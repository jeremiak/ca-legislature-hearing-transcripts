WERE FACING IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.739
FOURTEEN WHEN WE PASSED THE

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:15.573
SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.342

WHERE WE WERE. IN OUR FIFTH YEAR

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:45.136
OF DROUGHT. SO JUST MOVING ON

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.404
I'VE BEEN ASKED TO JUST GO OVER

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:47.572
THE KEY PROVISIONS OF

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:49.807
LEGISLATION UNLESS YOU'D LIKE TO

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:52.944
READ THE- MULTI PAGE. BILL BUT

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.480
IN SIMPLE TERMS. THE CONCEPT

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:58.950
WAS- CHIPS SUSTAINABLY MANAGE

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:00.652
YOUR GROUNDWATER BASIN AND THAT

00:32:00.718 --> 00:32:03.021
MEANS YOU HAVE TO OVER APPEAR IN

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.922
TWO YEARS. NOT TAKE OUT MORE

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:06.524
WATER THAN IS COMING IN AND IT

00:32:06.591 --> 00:32:08.660
TAKES A LOT LONGER TO HELP

00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:09.927
GROUND WATER PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:12.797
WE FEEL ABOUT HUNGER BASIN- THAN

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.500
IT DOES TO PUMP IT OUT. IT

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:18.436
CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTION

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.004
LOOKING AT WATER IS A PROPERTY

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.373
RIGHT UNDER STATE LAW. REQUIRES

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.709
LOCAL AGENCIES TO ADOPT

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:25.810
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN SO

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:29.347
WE STARTED WITH THE MOST.

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:31.215
MODERATE SEVERE. I'M BASINS THAT

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.750
WERE BEING OVER TO AND THAT'S

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.485
ABOUT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE OF

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.254
FIVE AND FIFTEEN BASINS AROUND

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:39.324
THE STATE. IT GAVE TOOLS AND

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.892
ABILITIES TO THE LOCAL

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:42.660
GROUNDWATER BASINS TO IMPLEMENT

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:43.995
THE PLANTS ASSISTANCE BY THE

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:47.799
STATE WATER BOARD OF STAFF OR

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.400
FUNDS FOR PARTICULAR STUDIES.

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:52.403
THE DJUDICATED BASINS THAT THE

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:57.308
TERM FOR THE LEGALLY- JUDICIALLY

00:32:57.375 --> 00:32:59.477
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE VERY

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:02.280
EXPENSIVE PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:05.216
BODY AND- TOPWATER LAWYERS TO

00:33:05.283 --> 00:33:07.952
DETERMINE HOW MUCH EACH ENTITY

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.154
OVER RELYING A GROUNDWATER BASIN

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.589
HOW MUCH WATER THEY GOT THE

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.324
PERCENTAGE OF WATER THAT WOULD

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.160
CHANGE UP AND DOWN AS AS THE

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.995
WATER LEVELS INDICATE AND

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:20.531
FINALLY IT PROVIDED THE STATE TO

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:21.866
BE A BACKSTOP OF LOCAL

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.501
GROUNDWATER AGENCY SCANNER WILL

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:24.902
MANAGE THEIR BASE AND THEN I

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.938
LEARNED THAT THAT ACTUALLY WAS A

00:33:27.004 --> 00:33:29.774
PRETTY GOOD THREAT- THE STATE

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:31.275
WATER BOARD WOULD COME IN AND

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.243
MANAGE IT FOR YOU IF YOU COULD

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.479
MANAGE IT SELF. BUT HERE WE ARE

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:38.149
A FEW YEARS LATER AND THE SOME

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.284
OF OUR- SEVERELY DRAFTED WATER

00:33:40.351 --> 00:33:42.353
AGENCIES. DID NOT SUBMIT PLANS

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:47.158
ON TIME. SO THAT THREE DAYS AT

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:49.560
THE TOP OF THE PAGE WERE KEY TO

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:51.262
THIS EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:54.465
ONLINE- WE HAD THE RESEARCH DONE

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:57.602

THE RESOURCES LEGACY FUND WAS

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:15.787
INVOLVED- BUT VERY GOOD UP TO

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:17.522

FRAME AND YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:43.414
LATER WAS SET INTO PLACE SO

DEMANDING CROPS WERE DOING YEAR

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.464
ROUND CROPS THAT REQUIRE WATER-

FIELDS CAN'T BE LATE FELLOW AND

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.769
HISTORICALLY DRY CONDITIONS AND

WE'RE LEARNING OUR SOIL THREE

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.372
EVEN MORE DRY THAN WHAT THEY

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:44.308
WERE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:47.044
FOURTEEN AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE

WATER TABLE COLLAPSES. THE LAND

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.982
SUBSIDES YOU KNOW WHAT THAT

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.783
MEANS SPECIALLY TO THE CENTRAL

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.495
ENERGY NOW TO PUMP DEEPER AND

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.864
DEEPER AND ABOUT RIGHT NOW ABOUT

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.666
18% OF ALL OUR ENERGY USE IN THE

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.701
STATE IS MOVING TREATING HER

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:15.540
PUMPING GROUNDWATER. SO THIS

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.375
THIS IS JUST AN OVERVIEW OF THE

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.644
TOP OF MY HEAD I TEND TO TALK IN

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.680
POWER POINTS ANYWAY ARE BULLETS-

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:25.583
ON IDEAS THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OF

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.183
AND YOU'RE GOING TO CERTAINLY

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.985
ADD TO HIM- DURING THESE

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.253
DISCUSSIONS THE FRONT PAGE OF

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.755
THE TIMES TODAY AS WELL AS

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:33.391
YESTERDAY. IS ON THIS TOPIC AND

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:36.294
I'M GETTING A PHONE CALLS UP

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.462
WHAT CAN BE DONE TO WHAT MAKES

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:40.565
IT MUCH STRONGER AND COMPLY WITH

00:36:40.631 --> 00:36:42.567
THE INTENT TO SO THAT WE- ARE

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:46.571
GROUND WATER WHICH IS 60% OF OUR

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:49.407
SUPPLY DURING. I YEARS. IS NOT.

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:52.109
OVER AND THE AND- PARTICULARLY

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:53.511
TO OTHER WATER USERS WHO ARE

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:56.414
LEFT HIGH AND DRY. SO WHAT ARE

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.816
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:01.018
STRENGTHEN SIGNUP PERHAPS. AND

00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:03.321
YOU'RE THE EXPERTS NOW BUT BRING

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:07.658
IN EVERYONE YOU CAN MEET WITH-

ARE WE OPERATING TOO MUCH

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:12.029
INSIDE. SILOS IS THE PART IN A

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:13.197
WATER RESOURCES WHICH IS FOR THE

00:37:13.264 --> 00:37:15.166
SUPPLY SIDE OF THE STATE WATER

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:16.500
BOARD CAN THEY BE. BETTER

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.369
COORDINATED HOW ABOUT THE

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:21.205
REGIONAL WATER- DISTRICTS IN THE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:23.708
AREA. HOW DO WE ACCELERATE THE

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.242
TIMETABLE FOR CYSTS WITHIN

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:29.146
ABILITY COMPLIANCE. CAN WE WAIT

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.882
TWENTY MORE YEARS. PROBABLY NOT

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:34.151
. A GROWING PROBLEM AND I'M SURE

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.386
YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF IT IS TO

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.254
BOOST ENSURE ACCESS TO SAFE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:38.656
DRINKING WATER THERE WAS

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.658
ACTUALLY STATE LEGISLATION BY

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:43.661
MIKE INGLIS DUTY CHOOSE A

HUSBAND ON INTO AT THE STATE

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.399
RIGHT THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE

ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER A

00:37:50.267 --> 00:37:52.436
LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT AND IT'S

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.905
GROWING- UP CONSIDER

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:56.474
CONSEQUENCES FOR PATIENTS WHO DO

THIS YEAR WHAT ARE THE

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:05.950
CONSEQUENCES HOW CAN WE HELP OF

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:09.186
HOW WE CAN HELP WE MAKE SURE

00:38:09.253 --> 00:38:10.488
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:11.989
FINDING OUT THAT THERE'S A

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.624
REASONABLE USE OF WATER DUE TO

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:16.694
OVER PUMPING- IS THERE A WAY TO

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:19.563
MAKE THEM LEGALLY COMPLY. IT'S

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.732
NOT OVER PUMPING AND I USED THE

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.701
TERM AND REASONABLE USE BECAUSE

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.604
THAT'S A LEGALLY. IMPORTANT TERM

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:30.174
THAT CAN BE. THAT CAN RESULT IN

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:33.344
POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION IF YOU ARE

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:34.979
OVER PUMPING IT'S IN A

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.814
REASONABLE NOT BENEFICIAL USED

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.050
TO THE WATER SUPPLY I'M A BIG

YOU MIGHT LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.428
TO RESTORE WATERSHEDS AND

00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:26.697
WETLANDS AND HOW THAT WOULD

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:29.667
INCREASE OUR WATER SUPPLY I'M ON

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:30.534
THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.071
RIGHT NOW AND- WATERSHEDS ARE

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.207
BEING FUNDED FOR RESTORATION AND

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.508
NEED FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS YEAR

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:38.909
AND ABOUT AS WHICH SHOULD

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:42.480
INCREASE DOWNSTREAM WATER.

00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:44.515
AVAILABILITY HOW CAN WE REDUCE

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:47.218
WATER INTENSIVE YEAR ROUND CROPS

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:49.220
ESPECIALLY IN THE OVER DRAFTED.

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:51.489
BASINS THIS IS FAR DIFFERENT

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.991
THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO THE AMOUNT

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:55.726
OF SPECIALLY. ALMONDS AND

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:58.395
PISTACHIOS- THAT ARE GROWN THAT

00:39:58.462 --> 00:40:03.000
REQUIRE INCREDIBLE BATTLE WATER

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.569
. DOES ILLEGAL CANNABIS

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:09.406
OPERATIONS TAKE. GROUNDWATER

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:11.609
FROM OUR LOCAL BASINS THAT'S A

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:14.111
GROWING PROBLEM THAT MAY NEED-

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:21.385
YOUR- YOUR- ADVICE- WHICH SHOULD

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.420
WATER AND HERE'S A POLITICALLY

00:40:23.487 --> 00:40:24.889
VERY HOT LEGAL QUESTION BE

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.824
REGULATED AS A PRIVATE PROPERTY

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.827
RIGHT OR IS IT ANY PUBLIC

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:32.263
BENEFIT. THAT'S SOMETHING

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:35.533
BUILDING TO TALK ABOUT IT. UNDER

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:38.502
THE BILL- NINETEEN FOURTEEN

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:40.437
RIGHTS IS DETERMINED- MAYBE

00:40:40.504 --> 00:40:42.239
THAT'S OUT OF DATE BUT I A AND

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.507
POLITICALLY THAT WOULD BE A

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:44.909
DIFFICULT DISCUSSION THAT

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:48.312
HAPPENED IT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.647
DISCUSSED. NEARLY 90% OF WHAT WE

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.949
GROWED REPORTEDLY NOW SENT

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:54.385
OVERSEAS AND NOT TO OUR STATE

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.953
AND THOSE ARE THOSE YEAR ROUND

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.489
CROPS. LOCAL GROUNDWATER BASINS

00:40:58.556 --> 00:41:01.025
WANT TO REPORT MANAGER ON SUPPLY

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.727
WHAT WE DO SOME CAN'T OR WON'T

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.664

AS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.737
SURVIVAL AS A STATE SO WE'RE

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:15.272
GOING TO HAVE TO USE T ONCE IF

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.708
NOT TWICE. REDUCED AMOUNT THE

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:20.010
USE AND RECYCLE WATER AND THAT

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:23.347
MEANS EVERYONE- COOLEY IN URBAN

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:24.148

ELEMENTS IN MAKING. SIGMAR LAW.

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:14.518
AS SENATOR PER NO WE HAVE

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.186
SUPPORT FOR THE F. FROM A HOST

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.555
OF ORGANISE. RANGING FROM THE

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.357
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER

00:44:20.424 --> 00:44:22.726
AGENCIES TO THE WATER FOUNDATION

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:25.095
AND THEY ALSO PLAYED. AN

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.631
INSTRUMENTAL ROLE. UNDENIABLE

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.566
REALITY COMPELLED THE ADOPTION

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:33.003
OF SIGMA IN DROUGHT YEARS 60% OR

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.672
MORE OF OUR WATER SUPPLY COMES

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:38.075
FROM GROUNDWATER. DECADES OF

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:40.077
OVER DRAFTING HAD LED TO AFFECTS

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:41.879
SUCH AS SERIOUS SUBSIDENCE IN

00:44:41.945 --> 00:44:43.380
THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO SEE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.883
WATER INTRUSION TWO DRINKING

00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:47.451
WATER WELLS SERVING ENTIRE

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.553
COMMUNITIES DRYING UP. ALTHOUGH

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:51.155
IT HAD BEEN DISCUSSED FOR FORTY

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:54.024
YEARS CALIFORNIA HAD NEVER HAD

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:56.060
STATE REGULATION OF GROUNDWATER

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:57.995
INDEED CALIFORNIA STOOD OUT AS

00:44:58.062 --> 00:45:00.130
THE ONLY STATE IN THE WEST TO

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:03.033
NOT DO SO. FIVE TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.735
WE COULD SIMPLY NO LONGER AFFORD

00:45:04.802 --> 00:45:07.438
TO WAIT ANY LONGER. THE DESIGN

00:45:07.504 --> 00:45:09.440
AND STRUCTURE OF SIGMA IS

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:13.077
UNUSUAL IF NOT UNIQUE. AT THE

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:15.345
CORE IT WAS FASHIONED ON

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:17.314
EXPERIENCE- ACTUALLY THAT I HAD

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.949
AS A SACRAMENTO COUNTY

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:24.688
SUPERVISOR. AT ONE POINT WE WERE

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.723
COME UP WITH THE PROPOSAL. FOR

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.259
MEASURES WHICH WOULD BRING US

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:29.860
INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE CLEAN

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.962
AIR ACT HOWEVER AMONG THE

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.564
VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.832
INTEREST GROUPS WE COULD NOT

00:45:34.898 --> 00:45:36.300
SEEM TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:37.701
MEASURES THAT WOULD PROJECT TO

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:40.471
MEET OUR FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS.

00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:42.272
AFTER PROTECTED A PROTRACTED

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.675
PERIOD WITHOUT A RESOLUTION

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.010
USEPA TOLD US IF WE FAIL TO

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.446
OFFER A SUITABLE PLAN THEY WOULD

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:51.582
IMPOSE ONE ON US. THEY DANGLED

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:53.350
SUCH RESTRICTIONS AS ALLOWING

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:55.853
DRIVING ONLY EVERY OTHER DAY

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:57.621
BASED ON LICENSE PLATE NUMBERS

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:59.656
AND PARKING RANGE THAT WOULD BE

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.425
ASTRONOMICAL. THEY PLAYED THE

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:05.062
QUINTESSENTIAL BAD COP. GIVEN

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.597
THEIR THREAT TO NO SURPRISE WE

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:08.932
CAME UP WITH A PLAN. OF LOCAL

00:46:08.999 --> 00:46:10.534
DEVELOPED MEASURES WHICH

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:14.438
SATISFIED BOTH EPA AND US. WE

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:16.607
APPLIED THAT LESSON WHEN

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:19.209
STRUCTURING SIGMA IT WAS FOUNDED

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.811
ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT LOCAL

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.479
OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES ARE IN

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:24.414
THE BEST POSITION TO ADDRESS

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:24.848
LOCAL CONDITIONS AND

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:27.351
CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN GIVEN CLEAR

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:30.187
DIRECTION AND SPECIFIC GOALS WE

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:32.356
GAVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES A LARGE

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:33.824
DEGREE OF DISCRETION AND FORMING

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:36.326
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.228
AGENCIES OR GSA'S. ALTHOUGH THE

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:40.664
STATUTE IS CLEAR THE GSA'S

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.032
EITHER ON THEIR OWN OR IN

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.368
COMBINATION WITH OTHER GSA'S

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:46.770
MUST ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY IN

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:47.871
THEIR BASE AND THEY COULDN'T

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:50.774
AVOID IT BY SOME ARTIFICE. OR

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.377
CONSTRUCT WE UNDERSTOOD THAT

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:54.545
MOVING TO SUSTAINABILITY WOULD

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.613
IMPOSE AN ARDUOUS TECHNICAL AND

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.315
PROGRAMMATIC CHALLENGE FOR LOCAL

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.551
ENTITIES. THEREFORE WE DIRECTED

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:01.985
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.987
RESOURCES WOULD BE GIVEN THE

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:05.689
ROLE OF ASSISTING GSA'S

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:07.558
INFORMING AND ONCE FORMED IN

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:10.160
MEETING THE CHALLENGES GSA'S

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:11.962
FACED. THE PRIMARY

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:13.997
RESPONSIBILITY OF GSA'S IS TO

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.132
PRODUCE GROUNDWATER

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.334
SUSTAINABILITY PLANS OR G. S.

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:20.604
P.'S WHICH IDENTIFY AN OUTLINE

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.272
THE ROADMAP TO SUSTAINABILITY.

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:25.042
SIGNAL STRUCTURE WAS ALSO BUILT

00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:26.810
TO INCLUDE STATE REVIEW AND

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:29.146
APPROVAL OF G. S. P.'S SO THAT

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:30.647
THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:33.617
FOR GSA'S TO DEVELOP AND ADOPT

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:36.019
REAL AND MEASURABLE PLANS SUCH

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.688
REVIEW IS ESSENTIAL SINCE WE

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.022
REALIZED THAT SOME LOCAL

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.724
OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITIES MIGHT

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.926
FIND IT TOO DIFFICULT OR BEYOND

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:44.595
WILLING TO DO WHAT WAS NECESSARY

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.897
TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL.

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:49.433
IMPLEMENTATION FINALLY. WE

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:51.435
DESIGNATED THE WATER RESOURCES

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.970
CONTROL BOARD TO STEP IN AND

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.571
IMPLEMENT PLANS AND MEASURES TO

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.872
REACH SUSTAINABILITY IF

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:58.308
NECESSARY. WITH THE HOPE THAT

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.010
THE SPECTER OF THE STATE PLAYING

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.613
SUCH A ROLE WOULD BE COMPELLING

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.082
TO LOCAL OFFICIALS TO TAKE

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:07.184
ACTION ON THEIR OWN INSTEAD. SO

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:09.653
SIMPLY PUT SEGMENT IS STRUCTURED

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.088
TO GIVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:12.656
AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY IN

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.591
THE FIRST INSTANCE TO DEVELOP

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.393
AND IMPLEMENT PLANS TO REACH

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.462
GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY. IT

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:19.363
IS THE AUTHORITY AND

00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:21.164
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.766
OF WATER RESOURCES TO BOTH

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:25.669
ASSIST. LOCAL EFFORTS AND TO

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:28.038
REQUIRE ADHERENCE TO THE OVER

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:30.641
ARCHING PURPOSE OF CIGNA CIGNA

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:33.677
NAMELY REACHING SUSTAINABILITY.

00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:35.145
AND IT IS THE ROLE OF THE WATER

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:37.547
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STEP

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.449
IN AND TAKE THE PLACE OF LOCAL

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:42.452
ENTITIES THAT CANNOT OR WILL NOT

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.621
FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:46.990
ENSURE THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.091
WE WOULD BE ON TRACK TOWARDS

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:52.396
SUSTAINABLE. GROUNDWATER BASINS

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:54.531
. SECOND THE SELECTION OF TWENTY

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:56.199
YEARS AS THE HORIZON BY WHICH

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:58.702
BASINS MUST REACH SUSTAINABILITY

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.871
WITH THE BALANCING OF TWO

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:03.273
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS. FIRST

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.608
THE URGENCY OF RESTORING

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.643
GROUNDWATER VIABILITY WAS

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:08.745
MANIFEST WITH MANY BASE AND

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.881
SUBJECT TO SO MUCH OVER DRAFTING

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.949
FOR SO MANY YEARS BUT NOT ONLY

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:14.418
WERE PROPERTY OWNERS DRILLING

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.153
DEEPER AND DEEPER WELLS WITH

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:18.188
SHALLOWER WELLS DRYING UP. BUT

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.757
SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDENCE OF AS

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:22.592
MUCH AS FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FEET

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.461
HAD OCCURRED IN A NUMBER OF

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.930
AREAS. SECOND BECAUSE OVER

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.398
DRAFTING HAD TAKEN PLACE FOR

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:32.469
DECADES. IN BASINS INTO A

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.905
SUSTAINABLE CONDITION. OBVIOUSLY

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:37.574
WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME. NOW

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.543
BALLOTS IN THOSE TEN THINGS

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.712
NEVERTHELESS A GSA CANNOT SIMPLY

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:44.681
DELAY TAKING ACTION UNTIL TEN OR

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.817
FIFTEEN YEARS IN THE FUTURE. ASK

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:49.286
OUR MAINS URGENT ESPECIALLY WITH

00:49:49.353 --> 00:49:51.355
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.523
MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.291
SUSTAINABILITY REQUIRED

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.560
UNDERSTATEMENT IS AN ONGOING

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.195
TEST WITH PERIODIC FIVE YEAR

00:49:58.261 --> 00:49:59.963
REVIEWS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:04.735
WATER RESOURCES OF EACH PLANT.

00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:06.269
THE THIRD POINT. THIS MORNING I

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:08.905
WANT TO JUST. MAKE A COMMENT

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:10.741
ABOUT IS THAT CIGNA UNDERSCORES

00:50:10.807 --> 00:50:12.609
THE PRINCIPLE OF ACCOUNTING FOR

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.511
THE INTERESTS OF ALL BENEFICIAL

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.913
USERS. HISTORICALLY THOSE WITH

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.448
GREATER ECONOMIC POWER AND

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.684
RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RELY

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.919
ON GROUNDWATER EVEN AS AQUIFER'S

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.421
HAVE DECLINED AND OTHER USERS

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.190
HAVE LOST. THEIR ACCESS OR

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:29.259
WATCHED IT DIMINISH ESPECIALLY

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:30.994
SMALL FARMERS AND VULNERABLE

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.797
COMMUNITIES. SIGMAR RECOGNIZES

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.932
THAT SUSTAINABILITY MEANS ALL

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.301
BENEFICIAL USERS MUST ENJOY

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.370
ACCESS TO GROUNDWATER ON A FAIR

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:43.206
AND REASONABLE BASIS EVEN AS WE

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.908
ENSURE THERE IS NO AS THE

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.676
STATUTE BUT SAID CHRONIC

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.979
LOWERING OF GROUNDWATER LEVELS

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:53.083
INDICATING A SIGNIFICANT AND ON

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.285
REASONABLE DEPLETION OF SUPPLY.

00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:56.753
IN THE MIDST OF DROUGHT IN

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.989
TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:00.824
ACTED TO SEPARATE COURSE FOR THE

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.093
STATE TO REGULATE FOR THE FIRST

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.929
TIME A MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:08.865
OUR GROUNDWATER. SOME OBSERVERS

00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:10.233
CALLED IT THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.369
CALIFORNIA WATER LAW IN MORE

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:14.704
THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS. THE

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.473
CURRENT DROUGHT AND THE GROWING

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.708
REALITY THE CLIMATE CHANGE WILL

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.944
ONLY INTENSIFY. DICTATES THAT WE

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.112
INSIST THAT SEGMENT BE

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.814
RIGOROUSLY AND FAITHFULLY

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.682
CARRIED OUT TO PROTECT OUR

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:28.285
HEALTH OUR ECONOMY AND OUR

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:32.589
ENVIRONMENT. THANKS VERY MUCH.

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:34.191
AUSTIN'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.460
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- BEFORE GOING TO

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.528
IN AND OTHER ANY QUESTIONS THE

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:42.766
COMMITTEE. FOR COMMENTS. I DON'T

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.168
SEE YEAH SURE ASSEMBLY WERE

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.070
LACKING YEAH PLEASE PARDON ME IF

00:51:47.137 --> 00:51:48.705
I MISSED BECAUSE I ARRIVED A

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.007
LITTLE BIT TARDY BUT- ONE OF THE

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:53.043
BIG CRISIS POINTS THAT WE HAVE I

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:54.478
LIVE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:57.214
AREA IN THE DESERT WHERE-

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.382
GROUNDWATER HAS ALWAYS BEEN. A

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:00.517
FOCUS BUT NOW WE HAVE THE

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.152
ILLEGAL OR ILLICIT CANNABIS

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:04.087
GROWERS THERE AND WE'RE WE'RE

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:05.822
DEALING NOT ONLY WITH WATER

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:08.325
CONTAMINATION AS AS A PROBLEM

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.293
BUT ALSO WATER THEFT AND OUR

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.528
LOCAL AGENCIES ARE HAVING A VERY

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:15.298
DIFFICULT TIME. MANAGING OF

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:17.434
THESE BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS AND

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.436
I WONDERED IF YOU HAD AT LEAST

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:26.576
AWARENESS OF THE SITUATION. THE

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:28.245
SERVICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.213
DICKINSON RIGHT DOWN TO THAT OR

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.749
CENTER POWERPOINT- I WILL I

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.217
DON'T KNOW IF CENTER PROBABLY IS

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:37.621
STILL AVAILABLE BUT- AND IT'S

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.990
ONLY MEMBER LACKEY- CENTER

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:41.858
PAVLEY IN FACT MENTION THAT IN

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:44.628
IN HER REMARKS- IT WAS NOT AN

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:47.564
ISSUE FRANKLY- IN TWENTY

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:49.833
FOURTEEN SO IT IS NOT ADDRESSED-

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.201
IT LEAST IT WASN'T AN ISSUE THAT

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:53.003
AROSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.204
CONSIDERATION OF. OF THE

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.872
LEGISLATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:58.542
SO IT'S NOT ADDRESS DIRECTLY- BY

00:52:58.608 --> 00:53:00.944
THE STATUTE I THINK IT IS.

00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:03.780
CLEARLY A PROBLEM- NOT ONLY IN

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.315
IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE BUT IN

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.050
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.319
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT- I

00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:12.656
THINK- YOUR GOOD ATTENTION TO-

00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:16.059
CURRENTLY- IT DOES IS A VERY

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:20.196
MUCH NEEDED SO- WE WOULD EXPECT

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:22.566
I THINK UNDER CURRENT LAW THE

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:25.735
TYPICAL MECHANISMS FOR-

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:28.838
POLICING- AND ENFORCING THE LAW

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.073
WITH RESPECT TO CONTAMINATED

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.910
WATER. THE ILLEGAL USE OF WATER

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:36.012
TO APPLY BUT THERE MAY BE MORE

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.182
SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT- YOU YOU

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.784
AS THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:44.988
LEGISLATURE BELIEVE. ARE ARE

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:46.656
NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE. I

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.325
BELIEVE WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.926
FOR ME ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:52.195

PROBABLY FOR LEADERSHIP IN THIS

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:58.835
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AREA. AND

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.437
IT'S ALWAYS I THINK IMPRESSIVE

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:01.638
TO LOOK IN HINDSIGHT AND SEE HOW

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:04.374
HELPFUL IT IS TO GET US TO WHERE

00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:05.642
WE ARE TODAY. IS ALREADY

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.143
CONTINUE MENTIONED THAT WHEN YOU

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.380
PASS THIS BILL. YOU BELIEVE THE

00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:12.215
SCEPTER OF THE STATE TAKING OVER

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:13.717
WAS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:14.884
LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO WHAT WE

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:16.553
WANTED THEM TO DO TO SUSTAINABLY

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.421
MANAGE GROUNDWATER. WHEN WE LOOK

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:19.823
AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE SEE

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:21.024
THAT THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.158
NOT DONE THAT. AND WE'RE LOOKING

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:24.661
AT SORT OF IN. A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:54:24.728 --> 00:54:27.197
IT MAY BE UNDER THAT- CONTROL

00:54:27.263 --> 00:54:29.666
AND GIVEN THAT. I GUESS I WONDER

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:30.734
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.669
ON THAT WHERE WE SHOULD GO FROM

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:34.504
THERE AND ARE THERE OTHER MEANS

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:38.375
OF ENFORCEMENT THAT YOU THINK WE

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:40.343
SHOULD CONSIDER. WELL I THANK

YOU FOR THE QUESTION- ADAM CHAIR

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.881
I THINK THAT- WE TRYING TO

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:47.617
DESIGN AN APPROACH THAT WOULD

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.654
ULTIMATELY- STIMULATE. LOCAL

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.856
OFFICIALS TO IN EFFECT BITE THE

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:54.824
BULLET AND WE KNOW THAT THIS CAN

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:57.961
BE A VERY DIFFICULT. UNDERTAKING

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:59.829
AND A NUMBER OF PLACES AROUND

00:54:59.896 --> 00:55:02.132
THE STATE BUT THE- BUT THE- THE

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:05.635
PROCESS OF. HAVING D. W. R.

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.937
REVIEW PLANS TO COMMENT ON PLANS

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.740
TO REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT- PLANS.

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.275
ARE UPGRADING THE PLANS AS THEY

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.877
ARE GOING THROUGH NOW WITH THE

00:55:13.943 --> 00:55:16.346
WITH A NUMBER OF GSA'S. AND THEN

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.815
IF THERE'S A FAILURE TO DO SO TO

00:55:18.882 --> 00:55:20.717
PUT THAT AND TO PUT THOSE BASINS

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:22.619
IN A PROBATIONARY STATUS THAT

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.221
BRINGS IN THE WHAT THE- STATE.

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:28.992
WATER BOARD. TO TAKE- I'M MORE

00:55:29.059 --> 00:55:31.227
ACTIVE ROLE I MEAN ALL THESE ARE

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.396
STEPS THAT WE THAT WE DESIGNED

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:36.800
IN WITH WITH THE HOPE FRANKLY

00:55:36.866 --> 00:55:39.335
THAT- THAT. LOCAL OFFICIALS AND

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.638
COMMUNITIES- WHAT DO WHAT WHAT

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:44.207
HAS TO BE DONE- IS THERE MORE

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.975
ENFORCEMENT OR- ADDITIONAL

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:48.211
MEASURES REQUIRED AT AT AT THIS

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.313
STAGE. IT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.248
SOON TO KNOW THE ANSWER. TO

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:54.617
THAT. UNTIL WE SEE HOW THE

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:57.487
PROCESS WORKS WITH. WITH RESPECT

00:55:57.554 --> 00:56:00.156
TO THE POTENTIAL FOR D. W. R.

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:03.326
REVIEW AND- PROBATIONARY STATUS

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:05.495
FOR BASINS TO SEE IF THAT. IF

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:08.898
THAT SEQUENCE. OF TEPS

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:11.401
ACTUALLY- IS EFFECTIVE IN IN

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:14.370
GETTING THOSE- BASINS AND GSA'S

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:16.272
THAT HAVE BEEN. SOMEWHAT MORE

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:19.142
RETICENT- TO STEP UP TO AND IN

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:23.980
FACT TO DO SO. TO LIVE UP TO

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:28.084
THEIR X. THERE- I THINK WE WILL

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:36.092
WAIT AND SEE. ANY OTHER AG CAN

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:39.028
WE HONOR THAT PLEASE YEAH OUT I

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:41.898
AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.667
DICKINSON THERE ISN'T ONE DIRECT

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.736
ANSWER HERE BUT I THINK THAT THE

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.705
COMBINATION OF CHOICES HERE

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:52.175
FIRST OF ALL WHY DID THOSE-

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.376
GALLAGHER BASIN TO HAVE FIVE

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:55.445
YEARS NOT COMPLY WITH THE

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.814
COMPLETED PLAN WHICH IS JUST

00:56:57.881 --> 00:57:00.350
STEP ONE ON TIME. AND HOW MUCH

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:04.254
STAFF DOES THE STATE HAVE TO

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.689
PRINT WE CAN AND DO THAT FOR

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:07.757
THEM THAT'S GOING TO BE A

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:10.160
CHALLENGE YET HOW MUCH ARE YOU

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:11.427
WILLING TO SPEND THIS IS A GOOD

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.129
TIME GENERAL FUND WISE IF THE

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:17.066
PRIORITY. BUT ALSO HOW CAN WE

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:19.135
STOP- THE- THAT ARE GOING ON

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:21.070
THAT ARE ACCELERATING THE

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.505
PROBLEMS SO YOU HAVE. THE

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:25.441
ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY BUT THEN

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:29.879
ARE THERE. ACTRESSES FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:32.549
IT SHOULD THOSE BASINS THAT ARE

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:34.584
SEVERELY OVER PUMPING THE

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:37.520
GROUNDWATER SPECIALLY IN AREAS

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.923
THAT ARE AFFECTING PEOPLE WHO

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.357
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:44.527
DRINKING WATER SHOULD THEY BE

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.996
ABLE TO CONTINUE TO GROW YEAR

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:49.632
ROUND CROPS THAT ARE VERY WATER

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:53.636
INTENSIVE. SHOULD THEY BE ABLE

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.772
TO A FEW OF THOSE PEOPLE PUMP

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.774
ALL THE WATER TO THE BOTTOM IT

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:00.476
MAY TAKE SOME. LEGAL CHALLENGES

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:03.313
ON BENEFICIAL USE- I'M NOT A

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:06.583
LAWYER. OR MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:08.585
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO PUT

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.987
EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AND I

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:12.655
WOULD SUGGEST ALSO GOING BACK

00:58:12.722 --> 00:58:13.890
AND LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WHO

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.491
DID THOSE EXCELLENT REPORTS AT

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.594
THE BEGINNING WATER FOR THINGS

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.964
THAT THE RESOURCES LEGACY FUND.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.398
MAY DO THEY HELPED WITH THE

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:24.367
FUNDING OF THAT WATER FOUNDATION

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.402
PLANS WHAT WOULD AWKWARD

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.171
SUGGESTION DOING BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:30.139
THE STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.641
ENOUGH THAT'S WHY THIS HEARING

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:34.644
IS IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:35.945
PROBABLY HEAR FROM A VARIETY OF

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.981
PEOPLE BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO

00:58:38.047 --> 00:58:42.018
STOP WHERE THE ABUSES ARE.

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.052
ESPECIALLY IN THE MODERATE TO

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:46.055
SEVERELY OVER DRAFT BASINS. USE

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:49.792
THE THIRTY THIRTY PLAN TO TRY

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:53.529
TO. SAVE THE FINALLY THE

00:58:53.596 --> 00:58:55.265
GROUNDWATER BUT THE WATERSHED

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:59.168
FROM- BEING ABUSED AS WELL AND

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:02.538
CRACK DOWN ON PEOPLE THAT FOR

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.941
WHATEVER REASON CAN'T OR WON'T

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:07.043
MANAGE THEIR GROUNDWATER BASIN

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:08.912
CAN YOU IMAGINE SHARING A

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:11.247
PROPERTY WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:13.483
ONE PROPERTY OWNER IN YOUR GROUP

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:15.985
OF FIVE NOT BEING ABLE. USING UP

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.888
ALL THE LAND SO- THAT SOMETHING

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:22.792
IS NOT WORKING AND I THINK YOU

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.627
NEED TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:26.930
REASONS. BUT AT IN CONJUNCTION

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:31.668
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUAL BASINS.

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:33.870
AND MANAGER TO ADD ONE FURTHER

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:35.838
NOTE ON ON THIS I ALSO THINK

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:38.775
THERE'S A ROLE FOR INCENTIVIZING

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:41.477
LOCALITIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:45.248
SO- FUNDING THAT THAT- COMES

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:47.183
THROUGH THE DROUGHT AND WATER

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:51.087
RESILIENCE PACKAGE FOR EXAMPLE-

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.522
TO AUGMENT THE SWEET PROGRAM OR

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:55.058
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR MOVING TO.

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:56.960
TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR

00:59:57.026 --> 01:00:00.229
WATER- THE- MULTI BENEFIT LAND

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.966
RE PURPOSING PROGRAM THAT WAS

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.534
INCLUDED IN THE IN THE BUDGET

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.803
LAST YEAR- I THINK HAS

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.439
TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO HELP.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:11.374
LAND LANDOWNERS IN VARIOUS

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:14.344
PLACES MOVE MOVE AWAY FROM- MORE

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:18.881
INTENSIVE USE OF WATER- TO- THE

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:22.485
USING PLANNED FOR- OTHER

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:25.421
PURPOSES AND- RECHARGING

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:26.990
GROUNDWATER IN THE IN THE

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.491
PROCESS SO I THINK THAT'S A

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:30.760
PROGRAM THAT THAT DEFINITELY-

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:33.129
SHOULD BE SHOULD BE AUGMENTED-

WITH THIS- THAT GROUNDWATER DATA

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.289
AND TOOLS ARE READILY AVAILABLE-

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.924
I SHOULD POINT OUT JUST

PROCESS FOR THE INITIAL REVIEW

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.297
INCOMPLETE- WHICH REALLY

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.066
IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.033
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.202
DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE PLANS THAT

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.071
WE HAVE FOR THOSE AGENCIES A

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.672

COMPLIANCE- ARE THE REGULATIONS

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:20.268
IN THE SCHOOLS. I THINK IT- VERY

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:22.804
EASTSTRICT STANDARD WE WERE

CONTROL AND ACHIEVE

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.915
SUSTAINABILITY BUT THEY MUST DO

01:17:33.982 --> 01:17:36.351
IT UNDER A PLAN THAT IS

GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:06.181
ECOSYSTEMS- AND WHAT THEY NEED

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:12.521
TO WORK OUT ITS. TWENTY YEARS.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:15.457
WHAT- I'M WAS ARE GOING TO. FIND

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.159
WHAT BROUGH LEVEL SECTION

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.627
STORAGE OF TITANS TO WATER

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:20.195
QUALITY C. WATER INTRUSION INTO

01:18:20.262 --> 01:18:22.297
OF INTERCONNECT SERVICE WATERS

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.499
ALL THESE SECTION. ABOUT WORKING

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:27.235
BY DO WE ARE TO COMPLY WITH THE

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:29.037
RAGS- BUT WE REALLY FOCUSED

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.873
INITIALLY ON THIS DENTAL

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.675
MANAGEMENT CRITERIA HAVE THEY-

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:37.045
ADEQUATELY DETERMINED- WHETHER.

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:39.648
IS SIGNIFICANT REASONABLE TAX ON

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:41.516
ALL OF OUR USERS FROM THE SIX

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.785
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS. SO WE

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.321
WANTED TO- BESIDES THAT IDENTIFY

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.722
WHETHER THEY USE THE BEST

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:50.926
SCIENCE AND DATA- WHAT WAS

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.527
REALLY THEIR PLAN TO MITIGATE OR

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.663
ELIMINATE OVERDRAFT AND DO THEY

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:57.799
HAVE A- ADEQUATE SUITE OF

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.768
PROJECTS OF MANAGEMENT ACTIONS-

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.370
THAT WOULD. LEAD AND IF I CHOOSE

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:03.472
TO STAND ABILITY OVER TWENTY

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:05.507
YEARS- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.675
INITIAL LIST OF PROJECT

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:10.378
MANAGEMENT ACTIONS- MAYBE OUR

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.280
PULLING IN AREAS PROJECTS NEED

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.849
TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THE

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.584
DEVELOPING ALLOCATION SCHEMES.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.352
AND SO ONE OF OUR CORRECTION

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.855
ACTIONS AS WE DO WANT IT A

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.957
PRETTY BROAD SUITE OF OUR

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.925
CONTINGENCIES IN THE EVENT SOME

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.060
OF THOSE PROJECTS MANAGEMENT

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:33.235
ACTIONS- DOCTOR FOR WHICH- WE

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:35.604
WILL ALSO IN. BY COMMENT- WE PUT

01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.105
OFFER PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL AS

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.508
- FOR THE LOW AGE. TO HAVE A COM

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.609
PERIOD- WE DO REVIEW ALL THE

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:43.011
COMMENTS WE'VE GOT OVER FIVE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.613
HUNDRED COMMENTS. FROM THE

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:47.649
PUBLIC ON THE PLANS- AND MORE

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.918
MORE THAN EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS AND

01:19:49.985 --> 01:19:51.887
ORGANIZATIONS. SO NOW I'M GOING

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.055
TO SWITCH- AND TRIED TO THE

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:56.324
CURRENT STATUS OF WHAT WAS BEING

01:19:56.391 --> 01:20:01.663
IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S NOT PLEASE. SO WE DID IT OUT OF THE TWENTY

01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:04.166
PLANS ARE SUBMITTED- WE DID

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:07.002
APPROVED EIGHT PLANTS- AND THE

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:09.704
MAP ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE I

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:13.341
IDENTIFIES- THOSE BASINS WORK-

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:15.577
AND AGAIN WE FOUND YOU KNOW EVEN

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.412
WITH APPROVED PLANS NO PLAN IS

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:20.115
PERFECT- WE DO RECOMMEND A

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.516
NUMBER OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.752
ALL THE STAFF IN A MOMENT- AND

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.854
THEN REALLY THE SUB SUB FOR THE

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.223
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND THOSE

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:31.526
OTHER- FILE ITEMS WE IDENTIFIED-

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:34.029
FOR OUR FULL REVIEW OUR FULL

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.163
FIVE YEAR REVIEW WHICH IS A

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.666
NOTHER COMPLIANCE CHECKPOINT.

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.301
ARE TO DETERMINE ARE THEY ON

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.336
TRACK OTHER YOU KNOW THAT PLAN

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:44.739
IS COMPLIANT- BUT- THEY WALKING

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.007
THE WALK THEY ACTUALLY

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:47.409
IMPLEMENTING AND TAKING THOSE

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.778
ACTIONS ARE NEEDED TO REACH

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:52.247
STAND ABILITY AND IT ANYTIME IF

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:54.516
WE FIND AN AGENCY IS FAILING TOP

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.518
LIVE. LIVE UP TO WHAT THEY HAVE

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:58.353
PUT INTO THEIR PLAN OKAY NOT

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.422
GOING TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY WE

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:02.157
CAN GO BACK AND CALL THE PLAN

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.092
AND ADEQUATE AND HAVE THE-

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.027
RESULT IN. ORDER TO PENSION AND

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:10.599
TELL THEY GET THEIR PLAN. AND

01:21:10.665 --> 01:21:12.901
THEIR ACTIONS BACK ON TRACK-

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:15.470
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.072
TWELFTH PLANS THAT WE'RE

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:21.710
GETTING- INCOMPLETE WE'RE BASED

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.579
UPON NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES AND

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:26.881
THEY NEED TO- CORRECT THOSE

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.417
DEFICIENCIES- WITHIN A HUNDRED

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.953
EIGHTY DAYS. OUT ONE THING ON

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:34.589
OUR- OUR REFUSES WE REVIEWED THE

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.791
PLANS AS THEY WERE SUBMITTED IN

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.627
JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY A

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:41.363
NUMBER OF THE AGENCIES SINCE

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:43.331
TWENTY TWENTY IT- ADAPTED THEIR

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:46.835
PLAN BASED UPON NEW INFORMATION

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.803
HEARD GOTTEN- THE DATA. OR HAD

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:51.973
TAKEN DIFFERENT APPROACHES- SO

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.442
AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE- YEP

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:56.311
SPOCK THE DEFICIENCIES WE EXPECT

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.946
THAT THEY MAY BE PROVIDING US

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.114
MORE UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:01.182
PLAN OR MANY ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.151
TO REDO OF THE APPROACH THAT

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:06.354
TAKEN TO BE COMPLIANT- BROWN

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.089
SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT EVEN THESE

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:11.159
PLANTS THAT HAVE. BEEN DEEMED

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.827
COMPLETE AND HAVE CERTAIN

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:15.930
DEFICIENCIES MANY HAVE TAKEN

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:18.667
CONSIDERABLE STEPS TO- TOWARDS

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:20.468
SUSTAINABILITY INCLUDING

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.537
RECHARGE WATER SUPPLY

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:25.173
AUGMENTATION AND- ALLOCATION

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.275
REDUCTIONS TO REDUCE THE DEMAND

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.411
ON THE BASIS. SO WE'RE EXPECTING

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:31.246
THEM TO CONTINUE THAT AS WE GO

01:22:31.313 --> 01:22:33.248
THROUGH THAT CORRECTING THE

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.550
DEFICIENCIES IT MAY WE WANT THEM

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.751
TO CONTINUE ON THAT PATH TO

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.820
SUSTAINABILITY BUT IT MIGHT JUST

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:40.422
CHANGE WHERE THE GOAL LINE IS

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:44.359
THAT THEY NEED TO GET TO

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:44.959
RESPECT BOTH OF THE CRITERIA.

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:46.628
NOW I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH. SO

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:48.563
THAT MAKE IT OVER ARCHING ISSUES

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:54.069
WITH PHOTOS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:55.370
SO SOME OF THE COMMON ERROR

01:22:55.437 --> 01:22:58.807
DEFICIENCIES- ONE WAS-

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.509
SUBSIDENCE- AND THAT WAS COMMON

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:03.311
IN A NUMBER OF BASINS AND THE

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:05.680
ONE THING THAT SIGNAL DOES CALL

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:08.049
FOR IS THE ELIMINATION OR

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.618
MINIMIZATION OF SUBSIDES- NUMBER

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.587
PLANS REDUCE FINE BASED UPON OUR

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.689
REVIEW. I DID A LOT FOR

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:17.258
CONTINUED SUBSIDENCE- AND ALSO

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.494
DID NOT FULLY ADDRESS ALL THE

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.829
GROUND WATER USES AND USES THE

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:21.863
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAY BE

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:25.100
AFFECTED AND DESCRIBING THAT.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.202
WITH WATER QUALITY A NUMBER OF

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:31.773
THE PLANS DID- RESULTED IN A AND

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.376
IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING- WIND OR

01:23:34.442 --> 01:23:35.977
HUNDREDS OF WELLS THAT COULD BE

01:23:36.044 --> 01:23:38.513
DE WATERED- AND GO DRY UPON

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.417
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANT. NOW

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:45.220
WHAT WE ARE. REQUIRED THEM TO DO

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:48.623
IS TO- DO COOL THINGS IS EITHER

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.191
COME BACK AND JUSTIFY HOW THEY

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.494
FEEL THAT THAT IS NOT SIGNIFICAN

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.963
AND REASONABLE SOMEONE'S WATER

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:57.866
SUPPLY GOING DRY. GIVEN THE- A

01:23:57.932 --> 01:23:59.467
MANDATE ON HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:03.104
OR ALTERNATIVELY COME BACK AND-

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:04.806
BUT IN MITIGATION MEASURES AND

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.441
OTHER AUGMENTATION TO EITHER BE

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.009
PROTECTIVE OF OUR DRINKING WATER

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.979
SOURCES OR TO MITIGATE- WELLS

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.781
GOING DRY NUMBER OF AGENCIES

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:15.250
HAVE PROPOSED DOING THIS BUT A

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:16.985
NUMBER OF ISSUES THEY DID NOT-

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.988
WE FOUND THAT. ALSO PROMPTED US

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:22.223
TO PUT OUT AND DEVELOP GUIDANCE-

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.726
WHICH WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AND-

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:26.828
WHAT THE NEXT STOP FOR SIX

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.496
MONTHS OR SO GUIDANCE ON ON

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:29.864
WATER QUALITY AND PROTECTION IN

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:33.568
JACKET WATER- IN WATER QUALITY

01:24:33.635 --> 01:24:35.937
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND- IS

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.406
BASINS THAT ARE ARE GOING TO

01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.008
HELP THE CHRONICLE OF PATIENTS

01:24:40.074 --> 01:24:42.043
GLOBAL OF HISTORIC LOWS I HAVE

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.745
AN OBLIGATION TO DESCRIBE TO

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.814
KEEP CLOSER TRACK ON WHAT THAT

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.849
IS GOING TO DO FOR WATER QUALITY

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.051
ISSUES WITHIN THEIR BASE. SO

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:52.420
WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR M. SCRIBE

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.622
OR OVERSIGHT ON AND TRACKING OF

01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:56.624
WATER QUALITY DEPLETION OF

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.059
INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATERS

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.694
THIS WAS A COMMON DATA GAP THIS

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:06.100
IS A. AREA THAT IS NOT- READ

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:08.136
ONLY FLUSHED OUT OF MATH. ARE

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.270
IT'S CLEAR IMPORTANT AS MANY OF

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:10.104
KNOW THE FIRST WATER GET TAKEN

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:12.607
OF THE BASIN IS IF IT'S

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:14.409
CONNECTED TO A SERVER WATER PUMP

01:25:14.476 --> 01:25:16.444
THE CREEK IN STRONG. THAT'S VERY

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:18.780
FOR BROWN ONE ECOSYSTEMS AND

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:22.116
AQUATIC- SPECIES SO- METHODOLOGY

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.252
IS BEING DEVELOPED AND I'M BURKE

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:27.322
AGENCIES JEWS ARE PROXIES OR

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.990
GROUNDWATER LEVELS AS A PROXY.

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.625
ENTERING THINGS DATA GAPS ARE

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:33.294
FILLED WHICH- IS ALLOWABLE BUT

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:34.496
WE WANT SPECIFIC MINIMUM

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:37.265
THRESHOLD BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:38.366
FOR DEPLETION OF INTERCONNECTED.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:40.568
SURFACE WATER AND LASTLY A

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.937
NUMBER OF PLANS HAD- LACK OF

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.706
COORDINATION THEY HAD MULTIPLE

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:46.875
PLANS WITHIN THE BASIN WHICH IS

01:25:46.941 --> 01:25:48.810
A LOT. BUT PROVIDED THEY NEED TO

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.311
HAVE THE SAME DATA AND SAME

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:52.614
METHODOLOGY AND WE FOUND THAT-

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.117
THEY DID NOT SO THOSE ARE. OUR

01:25:56.184 --> 01:26:01.623
COMMUNICATIONS ARE ARE.

01:26:01.689 --> 01:26:02.957
CONTINUING- OTHER AREAS OF THE-

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.025
IN THE THESE ARE THE MAIN ERROR

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:06.227
THAT WOULD DESTROY THAT LED TO

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:08.096
INCOMPLETE- BUT WE FOUND FOR ALL

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:09.631
THE PLANS WE WANTED A BROADER

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:11.799
SET OF CONTINGENCY FOR PROJECTS

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:15.069
FOR THE FUTURE- WE WANTED OUR-

01:26:15.136 --> 01:26:16.905
CONTINUED GREATER TRANSPARENCY

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:19.541
ON THAT PROCESS WITH THE PUBLIC-

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:20.975
MORE DETAILS ON HOW THEY INTEND

BOARD CAN DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:35.950
AN INTERIM PLAN AND THE LOCAL

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:38.385
AGENCIES HAVE TIME TO WORK ON

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:40.354
FIXING THOSE ISSUES THAT. BUT

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.790
THE BASE ON PROBATION. THE WHOLE

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.291
TIME WILL BE CLOSELY

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.693
COORDINATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.294
OF WATER RESOURCES SINCE THE

01:37:47.361 --> 01:37:49.396
GOAL IS FOR BASS AND STICK IT

01:37:49.463 --> 01:37:51.398

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:56.003
EXCITED PLEASE. SO NOW THAT

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.205
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW. WE'VE

01:37:58.272 --> 01:37:59.540
MOVED TOWARDS A PROBATIONARY

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:02.643
DETERMINATION IF IT IS WARRANTED

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:03.877
I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:06.080
WHAT IT MEANS FOR BASS AND TO BE

01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:09.250
ON PROBATION. THE FIRST THING IS

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:12.019
THAT THE BOARD. AFTER THE

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:13.587
DETERMINATION WOULD IDENTIFY THE

01:38:13.654 --> 01:38:15.256
DEFICIENCIES THAT RESULTED IN

01:38:15.322 --> 01:38:16.991
THE BASIN BEING PUT ON PROBATION

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:18.392
AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF LOCAL

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:20.594
AGENCIES AS THEY WORK TO FIX

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:22.129
THOSE ISSUES. SINCE THE BOARD

01:38:22.196 --> 01:38:23.497
HAS TO WAIT AT LEAST ONE YEAR

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:24.732
BEFORE DEVELOPING AND

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.133
IMPLEMENTING AN INTERIM PLAN

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.636
THIS PROVIDES TIME FOR AGENCIES

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:29.670
TO WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:33.540
DEFICIENCIES. IN CASE THE BOARD

01:38:33.607 --> 01:38:35.809
NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN PLAN-

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:37.344
AN INTERIM PLAN THE BOARD NEEDS

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.646
TO COLLECT DATA AND INFORMATION

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:40.414
SO THAT IT'S ABLE TO DO SO AS

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:42.182
SUCH THE BOARD WILL REQUIRE

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.151

BOARD MAY REQUIRE METERS. AND

01:38:53.193 --> 01:38:54.595
THE STATUTE REQUIRES THE BOARD

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:55.596
TO RECOVER THE COST OF THE

01:38:55.663 --> 01:38:58.365
PROGRAM AND SO ANYONE WHO IS

01:38:58.432 --> 01:38:59.500

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.650
CONDUCTING GROUNDWATER

01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.686
ADJUDICATIONS ARE COGNIZANT OF

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.221
THE FACT THAT IT'S A BASIN IS

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:09.323
SOMETHING IS SUBJECT TO STIGMA

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.524
IS A HIGH OR MEDIUM PRIORITY

01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:12.493
BASIN SUBJECT TO CIGNA THE DATA

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:14.161
JUDICATA IS NOT SUPPOSED TO

01:42:14.228 --> 01:42:15.496
INTERFERE WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:17.231
OF THE SUSTAINABILITY CALL

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:18.332
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE BOTTOM

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:20.467
LINE. AND IT DOES NOT IN VARIOUS

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:22.202
WAYS THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS

01:42:22.269 --> 01:42:23.270
NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT WATER

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:24.671
RESOURCES GROUNDWATER

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.874
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY- THE

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.108
DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES

01:42:28.175 --> 01:42:30.911
REFUSE ANY FINAL ADJUDICATION

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:32.613
THE COURT CAN ASK THE STATE

01:42:32.679 --> 01:42:34.181
WATER BOARD IN VARIOUS WAYS TO

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.716
ASSIST IT EITHER IT COULD

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.017
REFERENCE SOMETHING OVER TO THE

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.919
STATE WATER BOARD OR IT CAN ASK

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.921
FOR ASSISTANCE. FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.556
I'M BRINGING EXPERTISE TO THE

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:49.229
EDUCATION. SO THE COURT CAN ALL

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:50.597
. IMPLEMENTED A STAY PLATE.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:52.866
JUDGMENT SO OAK IS ABLE. SORT OF

01:42:52.933 --> 01:42:54.067
SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THE

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:56.803
BOARD PERHAPS IN IMPLEMENTING AN

01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:58.672
INTERN PLAN. MIGHT TO RESTRICT

01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.974
SMOKING THE COURT IS ABLE TO

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:03.410
PREVENT ANY NEW- WELLS OR

01:43:03.477 --> 01:43:05.012
CAMPING OR TO LIMIT EXISTING

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:06.513
WELLS AND PUMPING. SO THERE'S

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.081
REMEDIES WITHIN THAT STREAMLINED

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.384
EDUCATION STATUTE FOR THE COURT.

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:12.286
TO LIMIT PUMPING AND AS I SAID

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:13.954
THERE'S VARIOUS CROSSOVERS

01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:15.622
BETWEEN THE COURT PROCESS AND

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:17.925
THE SIGNAL PROCESS. SO I KNOW

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.693
THAT WAS KIND OF A BRIEF THE FLY

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:23.096
OVER BUT WITHOUT I'LL LEAVE IT

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:24.197
FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:25.832
HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH

HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUE OF OURS

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:23.890
GREW ABOUT WHO IS A SENIOR

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:27.060
FELLOW. AT PPA C. AND WHAT WE'RE

GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ARE.

01:44:29.863 --> 01:44:33.033
THE SOME OF THE BASES THAT ARE

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.101
ON THAT LIST OF INCOMPLETE. THAT

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.769
YOU HEARD ABOUT FROM. THE

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:37.571
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN THIS IS

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:40.240
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON. ISSUES

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:42.476
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHICH

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:44.711
ARGUABLY IS. SORT OF THE PLACE

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:48.382
THAT. REALLY MOTIVATED SEGMENT

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:50.484
TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST PLACE

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.985
BECAUSE THIS WAS BACK DURING THE

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:53.720
LAST DROUGHT A LOT OF ISSUES

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:56.690
THERE WITH. LONG TERM OVERDRAFT

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:58.392
BUT THEN REALLY ACCELERATED

01:44:58.458 --> 01:44:59.993
PUMPING LEADING TO ALL KINDS OF

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.962
PROBLEMS SO WHAT I'M GOING TO

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.196
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE FOR YOU IT'S

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:05.298
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:07.267
ON. SOME OF THE BIG ISSUES IN

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.703
TERMS OF WHAT'S THE NATURE OF

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:11.605
THE OVERDRAFT PROBLEM THERE. A

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.440
BIT ON SOME OF THE ON GOING

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:16.376
CHALLENGES. AND SOME. IDEAS FOR

01:45:16.443 --> 01:45:17.544
WHAT THE STATE CAN DO AT THIS

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:18.578
POINT TO REALLY SUPPORT THE

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.614
LOCAL PROCESS SO. WITH THAT I

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:22.449
JUST ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:45:22.516 --> 01:45:23.617
THAT THIS IS WORK THAT'S BEEN.

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:26.119
COLLABORATION OF A LOT OF FOLKS

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:28.522
FROM. ACROSS THE STATE AND MANY

01:45:28.588 --> 01:45:29.990
VALLEY STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:31.858
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN. INVOLVED

01:45:31.925 --> 01:45:33.360
IN IN PROVIDING INPUT ON ON OUR

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:35.462
RESEARCH OVER THE- PAST FIVE

01:45:35.529 --> 01:45:37.297
SEVEN YEARS. SO WITH THAT PLEASE

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:39.933
NEXT SLIDE. SO YOU'VE HEARD ALL

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.768
ABOUT SIGNAL ALREADY WHAT I JUST

01:45:41.835 --> 01:45:43.870
WANTED TO. HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:45.906
HERE IS THAT LAST LITTLE BIT

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:49.009
WHICH IS. THIS IDEA OF YOU KNOW

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.411
ARE WE MOVING FAST ENOUGH AND

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:53.280
SHOULD SET THE PACE BE PICKED UP

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:55.949
AND I THINK. THE KEY ISSUE THERE

01:45:56.016 --> 01:45:57.384
IS THAT SAME AS KIND OF A

01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:58.985
BALANCING ACT IT DOES PROVIDE A

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:01.588
FLEXIBLE TIMELINE. IT DOESN'T

01:46:01.655 --> 01:46:02.589
SAY OVER BREATH TEST AND

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:04.057
TOMORROW. YOU KNOW YOU SUBMIT

01:46:04.124 --> 01:46:06.126
YOUR PLANS THEN GOT TWENTY YEARS

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.794
TO GET TO FULL SUSTAINABILITY

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:09.830
BUT THERE ARE GUARDRAILS. AND

01:46:09.896 --> 01:46:12.065
THIS IS THE KEY THING NOW WHEN

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:14.167
YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT. ADDRESSING

01:46:14.234 --> 01:46:16.236
THE SIGNIFICANT UNREASONABLE

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:18.038
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS THAT YOU

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:19.873
HAVE TWENTY YEARS TO GET THERE

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:20.907
BUT IF YOU'RE CAUSING

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:22.943
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS ALONG THE

01:46:23.009 --> 01:46:24.111
WAY. YOU'VE GOT TO ADDRESS

01:46:24.177 --> 01:46:25.679
THOSE. IMMEDIATELY YOU CAN'T

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:26.813
WAIT TWENTY YEARS TO ADDRESS

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.515
THOSE SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF

01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:29.916
A KEY THING AND WHAT YOU SAW

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:31.852
FROM THE W. OURS REVIEW. AND

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:33.053
IT'S GOING TO BE I'M SURE A KEY

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.322
ISSUE FOR THE STATE BOARD TOO.

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.524
SO NEXT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

01:46:37.591 --> 01:46:39.392
THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A-

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.528
KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU OF.

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.396
THE ISSUES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:46.333
VALLEY. WHICH ARE KIND OF CIRCLE

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:48.368
THERE WITH THAT. WHITE WHITE

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:52.472
OBLONG- AREA YOU CAN SEE MOST OF

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:54.107
THAT REGION IS COLORED ORANGE

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:55.408
THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE OF THE

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:57.010
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN SO

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:59.446
MOST OF THESE BASINS DID HAVE TO

01:46:59.513 --> 01:47:01.982
SUBMIT PLANS BY. JANUARY OF

01:47:02.048 --> 01:47:04.718
TWENTY TWENTY. IN ALL THERE WERE

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:06.486
ELEVEN THAT WERE SUBMITTED OR

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:07.387
ELEVEN BASINS THAT HAD TO SUBMIT

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:11.525
PLANS- THIS WAS. IT THIS IS A

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:13.193
BIG DEAL THIS IS THE OF THE

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:13.994
STATE'S BIGGEST AGRICULTURAL

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.629
REGION OVER HALF OF ALL

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:16.463
AGRICULTURE OUTPUT MISSION

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:19.900
DOLLARS. COMES FROM THIS REGION-

01:47:19.966 --> 01:47:22.135
AND IT'S A IT'S A BIG OVERDRAFT

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:24.070
IT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:26.706
WE ESTIMATE OF ANNUAL AVERAGE

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:28.675
OVERDRAFT WHICH IS ABOUT 11% OF.

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:31.044
OF NET WATER USE ON AVERAGE MOST

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:34.080
OF THIS IS AGRICULTURE ABOUT 90%

01:47:34.147 --> 01:47:35.549
IS AGRICULTURE BECAUSE OF THE

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:37.250
REALLY BIG IMPORTANCE OF YOUR

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:38.218
GATED AGRICULTURE IN THIS

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.787
REGION. SO CONSEQUENCES THAT WE

01:47:40.854 --> 01:47:43.056
SAW BIG TIME IN THE LAST ROW AND

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:44.124
WE'RE SEEING AGAIN IN THIS

01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:46.393
DROUGHT. DRY WELLS THIS INCLUDES

01:47:46.459 --> 01:47:47.694
A LOT OF DRINKING WATER WELLS

01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:49.496
DOMESTIC WELL SMALL COMMUNITY

01:47:49.563 --> 01:47:51.731
WELLS BUT ALSO ACT WELLS-

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.333
SINKING LANDS YOU HEARD ABOUT

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.335
SUBSIDENCE. IT'S BEEN A LONG

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:57.270
TERM ISSUE BUT IT IT GETS WORSE

01:47:57.337 --> 01:47:58.438
WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF PUMPING.

01:47:58.505 --> 01:47:59.873
AND THAT THAT CELEBRATES DURING

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:02.676
TRIPS. AND THEN JUST THREATS TO

01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.177
THE LONG TERM AVAILABILITY OF

01:48:04.244 --> 01:48:05.545
THAT A REALLY IMPORTANT DROUGHT

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:06.913
RESOURCE WHICH IS THE GROUND

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.114
WATER RESERVES GROUNDWATER

01:48:08.181 --> 01:48:09.716
RESERVES. THAT THAT PEOPLE USE

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:11.218
WHEN THERE ISN'T SURFACE WATER

01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:13.920
AVAILABLE SO. DEALING WITH THIS

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.589
AND KIND OF SOLVING IS SOLVING

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:17.424
THIS PROBLEM IS. A COMBINATION

01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.859
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT

01:48:18.925 --> 01:48:20.493
THREE PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE THE

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:21.494
FIRST IS THE GROUNDWATER MATH

01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:23.230
PROBLEM AND THAT IS THAT IF

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:24.731
YOU'VE GOT LONG TERM OVERDRAFT.

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:26.800
YOU GOT IT FIXED THE BALANCE BY

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:29.302
EITHER ADDING SUPPLIES. REDUCING

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.204
PUMPING REDUCING DEMAND OR SOME

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:34.708
COMBINATION. AND THEN THE COMES

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:36.009
THE SOCIO ECONOMIC PROBLEM WHICH

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:38.211
IS THAT. SOME SOLUTIONS ARE MORE

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:39.613
COSTLY THAN OTHERS AND YOU

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.081
REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHICH

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.749
COMBINATION WHICH PORTFOLIO OF

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.885
SUPPLY AND DEMAND SOLUTIONS. IS

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.620
GOING TO BE THE MOST COST

01:48:46.686 --> 01:48:48.288
EFFECTIVE FOR THE REGION AND

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:49.923
THIS IS THINKING ABOUT THE

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.124
GROWERS THEMSELVES AND THEIR

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.926
BOTTOM LINE BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:54.527
THE JOBS THAT THAT AGRICULTURE

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.062
GENERATES AND SORT OF THE

01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:58.565
OVERALL PACKAGE FOR THE FOR THE

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.500
ECONOMY. SO WE DID AN ANALYSIS

01:49:00.567 --> 01:49:02.168
ON THIS AND WE FOUND THAT

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:05.438
BASICALLY FOR THIS REGION AS A

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:08.041
WHOLE- ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:09.809
THE DEFICIT IS GOING TO BE NEEDS

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:11.044
MET BE MET THROUGH DEMAND

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:12.812
MANAGEMENT. WHICH BASICALLY

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:15.015
MEANS TAKING. TAKING LAND OUT OF

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:16.816
PRODUCTION AND THAT'S A BIG THE

01:49:16.883 --> 01:49:18.885
HARD THING AND THAT'S- PART OF

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:19.719
THE REASON YOU'RE SEEING

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:22.555
CHALLENGES IN. IN SOME OF THE

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:23.990
IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PLANS SO

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:26.693
FAR. THE THIRD ISSUE A THIRD

01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.361
PROBLEM. AND THAT KIND OF

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.030
RELATES TO ALL OF THIS AND HOW

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:31.131
YOU PUT TOGETHER IS THE

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:32.198
GOVERNANCE CHALLENGE. THESE ARE

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:33.967
BIG BASS SINCE THEY'RE NOT TINY

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:36.336
BASINS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.271
DIVERSITY. IN THE CONDITIONS

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:41.207
THERE AND THAT REALLY MAKES.

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:42.909
PUTTING THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.511
HARD AND I WANT TO SAY THAT

01:49:44.577 --> 01:49:46.079
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REALLY

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:48.081
GREAT WORK DONE. TO IT TO TRY TO

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:49.516
TRY TO PULL THIS TOGETHER SO

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.051
WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SUBMITTED INTO

01:49:51.117 --> 01:49:54.020
JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. WAS

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:56.389
ALREADY. YOU KNOW A MAJOR

01:49:56.456 --> 01:49:58.258
ACHIEVEMENT RELATIVE TO WHERE WE

01:49:58.325 --> 01:49:59.592
WERE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.494
THIS LAW WAS PASSED. THAT IS NOT

01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:02.562
TO GIVE PEOPLE A PASS BUT IT'S

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:04.297
JUST TO SAY. IT'S NOT LIKE

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:05.899
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SITTING ON YOU

01:50:05.966 --> 01:50:06.700
KNOW BUT NOT DOING ANYTHING

01:50:06.766 --> 01:50:09.369
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF HARD WORK.

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:10.637
SO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I WANT TO

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:12.439
GIVE YOU JUST THIS MAP WE'RE NOT

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:13.740
GOING TO DRILL INTO IT BUT IT

01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:15.976
JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE. OF THE

01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:18.678
COMPLEXITY OF. MANAGING

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:20.413
ORGANIZING ACCORDING ON WATER IN

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.148
THE SPACES SO THIS IS ALL OF

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:23.383
THE- THE BASINS ON THE SAN

01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:27.153
JOAQUIN VALLEY FLOOR. AND THE-

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.289
THE ONE FOR THIS TO YOUR- I

01:50:29.356 --> 01:50:31.424
NEVER GET RIGHT AND LEFT RIGHT

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:32.225
THE ONE THIS IS IRRIGATED

01:50:32.292 --> 01:50:34.995
CROPLAND. ON TOP THERE THAT'S

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:35.996
GOT ALL THOSE COLORS THOSE

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:38.531
DIFFERENT COLORS ARE. HOW MUCH

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:39.899
AVERAGE HOW MUCH ON AVERAGE OR

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.868
SURFACE WATER AVAILABLE FOR.

01:50:41.935 --> 01:50:43.737
IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE. IF IT'S

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:46.072
QUITE BLUE THAT MEANS THERE'S

01:50:46.139 --> 01:50:46.840
GENERALLY ENOUGH THAT YOU DON'T

01:50:46.906 --> 01:50:48.641
YOU GROUND WATER. IF IT'S DARK

01:50:48.708 --> 01:50:50.276
RED IT MEANS YOU'RE ALWAYS USING

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:51.211
GROUND WATER AND THAT'S ALL

01:50:51.277 --> 01:50:52.645
YOU'RE USING. AND IF IT'S

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:54.914
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN IT'S CEMEX AND

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:55.949
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SOME YOU KNOW

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:58.084
SOME SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO

01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:59.819
OR MORE GROUND WATER IN DROUGHT

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:02.055
YEARS. AND THE OTHER MAPS TO

01:51:02.122 --> 01:51:03.423
SHOW YOU THE MIX BETWEEN

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:05.592
PERENNIALS AND ANNUALS BUT THE

01:51:05.658 --> 01:51:07.727
KEY ISSUE I THINK THAT. THAT

01:51:07.794 --> 01:51:10.063
THIS HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT. EVEN

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:12.098
WITHIN BASINS WITHIN MOST BASINS

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:14.567
THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY. AND

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.069
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT SEEING

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:18.271
PEOPLE ALL COMING TOGETHER IN

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:19.973
ONE SINGLE AGENCY TO DO THIS

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.041
PLANNING WITHIN THE BASES

01:51:21.107 --> 01:51:23.276
BECAUSE- THEY THEY'RE HAVES AND

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.511
HAVE NOTS AND KIND OF FIGURING

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:26.413
THAT OUT. HAS BEEN HARD FOR THEM

01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:27.781
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS JUST

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.816
ACROSS BASINS. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:31.551
DIVERSITY TO AND WATER MOVES

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:33.753
AROUND. AND SO THERE'S POTENTIAL

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.288
THERE FOR THINKING ABOUT ABOUT

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:37.557
THIS NOT JUST AS A BASE AND- BUT

01:51:37.624 --> 01:51:40.226
AS A REGION OKAY NEXT NEXT I

01:51:40.293 --> 01:51:42.796
PLEASE- THIS ONE I DON'T I'M NOT

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:44.330
GOING TO GO INTO THE DETAILS OF

01:51:44.397 --> 01:51:45.999
THIS BUT- IT'S JUST A WAY TO

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:49.536
GIVE YOU A VISUAL. ON ON THE-

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.771
SORRY. SPEAKING THROUGH A MASK

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:56.042
IS IT IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I'M

01:51:56.109 --> 01:52:02.482
NOT USED TO IT- WHAT WHAT. WHAT

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.050
WHAT WHAT THIS SHOWS YOU IS A

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:05.351
SUMMARY OF SOME OF THE ECONOMIC

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:06.920
ANALYSIS THAT WE DID ON THIS

01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:08.822
QUESTION OF SORT OF RECONCILING

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:10.323
GROUNDWATER MATH AND SO ON THE

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.724
SOCIOECONOMIC PROBLEM THIS IS

01:52:11.791 --> 01:52:14.127
WORK LED BY BY ALL OVER AND A

01:52:14.194 --> 01:52:16.463
COLLEAGUE AT UC MERCED A

01:52:16.529 --> 01:52:17.897
PROFESSOR WHO'S WITH WHO'S IT

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.699
BECAUSE WAY MEDINA SWARA AND

01:52:19.766 --> 01:52:21.701
WHAT WHAT THIS LOOKS THAT IS

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:23.470
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR MANAGING

01:52:23.536 --> 01:52:26.639
DEMAND AND SUPPLY AND WHAT IT

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:28.508
BASICALLY SHOWS YOU IS YOU'VE

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.076
GOT CROP REVENUES YOU'VE GOT

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:32.112
LOCAL REGIONAL FARM GDP FARM

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:33.847
RELATED GDP THAT BECAUSE ALL THE

01:52:33.913 --> 01:52:36.082
PROCESSING. DOWNSTREAMOF

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:38.218
AGRICULTURE AS WELL FARM RELATED

01:52:38.284 --> 01:52:40.053
JOBS AGAIN DEALT WITH INCLUDING

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:42.222
OF ON FARM IN DOWNSTREAM AND

01:52:42.288 --> 01:52:43.490
THEN LAND FOLLOWING AND THE

01:52:43.556 --> 01:52:45.959
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS LOOK AT OKAY

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:48.628
HOW CAN YOU MANAGE THIS DEMAND

01:52:48.695 --> 01:52:51.030
IN WAYS THAT ARE MORE OR LESS

01:52:51.097 --> 01:52:52.799
COSTLY FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMY

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:55.301
AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS BASICALLY

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:56.769
THOSE HIGH BAR THE HIGHEST BARS

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:58.972
OF THE BROWN THOSE ARE IF

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:00.607
EVERYTHING IS DONE IN A REALLY

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:01.508
INFLEXIBLE WAY WHERE EVERYBODY'S

01:53:01.574 --> 01:53:03.810
JUST TOLD. YOU ALL CUT THE SAME

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:05.945
PERCENTAGE AND NO MATTER WHAT

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:06.846
CROPS YOU'RE GROWING WHETHER

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:08.781
IT'S HIGH VALUE OR LOW VALUE ALL

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:11.050
OF THOSE THINGS THE ORANGE AND

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:14.254
THE YELLOW ALLOW MORE TRADING

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.054
WATER BOOKS GROUNDWATER AND

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:17.257
SURFACE WATER WITHIN THE BASIN

01:53:17.323 --> 01:53:18.525
AND THEN THE YELLOW IS EVEN

01:53:18.591 --> 01:53:19.959
WITHIN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY

01:53:20.026 --> 01:53:21.594
MORE PROBABLY NOT GROUNDWATER

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:23.163
BUT SURFACE WATER MOVING AROUND.

01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:25.064
THE LAST ONE THE GREEN IS IF YOU

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:27.467
ALSO ADD IN THE COST EFFECTIVE

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.603
SUPPLIES THAT WE ESTIMATE OUR

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:32.672
EARTH ARE WORTH ARE OF A VALUE

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:34.541
THAT FARMERS WILL BE WILLING TO

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:36.176
PAY FOR AND STILL MAKE IT WORTH

01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:36.976
THEIR WHILE TERMS THEIR CROP

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:38.745
BUSINESS THAT'S ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:43.983
ABOUT. HALF A MILLION HALF A

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:44.784
MILLION ACRE FEET. WHAT YOU SEE

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.219
THAT THE- WE DOWN WITH THESE

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:47.187
COMBINATION OF SOLUTIONS AND SO

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:48.254
THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.389
IMPORTANT THING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:51.558
COOPERATE. AND MANAGE DEMAND IN

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.660
WAYS THAT ARE FLEXIBLE- AND THAT

01:53:53.726 --> 01:53:56.229
INCLUDES HAVING ALLOCATIONS AND

01:53:56.296 --> 01:53:58.331
AN ABILITY TO TRADE WATER. SO

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:00.833
LET'S GO AHEAD. TO THE NEXT

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:03.403
SLIDE PLEASE SO W. OURS REVIEWS

01:54:03.469 --> 01:54:05.004
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:06.372
BUT JUST YOU KNOW I WANT TO

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:07.874
APPLAUD THEM THAT THEY TOOK A

01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:09.809
BASIN LEVEL. PERSPECTIVE ON THIS

01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:11.044
RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT EACH

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:13.780
INDIVIDUAL PLAN- INDIVIDUALLY

01:54:13.846 --> 01:54:15.048
THEY REALLY TRIED TO LOOK AT

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:16.883
THE- AT THE HOLD COORDINATOR

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:19.319
HOLE THEY EMPHASIZE THINGS THAT

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:21.521
A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND HAD

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:22.655
POINTED OUT IN THEIR REVIEWS

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.891
ABOUT THE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS.

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:26.459
LIKE IMPACTS ON DRINKING WATER

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:28.161
IMPACTS ON SUBSIDENCE AND THE

01:54:28.228 --> 01:54:29.462
OTHERS THAT PAUL MENTIONED TO

01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:31.331
YOU. AND THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:54:31.397 --> 01:54:31.831
IMPORTANT THAT'S THOSE

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:34.133
GUARDRAILS. THAT ARE REALLY

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.070
IMPORTANT FOR SIGMA TO WORK IN

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:38.137
THE MEANTIME NOT JUST IN TWENTY

01:54:38.204 --> 01:54:40.006
FORTY. AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.307
ALSO HIGHLIGHTED ISSUES AROUND

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.809
COORDINATION CHALLENGES MAY ALSO

01:54:42.875 --> 01:54:44.377
HOW TO HIGHLIGHT ISSUES OR ON

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:46.779
SOME PLANS. NOT REALLY

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:48.248
ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.482
MANAGEMENT OPTIONS THAT COULD

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:52.852
GET TO SUSTAINABILITY SO NEXT

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:56.689
SLIDE. PLEASE AS THE WEED WE DID

01:54:56.756 --> 01:54:58.858
A DETAILED REVIEW OF THE PLANS

01:54:58.925 --> 01:55:00.593
FOR SOME THINGS BACK WHEN THEY

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.061
WERE SUBMITTED IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:55:02.128 --> 01:55:03.997
AND OUR OUR WORK KIND OF

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.398
HIGHLIGHTS SOME ADDITIONAL

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:07.734
ISSUES THAT ARE KIND OF WHO IS

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.835
STEPPING BACK FROM INDIVIDUAL

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:10.637
PLANS A LOOKING AT THE REGION

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:12.939
AND HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER AND

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.941
WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND WERE UP A

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.509
COUPLE OF THINGS WHERE THE PLANS

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:18.978
WERE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC A NUMBER

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:21.414
OF THEM. DO THEIR GROUNDWATER

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.516
MATH AND THEIR ESTIMATE THEIR

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:25.585
OVERDRAFT BUT THEY USE YEARS.

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:26.953
THAT DON'T REALLY GIVE YOU

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:29.522
ENOUGH DRY YEARS. IN IN YOUR

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:30.890
HISTORICAL AVERAGE SO THERE IF

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:32.225
IT COULD SAY THAT THERE THE

01:55:32.292 --> 01:55:33.826
BALANCES THAT THEY SAY THEY NEED

01:55:33.893 --> 01:55:36.529
TO. TO FIX OUR LOW COMPARED TO

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.698
COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE

01:55:38.765 --> 01:55:40.700
LAST DROUGHT. THE SECOND THING

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.402
IS THAT IF YOU ADD UP ALL OF THE

01:55:42.468 --> 01:55:45.405
SUPPLY OPTIONS. THAT THE PLANS

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.573
PROPOSED. YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:48.675
TIMES MORE WATER THAN IS

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:51.444
AVAILABLE PEOPLE ARE MAKE ANY

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:52.512
INDIVIDUAL PROJECT MIGHT BE

01:55:52.578 --> 01:55:55.214
FIN. BUT WHEN YOU ADD THEM UP

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:56.749
FOLKS ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.818
DROP THE WATER. AND THAT'S

01:55:58.885 --> 01:55:59.786
BECAUSE THESE PLANS ARE MADE

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.354
LOCALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:02.689
NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THEIR

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.823
NEIGHBOR IN THE OTHER PLANNING

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.758
AREA TO SEE- THAT THEY WANT THAT

01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:07.327
WATER TOO. SO THERE'S A REAL

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:09.462
CHALLENGE THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:10.863
ALL WORK OUT FOR FOLKS IN TERMS

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:13.333
OF. YOUR ON THE KINGS RIVER FOR

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:14.567
EXAMPLE EVERYBODY WANTS THE SAME

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.336
WATER MULTIPLE TIMES. HEY YOU

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.404
ARE THIS UP YOU WE ESTIMATE FOR

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:20.039
RECHARGE WHAT REACH GROUNDWATER

01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:21.607
RECHARGE IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:24.977
SOLUTION WE ESTIMATE THOUGH THAT

01:56:25.044 --> 01:56:25.945
THERE'S PROBABLY TWO TO THREE

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:27.213
TIMES MORE. DESIRE FOR RECHARGE

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:28.648
AND THERE IS WATER FOR RECHARGE

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:31.317
AND SPACE AND- SO ON THE FLIP

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:33.786
SIDE OF THIS GETS TO THE KIND OF

01:56:33.853 --> 01:56:35.121
TOO LITTLE EMPHASIS IS ON

01:56:35.188 --> 01:56:37.423
MANAGING DEMAND. WE'RE IN

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:38.725
UNDERSTANDABLY THE PLANTS

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:39.992
HAVEN'T WANTED TO GO HARD ON

01:56:40.059 --> 01:56:42.495
THAT IN THE BEGINNING BUT THAT'S

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:43.162
WHERE THEY'RE GOOD THEY'RE GOING

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:45.164
TO NEED TO GO MORE AND QUICKER

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:47.166
AND- THIS YOU KNOW THE LAST

01:56:47.233 --> 01:56:49.102
POINT IS ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THAT

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.837
IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE DRIER AND

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:53.005
HOTTER THAN. THAN THE HISTORICAL

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:54.841
AVERAGES WHICH IS WHAT THE PLANS

01:56:54.907 --> 01:56:59.479
FOCUSED ON SO WITH THAT I GUESS-

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.347
WE WILL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE AND

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:03.750
- JUST. SOME COULD EMPHASIZE FOR

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:04.984
YOU YOU KNOW WE'RE BACK IN

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:07.820
DROUGHT- THIS MEANS. FEWER

01:57:07.887 --> 01:57:09.789
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RECHARGE WHICH

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:11.424
IS THE SUPPLY SIDE. FULLER

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:12.825
PUMPING MORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:14.527
HAVE SURFACE WATER AND THAT'S

01:57:14.594 --> 01:57:15.361
LEADING TO MORE THESE

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.029
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS SO IT'S

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:18.264
REALLY PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.032
THAT ON THOSE GUARD RAILS THIS

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.701
IS SOME ESTIMATES THE AUBURN

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.703
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE DR RICH PALU.

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.304
DID ON WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO

01:57:25.371 --> 01:57:27.974
GO DRY IF THIS COMING YEARS IS

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.643
ALSO DRY AND VISITED A DOMESTIC

01:57:30.710 --> 01:57:32.211
WELL SO YOU KNOW IT'S A HUMAN

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:34.414
ISSUE FOR COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.482
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HERE.

01:57:36.549 --> 01:57:38.718
OKAY NEXT SLIDE. FINAL ONE FOR

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:41.721
YOU. FIVE AREAS WHERE WE THINK

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:42.355
THAT THE STATE COULD REALLY BE

01:57:42.422 --> 01:57:45.057
HELPFUL HERE- THE FIRST IS YOU

01:57:45.124 --> 01:57:47.660
KNOW ADDRESSING. REALLY REALLY

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:51.597
ENCOURAGING PUSHING. OF ENTICING

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:54.333
LOCALS TO REALLY ADDRESS THE-

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.735
THE UNDESIRABLE RESULTS OF

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:58.004
OVERDRAFT AND FOR THIS THE KEY

01:57:58.070 --> 01:58:00.840
ACTION IS TO USE THE USE THE

01:58:00.907 --> 01:58:02.208
REGULATORY PROCESS THE WAY IT

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:03.810
WAS WRITTEN INTO THE LAW. AND I

01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:05.878
THINK YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE YOUR

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:07.480
HAS HAS MADE THAT. MADE THAT

01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:08.948
CLEAR NOW IN THEIR REVIEWS AND

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:11.284
THIS IS THIS IS AN AREA WHERE IT

01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:12.018
DOESN'T DO THE GUARDRAILS THAT

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:14.320
NEED TO BE. ADDRESSED THEIR WAYS

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:14.987
IN WHICH THE STATE CAN ALSO

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:17.323
PROVIDE A SUPPORT. FOR AGENCIES

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:18.624
THAT ARE THEY WANT TO REALLY DO

01:58:18.691 --> 01:58:20.660
THIS BUT THIS IS SORT OF THE-

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:22.495
YOU KNOW. THIS THIS IS WHERE YOU

01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:24.363
YOU CAN'T GIVE YOU CAN'T GIVE

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:27.099
THE ENTITIES A PASS ON THIS YOU

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.167
HAVE TO HOLD HOLD THEM

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:30.336
ACCOUNTABLE. THE SECOND ONE IS

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:31.938
PROMOTING ACCELERATION OF DEMAND

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.673
MANAGEMENT. AND THIS IS WHERE I

01:58:33.739 --> 01:58:34.974
WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK THAT THE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.809
SIGMA TIME LINES. NEED TO BE

01:58:36.876 --> 01:58:39.245
SHORTENED. BUT I THINK THAT THIS

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:40.680
MEASURABLE PROGRESS ALONG THE

01:58:40.746 --> 01:58:42.949
WAY AND- DEALING WITH THE

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:44.250
GUARDRAILS OF NOT CAUSING THE

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.285
UNDESIRABLE RESULTS. MEANS THAT

01:58:46.352 --> 01:58:47.687
YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE FASTER ON THE

01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:49.622
DEMAND SIDE. THAN THE THAN FOLKS

01:58:49.689 --> 01:58:51.390
WERE HOPING IT HAD WE BEEN FIVE

01:58:51.457 --> 01:58:53.526
YEARS OF WET RECHARGE YEARS WE

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:54.527
MIGHT HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT

01:58:54.594 --> 01:58:56.662
CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. BUT IT'S

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:59.298
DRY AND SO THE FACT MEANING YOU

01:58:59.365 --> 01:59:00.600
HAVE TO ADOPT AND ACCELERATE

01:59:00.666 --> 01:59:02.568
DEMAND MANAGEMENT. WHERE THE

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:03.369
STATE CAN REALLY HELP PAUL

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.771
MENTIONED- SOME SOME SUPPORT THE

01:59:05.838 --> 01:59:07.406
DEED OF YOURS PROVIDING

01:59:07.473 --> 01:59:09.041
ACCOUNTING TOOLS AT ALL OF THOSE

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.676
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT CAN

01:59:10.743 --> 01:59:12.712
CAN HELP WITH THIS A LOT. THE

01:59:12.778 --> 01:59:15.147
THIRD IS PROMOTING REALISTIC

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:17.116
EFFORTS ON NEW SUPPLIES. AND

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:18.317
THIS IS WHERE YOU KNOW GETTING

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:19.585
SO PEOPLE ARE NOT COUNTING THE

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:21.354
SAME DROPS MULTIPLE TIMES. I

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:23.256
THINK THAT THE STATE OF THE BOTH

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:24.223
THE OF YOU ARE IN THE STATE

01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:26.058
BOARD THEY BOTH BEEN DOING A LOT

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:27.960
TO TRY TO PROMOTE RECHARGE.

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:29.562
THROUGH IN VARIOUS WAYS BUT THIS

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:30.963
IS WHERE JOINT COORDINATED

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:32.164
EFFORTS CENTER PROBABLY

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.599
MENTIONED ARE THERE WAYS TO.

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.301
HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR IN THE STATE

01:59:35.368 --> 01:59:39.338
BOARD COORDINATE. MORE THIS IS

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:40.840
THIS IS ONE OF THE- RELIEF THAT

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:42.375
DETERMINE OF- TO HELP REALLY

01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:44.310
ENCOURAGE COORDINATION AMONG

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:45.945
PARTIES ON THOSE RECHARGE

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:47.079
EFFORTS RATHER THAN JUST

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:49.081
FIGHTING OVER THE SCRAPS AND

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.383
FACILITATING PERMITTING WHICH IS

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:54.787
A BIG ISSUE. FOUR IS- ASSESSING

01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:56.222
WATER THE SMART INFRASTRUCTURE

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:57.557
INVESTMENTS THERE ARE GOING TO

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.292
BE SOME REGIONAL INVESTMENTS NOT

01:59:59.358 --> 02:00:01.093
JUST LOCAL ONES THAT ARE GONNA

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.962
BE IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:03.896
IMPORTANT STATE ROLE TO THINK

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:06.332
ABOUT THAT- AND HELP AND ANALYZE

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:09.101
THAT AND THEN FIFTH IS START.

02:00:09.168 --> 02:00:11.070
HELPING TO PLAN FOR SUCCESSFUL

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.005
FARMLAND TRANSITIONS IN BOTH

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:15.041
CENTER PROBABLY AND I THINK

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:15.575
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DICKINSON

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:18.044
MENTION THIS. IN THEIR REMARKS

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:19.145
THAT YET LANCE GOING TO COME OUT

02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:20.513
OF PRODUCTION OVER TIME WITH

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.814
THIS WE ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST A

02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:22.949
HALF MILLION ACRES IN THIS

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.817
REGION IS GOING TO COME OUT

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:25.918
THAT'S THAT'S THE IF ALL GOES

02:00:25.985 --> 02:00:28.821
WELL- AND THAT'S A LOT OF LAND

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:31.023
THAT'S 1015% THAT'S GOOD THAT

02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:31.991
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:34.093
COMING OUT. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:38.264
THAT DONE IN THE HAPHAZARD WAY-

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:39.231
THEY WANT TO SEE IT DONE IN WAYS

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:40.700
THAT. YOU DON'T DON'T CAUSE HARM

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:41.834
TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO PUBLIC

02:00:41.901 --> 02:00:44.637
HEALTH WITH DUST- AND THAT.

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.238
BRING AS MUCH REVENUE AS

02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:47.506
POSSIBLE AND SO THEIR

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:49.141
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VALLEY FOR

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:51.210
THE SOLAR IS ONE OF THEM. WHICH

02:00:51.277 --> 02:00:52.578
REALLY ALIGNS WITH STATE CLEAN

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:54.347
ENERGY GOALS- BUT THERE ARE

02:00:54.413 --> 02:00:56.248
OTHERS IN TERMS OF HABITAT TO

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.117
THIRTY BY THIRTY- THAT THAT

02:00:58.184 --> 02:01:00.019
CENTER PROBABLY MENTIONED. THERE

02:01:00.086 --> 02:01:02.088
MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:03.255
YOU KNOW DRYLAND CROPPING AS

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:05.491
WELL IN SOME CASES. PLANNING IS

02:01:05.558 --> 02:01:06.926
GOING TO BE KEY FOR THIS AND

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.361
THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOT TO BE LED

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.695
LOCALLY BUT THE STATE CAN REALLY

02:01:09.762 --> 02:01:11.530
PROVIDE IMPORTANT SUPPORT. THE

02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:13.399
NEW DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION

02:01:13.466 --> 02:01:16.469
FARMLANDS YOUR REPURPOSE SAYING-

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.571
SUPPORT IS A GOOD START TO START

02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:19.872
THERE BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:22.241
THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:23.743
THIS. AND WITH THAT I WILL. STOP

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.612
AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:01:26.679 --> 02:01:27.613
FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THIS

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.582
PRESENTATION- QUESTIONS FROM THE

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:35.388
COMMITTEE. SALLY. SO IN ALL THE

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:36.756
DATA ANALYSIS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:01:36.822 --> 02:01:40.126
DONE IN REGARDS TO- IN CAPTURING

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:43.396
THOSE WATERS- BABY BEING. IS

02:01:43.462 --> 02:01:45.564
THERE ANY TALK OR I GUESS

02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:47.099
CONSIDERATION ABOUT THE WATER

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:50.436
STORAGE SO IF WE HAD. THE

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.004
PROPOSED WATER STORAGE THAT WERE

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.906
IT WAS IN THE WATER BOND BUILT

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:56.609
AND WE STORING THOSE. GALLONS

02:01:56.676 --> 02:01:58.544
RIGHT NOW DURING THE WHAT YEARS

02:01:58.611 --> 02:01:59.979
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THE

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:02.114
REST OF THE STATE AND THE FARMER

02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:03.849
SPECIFICALLY I MEAN YOU TALK

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:04.984
ABOUT HALF A MILLION ACRES

02:02:05.051 --> 02:02:06.485
COMING OUT OF PRODUCTION I'M

02:02:06.552 --> 02:02:08.154
SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:09.655
RIGHT NOW LISTING THAT ARE.

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.724
HAVING SOME IN A MAJOR ANXIETY

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:13.659
OVER THAT SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:15.361
THAT AT ALL. SHOP ASSISTANT THE

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.629
A MAYBE OVER WILL ALSO WANT TO

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:21.333
CHIME IN- SO- IN IN THIS REGION.

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.768
AND WE LOOK WE LOOK AND I WAS

02:02:22.835 --> 02:02:24.203
SAY WHENI SAY WE ARE ALL OF OUR

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.671
SPECIALLY LOOKED AT ALL OF THE

02:02:25.738 --> 02:02:27.006
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS AND WHAT

02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:28.107
THAT WOULD BRING INTO THE INTO

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:30.676
THE VALLEY. YOUR TEMPERANCE FLAT

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:32.244
WAS ONE. WHAT LOCAL RESERVOIR

02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:34.213
THAT A LOT OF FOLKS HAD HOPES

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.515
FOR. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE WATER

02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:39.518
AND IT IN THE END. THE IT WHAT

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:40.853
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO FARMERS IN

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:43.689
THE IN THE VALLEY TO. PROVIDE

02:02:43.756 --> 02:02:46.092
THE CARSHARE FOR THAT- SO THERE

02:02:46.158 --> 02:02:48.227
ARE SOME. SOME FOLKS IN THE

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:49.829
VALLEY WHO ARE ARE THINKING

02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:51.297
ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME

02:02:51.363 --> 02:02:52.998
INVESTMENT SHARES INSIGHTS AND

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:54.100
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT ST

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:56.001
LOUIS EXPANSION THING SO THAT.

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:57.770
THERE MAY BE SOME SURFACE WATER

02:02:57.837 --> 02:02:59.572
EXPANSIONS THAT. COULD BE

02:02:59.638 --> 02:03:01.407
HELPFUL BUT THE BUT THE BIG

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.675
PLAYS IN THE VALLEY ARE REALLY

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.077
AROUND. THE SMART ECONOMIC PLAYS

02:03:05.144 --> 02:03:07.079
AROUND RECHARGE ABOUT STORAGE TO

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:09.181
AND THERE'S REALLY SOPHISTICATED

02:03:09.248 --> 02:03:11.183
GROUNDWATER STORAGE. ALREADY

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:12.718
TAKING PLACE IN THIS REGION FROM

02:03:12.785 --> 02:03:13.853
YOU KNOW PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS

02:03:13.919 --> 02:03:15.988
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO THE

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:17.256
KEY IS KIND OF MAKING MORE OF

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.958
THAT HAPPENED AND OVER MAYBE YOU

02:03:19.024 --> 02:03:20.659
WANNA. ADD ON YOU KNOW SORT OF

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:23.162
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE HELPED THIS

02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:25.097
YEAR IF WE ALREADY GOT MORE.

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:26.599
THANKS BUT QUESTION. YES FOR

02:03:26.665 --> 02:03:28.234
SURE THAT YOU KNOW WOULD HELP

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.869
HOPE SOME- IF I REMEMBER

02:03:29.935 --> 02:03:31.303
CORRECTLY I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT

02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:33.739
HOW ABOUT I THINK THAT THE- THE-

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:36.075
YIELD THANK YOUR MIKE. IS ON

02:03:36.142 --> 02:03:37.943
BECAUSE BEACON TIME THANK YOU-

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:40.179
THE DEALFROM THE REST OF US

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:41.447
ABOUT- JUST EMITTED IN THE BLOOD

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:43.649
WAS ALL TWO HUNDRED OR TWO

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:44.784
HUNDRED SEVENTY. THOUSAND ACRE

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:47.286
FEET PER YEAR ON AVERAGE THESE

02:03:47.353 --> 02:03:48.254
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WILL HAVE MUCH

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.321
LESS THAN THAT. JUST FOR

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:51.390
REFERENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:03:51.457 --> 02:03:53.859
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET-

02:03:53.926 --> 02:03:55.995
OFF. NEW POTENTIAL ONE AVAILABLE

02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:57.730
ON WHAT WE ARE ESTIMATING IS

02:03:57.797 --> 02:03:59.398
MORE MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT I

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:02.635
COULD FEED. OFF OTHER DRAFT SO

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.603
YES IT COULD HAVE HELPED A

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:07.573
LITTLE. BUT EVEN WITH. SOME OF

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.876
THESE INVESTMENTS- WE ESTIMATED

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:13.512
THAT THE IT'S KIND OF ESSENTIAL

02:04:13.579 --> 02:04:18.851
TO REDUCE SOME- FOREMAN SOME

02:04:18.918 --> 02:04:24.123
PROBLEM. MISTER CAR. THANK YOU.

02:04:24.190 --> 02:04:27.326
AND IS IN REGARDS TO- NUMBER

02:04:27.393 --> 02:04:29.628
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LONG

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:31.697
TERM PLANNING WHAT HAVE YOU AND

02:04:31.764 --> 02:04:33.866
THERE WAS A LITTLE MENTION OF

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:35.167
BUTLAND'S DURING THE COURSE OF

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:37.303
PRESENTATIONS BUT- AND THIS

02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:39.505
QUESTION GO TO MIGRANTS FROM ONE

02:04:39.572 --> 02:04:41.040
ROOM FEELS THEY CAN THEY CAN

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:43.142
THEY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT

02:04:43.209 --> 02:04:46.145
HOW ARE AGENCIES ENSURING THAT

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:48.214
THE STATE'S REMAINING WETLANDS

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:49.114
BUT CONTINUE TO HAVE THE WATER

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:50.416
THEY NEED DURING SIGMA

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.384
IMPLEMENTATION- BECAUSE

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:53.652
SOMETIMES I MEAN OBVIOUSLY IS A

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:55.154
LOT OF ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.822
REGARDING FARMLAND TRANSITION.

02:04:56.889 --> 02:04:59.258
ARE CRITICAL BOOK BUT- THOSE

02:04:59.325 --> 02:05:01.126
WEAPONS OBVIOUSLY ARE INCREDIBLY

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:02.361
SENSITIVE HABITATS WANT TO MAKE

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:05.364
SURE THAT THEY'RE VERY MUCH OF

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:09.335
IMPORTANT PART. OF THE

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:09.935
CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. SO

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:11.070
THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING

02:05:11.136 --> 02:05:13.672
QUESTION IN THIS REGION WHICH IS

02:05:13.739 --> 02:05:14.306
A PRETTY DRY REGION I MEAN ONE

02:05:14.373 --> 02:05:16.909
OF THE REASONS IT'S- IT'S GOT A

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:18.878
BIG OVERLAP PROBLEM IS BECAUSE-

02:05:18.944 --> 02:05:20.546
IT DEPENDS A LOT ON ON SURFACE

02:05:20.613 --> 02:05:22.214
WATER THAT'S- NOT ALWAYS THERE

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:25.317
RIGHT- SO THERE ARE MANAGE

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:27.753
WETLANDS THAT RECEIVE THAT HAVE

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.455
PRETTY SENIOR ALLOCATION SENIOR

02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:31.690
RIGHTS IN A WAY TO IS TO THE

02:05:31.757 --> 02:05:33.859
SURFACE WATER- THAT ARE PART OF

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.694
THIS CENTRAL VALLEY MANAGED.

02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:38.163
WETLANDS COMPLEX AND THERE

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:40.132
THERE'S A LOT OF COOPERATION

02:05:40.199 --> 02:05:42.568
THERE- WITH WITH LOCAL GROWERS

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:46.338
IN SOME PLACES AS PART OF THE

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:49.341
WATER PROJECT PLANNING SO YOU'RE

02:05:49.408 --> 02:05:51.176
SEEING PLACES LIKE CROSSINGS

02:05:51.243 --> 02:05:52.544
WATER DISTRICT THAT IS

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.313
COOPERATING WITH LOCAL ATTIC AND

02:05:54.380 --> 02:05:55.681
THEY'RE FINDING WAYS TO KIND OF

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:57.149
GROW THE PIE THROUGH SOME

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:58.851
THROUGH LOCAL INVESTMENTS. THE

02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:02.421
BIG CHALLENGE FOR- WATER SUPPLY

02:06:02.488 --> 02:06:03.923
FOR THE MANAGE WETLANDS IS THAT

02:06:03.989 --> 02:06:05.691
THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE WETLANDS

02:06:05.758 --> 02:06:08.327
ESPECIALLY THAT ALSO PUMP THAT

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:09.595
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THEY FART

02:06:09.662 --> 02:06:11.630
THEY FARM WETLANDS BY BY PUMPING

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:12.564
GROUNDWATER AND SO THERE'S A

02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:14.600
CONCERN THAT SOME OF THOSE ARE

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:15.968
NOT GOING TO HAVE. YOU IN THE

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:18.470
SAME WAY THAT AG WILL BE CUT IN

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:19.605
SOME PLACES THAT THEY'RE ALSO

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:20.906
GOING TO BE PUT ON A DIET SO

02:06:20.973 --> 02:06:22.474
THERE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT THAT

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:24.009
BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF

02:06:24.076 --> 02:06:25.811
INTEREST RIGHT NOW IN.

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:28.914
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MULTI BENEFIT

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.316
RECHARGE AND THAT'S WHERE A

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:31.784
PLACE LIKE THE KERN WATER BANK

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:34.853
IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF. YOU

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:37.256
CAN HAVE- A WETLAND INTERMITTENT

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:39.024
WETLAND THAT'S RECHARGING

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.993
GROUNDWATER IF YOU STRUCTURE IT

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:42.361
IN A IN THE WAY THAT IT KIND OF

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:43.796
IS AMBLING INTO IT'S A GREAT

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:45.164
PLACE TO VISIT AND YOU'LL SEE

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:45.965
YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S WATER

02:06:46.031 --> 02:06:47.766
THERE. THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT

02:06:47.833 --> 02:06:49.268
KINDS OF WILDLIFE AND SO IT'S A

02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:51.603
REALLY VALUABLE PART OF THE

02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:53.706
ECOSYSTEM AND SO YOU KNOW SOME

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.307
OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:57.810
FUNDING I'M GUESSING IT KINDA

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:59.979
HOPING WILL GO TOWARD PROJECTS

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:01.280
THAT LOOK THAT AIM TO DO THAT

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:03.282
KIND OF MULTI BENEFIT RECHARGE

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:08.754
SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S A NICE USE. OF A FORMER FARMLAND ACTUALLY

02:07:08.821 --> 02:07:10.022
. DID FOLKS FROM THE WATERY. ONE

02:07:10.089 --> 02:07:13.792
AWAY IN THE- SHE- YES AND-

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:15.594
ALANKO COVER THAT VERY WELL BUT

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:17.329
THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WE'RE GOING

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:18.964
TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE

02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:20.799
SPECIALLY THOSE PRIVATE WETLANDS

02:07:20.866 --> 02:07:22.768
THAT ARE REALLY DEPENDENT ON

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.636
GROUNDWATER PUMPING IN AND FOR

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.638
BASINS THAT. ASCETIC

02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:29.174
ALLOCATIONS- YOU KNOW THE

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.476
ALLOCATIONS MAY NOT BE

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:32.745
SUFFICIENT SIMILAR TO TWO OF OUR

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:35.547
CROP- SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THA.

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.549
GOING AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.718
ASPECT FOR BOTH BASINS DURING

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.220
IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.421
POSED THE QUESTION HOW THEY'RE

02:07:42.488 --> 02:07:44.790
ADDRESSING- BUT WHAT USES AND

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:48.060
USERS AND GROUNDED ECOSYSTEMS-

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:49.461
BUT THEY'LL ALSO PROBABLY NEED

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:50.796
TO BE SOME OF THE CREATIVE

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.531
SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:07:52.598 --> 02:07:59.038
DON'T LOSE. MORE OF THE STATE'S-

02:07:59.104 --> 02:07:59.905
WEAPONS SO THIS PROCESS. THANK

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:02.975
YOU. THANK YOU IF I GO IS A

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:05.544
QUICK I HAVE IS I BELIEVE THE

02:08:05.611 --> 02:08:08.113
DOUBLE OR WHAT SICK GO

02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:09.681
CHALLENGES YOU HAVE SEEN

02:08:09.748 --> 02:08:11.984
ESPECIALLY IN THOSE BASINS THAT

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:14.453
HAVE MULTIPLE GSA'S AND THAT ARE

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:22.861
CREATING. THE FULL ARTICLE GSA

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:24.129
IN MULTIPLE GEOGRAPHIES WHICH

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:27.266
IS- ALLOWED FOR IN THE LAW- DOES

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:28.801
CREATE COMPLEXITIES AND ITS

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.536
COMPLEXITIES THAT BOTH LOCAL

02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:33.238
AGENCIES- CHOSE TO TAKE ON TO

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:34.907
THEMSELVES. THEN THEY BASE THEM

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.975
ON THEIR OWN IT DOES REQUIRE

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:38.610
THAT WHEN IT MORE THAN ONE

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:40.779
PLANTS IT IS THE SAME DAY THE

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:43.015
SAME METHODOLOGY SO FROM OUR END

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:47.219
WE WANT TO SEE. THOSE PLANS. IN

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:49.888
THE AGGREGATE SPEAK ON THE BASE

02:08:49.955 --> 02:08:52.658
AND THERE'S A WHOLE- SO DOING

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:54.693
THAT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IF

02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.095
THEY'RE NOT USING THE SAME DATA

02:08:56.161 --> 02:08:57.029
METHODOLOGY WHICH IS

02:08:57.096 --> 02:08:59.164
INCONSISTENT BLOCK SO THAT'S ONE

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:00.599
OF THE DEFICIENCIES ARE WE

02:09:00.666 --> 02:09:04.470
IDENTIFIED BUT- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:05.637
THEY'RE AWESOME. AREAS WHERE

02:09:05.704 --> 02:09:06.972
THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ONE G.

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:08.607
AS INTERFACE AND THEY WORK

02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:13.045
TOGETHER ONE- WHICH IS- ANOTHER

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:15.514
. IN THAT MAKES OUT A LOT LESS

02:09:15.581 --> 02:09:18.117
COMPLEXITY- AND THEN THE BEEN

02:09:18.183 --> 02:09:20.419
SOME BASINS THAT HAVE HAD ONE OF

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:26.458
MY GSA. MORE THAN ONE GST. AND

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:28.894
DID IT IN A WAY THAT WAS. WITH

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:30.395
ALSO DOES RUN THE BEFORE YOU GET

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:32.998
INTO WATER ONE PLAN DOES- SOME.

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:35.901
THAT ARE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:38.537
OVERCOME WE LOOK CLOSELY AT.

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:41.840
THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.709
MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS I HAVE A

02:09:43.775 --> 02:09:47.479
FEW QUESTIONS MYSELF- FIRST PAUL

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:49.281
WELL YOU'RE ON CAN YOU I'M

02:09:49.348 --> 02:09:50.415
THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTED

02:09:50.482 --> 02:09:51.550
PARTIES HERE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:52.651
THE INTERESTS OF THE FARMERS BUT

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:54.653
ALSO THE DOMESTIC WEALTH HOLDERS

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.022
WHO ARE REALLY AFFECTED BY THIS-

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:58.590
INCREASED PUMPING SO COULD WE

02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.224
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.026
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND HOW

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:02.661
THEY HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE AND

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:04.463
WIDE HOW WE CONTINUE TO ENSURE

CONDITIONS IN THOSE BASINS- IT'S

02:12:29.007 --> 02:12:30.142

02:12:30.208 --> 02:12:32.678
POINT- HOW MANY BASINS MAY COME

02:12:32.744 --> 02:12:34.646
IN TO THE BOARD'S JURISDICTION.

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:36.782

RESOLVE ALL THE DEFICIENCIES

02:12:39.318 --> 02:12:40.252

DAYS- WINDOW THAT WERE IN THE

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:58.003
MIDDLE OF NOW. IN THAT CASE THE

02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.504
WATER BOARD WILL BE

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:03.575

DEEPLY ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:52.324
JUSTICE AND CLIMATE CHANGE BUT

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.291

THAT'S IT A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:13:59.364 --> 02:14:02.167
POINT I THINK IT'S TOP OF MIND

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:04.336
FOR EVERYBODY IN THE VALLEY- AND

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:05.871
IT IS DEFINITELY AN IMPORTANT

02:14:05.937 --> 02:14:08.640
LINES FOR US IN IN THE WORK. IN

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:10.742
THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING.

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:14.079
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:14:14.146 --> 02:14:15.680
THINKING ABOUT DEMAND MANAGEMENT

02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:17.749
IN A IN A DOING DEMAND

02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:19.985
MANAGEMENT IN A FLEXIBLE WAY IS

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:21.620
IMPORTANT IF YOU REMEMBER THAT

02:14:21.686 --> 02:14:23.655
SET OF CHARTS YOU KNOW IF THERE

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:26.758
CAN BE WELL MANAGED TRADING. OF

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:28.293
GROUND WATER IN THE BASIN AND

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.529
WELL MANAGED MOVEMENT OF SURFACE

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:32.764
WATER SO THAT THE WATER IS GOING

02:14:32.831 --> 02:14:34.065
TO YOU KNOW THAT THE THINGS THAT

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.467
ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

02:14:35.534 --> 02:14:37.436
GENERATING THEM THE MOST.

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.504
ECONOMY COMFORT FOR THE AREA

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.873
THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR COMMUNITIES

02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:43.041
AS WELL AS FOR THE FARMERS

02:14:43.108 --> 02:14:45.911
BOTTOM LINE- AND SO THAT THAT

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:47.479
HAS TO BE DONE IN A WAY THAT

02:14:47.546 --> 02:14:49.448
ALSO IS MAKING SURE THAT IT'S A

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:50.682
YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE WHAT

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:52.017
DRINKING WATER IN THEIR WELLS

02:14:52.083 --> 02:14:53.852
BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO IF YOU IF

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:55.687
YOU TAKE THAT WIDE LANDS ON IT.

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:58.123

YOU CAN SET UP PROGRAMS THAT DO

02:14:59.024 --> 02:15:02.060
THAT WELL AND- THIS IS YOU KNOW

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:04.429
WHY KIND OF GETTING THE BASICS

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:41.245
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:43.348
YEAR JUST AROUND THE TSA AND

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:44.716
MEET THE MONITORING AND

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:45.249
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF

02:23:45.316 --> 02:23:47.051
STIGMA. THAT NUMBER DOES NOT

02:23:47.118 --> 02:23:48.486
INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:49.988
PROJECTS ARE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS

02:23:50.054 --> 02:23:50.989
NEEDED TO REACH THE SAME

02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:52.657
ABILITY. AND IT DOESN'T REALLY

02:23:52.724 --> 02:23:53.958
INCLUDE THE MONITORING THAT THE

02:23:54.025 --> 02:23:55.326
MEMBER AGENCIES WERE ALREADY

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:58.496
DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:23:58.563 --> 02:24:00.631
GROUNDWATER ELEVATION. THE DSA

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:02.500
IS MEMBER FUNDED- FROM THAT

02:24:02.567 --> 02:24:03.968
MEMBERS OF THE JOINT POWERS

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:05.870
AUTHORITY. AND SO THAT IS A LOT

02:24:05.937 --> 02:24:07.438
OF ADDITIONAL COST TO PUT ON

02:24:07.505 --> 02:24:09.040
PRIMARILY WATER RATEPAYERS

02:24:09.107 --> 02:24:12.343
BECAUSE AND IN THIS SPACE AND WE

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:14.212
DON'T HAVE. REALLY ANY LARGE. AB

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:15.279
IS IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:16.914
AGRICULTURE IT'S REALLY JUST

02:24:16.981 --> 02:24:18.349
DOWN TO URBAN AND RURAL

02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:21.986
RESIDENTIAL- IT'S NOT AN

02:24:22.053 --> 02:24:23.421
AFFLUENT AREA BUT IT'S ALSO NOT

02:24:23.488 --> 02:24:24.756
CONSIDERED TO DISADVANTAGED

02:24:24.822 --> 02:24:26.391
COMMUNITY OTHER PARTS THAT HAVE

02:24:26.457 --> 02:24:27.725
BEEN IN THE PAST THEY WERE IN

02:24:27.792 --> 02:24:30.194
THE MOST RECENT- ITERATION OF

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:31.396
THOSE ITS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITY

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:32.830
MAPS. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

02:24:32.897 --> 02:24:34.565
OUT HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE OUR

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:36.334
COSTS IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:38.503
EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE. IN

02:24:38.569 --> 02:24:39.937
ORDER FOR THIS BASIN AND I'M

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:41.939
SURE MANY OTHERS JUST TO BE ABLE

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:43.875
TO SUPPORT THE GSA ONGOING

02:24:43.941 --> 02:24:45.276
SUPPORT FROM THE STATE NEEDS TO

02:24:45.343 --> 02:24:47.111
BE AVAILABLE. IT DOESN'T ONLY

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:48.379
MEAN DIRECT FUNDS BUT IT COULD

02:24:48.446 --> 02:24:50.181
ALSO MEAN ADDITIONAL GUIDACE

02:24:50.248 --> 02:24:51.449
DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE ON

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:53.718
OPTIONS TO RAISE FUNDING IN

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:55.353
SUPPORT OF SAME MATH- FOR

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:57.522
EXAMPLE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:24:57.588 --> 02:25:00.091
CONFUSION ABOUT- EXACTLY WHAT.

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:02.126
WHAT FEES WERE ALLOWED TO CHARGE

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:04.929
AND HOW WE WOULD USE PROP TO

02:25:04.996 --> 02:25:05.830
EIGHTEEN WHETHER WE CAN GET.

02:25:05.897 --> 02:25:07.165
SOMETHING FEES THINGS LIKE THAT

02:25:07.231 --> 02:25:08.366
SEVEN MORE GUIDANCE WOULD BE

02:25:08.433 --> 02:25:10.668
REALLY REALLY HELPFUL. WHEN

02:25:10.735 --> 02:25:12.170
FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE

02:25:12.236 --> 02:25:13.971
FROM THE STATE IT NEEDS TO BE

02:25:14.038 --> 02:25:15.440
ABLE TO GO TOWARDS OPERATING

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:17.175
EXPENSES LIKE ADMINISTRATION

02:25:17.241 --> 02:25:19.310
MONITORING AND REPORTING AND NOT

02:25:19.377 --> 02:25:21.846
JUST PROJECTS- FINALLY THAT

02:25:21.913 --> 02:25:23.281
SUPPORT SHOULD ALSO BE EASY FOR

02:25:23.347 --> 02:25:25.583
THE TSA'S ACCESS. IT IS A REALLY

02:25:25.650 --> 02:25:27.952
HUGE LEFT FOR IT- ARE TAKING A

02:25:28.019 --> 02:25:30.054
MEMBER AGENCY STAFF TO WRITE

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:32.457
LONG ARDUOUS GRANT APPLICATIONS.

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:33.591
AND THE BUDGETS OF THE AGENCIES

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:35.059
ARE SO TIGHT THAT. IT'S REALLY

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.327
NOT AN OPTION TO HIRE A

02:25:36.394 --> 02:25:38.629
CONSULTANT WHEN WE DON'T KNOW

02:25:38.696 --> 02:25:42.667
THAT THE- GRANT. FUNDING WILL

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:43.601
EVEN BE RECEIVED. I'M ONE

02:25:43.668 --> 02:25:44.669
FUNDING DIRECTED AT PROJECT

02:25:44.735 --> 02:25:46.170
PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE HISTORIC

02:25:46.237 --> 02:25:48.072
SPAN OF. SPENDING ON SHOVEL

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:49.941
READY PROJECTS PUT SOME OF THESE

02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:51.109
SMALLER BASINS THAT WERE ALREADY

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:53.111
BEHIND IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT.

02:25:53.177 --> 02:25:55.046
EVEN FURTHER BEHIND. THERE'S A

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:56.514
HUGE AMOUNT OF FEAR THAT THE

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:58.416
STATE IS GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF

02:25:58.483 --> 02:26:01.285
MONEY NOW. WELL THINK NIGHT

02:26:01.352 --> 02:26:03.187
STILL NEW AND THERE'S A BUDGET

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:05.289
SURPLUS- AND THAT THAT FUNDING

02:26:05.356 --> 02:26:06.657
WILL BE FOCUSED ONLY ON SHOVEL

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:08.259
READY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS OR

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:09.861
AT LEAST PRIORITIZE FORCE

02:26:09.927 --> 02:26:11.796
ALREADY IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS

02:26:11.863 --> 02:26:13.397
FOR THE TSA'S. AND BY THE TIME

02:26:13.464 --> 02:26:14.699
THESE MEDIUM AND HIGH PRIORITY

02:26:14.765 --> 02:26:16.234
BASINS WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:18.269
SHOVEL READY PROJECTS. THIS IS.

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:22.540
A WOMAN OF DON. AND THERE WON'T

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:23.674
BE ANY FUNDING AVAILABLE. BELT

02:26:23.741 --> 02:26:26.177
BACKING MACRON FOR NOW THAT I.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE- WE

ACTUALLY OUR OFFICE REPRESENTS

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:02.380

AND COUNTIES FROM SISKIYOU

02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:06.517
COUNTY DOWN TO KERN COUNTY SO. I

WITH- GSA'S CALLING ME AND

COMPLY WITH SAID MA HOW TO FORM

02:27:14.292 --> 02:27:15.493
I'M TRYING TO DO SEVERAL THINGS

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.261
SO I'M I'M GONNA TOUCH ON FOUR

02:27:17.328 --> 02:27:20.331
ISSUES. THAT I SEE- COME UP

02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:22.967
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ARE ARE

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:25.403
CONSISTENT AMONG GSA QUESTIONS

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:26.971
ABOUT SITE MAP. BEFORE YOU DO

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:28.806
THAT THAT WAY I DO WANT TO TALK

02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.775
REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT WHERE WE'VE

02:27:30.841 --> 02:27:32.810
COME AND SOME PEOPLE TALKED

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:34.812
ABOUT THIS BUT- GIVEN MY NAY

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:36.147
THIS IS BOSTON TWENTY FOURTEEN.

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:38.115
A HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THE

02:27:38.182 --> 02:27:40.484
SURFACE WATER SYSTEM- AND

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:43.054
STATEWIDE PERMITTING. RULES WERE

02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:45.122
PASSED AND WHEN WE ARE

02:27:45.189 --> 02:27:47.325
DEVELOPING SICK MY AND FOLKS

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.526
WERE GIVING FEEDBACK TO THE

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.695
AUTHORS OF SIGMA ONE OF THE

02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:52.163
INTERESTING THINGS WAS TO SEE

02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:55.299
THE LEGISLATIVE. HISTORY IN

02:27:55.366 --> 02:27:57.034
NINETEEN FOURTEEN. DISCUSSED

02:27:57.101 --> 02:27:58.436
POSSIBLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT

02:27:58.502 --> 02:28:00.271
AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE THAT

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:01.038
TIME SAID WE CAN'T DO THAT IS

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:03.407
JUST TOO DIFFICULT IT TOOK AN

02:28:03.474 --> 02:28:07.745
ENTIRE HUNDRED YEARS. TO KIND OF

02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:09.213
RECOVER FROM THAT. CASICH LESSON

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:10.915
A VERY DIFFERENT LAW. THAN

02:28:10.982 --> 02:28:12.149
SERVICE WATER RIGHT. SERVICE

02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:13.718
WATER REGULATIONS HOUSE. FROM

02:28:13.784 --> 02:28:14.852
THE TOP DOWN I THE STATE WERE

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:16.153
RESOURCES CONTROL. AND IT'S A

02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:18.489
PERMITTING LOCK RIGHT SO WE HAVE

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:21.592
A VERY LOCAL. PLANNING BOX THAT

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:23.160
IS THAT IS NOT NO ONE IS ISSUING

02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:25.129
GROUNDWATER PERMITS UNDERSUPPLY

02:28:25.196 --> 02:28:27.932
SO IT'S A VASTLY DIFFERENT- THE

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.233
PLAN IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:32.303
AND FRANKLY MUCH MORE- LOCAL

02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:35.206
BASED. SO WHAT HAPPENED IN

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:36.107
TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK LARGELY

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:38.142
GSA'S DID A GREAT JOB OF THIS.

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.443
WAS THAT YOU HAD A HUGE NUMBER

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:40.678
OF NEW PUBLIC AGENCIES BEING

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:42.480
FORMED. RIGHT GSA'S OUR

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:43.881
PUBLICATION SEES SOMETIMES THEIR

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:46.284
GPAS SOMETIMES THERE ARE JUST A

02:28:46.350 --> 02:28:47.618
NEW HOT THAT IN EXISTING

02:28:47.685 --> 02:28:49.587
AGENCIES WEARING. BUT THAT WAS A

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:52.790
HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK. AND TAKING

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:55.059
ON THAT THE SIGMOD KIND OF

02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.961
CHARGED AS IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT

02:28:57.028 --> 02:28:58.262
AND I'M I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

02:28:58.329 --> 02:29:00.231
I'M AMAZED DAY TODAY TO CD'S

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:02.700
AGENCIES STEP UP. AND DO THE

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:04.502
WORK AND PUT IT TO THE WORK AND

02:29:04.568 --> 02:29:06.904
NOT ONLY FORMING. BUT YOU KNOW

02:29:06.971 --> 02:29:09.073
W. R. AND- OTHER FOLKS HAVE

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:11.275
TALKED ABOUT HOW MANY AGENCIES

02:29:11.342 --> 02:29:12.143
GOT THROUGH THAT TWENTY

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:14.245
SEVENTEEN DEADLINE- THERE WERE

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:15.880
THERE WERE NO. LOCAL AGENCIES

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:16.847
THAT SAID WE'RE JUST NOT DOING

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:17.948
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY IT

02:29:18.015 --> 02:29:19.817
STATE YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:20.985
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO THERE'S A

02:29:21.052 --> 02:29:23.254
HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK DONE AT THE

02:29:23.321 --> 02:29:24.388
GSA LEVEL I MEAN PEOPLE REALLY

02:29:24.455 --> 02:29:26.324
DEDICATED TO GETTING IT DONE AND

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:27.658
YOU SEE THAT ALSO WITH THE

02:29:27.725 --> 02:29:29.660
COMPLETION OF PLANTS BOTH IN THE

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:31.228
TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE. AND

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:33.831
TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IN TWENTY

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.333
TWENTY THERE WAS ONE PLAN THERE

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:36.233
WAS A LITTLE BIT LATE AND IT

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.235
CAME IN A MONTH OR TWO LATER.

02:29:38.302 --> 02:29:40.638
AND TWENTY TWENTY TO BRING UP

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:42.406
THE PLANSAND- SO I DON'T WANT.

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:44.742
THIS COMMITTEE TO MISUNDERSTAND

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:47.478
THAT THE- HUGE EFFORT BY LOCAL

02:29:47.545 --> 02:29:48.879
AGENCIES AND IT HAS BEEN LARGELY

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:51.048
SUCCESSFUL. AND HAVING SAID THAT

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:52.216
I THINK THERE ARE FOUR QUESTIONS

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:54.151
THAT COME UP CONTINUALLY IN MY

02:29:54.218 --> 02:30:00.091
PRACTICE. A FROM. FROM LIKE I

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:01.759
SAID STATEWIDE. ONE IS FUNDING

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:02.760
SIERRA JUST TOUCH THAT QUITE BIT

02:30:02.827 --> 02:30:04.095
SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO IN. THAT

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:06.097
IN GREAT. BUT ADAM SAID WHAT IS

02:30:06.163 --> 02:30:07.064
THIS FOR NOT FOR CLEAR. ON THE

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:08.666
AUTHORITY OF FUNDING- HOW TO

02:30:08.733 --> 02:30:11.936
EIGHTEEN. TWENTY SIX AND- THE

02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:14.538
SICK MY THIRTIES THEMSELVES-

02:30:14.605 --> 02:30:16.741
WHAT IS WHAT IS THOSE PROVIDE.

02:30:16.807 --> 02:30:19.744
IN A RELACIONAMENT MENTION

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.979
GROUNDWATER PUMPING- FUNDING

02:30:22.046 --> 02:30:23.748
WHICH IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO

02:30:23.814 --> 02:30:26.217
YOU HAVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:28.119
FUNDING THE GSA'S VASTLY

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:29.420
DIFFERENT LIKE SUMMER MEMBER

02:30:29.487 --> 02:30:31.255
FUNDED LIKE SEARS SOME HAVE DONE

02:30:31.322 --> 02:30:33.257
IT TO EIGHTEEN SOME HAVE RELIED

02:30:33.324 --> 02:30:35.126
ON PROP TWENTY SIX. SOME PEOPLE

02:30:35.192 --> 02:30:36.827
THINK THAT SAID MY GIVES YOU THE

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:38.996
AUTHORITY WITHOUT TO EIGHTEEN

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:40.664
AND TWENTY SIX TO JUST EXACT

02:30:40.731 --> 02:30:42.299
FEES. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:30:42.366 --> 02:30:43.634
CONFUSION THERE AND THESE ARE

02:30:43.701 --> 02:30:46.537
VERY VERY COSTLY REGULATIONS TO

02:30:46.604 --> 02:30:48.139
COMPLY WITH YOU HAVE ANNUAL

02:30:48.205 --> 02:30:49.774
REPORTS YOU HAVE FIVE YOUR

02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:51.108
UPDATES YOU HAVE THE

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.810
ADMINISTRATION AND THAT'S NOT

02:30:52.877 --> 02:30:54.078
EVEN TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS TO

02:30:54.145 --> 02:30:55.946
GET TO SUSTAINABILITY. SO THERE

02:30:56.013 --> 02:30:57.848
ARE A FLEET OF BRAND NEW PUBLIC

02:30:57.915 --> 02:30:59.817
AGENCIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF WORK

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:01.919
TO DO THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE- I

02:31:01.986 --> 02:31:03.521
KNOW D. W. R. FUNDING HAS BEEN

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:05.122
CRITICAL IN GETTING THROUGH THIS

02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:07.725
FIRST STEP. BUT ADMITS THAT DIES

02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.693
OFF OR IF THAT FUNDING DRIES UP-

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.061
WE'RE GOING TO BE IN A LOT OF

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:12.863
TROUBLE SO FUNDING IS A HUGE

02:31:12.930 --> 02:31:15.766
ISSUE. SECOND D. AVID LAND USE

02:31:15.833 --> 02:31:18.502
COMPONENTS OF SIGMA AND REALLY

02:31:18.569 --> 02:31:20.271
SAID MUCH SPECIFICALLY LEFT LAND

02:31:20.337 --> 02:31:21.639
USE AND WHILE PERMITTING WITH

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.240
AUTHORITY WITH COUNTIES. THEY

02:31:23.307 --> 02:31:25.342
DID NOT GIVE THAT TO GSA IS THAT

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:26.477
HAS BEEN ATTENTION AND I THINK

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:28.345
WILL BE A CONTINUING TENSION OF

02:31:28.412 --> 02:31:30.114
HOW GSA'S WORK WITH EXISTING

02:31:30.181 --> 02:31:32.917
COUNTIES. IF WHILE PERMITTING

02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:35.152
AND WELL APPLICATIONS FOR NEW

02:31:35.219 --> 02:31:37.054
WELL PERMITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH

02:31:37.121 --> 02:31:38.789
OR NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE G. S.

02:31:38.856 --> 02:31:40.925
P. ON THE GROUND. SIGNET DOESN'T

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:42.560
TALK ABOUT THAT AT ALL SO

02:31:42.626 --> 02:31:43.961
THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:45.429
COMMUNICATION THERE I KNOW SOME

02:31:45.496 --> 02:31:48.032
COUNTIES HAVE KIND OF. TRIED TO-

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:50.468
FILL THAT GAP AND I THINK WITH

02:31:50.534 --> 02:31:52.436
MIXED SUCCESS SO FAR I'M NOT SO

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:54.171
THAT'S AN OPEN ISSUE THAT I

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:55.139
THINK EVERYBODY'S AND HAS ASKED

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.408
ME ABOUT- THIRD THE ROLES OF

02:31:57.475 --> 02:31:58.909
GSA'S AND TALKED A LITTLE BIT

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:00.277
ABOUT IT TODAY. WITH WITH THE

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.079
RIGHT TO DRINKING WATER. AND

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:05.950
MITIGATION. ABBOTT HOUSE. AS

02:32:06.016 --> 02:32:07.618
POWERFUL AS GSA'S IN IT AND I

02:32:07.685 --> 02:32:08.919
AND A NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES THAT

02:32:08.986 --> 02:32:10.454
SEGMENT GIVES CSA'S GSA'S ARE

02:32:10.521 --> 02:32:12.490
NOT WATER PROVIDERS THEY'RE NOT

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:14.525
WATER SUPPLIERS. AND SEGMENT

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:16.393
DOES NOT INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:23.133
TO MITIGATE. DOT HAS KIND. OF

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:24.869
BEEN READ INTO THE LOCK- AND-

02:32:24.935 --> 02:32:26.103
YOU KNOW WE SEE HOW THAT GOES

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.071
BUT BUT- GEN ARE GONNA HAVE TO

02:32:27.137 --> 02:32:28.939
WORK WITH THE STATE. WAS SAFER

02:32:29.006 --> 02:32:30.040
WITH COUNTIES AND WITH OTHER WE

02:32:30.107 --> 02:32:33.511
HAVE THE TOOLS. TO MITIGATE AND

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:35.913
PROVIDE FOR AND GOOD QUALITY

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:39.216
DRINKING WATER OFTENTIMES. SUCKS

02:32:39.283 --> 02:32:41.018
THINK THAT GSA'S ARE SADDLED

02:32:41.085 --> 02:32:42.887
WITH THIS YOU HAVE TO FIX ALL

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:44.855
THE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS. I'M

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:45.890
JUST A FRANKLY DON'T HAVE THE

02:32:45.956 --> 02:32:47.157
AUTHORITIES OR THE

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:48.926
INFRASTRUCTURE OR THE ON THE

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:51.195
GROUND I'M ABILITY TO DO THAT.

02:32:51.262 --> 02:32:53.697
SO THAT'S AN EXPECTATION WHICH

02:32:53.764 --> 02:32:54.265
FRANKLY ISN'T INCLUDED IN

02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:55.833
SEGMENT CURRENTLY. BUT WE'RE

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.234
GONNA READ THAT INTO SIGMA GOING

02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:58.836
FORWARD WE'RE GONNA NEED TO GET

02:32:58.903 --> 02:33:00.337
THESE YES IS A LOT OF HELP. A

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:02.873
LOT OF FUNDING. AND TAKE IT TAKE

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:05.910
A DIFFERENT LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE

02:33:05.976 --> 02:33:06.544
RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT INCLUDED.

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:07.444
AND THEN FINALLY AND I THINK

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:09.380
PROBABLY THE TENSION THAT WE'VE

02:33:09.446 --> 02:33:11.248
SEEN THROUGHOUT STATE MY FROM

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:13.384
ITS INCEPTION. AND I THINK IT'S

02:33:13.450 --> 02:33:15.553
ONLY GOING TO INCREASE- IS THE

02:33:15.619 --> 02:33:17.588
STATE ROLE BEGINS TO POTENTIALLY

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:19.990
COME ON. ON BOARD HERE IS THE

02:33:20.057 --> 02:33:21.825
TENSION BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL

02:33:21.892 --> 02:33:24.061
AND STATE REGULATION THAT IS A

02:33:24.128 --> 02:33:26.597
HUGE ISSUE. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:28.666
IT IN RECHARGE SOMEONE BROUGHT

02:33:28.732 --> 02:33:30.334
UP THE CURRENT WATER BRING WHICH

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:33.037
IS A GREAT. BANKING PROGRAM- BUT

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:34.638
IT'S LARGELY BECAUSE IT WAS

02:33:34.705 --> 02:33:36.340
LOCALLY DRIVEN LOCALLY

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:39.677
CONTROLLED. THERE'S NOT. YOU

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:41.412
KNOW A HUGE AMOUNT OF STATE

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:45.549
REGULATION. DIET IT IS THAT THEY

02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:47.017
HAVE TO JUMP IT'S AN ESTABLISHED

02:33:47.084 --> 02:33:49.453
GREAT MULTI BENEFITS- BANKING

02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:51.322
PROGRAM. BUT IF WE WANT THAT TO

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:52.856
HAPPEN STATEWIDE WE'RE GOING TO

02:33:52.923 --> 02:33:54.592
REALLY HAVE TO THINK CRITICALLY.

02:33:54.658 --> 02:33:56.293
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:58.395
LOCALS. GETTING THINGS DONE ON

02:33:58.462 --> 02:34:01.131
THE GROUND AND- THE STATE.

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:04.635
HAVING KIND OF AN OVER

02:34:04.702 --> 02:34:05.269
REGULATORY COMPONENT. SO WE ARE

02:34:05.336 --> 02:34:06.370
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT WE'RE

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:07.805
GONNA SEE THAT END OF THE DAY

02:34:07.871 --> 02:34:08.906
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH REVIEW OF

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:11.442
PLANS THE STATE LOCAL TENSION.

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:13.077
AND OF COURSE THE STATE WATER

02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:14.178
BOARD WALKED US THROUGH A VERY

02:34:14.244 --> 02:34:15.613
KIND OF FRAMEWORK VERY HIGH

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:17.448
LEVEL PROCESS FOR THE STATE

02:34:17.514 --> 02:34:19.249
WATER BOARD. AND DETERMINING

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:21.719
BASINS WHEN THEIR PROBATIONARY

02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:23.754
SIGMA FRANKLY DOESN'T HAVE A LOT

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.556
OF INFORMATION ON THAT IT'S VERY

02:34:25.623 --> 02:34:27.625
VERY FRAMEWORKDRIVEN. DECISIONS

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:28.859
AT THE STATE WATER BOARD AND YOU

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:30.628
DO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

02:34:30.694 --> 02:34:31.895
ON THE GROUND WITH REGARD TO HOW

02:34:31.962 --> 02:34:34.064
TO KEEP LOCALS IN CONTROL. EVEN

02:34:34.131 --> 02:34:35.199
IF THEY GO PROBATIONARY AND HOW

02:34:35.265 --> 02:34:39.003
TO GET LOCAL STEP TO TAKE BACK-

02:34:39.069 --> 02:34:40.704
AT LOCAL CONTROL OF BASINS WHEN

02:34:40.771 --> 02:34:42.506
THEY DO GO PROBATIONARY IS VERY

02:34:42.573 --> 02:34:44.141
MUCH UP IN THE AIR. IT'S GOING

02:34:44.208 --> 02:34:45.943
TO BE ATTENTION THAT CONTINUES

02:34:46.010 --> 02:34:47.344
TO REAR ITS HEAD AND I THINK WE

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:49.413
SHOULD BE VERY VERY CAREFUL-

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:52.016
ABOUT LEADING LOCALS- NOT ONLY.

02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:54.184
BE ABLE TO DO PROJECTS THAT THAT

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:56.620
NEED THAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:57.221
TO SUSTAINABILITY BUT TO GIVE

02:34:57.287 --> 02:34:59.123
THEM BACK THAT LOCAL CONTROL IF

02:34:59.189 --> 02:35:01.425
THEY HAVEN'T MET- THE MARKS

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:04.194
THAT. ARE SET OUT SO WE'RE GOING

02:35:04.261 --> 02:35:04.928
TO BE A LOT OF ATTENTION TO

02:35:04.995 --> 02:35:06.997
THAT- AGAIN LOCALS FROM MY

02:35:07.064 --> 02:35:08.599
PERSPECTIVE FROM REALLY ROLLED

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:10.534
UP THEIR SLEEVES. I WORK WITH

02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:13.170
THEM DAY TO DAY SO I CAN TELL

02:35:13.237 --> 02:35:17.241
YOU THAT THEY ARE. WORKING- DO

02:35:17.307 --> 02:35:20.377
YOU GET TO TELL DATA GAPS. I

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:21.345
WHICH WERE GIANT. AT THE

02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:23.213
BEGINNING WAS SICK MONTH- THEY

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:24.882
JUST WORKS SO HARD. SO I AM I

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:26.183
KNOW THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:27.117
INDEED WE ARE HAVE BEEN BOTH

02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:28.952
TREMENDOUSLY. ON KEEPING LOCAL

02:35:29.019 --> 02:35:30.988
CONTROL- BUT I THINK FROM A

02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.022
LEGISLATIVE PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE

02:35:32.089 --> 02:35:34.224
TO KEEP THAT- AB COMPONENTS

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.492
SEGMENT AS WELL. SO THOSE ARE

02:35:35.559 --> 02:35:37.227
THE FOUR ISSUES THAT I SEE DAY

02:35:37.294 --> 02:35:38.662
TO DAY AND I THINK- WILL

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:40.831
CONTINUE TO COME UP. AND AGAIN

02:35:40.898 --> 02:35:43.300
STATEWIDE- FOLKS ASK ABOUT EVERY

02:35:43.367 --> 02:35:44.868
DAY. SO HOW DO YOU TAKE ANY

02:35:44.935 --> 02:35:46.103
QUESTIONS AND AGAIN THANKS

02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:47.371
THANKS FOR LETTING US PROVIDE

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:49.339
KIND OF THIS LOCAL- ON THE

02:35:49.406 --> 02:35:51.241
GROUND PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:53.277
VERY MUCH MISS CAN CAVE- IT WAS

02:35:53.343 --> 02:35:55.279
VERY INSIGHTFUL THANK YOU VERY

02:35:55.345 --> 02:35:56.947
MUCH I AGREE WITH LOCAL CONTROL

02:35:57.014 --> 02:35:59.383
COMPLETELY SO. LET'S MOVE ON TO

02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:01.685
OUR- FINAL ONE IN- DAVID

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:09.727
FROM NAPA COUNTY. AND. WELCOME

02:36:09.793 --> 02:36:10.761
MY FRIEND DAVID MORRISON. YES

02:36:10.828 --> 02:36:12.896
IT'S BEEN A WHILE HER YEAH. GOOD

AND- ARE UNDER FOR THE PRO OF

02:36:17.134 --> 02:36:18.902
SPEAKING BEFORE IT MORNING. I'D

02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:20.304
LIKE TO BRING REVIEW WHAT NAPA

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:21.839
COUNTY'S BEEN DOING. WHERE WE

02:36:21.905 --> 02:36:23.574
ARE NOW AND WHAT THE NEXT FEW

02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:26.143
YEARS LOOK LIKE. NEVER COUNTIES

02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:27.444
BEEN STUDYING GROUNDWATER FOR

02:36:27.511 --> 02:36:29.213
OVER SIXTY YEARS AND HAS BEEN

02:36:29.279 --> 02:36:29.880
ACTIVELY MANAGING IT'S OUR

02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:31.281
PERSONAL PASSED THIRTY YEARS IS

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:33.617
NOT A NEW SUBJECT FOR US. OUR

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:34.618
LAND USE THE SENATE ON

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:37.554
AGRICULTURE THE GENERAL REQUIRES

02:36:37.621 --> 02:36:38.989
MUCH LESS WATER THAN OTHER CROPS

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.357
. IN FACT MANY VINEYARDS OR EVEN

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:41.992
TRY FARM WITH. PROBLEM WATER OR

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:45.662
SERVICE WATER. OUR LAND YOU ARE

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:47.564
CITIES ALMOST REAL ON SURFACE

02:36:47.631 --> 02:36:49.299
WATER RECYCLED WATER TO RELIEVE

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:51.535
THE AQUIFER. AND WE HAVE STRUCK

02:36:51.602 --> 02:36:52.836
FARMAN OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION

02:36:52.903 --> 02:36:53.904
POLICIES IN PLACE SINCE THE

02:36:53.971 --> 02:36:55.139
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATION'S

02:36:55.205 --> 02:36:57.775
FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE IN

02:36:57.841 --> 02:36:59.009
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AS A

02:36:59.076 --> 02:37:00.844
RESULT OF THIS FORWARD THINKING

02:37:00.911 --> 02:37:02.045
STRATEGY NAPA GROUNDWATER LEVELS

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:03.714
ARE HISTORICALLY STABLE WITH

02:37:03.781 --> 02:37:05.315
LITTLE TO NO SUBSIDENCE OR WATER

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:07.618
QUALITY ISSUES THAT WE SEE

02:37:07.684 --> 02:37:08.952
ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. THERE

02:37:09.019 --> 02:37:09.887
ARE SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF

02:37:09.953 --> 02:37:11.221
CALIFORNIA NAP WAS TAKEN TO

02:37:11.288 --> 02:37:12.656
PROTECT AND CONSERVE GROUNDWATER

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:14.324
OVER THE YEARS. IN NINETEEN

02:37:14.391 --> 02:37:15.459
NINETY WE ADOPTED OUR WATER

02:37:15.526 --> 02:37:16.827
AVAILABILITY DALLAS'S GUIDELINES

02:37:16.894 --> 02:37:18.962
TO EVALUATE THE IMPACTS TO

GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION ON NEARBY

02:37:20.597 --> 02:37:22.032
WELLS. ROTATED TWENTY FIFTEEN TO

02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:23.433
LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO

02:37:23.500 --> 02:37:25.369
OCCUR FIRST AND AGAIN TOOK A

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:26.470
LOOK AT POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO

02:37:26.537 --> 02:37:30.440
SURFACE WATER INTERACTION. AND

02:37:30.507 --> 02:37:31.542
GROUNDWATER DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS

02:37:31.608 --> 02:37:32.109
. OUR SYSTEM UPDATING THOSE

02:37:32.176 --> 02:37:35.345
AGAIN. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:36.413
WE DESIGNATED PUTS CALLED

02:37:36.480 --> 02:37:38.382
MILLIKAN SARCO TOOK LATE TO THE

02:37:38.448 --> 02:37:40.184
CASE WATER DEFICIENT AREAS THIS

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:41.051
IS EVERYWHERE YOU SEEN

02:37:41.118 --> 02:37:42.252
SIGNIFICANT GROUNDWATER

02:37:42.319 --> 02:37:44.521
WITHDRAWALS AND WHAT WE SAID WAS

02:37:44.588 --> 02:37:46.056
THAT IT WITHIN THAT AREA

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:47.991
MOLANDER MORE WATER THAN THEY

02:37:48.058 --> 02:37:49.493
WERE USING AT THE TIME IN

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:51.562
NINETEEN NINETY NINE. SO IF YOU

02:37:51.628 --> 02:37:53.730
WANTED TO PUT IN A QUARTER ACRE

02:37:53.797 --> 02:37:55.299
HALF ACRE VINEYARD YOU HAVE TO

02:37:55.365 --> 02:37:56.934
TAKE OUT YOUR LOCK YOUR TAKE OR

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.302
JUST WEARING COOL YOU HAD TO CUT

02:37:58.368 --> 02:37:59.903
BACK ON RESIDENTIAL CONSUMPTION

02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:01.138
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER

02:38:01.205 --> 02:38:01.939
HOUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THE

02:38:02.005 --> 02:38:05.642
SAME TAKE OUT TO LANDSCAPING-

02:38:05.709 --> 02:38:07.511
VINEYARD- THERE'S NO THAT. ARE

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.613
KNOWN IMPACT. WITH THAT AREA. WE

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:11.081
DESIGNATE THE SECOND. TO

EIGHTEEN IN THE NORTHEAST AREA.

02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:14.618
WE CREATED A WATERSHED

02:38:14.685 --> 02:38:17.120
INFORMATION CONSERVATION COUNCIL

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:18.121
TWENTY THOUSAND TO LOOK AT THE

02:38:22.092 --> 02:38:23.460
BASIN ANALYSIS REPORT THAT WAS

02:38:23.527 --> 02:38:24.461
SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

02:38:24.528 --> 02:38:26.463
CIGNA AS THE ALTERNATIVE

02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:28.832
GROUNDWATER SOMEPLACE. WE FORM

02:38:28.899 --> 02:38:30.067
THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:38:30.133 --> 02:38:31.635
AGENCY IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND

02:38:31.702 --> 02:38:33.136
THAT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE TO WORK

02:38:33.203 --> 02:38:35.505
VERY VERY HARD VERY VERY FAST

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:36.406
YOU CAN CLEAR PLAN WITHIN TWENTY

02:38:36.473 --> 02:38:38.141
FIVE MONTHS. THAT MAKE THE

02:38:38.208 --> 02:38:40.477
DEADLINE. A SENIOR WE ALSO

02:38:40.544 --> 02:38:42.179
JOINED WITH THE CITY OF NAPA AND

02:38:42.246 --> 02:38:43.981
ENJOY WATERSHED MONITORING STUDY

02:38:44.047 --> 02:38:45.816
TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS OF LAND

02:38:45.883 --> 02:38:48.552
USE OUR OF THEM JUST RESERVOIRS

02:38:48.619 --> 02:38:49.152
. TWENTY TWENTY WE CREATED WE

02:38:49.219 --> 02:38:50.554
WORK WITH THE CITIES TO PREPARE

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:52.556
DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLAN. AND

02:38:52.623 --> 02:38:53.757
JUST IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE

02:38:53.824 --> 02:38:55.192
FORMED A DROP OF WATER SHORTAGE

02:38:55.259 --> 02:38:57.194
TASK FORCE AS A CONSISTENT WITH

02:38:57.261 --> 02:38:59.863
STATE REQUIREMENTS. ALL THE WORK

02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:01.765
WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST IS STILL

02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:02.900
NOT ENOUGH TO MEET OUR CURRENT

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:05.302
CHALLENGES. WHAT RANGE OCTOBER

02:39:05.369 --> 02:39:06.670
DECEMBER IT CERTAINLY HELPED.

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:07.838
THE TOTAL FOR THIS YEAR

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:10.540
REPRESENTS ONLY 66% OF THE HAD

02:39:10.607 --> 02:39:11.608
AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL FOR NOW

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:13.443
BUT- OUR LOCAL RESERVOIRS ARE

02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:15.612
NEARLY FULL BUT THEY PROVIDE

02:39:15.679 --> 02:39:16.813
ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF MUNICIPAL

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:18.649
WATER. REMAINDER COMES FROM THE

02:39:18.715 --> 02:39:20.450
STATEWATER PROJECT WHICH WILL

02:39:20.517 --> 02:39:22.052
RECEIVE ONLY 25% OF OUR NORMAL

02:39:22.119 --> 02:39:24.655

GROUNDWATER STORAGE STABLE BUT

02:39:26.156 --> 02:39:28.191
HAS DECREASED ABOUT 15% OVER THE

02:39:28.258 --> 02:39:30.761
PAST TWO THREE YEARS. ALTHOUGH

02:39:30.827 --> 02:39:31.595
EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE

02:39:31.662 --> 02:39:33.130
CONCERNING THE FUTURE OUTLOOK IS

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:34.831
MORE WORRISOME. EXPERIMENTAL

02:39:34.898 --> 02:39:36.566
LONG RANGE MODELS RUN BY THE

02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:37.134
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:39.169
OTHER AGENCIES INDICATE THE NAPA

02:39:39.236 --> 02:39:40.270
COUNTY MAY RECEIVE BELOW AVERAGE

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:42.739
RAINFALL ALL THE WAY THROUGH

02:39:42.806 --> 02:39:44.308
APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE.

02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:46.109
NOT ONLY BE MAYBE LOOKING AT A

02:39:46.176 --> 02:39:47.811
THIRD YEAR DROUGHT THIS SUMMER

02:39:47.878 --> 02:39:50.080
BUT A FOURTH YEAR DROP NEXT YEAR

02:39:50.147 --> 02:39:51.581
. BECAUSE OF THESE POTENTIAL

02:39:51.648 --> 02:39:53.116
THREATS THAT WAS FULLY ENGAGED

02:39:53.183 --> 02:39:54.518
MISTAKE WAS THE CENTERPIECE OF

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:55.886
THEIR EFFORTS TO CAREFULLY STORE

02:39:55.953 --> 02:39:57.721
ARE PREFERRED TO THE FUTURE. BUT

02:39:57.788 --> 02:39:59.089
THERE'S A LOT TO DO IN A VERY

02:39:59.156 --> 02:40:01.425
SHORT TIME SO WHAT ARE WE DOING.

02:40:01.491 --> 02:40:02.559
THAT'S A PASSED WE'RE WE DOING

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:04.227
NOW. OUR GROUNDWATER

DECISION MAKING LOCAL

02:42:50.293 --> 02:42:51.061
GOVERNMENTS COULD USE MORE
