THANK YOU ALL -- IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH THE OF THE NUMBER OF THE LIMON AND IS A MEMBER -- I CARE CARE CURRY. AT TODAY'S THE BEGINNING OF WEEK FOUR AS YOUR CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURER THAT'S WHY HAVE TIM SCHAFER HERE WITH ME. AS MANY HERE IN THE ROOM NO IS A MEMBER OF THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO BANK THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY FOR THE PAST. FOUR YEARS AND PUBLIC BANKING HAS BEEN AN IDEA THAT HAS GAINED MOMENTUM ESPECIALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I APPLAUD TREASURER FORMER TREASURER JOHN CHIANG AND HIS DEPUTY TIM SCHAFER FOR CONVENING A SERIES OF PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER DOZENS OF EXPERTS AND SCORES A PUBLIC SPEAKERS. TO WEIGH IN ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND TAXATION ISSUES THAT SURROUND THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. MY ROLE TODAY'S TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC BANKING BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT MY OFFICE DOES SO THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY BE A RESOURCE. BUT A WORKING PARTNER IN ALL THINGS RELATED TO BANKING. SO LET'S START WITH STATE BANKS. THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN TO PROMOTE AGRICULTURE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY IN NORTH DAKOTA. IT WAS CAPITALIZE WITH THE PROCEEDS OF A TWO MILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUED BY THE STATE. UNDER NORTH DAKOTA STATE LAW ALL STATE FUNDS MUST IT MUST BE THE DEPOSITED. UNDER NORTH DAKOTA STATE LAW ALL STATE FUNDS MUST BE DEPOSITED INTO THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WHICH DOES NOT HAVE DEPOSIT INSURANCE. BUT IS INSTEAD INSURED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA. TODAY THEY PROMISE PRIMARILY PARTNER WITH LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS TO FACILITATE AGRICULTURAL COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND STUDENT LOANS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETEEN WHEN THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WAS FORMED THERE HAVE BEEN MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS TO OPEN STATE PUBLIC BANKS. HOWEVER IT WASN'T UNTIL RECENTLY THAT ANOTHER PUBLIC BANK OPENED ITS DOORS. THE TERRITORIAL BANK OF AMERICAN SAMOA BANK TECHNICALLY OPENED ITS DOORS IN OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT WAS ONLY ABLE TO OFFER NARAL MENU OF SERVICES UNTIL. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALLOWED IT ACCESS TO THE U. S. PAYMENT SYSTEM. THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP A CORRESPONDENT BANKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE US BANK SO TODAY THE TERRITORIAL BANK OF AMERICA SAMOA. ISSUES DEBIT CARDS CHECKS ALLOWS WHY PROVIDES COMMERCIAL LOANS AND CREDITS TO SMALL BUSINESSES. THIS BANK DID NOT OBTAIN DEPOSIT INSURANCE BUS IS NOT SUBJECT TO MANY OF THE SUPER OF HISTORIAL ROLES OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP. IN AMERICAN SAMOA MORE THAN HALF OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE AT NEAR OR BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. AND THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY A CASH BASED ECONOMY SINCE THE BANK OF HAWAII LEFT THE MARKET IN THE TERRITORY IN. TWENTY TWELVE SO WHAT DID WE LEARN FROM 1-919-220-0018 CLOSE TO A HUNDRED YEARS LATER. IN GENERAL WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT EASY TO OPEN A STATE PUBLIC BANK BUT IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AS SOME OF THE SPEAKERS I'M SURE WE'LL TALK ABOUT TODAY. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT I'M EXCITED TO BE YOUR STATE TREASURER AND TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM VERY DEDICATED AND SAVVY PROFESSIONALS IN MY OFFICE THAT HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE AREAS THAT PUBLIC BANKING ADVOCATES ARE FOCUSED ON? I'D LIKE TO JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS UNDER MY OFFICE THAT MANY. UP OF THE PUBLIC MAY NOT BE AWARE OF AS YOUR STATE BANKER THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WAS CREATED IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IN. EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE TODAY OVER TWO TRILLION DOLLARS GOES THROUGH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE EVERY YEAR. MY OFFICE MANAGERS NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL FUNDS AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING GENERAL OBLIGATION AND LEASE REVENUE BONDS OF THE STATE. CALIFORNIA PRESENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT CAPITAL FORMATION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. ONE PROGRAM CALLED THE STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW STATES TO BUILD ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS FOR STATE SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS INCLUDING COLLATERAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS. CAPITAL AXES PROGRAMS AND LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS. IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM OR CALLED CAL CAP. WHICH IS ADMINISTRATE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY ONE OF THE BOARDS COMMISSIONS AND IT'S ALREADY UNDER THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND WHICH I CHAIR. CAL CAP WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES OBTAIN LOANS THROUGH PARTICIPATING LENDERS. MORE DIRECTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA USES THE NUMBER UP FOR DEPOSITORY SERVICES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT LOCAL ECONOMIES IN OUR STATE. THE LION SHARE OF THE STATE'S SURPLUS FUNDS IS DEPOSITED INTO THE POOL MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT. WHICH ARE PROFESSIONALLY MANAGED BY THE STAFF IN MY OFFICE. A PRESENT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THESE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN SHORT TERM LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH THE US TREASURY AND FEDERAL FEDERAL AGENCY SECURITIES. WITHIN THE POOL MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT WE OPERATE THE TIME DEPOSIT PROGRAM CREATED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE TO ALLOW THE STATE TREASURE TO PLACE DEPOSITS WITH ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WHICH ARE FEDERALLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BANKS SAVINGS BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS. THESE PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MUST MEET MINIMUM CREDIT QUALITY STANDARDS AND MEET COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT RATING OF NOT LESS THAN SATISFACTORY. THIS MEANS THAT THE RATING IS BASED ON A REGULATORS OPINION ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVELY THESE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE HOME MORTGAGES SMALL BUSINESS LOANS SMALL FARM LOANS. AND SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. THESE JUDGMENTS THESE JUDGMENTS ALSO APPLY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUPPORT TO NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT MEET LOW TO MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND CAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. THE CHARGES OFFICE ALSO OPERATES A CALIFORNIA LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND WHICH WAS FORMED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO ENABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE THERE FUNDS MANAGED BY PROFESSIONAL MANAGERS IN MY OFFICE. THE NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS I MENTIONED BEFORE INCLUDES ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE ON BEHALF OF MORE THAN. TWENTY THREE HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. AM I ALSO OFF ALSO OVERSEE THE NINE AND 4% TAX EXEMPT BOND FINANCING AND CREDIT PROGRAM THAT HELPS BUILD NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE TERM PUBLIC BANK CAN MEAN MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. I BELIEVE THE KEY QUESTION WE NEED TO HONE IN ON IS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WE ARE SEEKING TO SOLVE AND WHAT ARE THE GOALS WE WHICH TO ACHIEVE. I LOOK FORWARD TO LISTENING TO ALL OF THE EXPERTS BECAUSE HE I IN MY OFFICE STAND READY. TO FIND A PATH AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTIONS TO MAKE BANKING SERVICES MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EQUITABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SO LONG AS THOSE ASS PROPERLY PROTECT TAXPAYERS INTERESTS AND BENEFIT THE ATTENDED AUDIENCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TIM WOULD YOU LIKE THE IS TO SPEAK AT THIS POINT. NO MA'AM THANK YOU I'LL LET DEFERRED TO THE TREASURER AND THE FOLKS FROM D. B. O.

OKAY -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS ISN'T THAT FUN MADAM CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF -- I AM THREE I KNOW AND THE COMMISSIONER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY IN THIS HEARING. THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT LICENSE AND REGULATE OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND LICENSEES. EITHER ENTITIES OR INDIVIDUALS. THESE LICENSEES PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER MORE PERTINENT TO THIS DISCUSSION IS THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LICENSES AND SUPERVISES STATE CHARTERED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. INCLUDING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BAY OVER A HALF A TRILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS. WE EXIST DO REGULATORY EXAMS ON THESE BANKS EVERY TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR MORE OFTEN IF THE NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THEY RUN AND SAFE SOUND. MANNER AS WELL AS LAWFULLY. AS COMMISSIONER I'M ALSO THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE LOCAL. AGENCY SECURITY PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM REVIEWS WEEKLY AND QUARTERLY REPORTS FROM APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. HOLDING OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSITS. IT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY. TO ENSURE THESE DEPOSITS ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED BY THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. IN YOUR WRITTEN INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY YOU ASKED US TO PROVIDE INSIGHT AND EXPERTISE RELATED TO THE MUNICIPAL BANKING MODEL. SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED INFORMATION ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS AND MAKES APPROVAL DECISIONS ON NEW BANK CHARTER APPLICATIONS. HOW THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEAS BANKS THAT ACCEPT DEPOSITS FROM LOCAL AGENCIES REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS UNIQUE? TO A BANK THAT IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND FINALLY THE DEPARTMENT'S VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER A STATE LEVEL DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE DEPARTMENT'S SUPERVISION AND OVERSIGHT. I WOULD I WILL BE OFFERING THE COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. OWNED BY THE STATE. AS WELL AS THE CONCEPT OF TRANSFORMING THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE BANK INTO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. BANK CHARTER APPLICATION APPROVALS. ONE OF THE BANKS REGULATE ONE OF THE BANK REGULATORS MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IS TO A VALUE WAY TO APPLICATIONS TO ESTABLISH A NEW BANK. THESE ARE KNOWN AS THE NOVO APPLICATIONS THE INTEGRITY OF THE BANKING SYSTEM. DEPENDS ON THIS WORK BEING DONE WITH THE MOST DILIGENCE. THE PROCESS INVOLVES A RIGOROUS REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED BANK TO DETERMINE WHETHER. IT WILL HAVE THE CAPITAL. ASSET QUALITY MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. EARNINGS CAPABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROFILES REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. BANKS SERVE THE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AND THEIR COMMUNITY. AN APPLICATION TO ESTABLISH A NEW BANK MAY BE APPROVED ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA IS MET. THE PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AN ADVANTAGE WILL BE PROMOTED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROPOSED BANK. THE PROPOSED BANK WILL HAVE A REASONABLE PROMISE OF A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. THE PROPOSED BANK IS BEING FORMED FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE THAN THE LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVES CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE BANKING LAW. THE PROPOSED CAPITAL STRUCTURE IS ADEQUATE. THE PROPOSED FFICERS AND DIRECTORS HAVE SUFFICIENT BANKING EXPERIENCE ABILITY AND STANDING TO AFFORD A REASONABLE PROMISE OF A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION. THE NAME. OF THE PROPOSED BANK. DOES NOT RESEMBLE. SO CLOSELY AS TO LIKELY CAUSE CONFUSION WITH THE NAME OF ANOTHER BANK IN CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY THE APPLICANT HAS APPLIED WITH ALL APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF BANKING LAWS AND RATES. IN REACHING THE END OUR DECISION THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING. THE CHARACTER REPUTATION AND FINANCIAL STANDING OF THE ORGANIZERS AND THEIR MOTIVE. IN SEEKING TO ORGANIZED A PROPOSED BANK. THE NEED FOR A NEW BANK GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE ADEQUACY OF EXISTED EXISTING BANKING AND THE NEED. FOR FURTHER BANK SO MANY OF YOU HERE THE TERM IS THE COMMUNITY OPEN BANK. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS. THE CHARACTER FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BANKING EXPERT EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PROPOSED OFFICERS OF THE BANKS. THE PROPOSED STOCKHOLDERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE BANK. THE ADEQUACY OF THE BANKING FACILITIES TO OPERATE ITS. TO SUPPORT ITS OPERATIONS SKEWS ME. THE ADEQUACY OF CAPITALIZATION TO SUPPORT THE PROJECTED VOLUME AND TYPE OF BUSINESS. THE LIKELIHOOD THE BANK WILL ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY. THE VIABILITY OF A BUSINESS PLAN GIVEN THE ECONOMIC CONDITION GROWTH POTENTIAL AND COMPETITION OF THE PROPOSED MARKET AREA. AND FINALLY WHETHER THE BANK IS FREE. FROM ABUSIVE INSIDER TRANSACTIONS AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. LET ME SPENT A COUPLE MEN'S ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY DEPOSIT OUR DEPOSIT OVERSIGHT. OUR EXAMINERS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE SUPERVISORY PROCESS TO ENSURE. PUBLIC FUNDS ARE PROTECTED. IN PARTICULAR OUR EXAMINERS REVIEW THE FOLLOWING. TO ENSURE LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSITS ARE ADEQUATELY SECURED OR YOU'LL YOU HEARD THE TERM COLLATERALIZED WE VALIDATE THE EXISTENCE OF WAIVER FARMS WHETHER OFFSET THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES NEEDED TO SECURE THOSE DEPOSITS. AND LOCAL AGENCY TREASURERS HAVE THE DISCRETION TO WAIVE THE COLLATERAL REQUIREMENT UP. TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE VERIFIED THAT. TO ENSURE THE ADEQUACY OF WEEKLY AND QUARTERLY REPORTS SUBMITTED TO DPO. AND WE REVIEW THE BANKS LIST OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS TO VALIDATE TH DEPOSIT INFORMATION SUBMITTED FROM THOSE INSTITUTIONS. TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE WEEKLY AND QUARTERLY REPORTS WE REVIEW THE REPORTS FROM THE HOLDERS OF THE DEPOSITORY SECURED SECURITIES. TO VALIDATE THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES PLEDGE TO THE LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSIT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AGENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY STAY BANKING. A BANK THAT IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. SHOULD BE TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OTHER STATE CHARTERED BANK LICENSED OR SUPERVISED BY THE DEPARTMENT. SUCH AN INSTITUTION SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND EXAMINATION SHOULD FOCUS ON THE BASIC COMPONENTS. CAPITAL ASSET QUALITY MANAGEMENT EARNINGS LIQUIDITY AND SENSITIVITY TO MARKET RATE. STATE OVERSIGHT OF A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OWNED BY THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THE DB O. WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE REGULATOR FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION OWNED BY THE STATE. THIS INCLUDES ANY CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE BANK OR ANY EXISTING LENDING PROGRAM. IS EXTENDED FOR EXPANDED BY STATUTE TO BECOME A STATE LEVEL FDIC DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SO PROVIDE SUPERVISION AND OVERSIGHT BY THE DPO WHAT ARE NOT ONLY BE APPROPRIATE BUT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY. AS WITH ALL OTHER DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. IT WOULD LIKELY NEED TO OBTAIN FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE. AND A MASTER ACCOUNT FROM THE FED. TO BE VIABLE. OUR EXAMINATIONS WOULD COVER AGAIN THE SAME COMPONENTS. IN SUCH A SCENARIO. IT WOULD BE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THE DEPOSITS. THE HARD EARNED MONEY OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BUSINESSES OF CALIFORNIA. THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY AGENCY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE TO DO THAT. IN CLOSING THE DEPARTMENT AS ALWAYS WILL OFFER ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ANY POLICY CONSIDERATION THAT. CONSIDER CONSIDERATION RELATED TO PUBLIC BANKING. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- UP AT THIS POINT ANY OF THE MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. OF EITHER. YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU -- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR AT VIEW -- COMMISSIONER -- AND BUT YOU JUST WALKED US THROUGH THE ROLE OF THE DO AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF OVERSIGHT AND THAT. INCLUDING IN ENSURING ADEQUATE. INVOLVEMENT OR OVERSIGHT OF ANY ENTITY THAT TO AT THAT TAKES MONEY. HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ON HOW YOU? COULD ENVISION THE OVERSIGHT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY AROUND CONFLICT OR INTEREST FOR ANY ABUSE I KNOW THAT -- WHEN I THINK OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MY GOSH AMAZING GOOD INTENTION IS THERE BUT CERTAINLY THROUGH TIME WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF PERHAPS ABUSE -- OF PUBLIC DOLLAR FINE OF CITIES ARE AREAS CAN YOU HELP US THINK THROUGH WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE AND DB O. R. WHAT KINDS OF CONCERNS. MORE SPECIFICALLY YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT ARE CURRENTLY THE BANKING LAW WASN'T DESIGNED TO ADDRESS POSSIBLE POLITICAL INFLUENCES. ON AN EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE WOULD CONSIDER FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY. HOWEVER WE WOULD ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THAT DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS THE INSTITUTION IS STRUCTURED. IN A WAY THAT PROHIBITS THOSE TYPES OF INFLUENCES. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT EVERYONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS NOW AND GOING FORWARD HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY. AND WE WOULD EXAMINE AND REGULATE TOWARDS BACK CONFLICT OF INTERESTS POLICY. AND WE WOULD ALSO WANT TO REVIEW IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE. WE WELL CHECK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ALL POLICIES AND REVIEW TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS LOANS INVESTMENTS. AND CONTRACTS AGAIN. THIRD PARTY CONTRACTS AGAIN BEFORE I AND DO INFLUENCE. IF I AM DO INFLUENCE IS DISCOVERED THE DEPARTMENT MAY TAKE AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO CORRECT THAT SITUATION. SO WE DO HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. BUT WHAT BUT WHAT I'M HEARING IS ALSO THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME CREATION OF REGULATIONS -- PROCESS -- TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AND DO INFLUENCE -- IN ANY PARTICULAR WAY -- CAN YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE IDEA THAT A PUBLIC BANK WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM FDA SEE I INSURANCE [inaudible] I KIM. S. FIRST -- FOR STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL BANKS THERE CURRENTLY IS NO REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA LAW. TO BE INSURED [inaudible] HOWEVER. THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATIONS PROVIDE THE STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL BANKS CANNOT OPERATE. UNLESS THEY ARE INSURED BANK. AN INSURED BANK IS DEFINED AND BACK INTO THE CODE THE FINANCIAL CODE AS A BANK WHOSE DEPOSITS ARE FDIC INSURED. IN OTHER WORDS THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATION REQUIRE STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL BANKS TO BE INSURED. HOWEVER. THERE THE FINANCIAL CALLED ALSO ALLOWS THE COMMISSIONER TO WAIVE THE DEPARTMENTS REGULATIONS. THEREFORE IT IS POSSIBLE TO HAVE A STATE CHARTERED COMMERCIAL BANK WHICH COULD OPERATE. UNINSURED ARE PRIVATELY INSURED IF APPROVED BY THE COMMISSIONER. LET ME GO A STEP FURTHER WE WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE SOME TYPE OF INSURANCE BUSINESS. BECAUSE IT IS VITAL TO PROTECT THE DEPOSITS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE BUSINESSES A CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY THERE IS A PRIVATE DEPOSIT INSURANCE MARKET BUT IT IS TRULY ON DEVELOPED ALTHOUGH SOME CREDIT UNIONS HAVE PRIVATE CHAIR INSURANCE FROM A SINGLE PRIVATE INSURER FOR THE COUNTRY. IT HAS YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED THE CALIFORNIA BANKS CAN SUCCESSFULLY OBTAINED A PRIVATE INSURANCE. WE ALSO BELIEVE A PUBLIC BANK WOULD BE UNLIKELY. TO OBTAIN A MASTER ACCOUNT FROM THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL RESERVE IF IT DID NOT HAVE FTA SEE INSURANCE. OR A SUITABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD WITHSTAND SCRUTINY. A MASTER ACCOUNT IS NEEDED TO PERFORM MANY OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS OF ANY BANK THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M. FOR TREASURE Mà IT DOES HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AS WELL. IN YOUR ROLE YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE AYE BANKS CAN YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS OUR REACTIONS. TO THE I. BANK BECOMING A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION -- SINCE THIS IS MY FOURTH WEEK ON THE JOB I'M I'M GOING TO YES. TO MISTER SCHAPER SINCE I HAVEN'T SAT AT ONE OF THE AYE BANK COMMITTEE MEET YET YET BUT I I BETTER HAVE YOU. SEC BECAUSE I MAY SAY IT WRONG. THE FUN NOT SURE I WILL SAY IT COMPLETELY RIGHT THAT I WILL DO MY BEST TO HAVE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION [inaudible] THE THE AYE BANK WOULD. HAVE TO CONFRONT SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND I'D I'D. PLEASE I DON'T WANT THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR ME. SAYING THESE ARE SHOW STOPPERS JUST THINGS THAT AS POLICYMAKERS YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AS THE AYE BANK SHOT. THE I. BANK HAS ONE LOCATION. SO THAT WOULD THEN BEG THE QUESTION. HOW TO ACTUALLY REACH OUT AND SERVICE THE INTENDED AUDIENCE? BUT SINCE THE INTENDED AUDIENCE IS STILL A MOVING TARGET IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO DROP ANCHOR ON THAT. AND SECONDLY -- THE I BANK OF FOR ALL OF THE GOOD IT DOES AND IT DOES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF GOOD IN OUR STATE -- HAS SINCE ITS INCEPTION GENERALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON EITHER BECOMING A CONDUIT ISSUER OF BONDS -- FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE -- TYPICALLY AB AND ENDING -- FOR TO ADMINISTER -- BORROWING PROGRAMS FOR THAT THAT THAT INCORPORATE OTHER -- BORROWING PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STATE THE THE AYE SURF PROGRAM BEING ONE OF THEM AND I DON'T PROFESS TO BE AN EXPERT ON THE AYE BANKS BUSINESS GOES. UNDER THE PAST ADMINISTRATION I WAS ONLY THE ALTERNATE DELEGATE TO THE AYE BANK BOARDS SO I'M SUFFERING FROM. A FROM A THE A BIT OF IGNORANCE ON THAT -- I WOULD ALSO OBSERVE HOWEVER. THAT AND THERE ARE -- AT LEAST A MEASURABLE NUMBER OF THE AYE BANK STAFF. ARE EXPERIENCED COMMERCIAL BANKERS AS WAS THE RECENTLY RETIRED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. SO IT IS NOT AS THOUGH THE AYE BANK IS WITHOUT THE MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE -- AND SO PLEASE DON'T HEAR ME SAYING THAT. I DO BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT IT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF THE KINDS OF PLANS THAT ARE REQUIRED WHEN. EIGHT DID OVER START AT BANK COME THIS AND SAYS. WE WANT TO STAND UP A NEW BANK THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF PLANS. THAT HAVE TO GO IN THAT REVOLVING AROUND THE GOVERNANCE OF THE INSTITUTION THE CREDIT POLICIES THE INSTITUTION CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH. AND MIKE MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE ALLIED BANK WOULD BE REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE THOSE AS WELL AGAIN NOT A SHOW STOPPER BUT CLEARLY -- WOULD PRODUCE SOME FRICTION TO HAVING THE AYE BANK. ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. THANK YOU AND FINAL QUESTION AND FOR THE TREASURES DEPARTMENT WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THAT. I ONE OF THE ROLES THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU PLAY IS AT IN ENSURING THAT TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE PROTECTED -- IN SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW. AGAIN REACTIONS OUR THOUGHTS ON KIND OF THESE AT THIS IDEA AND HOW. THE TREASURES DEPARTMENT WOULD. ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS FUNDS WERE PROTECTED. IF THIS WAS A MODEL THAT WAS BEING CONSIDERED IF THERE WAS A STRUGGLING BANK -- PUBLIC BANK -- HAVE RIGHT NOW -- SO LIKE ARE PULLED MONEY INVESTMENT FUND IT'S ABOUT NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BUT IT IS STATE MONEY AND LOCAL MONEY THAT IS ESSENTIALLY. SPOKEN FOR SO IT'S NOT MONEY SITTING AROUND -- WE CANNOT RISK PUT IT UP AS CAPITAL AND WHAT I BELIEVE IF WE WANTED TO DO A LOCAL BANK IS THAT IT HAS TO BE A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON THE BUDGET. YOU CAN NOT ENCUMBER FUNDS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING USED OR SET ASIDE FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES AND MOST OF HE WALKING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN. YOU KNOW SOMEONE WANTS TO USE THAT FUND TO CAPITALIZE IN ANOTHER ONE THAT IS REALLY NOT. YOU KNOW OUR MONEY TO DO IT THAT IT IS YOU KNOW FOR SET ASIDE FOR THE SCHOOLS ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SO -- THAT IS OUR JOB IS TO MANAGE OF THE STATE'S MONEY TAXPAYERS MONEY OM AND THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW WE DO WE HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES YOU KNOW WE MAKE SURE THAT -- WE COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IF WE ARE MANAGING THEIR MONEY ABOUT. TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AND THEY HAVE ACCESS TO IT THROUGH KIND OF A PORTAL -- SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN DEPOSIT EASIER AND ALSO WITHDRAW THE FUNDS AS NEEDED SO THERE'S NO PAPER TRANSACTIONS ANYMORE BUT IT IS ALL. DONE ELECTRONICALLY AND SO THAT'S KIND OF SOME OF THE GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE MANAGING THE STATE'S FUNDS AND TEMAS POINTING HERE SO TEMAS AT SOMETHING. IT THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I WOULD TRY TO GET VERY SPECIFIC AND WALKING WITH YOU -- ADD TO THE CO CHAIRS AND SAY. THAT BECAUSE ONE OF MY DUTIES IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE'S OVERSEE THE INVESTMENT DIVISION WE SIMPLY WILL NOT. PUT TAX MAYOR MONEY AT IN A LOCAL BANK AND WE HAVE ABOUT SEVENTY TWO OR SEVENTY FOUR LOCAL BANKS. IN WHICH WE DEPOSIT STATE FUNDS AND LAST [inaudible] THE BANK. CAN PROVE ITSELF TO BE CREDIT WORTHY. UNLESS THE BANK CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT IT HAS A SATISFACTORY RATING UNDER THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT THE BANK CAN SECURE THE DEPOSITS WITH COLLATERAL SECURITIES AND YOU HEARD THE COMMISSIONER TALK ABOUT THAT EARLIER -- SO THIS IS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE FOR TO A SIMPLE PERSON THAT DOES THE INNARDS WORK OF THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. HERE'S THE STATE'S MONEY BELONGS TO TAXPAYERS AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT BACK AND THE WAY WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT BACK IS. YOU HAVE TO PLEDGE COLLATERAL TO US -- SO THAT IF YOU CAN'T PAY IT BACK WE TAKE THE COLLATERAL AND SELL IT AND WE CAN RESTORE THE TAXPAYER TO THEIR TO THEIR ORIGINAL CONDITION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR JAN -- OWES HIS MISSILE AND ALL RIGHT. I'D YOU FOR SEEING CHALLENGES IN REGULATING PUBLIC BANKS THAT ARE NOT PRESENT REGULATING PRIVATE BANKS. SAY THAT AGAIN PLEASE DO YOU FORESEE ANY CHALLENGES IN REGULATING PUBLIC BANKS THAT ARE NOT PRESENT WHEN REGULATING PRIVATE BANKS. THE TAXPAYER MONEY AND HOW TO AND THE REPORTING. BACK -- TO THE EITHER THE LOCAL ENTITY OR THE STATE -- THE INFLUENCE OF OTHEROF POLITICAL INFLUENCES -- HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT BEING GAY IS RAN IN A SAFE AND SOUND MANNER -- KEEPING THE VISION CONSISTENT A BUSINESS PLAN FOR A A NEW DID NOBLE BANK. THAT BUSINESS PLAN HAS TO BE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP WITH IT. AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY CAN MAKE MONEY AT IT THAT BUSINESS PLANNED FOR A PUBLIC BANK WOULD HAVE TO STAY CONSISTENT AS WELL. THROUGH A THREE TO FIVE YEAR. TIME FRAME -- THE FOUR BANKS TAXATION IS AN ISSUE. SO HAVE A TAXATION WITH. HELP ME JIMMY. TAXATION HERE BUT IS AN ISSUE AS WELL. OKAY THAT'S EXACTLY WAS KIND OF LOOKING. FOR ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME HE'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OR IF YOU. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ADD TO TREASURER MA AND COMMISSIONER. OUR SECOND PANEL WE WERE HERE FROM. SOME OF THE MOVEMENT I HAVE MET WITH GROUPS AND WHO REPRESENT WHO ARE REPRESENTED ON THIS PANEL AND I KNOW SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALSO HEARD. AND FROM SOME OF THESE FOLKS OUR FIRST SPEAKER WILL BE AT SUSHIL JAKE UP WHO HAS SERVED ON THE TASK FORCE ORGANIZED BY TREASURER CEASE NETTLES FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AS TWO CHILDREN ATTORNEY WHO IS WORKING TO ESTABLISH A CHARTER AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC BANKS AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL. AND ASSIST US TO FEEL WILL BE FOLLOWED BY OUR SECOND SPEAKER DICK MAZES. AYE DICK IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEMOCRACY COLLABORATIVE AND IS ADVOCATING FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE BANK INTO THE A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION THAT WOULD SERVE. LOCAL OVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. HIGH. WE CAN HAVE YOU BOTH COME UP. I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND JOINING THE DISCUSSION. AND I WILL GO AHEAD AND HAVE YOU AT START TO FEEL OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR IS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SO SHE'LL JACOB I'M WITH THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND I'M ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE. ON AS CHAIR LIMóN SAID I WOULD SUPPORT A WAS A PARTICIPANT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL MAKE FEASIBILITY TASK FORCE AND WE'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM TREASURES CISNEROS. ON THAT -- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY FRAMING WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM AS ADVOCATES AND STATEWIDE ADVOCATES. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA IS FACING MULTIPLE CRISES. THE POTENTIAL OF A RAT RECESSION THAT WOULD REDUCE TAX REVENUES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. THE CRISIS OF AFFORDABILITY WITH REGARD TO HOUSING THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK -- AND THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING [inaudible] I AM. CLIMATE CHANGE BUT SPECIFICALLY WILD FIRES IN NATURAL DISASTERS BECOMING AN ANNUAL OCCURRENCE. THAT ARE SEVERELY STRAINING THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE BANKING INDUSTRY CREATING -- A SITUATION WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BECOME OVER RELIANCE ON A FEW LARGE OUT OF STATE BANKS FOR THEIR BANKING SERVICES -- AND THE CONCURRENT LOSS OF OUR LOCAL BANKING INDUSTRY IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING IS AN ALLIANCE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED BANKS HEADQUARTERED. IN CALIFORNIA AS COMMISSIONER ORINDA SAID THERE ARE NOW A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STATE CHARTERED BANKS. WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC LOSS OF LOCAL AND ESPECIALLY COMMUNITY BANKS. WE KNOW THAT THE LOSS OF LOCAL BANKS MEANS A LOSS OF LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKERS. WHO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE EMBEDDED? OUR PROPOSAL TO YOU IS THAT BY DECENTRALIZING AND REINVIGORATING OUR BANKING SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE REGIONAL PUBLIC BANKING CAN HELP US TO CREATE A MORE RESILIENT FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND SUPPORT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FIRST PUBLIC BANKS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES TO CREATE SOUND INVESTMENTS THAT WILL SAVE THEM MONEY. AND ALLOW THEM TO INVEST THEIR PUBLIC DEPOSITS IN FISCALLY SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE ACTIVITIES. SECOND PUBLIC BANKS CAN SAVE TAXPAYER FUNDS AND BRING THEIR TREMENDOUS BANKING BUSINESS BACK TO THE STATE. THAT BUSINESS IS CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY WALL STREET BANKS INSTEAD WE CAN USE THOSE FUNDS. IN THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS PUBLIC BANKS CAN PROVIDE AFFORDABLE LOANS AND LINES OF CREDIT TO LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. THAT CAN PROVIDE A CRITICAL BALL WAR AGAINST DISPLACEMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVING ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS. PUBLIC BANKS CAN INCREASE THE LANDING CAPACITY OF THE LOCAL BANKING SYSTEM TO PARTICIPATION LOANS BY PROVIDING LIQUIDITY AND SERVING AS REGIONAL BANKERS BANKS. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE BRINGS TOGETHER ADVOCATES FROM ACROSS THE STATE SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES. SAN FRANCISCO AND THE EAST BAY. SILICON VALLEY GOING ALL THE WAY UP TO EUREKA IN HUMBOLDT. OUR VISION IS A NETWORK OF PUBLIC BANKS THIRD ARE OWNED AT THE REGIONAL COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL LEVELS. OUR PROPOSAL IS A CHARTER BASED APPROACH. TO PUBLIC BANKING AND BY THAT I MEAN WE ARE NOT SEEKING TO LEGISLATE IN YOUR BANK. WE ARE SEEKING TO PROVIDE A PATHWAY SO THAT LOCALITIES CAN CREATE THEM. THE ALLIANCE'S TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN GOAL IS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A CLEAR PATHWAY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO LICENSE AND REGULATE LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS. THEY WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS SPECIAL PURPOSE COMMERCIAL BANKS. THEY WOULD BE SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITIES FROM THEIR PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS. THESE BANKS WOULD HAVE SEPARATE INDEPENDENT BOARD STAFF BY BANKING PROFESSIONALS. WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE COMMISSIONER <i><u>AN HAS JUST TOLD</i></u> US THE PROCESS BY WHICH YOU FORM A BANK IN CALIFORNIA. SHE TOLD US BY BUT THE EXTENSIVE pORGANIZER'S A BANKS AND THEIR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS WE'RE PROPOSING TO USE THE SYSTEM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. AND APPLY IT TO LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS. WE BELIEVE THE CHARTER APPROACH TO PUBLIC BANKING ENABLES OUR REGIONS TO BE. THAT BECOME PATHWAYS PUBLIC FINANCE. NOT ONE IN WHICH LOCALITIES DECIDE IF THEY WANT BANKS HOW THEY WANT BANKS AND WENT TO LAUNCH THEM. BY DECENTRALIZING THE SUPPORT HE TO CALIFORNIA'S REGIONS WE BELIEVE WE ARE DIVERSIFYING THE RISKS OF PUBLIC BANKING AS WELL AS DIVERSIFYING ITS REWARDS. IN OUR VISION PUBLIC BANKS WILL BE CREATED TO MEET THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF LOCAL ECONOMIES WHETHER IT IS REBUILDING AFTER WILD FIRES FINANCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR PREVENTING DISPLACEMENT OF LOCAL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT AGENCIES. IN ADDITION AFTER CONSULTING WITH COUNTY TREASURER'S AND AND BEING OPEN TO CONTINUE ADDITIONAL CONSULTATIONS WE HAVE TAKEN FEEDBACK AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT REMOVING COLLATERAL IS ATION REQUIREMENTS -- FOR THESE BANKS -- SHOULD BE PART OF OUR LEGISLATION AND IT'S NOT A IN IN OUR PROPOSAL. OUR VIEW IS -- BASED ON THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BACK IN NORTH DAKOTA WHICH YOU HEARD ABOUT -- FROM TREASURE KIANA MAILLET AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT A FEW ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THIS BANK WHICH I FIND SO FASCINATING. THE BANK NORTH DAKOTA PARTNERS WITH CREDIT UNIONS -- AND AS A RESULT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP NORTH DAKOTA HAS MORE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS PER CAPITA. THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN FACT IT HAS NEARLY SIX TIMES AS MANY LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PER PERSON AS A COUNTRY OVERALL. IN WHAT THE COURT -- THE LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE A REMARKABLE 83% OF THE DEPOSIT MARKET. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE ACCOUNT 429%. OF THE DEPOSIT MARKET. WE KNOW THAT'S THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THIS BANK HAS PLAYED AS A CENTRAL BANK PROVIDING LIQUIDITY. EMERGENCY LOANS PARTICIPATION LOANS AND STEPPING IN IN TIMES LIKE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS. THE BANK COMPLETELY AVOIDED THE SUBPRIME LENDING AND AND RISKY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OF WALL STREET. AND WAITING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NORTH DAKOTA'S CONNIE GROUP SEVEN POINT 3% TWICE AS FAST AS ANY OTHER STATE -- AND A KEY PRIORITY FOR THE BANK UNIT IN NORTH DAKOTA IS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG AND STABLE BALANCE SHEET TO PROTECT TAXPAYER MONEY. THIS IS THE VISION FOR THE TYPES OF PUBLIC BANKS WE WANT TO SEE SPREAD THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DICK MAZES. OKAY MY NAME IS -- DICK MAYES THIS AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BANKING START OFF WITH I'M A RETIRED PROFESSOR. IN MEDICAL PHYSICS OF ALL THINGS IS THE BALLOT FOR REMOVED FROM BANKING AS ONE CAN GET. AND AYE MOVED TO CALGARY TARGETS CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AND VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE I MUST SAY -- WHAT I? WHEN A I THINK BROUGHT ME TO THIS WAS LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE MORE THAN ANYTHING? AND LOOKING AT AT HOW INFRASTRUCTURE FX DIFFERENT SOCIETIES I LIVED IN HIGHLY AND PERU FOR ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEY HAD. ESSENTIALLY NO INFRASTRUCTURE AND NO SUPPORT PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND A GREAT DEAL OF INEQUALITY. I ALSO LIVED IN ANOTHER PLACE CALLED IT'S TAKEN CARE OF EVERY BIT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS TAKEN CARE OF BY. THE THE GOVERNMENT. SO THEY HAVE NOT ONLY THE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE ROADS. ALL MODES OF TRANSPORTATION UTILITIES EVERYTHING IS SUPPORTED GOVERNMENTAL WAY AND THIS CONSEQUENCE OF THAT THEY DO HAVE INEQUALITY SOME PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MASERATI SINCE SUMMER DRIVING OLD VOLVOS -- BUT BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT CREATES A GREAT SOLIDITY A FEELING OF HAVING EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF BY THE GOVERNMENT BY THE INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW DID THEY ACHIEVE THAT AND BASICALLY THE GOVERNMENT SUPPLIES FUNDS FOR DOING SO? AND THE I THINK THAT COULD ALSO BE DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHY I LOOK AT THIS -- WE LOOK AT CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S CURRENTLY I THINK EIGHT HUNDRED BILLION IN NEARLY BONDS THE STATE MAY HAVE A HUNDRED BILL YEAH AND AND LOCAL. ENTITIES HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED BILLION THE STATE IS PAYING MATH FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER THIRTY YEARS ON AVERAGE. THE LOCAL ENTITIES ARE PAYING ABOUT TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION A YEAR IN A AND INTEREST COST. OVER AN AVERAGE THIRTY YEAR NEW KNEES -- FROM LOCAL OR FROM PROPERTY TAX AND SALES TAX THEY ALL GO TO THE TOP 2% OF THE POPULATION. WHO ARE SEEKINGTO EVADE OR? ELIMINATE -- PERSONAL INCOME TAX. AND THE THERE IS NO PERSONAL INCOME TAX ON THAT SO BASICALLY -- THE SAME GROUP IT PAYS 50% OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX IS GETTING A BREAK FROM THE MUNICIPAL BOND. ISSUANCE -- THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE COURSE THE BONDS WELL FIRST OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WE KNOW OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS ARE COMING TO A TRILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S BEEN IN THE GOVERNMENT BUDGETS -- THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET OFFICE HAS -- SHOWN THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BE BASICALLY AT HIGHER COST. THE A BONDS NEARLY BONTA USED TO BE 3% ARE GOING TO GO 24% OR MORE. AND SO THE COST IN TERMS OF INTEREST COST IS GOING TO GO UP QUITE A BIT AND WE CAN EXPECT MORTGAGE EVEN MORE DEBT -- PARTICULARLY FROM LOCAL ENTITIES IN THE FUTURE. AND I WAS VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS BECAUSE I FELT THAT. WE REALLY OR TO DO SOMETHING AND HOW DO WE BEGIN TO ADDRESS IT WELL STATE BANK OF COURSE COULD ADDRESS IT -- PRETTY DRESS THE BASIC PROBLEM THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF TAXATION A LOT OF WHAT WE MIGHT CALL REGRESSIVE TAXATION INTERPRETED MUNICIPAL BONDS VERSUS THE PROGRESSIVE TAXATION. OF THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. UP. BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT THING I THINK IS THAT THE PUBLIC BANKS. WHETHER STATE OR LOCAL OR AS I PREFERRED THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE BANK -- IT BASICALLY CUT THE MUNICIPAL BOND INTEREST RATES GREAT DEAL. AND COULD DO SO VERY EASILY -- BASICALLY AND I'LL JUST CUT TO THE END AND I'VE GIVEN A LOT INFORMATION HERE IN MY RIGHT UP. THE KEY POINT IS THAT. THE INTEREST COST WOULD BASICALLY GO THAT MONEY THAT THAT. MUNICIPALITIES PAY IN TERMS OF THEIR PROPERTY TAX AND SALES TAX COULD BASICALLY GO. TO FINANCE THE DIE THE PASTA COSTS BY THE SAME PUBLIC ENTITIES. AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT A PUBLIC BANKS SHOULD ONLY DIRECTLY DEAL WITH PUBLIC ENTITIES WHETHER TO STATE BANK. OR MUNICIPAL BANK -- FOR THE IN THE EXISTING. CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND BANK ALL THE ALL THE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS -- HOMES SO -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING ETCETERA CAN BE DONE THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES RATHER THAN DIRECTLY IT CAN BE DONE THROUGH AS THE HIGH BANK. WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK CURRENTLY DOES THROUGH LOAN GUARANTEES TO SEE DFI BACK OVER TO CREDIT UNIONS THEY DON'T LOAN THE MONEY DIRECTLY AT ALL. A PROVIDE LOAN GUARANTEES TO THOSE WHO DO SO AND I THINK THAT'S THE WAY A PUBLIC BANK SHOULD OPERATE NOT DIRECTLY WITH SMALL BUSINESSES NOT DIRECTLY WITH INDIVIDUALS. BUT THROUGH PUBLIC AGENCIES PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. PUBLIC BANK FOR PUBLIC -- ENTITIES OR BASICALLY ANOTHER TERM LIFE USES A CREDIT UNION FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE UNDERLYING IDEA THAT I'VE GOT FROM MY LIFE IN WISCONSIN WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF CREDIT UNIONS. HOW CAN DO SOME DO SO WELL BASICALLY? WE NEED -- DEPOSITS BIG CHALLENGE AND I PUT THIS DOWN IN THIS RIGHT UP YOU NEED TO POLITICS AND HOW DO YOU GET ALL THAT THE POSITS WELL. THE DAY. THE THE PRIVATE BANKS I DON'T CALL THEN COMMERCIAL BANKS PRIVATE BANKS. OR PROVIDING RELATIVELY. LOW INTEREST PAYMENTS ON SHORT TERM DEPOSITS AND I THINK MANY PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE GETTING HALF A PERCENT. I KNOW SOME OF THE PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS QUITE A BIT LOWER ON SOME OF THEIR SHORT TERM DEPOSITS THERE'S ABOUT TRILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC. PENSION FUNDS IN CALIFORNIA HALF OF THAT IS IN CALPERS AND CAL STARS WHICH RUN THEIR OWN MONEY MANAGEMENT. BUT THE OTHER FIVE HUNDRED BILLION THAT'S OUT THERE. AND 1% OF THAT IS THE SHORT TERM MONEY THAT NEEDS MONEY MANAGEMENT. ARE NOT GETTING ANY INTEREST AT ALL ON AND WAYNE MORRIS WRITTEN A NICE ARTICLE ON THAT SHOWING THAT THE HIGH BANK THE EXISTING AYE BANK WOULD BE A GOOD VEHICLE FOR MANAGING. FOR THOSE FUNDS -- THAT'S ALSO TRUE FOR MANY PUBLIC ENTITIES. I KNOW THAT PUBLIC ENTITIES PUT THEIR MONEY AND WHATEVER BOUGHT A PRIVATE BANK IS AVAILABLE LOCALLY. AND THEN. EVERY DAY OR EVERY WEEK THEY'LL TAKE THE EXCESS RESERVES THAT THEY HAVE THE X. THAT'S DEPOSIT. A SPIN IT OFF INTO A HIGHER RETURN LIKE -- CAMPUS ONE OF THEM THE CALIFORNIA ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AND THEY'LL GET 2% OF TWO AND A HALF PERCENT WITH THEIR EXCESS DEPOSITS OR RESERVES. THE REAL KEY IS TO GET ENOUGH RESERVES FOR THE AYE BANK IN EXISTING AYE BANK. TO MAKE LOANS AND CAN DO THE SICKLY -- INSURING THAT YOU GET VERY GOOD -- RETURNS ON YOUR DEPOSIT. AND THE RETURNS ON THINKING ABOUT IFYOU HAVE A 3% LOAN TO A PRIOR TO A MUNICIPALITY TO LOCAL AND IT A GIFT 2% ACTED THE MUNICIPALITY. AND BASICALLY CHARGE 1% FOR A LOAN INSTEAD OF 4%. THE 1% IS THE COVER OPERATIONAL COSTS OF THE BANK AND ALSO TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT FOR RETAINED EARNINGS TO INCREASE YOUR CAPITAL SHOULD BE CAN DO MORE LINES YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME RETAINED EARNINGS. TO DO TO DO LOANS -- INCREASE YOUR LOAN CAPACITY. SO I THINK THAT COULD BE DONE. WHY WOULD I CHOOSE THE AYE BANK RATHER THAN A NEW BANK TO DO THIS? I THINK BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EXISTING AGENCY YOU HAVE EXISTING STAFF -- YOU HAVE THERE ARE AS WE HEARD FROM KEN STEVENS THEIR EXISTING PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCE PRIVATE BANKERS -- WE CAN EXPAND ON THAT. DAY HAVE A AN ABILITY THEY HAVE TO CONTACT THE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS TO EAT A EVALUATE LOANS. THEY HAVE A ALSO FOR DOING LOAN GUARANTEES TO A VARIETY OF THE EIGHTY ONE C. DFI BANKS IN CALIFORNIA THE TO A VARIETY OF A CREDIT UNIONS PROVIDED THERE OVER IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER THREE YEARS -- SO THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF WAYS OF DIRECTING FUNDS TO ACTUAL USE FOR OTHER THAN THE MUNICIPALITY ITSELF THROUGH THE LOAN GUARANTEES. THE OTHER THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT BY EXPANDING THE AYE BANK IT WOULD TAKE VERY LITTLE TIME YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A BIG TWO YEAR STUDY. AND DO ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO WITH THE NEW BANK BASICALLY YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEAR PERIOD. PROBABLY A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE. AND YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING PUBLIC BANK -- THAT WOULD WORK TO PROVIDE THESE LOANS TO MUNICIPALITIES ESSENTIALLY 1% -- IT WOULD BE CALM THE MONEY MANAGER FOR THE SHORT TERM FUNDS NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY AS MANY BANKS DO THEY SPEND THE SOFTENED ABOUT A QUARTER PERCENT TO MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRMS THAT ACTUALLY DO IT THAT EXPERIENCE THAT MONEY MANAGEMENT. BUT THE NAME ON THE ACCOUNT WOULD BE THE AYE BANK ACCOUNT. SO IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE TO DO THIS THE AYE BANK TODAY HAS REQUEST FOR OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF LOANS THEY ISSUE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION. OF LOANS THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO THE LOAN STATE THE CONDUIT LOANS FOR A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THROUGH MUNICIPAL CHANNELS THEY COULD THEY COULD FUND THOSE -- THOSE STATE AGENCY LOANS THEMSELVES WERE THEY TO BECOME -- A A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SO I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT IN CONTRAST TO ALL OTHER THINGS WE HAVE AN EXISTING AGENCY. FINANCIAL AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW THAT COULD DO THE JOB. IT WOULD BE A SLOW BUILD UP. BUT YOU WOULD HAVE BASICALLY THAT WOULD BE EXPANDING WHICH SHOW YOU HOW. A PUBLIC BANK COULD OPERATE AND SHOW YOU ANY THE DIFFICULTIES YOU HAVE WITH IT AND IT. MAY NOT BECOME THE STATE PUBLIC BANK LITTLE SURE PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR HEALTH BECOME ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH THAT TWO DIFFERENT IDEAS AND MODELS. OF OF WHAT WE COULD IT ENVISION THE FUTURE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE PRESENTERS. SURE. I HAVE A FEW COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS MAKES ME NERVOUS SO -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW PUBLIC AGENCY BANK CAN BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE LARGER COMMERCIAL BANKS THE SPECIAL IN INVESTMENT RETURN RATES. WHO WHO IS THE? ONE ON WHOEVER. I'M I WILL I WILL SAY THAT THE THE INVESTMENT RETURNS FROM -- IF YOU WILL FROM THE NEW NIECE OR AREN'T YOU YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ONE UNIX NONE OF IT COMES BACK TO THE NONE OF IT COMES BACK TO THE ISSUE. GROUP HSA AITCHISON EXPENDITURE. WHEREAS IF YOU IF THE IF THE MUNICIPALITIES ARE INVESTING IN THE AYE BANK THE AYE BANK WILL RETURN. THEIR MONEY BACK THE INTEREST MONEY BACK. TO THE TO THE ENTITY SO IT'S IT'S VERY IT'S VERY PROFITABLY SICKLY YOU GET MUNICIPAL LOANS 41%. VERSUS 4% THAT'S A HUGE SAVINGS IN TERMS OF WHAT A PROPERTY TAX AND SALES TAX. THE THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT'S ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS SOCIAL BENEFIT THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY. AT AM REGION'S HAVING BANKS THAT ARE FINANCING THE SOCIAL PURPOSES FOR LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THERE'S TAKING THE DEPOSITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AN OUT OF STATE BANKS PUTTING THEM INTO A NEW INSTITUTION. AND USING THAT AS A BASE FOR THESE. TYPES OF ACTIVITIES -- COUPLE -- CURSING OF MY CONCERNS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES HAVING TO PROVIDE A DEDICATED FULL TIME STAFF TO CONDUCT SOME OF THESE TASKS THAT WE MIGHT BE ASKING. COMMERCIAL BANKS CHARGE FEES TO PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES IN YOUR OPINION OUR LOCAL AGENTS IS GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF THOSE SERVICES THE COMPETITION. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING IS THAT IF -- I COUNTY OR REGION OR CITY FORMED ITS OWN BANK. IT IS TAKING THE DEPOSITS OF THAT BANK OF THAT AT LOCAL AGENCY. AND IT COULD BE CHARGING FEES FOR THE SERVICES. THAT IS PROVIDING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT IT. THE IDEA OF COMPETITION IN TERMS I'M NOT SURE. AND ARE YOU SAYING COMPETITIVE IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT RETURN THAT THAT LOCAL AGENCY WOULD BE GETTING. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO YOU IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BANK ISN'T JUST INVESTMENT RETURN THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S GETTING IT'S ALL OF THE BENEFICIAL USES OF THOSE DEPOSITS. IN THE COMMUNITY. I I GET THE SO I UNDERSTAND HOW WHERE YOU FOR SEE THIS MAY BE HAPPY AND URBAN AREAS AND HAVING REGIONALISATION FOR BANKS. MY FEAR IS WE ARE VERY BIG STATE. AND HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO HAVE THE STAFFING TO DO THAT. DO THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I'M SITTING OUT HERE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE STATE AND I HEAR. A LOT ABOUT THE LARGEST COMMUNITIES WILL BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF -- BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IS A STATE WIDE ISSUE. SO -- THAT'S WHAT I'M JUST KIND OF GOING THROUGH -- TODAY JUST -- GIVE ART SO THE ALLIANCE INCLUDES RURAL AREAS WE HAVE -- CHAPTERS GOING UP TO EUREKA HUMBOLDT WE HAVE -- MEMBERS HERE WILL GIVE PUBLIC TESTIMONY ABOUT THE WILD FIRES IN THE FACT ON THEM FROM SANTA ROSA AND OUR WE BELIEVE THAT. A CHARTER BASED APPROACH TO THAT PUBLIC BANKING IS A MODULAR FLEXIBLE APPROACH BECAUSE IT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO JOIN FORCES AT A REGIONAL COUNTY OR MULTI COUNTY LEVEL. WHATEVER MAKES SENSE FINANCIALLY TO AT WHAT SCALE IT MAKES SENSE TO PROP UP A BANK. IN SAN FRANCISCO MIGHT BE JUST THE CITY AND COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO BUT IT COULD BE AT A DIFFERENT BANK SERVICE SEVERAL COUNTIES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. CAN LOOK FOR THE OTHER TO TESTIMONY. ANY OTHER QUITE YES [inaudible] CHAIR I I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- WHAT? THE BENEFITS OF DHEA. IDEA PUBLIC BANG SOME MORE PUBLIC BANKS AT THAT WERE YOU. EVENTUALLY SAVE CONSUMERS SO FROM THE HI [inaudible] COST ABA. LOANS CONSUMER LOANS SO MORE BANGS SO WOULD BE BETTER IF MORE PUBLIC BANDS WOULD BE BETTER. THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING IN MY CORRECT [inaudible] THE OKAY FINAL QUESTION THAT A WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT THE IF THIS OF CORRECT THE IDEA THAN. THE UP PUBLICLY. US SUBSIDIZED A GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED PUBLIC BANKS. IN ON MAY PROVIDE LOW INTEREST. TO CONSUME LESS A WHOLE. THEN THE WHAT ABOUT THE NEGATIVE CAUGHT UP CONSEQUENCES TO THE COMMERCIAL EXISTING COMMERCIAL BANKS SO. I COME FROM THE CITY OF OUR BY. AS SO MANY BAGS SO EVEN ONE SHOPPING CENTER THREE FOUR DIFFERENT BANDS. I OFTEN WONDER HOW THE SELF. FIVE IN -- SO IF WE ADD THE MORE PUBLIC VETTING SO WITH A MOLE. TOUR SO FOR THEM TO COMPETE AGAINST A COMMERCIAL BANDS OUT. IT IS THIS IDEA TO KILL THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL BATTLES. SO THAT THE LET ME RESPOND TO BOTH QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS WE THE PRIMARY CUSTOMERS OF THE THANKS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ARE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THEY WOULD BE THE PRIMARY DEPOSITORS IN THESE BANKS. AND THE BANK'S BUSINESS LINES THEIR PRODUCTS -- OUR PROPOSAL. IS THAT WHEREVER THEY'RE DOING RETAIL BANKING. IT IS TO BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT TO THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WORKS WITH REGARD TO IN THE IN IN THE HANDOUT I GAVE YOU IT IT IT SHOWS YOU. THE LOAN PORTFOLIO THOSE LOANS ARE DONE THROUGH LOCAL BANKS. SO THE BANK NORTH DAKOTA -- DOES PARTICIPATION LOANS AND PROVIDES. THE A PARTICIPATION APPROACH SO THE LOCAL BANK PUTS UP SOME CAPITAL FOR THE LOAN AND THE BACK AND WHAT THE COURT ALSO PUTS IN CAPITAL AND YOU LOOK. THERE'S A THERE'S A DIAGRAM ON HOW THAT LOAN TRANSACTION WORKS SO IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE OF TRYING TO KILL THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BRING IT BACK. WE'RE TRYING TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL BANKING SECTOR BY BRINGING THESE. BOMB. THESE LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS THAT WOULD WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WITH WHAT'S REMAINING OF OUR LOCAL BANKING SECTOR. SO WHAT I'M. HEARING IS THAT THE DISTURBIA OR LOCAL AND CITY OR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS -- LENDING OR BORROWING. WOULD BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PUBLIC BANG SAID THAT WOULD WORK WITH THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL BANKS -- AND THEN EVENTUALLY TRANSACTION WILL TAKE COMMERCIAL BANKS YEAH. THAT'S GOOD IN AND THERE'S THIS FLOW CHART SHOWS YOU WHAT WE ENVISIONED THAT'S HOW THE BANK ACT IN NORTH DAKOTA WORKS WITH LOCAL NOW I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE. I JUST A YOU KNOW JUST LISTENING TO YOU READ A LOT OF THIS I I HAVE A LOT OF HOMEWORK TO DO FEDERAL READING TO DO HERE BUT THERE IS A I'M TRYING -- TO SO THAT ALL OF THE SOUL ARE MORE PUBLIC BANKS. THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE CENTURY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED RIGHT. SO. THEY ARE -- LOCALLY OWNED AT THEIR THEIR OWN BY THE LOCAL. GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND AGENCIES SUCH AS A CITIES OKAY DEALING COUNTIES OR JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES. THIS WAS SO SO ARE THE TRY TO EXPLAIN. THAT TO ME AGAIN NOW FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. WITHOUT WITHOUT THOSE PUBLIC BEARING SET THAT UP OWNED BY MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. OF A COMMERCIAL BANG SO WE'RE WE'RE WE HAVE TO CHARGE MORE. SO THAT'S THE REASON PUBLIC BANG SO PUBLICLY ON THE PUBLIC BANG SO WOULD THE BAD A JOB. THE WITHOUT THE PUBLIC BANKS THESE EXISTING SMALL BANKS THE LOCAL BANKS AND WILL BE HEARING FROM SOME. TODAY WOULD NOT HAVE NOTS ARE THE ACCESS TO THE SAME BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY COULD GET IF THEY WERE. IF THERE WAS A LOCAL PUBLIC THANK WORKING WITH THEM TO DO A TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY OR LINES OF CREDIT SO. THE DEPOSITOR IN THE BANK AND THE OWNER OF THE BANK IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WHERE IT DOES ITS BUSINESS IS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IMPARTED IN PARTICIPATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH. THE LOCAL BANKING SECTOR OF THAT COMMUNITY SOME MOST LIKELY OR THE PUBLIC. FUNDS OWNED BY HIS CITY OR COUNTY A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL YOU STAY IN THE PUBLIC BANG ON A DRY UP BY. THE FUNDS SAID THAT ARE DEPOSITED. WELL AT THIS TIME WITH THE COMMERCIAL BANKS WILL PRIMARILY THOSE DEPOSITS ARE GOING TO LARGE OUT OF STATE BANKS WE DON'T -- ENVISIONED THAT THE THE EXISTING DEPOSITS IN LOCAL BANKS WOULD STAY THERE THERE'S NO NEED FOR THE LOCAL BUT FOR CITIES TO WITHDRAW FROM THEIR LOCAL BANKS. THIS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS FACILITY FACILITATING A PATHWAY FOR THEM TO BRING MONEY BACK INTOTHE STATE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN LARGEWALL STREET INSTITUTIONS THAT DO WHERE ARE CITIES AND COUNTIES DO THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BANKING BUSINESS RIGHT NOW. GEN. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I JUST WANT TO SEE IF WE GET A WE HAVE A THIRD PANEL THAT IS GONNA PROBABLY COME UP AS WELL -- BUT I THINK I I I'VE HEARD AT THE SECOND PANEL REYES IS THAT THERE'S TWO CLEARLY DID I MEAN TWO MODELS THAT ARE DISCUSSED HERE BUT MORE MODELS OUTSIDE. OF THIS HEARING ROOM -- ONE MODEL IS TO ALLOW A MUNICPALITY ESTABLISH A CHARTER -- AND AND THERE FOR COULD YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE OUT A OTHER MODEL WE HEARD ABOUT WAS EXPANDING THE AYE BANK FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS -- I EIGHTH I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE SO THAT. AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT THERE IS A FEELING THAT THE TRADITIONAL BANKS -- PRIVATE BANKS ARE NOT. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC OR MUNICIPALITIES IS THAT WHAT RE HEARING AS THE GENESIS -- FOR SOME OF THIS. THERE ARE DISSED YES THERE THERE ARE UNMET NEEDS CURRENTLY IT FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THEM IS PROVIDING ALTERNATE SERVICES TO PAYDAY LENDERS. THAT TO AN UNMET NEED. BRINGING PEOPLE WERE USING PAYDAY LENDERS INTO. THAT BANKING SYSTEM. GOTCHA OKAY WELL I JUST SEE THE I JUST SEE THE COST OF DOING -- EVERYTHING IS VERY HIGH FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS NEEDS AND WERE PLACING A LOT OF THE BURDEN ON THIS. ONE TAXATION. PRETTY TAX USE TAX SALES TAX. IT'S GETTING VERY BURDENSOME I THINK AND WE CAN DO MUCH MUCH MORE AT MUCH LOWER COST IF WE FINANCE IT DIRECTLY THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE BACK WE CAN ALSO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THROUGH LOAN GUARANTEES. THERE ARE THERE ARE AGENCIES AND SEE THE F. BANKS EIGHTY ONE CITY FLA BANKS AND CHRONICALLY DEPRESSED AREAS THERE'S A LOT OF AGENCIES WORKING. THEY CAN PROVIDE LOANS THEY CAN PROVIDE A LOT OF THE SERVICES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCLUDING CHECK CASHING. OF FOR LOCAL AREAS -- BUT THEY CAN DO IT ONLY IF THEY GET LOW LOAN GUARANTEES WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND THERE ARE THEY ARE AVAILABLE NOW BUT TO BE GREATLY EXPANDED. WITH THE EXPANSION OF THE AYE BANK [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND WITH NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THEY THINK WILL TRANSITION TO OUR THIRD -- PANEL THINK YOU BOTH. FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND FEEDBACK. ALRIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS THE THIRD POLICY CONSIDERATIONS PUBLIC PLATE BANKING CA -- PANEL AGREE HAVE JASON LANE VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNOR RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. HONORABLE DâN MIRRORS UP FROM THE TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR FROM YUBA COUNTY. HONORABLE JOSE CISNEROS TREASURER CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND JAMES BECKWITH PRESIDENT CEO OF FIVE STAR BANK. WELCOME GENTLEMEN AND BUT I THINK HAVE JASON LANES START WITH THIS FOR TODAY IF IS THE CLOSE TOGETHER YOU'RE ALL ON TV AT ONE TIME. THANK THE GENTLEMAN FOR ATTENDING TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD. TO LIVE THE CONVERSATION AS WELL -- BROKE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DISTILLING CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND WE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEAK ON IMPORTANT ISSUE. BANKING HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN A VARIETY OF FORMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHAT THE PROPONENTS OF PUBLIC BANK HAVE DISCUSSED THE VIRTUES THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT DISCUSSED ABOUT THE COSTS. AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PUBLIC BANKING -- AND I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME TO DO THAT -- IT IN OUR BELIEF THE RISK AND THE COST DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF A PUBLIC BANK OR DOES OUTWEIGH THE PERCY BENEFIT OF A PUBLIC BANK. CONSIDERING THE WRIST TO THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS LET'S -- TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPLY A ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES CHEAPER THAN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT CONSIDER THAT THE BANKING. SERVICES INDUSTRY SPENDS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON COMPLAINTS COST. TEAMS OF ATTORNEYS IN COMPLIANCE OFFICERS. ARE DEDICATED TO ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO THOSE COSTS WILL DOUBLE. THE NOTION THAT A PUBLIC BANK CAN PERFORM SERVICES CHEAPER IS A MISINFORMED VIEWPOINT. THE TECHNOLOGY ALONE IS A SIGNIFICANT HURDLE. BANKS INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CYBER SECURITY SYSTEMS THE EMPLOYEE ADVANCED ALGORITHMS TO CATCH FRAUD AND PROTECT CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. BANKS HAVE TEAMS OF SECURITY EXPERTS DEDICATED TO STAYING ONE STEP AHEAD OF FRAUD STIRS. AND THESE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED SYSTEMS. STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE BEST TRACK RECORD IT DEPLOYING TECHNOLOGY AND THE TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO SERVICE CALIFORNIA. AS A STATE AND EVEN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS. IS VERY SIGNIFICANT VERY COSTLY AND VERY COMPLEX. THE ADVOCATES BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC BANKS PUBLIC BANKING RESULTS IN MORE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE LENDING -- THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE BANKING ALTERNATIVES THAT PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS WILL NOT -- THEY BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC BANK WILL ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S SOCIAL GOALS MAKE LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES. IT BANKS ARE ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR ACTIVITIES. A PUBLIC BANK WILL SIMILARLY HAVE ALL THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTION. A PUBLIC BANK WITH REGULATORY STRUCTURE DEPOSIT INSURANCE ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL HAVE REGULAR EXAMINATIONS. LIKE A PRIVATE INSTITUTION A PUBLIC BANK WILL HAVE REGULATORS ON SITE SCRUTINIZING THE BANK'S LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE QUALITY OF ITS LOANS AND THE RISK TO THE INSTITUTION. THE BELIEF THAT A PUBLIC BANK FUNDED BY TAXPAYER DOLLARS CAN ENGAGE IN FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES THAT A PRIVATE SECTOR BANK COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T. IS A FAIRLY UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW OF BANKING. PARTICULARLY IF A PUBLIC BANK HAS A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE ENSURING THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTION. FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE IN NETTLETON ONLY THE GOAL OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE PERSPECTIVES ARE LET'S BREAK IT DOWN INTO ITS MOST BASIC TERMS. YOU'RE TAKING REVENUE TAX PAYER REVENUE WHICH INCLUDES PENSION INVESTMENTS YOU'RE MAKING LOANS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE BASED ON POLITICAL PRIORITIES. AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE AN ECONOMIC RECESSION. PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AND THEY WILL DEFAULT ON THEIR LOANS. SO THE QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS THE DOES THE STATE WAR DOES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANT TO PUT ITSELF IN THE ROLE OF DEBT COLLECTOR. IF THE BANK LOSES MONEY AS IT DID IN NORTH DAKOTA FOR TWELVE YEARS BEFORE IT MADE MONEY. WHO BACKSTOPS THAT? IS IT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR STATE GOVERNMENT GENERAL FUND. AND OF SOWHAT HAPPENS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S OTHER PRIORITIES. DOES THE STATE BANK BECOME A FACELESS BUREAUCRACY OR IS IT. ABLE TO SERVE ITS COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY BANK WHICH IS ALREADY WILL INTO THE FABRIC OF THE COMMUNITY. I'D LIKE TO SPEND A MOMENT TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC MAKE MODELS THAT MUCH IS BEEN SAID ABOUT NORTH NORTH DAKOTA AND IT WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS HALF THE SIZE OF PHOENIX IT IS NOWHERE NEAR. THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA -- EAT EGGS IT CAME INTO EXISTENCE BECAUSE THERE WERE NO OTHER BANKS IN NORTH DAKOTA SERVING YEAH COMMUNITY -- THEY RELIED ON OTHER STATE BANKS -- AND THEY WERE CHARGING VERY HIGH INTEREST RATES. BUT THE FACT IS MANY DOUBT THAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA COULD BE FORMED IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY CLIMATE BECAUSE IN. NINETEEN NINETEEN THE REGULATORY UMBRELLA THE CURRENT BANKS OPERATE UNDER DID NOT EXIST. IN AGAIN IT LOST MONEY FOR TWELVE YEARS. IN SPAIN ALL OF THE PUBLIC BANKS HAVE BEEN PRIVATIZED SINCE THE GERMANY THE REGIONAL AND STATE BANKS ARE. FEW AND FAR BETWEEN AND THEY ARE -- VERY STATE OF ON PROFIT THE BUILDING -- IN. A THING WHICH IS BEEN MADE OF THE REGIONAL MODEL IN GERMANY BUT THE REALITY IS THERE NOW CHARGING NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES ON DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND CLOSING BRANCHES. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT THE CB A AND ITS MEMBERS REMAIN DEDICATED TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN CONVERSATIONS TO DISCUSS GAPS OR PERCEIVED MARKET FAILURES BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- WE WANNA FIND SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WE WILL MOVE ON TO THIS IS MY NEXT SPEAKER HERE -- WILL DâN MOUSA FROM A YUBA CITY YUBA COUNTY WILL BE COMING THANK YOU I AM -- PLEASED TO BE HERE SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK. REGARDING PUBLIC BANK POLICY CONSIDERATIONS I'M THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF YUBA COUNTY MUSCLE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR OF FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR'S. CáC TECH AND I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE BOARD DIRECTORS FOR SEER CENTRAL CREDIT UNION -- WANT TO COME HERE TODAY REPRESENTING BOTH THOSE ENTITIES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO TELL ON TO WHAT WE'RE JUST DISCUSSING. AS A FIDUCIARY A PUBLIC FUNDS MY COLLEAGUES ARE INTERESTED PROTECT THOSE FUND. THE TWO MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE CHARGE ASSOCIATION REGARDING PUBLIC FUNDS ARE THE SAFETY AND LIQUIDITY OF THOSE FUNDS. THE RETURN OF THE PRINCIPAL IS MORE IMPORTANT IN THE RETURN ON THE PRINCIPLE. SO THE FIRST TENANT THERE IS A SAFETY IS ADDRESSED TO CLARA BACKSTOPS HIGH CREDIT QUALITY. LIMITED INVESTMENT CHOICES IN VERY LIMITED MAXIMUM TERMS OF REINVESTMENT FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE BONDS INSIDE OF FIVE YEARS OF THE MAJORITY OF WHAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO REINVEST IN. THE SECOND TENANT IS LIQUIDITY TO PUT THAT SIMPLY ITS AVAILABILITY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK RATHER QUICKLY. THE REASON WE HAVE BOTH THESE TENANTS WITH THE BANKRUPTCY OF ORANGE COUNTY IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS -- PERFECTLY LEGAL. ALL COUNTIES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE CHANGED WHAT THEIR GUIDELINES WERE THEREAFTER. SENSE THEM ABOUT A DECADE AGO WE EXPERIENCE THE FINANCIAL GREAT RECESSION. FORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE BACKSTOPS PUT IN PLACE AT THE TIME DUE TO ORANGE COUNTY THE COUNTIES THE CITIES AND LOCAL MISTER POWELL THESE WERE ABLE TO WHETHER THOSE STORMS. BECAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE THE CREDIT QUALITY AND THE COLLATERAL THAT WOULD SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR USE. THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE OUR WITH THE TITLE FUNDS AS THEY ARE DETERMINED THOSE AREN'T CONVERT BUDGETED FUNDS FOR THE LOCAL. MUNICIPALITIES THEIR SPECIAL DISTRICTS THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE OTHER ENTITIES THAT DO DEPOSIT WITH THE COUNTY TREASURER'S THOSE FUNDS ARE ON DEMAND AS THEY ARE NEEDED. ONE OF THE CONCERNS IT'S TREASURES WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE STATE. IS THE GREAT PERFORMANCE RECENTLY BUT HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA OF NATURAL DISASTERS THAT PUTS ANOTHER STRAIN ON TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE FUNDS WHEN FUNDS BECOME NECESSARY. IN GREAT QUANTITIES ON PLANNED EXPENDITURES DO OCCUR WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HONOR THOSE COMMITMENTS FOR THE TAXPAYERS. SO THAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN THAT WE HAD COMING IN I WANT TO TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MR CISNEROS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE GOOD AFTERNOON MR CISNEROS NICE TO SEE YOU. PROJECT AND IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M I'M JOSE CISNEROS THE CHARTER FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M HAPPY TO BE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC BANKING WITH YOU TODAY. ACTUALLY FOR MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS I'VE SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THE HARMS THAT THINK BANKS OF COST PARTICULARLY TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I'VE USED MY VOICE IS TREASURER NOT ONLY TO CRITICIZE BAD PRACTICES. BUT ALSO TO CHANGE THE BANKING LANCE. I WAS FED UP WITHOUT BANKS SYSTEMICALLY PREYED ON LOW INCOME CONSUMERS WITH ABUSIVE OVERDRAFT FEES AND EXCESSIVE UP SELLING. EVEN WORSE EACH OF OUR ON BANKS RESIDENTS WERE SPENDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR ON PREDATORY CHECK CATCHERS. SO I LAUNCH THE BANK ON SAN FRANCISCO PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE EVERY SAN FRANCISCAN HAD ACCESS TO A LOW COST AND APPROPRIATE BANK ACCOUNT. THE BANK I'M PROGRAM PRESSURES BANKS TO CREATE AND MARKET SAFE ACCOUNTS I'M THRILLED THAT A DECADE LATER ANCON. IS A NATION NATIONAL PROGRAM AND THE NEW BANK ON NATIONAL ACCOUNT STANDARDS HAVE SPURRED TWENTY EIGHT BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO OFFER LOW COST. LOW FEE AND NO OVERDRAFT ACCOUNTS TO CONSUMERS. AND WITH THE FOUR LARGEST BANKS OFFERING BANK ON CERTIFIED PRODUCTS TRULY SAFE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE NATIONWIDE. BUT TRUST ME I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT SAFE ACCOUNTS ALONE AREN'T ENOUGH. BIG BANKS SOMETIMES CONTINUE TO DO DAMAGE. THAT'S WHY IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE INCLUDED SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BANKING CRITERIA IN THE SAN FRANCISCO R. F. P. FOR BANKING SERVICES. WE SPECIFICALLYEXCLUDED BANKS WHO OFFERED PREDATORY CONSUMER PRODUCTS LAKE PAYDAY LENDING THROUGH BANK ATMS. I BELIEVE THAT ARE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BANKING REQUIREMENTS ARE A MAJOR REASON WHY WELLS FARGO DECIDED TO WITHDRAW ITS PROPOSAL TO HANDLE OUR CITIES BANKING BUSINESS. FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN I WAS THE FIRST ELECTED OFFICIALS SPEAK OUT AGAINST WELLS FARGO WHEN THEY WERE CAUGHT RED HANDED RIPPING OFF THEIR CUSTOMERS. I IMMEDIATELY KICKED WELLS FARGO OUT OF THE BANK ON SAN FRANCISCO PROGRAM BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT MY CONSTITUENTS COULD TRUST THEM WITH THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY. SO I DEEPLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE WITH MANY IN THIS ROOM WHO ARGUE THAT AT TIMES WALL STREET BANKS HAVE BEEN BAD FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. BAD FOR STATES AND BAD FOR ALL BUT THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS. YET LIKE YOU I AM BOUND BY THE DUTIES AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL PER STATE LAW A COUNTY TREASURER HAS ONE OVERRIDING PRIORITY. TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC FUNDS IN MY CUSTODY REMAIN SECURE AND PROTECTED. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR A FUTURE PUBLIC BANK IS ANY LOSS OF FUNDS WITH A NEED TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT. SO HOW CAN WE AVOID THIS. AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WE SPENT MORE THAN A YEAR IN SAN FRANCISCOCREATING DETAILED OPERATING MODELS FOR MUNICIPAL PUBLIC BANKS. WELL THERE IS A WEALTH OF EXISTING REPORTS THAT DETAIL THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A MUNICIPAL BANK AND OUTLINED REGULATORY HURDLES. THERE ARE NONE THAT SHOW HOW MUCH OF BANQUET COSTS TO START AND RUN AND WHAT LINES OF BUSINESS A BANK SHOULD UNDERTAKE. LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF OUR TASK FORCE WHICH INCLUDED FOLKS LIKETIM SCHAFER FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WHO YOU HEARD FROM EARLIER. SUSHIL JAKE UP FROM THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS WERE YOU ALSO HEARD FROM. CAT TAYLOR FROM THE BENEFICIAL STATE BANK AND PAULINA GONZALEZ FROM THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION. WE DOVE HEAD FIRST INTO THORNY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO BALANCE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY WITH SOCIAL VALUES AND HOW TO CREATE AN INSTITUTION THAT BUILDS UP. RATHER THAN COMPETES WITH OUR EXCELLENT NETWORKS OF CREDIT UNIONS CDF ICE AND COMMUNITY BANKS. BY PARTNERING WITH EXACTLY THESE ORGANIZATIONS A PUBLIC BANK COULD PROVIDE COMMUNITY LOANS ECONOMICALLY AND QUICKLY. OUR SAN FRANCISCO REPORT WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH I PROMISE YOU ALL GET A COPY. AND IT FAIRLY REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS OF WHAT A PUBLIC BANK COULD DO WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY MODELS. FIRST. A LENDING INSTITUTION THAT INVESTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. SECOND A COMMERCIAL BANK THE TAKES OVER THE CORE BANKING SERVICES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY. AND THIRD A HYBRID MODEL THAT DOES BOTH OF THE FIRST. TO I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE SURPRISING THE CREATING A BANK FROM SCRATCH THE CAN SUPPORT THE BANKING NEEDS OF AN OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS CITY WHILE PROVIDING MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY LOANS. IS EXPENSIVE. WE'VE HURT WORKED HARD TO ESTIMATE HOW LARGE A BANK WOULD NEED TO BE TO BREAK EVEN AND NOT LOSE MONEY. AND HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS TO REACH SCALE. THE MORE I DIVE INTO THIS WORK THE MORE I'M CONVINCED THAT THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS ABOUT HOW TO FIND A PUBLIC BANK. AND LIKE LL PUBLIC POLICY CREATING A PUBLIC BANK NECESSARILY MEANS MAKING TRADE OFFS. NO JURISDICTION WHETHER AT THE LOCAL. THE REGIONAL OR THE STATE LEVEL WOULD BE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE PUBLIC BANKS A PUBLIC BANK WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITHOUT TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM OTHER PRIORITIES. LIKE GOVERNMENT SERVICES OR SOCIAL SERVICES. I COMMEND ALL IN THIS ROOM WHO ARE DILIGENTLY TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO REALIZE THIS VISIONARY GOAL. AT THE SAME TIME LIKE MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT ANY CHANGES TO STATE LAWS. THAT WOULD WEAKEN THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THE PUBLIC MONEY WE SAFEGUARD. CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT DETERMINE HOW PUBLIC BANKS KEEP OUR MONEY SAY. PROTECT US ALL FROM THE RISKY PRACTICES THE COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF PUBLIC FUNDS. OR AS DAN MENTIONED EVEN DISASTERS LIKE THE ORANGE COUNTY BANKRUPTCY. I ALSO WANNA ASK THAT AS THESE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE YOU THINK ABOUT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES THAT WILL ALLOW A PUBLIC THANK TO OPERATE AS A SOUND BUSINESS. INDEPENDENT FROM POLITICAL PROCESS AND POLITICAL PRESSURES. THEIR MOMS MOST CERTAINLY BE A CONFLICT BETWEEN FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL GOALS. THAT'S WHY WE THAT'S WHY WE SCENE SOME INTERNATIONALLY POLITICAL PRESSURE HAS IMPAIRED SOMETIMES THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC BANKS. ULTIMATELY BANK GOVERNANCE AND LEADERSHIP MUST FULLY ACCEPT THIS CONFLICT ENSURE THAT A COMMITMENT TO BOTH SOCIAL GOOD AND FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY IS BAKED INTO THE STRUCTURE OF THE BANK. AND THAT ALL OF STAKEHOLDERS ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING THE HARD DECISIONS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE BANK'S ONGOING VIABILITY. WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE JOURNEY THAT SOMEDAY COULD LAUNCH A PUBLIC BANK I'M EXCITED TO BE INVOLVED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TESTIFY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WE WILL NOW HAVE JAMES BECKWITH PRESIDENT CEO OF FIVE STAR BANK WELCOME MR BECKWITH. THANK YOU IN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS AND THANK YOU MEMBERS AND THANK YOU STAFF FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT. WHICH ROLE CONSIDERING RIGHT NOW. BOMB. ON THE COMMUNITY BANKER BEEN DOING THIS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I LOVE WHAT I DO BECAUSE I'M ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH I SERVE. FIVE STAR BANK IS IN ITS TWENTIETH YEAR. WE ARE A UP A COMMUNITY BANK THAT OPERATES WITH FOUR OFFICES IN THE CAPITAL REGION. ONE OFFICE AND UP THE CHICO AND ONE OFFICE AND READING SO WE HAVE BOTH URBAN AND RURAL. OF FOCUS IN TERMS OF OUR CUSTOMERS [inaudible] BUT I'M. DID YOU DID YOU TALK ABOUT THIS PUBLIC BANK MATTER I WANTED TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AS A BANKER. IN IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH THE STATE. IT'S AGENCIES AND ITS PROGRAMS AND HOW BENEFICIAL THEY HAVE BEEN. TO WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF DELIVERING SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- THE A TREASURER MáS SPOKE ABOUT THE STATE'S CD PROGRAM FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKS. THIS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON FOR FIVE STAR BANK WE HAVE WELL OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEPOSITS. FROM THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WE'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE TURN AROUND AND TAKE THOSE DOLLARS AND LINDA BACK IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS LOW INCOME HOUSING. SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. ON IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR FUNDING MIX. IN FACT OF THE TREASURER'S OFFICE OF I THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO PRODUCED A VIDEO ABOUT THE PROGRAM. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ON THAT VIDEO AND WE SPOKE ABOUT THE LOCAL PROJECTS IN WHICH WE FINANCE -- NAMELY. THE A THE BUILD OUT OF THE IT SACRAMENTO FOOD CO OP THE NEW COOPER. IT ALSO BE STREET THEATER -- WE THINK THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS A LOT LEGS IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED -- IN. I'M CONSTANTLY REMINDING MY COLLEAGUES MY COUNTERPARTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ABOUT UTILIZING THAT PROGRAM. NOW THERE HAS TO BE COLLATERALIZED. IT'S DONE IT MARKET RATE SAID THERE'S A THERE'S NO DISCOUNT ANGER BENEFIT IF YOU WILL -- THE TREASURER'S OFFICE -- MAKE SURE THAT AND WE THINK IT'S A FAIR PROGRAM FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAL CAP ITS A VERY VIABLE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM THAT WE THINK HAS. BENEFITED A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE VERY MUCH IN FAVOR SUPPORTING THAT ALSO I BANK AYE BANK IS A SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN CALIFORNIA. LOCALLY WE UTILIZE THE PROGRAM FOR ITS -- IT'S CON TO IT -- BOND FINANCING AND ALSO IT'S GUARANTEE PROGRAM -- IF YOU'RE DRIVING OUT TO THE AIRPORT YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT POWER SCIENCE CENTER. THAT'S AN AYE BANK DEAL. SO IT HAS BEEN A FULL IMPACT. OUR TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AT FIVE STAR ANNA A COLLECTION OF LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS. SAW THE STATE CD PROGRAM AND THOUGHT GEEZ WOULDN'T IT BE INTERESTING IF WE TRY TO EMULATE THAT. WITH THE COVER A COUPLE OTHER PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS HERE LOCALLY. SO WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM CALLED RISE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS FOR A STRONG ECONOMY. AND HERE'S HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS WE TAKE MONIES FROM MINUTES APOLOGIES. IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH COUNTIES. SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND WE TURN AROUND AND WE GUARANTEE THAT WILL LEND IT LEAST 50% OF THOSE MONEYS BACK INTO THE LOCAL MARKET. IT'S PRETTY NEW PROGRAM. PRINCIPALLY IN THE CAPITAL REGION WE HAVE FOUR CITIES AND ONE SPECIAL DISTRICT PARTICIPATING IN A RIGHT NOW. IN AGGREGATE WE'VE. WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION OF DEPOSITS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED WITH LOCAL INSTITUTIONS. THEN WE PLANT OUT PRETTY CLOSE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS BACK IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. WE HAVE A REPORTING SCHEME. ARMS SO THERE'S A LOT OF HIS ABILITY ON THE PROGRAM. IN IT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ELECTED. MAYOR STEINBERG AND ALL THE OTHER BEARS FOR THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT THE PARTICIPATED WHICH ARE ELK GROVE. A RANCHO CORDOVA -- CITY SACRAMENTO IN SMART. SO WE HOPE THAT. THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES ABOUT WHAT CAN BE DONE. WITH PUBLIC FUNDS THROUGH COMMUNITY BANKS AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT IS HAPPENING. ON JUST ONE EXAMPLE. I KNOW THAT MY COUNTERPARTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ARE DOING SAME OR SIMILAR THINGS. SO WHEN WE'RE DISCUSSING A PUBLIC BANK PLEASE DO UNDERSTAND WE ARE LEVERAGING THROUGH COMMUNITY BANKS PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THE BENEFIT IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE SERVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BACK WITH ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS. RESEARCH BY -- CLEARLY ODD THIS PANEL ALL IS OF VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC BATHS. AND NOW WAS THE OP WITHOUT KNOWING. OUR ACTUAL TANKERS UPON A FEW. MY CONCERN WHY LOCAL MAN I MADE COMMENTS -- WHY CAN WE? ENCOURAGE -- UP PROVIDE. SUGGESTIONS EXISTING COMMERCIAL BANKS. OUR FOR THE AREAS -- THAT THEY THEY ARE STE ARE LACKING. RATHER THAN CREATING -- COMPETITION SO WITH THE PUBLIC FUNDS. AND THE JEOPARDIZING -- COMMITTEE BANKS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE CURRENTLY WE HAVE. SOLO. FROM WHAT I HEAR RIGHT NOW CLEARLY. YOU HAVE A DEEPER SIR. IS CRIED DRESS THAT [inaudible] BOB. I SIT ON THE BOARD OF THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION -- EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND ALSO ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANK NETWORK IN. WE'RE HERE TO ENGAGE WITH THE MEMBERS IN THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE HAVE OVERSIGHT WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE WE WANT TO KNOW. HOW WE CAN IMPROVE WHAT WE DO IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FULFILL OUR COMMITMENTS -- UNDER C. R. A BUT NOT JUST THE FILL THEM BUT KILL GO BEYOND. IN TERMS OF HELPING OUR COMMUNITIES GROW TOOK THERE'S A PROGRAMMATIC IDEA THAT BUBBLES UP OUT OF ALL THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY. ON WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. I GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF RICE THAT SAID INNOVATION THAT WE KIND OF CAME UP WITH THAT HELPS OUR OTHER THINGS THAT COME UP. OTHER OTHER POLICY MATTERS WE CAN IMPLEMENT. AND INTO IT UP AND DOWN THE STATE. IN THE URBAN IN IN THE RURAL AREAS. BEFORE YOU JUMP IN NOW CAN I JUST THE AD THE ONE MORE AND ONE ONE OF THE HANDLES IS TO SET THE STATE BACKED THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS A PUBLIC BEN'S SERVING THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS THAT THE ULTIMATE COLDER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PUBLIC GOT BANKS HELLO [inaudible] NO. THE MENU HERE I HAVE WHAT DOCUMENTS. AND WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY UPON -- HEARING THIS THIRD UP PANEL BUT A THINK THE TWO MODELS WE HEARD IN THE SECOND PANEL NEITHER ONE OF THEM DISCUSSED. CANNABIS PER SE AS THE IMPETUS FOR THIS IDEA SO THE REST OF THE MONTH THE HIDDEN GORE. OKAY LET ME HEAR FROM THE GENTLEMAN I INTERRUPTED YOU. OKAY THEM MISTER. MOST WHAT IS THAT THANK YOU AT FROM THE TREASURES PERSPECTIVE AGAIN AS A FIDUCIARY I DIDN'T WANT TO BELABOR -- THE ORANGE COUNTY THE BANKRUPTCY IN THE BECAUSE IS THERE AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THAT IN THE INTEREST OF THE TIME OF THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT I'D BE HAPPY TALK ABOUT IT LEVERAGE IS A MAJOR CONCERN AN ISSUE OF WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT CODE NOW. LOOKS TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S A CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE. WHEN TALKING ABOUT -- PUBLIC BANKS IN LEVERAGING OF THOSE DOLLARS THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS. OF THAT IS MENTIONEDTO CREATE GOOD FOR PUBLIC USING PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS. AND THAT CANNOT BE DISCOUNTED IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS OUT FROM COMMUNITY BANKS REGIONAL BANKS -- AS WELL BUT HOW MANY TIMES CAN THOSE DOLLARS BE LEVERED BEFORE I NEED TO GET MY DOLLAR. BACK WHAT HAPPENS IF I NEED TO UNWIND THAT EARLIER THE UNWIND ITSELF OF THOSE INVESTMENT DOLLARS ULTIMATELY PUBLIC FUNDS IS WHAT LED. TO THE BANKRUPTCY IN ORANGE COUNTY HAD THEY WAITED THIRTY FOUR MORE DAYS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A BANKRUPTCY ANY LONGER. SO THE TIMING IS VERY VERY CRITICAL TO THOSE DOLLARS THE IN MATURITY. THEY USE ITSELF IS WHAT WERE JUDGING THE SAFETY ON BUT THE ABILITY TO GET THAT BACK IS SOMETHING THAT IS EQUALLY CRITICAL TO THE TREASURES THANK. MISLED SOME REALLY MONTH THANK YOU. IN THINKING ABOUT SOME OF AT THE THE IDEAS THAT HAVE COME FORWARD. EIGHT I MEAN WHERE. WHERE DO DO THE BANKS? SEE THEIR ROLE IN CHANGING SOME OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT IS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC SO CLEARLY THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT WORKED FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- WITHIN THE MODELS AND PROGRAMS WE HAVE NOW WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD ABOUT CONCERNS RELATE RELATED TO PREDATORY -- IT YOU KNOW. ASPECTS OF IT -- TO BUT SOMETHING HAS GONE INTO THIS POINT SO CAN WE IT. AS OPPOSED TO ONLY LOOKING AT THE RISK IS THERE ANY SELF REFLECTION AS TO WHY THIS SERVICES AND PRODUCT YOU OFFER AREN'T MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS [inaudible] SELECT YOUR IT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I I DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY THAT IN THIS. COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT WHAT THOSE MARKET PLACE FAILURES ARE BUT WE STAND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE SUPPORTERS OF A PUBLIC BANK TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAPS ARE. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO BE SOLUTIONS ORIENTED WE WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND IF IT MAKES SENSE FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE -- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT WHAT IS THE UNITY TO ME TO ALTER OR AMEND PRACTICES. WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO FIXING IT -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT -- FROM. YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY OPEN OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. A WE DON'T THINK. OF THAT WE HAVE EXIST HAVE IT. EXACTLY RIDER EVER EVEN CLOSE TO THAT GIVEN THIS. WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW A INTERN TO HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK? BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S A LOT OF WILLINGNESS TO YOU KNOW TO CHANGE AND TO IMPROVE. AND I THINK THAT TERM. AS A COMMUNITY BANKER WE LIVE AND BREATHE. THE SUCCESS OF OUR OF OUR FELLOW MEMBERS IN THE COMMUNITY EYES WEEK AS THEY GO WE GO. SO IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAT ZERO IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT'S POSSIBLE WE'VE BEEN UP TO THE LAST TWO WEEKS I'VE BEEN UP THE READING TO TALK ABOUT. THE THE CAR FIRE IN THE RESOLUTION THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TO IMPROVE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND BUILD HOUSING BEEN UP TO CHICO A TO TALK ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE AND ALL OF ITS DEVASTATION THAT'S OCCURRED OVER THERE. WAS OVER IN SANTA ROSA. LAST -- LAST WEEKEND AND DROVE AROUND IN AND WAS PLEASED TO SEE ALL THE BUILDING THAT WAS HAPPENING OVER IN SANTA ROSA. AND A LOT OF THAT'S BEING DRIVEN BY COMMUNITY BANKS AND THEIR EFFORT AND THEIR CAPITAL AND THEIR THEIR THEIR FUNDING -- IN WITHOUT COMMUNITY BANKS ON THEN ARGUE THAT YOU KNOW THAT REBUILD CERTAINLY OF WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR IN IN SANTA ROSA AND AND WHAT'S HAPPENING UP IN REDDING IN CHICO WOULD BE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TASK. THANK YOU I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MEAN THERE AS YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED THERE'S DEFINITELY -- NOT ALL BANKS ARE THE SAME WE KNOW THAT AND AND THE CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT -- ENDS AND SO I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I I THINK THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS. YOU KNOW KIND OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT. SOMETHING WENT WRONG WHEN THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING US TO RETHINK OF A MODEL -- AND SO I WANT TO REFLECT ON THAT. AND IT'S ALSO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR ME. TO UNDERSTAND OBJECTIVES OF WHAT IS WHAT THE END GOAL WOULD BE OF ONE OF THE MANY -- PUBLIC BANK MODELS THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND CERTAINLY THERE'S OTHERS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSED -- AND HAVING A REAL ANALYSIS ON WHETHER THERE ARE ANY REFORMS OR ANY WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITHIN OUR CURRENT STRUCTURE THAT WOULD MEET THE OUTCOMES THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR OR IF. A WHOLE NEW BOTTLE IS IS THAT THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO THROUGH -- AND I THINK THAT THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION AT GIVES US MORE TO THINK ABOUT AT LEAST FOR ME IN TERMS OF THAT TYPE OF THE DISCUSSION. SO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. SO WITH NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS WE HAD WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A MICROPHONE THE MICROPHONE ALREADY IS UP. AND AND WE WILL ALLOW -- WHEN? WE WILL ALLOW FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT TO PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE STATE YOUR NAME. AND AFFILIATION AND YOU'LL HAVE. A MINUTE. TO PROVIDE ANY FEEDBACK OR THOUGHTS. ONE MINUTE YES MA'AM REALLY YOU CAN. WE BELIEVE IN YOU WE CAN DO IT. SHELLEY BROWNING FRIENDS A PUBLIC BANKING CENTER IS ALSO WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE. SANTA ROSA FOR THE FACT PAST FIFTEEN YEARS BANK THAT WELLS FARGO LAST YEAR THEY PUT OUT AN RFP FOR NEW BANK TO THE CRA. RATING BEING DOWNGRADED TO NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR FEE ANNUALLY FOR THE SERVICES. THEY INVEST THREE AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY THEIR WITHIN PART OF THOSE IN TWENTY BANKS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY FIFTEEN OF THOSE ARE AMONG THE TOP TOP FINANCIERS OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. THE CITY IS -- THEY ARE DOWN FIFTEEN MILLION IN THEIR BUDGET FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR LARGELY IN PART BECAUSE OF THE FIRES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES ARE MUCH GREATER. THREAT TO THIS CITY THEN BACK TO THE FIRE WHICH IS OUR STATE OF BY OUR CFO -- CURRENTLY THERE ARE FIFTY JOBS OPEN IN CITY DEPARTMENTS SEVEN FIREFIGHTERS WHICH ARE NOT GOING TO BE FILLED BECAUSE THE CITY IS NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THEM. NOR DO THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THEIR PENSIONS WHEN THEY RETIRE STATED BY OUR CFO -- OUR FIRE PARTY OR RECENTLY STATED THAT IF BUYERS NOW OCCUR IN OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SANTA ROSA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND FIREFIGHTERS TO ASSIST BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. TO DO IT. WITH REGARD TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AFTER THE FIRES FIVE THOUSAND HOMES PER DOWN A HUNDRED FIFTY HAVE BEEN REBUILT THUS FAR. IN ESSENCE WHAT WE AS THE CALIFORNIA PUTTING HIM LINES ARE ASKING THAT YOU GUYS THAT THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT BEGINS ISSUE THIS LICENSE SO THAT CITIES CAN COME FORWARD. AND CLAIM CONTROL OF THEIR OWN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS WE HAVE A ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION INVESTED IN LOCAL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS OF OUR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE FDIC INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS AND THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT COULD BE WAY TOO WITHIN THE NEW LICENSURE BECAUSE THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA IS NOT FDIC INSURED THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRS -- TREE KID -- BICU COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR -- I'VE REACHED NEW TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR ACTUALLY I WORKED IN BANKING FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS -- ONE THING I WANT TO MENTION IS -- IN BICU COUNTY OFFICE YOU WERE DEALING WITH THE DISASTER RECOVERY. FROM THE CAMPFIRE -- SO LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL -- A WORLD THE COUNTY'S KERR EXPENSE FROM FEMA AND CAL -- YES. ALL RIGHT SO HAVING THAT LIQUIDITY -- FOR OVERNIGHT FUNDS IS CRITICAL. NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALSO GETTING A RATE OF RETURN ON THOSE FUNDS -- SAFETY IS CRITICAL -- THE ONE THING I WANT TO BRING UP THAT THE WASN'T TALKED A LOT IN THESE SESSIONS WAS COLLATERAL. THE COSTA COLLATERAL HAS BEEN -- ASTRONOMICAL AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S PUSHED A LOT OF BANKS. OUT OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR BANKING BECAUSE OF THE COSTS OF COLLATERAL. SO THAT'S KIND OF A PIECE OF THAT. THAT WE CAN ONLY TOUCH ON TODAY -- AND THAT'S TRULY -- BEEN CHALLENGING FOR A LOT OF THE MEDIUM TO SMALL SIZE BANKS IS COMPETING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR BECAUSE OF ACOSTA COLLATERAL -- YOUR THING I WOULD MENTION IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT COMMERCIAL BANKING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WIRE TRANSFERS. A CH INFORMATION REPORTING LOCK BOX ON A ONLINE PLATFORM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A GREAT DEAL OF CAPITAL NEEDS TO SUPPORT THAT -- THE GERMAN FROM THE OTHER COMPANY MAKES CESSATION MENTIONED YOU KNOW JUST THE COST. TO OFFER FRAUD PROTECTION IN ONLINE MAKING ALL THAT SORT OF THING IS. IT'S I WOULD COMPARE IT TO TRY TO COMPETE AGAINST DISNEYLAND AS A THEME PARK CREATING A THEME PARK. IN TRYING TO COMPETE AGAINST DISNEYLAND YOU YOU BETTER HAVE A LOT OF CAPITAL IN SOME DEEP POCKETS -- GIVING I WOULD SAY IS -- WE EITHER HAVE SOME OTHER STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS DIEM V.. AND D. W. ARE AND AND WE WE KIND OF WHAT THE HELL'S AGENCIES OPERATE. SO THANK YOU. HELLO MADAM CHAIR IS MY NAME IS DOUG NORRLAND I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE ECONOMIC POLICY PROGRAM. AT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH UNITED STATES. OF FRIENDS HERE IT IS IN SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION MEMBERS HERE IN THE US. AND WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF PUBLIC BANKING FOR THE REASONS STATED BY OUR COLLEAGUES. OF THE SOCIAL REASONS THAN YOU KNOW PAYDAY LENDERS THAT NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE'S ALSO A BIG CLIMATE CHANGE CONNECTION AS SUSHIL JACOB HAS MENTIONED I MEAN WERE NO. STRANGERS HERE TO THAT DEVASTATING IMPACTS. OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- WE SEE IT EVERY YEAR IT'S GETTING WORSE AND OUR STATE -- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS CITIES ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ONE EXAMPLE IS CITIES HAVE BEEN JOINING. A NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS TO TRY TO PRESSURE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE MAYOR SO STATIONS OF MAYORS ARE ARE PRESSURING. THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO MORE AND THEY'RE TRYING TO DO MORE THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR OWN CITIES. AND YET THEY'RE VERY FUNDS THEIR DEPOSITS IN THE ARE FUNDING THE VERY THING CAUSING THE CLIMATE CHANGE. MASSIVE EXPANSION OF FOSSIL FUEL PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD WHICH IS INCREASING GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATION. CAUSING THE VERY PROBLEMS WERE SAYING SO ON THE ONE HAND WHERE WERE YOU KNOW SOCK IT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR INACTION AND AT THE SAME TIME. WERE SECOND TO OURSELVES BY FINANCING THE VERY THING. THAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND SO WE SEE PUBLIC BANKING AS A SOLUTION TO THAT AS A WAY. TO EXPAND THE DIVESTITURE MOVEMENT AWAY FROM. WALL STREET BANKS AND REINVESTED IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO HELP REBUILD AFTER THE DEVASTATION. CAUSED BY WILDFIRES AND OTHER FORMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEBBIE NOT CAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE I JUST WANT. TO AFTER THANKING THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE CALIFORNIA BANKING ASSOCIATION FOR HIS REMARKS. SAY THAT I MISSED THREE CRUCIAL WORDS. ONE IS PROFITS. ONE THE SHAREHOLDERS AND ONE IS FINE. IF THE CALIFORNIA IF THE BANKING REGULATION IS AS GOOD AS IT IS WHY HAS WELL FARGO HAD TO PAY THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FINES FOR ITS ACTIVELY FRAUD YOU DOESN'T THAT MONEY COME BACK TO US. THANK YOU. CLIFFORD JOHNSON JUST A MYSELF. I JUST WANT TO PUT ONE HISTORICAL. PERSPECTIVE ON THIS IS ALWAYS BEEN THE TENSION BETWEEN PUBLIC MONEY AND PRIVATE MONEY. KNEE GOES BACK. TO HAVE A A BIG CONFRONTATION ABRAHAM LINCOLN INTRODUCED HIS ORIGINAL GREEN BACK DOLLARS THE BANKERS SAID YOU COME DO IT IT WON'T WORK. BUT HE DID IT HE VETOED A BANK BILL IT SAID NGUYEN STOP PUBLISHING OUR OWN MONEY. AND NOT VETO RESULT HITTING WINNING THE CIVIL WILL THE IS OF WILL IS GOING ON BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AND LET'S HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. AND HAVE BOTH [inaudible] THANK YOU. SEE NO A DIVISIONAL THERE'S ONE MORE. SORRY. THE CLIFFORD UNDERSTATED HE'S WITH THE PUBLIC BANKING INSTITUTE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. PROMOTING PUBLIC BANKS. I'M WITH US THE EAST BAY PUBLIC BANK WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE. OF MY NAME IS SUSAN HARMAN -- I THINK DOUG MENTIONED DIVESTMENT WHICH IS A MAJOR REASON -- FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ENGAGE IN PUBLIC BANKING. OF AT THE PHRASE CURRENTLY IS TO DISRUPT THE CURRENT BANKING SYSTEM AND IF WE ALL THINK THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA -- MR CHOI OF SEEMS TO THINK THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WAS WILL SUBSIDIZE THESE BANKS THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN FACT IT'S THE OPPOSITE. WE EXPECT THESE BANKS TO MAKE A PROFIT THAT WILL GO BACK INTO THE GENERAL FUNDS OF THE LOCALITIES -- THEY WILL NOT BE RUN BY GOVERNMENTS THEY WILL NOT BE UNDER POLITICAL INFLUENCE THEY WILL HAVE INDEPENDENT BOARDS. OF PRIMARILY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND CITIZENS AND BANKERS. AND WE'RE AWARE THAT THERE'S A TENSION. BETWEEN FIFTH FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL GOOD AND THAT WILL THAT IS PART OF ALL OF THE BANKS THAT WE'RE ENGAGED WITH ALL OF OUR MISSIONS -- RECOGNIZE THAT TENSION AND WE'LL DEAL WITH IT IT WILL BE A PROBLEM IT WILL BE DIFFICULT BUT MANAGEABLE. A PROFIT IS NOT OUR ONLY GOAL IT IS NOT OUR BOTTOM LINE -- AND MR BECKWITH TALKED ABOUT A PROGRAM CALLED RISE WHICH I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH BUT WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A MINI EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF COLLABORATION AND MUTUAL HELP THAT. PUBLIC BANKS WILL BE ABLE -- TO INSTITUTE WITH COMMUNITY BANKS SO IT IT'S AN EXAMPLE THAT WE NEED TO FIND MORE OUT MORE ABOUT. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS. IS HEARING THIS WAS WONDERFUL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS MARGIE LEWIS AND I TO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA BANKING ALLIANCE. AND I JUST WANTED TO OF TO LITTLE BIT ON WHAT SUSAN SAID IS THAT HAVING A MUNICIPAL BANK AS AN ENTITY. WILL BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE CAPITAL FOR THE COMMUNITY BANKS THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ON THEIR OWN THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO GIVE. MAY BE A LOAN THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR OR THAT'S A LITTLE MORE RISKY AND THE REASON WE BE ABLE TO DO IT. IS BECAUSE WE WILL NOT SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE WE ARE THE SHAREHOLDERS WE WILL NOT BE PROVIDING FOR THE MULTI MILLION DOLLAR BONUSES AND GOLDEN PARACHUTES. OF THE CEOS HERE WILL HAVE A CDL BUT THEY WILL NOT BE MAKING THREE HUNDRED TIMES WHAT. THE AVERAGE BANK WORKER WELL SO THAT IS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE THAT TYPE OF PROFIT MOTIVE THE PROFIT MOTIVE IS TO MAKE PROFIT TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY. NOT TO GO INTO THE GOLDEN OF LAID POOLS OF THE CEOS AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS. THE PUBLIC BANKS IN GERMANY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL I AM SORRY HIS COMMENT WAS NOT CORRECT THEY'VE BEEN LOSING MONEY AND THEY HAVE BEEN FUNDING. THE GREEN ECONOMY THAT IS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN GERMANY TODAY THANK YOU AND I THIS IS A WONDERFUL HEARING I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. HI -- I'M SOVIET SHE ALSO FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BANKING ALLIANCE AND PUBLIC BANK EAST BAY -- AND I WANT TO ALSO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING -- AND FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID -- OF THE WORK THAT MR BECKWITH WAS DESCRIBING -- THAT IS THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE WANT TO INCREASE THAT WE WANT TO DO MORE OF AND USE PUBLIC BANKS AS A MULTIPLIER TO INCREASE THAT LEVERAGE SO THAT WE INVEST MORE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA DOES RIGHT NOW -- MISTER LANE FROM THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION SAID THAT HE WAS OPEN TO DIALOGUE ABOUT THE PERCEIVED MARKET FAILURES AND UNMET NEEDS IN THE BANKING. SYSTEM SECTOR. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE HIM UP ON THAT OFFER IN A PUBLIC FORUM -- ONE UNMET NEED THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS THE DIVESTMENT MEAT AND MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PASSED RESOLUTIONS. STATING THAT THEY YOU KNOW WANT TO DIVEST FROM FOSSIL FUELS OR FROM SPECIFIC PROJECTS LIKE THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE. WHICH MILEY INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY. AND THE BANKS THAT ARE PROVIDING THEM THEIR BANKING SERVICES HAVE NOT PROVIDED. THE SERVICE THEY WANT WHICH IS A IN TERMS OF DIVESTING FROM THOSE PROJECTS -- AND IN FACT OR IT ACTIVELY EXACERBATING CLIMATE CHANGE CHAOS BY LEVERAGING PUBLIC MONEY TO DO SO -- SO. YES SO THE FOSSIL FUELS AND WITH A THIRD IN THE BANKS THAT FINANCE THEM HAVE NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO CALIFORNIANS OR THEIR PUBLIC DEPOSITORS. SO WE THINK THAT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT PUBLIC BANKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THANKS. I THINK WE ARE DONE WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I'M GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBERS CERVANTES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW AND SO AS WE EXAMINE THE CREATION OF A STATE BANK I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS -- FOR BOTH SIDES THAT I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING AS WE MOVE. CORD AND CONTINUE DISCUSSING THIS TOPIC THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST I TO MANY OF US -- BUT FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING AND AND BEING ACTIVE -- IT JUST BEING ENGAGED IN AT THIS POINT IN TIME [inaudible] THANK YOU -- ON JUST QUICKLY TO US THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING TODAY I THINK IT WAS A LIFE GOOD DISCUSSION -- MY INTEREST IS WOULD BE IS COULDN'T CONTINUE THE COLLABORATION CONTINUE THE OPEN DIALOGUE -- THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. NOW. LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER BUT THERE'S WITHIN THE ROOM HERE THAT HAVE COMMITTED TO MOVING AND LOOKING INTO THIS. INTO PUBLIC BANKS AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT -- NO MATTER WHAT SIDE A LOT OF THE WHAT I'LL YEAR ON I THINK YOU WORK ON THIS SO I CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ENGAGED. OUT AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ALL AS A TEAM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL ATTENDING TODAY. AND I WANT TO AND I THINK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS ALL OF THE PRESENTERS AT AS WELL AS WELL AS THAT BANKING AND FINANCE TEAM AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TEAMS -- FOR FOR GATHERING ALL THE INFORMATION AND THE SPEAKERS I THINK WE'VE HEARD -- A START OF A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN HAD VERY PUBLICLY -- BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD A RECENT CONVERSATION -- A IN A FORMAL SPACE IN THE IN SACRAMENTO THE CAPITAL SAY THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING. A LOT OF US ARE HEARING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY -- TO SACRAMENTO TO THE CAPITAL TO HOPEFULLY THINK OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE -- SOME OF MY TAKE AWAYS FROM TODAY'S HERE FRONT MODELS OUT THERE AND THAT WERE NOT -- COALESCING AROUND ONE MODEL PER SE -- AND CERTAINLY THEY'RE STILL I THINK A LOT OF PIECES -- THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE RISKS TO THE PUBLIC AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AS WELL AS REALLY EVALUATING -- AND HAVING A PUBLIC SAY ON WHETHER THAT RISK IS A MATTER YOU KNOW WORTHY AND IT WHETHER IT MERITS CONSIDERATION GIVEN ALL OTHER RISKS THAT WE TAKE -- WITH ANY TYPE OF PRIVATE OR COMMERCIAL SO I HOPE THAT -- WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS OUT ONE OF THE PIECES THAT IS IS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I FIND MOST FASCINATING AND AND DIFFICULT. IS NOT ANSWERING THE EASY QUESTIONS BUT ANSWERING THE HARD QUESTIONS THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT PUT US ALL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT DO WE DO -- WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC EVERYTHING THAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY? HAS A TRADE OFF OF SORTS AND SO DISCUSSING WHAT THOSE TRADE OFFS WOULD LOOK LIKE TO THE PUBLIC -- IS IMPORTANT IT DOESN'T MEAN WE DO OR WE DON'T DO THINGS -- IT JUST MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO HAVE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT ARE NEEDED -- IN ORDER TO CONSIDER WHAT NEXT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT TO AT THE WILL CONTINUE. SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING AND FOR BEING PART OF THIS DISCUSSION FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE AND WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE THE HEARING [inaudible] SORRY
