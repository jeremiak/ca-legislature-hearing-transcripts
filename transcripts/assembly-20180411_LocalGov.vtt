ABEYANCE FOR A CHARTER CITIES.

00:38:12.924 --> 00:38:16.060 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS AGO IN THE CITY OF

00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:17.662 region:rollup2
OAKLAND THE CITY CLAIMS THAT

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.997 region:rollup2
LAND BEING OFFERED FOR SALE TO A

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:20.665 region:rollup2
PRIVATE DEVELOPER OF MARKET RATE

00:38:18.997 --> 00:38:22.200 region:rollup2
HOUSING WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.767 region:rollup2
SURPLUS LAND ACT BECAUSE IT WAS

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.969 region:rollup2
FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:26.404 region:rollup2
LAND.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.739 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:30.341 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSFER OF

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:32.510 region:rollup2
THE PROPERTY FROM THE CITY TO

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:33.812 region:rollup2

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.113 region:rollup2
WAS INVALID AND D. O. F. WAS

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:37.549 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ORDERING THAT IT BE

00:38:35.113 --> 00:38:38.716 region:rollup2
CLAWED BACK. AND THEREFORE WAS

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:40.018 region:rollup2
CLEARLY CITY OWNED PLANT.

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:41.553 region:rollup2
MORE RECENTLY THE CITY OF

00:38:40.018 --> 00:38:42.854 region:rollup2
OAKLAND CLAIMS THAT A CITY OWNED

PARCEL BEING OFFERED TO A

00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:46.925 region:rollup2
PRIVATE DEVELOPER WAS NOT

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:48.326 region:rollup2
SURPLUS LAND BECAUSE THE CURRENT

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:49.994 region:rollup2
STATUTORY LANGUAGE REFERS TO

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:52.363 region:rollup2
LAND THAT IS QUOTE. DETERMINES%

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:53.665 region:rollup2
TO BE NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:55.066 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES USE.

00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:56.568 region:rollup2
THE CITY CLAIMED THAT SINCE IT

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:58.770 region:rollup2
HAD NEVER USED TO PLANT IT

00:38:56.568 --> 00:39:00.572 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FIT THE TEST OF NO LONGER

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.472 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR THE CITY'S USE AND

00:39:00.572 --> 00:39:03.675 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THERE WAS NO

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION TO GO THROUGH THE ON.

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.411 region:rollup2

TRANSIT AGENCIES SEEKING

DISPOSABLE LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.917 region:rollup2
OF CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE FEDERAL

TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IN STATE

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:17.388 region:rollup2
LAW DEFINED JOINT DEVELOPMENT AS

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:19.490 region:rollup2
A TRANSIT RELATED USE SUCH

00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:21.860 region:rollup2
DISPOSITION STILL QUALIFIES AS

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:23.695 region:rollup2
BEING USED BY THE AGENCY AND

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.697 region:rollup2
THEREFORE. DEVELOPMENT OF OFFICE

00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:27.165 region:rollup2
AND RETAIL SPACE FOR EXAMPLE IS

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:28.266 region:rollup2
PERMITTED WITHOUT NEEDING TO GO

00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:31.936 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCEDURES OF THE

PLUS LAND ACT.

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:36.174 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN EFFORTS TO DEFINE

00:39:34.072 --> 00:39:38.610 region:rollup2
SALE OF WAY ON FOR ANY BROADLY

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:40.645 region:rollup2

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR REVENUE

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:44.315 region:rollup2

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:46.084 region:rollup2
LAND.

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:48.219 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION ABOUT

00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:49.621 region:rollup2
WHAT IT MEANS TO GIVE PRIORITY

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:51.089 region:rollup2
TO PROPOSALS FOR AFFORDABLE

00:39:49.621 --> 00:39:52.890 region:rollup2
HOUSING TO ASSIST MEAN THAT IN

00:39:51.089 --> 00:39:55.093 region:rollup2
AGENCIES SHOULD FIRST NEGOTIATE

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:57.095 region:rollup2
EXCLUSIVELY WITH DEVELOPERS

00:39:55.093 --> 00:39:58.596 region:rollup2
PROPOSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR

00:39:57.095 --> 00:40:00.098 region:rollup2
JUST AT THE CITY IN THE COURSE

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:01.933 region:rollup2

COUPLE OF EXTRA POINTS TO

HOUSING.

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:08.373 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY WE'VE SEEN ATTEMPTS

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:10.975 region:rollup2
TO USE THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS

00:40:08.373 --> 00:40:13.578 region:rollup2
ITSELF TO DIRECT OR LIMIT THE.

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:15.580 region:rollup2
FINAL USE OF THE LAND.

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:17.682 region:rollup2
INCLUDING SAYING WELL WE ONLY

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.149 region:rollup2

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:22.053 region:rollup2
RETAIL DEVELOPMENT HERE DESPITE

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.454 region:rollup2
THE STATUTE CLEARLY STATING THAT

00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:25.556 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION SHOULD FOCUS ON

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:27.025 region:rollup2
SALES PRICE OR LEASE TERMS AND

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:28.726 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS FAILURE TO REACH

00:40:27.025 --> 00:40:30.128 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT ON THESE POINTS THAT

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:31.562 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW THE AGENCY TO THEN

00:40:30.128 --> 00:40:32.897 region:rollup2
PROCEED. WITH SALE TO OTHER

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:33.998 region:rollup2
ENTITIES.

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:35.199 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THIS

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:36.901 region:rollup2

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:38.503 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING IN RESOLVING THESE

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:40.405 region:rollup2
AMBIGUITIES AND LOOPHOLES AND

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:41.439 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD.

00:40:40.405 --> 00:40:44.242 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CLARITY ABOUT WHICH

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:46.144 region:rollup2
AGENCIES ARE COVERED BY THE LAW.

00:40:44.242 --> 00:40:48.246 region:rollup2
BETTER DEFINE SURPLUS LAND AS

00:40:46.144 --> 00:40:49.547 region:rollup2
ANY PUBLICLY OWNED PLANTS NOT

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:52.583 region:rollup2

OWN GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS AND

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.586 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A PRESUMPTION THAT

PUBLIC LAND IS SURPLUS PROPERTY

00:40:55.586 --> 00:41:00.658 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PUBLIC ENTITY INITIATES

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:01.626 region:rollup2
ACTION TO DISPOSE OF IT.

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:03.995 region:rollup2

LAND MAKING THAT PROCESS EASIER

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:12.370 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH DEVELOPERS AND PUBLIC

TRACK THIS. ON THE BILL PROPOSES

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:37.261 region:rollup2
INSTEAD TO HAVE A CENTRAL

00:41:40.465 --> 00:41:42.633 region:rollup2
CENTRAL REPOSITORY.

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:45.403 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD SPECIFY THAT

NEGOTIATION SHOULD FOCUS ON SALE

00:41:45.403 --> 00:41:48.840 region:rollup2

00:41:50.441 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
WOULD I CLARIFY WHAT IT MEANS TO

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.326 region:rollup2
THE ARM.

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:08.960 region:rollup2
BILL NOW WOULD CLARIFY THAT IF

00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:09.794 region:rollup2
NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSALS

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.263 region:rollup2
THAT COME FORWARD BUT THE

00:42:09.794 --> 00:42:13.564 region:rollup2
PROPERTY IS SUBSEQUENTLY

00:42:12.263 --> 00:42:14.699 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED FOR HOUSING THAN THAT

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:16.567 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REPLY.

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:18.102 region:rollup2

ONLY TEN SERVICE CONNECTIONS A

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:34.042 region:rollup2
COMPLETE ELECTION WOULD BE.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.378 region:rollup2
NEEDED BEFORE THE SYSTEM COULD

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:38.447 region:rollup2
BE SOLD WHILE THE COST TO HOLD

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:41.183 region:rollup2
AN ELECTION ON MAY NOT BE

01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:42.184 region:rollup2

ONCE THE GOLD LINE FINISHES

THEM. IS THAT WE THINK THAT THE

01:34:40.275 --> 01:34:44.746 region:rollup2

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:46.147 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION

01:34:44.746 --> 01:34:46.981 region:rollup2
TO ASSEMBLE MEDINA COUNTY.

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:48.483 region:rollup2
THE GOLD MINE CURRENTLY HAS FIVE

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:51.486 region:rollup2
VOTING MEMBERS

01:34:48.483 --> 01:34:54.155 region:rollup2
AND FOR NON VOTING MEMBERS.

01:34:51.486 --> 01:34:55.790 region:rollup2
WITH THE EXTENSION TO MONTCLAIR

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:58.226 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE PROJECT

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:59.661 region:rollup2
IN SYMBOL MEDINA WILL BE SIX

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:01.729 region:rollup2

01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:04.832 region:rollup2
HOWEVER ONE OF THE.

VOTING MEMBERS CURRENTLY IS FROM

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:09.003 region:rollup2
SIMBA MEDINA COUNTY SO THEY'VE

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:10.872 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY GOT TODAY THE TWENTY

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:13.408 region:rollup2
PERCENT VOTE ON THE BOARD. THIS

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:14.876 region:rollup2
WOULD INCREASE THAT THIRTY THREE

01:35:13.408 --> 01:35:16.978 region:rollup2
PERCENT ON THE BOARD.

01:35:14.876 --> 01:35:19.647 region:rollup2

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:23.017 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THE GOLD LINES

01:35:21.683 --> 01:35:23.851 region:rollup2
DONE A GOOD JOB OF REPRESENTING

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.653 region:rollup2

MENTIONED.

01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:34.462 region:rollup2
ALSO WE FEEL THAT THE BILL

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:35.396 region:rollup2
COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE SOME
