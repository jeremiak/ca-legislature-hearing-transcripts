00:06:59.385 --> 00:07:00.853
THAT'S WE DO THAT BY PROVIDING

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.688
SERVICES THOSE KIDS UP FRONT.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.957
AND EARLY ON. A LOT OF COUNTIES

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:05.558
HAVE WHAT THEY CALL A

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:07.260
DIFFERENCE RESPONSE. PROGRAM

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.327
WHERE THEY'RE DEALING WITH

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:09.796
FAMILIES BEFORE THERE'S GOING

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.864
TO BE NEED TO REMOVE A CHILD.

00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:12.999
THAT'S THE BEST OUTCOME AND I

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:14.734
THINK. THAT'S WHAT THE

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.536
OPPOSITION'S REALLY POINTING TO

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.371
OR BETTER OUTCOMES FOR KIDS

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:19.806
HAPPEN IF WE NEVER HAVE TO

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:21.507
BRING THEM. INTOA SYSTEM THAT

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:25.244
DOES PROVE TO BE DIFFICULT FOR

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:25.812
A LOT OF THE KIDS THAT ENTER

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:26.612
INTO IT. BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:28.047
BENEFITS AND WE WANT TO MAKE

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.750
SURE. THAT DECISIONS IN THE

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.218
LEGAL SYSTEM ARE BEING MADE TO

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.319
APPROPRIATELY. ABOUT THAT

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.620
CHILD. AND THAT THEY WILL

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:36.689
ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO THE

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.790
BENEFITS OF THE DEPENDENCY

00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:40.059
SYSTEM. EVEN AS WE WORK TO

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.594
IMPROVE THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM.

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.963
AND GET THOSE BENEFITS LONG

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.431
TERM AND NOT UNNECESSARILY

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.766
EXCLUDED FROM THINGS I CAN GAP

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.335
IN OTHERS. WHERE THEY WOULD

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:51.838
HAVE SOME LEG UP AS THEY AGE

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.105
OUT OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT'S

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:54.640
REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.342
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.177

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.319
THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM EVEN WITH

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.453
SOME OF THE CHALLENGE THEY NEED

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.321
TO BE MADE WHAT WE'RE JUST

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:09.922
TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE THAT.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.358

OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES- WHAT WE

CHILD AFTER. AN INJURY HAS

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:04.489
OCCURRED- NOW THERE ARE MANY

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:06.491
REASONS WHY I POINT IF IN ANY

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:09.093
CASE- WE MIGHT SEE ARBITRATION

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.062
AS- A DESIRABLE OPTION IT CAN

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:13.564
BE LESS EXPENSIVE FASTER- MORE

PRIVATE. HOWEVER THERE ARE

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:19.037

REQUIRED TO ATTEND THE SCHOOL.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:43.461
SECONDLY CHILDHOOD SEXUAL

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.129
ASSAULT IS NOT A FORESEEABLE

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:47.265
CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN ROLLING IN

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:49.233

BUT- IT'S- ON THE FORESEEABLE

00:32:57.608 --> 00:33:00.478
AT THAT MOMENT. FOR A PARENT TO

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:02.213
BELIEVE THAT A CHILDHOOD SEXUAL

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.182
ASSAULT WOULD BE PART OF THE

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:06.384
CHILD'S EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

AND SO. THIS BILL CLARIFIES

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:10.188
THAT REQUIRING A VICTIM OF

NECESSARY IS THAT CAL AND IT IS

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.577
ALLOWABLE UNDER- THAT PRESIDENT

00:33:32.643 --> 00:33:33.978
IS THAT CALIFORNIA LAW IS CLEAR

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.947

MINOR IN THE FEDERAL

THE CHOICE OF FORUM- AS

ARBITRATION. AND THIS IS THERE

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.214

EXPOSED TO SEXUAL PREDATORS IN

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.153
OUR SCHOOL. AMONG THE MANY OF

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.288
THE TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED THAT

00:37:37.355 --> 00:37:38.656
MANY WORKING FOR THIS ISSUE IF

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.358
YOU NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.692
AND THE CURRENT ARBITRATION

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:43.928
WILL HELP KEEP IT IN THE DARK.

00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:44.762
THERE ARE FEW THINGS WORSE THAN

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.530
HARMING A CHILD ONE THING IS

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:47.898
PREVENTING THAT SHOP IN SEEKING

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.400
JUSTICE FOR THAT HARM SIMPLY

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.469
IGNORING THAT IT EVER HAPPENED.

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.737
FOUR YEARS AGO OUR CHILD'S

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.171

EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:00.611
THE PERPETRATOR WAS CRIMINALLY.

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:02.647

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:05.249
PERMANENTLY CHANGED DAMAGES

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:07.985
ENGLISH COUPLED WITH THE LOG IN

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:09.320

GOT THE PROVERBIAL DAY IN

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.659

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:15.693
ONE WAY TO BRING ABOUT A FULL

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:16.894

CULTURE WHICH MAY HAVE

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:23.067
CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME. AND

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.368
IN DOING SO WOULD FACILITATE

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:26.170
THE HEALING PROCESS FOR A CHILD

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.538
INSTEAD THE CIVIL JUSTICE

EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY ONE A-

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.838
I BELIEVE THE FOCUS OF SHOULD

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:30.374
BE ONE SIMPLE POINT AND THAT IS

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.877
ABOUT 30% OF MOBILE HOMES IN

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.479
CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED UNDER

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:37.714
LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS THOSE

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:39.082
LOCAL RECKONED WITH TROLL LAWS

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:40.584
HAVE BEEN VALIDATED OVER AND

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:42.352
OVER AGAIN BY THE COURTS ON THE

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:44.521
BASIS THAT WE NEED THAT LAW TO

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.690
PROTECT THE EQUITY INVESTMENT.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.493
THAT THE PARK OWNER HAS IN

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:52.429
THEIR MOBILE HOME. IF PARK

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:54.564
OWNERS PURCHASE THE MOBILE

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:57.200
HOMES IN THEIR PARK THEY PULL

00:48:57.267 --> 00:48:59.803
THOSE UNITS HELP FROM LOCAL

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.972
RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES AND

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.041
THUS REDUCE THE STOCK OF

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.008
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:08.045
COMMUNITY. I HAVE OVER EIGHT

00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.147
THOUSAND MOBILE HOMES IN MY

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:12.282
DISTRICT AND MANY OF THEM ARE

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:15.152
COVERED BY LOCAL RENT CONTROL

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:19.556
LAWS. THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.891
LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN THE

00:49:20.957 --> 00:49:22.826
NINETEEN SEVENTIES IDENTIFIED

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.761
THAT PARK OWNERS NEEDED TO

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.163
APPLY THE SAME RULES TO

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:27.931
THEMSELVES THAT THEY APPLY TO

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:31.068
THEIR PARK RESIDENTS. MY GOAL

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.036
WITH THIS BILL IS JUST SIMPLY

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:35.172
MAKE SURE THAT THAT LAW IS

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:37.274
ENFORCED. BECAUSE THAT'S THE

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.742
BEST WAY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.544
CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.913
CREATING AN OUTPOST CONSENT FOR

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.881
ANY LONGER FOR PARK OWNERS TO

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:47.751
PURCHASE THESE. MOBILE HOMES

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.753
AND TAKE THEM OUT OF THE LOCAL

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.221
RENT CONTROL AND THEREFORE OUT

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.156
OF THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:53.890
HOUSING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:56.593
COMMUNITY. MY GOAL IS NOT TO

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.462
TRY TO FIND A WAY FOR ALL OF

00:49:58.528 --> 00:49:59.596
THE PARK RESIDENTS TO START

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:01.365
RENTING OUT THEIR MOBILE HOMES

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:03.533
AND I THINK. IT'S NOT REALISTIC

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.035
TO THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:07.070
WANT TO DO THAT IF THEY LIVE IN

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.972
A MOBILE HOME AND THEY ARE

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.674
COVERED UNDER RENT CONTROL.

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:11.942
WHAT THEY MOST WANT IS

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.076
STABILITY AND THEY WANT

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:15.345
STABILITY TO KNOW THAT THEY

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:16.913
WILL BE LIVING WITH LIKE MINDED

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.915
NEIGHBORS COVERED BY THE SAME.

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:21.051
RECORD LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAW

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:23.086
AND SO CONSEQUENTLY I THINK

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:25.589
WHAT THIS. DOESN'T DO AS MANY

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:26.757
OF THE SCENARIOS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.125
LAID OUT BY THE OPPONENTS OF

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:29.993
THIS BILL WHICH IS CREATE

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.395
TERRIBLE SITUATIONS WHERE

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.462
THERE'LL BE ALL KINDS OF

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.531
PRINTING ETCETERA. AND I MIGHT

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.032
POINT OUT THAT I THINK THE

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.901
STAFF ANALYSIS THAT WAS

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.202
PRESENTED TO YOU AND THIS HAS

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:41.505
BEEN OUTSTANDING AND THAT STAFF

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.807
ANALYSIS VERY CLEARLY POINTS

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:45.642
OUT A NUMBER ONE THAT THE

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.010
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION WAS

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.712
VERY CLEAR. NOW THAT THE

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:49.679
OPPONENTS ARE PICKING AND

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.882
CHOOSING- AND THEN ALSO

00:50:51.948 --> 00:50:55.018
OFFERING SOME VERY ODD.

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:56.953
ANTIDOTE ALL PIECES OF EVIDENCE

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.021
TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S GOING

00:50:58.088 --> 00:51:00.023
TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.926
TERMS OF LEASING AND SUB

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.995
LEASING AND RENTING OUT OF

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:07.564
THEIR SPACES. IN REALITY THE

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:12.969
FINAL THING. I'D LIKE TO LEAVE

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:13.537
WITH YOU IS SIMPLY THIS. IF

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.038
OWNERS DON'T TO RE. TO OUT

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.807
THEIR MO HOMES. AND I THINK

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:19.242
THAT'S GREAT. AS I LIKE TO KEEP

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:20.877

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:21.745
THERE AND KEEP THE CURRENT

00:51:21.812 --> 00:51:23.313
SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. ALL THEY

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.182
HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:26.917
THAT'S THE RULE AND THEN THEY

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.819
NEED TO FOLLOW IT ALSO. BUT IF

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.687
THEY FOLLOW THAT RULE. AND

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:33.490

TWENTY THIRTEEN. THEN WE

SIXTY ONE. WE ESSENTIALLY

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.418
DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF

HIM. WMA POSES THIS MEASURE

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.035
BECAUSE OWNERS ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.670
CONTRACT WITH THE RESIDENT WHO

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:03.239

WITH THE RESIDENT OWNER EITHER.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.814
THAT'S WHY WE DON'T BELIEVE

SEVEN LEASING AND RENTING OR

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.551
THE SAME CONCEPT. THERE'S ALSO

00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:26.896
PREVENTS ANYONE FROM RUNNING

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:33.002

OR A YEAR. IN DOING IT

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.614
ANNUALLY. WHY ARE THEY GETTING%

00:59:44.681 --> 00:59:47.884
THE BENEFIT OF RENT CONTROL.

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.185
SHOULD SOMEBODY ELSE BE GETTING

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.820
THAT BENEFIT SOMEBODY THAT

00:59:50.887 --> 00:59:53.890
ACTUALLY NEEDS TO NEEDS TO HELP.

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:55.391
THE STATE SHOULD WANT PEOPLE TO

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.007

SIGNIFICANT REHABILITATIVE WORK

WANTED TO JUST SPEAK FOR A

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.086
MOMENT TO THIS BILL BECAUSE I

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:26.055
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.990
THE MEMBERS BEFORE HAND TO AND

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.358

RELATED TO MOBILE HOME PARKS

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.208
AND I THINK THERE IS A

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.410
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE I KNOW

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:49.945
THIS IS BASIC TO EVERYBODY BUT

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.648
BETWEEN THE COSTA HAWKINS

NINETEEN NINETIES AND MOBILE

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:01.657
HOME RENT CONTROL BECAUSE

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:04.794
MOBILE HOME OWNERS ARE HOSTAGES

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.662
THEY DO NOT OWN THE LAND THAT

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.297
IS UNDERNEATH THEIR MOBILE HOME

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:09.598
AND IF THERE IS AN EXCESSIVE

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:12.902
RATE INCREASE. FOR THE SPACE OF

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:14.270
THAT THEIR MOBILE HOMES ON AND

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:16.072
THEY OWN THE MOBILE HOME OR

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:17.273
THEY DON'T HAVE THE BUILDING

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.874
MANY TIMES TO MOVE IT THEY'RE

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.576
AT THE MERCY SO THERE HAS BEEN

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.211
ESTABLISHED MOBILE HOME RENT

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:24.814
CONTROL AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.916
THE LOCALS THAT SERVE A RENT

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:28.984
CONTROL THAT SURVIVE. THAT

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:30.720
GUARANTEES A RATE OF RETURN

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:33.956
THAT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:37.193
PARK OWNER END GUARANTEES A

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:39.061
RATE OF RENT INCREASES FOR THE

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.629
PEOPLE THAT ARE MOBILE HOME

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:42.598
OWNERS IN MANY CASES ARE

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.400
SENIORS AND PEOPLE ON FIXED

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:47.103
INCOMES SO THIS IS AFFORDABLE

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:49.238
HOUSING IN A STATE WHERE THERE

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:50.773

THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.178
ADDRESS AND MAYBE THEY'RE STILL

01:06:56.245 --> 01:07:01.083
AMENDMENTS. THAT NEED TO BE

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.717
DONE ON CERTAIN PARTS OF THIS.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.252

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:12.695
OF NEEDED JUST GIVEN WHAT WE

THE LEGISLATURE WITH THIS BILL.

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:33.182

DENIED THE SAME POSSIBILITY TO

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.113
LATER IT SAYS THIS BILL IS A

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.318

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.988
SAYS THE OPPONENTS

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.457
CORRESPONDENTS MAKES IT CLEAR

01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:49.758
THAT IN SPITE OF THE PLAIN

01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:51.627

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.899
IT THEY DO NOT FULLY ACCEPT THE

CAST. AND I THINK MOST

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:08.344
SIGNIFICANTLY IN MY LAST

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.613

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:12.248
OF THE OPINION THE OPPONENTS

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:13.716
CONTEND THAT THE OPINION

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.484
SOMEHOW SUPPORTS THE OPPOSITE

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.887
CONCLUSION. SO WHEN YOU HAVE

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:19.522
OPPONENTS STAND UP AND SAY THE

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:21.724

ESTABLISH THOSE RULES. ANYWAY

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.171
THAT THEY WANT JUST AS LONG AS

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:37.706
THEY FOLLOW THE SAME RULES SO

01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:39.909
WHEN THEY RAISE THE SHOP IS THE

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.977
THESE ARGUMENTS I HOPE WE COULD

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.946
