01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:37.714 region:rollup2
FOR PAYMENT IS A FRAUDULENT

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:39.416 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PRACTICE.

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:41.551 region:rollup2
THAT MISLEADS CONSUMERS AND

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:44.321 region:rollup2
EXPOSES LGBT PEOPLE.

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:47.323 region:rollup2
TO DAMAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:48.858 region:rollup2
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT LGBT IS

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:50.660 region:rollup2
PART OF THE NATURAL SPECTRUM OF

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:53.697 region:rollup2
HUMAN IDENTITY.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.832 region:rollup2

CONVERSION THERAPY IS A PRACTICE

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.548 region:rollup2
FOR MINORS

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.982 region:rollup2
IT IS STILL BEING PRACTICED ON

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:15.685 region:rollup2
ADULTS EVEN THOUGH CONTEMPORARY

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:17.120 region:rollup2
SCIENCE RECOGNIZES THAT LGBT IS

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:18.788 region:rollup2
PART OF THE NATURAL SPECTRUM OF

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:22.025 region:rollup2
HUMAN IDENTITY? AND IS NOT A

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:23.159 region:rollup2
DISEASE DISORDER OR ILLNESS.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.294 region:rollup2

SUFFERS DAMAGES AS A RESULT OF

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.865 region:rollup2
THESE HARMFUL PRACTICES THEN THE

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:30.867 region:rollup2
CONSUMER COULD BRING AN ACTION

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.068 region:rollup2
TO RECOVER THOSE DAMAGES.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.269 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY AB TWENTY NINE FORTY

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:35.405 region:rollup2

OF SPEECH OR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.807 region:rollup2

FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES KNOW WHAT

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.228 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO PROFIT FROM THEM.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.863 region:rollup2
A CONVERSION THERAPY IS A

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:01.664 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THAT HAS NO

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:04.033 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC BASIS.

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:05.535 region:rollup2
I AM THINKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:07.003 region:rollup2
AND AND ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:09.038 region:rollup2

MISLED BY THINGS THAT THEY HEAR

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:13.610 region:rollup2
THAT THEY THINK I MIGHT BE TRUER

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.245 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE ACCURATE IN THIS YEAR I

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.580 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED A BILL. THAT WOULD

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:19.249 region:rollup2
HELP US SUPPORT LGBT STUDENTS

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:22.819 region:rollup2
BULLYING OR IMPACTED BY THINGS

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:24.053 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT CAUSE HARM TO THEM. I

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:25.155 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RUSTED

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.990 region:rollup2
THE CLEAR THAT THIS IS A

01:05:25.155 --> 01:05:28.458 region:rollup2
FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY AND THAT

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.193 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PENALTIES FOR ANYONE

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:31.895 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD PROFIT OFF OF IT. AND

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:34.764 region:rollup2
I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB

YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:45.074 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT ISSUE I THINK AND I I

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:46.676 region:rollup2
THINK THE REASON WHY.

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:47.410 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFICULT ISSUE IS

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:48.945 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT GOES TO THE VERY.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:49.813 region:rollup2
.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.815 region:rollup2
CENTER OF PEOPLE'S IDENTITY.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:53.016 region:rollup2
.

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.783 region:rollup2
AND AND WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:56.319 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THEY ARE.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:58.388 region:rollup2
.

01:05:56.319 --> 01:06:00.290 region:rollup2
AND SO I AM VERY MUCH HEARD MY

01:05:58.388 --> 01:06:01.691 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY OTHERS.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.959 region:rollup2
IN IN COMMITTEE WHEN THE WHEN

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:05.161 region:rollup2
THE BILL WAS UP.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.095 region:rollup2
AND DEFTLY HEARD.

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:08.164 region:rollup2
FROM HIM THE HURT AND YOU KNOW

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:09.766 region:rollup2
THE.

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:12.302 region:rollup2
THE OSTRACIZE ASIAN THAT MANY

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:14.404 region:rollup2
FEEL. MANY IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.538 region:rollup2
OF FELT. BECAUSE OF.

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.307 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:18.875 region:rollup2
HAPPENED ESPECIALLY AS BEING A

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:20.677 region:rollup2
YOUNG PERSON AND.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:22.645 region:rollup2
AND ON AND STRUGGLING WITH

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:24.514 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF OF IDENTITY.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:26.182 region:rollup2
AND SO I VERY MUCH FEAR THAT I

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:28.084 region:rollup2
SEE IN A.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:30.086 region:rollup2
NO THAT THAT'S THE MOTIVATION.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:33.256 region:rollup2
BEHIND YOUR BILL.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:34.224 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE THING THAT.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:36.392 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:38.361 region:rollup2
CONSIDER YOU AS HE'S MOVING

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:39.929 region:rollup2
FORWARD HIS BILL IS.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:41.364 region:rollup2
IS CONSIDERING THE VERY GENUINE

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:42.765 region:rollup2
I THINK LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCE OF

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:44.200 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WHO TESTIFIED IN THAT

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:45.401 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.003 region:rollup2
AND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:49.239 region:rollup2
THAT HELP THEM.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:50.306 region:rollup2
AND THAT WORK FOR THEM.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.808 region:rollup2
I'M I BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE WERE

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.076 region:rollup2
VERY I MEAN.

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:55.144 region:rollup2
HEARING THAT TESTIMONY WAS VERY

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:56.946 region:rollup2
POWERFUL AS WELL.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.615 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT.

01:06:56.946 --> 01:07:01.317 region:rollup2
FREEDOM IF IT MEAN SOMETHING IT

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:02.252 region:rollup2
MEANS IT MEANS AND.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:04.454 region:rollup2
THE BILL WOULD BE FREE TO BE WHO

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:05.655 region:rollup2
YOU ARE.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:07.257 region:rollup2
TOM AND I THINK IT ALSO MUST

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.857 region:rollup2
ALSO MEAN.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:09.726 region:rollup2
FREEDOM TO BE WHO YOU WANT TO

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.426 region:rollup2
BE.

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:12.495 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FOR THOSE

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:13.796 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW WHO HAVE

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.831 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED AND HAVE HAVE COME

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:15.398 region:rollup2
FORWARD DOOR AS THIS BILL IS

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:17.300 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

01:07:15.398 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.337 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.804 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS WHO THEY ARE.

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:23.539 region:rollup2
AND.

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.107 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.075 region:rollup2
THAT EXPERIENCE IT MIGHT BE

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:26.910 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.811 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCE

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.979 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:31.247 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S BEEN VERY HURTFUL

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:32.815 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:34.083 region:rollup2
DAMAGING BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE I

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:35.552 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.719 region:rollup2
LIVING IN A FREE SOCIETY IS IS

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.854 region:rollup2
THE FREEDOM?

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.823 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT DO THINGS THAT

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:42.559 region:rollup2
MAYBE WE THINK ARE NOT THE BEST.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.826 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT WE THINK ARE HER

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.461 region:rollup2
FULLER DAMAGES I THINK THAT'S

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.029 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.396 region:rollup2
THE LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCE OF

01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:49.132 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:50.400 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE?

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.402 region:rollup2
GONE THROUGH CONVERSION THERAPY

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.403 region:rollup2
AND HAVE SET HAVES AND HAVES.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.938 region:rollup2
AT HAVE SAID THAT THIS WAS A

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.438 region:rollup2
GOOD THING FOR THEM THE OTHER

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:57.206 region:rollup2
THING I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:59.242 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IS.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.209 region:rollup2
IS POTENTIALLY APPLICATION FOR

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:03.346 region:rollup2
FOR THE FAITH COMMUNITY.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:04.280 region:rollup2
.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:07.116 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MAYBE THIS BEARS A

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.818 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF EXPLANATION IS.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:09.719 region:rollup2
CHRISTIANS DO BELIEVE AND.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:13.890 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE IN SPIRITUAL

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:14.490 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.258 region:rollup2
CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.993 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:19.028 region:rollup2
SINNERS

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:24.033 region:rollup2
WE WE ALL EQUALLY FALLS SHORT OF

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:25.034 region:rollup2
THE GLORY OF GOD.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.170 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT CHRIST DID

01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:28.771 region:rollup2
ON THE CROSS.

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:30.640 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A NEW HEART AND

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:33.710 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A SPIRIT.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.011 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSFORMS US.

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:36.813 region:rollup2
AND SO CHRISTIANS BELIEVE THAT

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:38.081 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:39.649 region:rollup2
AND THEY PRACTICE THAT IN THEIR

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:41.384 region:rollup2
FAITH.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.518 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYBODY PRACTICES THAT

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:44.253 region:rollup2
FAITH NOBODY SAYING THAT.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:45.788 region:rollup2
ANYBODY.

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:47.724 region:rollup2
IS GONNA BE FORCED TO PRACTICE.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:49.325 region:rollup2
THAT FAITH.

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:50.593 region:rollup2
BUT THEY LEGITIMATELY PACKS

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:52.862 region:rollup2
THAT FAITH IN THERE ARE BOOKS

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:56.199 region:rollup2
CONFERENCES THERE ARE. AREAS

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:58.801 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE COULD BE.

01:08:56.199 --> 01:09:03.039 region:rollup2
A TRANSACTION INVOLVES.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:06.476 region:rollup2

LET ME JUST SAY THIS YOU KNOW

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:11.714 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SAN I BELIEVE

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:14.350 region:rollup2
HOMOPHOBIA IS A SIN.

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:15.318 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE OSTRACIZING A GROUP

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.386 region:rollup2
AND MALIGNING A GROUP AND

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:20.356 region:rollup2
SLANDERING A GROUP.

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:22.725 region:rollup2
IS A SIN.

01:09:20.356 --> 01:09:25.128 region:rollup2
AND SO LOOK AS AS CHRISTIANS

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:26.262 region:rollup2
PRACTICING WE ARE TRYING TO.

01:09:25.128 --> 01:09:28.431 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE AGAINST

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:29.499 region:rollup2

01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:32.001 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR THAT IS OUR

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:34.237 region:rollup2

THAT GOD CAN CHANGE US.

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:36.873 region:rollup2
GOD I HOPE WE CAN CHAINS HAVE

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:37.974 region:rollup2

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:15.871 region:rollup2
MANDATED REPORTERS THEY WERE

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:22.378 region:rollup2
THEY DID NOTHING.

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:24.046 region:rollup2
AND DINNER MICHIGAN LAW WHICH

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:25.414 region:rollup2
HAS A TERRIBLE FLAW.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:27.349 region:rollup2
THEY OF THE VICTIMS HAD NO

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:28.784 region:rollup2

THEY LIVE IN OUR STATE. AND THEY

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:35.324 region:rollup2

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:36.992 region:rollup2
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:38.594 region:rollup2

NOT A RECURRING PENALTY? AND THE

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:21.170 region:rollup2
ABUSE CAN CONTINUE WELL BEYOND

01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
THAT ONE YEAR AND THOSE KIDS ARE

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:24.706 region:rollup2
