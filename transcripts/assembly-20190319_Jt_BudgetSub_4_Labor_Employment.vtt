00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.544
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CARE YOU

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:27.412

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:28.479

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:44.802
COUPLE.

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:46.737
SORT OF MAJOR POINTS THAT WE

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.773
INCLUDED IN IN A HAND OUT THAT

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.308
WE'VE RECENTLY RELEASED THAT

00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:52.109
CONSIDERS OPTIONS --

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:52.944
THAT THE STATE WE THINK SHOULD

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.145
CONSIDER --

00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:57.181
IN EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:36:57.248 --> 00:36:57.715
THAT YOU HAVE THAT HANDOUT

00:36:57.782 --> 00:37:00.251
AVAILABLE --

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:01.419
ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANTED TO

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:03.254
LOOK OUT IN A IN THIS HANDOUT

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.822
WAS TO COMPARE.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.190
CALIFORNIA'S PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:07.825
PROGRAM TO LEAVE PROGRAMS IN

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.760
OTHER STATES AND TO LEAVE

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.629
PROGRAMS OTHER COUNTRIES --

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:12.797
SO BEGINNING FROM THE

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:14.599
INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE --

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:16.500
AS YOU KNOW THE U. S. IS THE

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.935
ONLY HIGH INCOME COUNTRY IN THE

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:18.936
WORLD THAT DOES NOT HAVE A

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:20.204
NATIONAL PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:22.340
POLICY -- SO

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:24.175
OBVIOUSLY WITH THAT IN MIND WE

00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:25.543
THINK OF COMPARING CALIFORNIA'S

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:27.511
POLICIES TO THOSE IN OTHER

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:28.846
COUNTRIES --

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:31.215
THE TWO BIG DISTINCTIONS THAT WE

00:37:31.282 --> 00:37:33.284
WOULD DRAW IN THE INTERNATIONAL

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.553
PERSPECTIVE --

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:37.088
OUR FIRST THAT.

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:38.723
BY AND LARGE OTHER COUNTRIES

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.391
TEND TO OFFER LONGER LEAF

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.026
DURATIONS AND CALIFORNIA DOES

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:44.095
AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.329
MATERNITY LEAVE.

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.797
BECAUSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IT'S

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.432
MORE OFTEN THE CASE THAT

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:50.234
MATERNITY LEAVES OUR OFFER FOR A

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:51.802
LONG DURATION FOR A LONGER

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:53.804
DURATION I SHOULD SAY RELATIVE

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:55.306
TO PATERNITY LEAVE FOR IN

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:56.641
CALIFORNIA THERE PEOPLE DURATION

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:57.208
SO.

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:59.610
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THAN

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:00.444
OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:01.545
THE SECOND DISTINCTION THAT I

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.214
WOULD POINT OUT --

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.482
RELATIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES IS

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:06.017
THAT.

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:06.684
OTHER COUNTRIES TEND TO

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.052
STRUCTURE THEIR PROGRAMMES

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.187
DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO --

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.355
THIS MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:15.092
NUMBER OF WAYS ONE EXAMPLE JUST --

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:17.461
FOR ILLUSTRATION IS CANADA IN

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:20.331
CANADA NEW PARENTS SO THINKING

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:23.200
OF BONDING CLAIMS SPECIFICALLY.

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:25.403
NEW PARENTS CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.438
OPTIONS THEY CAN CHOOSE TO TAKE

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:30.141
A SHORTER DURATION LEAVE BUT

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:30.608
RECEIVE A HIGHER WAGE

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:31.676
REPLACEMENT.

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:32.510
OR THEY CAN CHOOSE A LONGER

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.378
LEAVE PERIOD AS A LOWER WAGE

REPLACEMENTS OF BASED ON THE

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:53.564
FAMILIES ON CIRCUMSTANCES --

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:54.165
TURNING TO OUR COMPARISON TO

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:55.399
OTHER STATES ON PAGE EIGHT OF

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:55.900
OUR HAND OUT.

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:56.567
WE INCLUDE A FIGURE THAT SORT OF

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.234
POSITIONS CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.402
OTHER STATES.

00:38:58.469 --> 00:38:59.937
AND AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WAS

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:00.571
THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY

00:39:00.638 --> 00:39:01.672
TO IMPLEMENT PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:02.707
SENSE THAN. FIVE ADDITIONAL

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:05.776
STATES MOST STATES HAVE

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:08.746
SIMILARLY STRUCTURED PLANS STATE

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:09.280
THEY LARGELY RESEMBLE ONE

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:11.082
ANOTHER --

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.016
DESPITE THAT.

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:13.384
A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:14.618
POINT OUT --

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.353
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.388
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:18.889
THE STATE'S WAIT REPLACEMENT

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.492
RATE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS 60%

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:22.993
FOR MOST WORKERS IS TOWARD THE

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.696
LOWER END AMONG OTHER STATES.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.198
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE WEEKLY

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:29.333
MAXIMUM.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.202
BENEFITS OF THE CAP WHICH IS THE

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:32.369
WEEKLY MAXIMUM --

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:34.004
A BENEFICIARY CAN RECEIVE WHILE

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:35.306
ON LEAVE IS MUCH HIGHER IN

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.874
CALIFORNIA THAN IT IS IN ANY

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.009
OTHER STATE.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:39.777
SO.

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:43.114
WITH THESE COMPARISONS IN MIND.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.115
THE DECISION THAT THE

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.916
LEGISLATURE FACES OVER THE NEXT

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:48.085
COUPLE OF MONTHS REALLY IS FIRST

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.720
AND FOREMOST WHETHER TO EXPAND

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:51.122
PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:52.690
AND SECONDLY IF.

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:55.626
SO HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THAT.

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.361
AND SO IN THINKING ABOUT THE

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.130
LATTER HOW ONE WOULD GO ABOUT

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.298
EXPANDING LEAVE WE REALLY

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:03.134
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE. TO

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.468
THINK ABOUT WHAT IT HOPES TO

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.904
ACCOMPLISH BY EXPANDING LEAVE.

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.806
AND THEN TO CONSIDER AND PUT

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.708
INTO PRACTICE THE BEST POLICY

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:13.077
OPTIONS RIGHT TO SAY THE MOST

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:14.478
EFFECTIVE POLICY OPTIONS THAT

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:17.047
COULD ADDRESS WHAT YOU HOPE TO

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.282
ACCOMPLISH --

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:19.583
FOR INSTANCE ARE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.252
PROPOSAL IT'S BEEN PRETTY CLEAR

00:40:21.318 --> 00:40:22.987
AND IDENTIFYING EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:25.356
DEVELOPMENT AS THE PRIMARY USE

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.792
OF MOTIVATING FACTOR.

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:29.226
AND FOR THAT IN ORDER.

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.828
TO ADDRESS THAT GOAL THE

00:40:30.895 --> 00:40:33.297
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CONCEPTUALLY

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:34.899
TO EXPAND THE DURATION OF LEAVE.

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.500
AND ALSO TO MAKE LEAVE MORE

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:37.568
FLEXIBLE.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:39.236
NOW ON THE OTHER HAND THE

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.205
LEGISLATURE PRIMARY MOTIVATION

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.773
OR GOAL MAY BE DIFFERENT --

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.408
FOR INSTANCE IF LEGISLATORS

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.243
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.145
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO USE PAID

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:49.046
FAMILY LEAVE SO.

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.081
THE TAKE UP RATE FOR THE STATE'S

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:52.349
CURRENT PROGRAM.

00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:53.384
EXPANDING THE DURATION OF LEAVE

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.219
MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.987
POLICY WE THANK.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.089
ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:59.156 --> 00:40:59.857
COULD.

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.659
SERVE CONSIDER OPTIONS TO

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.194
INCREASE OUTREACH SO THAT

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.362
AWARENESS IS IMPROVE THE PROGRAM

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:07.131
OR POTENTIALLY CHANGES TO THE

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.632
WEIGHT REPLACEMENT RATES THINGS

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.334
THAT ARE MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.802
WE THINK COULD DRIVE --

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:16.841
HIGHER TAKE UP RATE THAN THAN WE

00:41:16.907 --> 00:41:20.945
AND AND WE ALSO WANTED TO LOOK.

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:24.048
AT OPTIONS FOR FUNDING PAYING

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:25.549
FOR AN EXPANDED --

00:41:25.616 --> 00:41:26.584
POLICY.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.952
AND AT THIS PRELIMINARY STAGE

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.453
MINDFUL THAT WE'RE STILL VERY

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.055
EARLY ON IN THE GOVERNOR'S IS

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.090
PROPOSING TO FORM A TASK FORCE

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:34.425
TO CONSIDER THESE OPTIONS.

00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:35.960
OUR OFFICE DIDN'T SCORE A

00:41:36.026 --> 00:41:37.761
SPECIFIC.

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.864
OPTION OR A SCENARIO --

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.365
WITHIN SCORE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:43.000
CONCEPTUAL PLAN FOR ISN'T FOR

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:44.969
INSTANCE WE TOOK A BIT.

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.871
OF A BROADER LANDS APPROACH AND

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:48.239
WE ASKED OURSELVES. FOR THINKING

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:50.908
ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.276
STRUCTURE SO YOU HAVE THIS.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.744
THE PAYROLL TAX RATE THAT CAN

00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:55.512
MOVE UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS BASED

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:56.313
ON THE AMOUNT OF BENEFITS THAT

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.283
ARE GOING OUT IT'S CAPPED AT ONE

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:00.451
POINT 5% WE SET OURSELVES.

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.786
HOW MUCH COULD BENEFITS INCREASE?

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.121
WITHIN CURRENT LAW WITHOUT

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.789
MAKING CHANGES TO LAW AND ALSO

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.591
STAYING UNDER THE ONE POINT 5%

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:08.792
CAP.

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.828
AND WE THINK.

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:11.795
THAT.

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:14.265
PAYROLL TAXES COULD INCREASE

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:16.233
WITHIN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. TO

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.502
SUPPORT AT LEAST ONE BILLION

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:19.904
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:21.538
NOT LIKELY MORE THAN TWO BILLION

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:23.874
NOW -- EACH

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:26.277
YEAR AND AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.411
BENEFITS.

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:28.545
AND WE THINK THIS IS SORT OF A

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:31.315
USEFUL BENCHMARK THIS ONE TO TWO

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.716
BILLION MARK --

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:34.518
KNOWING THAT CURRENT PAID FAMILY

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:36.320
LEAVE BENEFITS EACH YEAR ARE

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.821
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IT JUST

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.089
PROVIDES OUT ROUGH ORDER OF

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.959
MAGNITUDE AS TO WHAT THE SERVER.

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:45.562
POTENTIAL OF THE EXISTING FINING

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:46.830
WE NEED TO MAKE ANY MAJOR

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:47.865
CHANGES --

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:49.400
THAT SAID.

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.801
AND EXPANSION THAT GOES BEYOND

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:51.802
THAT AMOUNT.

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.270
WOULD OBVIOUSLY REQUIRE THE

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.872
LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFIED

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:56.840
ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE OR

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:59.076
CHANGE STATE LAW TO A SERV.

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:01.412
MAKE CHANGES TO THE THE EXISTING --

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:02.713
ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE TO

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.549
ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS --

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.485
WITH THAT I'LL TURN NOW TO MY

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:09.053
COLLEAGUE SET TO FINISH OUR

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.989
PRESENTATION.

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:12.389
SEC KIRSTINE LA --

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:13.791
THE LAST FEW PAGES OF OUR

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.726
HANDOUT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.928
POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF EXPANDING

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.230
PAID FAMILY LEAVE FOCUSING.

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:22.933
PRIMARILY ON THE EFFECTS OF

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.269
LENGTHENING LEAVE BENEFITS --

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:26.670
WE DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:28.205
LENGTHENING WE'VE BENEFITS IS

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.607
NECESSARILY PREFERABLE TO OTHER

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.776
OPTIONS SUCH AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.611
REFERRED TO LIKE RIP.

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.981
INCREASING THE REPLACEMENT RATE --

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.682
THAT SERVE WHICH OPTION IS WORTH

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.084
PURSUING SIR DEPENDS ON THE

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.819
LEGISLATURE'S GOALS AND HOW

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.288
THOSE LINK UP TO THE DIFFERENT

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:44.922
POLICY OPTIONS THAT ARE BEFORE

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:46.323
YOU -- THE

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.725
MAIN REASON WE FOCUS ON ONE

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.727
THING BENEFITS IS SIMPLY THAT

00:43:49.793 --> 00:43:51.128
THAT'S THE OPTION THAT'S BEEN

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.696
STUDIED THE MOST EXTENSIVELY IN

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:55.632
THE LITERATURE --

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.935
I'LL HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE SETS OF

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:00.471
FOR FACT OF LEAVE BENEFITS ON

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:02.039
PARENTS EMPLOYMENT WE

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:04.074
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHORT TERM

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.477
EFFECTS AND LONG TERM EFFECTS.

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.145
SO THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS WELL

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:10.214
PARENTS ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TO

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.783
ARE UNCERTAIN WITH SOME EVIDENCE

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.852
POINTING TOWARD SUBSTANTIAL

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:16.520
INCREASES IN PARENTS EMPLOYMENT.

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.455
AND OTHER EVIDENCE POINTING

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:20.157
TOWARDS MINIMAL AFFECTS. ONE OR

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:22.159
TERM THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.761
THE EFFECTS OF ON PARENTS

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:25.462
EMPLOYMENT BEYOND.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:26.597
THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF THEIR

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:29.466
KIDS LIVES WOULD LIKELY BE

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:30.567
PRETTY SMALL.

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:32.503
TURNING TO THE EFFECT ON KIDS WE

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:34.471
FIND IT SIMILARLY USEFUL TO

00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:37.241
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHORT TERM

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.675
AND LONG TERM AFFECTS.

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.811
ALL LONGER LEAVE BENEFITS LIKE

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:44.281
WE WOULD IMPROVE INFANTS HEALTH.

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.916
AT THE SAME TIME THE LONGER TERM

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:47.918
EFFECTS ON THE KIDS HEALTH

00:44:47.985 --> 00:44:49.453
EDUCATION AND LABOR MARKET

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.988
OUTCOMES ARE.

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.790
UNCERTAIN WITH SOME EVIDENCE

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:55.192
POINTING TO SUBSTANTIAL EFFECTS

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.061
AND SOME EVIDENCE POINTING TO

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.529
MINIMAL EFFECTS SO THAT

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.030
CONCLUDES OUR TESTIMONY AND WE'D

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.566
BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:03.767
YOU HAVE ANY.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.835
THANK YOU ALL OF ANY QUESTIONS

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.688
JUST CONCERN AROUND --

00:45:24.755 --> 00:45:26.056
THIS THE FACT THAT I THINK ARE

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:28.158
LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE NOT --

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.393

MISCLASSIFIED AND WE HAVE

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.972
CHALLENGES AROUND SAME KIND OF

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:44.274
PROTECTIONS --

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.276
THAT OTHER WORKERS HAVE AND THAT

00:45:46.343 --> 00:45:47.144
FOR PAID LEAVE THEIR UNDER A

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.812
SEPARATE PROGRAM IS THAT RIGHT

IS THAT THE DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.249
SELECTIVE COVERAGE.

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.718
YEAH DEC MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:57.087

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.122
YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT CONTRACT

00:45:58.188 --> 00:45:58.388
WORKERS --

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.323
COULD GET COUNTY WORKERS DON'T

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:01.158
EVEN KNOW THAT IT EXISTS --

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:03.360
I SAW A STUDY THAT SAID IN

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:05.162
TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THE TURN

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:05.863
FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:07.531
CLASSIFIEDS IS ONLY THIRTY TWO

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.900
DECIDED.

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.635
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.637
THIRTY TWO WORKERS --

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:16.206
SO.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.442
THANK YOU COLLEAGUES.

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.611
YES AGREEING ON THAT --

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:21.378
YOU KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.447
IT THERE'S IT'S IT'S CUMBERSOME

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:25.282
THERE'S MANY STEPS --

00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:26.183
AND AGAIN MANY THESE WORKERS I

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.518
THINK OUR MISCLASSIFIED AND NOW

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.218
WE HAVE OTHER PENDING

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:29.820
LEGISLATION TO HELP RECTIFY THAT

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:31.021
ISSUE -- BUT

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.055
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.423
ALL ARE ADDRESSING IT THINKING

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:34.758
ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.559
TYPES OF PROTECTIONS BECAUSE

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.793
THESE ARE TEND TO BE LOWER WAGE

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.961
WORKERS --

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:39.663
TEND TO BE WOMEN OF COLOR TEND

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.931
TO BE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW WE

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.032
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.635
GETTING THE BENEFITS THAT THEY

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:44.902
DESERVE.

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:45.502
BUT THE SOMEONE WHICH I WOULD

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:46.670
SAY THAT --

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:49.373
WE HAVE DONE SOME WORK BUT IT'S

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:50.374
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.275
FRANKLY --

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.509
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THE

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:53.810
PROGRAM STARTED --

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:54.511
THE LIGHTS IN THE STATE WERE

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:57.047
STARTING TO FLICKER ON THE

00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:58.582
ECONOMICS WERE DOWN --

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.184
IN THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME AND

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.618
THEN SUBSEQUENT GOVERNOR.

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:03.353
DIDN'T PUT.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.155
ANY MONEY TOWARDS OUTRAGE.

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.623
SO WE STARTED A PROGRAM WITH

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.425
VERY LITTLE FUNDS --

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:11.328
IT'S PRIMARILY A MANUAL PROCESS

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.229
EVEN TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:13.697
THAT THAT LENDS ITSELF TO SOME

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:14.698
OTHER PROBLEMS.

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:15.566
BUT WITHOUT BUT DELAYED

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.100
IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL SORTS OF

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.702
DIFFERENT GREAT IDEAS --

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:20.737
BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS A COUPLE

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:22.673
YEARS BACK WE RECEIVED ABOUT SIX

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:23.941
MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH SOME

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:24.942
WORK OF SOME OF THE ADVOCATES --

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.777
HERE LATER ON TODAY TO START TO

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.412
DO SOME OF THAT WORK A SOMEBODY

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.080
WHO I KNOW WHO HAS DONE MEDIA

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.682
BUYS AND KNOWS THAT WORLD. SIX

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:32.950
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.585
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET YOU VERY

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.153
FAR -- SO

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.155
WE'VE DONE SOME WORK --

00:47:38.222 --> 00:47:39.323
WE'VE DONE A LOT OUT REACH TO

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:41.158
OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS I THINK

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.626
THAT'S WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.261
CALL THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.395
WORK THAT WE DID --

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.564
WE STARTED TO DO SOME VERY

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:51.101
TARGETED THAT'S OF THINGS --

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.803
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS --

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.671
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF WORK TO

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.906
BE DONE QUICKLY TO THOSE LOW

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.507
WAGE WORKERS WE HAVE DONE SOME

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.376
WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES.

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.144
NOT ONLY IN THE TARGETED AREAS

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:03.313
OF LOS ANGELES THE HAS A LOW

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.548
UPTAKE RATE I THINK THAT

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:05.849
REFLECTS WHAT YOU SAW THE LA

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.417
OWES REPORT --

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.253
AS WELL AS A MINORITY --

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.854
LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.489
POPULATIONS --

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:14.057
BUT THEN ALSO --

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.692
FRANKLY FATHERS --

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:16.793
IN TRYING TO GET THE UP TOOK A

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.061
FATHER'S BEEN MORE INVOLVED IN

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.096
THE FAMILY.

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.163
AWAY FROM WHAT --

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.567
THIS IN ANTIQUATED VIEW OF THE

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:27.204
FATHER'S ROLE IN THE FILM.

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.038
LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS AND

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.273
OTHERS ON THIS PANEL AS A FATHER

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:30.874
OF A THREE YEAR OLD --

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.075
THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IT'S VERY

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:33.777
CLOSE TO HOME I DO HAVE ONE

00:48:33.844 --> 00:48:34.311
FOLLOW UP QUESTION AROUND

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:35.112
OUTREACH --

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.413
YOU MENTIONED THE CHALLENGES

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.714
WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:39.116
LATINO COMMUNITIES I'LL TELL YOU

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.651
THIS CONCEPT OF PAID FAMILY

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.918
LEAVE IS REALLY NOT A DISCUSSION

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.287
OF THE API COMMUNITY.

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:47.991
EXCEPT FOR WITHIN WELL EDUCATED

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.092
NOT SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF MORE

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:51.161
RECENT API IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:52.963
ARE TALKING ABOUT --

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.897
WHAT SORT OF EFFORTS HAVE BEEN

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.266
MADE IN THE API COMMUNITY I CAN

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.601
A MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHOW YOU

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.503
EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE'VE

00:48:59.569 --> 00:49:01.471
DONE I DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL THOSE

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:02.973
TO TWO PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES IN

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.307
AS MUCH AS?

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:04.708
THOSE WERE LARGER TARGETS

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.877
BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.278
DEMOGRAPHICS --

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.113
AND STUDIES THAT WE DID LEADING

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.317
UP TO DOING THE OUTRAGE AND

00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:15.252
SPENDING THE ABOUT FIVE MILLION

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:16.787
DOLLARS TO DO --

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.921
BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY SOMEONE

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:19.556
TO TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DON'T FOR

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.124
THE API COMMUNITY LOVE TO LEARN

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.492
AT THIS POINT OUR POPULATION IS

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.261
12% AND GROWING SO --

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:26.029
IT AND AND I THINK RELATED TO

00:49:26.096 --> 00:49:28.031
THAT WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:29.333
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:30.701
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:32.469
APPROPRIATE LEVEL ABOUT REACH.

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:34.371
TO BE SPENDING THIS YEAR HAS

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.907
HAPPENED CITED YET.

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.175
THERE ARE NO AMEND I WOULD LOVE

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:39.176
FOR DEAL LEFT TO TALK ABOUT IT

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.143
BUT WHAT I WOLD TELL YOU --

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.912
IS THAT THERE ARE NO --

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.880
FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR OUR EACH

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:44.214
OTHER THAN --

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.482
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE

00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:47.317
PROGRAM AND I WOULD SUGGEST AND

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.052
HOPE THAT THAT IS A PORTION OF

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:51.722
THE BUDGET AS WE MOVE FORWARD --

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:53.890
I WANT TO SHIFT FROM A TO THE LA --

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:57.427
DISK WE FOUND YOUR ANALYSIS OF

00:49:57.494 --> 00:49:58.295
WHAT'S HAPPENING OTHER COUNTRIES

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.930
TO BE INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE I

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.565
THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT --

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.467
AMERICA'S WAY BEHIND WHAT OTHER

00:50:03.533 --> 00:50:04.701
COUNTRIES ARE DOING IN THIS AREA

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.470
AND YOU SAY TO THE FACT THAT

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.104
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDIES IN

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.271
THIS AREA.

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:11.375
HAVE A ANY STUDIES WERE COULD

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.243
YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT HAS

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.478
BEEN CONCLUDED AROUND THE

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:16.780
INVESTMENT AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.115
AND HOW THAT IMPACTS.

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:20.550
LONGER TERM EXPENDITURES WHEN IT

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:22.986
COMES TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.588
OUR EMPLOYMENT SYSTEM OR SOCIAL

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.756
SERVICE SYSTEM.

00:50:25.822 --> 00:50:26.656
I THINK WE ALL AND TO REALLY

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:28.225
BELIEVE THAT THE DOLLARS THAT WE

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.193
INVEST TODAY AT THE EARLY AGE

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:47.310
WITH PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:49.513
CHILD

00:50:49.579 --> 00:50:50.914
CARE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:51.248
EDUCATION --

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:52.215
HAS ENORMOUS DIVIDENDS LONGER

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.016
TERM BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.718
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND GIVEN

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.820
HOW MUCH WOOD SPERRY THERE IS I

00:50:56.887 --> 00:50:58.588
WAS ONE IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT.

00:50:58.655 --> 00:50:59.589
SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION --

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.090
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO --

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:00.690
IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:03.160
LONG TERM FISCAL IMPASSE LONG

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:04.928
TERM OUTCOMES ON THE KIDS AT

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:07.097
LEAST SORT OF THAT --

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.498
SORT OF IN THE IN THE MAIN WAY

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:09.499
THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:11.101
THERE MAY BE OTHER CHANNELS TO

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:12.235
BUT I THINK THAT SORT OF ONE

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:13.770
THAT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THINK

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:15.205
ABOUT FIRST.

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:17.808
FIRST AND I THINK SORT OF WHAT

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.109
WE IT BRIEFLY MENTION IN THE

00:51:19.176 --> 00:51:21.278
HANDOUT IS SORT OF THE MAGNITUDE

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:23.079
ANSWER BASED ON THE RESEARCH AS

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:25.282
AS WE'VE VIEW IT --

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:26.516
THE LAW OF THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.884
THOSE EFFECTS ARE PRETTY

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:29.786
UNCERTAIN SO CERTAINLY TO THE

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:32.155
EXTENT THAT --

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:35.192
THAT THERE COULD BE A LARGE --

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:37.093
LONG TERM BENEFITS THEN

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:37.761
POTENTIALLY THERE COULD BE SOME

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.429
KIND OF A SAVINGS OR OTHER

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.264
BENEFITS REALIZE BUT BUT TO US

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:42.332
THE EVIDENCE IS AND ALL THAT

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:44.501
CLEAR THAT THAT DOES AFFECT OUR

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:48.638
LARGE OR OR WHETHER THEY COULD

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:49.005
POTENTIALLY BE.

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.740
MINIMAL.

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.576
THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME OF HIS

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.443
OFFICE.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.111
SO I I WANT --

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.880
TO OBVIOUSLY LOW INCOME WOMEN

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.048
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS DON'T

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.216
HAVE REALIZE THIS BENEFIT THE

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.817
SAME NUMBERS AS OUR COHORTS

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:02.552
ANOTHER.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.321
CLASSES I GUESS --

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:05.589
HAS THERE BEEN ANY --

00:52:05.655 --> 00:52:06.790
I I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:08.992
CONJECTURE ON OUT REACH AS WELL

00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.460
AS INCOME REPLACEMENT --

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.629
AS WELL ASSINGLE PARENTS VERSUS

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.397
A TWO TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD WHICH

00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.432
MIGHT HAVE LEAD TO THE

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.567
FLEXIBILITY OF BEING ABLE --

00:52:17.634 --> 00:52:20.103
TO TAKE TIME OFF WITH A SMALLER

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.838
BUT HAS THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.573
TO ACTUALLY ASK THESE WOMEN WHO

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.375
ARE NOT EDITED OR MAN BUT I'M

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.176
I'M.

00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:27.344
PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH SINGLE

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.211
MOMS -- IN

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.547
LOW WAGE JOBS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

00:52:30.614 --> 00:52:31.915
ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS FOR THE

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.116
REASONING WHY.

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:35.385
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY.

00:52:35.452 --> 00:52:36.987
I DON'T KNOW ANY PARTICULAR

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:37.821
ROUTE THE TOP OF THE HEAD I

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.956
THINK I'LL DO THE CAPTION LATES

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:40.123
IT.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.058
KIND OF WELL IS THAT THERE IS A

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.160
WIDE BREADTH OF STUDY.

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:45.362
ON THE SUBJECT I I CAN'T PREDICT

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.197
POINT TO A PARTICULAR ONE I

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:49.533
THINK THAT THE POINT THAT YOU'RE

00:52:49.599 --> 00:52:50.800
KIND OF GETTING AT IS.

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:52.402
THIS IS A TAX ON WORKERS AND SO

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.571
YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT 1%

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:56.506
AS AN AWFUL LOT PARTICULAR AT

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.241
THE LOWER WAGE SCALE RIGHT --

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.343
PLACES LIKE THE CITY AND COUNTY

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.145
OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE --

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:04.447
SUPPLEMENTED THE REST OF THE WAY

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:06.249
TO FROM EMPLOYER TAXES THAT CAN

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:06.750
KHALEEL ALSO MENTION.

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:07.918
OTHER COUNTRIES AND SOME OF THE

00:53:07.984 --> 00:53:09.819
OTHER STATES.

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:11.054
AND WHILE CALIFORNIA --

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:14.724
MAY SEEM LIKE IT'S BEHIND IN

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:16.426
SOME AREAS --

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:18.295
THEY OFTENTIMES WHAT YOU'LL SEE

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:18.862
IS A BLENDED.

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:20.597
TAX STRUCTURE WHEN IT COMES THIS

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.966
IN RIGHT NOW --

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.035
SYSTEM IT IS SOLELY FUNDED BY

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:25.869
WORKERS.

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:28.471
AT SOLELY FUNDED BY THE FIRST

00:53:28.538 --> 00:53:29.005
HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:30.507
DOLLARS A WORKER MAKES CREDIT SO

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:31.408
WHILE -- THE

00:53:31.474 --> 00:53:32.809
THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.277
INCOME THAT IS PAID IF YOU'RE

00:53:34.344 --> 00:53:36.680
MAKING SAY --

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:37.314
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:38.882
BECOMES FAR LESS THAN THE PERSON

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.116
THE PERCENTAGE OF THE INCOME

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:42.485
THAT THEY'RE MAKING AN EVEN A

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.086
HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THEM

00:53:43.153 --> 00:53:45.255
HALF HALF THE AMOUNT OF THEIR

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:45.989
INCOME.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:46.790
THE CLEAR DEFINITION OF A

00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:49.192
REGRESSIVE.

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.860
TAX CHANGE.

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:51.928
AT THAT LEVEL THAT HAD THE

00:53:51.995 --> 00:53:53.530
BENEFIT IS CAPPED AT ABOUT

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.197
TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YOU DO

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:56.066
HAVE A CAP OF THE BENEFIT THAT

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.400
YOU CAN RECEIVE FROM.

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:58.635
AT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS --

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:03.273
WHICH YES WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.874
SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND MORE IN A

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.743
YEAR -- MY

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.012
CONCERN AND I'VE BEEN VERY

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.447
HONEST I RESERVE A BILL ON IT IS

00:54:10.513 --> 00:54:11.715
IS THAT --

00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:13.016
LOW INCOME FOLKS BEEN PAIN

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:14.284
THAT'S NOT UTILIZING AND

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:15.685
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED --

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:18.254
AS WE RECOGNIZE AS A BODY THAT

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.489
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:20.624
THE MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.726
CAN'T LIVE ON ON WHAT IS IN A

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.027
MINIMUM WAGE --

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:26.029
AND YET NOT REALIZING THAT THAT

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.831
THEM WOMEN TAKING PARTICULARLY

00:54:27.897 --> 00:54:30.033
SINGLE WOMEN TAKING TIME OFF TO

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.502
IT TO A CHILD AT 770% OF MINIMUM

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:33.203
WAGE.

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:35.071
IS PROBABLY NO MORE DURABLE THAN

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.006
NOT RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE IN

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:38.274
FIRST PLACE --

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:41.177
SO I I JUST A ALTHOUGH OUT REACH

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.846
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT

00:54:42.912 --> 00:54:43.747
SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAS TO BE

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.348
AND ALSO IN THE HANDS OF HUMAN

00:54:45.415 --> 00:54:47.183
RESOURCES AT INDIVIDUAL

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.153
COMPANIES NEED TO PROVIDE SOME --

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.022
GOOD GUIDANCE TO WORKERS BUT

00:54:52.088 --> 00:54:53.723
THAT PERCENTAGE I THINK I'M I'M

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:56.326
JUST CONCERNED OF OF WHAT'S

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:58.161
REALISTIC AND I KNOW THAT OTHER

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.562
STATES HAVE GONE FURTHER --

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.598
GETTING I THINK AS FAR AS 90% OF

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:03.967
INCOME.

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.602
I WILL TELL YOU --

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:06.636
INTO SOME OTHER STATES REACH

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:08.338
VERY HIGH AND I THINK NEW YORK

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.305
IS LOOKING AT MY MEMORY SERVES

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:12.575
ME CLOSE TO A 100% --

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.044
BUT AGAIN IT'S A BLENDED TAX

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:14.944
STRUCTURE --

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:16.446
I WILL TELL YOU I AND I KNOW

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.616
IT'S A SMALL STEP FORWARD BUT

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.084
FRANKLY FOR A PROGRAM THAT.

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.087
IS ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD --

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.422
AND WITH THE SUPPORT THAT IS

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.057
RECEIVED OVER THE YEARS --

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:32.996
THE THAT IT HAS DONE A MISSION --

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.130
I AM VERY PROUD THAT THIS

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.065
GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN A LOT OF

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:36.533
STEPPED IN FACT FRANKLY FOR THE

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:37.967
FIRST TIME --

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.703
IN MY HISTORY WITH THIS PROGRAM

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.438
AND I WAS THERE WHEN GOVERNOR

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.605
DAVIS SIGNED IT --

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.407
TOOK A FEW YEARS OFF THERE IN

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:45.341
THE MIDDLE AND AND BACK UNDER

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:47.911
GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEW

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:48.778
SOME -- VERY

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.513
PROUD THAT WE'VE TAKEN STEPS

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:51.948
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME JUST

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:53.216
LAST COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE MET

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.984
WITH HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION.

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.386
AND THEY'RE TAKING A VERY ACTIVE

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:58.021
ROLE IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:55:58.088 --> 00:56:09.933
WE HIT THOSE FIRST TIME MOTHERS

00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:10.700
THAT.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:11.735
THAT TO ME THAT'S THAT WHO THAT

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:12.769
NUCLEAR PLACE IF WE CAN GET TO

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:13.336
THOSE MOTHERS WE CAN GET TO

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.437
THOSE FAMILIES WHEN THEY FIRST

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:15.038
COME TO THE DOOR TO LET THEM

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:15.572
KNOW.

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:16.573
THESE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:17.507
AVAILABLE TO THEM THIS IS NOT A

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:18.508
A GOVERNMENT HANDOUT IT'S NOT

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:19.709
EVEN A A TAX PAID TO THE STATE

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:20.210
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:21.111
THAT EVENTUALLY TRICKLES BACK

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.479
DOWN TO THEM THIS IS A DIRECT

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:23.046
FEE THAT THEY PAY FOR THIS

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:23.346
PROGRAM --

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.280
AND WE HAVE TO DO OUR BEST TO

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.449
MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:30.186
NO SITE I SHARE YOUR PASSION FOR

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:32.021

IF YOU FINISH YOUR SNACK A

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:35.892

I HAD OFFER PATERNITY LEAVE AND

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:16.132
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT MEN AND

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.835
PATERNITY LEAVE AND WE WERE

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:20.069

00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:25.208
IS.

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.544
KIND OF SEAMLESS WHEN WE TALK TO

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.246
MY SON IN LAW.

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:31.214
AS A MALE.

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.616
TRYING TO BOND WITH HIS WITH HIS

00:57:33.683 --> 00:57:35.385
SON -- THEY

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:37.353
TOLD MAYBE IT TO WAIT A WEEK SO

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.488
IF YOU KNOW THE EARLY DATE THE

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:39.856
EARLY TIME IS THEN AND THEY

00:57:39.923 --> 00:57:42.792
EXPECTED HIM. TO DELAY HIS

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.027
BINDING BECAUSE THAT'S A MALE

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:47.363
THING. TO DO AND IT HAD PROBABLY

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.465
AT THE MANAGERS THAT GO BACK TO

00:57:49.532 --> 00:57:50.667
THE STONE AGES.

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.168
BACK TO THE FIFTIES WHEN.

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:53.203
WHEN --

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:56.873
MENDED TAKE OFF OR EVEN BOND WAS

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.675
DENIED BECOMING CONCERNED

00:57:58.741 --> 00:57:59.275
BECAUSE SEEM LIKE THEY FROWNED

00:57:59.342 --> 00:57:59.742
UPON.

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:00.777
HIM WANTING TO SPEND SOME TIME

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.478
WITH HIS FAMILY --

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.913
AND I BEEN READING THROUGH THIS

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.448
ICE SAW A LOT OF THINGS

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:06.783
MENTIONING WOMEN AND THEIR

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:09.519
CHILDREN I DIDN'T SEE A WHOLE

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:10.286
LOT OF THAT ABOUT.

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:12.922
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE --

00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.191
PATERNITY LEAVE THIS IS FAIR AND

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.426
EQUAL EQUAL OUT.

00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:17.493
WHETHER YOUR PUBLIC SECTOR

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.863
PRIVATE SECTOR EVEN ACROSS

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:20.430
DIFFERENT LINES WE HAVE A

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.532
COLLEAGUE THAT'S OUT RIGHT NOW

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:24.634
THAT HOPEFULLY WE RETURNING.

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.202
AND NEXT MONTH.

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.538
AND NO ONE'S EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.139
HAVING HIM COME BACK EARLY ARE

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.008
OR HE NEEDS TO DO THIS OR HE

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:33.243
NEEDS TO DO THAT BECAUSE I'M IN

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.744
AND I'M IN AN ENVIRONMENT.

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:37.647
THAT PRAISES AND SUPPORTS UP

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.282
PATERNITY LEAVE --

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.417
SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF WE'D EVEN

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:43.386
LOOKED AT WAYS WE CAN MAKE

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.388
ENSURE THAT PUCK TOURNEY THE

00:58:45.455 --> 00:58:48.391
LEAF.

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.960
IS SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.295
THAT WILL HELP LAND BOND WITH

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:53.229
THEIR WITH THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:53.863
AND THAT THEY HAVE KIND OF THE

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:54.797
SAME.

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:59.302
RIGHTS AND BENEFITS OR IF THERE.

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:00.870
THERE'S SOME PREJUDICE TOWARDS

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:02.238
THEM DO DOING THAT IF THERE'S

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:03.706
ANY SAFETY VALVES AND THAT OR WE

00:59:03.773 --> 00:59:04.207
JUST AT THE WHIM FROM.

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:06.042
COMPANY TO COMPANY A COMPANY A

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:08.077
COMPANY OR THIS AGENCY DOES

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:09.679
SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN THE

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.080
OTHER AGENCY --

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.348
LIKE I SAID MY DAUGHTER AND I

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.350
WERE WE'RE TALKING AS IF.

00:59:14.417 --> 00:59:16.052
I HAD THE SAME BENEFITS AS HER

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:19.289
AND WOULD IS AGO WHEN WHEN I HAD

00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:23.359
HER AND SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S IT'S

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.294
A IS IT JUST.

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.061
ME TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD

00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.863
HER IT JUST IT JUST AMAZING TO

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.465
ME HOW --

00:59:29.532 --> 00:59:32.001
IT'S AMAZINGLY DIFFERENT.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:33.236
I AGREE THAT MISTER JONES SAWYER

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.637
FACT I I'VE BEEN PROUD THAT

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.072
WE'VE TAKEN SOME OF THE MONEY AS

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.273
I MENTIONED EARLIER TO DO

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.741
OUTRAGE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:41.244
THE LARGEST INCREASE --

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:41.444
IN --

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:42.512
FATHERS.

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:43.746
STARTING TO TAKE LEAVE AND I

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.949
WILL TELL YOU I I BELIEVE IT'S

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:47.417
ACTUALLY MORE OF THAT STIGMA.

00:59:47.483 --> 00:59:49.018
A CULTURAL IN SOCIETY THAT IS

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.853
VERY HARD FOR GOVERNMENT TO

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:52.522
CHANGE ATTITUDES ABOUT.

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:55.758
BUT IT IS A WORTHWHILE PRACTICE --

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:56.859
HOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME --

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:58.027
COMMERCIALS THAT WE DID

00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:02.198
PARTICULARLY AROUND THAT THAT

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.334
I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:04.801
TO YES YES --

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:05.702
JUST SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE THAT

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.136
BUT BUT YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:07.804
IT'S A LOT MORE AROUND CULTURE --

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.273
WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS I'D LOVE --

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.742
TO SAY THAT --

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:13.810
MUCH LIKE A LOT OF THE UNION

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:16.479
WORKPLACES I WORKED IN VALUE --

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.047
THE SIMILAR TYPE BENEFITS FOR

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:19.816
BOTH OF MALE AND FEMALE WORKERS

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:22.018
BUT OFTENTIMES THAT'S NOT THAT

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:22.685
THINK THAT LA --

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.587
SPOKEN THEIR REPORT --

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:28.458
TO SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE THE

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.959
LAW -- THIS

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.928
STILL LEAVES ITSELF OPEN --

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.264
FOR DESIRE FOR CHANGE.

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.933
INTERPRETATION.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.166
YES SIR.

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:39.335
THANK YOU.

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.636
I HAD A QUESTION OUTRAGE LOSING

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.704
ALL MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL SO I I

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.773
APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.174
ONE THING YOU MENTIONED --

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.909
OF THE DIRECTOR IS WORKING WITH

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.712
THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHEN --

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:50.313
THE MOTHERS GIVING BIRTH THE

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.314
MAYBE CAN EXTEND THAT EVEN

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.715
FURTHER TALK OF THE DOCTORS ON

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.250
THE PRENATAL CHECKUPS ALL THAT

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:55.585
SO WELL IN ADVANCE.

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:56.853
I WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE --

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:58.488
OUR PARTNERS IN THE CMA OUT OF

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:01.691
IT I I WOULD ALSO SAY --

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:04.060
THE SEE AND A OKAY WELL --

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:07.330
WE'VE DONE SOME OUTRAGE FOR THEM

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.298
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE WITH BOTH

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.833
THAT -- THEY

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.435
OFTENTIMES FIND THEMSELVES AS

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.971
PROTECTION PRACTITIONERS.

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.173
OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.274
TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.343
SYSTEM BUT I I AGREE WE WE CAN

01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:21.644
STILL DO MORE.

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:22.912
AGAIN WE'VE DONE A LOT WITH THE

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:24.380
DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE WERE STILL

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.549
TRICKLING SOME OF THOSE --

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.051
DOLLARS AND LESSONS LEARNED.

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:30.753
OUT -- BUT

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.789
AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE EXPENDED ALL

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.924
THE FUNDS WE HAVE REPORT THAT'S

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:35.992
UP ON OUR WEBSITE IF ANYBODY.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.060
WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE'VE

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.528
DONE AND WHAT THE NUMBERS WE

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:39.162
RECEIVE FROM THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:39.629
UPTICK.

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.864
THE OVERALL UTILIZATION AS WELL

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.332
AS AS I SAID TO MISTER JONES

01:01:43.399 --> 01:01:45.301
SAWYER IN PARTICULAR.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.202
FOR A PATERNAL.

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:49.038
FATHERS USING THE SYSTEM BUT I I

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.707
COMPLETELY FOR THEIR VERY

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:52.608
DIFFERENT.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:54.310
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REALLY HAVE

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:55.344
KAISER --

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:56.846
THE SOCCER --

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.247
AND A FEW OTHER --

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:58.915
HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SOUTHERN

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:00.683
CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH DIFFERENT

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.385
STORY BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:04.620
DIFFERENCE OF PEOPLE GIVING CARE

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.590
DOWN THE WHAT THE STEP WILL BE A

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:08.558
TEAM EFFORT I I THINK --

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:09.659
WITH ALL INVOLVES APPRECIATE

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.227
THAT AND THEN ONE QUESTION

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.796
ALEJO'S OFFICE REGARDING BECAUSE

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.464
I THINK IT'S PASSING IN THE HOLD

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.433
THE THE THE CONCEPTUAL PROPOSALS

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:25.408
OF THE SHARABLE ON TRANSFERABLE --

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.443
LEAVE OF A TEAM THE PARTNER'S

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:28.244
WHAT HAVE YOU --

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.779
OR EVEN SINGLE PARENTS TOOK

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.013
DOESN'T CLOSE RELATIVES OF THE

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.782
AYE IN CONCEPT A GREAT HOW THAT

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:33.349
ACTUALLY WORK TECHNICALLY.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:34.650
THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE THE

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:39.255
DISABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM OR

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:39.889
IS THAT SOMETHING WE HAD THAT WE

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.991
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.059
IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT THAT THE

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.127
ADMINISTRATION SOME IN A BETTER

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.094
POSITION TO SPEAK TO THIS BUT IN

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.829
IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH.

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:47.763
THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE PART OF

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:48.698
FINANCE AND WITH OTHERS ONE OF

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:51.267
THE KEY CONCERNS THAT THAT CAME

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.935
OUT VERY EARLY ON WAS THAT THESE

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.370
MORE.

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.805
I'LL CALL THEM UNIQUE POLICY

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.573
OPTIONS TRANSFER ABILITY

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.342
FLEXIBILITY.

01:02:59.408 --> 01:03:01.410
WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.980
TIME FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BUILD

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.515
NEW TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO DO

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:08.117
THESE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.685
GOVERNOR HAS AS IN A WAY RE

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:10.786
FRAMED.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:20.897
HOW WE THINK ABOUT PAID FAMILY

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.698
LEAVE HE'S FRAMED IT AS --

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:24.534
SIX MONTHS OF LEAVE. FOR THE

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:24.767
CHILD.

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:25.368
BUT HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.135
OPERATED A PROGRAM AND HENCE

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.003
TECHNOLOGY AROUND OPERATING A

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.404
PROGRAM THAT IS SIX WEEKS OF

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.906
LEAVE. FOR AN EMPLOYEE --

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:30.973
AND THAT FOR INSTANCE.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.542
IT'S NOT CLEAR WE WERE UNABLE TO

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.743
IDENTIFY.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.211
SUS LINKING UP A PARTICULAR

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:36.045
MOTHER AND A PARTICULAR FATHER

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.281
OF THE SAME CHILD WHO WILL TAKE

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.283
LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME WE WE

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.384
DON'T TRACK THE THAT INFORMATION

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.320
ON THING SOME OF THESE MORE

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.488
UNIQUE.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.423
OPTIONS THE ONLY THING I WOULD

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.724
FLAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:50.626
SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGY CHANGES

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.894
WERE RE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.596
PROGRAM I THINK THE FALLS.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.097
REALLY CLOSELY IN LINE WITH.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:55.598
WHAT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:56.966
LEGISLATURE JUST THINK ABOUT

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.234
THESE OPTIONS THERE ARE TRADE

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.102
OFFS MAYBE IT TAKES LONGER BUT

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:00.803
IF IT'S SOMETHING THE

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.471
LEGISLATURES TO INTEREST IN

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:03.406
DOING AND?

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:04.974
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A APPOINT START

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:05.841
THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK YOU

01:04:06.742 --> 01:04:07.510
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:08.744
GOVERNOR'S REFRAMING OF THIS

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.913
AROUND THE CHILD AND WHETHER

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.248
IT'S A PARENT.

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.749
OR A CLOSE RELATIVE ALIGNED

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.351
OPTION FOR THAT CHILD DURING A

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.220

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:33.996
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE HI MY

NAME IS CURTIS CHEN FOR THE PAST

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.435

FAMILIES PRIMARILY IN SAN

I ALSO SERVED AS DEPUTY HEALTH

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:45.508
OFFICER FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:46.876
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:48.911
ALSO MEDICAL DIRECTOR MATERNAL

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.646
CHILD ADOLESCENT HEALTH --

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.548
IN ALL THESE HATS I WHERE I

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.317
BELONG TO SEVERAL HEALTH

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:57.320
ORGANIZATIONS AND SEVERAL STATE

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.688
Y. CHILDREN'S ORGANIZATIONS.

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.456
AND MY TWENTY YEARS I HAVE NEVER

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.191
SEEN SO MANY STATEWIDE

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:05.027
ORGANIZATIONS COME TOGETHER FOR

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:06.195
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.197
SO THEY'VE ALL COME TOGETHER FOR

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.533
THIS CONCEPT IN CENTRAL COMMON

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.668
AGENDA CALLED EQUAL RIGHTS FOR

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.869
PARENTAL LEAVE.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.238
BECAUSE OF THIS IMPACT ON CHILD

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.074
DEVELOPMENT AND THE OVERALL

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.210
HEALTH OF FAMILIES OVER THE LIFE

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:22.678
COURSE.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:23.846
SO AT THE LEGISLATIVE.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.948
ANALYST'S HAVE EXPLAINED THERE

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.750
ARE HUNDREDS OF ARTICLES AND

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.985
THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.454
WIDELY ESTABLISHED.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.489
HEALTH BENEFITS OF ANY SINGLE

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.424
PUBLIC POLICY SO ALTHOUGH

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.660
THERE'S RELATIVE TO SOME MEDICAL

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.729
LITERATURE RELATIVE TO FOR

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.130
EXAMPLE CANCER THERAPEUTICS.

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:42.598
THERE'S SME LACK OF CLARITY ON

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.633
THE ACTUAL IMPACT A RELATIVE TO

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.269
OTHER SOCIAL ECONOMIC POLICIES

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.170
THE HIT THE HEALTH IMPACT OF

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.139
THIS IS EXTREMELY STRONG.

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.507
THIS IS WHY SO MANY HEALTH

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:54.076
ORGANIZATIONS ARE STRONGLY IN

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.511
FAVOR OF THIS.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.447
SO IN ADDITION TO THE ANALYSIS

01:06:58.514 --> 01:06:59.682
FROM THE FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:00.516
FROM ALEJO.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.651
I JUST PUT IT INTO FIVE OVERALL

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:04.487
OVER ARCHING FRAMEWORKS THAT

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:05.988
PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.790
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.025
EMPHASIZING FOR THE LAST DECADE.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.395
SO THERE'S FIVE OF THEM SO ONE

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:14.530
OF THEM IS THAT A P. PRIME TO

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:17.333
LEAVE REDUCES TOXIC STRESS.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.801
PARTICULARLY FOR LOW WAGE

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.035
FAMILIES --

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:22.605
AND THIS IS EVIDENT IN --

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.573
THAT SHOWS WHEN WE PASSED THE

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.409
PAID FAMILY LEAVE POLICY THERE

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:27.877
WAS THE ACTUAL DROP.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:30.246
IN INCIDENTS OF HEAD TRAUMA DUE

01:07:30.312 --> 01:07:31.781
TO ABUSE.

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.616
THIS IS AN EVIDENCE THIS IS

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.684
EVIDENCE OF ACTUALLY REDUCING

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.953
TOP EXPRESS AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.523
EXPERIENCES ACES ON CHILDREN.

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.491
THERE'S NO OTHER PUBLIC POLICY

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.026
THE HAS THAT TYPE OF REACH

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:47.062
NUMBER TWO MATERNAL MENTAL

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:47.296
HEALTH.

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:48.564
THIS.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.533
PAY PARENTAL LEAVE ACTUALLY

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:52.268
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.203
SYMPTOMS OF POST PARTUM

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.305
DEPRESSION I HAVE AND ALSO

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.307
PRENATAL DEPRESSION AS WELL.

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.775
AND WE SEE THAT THERE SEVERAL

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:02.011
FOLDS INCREASED IN POST PARTUM

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:04.346
DEPRESSION MOST LOW WAGE EARNERS

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:05.881
PURSES HIGH WAGE EARNERS.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.683
THE FIFTY THIRD ISSUE IN THE

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.285
LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZE THE

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:10.686
IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.121
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT.

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:14.523
THE FIRST TWELVE WEEKS THE FIRST

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.825
SIX MONTHS THEN EVEN EXTENDING

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.193
TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS ARE

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:20.296
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:21.530
FOR EARLY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.432
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT SOCIAL

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.301
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND THIS

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:27.536
LEADS TO A LIFE COURSE OF

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:30.272
LEARNING IN KINDERGARTEN

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.373
READINESS.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.541
THE FOURTH ISSUE IS LIFE COURSE

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:33.742
THEORY.

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:35.077
SO THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS OF

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.679
LIFE COURSE THEORY IN WHICH PAID

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:37.980
PARENTAL LEAVE.

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:39.615
PARTICULARLY --

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.884
STRENGTHENS THE FIRST ASPECT IS

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.586
REACH.

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.120
THERE'S NO OTHER POLICY IN WHICH

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:47.723
EVERY HUMAN BORN IN CALIFORNIA

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.925
WILL BE REACHED EVERY BABY IN

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:52.795
EVERY SET OF PARENTS.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:54.296
THE SECOND IS THERE IS A

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.999
CRITICAL WINDOW OF VULNERABILITY.

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.034
OBVIOUSLY FOR A NEWBORN INFANTS

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:01.470
UP TO SIX TO NINE MONTHS BUT

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.539
ALSO THIS IS THE PERIOD OF

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:04.773
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.009
PHYSIOLOGICALLY FOR THE WOMAN

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:09.245
AND ALSO THIS IS THE GREATEST --

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.480
VULNERABILITY IN POST PARTUM

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:13.349
DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HEALTH --

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:14.817
ISSUES.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:17.453
AND THE THIRD ASPECT IS THAT

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.221
FROM A LIFE COURSE PERSPECTIVE.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.290
SCIENCE HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.325
INTERVIEW INTERVENING AT THIS

01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:25.528
EARLY STAGE FOR BOTH BABIES AND

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.796
MOTHERS AND FATHERS.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:30.399
IS GOING TO LEAD TO A TRAJECTORY

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.835
THAT LASTS AN ENTIRE LIFETIME

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.703
PARTICULARLY IF THIS IS A POLICY

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.972
THAT AFFECTS EVERYBODY AND EVERY

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.440
COMMUNITY.

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:41.176
THE FIFTH AND FINAL --

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:43.479
HEALTH PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:45.214
THAT THIS ADDRESSES RACIAL

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:48.017
INEQUITIES AND RACISM.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.518
SO CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.253
STATES THE UTILIZATION OF

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.055
PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY IS AN

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.623
EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED BY WAGE

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.558
LEVEL.

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:57.860
AND REYES WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.261
IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY THE

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.730
AVAILABILITY OF WAGE REPLACEMENT

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.499
IN UNITED STATES.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:05.334
WHEREAS WE RECOGNIZE OUR MANY

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:06.902
LONG STANDING HISTORICAL AND

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:08.404
STRUCTURAL REASONS FOR THESE

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.039
INEQUITIES.

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.574
IT'S REALLY A QUESTION FOR ALL

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.843
OF US AS A STATE IS HOW DO WE

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:31.327
NOW INSURER.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.861
IN EQUAL STARTING LINE FOR ALL

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:33.796
CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:34.096
[inaudible]

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.598
SO -- IN THE

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.231
AGREEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:36.532
ANALYSIS --

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.300
ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH IMPACT --

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:41.070
MEDICAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:43.205
THAT'S WIDENING IN THE UNITED

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:45.674
STATES BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:49.111
IN UPTAKE OF A PARENTAL LEAVE.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.080
FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN COLLEGE

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.381
OF OBSTETRICIANS AND

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.650
GYNECOLOGISTS WHO SEE.

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:57.286
PRETTY MUCH NEARLY A 100% OF ALL

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.588
WOMEN IN PRENATAL CARE.

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:02.858
EMPHASIZE A POLICY STATEMENT. TO

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:06.662
EMPHASIZE 1100% PAID PARENTAL

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:07.963
LEAVE IS.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.232
THE POLICY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.600
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:14.303
AND THE POLICY STATEMENT TWO

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.071
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HIGHLIGHTS THE

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.539
IMPACT OF PARENTAL LEAVE.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.475
ON THE MANY WOMEN ESPECIALLY

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:20.809
THOSE WHO WORK FOR SMALLER

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:23.979
COMPANIES HISPANICS LOWER WAGE

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:26.382
EARNERS AND THOSE WITH LESS THAN

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:27.916
A COLLEGE EDUCATION.

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:30.619
THEY'VE RECOGNIZE HAVING LESS

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.388
ACCESS TO PAID LEAVE.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.589
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES IN WHICH

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.391
THOSE.

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:37.793
COMMUNITIES A MIGHT MAKE

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.695
POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE

01:11:39.762 --> 01:11:40.796
FOR THEM TO HAVE AN EQUAL

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.231
OPPORTUNITY.

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:43.732
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.168
OPPORTUNITY FOR A BABY.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:49.471
AT SIX TEN TWELVE WEEKS OLD TO

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:50.773
BE WITH HER.

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.808
MOTHER OR THEIR FATHER THIS IS

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:54.877
THE MOST BASIC OF HUMAN

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:57.012
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:58.881
FURTHERMORE THE MERIT ECONOMY A

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:01.483
PEDIATRICS WHICH WHICH ARE

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.085
SUGGESTED PORTRAITS OF OUTREACH

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.753
NOT IN PREMIER KERR BUT ALSO IN

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.055
PEDIATRIC CARE.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.956
FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE ISSUE OF

01:12:08.023 --> 01:12:11.026
EQUITY AND PAID LEAVE SO THIS IS

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:11.994
THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:13.462
ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.999
SAID THE MOST PARENTS CANNOT OF

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.133
OTHER CHILDREN.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.902
IT'S THE CHILDREN WHO SUFFER THE

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:20.969
MOST.

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.204
ALL PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.706
BOND WITH AND CARE FOR THEIR

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:24.707
YOUNG CHILDREN.

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:26.909
DURING THE FIRST CRITICAL MONTHS

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.144
OF LIFE.

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:31.714
SO I APPRECIATE THE DILEMMAS

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.981
THAT THE STATE HAS IN FRONT OF A

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:37.052
AS IN FRONT OF US THERE'S A LOT

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:40.055
AND FOR THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF A

01:12:40.122 --> 01:12:42.324
NUMBER OF WEEKS PERCENTAGE OF

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:45.861
WHAT WAIT REPLACEMENT --

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.696
PATERNITY LEAVE FORCES MATERNITY

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.765
LEAVE AND THE OUTREACH ISSUE

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:51.633
THOSE FOUR ISSUES I WOULD JUST

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.602
PUT ON THE LANDS OF RACIAL

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:55.337
EQUITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY.

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:57.372
SO THE FIRST THE FIRST ONE IS

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:58.640
THE DURATION.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.542
SO WE APPRECIATE THERE'S A LOT

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:01.977
OF DISCUSSION OF TWELVE WEEKS

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.047
WHICH IS THREE MONTHS PLUS IF --

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:08.350
THE BABY HAS A A SECOND PARENT

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.085
THAT WOULD ADD UP TO SIX MONTHS.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:11.820
IT WE SHOULD STILL BE CLEAR THAT

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:13.322
THE HEALTH COMMUNITY BELIEVES

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:15.657
THAT SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.826
IS THE RIGHT TIME SO THAT IS

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.828
WHAT'S --

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.430
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:13:21.497 --> 01:13:23.165
AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STILL

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.400
ASKING FOR SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:28.437
SO I WE REALIZE THAT IT'S WE IN

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:31.340
THE HEALTH PROFESSION TO FINANCE

01:13:31.406 --> 01:13:31.874
THAT.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.375
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S MOST

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.410
BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN AND

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:36.245
FAMILIES.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.347
SO FROM A PEDIATRICS PERSPECTIVE

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:39.848
IT FOR THINKING ABOUT MY THREE

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:42.618
KIDS SIX MONTHS IS THE TIME FOR

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.186
EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.554
THE TIME THE WINDOW FOR POST

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.456
PARTUM DEPRESSION THE RISK

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.191
PERIOD FOR SUDDEN INFANT DEATH

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.893
SYNDROME OCCURS UNTIL NINE

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.394
MONTHS SO THOSE ARE THE

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:56.131
PARTICULAR REASONS HE SCRATCHED

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.033
OUT TO THE WHL --

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:58.834
EXPECTS US TO HAVE SPREAD TO

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:01.336
LEAVE UNTIL TWENTY SIX WEEKS SO --

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.672
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A THE WINDOW

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:06.208
THE TIME FRAME IS SIX TO TWELVE

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.309
MONTHS --

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.911
THE SECOND ISSUE IS WAIT

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:12.181
REPLACEMENT IS ACTUALLY A SOCIAL

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:14.449
CLASS EQUITY ISSUE.

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.618
AND THERE'S MANY FACTORS I WOULD

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.187
SAY SIX TO TEN FANTASTIC

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.222
PROFESSORS IN CALIFORNIA CORE

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.624
NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL LEADERS

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:23.959
IN THE HEALTH IMPACT OF P.

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:26.028
PARENTAL LEAVE. ONE OF THEM IS

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:28.864
AT STANFORD MY A RASS US LATER.

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:32.134
AND SHE A HIGHLIGHTED IN A TWO

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.035
THOUSAND ELEVEN ARTICLE IN THE

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.003
JOURNAL HEALTH ECONOMICS THAT

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:40.142
FMO LA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MINOR

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:41.743
IMPROVEMENTS AND BIRTH WEIGHT.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:42.911
MP MATURITY WEIGHT AS WELL AS A

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.746
DECREASE IT INTO MORTALITY

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:45.314
MEASURE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:45.514
LIFE.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.182
THE ONLY AMONG COLLEGE EDUCATED

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.617
WHITE MOTHERS.

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:49.518
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS THE UNITED

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:53.422
STATES WHEN WE EIGHT RESOURCES

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.958
ONLY FOR A PARTICULAR PRIVILEGED

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.960
POPULATION.

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.561
SO THE THIRD AND FINAL THE THIRD

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.897
AN ALMOST FINAL ISSUE IS THE

01:15:01.964 --> 01:15:03.298
DISTRIBUTION DOUBLE OF LEAVE.

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.067
BY GENDER WHEN I'M REVIEWING

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.535
THESE ARTICLES OF THE

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.904
INTERESTING ASPECT AS I I

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:10.672
APPRECIATE THE LA ILLS --

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:12.708
ANALYSIS IS A WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.409
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IN NORWAY

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:17.512
SWEDEN GERMANY AT EACH INTERVAL

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.381
INCREASE IN.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.650
PATERNITY LEAVE OR AND SENATORS

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:22.251
AND PATERNITY LEAVE.

01:15:22.317 --> 01:15:24.887
THERE'S A IMPORTANT ASPECTS ON

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:27.256
FAMILY DYNAMICS FATHER'S

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:30.859
RESPONSIBILITY --

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.594
TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD IT TO BE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.729
ENGAGE WITH A CHILD'S

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.931
DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AT THE

01:15:35.998 --> 01:15:52.948
SOCIAL DYNAMICS BETWEEN.

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:53.916
THE TWO PARTNERS SO IT'S

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.117
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THERE

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:55.717
TO BE ADEQUATE INCENTIVES FOR

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:56.985
THE HIGHER WAGE EARNERS IN SOME

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.020
CASES THEY MAY BE THE FATHERS.

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.221
TO BE ALSO BE TAKING LEAVE AS

01:15:59.288 --> 01:15:59.821
WELL.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.690
AND THE FOURTH AND FINAL COMMENT

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.992
I HAVE IS REGARDING OUT REACH

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:06.895
PUBLIC HEALTH HOSPITAL'S

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:08.830
PEDIATRICIANS --

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.934
OBGYN ENDS HAVE ALL STOOD FIRM

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.936
AND ARE ALL ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.771
PARTICIPATING THERE ARE MANY

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.273
CREATIVE WAYS IN WHICH OUT WHICH

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.708
CAN BE DONE THROUGH COMMUNITY

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.443
BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.211
CLOSELY WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.147
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.683
AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS --

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:30.385
WE THINK THAT OUTREACH IS

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:32.387
IMPORTANT METHOD TO ENSURE THAT

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.856
ALL FAMILIES UNDERSTAND THE

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.458
COMPLEXITIES.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:39.261
THE AVAILABILITY OF A PARENTAL

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:42.431
LEAVE AND OVERALL PROCESS OF

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:43.765
ACTUALLY.

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:45.734
APPLYING AND RECEIVING THOSE

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:46.835
BENEFITS.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:48.537
SO -- IS SO

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.839
IN SUMMARY I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:53.342
YOUR TIME YOUR INTERESTS --

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.843
THIS IS THAT --

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.980
FINAL FRONTIER THIS IS THE FINAL

01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:00.983
FRONTIER WHICH WERE WAY BEHIND.

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:02.884
IN TERMS OF SOCIAL POLICIES ALL

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.720
INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.688
THIS UNFORTUNATELY HAS THE

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.256
BIGGEST IMPACT FROM A LIFE

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:10.759
COURSE PERSPECTIVE ON CHILDREN

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.194
AND FAMILIES.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.395
SO WE LOOK AT IT WE IN THE

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.997
HEALTH COMMITTEE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:16.331
WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:18.033
UPCOMING YEAR TO ENSURE THERE'S

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.101
A POLICY.

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:24.006
THAT CARES FOR ALL CHILDREN AND

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:24.840
FAMILIES THANK YOU.

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.609
THANK YOU DOCTOR CAN.

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:28.243
I JUST HAD ONE QUICK QUESTION I

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.877
KNOW WE'VE GOT OTHER PRESENTERS

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.611
BUT I'D ASK A QUESTION TO THE LA --

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:30.712
BEFORE ABOUT WHETHER YOU COULD

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.448
PROJECT ANYTHING ABOUT --

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:36.451
THE IMPACTS ON HEALTH CARE COSTS

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:38.086
OF INVESTING NOW.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.154
AS WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE IF YOU

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:39.755
WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER BILLION

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:40.989
DOLLARS AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:42.624
AGAIN WE ALL INTUITIVELY BELIEVE

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:43.959
THAT THAT WILL SAVE.

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:45.360
LOTS OF DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:48.764
AND YOU SPECIFIC HEALTH BENEFITS

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.132
THAT COME OUT THAT WE KNOW IF

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.633
YOU COMPARE COHORT OF FOLKS.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.535
WHO HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.137
VERSUS FAMILIES THAT DON'T WHAT

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.872
THE LONGER TERM HEALTH IMPACTS

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:57.739
ARE?

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:58.440
IS THERE ENOUGH IN THE

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.208
LITERATURE TO THINK TO ANALYZE

01:18:00.275 --> 01:18:02.811
WHAT THE INVESTMENTS.

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.346
LEADS TO AS FAR AS LONGER TERM

OUR CLIENTS HAVE REALLY GIVEN US

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.255
INSIGHT INTO THE CURRENT GAPS IN

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:20.956

WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:30.632
CALIFORNIA WHERE SHIN.

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:31.800
AND SO WITH OUR PARTNERS WE

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:32.534
REALLY FOCUS ON HOW OUR LOW

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.201
INCOME WORKERS BEING LEFT BEHIND

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.003
IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:36.071
SO TODAY I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:37.205
THREE SPECIFIC BARRIERS THAT WE

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:38.807
SEE COME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.142
WHICH WE HOPE WILL BE KEPT IN

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.176
MIND WE'RE CONSIDERING AN

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.612
EXPANSION OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.613
TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.948
NOT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:47.716
THAT WOULD INCREASE THAN

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:50.285
EQUITIES WE SEE IN THE PROGRAM.

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:51.887
SO THE FIRST ONE SEVEN

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.122
CALIFORNIA ARE JOB PROTECTION IN

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:56.091
INCOME REPLACEMENT LAWS ARE NOT

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.292
WELL LINE.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.427
WHICH MEANS MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.363
DENIED ACCESS THE FAMILY LEAVE

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.331
OR HAVE TO CUT THEIR LEAVE SHORT.

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:04.232
SEVEN AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:05.767
TODAY THE CALIFORNIA'S PAID

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.102
FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM VIRTUALLY

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.937
COVERS ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYEES IN

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:10.739
THE STATE AND ALLOWS AN ACCESS

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:11.806
SIX WEEKS.

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.475
OF INCOME REPLACEMENT WHILE

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.843
THEY'RE CARING FOR A NEW CHILD

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.244
OR CARING FOR A SERIOUSLY ILL

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.479
FAMILY MEMBER.

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.114
THE PROBLEM IS THE ENTIRELY

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.815
EMPLOYEE FUNDED PROGRAM ONLY

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:22.284
PROVIDES MONETARY BENEFITS IT

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.219
DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SORT OF JOB

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.387
PROTECTION.

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.322
THIS MEANS YOU CAN BE FIRED

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:31.092
LEGALLY FOR ACCESSING BENEFITS

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.727
YOU PAY.

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:33.828
FOR THAT'S BECAUSE OUR JOB

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.664
PROTECTION LAWS THE CALIFORNIA

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:36.565
FAMILY RIGHTS ACT --

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.133
A LOT THE WHICH ALLOWS WORKERS

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.501
TO TAKE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.169
JOB PROTECTED BUT UNPAID TIME

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:42.871

CHILD ONLY APPLIES TO EMPLOYEES

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.446
WHO WORK AT COMPANIES WITH FIFTY

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.882
OR MORE EMPLOYEES WITHIN A

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:54.449
SEVENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:55.483
HAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.952
YEAR AND YOU HAD TO WORK A TOTAL

01:20:57.018 --> 01:20:59.688
OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:00.355
FIFTY HOURS IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:01.389
YOUR LEAVE.

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:03.825
NOTHING SAYS SENATOR JACKSON --

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:07.996
SB ANY EIGHTEEN DID EXPAND THIS

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.731
JOB PROTECTION FOR NEW PARENTS

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.233
DOWN TO A TWENTY EMPLOYEE

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.234
THRESHOLDS.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.268
HOWEVER THIS STILL LEAVES

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:15.170
WORKERS WHO WORK FOR SMALLER

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:16.738
COMPANIES BELOW TWENTY OR WHO

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.173
WORK PART TIME OR WHO HAVEN'T

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.407
BEEN THERE YEAR.

01:21:19.474 --> 01:21:21.109
VERY VULNERABLE WHEN A NEW TRIAL

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:22.477
COMES INTO THEIR LIFE OR FAMILY

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.246
MEMBER GETS STALE THEY HAVE NO

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:25.914
RIGHT TO TAKE ANY TIME OFF OF

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:26.982
WORK.

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:28.683
UNFORTUNATELY LOW WAGE WORKERS

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.085
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LESS

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.519
LIKELY TO BE COVERED BY THESE

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:33.288
JOB PROTECTIONS.

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:33.922
AND WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:35.557
COLOR IS TO HEAR ABOUT PAID

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.492
FAMILY LEAVE WHICH IN ITSELF IS

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.159
A GREAT THING THAT THEY'VE HEARD

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:38.860
OF IT.

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:39.928
AND THEY GO TO TELL THEIR

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:41.263
EMPLOYER THEY WANT TO TAKE THESE

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.864
BENEFITS AND THEY'RE SHOCKED TO

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:45.467
FIND OUT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:46.368
THE RIGHT TO DO SO.

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.335
A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN SURVEY

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.737
FOUND THAT ALMOST TWO OUT OF

01:21:48.803 --> 01:21:50.038
FIVE EMPLOYEES WERE WHO ARE

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.373
ELDERLY USED VIA FILE.

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:52.907
CHOSE NOT TO APPLY FOR BECAUSE

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.210
THEY FEARED LOSING THEIR JOB OR

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:57.012
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.614
SO ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE IS

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:00.815
THE DURATION A EVER ARE JOB

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.183
PROTECTION ARE PAID ON MATCH UP

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.418
IS THE DURATION OF LEAVE LIKE I

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.687
SAID OUR JOB PROTECTION LAWS.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.656
ALLOW FOR TWELVE WEEKS OF TIME

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.324
OFF WATER PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.992
PROGRAM OFF ONLY AFTER SIX WEEKS

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.193
OF BENEFITS.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.695
NOW FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS WERE

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.030
LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:16.865
OTHER FORMS OF PAID LEAVE THIS

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:17.799
MEANS THEY HAVE TO CUT THEIR

01:22:17.866 --> 01:22:19.701
LEAVE SHORT BECAUSE I CAN'T

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.269
AFFORD IT --

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.637
IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:25.440
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND CHILDCARE FOR

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.675
A SIX WEEK HERE OLD.

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.310
AND THEREFORE --

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:30.178
LOW WAGE WORKERS PARTICULARLY A

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.947
I PARTICULARLY WOMEN WE SEE OUR

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:37.952
FAIR MARKET THE JOB MARKET --

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:38.687
YOU REVERSE LEE LIMóN THEIR

01:22:38.753 --> 01:22:40.689
FUTURE EARNING CAPACITY AND

01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.123
CAREER PATH.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.892
LASTLY IF THE DEFINITION OF

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.293
FAMILY MEMBERS WITHIN OUR JOB

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.795
PROTECTION LAWS AND OUR WAITER

01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:49.664
PLACEMENT PROGRAM OR DIFFERENT

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:51.266
SO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE LAW NOW

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.901
COVERS YOUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.302
CIVILIANS GRANDPARENTS

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:55.970
GRANDCHILDREN PARENTS.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.605
PARENTS ALLIES --

01:22:57.672 --> 01:22:59.040
IN ADDITION TO PARENTS SPOUSES

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.109
REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNERS AND

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:02.944
CHILDREN OF ALL AGES --

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:04.245
WHICH IS GREAT AND WE LOVE THAT

01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:05.447
EXPANSIVE DEFINITION BUT

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:06.581
UNFORTUNATELY TO GET JOB

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.049
PROTECTION YOU ONLY HAVE THE

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:09.751
RIGHT TO TAKE JOB PROTECTED

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.453
LEAVE IF IT'S YOUR PARENT.

01:23:11.519 --> 01:23:15.890
AIR SPELLS OR YOUR MINOR CHILD --

01:23:15.957 --> 01:23:17.292
AND SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE A

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.893
FAMILY MEMBER WHO FALLS ILL

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.730
AGAIN CAN GET THESE BENEFITS BUT

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.064
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB TO GO.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.099
TO TERRON THAT'S EXTREMELY

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.433
PROBLEMATIC.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:26.735
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:28.303
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES DO NOT LOOK

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:30.305
THE SAME AS THEY DID DECADES AGO.

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:32.474
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A RECORD SIXTY

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.209
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE OR 20% OF

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.410
THE US POPULATION LIVED WITH

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:37.011
MULTIPLE GENERATIONS UNDER ONE

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.113
ROOF AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:23:38.179 --> 01:23:39.381
SECOND HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:41.015
MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES IN

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:42.550
THE US.

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:43.318
ANOTHER MAJOR BEARISH OUR

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.853
CLIENTS ACCESSING THE PAID

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.254
FAMILY PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:49.290
TOUCHED UPON IS THE CURRENT WAGE

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:49.724
REPLACEMENT RATE.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:50.925
SO IF YOU'RE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:52.727
AND PARTIAL INCOME WON'T ALLOW

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.162
YOU TO PAY THE RENT OR EXPENSES

01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:56.030
ESPECIALLY WITH A NEW BABY IS

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:57.665
JOINING THE HOUSEHOLD.

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.067
ALTHOUGH AB NINE OH EIGHT THE

01:23:59.134 --> 01:23:59.601
BILL THAT RAISE THE WAGE

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.669
REPLACEMENT RATE TO SIXTY OR 70%

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:03.138
WAS A GREAT FIRST THAT.

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.606
IT'S SIMPLY JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR

01:24:04.672 --> 01:24:08.476
MANY WORKERS SO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:09.043
THANKS TO CENTER WIENER IS

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.844
LEADERSHIP THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:11.312
PASSED THE FIRST OF ITS KIND

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.914
PAID PARENTAL LEAVE ORDINANCE.

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.149
THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES EMPLOYERS

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:15.617
AND SAN FRANCISCO TO TOP UP THE

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.419
STATE BENEFITS TO WORKERS IN SAN

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.020
FRANCISCO GET A 100% DURING

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:23.391
THOSE SIX WEEKS --

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.960
FORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN A GREAT

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:27.429
SOME REALLY PROMISING RESULTS

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:28.496
THAT SHOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:29.731
YOU GET TO FULL PAY.

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:31.199
SO EARLY ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.967
INDICATES A 6% INCREASE IN THE

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:34.469
NUMBER OF WOMEN TAKING MONEY

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:46.214
LEAVE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.081
YEAR THE ORGANS WHEN THE FACT

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:47.882
FIRST OF THE FIRST.

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:48.483
HALF OF THE YEAR AND THE YEAR

01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:49.150
PRIOR AND THIS IS A COMPARED TO

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:50.151
VIRTUALLY NO CHANGE IN THE REST

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:50.685
OF THE STATE.

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:51.252
AND THEN MORE INTERESTINGLY

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:53.221
THERE WAS A 28% INCREASE IN MEN

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:53.788
TAKING BONNIE LEAVE AND SAN

01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:54.489
FRANCISCO AS COMPARED TO A THREE

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:57.292
POINT 9% INCREASE OVER ALL --

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.060
IN ANOTHER INTERESTING.

01:24:59.127 --> 01:24:59.994
FINDING FROM THE STUDY IS THAT

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:00.662
78% OF EMPLOYERS REPORTED BE IN

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:01.863
SUPPORT OF OUR VERY SUPPORT OF

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:02.397
OTHER PAID PARENTAL LEAVE

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.866
ORDINANCE WITH ONLY 6% OPPOSE.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:05.934
AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.202
EMPLOYERS REPORTED THAT THEIR

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:08.770
SUPPORT OF THE ORDINANCE BUT

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:10.205
EITHER IMPROVE OR NOT CHANGE IF

01:25:10.271 --> 01:25:11.840
IT WERE FUNDED THROUGH A PAYROLL

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:12.540
TAX.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:13.975
SOMETHING WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:14.943
BE CONSIDERED WHEN EXPLORING

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.778
WAYS TO FUND AN EXPANSION OF THE

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:20.849
PROGRAM AND HOW WE PAY FOR IT.

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.217
SO THE FINAL BARRIER WHICH I

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.518
THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IS

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:26.087
SIMPLY THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:27.255
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND THERE'S

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:28.857
WIDESPREAD CONFUSION BECAUSE AS

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.492
I JUST EXPLAINED.

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:32.193
OUR PAYS THE PAPER VERSION AND

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.761
THE JOB REDUCTION THEY DON'T

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:34.362
LINE UP AND THEY DON'T MAKE

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.330
SENSE.

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:36.731
SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN IN

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.299
EFFECT FOR OVER A DECADE.

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:39.567
WE NOW FOR MY TWO THOUSAND

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:40.768
EIGHTEEN FIELD POLL THAT ONLY

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:42.570
THIRTY PER 6% OF CALIFORNIA

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.272
VOTERS WHERE WHERE THE PROGRAM.

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.807
WHICH IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:48.176
DECREASE FROM 43% HOME WHERE THE

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.245
PROGRAM IN TWENTY ELEVEN IT'S

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:50.845
ACTUALLY WHERE NESS HAD WENT

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:53.414
DOWN -- IN

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.015
TWENTY FOURTEEN TO CALIFORNIA

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:54.949
WORKING FAMILY COALITION AND

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.284
SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:58.119
FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR EDT

01:25:58.186 --> 01:26:00.421
FROM DOCTOR OUTRAGE ON PFL.

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.625
WHICH WE HIRED --

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:04.259
EDT TALK A BIT ABOUT WHICH WAS

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.895
GREAT CAN ONLY PROVIDE

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.429
INFORMATION ON INCOME

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:10.164
REPLACEMENT IS A DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.466
FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING THAT

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:13.001
ENFORCES ARE JOB PROTECTION LAWS

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.235
AND THEREFORE CAN ONLY TALK

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.537
ABOUT JOB PROTECTION.

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:16.404
AND THERE'S SIMPLY NO

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.306
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH FOR

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:19.674
SOMEONE TO ACTUALLY EDUCATE ON

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:21.009
THE FULL.

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:23.111
SCOPE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO TAKE

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:23.845
RENTAL LEAVE [inaudible]

01:26:23.912 --> 01:26:28.049
AND IN ADDITION PEOPLE LACK

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:29.317
ACCESS BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE ARE

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:30.985
TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS ND NEED

01:26:31.052 --> 01:26:32.887
ASSISTANCE IS NOT CURRENTLY

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:33.421
AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:35.390
AGENCIES. TO THE BIGGEST BEARS

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.592
WE SEE IS THE PAPER APPLICATION

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:38.793
WHICH MOST LOW INCOME WORKERS

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.829
USE IS NOT EVEN IN SPANISH IT IS

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.364
ONLY AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH.

01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:46.801
AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.770
A HUGE BARRIER.

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:50.238
SO JUST SIMPLY PUT OUR FAMILY

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:51.839
MEDICALLY LAST NOT KEPT PACE

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.141
WITH THE OF ALL THE NEED TO

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:54.876
WORKING FAMILIES WHEN A NEW

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.377
TRIAL COMES IN THE HOME OR

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:57.979
FAMILY MEMBER IS ILL.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:59.781
ACCESS LEAVE AS BOTH PAID AND

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:02.016
JOB PROTECTED IS TRULY ESSENTIAL.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.351
WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LED THE WAY

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.452
AND FAMILY'S SUPPORT OF

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:06.521
WORKPLACE POLICIES THERE'S MORE

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:07.689
THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO?

01:27:07.755 --> 01:27:09.123
I'M SURE THAT WORKERS CAN TAKE

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.525
LEAVE WITHOUT RISKING THEIR JOBS

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:12.293
EDUCATE WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.028
ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS.

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:14.996
EXPAND FAMILY LEAVE RIGHT TO

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.965
TRULY MEET THE NEEDS OF WORKING

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.199
FAMILIES THANK YOU.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.301

01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:22.870

CAREY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:25.740
YOUR WORK ON THIS --

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:27.742
YOU ALSO TOUCH ON SOMETHING --

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.143
I THINK IS WORTH PUTTING A FINER

01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.279
POINT TO THAT NO WE DON'T HAVE

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:33.214
ACCESS TO THESE CHILD AT TO THE

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:33.514
YOU KNOW --

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:36.618
IT PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WE ALSO

DON'T HAVE AT AND EXACERBATES

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:40.755
THE GENDER PAY GAP.

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.490
SAID AS BIGGER SOCIETAL ISSUES

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:43.958
FOR US SO I THINK WE ALSO NEED

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:44.959
TO THINK ABOUT THE CONTEXT AT

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.594
HOME PORT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:47.562
THE WHOLE FAMILY --

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:49.263
BUT ONCE SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:50.598
YOU THE THE WORKERS THAT ARE

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:52.000
EXCLUDED FROM --

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.234
ACCESS -- TO

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:54.669

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:56.671
OF ESTIMATE HOW MANY WORKERS

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:58.906
USING THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:58.973 --> 01:27:59.774
EITHER JOB PROTECTION OF THE

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:00.475
PAID LEAVE.

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.409
THE FORTUNE --

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:03.678
WILL VIRTUALLY ALL EMPLOYEES PAY

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:05.513

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.048
EMPLOYEES --

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.183
BUT I YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I THINK

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.652
THE LAST IT IS LIKE I SAW IS

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:13.621
THAT LOW INCOME WORKERS MADE UP

01:28:13.688 --> 01:28:14.856
40% OF THE EMPLOYEES PAIN INTO

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:16.958
IT BUT ONLY 24% OF THE CLAIMANTS

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:19.527

AND THEN MISDIAGNOSIS.

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.067
CLOSE TO A QUICK FOLLOW AT TIMES

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:26.968
BECAUSE YOU CUT YOURSELF --

01:28:27.035 --> 01:28:28.569
BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.238
THAT OF COURSE NOT ALL.

01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:31.906
OF PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS ARE

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:35.343
INVOLVED IN OUR PAID LEAVE

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:36.644
PROGRAM IN SOUTH OF ACT ALL THAT

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.613
I JUST PRESENTED ON TEACHERS SO.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.981
WHEN A HIGHLIGHT THAT SOMEHOW

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:40.381
WE'VE --

01:28:40.448 --> 01:28:42.784
EXCLUDED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OUT OF

01:28:42.850 --> 01:28:45.019
THE PROGRAM AND AND THAT HAS A

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:47.488
SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT I THINK IT'S

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:47.855
YEAH ABSOLUTELY.

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:51.259
YEAH.

CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION --

COME IN HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.201
ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IT'S ONE

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:01.836
THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.471
HEARTS WE WERE PROUD TO SPONSOR

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:04.639
THE BILL THAT CREATED THE

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.607
PROGRAM BACK IN.

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:08.376
TWO THOUSAND TWO AND IT'S REALLY

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:11.379
BECOME ONE WHERE WE WHERE OF THE

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:11.946
PROGRAM IN THE COULD TAKE

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.081
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.749
THE BENEFITS ARE SO CLEAR AND

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:15.783
OBVIOUS THAT IT'S IT'S KIND OF

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:16.884
HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.886
LIKE BEFORE WE HAD THAT THAT.

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:20.621
IT USED TO REALLY BE JUST KIND

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:23.057
OF THE NORM THAT PARENTS.

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:24.192
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO TIME TO

01:29:24.258 --> 01:29:26.627
BOND WITH THEIR KIDS OR TIME.

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.129
TO CARE FOR A SICK LOVE ONE AND

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.230
THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.998
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:32.600
SUCH STRONG ADVANTAGE OF IT THAT.

01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:33.835
IT REALLY IS JUST PART OF OUR

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.470
CULTURE DIRECTOR HAVING TALKED A

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.137
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.171
DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:38.372
CHANGING CULTURE WELL THAT'S

01:29:38.439 --> 01:29:39.373
TRUE.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.608
WE DO THINK THAT THIS REALLY

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:43.144
STANDS OUT AS A SHINING EXAMPLE

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.279
PUBLIC POLICY THAT HAS DONE THAT

01:29:45.346 --> 01:29:46.581
THAT HAS CHANGED THE CULTURE AND

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:48.349
HAS PLAYED A VERY DECISIVE ROLE

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:49.083
IN.

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:50.184
NOT ONLY CHANGING INDIVIDUAL

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.120
WORKERS LIVES BUT ALSO CHANGING

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:54.522
THE WAY THAT WE AS A STATE LOOK

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:55.823
AT THE ISSUE OF BONDING WITH

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:56.824
THEIR CHILDREN AND TAKING CARE

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.126
OF LOVED ONES AND SO.

01:29:58.192 --> 01:30:00.027
WE'RE WERE HUGE SUPPORTERS OF

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.996
THE PROGRAM AND VERY MUCH WANT

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.998
TO PROTECT IT AND EXPAND --

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:05.566
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT SIX WEEKS

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:07.335
IS OFTEN NOT ENOUGH THE THE

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.403
SCIENCE IS CLEAR AND THOSE OF US

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.605
WITH CHILDREN KNOW HOW HARD IT

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.806
WAS YOU KNOW IT'S SIX WEEKS TO

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.307
IMAGINE JUST WALKING AWAY AND

01:30:13.374 --> 01:30:14.342
PUTTING IN A DAY CARE AT THAT IS

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.243
AT THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IS.

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:17.712
A VERY VERY HARD THING TO WRAP

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:20.848
YOUR HEAD SO --

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:22.049
IS SOMETHING THAT WE VERY MUCH

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.751
LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IN TERMS OF

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:26.120
EXPANDING AND THE THE LENGTH OF

01:30:26.187 --> 01:30:27.655
BENEFITS THE THE WAGE

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:28.956
REPLACEMENT WHATEVER WE DECIDE

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.525
MAKES THE MOST SENSE BUT IT IS

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.893
SOMETHING THAT WE SUPPORT.

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.494
AND WE HOPE THAT THIS RENEWED

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:35.696
FOCUS ON THE PROGRAM GIVES US A

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:37.765
CHANCE TO RESTORE WHAT WE THINK

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.267
IS A LONG OVERDUE CONVERSATION

01:30:39.333 --> 01:30:40.701
ABOUT FINANCING.

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.836
WHERE -- IT

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:42.870
WAS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.573
PANEL THAT WE ARE REALLY KIND OF

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.074
AN OUT LIAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.376
WAY THAT WE FINANCE OUR PROGRAM

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:51.913
IN THAT WORKERS PAY 41100% OF IT --

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.548
OF THE SEVEN STATES WELL SIX

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.049
STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:56.551
THAT DO HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.085
IT'S JUST CALIFORNIAN RHODE

01:30:58.152 --> 01:30:59.687
ISLAND THAT ASK FOR WORKERS TO

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:01.222
PAY FOR THE ENTIRE PROGRAM.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:03.157
AND I TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.792
THE IOWA WEBSITE TO FIGURE OUT

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:05.326
WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN OTHER

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:06.627
COUNTRIES --

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.496
AND IT'S A IT'S KIND OF HARD TO

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:09.564
MAKE SENSE OUT OF SOME OF THE

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:11.032
INFORMATION THAT'S ON THERE BUT

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:12.333
IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO FIND A

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.634
COUNTRY THAT.

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.102
DOES THE SAME THING THE

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.170
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:17.405
COUNTRIES EITHER HAVE EMPLOYERS

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.040
PAY FOR ALL OR SOME OF THE

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:19.707
PROGRAM.

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.943
AND SO WE REALLY DO KIND OF

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:24.278
STAND OUT AND THE FRUSTRATING

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.580
THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT THE

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:26.881
PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY THE BILL

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:28.816
THAT CREATED IT HAD SIX WEEKS

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:29.684
FOR WORKERS.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:30.918
AND IN SIX WEEKS FUNDED BY A SIX

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.420
WEEKS FUNDED BY WORKERS IN SIX

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.988
WEEKS FUNDED BY EMPLOYERS SO.

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:37.225
IT WAS A SHARED COST BETWEEN

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:39.260
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:40.828
BENEFITS EVERYONE DIRECTLY

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:44.765
BENEFIT WORKERS IN TERMS OF TIME

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:46.000
WITH THEIR LOVED ONES IT ALSO

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:51.205
BENEFITS NOT JUST EMPLOYERS BUT

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:52.073
SOCIETY AT LARGE IN TERMS OF ALL

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:52.740
ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THAT WERE

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:53.341
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AND SO.

01:31:53.407 --> 01:31:54.075
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:55.243
SEE.

01:31:55.309 --> 01:31:56.310
AS A PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BE A

01:31:56.377 --> 01:31:57.912
SHARED INVESTMENT BY BOTH

01:31:57.979 --> 01:31:59.480
WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THAT WE

01:31:59.547 --> 01:32:02.083
SHOULD ALL PRIORITIZE AND WERE

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:04.752
WE TO SET A PRECEDENT NOW WITH A

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:05.820
WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:06.954
ABOUT SOME SORT OF MAJOR

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.022
EXPANSION.

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.323
TO JUST GO BACK TO WORKERS AND

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:10.291
TALK ABOUT.

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.326
RAISING THE THE EXISTING TAXES

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:13.995
ON WORKERS WE THINK WOULD BE.

01:32:14.061 --> 01:32:15.997
FRANKLY PRETTY UNFAIR AND UNWISE

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:17.832
FOR A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS ONE

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.700
ISSUE IS THAT RIGHT NOW THE D.

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:21.302
I. FUND IS --

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.237
TO OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AS A

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:24.438
RESULT OF WHAT ARE CALLED

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:25.940
WORKERS COMPENSATION LEANS.

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:27.508
SO RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE WORKER

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.110
YOU GET HURT ON THE JOB I AND

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.278
YOU GO TO YOUR EMPLOYER IF THE

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:31.746
EMPLOYER BELIEVES THAT THE

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:32.914
INJURY ISN'T WORK RELATED.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.148
MOST OF THE TIME THOSE WORKERS

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:35.383
ARE FORCED TO GO INTO THE D. I.

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:37.184
FUND TO GET BY THEY DON'T GET

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:38.019
THE TEMPORARY DISABILITY

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:39.954
BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED

01:32:40.021 --> 01:32:40.421
TO ONE OF THE WORKERS

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:41.389
COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:42.523
AND SO THEN THE CLAIM GOES

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:43.591
THROUGH THE SYSTEM IS FOUND THAT

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:44.792
IT WAS WORK RELATED.

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.160
THE IDEA IS THAT THE STATE THEN

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.361
GOES BACK AND GETS THAT MONEY

01:32:47.428 --> 01:32:49.196
FROM EMPLOYERS INPUTS THAT BACK

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.865
INTO THE AYE FUND.UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T

01:32:50.932 --> 01:32:52.133
ALWAYS HAPPEN AND SO NOW THERE'S

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.634
AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT TWO

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:55.069
BILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT SHOULD

01:32:55.136 --> 01:32:56.237
BE IN THERE.

01:32:56.304 --> 01:32:58.839
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WORKERS

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:02.877
COMP FIFTEEN AND ALL INDICATIONS

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.045
ARE THAT THAT THE CLIENTS GOING

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:05.479
TO CONTINUE SO WE'VE GOT A

01:33:05.546 --> 01:33:06.714
SITUATION WHERE.

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.082
WORKERS COMP COSTS ARE GOING

01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:10.017
DOWN IN PART BECAUSE EMPLOYERS

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.152
AREN'T PAYING THE CLAIMS THAT

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.286
THEY'RE SUPPOSED.

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.487
TO AND WORKERS ARE HAVING TO

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:14.588
ESSENTIALLY MAKE UP THE

01:33:14.655 --> 01:33:15.456
DIFFERENCE OUT OF THEIR OWN

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:16.691
POCKETS AND SO.

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.059
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:19.293
THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.728
THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE WITH THE

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.263
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM

01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:23.197
WHERE --

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:24.131
WHEN THE WHEN THE RECESSION

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:25.733
STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.834
AND THE STATE HAD TO START

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:27.768
BORROWING MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:28.669
GOVERNMENT?

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.705
THE THE LOANS GENERATE MASSIVE

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.206
AMOUNTS OF INTEREST HUNDREDS AND

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:32.840
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:35.142
A YEAR THAT AT THE TIME THE

01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:36.177
GENERAL FUND DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.378
MONEY FOR THE GENERAL FUND WAS

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:38.479
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.314
AND SO THE MONEY WAS ESSENTIALLY

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:42.750
LOAN FROM THE D. I. FUNDS TO THE

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.385
U. I TRUST FUND TO COVER THAT

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.252
COST.

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:47.922
AND THE THE LOANS WERE NOT

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.524
ENTIRELY PAID BACK SO BY MY MATH

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.259
AT LEAST IT'S STILL OWED ABOUT

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:53.394
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.628
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:55.629
SECOND LOAN.

01:33:55.696 --> 01:33:57.765
AND THE THE DEEPER PROBLEM

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.233
THERE'S THERE'S A REAL

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.434
STRUCTURAL INSOLVENCY BUILT INTO

01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:01.502
THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:04.105
SYSTEM SO IN.

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.606
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE THE U. I

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.807
TRUST FUND ENDED THE YEAR.

01:34:06.874 --> 01:34:08.242
IN IN THE POSITIVE BALANCE FOR

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:09.744
THE FIRST TIME SINCE TWO

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:10.644
THOUSAND EIGHT SO IT'S

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:11.278
ESSENTIALLY BEEN BANKRUPT FOR A

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:11.912
DECADE.

01:34:11.979 --> 01:34:13.681
AND THE SECOND ANOTHER RECESSION

01:34:13.748 --> 01:34:15.282
STARTS IT'S A PRETTY SAFE BET

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:15.883
THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.385
HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE'RE GONNA

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:18.386
HAVE TO GO FIND SOME OTHER

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:19.720
SOURCE TO COVER THE INTEREST ON

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:22.156
THE FEDERAL LOANS AND THAT MAYBE

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.492
THE P. I. FUND SO.

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:27.061
HERE WE'VE GOT A SITUATION UNDER

01:34:27.128 --> 01:34:28.963
FUNDED STRUCTURALLY AS A MATTER

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.765
OF COURSE BY EMPLOYERS AND

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.333
WORKERS HAVE TO FUND THE

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:32.900
DIFFERENCE OUT OF THEIR OWN

01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:33.801
POCKET SO.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.536
IT'S IT IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR US

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:36.604
TO LOOK AT THESE TWO PROGRAMS

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.372
AND REALIZE THAT BECAUSE WE'VE

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:40.074
SET ASIDE THIS MONEY. TO TAKE

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:41.675
CARE OF OURSELVES WHEN TIMES ARE

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:44.645
TOUGH IT'S A THEN KIND OF USED.

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:45.880
TO BAIL OUT EMPLOYERS THAT DON'T

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:46.714
PAY LEGITIMATE WORKERS

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:48.115
COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND DEAL

01:34:48.182 --> 01:34:49.250
WITH THE STRUCTURAL INSOLVENCY

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:50.818
THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:51.052
SYSTEM.

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:53.954
SO IT'S WE BELIEVE UNFAIR TO

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.122
SOME DEGREE TO LOOK AT THAT

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:56.624
FUNDING LOOK AT US AS THE PLACE

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.525
TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.926
FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.261
FOR AN EXPANSION.

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:00.895
AND THIS IS ALL IN ADDITION TO

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:02.730
THE FACT THAT WORKER WAGES HAVE

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:04.231
ESSENTIALLY BEEN STAGNANT SINCE

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.399
THE MID SEVENTIES.

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:07.001
THAT UNLESS YOU'RE IN THE

01:35:07.068 --> 01:35:08.669
NINETIETH WAGE PERCENTILE OR

01:35:08.736 --> 01:35:10.504
ABOVE YOU REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN A

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:12.406
REYES AND FORTY OR FORTY FIVE

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:22.783
YEARS ON AVERAGE AND SO.

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.218
GOING TO THOSE WORKERS TO THAN

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:24.885
FROM THE INCREASE IN BENEFITS IS

01:35:24.952 --> 01:35:25.719
JUST ONE MORE BURDEN THAT MOST

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:26.821
OF US REALLY JUST CAN'T AFFORD --

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:27.488
AND ALSO GETTING INTO THE ISSUE

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.422
OF SOLVENCY CONCERNS THERE'S

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:28.956
BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:29.423
LOWERING THE SOLVENCY

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:30.691
REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUND TO HELP --

01:35:30.758 --> 01:35:31.525
THE FUND A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:33.027
THE EXPANSION MIGHT COST AGAIN

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:33.627
GIVEN THAT THE D. I. FUND IS

01:35:33.694 --> 01:35:35.830
ALREADY OWED TWO HUNDRED AND

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.131
THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:37.731
DOLLARS FROM THE TWENTY TWELVE

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:38.466
LOAN.

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:39.934
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO START

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.435
THINKING ABOUT WEAKENING THAT

01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.636
SOLVENCY BECAUSE IT WE

01:35:42.703 --> 01:35:43.504
ESSENTIALLY JUST KIND OF

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.206
PRETENDED THAT MONEY WAS THERE

01:35:45.272 --> 01:35:46.807
AS WE WERE LOANING THE MONEY OUT.

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.409
AND THEY GOT THEIR SESSION

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.177
DIDN'T GET MUCH WORSE BUT HAD

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:51.312
THAT HAPPENED.

01:35:51.378 --> 01:35:54.515
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHETHER OR

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:56.150
NOT THAT'S THE FUN TIMES SINCE

01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:59.019
IT WAS.

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:00.654
AND SO THOSE SONGS HE

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:02.823
REQUIREMENTS THERE IN LAW --

01:36:02.890 --> 01:36:04.125
WERE KIND OF CREATED THROUGH A

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:05.426
PAINFUL PROCESS OF TRIAL AND

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:06.393
ERROR IT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.562
THAT THAT WAS CREATED IT WAS US

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:09.997
REALIZING THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:11.298
ENOUGH MONEY IN THE FUND TO

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:12.633
COVER THESE BENEFITS AND SO WE

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.068
NEEDED TO KEEP MORE IN THERE.

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.903
AND SO WERE EXTREMELY CONCERNED

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.371
WITH ANYTHING THAT WOULD WEAKEN

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:18.873
THE SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS --

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:21.108
AS WAS MENTIONED THERE IS ALSO

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.109
CONCERN WITH THE FACT THAT SO

01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:23.444
MANY WORKERS DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:25.446
TO THE PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:27.281
CLEARLY IN THE LOG SOMETHING

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:28.516
THAT DOESN'T PROTECT THEM IF

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.050
THEY DO HAVE FEWER THAN TWENTY

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:31.085
CO WORKERS.

01:36:31.152 --> 01:36:32.019
AND THEY TRY TO TAKE THE LEAVE

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.654
AND AS WAS MENTIONED EMPLOYER

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:34.788
COMPLETELY FIRE THEM.

01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:36.123
THE SAD REALITY IS THAT EVEN IF

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:37.525
YOU ARE PROTECTED EVEN IF YOU DO

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:39.093
HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY CO WORKERS

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:39.994
THAT.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:40.961
THIS IS A LAW THAT STUFF TO

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.630
ENFORCE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:36:42.696 --> 01:36:43.998
WORKERS OUT THERE THAT ARE

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.099
SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED BUT

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.634
THEY'RE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.234
THAT IF THEY TAKE THIS LEAVE

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:49.703
THEY MAY NOT GET CALLED BACK THE

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:51.105
THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE FIRED FOR

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:51.539
SOME OTHER.

01:36:51.605 --> 01:36:52.806
REASON AND IT'S AN EXTREMELY

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.241
DIFFICULT THING TO PROVE THAT

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.976
AND SO IT'S GOOD THAT THE LAW IS

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:57.144
THERE BUT IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.279
SOLVE THE PROBLEM THERE ARE MANY

01:36:58.345 --> 01:36:59.813
THAT ON THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.814
BY THAT.

01:37:00.881 --> 01:37:02.116
AND ONE OTHER LAST ISSUE TO

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:08.222
RAISE IS THAT IF WE WERE TO

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:09.056
EXPAND THE PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:09.924
JUST RAISE THE WAGE REPLACEMENT

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.191
BENEFITS.

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:11.192
THAT MANY EMPLOYERS OUT THERE

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:12.226
COORDINATE BENEFITS SO THE

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.494
PROGRAM GIVES YOU YOUR 6270% OF

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.562
YOUR WAGES AND THEN THE EMPLOYER

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:16.263
WILL PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.164
3240%.

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:22.069
AND SO WERE WE TO FUND THE X.

01:37:22.136 --> 01:37:23.871
EMPLOYERS DO THAT THEN GET THE

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.306
ADDITIONAL MONEY AND BASICALLY

01:37:25.372 --> 01:37:26.307
TURN AROUND AND GIVE IT TO THEIR

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:28.175
EMPLOYERS SO IN A SENSE IT'S

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:30.477
RAISING TAXES ON WORKERS TO THEN.

01:37:30.544 --> 01:37:31.445
JUST TURN AROUND AND HANDED OVER

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:33.013
THE EMPLOYER AND SO THAT THAT'S

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.915
SOMETHING THAT WERE A LITTLE BIT

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.517
WORRIED ABOUT MAY CREATE SOME.

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:37.384
HEARTBURN AMONG THOSE WORKERS

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:39.286
THAT WOULD THEN SEE THAT PROCESS

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:40.588
HAPPEN --

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:41.855
BUT THOSE ARE JUST A GENERALLY

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:42.923
OUR MAIN PERSPECTIVES ON THE

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:44.291
SYSTEM AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.025
AGAIN.

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.327
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE VERY

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:48.629
VERY MUCH DO SUPPORT AND WOULD

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.797
LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED WE LOOK

01:37:49.863 --> 01:37:51.699
VERY MUCH FORWARD TO BEING

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.834
INVOLVED IN THE TASK FORCE.

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.468
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE EXPANSION

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:55.402
HAPPENS.

01:37:55.469 --> 01:37:56.637
IN IMAGE MADE MENTION OF THEM

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:58.105
AND AND MISS KERRY MADE MENTION

01:37:58.172 --> 01:37:59.740
OF THE KIND OF FEAR THAT WORKERS

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:04.211
HAVE. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OF OF

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.347
OF TAKING ANY FAMILY LEAVE --

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:10.551
BUT SHOULD BE XIN OF RETALIATION

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:13.087
AND MORE PRESUMING THAT YOU

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:14.221
AGREE THAT YOUR TELEVISION IS A

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:15.422
PROBLEM.

01:38:15.489 --> 01:38:16.657
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THERE

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:18.525
ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO?

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:19.093
TO ENSURE THAT WICKS WORKERS

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:20.761
TAKE FAMILY LEAVE WITHOUT FEAR

01:38:20.828 --> 01:38:22.763
OF ANY.

01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:24.632
ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION.

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:26.100
IS ANYTHING MORE THAT WE CAN DO

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:26.967
DO YOU THINK.

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.169
WELL IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM WITHOUT

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.004
IT'S A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.704
PROBLEM WITHOUT A

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.740
STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION WHERE

01:38:32.806 --> 01:38:34.241
IT REALLY JUST COMES DOWN TO

01:38:34.308 --> 01:38:36.410
ENFORCEMENT AND TYPICALLY.

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.911
THESE THINGS TAKE A VERY VERY

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:39.546
LONG TIME THAT'S PART OF THE

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:41.115
PROBLEM AND THAT'S A PRETTY.

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:43.350
PRETTY SIMPLE ONE TO DEAL WITH --

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:46.320
ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT STEP A

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:49.023
STRONG UNION AND IF THEY DO HAVE

01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:51.458
ACCESS TO A SPECIALLY --

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.526
JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS IN

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.361
THEIR CONTRACT THEN ONE THING

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:56.363
THEY CAN DO IS STAND UP FOR

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.264
THEIR RIGHTS AND EMPLOYER DOES

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:59.099
NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO FIRE THEM

01:38:59.166 --> 01:38:59.600
AND YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:00.934
ADDITIONAL LAYER OF ENFORCEMENT

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:01.869
THERE WHERE.

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:03.671
THE UNION CAN FILE A GRIEVANCE

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.339
UNDER THAT MAKE SURE WELL ARGUE

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:06.674
THAT JUST BECAUSE WASN'T NET AND

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:07.975
MAKE SURE THAT THE WORD GETS

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:09.310
THEIR JOB BACK TYPICALLY.

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:10.811
MUCH MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN THEY

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:13.013
DO ON OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT SO

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.548
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:15.883
ABOUT IT SOME OF IT PROBABLY

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.685
INVOLVES JUST A SIMPLE SOLUTION

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.553
LIKE GREATER FUNDING TO ENFORCE

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.355
EXISTING LAW --

01:39:21.422 --> 01:39:22.323
IN ADDITION ENCOURAGING MORE

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.390
WORKERS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.259
JOIN UNIONS BUT IT IS SOMETHING

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:26.193
THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET INTO

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:27.328
THE WEEDS OF IN THIS TASK FORCE

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.462
AND FIGURE OUT.

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:29.630
HOW WE CAN DO BETTER TO MAKE

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:31.432
SURE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:32.966
THAT WE HEAR ABOUT OVER AND OVER

01:39:33.033 --> 01:39:33.701
AND OVER AGAIN FROM A LOT OF

01:39:33.767 --> 01:39:34.635
WORKERS OUT THERE?

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:35.969
IN IN MISCARRY TO THAT POINT I

01:39:36.036 --> 01:39:37.604
MEAN DITION TO CLARIFYING

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:38.872
SIMPLIFYING THE RULES MAKE THEM

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:41.809
CONSISTENT. TO THE POINT OF I

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.477
THE REDUCE THE FEAR RETALIATION

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:45.412
ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING ACTUAL

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:46.313
RETALIATION.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:47.715
OF MOBILE WHAT ARE SOME THINGS

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:48.515
THAT YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.351
CAN DO YEAH --

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:53.120
I MEAN SO A LOT THAT I SEE ARE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:53.987
TWO THINGS ONE IS THE NOTICE

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:56.023
BOTH TO EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:58.125
ALL THE SURVEYS I'VE SEEN IS

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.860
EMPLOYEES ALWAYS REPORT THAT THE

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.295
NUMBER ONE PLACE TO HEAR FROM

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:02.463
ABOUT THE RIGHT IS FROM THEIR

01:40:02.529 --> 01:40:03.364
EMPLOYERS.

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:04.798
EMPLOYER SIMPLY AREN'T EDUCATED

01:40:04.865 --> 01:40:06.333
ON WHAT THESE ARE AND IT'S NOT

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:07.368
THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS DOING THE

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.535
WRONG THING OF COURSE I SEE THAT

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.437
HAVE ANY EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW THE

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:12.673
RIGHT THING BUT I'M.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.910
WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PAID

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.011
READILY VERNON'S WE DID A LOT

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:21.648
AND WE HAD WHEN FIVE HUNDRED AND

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:23.016
IN A WHERE WE ACTUALLY GOT ALL

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:26.053
THESE LAWS AND PROVIDE REAL

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:36.096
GUIDANCE AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN --

01:40:36.163 --> 01:40:36.730
THE ENFORCEMENT GOAL MUCH MORE

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:38.132
SMOOTHLY IN THE CITY BECAUSE OF

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:38.999
THAT -- AND

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:39.466
THEN WHICH I FOUND ITS

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:40.367
ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW THE

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:41.135
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.069
AND HOUSING WHICH ENFORCES THE

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.170
JOB PROTECTION AND THE ANTI

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:45.339
RETALIATION PROVISIONS --

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.306
IF YOU FILE WHAT THEY CALL PRE

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.341
COMPLAINING COREY HERE WAITING

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:48.208
AT LEAST THREE MONTHS FOR AN

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:49.643
INTAKE INTERVIEW TO FILE A

01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:51.612
COMPLAINT AND THEN IT'S A YEAR

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:52.679
FROM THE FILING OF THAT

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:53.881
COMPLAINTS.

01:40:53.947 --> 01:40:55.349
THAT YOU ANY DETERMINATION IS

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.084
USUALLY REACHED --

01:40:57.151 --> 01:40:58.786
NOW THAT I THINK IS A FUNDING

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:00.421
PROBLEM AND STAFFING AND HOW

01:41:00.487 --> 01:41:01.588
MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO DO IN

01:41:01.655 --> 01:41:04.224
TAKES BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE

01:41:04.291 --> 01:41:05.826
PROBLEM.

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:06.627
AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF THE MEAT

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:07.828
FIRST TURNED OVER TO MY

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.630
COLLEAGUES FOR I HAVE A COUPLE

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:10.864
OF THINGS --

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:11.932
IS BECAUSE ALSO.

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:13.534
SO MY QUESTION IS DO WITH INCOME

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.468
REPLACEMENT OF FIGURE --

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.236
SO I HEAR YOU AND AND SHARE YOUR

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:17.504
CONCERNS ABOUT --

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:19.706
SIMPLY REPLACING INCOME AT THE

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.141
BENEFIT OF AN EMPLOYER THAT NO

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:22.443
LONGER HAS TO REPLACE THAT

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:26.013
INCOME FOR HIGHER WAGE WORKERS

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:26.313
[inaudible]

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:29.316
BUT IS THERE A WAY --

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:34.188
TO INCOME REPLACEMENT BY --

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.422
BY SALARY E. R..

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.357
SO THAT WE COULD DO A 100%

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:39.026
REPLACEMENT MAYBE FOR MINIMUM

01:41:39.092 --> 01:41:40.861
WAGE WORKERS AND AND CHAIR IT

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:43.163
DOWN AS PEOPLE MAKE MORE SO IT'S

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.332
MORE OF A LIVING WAGE

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.267
REPLACEMENT.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:48.402
SURE I I CAN THINK OF ANY REASON

01:41:48.469 --> 01:41:49.136
WHY WE COULDN'T DO THAT OF

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:51.038
ESPECIALLY ANSWERING THAT WE DID

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:51.672
A VERSION OF THAT AND AB NINE

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.907
AWAY SO IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:55.242
TAKE A LOOK AT IT ALSO MIGHT BE

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:56.610
INTERESTING TO TRY TO FIND OUT

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:57.644
MORE ABOUT WHICH EMPLOYERS.

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.913
COORDINATE BENEFITS AS FAR AS I

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:00.547
KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.916
BEEN VERY THOROUGHLY STUDIED --

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:04.318
BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:06.553
MORE DATA ON WHOSE MOST AFFECTED

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.188
BY THAT THAN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:09.823
SUGGESTS WITH THAT IT WOULD BE

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:18.398
MUCH HIGHER INCOME WORKERS THAT.

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:19.199
THE INTENDED BENEFIT FROM THAT

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:19.933
KIND OF EMPLOYER POLICY BUT I

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:20.534
DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAFELY

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:21.168
SAY THAT'S THE CASE ACROSS THE

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:21.401
BOARD.

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:23.003
BUT LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT

01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:24.104
THAT EMPLOYER PROFILE LOOKS LIKE

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:24.771
THE ONES THAT TYPICALLY DO OFFER

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:26.507
COORDINATED BENEFITS WOULD BE

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:28.909
REALLY HELPFUL THING IN ADDITION.

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:29.676
TO OTHER MEASURES LIKE A

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:30.277
DISCUSSION AND I AGREE I MEAN

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:30.878
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH SUPPORT

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.446
FROM LARGE EMPLOYERS FOR OF

01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:34.681
WORKER PROTECTION AS INCOME FOR

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:36.884
EACH PLACEMENT WHICH SUGGESTS TO

01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:37.484
ME THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:39.753
GOING ON BUT I AM THAT.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:43.557
I AM TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:45.792
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO IF THIS IS

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.427
THE THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:48.595
CONCERNED ABOUT IT IS

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.230
SUBSIDIZING LARGE EMPLOYERS WHO

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.733
SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THEMSELVES --

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:55.135
IT IS I ATE MY OBSESSION WITH

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:56.403
ENSURING THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:57.571
ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.139
THAT PAYING MORE TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:00.440
TAKE THAT TIME OFF THERE ARE

01:43:00.507 --> 01:43:01.742
THERE ARE YOU PAID FOR IT. FOR A

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:03.277
LOT OF OTHER FOLKS TO BE TAKING

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.178
THAT TIME OFF SO --

01:43:05.245 --> 01:43:06.513
THEIR THEIR POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.615
BESIDES NOT ADDRESSING THAT THE

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:09.516
PERCENT OF THE INCOME

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.485
REPLACEMENT PERCENTAGE THAT WE

01:43:11.552 --> 01:43:14.454
COULD PROBABLY FIND YOU AGREE TO

01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:14.655
THAT.

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.590
ABSOLUTELY.

01:43:16.657 --> 01:43:17.791
A SIMILAR REVERSE SERGEANTS

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:19.927
WHERE.

01:43:19.993 --> 01:43:21.161
AND AND OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:23.463
MISSING GEHRY IN TERMS OF THE

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:25.265
EMPLOYER COMMUNITY AND SOMETIMES

01:43:25.332 --> 01:43:26.667
WE HEAR IS DISRUPTIVE FOR

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.735
DIFFICULT TO ACCOMMODATE.

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:30.270
OF THESE KINDS OF THESE BUT I I

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:32.606
BUT STUDIES SHOW THE OPPOSITE

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:34.942
THAT COST WAY MORE UP TO FIVE

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:36.376
TIMES MORE TO HIRE A NEW.

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:39.112
EMPLOYEE THAN TO ACTUALLY COMPLY

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:40.714
WITH THE LEAVE AND ANY THOUGHTS

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:43.517
ON THAT OR IS THAT CONSISTENT.

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.018
TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS YES

01:43:45.085 --> 01:43:46.219
THE CONSISTENT WITH ALL THIS

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:47.888
THEIR ABC SEEN SENSE FMLA WENT

01:43:47.955 --> 01:43:48.989
INTO A FACT YOU KNOW WHICH IS A

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:54.227
FEDERAL LAW PROVIDING FOR THE

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.430
TWELVE WEEKS UNPROTECTED.

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:57.798
JOB PREDICTED UNPAID LEAVE SORRY --

01:43:57.864 --> 01:43:59.099
AND ALSO THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE

01:43:59.166 --> 01:43:59.366
PROGRAM.

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:00.000
IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:01.034
REPORTED THAT IT'S HAD EITHER

01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:02.402
POSITIVE OR NO EFFECT ON

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:03.837
EMPLOYERS --

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:07.274
PROVIDING THIS LEAVE AMAZING AT

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:09.209
IMMEDIATE GUT REACTION THAT THIS

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.544
CAN'T BE DONE BUT WE SEE IT

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:12.946
HAPPENING ALL THE TIME AND YOU

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:14.748
KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO WE ALSO AS

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:15.849
PART OF MY WORK I HELPED LEAD

THE HEALTHY MOTHERS WORKPLACE

01:44:17.050 --> 01:44:17.851
COALITION.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.886
WHICH AWARDS EMPLOYERS --

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:20.487

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:29.296
MONTHS OF LEAVE AND THEY'RE

01:44:29.363 --> 01:44:31.264
GETTING IT DONE --

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:33.900
WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE WE WE

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:36.069
SUPPORTED AND YOU KNOW ALSO IN

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:37.904
CALIFORNIA WHICH I THINK MANY

01:44:37.971 --> 01:44:39.206
PEOPLE FORGET AS WE WE DO HAVE

01:44:39.272 --> 01:44:40.741
PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE LAW

01:44:40.807 --> 01:44:42.042
WHICH ACTUALLY APPLIES TO ALL

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.477
EMPLOYERS WITH AT LEAST FIVE

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:44.978
EMPLOYEES.

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:45.579
AND PROVIDE THAT AS LONG AS

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:51.652
WHILE YOU'RE CONSIDERED DISABLED

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:52.753

RELATED CONDITION THAT'S BEEN IN

01:44:54.388 --> 01:44:55.989
PLACE SINCE THE SEVENTIES AND

YOU KNOW WE HAVE A THRIVING

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.125
ECONOMY SELF.

01:44:58.191 --> 01:45:02.896
I THINK IT'S PLAYED HELP THAT

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:03.697
THIS KIND.

01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:05.032
IT IS A BENEFIT ACTUALLY TO

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.633
EMPLOYERS THANK YOU THE DOCTOR

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.701
CHAN'S --

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.369
YOU'D MENTION ONE THING ABOUT.

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:11.038
THE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT.

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:13.306
THE PAY THE BONTA PERCENT AND

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:15.575
AND TO THAT POINT MEAN WHETHER

01:45:15.642 --> 01:45:16.710
SIXTY OR SEVENTY WEATHER'S.

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:19.346
HUNDRED THAT I SIXTY OR 70% YOU

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:19.846
STILL HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:20.280
PRESSURE.

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:22.783
THAT LEADS TO OTHER.

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.751
KIND OF ISSUES TRAUMA OR JUST

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:25.952
CHALLENGES --

01:45:26.019 --> 01:45:26.953
WHY PEOPLE DON'T TAKE LEAVE IT

01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.723
ALL SO THE DIFFERENCE IS 63% AND

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:31.491
NOT TAKING LEAVE IT ALL WHICH IS

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.160
WHERE THEY KEEP UNDER PERCENT --

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:35.429
AND AND AND YOU MENTIONED THE

01:45:35.495 --> 01:45:37.197
POST PARTUM DEPRESSION.

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.565
AND WE HAD OF UNFORTUNATE CASE

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:40.867
RELATIVELY RECENTLY IN SAN JOSE

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:43.170
WHERE A MOTHER KILLED HER.

01:45:43.236 --> 01:45:44.805
THERE ARE TWO YOUNG BOYS INNER

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.606
SELF AND BUT WAS LINKED TO POST

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.575
PARTUM DEPRESSION AND SHE WAS

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:50.544
SHE WORKED EN EL SALON AND WAS

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.546
THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER.

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:58.852
AND I CAN OF ALWAYS.

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.721
THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

01:46:00.787 --> 01:46:02.456
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT ACTING WHEN

01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:04.224
IT COMES TO TAKING CARE OF THE

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:05.792
YOUNG PARENTS YOUNG MOTHERS.

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:07.094
TAKING CARE OF THESE CHILDREN

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:08.895
AND I JUST YOU KNOW WHAT THANK

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:10.263
YOU FOR BRINGING THAT IT JUST

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.532
KIND OF JOG MY MEMORY OF IT --

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:14.234
BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.169
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S ANECDOTAL BUT

01:46:16.236 --> 01:46:17.270
OBVIOUSLY THAT MAY NOT BE THE

01:46:17.337 --> 01:46:18.672
END RESULT YOU KNOW THE THE

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:19.973
TRAGEDY IN THAT CASE BUT IT DOES

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.174
CAUSE TRAUMA.

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.642
A IN SOME CASES WITH YOUNG

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:24.444
MOTHERS AND CAUSES TRAUMA BUT

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:25.312
THE CHILDREN OF THEY'RE NOT WITH

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:26.780
THEIR PARENTS --

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:28.115
WE SO MEAN AGAIN WE SEE AN

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:30.016
EXTREME EXTREME CASES OF THAT

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:31.651
WAS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER.

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.886
AS WELL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.187
SEPARATE A CHILD --

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.355
FORCING A PERIOD TIME BUT I

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:38.925
IMAGINE THAT ON A SMALLER LESS --

01:46:38.992 --> 01:46:40.927
SEVERE SCALE BUT THAT SEPARATION

01:46:40.994 --> 01:46:42.295
AT A VERY YOUNG AGE FOR LONG

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:46.566
PERIODS OF TIME LONG PERIODS OF

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:47.834
THE DAY.

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:48.668
I IMAGINE WOULD HAVE SOME LONG

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:49.269
LASTING IMPACTS IN TERMS THE

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:51.371
CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT.

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.806
YEAH I'VE I'D REALLY APPRECIATE

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:53.573
YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.509
SENTIMENTS AND THAT'S WHY I

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:57.377
HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE SO

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:59.246
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL --

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:02.015
THIS IS THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:03.416
WORKING CONDITIONS.

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:06.286
INCOME AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IN

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.789
THE MOST CRITICAL PERIOD OF LIFE

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.657
THERE'S NO OTHER POLICY THAT'S

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:12.425
LIKE THIS AND THERE'S NO

01:47:12.492 --> 01:47:14.094
INEQUITY THE UNITED STATES.

01:47:14.161 --> 01:47:15.896
THAT AS DISPARATE AS WHAT I SEE

01:47:15.962 --> 01:47:18.131
IN MY PEDIATRIC CLINIC RIGHT NOW

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:20.567
WE HAVE HIGH WAGE EARNERS WHO
