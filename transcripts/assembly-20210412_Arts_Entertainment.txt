GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS BILLS AB FIFTEEN. PROVIDES GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR TICKET BUYERS BY REQUIRING REFUNDS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS TO CANCELLATION OF AN EVENT AND I REQUIRE NOTICE BEFORE PURCHASE THE TICKET TO AN EVENT IS NON. TRANSFERABLE TO A THIRD PARTY. THAT COULD BE NINETY HAVE YOU EVER RESULTED IN A MASSIVE NUMBER OF ON. CANCELLATIONS LIVE EVENTS PLEASE CANCEL. MILITANT PROBLEMS FOR BOTH TICKET BUYERS AND TICKET SELLERS. TICKET SELLERS ATTEMPTED TO OFFER SUBSIDIES BERMAN SAYS THAT OF REPROCESSING RESPONSE TO CLOSURES. SOME COMPANIES ARE FACING A LOT OF STRAIN FROM THE AMOUNT OF REFUNDS. QUIETLY AMENDED THEIR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS RETROACTIVELY TO REMOVE THE REFUND GUARANTEES IN FAVOUR OF SUBSTITUTE PERFORMANCES. TICKET BUYERS THAT ARE ALSO FACING A LOT OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS BECAUSE OF COOPER NINETEEN AND MANY OF THEM PREFERRED TO RECEIVE A REFUND FOR THE SHOW THAT THEY WERE PROMISED THAT THEY COULDN'T GET INSTEAD OF A SUBSTITUTION. PARTICULARLY FOR SERVICES WHOSE POLICIES EXPLICITLY INCLUDED THE POSSIBILITY OF A REFUND WHEN THE TICKET WAS PURCHASED. YEAH THEY BOUGHT TICKETS IT SAID THAT WOULD BE REFUNDABLE IF THE IF THE EVENT WAS CANCELLED THE EVENT GOT CANCELED NO REFUND. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY STATES THAT A TICKET BUYER MAY REQUEST A REFUND WHEN AN EVENT IS CANCELED. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW DOES NOT STATE WHAT A CUSTOMER SHOULD RECEIVE THEIR MONEY BACK FROM THE TICKET SELLER. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL ENSURE THE TICKET BUYERS RECEIVE THEIR REFUNDS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF AN EVENT CANCELLATION WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A- PROCESS OF HAVING TO REQUEST ONE.THE BILL ALSO MAKES ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT TO THE LAW GOVERNING THE SALE TICKETS IT REQUIRES NOTIFICATION TO THE TICKET BUYER BEFORE SALE IF A TICKET IS NON TRANSFERABLE SO THE PEOPLE KNOW THEY CAN'T JUST GIVE IT TO A FRIEND. OR SELL IT. WHEN PURCHASING A TICKET A LOT OF BUYERS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT THEY PURCHASE IT THEY CAN'T JUST GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE OR SELL IT- AND THAT CAN LEAD TO HARDSHIP AND THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT BEFORE THEY PURCHASE A TICKET. NOT MONTHS LATER WHEN THEY FIND OUT THEY CAN'T AND THEY'RE BEING TURNED AWAY FROM THE EVENT- LIKE THE ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT ONE SHOW IN LOS ANGELES IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT MORE THAT HAPPENED TO MANY MANY PEOPLE. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIX IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS. WITH THIS BILL AND I WOULD APPRECIATE AN AYE VOTE TO THE WE CAN TAKE WORKING ON IT THANK YOU. THE BILL. GOT A MOTION. ON THE SECOND AN- BEEF WE OPEN UP THE OR FOR TESTIMONY DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE NY WITNESSES IN THE ROOM. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ANY ROOM IT SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE PHONES AT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SUPPORT FOR FIFTEEN FIFTY SIX ON THE PHONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SHOW SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE ZERO. AND THEN- TO THE MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY BODY ON THE PHONES THAT ARE THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE ONE THAT'S QUEUING UP FOR SUPPORT HERE JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE. THAT WILL COME FROM LINE THIRTEEN HIS GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN LINE THIRTEEN. AT THE END OF THE CHAIRED ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE ONLINE. YES. GO AHEAD MERICLE YES. HI THIS IS A GREGORY HOLLAND UNDER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF BROADWAY SAN FRANCISCO THE GOAL TO GET ENOUGH OF HIM SHE EVER AMBASSADOR THEATRE GROUP COMPANY FIRST I WANT TO THANK CHAIRPERSON TROUBLE FOR HAVING US TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND HER OFFICE. FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO ACCEPTING LANGUAGE RELATIVE TO SUBSCRIPTION ISSUE. I DO WHAT THAT WE BROUGHT TO THE MOBILE I DO WANT TO BRING UP AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE AND THAT IS REALLY THE TIMING OF THE REFUND TO A CONSUMER. PERSONS BECOMING TO INITIATE A REFUND FOR THE CONSUMER. AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THERE ARE FOUR STEPS TO REFUNDING MONEY ONCE AT AN EVENT HAS BEEN CANCELED. WE'VE THE TICKET SELLER INDUSTRY THE REEF. BUT THEN THE FUNDS BINGO FROM MOSCOW TO A MERCHANT SERVICE PROVIDER THANK ELEVONS WAR CHEST PAIN ATTACK WANTED THEY'VE APPROVED IT IT DOES TO YOU OFTEN A PAYMENT GATEWAY AND PAY PAL THE FROM PAYPAL FINALLY TO THE CONSUMERS BANK. AND THE CONSUMERS BANK TO FIGHT TO WIN THEY WILL ACTUALLY CREDIT THE CONSUMER'S ACCOUNTS SO WE PUT KLEINIAN LEGISLATION BASED ON THE TICKET SELLERS ACTIONS IT IGNORES THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN A FOUR STEP PROCESS. AND WE HAVE NO WE HAVE NO CAPABILITY OF DETERMINING THE TIME IT TAKES FOR FUNDS TO GET INTO A CONSUMER'S ACCOUNT. WHAT STRIKES ME WEDEMAN ANALYSIS OF THIS LEGISLATION HOWEVER IS THAT THERE IS A CONCERN AND I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE THAT THAT'S THAT TICKET SELLERS TICKET SELLERS LIKE CUTS WERE ABLE TO RETROACTIVELY. CHANGE THREE FROM POLICIES AFTER THE TICKET ALREADY PURCHASED TICKETS. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT AND I KNOW WE WANT TO DO THAT I WONDER IF WE CAN FIX THAT. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE TIGHTENING. OVER THE RECEIPT OF THE REFUND OR THE IMAGE. INITIATE OF A- WE MIGHT DO IN THE SELECT. WHERE DOES JUST RETURN WHYNOW FOR A COMPANY SUCH AS OURS THAT. AWAY FROM PER. AND TRUMP IT WILL EVERY TIME WE GET TO CHANGE. WE WILL NO LONGER. SHOWS WE WILL CHECK CANCEL FOLLOW THE FLEDGLING. EVERY TIME CANCEL CHERYL FAIR DISTORTIONS FROM ONE MONTH TO SIX MONTHS. IT COST JOBS AT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY UNION PERSONNEL SO THAT. THE MESSAGE BACK TO OUR UNION PARTNERS AN IRP STATE CHAMPS WARDROBE UNINSURED'S. BOX OFFICE. AND YOU SEE WILL. WHENEVER A SHOW TO CHANGED WILL CANCEL BUT SHALL AND WE CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE WILL BE REPLACEMENT WORK IN THE FUTURE AGAIN I WANT TO CLOSE BY THANKING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OF SERVING BROADWAY ACCESS COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH HER TO RESOLVE GLOBAL MAIN CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE ON THE LINE JUST TO STATE IF YOU ARE OPPOSED OR SUPPORT. AND AS A REMINDER TO ONE ZERO. WE DO HAVE ONE IN CUBA COMES FROM LINE FOURTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN- MY NAME IS MARK A PREY ITEM THE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF. A E. G. AND THEIR TICKETING SUBSIDIARY A ACCESS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY WE WANT TO THANK BOTH THE COMMITTEE. AND THE AUTHOR AND THEIR STAFF FOR- AMENDING THE BILLS SO THAT WE TREAT. CANCELLATIONS DIFFERENTLY FROM A RESCHEDULED OR POSTPONED EVENT- WE ALSO- I HAVE NOT GOTTEN COMPLETED THE- OUR ANALYSIS OF THE NON TRANSFERABLE NOTICE LANGUAGE- IN PARTICULAR- HOW THAT LANGUAGE OR HOW THE BILL- IS AFFECTED BY THE UNDERLYING STATUTE. THAT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO- WHILE WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE MEASURE AND HOW THE UNDERLYING STATUTE MAY APPLY WE- WOULD ASK THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO COME BACK. TO BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE'S DOWN DOWN THE PATH. TO RAISE ANY BJECTIONS THAT WE MIGHT SEE IN IN THAT APPLICATION AGAIN MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR- BEING. SO OPEN AND ENGAGING WITH US. THANK YOU. HI WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENT TO SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF IT I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ENGAGING WITH THAT SOME OF MY THEATER CONSTITUENTS AND SAN FRANCISCO AND- APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE- ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS TO. ADDRESS THE SUBSCRIPTION ISSUE AN UNNAMED DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE STILL ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AROUND- THE IDEA THAT- THAT A NUMBER OF THESE FOLKS- CAN INITIATE REFUNDS BUT CAN'T ENSURE THAT THE MERCHANT SERVICES ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEM WITHIN THE PERIOD OF TIME SO. MY HOPE IS THAT- BOTH SIDES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY RESOLVE THAT I KNOW ALSO THERE BEEN SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND HOW YOU SUBSTITUTE IDENTICAL SHOWS SO AGAIN MY HOPE IS. THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- WITH OUR OUR THEATER AND OTHER INDUSTRY CONSTITUENTS ON THIS AND WORK IT OUT BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND IF I CAN BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE- HAPPY TO DO SO. THANK YOU AND ANY OTHER COMMENTS. REMEMBER TO I IF YOU ARE I THINK THIS IS SELF OF THE CONSUMER ARE YOU APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT- ARE ARE YOU ACCEPTING TO- DOES SO- RECOMMENDATIONS AT THAT A YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY FOR- A HERE HERE THAT THE THIRTY DAYS SO MAYBE A LITTLE BIT TOO SHORT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT THE- LONGER AND THAT'S A ONE OFF COMMON SOURCE ALL I HEARD- AND- THE- SEPARATION OF A CANCELLATION WHO'S GONNA INITIATE. INITIATE THE MEANS THAT SOMEBODY HAS CHANGED THEIR MIND ON MYSELF I COULDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE OF A CANCELLATION YOU KNOW FROM OUR ARMED OF FROM DAY IT DEFENSE- A SPONSOR SO A THERE MAY BE MANY REASONS SO- WHY THE CANCELLATION MAY BE NECESSARY SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT THEY SHOULD BE- OAKS UP DOUBLE- THAT- D. APPLIANCE YOU. OR THE PROTECT THAT ESTARá SO THE INDUSTRY WILL HAVE A FULL FLEXIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THE I ENDED TO CLEAR. THE CAN HERE IS ONLY THE SHOW CANCELLATION NOT IF A CONSUMER CUNCIL'S THEIR TICKET WE'RE NOT THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT THIS IS ONLY IF THE THEATER CANCELS THE SHOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMER WHO BOUGHT THE TICKET IS NOT PENALIZED FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS NO FAULT OF THEIRS. SO AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS PART OF HOLLYWOOD- AND- CHUNK OF LOS ANGELES- I HAVE A VERY THEATER HEAVY DISTRICT MYSELF WITH A LOT OF THEATERS AND THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS CERTAINLY TO HURT OR PUT THESE THEATERS IN JEOPARDY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'VE BEEN SUFFERING SO MUCH THROUGH QUOTED. SO IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE AN AUTHOR WHO WANTS TO PROTECT THE TICKET GOERS BUT I ALSO WANT TO PROTECT THE THEATRES SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT DOESN'T- PENALIZE THE GOOD ACTORS OUT THERE THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL CANCELLATION WITH SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY HADN'T REALLY OCCURRED TO US THAT THAT WOULD BE A TRIGGERED BY THIS I IT WASN'T OUR INTENTION TO HAVE A- BEER COMPANY WHERE YOU PURCHASED YOUR TICKETS FOR THE WHOLE YEAR MAYBE THEY HAVE TO SWAP ONE SHOW OUT FOR THE OTHER. AND WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT- IS AFFECTED BY THIS SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE PARTIES- SO THAT IN THE ND I DON'T HAVE ANY ANGRY THEATER OPERATORS IN MY DISTRICT AND HOPEFULLY NO MORE VERY ANGRY CONSUMERS WHO END UP GETTING STUCK WITH A TICKET FOR A YEAR WITHOUT GETTING A REFUND. I HAVE A JUST A FOLLOW UP TO MORE QUESTIONS THE NUMBER. ONE USE THAT- I- UNDER THAT WOULD BE FUN POLICY WASHED THERE ARE THERE WAS MUCH OF A PROBLEM AND THAT THE- ARE YOU A BEER SPECIFIES A DATE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. SO THAT IS- KNOWLEDGE RESTRAINING AND THROUGH THE- EVENT. OF HOLDERS. YEAH AND THEN ALSO YOU WILL BE OR IT GOES INTO EFFECT THE FROM NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. CORRECT SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN- I DON'T KNOW WITH THE- CORPORATE NINETEEN. OH WAS SO DRAMATIC- EXPERIENCE OF THAT. STUFF OR SO MANY- EVENTS WERE CANCER THE- HOPE WELL WE NOT REPEAT SO I'M WHY THE THIS- THE- ALL THE CANCELLATIONS- THAT WERE MADE DUE TO. CORPORATE NINETEEN HAVE BEEN OR RESOLVE THE LAW ON RESULT IN THERE WITH THE- DISCUSSION SHOULD BE MADE TO RETROACTIVELY. RESIDENTS IN THE FUTURE NEXT YEAR ON- JUST HOPING THAT THIS KIND OF A MASSIVE A- CANCELLATION WOULD NOT HAPPEN SO YOU'LL BE IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE. IF YOU TRY TO- ATTACKED CONSUMERS OF WHAT VICTIMIZED AND THE- INTENSELY. REFUNDS ONE ON MADE YEAH WELL THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT IN THE FOUGHT AYE I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST WE CAN DO IS HOPE THAT. AS THE BILL PASSES AND HOPEFULLY WILL PASS THAT THE BIGGER COMPANIES WILL START TO ISSUE THE REFUNDS THAT RE IN ARREARS AND THAT AT LEAST PEOPLE WILL FEEL GOOD KNOWING THAT COME JANUARY FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR. BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR SOME OF THEM AND IN TERMS OF WHETHER THIS IS STILL A PROBLEM WE'VE GONE TO WE HAVE A AN INTERN IN OUR OFFICE WHO BASICALLY HAS GONE THROUGH THE WEBSITES IN THE PAGES OF A LOT OF THE TICKET SELLERS AND THIS IS A HUGE SOURCE OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS TO GET REFUNDS AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN REFUNDS FOR SHOWS SO- THIS SEEMS TO BE A BIG PROBLEM I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IT WAS PRE CODED BUT THERE WAS STILL SOME ISSUE. AND THERE STILL HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WITH CANCELLATIONS FOR ALL MANNERS OF THINGS- SO- I DO HOPE THAT IT SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE TICKET SELLERS THAT YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO GET THEIR PROCESSES TOGETHER TO START GETTING- TICKETS OUT AND I AGREE WITH YOU I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE HAVE LESS CANCELLATIONS AND THAT OUR- THEATERS CAN GO BACK AND HOPEFULLY THRIVE. PEOPLE WANT TO GET OUT OF THEIR HOUSE AND GET SOME ENTERTAINMENT. YEAH I JUST HOPE THAT THE NORMAL OF CONVENE NINETEEN KIND OF US LAST YEAR'S KIND OF EXPERIENCE TO WOULD BE AN OLD REPEATED UP BUT IF AND WHEN. WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE MASSIVE CANCELLATION DUE TO SHUTDOWN OF EVERYTHING SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST A REASON- THE REFUND TO BE MADE THAT THE MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF- OF CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REASON- I THINK IF CONCERNED THIRTY DAYS SO MAY BE TOO SHORT OF TIME FOR THEM TO PROCESS THAT AMOUNT OF- IN A TICKET. THE REFERENCE. TO BE MADE TO SO IF YOU CAN PLEASE ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS. AND THE IMPACT SIDE I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FEASIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU- I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE MADE A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE MADE- YOU'VE AGREED TO KEEP WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND ASSIGN HAPPY TO. MOVE THIS BILL ALONG. ALL RIGHT AND THEN- VICE CHAIR FOLDER S. MOST OF MY KIND OF MOST OF MY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED- I WOULD JUST SAY- JUST ASK RATHER YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE RECURRING IS THAT THIS IS A MULTI STEP PROCESS- CAN YOU JUST EXPRESSWAYS WAS A SET TIME VERSES IN FORTY FIVE DAYS ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. AND THEN I WILL I'LL JUST MENTION THAT I AM REALLY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE SHEL SHEER VOLUME OF CANCELLATIONS THAT HAD TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF COALBED I'M REALLY ARE IS WHY WERE IN THIS SITUATION I APPLAUD YOU FOR PROTECTING CONSUMERS IT IS VITAL WHEN YOU KNOW EVERY HOUSEHOLD IS LOOKING FOR MORE MONEY AT THIS TIME- IT IS VITAL OF THEIR- TICKET AND HAS HAS BEEN CANCELED THAT THEY GET THAT BACK INTO THEIR BANK ACCOUNT BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY WE WOULDN'T MOVE FROM FORTY FIVE DAYS VERSUS. THEIR DIRECT WHAT WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FEASIBLE WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS JUST TO HAVE LANGUAGE THAT'S VERY OPEN ENDED LIKE INITIATE FOR INSTANCE AND THEN HAVE THE SAME BAD ACTORS SAY BUT WE INITIATED IT IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS BUT IT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM ANYMORE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS SOME SENSE THAT YOU HAVE A CERTAIN THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE TAKEN SOMEONE'S MONEY. AND NOW IT'S UP TO YOU TO GET THE MONEY BACK TO THEM YOU CAN'T JUST WASH YOUR HANDS OF IT WALK AWAY AND SAY THAT IT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM BUT WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO SAY WHAT WE KNOW HOW REALLY CAN WE MAKE THIS WORK HOW LONG THIS IS REALLY TAKE- AND I AGREE THAT- BUT IT'S CERTAINLY EXACERBATED THIS BUT THESE WERE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE COMING IN BEFORE COLLUDED TO. YOU KNOW A ROCK CONCERT GETS CANCELED BECAUSE THE LEAD SINGER. LOSES THEIR VOICE. AT THE SOMETIMES THESE HAVE THESE BEEN PROP. IN THE- AS WELL. SO BUT ABSOLUTELY. I HAVE A LOT OF THEATERS IN MY DISTRICT AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM UPSET AT ME EITHER. AND I ALSO DON'T WANT TO HURT THEM. I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED SO I THINK THAT WE WILL FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROTECTIONS BUT WE DO SOMETHING THAT'S- EVERYONE SAYS OH YEAH WE CAN DO THAT. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU.
