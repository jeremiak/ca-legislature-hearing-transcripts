00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.680

THE HOUSE MANAGER DIDN'T EVEN

WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT OVERLOOKS

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.506
THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.609

WELL I'M NO EXPERT I KNOW WE CAN

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:10.213

WE DIDN'T ALWAYS DO THIS HOWEVER

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.662
THIS PRACTICE WAS STARTED IN THE

VULNERABLE TO MAKE POOR

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:29.853
DECISIONS.

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.421

NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.331
THEIR ACTIONS BUT THEY'RE ALSO

00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:17.634
REQUIRE AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.569

A JUVENILE TOOK CRIMINAL COURT

FAILED AND A FITNESS HEARING IN

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.530
JUVENILE COURT BECOMES NECESSARY

THE DISCRETION TO DECIDE --

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:40.168

TRANSFER THE MINOR TO CRIMINAL

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:43.672
COURT IT WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.073
JUVENILE COURT JUDGE AND IT

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.341

HE KNEW SHE'D LIVED ALONE AND

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.085
THAT'S WHY HE TARGETED HER.

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:32.520
WE ALSO HANDLED THE CASE OF A

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:34.456

FIFTEEN YEAR OLD MINOR WHO WAS

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.153

RIVAL GANG MEMBER.

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.105
INDIA'S RARE SITUATIONS WHERE

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.606
THE JUVENILE COURT MAY THINK IT

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.308
IS APPROPRIATE TO TRANSFER THIS

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.876
CASE TO CRIMINAL COURT.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.311
THE JUVENILE COURT WOULD NOT BE

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:04.946
ABLE TO DO SO IF THEY'RE NOT

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.114
ABLE TO PASS A FITNESS HEARINGS

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.615
IN THEIR COURT THEY WOULD NOT

HAVE THAT DISCRETION EVEN IF

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.719
THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS MINOR

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:12.854

THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE THE

JUVENILE COURT WE BELIEVE IS IN

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.526
THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW WHO IS

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.527

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.063
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.131
AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.766
THAT THE JUVENILE COURT DOES

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.501
HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THESE

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.803

THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD

01:48:33.473 --> 01:48:35.508

DO NOT SPECIFY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:40.347

01:48:45.352 --> 01:48:46.653
AFTER.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:47.821
HAVE -- DID

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:52.325
THE USUAL SOME IT'S BEEN TWENTY

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:54.861
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER --

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:57.564
PER VICTIM SO THAT IS THE AMOUNT

01:48:57.631 --> 01:48:59.299
WE'RE THINKING WOULD BE PER HOUR

01:48:59.366 --> 01:49:01.001
IT WOULD BE --

01:49:01.067 --> 01:49:03.336
APPROPRIATE AND IT THAT AMOUNT

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:05.572
IF THERE WERE FOR EXAMPLE A

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:06.806
HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT CLAIMS

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:08.541
THE TOTAL COST FOR COMPENSATION

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:10.010
BE SLIGHTLY LESS THAN FOUR

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:12.078
MILLION WHILE OUR ESTIMATE IS

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.114
THAT THERE'S BETWEEN SIX AND

01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.548
SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE.

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:18.084
WHO WERE ALIVE TODAY THAT?

01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:20.487
GROUP BIG EXPERIENCE THIS --

01:49:20.553 --> 01:49:24.724
STERILIZATION AND IT WOULD BE

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:29.462
VERY DIFFICULT. TO TO IF THE

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:32.132
BILL SUCCEEDS GIVEN THE ADVANCED

01:49:32.198 --> 01:49:33.600
STAGE OF MOST OF THEM.

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.535
WHILE EUGENICS STERILIZATIONS

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.304
DID CONTINUE INTO SIXTIES AND

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:38.738
SUCH.

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:41.041
THE THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:42.275
MUCH FROM THE MORE IN THE

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:43.610
THIRTIES AND FORTIES.

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:45.745
SO GIVEN THE ADVANCED AGE AND

01:49:45.812 --> 01:49:49.182
THE WE DID NOT PUT.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:52.352
AND OVER AMOUNT OF ONUS ON IT

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:54.120
WOULD BE MORE APT TO ADVOCACY

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:56.189
GROUPS -- TO

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.624
TO TRIED IT TO ASSIST THE

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:59.025
VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD SO

01:49:59.092 --> 01:50:00.293
THAT'S WHY WE ESTIMATE THAT

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.362
WOULD BE A RELATIVELY LOW NUMBER

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.030
THAT DID COME FORWARD.

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:06.166
SO OUR COST ESTIMATE IS BETWEEN

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.101
FOUR AND FIVE MILLION

FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DOES.

01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:59.946
IS ADDRESSED THE FACT THAT

CALIFORNIA'S MURDER STATUTE.

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:06.886
HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED. FOR

01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:10.657
DECADES AND WHEN IT WAS ADOPTED.

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:12.492
IT SWEPT UP.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:15.061
THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW CONCEPT

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:18.631
OF FELONY MURDER WHICH IS.

01:52:18.698 --> 01:52:20.767
AS I INDICATED IN A A COMMON LAW

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:22.235
CONCEPT THAT IS MORE THAN A

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:23.436
CENTURY OLD.

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:27.107
WHICH BASICALLY --

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:29.776
IT IS NOT SO MUCH.

01:52:29.843 --> 01:52:31.077
HOLDS.

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:36.082
A BE A CULPABILITY.

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:39.419
IS OF A OF THE PERSON THAT

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:42.155
QUESTION IS LESS A FACTOR.

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:45.391
IN THE CHARGE FOR THE CRIME AND

01:52:45.458 --> 01:52:47.760
INSTEAD WHAT IT IS ANYTIME A

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:49.262
CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED WHERE

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.697
DEATH OCCURS.

01:52:50.763 --> 01:52:52.799
THE FELONY MURDER RULE SWEEPS

01:52:52.866 --> 01:52:53.800
ACT.

01:52:53.867 --> 01:52:55.902
THAT THE ANY PARTICIPANT IN THAT

01:52:55.969 --> 01:52:57.504
CRIME.

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.672
NOW WHAT THAT IN ITS PRACTICAL

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:01.875
EFFECT HAS RESULTED IN IS THAT

01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:04.177
WE HAVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO

01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.246
ARE SERVING LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE

01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:08.114

THE MURDER.

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:17.590
AND WHILE WE STILL HAVE ON THE

01:53:17.657 --> 01:53:21.628
BOOKS SUCH LAWS AS ACCESSORY TO

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:23.463
MURDER AN ACCOMPLICE TO MURDER

01:53:23.530 --> 01:53:25.098
WE HAVE THE ABILITY THROUGH

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:28.535
EXISTING STATUTES. TO CAPTURE

01:53:28.601 --> 01:53:31.004
THOSE A WHAT WE MIGHT CALL

PARTICIPANTS IN A CRIME.

01:53:33.206 --> 01:53:34.507
AND DEAL WITH THEIR LESS

01:53:34.574 --> 01:53:38.311

TO A APPLY FILL ANY MURDER RULE

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:43.516
TO THOSE WHO HAD A VERY MINIMAL

IF ALMOST A NONEXISTENT ROLE IN

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:48.755
THE CRIME --

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.223
SO -- THAT

01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:52.659
IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TEMPTED TO

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.461

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:57.330
AND NARROW IT IN A WAY THAT

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:30.156
NONE OF THAT MATTERS.

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.924

02:17:37.949 --> 02:17:39.484
WILL DESCRIBE THE AMENDMENTS WE

02:17:39.551 --> 02:17:40.719
HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:41.620
CONCERNS BUT I WANNA PREFACE IT

02:17:41.686 --> 02:17:43.555

02:17:43.622 --> 02:17:46.091
THAT WHILE.

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:47.492
REGARDLESS OF HOW WE AMEND THIS

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:49.527
BILL.

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:52.197
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THERE ARE.

02:17:52.263 --> 02:17:54.399
PEOPLE WHO.

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.301
HAD THE SAME ROLE.

02:17:56.368 --> 02:17:57.669
IN THE COMMISSION OF A FELONY

02:17:57.736 --> 02:17:59.004
WERE A DEATH OCCURRED WHO ARE

02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.538
NOT SENTENCED UNDER FELONY

02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:04.542
MURDER.

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:05.176

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:06.378
ARE.

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:08.913
SO WE HAVE ALREADY IN EXTREMELY

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:10.715
UNEQUAL CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE

02:18:10.782 --> 02:18:14.419
LIVE LAW WAS NOT APPLIED TO ALL.

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:16.855
SO IN OTHER WORDS EVERYONE.

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:19.024
WHO IF WE IF WE HAD OUR WITNESS

02:18:19.090 --> 02:18:20.625
AT THE TABLE WHO DESCRIBES HIS

02:18:20.692 --> 02:18:22.560
SON CIRCUMSTANCE?

02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:24.763
WE COULD EVERY SIMILAR PERSON.

02:18:24.829 --> 02:18:26.431
WHO DID NOT GET CHARGED THAT WAY

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:29.501
AS HIS SON DID?

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:30.635
AND WE HAVE --

02:18:30.702 --> 02:18:31.936
THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DATA TO

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:35.106
THAT EFFECT --

02:18:35.173 --> 02:18:37.308
SO OF COURSE IN WHAT

02:18:37.375 --> 02:18:40.845
UNFORTUNATELY OCCUR SO OFTEN.

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:43.248
IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS YOUR IN

02:18:43.314 --> 02:18:45.517
ADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION.

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:46.785
BECAUSE EITHER DUE TO POVERTY OR

02:18:46.851 --> 02:18:48.553
OTHER REASONS.

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:50.655
AND THEN YOU MIGHT DO A PLEA

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:51.656
BARGAIN.

02:18:51.723 --> 02:18:52.924
IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ANOTHER

02:18:52.991 --> 02:18:54.059
PERSON WITH BETTER

02:18:54.125 --> 02:18:56.061
REPRESENTATION DID NOT AND YET

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:58.163
YOUR ROLE IN THE PARTICULAR

02:18:58.229 --> 02:18:59.664
CRIME WAS EQUAL.

02:18:59.731 --> 02:19:01.066
SO I JUST WANTED TO FIRST PUT

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:03.101
THAT IN THE RECORD NOW WE HAVE

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:04.769

PLANNED THE MURDER IF YOU --

02:19:50.115 --> 02:19:51.716
PAID SOMEONE FOR THAT MURDER IF

02:19:51.783 --> 02:19:53.985
IT DIDN'T VARIETY OF OTHER VERY

02:19:54.052 --> 02:19:56.654
SPECIFIC ROLES IN IT THAT ART

02:19:56.721 --> 02:19:58.289
CHEST THE ACTUAL MURDERER.

02:19:58.356 --> 02:20:00.325
YOU WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM THIS

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:02.460

02:20:05.396 --> 02:20:07.332

02:20:44.135 --> 02:20:45.703
REASONABLE DOUBT.

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:49.641
SO WE ARE STILL IN CONVERSATION.

02:20:49.707 --> 02:20:51.476
TO SEE WHAT MIGHT A ADDITIONALLY

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:55.613
ADDRESS CONCERNS BUT I THINK THE

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:58.483
DA'S OF REP WOULD DESCRIBE THAT

02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:59.384

INTENTIONAL.

02:21:28.146 --> 02:21:29.647
WITH IRAQ TALK ABOUT BEING TOUGH

02:21:29.714 --> 02:21:31.716
ON CRIME ARE SOFT ON CRIME YOU

02:21:31.783 --> 02:21:32.584
COULD SAY THIS IS ABOUT BEING

02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:33.852
INTENTIONAL.

02:21:33.918 --> 02:21:37.655
RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS ALIGNING.

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:40.625
THE CHARGE AND THE SENTENCE WITH

THREE STRIKES LAW.

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:03.615
IN THE BILL.

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.750
YOU WOULD JUST HAVE THE ABILITY

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:08.586
TO BE RE SENTENCED FOR YOUR ROLE

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:10.321

YOU.

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:17.962
OKAY MCKINNEY ANY OF KILEY.

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:18.563
A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:19.831
THE AND WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:21.032
THAT DETERRENCE VALUE OF THE

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:22.901
FELONY MURDER RULE EITHER ITS

02:22:22.967 --> 02:22:24.202
CURRENT VERSION OR WHATEVER

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:25.169
REFORM VERSION YOU'D BE.

02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:30.275
COMFORTABLE WITH.

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:32.010
WE THINK THE VALUE OF WHAT IS

02:22:32.076 --> 02:22:33.678
THE VALUE HAVING ANY FELONY

02:22:33.745 --> 02:22:34.846
MURDER.

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.547
RULE ON THE BOOKS PLATED

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.216
DETERRENCE VALUE IS THAT PEOPLE

02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:39.617
ARE DISSUADED FROM PARTICIPATING

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:42.020
AND SERIOUS [inaudible]

02:22:42.086 --> 02:22:44.055
DANGERUS FELONIES.

02:22:44.122 --> 02:22:45.857
BECAUSE IF SOMEONE.

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.058
DIES IN THE COMMISSION OF THAT

02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:50.028
FELONY AS THE LAW IS TODAY.

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:52.196
ANYBODY INVOLVED IN THAT.

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:54.999
COULD CONCEIVABLY --

02:22:55.066 --> 02:23:00.071
RECEIVE FIRSTLY MURDER CHARGE.

02:23:00.138 --> 02:23:03.841
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR QUIRK --

02:23:03.908 --> 02:23:05.777
THIS ISABEL THAT'S A LONG TIME

02:23:05.843 --> 02:23:08.479
COMING AND IT'S VERY FAIR.

02:23:08.546 --> 02:23:10.181
ARE WE ACTUALLY HAVE CASES WHERE

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.816
THE SHOOTER IS OUT ON THE STREET

02:23:11.883 --> 02:23:15.119
BECAUSE HE OUR WAS WILLING --

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:16.821
TO GIVE EVIDENCE.

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:19.357
WHEREAS THE PERSON IN THE CAR

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:20.992
WHO HAD NO IDEA THAT --

02:23:21.059 --> 02:23:22.060
MURDER WAS BEING COMMITTED IS

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:24.629
STILL IN JAIL --

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:26.297
I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:27.765
WHICH RESTORES FAIRNESS TO OUR

02:23:27.832 --> 02:23:31.836
SYSTEM THANK YOU.

02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:36.441
BUT MISS COME LABOR DOVE.

02:23:36.507 --> 02:23:38.443
TARRANT THAT IT --

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:40.244
YOU PEOPLE THINK TWICE.

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:42.647
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING.

02:23:42.714 --> 02:23:44.816
IF ANYONE AT THE DAY AT THE

02:23:44.882 --> 02:23:46.384
TABLE CAN SHARE YOU KNOW IF

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:48.119
YOU'VE HEARD OF CRIMINALS WHO

02:23:48.186 --> 02:23:48.920
HAVE SAID.

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:51.055
YOU KNOW.

02:23:51.122 --> 02:23:51.956
I WAS GONNA DO THIS BUT THEN I

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:54.826
THOUGHT I IS GOING TO BE A SIX

02:23:54.892 --> 02:23:55.660
EIGHTY SEVEN ALL THIS IS GOING

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:57.028
TO BE A ONE EIGHTY SEVEN I MEAN

02:23:57.095 --> 02:24:00.164
HAVE I HAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE

02:24:00.231 --> 02:24:00.865
SAID THIS BEFORE MY HUSBAND AS A

02:24:00.932 --> 02:24:02.567
DEFENSE ATTORNEY IN.

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:06.571
IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY IN RARE.

02:24:06.637 --> 02:24:08.206
THAT IN HEARING STORIES PEOPLE

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:10.041
ARE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE

02:24:10.108 --> 02:24:12.443
PENAL CODE THAT COULD BE APPLIED

02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:13.611
TO THEM IF THEY'RE DOING AN ACT

02:24:13.678 --> 02:24:15.279
SO BUT MAYBE I DON'T HAVE

02:24:15.346 --> 02:24:17.815
ACCURATE INFORMATION.

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:19.817
CAN YOU SHARE IF THAT HAPPENS I

02:24:19.884 --> 02:24:22.153
GILLOOLY WELL I CAN GIVE YOU ONE

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:24.022
FIRST HAND EXAMPLE.

02:24:24.088 --> 02:24:26.657
SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THIS BUT TO

02:24:26.724 --> 02:24:28.059
MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY WERE

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:29.427
MURDERED IN WHAT IS STILL TODAY

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:30.995
THE WORST MASS MURDER.

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:31.829
IN THE HISTORY OF THE CITY OF

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:34.032
LOS ANGELES LITTLE BAR ON

02:24:34.098 --> 02:24:35.700
NORMANDY JUST SOUTH OF SLAWSON

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:37.335
WAS FIRE BOMBED --

02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:39.103
THE GUY WHO DROVE THE GETAWAY

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:42.073
CAR MANUEL HERNANDEZ --

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:45.143
AT THE TRIAL LOW IN HIS DEFENSE

02:24:45.209 --> 02:24:47.278
LAWYER ARGUED AT THE TRIAL --

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:49.080
THAT -- GEE

02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:50.948
ALL HE DID WAS BUY THE BUCKET A

02:24:51.015 --> 02:24:52.850
GASOLINE THAT WAS THROWN INTO

02:24:52.917 --> 02:24:53.684
THE BAR TO BURN SIX PEOPLE TO

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:54.919
DEATH -- BUT

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:57.221
HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE

02:24:57.288 --> 02:24:58.856
INTENT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE THEY

02:24:58.923 --> 02:25:00.224
WERE JUST TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE.

02:25:00.291 --> 02:25:02.060
AND HAD HE KNOWN HE WOULD HAVE

02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:03.761
BEEN LIABLE HE WOULDN'T OF BEEN

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:05.329
INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL HE MADE

02:25:05.396 --> 02:25:06.764
THAT SAME ARGUMENT WHEN HE WAS

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:08.733
ULTIMATELY PAROLED --

02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:10.068
AND THAT WAS --

02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:13.204
THAT THAT WAS A CONSTANT --

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:15.039
REFRAIN --

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:16.607
FROM HIM --

02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:17.208
BUT NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:20.845
THAT INCLUDING GILBERT COULD

02:25:20.912 --> 02:25:22.647
SALAS AND JOSE MY DOOR AND I IN

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:25.249
OUR FAMILY WERE MURDERED.

02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:27.085
JUST TO CLARIFY THIS BILL WOULD

02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.553
NOT HAVE --

02:25:28.619 --> 02:25:31.122
WOULD NOT ALLOW RE SENTENCING

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:34.559
FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT

02:25:34.625 --> 02:25:37.895
DOES NOT AND GIVE ANY RELIEF TO

02:25:37.962 --> 02:25:39.564
THOSE WHO AIDED AND ABETTED.

02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:41.332
THE KILLING WHICH OCCURRED IN

02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:43.067
THIS CASE SO.

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:45.436
IT'S NOT BE APPROPRIATE AS I AM

02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:48.272
SURE THERE ARE --

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:50.575
EXAMPLES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.844
THAT WOULD --

02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:55.146
MAKE US SOME OF US UNCOMFORTABLE

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:57.248
BUT THAT ONE DOES NOT FIT FOR

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:59.550
THIS PARTICULAR BILL --

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:01.385
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO SPEAK TO

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:02.186
THE DETERRENCE IF I MAY.

02:26:02.253 --> 02:26:06.124
CHAIR --

02:26:06.190 --> 02:26:08.159
REGARDING THE DETERRENCE ISSUE.

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:10.094
RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FEWER

02:26:10.161 --> 02:26:12.530
THAN HALF A PERCENT.

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:15.299
OF INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED FOR

02:26:15.366 --> 02:26:16.934
FIRST OR SECOND DEGREE MURDER.

02:26:17.001 --> 02:26:20.004
WERE EVEN AWARE THAT THE FELONY

02:26:20.071 --> 02:26:22.607
MURDER RULE AS SUPPLIED EXISTED

02:26:22.673 --> 02:26:23.174
BEFORE THEY COMMITTED THEIR

02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:24.442
CRIMES.

02:26:24.509 --> 02:26:26.444
SO IF ONE IS NOT AWARE OF SUCH A

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:28.379
RULE.

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:31.015
AND ITS EXTREME CONSEQUENCES.

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:31.749
THEN HOW CAN IT SERVE AS A

02:26:31.816 --> 02:26:33.484
DETERRENCE.

02:26:33.551 --> 02:26:35.620
AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO DO A

02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:36.654
SURVEY.

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:39.157
OF THOSE MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:39.223 --> 02:26:41.559
WHO ARE NOT LAWYERS MOST OF THEM

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:43.494
WOULD NOT EVEN OCCURRED THAT.

02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:44.795
IT BECAUSE WE HAVE ON THIS ON

02:26:44.862 --> 02:26:47.331
THE BOOKS --

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:49.500
THINKS LIKE ACCESSORY ACCOMPLISH

02:26:49.567 --> 02:26:51.369
VARIOUS OTHER STATUTES I THINK

02:26:51.435 --> 02:26:54.105
MOST OF US ASSUME THAT.

02:26:54.172 --> 02:26:57.375
IF YOU YOU KNOW HAD THIS MORE --

02:26:57.441 --> 02:26:59.777
PERIPHERAL ROLE IN A MURDER THAT

02:26:59.844 --> 02:27:01.112
YOU WOULD BE CHARGED WITH THAT

02:27:01.179 --> 02:27:03.080
THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE CHARGED

02:27:03.147 --> 02:27:04.949
WITH FELONY MURDER AND FOR

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:07.185
EXAMPLE I AM NOT A LAWYER AND

02:27:07.251 --> 02:27:08.386
UNTIL.

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:09.954
I STARTED BE --

02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:12.190
WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION AS

02:27:12.256 --> 02:27:13.491
CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY THE

02:27:13.558 --> 02:27:15.626
EXISTENCE OF THE WAY

02:27:15.693 --> 02:27:16.961
CALIFORNIA'S MURDER STATUTE IS

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:19.230
APPLIED I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE.

02:27:19.297 --> 02:27:20.998
THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.266
WE HAVE.

02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:24.302
SERVING LIFE SENTENCES IN

02:27:24.368 --> 02:27:30.141
CALIFORNIA DIRT DUE TO THIS ROLE.

02:27:30.208 --> 02:27:31.909
ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION I TOO

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.344
WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK THIS

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:36.080
IS A A GOOD BILL AND AS WE RE

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.648
CALIBRATE.

02:27:37.715 --> 02:27:39.850
HOW WIDE AN INCONSISTENT NET

02:27:39.917 --> 02:27:42.486
THAT WE HAVE CAST AS IT RELATES

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:43.721
TO OUTLAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:27:43.788 --> 02:27:45.156
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THIS IS

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:47.592
A SOLID STEP?

02:27:47.658 --> 02:27:50.795
YES DID YOU.

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:51.662
SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR

02:27:51.729 --> 02:27:52.797
BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:55.466
AND MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION AND

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:57.501
I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK ALL

02:27:57.568 --> 02:27:59.303
THE WITNESSES THE CAME FORWARD I

02:27:59.370 --> 02:28:01.806
KNOW THAT IT IS NOT EASY. TO

02:28:01.872 --> 02:28:03.207
COME TO THIS BUILDING --

02:28:03.274 --> 02:28:04.542
IT IS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING AND

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:06.444
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME TO

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:08.079
HEAR FROM ANY BUT FROM EVERYBODY.

02:28:08.145 --> 02:28:09.780
ESPECIALLY THE PERSONAL STORIES

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.382
THAT ARE SO DEEP.

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:14.385
AND ENTRENCHED IN FAMILY WHO AND

THAT IT MORE REFLECTS THE

02:28:58.863 --> 02:29:00.498

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLICE AND

02:32:58.102 --> 02:32:59.637
THE PUBLIC ARE SOME OF THE MOST

02:32:59.703 --> 02:33:01.272
CRITICAL AND CAN MEAN A LOSS OF

02:33:01.338 --> 02:33:02.540
LIFE FOR LIBERTY.

02:33:02.606 --> 02:33:04.008
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE

02:33:04.074 --> 02:33:05.709
TODAY WHO WANT TO TELL THEIR

ABOUT OFFICER DISCIPLINE.

02:34:22.052 --> 02:34:23.787
WE CAN GET RID OF BAD ACTORS BY

DOESN'T KNOW THEIR HISTORY.

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.660

02:57:26.102 --> 02:57:27.503
BUT I MEAN THERE AGENCIES WITH

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:28.404
IT HAD REALLY BIG FIGHTS IN THE

02:57:28.471 --> 02:57:29.472
CHIEF IS PAID THE PRICE.

02:57:29.538 --> 02:57:31.907
AND THAT'S NOT OKAY.

02:57:31.974 --> 02:57:33.275
SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS FROM

02:57:33.342 --> 02:57:35.444
OTHER COLLEAGUE I REALLY.

02:57:35.511 --> 02:57:36.912

WHERE THE OFFICERS BEEN PROVEN

02:57:45.488 --> 02:57:46.822
NOTHING NOTHING WENT WRONG THERE

02:57:46.889 --> 02:57:48.691
THERE'S NO NO ABILITY TO SHOW

02:57:48.758 --> 02:57:49.992
THAT THE OFFICER ACTED OUT A

02:57:50.059 --> 02:57:52.561
POLICY OUT A LAW --

02:57:52.628 --> 02:57:54.030
SUPPOSING THAT OFFICERS TO THE

02:57:54.096 --> 02:57:56.298
PUBLIC IS A CONCERN FOR US BOTH

02:57:56.365 --> 02:57:57.633

I KNOW THIS IS BEEN COMPLICATED

02:58:01.504 --> 02:58:03.139
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK OUT

02:58:03.205 --> 02:58:04.840
SOME AMENDMENTS WITH THE THE

02:58:04.907 --> 02:58:05.074

AND THE CHAIR IN THE SENATE --

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:10.579
THE AUTHOR AND AND HER SPONSORS

02:58:10.646 --> 02:58:11.647
UNDERSTAFFED AND WE HAD SOME

02:58:11.714 --> 02:58:13.482
REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH

SOMETHING GOOD SOME IN

02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.383
[inaudible]

02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:17.219
TENSE BUT THERE IS A COURT CASE

02:58:17.286 --> 02:58:18.587
THAT IS LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO

02:58:18.654 --> 02:58:20.089
JUST OUT RIGHT.

02:58:20.156 --> 02:58:22.258
EXIT A REDACT THEIR NAMES LONG

02:58:22.324 --> 02:58:23.692
BEACH CASE MORE TRYING TO FIGURE

02:58:23.759 --> 02:58:24.960
OUT WAYS TO PROTECT THIS

02:58:25.027 --> 02:58:25.828
ALTHOUGH THEIR DIFFERENCES

02:58:25.895 --> 02:58:26.996
BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE RELEASING

02:58:27.063 --> 02:58:28.130
HERE THIS IS THEIR PERSONNEL

02:58:28.197 --> 02:58:28.998
FILES THIS IS A LOT OF

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:30.666
INFORMATION AND WE'RE NOT CLEAR

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:32.068
EXACTLY WHAT WORD RELEASING IN

02:58:32.134 --> 02:58:34.203
ITS ENTIRETY TO JUST AS A RECORD.

02:58:34.270 --> 02:58:34.970
RELATED TO THE FINAL WE DON'T

02:58:35.037 --> 02:58:38.140
KNOW WHAT THE RECORD SO.

02:58:38.207 --> 02:58:39.108
SOME CLARITY THERE WOULD BE VERY

02:58:39.175 --> 02:58:41.210
HELPFUL BUT ALSO SOME WAY TO

02:58:41.277 --> 02:58:42.645
PROTECT THE INFORMATION FOR THE

02:58:42.711 --> 02:58:44.513

ELIMINATE UNFOUNDED CASES.

02:58:52.755 --> 02:58:54.156
SO THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL BUT

02:58:54.223 --> 02:58:55.591
THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS I NEED

02:58:55.658 --> 02:58:57.259

TESTIMONY I KNOW THAT CAN BE

03:01:23.372 --> 03:01:24.840
VERY DIFFICULT TO SHARE.

03:01:24.907 --> 03:01:26.809
I WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF

03:01:26.875 --> 03:01:28.677
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DIETS --

03:01:28.744 --> 03:01:30.145

FLORIDA AND IT'S ASSURING TO

03:01:35.050 --> 03:01:36.585
KNOW THAT YOU ARE CONTINUING TO

03:01:36.652 --> 03:01:38.354
WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:40.055
LOOK AT AMENDMENTS --

03:01:40.122 --> 03:01:42.258
I DID NOTE IN A COUPLE OF

03:01:42.324 --> 03:01:44.693
INSTANCES AND CORRECT ME IF I'M

03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.528
WRONG THAT --

03:01:46.595 --> 03:01:49.431
THE PERSONAL INFORMATION.

03:01:49.498 --> 03:01:50.766

03:01:53.602 --> 03:01:54.803
INFORMATION.

03:01:54.870 --> 03:01:56.872
IS NOT RELEASED --

03:01:56.939 --> 03:02:00.843
I THINK I ALSO READ THAT --

03:02:00.909 --> 03:02:02.845
THE RECORD SHOULD ALSO NOT BE

03:02:02.911 --> 03:02:04.346
RELEASED WHEN THE COMPLAINT IS

03:02:04.413 --> 03:02:06.148
DEEMED UNFOUNDED AND I THINK YOU

03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:07.416
ALSO MENTIONED AS AN AMENDMENT

03:02:07.483 --> 03:02:08.917
TO ADD THE WORD FRIVOLOUS IN

03:02:08.984 --> 03:02:12.421

I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME

03:02:16.058 --> 03:02:17.426
LASTLY I THINK THIS IS AN

03:02:17.493 --> 03:02:19.194
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD YOU KNOW

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:20.095
PITCHES --

03:02:20.162 --> 03:02:22.364
ARE DIFFICULT --

03:02:22.431 --> 03:02:25.367
BUT NO PERSON SHOULD BE --

03:02:25.434 --> 03:02:27.069
SHOULD HAVE A LEVEL.

03:02:27.136 --> 03:02:28.804
OF A PROTECTION IN ON IMPEACH

03:02:28.871 --> 03:02:31.140
ABILITY FROM THE LAW AND I THINK

03:02:31.206 --> 03:02:34.310
THIS BILL WORKS TOWARDS KEEPING --

03:02:34.376 --> 03:02:36.445
CITIZENS AND FELLOW POLICE

03:02:36.512 --> 03:02:38.714
OFFICERS OUT OF HARM'S WAY SO I

03:02:38.781 --> 03:02:43.152
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL.

03:02:43.218 --> 03:02:43.452
YES AND IT.

03:02:43.519 --> 03:02:45.921
COMMENTS [inaudible] TO LIKE

03:02:45.988 --> 03:02:47.890
[inaudible] TO CLOSE.

03:02:47.956 --> 03:02:49.658
THANK YOU CHAIR AND USUALLY DO

03:02:49.725 --> 03:02:51.260
VERY BRIEF CLOSED IF YOU DON'T

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:53.162
MIND SINCE THIS IS A A

03:02:53.228 --> 03:02:54.296
COMPLICATED MEASURE.

03:02:54.363 --> 03:02:56.265
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF

03:02:56.332 --> 03:02:57.099
THINGS --

03:02:57.166 --> 03:03:00.002
BUT FIRST I'LL SAY BROADLY THAT

03:03:00.069 --> 03:03:00.302
[inaudible]

03:03:00.369 --> 03:03:05.341
THE THAT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND

03:03:05.407 --> 03:03:08.143
SIX CALIFORNIA GAVE BROAD ACCESS

03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:09.311
TO INFORMATION ABOUT

03:03:09.378 --> 03:03:10.112
INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLICE

03:03:10.179 --> 03:03:11.980
CONDUCT.

03:03:12.047 --> 03:03:15.017
SO IT THIS IS NOT LIKE THIS BILL

03:03:15.084 --> 03:03:16.285
IS SOMEHOW CREATING A NEW

03:03:16.352 --> 03:03:17.720
STANDARD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN

03:03:17.786 --> 03:03:18.754
APPLIED.

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:20.255
AND IN FACT THIS BILL IS

03:03:20.322 --> 03:03:22.458
NARROWER SO IT DOES NOT RETURN

03:03:22.524 --> 03:03:24.893
CALIFORNIA LAW. TO PRE TWO

03:03:24.960 --> 03:03:26.161
THOUSAND AND SIX LEVELS OF

03:03:26.228 --> 03:03:27.730
TRANSPARENCY.

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:29.932
INSTEAD IT HAS A MORE LIMITED

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:33.268
ACCESS THAT OUR INTENT WAS TO

03:03:33.335 --> 03:03:34.603
STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN

03:03:34.670 --> 03:03:37.873
PRIVACY AND PUBLIC RIGHT TO KNOW --

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:39.208
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:41.643
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA

03:03:41.710 --> 03:03:43.078
IS AN OUT LIAR AND I WOULD JUST

03:03:43.145 --> 03:03:44.246
NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWELVE

03:03:44.313 --> 03:03:45.881

GEORGIA FLORIDA OHIO IN UTAH

03:03:51.186 --> 03:03:52.921
THAT HAVE DISCLOSURE LAWS FAR

03:03:52.988 --> 03:03:55.324
MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WHAT IS

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:56.825
PROPOSED IN THE BILL BEFORE YOU.

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:58.427
AND THAT THERE ARE FIFTEEN

03:03:58.494 --> 03:04:01.463
STATES INCLUDING TEXAS OKLAHOMA

03:04:01.530 --> 03:04:03.198
ARKANSAS TENNESSEE.

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:04.666
THAT ALLOW FOR LIMITED

03:04:04.733 --> 03:04:05.901
DISCLOSURE THAT IS MORE

03:04:05.968 --> 03:04:07.136
COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS PROPOSED

03:04:07.202 --> 03:04:09.071
HERE.

03:04:09.138 --> 03:04:11.306
NOW IN THE SENATE I TOOK A

03:04:11.373 --> 03:04:12.608
NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND I

03:04:12.674 --> 03:04:14.143
APPRECIATE THAT THE OPPOSITION

03:04:14.209 --> 03:04:15.244
NOTED THAT I'VE BEEN MEETING.

03:04:15.310 --> 03:04:16.311
WITH [inaudible]

03:04:16.378 --> 03:04:19.715
THE CHIEFS WITH PORAC WITH CHP

03:04:19.782 --> 03:04:22.951
WITH SHERIFF'S THE DA'S AND YOU

03:04:23.018 --> 03:04:24.620
NOTICE THAT THE DA'S DID NOT

03:04:24.686 --> 03:04:26.321
TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION AND THAT

03:04:26.388 --> 03:04:28.290
IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE TOOK

03:04:28.357 --> 03:04:29.858
DE A TOOK AMENDMENTS.

03:04:29.925 --> 03:04:32.294
AND NOW WHEN I DESCRIBE THIS I

03:04:32.361 --> 03:04:34.329
WAS NOT BOBBY.

03:04:34.396 --> 03:04:36.865
CLEARLY I WANTED TO REMOVE AS

03:04:36.932 --> 03:04:38.467
MUCH OPPOSITION AS POSSIBLE.

03:04:38.534 --> 03:04:39.401
I WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULD

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:41.804
REMOVE MORE OPPOSITION THEN THE

03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:43.172
JUST THE DA'S BUT THIS IS THE

03:04:43.238 --> 03:04:44.740
AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN

03:04:44.807 --> 03:04:45.674
THE SENATE.

03:04:45.741 --> 03:04:47.142
THAT DID REMOVE THE DA'S

03:04:47.209 --> 03:04:49.945
OPPOSITION IT GAVE AGENCIES THE

03:04:50.012 --> 03:04:52.214
FLEXIBILITY ON THE TIMING OF THE

03:04:52.281 --> 03:04:54.650
DISCLOSURE IN ORDER TO RESPECT

03:04:54.716 --> 03:04:58.353
OFFICERS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS --

03:04:58.420 --> 03:04:59.788
FILES TO AMENDED THAT IF THE

03:04:59.855 --> 03:05:01.423
COMPLAINT AS WAS NOTED HERE WAS

03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:03.425
UNFOUNDED THE RECORDS WOULD NOT

03:05:03.492 --> 03:05:05.727
BE RELEASED AND I'M TAKING THE

03:05:05.794 --> 03:05:06.662
COMMITTEES AMENDMENT THAT WOULD

03:05:06.728 --> 03:05:08.664
ADD FRIVOLOUS THERE ALSO SO

03:05:08.730 --> 03:05:11.967
EITHER UNFOUNDED OR FRIVOLOUS --

03:05:12.034 --> 03:05:14.169
ALSO ALREADY AMENDED WAS THAT

03:05:14.236 --> 03:05:16.004
RECORDS THAT MIGHT AFFECT

03:05:16.071 --> 03:05:17.506
CRIMINAL DISCOVERY WOULD NOT BE

03:05:17.573 --> 03:05:20.676
RELEASED SO THOSE OUR AMENDMENTS

03:05:20.742 --> 03:05:22.578
THAT I'VE TAKEN SO FAR.

03:05:22.644 --> 03:05:25.047
NOW I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE.

03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:27.182
POR ACTS EXPRESSION OR CALL IT

03:05:27.249 --> 03:05:28.650
ALL OF THIS WAS NOT ONLY THEIR

03:05:28.717 --> 03:05:30.919
EXPRESSION BUT RATHER RANK AND

03:05:30.986 --> 03:05:33.021
FILE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S.

03:05:33.088 --> 03:05:34.223
SUPPRESSION OF FEELING THAT

03:05:34.289 --> 03:05:36.425
UNTIL THERE IS A UNIFORM

03:05:36.492 --> 03:05:38.193
DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE.

03:05:38.260 --> 03:05:40.596
ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS THAT IS

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:42.431
NOT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE

03:05:42.498 --> 03:05:44.500
RECORDS RELEASED I APPRECIATE

03:05:44.566 --> 03:05:47.369
THAT AS A FORMER A MEMBER OF

03:05:47.436 --> 03:05:48.804
UNION MYSELF.

03:05:48.871 --> 03:05:50.205
THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU MOVE TO A

03:05:50.272 --> 03:05:51.273
DIFFERENT WORKPLACE YOU WANT THE

03:05:51.340 --> 03:05:52.808
RULES TO APPLY --

03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:56.111
UNIFORMLY BUT FOR US TO MANDATE

03:05:56.178 --> 03:05:58.547
A UNIFORM PROCESS NUMBER ONE

03:05:58.614 --> 03:05:59.781
WOULD OF COURSE --

03:05:59.848 --> 03:06:02.217
INCUR GREAT STATE COSTS BECAUSE

03:06:02.284 --> 03:06:04.186
ANY MANDATE OF THAT SORT WOULD.

03:06:04.253 --> 03:06:06.722
BE BORNE BY THE STATE AND WOULD

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:10.392
CAUSE THE EMPLOYERS OF THOSE

03:06:10.459 --> 03:06:12.594
OFFICERS --

03:06:12.661 --> 03:06:14.796
TO OF I SHOULD NOT BE HAPPY IS A

03:06:14.863 --> 03:06:16.632
MILD.

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:18.734
IT WOULD BE A MILD DESCRIPTION --

03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:20.602
SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO IMPOSE

03:06:20.669 --> 03:06:22.237
THAT.

03:06:22.304 --> 03:06:26.642
IN IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:06:26.708 --> 03:06:28.410
THE CHIEFS RACED.

03:06:28.477 --> 03:06:30.779
BY SOME OF THEM MAY BE A LITTLE

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:33.248
EASIER TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S WHY

03:06:33.315 --> 03:06:34.616
WE'RE CONTINUE WELL I'M

03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:35.984
CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS

03:06:36.051 --> 03:06:38.654
WITH EVERYONE BECAUSE AND I WILL

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:42.124
NOTE THAT IN A MOMENT BUT I WAS

03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:45.594
VERY OPEN. TO HAVING THE

03:06:45.661 --> 03:06:47.262
OFFICER'S NAME NOT DISCLOSE

03:06:47.329 --> 03:06:48.797
BECAUSE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NO

03:06:48.864 --> 03:06:50.232
I APPRECIATE THAT SOME OF THE

03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:52.234
SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL WOULD NOT

03:06:52.301 --> 03:06:54.369
BE HAPPY WITH SUCH AN AMENDMENT.

03:06:54.436 --> 03:06:56.738
BUT MY PURPOSE IS TO CREATE

03:06:56.805 --> 03:06:57.873
ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE

03:06:57.940 --> 03:06:59.341
TRANSPARENCY TO CREATE THE

03:06:59.408 --> 03:07:02.244
PUBLIC TRUST THAT IN AGENCY HAS

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:03.912
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED.

03:07:03.979 --> 03:07:05.581
AND THAT THEY HAVE.

03:07:05.647 --> 03:07:07.382
FOUND THAT IT WAS EITHER WITHIN

03:07:07.449 --> 03:07:08.917
THE RULES OR NOT THE RULES

03:07:08.984 --> 03:07:10.519
BECAUSE YOU UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A

03:07:10.586 --> 03:07:13.488
CIRCUMSTANCE NOW WHERE.

03:07:13.555 --> 03:07:15.090
DEPENDING ON THE COMMUNITY THE

03:07:15.157 --> 03:07:17.693
PUBLIC FEELS THAT.

03:07:17.759 --> 03:07:20.596
THERE IS NO REAL INVESTIGATION

03:07:20.662 --> 03:07:22.531
THAT OFFICERS ARE ALWAYS JUST

03:07:22.598 --> 03:07:29.237
HELD -- HELD --

03:07:29.304 --> 03:07:29.871
THAT THERE.

03:07:29.938 --> 03:07:31.940
WHAT SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER ABOVE

03:07:32.007 --> 03:07:33.175
THE LAW ARE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS

03:07:33.241 --> 03:07:34.443
EXONERATED?

03:07:34.509 --> 03:07:36.645
AND THAT THE NINE RELEASE THE

03:07:36.712 --> 03:07:38.647
INABILITY OF A JURISDICTION TO

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:40.649
BE ABLE TO RELEASE RECORDS TO

03:07:40.716 --> 03:07:42.517
SHOW THAT THEY FULLY

03:07:42.584 --> 03:07:44.386
INVESTIGATED.

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:46.021
IN I MEAN FULLY THEIR WHAT THEIR

03:07:46.088 --> 03:07:47.689
WHERE -- IT

03:07:47.756 --> 03:07:50.859
WAS VERY DETAILED.

03:07:50.926 --> 03:07:54.496
NOW CREATES THAT TRUST AND SO.

03:07:54.563 --> 03:07:55.697
FOR ME.

03:07:55.764 --> 03:07:58.266
IF THE AGENCY IT'S NOT SO MUCH

03:07:58.333 --> 03:07:59.768
KNOWING THE INDIVIDUAL OFFICER

03:07:59.835 --> 03:08:01.703
BUT RATHER THE TRUST THAT THE

03:08:01.770 --> 03:08:03.739
AGENCY HAS RULES THAT THEY

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.273
FOLLOW THOSE RULES.

03:08:05.340 --> 03:08:07.476
THAT IN AND ALSO THAT IF FOR

03:08:07.542 --> 03:08:10.145
EXAMPLE IF AYE OBTAINED IF THE

03:08:10.212 --> 03:08:11.613
BILL WERE --

03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:12.981
IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO GET

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:14.750
RECORDS AND I REQUESTED THE

03:08:14.816 --> 03:08:16.018
RECORDS UNDER THE PUBLIC

03:08:16.084 --> 03:08:17.285
INFORMATION ACT.

03:08:17.352 --> 03:08:18.754
AND IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT I

03:08:18.820 --> 03:08:19.955
WAS ONLY A SINGLE OFFICER I

03:08:20.022 --> 03:08:20.889
DON'T NEED TO KNOW THAT

03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:22.891
OFFICER'S NAME TO SAY TO THE

03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:25.293
AGENCY WHY IS IT THAT THERE'S

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:27.329
ONLY ONE OFFICER IN YOUR FORCE.

03:08:27.396 --> 03:08:29.231
THAT IS REPEATED.

03:08:29.297 --> 03:08:30.966
IN YOUR JURISDICTION THAT IS

03:08:31.033 --> 03:08:32.401
REPEATED USE OF FORCE OR

03:08:32.467 --> 03:08:34.569
REPEATED WHATEVER EGGS AND THAT

03:08:34.636 --> 03:08:36.905
THAT ALONE CREATES THE ABILITY

03:08:36.972 --> 03:08:38.507
FOR THE PUBLIC TO HOLD THE

03:08:38.573 --> 03:08:40.008
AGENCY SOMEWHAT ACCOUNTABLE.

03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:43.011
BUT DUE TO THE LONG BEACH CASE

03:08:43.078 --> 03:08:44.312
WE ARE NOW CONFRONTING

03:08:44.379 --> 03:08:46.748
DIFFICULTYWITH BEING ABLE TO

03:08:46.815 --> 03:08:48.116
PROVIDE SOMETHING.

03:08:48.183 --> 03:08:49.251
AROUND THAT BUT WE ARE STILL IN

03:08:49.317 --> 03:08:52.354
CONVERSATIONS. TO TRY TO COME TO

03:08:52.421 --> 03:08:59.027
SOME KIND OF SWEET SPOT --

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:04.866
ALMOST FORGOT MY LAST POINT --

03:09:04.933 --> 03:09:08.103
MY FAULT MY CLOSING IS THAT THE

03:09:08.170 --> 03:09:10.372
REASON I AM SO COMMITTED AND

03:09:10.439 --> 03:09:12.140
WILL CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS

03:09:12.207 --> 03:09:13.475
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:09:13.542 --> 03:09:15.210
AND THE REASON I'M ALSO CARRYING

03:09:15.277 --> 03:09:17.045
THIS BILL IS THAT I THINK I

03:09:17.112 --> 03:09:19.014
RESPECT THE PUBLIC'S.

03:09:19.081 --> 03:09:21.016
RIGHT TO NO I RESPECT THAT THERE

03:09:21.083 --> 03:09:24.086
IS UNFORTUNATELY MISTRUST AND

03:09:24.152 --> 03:09:26.655
YET AT THE SAME TIME.

03:09:26.722 --> 03:09:28.457
WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

03:09:28.523 --> 03:09:31.093
USE OF FORCE IS HAS GONE DOWN IN

03:09:31.159 --> 03:09:32.761
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT OUR

03:09:32.828 --> 03:09:34.930
OFFICERS ARE BETTER TRAINED THAN

03:09:34.996 --> 03:09:36.565
THEY EVER HAVE BEEN.

03:09:36.631 --> 03:09:38.567
AND THAT EACH AND EVERY LAW

03:09:38.633 --> 03:09:40.268
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

03:09:40.335 --> 03:09:41.837
EVERY TIME THEY WALK OUT THE

03:09:41.903 --> 03:09:44.372
DOOR IN THE ON THEIR UNIFORM

03:09:44.439 --> 03:09:46.141
THEY TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE'S.

03:09:46.208 --> 03:09:47.275
THEIR LIFE SAID RISK

03:09:47.342 --> 03:09:47.576
[inaudible]

03:09:47.642 --> 03:09:51.613
AND WE WANT TO RESPECT WHATEVER

03:09:51.680 --> 03:09:53.849
WE CONSTRUCT [inaudible]

03:09:53.915 --> 03:09:55.851
TO BOTH.

03:09:55.917 --> 03:09:58.754
GIVE THAT ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC

03:09:58.820 --> 03:10:00.555
TO TO KNOW AND TO FEEL THAT

03:10:00.622 --> 03:10:02.023
THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING RESPECTED

03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:03.859
AND YET RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF

03:10:03.925 --> 03:10:05.127
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE

03:10:05.193 --> 03:10:07.629
SUCH AN IMPORTANT JOB.

03:10:07.696 --> 03:10:09.397
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS I

03:10:09.464 --> 03:10:11.066
KNOW IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

03:10:11.133 --> 03:10:13.769
BALANCE IT MAY BE A BALANCE THAT.

03:10:13.835 --> 03:10:15.637
WE ARE.

03:10:15.704 --> 03:10:18.006
UNABLE TO ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE BUT

03:10:18.073 --> 03:10:19.841
AT LEAST WE COULD GOOD CLOSER

03:10:19.908 --> 03:10:21.176
AND SO THAT IS WHY I AM CURING

03:10:21.243 --> 03:10:23.245
IT THAT IS WHY I WILL CONDUCT

03:10:23.311 --> 03:10:24.579
WIFE TAKING AMENDMENT SO FAR

03:10:24.646 --> 03:10:25.547
WILL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

03:10:25.614 --> 03:10:26.948
THIS COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED

03:10:27.015 --> 03:10:27.749
AND I WILL CONTINUE THE

03:10:27.816 --> 03:10:28.717
DISCUSSIONS.

03:10:28.784 --> 03:10:30.852
BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR AND

03:10:30.919 --> 03:10:32.654
WITH THAT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

03:10:32.721 --> 03:10:34.256

DIFFICULT.

03:10:38.126 --> 03:10:39.728
EVEN MY IN MY SURE APPEAR TIME I

03:10:39.795 --> 03:10:40.595
CAN.

03:10:40.662 --> 03:10:42.864

LOOKING AT SUPPOSING THAT FROM

03:11:50.098 --> 03:11:53.001
THE STANDPOINT OF NOT DEMONIZING

03:11:53.068 --> 03:11:53.835

03:25:29.383 --> 03:25:29.817
SYSTEM --

03:25:29.884 --> 03:25:30.551
THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE

03:25:30.618 --> 03:25:31.752
PREVIOUS TESTIMONY CONTAINS A

03:25:31.819 --> 03:25:33.421
MAJOR CHECK AND BALANCE --

03:25:33.487 --> 03:25:36.057
THAT.

03:25:36.123 --> 03:25:38.259
IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO THE CORNER

03:25:38.325 --> 03:25:39.160
IS.

03:25:39.226 --> 03:25:41.996
A DOCTOR ALWAYS DOES THE AUTOPSY.

03:25:42.063 --> 03:25:44.131
PRACTICE AND IT WAS CODIFIED A

03:25:44.198 --> 03:25:45.466
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE DOCTOR

03:25:45.533 --> 03:25:46.567

03:25:46.634 --> 03:25:47.702
CAUSE OF DEATH.

03:25:47.768 --> 03:25:49.837
THE CORNER IS THE EXAMINER IS

03:25:56.610 --> 03:25:57.611
SEPARATE PEOPLE.

03:25:57.678 --> 03:25:59.313
AND THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF

03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:01.215
THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS TO BE HAD

03:26:01.282 --> 03:26:02.917
OR DIFFERENCES OF OPINIONS THIS

03:26:02.983 --> 03:26:03.718
SYSTEM CAN WORK THOSE

03:26:03.784 --> 03:26:06.153
DIFFERENCES OUT.

03:26:06.220 --> 03:26:07.354
THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT SAN

03:26:07.421 --> 03:26:08.589

03:26:16.997 --> 03:26:18.399
TESTIMONY BUT EXISTING LAW

03:26:18.466 --> 03:26:19.834
ALLOWS COUNTIES.

03:26:19.900 --> 03:26:21.068

SPEAK OUT.

03:30:47.601 --> 03:30:50.170
NOW WE KNOW THAT OTHER FRIENDLY

03:31:25.205 --> 03:31:27.474
SAME PERSON ADMITTED COUNTIES

03:31:27.541 --> 03:31:28.475
AND THAT'S COUNTY SO THIS IS AN

03:31:28.542 --> 03:31:30.310
INHERENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

03:31:30.377 --> 03:31:32.646
EVEN YOU KNOW YEAH SURE MOST

03:31:32.713 --> 03:31:34.381
CHAIR OF CORNERS ARE TRYING TO

03:31:34.448 --> 03:31:34.982
DO THE RIGHT THING BUT I MEAN

03:31:35.049 --> 03:31:36.450
IT'S IT'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT

03:31:36.517 --> 03:31:38.485
OF INTEREST TO HAVE THE SHERIFF.

03:31:38.552 --> 03:31:40.487
CORNER ALSO BE THE PERSON WHO

03:31:40.554 --> 03:31:43.257
OVERSEES AND DECIDES ON THE

03:31:43.323 --> 03:31:44.825
FINAL REPORT TO ACTUALLY THIS

03:31:44.892 --> 03:31:46.360
WHO ACTUALLY CAN THAT.

03:31:46.427 --> 03:31:48.896
LIMIT THE INVESTIGATION OF THE

03:31:48.962 --> 03:31:49.396
POSITION --

03:31:49.463 --> 03:31:50.831
WHOSE ACTUALLYPERFORMING THE

03:31:50.898 --> 03:31:52.332
INVESTIGATION THAT'S HAPPENED AS

03:31:52.399 --> 03:31:54.201
WELL OUT WE NEED TO BE SURE

03:31:54.268 --> 03:31:55.602
PEOPLE HAVE TRUST IN A CRIMINAL

03:31:55.669 --> 03:31:57.171
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND I THOUGHT YOU

03:31:57.237 --> 03:31:58.906
SHOULD BE AN OBJECTIVE FINDING

03:31:58.972 --> 03:32:00.140
OF FACT IT'S IN THE IT SHOULD

03:32:00.207 --> 03:32:01.542
NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS.

03:32:01.608 --> 03:32:04.044
SUBJECT TO CONFLICT AND ARE

03:32:04.111 --> 03:32:06.680
PERCEIVED CONFLICT EXPECT THE

03:32:06.747 --> 03:32:09.850
ASK FOR AND I THINK YOU WILL

03:32:09.917 --> 03:32:10.150
[inaudible]

03:32:10.217 --> 03:32:15.355
BUT THE WE'RE GONNA PUT IT

03:32:15.422 --> 03:32:16.623
CHAIRED.

03:32:16.690 --> 03:32:19.126
RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE THAT ONE

03:32:19.193 --> 03:32:20.494
BECAUSE WORK SUBJECT HERE ARE

03:32:20.561 --> 03:32:22.896
SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T WORK OUT.

03:32:22.963 --> 03:32:25.933
TO LIKE WE WE COME FROM OUR AREA

03:32:25.999 --> 03:32:26.600
HAS BOTH A SHERIFF.

03:32:26.667 --> 03:32:30.170
AND A MEDICAL EXAMINER AND THE

03:32:30.237 --> 03:32:32.039
MEDICAL EXAMINER.

03:32:32.106 --> 03:32:33.941
ACTUALLY WE HAD ONE IN THE PAST

03:32:34.007 --> 03:32:37.478
THAT WAS NOT VERY ON THAT THEY

03:32:37.544 --> 03:32:38.112
WERE DOING SOME THINGS THAT WERE

03:32:38.178 --> 03:32:39.646
VERY ETHICAL.

03:32:39.713 --> 03:32:41.148
SO IT COULD HAPPEN TO BOTH ENDS

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:43.817
STRIKE WHICH CD DID NEED TO KEEP

03:32:43.884 --> 03:32:45.752

03:32:45.819 --> 03:32:48.155
YOUR POINT HAS HOW DO WE START A

03:32:48.222 --> 03:32:49.490
SEPARATION SO WE HAVE DEALT

03:32:49.556 --> 03:32:50.324
ECONOMY.

03:32:50.390 --> 03:32:51.558
SO THAT --

03:32:51.625 --> 03:32:53.594
MEDICAL EXAMINER SLASH FORENSIC

03:32:53.660 --> 03:32:56.864

THAT WE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT.

03:33:07.207 --> 03:33:08.742
SEPARATION AND I THINK WILL ALSO

03:33:08.809 --> 03:33:09.076
HELP.

03:33:09.143 --> 03:33:09.743
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:33:09.810 --> 03:33:11.445

BACK WE EMBARKED ON THE TASK OF

03:35:01.021 --> 03:35:03.156
IDENTIFYING ALL UNTESTED SEXUAL

03:35:03.223 --> 03:35:04.858
SOCKETS.

03:35:04.925 --> 03:35:06.593
THIS WAS A CUMBERSOME AND

03:35:06.660 --> 03:35:09.129
PROTRACTED PROCESS.

03:35:09.196 --> 03:35:11.898
AND IN PART BECAUSE WHEN WE WERE

03:35:11.965 --> 03:35:13.267
THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION THERE

03:35:13.333 --> 03:35:14.835
WASN'T ANY UNIFORMITY OF

WAS NOT.

03:35:26.713 --> 03:35:27.714
THAT'S BECAUSE THE LAW

03:35:27.781 --> 03:35:28.949
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT

03:35:29.016 --> 03:35:30.751
REPORTING TO THEM.

03:35:30.817 --> 03:35:34.388
WHEN IN FACT WE DISCOVER THAT

03:35:34.454 --> 03:35:35.455
NINETEEN HUNDRED UNTESTED SEXUAL

03:35:35.522 --> 03:35:37.090

03:36:13.293 --> 03:36:15.529
AMAZING FORENSIC TOOL.

03:36:15.595 --> 03:36:16.163

EXONERATED HIM.

03:41:53.166 --> 03:41:55.135

03:42:12.352 --> 03:42:15.388
THAT SOME THE DNA ISN'T NEEDED

03:42:15.455 --> 03:42:17.390
IN THE RAPE CASE BECAUSE THEY

03:42:17.457 --> 03:42:19.893

I I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT RULE

03:54:57.316 --> 03:54:59.084
WENT AWAY BUT CLEARLY I DON'T

03:54:59.151 --> 03:55:00.619
SEE HOW A BILL DEALING WITH

SCHOOL EMPLOYEES --

03:55:02.354 --> 03:55:04.290

LAWS AND YOU WANT THE AVERAGE

03:55:12.298 --> 03:55:14.366
YOU WANT CITIZENS TO BE ABLE TO

03:55:14.433 --> 03:55:15.935
TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED

03:55:16.001 --> 03:55:17.536
BY THIS BODY SERIOUSLY.

03:55:17.603 --> 03:55:18.671
THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IF THE

03:55:18.737 --> 03:55:20.539
LEGISLATURE WHO.

03:55:20.606 --> 03:55:21.941
SETS ITS OWN RULES I MEAN THE

03:55:22.007 --> 03:55:23.375
MAJORITY PARTY GETS A CHANCE TO

03:55:23.442 --> 03:55:24.743
SET THE RULES IF THE MAJORITY

03:55:24.810 --> 03:55:26.679
PARTY IS NOT EVEN GOING TO TAKE

03:55:26.745 --> 03:55:28.247
ITS OWN RULES SERIOUSLY WHEN IT

03:55:28.314 --> 03:55:29.715
COMES TO THE PRO THAT THE

03:55:29.782 --> 03:55:32.151
PROPOSING OF LEGISLATION.

03:55:32.218 --> 03:55:32.952
WELL THEN HOW WITH THE AVERAGE

03:55:33.018 --> 03:55:34.520
CITIZEN TO TAKE THE LAWS THAT

03:55:34.587 --> 03:55:35.721
ARE PASSED OUT OF THIS

03:55:35.788 --> 03:55:37.156
LEGISLATURE SERIOUSLY.

03:55:37.223 --> 03:55:39.291
I THOUGHT I I WILL CONTEND THIS

03:55:39.358 --> 03:55:40.826
BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE

03:55:40.893 --> 03:55:43.229
THE THE POWER.

03:55:43.295 --> 03:55:44.964
YOU DO IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY

03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:46.298
MEAN THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THING

03:55:46.365 --> 03:55:48.334
TO DO WHEN YOU ESTABLISH RULES

03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:50.336
AT THE VERY LEAST THIS BODY

03:55:50.402 --> 03:55:51.704
OUGHT TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT

03:55:51.770 --> 03:55:52.705
IT IS SAID.

03:55:52.771 --> 03:55:54.173
THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL ARE

03:55:54.240 --> 03:55:55.941
NOT GERMANE TO THE ORIGINAL

03:55:56.008 --> 03:55:57.743
TOPIC I DON'T SEE HOW ANYBODY A

03:55:57.810 --> 03:55:59.044
WHO CLAIMS TO BE LITERATE CAN

03:55:59.111 --> 03:56:00.880
READ IT AND SAY THAT IS GERMANE

03:56:00.946 --> 03:56:02.181
TO THE ORIGINAL TOPIC.

03:56:02.248 --> 03:56:03.449
AND THEREFORE I THINK THIS BILL

03:56:03.516 --> 03:56:04.049
SHOULD BE REJECTED [inaudible]

THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS VERY

03:56:24.637 --> 03:56:25.504
IMPORTANT.

04:07:27.766 --> 04:07:29.401
THE MAP THE VAST MAJORITY OF

THEM HAVE LITTLE OR NO CRIMINAL

04:07:30.802 --> 04:07:32.938
HISTORIES --

04:07:33.004 --> 04:07:35.340
MANY OF THEM ARE OLDER AND MANY

04:07:35.407 --> 04:07:36.975
OF THEM ARE FOR MORE FAR MORE

04:07:37.042 --> 04:07:39.578
LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED EDUCATED

04:07:39.644 --> 04:07:41.313

CHRONOLOGICAL AGE.

04:07:49.754 --> 04:07:52.324
SO THIS WOULD BE --

04:07:52.390 --> 04:07:54.459
THIS WOULD BE PUBLIC POLICY THAT

04:07:54.526 --> 04:07:56.728
IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED IT'S NOT

04:07:56.795 --> 04:07:58.296
FACT BASED.

04:07:58.363 --> 04:08:00.665
WE ENACTED LAST YEAR THE

04:08:00.732 --> 04:08:02.467
LEGISLATURE DID.

04:08:02.534 --> 04:08:05.337
LEGISLATION THAT WAS.

04:08:05.403 --> 04:08:06.338
AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT

04:08:06.404 --> 04:08:09.674
LEGISLATION WAS TO HAVE PEOPLE

04:08:09.741 --> 04:08:11.443

04:08:11.509 --> 04:08:12.744
THEIR RISK [inaudible]

04:08:12.811 --> 04:08:16.348
AND ABOUT WAS DONE NOT JUST TO

04:08:16.414 --> 04:08:17.916
GIVE THE CITIZENS WHO HAD BEEN

04:08:17.983 --> 04:08:19.618

04:08:19.684 --> 04:08:20.986
CHANCE TO REHABILITATE

THEMSELVES.

04:08:21.886 --> 04:08:23.021
BUT IT WAS DONE TO MAKE US ALL

04:08:23.088 --> 04:08:24.589
SAFER.

04:08:24.656 --> 04:08:26.625
BECAUSE WHEN POLICE DEPARTMENTS

04:08:26.691 --> 04:08:28.860
EXPEND RESOURCES ON TRACKING

04:08:28.927 --> 04:08:30.562

RISK CORD LIKELIHOOD TO REOFFEND.

04:08:36.835 --> 04:08:38.536
THAT MEANS THOSE RESOURCES ARE

04:08:38.603 --> 04:08:41.673
NOT USE. TO PURSUE PEOPLE WHO

04:08:41.740 --> 04:08:43.575
ARE MORE DANGEROUS.

04:08:43.642 --> 04:08:45.310
AND TO PROTECT THE CITIZENRY

04:08:45.377 --> 04:08:45.610
[inaudible]

04:08:45.677 --> 04:08:55.487
SO. ONE MIGHT SAY THAT THIS.

04:08:55.553 --> 04:09:01.159
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY --

04:09:01.226 --> 04:09:09.634
HURT NOT HELP --

WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE SPELL

04:09:28.353 --> 04:09:31.523
AS WELL FOR THREE KEY REASONS I

04:09:31.589 --> 04:09:33.525
FIRST WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS

04:09:33.591 --> 04:09:33.892
BILL WILL HAVE A

04:09:33.958 --> 04:09:35.927
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

04:09:35.994 --> 04:09:38.129
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES.

04:09:38.196 --> 04:09:39.664
WE KNOW THAT WHILE PEOPLE OF ALL

04:09:39.731 --> 04:09:42.400
RACES ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS AND

04:09:42.467 --> 04:09:44.769

ARE THE ONES TYPICALLY ARRESTED

04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:53.645
CHARGED AND CONVICTED FOR THESE

04:09:53.712 --> 04:09:55.947
OF FUNDS AS SAN FRANCISCO'S

04:09:56.014 --> 04:09:57.248
PUBLIC DEFENDER RECENTLY

04:09:57.315 --> 04:09:59.918
REPORTED THAT 60% OF PEOPLE

04:09:59.984 --> 04:10:01.319

INTENT TO COMMIT PROSTITUTION IN

04:10:03.788 --> 04:10:05.657
THE CITY ARE LATINO.

04:10:05.724 --> 04:10:06.825
AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN

04:10:06.891 --> 04:10:09.027
CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO REGULARLY

04:10:09.094 --> 04:10:11.563
TARGET AND ARREST GAY MEN ON

04:10:11.629 --> 04:10:13.231
CHARGES OF SOLICITATION AND

04:10:13.298 --> 04:10:15.100
OTHER OFFENSES.

04:10:15.166 --> 04:10:16.468
GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE

04:10:16.534 --> 04:10:18.737
IMPACT SOLICITATION LAWS ALREADY

04:10:18.803 --> 04:10:20.605
HAVE ON THESE COMMUNITIES

04:10:20.672 --> 04:10:23.074
REQUIRING REGISTRATION WILL

04:10:23.141 --> 04:10:24.809
RESULT IN FURTHER BURDEN.

04:10:24.876 --> 04:10:26.811
SECOND EVEN THOUGH AS THE

04:10:26.878 --> 04:10:28.747
AUTHOR'S NOTES AND MY COLLEAGUE

04:10:28.813 --> 04:10:30.515
THAT THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY

04:10:30.582 --> 04:10:32.217
HAS BEEN REFORMED AND THAT THIS

04:10:32.283 --> 04:10:34.552
BILL WILL NO LONGER IMPLICATE

04:10:34.619 --> 04:10:36.020
LIFETIME REGISTRATION.

04:10:36.087 --> 04:10:37.722
A DECADE ON THE SEX OFFENDER

04:10:37.789 --> 04:10:39.524
REGISTRY COULD STILL HAVE

04:10:39.591 --> 04:10:41.126
LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES FOR

04:10:41.192 --> 04:10:43.461
INDIVIDUALS PARTICULARLY PEOPLE

04:10:43.528 --> 04:10:46.631
OF COLOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND LGBTQ

04:10:46.698 --> 04:10:48.133
PEOPLE.

04:10:48.199 --> 04:10:50.034
INCLUSION ON THE SEX OFFENDER

04:10:50.101 --> 04:10:51.436
REGISTRY CAN MAKE IT MORE

04:10:51.503 --> 04:10:53.638
DIFFICULT TO GET A JOB FIND

04:10:53.705 --> 04:10:56.941
HOUSING PARENT AND REHABILITATE.

04:10:57.008 --> 04:10:58.543
INCLUSION ON REGS ON THE

04:10:58.610 --> 04:10:59.711
REGISTRATION CAN ALSO BE

04:10:59.778 --> 04:11:03.047
DESTABILIZING OTHER WAYS SUCH AS

04:11:03.114 --> 04:11:04.349
CAUSING PEOPLE TO FALL INTO

04:11:04.416 --> 04:11:06.351
DEPRESSION AND EXACERBATING

04:11:06.418 --> 04:11:07.919
OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS

04:11:07.986 --> 04:11:09.888
THIS TYPE OF DESTABILIZATION CAN

04:11:09.954 --> 04:11:12.557
ALSO LEAD TO RECIDIVISM.

04:11:12.624 --> 04:11:14.826
AND LASTLY THIS BILL IS

04:11:14.893 --> 04:11:16.928
UNNECESSARY CURRENT LAW ALREADY

04:11:16.995 --> 04:11:18.596
REQUIRES THAT ANY ADULT WHO

04:11:18.663 --> 04:11:20.865
ACTUALLY ENGAGES IN A SEX ACT

04:11:20.932 --> 04:11:22.333
WITH A MINOR BE CONVICTED OF A

04:11:22.400 --> 04:11:23.334
FELONY.

04:11:23.401 --> 04:11:24.436
WHICH WOULD AUTOMATICALLY

04:11:24.502 --> 04:11:27.639
REQUIRE DNA COLLECTION AND SEX

04:11:27.705 --> 04:11:29.240
OFFENDER REGISTRATION.

04:11:29.307 --> 04:11:31.409
ADDITIONALLY COURTS ALREADY HAVE

04:11:31.476 --> 04:11:34.245
THE DISCRETION TO REQUIRE ANYONE

04:11:34.312 --> 04:11:35.814
CONVICTED OF MISS IT MISDEMEANOR

04:11:35.880 --> 04:11:37.615
SOLICITATION TO REGISTER AS A

04:11:37.682 --> 04:11:40.251
SEX OFFENDER WHEN APPROPRIATE.

04:11:40.318 --> 04:11:42.187
SO LONG AS THE COURT FINDS THAT

04:11:42.253 --> 04:11:44.489
THE PERSON COMMITTED THE CRIME

04:11:44.556 --> 04:11:46.224
FOR SEXUAL GRATIFICATION.

04:11:46.291 --> 04:11:48.593
UNDER CURRENT LAW ANYONE WHO IS

04:11:48.660 --> 04:11:50.395
REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX

04:11:50.462 --> 04:11:53.965
OFFENDER ALSO HAS TO SUBMIT DNA.

04:11:54.032 --> 04:11:56.067
IN THIS WAY CURRENT LAW IS

04:11:56.134 --> 04:11:58.102
PREFERABLE IN THAT IT ALLOWS FOR

04:11:58.169 --> 04:12:00.605
A CASE BY CASE DETERMINATIONS

04:12:00.672 --> 04:12:02.207
AND DOESN'T UNNECESSARILY

04:12:02.273 --> 04:12:03.975
CAPTURE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT BELONG

04:12:04.042 --> 04:12:06.544
ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY OR

04:12:06.611 --> 04:12:08.179
IN THE DNA DATABASE.

04:12:08.246 --> 04:12:10.081
SO FOR THESE REASONS WE

04:12:10.148 --> 04:12:12.750
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL.

04:12:12.817 --> 04:12:13.852
THANK YOU ARMENIA AND WHAT ELSE

04:12:13.918 --> 04:12:15.653
IN OPPOSITION.

04:12:15.720 --> 04:12:16.754
MAKE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

04:12:16.821 --> 04:12:20.291
MEMBERS.

04:12:20.358 --> 04:12:22.694
FOR YOU MAY CLOSE UP FULLER

04:12:22.760 --> 04:12:22.994
[inaudible]

04:12:23.061 --> 04:12:25.296
THERE'RE LACKEY.

04:12:25.363 --> 04:12:26.564
YEAH I'M A CLEAR GOING TO BE

04:12:26.631 --> 04:12:28.233
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I

04:12:28.299 --> 04:12:28.800
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

04:12:28.867 --> 04:12:29.534
LANGUAGE.

04:12:29.601 --> 04:12:31.903
IT SEEMS TO PLACE THE THE BURDEN

04:12:31.970 --> 04:12:32.704
OF PROOF ON THE DEFENDANT RATHER

04:12:32.770 --> 04:12:34.739
THAN THE PROSECUTION.

04:12:34.806 --> 04:12:35.740
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE ROUTE OF

04:12:35.807 --> 04:12:37.575
RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT SHOULD

04:12:37.642 --> 04:12:39.344
INCLUDE REQUIRING PROOF OF THE

04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:41.179
DEFENDANT KNEW OR REASONABLY

04:12:41.246 --> 04:12:42.113
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE

04:12:42.180 --> 04:12:43.915
VICTIM WAS A MINOR.

04:12:43.982 --> 04:12:45.116
THE WORD SOLICITATION SHOULD NOT

04:12:45.183 --> 04:12:46.451
BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THE

04:12:46.518 --> 04:12:48.119
UNDERLYING CRIME COVERS

04:12:48.186 --> 04:12:49.754
ADDITIONAL LACKS THE TERM.

04:12:49.821 --> 04:12:50.822
THE COURT FINDS SHOULD NOT BE

04:12:50.889 --> 04:12:54.626
INCLUDED.

04:12:54.692 --> 04:12:57.095
AND THAT'S ALL.

04:12:57.161 --> 04:12:59.697
ANYONE ELSE YOU MAY CLOSE LANKY

04:12:59.764 --> 04:13:00.532
OTHER MEMBERS FOR HERE IN THE

04:13:00.598 --> 04:13:01.799
BILL I HAD TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

04:13:01.866 --> 04:13:03.234
LACKEY I THINK THOSE ARE

04:13:03.301 --> 04:13:04.269
SUGGESTIONS LIKE CERTAINLY

04:13:04.335 --> 04:13:05.503
INCORPORATE.

04:13:05.570 --> 04:13:07.338
AYE IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD

04:13:07.405 --> 04:13:08.139
LET ME JUST SAY A COUPLE THINGS

04:13:08.206 --> 04:13:10.375
FIRST I I VOTED FOR THE REGISTRY

04:13:10.441 --> 04:13:11.809
CHANGE LAST YEAR.

04:13:11.876 --> 04:13:16.948
AND IN A WAS CAREFULLY CRAFTED --

04:13:17.015 --> 04:13:18.349
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIOUS

04:13:18.416 --> 04:13:20.151
OFFENSES THAT THAT WOULD PUT

04:13:20.218 --> 04:13:22.453
SOMEONE ON THAT LIST AND ARE ALL

04:13:22.520 --> 04:13:23.321
ALL THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED IN

04:13:23.388 --> 04:13:24.422
THIS BILL AS THEY GO ON AT THE

04:13:24.489 --> 04:13:25.723
LOWEST HERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S

04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:26.925
GOING TO INTERFERE WITH LAW

04:13:26.991 --> 04:13:28.927
ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY. TO TO

04:13:28.993 --> 04:13:29.928
MONITOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST

04:13:29.994 --> 04:13:33.164
SERIOUS OFFENDERS ON THAT LIST --

04:13:33.231 --> 04:13:34.699
BUT IT DOES HAVE THEIR CONCERNS

04:13:34.766 --> 04:13:36.301
HAVE BEEN RAISED ON THAT ISSUE I

04:13:36.367 --> 04:13:38.102
WANT TO JUST IDENTIFY THAT.

04:13:38.169 --> 04:13:39.103
IF THERE IS A CHOICE IN THIS

04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:40.438
BILL THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO

04:13:40.505 --> 04:13:42.006
ME WOULD NOT BE THE REGISTRY

04:13:42.073 --> 04:13:43.207
ISSUE WOULD BE WOULD BE THE

04:13:43.274 --> 04:13:45.410
CAPTION AT THE DNA --

04:13:45.476 --> 04:13:47.378
AND THIS BILL WAS BROADER WHEN

04:13:47.445 --> 04:13:48.580
IT WAS HEARD IN THE SENATE

04:13:48.646 --> 04:13:49.881
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE.

04:13:49.948 --> 04:13:51.149
AND IT WAS THROUGH THE GOOD WORK

04:13:51.215 --> 04:13:53.384
OF THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF THAT

04:13:53.451 --> 04:13:55.086
IT WAS NARROWED TO THIS PLACE UP.

04:13:55.153 --> 04:13:55.653
OF ONLY TAKING DNA FROM AYE

04:13:55.720 --> 04:14:00.091
THOSE A CONVICTED OF GAUGING

04:14:00.158 --> 04:14:01.693
BRING PROSTITUTION WITH A MINOR.

04:14:01.759 --> 04:14:02.961
I THINK THAT WAS A COMPROMISE

04:14:03.027 --> 04:14:04.562
THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT AT

04:14:04.629 --> 04:14:06.598
THE TIME BUT IT IS WHAT'S BEFORE

04:14:06.664 --> 04:14:08.333
YOU TODAY AND I THINK IT IS A

04:14:08.399 --> 04:14:09.801
STEP OF MODEST VERY MODEST STEP

04:14:09.867 --> 04:14:11.169
FORWARD IN TRYING TO ACTUALLY

04:14:11.235 --> 04:14:12.670
CATCH BAD PEOPLE --

04:14:12.737 --> 04:14:14.072
WHOEVER THEY ARE WHEREVER THEY

04:14:14.138 --> 04:14:16.708
ARE THAT I'VE IF DATA.

04:14:16.774 --> 04:14:18.476
THAT BAD SEX WITH A MINOR AS A

04:14:18.543 --> 04:14:20.378
PRECURSOR TO SOMEONE WHO COMMITS

04:14:20.445 --> 04:14:22.113
MURDER OR RAPE OR OTHER MORE

04:14:22.180 --> 04:14:24.449
SERIOUS CRIMES.

04:14:24.515 --> 04:14:25.516
WE CERTAINLY --

04:14:25.583 --> 04:14:27.518
I THINK THERE'S OF A FINE I

04:14:27.585 --> 04:14:28.152
DON'T APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF TO

04:14:28.219 --> 04:14:29.487
HAVE.

04:14:29.554 --> 04:14:30.788
BEING ABLE TO TAKE THAT SWAB IN

04:14:30.855 --> 04:14:32.156
THAT DNA.

04:14:32.223 --> 04:14:34.025
UPON THAT PERSONS THAT --

04:14:34.092 --> 04:14:36.394
CONVICTION AND ALLOWING US TO A

04:14:36.461 --> 04:14:38.062
FIFTH OF THE COURSE OF THINGS

04:14:38.129 --> 04:14:40.298
THAT WE FIND THAT THEY KICK A

04:14:40.365 --> 04:14:41.232
COMMITTED A MUCH MORE SERIOUS

04:14:41.299 --> 04:14:41.966
CRIMES SO.

04:14:42.033 --> 04:14:43.001
I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT

04:14:43.067 --> 04:14:44.302
OUR MINERS THEY KNOW THERE'S NO

04:14:44.369 --> 04:14:45.503
DIFFERENCES REPUBLICANS

04:14:45.570 --> 04:14:46.104
DEMOCRATS.

04:14:46.170 --> 04:14:48.039
ON THIS PANEL.

04:14:48.106 --> 04:14:49.007
AND I THINK THIS BILL IS THAT

04:14:49.073 --> 04:14:51.042
MODEST STEP FORWARD AND IF THERE

04:14:51.109 --> 04:14:52.810
IS CONCERN ABOUT THE REGISTRY.

04:14:52.877 --> 04:14:54.612
OR MAKE A CHOICE MISTER CHAIRMAN

04:14:54.679 --> 04:14:55.980

WORK IN IN FUTURE YEARS ON THE

04:14:59.017 --> 04:15:01.285
REGISTRY ISSUE.

04:15:01.352 --> 04:15:03.388
THANK YOU AND AT IT AND I KNOW

04:15:03.454 --> 04:15:04.322

VALLEY JUST YOU BUT WHAT DID --

04:15:16.834 --> 04:15:18.803

WILL I ALWAYS SIDE WITH OF

04:15:19.971 --> 04:15:23.041
DIESEL EXISTING LAW WE CAN DO IT.

04:15:23.107 --> 04:15:24.542
WITH THAT LAW THAT WE SHOULD ADD

04:15:24.609 --> 04:15:26.310
