I THINK I CAN SAFELY SAY I KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BEAT THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS THESE MEN AND WOMEN WALK. THAN ANYBODY AROUND HERE. I HAVE WORKED WITH THEM. THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. AND I'VE BEEN WITH THEM IN THE PRISONS. WHERE THEY WORK? I'VE BEEN IN THIS PROMISE WITH THEM. WITH IN MAY. TWO OR ACTING UP. AND HEARINGS THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING. IT IS A VERY DEPRESSING ENVIRONMENT. VERY LITTLE IN THEIR DAY'S WORK IS POSITIVE. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY IN TRADE. OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS AN ABILITY NOT TO TAKE IT HOME. I LEARNED TO IDENTIFY IN MY OWN EMPLOYEES AT THE BOARD OF PRISON TERMS ONE ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES WILL START TO TAKE THINGS HOME. AND WOULD SIT DOWN AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. THE THINGS THEY SEE. AND HAVE TO DO. ARE NEVER PLEASANT. AND THERE ARE FEW BRIGHT LIGHTS. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO [inaudible] REALLY SHINE [inaudible] SUCCESSFULLY [inaudible] REHABILITATE. THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK. AT EVERY MOMENT. IF THERE IS ANY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THIS CLASS. THE STATE EMPLOYEES. I WOULD ARGUE THEY MORE THAN DESERVE IT. AND I URGE. AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR WILL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE OH THREE WHICH RATIFIES A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. AND THE STATE. MEMBERS CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO OUR STATE WE EXPECT THEM TO REHABILITATE THOSE. IT'S FAMILIES COMMUNITY AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVANTS WERE NOT ABLE TO DO. THEY HAVE AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT EMOTIONALLY DEMANDING JOB WERE THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO PROTECT OTHERS BUT CONSTANTLY WORRY ABOUT THEIR OWN SAFETY. AND WE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT RESULT FROM THE STRESS CORRECTION OFFICERS IN JUROR IN THE WORKPLACE. A REPORT RELEASED IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. BY UC BERKELEY FOUND THAT QUOTE CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE REGULARLY EXPOSED TO DRAMATIC ADVANCE THE MAKE THE MORE LIKELY TO GRAPPLE WITH DEPRESSION. PTSD AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. FURTHERMORE THE REPORT FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS REPORT THAT VIOLENT INCIDENTS ARE REGULAR OCCURRENCE IN THE WORKPLACE. WITH ALMOST 30%. REPORTED BEING SERIOUSLY INJURED SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. 50% OF OFFICERS SAY THEY RARELY FEEL SAFE AT WORK AND OFFICERS WHO DON'T FEEL SAFE ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HEADACHES. DIGESTIVE ISSUES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE. MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF OFFICERS REPORT THAT SOMEONE THEIR LIFE'S. HAT HAS TOLD THEM THAT THEY BECOME ANXIOUS OR DEPRESSED THAT SINCE STARTING TO WORK IN THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. 28% OFTEN FEEL FILLED HAVE FEELINGS OF DEPRESSION DEPRESSION OR HOPELESSNESS AND 38% HAVE LESS INTEREST OR PLEASURE IN DOING THINGS. ONE IN THREE HAS EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE SYMPTOM OF PTSD. 10% CORRECTION OFFICERS HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING THEMSELVES WITH THE RAPING HIGHER FOR RETIRED CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AT ONE IN. SEVEN OF THOSE WHO SAY THEY THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE 31% REPORT THINKING ABOUT HOW OFTEN AND HOW FOR THE PAST YEAR MORE THAN SEVEN AND TEN HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE. MANY THAT MANY ARE SUFFERING IN SILENCE. MEMBERS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN MEDIA. ARTICLES ABOUT THIS IN ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PAY OR BENEFITS. BUT I SAY WHAT MORE JUSTIFICATION DO YOU NEED AND THEN THE THE STUDY THAT CAME OUT BY UC BERKELEY LAST OCTOBER AND I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR SB ONE OF THREE YOU SENATOR WILK SENATOR DOLLY. THE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO. BUT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE OH THREE I HAPPEN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AND LASSEN COUNTY SERVE WERE. A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS WERE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON. AND I WILL JUST HAVE FRIENDS PERSONAL FAMILY FRIENDS AT WORK -- AT THE CENTERS AND ALL THE STATISTICS THAT -- THE CENTER WILL GO JUST STATED ARE ACTUALLY FACTUAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO THESE FOLKS THEY THEY CAN IT'S VERY HARD FOR THEM TO DISCONNECT FROM TEIR JOB. THEY COME HOME AND THE THE THIS THIS IS DEFINITELY JUSTIFIED -- COMPENSATION FOR THEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. ONE OH THREE I HAD THE OCCASION TO VISIT -- ONE OF OUR STATE PRISONS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I FOUND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WORKING THERE WITH CONDITIONS THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SEE BEFORE. THE RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE BUT THEY ALSO FELT IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AND REPRESENT. BUT IT THE RESPONSIBILITY AND THEY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE INMATES. IN A CALM PRODUCTIVE WAY THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD TO DO A JOB BECAUSE THEY HAD TO GET HOME. AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT THE INMATES ALSO WERE HUMAN BEINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY WERE SUFFERING FROM -- INCARCERATION FOR WHATEVER ACTION BUT THEIR HEART THE PASSION FOR THE JOB WAS THERE. BUT I WAS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY PUT THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HANDS. SO WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO ALLOW THEM TO REPRESENT US TO PROTECT US WE MUST ALL THROUGH. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SERVICE SO WITH THAT I ASKED FOR THE AYE BOAT. THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA. SENATOR TO RUSSELL. YES I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS -- OF NOT ONLY THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT ALSO BECAUSE IN MY VISITS -- TO TWO OF THE PRISONS I ALSO FOUND OF MEN AND WOMEN THERE WHO WERE INVOLVED AND PROGRAMS. TO HELP OUR SISTERS AND BROTHERS WHO WERE IN PRISON. TO LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE LIFE THAT THEY WEREN'T STUCK IN A SITUATION -- BUT RATHER THEY COULD ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HOW DO THEY GET THE SKILLS TO COME OUT -- WHEN THEY CAME OUT? AND WORK WITH THEM WORK WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND HI -- I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT PART OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO EVERY SINGLE DAY SO I ASKED THE FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ROGER ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE THE THE THOUGHT FULL DEBATE AND AND COMPASSION EXHIBITED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE FOR FOR EIGHT CHALLENGING WORK ENVIRONMENT -- AS THE DAUGHTER OF A RETIRED CDC OUR WARDEN -- I CERTAINLY CAN ATTEST TO MANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED -- AS MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TALKED ABOUT AND SO AS WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE WORK CONDITIONS -- FOR MEMBERS OF UNIT SIX WE SHOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE ARE THE SAME CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING AND SO WE SHOULD WORK. COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S EXPERIENCE IN A CD R. CD SEE OUR FACILITY IS -- FOCUS HUMANELY.

VICE THIRTY FOUR KNOWS FOR ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS ARE CONCURRED IN. MOVING ON NOW TO FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR SENATOR MITCHELL. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL NINETY SIX BY THE COMMITTEE A BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT WILLING TO TAXATION AND CLEARING THEIR THROATS DEFECT MERELY. SENATOR MITCHELL. COLLEAGUES SENATE BILL NINETY SIX RECASTS THE SURCHARGE THE FUN CRITICAL. NINE ONE ONE SERVICES. THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS OUTDATED. AS IT'S ORIGINS DATE BACK TO THE EARLY SEVENTIES. AND AS WE S SASTERS THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM CAN QUICKLY GET OVERWHELMED IN THE EVENT. OF AN EMERGENCY. A LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCY. THE REVENUES BUT THIS BILL WILL DIRECT WHAT'S FUN THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM INCLUDING NEXT GENERATION. NINE ONE ONE INTERFACE IS NEEDED TO DELIVER IT NINE ONE ONE VOICE AND DATA INFORMATION FROM THE NINE ONE ONE CALLER TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONDER. AN INTERFACE IS NEEDED TO SEND INFORMATION ALERTS AND WARNINGS. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES THAT A FULL YEAR'S REVENUE COLLECTION UNDER THIS RESTRICTION FEE WOULD GENERATE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. BASED ON A RATE OF THIRTY FOUR CENTS PER LINE. THE SURCHARGE WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES THE BALLOT IN THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT. AND PROJECT COSTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HELP AUTHORITY TO APPROPRIATE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL ALSO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER HOW THE REVENUES WILL BE SPENT. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I ALSO STAND IS SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION I JUST WANT. TO SHARE WITH YOU -- THIS BILL SKEWS ME SB. NINETY SIX TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SENATOR NELSON I WITNESS THE FAILING OF THE OROVILLE DAM SPILL WAY AND WE EVACUATED OR BILL THE CITY OF OR BILL. UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THIS NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT IS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD THE CAR FIRE IN REDDING CALIFORNIA WHERE WE LOST ELEVEN HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND SEVEN LIVES. WE HAD A FIRE TORNADO. WE HAVE AYE FIVE RUNNING UP TO THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY WE HAD TO NINETY NINE WHICH RUNS. ACROSS WAYS AND WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE PEOPLE. AROUND OUR CITY AND SAVE LIVES AND WE HAD EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES OUR SYSTEM IS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN FAILED US. THEN ON TOP OF THAT. WE HAD THE CAMP FIRE WHICH HAPPENED FOUR MONTHS LATER. AND WE LOST EIGHTY SEVEN LIVES IN PARADISE. I REPRESENT MIGUEL YEAH. WHICH HAS. ELEVEN A NINETY I DID REPRESENT ME I IT'S IT'S NOT MY SENATE DISTRICT. BUT WHEN I FIRST REPRESENTED THAT AREA I WENT OUT AND LOOKED AND I KNEW THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS A FIRE PRONE AREA AND THAT THERE WAS SOME POINT THERE WOULD BE A FIRE THERE SO WE PUT IN A ACCESS ROAD. ACTUALLY ADMITTED A BILL TO HAVE AN X. CAPER OUT FROM THE GALLERIA. AND WITH THE FIRE FOR THE CAMPFIRE CAME THROUGH. MANY PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW THAT THAT ROUTE WAS AVAILABLE AND THEY WENT DOWN THE HILL INSTEAD OF GOING UP THE HILL. IF THIS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND EXERCISE AND WARNINGS I THINK. THE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. IS GONNA. EVERY TIME SAVE LIVES. BUT THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND ON TOP OF THAT. MANY PEOPLE THAT PAY INTO THE SYSTEM IT WAS BASED OFF OF LAND LINES. THEN WE ADDED CELL PHONES. AND THERE'S STILL PEOPLE WHO USE THE SERVICE WHO DON'T PAY INTO THE SERVICE [inaudible] NOW. I LOOK AT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THERE'S A LOT TO DEBATE WHETHER SHOULD BE. IT IN YOU KNOW TAXES AND FEES AND I LOOK AT WHAT GOVERNMENT'S PRIMARY FUNCTIONS ARE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO THINGS. THAT THE PEOPLE CAN'T DO ON THEIR OWN. TO COLLECTIVELY WE PUT IN WATER SYSTEM SO WE CAN ALL HAVE WATER SO WILL PAY A LITTLE BIT. COLLECTIVELY WE BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE ROADS SCHOOLS WE PROTECT OUR NATION. THOSE ARE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. AND I BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS ONE OF THOSE FIRST ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. pPERFECT NOW. BUT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALONG THE WAY. CHECK IN AND HELP. CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE SAFE. AND A SYSTEM THAT WORKS I WANT TO ALSO PAINT A PICTURE I REPRESENT A DISTRICT. MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT PART OF MY SENATE DISTRICT IS WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. MY WIFE AND I TRAVEL THOSE ROADS. AND NOT EVERYWHERE DO YOU HAVE CELL SERVICE OUT THERE. WE CAME UPON AN ACCIDENT. WHERE LIVES WERE THREATENED WE HAD A DRIVE A FEW MILES BEFORE WE GOT CELL SERVICE? AND WHEN WE CALLED. NINE ONE ONE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE AT SO IT CAN BE YOU CAN BE LASSEN COUNTY AND THE CALL MAY GO TO MODOC COUNTY. THEN HAS TO BE RE ROUTED FROM THE C. H. P.. TO THE CALL CENTER TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE HECK YOU'RE OUT OUT THERE. THEN AFTER TWENTY MINUTES OF GETTING RE ROUTED AND TELLING THEM WE HAVE A EMERGENCY. THEN WE GO BACK AND TELL THE PEOPLE WE HAVE HELP ON THE WAY WHICH IN THIS CASE IS. OURS IN SOME CASES FOR UP TO AN HOUR TO GET FIRST RESPONDERS THERE. SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION I AM VERY HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHERE MARK GILL OUR DUTY IS IF HE'S IN HERE I WANT TO SAY I KEPT MY PROMISE TO YOU I THE BILL DID NOT GET. TO THE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR AND I TOLD HIM OUT TO THE CAR FIRE I WOULD VOTE FOR THIS BILL. I WANT TO KEEP MY WORD I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF WORK -- BUT I THINK THIS IS WHAT GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. COLLECTIVELY WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GET EVERYBODY THE TABLE. EVERYBODY'S USING THE SERVICE SHOULD PAY A LITTLE BIT. AND WE SHOULD PUT TOGETHER A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. NOW THIS CLOSE WITH THIS I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ROSLIN WHO. CANNOT HAVE A CELLPHONE UNTIL SHE'S. THIRTEEN THAT'S THE RULE IN THE DELI HOUSE. BUT WHAT SHE HAS THAT PHONE. I WANT HER TO BE ABLE TO DIAL SHE'S BEEN ASSAULTED IF SHE'S WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND IT. THE RESPONSE TO BE QUICK TO HER. SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE I THINK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THOSE -- REGGIE AND AND MARK YOUR DUTY AND THE GOVERNOR -- FOR AND THEN THE REST OF PEOPLE THAT WORK ON THIS BILL IS A TOUGH BILL. BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON. HI TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND APPRECIATE THE THE WISE WORDS OF OUR NEWEST MEMBER ONE OF OUR NEWEST MEMBERS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM. I BELIEVE IT'S BIEBER -- AS THE THE VICE CHAIR IN IS THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE JOINT aMITTEE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT I TO SHARE THE BELIEVE. THE ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF GOVERNMENT IS THE SAFETY OF ITS PEOPLE. AND SO TO ME THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN BILL. THIS IS NOT AN IDEOLOGICAL BILL. THIS IS A PRAGMATIC BILL THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ASSISTING AND HELPING. MEET THAT PROMISE OF GOVERNMENT TO KEEP OURS OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. LIKE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BIEBER I HAVE A STORY ABOUT THE INADEQUACIES OF OUR CURRENT NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM EVEN IN OUR NON RURAL AREA. WHERE THE PINKING THAT WENT ON MISDIRECTED THE MOST CRITICAL EMT SERVICES THAT HAD THEY BEEN MORE ACCURATE WOULD HAVE SAVED THE LIFE? IN MY COMMUNITY WHICH WAS LOST AS A RESULT. COLLEAGUES THIS SYSTEM IS FORTY YEARS OLD. AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO CAN REMEMBER BACK FORTY YEARS OLD WE HAD DIAL TELEPHONES. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE INTERNET WAS I HAD NO IDEA WHAT A GIGABYTE WAS. WHAT IS CELL PHONE WAS THAT'S FORTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS NO ANALOG THERE WAS NO DIGITAL? THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AND HERE THE STATE THAT INVENTS THE FUTURE. THAT IS THE HOME OF THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES. THE FACT THAT WE ARE ONLY ONE OF THREE STATES LEFT IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. THAT HAS FAILED TO UPGRADE TO THE SYSTEM. IS FRANKLY APPALLING. AND WHETHER YOU THINK IT THIS IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE. THE FACT IS WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH TO YOU. BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE FIRES WHEN WE HAVE EMERGENCIES WE NEED TO GET WHAT WE CALL REDUNDANCY WE NEED EVERY WAY POSSIBLE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED WAYS WE CAN DO THAT WE WOULD BE REMISS IN OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT. AND SO THERE'S AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER SHE WE TAX PEOPLE OR SHOULD WE TAKE A ONE TIME FEE. I ASK YOU THIS WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH TO YOU. WHAT IS YOUR HOME WORTH TO YOU? WHAT IS YOUR? LARGE STOCK WORK DO YOU FOR YOUR PETS AND THE ANSWER IS. IT'S WORTH FOR MORE THAN ARGUING OVER WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE A ONE TIME. THE INFLUX OF MONEY IN FACT IT CAN'T BE BECAUSE HE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO BE REVISED AS TECHNOLOGIES IMPROVE WE NEED TO WE WANT WE DESERVE. THE MOST ADVANCED WARNING SYSTEMS IN A STATE WHERE RIGHT NOW WE ARE UNDER FIRE ALERT THIS VERY MINUTE AS WE SPEAK. AND AS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BEEPER AND OTHER COLLEAGUES OF MINE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THESE WILDFIRES AND HOW QUICKLY THEY MOVE. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF DANGER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND SO I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT. WHETHER IT'S FR WILDFIRES WHETHER IT IS FOR A CHILD AT HOME DURING A BREAK IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL DO IT WILL ALLOW THOSE WHO EITHER CAN'T GET PHONE SERVICE. OR ARE UNABLE TO USE THE PHONE TO BE ABLE TO TAXED OR VIDEO THEIR CONCERNS IF THERE IS A A PREDATOR IN ONE'S HOME A FEW YEARS SUBJECT OF A BURGLARY YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ON THE PHONE AND CALL. WITH THIS SYSTEM YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TEXT THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEND A VIDEO WE'LL KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A RURAL AREA -- OR IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN SANTA BARBARA OR OTHER PLACES WE WILL BE ABLE TO HELP. AND THAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT. REGARDLESS OF PARTY REGARDLESS OF IDEOLOGY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON IT. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES HELP CENTER. I'M SORRY. MISTER PRESIDENT I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE MY NAME. GOT A LITTLE HEARING PROBLEM TODAY. BUT I DO RESPECTFULLY ROUTE RISE IN OPPOSITION OB PROBABLY BETTER SAY IT SAID I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. OUR THE MEASURE TODAY I DO NOT DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO A NEW MODERNIZE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. ARE CERTAINLY ONE THAT INVOLVES WITH CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY BUT THIS PROPOSAL REMAINS FLAWED AND WE DEALT WITH THAT LAST YEAR ON SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES I'M GOING TO RAISE. IT'S A BLANK CHECK IT LACKS A CLEAR PLAN AND IT LACKS ACCOUNTABILITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BASED ON THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM MY FELLOW MEMBERS -- THERE IS NO NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM. THE CURRENT TAX THAT WE HAVE GENERATES APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND THAT'S LEVY DON AS WE KNOW BOTH LAND LINES AND WIRELESS ACCOUNTS. THIS PROPOSAL INCREASES AND BROADENS THE NINE ONE ONE TAX BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES. I RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BROADEN THE TAX AS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS AND STABILITY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS MEMBERS NOT US NOT LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS NOT OUR REPRESENTATIVES OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE PROMISED TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY. IT REMAINS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE THE TAX RATE TO GENERATE A TOTAL OF ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON GOING. THE UPPER CAP OF EIGHTY CENTS WOULD GENERATE MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH REVENUE AS YES THINKS LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THINKS IT NEEDS. ARE WHAT IS THE TOTAL COSTS NEEDED FOR NINE ONE ONE UPDATE. ON MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR THAT THAT QUESTION WAS BOB POSED -- TO YES THEY COULD NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT WILL THE COST OF THE ANNUAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE NEED GOVERNOR BROWN ASKED DIRECTLY TO THE OYSTER AFTER. THERE WAS NOT AN ANSWER WHEN WILL THE PROJECT BE COMPLETED AND WE HAVE JUST HEARD HOW URGENT HOW URGENT THAT IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE ARE FACING MAJOR CLIMATE CHANGES THAT DRIVEN SOME OF THESE HORRIBLE CATASTROPHES. WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT AND WE LOOK AT OUR OTHER OUR TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS HERE IN OUR STATEGOVERNMENT AW THEY HAVE NOT -- MATT WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED WHAT IF THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT THERE HAVE BEEN NO CLEAR ANSWERS AND WE DESERVE THESE ANSWERS NOW IF WE ARE TO ENSURE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY. OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SO DEVASTATED -- AND POPE TENSELY THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO WE NEED IMMEDIATE ANSWERS. THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT OUR STATE GOVERNMENT HOUSE SUPPORT TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO DELIVERING PROJECTS HAD BEEN PROMISED TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. IN A VARIETY OF OUR COMMITTEES STATE REPUBLICAN SENATE REPUBLICANS DID PROPOSE THAT THE GENERAL FUND BE USED TO PAY JUST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO GET IT GOING TO BUILD OUT THE NEW ONE ONE SYSTEM LET'S ET IT GOING. THIS WOULD EXPEDITE THE PROJECT LAST YEAR WE HAD TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH EACH MARINE MUSEUM. THIS YEAR WE HAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR DOG PARKS AND SUMMER CAMPS SURELY SURELY WE HAVE MONEY. OUR TO FIND A NEW NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM BUILD OUT IMMEDIATELY ONCE THE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL DOWN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK OUT WHAT THE NEEDS WOULD BE FROM ABROAD IN TAX STRUCTURE THAT I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE UP. BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO FUND THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND ANY UPGRADES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. THEREFORE WE WOULD REQUEST THAT A LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL AT LEAST BE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE RATE INCREASES AND TO KNOW OUR WHAT IS WORKING IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS NOT WORKING. WE WOULD ALSO REQUEST THAT THERE BE TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THIS WOULD PROVIDE FOR SOME ASSURANCE OF THE PROJECT GETS BUILT GETS BUILT QUICKLY IN THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS -- YES ONCE A BLANK CHECK THE LEGISLATURE GETS NO CERTAINTY THAT THE PROJECT GETS BUILT OR THAT IT WORKS AND WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT AND I DON'T WANT TO MENTION THE DIFFERENCE. BOB IBM'S THAT WE'VE HAD WITH SOME OF OUR AGENCIES BUT IT'S A FACT SO SHOULD WE ENSURE THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO FALL. ON THE SAME PROBLEM WE'RE ALSO BEING ASKED TO PROVIDE A MASSIVE TAX INCREASE IN PERPETUITY WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE COSTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WILL BE. I DO BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER WE TRIED LAST YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US ALL THAT -- YES IS HAD ONE WHOLE YEAR TO COME OUT WITH AT LEAST WHAT THEY WERE GONNA PUT IN OUR IF P. AS THEY WENT OUT TO BID ON THIS PROJECT. AND I HAVING SERVED AT THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN YOUR COUNTY GOVERNMENTS THAT SOMEONE COULD TAKE A YEAR. BE REJECTED THE FIRST YEAR SAY COME BACK WITH THE SPECIFICS WE'LL GET IT ROLLING THEY NEVER DID THAT SO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. AND CERTAINLY I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED WITH US SAFETY WE HAD TERRIBLE FIRES AN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. THAT ARE COUNTY IMPLEMENTED AND IT WORKS VERY WELL PERHAPS THAT'S THE ANSWER IN THE SHORT TERM AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT. BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED BETTER ANSWERS ON THIS WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT SAW A LITTLE LIKE. CLASSE AND I'M NOT SURE THIS IS GOING TO GET US THERE SO TODAY I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I TO JOIN MY COLLEGE FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF EMOTIONS AROUND THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE THERE WERE LIVES LOST. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIAIN THE CITY OF BE BURKE AND ALSO WHERE -- IN CITY SANTA BARBARA WHERE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES SPOKE ABOUT THIS. IN -- SKIN THE YEARS CAN FIRE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD LIVES LOST -- SO I KNOW IT IS VERY IMPORTANT I DO AGREE AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT IT'S AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM IN THAT IT NEEDS TO BE. IMPROVED AND IT NEEDS TO BE. DEVELOPED INTO A SYSTEM THAT BENEFITS OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PROVIDES OF A HIGHER QUALITY OF SAFETY FOR CONSTITUENTS. BUT YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS -- THAT CAN EASILY PAY FOR THIS AND I THINK THAT THE ISSUE WAS THE PAYMENT. AND I THINK WHAT FRUSTRATES ME THE MOST IS THAT WE TAKE AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE WHETHER IT'S THIS ISSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF STABILITY COMMUNITY WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. IF IT'S A AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE THEY THREW A TAX INCREASE OUR TAX INCREASES ALWAYS PROPOSED ON ONE OF THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WITHOUT IMPOSING ADDITIONAL TAXES. ON CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THIS STRUCTURE. MY COLLEAGUE HAS MENTIONED EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED IN ANOTHER IECE OF LEGISLATION A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO THAT 53% OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THAT IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE TO LEAVE HERE. IF YOU TAKE THAT TO MILLENNIALS AT 63% OF THE STATE CONTINUING TO INCREASE TAXES DOES NOT MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE TO LIVE HERE. AND I SAW SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY IT'S JUST EIGHTY CENTS BUT WHEN YOU ADD EIGHTY CENTS ON TOP OF ADDITIONAL GAS TAX INCREASES THAT CONTINUALLY RISE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SAFETY AND SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS SO THAT WE HAVE AN UPDATED. NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WORKS WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY OR YOU LIVE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. BUT THE IDEA TO INCREASE TAXES ON THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN. AND WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES IN AS IN AS IN AS FAR AS A SLUSH FUND BUT IN A RESERVE FOR TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE BUDGET BILL THAT WE PASSED ON THURSDAY PASSED OUT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PET PROJECTS. TO A LOT INDIVIDUALS DISTRICTS IT'S JUST NOT THE WAY THAT WE AGREE TO FINANCING SO THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABOUT. THE OPPOSITION IS NOT ABOUT HAVING A NINE ONE SYSTEM NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WORKS THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT THE PAYMENT AND HOW RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THIS SYSTEM. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I RISE IN SUPPORT BUT WITH A STRONG MEASURE OF FRUSTRATION. OVER THIS ISSUE. I STOOD AGAINST IT LAST YEAR. THEN RIGHTEOUS GOOD CONSCIENCE. SOME OF THE SAME REASONS MY ORANGE COUNTY CALLING JUST SPOKE. LIKE MOST AGENCIES WHO COME TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR MONEY. THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN. THEY EXPECT US TO JUST INVEST IN THEIR IDEA. MAYBE IN EFFECT GIVING THEM. A BLANK CHECK. OVER THESE MANY MANY MONTHS I'VE. ADMONISHED [inaudible] AND REQUESTED [inaudible] THE PLAN. WELL FINALLY JUST THE OTHER DAY. I GOT A VERBAL OUTLINE OF THE PLAN. NOT A DOCUMENT BETTER OF VERBAL OUTLINE. OF A PLAN. THAT'S UNSATISFACTORY AND IS TYPICAL OF THE ON RESPONSIVENESS OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT THOUGH. AGAINST THE NEED THAT WE HAVE HERE. THEN THIS IS UP FRONT AND PERSONAL [inaudible] FOR FOLKS. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT FIRE. I'M IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE FIRE. THE KNOW HUNDREDS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE. TO ASSIST THE COMMUNITIES PEARL. TO DIG OUT OF THIS MESS. ALSO. I WAS A PART OF THE OROVILLE. STILL WAY FAILURE AND I REMEMBER VIVIDLY TALKING TO THE SHERIFF ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT NIGHT AS THEY WERE ANTICIPATING THE SPILL WAY FAILURE. FEELING THE WEIGHT. OF CEREMONIES BURDEN BECAUSE HE SAID CHEN D. W. R. [inaudible] ANOTHER AGENCY. BUT SOMETIMES FAILS. WE'RE NOT GIVING HIM CLEAR SIGNALS OF THE NEEDS. FOR THE IMMINENCE OF A BREAK. I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO. I SAID CORY HERE'S WHAT YOU DO YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT I WILL NOT BE BEHIND YOU I WILL NOT BE DECIDE YOU I'LL BE IN FRONT OF YOU. RUN INTERFERENCE. AND HE MADE HIS DECISION A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE [inaudible] WERE EVACUATED. AND YOU KNOW THE NINE ONE ONE WAS A PART OF THAT. THE COUPLE YEARS PRIOR. IRONICALLY I WAS IN [inaudible] CHICO. AT A DINNER. HONORING THE NINE ONE ONE OFFERS OF RESPONDENTS [inaudible] THE DISPATCHERS. AND AS I ARRIVED IT WAS A KIND OF A SPARSE CROWD IN THE DEPUTY SHERIFF CAME UP THAT CENTER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NOT MUCH OF AN AUDIENCE HERE TONIGHT. THERE'S BEEN A ACCIDENT ON I. FIVE FOURTEEN CARS INVOLVED. NOW THIS ACTION IT WAS ABOUT FIVE MILES FROM A RANGE. SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE HONORED BY US THAT NIGHT. HAD TO DEPART. TO DO THEIR DUTIES. THAT'S QUITE A MESS. LIVES WERE LOST. WE HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT IN THE SCHOOL. ABOUT TEN MILES FROM OUR PLACE THE SHOOTER. AND THERE'S NO CELL. ACCESS [inaudible] AFTER. WE WORK CHANCE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME FOR THEM. BUT THE POINT I MAKE. AS WE REACH A DECISION HERE TODAY. THE YEARS HAVE PASSED. THOUGH I AM NOT ALTOGETHER COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY. WITH THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH WHAT WE ARE QUOTE BUYING INTO. AND BY THE WAY THAT'S FLAVORED BY THESE. BILLION DOLLAR TECH PROJECTS THAT THE STATE HAS INVESTED IN FOR DECADES THAT HAVE. GONE AWRY. COST IS BILLIONS IN OVER RUNS. AND NOT BEEN DONE ON TIME. AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN ADVANTAGE BY PROVIDERS. IN THIS. SCENARIO OVER THE YEARS. COSTING TAXPAYERS A LOT MORE. THAN IT SHOULD AND WE HAVE NOT HAD GOOD OVERSIGHT THE AGENCIES IN CHARGE OF OVERSIGHT. NOW I THINK IT'S CALLED DO IT. HAVE NOT DONE THE JOB. BUT THAT BEGS THE ISSUE OF WHERE WE'RE AT THIS MOMENT THIS MOMENT. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM I WISH I KNEW EXACTLY HOW AND MORE ABOUT IT. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T. BUT AS LONG AS I'M PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND AS VICE CHAIRMAN. I WILL GUARANTEE THAT I WILL BE A CONSCIENCE WATCHING OVER THIS THAT IT IS IMPLEMENTED FULLY ON TIME. THEN ON BUDGET. THIS IS TRULY A CRITICAL ISSUE THIS IS A LIFE AND DEATH ISSUE THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MANY OTHER ISSUES WE WILL EVER CONSIDER. TODAY I URGE AN AYE VOTE SENATOR BORCHERS. RESIDENT -- I WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING ON THIS ISSUE I THINK YOU CAN CAN TELL MY COLLEAGUES CAN TELL THERE'S A SPLIT. AMONG SOME OF US. BOB BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S A FALSE CHOICE THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED HERE. THAT YOU EITHER CREATE THE TAX TO SAVE LIVES OR YOU DON'T IN LIVES WILL BE LOST. THAT IS NOT ACCURATE IN MY IN MY OPINION AND I BY THE WAY I REPRESENT. A LOT OF FOOT HILL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THIS IS A CUTE LY. OF CONCERN TO THE FOLKS I REPRESENT -- IN THOSE BEYOND. WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE? AND IF OF BUDGET REFLECTS OUR PRIORITIES. THEN IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ALLOW THAT BUDGET TO REFLECT OUR PRIORITIES IN THIS CERTAINLY IS ONE OF THEM. AND IT SHOULD BE A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO FUND THIS WORTHY CAUSE -- WE HEARD -- OF FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM US A SANTA BARBARA WHO POSE THE QUESTION WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH. WELL I BELIEVE THAT. ALL LIVES ARE WORTHY AND THEY SHOULD BE -- PROTECTED THROUGH GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF WHATEVER IS NEEDED. BUT THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE THIS RESERVE WITH THIS SURPLUS UNDER THESE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO MAKE OUR INVESTMENT LIKE THIS. I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. AND THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR DOING SO OUTSIDE OF THAT APPROPRIATION PROCESS TAX NOT NECESSARY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTACES BUT THE NEED IS COMPELLING. IMMEDIATE AND NOW. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE AREN'T -- TAPPING INTO THE RESERVE TO FUND THIS WORTHWHILE PROGRAM. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET BE ILL. BUDGET BILL JUNIOR THE VERY FIRST TRAILER BILLS THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT MAKING PROCESS THAT ARE VERY COMPLEX THAT ARE MULTI LAYERED. THAT TAKE US ALL A MINUTE TO WRAP OUR MINDS AROUND THE WE RELY ON STAFF AND FINANCE AND ELLIE EL. TO PROVIDE A SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. COLLEAGUES I HAVE TO TELL YOU. THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. THERE IS NO STATE IN THE UNION. THAT PAYS FOR THEIR NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY SERVICES OUT OF GENERAL FUND. NOT. ONE AND THEIR REASONS FOR THAT. YOU ALL KNOW WILL BE HERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT ARE GENERAL FUND. ALL THIS IS. VERY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. THIS YEAR WE HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE. AND FOR SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE NOW SUGGESTING WE USE THAT TO PAY FOR THIS. IN BUDGET HEARING AS RECENT AS YESTERDAY THE CLAIM WAS WE HAD SAVED ENOUGH THE ONE THAT I'M CONFUSED. AND THERE ARE YEARS JUST THE NINE YEARS I'VE SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE HUGE DEFICITS. THAT'S ONE VERY FOUNDATIONAL BASIC REASON WHY NOT A SINGLE STATE IN THE UNION USES THEIR GENERAL FUND TO PAY FOR THEIR NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY SERVICES. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE. WHEN WILL IT BE COMPLETED WELL COLLEAGUES I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY STANDING ON THIS FLOOR? VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE OUTCOME OF THAT DECISION A YEAR AGO OR WE COULDN'T GET IT DONE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST IF WE CAN'T GET IT DONE AGAIN THIS YEAR. THERE IS NO PROJECTION WHEN WE WILL GET A COMPLETED. YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES IT NEVER OCCURS TO ANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE EVER WE LIVE. IN A FIRE PRONE AREA OR NOT IT NEVER OCCURS TO A SINGLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. AND YOU COULD TAKE THIS TO THE BANK. THAT WHEN THEY PICK UP THEIR PHONE AND CALL 911- THAT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT WORK. IT NEVER OCCURS TO ANY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. AND WHEN YOU HAVE HAD THE OCCASION TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND DIAL 911- IT'S BECAUSE YOU ARE IN TROUBLE. AND YOU NEED HELP. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO SIT HERE ON THIS FLOOR. CAN HAVE THIS [inaudible] SOPHOMORIC DEBATE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OUR DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP UP AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT ON BEHALF OF ELLIE EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT [inaudible] I AM. DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEGRITY OF THIS INSTITUTION ALABAMA. A DOLLAR. SEVENTY FIVE ARIZONA ARKANSAS SIXTY FIVE CENTS DELAWARE SIXTY CENTS GEORGIA A DOLLAR FIFTY LOUISIANA A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE MISSISSIPPI A DOLLAR I WHAT A DOLLAR. THESE ARE THE STATE'S ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE FEES THAT EXCEED HE EIGHTY SET MAX THE CALIFORNIA'S DISCUSSING IN THIS BILL. IT IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT WILL HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATION DECISION REMEMBER. AS THE LEGISLATURE WE LEGISLATE AND WE APPROPRIATE. AND IN THIS TRAILER BILL WE WILL RETAIN OUR POWER AND AUTHORITY IN A TIME TO ME. TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATION DECISION UP TO A MAXIMUM OF EIGHTY CENTS COLLEAGUES. THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE IT IS THE RESPONSIBLE STRATEGIC. THOUGHT FULL THING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. MOST OF WHOM INCLUDING MYSELF NO LONGER HAVE A LAND LINE.

DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT IN PRESENT LADIES JOAN THE SENATE I KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. SOME BUT VERY LITTLE THOUGH I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE BECAME THE SENATOR [inaudible] FOR THE THE NUMBER STATE HOSPITAL. IN CINEMA COUNTY. A DV INSTITUTION. AND WAS QUITE A SHOCK FOR MEDIA. TOUR THOSE WORDS. SEE THE CONDITION OF THE INDIVIDUALS THERE IN. THE GET TO KNOW THE FAMILIES. THE ANXIETIES THAT THEY WENT THROUGH. IN LATER YEARS BEGAN TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE A LOT MORE. RESPONSIBLY AS AS SENATOR. AND THE SUPPORTER [inaudible] IN. I REALIZED THAT. VERY OFTEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THAT PARTICULAR SECTOR HEALTH CARE. ARE NOT PAID THE MOST ATTENTION. TO I DON'T WANNA SAY NEGLECTED. BUT DESERVING OF MORE ATTENTION THAN THEY GET. AND WE IN THE SENATE CAUCUS REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAVE MADE A HIGH PRIORITY. OVER THE YEARS [inaudible] THE SEEK [inaudible] BETTER FUNDING. FOR THIS CONSTITUENCY. THAT IS BEING ACHIEVED IN THIS BUDGET. WITH SOME CHANGES THAT WILL ENSURE [inaudible] GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTICIPATION. THE FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES. AND I DO BELIEVE [inaudible] BETTER CARE. FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I REGION I VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR PAN -- MATTER PRESENT CENTERS I TO URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS THREE IMPORTANT TRAILER BILL. AND WOULD APPRECIATE -- THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT -- FOR DD COMMUNITY I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- SOME OF US WERE HERE DURING THE RECESSION -- WHEN -- WE HAD TO MAKE A CUTS -- TO A WIDE VARIETY OF VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS INCLUDING TO THE D. D.. OUR COMMUNITY AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE WORKED HARD. TO TRY. TO ADDRESS THAT -- I WOULD TAKE NOTES THAT ALSO -- THAT. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. IN ORDER PREVENT THAT FROM HAVE YOU FUTURE WE ALSO HAVE AS PART OF THIS BUDGET -- WE ARE MAINTAINED WE ARE PUTTING IN RESERVES -- TO TRY TO TO SURE WE CAN RIDE OUT THE NEXT -- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE DRASTIC CUTS TO THESE SERVICES. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT IS -- WERE -- TALK ABOUT PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL THAT FIRST OF ALL TO ACTUALLY OF THANK THE GOVERNOR -- FOR ACTUALLY PUTTING IN INITIALLY HIS INITIAL PROPOSAL -- OF FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. THE INCREASE -- FOR THE DD COMMUNITY AND THE BUDGET ITEMS A SO THERE'S A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INITIAL INCREASE AND FUNDS. SOME OF IT IS IT IS DUE -- TO GREATER CASELOAD BUT I MEAN IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S NOT SMALL AMOUNT OF MNEY -- THAT IT WAS BEING PUT AND NOW I KNOW THAT WHEN WE HEARD THIS ISSUE AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES WE SAID WELL. WE APPRECIATE THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD THAT STAT SAYS SUBSTANTIAL SUM OF MONEY BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE -- RATE STUDY WAS DONE SHOWING THAT -- EVEN WITH THAT INCREASE WE ARE -- STILL BEHIND IN FACT I HAVE STATED IN A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT -- WE WILL BE HOLDING A FUTURE HEARINGS -- TO TO EXAMINE THE RATE INCREASE AT THE RATE STUDY AND ENSURE WE HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESSING THE RATES -- THE FINDINGS OF THE RATE STUDY AND TO ENSURE ACCESS FOR THE COMMUNITY. BUT I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT WE HAVE ALSO -- THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE GOSHEN WITH THE GOVERNOR -- TO HAVE AN INCREASE BYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR INITIALLY PROPOSED AND SO THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RAISE RATES -- FOR A DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- AND TWELVE AT THE SAME TIME -- PROTECTING THE RESERVES WE NEED TO WRITE OUT A DOWNTURN SO WE DON'T SEE A SITUATION WHERE WE FIND AND THEN WE LITERALLY RUN OUT OF MONEY AND THEN WE COULD. HAVE TO MAKE REALLY DRASTIC CUTS SO THERE'S CERTAINLY MORE WORK TO DO -- IN IN THIS AREA BUT I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- WE ARE MAKING A VERY IMPORTANT STEPS FORWARD THIS YEAR WE'VE MADE THEM IN PREVIOUS YEARS AS WELL. DO WE NEED TO MAKE MORE. SURE YES WE NEED TO DO THAT BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND I URGE AND I'VE IT THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- IT IS I'LL LIKE ICE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO SAID -- NOT WHERE WE ALL WANTED TO BE WE REQUESTED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND EVEN WHEN THE RATE STUDY SAID THAT WE NEEDED A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. TO ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT AND THAT THIS COMMUNITY HAS. I REALIZE THAT -- GOVERNMENT NEVER -- OPERATES VERY SWIFTLY AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE A STARTING POINT SO I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS FOREIGNER MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE. AND THE MATCHING FUNDS THAT WE WILL GET FROM THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE IT TO INCREASE -- DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO FIND THIS BY THE COMMUNITY. I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE ARE TWELVE SERVICE CODES THAT WILL NOT BE FUNDED IN OUR DD COMMUNITY SO THOSE OF US THAT ARE VERY ENGAGE WITH OUR COMMUNITY -- IN OUR DISTRICTS THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY ARE DISTRICTS YOU WILL HEAR COMPLAINTS AND SOME ISSUES THAT. DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WORK PROGRAMS SO THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT TOOK PRIDE IN HAVING A JOB AND GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AT A REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM WILL NO LONGER BE FUNDED AND THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE WITHOUT -- WITHOUT THE FUNDING OF BE CLOSED DOWN. I KNOW THAT THAT IS THE CASE -- FOR MY DISTRICT AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS THAT THESE FUNDING FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT SENDING THESE PROGRAMS WILL BECAUSE THESE PROGRAMS TO BE SHUT DOWN. AND WHEN I THINK OF GARRETT OF A VERY VERY -- DOW AND INTO INDIVIDUAL THE SEVERE DOWN SYNDROME HE GOES TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH HIS LUNCH BOX LIKE HIS PARENTS OR HIS UNCLE AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT ANYMORE BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED. IT'S PRETTY DEVASTATING SO I APPLIED -- THE BUDGET CHAIR I KNOW SHE HAS A HEART FOR THIS I SERVED WITH HER IN THE ASSEMBLY ON BUDGET SUB. ONE AND I'M HUMAN SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT. I WOULD HOPE THAT SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED SO THAT THESE WORK PROGRAMS THE OTHER TWELVE CATEGORIES CAN BE FUNDED SO THIS COMMUNITY. WILL STILL HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TO HAVE THESE WORK PROGRAMS AND ENGAGE IN REAL LIFE -- ACTIVITIES THAT CREATE VALUE FOR THEM -- WE DON'T WANT TO JUST SIT AT HOME LOOKING OUT A WINDOW. THIS ACTUALLY CREATES VALUE FOR THEM TO HAVE A WORK PROGRAM THAT THEY GO. TO THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN SEVERAL DISTRICTS LIKE AT MY FRIEND DID -- MR GARCIA ON THE ASSEMBLY SITE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN'T COMPETE IN AN OPEN JOB MARKET WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT DON'T HAVE A DISABILITY I KNOW SOME PEOPLE CAN BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT CAN'T IN THESE WORK PROGRAMS ARE VALUABLE. AND IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE TWELVE CODES THAT ARE NOT FUNDED IN THIS BILL CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED BUT LIKE I SAID. WE NEED TO START SOMEPLACE AND I APPLIED THE GOVERNOR AND THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR MAKING SURE WE AT LEAST START SOME PLACE THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR BILL. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- I SUPPORT THIS -- BUDGET TRAILER BILL I REALIZE THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN A JOURNEY WE'RE GOING TO TAKE -- HEART A HARD JOURNEY BECAUSE WE ARE DATING WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL. OF OUR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IT'S THE POPULATION IS RISING. AND I THINK THAT -- IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT OVER THE YEARS. BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE FUNDS. TO FIND IT IT WAS IT WASN'T THAT THERE WAS NOT THE WILL TO FUND IT. THERE WAS A NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FUND IT. AND FOR US I AM VERY PROUD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE FUNDS. THE FUNDS THAT WERE NECESSARY. TO FIND THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM. AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROGRAM -- WAS A COURAGEOUS ACT ON THE PART. OF THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT VOTED FOR THAT AND CREATED A OPPORTUNITY THERE OPEN THE DOORS TO FUND THE PROGRAMS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. LIFESAVING. LIFE ALTERING PROGRAMS WITHOUT THESE PROGRAMS -- WE ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE. THAT PROBABLY. CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES -- I WOULD I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IS -- FAMILY MEMBER -- OF A FAMILY THAT HOUSE SOMEBODY HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THERE ARE OTHER THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES THAT. REALLY HAVE NO OTHER PERSON. IN THEIR LIVES. OTHER THAN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PAID. BY THIS FUN FROM THIS PROGRAM. TO TAKE CARE OF THEM AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH HUMAN BEINGS ARE THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOW PAID. THAT OFTEN TIMES ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD. IN THEIR LIVES. TO HAVE THE THE LOW WAGES. TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS IS SOUNDING HOW LOW THE WAGES ARE. AND I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR. FOR A RECOGNIZING THIS BY SUPPORTING. THE RATE STUDY. I VIEW THE RATE STUDY AS A TWO THIRDS DON. AT A ONE THIRD TO GO. WE NEED TO HAVE WORK DONE ON THIS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. SO THAT. PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TAKING CARE PEOPLE. IN SAN JOSE AND OTHER HIGH COST AREAS. ARE PAID MUCH MORE AND RECOGNIZE FOR TAKING CARE. OF THOSE THAT CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES WITHOUT FAMILY MEMBERS. SO FOR ME FOR ME -- THE JOB IS NOT FINISHED THE ROAD THE ROAD A REMAINS TO BE WALKED. AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE. THAT I SEE ON THE STREETS. THAT ARE DEVELOPING DISABLED THAT ACTUALLY ARE HOMELESS. BECAUSE THERE ARE LACKING SUPPORT. AND MAYBE HAVING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AS WELL. AS HAVING DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ABOUT 20%. HAVE THAT SITUATION. SO I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR I APPLAUD THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE THE THE ADVOCATES. AND I WON CALL OUT MY SEC MATE FROM VENTURA. HIS STRONG ADVOCACY -- HE SHOWED UP WHEN THEY NEEDED TO SHOW UP AND I APPRECIATED THAT OUT SO. SO AS A FAMILY MEMBER. OUR REGION I VOTE. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE FUNDING THE THE WAY OF FUNDING. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IS CONTINUED. AND THANK YOU TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE SENATOR FROM VENTURA SENATOR STERN THE FLOOR IS YOURS JUST A LITTLE EAST BUT I APPRECIATE MADAM CHAIR AND TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE -- AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD -- I WON'T BE LONG WITH THIS. BUT I'M GLAD WE'RE SPENDING TIME ON THIS ISSUE [inaudible] BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE EQUAL TO ALL OF US LIVE IN THE SHADOWS OF SOCIETY ALL TOO OFTEN AND IF WE WERE TO STAND UP FOR THEM? THERE'D BE NO ONE TO STAND UP FOR THEM. THIS IS A LONELY ISSUE. AND THESE ARE. CHALLENGING LIVES AND JOBS THAT DON'T PAY ENOUGH THAT FORCED PEOPLE INTO POVERTY WE ARE CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT CHALLENGE WE HAVE NOT YET FULFILLED FULLY THE PROMISE OF THE LANHAM ACT. BUT WE ARE MAKING AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DOWN PAYMENT TODAY SO I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANGER. FOR STEPPING UP. OUR BUDGET CHAIR MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE TODAY THESE ARE PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ALL INCOMES RACES GENDERS BACKGROUNDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT THEIR PROGRESS SO. TO MANY MORE MANY MORE. RESPECTFULLY ALL DRIVE A THE I'M SORRY ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED MADAM. SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES MORE. THEN ADJUSTS RIGHT SINCE SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE CLEAR ABOUT THE BREATH OF POLICY CHANGES. ON THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES. YOU KNOW THE DEVELOPMENTAL LEAD DISOBEY DISABLED COMMUNITY IS NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP OR COMMUNITY. NOR ARE THE SERVICES THAT THEY REQUIRE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDES. UM THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS. A SPECTRUM OF SERVICES EVERYTHING FROM ASSISTANCE ON THE WORK SITE. TO THOSE WHO REQUIRE ASSISTANCE IN THEIR DAILY GROOMING AND DAVE LIVING pSTRATEGY THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN PAYING ATTENTION. AND PROVIDING INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS AND INCREASES TO THOSE SERVICES REFLECTS THAT DIVERSITY OF SERVICES. I WANT TO PROVIDE ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION. WE'VE NOT MADE ANY REDUCTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY THE BASELINE SERVICES. THIS TRAILER BILL REFLECTS AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO. AND SO WHILE WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO AFFORD TO PROVIDE ME pTHE SERVICES. BECAUSE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS SO LOW. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS. TRAILER BILL THAT WILL ELIMINATE EXISTING SERVICE IF. WE'RE CLEAR THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL. BOATS RICE BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS TRAILER BILL THAT ELIMINATES A SERVICE. THERE WAS ELOQUENT TESTIMONY IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. IT REMINDED ME OF THE TOUGH VOTES AND DECISIONS WE HAD TO MAKE A WE ELIMINATE WE DID ELIMINATE FUNDING TO THE EARLY START PROGRAM [inaudible] WHICH PREVENT IT THE STATE'S ABILITY TO FUND. EARLY INTERVENTION. AND EARLY DIAGNOSIS FOR MANY DE DE [inaudible] ISSUES. CHILDREN ON THE SPECTRUM. WE WERE ABLE TO REFUND THAT PROGRAM A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND WE WERE REMINDED THAT THIS TRAILER BILL SHOULD AND WE MUST DO MORE IN FUTURE YEARS FOR THE ZERO TO THREE IN THE DD COMMUNITY. AND SO AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THERE'S WORK MORE WORK TO BE DONE WE'RE ALL CLEAR ABOUT THAT. BUT COLLEAGUES WE HAVE COME SO FAR FROM WHERE WE WERE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADVOCATES THE PARENTS. THE CLIENT TO THE DD SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE LAND COMMENDED THE ELEMENTAL SERVICES ACT AND ITS VISION AND MISSION CONTINUES TO BE A PALED IN HONORED AS WE GO FORWARD.

MAKING PROVISION THEREFORE TAKE AFFECT ME LEAVE THE RELATED BUT SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU SB NINE IS THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT TRAILER BILL THE BILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO PAY DOWN THE STATE'S WALL OF DEBT. AND HELPS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE DRAFT THEIR PENSION LIABILITIES. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL MAKES A THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT TO PAY DOWN THE STATE'S CALPERS UNFUNDED LIABILITY. THIS BILL REDUCES SCHOOL EMPLOYERS CAL STARS AND CALPERS CONTRIBUTION RATES AND PROVIDES FIVE POINT ONE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO REDUCE THE STATE AND DISTRICT CHAIR OF THE CAL STARS. UNFUNDED LIABILITY THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL IN HELPING TO REDUCE THE WALL OF DEATH AND PROVIDING RELIEF TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR MOORE Là. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. NINETY WHEN YOU'RE DEEP IN DEBT. IT IS WISE TO PAY THEM DOWN WHEN YOU RECEIVE A BONUS FROM WORK OR ANOTHER WINDFALL LIKE A CASH GIFT FOR MONETARY GIVE FROM. A RELATIVE SO IN THE LAST YEAR. CALIFORNIA'S UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR THE PENSION PLANS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET ROSE BY ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THEREFORE DEDICATING THREE BILLION MORE. TOWARDS CALPERS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WERE FALLING BEHIND BUT I I WISH THERE FOR THAT. THE BUDGET DID MORE AS CALIFORNIA IS FALLING BEHIND. WITH THIS MASSIVE DEBT. IT ALSO GIVES AN ASSIST TO THE CAL STIRS. BY REDUCING ITS UNFUNDED ACTUARIAL ACCRUED LIABILITY THEREFORE. REDUCING THE ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS -- IS SOMETHING THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED THEY NEED SOME RELIEF. AND THIS IS A NICE GESTURE I WISH THIS BUDGET CONSIDER DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR. FOR OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES AS THEY ALSO. NEED SOME RELIEF. THE BEST SOLUTION. IS TO PROVIDE NEW EMPLOYEES WITH A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE GIVING RAISES WITH FOR EMPLOYEES IN A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IS VERY DIFFICULT THE IN. FACTIT IS IS BIGGER THAN JUST THE REYES. AB NINETY DEALS WITH THE FISCAL STRAITJACKET AS IT IS. AND I THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS INITIATIVE. BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS RETIREMENT SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE LONG TERM. WITH THAT I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. ON AB NINETY ENCOURAGE US ALL TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO REDUCE OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITIES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.
