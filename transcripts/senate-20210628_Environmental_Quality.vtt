CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE COMPANIES

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:19.994
THAT ARE DOING THEIR PART BY

MEANING THAT THESE FILES CAN BE

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:26.100
CLEANED WASHED AND THEN REUSED

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:27.201
THESE BOTTLES ARE THE MOST

01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:28.936
SUSTAINABLE CHOICE FOR BEVERAGE

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:30.271

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:32.439
GROWING INTEREST IN USING MORE

01:39:15.649 --> 01:39:16.750
HAVE STARTED USING GLASS

01:39:16.817 --> 01:39:18.919
RETURNABLE BOTTLES. BUT THEY

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:19.953
ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF THE

STATE TO HAVE THEM WASHED

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:23.991

AN ORGAN TOGETHER AND- AS SOON

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:22.215
AS WE AS WE GOT TO EXPLORE THIS

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:25.719
REALLY EXTRAORDINARY PRETTY AND

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:26.286
INVENTIVE FUND PROGRAM THEY

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:28.888
HAVE. I IN OREGON WHERE YOU

01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:30.056
KNOW ALL THESE BEER

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.858
MANUFACTURERS GET TOGETHER AND-

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.860

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:36.296
REUSE THEM AND- THEY WORKS

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.931
REALLY WELL AND IN FACT IF THE

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:40.200
INTERESTING THING IS WE

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:42.335
ACTUALLY VISITED A WINERY. THAT

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.738
WAS USING THE THEY THEY THEY

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:46.439
DECIDED TO SIGN UP AND OF

01:50:46.506 --> 01:50:47.640
COURSE THEY HAD TO USE THE BEER

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:49.409
BOTTLES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:50.643
THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE

01:50:50.710 --> 01:50:52.645
EVERYTHING IS STANDARDIZED THE

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:53.213
WHOLE POINT IS YOU'RE USING.

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:55.715
THE EXACT SAME. BOTTLES AND

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:56.249
THEN THE TO SLAP THEIR OWN

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:59.219
LABELS ON. MON AND THE YOU KNOW

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:00.453
IT'S CERTAINLY A SMALLER BOTTLE

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:01.721
THAN A TRADITIONAL WINE BOTTLE

01:51:01.788 --> 01:51:03.256
BUT THEY FOUND THAT NOT ONLY

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:04.924
WAS IT. GREAT FOR THEM TO

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.092
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM BUT

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:06.893
SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT A

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.128
FULL BOTTLE OF WINE RIGHT THEY

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:09.796
WANT THE SMALLER BOTTLES. AND

01:51:09.863 --> 01:51:12.532
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BOTTLE

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.633
CAP SEALS IT JUST AS WELL. AS A

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:16.469
CORK. SO THERE'S REALLY NO- HI

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:18.171
THIS YEAR THERE'S NO HALLENGES

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:18.705

KEEPING. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT.

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:25.812
THAT'S CORRECT SO DAVE SO IF WE

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:26.813
COULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR HERE

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.782
AND COMPANIES CAN PARTICIPATE

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:33.219
