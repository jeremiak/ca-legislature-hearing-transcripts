ON JANUARY FOURTH THAT THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED HIS PLANS TO EXPLORE THE OPENING OF OUR COSTA OFFSHORE DRILLING ON JANUARY FIFTH I IN THE JOINT AUTHORS IN THIS RESOLUTION. A FORMALLY ANNOUNCED OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS PLAN. THIS BIPARTISAN BILL ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSES THE LEGISLATURE STRONG AND UNEQUIVOCAL OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S DRAFT PLANNED TO OPEN ALL THREE REGIONS OF THE CAL RECENT SANTA BARBARA FOOD HERE OIL SPILL. MY COMMUNITY HAS PAID THE PRICE. THESE BILLS DISSEMINATE TOURISM ECONOMIES. ECOSYSTEMS AND ANIMALS. TO PUT THE THREAT IN PERSPECTIVE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL OCEAN ECONOMIC PROGRAM. NATIONAL OCEAN ECONOMIC PROGRAM CALIFORNIA'S COAST WERE ECONOMY EMPLOYEES FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE GENERATING APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE TRILLION AND CREATES AN ESTIMATED EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND VISITORS ENJOY THE STATE'S OCEAN AND COAST FOR RECREATION EXPLORATION. TOURISM AND COLLECTIVELY THEY COMPROMISE THE LARGEST SECTOR OF THE STATE'S. OCEAN ECONOMY. THE THREAT AND REALITY OF CAT EXTRA CATASTROPHIC SPILLS EXPLAINS WHY THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT IS SO STRONG IN MY DISTRICT AND ALL COSTA REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ALL PISSED THREE PACIFIC COAST GOVERNOR'S UNITED IN THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE WILL JOIN A GROWING MULTITUDE OF VOICES SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME MANDATES ACT MANDY SACKETT FROM THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND DAN JACOBSON WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK ON SUPPORT OF THIS AJ ARE. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON. TEAR ACOSTA. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MANY SECOND ON THE CALIFORNIA POLICY COORDINATOR FOR THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE WORLD'S OCEAN WAVES AND BEACHES I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION TWENTY NINE. THE RESOLUTION WOULD AFFIRM THE STATE LEGISLATURES STRONG AN UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT FEDERAL PROHIBITION OF OFF NEW OFFSHORE DRILLING GAS. SORRY OIL THAT OIL AND GAS DRILLING IN FEDERAL WATERS OFF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN WAVES AND BEACHES ARE VITAL RECREATIONAL TREASURES OF THE POLLUTED BY AN INCREASE IN OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS AND VISITORS COME TO OUR BEACHES EACH YEAR AND GENERATE NEARLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AND COLLECTIVELY RECREATION EXPLORATION AND TOURISM. COMPILE THE LARGEST SECTOR OF THE STATE'S FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR OCEAN ECONOMY. AFTER OIL HAS CONSISTENTLY LED TO OIL SPILLS DESTROYING BEACHES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES DRIVING RESTAURANTS SURF SHOPS CHARTER BOATS AND OTHER TOURISM BASED INDUSTRIES OUT OF BUSINESS. IN FACT THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES ACROSS CALIFORNIA OPPOSE OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. OIL SPILLS ARE AN INEVITABLE INEVITABLE PART OF OIL DRILLING. WE ASK YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT THE RESOLUTION TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SO CRITICAL TO CALIFORNIA'S RECREATIONAL ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAN JACOBSON WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA I MAKE THREE QUICK POINTS. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ALL OF HER CO AUTHORS FOR TAKING A LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ESPECIALLY IS UNITED STATES DECIDES WHAT KIND OF AN ENERGY FUTURE THAT WE WANT. SECOND THING ON NOTE IS THE POLLING RESULTS FROM THE PP I SEE SURVEY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT INDICATED A RECORD LOW TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS. FAVORED MORE OIL DRILLING OFF THE COAST WHILE A RECORD HIGH SIXTY NINE PERCENT OPPOSED IT. THOSE NUMBERS ARE CONSISTENT ACROSS PARTY ACROSS PARTS OF THE STATE'S ACROSS. GENDER EXETER X. CENTER UP SO THERE'S A THERE'S A STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE RESOLUTION THAT YOU'RE DOING. THIRD I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT. THERE ARE ENERGY SOURCES OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO TAP INTO BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE WOULD HAVE IS. THEY'RE CLEAN WIND THAT BLOWS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A REALLY VITAL RESOURCE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO TAP INTO. IT CAN PROVIDE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND. IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE BEST ENERGY SOURCES THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT BLOWS WHEN CALIFORNIA NEEDS THE ENERGY THE MOST IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. SO FOR THAT IN A PREVIOUS REASONS IT WAS STATED WE WOULD. AND COURAGE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE SOCIAL. WELL AS WE DON'T HAVE A CHAIR I I THINK I LIKE NEVER BECOME ON UP. TO THE MICROPHONE THAT IS SET IN SUPPORT AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL DO OPPOSITION OR NOT. FIRST AWAY ON THE CHAIR SO.

RIGHT OR I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO THAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR. OSCILLOSCOPE AND AND WRAP IT UP BUT WILL ALLOW WILL ALLOW OBVIOUSLY COMMENTS AFTERWARDS LISTA LET'S TAKE ROTH THANK. MEMBERS GARCIA ACOSTA HERE ACOSTA HERE ALLEN. ALLEN HERE CHAU CHOW HERE EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE FLORIDA. LIMON HERE LIMON HERE MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MITSUBISHI. MITSUKI HERE STONE SHOWN HERE. OKAY NIKAU QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE HAD ALL WEEK. WE WANT TO HADN'T RESTATE YOUR. MOTION AND SECOND JUST FOR THE RECORD. MOVED TO ADOPT RESOLUTION. REAGAN ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY. I MAKE A COMMENT I'M SORRY BILLIONS. AS WELL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US. I THINK WE HAVE I SPENT QUITE A BIT TIME THIS WEEKEND WITH A LOT OF COASTAL ADVOCATES VERY VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT DRILLING OFF OF OUR COATS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THE HISTORY OF. FEDERAL LEASING USUALLY WHEN THEY ASK FOR. LEASING PROPOSALS IN VARIOUS SECTORS ALONG THE COAST IT'S BEEN TARGETED ITS BAN THOUGHTFUL IT'S BEEN DIRECTED IT'S BEEN SOMETHING WE HAVE FIVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT IF IT IF THEY'RE TALKING BACK CALIFORNIA. BUT THE FACT THAT THE MISTRESS CAME UP AND JUST LIKE IT SAID WE'RE GONNA OPEN UP ALL LEASING. REALLY MAKES WILL. THE QUESTION THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR WHAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH. CALIFORNIA HAS OVER. THREE DECADES ESTABLISHED THAT WE WOULD NOT BE EXPANDING DRILLING IN. OFF THE SHORES OF CALIFORNIA AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING THEY'RE CLOSING DOWN OIL PLATFORMS THERE AND LIFE IN CERTAIN OIL FIELDS. THEY REALLY WINDING DOWN THAT DRILLING BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN A PARTNER. THE CALIFORNIA'S LONG ESTABLISHED STANCE OF NO INCREASE IN OIL DRILLING OFF OF CALIFORNIA. THEN THE SHOWS. AND I LAUD ALL OF THE PROTESTS MARCHES. CIVIC ACTION THAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THIS CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE WELCOME HERE. THE RISKS ARE SIGNIFICANT WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ADAPT OUR OCEANS TO THE CHANGING CHEMISTRY TO THE CHANGES THAT WERE SAYING. AND ADDING TO THAT THEY EIGHT AND EXACERBATED THREAD OF OIL SPILL AND OTHER CONTAMINATION REALLY PUTS AT RISK THE. TWENTY THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR COASTAL ECONOMY THAT HAS BEEN BUILT UP OVER THIS TIME. SO IT JUST SEEMS. HARD TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING ATTEMPTED OR WHAT IS. WHAT THEY THINK THAT THE END GOAL THOUGH THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE? SO I THINK IT'S VERY PORT FOR ALL OF US AND FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS STEP UP NOW AND SAY THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND. MAYBE THEY'LL LOOK ELSEWHERE OR. BILL BUT MORE THOUGHTFUL IN HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS EVEN IN THEIR TERMS. THE NATION'S ENERGY NEEDS BUT THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR US NOW HAS BEEN INAPPROPRIATE FOR THREE DECADES AND IT'S GONNA BE A FIGHT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND YOU DO REPRESENT AN AREA THAT IS MOST THAT THREAT. BECAUSE YOU THINK EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT IF LEASES WERE GRANTED OFF OF OTHER WATERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY WOULD WOULD EVER BE ABLE PUTTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT OIL BUT IN YOUR AREA. IN YOUR DISTRICT OFTEN HANNAH BARBARA THAT INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTS OF THE THREAT IS. FAR MORE TANGIBLE AND FAR MORE RIO SO IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD AND HOPE THE LEGISLATURE. IS WILLING TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE HERE AS ARE THE LEGISLATURE'S OF OREGON AND WASHINGTON ALSO SET. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE. WELL. I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD. YEAH I WANNA SEE ALSO DOESN'T IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS. KNOWING TO NOT CONTINUE MORE BUT THAT. HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY HERE'S GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE WHAT'S COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP ESPECIALLY. ON COMPANIES THAT HAVE WHERE LEASES THEY'VE GONE BANKRUPT A AND IT'S A MESS AT THE TAXPAYERS GET STUCK WITH OUT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS PAIN FOR CLEANUP A OF THE OF THE BAND IN A. THINGS AGAIN I MUST MUCH LIKE A LOT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS WERE MADE WITH GOLD KNOWLEDGE NOW WE HAVE NEW KNOWLEDGE AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY WITH POLICY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MCCARTY THANK YOU I'M IN FULL SUPPORT THIS AND CERTAINLY I KNOW OUR COASTAL DELEGATION MISLI MON MISTER STONE'S TO CHIU. GLORIA MARTZ RICHIE AND WOOD REPRESENT THE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A NATURAL NO BRAINER BUT FOR THEM SOME OF US WHO ARE NINETY MILES AWAY. WE STILL LOVE OUR COAST TO. AND IT'S GREAT TO BE ABLE TO GO DOWN. AT TO THE COAST NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE AND NOT JUST FOR FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES WHICH YOU WENT ABOUT THAT THE THE OBVIOUS BUT JUST TO ENJOY. MOTHER NATURE YOU KNOW YESTERDAY WE HAD THE SUPERBOWL OUR LITTLE GIRLS ARE TRYING OUT FOR THAT NATURE BALL. AND IMMIGRANT. APPARENT BEHIND US ARE HERE FROM THE SAME SCHOOL AND THEY TALK ABOUT THE CUTS. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO FOCUS ON MAKES SURE THAT WE. ENJOY A I MOTHER NATURE AND. YOU KNOW. THAT THE OIL SPILL YOU SPOKE ABOUT IN SIXTY NINE WHILE PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER PEOPLE REMEMBER THE EXXON VALDEZ MAYBE IN. A NIGHT THINK IT WAS THAT WE HAD A RECENT ONE. DOWN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS. A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE KNOW THE DANGERS AND AND MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO SEND OUR CONGRESSIONAL. DELEGATION A MESSAGE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT FROM A BIPARTISAN LEVEL. WE SAW THE PRESIDENT TOOK FLORIDA OFF THE OFF THE. PROPOSAL LISTS AND WISE CALIFORNIA A DIFFERENT INDEED WE KNOW THE ANSWER BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SEND. A MESSAGE TO OUR OUR LEADERS IN INTO DC THIS IMPORT FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE. I WAS GONNA SPEAK BUT THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK OFF FROM COAST REPRESENTS I FELT THAT HUNTINGTON BEACH SHOULD WAY AND. I AS A COSTA REPRESENTED THE REPRESENTS NORTH COAST ORANGE COUNTY ORANGE ARE OF THE NORTH BOT COASTAL PORTION OF ORANGE COUNTY. IN HISTORIC OIL TOWN HUNTINGTON BEACH I FEEL THAT WHO IS VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. AND THE COAST DOES NOT JUST BELONG TO CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE OR ONE POLITICAL PARTY. CALIFORNIA'S MORE OIL AND GAS THAN SAUDI ARABIA WITH TODAY'S DRILLING EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES WE CAN NOW EXTRACT OIL AND GAS SAFER AND MORE CLEANLY THAN EVER BEFORE. IN THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA HAS VAST RESOURCES THAT MUST BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR ENTIRE STATE WHEN WE IMPORT OVER I BELIEVE IT'S CURRENTLY SEVENTY PERCENT. OF OUR ENERGY RESOURCES FROM OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WERE EXPORTING OUR DOLLARS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXTRACT OUR RESOURCES THAT BELONG TO CALIFORNIANS. NOT JUST THE POLITICIANS OF SICKNESS CHAIR BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE THIRTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND THE ABILITY TO DO THIS CLEANLY SAFE WHEN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO THAT AND MAXIMIZE THE VALUE FOR EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT I WILL BE VOTING NO ON THIS AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT STRIKE CALIFORNIA OFF ITS LISTS MATTER FACT I SINCERELY HOPE. THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION COMES TO CALIFORNIA ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA CAN MAXIMIZE NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN. AND AT THE SAME TIME OF COURSE DO THIS CLEANLY SAFELY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. IT'S MY DECISION. YES I'D LIKE TO. JOIN MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THANKING THE. AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE BIPARTISAN. PORT FOR OPPOSING OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. AS EVIDENCED IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN MY OWN DISTRICT IN HERMOSA BEACH. THREE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO. RENEW OIL DRILLING. AND IN THIS COASTAL COMMUNITY. AND. THE OPPOSITION TO THAT LOCAL INITIATIVE WAS OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. AND WHAT THAT EIGHTY PERCENT. CLEARLY INDICATES WAS THAT IT WAS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS BUT IT WAS ALSO REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO OPPOSED. OIL DRILLING THAT THREATEN THEIR COSTA COMMUNITY. THE NEIGHBORING MANHATTAN CITY OF MANHATTAN BEACH ALSO STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS OIL DRILLING PROPOSAL THAT THREATEN NOT JUST. THOSE TO BEAT CITIES IN MY DISTRICT BUT THE ENTIRE SANTA MONICA BAY SO I THINK THE EVIDENCE FROM RECENT. VOTES TAKEN IN MY COMMUNITY IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THAT WHETHER A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. WE DON'T WANT OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IN CALIFORNIA. MR KAUFMAN GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. FOR MEMBERS LAMONT FOR BRINGING US THIS FOR. I THINK ABOUT ONE OF MOST TROUBLING THINGS FOR ME IN THIS PARTICULAR. BILL ALTHOUGH I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP OPTIONS OPEN. I AM REALLY TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT THE BILL I'M SORRY WITH EUROPE WE ARE OUTLINING THE BILL. IS THE PROPOSAL IS TO IS ANY ROLLBACK AND SAFETY REGULATIONS I DON'T THINK IT GIVEN ALL THE TESTIMONY AND COMMENTS WE'VE HAD TODAY. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS PRUDENT SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THE SENATE RESOLUTION TODAY. DO WE HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MISS LIMO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SURE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND THIS VOICE IS NOT A LONE VOICE. SIXTY NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE SURVEYED IN A STUDY DONE LAST YEAR BAY PP I SEE AGREE THAT EXPANDING OFFSHORE OIL IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. STILL BY NO MEANS IS THIS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE INVITING WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO AND WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A LARGE THRESHOLD. OF CALIFORNIANS ON BOTH SIDES ON ALL SIDES WHO SAY THIS IS NOT THE DIRECTION Y. MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AS THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD AND BE THAT VOICE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU PLEASE COLORFUL. ITEM ONE AJ ARE TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON THE MOTION IS THAT THE MEASURE BE ADOPTED. MEMBERS GARCIA.
