00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:11.523
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:12.690
THE WAY IN ADDRESSING THIS

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.192

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:21.786
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:24.989

THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:36.033
LACK OF ACCURACY AND TRUTH IN

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:41.172
LASTLY I'M CONCERNED WITH THE

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:42.473
LEVEL OF APATHY WITHIN THE

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.475

WATER THEIR DRINKING OF THE

THE NINE YEAR WINDOW THAT WE

LOOK AT. ONE OF THE REASONS- WE

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.838
IDENTIFIED THAT AS A PROBLEM

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:41.705
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:43.474

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.210
ARE MONITORING. CARE PLANS TO

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.744
ENSURE THAT THOSE PLANS THAT

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.279
GET INFORMATION FROM THE

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:51.281
PROVIDER. UNDERSTAND THEY KNEW

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.816
TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROVIDERS

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:54.518
ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING THESE

00:45:54.585 --> 00:45:56.453
TESTS AND REPORTING THAT

DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:01.425
SO THE STATE HAS IDEA. STATE

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:05.195
WHY HOME KIDS TO. AND THREE OF

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.698
THOSE TESTS ARE THERE WAS.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:12.302
ISSUE WE I IN A FIVE. OF THE

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:17.341
NEEDS THAT WOULD. WE IDENTIFIED

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:17.941
IN THE RE BE ISSUED LAST YEAR

00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:19.510
AND MARK LOOKED AT AX TO CARE

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.211
FOR TO. ACT TO PER SIR. ONE OF

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.779
THE KEY. WE HAD IN THAT. WAS

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:23.580
THE STAND THAT HEALTH SERVICE

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.716
HAS FOR AGES THROUGH SIX SO

00:46:25.782 --> 00:46:26.750
THERE ARE STANDARDS THAT

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:28.218
PROVIDERS AND MANAGED CARE

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:31.088
PLANS HAVE TO. ABIDE BY WE SAW

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:33.557
THE HIGHEST UTILIZATION RATES

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:34.224
FOR CHILDREN IN THOSE AGE

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:35.692
GROUPS BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.661
MEASURED AGAINST A PARTICULAR

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.129
STANDARD. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.898
WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:41.965
THAT WE ISSUED JUST BACK IN

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.934
JANUARY IS THERE IS NO UP

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.602
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE STANDARD

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:48.672
FOR. TESTING FOR LEAD- MAKING

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.440
SURE THAT CHILDREN AGES ONE AND

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:51.575
TWO ARE GETTING TESTED AND IF

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:52.910
THEY DON'T GET TESTED. THEY

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.512
HAVE TO BE TESTED BY AGE SIX-

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.814
SO WE WERE LOOKING TO SEE IF

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:58.882
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.218
SERVICES HAD A STAB TO PERFORM

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:05.422
STAND THEY HAD NOT. THEY TO OUR

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:08.592
CA. IS IT. ANOTHER YEAR BE THE

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.928
X. COMPLETE THAT PARTICULAR. SO

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:11.695
THAT'S AN ISSUE WE HAD WITH

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:12.763
RESPECT TO HEALTH SERVICE. THE

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:14.331
FINAL ISSUE WHEN IT THIS

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:16.567
GROUPING IS RELATED TO OUT AND

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:18.468
EDUCATION NOT JUST EDUCATING

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.003
PROVIDERS ABOUT THE NEED TO

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.005
PROVIDE THIS TESTER. MAKE SURE

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.106
THAT THIS TEST IS GIVEN TO

00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:26.944
CHILDREN BUT EDUCATING FAMILIES

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:27.978
ABOUT PREVENTIVE SERVICES FIRST

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:37.287
OF ALL. BUT SO BILL A TO F.

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:38.422
TILED IS TEST. BACK TO CATIA.

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:40.157
STE OUR SERVICES THEY HAVE

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:41.525
ACCESS THROUGH LOCAL PREVENTION

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:43.694
PROGRAMS TO GET THE PROPER CARE

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.362
THAT THAT CHILD NEEDS TO GET

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.798
THAT LED. ELIMINATED FROM THEIR

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:49.199
BODY ESSENTIALLY REDUCE THOSE

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:50.767
THOSE SERVICES SO THEY WEREN'T

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.836
AGAIN HEALTH CARE SERVICES NOT

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.571
DOING ENOUGH TO INFORM FAMILIES

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:55.806
MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:57.908
AWARE. OF SERVICES THAT ARE

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.509
AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO THAT'S IT

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.677
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:02.112
SERVICES ISSUES WHICH MISTER

00:48:02.179 --> 00:48:03.046
CLINAL STEP THROUGH IN A

00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:04.681
MOMENT. THE SECOND KEY AREAS

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:06.550
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.018
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.086
A MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:11.321
IDENTIFYING RISK AREA IN THE

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:13.123
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:15.525
SOME ON THE DAY YES YOU HAVE SO

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:16.627
GRAPHICS WE LOOK INTO YOUR

00:48:16.693 --> 00:48:18.295
SPECIFIC DISTRICT WE DID IF

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:20.998
SHARES OF EACH OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:25.402
TO OFFER. INTERACTIVE MAP OF

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:27.337
CALIFORNIA ON OUR WEBSITE SO

00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:29.339
FOLKS COULD GO IN AND SEE OUR

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:31.141
THEIR- CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.876
TESTED IN WET HIGH LEVELS OF

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.178
LEAD IN MY COMMUNITY- ARE THEIR

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.748
HOT SPOTS IN MY COMMUNITY. THIS

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:38.215
IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.783
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.251
RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.253
IDENTIFYING RISK IN THE STATE.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.222
IDENTIFYING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.224
THAT MAY HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:49.026
LEAD OR HAVE CHILDREN WHO HAVE

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.894
TAPPED BEEN TESTED AND- I'VE

00:48:50.961 --> 00:48:52.429
BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:54.431
HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT MEANS

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.366
OTHER CHILDREN IN THAT REGION-

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.834
ARE POTENTIALLY BEING EXPOSED

00:48:57.901 --> 00:48:59.603
TO LEAD POISONING AND THOSE.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.204
ARE NEED TO BE TESTED SO THAT'S

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:06.009
ANOTHER ISSUE. SO PUBLIC HEALTH

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:07.911
NEEDS TO ASSIST IN ABATEMENT.

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:09.880
MAKING SURE THAT. LEAD

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:11.515
ABATEMENT IS OCCURRING IN THE

00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:13.417
COMMUNITIES AND WHAT WE FOUND

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:14.851
WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT IS

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:16.887
THERE PRIMARILY JUST MONITORING

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:19.289
ABATEMENT. FOR THOSE HOMES FOR

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.857
WHICH CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TESTED

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.526
AND ENDED UP WITH A POSITIVE

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:24.261
RESULT SO NOT BEING MORE

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.796
PROACTIVE WE WOULD HAVE WOULD

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.197
HAVE EXPECTED PUBLIC HEALTH TO

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:30.000
BE MORE PROACTIVE- WITH RESPECT

00:49:30.067 --> 00:49:30.934
TO IDENTIFYING RISK AREAS AND

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.703
THEN DOING WHAT IT CAN WORKING

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:34.638
WITH THE LOCALS. TO ABATE THOSE

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:37.274
THOSE- AREAS THAT HAVE LED

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.975
POISE. AND THEN THE LAST ISSUE

00:49:39.042 --> 00:49:40.610
IN THIS AREA AGAIN IS MORE

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:41.945
ABOUT EDUCATION AND BEING

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.748
PROACTIVE- AND CREATING ONLINE

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.550
REGISTRIES ESSENTIALLY

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.018
INFORMATION THAT SOME OTHER

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:49.653
STATES PROVIDE ON THEIR

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.988
WEBSITES. OF AREAS IN

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:54.291
CALIFORNIA OR COMMUNITIES IN

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:55.726
CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE HIGH

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:57.694
LEVELS OF LEAD THAT HAVE HAD

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.863
MULTIPLE CHILDREN TESTED WHERE

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.264
THEY THEY WERE IDENTIFIED TO

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:02.933
HAVE LEAD POISONING. AND THIS

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:05.035
REALLY WOULD PROVIDE VALUABLE

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.470
INFORMATION TO PEOPLE IN THE

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.205
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT THE

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.273
REGIONS IN THE STATE. THE LAST

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.475
AREA WAS REALLY LOOKING AT

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:13.343
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND THERE

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.145
ARE A VARIETY OF STATUTORY

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:16.246
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THE

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:18.248
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH HAS.

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:20.150
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:20.617
SURE THEY HAVE CERTAIN

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:21.818
INFORMATION ON THE WEBSITE

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.387
THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:25.689
A RESPONSIBLE FOR CRUDE

00:50:25.756 --> 00:50:28.225
COMPLETING A BIENNIAL REPORT A

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.726
LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.361
PROGRAMS AND THEN FINALLY

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:32.796
DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THAT

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:35.766
WOULD LAY OUT WHAT ARE THE RISK-FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:38.368
ASSESSED. IN A COMMUNITY I'M

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:39.870
NOT JUST PERHAPS THE USE OF

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.605
LEAD PAINT AND HOUSING BUT

00:50:41.671 --> 00:50:42.773
THERE ARE OTHER RISK FACTORS

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.408
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:45.909
IN REGULATIONS AND WE WERE

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:46.576
SEEING AND YOU'LL SEE IN A

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.879
GRAPHIC. OTHER STATES HAVE A

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.313
LOT MUCH BROADER LIST OF

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.116
FACTORS THAT THE STATE SHOULD

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:55.051
BE CONSIDERING AND PROVIDER

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:55.952
SHOULD BE CONSIDERING WHEN

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.687
THEY'RE ASSESSING THE RISK OF A

00:50:57.754 --> 00:51:00.424
CHILD BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.559
POISONING. THE LAST TWO AREAS

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.161
RELATED TO PUBLIC HEALTH WORK.

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:05.762
WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED PUBLIC

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.564
HEALTH ADVOCATE MORE FOR

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.366
CHANGES TO STATE LAW WITH

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.735
RESPECT TO REPORTING WHAT LABS

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.503
ACTUALLY REPORT TO THE STATE OF

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.939
CALIFORNIA. AND YOU'LL SEE WHEN

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.174
MISTER HOOPER STEPS YOU THROUGH

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.075
SOME OF THE GRAPHICS A LARGE

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:21.211
NUMBER OF TESTS THAT HAVE NOT

00:51:21.278 --> 00:51:22.512
BEEN PROCESS BECAUSE THERE

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:23.914
ISN'T ENOUGH IDENTIFIABLE

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.782
INFORMATION. OUGHT TO BE ABLE

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.984
TO TIE THAT TASK TO A SPECIFIC

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.519
MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES IDEA

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:32.556
CHILD- SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:33.924
WE FELT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED I

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.625
KNOW THAT SOME OF THIS IS BEING

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.394
ADDRESSED IN IN LEGISLATION.

00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:38.595
AND THEN THE LAST YEAR WITH

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:39.796
RESPECT TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:42.399
THEY ALLOCATE MONIES TO LOCAL-

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.534
PROGRAMS. THESE LOCAL

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:47.304
PREVENTION PROGRAMS BUT WHEN WE

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.071
LOOK AT THEIR ALLOCATION

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:51.374
METHODOLOGIES AND THE FUNDING

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.410
THAT'S GOING TO DIFFERENT

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:54.044
COMMUNITY TO GET WHERE A GRAPH.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.813
PACKET IT REALLY SHOWS.VERITY

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.181
AND- THEY PROVIDE PLANS TO LOW

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:01.184
LOW ENTITIES. OUT THERE USING

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:04.654
INFORMATION THAT IS DATE BACK

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:07.224
TO TWO THOUSAND AND SO THEY

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.993
HAVE AN UP IN THAT. FORM

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:11.561
REFLECT WHAT. IS BEING DONE OF

00:52:11.628 --> 00:52:12.729
FIGHTING FOR HIS FOR AS THE

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:13.497
NUMBER OF KIDS BEING TEST. AND

00:52:13.563 --> 00:52:14.130
WHICH COMMUNITY REALLY NEED THE

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.298
FUNDING SO THERE'S REALLY A

00:52:15.365 --> 00:52:17.901
DISPARITY IN AB PROBLEM AND HOW

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.870
THEY'RE ALLOCATING THE FUNDS.

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:20.937
TO THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:24.040
DEAL WITH- THIS THIS SITUATION-

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:24.708

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.611
TESTS AS REQUIRED. BUT TODAY

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:09.713
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THOSE AUDITS

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:10.313
THAT AUDIT SOME THINGS HAVE

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.248
CHANGED. THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.550
HEALTH SERVICES HAS BEEN SPLIT

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.751
INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.086
CARE SERVICE HEALTH CARE

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.921
SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:19.823
UNFORTUNATELY IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:20.357
MY TESTING RATES HAVE BEEN

00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:23.860
SLOWER. AS SHOWN ON PAGE THREE

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:24.361
OF THE DOCUMENT THAT WE

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:26.363
PROVIDED TO YOU. AND AS

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:28.465
CHAIRPERSON SALAS DESCRIBED.

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.734
DURING THE LAST NINE YEARS ONE

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.335
POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN IN

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:34.104
MEDI CAL DID NOT RECEIVE THE

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.239
REQUIRED LIKE TESS. ONLY TWENTY

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:38.775
FIRST 27% OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:39.476
ARE RECEIVING ALL OF THE

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:42.045
REQUIRED TESTS. AND THE STATE

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.446
STILL IS NOT CREATED A PROCESS

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:45.615
TO IDENTIFY AND EDUCATE THE

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:47.584
SPECIFIC PROVIDERS WHO ARE

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.252
FAILING TO PROVIDE THE STATUS.

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.353
IN OUR AUDIT PUBLISHED IN

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.821
JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WEMADE A

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:53.189
NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.425
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AT FIRST WE

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.360
RECOMMENDED THE DH CS COMPLETE

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:58.595
ITS CURRENT EFFORTS TO MEASURE

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:00.263
MANAGED CARE PLANS PERFORMANCE

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.098
AND IMPOSE SANCTIONS OR PROVIDE

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:03.967
INCENTIVES AS APPROPRIATE.

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.368
ALTHOUGH DHC ESTATES THAT IT

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:06.503
HAS IMPLEMENTED AN INCENTIVE

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.038
PROGRAM TO DATE IT IS NOT

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:09.239
PROVIDED ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT

00:55:09.305 --> 00:55:11.141
IS MADE ANY LEAD TESTING

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.143
INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. SECOND WE

00:55:13.209 --> 00:55:15.145
ALSO COMMENDED AGAIN THAT

00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:16.246
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHO ARE

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.881
NOT PROVIDING REQUIRED TESTS BE

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:20.083
IDENTIFIED AND REMINDED OF THE

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.850
REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE THE

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.719
STATUS. THIS STRATEGY HAS

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:23.853
WORKED IN OTHER STATES AND

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.488
WOULD LIKELY HAVE AN IMMEDIATE

00:55:25.555 --> 00:55:25.955
EFFECT EFFECT HERE IN

00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:28.758
CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO OUR

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:30.060
REVIEW OF DHT S. WILL ALSO

00:55:30.126 --> 00:55:32.162
ASSESS THE EFFORT EFFORTS OF

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:33.363
THE CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:34.831
PREVENTION PROGRAM OVERSEEN BY

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:37.367
C. PH. WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:38.535
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:55:38.601 --> 00:55:40.470
EXPOSED TO LEAD. AND PROVIDING

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:42.539
CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.240
THOSE WHO HAVE LEAD POISONING.

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:46.376
OUT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER HOOPER

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:48.244
HAS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:51.614

JOSH COOPER I WAS THE LEAD ON

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:56.720
THIS AUDIT. BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.988
CITY PH IS DATA ON LEAD TEST

00:55:59.055 --> 00:56:02.158
RESULTS- AS YOU CAN SEE ON PAGE

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:03.927
FOUR OF OUR HAND OUT WE FOUND

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.295
THAT CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.230
HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:08.364
CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.966
LEVELS. WE'VE MADE THIS

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:11.267
AVAILABLE AS THE STATE AUDITOR

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:12.068
SAID ON AN INTERACTIVE

00:56:12.135 --> 00:56:13.870
DASHBOARD AWARE WE'VE NARROWED

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:16.372
IT DOWN BY CENSUS TRACT. AND BY

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:19.142
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT. OUT IN

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.143
SOME NEIGHBORHOODS AS YOU CAN

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:21.478
SEE IN THE PLOTS OF SACRAMENTO

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:22.979
COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY THEIR

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.414
SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:25.782
CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:28.051
LEVELS. AND WE HAVE A

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.419
RECOMMENDATION TO ADDRESS THAT

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:31.454
MEDICINE CITY PH IMMEDIATELY

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.123
COMPLETE AND PUBLICIZED AN

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:34.891
ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH RISK AREAS

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:38.361
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ALSO

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.896
FOUND THAT CITY PH COLLECTS

00:56:39.963 --> 00:56:41.331
DATA ON LED INSPECTIONS AN

00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:42.932
ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.667
RESIDENCES IN THE STATE. OF

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:45.702
THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.237
USEFUL TO POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.972
AND RENTERS. AND WE HAVE A

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:49.806
RECOMMENDATION TO THE

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:52.776
LEGISLATURE THAT- TO REQUIRE

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:54.110
CITY PH TO MAKE THIS

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.312
INFORMATION PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

00:56:56.379 --> 00:57:00.049
IN AN ONLINE REGISTRY. THE

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:01.384
REASON IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.652
THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:03.887
ABOUT WHERE THE RISKS TO

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:06.055
CHILDREN OR THE HIGHEST. IS

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:08.458
THAT A SO THAT SOMETHING CAN BE

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:10.293
DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS. ON

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.496
PAGE FIVE. WE HAVE WE LOOKED

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:15.131
SPECIFICALLY AT SOME OF THE

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.866
AREAS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.701
FOUND THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE

00:57:18.768 --> 00:57:20.537
YEARS. WE FOUND THREE HUNDRED

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.704
AND THIRTY EIGHT CHILDREN WITH

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.973
ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS LOCATED IN

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.109
JUST TEN APARTMENT COMPLEXES IN

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.478
THE COUNTY. SOME OF THESE

00:57:28.545 --> 00:57:29.813
COMPLEXES HAD DOZENS OF

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.881
CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.750
LEVELS AS THE GRAPHIC SHOWS.

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.218
THIS SUGGESTED CITY PH IS NOT

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:37.720
ADEQUATELY REDUCING RISKS IN

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:40.390
THOSE HIGH RISK AREAS- THAT IT

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:43.593
IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY. OR ITS

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.862
CURRENT APPROACH IS TO IT-

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:48.464
CONTRACT WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.567
CONDUCT OUTREACH AND EDUCATION.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.669
BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT THOSE

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.671
ARE THOSE IT IS NOT ABLE IT IS

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.706
CITY PH HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.875
DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT- APPROACH

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:00.510
HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. SO OUR

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:02.378
RECOMMENDATION IS THE CITY PH

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:03.246
TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.914
OF THAT APPROACH AND IF IT

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:06.583
DETERMINES THAT IT IS NOT

00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:09.385
SUFFICIENTLY. EFFECTIVE THAT IT

00:58:09.452 --> 00:58:12.222
SHOULD- REPLACE AUGMENT THAT

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:14.057
APPROACH WITH PROACTIVE

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.159
ABATEMENT OF LEAD RISKS IN THE

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:20.430
IN THE STATE. WE ALSO FOUND

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:22.932
THAT CITY PA TO SPEND- SHOWN

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:25.702
POOR MANAGEMENT OF THE CHILD

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.270
HAD LED PREVENTION PROGRAM.

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:29.339
PRIMARILY WE FOUND AS WE SHOW

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:31.207
ON PAGE SIX OF THE HAND OUT THE

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:32.542
CITY PAGES FAILED TO MEET A

00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:34.310
NUMBER OF STATUTORY

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:34.911
REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE DO LAST

00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.347
YEAR. THESE INCLUDE POSTING

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.048
INFORMATION ON THIS WEBSITE

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.917
ABOUT EFFORTS THAT IS TAKEN TO

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.886
REDUCE LEAD RISKS IN THE STATE.

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:45.088
AND COMPLETING OF. COMPLETING

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.222
AND PUBLICIZING A BI ANNUAL

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:49.158
NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:50.927
ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS THAT IS

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.730
RESPONSIBLE FOR. IN ADDITION

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:55.832
CITY PH IS NOT MET A STATUTORY

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.100
REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP THE

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:59.202
REGULATIONS HEALTH CARE

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.170
PROVIDERS ARE TO USE. IN

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.639
DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT TO

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:05.041
TEST A CHILD FOR ELEVATED LEAD

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:06.709
LEVELS WHEN THAT CHILD IS NOT

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:10.613
ON MEDICARE. WE GOING TO THIS

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:24.928
ON THE NEXT PAGE ON PAGE SEVEN.

00:59:24.994 --> 00:59:26.729
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.665
REGULATION REQUIRED HEALTHCARE

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:31.167
PROVIDERS TO USE JUSTA SINGLE

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.902
APPROACH TO DETERMINING WHETHER

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.971
OR NOT A CHILD SHOULD BE TESTED

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:36.739
FOR LEAD POISONING. THAT IS

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:38.274
WHETHER OR NOT THAT CHILD LIVES

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:40.410
IN OLDER HOUSING- THAT IS

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:42.145
CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REPAIRS OF

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:45.281
RENOVATIONS. WE LOOKED DURING

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:46.182
THE COURSE OF OUR AUDIT AT

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.884
INDIVIDUAL CASES OF ELEVATE

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.185
CHILDREN WITH ELEVATED LEAD

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.120
LEVELS AND FOUND A NUMBER OF

00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:52.622
CASES THAT WERE COSTS BY MORE

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:55.391
THAN JUST THIS SINGLE APPROACH.

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:56.893
OF FOR EXAMPLE WE FOUND CASES

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.761
WHERE A CHILD'S PARENTS WORKED

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.863
WITH LEAD AND THE PARENT WAS

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.365
BRINGING THAT- EXPOSURE HOME TO

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:06.436
THE CHILD. OR CASES- WHICH IS

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:07.370
BEEN MENTIONED- HERE ON THE

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.672
DESK THAT. WHERE CHILDREN WERE

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.075
EXPOSED TO LEAD THROUGH- THE

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:13.409
CANDIES THAT THEY EAT FROM

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:16.312
OTHER COUNTRIES. OR THROUGH-

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.650
TOYS OR OR HOME REMEDIES. OTHER

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:22.251
STATES INCORPORATE THOSE OTHER

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.187
RISK FACTORS IN THE REGULATIONS

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.956
USED TO DETERMINE RISK WHICH WE

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:27.890
SHOWING THE GRAPHIC ON PAGE

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:30.059
SEVEN. OUR RECOMMENDATION IS

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.527
THAT CALIFORNIA'S FINISHED THE

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.896
REQUESTED THE RECOMMEND THE

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.832
REGULATIONS THAT IT IS REQUIRED

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:37.400
TO DEVELOP AND INCORPORATE

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.968
THESE OTHERS SOME OTHER RISK

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.770
FACTORS. LIKE OTHER STATES DO

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:48.678
YOU. ON PAGE EIGHT WE GO ON TO

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.380
DISCUSS ANOTHER AREA WHERE CITY

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.948
PAGES DEMONSTRATED POOR

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:56.819
MANAGEMENT CITY PH HAS- NOT

01:00:56.886 --> 01:00:58.588
ADDRESS THE LACK OF INFORMATION

01:00:58.654 --> 01:01:00.890
THAT'S PROVIDED BY LABS WITH

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.392
TEST RESULTS AS WE SHOW IN THE

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.160
GRAPHIC. LABS SUBMIT TEST

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.728
RESULTS TO SEE PH IS CASE

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.063
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT WHEN

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.664
THOSE TEST RESULTS DON'T HAVE

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:09.399
ADEQUATE IDENTIFYING

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.601

THEM. BUREAUCRATIC IN NATURE-

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:25.968

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.936
OTHER ISSUE IS WE HANDED OUT AN

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.170
EXAMPLE OF CENSUS TRACK

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.638

YOU IN YOUR PRESENTATION THAT

01:06:23.612 --> 01:06:25.114
TO US SOME OF THE LOW RATE OF

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:27.216
TESTING IS SOMEWHAT CORRELATED

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:28.651
WITH THE LACK OF ACTUALLY

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.186
VISITS FOR RIGHT FOR THE CHECK

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:32.254
UPS. CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAKS FOR

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:34.924
THE- CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY DID

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:36.325
GET THEIR CHECK UPS IN OTHER

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:38.594
WORDS YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:39.995
OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOT TO LEAD

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:41.197
TESTING SO IN OTHER WORDS IS

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.798
OUR ISSUE THAT WE GOT ALL THE

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:44.700
KIDS WE SOMEHOW GOT AND WE WERE

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.869
WORKING WITH DTS ON THIS. GOT

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.170
ALL THE KIDS WE BUMPED UP THE

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.905
WELL CHILD GREAT TWO EIGHTY

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:53.242
PLUS 8590% IS THE LEAD TESTING

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.777
RATE GOING TO GO UP TO THE

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.445
PARALLEL YOU KNOW WITH THAT A

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:58.914
PRICE WILL GO UP SOMEWHAT OR DO

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.082
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OF TWELVE

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:00.683
ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.017
SEEN BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.153
GETTING THEIR LEFT TEST SO IT'S

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:05.755
ONE. WAIT FINDINGS WERE

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.889
REPORTING FOR THE KIDS WHO

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:09.191
ACTUALLY WERE SEEN IN TERMS OF

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:11.093
THE RATE OF LIKE TESTING SO. WE

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.662
WEREN'T WE WEREN'T PASSED WITH

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.765
COORDINATING BETWEEN THE TO SEE

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:20.403
WHAT IT SAID HOW- WE DO HAVE.

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.837
BY AND- A PERFORM MEASURE THC

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:25.474
WILL RAISE THE- THE- TESTING

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.943
RATE FOR LEAD LEAD OKAY. SO AND

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.745
THIS IS. VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.814
SAME- TO THE RIVER THE

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.082
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAD IN

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.984
THAT THE PREVIOUS OFFICE. AUDIT

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:36.385
THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING. SO

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:37.853
SYSTEMS SO BASICALLY YOU DON'T

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.121
HAVE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:40.055
THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE AUDITS AND

01:07:40.122 --> 01:07:41.824
THEY WERE LOOKING. PERHAPS YOU

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.626
SEPARATE DATABASES BUT WHAT I

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:44.894
CLEARLY ON SOLUTIONS I MEAN WE

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.095
CAN LOOK AT WRITING DIFFERENT

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:47.363
THINGS. WELL THEN THE SECOND

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.165
THING IS ACTUALLY YOU TALKED

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.834
ABOUT THE RISK FACTORS SO I

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.836
KNOW AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND I.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:54.637
TAKE YOUR MEDI CAL PATIENTS

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.305
THAT- SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.741
THAT- NOW WE DO RIGHT NOW I

01:07:58.808 --> 01:07:59.708
HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.010
ACTUALLY DO TEST EVERY CHILD

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:04.580
THAT ONE AND- TWO YEARS OF AGE-

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.683
USE OF. THIS A RISK FACTOR. IS

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.285
THAT TO DECIDE WHERE TO DO

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:10.953
SUBSEQUENT TESTING IS THAT WHAT

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.855
YOU'RE SUGGESTING ARE. HOUSE

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.356
YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER STATES

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.925
ARE USING IT SO SOME PEOPLE OF

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.526
USES AND- WAITED SIDE WHETHER

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.328
YOU NEED. TO FIRST BASE NOT

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.696
RAISE YOUR HIGH RISK WE TESTING

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.098
YOU'RE NOT. BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:26.802
YOU KNOW THAT. SAYS LIKE. IS

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:29.438

SPEAK TO HAVE OTHER STATES HAVE

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:06.242
USED THEIR RISK FACTOR- VERSUS-

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.143
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.277
CALIFORNIA. SHORT THAT'S AN

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:11.413
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND SO- AS

CHILDREN AGES ONE AND TWO. IF

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.121
THEY'RE IN A CAL OR RECEIVING-

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:22.525
ANOTHER OF BENEFIT FOR LOW

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:22.992
INCOME CHILDREN. THE

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:25.194
REQUIREMENTS PAGE SEVEN IS A

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:26.896
REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO

CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN THOSE

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:32.601
PROGRAMS. SO IF IN ORDER TO. IN

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:33.869
ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:35.571
NOT A CHILD IS AT RISK THE

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.907
FIRST- FACTOR THE U. CONSIDERS

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.308
IS A CHILD IN THAT THAT THAT

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.176
PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.678
SECOND WOULD BE THE RISK

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.512
FACTORS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:45.314
REGULATION AND RIGHT NOW IT'S

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.149
JUST THAT SINGLE RISK FACTOR.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.751
ABOUT DOES A CHILD LIVE IN OR

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:51.887
SPEND TIME. IN OLDER HOUSING.

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:55.424
OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY.

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:56.458
BECAUSE HE'S IS YOU MENTIONED

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.160
YOU'RE READY AND MEDI CAL AND I

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.461
THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT SO ARE

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:00.663
YOU LOOKING JUST AT MEDI CAL

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:01.997
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS ARE

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.499
YOU LOOKING A PRIVATE INSURANCE

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:06.602
AS WELL. SO THE RISK FACTORS ON

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.070
PAGE SEVEN APPLIED ONLY TO

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.505
CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN MEDI

01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:11.307
CAL. OKAY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:13.042
TO NOTE THAT PARENTS CAN REFUSE

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:17.446
THESE TESTS YES RIGHT. OKAY SO

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.381
IF I COULD ADD DOCTOR PAN SO

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:21.116
THE STATISTICS THAT WE HAVE AS

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:22.585
FAR AS WE WERE SPECIFICALLY

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:23.852
ASKED TO LOOK AT CHILDREN IN

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:25.588
MEDI CAL SO OF THAT NOT THE

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:26.922
NINE YEAR WINDOW. THERE WERE

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.490
TWO PONT NINE MILLION KIDS WHO

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.926
WERE ELIGIBLE AT AGED AGES ONE

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.962
AND TWO TO BE TESTED WHAT SOUND

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.997
AND YOU SAW IN THE PACKET IS.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.865
THERE'S YOU KNOW CLOSE TO TWO

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:37.766
MILLION OF THOSE CHILDREN THAT

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.202
DID NOT RECEIVE BOTH OR OR ONE

01:10:40.269 --> 01:10:41.870
OF THE TESTS THE REASON WE

01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:43.872
THINK THIS- ADDING THESE

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:44.807
ADDITIONAL FACTORS IN THE

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.675
REGULATIONS IS YOU'RE STILL

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.177
GOING TO INFORM THIS WILL

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.646
INFORM PROVIDERS. TO NOT JUST

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.181
ASK ABOUT THE ONE RISK FACTOR

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.882
FOR A METAL CAL CHAU CHILD WHO

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:55.684
IS A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY THERE

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:56.752
ARE OTHER FACTORS YOU SHOULD

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.253
CONSIDER FOR THAT CHILD BUT

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.588
THEN FOR THOSE PROVIDERS WHO

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.457
SEE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT IN

01:11:01.523 --> 01:11:03.592
MEDI CAL. THIS WOULD BE

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:05.928
INFORMATIVE TO THEM IT IS A

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:08.530
CHILD THAT PERHAPS IS EXPOSED

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.632
TO ONE THESE ONE OF THESE OTHER

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.800
RISK FACTORS THAT MAKE MAKE.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:15.304
PROVIDER DECIDE WE NEED TO TEST

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:16.939
THE CHILD EVEN THOUGH THE

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:17.539
CHILD'S NOT A MEDIC WELL IT'S

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.041
NOT BANNED THAT THAT CHILD

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:22.211
TESTED THIS. THIS WOULD BE USED

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:25.414
FOR BOTH AND IT WOULD BURKE AND

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:27.516
SHIP IN WHO ARE NOT PART OF CAL

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:32.287
SO WE WOULD. FACTORS YOU'RE

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:35.324
GOING TO PENSION TEST CHILL WHO

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.425
ARE NOT IN MAY CAL MAY BE AT

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.427
RISK OF EXPOSURE LEAD POISONING

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:39.528
I HOPE THAT HELP TO ALL RIGHT I

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:42.698
KNOW THAT THAT'S HELPFUL- YEAH

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.500
AND I DON'T CALL TOUGH TALK MY

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:45.601
HEAD I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.603
BACK AT SO IF YOU SHEET THESE

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:48.937
ITEMS I DON'T OF ALL THESE

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:51.006
ITEMS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.141
RECOMMENDED BY A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:54.076
YOU KNOW- SCIENTIFIC BODIES OF

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.079
LOOK AT ACTUAL RISK FACTORS-

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.647
CERTAINLY LET IS EXTREMELY

01:11:58.714 --> 01:11:59.682
SERIOUS SO WE WANT TO DO WHAT

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:02.651
WE CAN TO SCREEN LEAD. I ALSO

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.620
JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:07.690
AND- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:08.957
PEOPLE WANT US TO SCREEN FOR

LISTED TO CHECK OFF ANY

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:18.133
QUESTIONS THEY HAVE THE ANSWER

IT'S AT AROUND- WE HAVE TO I

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.438
JUST WANNA BE CONSCIOUS OF THAT

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:27.910
OTHER SIDE THAT BURDEN.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:28.844
OBVIOUSLY THAT IS. IT'S SO

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:31.213

LATER WITH WHAT THE EVIDENCE

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.050
SHOWS INTO OF WHAT ARE THE

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.085
HIGHEST. YEAH THE QUESTIONS

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.186
THAT HAVE THAT ACTUALLY MAKE A

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.755
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. SCREEN

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:41.790
FOR LEAD TOXICITY. AS SOMEONE

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:43.392
WHO ACTUALLY USED TO PRACTICE

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:44.626
IN THE AREA OF WHEN I WAS A

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:47.463
TRAINING AT WHICH HAD A LOT OF

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:49.431
LET HOUSING. SO THANKS RIGHT

THE REPORT IN THE INTRODUCTION

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.270
WE LOOKED AT WHAT CDC RAT OUT

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.306
THERE. AS FAR AS GUIDANCE AND

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:58.607
ALSO OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:01.276
HEALTH AND WE USE THAT GUIDANCE

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.711
TO DETERMINE WHAT. SHOULD

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.413
POTENTIALLY BE OTHER RISK

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.415
FACTORS TO US ASSESS AND THAT'S

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.549
WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT OTHER

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:09.318
STATES WERE DOING SO WE DID

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:11.186
RELIANCE ON RESEARCH THAT'S OUT

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.388

DATA AND THOSE HOT SPOT. RIGHT

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:20.195
AND I BELIEVE ASSEMBLYMAN

GARCIA- THIS WAS ASSEMBLY BILL

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:23.766
TWENTY TO SEVENTY NINE.

01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:25.134
IDENTIFIES AS THINGS DIVIDE.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.668
THAT SUPPLIED WITH THAT WE'RE

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:28.804
GONNA MOVE TO SENATOR DOLLIES

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:31.173

SO ON ON PAG SEVEN I HAVE

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:38.814
ACTUALLY TWO QUESTIONS. IN NEW

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:44.219
YORK DAVE CHAPPELLE WALK THIS.

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:45.020
AND WE CHECK ONE BOX. SO WHAT

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.388
IT WILL ARE THEY FIND WE DO DO

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:47.823
WE ARE ANY OF. FOR ME AND WHAT

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.358
WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE AND

01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:51.794
WHO WHO THEY'RE ALL HITTING. IN

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.061
THEIR TEST AND I DIDN'T GET A

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:54.897
CHANCE TO. GO THROUGH THE

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.431
PAMPHLET THAT UNIT OUT SO IF

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.533
IT'S IN THERE I BY ME AND MR

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:59.802
BUT I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION.

01:13:59.868 --> 01:14:02.437
SO WE LOOK AT- WE LOOK AT WHAT

01:14:02.504 --> 01:14:03.005
OTHER STATES WERE USING IN

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:06.108
THEIR- LEAD QUESTIONNAIRE- WE

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.643
LOOKED AT THEIR TESTING RATES.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:08.977
OTHER THAN THAT WE DIDN'T GO

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:12.047
IN- VERY DEEPLY INTO- THE DATA

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.816
THAT OTHER STATES MAYOR OR MAY

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.784
NOT HAVE OUR OUR- OUR AUTO.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.886
FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:18.654
KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF OUR

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:21.757
TESTING RATE THAN CALIFORNIA-

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:24.293
WE ALSO KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH NEW

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.594
YORK HAS TESTED HAS CHECKED ALL

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.963
OF THE BOXES. THERE MAY BE.

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.698
OTHER AREAS. THAT WE DIDN'T

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:31.567
INCLUDE IT THIS LOOKS THAT THAT

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:32.501
THEY COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AND

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:34.570
FOR YOU KNOW WHIPS. DEMOGRAPHIC

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.371
THEY WERE. WITH IT REALLY

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:40.342
FOCUSED ON WANTED TO YOUR WITH

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.543
A FOCUSED ON. THE UNDERSERVED.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:42.778
COMMUNITIES I MEAN I KNOW THAT

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:43.378
IT FROM NEARLY POSITIVE BUT

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:44.279
IT'S ALSO WANTED TWO YEAR OLDS

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:46.281
IN NEW YORK. OKAY MY SECOND

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.917
QUESTION IS ON THE NEXT PAGE

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:52.654
YOU HAVE. THIS VERY. STARTLING

01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.289
TO ME THAT IT WOULD TAKE A

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.123
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO YEARS TO GET

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:56.959
THE BACKLOG OF TESTS THAT ARE.

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:58.594
OUT THERE SO CAN YOU ELABORATE

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.563
MAYBE ON WHY THAT IS AND IS IT

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.332
A LACK OF FUNDING IS IT. I MEAN

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:04.533
I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.168
DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD TO HAVE A

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.603
TEST IF YOU CAN'T CONNECT

01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:09.104
ANALYZE IT AND DO SOMETHING

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.773
WITH IT. RIGHT AND THIS THE

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.808
YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THIS IS WHAT

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.076
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THE

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:19.514
LEGISLATURE'S CITY PH HAD. THE

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:20.349
PROBLEM HERE IS A LACK OF

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:21.850
INFORMATION WITH THESE LEAD

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:24.920
TEST RESULTS. AND THE- WHEN THE

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.421
LABS ART REQUIRE AREN'T

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:28.290
REPORTING FULL. CLEAR

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.292
IDENTIFICATION ARE ENDED

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.160
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WITH

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.629
THOSE LAB TEST RESULTS CITY

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.398
PAGES DATA SYSTEM. CAN'T

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.433
AUTOMATICALLY PROCESS THAT

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.835
WHICH MEANS THE LOCAL AGENCIES

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:42.404
AREN'T ABLE TO IDENTIFY OKAY

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.405
HERE'S THAT THE LEAD TEST

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:45.307
RESULT. WAS LOOKING FOR- THIS

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.409
WHAT I NEEDED TO HELP OUT THIS

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.444
SPECIFIC CHILD. SO THERE ARE A

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.579
NUMBER OF PIECES TO THAT

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:53.081
PUZZLE- AND SO OUR

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.082
RECOMMENDATION ADDRESSES THE

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:57.552
VERY FIRST PIECE- AND I CAN'T

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.087
GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:02.758
WHETHER OR NOT. THERE'S THE IF

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:03.892
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I WOULD

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:05.460
SPECIFICALLY TARGET TO C. PH ON

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:09.064
THIS ISSUE. WELL AS YOU KNOW

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:13.168
OUR- JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:14.870
THE SHORTCOMINGSARE AND THEN

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:15.771
TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:18.907
TYPICALLY I WOULD SAY 99% OF

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:19.808
THE PEOPLE AT LEAST VISIT MY

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.643
OFFICE ALWAYS NEED MORE

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.912
RESOURCES TO GET WHATEVER IT IS

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:25.180
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET DONE DONE.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.581
AND I ALWAYS COME BACK WITH

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.717
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT. ALWAYS THE

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:30.385
RESOURCES AVAILABLE IT'S

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:31.720
SOMETIMES OUR POLICIES IN THIS

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:33.488
BUT IN THIS CASE I'M CONCERNED

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.257
THAT MAYBE OUR POLICIES IN

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.726
RESOURCES ARE A LINE BECAUSE- I

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:41.363
KNOW THAT. WE HAVE IN AREAS

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.198
THAT WE KNOW WE HAD HOT SPOTS

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.100
AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.802
I WORKED I WAS INNOCENTLY ON A

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:48.704
BILL TO. ADDRESS WHAT WE HAD IT

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.472
EXCITED BECAUSE WE KNEW THERE

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:54.076
WAS A THE- PROBLEM THERE BUT

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.177

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.945
INFORMATION TO MAKE GOOD

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:57.446
DECISIONS SO IT WOULD BE

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.414
HELPFUL. I THINK IF I COULD

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:00.282
JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.985
QUESTION. CENTER DOLLY ASKED WE

TEST AT SUCH A HIGHER LEVEL TO

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:24.473

WHERE WHERE'S THE FAILURE. I

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:34.876
WAS AT DIFFICULT. THAT SOUNDS

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:38.080
LIKE A GOOD QUESTION FOR THE

01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:40.882
OTHER AGENCIES I THINK THAT WE

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.584
COULD DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.352
BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:48.156
THAT WE HAD WHERE THESE ARE

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:50.959
MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY'RE

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.260

RIGHT A PREVENTATIVE SERVICES-

01:18:55.630 --> 01:19:00.135
AND PART OF PREVENTIVE CARE IS-

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.870
PROVIDING THESE TESTS FOR

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.305

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:07.209
WHERE WE SAW THE PROBLEM IS TO.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.212
THOSE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO

MAKE SURE THOSE PLANS ARE

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:13.682
ENSURING THAT THOSE PROVIDERS

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.050
ARE FIGHTING ALL OF THE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.652
SERVICES THAT. CHILDREN MEDI

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.535
MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.004
THIS INFORMATION. BECAUSE THE

LACK. PORT ST OUT FOR THAT THE

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:39.407
MANAGED PLANS ARE ON TOP OF THE

WE NEED TO HAVE AN AT ITS OF

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:51.987
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

SURE THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED IN

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:01.096
THIS IS PART OF WHAT WE

01:20:01.163 --> 01:20:02.297
RECOMMENDED IN OUR PREVIOUS

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:04.299
AUDIT. THAT THERE ARE VERY

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.568
SPECIFIC SERVICES THAT MEDI CAL

HOLD THE MANAGED CARE PLANS

01:20:16.711 --> 01:20:17.679
ACCOUNTABLE WHICH WILL

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.514

ADOLESCENCE DUE TO BEHAVIOR DID

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:07.435
OF EVER ISSUES. SO WE TAKE THIS

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:10.705
VERY SERIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT THE

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:13.141
AUDIT RESULTS IN THE AMOUNT OF

TESTING THAT'S OCCURRING IS

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.610
UNACCEPTABLE. THERE'S SOME GOOD

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:18.179
NEWS AT THE LEVEL OF POSITIVE

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.214
TESTING IS GOING DOWN. BUT IF

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.382

TURNS OVER IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:30.525
THAT THERE ARE MORE RISKS THAN

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:34.695
JUST HOUSING STOCK- BUT- YOU

RUN SCHEDULE WILL TALK ABOUT

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.185
ONE ITEM THAT- BECAUSE OF

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.252

THE RESPECTIVE CRITERIA AND A

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:43.270
LITTLE BIT TO ANSWER SOME OF

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:45.238
THE QUESTIONS CURRENTLY AS WE

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.140

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WEEK

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:12.733
WITH EXPLORING MORE HOPING TO

01:46:12.799 --> 01:46:17.904
ACT BE DOING A FORMAL OF ONLY

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:22.342
PROCESS THE FALL OF MANY MANY

REGULAR STILL THEY USUALLY

01:46:29.649 --> 01:46:30.917
TAKES TWO THREE YEARS DEPENDING

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:35.055
ON THEN THE REGULATION. KIND OF

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:39.559
TRY IN ADDITION WE ARE. IN THE-

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:41.528
WE DID IT UP IN THE OF TWO

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.063
NINETY THE STAND OF CARE

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.297
GUIDELINES FOR PROVIDER. WE

01:46:44.364 --> 01:46:46.032
ACTUALLY POSTED ON A WEB AND

AUGUST. THAT ALSO WAS PUBLIC ON.

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:51.838
ON THE MEDICAL OR NEWS THAT THE

UNDER. WHAT THEY NEED TO AS A

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:04.851
PERTAINS TEST. I'M JUST TO HELP

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:10.791
IN OF LOW POISONING IN AND HE

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:14.194
REMINDED AND ABOUT THEM TO.

01:47:14.261 --> 01:47:22.335
RETEST THESE KIDS. THANKS FOR

THE TESTIMONY- LET ME JUST.

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.775
FIRST TASK JUST VERY POINTEDLY-

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.243
SHOULD WE ACTUALLY QUESTIONS

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:31.244
ARISE FROM THE LAST PANEL BUT

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:32.445
YOU KNOW A LOT OF US WERE

01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:33.814
DISAPPOINTED AND DISMAYED WHEN

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:35.215
WE LEARNED THAT ONE POINT FOUR

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.284
MILLION CHILDREN. I HAVE NOT

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:38.785
BEEN TESTED SO IF I CAN ASK

01:47:38.852 --> 01:47:40.153
JUST VERY DIRECTLY WHY DIDN'T

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.656
THIS OCCUR- FROM YOUR

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:45.091
PERSPECTIVE AND THEN SECONDLY

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.693
FOR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:47.527
YOU KNOW THE STATE AUDITOR

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:50.130
PROVIDED US ALL INFORMATION

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:51.832
WITH. THE DATABASE TO FIND ALL

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:53.200
THE HOT SPOT WHY WAS THIS NOT

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.601
PROVIDED WHY WAS THIS NOT DONE

01:47:54.668 --> 01:47:56.603
BY CITY PH THESE ARE QUESTIONS

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:59.573
KERRY FROM PREVIOUS PANEL.

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.408
PLEASE I THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:02.509
ANSWER BUT I THINK THERE'S

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:04.611
REALLY THREE DIFFERENT PARTS TO

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.847
IT. AND IT'S ABOUT ALIGNING

01:48:06.913 --> 01:48:07.581
BETWEEN ALL THE PARTS OF THE

01:48:07.647 --> 01:48:10.550
SYSTEM. SO ONE IS YOU'VE GOT TO

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:11.918
GET INDIVIDUALS AND WE'VE GOT

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:13.420
TO GET CHILDREN IN FORTHEIR

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:14.654
FOR THEIR WELL JOHN PREVENTIVE

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:17.824
VISITS AND THEN. MY CONCERN IS.

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.759
IN ONE SEE EVEN IF THEY COME IN

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:20.760
FOR THOSE PREVENTIVE VISITS DO

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:23.630
THEY DO THE LEAD. SO YOU TO PUT.

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:24.464
THEY DON'T COME IN WHEN THEY

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:25.232
COME IN IF YOU DON'T DO THE

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:27.601
TEST SO THEY'LL BE ONE PIECE.

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:29.302
AND I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:32.639
THINGS RELATED TO THAT. IS NO

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:35.141
MORE A VERY GOOD AT THE CLOSE

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.176
WE PAY FOR. THINGS THAT YOU

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:39.246
KNOW. IN THEORY SHOULD BE DONE.

01:48:39.312 --> 01:48:41.481
I ALSO THINK THAT MONEY MAKES A

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:42.949
DIFFERENCE AND SO I THINK WHEN

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:45.318
WE THINK ABOUT INCENTIVES. FOR

01:48:45.385 --> 01:48:47.854
PROVIDERS HAVING FOCUSED

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:49.489
INCENTIVES THAT MAKE THEM THINK

01:48:49.556 --> 01:48:52.259
ABOUT A PARTICULAR THING LIKE

01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:53.560
SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS LEAD

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:55.528
TESTING FOR CHILDREN. I THINK

01:48:55.595 --> 01:48:56.696
THAT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE IT

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:59.666
FOCUSES ATTENTION. AND WE'VE

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:01.568
SEEN HALTH PLANS DO THAT. IN

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.203
DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:06.573
BAD AND HELPFUL SO THAT'S ONE.

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.241
THING I'M HEALTH PLAN WELL. I

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:09.676
THINK IT'S BEEN MOSTLY A DATA

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:12.045
PROBLEM IT IS COMPLICATED

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:12.879
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT CLOUT IT'S

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:15.015
GOING UP TO SEE PHD. YOU'VE GOT

01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:17.350
SOME INFORMATION COMING BACK

01:49:17.417 --> 01:49:18.852
THE PLANS BUT NOT THIS IS THE

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.487
TEST RESULTS THEMSELVES THAT'S

01:49:20.553 --> 01:49:21.655
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:23.556
THEN YOU KNOW IN YOUR PRACTICE

01:49:23.623 --> 01:49:25.558
pYOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT AWAY FOR

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:27.894
THE PLAN TO HELP YOU SAY.

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:28.428
HERE'S WHERE THE KIDS ARE

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:29.629
COMING FROM WHERE YOU'RE REALLY

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:32.032
CONCERNED ABOUT RISK AND TO YOU

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.600
KNOW HOW YOU DOING OVERALL IN

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.969
TERMS YOUR TEST. SO THERE'S

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:37.837
REALLY A DEBT PROBLEM AND I

01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:39.306
THINK OF THE DEPARTMENT LOCAL-

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:41.675
NO SPEAKING NOT FOR THE

01:49:41.741 --> 01:49:42.842
APARTMENT TIME BECAUSE OF THE

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:45.445
JOB FOR TWO WEEKS AND ONE DAY.

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:48.214
YOU KNOW THAT THAT FOCUS THAT.

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:49.316
ALL THE WAY DOWN FROM THE

01:49:49.382 --> 01:49:51.484
DEPARTMENT TO THE PLANTS INTO

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:53.219
THE PROVIDERS HAS NOT BEEN AS

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.087
STRONG AS IT SHOULD BE BOTH

01:49:54.154 --> 01:49:56.756
FROM A DATA PERSPECTIVE. THE

01:49:56.823 --> 01:49:58.959
INFORMATION. AND I'M A BELIEVER

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:00.994
IN INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES I'M

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:02.996
A BELIEVER IN THEM. SO I THINK

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:05.332
THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW AS WE

01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:07.000
PRESENT TO. GET THE DATA GET IT

01:50:07.067 --> 01:50:09.903
BY MANAGED CARE AND HOLD THEM

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:10.870
ACCOUNTABLE FROM A FROM A

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.639
PENALTY OF YOU AT THAT LEVEL.

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:13.873
PROVIDE THE INCENTIVES THE

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.142
PHYSICIANS. TO MAKE SURE

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:18.345
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AND

01:50:18.411 --> 01:50:19.412
DOING THIS EVERY THEY HAVE THE

01:50:19.479 --> 01:50:20.580
OPPORTUNITY IT UP WHEN YOU

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:22.282
CLOSE TO ONE YEAR CLOSE. YOUR

01:50:22.349 --> 01:50:23.583
VOTE. TO ME THOSE ARE THE IS

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:26.419
THAT WEREN'T THERE. AND SO. YOU

01:50:26.486 --> 01:50:30.090
KNOW. CAN I SAY WHY NOT- BUT I

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.791
CAN SAY THAT I THINK THE THINGS

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:33.059
THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:34.894
NOT TRY TO DO THE THINGS WE'RE

01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:36.029
GOING TO DO WILL MAKE A

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:37.430
DIFFERENCE OKAY BUT IT WILL

01:50:37.497 --> 01:50:38.932
TAKE TIME AND I APPRECIATE THAT

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.134
VERY DIRECT RESPONSE BUT- I

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:44.371
WOULD ASK. YOU HAVE. WHEN YOU

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:45.905
TALK ABOUT INCENTIVES YOU'RE

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:48.208
TALKING ABOUT PENALTIES. WHEN

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.509
YOU CONTRACT OUT WITH MANAGE

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:52.746
HEALTHCARE PLANS DON'T YOU HAVE

01:50:52.812 --> 01:50:54.347
THEY ARE MAKING SURE THAT THESE

01:50:54.414 --> 01:50:57.417
TESTS ARE DONE. YES THERE'S TWO

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:59.452
PIECES IN ONE IS WE'VE NOT DONE

01:50:59.519 --> 01:51:00.387
THE MEASUREMENTS YOU KNOW

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:01.688
THERE'S NOT BEEN. THAT

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:02.956
PARTICULAR MEASURE THE HE JUST

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:05.058
MEASURE AND THEN THE SPECIAL

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.292
MEASURE WE'RE GONNA DO TO HAVE

01:51:06.359 --> 01:51:07.861
ONE YEAR OLDS. HAVE NOT HAVE

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:09.462
NOT BEEN THAT'S NOT BEEN

01:51:09.529 --> 01:51:09.929
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:12.465
COLLECTED- THERE'S BEEN MANY

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:13.666
OTHER MEASURES AS YOU KNOW

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:15.535
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCOUNTABILITY

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:16.603
AT. ABOUT A CERTAIN SET A

01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:18.471
MEASURE. UP APARTMENT IS NOW

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:20.640
GROSSLY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:23.777
THE NUMBER OF THOSE THOSE- TO

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:28.681
THOSE STUDY. BE DONE- AND THEY

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:31.384
RAISE THE PERFORMANCE LEVEL TO

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:34.020
A- WAS. THAT IT. YOU YOU KNOW

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:34.854
MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THAT

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.823
DATA FROM THE HEALTH PLANS SO

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:37.791
WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.927
AND I DON'T KNOW J. C. THANK

01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:42.128
YOU AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU

01:51:42.195 --> 01:51:43.063
SEE A NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.864
PROPOSALS AIMED AT HOW DO WE

01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:45.932
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF.

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:47.634
CHILDREN BEING TESTED SO THAT

01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:48.334
WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.537
EXACTLY HELP THESE FOLKS.

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:51.838
ESPECIALLY IN THE- THE HOT SPOT

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.406
AREAS AND WE ASKED BERMAN

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:54.941
PUBLIC HEALTH ON. THE DATA

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:56.376
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.178
BROUGHT UP TO AS A- AS AN

01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.480
ISSUE. PLEASE YEAH AS I

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:03.383
MENTIONED EARLIER ARE. YOU KNOW

01:52:03.450 --> 01:52:04.484
OUR KEY STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW IS.

01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:07.921
OUR OUR DATE. CONTINUOUS MAN SO

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:09.322
I THINK THE AUDITOR'S MENTIONED

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:12.659
THAT ABOUT 10% OF OUR- DATA

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:13.660
STILL HAS TO BE MANUALLY

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:16.129
PROCESSED IN ADDITION. WHICH

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.597
MEANS WE HAVE TO DO A LOT OF

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:18.398

THOROUGH AUDIT. VERY EYE

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:37.282
OPENING VERY ENLIGHTENING. SO

02:07:37.349 --> 02:07:40.119
WE KNOW IT IS A FACT THAT SINCE

02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:40.719
NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN LET HAS

02:07:40.786 --> 02:07:41.153
BEEN KNOWN TO CAUSE

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.489
REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGE AND- BIRTH

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.657
DEFECTS. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

02:07:45.724 --> 02:07:46.892
TWO WE KNOW THAT LED CAUSES

02:07:46.959 --> 02:07:49.294
CANCER. AND IN THE LITTLE

02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:51.263
EXAMPLE HERE OF BLOOD LEVELS

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:52.664
WHICH IS VERY EASY FOR SOMEONE

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:54.166
LIKE ME WHO'S NOT A DOCTOR TO

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:56.802
READ. THE VERY LOWEST LEAD IN

02:07:56.869 --> 02:07:58.604
EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN IN THEIR

02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:00.539
BLOOD CAUSES DAMAGE HEARING.

02:08:00.606 --> 02:08:02.574
BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS AND JUST

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:04.410
DECREASED IQ LEVEL SO IT IS

02:08:04.476 --> 02:08:07.212
ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE TO ME

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:09.148
THAT WE ARE SITTING HERE TODAY

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:11.183
IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND WE ARE

02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:13.685
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:16.655
TEST CHILL AND- YEAH WE- BEEN

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:20.192
ARM VULNERABLE COMMUTE. I

02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:20.893
APPRECIATE ALLOF YOU HAVE SAID

02:08:20.959 --> 02:08:21.527
THAT YOU TO THIS VERY SERIOUSLY

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:22.828
BUCKLEY SOMEONE WAS TAKING A

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.496
VERY SERIOUSLY FOR ALMOSTA

02:08:24.563 --> 02:08:27.366
DECADE- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:29.068
AUDITOR'S KEY FINDINGS. DH DS

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:31.570
DID NOT INSURE OVER A NINE YEAR

02:08:31.637 --> 02:08:32.771
PERIOD MILLIONS OF CHILDREN

02:08:32.838 --> 02:08:34.373
ENROLLED IN MEDICARE SEE ALL

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:36.141
THE LEAD TEST THAT THEY SHOULD.

02:08:36.208 --> 02:08:38.177
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAD-

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.678
HAD LEAD POISONING AND REQUIRE

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:41.814
TREATMENT WHY HOW DOES THAT

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:43.449
HAPPEN OVER ALMOST A DECADE. I

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:46.518
UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR NEW DOCTOR

02:08:46.585 --> 02:08:51.924
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. THERE WAS

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.625
A FAILURE ON MANY LEVELS AND I

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:56.595
THINK THE FAILURE WAS A

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:57.162
COMBINATION LIKE I MENTIONED

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:59.932
BEFORE OF. NOT HAVING WORDING

02:08:59.998 --> 02:09:01.767
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SAY THIS

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:03.335
PLANS DOING OKAY ABOUT PLANS

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:05.170
NOT DOING OKAY THIS DOCTORS NOT

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:06.505
DOING AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:07.973
PURSES THIS DOCTOR BECAUSE

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.141
THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY YOU

02:09:09.208 --> 02:09:11.110
FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOLD PEOPLE

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:12.211
ACCOUNTABLE AS YOU KNOW WHERE

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:13.479
THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE NOT

02:09:13.545 --> 02:09:15.214
UNIVERSE I MEAN THERE ARE

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.915
POSITIONS THAT ARE VERY

02:09:16.982 --> 02:09:18.750
ORGANIZED TEARS UP TO DO THE

02:09:18.817 --> 02:09:19.751
WELL CHILD THEY REALLY HARD

02:09:19.818 --> 02:09:21.286
IT'S ABOUT THE DO THE TESTING.

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:22.788
AND THERE'S OTHER PHYSICIANS

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:24.223
NOT AS MUCH BUT IF YOU HAVE THE

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:26.024
DATA WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY

02:09:26.091 --> 02:09:28.660
TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS IT

02:09:28.727 --> 02:09:30.863
MAKES IT HARD CHECKS IN TEXAN

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:33.799
MAKE SURE THAT THE DATE THERE

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:39.505
FIND IT AT. WAIT ANOTHER DESK.

02:09:39.571 --> 02:09:40.506
I'M NOT IT'S I THINK IT'S TO

02:09:40.572 --> 02:09:42.407
ONE IS THE DATE IS FRAGMENT SO

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:44.209
THE TEST RESULTS GO TO CITY PH

02:09:44.276 --> 02:09:46.845
THE ACTUAL LEVELS THE PLAN GET

02:09:46.912 --> 02:09:48.547
SOME RESULTS THE TEST HAS BEEN

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:50.082
DONE BUT REALLY YOU NEED THE

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:51.550
LEVELS SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.051
HEARING TODAY IS WE'VE GOT TO

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:54.486
FIGURE OUT HOW THAT ALL COMES

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:56.421
TOGETHER NOT ONLY COULD GATHER

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:59.158
BUT HAS A FIRE THE FACT THAT

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:00.292
THERE SEVEN THOUSAND. AS THE

02:10:00.359 --> 02:10:02.494
DOOR OF DEAD OF THEM SEE AN

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:04.163
ATTACHED THAT TO A CHILD MAKES

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:06.265
IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO THEN SAY

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:08.333
ALL RIGHT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:11.470
THAT CHART WHERE WAS THE CHILD

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:13.005
WHO IS THE POSITION AND WHAT

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:15.974
HEALTH CLUB WITH A- IF YOU. ARE

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:16.675
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. LAB

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:18.043
REPORTING WITHOUT A IDENTIFY.

02:10:18.110 --> 02:10:20.212
WE ARE US. SO I THINK IT'S THAT.

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:22.514
OF GETTING THE DATA IT'S ALSO.

02:10:22.581 --> 02:10:23.949
YOU KNOW HAVING THE REPORTING

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:26.418
UP TO THE STATE TO THE STAKE IN

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:28.253
ALL THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. SO

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.721
THE FAILURE ON MANY LEVELS. SO

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:32.391
IF THE AUDIT HAD NOT BEEN DONE

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:34.359
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE

02:10:34.426 --> 02:10:34.893
DISCOVERED THAT THIS WAS A

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.164
PROBLEM. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:40.465
THE BIGGER QUESTION FIGURE

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:41.800
CLOCK ARE WE MONITORING

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:44.136
OURSELVES AND ARE WE MAKING

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:46.271
SURE WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS. SO

02:10:46.338 --> 02:10:48.340
AT THIS CHEESY COOPER- I THINK

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:50.442
THAT- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:51.710
RECENT CONVERSATIONS IN LIGHT

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:53.212
OF BOTH THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:54.680
AUDIT AS WELL AS THE BLOOD THAT

02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:56.114
SCREENING IN REGARDS TO THE

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:57.349
DEPARTMENT TAKING A STEP BACK

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.084
AND THINKING ABOUT HOW ARE WE

02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:01.019
MONITORING OUR MANAGED CARE

02:11:01.086 --> 02:11:02.287
PLANS. ON WHO THEN WE HOLD

02:11:02.354 --> 02:11:03.655
RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITOR OUR

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.490
PROVIDERS TO DO WHATEVER IS IN

02:11:05.557 --> 02:11:07.292
OUR CONTRACT AS DOCTOR GILBERT

02:11:07.359 --> 02:11:08.660
WAS MENTORING THERE'S MANY

02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:10.996
LAYERS OF HOW WE APPROACH THIS

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:11.964
AS WELL AS ARMING

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:14.233
BENEFICIARIES- AND FAMILIES

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:15.567
WITH THEIR RIGHTS. THEY HAVE

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:17.502
ACCESS TO AND SO I THINK PARTY

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:19.137
WILL BE I'M STEPPING BACK AND

02:11:19.204 --> 02:11:21.039
THINKING STRONGLY ABOUT DOES

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:22.741
THAT LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE HAVE

02:11:22.808 --> 02:11:24.710
BETTER SUCCESS HOW DO WE NOT

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:27.412
MIX- SOMETHING. WE COULD HAVE

02:11:27.479 --> 02:11:29.214
INFORMATION- OR DATA OR AND SO

02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:31.583
I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:32.618
VERY STRONG THINKING IN THIS

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:34.486
AREA- PARTNER WITH OUR CARE

02:11:34.553 --> 02:11:36.555
PLANS A PROVIDER OUT WHAT IS

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:38.590
THE BEST APPROACH HOW ENSURE

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:41.260
THAT PEOPLE ARE GET ACCESS TO

02:11:41.326 --> 02:11:43.328
SERVICES THAT. I AM. AN THE IS

02:11:43.395 --> 02:11:44.930
NOT A GREAT. BUT I THINK PART

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:46.965
OF IT IS WE DID NOT KNOW HOW

02:11:47.032 --> 02:11:48.900
BAD THIS WAS THE DO NOT HAVE AN

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:49.701
ELEVEN THINK WE KNEW ABOUT THIS

02:11:49.768 --> 02:11:51.003
WAS BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.704
GIVEN THEM THE LEAD EXPOSURE

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.306
AND WHAT IT DOES TO CHILDREN.

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:56.808
AND BY WE I'M I'M TALKING BOTH

02:11:56.875 --> 02:12:00.379
YOU KNOW IT EVERY LEVEL- AND

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:01.480
THAT'S THAT'S NOT OKAY. IT'S

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:02.414
NOT A GOOD ANSWER BUT IT'S AN

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:03.649
HONEST ANSWER AND I CAN

02:12:03.715 --> 02:12:05.450
APPRECIATE THAT. SO I GUESS

02:12:05.517 --> 02:12:07.486
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS BECAUSE WE

02:12:07.552 --> 02:12:09.354
KNOW THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS TO

02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:11.256
CHILDREN THAT IT SHOULD BE ONE

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:13.358
OF THE TOP PRIORITIES FOR BOTH

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:14.726
DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THESE

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:16.895
TESTS ARE BEING DONE. BUT I

02:12:16.962 --> 02:12:18.730
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE- YOU

02:12:18.797 --> 02:12:21.133
KNOW WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:23.435
TREAT THESE CHILDREN BUT SHOULD

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:23.902
WE DO A BETTER JOB OF

02:12:23.969 --> 02:12:25.837
PREVENTION. I THINK IT GOES A

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:27.105
LITTLE BIT TO MS MITCHELL'S

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:28.740
POINT ABOUT US INDIVIDUALS

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.042
POINT ABOUT WHERE WE BUILD

02:12:30.108 --> 02:12:31.743
HOUSES AND WHATNOT SO THAT IS

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:33.345
ALL OF US. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO

02:12:33.412 --> 02:12:34.913
SEE THIS MOVIE TO IN A TIME IN

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.882
AN AREA WHERE WE ARE AND WE ARE

02:12:36.948 --> 02:12:39.251
PREVENTING IT SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:12:39.318 --> 02:12:39.851
TO WORRY ABOUT CHILDREN BEING

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:40.719
EXPOSED TO LEAD. AND DOCTOR PAN

02:12:40.786 --> 02:12:42.954
I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS

02:12:43.021 --> 02:12:44.389
ABOUT HOW LONG DO WE MAKE THE

02:12:44.456 --> 02:12:47.492
FORM- I AM A NEW GRANDMA AND

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:48.360
I'VE BEEN TO THE PEDIATRICIANS

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:52.030
OFFICE WITH MY DOG- FILLS. ARM

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:53.832
AND I GET TO LOOK AT HER AND

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:55.734
WHAT SHE DOINGTHAT. BUT IT'S A

02:12:55.801 --> 02:12:57.069
TWO PAGE FOR AND I MEAN IF WE-

02:12:57.135 --> 02:13:00.072
ASK YOUR TO WATCH. I WE CAN PUT

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.741
ON THAT FORM YOU KNOW THESE

02:13:02.808 --> 02:13:04.142
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:13:04.209 --> 02:13:06.778
YOUR CHILD IS EXPOSED TO LEAD.

02:13:06.845 --> 02:13:07.779
SO YOU THINK COULD MAKE TAKE

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:09.414
ALONG. I THINK YOU TAKE OUT MY

02:13:09.481 --> 02:13:10.716
LONGER I ALSO WONDERFUL. ABOUT

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.851
THOUGHT ABOUT DOORS. JUST IN

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:15.854
FOR. TO OUR SCHOOL. THAT THAT'S

02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:17.956
HOW WE USED TO GET. PERMISSION

COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:20.178
BECAUSE OF THAT. NO HOPEFULLY

RASCAL SYSTEM IS ANTIQUATED WE

02:15:27.719 --> 02:15:29.020
ARE STILL CLEANING DATA MINING

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:32.090
DATA. TO GET THE REPORTS

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:36.828
PRODUCED. OKAY WE HEARD FROM

THE AUDITOR THAT ONE OF THE

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:40.532
ISSUES THAT WAS GOING ON- AND

02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:41.800
WHY SOME OF THE DATA WASN'T

02:15:41.867 --> 02:15:43.301
BEING COLLECTED WAS BECAUSE

02:15:43.368 --> 02:15:44.903
THE- THERE WASN'T A DEPARTMENT

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:46.204
HEAD OR SOMETHING DO YOU HAVE

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:48.206
THE STAFF IN PLACE NOW. TO DO

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:49.941
TO SUPERVISE ALL OF THIS YES SO

02:15:50.008 --> 02:15:52.344
AS OF APRIL OF LAST YEAR WE

02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:54.946
HIRED A NEW BRANCH CHIEF- IN AS

02:15:55.013 --> 02:15:57.449
I MENTIONED TO YOU BEFORE-

02:15:57.516 --> 02:15:58.483
PRIOR TO HER EATING COMING ON

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:00.018
BOARD WE STARTED THE WHOLE

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.653
PROCESS OF LOOKING AT THE DATA

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.655
TRYING TO CLEAN THE DATA TRYING

02:16:03.722 --> 02:16:04.489
TO MAKE IT. UP TO DATE AND THE

02:16:04.556 --> 02:16:06.057
TIME WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.293
THE AUDITOR THEY WERE ABLE TO

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.595
GET SENIOR DATA THAT YOU KNOW

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:12.097
WE WERE ABLE TO. GO THROUGH AND

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:14.633
ARE NOT ONLY IS A NEW DAY EVEN

02:16:14.699 --> 02:16:17.235
PLACE BUT WERE ALSO IS- GOING

02:16:17.302 --> 02:16:19.971
THROUGH A LOT OF THE- YOU KNOW

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:21.640
MANAGEMENT CHANGES IN A- BRANCH.

02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:23.341
OR STAKEHOLDERS WERE CLOSER

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:26.011
WITH A LOCAL HEALTH- CLICK

02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:28.680
PROGRAMS TRYING TO IT YOU KNOW

02:16:28.747 --> 02:16:29.981
PROVE ON EVALUATION.

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:31.583
EXPECTATION IS THAT WE HAVE.

02:16:31.650 --> 02:16:33.151
THERE'S MORE THINGS THAT WERE

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:36.221
DOING. OR ELLERY ACTIVITIES

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:39.257
HAVE STOPPED WE CONTINUE TO FOR

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:42.093
EXAMPLE REACH OVER ONE POINT

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.461
TWO MILLION FAMILIES ANNUALLY

02:16:43.528 --> 02:16:54.039
WORK. ARE WORTH- BIT WE ARE

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:56.107
WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKING

02:16:56.174 --> 02:16:58.009
SURE THAT WE DO BETTER WITH THE

02:16:58.076 --> 02:17:00.979
REPORT IN OUR DATA IN ANOTHER

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:02.480
AND I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ON AND

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:05.417
OFF ON THE DOT ON. ANOTHER ONE-

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:07.218
WAS IT IN AND SOME THE

02:17:07.285 --> 02:17:08.353
DOCUMENTS WE GOT TODAY ONE OF

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:09.788
THE THINGS THAT WAS POINTED OUT

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:13.558
THAT- FUNDING FOR- DATA

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:15.126
COLLECTION ACTIVITIES OR OR

02:17:15.193 --> 02:17:16.895
THINGS IN COUNTIES. ISN'T

02:17:16.962 --> 02:17:19.297
ISN'T- ISN'T DISTRIBUTED IN A

02:17:19.364 --> 02:17:20.699
WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.801
EXAMPLE YOU HAVE IN ONE COUNTY

02:17:22.867 --> 02:17:25.070
YOU'VE GOT FORTY KIDS AND NEVER

02:17:25.136 --> 02:17:26.204
CAN YOU GOT EIGHTY KIDS WITH

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:27.405
THE COUNTY DISCOVER FORTIES

02:17:27.472 --> 02:17:29.574
GETTING MORE MONEY. SO WHEN CAN

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:32.177
WE EXPECT SOME REFORM IN IN HOW

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:33.979
YOU'RE ALLOCATING RESOURCES I

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:35.614
HAVE A COUNTY IT'S IT IS

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.649
HIGHLIGHTED IN THE REPORT THAT-

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:40.185
HUMBOLDT COUNTY THAT- IS ONE OF

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:41.453
THOSE COUNTIES THAT. WE GOT

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:43.855
PARENTS WHO WHO WHO WHO DON'T

02:17:43.922 --> 02:17:45.790
ALWAYS WANT TO COOPERATE AND I

02:17:45.857 --> 02:17:47.325
UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT MEANS

02:17:47.392 --> 02:17:48.226
THERE'S ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:51.396
AD EDUCATION AND SO ON TO TRY

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:53.098
TO HELP. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:54.566
THE REASONS THAT THAT THAT SOME

02:17:54.633 --> 02:17:55.700
OF THAT ACTIVITIES AND

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:56.801
HAPPENINGS THEY DON'T HAVE THE

02:17:56.868 --> 02:17:58.937
RESOURCES LOCALLY TO BE ABLE TO

02:17:59.004 --> 02:18:01.206
DO THAT. SO HOW DO WE GET THE

02:18:01.272 --> 02:18:03.475
FUNDING REFORM GOING AND HOW

02:18:03.541 --> 02:18:04.843
LONG COULD THAT TAPE BECAUSE

02:18:04.909 --> 02:18:07.879
IT'S CLEARLY NOT EQUITABLE- AND

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:11.316
THAT THAT'S JUST CONTINUE TO

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:12.684
ADD TO THE PROBLEMS. SO WE

02:18:12.751 --> 02:18:15.353
SPEND SOME TIME IN THE FALL OF

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:15.954
TWENTY NINETEEN SO JUST A FEW

02:18:16.021 --> 02:18:17.489
MONTHS AGO LOOKING AT OUR

02:18:17.555 --> 02:18:19.624
FUNDING FORMULA. WE UPDATED

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.159
BASED ON THE LATEST DATA THAT

02:18:21.226 --> 02:18:24.863
WE HAVE IN TERMS OF- A LITTLE

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:26.898
ELEVATED HE LEVELS BY COUNTY.

02:18:26.965 --> 02:18:28.333
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:30.869
OF LOOKING AT- A FUNDING

02:18:30.935 --> 02:18:32.804
MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO ELEVATE

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:34.906
THE FUNDING- FOR LOCAL HEALTH

02:18:34.973 --> 02:18:36.841
DEPARTMENTS IN AS YOU ARE AWARE

02:18:36.908 --> 02:18:38.376
OF. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:39.878
BUDGET PROCESS THE REPORT

02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:41.346
EXPLORE THE BUDGET PROCESS TO

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:42.514
SEE WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS WE

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.883
WOULD HAVE TO DO THAT. WE HAVE

02:18:44.949 --> 02:18:47.018
A GOOD SENSE OF NOW. BASED ON

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:48.987
THE NEW NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:50.255
HOW WE WULD APPROACH IT IN TE

02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:51.923
TYPE OF ALLOCATIONS THAT WE

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:54.092
WOULD MAKE. IT'S JUST NOW

02:18:54.159 --> 02:18:55.760
FINDING WHAT MECHANISM DO WE

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:59.230
HAVE TO ACTUALLY OF MAN OR

02:18:59.297 --> 02:18:59.864
AUTHORITY FROM THE BUDGET TO DO

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.299
SO. AND IT'S KIND OF A FINAL

02:19:01.366 --> 02:19:03.234
FINAL FINAL POINT HERE YOU KNOW

02:19:03.301 --> 02:19:04.436
THIS IS THE THIS IS NOW THE

02:19:04.502 --> 02:19:06.805
THIRD RECENT AUDIT THAT- HAS

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:08.406

RURAL EXPANSION SO YOU KNOW.

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:20.885
THAT THAT'S CRITICAL WIN WIN

02:19:20.952 --> 02:19:22.687
WIN BENEFICIARIES YOU'RE HAVING

02:19:22.754 --> 02:19:23.555
TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:26.057
SOMETIMES TO GET CARE- NOW WE

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.292
HAVE THE WE HAD THE PREVENTIVE

02:19:27.358 --> 02:19:30.929
CARE- ISSUE- AND NOW THIS ONE

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:32.831

WELL. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO IN OF

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:35.834
THE PLANS ARE PARTIALLY

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:37.969
RESPONSIBLE. BUT BUT IN

02:19:38.036 --> 02:19:39.904
EVERYONE OF THOSE AUDITS DH CS

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:42.006
HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED FOR NOT.

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:45.009
DOING THEIR THEIR JOB IN THAT.

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:47.278
AND I JUST WONDER HOW MANY MORE

02:19:47.345 --> 02:19:49.047
OF THESE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:51.483
ARE OUT THERE. AND THE

02:19:51.549 --> 02:19:53.251
FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE IS THAT

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:54.519
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN

02:19:54.586 --> 02:19:56.621
BECAUSE- WE'RE DOING WE'RE

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:57.956
PASSING LAWS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

02:19:58.022 --> 02:19:59.824
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE PROGRESS.

02:19:59.891 --> 02:20:01.025
AND YET OUR OWN DEPARTMENTS

02:20:01.092 --> 02:20:04.429
CAN'T SEEM TO MOVE ON ON THAT-

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:05.964
IT'S SAID THAT'S WHERE THAT'S

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:07.799
WHERE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS

02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:11.236
COMING FROM- IN. IT HOW DO HOW

02:20:11.302 --> 02:20:12.904
HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MORE IS OUT

02:20:12.971 --> 02:20:14.706
THERE I HAVE TO WONDER QUITE

02:20:14.773 --> 02:20:18.243
FRANKLY- YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE

02:20:18.309 --> 02:20:19.043
TERM LIMITS BEING THE WAY THEY

02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.745
WERE. SOME OF US WERE ONLY HERE

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:22.580

WAS PRETTY EASY TO IGNORE SOME

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:27.352

02:20:27.418 --> 02:20:29.320

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:35.527
ROLE AS LEGISLATORS IS

02:20:35.593 --> 02:20:38.596
OVERSIGHT. AND WHEN WE FIND

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:51.709
THE PACE SEEM SOMEWHAT GLACIAL.

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:56.481
QUITE FRANKLY- AND- I YOU KNOW.

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:58.516
CAN SOMEONE GIVE US HOPE THAT

02:20:58.583 --> 02:21:03.054

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:10.662
FACILITIES- AND SOME AND

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:12.897
DUPLICATION AND WASTE AND

02:21:12.964 --> 02:21:14.966

EXCUSES AND WE WOULD NOT USE

THAT THAT I WANTED TO ASK-

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:28.379
THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ABOUT

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:33.017
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLANTS

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:34.485
THE HEALTH PLANS FOR THE

02:31:34.552 --> 02:31:36.720
SANCTIONS AGAINST OUR OWN

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:38.355
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE TAKING

02:31:38.422 --> 02:31:39.723
CARE BUSINESS. OKAY TO DO

02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:41.659
SOMETHING. AND IF IT'S

02:31:41.725 --> 02:31:44.028
SOMETHING THAT YOU WORK. I SEE

02:31:44.094 --> 02:31:46.230
YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE IF YOU

02:31:46.297 --> 02:31:48.866
CANNOT DO IT DON'T ACCEPT THE

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:51.168
JOB. AND MAKE US BELIEVE THEIR

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:53.204
CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN CARE

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.771
OF BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING

02:31:53.838 --> 02:31:55.506
TAKEN CARE OF. WE'RE TALKING

02:31:55.573 --> 02:31:56.907

THAT COULD HAVE HAD THAT

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:05.449
TESTING AND DIDN'T HAVE IT.

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:09.253
ONLY 27% IT. THERE'S SOMETHING

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:13.123

IN TERMS OF ACTUAL SITES THAT

02:36:07.958 --> 02:36:09.660

DEPENDING ON EACH. COUNTY KINDA

02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:20.270
WHERE THEY'RE AT WITH IT.

02:36:20.337 --> 02:36:23.240
BECAUSE IT WAS COULD. OF THE

THE ANSWER IS CORRECT I MEAN

02:38:49.853 --> 02:38:50.687
THE PEDIATRICIAN OR THE FELLOW

02:38:50.754 --> 02:38:51.955
PRACTITIONER OF JEWEL

02:38:52.022 --> 02:38:53.457
PRACTITIONERS SEIZE THE CHILD

02:38:53.523 --> 02:38:56.093
AND THEN THEY DO THE TESTING

02:38:56.159 --> 02:38:57.227
THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE AGE

02:38:57.294 --> 02:38:59.596

THAT'S REALLY THAT'S REALLY

02:39:06.270 --> 02:39:09.039
WHERE THOSE ACTIVITIES OCCUR.

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:09.907
AND THEY ARE NOT PROHIBITED

02:39:09.973 --> 02:39:11.508
FROM ASKING ADDITIONAL

02:39:11.575 --> 02:39:13.477
QUESTIONS AROUND IF THEY'RE

PROVIDING CARE IN AN AREA THAT

HAS RISKS. OTHER THAN LEAD

02:39:17.381 --> 02:39:19.650
BASED PAINT. AND I THINK ONE OF

02:39:19.716 --> 02:39:20.784
THE THINGS THAT WE PLAN ON

02:39:20.851 --> 02:39:21.585
DOING AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:39:21.652 --> 02:39:23.353
CONVERSATIONS ON IS HOW TO BE

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.655
BETTER PARTNER WITH PUBLIC

02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:26.123
HEALTH IN REGARDS TO THEIR HOT

02:39:26.189 --> 02:39:28.058
SPOTTING REPORTS. ON THAT THEY

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:28.992
WILL BE DOING SO THAT IN

02:39:29.059 --> 02:39:30.193
ADDITION TO JUST THE THINGS

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:31.328
THAT WE WALK THROUGH AND ARE

02:39:31.395 --> 02:39:32.496
REPORTED THAT WE WILL BE DOING

02:39:32.562 --> 02:39:33.830
WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS.

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.565
HOW DO WE USE THAT TO DRIVE A

02:39:35.632 --> 02:39:37.768
VERY LASER FOCUS IN VERY CLEAR

02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:39.236
AREAS OF THE STATE ZIP CODES

02:39:39.303 --> 02:39:40.570
ARE COUNTIES WHERE WE SEE A

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:42.105
HIGHER ELEVATED LEVEL OF THESE

02:39:42.172 --> 02:39:43.707
BUT THAT. IN ADDITION TO ENSURE

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.208
THAT ALL CHILDREN GET TESTED

02:39:45.275 --> 02:39:45.976
DON'T TAKE MY COMMENTS THE

02:39:46.043 --> 02:39:48.211
WRONG WAY- BUT HOW DO WE ALSO

02:39:48.278 --> 02:39:49.646
DO ADDITIONAL HEIGHTENED

02:39:49.713 --> 02:39:50.714
SCRUTINY IN THOSE HOT SPOT

02:39:50.781 --> 02:39:51.949
AREAS THAT. HAVE BEEN

02:39:52.015 --> 02:39:53.317
IDENTIFIED WORKING WITH THEIR

02:39:53.383 --> 02:39:54.351
PLANS VERY CLOSELY IN THOSE

02:39:54.418 --> 02:39:55.953
AREAS A TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS

02:39:56.019 --> 02:39:58.188
UNDERSTAND ON THAT THERE IS A

02:39:58.255 --> 02:40:00.290
AN INCREASED RISKON IN THESE

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:01.091
PARTICULAR AREAS AND THEY

02:40:01.158 --> 02:40:02.192
SHOULD BE TAKING HEIGHTENED

02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:03.794
FOCUS IN EDUCATING FAMILIES

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.128
ABOUT THAT RISK IN CASE. YOU'RE

02:40:05.195 --> 02:40:06.163
FAMILIES DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:40:06.229 --> 02:40:07.497
DECLINE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.166
REGARDING THE TEST BUT MAKING

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:10.634
SURE PROVIDERS ARE HAVING A

02:40:10.701 --> 02:40:11.735
CONVERSATION WITH-

02:40:11.802 --> 02:40:13.036
BENEFICIARIES AND FAMILIES WHEN

02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:13.837
THEY COME IN THAT THIS IS A

02:40:13.904 --> 02:40:16.139
HIGH IN THE AREA. OF RISK IN

02:40:16.206 --> 02:40:16.740
THAT THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF

02:40:16.807 --> 02:40:19.309
THAT RISK ON IF DECLINE IN THE

02:40:19.376 --> 02:40:20.377
TEST AS WELL. AND I GUESS MY

02:40:20.444 --> 02:40:21.611
FINAL QUESTION MR JURORS

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:24.314
MEDICALLY I MEAN IT'S I THINK I

02:40:24.381 --> 02:40:25.649
HEARD DIRECTED TO WE GET THE

02:40:25.716 --> 02:40:29.419
MEDI CAL AND THE MEDICARE-

02:40:29.486 --> 02:40:33.190

02:40:33.256 --> 02:40:34.091
OF MY TWO AND A HALF. TO AND A

02:40:34.157 --> 02:40:35.826
HALF TO ONE OR- TWO. ONE AND

02:40:35.892 --> 02:40:38.195
TWO AND THEN. THE FEDERAL ONLY

REQUIRES ONE TEST AT AT ONE-

02:40:41.531 --> 02:40:44.868
WHERE TO ENTER. TWO AND A HALF

02:40:44.935 --> 02:40:45.435
HOURS SO THERE'S SO THERE'S

02:40:45.502 --> 02:40:49.272
DIFFERENT. STANDARDS OUT THERE-

02:40:49.339 --> 02:40:56.279
THAT THAT THAT ARE THERE. THE.

SITES AND ALL ITS BY- IT DENTAL

02:49:01.664 --> 02:49:02.799
BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AND WE

02:49:02.866 --> 02:49:04.100
HAD. WE FOUND ON THE DENTAL

02:49:04.167 --> 02:49:06.102
AUDIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT FOR

02:49:06.169 --> 02:49:07.070
TEN YEARS DIDN'T DO WHAT THE

02:49:07.136 --> 02:49:09.272
LAW ASK THEM TO DO TO MONITOR

02:49:09.339 --> 02:49:10.974
ACCESS. SO THESE THINGS COME UP

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:14.043
NOW. I JUST ALSO WANT TO SAY IS

02:49:14.110 --> 02:49:15.211
YOU KNOW WE DID A HEARING AN

02:49:15.278 --> 02:49:17.046
INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT

WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT THE

02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:21.684
MANAGED CARE ACTUALLY. FOR AT

02:49:21.751 --> 02:49:22.886
ON THE SENATE SIDE WE TALKED

02:49:22.952 --> 02:49:24.487
ABOUT OUR MANAGED CARE ACTUALLY

02:49:24.554 --> 02:49:25.788
TOOK LOOK LOOK BETTER MANAGED

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:27.690
CARE CONTRACTING WE DID IT

02:49:27.757 --> 02:49:31.494
WE'RE LOOKING AT CALLING. I

02:49:31.561 --> 02:49:35.198
THINK THAT RISE AS A IS THAT

02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:36.633
YEAH WE HAVE SOME NEW

02:49:36.699 --> 02:49:39.402
LEADERSHIP HERE I DO THINK

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:41.771
THAT- THAT AT LEAST IN THE TIME

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.239
I'VE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE I'VE

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:45.508
SEEN SOME VERY POSITIVE SHIFTS

02:49:45.575 --> 02:49:48.511
IN THE DEPARTMENT- I THINK THAT

02:49:48.578 --> 02:49:50.446
YOU KNOW WHEN I CAME IN I MEAN

02:49:50.513 --> 02:49:51.514
DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO SUFFERING

02:49:51.581 --> 02:49:54.050
FROM- WE WERE IN THE RECESSION

02:49:54.117 --> 02:49:54.684
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERY

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:57.320
PLACE WE COULD CUT. OKAY ALL

02:49:57.387 --> 02:49:59.322
RIGHT. I MEAN THAT'S JUST

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.724
REALITY BOB I DO THINK THAT IS

02:50:01.791 --> 02:50:03.593
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A-

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:05.895
CULTURE SHIFT IN IN THE

02:50:05.962 --> 02:50:06.930
DEPARTMENT I THINK WHAT HAS

02:50:06.996 --> 02:50:08.898
BEEN HAPPENING AS WELL BUT WE

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:11.000
NEED TO BE SURE THAT CONTINUES-

02:50:11.067 --> 02:50:11.734
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE

02:50:11.801 --> 02:50:13.570
PROACTIVE WAS THINGS I CRITIQUE

02:50:13.636 --> 02:50:14.871
THE DEPARTMENT BEFORE WAS IS

02:50:14.938 --> 02:50:16.239
THAT THEY WOULD TELL ME. WELL

02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:17.740
WE'RE MONITORING THINGS. AND I

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:19.542
LOOK AT THEM AND SAID WELL IT'S

02:50:19.609 --> 02:50:21.210
NOT JUST ENOUGH TO MONITOR TO

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:23.212
HAS TO BE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

02:50:23.279 --> 02:50:24.814
STANDARDS WHAT ARE DAY. BECAUSE

02:50:24.881 --> 02:50:26.316
THERE'S SOME POINT THAT YOU CAN

02:50:26.382 --> 02:50:27.584
MONITOR SOMETHING'S IT WILL THE

02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:29.118
RESULT IS THIS AT WHAT POINT

02:50:29.185 --> 02:50:29.719
YOU SEE THAT RESULT IS

02:50:29.786 --> 02:50:32.155
UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S TOO BAD IT'S

02:50:32.221 --> 02:50:33.923
REALLY BAD YOU KNOW HE'S A- AND

02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:37.026
DELUDE SO AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:50:37.093 --> 02:50:38.628
THE DEPARTMENT NOW IS SITTING

02:50:38.695 --> 02:50:40.296
SOME HIGHER STANDARDS RIGHT AND

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:41.397
ACTUALLY SAYING THAT THERE ARE

02:50:41.464 --> 02:50:42.966
THINGS. SO THAT'S A GOOD

02:50:43.032 --> 02:50:44.867
POSITIVE DIRECTION WE'RE MOVING

02:50:44.934 --> 02:50:47.770
IN. SO I GUESS WHAT I WANNA SAY

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.472

WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD I

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.355
APPRECIATE ACTUALLY THE

02:51:05.421 --> 02:51:07.256
INVESTMENT THAT. THE STAFF MADE

02:51:07.323 --> 02:51:09.192
AND CAL AIMS TO TRY TO TAKE A

02:51:09.258 --> 02:51:12.095
MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH- I ALSO

02:51:12.161 --> 02:51:14.263
RECOGNIZED BY THE WAY THAT- WE

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:15.832
PROBABLY ACTUALLY NEED TO STAFF

02:51:15.898 --> 02:51:17.634
UP THE DEPARTMENT. MORE

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.469
BANDWIDTH WISE OKAY I MEAN TO

02:51:19.535 --> 02:51:20.136
THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS

02:51:20.203 --> 02:51:22.405
DEPARTMENTS HAD TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:51:22.472 --> 02:51:23.840
IN THE TIME SINCE LA IT'S I'VE

02:51:23.906 --> 02:51:26.342
BEEN THE LEGISLATURE- BUT AT

02:51:26.409 --> 02:51:28.311
SAME TIME EVEN AS WE- STEPPED

02:51:28.378 --> 02:51:31.280
UP. WE NEED TO ALSO INFUSE A

02:51:31.347 --> 02:51:32.749
DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY ABOUT THE

02:51:32.815 --> 02:51:35.051
ROLESDEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF

02:51:35.118 --> 02:51:36.486
BEING MORE PROACTIVE. ABOUT

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:38.287
THESE THINGS YOU KNOW I THINK

02:51:38.354 --> 02:51:38.988
IT'S ALWAYS FRUSTRATING TO

02:51:39.055 --> 02:51:42.125
HAPPEN AUDIT AND THEN SAY. OH

02:51:42.191 --> 02:51:44.293
WELL SORRY WE'RE GONNA TRY TO

02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.262
DO BETTER NOW. LIKE WHY DIDN'T

02:51:46.329 --> 02:51:47.864
YOU KNOW FOR THE AUDIT OKAY SO

02:51:47.930 --> 02:51:49.198
WHAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:50.166
WHEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE

02:51:50.233 --> 02:51:51.300
DENTAL AND WE CAN SO FOR. ALL

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:53.503
RIGHT SO I THINK THAT AND BY

02:51:53.569 --> 02:51:55.471
THE TIME BY THE TIME WE ASK FOR

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:56.372
NOT THERE'S A REASONWE ASK FOR

02:51:56.439 --> 02:51:57.674
THE AUDIT THERE WERE A LOT OF

02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:59.275
SIGNS OUT THERE RIGHT SO. I'M

02:51:59.342 --> 02:52:00.943
HOPING WE CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE

02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:02.378

02:52:02.445 --> 02:52:03.680

DO YOU WANT TO GIVE SOME PROPS

02:52:13.856 --> 02:52:15.291
THAT THINGS I THINK ARE MOVING

02:52:15.358 --> 02:52:16.426
IN A MORE POSITIVE ACTION I

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:19.062
KNOW. I CERTAINLY- WHY EXPRESS

02:52:19.128 --> 02:52:20.997
MY HOPE AND MY CONFIDENCE THAT

02:52:21.064 --> 02:52:22.732
THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP IS GONNA

02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:24.033
CONTINUE TAKING IT IN THAT

02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:29.038
DIRECTION. AND THAT HOPEFULLY

02:52:29.105 --> 02:52:29.906
WE WILL. THAT WE'LL SEE SOME

02:52:29.972 --> 02:52:30.873
EVEN BETTER RESULTS. KLAY THIS

02:52:30.940 --> 02:52:34.343
IS AN FOR. ANOTHER CAN A BLACK

02:52:34.410 --> 02:52:37.580
GUY- THE PREVIOUS AUDITS THAT

02:52:37.647 --> 02:52:39.515

02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:48.057
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ICING

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.525
CERTAINLY I THINK- WE HAVE SOME

02:52:49.592 --> 02:52:52.361
FRUSTRATION BUT- I AM HOPEFUL-

02:52:52.428 --> 02:52:55.064
THAT- BUT WE WILL BOTH HOPEFUL

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:56.165

THOSE ISSUES. AND ACTUALLY I

02:53:02.705 --> 02:53:04.907
APPRECIATE THAT THE- HONESTY OF

02:53:04.974 --> 02:53:05.842
THEIR CURRENT LEADERSHIP AND

02:53:05.908 --> 02:53:08.144
SAY HEY WE FIND OUT MORE- WILL

02:53:12.348 --> 02:53:14.183
QUESTION I HAVE- BECAUSE I KNOW

02:53:14.250 --> 02:53:16.786
WE ALSO HAVE CD PEACH HERE- SO

02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:17.820
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

02:53:17.887 --> 02:53:18.955
AUDIT REPORT ALSO POINTED OUT

02:53:19.021 --> 02:53:20.189

PROGRAM SO WE TALKED ABOUT YOU

02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:22.825
KNOW WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE A

02:53:22.892 --> 02:53:25.528
POSITIVE. IS OPERATING AT

02:53:25.595 --> 02:53:30.433
DEFICIT. AND SO I DON'T KNOW IS

02:53:30.500 --> 02:53:31.834
AM I EXPECTING MY BUDGET

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:33.970
SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE A REQUEST

02:53:34.036 --> 02:53:35.805
FOR A AUGMENTATION THE BUDGET

02:53:35.872 --> 02:53:38.908
RIGHT RIGHT A RISE IN THE FEE

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:40.143
TO COVER THIS SO THAT WE

02:53:40.209 --> 02:53:40.910
ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE

02:53:40.977 --> 02:53:42.845
RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS

02:53:42.912 --> 02:53:45.715
BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS THE PRO

02:53:45.782 --> 02:53:46.549
ACTIVITY ALL RIGHT I MEAN WE

COME TO AGREEMENT BUT I ALSO

02:53:54.557 --> 02:53:55.992
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION. NEEDS

02:53:56.058 --> 02:53:57.727
TO STEP UP AND PROPOSE THINGS

02:53:57.794 --> 02:53:58.995

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:48.664
ABATEMENT EFFORTS ERE EITHER

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:50.966
LIMITED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL UNIT

03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:53.869
IN A MULTI FAMILY DWELLING

03:01:53.936 --> 03:01:56.272
WARS. THAT FAMILY AND THAT

03:01:56.338 --> 03:01:58.674
CHILD MOVED OUT OF THAT UNIT

03:01:58.741 --> 03:02:00.409
AND NO ABATEMENT WAS DONE AND

03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:02.077
ANOTHER CHILD MOVED IN.

03:02:02.144 --> 03:02:03.779
ESSENTIALLY CAUSING EACH CHILD

03:02:03.846 --> 03:02:06.115
TO SERVICE THEIR OWN CANARY IN

03:02:06.181 --> 03:02:07.449
THE LEAD MINE SHAFT THAT'S

03:02:07.516 --> 03:02:08.851
ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A

03:02:08.917 --> 03:02:10.719
LEAD HAZARD AND- I REALLY

03:02:10.786 --> 03:02:12.054
APPRECIATED ONE OF THE COMMENTS

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:14.456
EARLIER THAT IN SACRAMENTO.

03:02:14.523 --> 03:02:15.457
THERE ARE TEN APARTMENT

03:02:15.524 --> 03:02:16.759
COMPLEXES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:02:16.825 --> 03:02:19.962
IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF.

03:02:20.029 --> 03:02:22.197
ELEVATED LAD IN THE COUNTY

03:02:22.264 --> 03:02:24.166
WHERE I'M AT AND IF WE WERE

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:26.035
DOING OUR JOBS IF WE WEREN'T

03:02:26.101 --> 03:02:28.470
SHE- ONLY TESTING BUT WE WERE

03:02:28.537 --> 03:02:29.338
DOING THE ABATEMENT THAT WAS

03:02:29.405 --> 03:02:31.340
NECESSARY. AND A WIDER

03:02:31.407 --> 03:02:34.743
ABATEMENT- WHERE WE DON'T JUST

03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:36.412
LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN IN

03:02:36.478 --> 03:02:38.814
INDIVIDUAL UNITS WE MIGHT NOT

03:02:38.881 --> 03:02:40.115
HAVE THAT DATA TO LOOK AT RIGHT

03:02:40.182 --> 03:02:43.085
NOW. SO I APPRECIATED- ONE OF

03:02:43.152 --> 03:02:44.687
THE COMMENTS EARLIER THAT THE

03:02:44.753 --> 03:02:46.388
DATA ARE GOOD RESULTS ARE

03:02:46.455 --> 03:02:49.825
BETTER. IN SOME WAYS WE ALREADY

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:52.695
HAVE AN- TO ACT IN DO SOMETHING

03:02:52.761 --> 03:02:54.263
TO PROTECT KIDS EVEN AS WE'RE

03:02:54.330 --> 03:02:55.798
WAITING FOR MORE TESTING TO BE

03:02:55.864 --> 03:02:57.533
DONE AND BETTER DATED TO BE.

03:02:57.599 --> 03:03:00.502
MADE AVAILABLE. AFTER I CAME TO

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:02.404
CALIFORNIA NINETEEN NINETY

03:03:02.471 --> 03:03:03.138
EIGHT I WAS ON THE CALIFORNIA

03:03:03.205 --> 03:03:04.673
LED SCREENING ADVISORY TASK

03:03:04.740 --> 03:03:09.511
FORCE FROM NINETEEN- NINETEEN

03:03:09.578 --> 03:03:10.379
ONE. THERE I ARGUED FOR SOME

03:03:10.446 --> 03:03:11.513
FOCUS ON HOUSING

03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:14.350
CHARACTERISTICS- IN LIMITING

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:17.486
LET IT- EXPOSURE AND TARGET IS

03:03:17.553 --> 03:03:19.621
STRAINING EFFORTS WHERE WE SAW

03:03:19.688 --> 03:03:22.191
HOT SPOTS. BUT THE DIRECTION IT

03:03:22.257 --> 03:03:23.792
CAN COMMITTEE WAS TO ADVOCATE

03:03:23.859 --> 03:03:25.160
FOR UNIVERSAL SCREENING OF ALL

03:03:25.227 --> 03:03:26.695
CHILDREN RECEIVING PUBLIC

03:03:26.762 --> 03:03:31.133
ASSISTANCE. FAST FORWARD IN TWO

03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:32.000
THOUSAND SEVEN I DID A STUDY OF

03:03:32.067 --> 03:03:33.669
MY OWN CLINICS LET'S GREETING

03:03:33.736 --> 03:03:35.604
EFFORT LOOKED AT TWO HUNDRED

03:03:35.671 --> 03:03:37.906
AND FORTY ONE CHILDREN WHAT I

03:03:37.973 --> 03:03:39.842
HAV THE ABILITY TO GET DOWN TO

03:03:39.908 --> 03:03:41.777
A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL THAN THE

03:03:41.844 --> 03:03:44.046
HUGE VERY IMPRESSIVE STUDY THAT

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:46.148
WERE IS THE FOCUS OF THIS

03:03:46.215 --> 03:03:48.851
COMMITTEE MEETING- AND THERE

03:03:48.917 --> 03:03:51.387
ARE. AT THAT TIME THE-

03:03:51.453 --> 03:03:54.022
GUIDELINE FOR- ACTION LEVEL OF

03:03:54.089 --> 03:03:59.061
CONCERN WAS TEN AND- WE DID BY

03:03:59.128 --> 03:04:01.029
THOSE LEVELS ADD. AT TWELVE

03:04:01.096 --> 03:04:02.898
MONTHS AND THEN A YEAR LATER WE

03:04:02.965 --> 03:04:05.367
ONLY FOUND ONE CHILDREN ONE

03:04:05.434 --> 03:04:07.669
CHILD THAT SCREEN POSITIVE.

03:04:07.736 --> 03:04:08.971
ABOUT TEN MICROGRAMS PER

03:04:09.037 --> 03:04:11.306
DECILITER IN THE REMAINDER TWO

03:04:11.373 --> 03:04:13.776
HUNDRED. FORTY CHILDREN NONE OF

03:04:13.842 --> 03:04:15.477
THEM HAD A BLOOD LEAD LEVEL

03:04:15.544 --> 03:04:18.013
OVER TEN- IN THEIR SECOND

03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:23.185
SCREENING SO WE DID. TWO

03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:24.987
HUNDRED AND FORTY TEST TWICE

03:04:25.053 --> 03:04:26.889
SHOWING NO BLOOD THAT LEVEL BUT

03:04:26.955 --> 03:04:30.259
PART OF THAT IS- THE COMMUNITY

03:04:30.325 --> 03:04:31.627
THAT WE'RE SERVING AND THE

03:04:31.693 --> 03:04:34.563
LEVEL OF CONCERN. OF ATTENDED

03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:35.898
THE TIME FAST FORWARDED NOW THE

03:04:35.964 --> 03:04:38.500
LEVEL CONCERN IS NOW ABOVE- A

03:04:38.567 --> 03:04:40.803
FIVE MICROGRAM AND STIRRED- PER

03:04:40.869 --> 03:04:43.105
DECILITER FOR THE LAD. AND I

03:04:43.172 --> 03:04:46.742
LOOKED AT MY CLINICS DATA- IN

03:04:46.809 --> 03:04:48.644
PREPARATION FOR TODAY LAST YEAR

03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:50.646
I'M JUST TAKING ONE YEAR SWIPE

03:04:50.712 --> 03:04:52.781
SO I CAN SEE WHERE WE ARE MY

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:55.350
CLINIC TESTED THE BLOOD OF

03:04:55.417 --> 03:04:57.152
SIXTY FOUR CHILDREN. AGES TWO

03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:59.955
TO FIVE- THIS IS BOTH PUBLICLY

03:05:00.022 --> 03:05:03.091
AND PRIVATELY INSURED AND ONLY

03:05:03.158 --> 03:05:05.594
ONE IT WAS ABOVE FOUR POINT

03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:07.095
NINE MICROGRAMS PER DECILITER

03:05:07.162 --> 03:05:09.765
AND THAT ONE. IS NINE POINT SIX

03:05:09.832 --> 03:05:11.033
ON THE FIRST TEST OF THE YEAR

03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:12.768
AND SIX POINT SEVEN IS

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:14.670
SUBSEQUENT TESTING DOWN FROM

03:05:14.736 --> 03:05:18.106
THE PRIOR YEARS OF ELEVEN POINT

03:05:18.173 --> 03:05:19.975
FOUR SO AMONG THE- I SIXTY FOUR

03:05:20.042 --> 03:05:23.812
CHILDREN. ONLY WILL ONE KID WAS

03:05:23.879 --> 03:05:25.047
IDENTIFIED ME WAS ALREADY

03:05:25.113 --> 03:05:26.615
IDENTIFIED THERE WAS NO NEW

03:05:26.682 --> 03:05:29.751
CASES OF BLOOD LEAD- IT- THERE

03:05:29.818 --> 03:05:31.420
WAS IDENTIFIED AS IT WAS GOING

03:05:31.487 --> 03:05:33.555
THROUGH THIS GRANULAR DATA I

03:05:33.622 --> 03:05:35.057
SAW ONE CHILD WHOSE LAST YEAR

03:05:35.123 --> 03:05:37.359
HAD A TASK THAT WAS TWENTY TWO

03:05:37.426 --> 03:05:39.695
POINT THREE. AND THEN TEN DAYS

03:05:39.761 --> 03:05:43.999
LATER. WAS ONE POINT FIVE. AND

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:46.235
SO WHEN WE HAVE TESTS LIKE THAT

03:05:46.301 --> 03:05:46.835
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE A

03:05:46.902 --> 03:05:48.904
CONTAMINATED FIRST SAMPLE AND

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:50.038
THEN WE GET A VENUS SAMPLE

03:05:50.105 --> 03:05:53.375
AFTERWARDS. I DON'T BELIEVE

03:05:53.442 --> 03:05:54.910
THAT CHILD HAD A TWENTY TWO

03:05:54.977 --> 03:05:57.412
POINT THREE. AND THAT THE VENUS

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:59.748
SAMPLE WAS TRUE AND MY QUESTION

03:05:59.815 --> 03:06:01.617
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LARGE

03:06:01.683 --> 03:06:03.819
STATUS AT THAT. DOESN'T HAVE

03:06:03.886 --> 03:06:05.888
THE SAME GRANULAR LEVEL HOW

03:06:05.954 --> 03:06:08.590
MANY OF THOSE TWENTY TWO POINT

03:06:08.657 --> 03:06:09.224
THREE CENT TEST LIKE THAT STAY

03:06:09.291 --> 03:06:11.460
IN THE DATA. THAT DON'T GIVE US

03:06:11.527 --> 03:06:14.530
GOOD DATA AS TO WHERE OUR KIDS

03:06:14.596 --> 03:06:19.201
ARE TRULY AT RISK. SO I HAVE

03:06:19.268 --> 03:06:21.436
QUESTIONS TO- DO WE HAVE THE

03:06:21.503 --> 03:06:23.639
BEST DATA WE I'VE ALREADY

03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:26.074
BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF- HIGH

03:06:26.141 --> 03:06:28.143
LEVELS FOLLOWED BY NORMAL LEVEL

03:06:28.210 --> 03:06:30.379
IF THE- AUDITOR'S TOOK THAT

03:06:30.445 --> 03:06:33.015
INTO ACCOUNT. I AND I ALSO

03:06:33.081 --> 03:06:34.650
DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT

03:06:34.716 --> 03:06:36.051
THEY WERE ABLE TO LOOK AND SEE

03:06:36.118 --> 03:06:38.186
WHERE PRIOR TESTS WERE DONE FOR

03:06:38.253 --> 03:06:39.988
THE KIDS TO GO ON AN OFF MEDI

03:06:40.055 --> 03:06:42.457
CAL THE GO ON AND OFF PRIVATE

03:06:42.524 --> 03:06:44.960
INSURANCE AND THEY MAY GET A

03:06:45.027 --> 03:06:48.330
TEST IN THERE ARE- THERE ARE-

03:06:48.397 --> 03:06:50.232
HEALTH CARE'S ACILITY WITH

03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:52.601
THEIR OTHER INSURANCE AND IT

03:06:52.668 --> 03:06:55.270
MAY OR MAY NOT MATCH UP I

03:06:55.337 --> 03:06:56.638
RECOGNIZE THERE'S ENOUGH OF A

03:06:56.705 --> 03:06:59.207
PROBLEM IF WE TOOK OUT THAT

03:06:59.274 --> 03:07:01.209
NOISE THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND

03:07:01.276 --> 03:07:02.678
I'VE LOOKING AT MY OWN CLINIC

03:07:02.744 --> 03:07:10.852
DATA. I SAW THAT- WE TESTED A.

03:07:10.919 --> 03:07:13.288
A 70% EITHER THEY WERE TESTED

03:07:13.355 --> 03:07:17.392
OR THEY WERE- PRIOR SCREEN NOT

03:07:17.459 --> 03:07:19.094
TO THE 80% THATYOU ARE LOOKING

03:07:19.161 --> 03:07:20.929
FOR THE STATE NOT TO THE 100%

03:07:20.996 --> 03:07:22.197
THAT I'M LOOKING FOR BUT AS A

03:07:22.264 --> 03:07:24.366
RESULT OF THAT TESTING AS A

03:07:24.433 --> 03:07:27.369
RESULT OF THIS- AUDIT REPORT IN

03:07:27.436 --> 03:07:29.371
MY LOOKING AT MY OWN DATA- I

03:07:29.438 --> 03:07:31.740
TOOK STEPS TO CONTACT EVERYONE

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:32.841
OF THE PROVIDERS GIVING THEM

03:07:32.908 --> 03:07:35.043
INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION SO THAT

03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:36.712
ARE TESTING RESULTS OF GET

03:07:36.778 --> 03:07:38.580
HIGHER BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE

03:07:38.647 --> 03:07:40.549
THAT BY ITSELF. WILL TAKE CARE

03:07:40.616 --> 03:07:42.284
OF THE PROBLEM AND I EXPECT

03:07:42.351 --> 03:07:43.952
THAT THIS HEARING ACTUALLY WILL

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:46.488
IMPROVE TESTING THAT-NUMBER OF

03:07:46.555 --> 03:07:48.790
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT IT BUT I ALSO

03:07:48.857 --> 03:07:52.060
AM HOPING THAT COUPLED WITH

03:07:52.127 --> 03:07:54.863
INCREASED TESTING. WE LOOK AT

03:07:54.930 --> 03:07:56.064
ABATEMENT AND WE LOOK AT

03:07:56.131 --> 03:07:58.500
ABATEMENT WIDER THAN INDIVIDUAL

03:07:58.567 --> 03:08:00.736
UNITS FORCING EVERY CHILD TO BE

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:02.771
THEIR OWN CANARY. IN THAT LED

03:08:02.838 --> 03:08:05.140
MINE SHAFT. IF WE IDENTIFY A

03:08:05.207 --> 03:08:07.709
UNIT. WHERE THERE'S ONE CHILD

03:08:07.776 --> 03:08:11.246
WE OBEYED THE ENTIRE UNIT. THEN

03:08:11.313 --> 03:08:13.815
WE HAVE PREVENT SAID EXPOSURE

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:15.851
TOOL A NUMBER OF KIDS AND SO

03:08:15.917 --> 03:08:18.453
THAT. PART OF MY PERSPECTIVE IS

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:20.422
I COULD GET TO A GRANULAR LEVEL

03:08:20.489 --> 03:08:23.058
I CARE ABOUT. PREVENTING LEAD

03:08:23.125 --> 03:08:26.328
EXPOSURE IN KIDS- THERE IS NO

03:08:26.395 --> 03:08:29.965
SAFE BLOOD LEAD LEVEL. AND IT'S

03:08:30.032 --> 03:08:31.566
MY HOPE THAT AS WE IMPROVE

03:08:31.633 --> 03:08:34.036
TESTING WE ALSO TAKE THE DATA

03:08:34.102 --> 03:08:35.504
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE

03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:37.806
WONDERFUL DATA THAT SHOWS THAT

03:08:37.873 --> 03:08:39.207
THE AUDITOR SHOW WHERE THESE

03:08:39.274 --> 03:08:42.344
HOTSPOTS ARE. AND WE DO THE

03:08:42.411 --> 03:08:45.914
HARDER WORK- OF ABATING.

03:08:45.981 --> 03:08:47.749
GETTING THE LEAD OUT OF THE

03:08:47.816 --> 03:08:50.152
LIVES OF KIDS WHERE THE A- LIVE

03:08:50.218 --> 03:08:53.689
WHERE THEY PLAY- WHERE- THEY'RE

03:08:53.755 --> 03:08:56.358
FORCED TO BE AT TIMES. NOT

03:08:56.425 --> 03:08:58.260
HAVING AS MANY CHOICES IN THEIR

03:08:58.326 --> 03:09:00.162
OWN LIVES AS SOME OF THE REST

03:09:00.228 --> 03:09:02.330
OF US HAVE SO I WILL TAKE

03:09:02.397 --> 03:09:06.334
QUESTIONS THAT'S- MY PASSION IS

03:09:06.401 --> 03:09:08.470
TAKING CARE OF KIDS AND I'M

03:09:08.537 --> 03:09:09.071
HOPING THAT WE DON'T STOP WITH

03:09:09.137 --> 03:09:13.075
JUST TESTING. THANK YOU THANK

03:09:13.141 --> 03:09:14.710
YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. LET ME

03:09:14.776 --> 03:09:17.746
ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. I

03:09:17.813 --> 03:09:18.380
JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION COULD

03:09:18.447 --> 03:09:19.014
YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

03:09:19.081 --> 03:09:20.348
ABATEMENT AND YOU KNOW EARLIER

03:09:20.415 --> 03:09:22.050
IN THE PREVIOUS PANELS WE HAD

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:24.953
ASKED ABOUT. THE I GUESS WILL

03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:26.788
RECALL THE ENACT WHAT ABILITY

03:09:26.855 --> 03:09:28.023
AND THE METHODOLOGY FOR

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:29.958
ALLOCATING FUNDS. RIGHT TO THE

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:32.961
LOCAL AGENCIES IT WAS THE SLIDE

03:09:33.028 --> 03:09:34.396
IF YOU YEAH I CAN'T REALLY

03:09:34.463 --> 03:09:36.431
SPEAK ON THAT BECAUSE AS A

03:09:36.498 --> 03:09:37.933
PEDIATRICIAN AND RUNNING A

03:09:37.999 --> 03:09:41.837
CLINIC- WE HAND OVER THE

03:09:41.903 --> 03:09:43.138
ELEVATOR REPORTS TO THE HEALTH

03:10:18.440 --> 03:10:20.609
AND THEN THE LACK OF- SCREENING

03:10:20.675 --> 03:10:22.277
AND PARTIALLY ASSOCIATE WITH

03:10:22.344 --> 03:10:23.912
THE FACT THAT WE ALSO HAVE LOW

03:10:23.979 --> 03:10:25.013
PERCENTAGES MEDI CAL PATIENTS
