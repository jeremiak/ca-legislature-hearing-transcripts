ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION THIRTY SEVEN BY SOME THE MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. THIS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. IT BEGAN ON APRIL TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN. FOR EIGHT LONG YEARS THE ARMENIAN NATION WAS SUBJECTED TO A SYSTEMATIC AND PREMEDITATED GENOCIDE AT THE HANDS OF THE OTTOMAN TURKISH EMPIRE AND THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO OR THESE VICTIMS THEY WERE FATHERS MOTHERS? SISTERS AND BROTHERS IN CHILDREN. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ARMENIAN LIVES WERE LOST HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ASSYRIANS GREEKS HAD OTHER CHRISTIANS PERISHED IN ONE OF THE MOST ATROCIOUS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS HISTORY. THIS WAS THE FIRST GENOCIDE. TWENTIETH CENTURY. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MOST ARMENIANS KNEW SOMEBODY WHO WAS A THEMSELVES OR SURVIVOR. OR A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF A SURVIVOR BUT NOW THAT WERE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE YEARS LATER. THOSE SURVIVORS THEMSELVES OF COURSE ARE FADING. AND IN SOME CASES THE MEMORIES OF THAT GENOCIDE. FADING. BUT NOT AMONGST THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE OF OUR WORK NOT HEARING CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY A HUNDRED AND THREE YEARS LATER WE ARE HERE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR TODAY TO REMEMBER THOSE LIVES LOST. THOSE HOPES THOSE DREAMS THOSE LOVES. ALL. TAKEN AWAY DURING THIS VERY DARK PERIOD IN TWENTIETH CENTURY HISTORY. AS WE PAY OUR SOLEMN TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF THESE UNSPEAKABLE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. LET'S REMEMBER THAT WERE ALSO HERE TO RENEW OUR VOW. TO NEVER LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN. TO NEVER BE THE BYSTANDER THAT STANDS IDLY BY. AS GENOCIDE HAPPENS. AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY IN ELECTED LEADERS IT'S OUR DUTY TO ENSURE THAT OUR NATION AND OUR WORLD RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE FOR WHAT IT WAS. DENYING THE ATROCITIES ARE REMAINING SILENT INVITES REOCCURRENCE. OUR MODERN HISTORY IS SADLY FULL OF EXAMPLES OF THE PERILS OF SILENCE. LESS THEN A DECADE AFTER THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WHICH BY THE WAY WAS REPORTED ABOUT AN AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS IN THERE WERE EVEN FAMOUS AMERICAN EFFORTS TO HELP VICTIMS OF THE GENOCIDE. SO LESS THAN A DECADE LATER. HITLER DEVELOP HIS PLANS FOR THE HOLOCAUST AND REASSURED HIS COMMANDERS THAT THEY WOULD NOT FACE RETRIBUTION. HE DECLARED WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS. TODAY OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS. EVEN TODAY THOSE PERPETRATORS OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. WE'RE NEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE. REPARATIONS WERE NEVER FULLY MADE NEVER MADE IT ALL BY THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT TO THOSE VICTIMS. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMIND CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD THAT WOULD WITH ANY GROUP IS MARGINALIZED OR DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WE ALL HAVE A DUTY TO SPEAK UP TO PUSH BACK IN THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. SO THAT NO ONE WILL KNOW THE PAIN. THAT OUR ANCESTORS DID. AND SPEAKING OUT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE JUST YESTERDAY OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHER IN YOUR VAN TO PROTEST. UNDEMOCRATIC ACTIONS BY THE ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT. I'M VERY PROUD THAT IN MY CITY OF GLENDALE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TOOK TO THE STREETS IN SOLIDARITY. WITH THEIR BROTHERS AND SISTER IN ARMENIA. AND YOU KNOW WHAT. THOSE VOICES MATTERED. JUST THIS MORNING THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED CHANGES. THAT WILL MAKE ARMENIA. THE DEMOCRACY THAT ITS PEOPLE WANTED TO BE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THOSE BRAVE VOICES WHO STOOD UP. IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO THE SAME HERE. AND TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE IN CALLING FOR WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND YET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AMERICA HAS YET TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE FOR WHAT IT WAS. BUT I KNOW THAT JUST AS THOSE ARMENIAN VOICES. GOT. THE DEMOCRACY THEY CALLED FOR. THAT WE WILL GET THAT WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION FOR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT QUIET. IN LOS ANGELES ON MARCH THAT USED TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NOW HAS OVER A MILLION PEOPLE EVERY YEAR TO COMMEMORATE GENOCIDE AND TURKEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO IGNORE THOSE VOICES BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY. AND THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF JUSTICE. BECAUSE OF THAT I ASK YOU ALL TO PLEASE JOIN ME. NOT JUST VOTING I ON THIS RESOLUTION BUT IN COAUTHOR RING IT'S THAT WE HAVE A UNITED AND LOUD VOICE SAYING THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE DENIED. THAT THOSE VICTIMS WERE NOT REST IN PEACE UNTIL THIS GENOCIDE IS RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND THANK YOU MEMBERS. DAVIS REMAIN MISTER HOLDING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT. OF THIS LEGISLATION AG OUR THIRTY SEVEN ARISE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS.

I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF ARMENIAN AMERICANS AROUND THE WORLD FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR THE ARMENIAN. COMMUNITY. THEIR CAUSE IS THE SAME PURSUIT OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS EVERYWHERE. JUST AS DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WON SAID. AN INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT. TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE. THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ARMENIANS UNDER THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVES OR NATIVE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. DESPITE GENOCIDE AND ETHNIC CLEANSING WE SEE THE FUTURE GENERATIONS REALIZE THE ATROCITIES OF THE PAST AND FIGHT. FOR A BETTER FUTURE. WE REMEMBER THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE TODAY WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO FIGHTING SYSTEMATIC INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY BY GOVERNMENTS EVERYWHERE. AND JOIN THEIR CAUSE TO STOP FUTURE GENOCIDES. AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN CELEBRATE LIFE AFTER THE COURAGE TO SURVIVE.

WHAT IS SURELY KILLED BUT ARE RAPED ARE BRANDED ARE FORCED TO LIVE AS SEX SLAVES AND FORCED WIVES WITH THE FLAGS OF THE OPPRESSORS TATTOOED ON THEIR FACES AND HANDS? BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T KEPT WHICH THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD AND KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN WERE KILLED BUT WE DO KNOW SO MANY OF THEM AFTER THEIR HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN AND UNCLES AND FATHERS WERE MARCHED OFF AND KILLED.

BY HELPING LAUNCH THE NEAR EAST RELIEF. THIS CONGRESSIONALLY CHARTERED HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION CREATED A SPECIAL BOND BETWEEN AMERICANS IN THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE WHICH CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. THIS BOND IS PARTICULARLY STRONG HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE CONTINUE TO SEEK JUSTICE FOR THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE CELEBRATE THE SURVIVAL.

THAT MIGHT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE MENTIONED THAT HITLER SAID UPON HIS INVASION OF OAKLAND AND AS HE EMBARKS UPON THE FINAL SOLUTION TO EXTERMINATE. THE WORLD'S JEWS WHEN HE SAID WHO AFTER ALL SPEAKS TODAY. OF THE ANNIHILATION OF THE ARMENIANS. WE DO. WE SPEAK TODAY WE SPEAK IN UNISON TO COMMEMORATE AND REMEMBER THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. ARMENIANS THAT WERE KILLED DURING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE. PLEASE JOIN US IN SUPPORTING HR THIRTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER LEVIN MISTER NAZARIAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. IS YOU ARE THIRTY SEVEN COMMEMORATES A HUNDRED AND THIRD ANNIVERSARY. OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE AND CALLS UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FORMALLY. CONSISTENTLY REAFFIRMED THE HISTORICAL TRUTH THAT THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AGAINST THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE CONSTITUTED GENOCIDE. THIS RESOLUTION PACE HOMMAGE TO THE ONE AND A HALF MILLION VICTIMS. THAT WERE SYSTEMICALLY KILLED AT THE HANDS OF THE OTTOMAN TURKISH EMPIRE. THEN THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. MEMBERS I DON'T FEEL A MORAL OBLIGATION TO COMMEMORATE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY ETHNICALLY ARMENIAN. GENOCIDE AFFECTS MORE THAN JUST THE VICTIMS. IT TRANSCENDS AND CARRIES THROUGH TO IMPACT GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. IT IS A HUMANISTIC FEATURE WHICH POUNDS OF SALT. COLLECTIVELY WE CARRY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND CALL OUT IN JUST THIS WHEN WE SEE IT. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ONE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S HARD TO CAPTURE WHAT THAT NUMBER REALLY MEANS. PRIOR TO THE GENOCIDE THERE WERE TWO MILLION ARMENIANS LIVING IN THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. WITHIN A SHORT TIME. THREE QUARTERS OF AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION PERISHED. THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES DESTROYED ONE AND A HALF MILLION PARENTS SONS AND DAUGHTERS GONE AN ANCIENT LINEAGE. NEARLY WAS OBLITERATED. COLLEAGUES IT IS TIME TO SAY NEVER FORGET. BUT IT'S CRUCIAL TO TELL THE STORIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THOSE WHO. WITNESS THE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. THE FRENCH WRITER MILAN KUNDERA WROTE. STRUGGLE OF MAN AGAINST POWER IS THE STRUGGLE OF MEMORY AGAINST FOR GETTING. THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE AND TURKEY AT THE TIME. MISTER HENRY MORGENTHAU. WITNESS THESE ATROCITIES AND URGE THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT TO INTERVENE. HE OUTLINED A CHILLING DETAILS. AND SAID THE FOLLOWING HOMES WERE LITERALLY UPROOTED MEN KILLED WOMEN AND GIRLS VIOLATED. DAILY. HE CONTINUED TO EXPLAIN HOW ORDERS WERE GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S OF PROVINCES TO SEND INTO EXILE. THE ENTIRE ARMENIAN POPULATION IRRESPECTIVE OF AGE AND SEX. CHILDREN WERE THROWN INTO THE RIVERS. IN REFLECTING ON THE WORLD'S FAILURE TO ACT DECISIVELY AGAINST THE GENOCIDE. HE ASKED. WILL DEFINITELY STEPS THE PROBABLY TAKEN TO RESCUE PERMANENTLY THE REMNANTS OF THESE FINE OLD CIVILIZED. PEOPLE FROM TURKS. HUNDRED YEARS LATER WE'RE STILL ASKING SIMILAR QUESTIONS IN THAT VERY SAME REGION. CHANGE THE PLAYERS. IN FACT IT WAS AMBASSADOR MORGENTHAU'S PERSONAL TELEGRAM TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN WASHINGTON. IN SEPTEMBER NINETEEN FIFTEEN THAT SPARKED THE AMERICAN LED RELIEF CAMPAIGN. WHICH WAS NOTED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MONTEBELLO. THE NEAR EASTERN RELIEF WHICH HELP SAVE MORE THAN MILLION ARMENIAN LIVES. AND OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ORPHANS WERE FOUND ALL THROUGHOUT THE DESERT'S AND THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY RECREATED THE ARMENIAN STATE. I CAN'T HELP BUT TO REMEMBER TO POINT AND WORDS OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. WHEN HE SO ACCURATELY STATED IN THE END WE WILL REMEMBER NOT THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES. BUT THE SILENCE OF OUR FRIENDS. RESPECT THE FIGHT THAT IS SEND THIS BACK BEFORE DESPITE THE FACT THAT A CENTURY. HAS PASSED SINCE THIS HORRIFIC CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. MANY. OUR SPEAKING UP AND ON BEHALF OF THE JOBS JUST BECAUSE OF ARMENIANS. THE ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE INABILITY TO HEAL WOUNDS. ABOUT THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE ABOUT MANKIND'S INDIFFERENCE TO THE UNSPEAKABLE SUFFERING OF AN INNOCENT PEOPLE. THEY'RE SPEAKING ABOUT DENIAL. FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD FROM EUROPE TO ASIA TO AMERICA THEY SPEAKING ABOUT DENIAL. POPE FRANCIS SAID IT BEST WHEN HE STATED CONCEALING OR DENYING EVIL IS LIKE ALLOWING A WOUND. I KEEP BLEEDING WITHOUT BANDAGING IT. THE MESSAGE HAS NEVER BEEN CLEAR. STATEMENTS STATEMENTS SUCH AS THESE REPRESENT WHAT ARMENIANS HAVEN'T TOURED SINCE NINETEEN FIFTEEN. AT THE COST OF GENOCIDE DENIAL. THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE PERPETRATORS OF THIS HEINOUS ATROCITY TO ACCEPT THEIR PAST. AND BEGIN THE SLOW PAINFUL PROCESS OF HEALING. THE PROCESS BEGINS WITH CALLING WHAT OCCURRED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO BY ITS NAME. GENOCIDE. THE LEADERS OF TURKEY TODAY DENY THAT GENOCIDE EVER TOOK PLACE. BY ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL THE TRUTH AND BY CONTINUING TO USE RHETORIC THAT SUGGEST THEY ARE UNWILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THEIR BLOODY PAST IT IS CLEAR THEY INTEND TO CARRY ON THE SAME APPROACH FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS. UNTIL AND UNLESS THE ARE PRESSURED TO COME TO TERMS WITH THEIR HISTORY OPENLY AND HONESTLY. WHEN PRETTY PRESIDENT ERDOGAN CONDEMNED THE POPE'S STATEMENT. A FEW YEARS AGO. AND WARNED HIM NOT TO MAKE SIMILAR MISTAKES AGAIN. IS THE HEAD OF A STATE. SPOKE VOLUMES ABOUT TURKEY'S PLANS TO ACCEPT ITS OWN HISTORY AND THE COUNTRY'S PLANS FOR GENUINE RECONCILIATION. I JUST LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE WORDS OF A SILLY GROSSMAN A SURVIVOR WHO LOST HIS MOTHER DURING THE HOLOCAUST. I HAVE SEEN THAT IT IS NOT MAN WHO IS IMPOTENT. IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST EVIL. BUT THE POWER OF EVIL. THAT IS IMPOTENT IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MEN. POWERLESSNESS OF KINDNESS OF SENSELESS KINDNESS. IS THE SECRET OF ITS IMMORTALITY. IT CAN NEVER BE CONQUERED. HUMAN HISTORY IS NOT THE BATTLE OF GOOD STRUGGLING OVER TO OVERCOME EVIL. IT IS A BATTLE FOUGHT BY A GREAT EVIL. STRUGGLING TO CRUSH A SMALL KERNEL. OF HUMAN KINDNESS. BUT IF WHAT IS HUMAN IN HUMAN BEINGS HAS NOT BEEN DESTROYED EVEN NOW. THEN EVIL WILL NEVER CONQUER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK VERY AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER NAZARIAN. ALL DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED ON THE RESOLUTION. FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH.

HE WAS ALWAYS WARM AND WELCOMING AND GENUINE VERY VERY GENUINE. HE WAS A MASTER COMMUNICATOR AND STORY TELLER. HIS WAY OF ROPING YOU IN AND TAKING YOU FOR A JOURNEY WHATEVER HE SPOKE MADE HIM ONE OF OUR MOST INCLUSIVE LEADERS. HIT A REALLY DARK SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH I ALWAYS APPRECIATED. AND. THIS OF VERY MUCH LOVED IN THE BURBANK COMMUNITY. WILL MOVE TO LOS ANGELES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND WORK AS AN ACTOR IN A WRITER FOR THE LA WEEKLY AND SEVERAL OTHER PUBLICATIONS. HE CONTINUED HIS CAREER IN JOURNALISM AS A COLUMNIST FOR THE BURBANK LEADER AND RECEIVED SEVERAL AWARDS FROM THE CALIFORNIA NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. HE THEN DECIDED TO RUN FOR CITY COUNCIL. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT CITY COUNCILS. WHAT PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT THEM AND COVER THEM BUT HOW MANY JOURNALISTS YOU KNOW? AFTER COVERING A CITY COUNCIL DECIDE TO TAKE THE PLUNGE AND PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE. AND RUN FOR THAT COUNCIL BUT WILL DID THAT I DON'T EVER FORGET THAT I WAS ABLE TO MODERATE A FORUM IN WHICH HE WAS A CANDIDATE AND HE ALWAYS MODERATED FORUMS IN GLENDALE FOR THE CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES. WHEN I WAS A CANDIDATE MYSELF MY VERY FIRST CITY COUNCIL RACE HE WOULD ASK THESE REALLY HARD QUESTIONS AT OUR MEMBERS SITTING THERE THINKING. IF THIS GUY ONLY KNEW IT WAS REALLY LIKE TO BE A LOCAL OFFICE HE WOULDN'T ASK THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS I CAN'T TELL YOU. HOW ARE WE GOING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN ONE MINUTE? SO WHEN I GOT TO MODERATE HIS FORM I REALLY HAD FUN ASKING HIM ALL THOSE SAME HARD QUESTIONS. AND AFTERWARDS HE WALKED UP TO ME AND HE SAID. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN RUNNING I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHEN I USED TO MODERATE THOSE FORMS AND HOW UNFAIR THOSE QUESTIONS WERE NOW THAT I'M DOING IT MYSELF. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU CANDIDATES GO THROUGH AND IF I WAS GOING TO GO BACK AND DO JOURNALISM AGAIN I DO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND HOW I COVERED THE CITY COUNCIL ON THE CANDIDATES. IT WAS REALLY WONDERFUL THAT HE WAS ABLE TO HAVE THAT JOURNEY IN HIS CAREER BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT. SO IT WAS SUCH A JOY WHEN HE WON HIS CITY COUNCIL RACE AND BECAME THE MAYOR. HE WAS MY FRIEND HE WAS A ROLE MODEL HE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ME. THE CRAP PASSING OF WILL REALLY HURTS ME AND I KNOW IT HURT SO MANY IN THE BURBANK COMMUNITY. BUT I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE ALL HAD TO KNOW HIM.
