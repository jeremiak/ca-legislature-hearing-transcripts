REQUIREMENT THAT LEAD CANDIDATES

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:45.203 region:rollup2

STATE UP INTO ELEVEN REGIONS UM

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.452 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND WE I'M NOT SURE

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:57.020 region:rollup2
HOW MANY REASONS WE HAD THERE

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:58.922 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO HAD WHAT WE CALLED

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.523 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S. WHICH ARE

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:01.425 region:rollup2
BUSY NAY THE COULD BE

00:55:59.523 --> 00:56:02.793 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONS WE USE THE LA URBAN

00:56:01.425 --> 00:56:04.962 region:rollup2
LEAGUE FOR EXAMPLE DOWN IN LOS

00:56:02.793 --> 00:56:06.530 region:rollup2
ANGELES IS A REALLY COMMUNITY

00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:08.532 region:rollup2
ENGINE NGOS COMING ORGANIZATIONS

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:09.867 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE CAPACITY. TO REACH

00:56:08.532 --> 00:56:10.701 region:rollup2
INTO THE AUDIENCE.

00:56:09.867 --> 00:56:12.569 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REACH HER

00:56:10.701 --> 00:56:13.670 region:rollup2
TO COMPETITIONS BUT THEY WILL BE

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:15.272 region:rollup2
DOING PRETTY MUCH THE

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.440 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE TASK OF

00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:18.475 region:rollup2
MONITORING.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.811 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT THE ANA

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:21.345 region:rollup2
BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE DOING

00:56:20.811 --> 00:56:26.717 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE SAY THERE SAY

00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:28.118 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING.

00:56:26.717 --> 00:56:29.820 region:rollup2
PERHAPS IT WOULD JUST COUPLE OR

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:30.454 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS COME HOW CAN WE ENSURE

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.021 region:rollup2
THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

00:56:30.454 --> 00:56:33.457 region:rollup2
CENSUS. IS IN PLACE BY NEXT

00:56:31.021 --> 00:56:35.158 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:56:33.457 --> 00:56:36.894 region:rollup2

00:56:35.158 --> 00:56:38.395 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS A

00:56:36.894 --> 00:56:39.830 region:rollup2
CONTINGENT THEIR APPOINTMENTS AS

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:42.065 region:rollup2

POSTING THOSE.

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:46.003 region:rollup2
RIGHT AWAY IN TERMS OF WE HAVE

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.537 region:rollup2
TO GO THROUGH THE CAL H. ARE

00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:47.905 region:rollup2
HIRING PROCESS.

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:49.873 region:rollup2

NO QUESTIONS JUST JUST COMMENTS

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:02.586 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS PARTICULAR CENSUS

00:57:00.851 --> 00:57:03.120 region:rollup2
CYCLE IS GOING TO BE MORE

00:57:02.586 --> 00:57:04.888 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT THAN IN PREVIOUS

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.857 region:rollup2

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:08.959 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO CAUTION THAT BOND

00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:11.695 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IN IN IN

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:12.262 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT IS THAT. BECAUSE OF

00:57:11.695 --> 00:57:12.829 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT

00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:15.232 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:17.167 region:rollup2
.

00:57:15.232 --> 00:57:18.602 region:rollup2
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD AND

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:19.970 region:rollup2
MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS.

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:21.171 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO ANSWER

00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.439 region:rollup2
DOORS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY

00:57:21.171 --> 00:57:25.309 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OUT AND.

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:27.377 region:rollup2
TO BE VERY WARY OF ANYBODY

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:29.179 region:rollup2
COMING ASKING FOR INFORMATION SO

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:30.781 region:rollup2

00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:33.050 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:34.351 region:rollup2
GETTING GOOD ANSWERS AND PART OF

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.053 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE IN THE REGION AS

00:57:34.351 --> 00:57:37.454 region:rollup2
WELL IS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE

00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:38.822 region:rollup2
FAMILIES LIVING IN ONE BEDROOM

00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:40.824 region:rollup2

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:36.626 region:rollup2
LOSE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE ON

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:38.027 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LEVEL. CALIFORNIANS

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:39.429 region:rollup2

ENOUGH FUNDING THE STATE SHOULD

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:52.075 region:rollup2
AND NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE

01:06:50.273 --> 01:06:53.142 region:rollup2

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:55.411 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PROPOSED.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:57.046 region:rollup2

ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:25.701 region:rollup2
