OF VOTERS- THERE'S A BASIC

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:14.251
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL AND THAT

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.320
IS THIS IDEA THAT GREATER

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:18.655

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:22.793
PRIMARIES. IN MY VIEW THE EXACT

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.962
OPPOSITE IS TRUE. IN THE

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.498

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.304
ON THE BALLOT WHICH IS HOUSE OF

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:51.655
POINT 7% THAT'S 35% INCREASE IN

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.257
DROP OFF HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:55.225
FACT THAT ALL OF THE VOTERS

00:44:55.292 --> 00:44:57.127

PRIMARY EVEN MORE COMPLICATED

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:18.282

STATEWIDE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY

00:45:23.687 --> 00:45:25.556

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.228
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.930
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH- WE

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.365
HEARD THE THIRD TO THE

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:57.701
REGISTRAR FROM THE COUNTY. OF

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.969
NAFTA TALK ABOUT THE DROP OFF

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:01.471
RATE- IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT IN

00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:03.473
PRESIDENTIAL RACES. YET THE

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.608
COST OF RUNNING IN A

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:05.776
PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS

00:49:05.842 --> 00:49:08.578
DRAMATICALLY HIGHER- BECAUSE OF

00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:10.080
THE POTENTIAL AT LEAST FOR A

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:12.049
GREATER PARTICIPATION WHICH ON%

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.583
ONE HAND IS A GOOD THING. ON

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:14.384
THE OTHER HAND IT'S BALANCED

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.486
OUT BY SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:17.254
THOSE WHO WANT TO GET THEIR

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.222
MESSAGES OUT. AT NOT JUST IN

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.991
TERMS OF A COST. PERSPECTIVE

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.826
BUT ALSO FROM THE IS GETTING

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.194
THE ATTENTION OF THE VOTERS TO

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.830
THAT CONTEST ITSELF. AS WE KNOW

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.465
IN THESE PRESIDENTIAL RACES

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.567
IT'S KINDA SUCKS THE OXYGEN.

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.902
OUT OF THE ROOM FOR A LOT OF

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.603
THAT. REPORTING THAT WOULD LIKE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.272
TO SEE EITHER ONLINE OR

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:36.907
BROADCAST MEDIA FOR SOME OF THE

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:39.476
OTHER RACES THAT WE ARE-

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:42.779
FOLLOWING. SO WITH THAT I- WITH

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.915
ALL RESPECT I'M NOT GOING TO

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.016
JOINING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.117
BILL TODAY I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.118
HAVE THE VOTES TO MOVE THE BILL

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:50.454
FURTHER. FORWARD IN ANY CASE

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.388
AND THAT'S THAT'S PERFECTLY

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:52.856
FINE BUT I DID WANT TO RAISE

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.758
THOSE ISSUES- WITH YOU IF YOU

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.560
WISH TO ADDRESSING YOU CAN'T WE

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.862
CAN GO TO OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.764
COMMENTS. YEAH I'D AM WELL

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.232
THANK YOU FOR RAISING THOSE

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:03.533
ISSUES AND I DID WANT TO

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.768
ADDRESS THAT THE OP THE

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.237
OPPOSITION. THE TWO LATER

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:09.740
CALLS- WERE SIMILAR TO THEM THE

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:11.708
MAIN UPON IT AND ALL DRESSED

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:12.676
THAT HIS HIS THREE ISSUES AS

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:15.445
WELL. AS AS YOU KNOW THE TAX

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.347
COLLECTORS AND THE OTHER COUNTY

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:18.448
OFFICES OTHER THAN SHERIFF AND

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:20.550
DA. THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE

00:50:20.617 --> 00:50:21.818
PART OF THE BILL SO I THINK

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:24.354
THOSE. ARE A BIT MOVE ON ON THE

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.089
ISSUE AS FAR AS HAVING A DROP

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:28.225
OFF. IN THE PRESIDENTIAL A

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.726
CERTAINLY THERE IS BUT I WOULD

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.995
ARGUE THAT EVEN THE DROP OFF.

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:34.030
WITH THE DROP OFF IS STILL FAR

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:34.631
GREATER POLITICAL

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:37.167
PARTICIPATION. ESPECIALLY AMONG

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:38.235
OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.137
HAVING IT. IN THE GUBERNATORIAL

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:43.006
YEAR AND THEN AS FAR AS- THE

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.641
PRIMARY VERSES THE GENERAL THAT

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:45.675
WOULD BE THE SAME WAY WHETHER

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.611
IT'S IN. A PRESIDENTIAL

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:51.214
ELECTION OR A- FOR I DO

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:53.016
MAJORITY OVER SAYS THE PRIMARY.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:54.050
THERE'S ONLY TWO CANDIDATES

00:50:54.117 --> 00:50:56.586
GOING ON. ONTO THE GENERAL SO I

00:50:56.653 --> 00:50:58.522
DO THINK THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED-

00:50:58.588 --> 00:51:01.858
SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. AND THEN-

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:04.027
A- THE MAIN CONCERNS WE HEARD

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.462
THERE THEY WILL BE ADDRESSED

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.863
THE NEXT COMMITTEE ONLY ONLY

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.434
FOCUSING ON. THE TOP TWO ISSUES

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.401

POSITIONS AT ISSUE HERE DA AND

WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT

00:54:04.608 --> 00:54:07.777

INFLUENCE ON THIS PLACE. AND

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:16.219
BOND THERE WAS EXTRAORDINARY

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:19.322
CORRUPTION AND THIS WAS A WAY

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.725
TO GIVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:24.027
POWER TO THE PEOPLE TO OVERTURN

00:54:24.094 --> 00:54:25.862
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES.

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:26.796
WOULD YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.998
HAPPENED THE LAST NUMBER OF

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.566
YEARS WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.767
INITIATIVE PROCESS WITH

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.035
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.237
BEING SPENT BY OUTSIDE INTEREST

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:35.505
GROUPS WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:37.774
REFERENDUM PROCESS. SIMILAR

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.075
KIND OF A THING HAPPENING IF

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:40.977
YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.779
PAT BROWN INSTITUTE BOOK IT'LL

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.881
SHOW YOU THAT JUST VISTA

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.216
HANDFUL WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:47.584
TOTAL NUMBER OF INITIATIVES FOR

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.052
EXAMPLE THE REFERENCED

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.587
APPROPRIATELY IN YOUR ANALYSIS.

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:52.322
VERY FEW IN THE EARLY YEARS AND

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:54.724
THEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.726
NINETY NINE IT WAS FORTY FOUR

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.828
AT OVER FORTY S. SIXTY ONE. TO

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:01.831
pNEXT NUMBER OF SIXTY ONE OF THE

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:02.666
NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS THE BOTTOM

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.501
LINE IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:06.503
MOVEMENT AFOOT. BY OUTSIDE

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:07.671
INTEREST GROUPS AS WE HAVE MORE

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.105
TELEVISION MORE ABILITY TO

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:11.775
INFLUENCE THE PROCESS TO

00:55:11.841 --> 00:55:15.211
DRAMATICALLY UP USE THIS TOOL

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:17.747
THAT WAS INITIALLY INTENDED TO

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.015
GIVE POWER TO THE PEOPLE AND

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:21.151
NOW IT'S EXCEPT THE APT IMPACT

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:22.986
IS EXACTLY OPPOSITE AND

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:26.723
REFERENDUMS. ARE PARTICULARLY

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:28.058
TROUBLESOME. BECAUSE THE IN

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.325
THIS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.594
TO IN THIS MEASURE. IS THAT THE

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.496
LEGISLATURE TAKES AN ACTION.

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:34.998
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR PASSED

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:37.000
BY BOTH HOUSES. AND THEN ALL OF

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:38.134
A SUDDEN INTEREST GROUP COMES

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.502
ALONG AND SAYS WE DON'T LIKE

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.804
THE OUTCOME WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.738
WRITE A CHECK AND CHANGE THE

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.973
GAME. WE SEE IT NOW COMING UP

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.442
ON THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:45.508 --> 00:55:46.743
TWO BALLOT WITH TOBACCO.

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:47.911
THEY'RE SEEKING TO REFERENDUM

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:50.013
CENTRE HILLS MEASURE SB SEVEN

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.114
NINETY THREE. THEY'VE ALREADY

00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:52.582
RAISED TWENTY ONE POINT ONE

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:53.983
MILLION TEN MILLION DOLLARS A

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.152
LOAN FROM RJ REYNOLDS. IS THAT

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:58.955
THE WAY TO GOVERN. IT YOU START

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:00.156
WITH THE INDIAN GAMING SOME

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.357
YEARS AGO I WAS INVOLVED IN

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:03.293
THAT ONE IS PRIVATE LAWYER WE

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.627
SEEDED IT WITH RESPECT TO

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.529
PODERES AND DALY OWNS IN LARGE

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:10.967
MEASURE ON. IN AND PROP SIXTY

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.168
SEVEN IN IN TWO THOUSAND

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.703
SIXTEEN. WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.971
THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:17.874
CORRECT HERE. CERTAINLY BURKE

00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:19.409
THE REFERENDUM IS AN IMPORTANT

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:21.077
ELEMENT WHICH BASICALLY SAYS

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:24.481
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MECHANISM

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:25.682
TO WILL BE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:27.517
OVERTURN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.651
DOES A FAIR AND APPROPRIATE

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.987
POWER BUT IT HAS TO BE

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:33.690
EXERCISED IN A MANNER. THAT IS

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.925
FAIR AND WHAT'S HAPPENED AND

00:56:35.992 --> 00:56:37.393
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT IN

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.028
THIS MEASURE ARE TOO THANKS.

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:41.231
IT'S CONFUSING BECAUSE WHEN

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:43.533
SOME VOTER COMES ALONG AND

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.601
VOTES FOR YES OR NO ON THE

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:46.569
BALLOT SUPPORT TO UNDERSTAND

00:56:46.636 --> 00:56:48.538
THE CONTEXT THE VOTING YES OR

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:49.873
NO ON ALL THE INITIATIVES AND

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:51.207
THEN THEY HAVE A FLIPPED.

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:52.942
RESPONSIBLE YES MEANS WHAT A NO

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.244
MEANS WITH RESPECT TO A

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.045
REFERENDUM IT'S QUITE CONFUSING

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:58.248
SO CONFUSING THAT I GOT CALLS

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.716
AND STREAM IMPORTANT ELECTED

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:01.251
OFFICIALS WHO TOLD ME THEY

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.051
THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD VOTED ON

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.753
A MEASURE ONE WAY THE NAY VOTE

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.687
ANOTHER BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:05.688
DO YOU ESTIMATE I WOULDN'T

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.690
MATTER. SECOND UNDER THE

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.092
CONSTITUTION THE WAY THE

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.727
ORDERING HAPPENS IS THAT

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.362
REFERENDUMS AT THE BOTTOM WOULD

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.330
YOU WE CLEARLY KNOW IN THIS

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.632
LAST ELECTION OVER A MILLION

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.267
PEOPLE WHO VOTED THE TOP OF THE

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.002
BALLOT. DROPPED OFF BECAUSE

00:57:19.068 --> 00:57:22.539
VOTER FATIGUE AND INVOLVED THE

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.106
BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT. BUT IF

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.240
EVERY OTHER CON. IT'S PUT IN

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:27.610
ORDER OF QUALIFICATION. SO YOU

00:57:27.677 --> 00:57:28.511
KNOW HAVE THEM IF YOU DON'T%

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:29.579
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.514
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR IN THE

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.783
L. DULY ELECTED IN THE ENDEAVOR

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.351
TO WHO ARE BEING ELECTED AND

00:57:35.418 --> 00:57:37.086
THEN YOU HAVE A PROCESS THAT IS

00:57:37.153 --> 00:57:38.855
COMPLETELY RIGGED IN THE SENSE

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:41.224
OF BOTH CONFUSION. AND VOTER

00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.126
FATIGUE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.994
DO HERE IS TO CHANGE THAT

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.062
PROCESS TO PUT IN A LEVEL

00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:47.697
PLAYING FIELD NO ONE'S TAKING

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:50.733
AWAY THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.702
THE REFERENDA SOMETHING WE'RE

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:54.637
TRYING TO DO ESPECIALLY NOW

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:55.839
WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:57.740
THESE REFERENDUMS COMING ALONG

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:58.708
A TO OVERTURN WITH THE

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.243
LEGISLATURE DOZEN I WOULD

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.711
SUGGEST IT'S BECAUSE THE YOU

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:04.414
KNOW. THERE'S THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.316
IS COULD IS MORE CONTROLLED BY

00:58:06.382 --> 00:58:09.686
ONE PARTY VERSUS ANOTHER AND

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.020
THAT HAPPENS. AND SO. BUT

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:11.788
THAT'S A REFLECTION OF THE

00:58:11.855 --> 00:58:13.489
PEOPLE THAT THE REDISTRICTING

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:14.657
IS DONE IN THE DISTRICTS ARE

00:58:14.724 --> 00:58:16.492
CHOSEN. NOT BY SOME

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.361
GERRYMANDERING PROCESS BUT BY A

00:58:18.428 --> 00:58:19.729
COMPLETELY NONPARTISAN FAIR

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.731
PROCESS AND JUST REFLECTS WHO

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:23.666
WE ARE AS A STATE WE CAN LIKE

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:24.834
IT OR NOT LIKE IT. BUT IT

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.603
REFLECTS WHO WE ARE AS A STATE.

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.503
SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.305
CURRENT SYSTEM IS RIGGED. IN

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:32.976
THE IN IN THAT IT IT IS TOTALLY.

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.978
AGAINST AT THE FAIR APPROACH IT

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:37.814
CREATES A PROCESS. WHERE A YES

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:38.715
AND EVERY OTHER INITIATIVE

00:58:38.781 --> 00:58:40.049
YOU'RE GOING DOWN THE LIST YOU

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.751
GET TO THE END AND IT FLIPS.

00:58:41.818 --> 00:58:42.986
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT IT OUT OF

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.754
CONTEXT NOW. JUST LATE

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.222
OPPOSITION BY THE CALCHAMBER

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:49.359
SAYS. IT CITES A CASE CALLED

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.860
STRAUSS FOR HIS HORTON. WELL

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.128
WHEN BOB HERTZBERG NAY THEY

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:53.363
GIVE THIS TO ME AT THE LAST

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:54.430
MINUTE I OF COURSE READ THE

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:55.665
CASE. BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.467
WHAT IT SAYS IS IT SUPPORTING

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.102
THEIR POSITION. AND BASICALLY

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:00.036
THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THIS

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:02.372
DOESN'T CONSTITUTE A REVISION.

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.674
BUT THAT THIS CONSTITUTES A- A

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.309
FAR REACHING CHANGE THE NATURE

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.810
OF OUR BASIC GOVERNMENT PLAN.

00:59:07.877 --> 00:59:10.947
WE LOOK AT THAT CASE AND THAT

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.015
CASE DEALT WITH PROPOSITION.

00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:13.283
EIGHT IN IN IN SAME SEX

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:14.951
MARRIAGES. AND WHAT THE COURT

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.520
SAYS IN THAT IS SPECIFICALLY A

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.888
CHANGE IN THE COST IN THE

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.957
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. IS

00:59:21.024 --> 00:59:22.959
REVISION ONLY IF IT INVOLVES A

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:23.726
CHANGE THAT IS SUCH FAR

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:25.361
REACHING SCOPE. THAT IT

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:27.163
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.364
RELATION OF GOVERNMENT IN THIS

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:30.333
CASE VESTS ALL JUDICIAL POWER

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.034
IN THAT CASE IN THE

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.835
LEGISLATURE. THAT IS NOT

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:35.204
HAPPENING HERE AND TO ME YOU

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.973
KNOW IT'S A LITTLE UNFAIR IN

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.274
TERMS OF WHOEVER WROTE THAT

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:40.043
LETTER. TO BE ABLE TO CHEN WILL

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.177
MAYBE THE LAST GIVEN THEIR

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.046
OPPOSITION TO TRY TO MAKE THAT

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:44.247
ARGUMENT BY THROWING A CASE

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.282
THAT'S ALREADY OUT TO. WHICH IS

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:47.984
WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BUT

00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:48.785
RATHER THAN LOOKING AT THE

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:50.420
DETAILS OF THE CASE. YOUR

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.921
ANALYSIS CITES A CASE WHICH IS

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:53.823
CONSISTENT WITH. AN APPROPRIATE

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:55.658
WITH RESPECT TO. THE POINT THAT

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:56.859
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE WITH THE

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:57.627
IS THIS SHOULD BE A

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:58.861
CONSTITUTIONAL AS OPPOSED TO

00:59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.596
THE STATUTORY APPROACH. TO

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.298
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. YES YES

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.901
AND SO. I JUST I JUST THINK

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.736
THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING. HOW

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.604
CRITICAL IT IS.AND AT THE END

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.874
OF THE DAY WOULD HAVE CA DOES

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.910
IS JUST SAY. WITH RESPECT. THE

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:16.279
REFERENDUM PROCESS. LET'S JUST

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.214
MAKE IT FAIR SO YES IS A YES

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.782
AND NO IS A NO CONSISTENT WITH

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.617
ALL THE OTHER VOTES THAT WE ASK

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:24.253
VOTERS. AND TO. PUT IN THE

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.923
ORDER. OF HOW THEY QUALIFY JUST

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.791
LIKE ANYBODY ELSE RATHER THAN

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.760
PUTTING. A REFERENDUM WHICH IS

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.495
AGAIN THIS IS NOT SOME PIE IN

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.262
THE SKY I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.197
VETTED TO THE ENTIRE

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.965

CHILLING EFFECT A WEAPONIZING A

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.274
FACT I WOULD ARGUE. AGAINST THE

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.477
POWER OF THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT

SCA ONE IN ADDITION TO ITS- ITS

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:59.135
OWN CHANGES BRINGS A CHANGE THE

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.903
ELECTION CODE FOUND IN SB FOUR

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.071
FORTY THREE. WHICH IS

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.673
CONTINGENT ON SCA ONE PASSING

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.007
THIS MAY APPEAR AS A TECHNICAL

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.409
CHANGE THE STATURE BUT THE

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:07.410
REASONING BEHIND THE SUGGESTION

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:08.744
IS UNSETTLING BECAUSE IN THIS

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:10.313
BILL IT TENDS TO SUGGEST

01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:11.047
DEVOTED TO ONE THING OVER

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:13.916
ANOTHER- SB FOUR FORTY THREE

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:14.750
THREATS IS ONE PASSAGE WOULD

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.419
CHANGE THE LANGUAGE ON BALLOTS

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.353
TO REMOVE THE WORD REJECTED OR

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.988
ADOPTED AND LEAVE THE VOTERS

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.223
THE CHOICE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.191
THEY WOULD MERELY REJECT ITEMS

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:23.092
THE WORD REJECTED COMES WITH A

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:24.727
NEGATIVE CONNOTATION AND

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:25.861
LEAVING IT ON THE PAGE ALONG

01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:26.929
WITHOUT A BOUNCING TERM LIKE

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.364
ADOPTED CREATES AN IMPLIED

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.032
SUGGESTION BY THE STATE.

01:04:30.099 --> 01:04:32.235
VISUALLY THE TERM REJECTED ON

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.569
THE PAGE ALONE LEAVES A MUCH

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.570
STRONGER NEGATIVE CONNOTATION

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.838
IN THE MIND OF A VOTER THAT CAN

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.440
DISCOURAGE VOTERS FROM ACTING

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:38.741
BEFORE REMOVING BOTH CHOICES

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.209
FROM THE EYES OF THE VOTER IT

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:41.510
SHOULD BE STUDY TO DETERMINE

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:46.415
HOW THIS AFFECTS A PERSON'S.

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:47.049
WILLINGNESS TO VOTE. ONE WAY OR

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:47.984
ANOTHER. SUCH A CHANGE TO THE

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.652
WAY VOTERS. OP A LITTLE ON THE-

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.187
TOWARD OUR OPTIONS NOT READ-

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.788
THE ULTIMATE POINT OF FAIRNESS

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.257
ON OUR ELECTIONS. SB FORTY

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.592
THREE. HOWEVER I SUGGEST THAT.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.994
REQUIRES THAT AS A ONE GAME

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.630
PASSAGE FIRST. SO IN ADDITION

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:01.197
TO GIVING OPERATIVE WIFE HAS

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:03.299
BEFORE FORTY THREE. SB ONE WILL

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.500
REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF NEW

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.002
LEGALISTIC DESCRIPTIONS TO THE

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.570
BALLOT WHICH IN ADDITION TO ALL

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.238
OTHER INFORMATION PRINTED.

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:11.007
STATES THAT A YES VOTE. IS IN

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.108
FAVOR OF THE REFERENDUM AND

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:13.576
REJECTS THE STATUTE OR PART OF

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.543
THE STATUTES SUBJECT TO THE

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.045
REFERENDUM IN A NO VOTE. IS

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:17.580
AGAINST THE REFERENDUM. AND

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:18.914

STATUTES SUBJECT TO THE

01:05:19.882 --> 01:05:21.951
REFERENDUM. THIS IS. UNUSUAL

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.352
BECAUSE A REFERENDUM BY ITS

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.054
NATURE CALLS. FOR THE REJECTION

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:25.955
OF A STATUTE OR PART OF THE

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:27.556
STATURE. THE RISK IS GREATER

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:28.391
WHEN LOOKING AT THE WAY IN

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:29.692

PROBABLY GOING TO BE REAL TOUGH

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:34.477
ON THIS- BUT I JUST THINK IT'S

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.045
AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO.

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:37.346
DETERMINE WHAT THE FOREGOING

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.514
REASONS AREN'T WITH THE

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:41.250
FOREGOING REASONS AREN'T I'M

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.719
CERTAIN IF I HAD COME UP WITH-

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.921
THE RIVER AT THE WAY TO MODIFY

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.090
THIS IN A IN A WAY THAT WOULD

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:48.858
DEAL WITH THE REASONS THEY

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:50.726
SUGGESTED THEY WOULD STILL

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:51.527
OPPOSE THAT HAPPENS A LOT IN

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.962
THIS BUSINESS WHERE PEOPLE GIVE

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.129
YOU A SERIES OF RACES BUT

01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:54.897
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO COME

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.765
ALONG. AND THE REASON OR NOT IS

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.701
THAT THE PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.969
THIS ARE THEIR MEMBERSHIP I

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:02.171
DON'T BEGRUDGE THAT THEY SHOULD

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.340
ARGUE FOR THE MEMBERSHIP I JUST

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.774
DON'T THINK THAT THOSE INTEREST

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:08.677
GROUPS SHOULD CREATE THIS

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:10.813
WEAPONIZING ON LEVEL PLAYING

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.680

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.016
THAT WAS MADE- I WHO HAS A

01:09:14.083 --> 01:09:14.984
QUESTION BUT IT'S REALLY IS

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.585
COUNTERINTUITIVE IF YOU'RE

REFERENDUM AND INITIATIVE IS

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:25.928
