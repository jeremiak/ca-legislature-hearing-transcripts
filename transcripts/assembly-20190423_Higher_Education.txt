SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR MAKING SURE THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A ITEM. SIXTEEN AB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible] SIX GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS -- ME HERE TODAY TO PRESENT TO YOU A. B.. FOURTEEN SIXTY THE ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENTS -- SEE ISSUE EDUCATES THE MOST ETHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AN ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE STUDENT BODY IN THE NATION. AND THAT DIVERSITY SHOULD BE CELEBRATED BY THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF A CURRICULUM THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND REFLECTIVE OF THE STUDENT CULTURES AND BACKGROUNDS A SERVER. ETHNIC STUDIES SCHOLARSHIP FOCUSES ON THE CENTRAL ROLE THAT RACE AND ETHNICITY PLAY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AMERICAN HISTORY CULTURE AND SOCIETY. PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE STRUCTURAL CONTENTS OF POWER. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCES OFFICE LAUNCHED A TASK FORCE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF ETHNIC STUDIES COMPRISED OF FACULTY DEPARTMENT CHAIRS PROGRAM DIRECTORS COORDINATORS DEAN'S ACADEMIC SENATE CHEERS. AND PRESIDENT FROM THE C. ISSUE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TASK FORCE FINAL REPORT WAS TO MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENT THROUGHOUT THE CSU SYSTEM. IN ADDITION THE REPORT EMPHASIZED THE CRITICAL ROLE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES PLAY AND THE REALIZATION OF THIS ISSUE MISSION WHICH INCLUDES A GOAL TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE INTERNATIONALLY MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY. STUDIES AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE FOUND THAT BOTH STUDENTS OF COLOR AND WHITE STUDENTS BENEFIT ACADEMICALLY AND SOCIALLY FROM TAKING ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES POSITIVE CAMPUS CLIMATE OUTCOMES AND ARE VITAL TO STUDENT SUCCESS BEYOND COLLEGE IN AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE WORK FORCE IN SOCIETY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AB FOURTEEN SIXTY WAS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HISTORY THAT I'M THAT EVERY AMERICAN HISTORY IS TAUGHT. IN VALUE BY HAVING TO SEE ISSUE SYSTEM INCLUDE THE COMPLETION OF AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AS A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE ACADEMIC SENATE TO WORK WITH THIS ISSUE COUNSEL ON ETHNIC STUDIES TO DEVELOP CORE COMPETENCIES TO BE CHEEKY ****. BY STUDENTS TAKE IN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE. AB FOURTEEN SAYS SIXTY SPECIFIES THIS REQUIREMENT WOULD NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF UNITS REQUIRED TO GRADUATION. INTENT OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO INCREASE TIME TO DEGREE. THE BILL A STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT THE ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE COULD DOUBLE COUNT FOR MULTIPLE REQUIREMENTS AND IF A STUDENT TOOK AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FULFILL. THE COMMITTEE ANNA ANNA A NOT AN ANALYSIS NOTED THAT CURRENT ARTICULATED PATHWAYS TO THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE TO BE RE EXAMINED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE AND ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENTS. WE BELIEVE THE BENEFITS STUDENTS WOULD GAIN OUTWEIGHS THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF IT EXAMINING PREVIOUS PRACTICES. THIS BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBED CURRICULUM COURSE CONTENT OR STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES WHAT IS THIS BILL LIMIT FACULTY MEMBERS OUR STUDENTS ENGAGE. ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE WHATSOEVER AND THEREFORE DOES NOT INFRINGE ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE AT LAW SANDERS DEMOCRATIC PARTY SACRAMENTO STATE BE ISSUE THE S. YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BLACKS CITIES THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF LATIN AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR NIGGLE WOMEN. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB FOURTEEN SIXTY IS DOCTOR MILLION OF DO LOVE PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF PAN AFRICAN STUDIES AT CAL STATE LA. ANTOINETTE SADLER'S STUDENT CAL STATE LA. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US -- AND GREETINGS -- CHAIR MEDINA -- SO I JUST WANT TO CORRECT THAT ASIA CLOWNEY IS ACTUALLY THE STUDENT WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING -- SO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FACULTY LIBRARIANS COACHES AND COUNSELLORS. AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WHICH SERVES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IS PROFESSOR AND CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PAN AFRICAN STUDIES AT CAL STATE LA. IS A DELEGATE TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BLACK STUDIES A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. FOR ETHNIC STUDIES AND IS ONE WHOSE LIFE LIFE WAS TRANSFORMED BY BLACK STUDIES AS A STUDENT AT BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL AND LATER HOWARD UNIVERSITY -- ALSO IS AN ORGANIZER WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER IN A MEMBER OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES TASK FORCE THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER MENTIONED I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL. FOURTEEN SIXTY THE TIMES IN WHICH WE LIVE MAKE THE CALL FOR ETHNIC STUDIES WITH AN ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENTS URGENT. WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING AND EXPERIENCING IS WHITE SUPREMACY IN TERMS OF POLICY AND VIOLENCE HATE CRIMES ARE SOARING AND AS EDUCATORS AND ONE'S INVESTED IN TEACHING? OUR STATE AND THE STUDENTS IN OUR STATE TO THINK CRITICALLY AND BE AGENTS OF CHANGE WE HAVE A ROLE IN TURNING THAT TIED. WE KNOW ETHNIC STUDIES TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION. FIFTY YEARS AGO AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FACULTY AND COMMUNITY BAND TOGETHER TO DEMAND AN EDUCATION THAT SPOKE TO WHEN EMPOWERED STUDENTS OF COLOR. ETHNIC STUDIES IS MEANT TO FILL GAPS IN TERMS OF SUBJECT AREA AND KNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATIONS OF PEOPLE OF COLOR THEIR HISTORIES CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPERIENCES. BUT ETHNIC STUDIES IS ALSO MEANT TO DO MORE. WE ADOPTED DIFFERENT PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH THAT ELICITS A COAL LEARNING MODEL THAT VALUES STUDENT KNOWLEDGE AND LIVED EXPERIENCES IT ALLOWS STUDENTS OF COLOR TO ATTACH TO THE LEARNING PROCESS. A PISTOL LOGICALLY THE WAY IN WHICH WE STUDY IN WHAT WE STUDY FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP IT'S GENERATED IS MEANT TO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN TO STUDY UPON COMMUNITIES. I KNOW THAT THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND THEY CITE ACADEMIC FREEDOM. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT AND WHAT. ACADEMIC FREEDOM ACTUALLY IS. THE CONCEPT OF ACT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IS ADVOCATED MOST FIERCELY BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS WHICH I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF MEANS PRIMARILY THAT. BOTH FACULTY MEMBERS AND STUDENTS CAN ENGAGE IN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE WITHOUT FEAR OF CENSORSHIP OR RETALIATION. THAT MEANS THAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM CALLS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A BILL LIKE THIS RIGHT -- WE HAVE TWO ARTICLES FOR YOUR REVIEW THAT SPEAK TO OUR DEFINITION OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM FROM INSTITUTIONS THAT SAFEGUARD ACADEMIC FREEDOM. THIS BILL DOES NOT OUTLINE COURSE CONTENT. ON THE QUESTION OF DOES THIS BILL TRAMPLE ON ACADEMIC FREEDOM BY DIRECTING QUART COURSE MATERIALS THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING NO. FINALLY ANY CONCERN ABOUT TIME TO GRADUATION CAN BE QUICKLY ALLAYED AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER THE AUTHOR OUTLINED THIS IS A OVERLAY REQUIREMENTS IT WOULD MEAN. THAT CLASSES THAT STUDENTS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO TAKE WOULD BE TAKEN IN ETHNIC STUDIES AT LEAST ONE WOULD BE TAKEN IN ETHNIC STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE RATHER THAN TAKING ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. OKAY A STUDENT COULD TAKE BLACK ORAL TRADITIONS RATHER THAN TAKING THE CONSTITUTION A STUDENT COULD TAKE RACE GOVERNMENTS IN THE CONSTITUTION. WE'VE NOT REALLY ADDRESSED RACIALAND SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO HONOR THAT HISTORY OF ETHNIC STUDIES TO UNDER THE HISTORY OF THE COMMUNITY WORK THAT FOUNDED IT. TO UNDER THE HISTORY OF THE FACULTY AND STUDENTS WHO FOUGHT FOR IT AND FIFTY YEARS SINCE ITS INCEPTION I THINK THAT THIS BILL DOES A WONDERFUL JOB AND ADVANCING ETHNIC STUDIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY MY NAME IS ASIA CLOWNEY I AM A JUNIOR AT CALIFORNIA STATE. UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES DOUBLE MAJORING IN COMMUNICATION AND PAN AFRICAN STUDIES I'M ALSO A PRESIDENT OF THE BLACK SITTING UNION. I SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN SIXTY AND THE CREATION OF ETHNIC STUDIES -- ADD REQUIREMENT IN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM AS YOU MAY KNOW ETHNIC STUDIES WAS FOUGHT FOR AND WON BY STUDENTS FACULTY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS FIFTY YEARS AGO AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE LONGEST STUDENT LED STRIKE IN THE NATION. AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT ONE OF THE KEY DEMANDS WITH THE CREATION OF DISCIPLINES THAT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACK PEOPLE. CHECKING NEGLECT THE NEXT PEOPLE NOT NATIVE PEOPLE IN ASIAN FOLKS MY CAMPUS CAST THE DELAYED WITH THE SECOND UNIVERSITY IN THE COUNTRY SO WHEN A BLACK CITY'S DEPARTMENT. WHICH IS PAN AFRICAN STUDIES ON OUR CAMPUS AND THE FIRST HAVE TO KIND OF STUDIES. I'M HERE TO CONTINUE IN THAT TRADITION. AND I'M AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WHY ETHNIC STUDIES NEED TO BE A REQUIREMENT. ETHNIC STUDIES IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY BUT ESSENTIAL FOR A SOLID EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION AND THE WORLD WE LIVE IN IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE MAY BETTER COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER FROM DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. IT WAS WHEN I WROTE IT PAN AFRICAN STUDIES THAT I GAVE THE CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT MY BLACK HISTORY NOT THE HISTORY THAT HAS BEEN ALTERED TO SUPPORT THE MASTER NARRATIVE. BUT THE HISTORY THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM ME UNTIL I GOT TO COLLEGE. RECENTLY I WAS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PRESENT MY RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BLACK STUDIES CONFERENCE IN NEW ORLEANS. DURING SPRING BREAK I IN ABOUT FIFTEEN OTHER SCHOLARS PARTICIPATED IN A SERVICE LEARNING TRIP IN MONTGOMERY ALABAMA. BOTH EXPERIENCES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE HAD I NOT BEEN A PAN AFRICAN STATES COURSES. I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN COMING TO COLLEGE I WENT TO THREE DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS ONE OF WHICH WAS A MILITARY SCHOOL SCHOOL DID NOT INTEREST ME BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE MYSELF OR MY STORE IN THE THINGS WE WERE LEARNING. MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE I TOOK A CRITICAL RACE THEORY COURSE ANY CHANGE MY LIFE. I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY EXPERIENCE WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT WHAT THAT WAS HAD BY MANY BLACK WOMEN. I WAS ABLE TO ARTICULATE MYSELF USING SCHOLARLY VERBIAGE I LEARNED THAT AS A BLACK WOMAN MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT THAN A WHITE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE BECAUSE OF INTERSECTION KNOWLEDGE HE LEARNING THAT RACE IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT. RACISM AND THE FACT OF IT IS REAL HAS GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND MYSELF USING FACT AND LOGIC RATHER THAN SOLELY A MOTION. I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD CONTROVERSIAL CONVERSATIONS IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS BECAUSE THE CONFIDENCE I HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH THESE COURSES. THESE COURSES HAVE ALLOWED ME TO EXPAND MY KNOWLEDGE IT HAS OPENED MY EYES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE WAR THAT WE LIVE IN. TRUTHFULLY I WOULD LIKE FOR PROFESSORS TO BE REQUIRED TO TAKE A CLASS AND ETHNIC STUDIES SO THAT THEY MAY BE EDUCATED AS WELL ON THE STUDENTS THEY ARE TEACHING. STUDENTS NEED ETHNIC STUDIES JUST AS THEY CAN JUST AS THEY ME MAD ENGLISH AND SCIENCE ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT FROSTED IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MERRY MORE OIL WITH THE CSU AND WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON THIS WOULD LIKE TO THANK HER FOR IT FOR HER TIME. RESPECTFULLY WE DO NEED TO OPPOSE THE THE BILL AND I'D LIKE -- TO INTERVIEWS ALISON RAN FROM OUR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS DIVISION THANK YOU. PART OF THE C. ISSUES MISSION IS TO PREPARE OUR DIVERSE STUDENTS TO LIVE AND WORK IN A CULTURALLY DIVERSE SOCIETY AND WE TAKE THIS MISSION VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE THREE MAIN OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL WHICH I WILL TOUCH ON BRIEFLY AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. FIRST WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT IMPOSE CURRICULUM CURRICULAR DECISIONS OR THE ROLE OF THE FACULTY IN CONSULTATION WITH CAMPUS ADMINISTRATION. THE CSU FACULTY ARE HIRED FOR THE DISCIPLINARY EXPERTISE THEY SHOULD BE RELIED UPON TO PROPOSE AND DEVELOP CURRICULUM. THIS BILL UNDERMINES THE PROCESS OF SHARED GOVERNANCE IT RELIES ON CAMPUSES AND FACULTY TO DETERMINE COURSE CONTENT. DEGREE IN GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE SUCH AS THIS WILL SET THE DANGEROUS PRECEDENT OF ALLOWING GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE CURRICULA AND THIS DOESN'T FACT THREATEN THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM. OVER CAMPUSES. SECOND THE PROPOSED BILLS NOT NECESSARY WE ALREADY HAVE CULTURAL DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS ON ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. OUR CAMPUSES AND FACULTY SAW A NEED FOR CULTURAL STUDIES COURSES AND DEVELOP THESE REQUIREMENTS EITHER AS PART OF GENERAL EDUCATION OR AS A STANDALONE CAMPUS REQUIREMENT. MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE MET BY EXISTING COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES FOR COURSES IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS ANTHROPOLOGY HISTORY. GENDER WOMEN'S STUDIES AMONG MANY OTHERS. FINALLY SUCH A REQUIREMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFERS OR EDT PROGRAMS AND THE PROGRESS TOWARDS GI. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY TEASER DELICATE BALANCE OF SIXTY UNITS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN SIXTY UNITS IN THE CSU. THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE CSU IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DEVELOP THESE TRANSFER PATHWAYS. SINCE THEN OUR TWO SYSTEMS OF WORK FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP OVER A HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND DEGREE PATHWAYS TO IMPROVE OUR STUDENTS CHANCE OF GRADUATING IN A TIMELY MANNER. ANY CHANGE TO GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS IN THE CSU WOULD REQUIRE US TO REVIEW ALL OF OUR EIGHTY TEAS AS THERE ARE NO UNITS ON THE CSU SIDE OF MANY OF THESE DEGREES. THIS COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON TRANSFER. THE BILL COULD POTENTIALLY ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTS USE USE GRADUATION MISSION OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AN AMBITIOUS EFFORTS SUPPORTED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE ISSUES GRADUATION RATES ELIMINATE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. STUDENTS WOULD BE FORCED TO FIT IN A MORE SPECIFIC COURSE REQUIREMENTS. AND CAMPUSES WOULD BE FORCED TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL COURSES TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DATA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHERINE NELSON I'M CHAIR OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE CSU. WE ARE THE INSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED AND THROUGH THE HIGHER EDUCATION EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER RELATIONS ACT. THE LEGALLY RECOGNIZED VOICES CSU FACULTY IN MATTERS OF SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC POLICY INCLUDING THE CURRICULUM. AND THAT IN TURN INCLUDES GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. WE OPPOSE AB. FOURTEEN SIXTY YOU HAVE HEARD VERY POWERFUL TESTIMONY IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO ALSO CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FACULTY CONTROL OVER THE CURRICULUM. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATIVE MANDATE FOR THIS OR ANY OTHER GRADUATION REQUIREMENT IS AN APPROPRIATE MEANS FOR ACCOMPLISHING. THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE LEGISLATION. FACULTY CONTROL OVER THE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> CURRICULUM IS A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE IN A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. A PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT TO US AS THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS TO THE ACLU. AND A PRINCIPLE THAT IN THIS INSTANCE MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LEGISLATIVE INTRUSION INTO THE CURRICULUM. CLICK HERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRICULUM PRECISELY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE DISCIPLINARY AND CURRICULAR EXPERTISE. TO BEST JUDGE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS NEEDED IN UNIVERSITY DEGREE. LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN SETTING DEGREE REQUIREMENTS COULD ULTIMATELY MEAN THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S AGENDA. SUPERSEDES FACULTY EXPERTISE AS THE BASIS FOR CURRICULAR DECISIONS. YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE OPEN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS SO IMPORTANT TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF KNOWLEDGE. AND STUDENTS ACQUISITION OF CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE ARE COMMITTED TO ETHNIC STUDIES. BUT WE SIMPLY DO NOT THINK THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT MANDATED CURRICULUM SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THIS CASE. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANY TWEETERS. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] I RIGHT QUESTION. YEAH BACK TO WEBER. I KNOW YOU HI YOU ARE A FORM OF FACULTY MEMBER AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION -- I WAS ALSO. COMMITTED TO FACULTY AT THE SEVERAL HOURS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTES. INSTITUTIONS SO AND THEN ALSO SERVED AS OF FACULTY SENATE MEMBER -- HIGH -- ORDER HARDLY HOW DID THE AGREE HE DON'T NEED FOR ETHNIC STUDIES -- AS A MEMBER OF FIVE ETHNIC GROUP MYSELF I WOULD LIKE. TO SEE THAT THAT HAPPENS -- TO INCREASE THE SENSITIVITY AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDENTS -- ABOUT THE OUT DIFFERENT ETHNIC GROUPS SO AND THAT THEIR CULTURE AND HISTORY. AND HI THE HERE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF OF BLACK STUDIES SO -- ON CAMPUSES SO. I AGREE HE IT DOES SET IMPORTANT BUT IN PRINCIPLE. IF WE START. NO STATE. MANDATE SET CURRICULUM WHAT IS A REQUIRE THE FULL GRADUATION ETCETERA ETCETERA. AT THIS WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR. OF FOR QUESTIONING MANY DIFFERENT AREAS SO. VERY POSSIBLY -- AND IN ORDER SO -- INFRINGING UPON THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM. THAT THE ES SARAH I SEE. THE LIST OF OF COURSE IS SELL US OUT FOR MANDATED -- ON DIFFERENT NOT CSU CAMPUSES SO. MY HOPE TO SAIL ALMOST TO A TWENTY INDIA TWENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT CAMPUSES SAID THEY ARE CURRENTLY OLD OFFERING DIFFERENT KINDS HEALTH. NICK STUDIES SO -- AND AS YOU KNOW. THE TIME IS STILL QUITE LIMITED -- DURING FOR OUR OF FOUR YEAR OF CURRICULUM -- AND HOW WE GONNA DEFINE. ETHNIC STUDIES SO -- WOULD IT BE A CERTAIN. SELECT DID. ETHNIC STUDIES SAYS SUCH AS A BLACK STUDIES. LOVE TO INCLUDE THE YOU KNOW KOREAN ETHNIC STUDIES OF KOREAN AMERICANS. IN THE U. S. -- WHATEVER HISTORY THAT THE WE MAY HAVE LESS OF ISSUES. IN A HUGE ISSUE IS THE LACK OF IN ALL FOR OUR APRIL. YOU KNOW TWENTY NINE EVENT THAT THE ENTIRE A KOREAN BUSINESSES A PUT DOWN -- WAS IT UP -- ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO IN THE LA AREA AND THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE AND RAISING THE SENSITIVITY -- ABOUT THE KOREAN AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IT IS IMPORTANT -- WHEN WE'VE? DON'T TALK ABOUT IT THE IT IT MAY BE SOON FORGOTTEN SEOUL IS A SAY IMPORTANT -- TO END UP ANY OF THE AND NICK. YEAH POOP SO SUCH AS JAPANESE OR CHINESE. SO AND THE HISPANIC. ARABIC YOU CAN GO ON AND ON HOW. WE GONNA -- CUT OUT. THAT THE INTEREST GROUPS SO. AMANDA WHEN IT'S DIFFERENT CAMPUSES. I WONDER IF -- THERE'S A SOME COMPROMISE -- BECAUSE OVER THE IMPORTANT TOPIC AT THE SAME TIME -- TO HONOR THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND THE CONCERN SO AND THEN ALSO -- THE KINDS OF ETHNIC STUDIES -- BEING DEMANDED BY THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- SINCE I SEE THAT AS OF REQUIRING TERRACE THE SO TO PROVIDE A CAMPUS IN ETHNIC STUDIES. INSTEAD WERE REQUIRING. WHETHER WE CAN COME UP WITH THE SOME OF THE EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS ENCOURAGING -- VAN. I'M SURE THE CAMPUSES WILL TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND THE TRIED ACCOMMODATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. SO WE ARE SUGGESTING WE WE WE HAVE INTEREST IN THIS AREA. AND THE LIVING UP TO THEM. AND A WHAT KIND OF ALL ETHNIC STUDIES THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE. A DEPEND UPON REGION AREA -- WHEN LARA BOOK IN A BLACK INTEREST A BANDEAU BLACK STUDIES IF TO SELL A LOT OF ASIAN MAYBE ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES ITS BAREST INCLUSIVE REALLY MAYBE? SO -- THAT MIGHT BE -- SOMEONE AT THE ALTERNATIVE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CAN. MODIFY ON THIS -- YOU KNOW -- AT THIS PARTICULAR OUR BUT THAT DOES SO -- MY KIND OF SUGGESTION TO YOU THANK YOU. HE WOULD ANSWER THERE OKAY -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO'VE COME -- TO FROM C. ISSUES -- CAMPUS AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN. ETHICS REYES IS FIFTY YEARS OLD AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE OLDEST -- ETHNIC STUDIES OF CAMPUSES OF IN THE NATION BEGINNING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SO WE WILL BE FIFTY YEARS OLD THIS YEAR -- AND FOR FIFTY YEARS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SAME THING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ENCOURAGEMENT AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO I THINK AFTER FIFTY YEARS A HALF OF A CENTURY. OF WE SHOULD BE AT A DIFFERENT PLACE WHICH AS I CONSISTENTLY SAY TO THOSE ON THE FLOOR WE NEED TO BE A POINT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO STUDY. BLACK HISTORY MONTH LATINO HISTORY MONTH API MONTH WE SHOULD BE A POINT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT IS DIVERSE THAT IS IN NOT ONLY K. TWELVE BUT POST SECONDARY. IT WON'T HAPPEN IN K. TWELVE MILITIA APPLE SECOND HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY TEACH THE SUBJECT MATTER NOT SIMPLY PASS OUT FLIERS ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME THAT THERE IS STILL IS ACADEMIC FREEDOM OF THE FACT THAT THE FACULTY WILL CHOOSE THE CURRICULUM. IT WOULD CHOOSE WHAT TO BE WHAT IS TO BE TAUGHT THEY CHOOSE THE TEXTBOOK AND THEY'RE NOT RESTRICTED. IN THE FOCUS OF THE COURSE THAT'S WHAT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IS ALL ABOUT NOT NECESSARILY BEING ABLE DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU WANT TO DO IT -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE NOW YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS I SPENT FORTY YEARS IT'S AN EAGLE STATE UNIVERSITY? OF NOT ONLY THE FOUNDER OF THE VARIOUS ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT OF WOMEN'S STUDIES BUT I ALSO SERVED AS CHAIR OF A DEPARTMENT FOR CLOSE TO THIRTY YEARS. A CERTAIN EVERY MAJOR GRAFFITI THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAD WHAT WAS THE UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM -- WHETHER IT WAS SERVING AS SIX YEARS ON THE ACADEMIC SENATE. OF THERE'S NOT A COMMITTEE AT ANY UNIVERSITY THAT THAT I CAN THINK OF THAT I DID NOT SERVE ON AND FOR YEARS I SERVED ON THE CURRICULUM COMMITTEE AT THE UNIVERSITY. AND RETIRED AS A FULL PROFESSOR OF WITH EMERITUS STATUS SO I'VE DONE THE ACADEMIC I KNOW HOW THE UNIVERSITIES WORK I KNOW THAT THE IVORY TOWER SELDOM OPENS ITS DOOR UNLESS THE DOORS KICKED DOWN. AND THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE IVORY TOWER THE FACULTY THAT ARE AN ACADEMIC SENATE ARE BASICALLY THE FACULTY THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE INSTITUTIONS. AND SO THEREFORE THERE ALWAYS GOTTEN THAT DIDN'T NEVER GOING TO REALLY FULLY OPEN. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CURRICULAR OF CULTURAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY STEP TAKEN AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET YOUR DEGREE AT ANY UNIVERSITY AND NEVER TAKE AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE? YOU CAN TAKE A CULTURAL STORE COURSE OF SOUTHERN ITALY OR SUDDEN EUROPEAN AND THAT IS A CUT CULTURAL COURSE BUT IT STILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF THIS NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE. WHO ARE EITHER AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO API AND THE ISSUES OF RACE AND INTERSECTION BETWEEN RACE AND CULTURE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE HAD? AT THIS AT THIS TIME AT THIS YEAR AT THE END AND AT THE UNIVERSITIES SO WE START TALKING ABOUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM IT IS STILL THERE. WE DO IMPOSE A NUMBER OF THINGS ON A UNIVERSITY WE IMPOSE AT LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS WE IMPOSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE AMERICAN HISTORY INSTITUTION REQUIREMENTS WE GIVE THE UNIVERSE IS THE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE HOW IT IS TAUGHT. BUT WE BASICALLY REQUIRED THOSE ISSUES OUT OF THERE SO WHEN YOU BEGAN TO ACTS BUT ACADEMIC FREEDOM WE HAVE A BROAD BASE OF OF OF THINGS THAT WE JUDGE THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE PART OF IT. ETHNIC SO YOU SHOULD BE A PART OF IT IT CAN EASILY BE INCORPORATED IN THE CURRENT COURSES THAT ARE REQUIRED WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A A STRICTLY STANDALONE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENT. IF YOU TEACHING HISTORY COULD BE TEACHING AMERICAN HISTORY TO VARIOUS LANDS IS AND WE SEE THAT NOW MANY CAMPUSES WILL DO THAT SOMEONE NOT. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE IS A HODGE PODGE OF REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY A FOCUS AND A REQUIREMENT THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO TAKE LEAST THREE UNITS OF ETHNIC STUDIES. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT K. TWELVE AND WE PASS IN K. TWELVE ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE THE FACULTY TO TEACH IT SAN DIEGO STATE OF OF SENEGAL CITY OF CITY SCHOOLS HAS A HAS ETHNIC STUDIES ON ITS BOOK YOU CAN TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES. BUT THERE ARE VERY FEW FACULTY WHO COULD ACTUALLY TEACH IT AND I REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS OFFERED IT'S AN EAGLE STATE WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT AND WHEN I WAS A PROFESSOR THERE WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND HIRED SOMEONE FROM THE COMMUTER COLLEGE COME IN ONE DAY. A WEEK WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DO THE TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES A ONE OF A HIGH SCHOOL THAT REQUIRE THAT REQUESTED IT. MAINLY BECAUSE THERE THERE WERE NO FACULTY ALL THAT COULD ACTUALLY TEACH THE COURSE WITH THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY THAT IS REALLY CENTRAL. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES FOR EVER AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT AND IT WILL COULD WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING UP ARGUMENT OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THE QUESTION IS IS IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. IS A GOOD FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE CONFRONTED WITH AN EXTREMELY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION. WOULD BE GOOD FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOW INVOLVED IN THIS CHALLENGES WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF HEADS OF ETHNIC STUDIES CLASSES. AND SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIVERSITY OF INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING OF THEMSELVES IN THE BIASES THAT THEY BRING TO THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. YES OUR TIME TO UNIVERSITY IS IT'S IT'S TIME TO DEGREE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT WHAT I FOUND OVER THE YEARS AS THOSE STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES PARTICULARLY STUDENTS OF COLOR. ACTUALLY GET TIME TO DEGREE BUT A WHOLE LOT FASTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY SEE THEMSELVES IN THE CURRICULUM THEY BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO CHANGE THEIR HISTORY AS WELL AS A CHANGE THE COMMUNITIES THEY COME FROM. SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE TRIED YOU COULD SAY IS THERE A COMPROMISE IS A COMPROMISE THE COMPROMISE IS WE REQUIRE ETHNIC STUDIES BUT THE INSTITUTION STILL GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE HOW THAT IF. THAT IS GOING TO BE TAUGHT WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS GOING TO BE LIKE AND ACTUALLY HOW IT FITS INTO THE PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSITIES THAT THAT OF THE YEAR. WE HAVE THAT'S POINTED OUT EARLY WE HAVE THE MOST DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS IN THE WORLD RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND YET WE FAIL TO ADEQUATELY REQUIRE AND SUPPORT THE MANY THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT ARE CENTRAL AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR ETHNIC STUDENTS IT IS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN MY STUDENT POPULATION GROW FROM. A MAJORITY OF OF STUDENTS OF COLOR WHEN I WAS TEACHING UNIVERSITY OF WALKING AND IN IN. SEVENTY TWO OF THE MOST AFRICAN AMERICANS IN MY CLASS BY THE TIME I GOT READY TO RETIRE I CAN TELL WHO WAS IN MY CLASS WHEN I WALKED IN WHAT WAS MY CLASS OF THE CLASS NEXT DOOR. BECAUSE STUDENTS BEGAN TO TAKE ETHNIC STUDIES AND I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT MANY OF MY GRADUATES ARE VERY DIFFERENT GRADUATES WITH THE LAWYERS A DOT. BECAUSE THEY HAD A DIFFERENT LEVEL CURRICULUM WHEN THEY TOOK A MINOR OR JOINT MAJOR IN AFRICA IN ETHNIC STUDIES. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR CREDIT THEIR SUCCESS. TO HAVING TAKEN AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AT UNIVERSITY WHEN WE DID THE ETHNIC STUDY RESOLUTION THAT WAS HERE. THE REPORT THAT CAME BACK FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WITH ALL THE VARIOUS ONES WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR AN ETHNIC STUDIES REQUIREMENTS. OF WILL IT OPEN THE FLOODGATES FOR ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS I HAVE NO IDEA. I DON'T WE ARE HAVING BEEN AT THE MAYBE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THE UNIVERSITY SO LONG I DON'T REALIZE IS THAT I DON'T SEE IT AS A SACRED INSTITUTION. THEY CAN'T CHANGE I KNOW IT NOT ONLY CAN'T CHANGE BUT IT HAS TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS WHO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY. SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE. AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO BASICALLY PUT OUR THOUGHTS AND OUR HEART WHERE WE BELIEVE. AND BASICALLY BITE THE BULLET AND REQUIRE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES IS A REQUIREMENT FOR GRADUATION. MANY OF OUR CAMPUS WILL ONLY HAVE TO MAKE MODEST ADJUSTMENTS BECAUSE IT MANY OF THEM HAVE ETHNIC STUDIES DEPARTMENTS THEY COULD SIMPLY INCORPORATING THE G. REQUIREMENTS. THOSE WHO DON'T CAN FEET WILL FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN HIRE HISTORIANS OR LITERATURE FOLKS WHO COULD OFFER COURSES WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL DEPARTMENT. IN THOSE ETHNIC STUDIES AREA BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE MOVE -- IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE STUDENTS KICK DOWN DOORS SINCE AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE FIFTY EIGHT LONG YEARS AND IT'S ABOUT TIME AT THE AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIFTY YEARS. THAT WE BASICALLY INSTITUTE A REQUIREMENT THE UNIVERSITY FOR ETHNIC STUDIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE WHEN WE GET A CHANCE WE GET A QUORUM. DOCTOR WEBER I JUST WANNA TRY TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. I WE HAVE HERE A HAND OUT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR -- THE CSU AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT OFFERINGS. THAT THEY HAVE -- COURSES I I ASSUME THAT THEY ARE -- YOU WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THE CSU. TO TO DETERMINE HOW THEY WOULD -- HOW THEY WOULD -- OFFER THAT ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS EXACTLY WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER. A PARTICULAR COURSE WE WOULD LEAVE IT UP TO THEM TO DO THAT BUT IT SHOULD BE AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURTS IN OTHER WORDS YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSED. ON THE MAJOR ETHNIC STUDIES GROUPS AND THAT WE THAT WE KNOW OF IN TERMS OF LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN API. AND NATIVE AMERICAN INDIE OKAY THOSE OF THE GROUPS OF THAT ARE THAT ARE THERE AND IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING I HAVE TO SAY THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE FOUGHT SO MANY BATTLES. THE UNIVERSITY WHEN I WENT THERE IS A A NAIVE TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD AND AND AND AND EVERYONE KNEW WHAT THE WORD ETHNIC STUDIES MET. UNTIL WE START HAVING MONEY AN OPPORTUNITY THAT EVERYBODY GOT CONFUSED THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ETHNIC STUDIES WAS WILL MAYBE ASSISTANCE GOT A STUDY OF EUROPEAN SOUTHERN EUROPEANS ARE MADE WITH THIS GROUP WITH THAT GROUP. MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS IF I TELL YOU THAT ETHNIC STUDENTS ARE FAILING IN PUBLIC SCHOOL WHO WOULD YOU THINK THEY WERE. WE ALL HAVE CLEAR UNDERSTAND OF WHAT ETHNIC FOLKS ARE AT THAT POINT. IF I SAY TO YOU WE GOT SOME MONEY TO GIVE TO FOLKS WHO WANTED TO BE INVOLVED IN ETHNIC STUDIES ETHNIC ACTIVITIES NOBODY KNOWS WHO THE HECK I'M TALKING BACK AS EVERYBODY THAT MOMENT ONE OF THE ETHNIC. BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW RIGHT I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STUDENTS WHO CAME UP THE STUDENTS WHO SPOKE. AND I AM I I WOULD SAY AS A EDUCATOR. AS A LONG TIME TEACHER THAT THAT THE STUDENTS WHO CAME UP DEMONSTRATE. THE POWER OF ETHNIC STUDIES THE THE POWER THE CONFIDENCE THAT A CURRICULUM THAT REFLECTS ALL STUDENTS A GIVES -- STUDENTS AND I THINK THE STUDENTS WHO SPOKE TODAY REFLECT THAT -- OUT. I HAVE A QUESTIONS ALSO FOR C. ISSUE -- THIS WAS NOTSOMETHING THAT THAT HAPPENED -- THIS BILL DID NOT COME ABOUT -- IN A VACUUM. IT CAME ABOUT THROUGH DISCUSSION. WITH FACULTY -- ESPECIALLY -- I I I I KNOW I HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. OF FACULTY FROM CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE -- HAD MORE THAN ONCE A CONVERSATION WITH THE FACULTY AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE THE CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IS THE CAMPUS THE CSU CAMPUS WITH THE MOST OFFERINGS. IN ETHNIC STUDIES THE LARGEST A CHICANO STUDIES DEPARTMENT PROBABLY IN THE NATION -- HAS A CENTRAL AMERICAN -- LATINO STUDIES PROGRAM BUT THERE WERE CONCERNS WITH FACULTY AT CSU NORTHRIDGE ABOUT WATERING DOWN OF THEIR PROGRAM I THINK THERE WERE ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER -- OF STUDENTS DEMONSTRATING OF STUDENT OF STUDENTS -- YOU KNOW OF OF BEING ON CAMPUS OF CONVERSATIONS INCLUDING WITH THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CSU STUDENTS SO THIS BILL DIDN'T HAPPEN. IN A VACUUM THE RIVER FACULTY INVOLVED ESPECIALLY I KNOW FACULTY FROM NORTHRIDGE WHO'D BEEN. INVOLVED IN CONVERSATION. WITH THEIR CHANCELLOR AT CSU WITH THE PRESIDENT CSU. NORTHRIDGE AND ALSO WITH THE CHANCELLOR TIM WHITE -- AND THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN FACULTY OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND THE ACADEMIC SENATE I KNOW THAT THEIR THERE WAS A STUDY DONE AT AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE -- OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES AT AFTER THEIR CAMPUS AND WHAT I GOT FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FACULTY OF CSU NORTHRIDGE THAT I pTHAT IT WAS THEIR FEELING AND THE FEELING OF THIS OF AT LEAST SOME OF THE STUDENTS AT NORTHRIDGE THAT IT WAS AN ATTEMPT BY. CSU TO ACTUALLY WATERED DOWN -- THE ETHNIC STUDIES -- WATER DOWN. OP RANGE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT THAT WAS YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THOSE WERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CONVEYED TO ME -- THEIR FEAR. THAT AT NORTHRIDGE THE BIGGEST DEPARTMENT. OF ETHNIC STUDIES LATINO STUDIES -- THEY WERE GONNA LOSE. ACTUALLY LOSE SECTIONS. IN IN THEIR COURSE OFFERINGS. SO WHILE. WE SEE THE VALUE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE SEE THE VALUE WEALTH WE SEE THE STUDENTS LINED UP TO SAY HOW VALUABLE IT IS IN THEIR LIVES. AS WE HEARD TESTIMONY AT THE SAME TIME. AYE AYE AYE AYES SEE. THE OPPOSITE HAPPENING -- ON ON AT LEAST THAT ONE CAMPUS SO I'LL LET YOU RESPOND. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA. ON THE CAMPUS OF THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE REQUIREMENTS AND IN FACT -- SEE SUN CONTINUES TO HAVE ITS A REQUIREMENT IN SECTION F. -- AND I I CAN SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO WATER DOWN OFFERINGS AND REQUIREMENTS AND ETHNIC STUDIES. AT ANY TIME. IN THE CITY HAS YOU ARE AND I DON'T KNOW SAN FRANCISCO STATE MIGHT ARGUE THAT THEY HAVE MORE ETHNIC STUDIES IN THE COLLEGE ABOUT THE STUDIES I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. SEE SON AND MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE EXTREMELY DIVERSE -- WE KNOW ABOUT THESE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WE AGREE WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY IN ETHNIC STUDIES AND AGAIN -- ETHNIC STUDIES ARE OFFERED ON VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES BUT NOT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. I AND DIVERSITY IS REQUIREMENT ON ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE WERE -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT -- BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ETHNIC STUDIES. I I I WOULD I WOULD SAY -- WELL. I'M MAY LET DOCTOR WEBER CLOSE AND THEN I'LL. UNLESS MR LIVING CAROL ALSO FEATURES SOME REMARKS -- I'M A I'M A GRADUATEOF CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE THAT WAS A GREAT -- EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CALIFORNIA THAN WAS MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. GROWING UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND AND SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE I HAD AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE IN RELIGIOUS MY WHOLE MIND -- OPENING UP WITH MY EYES -- TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE PEOPLE THAT I MET THROUGH IT WE LIVE KIND OF IT A BIT AT AT A TRAGIC TIME AND A LACK OF EMPATHY. TOWARDS OTHERS. LIMITED BY THE LANDS BY WHICH WE SEE THE WORLD. AND I THINK THAT -- DOCTOR WEBER ELIMINATED SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES THAT -- EXPANDING. PEOPLE'S MINDS IN COLLEGE THE WHOLE POINT A COLLEGE -- COULD REALLY BENEFIT SOCIETY AND SO WHEN WE'RE GOING TO COLLEGE AND ARE HAVING PEOPLE COME INTO OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. WHEN -- WE'RE TRYING TO PREPARE PEOPLE. TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY. THAT THAT THEY HAVE TO SEE. TO A BROADER LANDS AND THIS BILL IS A GREAT STEP TOWARDS DOING THAT THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY THAT UP YOU KNOW. I AND I APPRECIATE THE ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE HERE AND THOSE WHO PROBABLY LISTING IN THEIR OFFICES THAT -- IT'S TIME. FIFTY YEARS IS A LONG TIME. AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION FOR THAT LONG AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND AS I SAID AS A SET LISTEN TODAY REMINDED ME OF THE FIFTY YEARS OF STRUGGLE. AT THE C. ISSUE. IN TERMS OF ETHNIC STUDIES AND AT EVERY TURN ETHNIC STUDIES HAS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVING. ITS RIGHT TO BE ON THE CAMPUS AS AN ACADEMIC UNITS. IT CAME ON THE CAMPUS IS NOT BECAUSE OF FACULTY WANTING ACADEMIC FREEDOM AND COMING TO A REALIZATION ETHNIC STUDIES WAS IMPORTANT IT DID NOT. HE CAME TO CAMPUS BECAUSE STUDENTS PROTESTED FOUGHT AND BURNED IT DOWN BERMAN CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO GET ETHNIC STUDIES ON THE CAMPUS IT WAS NOT AN ENTERPRISE. EMBRACED BY THE FACULTY -- AND IT WAS YEARS EVEN AFTER THAT OF STRUGGLING ON THE CAMPUSES TO EVER GET THE FACULTY ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE THE VALIDITY OF THE OF THE COURSE STUDY AND THE CURRICULUM AND ITS UNIQUENESS -- AND STILL CONTINUE SOMEWHAT TODAY IN TERMS OF FOLKS BATTLING IT -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT IS EVERY AT EVERY TURN DEMONSTRATED ITS STRENGTH. AND IS AT ITS ACADEMIC WORTH OF A LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THIS I I HOPE THAT WE FINALLY TAKE THE STEP TO BASICALLY. MAKE ETHNIC STUDIES A REQUIREMENT. AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE AFTER A NUMBER OF YEARS AS WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT IT ONCE WE RE EDUCATE ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND THOSE WILL BECOME THE PROFESSORS. THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE AN AMERICAN STUDIES COURSE THAT IS EVERYBODY. THAT WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE AT OF HISTORY AMERICAN HISTORY IN AN INSTITUTION BEING TAUGHT WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS ONLY BE IN A FOOTNOTE TO SLAVERY. BUT BASICALLY TOTALLY INCORPORATED IN THE CURRICULUM SO THAT TRULY REFLECTS CALIFORNIA AND THIS NATION THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT TAKING THE FIRST STEPS OF REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT'S OUR ULTIMATE GOAL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE I. BUT WE GET A QUORUM. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO CALL FOR A VOTE BUT BEFORE I BEFORE [inaudible] THIS -- GO ON TO OUR NEXT WHEN I COUPLE OF THINGS -- AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE RICE SERVED AT RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND UNDERSTAND. OF THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF THE ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY. AND AS SOMEONE WHO I BELIEVE IS VERY -- MUCH DEDICATED TO THE IDEA. WHETHER IT'S AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR CSU. OR THE UC. THAT IT SHOULD BE THE FACULTY THE DICTATES THE ACADEMIC EVERYTHING ACADEMIC [inaudible] BELIEVING THAT. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AMANDA ASKED THE AUTHOR TO BE CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. BECAUSE I AGREE THAT FIFTY YEARS. IS A LIFETIME TO HAVE WAITED. I ALSO HAD THE THE GOOD FORTUNE TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY AT A TIME WHEN THE UNIVERSITY WAS BEING QUESTION THE GROUP THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY WAS BEING QUESTION -- WHAT WAS TAUGHT BY -- THE ACADEMY WAS BEING QUESTIONED THE CANON -- THE HISTORY WAS BEING QUESTION AND I BENEFITTED I BENEFITTED FROM BEING A STUDENT. LIKE OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LEVINE SAID OF THE BROADER A BROADER CURRICULUM. AND AS WE TALK ABOUT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE I'M REMINDED OF DOCTOR RIDDLE FULL OF BUNYE WHOSE BOOK -- OCCUPIED AMERICA IS PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY USED -- CHICANO STUDIES BOOK. AND IS PROBABLY GONE TO I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENT EDITIONS THAT WAS THE BOOK THAT I HAD. AND I USED AND I REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF OF CHICANO HISTORY BY A RIVERA FROM SAN JOSE STATE. FELICIANO AND REPAIR. FROM SAN JOSE STATE AND THE IMPACT THAT HAD ON MY OWN LIFE LIKE I SEE THAT THE STUDENTS LINED UP HERE TODAY. AND I WOULD SAY. THAT IF WE DO NOT ACT I AGREE WITH. DOCTOR WEBER THAT IF WE DO NOT ACT WE WILL BE BACK HERE IN FIFTY YEARS SAYING THE SAME THING THAT WHEN WILL THE CURRICULUM CHANGE WHEN WILL -- WE HAVE TEACHERS AT UNDERSTAND ALL CULTURES AND HISTORIES -- BE PREPARED WHEN WILL THAT HAPPEN. SO I I AND SUPPORTING THE BILL AND ASK AGAIN -- DOCTOR WEBER TO PUT ME ON AS A CO AUTHOR AND WE WILL -- LEAVE IT OPEN TO THE VOTE ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WITH THAT ON A HAND THE GAVEL TO THE VICE CHAIR AND I AM GOING TO PRESENT MY BILL [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU ALL OKAY GOT IT YEAH. IN ORDER TO ADD A GOOD WAY IF YOU. I REMEMBER HIM YEAH SO HE HAS SOMEONE BILL. THIS IS. BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS ON CAMPUS. YEAH. YEAH YEAH YEAH. OKAY AUDIO AS IF IN A ACTS IT -- PLEASE DO SO QUIETLY YEAH SO WE NEED TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT B. L. UP IN ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB -- THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BY -- CHAIRPERSON MEDINA -- ASSEMBLYMAN A MEDINA YOU CAN GO AHEAD TO WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS OUTDATED AND OVERLY COMPLEX WITH TOO MANY BARRIERS TO ACCESS. STATE AID DOES NOT ADEQUATELY SERVE TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM IS NEEDED TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EQUITABLE ENSURE MORE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE DEGREE. AB THIRTEEN FOURTEEN ANSWERS THAT CALL BY EXPANDING THE EXISTING CAL GRANT SYSTEM TO HELP COVERED NON TUITION COSTS. FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. REMOVING BARRIERS TO ACCESS SUCH AS AGE RESTRICTIONS TIME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND DOCUMENTATION STATUS. CONSOLIDATING AND SIMPLIFYING THE PROGRAM INTO ONE AWARD AND ADDING COVERAGE FOR SUMMER SCHOOL CLASSES. THIS BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH FINANCIAL AID STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AS WE CONTINUE TO FLESH OUT THE DETAILS OF THIS CRITICAL. LEGISLATION. I AM JOINED BY CAROLINE SIEGEL SAYING PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION. SABRINA EDWARDS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT. DAVID O'BRIEN DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSIONS AND LUPITA AT THE LATTER CHIEF DEPUTY THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CHAIRED BY STERN MEMBERS -- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO BE THAT CORTES ALKALINE THE CHIEF DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB -- THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE BELIEVE THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS STATE FINANCIAL AID -- PROGRAMS IN THE NATION THAT IS LACKING IN A LIVING EXPENSES -- THE LIVING EXPENSES IS IS SEVERELY INSUFFICIENT -- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE REVIEW IS NECESSARY NEEDED. THE CURRENT CAL GRANT SYSTEM IS CONFUSING. IT'S CONFUSING TO APPLY FOR COMMUNITY FUSING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A ELIGIBLE -- YOU HAVE A CAL GRANT A. B. C. IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP -- WITH DIFFERENT GPAS WITH DIFFERENT INCOMES WITH HIM A TIME OUT OF SCHOOL AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS FOR A STUDENT REGARDLESS OF THE SYSTEM THEY ENTER INTO. OF THE THE THERE IS A HUGE INTRIGUE CREASING COLLEGE DEBT FOR THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. THERE'S A ALSO AN INCREASE IN FOOD AND HOUSING BECAUSE IT IN SECURITY AMONG ALL STUDENTS AT THE AT ALL TIME HIGH. THE NEED FOR REFORM IS NOW -- WE THE DEMOGRAPHIC OF THE STUDENT TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN TEN TO TWENTY YEARS AGO. STUDENTS NEED TO WORK IN MAY NEED TO NOT GO -- INTO COLLEGE RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL -- AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR THAT WE CAN'T BE OKAY WITH STUDENTS LIVING IN THEIR CARS -- THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CHANCE A REAL ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY. AND SO -- AB THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WOULD STREAMLINING CONSOLIDATE ALL OUR PROGRAMS IT WOULD BE EASIER TO ADMINISTER AN EASIER -- TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR IT WOULD ALSO -- SUPPLY THE SUMMER CAL GRANT SO IT'S A BETTER EASIER TIME -- FOR ON TIME OR ARE -- TIME TO GRIEVE WOULD BE REDUCED CURRENTLY IT'S AS LONG AS SIX TO EIGHT YEARS OR LONGER. PRIVATE NONPROFIT SCHOOLS WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED WITH A PREDICTABLE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT. IN CALIFORNIA WE VALUE CHOICE NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN A PARTICULAR INSTITUTION AND SO WE OFFER THAT CHOICE WHICH IS A GREAT ASSET TO CALIFORNIA AND FINALLY ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENT DREAMER STUDENTS. WOULD NOW BE ELIGIBLE LIKE ANY OTHER STUDENT FOR FINANCIAL AID IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE MAJOR CAL GRANT REFORM HAS OCCURRED. THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM SHOULD BE STUDENT CENTERED THAT MEANS THAT IT NEEDS TO REFLECT THE STUDENT NEEDS OF TODAY SO WE WERE WE STRONGLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE CONSUMED ABOUT THOUGH BUT TERROR USE AT THAT EIGHT MINUTES. OR SO. WHAT'S UP. FRIEDMAN. FOUR MINUTES FOUR MINUTES OF EACH OR ARE IS SUPPORT.

A KEY STEP TOWARD DESIGNING A FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE THAT TODAY'S STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD AN ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. AND RECTIFYING THE BUILT IN INEQUITIES OF THE CURRENT CAL GRANT SYSTEM SO -- WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL PROGRAM QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BUT I DO WANT TO RESERVE TIME FOR STUDENTS AS WELL THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY VALLEY KINCAID WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S FOCUS ON THE FINANCIAL AID REFORM IN THE STUDENTS TOTAL COST OF COLLEGE AND WE JUST HAVE A CONCERN AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME. ESPECIALLY WHEN SEE SACK HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSING THE NEED FOR MANY OF THESE CHANGES SINCE LAST FALL SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE. ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS CHRISTINA MERECE AGE I'M A USC COLLEGE STUDENT -- I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS THESE CONCEPTS IN ADDRESSING THE NEED -- ESPECIALLY FOR A SUMMER TUITION FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION FOSTER'S POPULATION IT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED THANK YOU. VIDEO BORN REPRESENTING AMERICAN CANYON PEDIATRICS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS AND I THINK WE HAD SOME ALREADY. SEE NO MORE TWEETERS ANYMORE TO ENTERS -- THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- DR. I WONDER IF -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY HAS HAD ANY CHANCE -- TO TO HAVE SOME ESTIMATE OF ACOSTA. INVOLVED GO WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION. YES I HAVE -- IT WON'T BE CHEAP AND ONE OF THE TWISTERS BEHIND IT SAID THEIR CONCERNS WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS FAST ENOUGH. AND WE'D LIKE TO IMPLEMENT THIS RIGHT AWAY. BUT CERTAINLY TO REVAMP OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. TO ADDRESS STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT FOR SOME ARBITRARY DEADLINE TO ADDRESS THE TRUE COST OF OF OF OF COLLEGE WITH THE NON TUITION COSTS. PROBABLY SOMEWHERE UPWARDS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- SO IT WON'T BE CHEAP. BUT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DIVERSE ONE OF THE ISSUES OF OUR GENERATION IS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND GETTING MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES IN THE PIPELINE TO FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. SO WE THINK THAT WE CAN DO THIS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WE'RE GOING TO TRY -- TO ADDRESS THIS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT -- BUT WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGE THAT WE NEED. TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS FAR AS THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. IS MEANT AS WE STATED EARLIER IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE WE CREATED THIS CAL GRANT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE THESE NEW -- CAL GRANT TWEAKS AND BASICALLY OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE ALWAYS EXCLUSIONS. THE IT DID THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY -- OFFSETS OF THIS BILL WHO DOESN'T GET IT WHAT WE SHOULD B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOCUSING ON YOU AT&lt;/c&gt;</u> THIS WHO DOES GET IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S WHAT THIS. IS ABOUT THE AND AND WORKING AND WORKING IN THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL AS THE BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. THANK YOU. MISTER MCCARTY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- I I THINK THAT. THAT THAT THAT HIT RIGHT THERE WITH THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN MANY MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT TWEAKING. AROUND THE EDGES OUR FINANCIAL AID AND CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND EXTENDING A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS AND FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW STUDENTS WHO ARE VETERAN AND STUDENTS WITH THE WHO ARE THE IMMIGRATION STATUS IS IN LIMBO. AND SO WE THIS IS A HOLISTIC VIEW OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS WHAT THE TOTAL THE NEEDS ARE FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND LET'S FACE IT. THE COST OF GOING TO COLLEGE ARE VERY DIFFERENT. THEN WHEN IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO YOU COULD GET. THE CAL GRANT -- NOW IT'S MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND HAVE A PART TIME JOB AND GRADUATE WITH ZERO STUDENT DEBT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD PAY YOUR TUITION. ON YOUR OWN THREE YOUR PART TIME JOB OR TO YOUR FAMILY CONTRIBUTION YOU COULD PAY FOR YOUR HOUSING YOUR TUITION YOUR BOOKS AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE REALITY ANYMORE. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES OF THIS BECAUSE THE AVERAGE STUDENT DEBT LOAD IS NORTH OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THAT LIMITS -- STUDENTS AVAILABILITY AT START THEIR CAREER START A FAMILY -- SAY FOR YOUR RETIREMENT THE BASICS AND IT'S IT'S HARD HURTING OUR OVERALL -- ECONOMY AND SO WE LOOKED VERY HARD ABOUT THIS AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK -- THIS INNATE COMMISSION FRANKLY THANK OUR OUR BUDGET STAFF A HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION. COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING ON THIS FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW THE COMING UP WE THINK IS A VERY. SMART ROBUST PACKAGE NOT JUST PIECEMEAL BUT LOOKING AS FAR AS WHAT DO WE NEED FOR FINANCIAL AID FOR TODAY. AND TEN TWENTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND WITH THIS IS THIS BILL AND WITH THAT ASK FOR THE I BOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- STILL NOT HAVING A QUORUM WE WILL. YEAH STILL NO QUORUM WILL WAIT TILL WE HAVE A QUORUM TO TAKE A VOTE BUT I THINK THE STUDENTS AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR PRESENTING. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE TO THE PIZZA FROM THE PUBLIC -- SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION THANK YOU FOR THE YOU OFFER. NEXT WE HAVE A YES ITEM. TWENTY FOUR A. B. SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE THE SMITH WELCOME THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] READY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M DOING MOMENT PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH TAKE PLACE ON HIGHER INSTITUTION CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT TOOLS FOR ENCOURAGING COLLEGE READINESS. TAKING COLLEGE COURSES WHILE IN HIGH SCHOOL KNOWN AS CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT OFFERS THREE KEY BENEFITS ONE REDUCTION OF TIME TO DEGREE COMPLETION. TO INCREASE IN COLLEGE ATTAINMENT AND THREE CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. PARTICIPATING STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMPLETE COLLEGE THAN THEIR NON PARTICIPATING PEERS AND CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT HAS PROVEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE FOR YOUNG MEN OF COLOR. LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS. STUDENTS NOT ONLY GAIN VALUABLE CAREER SKILLS OR GENERAL EDUCATION UNITS THAT CAN TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY BUT THEY ALSO LEARN THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. THIS GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE TO CONTINUE WITH COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL PUTS THEM ON A PATH TOWARD ACHIEVING THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS. SUMMER IS THE IDEAL TIME FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS AS STUDENTS ARE FREE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND WORKLOAD THAT COME WITH RIGHT THEIR REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC YEAR. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW LIMITS THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO CAN ENROLL IN SUMMER COURSES AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ONLY 5% OF STUDENTS PER GRADE LEVEL HER SCHOOL ARE PERMITTED TO ENROLL IN THESE PROGRAMS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE EXPAND COLLEGE ACCESS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DURING THE SUMMER BY REMOVING THE 5% LIMITATION FOR STUDENTS WHO ENROLL IN GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES THAT TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY OR CAREER EDUCATION COURSES. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY A WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ERIC HARNISCH VICE PRESIDENT PUBLIC INFORMATION ADVOCACY AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS FOR COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS THANK YOU. THE TERM MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE AS A MEMBER SAID THIS BILL REMOVES LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO CAN TAKE CLASSES AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. DURING THE SUMMER -- FOR US A CALL TO THE CANYONS. MORE THAN A THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GET A JUMP START ON COLLEGE EACH YEAR -- BY TAKING CLASSES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS MATH THROUGHOUT THE THE DIFFERENCE MASTERS. WE WE'RE WE WAIVE ENROLLMENT FEES FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO CLASSES ARE FREE FOR THEM. THEY NOT ONLY GAIN VALUABLE CAREER SKILLS WERE IN GENERAL EDUCATION UNITS THAT CAN TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. BUT THEY WERE IN THE THAT THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE -- ARE THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE IN ROLE SUCCEED ACADEMICALLY IN THEIR COLLEGE COURSES -- THEY REALLY OUTPERFORM -- THE NATIVE -- COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS THAT THEY'RE SITTING NEXT TO IN THEIR CLASSES. AS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO MEET THE AMBITIOUS VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS OF INCREASING DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES. TRANSFER MORE STUDENTS TO FOUR UNIVERSITIES AND HELPING MORE STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY MOVED FROM CLASSROOMS O CAREERS WE NEED TO CREATE MORE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS -- AB SEVENTY TWENTY I HAS SOME IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS FROM THE COLLEGE AND CAREER ACCESS PATHWAYS OTHER ALSO IN EXISTENCE. SEE CAP CLASSES AS THEY ARE KNOWN ARE GENERALLY HELD AT HIGH SCHOOL SITES DURING THE REGULAR SCHOOL DAY. AND AND AND THOSE CLASSES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT ESTABLISH A FORMAL PARTNERSHIP -- AS WELL COLLEGES -- MUST PAY FOR THE COST OF TEXTBOOKS IN ENROLLED IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE OFFERS MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR STUDENTS GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL IN ALMOST ANY COURSE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFERS DURING THE SUMMER. SOMERS THE IDEAL TIME FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO ENROLL THE FREE THE RESPONSIBILITIES A WORKLOAD -- THE COME IN THE REGULAR ACADEMIC YEAR -- MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY TAKE THE CLASSES AT THE COLLEGE CAMPUS GIVING THEM A CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE CAMPUS LIFE. MAKE USE OF SUPPORT RESOURCES LIKE FREE TUTORING. AND LEARN THAT THEY CAN INDEED BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE. FINALLY OUR LOCAL PARENTS TELL SAID THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT FOR STUDENTS -- WHEN WE SURVEYED THE PARENTS OF ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH GRADERS -- IN OUR DISTRICT. 88% EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THEIR STUDENTS TAKING CLASSES AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY NINE WOULD ALLOW MORE THAN TO DO JUST THAT AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY WINNERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM [inaudible] THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE MOTION. BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE A I DON'T THINK WE WE STILL HAVE A QUORUM -- SO. WILL HOLD OFF ON THE MOTION AYE AYE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR -- ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS -- THE COMMITTEE OF BRINGS UP TO TWO TWO CONCERNS ONE HAVING TO DO WITH -- THE SCENARIO WHERE THE THE STUDENT ADULT STUDENT POPULATION GOES UP -- AND THE IMPACT. THAT THE REMOVING THE 5% CAP ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ON THEM AND THE OTHER -- CONCERNED THAT THEY BRING UP IS -- PROTECTING -- MINERS ON ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO JUST -- HOPING THAT I GET COMMITMENT FROM FROM THE AUTHORS THAT CHILL WORK WITH THE STAFF ON ON THOSE TWO CONCERNS OF COURSE WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF ANALYSIS ON THIS AND AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT ONCE WE HAVE A CORE WILL TAKE A VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE A ITEM SEVEN A. B. NINE THIRTY MR GLORIA. WHO'S BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY. WELCOME MR GLORIA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. VERY GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. PRESENT AB NINE THIRTY TO PROMOTE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY WHILE PROHIBITING THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES FROM INCREASING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. IN YEARS WHEN SITUATION IS INCREASED THE BOARD TRUSTEES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHANGES TO THE SALARIES OF EXECUTIVES VOTED TO INCREASE TUITION BY 5%. IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY IN JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES VOTED TO INCREASE SALARIES A PRESENCE BY 3% DESPITE THE THEN GOVERNOR BROWN'S URGE TO REJECT THIS THESE AUGMENTATIONS. UNDER GOVERNOR NEWSOME -- PARTS PROPOSED BUDGET THE CSU RECEIVE ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION -- IN ONGOING FUNDS FOR STUDENT INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CONDITION THAT STUDENT TUITION NOT BE INCREASED AB NINE THIRTY WOULD MAKE SURE THE CSU LIVES UP TO THIS CONDITION BY REQUIRING THE FOLLOWING. FIRST THAT EXECUTIVE PAY CANNOT INCREASE IN YEARS WHEN THERE'S STUDENT TUITION INCREASE. IN SECOND ANY POLICIES OR PROCEDURES OR INCREASES TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION MUST BE PLACED ON THE BOARD TRUSTEES AGENDA FOR INITIAL PUBLIC HEARING WITH THE VOTE TO TAKE PLACE AT A SECOND CONSECUTIVE. HERE. FINALLY THE CSU CHANCELLOR MUST MANDATE ICHI CAMPUS TO PREPARE AND REPORT QUARTERLY COMPARISONS OF CAMPUS BUDGETS TO ITS ACTUAL SPENDING LEVELS. LAST YEAR WITH A HUGE WIN FOR STUDENT SUCCESS AND BY INCREASING STERN ACCESS AFFORDABILITY IN EQUITY WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM. THIS YEAR WE HAVE EVEN MORE OPTIMISTIC START -- TO THE BUDGET CYCLE AND WE MUST PUT STUDENTS FIRST EIGHTY NINE THIRTY DOES PRECISELY THAT WITH ME TO USE TESTIFIED SUPPORT IS JENNY IN FROM THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION PRESENT. AS WELL AS NEW I'M -- I'D MOPAR I KNOW WHY THAT WAS HARD FOR ME TO GET OUTSIDE OF A IT'S A AS I PRESIDENT AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY. GOOD AFTERNOONMISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS JENNY AGAIN I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND US YES YOU EAST BAY PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND ADMINISTRATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE THIRTY AND AT SPONSOR OF THE BILL -- I'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TODD GLORIA FOR ALL HIS WORK ON THIS BILL -- AND A. B. NINE THIRTY IS THAT STRAIGHT FORWARD GOOD GOVERNANCE BILL. AB NINE THIRTY WOULD SEEK TO PROHIBIT CSU TRUSTEES FROM APPROVING EXECUTIVE PAY INCREASES DURING YEARS CSU INCREASES. STUDENT TUITION. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT EXECUTIVE PAY INCREASES INCLUDING ANY POLICY OR PROCEDURE RELATING TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PAY INCREASES. MUST BE PLACED ON THE CSU TRUSTEES BOARD AGENDA AS AN INITIAL INFORMATION ITEM WITH THE SUBSEQUENT VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COM AT COMPENSATION TO TAKE PLACE AT A FOLLOWING CONSECUTIVE BOARD MEETING -- THIS IS TO ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL PUBLIC COMMENT BETWEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PAY INCREASES IN THE VOTE. AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED JUST THIS PAST JULY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES SWIFTLY APPROVED A 3%. ACROSS THE BOARD PAY INCREASE FOR EXECUTIVES. THIS ACTION ALONG WITH MANY OTHER PAST ACTIONS HAS DEMONSTRATED AN INSENSITIVITY TO THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND IT SHOWS THE CSU BOARD THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO BE OUT OF STEP WITH WHAT THE PUBLIC EXPECTS OF PUBLIC SERVICE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE GREATER PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SEE THAT THEY PRIORITIZE STUDENTS OVER EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. FINALLY THIS MEASURE REQUIRES EACH OF THE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY BUDGET COMPARISON REPORTS TO THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE A AB NINE THIRTY IS A BILL THAT WILL BRING GREATER FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE USUAL WAY OF THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THAT IS THE USUAL WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. THE LAW IS CLEAR THE CSU IS SUBJECT TO FULL LEGISLATIVE CONTROL UNDER STATUTE AND ALL OF CS USE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES ARE STATE EMPLOYEES. THE CSU IS NOT A PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITY THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE FREE MARKET. IT IS A PUBLIC ENTITY MAKE FUNDED THROUGH STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES -- THROUGH TUITION DOLLARS AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO THE GENERAL FUND AND IT IS OPERATED BY PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE TRUSTEES MEANING THAT THE TRUSTEES CAN DETERMINE EXECUTIVE PAY BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATUREHAS DELEGATED THAT AUTHORITY TO THEM. THE LEGISLATURE CAN AT ANY TIME MAKE CHANGES TO THAT AUTHORITY OR PUT CONDITIONS ON THAT AT THE READY. AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF AB NINE THIRTY TO SEE GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND HOW THEY OPERATE WHEN VOTING FOR EXECUTIVE. COMPENSATION INCREASES. I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE MIDI COMMITTEE THAT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE CSU IS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC EDUCATION TO OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR THE MORE THE QUARTERLY BUDGET REPORTING PIECE OF THE BILL IS NOT DUPLICATIVE. THE WAY IN WHICH IN WHICH THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES DISPERSES ITS ANNUAL GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION TO EACH CAMPUS. IS OPAQUE CERTAINLY TO THOSE OF US TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND HOW EACH CAMPUS MANAGES THAT UP BY LOCATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRACK TO ENSURE THAT BASIC STUDENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE REQUIRED. TO BE FUNDED THROUGH TUITION ACTUALLY ARE FUNDED IN WAYS THEY SHOULD BE. THIS AGAIN POINTS TO LACK OF AND AND TO LACK OF IN GREATER NEED FOR FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF THE CSU. WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE STAKE HOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND ON BEHALF OF CFA WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO CHAIR MEDINA. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA AND TO CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION AND IN BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- MY NAME IS NO WELL MORE -- AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT OF ASSOCIATED STUDENTS AT SACRAMENTO STATE AS WELL AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. AS YOU KNOW TUITION FOR THE CSU SYSTEM HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS. AND AT THE SAME TIME SO HAVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES. BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THAT THIS BILL ENCOURAGES FOR TRANSPARENCY IN OUR SYSTEM BY ACQUIRING THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO INCLUDE. THE PROPOSED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION INCREASES -- ON THEIR AGENDA AS INFORMATION ITEMS AND FOR PUBLIC HEARING PRIOR TO BEING CONSIDERED FOR A VOTE IN THE NEXT MEETING. AT THE SAME TIME THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER THAT WE VALUE OUR EXECUTIVES TREMENDOUSLY I NOT ONLY APPRECIATE MY CAMPUS PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK HIS ROLE OUR UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMATIVE AND INVALUABLE. THERE'S NO BIGGER DISILLUSIONMENT FOR STUDENTS HOWEVER. THEN TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATE TO OUR STATE LEGISLATURE AND TO OUR GOVERNOR -- FOR THE ADEQUATE FUNDS TO RESOURCE ARE EDUCATION'S ONLY TO HAVE THESE FUNDS -- USED FOR EXECUTIVE SALARY INCREASES RATHER THAN AGAIN SAID EGGS EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. IN FACT THIS YEAR THE CSSA BOARD APPROVED TO PRIOR RESOLUTIONS. TO ADDRESS THESE EXACT ISSUES. TO CLARIFY THIS IS NOT AN EITHER OR SITUATION IF CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SO DIRE THAT ARE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES NEEDS TO CONSIDER OR EVEN IMPLEMENT. A STUDENT TUITION INCREASE THANK CLEARLY THERE SHOULDN'T BE -- ANY MONEY AVAILABLE TO INCREASE THE SALARIES OF OUR ADMINISTRATORS. I REMEMBER VISITING THE CSU WEBSITE EARLIER THIS YEAR FOR SOMETHING -- AND I'VE BEEN READING A VERY POWERFUL MISSION STATEMENT THAT REALLY SPOKE TO ME. AND IT'S DEFINED STUDENT SUCCESS PARTIALLY AS MAKING COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS. I LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE COULD SEE CONTINUING RAISES TO SEE CSU STUDENT TUITION. AND HOW THIS DOES NOT DELIVER TO THE PROMISE NOR CORE PRINCIPLES -- WHEN WE DO THINGS LIKE THIS I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN INCREASING SALARIES WHICH DEVIATES EVEN FARTHER FROM OUR OVERALL PROGRESS? BUT IT'S REALLY AN ETHICAL APPEAL. WE JUST ASK THAT THERE BE AN ETHICAL CONSIDERATION AS TO THE OVERALL BUDGET PROCESS AND STUDENT RIGHTS. WE ASK FOR THESE REASONS TO FOR YOU TO SUPPORT AB. NINE THIRTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THEY COME UP TO THE MIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. OF THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS RENE BAYARDO SO YOU CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THEY COME UP TO THE TABLE GOOD AFTERNOON. ENTER MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY -- WE MUST RESPECTFULLY BE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE -- WE DON'T SEE A CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT. WHAT OUR STUDENTS TO FEED TUITION FEE INCREASE AND THESE ARE CONVERSATION? WHAT THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN THOSE TWO ENTITIES THEY'RE MADE IN SEPARATE? OUR PACKAGES AND FRANKLY IT REALIZE WHAT WE GET FROM THE STATE WE CONSIDER TUITION THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR US THIS YEAR. AND THERE WILL BE A TUITION FEE INCREASE THIS YEAR FOR STUDENTS -- FRANKLY TUITION AT THE CSU HAS BEEN REMAIN FLAT FOR THE LAST -- EIGHT SEVENTY YEARS BUT WE HAVE INCREASED TUITION A RELATIVELY MODESTLY Là LAST YEAR -- AND THAT WAS TO ADDRESS GRADUATION IS DEPOSED ALTER SUPPOSEDLY SPELL FOR GRADUATION INITIATIVE. WE HAVE INCREASED -- WE HAVE GIVEN COMPETITION POLLS TO OUR EMPLOYEES ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES -- CLICK A BARGAIN BOYS AND OUR EXECUTIVES. THE COMPETITION PROVIDED FOR EXECUTIVES. IS AT A AT A RATE LOWER ART AT THE SAME RATE AS WE GET INTO OUR PLACE OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. WE THINK WE'VE BEEN GOOD STEWARDS WITH THE STATE'S DOLLARS WE'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL PUNISHES THE SYSTEM FOR SOMETHING I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT WE'VE DONE WRONG. FOR THAT REASON WE MUST BE OPPOSE THE MEASURE AND THEN FRANKLY THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE COURT REPORTING WE WE DON'T HONESTLY KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED THE STATE. WE'RE COMES TRANSPARENCY WE ARE WORK WITH A LOOK THE PART OF FINANCE WE WERE THE BUDGET COMMITTEES. EVER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE PER WEEK HOW WE SPEND OUR TO OUR EXPENDITURES. SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS THE ADDITIONAL VALUE OF THE COURT REPORTING FOR THE CAMPUS IS TO ASSIST OFFICE TO THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVIDE TO YOU. AFTER THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED. ANY TWO WINNERS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- MISTER GLORY WOULD YOU LIKE TO TO CLOSE THE SHERMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPTION PRESENT THIS BILL IN FOR CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH MY OFFICE -- TO GET TO THE OF THE NINE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE TODAY AND OVER THERE WAS A STRONG CONCERNS I'M HOT FOR THE CHAIR BUT I THINK YOU KNOW MY COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING. BOTH YOUR CONCERNS THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS AS WELL AS THE CSU SYSTEM ABOUT ME THESE THINGS ARE CONNECTED -- TO SAY THE TUITION AND EXECUTIVE PAY ARE NOT CONNECTED -- I THINK IS IS IS. HARD TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION I MEAN HARD TO HARD TO MAKE THAT CONCLUSION OF A FOR ASKING STUDENTS TO PAY MORE -- WHAT SOME OF HIS HE RAISING EXECUTIVE SALARIES I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF US CAN GO HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS EXPLAIN -- I THINK WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WORK CERTAINLY ALLOWING THE CSU TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THIS YEAR THEY'RE NOT A FORECAST NAY TUITION INCREASE -- SO THEREFORE THEY CAN INCREASE EXECUTIVE SALARIES -- BUT I THINK THE ABILITY TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THOSE DECISIONS A TO PROVIDE JUST REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS HOLDING TRUE TO THAT NOTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TUITION INCREASE EXACTLY PAY INCREASE. I THINK THIS BILL IS HOPEFULLY SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT TODAY -- IT OF COURSE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK -- I KNOW THE CHAIRMAN HAS SOME CONCERNS WITH THE REPORTING WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK ON THAT MR CHAIRMAN -- IS POSING A CONCERNS NEVER THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. EVERY STEP ESCRIBIR THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD IT DOES HAVE A NINE RECOMMENDATION. I'D I'D DO WOULD SHARE THE THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE -- THE POTENTIAL FOR TAKING AWAY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TRUSTEES -- BUT BUT THE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VOTE AS THEY SEE FIT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL CALL FOR THE VOTE GOD WILLING THANK YOU SIR. SO WE WILL NOW GO TO ITEM NUMBER -- ONE A. B. FORTY EIGHT MISTER O'DONNELL [inaudible] NUMBER. ONE WELCOME MISTER O'DONNELL. MAYBE GET THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR THEIR GUIDANCE -- AND SUGGESTIVE LANGUAGE. AB FORTY EIGHT IS A VEHICLE FOR TO SCHOOL FACILITY BONDS ONE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ONE IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE STATE HAS BEEN A STRONG PARTNER TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION OF K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. STATE BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN MATCHED BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOCAL BONDS AND DEVELOPER FEES. THESE FUNDS ENSURE THAT OUR K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AREN'T SAFE. AND UPDATED FACILITIES. AND BENEFIT THE ECONOMY BY GENERATING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. THE LEGISLATURE PLACED AND VOTERS APPROVED. TO US STATE TO STATE FACILITIES BONDS ONE AND WELL ACTUALLY SEVERAL ONE AND THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR TWO THOUSAND SIX THE LAST BOND PROPOSITION FOR FIFTY ONE WAS PASSED TEN YEARS LATER. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WAS A LARGE GAP IN TIME. DO THE LANKY GAP FUNDS FROM THE PROPOSITION FUNNY FIFTY ONE ARE NEARLY DEPLETED. THE NEED IS GREAT AND I ALWAYS SAY SCHOOL FACILITIES SET THE TONE FOR THE SCHOOL DAY. AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FIVE YEAR CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN ESTIMATES A TEN YEAR NEED A FORTY TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. THIS BILL PLACES CATER FOR THE A. K. THROUGH FOURTEEN BOND ON THE MARCH THIRD TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY ELECTION BALLOT. AND ANOTHER ONE IN ON THE NOVEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT. THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS WILL BASED ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS. BASED ON A RECOMMENDATION BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OFFICE THIS BILL PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOND FUND SHOULD BE SPENT. BALANCING LIFE SAFETY PROJECTS WITH PROJECTS TO ADDRESS GROWTH AND OTHER NEEDS. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION FOR BOND EXPENDITURES. THIS BILL REPRESENTS THE STATE'S PARTNERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO OUR K. FOURTEEN STUDENTS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS REBEKAH CURLY WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION -- MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITY COALITION. AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS FOR OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL MENTIONED THE NEED IS GREAT. FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ALONE IT'S ACTUALLY THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN OF COURSE THAT GROWS. AS WE LOOK OUT FOR THREE YEARS FACILITIES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL COMPONENT OF PROVIDING A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY EDUCATION. AS WELL AS CAREER TRAINING AND THEIR CRITICAL TO ACHIEVING PRIORITIES SUCH AS STUDENT SUCCESS. AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD FIND AT THE EXISTING CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE IT WILL PROVIDE COLLEGES MORE CERTAINTY AS THEY PLAN THEIR PROJECTS AS WELL AS THEIR BOND PROGRAMS. BY ADDING DETAIL TO THE BOND LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WHICH PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE AND ULTIMATELY WHICH PROJECTS TO FUND. THIS PROGRAM ALWAYS PRIORITIZES HEALTH AND SAFETY PROJECTS FIRST AND AB FORTY EIGHT WOULD MAINTAIN NOT APPROACH BUT IT WOULD ALSO ENSURE PRIORITIZING PROJECS THAT WILL. ADD ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE THINK LABS CLASSROOMS OTHER FACILITIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO EDUCATING STUDENTS AND IT WILL ALSO HELP MODERNIZE RENOVATE AN UPGRADE OUR FACILITIES TO OUR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STANDARDS. THIS PROGRAM HAS SERVED COLLEGES WHILE AND IT PROVIDES ACCESS TO A HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE KERN FOOT HELD THE ENDS -- SAN FRANCISCO SAN BERNADINO PERALTA AND YUBA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ALL IN SUPPORT I THINK THE ANALYSIS LAYS OUT -- EXCELLENTLY THE NEED FOR THIS BILL THE AUTHOR DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB EXPLAINING THE STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST FEW BONDS -- AND THIS WOULD CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION. ADDITIONALLY AS MY COLLEAGUES STATED THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL RELATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD HELP SCHOOLS -- HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THEY NEED TO PRIORITIZE AS THEY APPLY FOR THESE BONDS -- TO THE STATE MOVING FORWARD SO WE WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE THANK YOU.

THROUGH FOURTEEN WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. LARA MATS WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. ERICA REMAIN ON BEHALF OF THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WINNERS [inaudible] SEEING NONE. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE SHOULD HAVE A FOUR THIRTY CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK -- SOME REMOTE TOWN ON THE FUNDING QUESTIONS SIDE. THE SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT I KNOW WHAT THE OUT AGING IN OKAY. TO TWELVE FOR BUT THE MOSTLY -- DEUCE. WE'RE TRYING TO MATT THE BY A OF LOCAL ENTITIES SO RAISING THERE. ARE NOT A LOCAL TAX. IN THAT THIS WILL A MAN -- READING GET ANALYSIS HERE WE ALREADY HAVE A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF OUTSTANDING BONDS. NUMBER OF BOND SAID THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY UP APPROVED HAVE NOT BEEN EVEN ISSUED THE THIS ARE NOT FULLY UTILIZED. AND ON TOP OF EXISTING. KNOWLEDGE THAT'S THAT THOUGH YOU ARE TRYING TO ADD THE AND NOT THE I MEAN THIS IS A GOOD CASA I KNOW THIS PART OF COMMITTEES ARE NOT THE BUDGET COMMITTEES OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE BUT THE HOWEVER WE WE HAVE -- TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF YOUR BILL WHEN IT PASSES. AND I HEAR THAT THE NORMAL PRICE TAG THAT HAS BEEN NOT CALCULATED FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS BE AND HOW MUCH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LATER BUT THAT THIS ANALYSS AS NOAH. UPON THE MOUNT THE HAS BEEN DISCLOSED. SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN -- WITH -- DISTORT THE GOOD IDEA. TO HAD A SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TOP ON NEW BOND. RATHER THAN NOT LEAVING ARE LOCALLY OF FOR EXAMPLE -- IT. HI IN THE AREA THAT I COME FROM MARCH IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TRY TO PASS A THE OWN POSITIVE TAX OF FOUR WEEKS AFTER MISS A MINUTE OF A PURPOSES SO. SO. I KNOW IT IS A STRUGGLE. BUT NOW WHEN WE TRY TO IMPLEMENT THIS OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS REGARDING THE LOCAL SITUATION. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS THE ANSWER. WELL I THINK THERE COUPLE QUESTIONS MAYBE A COUPLE STATEMENTS IN THEIR FIRST WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EXISTING BOND -- THAT BOND MONEY HAS BEEN CLAIMED IT HASN'T ALL BEEN DISTRIBUTED BECAUSE THE BONTA HAVING ALL BEEN FLOATED AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT AGAIN THAT MONEY WILL GO DOWN TO THE LOCALS ONCE. ONCE -- ONCE THOSE BONDS ARE SOLD WERE WAITING FOR THE GOVERNOR TO ALLOW MORE THOSE LAWS WE STILL GET THAT'S FROM THE LAST BONTA THAT MONEY HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY CLAIM. GOING FORWARD THIS IS A BOMB I DON'T EXPECT THIS BOND WILL BE ANYWHERE NEAR A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS -- AT BEST IT MAYBE TEN BILLION DOLLARS WE DON'T KNOW TODAY BUT WE I I IMAGINE ALL THE SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE SO WHERE YOU. YOU'RE GETTING THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FIGURE I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT THAT THAT ACTUALLY IS IS AN ACCURATE. NOW THE LOCALS MIGHT FLOAT THEIR OWN BOND. WHICH COULD MATCH THE STATE DOLLARS BUT AGAIN THAT WOULD EXCEED. THE STATE BOND DOLLAR THRESHOLD IF YOU. ABOUT THE HERE I I DO SEE I DO READ THAT THAT IF I MAY TAKE SOME TIME ME -- THEN WHAT THAT TOO MUCH TIME -- IT SAYS IN ADDITION THE STATE HAS A THIRTY THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF AUTHORIZED UP BUT THE ISSUE. YOUR DEATH. AND THE MORE SO -- USTED HIS -- A NIGHT IN THIS POINT I MAY I I THINK THAT SPEAKS -- TO THAT POTENTIALLY SPEAKS [inaudible] TO THE ENTIRE. THE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING BONDS THE STATE HAS CURRENTLY. AND IN A STATE THIS LARGE A STATE WITH AS MUCH REVENUE AS WE HAVE I WOULD MANAGE THAT I WOULD I WOULD IMAGINE THAT FIGURE IS PRETTY MANAGEABLE. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THE MINISTER. HAS CHUNK OF MONEY A LOT OF MONEY NO DOUBT BUT THERE ARE ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS. SIX POINT TWO MILLION SCHOOL CHILDREN SO IT'S A BIG OPERATION AND IT DOES TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- OKAY HAVE YOU -- CONTACTED -- A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WHETHER THEY COULD TAKE CARE OF ALL. ON THE ON DISTRICT -- I'M SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I MEAN -- ANY SCHOOL FACILITY -- UP FUNDS SO NECESSARY BY EACH IS A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICT I EAT US MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL UNION NOT LAW. COLLEGE DISTRICT. THEY MAY HAVE -- DIFFERENT SITUATIONS UP IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY NOT NEED TO SUCH A BOND. OKAY -- WHEN THEY NEED IT THAT THEY COULD -- FLOW THROUGH OWN BOND. AND DETERMINED UP IDA UP OF A BORDERS TAXPAYERS OF THAT DISTRICT THE RATHER THAN WE IMPOSE THEM. SO SO IN THIS CASE IF THEY IF THEY CHOSE TO FLOAT AROUND BOND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY COULD SEE EACH SEEK A MATCH FROM THE STATE. DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I MEAN IF THEY DON'T NEED THE MONEY THEY SHOULDN'T FOR THE BOND. BUT THIS IS THE ISSUE MAY WAIT ROB ON MAYBE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND. I'D LIKE TO ADD AS WELL THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IT'S THIRTY BILLION THAT GOES UP TO ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT IS YET ON ISSUED IN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY SOME. OF FUNDS MAYBE ON ISSUED YOU KNOW YOUR ASSESSED VALUATION GOES DOWN YOU CANNOT ACCESS WHAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY VOTERS GIVEN WHERE THE ECONOMY IS AND AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACCESS THIS FIRST CASH. WE LOOK AT ALL OF THAT NEED AND WE LOOK AT THIS A YOU KNOW A COUPLE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE STATE BOND IT STILL DOESN'T MEET THE ENTIRE GAP OF THE NEED TO THAT WE HAVE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACILITIES ALONE. BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND THEN YOU ADD FOR K. TWELVE THAT AMOUNT IS WELL OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND FOR RENOVATING MODERNIZING EXISTING FACILITIES SO WE HAVE THIS VERY BROAD DEEP NEED AND WE KNOW THAT THE LOCAL AND STATE. RESOURCES WILL NOT BRIDGE THAT GAP WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN -- BUT THE NEED FAR EXCEEDS THE RESOURCES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AVAILABLE. WAS THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE WOULD THIS BE ON OF COMPETITIVE -- APPLICATION BASED -- HE SAID THERE'S A THERE'S AN ESTABLISHED PROCESS FOR DISTRICTS TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDING [inaudible] THANK. WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE -- ITEM. TEN AB ELEVEN FIFTY THREE MISS WICKS [inaudible] SHE'S HERE. WELCOME IS WICKS. I THINK I HAVE TO WITH YOU RIGHT YOU DO YOU HAVE A AB. ELEVEN FIFTY THREE TWELVE TWENTY NINE WATCH WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO. ELEVEN FIFTY THREE ELEVEN FIFTY THREE WHERE MY AGAIN. 1-156- REELS PRESENTING. TO ITEM. TEN THE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THE CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT REPORTING ACT AS WE REFER TO REQUIRES THAT A MANDATED REPORTER. AT REQUIRES THAT A MAN THAT A MANDATED REPORTER REPORT WHENEVER HERE SHE IN HIS OR HER PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY OR WITHIN HIS OR HER SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT. HAS KNOWLEDGE OR IS OBSERVE A CHILD THAT HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE OR NEGLECT ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS. NOW AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE MORE MORE MINERS ON COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE ARE CREATING CHILD CARE CENTERS THERE WHICH IS A GREAT THING. WE ALSO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT ARE -- ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES I WAS ONE OF THOSE MYSELF -- BUT IT MEANS -- FOLKS UNDER EIGHTEEN ARE ON OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES MORE MORE -- SO WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT TRAINING TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND -- WHEN -- ABUSE OR NEGLECT IS HAPPENING ALTHOUGH SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SETTING HAVE BEEN GIVEN THIS TRAINING EMPLOYEES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED. MY BILL -- ELEVEN FIFTY THREE WILL SIMPLY EXTEND THE TRAINING AND REQUIRE CLASSIFIED STAFF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO UNDERGO THE TRAINING MODULE THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS SO IT'S ADDING. SOME MORE CURRICULUM ONTO A CURRENT EXISTING TRAINING PROGRAM. AND TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE'S COMMENTS -- WE PLAN TO CLARIFY AN OFFER GUIDANCE TO DISTRICTS ON OTHER TRAINING MODELS THAT THEY MAY OPT TO USE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND INTRODUCE OUR WITNESS CHRISTY BULMA. CAN I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE SORRY.

IT'S THE END OF FOSTER YOUTH STUDENT HUNGER. ACT A MAJORITY FOSTER USE -- INSPIRED HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER ONLY 324% OF FOSTER YOUTH EARNED A BACHELOR DEGREE. AND LESS THAN 1% WILL TEN A MASTER'S OR DOCTORATE DEGREE. ISSUES OF HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS ARE PREVALENT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND MANY STUDENTS STRUGGLE WITH THE RISING COST OF BASIC NEEDS AND LIVING. A SIGNIFICANT FACTORED LEADS TO LOWER HIGHER EDUCATION ATTAINMENT FOR FOSTER YOUTH. IS THE LACK OF FINANCIAL STABILITY AND OTHER SUPPORT FOR MORE THAT MORE TRADITIONAL STUDENTS RECEIVE. MANY FOSTER YOUTH DEPEND ON FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND OFFICIAL BENEFITS SUCH AS CALPERS WOULD PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH INTEREST AND BENEFITS THAT SUPPORT THEIR HEALTH WELL BEING. AND SCHOOL AND WORK READINESS FOR FOSTER YOU STUDENTS CAL FRESH ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR BASIC LIVING WHILE THEY WORK TOWARDS A DEGREE. A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NECESSARY FOR FOSTER YOUTH TO GET OUT OF THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. THEREFORE WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAL FRESH FOR FOSTER YOUTH. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES AND BE SUCCESSFUL STUDENTS. MY BILL WILL ENSURE THAT FOSTER YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE. A TO BE FOOD SECURITY PURSUE WORK OPPORTUNITIES AND HIGHER EDUCATIONS BY DOING THE FOLLOWING THINGS ONE PROVIDE PROGRAMS.

FOR FORMER FARSI YOU SUPPORTED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE CRUCIAL PURSUING THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER GOALS. IT IS THE ONLY SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN RELY ON SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF A FAMILY FOUNDATION.

FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE A BILL THAT GIVES COLLEGE ATHLETES EVEN MORE TOOLS. AND PROTECTION TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OR ABUSES THEY MAY FACE ON CAMPUS. WE CONSTANTLY SEE EXAMPLES OF COLLEGE STUDENTS AND ATHLETES DEALING WITH ABUSE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IN A NEW WAY BY EDUCATING AND EQUIPPING OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES TO BE EVEN BETTER ADVOCATES FOR THEMSELVES AND PROTECTING THEM. AS THEY DO IT. REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO INFORM STUDENTS OF THEIR RIGHTS WITH THE DOCUMENTATION AND PUBLIC SIGNAGE. IT ALSO PROTECTS STUDENTS BY PROHIBITING RETALIATION BY SCHOOLS OF A STUDENT REPORTS VIOLATIONS OF ABUSE OR VIOLATION OF RIGHT. IT ALSO ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO CREATE A DEGREE COMPLETION FUNDING WHICH IS A MECHANISM SCHOOLS CAN CHOOSE TO CREATE. AND SHOES HOW IT WILL BE USED. THESE COLLEGES THESE COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE PUTTING EVERYTHING ON THE LINE AND RISKING THEIR BODIES. AND FOR SOME ONE INJURY AWAY FROM LOSING EVERYTHING. OTHERS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING IT ALL BY SPEAKING OUT FOR THEIR TEAM OR ANY ABUSE THEY'RE EXPERIENCING AS COLLEGE COACHES HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP YOU ON OR OFF THE TEAM.

LOOKS LIKE YOU WOULD TESTIFY BUT OF GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF TODAY I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB. SEVEN OH THREE WHICH WOULD WAIVE TUITION AND CERTAIN FEES FOR ANY EXONERATE WHO ATTENDS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. OF CAL STATE UNIVERSITY OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO TEN YEARS AFTER RELEASE -- AND EXONERATED SOMEONE WHO HAS WHO WAS INCARCERATED THAT IS LATER FOUND BY A COURT ORDER IF THEY WILL BE THIS CHARGE FROM LIABILITY. IN CRIMINAL CASES -- CONTACTS THE TERM EXONERATE MEANS REFERS TO A STATE OF WHERE A PERSON CONVICTED OF A CRIME IS LATER FOUND TO BE INNOCENT. IT'S NOT A REASON MAY BE RELEASED BUT LEFT SCARRED FROM THE TREATMENT FROM THE MEMORIES OF TRAUMA FROM THEIR BEING IN PRISON FOR A CRIME. THEY DID NOT COMMIT THIS INCLUDES THE LOSS OF USE OF OUR DECADES OF THEIR LIFE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION JOB EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING. THE MAJORITY OF EXONERATES 57% DO NOT REACH THE INCOME LEVEL THAT THEY ARE IN BEFORE BEING A CAR SERRATED. THIS RESULTS IN OVER ONE THIRD OF EXONERATES BEING FINANCIALLY DEPENDENT ON OTHERS ACCORDING TO THE COLLEGE BOARD HIGHER EDUCATION CORRESPONDS TO LOWER LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT POVERTY AND INCARCERATION. THIS BILL WOULD TO WAIVE TUITION AND CERTAIN FEES THAT ARE REQUIRED AT ANY CAL STATE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY OR UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO TEN YEARS UPON RELEASE. OF THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE EXONERATED NATION IN CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND HAS NO OPPOSITION. A HERE TO SPEAK I'M NOT SURE IF IT MAKES YOU'LL STILL HEAR. PEOPLE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE ROOM YOU MAY NOT BE HERE WHO'S A WHO'S SUPPOSED TO SPEAK CONCERNING THIS BILL BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND THE OTHER WILL. THE ON TO THE JACKSON IS A STUDENT AT FRESNO STATE WHO WORKS WITH OUR OF FELONY POPULATION I SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEETERS. SEEING NONE WELL I THINK YOU'RE A WITNESS IN. SUPPORT IS HERE. OKAY BUT WE LOVE THE BILL ANYWAY I KNOW I KNOW. IT'S UP TO YOU KNOW LOOK. AT THE GYM AT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IGNITES YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF EXONERATED NATION CO SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE -- WHICH IS ORGANIZATION -- CREATED BY EXONERATES -- AND ALSO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHICH WAS ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THE THE MEASURE AT THE STATE WHAT SUBSTATION PREVENTS ATTORNEYS. THE ONLY THING I'LL MENTION IS THAT OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH EXONERATE SOME OF WHOM WERE TRYING TO BE HERE TODAY COULD MAKE IT. UP TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE -- WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED FROM FROM PRISON WHAT WE REALIZED A FEW YEARS AGO IS THAT IF SOMEBODY'S ON PAROLE THEY RECIEVE -- FULL SPECTRUM OF SERVICES. UNDER THE PAYROLL DEPARTMENT -- AND UNFORTUNATELY EXONERATES AT THAT TIME RECEIVED NONE OF THOSE SERVICES SO. I WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A OF A PROBLEM WITH THE LAW. IN SO OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL IMMEDIATE SERVICES. A TWO EXONERATES ON THIS PAST YEAR IT'S OUR NATION CONVENE. A MEETING OF EXONERATES FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES IN THE NEEDS. OF EXONERATES AND WHAT WE COULD DO IN CALIFORNIA. ON TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER STATES -- ONE OF WHICH WAS THE CHALLENGE OF FOR THOSE FOUR HANDFUL OF A GENEROUS TO DO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED -- IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE IN TEXAS HAS BEEN ADOPTED A COUPLE OF OTHER STATES -- TO PROVIDE SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL -- SERVICE THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY MEDIA UPON RELEASE BUT IT'S SOMETHING SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE. ON THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF EGGS HONOREES TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TAKE ADVANTAGE AND GET INTO HIGHER EDUCATION -- THE MAJORITY OF THESE HONOREES WE DEAL WITH ANYWHERE FROM NINE TO OVER TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON -- AND SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND BUT THEY'LL SO OFTEN TIMES THEY CATCH UP ON MY DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS HONORING LA. WHO WENT ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION AFTER ABOUT? AFTER ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OF BEING OUT -- WE JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ANOTHER ONE WHO'S IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE TODAY ON HAS A NEED BASED SCHOLARSHIP BUT HAS THE PROBLEM HE WAS ONE SIX WAS TESTIFIED THE PROBLEM THAT HE CANNOT WORK. IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THAT SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT HE HAS BUT HE HAS TO WORK. THE PACE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. THE END OF THE DAY. THESE EXONERATES HAVE. BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. HAVE ENDED UP IN PRISON FOR YEARS AT A TIME BECAUSE OF OUR SYSTEM SO THIS IS JUST A WAY TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM DOWN THE ROAD. FOR THOSE REASONS OUT FOR SUPPORT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I I WANT TO THANK MY EXPERT WITNESS FOR COMING AND OUT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE I THINK THAT THREE OF THREE HAVE WE HAVE THREE BILLS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF EXONERATES. AND THIS ONE IS A EQUALLY IMPORTANT THE OTHER ONE DEALS WITH HOUSING ONE DEALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH. AND THIS ONE DEALS WITH EDUCATION IT'S A TRAGIC IT'S A SMALL POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY BUT IT'S BUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE UNFAIRLY. FOR TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS WE'VE DISRUPTED THEIR LIVES OFTENTIMES THEIR FAMILIES HAVE GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE THE WIVES OF ESPOUSES HAVE DIVORCED THEM WHATEVER IT IS WAS SO THEY COME OUT WITH NOTHING. OFTENTIMES WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF FAMILIES AND WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN FIND FOLKS THEY ONCE WORKED FOR A WHATEVER. AND SO WE THEN IT NEED TO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T GO BACK IN THE THEY'LL GO BACK INTO PRISON A BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES -- AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THIS IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO I THINK TO SAY TO THEM THAT WE WE WERE WRONG BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP YOU REBUILD YOUR LIFE. AND GOING TO SCHOOL IS ONE OF THOSE AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT WOULD DEAL WITH AS WELL AS HOUSING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE I. BUT WE GET A QUORUM. THEY COULD BE USED TO EXONERATE. AT LEAST TO EXONERATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- AWHILE BACK ONE OF WHO IS I REMEMBER CORRECTLY EVEN RAN FOR THE ASSEMBLY. OF WHAT THE OTHER WAS -- AT LOYOLA MARYMOUNT DOING VERY WELL -- BUT SO I THINK THE AUTHOR -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD A IT'S IT'S I THINK NEEDED AND I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THANK YOU. NOW WE WILL GO TO ITEM EIGHT A. B.. NINE SIX THREE THERE'S BETWEEN NORSE. WELCOME. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE SIXTY THREE THE STUDENT CIVIC AND VOTER EMPOWERMENT ACT. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO DESIGNATE A CIVIC AND VOTER EMPOWERMENT COORDINATOR ON EACH CAMPUS. THE BE TASKED WITH DEVELOPING AN ACTION PLAN IN ORDER TO INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. AVAILABLE DATA SHOWS THAT WHEN COLLEGE CAMPUSES DEPORT DIVERT RESOURCES INTO ABOUT DEVELOPING AN ACTION PLAN. THE RESULT IN STRONG VOTER TURNOUT ONE EXAMPLE IS UCLA UCLA VOLUNTARILY TAKES PART IN THE ALL IN. CAMPUS DEMOCRACY CHALLENGE WHICH THIS BILL IS PARTLY MODELED ON AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM UCLA REPORTED A FIVE HUNDRED AND 37% INCREASE. IN IN PERSON STUDENT VOTER TURNOUT DURING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN MID TERM ELECTION WHEN COMPARED. TO TWENTY FOURTEEN THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THROUGHOUT OUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE INSTITUTIONS CAN AND REALLY SHOULD PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN ENCOURAGING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND INVOLVING YOUNG PEOPLE. IN OUR DEMOCRACY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS SAID THEY CAN VOTER EMPOWERMENT ACT AND I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE. COUPLE SUPPORTERS HERE TO TESTIFY. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US. MY NAME IS DOCTOR PATTY ROBINSON I'M FACULTY IRECTOR OF OUR CIVIC A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT UP PROGRAM AT COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS. I AM HERE TO SUPPORT. AB NINE SIX THREE I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING WE FACE A GROWING CHALLENGE IN THIS COUNTRY BY GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY ESPECIALLY VOTING. SOME SUGGEST THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING A CIVIC RECESSION. HIGHER EDUCATION MUST PLAY A ROLE IN CREATING CIVIC MINDED CAMPUS CULTURES THAT ORGANIZE FACILITATE AN IMPLEMENT CIVIC AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOT JUST BEFORE AN ELECTION. I REPRESENT THE VOICE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT ARE ALSO KNOWN AS DEMOCRACIES COLLEGES. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN CAMPUSES. WE SERVE TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE FIRST GENERATION AND ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. AS A RESULT MANY STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THE CIVIC OPPORTUNITY GAP THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE OR NAVIGATE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM AND ITS PROCESS SEES. THIS ONLY INTENSIFIES THEIR MARGINALIZATION AND KEEPS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR STUDENTS FROM FULLY UNDERSTANDING OR PARTICIPATING IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH MILLENNIALS AND CHEN Z. GOING TO WRECK COMPRISES THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC OR AT LEAST HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. UNFORTUNATELY MOST COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES TEND APPROACH CIVIC AND POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AS ONE AND DONE. CIVIC AND POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT IS TYPICALLY STRESS SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS BEFORE AN ELECTION. AND GREATER EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON VOTER REGISTRATION NOT VOTER EDUCATION A PARTICIPATION. OVERALL CAMPUS INVOLVEMENT IS INCONSISTENT AND IT DEPENDS ON WHO MOVES THE PROCESS FORWARD. ALTHOUGH A LARGE LARGER PERCENTAGE OF OUR STUDENTS ARE REGISTERING THEY ARE NOT VOTING. WHY THEY CAN'T CONNECT TO ISSUES ARE CANDIDATES THEY DON'T SEE THE RELEVANCY OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO VOTE? AB NINE SIX THREE WILL CREATE CAMPUS WILL CREATE A CAMPUS COMMITMENT TO POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AND INCREASE VOTER EDUCATION. LAST FALL THIS EXISTED ARE WE HAD A HAD AN EXIT -- X. EXCUSE ME HAD A DEDICATED EFFORT A COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS TO INCREASE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AMONG THE ENTIRE CAMPUS COMMUNITY. MUCH WAS A RICK MUCH CAME OUT OF THIS DEDICATED -- EFFORT ESPECIALLY GETTING INVOLVED WITH AND SOLVE IN LOOKING AT THE DATA OF OUR OWN VOTING STUDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE NUMBER FROM WHICH TO IMPROVE POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT. WE FOUND THAT IN THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ELECTION -- ONLY TWELVE POINT 6% OF OUR STUDENTS ACTUALLY VOTED. WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR A NIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OUR DATA. THIS YEAR WE CREATED A VOTER ACTION PLAN TO HELP GUIDE THE OVERSEAS RAPPER. YES OUR VOTER ACTION PLAN WE ALSO WORK WITH THE LA REGISTERS OFFICE TO HAVE A BOTH A BALLOT BOX PLACED ON OUR CAMPUS AND WE ALSO -- HAVE AND SOCIAL ACTION TEAM NOW WORKING -- TO GO TOWARDS THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION -- I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT IS VERY MUCH SUPPORTED BY THIS BILL AND I HOPE THAT -- YOU WILL ACTUALLY SUPPORT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT. HELLO MY NAME IS JOHN TO JACKSON AND I'M A THIRD YEAR AT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO -- MAJORING IN PSYCHOLOGY AND DOUBLE MINOR IN CRIMINOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE I'M ALSO THE SECRETARY MEMBERSHIP CHAIR FOR THE PRESIDENCY CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE ALSO KNOWN AS THE IN W.

STUDENTS PERCENT HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND OUR NATION ARE ACHING FOR GUIDANCE AND A MORE UNIFORM SYSTEM BUT ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. THE STATUS QUO FOR ACADEMIA HAS SHALL WE TAUGHT STUDENTS ABOUT HOW OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS BUT NOT ABOUT THE CIVIC WE ENGAGE VOTERS AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZERS WHO MAKE THE SYSTEMS WORK. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST STUDENT VOTER TURNOUT AS OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS WHICH IS UPSETTING AS MILLENNIALS ARE SET TO BECOME THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC. IN AMERICA MEANING THAT STUDENTS VOICE. IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS CAN TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS BILL MANDATES THAT THOSE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENSURE THAT THERE'S A DESIGNATED NONPARTISAN POSITION WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO PREPARE US FOR FURTHER -- REPAIRS FURTHER FOR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND VOTING BY EMPOWERING US TO EDUCATION AND RESOURCES THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO ACTIVELY BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. BY DESIGNATING FUNDS WERE PROGRAM THAT IS CATER TO FURTHER IN THE CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COUNTRY'S NEXT LEADERS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] JOINT. MEMBER PETRIE NORREYS SAW I UNDERSTAND -- I THINK TO YOUR IN INTENT OF THE PLO BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE. CONSIDER TO BE ALL ADULTS. AND IF FOR A CIVIC ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE DONE. IT. MAY BE BETTER -- DURING THE A HIGH SCHOOL. THE BECAUSE MOST COLLEGES TO WOULD HAVE -- LACK OF COLLEGE REPUBLICANS COLLEGE DEMOCRATS -- THERE ARE -- CLUB SAID THAT THE YOU CAN GET ENGAGED. AND THEN ALSO -- OTHER THAN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO MOST OF THE CSU UC SYSTEM SO -- ORDERED A TRAP THE STUDENTS -- OUT OF TOWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE MAY BE DIFFERENT THE DEPEND UPON -- THE CAMPUS -- THE RATIO OF PART OF TOWN STUDENTS. SOME MAY -- NEED. TO RE REGISTER ON THE CAMPUS OF FOR THEM. TO REALLY GET ENGAGED IN IN. EACH ELECTION -- SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT. IT IS TO EDUCATION IS GOOD THOUGH BUT TELLING Là DOLLARS SURVEY KNOWN THEY ARE OR IN IN. AT THAT AT LEAST IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND NOT TWENTY IS -- MANY OF THEM. AND GETTING INVOLVED IN IN THE ADULT EDUCATION AND CIVIC AND ENGAGEMENT. WHEN THE END OF THIS ORDER -- REQUIRE A CONDITION. OF OF TALENT GRANT PROGRAM. THAT'S THE END OF THE BURDEN YOU'RE GONNA. A POINT IN -- NINE DE ONE FACTOR MEMBER STAFF MEMBER. TO ADMINISTER OF HIS -- CIVIC IN VOTER IN PALM -- SO. EVEN THOUGH I DO SEE SOME BASIC. IT'S UP WITH I HAVE A MORE CONCERNS SO CAN YOU ADDRESS ON THAT CERTAINLY I'LL TRY TO TOUCH ON THAT THE POINTS YOU MENTIONED SO -- AS FAR AS KIND OF WHAT IS THE RIGHT STAGE TO GET TO AS YOUNG PEOPLE IN STUDENTS ENGAGE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. I THINK YOU'RE YOUR IDEAS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IS GREAT -- IN IF IF WE CAN START TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT BEING ACTIVE CITIZENS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A VOTER WHEN THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S TERRIFIC. I THINK I'M. MOST STUDENTS TURNING EITHER TURN EIGHTEEN RIGHT BEFORE THEY GO TO COLLEGE OR WHILE THEY'RE IN COLLEGE. SERVER FOR MOST STUDENTS THEY'RE IN COLLEGE THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT THEY VOTE. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS IN OUR DEMOCRACY IT AT THE COLLEGE AGE AND AND YOUNG ADULTS. IS THAT WE WE HAVE VERY LOW LEVELS AS VOTER PARTICIPATION VERY LOW LOW LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION IN OUR IN OUR CIVIC LIFE AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO THINK ABOUT EDUCATION NOT JUST AS SOMETHING THAT THAT ENDS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A CLASSROOM BUT EXPANDING BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES. AND INCLUDING YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A CITIZEN WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PART OF OF OUR DEMOCRACY I THINK THAT WILL ONLY MAKE. MAKE US STRONGER -- IS IN TERMS OF THAT CONCERN AROUND THE CAL GRANTS. I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. SO AT THERE WAS YES THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT TAKEN SO THAT THAT CONCERN HAS BEEN HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. SO. YOU MENTIONED THE AMENDMENT TAKEN SO I JUST WANT TO VERIFY THAT YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES WE ENGAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS YES THANK YOU AND AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS AND TAX AND FOR A FREE NOT.

THANK YOU AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL WILL BRING IT TO VOTE. SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA CALL FORWARD ITEM. THIRTEEN AB -- SEVEN MISS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURE EVERY STUDENT HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING FOR COLLEGE AND COST SHOULD NEVER BE THE FINAL DETERMINATION WHEN CHOOSING A COLLEGE TO ATTEND. THAT IS WHY I AM VERY EXCITED TO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN OH SEVEN THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY ACT THIS BILL WILL BRING STABILITY TO THE CAL GRANT AWARD BY IMPLEMENTING A NEW FUNDING FORMULA FOR WORDS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES. UNLIKE THE AWARDS FOR UC AND CSU THAT ARE ADJUSTED BASED ON CHANGES IN TUITION THE AWARD ALLOCATION FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES WAS SET TO A STATIC AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND UPON SUCCESS OF AB. THIRTEEN OH SEVEN CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES WILL INCREASE AND A JUST WITH FUTURE INCREASES THAT ALLOCATION. FOR THE CSU. CAL GRANT AWARDS PROVIDE CRITICAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS. AND OFTEN ARE AND CAN OFTEN BE THE FINAL DETERMINATION ON SCHOOL ACCESS. NOT ONLY DOES THE CAL GRANT PROVIDING AFFORDABLE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE IT SERVES A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF UNDERSERVED SERVE STUDENTS IN FACT 48% OF THE CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS ARE NOT THE EMAIL WHICH IS WHYTHE BILL IS A TWENTY NINETEEN LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY. AND AS WE ALL KNOW THE RECENT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS CANDLES HAVE BROUGHT ADDED SCRUTINY TO A LOT OF THESE UNIVERSITIES. THIS MAKES MY BILL THAT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT CAL GRANTS GO TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD COLLEGE. THESE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO LOST OUT ON ADMISSION SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE SCANDAL. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE INCREASE ACCESS TO COLLEGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO THAT STUDENTS FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN AFFORD COLLEGE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIME TO PRESENT WITH ME TODAY IS THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS TO TESTIFY AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JESSICA CAM I AM A RECENT GRADUATE FROM POINT LOMA NAZARENE UNIVERSITY.

LAST DECEMBER I GRADUATED FROM POINT LOMA NAZARENE UNIVERSITY WITH A DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK AND HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. TO CONTINUE TOWARDS MY MASTER'S DEGREE. THIS STRAIN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF NOT FOR THE BEAUTY FOR ASHES SCHOLARSHIP A SCHOLARSHIP FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS. FULL RIDE COMMITMENT FROM PLN YOU AND THE CAL GRANT. A MAJOR PART OF THE BEAUTY FOR ASHES SCHOLARSHIP PACKAGE AT PM P. ALLEN YOU IS THE CAL GRANT THIS STATE INVESTMENT IN A SURVIVOR OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IS MULTIPLIED BY THE UNIVERSITY'S COMMITMENT TO SEE SURVIVORS LIKE ME COMPLETE THEIR COLLEGE EDUCATION IT IS THE INTENT OF AB THIRTEEN OH SEVEN TO MAKE THE CAL GRANT AWARD FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE. NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES LIKE P. ALLEN YOU KNOW PREDICTABLE AND PERMANENT. THIS BILL DEMONSTRATES A COMMITMENT BY THE STATE TO ENSURE NOT ONLY STABILITY TO THE AWARD BUT EQUITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND THAT'S IN MY CASE SPECIFICALLY ENSURING SURVIVORS AND THE DIVERSE POPULATION THAT I AM REPRESENTING HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LIFT THEMSELVES OUT.

THANK YOU ALL I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU AND WITH THAT IF I COULD CALL FORWARD MR GABER ITEMS. FOR AB. SIX TWENTY FOUR WELCOME MISTER DAVID. PKO. MAYBE IT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT. AB SIXTY FOUR WHICH WILL REQUIRE SCHOOLS THAT CHOOSE TO ISSUE STUDENT ID CARDS TO INCLUDE ON THOSE CARS. PHONE NUMBERS FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINES. THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS ON SB NINE SEVEN TWO WHICH WILL SOON REQUIRE STUDENT ID CARDS IN CALIFORNIA. TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER FOR THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE FACING A CHALLENGING SITUATION INVOLVING. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL HEALTH ARE ABLE TO ACCESS TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT BE THAT MAY BE A CENTRAL TO THEIR PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WELL BEING. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A REAL AN URGENT NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. STATISTICS DEMONSTRATE THAT NEARLY ONE IN FOUR YOUNG WOMEN IN COLLEGE ARE VICTIMS OF RAPE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT NEARLY ONE THIRD OF COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS ARE GROWING IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE HIGHEST IN YOUNG PEOPLE AGES. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR IN SHORT IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES INCLUDING INFORMATION SUPPORT. COUNSELING AND TREATMENT REGARDING SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. AB SIX TWO FOUR WOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE INTERNET USAGE MAY BE MONITORED BY INTERVIEWS ARE. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LEE ENTRE CLARK HARVEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE. THANK YOU. I AM WE HONOR HER KARBI -- HAVE THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES WE REPRESENT TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE -- SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ALSO PROVIDE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND ONE OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES RECEIVE STATE FUNDING TO OPERATE THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE THAT IS NOW REQUIRED TO BE LISTED ON THE BACK OF STUDENT ID IS. BUT SUICIDE IS NOT THE ONLY CHALLENGE THAT CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE FACING AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL MENTIONED THE RATES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS STAGGERING. IN FACT TWO THIRDS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT 35% OF THEM ARE VICTIMS OF ASSAULT AND 90% OF STUDENTS WHO WERE ASSAULTED DO NOT REPORT IT. IN ADDITION RATES OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED ILLNESSES ARE HIGHEST AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AGES. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THE IMPACT OF A SALT CAN BE LONG LASTING AND CAN AFFECT THE STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY STUDENTS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES THAT CAN HELP THEM COPE WITH THESE ISSUES. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO PROVIDE STUDENTS TO GREATER -- ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT PROMOTE BETTER MENTAL HEALTH AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF AB SIX TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ONE REPRESENTS PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE. AS TOOLS. THE OTHER ONE WHERE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME TO THE TABLE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S RAYBURN AL AND I SERVE AS THE EDUCATION DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE WOULD DIMINISH THE EFFICACY OF THE ONLY NUMBER NOW QUIET AND STUDENT ID AND FATE. STERN IDENTIFICATION CARDS FROM GRADES SEVEN THROUGH COLLEGE. THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. SUICIDE AMONG OUR TEENS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS IS AN UNPARALLELED NATIONAL CRISIS SUICIDE RATES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE OF ALMOST DOUBLED IN SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. FOR THOSE BETWEEN THE AGES OF FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR ONE IN TEN COLLEGE STUDENTS SERIOUSLY CONSIDER ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. ONE IN TWELVE ACTUALLY HAVE MADE A SUICIDE PLAN. EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED. ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST WEAK AND VULNERABLE. REQUIRING ONLY THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE ON ID'S HELPS PREVENT IMMINENT DEATH AMONG OUR YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OF KILLING THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY THIS SINGLE NUMBER WAS REQUIRED BY LAW ON STUDENT ID'S WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND WITH UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AMONG OUR STATE'S PUBLIC AS WELL AS PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN COLLEGE COMMUNITIES. THIS NUMBER GIVE STUDENTS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE AND OTHER STUDENTS WHO KNOW CLASSMATES THAT MIGHT BE DOIG SO. A DEDICATED RESOURCE TO IMMEDIATELY ACCESS VITAL SUPPORTS NECESSARY TO CHERISH THEIR LIVES. WE SHOULD NOT DETRACT FROM THIS RESOURCE AS AB SIX TWO FOUR WOULD DO. BY ADDING UP TO FIVE MORE HOTLINES AND STILL THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED VERY WORTHY. BUT ALL CRITICAL IS HAS THE NUMBERS WILL NOT FIT ON STUDENT ID'S. UNLESS THERE ARE MADE SO SMALL THAT THEY BECOME USELESS. FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST YOU VOTE NO ON A. B.. SIX TWO FOUR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FILL BUSKER ME WILLIAM JOSEPH UNIVERSITY WE DID ORIGINALLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DID CONTAIN A PROVISION REGARDING -- OF REQUIREMENTS THAT STOOD NINETIES WHAT KERRY -- HOTLINE MESSAGES THAT WOULD DIRECTLY LINKED -- TO NOTIONS AND IDEAS THEIR UNIVERSITY AND ITS STUDENTS WOULD NOT SUPPORT WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE AUTHOR FOR OF A MANY THE BILL BECAUSE ACTUALLY REMOVED THE PROVISION THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STUDENT ID'S A CONTAINED A HOTLINE DIRECTLY. FOR SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOWEVER WHEN WE REVIEWED AGAIN THE HOT WINDS ARE LISTA FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALMOND AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITE IN PARTICULAR WE KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATELY AT THOSE SITES STILL CONTAIN. THE SAME KIND OF MESSAGES THAT BROUGHT TO THE TABLE IN OPPOSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST -- BUT THOSE ARE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL BE ADDRESS SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNTIL THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE DRESSED BUT WE DO SUPPORT THE IDEA. OF PROVIDING SOME KIND OF A DIRECT CONNECTION SO THAT STUDENTS CAN GET SUPPORTS OF ANY PARTICULAR FAIR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR SEXUAL ASSAULT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- GREG BERKELEY CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ANY TWEETERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR MR GABLE YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE THREE I YET INTERN FATALITY ANALYSIS. THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE -- WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU -- WITH THAT WE WILL -- GOING TO THE NEXT. ITEM AND WAIT FOR A QUORUM TO TAKE THE VOTE AND THE NEXT ITEM WILL BE. ITEM. SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN MISS PER WHEN AB [inaudible] FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX WELCOME MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. MEMBER -- I GREATLY APPRECIATE ALL THE INPUT FROM COMMITTEE STAFF WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS CALIFORNIA'S JUST ONE OF A HANDFUL OF STATES LACKING A DATA SYSTEM THAT SPANS ACROSS EDUCATIONAL SEGMENTS AND INTO THE WORKFORCE. OUR CURRENT DATA SYSTEMS EXISTENCE SILOS. DO NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER AND THAT MEANS POLICY MAKERS AND RESEARCHERS ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS OUTCOMES. US SUCH AS THIS -- AS SOON PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES SUCH AS WATER LONG TERM EFFECTS OF STATE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND SPENDING AN EARLY IN PRIMARY EDUCATION. HOW WELL ARE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT GRADUATES PREPARED TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE WHAT EQUITY GAP EXISTS WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL PIPELINE FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED SOCIAL ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS? AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX WOULD CREATE A TASK FORCE A COMPOSED OF CROSS CUTTING GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO STUDY THE CREATION OF A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM AND PRODUCE A PLAN THAT ADDRESSES. KEY ISSUES OF STRUCTURE GOVERNOR AND GOVERNANCE AND ACCESS. GOOD AFTERNOON SURE MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SERRA R. C. SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY IN ADVOCACY WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY -- A STATEWIDE POLICY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. DO YOU KNOW WE'RE CALIFORNIANS HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES APPLY TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE. DO WE KNOW IF STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERRED FROM COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO UC'S CS USE OUR OTHER FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS. WHAT ARE THE WORK FORCE OUTCOMES OF THOSE WHO DO NOT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL OR WHO GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL BUT DO NOT ATTEND COLLEGE? THE CAMPAIGN SUPPORTS A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX BECAUSE IT WOULD SET CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM. THAT WILL ENABLE THE STATE TO ANSWER THESE CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE OPPORTUNITIES ROAD BLOCKS AND OUTCOMES OF OUR STUDENTS. CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND THE REST OF THE NATION IN THIS REGARD WE KNOW THAT IN THE COMING YEARS THE STATE WILL NEED A GROWING SUPPLY OF EDUCATED WORKERS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF A DYNAMIC STATE ECONOMY. AND WE CANNOT MEET THAT WITHOUT ENSURING THE ACCESS AND SUCCESS OF STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER SILO TO HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WITH DATA THAT IS NOT LINKED TO OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS FROM WHERE OUR STUDENTS COME. NOR IS LINKED TO THE WORK FORCE WHERE STUDENTS WILL GO MEANS WE ARE UNABLE TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST -- OF TO TO CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS GROWING EQUITY GAPS IN EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS AND MEET FUTURE WORK FORCE DEMANDS REST ON ANSWERING THESE CRITICAL QUESTIONS. OTHERWISE THE STATE LACKS AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE ABOUT WHO THE SYSTEMS ARE SERVING WELL WHO IS BEING LEFT BEHIND WHEN THEY'RE BEING LEFT BEHIND AND WHY. AN INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEM FROM EARLY EDUCATION FOR TO WORK FORCE ALLOWS POLICYMAKERS TO ANSWER THESE CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND IN NAPLES THE DATE INFORMED DECISION MAKING THAT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING. GROWING EQUITY GAPS IN STUDENT SUCCESS IMPORTANTLY CAN BETTER A GUIDE POLICY SO LUCIEN'S AND INVESTMENTS AND HELP US ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THOSE EFFORTS -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] CHAIRMAN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BRENDAN TO IT ON BEHALF OF ADVICE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF AT IMPROVE SYSTEMS OF TRANSPARENCY SO WE CAN SEE IN IN P. TWENTY PROGRAMS -- WHAT WHERE THE SUCCESSES ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO REPLICATE AND THAT ALSO WE CAN POINT OUT MIL ELIMINATE THE? INEQUITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM SO WE APPRECIATE THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF ASSESSMENT DATA. ARE SO THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT THAT THAT'S MORE TRANSPARENT SO THANK YOU. CATHERINE NEVER GONE ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS SEE. NINE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES DOCTOR CHOI. MY CONCERN NOT WHEN THIS ONE IS SO WHEN YOU COLLECT -- KNOWN TO OUR TO A DINNER IS DATA -- OF EACH IS JUNE ON THE IS THERE ANY -- WAY YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONCE THAT THE DATA. IS COLLECTED THE US SO VAST AMOUNT OF LAW. A DATA ONE H. SHOULD -- THAT WELL THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS IS MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA WOULD BE PROPERLY -- PROTECTED AND AND YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT ENCRYPTION OR ANONYMIZING. DATA. SO -- WE HAD THERE'S ANOTHER BILL IN THE SENATE THAT'S WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TO AND AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNOR SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD ASSEMBLY VEHICLE AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST ISSUES IS. A DEFINING HOW -- TO PROTECT THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. SO WHO'S GONNA MANAGER OR OF THE STATE. OF WE HAVE NOTS WE WE GET OTHER SOME TALK ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNING BODY YOU KNOW BEEN IN THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS WHAT THE GOVERNING BODY WOULD BE BUT WE'VE LEFT -- THAT ISSUE OF YEAH I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THAT'S HERE THESE ARE ON CHARTER TERRITORIES FOR CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S WHY. I'M THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TASK FORCE AS THIS BILL DOES IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE SYSTEM RIGHT AND AND ONE OTHER CHARGES IS TO KIND OF COME BACK WITH. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON GOVERNANCE AND HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY OKAY FINALLY TO HAVE ANY -- THE BUDGET NECESSARY IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM. THIS IS THE AYE AYE IT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE IS -- MONEY I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH BUT THE WE'RE WE'RE REALLY TODAY JUST TALKING ABOUT THE THE POLICY OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE -- TO TRACK STUDENT UP PROGRESS LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE MANY STATES -- HAVE THIS IN PLACE ALREADY AT ALL AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT CALIFORNIA -- FOLLOW SUIT SO YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT OUR OUR GOOD PRACTICES SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE. THOSE BEEN A LOT OF THE LC FF IT IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE. BEEN -- THE THE THE MOORED. DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YOU WANT TO SEE HOW IS THAT MONEY BEING SPENT AND AND ARE YOU GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES AND THIS IS EXACTLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU COULD -- BE TRACKING RIGHT NOW IN SOME WAYS -- WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY -- TO TRACK THOSE THINGS ARE GONNA TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT THE CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IN A SITUATION WHAT KIND OF A DATA -- SPECIFIC INFORMATION WILL BE CRITICAL. FOR THIS SYSTEM TO BE DEVELOPED. HOW THAT'LL HELP? YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT OF HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN KINDERGARTEN AND GRADES IN KINDERGARTEN -- THE HOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE IN A CLASS YOU COULD BE. LOOKING AT OUT CUT HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE DROPPING OUT HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING FROM CERTAIN HIGH SCHOOL GOING DIRECTLY INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOW MANY ARE GOING ON CAREER PATHWAYS YOU KNOW STARTING EARLY ON IF YOU STARTED WITH THE CAREER PATHWAY LIKE OF THEIRS. HAPPENING A LOT OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW -- HOW MANY STUDENTS MAINTAIN THAT CAREER PATHWAY WHERE IS IT THAT YOU CAN BEST SPEND RESOURCES TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES? YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME SPECIALS. I'M SORRY YOU OUT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS DATE ARE. FROM MY KINDERGARTEN. THAT MEANT THREE ALL THE WAY MIGHT BEHAVE YES MY GREYS SO WHERE I LIVED OUT. AND THEN ALSO -- BECAUSE EACH SCHOOL STATISTICS. I THINK WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO TO DO IS MAKE SURE A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM WOULD INTER CONNECTED A SYSTEMS FROM. EARLY CHILDHOOD READ THROUGH K. THROUGH TWELVE THROUGH POST SECONDARY THROUGH THE WORK FORCE INDIVIDUAL. MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF A STUDENT'S TRAJECTORY THROUGH OUR EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND FOR TO WORK FOR SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOLD IT BE USED BY THE EMPLOYERS. BEFORE WHEN I HI YOU YOU -- WOODEN. ACCESS TO THAT DATA AND THEN ANALYZE SO HOW YOU GREW UP OF LOOKING OF OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT -- WITH YOUR TEACHER TALKED ABOUT YOU. I I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE USED BY EMPLOYERS THIS IS REALLY MORE ART. GET MAKING SURE THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS PERFORMING THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD BUT ALL OF THAT STILL HAS TO BE DEFINED THIS IS REALLY THE THE CONCEPT OF OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE. TO LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE CORRECT -- CORRECT POLICIES IN PLACE AND PUTTING BACK RESOURCES IN THE CORRECT PLACES ALL I DON'T KNOW YOU ARE SAYING MORE DATA SPEED UP BUT I'M VERY WE WE KNOW WHEN. FIRST ORDER. INFORMATION IS. IS OF BROUGHT TO LIFE IS ACCUMULATED AND OF HOW THAT ARE THE USED TO BUY HOME IN A AND THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE DEFINED STILL CERTAINLY WE ALL HAVE CONCERN ABOUT OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED AND AND AND THE THE WE JUST HAD THE PRIVACY INITIATIVE PASSED WHICH PUTS. A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THAT DATA WE NEED TO HAVE AN ENCRYPTED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT -- THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PROTECTED BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T USE DATA FOR GOOD THERE IS THERE IS. USING BIG DATA CAN HELP WITH RESEARCH IT CAN HELP -- CHANGE OUTCOME SO OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE WE HAVE THIS INFORMATION IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES THIS IS BEING ABLE TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND AND DETERMINE HOW OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS DOING AND WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE. THANK. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER. OF I JUST ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHENEVER YOU OF A QUORUM. RIGHT. COURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE AS WE WORK -- TO SOLVE THIS LONG STANDING ISSUE OF SILO DATA. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL. FOR A NEXT. ITEM. FIVE AB SIX NINETY SEVEN MR TING. WHAT THE FAQ MATURE THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ME? ON THIS LEGISLATION I KNOW THAT -- THIS LEGISLATION WAS. INTRODUCED TO LATER THAN MOST PIECE OF LEGISLATION SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US. THIS LEGISLATION WAS INTRODUCED TO VERY MUCH IN RESPONSE TO THE IGNITION SCANDAL THAT HAS REALLY ROCKED. THE COUNTRY AND FRANKLY ROCKED MANY OF THE ELITE INSTITUTIONS AROUND -- AROUND THE STATE AND ALSO AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE FAMILIES THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE SCANDAL WERE CALIFORNIANS. THE COMPANY THAT DID IT WAS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPANY -- THE UNIVERSES OF THE CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ALSO THE TOP RECIPIENT OF CAL GRANTS -- HAD THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE CHEAT THEIR WAY INTO THE SCHOOL -- SO WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS -- TAKE A STEP OF SEPARATE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE ORIGINAL BILL THAT WE PROPOSED AROUND. CAL GRANT SOME PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT AND COME UP WITH SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE -- TO ASK THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER AND AND TO PASS -- TO GIVE US A LITTLE MORE TIME TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON REFINING AND AMENDING THIS LEGISLATION -- WE AGAIN -- COMMIT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT WE WOULD NOT SET THE BILL IN APPROPRIATIONS WITHOUT WORKING THINGS OUT WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS. AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE AGREED TO AS OF RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE OBVIOUSLY WILL CONTINUE REFINE OUR ONE THAT WE WOULD. STRIKE THE CURRENT CONTENTS OF AB. SIX NINE SEVEN AND WE WOULD SPECIFIED WHEN WE WOULD STATE NOW THAT SPECIFIED THAT A QUALIFYING INSTITUTION FOR THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THAT GIVES PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT ADMISSION. TO APPLICANTS WITH THE RELATIONSHIP TO A DONOR OR ALUMNI AT THE INSTITUTIONS SHALL DISCLOSE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING. ONE IS THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO DID IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS WHO DID NOT MEET THE INSTITUTIONS EMISSIONS STANDARDS. REQUIRED OF ALL OTHER APPLICANTS BUT WERE OFFERED ADMISSIONS TO THE NUMBER OF THOSE IN. NUMBER ONE WHO ACCEPTED THE OFFER OF ADMISSION. AND THREE THE NUMBER OF THOSE IN TWO AND ROLLED AT THE INSTITUTION. SO AS WE ARE MERELY ASKING. FOR THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE TO BE ABLE TO TRACK. DATA -- ON ON THE INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BUT WHO ARE ADMISSION A MEETING -- APPLICANTS BASED ON A DONOR FOR ALUMNI PREFERENCE -- SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND THAT'D TAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS OR IN ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN [inaudible] OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON SORRY TESTING MIKE FROM. OKAY. ALEX GRAYS THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES -- WE HAD SUBMITTED -- A POSITION LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR CONCERNS WITH INDICATED THAT LETTER -- WAS THE TIE -- IN THE MANDATE TO PARTICIPATION FOR INSTITUTIONS IN THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE HAD. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO DO SELL -- AND I THINK AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND IN THE CONVERSATION I JUST HAD ABOUT -- CAN BE INTENT I THINK I DON'T KNOW. IN LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW FOR POSITION WILL CHANGE I THINK WE REMAIN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIDE OF THE CAL GRANT I THINK. YOU KNOW WE'VE INDICATED THAT WHERE -- WILLING TO EXPLORE -- POLICIES OR DISCLOSURE REPORTING WHAT HAVE YOU -- OUTSIDE OF THAT THAT CONTEXT OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS AS CAL GRANTS ARE FOR STUDENTS -- THAT AGAIN EYES WHEN REITERATE THAT WILL BE HAPPY TO TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST CONCERN REMAINS -- THE THE TIDE OF THE CAL GRANT -- IS YOU KNOW -- THREE QUARTERS OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- WE HAVE OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CAL GRANT STUDENTS OVER. FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND RECIPIENTS -- AND 47% OR CAL GRANT POPULATION IS LATINO AND 49% OF THE FIRST THEIR FAMILY TO ATTEND COLLEGE SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT. THAT -- THERE'S NO -- JEOPARDIZING OF THEIR ACCESS TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND I JUST WANNA SAY THAT OUR OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE COMMITTED TO EMISSIONS RECRUITING POLICIES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN THE COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND ETHICAL CONDUCT. AND IN THE WAKE OF THE SCANDAL WHICH I THINK WAS SHOCKING TO IN ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW. THEIR OWN INTERNAL POLICIES PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS. AND OUR INSTITUTIONS DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE ADMISSIONS POLICY OR APPLICANT POOL -- FOUR CRITERIA FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE -- WHAT WOULD BE REFERRED TO IN THIS INSTANCE IS A LEGACY IN THOSE WHOM? RELATED TO AN ALUMNI OR WHO MAY FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNIVERSITY -- OUR COLLEGES TO UTILIZE HOLISTIC ADMISSIONS REVIEW HICH IS A STRATEGY THAT ASSESSES THE APPLICANT UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OR QUALITIES BEYOND JUST MEASURES OF THEIR TEST SCORES ARE GPA. AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME BY. OUR ADMISSIONS STAFF IS ONE PART SCIENCE ONE PART ART BUT IT ALLOWS THEM TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT CAN BENEFIT STUDENTS IN EMISSIONS RUBIO -- INCLUDING YOU KNOW IF YOUR FIRST GENERATION OR A BETTER AND IF THE STUDENT HAS OVERCOME SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES TO GET TO COLLEGE WITH -- IS INDICATED IN THEIR PERSONAL STATEMENT OR IN LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION -- YOU KNOW THEY CAN ALSO -- LOOK AT THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW HERE'S YOUR GPA BUT WHAT. WHAT AMOUNT OF AYE A BEER AP OR IB COURSES ARE AVAILABLE AND DID YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THEM IF YOUR INSTITUTION DOESN'T OFFER MANY OF THEM IN ANY NUMBER OF THESE THINGS IN THE? IN THE ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND THAT ARE SET ON THE FRONT END FOR ALL APPLICANTS BE REVIEWED AGAINST -- ANY NUMBER THESE CAN BE -- MEASURED IN A WAY THAT A STUDENT COULD COULD RECEIVE A BENEFIT AND THEY'RE IN THEIR APPLICATION SO -- WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS -- BUT AGAIN OUR CONCERN FIRST AND FOREMOST REMAINS ABOUT THE TIED TO THE CAL GRANT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] ANY TWEENER. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] DOCTOR. SORRY I HAVE A TOO MANY QUESTIONS CHAIR -- NO SUCH THING IN MY OPINION. HERE ARE A SEE. YOUR BILL IS. NOT ONE OF THE SIX A MEASURE SO INTRODUCED IN THE WAKE OF THE THE RECENT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL. ARE HAVE YOU SEEN -- FIVE PHOTO APPEARANCE SO HOW WE CAN CONSOLIDATE THAT TOGETHER. DO WE HAVE TO DEAL EACH INDIVIDUAL OR ALL OF THIS IS SIX BEERS A SEPARATE. IT'S IT'S IT'S A GREAT -- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION DOCTOR CHOI -- MISTER LOWE MISS MCCARTY WHO'S COMING UP NEXT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PIECES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE DID DIFFERENT BILLS BECAUSE THEY ALL -- ARE DIFFERENT PIECES OF CODE SO AGAIN MY MIND WAS AMENDING TO SPECIFIC EDUCATION CODE AROUND CAL GRANTS -- WITHOUT GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL BUT WITH ALL THE OTHER BILLS ARE THEY ALL DO DIFFERENT THINGS SO THAT WAS THAT PARTICULAR REASON WHY OKAY. SO I CAN GIVE YOU A BETTER ANSWER FOR THAT. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] NO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SEARCH OF JUST ON THE IN IN RESPONSE TO THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES I I WOULD SAY -- THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE FOR HIM TO SAY THAT THERE'S NOT A SEPARATE ADMISSIONS PROCESS BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS OR THERE ISN'T -- IS VERY WELL DOCUMENTED THAT ALUMNI AND DONOR -- RELATIONSHIP CHILDREN WITH OUR STUDENTS WITH ALUMNI OR DONOR RELATIONSHIPS. GET AND AT A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE THAN CAL GRANT STUDENTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. THAT IS A FACT THAT'S AN UNDISPUTED FACT FRANKLY. AND SO -- IF IF THEY'RE ALL BEING EVALUATED UNDER THE SAME CRITERIA WHY DOES ONE GROUP OF STUDENTS -- SEEM TO GET IT AT A MUCH MUCH HIGHER RATE. THAN OTHERS -- AND AND FRANKLY WE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY PROBABLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC. DATA THIS IS ALL BASED ON ANECDOTAL INFORMATION IF YOU SCOUR THE INTERNET IT'S ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT PUBLISHED NOT DOCUMENTED. WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE ASKING FOR THE COMMITTEES ASSISTANCE. TO GET MORE INFORMATION IF IF THE FACTS ARE THAT EVERYONE'S GETTING INTO THE SAME RATE AND I THINK THAT'S THEN IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE WELL WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAYS. IF THEY ARE GETTING IN A DIFFERENT -- RATES THAT'S THE STRIKES ME AS TWO DIFFERENT DOORS TWO DIFFERENT PROCESSES I'M ALSO IN TERMS OF CAL GRANTS AYE AYE TO SHOW THE CONCERN I KNOW YOU HAVE A CONCERN AROUND THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE -- TO IN EXPLORING THE ISSUE WITH LEAD COUNSEL THAT WAS -- THEIR ADVICE ON THE DIRECTION TO GO IF THERE ARE OTHER DIRECTIONS WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO EXPLORE. OTHER. WAYS -- TO TO GET THIS INFORMATION SO WITH SO WE'RE VERY OPEN -- WHEN I WOULD ASK IS DURING THIS PERIOD IN THE NEXT -- FEW WEEKS TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY WORK WITH THE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND A PATH THAT'S A LITTLE MORE AMENABLE TO ALL OF US. BUT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY DO ASK FOR YOUR AYEVOTE FOR A. B. SIX NINE SEVEN SO WE CAN HAVE. FRANKLY A LITTLE MORE TIME WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS HAD BEEN READ AND HANDED OUT. I I WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR AND TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT THE AUTHOR WILL NOT HAVE THIS MEASURE HEARD IN APPROPRIATIONS AND TELL THE BILL IS IN PRINT. ABSOLUTELY AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHAT I STATED EARLY AND COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. AND WE WON'T HEAR IT WITHOUT. THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRS APPROVAL SIGNING OFF ON BOTH OF THOSE -- AND AND AND LET ME JUST FURTHER MAKE THE COMMENT THAT TODAY I I I STARTED THE DAY WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY -- THE PRESS CONFERENCE ON EXPANDING THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND WE HEARD HERE. AND COMMITTEE -- THERE'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS SINCE -- CAL GRANT PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPANDED -- I KNOW THIS BODY IS WORKING. DILIGENTLY TO EXPAND THE CAL GRANT WE ALSO HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE A BILL -- TO TO ESTABLISH THE FORMULA SO THAT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE TO KEEP COMING BACK. A YEAR AFTER YEAR -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE CADRE STAYS THE SAME FOR THE PRIVATES AS WELL -- I I THINK WE ALL VALUE THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE I THINK TWO OR THREE IN MY OWN DISTRICT -- THEY THEY ARE VALUABLE INSTITUTIONS INSTITUTIONS WERE OUR STUDENTS GAIN MUCH FROM ATTENDING. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OUR STUDENTS ARE CONTINUED TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THAT SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE CAL GRANT IS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE BOARD -- TO ALL STUDENTS WHETHER THEY ATTEND PUBLIC. AND PRIVATE. BUT THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH ME ON YOUR BILL. AB SO IN THE END THANK YOU AND AGAIN WE WOULD LOVE CAL GRANTS AND WE ACTUALLY LOVE ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THERE'S NO QUESTION IN THE STATE. AND I GUESS WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A CORE. BUT WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR. THANK YOU WITHOUT YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER MCCARTY. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO BILLS TO PRESENT. I DON'T FIFTEEN AN ITEM. TWENTY FIVE WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT FIRST. HOW ABOUT -- ACR -- SIXTY FOUR I DON'T. TWENTY FIVE IT WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE TOP SHEET ON MY PACKET AND START WITH ITEM TWENTY WRITER. YES SO I WOULD LIKE TO START BY. ADDRESSING OUR VICE CHAIR DR CHOI THAT THISIS. ONE OF THAT FIVE MEASURES AS FAR AS THIS PACKAGE THE SIXTH PIECE IS AN AUDIT. I REQUEST FOR AN AUDIT OF THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS OTHER FIVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. ONE IS THAT A TAX MEASURE SAYING THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO FRAUDULENTLY -- MADE CONTRIBUTIONS CAN'T USE THAT AS A TAX DEDUCTION SO IT'S IN THE REVAN TAX CODE -- ONE'S A REGULATION THE BEING P. THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS CODE AS FAR AS THE COLLEGE CONSULTANTS. THE OTHER THREE ARE HIGHER EDUCATION BILLS OF WHICH WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THREE RIGHT HERE SO THIS IS AN AC ARE RELATED. TO THE SAT ACT ISSUE OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS -- OPERATION VARSITY BLUES WE KNOW -- KIND OF ROCK THE THAT THE NATION AS FAR AS THE AUDACITY OF THE FRAUD AND UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC TRUST IN THE COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AND AND FURTHER PERPETUATED THE QUESTION AS FAR AS WHAT ABOUT THESE TROOPS. OPPORTUNITY GAPS IN COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY OF COURSE THERE WAS OUT RIGHT FRAUD WITH THIS SAT AND ACT EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS. PAYING OFF THE PROCTORS TO CHANGE THE ANSWERS -- HAVING DOCTORS -- FAKE -- DISABILITIES TO GET MORE TIME -- TO TO TAKE THE EXAM. OTHERS AN EXAMPLE IN BEFORE THIS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WERE IN NEW YORK A LONG ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL -- COHORT OF STUDENTS WERE CAUGHT IN A SCHEME WHERE THEY THAT PAID -- TEST TAKERS TO GO AND TAKE THESE -- PLACEMENT EXAMS AND SO. THIS IS AS OUT RIGHT -- FRAUD ILLEGAL ACTIONS BUT IT RAISES THE BIGGER QUESTION AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THIS SAT SAT EXAM YOU KNOW IS IT TIME TO TO RE EVALUATE IT -- THERE ARE A THOUSAND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS OUR NATION THAT HAVE NEXT THE SAT AND SAT. AND THEY ARE DOING WELL LOOK AT OTHER MEANS TO IDENTIFY THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE STUDENTS. AND SO WE'RE ASKING HERE IS IT A C. R. -- PROPOSAL TO ASK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU SYSTEM TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE USEFULNESS EFFECTIVENESS AND NEED FOR THE SAT AND ACT TO DETERMINE STUDENT MISSIONS. AND THAT THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE FOR BEFORE US TODAY. AND THAT WITH ME ARE TO STUDENTS ALEX LOPEZ A STUDENT UC BERKELEY AND NESTOR CARTOONISTS OKAY. AND NESTOR CARTON AS A STUDENT AT UCLA. HI GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SOMEONE NAME IS ALEX LOPEZ I'M FROM UC BERKELEY. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY AND THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH SAT AND SAT TESTING. AS A FORM OF EMISSIONS EVALUATION -- SO ACR SIXTY FOUR ADDRESSES THE EDUCATIONAL GAPS THAT ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS PARTICULARLY FOR UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF. AS A LOW INCOME FOR GENERATION LETTING A COLLEGE STUDENT GETTING INTO A PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY LIKE UC BERKELEY SEEMED UNREACHABLE. BECAUSE OF THE DISADVANTAGES PLACE BY EXAMS LIKE THE SAT AND ACT. I HAD TO APPLY MYSELF OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM TO FIND SUPPORT WITH TEST PREP BUT EVEN THEN I STRUGGLE TO REACH A COMPETITIVE TEST SCORE IN EITHER EXAM. MY HIGH SCHOOL ONLY OFFER TWO AP CLASSES AND MY JUNIOR YEAR ON TOP OF IT F. EXTRACURRICULAR PROGRAMS. AND A FULL DAY SCHOOL THEY SCHEDULE I ENCOURAGE MY PEERS TO SIGN UP WITH ME FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES. TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AS A LATINO LOW INCOME STUDENT FROM THE EAST BAY I HAVE TO SEARCH FOR COST FREE PROGRAMS TO DEMONSTRATE MY POTENTIAL APART FROM THE SAT OR ACT. FOR EXAMPLE I SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THREE SUMMERS IN STAFFORD THROUGH THIS MATCH LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND STEW PROGRAM. TO ENHANCE MY MATH SCIENCE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE SKILLS THAT MY PEERS BLACK TO BACK HOME IN MY HIGH SCHOOL. WITHOUT NONPROFIT PROGRAMS IN MY OWN URGENCY TO SEEK WAYS TO ENRICH MYSELF I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ATTEND UC BERKELEY SO I ASK YOU THAT YOU TAKE ACTION TO ASSURE THAT MORE MINORITY UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. ARE GRANTED AN EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY INTO COLLEGE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTHY. I LIKE TO THINK YOU OFFER HAVING HERE AND FOR PROVIDING ME WITH THE PLATFORM TO VOICE MY TESTIMONY. MY NAME IS MAY I'M GONNA. ADDRESS TO STOP BECAUSE WE WE FINALLY HAVE A QUORUM AND I WANT TO ESTABLISH A CORE. WE'LL COME RIGHT BACK TO YOU. WE'RE GONNA STATUS A QUORUM ALL RIGHT. MEDINA HERE CHOI [inaudible] QUIRK [inaudible] BLOOM. GABRIEL -- WHEN [inaudible] KILEY [inaudible] LEVINE [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER. MOVE THE BELL. WE HAVE A CORE. PLEASE CONTINUE. MY NAME IS NESTER KIND OF AN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AS A STUDENT WHO. HAS SURVIVED THE KEY TO TWELVE EDUCATION ACADEMIC PIPELINE I AM HERE TO STRONG SUPPORT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ROSE TO COMBAT FUTURE FRAUDULENT PRIMARIES. AND OR FRAUDULENT ENROLLMENTS PREVENTING THE CONTINUOUS OBSTRUCTION OF EDUCATION ABILITY AND OPPORTUNITY THAT IS EVIDENT THAT EXISTS TODAY FOR STUDENTS COMING FROM DIVERSE AND TO WEAR NON AFFLUENT BACKGROUNDS. MY EXPERIENCE NAVIGATING THE K. THROUGH TWELVE PIPELINE WAS ONE OF THE MOST STRENUOUS HURDLES THAT I HAD TO FACE. AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT IS A THOROUGHLY DIVIDED AWARE IN MANY CASES PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE UNDERFUNDED LACK OF RESOURCES. AND STUDENTS UNDERGO COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR SCHOOLS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE INDEX SCORES IT'S SOMETHING THAT AFFLUENT SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FURTHER I NAVIGATED THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THROUGH TOLL IN ROMAN COLLEGE CLASSES. ON TOP OF MY HIGH SCHOOL WORK QUARTERS. I WAS ALSO INVOLVED AND ANSWER THE TRAINING FOR THE LOS ANGELES MARATHON THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. AND ALSO IN AND ALSO ENTERED FOR THE GARMENT WORKER CENTER OF LOS ANGELES FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS ARE AT GREATER DISADVANTAGE WHEN APPLYING TO ELITE UNIVERSITIES. MANY COME FROM EDUCATION A HUMBLE BACKGROUNDS WERE HAVING ACCESS TO ONE ON ONE TUTORING IS NOT A POSSIBILITY AMONGST ALL FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS WHO ATTEND ELITE UNIVERSITIES MANY HAD TO BE VALEDICTORIANS. OR TOP UP OR TOP 10% OF THE GRADUATING CLASS YOU CAN BE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE THIS SHOWS HOW CLASSES AND ELITIST. THESE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS REALLY ARE WHEN ADMITTED WHEN ADMITTING STUDENTS AFFLUENT FAMILIES BRIBING THEIR WAY INTO THE LEAD UNIVERSITIES IS A FORM OF OPPRESSION AND ILLEGAL ACT THE FURTHER. NEGATIVELY EXPLOITS ALL STUDENT APPLICANTS TO THE SAID UNIVERSITIES AT A GLOBAL LEVEL INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE ME. WITH EVERY SENSE MENTIONED THIS IS WHY I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF A. B.. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEETERS. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] DOCTOR CHOI. I AM NUMB. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS -- BO OR IT IS IT IS A RESOLUTION THIS IS YOUR IS MEANT TO BE A RESOLUTION. YES IT IT'S A RESOLUTION. I SEE. IT'S A REQUEST FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU TO STUDY. THE USEFULNESS OF THE YEAH. I AM VERY FAMILIAR ARE -- ABOUT THIS CITY ACT. OF THESE SCORES. ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT PART OF EVALUATION OF MEETING OUR STUDENTS SO INTO COLLEGES SENIOR UNIVERSITY IS SO I'M ON MANY OR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND OR SOUL GPA ETCETERA ETCETERA. AND DID -- TWO ATOMIC MAJORS WHO WERE USED TO FOR A LONG TIME. AND THE TO MY OPINION THEY WORKED OUT VERY WELL. IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT. BUT THEY IF YOU. RECOMMEND THROUGH THE RESOLUTION. OUR TO PHASE OUT THE THIS -- IMPORTANT. A TO MAKE -- NAM MEASURING TOOLS. I WONDER THE FUTURE OF THE QUALITY. OUR IN THIS STATE WHERE IT'LL GO. AND THE MAYBE NEXT TIME. ARE YOU MAY QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF GPAS. AND THE WHAT BASIS HOW CAN WE USE. OUR TO SORT OUT THE ON ON UNFORTUNATELY. OUR GOD HAS GIVEN US SELL OR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ABILITY IN THE TALENTS -- AND THE BASED UPON A THROUGH COMPETITION OUT WE NURTURE BECAUSE SO WE CANNOT SEND EVERYBODY TO A HARVARD DOES DODD THE DIFFERENT NOT NAY US OF A SCHOOL OR SO AND THAT THEIR CHOICES -- AND THAT'S IT THIS HAVE BEEN NOT VERY IMPORTANT -- TOURIST. TO MAJEL THAT KIND OF LIABILITY SAID THAT COLIN SO. BUT THE NOW WITH THIS IS SO REVOLUTIONARY STEP. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IF NOT THE IS AS A TEA AND THEN A. C. T.. WHAT ARE THE MEASURES SO WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT IF YOU AT THE COLLEGE PRESIDENT THE HARVARD? IN A WAR YOU YOU. JUST SEE BERKELEY PRESTON HOW WOULD YOU ADMIT A STUDENTS BASED UPON WHAT. WELL THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND THOUSAND COLLEGES ARE ALREADY DOING THIS. AND WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND ALSO. A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY EVERY SAID TEXAS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT TEST SCORES -- NOT TO NOT TEST SCORES I'D GPA AND YOUR CLASS RANK BECAUSE THERE'S RESEARCH IS THOSE THAT YOUR SUCCESS AMONG YOUR PEERS. IS JUST THE EQUAL AS A PREDICTOR OF YEAR SUCCESS IN COLLEGE THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE AT SCORES ON THE SAT ACT BUT THE BIGGER QUESTION DOCTOR CHOI IS THAT. WE'RE ASKING THE UC AND CSU. TO STUDY THIS AND A POTENTIAL PHASE OUT THEY MAY COME BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE ARE FINE WITH THE S. A. T. WE'D LIKE TO KEEP IT AS FRANKLY WITH THE UC SYSTEM A BIG PART OF BY A PIE Y. WORKS FOR THEM IS JUST. THE THE THE THE RAW NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS YOU KNOW. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF APPLICATIONS IT IS EASY TO SORT THEM. BY -- BY TEST SCORE THROUGH THROUGH THE SAT SO AGAIN THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA -- AND THE CSU SYSTEM ARE GOING. TO STUDY THIS AND REPORT BACK TO US SO IT'S NOT A GUARANTEED THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF THIS AND WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE UTILIZED GOING FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND BUT THAT THIS IS SO. I I THINK FOR YOUR GENESIS OF THIS OUT RESOLUTION IS A YOU KNOW QUESTIONING THE VALIDITY OF NECESSITY AND THE A. C. T.. SO MUCH WE BEGIN THIS A QUESTIONING -- RANKING STUDENTS ACADEMIC ABILITIES SELF UP BASED UPON THIS KIND BUT TOURISTS ARE DONE WE CAN -- NEXT STEP WOULD BE WE CAN A QUESTION. ANY TYPE OF A QUESTION ARE. AT THE VERY IT AT ALL LEVELS OF A SCHOOL OR SO. EVEN TEACHER SHOULD NOT GIVE ANY TEST A HOW CAN YOU WRITE THOSE CHILDREN. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT THE RANKS -- GPAS CAN BE USED ABOUT THE LATER MORE LIBERAL SOUGHT CAN BE YOU DON'T WANT THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL HOW CAN YOU RANK ME AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT TALENTS AS SUCH AND SUCH A SO A I I THINK THIS IS SO CREATING. OUR SOMETHING ON NECESSARY -- IN A CAN WARM AND THEN IT MAY JEOPARDIZE. OUR FUTURE -- INTELLECTUAL ôNG. OF A WILL FIND SCORES SO THAT THE WE WE POST ABOUT THOSE THROUGH YOU SEE -- CAST A SYSTEM. I I WILL A JUST A PERHAPS A REPEAT. THAT THIS BILL I THINK IS ASKING FOR UC AND CSU TO DO A STUDY OF WE HAVE NOT. BUT THEY HAVE NOT DONE THE STUDY SO THERE. YOU KNOW THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT THEY FIND AND THE IN THIS STUDY IS TO BE DETERMINED. AND I THINK THAT IS THE THE INTENT OF THIS RESOLUTION -- THIS MCCARTY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH I I THINK THERE ARE THIS WHOLE COLLEGE SCANDAL RAISES A QUESTION NOT JUST PEOPLE -- ILLEGALLY MESSING AROUND THE SAT BUT PEOPLE WITH MEANS AND RESOURCES CAN. TAKE SAT PREP US ARE WITNESSES SAID AND IS THAT TRULY -- FOCUS ON YOU KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS OF A OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT AND INTEL. THERE ARE MANY POINTS OF RESEARCH THAT THAT POINT TO THE NEGATIVE THERE. AND SO THIS IS GOING ALLOW THAT ALLOW US TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT A THOUSAND SCHOOLS ARE DOING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND LOOK AT ALTERNATE MEANS TO EVALUATE STUDENTS OTHER THAN STANDARDIZED TESTS AND I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS ACR THANK YOU. IT ENJOYS -- A POSITIVE -- RECOMMENDATION -- I I BELIEVE THAT A U. S. C.. YOU SEE RATHER EXCUSE ME. UC -- HAS ALREADY BEEN ASKED FOR SUCH A STUDY -- SO THIS WILL BUILD ON THAT -- JUST WANT CLARIFICATION IS THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF DID RECOMMEND SOME SOME CHANGES FOR THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AND I THINK -- THOUGHT THOSE ARE -- SO THAT'S THE NEXT. ONE YEAH. FOR BOB YES OKAY AND AND WILL HELP YOU GET YEAR AND WILL TAKE BECAUSE IT COULD THREE SINGLE FOR YEAH [inaudible] SO ACTUALLY. MISS MCCARTY YEAH YES I I I FEEL TO ASK THE QUESTION DO YOU DO ACCEPT THE A MEMBER YES AGE FOUR YES THANK YOU. SO WE HAD A MOTION BY A DOCTOR QUIRK -- I NEED A SECOND. SECOND BY MISTER BLOW. A MATTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS BE ADOPTED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEDINA. MEDINA I CHOI. CHOI IN NO. QUIRK. QUIRK I BLOOM. BLOOM I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I WHEN -- WHEN I KILEY? KILEY NOT VOTING LEVINE LEVINE I LOW. LOW I PATTERSON SANTIAGO WEBER WEBER I'D. EIGHT ZERO THE BILL IS OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. NOW MOVING ON TO I DON'T. KNOW IF ANY ONE OF US SORRY ABOUT THAT. EIGHT ONE YEAH. ALL RIGHT ITEM FIFTEEN A. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU I GET THEIR WORK THE LAST BILL TODAY TO DO THE LAST THE LAST BILL OF THE YEAR. LAST OKAY THIS IS A THIS IS ALSO PART OF THAT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS REFORM PACKAGE. THIS RELATED TO THESE SPECIAL ADMITS THAT WE HEARD ABOUT THIS IS THE AUDACITY WORK AN INDIVIDUAL WAS. AWARDED TO ADMISSION INTO A UNIVERSITY FOR BEING A SPECIAL ATHLETE LET'S SAY TO THE WATER POLO TEAM. LATER TO FIND OUT THE PERSON DID EVEN PLAY WATER POLO AND MAY NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO SWIM. SO THIS WOULD ENSURE WHEN YOU HAVE THESE A SPECIAL ADMITS THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU SYSTEM THAT WE FRANKLY DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK. TO MAKE SURE THE INDIVIDUALS ARE CERTAINLY -- WORTHY OF SUCH SPECIAL -- EXCEPTIONS THAT WE WERE CERTAINLY SHOCKED TO SEE THAT TEN OF THE SEVENTEEN EXAMPLES IN THE US ATTORNEY'S ACTION WERE BASED IN CALIFORNIA -- TO AT OUR VERY OWN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY AND UCLA SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS. TO TO ENSURE THAT OUR CALLS ADMISSIONS PROCESS IS FAIR WE DON'T SQUEEZE OUT -- STUDENTS LIKE MIGHT WITNESS HERE -- MISTER ALEX LOOK THIS THANK YOU ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ALL RIGHT -- THE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS ALEX LOPEZ -- FROM UC BERKELEY -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AGAIN AND THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND HARD WORK IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OF INEQUALITY. WITHIN OUR SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION -- TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED EQUAL ACCESS TO COLLEGE. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE INTENDS TO PROTECT STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF FROM LOSING A SEAT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DUE TO FRAUDULENT ACTIONS TAKEN BY ADULTS WHO DISREGARDED THE EXHAUSTING PATH TO COLLEGETHAT MANY MINORITY STUDENTS LIKE I HAD TO TAKE. AS A LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT I WORKED EXTREMELY HARD TO GET TO SEE BERKELEY. AND IT'S UPSETTING TO KNOW THAT THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY WEALTH INEQUALITY. I SPENT ENDLESS HOURS STUDYING TO GAIN OF FOUR POINT FIVE GPA TO HIGH SCHOOL IN HIGH SCHOOL EXTRA HOURS AFTER SCHOOL PARTICIPATING IN YOUTH COMMUNITY PROGRAMS. THIS HARD WORK HAS BEEN DESPONDENT BY THESE CORRUPT OF ACTIONS. WELL SHOULD NOT BE THE SOLE DETERMINANT FOR SOMEONE'S ACCESS TO COLLEGE ESPECIALLY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF ALREADY HOLD A SMALLER PRESENCE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPORTED THAT 40% OF STUDENTS ENROLLED WERE LOW INCOME AND 25% WERE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GOING STUDENTS. I AM PART OF THE STATISTICS TODAY MY PEERS AND I WHO HAVE NOT HAD AN EASY PATH INTO THE UC SYSTEM SHOULD NOT HAVE OUR SEATS TAKEN AWAY BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS WHO PAY THEIR WAY INTO COLLEGE. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON ALL HARD WORKING STUDENTS WHO HAVE ABIDED BY A FAIR PROCESS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY DISGRACEFUL FOR ME AND OTHER STUDENTS AT THE UC WHO ARE UNDERPRIVILEGED STUDENTS OF COLOR. ASK THAT YOU TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT ALL HARD WORKING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND SECURE EQUAL ACCESS TO COLLEGE FOR ALL REGARDLESS OF INCOME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ANY WITH WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY TWEENER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. VERY BRIEFLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SOMEONE MEMBER CARD A NO YOU'VE TAKEN THE LEAD ON RESPONDING TO THE INITIAL SCANDAL -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BUT EMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO STUDENT ATHLETES THAT IT INCLUDES OTHERS INCLUDING FOLKS WHO HAVE MAYBE BEEN. FOSTER STUDENTS CHRONICALLY HOMELESS EXTREMELY DISADVANTAGED HAVE COUNTED IN IN THE ARTS -- AND OTHER THINGS AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROCEEDING THOUGHTFULLY HERE SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD JUST REQUEST THAT YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. FOLKS AT UC AND CSU TO TALK TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THIS SO THAT WE'RE GETTING AT THE HEART OF WHAT YOU. WANT TO DO WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN'T -- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA LET FOLKS SLIP THROUGH SHOULD BE AT ADMITTED BUT ALSO THAT WE'RE NOT PUTTING -- UNDUE PRESSURE ON THE UNIVERSITY AND AND MAYBE EXCLUDING SOME FOLKS THAT WE REALLY WOULD WANT TO BE PART OF OF OUR SKIN BODY. YES THANK IS BRIEFLY RESPOND TO THE CHAIR I I MET RECENTLY WITH THE CHANCELLOR CRISTINA YOUR ALMA MATER UC BERKELEY. GO BEARS. AND AND THEN SHE TALKED ABOUT THE PROCESS OF THEIR OUTLINING THERE AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK ABOUT INCLUDING THAT IN THE ENTIRE -- UC AND CSU SYSTEM IN THE BILL AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST ATHLETES THE COULD BE -- MUSICIANS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THIS WOULDN'T PROHIBIT THESE ADMITS THAT COLUMN -- ADMISSIONS BY EXCEPTION BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE FRANKLY DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION IS ACCURATE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE A COACH OR AN INDIVIDUAL. VOUCHING FOR THESE STUDENTS AND AS WE HEARD THEY WERE PAID OFF ON THE SIDE SO THIS JUST BRINGS MORE A CHECKS AND BALANCES TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE. GIVING SOMEBODY A SEAT WHO DESERVES IT AND NOT SQUEEZING OUT A QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA STUDENT. DO. WE HAVE A MOTION. IN A MOTION BY. MR LOW SECOND BY DOCTORS QUIRK I I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ALSO FOR BRINGING FORWARD -- AND THANK THE STUDENTS.

EXEMPLARY STUDENTS AND A AND AND I THINK AS AS WE YOU KNOW GO THROUGH THIS. IT'S GOOD TO REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE. MANY MORE STUDENTS LIKE THE STUDENT SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. WHO DID ALL THE RIGHT THINGS AND ARE THERE BY THEIR OWN HARD WORK -- I KNOW THAT -- YOU SEE IS AGAIN STILL IN THE PROCESS THAT THEY'VE BEGUN I SAT NEXT TO I HAD THE CHANCE TO SIT NEXT TO THE DEAN OF ADMISSIONS -- RECENTLY -- IT UC RIVERSIDE.
