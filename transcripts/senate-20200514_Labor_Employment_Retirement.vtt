INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHAT IT

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:04.128
IS THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T WANT TO

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.898
PROMOTE- ABIDE BY THE VARIOUS

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.933
LAWS HIM PROTECTIONS THAT WE

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:28.586
THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS- THAT

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:31.222
ISN'T ACTUALLY CORRECT I DO NOT

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.223
BELIEVE WHAT I DO THINK IT'S

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.492
PART OF THE PROBLEM. IS THAT

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.360
EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:39.330
HIRE THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:40.031
THEY DON'T WANT TO MEET THE

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:42.033
REQUIREMENTS OF A REAL

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:43.668

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:45.169
BEING SAID THERE ARE SOME

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:47.305

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.545
KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE-

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.180
INTERPRETERS. WHO HAVE

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:58.449
LEGITIMATELY HAVE THEIR OWN

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:01.285
BUSINESSES THE PROBLEM IS HOW

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:03.321
DO WE DISTINGUISH AND I WOULD

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:04.956
STAY I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.758
ANSWER. I DO HOPE THAT WOULD TO

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:09.860
THAT SOLUTION BUT I DO BELIEVE

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:12.463
THE WATERS HAPPENED IN TODAY'S

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.499
WORLD IS THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:19.103
TOO FAR OVER. INTO THE

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.405
INDEPENDENT OCEAN EVERYBODY IS

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:25.576
IN IT PANIC CONTRA. AND ALSO

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:26.344
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A BIGGER

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.447
ARMY THEY HAVE THE BENEFIT IN

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:40.524
THE RIGHT IN THE. SO I WANT TO

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.360
RECOGNIZE THE FRUSTRATIONS A

00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.728
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WHO FOR THE

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.896
LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE THOUGHT

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.198
THAT THEY WERE INDEPENDENT

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.499
CONTRACTORS HAVE BEEN ABLE

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:50.601
BECAUSE HIM BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:54.271
ENFORCED. THE LAWS OF EMPLOYER

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.841
EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP AND THAT

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:59.343
NOW THAT THERE IS THIS A COURT

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.079
DECISION WHICH AB FIVE IS

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:05.082
ESSENTIALLY RESPONDING TO-

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:07.051
PEOPLE WHO. THOUGHT THAT THEY

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:08.586

BUT THAT ISN'T TRUE. THE POOR

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:27.571
THE POINT IS THAT EMPLOYERS

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:29.106
DON'T WANT TO HIRE THEM THEY

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:30.675

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.506
WHERE WE HAVE WE HAVE CREATED

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:48.110
IT. A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.546
HAVE CERTAIN RISKS AND WE

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:52.548
DETERMINED THAT BECAUSE OF

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:53.716
THOSE RISK THEY SHOULD GET A

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:55.484
PRESUMPTION AND THEN WE HAVE

01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:57.886
ANOTHER GROUP. THAT WHEN YOU

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:58.854
LOOK AT THE KIND OF RISK THAT

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.490
THEY UNDERGO THEY'RE EXACTLY

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:03.192
THE SAME WITH WITH SOME

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.259
DIFFERENCE THEY'RE NOT OUT ON

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.928
THE STREETS RUNNING AROUND BUT

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:11.700
THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE-SAME. INJURIES THE SAME BODY

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:15.004
FLUIDS THE SAME. DISEASES AND

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.039
IT'S IT I LIKE AND IT I LIKEN

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.941
IT VERY MUCH TO THE SITUATION

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:20.209
IT'S CREATED WHEN WE TAKE A

01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:22.344
LOOK AT JOB CLASSIFICATIONS AND

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:24.980
WE'VE WE'VE CREATED A BENEFIT

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.482
THAT ONE GROUP GETS AND WHEN

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.017
YOU START LOOKING AT THE JOBS

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:29.551
THAT THEY DO. YOU FIND OUT THAT

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.786
THEY'RE DOING THE EXACT SAME

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:33.055
JOBS BUT ONE GROUP IS A GROUP

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.456
OF WOMEN AND THEY'RE GETTING

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.592
PAID TWO THIRDS WHAT THE OTHER

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.661
GROUP IT'S DOING THE EXACT SAME

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.796
WORK AT THE EXACT SAME. JOB

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.698
DUTIES BUT THEY'RE GETTING PAID

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.566
MUCH MORE AND SO THIS IS IT

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:47.169
THIS IS A SITUATION OF EQUITY.

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:49.838
AND THE EQUITY SAYS WHY IS IT

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.839
THAT THERE'S THAT THAT THE

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:52.241
GROUP THE FIRST RESPONDERS ON

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:55.511
THE SCENE. GET THE BED THAT GET

PIT. OFF GROUP THEN HAS TO

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.620
BRIGHTEST ALL IN BY WHAT DO

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.889
WITH THE IN. WE ATE OH BY YOUR

01:12:06.955 --> 01:12:07.423
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IN THE

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.390
PRIVATE SECTOR AND DE BECAUSE

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:09.958
YOU'RE YOUR YOUR JOB IS

01:12:10.025 --> 01:12:12.695
DIFFERENT THAN THE PEOPLE THAT

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.463
ARE ON THE FRONTLINE MOTHER ALL

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.432
ON THE FRONT LINE AND THERE

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:20.836
THEIR RESEARCH. SAME DISEASE

01:12:20.903 --> 01:12:23.105
PAGE. THEY INJURED. THE SAME

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.006
INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS TO BE.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.674
DID AND MOVE. AND TREAT. AND

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.443
THE SAME BODILY FLUIDS AND I

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:29.211
AND TO ME IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:30.879
TO MAKE SENSE THAT WE WOULDN'T.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.848
AT LEAST CONSIDER. THAT THE

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:35.084
PRESUMPTION MAKES SENSE FOR ONE

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.552
GROUP WHY IT SHOULD NOT MAKE

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.520
SENSE FOR THE OTHER GROUP AS

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.522
WELL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.790
WE MISSED BECAUSE OF THE

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:44.860
TRUNCATED- TESTIMONY IS

01:12:44.927 --> 01:12:47.062

EXPERIENCES WHERE THEIR HR TO

01:12:50.566 --> 01:12:51.834
PRESSURES THEM TO USE VACATION

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.769
TIME AND THEIR OWN INSURANCE

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.471
RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH A

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:56.939
WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. WHERE THE

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:59.241
INTIMIDATION NOT TO FILE A

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.510

STORIES FROM REAL NURSES AND-

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:17.059
AND THE- THE QUESTION BECOMES.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.228
YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE SYSTEM

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:21.363

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:22.331
THEIR BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:25.667
ENTITLED TO WHICH IS- THE KINDS

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:26.935
OF BENEFITS THAT WILL ALLOW

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:30.839

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.708

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:45.154
ARGUMENT FOR. YOU KNOW REALIZE

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.323
THAT NO BILL IS PERFECT- TYSON

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.857
COMPASS EVERYTHING SO NOT

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:51.560
ASKING THAT. BUT ARE YOU SAYING

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.128
THEREFORE WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:54.930
WORKERS COMP SYSTEM IN A WAY

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:59.168
THAT WE- PEOPLE. THAT EVERYONE

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:01.436

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:03.372
GET REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. BUT

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:04.640
I'M WHAT I'M SAYING TODAY IS

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:05.908
JUST THAT WE TAKE ONE SMALL

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.476
LITTLE STEP- MADE IT TO STEPS

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:08.844

HEALTH HEALTH CARE THIS ALL

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:13.315
GOES AWAY BECAUSE THEN WE DON'T

01:14:13.382 --> 01:14:14.483
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT A WORKERS

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:16.518

THEY WERE NOT. GET BEING GIVEN-

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.113
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.849
APPROPRIATE RECOGNITION FOR THE

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.116
FOR THE FACT THAT THEIR JOBS

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:52.354

ONE AND THAT THE SECOND ONE IS.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:18.887
TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT THE SECOND

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:19.654
ONE WAS THAT I WAS TALKING

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:20.622

DEAL WITH THAT. SO FIRST WAS

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.836

HE SAID HE WAS A MAN IN THAT

01:25:04.332 --> 01:25:07.001
OUT BUT YOU'RE NOT. MANY KNOW

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:13.975
THAT WASN'T ONE OF OKAY. WITH

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.177
THE A SYMPTOMATIC COVERAGE.

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:17.979
OKAY TO ME WITH THAT IF IT DOES

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:20.315
IF IT INCLUDES THE REAL

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:21.216
INCLUDES IF YOU'RE A

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:26.287
SYMPTOMATIC- AND THEN GET GET

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.857
THE- DOT VANIK IT COVERS YOU

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.158
KNOW WILL BE RELATED THAT IS

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.293
CORRECT IN AND SO INSTEAD OF IT

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.029
SAYING IN IN A SYMPTOMATIC- YOU

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:37.131
WOULD IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT YOU

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:37.732
HAVE TO TAKE THE TEST AND THE

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.701
TO BE POSITIVE. GOT IT SO FROM

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:46.040
YOUR PERSPECTIVE. HOW DOES. IN

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.609
THIS ASPECT OF YOUR BILL

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:49.677
DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.479
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.381
THE OTHER BILLS THAT ARE COMING

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.049
THROUGH FOCUSING ON COAL BID

01:25:55.116 --> 01:25:56.918
HELLO SO THE TWO THINGS THAT IT

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.186
DOES IS INCLUDES MUSCO

01:25:58.253 --> 01:26:03.224
SKELETAL- AND- AND THE- AND

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:07.529
INFECTIOUS DISEASES RIGHT AND-

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:09.197
THIS WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.566
UNTIL AFTER. JANUARY FIRST OF

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:14.302
NEXT YEAR. I IT'S NOT AN

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:17.739
URGENCY BILL- AND SO IT TO THE

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:18.907
ANTICIPATED THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.341
IF THERE'S A RECALL IF THERE'S

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:23.011
A NEED FOR HIM TO CONTINUE HIS

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:23.578
EXECUTIVE ORDER HE'LL DO IT

01:26:23.645 --> 01:26:27.982
RIGHT. SO HELP ME I'VE GOT A

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:29.817
LETTER FROM MY HOME COUNTY.

01:26:29.884 --> 01:26:34.622
THAT FOCUSES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:38.159
BUT DURING THAT AND- YOU KNOW

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:41.095
RUNNING A LARGE. COUNTY HEALTH

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.597
SYSTEM THEY GIVE LOTS OF

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:46.334
STATISTICS AW AND PRICE TAGS

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.703
AROUND IF YOUR BILL WERE TO

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.371
BECOME LAW WHAT WOULD YOUR

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:52.507
COUNTER TO THAT BE NOT THIS LA

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:54.409
COUNTY BUT ANY COUNTY OR ANY

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.477
LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM. I THINK

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.947
THERE'S A COUPLE OF ASSUMPTIONS

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.682
THAT ARE THAT ARE BUILT INTO

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:01.749
THE LETTERS THAT I RECEIVED IN

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:04.018
THAT IT LOOKED AT ONE IS THAT-

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:06.854
IS THAT IT IS AND- I THINK THAT

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:09.324
THE WORD THEY WERE USING WAS A

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:12.126
CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION. THAT

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:14.095
THAT'S NOT ANTICIPATED BY THE

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:15.663
BILL AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.733
POLICE OR FIRE HAVE EITHER-

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.935
THAT IS A STANDARD THAT IS

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.437
PULLED OUT OF SOMEWHERE AND

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.339
STUCK IN FRONT OF A IN FRONT OF

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:26.908
THE LANGUAGE OF THAT WORKERS

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:30.678
COMP IN SO THAT. WOULD I THINK

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:31.980
BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.983
YOU CAN'T PRESENT ANY TESTIMONY

01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.651
TO OVERCOME THAT KIND OF THAT

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:37.452
PRESUMPTION AND THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:39.153
IT'S WHAT'S INTENDED. BUT THEN

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.421
THEN THEY USE THE LANGUAGE THAT

01:27:40.488 --> 01:27:43.558
IS A STRICT LIABILITY- AND THIS

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:45.660
ISN'T STRICT LIABILITY THIS IS

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:46.527
THIS IT THERE'S IT'S A

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:48.262
PRESUMPTION AND THE DIFFERENCE

01:27:48.329 --> 01:27:49.564
BETWEEN STRICT LIABILITY IN

01:27:49.631 --> 01:27:50.932
PRESUMPTION IS IT STRICTLY BE

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.467
THE BILL ANY MEANS HOW YOU PAY

01:27:52.533 --> 01:27:53.668
FOR IT NO MATTER WHAT. WHICH IS

01:27:53.735 --> 01:27:54.836
WHAT GETS YOU INTO THE

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.904
CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION AS WELL

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.973
SO WORDS BECOME IMPORTANT- THIS

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.442
IS NOT A STRICT LIABILITY ISSUE

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:04.379
IT'S EASY TO A PORTION- THERE

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.614
THE RISKS. ACCORDING TO YOU

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:07.582
KNOW IF YOU WORK FOR A NUMBER

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.917
OF DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION- IT'S

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:13.554
DONE ALL THE TIME AND SO- THAT

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:16.324
TO MEET IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE-

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.526
A REAL ISSUE BUT BUT LET ME

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:19.927
JUST SAY THAT THAT. YOU KNOW ON

01:28:19.994 --> 01:28:23.197
THE ONE HAND IT'S ARGUED. THAT

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:25.700
NURSES ARE ALREADY- HELP YOU

01:28:25.767 --> 01:28:26.901
KNOW FIRST LINE HELP HELP

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.736
HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE ALREADY

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:30.405
GETTING ALL OF THE BENEFITS BET

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:33.675
BET. THAT DATE THERE'S NO ONE.

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.443
RED IS NOT RECEIVING THE

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.512
BENEFITS THAT DIDN'T. GET IT AT

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:40.314
THE WORK. I'M AND THEN ON THE

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:42.250
SAME TOKEN WHEN THEY SAY WELL

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:43.251
IF YOU DO EVER BUT ABOUT

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.619
PERCEPTION. THEN ALL OF A

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.287
SUDDEN THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.157
MORE COSTS I WOULD ARGUE THAT-

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:51.759
THAT IS A KNEE JERK REACTION.

01:28:51.826 --> 01:28:53.995
TO A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM AND

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:56.597
I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S TRUE.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:57.131
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE ALREADY

01:28:57.198 --> 01:29:00.068
GETTING. THE BENEFITS THEN HOW

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.903
CAN IT GO UP WHEN THEY YOU GET

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:03.171
THE CONCLUSIVE PRESUMPTION WITH

01:29:03.237 --> 01:29:04.472
THAT I'M NOT CONCLUSIVE THE

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:06.307
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION WHAT.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:08.543
THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION DOES

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:09.844
IS IT KEEPS YOU OUT OF THAT

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:12.146
WHOLE SYSTEM. OF DOING THE

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.581
MEDICAL REVIEW AND IF YOU'VE

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:15.983
EVER TALKED TO A WORKER THAT'S

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:16.851
GONE THROUGH THAT MEDICAL

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.486
REVIEW PROCESS WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:19.554
YOUR DOCTOR TAKES A LOOK AT

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.356
YOU. EXAMINED YOU DOES A REPORT

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.025
SENDS IT INTO WORKERS COMP AND

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.194
WORKERS COMP SENDS IT OUT TO AN

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.563
OUT OF STATE DOCTOR. WHO JUST

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:29.597
LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK AND

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.899
DETERMINES WHETHER WHAT WHAT

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.000
YOUR DOCTOR SAID IS TRUE OR NOT

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.669
AND WHETHER. YOU'RE HURTING

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:36.671
LIKE YOU SAY OR NOT AND THAT

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:38.906
COSTS MONEY AND THAT DELAYS THE

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:41.843
SYSTEM AND IT IT- IT'S A IT'S A

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.411
BURDEN ON THE SYSTEM IN YES

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:46.280
IT'S USED TO WEED OUT FRAUD.

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:48.549
BUT BUT IN IN THIS KIND OF AN

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:51.919
INSTANCE IF IN FACT THE NURSES

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:52.854
ARE ALREADY GETTING THERE'S

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.789
BENEFITS WHAT'S THE ADDITIONAL

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:55.923
COST YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.191
MONEY BY NOT SENDING IT OUT FOR

01:29:57.258 --> 01:30:00.595
THESE. MEDICAL REVIEW SO I

01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:01.996
THINK PART OF IT IS JUST A KNEE

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.631
JERK REACTION TO A SITUATION

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:05.600
THAT TO CHANGE AND I GET THE

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.001
CHANGE MAKES PEOPLE REALLY

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.871
NERVOUS IN IN A BUSINESS-

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:11.205
ENVIRONMENT YOU WANT CERTAINTY

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:14.208
BUT- BUT I IT'S THIS IS ONE OF

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:16.711
THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE- AT. I

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:18.312
FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.915
WE'VE SET UP A SYSTEM IN THE

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.584
SYSTEM IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE. FOR

01:30:23.651 --> 01:30:26.721
GUN AT. I RECOGNIZE A BENEFIT

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.589
FOR ONE MORE GROUP OF WORKERS

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:32.894
AND THE AND THE SAME. THE SAME

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.928
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.830
TRANSFERRED INJURED AND

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:37.765
INFECTIOUS TO ANOTHER GROUP AND

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.233
THEY'RE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.334
IN ACTUALLY SPENDING A WHOLE

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.903
HECK OF A LOT MORE TIME THAN

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.571
THE POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.573
THEN IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.208
TO ME NOT TO. NOT TO DO IT. IF

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:55.716
I MAY WITH CHAIR- BUT I REALLY

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.451
JUST LOSE MY QUESTION ON MY OWN

01:30:57.518 --> 01:31:01.322
PIECE OF PAPER. AT ONE THING I

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:04.025
WOULD SAY I THINK. FROM MY

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:06.360
PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL DOES

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:08.362
NOTHING WITH REGARD TO THE

01:31:08.429 --> 01:31:11.599
PROVISION OF PP I JUST THINK

01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:12.633
YOU KNOW WE HEARD THIS BILL

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.001
LAST YEAR AND WHILE I

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:16.370
APPRECIATE THE ADDITION OF COLD

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:17.305
IT TOO AND I THINK THAT'S

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.073
APPROPRIATE IN KEEPING WITH THE

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.341
OTHER BILLS AS WELL AS

01:31:20.408 --> 01:31:22.743
EXECUTIVE ORDER I JUST. I DON'T

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:24.879
WANT US TO COMBINE THE A MOTION

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:26.447
THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.282
RECOGNIZING THAT NURSES ARE

01:31:28.349 --> 01:31:29.016
PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:33.688
EVERY DAY WITH THIS- DIFFERENT

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.790
YET SIMILAR PUBLIC POLICY

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:38.326
DISCUSSION THIS WILL THIS THE

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.293
EIGHT WE LOOK VOTE THIS BILL

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.595
OUT TODAY WILL HAVE NOTHING TO

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:42.430
DO WITH MORE PP COMING INTO

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:43.764
HOSPITALS FOR NURSES I JUST

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.300
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:48.836
SEPARATE. WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:49.937
FROM THE EMOTION OF WHAT WE'RE

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.205
ALL EXPERIENCING I JUST FELT

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:53.808
THE NEED TO SAY THAT- I WAS

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.343
STRUCK BY THE NOTION I

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:58.312
APPRECIATE THAT IS ANECDOTAL-

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:01.415
THAT NURSES ARE BEING-

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:04.685
ENCOURAGED TO. NOT FOLLOW KIND

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:06.287
OF CURRENT PROTOCOL WITH REGARD

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:07.555
TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM AND

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.957
BEING TOLD TO TAKE THEIR OWN

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.593
PERSONAL TIME AND SICK TIME.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.696
AND IF THE CHAIR WOULD ALLOW-

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.131
IN THE OF THE- THOSE IN

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:19.467
OPPOSITION COULD COMMENT ON

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:28.142

FOR ME TO RESPOND- BUT WHAT I

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:46.961
AM AWARE OF ITS EARLY AND

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.262
ANYTHING THAT WAS AGAIN TO THE

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:50.798
COVERT SITUATION. EARLY IN THE

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:55.102
SITUATION THERE WAS A LOT OF.

CHANGING GUIDANCE ON INFECTION

01:32:58.172 --> 01:33:00.207
CONTROL AND YOU KNOW I MEAN

01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:01.976
FROM THE CDC AND CITY PH AND

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:04.412
CAL OSHA AND THE GOVERNOR. AND

01:33:04.478 --> 01:33:08.416
SO- SOME EMPLOYERS MIGHT HAVE.

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:11.552
HAD EMPLOYEES. USE THEIR PAID

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:14.355
TIME OFF EARLY IN THE PROCESS I

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.890
THINK IT'S TIME MOVE DONE

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:18.960
FRANKLY MOST HOSPITALS ACTUALLY

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:21.529
MOVED TO A SITUATION WHERE THEY

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:22.363
WERE EITHER GIVING ADDITIONAL

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:25.132
TIME. I'M SORRY COATED-

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:27.401
SPECIFIC RELATED PAID TIME OFF

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:30.371
OF SOMEBODY WAS L. FOR HER IF.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.273
WORKERS COMP CLAIMS ARE FILED

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.075
THEY WERE ACCEPTING THEM- AND

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.743
THIS IS PARTICULARLY AFTER THE

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:38.012
CHILDREN PLACE ORDER- YOU KNOW

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.613
WHERE PEOPLE WERE REALLY.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.481
LEAVING THEIR HOMES TO GO TO

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.149
WORK SO IT'S HARD TO RESPOND TO

01:33:42.216 --> 01:33:43.985
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T HAVE THE

01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.953

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN EARLY ON BUT

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:48.622
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHERE

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.291
THINGS ENDED UP. AND THAT'S NOT

01:33:50.358 --> 01:33:51.392
WHERE THEY ARE NOT OBVIOUSLY

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:52.159
BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.494

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:07.394
THE NEED FOR THE PRESUMPTIONS

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.330
THE DATA IT IS WE JUST CAN'T

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:11.365
SEE IT SUPPORTS THAT. THERE MAY

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:12.800
BE OTHER REASONS THAT PEOPLE

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.969
THINK OR ANECDOTALLY WHY THERE

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.470
SHOULD BE BUT THE DATA IS WHAT

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.072
WE'RE TRYING TO GO BY TODAY AND

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.240
WELL I AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF

01:36:19.306 --> 01:36:21.609

COVERT NINETEEN. OPTIONS I

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:25.713
THINK THAT THEY GO TOO FAR EVEN

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:27.248
IF YOU ADDRESS THE NOVEL

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.917

DIRECTORS TOO MUCH WITHIN IT IT

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:36.690
DOESN'T GO BECAUSE BEYOND THE

01:36:36.757 --> 01:36:39.226
GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:40.694
I BELIEVE A PRESUMPTION NEEDS

01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:42.429
TO HAVE A SUNSET. BECAUSE OF

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:43.831

DIFFERENT. THAN IT IS TODAY.

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:50.104

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.574
WELL AS THE PRESUMPTIONS AS THE

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:55.209
REALITY CHANGES AS WE DEAL

DURING THIS TIME IT IS CRITICAL

03:04:03.932 --> 03:04:05.901
THAT WE PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS

03:06:25.908 --> 03:06:27.809
PROVEN IMPACT BUT BUT THE PLAIN

03:06:27.876 --> 03:06:30.445
FACT IS. PEOPLE CAN ONLY

03:06:30.512 --> 03:06:31.914

BY VERY COMPELLING DATA. THE

THIS BASIC SUPPORT IS THE

LEADING CAUSE OF LOW INCOME

A LACK OF COMMITMENT OF ABILITY

03:06:52.134 --> 03:06:53.869
IT'S A LACK OF VERY BASIC

03:06:53.936 --> 03:06:55.737

03:06:55.804 --> 03:06:57.339

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:18.372
REBUTTAL PRESUMPTION MAKES A

03:25:18.439 --> 03:25:19.740
LOT OF SENSE. BUT WE DO HAVE

03:25:19.807 --> 03:25:21.342
SOME PECIFIC CONCERNS WITH

03:25:21.409 --> 03:25:22.309
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ITSELF

03:25:22.376 --> 03:25:24.011

03:25:29.517 --> 03:25:30.985
MAKE MORE SENSE TO HELP REDUCE

COSTS IN A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM

ABOUT A COUPLE OF BROAD

03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:20.661
PRINCIPLES. OTHER WERE

03:27:20.728 --> 03:27:21.829
CONTAINED IN THE LETTER THAT WE

SENT A SIMILAR LETTER TO THE

03:27:24.765 --> 03:27:26.200
GOVERNOR AT FIRST I WOULD JUST

03:27:26.267 --> 03:27:28.269
OBSERVE BROADLY- THAT THE

03:27:28.335 --> 03:27:29.670

03:27:29.737 --> 03:27:31.238
A SYSTEM JUST LIKE ANY OTHER-

03:27:35.176 --> 03:27:36.177
THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE RIGHT

03:27:36.243 --> 03:27:37.845
THERE'S ALWAYS A LINE- BECAUSE

03:27:37.912 --> 03:27:39.146
THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO

03:27:39.213 --> 03:27:40.815
SERVICE VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE

03:27:40.881 --> 03:27:42.883
AND IN THIS. INSTANCE THE

03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:46.120
SPECIFIC PURPOSE IS WORKPLACE

03:27:46.187 --> 03:27:47.922
INJURIES AND ILLNESSES OKAY

03:27:47.988 --> 03:27:49.256

03:27:49.323 --> 03:27:50.424
ABOUT A PRESUMPTION OR WERE

03:27:50.491 --> 03:27:51.492
HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT

03:27:51.559 --> 03:27:52.593
CHANGING KIND OF THE

03:27:52.660 --> 03:27:54.395
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD FOR HOW

03:27:54.461 --> 03:27:56.363
YOU ACCESS THAT SYSTEM WHAT

03:27:56.430 --> 03:27:57.932
YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS

03:27:57.998 --> 03:28:00.501
WHAT FILTER YOU ARE YOU USING

03:28:00.568 --> 03:28:01.535
TO EITHER ALLOW PEOPLE IN OR

03:28:01.602 --> 03:28:02.937
KEEP THEM OUT AND IT'S JUST

03:28:03.003 --> 03:28:04.205
THAT IT'S THAT SIMPLE SO AGAIN

03:28:04.271 --> 03:28:05.472
WE WOULD WE WOULD BE VERY HARD

03:28:05.539 --> 03:28:07.341
ON. THIS THE FILTERS SHOULD

03:28:07.408 --> 03:28:09.910
KEEP OUT THE NON WORK RELATED

03:28:09.977 --> 03:28:11.846
INJURIES SO ON A COUPLE OF

03:28:11.912 --> 03:28:13.948
SPECIFIC ISSUES CONCLUSIVE

03:28:14.014 --> 03:28:15.316
VERSES REBUTTABLE PASSED OF

03:28:15.382 --> 03:28:17.051
PRESUMPTIONS A CONCLUSIVE

03:28:17.117 --> 03:28:18.252
PRESUMPTION WOULD SAY

03:28:18.319 --> 03:28:20.688
ESSENTIALLY ON EVEN IF I HAD

03:28:20.754 --> 03:28:22.656
INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATED

03:28:22.723 --> 03:28:24.358
WITH ABSOLUTE CLARITY THAT

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:25.292
YOU'RE COVERED NINETEEN FACTION

03:28:25.359 --> 03:28:27.361
WAS NOT CONTRACTED IN THE

03:28:27.428 --> 03:28:29.196
WORKPLACE BUT RATHER IT WAS

03:28:29.263 --> 03:28:29.930
CONTRACTED SOMEWHERE ELSE THERE

03:28:29.997 --> 03:28:30.898
IS EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT. I

03:28:30.965 --> 03:28:32.499
COULD NOT BRING THAT FORWARD AS

03:28:32.566 --> 03:28:34.034
AN EMPLOYER TO REBUT YOUR

03:28:34.101 --> 03:28:35.736
PRESUMPTION AND MOVE THAT

03:28:35.803 --> 03:28:37.471
INFECTION OUT OF THE WORKERS

03:28:37.538 --> 03:28:38.606
COMPENSATION SYSTEM MAYBE INTO

03:28:38.672 --> 03:28:40.140
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- THAT I

03:28:40.207 --> 03:28:42.509
PROVIDE OR OR SOME OTHER SYSTEM

03:28:42.576 --> 03:28:44.278
WE THINK THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL

03:28:44.345 --> 03:28:46.914
VIOLATION OF A HUNDRED YEARS OF

03:28:46.981 --> 03:28:48.382
WORKERS COMPENSATION LAW- IT

03:28:48.449 --> 03:28:49.650
NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT IN

03:28:49.717 --> 03:28:51.652
THIS COUNTRY- IT WOULD BE A

03:28:51.719 --> 03:28:53.787
GROSS VIOLATION OF WHAT THE

03:28:53.854 --> 03:28:55.623
SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO DO- SO WE

03:28:55.689 --> 03:28:59.660
OBVIOUSLY WOULD NOT. SUPPORT

03:28:59.727 --> 03:29:01.128
THAT. WHAT MAKES A CLAY IS IN

03:29:01.195 --> 03:29:02.863
AND- QUESTION SO DOESN'T

03:29:02.930 --> 03:29:04.398
EXPOSURE OR A PERCEIVED

03:29:04.465 --> 03:29:07.134
EXPOSURE- TO MAKE A CLAIM- WE

03:29:07.201 --> 03:29:09.036
WOULD SUBMIT THAT IT DOES NOT-

03:29:09.103 --> 03:29:09.937
DO YOU SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE A

03:29:10.004 --> 03:29:11.438
POSITIVE TEST OR A PHYSICIAN'S

03:29:11.505 --> 03:29:13.707
DIAGNOSIS- SIMILAR TO SOMETHING

03:29:13.774 --> 03:29:14.642
THAT WAS IN THE AT THE

03:29:14.708 --> 03:29:17.111
EXECUTIVE ORDER- BUT SOME LINE

03:29:17.177 --> 03:29:18.913
THERE. A MERE EXPOSURE CAN BE

03:29:18.979 --> 03:29:19.914
DEALT WITH THROUGH THE PAID

03:29:19.980 --> 03:29:20.948
SICK LEAVE BENEFITS THAT WERE

03:29:21.015 --> 03:29:22.182
PROVIDED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

03:29:22.249 --> 03:29:23.651
IN THE STATE LEVEL- AND SOME

03:29:23.717 --> 03:29:24.752
OTHER THINGS SO WITH THAT

03:29:24.818 --> 03:29:26.587
SHOULDN'T CONSTITUTE A CLAIM-

03:29:26.654 --> 03:29:27.922
THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS

03:29:27.988 --> 03:29:29.990
ABOUT- EXTENDING STATUTORY

03:29:30.057 --> 03:29:30.991

03:29:31.058 --> 03:29:32.359
MEASURES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

03:29:32.426 --> 03:29:33.894
THAT DON'T STICK WITH THE

03:29:33.961 --> 03:29:35.462
MEDICAL CARE INDEMNITY BENEFITS

03:29:35.529 --> 03:29:36.363
AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

03:29:36.430 --> 03:29:37.464
PROVIDED BY THE WORKERS

03:29:37.531 --> 03:29:38.599
COMPENSATION SYSTEM BUT THEY

03:29:38.666 --> 03:29:40.868
TRY TO EXPAND IT TO HOUSING AND

03:29:40.935 --> 03:29:41.535
LIVING EXPENSES AND EVERY.

03:29:41.602 --> 03:29:43.570
OTHER THINGS I WE OBVIOUSLY

03:51:27.707 --> 03:51:29.041
UNION COULD SIMPLY FILE SUIT

03:51:29.108 --> 03:51:30.476

COMPLIANCE- WITH THE STATE LAW-

03:51:33.613 --> 03:51:34.880

WHILE IBM. HAD IT SHARE SOME

CONCERN ABOUT USING PUBLIC

DOLLARS. I DO KNOW THAT THIS

03:53:57.757 --> 03:53:59.258
BILL DOES PROVIDE FOR AN

03:53:59.325 --> 03:54:01.327
OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. AND I

03:54:01.394 --> 03:54:02.695
THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

03:54:02.762 --> 03:54:04.563
IN THIS SITUATION IF INDEED

03:54:04.630 --> 03:54:05.965

03:54:07.032 --> 03:54:08.701
INADVERTENT SOMEONE'S GOING TO

03:54:08.768 --> 03:54:09.435
HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE

03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:11.270
TAXPAYERS WHY THAT MONEY IS

03:54:11.337 --> 03:54:14.407
BEING SPENT- TO COMPLY WERE IS

03:54:14.473 --> 03:54:15.875
A SANCTION A PENALTY FOR NOT

03:54:15.941 --> 03:54:17.576
COMPLYING WITH THE LAW SO. I

03:54:17.643 --> 03:54:20.012
THINK IT'S A VERY REASONABLE.

03:54:20.079 --> 03:54:22.348
APPROACH TO A PROBLEM THAT-

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:24.950
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NO TEETH AND

03:54:25.017 --> 03:54:27.286
THE YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE ALL

03:54:27.353 --> 03:54:28.854
EXPERIENCED A SORT OF A- A

03:54:28.921 --> 03:54:31.891
BEING SHINED ON A BY AGENCIES

03:54:31.957 --> 03:54:33.492
CENTER FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

03:54:33.559 --> 03:54:35.227
BUT IT'S JUST NOT APPROPRIATE

03:54:35.294 --> 03:54:36.595
AND IT'S KIND OF CONTRARY TO

03:54:36.662 --> 03:54:39.064
THE LAW. SO I THINK- THIS MAKES

03:54:39.131 --> 03:54:40.132
SENSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD

03:54:40.199 --> 03:54:43.602

03:55:08.360 --> 03:55:08.894
THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD ADDRESS

03:55:08.961 --> 03:55:10.663
SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. BUT

03:55:10.729 --> 03:55:12.298

03:55:24.677 --> 03:55:26.145
HAVE TO BE VOTING NO ON THE

03:55:26.212 --> 03:55:27.146
BILL TODAY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

03:55:27.213 --> 03:55:29.615
BILL THAT CREATES A RIGHT TO

MONETARY PENALTIES FOR THOSE

03:55:37.456 --> 03:55:38.924
PUBLIC AGENCIES BECAUSE THEY

03:55:38.991 --> 03:55:39.859
DIDN'T HAND OVER EMPLOYEE

CONTACT AT A TO THE UNION

03:55:41.660 --> 03:55:43.429
QUICKLY ENOUGH. REPUBLICAN

03:55:43.496 --> 03:55:45.130
LAWYERS AND PARTNERS ARE

03:55:45.197 --> 03:55:46.332
BUCKLING UNDER THE SOCIAL

03:55:46.398 --> 03:55:47.199
HEALTH AND ECONOMIC

ATTACKED. THE COST OF INCREASED

03:55:53.038 --> 03:55:53.539
SUBSTANTIALLY AND SO HAS THE

03:55:53.606 --> 03:55:55.374
WORKLOAD. MEANWHILE WHETHER

03:55:55.441 --> 03:55:56.609
EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO

03:55:56.675 --> 03:55:58.143
ADAPT TO WORKING FROM HOME OR

WITH UNFAMILIAR TECHNOLOGY

03:55:59.845 --> 03:56:01.313
SEPARATED FROM THEIR COLLEAGUES

03:56:01.380 --> 03:56:02.281
THEIR OFFICES IN THEIR NORMAL

03:56:02.348 --> 03:56:04.016
RESOURCES ALL WATCH WHILE

03:56:04.083 --> 03:56:05.184
TRYING TO CONFRONT THE

03:56:05.251 --> 03:56:06.819
CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC I

03:56:06.886 --> 03:56:08.921
FIND IT PUZZLING. THAT WE WOULD

03:56:08.988 --> 03:56:10.556
TAKE THIS MOMENT. TO MAKE THEM

03:56:10.623 --> 03:56:11.857
MORE VULNERABLE TO FURTHER

03:56:11.924 --> 03:56:13.659
REVENUE LOSSES AND FRANKLY

03:56:13.726 --> 03:56:16.362
LITIGIOUS TIMES SUCKS TICKET

03:56:16.428 --> 03:56:18.197
OUR UNION FRIENDS INFORMATION.

03:56:18.264 --> 03:56:19.298
THAT THEY COULD GET THROUGH

03:56:19.365 --> 03:56:20.799
THEIR OWN EFFORTS AND MOSTLY DO

03:56:20.866 --> 03:56:23.402
GET FROM MOST PUBLIC EMPLOYERS.

03:56:23.469 --> 03:56:25.204
I DON'T ASSURE GOOD THIS THIS

03:56:25.271 --> 03:56:27.206
THIS BILL IS CREATING A PRIVATE

PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES. AND

03:56:31.176 --> 03:56:32.011
THAT IS GOING TO LEAD TO

03:56:32.077 --> 03:56:34.380
GREATER PURPOSE CHARGE WHEN WE

03:56:34.446 --> 03:56:36.282
KNOW THAT PURPLE ALREADY LIKELY

03:56:36.348 --> 03:56:38.484
SEE INCREASED WORKLOAD FROM THE

03:56:38.551 --> 03:56:39.718

03:56:39.785 --> 03:56:41.487
DISRUPTIONS THAT ARE TAKING

PLACE ACROSS OUR PUBLIC SECTOR.

03:56:43.422 --> 03:56:44.356
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC

03:56:44.423 --> 03:56:45.758
BECAUSE IT REQUIRES PERPETUAL

MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS AND IT

04:20:56.540 --> 04:20:57.942

JUST GO OUT. TO HOMES AND CHECK

04:25:37.688 --> 04:25:39.790
YOU OUT AND SEE WHAT ARE YOUR

04:25:39.857 --> 04:25:41.458

04:25:45.996 --> 04:25:48.065
WILL DO IS ISSUE THE GUIDANCE.

04:25:48.132 --> 04:25:50.034
FOR THAT INDUSTRY. SO THEY'LL

04:25:50.100 --> 04:25:51.669
COME UP WITH AND THEY'LL WORK

04:25:51.735 --> 04:25:53.637

SURE THAT YOU KNOW THEY WORK

04:25:57.474 --> 04:25:59.243
TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW

04:25:59.310 --> 04:26:01.979
WHAT OTHER COMMON HAZARDS- HOW

04:26:02.046 --> 04:26:03.580

TO PREVENT INJURIES AND

04:26:12.356 --> 04:26:14.224
ILLNESSES IN THE WORKPLACE. SO

04:26:14.291 --> 04:26:15.926
THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING

04:26:15.993 --> 04:26:18.629
CAL OSHA IS TO HELP BOTH THE

04:26:18.696 --> 04:26:21.231

AND WHICH ONES ARE AND HOW DO

04:26:30.974 --> 04:26:33.877
YOU USE THEM- SO THAT'S THE

04:26:33.944 --> 04:26:35.145
WHOLE POINT OF HAVING AN

04:26:35.212 --> 04:26:37.981
AGENCY. BE ABLE TO GUIDE. THE

04:26:38.048 --> 04:26:41.085

KOW WHAT'S SAFE AND WHAT WHAT

04:26:44.321 --> 04:26:45.756

04:26:45.823 --> 04:26:47.658
PARTICULAR COMPLAINT WHICH IS

04:26:47.725 --> 04:26:50.227

04:26:50.294 --> 04:26:52.062
LOCATION THEN THEY'LL GO OUT

IS TO HAVE BETTER WORKING

JUST TO GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

04:27:17.087 --> 04:27:18.155

CALLOSUM PASSED. FOR EXAMPLE

04:27:23.193 --> 04:27:24.328
WITH ALL THE RECENT WILDFIRES.

04:27:24.395 --> 04:27:25.529
THE BEST WORKERS ARE NOT

STANDARDS- IN TERMS OF BEING

04:27:29.867 --> 04:27:32.403
EXPOSED TO SMOKE FOR EXAMPLE-

04:27:32.469 --> 04:27:35.472
OR EVEN HAPPY SO- WHEN THEY'RE

04:27:35.539 --> 04:27:36.173
THEY ARE WORKING THEN

04:27:36.240 --> 04:27:38.208
EVACUATION DOLLARS. THIS REALLY

04:27:38.275 --> 04:27:39.510
IS ABOUT HOW DO WE ISSUE

04:27:39.576 --> 04:27:42.346
GUIDANCE. TO EMPLOYERS TO WHAT

04:27:42.413 --> 04:27:44.047
THEY HAVE THOSE SO CALLED TO

04:27:44.114 --> 04:27:45.516
UNDERSTAND OUR OBLIGATIONS THIS

04:27:45.582 --> 04:27:47.251
IS NOT ABOUT SENDING PEOPLE TO

04:27:47.317 --> 04:27:49.820
KNOCK ON PEOPLE'S DOORS. OKAY

04:27:49.887 --> 04:27:51.121
NINE I GET THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE

04:27:51.188 --> 04:27:53.157
AREN'T GOING. TO BASICALLY EN

04:27:53.223 --> 04:27:54.825
MASSE GOING BUT WHEN SOMEONE

04:27:54.892 --> 04:27:57.494
FILES A COMPLAINT. THEN SOMEONE

04:27:57.561 --> 04:28:01.198
IS. COMING INTO SOMEONE'S HOME

04:28:01.265 --> 04:28:02.499

BE A PHONE CALL AND OR EMAIL-

04:28:09.773 --> 04:28:11.675
AND THEN IT WILL MOVE FROM

04:28:11.742 --> 04:28:12.843
THERE AND IT IS THAT WE'RE

04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:14.344
GRANT THAT'S YET TO BE DESIGN

04:28:14.411 --> 04:28:16.280
SO JUST LIKE WITH AGRICULTURE.

04:28:16.346 --> 04:28:18.415

WORKERS ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND

04:28:26.156 --> 04:28:28.492
OBLIGATIONS. SO I DON'T THINK

04:28:28.559 --> 04:28:30.160
THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT.

04:28:30.227 --> 04:28:32.062

ITSELF I GUESS WE CAN SAY THAT

04:28:51.181 --> 04:28:52.316
IF YOU HIRE ANYONE TO WORK IN

04:28:52.382 --> 04:28:53.951
YOUR HOUSE I THINK IT GOES TO

04:28:54.017 --> 04:28:56.053
THE NOTED THAT THE NOW YOU

KNOW THE CONCERN WOULD BE. ALSO

04:29:07.364 --> 04:29:12.169
IS THAT- IF. SOMEONE'S HOME- IS

04:29:12.236 --> 04:29:13.837
VIEWED AS BASICALLY A PUBLIC

04:29:13.904 --> 04:29:15.772
SPACE BECAUSE YOU KNOW

04:29:15.839 --> 04:29:17.941
BUSINESSES ARE AT LEAST DOWN ON

04:29:18.008 --> 04:29:18.842
TIGHTLY PUBLIC BUT SOME

04:29:18.909 --> 04:29:20.611
SOMEWHAT MORE PUBLIC THAN OF

04:29:20.677 --> 04:29:23.313
SOMEONE'S RESIDENTS- THEN WOULD

04:29:23.380 --> 04:29:25.516

04:29:56.580 --> 04:29:57.648
TO BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE IN IN

04:29:57.714 --> 04:29:59.016
RELATION TO THE FACT THAT WE

04:29:59.082 --> 04:30:00.384
ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE'S

04:30:00.450 --> 04:30:02.653
HOMES THAT THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO

04:30:02.719 --> 04:30:05.122
HIRE SOMEONE- TO WORK THERE SO

04:30:05.188 --> 04:30:06.557
THAT YOU KNOW IN SOME SENSES

04:30:06.623 --> 04:30:08.425
STATE THE TO MAKE THAT DECISION

04:30:08.492 --> 04:30:10.527
BUT WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE THE

04:30:10.594 --> 04:30:12.162
PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH CAL OSHA

04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:13.897
WOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN

04:30:13.964 --> 04:30:16.333
TERMS OF- BOTH ASSURING THAT

04:30:16.400 --> 04:30:17.801
WORKER SAFETY WHILE ALSO

04:30:17.868 --> 04:30:19.336
ENSURING THE PRIVACY OF THE

04:30:19.403 --> 04:30:22.773
HOMEOWNER AND IT WILL BE OURS

04:30:22.839 --> 04:30:23.807
SO STRIKING THE BALANCE THERE.

04:30:23.874 --> 04:30:26.209
WELL AT. WELL FIRST OF ALL

04:30:26.276 --> 04:30:27.644
THERE'S ALREADY A RELATIONSHIP

04:30:27.711 --> 04:30:28.946
THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE AN

04:30:29.012 --> 04:30:30.647
EMPLOYER IN YOUR SUBJECT TO

04:30:30.714 --> 04:30:32.382
MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME SO

04:30:32.449 --> 04:30:33.984
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN OVER MANY

04:30:34.051 --> 04:30:36.253
YEARS THAT YOU KNOW SLOWLY

04:30:36.320 --> 04:30:38.155
ADDING MORE AND MORE TO THAT

04:30:38.221 --> 04:30:39.489
WHAT THAT RELATIONSHIP IS GOING

04:30:39.556 --> 04:30:41.592
TO BE IT SHOULD BE EVEN THOUGH

04:30:41.658 --> 04:30:44.161
IT'S YOUR HOME IT SHOULD BE UP

04:30:44.227 --> 04:30:45.896
THE LOSSES IS THERE EMPLOYER

04:30:45.963 --> 04:30:48.198
EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP SO THAT'S

04:30:48.265 --> 04:30:49.833
ALREADY THERE REGARDLESS OF

04:30:49.900 --> 04:30:53.236
ADDING BOMB- CAL OSHA- BUT

04:30:53.303 --> 04:30:55.872
AGAIN I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA IS

04:30:55.939 --> 04:30:57.374
WE HAVE TO GIVE CAL OSHA THE

04:30:57.441 --> 04:30:59.610
OPPORTUNITY. TO YOU KNOW

04:30:59.676 --> 04:31:01.278
THEY'RE THE EXPERTS THEY KNOW

04:31:01.345 --> 04:31:03.714
WHAT'S- WHAT'S SAFE THEY KNOW

04:31:03.780 --> 04:31:04.915
WHAT'S HARMFUL THEY KNOW WHAT

04:31:04.982 --> 04:31:07.184

04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:09.086
THE OPPORTUNITY DEVELOP THOSE

04:31:09.152 --> 04:31:10.387
GUIDANCE SO I THINK THE

04:31:10.454 --> 04:31:11.888
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHERE IS THE

04:31:11.955 --> 04:31:14.291
SCOPE OF WHAT WILL THEY COVER

04:31:14.358 --> 04:31:16.059
HOW WILL THEY DO IT WILL COME

04:31:16.126 --> 04:31:18.395
IN THAT PROCESS TO ALLOW CASH

04:31:18.462 --> 04:31:21.565
CAL OSHA TO THE- DEVELOP THAT

04:31:21.632 --> 04:31:23.033
PROCESS AND COME UP WITH MORE

04:31:23.100 --> 04:31:24.267
PARTICULARS I DON'T KNOW HOW WE

04:31:24.334 --> 04:31:25.869
COULD. DEVELOP THOSE

04:31:25.936 --> 04:31:27.604
PARTICULARS AT THIS POINT OTHER

04:31:27.671 --> 04:31:29.840
THAN TO AS CAL OSHA'S THEIR

04:31:29.906 --> 04:31:32.109
AGENCY GIVE IT TO THEM TO

04:31:32.175 --> 04:31:34.578
FIGURE OUT THE DETAILS OF IT

04:31:34.645 --> 04:31:36.313
YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

04:31:36.380 --> 04:31:38.782
THEIR WHOLE POINT WELL IN THE

04:31:38.849 --> 04:31:40.217
ABSENT FISHINGGOLDENSON OUT

04:31:40.283 --> 04:31:41.618
BASICALLY I THINK I THINK MY

04:31:41.685 --> 04:31:43.754
CONCERN IS THAT. IT'S NOT A

04:31:43.820 --> 04:31:46.823
TYPICAL WORKPLACE AND- YES THE

04:31:46.890 --> 04:31:47.924
COLLEGE YOU WILL FIGURE OUT THE

04:31:47.991 --> 04:31:49.793
DETAILS BUT WE MIGHT WANT TO

04:31:49.860 --> 04:31:52.329
PUT SOME GUIDANCE INTO THIS

04:31:52.396 --> 04:31:54.965
BECAUSE OF THE FACT RECOGNIZING

04:31:55.032 --> 04:31:56.933
THAT THIS WORK PLACES ALSO

04:31:57.000 --> 04:31:57.634
SOMEONE'S RESIDENTS AND THERE

04:31:57.701 --> 04:31:59.069

THE HOME THAT MAY NOT QUITE BE

04:32:06.276 --> 04:32:07.310
THE SAME AS SOMEONE GOING TO

OF SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BUT

04:32:16.820 --> 04:32:17.421
SOMEONE WALKING AROUND THE

04:32:17.487 --> 04:32:19.423

LOOKING OUT OF THINGS TO. MADE

04:32:24.061 --> 04:32:27.698

04:32:27.764 --> 04:32:30.000
SOME THAT IN TERMS. WHAT'S

CULTURAL EXPECTATIONS ARE THESE

04:38:19.215 --> 04:38:20.784

04:38:23.887 --> 04:38:25.555
HISTORICALLY AND CULTURALLY

04:38:25.622 --> 04:38:28.691
TEND TO FALL ON MOTHERS. WOMEN

04:38:28.758 --> 04:38:30.593
HAVE ALSO MADE UP 60% OF THE

04:38:30.660 --> 04:38:33.229
JOB LOSSES IN THIS CRISIS AND

04:38:33.296 --> 04:38:34.197
THEIR JOB LOSSES HAVE

04:38:34.264 --> 04:38:37.067
OUTNUMBERED MAN'S IN NEARLY

04:38:37.133 --> 04:38:38.468
EVERY SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY SO

04:38:38.535 --> 04:38:41.204
WOMEN ARE NOW

04:38:41.271 --> 04:38:41.871
DISPROPORTIONATELY LEFT WITH NO

04:38:41.938 --> 04:38:42.906

PROVIDE CARE. WITH NO GUARANTEE

04:38:45.208 --> 04:38:47.444
OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN AND

04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:49.112
LEAVING THE JOB MARKET WE KNOW

04:38:49.179 --> 04:38:51.281
CAN HAVE LASTING IMPACT ON

04:38:51.347 --> 04:38:53.283
WOMEN'S CAREER TRAJECTORIES

04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:55.852
WAGERS. AND THOSE FURTHER

04:38:55.919 --> 04:38:58.154
FURTHERING THE GENDER WAGE GAP

04:38:58.221 --> 04:38:58.688
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ALL

04:38:58.755 --> 04:39:02.258
TRYING TO. REDUCE AND ELIMINATE.

04:39:02.325 --> 04:39:03.927
SO ALL OF THIS IS PLACING AN

04:39:03.993 --> 04:39:05.328
EXTRAORDINARY STRAIN ON WORKING

04:39:05.395 --> 04:39:06.796

UNPRECEDENTED JOB LOSS WE

04:39:12.969 --> 04:39:14.504
SHOULD NOT LET INADEQUATE LEAVE

04:39:14.571 --> 04:39:16.339
LAWS FORCE MORE PARENTS INTO A

04:39:16.406 --> 04:39:18.341
SITUATION WHERE THEY CANNOT

04:39:18.408 --> 04:39:20.043
KEEP THEIR JOBS BECAUSE THEY

04:39:20.110 --> 04:39:22.545
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CARING

04:39:22.612 --> 04:39:23.947
FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AND GOING

04:39:24.013 --> 04:39:25.882
TO WORK IT'S IN THIS CONTEXT

04:39:25.949 --> 04:39:27.517
THAT I BRING FORWARD THIS BILL

04:39:27.584 --> 04:39:30.220

THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS SO

04:55:26.775 --> 04:55:27.209
YOUR LIMINE TWENTY FIVE

04:55:27.276 --> 04:55:27.810
ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT. SINCE

04:55:27.876 --> 04:55:30.345
THE ONE. AND YOU KNOW MY FAMILY

04:55:30.412 --> 04:55:32.181
WERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS-

04:55:32.247 --> 04:55:35.551
WHAT- WE'VE AT ONE POINT I HAD

04:55:35.617 --> 04:55:37.319
A TIME WHERE WE HAD AN EMPLOYEE

04:55:37.386 --> 04:55:38.854
WHO WAS OUT FOR AN EXTENDED

04:55:38.921 --> 04:55:40.689
PERIOD TIME WHERE WE KEPT. THEM

04:55:40.756 --> 04:55:42.658
PLEASE JOB OPEN WHILE THEY WERE

04:55:42.724 --> 04:55:45.427
GONE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND

04:55:45.494 --> 04:55:47.996
VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT- IT'S

04:55:48.063 --> 04:55:50.566
NOT EASY BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS

04:55:50.632 --> 04:55:53.235
THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS OUT AND

04:55:53.302 --> 04:55:55.270
YOU HOLD YOUR JOB. THEN YOU

04:55:55.337 --> 04:55:57.206
CAN'T OFFER THE PERSON WHO'S

04:55:57.272 --> 04:55:58.474
GONNA BE FILLING IN FOR THEM

04:55:58.540 --> 04:56:00.409
ESPECIALLY THE SMALL BUSINESSES

04:56:00.476 --> 04:56:04.680
THE MORE CRITICAL EVERYBODY IS.

04:56:04.746 --> 04:56:05.247
TO BE ABLE TO SAY WELL I CAN

04:56:05.314 --> 04:56:05.814
GIVE A JOB BECAUSE WHEN THAT

04:56:05.881 --> 04:56:08.016
PERSON COMES BACK I CAN AFFORD

04:56:08.083 --> 04:56:09.351
TO OF THEM I CAN ONLY AFFORD

04:56:09.418 --> 04:56:10.385
ONE RIGHT SO THAT MEANS WHOEVER

04:56:10.452 --> 04:56:11.887
YOU BRING IN IS CERTAINLY NOT

04:56:11.954 --> 04:56:12.621

TO WORK AND THEY'LL DO WHAT

04:56:17.326 --> 04:56:18.894
THEY CAN BUT IT'S REALLY HARD

04:56:18.961 --> 04:56:20.062
TO TRAIN THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW

04:56:20.129 --> 04:56:21.964
THEY'RE NOT STAYING IT'S REALLY

04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:23.332
HARD TO RETAIN THEM BECAUSE AS

04:56:23.398 --> 04:56:24.433
SOON AS THEY HAVE A JOB THAT'S

04:56:24.500 --> 04:56:25.901
MORE PERMANENT THERE OFTEN GUY

04:56:25.968 --> 04:56:26.435
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND

04:56:26.502 --> 04:56:28.237
SOMEONE ELSE. FOR NOW THE EVEN

04:56:28.303 --> 04:56:29.838

RIGHT AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO

04:56:50.192 --> 04:56:51.293
FIGURE OUT HOW WE HELP THE

04:56:51.360 --> 04:56:53.862

SOME POINT FRANKLY. IF WE HAVE

04:58:49.978 --> 04:58:51.813
THIS UNIQUE SITUATION WHICH MAY

04:58:51.880 --> 04:58:54.182
NOT. BE UNIQUE GOING FORWARD

04:58:54.249 --> 04:58:56.184
DRAGGING A WE RECOGNIZE THERE

04:58:56.251 --> 04:58:58.520
ARE VIRUSES AND- WE HAD SARS

04:58:58.587 --> 04:59:00.188
AND WE HAD THE EACH ONE AND ONE

04:59:00.255 --> 04:59:01.890
AND WE WERE LUCKY THERE TO. TO

04:59:01.957 --> 04:59:03.759
CONTAIN THAT BUT THIS REALLY

04:59:03.825 --> 04:59:05.594
DEALS WITH THE SITUATION WHERE

04:59:05.661 --> 04:59:09.965
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED- AND PARENTS

04:59:10.032 --> 04:59:14.169
ARE CHEST ON ABLE- OR WE ARE

04:59:14.236 --> 04:59:15.637
FORCING THEM TO DECIDE THAT

04:59:15.704 --> 04:59:17.939
THEY GO TO WORK. OR DO THEY

04:59:18.006 --> 04:59:19.941
QUIT THEIR JOB AND STAY HOME

04:59:20.008 --> 04:59:21.243
WITH THEIR KIDS AND THEN IF

04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:23.178
THAT'S THE CASE. HOW TO THE

04:59:23.245 --> 04:59:24.579
GOOD GET BACK INTO THE

04:59:24.646 --> 04:59:27.749
WORKFORCE SO- CERTAINLY. HAPPY

04:59:27.816 --> 04:59:30.285
TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION- ON

04:59:30.352 --> 04:59:32.220
THE SIZE OF THIS BUT WHAT WE'RE

04:59:32.287 --> 04:59:33.922
REALLY LOOKING AT NOW WITH HIS

04:59:33.989 --> 04:59:36.425
IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE- AND

04:59:36.491 --> 04:59:38.393
THERE'S A PANDEMIC. AND YOU

04:59:38.460 --> 04:59:39.695
JUST HAPPENED TO BE UNLUCKY

04:59:39.761 --> 04:59:41.029
ENOUGH TO WORK FOR A SMALL

04:59:41.096 --> 04:59:47.602
EMPLOYER. THAT. AND SO- I MEAN

04:59:47.669 --> 04:59:49.137
THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WILL

04:59:49.204 --> 04:59:51.440
CONTINUE TO. TO HAVE GOING

04:59:51.506 --> 04:59:55.177
FORWARD- BUT IT DOES ADDRESS A-

04:59:55.243 --> 04:59:57.012
LARGE SALE PROBLEM AND NOT

04:59:57.079 --> 04:59:59.014
SORT OF- YOU KNOW I HAVE A

04:59:59.081 --> 05:00:00.882
STAFFER WHO. NEEDS OF

05:00:00.949 --> 05:00:02.718
ACCOMMODATIONS THIS IS SO FAR

05:00:02.784 --> 05:00:04.820
BEYOND AN ACCOMMODATION THIS IS

05:00:04.886 --> 05:00:06.755
A CRISIS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY

05:00:06.822 --> 05:00:08.457
SUCH WIDE IT CALLS FOR AN

05:00:08.523 --> 05:00:10.225
EMERGENCY. AND OF COURSE WE CAN

05:00:10.292 --> 05:00:12.227
WORK ON- WE'RE NOT TALKING

05:00:12.294 --> 05:00:13.628
ABOUT AN EIGHT YEAR EMERGENCY

05:00:13.695 --> 05:00:14.696
WE'RE TALKING BUT WHAT HAPPENS

05:00:14.763 --> 05:00:16.598
ESSENTIALLY WHEN OUR SOCIAL

05:00:16.665 --> 05:00:19.534
SAFETY NETWORK COLLAPSES. AND

05:00:19.601 --> 05:00:20.102
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

05:00:20.168 --> 05:00:22.104
HERE. I GUESS SAID NO IT

05:00:22.170 --> 05:00:23.572
CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW

05:00:23.638 --> 05:00:25.340
THOSE DISCUSSIONS GO I THINK IT

05:00:25.407 --> 05:00:26.441
I THINK IT WAS REFERENCE THAT

05:00:26.508 --> 05:00:28.043
THE DECLARATION WRITTEN AND I

05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:29.144
REALIZED WHAT TRIGGERS THIS

05:00:29.211 --> 05:00:30.712
BILL IS ACTUALLY THE SCHOOLS

05:00:30.779 --> 05:00:31.680
BEING CLOSED SO IT'S NOT JUST A

05:00:31.747 --> 05:00:33.582
STATE OF EMERGENCY SO I REALIZE

05:00:33.648 --> 05:00:34.783
SOME IS THE EMERGING LAST A

05:00:34.850 --> 05:00:37.919
LONG TIME. SCHOOLS GENERAL TRY

05:00:37.986 --> 05:00:38.453
TO GET BACK OPEN WHEN THEY

05:00:38.520 --> 05:00:39.821
CAN'T. AT THE SAME TIME-

05:00:39.888 --> 05:00:40.922
DEPENDING AGAIN ON THE NATURE

05:00:40.989 --> 05:00:42.190
OF THE BUSINESS IF THEY'RE

05:00:42.257 --> 05:00:45.260
DOING. LIKE VITAL SAYING THIS-

05:00:45.327 --> 05:00:48.397
IT CETERA I MEAN I AM. I JUST

05:00:48.463 --> 05:00:50.065
THINK THAT THERE IS- HAVING

05:00:50.132 --> 05:00:51.466
SEEN WHAT'S LIKE ON THE OTHER

05:00:51.533 --> 05:00:53.568
SIDE TOO I MEAN I'VE SEEN WHAT

05:00:53.635 --> 05:00:56.004
BOTH SIDES- TRY TRYING TO

05:00:56.071 --> 05:00:57.139
FIGURE OUT HOW WE STRIKE THE

05:00:57.205 --> 05:00:59.775
RIGHT BALANCE- BECAUSE IT SAID

05:00:59.841 --> 05:01:01.777
IN THE END THE PERSON'S. JOB

05:01:01.843 --> 05:01:02.878
MILLER SAYING WITHOUT PROMISE

05:01:02.944 --> 05:01:04.346
SOMEONE THERE TO HAVE A JOB TO

05:01:04.413 --> 05:01:06.481
COME BACK TO. WE DON'T KNOW A

05:01:06.548 --> 05:01:07.015
WHOLE LOT YOU KNOW THAT

05:01:07.082 --> 05:01:08.850
OBVIOUSLY THIS ASKED WE DON'T

05:01:08.917 --> 05:01:09.418
KNOW HOW LONG SUMMER LONGER

05:01:09.484 --> 05:01:11.553
SHORTER. THAN THE PROBLEM IS

05:01:11.620 --> 05:01:14.156
THAT- THE BUSINESS OWNER MAY

05:01:14.222 --> 05:01:15.991
END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE IT

05:01:16.057 --> 05:01:18.693
IS LIKE OKAY WELL NOT ONLY DO

05:01:18.760 --> 05:01:20.162
YOU KNOW OKAY I CAN'T KEEP YOUR

05:01:20.228 --> 05:01:21.363
JOB OPENED BUT THE ONLY WAY I

05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:22.998
CAN. DEAL WITH THIS IS ACTUALLY

05:01:23.064 --> 05:01:23.932
JUST SHUT DOWN MY TIRE BUSINESS

05:01:23.999 --> 05:01:25.634
AND EVERYONE IS THEIR JOB NOW

05:01:25.700 --> 05:01:26.868
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BIG YOU

05:01:26.935 --> 05:01:29.271
KNOW. COMPANY BUT BASICALLY IS

05:01:29.337 --> 05:01:30.539
BUT BASS TO THE ACT I JUST

05:01:30.605 --> 05:01:32.340
CAN'T MAKE IT WORK ANYMORE AND

05:01:32.407 --> 05:01:34.643
I THINK THAT- BECAUSE I HAVE TO

05:01:34.709 --> 05:01:35.844
YOU KNOW EITHER I VIOLATE THE

05:01:35.911 --> 05:01:37.279

TO. THE PERSON WHO FILLS IN THE

05:01:41.550 --> 05:01:43.452
HOLE AND I THINK THAT'S THE

05:01:43.518 --> 05:01:44.486
CHALLENGE OF LOOKING AT LEAST

05:01:44.553 --> 05:01:45.654

05:01:45.720 --> 05:01:49.424

THE SUPREME COURT WILL ON A-

05:09:23.778 --> 05:09:25.513
ACTUALLY WHETHER THE- AGREEMENT

05:09:25.580 --> 05:09:27.582
WAS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND FOUND

05:09:27.649 --> 05:09:29.083
THAT IT WAS A GRADUAL BECAUSE

05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.951
IT WOULD'VE FORCED THE WORKER

INTO A FORM THAT WOULD BE

05:09:31.486 --> 05:09:33.488
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE

05:09:33.554 --> 05:09:35.156
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. WELL IT

05:09:35.223 --> 05:09:37.191
WAS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN FROM

05:09:37.258 --> 05:09:38.359
THE GREEN HOW ABOUT THE WORKER

05:09:38.426 --> 05:09:39.460
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FILE A

CLAIM IN ARBITRATION. AND IT

05:09:41.296 --> 05:09:42.430
WOULD REQUIRE THE WORKER TO

05:09:42.497 --> 05:09:43.798
RESPOND THE FORMAL DISCOVERY

05:09:43.865 --> 05:09:45.800

COMPILED ARBITRATION BY THE

05:10:08.957 --> 05:10:10.224

CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AND IT

05:10:24.806 --> 05:10:26.174

ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT WE

05:33:03.697 --> 05:33:05.131
STANDARDS FOR EVIDENCE IS

05:33:05.198 --> 05:33:06.666
IMPROPER AND PROBABLY VIOLATES

05:33:06.733 --> 05:33:08.068
DUE PROCESS WE DON'T THINK IT

05:33:08.134 --> 05:33:09.436
SHOULD BE IN THIS BILL. AGAIN

05:33:09.502 --> 05:33:10.136
WE DON'T HAVE A FULL

05:33:10.203 --> 05:33:12.038
OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH THAT OUT

05:33:12.105 --> 05:33:12.872
BECAUSE THIS BILL ISN'T GOING

05:33:12.939 --> 05:33:14.574
TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SO

05:33:14.641 --> 05:33:15.742
AGAIN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

05:33:15.809 --> 05:33:17.677

05:33:22.515 --> 05:33:23.717
MAKES IT VERY SIGNIFICANT

05:33:23.783 --> 05:33:26.019
CHANGES TO THE LAW. WE THINK

05:33:26.086 --> 05:33:27.220
THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SPEND

05:33:27.287 --> 05:33:29.356
THE TIME TO GET IT RIGHT- YOU

05:33:29.422 --> 05:33:30.457
