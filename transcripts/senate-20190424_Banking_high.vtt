ESTABLISHING -- NEW BANKS -- IN

TODAY'S WORLD WE WE GENERALLY

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:10.022

AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ON THESE

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.243
ENTITIES I MEAN THE BAND BOARD

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.745
MEMBERS PRESIDENTS A CHAIRMAN OF

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:36.682

KNOWLEDGE OF NONPROFIT ENTITIES --

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.387
THE I HAVE A HAT WORKED WITH

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.190
PRESIDENTS -- THREE MAJOR BANKS

00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:48.660
IN TURNING AROUND BANKS -- WE WE

00:18:48.727 --> 00:18:50.496
HAD ONE BANK THAT -- IS A BIT

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:51.997
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BANK THAT

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.765
HAD A LOSS OF OVER ELEVEN

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.668
MILLION WE CONVERTED THAT BANK.

00:18:56.735 --> 00:18:58.804
TO NOMINAL PROFIT AND WE SOLD

00:18:58.871 --> 00:18:59.505
THE BANK.

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:01.540
SO WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.809
HOW BANKS OPERATE HOW WHAT IT

00:19:03.876 --> 00:19:07.546
TAKES TO MAKE THEM BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.515
AW I'VE.

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:12.017
LATCHED ON AT THE END I USE THAT

00:19:12.084 --> 00:19:15.254
LOOSELY -- TO THE THE THOUGHT OF

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.421
CONVERTING THE ALLIED BANK

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:18.524
BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.158
ALREADY THERE -- IS NOT

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.493
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO START FROM

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.729
SCRATCH AS I SAID MOST BANKERS

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:26.265
NOW LOOKING TO ACQUIRE EXISTING

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:26.999
BANKS.

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:28.734
BECAUSE IT IS JUST CHEAPER AND

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.069
IF IT WORKS A LOT EASIER FOR

00:19:31.136 --> 00:19:34.473
THEM -- THE I'D MAKE KIDS OVER

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.440
FIFTEEN YEARS TO MY KNOWLEDGE

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:36.975
NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF OF

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.645
OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY AND

00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:43.248
LENDING -- TO PRIMARILY

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:44.650
MUNICIPALITIES FOR

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.784
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:49.221
IMPROVEMENT -- I I DO AGREE THAT --

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:51.323
A BASE ON MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.258
IT WILL BE IN THE BILLIONS OF

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:54.726
DOLLARS THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:57.062
OF DOLLARS TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:59.031
BE DONE -- FOR THE STATE OF

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:00.832
CALIFORNIA TO BRING OUR

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.367
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:03.835
UP TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND TO

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.138
ADD TO WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:09.508
STATE -- ONE OF THE REASONS I

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.443
LIKE THE I BANK IS BECAUSE IF

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.712
YOU LOOK IF WE WERE ABLE TO JUST

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:14.913
SAVE.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.882
A QUARTER OF A PERCENT LESS IF

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.183
IN EIGHTH OF A PERCENT.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.888
OF BRANHAM ON NOT ALONE -- THAT

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:25.958
SAVES US OVER A MILLION DOLLARS --

00:20:26.024 --> 00:20:27.759
AND YOU MULTIPLY THAT OVER A

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.027
TWENTY YEAR LOAN THAT'S A

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:31.363
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS -- I BELIEVE

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.566
THAT -- THAT CAN BE DONE -- THE

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.201
PRESENT STATE OF THE I. BANK IS

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:37.669
THAT IT BORROWS MONEY THROUGH

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.905
BONDS AND SO FORTH TO SUPPORT

00:20:39.972 --> 00:20:42.207
ITS ACTIVITIES -- IT HAS A

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:44.009
RESTRICTED RESTRICTION ON ITS

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.678
CAPITAL -- JUST EXAMINING THE

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:48.680
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.882
THE PREVIOUS YEAR IT COULD HAVE

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:53.952
DOUBLED WHAT -- IT MADE -- IF

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:56.121
THE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT THERE --

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:58.323
AND THEREFORE I I BELIEVE THAT

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.759
IF THE STATE CAPITALIZE THE THE

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:05.364
THE I BANK PROPERLY -- IT CAN IT

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.699
CAN NOT ONLY DO WELL IT CAN DO

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.601
VERY WELL OVER A RELATIVELY

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.770
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- THE

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.372
BIGGEST HICK UP WITH WITH DOING

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.507
A COMMERCIAL BANK OF CONVERTING

00:21:15.574 --> 00:21:16.808
THE I. BANK TO A COMMERCIAL BANK

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.344
IS THE LACK OF THE POSITIVE

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:23.949
SUPPORT -- THE NEED FOR FUNDS.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:25.817
I BELIEVE THAT CAN BE DONE -- I

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:27.853
I HAVE A SCENE THE LETTER FROM

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:30.722
THERE SEE I YOU -- DAVE ALSO

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.824
ATTENDED MEETINGS THAT I HAVE.

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.093
BEEN A PART OF WHERE THEY'VE

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.329
EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT OF A

00:21:37.396 --> 00:21:39.965
PUBLIC BANK I'VE ALSO HAD OTHER

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.334
UNIONS -- MAJOR UNIONS

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.369
PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THE FORMS

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:46.038
THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF AND

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:49.408
THEY ALSO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.942
PUBLIC BANK.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.944
OF FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT IT

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.880
NOT ONLY THE THE NUMBER I GAVE

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:56.848
YOU AN EIGHTH OF A POINT TO IT

00:21:56.915 --> 00:21:59.918
WHICH IS JUST A GAS -- KNOWING

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.889
HOW BANKS OPERATE IT CAN BE MORE --

00:22:03.955 --> 00:22:06.758
THEY ALSO SEE THE FEES SINCE AND

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:08.927
CHARGES THAT COME FROM DEALING

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:12.698
WITH YOUR NORMAL COMMERCIAL BANK.

00:22:12.764 --> 00:22:13.765
THOSE FEES AND CHARGES -- COULD

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:16.601
BE ELIMINATED ALL GO TOWARDS --

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:19.037
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE

00:22:19.104 --> 00:22:21.273
IDEA IS NOT TO HAVE A NON PROFIT

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:23.642
IT WILL BE A FOR PROFIT BANK THE

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.210
MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS.

00:22:25.277 --> 00:22:26.578
THE PROFIT COMES AT THE STATE OF

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:30.649
CALIFORNIA -- AND THE FIGHT THAT

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:33.652
BANKS ARE -- OBVIOUSLY BEING A

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.187
SUCCESSFUL.

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:37.389
WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE ALLIED

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:41.393
BANK -- CAN ALSO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.394
ARMED.

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.936
VERY AMBITIOUS BUT I'M SURE

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:40.205
DOABLE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.340
DO HOW WE CAN INVEST OUR OWN TAX

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:43.875

BECAUSE WE AGREE THAT THE

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:58.390
CONCEPT IS GREAT BUT IN THE

00:25:58.456 --> 00:25:59.791
DETAILS OF HOW DO WE MAKE IT

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:00.592
WORK.

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:02.327

TAKE SHAPE THE STUDY COMES BACK

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:21.012
IT SAYS A YOU CAN GO FROM THE

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.714
