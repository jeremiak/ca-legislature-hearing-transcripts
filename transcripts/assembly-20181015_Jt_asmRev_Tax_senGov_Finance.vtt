00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.989
HIGH LEVEL INTRODUCTION WITH THE

UNDERSTANDING THAT SUBSEQUENT

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.593
SPEAKERS WILL GO INTO GREATER

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.094
DEPTH IN THEIR AREAS OF

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.095
EXPERTISE.

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:40.164
SAW START ON PAGE ONE OF THE

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.732
HAND -- WITH

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:43.300
A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF

00:41:43.367 --> 00:41:46.103
CALIFORNIA SALES AND USE TAX.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.738
THIS IS A TAX THAT MANY PEOPLE

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:50.174
KNOW SIMPLY AS SALES TAX BUT

00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.476
IT'S ACTUALLY TAX WITH.

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:53.911
TWO COMPLEMENTARY PIECES THE

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:58.582
FIRST ON GOOD SOLD BY RETAILERS

00:41:58.649 --> 00:41:59.917
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.719
AND THE SECOND PART IS A USE TAX

00:42:01.785 --> 00:42:03.687
ON GOODS PURCHASED FROM OTHER

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.889
RETAILERS.

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.790
IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:08.292
FISCAL YEAR TAXPAYERS PAID A

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:10.294
TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE BILLION

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:12.763
DOLLARS IN SALES AND USE TAX AND

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.098
ALL OF THAT FIFTY THREE BILLION

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.599
TOTAL.

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.902
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION WENT

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.870
TO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND --

00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:21.705
WITH WHICH MAKES THE SALES AND

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.073
USE TAX THE SECOND BIGGEST

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.009
GENERAL FUND REVENUE SOURCE

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:27.878
AFTER THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX.

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.380
THE REMAINING SALES AND USE TAX

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:31.448
REVENUE GOES TO A VARIETY OF

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:32.850
FUNDS THAT SUPPORT LOCAL

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:35.219
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.654
THE SALES AND USE TAX RATE

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.123
VARIES QUITE A BIT ACROSS CITIES

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.858
AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA JUST

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:43.694
AS IT DOES IN MOST OTHER STATES.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.696
DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION --

00:42:45.763 --> 00:42:48.766
TAXABLE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.434
TO ONE OF ABOUT TWO DOZEN

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:51.702
DISTINCT RATES.

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.237
THE LOWEST RATE IS SEVEN AND A

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:54.905
QUARTER PERCENT AND THE HIGHEST

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:56.307
RATE IS TEN AND A QUARTER

00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:58.776
PERCENT WITH AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:00.244
EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT.

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.312
THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:03.180
RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.748
THE SALES AND USE TAX IS THE

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:07.017
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:10.220
FEE ADMINISTRATION OR CD TFA.

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:11.855
CITY TFA IS A NEW DEPARTMENT

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.757
CREATED BY A LAW PASSED LAST

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:14.959
YEAR -- THIS

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.593
DEPARTMENT INHERITED MOST OF THE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.628
TAX ADMINISTRATION

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:19.563
RESPONSIBILITIES FORMERLY

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.398
ASSIGNED TO THE STATE BOARD OF

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.900
EQUALIZATION.

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.902
SO NOW TURNING TO THE SECOND

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:30.274
PAGE OF THE HANDOUT.

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:31.475
ALL THE OF A LITTLE BIT DEEPER

00:43:31.542 --> 00:43:32.843
INTO A POINT THAT I KIND OF

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.144
GLOSSED OVER RIGHT AT THE

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.045
BEGINNING --

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:37.014
WHEN CALIFORNIANS BUY GOODS FROM

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.682
STORES ARE OTHER RETAILERS

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:41.151
LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA?

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:43.153
THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.522
TO SALES TAX BUT THERE ARE LOTS

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:48.258
OF INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:49.793
LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.563
MAKE VERY SIMILAR PURCHASES

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:55.499
STATE OR REMOTE SELLERS IN THOSE

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.634
TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY ARE

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.436
SUBJECT TO USE TAX SYSTEM

00:43:59.503 --> 00:44:02.740
EXAMPLES OF USE TAX LIABILITY

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:04.074
INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.976
OF WHAT THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.111
HEARING IS IT IS AS I UNDERSTAND

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:09.279
IT BUYING ITEMS ONLINE FROM

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.248
RETAILERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.182
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.984
THERE'S SOME OTHER EXAMPLES FOR

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:14.818
EXAMPLE --

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:16.887
WHEN CALIFORNIANS TRAVEL OUTSIDE

00:44:16.954 --> 00:44:19.189
OF THE STATE BY TAXABLE GOODS

00:44:19.256 --> 00:44:20.657
AND BRING THEM BACK IN THE

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:23.494
CALIFORNIA TO USE THAT ALSO IS --

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.062
IS AN EVENT THAT TRIGGERS USE

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:27.197
TAX LIABILITY AND THEN THERE'S A

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.866
THIRD EXAMPLE OF USE TAX THAT

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:30.634
DOESN'T COME TO MIND TOO OFTEN

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:33.971
BUT THAT'S NGUYEN INDIVIDUAL

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:37.007
SELL USED CARS TO ONE ANOTHER --

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:38.175
THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.810
GEOGRAPHIC ISSUE THEY'RE BOTH

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:42.046
PARTIES COULD BE LOCATED RIGHT

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:44.114
HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT PEOPLE

00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:45.849
WHO SELL THINGS ONLY ON RARE

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:48.318
OCCASIONS OFTEN DON'T NEED TO

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:50.487
REGISTER AS SELLERS TO PAY SALES

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.523
TAX ON THE NOSE AND INSTANCES.

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.525
WHOEVER IS PURCHASING THAT USED

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:56.827
CAR WILL OF USE TAX.

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:57.995
SO GOING BACK TO THOSE FIRST TWO

00:44:58.062 --> 00:45:01.098
EXAMPLES WHERE THERE'S A

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.533
PURCHASE FROM OUT OF STATE.

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:03.500
ARE THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.235
GETTING CONSUMERS TO PAY THE TAX

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.737
THAT THEY OWE.

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.705
ON THEIR PURCHASES ARE PROBABLY

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.707
READILY APPARENT TO YOU SO A

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:13.343
COMMON STRATEGY THAT STATES USE

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.345
TO INCREASE USE TAX COMPLIANCE

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:17.047
IS TO FIND WAYS TO COLLECT THAT

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:19.116
TAX FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:21.018
SELLING THE TAXABLE GOODS RATHER

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:21.552
THAN.

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:23.153
FROM THE CONSUMERS THAT ARE

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:23.754
BUYING THEM.

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.389
SO THEN THE LEGAL QUESTION THAT

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.925
COMES UP THERE IS HOW CAN STATES

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.593
DO THAT WITHOUT BURDENING

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.062
INTERSTATE COMMERCE. TO A DEGREE

00:45:32.129 --> 00:45:34.431
THAT VIOLATES THE IT'S

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:37.434
CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S BROADLY

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.036
SPEAKING WHAT THE WAY FOR

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.405
DECISION WAS ALL ABOUT.

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:42.773
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.775
LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK BACK AT

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.076
WHAT WHAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO WAY

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.212
FAIR SO ON PAGE THREE OF THE

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:50.581
HANDOUT.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.649
WE HIGHLIGHT TWO CENTRAL

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:54.885
CONCEPTS IN COMMERCE CLAUSE

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.187
JURISPRUDENCE WITH REGARD TO

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.322
STATE TAXES --

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.424
SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS AND PHYSICAL

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:03.627
PRESENCE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS IS

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:07.531
ONE PART OF FOUR PART TEST USED.

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:08.899
TO DETERMINE OVER THE LAST

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.868
SEVERAL DECADES WHETHER A STATE

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.804
TAX UNDULY BURDENS INTERSTATE

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:15.339
COMMERCE AND FOR THIS AND FOR

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:17.508
THE TAX TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL.

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:20.310
THE TAXED ACTIVITY MUST HAVE.

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:22.212
A SO CALLED SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.381
WITH THE TAXING STATE ALL

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:25.149
DEFERRED OTHERS SPEAKERS ON

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:27.951
THERE INVOLVING PRECISE LEGAL

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:30.154
MEANING OF THAT TERM --

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.089
THE SECOND KEY CONCEPTS. FOR

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.824
UNDERSTANDING WAY FAIR IS

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:36.426
PHYSICAL PRESENCE SO BACK IN

00:46:36.493 --> 00:46:36.960
NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN THE

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.195
LANDMARK WILL DECISION FOR

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:41.064
EXAMPLE THE SUPREME COURT RULED.

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:42.733
THAT A STATE COULD NOT TAX

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:45.636
BUSINESSES THAT HAD NO PHYSICAL

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.137
PRESENCE WITHIN THAT STATE.

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:48.939
SO BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.807
OPERATING WITHIN THAT PHYSICAL

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.476
PRESENCE FRAMEWORK OF THE

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.411
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED A

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.848
LAW AB ONE FIFTY FIVE OF TWENTY

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.349
ELEVEN THAT EXPANDED THE SET OF

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:00.884
BUSINESSES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:01.451
COLLECT.

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:03.420
USE TAX ON BEHALF OF THEIR

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.890
CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR AB ONE

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:07.691
FIFTY FIVE EXTENDED THIS

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.660
REQUIREMENT TO TWO TYPES OF

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:11.328
BUSINESSES.

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.462
OTHER FIRST TYPE WERE REMOTE

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.966
SELLERS THAT A SPEAKING PART OF

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:16.934
THE SAME --

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.702
CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AS

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:21.438
IN STATE BUSINESSES AND THEN THE

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:22.105
SECOND --

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:24.575
TYPE WAS REMOTE SELLERS WHO WORK

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:27.010
WITH AFFILIATES THAT ARE LOCATED

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:28.745
WITHIN THE STATE PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.747
FOR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO THOSE

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.349
REMOTE SELLERS.

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:35.886
SO THEN PAGE FOUR OF THE HANDOUT.

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.354
DISPLAYS.

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.056
THE REVENUE COLLECTED FROM

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:41.959
BUSINESSES REGISTERED UNDER AB

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.727
ONE ONE FIFTY FIVE AS A SHARE.

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.929
OF TOTAL SALES AND USE TAX

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.130
REVENUE.

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:48.865
AND SO THE GRAPH.

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.400
FAIRLY SIMPLE ONE BUT IT

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.635
ILLUSTRATES A COUPLE THINGS

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:55.172
WORTH NOTING OFF FIRST ALTHOUGH

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.107
AB ONE FIFTY FIVE REVENUE IS BY

00:47:57.174 --> 00:47:58.442
NO MEANS TRIVIAL IT'S A

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:01.078
RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE AT THIS

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.746
TIME OF OVERALL SALES AND USE

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:03.480
TAX.

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:05.182
THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD DISPLAYED

00:48:05.249 --> 00:48:06.650
IT'S LESS THAN ONE AND A HALF

00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:07.718
PERCENT.

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:10.053
OF THE SECOND THING IS THAT AB

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.421
ONE FIFTY FIVE REVENUE.

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:13.056
HAS BEEN GROWING AT A FASTER

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.925
RATE THAN OTHER SALES AND USE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.660
TAX REVENUE AND AS SUCH IT

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.662
REPRESENTS THOUGH A SMALL

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.831
CERTAINLY AN INCREASING SHARE OF

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:22.666
THE TOTAL OVER TIME.

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:23.967
AND TURNING TO THE FIFTH AND

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.702
FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT.

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:27.571
WE HAVE A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY OF

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.772
THE WAY FOR DECISION THAT I

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:30.374
BELIEVE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.708
GREATER DETAIL BY OTHERS

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:32.843
SPEAKERS.

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.878
ARE SUGGEST IS VERY BRIEF

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:37.314
BACKGROUND A COUPLE YEARS AGO

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:38.749
SOUTH DAKOTA PASSED A LAW.

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.917
REQUIRING REMOTE SELLERS TO PAY

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:43.620
TAXES IF THEY EXCEED EITHER OF

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:45.889
TWO ANNUAL THRESHOLDS A HUNDRED

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:46.723
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF GROSS

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.859
REVENUE FROM SALES INTO SOUTH

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:49.493
DAKOTA.

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.762
OR TWO HUNDRED OR MORE SEPARATE

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:53.664
SALES TRANSACTIONS INTO THE

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.532
STATE --

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.267
SOME REMOTE SELLERS REFUSED TO

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.369
COMPLY WITH THE NEW LAW SIR

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:00.871
SOUTH DAKOTA TOOK THEM TO COURT.

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:02.472
AND THE LOWER COURTS RULED IN

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.408
FAVOR OF THE REMOTE SELLERS DUE

00:49:04.474 --> 00:49:06.777
TO THEIR LACK OF PHYSICAL

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:08.412
PRESENCE WITHIN SOUTH DAKOTA.

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.914
THEN THE US SUPREME COURT

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.349
DECISION --

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:14.117
GOT RID OF THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:16.119
REQUIREMENT AND VACATED THE

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:17.654
LOWER COURT RULINGS.

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.823
AND THEN ABSENT THAT PHYSICAL

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.992
PRESENCE REQUIREMENT THE SUPREME

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.694
COURT RULED THAT THE SOUTH

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.961
DAKOTA LINE DOES MEET THE

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:26.763
SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS REQUIREMENT

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.066
AND DOES NOT UNDULY BURDEN

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.834
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:32.202
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT.

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.070
WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE LEGAL

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:37.207
SUBSTANCES DETAIL US THAT

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:40.344
CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND AT

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.446
THIS TIME I'D BE HAPPY.

00:49:42.512 --> 00:49:43.046
TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:48.085

WE KNEW CENTER MARKET HAVE A FEW

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:58.562
QUESTIONS.

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.263
I THINK YES DON'T.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:00.931
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MOST OF OUR

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.199
SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS FOR THAT

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:03.066
FOR THE NEXT BIGGER WHEN WE TALK

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:03.800
ABOUT SOME OF THE LEGAL

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:04.735
BACKGROUND OF THE DECISION AND

00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:07.204
SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS BUT

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.771
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:18.648

AND STAFF OF THANK YOU THE

00:50:53.383 --> 00:50:53.884
OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.584
IMPORTANT CASE.

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.853
A IT IS A A MAJOR LANDMARK CASE

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.456
HERE AND YOU'VE GOT A LINE OF MY

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:00.724
REMARKS HERE.

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:03.193
BASICALLY THIS WAY FAIR CASE IS

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.828
LISTEN AFRICAN CASE IN THAT THE

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.764
COURT DID OVERTURN FIFTY ONE

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.166
YEARS OF PRIOR PRESIDENT WHICH

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.001
IS NOT A COMMON THING FOR THE

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.235
SUPREME COURT TO DO.

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:13.837
A BASICALLY SAYING THE PHYSICAL

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.705
PRESENCE RULE OF QUILL WHICH

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:18.508
DATED BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.744
TWO IS UNSOUND AND IN CORRECT

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.946
THAT'S A A MAJOR HAD HIT TO THAT

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:23.713
THAT CASE.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.148
OF THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:51:25.215 --> 00:51:25.982
STANDARD SHOULD NOT BE THE

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:26.750
STANDARD FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.618
NEXUS FIRST PART OF THE FOUR

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.053
PART TEST OF COMPLETE AUTO

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:30.987
TRANSIT.

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:31.922
THEY WERE JUST LOOKING AT THIS

00:51:31.988 --> 00:51:33.356
COMPLETE AUTO TRANSIT CASING

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:35.025
PHYSICAL PRESENCE BASICALLY WAS

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:37.727
JUST TOO LIMITING OF A STANDARD

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:38.829
AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT OF

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:39.863
HIGH MENTION AGAIN AS I GO

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.331
THROUGH MY REMARKS THAT.

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:42.532
WHILE WE MIGHT THINK WAS IT

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.167
ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.602
BECAUSE THE COURT TO ADVANCE TO

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:47.404
THIS POINT IT REALLY WASN'T THEY

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:49.439
WERE SAYING EVEN BACK IN

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:50.340
NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN QUILL

00:51:50.407 --> 00:51:51.208
WHEN THEY DECIDED PHYSICAL

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.342
PRESENCE THERE PROBABLY WERE

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:54.144
JUST BEING TOO NARROW AT THAT

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:54.978
POINT -- AS

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:56.279
WELL SO FAR AS WHAT COULD

00:51:56.346 --> 00:52:01.518
POSSIBLY BE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS.

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:02.452
SOUTH DAKOTA SALES TAX

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:03.453
COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS --

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.287
THAT THEY FOUND PROTECTS

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.823
INTERSTATE COMMERCE FISHING

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:09.159
NEXUS BASED ON BOTH ECONOMIC AND

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.861
VIRTUAL CONTACT.

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:11.862
THAT THE SELLERS HAVE WITH THE

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.663
STATE AND THEY DO HIGHLIGHT

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.699
THREE FEATURES OF THE SOUTH

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:16.433
DAKOTA LAW ACROSS THE SOUTH

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.268
DAKOTA LAW WAS PURPOSELY ENACTED

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.903
THE TRYING TO GET A CASE TO THE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:20.971
SUPREME COURT.

00:52:21.037 --> 00:52:22.739
THE CHALLENGE THE QUILL CASE

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:24.341
BECAUSE AN EARLIER DECISION

00:52:24.407 --> 00:52:26.009
JUSTICE KENNEDY HAD HINTED THAT

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.277
IT WAS TIME TO OVERTURN QUILTS

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.512
THE SEVERAL STATES ARE VERY

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.447
EAGER TO GET THEIR CASE THERE.

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:31.948
AND SOUTH DAKOTA LAW HAD IT A

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:34.050
SYSTEM WHERE IT COULD GET THAT

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:35.252
MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.786
OF THESE THREE FEATURES I WILL

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.955
COME BACK TO THIS WAS --

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:40.590
THERE WAS A SAFE HARBOR FOR

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.058
LIMITED BUSINESS ACTIVITY.

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:43.426
THERE WAS NO RETRO.

00:52:43.493 --> 00:52:45.695
APPLICATION OF SOUTH DAKOTA IS

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:48.431
CHANGING ITS SALES TAX STANDARD

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.166
AND THERE WAS A SYSTEM IN SOUTH

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:52.235
DAKOTA TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.837
AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.772
SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THE

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.240
SUPREME COURT DID NOT SAY WELL

00:52:57.307 --> 00:52:59.309
HERE IS THE STANDARD IT JUST

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.310
SAID THAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.245
STANDARD WAS WITHIN THOSE

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.914
GUIDELINES --

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.215
JUST ONE INTERESTING POINT --

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.550
IF INSTEAD OF LIKE A HUNDRED

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:07.183
THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD HAVE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.151
BEEN A FIFTY THOUSAND OUR

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:08.718
THRESHOLD THAT HAVE MADE A

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.387
DIFFERENCE WE DON'T REALLY

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:13.323
DOUBTS ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS --

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.890
WHICH AND WAS WHILE YOU'RE

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.125
HOLDING THIS HEARING AS TO WHAT

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:17.360
THIS CASE ARE REALLY MEANS.

00:53:17.427 --> 00:53:19.796
I DO WANT TO STRESS BUT I HAVE A

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:23.967
UNFORTUNATE TYPO HIM THE FIRST

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.670
PAGE OF MY OUTLINED ALL REMOTE

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.138
SELLERS CAN BE SUBJECT TO A

00:53:28.204 --> 00:53:29.139
STATE'S TAXES.

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:30.373
A WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.541
EVERY SELLER --

00:53:31.608 --> 00:53:32.609
WHO DOESN'T HAVE A PHYSICAL

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:33.944
PRESENCE TO COLLECT TAX WE DON'T

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.912
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE STANDARD

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.013
IS -- BUT

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.882
SOLELY THEY'D MADE IT CLEAR THAT

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.317
SOME LIMITED BUSINESS ACTIVITY

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.651
WOULD EXCUSE SOMEBODY FROM

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:44.387
HAVING TO PAY --

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:46.056
TO COLLECT SALES TAX THAT IT'D

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:47.691
BE BANNED THE CASE ACTUALLY BACK

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:48.725
TO THE SOUTH DAKOTA SUPREME

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:51.428
COURT SO THEY COULD DâN RULE

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:53.196
BASED ON THE NEW STANDARD THAT

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:54.864
THE SUPREME COURTHAD HAD LAID

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:56.533
OUT SO WE WE ARE WAITING HERE

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.567
WHAT HAPPENS THERE.

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:58.401
THIS REALLY IS A VERY

00:53:58.468 --> 00:53:59.803
SIGNIFICANT DECISION AS I NOTED

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.738
OVERTURNED FIFTY ONE YEARS OF

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.540
STATE TAX PRESIDENT OF THAT

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.241
INCLUDED THE UP TO THE QUILL

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.476
CASE FROM.

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:07.043
NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND THE

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:08.144
WHOLE CASE WAS A MAJOR CASE

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:09.679
BECAUSE IT HAD CLARIFIED AND

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.414
WENT A STEP BEYOND WHAT THE

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:12.549
BELLAS HAS CASE.

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:14.417
HAD ALLOWED A FEW DECADES

00:54:14.484 --> 00:54:15.385
EARLIER.

00:54:15.452 --> 00:54:16.953
IN THE BELLAS HAS CASE THEY

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.521
PRETTY MUCH SAID FOR BOTH DUE

00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:20.190
PROCESS IAN COMMERCE CLAUSE

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:22.158
PURPOSES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:23.960
PHYSICAL PRESENCE.

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:25.428
AND IN THAT BILLS HAS CASE THEY

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:27.998
WERE STRESSING THAT YOU KNOW

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.265
THERE WOULD BE SOME BURDEN ON

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:30.233
THE GO SMALL VENDORS THAT THEY

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.968
HAD TO COULD BE COLLECTING TAX

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:32.869
BECAUSE EVEN ENVELOPES HAS

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.504
DECADES AGO THEY NOTED.

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.972
THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:37.507
JURISDICTIONS IN THE U. S. B.

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:38.775
THE COUNT THE STATE'S IN THE

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:40.677
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.278
ASSESS SALES TAX.

00:54:42.345 --> 00:54:43.780
SO WHEN.

00:54:43.847 --> 00:54:47.484
CIVIL DECADES GO ON AND THE

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:49.686
COURTS AS PERHAPS WRONG WE CAN

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:52.522
SEE FOR ALL THIS GROWTH AND

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:56.893
SALES THAT'S WHAT THE QUILL AND

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.528
TO GET TO THE COURT IN A QUILL

00:54:58.595 --> 00:54:59.963
FOR EXAMPLE WAS.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.465
THE SIXTH LARGEST OFFICE SUPPLY

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.534
SELLER IN NORTH DAKOTA BUT HAD

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:05.835
NO PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT THEY

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.404
WOULD JUST MAIL CATALOGS THERE

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.138
AND THEY WOULD GET A LOT OF

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.272
BUSINESS OF THE STATE'S THEY

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.340
WERE CONCERNED.

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:11.841
AND IT WAS TIME TO LOOK AT

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.109
BALLOTS HAS AGAIN BUT WHEN THE

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:14.944
SUPREME COURT NINETEEN YOU TO

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:16.212
LOOK AT THE QUILL DECISION.

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:18.048
THEY SAID YET MAYBE THINGS HAVE

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.450
CHANGED AND WE SHOULD BE

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:22.452
ACTUALLY SEPARATING OUR ANALYSIS

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:24.320
OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE AND

00:55:24.387 --> 00:55:25.789
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.724
AND I THINK THAT THE PERSPECTIVE

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.225
OF WHAT THE COURT SAID WAS IF

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.627
YOU LOOK AT DUE PROCESS FOR

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:31.895
LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL

00:55:31.961 --> 00:55:34.330
TAXPAYER IS IT FAIR TO ASSESS.

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.666
OUR LAWS ON THAT TAX PAYER NAY

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:38.001
TH THOUGHT THAT IF YOU ARE

00:55:38.068 --> 00:55:39.636
PURPOSELY AVAILING YOURSELF OF

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.104
THE MARKET IN THAT STATE THAT

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.039
WAS ENOUGH FOR DUE PROCESS.

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:44.441
BUT IN QUILTS A FORCE COMMERCE

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:45.742
CLAUSE IS THAT WE LOOK AT THE

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.510
WHOLE MARKET NOT JUST THE EFFECT

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:49.245
ON THAT ONE TAXPAYER AND

00:55:49.312 --> 00:55:50.647
EFFECTIVE THE WHOLE MARKET IS

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:52.048
YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER SIX

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.583
THOUSAND TAXING JURISDICTIONS AT

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.218
ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.586
DEFINITIONS AND FILING

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.121
PROCEDURES AND THAT COULD.

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:00.724
IMPEDE INTERSTATE COMMERCE SO WE

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.358
THINK THE BETTER STANDARD WOULD

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:03.893
BE YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.994
IN THE STATE.

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:06.629
AND THAT WAS THOUGHT OF AS BEING

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.965
A BRIGHT LINE TEST THOUGH THE

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.300
REALITY IS AS PEOPLE START

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:12.001
THINKING ABOUT IT AND LOOKING AT

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.670
A VARIETY OF FACT PATTERNS WHAT

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:15.138
EXACTLY IS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.706
FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE SENDS AN

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.641
EMPLOYEE INTO A STATE FOR TWO

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.043
DAYS TO HELP INSTALL.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.678
SOME EQUIPMENT WOULD THAT BE

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.079
CONSIDERED A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.447
THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT LOCATION

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:25.782
AFTER COIL --

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.817
AS TO WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:31.788
PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE RULING

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:32.889
STILL NESTLE.

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:33.890
GOV ARE THE SAME THEY ARE THE

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:37.327
SAME FROM STATE TO STATE

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:40.930
UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN BRING THAT

00:56:40.997 --> 00:56:42.365
DEFINITION IS OF PHYSICAL

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:43.867
PRESENCE AS WAS DESCRIBED

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.802
EARLIER LIKE IN THE AB ONE FIFTY

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.203
FIVE AND MANY AMAZON TYPE CLICK

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.672
THROUGH LAWS THAT MANY STATES --

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:53.810
HAD ENACTED --

00:56:53.877 --> 00:56:55.011
FOR SO FAR AS THE OTHER QUILL

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.113
BEING YOU KNOW THIS MAJOR --

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.916
DECISION BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:00.984
TWO THAT CASE DID SHAPE OF

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.585
BUSINESS DECISIONS WERE MANY

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.287
BUSINESSES CERTAINLY WERE TRYING

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:05.789
TO AVOID A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:06.823
THE STATE I THINK IS THE

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:08.992
COMMERCE GREW YOU COULD SEE.

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:11.094
PRICE COMPETITION WOULD BE WHY

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:12.562
THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:13.663
YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW AMAZONS

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:14.764
A BIG COMPANY WHAT'S THE BIG

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.900
DEAL COLLECTING SALES TAX IT WAS

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.668
A PRICE COMPETITION I THINK.

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:19.469
BUT THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING AWAY

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:21.905
FAIR MAJORITY WAS POINTING OUT

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.139
THAT THEY'RE WORSE LIKE.

00:57:23.206 --> 00:57:25.074
LIKE A TAX SHELTER BEING CREATED

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:30.146
BY A BY THE QUILL DECISION.

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:31.080
SUPPORTERS OF WHAT WILL BE THE

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.148
EFFECT OF WHEY FAIR OF NOW

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:32.782
SAYING WILL THAT QUILL PHYSICAL

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.417
PRESENCE THAT'S NIGHT NOT THE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:35.451
RIGHT STANDARD.

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:36.820
THIS IS GOING TO ALSO HAVE AN

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:39.589
EFFECT ON YOU COMMERCE IN MANY

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:41.691
AN UNKNOWN WAYS FOR EXAMPLE SOME

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:43.259
VENDORS MIGHT DECIDE THEY'RE NOT

00:57:43.326 --> 00:57:45.428
GOING TO ENGAGE IN E. COMMERCE

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:47.697
OR AS MUCH YOU COMMERCE.

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.132
I DO NOTE YOUR NECKLACE ONLY BE

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.767
VENDORS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.468
SELLING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

00:57:52.535 --> 00:57:53.636
MIGHT WANT TO RESTRICT THEIR

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.738
ACTIVITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:56.239
TO HAVE THE COLLECTION

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.675
OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER STATES SO.

00:57:58.741 --> 00:57:59.642
WHAT THE EFFECT ON E. COMMERCE

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:00.977
WERE STILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.478
EFFECT IS ON ON WAY FAIR AND

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.646
WHAT ALL THE STATES ARE GONNA DO

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.748
IN RESPONSE? TO THE WAY FAIR

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:06.683
CASE --

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.017
THEY'LL CERTAINLY BE AFFECTS ON

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.619
CONSUMERS I THINK THE WAY FAIR

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:11.354
CASE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.656
UNDERSTAND THAT YES THERE

00:58:13.723 --> 00:58:15.525
ACTUALLY IS SALES TAX WHEN YOU

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:16.960
BUY SOMETHING THAT STANGEL

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.494
PERSONAL PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:20.296
EVEN IF YOU WERE NOT CHARGED IT

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:21.898
BY THE VENDOR --

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.132
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF MAYBE

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:25.235
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD TAKE

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:26.669
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH HEY NO

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:27.804
GUESS WHAT THERE WAS A SALES TAX

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:29.405
MAYBE JUST WANNA BY LOCAL AS

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:30.506
OPPOSED --

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:33.009
TO BUYING FROM.

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:37.647
FROM OUTSIDE THE THE EFFECT OF

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:38.248
THE DIFFICULT DECISION HAD A

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.016
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE SHAPE

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.351
OF STATE TAX SYSTEMS THE STATE'S

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:43.152
REPLACE THAT LOST REVENUE

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.587
PERHAPS WITH OTHER REVENUE.

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:46.556
NOW -- YES

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.791
WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE OWE USE TAX

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.326
BUT AS THE IN THE SUPREME COURT

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:52.262
POINTED OUT ONLY ABOUT 4% OF USE

00:58:52.328 --> 00:58:54.564
TAX DOES CUT GET COLLECTED --

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:55.632
I'D LIKE TO THINK MAYBE THE

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.267
PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER IN IN

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:58.534
CALIFORNIA WITH A FEW THINGS

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.203
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO TRY

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.537
TO INCREASE STEP IS STILL PRETTY

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:03.006
LOW PERCENTAGE AND YOU CAN SEE

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:03.740
FROM.

00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:04.574
A SOME OF THE DATA BEING

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.843
PROVIDED TODAY BY OTHER SPEAKERS

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.410
THAT.

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:09.879
OF THAT UNCOLLECTED USE TAX IT'S

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:11.681
NOT OLD BUSINESS TO CONSUMER

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:13.283
IT'S ALSO BUSINESS THE BUSINESS

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:14.384
HIS BUSINESS IS NOT TO SAY

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:18.788
COLLECTING USED TAX AS WELL.

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:19.689
THE THE EFFECT ON THE STATE AND

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:20.823
LOCAL TAXES OF THE WAY FOR

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:21.791
DECISION WILL FOR THE AFFECT

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.159
STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES AND

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.728
SOME BUSINESSES BEYOND SALES TAX.

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.530
THIS NEW DISA VALANCE OF A

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:29.299
PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.833
THAT'S NECESSARY FOR HAVING

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.069
COMMERCE CLAUSE NEXUS.

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.804
DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO SALES TAX

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.806
SEXUAL PLIES TO ALL TYPES OF

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:39.008
TAXES IS A SOMETHING ELSE TO BE

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.710
BE THINKING ABOUT ANY RELEVANCE

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:42.045

AND THEN I ALSO HAVE.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.251
IN ANOTHER BESIDE THE OUTLINE I

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:49.752
HAD ARTICLES PUBLISHED TODAY

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.220
TALKING ABOUT SOME MORE

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:51.788
STAKEHOLDER --

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:53.456
CONCERNS THE GILMORE TO THE IN

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.725
THE WAY FAIR CASE WAS A FIVE

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:56.793
FOUR DECISIONS OF A OF A CLOSE

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.962
DECISION BEGIN OVERTURNING FIFTY

00:59:59.028 --> 00:59:59.562
YEARS A PRESIDENT'S IS A BIG

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.563
DEAL.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.898
THE COURT DID CONCLUDE THAT THE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.366
PHYSICAL PRESENCE WILL OF QUILL

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.802
IS ON SOUND AND IN CORRECT.

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:08.538
AND AGAIN THE KEY FAXES AND TWO

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:09.138
THOUSAND SIXTEEN SOUTH DAKOTA

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.173
ALONG WITH THAT THE OTHER STATES

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.307
TRYING TO CHALLENGE GETTING A

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.077
CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:14.844
BECAUSE THEY WERE.

01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:16.579
TIRED OF WAITING FOR CONGRESS TO

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:17.513
TAKE ACTION AND I'VE DONE THIS A

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.648
BLAME CONGRESS FOR NOT TAKING

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.316
ACTION BECAUSE THEY WERE HEARING

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.684
ONE THING FROM STATES AND%

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.387
SEVERAL THINGS FROM FROM VENDORS.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.989
BUT COULD NOT STOP THE CODE

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:27.991
ENACTED S. ONE OH SIX TO REQUIRE

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.026
CERTAIN REMOTE SELLERS TO

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.627
COLLECT SALES TAX THEY CALL THAT

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:33.496
EMERGENCY LEGISLATION DUE TO A

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:34.964
NEED FOR REVENUE.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.867
SELLERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS IF

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:42.438
THEY TAX IF ON THE ANNUAL BASIS

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.040
THEY DELIVERED OVER A HUNDRED

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:45.041
THOUSAND OF GOODS OR SERVICES

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.142
INTO THE STATE.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:47.777
OR HAD TWO HUNDRED OR MORE

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.212
TRANSACTIONS OF IN STATE

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:50.847
DELIVERIES AND THIS CHANGE

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:52.515
APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY WITH THAT

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.584
THE LADY PENDING A SHOWING OF

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:56.052
CONSTITUTIONALITY.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:58.021
A SOUTH DAKOTA BROAD ACTION

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:59.355
AGAINST THREE SELLERS I I DO

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.957
WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THESE THREE

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:04.160
SELLERS WASTE WAYFAIR OVERSTOCK

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.495
DOT COM AND NEWEGG.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:07.230
EACH HAVE ANNUAL REVENUE OF OVER

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:08.765
BILLION DOLLARS THESE WERE LARGE

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.166
VENDORS BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE A

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.367
PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN SOUTH

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.435
DAKOTA SO WE'RE NOT --

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:16.039
COLLECTING.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.206
OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA LOST IN THE

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.008
STATE COURTS BECAUSE OF THE

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:20.910
QUILL DECISION AND EVENTUALLY

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.345
THIS THEY'D PETITION TO THE

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.913
SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.481
DECIDED TO TAKE THE CASE AND I

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.816
DO ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.651
AS THIS --

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:29.852
DIFFERENCE BEEN COURT TODAY TAKE

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.220
THE CASE THERE WAS A LITTLE OVER

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:33.356
FIFTY AMICUS BRIEFS FILED WHICH

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.323
PROVIDE A LOT MORE BACKGROUND OF

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.758
PEOPLE OF FROM VARIOUS

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:36.793
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHETHER

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.262
THEY'RE LIKE EBAY AT SEA STATES

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:41.030
OF THE US GOVERNMENT.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.465
OTHERS AND PROVIDE A GOOD NUMBER

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.167
BACKGROUND SO FAR AS CONCERNS

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:45.501
THEY HAVE WITH WHAT HAPPENED IF

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:50.006
A QUILL WAS TO BE CHANGED.

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.074
ON THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HELD

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.408
A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS THE WRONG

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:55.111
STANDARD FOR COMMERCE CLAUSE AND

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:57.046
SALES TAX NEXUS PURPOSES THEY GO

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.348
THROUGH A REVIEW OF EVEN OLD

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.683
COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISDICTION

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:02.051
DATING BACK TO THE EARLY

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.052
EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.353
A BUT THEY DO STILL TALK ABOUT

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.488
THE COMPLETE COMPLETE AUTO

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.657
TRANSIT VERSUS BRADY --

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.192
IS STILL A VALID STANDARD THEY

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:10.660
JUST SAID HOW WE HAD INTERPRETED

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.528
THAT FIRST PART OF THAT FOUR

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:16.699
PART TEST AS YELLED THAT APPLIES --

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:20.303
TO AND WITH SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.804
WITH THE STATE THAT JUST SHOULD

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.339
NOT BE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:27.143
STANDARD THERE.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.344
ARE THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE THEY

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.046
SAID WAS CONTRARY TO MODERN

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.047
COMMERCE CLAUSE APPLICATION AND

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.449
IS ARBITRARY FORMALISTIC MEASURE

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.951
IT DOES NOT PUT BUSINESSES ON AN

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.385
EVEN PLAYING FIELD AS IT DOES

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.321
NOT CONSIDER THE SIZE OF

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:39.388
BUSINESSES AND IMPOSES A

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:40.923
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.858
BUSINESSES.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.292
WITH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.694
COMPARED TO NON PRESENT SELLERS

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:45.628
SO AGAIN THEY WEREN'T AS A

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:46.562
SIGNING WAS ADVANCES IN

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.364
TECHNOLOGY THAT CALLS AND TO GET

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.966
THIS NEW INTERPRETATION OF

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.000
WHAT'S COMMERCE CLAUSE

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.469
JURISDICTION AS IT WAS THEY JUST

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.204
THOUGHT EVEN BACK IN NINETEEN

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:55.838
EIGHTY TWO IT WASN'T LIKE A FAIR

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:56.105
STANDARD.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:03:01.010
THAT THEY HAD PUT IN PLACE A TO

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.945
FORMALISTIC AND NOT NOT.

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:03.579
ARE THEY ALSO DO KNOW THOUGH

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:04.580
THAT TECHNOLOGY USED ANY

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.015
COMMERCE HAS GIVEN RISE THE NEW

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.617
TYPES OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN A

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:08.885
RETAILER IN A STATE.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.786
AND A VIRTUAL SHOW ROOM CAN SHOW

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.288
FOR MORE INVENTORY AND FOR MORE

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:13.289
DETAIL AND WITH GREATER

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.790
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMER AND

01:03:14.857 --> 01:03:16.659
SELLER INTERACTION IT MIGHT BE

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:17.860
POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL STORES.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:19.162
THEY'RE SAYING IS EVEN A RICHER

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:20.429
CONNECTION YOU COULD HAVE WITH

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.265
YOUR CUSTOMERS IN ECON RESCIND

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.332
VARMINT WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:25.334
PRESENCE AGAIN CHALLENGING WHAT

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:26.335
SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.837
SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:28.905
DOES A RULE THAT IGNORE THE

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.373
SUBSTANTIAL VIRTUAL CONNECTIONS

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:33.809
THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE RETAINED.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:35.912
THE DISSENTERS IN THE CASE SAID

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.314
WILL IT MUCH BETTER IF THE

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.316
CONGRESS WOULD RESULT THESE

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:41.083
ISSUES OF COURSE THINK SOME

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.018
RELUCTANCE TO OVERTURN ALL THIS

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.052
PRESIDENT.

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.520
BUT THE MAJORITY RESPONDED TO

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.422
THAT SAYING IT'S INCONSISTENT

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.157
WITH THE COURTS PROPER ROLE TO

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.992
ASK CONGRESS TO ADDRESS A FALSE

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:51.861
CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISE OF THIS

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:53.229
COURT'S OWN CREATION.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.397
IT IS CURRENTLY THE COURT AND

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:55.698
NOT CONGRESS THAT IS LIMITING

01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:57.867
THE LAWFUL PROVIDENCE OF THE

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:58.401
STATE'S.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.703
SO AGAIN ALL THE COURT HELD WAS

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.139
YES PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS NOT THE

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.373
STANDARD --

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.609
FOR ANY KIND OF TAX NEXUS AND IT

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.810
SAID WELL WHAT IS A OKAY

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:08.911
STANDARD THAT'S NOT GONNA

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.013
VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE THEY

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.148
SAID WELL SOUTH DAKOTA WHICH IS

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:15.418
THE LAW BEFORE US THEIR SB A ONE

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.086
OH SIX THAT'S ALL WE CAN

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:19.956
EVALUATE WHAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:21.224
THE CALENDAR YEAR WHETHER THE

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.758
THE PAST CALENDAR YEAR OR THE

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.560
CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR IF YOU HAD

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:26.562
MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:27.129
DOLLARS OF SALES AND TO THE

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.631
STATE OR TWO HUNDRED OR MORE

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.966
TRANSACTIONS.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.300
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAY YOU

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.468
HAD SALES TAX COLLECTION

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.370
OBLIGATIONS THERE AND THEY ALSO

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:35.504
POINTED OUT THAT THE SOUTH

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.640
DAKOTA LAW WAS NOT RETROACTIVE.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.041
AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.077
SOUTH DAKOTA WAS A MEMBER OF THE

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.012
STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX --

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:45.014
AGREEMENT WHICH HAD SOME

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.616
SIMPLIFICATIONS AND IT SUCH AS

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.917
SOME STANDARD DEFINITIONS AT

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.819
LEAST AMONG THE MEMBER STATES

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.554
AND IT HAD SOME OF THE

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:53.022
PROTECTION FOR THE REMOTE

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.024
SELLERS SUCH AS THE STATES ARE

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:57.360
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE TO

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:58.928
THE REMOTE SELLERS.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.230
AND AT NO COST TO THE REMOTE

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:01.831
SELLERS AND IT DOES REMOTE

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:04.200
SELLERS USE THAT SOFTWARE THEY

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.868
ALSO GET AUDIT PROTECTION.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:07.303
SO THEY DID STRESS THAT AGAIN

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:08.604
THAT'S YOUR THINK YOU KNOW HOW

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:09.272
COULD.

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:11.474
OTHER STATES GO AND SAY WHAT CAN

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.075
WE MATCH SOUTH DAKOTA LAW.

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:14.243
PROBABLY MATCHING THE FIRST PART

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.544
THE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE TUNER

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:16.379
TRANSACTIONS AND THE NOT

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.180
RETROACTIVE THAT'S PRETTY EASY

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.182
TO DO BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.951
THAT CALIFORNIA AND MANY STATES

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.519
RETCHING NOT MEMBERS OF THE

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.054
STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX.

01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:25.921
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:29.959
CHALLENGE AS TO WHAT CAN WE DO

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.027
TO SAY.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:34.030
THE COURT IF THEY LOOKED AT ARES

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:38.834
WOULD SAY YES CAL THE THERE.

01:05:38.901 --> 01:05:39.935
SO FAR AS YOUR STATE

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:42.405
CONSIDERATIONS IT REALLY IS AS

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.340
YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.274
MEAN FOR OUR STATE [inaudible]

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:48.778
AND I DO LIST OF RIGHTY OF OF

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.479
CONSIDERATIONS HERE --

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.315
FOR THE STATE TO NEED TO TAKE A

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:54.350
LOOK AT HERE --

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.886
AS TO HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT WE

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.421
ARE OR NOT IN THE STREAMLINED

01:05:58.487 --> 01:05:59.622
SALES AND USE TAX YOU MIGHT

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:00.856
THINK WELL MAYBE THAT WOULD BE

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.091
AN EASY THING TO DO THOUGH I

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.693
THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.960
VERY CAREFULLY AT THAT BECAUSE

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.062
ONE THING ABOUT THE GOVERNING

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:06.996
BOARD THE STREAMLINED.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:09.098
SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT IT'S

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:10.566
ONE VOTE PER STATE.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.101
ALMOND FOR EXAMPLE A SOUTH

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:13.502
DAKOTA HAS LESS THAN A MILLION

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.137
POPULATION WE'VE GOT FORTY

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.872
MILLION --

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.607
POPULATION HERE.

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.009
I'M ALSO HOW SHOULD ANY MEASURE

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.777
OF GROSS RECEIPTS SUPPLY DEMAND

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.145
AND WE SHOULDN'T THING VIEW ALL

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.080
THE SOUTH DAKOTA LAWS CAN BE

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.581
VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD.

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.716
OF HOW DO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.250
MEASURE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:29.952
SALES IS THAT LOOKING AT ALL

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.521
TRANSACTIONS JUST TAXABLE ONES --

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.956
WHAT WOULD BE A SIMPLE WAY TO

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.091
DEAL WITH THAT --

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.360
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AVOIDING

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.261
FUTURE LITIGATION WHAT ABOUT

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:41.030
THIS THRESHOLD OF TWO HUNDRED OR

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:44.166
LESS TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE.

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.034
THAT WASN'T THE CASE THAT WAS A

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:47.503
FOR THE COURT BUT THAT COULD BE

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.671
TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS OF A

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.373
DOLLAR EACH --

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.074
I SAID I WOULD PROJECTED THAT'S

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.109
GOING TO LEAD TO FUTURE

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.276
LITIGATION THE STATES THAT ARE

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:57.179
ADOPTING OF THAT STANDARD.

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:59.615
ALSO WE WANT TO BE ADDRESSING.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.484
WHEN DOES NEXUS START WHEN DOES

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.452
IT END WHAT IF SOMEONE SALES

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.755
DROP BELOW THAT THAT THRESHOLD

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:06.288
THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.357
CONSIDER --

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:09.725
SO THE ANY CHANGE WERE DOING IN

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:13.262
CALIFORNIA CLEAR AS POSSIBLE

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.197
WHEN YOU DO AND DO NOT HAVE HAVE

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.098
NEXUS.

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.900
IS BY THE BEST WAY TO GO SO FAR

01:07:17.967 --> 01:07:19.568
AS AVOIDING FUTURE LITIGATION

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:20.836
AND ENSURING THAT YOU'RE GOING

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.438
TO HAVE -- A

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:23.873
PROPER AND HOPEFULLY SIMPLE

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.641
COMPLIANCE.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.177
AS TO WHAT AT ALSO WE NEED TO

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:30.179
LOOK AT WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.514
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.481
MINUTES LOCAL OVER THE FOR COULD

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.816
SAY HEY PHYSICAL PRESENCE YOU'VE

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.284
GOTTA COLLECT HERE THAT WAS

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:36.685
PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD WHAT

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.387
WILL BE THE MEASURE NOW.

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.188
AND COURSE AT THE LOCAL

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:40.956
GOVERNMENT LETTER LEVEL WE DO

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.659
HAVE VARYING SOURCING APPROACHES

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.828
IN THAT THE DISTRICT TAX GOES ON

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.464
A DESTINATION SOURCING AND THE

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:50.633
SALES TAX GOES ON THE ORIGIN

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.201
SOURCING WHICH CAN.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.269
AS WE CHANGE A NEXUS STANDIFER

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.870
LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SOME

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:56.572
IMPACT PERHAPS TO OF LOCAL

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.307
GOVERNMENT AND HOW THAT SHOULD

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.508
BE EXPLAINED.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.543
AS THE WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:01.577
NEXUS STANDARD GIVEN NOT ONLY

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:02.745
THE WAY FAIR DECISION BUT

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:04.814
ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS AND

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.614
REALITIES.

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:06.916
AGAIN SOUTH DAKOTA HAD A

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:08.884
POPULATION OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:09.518
SEVENTY THOUSAND WE HAVE FORTY

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.587
MILLION THAT MEANS IF WE WERE TO

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.856
ADOPT THE SOUTH DAKOTA THRESHOLD

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.124
AT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND SALES

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.692
INTERNET OR MORE TRANSACTIONS.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.627
WE WOULD HAVE FAR MORE REMOTE

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.596
SELLERS AND SOUTH DAKOTA WILL

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:21.130
BECAUSE WE HAVE FAR MORE

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:22.565
CONSUMERS --

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.767
IN THIS STATE SO.

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:26.735
UPSET BE A NEED TO BE

01:08:26.802 --> 01:08:29.839
CONSIDERING HOW TO ALSO FAIRNESS

01:08:29.905 --> 01:08:31.407
CAN ALL VENDORS THE SUBJECT TO

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.475
COLLECTION DURING NEW STANDARD

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.577
BE TREATED SIMILARLY IN TERMS OF

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.744
ENFORCEMENT MEAN IF TO SAY WE'RE

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:36.779
GONNA HAVE A CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.047
FOR THOSE WE CAN EASILY REACH IN

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:38.614
THE STATE.

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.915
AND THOSE OUTSIDE THE STATE WE

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:40.916
MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME

01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.852
ENFORCEMENT COULD BE --

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:44.153
A CONCERN THERE.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.721
ALSO COURSE UNDER REVENUE

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.190
TAXATION SIXTY TWO OR THREE SEE

01:08:48.257 --> 01:08:50.059
IT DOES ALSO LOOK LIKE MAYBE THE

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:50.960
VENDOR SHOULD JUST START

01:08:51.026 --> 01:08:52.928
COLLECTING BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:54.864
ARE CONSIDERED A VENDOR --

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.432
IN THIS A RETAILER ENGAGED IN

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.200
BUSINESS IN THE STATE IF YOU

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.802
MEET THE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS AS

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:02.137
THE FINE BY THE CONSTITUTION

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:02.771
WHICH IS A CREAM COURT JUST TO

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:03.772
FIND -- I

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:05.174
THINK THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGING

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.876
TO SOON VENDORS WOULD JUST START

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:09.211
OF START DOING THAT.

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.246
AS WELL AS STATES ARE DOING MANY

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.014
STATES SEEM TO BE GOING WITH THE

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.250
SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD AND EVEN

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.551
MAKING EFFECTIVE PERHAPS YOU'D

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.353
LIKE TO OCTOBER FIRST NOVEMBER

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:18.187
FIRST.

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.255
I THINK ALSO HAS TO BE

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.323
CONSIDERATION OF HOW QUICKLY CAN

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.492
A VENDOR START COLLECTING HOW

01:09:23.559 --> 01:09:25.895
QUICKLY CAN THE CD TFA HELP THAT

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.963
VENDOR GET COMPLIANT AND INTO

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:30.199
THE SYSTEM --

01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:30.766
SO YOU KNOW THE SPACE THAT

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.067
SOMEBODY JUST CROSS THAT

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:33.769
THRESHOLD AND NOW HAD TO START

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.538
COLLECTING IS NOT REALLY A A LOT

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.339
OF TIME TO BE --

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:39.375
TO BE DEALING WITH.

01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:41.644
A SO IT'S A MANY MANY --

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.078
CAN CONSIDERATIONS HERE MANY

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:46.415
STAKEHOLDERS AND INVOLVED HERE.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:49.552
ALSO IS IN OF MY FINAL COMMENTS

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:50.920
HEARING ON GET.

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:51.420
TO KNOW YOUR TO GET THE

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.355
QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WE ALSO

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:54.323
SHOULD BE LIKE TO VIEW THINGS AS

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.124
AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.825
PRESS IS ALSO OPPORTUNITY THAN

01:09:56.892 --> 01:09:58.093
LOOKING AT WHAT THIS WAY FAIR

01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.628
MEAN FOR THE STATE AND DO WE

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.196
WANT TO BE SPECIFIC ON WHAT THE

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:02.498
NEXUS STANDARD WILL BE IN THE

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:03.666
STATE THAT WE THINK COULD BE IN

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.934
LINE WITH THE NEW.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.635
CONGRESS CLASS INTERPRETATION

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.137
FROM THE WAY FAIR CASE BUT IT

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:09.939
SHOULD ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.440
MAKE OTHER CHANGES TO THE SALES

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:13.042
TAX THAT MIGHT OF FURTHER

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:14.143
IMPROVE IT --

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:16.045
WE'D WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW A

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:18.380
FAIRLY HIGH RATE --

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:20.716
WE HAVE.

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:21.984
OF A. B. OTHER RULES NEED TO BE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.752
CLARIFIED LCD LOOK AT THIS ANY

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:24.753
HOUSES CHANGE THINGS ABOUT DROP

SHIPMENT OR OCCASIONAL SALES ANY

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.190
OTHER CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE --

01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.125
ADDRESS THEIR ANY OPPORTUNITIES

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:32.494
AND AS ALWAYS PROPOSALS PERHAPS

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.330
TO BROADEN THE BASE TO REMOVE A

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.365
CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS A TIME FOR

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.567
LOOKING AT THAT.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.470
AND COURSE.

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:42.438
WITH ALL THAT COULD BE DONE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.906
TOGETHER AS A LOGICAL WAY HE GOT

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.441
UP WE HAVE A OF AN EFFECTIVE

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.176
SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM THAT'S

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.310
GONNA BE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.311
GOVERNMENT.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:51.113
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE

BUSINESSES WE HAVE TO REALIZE

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:55.417

AS OUR OWN VENDORS AND THE STATE.

01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:02.691
DEALING WITH THE STATE'S THAT

01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:04.159
THEY HAVE REMOTE SALES AND

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.861
OUTSIDE OF A CALIFORNIA WHICH

A CALL SOME CONSIDERATION OF

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:12.501
SHOULD CONGRESS.

TO PUT SOME STANDARD IN PLACE OF

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:14.970
SO THERE COULD BE SOME

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.472
CONSISTENCY FOR ALL VENDORS

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:17.906

FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.018
PRESENTATION IT'S EXTREMELY

01:11:29.084 --> 01:11:30.486
COMPLICATED AND I THINK YOUR

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.154
PRESENTATION GIVES US MUCH MORE

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.922
DETAIL AND SHOWS US ALL HOW

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:36.025
ACTUALLY TRULY MORE COMPLICATED

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:38.293
EVEN THAT MAYBE WE REALIZED IT

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.195
IS -- I I DO

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.097
WANT TO ASK A QUESTION I REALIZE

01:11:42.164 --> 01:11:43.232
THAT AT SOME POINT THE THE

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.034
NOTION OF A PHYSICAL PRESENT

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.235
BECAME ANTIQUATED HOWEVER THE

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.871
THE ISSUE THE REASON THE

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:49.938
PHYSICAL PRESENCE --

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.273
KIND OF STANDARD CAME ABOUT WAS

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.975
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.376
KIND OF OF THE COLD THE

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:55.444
COLLECTION OBLIGATION WHICH

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:56.879
CLEARLY STILL EXISTS AS IF NOT

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.580
WORSE NOW THAN WHEN THAT

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.115
STANDARD WAS PUT INTO PLACE.

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:02.751
AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS AS

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:08.057
LONG AS WE'RE CALIFORNIA'S NOT

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.358

SITUATION AND WE ARE AN ADVISORY

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.528

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:13.429
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.997

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:17.066
IT.

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.635
WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:20.803
ARE THERE IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:23.272

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:24.039
THIS?

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:24.606

FUNDING FOR THAT TO OCCUR SO IT

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.378
COULD BE --

GOVERNING BOARD OF STREAMLINED

MEETING WHERE THEY WERE ASKING

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.612
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD

WE LET NON MEMBER STATES

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.615

WHICH HAS BROUGHT SOME

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:49.224
SUPPLICATION BUT NOT.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.993
AS SIMPLE AS WE MIGHT THINK IF

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.694
YOU WERE GO TO THEIR WEBSITE

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.396
EVERY STATE HAS TO HAVE A TAX

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.298
ABILITY MATRIX.

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:58.333
WHERE MOTHERS COMMON DEFINITIONS

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.202
THE STATE CAN STILL DECIDE WE

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.637
WANT TO TAX OR NOT TAXIS

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:03.205
COMPANIES TAX ABILITY MATTRESSES

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.207

SALES TAX AND THEN YOU CODE ALL

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.510

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.212
AMOUNTS TO TECHNOLOGY EXISTED DO

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.680
THAT BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:12.881
SOFTWARE YOU DO NEED HUMAN

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.550
BEINGS TO HELP.

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.617
OPERATE THAT SORT THERE ARE

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:19.254
COSTS INVOLVED IN ALL THAT --

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:19.922
SO YES THERE ARE SOME

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.256
SUPPLICATIONS THERE BY THINK WE

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.758
COULD LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT WE

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.459
STILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:25.527
PERHAPS HAVING TO JOIN THE

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.595
STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:27.729
BUT PROBABLY MONITORING WHAT

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.231
THEY ARE GOING TO BE.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:33.035
A DOING WILL THEY BE PUSHING

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.436

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:35.771
NON MEMBER STATES CAN CAN SIGN

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.040
ON TO THAT IS PUTTING TWENTY

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:38.674
THREE TWENTY FOUR STATES BELONG

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.175
TO STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.511
AND SO I READ YOUR ARTICLE THAT

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:44.413
SAYS CALIFORNIA WOULD NEVER JOIN.

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:45.514
SAYS THIS IS STREAMLINED SALES

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.684
AND USE TAX SO CAN I ASK WHY

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.519
WHAT ARE YOUR CHARITY I JUST

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.420
HEAR OPINION OBVIOUSLY I THINK

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:53.255
IS THE ONE VOTE PER STATE.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.790
AND I I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:55.490
HAPPENED RECENTLY BUT STILL

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.692
YEARS AGO THERE WERE OFTEN

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:59.761
CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:02.030
AND CYCLE HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:04.566
CHANGES DO YOU WANT TO THE SIZE

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.969
OF OUR STATE WILL WE SEE LARGE

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.737
STAGE JOINING IN --

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:10.706
SOME TODAY MIGHT WONDER WELL HOW

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:11.807
IMPORTANT IS TO STREAMLINED

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.742
SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT NOW

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:15.344
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT PHYSICAL

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.179
PRESENCE STANDARD WE COULD JUST

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:20.148
SAY HEY IT'S OVER A HUNDRED

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:20.616
THOUSAND AND TWO OTHER

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:21.116
TRANSACTIONS [inaudible]

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.653
BUT YET IT MEMBER CAN SIGN ON TO

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.255
VIEW MORE THOSE DEFINITIONS

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.689
PERHAPS I THINK IT'S STILL BE

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.625
WORTH LOOKING AT BUT THE ONE

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.326
VOTE PER STATE IS THAT.

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.794
SOUNDS TROUBLING BECAUSE I WAS

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.529
WHICH IS SUCH A LARGE STATE.

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:35.864
AND WE'RE FORTY TIMES THE SIZE

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:38.634
OF SOUTH DAKOTA.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.637
IS THERE WOULD.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:42.337
YES NO.

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:43.272
FEEL BUT I THINK ALSO WHAT WHAT

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:45.440
THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES TAX

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.409
COLLECTED UNITED STATES CONSERVE

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:48.443
CALIFORNIA RIGHT.

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.045
THE MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.213
POPULATION FOR RIGHT RIGHT ALSO

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.748
IT WAS IT WAS EVEN NOTED THAT

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:54.182
SOMEBODY'S LARGE VENDORS ALREADY

01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.951

01:15:56.018 --> 01:15:59.454
GAO REPORT THAT CAME OUT LATE

THAT -- NOT

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.260
I ALWAYS SAY IT NEVER BECAUSE

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:05.861
THEY WANT ONE VOTE FOR STATE

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:06.828
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.363
CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORKER --

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:12.501
TEXAS IS GOING TO SIGN ON TO BUT

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:14.269
IT'S WORTH MONITORING AS

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.470
EVERYTHING ELSE IS BEING LOOKED

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:17.239

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:18.573
NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT JUST A

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.042
COMMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.610

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.284
STATE.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:05.020
AS FAR AS POPULATION WEISS.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:05.354
IMPLEMENT --

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.788
IS MOVING ON THE USE TAX IN

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.490
BEING ABLE TO COLLECT WHICH

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.058
WHICH IS THE LARGEST STATE

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:11.159
QUIBBLING TO CALIFORNIA IF YOU

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.527
WILL -- HAD

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:16.331
MOVED WITH IMPLEMENTING.

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:16.898
SO FAR AS ADOPTING AWAY FOR

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:19.434
STANDARD --

01:17:19.501 --> 01:17:20.435
NO TAKE IT WE'RE JUST SAYING

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.805
TEXAS IS CLOSE.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:25.007
YES YOU MAY MAYBE.

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:25.907
MAYBE TEXAS OTHER STATES ARE

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.743
STILL WAITING TO SAY ANYTHING

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.077
SPECIFIC --

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:29.945
AND ALSO PROBABLY LIKE US

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:30.779
FIGURING OUT IS IT

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.848
ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGISLATIVE

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:36.151
APPROACH THERE BUT DELIVERY OF

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:36.785
THEM IN OUR LARGE STATES THAT

01:17:36.852 --> 01:17:38.420
ARE SIGNING ON TO WHAT LOOKS

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.988
LIKE.

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.490
YOU KNOW A LOW STANDARD BECAUSE

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.692
IT IN IN OUR STATE BEING SOLD

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.627
LARGE SO FAR AS NUMBER OF

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.095
CONSUMERS.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:47.963
THAT WOULD MEAN WILL HAVE A FAR

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.064
MORE REMOTE VENDORS THAN MOST

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:50.499
STATES WOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.567
WOULD BE EASY TO SAY VALIUM JUST

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.536
LOOKING FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:55.704
LIKE A CROWD FUNDING WEBSITE.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.439
AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RAISE

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.340
MONEY AND ALL WILL GIVE YOU --

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.808
YOU GIVE US TEN DOLLARS OR

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:00.642
TWENTY DOLLARS AND WILL SELL YOU

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.244
A CALENDAR WHEN WE RAISE A

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.378
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE STILL

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:04.746
SMALL BUSINESSES BUT COULD

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.314
EASILY HAVE TWO HUNDRED OR MORE

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.050
TRANSACTIONS IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:08.950
NOT -- IN

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.886
SOUTH DAKOTA SO I THINK WE ALSO

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:13.655
THE LOOK AT WHAT'S THE

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:16.224
APPROPRIATE BALANCE AND FORCED

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.893
SAY LESS STILL KEEP ON TRYING TO

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:19.327
COLLECT THE USE TAX.

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.363
VERSUS TRIED EIGHT MANAGED IS

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.799
VERY LARGE NUMBER OF REMOTE A

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.333
REMOTE VENDORS.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.835
BUT AT THE DOUBLE CHECK WHAT

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:27.769
SEEMS TO BE THE LARGEST STATE

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:28.437
THAT.

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:30.205
WENT WITH THE WAY FAIR STANDARD

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:34.409
SO FAR HAS SCREEN I'LL CHECKS AS

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.944
WELL AND IF HE KNOWS IS AN WALK

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:37.212
US THROUGH.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.514
DURING TIMES OF A DOWNTURN.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.950
IN HOW THAT WORKS IN REGARDS TO

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:42.984
COLLECTION.

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.020
UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THE HUNDRED

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:45.654
THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS TO

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.889
DAKOTA. HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:48.890
HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS A YEAR.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.659
SO AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:53.495
THRESHOLD WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:54.963
DIP BELOW TO THE WAY TO THE NEXT

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:58.266
TAX YEAR HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK --

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.468
IN WALKING THROUGH THAT.

01:18:59.534 --> 01:19:01.570
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND NOT

01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.305
ALL STATES ARE SPECIFIC ON THAT

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:07.175
AS TO WHEN IF EVER NEXUS ENDS --

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.277
SOME STATES WILL SAY WELL ONCE

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:10.779
SAID AND YOU STILL HAVE TO

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.013
COLLECT FOR ANOTHER YEAR

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.315
THINKING THAT SOME OF THAT.

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:15.617
NEXUS ACTIVITY STILL LINGERS ON

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:17.119
FOR THE NEXT YEAR --

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.687
WE CULTURALLY NEXUS BUT

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.122
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE.

01:19:20.188 --> 01:19:22.023
I THINK LAID OUT SPECIFICALLY SO

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.859
THAT VENDORS AREN'T ON CERTAIN

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.494
THEY KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY NEED TO

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.962
BE DOING SOME I JUST CONTINUE TO

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.296
COLLECT THINKING A SALES WOULD

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:29.664
GO UP AND THEY GOT THE SYSTEM IN

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:32.167
PLACE BUT IN SOME STATES IT

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.135
MIGHT BE CLEAR.

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:34.836
YOU DROP BELOW WHAT YOU CAN STOP

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:39.174
COLLECTING OTHER STATES --

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:41.610
MIGHT NOT SAY ANYTHING AT ALL

01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:42.711
THIS IS A TOWN SURPRISE HAD MANY

01:19:42.777 --> 01:19:43.278
STATES OF NOT ONLY ADDRESS

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:44.112
SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILING NEXUS

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.447
QUESTION.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:46.948
WHEN DOES IT END YEAH IT IN

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:49.017
THAT'S WHERE I THINK AND THAT'S

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:49.985
WHERE I FIRST WENT TO IS THAT --

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.086
ESPECIALLY FROM HAVING A BAD

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:51.786
YEAR RIGHT --

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.922
AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN FOR ME

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:54.723
LONG TERM.

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:56.958
OKAY.

01:19:57.025 --> 01:20:00.495
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH LESSONS

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.230
IN THE ROAD ANY GIVEN EXAMPLE --

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:03.698
I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY GOOD FOR

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.368
US THAT CALIFORNIA WAS THAT

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:07.102
THIRD STATE TO BE ABLE TO

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.069
IMPLEMENT.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.905
ALL CANNABIS RELATED TAXES WE

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.606
SAW WHAT HAPPENED --

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.408
IN COLORADO WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:14.976
IN WASHINGTON IN TRY NOT TO

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:15.977
REPEAT.

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.445
IF YOU WERE TO SAY MISTAKES THAT

01:20:17.512 --> 01:20:18.880
WERE MADE BY SOME STATES WHAT

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.182
WOULD YOU REPEAT AND WHAT ADVICE

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:23.451
WOULD YOU GIVE US AS WE MOVE

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:24.786
DOWN THIS ROAD.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:25.687
WELL I WOULD SUGGEST BEING

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.822
SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT A NEW NEXUS

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.291
STANDARD IS.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.625
AND BE THINKING OF IT FROM THE

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:33.995
PERSPECTIVE OF AVOIDING FUTURE

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:34.963
LITIGATION.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.697
MEAN.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:36.765
PERSONALLY I VIEW THIS TWO

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.833
HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS AS JUST TO

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.436
LOW I MEAN IF THAT WAS THE CASE.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.071
I THINK THE IF THAT WAS BEEN

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:43.838
WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE SUPREME

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:44.739
COURT.

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.141
I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE SAID NO

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.943
THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.678
RIGHT STANDARD.

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:50.245
UNLESS THE WHAT ANY DOLLAR

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.582
THRESHOLD IS AGAIN WEIGHING.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:56.051
HOW MANY REMOTE VENDORS WOULD

01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.319
THAT BE TO HAVE?

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:59.387
TO ENFORCE THE OF BE UNDER YOUR

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:01.323
ENFORCEMENT WEIGHING VERSUS MADE

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.991
WISHES ALL STAR COLLECTING USED

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:05.160
TAX AND YOU STILL HAVE TO CLICK

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.228
USE TAX MINNESOTA BE OBVIOUSLY

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.696
VENDORS THAT FALL BELOW THAT

01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:08.897
THRESHOLD.

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.465
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.200
REMOTE VENDORS THAT UNDER LIKE

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:14.903
SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.104
HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT SOMEBODY'S

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:16.705
VENDORS ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:19.641
STATES RATIONS AND THAT WOULD BE

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.209
I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF REMOTE

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:22.310
VENDORS FOR THE STATE OF

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:23.278
CALIFORNIA THINK BEING AS

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.546
SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.715
MAKING IT EASY FOR ANY VENDOR TO

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:28.683
KNOW DO I HAVE SALES TAX

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.418
COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS IN THE

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:31.987
STATE BUT IN THE OF LONGER

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:34.122
ARTICLE THAT.

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.790
I WROTE THAT'S OUT THERE SUGGEST

01:21:35.857 --> 01:21:36.958
ONE NOT EVEN CREATE SOME HAVE AN

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:38.627
ONLINE TOOL YOU'RE ASKED YOU

01:21:38.693 --> 01:21:40.195
KNOW TEN QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:42.297
AND WHEN WHATEVER ANSWER YOU GET.

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:44.165
AND YOU PUT THE YOUR ANSWERS AND

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.834
YELL AND GOOD FAITH.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.768
THAT'S YOUR STANDARD ARE YOU SUB

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:49.638
THE SALES TAX COLLECTION OR NOT --

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:52.040
MAKE SURE THAT THE CD TFA HAS

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.408
THE RESOURCES TO GIVE THE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:56.011
PROGRAM FROM NATION TO THESE NEW

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:57.445
NEW VENDORS MAKE IT CLEAR AS

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.913
POSSIBLE WHEN AT THE COLLECT.

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.582
AND YEAH I THINK WE WOULD NEED

01:22:00.649 --> 01:22:02.284
TO BE OFFERING A SOFTWARE TO THE

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:05.053
REMOTE THIS REMOTE SELLERS. TO

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.621
MAKE IT SO MORE TO THE

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.056
STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.491
AND THAT THE THEORETICALLY

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:10.992
SHOULD HELP IN THE COMPLIANCE.

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:13.161
BECAUSE HAS TO BE APPROVED BY

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:14.562
THE STATE THAT THIS IS THE

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.065
SOFTWARE ARE REALLY WORKS AND

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.199
THE COST IS GOING TO BE LOWER

01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.735
THAN WHAT THE ADDED COLLECTION.

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.404
OF WOULD BE I THINK MAKING IT AS

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.773
CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AS REALISTIC

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.341
WHATEVER WE THINK CAN REDUCE

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.777
FUTURE LITIGATION BY BEING TOO

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.211
LOW A STANDARD --

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:32.147
I THINK WOULD BE THE WELL SIR

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:35.650
FOR THE FOR THE STATE AND THEN

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.986
NOT FORGETTING ABOUT PLACE WITH

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:40.655
THEM AS TO HOW DOES THIS AFFECT.

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.957
THEIR DISTRICT TAXES THERE IS

01:22:43.024 --> 01:22:45.126
CHAIR OF THE SALES TAX THEIR

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.728
POOLING ARRANGEMENT AS TO HOW

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:47.829
YOU THE MONEY GOES IN THE COUNTY

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.564
POOL GETS ALLOCATED BACK OUT

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:50.732
IT'S A COMPLICATED --

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.802
PROCESS BUT HOW DOES THIS CHANGE

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:55.837
THEIR STANDARD AND WHAT WILL

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:57.105
MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO MAKE

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.273
SURE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.708
ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN A COST

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:00.942
EFFECTIVE MANNER.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:01.509
YEAH THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE

01:23:01.576 --> 01:23:02.344
TABLE AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.179
PIECES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.747
BASED OFF OF PROPOSITION --

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.717
ENCUMBERED SOURCES OF REVENUE SO

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.452
AS THAT THOSE FUNDS COME IN.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.119
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE A TO GO

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.387
INTO EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:14.022
POT SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE

01:23:14.089 --> 01:23:15.490
CALIFORNIA'S GIVE ME THAT MORE

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:16.057
COMPLICATED IN SOME OF THE

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:16.925
STATE'S.

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:21.262
IS WELL MY LAST QUESTION IS AN

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:22.263
ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.531
SO WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD --

01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:24.532
IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.134
ADOPTED STANDARD ABOUT

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.204
ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN TRICKY --

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.806
AND TO WALK US THROUGH THAT AT

01:23:31.873 --> 01:23:33.241
THE IT IF YOU DON'T MIND I THINK

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.442
IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO TELL

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.777
BECAUSE SOME OF THE STATES THAT

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.312
HAVE ADOPTED THE SOUTH DAKOTA

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.680
STANDARD DID MAKE IT EFFECTIVE

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.815
STARTING OCTOBER FIRST --

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:41.282
I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:43.151
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW DO THEY

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.053
REACH OUT TO EVEN IDENTIFY WHO

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.021
THESE NEW REMOTE SELLERS ARE

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:48.323
THAT MEET THAT THRESHOLD THAT

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:49.691
DON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.092
IN THE STATE.

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.329
BECAUSE AS A VARIETY OF WAYS

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:54.996
NEED TO MEET THEM IN SOME STATES

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:55.830
A BIT MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.766
SOME STATES TAX --

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.501
INTANGIBLE ITEMS WHERE SO IT'S

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:00.001
NOT LIKE --

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.536
I CAN CHECK THE UPS TRUCKS

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.571
COMING AND YOU KNOW INTO THE

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.140
STATE SO THEY'VE GOT A VARIETY

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:06.808
OF COUNSELING THAT STILL REMAINS

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.443
TO BE SEEN.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:09.677
PLUS I WOULD SAY.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.779
TELLING VENDORS ALL THE SUDDEN

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:12.247
OCTOBER FIRST YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:13.615
REGISTERED AND START COLLECTING

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:15.617
HERE I THINK THAT'S TOO SHORT OF

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.485
A TIME FRAME TO BE.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.088
BE EFFECTIVE.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.423
I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK THE

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:23.658
ONE IN THE YOU SAID AND IS GOING

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:24.926
TO MAKE ONE LAST COMMENT IS --

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:25.994
IN REGARDS TO WHAT SOME THE

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:26.928
RAMIFICATIONS WOULD BE I KNOW

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:29.764
THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERN SAID --

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.698
WE'LL SEE FOLK SHYING AWAY FROM

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.066
YOU COMMERCE I JUST CANNOT

01:24:32.133 --> 01:24:33.435
IMAGINE THAT I THINK THEY HAVE

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:34.102
IT THERE --

01:24:34.169 --> 01:24:37.772
AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE --

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.707
WHICH IS A CONCERN I JUST

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:40.542
SPECIALLY BEING FROM A SMALLER

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.210
COMMUNITY --

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:43.978
AND I DO THINK IT CREATES A BIT

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:46.014
OF AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD --

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.650
WITH BRICK AND MORTAR AND MAMA

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.417
POPS.

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:51.019
IN HAVING TO STEP UP TIME AND

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.387
TIME AGAIN.

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.154
YES NO NO NO I AGREE --

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.389
I THINK SOME VENDORS MIGHT

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.491
DECIDE IF THEY SHOULD THEY HAVE

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.092
THE LOW DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.661
THEY'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THAT

01:24:59.727 --> 01:25:01.429
BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE.

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:03.298
SALES OF JUST OVER TWO DOLLARS A

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:05.400
STATE NOT TO START COLLECTING

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.502
SALES TAX ON YOU YET THAT THAT

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.937
THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH ON THAT ONE

01:25:09.003 --> 01:25:10.238
BUT YET THEY'RE OVER THAT ARE

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:10.839
THOUSAND THAT MIGHT BE THERE

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.707
GOOD SIZE BUSINESS AND COULD

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:13.741
COULD HANDLE THAT.

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:16.511
ARE THE REMAINS REMAINS TO BE

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:17.946
SEEN AND I THINK USUALLY THE OF

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.614
THE VENDORS THE BRICK AND MORTAR --

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.282
OPPORTUNITY DENT THEN REMIND

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:22.283
FOLKS THAT YES YOU KNOW THE

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:23.551
SALES TAX IS MUCH BROADER AND

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.953
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE HEARING OF

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.087
IT MORE OFTEN.

01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.223
AND THE PEOPLE REMEMBERING TO

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:34.596
SHOP IN YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:34.896
[inaudible]

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.498
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:42.070
SENATOR MARK --

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:43.805
THANK PROFESSOR ALAN --

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:44.372
NOW THAT YOU'RE WRITTEN THE

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:45.740
ARTICLES YOU'RE THE SUBJECT

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:46.975
MATTER EXPERT SO.

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:47.675
APPRECIATE --

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:48.676
YOUR YOUR WORK --

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:49.611
THIS STREAMLINED SALES AND USE

01:25:49.677 --> 01:25:50.678
TAX AGREEMENT I WANT TO FOLLOW

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:51.713
UP ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:52.881
ASKED BY THE CHAIR --

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:54.549
BASED ON OUR DIALOGUE IT HAS A

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:55.583
BOARD.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:59.020
IT HAS ONE VOTE PER STATE OR

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.989
MEMBERS POTENTIALLY --

01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:02.657
IT HAS SEVEN SOFTWARE VENDORS

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:03.992
THAT RECOMMENDS --

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:05.727
YOU CAN REGISTER ONE STOP SHOP

01:26:05.793 --> 01:26:07.428
AND AND THEY PROMOTE ON THEIR

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:08.263
WEBSITE THAT THEY ARE A

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:09.697
SIMPLIFICATION.

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:11.499
MEASURE I TRY.

01:26:11.566 --> 01:26:12.634
TO GET MY ARMS AROUND THIS IT

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.169
WAS FORMED IN MARCH OF TWO

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:15.737
THOUSAND SO IT'S BEEN AROUND

01:26:15.803 --> 01:26:16.738
EIGHTEEN YEARS YOU'RE READY --

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:18.039
IT HAS TWENTY FOUR STATES IS

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:20.074
MEMBERS BUT IT ONLY REPRESENTS

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.509
31% OF THE UNITED STATES

01:26:21.576 --> 01:26:22.944
POPULATION.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:27.582
AND SO THE QUESTIONS I HAD --

01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:28.816
I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:30.084
ONE VOTE PER STATE I MEAN I WAS

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.819
PART OF A FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER

01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:33.688
COUNTY ORGANIZATION AND YOU KNOW

01:26:33.755 --> 01:26:35.023
AS LONG AS WE GAVE LOS ANGELES

01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.624
COUNTY AT LEAST ONE SEAT ON THE

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:37.525
BOARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:38.459
THAT.

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:39.928
YOU KNOW WE KIND OF TOOK CARE OF

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:42.063
THE SMALL VERSUS LARGE --

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.398
SIDE MAYBE THAT COULD BE

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:46.000
ADJUSTED BUT I'M I'M WONDERING

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:48.236
WHETHER OR NOT IF WE JOINED AS A

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:48.937
STATE.

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:50.438
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE MAJOR

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:52.640
MODIFICATIONS TO CONFORM.

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:53.975
IN THEN THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.177
QUESTION IS WHY EIGHTEEN YEARS

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:59.080
AND WE HAVEN'T.

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.415
WELL YEARS AGO I THINK WE WERE --

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:01.282
THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WE

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:03.885
WERE OBSERVING THAT THE THE

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:05.353
MATTER AND THAT THIS IS MANY

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.888
YEARS AGO WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.590
TO MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR REVENUE

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:10.658
TAXATION CO TO CONFORM TO WHAT

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:12.894
THE MODEL AGREEMENT IS AND I

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:14.429
HAVEN'T DONE A SURVEY AS TO HOW

01:27:14.495 --> 01:27:15.363
MANY CHANGES THOSE ARE.

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:17.565
MAYBE THE CD TFA HAS A BETTER

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:19.734
IDEA AS TO THE NUMBER OF THOSE

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:23.438
OR STAFF HERE HAVE CHECKED HOW

01:27:23.504 --> 01:27:25.940
MANY CHANGES ARE GOING.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:28.309
SO MODIFYING WOULD BE ONE OPTION

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:30.011
ANOTHER WOULD BE MAYBE TO START

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.980
OUR OWN ORGANIZATION. FOR LARGER

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.781
STATES WHERE WE COULD BE A

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.116
LITTLE MORE INDEPENDENT LIKE A

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:35.984
TWO TIER.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.619
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:39.687
CONSIDER YEAH I I'VE I'VE RAISES

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.656
ARGUMENT FOR YEARS THAT YOU KNOW

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.191
ALL THE SMALL STATES CAN GATHER

01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:44.959
TOGETHER BECAUSE IT WILL IT WORK

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:46.861
WILL WAS SAYING THIS WHEN COURT

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:47.729
WAS SAYING AND QUILL.

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.397
ALL LOOK OUT THERE'S OVER SIX

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:50.365
THOUSAND TAXING JURISDICTIONS

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:51.966
ALL WITH DIFFERENT RULES WHILE

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:53.301
WE'RE BIG TAXING JURISDICTION

01:27:53.368 --> 01:27:55.236
WHY CAN'T WE BE ONE SET OF THE

01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:56.204
RULES IN NEW YORK WE ONE SET OF

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.305
RULES EVERYBODY ELSE JOIN

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:58.640
TOGETHER SO --

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.775
I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WOULD BE AT

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:04.178
CHALLENGE AT SOME POINT THAT.

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:05.480
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY.

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.115
VENDORS THAT WOULD BE DONE WITH

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:08.383
CALIFORNIA GET DOWN TO FEWER

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.717
NUMBER SYSTEMS BUT NEVER OFFICE

01:28:09.784 --> 01:28:11.352
HE CAME.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.021
TO CAN ANY KIND OF LITIGATION

01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:14.255
BUT YEAH THAT WE WERE THINK

01:28:14.322 --> 01:28:16.224
EXPLORING BECAUSE MAYBE WE SAY

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.759
WE WE'VE ADOPTED MAYBE SOME

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:18.960
SIMILARITIES.

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.662
AND SOME WITH SOME WE DO HAVE OF

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.030
SO FAR AS YOU KNOW THE TAX BEING

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:23.898
COLLECTED AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:24.899
THAN GOING BACK DOWN TO THE

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.901
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OPPOSED TO

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:27.702
HAVING TO COLLECT.

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:28.770
YOU KNOW.

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:29.837
FILE SEPARATE RETURNS FOR THE

01:28:29.904 --> 01:28:31.339
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE DO HAVE

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.840
SOME OF THINGS IN PLACE BUT I

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.042
THINK THAT BIG WORTH LOOKING AT

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.743
BECAUSE OUR MONEY PEOPLE WERE A

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.211
BIG STATE.

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:39.147
SO THEN WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.948
OF OF BEING INVOLVED WITH THE

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:43.051
THE STREAMLINED SALES AND TAX.

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:45.386
USE TAX AGREEMENT GROUP WOULD BE

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:47.855
THAT THEY WORRY IDENTIFIED.

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:49.857
ALL THIS ALL THE VENDORS YOU'RE

01:28:49.924 --> 01:28:50.591
USING THE TERM VENDORS.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:53.928
AND SO THAT WOULD SAVE MAYBE.

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.330
THIS STATE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:58.466
AND IN TRYING TO FIND WHO THEY

01:28:58.533 --> 01:28:59.767
NEED TO WRITE LETTERS.

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:01.135
TO AYE YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:03.304
POINT OF THEIR A REMOTE VENDOR

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.172
IN SOME OTHER STATE THEY'RE

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.940
PROBABLY REMOTE VENDOR HERE AS

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.442
WELL SO OR THAT WOULD HELP

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:10.545
IDENTIFY ALL OF THEM --

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.146
USING LIKE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ONE

01:29:12.213 --> 01:29:13.848
STOP SHOP WOULD WOULD MAKE SEEM

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.216
TO MAKE SENSE OF SOME FEATURES

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.350
THAT DO.

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:17.618
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE BY GEXA WOULD

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.220
COME DOWN TO COMPARING THE

SOME STATES ROUNDED UP AND SOME

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:36.904
AROUND THE DOWN IT WAS A BIG

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:37.939
DISPUTE?

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:39.373
BEFORE THEY COULD FOUND THE END

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.141
OF WHILE THEY RESOLVED AT THIS

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:43.411
POINT BUT YES BUT THERE WAS THIS

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:46.914

SO FIRST --

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:56.323
TO THE SALES AND USE.

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.591
TAX BACKGROUND WHICH ALREADY

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:58.826

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:11.138
ON TOP OF THAT RATE WE HAVE --

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:13.774
DISTRICT TAXES IMPOSED BY

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.209
JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE.

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:15.809
OF THESE ARE --

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:19.146
FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:22.349
SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS A POINT 5%.

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:23.584

SO IF YOU WERE TO PURCHASE

TAXABLE TANGIBLE PERSONAL

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.591

FOR SALES TAX TO APPLY.

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.169
THE LAW REQUIRES BOTH IN STATE

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:44.304

01:40:44.371 --> 01:40:45.839
THE RETAILER AND THE TITLE

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:47.574
PASSES IN THE STATE.

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:50.477
IF THOSE TWO CRITERIA ARE NOT

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.212
MET THEN THEN WE'RE APPLYING USE

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:55.349

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.050
THE SAME RATE AS THE SALES TAX.

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:58.786
THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE THAT I

01:40:58.852 --> 01:41:00.387
THINK IS --

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:02.956
RELEVANT HERE TODAY IS IS.

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:05.159
WITH REGARD THE ALLOCATION OF

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:07.261
THAT. 1% --

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:09.096
BRADLEY BURNS TAX.

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.832
WHICH IN A USE TAX SCENARIO --

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:13.267
GOES INTO A COUNTY WIDE POOL

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:15.402
WHICH IS THEN ALLOCATED --

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:18.806
ACCORDING --

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:20.541
TO THE SALES TAX --

01:41:20.607 --> 01:41:21.575
ALLOCATION RATES WITHIN THAT.

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:23.677
WITHIN THAT COUNTY --

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.712
TODAY I'M TALKING ABOUT USE TAX

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:26.947
BECAUSE POST WAY FAIR.

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:27.915
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLINE

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.683
RETAILERS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:31.151
PRESENCE IN THE STATE SO BY

01:41:31.218 --> 01:41:32.085
DEFINITION.

01:41:32.152 --> 01:41:34.455
THESE ARE RETAILERS WITHOUT IN

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:35.756
STATE PARTICIPATION IN SALE.

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:37.257
IN THERE'S ONE FOR THE POINT I

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:38.425
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:39.693
POINT OUT TODAY.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.196
ALL OF THE TAX IN IT AND THIS IS

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:44.531
I THINK CAN'T BE STRESSED ENOUGH

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:45.833
ALL THE TAX WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:41:45.899 --> 01:41:48.469
IS ALREADY DO.

01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:50.671
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:54.174
NOT CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:57.444
ARE REQUIRED TO DECLARE AND KEEP

01:41:57.511 --> 01:41:59.179
TRACK OF AND REMIT THAT TAX THE

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.714
STATE THEMSELVES.

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:03.517
OR AS HAPPENS IN WITH ALL OTHER

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:05.118
TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU USED TO

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.987
WHETHER THE RETAILER.

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:08.655
WILL -- HAS

01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:11.825

COLLECT AND REMIT THE TAX --

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:17.130
SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T EMPHASIZE

01:42:17.197 --> 01:42:18.298
THAT ENOUGH THINK IT'S RULING

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:21.869
PARTY KEEP THAT MIND MISTER

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.170

MENTIONED ARE REALLY BIG.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.011
RIGHT DO THEY EVEN KNOW THAT

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:31.645
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:33.213
REMAIN AT IN RIGHT NOW NOT

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.349
TECHNICALLY THE THE RETAILER THE

RETAILERS TO IT THESE DECISIONS

01:42:38.252 --> 01:42:40.687
HAVE TO BE MADE --

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:43.891
IN IN IMPLEMENTED I IS MORE OF A

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:45.325
CHALLENGE THAN JUST SAYING THAT

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:47.160
IT'S THEIR DO IT IS ALTHOUGH I

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.695
DO THINK IN AND WE'LL GET TO

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:50.531
THIS AND I I APPRECIATE THE

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:50.764
COMMENT.

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.165
I DO THINK.

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:54.134
IN A IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATION

01:42:54.201 --> 01:42:55.569
THAT I'VE HEARD IN IN SITTING IN

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.070
THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS.

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.439
WE ARE.

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:01.275
OVER PLAYING I THINK TO SOME

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:03.010
EXTENT.

01:43:03.076 --> 01:43:05.345
THE SMALL BUSINESS ANGLE HERE

01:43:05.412 --> 01:43:07.281
AND I CAME HERE FROM THE SMALL

01:43:07.347 --> 01:43:08.715
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION I'M.

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.018
VERY FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF

01:43:11.084 --> 01:43:12.019
ALL THIS ON SMALL BUSINESS.

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:13.387
BUT IT.

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.955
OUR RESEARCH TELLS US THEIR

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:18.592
PROXIMALLY 80% OF ONLINE SALES.

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:21.261
COME FROM 2% OF RETAILERS.

01:43:21.328 --> 01:43:23.163
WE HAVE SOME VERY LARGE

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:25.866
RETAILERS.

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:26.667
WHO ARE AMONG THE MOST

01:43:26.733 --> 01:43:28.936
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:31.772
COMPANIES ON EARTH?

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:36.410
WHO ARE NOT --

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.911
COLLECTING AND REMITTING USE TAX

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:38.211
[inaudible]

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:39.980
SO.

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:41.949
IF WE CAN BRING THOSE VERY

01:43:42.015 --> 01:43:43.183
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:44.785
COMPANIES INTO COMPLIANCE WE

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.420
WILL GO A VERY LONG WAY TO

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:48.055
CLOSING THE TAX CAP.

01:43:48.121 --> 01:43:49.923
NOW CERTAINLY THERE ARE SMALLER

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:52.059
RETAILERS ALSO --

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.927
WHO MAY BE IMPACTED BY THIS BUT?

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:58.865
I I THINK IF WE FOCUS SOLELY ON

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:00.434
SMALL RETAILERS WHO MIGHT HAVE

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.369
TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS WE MAY

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:02.970
BE MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:06.540
TREES --

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:09.376
ANYWAY IF I COULD BRING IN --

01:44:09.443 --> 01:44:10.777
TALK A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:12.346
ALREADY BEEN DOING SO EVEN PRIOR

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:13.814
TO WAY FAIR.

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.882
RETAILERS WHO HAVE --

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:17.417
PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE.

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:20.053
WERE REQUIRED --

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.688
TO COLLECT AND REMIT USE TAXES

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:21.989
[inaudible]

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:24.191
IT.

01:44:24.257 --> 01:44:25.392
HAS BEEN APPARENT THAT MANY

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:26.994
RETAILERS.

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.563
WITH PHYSICAL PRESENCE --

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.298
HAVE NOT BEEN LIVING UP TO THAT

01:44:31.365 --> 01:44:33.233
OBLIGATION.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.334
MANY OF THESE RETAILERS HAVE

01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.068
PHYSICAL PRESENCE THROUGH

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.837
WAREHOUSING OF GOODS IN THE

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.572

SO AT CD TFA WE'VE OVER THE PAST

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:45.812

01:44:57.357 --> 01:45:00.460
IDENTIFY THOSE RETAILERS.

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:02.129
WE CONTACTED MORE THAN TWENTY

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:04.264
FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM --

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:06.867
IN THE PAST YEAR.

01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:09.903
WE'VE OF PERMITTED --

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.104
SOME HUNDREDS OF THEM AND I

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.339
THINK IN THAT EFFORT.

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:13.874
WE'VE COLLECTED ABOUT SIXTY NINE

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:15.542

PRESENCE WE WILL CONTINUE THAT

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:37.464
EFFORT -- I

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:38.331
EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE

01:45:38.398 --> 01:45:43.603
CONTACTING MANY MORE RETAILERS --

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:44.771

THE DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.039
HOW MANY COMPANIES THAT?

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:20.707
ARE HOW MANY BUSINESSES BECAUSE

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:21.441
LIKE YOU SAID YOU'RE ONLY

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:22.876
TALKING ABOUT REALLY 2% OF THE

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:24.978
COMPANIES WOULD FALL UNDER OR

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:27.881
ABOVE UNDER THAT ABOVE THAT FIVE

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:30.217
HUNDRED THOUSAND OR UNDER THE

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:30.751
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUR

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:31.017
THRESHOLD.

I DON'T.

01:46:33.019 --> 01:46:34.154
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT I

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:35.388
HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER

01:46:35.455 --> 01:46:37.390

HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED

01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:43.530
THOUSAND AND I THINK THE

01:46:43.597 --> 01:46:45.899
DIFFERENCE IN REVENUES OF ABOUT

01:46:45.966 --> 01:46:51.738
5%.FOR THAT SO IT'S IT'S A NAY --

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:53.907
YOU KNOW THAT TO GO TO A LARGER

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:56.309
INCOME IT BECAUSE THE VAST BULK

01:46:56.376 --> 01:46:58.111
OF THE SALES WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:46:58.178 --> 01:47:00.113
ARE REALLY FROM SOME GIANT.

ALAN AND ELLIE OF WAYFAIR CAME

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.791
ALONG -- IN

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.492
LATE JUNE OF THIS YEAR --

WITH SPRING COURT DECISION.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:17.597
AND EVEN BEFORE THE DECISION

01:47:17.664 --> 01:47:18.165
CAME OUT WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:47:18.231 --> 01:47:19.499
POSSIBLE.

01:47:19.566 --> 01:47:21.434
HOW WOULD INTERACT WITH --

01:47:21.501 --> 01:47:24.304
THE STATE'S LONG ARM PROVISION.

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.338
HELLO.

01:47:25.405 --> 01:47:28.375
IN A REVENUE TAXATION CODE

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:30.210
SECTION SIXTY TWO OH THREE

01:47:30.277 --> 01:47:30.944
SUBDIVISION SEE.

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.712
WHICH EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.014
THE TERM RETAILING CATION

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.882
BUSINESS IN THE STATE MEANS ANY

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:37.350
RETAILER THAT HAS SUBSTANTIAL

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:39.419
NEXUS WITH THE STATE. FOR

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:40.654
PURPOSES OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:43.924
U. S. CONSTITUTION --

01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.958
AND ANY RETAILER PAWN HIM

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:46.560
FEDERAL LAW PERMITS THE STATE TO

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.829
IMPOSE THE USE TAX COLLECTION

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:50.163
DUTIES SO BASICALLY.

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:52.232
OUR JURISDICTION EXTENDS AS FAR

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:55.168
AS CONGRESS AND THE CONSTITUTION

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:56.670
PERMITS --

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.104
AND AS YOU'VE ALSO HEARD THOUGH

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.773
THE CORDON WAY FAIR DIDN'T

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:02.008
PROVIDE DEFINITIVE GUIDANCE AS

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.109
TO WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS AND

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:03.710
SO.

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:05.946
WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:10.417
DOING A LOT OF LEGAL RESEARCH --

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:13.153
AND IT IS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VERY

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:13.787
COMPLICATED I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:14.721
I'VE SEEN.

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:16.223
NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA TEXAS

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.791
FLORIDA NEW YORK AND SOME OTHER

01:48:17.858 --> 01:48:18.825
BIG STATES --

01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:22.395
HOLD BACK --

01:48:22.462 --> 01:48:24.164
IN ANY EVENT --

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.267
WE ALSO DO THEY'LL REALIZE THAT

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.102
WE ARE AND NEED TO MOVE FORWARD

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:34.007
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS --

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:35.575
PAST THIS LONG ARM STATUTES FOR

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:39.546
EXACTLY THIS EVENTUALITY --

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:40.614
BUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.382
NEED TO ANSWER AND AMONG THEM

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.750
ARE WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:45.919
THRESHOLDS AS YOU'VE HEARD --

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:47.854
WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON IT IN

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:50.056
STATE SELLERS WHICH IS --

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:51.591
ONE OF THE QUIRKY THINGS OF OUR

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.792
CODE THAT HASN'T COME UP IN

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.427
TODAY'S HEARING BUT WHATEVER WE

01:48:54.494 --> 01:48:56.396
DO WILL IMPACT --

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:57.864
IN STATE SELLERS AS WELL.

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.033
OF WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT OUT

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.902
OF STATE COLLECTION PROCESS --

01:49:01.968 --> 01:49:04.871
WHEN WILL THE OBLIGATION BEGAN --

01:49:04.938 --> 01:49:06.306
HOW LONG WILL BUSINESSES HAVE TO

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.341

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:10.710
HOW WILL LOCAL DISTRICT TAXES BE

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:12.045

THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND

THE RISK OF LITIGATION ARE JUST

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.249
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS.

SCHEDULED.

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:41.174
A STAKEHOLDER MEETING FOR NEXT

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:44.511

WELL WE DON'T AND WHAT WE DON'T

01:49:52.686 --> 01:49:55.155
KNOW WHAT THE FULL CONTOUR IS OF

01:49:55.221 --> 01:49:56.957
IMPLEMENTATION LOOK LIKE ONE

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:58.792
THING I DO WANT TO STRESS TO

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:00.393
ANYBODY LISTENING --

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.328
WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:02.729
IMPOSING ANY RETROACTIVE

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.631
LIABILITY WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:06.166
PERSPECTIVE --

01:50:06.232 --> 01:50:08.335
SOLUTIONS TO THIS SO.

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:10.036
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:11.037
OFTEN SO I WANNA MAKE SURE

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:13.740
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT --

01:50:13.807 --> 01:50:16.276
WE DO EXPECT THAT WE WILL --

01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:19.579
ISSUE A NOTICE SOMETIME --

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:22.415
BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. TO

01:50:22.482 --> 01:50:25.852
BUSINESSES INFORMING THEM OF

01:50:25.919 --> 01:50:28.755
THERE NEED TO COMPLY WITH.

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:31.358
A SIXTY TWO OH THREE WITH WITH

01:50:31.424 --> 01:50:33.159
CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAWS.

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.862
AND WE EXPECTED SOMETIME IN THE

01:50:35.929 --> 01:50:36.730
FIRST.

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:39.099
HALF BURKE FIRST PART OF TWENTY

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:40.367
NINETEEN THAT --

01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:42.402
THAT.

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:43.636
THAT NOTICE WOULD A REQUIRE

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:46.740
COMPLIANCE --

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:48.208
A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:51.144
IT'S WORTH MENTIONING --

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.646
AS WE LOOK AT REVENUE AND AND

01:50:53.713 --> 01:50:55.448
WHOSE IMPACTED --

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:57.183
AS I MENTIONED YOU COMMERCE

01:50:57.250 --> 01:51:01.621
SALES VERY CONCENTRATED --

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.189
SECOND -- IN

01:51:03.256 --> 01:51:03.790
THERE WITH THIS WAS MENTIONED

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:04.691
EARLIER.

01:51:04.758 --> 01:51:05.425
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A VERY

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.559
DIFFERENT SLICE THE MARKET

01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:08.628
BETWEEN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS --

01:51:08.695 --> 01:51:10.363
TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS TO

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.098
CONSUMERTRANSACTIONS I THINK WE

01:51:12.165 --> 01:51:13.867
OFTEN THINK OF THE BUSINESS TO

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.235
CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:16.703
MOST OF US HERE ARE.

01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:18.038
THAT'S HOW WE INTERFACE WITH

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.606
ONLINE RETAIL.

01:51:19.672 --> 01:51:22.842
BUT ACTUALLY THE BULK OF ONLINE

01:51:22.909 --> 01:51:26.446
RETAILERS BUSINESS TO BUSINESS --

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.348
A HUGE PERCENTAGE THAT THOUGH IS

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:30.150
OUR SALES FOR RESALE SO THEY'RE

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:31.851
NOT SUBJECT TO TAX.

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:34.354
A AND ALSO I THINK COMPLIANCE

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:35.388
APPEARS TO BE HIGHER IN THE B.

01:51:35.455 --> 01:51:37.791
TO B. SEGMENT --

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:39.993
PERHAPS BECAUSE WE ALSO --

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:42.062
IN FORCE USED TAX LAWS WHEN WE

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:45.265
DO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE --

01:51:45.331 --> 01:51:47.500
SO WE'RE CHECKING USE TAX

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:49.436
LIABILITY --

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:50.804
FOR THOSE TAXPAYERS THAT ARE

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:54.140
ALREADY PERMITTED BY CD TFA --

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.142
IN THE BUSINESS TO CONSUMER

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:57.777
WHAT'S A SMALLER SEGMENT OF THE

01:51:57.844 --> 01:51:59.946
MARKET THE COMPLIANCE RATES.

01:52:00.013 --> 01:52:00.947
ARE.

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.182
MUCH WORSE [inaudible]

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:06.486
SO -- AND

01:52:06.553 --> 01:52:07.620
LASTLY IN THIS CAME UP --

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:09.656
BEFORE AS WELL.

01:52:09.722 --> 01:52:11.691
THE IT COMPLYING --

01:52:11.758 --> 01:52:13.393
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.761
OF THE STATE WILL BE MORE

01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:15.929
COMPLICATED WE'RE WE RECOGNIZE

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:18.298
THAT -- CDFA

01:52:18.364 --> 01:52:20.633
DOES HAVE FOUR OFFICES.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:23.069
DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO OUT OF

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:25.905
STATE RETAILERS.

01:52:25.972 --> 01:52:26.940
WE HAVE ONE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:28.675
IS CALLED NOW TO STATE OFFICE

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:30.310
WHICH IS CONFUSING.

01:52:30.376 --> 01:52:31.511
THAT DEALS WITH THE WESTERN

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:32.545
UNITED STATES BUT THEN WE HAVE

01:52:32.612 --> 01:52:35.048
OFFICES IN HOUSTON CHICAGO.

01:52:35.115 --> 01:52:36.916
NEW YORK AS WELL THAT FOCUS

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:41.154
SOLELY ON ENFORCEMENT.

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:42.622
OF FOR OUT OF STATE RETAILERS SO.

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:43.857
THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE USED TO

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.291
WE HAVE A MILLION TAXPAYERS

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:46.259
ALREADY.

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:47.894
IN OUR SYSTEM.

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.662
I THINK WE CAN HANDLE WHATEVER

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:51.464
ADDITIONAL WORK IT IS BUT BUT IT

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.533
IS MORE COMPLICATED AND CAN BE

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.468
MORE TIME CONSUMING.

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:57.170
I WITHOUT A SERVICE HOURS SO

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:58.371
WITH THAT THOSE ARE FEW THE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.206
ISSUES I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL

01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:02.475
AND I LOOK FOR TO ANY QUESTIONS

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:07.580

[inaudible]

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:19.886
WELL. TO VIEW MY CERTAIN SURE

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.688
HAPPENS SO IF.

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:23.056
THE REGISTRATION PIECES

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:24.924
RELATIVELY EASY --

YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE AN ONLINE

01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:28.094

COMPLICATED I'VE.

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:31.130
GONE THROUGH IT MYSELF NOT AS A

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:34.834
BUSINESS OWNER BUT AS A HAS A

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:36.436
TWO MEMBER THEIR CD TFA USE

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.037
WANTS TO TEST OUT THE NEW

01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:39.472
COMPUTER SYSTEM NOT THAT PARTS.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:42.575
NOT DIFFICULT --

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:45.745
THE AUDIT PROCESS TYPICALLY.

01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:50.583
A AGAIN UNLESS WE SEE REAL

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:52.352
IRREGULARITIES OR REAL RED FLAGS

01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:54.020
RAISED.

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.455
THE AUDIT PROCESS TYPICALLY

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.290
DOESN'T BEGIN TO LET'S SAY THREE

01:54:57.357 --> 01:55:01.261
YEARS INTO A REGISTRATION CYCLE --

01:55:01.327 --> 01:55:02.595
FOR ANYBODY LISTENING I DON'T

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:05.865
WANT TO THANK YOU CAN --

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:07.533
NOT COMPLY FOR THREE YEARS

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.402
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS --

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:11.504
SINCE WE DO GO BACK EIGHT YEARS

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:14.841
OFTEN AND OUR AUDITS --

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.943
SO I THINK.

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:17.944
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEGINNING PART

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:19.479
WOULD BE A MATTER OF GETTING

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:21.581
REGISTRATION AND GETTING PEOPLE

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:22.849
INTO THE SYSTEM --

01:55:22.915 --> 01:55:24.117
WE DO A LOT OF OUR REGION

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.885
EDUCATION I THINK THAT'S SORT OF

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:28.121
HOW WE WOULD --

01:55:28.187 --> 01:55:29.656
FOCUS.

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:32.325
OUR EFFORTS SIDE TO TRY.

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:33.926
TO BRING VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE

01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:35.561
WHICH IS REALLY THE CHEAPEST

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:36.929
MONEY WE CAN BRING INTO THE

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.765
SYSTEM BECAUSE COLLECTIONS

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.767
EFFORTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AUDIT

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.168
IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE SO.

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:44.637
OUR FOCUS IS REALLY ON HELPING

01:55:44.704 --> 01:55:46.439
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COMPLY --

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:49.175
VOLUNTARILY [inaudible]

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:57.350
I THINK. FOR THE LARGE FOLKS --

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:58.584
I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE VERY

01:55:58.651 --> 01:56:00.253
DIFFICULT I THINK IN THE PAST

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.455
YOU'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE PROTEST

01:56:02.522 --> 01:56:03.189
THAT.

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:05.658
THERE IS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:07.260
WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT HOW

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:08.761
COULD WE POSSIBLY DO IT AND THEN

AND IT'S IT CAME UP BEFORE WITH

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:07.720
REGARD TO STREAMLINED.

HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS OR

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:17.316

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:38.370
WITH.

02:04:38.437 --> 02:04:39.705
JUST HAD A NO NAME THINKING

MANAGER OF ARENA SO WHAT ARE

02:04:40.406 --> 02:04:41.574
THEY SUPPOSED TO COMPLY WITH AND

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:43.075
WHAT IS THE STANDARD WHICH AT

02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:44.677
THE THRESHOLD CAN HIT SO WHAT

02:04:50.850 --> 02:04:51.517
JUDGE.

02:04:51.584 --> 02:04:53.018
I THINK --

02:04:53.085 --> 02:04:55.387
AS PROFESSOR ALAN MENTIONED IT'S

02:04:55.454 --> 02:04:56.722
RELATIVELY COMPLICATED BECAUSE

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:59.859
CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF

02:04:59.925 --> 02:05:02.294
THOSE --

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:03.796
SAME IT DOES HAVE EXACT SAME

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:05.631
STRUCTURE AS SOUTH DAKOTA.

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:08.133
I THINK --

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.102
OUR LEGAL TEAMS I THINK IT'S

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:13.706
FAIR TO SAY OUR LEGAL TEAMS --

02:05:13.772 --> 02:05:15.507
GOING INTO THE STAKEHOLDER

02:05:15.574 --> 02:05:17.409
MEETING BELIEVES THAT --

02:05:17.476 --> 02:05:19.011
THAT WE WOULD BE ON SOLID GROUND

02:05:19.078 --> 02:05:21.146
WITH A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:24.650
HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS BUT WHETHER

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:27.119
THAT ALTERNATELY IS THE STANDARD.

02:05:27.186 --> 02:05:29.989
IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAS NOT YET

02:05:30.055 --> 02:05:31.390
BEEN DETERMINED AND WE ARE OPEN

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:33.425
TO CONSIDERING.

02:05:33.492 --> 02:05:34.894
AND THAT'S THAT THE PEACE IN ANY

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:37.463
DON'T EVERYONE PUT WORDS INTO

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:38.464
THE CHAIRMAN'S AMOUNT SO --

02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:39.465
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS

02:05:39.531 --> 02:05:40.599
LEGISLATION IT'S ADVANCE IT

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:42.001
CREATES A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:44.703
THAT WOULD OF COURSE OUR OUR

02:05:44.770 --> 02:05:46.171
INTENT IS ONLY --

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.940
TWO IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT YOU

02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:49.308
ALL OF PASSED THE LEGISLATURE

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:50.843
DID PASS THIS LONG ARM STATUTE

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.479
AND NOW WE ARE DOING OUR LEVEL

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:55.247
BEST TO IMPLEMENT.

02:05:55.314 --> 02:05:56.849
THAT LAW SO THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:57.950
JUST WALKING THROUGH THIS AND

02:05:58.017 --> 02:05:59.184
AND THANK YOU FOR PLAYING TWENTY

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:00.986
QUESTIONS WITH US.

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:03.355
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HEY SO

02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:04.189
YOU WOULD GO WITH WHATEVER STATE

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:05.457
WITH THAT THE STANDARD IS IT'S

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:06.825
ON THE BOOKS NOW.

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.961
LET'S JUST SAY THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:10.496
WOULD CHANGE THAT STANDARD.

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:11.964
AND THAT WOULD BE SIGNED INTO

02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:13.299
LAW EVEN WITH AN URGENCY

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:16.335
SOMETIME LATER IN.

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:16.969
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YOU WOULD

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:19.271
COLLECT A PART OF THE YEAR.

02:06:19.338 --> 02:06:21.674
AT LET'S JUST SAY THE HUNDRED

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.374
THOUSAND STANDARD.

02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:24.143
AND IF THE LEGISLATURE SAID WE

02:06:24.209 --> 02:06:25.344
WANTED TO GET A COLLECTED A TWO

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:26.679
OR THOUSANDS ARE STANDARD THAT

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:28.113
WOULD THEN BE PRO RATED FOR THE

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.048
REMAINDER OF THE YEAR I'M JUST

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:29.648
TRYING.

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:30.616
TO DETERMINE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:34.253
SENDING OUT A LETTER.

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.154
HEAVY DUTY.

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.221
AFTER YOUR STAKEHOLDER MEAN

02:06:36.288 --> 02:06:37.589
YOU'RE GONNA DETERMINE THRESHOLD.

02:06:37.656 --> 02:06:39.024
AND THEN THAT SPECIAL CHANGES BY

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.626
THE LEGISLATURE --

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:42.161
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:43.529
THIS WORKS AND HOW WE CAN BE

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.764
CLEAR WITH THE MARKET PLACE AND

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:46.265
I JUST WANNA ADD TO THAT

02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:47.933
QUESTION CENTURY ANSWERING MOST

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:48.701
OF IT.

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.069
AND I JUST HAVE A LITTLE OUT ON

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:53.605
IS IS THE URGENCY TO PUT THE

02:06:53.672 --> 02:06:56.108
NOTICE OUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:57.343
THAT WE WOULD BE COLLECTING WHAT

02:06:57.409 --> 02:07:02.481
IS THE URGENCY BEFORE. TO BUT

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:04.450
THE NOTICE OUT ARE OR THE I

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:05.284
THINK ON OUR URGENCY IS SIMPLY

02:07:05.351 --> 02:07:08.354
THE THAT THERE IS A STATUTE ON

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:09.254
THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:07:09.321 --> 02:07:12.624
AND MY JOB.

02:07:12.691 --> 02:07:16.528
AS I SEE IT IS TO EMPLOYMENT.

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:17.763
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:22.001
CALIFORNIA AND BUT THAT'S THAT'S

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.703
THE EXTENT OF OF MY URGENCY.

02:07:24.770 --> 02:07:26.338
IN ALL SAY IN THIS IS MORE OF AN

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:28.007
EDITORIAL THAN A QUESTION WOULD

02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:30.576
BE IS THAT.

02:07:30.642 --> 02:07:31.777
ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE RIGHT ANY TO

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:32.978
BE A TO CARRY THROUGH DISCREET

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:35.147
AN AWKWARD DYNAMIC --

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:35.914
I THINK THERE'S TWO ROUTES

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:37.816
THAT'S COULD BE IMPLEMENTED THIS

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:38.484
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A BUDGET

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:39.852
BILL -- IT

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:40.853
THROUGH THE MINISTRATION OR THIS

02:07:40.919 --> 02:07:42.554
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH

02:07:42.621 --> 02:07:44.123
LEGISLATION UNDERSTAND AS WE

02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:45.724
HEARD FROM PROFESSOR MANY STATES

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:47.259
ARE CHOOSING LEGISLATIVE ROUTE.

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:48.627
SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO BE TO GO

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:50.295
WITH THE STANDARD HERE BY THE

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:51.697
END OF THE YEAR INTEL RETAILERS

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:53.232
ARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO COMPLY

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:54.266
TO X. STANDARD.

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:55.868
IN THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES BE

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:57.770
ABLE TO ADVANCE LEGISLATION AND

02:07:57.836 --> 02:07:59.138
A DIFFERENT STANDARD IT CREATES.

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.672
SOME LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES IN

02:08:00.739 --> 02:08:03.108
SINGLE CONFUSION SO I'LL ALL I

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:06.378
WOULD SAY IS I THINK NUMBER ONE

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:06.879
I THINK WE NEED TO BE TO

02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:08.180
DETERMINE.

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:08.814
AND CAN NEVER TELL THE

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:09.448
ADMINISTRATION WHAT TO DO SO I

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:10.883
TOTALLY GET IT WHAT THE ROUTE IS

02:08:10.949 --> 02:08:12.317
GONNA BE TAKEN --

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:15.220
AND WHAT THAT STANDARD IS TO NO

02:08:15.287 --> 02:08:16.288
ONE SO THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:17.723
OF CONFUSION OUT --

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:19.224
IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT'S THOSE

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:21.193
CONCERNS ARE CERTAINLY ON OUR

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.795
MINDS AS WELL WHICH IS ONE OF

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.296
THE REASONS WHY.

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:27.166
YOU KNOW NOT TO WE DID NOT WANT

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:27.733
TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS BUT WE IN

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:28.901
FACT.

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:30.269
LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE

02:08:30.335 --> 02:08:32.838
LOOKING AT THE CORE DECISION --

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:35.007
OUR TEAM --

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.442
PUT DOWN SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:38.710
WE THOUGHT LEGISLATION MIGHT.

02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:42.214
IN FACT LOOK LIKE AND YOU KNOW

02:08:42.281 --> 02:08:43.882
IN IN.

02:08:43.949 --> 02:08:46.251
WHY I THINK OUR OUR THOUGHTS

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:48.654
WERE IF WE WERE LEGISLATING A

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.022
NEW SYSTEM?

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:51.890
THAT WE WOULD.

02:08:51.957 --> 02:08:53.125
HAVE A HIGHER THRESHOLD

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:54.893
SATISFIED HAVE AND THEN NOT HAVE

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.895
A A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:57.729
WE WOULD HAVE.

02:08:57.796 --> 02:08:59.298
I THINK A MARKET PLACE PROVISION

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:00.399
WHICH I THINK WOULD.

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:02.568
WOULD MAKE TAX ADMINISTRATION

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:06.271
MUCH EASIER --

02:09:06.338 --> 02:09:07.940
IN FACT THAT IS ONE OF THE

02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:09.308
THINGS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:11.443
PURPOSEFULLY.

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:14.847
WAITED A BIT ODD TO SEE WHETHER

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:15.347
THAT MIGHT.

02:09:15.414 --> 02:09:16.381
OCCUR.

02:09:16.448 --> 02:09:18.517
LET ME HELP YOU SO WE SPOKE AT

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:20.152
THE END OF LAST YEAR AND THERE

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:22.521
WAS A DESIRE I THINK AMONG SOME

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.289
TO TRY DID HANDLE THIS AS

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:25.891
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER.

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.392
THERE WERE THE OVER ARCHING

02:09:27.459 --> 02:09:28.827
DESIRE WAS NOT THERE TO GET IT

02:09:28.894 --> 02:09:30.729
DONE THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:34.233
BILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:35.501
HOWEVER THAT IS WHY I ASK THE

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:36.635
QUESTION IS THE I'M TRYING TO

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:38.971
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PUSH IS NOW

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:41.206
IF IT'S FROM CD TFA IF IT IS

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:42.574

THIS DECISION JUST CAME IN I

IS.

02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:56.889
HEY I HAS TO TO RAISE BECAUSE IT

02:09:57.623 --> 02:09:58.857
BUT IN FACT YOU KNOW --

02:09:58.924 --> 02:10:00.893
RIGHT AFTER THE DECISION RIGHT

CHEST PAGE PUT UP ON OUR WEBSITE

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:07.666
WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD.

02:10:07.733 --> 02:10:11.837
A NOTICE THAT HAD A VERY SPAN

PERIOD -- SO

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.909
THIS IS BEEN FROM THE GET GO I'M

02:10:16.975 --> 02:10:18.677
WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:20.812
ENFORCE THE LAW SERIOUSLY AND

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:23.215
THAT'S THIS IS BEEN SINCE JUNE

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:24.883
SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:26.318
CAME OUT IN JUNE --

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.452
ON THE WEBSITE.

02:10:27.519 --> 02:10:28.720
AND THEN WAS PULLED BACK OFF THE

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:30.389
WEBSITE AND SO WE HAVE SO THIS

02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:31.823
CONVERSATION HAS BEEN GOING ON

02:10:31.890 --> 02:10:32.958
FOR A BIT HOWEVER THAT'S WHAT

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:34.092
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

02:10:34.159 --> 02:10:35.360
REST BECAUSE THEY DO.

02:10:35.427 --> 02:10:36.828
SHARE YOUR CONCERNS AND WE SHARE

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:39.965
THEM WITH NICHOLAS IS THAT --

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.033
IF WHAT'S SOMETHING GOES INTO

02:10:41.099 --> 02:10:42.401
PLACE AND THEN WE DON'T FEEL

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:43.802
IT'S THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.070
WHICH I THINK.

02:10:45.137 --> 02:10:46.572
I THINK A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS

02:10:46.638 --> 02:10:47.806
VERY LOW I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.308
RIVA SAID THAT AS WELL FOR A

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:50.342
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH THE

02:10:50.409 --> 02:10:51.677
AMOUNT OF CONSUMERS WE HAVE AND

02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:53.478
I THINK WITHOUT SMALL MARGIN

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:54.079
THAT YOU.

02:10:54.146 --> 02:10:55.614
LOSE IN REVENUE BETWEEN A

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:56.915
HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:57.783
THOUSAND I THINK THAT WE SEE A

02:10:57.849 --> 02:11:00.252
LOT OF THE BENEFITS ON YOUR SIDE

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:01.753
AND ON OURS.

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:04.556
BUT THAT'S I REALLY TRYING TO

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:06.124
UNDERSTAND I I AM CLASS.

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:07.492
WELL WITH TAX LAW WE HAVE EVERY

02:11:07.559 --> 02:11:08.560
YEAR.

02:11:08.627 --> 02:11:10.495
I I WISH THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:11.863
WERE THIS RETICENT TO CHANGE TAX

02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:13.899
LAW NORMALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:15.567
EVERY YEAR MANY MANY BILLS THAT.

02:11:15.634 --> 02:11:16.668
THAT.

02:11:16.735 --> 02:11:19.238
FIND THEIR WAY TO A TO US WERE --

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:23.709
WE CHANGE TAX ALL I I PERSONALLY

02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:25.244
NOT INCREDIBLY TROUBLED THOUGH I

02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:26.678
I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT

02:11:26.745 --> 02:11:28.814
THE PROSPECT OF IF IF THE

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.315
LEGISLATURE WERE TO CHANGE THE

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:31.683
THE THRESHOLDS.

02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:35.087
AT SOME POINT WE WOULD.

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:39.358
CHANGE THE THRESHOLDS.

02:11:39.424 --> 02:11:40.626
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU HAVE.

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:41.560

ME EARLIER AND WE WENT OVER --

02:11:44.663 --> 02:11:46.431
SO MY CONCERNS --

02:11:46.498 --> 02:11:48.667
I JUST WANT TO REITERATE FOR THE

02:11:48.734 --> 02:11:50.902
GROUP HERE THAT --

02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:53.672
SO FAR OUR COLLECTIVE TAXES ON

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:56.742
MARIJUANA HAS NOT BEEN STERLING --

02:11:56.808 --> 02:11:58.543
IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GO TO YOUR

02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:02.014
LOCAL CORNER DEALER AND GET IT

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.448
435% OFF.

02:12:03.515 --> 02:12:05.150
OF THE STATE PRICE.

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:06.952
THEN IT IS TO GO TO THE

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.553
DIFFERENT DISPENSARIES THAT ARE

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.188
DOING IT LEGALLY AND THAT LEGAL

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:11.757
GROWERS THAT HAVE TO PAY ALL THE

02:12:11.823 --> 02:12:15.694
ACTOR FEES AND TAXES AND PERMITS.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.629
SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS.

02:12:17.696 --> 02:12:18.330
HERE.

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:20.799
IS THE DARK WEB.

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.668
IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF A

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:25.170
MASSIVE ECONOMIC ENGINE.

02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:26.972
ON THE DARK WEB THEY'RE NOT JUST

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:27.973
GET YOUR SOUL SECURITY NUMBER ON

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:29.274
IT THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF

02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:30.409
COMMERCE --

02:12:30.475 --> 02:12:31.943
NOT THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT'S

02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:33.512
THIS I HEAR IT.

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:34.579
I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HE WOULD

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:34.813
PACKARD.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:39.751
SO WHAT. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:42.454
IS AS WE COME OUT OF THE GATE.

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:44.289
UP IT'S LIKE YOU WERE A

02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:46.758
FISHERMAN WITH A NET.

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:47.859
OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.428
PEOPLE GET THEIR TAXES WE WANT

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:50.295
TO CATCH THE FISH [inaudible]

02:12:50.362 --> 02:12:52.731
GOT IT.

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.500
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ALL LOOK

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:56.668
AT MAKING THE NET.

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:59.338
IS BIG AND WIDE AS POSSIBLE WITH

02:12:59.404 --> 02:13:01.673

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.241
LITTLE LITTLE FISH OUT GO AFTER

02:13:03.308 --> 02:13:05.243
THE BIG FISH.

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:07.012
THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE NET DOWN

02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:08.814
THE ROAD QUE.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:12.584
IN TILL IT'S FINALLY WE WE WE WE

02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:13.885
HIT THAT --

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:17.589
BALANCE WHERE IT'S FAIR. TO THE

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:19.791

I DON'T GET IT HALF THE TIME.

02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:25.230
AND THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IF I'M

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:28.400
NOT BEING CHARGED A SALES TAX ON

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.402
TAKEN ON MAYBE YOU KNOW.

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:31.536
ONCE NOT DO SO [inaudible]

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:34.940
QUITE A OFTEN IT'S AN EDUCATION

02:13:35.006 --> 02:13:36.675
THING WHICH I HAVE GREAT

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:37.242
CONFIDENCE YOUR GOING TO BE

AFTER THE BIGGER FISH FIRST

02:13:59.131 --> 02:14:01.366
THAT'S HOW WE EXPAND OUR

02:14:01.433 --> 02:14:03.802
RESOURCES --

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:05.971

I DON'T VIEW AGAIN THIS TAXES

02:14:22.587 --> 02:14:26.525
VIEW THIS AS ANY EFFORT.

02:14:26.591 --> 02:14:27.893
TO PUT FOLKS OUT OF BUSINESS OR

02:14:27.959 --> 02:14:29.161
DRIVE PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:30.195
PAYING THE USE TAX IS GOING TO

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:31.530
DRIVE PEOPLE IN THE BLACK MARKET

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:34.232
I THINK IT'S IT'S SIMPLY.

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:40.505
UNFAIR AND IT'S THE LAW.

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:41.273
THURMOND ARE.

02:14:41.339 --> 02:14:42.140

FOR MEETING WITH ME THIS.

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:47.012
MORNING I I STILL HAVE A FEW.

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:49.047
QUESTIONS A SHORT --

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:51.950
AFTER OUR OUR ROBUST DISCUSSION

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.518
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE IN YOUR OR

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:55.887
DEPARTMENT IS IN ITS INFANCY UP.

02:14:55.954 --> 02:14:57.556
ARE YOU PERMITTED TO ISSUE

02:14:57.622 --> 02:14:59.424
REGULATIONS YES.

02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:01.393
SO CAN YOU START.

02:15:01.460 --> 02:15:02.627
WITH YOUR THRESHOLDS THROUGH

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.162
REGULATIONS AND THEN WAIT FOR

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:06.932
THE LEGISLATION.

02:15:06.998 --> 02:15:09.234
WE COULD I DON'T KNOW THAT OUT.

02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:13.705
OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT HAS ADVISED

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:16.074
THAT THAT'S NOT [inaudible]

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:18.443
NESSA'S NECESSARY GIVEN THE

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:23.615
STATUTE BUT THAT IS WHY.

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:26.485
A POSSIBLE AVENUE FOR PRECEDING.

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:28.353
IT COULD TAKE.

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.621
A YEAR.

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:31.623
REGULATIONS COULD TAKE UP TO A

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:34.392
YEAR -- AS

02:15:34.459 --> 02:15:36.161
WHAT I UNDERSTAND IN.

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:38.997
IT'S NOT A FAST PROCESS MCKAY

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:41.633
THEN OF THE SECOND QUESTION IS --

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.701
GOOD TO COMMENT ON THE

02:15:42.767 --> 02:15:44.569
STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX

02:15:44.636 --> 02:15:46.304
AGREEMENT.

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:48.206
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.408
IT AND SEE IF YOUR THUMBS UP OR

02:15:50.475 --> 02:15:51.877
THUMBS DOWN WELL I THINK THE AS

02:15:51.943 --> 02:15:53.278
I UNDERSTAND IT I THINK THE

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:55.780
LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE DONE A AN

02:15:55.847 --> 02:15:59.651
ANALYSIS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE

02:15:59.718 --> 02:16:00.785
EIGHTEEN OR SO --

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.120
THAT FOUND IT WOULD REQUIRE

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:03.688
HUNDREDS OF CHANGES TO

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:06.057
CALIFORNIA TAX LAW --

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.360
IT WOULD DISALLOW THINGS LIKE OF

02:16:08.426 --> 02:16:10.762
THE PARTIAL EXEMPTIONS THAT --

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:12.697
CALIFORNIA HAS TO PROMOTE

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.666
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT THE

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:17.969
STATE DETERMINES ARE BENEFICIAL --

02:16:18.036 --> 02:16:21.473
SO IT'S IT'S BY.

02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:22.941
PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:25.710
REASONS WHY I BELIEVE.

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:27.712
THERE ARE ASPECTS YOU KNOW IF

02:16:27.779 --> 02:16:28.480
THERE WERE CENTRALIZE

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:29.814
REGISTRATION THAT'S ONE THING I

02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:30.849
KNOW SOME OF THE STATE'S OF

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:32.217
TALKED WITH STREAMLINED ABOUT

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:33.552
JUST USING IT AS A PORTAL SO

02:16:33.618 --> 02:16:34.886
SOMEBODY COULD.

02:16:34.953 --> 02:16:37.289
REGISTER WITH MORE SIMPLY WITH

02:16:37.355 --> 02:16:39.090
ALL THE STATE'S NOT SOMETHING

02:16:39.157 --> 02:16:39.724
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALTHOUGH

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:40.625
WE WOULD HAVE.

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:41.927
TO GIVEN THAT OUR REGISTRATION

02:16:41.993 --> 02:16:43.261
PROCESS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:16:43.328 --> 02:16:44.462
AND REQUIRES SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:16:44.529 --> 02:16:45.730
FORMATION WE WOULD.

HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE SELLERS

02:16:47.165 --> 02:16:48.934
BUT WE COULD AT LEAST IDENTIFY

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:49.501
THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:52.904
THAT'S THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST

02:16:52.971 --> 02:16:54.506
FRUITFUL PATH OF THE MOMENT

02:16:54.573 --> 02:16:56.741
RATHER THAN --

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:59.077

HAPPY TO HAVE OUR OUR TEAM MIND

02:17:13.525 --> 02:17:15.327

02:17:15.393 --> 02:17:17.529
OF INTEREST IN A WELCOME THE

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.163
CHANCE FOR US.

02:17:18.229 --> 02:17:19.364
TO PUT TOGETHER SOME MORE

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:20.665

UNIFORMITY THIS IS.

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:37.649
THIS IS A A PLACE TO FIND IT

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:39.618
WERE WERE ONE SHY OF FALL AFTER

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:41.820
THE STATE'S BEING INVOLVED --

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:43.221
I'M JUST WONDERING --

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:45.957
WITH REGARDS TO THE USE TAX --

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:47.425
THERE'S A LINE ON THE FORM FIVE

02:17:47.492 --> 02:17:48.226
FORTY WERE.

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:49.628
IF YOU HAVEN'T PAID WHEN YOU

02:17:49.694 --> 02:17:50.762
HAVE ONE OF THESE AT ESTATE

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.897
TRANSACTIONS --

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.299
THAT YOU'RE YOU PAY FOR ON YOUR

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:55.634
FORM FIVE FORTY AT HOW'S THAT

02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:56.601
WORKING OUT [inaudible]

02:17:56.668 --> 02:18:00.071
IT -- I

02:18:00.138 --> 02:18:02.273
DON'T HAVE THE LATEST NUMBERS

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:04.542
BUT IT'S NOT A LARGE SOURCE OF

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:05.043
REVENUE FOR THE STATE OF

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.244
CALIFORNIA.

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:09.347
SO THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT.

02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.815
AND AND WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR

02:18:10.882 --> 02:18:12.584
SAY THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY

02:18:12.651 --> 02:18:14.386

02:18:18.823 --> 02:18:20.325
WITH RICK I'M WITH REGARD TO

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:21.626
THIS I MEAN HOW WE DEAL WITH

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:23.428
THAT IN MY MIND IS.

02:18:23.495 --> 02:18:26.364
AS WE DO WITH I MEAN IMAGINE IF.

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:27.832
FOR BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.100
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RETAILER

02:18:29.167 --> 02:18:30.502
COLLECT THE SALES TAX AND WE HAD

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:33.938

02:18:34.005 --> 02:18:35.840
THE CONSUMER.

02:18:35.907 --> 02:18:38.209
SIMILARLY ON THE TAX FORMS NOT

02:18:38.276 --> 02:18:40.445
MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY I WENT OUT

PAY IT SO IN MY MIND.

02:18:53.792 --> 02:18:56.294
WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS TWO

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:57.162
ESPECIALLY NOW THIS IS BRING

02:18:57.228 --> 02:18:58.630
CORD IS SPOKEN SAID THIS IS WHAT

02:18:58.697 --> 02:19:00.298
WE CAN DO --

02:19:00.365 --> 02:19:04.102
IS TO HAVE --

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.504
ONLINE SELLERS REMOTE SELLERS DO

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:10.041
THE EXACT SAME THING THAT WE ASK --

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:10.842
BUSINESSES TO DO AND THAT'S ONE

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:11.910
OF THE OTHER POINTS HERE YOU

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:13.578
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN

02:19:13.645 --> 02:19:15.180
WHICH I GET ABOUT.

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:17.182
YOU KNOW SMALLER SELLERS AND HOW

02:19:17.248 --> 02:19:18.349
COULD THEY POSSIBLY COMPLY

02:19:18.416 --> 02:19:18.650
[inaudible]

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:20.819
EVERY DAY.

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:25.190

THEM I DON'T KNOW. TO ME THAT

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:42.774
IT'S FAIR NOT TO REQUIRE THAT OF%

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:44.309
OTHER PEOPLE --

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:47.912

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:50.148

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:52.150
