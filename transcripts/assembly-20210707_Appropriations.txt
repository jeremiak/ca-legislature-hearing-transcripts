WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH REFORMS WE'RE ALREADY AWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT EXISTS BEFORE RULE CAN BE FINALIZED INCLUDING MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT PROCESS AND THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD REVIEWS THE SCHREYER CAN EXTEND THE RULE MAKING PROCESS BY ONE TO TWO YEARS OR MORE AND IN TURN CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS AT THEIR WORKPLACE. A FURTHER DELAY IN ADOPTING SAFETY STANDARDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL REVIEW THIS MEANS THAT MANY MORE WORKERS ARE AT A PRO LONGED RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH SIMPLY PUT SRI BRINGS LITTLE TO THE WORKER SAFETY RULE MAKING PROCESS OTHER THAN GREATER DELAYS INFLATED STATE COSTS AND MORE INJURIES ILLNESSES.

ANY PROPOSED MAJOR REGULATION SEVERAL STREET AGENCIES STATE AGENCIES ALREADY POSSESS- BENEFIT FROM THIS EXEMPTION. SB FOUR TEN SIMPLY ADDS ONE MORE.
