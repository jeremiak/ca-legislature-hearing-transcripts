AND ACTUALLY IN THE STATE BUDGET TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET BILL CENTER MITCHELL. COLLEAGUES TODAY'S THE BIG DAY. THIS IS AB. SEVENTY FOUR THE ACTUAL BUDGET BILL. IT'S THE SPENDING PLAN FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE SPENDING PLAN THAT IS INFORMED AND FUELED BY AND FUNDED BY ALL OF OUR HARD WORKING CONSTITUENTS. WHO IN TRUST US WITH THE DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY? TO SPEND THEIR MONEY WISELY CAUTIOUSLY INAPPROPRIATELY AND SO I AM PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU AND BRING BEFORE YOU FOR A VOTE TODAY. AB. SEVENTY FOUR IT'S OUR BUDGET BILL FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND IS THE RESULT OF OVER. SEVENTY BUDGET COMMITTEE SUBCOMMITTEE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE HEARINGS OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS AS WELL AS NEGOTIATIONS. WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND ADMINISTRATION. THAT DOCUMENT ACCOUNTS FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF HOURS. BOB DISCUSSION DEBATE COMPROMISED AND ULTIMATELY AGREEMENT. AND I'M PROUD TO STAND BEFORE YOU AS YOUR BUDGET CHAIR TO PRESENT IT TO YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE BUDGET TYPICALLY INCLUDES MULTIPLE BILLS IN TRAILERS. AND SO TODAY WE ARE BUT VOTING ON THE BUDGET BELT IN CHIEF AT NEXT WEEK TRAILER IS AN ADDITIONAL -- BILLS WILL BE BEFORE YOU -- THAT SUPPORT IN AUGMENT. THE OPERATIONS IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES THAT THE BUDGET BILL IN CHIEF DETAILS TODAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA. IT WAS A TIME WHEN -- CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS COULDN'T COUNT ON A JUNE FIFTEENTH BUDGET. AS YOU KNOW WE HAD A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN REQUIREMENTS. WE WERE IN A DEEP DEEP RECESSION. AND CALIFORNIANS HURT AS A RESULT OF THOSE PROTRACTED NEGOTIATIONS I WAS RUNNING A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION AND WE DIDN'T GET ARE PAID OUR CHECKS FROM THE STATE. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WOULD WITHOUT I WAS IN A POSITION AS AN EMPLOYER TO DECIDE IF I TAPPED INTO. THE RESERVES OF MY NONPROFIT TO MAKE PAYROLL OR NOT. FOR MANY OF US REMEMBER THOSE EXPERIENCES WHEN THE STATE WAS IN DEEP RECESSION AND TRAGICALLY WE HAD TO CUT CRITICAL LIFE SUSTAINING. SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WE CUT DEEP INTO QUE FEW TWELVE EDUCATION WE COULD HAVE BILLION DOLLARS OUT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION OUR C. ISSUES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UC'S ARE STILL TRYING TO CATCH UP. FROM THE CUTS THE EXPERIENCE. WE CUT MEDI CAL SO DEEPLY THAT WE LIMITED THE NUMBER OF DOCTOR VISITS A MEDICARE RECIPIENT COULD HAVE PER MONTH. WE ELIMINATED LIFE SUSTAINING AND SAVING SERVICES. WHAT COLLEAGUES I STAND HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SAY WE ARE NO LONGER IN THAT SPACE AS A STATE? AND WE ALL SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THE PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE. FOSTERED. WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING FOR THE BUDGET TODAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO. A BUDGET THAT I CAN SAY AS YOU CAST YOUR VOTE TODAY. ALL OF US CAN BE PROUD OF CAN GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS AND BE PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND SAY TODAY WE DID A GOOD THING AS SITTING MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. SO AGAIN TODAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FINAL AGREEMENT. THAT WILL DO. MANY GOOD THINGS BUT HERE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT WILL STRENGTHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION AND SMALL BUSINESS TAX CUTS. BY THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF SCHOOL FUNDING IN STATE HISTORY. WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT WE WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT. SO SOME OF OUR LITTLE OF CALIFORNIANS BY EXPANDING SEATS IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION THE CHILD CARE SECTOR. AND TO OUR FUTURE LEADERS BY INCREASING ENROLLMENT IN C. ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE. WE WILL LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE PROVIDING NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THE SERVICES THEY RENDER FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. WE ARE LOWERING TAXES FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND FINALLY WE DEDICATE AREN'T WE DEDICATE ONGOING FUNDING FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER WITHOUT ANY MIDDLE CLASS TAX INCREASES. FINALLY THE BUDGET DEAL WILL RETAIN THE STATE'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO FISCAL PRUDENCE INSTABILITY. WITH ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS TO RETIRE BUDGETARY DEBT. AND HISTORIC RESERVE LEVELS. WE'VE SET OURSELVES IN THE STATE ON THE PATH. THAT WOULD NOT BEEN ON BEFORE HISTORICALLY WHERE WE WERE VICTIMS OF AN ECONOMY THAT EBBS AND FLOWS. AND THEREFORE STATE INVESTMENT AND SPENDING THAT EBBED AND FLOWED WE NOW HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IMAGINE THAT. WE WILL HELP PROTECT THE GENERAL FUND AND PROTECT THE SERVICES CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS NEEDS. IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE RECESSION. THAT YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF SO AGAIN COLLEAGUES THIS BUDGET IS BOLD [inaudible] AND RESPONSIBLE. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WITHIN THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR PERIOD BEFORE JUNE FIFTEENTH. AND SO NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES ARE ABLE TO BE MADE TO THIS BUDGET. TO MEET THAT REQUIRED DEADLINE SO WE ARE VOTING ON THE BUDGET IN CHIEF TODAY. WE ALL KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS ARE OCCURRING BETWEEN THE THREE PRINCIPAL PARTIES ARE LEADER HERE IN THE SENATE. THE LEADER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE ADMINISTRATION -- BUT I AM CONFIDENT IN THESE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS AND NOW THAT AS WE LOOK AT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE NEXT WEEK. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOW INCOME OR MIDDLE INCOME AND FOR SOME REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT. FROM THE FRUIT OF OUR COLLECTIVE LABOR THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A GENERAL FUND THAT IS HEALTHY. AND REFLECTS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. AS OUR LEADER IS WORKING HARD TO COMPLETE THE FINAL THREE PARTY DEAL I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE BACK HERE VOTED IN THE REST OF THE BUDGET DEAL. THOSE ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILLS VERY VERY SOME SOON. HOWEVER THE WORK TO FINALIZE THE DEAL WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BUT TODAY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO VOTE ON THE BUDGET BILL IN SHE THAT REFLECTS HOURS OF WORK IN DEDICATED SERVICE REFLECTS THE TRUE VALUES REFLECTED IN ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS BY ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WITH THAT COLLEAGUES I ASKED AN I BOTH. OF AB. SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LAYS GENTLEMAN THE SENATE I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENCE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR BUDGET CHAIR OF THE GOOD CENTER OF LOS ANGELES. IT'S A PLEASURE WORKING WITH HER AND STORING THE BUDGET THROUGH THESE LONG AND LABORIOUS HEARINGS AND MONTHS OF DELIBERATIONS. AND THE INTERESTING THING THOUGH OF THIS INSTITUTION IS OFTEN ACCUSED OF SO MUCH PARTISANSHIP. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS YOU REALLY DON'T SEE THAT SO MUCH. MOST OF THE VOTES ARE BI PARTISAN. IN THE DEBATE THE DISCUSSIONS ARE ALL RESPECTFUL AMICABLE. AND THE RESOLUTION [inaudible] ALSO. AND WE NOW ARE APPROACHING THE RESOLUTION. THERE'S MUCH GOOD IN THIS BUDGET. THE YEAR BEGAN WITH A VERY HEALTHY [inaudible] SURPLUS. A RARITY IN CALIFORNIA. THE PRODUCT OF PRUDENCE. BUT THE FORMER LEGISLATURE'S IN. THE FORMER GOVERNOR. THAT WAS ALLOWING US THAT SURPLUS. ASSISTED ALSO BUY SOMETHING THE VOTERS DID. PROPOSITION TWO THE RAINY DAY FUND. WHICH INSURES HELP. AND ABOUT FOR FOR THE FUTURE. THE GOOD IN THIS BUDGET IS. A CONTINUING AND A STANDARD ATTEMPT. TO DEBT RETIRE. MORE MONEY HAS BEEN PUT FORTH FOR THOSE PURPOSES [inaudible] LONG NEEDED. AND IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE SEATED SPIRITUALLY ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THERE ARE RAISING OF TAXES. INCLUDED IN THIS. AND THE BIGGEST DEFICIENCY. IS THE PRECARIOUSNESS AS WE APPROACH THE FUTURE. DURING A PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. WE HAD A TEMPORARY BUDGET SURPLUS I BELIEVE WAS FIFTEEN BILLION. THAT ALL GOT SPENT IN MORE. AND EVEN REPUBLICANS CONTRIBUTED. TO THE DOWNFALL OF THAT PARTICULAR [inaudible] YEARS SPENDING. WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ECONOMY SO OFTEN [inaudible] BLOCK. WE WERE FIFTEEN BILLION AND THEN LATER FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE RED. A HUGE HOLE [inaudible] TO ENCOUNTER. AND TO YET AGAIN. CRAWL OUT OF AND THE SOLUTION CANNOT ALWAYS BE. JUST RAISE TAXES. IN FACT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BUDGET AS WITH OTHERS TROUBLED AGENCIES [inaudible] LIKE DMV [inaudible] AND ARE. I TT PROJECTS WHICH ALWAYS RUN BILLIONS OVER COST. AND NEVER EVEN CLOSE TO BEING ON TIME AND USUALLY STILL DON'T WORK. WELL WE ARE REWARDING THEM WITH MORE MONEY. ANOTHER AGENCY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GET GUNS AWAY FROM DANGEROUS FELONS. HAD BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF MONEY. AND NOTHING HAPPENED. AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS BUDGET TO SEE SOME OF THAT AUTHORITY NOW. RIGHTEOUSLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN DO THE JOB BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY. SO THE ANSWER ALWAYS ISN'T SIMPLY[inaudible] MORE MONEY. BUT TO I FUNDAMENTAL POINT. I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE AN ECONOMIST I STUDY ECONOMY A LOT. BUT I DO BELIEVE AND HAVE SAID FOR YEARS ARE VERY BUDGET IS PRECARIOUSLY [inaudible] BALANCE [inaudible] IN ANOTHER. RECESSION. OF ANY SORT. NOT EVEN ONE AS SEVERE AS THE ONE WE EXPERIENCED A FEW YEARS BACK. AND WE'RE GONNA QUICKLY BE UPSIDE DOWN SO THE CAUTION THAT I PREACHED ALL YEAR IN THIS BUDGET THE LIBERATION USE CARE [inaudible] CON CUIDADO [inaudible] USE CARE. AND BE PRUDENT CONTINUE TO BE PRUDENT. AND DON'T GET ENTHUSED ABOUT BASS BUILDINGS SPENDING. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT DEFICIENCIES IN THE BILL. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. A BASE BUILDING OBLIGATIONS. CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET. THAT I FEAR. BUT TO GET US IN TROUBLE. ANOTHER AS AN ASIDE PHENOMENA THAT I'M STARTING TO SEE MORE REGULARLY AND BILLS AROUND HERE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. BILLS IT SHOULD HAVE APPROPRIATIONS IN THEM OUR PASSING [inaudible] POLICY BILLS. THE CREATE FISCAL OBLIGATIONS BUT THE LANGUAGE STATES THAT THIS WILL BE FUNDED IN FUTURE BUDGETS. OBLIGING FUTURE LEGISLATORS NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM. BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT CREATED A CONSTITUENCY IN AN EXPECTATION. OF SOME BODY OR SOME ENTITY OR SOME PROGRAM. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME MONEY. AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THAT FUTURE BUDGET. THERE WILL BE. DIFFICULTIES OF COURSE. AND THIS BUDGET DOES INDEED. BUILD FUTURE OBLIGATIONS. BUT I BELIEVE ARE OF GREAT CONCERN. ENHANCE MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO VOTE NO ON THE BUDGET. FOR THAT REASON LOOKING FORWARD. AND ONE OF THE GREAT DEFICIENCIES OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TODAY AND THIS ONE IS. ONE WE'RE KIND OF ME NOW MAY FIRST. AND WE DON'T LOOK TO THE FUTURE. WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW? NOT THIS YEAR AND THEN THE OFF YOUR BUDGET BUT WHAT WILL IT MEAN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW AND THIS IS MY CONCERN. AND THAT'S WHY AS FAR AS THIS BUDGET IS CONCERNED. I WILL BE A NO VOTE. AS WE DELIBERATE ON THE TRAILER BILLS. I BELIEVE SOME OF THOSE SO WILL BE OF MERIT. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST QUICKLY RISE. TO ASK FOR ALL VOTE ON THIS ISSUE I WAS ONE OF THOSE LEGISLATIVE WHO WERE HERE. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE IN A MAJOR FINANCIAL CRISIS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFICIT. AND WE CUT TREMENDOUS PROGRAMS AS OUR BUDGET YEAR CLEARLY STATED I WANT TO COMMEND OUR BUDGET YEAR FOR HER GREAT WORK ON THIS -- BUDGET ARE PROTEOME AND ALL THE CONFEREES ARE SUB CHEERS FOR THEIR HARD WORK BECAUSE THIS IS A BUDGET WE ALL SHOULD BE PROUD UP. IT'S ONE THAT RESTORES MANY OF THE CUTS WE MAY TEN YEARS AGO SO THE INCREASE SPENDING IS NOT SPLURGING IT'S RESTORING MANY OF THOSE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS SUCH AS EDUCATION THAT WE STILL. HAVEN'T FULLY FUNDED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE TODAY. SO WE THERE'S PLENTY HERE WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF REGARD WHAT REGARDS A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. BIG A REPUBLICAN IT REGARDS A WAR YOU RESIDE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S BENEFITS FOR ALL OF US WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE NINETY NINE PROBLEMS. BUT THIS BUDGET EIGHT ONE I ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT -- TO BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS AN HONOR TO SERVE ON THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT THE CHAIR OF BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW. HAS DONE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. I ALSO AS A SIDE BAR HAVE TO THINK DOCTOR JANICE CHAO DDS FOR LETTING ME RESCHEDULE MY FIRST ROOT CANAL. SO I WILL FIND OUT SOON WHICH IS MORE ARDUOUS A SERVING ON THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU'RE GETTING A ROOT CANAL BUT REFLECTING RECENTLY ON THE RECENT PASSING OF A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BY THE NAME OF DORIS DAY -- I'VE BEEN HUMMING. ABOUT ONE OF OUR SONGS FOR TRADEMARK SONGS A LOT EVERY MORNING THE THEME I SEEM TO WAKE UP WITH THE WITH THE LYRICS CASE ROSTER ROCK. BUT WHATEVER WILL BE WILL BE THE THE FUTURE IS NOT OURS TO THE CD CASE ROSTER -- WHATEVER WILL BE WILL BE I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THIS FONG OUT OF MY HEAD. BUT WE CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE THAT'S WHY WE USE THE SAY SOMETHING LIKE -- HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY I APPRECIATE THE CENTER FROM TO HIM -- TALKING ABOUT THEIR WORK WILL WE BE SEEING FIVE YEARS FROM NOW. SO AS WE DEAL WITH THE BUDGET IN CHIEF A WHAT DO WE SEE NOW THAT MIGHT GIVE US INDICATIONS OF WHAT IS COMING. UP AHEAD WHAT IS ON THE HORIZON AND WHAT AT LEAST ONE OF MY SEEING THAT WOULD MAKE ME A LITTLE. CONCERNED. WHAT? A HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND PRICES WHICH IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA. CONCERN BUT IT'S A WORLDWIDE CONCERN. BUT RECENTLY HOUSING PRICES HAVE BEEN INCREASING. AT A DECREASING RATE WHICH MEANS WE HOPE WE SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET BUT THEN WE MIGHT. SEE THE OTHER SIDE AS WE HAVE IN PRIOR RECESSIONS. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE. WHICH FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS HAS BEEN A VERY RELIABLE INDICATOR OF AN UPCOMING RECESSION WHETHER IT'S SIX MONTHS AHEAD OR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AHEAD. WE'RE ALSO NOW SEEING MORE TRANSPARENT AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MUNICIPALITIES. THANKS TO A RECENT GAZ BE STATEMENT THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD. NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS FINALLY SAID YOU NEED TO INCLUDE. YOUR RETIREE MEDICAL. OBLIGATIONS ON YOUR BALANCE SHEET. IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT TOOK UNTIL LAST WEEK FOR CALIFORNIA TO FINALLY RELEASED ITS CUT COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT. AND WHEN IT CAME OUT. THE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS THE LIABILITY INCREASED BY FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. OUR PENSION LIABILITIES ON OUR MOST RECENT. FINANCIAL STATEMENT WENT UP TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION IN IN ONE YEAR. THE UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT FOR CALIFORNIA ROSE BY FORTY THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION. TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR GOVERNMENTAL ACTIVITIES THAT'S THE HIGHEST THE STATE HAS EVER SEEN OF A DEFICIT WE ARE THAT FAR IN THE WHOLE. SO IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT THIS BUDGET STARTS THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND. WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE IT'S ZERO RIGHT NOW. BUT THE TOTAL UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT FOR CALIFORNIA SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. ROSE BY TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE THE DEBTS ARE GROWING FIVE TIMES FASTER JUST IN THIS ONE CATEGORY. LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT GREW THEN THIS LAST YEAR BY NINE BILLION DOLLARS. IT'S JUNE THIRTEENTH AND NOT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES. OR ITS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IT'S NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE COMPLETED. THEIR JUNE THIRTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAPPERS. AND SO WHAT NEWS WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR. HAS NOT BEEN VERY ENCOURAGING. WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ALL FIFTY STATES EITHER TO SEE HOW WE COMPARE. BUT THE CAPPERS WE ARE SEEING. ARE TELLING A DISTRUSTING STORY. EVEN WITH A STRONG ECONOMY OUR CITIES COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING. JUST YESTERDAY AND GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE THE CITIES OF EMERYVILLE. AND SCOTTS VALLEY REQUESTED TO RAISE THEIR TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX ABOVE THE 2% MAXIMUM. RESIDENTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE WORRIED ABOUT AN INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY RATES BY THEIR UTILITY P. JEANNIE. THE SENATE BILL NINE A ONE COMMISSION ENCOURAGES ESTABLISHING A LARGE FUND TO PROVIDE A BRAXTON. IN ASSISTING INSURANCE CARRIERS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO VICTIMS OF FUTURE WILDFIRE CONFLAGRATIONS. THE BIG QUESTION IS WHERE WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM SPECIAL OR TALKING THIRTY FORTY MAYBE FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. THIS BUDGET AND THE RELATED BUDGET BILLS WILL RAISE CELLPHONE RATES. IT WILL RAISE STATE DISABILITY RATES FOR PARENTAL LEAVE EXTENSIONS. IT'LL RAISE INCOME TAXES BY CHERRY PICKING TAX CONFORMITY OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THEN ABLE TO AN ABLE TO PAY FOR AND EARNED INCOME. TAX INCREASE FOR MORE REFUNDS. IT'LL. IT'LL RAISE HEALTHCARE COSTS AND MANDATES. WITH THE MANDATE PENALTY TAXES -- AND IT'S LIKE ALL MY GOODNESS FOR JUST WE'RE JUST ADDING MORE TAXES IN YET JUST. EARLIER THIS MONTH THE RESIDENTS. OF A DISTRICT WITH MORE THAN FOUR MILLION RESIDENTS THE LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT VOTED DOWN MEASURE E.. SAYING WE DON'T WANT OTHER TAX IF. YOU'RE NOT MANAGING YOUR MONEY PROPERLY. AND OUR RESIDENTS ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. OR DAYS THEIR GAS TAX RISE AGAIN BY FIVE POINT SIX CENTS ON JULY FIRST. COLLEAGUES WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE WITH PROPOSITION FIFTY FIVE IF I COULD USE THE WORD FORTUNATE. WHICH WAS A TAX INCREASE EXTENSION A PROPOSITION. THIRTY AND WE'VE SEEN VARIOUS IPO ATION SAYS IN SILICON VALLEY. THAT WE'RE ENJOYING. EXTRA REVENUES AND A SURPLUS. AND I'M THANKFUL I AM THANKFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO PUT MORE INTO CALPERS. AND AT THE CAL STIRS TO HELP OUR SCHOOLS BUT WITH A BUMPER CROP. OF BONUS SO TO SPEAK WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO REDUCE OUR DEBTS. HE HAS A GOOD NUMBER IT SHOULD BE HIGHER. COLLEAGUES THE PROVERBIAL WOLVES ARE AT THE DOOR THE LARGEST ASSOCIATION OF STRAPPED SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE SACRAMENTO CITY. OAKLAND UNIFIED SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IN LA UNIFIED ARE ALL STRUGGLING AND COMMUNICATING THAT THEY'RE HAVING EXTREME DIFFICULTIES THEY WILL BE ON OUR PORCH. CITIES THAT HAVE CUT PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES MANY BY 25%. ARE NOW COMING AND ASKING TO RAISE TAXES FOR SALES TAX ABOVE AND BEYOND THE STATE MAXIMUM. AND ELECTRICITY RATE PAYERS. WHO WILL HAVE TO POTENTIALLY FIND A MASSIVE OF FIRE VICTIMS FIND ARE NERVOUS? COUNTIES ARE ALSO BEING STRETCHED AND STRETCHED. NGUYEN WE'RE SAYING IF YOU DON'T. NEGOTIATE PROPERLY WITH YOUR IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES YOU MAY GET A PENALTY. I PURCHASED A LOT IN THIS BUDGET AND IT'S TRAILER BILLS THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT THE BUDGET DOLES OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN PORK. THIS AMOUNT WAS WAS THROWN INTO THE ELEVENTH HOUR. SUNDAY NIGHT IT WAS SO LARGE THAT THAT WE HAD A POOR APPROVED ANOTHER ITEM WHERE WE HAD TO REDUCE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION. TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS NOW IN THE YEARS THAT WE REDUCE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM WE'RE GOING THROUGH A RECESSION AND WE HAVE TO CUT COSTS THAT'S USUALLY WHERE YOU ATTACK FIRST. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A RATHER UNFORTUNATE. INDICTMENT OF THE BUDGET. THE FUTURE IS NOT OURS TO SEE. WE WILL BE JUDGED HOWEVER FOR STEPPING OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW EXPANSION BECAUSE MAYBE SOMEONE IS MAKING THE ECONOMY OF THRIVING PHENOMENON THAT CALIFORNIA'S RATING MAYBE WE ARE AT THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING. THAT WILL BE SURPRISING OR MAYBE WERE AT THE END OF A LONG RUNNING RISING ECONOMY THAT IS AT THE TURNING POINT. FOR RECESSIONARY ADJUSTMENT. WHATEVER WILL BE WILL BE. BUT DID WE REALLY MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISIONS AND SET THE PROPER PRIORITIES IN THIS BUDGET. QUE SERA SERA. I RECOMMEND A NO VOTE. ON AB SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. IT'S NOT PERFECT BUDGET. BUT WE CAN'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. THIS IS A GOOD STRONG BUDGET FOR CALIFORNIA. I DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS -- THOUGH WITH A PART OF THIS BUDGET THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINAL EXPRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN JUST A MINUTE BUT FIRST LET ME. STATE MY UTMOST RESPECT FOR THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND A VERY DIFFICULT JOB THAT THEY DO IN BALANCING ALL THESE COMPETING INTERESTS AND PRIORITIES WITH THE LIMóN AMOUNT OF FUNDS. THANK YOU. N. FOR LEADERSHIP MADAM PRO TEM MADAM BUDGET CHAIR MAJORITY LEADER -- YOU ALSO HAVE MY UTMOST RESPECT AND MY SINCERE APPRECIATION THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. IT'S NO EASY TASK. AND YET YEAR AFTER YEAR THE LEGISLATURE FINISHES WITH A BALANCED BUDGET DELIVERED ON TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S APPROVAL. EVERY CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER DESERVES OUR PRAISE FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND THE TIME AND ENERGY THEY PUT IN. THIS PROJECT THE PROJECT OUR PRODUCT. THIS BUDGET EXPANDS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDING HISTORIC FUNDING LEVELS FOR EDUCATION AS THE BUDGET CHAIR INDICATED PROVIDING FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL UC AND CSU STUDENTS THAT ARE CALIFORNIANS. AND IMPROVES OUR MERCHANT SEE PREPAREDNESS. AND IT ACCOMPLISHES ALL OF THIS WHILE MAINTAINING SOLID RESERVE FUNDS AND PAYING DOWN THE WALL OF DEATH. THE PART THAT I FIND DISAPPOINTING IS THIS BUDGET DOES NOT REFLECT MUCH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND FISCAL PRIORITIES OF OURS SENATE BUDGET SUB. TO COASTAL RESILIENCY WETLAND RESTORATION AND OTHER INTEGRATED CLIMATE ACTION ON MITIGATION AND RESILIENCE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER FUNDED WE'RE SIMPLY ZEROED OUT FROM WHAT WE APPROVED AFTER MONTHS OF HEARING NEGOTIATIONS IN INPUT. NO ONE CAN DOUBT THE NEED FOR A LARGE INVESTMENT IN SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT IS WHY SENATE. BUDGET SET TO APPROVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS FOR OUR FROM OUR GENERAL FUND CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF BEST. BE. TWO HUNDRED THE AMOUNT CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND WOULD HAVE FREED WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO ANY NEW REVENUE ENACTED INTO LAW TO FINANCE THE WATER FUN. INSTEAD THE BUT THE BUDGET SIMPLY TAKES A SIGNIFICANT BLOCK OF MONEY AT THE G. G. R. F. YEAR AFTER YEAR TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF SUBSTANDARD MISMANAGED WATER SYSTEMS WITHOUT GUARANTEES THAT THERE WILL BE WATER DISTRICT CONSOLIDATIONS WATER DISTRICT. CONSERVATION OR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE. WHEN MARK -- LEGISLATION AB THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE TV ONLY USE REVENUES FROM THE OPTIONS OF CAP AND TRADE FOR PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS TO OUR ATMOSPHERE. THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD CALLS ON ALL NATIONS SEVEN NATION STATES CITIES AND COMPANIES THE STEP UP IN SERIOUSLY REDUCE EMISSIONS. IT IS CONCERNING TO ME. THAT THIS BILL PRIORITIZES CAPEN TREAT OPTION REVENUES IN A MANNER THAT FURTHER WEAKENS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUN NOW IT'SNOT THE FIRST TIME. THAT THIS IS HAPPEN -- BUT I'D HOPED IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB MEMBERS FOR OURSELVES FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS AND RESPECT THE INTEGRITY OF AB. THIRTY TWO WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE TRANSFORMATIVE AND NOT TRANSACTIONAL. AND WE NEED TO BE. IN OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT BODE WELL FOR THE FUTURE GINGER F. BUDGETS IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TEACHER R. F. WILL BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE OTHER USES. BUT I WOULD CONSCIOUS BE CAUTIOUS. IN THAT EVERYONE AND STATE THAT EVERYWHERE THE CARS SHOULD NOT BE FINANCED THROUGH THIS FUN. WE HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED YES INSTRUCTED BY THE BY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT OUR WINDOW IS CLOSING AND THAT WE MAY EVEN BE AT A POINT OF NO RETURN. ON PERMANENT IRREVERSIBLE AND CLIMATE CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES VERY SOON. WE NEED TO SHOW RESTRAINT AND WE MUST SHOW CLIMATE AMBITION. AND LIMIT EXPENDITURE SOME PROGRAMS THAT TRULY REDUCE LIMIT EXPENDITURES ONLY THE PROGRAM SEP TRULY REDUCE CO. TWO THE FINANCE WORTHY AND NON CARBON REDUCE AND PROGRAMS WITH MOVIES FARTHER NOT CLOSER TO OUR AMBITIOUS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS THAT WE HAVE SET. FOR TWENTY THIRTY THE NEXUS MUST BE CLEAR UNEQUIVOCAL AND ROBUST BETWEEN PROGRAMS AND CARBON REDUCTION. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK WE ACCOMPLISH THE SENATE. BUDGET SUB TO THIS YEAR MY COLLEAGUES BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC -- WORKED TIRELESSLY AND PUTTING TOGETHER A PLAN THAT WE COULD HONORABLY SAY WAS A TREMENDOUS POSITIVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR OUR COMMUNITY I WANT TO THANK THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND IT SATISFIED THE MANDATE SET FORTH IN OUR CURRENT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AB THIRTY TWO WHICH REQUIRES US TO READ. USE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITH R. G. G. R. F. EXPENDITURES. BUT DESPITE THOSE SERIOUS CONCERNS AND MIGHT THE RESERVATIONS I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS I'VE STATED EARLIER I PURGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SAID A WHITE HOUSE SKI SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. I TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS LANDMARK IN HISTORIC BUDGET. I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE OUR PRO TEM. THE GOVERNOR AND THE SPEAKER. OUR LEADERS WHO HAVE COME TOGETHER ALONG WITH OUR CONFEREES. TO SHAPE. THE HISTORIC BUDGET. NEVER BEFORE HAS CALIFORNIA BEEN ABLE TO PUT SO MUCH IN RESERVE IN ANTICIPATION. OF THAT RAINY DAY. WOULD IT BE A DIP. OR A DROP WE HAVE NINETEEN BILLION. IN RESERVES MORE THAN THE GENERAL FUND OF MANY SMALL STATES AND NATIONS. WE STILL HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS MOVING FORWARD BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRUDENCE. OF THIS SPENDING PLAN IT'S INVESTING. IN PERHAPS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT WE CAN EVER MAKE IN YOUNG PEOPLE. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHERE THE PREDICTORS. OF GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL -- ENDING UP IN OUR PRISONS. IT HAPPENS THERE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE'VE INCREASED THAT INVESTMENT WE'VE INCREASED THE INVESTMENT. TO MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS. WHO ELECTED US TO BE THE STEWARDS OF THEIR HARD EARNED INCOME IN TAXES TO INVEST THAT IN A MANNER THAT BENEFITS? OUR COMMUNITIES OUR CHILDREN ARE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THAT AS A STATE WE WILL NOW BE OFFERING RELIEF TO MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN PROVIDE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. MEMBERS THIS BUDGET THAT WE ARE ABOUT TO PASS [inaudible] SUPPORTS. A STATE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OF CLOSE TO THREE TRILLION DOLLARS. TWO HUNDRED PLUS BILLION TO SUPPORT AN ECONOMY. OF THREE TRILLION DOLLARS MAKING US IF WE WERE IN NATION. THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE PLANET. ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES. IS THE LACK. OF INCOME AND WEALTH DISTRIBUTION IN THIS STATE AND THIS NATION. THIS BUDGET ALSO WORKS TO BRIDGE THAT GAP. BY INVESTING IN THOSE THAT WORK IN OUR FIELDS. THAT WORK IN OUR SERVICE INDUSTRIES [inaudible] THAT. THEY'RE BACK BREAKING LABOR. THEIR TAX CONTRIBUTIONS OUT OF EVERY PAYCHECK. ALSO POSITION THEM TO BE BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BUDGET. FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS FOR CHILDCARE IN FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY THANKING AGAIN OUR LEADERS THE PRO TEM THE SPEAKER. AND ESPECIALLY THE GOVERNOR. FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING. THE CHALLENGES IT OF ACHIEVING SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. MOST OF US HAVE GROWN UP IN COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE TAKE FOR GRANTED THE ABILITY TO TURN ON THE TAP? AND DRINK A GLASS OF CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. BUT CLOSE TO A MILLION CALIFORNIANS. DON'T HAVE THAT BENEFIT DON'T HAVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. IN THIS BUDGET. IS BOLD IN THE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT [inaudible] TO INVEST. NOT IN FIVE YEARS NOT IN TEN YEARS BUT IMMEDIATELY. IN BRINGING RELIEF TO THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COR INHABITED ALSO BY CALIFORNIANS BY HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO IN MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES CAN'T DRINK THE WATER. THEY CAN'T DAYS WITH THE WATER. IN A CAN'T COOK WITH THE WATER. AND SO ON TOP OF LIMITED INCOMES. THEY PURCHASE. BOTTLED WATER EVERY WEEK. SOME STILL PLAYING ALL WATER BILL. FOR WATER THEY CAN'T USE. SO THE LEADERSHIP NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT TO USE OUR BUDGET TO INVEST IN THIS IMMEDIATE RELIEF. I WOULD SUBMIT. IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO SOME WOULD ARGUE IT IS OVERDUE. BUT WE WILL MAKE HISTORY TODAY BY MAKING GOOD ON THAT PROMISE. OF ADDRESSING THE HUMAN RIGHT OF EVERY CALIFORNIA. FOR ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. MEMBERS I URGE YOUR STRONG YOU'RE CONFIDENT IN YOUR PROUD I VOTE. ON AB SEVENTY FOUR OUR BUDGET BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- MEMBERS. I'M PROUD TO STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET BELL I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT MY GOOD FRIENDS MODERATE POINTED OUT THAT ACTUALLY THIS ENTIRE BUDGET REPRESENTS 1% OF OUR STATE GDP. BUT WHAT IMPORTANT 1% IT IS AND AS CHAIR BUDGET SUB THREE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT SOME THE ITEMS. THE PARTICULARLY THAT WERE IN OUR PURVIEW. THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REALLY ADDRESSING BOTH THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE BUT ALSO AND I APPRECIATE THE MY COLLEAGUES TO SAY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. HOW WE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE HOW YOU'RE MAKING? CHOICES THAT WILL HELP US AS OUR ECONOMY NEWS ON AND OUR IS OUR STATE MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FUTURE. CASE ROSS ROCK -- BUT WE CAN PLAN FOR IT AND WE CAN WE SHOULD TAKE Y. STEPS TO ADDRESS THAT. THE WORST OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IN THIS BUDGET -- IN THE REALM OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO HELP THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIAN INVEST IN THE FUTURE. WELL WE HERE AND WE KNOW IN THE LAST ELECTION -- IN THE PP I SEE POLL SHOWS THAT HEALTHCARE WAS A MAJOR ISSUE. PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS RIGHT NOW WE'RE PROVIDING RELIEF IN THIS BUDGET -- WE'RE PROVIDING RELIEF BY ACTUALLY HELPING. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES FAMILIES OF FOUR WITH INCOMES UP 210050% -- AND UP TO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND I SHOULD SAY UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND OF INCOME WILL BE GETTING ASSISTANCE OUT TO HELP PURCHASE INSURANCE ON COVERED CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO GONNA BE TAKING SOME POLY STATUS THE STEPS THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP [inaudible] REDUCE THE THE PROJECTED INCREASE AND IT AND AN INTERESTING IS BY 325% AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE MAKING SMART CHOICES TO HELP REDUCE THE FUTURE SPENDING NOW CERTAINLY AGING WE TALK OFTEN ABOUT THE SILVER TSUNAMI WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN PLANNING FOR AGING THE FACT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE LONG TERM -- SUPPORT SERVICES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. I KNOW THAT HELPING PEOPLE DISABILITIES WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT BOTH NOW YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE BUT CROSS THE BUDGET AND HOPEFULLY IN THE I BELIEVE IN THIS CHAMBER. AND WE ARE PROVIDING INCREASED PAYMENTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT - FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ACTUALLY INVESTING TO IMPROVE OUR CHILD SUPPORT SYSTEM TO BE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR CHILDREN ARE PAYING INTO THAT THE STATE THAT HAVE TO DO AS MUCH OF THAT. WE ALSO ALTHOUGH THIS WAS FROM LAST YEAR -- ONE MAKE NOTE THAT. WE ARE PROVIDING FOOD TO SENIORS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES SOMETHING WE HAD DONE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES A WELL WE INITIATED THAT ACTIVITY LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE SURE THAT HAPPENS. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTES THAT WE ALSO ARE INVESTING IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ARE. COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. PROBABLY SPENDING MILLIONS ON MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT WAS PREVENTABLE. BUT IN ADDITION TO THINGS LIKE MEASLES WE NEED TO COMBAT A RISE IN S. STDS -- VALLEY FEVER OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND SO AND THOSE ACTUALLY THEN KERR GREATER COSTS TO ALL OF US IF THEY'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE GET SICK. THE END OF USING HELP MORE HEALTH CARE SO WE'RE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH. I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTES THAT. WAS MENTIONED ABOUT IT PROJECTS AND BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN A CRITIC OF MANY. NOT SO -- I COULD I WOULD CALL FAILED BUT CHALLENGED -- IT PROJECTS BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT AS WE'VE EVER SEEN NUMEROUS IT PROJECTS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- THAT MANY OF THEM ARE ON TRACK WE'LL SEE HOW THEY GO BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT. AND DOES IT PROJECTS OF A CONTINUE CHALLENGE OR AGENCIES SAY THAT THEY ARE GOING TO INCREASE OUR EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCY DECREASE THE OVERHEAD THAT WE ARE SPENDING AS A STATE TO BE SURE THAT MORE MONEY IS GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY ISLA RECOGNIZE IN ADDITION TO OUR OVERALL RESERVES TO AND PROFESSIONS PREPARATION FOR A SESSION WE HAVE ALSO HAVE A SAFETY NET RESERVE AS WELL TO BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO BUY. FOR THEM OUR MOST VULNERABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHO DEPEND ON SERVICES LIKE CHILD CARE AND ARE. IN THAT ACCOUNT SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT. WE CAN SEE IN THIS BUDGET EVEN IN JUST THIS ONE SEGMENT ALONE AND I KNOWTHERE'S WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHERS AS WELL. THAT REALLY ARE ABOUT. BOTH HELPING PEOPLE IN NEED NOW BUT IT BUT ALSO PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE. MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS WERE PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THIS IS WE TALK ABOUT THESE OF THE GOOD TIMES AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ARE TAKING FUNDS AND WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE READY BECAUSE ONE THE WAYS WE'RE GOING TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE IS NOT. JUST TO HAVE. A POT OF MONEY TO WORRY BUT THAT THE DOWNTURN BUT ALSO TO MAKE THE KIND INVESTMENTS WE NEED NOW. SO WE CAN DO THINGS SMARTER. WHICH WE HAVE WE'RE DOING SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T NEED TO SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY TO DOWNTURN STILL PROTECT PEOPLE PROVIDE PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED AND THOSE ARE SOME THE THINGS WE'RE DOING IN THIS BUDGET -- TODAY SO I STAND A STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET -- TONIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN THURSTONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR SOMEONE -- TO COMPLEMENT THE THE BUDGET CHAIR. AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS. OF THE PRO TEM AN ARM MINORITY LEADER. FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK. AND MANY MANY HOURS -- THAT HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO THIS BUDGET. I ALSO WANT -- TO THANK GOD MY BUDGET SUB THREE CHAIR. SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO. FOR DOING A GREAT JOB YEAH AND RUNNING BUDGET SUB THREE AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE MADE A DIFFERENCE THIS YEAR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT -- WE RESTORED SOME SERVICES THAT WERE TAKEN AWAY DURING THE GREAT RECESSION INCLUDING -- PODIATRY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CATCH PEOPLE THAT HAVE UNCONTROLLED DIABETES EARLIER SO WE CAN STOP -- AMPUTATIONS AUDIOLOGY -- VISION -- WE WE DEFINITELY MADE A DIFFERENCE AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE -- YOUR PARTNER IN THAT CENTER. ALSO WHY I THINK IT'S A A GREAT ATTRIBUTES THE THAT WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT THAT PAYMENT TO OUR WALL ABOUT. OUR WALLET THAT IS ENORMOUS AS MONEY UNDER CALLING FROM ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL ARTICULATED. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE AGGRESSIVE. CAN'T AND REMOVING THAT WALLET THAT. YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE THE KIND OF RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND I WANT TO GIVE THE CREDIT FOR THOSE RESERVES. PRIMARILY TO THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OFTEN WE HAVE. TO GET OUR GUIDANCE AND THE MAN'S FROM NOW. BEFORE SOMETIMES WE DO. THE RIGHT THING -- PROP. TO WE NOW HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND THAT EXCEEDS TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WE WITNESS AT THE STATE CAN QUICKLY BE UPSIDE DOWN TO THE TUNE OF FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. IF WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. WHEN THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN? IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO THOSE RESERVES. ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE FRAGILITY IF YOU WILL. OF OUR GENERAL FUND. 1% OF THE POPULATION MAKES A 50% OF OUR GENERAL FUND. MEANING THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE. AND PEOPLE THAT WE LEON. IN THE NAME OF INCOME INEQUALITY. WE HAVE AN OPIATE ADDICTION PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THEY WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND WE ALSO HAVE. AN ADDICTION IN THIS INSTITUTIONAL COLLARED INDUCTION THE SPENDING [inaudible] WE HAVE. I BELIEVE TO BE. THE HIGHEST BUDGET. THAT WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHETHER BURKE WITH THE SURPLUS OF TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND WHILE WE HAVE. THIS INCREDIBLY LARGE BUT IT BUDGET WITH THIS INCREDIBLY LARGE SURPLUS. WHY WOULD WE BE ENTERTAINING ANY TAXES AT ALL? YEAH WE ARE ENTERTAINING. ANOTHER COUPLE OF BILLION DOLLARS. A NEW TAXES IN THIS BUDGET WHICH I'LL GET TO IN A COUPLE MINUTES BUT FIRST I WANT TO SAY -- AND I WANT TO THANK MY AT MY SENATOR COLLEAGUE FROM MODERATE. WHO HAS BEEN A CHAMPION OF DELIVERING CLEAN WATER? HAS THE RIGHT. EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS -- I PARTNER WITH HIM ON MANY OF THE PROVISIONS THAT HE'S BEEN TRYING TO DO. AND I WANT TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND CONGRATULATE US BUT AFTER HE PASSES BUDGET. TODAY AS I ASSUME IT WILL BE PASSED. THAT WE WILL GUARANTEE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR EVERY PERSON. THE COMES INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT WE COULD HAVE VERY EASILY FUNDED THIS. THERE ARE A BUDGET SURPLUS -- I KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK AT A MOLECULE WATER IT'S H. TOO LOW NOT SEE TOO WELL. I STILL FAIL TO SEE THE NEXUS OF WHAT THE CARBON HAS TO DO-- IN USING THESE -- CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO PAY FOR THIS -- IN. RESPONSE TO MY FRIEND FROM FREMONT. TO HAS VERY WELL ARTICULATED THE UTILIZATION THESE FUNDS FOR NON. CLIMATE RELATED ISSUES. WE HAVE A GOVERNOR THAT SAID DURING THE STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS THAT. WE GOT A STOP. OR WE SHOULD ABBREVIATE THIS. THIS BULLET TRAIN. BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'S NOT DOING WHAT. IT WAS INTENDED TO DO WE NEED TO ABBREVIATE IT. ONLY TO SAY THE NEXT DAY THE WAS MISCONSTRUED BUT YET WE SEE A LOT OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO GO TO THE TRAIN THAT. FRANKLY OFFERS NO CLIMATE -- BENEFITS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT TAKES ME TO ARE HOMELESS POPULATION. YES WE BOAST REGULARLY THAT WE ARE OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY THREE TRILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOW CAN WE AS THE THIRD LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH THE BUDGET SURPLUSES THAT WE HAVE. HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SOULS. OUT THERE INCLUDING WOMEN INCLUDING CHILDREN [inaudible] INCLUDING VETERANS. THAT WE HAVE THROWN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS ONLY TO SEE THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS. NOT A DECREASE THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS IN LOS ANGELES ALONE YEAR AFTER YEAR. 16% INCREASE. TO SUCH A POINT THAT. IT'S BECOME A HEALTHCARE CRISIS. IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE'RE WITNESSING TYPHOID FEVER SCABIES LICE. MY FRIENDS THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT BREAKS MY HEART SOMETIMES WHEN. I'M BEING PICKED UP AT THE AIRPORT BY SPECIAL SERVICES AND THE FREEWAY IS JAMMED WE TAKE A SHORT CUT. AND WE GO THROUGH THIS TENT CITY IN SACRAMENTO. AND I SEE THESE PEOPLE WITH BONFIRES AND TENSE -- WOMEN -- THAT I CALL OFTEN THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE. WHY AREN'T THEY? OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. WITH OUR BUDGET I SEE I THINK THE BUDGET IS A A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. AND OUR PRIORITIES. THERE WAS A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT WAS. TRYING TO GIVE. ALL PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IRRESPECTIVE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. FULL MEDICAL BENEFITS. IN FACT IT WAS SENT TO THE GOVERNOR CHAMPION WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. BUT I THINK THE GOVERNOR SOLVE THE STICKER SHOCK. THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND BASICALLY THOSE BILLS ARE [inaudible] DO A PROVIDING FOR SENIOR CITIZENS IS. IS THE AWAY BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. IF WE TOOK THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS BEING PROPOSED. FOR THOSE UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IF WE AMORTIZED IT TO THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT YOU'RE CITIES WOULD DO IN YOUR COUNTIES WOULD DO. IF WE ARE ABLE TO WRITE A CHECK FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE. TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT WE CAN GIVE THEM THE GRAND. WHERE WE COULD SAY WE ARE GOING TO HOUSE EVERY HOMELESS PERSON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. TALK ABOUT A LEGACY LEGISLATURE. IF WE COULD DO THAT WE COULD BASICALLY AND HOMELESSNESS. AS WE KNOW IT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THIS BUDGET CYCLE MY FRIENDS. I AM ALSO STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE THE DELIVERANCE OF SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE. THAT'S GOING TO COST THE TAXPAYERS NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FISCAL YEAR. BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS PRAISE WORTHY. WE SHOULD BE PHILANTHROPIC AND WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING THE FUNDS. AND GIVING THE SERVICES TO UNDERPRIVILEGED AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THE STATE. BUT IT SHOULD NOT DELUDE OUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE LESS FORTUNATE CITIZENS WHO LEGALLY CALL CALIFORNIA THEIR HOME. YOU SEE WE HAVE A SYSTEM MEDI CAL. THAT IS BASICALLY AN INSURANCE IN NAME ONLY. WE'RE BASICALLY SELLING PEOPLE A CAR. WITHOUT AN ENGINE. BECAUSE ONE THING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE FAILS TO DO YEAR AFTER YEAR. AND THAT IS A FULL RESTORATION. OF THE FEES THAT WE PAY PHYSICIANS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CITIZENS [inaudible] RIGHT NOW. THE MEDICAL THREE APPROXIMATE HENCE MOST DOCTORS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. REFUSED TO TAKE IT. SO WE'RE GIVING A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY TO PEOPLE. THE THINK THEY CAN GET. HEALTHCARE. BUT WE'RE REALLY EXACERBATING A SYSTEM. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE RECORDING MORE DOCTORS BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADDING MORE POPULATION WHICH MEANS THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING HARD TO SEE A DOCTOR THAT ARE LOOK. LEGAL CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO BE FURTHER PUSHED OUT. AND WE'RE STILL GOING TO SEE THE END AND THE THE THE DEMAND IF YOU WILL. OF SERVICES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHICH WE NO COST SO MUCH MORE MONEY. WE HAVE 25% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THE ENTIRE NATION. AND WHAT'S EQUALLY. APPALLING TO ME. IT IS A TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX OF THOSE HOMELESS ARE VETERANS THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT. PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US. WROTE A BLANK CHECK INCLUDING THEIR LIFE. SO THAT WE COULD STAND HERE ON THE FLOOR. AND HAVE THIS ABILITY TO HAVE FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DEBATE. OF THIS BUDGET. IF WE TOOK THAT NINETY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERTISE IT TO THE TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX HOMELESS VETERANS. WE COULD PUT. A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. AND STILL HAVE FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO SPARE. BUT WE ALL KNOW MY FRIENDS OF MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES THAT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TO OVER AROUND YES EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND I HAVE TO ASK WHY ARE WE FEELING SO MANY CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. RENTS ARE RISING. UTILITIES ARE GOING UP. WE TALKED ABOUT THE GAS PRICES GOING UP FIVE POINT SIX CENTS THIS YEAR THIS JULY WHY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL AGRICULTURE FEEDS THE WORLD. GET EVERY DAY ONE IN FIVE CHILDREN GO TO BED HUNGRY IT'S JUST [inaudible] IRONIC. ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN STUDY PERFORMED BY THE BERKATA CENTER AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY. CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM RANKS FORTIETH. AT A FIFTY IS FIFTY STATES EXAMPLE FINE. BEFORE WE EXPAND SERVICES OF OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM. WE NEED TO FIX IT. SO WHY COLLEAGUES. HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBILITY IS MORE THAN JUST BEING INSURED HEALTH INSURANCE CAN BE RENDERED UNLESS THE PATIENT CAN'T FIND A HOSPITAL OR DOCTORS WILLING TO SEE THEM. AND AGAIN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE. DR TED MAZER AND YOUR NOSE AND THROAT SURGEON ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION EXPLAIN THE BEST. THE PROBLEM WITH LOW REIMBURSEMENT ISN'T THAT DOCTORS AREN'T MAKING MONEY. IT'S AT THE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET TO GIVE CARE. TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THERE'S A LIMIT TO WHAT YOU CAN DO AND THE PRIVATE PRACTICE WORLD. TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. I WANT TO PLUG THOSE POSITIONS TO DO THE PHILANTHROPIC CARE TAKE CARE OF ARE LESS FORTUNATE CITIZENS. DID YOU KNOW THAT AN AVERAGE OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN EACH YEAR ENROLLED IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM DO NOT RECEIVE THE REQUIRED PREVENTIVE SERVICES. LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS IMMUNIZATIONS LEAD POISONING ASSESSMENTS. AND OPTOMETRY. THIS WAS FOUND BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. THAT MEANS THAT A CLOSE TO A QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN NOT. ACCEPTING THE PREVENTATIVE SERVICES EVEN THOUGH. THEY DO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL. THE OUR REPORT CITED MANY REASONS FOR THIS PROBLEM ONE BEING. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES IS A LOT MEDI CAL PLANS TO SKIRT. MANDATORY TRAVEL RULES THIS MEANS THAT MANY FAMILIES ON MEDI CAL TYPICALLY LOW INCOME. WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES OR SEVERAL HOURS TO GET TO A DOCTOR. AND THESE FAMILIES JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY OR CAPACITY TO DO THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS TRUE IN MY DISTRICT. WHERE IT'S TWO HOURS FROM PALM DESERT TO BLIGHT? IN THE EXPANSIVE COUNTY THAT I REPRESENT. THAT'S AGAIN CHILDREN ARE GETTING THE ACCESS THEY NEED IS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT THE AUDIT FOUND WAS A MEDI CAL WAS FILLING TO ENSURE PLANS THAT MEET THE CULTURAL LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S. DIVERSE POPULATION AS WELL AS LOW PROVIDER REIMBURSE RIVERS FROM RATES CONTINUE. CALIFORNIA'S LAWMAKERS AND MADE IT A PRIORITY TO DRIVE DOWN THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE UNINSURED BUT AMAZINGLY WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST INSURED RATES IN THE NATION AT ABOUT 7% NOW. AND WE HAVE THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS -- COVERED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE UNDERMINE OUR GOAL OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE BY FAILING TO REIMBURSE DOCTORS A LIVABLE RATES. SOME OF MY FRIENDS. I TALK ABOUT WHY WE ARE RAISING TAXES A FEW BILLION DOLLARS SO WE HAVE THESE BUDGET SURPLUSES. STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE A DEDUCTION COMES OFF OF ALL OF OUR PAYCHECKS. WE'RE GONNA DRAWDOWN RESERVES AND THEN ALL OF OUR CITIZENS THAT WORK AND HAVE. PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS WILL SEE ANOTHER TEMP OR TWO TENTHS OF A PERCENT. TAKEN OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECKS. WE HAVE A CELL PHONE TAX SO WE COULD VERY EASILY A FUNDED THROUGH OUR BUDGET SURPLUSES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS VITALLY IMPORTANT SOMETHING WE LEARNED DURING THE THE FIRES OF OF LAST YEAR. SOMETHING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAS ALREADY DONE. WE INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTION FROM ANY PART OF THE STATE OR COUNTRY. THAT COMES INTO OUR JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE NEEDS TO DO THIS. BUT WE DON'T NEED TO RAISE THE TAX ON ALL THE CELL PHONES THE NUMBERS. THAT AGAIN HAS A REGRESSIVE IMPACT. ON THE POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THAT WE TALK ABOUT WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE TO CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS. BUT WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE. IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE THE LOWER [inaudible] INCOME FOLKS. THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE INSURANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. CAN NOW PAY THE STATE MANDATE OF SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS. SO THEY CAN CONTINUE NOT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE TO MAKE UP WHAT. UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A SUBSIDY ON BEHALF OF THE POOR POOREST PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DELIVER HEALTHCARE. WHICH I THINK IS COMPLETELY WRONG. AND THEN PROMISES THAT ARE MADE SHOULD BE PROMISES THAT ARE CAPPED [inaudible] YOU KNOW. PROP FIFTY SIX TOBACCO FUNDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USED [inaudible] TO HELP. THE MEDICAL SYSTEM RAISING MEDI CAL FEES. BUT WE HAVE SUSPENSIONS AT THIS GOVERNOR IS GOING TO USE TO RETAKE TO RATE THE FUND. FOR GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY PURPOSES. ALL THE WAY THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE CITIZENS VOTED FOR IMPROPER [inaudible] FIFTY SIX SO MY FRIENDS [inaudible] THE BUDGET. DOES A LOT OF GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE VERY BLESSED TO HAVE THE INCOME STREAM SO WE HAVE COMING IN AND THAT'S BECAUSE WERE THE HIGHEST TAX TO THE SINS IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD PROP THIRTY TAXES% OPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY THAT BECAME PERMANENT. AGAIN. TO ALL THE CITIZENS THAT ARE LISTENING TO THIS. THERE'S NO SUCH THINGS AS A TEMPORARY TAX IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO BE WHERE. BUT WE NEED TO KEEP OUR PROMISES TO THE TO THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE. WE NEED TO USE OUR MONEY WISELY. WE DON'T NEED TO BE ADDING TAXES WHEN IN FACT WE HAVE BUDGET SURPLUSES. AND WE CAN'T KEEP IMPACTING. THE POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH RESERVE PRESS OF TAXES. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I URGE NO VOTE ON THIS BUDGET BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE CENTER SKINNER. WELL COLLEAGUES I HOPE THAT I CAN NOW ELEVATE YOUR MOODS BECAUSE I STANDING GREAT SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. AND I WANT TO SAY. THE GOVERNOR. ADMINISTRATION ALL OF THE STAFF. OUR BUDGET STAFF. OUR BUDGET CHAIR. EVERYONE WHO WORKED ON THIS BUDGET AND OF COURSE OUR PRO. TEN FOR LANDING SOMETHING WHICH I THINK. IS AN INCREDIBLE. BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIANS REGULAR CALIFORNIANS -- IT'S A BUDGET THAT. ALMOST EVERY CALIFORNIAN IS GOING TO BENEFIT FROM. AND I COULD EXPLAIN WHY BUT BEFORE I DO. HOLD UP THIS PROP [inaudible] NOW [inaudible] WE COULD. SEE THIS GLASS AS HALF EMPTY AND WE'VE HEARD MANY COMMENTS TODAY. THAT WOULD CERTAINLY DESCRIBE. WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO VOTE ON THIS HALF EMPTY? FOR WE COULD SEE THIS GLASS IS HALF FULL. TO SAY IT'S MORE THAN HALF FULL. AND I'M GONNA SAY I HIM SO HAPPY AS A SIX TIME BUDGET CONFEREES. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT I CAN GO HOME AND TELL MY WHICH I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IT'S BRING IN BENEFITS TO THEM. INSTEAD OF THE MANY YEARS WHERE I HAD TO GO HOME AND TELL. THOSE FAMILIES THAT DEPENDED ON IN HOME HEALTH SERVICES SORRY IT'S BEEN CUT IN HALF. OR MY PTA ABOUT HOW MANY FEWER TEACHERS WERE GOING TO BE IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEXT YEAR. OR MY FAMILY'S THAT COULD BARELY AFFORD CHILDCARE HOW BE SICKLY CHILD CARE CENTERS WE'RE GOING TO BE CLOSE OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO. TO CUT. THE BUDGET IN THOSE TERRIBLE RECESSION YEARS. FOR ME JUST DESCRIBE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I'M SO WHEN. YOU SEE ASKED TO CLEAN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET. FOR EXAMPLE AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TEN THOUSAND MORE WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND ARE YOU SEE AND CSU SYSTEM. AND ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TO ATTEND HIGHER READ ARGUED IN A BENEFIT FINANCIALLY WITH OUR EXPANSION OF CAL GRANTS MANY OF THEM EVEN THOSE WHO MAKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. THE HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE VERY HARD TO AFFORD. SO FOR THOSE FAMILIES WE ARE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE SO THEY CAN MEET. BETTER HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COSTS [inaudible] THE END. SO THAT OUR NEW APPEARANCE CAN SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME. WITH THEIR BABIES. WHETHER ADOPTED OR BOARD TO THEM. WE'VE INCREASED PAID FAMILY LEAVE TIME. AND THEN OF COURSE WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO BACK TO WORK. AND A FACE CHILD CARE COSTS THAT ARE. MORE EXPENSIVE THE COLLEGE. WE HAVE EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY AND THE AFFORDABILITY OF CHILD CARE. AND WE'VE ENSURED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND EXPANDED THE PRE K. FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND LET ME TELL YOU AS A WORKING MOTHER WHEN KINDERGARTEN WAS A HALF DAY. I MEAN YOU KNOW THE CHILD CARE COST BEFORE KINDERGARTEN WERE HIGH ENOUGH BUT THEN WHEN I HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO GET MY KID FROM KINDERGARTEN. TO WHEREVER SHE WAS GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE I COULD GET HOME FROM WORK AND THEN COVER THAT COST. WAS EXORBITANT. NOW WE'VE. FAMILIES ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THAT IN CALIFORNIA. OUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE GETTING OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN TAX RELIEF WITH THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT WE EXPECT TO PASS NEXT WEEK. AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHILE. WE LOOK AT THE INCREDIBLE WEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S CORPORATIONS AND WE NOW HAVE A CITY WITH MORE BILLIONAIRES PER CAPITA THAN ANY OTHER CITY. IT IS STILL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY THEY ARE THE MAIN PROVIDER OF JOBS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE GIVING THEM. TAX RELIEF. AND OUR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS. AND STILL THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS TO RELY ON MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY FIND IT MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THEY'RE GONNA GET A BENEFIT FROM THE INCREASE IN OUR EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. AND OF COURSE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REELING FROM THE HEART BREAKING INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. AND THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES HOMELESS WERE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. ARE GOING TO GET AN INCREDIBLE BENEFIT WITH THIS BUDGET WHERE WE HAVE INCREASED THE FUNDING. TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE. MORE SHELTER MORE HOMELESS SERVICES. MORE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE FACING THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE. FUNDS FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN EMERGENCY RENTAL INSISTENCE SO IF THEY FACE THAT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR UNEXPECTED INCREASE IN EXPENSES OR THAT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR. EXPENSE THAT THEY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT ALL OF THE SUDDEN PUTS HIM IN A POSITION WHERE MAYBE THEY COULDN'T PAY RENT WHICH COULD THEN PUT HIM IN A POSITION OF BEING AFFECTED WHICH THEN BAD STORE HOMELESS RULES WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE. EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE. WHAT IS BETTER THAN THAT? AND WITH ALL OF THIS. WE HAVE PUT AWAY FOR THAT EXPECTED RAINY DAY. AND NOT NLY WITH PUTTING INVESTING AT LEAST TWENTY BILLION IN THAT RAINY DAY FUND BUT ALSO TOPPING UP. OUR ONE MINUTE BLOW ITS NAME EXCUSE ME OUR OF A SAFETY NET RESERVE AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHER RESERVES THAT WE'VE CREATED. SO. THIS IS WHY I STAND BEFORE YOU EN INSTITUCIONES STICKLEY RECOMMEND YOUR BY VOTE THE GLASS IS MORE THAN HALF FULL. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. MADAM PRESIDENT [inaudible] I JOIN. IN SUPPORT OF THIS CONFERENCE REPORT [inaudible] AND ADOPT THE PASSION HUMANITY ENTHUSIASM OF MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE. ON BEHALF OF THIS CONFERENCE REPORT. I HAVE SPENT. MANY YEARS IN AT LEAST A LACKS DECADE. FOCUSING. ON WHAT DEEPLY CONCERNS ME ABOUT THE STRUCTURE. OF OUR CALIFORNIA FINANCES. AND THAT IS OUR EXTRAORDINARY VOLATILITY WHICH HAS BEEN EXPRESSED BY MANY OF THE SPEECHES HERE TODAY ON THIS FLOOR. AND THOSE THAT VOLATILITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE COUNTLESS POINT OF VIEW. BUT A VERY HUMAN POINT OF VIEW ABOUT FURLOUGHS AND PROGRAM CUTBACKS IT IMPACTS FOSTER KIDS AND ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT WE CARE ABOUT. AND SO I THINK ABOUT THE LONG TERM. ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE. AND WHY RISE TODAY IS TO SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEW REVENUES AND YES I KNOW WE CAN-IT TAKE HERE AND THERE BUT YOU LOOK AT THE BIG FRAME. 82% LADIES AND GENTLEMAN 82% OF THIS SURPLUS MONEY IN THIS BUDGET BY THIS ADMINISTRATION BY THIS LEGISLATURE EITHER GOES TO A RESERVE ACCOUNT OF WHICH THERE ARE A NUMBER AS WAS MENTIONED. PAID OUT ALL THAT. AND PRE PAY PENSIONS 82%. NOW THAT DOES CERTAINLY HELPS US IN THE NEAR TERM IN THE EVENT THERE SOME LEVEL OF DOWNTURN. BUT I THINK IT EVIDENCE IS A LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF WHERE WE'RE FOCUSED. OF WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR. ARE FOCUSED IN TERMS OF FOLK -- OF DEALING WITH THIS LARGER PROBLEM AND I SUSPECT IN YEARS TO COME AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH VOLATILITY THAT WE CAN PLAN SO THAT WE AVOID THE FURLOUGHS WE AVOID THE CUT BACKS WE AVOID FUTURE LEGISLATORS HAVING TO DEAL WITH WITH SO MANY OF HAD TO DEAL WITH ON THIS FLOOR. DEALING WITH TERRIBLE CUTBACKS AND TERRIBLE CHALLENGE IN THIS BUDGET I APPLAUD THOSE WHO WORKED ON IT I APPLAUD THE EFFORT I APPLAUD THE PRODUCT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR JACKSON. YES SIR -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO INSURE THE SONG CASE SERASA RAW. A VERY MUCH IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SONG IT'S THE STORY OF A MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER IS THE DAUGHTER ASKS THE ADVICE OF HER MOTHER WHAT. WILL MY FUTURE BE. SO ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I WOULD LIKE TO AND HER MOTHER IN PERHAPS HER GRANDMOTHER. WHAT THAT FUTURE WILL BE WITH THE HELP OF THIS BUDGET? WE HAVE NOW AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY SEVERAL OTHERS A RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SOMETIMES CALLED CHILD CARE. HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS ARE OF A CHILD'S LIFE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW AND DEVELOP THEIR BRAIN? AND SO BY THIS BUDGET WE ARE. ADDING ADDITIONAL ESOURCES OF FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND THE CARE GIVERS WHO ARE THEIR EARLIEST EDUCATORS WERE ADDING AN ADDITIONAL TWO WEEKS SO THAT PARENTS CAN SPEND THE TIME TO BOND WITH THEIR NEWBORNS. HOPEFULLY AS YEARS GO ON WE WILL ADD MORE TIME SO THE PARENTS AND THEIR NEWBORNS CAN DEVELOP THOSE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS THAT MOST OF THE REST OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD HAS LONG ACKNOWLEDGED AS IMPORTANT. WE ALSO HAVE UP FISCAL COMPONENTS DEEPLY ROOTED IN THIS BUDGET INCLUDING. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND CAL WORKS ALIGNMENT IN ADDITION WE HAVE DONE WITH THIS BUDGET -- ADDITIONAL MONIES FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- SADLY IS TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE RIGHTS OF THE WOMEN HAVE TO THE REPRODUCTIVE DECISION MAKING AND REPRODUCTIVE CAL HEALTH CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE ADDING THOSE IMPORTANT RESOURCES SO THAT WOMEN. HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE DECISION MAKING IN THE INDEPENDENCE THAT COMES WITH THAT DECISION MAKING. SO FOR OVER A DECADE PERHAPS TWO DECADES NOW THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS FOUGHT FOR GENDER ANY ECONOMIC EQUITY. THAT WOMEN AND FAMILIES TO SERVE AND THIS BUDGET MOVES US FORWARD IN THAT EFFORT HOPEFULLY MUCH MORE TO COME IN THE FUTURE. AND AS MY JEWISH MOTHER USED TO SAY THE GLASS MAY BE HALF EMPTY. BUT IT IS HALF FULL AND WHEN YOU CAN GET THAT OUT OF A JEWISH MOTHER YOU'RE REALLY MAKING PROGRESS THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET. THIS IS AN EX SELECT IT IS MY THIRTEENTH BUDGET IT IS THE MOST. RESPONSIBLE YET BOLD BUDGET IN ADDRESSING THE FUTURE THIS STATE BUT DEALING WITH THE REALITIES THAT COME FROM THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD -- I AM THE PROUD TO BE ABLE TO STAND HERE AND SUPPORTED AND WILL BE VERY PROUD TO CASH MY AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF THIS BUDGET FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY YEAR AHEAD. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER ATKINS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. AND IN A KNOWLEDGE MEN OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY LET ME JUST SAY. FROM WHERE I GREW UP WE JUST HAVE GRATITUDE FOR THE GLASS -- YOU KNOW HIGH -- LET THAT SINK IN -- YOU KNOW I I ACTUALLY REALLY BELIEVE WE HAVE BEFORE US THE BEST BUDGET IN MORE THAN TWO DECADES IF NOT EVER. AND YOU KNOW WHAT A LUXURY WE HAVE. TO GET TO STAND HERE AND ARGUE OVER WHERE WE SHOULD PUT OUR SAVINGS. HOW WE SHOULD SPEND SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL MONEY WE HAVE? TO SUPPORT STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS. ARE WHO FOR DECADES HAVE SEEN SOME OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED -- WHAT A LUXURY WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND HERE AND ARGUE OVER CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WERE TRYING? TO ENHANCE OUR BRING BACK. A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THAT. THAT SUPPORT SO MANY THINGS THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED I DON'T NEED TO TO REPEAT -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- EXCEPT FOR MAYBE ONE I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT WATER -- YOU KNOW THIS BODIES VERY MINDFUL ABOUT FEE INCREASES IN TAX INCREASES IT'S WHY WE APPROACH THE WATER ISSUE. I IN THE WAY THAT WE DID. AND YOU DON'T LET ME JUST SAY WHAT A LUXURY TO HAVE BOTTLED WATER. WHEN I GREW UP IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND CARRIED WATER FROM A SPRING WE DIDN'T HAVE BOTTLED WATER TO EVEN BRING IN? SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET WATER FROM A A RAIN BARREL AND FROM A SPRING. AND TO COOK ON A WOOD STOVE AND MAKE SURE YOU HEAT THE WATER FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE FOR FOOD. TO TAKE A BATH AND A TEN TUB -- YOU KNOW I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE. SO I'VE BEEN IN BOTH WORLDS I'VE BEEN IN THE WORLD WITHOUT IT. AND I LIVE IN THE WORLD WITH IT. AND THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON IN CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD LIVE THAT WAY TODAY. NOT ONE AND SO THAT WE HAVE FOUND A WAY TO DO THIS -- IT WAS OUR INTENT TO USE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS -- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. ARE WE MADE THE BEST OF A NEGOTIATION ACROSS -- THREE PARTIES AND WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO -- SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY IN TERMS OF HOW IN ORDER TO GET IT DONE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WHO STRETCHED. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS AT STAKE IN MAKING THAT DECISION THAT WAS IMPORTANT AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT -- YOU KNOW OUR FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY OH MY GOSH HOW DO HOW MUCH OF A LUXURY IS IT FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO PUT A BUDGET FORWARD THAT WE HAVE WORKED. YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT -- MY BUDGET CHAIRED TODAY'S STARTED NINE YEARS AGO AND SHE'S BEEN ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE EVER SENSE FROM THE ASSEMBLY TO THE YEAH. SENATE SHE'S CHAIR BUDGET THE CONFEREES -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY HAS BEEN IN A COM FREE FOR MANY I THINK SHE SAID. FIVE WE HAVE THE BEST EXPERIENCE HERE TODAY THAT'S HAD TO NEGOTIATE AND TOUGH BUDGETS. AND BETTER BUDGETS. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY WAS SOMETHING WE ASPIRE TO AND IT CAME A BELT. BECAUSE WE PUT FORWARD AN IDEA OF A RAINY DAY FUND FROM THE ASSEMBLY I WAS HERE. THE GOVERNOR EMBRACED IT WANTED TO DO IT WE GAVE STRUCTURE TO IT. AND THEN WE TOOK IT TO THE CITIZENS AND THEY DID WHAT WE KNEW THEY WOULD WHICH WAS TO SAY YES WE WANT THAT. SO WE HAVE. A RAINY DAY FUND WE HAVE A REGULAR RESERVE WE HAVE A SAFETY NET RESERVE WE HAD TO WE HAVE AN EDUCATION RESERVE. AND WE'RE PAYING DOWN DEBT. AND WE'RE PAYING DOWN PENSION LIABILITY. THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MY COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT OF ME HERE THE MAJORITY LEADER GAVE THE PERCENTAGE. WHAT A LUXURY THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY? IN OUR BUDGET. BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T FEEL. THE BENEFIT OF THE SURPLUS. AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO TO BALANCE THAT. WAS TO PUT RESOURCES INTO PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THEY ARE. LOWER INCOME MIDDLE CLASS LIFE. SO THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHERE WE HAVE MOST OF THE VENTURE CAPITALIST. IS IT PERFECT NO IT ISN'T WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET TO PERFECT PEOPLE. IF YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THE PERFECT IT IS NOT IN THIS LIFETIME. BUT I TELL YA WE HAVE. ASPIRATIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FROM REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST CENTRAL. THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE THEM FEEL HOPEFUL. THAT WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE CHALLENGES. WE'VE GOTTEN TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT MONDAY. WE GOT TRAILER BILL SAY GIVE YOU ALL KINDS OF DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET CLOSER. TO MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR OUR NEIGHBORS OUR CONSTITUENTS WE HAVE A HOUSING PROBLEM. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF CRISIS A DECADE AGO BECAUSE WE WEREN'T IN THE BOILING WATER YET. ALONG WITH THE LOBSTER WE WEREN'T THERE. BUT WERE THERE NOW. AND WE'VE GOT REAL STUFF WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SOLVE AT THE SAME TIME THAT WERE ACTUALLY DOING SOME GOOD WE ARE NOT SOLVING ALL THESE PROBLEMS OVERNIGHT BUT IF WE ARE NOT WORKING TOWARDS. BETTER SOLUTIONS SHAME ON US AND SO EACH OF US REALLY HAS THE ABILITY AND THE LUXURY TO QUIBBLE. WITH A PIECE OF IT OR A PIECE OF THAT. BUT YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO GO HOME TODAY TO MY COMMUNITY WELL I'M I'M AWAKE SEE WHAT GETS PUT IN PRINT. AND THEN I'M GONNA GO HOME AT SOME POINT. TO MY COMMUNITY FEELING LIGHT. FIVE FEELING LIKE WE HOPEFULLY HAVE TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR JOB IS LEGISLATORS ON OUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK. APPROVING A BUDGET FOR OUR STATE THAT IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK. AND THEN WE HAVE TO COME BACK ON MONDAY. MADAM BUDGETARY KNOW YOUR WILL BE HERE ALL WEEKEND BUT WE HAVE TO COME BACK ON MONDAY. AND FINISH THE JOB. AND THAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO NEXT WEEK. WE CAN'T LET OUR CHALLENGES KEEP US FROM DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TODAY. AND ON MONDAY. OUR CONSTITUENTS EXPECT US TO BALANCE THESE ISSUES. FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY PUT MONEY AWAY PROVIDED SOME SERVICES THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOR A DECADE MAKING SURE THEIR KIDS CAN GO TO COLLEGE. AND YEAH WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOUSE PEOPLE. SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION MORE DOLLARS FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE IS A START. AND THEN WE'VE GOT A WHOLE HOUSING PACKAGE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE THAT'S ABOUT PRODUCTION. WE KEEP PUTTING MONEY THERE BUT IF WE DON'T DEAL WITH THE PRODUCTION AND WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A CHALLENGE SO I WOULD JUST SAY. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THE GLASS AND THE WATER THAT'S IN IT RIGHT NOW. I FEEL PRETTY GOOD AND I FEEL PRETTY PROUD OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ASKED. AND THE NATURAL TENSION THAT WE PLACE UPON OURSELVES FROM THE POSITION OF BEING IN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY THE GOVERNOR THAT TENSION FROM THE DEMOCRATS THE REPUBLICANS THAT TENSION. THAT WE PUT ON EACH OTHER IS NECESSARY AND SO. I FEEL HAPPY THAT WE GET TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. BECAUSE WE ARE THE FORTUNATE ONES TO GET TO HAVE IT AND WE'RE THE ONES WHO GET TO GO HOME. AND FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE ARE DOING? IN ALL OF THOSE LINE ITEMS. THAT HELPS EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON THAT WE'RE GONNA RUN INTO SO I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT. I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO I IMPLORE YOU TO THINK. ABOUT -- THE BILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- TO SUPPORT AND TAKE UP ON MONDAY THAT ACTUALLY HELPS US MAKE THIS A REALITY AND WHAT IT DOES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE STILL HAVE YET TO DO AND AND TO FEEL SOME SENSE OF OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB TODAY. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH MY INCREDIBLE THANKS TO ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU MAN APPROACHED HIM SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM PRESIDENT.

OF SERVING AS YOUR BUDGET CHAIR OF THE VICE CHAIR -- OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ALWAYS SAYS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK WE AS A BODY DO. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. AND WITH THAT. REGARDLESS OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE MANY OF US PERHAPS DISAGREE. WE CAN ALL AGREE. THAT WHEN CALIFORNIANS ARE AT RISK [inaudible] IN TROUBLE. HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES THEIR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. WHEN THEIR BACKS AGAINST THE WALL THEY CALL US? AND THEY LOOK TO US. AND THIS BUDGET INCLUDES A RESPONSIBLE WITH BOND SERVANT. REACTION IN SUPPORT. TO JUST THOSE CALIFORNIANS. AND NONE OF US SHOULD FORGET THAT. THE WORK OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE. THAT'S THE WORK GOVERNMENT PRODUCES. IT'S EITHER THROUGH TECHNOLOGY OR MAN OR WOMAN POWER. AND SO IT'S OUR JOB TO GUARANTEE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CAN RELY ON THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT AND STATE DEPARTMENTS. THEY HAVE TRAINED PERSONNEL TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. SOMEONE MENTIONED DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE OF US TO CHOKE OF THAT DEPARTMENT TO PREVENT THEM FROM PROVIDING THE CRITICAL SERVICE. THE EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT REQUIRES. SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. TO ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT AND TO PARTNER WITH THAT DEPARTMENT AS LONG AS WELL AS ALL THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S. TO NAVIGATE THROUGH. THE CHALLENGES THEY MAY BE EXPERIENCING. TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN PROVIDE EXCELLENT QUALITY SERVICE THE EVERY CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. THAT'S OUR JOB TO DO. I WELL WE CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE. OUR JOB IS TO PLAN FOR IT TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE HAVE TODAY AND OUR EXPERIENCE FROM THE PAST. PAYING DOWN DEBT. HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THEIR PENSION LIABILITY. INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE QUITE LITERALLY OUR CHILDREN. AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN THIS BUDGET. BECAUSE YOU KNOW COLLEGE YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE CHILDREN DON'T GET DO OVERS. THEY DON'T GET TO STILL BE THREE YEARS OLD WAITING FOR US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THEM A SEAT IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION CLASSROOMS. THEY DON'T GET TO STAY IN THE FIFTH GRADE WHILE WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THEM. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. THEY DON'T GET TO STAY IN HIGH SCHOOL WHILE WE FIGURE OUT. HOW? TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT SLOTS FOR THEM IN THEIR PUBLICLY FUNDED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. YOU KNOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT COLLEAGUES I MUST SAY THAT IT'S DISINGENUOUS.

FOR THINGS LIKE NINE ONE ONE SERVICES TO PROTECT THOSE WHO LIVE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. TAX BREAKS TO SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL BUSINESSES WHO EMPLOY MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THEN THE BIG BUSINESSES ARE COLLEAGUES CLAIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA IN DROVES. FINALLY COLLEAGUES THERE IS NO PORK IN THIS BUDGET. IT CONTAINS INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES. A GOOD RESPONSIBLE USE OF ONE TIME DOLLARS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WITH REGARD TO TIMELINESS WELL. I WAS HAPPY AS BUDGET CHAIR TO RECEIVE LETTER AS LATE AS FRIDAY. FROM A COLLEAGUE WHO NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN HIS DISTRICT A DISTRICT COULD BE RAVAGED BY NATURAL DISASTER. AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE SUPPORT FOR THAT COMMUNITY IS CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET. SO YOU'RE WELCOME. AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS ARE WELCOME FROM THOSE OF US WHO WILL CAST A VOTE TODAY THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE NEEDS TODAY AND TOMORROW. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT CASES THE RAFI RON THE FACT THAT THAT WAS THE MESSAGE FROM A MOTHER. TO A DAUGHTER WELL.
