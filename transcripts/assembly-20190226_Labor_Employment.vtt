ON ON THE REASON WE FOCUS ON THE

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.961

SHIFTING OF POWER AWAY FROM

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:49.440
WORKERS SO THAT'S OUR

OUR WEBSITE AND A LOT OF OTHER

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:11.729
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER GREAT

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:12.363
RESEARCH ON THESE ON THE TOPIC

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.964
SOME IS GONNA.

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.365

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.167
WHAT IS MISS CLASSIFICATION AND

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:17.268
I'LL SAY WHAT THAT TERM MEANS

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:19.037
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:19.704
WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE

00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.339
MISCLASSIFIED WHAT ARE THE COST

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.407
TO THE ECONOMY.

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.975
AND THEN WHAT ARE LEGISLATURE'S

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.344
AGENCIES COURTS DOING TO RESPOND

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:27.111
TO THE PROBLEM THIS

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:28.246
CLASSIFICATION AND WHERE DOES

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.948
THE DYNAMICS DECISION FIT WITHIN

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:33.084
THAT CONTEXT.

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:34.485
I'M SO MISS CLASSIFICATION IS

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.654
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A WORKER IS

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.423
PUT INTO THE WRONG CATEGORY WHEN

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.591
THEY ARE IN EMPLOYEE BUT THEIR

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:41.993
EMPLOYER CALLS THEM AN

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.895
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR --

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:46.831
AND OFTENTIMES A WORKER IS MADE

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:47.899
ME TO AGREE TO INDEPENDENT

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.534
CONTRACTOR STATUS AS A CONDITION

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.336
OF HAVING THE JOB --

00:32:51.402 --> 00:32:52.804
CERTAINLY SOME EMPLOYERS MAY

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.039
UNINTENTIONALLY CLASSIFY WORKER

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:56.908
AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OUT

00:32:56.974 --> 00:32:58.076
WHEN IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE AN

00:32:58.142 --> 00:33:00.011
EMPLOYEE --

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:03.614
BUT TOO OFTEN WE SEE IT HIS WORK --

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.983
INTENTIONAL EFFORTS BY EMPLOYERS

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.552
TO EVADE THE LAW --

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:08.453
IN THE PRACTICE IS ALSO

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:10.021
SOMETIMES CALLED PAYROLL FRAUD --

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.556
BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS ARE

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:12.924
AVOIDING PAYING AND TO PAYROLL

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.225
TAXES -- AND

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:15.460
I'M USING THE TERM MISS

00:33:15.526 --> 00:33:17.995
CLASSIFICATION HERE WHICH IS

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:18.763
KIND OF A TECHNICAL SOUNDING

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.264
TERM -- AND

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:20.998
I'M USING IT THROUGHOUT THE

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.166
PRESENTATION JUST FOR KIND OF A

00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:23.501
SHORTHAND --

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:24.602
BUT I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.870
THAT IT'S IT.

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:27.271
IT SOUNDS MORE TECHNICAL BUT IT

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.873
REALLY CAN OBSCURE WHAT'S WHAT'S

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.341
AT STAKE FOR WORKERS AND FOR THE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:31.342
ECONOMY --

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:34.612
IT'S NOT JUST A CLERICAL ERROR --

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:36.180
EMPLOYERS IN AN INCREASING

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.416
NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES ARE CALLING

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.250
THEIR WORKERS INDEPENDENT

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:41.285
CONTRACTORS AND WHAT THAT DOES

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:42.286
NOT GOING TO LITTLE BIT MORE

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.054
DETAIL IN JUST A MOMENT WHAT

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.389
THAT DOES IS IT DENIES WORKERS

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:45.256
PROTECTIONS.

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.425
OF WORKPLACE LAWS THAT APPLY TO

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:48.893
EMPLOYEES STATUS NOT A MINUTE

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.928
CONTRACTOR STATUS I'M AND IT

00:33:50.995 --> 00:33:52.263
DEPRIVES --

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.564
SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICARE

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.599
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORKER'S

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:56.200
COMPENSATION FUNDS OF BILLIONS

00:33:56.267 --> 00:34:01.105
OF DOLLARS AND REDUCES FEDERAL

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.373
STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.308
THE PARTY TO BENEFIT ARE THE

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.910
EMPLOYERS WHO GET TO SAVE AS

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.945
MUCH AS 30% OF PAYROLL AND

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.614
RELATED TAXES BY CALLING --

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.783
BY MISTAKENLY CALLING WORKERS --

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:12.750
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:16.621
OF EMPLOYEES THE BALANCE IS VERY

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:18.489
MUCH HARM TO WORKERS --

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.124
SHORTCHANGING OUR GOVERNMENT

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:21.859
COFFERS BUT ON THE PRACTICE

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:24.162
BENEFITS EMPLOYERS --

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.763
AN EMPLOYEE MUST MISS

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.732
CLASSIFICATION IS A PROBLEM

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.233
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IS

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.468
PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:31.536
CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WHICH YOU CAN

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:33.471
SEE HERE HOME CARE JANITORIAL

00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.373
TRACKING CONSTRUCTION --

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.742
AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:40.077
HAS FOUND THAT IS MANY IS 30% OF

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:41.579
FIRMS MIS CLASSIFIED THEIR

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:42.480
EMPLOYEES AS INDEPENDENT

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:44.782
CONTRACTORS AND THEN STATE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.317
GOVERNMENT STUDIES --

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:47.785
HAVE OFTEN CITED ESTIMATES THAT

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:49.120
ARE EVEN HIGHER BUT IT IT IS

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.989
HARD TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBERS --

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.124
AND AS I SAID WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:54.592
RESOURCES THAT GO INTO ALL THE

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.494
STUDIES AND SUMMARIZE THEM AND

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.795
LOOK AT LOOK AT THEM --

00:34:57.862 --> 00:35:00.932
I HAVE ON A STATE BY STATE BASIS.

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.433
SO OF COURSE THIS IS TOO SMALL

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.901
FOR PEOPLE TO SEE I'M SURE BUT

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:05.770
IT IS A SCREEN SHOT FROM THE UC

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.839
BERKELEY LABOR CENTER REPORT

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:09.340
THAT LOOKED AT COMMON

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.476
OCCUPATIONS HELD BY INDEPENDENT

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.945
CONTRACTORS AS THEIR MAIN JOB IN

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:14.245
CALIFORNIA.

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:15.279
AND SO.

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:16.848
AGAIN MAYBE STILL TOO SMALL BUT

00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:18.983
WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS THE BOTTOM

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.519
OF THAT LIST WHICH ARE HIGH WAGE

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.688
UP PROFESSIONS AD WHERE WHERE

00:35:23.754 --> 00:35:24.989
THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROFESSIONS

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:25.756
ARE TYPICALLY INDEPENDENT

00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:27.158
CONTRACTORS LIKE DOCTORS AND

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.527
ENGINEERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS.

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:31.462
AND FRANKLY WE'RE NOT REALLY

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.464
THAT CONCERNED IT ABOUT THEM

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.066
BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:36.334
THEY HAVE --

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.668
THE RESOURCES AND THE BARGAINING

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:40.571
POWER AND CAN MAKE THE DECISION

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.005
TO ENTER INTO THOSE

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.073
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.608
THAT THE TYPES OF JOBS WERE

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:46.677
CONCERNED ABOUT --

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:49.914
WHERE LOOPS EXCUSE ME AND I'M

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.315
SORRY IS SO SMALL --

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.818
THE LOW WAGE POSITIONS.

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.553
WHERE WORKERS ARE TYPICALLY

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.021
CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:58.055
CONTRACTORS --

00:35:58.122 --> 00:36:00.525
SO YOU YOU MAY SEE --

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.126
IF YOU HAVE REALLY GREAT VISION.

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:03.094
THAT.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.695
THE SAME GROUPS THAT ARE LISTED

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:06.797
HERE THE LOW WAGE PROFESSIONS

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.299
LOW AND MIDDLE WHICH PROFESSIONS

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.734
THAT ARE --

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.935
THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY

WHICH ARE.

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.508
IN AS YOU MAY REMEMBER FOR THE

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.377
PREVIOUS SLIDE THOSE ARE

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.025

WHEN I ASKED HER GUARDS LIVES SO

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:20.097
THAT I?

00:43:20.164 --> 00:43:22.433
FURTHER HE GAVE ME DIRECTIONS TO

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:24.768
A STREET OUT IN THE AVENUES.

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:26.637
THERE ARE A FEW DAYS LATER I

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.005
FOUND A BEAT UP CHEVROLET

CAPRICE STATION WAGON WHICH HAD

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:34.378
LONG AGO SEEN ITS BETTER DAYS.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.680
THIS WAS CARS HOME.

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:38.349
AND HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN.

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:40.517
THAT FOR SOME TIME.

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.486
I YOUNG HASTINGS STUDENT WORKING

CHEN OWSKI.

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:54.098
SUCCESSFULLY ARGUING THAT THE

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:55.933
CAB COMPANY HAD THE RIGHT TO

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.569
CONTROL THE MATERIAL DETAILS OF

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:02.339
HOW GARTH PERFORM HIS JOB.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.974
GARTH WAS NOT THE ONLY SAN

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.409
FRANCISCO TAXI.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.045
DRIVER TO COME INTO THE CLINIC.

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.381
I REMEMBER TALKING TO OTHERS

COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR THE

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.399
SAME REASON THAT GARTH COULDN'T

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:30.701
GET UNEMPLOYMENT.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:32.469
HE WAS A SO CALLED INDEPENDENT

00:44:32.536 --> 00:44:34.505
CONTRACTOR.

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:36.140
WHEN WE AT THE CLINIC BEGAN TO

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:38.008
LOOK INTO THIS WE FOUND SO MUCH

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:39.309
TO OUR SURPRISE?

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.978
THAT THE COURTS HAD ALREADY

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:42.379
RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:44.348
WE FOUND TO PUBLISH TAXI CAB

BOTH HELD THAT CAB DRIVERS ARE

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:54.725
EMPLOYEES.

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.827
BOTH ARE STILL IN THE BOOKS THAT

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:57.728

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.898

APPEAL HAD FOUND THAT THEY WORK.

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.375
AFTER SOME MORE RESEARCH AND

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.910
SOME ORGANIZING AMONG CAB

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:14.878
DRIVERS WE BROUGHT A CLASS

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.447
ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST FIVE OF

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:19.083
THE MAJOR CAB COMPANIES IN THE

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:21.919
CITY. TO TRY TO GET AN ANSWER.

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:24.321
BY THE TIME OUR CASE WAS FILED

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:26.757
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAD

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:29.393
DECIDED BAROLO AND SONS VERSUS

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.561

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.262
FINDING SHARECROPPING FARM

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:35.165
WORKERS TO BE EMPLOYEES WE

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.134
ACTUALLY CITED THAT CASE IN OUR

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.669
COMPLAINT.

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:40.404
ALONG WITH IT TO PUBLISHED.

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:43.774
TAXI CAB DECISIONS SURELY WE LOG

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:45.976
ON OUR SIDE.

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.377
CARRILLO ANNOUNCED THAT THE

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.746
PRIMARY FACTOR IN MAKING A

00:45:49.813 --> 00:45:51.215
DETERMINATION OF EMPLOYEES

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:54.251
STATUS WAS WHETHER THE EMPLOYER.

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:56.620
HAD THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ALL

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:59.256
NECESSARY CONTROL TO USE THE

00:45:59.323 --> 00:46:01.225
COURTS PHRASE OVER THE OVERALL

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:04.728
OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS IN

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.463
WHICH THE WORKER WAS ENGAGED. TO

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.798
BE SURE THE CASE SAT OUT A

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:10.100
SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED CHECKLIST

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:13.036
OF OTHER FACTORS TO LOOK AT BUT

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:13.971
IT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR.

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:16.273
THAT.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.442
QUOTE THE TEST FOR DETERMINING

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:19.776
WHETHER A PERSON RENDERING

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.412
SERVICE TO ANOTHER IS AN

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:25.816
EMPLOYEE OR AN EXCLUDED

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.351
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:30.554
MUST BE APPLIED WITH DEFERENCE

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.122
TO THE PURPOSES OF THE

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.424
PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION.

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:35.425
ON QUOTE.

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:38.395
THIS IDEA OF DEFERRING TO THE

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:40.264
STATUTORY PURPOSE WAS AN

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:42.900
IMPORTANT SIGNAL WE THOUGHT.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.402
OUR LAWSUIT HAD TWO MAIN GOALS

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.271
FIRST WE WANTED A JUDICIAL

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:49.239
DECLARATION THAT THOSE WE

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.808
REPRESENTED ALONG WITH OTHERS IN

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:54.545
SITUATIONS JUST LIKE FAIRS WERE

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:55.913
EMPLOYEES.

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.448
ENTITLED TO THE SAFETY NET.

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:01.118
THE LAW PROVIDES WE DID NOT SUIT

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:04.321
FOR MINIMUM WAGES OVERTIME PAY

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:05.923
OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.791
ENTITLEMENT TO YOU WE BENEFITS

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.860
WERE APPLICABLE AND TO WORKERS

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:11.762
COMP BENEFITS. FOR INJURED

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:14.031
DRIVERS ESTABLISHING THESE

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:16.567
RIGHTS WE FELT WOULD CLARIFY.

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:18.302
THAT THE PUBLIC FACE COULD NOT

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.537
BE BURDENED AS IT APPARENTLY WAS

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.805
BEING.

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:22.973
WITH A NEED TO SUPPORT

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.542
UNEMPLOYED OR INJURED WORKERS

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.377
EMPLOYERS WOULD KNOW THEIR

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.712
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:32.883
AND WORKERS WOULD NO THERE RIGHT

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.751
RECEIVED A PUBLIC BENEFIT IN

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.620
TAKING THE FIRST STEP TO RAISE

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:37.688
THE FLOOR.

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.823
UNDER VULNERABLE MARGINALLY

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.924
EMPLOYED.

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:43.560
MEMBERS OF A PRECARIOUS CLASS OF

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.895
WORKERS.

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:46.863
WITH A BROAD FINDING OF

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.466
EMPLOYEES STATUS A WHOLE SET OF

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.634
WORKERS OF COLOR.

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.003
FEMALE WORKERS IMMIGRANTS AND

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.905
OTHERS COULD BEGIN TO A CERTAIN

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:56.139
RIGHTS.

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:58.308
THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO EMPLOYEES

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.177
BUT DENIED TO INDEPENDENT

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.213
CONTRACTORS WORKPLACES INCLUDING

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.049
TAXICABS COULD BE MADE SAFER.

00:48:06.116 --> 00:48:08.619
UNDER OSHA AND OTHER LAWS WAGE

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:12.456
THAT COULD BE MORE EASILY ABATED.

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.224
THE TAXI LAWSUIT WENT ON FOR

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.659
YEARS AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:16.760
INTO IT.

00:48:16.827 --> 00:48:19.096
BUT CARRILLO AS WE KNOW AS WE

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:21.031
KNOW SPAWNED A GREAT DEAL OF

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:23.233
LITIGATION IN CALIFORNIA.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.935
AND ELSEWHERE AND THAT

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:27.204
LITIGATION WAS EXPENSIVE.

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.139
FRUSTRATING AND AT LEAST IN THE

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.575
CASES IN WHICH I WAS INVOLVED

00:48:31.642 --> 00:48:34.611
STRESSFUL. FOR BOTH SIDES.

00:48:34.678 --> 00:48:36.780
ALTHOUGH THE CASE MADE IT CLEAR

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.081
THAT WORKER PROTECTIVE

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.182
LEGISLATION WAS TO BE

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.484
INTERPRETED.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:44.087
BROADLY THERE REMAIN PROBLEMS.

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:45.422
ONE IMPORTANT ONE WAS THE NATURE

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:47.791
OF THE LEGAL TEST UNDER BURRELL

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.660
AS APPLIED TO CLASS ACTION

00:48:49.726 --> 00:48:51.228
LITIGATION.

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:53.163
OUR CLIENTS BORE THE BURDEN OF

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.065
PROVING THAT THEY SHARED A

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.134
COMMUNITY OF INTEREST WITH OTHER

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.136
UNNAMED CLASS MEMBERS AND THEY

00:48:59.202 --> 00:49:02.072
COMMON LEGAL AND FACTUAL ISSUES

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.807
PREDOMINATED.

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.910
MORELLO'S MULTI FACTOR ANALYSIS.

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:10.013
USUALLY COMPLICATED THIS PROCESS

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.315
ONE SENTENCE FROM THE CASE THAT

00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:12.482
I REMEMBER.

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:14.951
BEING USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.653
IN THE CLASS ACTIONS THAT I

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.988
HANDLED WAS.

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.390
EACH SERVICE ARRANGEMENT MUST BE

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:23.260
EVALUATED ON ITS FACTS.

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:26.530
AND THE DISPOSITIVE CIRCUIT MAY

00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:29.499
VARY FROM CASE TO CASE THIS

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.134
NOTION ALONE.

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.370
LED TO LENGTHY DEPOSITIONS

00:49:33.437 --> 00:49:37.307
CONVOLUTED WRITTEN DISCOVERY AND

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:38.809
JUDICIAL CONFUSION.

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:41.111
BY THE TIME I BECAME A JUDGE.

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:43.513
IT WAS CLEAR THAT A MULTI FACTOR

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.083
APPROACH WAS LEADING TO A WIDE

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.718
VARIETY RESULTS.

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:49.619
ENDING ON WHICH FACTORS WERE

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:51.455
EMPHASIZED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.322
COURTS.

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.358
CARRILLO AND OTHER CASES LIKE

00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:57.260
THE TAXI DECISIONS WE FOUND WERE

00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:59.196
EXAMPLES OF A LIBERAL

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:00.664
APPLICATION OF THE TEST.

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:02.966
BUT OTHER CASES WENT THE OTHER

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:03.900
WAY.

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.069
THE SAME SEEM TO BE THE CASE

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:07.671
WHEN IT WILL CAME TO DETERMINING

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:10.807
WHETHER TO GRANT OR DENY MOTIONS

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.042
FOR CLASS CERT.

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:14.044
WHILE AYALA VERSUS ANTELOPE

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:16.246
VALLEY NEWSPAPERS UP HELD

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:18.815
CLASSROOMS CERTIFICATION OR

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:21.318
NEWSPAPER CARRIERS PRIMARILY

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:23.587
BECAUSE THE RIGHT OF CONTROL

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:25.021
EVIDENCE --

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.289
BY THE PROVISIONS IN A COMIC

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.759
CONTRACT OTHER CASES HELD

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:31.595
OTHERWISE SOMETIMES IN THE SAME

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:33.864
INDUSTRY.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.133
WHEN AND WHAT CAME?

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:37.801
OUT OF ALL OF THIS FINALLY WAS

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.570
DYNAMICS AND THE A. B. C. CAT

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:44.107
TESS REFERRED TO BY MY COLLEAGUE.

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:45.242
OF FROM NOW.

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:47.077
THE QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.278
IS.

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:51.715
DOES HE AB TEST ABC TESS MAKE

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.016
THINGS BETTER.

FROM A LEGAL POLICY AN

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.570
ANTHROPOLOGICAL LANDS.

ACADEMICS AND BOTH THE US AND IN

00:53:35.178 --> 00:53:37.480
EUROPE. ONE OF MY ARTICLES WAS

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:38.782
IN FACT RECENTLY CITED BY THE

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:41.785
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN THE

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:42.652
DYNAMICS DECISION.

00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:43.720
THERE ARE NUMBER OF

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.488
MISCONCEPTIONS AND PIECES OF

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:47.424
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.558
GET ECONOMY THAT I HAVE ON

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.427
COVERED IN MY MANY YEARS OF

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:51.828
ENGAGED LEGAL.

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:53.730
AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.265
LAW PRACTICE.

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.333
THE FIRST IS THAT THE GET

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.102
ECONOMIES NEW KNOWLEDGE AND

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.236
INNOVATION.

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:02.572
IN FACT BUSINESS MODELS INTENDED

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:04.074
TO LOWER LABOR COSTS BY

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:06.042
UTILIZING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:07.777
LABOR.

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.579
FIRST PROLIFIC PROLIFERATED IN

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:10.947
THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES.

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:12.582
THE SECOND MISCONCEPTION IS THAT

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.184
WORKERS MUST BE CONSIDERED

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.252
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN ORDER

00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.424
BASED ON AN ACCURATE LEGAL

00:54:21.491 --> 00:54:24.394
READING OF THIS DYNAMICS CASE

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:26.029
THIS IS FALSE.

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.664
THE THIRD AND LAST SMITH I WILL

00:54:27.731 --> 00:54:29.299
DISPEL IS THAT THE DYNAMICS

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.635
DECISION WILL DESTROY OR TO TYR

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.837
INNOVATION AND BUSINESS.

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.071
IT WILL NOT.

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.906
FIRST WHY FROM HISTORICAL IN

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.775
LEGAL LANDS IS THE GIG ECONOMY

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:41.344
NOT NEW OR TIED TO TECHNOLOGICAL

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:42.612
INNOVATION.

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.114
THE ANSWER TO THIS LIES IN THE

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.749
HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT TWO

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:47.217
CATEGORIES OF WORKERS.

EMPLOYEES FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:54.157
SOCIAL PROTECTIONS.

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:55.859
AS I SHOW IN MY RESEARCH AND A

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:57.327
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NEIL

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:58.995
GORSUCH POINTED OUT IN HIS

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.864
RECENT UNANIMOUS NEW PRIME BE

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.399
ALL OF THE ARE A DECISION.

IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.301
NINETEEN THIRTIES DURING THE

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:07.103
GREAT DEPRESSION THOSE WHO

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.016
INDEED WHEN THE NEW DEAL WAS

DISTINCT MEANING OUTSIDE AGENCY

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.558
LAW.

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.325
IS CHEWING THE INCREASED LABOR

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.994

THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THIS

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.144
TECHNICALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.947
TEST HAS LED TO AN INCONSISTENT

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.782
INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES.

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:07.717
ON THE SAME SET OF FACTS

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.953
BEFUDDLING BOTH BUSINESSES AND

00:58:10.019 --> 00:58:11.221
WORKERS.

00:58:11.287 --> 00:58:12.522
NOTE THAT THE MOST CONTESTED

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.424
PART OF THE DYNAMICS A. B. C.

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:17.393
TEST PART BE HIGHLIGHTED HERE.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.661
THE ONE THAT IS BEING REPORTED

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:20.964
AS BEING THE MOST RADICAL SHIFT

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.133
IS ACTUALLY ALREADY A FACTOR IN

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.134
THE BURRELL ATTACHED.

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:27.170
DYNAMICS PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE

00:58:27.237 --> 00:58:28.905
EMPLOYER TO PROVE INDEPENDENT

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:31.341
CONTRACTOR STATUS IN SIMPLIFIES

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:32.976
THE BRILLO TEST FACILITATING

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:36.880
CLEAR CONSISTENT LEGAL DECISIONS

00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:38.648
ABOUT EMPLOYEES STATUS.

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:40.483
BUT NOTICE NOTABLY AND THIS IS

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.385
IMPORTANT DYNAMICS DOES NOT

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:44.454
SIMPLIFY THE TEST FOR ALL

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.890
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWS.

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:48.424
RATHER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.393
COURT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.962
ABC TEST ONLY APPLIES TO

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:55.632
CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS.

00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.567
IN DOING SO THE COURT COURT WAS

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.669
RESPONDING TO THIS DYSTOPIAN

00:58:59.736 --> 00:59:01.804
REALITY THAT DOES LABORING AS

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:03.239
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN OUR

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:05.708
STATE ARE SOMETIMES MAKING LESS

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:06.943
THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.378
PUTTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:10.613
BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.315
WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR RENT

00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:14.384
AND WHO PUT TO PUT FOOD ON THE

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.218
TABLE.

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:16.686
AND THIS BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT

00:59:16.753 --> 00:59:17.720
POINT.

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:19.255
GIVEN THE DYNAMICS DOES NOT

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:21.824
APPLY TO CALIFORNIA LAWS OUTSIDE

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:23.393
OF WAGE ORDERS.

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:25.328
THE THE TEST IN ITS APPLICATION

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:26.763
DO NOT RESTRICT WORKER

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.131
FLEXIBILITY.

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:31.868
WHAT THE TEST DOES DO IS AND OUR

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:34.270
A WORKER LABORS?

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:36.239
SHE GETS THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IF

00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.640
SHE LABOURS FOR MORE THAN EIGHT

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:40.310
HOURS IN THAT DAY THEN SHE GETS

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.345
OVER TIME THAT'S IT.

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.280
DYNAMICS DOES NOT CHANGE THE

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:45.949
TEST FOR EMPLOYEES STATUS FOR

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:47.684
WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.218
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND FOR

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.321
OTHER CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:52.722
PROTECTIONS.

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.157
MAYBE IT SHOULD BUT THAT'S A

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:55.558
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION.

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:56.326
IN GARCIA BE BORDER

00:59:56.392 --> 00:59:57.927
TRANSPORTATION THE CALIFORNIA

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.929
APPELLATE COURT AFFIRMED JUST

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.264
THREE MONTHS AGO THAT DYNAMICS

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.433
ONLY APPLIES TO WAIT ORDERS AND

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.635
DOES NOT EVEN EXTEND TO VEHICLE

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:07.470
REIMBURSEMENT WALKS.

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.272
A LOT OF MISINFORMATION HAS

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.974
PROLIFERATED ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.875
INDUSTRY SINCE DYNAMICS WAS

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:13.810
DECIDED.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.478
AND THIS MISINFORMATION HAS

01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.347
RESULTED IN WHAT I BELIEVE IS A

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:19.349
STATE OF HYSTERIA.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:21.150
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AFRAID THAT

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.585
THEY WILL BE UP ENDED.

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:24.087
AND WORKERS ARE AFRAID THAT THEY

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.922
WILL LOSE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.023
NEED.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.458
I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE FROM

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.993
FREELANCE JOURNALISTS TO

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.461
MOONLIGHTING PSYCHIATRISTS TO

01:00:31.527 --> 01:00:33.196
TRUCK DRIVERS WHO SAY THAT

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.664
THEY'RE BEING TOLD THAT THE

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.232
DYNAMICS DECISION MEANS THEY

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.668
CANNOT DO FREELANCE WORK ANYMORE.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.738
AND THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.206
CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL WORKERS ARE

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.575
ALREADY EXEMPT FROM CALIFORNIA

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.677
WAGE ORDERS.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.012
THIS CLASS OF PROFESSIONAL

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:51.514
WORKERS INCLUDES MOST DOCTORS

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.050
ENGINEERS ACCOUNTANTS ARCHITECTS

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.785
MANY JOURNALISTS AND EVEN

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:57.453
ARTISTIC PROFESSIONALS WHO

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.489
PERFORM WORK THAT IS CREATIVE OR

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.556
ORIGINAL.

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.524
THE PROFESSIONAL HAS TO MEET A

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.926
SALARY TEST AND A DUTY STASHED

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.129
AND IF SHE DOES THE DYNAMICS AND

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:07.697
MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PRODUK

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:11.501
PROTECTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO HER.

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:12.969
EVEN FOR THOSE WHOM DYNAMICS

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:14.937
CLEARLY APPLIES NAIL SALON

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.606
WORKERS MANY CONSTRUCTION

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.674
WORKERS UBER DRIVERS DOOR DASH

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:20.109
INSTEAD CART WORKERS.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.778
THE DECISION DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.380
WORKERS HAVE TO WORK SHIFTS AND

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.815
LOSE THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:26.849
FREEDOM.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.017
THESE ARE THREATS MADE BY

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:29.886
COMPANIES WHO DO NOT WANT TO PAY

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.588
THE VERY BASIC MINIMUM WAGE.

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:35.825
GIVEN HOW EASY IT IS TO TRACK

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:38.294
THROUGH AN APP ON A SMARTPHONE.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.829
IMPLEMENTING DYNAMICS WILL

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.164
REQUIRE NOTHING MORE OF

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.899
COMPANIES THAN PAYING WORKERS

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.001
MORE OF SHARING MORE OF THE

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:48.071
PROFIT PIE WITH THE VERY PEOPLE

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.572
WHOSE LABOR PRODUCES WEALTH.

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:50.506
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE LAW

01:01:50.573 --> 01:01:51.774
PROFESSOR.

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.009
LET ME DRAW ATTENTION TO THE

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:55.211
ANALYSIS OF A PARTNER AT LIVE

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:56.446
LITTLER MENDELSON.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.481
THE PREMIER EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.716
DEFENSE FIRM WHO REPRESENTS MANY

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.018
MEDIUM TO LARGE BUSINESSES IN

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.220
CALIFORNIA INCLUDING UBER

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.889
WALMART APPLE IT'S SUCHA.

01:02:06.956 --> 01:02:08.191
HERE'S A PARTNERS WHO

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.258
SPECIALIZES IN THIS

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.294
CLASSIFICATION WRITING THAT

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.329
BECAUSE DYNAMICS ONLY APPLIES TO

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.431
WAIT ORDERS IT APPLIES ONLY TO

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.233
WORKERS WHO ARE NON EXEMPT

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.201
EMPLOYEES.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:19.802
THUS EVEN IF WORKERS ARE

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.804
EMPLOYEES UNDER THE TEST SO IF

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.272
YOU DO THE ANALYSIS YOURSELF AND

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.574
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.776
UNDER THE TEST YOU STILL MIGHT

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:27.777
NOT GET THE PROTECTION OF THE

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.445
TEST.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.980
IF YOU ARE AN EXEMPT EMPLOYEE.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.081
IT APPLIES ONLY TO WORKERS WHO

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.250
ARE NOT EXACT.

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.852
HE ALSO SAYS BECAUSE THE WEIGHT

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.720
ORDERS IMPACT ONLY A LIMITED

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.922
NUMBER OF ISSUES IT MAY BE OF

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.657
LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IF A WORKER

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:43.226
IS AN EMPLOYEE FOR WHICH

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.627
PURPOSES SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.529
MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.364
YOUR GREAT.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.832
SO WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.167
THIS TEST THAT.

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.735
NOT WORKERS WHO ARE ALREADY

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:54.370
MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE NOT

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.838
PROFESSIONAL WORKERS WHO ARE

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.673
EXEMPT FROM WAGE ORDERS AND

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.275
CERTAINLY NOT THE WORKERS WHO

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.177
NEED OR WANT FREEDOM AND

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.812
FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR JOB.

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.080
THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.381
WORRIED ABOUT DYNAMICS ARE

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.517
COMPANIES THAT AS A MATTER OF

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:09.118
BUSINESS PRACTICE UNDER PAY

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:10.386
THEIR WORKERS.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.587
THESE ARE THE COMPANIES LIKE

01:03:11.654 --> 01:03:12.922
DOOR DASH AN INSTA CART WHICH

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.423
ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE TAKEN TIPS

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.459
FROM CUSTOMERS TO COMPENSATE THE

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.227
BASE PAY FOR THE DELIVERY

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.095
DRIVERS.

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:20.863
IN LIKE UBER WHICH NUMEROUS

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.298
STUDIES HAVE REVEALED PAY THEIR

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:25.468
WORKERS LESS THAN THE MINIMUM

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:26.903
WAGE OF MOST MAJOR CITIES.

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:27.703
THESE COMPANIES SAY THAT

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.839
DYNAMICS IS RETROGRADE THAT IT

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.407
DISCOURAGES INNOVATION.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.209
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THERE IS

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:35.011
NOTHING INNOVATIVE OR KNEW ABOUT

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:37.079
UNDER PAYING AN OVER WORKING

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:38.214
LABORERS.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.815
THE IDEA THAT WHAT WORKERS

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.484
REALLY NEED IS NOT MINIMUM WAGE

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:42.785
PROTECTIONS BUT SOMETHING ELSE

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:45.321
ENTIRELY SAY PORTABLE BENEFITS

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.291
IS FALSE WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.492
EMPLOYEES INDEPENDENT

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:52.528
CONTRACTORS WORKERS LABOR SMALL

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.096
BUSINESSMEN EVERYONE.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:58.100
EVERY WORKING CALIFORNIAN DESERT

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.436
THAT CAN SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.504
AND LET ME ADD ON THE TOPIC OF

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.773
PORTABLE BENEFITS THAT THE ACA

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.074
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOCIAL

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.509
SECURITY A MINIMUM WAGE AND

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.077
OVERTIME PROTECTIONS ARE ALL

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.713
PORTABLE BENEFITS WORKERS CAN

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.415
TAKE THESE FROM JOB TO JOB.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.150
IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ADD

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:15.051
TO THIS LIST OF WORKER

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.153
PROTECTION FOR THEM THAT'S GREAT

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.721
THESE WORKERS NEED PAID VACATION

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.289
THEY NEED PAID SICK LEAVE BUT

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:21.691
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE HARD

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.594
FOUGHT FOR RIGHT. TO A MINIMUM

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.562
WAGE AWAY FROM THEM THINK.

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:27.530
I HAVE JUST ONE LAST WEEK AND

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.130
ONE LAST THING PUESTO EIGHTY

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:29.198
YEARS AGO WHEN HE FOUGHT FOR THE

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.633
FIRST FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.134
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT FAMOUSLY

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.669
ARGUED THAT NO BUSINESS WHICH

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.238
DEPENDS FOR ITS EXISTENCE ON

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:36.839
PAYING LESS THAN LIVING WAGES TO

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:37.873
ITS WORKERS.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:39.442
HAS ANY RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:40.509

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.678
TIME AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE NOT

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.180

COMPANIES CAN PAY WORKERS WHAT

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.185
THEY DESERVE BY LAW.

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:50.519
IT MIGHT MEAN SPENDING LESS

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.754
MONEY SETTLING THIS

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.923
CLASSIFICATION CASES LESS MONEY

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.958
DOLED OUT TO EXECUTIVES LESS

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.893
MONEY PAID TO LOBBYISTS BUT THE

WORKERS WHO DRIVE THE CARS AND

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.497
TRUCKS TO CLEAN THE HOMES.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.732
WHO BUILD THE BUILDINGS TO DO

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:04.667
OUR SERVICE WORK ARE THE ONES

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.168

THIS STATE AND THEY DESERVE AT

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.042

FOR MEMBER BECAUSE I HAVE A

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:22.285
COUPLE AND THEN ALL WILL ASK MY

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:22.852
COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY

01:05:22.918 --> 01:05:25.421

SO OF A MISS MADE THE AND IT

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.970
SOMETHING ONE YEAR CHART SHOW

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:45.308
THAT OF A AND THEN YOU INTO LEE

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:46.309
IS A GOOD THING THAT THE JUDGE

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:48.044
EVEN MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:48.244
THAT.

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:49.879
IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CLARITY CAN

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.147
BE HELPFUL.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.349
AND BUT AS A NATIONAL THINK TANK

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:54.083
WHAT IS --

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.717
ANY -- P.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.218
LEARNED ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.653
THE TEST IN OTHER STATES AS OR

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.889
AT LEAST TO EMPLOYER CONCERNS.

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:02.425
BUT IT'S SWIM FLEXIBLE AND PUT

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:03.959
COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS OR OR

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.262
OR INTERRUPT THEIR KIND OF

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:07.930
BUSINESS MODEL.

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.131
SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.733
THE A. B. C. TEST IS USED IN

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.867
OVER HALF THE STATES BUT IN

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.169
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONTEXT

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.637
DEPENDING ON THE STATE SO.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:15.871
JUST TO BE CLEAR SO --

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:17.573
THE MAJORITY OF STATES USE IT

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.141
FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.876
PURPOSES FOUR STATES INCLUDING

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.445
CALIFORNIA BUT MAYBE MORE THIS

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:22.845
YEAR --

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.013
BECAUSE SOME OTHER STATE

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.081
LEGISLATURES ARE CONSIDERING THE

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:26.115
A. B. C. TEST FOR WAGING OUR

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.717
PURPOSES --

I GUESS I'LL ANSWER YOUR

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.852
QUESTION WITH SAYING THAT WE

01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:31.921
DON'T TYPICALLY --

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:34.423
LOOK AT LIKE OUR OUR FOCUS IS ON

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:36.292
THE EFFECTS ON WORKERS AND ON

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.259
THEIR ACCESS TO RIGHTS AND

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.794
BENEFITS AND AND BASIC STANDARD

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:40.963
SO -- I'M

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.597
NOT SURE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON TO

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.799
ASK ABOUT I DON'T THINK THAT

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:46.035
THAT'S OUR ROLE. TO IDENTIFY

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.671
THAT BUT IT JUST IF YOU'VE I

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:49.638
GUESS WE CAN ASK HIM WILL BE

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.006
EMPLOYERS APPEAR VERY SOON AS WE

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:54.377
CAN ASSN THAT AND THEN I AM.

01:06:54.443 --> 01:06:55.978

AND SOME YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.885
REGARDING THE GIG ECONOMY

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:03.185
[inaudible]

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:05.321
DO YOU.

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.922
DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.858
KIND OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS

01:07:08.924 --> 01:07:10.659
OF THOSE THAT RELY ON THAT FOR

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.494
THEIR SUSTENANCE.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.296
THAT KIND OF WORK YES SO I HAVE --

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.531
IN PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE IF

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.499
YOU'RE REFERENCING SORT OF THE

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:17.767
TECHNOLOGICALLY ENABLE GET A

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:19.502
CONNIE I SPENT YOU KNOW OVER

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:20.836
FOUR YEARS --

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.505
WORKING ALONG SIDE AND WITH TAXI

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.906
WORKERS AND SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.441
THE ADVENT OF UBER AND LEFT AND

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.909
THEN I SPENT TWO YEARS DOING

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.244
RESEARCH --

01:07:28.310 --> 01:07:30.146
WITH UBER DRIVERS --

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.014
WHO WORKED IN SAN FRANCISCO --

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.417
THESE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY LACK

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.786
ANY KIND OF REGULATION BASICALLY --

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:38.621
WITH THE UNLIKE TAXI DRIVERS WHO

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:40.790
HAD WHO HAD --

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:44.527
VEHICLE CAPS AND FAIR REGULATION

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:45.728
THROUGH THEIR CITIES.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.496
MANY OF THEM ARE ESSENTIALLY

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.365
MIGRANT WORKERS THEY COME UP

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.200
FROM ORANGE COUNTY AT THE LA

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:52.768
AREA TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:54.003
AREA -- THEY

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.272
SLEEP IN THEIR CARS THEY DRIVE

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.606
SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY --

01:07:57.673 --> 01:07:59.141
MANY ARE MAKING LESS THAN THE

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.543
MINIMUM WAGE THEIR WAGES ARE

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.645
COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE --

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.680
AND I TAKE SERIOUSLY THE FACT

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.315
THAT THEY NEED FLEXIBLE AN

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:07.483
INDEPENDENT --

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.852
LIVELIHOODS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:11.854
ARE LIVING TRANCE NATIONAL LIVES --

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.222
THEY ARE A FAMILY --

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.458
THEY HAVE FAMILIES THEY ARE ARE

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.126
USING THIS WORK TO SUPPLEMENT A

01:08:17.193 --> 01:08:19.128
SECOND JOB --

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.763
AND THESE FOLKS OVERWHELMINGLY

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:21.897
TELL ME.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.032
INTERESTINGLY IN THIS IS THE

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:24.567
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVEYS AND

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.535
ETHNOGRAPHY AND MY SURVEY --

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:27.736
RESEARCH I FOUND THAT MANY

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.171
DRIVERS SAID NO NO WE WANT TO BE

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.873
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ABOUT

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.042
60% OF DRIVERS --

01:08:33.108 --> 01:08:35.010
BUT THEN WHEN I DID LONG

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.579
INTERVIEWS WITH THESE DRIVERS

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:37.947
THE REASON THAT THEY WANTED TO

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:38.848
BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:39.849
BECAUSE THEY SAID THESE

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:41.884
COMPANIES ARE SO HORRIBLE.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.118
THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THEIR LIVES

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.488
WOULD BE EVEN MORE HORRIBLE AS

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:48.724
AN EMPLOYEE --

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.794
AND OVERWHELMINGLY EVERYONE EVEN

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.896
PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT THEY THAT

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:55.164
THEY NEEDED --

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:56.432
THEY NEEDED THEY WANTED TO BE AN

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:57.666
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BECAUSE

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.134
THEY ASSOCIATED THAT --

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.736
STATUS WITH FLEXIBILITY AND SO

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.171
PART OF WHAT I REALLY WHAT I

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.172
WRITE ABOUT AND WHAT I THINK IS

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:04.607
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO

01:09:04.673 --> 01:09:07.510
UNDERSTAND IS THAT --

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.144
BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR --

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:10.613
BEING AN EMPLOYEE FOR WAGE

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.082
PURPOSES DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.283
HAVE TO LOSE FLEXIBILITY --

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.918
INDEPENDENCE IT REALLY JUST

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.254
MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT THE WAGE

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.691
FLOOR.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:24.660
AND AN LITTLE.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:25.961
THANK YOU AND AND AND JUDGE

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:27.396
SHOULD THE THE INITIAL QUESTION

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:28.063
I HAD FOR MISS MADE THAT JUST

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.031
REGARDING.

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:29.732
THE GIVEN THE FACT YOU BEEN KIND

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:31.066
OF IN THE SPACE FOR A VERY LONG

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:31.901
TIME -- DO

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.068
YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:34.136
EMPLOYERS ISSUES OF IN THEIR

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.804
SIMPLICITY BUT WHAT EMPLOYERS

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.373
ISSUES MIGHT BE.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.309
WITH THE A BC ROLE IN TERMS

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.378
ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:42.678
[inaudible]

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.345
I DO.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.414
FROM MY EXPERIENCE --

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.850
MEDIATING CASES AND ALSO WHILE I

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.652
WAS ON THE BENCH AND I HAVE TO

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.120
SAY THAT.

01:09:51.186 --> 01:09:52.788
THERE ARE SITUATIONS

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:54.490
PARTICULARLY INVOLVING SMALL

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:55.691
BUSINESSES.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:58.627
WHEN EVERYONE INVOLVED --

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.363
SEEMS TO WANT --

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:02.765
A FLEXIBLE.

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:05.000
ARMS LENGTH BUSINESS

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.769
RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERIZED.

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:08.671
BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:08.971
[inaudible]

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:11.941
THE THEY SHARECROPPERS IN

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.842
CARRILLO.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:15.377
OUR FAMILIES WHO MADE THEIR

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:19.715
LIVING --

01:10:19.782 --> 01:10:21.784
HARVESTING CUCUMBERS --

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:23.285
THEY WANTED THAT.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.454
THEY WANTED THAT.

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.822
HOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:28.457
HAD THEIR KIDS WORKING IN THE

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.326
FIELDS WITH THEM?

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:31.894
AND THAT'S WHAT THE AD

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.529
DEPARTMENT IN MODESTO INDUSTRIAL

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:37.099
RELATIONS NOTICED AND THAT'S WHY

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:38.567
THE CASE CAME ABOUT.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:41.437
BUT I'VE SEEN ON THE BENCH OUR

01:10:41.503 --> 01:10:43.072
CAR WASH --

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:46.175
WORKERS OF YOU KNOW WHO MAKE A

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.543
LIVING GETTING.

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:50.679
A BIG TIPS FROM CARS THEY DETAIL

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.114
AS WHO WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:55.651
CONTRACTORS AND THEIR EMPLOYER --

01:10:55.718 --> 01:11:01.223
DESCRIBES ITSELF AS IT POSSIBLE

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.525
FOR THESE ENTREPRENEURS. TO DO

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.394
WHAT THEY DO.

I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT.

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.508
WHICH REALLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.076
THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW AND I I

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:36.345

AND ALL BEDS.

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:41.016
THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS

THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT RESPOND

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:48.590
RIGHT IF THEY'RE INDEPENDENT

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:50.192
CONTRACTORS ESPECIALLY THEY HAVE

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.528
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY TED TO

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:53.796
PAY ON THEIR OWN SO IT IS A

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.130
MATTER OF IS A BEING PULLED OUT

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.499
OF YOUR PAYCHECK NOW OR ARE YOU

01:13:57.566 --> 01:13:59.201

REALLY A CLEAR FOR FOLKS AS WELL.

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.574

IS THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.945
THAT'S THE SHIFT WHEN YOU HAVE

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.680
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR CREDIT

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:12.181

EMPLOYER CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE TO

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.599
PAY MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:31.867

WAGE THE EMPLOYER.

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:40.843
OSTENSIBLY IS GETTING THE SAME

ANY OF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:11.807
THIS -- AND

ASKING A QUESTION I KNOW THE

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:15.777

NOTHING TO CHANGE THE POSITION

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:25.020
THEY WERE IN BECAUSE IN TWENTY

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.688
TWELVE THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:27.256
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE IS A

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.390
CLASS ACTION RIGHT THIS WAS.

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:31.159
THEIR THEIR POSITION AS

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR SOME

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:34.663
PLACE HAD BEEN ALREADY SETTLED

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:39.468
LAW IS THAT CORRECT YOU WANT TO

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:42.037

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.643
IT.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:50.412
IS VERY CLEAR BASED ON MY OWN

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.648
LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT THESE

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:55.517
WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.486

CONSISTENTLY LOST UNDER THE

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:09.431
BRELO STANDARD.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.433
AS WELL AS UNDER --

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.936
UNDER THE A. B. C. TASK THE

DYNAMICS TEST SO THE WOMEN THAT

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:17.406
I HAVE SPOKEN TO WHO ARE

01:16:17.472 --> 01:16:18.941
CONCERNED THAT THEIR WAGES HAVE

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.809
DROPPED SINCE THE BUSINESS MODEL

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.477
HAS CHANGED --

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:25.881
I THINK HAVE BEEN --

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:26.949
IT'S WHAT --

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.617
WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT THE

01:16:28.684 --> 01:16:31.787
COMPANIES REFUSED TO INCREASE

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.989
THE AMOUNT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:34.923
WITH LABOR?

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.125
AND ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:38.961
BOTTOM LINE FOR THEMSELVES --

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:40.395
WILL NOT SHIP APPROPRIATELY

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:42.097
SHARING HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.465

BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION --

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.272

OF ONE OF THE YEAH.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.419
CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO SOLVE

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:06.755
PROBLEMS OF THIS SORT BY MEANS

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.690
OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION.

IS THE EASE WITH WHICH OUR

BUSINESSES.

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:22.804
ARE ARE CAN TRANSFORM THEMSELVES --

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:25.007
WHEN WE WERE LITIGATING Và ON

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:28.410

BE RENEWED AT THE END OF EACH

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:37.919
WEEK.

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:41.490
WAS AN ASPECT OF CONTROL THAT

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.392
THE COMPANY'S EXERCISED OVER THE

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.560

IN THE TERM OF THE LEASE.

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:51.566
OR THEY MADE OTHER CHANGES THAT

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.068
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COUSIN DRIVE

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.903
YOU CAN HAVE A HELPER OR

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:56.171
WHATEVER --

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.140
AND THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING

01:17:58.206 --> 01:17:59.374
AND OTHER --

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:01.710
INDUSTRIES WHERE AND THIS IS THE

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:04.613
GENIUS OF CAPITALISM OF COURSE

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:05.414
THAT.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.415
THE COMPANIES --

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.784
FEEL A LEGAL THREAT AND THEY

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.619
CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO THINGS TO

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:14.423
AVOID THAT THREAT.

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:15.824
AND IT IT JUST LEADS.

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:17.692
HAS LED TO A MORASS OF

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.127
LITIGATION AND CHANGING

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:21.329
STRUCTURES --

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:22.798
THAT I THINK --

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:25.867
THE A. B. C. TEST HOLDS GREAT

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:28.136
PROMISE IN TRYING TO BRING.

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.638
A LITTLE CLARITY.

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:30.238
TO I HAVE A LITTLE QUESTION

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.940
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:32.774
TALKING ABOUT THIS MY OFFICE A

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.042
LOT -- AND

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.977
YOU WORK CLEAR IN THE LAW I'M AS

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:37.646
FAR AS FAR AS DYNAMICS GOES IT

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:39.214
DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:40.449
FLEXIBILITY ON WAIT AN HOUR.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:41.483
I WOULD TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.685
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:46.922
FIGURE OUT HOW --

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:49.758
IN WHAT SITUATION IN AN EMPLOYEE

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.560
EMPLOYER SITUATION --

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:54.096
CAN AN EMPLOYER NOT BE FLEXIBLE

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:56.798
WITH A WORKER IS IS FLEXIBILITY

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:58.200
A PORTION OF THE LOT WORKING OF

01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:00.035
AN EMPLOYER ALWAYS BE FLEXIBLE

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:03.872
ON HOURS WORKED TIME PERIOD --

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:07.976
AND AND DESIRE TO WORK.

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:08.577
OR IS THERE SOMETHING LAW THAT

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:09.945
PREVENTS THAT.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.280
SO THE ONLY THING IN THE LAW

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:12.981
THAT.

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:16.818
THAT REALLY IMPACTS TIME IS

01:19:16.885 --> 01:19:18.753
OVERTIME PROTECTION SO IF YOU

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.222
WORK FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS A

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:21.490
DAY OR FORTY HOURS A WEEK THEN

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:22.624
YOU GET.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:25.127
OVERTIME AND WHEN THE FAIR LABOR

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:26.661
STANDARDS ACT WAS PASSED THE

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.163
REASON THAT THESE OVERTIME

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.031
PROTECTIONS WERE INCLUDED WAS

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.299
NOT JUST SO THAT WORKERS AND

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.435
MADE MORE MONEY BUT ALSO SAID

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.436
THAT THEY DIDN'T SPEND ALL OF

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:35.437
THEIR TIME.

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:38.740
WORKING ALL THE TIME --

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:40.942
THE THAT THE SHIFT THE IDEA OF A

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.611
SHIP'S TWITCH KANE CAME OUT OF

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.479
SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.014
DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.216
IS NOT ENDEMIC TO HOW WE

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.085
REGULATE WORK --

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.920
FOR EXAMPLE IF --

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.455
IF YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY LIKE AND

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:55.390
LIKE I AM AND YOU WORK AT A LAW

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:55.957
FIRM.

01:19:56.024 --> 01:20:00.162
YOU CAN LOG YOUR HOURS A NIGHT

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:02.898
AID AND GET PAID THAT WAY IF YOU

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:04.566
ARE AN UBER DRIVER YOU CAN TURN

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.867
ON YOUR APP.

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.069
AND AND THAT THE COMPANY KNOWS

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.971
EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU'VE WORKED

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:11.773
FOR WHAT YOU GET PAID FOR IS THE

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.542
TIME THAT YOU WORK WHETHER OR

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:15.310
NOT YOU WORKING A SHIFT IS A

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.678
BUSINESS DECISION.

01:20:16.745 --> 01:20:19.080
THAT IS SEPARATE FROM --

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.715
SEPARATE FROM THE THE LEGAL

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:22.317
STANDARD SO THIS NOTION OF

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.885
FLEXIBILITY WHEN PEOPLE SAY I

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:26.288
WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT A

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.589
FLEXIBLE WORKPLACE.

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:28.924
THAT IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.892
THE EMPLOYER TO OFFER AN

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.694
EMPLOYEE OF FLEXIBLE WORK PLACES

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:34.963
THAT NOT TRUE YEAH WHETHER I AM

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.964
WRITING A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT THIS.

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.699
ABOUT THE MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.600
FREEDOM AND FOR EXTRA

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.735
FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORKPLACE AND

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:41.603
WORKERS TAKE THE THEM NOT JUST

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.837
WORKERS SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:44.472
EVERYONE TAKES THIS IDEA REALLY

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.374
SERIOUSLY NO ONE WANTS TO BE

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:47.475
UNDER THE THUMB OF THE BOSS.

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:50.579
NO ONE THAT'S WHY I BECAME A LAW

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:51.613
PROFESSOR --

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.681
YOU KNOW I I DEEPLY UNDERSTAND

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.216
THE DIGNITY DIGNITY ISSUES

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:57.219
INVOLVED HERE AND AND CONFLATING

01:20:57.285 --> 01:20:58.753
THESE TWO THINGS BASICALLY PER

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.255
STANDARDS AND FRIEDMAN

01:21:00.322 --> 01:21:01.489
FLEXIBILITY.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.426
AS AN EMPLOYER LINE THAT --

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:07.262
THAT I THINK A DOES A DISSERVICE

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.697
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:11.166
PRODUCING THE WEALTH FOR THE

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:12.033
COMPANIES.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.769

WE DON'T OPERATE IN THAT FIELD

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.044

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.691
ALSO.

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:24.793
SERVICE SIMILARLY TO THE THE

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:25.593
LAST PANEL --

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.262
ANY PRESENTATIONS POWER POINTS

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.431
INFORMATION YOU WANT US TO HAVE

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.131
OR TO BE PUT ON THE PUBLIC

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.032
DOMAIN --

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.367
WILL CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:34.803
DO THAT AS WELL.

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:37.405
AND SO -- A

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:38.773
JENNIFER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.641
I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:40.875
COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.377
AND THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:24:42.444 --> 01:24:43.378
TO DISCUSS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:44.946
ISSUE IS THE DYNAMICS DECISION I

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.481
DID HAVE PLANNED REMARKS BUT I

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:47.348
THINK I'M GONNA JUMP AROUND A

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.516
LITTLE BIT JUST SOME OF THE

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.651
DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR PANEL

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:50.051
AND ADDRESSING.

01:24:50.118 --> 01:24:51.753
THE ISSUES --

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.921
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE BRELO

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:53.988
STANDARD WAS THE STANDARD IN

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.356
EFFECT FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.091
YEARS BEFORE THE DYNAMICS

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:58.760
DECISION WAS ISSUED AND DESPITE

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.295
THAT PRIOR COMMENTS WE BELIEVE

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:01.863
THAT IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:03.097
IN THE STANDARD --

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:04.632
THE ELEVEN FACTORS THAT WILL BE

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.167
REALIZED IN THAT BRELO DECISION

01:25:06.234 --> 01:25:07.268
WAS THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:08.470
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU DIDN'T

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:10.271
HAVE TO MEET EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.040
THOSE FACTORS YOU LOOK THAT KIND

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:13.107
OF THE OVERALL --

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.809
SITUATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:16.110
THE RELATIONSHIP AND DETERMINE

01:25:16.177 --> 01:25:17.579
WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELT MORE ON

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:18.813
THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SIDE

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.782
OR THE EMPLOYEE SIDE YES WHETHER

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.350
YOU'RE WORKING IN THE SAME

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.284
BUSINESS AS THE HIRING AND TO BE

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.053
WAS A FACTOR BUT IT WASN'T ONE

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:26.187
OF THE MANDATORY FACTORS THAT

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:26.488
HAD TO BE.

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.490
MET AND IT WAS LARGELY FOCUSED

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.557
ON THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THAT THE

01:25:29.624 --> 01:25:30.892
HIRING A TV HAD OVER THAT

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.627
INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS A STANDARD

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.828
IN PLACE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:34.829
AND THEN THIS DECISION COMES

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.231
DOWN AND OVERNIGHT THE STANDARD

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.098
IS CHANGED.

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.267
WITHOUT A LOT OF NOTICE TO

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:41.302
EMPLOYERS WITHOUT A LOT TO CLEAN

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:42.937
THE SHIFT.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:44.372
THE ABC TEST I'M NOT GONNA

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:46.040
ROMANTICIZED BRILLO DECISION I

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:47.275
AGREE WITH THE JUDGE'S COMMENTS

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:48.109
THAT IT CAUSED A LOT OF

01:25:48.176 --> 01:25:49.644
CONFUSION AND LITIGATION FOR

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:51.179
BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES.

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.847
HOWEVER NOW THE A. B. C. TEST IN

01:25:52.914 --> 01:25:54.048
THE RESTRICTIVE NATURE THAT THE

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.083
EMPLOYER COMMUNITY THE

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.384
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:57.151
FACING IT.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.553
BELIEVE IS THAT IT WILL

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.854
ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.222
OPPORTUNITY AND CREATE THE SAME

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.524
AMOUNT OF LITIGATION OBVIOUSLY

01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:04.158
BE A FACTOR FOCUSES ON THE RIGHT

01:26:04.225 --> 01:26:05.093
TO CONTROL WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.060
THAT THE ROLE OF FACTOR

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:07.228
OBVIOUSLY ARBELLA FACTORS

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.730
OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON THE B.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:09.764
FACTOR.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.533
THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.034
THAT THIS IS THE MAIN

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.168
DISTINCTION I WOULD SAY BETWEEN

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.270
THE BRELO IN THE A. B. C. YOU

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:17.272
HAVE TO SATISFY ALL THREE OF

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:18.406
THESE FACTORS IF YOU GET TWO OUT

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:19.707
OF THREE IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.743
YOU HAVE TO SATISFY ALL.

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:22.510
THREE AND WELL IN SOME

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.045
CIRCUMSTANCES --

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.847
THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS --

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.282
FOR IT MAY BE QUITE CLEAR FOR

01:26:27.348 --> 01:26:28.349
EXAMPLE --

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:29.484
WE HAVE EXPERTS APPEAR FROM

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.552
OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT IN THE

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:31.486
HEALTH CARE SITUATION IT WOULD

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:32.487
BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:33.955
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING MEDICAL

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.156
SERVICES AT A HOSPITAL TO SAY

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.524
THEY WEREN'T PERFORMING THE

01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.358
USUAL COURSE OF THE HIRING

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:38.059
ENTITY.

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.661
AND UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THEY

01:26:39.727 --> 01:26:40.228
COULD NOT BE AN INDEPENDENT

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:42.130
CONTRACTOR HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:43.197
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE A LOT

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:44.432
MORE GRAY AN AMBIGUOUS OF

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.567
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE WITHIN THE

01:26:45.633 --> 01:26:47.035
USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH I

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.670
THINK IS A CHALLENGE OF WHEN --

01:26:48.736 --> 01:26:49.737
A STANDARD LIKE THIS IS TO

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.439
ADOPTED THROUGH A COURT DECISION

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:51.940
RATHER THAN THROUGH THE

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.308
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS YOU DON'T

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.776
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DEFINING THE

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:56.210
FULL SCOPE OF WHAT THAT FACTOR

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:56.744
IS.

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:59.681
IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT UPON

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.183
HOW RISK OF DETERMINING WHETHER

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.251
OR NOT THEY FALL WITHIN THE

01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:04.919
USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THE

01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:06.387
LIABILITIES SIGNIFICANT YOU

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:07.555
HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL ALL

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:08.957
OF THE WAGE AND HOUR ISSUES THAT

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:10.258
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.426
UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES THE WORKERS

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:12.827
COMPENSATION INSURANCE.

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:13.962
THAT'S ALL BAR BORN BY THE

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.097
HIRING ENTITY IF THEY FAIL TO

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.799
CLASSIFY AN INDIVIDUAL CORRECTLY

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:18.967
AND SO WE WILL BE A LOSS OF

01:27:19.033 --> 01:27:21.302
INTEREST IN A OPPORTUNITIES.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:22.437
FOR MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:23.805
ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.506
RIGHT NOW AND WHO DEPEND ON THAT

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:27.575
AS THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCE --

01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:28.009
WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.477
PROFESSIONALS I WANT TO DRUM TO

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:30.979
THAT ISSUE WITH REGARDS THE WAGE

01:27:31.045 --> 01:27:33.381
ORDERS THE IDA OR NOTION --

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:35.016
AND I AGREED THAT THIS WAS ONLY

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:35.883
A BASED UPON WAIT ORDERS WE'D

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:37.385
ORDERS WHICH BY THE WAY HAVE NOT

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:39.487
BEEN UPDATED REVISED OR REVIEWED

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:41.122
FOR UP OVER FOURTEEN YEARS THAT

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.457
WITH THE I. W. C. WAS DEFENDED

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:43.758
IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO WE HAVE

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:44.592
WAGE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:45.627
REVIEWED.

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.561
UPON WHICH THIS DECISION IS

01:27:46.628 --> 01:27:48.229
BASED AND THE NOTION THAT THIS

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:49.697
IS ONLY GOING TO BE APPLICABLE

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:50.698
TO WAIT ORDERS I THINK IT'S

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.166
REALLY IFFICULT AND CHALLENGING

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.434
FROM THE EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE.

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:55.436
THERE SO MUCH CROSSOVER BETWEEN

01:27:55.503 --> 01:27:56.638
THE WAGE ORDERS AND THE LABOR

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:58.072
CODE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.140
FOR AN EMPLOYER TO SIT THERE AND

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:00.441
TELL AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW WHAT

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:01.843
FOR THE WAGE ORDERS WE'RE GOING

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:03.244
TO TREAT YOU AS AN INDEPENDENT

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:04.445
CONTRACTOR AN EMPLOYEE.

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:05.947
AND FOR THE LABOR CODE VICE

01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.015
VERSA IT'S JUST AN IMPOSSIBLE

01:28:07.081 --> 01:28:08.616
SITUATION THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:09.884
GOING TO HAPPEN I ALSO

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:11.486
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THE

01:28:11.552 --> 01:28:13.254
PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EXEMPTS

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:14.455
UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS ARE

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.723
THEREFORE NOT.

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:16.491
IMPACTED BY THE DYNAMICS

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.426
DECISION EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:19.861
WAGE ORDERS ARE ONLY FOR CERTAIN

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.362
SECTIONS OF THOSE WAIT ORDERS

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:22.997
IT'S OVERTIME MINIMUM WAGE A

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:23.865
REST BREAKS IN MIL BREAKS

01:28:23.931 --> 01:28:24.699
MEANING YOU'RE A SALARIED

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:25.900
EMPLOYEE.

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:26.567
AND SO YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM THOSE

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.603
PROVISIONS THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:30.138
FROM THE ENTIRE WAGE ORDER AND

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.506
THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THE

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:33.441
DEFINITION TO SUFFER OR PERMIT

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.542
WHICH IS THE WHOLE DEFINITION

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.910
THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE DYNAMICS

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.311
DECISION BASICALLY.

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:38.579
BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO WHETHER

01:28:38.646 --> 01:28:39.347
OR NOT THEY'RE A SALARIED

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:40.782
EMPLOYEE YOU HAVE TO FIRST MAKE

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:41.783
THE DISTINCTION OF WHETHER OR

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.817
NOT THEY'RE AN INDEPENDENT

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.252
CONTRACTOR AND EMPLOYEE AND

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:45.586
THAT'S THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:46.754
SO ALL OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS

01:28:46.821 --> 01:28:47.889
WHO MAY.

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:49.424
BE EXEMPTS IF THEY'RE DETERMINED

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.091
TO BE AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THE WAGE

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.726
ORDERS MAY NOT EVER GET THERE

01:28:51.793 --> 01:28:53.394
BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.429
MAKE THAT AT NATIONAL

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.297
DETERMINATION BETWEEN ABC.

01:28:56.364 --> 01:29:01.035
AND THE DEPEND CONTRACTORS MY

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:02.270
TIME READY UP CHEESE AGO I

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:03.905
PROMISE OKAY.

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:06.607
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ASSEMBLY

01:29:06.674 --> 01:29:07.875
MEMBER GONZALEZ BECAUSE I DO

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:09.010
BELIEVE THAT WITH THE RISK OF

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:09.977
LIABILITY IN KIND OF THE STRICT

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.379
NATURE SOME THE WAGE AND HOUR

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.914
LAWS IN CALIFORNIA IT DOES

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.082
LIMóN AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:15.283
GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THOSE

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.184
INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS WHY

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.485
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WANT TO

01:29:17.552 --> 01:29:17.885
MAINTAIN.

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.187
IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.722
EMPLOYER JUST TO SAY SHOW UP

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:21.622
WHENEVER YOU WANT YOU CAN LEAVE

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:22.890
WITH AN EVER YOU WANT AND STILL

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:24.225
MAINTAIN THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.393
IN THEIR BUSINESS.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.027
LAST AND FINAL POINT THAT I WANT

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:26.994

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:28.429
BUT NOBODY HAS ADDRESSED YET IS

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:29.864
RETROACTIVITY THE COURT WHEN IT

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:31.332
ISSUED ITS DECISION TO NOT JUST

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:32.567
SPECIFIED THT THIS IS ON A

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:33.835
PROSPECTIVE BASIS ACTUALLY

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:34.936
OPENED UP THE DOOR THAT THIS

01:29:35.002 --> 01:29:35.837
COULD BE APPLIED ON A

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.038
RETROACTIVE BASIS.

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.439
AND I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY AND

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.441
PATENTLY UNFAIR FOR A BUSINESS

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:41.776
TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR A

NEVER APPEARED BEFORE IN ANY

STATE STATUTE.

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:47.548

OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:54.155

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:54.315
NOT IF WE OFFER BENEFITS TO

THEY DON'T WANT A LONGER DRIVE

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:22.830

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:23.698

CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR LAW

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:50.858
THERE ARE MANY INHIBITORS TO

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:51.859
COMPANIES BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.394
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WHILE ALSO

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.562
MAINTAINING THE INDEPENDENT

CONTRACTOR STATUS OF WORKERS.

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:58.065
THIS IS WHY WE SUPPORT REFORMS

01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.600
TO MODERNIZE EMPLOYMENT LAW

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:00.968

MANY OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LAW

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:13.240

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:27.121
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:28.823
BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:31.158
EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE CANNOT

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:34.195
BE EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS.

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.396
I'M.

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.664
HOW WE ARE ORGANIZED IS MERCY

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.132
FISSIONS FORM TOGETHER AND

THE MERGER DEPARTMENT REGARDLESS

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.626
OF WHAT INSURANCE THEY HAVE OR

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:06.727
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

THOSE ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS FOR

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:09.964

BUSINESS A WORKER SIDE IT'S VERY

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.872
COMMON FOR EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS

AS A WORKER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:21.175
CONTRACTOR.

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.977

PROFESSIONALS PARTICULARLY

01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:48.068

WHICH IS RESOURCES AND

01:36:49.503 --> 01:36:51.305
BARGAINING POWER TO BEING HIGHER

THE BENEFITS THAT YOU COMMONLY

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.247
RELATIONSHIP --

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:01.081
ON THE BARGAINING POWER

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:02.983
PERSPECTIVE AS WE ALL KNOW THERE

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.018
IS A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.286
CALIFORNIA.

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:06.654
ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE REALITIES

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:08.022
THAT GIVES PHYSICIANS SOME

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:09.690
BARGAINING POWER SO THEY'RE IN A

01:37:09.757 --> 01:37:11.125
POSITION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:12.893
THAT CHOICE ON WHERE THEY WANT

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.627
TO WORK.

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:15.296
A GOING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:16.630
MODELED AND ANOTHER UNIQUE

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:17.798
ASPECT IS.

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:56.650
UNDER AGENCY LAW THE AGENT IS IN

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:58.352
FACT THE COMPANY --

01:40:58.419 --> 01:41:01.121
THEY ARE ABLE TO BIND COVERAGE --

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:02.389
EVEN THOUGH THE AGENT OR BROKER

01:41:02.456 --> 01:41:04.358
HAS THEIR OWN INSURANCE ARE

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:06.627
OWNED BY THEIR BOND IF THE IF

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:08.095
THERE'S MALFEASANCE THE LAWYERS

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.263
GOING TO SELL THROUGH THE

01:41:09.329 --> 01:41:10.664
INSURANCE AGENT.

SITUATION AND FOR THAT THOSE

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:16.870
REASONS WE STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE

01:41:16.937 --> 01:41:18.005
NEED TO HAVE.

01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.607
SOME CLARIFICATION FROM --

01:41:20.674 --> 01:41:22.409
THE DYNAMICS DECISION --

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:24.144
WE WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.446
DEVELOP LANGUAGE ON THAT POINT

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:28.582
SINCE OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR WE'VE

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:29.016
HAD.

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.552
DISCUSSIONS WITH ORGANIZED LABOR

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:32.619

LEGISLATORS ON THIS ON THIS

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:36.290
ISSUE -- I

01:41:36.957 --> 01:41:37.324
WITH.

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:38.892

DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING VERY WELL --

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:44.465
DO SUBJECT TO SEEING LANGUAGE

01:41:44.531 --> 01:41:45.432
AND THAT'S EVERYTHING WHICH WE

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:46.433
HAVEN'T SEEN YET THAT

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.035
CONCEPTUALLY WE THINK --

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:50.270
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:53.974
IS -- IS --

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:58.645

SALES MECHANISM SO WE LOOK

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.519
FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:07.187
DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE OF THIS

DOCTOR TO GET WORKERS INTO A

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:21.602
MAGIC IT DEMONSTRATES OR THE

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:22.936
COMPLEXITY.

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:24.137
OF THE ISSUE BUT I ALSO

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:26.406

PEOPLE AT LEAST ARE ARE TALKING

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.177
TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE WE NEED

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:32.012
TO ON AN ISSUE OF THIS.

01:42:32.079 --> 01:42:33.814
NATURE NO DOUBT ABOUT AND I HAVE

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:36.817
A COUPLE QUESTIONS OR I HANDED

01:42:36.884 --> 01:42:40.554
OVER.

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:42.022
I'M.

01:42:42.089 --> 01:42:43.423
AND SO.

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.260
MISTER JENSEN --

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.195
BUT BE BE HEARD THE THE PANEL

01:42:48.262 --> 01:42:51.365
BEFORE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF A I

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:52.533
THINK GHOST FASHIONABLE WAS

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:53.800
TALKING ABOUT WILD.

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.269
FREEDOM AND COMPLYING WITH

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:57.070
WEIGHT ORDERS ARE TWO DIFFERENT

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.206
THINGS WE DON'T FLEXIBILITY A

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:00.307
COMBINED WAGE ORDERS ARE.

01:43:00.374 --> 01:43:04.811
FROM TWO SEPARATE THINGS YOU SEE.

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:05.879
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND AND I

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.481
GUESS I I GUESS THE POINT IS

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:08.982
THAT IF IF THE WAGE ORDER

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:09.683
REQUIRES.

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:11.418
BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS ABOUT

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:12.185
CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES NO

01:43:12.252 --> 01:43:13.654
MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME WHAT

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:17.357
HAVE YOU.

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:17.925
WHO WOULD?

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:18.892
WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.827
COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN THE

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:21.228
BUSINESS MODEL --

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:23.597
THAT PLAYERS --

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:25.766
THEM EMPLOY.

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:28.101
THERE'S THE DRIVERS THAT

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.436
DELIVERY OR WHAT HAVE YOU

01:43:29.503 --> 01:43:29.736
[inaudible]

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:31.605
SO.

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:32.472
SO -- I'LL

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:33.073
START OFF BY SAYING YOU KNOW

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:34.441
CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING AND SO

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:36.043
WERE CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:38.011
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:39.279
THIS --

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.248
ISSUE AND ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.250
PIECES OF BENEFITS SO LIKE CHEN

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:43.917
MENTION LIKE WORKING IN A WAGE

01:43:43.984 --> 01:43:45.886
ORDERS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF IT

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:47.020
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER PIECES

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:48.188
THAT NEED TO BE.

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:48.956
HASHED OUT BETWEEN DIFFERENT

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:51.224
PIECES OF LAW AND SO WHAT WE

01:43:51.291 --> 01:43:52.726
BELIEVE IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE

01:43:52.793 --> 01:43:54.895
WE WANT FLEXIBILITY AND

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:55.729
STABILITY AND SO HOW DO WE GET

01:43:55.796 --> 01:43:56.930
THERE -- AND

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.465
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DO

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.566
SO IN A WAY THAT THESE

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.301
BUSINESSES CAN KEEP PROVIDING

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:03.637
THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEIR

01:44:03.704 --> 01:44:05.472
WORKERS HAVE TODAY --

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:08.408
AND THE THE ABILITY FOR

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:10.310
CONSUMERS TO USE THESE PRODUCTS

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:11.612
AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:12.779
STILL CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:14.848
THAT PROCESS AND CONTINUING TO

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:15.449
WORK WITH OUR MEMBER COMPANIES

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:16.717
TO GET THERE --

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.151
AND THEY ARE WORKING AND DOING

01:44:18.218 --> 01:44:20.087
REALLY HARD WORK WITH --

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:21.021
ORGANIZED LABOR TO FIGURE THAT

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.322
OUT -- BUT

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:24.057
WE DO BELIEVE THAT FLEXIBILITY

01:44:24.124 --> 01:44:25.759
AND STABILITY CAN BE

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:27.661
ACCOMPLISHED --

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:29.096
AND SO WE'RE WE'RE JUST TRYING

01:44:29.162 --> 01:44:29.563
TO GET THAT OF THE THE

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:33.300
FLEXIBILITY BUT ALSO I MEAN

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:33.900
HAVING THE BARE MINIMUM MAKING

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:37.104
SURE THAT.

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.639
YEAH AS I A CASE.

01:44:38.705 --> 01:44:39.773
HAS AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE AT

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.440
LEAST -- HAS

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.375
THEIR WORKING EX NUMBER HOURS

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:43.010
THAT THEY GET COMPENSATED AT

01:44:43.076 --> 01:44:45.679
LEAST TO MEET THE THE LAW AND AS

01:44:45.746 --> 01:44:47.414
IT APPLIES THE WAGE ORDERS.

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:48.515
SO I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:50.984
SPECIFIC PIECES OF ME AND HIM

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.719
AND AND I'VE I'M UP HERE

01:44:52.786 --> 01:44:53.987
REPRESENTING OUR ASSOCIATION AND

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:55.255
NOT OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SO

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:56.590
THAT YES YEAH WE'RE WORKING

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.225
THROUGH ALL THOSE ISSUES --

01:44:58.291 --> 01:44:59.693
BUT WHAT I SAID IN THE BEGINNING

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.794
AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T BELIEVE

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:02.596
IT'S YOU KNOW IF WE PROVIDE

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:04.364
BENEFITS IT'S HOW WE PROVIDE

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:05.532
THOSE BENEFITS AND SO THERE'S A

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.534
LOT OF DEVIL IN THE DETAILS THE

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:09.302
ORDER CONTAINED WORK OUT THAT I

01:45:09.369 --> 01:45:10.303
DON'T MEAN.

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:11.204
TO YEAH ACCOUNTS REPRESENT A

01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:11.905
TRAIN STATION --

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.373
INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES BUT AND AND

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:15.242
THEN -- MISS

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:18.345
BARRERA IS.

01:45:18.412 --> 01:45:24.685
AS THE THE CASE THE DYNAMICS

01:45:24.751 --> 01:45:26.053
CASE AS A APPLIES TO WAGE ORDERS

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.721
THE INDICATED THAT --

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:28.822
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CROSSOVER

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:29.990
LABOR CODE WHAT HAVE YOU NOW IS

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:30.190
THAT.

01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:31.491
A CROSSOVER DRUGS A PRACTICAL

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.493
APPLICATION OR IS IT A CONCERN

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.628
THAT THE COURTS WILL.

01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:35.362
THAT IT'LL BE IN TROUBLE IN A

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:38.999
MORE EXPANSIVE VIEW EITHER BUT

01:45:39.066 --> 01:45:41.334
INTERPRETING DYNAMICS OR

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.437
SUBSEQUENT.

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:44.504
NO COURT RULINGS THAT MAY

01:45:44.571 --> 01:45:45.172
EXPANDED SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.707
BE PREPARED. FOR THAT CROSSOVER

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.908
YEAH I'M I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:48.709
BIT OF BOTH --

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:49.643
I KNOW THERE IS A DECISION THAT

01:45:49.710 --> 01:45:50.644
SAID HEY THE DYNAMICS DECISION

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:51.778
WAS ONLY APPLICABLE TO WAIT

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.146
ORDERS AND NOT LABOR CO CLAIMS

01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:54.314
IN CERTAINLY WITH THAT CASE

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:55.649
ITSELF BASE BUT THE LABOR CO

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:56.550
CLAIMS AND THE WAGE ORDER CLAIMS.

01:45:56.616 --> 01:45:58.051
HOWEVER I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

01:45:58.118 --> 01:45:58.685
OF HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO

01:45:58.752 --> 01:46:01.021
CROSS OVER THERE'S A PROVISION

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.255
THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO REIMBURSE

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:03.690
FOR TOOLS IN UNIFORM AND UNDER

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:04.925
THE LABOR CODE IT SAYS THAT YOU

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:06.026
HAVE TO REIMBURSE FOR ALL

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:07.861
EMPLOYEE RELATED EXPENSES.

01:46:07.928 --> 01:46:10.263
SO IF I BRING A CLAIM --

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:11.798
AND TOOLS UNIFORMED EQUIPMENT

01:46:11.865 --> 01:46:13.066
SKEWS ME UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:15.535
IF I BRING A CLAIM UNDER BOTH.

01:46:15.602 --> 01:46:17.170
YOU KNOW RIGHT FOR THE SAME

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:18.605
EXPENSE AND I AL ALLEGE A CLAIM

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:19.840
UNDER THE LABOR CODE PROVISION

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:21.174
FOR MY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AND

01:46:21.241 --> 01:46:22.476
ONE UNDER THE WAGE ORDER WHAT IS

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:23.910
A CAR GOING TO DO WITH THAT.

01:46:23.977 --> 01:46:24.811
AND ARE YOU GOING TO BASICALLY

01:46:24.878 --> 01:46:26.046
DENIED THE CLAIM UNDER THE LABOR

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.814
CODE AND SAY UNDER THE BROILER

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:29.382
FACTORS YOUR INDEPENDENT

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:31.218
CONTRACTOR BUT ON THE WAGE ORDER

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:33.587
YOUR A AN EMPLOYEE AND WHAT I

01:46:33.653 --> 01:46:35.088
MEAN HONESTLY WHAT IS THE

01:46:35.155 --> 01:46:36.690
DISTINCTION IN REALITY.

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:38.058
MATTER TO SOME EXTENT RIGHT

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:40.160
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME CLAIM IS

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:41.495
JUST BEING ALLEGED UNDER A

01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:43.196
DIFFERENT PROVISION AND AGAIN --

01:46:43.263 --> 01:46:44.431
WITH YOUR AN EMPLOYEE UNDER ONE

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:45.599
AND NOT INTO THE OTHER IT REALLY

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.033
DOESN'T HAVE ANY ACTUAL.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.168
RESULT THAT'S MEANINGFUL AND

01:46:48.235 --> 01:46:50.403
DISTINCT AND SO I THINK IT WOULD

AND THAT IS WHAT THE COURT IN

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:22.255
DYNAMAX SAYS IS NOT OKAY THE

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:23.823
THAT KIND OF A COMPANY SHOULD BE

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:25.224
AN EMPLOYER.

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:26.092

NOTHING A TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.370

I THOUGHT ABOUT MY OWN LIFE

HAVING BEEN AN EMPLOYEE NOW AT

IN THAT TIME I'VE HAD TWO

02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.909
THAT'S BECAUSE AS AN EMPLOYEE I

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:51.911

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:53.439
TODAY.

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:55.441
THE CHOICES WE MAKE HERE WILL

02:06:55.507 --> 02:06:56.542
DETERMINE WHETHER FUTURE

THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE WORKERS

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:07.686
NEEDED TO ORGANIZE SO THEY COULD

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:08.821
HAVE EQUAL POWER.

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:10.556
SO UNDER RELENTLESS PRESSURE

02:07:10.622 --> 02:07:12.758
FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN

GOVERNMENT DEREGULATED TRUCKING.

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:17.830
AT THAT TIME THE NATIONAL MASTER

02:07:17.896 --> 02:07:20.432
FREIGHT AGREEMENT COVERED

02:07:20.499 --> 02:07:21.934
NINETEEN THOUSAND COMPANIES AND

02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:23.035
90% OF THE INDUSTRY WAS

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:25.504
UNIONIZED.

02:07:25.571 --> 02:07:28.407
IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ALMOST

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:29.008
SEVEN THOUSAND COMPANIES WENT

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:30.376
BANKRUPT.

02:07:30.442 --> 02:07:33.078
WITHIN TEN YEARS NEARLY FIVE

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:34.446
HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS LOST

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:36.148
THEIR JOBS.

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:37.750
TODAY WE ONLY HAVE THREE

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:40.486

02:07:40.552 --> 02:07:41.887
THOUSAND WORKERS LEFT UNDER

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:43.322
NATIONAL FREIGHT AGREEMENTS.

02:07:43.389 --> 02:07:46.692
SO WHAT HAPPENED. TWO WORDS

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:49.261
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING.

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.230
OUT OF THE ASHES OF DEREGULATION

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:53.298
THIS BUSINESS MODEL CAME TO

02:07:53.365 --> 02:07:55.334
DOMINATE TRACKING LEADING TO A

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:57.636
REDUCTION IN WORKER POWER WAGES

02:07:57.703 --> 02:07:59.471
IN THE DECLINE OF A ONCE MIDDLE

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:01.240
CLASS OCCUPATION.

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.142
DEREGULATION HAS BEEN WILDLY

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:05.177
SUCCESSFUL FOR BIG BUSINESS

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:07.846
ALLOWING LARGE COMPANIES TO PAY

02:08:07.913 --> 02:08:09.148
MUCH LESS TO MOVE GOODS.

02:08:09.214 --> 02:08:10.816
THOSE COST SAVINGS HAVE COME

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:12.584
FROM A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AS

02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:15.788
COMPANIES CUT WAGES ALMOST 50%

02:08:15.854 --> 02:08:18.857
SINCE DEREGULATION.

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.559
NOW DRIVING A TRUCK FOR MOST HAS

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.861
BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SWEATSHOP ON

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:25.464
WHEELS DRIVERS WORK SIXTY TO A

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:27.166
HUNDRED HOURS PER WEEK MAKE LESS

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:29.835
THAN MINIMUM WAGE AFTER EXPENSES

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:31.103
HAVE NO WORKERS COMP AND NO

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:32.905
BENEFITS.

02:08:32.971 --> 02:08:34.206
SHIFTED THE COST OF BUYING

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:36.375
OPERATING AND MAINTAINING TRUCKS

02:08:36.442 --> 02:08:37.810
ON TO THE BACKS OF THOSE LEAST

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:39.545
EQUIPPED TO DO IT.

02:08:39.611 --> 02:08:41.480
AND THIS COMPROMISES OUR ABILITY

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:43.015
TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:44.416
DRIVERS CAN NOT AFFORD TO BUY

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:47.219
CLEAN TRUCKS.

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:48.787
COURSE THEY HAVE LITTLE RECOURSE

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.722
TO DO ANYTHING UNDER LIES

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:52.658
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BECAUSE

02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:55.561
THEY CANNOT ORGANIZE A UNION.

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:57.296
I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA

02:08:57.362 --> 02:08:58.864
HAS DONE MORE TO ADDRESS MISS

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.632
CLASSIFICATION IN TRUCKING THAN

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:02.167
ANY STATE.

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:03.735
AND SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN PORT

02:09:03.802 --> 02:09:05.304

ALMOST HALF OF THOSE OF LEAD THE

IN FACT EMPLOYEES.

GENERAL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE

02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:40.726
WE WORK WITH MANY EMPLOYERS ARE

02:11:40.792 --> 02:11:42.561

BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT THIS

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:56.408
THAT THESE SECTORS OF THE

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:39.751
THERE ARE ANY UNION AND I WOULD

02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:41.519
SAY NOT THAT'S NOT ONLY THE CASE.

02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:42.887
FOR US AS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:45.056
FEDERATION NATIONWIDE I THINK

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.292
THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:48.693
PRESSING ISSUES FOR THE LABOR

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:50.095
MOVEMENT EVERY STATE IN THE

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:51.229
COUNTRY YOU HAVE UNIONS

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.631
GRAPPLING WITH.

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:53.398
HOW DO WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE

02:17:53.465 --> 02:17:55.900
CLASS HOW DO WE TAKE ON OF THE

02:17:55.967 --> 02:17:58.103
GROWTH IN SUBCONTRACTED WORK IN

02:17:58.169 --> 02:17:59.371
IN IN THE USE OF INDEPENDENT

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:01.373
CONTRACTORS IN COMPANIES REALLY

02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:02.440
TRYING TO SAY?

02:18:02.507 --> 02:18:03.808
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:05.277
OBLIGATION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO

02:18:05.343 --> 02:18:06.845
THE WORK OF MY COMPANY THAT'S

02:18:06.911 --> 02:18:08.046
THE TREND THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR

02:18:08.113 --> 02:18:09.714
THE LAST FEW DECADES AND I THINK

02:18:09.781 --> 02:18:11.182
AS A LABOR MOVEMENT THAT IS THE

02:18:11.249 --> 02:18:13.752
NUMBER ONE MOST IMPORTANT THING

02:18:13.818 --> 02:18:14.619
FOR US TO ADDRESS [inaudible]

02:18:14.686 --> 02:18:16.588
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:19.124
ANY.

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.759
DECEMBER IS ALSO TO QUESTIONS

02:18:20.825 --> 02:18:21.993
ONE JUST A FOLLOW UP AND IT IT'S

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:22.861
TRUE RIGHT THAT IF WITHOUT BEING

02:18:22.927 --> 02:18:24.829
EMPLOYEES A WORKER HAS NO RIGHT

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:26.531
TO ORGANIZE AND BILL AND POWER

02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:28.133
THEMSELVES HAVE A VOICE ON THE

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:28.333
JOB.

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:28.967
THAT'S RIGHT SO I MEAN I DON'T

02:18:29.034 --> 02:18:31.102
WANT PEOPLE TO SUGGEST THAT WE

02:18:31.169 --> 02:18:32.971
DON'T WANT MORE UNION MEMBERS WE

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:35.440
ABSOLUTELY DO AND I I THINK

02:18:35.507 --> 02:18:37.208
THAT'S BECAUSE WE THOSE OF US

02:18:37.275 --> 02:18:38.276
WHO HAVE COME FROM ORGANIZED

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:39.678
LABOR KNOWS.

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:43.481
IF YOU DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT

02:18:43.548 --> 02:18:45.116
PLACE THAN HAVE A UNION CONTRACT

02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:47.118
BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T NEED THEM

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:48.253
TO BE -- IF

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:49.287
YOU DON'T WANT LAWSUITS THERE'S

02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:50.455
A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT

02:18:50.522 --> 02:18:51.189
THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE

02:18:51.256 --> 02:18:52.891
EMPLOYER BUT I I WANT TO BE VERY

02:18:52.957 --> 02:18:53.758
TRANSPARENT.

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:56.061
I I ABSOLUTELY THINK ONE OF THE

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:58.396
REASONS I I IN LIKE DYNAMAX IN

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:00.065
LIKE THREE CLASSIFICATION OF

02:19:00.131 --> 02:19:01.766
EMPLOYEES CORRECTLY IS THAT THEY

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:04.135
HAVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL FIRST

02:19:04.202 --> 02:19:06.104
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO ORGANIZE --

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.138
IN THE WORKPLACE.

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:09.874
WELL IN FACT I DON'T THINK

02:19:09.941 --> 02:19:11.209
ANYBODY SAID THAT.

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:13.144
THE EIGHTEEN NINETY SHERMAN ANTI

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.780
TRUST ACT WAS ESTABLISHED TO

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.749
PREVENT CORPORATE MONOPOLIES.

02:19:17.816 --> 02:19:21.186
AND THOSE ARE THE SAME LAWS THAT

02:19:21.252 --> 02:19:22.921
ARE USED WHEN IMMIGRANT WORKERS

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:24.289
WHO ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS

02:19:24.355 --> 02:19:26.291
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TRY TO

02:19:26.357 --> 02:19:28.727
COME TOGETHER. TO DO SOMETHING

02:19:28.793 --> 02:19:30.795
TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC LOT IN

02:19:30.862 --> 02:19:32.297
LIFE.

02:19:32.363 --> 02:19:34.599
SO IT IS A PERVERSE

02:19:34.666 --> 02:19:37.368
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IN MY

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:38.236
OPINION.

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:39.204
THANK YOU AND THEN I HAVE ONE

02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.105
ADDITIONAL QUESTION AND YOU MAY

02:19:40.171 --> 02:19:41.806
NOT HAVE THE ANSWER TO FIND IT I

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:42.707
JUST REALIZED AS YOU WERE

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:43.708
SPEAKING --

02:19:43.775 --> 02:19:44.442
ALL OF YOU ESPECIALLY IN

02:19:44.509 --> 02:19:46.111
CONSTRUCTION AND JANITORIAL DO

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:49.581
WE KNOW OF I GUESS THE THE I

02:19:49.647 --> 02:19:50.582
GUESS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE LABOR

02:19:50.648 --> 02:19:52.183
COMMISSIONER NUMBERS OF OF FOUND

02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:53.818
MISS CLASSIFICATIONS HOW THE

02:19:53.885 --> 02:19:55.653
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THAT IT

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:58.323
HAPPENED BE LATINO WORKERS.

02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:59.624
I CAN SAY THE JANITORIAL

02:19:59.691 --> 02:20:00.825
INDUSTRY IT'S ALL AT THE NO

02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:03.194
WORKERS AND PREDOMINATELY WOMEN

02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:04.829
ON BECAUSE THE GENERAL INDUSTRY

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:06.331
IS ABOUT 6265%.

02:20:06.397 --> 02:20:07.632
WOMEN EMPLOYED.

02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:09.300
AND SO YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS ARE

02:20:09.367 --> 02:20:11.202
USUALLY SPANISH SPEAKING

02:20:11.269 --> 02:20:12.403
IMMIGRANTS WITH.

02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:16.641
STATUS QUESTIONS AND THEN AS FOR

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:18.510
IS THAT CONSTANT CHURN WILL SAY

02:20:18.576 --> 02:20:19.511
TO THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND

02:20:19.577 --> 02:20:20.979
EXPLOITATION AROUND THAT AROUND

02:20:21.045 --> 02:20:22.380
THOSE VULNERABILITIES AND EVEN

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:23.281
IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IT'S A

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:24.716
GROWING --

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.951
PERCENTAGE OF IT'S WORKERS YOU

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:28.319
GO DOWN TO THE PORTS IT'S THE

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:30.255
UNITED NATIONS DOWN THERE

02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:32.590
IMMIGRANTS FROM EVERY COUNTRY IN

02:20:32.657 --> 02:20:35.827
THE WORLD. FOR CONSTRUCTION AND

02:20:35.894 --> 02:20:37.495
MOST OF OUR PREMISES ARE LATINOS

02:20:37.562 --> 02:20:39.531
AND IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION

02:20:39.597 --> 02:20:42.100
ALSO MOST OF THE CONSTRUCTION

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:45.136
WORKS ON THE THING IS A SMALL.

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:47.839
VICE CHAIR.

02:20:47.906 --> 02:20:49.440
FOR WELL GOOD MORNING AND IT'S

02:20:49.507 --> 02:20:50.441
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE CARE

02:20:50.508 --> 02:20:51.643
THINGS WERE PUT THIS ON AND

02:20:51.709 --> 02:20:53.011
THERE'S BEEN A LOT DISCUSSED

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:53.945
TODAY AND ACTUALLY THROUGH THE

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:55.747
LAST WITNESS FOR FIVE MONTHS ON

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:56.181
THIS --

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:58.183
ISSUE AND EVEN GOING INTO LAST

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.150
YEAR AND I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:00.785
MAKING A TREMENDOUS PROGRESS I

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:02.353
APPLAUD EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS BOTH

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:03.488
LABOR BUSINESS MEETING COMING

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:05.490
TOGETHER. TO TO WORK ON THIS --

02:21:05.557 --> 02:21:06.624
ISSUE BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S

02:21:06.691 --> 02:21:08.226
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ECONOMY OF

02:21:08.293 --> 02:21:09.427
CALIFORNIA THAT WE GET THIS

02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:10.962
FIXED AND GET IT FIXED PROPERLY

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:11.996
AND SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:13.531
WORK THAT'S BEING PUT IN.

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:14.465
I DO -- HAVE

02:21:14.532 --> 02:21:14.966
A FEW --

02:21:15.033 --> 02:21:17.235
CONCERNS --

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:18.469
WITH THIS AND HAS.

02:21:18.536 --> 02:21:19.938
MORE DO WITH THE SMALL GUY.

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:21.139
MORE TO DO WITH IT THE THE

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:21.873
INDIVIDUALS --

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.308
FROM MY COMMUNITY.

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:24.609
A LOT OF THE GROUPS WE TALK

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:25.677
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S RICK REAL

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:27.879
ESTATE AGENTS OR INSURANCE OR ER

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:31.015
DOCTORS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:32.584
TO WORK ON THIS TO FIX IT. TO

02:21:32.650 --> 02:21:33.818
PROTECT THEIR INDUSTRIES AS I

02:21:33.885 --> 02:21:35.186
THINK THEY SHOULD AND I'M

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:36.721
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:37.856
BUT IT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE

02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:39.691
THE SMALL INDIVIDUALS --

02:21:39.757 --> 02:21:40.425
THE GYM OWNERS THE PLOT IS

02:21:40.491 --> 02:21:42.026
STUDIOS THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE

02:21:42.093 --> 02:21:43.161
WHICH I KNOW WE'VE TALKED A

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.662
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:46.030
BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT

02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:47.398
WILL WE FORGET ABOUT THEM.

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.433
WE FORGET ABOUT THEM IN THE

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:49.434
SENSE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY

02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:52.237
GET SUCKED INTO A DECISION --

02:21:52.303 --> 02:21:52.770
THAT'S WE CODIFY HERE THE

02:21:52.837 --> 02:21:55.540
LEGISLATURE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:57.575
HOW TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND THEN

02:21:57.642 --> 02:21:58.776
THEY GET STUCK WITH US.

02:21:58.843 --> 02:22:00.011
AND SO I GUESS --

02:22:00.078 --> 02:22:02.647
IS THERE A WAY THAT IF SOMEBODY

02:22:02.714 --> 02:22:04.082
TRULY WANTED TO BE AN

02:22:04.148 --> 02:22:04.949
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHETHER

02:22:05.016 --> 02:22:06.784
IT'S A A PERSONAL TRAINER AT THE

02:22:06.851 --> 02:22:08.152
GYM YOU KNOW THAT'S RENTING

02:22:08.219 --> 02:22:09.787
SPACE AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY

02:22:09.854 --> 02:22:11.856
CONTROL OUR OWN HOURS AND ALL OF

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:12.190
THOSE THINGS.

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:13.558
IS VERY.

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:14.726
THAT A SYSTEM A WAY THAT IS

02:22:14.792 --> 02:22:16.327
ACCEPTABLE TO THE TO THE LABOR

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:17.962
MOVEMENT IF THEY TRULY WANT TO

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.097
BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACT AND I

02:22:19.163 --> 02:22:20.431
HEARD YOU KNOW LANGUAGE BARRIERS

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:21.733

BACK THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE WE WE

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:24.435
NEED TO FIX THAT.

02:22:24.502 --> 02:22:26.304
SO I MEAN SERVICE THE ET DE THAT

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.039

ARE EDUCATED ON WHAT EXACTLY

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:38.316

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:29.000
I REALLY BELIEVE FAIR

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:31.336
COMPETITION IS THE KEY FOR SMALL

02:23:31.402 --> 02:23:33.771
EMPLOYERS YOU HAVE TO HAVE CLEAR

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:35.840
RULES THAT CAN BE EASILY

02:23:35.907 --> 02:23:37.742
ENFORCED OTHERWISE THE BIG

02:23:37.809 --> 02:23:39.143
COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS GONNA

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.611
FIGURE OUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE HR

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:41.546
PROFESSIONALS AND LAWYERS AND

02:23:41.612 --> 02:23:42.146
EVERYTHING ELSE.

02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:43.348
AND THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:44.983
HOW TO EXPLOIT THE LOOPHOLES AND

02:23:45.049 --> 02:23:46.384
THE LITTLE GUYS ARE GONNA GET

02:23:46.451 --> 02:23:47.518
SCREWED AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:48.753
THE ONES THAT LOSE CONTRACTS AND

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:49.921
LOSE OPPORTUNITIES.

02:23:49.988 --> 02:23:52.757
SO I WOULD START WITH SAYING I

02:23:52.824 --> 02:23:56.294
CAN -- IS IS

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:58.496
INCREDIBLY BENEFICIAL TO SMALL

02:23:58.563 --> 02:24:00.298
EMPLOYERS.

SOME OF THE THE CONVERSATIONS I

02:24:05.036 --> 02:24:06.537

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.945

LEGIONS OF PEOPLE TOO TOUGH TO

02:24:27.825 --> 02:24:28.726
WORK ON THIS.

02:24:28.793 --> 02:24:30.028
