THANK YOU TODAY THE SENATE BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE IS MEETING TO TAKE ACTION ON THE SENATE VERSION OF THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS NOT. A NORMAL YEAR BY ANY MEANS. BEYOND THE BUDGET SHORTFALL THE WE'RE FACING BECAUSE OF THE COLD BUT NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC ANDEMIC. OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE COMMITTEES NORMAL BUDGET PROCESS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. AND LET'S SAY THAT WHILE IT'S AN ABBREVIATED PROCESS. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE COLLEAGUES THE INTEGRITY OF THE REVIEW AND THE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MAINTAINED. I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE INCOME IN THE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND ALL OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE HARD WORK AND COMPLETING THE HEARINGS OVER THE PAST WEEK. I ALSO MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE STAFF FROM BOTH PARTIES AND THE WORK OF BOTH THE LA OLD OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EVERYONE HAS STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE IN A PHENOMENAL WAY. BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING TO TAKE PART. IN THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BUDGET IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT IN THE MIDST OF MANAGING THE CALL BUT NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THE ADMINISTRATION HAD THE DIFFICULT TASK OF DEVELOPING A BUDGET THAT PROTECTED. ALL OF THE BOTTLE SIR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE STATES RESIDENTS RELY UPON. WHILE FACING A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL. THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION PROPOSAL TAKE THE BALANCED APPROACH IN ADDRESSING THIS BUDGET SHORTFALL INCLUDING UTILIZING RESERVES BORROWING TEMPORARY REVENUES EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS FEDERAL FUNDS. AND A TRIGGER MECHANISM. THE PROPOSAL SENATE PLAN USES THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING THE BUDGET PROBLEM WITH A COUPLE OF KEY DIFFERENCES WHICH THE LA ALL WILL FULLY EXPLAINED IN HIS PRESENTATION. WHAT THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE AND TIME IT TAKES TO PREPARE THE BUDGET BILL FOR A VOTE WE ARE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM NEEDING TO FINALIZE A BUDGET THAT BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR THREE ON IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CONSTITUTION DEADLINE OF JUNE FIFTEENTH. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN THAT SHORT TIME. HOWEVER TODAY IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN GETTING THIS CALL SIR. TO THE FEELING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION. AS WE ALL WORK COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER OVER THESE COMING DAYS TO REACH A FINAL AGREEMENT I HOPE THAT THE PROPOSAL AND IDEAS OF THE SENATE PUTS FORWARD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THE BUDGET SHORTFALL IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT MAKE ADDITIONS WORSE FOR ARE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE THAT THE- BUDGET. WILL NOT BE OUR LAST ACTION THIS YEAR. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE CANNOT ADDRESS NOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THROUGH THE SUMMER. THESE INCLUDE CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN AND HOPEFULLY EXPLORING NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE REVENUE TO SUPPORT OUR STATE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE SENATOR NIELSEN TO PROVIDE OPENING REMARKS SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. AS WE ROLLED INTO THIS INSTITUTION IN JANUARY IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD BE A- FAIRLY REASONABLE YEAR THERE WERE EVEN SOME HOPES. NOW THEY HAVE BEEN DASHED AND NOW WE'VE GOT MUCH MORE TO GRAPPLE WITH. ONE OF THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES HAS BEEN THE CONTRACTION OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. THE COLLAPSE OF THE WORK OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES WOULD BE OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS HAS BEEN NOW COLLAPSED IN JUST A FEW HOURS IN ONE COMMITTEE. DOES IT LIMIT THE DEPTH OF SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT THAT WE NORMALLY CAN EXERT. SO THE CALL TO US IS TO BE VIGILANT AS WE REVIEW WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. AND THEN WHERE WE WILL BE GOING AS HIS BUDGET MOVES OUGHT. THAT IS A CHALLENGE. MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS PREVIOUSLY BUT YET IN THIS BUDGET WE WILL BE DEALING WITH NOW ARE SOME MAJOR MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS. THAT REALLY WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE KIND OF SCRUTINY AND REVIEW. THAT THEY WARRANT AND DEMAND. AND WE TRY TO POINT THOSE OUT WHEREVER WE CAN. THE BURDEN IS GREAT. BECAUSE THEY HILL WE HAVE TO CLIMB. IS ALSO GREAT. AS WE PROCEED HERE I WOULD ADMONISHES TO KEEP IN MIND. NOT JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD. BUT THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED. US TO GET BACK ON SOUND FOOTING NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE ECONOMY. AND I WOULD ARGUE HERE YET AGAIN AS BEFORE WHEN WE HAD THE- RECESSION. WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO ADDRESS STRUCTURAL CONCERNS. BUT WE DID QUITE A LOT. IN THAT PART OF IT ACTUALLY WAS ABOUT THE ONLY PART THAT FELT GOOD. IT APPEARS TO ME AND THIS. BUDGET THAT WE'RE MOVING AHEAD WITH NOW. SOME OF THAT GOOD IS GOING TO BE UNDONE. IN OTHER WORDS EXACERBATING OUR STRUCTURAL PROBLEM RATHER THAN FURTHER ALLEVIATING. WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT. THEN IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY ROLLING BACK DECADES. OF CHANGE AND REFORM THAT HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THAT I WILL BE TO SOME DEGREE COMPROMISED I FEAR. IN THE BUDGET BEFORE US. YET AGAIN AS AT OTHER TIMES WHEN WE FACE THESE GREAT CHALLENGES. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER REASONABLY. AND DONE THE BEST WE CAN. IS THAT ALL WE CAN ASK. NO WE SHOULD ASK EVEN MORE OF OURSELVES. AND BE MINDFUL AS WE- DELIBERATE. AND DISCUSS DEBATE AND VOTE. NOT WHAT IS FOR US TOMORROW. MANY THINGS WE WILL BE VOTING ON. WELL AFFECTED GENERATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA. WELL THE HARDEST THINGS FOR US HERE TO DO. WHAT KIND OF A ME NOW ME FIRST SOCIETY ANYMORE GENERALLY. AND THE DEMANDS OF THE PROCESS AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE. DO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ENVISION THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THAT WHICH WE ARE VOTING ON. OR ALTERING. OR DEBATING OR SUPPORTING TODAY. AND I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS. ON THE GRAND CHILDREN TO THE FUTURE. WHERE I WOULD THEN CIRCLE BACK TO THE NEED TO NOT FORGET THE CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS WE'VE DONE TO ASSIST US IN THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. AND LET ME CLOSE ON A NOTE. PROPOSITION ONE THE RAINY DAY FUND. WHAT IS BROADLY OPPOSE. BUT IT GOT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. GOVERNOR BROWN. AND IS SURVIVED THE TIMES IN THIS DONE ITS JOB. THE RAINY DAY FUND HAS SERVED. TO CONSTRAIN A BIT. LEGISLATIVE SPENDING THAT BUILD THE BASE. THAT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I BELIEVE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT.% AND HELPFUL AND THEN THAT WE HAD A RAINY DAY FUND. AS WELL AS ENVISIONED. THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME. HAS BEEN QUESTION. S. WAGED A LITTLE BIT MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT. THE MESSAGE IN THAT IT IS WELL TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE. IT IS WELL TO QUESTION AND LIBERTY STEPS. AND IT IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL NEEDS TO ENSURE FUTURE BUDGET DID NOT BECOME SO IMBALANCED. THOSE pCAPABILITY CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH GLOBALLY RIGHT NOW. NOT SO MUCH. BUT I WELCOME AND THE DELIBERATION WITH YOU. WE HAD A GOOD YEAR END DELIBERATIONS SO FAR TO GET US TO TODAY. AS THE VOTE TODAY LET'S ALSO THINK SIMULTANEOUSLY ABOUT TOMORROW THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR COLLEAGUES WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN THE WORK.

YES. THE COLLEGE LET'S GO AHEAD AND- MOVED TO OUR FIRST DISCUSSION ITEM RELATED TO THE PIECES OF THE SENATE BUDGET FRAMEWORK I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE LA- ON WHO ALL WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. FOR THE FIRST ITEM ARE LA- MR PANIC IS GOING TO BEGIN AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN AND HOW THEY DIFFER FROM THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. WITH THE PET. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THAT I WANTED TO BEGIN JUST BY THANKING YOU AND THE VICE CHAIR AND OTHER SENATORS PER INCLUDING OUR OFFICE IN IN THE HEARING TODAY. AS YOU NOTED WE WERE WE WERE ASKED BY COMMITTEE STAFF TO PRESENT A CROSSWALK BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. AND THE SENATE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE AND OF COURSE WE ARE PLEASED TO DO THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO NOTE FOR EVERYONE'S AS- YOU KNOW OUR OFFICE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PACKAGE SO. TO THE EXTENT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT PARTICULAR PROVISIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BEST POSITION TO RESPOND TO THOSE. AND I WAS HOPING TO PULL UP MY SLIDE PRESENTATION. AND MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE A HARD COPY OF THE LA ALL PRESENTATION AS WELL. OKAY. EIGHT COLLEGES FOR THAT. BY AND- SCREEN OKAY HANNAH. AND THAT IS THAT IS THAT APPEARING PROPERLY OR YES IT IS THANK YOU OKAY OKAY GOOD I APOLOGIZE FOR THE- LATE. OKAY SO SINCE SINCE YOU HAVE COPIES AND IT'S ON THE SCREEN AS WELL. I WILL GO AHEAD AND- MOVE INTO THE INTO THE DECK HERE SO BEGINNING ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THE SLIDES- I WAS GOING TO BEGIN WITH FROM ONE OF THE HIGHER LEVEL WILL REVIEW IT SOME OF THE MAJOR AND MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE IN THE TWO PACKAGES IN PARTICULAR I WOULD COMMENT ON REVENUES BASS LINE SPENDING. AND FEDERAL FUNDING BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THESE AREAS DIFFER IN THE TWO PACKAGES SOME CASES- SO BEGINNING WITH REVENUES- ACTUALLY THIS IS AN AREA WHERE THEY DO PACKAGE OUR PACKAGES ARE ACTUALLY LARGELY SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER- PACKAGES MAKE SIMILAR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT REVENUES AND- INCLUDE. AT THE TOP. THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE MAY IN REVISION TO TEMPORARILY- PRODUCED MORE REVENUE FOR THAT. FOR THE- STATE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- BUT THIS IS DONE BY THE SPENDING THEY USE THAT MOLD NET OPERATING LOSSES BY BUSINESS. BUSINESS TAXPAYERS. X. THREE YEARS AND ALSO BY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TAX CREDITS THAT CAN BE TAKEN BY BUSINESSES FOR THOSE YEARS AS WELL. AND THAT'S ESTIMATED TO AUGMENT THE REVENUE- PICTURE BY ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION. REGARDING SPENDING IT PARTICULARLY IN THE BASELINE. THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE- DIFFERS IN A NOTABLE WAY FROM THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION I THINK THIS SENATE PACKAGE WOULD. LOOK TO OUR ESTIMATES THE LA- ESTIMATES OF CASELOADS BOTH IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN MEDI CAL THE CASELOADS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY ARE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. BUT THE COST PER CASE LOAD IS DIFFERENT AND IN OUR THE ESTIMATES FROM OUR OFFICE ARE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LOWER. THAN WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. IN CAL WORKS THERE'S A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE JUST IN A NUMBER OF CASELOADS OUR OFFICE IS ACTUALLY ESTIMATES THAT. CASE LOADS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WILL BE LOWER THAN WHAT THE NAY REVISION IS BUILT UPON BY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND- CASELOADS. THAT RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR A COST DIFFERENCE IN SO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PLUS THE TWO POINT NINE BILLION. A SUM UP TO THAT THREE POINT SIX BILL AND IN LOWER EXPENDITURES THEN THE BASELINE UNDER THE SENATE PACKAGE. WHEN IT COMES TO FEDERAL FUNDING. THE TWO PACKAGES ARE DIFFERENT IN FUNDAMENTAL WAYS IN FACT THE BASELINE ASSUMPTION AND FOR THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION AND THE BASELINE ASSUMPTION REGARDING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE SENATE PACKAGE DIFFER SUCH THAT IT'S ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO COMPARE THEM YEAH COMPARE THEM UNDER BOTH OF THEIR BASELINE VERSIONS SO WHAT I MEAN IS IN THE MAIL. IN THE NAY REVISION. THE BASELINE IS THAT THERE IS NOT GOING TO EIGHT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FORTHCOMING. AND THAT IS IT IN RECOGNITION OF THAT IN THE LOWER REVENUE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOW FROM THE RECESSION. MAY REVISION WOULD IT INCLUDES ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION AND A REDUCTION IN THE BUDGET. NOW THOSE REDUCTIONS WOULD BE A RESTORED AND TRIGGERED OFF IF THE STATE WERE TO REALIZE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN MILLION OR SO THE FEDERALIST SYSTEMS BY JULY FIRST. THE SENATE PACKAGE ON THE OTHER HAND STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT WE WILL RECEIVE THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AND SO THE BUDGET IS FILLED WITH THAT- RESUMPTION IN IN THE LINE. AND INSTEAD WHAT IT WOULD DO IS IF IT DOES NOT MATERIALIZE IT INCLUDES TRIGGERS THAT WAY TO. OFFSET THE MISSING FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IN THE EVENT THAT THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE BY OCTOBER FIRST. SO RATHER THAN COMPARE THE TWO PACKAGES ON THEIR BASELINE- ASSUMPTIONS I WILL ACTUALLY COMPARE THEM THROUGH THE BALANCE OF MY PRESENTATION IN THIS IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AND IN THE ALTERNATIVE WHERE THERE IS NOT CONDITIONAL FEDERAL. SO MOVES TO THE NEXT PAGE. AND THIS IS WHERE WE DO MOVE INTO THE DISCUSSION ON FEDERAL FUNDING AND I'LL BEGIN WITH THE CASE IN WHICH THERE IS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID FORTHCOMING. IN THIS IN THIS INSTANCE THE MAY REVISION IN THE SENATE PACKAGE ARE BROADLY SIMILAR- THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES ONE BEING THAT THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD WOULD END THE- BUDGET YEAR WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER TOTAL BUDGET RESERVES OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. BUT THEN THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD ALSO REJECTS SOME OF THE NAY REVISION PROPOSALS AND IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME AUGMENTATION THEY'RE NOT IN THE MAYOR. SO SOME OF THE ONES THAT. ARE NOTABLE ARE- THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN COUNTY REALIGNMENT ASSISTANCE. AND THIS IS A- YOU KNOW A RECOGNITION THAT THE COUNTIES ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT. REDUCTION IN REALIGNMENT FUNDING BECAUSE OF HE RECESSION THAT ESTIMATES I BELIEVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION THERE THAT IT BE IT- SEVENTY IN PERCENT REDUCTION IN THOSE REVENUES THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR LOCAL HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. AND THEN FORTY TWO MILLION FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSION IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE EXPANDED TO COVER. I TEN FILERS TAX FILERS. TAKING EARLY THOSE WITH CHILDREN. AGES SIX AND UNDER. NOW IF WE CAN SO THAT'S KIND OF THE FROM THE NOTABLE WAYS IN WHICH THEY DIFFER IF WE DO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING BUT THAT ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SHORT LIST WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE THIS IS THE TWO PACKAGES ARE REALLY QUITE DIFFERENT WHEN WE GO TO THE OTHER SCENARIO WHERE THERE IS NOT. FEDERAL BEING FORTHCOMING SO FOR ALL MOVE NOW. THE BEGINNING WITH REVENUES IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOT IN RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID THE NAY REVISION DOES NOT REALLY PROPOSING NEED ADDITIONAL. REVENUE INCREASES THAT WOULD BE CONTINGENT ON WHETHER OR NOT WE GET THAT THAT REALLY SO WE JUST GO AT WITH THE REVENUE BASE AS IT. IS SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX FOR THE NCO TAX AND IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THAT WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT ONE BILLION A GENERAL FUND STATE. I'M THE CHANGE. THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE TAX SEEMS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CMS GUIDANCE THAT CAME OUT ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO BUT IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL REVIEWER FEDERAL APPROVAL. NOW MOVING TO BUDGET RESERVE BIRDS THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES HERE TO KNOW BUT I'D LIKE TO BEGIN JUST WITH THE PREFORMED HERE BECAUSE I KNOW FROM ME CAN BE A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED AT TIMES. BUT UNDER PROPOSITION TWO. UP TO HALF OF THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT CAN BE WITHDRAWN AND THE FIRST YEAR. GOVERNOR DECLARES A BUDGET EMERGENCY. AND THE GOVERNOR CAN DECLARE A BUDGET EMERGENCY WHEN THERE'S A DISASTER AND TYPICALLY THINK YOU HAVE A NATURAL DISASTER BUT IT COULD BE. MAN MADE DISASTER OR- IN THE CASE WHEN THERE IS A FISCAL EMERGENCY AND FISCAL EMERGENCY IS DEFINED AS A SITUATION IN WHICH RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT AND UPCOMING YEAR ARE PROJECTED TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES YEAH. THERE WERE PROVIDED IN THE HIGHEST OF THE LAST THREE BUDGETS AND THEN YOU WOULD JUST THOSE MEASUREMENTS BY A POPULATION AND INFLATION. SO THAT'S SORT OF THE GROUND RULES FOR USING THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND JUST TO KIND OF LEVEL SET HERE THE BSA CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT SIXTEEN POINT TWO BILLION IN. ERROR OF THE BALANCE BUT IF YOU KNOW ON THE SLIDE THE SENATE PLAN WOULD BRING THAT DOWN TO NINE POINT I'M SORRY TO SIX POINT SIX BILLION. AND SO I THINK A FAIR QUESTION IS WILL HOW IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW HALF OF THE BALANCE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY REDUCE IT BY NINE POINT SIX BILLION SINCE NINE POINT SIX BILLION AND MORE THAN HALF OF SIXTEEN BILLION. AND THE REASON IS IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO PRUDENT WE- MADE SIGNS SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONAL DEPOSITS TO THE BSA IN THE YEARS IN WHICH WE'VE HAD. BUDGET SURPLUSES. AND THOSE OPTIONAL SIR DEPOSITS SOME TO ABOUT THREE BILLION. INTERVIEWED AS A FULLY AVAILABLE SO THOSE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT YOU KNOW WITH FOR ALL OF HALF OF THE BALLOTS RULE. SO WE TAKE THE THREE BILLION AND THEN HALF OF WHAT'S LEFT WHICH IS THIRTEEN BILLION THAT SIX AND A HALF BILLION. IN THAT ROOM REALLY BRINGS YOU TO YOU KNOW THAT NINE AND A HALF BILLION OR SO THAT IS BEING UTILIZED UNDER THE SENATE PLAN. SO NEXT- GO INTO LIVE BRIEF DISCUSSION HERE OF HOW THE TWO PLANS WOULD. USE THE COST SHIFT OPTIONS. IN THE FISCAL OPTIONS FOR THE STATE. IF YOU WOULD ALLOW ME TO I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MIDDLE LINE THERE THAT SAYS REINSTATE DEFERRALS AND IN THIS CASE NOT TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL DEFERRALS. REFERRING TO A DEFERRAL OF THE JUNE PAYMENT ROLE PAYMENT THAT GOES OUT TO STATE WORKERS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CALPERS CONTRIBUTION. THE JUNE PAVE PAYROLL- DEFERRAL FOR STATE WORKERS WE WOULD INVOLVE A SHIFT OF THE FIGHT OF THE JUNE. A ROLL PAYMENT GOING FROM LATE JUNE TO EARLY JULY. THERE'S ACTUALLY NO DELAY IN WHEN THE WORKERS RECEIVED THEIR PAYCHECKS BUT RATHER IT'S MORE OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE BUT IT DOES RESULT IN SHIFTING IT TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR ON THAT BASIS. AS FOR THE- DID THE DEFERRAL OF THE CALPERS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER- PAYMENT FROM LATE JUNE TO EARLY JULY. THERE IS AN ACTUAL DELAY IN WHEN THE PAYMENT IS MADE BY A FEW DAYS BUT WE UNDERSTAND- FROM LOOKING INTO IT THAT THERE'S NOT A MATERIAL. IMPACT ON THE CONDITION OF THE STATE'S PENSION SYSTEM FROM THIS ACTION. A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THE DEFERRAL HOLES IN THIS CASE APPLY TO BOTH THE GENERAL FUND AND THE SPECIAL FUNDS. AND THEN THERE'S THE SAVINGS THAT ARE REALIZED ON THE SPECIAL FUNDS SIDE WOULD BE SHIFTED TO THE GENERAL FUND AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LINE THEIR SPECIAL FUND LOANS IN TRANSFER YOU'LL NOTE THAT THAT. ITEM IS ONE POINT ONE BILL THE ENTIRE IN THE SENATE PLAN THEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S NEIGHBOR VISION. AND THAT ONE POINT ONE BILLION REALLY REPRESENTS THE SAVINGS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED FROM THOSE DEFERRALS. BEING SHIFTED INTO THE GENERAL FUND. OKAY SO NOW I THINK A V. TOPIC OF EDUCATION AND PROP NINETY EIGHT IS AN ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA HERE TODAY SO I WILL NOT SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS BUT I WILL TOUCH ON IT. SO WHEN IT COMES TO FIND IN FOR THE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. UNDER THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN IN THE IN THE INSTANCE IN WHICH THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. THERE IS NO REDUCTION IS SCHOOL FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. RATHER THE OVERALL FUNDING LEVEL ACTUALLY GOES OUT BY- IS EIGHT BILLION HIGHER UNDER THE SENATE PLAN THEN UNDER THE- GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. THE WAY THAT THIS IS ACHIEVED IS THROUGH A TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR HIGHER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- GENERALS I'M PAYMENT. WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COLA. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THE GIRLS AT FOR THE SCHOOL PAYMENTS NOW IN ADDITION TO THE DEFERRAL. THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING IN THE NAY REVISION. THE SENATE PLAN WOULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DEFERRALS. SO THAT THAT THE TO THOSE TWO ITEMS THE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION IN HIGHER PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND THE DEFERRAL SON TO EIGHT BILLION AND THAT'S HOW. THAT IS PROVIDE IT. NOW FINALLY THIS LAST PAGE. DISPLAYS RELEASE SOME OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMMATIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SCENARIO IN WHICH THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID. THESE ITEMS SHOWN ON THIS PAGE ROOM THE WAY AT THE HEART OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. YOU WOULD KNOW THAT- THE SENATE BUDGET PACKAGE DOES REJECT SOME OF THE NAY REVISION PROPOSALS SUCH AS THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION. CHANGE AND USE OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING SO INSTEAD OF FUNDING GROW THROUGH THE CONTINUE TO BE USED TO PAY PROVIDER PAYMENTS. AND LIKEWISE THE SENATE PLAN DOES REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IT RELATES TO THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT IS WHICH- IN THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION WOULD REDUCE SERVICE HOURS BY 7% SO YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS ON THE LIST AS WELL. NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE SENATE PLAN DO THAT AND IT'S REALLY WHAT I WAS JUST DESCRIBING THROUGHOUT THE PREVIOUS SLIDES AND THEREFORE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT AND CATEGORICALLY. FIRST THE SENATE PLAN IDENTIFIES A BIT OF NEW REVENUE IN THE NCO TAX ADJUSTMENT. IT ALSO USES THE MEDI CAL WHICH LOWERS THE SPENDING BASS. BUT THEN IT ALSO DOES USE A BIT MORE OF THE STATE'S RESERVES AND IT DOES RELY MORE ON CAUTIOUS AND SOLD. THOSE ACTIONS WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER REALLY ARE WHAT THE NAVAL THE STATE TO PRESERVE THESE EXISTING PROGRAM COMMITMENTS. THAT I'VE YOU KNOW SHOWN HERE ON THIS SLIDE. SO THAT'S THE BEGINNING THAT HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE COMPARISON. BETWEEN THE TWO PACKAGES. AND OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT MY- ISN'T EIGHTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN NINETY OF ANY COMMENTS. GET AFTERNOON AFTERNOON THANK YOU THAT MADAM CHAIR WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE SENATE PROPOSAL AS WELL AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS- WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON A BUDGET THAT IS BALANCED IN YOUR CONS BUT THAT ALSO ADDRESSES SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL JUST SAY NO WE ARE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT. I SEE WHAT ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS OVER THE COMING THREE OR FOUR FISCALLY AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT CAN SCORE SO WE ARE HAPPY IN MINISTRATIONS TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PROPOSALS FOR MOST. FOR TO WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL IT UP TO. QUESTIONS MEMBERS ON THIS ITEM ONLY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT COLLEAGUES SEEN NONE. WILL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ITEM OF DISCUSSION. SENATOR DORADO. HEY FOR THE FRATERNITY. OKAY FROM I GET THIS WRONG I'M SURE YOU'LL POINTED OUT TO ME. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE. THE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES COVERED AND I THINK THIS IS THIS IS THAT RIGHT THIS IS ISSUE ONE RIGHT. YEAH OKAY- JUST WITH REGARDS TO THE MCO TAX. RIGHT OKAY TO YOU IN YOUR ISSUES ARE WITH REGARD TO THE OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK THAT THE ALLEY- JUST LIKE THE FOR THE FRAMEWORK OF THE- BUDGET TODAY YES. RIGHT WHAT ARE WE ON ISSUE ONE. WE WERE ON ISSUE ONE WHICH IS THE OVERALL BUDGET FRAMEWORK YEAH AND THEN THAT IS THE MCO TAX AND A NUMBER OF THINGS. IS THIS RIGHT GIVES THE ATTACK ON THE PART OF THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUDGET SO YES GO HEAD OKAY OKAY- SO I JUST WONDER- I KNOW THAT THE- MAY REVISION INCLUDES A FEDERAL APPROVAL OF THE MCO ENROLLMENT TAX- WHICH WOULD. WHICH WOULD RESULT IN AN OFFSET OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS- THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSED EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR FULL SCOPE MEDICAL BENEFITS TO ALL PERSONS. SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT COST OF WOULD HAVE BEEN SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE GENERAL FUND SO- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATE THE INCLUDE IN A IN THE BUDGET OF TWENTY NEED TO BUT I WANTED OR JUST. KEEP WORKING AT IT TO INCLUDE- THESE US SENIORS SOONER THAN LATER SO THAT'S JUST ON THE MC A TAX- I WANT TO JUST COME INTO OF THE I. H. S. S. AND I SHAPE THE- OF A TEN TO THE H. S. S. UP WERE AND TO THEIR CLIENTS BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY CRITICAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO THE WORKING POOR BUT TO WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES. SO I WENT OUT OF THANK YOU AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THEN- I WANT TO MAKE COMMENT ALSO BUT THE CSU THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT I WANT THEM TO KEEP IN MIND BECAUSE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR OWN BUDGET AND THAT'S THEIR PROPRIETARY AND TO AVOID OUGHT LABOR DISPUTES AND DISRUPTIONS. THE IMPACT OF KOBE NINETEEN IS THE DISEASE IS HAS DESTABILIZED WORKPLACES- ACROSS THE STATE- ALSO ON STATE OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES. ARE AMONG THESE ARE LOW WAGE WORKERS EMPLOYED BY BUSINESSES OPERATED AND FINANCED WITH IN THE CSU SYSTEM ARE THEY INCLUDE RESTAURANTS HOTELS AND RETAIL STORES- THE CSU HAS INCREASINGLY CONTRACTED OUT. THESE FACILITIES TO PRIVATE AUXILIARIES- AND IN TURN SUCH OPERATIONS HAVE. BEEN INVOLVED IN LABOR DISPUTES SO- IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. I LEAVE THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE ACTION TO PREVENT LATE DISPUTES THAT BUT MINE OF THE RE OPENING OF THE CSU SYSTEM. AND I THINK WE TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THE INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS AS WELL AS TAXPAYERS SO I WANTED TO- MAKE THOSE COMMENTS ON THOSE PORTIONS OF THE BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS. FIRST ITEM. SEEING NONE OF COLLEAGUES WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS HAVE THE COMMITTEE SECRETARY PRODUCE A NEW ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION SHEET- SO YOU'LL HAVE ALL THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT WERE ADDED THAT I SHARE WITH YOU VERBALLY SO IT SHOULD BE COMING SHORTLY. AFTER YOUR INDULGENCE YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE ONE STAFF MEMBER. ALLOWED SELL TO A MINUTE WE'LL GET YOU THE ADDITIONAL SHE WITH ALL THE ADDITIONS THAT WERE SHARED WITH US BY OUR COLLEAGUES. MOVING ON TO FOR UNDER ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION. ISSUE TO PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR. FROM LA- FIRST AM I CORRECT ON THAT. WHY IS FINANCE SPEAKING FOR SOME PROBLEM NINETY EIGHT ISSUE TO. THIS IS A I GET IT GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ENTER CABRAL TO LIVE SAID ALMOST OFFICE. MISTER PADDOCK WALK THROUGH OUR QUICKLY AND SOME OF THE HIGH POINTS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT THE SENATE PACKAGE AND THERE ARE ADMINISTRATION MAY REVISE BUT I GOT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT IN IN SOMEWHAT MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW DOES THIS DIFFER. AT AS WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUS THERE AS OF. EACH ARE THERE ARE TWO TWO DIFFERENT PACKAGES ONE ASSUMING FEDERAL FUNDING MATERIALIZES. ONE ASSUMING FOR OPENING DOES NOT. INSTALL WHAT DO THOSE DIFFERENCES UNDER THOSE SCENARIOS- BUT THE FIRST THING BEFORE I GET TO THAT THERE IS ONE PROPOSAL THAT OR OR ONE ACTION IS DIFFERENT IN IN EITHER OF THESE ARE. A SCENARIOS AND THAT'S FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. SO THAT THE- THE REVISION INCLUDED SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO INCREASE BASED PASSAGE KITCHEN FUNDING RIGHT. THE SENATE ACTION IT WOULD PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION AND THEN WOULD. TAKE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND USE THAT TO INCREASE. FUNDING FOR LOW INCIDENCE DISABILITIES WHICH ARE DISABILITIES- RELATED TO SIT BACK TO CHILDREN ARE HEARING VISUAL OR- THAT'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE SENATE PLAN THAT WOULD. WOULD TAKE AFFECT WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE MATERIALIZE. THEN NOW WALKING THROUGH- SOME OF THE KEY CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES- UNDER EACH OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING OF ASSUMPTIONS. IF FEDERAL FUNDS WERE TO MATERIALIZE. THE PACKAGES ARE LARGELY SIMILAR THEY WOULD- BOTH PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE- COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALL CFF AND FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPORTIONMENT. WILL ALSO PROVIDE- CAN BE CALLED A PORTION OF GROWTH. TO TWO NOTABLE DIFFERENCES- IT IN IN THE SENATE PLAN ONE OF THE SENATE PLAN PROJECTS- EXPOSITORY. ADJUSTMENT FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. UNDER CURRENT LAW THIS THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS ADJUSTED AND ANNUALLY FOR THAT PROJECT THE CHANGES IN THE ZERO FOUR POPULATION. AND A BAD AT THE TWO POINT 55% REDUCTION IN THE MIRROR IS. OF THE- THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD BACK TO CHANGE STATUTES SUCH THAT THE SUBJECT MIGHT BE MADE THE ADJUSTMENT WAS. LESS THAN ZERO. RIVER WOULD. RESULT IN A REDUCTION AND THAT- RESULTS IN THAT- TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN- THE COMING OF PROVIDED IN THE SENATE PACKAGE. THE NOT A DIFFERENT IS RELATED TO CALIBRATE COLOR. OF THE S. SENATE PACKAGE ARE SIX SEVEN SEVEN DOLLARS IN A DAY UNSPENT OUR PRIOR FUNDING FOR CAL COLLEGE. AND USES SOME OF FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL TO GROW. AND THEN SEVENTY SEPARATE HOURS. IN ORDER ORGAN BACK DESERVES SIMILAR THESE ARE THE BIGGER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM. THEN MOVING TO IF THERE IS NO FEDERAL FUNDING- BUT THIS IS WHERE THE PACKAGES TO HAVE ARE VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES.

AND THEN TALK ABOUT THANK YOU RATIONING BELIEVES THAT THIS IS AN EL WHEN YOU UNDER FEDERAL. WE NEED A LOT OF. THAT IT. BILLS YES TO FROM ON. THIS SHOULD BE RELATED TO DEALING WITH HOMELESS. AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S. UNREST INITIAL SUBMISSION OF HIS PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE HOMELESS. MUCH WAS MADE TO BE KNOWN ABOUT TRACKING THE SUCCESS OF THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. IN THE COMMUNITIES. TO ME THAT WAS OF A GOOD IF YOU WILL. REFORM AND DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS RATHER THAN JUST PROVIDING HOUSING. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE PROVIDING REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM AND TRACKING THE SUCCESS OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. IT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A RETREAT FROM THAT IN THE- MAY REVISION HERE. COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YES SENATOR NIELSEN I WILL SAY THAT WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON NOT SIMPLY PROVIDING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS WHERE POSSIBLE- BUT ALSO. SERVICES THAT YOU REFERRED TO THAT ARE IMPORTANT WHILE IT IS THE CASE THAT IN THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS WE DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE PROJECTED BACK IN JANUARY AND I. IN THIS AREA. ROSTER A NUMBER OF OTHER AREAS IN WHICH WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORT YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM I NICE DAYS- SOME WORKERS.

AREAS ITEMS RELATE TO RECOVERY IN OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THIS RECOVERY GO AS ROBUSTLY AS POSSIBLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THE GOVERNOR'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY TASK FORCE IS ALSO PROVIDING US WITH IDEAS ON THAT FRONT BUT I THINK THE LAST THING THAT'LL SAVE MONEY. WE PLACE THAT. THE REASON NINETY POPULATIONS BUT THE MANY IF NOT MOST OF THE PEOPLE OUR LOW INCOME AND HAD CHALLENGES ACCESSING HEALTHCARE AND THAT'S WHY IN THIS BUDGET EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE VARIOUS CUTS THAT DISCRETION. DO INCLUDING ITS NEIGHBOR BANKING NORTH AMOUNTS TO BUDGET AND THE STRUCTURE NOW THAT WE ARE FACING THE GOVERNOR DEAN IT A PRIORITY WE DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY. REDUCE CHANGES COMES TO MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY WE DO NOT WANT TO REDUCE THAT CAL WORKS FRANCE THAT ARE RISKY.

HE WILL HAVE A- THE DISCOURSE ALLEN JUST AT THIS POPULATION. YES CAL WORKS. IT TO ME THAT THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF A RETREAT FROM ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL TENETS OF GAIN AND THEN LATER CAL WORKS AND THAT IS. YOU WOULD. BE TO BE IN SOME KIND OF TREATMENT OR EDUCATION. SOMETHING TO UPGRADE YOURSELF SO THAT YOU COULD BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT PROVIDING FOR YOUR HOUSING. IS THAT ROLL BACK THE- STANDARD TIME THAT THE INDIVIDUALS SO BENEFITING WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE ENGAGED AND THEN THEY DIDN'T WORK REHABILITATIVE.

THE TIME THAT WE'RE DEALING THE. CENTER IF I CAN IF I CAN CLARIFY QUICKLY ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE SENATE PROPOSAL FOR THE TIE BOX. WELL THAT WOULD BE PART OF IT YES. SO STILL NOTE THAT THAT THE TIME CLOCK LANGUAGE IS DISCUSSED ON YOUR AGENDA ITEMS IS THE SENATE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD RELAX SOME OF THE WORK REQUIREMENTS- AS WELL AS EXTENDED TIME PARK BUT CURRENTLY THERE IS NO WAY WHICH OTHER THAN TEMPORARY EXECUTIVE ORDER ALLOWING FIRST. GO ON AN ON GOING BASIS DOES WORK REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL ON THE FACT. OKAY THANK YOU. AND IF I COULD ADD SENATOR NIELSEN JUST REMIND US ALL THE SIXTY MONTH TIME CLOCK WAS FEDERAL LAW.

PROBABLY HERE HAS- MICA AND I'M GONNA GET WHIPLASH CONTINUE TO LOOK OVER THERE ALL DAY THANK YOU. IT'S HARD ENOUGH SEEN THROUGH THE GLASS THE NON TRYING TO COVER EVERYBODY. OKAY CONTINUE NON UNDER SOMEONE EDUCATION GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ACCESS EDUCATIONAL REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PAGE FIVE- LA. YES THANK YOU MANAGER BRIAN FROM THE LA- THIS IS A MAJOR REASON HOLES ALL THAT WOULD AUTHORIZE A BILL TO FOR COUNTIES WHEN THEIR- YOUNGER CONTROLLER BUT DOES NOT VALIDATE. YOU WERE ASKED PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS TO CATER TO ALL SCHOOLS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GUIDANCE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S- THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM- FROM A FINANCE. NO COMMENTS EXCEPT TO SAY THAT- THIS IS A PROPOSAL MAKE SURE THAT ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE COMPLYING WITH STABLE ON PROPER GUIDANCE AND WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THE BILL. MADAM CHAIR OF SUB I'D LIKE TO REQUEST THAT WE HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN- THE PENALTY AFFECTS ONLY FIVE BEAR COUNTY SANTA CLARA- SAN MATTEO SAN FRANCISCO MARIN AND NAPA IF APPROVED- SANTA CLARA COUNTY. FOR A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON TOP OF THEIR CURRENT- BUDGET SHORTFALL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION- IN THEIR BUDGET. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE KNOW THE COUNTIES WERE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS WITH THE STATE. FURTHERMORE THE DISK BRAVE AND WE CANNOT. ZERO SHARE INCORRECTLY OR NOT. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BY LAW IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GUIDANCE IN AUDITING COUNTY DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROPERTY TAX THE STATE COMPTROLLER HAS IN FACT AUDITED THE FIVE COUNTIES REGULARLY AND THOSE AUDITS HAVE BEEN CLEAN. IT'S TOTALLY APPROPRIATE THEN CIVIL PENALTIES OF 10% PLUS ONE ON ONE AND A HALF PERCENT A MONTH OR GO RETROACTIVE WHICH I FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE. SAYS THERE IS NO PARTICULAR WRITTEN RULE- ON COUNTIES WHEN THIS CONTROLLER HAS NEVER HAD ANY FINDING THIS IS REPRESENTS SERVE AN X. IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES FINES. OF A ON- CHARGES TO THE COUNTIES. THE SCHOOLS DO NOT ACTUALLY BENEFIT THIS MONEY THAT IT OFFSETS THE STATE GENERAL FUND WITH THE STATE IS CLEAR CLEARING A HAVING A MAJOR BUDGET FIGHTS CRIME. IT IS AN ANY REASON TO TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FROM ONGOING SERVICES FROM COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST- THE COKE HEAD AND ALSO SUFFERING THE SAME BUDGET IMPACTS. IS PATRICIA CONCERNING. THIS THE RESULT IN ONGOING HARM TO COUNTIES AND ONLY THE FIVE BAY AREA COUNTIES IS NOT ELIGIBLE- IN MY COUNTIES PARTICULAR SITUATION. OF THE MONEY- THAT IS CUT OUT. WELL PARTICULAR CHILD CARE IN THE- GRAMS. BUT MOST OF IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. SO IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT PASSED THE FINES PASSED THE- ACTIONS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DISAGREES WITH THE STATE CONTROLLER AND THE COUNTY AUDITOR'S IN THE COUNTY CONTROLLERS. LET'S SIT DOWN AND WORK IT OUT LET'S NOT LET'S NOT HAVE A UNILATERAL IMPOSITION OF- AN EX POST FACTO FIND SYSTEM TO GRAB SOME MONEY. FOR THE STATE BUDGET SO WHERE ARE JOB. OF OPPOSING NESS AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS ITEM ON PUT ON- HOLD AND HELD OPEN FOR CONTINUED DISCUSSION THANK YOU. SENATOR BILL RESTATE WHAT I SAID EARLIER I THINK ON THE RECOMMENDATION. THE CASUAL SEE THROUGHOUT WHEN IT DEALS WITH TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SENATE'S PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS THIS IS THE FINAL OF THE SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND SO WE WILL BE HOLDING ITEMS OPEN TODAY- BUT- TV I'LL- BE NEGOTIATED I'M SURE YOU AND ALL OF THE- REPRESENTATION OF CANADA WILL BE DIRECTLY. YEAH THANK YOU I'M SURE SPEAKER. THE REASON I RAISE IT TODAY WERE. SIDE THE MEETING WAS YOU RAISE YOUR MY CALLED POLICE EXCUSE ME THE REASON I RAISE THIS TODAY pANOTHER WAY IS BECAUSE THIS IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS LIKE- COULD BE. COUNTIES OF CLOSE TO THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND SO THIS WOULD BLOW A PRETTY BIG HOLE IN THE BUDGET. REALIZE THAT BUT I THINK IT'S UNFAIR IT'S- APPROPRIATE I THINK IT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT- WE ARE WE ARE. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS LAST MINUTE. THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR HIT ON THE FIVE COUNTY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER NIELSEN MANAGER LIKE RE VISIT THE RESOLUTION ON THE PREVIOUS ISSUE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE HERE. BUT HE HAD MADE A MOTION AND THEN I THINK YOUR ANSWER WAS THAT THAT ISSUE WOULD BE DISCUSSED AND DEALT WITH IN A SEPARATE. BILL IS THAT CORRECT. WHAT I SAW WAS IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THE PROPOSAL IS TO A TRY TO ADOPT PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN AS WE KNOW. CUSTOM THAT MEANS THAT WE DOT EVERY I AND CROSS EVERY T. IN THE TECH IN TERMS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE INSULT STILL UP FOR NEW. YEAH AND SO. TRAILER BILL. WILL COME BEFORE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THEN FOR REVIEW. ALL UP THE NUMBER. GOOD QUESTION THREE TWELVE I THINK IS MY RECOLLECTION THE ANSWER IS NO- THEY WILL COME UP FOR THE VOTE ON THE FULL SENATE FLOOR. THE BUT WOULD LEAVE MY COLLEAGUES RECOURSE TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT OFFERED ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE HE'S NOT BEEN AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS SORT OF REACH A RESOLUTION ON IS CONCERNED WITH THE FIRST ITEM. HE WAS A FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AND REYES IT AND I RESPONDED SO. WHAT'S THE NEW ASK. WELL HE HE MADE A MOTION AND THERE WAS NO DETERMINATION OF YOUR- RULING ON THE MOTION I GUESS THAT'S A CONCERN SO WHERE THAN IS HE GOING TO GET TO DISCUSS HIS CONCERN ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ITEM HE DID NOT GET TO EXPRESS IT HERE- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER. MORALE WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAND UP AND PROVIDE FURTHER CLARITY ON AND WHAT YOUR ACTUAL MOTION WOULD BE. YEAH I'M JUST GOING TO RE READ IT AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS MY MOTION. FROM OUR MOTION. IS THIS PROPOSAL EXCLUDES NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS SO I MOVED TO A MAN TO- ALLOW THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING SIMILAR TO OTHER SCHOOL BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION SOMEONE. SO WHAT WE WILL DO A SENATOR MORALE IS ADD THAT WHEN IT COMES TIME FOR US TO ACTUALLY TAKE VOTES BECAUSE AS YOU SEE WE'RE NOT TAKING VOTE ON EACH ITEM NOW WE CAN HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT WILL TAKE THE VOTE. AND SO AS WE PULLED OFTEN SEPARATED AND VOTES PER THE REQUEST OF YOUR CAUCUS WILL ADD YOUR MOTION TO THE BOAT AND WE CAN SPLIT THE VOTE WE CAN VOTE ON. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND THEN WE CAN ALSO. IN YOU CAN PULL THAT UP AND DOWN AND WILL ADD YOUR LANGUAGE AND CAN VOTE ON YOUR MOTION AS WELL. IS THAT MAJOR EIGHT. THAT WORKS GREAT SENATOR PAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL PROCESS RECOGNIZING WORDS IN A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT MODES. AS WE ARE TOPPING THE SENATE VERSION OF THE BUDGET I ASSUME THEY SHOULDN'T ASSUME IT IS TO SOME SORT OF CUT. HE BETWEEN VISERYS ALREADY COMPLETED THE SENATE THERE'S DISCUSSES THE GOVERNOR WHATEVER FINAL VERSION THEN. AS A COME BACK TO SENATE BUDGET BEFORE WE PASS IT ON TO THE FLOOR ARE WE GUYS PASSED THAT STREET NOW. IS HE IN THE PAST SIR YEAH THIS THIS HEARING WE PASS THE SENATE VERSION RIGHT- THEY THEN GO TO CONFERENCE. AND THE NOTE WHAT COMES OUT OF CONFERENCE GOES DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR OKAY AND I'M BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE RECORD FROM THE BACK OF THE ROOM. THE COUPLE BACK FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR ABOUT RIGHT BEFORE IT COMES TO FLOOR FOR A VOTE. OKAY IS SO I DID TO CLARIFY THAT ADVICE ROUTE WITH CORRECTLY AND MADE. MY MEMORY SOMETIMES FAULT. WELL YOURS IS BETTER ON BECAUSE AT THAT WE WENT FROM THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE DIRECTLY FROM THE FLOOR BUT BEEN CORRECTED. IF THERE IS ANY. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THEY ALL THE REVIEW BY OUR FULL COMMITTEE SO I THINK PROCESS WHY. THIS WILL TRAILER HOLD THE HOLDING WITH WHICH WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IS A FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE TO FINALLY DECIDE. TO VOTE ON. A TRAILER BILL ONCE IF IT AT THAT TIME APPROPRIATE CORRECT CORRECT THANK YOU THE MANAGER UNTIL TO RESTATE. MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE FINAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BEFORE IT ACTUALLY COMES TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. I STAND CORRECTED ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON INCIDENTS MORALIS CLEAR THAT WE WILL ADD HIS MOTION WHEN WE CHOOSE TO VOTE ON EITHER PLACE HOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR THE LANGUAGE THAT STUDENTS FROM MORALIS FOR. HOUSING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON. GREAT SEEN NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO. ISSUE SIXTY EIGHT IF YOU'LL BE IF YOU FIFTY NINE THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL BACK BILL FOR LOSS OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REVENUES HELLO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JENNY FELLOW WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS WAS PREVIOUSLY KNOWN OR DID I THE REVENUE STREAMS THAT SUPPORT REALIGNMENT ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE- AND ARE EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE A REVENUE DECLINED BUDGET YEAR. THE SENATE PACKAGE WOULD PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED MILLION- TOWARDS THAT DECLINING REVENUE. THANK YOU FINANCING THE COMMENT. NO COMMENT YOUR MANAGER. QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE THIRTY MORE LOCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF SACRAMENTO'S HAD A PRACTICE OF PUSHING FUNCTIONS DOWN TO THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THEN PROVIDING MINIMAL FUNDING. THAT'S EVEN HINT THAT REALIGNMENT FUNDING COULD BE JEOPARDIZED WOULD BE DAMAGING TO FUTURE ATTEMPTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE SO. I SUPPORT THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT IT IS A TRIGGER- ITEM SO I AM- EXCEL GUY AND I. HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO LIKE. DO THE BUDGET IN A MANNER THAT. WOULD PROVIDE FOR ALTERNATIVES IF FEDERAL FUNDING DOESN'T COME IN AS EXPECTED AND I WAS SORT OF HOPING TO HEAR. OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DON'T GET. THE EXPECTED. DOLLAR AMOUNT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT IF IT IS 90% WHAT IF IT'S 75% FIFTY PERCENT- AND SO I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE- THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR CRITICAL HUMAN SERVICES AND I SEE IT AS A FIX CARS BUT NOT AS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE. NATIVE CERTAIN FUNDING LEVELS AREN'T CHEAP SO. IT MAY BE THE LA- OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE TO TOUR REAL BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE. COLUMNS IN NUMBERS AND WHAT IFS. THE MANAGER IF YOU COULD INDULGE ME SURE SO FINANCE COULD RESPOND BECAUSE I THINK- THE THAT WAS INCLUDED AS I RECALL IN ONE OF YOUR INITIAL TRIGGERS AS WELL AND SO FINANCE COULD YOU RESPOND. YES OUR SON BRIEF. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE KRISTIN SHELTON IS ON THE LINE AS WELL AS TO DECLARE FIND THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. IS A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSED ON MEDICATION FROM THE SENATE SO THIS SPECIFIC FRIEDMAN FINDING THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SENATOR. THAT IS NOT IN OUR PROPOSALS WE DO HAVE A PROPOSED ASK FOR OUR CREDIT IRIS RELIEF FUND ALLOCATION NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR BUDGETS ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION UNDER OUR PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE WOULD GO TO THE COUNTIES FOR SOCIAL AND RELATED. SERVICES BUT I THINK YOUR BROADER QUESTION CENTER MORE WATCHES ABOUT. THE OPERATION OF THE TRIGGER AND I CAN SPEAK WITH YOU MISTER NICE PROPOSED IN THAT AREA. IN WAYS- UNDER OUR- GOAL WICKS CONGRESS. WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE. OR NOW. INFLEXIBLE RELEASE MONDAY FOR THAT TRIGGER TO BE TODAY FOR THOSE CUTS TRIGGERED A- FOR ANY WITHIN THAT TRIGGER. YOU GOING TO BACK TO I KNOW THAT SENT. ON PROPOSAL HAS SOME DIFFERENT ITEMS TRIGGER NOT HERE TO WHAT WE HAVE SEC SPEAK TO THOSE SPECIFIC ITEMS BUT IF THEY ARE GOING ON. SIMILAR. IF YOU. ALL NOT FROM THE TRIGGER BEING ON A- NOT SAID I DO TO CLEAR THAT IF WE DO RISK FEDERAL. THAT COMES IN SOME. AMOUNT LAST. OVERALL FOR BILLION DOLLAR NUMBER. FUNDING DOESN'T GO AWAY. IT'S JUST THE K. THAT LIKE. WOULD HAVE TO. ON OWN AND WHAT IT COME BACK I'M NOT A YOU. SOME HOT SEPARATE OTHERWISE BE TAKING FOR YOU THE CASE OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT TO LIST INCREASE WOULD NO LONGER BE GO FORWARD. AND DO YOU HAVE A DAY. THE DATE WHEN YOUR EX THIS FUNDING WILL BE FIFTH. OR IF IT HAPPENED AFTER. THE YEAH SO UNDER THEN THE REVISION PROPOSAL IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A- BY THE TIME THAT THIS BUDGET IS ENACTED THESE CUTS ARE SCHEDULED GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY FIRST NINETEEN SAID UNDER THAT LANGUAGE YES I FUNDING IS AT ANY POINT OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE END OF JUNE TWENTY ONE X. THEN DOES WOULD BE RESTORED ONCE FUNDING IS HERE AND I KNOW THAT HAS BEEN A ITEM DISCUSSION OUR STAFF HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES WORKS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON ON YOUR HOW THIS WILL. REALLY SHOULD BE DATE BUT OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL IS THE CUTS WILL GO TO THE FACT. THAT THE SCHOOL YEAR I WE CAN PASS NECESSARY THERE BALANCE THE BUDGET ANY POINT OVER THE YEAR- SO SIX CONGRESS PASSES SUCH FUNDING. ALL WINTER EVENING NEXT SPRING THIS CUTS WHICH TRIGGERED BACK ON THAT HE SAID THE ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY QUESTION A- FEDERAL PARTNERS WATCHING. CERTAIN HEREBY PLANNING AT A ISSUE ALL TO PROVIDE FUNDING IS. SO I GUESS I WOULD WHAT I SAID WHEN I START MATT IS.

I WANNA MAKE SURE WE PUT THE RIGHT ISSUE SENATOR NELSON. THERE'S SOME CONFUSION IN THE NUMBER OF PAGES HERE MADAM CHAIR SO HAPTICS USERS WERE FINED UNTANGLE IT THAT'S OKAY THE ISSUE OF CONCERN HERE WOULD BE A RELATED TO THE- AT RECALL THE FAIRS. AND AFFAIRS AND THE FUNDING- THAT FOR STATE VISIT FOR FAIR DISABILITIES AND THEN THE IMPACT ON THE DISTRICT FAIRS THE SMALLER ONES. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT GOT IT SO THAT IS OKAY SO IN IN MIND INTO THAT ISSUE FIFTY THREE BUT AGAIN IT IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL.

INCLUDING DEPARTMENT FULLER FORESTRY DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS GENERAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF OOD AND AG. FAIRS THE LEGALLY OBLIGATED STAFF PAINT STAFF PAYMENTS HOMICIDE TRIAL REIMBURSEMENT. IN VARIOUS DEPARTMENT WHILE FIRING PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT UP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT ISSUE SIR. IT SURE TO THE CONCERNED. AND WOOD RELATED TO THE HOMELESS ISSUE TOO EARLY ON THERE WAS A DESIRE TO. MOVE HOMELESS INTO THE- FACILITIES IN THE COUNTIES FOR THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS GOT IT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE- YOU THAT OCCUPY VALUABLE SPACE HOUSING THE HOMELESS WHICH THE FAIRS USED TO GENERATE INCOME. THEY DON'T GET MUCH HELP THE STATE SO THEY HAVE TO GENERATE. INCOME FROM THEIR FACILITIES AND THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE THEN IS THAT HOMELESS POPULATION WOULD IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MONEY. AND IN ADDITION THESE FAIRGROUNDS ARE CRITICAL STAGING AREAS FOR. NATURAL DISASTERS FIRES FLOODS PARTICULARLY AND IF YOU'VE GOT HOMELESS BEING HOUSED THERE THEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE FACILITY FOR E. VANCE FOR WHICH YOU DERIVE INCOME SO THAT'S THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT OPINION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I DID HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING AT CAL EXPO WITH FOR THERE IS. A NEED FOR. CAL BOTH ALSO HAS HAD DIED I MEAN TECHNICALLY THE STATE AGENCY BUT WE HAVE OUR SACRAMENTO COUNTY FAIR THERE IT'S ALSO A STAGING AREA. WE'RE ACTUALLY HOUSING SOME HOMELESS OVER THERE BUT- MORE FUNDAMENTALLY THE PROBLEM IS THAT NORMALLY IT SUSTAINS ITSELF THROUGH THE ACTIVITIES AT THE FAIR BOTH DID THAT HASN'T BUT YET WE CONTINUE TO FIND IT FOR STATE EMERGENCY ROOM UP INTO WHETHER FOR. FUN FOR THE BEARS ALSO INCLUDED CAL BUT SOMETIMES GETS TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE OTHER DISTRICT FAIRS BECAUSE IT IS A STATE AGENCY OFFICIALLY. FINANCE FINANCE YES YES- ON BOTH SIDES CENTER NIELSEN AND SENATOR PANTS QUESTION I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE RESOURCES TEAM SO THEY SHOULD BE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS RESOURCE TAB- ON THE LINE AND SEARCHABLE OUR ON OUR TEAM SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE QUESTIONS. RIGHT NOW DEPARTMENT FINANCE. FORTY POINT THREE MILLION THAT'S ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER REGION BILL REALLY FOCUSED ON THE LEGALLY AMANDA ACOSTA HORSENS. NEEDED FAIRS AS LITTLE CALIFORNIA IS A STATE DOES NEED TO CANCEL THAT WOULD. MAKE YOU ELIGIBLEFOR. SORRY I HAD TROUBLE HEARING YOU IS CAL EXPO PART OF THE FUNDING. THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNDING AS THEY ARE ESTATE THAT THEY NEEDED FAIR OKAY THANK YOU ELIGIBLE OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIRTY NIELSEN. THIS IS THE DESIRED. OR IS IT STILL THE GOAL THEN TO PLACE THE END TO THESE FAIRGROUNDS HOMELESS PEOPLE FOR THEIR RESIDENCY IS IT ARE WE STILL MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. FINANCE. RIGHT WELL I AM FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION I'M NOT SURE OF MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS COOK WHO DEALS WITH A HOMELESSNESS I HAD ANY FURTHER INFORMATION YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT BACKING. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET BACK TO ME THAT IT IS. OF SOME IMPORT OKAY. THAT PARTICULARLY FOR THE STAGING AREA WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE- FACILITIES ENCUMBERED. FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THE NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT EMERGENCY OR THE HIGHEST VALUE CAN BE ATTAINED BY THAT PARTICULAR DISTRICT FAIR. TO RUNNING FACILITIES LEASING FACILITIES. AND I'LL REMIND US I THINK THAT THERE THE ADMINISTRATION DOES HAVE A PROPOSAL OF EXTENDING THEIR- PROJECT ROOM KEY IN TERMS OF PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND IN WAYS IN WHICH THEY HOW ARE ON MOST FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS DURING COLD AND THERE. ARE TERM PLAN AND SO WE MAY BE HEARD ABOUT THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE TO THE BUDGET AS WELL. ALRIGHT WE CAN MOVE ON TO THE FINAL I. ON OUR- AGENDA. WHICH IS SUB FIVE PUBLIC SAFETY. ISSUE EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL BAND THE BOX TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PAGE EIGHTY FOUR. L. L. YES THIS IS JERRY SORT OF WORK WITH LA- AGAIN ON THIS IS- PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PROHIBIT POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FROM ASKING ABOUT AN APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL HISTORY AT ANY TIME BEFORE A FINAL DECISION IS MADE ON THE APPLICANT'S APPLICATION DOES EXEMPT- PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS HOST ACADEMY COURSE WORK. THANK YOU IN THE COMING FINANCE. NO COMMENT BUT AS FOR ANY QUESTIONS BY CALLING YOUR ADWORDS IS ON THE LINE AS WELL GREAT CITIZENS BILL SEN. WELL THIS IS A MAJOR POLICY ISSUE- OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEARING ON THIS ISSUE ANOTHER POLICY COMMITTEES. FINANCES AT ALL. EIGHT IT IT IT IS A PART OF THE SENATE PROPOSALS I'M AS I RECALL AND I BELIEVE IT WAS HEARD IN IN SUB FIVE. WAS IT. THE SKINNER. COULD YOU BIG TO BAN THE BOX DID YOU HEAR IT IN SUB FIVE YES WE DID. WELL AS READERS MAY BE MY ONLY PLACE TO. RAISE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUE THEN. OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS. AND IT CONCERNS ME THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S MY POINT WAS WAS THAT THE SUBJECT SENATOR OF YOUR DISCUSSION AND SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT THAT THE SENATOR SKINNER COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT ADDRESS THE ISSUE NINE EIGHT AROUND THE ON THE BOX- AND- I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE REFERENCE STATE BUT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IT WAS AN AD CODE ITEM. WE COULD NOT- IN THE- INITIAL HEARING WAS NOT ON WE DID NOT CLOSE ON IT IN OUR INITIAL HEARING WE WAS STRESSED. IT WAS. IN THE CON OF A VARIETY OF OTHER- ITEMS THAT WERE RELATED TO SUPPORTING THE ADMINISTRATION. COST SAVINGS IN THE FUTURE YEARS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS BASED ON SOME OBJECTIVE STAT BOTH THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAVE A PAST AND THE GOVERNOR HAS STATED IN THIS BUDGET AND IN FACT ONE ONE OF THEM IS THE CLOSURE BE PRIVATE PRISONS AND FIVE THERE'S IN THE BUDGET AND TAX EXPEDITED TOP LINE ON THE- AND OF. TWO A- TWO WHICH THOSE OBJECTIVES THREE ENTRY SUPPORT AND RECIDIVISM REDUCTION WHICH REENTRY SUPPORT HELPS IS ESSENTIAL. AND THE ABILITY TO WE NOW AS I THINK OF MY COLLEAGUES KNOW PROVIDE MUCH- EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR STATE FACILITIES AND THOSE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO THEN LEAVE OUR STATE FACILITIES AND WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION DE. IT COMES OKAY AND PERHAPS SENATOR NIELSEN WAS REFERENCING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS AND POST SECONDARY- LICENSING PROGRAMS WHICH ARE NOT YOUR TYPICAL A- NOT A PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL- THE SETTING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE DEGREE MIGHT PROHIBIT A PERSON. AT A RECORD FROM BEING THERE AND SO THAT IS WHY IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IT COMPLETELY EXEMPTS WAS ENTIRE. THERE ARE CERTAIN ONES THAT SHOULDN'T EXEMPTED AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WILL. I DISCUSS IN A FUTURE BILL. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A MUCH MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION HOWEVER THERE IS NO EXISTING. EXCLUSION OF ANYONE WITH FORMER UP WITH THE FORMER RECORD FROM A REGULAR COLLEGE CAMPUS FOR IN PURSUIT OF THE REGULAR DEGREE AND SO THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ITEM IS. SENATOR ROBB.
