AND SO I JUST WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT ARE YOU IS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DOING. TO SPECIFICALLY RECRUIT TEACHERS OF COLOR. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA- AND- I'M GONNA ASK OUR CHIEF DEPUTY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM SOME SCHOLARSHIPS AND SOME OTHER THINGS HOW NINE HUNDRED MILLION BREAKS OUT- BUT WHAT I'D SAY TO YOU IS THAT WE AGREE. THAT WE HAVE. FIGHT MAKE SURE WORKFORCE REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STUDENTS AND IN THAT RESPECT- IS EXPLORING HOW EXPENSE OF OUR MILLAGE CATER OF COLOR PROGRAMS. HOW THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE NIGHT DID MILLION OTHER BUT IT CAN BE CUSTOMIZE AND TAILORED TO HELP. FROM CRUDE AND RETAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE- WE'VE BEEN ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING OTHERS ABOUT ANY THAT IS A BARRIER. TO CANDIDATES OF COLOR WHO CHOOSE TO ENTER THE FORCE THERE ALWAYS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WELL WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO BECOME A TEACHER AND HAD A WEEK AMEND POST MAKE SURE YOU PUT. THE BEST STRATEGIES- THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE HANDLE RECIPROCITY MEETING SOMEONE THAT- CREDENTIAL FROM AN UPSTATE AND HOW DO WE GET EASIER ONE. WHO WANT TO TEACH IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO TEACH A- PLAN SO WE ARE ENGAGED. IN THE STATE IS. YEAH BUT WE DO. WHEN NOW WE- CONSIDER. THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS READ CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AND BY TRYING AND HOW WE SHOULD EDUCATORS THERE BECAUSE WE THINK BIAS EXISTS IN EVERY SINGLE SECTOR AND WE HAVE TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN OFFSET THOSE BY PEACE AND THAT WE WANT TO- TRULY- HAVE WORK THAT WILL REFLECT. THE CITY OF OUR STUDENTS IT IS AFTER A DEEP YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. IT PROGRAMS FALL DOWN FOR TEACHER ME TO. RATES DITION TO WHAT OUR SUPERINTENDENT TALKED ABOUT WERE ALSO WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN. SUPERINTENDENTS ASSOCIATION ON HUMAN RESOURCES PRACTICES SO GUIDANCE FOR OUR DISTRICTS AROUND THE HUMAN RESOURCES PRACTICES TO HAVE A VERY INCLUSIVE HIRING PROCESS AND STRATEGIES.

LAID OUT HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IN JANUARY HE SPOKE DIRECTLY TO THE NEED TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP HE SPOKE DIRECTLY TO THE NEEDS TO- CREATING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. DESIGNS THAT WILL HELP US TO DIVERT ATTRACT A MORE DIVERSE WORK FORCE AND CLOSE THE GAP. AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET ARE CALLED OUT BUT WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE SUPPORT SPECIFICS IN PLACE. THAT WILL HELP US RESULT IN A MORE DIVERSE TEACHER SO IT IN NUMBER. ARE ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS. THIS STATE GOVERNING MEGAN TOWARDS THAT END YOU KNOW IT WAS NUMBERS GETTING BETTER JUST A WEEK AGO WE CONVENE A- A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH EDUCATIONAL EXPERTS ON WHERE WE ARE AS RELATED TO TEACH DIVERSITY. THE HEAD OF THE COMMISSION ON SHE COULD ACTUALLY. DID LAY OUT HOW THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE. IN SOME CATEGORY FOR TEACHERS OF COLOR BUT IT UP THAT.

OKAY YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER I JUST SAY THAT I HE- STATED IT YEAH OPENING REMARKS FOR US TO BE AND THE NATION OF PER PUPIL SPENDING. IS A PATH CANNOT ARGUE. CALIFORNIA EDUCATION NEEDS MORE REVENUE I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERY EXPERT WHO'S EVER WRITTEN ON THE SUBJECT. SAID. CALIFORNIA-DRIVERS-PAY-UNDERFUNDED-STATE-PATROL-PENSION. US THE REALITY THAT WE ALSO HAVE A STRUCTURE CHALLENGE. STATE DOESN'T GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO COVER ALL THE NEEDS OF OUR IT SHOULD ONLY. A LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IF LOOK THERE. SPENT FOR KATE APPROVE A TWELVE EIGHT AN OUTRAGE CATION IS PROBABLY FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL BUDGET. OTHER IN SO I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IT IS TRUE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED MORE REVENUE NOW AND THEY ARE STRUGGLING I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THIS IS NOT AN EXCLUSIVE PROPOSITION TO SAY THAT YOU ONLY FOR. THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND IT NOR BUT ALSO NEED YOU BETTER WE HAVE TO DO MORE. IN A WAY THAT'S FOCUS ON HOW WE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WITH THE LITTLE THINGS BUT TENNIS. EIGHT TRIED TO WITH THE DEPARTMENT ASIAN THE FIFTH. WEEK SUPPORT THE COMMERCE ABOUT EXPANDING REVENUE WE NEED MORE PERMANENT REVENUE SOURCES WE'VE GOT TO WORK TOWARDS THAT- AND IT THAT WAY. AND ABOUT A DOZEN WORK GROUPS THAT TO FOCUS ON ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE THINK ARE DISTRICTS OUR FOCUS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION- CLOSING THE TEACHER SHORTAGE OF CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THE ISSUE OF REVENUE HOW WE CREATE PERMITS. IS A SCHOOL THIS WE HAVE PARTICIPATION FROM A THOUSAND FOLKS FROM ACROSS THE STATE MOSTLY EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THAT GROUP CONTINUES AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND ANY OTHER- YOU NOBODY AND IN THIS INSTITUTION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CREATE. HERMIT SOURCES OF REVENUE BECAUSE WAS MUCH AS ITS BUDGET DOES IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS HAVE DONE. WE KNOW THAT WHEN THERE'S A DOWNTURN- THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO BE OUT AND ARE DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO FEEL IT LIKE YOU KNOW WE COME FROM. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED I SERVED ON A SCHOOL BOARD THAT. YOU KNOW LITERALLY WAS AT CLOSE TEN SCHOOLS HIGH FOR ME SCHOOLS THAT SERVE. THEM KIDS IT WAS ALL BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE OUT.

OF A- EXPLORING IN AT ALL- OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE EDUCATION REVENUES A I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT- THE INEVITABLE DOWNTURN SOMETIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE- WHETHER WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING PROGRAMS NOW RATHER THAN- FOCUSING ON EXISTING PROGRAMS THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS MR DONALD RIGHT YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY FOR BEING HERE TODAY IN YOUR THOUGHTS AND I JUST HOPE YOU'LL BECOME A CHAMPION WITH US I MEAN AND I JUST. FIGURE BACK ON MISTER MOORE SEARCHES COMMENTS THE CALL IS WAY TOO LOW TWO POINT 29% I THINK THAT'S A NO BRAINER- SURE THAT DOESN'T EVEN BEAT CPI. RIGHT SO THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM- AND WE WERE EVEN DRAWING DOWN RESERVES IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH IS A PROBLEM- AND SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. IDENTITY WAS CREATED- BEFORE I GOT HERE PROBABLY ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO THE CC EITHER CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE I BELIEVE THEY DON'T REPORT TO YOU IS THAT ACCURATE. THEY DO NOT IN WELL I THINK THEY SHOULD NAY BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLEBIT MORE ACCOUNTABILITY I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE FIELD A- IN IT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE OUR ONE STOP SHOP FOR EXPERTISE. IT'S KIND OF FLOATING OUT THERE I'M AWARE THEY BELONG- IS SO I THAT'S A THAT'S A CONVERSATION I'D LIKE TO HAVE GO FORWARD. I WITH THIS TURN BACK. OF ONE OF THE- YEAH THINK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR IS A MEMBER O'DONNELL AYE WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE OB WOULD LIKE SEE THE TO BE EITHER WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THIS BUDGET I THINK ENVISIONS THE BEST USE OF WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY BOTH IN ONE TIME DOLLARS AND SOME ONGOING DOLLARS- YOU KNOW YOU AND I KNOW BOTH WELL THAT BY THE END OF THIS BUDGET SESSION. THAT BUDGET MAY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT YEAH AND YOU KNOW IT I KNOW THAT THE PROJECTIONS OF REVENUE HAS CHANGED FROM THE TIME THAT THIS BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED TO NOW- AND- SHOULD THAT CONTINUE TO BE FAVORABLE OF YOU KNOW- THAT ANYTHING'S. LATER WILL BE. BAD AS THE C. C. E. UM YEAH I WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ALL OF OUR EDUCATIONAL EDUCATION AGENCIES FIT INTO THE MIX ABOUT WHAT WE DO WE WORK WITH ALL OF THEM- BUT WE THINK IT EVERY ORGANIZATION WE HAVE TO EXAMINE HOW WE ADMINISTER EDUCATION IN THE STATE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY WE WANT AT THE SITE PARTNERSHIP WITH C. C. E. R. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OR OR ANYONE ELSE HAS BEEN ALL. I TO WORK WITH KIDS OF CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION. SERIOUSLY TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT NEEDS IT- THE WE'VE CREATED SOME STRUCTURES TO ALLOW US. TO BETTER DO THAT- TO FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN INCREASE REVENUE. IN THE STATE SORRY WE BRING THE CHECKBOOK HERE TODAY WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL. THE STATE CHECKBOOK BUT WE AGREE. THEY SHOULD NEED MORE REVENUE AND TO ALWAYS BE DRIVING CHANGE TO HELP CALLED THE TREATMENT GAP SOLVE OUR STUDENTS COULD GREAT QUALITY EDUCATION. GREAT THANK YOU AND I ARE GOVERNMENTS OF. OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEMS FOR DESPAIR RIGHT TO A LEVELS A LOT GOING ON OUT THERE- THERE IF THEY'RE QUITE A FEW LEVELS RIGHT. AND I DO THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THIS YOU SEE THAT WHOSE UMBRELLAS AND UNDER. THAT GETS A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME AND THAT'S JUST ONE OTHER ELEMENT. ANTIQUATED BRING OF. UNDER ONE UMBRELLA EVEN CREATING WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION. BUT THEN AGAIN I GUESS SOME THE DUTIES WILL STILL BE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CREATING AN APARTMENT. REALLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SO THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS WILL HAVE GOING FORWARD I THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT WHICH IS SAID TO YOUR LAST POINT ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I THINK THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF. QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THAT WILL LOOK ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR IS THAT IF IT HAS THE ABILITY TO. STREAMLINE A SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THE FAMILIES- ALONE THE CONTINUUM. OF SUPPORT IN CHILDCARE AND- HOME VISITING- WE CAN SUPPORT IT YEAH I SEE. SOMETHING THAT. DIFFICULT CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE STATE. BUT WE'RE LOOKING. THE HOUSE KING IN OTHER STATES. AND OTHER IMPACTS. AND BENEFITS FOR OUR KIDS AND FAMILIES- WILL. BE SUPPORTED WITH A FOUR FOUR IS THAT. THE FORMATION OF THAT DEPARTMENT IS BEING GUIDED. BY THE STATE'S- EARLY EDUCATION MASTER PLAN. AND THAT THAT WILL REALLY POINT TO. A WHAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WAY. TO SUPPORT OUR OUR YOUNG ARE YOUNGEST CHILDREN. AND THEIR- CONSERVE TUNE ON THAT COMMON STATE. CERTAINLY WELCOME. INPUT BACK THE STATE AND- MY SERVICES A GOOD THING. BUT CREE BUREAUCRACY MORE WE ARE. MAIN SO THAT'S JUST OF LIKE WE'RE THINKING THROUGH THAT LENS WELL THANK YOU IF I NEVER SEE ANYTHING ELSE WOULD BE ON THE RECORD THAT. I WANT TO. OR BE SICK. USE BUT ESPECIALLY. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE A BUT I WANTED PIPING A LITTLE BIT FOLLOW UP WITH MURATSUCHI SAID OF COURSE WE WANT BOTH WE MORE MONEY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PROPERLY FUNDING LCF PFAFF AND THIS CALL UP AND LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS AND FOR OUR KIDS THAT ARE THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD SO FAR FOR. IN A LOBBY DAY FOR VENN DIVISIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND NOW I HAVE I'M SURE YOU HAVE AS WELL AND WE'RE HEARING THE ONE QUESTION SO FAR IS ASSUMING IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER AND IS NOT ONE MORE PENNY IN THAT. MAY REVISION. AND WE HAD JUST THE MONEY WE HAVE HERE ON THE TABLE. WOULD WOULD BE WE BETTER OFF- FLEXING SOME OF THESE DOLLARS AND YOU LLOWING THEM TO BE UTILIZED FOR. DISTRICTS TO DISASTER CORPS NEEDS THE YEAH WE SAW. YOU KNOW YOU WORKED HARD TRYING TO FOCUS ON OUR DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH IS- FINANCIALLY SHAKY. JUST READ RECENTLY THAT OF THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL OF ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE IN THAT CERTIFICATION LEVEL WHICH ARE. ARE FINANCIALLY TROUBLING AND SO THAT BEING SAID. YOU KNOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT HAVING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES GO TO KEEP DISTRICTS FINANCIALLY. STABLE OR DO A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND TO FOCUS ON OUR- OUR CORTINES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE TRY TO BE EVERYTHING TO EVERYBODY. YOU'RE NOTHING TO NOBODY SO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT MR SPI. I'M A BOTH KIND OF PERSON AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THE LIKE I SAID THESE ARE NOT. MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE PROPOSITIONS I THINK THAT WE DO NEED MORE FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS OVERALL AND I THINK THAT WE NEED CREATIVE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS REALLY CRITICAL NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN- LARGELY NOT. ADDRESS FOR MANY MANY YEARS PRIOR- I THINK THAT YOU AYE I'VE HEARD FROM- SOME LEGISLATORS OUTSIDE OF THIS PARTICULAR CHAMBER WHO ALSO SAID OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REALLY HURTING. AND NEED HELP AND AS IS NO EXTRA MONEY LAYING AROUND MY SUGGESTION TO THEM. AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT WE LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS TOGETHER THAT WILL MAKE SENSE FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BOTTOM LINE. AND WILL MAKE SENSE ON THINGS THAT REALLY I DON'T THEY ARE. THE G. I REALLY THAT I GOVERNOR IS REALLY ALSO WANTING TO DO MORE AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD FIND WAYS TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR ON IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS AND STRATEGIES THAT WILL MEET ALL OF THE NEEDS OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ULTIMATELY ARE SIX MILLION STUDENTS OKAY THANKS FOR CHAIR YEAH I JUST WANNA YEAH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS BUDGET WE'RE SLIDING BACK INTO THE CATEGORY CLARA. AND THAT THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULDN'T DO I THINK WE SHOULD SET THE BAR GIVE DISTRICTS THE RESOURCES IN THROUGH BUT YOU KNOW NOT WE'RE ALWAYS DOING WE SEE A HOLDING SOME OF THEM BACK SO THEY DON'T. MEAN JUNE ACHIEVEMENTS THAT SOMETHING DISCUSS FOR THAT POINT COM. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR ON THE ISSUE OF CAT. IS BUT AS I. AS I LOOK AT THE BUDGET THAT HE'S PUT FORWARD I SEE IT VALUING. WHAT ELSE CFF MEANS TO OUR DISTRICTS I SEE A 12-1 IF NOT. I'M GONNA DIE I DON'T TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT POINT JACK I'M NOT A LOT OF MONEY SET ASIDE FOR LITTLE PROJECTS EVERYWHERE YES THAT'S GREAT. YES BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT DOES SLICE BACK. TOWARDS THE CATEGORY CLARA HAS THERE BEEN A CALL FOR CATEGORICAL SO I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY THIS GOES RIGHT BUDGET AND I WOULD SAY IT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WERE SLAIN BACK IN THAT ERA. GOT IT. YEAH IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE ALL GOOD IDEAS A TEACHER. PROGRAMS AND ALL OF THOSE ARE IDEAS AND THEY'RE NOT. ESSENTIALLY FLEXIBLE ON EVERYTHING TO US BY DISTRICTS WHEN THEY APPLY FOR GRANTS. AS YOU KNOW MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND KIDS ARE FROM SMALLER DISTRICTS AND I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR THOSE OF. MY FOR JUST TWO OTHER THOUGHTS NOT A QUESTIONS THE COMMENT IS THAT. YEAH WE'RE THIRTY NINE. IT'S A DISGRACE OUR FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS COMPARISON THERE STATES. I AGREE WHAT WE YOUR TASK FORCE AND- MISTER MARTZ SUED SHE AND I AND SOME OTHER- ASSEMBLY. DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING AT THEIR CSPA PROPOSALS AND FULL AND FAIR FUNDING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN BRING THAT BACK BECAUSE- THESE ARE JUST BANDAIDS AND SO WE GET THAT. AND THEN I KNOW WE'LL GET INTO IT BUT I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF. ON THE PROPOSAL ON THE REWARD FOR EARLY EDUCATION. I HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON IT YET ANOTHER IS ACTUALLY A TRAILER BILL IN A COMPANION BILL INTRODUCED AND I THINK THIS COULD BE NEEDS TO FULLY. THAT THE IMPLICATIONS IT'S INTRIGUING. TO HAVE A SOFT KISS YOU ADD. YOU THINK. MY TAX. KIDS ARE FAMILY. AND OUR PER. AND THAT SHOULD BE. OUR ONLY FOCUS ON HOW IT IMPACTS ADULTS AND BUREAUCRATS YOU KNOW SO BE IT SO. I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE HOW WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE GOING FORWARD SO. I WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ONE LAST YES- SURE IF I COULD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- ON THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T HAVE GRANT WRITERS- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN MONITORING WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR SMALLEST. AND RULED TRICKS. THERE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE THERE ARE WAYS TO CREATE. AN ESTABLISH. FORMULA THAT ALLOW DISTRICTS TO BE SEE FUNDS. BASED ON ELIGIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE WHETHER IT'S FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH OR OTHER NEEDS. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HELP REALLY FROM THE LEGISLATURE. IN MAKING THAT THE WAY THAT OUR LEGISLATION IN EDUCATION. THIS IS AN EX. JUST LAST POINT ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS ARE IN THE BUDGET- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. FOR AS MANY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN. ABOUT GETTING RID OF THEM AND JUST FUNDING DISTRICTS BOTTOM LINE. I WOULD SAY WE PROBABLY HEARD FROM AS MANY DISTRICTS TO SAY. THAT PROGRAMS LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT W- WHAT WE HAVE TOUGH CHOICES TO MAKE THAT WE NOT SAY IT'S ONE OF THE OTHER. BUT THAT WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO MAXIMIZE WHAT WE HAPPEN TO GET MORE OF WHAT WE NEED- AND TO SUPPORT OUR DISTRICTS. AND WE SAID WE'RE AVAILABLE TO HELP WITH THAT CONVERSATION AT ANY POINT AND BE LOVED. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WILL START TO BRING UP NOW ARE- PANEL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE LA YELLOW. AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. BUT BEFORE THAT WE WILL TAKE THE ROLE OF THE BEFORE THAT WE WENT TO INTRODUCE AN ANNOUNCER WELCOME. OUR NEW EDUCATION CONSULTANT TO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ERIN CABLE SIR FIRST DAY ON THE JOB. HER FIRST HEARING SO- HERE SHE IS TO HELP US TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS OF. CALIFORNIA'S KIDS IN OUR SCHOOL SO WELCOME. THANK SURE. THE BATTLE TO THE LOCAL. CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. MCCARTY HERE BRO GALLAGHER I'M ON. MEDINA MURATSUCHI O'DONNELL. OKAY THANK YOU SO WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN LA- AND THEN HEAR FROM OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON LEAST RESIDENTS GET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SO I'M JUST GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE YOU SHOULD BE RECEIVING A ONE PAGE HANDOUT- IN FIGURE ONE OF THAT HAND THAT IS JUST THE BASIC THE THREE YEARS OF THE BUDGET WINDOW THE MINIMUM COUNTY. A FIGURE TO- GIVES YOU A DETAILED LIST OF ALL OF THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING PLAN ON FOR K. TWELVE ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU'LL SEE FIGURE THREE IS THE SPENDING PLAN FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO WITH THAT I ONCE AGAIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF A VERY EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG ECONOMY- BOTH AND IF YOU NOTICE SOME FIGURE ONES BOTH- PROPOSITIONS NIGHT GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND PROPERTY TAX ARE INCREASING OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW. THIS IS- IF IT'S OUT PERFORMING OUR PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS- ANOTHER FACTOR JUST TO NOTE IS THAT WE ARE STILL SEEN DECLINING ENROLLMENT SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ROMAN AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE THIS A DECLINE AS PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET NEGATIVE MIGRATION PEOPLE LEAVING THE STATE. AND THEN ALSO A CONTINUING DECLINE IN OUR TRIAL ARE BIRTHRATES- I THINK IT FINANCE WERE HOPING THAT NOW WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF BABIES FOR SOME REASON BUT- SO PRIMARILY OF. OLD OF THESE FACTORS- THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE THAT IS GOING TO IS PROJECTED TO BE IN A TEST ONE OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WHICH IS UNUSUAL IN THE HISTORY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. ON BUT IS ALSO A RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE GUARANTEE FROM OUR PREVIOUS OB. PROJECTION SO THREE IN A TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN. NINETEEN TWENTY I'M AND THEN A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE EXPECTED- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS OVER THE NINETEEN TWENTY. REVISED AMOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY IN THIS PROJECTION YOU'RE GONNA SEE AN INCREASE IN TO THE DEPOSIT MADE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. A LAST YEAR'S YOU KNOW WE ENDED UP- MEETING ALL OF THE FACTORS REQUIRED TO DEPOSIT AND THE DEPOSIT WAS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION ERE NOW ESTIMATING IT WILL NEED TO MAKE A DEPOSIT OF FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY MALE FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE WERE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. STE SHOWING THAT WE WILL NEED TO NEED TO TAKE WITH DRAW FROM THE RESERVE. AND SPEND TOWARDS EDUCATION AND THIS IS JUST BECAUSE THE PROP NINETY MINUTE GUARANTEE IS NOT INSURING GROWTH- AN ADJUSTMENT UP FOR THE INFLATION FACTOR. SO WITHOUT AGAIN I PLAN ON JUST. I PROVIDED YOU WITH THE DETAILS BUT I DON'T PLAN ON GOING OVER THE PROPOSAL'S. SPECIFICALLY IN FACT THE SUPERINTENDENT DID A VERY GOOD JOB FOR US AND PRESENTING OUR PROPOSAL SO I WON'T NEED. TO REPEAT HIM- BUT JUST BASICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR SPENDING PLAN. YEAH REALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE WERE FACING IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AND ALSO JUST THE NATION THE NATION'S POLITICS OF THE CLIMATE OF THE POLITICS SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IN THIS. BUDGET IS BALANCED THE ONE TIME AND THE GUN ON GOING EXPENDITURES. FOR THE ONGOING EXPENDITURES WE FORK FOCUSED ON THE A LARGEST OF. PROGRAMS CONTINUE IN THE PROP ANY GUARANTEE WHICH IS THE ALPHA FIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION NUTRITION. SORRY ABOUT THAT SO SPECIFICALLY OTHER BUDGETING PROPOSES A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION OF CFF THAT IS A TWO POINT TWO NINE COLA THAT YOU YOU DISCUSSED EARLIER ALL OTHER COULD CALL- CATEGORICAL THRILLER SEE THE SAME COLA AND THAT TOTALS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ALMOST HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. INCLUDED IN SHOWN ON THE SHEET IS A SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR- AUGMENTATION TO SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THIS IS TO IMPLEMENT A NEW SPECIAL EDUCATION REFORM FORMULA. ON LAST YEAR OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS RECEIVE THE SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THEY RECEIVED AT- INTO OTHER DIFFERENT PROGRAM SO WE CAN GO INTO THAT LATER IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY EITHER SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE NUTRITION REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES. THEY ARE REALLY TARGETING RESOURCES AND SUPPORT IT PROGRAMS AIMED AT CLOSING THE AT THE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAP AGAIN AS THE SUPERINTENDENT NOTED THESE ARE- THESE ONE TIMERS TO ENSURE THAT TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. THE FIRST A GROUP OF EXPENDITURES AS THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE AD FOR TEACHERS- THE DETAILS I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS AGAIN WE'LL DISCUSS THAT AT ANOTHER HEARING BUT RESEARCH IS JUST REALLY INDICATING THAT WILL PREPARE TEACHER WORK FORCES THE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN PREDICTING STUDENTS ACHIEVEMENT. AND IN CLOSING THE GAP ACHIEVEMENT GAP HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS STRUGGLED- OVER MANY YEARS IN RETAINING ITS TEACHERS AND ALSO PREPARING THEM. SO ESPECIALLY IN OUR HIGH NEED A SUBJECT MATTER AREAS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SCIENCE MATH SIX THAT ARE A- SO ON THE NEXT MAJOR EXPENDITURES ON THAT DETAIL KATE TWELVE LIST. REALLY WORK WITH THE A NARROWING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS THAT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT TARGETED RESOURCESAND STATE SUPPORT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT INFLUENCE THE STATE'S PERSISTENCE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO ESTABLISH OPPORTUNITY GRANTS ON THE PROGRAMS WILL TARGET STATE'S HIGHEST. POVERTY AREAS THOSE DEEP POVERTY AREAS WITH THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS THESE ARE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC GAP AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GRANT THESE GRANTS WILL ACTUALLY- BE GIVEN TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE- AND THEN PROVIDE THEM WITH PLANNED AND WAYS TO MAKE SYSTEMIC AND PREVENTS IN THEIR AREAS. ALSO IT. ALL PUSH THE COMMUNITIES GRANT. I'M NOT IS JUST REALLY TO- INCENTIVIZE AS SUPPORTING THOSE AND INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODELS. OF THE LAST- WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS IS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AGAIN THIS IS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION THESE ARE ONE TIME GRANTS IT'LL GO OUT SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE PROVIDING PRESCHOOL- THAT HAVE PRESCHOOL CENTER PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES TO THEIR STUDENTS. SO WITHOUT ON THAT IT IS ALL THAT I WANTED- TO COVER IN THIS AREA BUT NOW I WILL. TURN THE MIKE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SARAH BURTON WHO WILL COVER THE EARLY LEARNING CARE PROPOSALS. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR BERNARD THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE LISA SAID I'LL BE REVIEWING THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE BUDGET PROPOSALS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES IT INCLUDES A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL BE HOUSED UNDER THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. IT WILL BE THE NEW LEAD AGENT FOR CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM. OTHER CURRENTLY BEING ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THERE'S FUNDING IN THE BUDGET TO ESTABLISH A TRANSITION TEAM FOR THE NEW DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS TO ESTABLISH POSITIONS TO FACILITATE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING EFFORTS. FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES MULTIPLE AUGMENTATIONS TO CHILDCARE PROGRAMS INCLUDING A NET INCREASE OF FIFTY FOUR MILLION. NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR CAL WORK STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE CHILD CARE. TEN MILLION PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS FOR APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED NEW GENERAL CHILDCARE SLOTS. IN THE SECOND YEAR ADDITION OF A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN NONPROFIT TO NINETY EIGHT. GENERAL FUND FOR TEN THOUSAND NEW AND NON ELLIE A FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL FOR. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. A PROGRAM TO PROMOTE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES BY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AND THAT IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND- AND WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY LEESON OR I OR ONE OF OUR- FINANCE COLLEAGUES ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS. NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME ALEJO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT. AS YOU KNOW THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS DETERMINED BY ONE OF THREE TESTS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. YOU FOR THE ADMINISTRATION MENTION THAT TEST ONE IS THE OPERATIVE TEST OVER THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE PERIOD. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT STATE REVENUE CHANGES BY MAY OF THE PROPERTY TO NINETY GUARANTEE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE ABOUT FORTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR HIGHER LOOK FOR A STATE REVENUE. IT ALSO ANY CHANGES LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WOULD HAVE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR EFFECT ON THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THIS I TO PAGE WHAT OUR HANDS BUT THE- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THREE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES FROM LAST JUNE. THAT'S MAINLY A STORY ABOUT HIGHER PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THE GUARANTEE IS UP FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION AND THAT'S MAINLY A STORY ABOUT HIGHER GENERAL FUND REVENUE TURNING TO PAGE TWO THE GUARANTEE IN THE BUDGET YEARS TWO AND A HALF BILLION ABOVE THE REVISED NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL- BRING THE TOTAL GUARANTEED TO ABOUT EIGHTY FOUR BILLION. ONE ISSUE TO EMPHASIZE IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND THIS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE ARE CONNECTED. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS HIGHER BY MAY IT'S LIKELY THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE LARGER DEPOSITS DEPOSITS TO TE EXTENT THE GUARANTEE IS LOWER- THE STATE WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO. LARGER WITHDRAWALS FROM THE RESERVE IS THERE THE SOFT FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. I TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF OUR HAND OUT. WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES OF GENERAL FUND ROSE REVENUE ARE REASONABLE THE ADMINISTRATION IS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO US IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN US IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND A LITTLE BIT BELOW US IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OUR ESTIMATES ARE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR SOME RISKS TO THE STATE ECONOMY INCLUDING SOME SLOWDOWNS IN TRADE ACTIVITY AND JOB GROWTH. BUT BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW TODAY WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATE OF STATE REVENUE AND THE GUARANTEE SEEM REASONABLE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ABOVE US ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM US ABOUT THAT IN THE COMING DAYS BUT I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT DIFFERENCE I KNOW A LITTLE BIT BY THE TIME WE DO OUR NEXT OUTLOOK IN MAY. AGAIN ANY CHANGES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE OR PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES WOULD AFFECT HOW MUCH FUNDING IS AVAILABLE IN YOUR OVERALL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. I TURNING TO PAGE FOUR- ALL OF THE INCREASES IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD SUPPORT NEARLY FOUR BILLION IN NEW SPENDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS YOU THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATED EARLIER THOSE NEW PROPOSALS ARE DIVIDED ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN ONE TIME AND I'M GOING AUGMENTATIONS. FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THE ON GOING FUNDING IS REALLY A STORY ABOUT THE TWO POINT 29% COST OF IT JUST MEANT. MOST OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING AS YOU HEARD IS ABOUT IMPROVING THE EDUCATION WORK FORCE OR IMPROVING ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FIRST FOR CERTAIN LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS. PAGE FIVE IS JUST A RUNDOWN OF THIS OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT SLICE OF THE HAD. THE INFORMATION THAT'S ON THE ADMINISTRATION SHEET I'LL COVER EACH OF THOSE PROPOSALS IN MORE DETAIL LATER THIS YEAR TURNING TO PAGE SIX WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET OVERALL HAS SOME POSITIVE COMPONENTS- WE THINK THE MIX OF ONE TIME AN ONGOING PROPOSAL SEEMS REASONABLE. HAVING SOME FUNDING SET ASIDE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES PROVIDES YOU WITH THE QUESTION IN CASE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE DECLINES. IN TAT SCENARIO IT'S LESS DISRUPTIVE TO ADJUST THE ONE TIME SPENDING AN ONGOING PROGRAMS LIKE THE LCF. I THINK THE BUDGET ALSO WE THINK THE BUDGET ALSO WITH DRAWS ATTENTION TO SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES IN EDUCATION- MANY DISTRICTS FOR EXAMPLE DO STRUGGLE WITH ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. AND MANY DISTRICTS TO REPORT HAVEN'T DIFFICULTY FINDING TEACHERS IN CERTAIN SUBJECT AREAS TURNING TO PAGE SEVEN WE% HAVE TWO MAIN CONCERNS TO DROUGHT YOUR ATTENTION- FIRST WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALSARE UNLIKELY TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT WE THINK MANY OF THE PROPOSALS WOULD NOT ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND- ENHANCE THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE. MANY OF THE PROPOSALS ALSO HAVE LITTLE DETAIL ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS TO BE SPENT WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO ASSESS HOW EFFECTIVE THEY MIGHT BE. SECONDLY WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT PROVIDE MUCH FISCALLY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I DISTRICTS ARE FACING COST PRESSURE FROM VARIOUS SOURCES- PRIMARILY HIGHER PENSION COSTS AND HIGHER COSTS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. ARE THE BUDGET DOES PROVIDE A COLA- BUT GIVEN SOME OF THOSE OTHER PRESSURES. WE THINK MOST DISTRICTS HAVE AT. TIGHT BUDGETS NEXT YEAR. TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE RECOMMEND YOU CONTINUE TO RELY UPON A MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M GOING SPENDING. DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THE EXACT SAME AS WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BUT WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS A REASONABLE STARTING POINT. I WOULD RECOMMEND FUNDING A FEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME PROPOSALS. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE PROPOSALS THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. AND HAVE CLEAR OBJECTIVES AND SPENDING REQUIREMENTS. WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT MOST OF THE OTHER ONE TIME INITIATIVES- WHICH WULD FREE UP ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR OTHER EDUCATION PRIORITIES. I FINALLY WE RECOMMEND USING THE BULK OF THAT ONE TIME FUNDING TO PROVIDE FISCALLY FIT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE THINK THAT OF ALL THE OPTIONS ON THE TABLE. AND HELPING A PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO ADDRESS DISTRICTS UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES- IS THE MOST PROMISING OPTION. THAT APPROACH WOULD BOTH IMPROVE THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THE PENSION SYSTEMS. AND IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE DISTRICT COST ON A LONG TERM BASIS. IN ADDITION TO PAYING DOWN LIABILITIES WE THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER USING A PORTION OF THAT PENSION FUNDING TO REDUCE DISTRICT DISTRICT COST PACIFIC LEE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. RIGHT NOW DISTRICT PENSION RATES ARE SCHEDULED TO INCREASE NEXT YEAR ANDTHEN DROP SLIGHTLY THE YEAR AFTER THAT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE AROUND THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO SOME WITHOUT THOSE PENSION RATE INCREASES AT OUT. ELIMINATE THAT HUMP AND LLOW- PENSION COSTS TO GROW MORE SLOWLY AND STEADILY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THAT'S REALLY ARE TAKEN THE PROPOSITION AND GET BUDGET AND IN A NUTSHELL ALL OF MY COLLEAGUE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR REACTION TO THE EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS. US AIR CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AALYST'S OFFICE- PAGE NINE HAS A LIST THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY EDUCATION PROPOSALS AND SINCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALREADY DESCRIBED FEES- WE'LL JUST MOVE ALONG TO PAGE TEN. WHICH LISTS ARE ASSESSMENT INTO RECOMMENDATIONS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF OUR SUSSMAN RECOMMENDATIONS- WITH REGARD TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ON THE GOVERNOR PER PROPOSES TO PROVIDE TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AND WE THINK THE PROGRAMS UNLIKELY TO ACCOMMODATE. THIS IT TO THE SICK- ALL OF EXPANSION I'M IN THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE MORE OF THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE SLOTS AVAILABLE MADE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WILL GO AND USE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALLOCATE IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M SO WE THINK IT'S ARE RECOMMENDING A MORE MODEST EXPANSION OF A THOUSAND SLOTS. WITH REGARD TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL IT'S UNCLEAR IF THIS NEW DEPARTMENT ADDRESSES THE STATED PROBLEMS- AND WERE. IN PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE PROPOSAL LACKS DETAIL AND WE'RE AMENDING THE LEGISLATURE PROJECT THE PROPOSAL. AND WITH OUR TO THE OFFICE GRANT PROPOSAL. THIS MIGHT. A KEY BARRIER FOR JOBS AND SHOULD FOR SOME PROVIDERS WERE RECKONED HERE JUST KEEPING A DIFFERENT FUNDS TO FIGHT. GRAHAM. QUESTION PERMANENT HEY GOOD AFTERNOON WELL AS OF GOV AFFAIRS THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WILK GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT MY REMARKS GENERALLY BE BE SHORT- BUT AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND- WERE OVER- WERE OVERALL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THIS FUNDING PRESENTS- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON ENSURING AN EQUITABLE EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS A GOAL THAT CD SUPPORTS AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST OUTLINED- THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT ALIGN WITH THE CD AND THE STATE'S FOR INTENDED. ARE SOME OF THE WORK WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN. NOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH BUT THE ADMINISTRATION THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON THOSE PROPOSALS OVER THE COURSE OF THE BUDGET SEASON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS YEAH UP MISTER VARSITY. THANK YOU ALL AND LIKE TO START OFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW I. CHECKED IN WITH MY- SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT AND- THEY THEY THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT. THE COLA. A PROPOSED COLA BUT IT'S A TWO POINT TWO NINE. OR IS IT YES- IS GROSSLY INADEQUATE TO. MEET EVEN JUST THEIR JOB PROJECTED INFLATION ADJUSTED COSTS TO BEACHES MEET EXISTING COSTS. HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CONSULTED WITH. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO SEE IF- YOU KNOW WHAT RESPONSES THEY THEY THEY'VE GIVEN YOU IN TERMS OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE PROPOSED CALL. WE WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON THE CONCERNED WITH THE LOCAL- GIVEN THAT I THINK ARE PROJECTION OF THE COLOR WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER- AT LAST YEAR I'M SO THE CALL IS SET IN STATUTE. ON THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE COLOR COURSES. IT CAN BE DONE IF IT'S A PRIORITY I THINK OUR PROBLEM WITH THE WAY THE MINIMUM GUARANTEES STRUCTURES WE HAVE A LOT OF. LEARN THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND WHERE WE- LAND SO AT THE MAY AT. MAY REVISION OR CERTAINLY WILL LOOK AT THESE ALL AGAIN BUT- AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD. INDICATORS THAT MAY WOULD PROP MAY LEAD TO A LESS A TIGHTENING IN THE GUARANTEE. ALL RIGHT AND- IS- I WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO- RESPOND TO THE SAME QUESTIONS I ADDRESS TO THE SUPERINTENDENT THAT IS THAT. IN THIS TIME WHEN- MEASURE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE- TALKING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO- MADE THEIR EXISTING COSTS LIKE LAUSD OAKLAND IN SACRAMENTO- AMONG MANY OTHERS- IN THESE GOOD BUDGET TIMES ARE WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. CREATING NEW PROGRAMS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON HELPING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THEIR EXISTING COSTS SO THERE IS NOT ANY CREATION OF A NEW PROGRAMS WITH THE ON GOING FUNDS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE ARE ONE TIME PROGRAMS WITH ONE TIME FUN AND THEY'RE TARGETED. INTENSIVE INTERVENTION AND WHAT WE ALSO HEAR FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE WENT OUT ON IN OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION REFORM EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND WE SPOKE TO A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERNON IS REALLY TEACHER RETENTION- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW JUST GO TO CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP UNBEATABLE TO EDUCATE THE STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSROOM SO WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE. ISSUES IN THIS PART MORE TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AND WE USE THE ONE TIME FUNNY BECAUSE AGAIN- AS THE LA POINTED OUT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. IF THE GUARANTEE DROPS REVENUES DROP THOSE CAN BE REDUCED- AND THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. IS THAT THE ENTIRE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA DESIGNED TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH DEEP YES IT SHOULD- BUT WERE FINING AS AT THAT OVER THE EIGHT YEARS OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING PLAN THAT WE STILL HAVE POCKETS OF DEEP POVERTY AND IN THOSE DEEP ALREADY WERE SEEN DISTRICTS THAT ARE. I'M SHOWING THIS PERSISTENT- ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THIS THEY- COMMUNITY SCHOOL OPPORTUNITY GRANT IS REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT A CHILD EDUCATION IS NOT ONLY IN THE CLASSROOM BUT IT'S ALL OF THE OTHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO ACCESS EDUCATION WHEN THEY ARE IN THE CLASSROOM. SO THESE PROP THESE PROPOSALS ARE NOT RIGHT NOW OR THAT TYPE OF RAP SERVICES NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE CLASSROOM SO SOMEBODY'S TARGET INTERVENTIONS ARE TRY REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED TO GET INTO THE CLASSROOM IT AIDS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW TO GET SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND HOW. WELL HOPEFULLY. BE DECREASED ACHIEVEMENT. WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. TO ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. IN TRUMP I WOULD SAY THE SO WE'VE MADE GREAT WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN MANY AREAS AND WE ARE SEEN ACHIEVEMENT GAPS GROWS BUT WE JUST HAVE SOME PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THOSE ARE WAS STUDENTS THAT HAVE- A LOT OF. DO THEY NEED THEY NEED MORE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. WE NEED TO GIVE THEM MORE MONEY. I DON'T KNOW THE GIVING MORE MONEY IS THE ISSUE I THINK A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS MEDIATE ADDITIONAL STATE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES WITH. THAT IS MORE TARGETED. THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AT THIS POINT. CITY IN SUPPORT IS MORE MNEY. TARGETED TARGETED OKAY- WHAT WHAT IS YOUR- RESPONSE TO THE LA OWES- RECOMMENDATION THAT TO. THE LEGISLATURE REJECT MOST OF THE- ONE TIME- INITIATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT'S ONE TIME INITIATIVES TO FREE UP MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP DISTRICTS WITH ONE TIME A RELIEF TO PAY DOWN PENSION LIABILITIES. WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED EIGHT WHAT WAS SO LAST YEAR WE DID INVEST THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DOING JUST THAT YES EXACTLY OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE INVESTED NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND THE LA OWES PROPOSAL IS TO PRO TO INVEST PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. SO WE JUST KNOW THAT THAT'S A CONCERN. OUR THANK YOU. SOMEONE NUMBER LIMóN THANK YOU AT AND I WANT TO ECHO WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ECHOED ABOUT THE COLA- IT'S A BIG DEAL IT'S IMPORTANT TO WEST SO IF IT'S NOT IN PROJECTED BUDGET I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE IT EATS IT'S AN IMPORTANT. AT ELEMENT THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACHIEVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MORE BASIC ELEMENTS AS I. REVIEW AND LOOK OVER- ALL OTHER IDEAS- YOU KNOW I LIKE A LOT OF THESE ONE TIME SPENDING. CATEGORIES BUT I ALSO FIND THAT- THE START OFF AS ONE TIME BUT THEN WE'RE BACK AVING THIS CONVERSATION WILL WE FIND IT LAST YEAR- AND SO I DO WE KEEP GOING. ON AND KEEP FINDING IT SO- IN THIS DOES SEEM LIKE A LONG LIST OF ONE TIME- INITIATIVES- AND I EIGHT THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO PRIORITIZE WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ON SOME OF THESE- ALL ARE GOOD ALL I LIKE ALL I CAN LIVE WITH- HOWEVER I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN DO ALL OF THEM. I'M ON THE CHILD NUTRITION RE AT REIMBURSEMENT. IN NUMBER MORE BROADLY ON NUTRITION- TOGETHER I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER WHO'S NOT HERE AND I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALSO. I ENSURE THAT ON THE CHILD NUTRITION FRIENDS- WE ARE DOING MORE TO AT. ADVANCE AND TO THAT. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THIS IS CALIFORNIA GROUND- AND ANYTHING THAT THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT PIECE- BECAUSE WE GROW A LOT OF OUR OWN AG HERE- AND- WHILE IT'S NICE TO SAY THAT IT COULD BE A CALIFORNIA GROWN A THINK THAT IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO MEET. OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE- TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS I IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE. RECEIVING THE BEST- FROM OUR STATE SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE I THINK IT'S WERE THERE. A CONSIDERING. OKAY SIR DONALD. THANK YOU ALL JUST KIND OF DOUG GO THROUGH A FEW THINGS HERE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND- JUST GET A DRAWING ON THE RESERVE THE PER- IT IS KIND OF A CONCERN TO ME AND THE TIME LIKE THIS- AGAIN THE COLA HER MAKES PRESS. PURSE STRIPPERS I KNOW THAT AND ALL WE WANT TO SEE OF THE LARGER GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT TO THE ASSEMBLY THERE WAS WHAT IT TO YOUR COME. OF EIGHT THREE POINT THREE BILLION TOTAL FUNK. READING MY MOTHER PAYMENT THIS YEAR YES BUT I'VE WE RENAME AND IF I'M NOT AT THIS YEAR PAYMENT UP I THINK I'D BE GREAT BECAUSE AGAIN THAT. THAT THAT THAT PUSHES DOWN THOSE OUT YOUR COSTS- AND AGAIN THAT'S- PROBABLY MORE GENERAL FUND DISCUSSION THE NINETY EIGHT BUT- STILL- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR. ONE YEAR FOR ONE EFFORT. I WAS A RADIO. UNDER THAT UMBRELLA BUT JUST THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. AND HAVING BEEN IN A SCHOOL FOR MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN A LOT OF MONEY COME. I DON'T KNOW IF IT ALWAYS AND- THE WHITES FACTIONS ARE. CAUTIOUS PUTTING PUSHING OUT TOO MUCH- TOO FAST YOUR MAY EXPRESS. ABOUT THE C. C. E. THE CALIFORNIA CLAPPER WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA I DID THIS AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CREATED THE WHICH IS A GOOD THING. I JUST LIKE TO SEE MORE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND- WHO OVERSEES I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THAT ON THAT MODEL THERE- AND THEN ON THE SPECIALIST PROPOSAL I MEAN THERE THERE'S A GOOD START THERE WE HAVE SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE MORE MA- MODERATE TO SEVERE STUDENTS. SHOULD THERE BE A WAITED FOR ME OF SOME FASHION. ALONG WITH EQUALIZATION EFFORTS AS WELL- THERE SOME STUDIES IN THERE I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. STUDIES AND I WAS TALK ABOUT HOLDING UP MONEY FOR NEXT YEAR. TO IMPLEMENT. THE DID YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT SIMPLEMENT SOME OF THE INFORMATION GARNERED FROM ONE OF THE STUDIES THAT MAKING SENSE. SO THERE'S TWO HUNDRED. YEAH YEAH THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FOR PRESCHOOL EARLY INTERVENTION AND GRANTS AND THAT MONEY- IS ONE TIME A GOING OUT A ONE TIME COVER THE INTENT IS THAT IT WILL BE ON GOING IN AND INCLUDED IN THE NEXT PHASE OF THE FORMULA ON BUT THERE ARE SOME STUDIES GOING ON RIGHT THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET. SPCIAL EDUCATION RELATED TO KINDA HELP INFORM WHERE WE MOVE ON ARE WORTH FAR MORE PAYING FOR THESE STUDIES ARE NOT HAVING SOME ONE CALL FOUNDATIONS GARNER ALL THIS MONEY I GET KINDA CONCERNED WEAVING WE WANTED ID WE SHOULD PAY THAT SAY I WANT SOMEBODY ELSE MY- ULTIMATE CONTROL WHAT THAT STAY LOOKS LIKE HAVING THIS VENTURE AS WELL. COULD TO A WORKER AND THIS IN ONE STUDY IS A STUDY CURRENTLY GOING ON- THE PRIVATE COMMISSION WITH PRIVATE FUNDS BY WEST ADD THAT IS LOOKING AT STATE EDUCATION FUNDING AND WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE IN MANY YEARS THE SUSPECT OF WHO'S INVOLVED BECAUSE I REALLY THINK.

THAT THOSE WILL BE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD- WELL. OKAY THAT I THINK MISTER MURATSUCHI DID ALLUDE ON THE OPPORTUNITY GRANTS IS NOT WHAT. OUR CONSERVE OUR OUR SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS ARE FOR- THAT'LL BUT AGAIN ONLY A POINT OF A CONVERSATION AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY. THANK YOU CAN I GO BACK TO THE LA ON YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO. IT'S THE ONE BILLION PUT IT IS THAT ONGOING OR FOR ONE TIME MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CARBON FINES PROPOSALS ONE TIME PROPOSALS BUT WITH ON GOING POP NINETY EIGHT MONEY SO OKAY AS YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER NIXING THOSE AND USE THOSE FOR THINGS LIKE. PENSION FINANCES ARE YOU PROPOSING THAT. JUST A ONE TIMER LOOKING ONLINE. SIX SO THE ONE THE ONE BILLION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THAT IS RELATED TO ONE TIME FUNDS AND SOME OF THAT IS RELATED TO ON GOING FUNDS IT'S PULLING FROM DIFFERENT THE PROPOSAL'S ESCORT TO DIFFERENT YEARS SOME SCORES TO THE BUDGET YEARS SOME TO PREVIOUS YEARS. I THINK WE ENVISION THE PENSION PAY DOWN BEING A ONE TIME PROPOSAL- JUST GIVEN THAT IT'S RESPONDING SPECIFICALLY TO SOME OF THE COST PRESSURES DISTRICTS ARE FACING. KIND OF RIGHT NOW AND IN THIS COMING YEAR WHO. OKAY. PARTIALLY ADDRESSES THAT OKAY WELL THANK YOU THIS THIS OF COURSE IS OUR OVERVIEW WILL DIG INTO THESE ISSUES- MUCHMORE IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS AND- WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY WE'LL GET TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT SO HE PLEASE LINE AT- IN THE MIDDLE AND PLEASE KEEP YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT TO SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS.

LOOK FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- TIED FOR DEEP CONNECTIONS AND COMMUNITIES ON WHAT WORKS BEST FOR SIX MILLION PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS- ESPECIALLY THOSE EXPERIENCING POVERTY IN TRAUMA- RESEARCH BACKS WHAT WE ALL INTUITIVELY KNOW WRAPPING KIDS IN NEEDED SUPPORTS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE- PUT THEM ON THE BEST YOUR DIRECTORY IN LIFE- AND WE WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT IN THIS CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AN OPPORTUNITY GRANTS- THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT CBO'S PLATE IN WRAPPING STUDENTS- AND FAMILIES IN THOSE SERVICES AND NOT HAVING TO NECESSARILY IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL DOLLARS FOR DIRECT SERVICES BUT TAPPING INTO THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE WILLINGNESS OF PARTNER IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. TO COME IN RAP THOSE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES PORTS I WE DO BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENTS LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND HEALTHY START- ARE REALLY THE WAY TO GET TO A TARGETED AN INTENTIONAL- INTERVENTION- AND WE ARE EAGER TO CONTINUE THE- CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING STERILE ALYSSA TEACH PLUS- AND WE APPRECIATE THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT BOTH- ADDRESSING OUR UNDERLYING FISCAL CHALLENGES AS WELL AS REALLY LOOKING AT. SOME OF THE DUST UP Q. LEVERS FOR ADDRESSING OPPORTUNITY MAY GAPS. AND WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT MAKING SURE WE HAVE A WELL PREPARED WELL SUPPORTED DIVERSE TEACHER WHAT TEACHER WORK FORCES ONE OF THE GREATEST DRIVERS. OF ADDRESSING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE A LOT OF THE INVESTMENTS. THEY ALSO WERE EXCITED TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT INVESTING IN WHAT WORKS I THINK WE HAVE CHALLENGES AND KNOW WHAT WORKS. ON AND SO WE WOULD SUPPORT AT WITH ALONG WITH SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS WE REALLY BUILD UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THESE FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING SO- HAVING MORE MEANINGFUL EVALUATION. BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE CTC TO SUPPORT SOME OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HAVING THE SUSTAINABLE AND IMPACT THAT WE HAVE HOPE FOR. AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT DIVERSIFYING OUR TEACHING FORCE LET'S BE EXPLICIT. LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THAT IS A GOAL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE MEASURING- AND THEN WE JUST ALSO WANT TO REINFORCE THE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT ALL CFF IS WORKING THAT IS ADDRESSING THE OPPORTUNITY.

SO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CONGRADULATIONS ERIN NICE TO SEE ON THE SIDE. PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. FIRST OF ALL JUST WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE PRIORITIES THEY'VE SET OUT- TO ADJUST THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S SUPPORT ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AS WELL AS LCF. LAKE HAS TRADITIONALLY SUPPORTED- EFFORTS TO INCREASE. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THAT TARGETS AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. BUT WE THINK AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. MICHAEL HAS A PILOT RIGHT NOWWE HAVE FIFTEEN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WE'VE PARTNERED WITH BOTH THE COUNTY. AS WELL AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHERS. TO A DROP. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO. WE REALLY NEED TO ADDRESS THE WHOLE CHILD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON FOR MANY YEARS WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A PRIORITY OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- ENTITIES. AND WE THINK TO SOMETHING WE CAN DO. WELL IT INCREASE. AT TEN FUNDING THANKS VERY MUCH. SUBJECT CLOSE MY A COMPLIMENT I APPRECIATE THAT WERE WERE LOOKING TO. SOME NINETY DOLLARS TO THE THAT'S PROPER NEED FOR THE PURPOSE THERE'S OTHER THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN TO LIKE ELLIE A BILLING. ALL THOSE COMETA CALYX ADDRESS THERE'S SOME OTHER. DYNAMICS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS- AS A LEGISLATURE AS WELL. THANK YOU. DINEEN MICHELETTI CULVER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- THAT WERE MADE TODAY IN THE GOVERNOR'S. OF JANUARY PROPOSED BUDGET WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO SHORE UP EXISTING PROGRAMS- IN DOING NOT. ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET RECEIVE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE SLOTS LET ME PUT IN CONTEXT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS OF ONLY RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SLOTS. ROUGHLY TOTAL TODAY WE SIR FEWER THAN SIXTY THOUSAND IN THE WORKING POOR PROGRAM YET THE NUMBER OF INCOME ELIGIBLE HAS SURGED OVER TWO MILLION. THAT PROGRAM SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN REGARDS TO THE COLA IT'S HOLY- IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. SO IN OUR PROGRAMS ARE WAS PROPOSED A TWO POINT 29% COLA. BUT IN THE SAME TOKEN. THERE WAS AN ADJUSTMENT OF CAP PRO- FOR CAP PROGRAMS ELIMINATING TWO POINT OH ONE PERCENT. SO WE'RE NOT EVEN GETTING THE BASIC TWO POINT 29% COLA. IN REGARDS TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT WE THINK IT'S A GOOD POINT FOR CONVERSATION. BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT THE OTHER PROGRAMS SUCH AS HOT AS A TEAM TRAUMA INFORMED CARE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ALSO TOUCH HOMELESSNESS. IN THE SAME CONVERSATIONS IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT IF YOU FINALLY RATES HAVE TO BE AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR CURRENT LEVELS NOT AT TWENTY SIXTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI GOOD EVENING- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL NEED A B. C. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS- WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT TEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL STATE PRESCHOOL- SLOTS AS PART OF THE THREE OR GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THEIR SPACES SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE INCREASE OF SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE INFANT AND TODDLER SLOTS IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH FOR THE NEED AND CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER INCREASE AS WE START TALKING- A- FEW- FURTHER PROPOSALS- IT WOULD AGREE SOME OF THE OTHER SIDE. SENTIMENTS NOT SOMETHING I WOULD NORMALLY TALK ABOUT BUT CERTAINLY THE COLA IS NOT SUFFICIENT ALSO FOR OUR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WE DO KNOW WE DEFINITELY HAVE A REIMBURSEMENT I'M RIGHT CRISIS- IN THIS STATE. IN REGARDS TO THE- PROPOSAL THE NEW DEPARTMENT ON EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT MY ORGANIZATION HAS NOT YET TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. HOWEVER WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGE AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE A WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES HERE BUT AS YOU SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS WHAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL FOR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES AND ENSURING WE ARE- MEETING THE NEEDS. OF THOSE ARE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN OUT IN THE STATE AND NECESSARILY ADMINISTRATIVE NEEDS ARE PROFESSIONAL SO I THINK YOU. FAIR ABOUT JUST AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS VERY APPRECIATIVE THE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE PROPERLY SERVE. WE MUST BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN. THE NECESSARY STUFF WHICH REALLY IS ADDRESSING AND COMPENSATION. AND WHAT COMES WITH THAT WHICH IS INCREASING COST TO PENSION SO WE WILL REALLY DO. APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION THAT WITHIN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM- UNFORTUNATELY ARE ALL CFF TIED TO A TWO POINT TWO NINE. A COLA WHICH WE HAD BEEN ANTICIPATING IT TO BE 3% IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DOES LEAD TO. CONVERSATIONS I VALLEY A LEVEL OF REDUCTIONS AND SO WE- HOPE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS ACCESS TO ANY AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI A GOOD EVENING IT'S GOT MORE I'M WITH COULD ANGLO- WE SERVE THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN- WITH PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE IN THE BAY AREA. AND I JUST WANTED TO VOICE OUR STRONG. SUPPORT FOR THE CREE OF A NEW. EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE PROGRAMS THAT ARE HOLISTIC THAT SERVE THE WHOLE CHILD. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT EDUCATION IT'S THAT IT'S MORE THAN JUST EDUCATION- WHEN WE CAN BRING TOGETHER FUNDING STREAMS. THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO GET NOT JUST THE CHILD CARE THEY NEED. BUT ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY NEED. OUR OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO ENROLL IN FIVE SIX SEVEN DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THAT'S THE KIND OF CHANGE THAT- WE SUPPORT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THANK YOU. HARD TO FOLLOW SCOTT. GOOD ABOUT GOOD AFTERNOON PUTTING HER ON BEHALF OF EARLY EDUCATOR FOR NOW I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE SUPPORT THAT- SCOTT FOR ME KIDDING GO- OFFERED- WITH RESPECT TO THE DIP CREATION OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT WE HEAR THE CONCERNS FROM THE FIELD- ABOUT AND MAKING SURE THAT SERVICES AND PROGRAMS TO FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE NOT DISRUPTED AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT WE'RE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE IDEA THAT- THE NEW DEPARTMENT SHOULD HOUSE MORE THAN CHILD CARE THAT WE SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT THE AT. THE TOTALITY OF SERVICES THAT SUPPORT- HEALTHY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT AS WELL WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS TO WE THINK THAT THIS IS A- THE RIGHT VISION FOR CALIFORNIA AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE SUPPORT IT. GOOD AFTERNOON BEVERLY YOU ON BEHALF OF YOU TO THE ASK ME LOCAL THREE NINE THIRTY- WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE MINISTRATIONS CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING EASY PROGRAMS. WE WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE CAN BE BENEFITS ASKS THE- SB I POINTED OUT TODAY. A WITH STREAMLINING A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS UNDER ONE COMPREHENSIVE DEPARTMENT. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE. WILL BE A LOT OF WORK IN COORDINATION NEEDED FOR THIS ENDEAVOR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS TOPIC. AND WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE CHAIR. COMMENT AROUND MAKING SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON THE LINES OF THE FAMILY CHILD AND PROVIDERS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RON RAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. PHILOSOPHICALLY WE SUPPORT MANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ARE A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS AND THIS BUDGET BUT IT IS A BALANCING ACT. OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS INCREASING THE BASE GRANT- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IN ORDER TO DO THAT AS MANY OF THE MEMBERS MENTIONED- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT REVENUE. AND TALK ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE REVENUE SIGNIFICANTLY WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT INCREASING THE COAL- WE THINK THAT'S TOO LOW I THINK BEYOND THAT WE NEED TO INVEST IN WHAT WORKS WHAT WE KNOW WORKS WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF THE TEACHER RECRUITMENT RICK RETENTION PROPOSALS. WE DO KNOW THAT THE CLASSIFIED SCHOOLING EMPLOYEE TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROGRAM WORKS WE HAVE DATA ON THAT WE SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THAT- WE ALSO KNOW THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WORK- WORK- IF HE'S BEEN A LEADER IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS NATIONALLY AND SEE UP HE'S BEEN A LEADER IN. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MONEY CRENNEL'S ON BEHALF OF THE EASY COALITION. WOULD LIKE TO SAY WE APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR DID PROVIDE HIS BUDGET FOR PRESCHOOL SPACES- INCLUDING. A LIMITED NUMBER OF A P. SPACES WITH THE PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS- BUT WE THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE INVEST MORE WE HAVE OVER TWO MILLION CHILDREN AND WHO HAVE NEED IN THE STATE KNOWLEDGE ABILITY. WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO ADDRESS SYSTEMATIC- INCREASES IN THE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S A ABILITY TO- WILLINGNESS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND LOOK FOR TO SPEAKING AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS- INDICATOR ACHO NOW WITH SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- INTO YOUR COMMENTS MISTER MERRETT TO EACH THROUGH T. POLLOCK EYES. WE WOULD AGREE THAT EL CFF IS THE POLICY A VERY IMPORTANT POLICY TO CLOSE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. I AND WE WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE WORKING. TOWARDS THAT GOAL- WE SHARE A LOT OF THE GOALS THAT ARE ARTICULATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. OB BUT WE DO HAVE DEEP CONCERNS I IN AN URGENCY IN THE WAY THAT THE PROPOSAL'S OUR STRUCTURE. WE FEEL THAT IT REALLY LIMITS OUR CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO. FINANCIALLY PLAN AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE DO HAVE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. I IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND SOME CHANGES WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE FIRST ONE BEING THAT WE WILL LOOK TO SEE ALLOCATION ON SPECIAL ED- BASED ON WATER IN SEVERE THIS. OF STUDENTS LIKE THAT THE LA HAS PROVIDER REPORT. ON WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN SPECIAL ED SO THAT WE THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. TERMS OF ALL OF THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO PROVIDE THOSE. ANA ABA BASIS STATE WIDE. AND FINALLY TO LAST ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE COLA SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IT'S ESTIMATING A SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION. DOLLAR REDUCTION IN. A WITH THE TWO POINT 29% COLON THINK WE BELIEVE GOING BACK WOULD BE IMPORTANT. AND ONE TIME PENSION PAYMENTS AS WELL THANK IN THE- GOOD AFTERNOON ERICA HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. I'LL JUST KIND OF SAD I ALIGNED MYSELF WITH A VARIETY OF THE COMMENTS BEING SAID ESPECIALLY THOSE MISTER MERRETT CG WITH REGARDS TO LC FF. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH A LOT OF THE- COMPETITIVE GRANT TYPES OF THINGS THE GOVERNOR DOES HAVE IN HIS BUDGET. WE GET A LOT OF WINNERS AND LOSERS THOSE ARE ONLY GOING TO GO TO A COUPLE DISTRICTS. EVERYBODY'S GOT THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IF YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE SOMEWHAT FARING GIVE DISTRICTS A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE. THAT DOES NEED TO BE KIND OF DOWN ON A MUCH MORE GLOBAL BASIS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SOMETHING ADDRESS TO THE PENSIONS HOWEVER NOT OUT OF NINETY EIGHT FUNDS- BECAUSE THAT FRANKLY JUST THAN WE DEBT REDUCES FOR THE PROGRAM OFFERINGS FOR KIDS. AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD THOUGH TO THE DISCUSSIONS COMING UP I WITH REGARDS TO THE SPECIAL AT PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS RACHEL'S CONSUMERS ARE WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR KEEPING THE COMMITMENT OR EQUITY FUNDING FORMULA LC A FAST. HONORING PROP NINETY EIGHT THIS WAY IS NOT A GIVEN WE APPRECIATE IT. AND AS ALL OF KNOWLEDGE HERE OUR SYSTEM IS AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED TO MEET THE TASK OF SERVING OUR- STUDENTS- LIKE OTHER PUBLIC SERVANTS. IN CALIFORNIA THE DEBT WE OWE SCHOOL STAFF AND RETIREMENT EMMETT BENEFITS SHOULD NOT BE PAID OUT OF THE SCARCE FUNDING WE COVER FOR EDUCATION BUT FROM THE GENERAL FUND THE STATE CAN. COLLECT SMALL CALIFORNIANS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO FLUSH OUT THE PROPOSAL'S ON I'LL SEE IF OF TRANSPARENCY. WE AGRE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR. BUT SIMPLY TRACKING MONEY DOES NOT MAKE A CATEGORICAL. FINALLY SINCE I'LL SEE OF UP IS BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY FOCUSED ON PREPARING IN DEVELOPING OUR TEACHERS. WE IDENTIFY TEACHERS THE STATE PRIORITY NUMBER ONE BUT DIDN'T FIND IT. WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL FOR TO IMPROVE OUR TEACHER WORK FIRST OUR ROOT CAUSES. TO ADDRESSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST CONCERN FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANT STUDENTS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO BEAR THE BRUNT OF AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED TEACHERS AND GETTING HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS TO THEIR SCHOOLS SHOULD BE THE FOCUS OF OUR STATE'S EFFORTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

BUT I JUST KNOW TODAY- I THINK YOUR DISCUSSION HAS. I LIKE THE PHRASE THAT- MISTER RAP USE THAT A BALANCING ACT. ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THAT WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON EDUCATOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WE THINK THEY WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF MANY STUDENTS OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL TELL YOU IN THE COUNTY THAT- THAT THAT IS NOT THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM FISCAL PRESSURES AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION ON THINGS LIKE A- A PENSION RELIEF- A PROPOSAL OR OTHER AREAS THAT GIVE THEM A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY. TO DETERMINE BASED ON THEIR THEIR OWN PRIORITIES THE BEST USE OF THE PHONES DOLLARS. AND WILL CONTINUE THAT THAT CONVERSATION AS A SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS J'AI SUPPRESS IT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. FIRST ONE WITH A THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR A GREAT FRAME WITH THAT HIS ISSUED IN THIS GENERAL BUDGET.

DOCTOR TRAINING FUNDS OF ANY THAT YOU SET ASIDE GO TO CERTIFICATES AS WELL AS CLASSIFY STAFF. WERE THE FIRST THE LAST AND STUDENTS TYPICALLY WILL SEE AT THE SCHOOL SITE AND WE HAVE EVERY ISSUE FOR HEALTH CARE OF TO SCALE WE HAVE NOW. AND HOW MEMBERS THE DOES CONSERVE TRAINING TO SAFETY TO ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ISSUES THAT OUR MEMBERS AND STUDENTS FAMILIES FACE. FINALLY WE ALSO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR.

THAT ARE PART OF THE COLLEGE FOR ALL COALITION. AND WE'RE HERE TO ASK THAT YOU. REINVEST IN THE COLLEGE READINESS BLOCK GRANT. AS YOU MAY KNOW IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE ALLOCATED RESOURCES ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS OVER THREE YEARS. IN TARGETING SUPPORT FOR OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS AND HELPING THEM BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY. FOR COLLEGE AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS TO DO THINGS LIKE. COVER TEST EXAM FEES FOR BOTH ADMISSIONS AND A. P. TESTS HELP MORE STUDENTS ACCESS TO A TO G. COLLEGE READINESS CURRICULUM. AND INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF COUNSELING SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES- HOWEVER AS I KNOW MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE. THERE ARE STILL PERSISTENT RACIAL EQUITY GAPS THAT WE MUST ADDRESS- HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE ONLY GRADUATED 37% OF OUR LET THE NEXT MALES. AND 33% OF OUR BLACKS MALES AS COLLEGE READY- THIS REALLY CALLS ATTENTION TO THE NEED TO INVEST IN THESE. TARGETED SERVICES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN DOING SO. THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MRS CHEN MEMBERS MY NAME IS POSH UNDER THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION- HERE ON BEHALF OF THE U. SEASON ASSOCIATION DOESN'T HAVE. AS A PART OF THE COLLEGE- FOR ALL POLLUTION. TO ASK FOR AND RESPOND REINVESTMENT INTO THE COLLEGE RENDON'S BLOCK GRANT- BECAUSE WE SEE THAT AS ESSENTIAL TO PROMOTING DIVERSITY IN EQUITY OUR CAMPUSES. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN- WE USING THESE PROGRAM TO YOU SEE WAS ABLE TO YOU. ARE CREATE A LOT OF LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS- THAT ARE UNDER RESOURCES UNDERFUNDED. ARE TO PROVIDE MUCH ESSENTIAL OUR RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO THE STUDENTS ON THOSE SCHOOLS. ARE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE THERE FOR THEM TO PREPARE THEM FOR COLLEGE. AND SO- THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY ESSENTIAL AND CAN PROVIDING THAT SERVICE BUT THEY WHAT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PRESS THIS WITHOUT. ADDITIONAL ONGOING INVESTMENTS SO- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AND WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT REIMBURSEMENT- THIS YEAR WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR. OF STUDENTS WHO WERE ASI RBG SUPPORTED WHO ARE GOING TO BE WALKING ACROSS THE GRADUATION STAGE AND WE WANTED TO BE NOT THE LAST. THANK YOU. CAN REALLY RESUME REST SOMEPLACE INTERNATIONAL UNION WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF EDUCATION COALITION IS ONE TO THROW THAT IN- AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WERE. OVERLOOKED WE WERE JUST WE NOT TO SEE MODERATE TO SEVERE A SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDED WE BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY ABOUT A NEED THAT SCHOOLS ARE. KIND OF DYING ON THE VINE FIND FUNDING BUT IT'S ALSO AN EQUITY ISSUE AS WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME AND THEY'RE SO. IF WE'RE ABLE TO FUND SEVERE TO MODERATE WE STOP CANNIBALIZING THE BEES WHICH STOPS CANNIBALIZING LC FF SO WE DO THINK THAT OVERALL IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT YOUR DOLLARS- I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE POINTS ON THE NUTRITION WE AGREE WITH THE LOCAL PRODUCE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IT'S AN ACCESS ISSUE. WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE IN ROLLING FOR FEAR- IN FOR YOU REDUCED PRICE LUNCH- WE'RE SEEING A DECLINE THERE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T HAVE HUNGRY STUDENTS. SO WE THINK THOSE DOLLARS TO REALLY LOOK AT ACCESS A SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING BREAKFAST LUNCH AND SUPPER THEY'VE BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL INSURING THAT KIDS GO HOME WITH A FULL BELLY WHEN WE ENCOURAGE YOU GUYS TO RECONSIDER- WHERE THOSE DOLLARS GO. AND WE ALSO INTO HOW I LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IS ONE THAT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART- AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FELT WAS OVERLOOKED WAS THE INCLUSION OF COUNTY SERVICES. THEY CAN ENSURE THAT FAMILY AND FRIENDS BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE NEED INCLUDING MEDIC HEALTH AND HOW FRESH. BUT AS I SAID EVELYN LETTER WILL REACH OUT WITH YOU GUYS THINKING YOU VERY MUCH.
