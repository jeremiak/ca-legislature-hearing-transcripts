WE'RE GONNA GET WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED IN ONE SECOND OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON WE'RE HERE TO GET STARTED WITH THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION AN ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SIX HEARING ON THE- CALIFORNIA LOTTERY. WE WANTED TO ALLOW THE UP TO HAVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THE LOTTERY IS A PARTICULAR FROM LA OUT AS WELL AS OUR NEW DIRECTOR MISTER JOHNSON TO DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY. ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE HERE IS TO JUST RE EXAM AND THE- INCOME OF LOTTERY WHICH HAS GONE UP AT THE SAME TIME THE PERCENTAGE OF MONEY GOING TOWARDS EDUCATION HAS GONE DOWN SO WE DID WANT TO. KIND OF UNDERSTAND AGAIN SENSE AB ONE FORTY TWO WENT INTO A FACT THE IMPACTS ON ON BOTH SALES BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF EDUCATION FUNDING WORKED WITH SOME SOME OF THE DIRECT IMPACTS ON. SO THIS TIME THE ME JUST SEE IF THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DÃ­AS. FOR MANY OF THE MEMBERS. SURELY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TING FOR CONVENE THIS IMPORTANT TIMELY INFORMATION HERE IN THE STATE LOTTERY CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THE STAFF WORK IN PREPARING US FOR THIS OUR STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FOR PREFERRING OVERVIEW LOTTERIES MISSION OPERATIONS AND ALSO WELCOME OUR OLD FRIEND AND NEW COLLEAGUE IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY OF A JOHNSON TO THE NEW DIRECTOR OF THE STATE LOTTERY AS WELL AS JOHN FITZ PATRICK WITH THE PROPER FINANCE THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING. CERTAINLY THE CHAIRMAN TOUCHED ON SEVERAL. ITEMS RAISED. OF INTEREST. I'D LIKE TO DIG INTO THOSE ALONG WITH US MEMBERS BUT ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT BE MORE EFFICIENT GOING FOR NOW WE HAVE THE HOW SHE BILL SOME YEARS AGO. TO KIND OF REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PUT MORE MONEY INTO PRIZES THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS RESULT AS I UNDERSTAND IT. IS AND THE SAME CLIP OR RATE OF GROWTH FOR BOTH EDUCATION AND REVENUES BUT IT DOES AS I UNDERSTAND PROVIDE OVERALL. GREATER MONIES IN BOTH AREAS SO LOOK FORWARD TO DELVING INTO DETAILS THAT AND WELCOME EVERYBODY THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING TODAY'S HERE. THANK YOU. SEE SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS WE WERE GOING TO START WITHOUT HIM. OF HIS LATE THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY DALY IT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE STAFF **** TO PREPARE A HANDOUT WHICH I BELIEVE ARE IN YOUR PACKETS. AND WILL BE USING THAT AS A GUIDE FOR OUR COMMENTS TODAY. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WILL FOR START OFF WITH SOME BACKGROUND. MISSION THIRTY SEVEN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AMENDED THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO AUTHORIZE STATE LOTTERY THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE PROVISIONS WITH A BILL THAT IS ENACTED BY TWO THIRDS OF MEMBERS OF BOTH HOUSES. THE PROPOSITION AUTHORIZED A VARIETY OF GAMES TO BE OFFERED THEY CAN INCLUDES GAMES WHERE I YOU CAN INSTANTLY WHEN VERSES WITH OTHERS WHERE YOU SELECTION NUMBERS. THERE ARE ALSO GAMES THAT ARE MULTI STATE GAMES. THE PROPOSITION ALSO CREATED A FIVE MEMBER LOTTERY COMMISSION. TO OVERSEE THE OPERATIONS OF THE LOTTERY. THE COMMISSIONERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. AS OF TWO THOUSAND TEN STATE LAW DOES REQUIRE AT LEAST 87% OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL LOTTERY SALES REVENUES BE USED FOR PRIZES OR TO SUPPORT EDUCATION WITH AT LEAST 50% OF THAT GOING TO PRICES. ADDITIONALLY NO MORE THAN 13% MAYBE SPENT ON LOTTERY ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WHICH DOES INCLUDE BOTH PERSONAL COST AS WELL AS RETAILER INCENTIVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. TO DATE THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE INDUSTRY IS ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS INTO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE OFFERING LOTTERY PRODUCTS. AFTER WINNINGS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE INDUSTRY GENERATED ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION OF THAT WENT TO EDUCATION AND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION WENT TO SUPPORT LOTTERY EXPENSES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT THIS IS A TABLE THAT SHOWS THAT LOTTERY SALES AND EXPENDITURES HAVE INCREASED STEADILY OVER THE PAST. TEN YEARS THERE JUST A COUPLE KEY THINGS THAT I WOULD POINT OUT AND BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION. FIRST IN TERMS OF SALES AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE ARE AT SEVEN BILLION THAT IS AN INCREASE OF FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OR- A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. OVER THE TEN YEARS. IN TERMS OF PRIZES PRICES HAVE GONE UP BY ABOUT THREE BILLION OR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAVE GONE UP BY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION OR A HUNDRED AND 10% AND EDUCATION HAS GONE UP BY SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN MILLION OR 63% TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE TALKED ABOUT EDUCATION. ALSO INCREASING OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THIS PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF WHERE THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED BY THE DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL AND CITIES. AND YOU CAN SEE ON THIS CHART THAT ABOUT 80% OF THE FUNDING. ON AND ON ANY ARE GO THROUGH CASE TO. EXCUSE ME K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. THE LOTTERY REVENUE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND THEY'RE BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OR THE EQUIVALENT FULL TIME ENROLLMENTS. TURNING TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO EDUCATION INCREASING WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE SHARE OF LOTTERY SALES GOING TO EDUCATION HAS DECLINED. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE FIGURE BEFORE YOU ON THIS PAGE AND SPECIFICALLY THE AMOUNT TO GOING TO EDUCATION HAS DECREASED FROM THIRTY FOUR POINT 7% IN 200-091-0220 THREE POINT 8% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. ON THE FLIP SIDE THE AMOUNT GOING TO PRIZES HAS INCREASED FROM 52% IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THE NEXT TWO PAGES OF YOUR HAND OUT PAGES FIVE AND SIX. PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED BREAK DOWN ON THE USE OF EDUCATION FUNDS. SO THE FIRST THING TO NOTE HERE IS THAT THERE ARE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS THAT DICTATES HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE USED. PROPOSITION THIRTY SEVEN DID PROVIDE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WITH QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THEY COULD USE THE FINES BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE USED FOR THE EDUCATION OF STUDENTS. IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ACQUIRING PROPERTY CONSTRUCTING FACILITIES ORIFICE OR FINANCING RESEARCH. OPPOSITION TWENTY WHICH WAS AN ACT IN TWO THOUSAND PLACE TO SOME ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND REQUIRED THAT THEY USE A PORTION OF THEIR FUNDING WHICH IS CURRENTLY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. THE CIVIC LEE FOR BOOKS AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURE THE PIE CHART IN FRONT OF YOU ON THIS PAGE YOU'LL SEE THAT FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. THEY GENERALLY USE MOST OF THEIR LOTTERY FINDINGS FOR TEACHER SALARIES AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AFTER YOU SET ASIDE THE- THE MANDATORY KIND OF SPENDING ANY LOOK AT THEIR DISCRETIONARY PORTION. THEY GENERALLY USE THAT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS AND TO FIND STUDENT SERVICES SUCH AS COUNSELING. FOR THE UNIVERSITIES THEY GENERALLY ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO THEIR CAMPUSES THE CSU DOES RETAIN ABOUT 25% OF THE FUNDING FOR SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES. WHEN IT GOES TO THE CAMPUS IS THE CAMPUSES TEND TO USE THE FUNDING FOR VARIOUS PRIORITIES WHICH INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS REPLACING INSTRUCTURE INSTRUCTIONAL EQUIPMENT AND PURCHASING LIBRARY MATERIALS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR HAND OUT WE DID TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW QUITE A BIT OF MONEY OF BILLION THE OVER BILLION DOLLARS GOING TO EDUCATION HOWEVER ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DID WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT. A LOTTERY FUNDS DO REPRESENT A SMALL SHARE OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO EDUCATION ESSENTIALLY LESS THAN PROVIDE THAT BREAK DOWN BY ENTITY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT RANGES FROM 005% FOR YOU SEE TO ABOUT ONE POINT. SEVEN CENTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR HAND OUT. THERE ARE VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT THAT'S GENERATED FOR EDUCATION. AND HERE WE LAY OUT ABOUT SEVEN OF THE MAJOR FACTORS. THAT CAN IMPACT THAT. THE FIRST FACTOR RELATES TO THE TYPES AND VARIETY OF GAMES THAT ARE OFFERED. AND THAT REALLY. APPEALS TO DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF. CUSTOMERS AND SO THIS WOULD IMPACT WHETHER AND- WHETHER OR NOT NEW CUSTOMERS WERE ACQUIRED AS WELL AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH EXISTING CUSTOMERS WOULD PLAY THE GAMES. THE SECOND FACTOR RELATES TO PUT HIS STRUCTURE AND PRIZE AMOUNTS AND SIMILARLY YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO APPEAL TO DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS OF CUSTOMERS. AND CUSTOMER WILLINGNESS WILL REALLY THAN DEPEND ON HOW ATTRACTIVE THEY FIND THE PRICE. THE THIRD FACTOR IS THE EASE OF PURCHASING HOW EASY IS IT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS AND SO THAT WILL THEN DICTATE CUSTOMER WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY DO SELL. THE FOUR AFTER IS RELATED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PLAYER EXPERIENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE HOW EASY IS IT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WINS TO THEN GET THEIR PAY OUT. ESSENTIALLY THIS SIMILARLY WOULD IMPACT THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PLAY A GAME AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THEY PLAY. THE FACTOR RELATES TO THE AMOUNT SPENT ON MARKETING. THE AMOUNT THAT SPENT ON MARKETING CERTAINLY CAN INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND THEREBY GENERATE ADDITIONAL SALES A MORE IS MORE PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN PREVENT. A PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS HOWEVER AT SOME POINT THERE IS A THRESHOLD THAT IS REACHED WHERE ANY ADDITIONAL MONIES THAT POINT IN MAY NO LONGER ACQUIRE. NEW CUSTOMERS OR MAY NOT GENERATE ADDITIONAL SALES AT THE SAME RATE THAT IT HAD DONE SO IN THE PAST. THE SIXTH ISSUE RELATES TO A TELLER INCENTIVES THAT RETAILERS HAVE INCENTIVES AND THE VERY BY LOTTERY PRODUCT BUT THAT WILL REALLY KIND OF DETERMINE HOW WILLING RETAILERS ARE TO OFFER THE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS TO PROMOTE THEM. THE FINAL FACTOR THIS PAGE IT RELATES TO RESPONSIBLE AND PROBLEM GAMING PROVISIONS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE STATE AND THE COMMISSION HAVE BEEN KIND OF REALLY. FORCEFUL AND THINK THAT IT IS A PRIORITY BUT THIS WILL THAT IMPACT SOME OF THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE DISCUSS THE FOR EXAMPLE HOW EASY IT IS FOR INDIVIDUAL TO IS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND OUT IN TOTAL THESE FACTORS REALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT THAT'S GENERATED FOR EDUCATION IN TWO WAYS ONE IS THAT IT CAN INCREASE THE TOTAL POT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S COMING IN. THE SECOND WAY THAT IT CAN CREE SAID IS THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE MAY NOT CHANGE. THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO DISTRIBUTION CAN INCREASE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU BRING DOWN YOUR COSTS BUT REVENUES ARE THE SAME. SO THEN IF YOU TURN TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT PAGE TEN. WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND KIND OF COMPARISON TO OTHER STATES. WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP KEY FACTORS POLICY OPERATIONAL ARE FACTORS IN MIND AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THESE COMPARISONS. SO AS AN EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA MAY NOT OFFER THE SAME GAMES. AS OTHER STATES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH TO RESPONSIBLE GAMING MAY MEAN THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE AS AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MARKETING PRODUCTS AS OTHER STATES. ARE THAT BEING SAID WE DO HAVE A FEW FACTORS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. SOME TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT'S THE WHERE THESE FACTORS ARE ARE GOING AT. IT THE DATA POLLS FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN DATA. APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OFFER A LOTTERY PRODUCTS. AND SO OUR FIRST METRIC COMPARES SALES TO RETAILERS. AND THE RELATED TO THIS CALIFORNIA AVERAGED ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN SALES PER RETAILER. ABOUT TWENTY TWO STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AVERAGE HIGHER AMOUNTS WITH THE HIGHEST AVERAGING ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER RETAILER. THE SECOND FACTOR LOOKS AT SALES AND POPULATION. CALIFORNIA AVERAGED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER CALIFORNIAN OR NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER CALIFORNIA OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AVERAGE HIGHER SALES. THE THIRD FACTOR THEN LOOKS AT PRIZES AND SALES ABOUT 64% OF CALIFORNIA'S LOTTERY SALES REVENUES ARE GENERATE ARE RETURNED AS PRIZES ABOUT TWELVE STATES RETURNED A GREATER PROPORTION WITH HIGHS REACHING ABOUT 74% THE FOURTH COMPARATOR IS ABOUT HOW FUNDING IS USED IN OTHER STATES SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA AND THERE ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE LOTTERY'S THAT ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING TO EDUCATION PURPOSES. OTHER LOTTERIES ALSO DO FIND VARIOUS OTHER BENEFICIARIES ARE PROGRAMS INCLUDING PROBLEM GAMING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS. THE FINAL FACTOR ON THIS LIST LOOKS AT BENEFICIARIES ARE THEY NOT GOING TO BENEFITS YEARS COMPARED TO SALES AND ON THAT ABOUT 24% OF CALIFORNIA'S LOTTERY SALES REVENUES WENT TO EDUCATION WHICH IS OUR BENEFICIARY. AND ABOUT TWENTY NINE OF THE STATE'S GENERATED. TURNED A GREATER PROPORTION TO THEIR BENEFICIARIES BUT MOST OF THEM ARE WITHIN ABOUT TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS EITHER NOW AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATIONS. IT WILL DO IS JUST WAIT TILL EVERYONE TALKS AND THEN. ASK A QUESTION SO WHAT WE GO DOWN MR JOHNSON. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CHIANG AND GERMAN GRAY IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO TODAY ABOUT. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY. WANT TO START BY PROVIDING YOU A BRIEF INTRODUCTION PRO FOLLOWED BY AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE LOTTERY WORKS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY I'M HONORED TO SERVE THE GOVERNOR THE CAPACITY LOTTERY DIRECTOR I TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY I WILL BE JUDGED ON HOW SUCCESSFUL THE LOTTERY IS IN MAXIMIZING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO EDUCATION WHICH IS IN FACT OUR MISSION. AND MAKING PRUDENT FINANCIAL DECISIONS. IN MY SHORT TIME AT THE LOTTERY JUST A LITTLE UNDER TWO MONTHS. I'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND RANK AND FILE EMPLOYEES ARE THE BACKBONE OF HOW THE LOTTERY DELIVERS ON ITS MISSION. THIS MISSION IS DEAR TO MY HEART. AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AT CAL STATE HAYWARD NOW NOTICE CAL STATE EAST BAY I MENTORED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AT NEWARK MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL. THESE WERE STUDENTS WERE SEEKING HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES BUT FACED A MERRY OUT OF CHALLENGES. IT MAKES ME PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM WHICH I WORKED IN THIRTY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WAS A LOTTERY FUNDED PROGRAM IT WAS FUNDED BY LOTTERY DOLLARS. SO IN A SENSE I FEEL LIKE I'VE COME FULL CIRCLE. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED IN RECENT AUDIT OF THE LOTTERY. PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THESE FINDINGS AND MINISTRY TO FLEE. AND I'VE ALREADY ALREADY BEGUN. TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE INTERNAL CONTROL GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. I WILL CONTINUE MY ASSESSMENT REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT THEN STRENGTH AND ALL AGENCY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWED. AND PRACTICED. THIS WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES TO HELP OUR MISSION. I ALSO WANT TO INCREASE TEAMWORK AND COMMUNICATION TO REINFORCE A CULTURE OF EXCELLENCE AND COLLABORATION AMONGST OUR LOTTERY TEAM MEMBERS. FUTURE GOALS INCLUDE MAINTAINING RESPONSIBLE GROWTH IN SALES AND BRINGING IN ADDITIONAL CONSUMERS. IN DOING SO WE REBUILD THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR AGENCY. HAVING SAID THIS I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE AN OPEN BOOK A FULLY TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE STATE AGENCY. LET ME TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO PROVIDE AN HONOR AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE LOTTERY WORKS. FIRST AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED PROPOSITION THIRTY SEVEN WAS APPROVED BY BALLOT INITIATIVE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE LOTTERY AS AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY AUTHORIZED TO SELL LOTTERY PRODUCTS. THE LOTTERY ACT IS THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK. THAT OUTLINES LOTTERY GAMES IN OVERALL OPERATIONS. THE LOTTERY COMMISSION CAN EXERCISE ALL POWERS NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE PURPOSES SPELLED OUT IN THE LOTTERY ACT. THE LOTTERY'S OPERATIONS ARE SOLELY SUPPORTED BY THE SALE OF LOTTERY TICKETS IT DOESN'T DRAW FROM MORE RECEIVE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. AND FINALLY THE LOTTERY DOES NOT RETAIN OR CARRY OVER ANY SURPLUS FUNDING. THE LOTTERY ACT REQUIRES ALL UNCLAIMED PRIZE MONEY EARNED INTEREST AND ANY SURPLUS FUNDS FROM MONTHS SPENT AND MINISTRY OF EXPENSES TO BE SPENT SHE'S ME TO BE SENT TO PUBLIC EDUCATION EVERY FISCAL YEAR. PROPOSITION THIRTY SEVEN DID NOT PROPOSE THAT THE LOTTERY BE THE SOLE FUNDER FOR THE STATE'S EDUCATION BUDGET. FOR A VOTERS APPROVED THIS PURPOSE AND INTENT AS DESCRIBED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE IN SECTION EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT ZERO POINT ONE. THE LOTTERY QUOTE SHALL NOT BE USED AS SUBSTITUTE FUNDS. BUT RATHER SHALL SUPPLEMENT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY ALLOCATED TO PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. FURTHER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT ZERO POINT FOUR READS QUOTE REVENUES OF THE STATE LOTTERY SHALL BE ALLOCATED SO AS TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING ALLOCATED TO PUBLIC EDUCATION. WE SEE THAT AS OUR PRIMARY MISSION. IN OTHER WORDS THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE LOTTERY IS TO GROW THE AMOUNT OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS TO EDUCATION. I EMPHASIZE THE WORDS MAXIMIZE AND FUNDING BECAUSE THOSE TWO FACTORS HAVE OCCURRED WITH CHANGES THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. THAT PROVIDED PRIZE PAYOUT FLEXIBILITY. AS A RESULT THE LOTTERIES FUNDING DOLLARS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION HAVE GROWN. WE'VE PROVIDED TO HAND OUT TO THE COMMITTEE COUPLE OF PAGES ONE IS A CHARGE AND ONE IS A GRAPH THAT ILLUSTRATE THIS. THESE USE THE SAME FIGURES DESCRIBED BY THE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. THE LOTTERY'S ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC EDUCATION IS DETERMINED BY THE TOTAL SALES REVENUE. LESS PRICE EXPENSES LESS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PLUS INTEREST EARNINGS AND ON QUITE PRICES. NOW REGARDING THE TYPES OF GAMES AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED WE OFFER TWO TYPES PARA MUTUAL GAMES KNOWN AS DRAW AND LOTTO GAMES WERE ALL WINNERS GET AN EQUAL SHARE OF THE COMMON PRICE POOL AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. THE LOTTERY NEWS BEFORE YOU STRUGGLE WITH THE TOTAL PRIZE LIABILITY WILL BE. SECONDLY WE ALSO HAVE INSTANT GAMES KNOWN AS SCRATCHERS THESE HAVE A PREDETERMINED FIXED NUMBER OF PRIZES SO THE LOTTERY KNOWS BEFORE THE GAME STARTS THE TOTAL MAXIMUM PRIZE AMOUNT TO BE AWARDED. IN EACH GAME. REGARDING SALES THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY IS THE SECOND LARGEST LOTTERY IN THE COUNTRY. IN TERMS OF. OVERALL SALES. IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR SALES REVENUE TOTALED SIX POINT NINE SEVEN BILLION. AND WEEP AND THE LOTTERY PROVIDED OVER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. THESE ARE RECORD FIGURES WHICH ARE. AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY ARE REFERENCED IN THE HANDOUTS THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED TO THIS TO THIS BODY. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR GROWTH IN SALES HAS BEEN PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN SCRATCHERS. HOWEVER CERTAIN YEARS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT GAIN DO TWO BILLION DOLLAR MEGA MILLIONS OR POWERBALL JACKPOTS. ESSENTIALLY A KEY PARTOF OUR CELL STRATEGIES WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF LOTTO FEVER BUZZ WHEN THERE'S A LARGE JACKPOT AMOUNT MORE PEOPLE BUY MORE TICKETS AND SO YOU'LL SEE A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN SALES. MORE THAN NINETY FIVE CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR SPNT ON THE LOTTERY GOES BACK TO THE PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF PRIZES RETAILER COMPENSATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FISCAL YEAR THE LOTTERY CREATED NINETY THREE MILLION SHARES AND PROVIDED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHO SELL LOTTERY PRODUCTS. THE LOTTERY EMPLOYEES APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES WHO SUPPORT THE OPERATIONS OF THE LOTTERY AND ITS MISSION. THE LOTTERY IS HEADQUARTERED IN SACRAMENTO AND HAS NINE DISTRICT OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE LOTTERY'S RETAILER NETWORK CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS STATEWIDE. WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT TRADE STYLES INCLUDING SUPERMARKETS CONVENIENCE STORES GAS STATIONS AND OTHER BUSINESSES. RETAILERS ARE **** FOR THE LOTTERIES BRAND. UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND FAIRNESS OF ITS OPERATIONS IN PRODUCTS AND PLAY AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PLAYER EXPERIENCE. THIS IS WHY THE LOTTERIES RETAILER SELECTION CRITERIA IS ROBUST. REGARDING LOTTERY PLAYERS ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS OUR LOTTERY PLAYERS. THAT WAS% ABOUT 63% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ADULTS IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. WE FOUND THE LOTTERY PLAYER DEMOGRAPHICS ARE SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA'S ADULT POPULATION. FOR THE LAST FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN THE PER CAPITA EXPENDITURE AMONGST CALIFORNIA ADULTS ON LOTTERY PRODUCTS WAS A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS OUR FIGURES MATCH WHAT THE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS FOUND. THIS AVERAGES ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS PER WEEK WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE SPENT ON COFFEE. I WANT TO SPEND A FEW MOMENTS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME TALKING ABOUT THE CHANGES MADE BY AB ONE FORTY TO ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO THIS BILL BY. THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HI ARCHIE WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWED THE LOTTERY COMMISSION TO CHANGE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE SO AS TO INCREASE PRICES AND INCREASED SALES. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF THAT BILL IN TWO THOUSAND TEN PRICES WERE FIXED AT 50% OF REVENUES. AT THE TIME CALIFORNIA WAS AMONG A SMALL NUMBER OF STATES WHOSE PRIZE EXPENSES WERE RESTRICTED IN THIS MANNER. ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION. AVERAGED OVER ONE POINT ZERO EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE EIGHT YEARS PRIOR TO THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE FORTY TWO. WHAT THAT BILL ACTUALLY DID WERE THREE MAIN THINGS. IT REDUCE THE LOTTERIES ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CAP FROM THE 50% CAP ON PRICES. AND FINALLY TO REMOVE THE SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OFF ALLOCATED TO PUBLIC EDUCATION. THE AMENDED LANGUAGE A LOTTERY ACT IN STATE SPECIFIED THAT NOT LESS THAN REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF STATE LOTTERY TICKETS OR SHARE SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF PRIZES AND NET REVENUES TO. BENEFIT PUBLIC EDUCATION. AB ONE FORTY TO ENABLE THE LOTTERY TO INCREASE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC EDUCATION AND GROW SALES. BY PROVIDING HIGHER PRICES TO ATTRACT PLAYERS. WITH THE PRICE FLEXIBILITY GRANTED BY THIS BILL THE LOTTERIES ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE PLAYERS TO BUY MORE TICKETS WHICH INCREASES SALES AND RESULT IN INCREASED DOLLARS TO EDUCATION. SCHOOLS ARE GETTING MORE MONEY EVERY YEAR BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE FORTY TWO HAS GROWN THE LOTTERY'S CONTRIBUTION THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS BY MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINE TWO THOUSAND TEN. THIS REPRESENTS A BOOST OF ABOUT 56% IN EIGHT YEARS. WE BELIEVE IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE TWO THREE FORMULA MORE PRIZES MORE SALES MEANS MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS. I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY IF I MAY ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE LOTTERY. ABOUT FOR THIS PURPOSE AND IS BROKEN DOWN IN THREE WAYS. 7% IS FOR RETAILER COMPENSATION. THIS REPRESENTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID TO THE LOTTERY RETAILERS FOR SELLING LOTTERY PRODUCTS AND CASH AND PRIZES UNDER FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS. THIS COST DIRECTLY CORRELATES WITH LOTTERY SALES. ABOUT 2% OF THAT PORTION IS FOR GAMING COSTS THIS REPRESENTS THE COST TO PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE LOTTERY SCRATCHERS TICKETS TO ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LOTTERY RETAILERS IT ALSO INCLUDES CONTRACT COSTS FOR THE LOTTERIES GAMING SYSTEM PROVIDER. IGT THIS ALSO CORRELATES WITH LOTTERY SALES. THE REMAINING 4% IS FOR OPERATIONAL EXPENSES THESE ARE COMPRISED OF THE TYPICAL OVERHEAD EXPENSES NEEDED TO RUN A DEPARTMENT AND ARE GENERALLY INDEPENDENT OF SALES. I WANNA KNOW THAT THE LOTTERY TYPICALLY ONLY SPENDS AROUND 3% OF ANNUAL SALES REVENUE FOR OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ALONE THE LOTTERY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION MORE TO EDUCATION BY MAINTAINING OUR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. BELOW THE 13% CAP. FINALLY I WANT TO NOTE. I'M IN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ON AT SET HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED A LOT. RECENTLY IN THE PRESS AND OTHER PLACES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LOTTERY ACT GOVERNMENT CODE SPECIFICALLY EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT ZERO POINT FOUR SIX POINT SIX AUTHORIZES THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL AUDITS OF ALL ACCOUNTS. AND TRANSACTIONS AS IT DEEMS NECESSARY. THIS INCLUDES EXAMINATION OF ANY ALL RECORDS OF THE COMMISSION LOTTERY CONTRACTORS AND LOTTERY GAME RETAILERS. LOTTERY AUDIT AND FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE MANDATED BY LAW OR REGULATION AND OTHERS ARE CONDUCTED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. LOTTERY AUDITS OCCUR EVERY MONTH OF THE YEAR. OVER THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDING IN THE FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE LOTTERY HAS UNDERGONE FIFTY TWO AUDITS OR ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT SEVENTEEN ON ITS PER YEAR. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS OF THE LOTTERY PROVIDE ASSURANCES TO THE COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC THE GAMING OPERATIONS ARE LEGAL AND SECURE. AND THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RELEVANT STATUTES REGULATIONS AND OTHER APPLICABLES STANDARDS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BOTH OUR MISSION OF PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO EDUCATION AND CONTINUING A CULTURE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT ALL AGENCIES MUST OBSERVE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WE CAN GO TO MR FITZ PATRICK NOW WITH FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON JUMPED PATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE STATUTORY SUPREME WORK FOR THE LOTTERY COMMISSION SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIES THE RULE THAT FINANCE TYPICALLY PAY PLAYS FOR AN ENTITY. BUT WE HAVE A COUPLE REPRESENTATIVES HERE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR AREA. THANK YOU ARE JUST GOING TO GO NOW TO THE- PANELS IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS. I'M SORRY MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS KIND OF RELATING TO THE CORE TOPIC THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS THAT WHEN THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA APPROVED THE CREATION OF A STATE LOTTERY IT WAS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM THE LOTTERY WOULD GO TO EDUCATION AND I THINK WE'RE ALL. INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WERE FOR FILLING THAT PROMISE AND I'M SURE THAT YOU ARE TO. THE THING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO CONSTRUED TO ME IS WHAT THE LA RAISED IN THEIR ANALYSIS WHICH IS THAT. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN. REVENUE FROM THE LOTTERY MORE THAN DOUBLE. AND YET THE REVENUE THAT WE ARE CONTRIBUTING TO EDUCATION IS A PORTION OF LOTTERY SALES HAS DECLINED FROM 34% TO LESS THAN FOR YOUR QUESTION. IT'S A BIT OF A. A TRICKY PICTURE WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUST THE PERCENTAGES AND WHAT WE FOUND HELPFUL IN THIS ANALYSIS OR IS TO LOOK AT THE ABSOLUTE DOLLARS ARE DRIVEN TO EDUCATION BECAUSE OUR MISSION AS LAID OUT IN STATUTE IS TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. THE CHANGES MADE LEGISLATURE TEN YEARS AGO IN AB ONE FORTY TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY TO INCREASE THE PRIZE. AND THERE'S A TIGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICES AND SALES. SO IN EFFECT BY MAKING MORE ATTRACTIVE PRIZES. THE LOTTERY'S BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THE WHOLE PIE. AND BY DOING SO MORE DOLLARS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN EDUCATION OKAY I WAS INTERESTED THAT PARTY OR TESTIMONY BECAUSE I HEARD YOU SAY THAT. ABSENT THE DROPPING OF THAT CAPTAIN AB ONE FORTY TWO YOU BELIEVE THAT OVERALL LOTTERY REVENUE WILL BE LOWER BUT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS SAME QUESTION A DIFFERENT WAY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS OF PHYSICAL DOLLARS THAT WE HAND OVER TO EDUCATION. ARE HIGHER NOW THAN IF WE HAD RETAINED THAT 34% MINIMUM IN AB ONE FORTY TWO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES. MOST OF THE SALES ARE DRIVEN BY SCRATCHERS AND WE WILL OFFER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SCRATCHER PRODUCTS AND PRICE LEVELS BUT IN ADDITION AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY EARLIER SIR. WE'VE SEEN THAT IN WHAT WE CALL THE PARA MUTUAL GAMES THE DRAW GAMES MAKE UP MEGA MILLIONS OR POWERBALL THAT WHEN THERE ARE. JACKPOTS THAT ARE VERY LARGE WHICH WE CAN'T NECESSARILY PREDICT THAN THAT ATTRACTS MORE PLAYERS IN THAT DRIVE SALES SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE FROM YEAR TO YEAR INDIVIDUAL VARIATION TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE WILL HAVE A JACKPOT OF SAY A BILLION DOLLARS PEOPLE ARE EXCITED BY THAT AND THEY WANT TO PLAY WE HAVE THUS MORE SALES. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE FLEXIBILITY THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED TEN YEARS AGO IS. OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE PRIZES ESPECIALLY SCRATCHERS. AND THAT'LL LABELS US TO HAVE MORE SALES AND MORE REVENUE. OKAY WELL I CONSIDER ME EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL ON THAT CLAIM AND IF YOU HAVE SOME SOME DATA THAT BACKS IT UP I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN READING IT. I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE THAT HAVING A LARGER. GRAND PRIZE. IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN MARKET AROUND IT THAT WILL DRIVE SALES REVENUE TO THE LOTTERY BUT- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE OF THE REVENUE THAT GOES TO THE PRIZE POOL. I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE PLAYING LOTTERY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MATH BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK HONESTLY IF THAT'S WHAT WAS DRIVING THEIR PURCHASE DECISION THEY WOULDN'T BE PLAYING THE LOTTERY. SO I QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULDN'T BE BETTER OFF FROM AN EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT REINSTITUTING THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. A CAP THAT YOU BE. THE ONE. FORTY ONE FORTY TWO WAS I WAS JUST INSTITUTED AN I. ONE LAST QUESTION AND IT'S IT GOES TO ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN TRENDING RECENTLY AND WITHIN THE LOTTERY AND THAT'S THAT IF YOU LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL LOTTERY REVENUE ONE WOULD EXPECT OUT AS REVENUE ROSE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WILL ALSO GROW BUT AS A PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL SALES IT WILL DECLINE BECAUSE YOU'RE AMORTIZING YOUR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. A LARGE NUMBER OF TICKETS SOLD BUT THAT IN FACT IS NOT WHAT BEEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED A WITH JENNER'S IN FACT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE BEEN VERY STEADY AT AROUND 12% OF. THE NEW AND I JUST WONDERED WHY THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD EXPECT. WELL YOU'RE RIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY FLAT AROUND 12% AS YOU INDICATE. THOSE COSTS AS I INDICATED IN MY TESTIMONY ARE DIVIDED AMONGST WHAT WE PAY OUR TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS WHAT WE PAY OUR VENDORS AND ALSO OVERHEAD AND AS I INDICATED ALSO DURING MY TESTIMONY ARE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT OF ACTUALLY BEEN BELOW WHAT'S BEEN THAT THE EFFECTIVE CAP. AND WE SAID THE DIFFERENCE BACK TO SCHOOLS IN. IN TERMS OF EDUCATION FUNDING I WOULD SAY THAT. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE DATA REFLECTS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO PAY THE RETAILERS WE HAVE TO BE THE VENDORS AND- TO A LARGE DEGREE THAT'S BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT WE SELL. SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE'S ALSO A LARGE NO. EXPENSES THAT ARE DRIVEN BY THE VOLUME OF SALES. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I WOULD EXPECT TO DECLINE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT THE CLIENT AND- YOU KNOW AS A LEGISLATOR WHEN YOU SAY. WHAT WE'RE STILL UNDER THE CAP THAT MEANS TO ME WILL ME WE LOOK AT LOWERING THE CAP BECAUSE YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE SEVEN CENTER POSITION NEEDS THAT TO OCCUR THERE. BUT I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM HERE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- WE FOR. OUR PROBLEM TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WE MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS WE'RE GETTING TO EDUCATION I JUST HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS. THAT THERE ISN'T A BETTER WAY OF GOING ABOUT THIS. MCCARTY. THANK YOU I JUST SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FROM MISTER OBERNOLTE BUT FIRST WANT TO CONGRATULATE THAT MISTER JOHNSON ON THE APPOINTMENT OF RUNNING THE LOTTERY I KNOW YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A PRIOR LA REPRESENTATIVE KEEP CHIEF COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THE GEO COMMITTEES AND THEN AMONG RECENTLY LEADING GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. FOR A LARGE TRIBE CALIFORNIA WILL SERVE YOU WELL. TO HELP OUR LOTTERY AND THINK FRANKLY GET TO THE ISSUE THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT IT IF ALL OF US LEGISLATORS COULD GET. TEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY CONSTITUENT THAT SAID HEY WHY YOU WANT TO TAX MORE WHAT ABOUT THAT LOTTERY. WE WOULD HAVE A LOT OF MONEY FOR OUR OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION AND- YOU KNOW. A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLYDO THINK THAT. INCLUDING VERY WELL VERY. EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS. THAT THAT SEE THE SALES IN THE REVENUES AND I WANTED TO GET TO WHAT WITH MISTER ROBLES WAS ASKING BUT ALSO ASK ABOUT. OTHER STATES AND PRACTICES BECAUSE- WE'VE SEEN THAT THE THAT THE GROWTH SO. THE ACTUAL MONEY. I THINK IT'S A KIND OF SIMPLE AND AWAY DON'T NINE THE LA A HAND OUT HERE. TRANSFER STATE EDUCATION WAS A LITTLE OVER. AND NOW IT'S ONE POINT SIX OH ROUGHLY 60% GROWTH THERE BUT THE TOTAL LOTTERY SALES. AS OUR BUDGET VICE CHILDREN HE STATED HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED. AND SO YOU WOULD THINK WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE UPSIDE THERE SO ON SOME OF THESE OTHER. STATES THAT HAVE SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN LOTTERY PROGRAMS THE MONEY'S GOOD EDUCATION. ANY LESSONS THAT AND I'M SORRY MISSUS AND THE EARLIER CONVERSATION. ANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED THAT FROM THE LA L. WERE FROM LOTTERY. AS FAR AS WHAT WE COULD DO TO. SQUEEZE MORE RESOURCES TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHICH ARE STRUGGLING AS WE KNOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES TODAY. THE CHALLENGE OF TELLING THE LOTTERY STORIES BEEN THERE FROM THE FROM THE INCEPTION OUR SCHOOLS WHEN TO IS A COMMON SLOGAN THAT MANY PEOPLE REMEMBER FROM. THE CAMPAIGN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR TO ESTABLISH THE LOTTERY ACT. AND I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES EXPLAINING THE FULL PICTURE OF EDUCATION FUNDING. I THINK A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COULD BENEFIT FROM KNOWING MORE ABOUT WERE THE STATE'S DOLLARS GO WHERE THEY COME FROM. THE LOTTERY TICKETS OR FROM TAXES WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION FUNDING AS YOU KNOW SIR THERE ARE MANY TENS OF BILLIONS DOLLARS THAT SUPPORT ALL THE DIFFERENT EDUCATION SEGMENTS. AND AS THE ELLIE EXPLAINED. LOTTERY FUNDING AMOUNTS DEPENDING ON WHICH SIGNAL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN ONE AND A HALF TO TWO PERCENT. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE DEPENDING. WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT LOTTERY DOLLAR SUPPORT EDUCATION EVERYWHERE THERE ARE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. FROM K. FOURTEEN TO. UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS EVEN TO STUDENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. IT DOES AVERAGE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A FRACTION OF THE FUNDING THAT SCHOOLS GET FROM THE STATE. WHAT WE WANT TO DO AS I INDICATED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS IN TERMS OF PROGRAMS THAT CAN ACTUALLY BENEFIT STUDENTS IS HIGHLIGHT THOSE PROGRAMS. WE'RE NOT HERE. DOLLARS TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS THAT STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM. AND WE HAVE WORK TO DO TO TELL THAT STORY AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE VISION THAT I HAVE GOING FORWARD IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIA EXCUSE ME EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS MORE ABOUT WHAT LOTTERY DOLLARS ARE DOING IN THEIR SCHOOLS. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME GOOD STORIES OUT THERE AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF ON MYSELF. YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT AND A VERY GOOD QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ONE SIR REGARDING WHAT HAPPENS OTHER STATES. WE KNOW THAT OTHER STATES. SOME OTHER STATES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME CAP ON PRICES THAT CALIFORNIA HAD WON THE LOTTERY ACT WAS INSTITUTED THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT'S THE THIRTY FOUR PERCENT. OF THE 50% FIFTY PERCENT. THE 50% CAP ON PRICES WAS PARTY REGIONAL WATER REACT. AND CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF A SMALL NUMBER STATES IT HAD SUCH CAP OTHER STATES DID NOT HAVE THAT CAP. ON PRICES. AND SO. OUR EXPERIENCE THE TEN YEARS OF DATA WE HAVE SINCE AB ONE FORTY TWO WAS PASSED HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU. HAVE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY. TO MAKE THE PRICES MORE ATTRACTIVE YOU CAN REALLY DRIVE SALES. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT RESULT IN INCREASED DOLLARS CHANGE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTERS ARE. BY A STATUE TO THE LEGISLATURE. IT WILL BE THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR CAN BE DONE BY THE VOTERS IT HAS TO FURTHER ACCORDING TO THE LOTTERY ACCESS TO FOR THE PURPOSES. OF THE LOTTERY MAXIMIZING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE SO THOSE I DON'T DO AS THE ELLIE ON A SECOND SO THE PRICES SO. IN PLAIN ENGLISH TO FOLLOW UP ON ON MISTER OBERNOLTE. YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE THAT THE PLAYER. IS MAKING A DECISION HEY I'M GONNA BUY EXTRA TICKET CITY XML SCRATCHER OR DO THE- POWER WHATEVER YOU CALL THE BALL NUMBERS. BECAUSE THERE OUGHT. THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE BETTER CHANCE OF WINNING BUT- THE ODDS ARE STILL. STACKED AGAINST YOU THAT. IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE TO OUR- OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM ARE THOSE PLAYERS REALLY. GOING TO. NOT. THEY PARTICIPATE. IN THE EFFORT. WILL FUNDAMENTALLY SIR WERE A SALES ORGANIZATION AND THE CHALLENGE IS ALWAYS BEEN HOW DO YOU FIND A WAY TO. IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. DRIVE SALES. AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN THE TRICK IN THE CHALLENGE WE COME UP WITH. INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WITH PRODUCTS USING A LICENSING FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS MONOPOLY WHICH IS VERY POPULAR. WE DO OTHER THINGS TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE BUT THERE'S- A RESEARCH AND PLANNING ELEMENT THAT GOES INTO ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THOSE ARE REALLY MAKING MONEY WHETHER THOSE ARE EFFECTIVE OR NOT. THE THINGS THAT DON'T WORK WE RETIRE AND WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO PACKAGE OUR PRODUCTS IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT. PEOPLE ARE INCENTIVIZED TO PLAY. IT'S ENTERTAINMENT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE OTHER GAMING INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. THE POINT IS TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO USE. OF THEIR MONEY IN WAYS THAT THEY FIND INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING. AND IN OUR CASE IN THE STATE LOTTERIES CASE WERE ABLE TO. USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS TO BENEFIT THE KIDS IN SCHOOLS AND OTHER STUDENTS. AND THEN THE LA OF ANY INSIGHT FROM OTHER STATES OTHER COMMUNITIES WE HAVEN'T DONE A ROBUST ANALYSIS COMPARING CALIFORNIA TO OTHER STATES I THINK ON THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE DO A LAY OUT SOME COMPARATORS AND IN TERMS OF SOME OBSERVATIONS. THAT WE OWE IT. OF A COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DID TALK ABOUT IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP INTO KEEPING IN MIND TO SOME OF THESE OTHER FACTORS. IN THESE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK THE LOTTERY IS CLEARLY THINKING ABOUT AS THEY LOOK AT NEW PRODUCTS OR HOW THEY OFFER PRODUCTS. AND SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THERE ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE INHERENT TO CALIFORNIA. THAT MAY NOT BE AS A LARGE OF AN ISSUE FOR OTHER STATES SO FOR EXAMPLE IT DOES ALSO KICK BACK TO GENERALLY HOW GAMING. IS STRUCTURED IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME OTHER LOTTERIES TURN AHLERS THAT MIGHT OFFER GAMES THAT CAN KIND OF TOUCH ON THE CASINO SIDE ESSENTIALLY CASINOS ARE SOMETIMES INVOLVED IN THAT AND SO THAT ARE READY PROVIDES A DIFFERENT FROM WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED. A LEGISLATURE WAITED ON EXTRA. THE OTHER ISSUE. IS A MAJOR NINE CALIFORNIA AND THE WATER CAN SPEAK MORE TO IT. IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A PRIORITY ON RESPONSIBLE GAMING. AND SO A FEW YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY WAS ONE OF THE FEW LOTTERIES IF NOT THE ONLY LOTTERY IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HIT LEVEL FOUR CERTIFICATION. FOR RESPONSIBLE GAMING THERE CERTAINLY MORE QUICK TO TALK ABOUT THAT IN MORE DEPTH BUT THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WOULD IMPACTS. COMPARATORS TO OTHER STATES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. I'VE GOT SEVERAL. QUESTIONS GOV LISTING TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY. I WANT TO BEGIN HE IS SOMEONE ADDRESSING MY COLLEGE CONCERNS. ABOUT TO HEAD OUT AND THE AND THE PERCENTAGES INTO WHICH IS I DON'T THINK I SHARE THE SKEPTICISM THAT I HEAR FROM SOME MIGHT BUDGET COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES BUT I SU MY BUDGET COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES HAVEN'T SPENT AS MUCH TIME AROUND THE GAMING INDUSTRY HAS AS THOSE OF US WHO SIT ON GEO COMMITTEE AND CERTAINLY THE NOTION OF OPTIMAL TAKE OUT OF THE CHURN ARE PRETTY. YOU KNOW WIDELY ACCEPTED THE FINANCIAL STRATEGIES IN THE GAMING WORLD SO THAT YOU'RE SIX IT'S WELL WITH ME WHAT DOESN'T OR WHERE I TEND TO GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE WITH MR OBERNOLTE IS. ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THOUGH. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT. THE APPROACH TAKEN HASHING BILL AND THE REDUCTION OF MISSION EXPENSES AND THE SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN PRICES WOULD WORK AGAIN IF WE WENT FROM YOU KNOW. TWELVE TO TEN. ANOTHER SOME POINT. WHERE YOUR PRIOR WILLING TOO MUCH ON THE BALL. WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. THE BREAKDOWN AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER I JUST WANT TO RUN THROUGH IT AGAIN JUST TO PROVIDE A FRIENDLY REFRESH. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER OF COMPENSATION AGO STORE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE STATE. ABOUT 2% FOR GAMING COSTS THOSE ARE. TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE THE SCRATCHERS TICKETS. AND ALSO THE CONCEPT WE PROVIDE THAT ARE FROM OUR GAMING SYSTEM PROVIDER IGT. MEETING REMAINING 4% FOR OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. AND TYPICALLY WE SPEND AROUND 3% OF THAT 4% OR ABOUT THROUGH 75% THAT WE SPEND WE TRY TO HOLD BACK AS MUCH AS WE CAN WE SENT THE DIFFERENCE TO SCHOOLS. SO I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY IN THIS FORM YOU KNOW WHERE CAN WE CUT FURTHER I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY DECISION THAT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND THE LOTTERY COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. BUT I WOULD SAY BASED ON MY SLIGHTLY LESS THAN TWO MONTHS EXPERIENCE STUDYING THIS INFORMATION AND TALKING TO THE STAFF THAT THEY'RE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO BE EFFICIENT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK FIND WAYS WE CAN INSTITUTE POLICY PROCEDURES ARE EVEN BETTER AT THAT. WHAT'S PROBABLY IMPORTANT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS. FOR THAT A 1% REDUCTION. IN OVERALL THE MEASURE OF COSTS WOULD ACTUALLY BE A 25% REDUCTION. IN THAT CONTROLLABLE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS SO I MEAN THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO WAY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU TOUCHED ON THE COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP OUR COLLEGE UNDERSTAND. WHO IS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ON THE EXPENDITURES RIGHT HOW DO WE ARRIVE AT I SAW HERE TWO POINT TWELVE A SATYR WHO SETS THOSE PERCENTAGES AND AN APPROPRIATE START THAT MONEY. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SHERMAN I'M GONNA START THE ANSWER I'M GONNA ASK OUR W. DIRECTOR FINANCE NICK YOU CAN TO FILL IN SOME OF THE MORE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. ESSENTIALLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE LOTTERY GENERATES AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN. AND THEN QUARTERLY REPORTS THAT FUND OF THE IN THOSE PROCEEDS DELIVERS THAT MONEY TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THAT MONIES DISTRIBUTED VIA FORMULA DEPENDING ON THE SEGMENT THAT IT GOES TO TYPICALLY BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT. BUT THERE ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT I'M ASKING THE FOLKS HERE TO HELP PROVIDE. NICK YOU CAN THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY SO AS DIRECTOR JOHNSON I INDICATED THE LOTTERY. RUNS FINANCIALS QUARTERLY THAT THE CONTROLLER COMES AND AUDITS THE FINANCIALS IT'S A SIMPLE FORMULA REVENUE MINUS THE PRICE EXPENSE MINUS THE MEASURE EXPENSES PLUS THE UNCLAIMED PRIZES IN INTEREST EARNINGS THE THOSE GETS SENT IT BY CONTROLLER I'LL THEIR TRANSFERRED TO THE EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. AT THE EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES THEN DECIDE HOW THEY THE MONEY GETS FURTHER ALLOCATED SO FOR EXAMPLE THE AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE DETERMINATION ON WHICH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS WITHIN THEIR DISTRICTS GET THE FUNDING I SAW THOSE PERCENTAGES ARE THEY'RE NOT FIXED PERCENTAGE IT'S IT IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. IN ALL THOSE ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATUTES WHICH WOULD SUGGEST. TO ME THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO SAY. THE YOU KNOW SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU RECEIVED. SHOULD BE SPENT IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF THE CSU UC OR ETCETERA THAT THAT WOULD BE ABLE WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. ALTHOUGH IT TIES BACK TO IT HE DID THERE HAS TO BE A DEMONSTRATION THAT IT FURTHERS THE PURPOSES ACT SO AS LONG AS IT'S WITHIN THE CONFINES OF YOU'LL SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND- YOU KNOW IT'S AND IT'S NOT MEANT TO REPLACE ANY FUNDING THAT THE STATE PROVIDES. ELSEWHERE AND THAT'S CORRECT. RIGHT NOT A NOT NOT DISCUSSION OF. SWAPPING OUT THE MONEY TO DISCUSSION OF WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY ON. WHICH WOULD BE. AT LEAST AT FIRST BLUSH MANY THE RUSSELL LEDGE COUNCIL I GUESS BUT. AND FURTHERANCE LET ME. ON THAT SUBJECT GET INTO ONE MORE IN THE ORIGINAL INITIATIVE. THE PRICES ARE NOT SUBJECTED COVERING TAXES. THERE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL TAXES NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A POLICY THAT'S CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IT DOES. BEG THE QUESTION. DEAR WHY AND IT SHOULD THAT CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE BOX. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO GERMAN THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK INTO FURTHER AND FIND IF THERE'S ANY IN IN FOR INFORMATION REVEALED IN A SURVEY OF STATES AS TWO. TRENDS OR REASONS FOR THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THE RICH OWNERSHIP WAS WRITTEN IN THAT MATTER. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT OFF FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT WHAT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION OR SOMETHIN PRIZES THIS PAST YEARS ARE ABOUT RIGHT. AND. FOUR FOUR SEVEN SIX THAT COULD JUST OFF TOP MY HEAD GENERATE ANYWHERE FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE TAX REVENUE. SO THAT'S SIGNIFICANT INSIDE LIKE TO CUT A STEP FURTHER WITH YOU AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE GAMES YOU CAN OFFER NO YOU. MADE SOME REFERENCE REALLY SALLY MADE SOME REFERENCE TO WHAT. THE UNIQUENESS OF CALIFORNIA. GAMING LAW WHAT THE LOTTERY IS ALLOWED OR NOT ALLOWED TO DO WHAT'S DONE OTHER STATES. WHAT GAMES CAN YOU OFFER WHAT GAMES CAN'T SHUT OFF. THE TWO GAMES UNDER THAT WE OFFER AS I DESCRIBED EARLIER OUR PARA MUTUAL GAMES THE LOTTO GAMES AND SCRATCHERS THOSE THE TWO GAMES AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH I'D I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS ON OTHER TYPES OF GAMES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO RESEARCH FURTHER. AND ON THAT NOTE IF IN FACT THE VOTERS IN THIS STATE SOFFIT TO LEGALIZE SPORTS WAGERING DO YOU THINK THE STATE LOTTERY COULD ADMINISTER SPORTS WAGERING. SO THE QUESTION IS COULD THE LOTTERY ADMINISTER SPORTS GAMING IS THAT CORRECT SIR. THAT'S THE QUESTION. WELL AGAIN IN MY LESS THAN TWO MONTHS ON THE JOB I HAVE TO START WITH I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES THERE I THINK THAT WE CAN GENERALLY HAVE A MANDATE TO INCREASE SALES IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY FOR THE PLAYERS OF THE STATE LOTTERY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SPORTS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY WE'D WANT TO INVESTIGATE THAT AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY BUT I COULDN'T TODAY IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE MINISTER WE HAVE IN ORDER FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE FOLKS ARE HEADQUARTERED HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE HAVE ABOUT NINE OR TEN DISTRICT OFFICES AROUND THE STATE AND A COUPLE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHERE OPERATE IN A IN A PRETTY LEAN MANNER ALREADY AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE GUIDANCE WE HAVE FROM OUR LEADERSHIP THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT BUT RIGHT NOW I'M- I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS AND- MISS QUIRK SILVA. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION UP I COME OUT OF EDUCATION SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR I WAS JUST STARTING MY TEACHING CAREER AND I REMEMBER QUITE A BIT OF. INFORMATION OUT THERE NOT ONLY TO THE PUBLIC BUT TO EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS ABOUT HOW THE LOTTERY WAS GOING TO. REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR SCHOOLS AND REALLY A HUGE CAMPAIGN AND IT WAS VOTED IN. MY CONCERN IS THAT YEARS LATER MANY MANY YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW GENERATION THAT MAY BE BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS PARTICIPATING BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE- ORIGINALS OF THE US. AND EVEN NOW NOW IS MY CALL THE WAS SAYING I OFTEN DO GET PEOPLE SAY HEY WHATEVER HAPPENED OF THAT LOTTERY MONEY. AND IT ISN'T THE IDEA THAT IT'S NOT GOING WHERE IT WAS STATED TO GO IT'S THAT THE SCHOOLS IN FACT I THINK CAB BECOME VERY COMPLACENT IN THE SENSE OF WELL THAT'S JUST THIS MONEY WE GET AND- BUT IN THE EARLY DAYS IT WAS VERY MUCH SPECIFIED. BY THE BOARDS TO NOT ONLY THE PARENTS BUT ALSO TO THE EDUCATORS OF IT WHAT EXACTLY THIS MONEY WAS BEING USED FOR I KNOW THAT YOU CAN GO ON TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S WEBSITE AND SEE OR THE REQUIRED I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED. BUT THAT YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED SO I GUESS TWO OR THREE THINGS ONE IS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LIKE YOU SAY TELL A NEW STORY TO. YOU KNOW GIVE EXAMPLES. READY TO RESTART THAT NARRATIVE OF WHY WE ORIGINATED THAT. BUT THEN SECONDLY. IS THERE I THINK SOMEBODY JUST ASK DOES IT GO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ALLOCATES A DRUG SO WE COULD HAVE SCHOOLS RECEIVING SOME AND OTHERS NOT RECEIVING ANY. I THINK THAT THAT THAT WOULD IS A BIG SURPRISE FOR ME SITTING HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IN FACT EVERY SCHOOL GOT SOMETHING SO I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE ANOTHER CONVERSATION BECAUSE. YOU KNOW NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME SOME MAY NEED MORE OF X. THAN OTHERS BUT- THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MANY PEOPLE AT THAT TIME IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR VOTED FOR THIS UNDER THE- SUPPORT OF EDUCATION ANDTHIRTY YEARS LATER ALMOST OR TWENTY FIVE. I THINK THAT THE RE STATING THAT AND REALLY BRINGING THE SCHOOLS BACK INTO THE DISCUSSION AND STARTED TO LOOK FOR WAYS THAT THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING IS BECAUSE I DO SO I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE TEACHER SALARIES OF THEIR- SO. I THINK THERE'S SOME WORK WE COULD DO NOW TO UPDATE WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE STRONGLY AGREE WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO RENEW AN UPDATE THE STORY ABOUT THE LOTTERY WHAT THE LOTTERY DOES AND THE MONEY THAT GOES TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IN A SENSE YOU KNOW IT IT'S A STORY OF LOCAL CONTROL WE KNOW THAT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION MAKE THOSE SPENDING THIS MAKE THOSE SPENDING DECISIONS. AND YOU KNOW. THAT SOMETHING AS YOU DESCRIBED PEOPLE WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF RIGHT AFTER THE LOTTERY WAS WAS CREATED. SO FROM WHERE WE SAID WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE STORIES THAT WE CAN LEARN ABOUT AND THAT WE KNOW ABOUT ABOUT HOW LOTTERY MONIES USED. TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND IN GOOD WAYS AND WE'RE GONNA DO SOME WORK ON THAT. MR SALAS THANK YOU THANK HER PRESENTATION YOU HEARD SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ACTUALLY TOUCHING ON THIS TO IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND WHAT NOT AND I KNOW THE DIRECTOR RESIGNED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE GOT A TEAM GOING BUT I DID HEAR WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING TO UPDATE YOU KNOW THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES KIND OF WHAT. WE HAD AN AUDIT AND THE OTHER HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND- YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT THE BAD HEADLINES OF. THAT HAVE OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN TERMS OF EXPENSES AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED AT THE LOTTERY WHICH THEN LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF. SHOULD WE PUT THE CAP BACK IN AND SHOULD THERE BE. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE GOING BACK TO SCHOOLS. CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON. THE AUDIT WHERE YOU GUYS ARE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE. CONTROL MECHANISMS I'D APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECENT THAT. THE MONEY TO ADMINISTER THE LOTTERY IS DONE SO IN A RESPONSIBLE AND PROFESSIONAL WAY. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE VERY PROBLEMATIC INCIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WERE TAKING ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS. AS I INDICATED IN MY TESTIMONY PREVIOUSLY. WERE ON AVERAGE SUBJECT TO ABOUT SEVENTEEN ON A TWO YEAR. THE STATE CONTROLS OFF OFFICE ACTUALLY HAS AN OFFICE IN OUR BUILDING YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THEY CONDUCT THEIR- REGULAR AUDITS. AND WE ACTUALLY PER THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. HAVE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF. BEING SUBJECTED TO AN AUDIT BY THE BUREAU STATE LAWS BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT AGENCY AND- PROVIDED WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY HAVE REQUESTED SO THEY CAN SEE HOW WE DO OUR BUSINESS. TO ADDRESS THE FIRST POINT YOU RAISE I THINK THAT NEW IN MY TEN YEAR WHAT ARE THE THINGS I'M TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. CONSISTENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING LOTTERY PRACTICES. A LOT OF THE LOTTERIES BUSINESSES FUNCTIONS ACTIVITIES ARE BEING DONE IN THE RIGHT WAY. BUT I'VE ASKED FOLKS I THAT'S MY TEAM TO REVIEW AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRACTICES ARE CURRENT. THAT PEOPLE ARE TRAINED ON THEM SO THAT THEY'RE FULLY JUSTIFIED IN THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT. WE THINK THAT THE CONTROLS COULD BE BETTER AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. GOT IT SEE. I KNOW THERE'S A CHECK IN WITH THE AUDIT. RIGHT FOR EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED SO ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN SEE IN YOUR AGENDA ITEMS. AT THE COMMISSION MEETINGS OR WE GET THAT I KNOW YOU SAID THE CONTROLLER AUDITS AND THE CONTROLLERS THERE BUT I MEAN HONESTLY THE CONTROLLER WAS THERE BEFORE AND THEN WE HAD ALL THESE BAD HEADLINES AND- WE HAVE THE INCIDENTS AS WE HAVE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. ADMINISTRATIVELY YOU KNOW ONE ARE YOU COMMITTED TO ALL OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING THEM AND NOT JUST DISCUSSING THEM BUT SEEING AN ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IN PLACE CAN THE LEGISLATURE EXPECT TO SEE THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. OR. THERE SUIT YOU KNOW. SOON THEREAFTER. AND THEN I THINK THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AS WELL FOR WHAT WE DO POLICY WISE PROBABLY NEXT YEAR. WELL I CAN START THE RESPONSE TO QUESTION BY EXPLAINING THAT WE DO HAVE. AN ENGAGEMENT WITH EACH OF THE AUDITOR'S THAT COMES THROUGH ALL THAT INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND WE DO GO THROUGH THE FINDINGS WE DISCUSS THE FINDINGS WITH THEM. AND WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THEIR FINDINGS IN THERE SOME BACK AND FORTH THEY EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS OUR SUCCESS IN ADDRESSING YOUR FINDINGS AND- WE YOU KNOW WE GO THROUGH THIS WITH EACH OF THE ENTITIES THAT REVIEWS. ARE ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS AND SOLVE THAT IS SUBJECT TO PUBLIC DISCO DISCLOSURE. THESE ARE THE KIND OF WANT TO. SO THE IN THE AUDIT REPORT THAT THE CONTROLLERS LEAST IN APRIL THEY COMMITTED TO RETURNING IN OCTOBER TWO. YOU SEE THAT WERE FOLLOWING UP ON THE ITEMS THAT WE SAID WE WOULD. SO WE WOULD EXPECT THE CONTROLLER TO RELEASE ANOTHER DOCUMENT OUTLINING OUR SUCCESSES IN IN IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES. ALL RIGHT AND THEN I JUST WANT TO ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK. SOMEBODY BROUGHT IT UP EARLIER THE REASON WHY MORE MONEY IS CONTACT EDUCATION IS. WOULD YOU SAY IT'S BECAUSE WE REMOVE THE PERCENTAGE REQUIRED TO GO TO EDUCATION. WITH THE HI ASHLEY BILL I THINK IT WAS IT SOMEBODY MENTIONED EARLIER. I MEAN IS THAT THE DIRECT CORRELATION ARE WE JUST SAY MORE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY JUST PARTICIPATING IN GAMES. THE REASON GAMES I'M SORRY I GOT. SURE THE REASON WHY WE KNOW THAT MORE MONEY IS BEING DRIVEN EDUCATION NOW VERSUS TEN YEARS AGO IS BECAUSE THE HIGH ASHI BILL REMOVE THE CAP ON PRICES. PREVIOUSLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN THE LOTTERY ACT WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS 50% OF THE VOTERS. THERE IS A CAP OF 50% OF WHAT COULD BE SPENT ON PRICES BY PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY ON THE PRICES THAT ALLOWS A LOTTERY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE PRODUCTS. AND THAT DRIVE SALES. SO MORE SALES MEANS MORE REVENUES MORE REVENUES MEANS MORE MONEY TO EDUCATION. GOT IT BUT THE I THINK MISTRAL NOT TO BROUGHT THIS POINT UP EVEN THOUGH THE REVENUES GONE UP THE PERCENTAGE HAS GONE DOWN. RIGHT SO IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT THE PERCENTAGE BACK IN. YOU KNOW IT IS STRAIGHT OF REALLY SOMEBODY WOULD ARGUE YOU KNOW SOME OF THAT MONEY'S BEEN MISUSED. I MEAN WHAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSE TO THAT WELL SITUATES WOULD ASK I WOULD SAY FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE FOUND THAT IN THE IN THE I THINK ONE OF THE REPORTS SAY YOUR ALLUDING TO. A FINDING OF ABOUT THRE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS IMPORTANT WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT. WE WOULD SEE THOUGH WE WOULD COMPARE THAT TO THE FACT THAT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH. SOME OF THE FINDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN INDICATED MEASURE THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND WE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE PROBLEMS. ADMINISTRATIVELY SO THAT THE HOPEFULLY WILL NOT BE REPEATED. WE THINK THAT THE OVERALL STRUCTURAL CHANGES THE PRICE FLEXIBILITY GRANTED. BY THE LEGISLATURE TEN YEARS AGO. HAS RESULTED IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. WE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT AS WE WERE TALKING EARLIER WITH THE COMMITTEES HERE THAT. BY IDENTIFYING EFFICIENCIES WITHIN OUR OPERATIONS WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO FUNCTION UNDERNEATH THE EFFECTIVE CAP OF THIRTEEN PERCENT. AND WE SENT THAT DIFFERENCE BACK TO SCHOOLS. OKAY THANK YOU THINK MISTER. THANK YOU JUST QUESTIONS ON ON MY AND I'M- JUST GOING TO. FINANCE A TO LOGGER PER PER PER SENATORS IN TERMS OF THE BREAK OUT TO EDUCATION IN TERMS OF THE- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FUNDING GOT ONE POINT THREE FOR K. TWELVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE. FIVE MILLION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU SIXTY THREE YOU SEE FORTY TWO HOW IS THAT ALLOCATION DETERMINED. LED BY THE CONTROL. I KNOW YOU ASKED EARLIER I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT SO THE STATE COMPTROLLER PERFORMS A LOT OF OUR FINANCIALS EVERY QUARTER AND IT THEY THEY TRANSFER THE MONEY TO THE EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES BASED SOLELY ON THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FORMULAS. SO IT'S JUST A FUNCTION OF THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE WITHIN ALL THOSE ENTITIES. THE. I'M NOT JUST SAYING SO HOW DO YOU SAY HOW DO YOU DETERMINE ONE POINT THREE THREE TWO K. TWELVE VERSUS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE MILLION TWO CAN COLLEGES. SO IS K. TWELVE HAS THE MAJORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT ALSO JUST BE IT JUST BASED ON. SO BODIES ROOF CORRECT OKAY UC'S IS. IT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE CORRECT TO MAKE SEE THEY WANT TO GO BACK AND CHECK IT TO ME JUST FOR EXAMPLE JUST I DON'T HAVE THE STUDENTS IN FRONT OF ME BUT JUST YOU SEE CSU I MEAN. I THOUGHT CSU HAD MORE THAN. BUT I COULD BE WRONG. BUT YEAH YES RIGHT YES WHY SEASON WITH THAT MISTER SHERMAN AND REPORT BACK BUT AS HAS BEEN INDICATED THE FORMULA IS DETERMINED BY THE SIMPLY AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IN THE SEGMENTS SO THE LOTTERY DOESN'T CONTROL WHERE THE MONEY GOES OR HOW MUCH EITHER. EACH OF THE SEGMENTS GETS. THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS SAID IN BY THE PROPOSITION OR IS THAT A STATURE. IN THE PROPOSITIONS. THEN. GOING TO BACK TO YOUR EXPENDITURES AND JUST TO REVENUE SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE A REVENUE CHART I SURE MISTER OBERNOLTE SKEPTICISM NIGHT EITHER I DON'T I DON'T KNOW I DON'T SIT ON GEO SO MAYBE HE DOES BETTER I STILL SURE THE SKEPTICISM IN TERMS OF THE INCREASE OF REVENUE BEING DRIVEN BY THE PRICES DO YOU HAVE ANY. DATA OR STUDIES THAT SORT OF CORROBORATE THAT. THE CRIME RATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRICES AND REVENUE YES. WOMEN'S STUDIES ON THE ICE AS HE NODDED YES SO THE PART OF THE WHAT INFLUENCED THE HI ACTUALLY BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS WITH THE LOTTERY AT THAT TIME CONSULTED WITH AN OUTSIDE ENTITY TO LOOK AT THAT. RELATIONSHIP AS WAS NOTED. CALIFORNIA OF WAS. BEHIND SOME OF THE OTHER NATIONAL LOTTERIES THAT ALREADY HAVE THE PRICE LOOKS ABILITY SO THIS INDEPENDENT FIRM. CONFIRMS THE CORRELATION OBVIOUSLY THERE IT'S A BALANCE THERE COMES A POINT WHERE. I LIKE TO GIVE THE EXTREME EXAMPLE WE GET OFF A GAME THAT OFFERS A 100% PRIZE PAYOUT. PEOPLE LINED UP TO PLAY THAT GAME BECAUSE EVERY TICKET WINS. WE'D OBVIOUSLY LOSE MONEY WE WOULDN'T GENERATE FUNDING TO EDUCATION SO WE WOULD NEVER DO SUCH A THING. BUT THAT ILLUSTRATES THE THERE'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU. OFFERED TO LET THE PLAYERS TO INCENTIVIZE THE SALES AND WHAT WE'RE GIVING TO EDUCATION. THE TOTAL AGREE I'M NOT ONE WHICH IS WHAT I LOOK AT YOUR YOUR HAND OUT THIS IS THE HANNAH YOU YOU HAD A RIGHT YES SIR IF I IF I JUST LOOK AT THE- BLUE LINE OF REVENUE. YOU COULD YOU COULD COME TO YOUR CONCLUSION WHICH SAYS THAT YOU KNOW WE OFFER MORE PRICES SO WHEN I. DID TO ME THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ECONOMIC CYCLE. THIS LOOKS LIKE. AMIR IS THE EXACT. THE NEAREST ECONOMY. WHAT THE NEAR STATE REVENUE SO. SO TO ME THE QUESTION IS IF YOU IF WE DID NOTHING WOULD WE HAVE GOTTEN. A SIMILAR INDICATION JUST BECAUSE- OF ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND- THIS IS. THIS IS WHAT NATURALLY WOULD HAVE JUST OCCURRED REGARDLESS OF. THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE TWENTY TO EDUCATION. AND I WOULD SAY THAT SO IF YOU IF EXTENDED THE CHART BEYOND THE YEARS WERE SHOWING THE SIR DURING THE .COM BOOM FOR EXAMPLE THE SALES AND COUNTRIES IN EDUCATION WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR IN LINE WITH THE ECONOMY AT THAT TIME SO. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE LOTTERY WAS KIND OF FINDING OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT ITS CONFUSION EDUCATION WERE. SO IF WE STAY ON THE PATH WE WERE ON WE'VE- THE- LOGIC IS THAT WOULD BE AT THE CLUB. COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE AT THAT TIME WHAT WAS THAT. DID DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP INTEREST IN AMONG THE PLAYERS AND WITH THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE WERE UNDER WITH THE PAST TENSE THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO OFFER MORE TYPES OF GAMES THAT PLAYERS WOULD. I AM INTERESTING SYSTEM PRE AB NINETY. ONE ONE FOR YOU LOOKS LIKE A SPEAK FIVE OH SIX AND WENT DOWN. IS THAT BECAUSE THEY LOST INTEREST. OR THAT BECAUSE THE ECONOMY STARTED GOING DOWN SO THAT'S ACTUALLY. PRIZE PAYOUT COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER GAMES. SO THAT'S THAT'S FOR SURE EXPLAINS THE SPIKE IN CONTRITION AD FOR THAT YEAR. AND WHICH THEN MAKES THE OTHER STUFF RIGHT YEARS LOOK LIKE IN A DECLINE. ENERGY YOU CAN SEE SIMILAR SPIKES IN TWO THOUSAND LEVIN TWELVE THAT WAS. MEGA MILLIONS JACKPOT GOT UP TO SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS THE RECORD AT THAT TIME. SIMILARLY AND IN TWO THOUSAND. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THAT'S WHEN POWER BALL GOT TO ADVERTISE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS A RECORD AT THAT TIME. YEAH BUT I CRAZY ARE YOU THAT'S JUSTICE INDICATOR OF THE- TIMES IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO SPEND AT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN FOOD AND A LOT OF THE GONNA BUY FOOD RIGHT. SO IN TERMS OF. SINCEFUNDS IT COULD JUST BE A FUNCTION OF GOOD ECONOMIC INDICATORS RATHER THAN OF. WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE LOTTERY LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION WHAT'S THE WHAT'S WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I ASK YOU WHAT'S WHAT'S THE CORE MISSION OF THE LOTTERY. OF OTHER DEPARTMENTS THE AGENCY CORE CORE MISSION THE CORE MISSION ISTO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION THAT'S RIGHT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. THEN THAT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE SO I GOT A QUESTION SO IN TERMS OF PERSONAL COST BASED ON THE LA CHART. IS IT CORRECT THAT PERSONNEL COSTS FROM ALWAYS TO NINE TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WENT FROM ABOUT. FORTY NINE MILLION. TO ONE OH ONE MILLION THIS IS JUST STRAIGHT ON PAGE TWO OF THE ATLANTA. THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE CASE FROM THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ON THE CHART YES. GOT SO I GUESS WANT ONE QUESTION WHY LOOK AT PERSONNEL COSTS AND THE PERSONAL COST. IN THE BEING ROUGHLY ABOUT 15% OF OVERALL EXPENSES. NOT JUST PERSONAL COST. I JUST DO I JUST DID DIVISION YOU COULD YOU COULD TAKE A CALCULATOR WHICH IS WHICH IS WHAT I DID I DIDN'T. MR OBERNOLTE DOESN'T IN THIS HAD I USED TO COME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THE NUMBERS MYSELF BUT WHAT YOU SAY SOUNDS REASONABLE AND PROBABLY CORRECT SIR. I THINK I CAN I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE BIT. CONCERNING SOME WONDERING. YOU HAVE THIS ALMOST AS MANY EMPLOYEES AS THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE LEGISLATORS ABOUT THOUSAND SO SIMPLE USING YOUR ABOUT A HUNDRED I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. WHAT ON WHAT WHAT THE HELL EIGHT HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS DO INJURE YOUR PERSONAL CASA HUNDRED MILLION IS MORE IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU GIVE TO UC AND CSU COMBINED. SO TO ME MY CONCERN REAP WHAT THE REASONS WERE HAVING THE HEARING IS. THE PERCEPTION AND THIS IS. WHY YOU'RE HERE MISTER JOHNSON BECAUSE YOU'RE KIND OF RIGHT THE SHIP. THE PERCEPTION ISN'T THAT. THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION IS. TO FUND EDUCATION THE MISSION SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE IN THE GAMING BUSINESS AND. PART OF THE PRIZE MONEY GOES TO EDUCATION LIKE EDUCATION YOU WANT RIGHT. SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS HERE WE WERE YOU HEARING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS YOU LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT. COSTS OF THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES ONLY ONE POINT SIX COAST EDUCATION. WELL I'D LIKE TO START MISTER CHAIRMAN BY ADDRESSING THE POINT YOU RAISED EARLIER IN YOUR COMMENTS ARE EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN EMPLOYEES CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES WORK HARD TO SERVE THE MISSION OF A LOTTERY TO SUPPLEMENT EDUCATION FUNDING AND THEY SERVICE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE STATE AND- A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS BASED ON ATTRACTING AND WORKING WITH AND SERVICING. THOSE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS. WE OPERATE NINE DISTRICT OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE WITH TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ONE IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT THE OVERALL GOALS OF OUR LEADERSHIP AS EMBODIED IN THE COMMISSION AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND EVEN PRIOR ADMINISTRATIONS HAS BEEN WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO SELL THIS PRODUCT. MAXIMIZE THOSE SALES WITH THE HARDWORKING STAFF THAT WE HAVE I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE MET QUITE A FEW OF THE FOLKS HEADQUARTERED IN SACRAMENTO AND- MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN THERE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND THEY TAKE THEIR JOBS VERY SERIOUSLY. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO DO OUR JOB BETTER THAT'S WHY I'VE ORDERED A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OUR POLICIES PROCEDURES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENTLY FOLLOWED SO WE DON'T HAVE THE KINDS OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. I WANT TO FIND EFFICIENCIES SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE OUR MINISTRY FOR PRETTY EVEN MORE IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. BUT I THINK THAT THE MISSION IS ALWAYS BEEN HOW DO WE DO IT IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE. OKAY SO. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT'S OKAY. SO ONE ONE IN. FOR EVERY SEVEN DOLLARS ONE DOLLAR GOES INTO RETAIL COST CAME COST PERSONAL COSTS. AND MARKETING COSTS. SORRY I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S THE. MODEL OF EFFICIENCY. IN ADDITION THE AS THE LA NOTED REVENUES HAVE GONE UP A HUNDRED AND 34% BUT. MONEY TO EDUCATION ONLY WENT UP 60% SO THAT THAT TO ME STRIKES ME AS AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN YOUR MISSION AND YOUR. A AND YOUR YOUR YOUR- YOUR BUSINESS MODEL. WELL THE BUSINESS MODEL SIR IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THERE'S AS WE'VE JUST AS WELL AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND TALK ABOUT THIS HEARING THERE'S A TIGHT CORRELATION BETWEEN. THE PRICES THAT THE LOTTERY CAN OFFER THE EXPENSE TO OFFER THOSE PRICES AND- THE RELATED OVERHEAD AND SO WE KNOW THAT IF WE CHANGE THE PRICE STRUCTURE IF WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO PRICES THERE WOULD BE LESS SALES. WE THINK THAT THE BEST METRIC FOR DETERMINING THE LOTTERY SUCCESS IN MEETING ITS MISSION IS THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS DRIVEN EDUCATION OKAY LET'S GO DON'T AYE AYE AYE FALL THE METRIC SO. USING THAT SAME MINDSET FROM EIGHT TOLD NOW. THE REVENUES IN TERMS OF MONEY TOWARDS EDUCATION IS SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT. THE INCREASE IS ABOUT THAT RANGE YES I. BUT THE REVENUES WENT UP FOR BILLION DOLLARS. SO ONLY 15% OF YOUR REVENUES WENT TO YOUR CORE MISSION. WELL THAT IS SEEM TO GET WE ALL ESTABLISH WILL AGREE THERE'S NO ARGUMENT WITH WITH THE MISSION. WE'RE JUST WONDERING WHY THERE'S NO MORE MONEY GOING TO EDUCATION. SO YOU HAD THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT ELSEWHERE. IT GOES SURPRISES IT GOES TO OUR RETAILERS IT GOES TO OUR VENDORS THE COST OF IN. QUESTION WE'RE WENT IT'S RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF US THIS IS ALL CONTROL WE'RE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT THE AUDITOR'S WE'RE NOT ARGUING OVER WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING YES OR WHETHER IT WAS MISAPPROPRIATED WAIT WAIT WHAT WE'RE ASKING THIS IN TERMS OF THE MISSION. RIGHT THE OVERALL MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION IS MORE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS SIDE A TIME WHEN REVENUES WENT UP A HUNDRED AND FINDING YOUR MAIN CORE MISSION ONLY WENT UP 60% AND HOW WAS IT THAT WHILE YOU INCREASED. FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ONLY SIX HUNDRED MILLION OF THE WINTER EDUCATION WHICH IS ONLY A 15% ALLOCATION. EVEN A LOWER PERCENTAGE RIGHT ME. IT'S A IT'S A LOWER PERCENTAGE THE WHERE YOU START. SO TO ME THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU YOUR MISSION HAS BEEN ERODED. WELL I KNOW I KNOW FROM MY OWN REVIEW THE FIGURE SIR THAT. ESSENTIALLY A LOT OF THE DIFFERENCES IN MORE PRICES. IN TERMS OF WHERE THE MONEY HAS BEEN SHIFTED. AND WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE PRIZES THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THE SALES. OKAY SURPRISES WHEN UP THREE BILLION DURING THE SAME TIME. SIX HUNDRED WENT TO EDUCATION SO FOUR HUNDRED. INTO EVERYTHING ELSE. I'M SORRY SIR I WAS IT WAS CONFIRMD AFTER WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION SIR NOTED NO I I'M JUST I'M JUST A. MAKING STATE SO AGAIN YOU. YOUR SAYS SO YOU'RE SAYING WHERE THE MONEY WENT RIGHT SO THREE BILLION WENT TO PRICES. SIX HUNDRED MILLION WENT EDUCATION FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WENT TO EXPENSES. OTHER EXPENSES ALL THE DIFFERENT EXPENSES HERE. SO I THINK THE QUESTION IS. COULD THERE BE OTHER LESS PRIZE MONEY OR LESS EXPENSES AND MORE MONEY GOING TO EDUCATION. WELL WE THINK THAT IF THERE WAS A BIT BECAUSE THE WHOLE REASON YOU'RE A STATE EMPLOYEE DURING EXISTENCE IS TO FUND EDUCATION. BUT IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE THE WITH THE ONE THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS. YOU'RE THE SCHOOLS ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THAT REALLY WHAT YOU'VE MANAGES TO REALLY INCREASE. THIS LOTTERY ENTERPRISE. I MEAN THAT. THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THAT HAVE GROWN FROM ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED. MILLION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION. SO THAT'S DOUBLE BUT THE EDUCATION FUNDING HAS DOUBLED. SO THAT SEEMS LIKE THE ONLY SUCCESS HAS BEEN THAT THE ORGANIZATIONS. GROWN WHAT THE TIME THE PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY TO EDUCATION HAS GROWN. IN A SIMILAR MANNER. WELL. I KNOW THAT IF WE REDUCE THE MONEY FOR PRICES WOULD REDUCE SALES AND ALL THE MONEY. WOULD BE DIMINISH THE PIE WOULD BE SMALL. I KNOW THAT IF WE CHANGE WHAT WE PAY THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY FOR SALES AS WELL. I KNOW THAT. A LOT OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO WHAT WE PAY OUR VENDORS ARE CONTRACTUAL AND THAT. THOSE ARE MULTI YEAR CONTRACTS THAT THE STATE HAS COMMITMENTS AND- ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE ASKED TO HAVE TO DO IS THESE CONTRACTS COME UP FOR RENEWAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE BEST DEAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I CAN'T TELL YOU TODAY WHETHER THAT WOULD RESULT IN COST SAVINGS BUT I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE OFFER TERMS THAT ARE BETTER FOR THE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE SERVE INSTEAD OF. BETTER SUITED TO THE VENDORS INTERESTS. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS WE CAN DO OUR JOBS BETTER. WITH LESS THAN TWO MONTHS ON THE JOB I CAN'T GIVE YOU A FIRM SOLUTION FOR. US ON THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK SUCH AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT THE NUMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE PLAIN ME INDICATE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. BUT AGAIN HAVE AND JUST JUST TAKING A- LOOK IT SEEMS LIKE. AGAIN I THINK THE LOTTERY HAS SORT OF LOSSES WHERE. YOU HAVE AN ORGANIZATION. THAT HAS GROWN ITS OPERATION. THAT REALLY ALMOST AT THE EXPENSE OF EDUCATION NOT FOR EDUCATION. AND THAT IS WHERE I THINK WE'RE CONCERNED. EVERY EVERYTHING ELSE HAS COMMENSAL COMMENSURATELY GROW. WHICH IS REVENUES HAVE DOUBLED THE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAS DOUBLED. BUT THE MISSION THE SUPPORTING UP THE MISSION TO EDUCATION HASN'T. SO IT DOESN'T THINK AGAIN IT LOOKS LIKE THE ORGANIZATION HAS SUCCESSFULLY INCREASED THEIR ENTERPRISE WITHOUT REALLY FOR FILLING THEIR CORE MISSION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SHOT. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THAT IS A MAJOR. A MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE. GERMAN YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER VERY SERIOUSLY I CAN TELL YOU LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS OVER THE YEARS THAT. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAVE REMAINED ABOUT 12% SO I THINK THAT. I THINK YOU BETTER DO ENOUGH AGAIN DOES NOT IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU GET THAT 12% IT'S NOT LOOKING TO FACTORY. THIS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CALL A MINISTRY OF EXPENSES TOTAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IT'S ABOUT TWELVE AND A FEW POINTS. ANY TO THE LAST FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU EXCLUDE PRICES AND THAT YOU GET LIKE PRICES IN THAT MANY DEDICATION OF THE YES FOR CLARIFICATION PRIZE EXPENSES NOT MENTION EXPENSE THAT'S A COST OF DOING BUSINESS. SO IF THE INITIAL EXPENSES ARE WHAT WE CARE RETAILERS WHAT WE PAY OUR ARE GAINING PROVIDERS AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE 12% OF ONE NUMBER. THAT TOTAL REVENUES DAHLE SALES REVENUE. TOTAL PERCEPTUAL CELLS REVIEW WHEN SHE TOOK OUT THE PRIZE MONEY. THE BOSS SAYS IN THE PRESS MOODY'S CELLS REVENUE IS JUST PURELY WHAT WE TAKE IN ON THE SALE OF THE PRODUCTS SO THAT'S BEFORE WE PAY OFF PRICES. MAYBE I CAN HELP ON ON THAT ONE. MR MAYBE I CAN HELP ON THAT ONE SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE AM I THINK THE WAY THAT IT BREAKS DOWN IS SIXTY FOUR POINT ABOUT 64% WENT TO PRIZES ABOUT 24% WENT TO EDUCATION AND THEN ABOUT 12% WENT TO EXPENSES. SO THAT COMES OFF OF THE TOTAL SALE NUMBER. OKAY DOES THAT HELP YES. I SEE YOUR PIERCING SO TOTAL PERCENT. RIGHT AND MISTER SHERMAN WE BELIEVE THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN. ROUGHLY FLAT IN THE LAST DECADE TWELVE POINT SOMETHING PERCENT IN EACH OF THE LAST ROUGHLY TEN TO TWELVE FISCAL YEARS. AND AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO SAY THAT THERE ISN'T ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE OUR MISSION WHICH IS TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN SAVE SOME MONEY DOING IT. BY DOING THINGS BETTER EITHER HEADQUARTERS AROUND THE STATE WE WANT TO DO THAT YEAH BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A IT'S UP. THAN DOUBLED SO IN ESSENCE WHAT IS 12% YOUR EXPENSES HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED. AND THERE'S A QUESTION IF THE BULK OF YOUR REVENUE IS REALLY GOING TO PRICES IS FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCY POINT OF VIEW IS A REALLY ORGANIZATION FISH. BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S JUST THE ADMINISTRATION THE ADDITIONAL PRICE MONEY WELL IT DOES COST A LOTTERY MORE TO SELL MORE PRIZES AND BIGGER PRICES THE TRUTH YES SO DO I AM SAMPLE OF THAT IS IT'S ESSENTIALLY WITHIN OUR GAMING OUR PRIMARY GAMING% SYSTEM UNDER WITHIN THE CONTRACT ITSELF IS SPECIFIES A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF SALES THAT GO TOWARD THE VENDOR. SIMILARLY AS DOCTOR JOHNSON EXPLAINS THE RETAILERS ESSENTIALLY GET A FIXED PERCENTAGE PURSUANT TO WATER REGULATIONS OF EVERY TICKET THEY SELL AND SOME OF THE EVERY EVERY TICKET THAT THEY CASH EVERY WINNING TICKET FOR THE CASH SO THOSE ARE KIND OF FIXED PERCENTAGES OF OUR SALES. RIGHT OFF THE TOP WITHIN ADMINISTRATION. I JUST TO GO OVER PHYSICIAN I THINK YOU'RE AFTER COME BACK AND I THINK TAKE I THOUGHT YOU HAD TAKEN A CHANCE TO TAKE A- LITTLE LONGER. CLOSER LOOK AT ALL YOUR DIFFERENT EXPENSES COULD DOES. DOES BEG THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT ORGANIZATION IS REALLY SERVING IT'S REAL MISSION. RATHER THAN IT'S JUST BECOME A GAMING OPERATIONS THAT DONATES ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO EDUCATION. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FEELS MORE TO ME. BUT IT'S A GAMING OPERATION THAT MAKES A DONATION. NOT THINK A GAMING OPERATION THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON. GENERATING MORE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS WHICH IS WHICH IS REALLY. THE PURPOSE. YEAH THE SCRIPTS OF THIS ON THAT SAME LINE OF QUESTIONING I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS AS FAR AS YOUR EMPLOYEE COST I WOULD ASSUME THAT IF YOU'VE HAD A LONG TERM EMPLOYEES THAT THOSE COSTS HAVE GONE UP JUST. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT BE BENEFITS WHETHER IT BE. SO AS WE LOOK AT THAT. WITH HOW MANY EMPLOYEES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES SO THAT ALSO IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE ADDING INTO THAT COST EVERY YEAR. THAT THE AGENCY IS OPERATING AS THE COSTS OF HAVING SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IS THAT ADDED IN THERE MISTER KING. ARE SITTING ON THE WAIST COSTS AS FAR AS. OPERATING THE WHAT'S OUR EMPLOYEES CALL. AND ALL THAT. YES IT WOULD INCLUDE TO THE PERSONAL LINE ITEM IS BASICALLY ALL STAFF COSTS THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING. AND NOW IT'S GONE UP EVERY YEAR OR PROBABLY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO. IT HAS GONE UP OVER THE TEN YEARS AND YOU CAN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO REFERENCE ON PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT. THERE IS A BREAK OUT OF THAT FOR YOU. THANK YOU. SO WHAT QUESTION WOULD WHICH IS JUST GENES CONFERRING WITH STAFF SO HÃ¬NH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YOU OFFER FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN PRICES. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THAT PRIZE ALLOCATION DO YOU SEE DO YOU HAVE A- SET AMOUNT OF CORAL COMPRISES JERKING OFF FOR. GOING INTO THE YEAR. I MEAN I KNOW THAT'S SEPARATE FROM SAY MEGA MILLIONS OF SEPARATE FROM WHEN YOU BUY YOUR LOTTERY TICKETS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST BASED ON. WHO'S BUYING. RIGHT NOW IT IT REALLY IS A FUNCTION OF THAT THAT DRUG INJURIES OR TO EXPLAIN THEY HAVE A OF. A FIXED PRIZE PAYOUT PERCENTAGE AND THAT'S IN THE RULES OF THE GAME THEMSELVES. SCRATCHERS WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY WE HAVE DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS WE CALL THEM SO WE HAVE. OUR CHEAPEST TICKET IS A ONE DOLLAR AND OUR MOST EXPENSIVE IS THIRTY DOLLARS. OBVIOUSLY TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO MOVE UP THAT'S THE PURCHASE CHAIN. WE OFFER MORE PRIZES MORE WINNING EXPERIENCES OF THE MORE. DOES MORE COSTLY THE TICKET. SO IT THE THAT FOUR POINT. FOUR SEVEN BILLION IS A FUNCTION OF. THIS ALSO TO JUST GONE DESCRIBES AS YOU'RE MAKING THE SCRATCHERS TRIED TO COULD YOU GET OR SO IS MAKING YOUR BUYING SCRATCHER WRITTEN. BY X. X. AMOUNT OF. SCRATCHERS SO YOU'RE SAYING IF YOU'RE BUYING. LET'S SAY AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SCRATCHERS. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU THIS IS A SET FORMULA BASED ON THAT PRICE OR- IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT SET THEIR AVERAGES FOR THE PRICES JUST A- THAT POINT SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE DOLLAR GAMES AVERAGE OUT ABOUT 55% THAT WE PAID OUT IN PRIZES THE MOST EXTREME THE THIRTY DOLLAR GAME IS CLOSE AT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. OKAY SO I SHOULD I SHOULD BE PLAYING THIRTY DOLLARS. IF YOU'RE A HIGH ROLLER. OKAY BUT HOW DO HOW DO YOU DETERMINE. I MEAN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE BUYING THE SCRATCHES YOU HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BUDGET AND- ASSUME THE AVERAGE PAYOUT. RE SO THE FOUR ONE FOUR SEVEN SIX IS BASED ON WHAT WE ACTUALLY PAID OUT THOUGH SO IT'S- UNDERSTOOD YEAH THEN THEN YOU TO BREAK IT OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SCRIPTURE VERSES WITH A LOTTERY CRACKED BUT I CAN TELL YOU ROUGHLY PERCENTAGE WISE THE DRAW GAMES WOULD BE ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE SALES OKAY FOR DRAW AND SCRATCHERS ARE AVERAGING ABOUT 64% OKAY. SO THE GOAL GOING INTO THE YEAR YOU'LL SEE. WE'RE GONNA BUDGET ABOUT. TWO AND A HALF BILLION FOR SCRATCHERS. IN THE BASED ON THAT YOU'RE GONNA KNOW ROUGHLY WHAT THE PALE IT'S GOING TO BE BY THE NUMBER OF THIRTY DOLLARS SCRATCHERS VERSUS THE NUMBER ONE DOLLAR SCRATCHERS AND- I ASSUME YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR AWHILE STIFF PRETTY. PRESET NUMBERS ABOUT WE ARE WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S. THANK YOU ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. COMMENTS THOUGHTS OF. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT I DON'T SEE MUCH PUBLIC HERE. NO NO TO REDEEM A LOTTERY TICKET. OKAY GREAT WELL THAT YEAH THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON WELCOME TRANSLATIONS ON YOUR NEW JOB VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALLEY TO PUBLIC FINANCE FOR COMING TODAY I THINK WE HAVE A VERY VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING. WE REALLY WISH YOU BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR NEW JOB REALLY HOPE YOU. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF REALLY HELP HELP LEAD THIS ORGANIZATION AND WE HOPE TO BE A SENIOR NEXT NEXT WINTER WILL BE KIND OF REVISIT. BUDGET OVERALL AGAIN AFTER OUR SESSION. FINISHES THIS YEAR.
