THAT AFTERNOON I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE HERE TO THE STATE CAPITOL INTO THIS HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAMPUS CLIMATE. THIS IS THE FIRST CAMPUS CLIMATE HEARING FOR THE TWENTY SEVEN. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I WON EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO THE PALACE WILL BE HERE TODAY IN THE AUDIENCE WHO TOOK TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES THIS AFTERNOON TO SHARE VALUABLE INSIGHTS. ABOUT VITAL ISSUESCONCERNING OCCURRING ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND UNIVERSITIES. IF ME OUT THERE ARE VARIOUS MEMBERS WHO WILL BE COMING IN AND OUT THE OTHER HEARINGS HADN'T AND MEETINGS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AT THE CAPITOL SO SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE. SELECT COMMITTEE MAY BE COMING IN. AT DIFFERENT TIMES WE LOOK FOR TO THEY ALL HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE WATCHING THE HEARINGS IN THEIR OFFICES. THIS IS OUR FOURTH YEAR HOSTING HEARINGS ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAMPUS CLIMATE. MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN IT'S FOUR YEARS AGO THOSE BECAUSE OF AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT THAT WAS HAPPENING SAN JOSE STATE. AND THE THE ISSUE AT THAT POINT WAS RACE. AND OF THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT OF A LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT STUDENTS RECEIVING ON THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS. AS A RESULT OF THAT THIS COULD THIS PSALM. SELECT COMMITTEE WAS FORMED BY THEY'VE BEEN SPEAKER JOHN PEREZ WHO ASKED ME TO CHAIR OF THE. A CAMPUS CLIMATE COMMITTEE. SINCE THEN. WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO ADDRESS THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT AFFECT STUDENTS. WHETHER STEVEN WITH ISSUES OF RACE OR GENDER. OR IS ANTICIPATED SUBMIT AND I SUBMIT BEHAVIOR UCLA WHILE WE GOT A CROWN THE STATE RAISING ISSUES OF OF CONCERN. TODAY'S TOPIC IS ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS IN THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR. AND IT'S NOT AN UNFAMILIAR TOPIC TO MANY OF YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND DOING AS I WANT TO SAY REALLY IN A FANTASTIC JOB. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS COMMITTEE HELD ITS VERY FIRST HEARING AT SENDING STATE UNIVERSITY ON STUDENT FOOD INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS. WE HAD NO IDEA THAT AT THAT TIME THAT IT WOULD BECOME SUCH A MAJOR ISSUE. OF THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT WE HAVE BEEN APPROACHED ABOUT IT BECAUSE ACTUALLY. HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD INSECURITY HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE LIFE OF STUDENTS AND UPLAND OBVIOUSLY THE CLIMATE THE CAMPUS ITSELF IN TERMS OF HOW STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO MATRICULATED. FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT EXCESSIVELY IN ORDER TO GRADUATE AND SO THAT IS A MAJOR CONCERN IS THERE. WE HEARD FROM STUDENTS AND CAMPUS OFFICIALS FROM SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO AND AROUND THE SAN DIEGO AREA THAT EXPOSED US TO HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. SOMETIMES ON CAMPUSES BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE ALL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN US. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME AS A RESULT WE UNCOVERED A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED WHETHER IT WAS DEALING WITH THE FOOD BANKS AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE. FOR CAMPUSES TO ACTUALLY GET FOOD FROM FOOD BANKS SINCE THEY WORK NONPROFIT AGENCIES OR WHETHER IT'S. LOOKING THE CAMPUS IS A WE HAVE TO HAVE A BILL THIS YEAR THIS LOOKING AT ALL CAMPUSES THAT DON'T HAVE CAO FRESH PROGRAMS IN THEIR COUNTIES. AND HOW DO WE GET THOSE CAL FRESH OF OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUNG PEOPLE THERE SO WE HAVE LEGISLATION THAT OPEN IT UP OPENS IT UP FOR THOSE WHO. ACTUALLY GET OF CAO FRESH FROM STATE AND IF THERE COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE IT. SO THIS YEAR. WE FOUND THAT SO TWENTY FOUR PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS SURVEYED GO OUT NEARLY ONE IN FOUR HAVE FOOD AND SECURITIES. AND THE SAME STUDY ALSO SHOWED THE TEN PERCENT OF C. ISSUE STUDENTS WERE HOMELESS. THE UC STUDY SHOWED THAT NEARLY ONE OF FIVE STUDENTS AT ISSUES WITH FOOD INSECURITY. A YEAR AGO INTO A SIXTEEN THE SELECT COMMITTEE THOUGH IT GIVES AN UPDATE ON WHAT SOME OF THE C. ISSUES AND YOU SEE SAID I HAVE BEEN DOING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. TO ALSO GET AN ADDITIONAL UPDATE. SINCE THE STUDY THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO THE BASIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH THE SEGMENTS RESPONDING IN VARIOUS WAYS. STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY LIKE HAVE GALVANIZED AND RALLIED AROUND THESE ISSUES AND I FIND A VERY HARD THING TO. THOUGH THERE STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN TAKING THE CHARGE. IF ONE OF THE IDEAS OF CAMPUS CLIMATE IS TO PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES AND SUSTAINS ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THEN IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSES TO THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY A RELEVANT. OUR PREFERENCE MOST OF OUR CAMPUS CLIMATE MEETINGS ESTATE AGAIN FOR THIS ONE THIS IS NOT A HEARING DESIGNATED TO LAMB BASS ANY CAMPUS OR SYSTEM. HOWEVER IT IS A HEARING TO AND INTIMATE TO TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT. WE BELIEVE THAT MANY OF YOU WILL BE INSPIRED BY THE HEARING THINGS TO HEAR TODAY ABOUT THE VARIOUS CAMPUSES. IT HAS BEEN TO USE AS A SET SINCE WE'VE DONE AN UPDATE HERE THE CAPITAL AND WAS ONLY A THROUGH THAT PANEL WITH THREE SECONDS OF STUDENTS THAT WILL BE GAVE. ABLE TO NOTIFY IDENTIFY THE VARIOUS NEEDS. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO DIVE DEEPER INTO THE CC BUT THROUGH COLLEGES A C. ISSUES IN THE UC SYSTEM AND STE AND GET THIS CAMPUS I'M A STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE OF. ON THIS LONG STANDING PROBLEM THAT WE FACE. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ONE OF OUR OUR. MEMBERS OF THE CAMPUS CLIMATE COMMITTEE AND I'LL GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WANT TO SAY HELLO MISS TO MEDINA WHO'S AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MR MEDINA. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER AYE I WOULD JUST SAY WELCOME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM STUDENTS. ON THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THAT IS. VERY MUCH A PRESSING.

I WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TODAY TO HAVE WITH US COLEEN GANLEY WHO AMOR EVERMAN. WHO IS THE? WHO'S FROM IS FROM THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE CHANCES OFFICE. WE HAVE NANCY GRASS WHOSE ASSOCIATE DEAN OF SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ALI HUNDRED LOOK. NO MELODIES SHE HERE. OKAY HE I'M SORRY OF THE LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE SO EVERYONE'S HERE WITHIN A BEGAN. AND. HERE FROM A CO LEAD I THINK. WHEN WE GET TO ONE MAN IF YOU WILL GET US A SIGN SAYING YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU. GOOD OUT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRWOMAN WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AT TODAY'S HEARING. AND THANKS TO YOU AND OTHER LEGISLATORS WHO PROVIDED LEGISLATIVE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE BASIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS. MY NAME IS CALLING GALLIUM A SPECIALIST WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MY WORK FOCUSES ON SUPPORTS. FOR BASIC NEEDS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS INCLUDING FOOD HOUSING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WITH IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS WITH A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS. AND WHILE WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE STATEWIDE STINT STATISTICS SPECIFICALLY FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE DO KNOW BASED ON NATIONAL RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE WISCONSIN HOPE LAB THAT TWO OUT OF THREE STUDENTS SURVEYED. REPORT BEING FOOD INSECURE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS REPORT BEING HOUSING INSECURE AND THIRTEEN REPORT BEING HOMELESS. IN CALIFORNIA THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT CONDUCTED THE SYSTEM WIDE FOOD HOUSING SURVEY ACROSS THEIR STUDENT BODY. SIXTY TO OF THE RESPONDENTS REPORTED BEING FOOD INSECURE FIFTY FIVE REPORTED BEING HOUSING INSECURE. AND ALMOST NINETEEN PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS SURVEYED AND IT WAS CLOSE TO SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS REPORTED BEING HOMELESS SO I FIND THAT RATHER STAGGERING. IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGES AS THEY WORK TO SUPPORT THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. WE ARE SO PLEASED TO HAVE JUST HOSTED THE FIRST EVER CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASIC NEEDS SUMMIT. NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS ATTENDED THIS EVENT TO LEARN ABOUT BEST PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES IN SUPPORTING THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. IN PREPARATION WE WE DO HOPE TO MAKE THIS AN ANNUAL OR BIANNUAL EVENT IN PREPARATION FOR IMPLEMENTING THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS CAMPAIGN WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONDUCTED A SYSTEM WIDE SURVEY REGARDING REGARDING FOOD SECURITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS. NINETY TWO OF THE COLLEGES HUNDRED FIVE OF THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES RESPONDED. SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT REPORTED THE AVAILABILITY OF CAMPUS BASED FOOD PANTRIES. FORTY EIGHT PERCENT REPORT HAVE REPORTED ONGOING COLLABORATION WITH THEIR LOCAL FOOD BANKS AND ALMOST SIXTY TWO PERCENT REPORTED THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPORT SERVICES TO STUDENTS COMPLETING CAO FRESH APPLICATIONS. WE USED THIS SURVEY DATA TO DEVELOP A BEST PRACTICES GUIDE WHICH WE CAN PROVIDE TO YOU ELECTRONICALLY AND WILL BE DOING. DISSEMINATE ACROSS OUR SYSTEM EARLY NEXT WEEK. A IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTING THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS FUNDS WE UTILIZED EXISTING APPORTIONMENT PROCESSES TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. TO ALL SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS HUNDRED FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE ALLOCATIONS ENABLED A MULTITUDE OF FOOD SECURITY ACTIVITIES INCLUDING PROVIDING CAL FRESHEN WRONG INFORMATION AND ENROLLMENT SUPPORT TO STUDENTS. EXPANDING CAMPUS BASED FOOD PANTRIES ESTABLISHING HOT MEAL VOUCHER PROGRAMS DEVELOPING MEAL DEVOTION DONATION GIVE BACK PROGRAMS PROVIDING FINANCIAL LITERACY TRAINING TO STUDENTS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS CAMPAIGN WE PARTNERED WITH OUR CSU PARTNERS AND HOSTED ELEVEN. REGIONAL TRAININGS THAT FOCUSED ON THE COW FRESHENED ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF FACULTY AND STAFF WOULD BE PREPARED TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE INTEREST IN THESE TROLLS WE HAD EIGHTY TWO OF THE COLLEGES SEND FACULTY AND STAFF WE TRAINED OVER FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS. SO THERE WAS A VERY HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE. FACING FOOD INSECURITY. PRETTY GRAND UMP LEVELS. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS TO HELP COLLEGES CREATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR LOCAL FOOD BANKS AND WITH THEIR COUNTY CAL FRESH STAFF. CRITICAL TO CREATE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COUNTY PARTNERS INCLUDING FOOD BANKS AND CAL FRESH COUNTY TEAMS AS THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL ALLOW LEVERAGING EXISTING RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS. THERE'S SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO CREATE LONG TERM INFRASTRUCTURE THE ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATION PROVIDED BY THE STATE ALLOWED THE COLLEGES TO INVEST. IN FOOD PANTRY SERVICES CALPERS TRAINING AND TO DEVELOP THOSE LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS. IN TERMS OF HOUSING RESOURCES THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO NOT OFFER CAMPUS BASED HOUSING ELEVEN OF OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN HAVE ON CAMPUS HOUSING HOWEVER COLLEGES WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. ARE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY BASED HOUSING PROGRAM CALLED HOVHANESS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE OR BE FAMILIAR WITH HOVHANESS. IT'S AN INITIATIVE THAT THEY CALL THE COLLEGE SUCCESS INITIATIVE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM HOMELESS STUDENTS RECEIVE HOUSING NAVIGATION SERVICES RAPID RE HOUSING SERVICES RENT SUBSIDIES AND OTHER CASE MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE A FEW HOUSING BILLS ON THE SENATE SIDE HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GARNER SOME SUPPORT SENATE BILL NINE EIGHTEEN AND SENATE BILL NINE TWELVE. ARE BOTH. TAP BEING HOUSING DOLLARS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO LOOK TO TAP HOUSING DOLLARS FOR HOUSING NEEDS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. I HAVE MORE THINGS BUT. I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME IF YOU HAVE ANY. SOUNDS GREAT YES. IT'S NEXT. WHO WAS A GREAT LIFT? I GOOD AFTERNOON CHERUB WEBER AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. I TO SAY THAT I'M SO PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY WOULD BE A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT I AM BEYOND HONORED TO BE HERE TO REPRESENT% THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. ON THE ISSUE OF BASIC NEEDS SECURITY FOR STUDENTS IS ONE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US AS EDUCATORS AND ONE THAT HAS BEEN UNRESOLVED FOR WAY TOO LONG AND AS YOU ALREADY KNOW. THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAVING BECAUSE IT IT IT IT'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE ALREADY AND TWEAK. THE SKY'S THE LIMIT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD POSSIBLY ACCOMPLISH. MY NAME IS DOCTOR NANCY GRASS AND I'M HE ASSOCIATED ASSOCIATE DEAN OF STUDENT LIFE AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE. AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR FOOD SECURITY PROGRAMS IN A PART OF THE TEAM OF BASIC NEEDS FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INTRACTABLE. INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING TODAY. THE QUESTION THAT I ALWAYS. KIND OF PONDER SINCE MY TWENTY PLUS YEARS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS IF STUDENTS DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP TONIGHT. AND WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM HOW CAN THEY POSSIBLY STUDY FOR CHEMISTRY EXAM OR WRITE A PAPER. WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THE RESEARCHERS SHOWN THAT. ZIP CODE AND INCOME LEVELS ARE A BETTER PREDICTOR OF STUDENT SUCCESS THEN ALL OF THE HER ROBE EFFORTS THAT WE WE PUT FORWARD FOR THE MUCH NEEDED LEARNING RESOURCES WE PROVIDE. BUT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET IF THEY'RE TRAVELING THREE HOURS BY BUS TO GET TO US. THREE HOURS HOME AND WORKING ALL NIGHT AND HAVE NO WHERE TO EAT OR SLEEP. HOW NO AMOUNT OF EXTRA TUTORING OR BASIC SKILLS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY MOVE THAT EQUITY NEEDLE? AS A PROFESSOR FOR NINETEEN YEARS I LEARNED VERY EARLY ON. I HAD STUDENTS COMING TO CLASS HUNGRY I HAD SOME THAT WOULD COME TO CLASS WHO HADN'T SLEPT BECAUSE THEY JUST SIMPLY HAD NOWHERE TO SLEEP. SO I WOULD KEEP LIKE MANY PROFESSORS WATER BOTTLES PROTEIN BARS CANDY COOKIES STACKS FRUIT IN MY OFFICE TO GIVE OUT TO HUNGRY STUDENTS. BUT THAT'S SUCH A SMALL FRACTION. THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I SUIT MY CURRENT RULE AS ASSOCIATE DEAN I GOT THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH THE ASSOCIATED STUDENT GOVERNMENT LEADERS. WHO IDENTIFIED FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY AS THE MOST CHALLENGING OBSTACLE THAT THEY FACE AND TRYING TO GET THEIR EDUCATION? AND IT WAS WITH THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP OUR FIRST TO FOOD SECURITY PROGRAMS AT SMC. ARE FREE LUNCH VOUCHER PROGRAM WE CALL FLAVOR AND OUR GALLEY FLUTE FOOD CLOSET PROGRAM. A YEAR AFTER THAT WE OUT OF A FREE FARMER'S MARKET AND TODAY THANKS TO THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS ALLOCATION WE ARE BUSILY TRYING TO EXPAND. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE CAL FRESH. OUTREACH PROGRAM. THE HUNGER FREE ALLOCATION IS ALSO MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DEVISE A PLAN FOR MAKING EACH OF THESE PROGRAM SELF SUSTAINING. A BUT ACTUAL C. IT'S GOING TO TAKE US SOME TIME TO DO THAT. OF THE FLAVOR LUNCH PROGRAM PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED O. TO A. VOUCHER OR. PROVIDES VOUCHERS TO TWO HUNDRED OF OUR MOST NEEDY STUDENTS WE GIVE THEM FIFTEEN VOUCHERS A SEMESTER. THAT GETS THEM ONE HOT MEAL A WEEK IN THE CAFETERIA. THE PROGRAM PROGRAM IS COSTING US ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR CURRENTLY. AND IT HAS BEEN BY THE GENEROSITY OF ARE ASSOCIATED STUDENT GOVERNMENTS THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. IT IS BUILT ON A STUDENT SUCCESS MODEL WHICH REQUIRES THE PARTICIPANTS TO VISIT WITH AN ACADEMIC COUNSELOR THREE TIMES A SEMESTER. AND IT ALSO A REQUIRES THAT THEY MAKE CONSISTENT ACADEMIC PROGRESS AS LONG AS THEY'RE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. AND AGAIN THIS WAS DESIGNED BY STUDENTS FOR STUDENTS. I THE GALLEY FOOD CLOSET PROGRAM IS A DECENTRALIZED FOOD PACKED PANTRY THE PROVIDES FOOD DISTRIBUTION CABINETS IN HIGH NEED AREAS SO WE HAVE ONE IN ATHLETICS ONE IN OUR BLACK LEGIONS OF ADELANTE PROGRAM OFFICE. ONE IN OUR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER ONE ANY. I THINK IT'S AN ETHIOPIAN ASSN ALSO A STUDENT LIFE. STUDENTS CAN ACCESS THESE BECAUSE IT'S TO PHILIP A BAG OF GROCERIES TO TAKE HOME AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE A SELECTION OF GRAB AND GO ITEMS SO IF THEY'RE HUNGRY ON THE SPOT. IN THE SIXTEEN MONTHS SINCE WE STARTED THAT PROGRAM THE CLOSETS ARE PROVIDED OVER TEN THOUSAND POUNDS OF FOOD. TO STUDENTS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PURCHASE FOR TWO CENTS A POUND FROM THE WEST SIDE FOOD BANK. A GREAT COMMUNITY PARTNER. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF LEADING A SMALL GROUP OF FACULTY AND STAFF TO EXPAND ON A STUDENT INSPIRED BY ANNUAL FREE FARMER'S MARKET THAT WAS TIED TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY WEEKS. TODAY THE CORSAIR MARKET PROVIDES A FIFTEEN HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND POUNDS OF FRESH PRODUCE EVERY WEDNESDAY TO OVER TWO HUNDRED HUNGRY MINDS. AND LET ME TELL YOU TAKES ONE OUR FIRST TO GO THROUGH THAT FOOD THE STUDENTS LINE UP AND WE'VE GOT OUR BEHALF OF VOLUNTEERS LINED UP AND WE JUST FILL THEIR GROCERY BAGS AND TAKES AN HOUR TO GO THROUGH FIFTEEN HUNDRED. TO TWO THOUSAND POUNDS OF VEGETABLES AND FRUIT. AND THOSE STUDENTS ARE SO GRATEFUL. ALTHOUGH THE MARKET IT'S ONLY BEEN RUNNING DURING THE FALL AND SPRING SEMESTERS WERE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY YET TO DO IT IN THE INTERCESSIONS. WE'VE ALREADY DISTRIBUTED OVER FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF FOOD WHICH IS ALSO SUPPLIED BY THE WEST SIDE FOOD BANK AND ALSO THROUGH THE ORGANIZATION FOOD FORWARD. THE MARKET IS RUN BY A TEAM OF MOSTLY OF VOLUNTEER FACULTY STAFF AND STUDENTS WHO. PICK UP THE FOOD FROM THE FOOD BANK THEY GO TO THE FARMERS MARKET TO GLEAN THE FOOD THEY DELIVER IT THEY SET THE ENTIRE MARKET UP. THE DISTRIBUTE ALL THE FOOD AND THEN AFTERWARDS THEY PROCESS ALL THE DATA SO THAT WE CAN GET CLEAN NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING BECAUSE WE KNEW YOU GUYS WOULD WANT. THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS ALLOCATION HAS BEEN CRITICAL IN MOVING ALL THESE PROGRAMS FROM SMALL STUDENT AND VOLUNTEER STAFF. PROJECTS TO INSTITUTIONALIZED INITIATIVES BUT IS ALSO ALLOWED US TO HIRE A TEMPORARY FOOD SECURITY CONSULTANT WHO'S PROVIDED US WITH A LOT OF BEST PRACTICES FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND SHE'S ALSO BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING US TO DEVELOP OUR CAL FRESH OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT EFFORTS. BY A PROVIDING CALPERS TRAINING SHE'S BEEN PARTNERING WITH LA COUNTY FOR WITH IT FOR US. AND WE'RE HAVING OUR FIRST EVER CAL FRESH DAY NEXT WEEK. WHERE SHE'S ARRANGED TO HAVE FIVE TO SIX COUNTY FOLKS COME AND WE'VE GOT APPOINTMENTS SET UP ALL OVER CAMPUS FOR STUDENTS TO SIGN UP FOR CONFERENCE ROOM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT? WERE MAKING IT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS SELF SUSTAINING THROUGH A FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN AT SMC CALLED NINETEEN TWENTY NINE. THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE BEGAN. AND LIKE THE FOLKS IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING SOME REALLY SERIOUS CHALLENGES. SO SIMILAR TO THE CASH REGISTER DONATIONS THAT WE'VE ALL BECOME FAMILIAR WITH. YOU KNOW DONATE TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. WE'VE CONVINCED ALL FOR FOR ON CAMPUS VENDORS TO. ENCOURAGE CUSTOMERS TO DONATE TWENTY NINE CENTS A CHECKOUT. FOR EVERY NINETEEN PEOPLE TO DONATE TWENTY NINE CENTS THAT VICE ONE STUDENT A HOT MEAL. ARE WE ALSO INVITING FACULTY AND STAFF TO DO PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS OF NINETEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY NINE CENTS. A MONTH WHICH GIVES US OVER FOR MORE MEALS. AND ALSO WORKING WITH OUR FOUNDATION TO. GET COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO DONATE AS WELL. WE ESTIMATE THAT. WE CAN RAISE ENOUGH ONGOING MONEY TO MINIMALLY FUND EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT JUST JUST KIND OF WHAT WORK. PIT WHAT IT'S COSTING US NOW IS ROUGHLY FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ALL OF THEM. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE US ABOUT TWO YEARS TO GET THERE. IN THE MEANTIME THE HUNGER FREE FUNDING IS ALL WE HAVE. IT'S WHAT'S GETTING A STARTED IS WHAT WE'RE HOPING WILL HELP KEEP US GOING. AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ITS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE FROM TAKING THESE FROM LITTLE. INDIVIDUALS WORKING AROUND CAMPUS TO GET STUFF DONE TO BEING ABLE TO MAKE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. MY DREAM IS THAT EVERY STUDENT ENROLLED IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE HAS ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE HOT MEAL EVERY DAY. AND AS THEY SAY THAT IS PRETTY LOW HANGING FRUIT. WITHOUT THE CURRENT FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS ARE LEFT TO HOPE THAT A FEW COMMITTED INDIVIDUALS TAKE UP THIS WORK AND CARRYING ON. THAT CARRIED ON UNSUPPORTED AND UNCOMPENSATED WITHOUT THESE FUNDS AND CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT WE NOW KNOW IS SO BIG. IN CLOSING YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT I ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AS PRUDENT HOUSING SECURITY. NOT IN SECURITY. THAT'S BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH AND SECURITY ALREADY WHAT WE NEED. IS A LONG TERM CONSISTENT AND REAP RELIABLE BASIC NEED SECURITY PLAN FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE IT FOR THEM TODAY THEY MAY NOT BE WILLING OR EVEN ABLE TO PROVIDE IT FOR US IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. I HUNGER. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON VOUCHER WEBER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND ADVOCATES FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND IT IS ALL HODGE LAMELLAE WITH THE STUDENTS AND FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNE COLLEGE AND A PROUD SUDAN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE SITTING TO HOPEFULLY PURSUE A CAREER IN CORAL JUSTICE. I THINK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AND GIVING US ALL HERE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON ISSUES AROUND FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY THAT IMPACT THE NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS. AND USE THE PHRASE A NUMBER BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT AS COLLEEN MENTIONS WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED BY THESE ISSUES. BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE THERE. EATING IN OUR CLASSROOMS SITTING IN OUR LIBRARIES AND EVEN SOMETIMES SLEEPING IN OUR OWN PARKING LOTS. I THINK WE SAW UNDERSTAND THE SENSE HILDA COMES ALONG WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS. EVEN AFTER EXPLAINING THAT SLEEPING ON A DIFFERENT COLLEGE EVERY WEEK OR NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY T. BREAKFAST WHERE THEY CAN BE A. A DEGREE OF INSECURITY SOME STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO DENY BECAUSE THE SIGMA ASSOCIATED WE HEAR THE WORDS HOMELESS OR EVEN IN SECURE. AND KNOW CITY WANTS TO BE STATISTICALLY TO BE CATEGORIZED AS SOMEONE WHO NEEDS EXTRA HELP. SO THE QUICK ACTIVITY I HAD THOUGHT I HAD A LITTLE MORE TIME BUT I WANT US ALL TO HEAR TO IMAGINE FOR A SECOND THAT WOULD HOMELESS ARE FOOD INSECURE STUDENT LOOKS LIKE. HOW DOES YOUR HAIR LOOK LIKE? WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES ARE THEY WEARING BUT THEY CAN'T ANY ITEMS WITH THEM? LOOK AROUND THE ROOM DO WE THINK ANYONE HERE TODAY FACE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THE REALITY IS THAT THE STUDENTS CAN LOOK LIKE ANYONE OF US HERE TODAY AND TO PROBABLY ADDRESSES ISSUES WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS WE HAVE ABOUT THESE POPULATIONS. IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT ALTHOUGH CD MAYBE WORKING IT'S STILL POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FACE SOME DEGREE OF FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. WE TELL STUDENTS THAT THEY MUST WORK TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK TO MEET THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF ATTENDING COLLEGE WE HAVE TO IMAGINE THE WORK ENVIRONMENTS OF THE STUDENTS ARE ENTERING. MOST STUDENTS HAVE INTERACTED WITH LIKE MYSELF WORK PART TIME JOBS AT RETAIL LOCATIONS MOVIE THEATERS ARE IN SOME FORM OF FAST FOOD SERVICE. YOU KNOW JUST THIS MONTH A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE TO STRUGGLING TO FIND AN EXTRA SOURCE OF INCOME. BUT TO HELP PAY FOR RENT BECAUSE HOURS WERE CUT THE TEN HOURS A WEEK SIMPLY DUE TO SOMETHING OUT OF HIS CONTROL LIKE LET SHOPPERS IN A PARKING. SO ANY LEVEL FOOD HOUSING OF SECURITY CAN BE A DETERMINING FACTOR WHETHER SOMEONE DECIDES TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND EVEN I AS YES PASSED AS THEY HAVE ABOUT THE PURSUIT OF LEARNING. WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CHOOSES THE SURVIVAL MYSELF MY FAMILY OVER MY PROCEED EDUCATION AND THESE ARE NOT DECISIONS THAT I THOUGHT STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE TO MAKING. AS AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO HELP EASE THE CITY LIFE EXPERIENCE. IN JUST TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN ASSEMBLY BILL THAT EXPANDED SHOWER FACILITIES TO HOMELESS YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. NOW I'M STILL AMAZED BY THE STUDENTS WHO TOOK EXTRA EFFORTS IN WHO ARE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR PERSONAL STORIES. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT COMMEND THOSE COLLEGES. WHO DID NOT LIMITED TO JUST HOMELESS STUDENTS BUT EXPANDED TO ALL THEIR SERVICES ALL THEIR STUDENTS IN GENERAL? SO HAVE YOU HERE HAVE AUTHORED LEGISLATION TACKLE THESE ISSUES AND WE DEFTLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE AS WELL. NEED SOME COLLEGES ARE ALSO DOING SOME GREAT WORK TO COMBAT THESE ISSUES LIKE CREATING FOOD PANTRIES AS MENTIONED EARLIER. ALLOWING THE DISBURSEMENT OF EMERGENCY GRANTS AND DEVELOPING LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS. TO EXPAND SERVICES OUTSIDE THE ROUTINE COLLEGE CAMPUS HOURS. WE HEAR STORIES OF AMAZING FOOD PANTRIES WHERE STUDENTS AND EVEN THEIR FAMILIES CAN COME IN AND TAKE POUNDS OF FRESH FRUIT THAT'S OFFERED TO THEM AT NO COST. SIMILAR STORIES ARE SHARED ABOUT HOW STUDENTS FACE THEN EMERGENCY WAS ABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL FUNDS QUICK ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. AND IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE HERE THAT THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS ARE LIMITED ESPECIALLY AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE WAYS COLLEGES ARE DRESSING THESE ISSUES IS A PARTING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS OUTSIDE OF THEIR SPECIFIC INSTITUTIONS. COLLEGES A PARTING WITH LOCAL FOOD BANKS TO STUDENTS CAN SHOP ON WEEKENDS A LOCAL CHURCHES TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SHOCK FACILITIES AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITH SELF WITH THE STUDENTS CAN HAVE OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. YOU DON'T EVEN OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AS KALI MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAD OUR FIRST EVER BASIC NEEDS SUMMIT JUST HERE LAST WEEK. AND WERE EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THAT GOES ON MOVING FORWARD. BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. YOU KNOW JUST DUE TO THE RECENCY OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN OUR SOMETIMES REACTIONARY. YOU KNOW SOME THESE INSTITUTIONS HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF RESOURCES LIKE TWO HUNDRED MEAL VOUCHERS AVAILABLE TO THEIR ENTIRE STUDENT POPULATION OF SOMETIMES TWENTY TO THIRTY THOUSAND. AND SOMETIMES SOME COLLEGES HAVE TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT STUDENTS HALF OF YOUR EFFORTS BY FACULTY MEMBER STAFF MEMBER STEVEN ACCESS THE SERVICES. AND ALTHOUGH WELL INTENTIONED THESE ARE NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WHO. ONE DON'T SELF IDENTIFY OR TWO DON'T EVEN KNOW THE FACE THESE INSECURITIES FOR THEMSELVES. AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE HOW HEARTBREAKING I MUST BE FOR FACULTY OR STAFF MEMBERS HAVE TO TURN AWAY STUDENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SERVICE IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. WE COULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN OUR APPROACH IF WE KNEW BUT MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. I TALK ABOUT THIS SOME EARLIER WHERE IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM WE UNDERSTAND OUT IN. THAT STUDENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH PROGRAM WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE FOR THAT STUDENT. AND WOULD A STUDENT LEAVES THAT INSTITUTION THE NEEDS OUT DISAPPEAR IT FOLLOWS THEM THROUGHOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOINING IF WE HAD SOME WAYS TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION ENTER INTO THE REACHING AGREEMENTS WE COULD DO MORE TO MEET THEIR STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE. LOCALLY WE MUST ALSO COMMUNICATE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES TO STUDENTS AT EVERY POINT OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY. YOU KNOW WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE AT LEAST I KNOW I CAN'T WE CAN AT LEAST PREPARE FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. WE COULD BE SHARING INFORMATION ORIENTATIONS AND CYCLOPS ROOMS USING STILL BY OFFERING WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE SEMESTER AND HOSTING EVENTS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE CRAMMING DURING FINALS. AND OVERALL I OPTIMISTICALLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT ALL OUR STUDENTS ARE SUCCESSFUL. AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT STUDENT SUCCESS MEANS TO YOU ARE US. WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT SOME STUDENTS CANNOT REALIZE A DREAM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WILL SLEEP TONIGHT OR WHETHER NEXT MEAL WILL BE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS MISTER. WITH MEDINA THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. I'VE I BELIEVE WAS YESTERDAY DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. WE HEARD. DIFFERENT. SUGGESTIONS AS YOU MENTION. MORE INFORMATION SHARED WITH STUDENTS AT EARLIER TIME PERHAPS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS YOU KNOW AS EARLY AS HIGH SCHOOL. ON THE DIFFICULTY OF THE MANEUVERING THROUGH. A THE NEEDS THAT THEY'RE GONNA FACE AS COLLEGE STUDENTS I THINK IN IN ALL THREE SYSTEMS. AND. AND THE AND I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND YOU KNOW ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT THREE SYSTEMS AND THE STUDENTS IN THOSE SYSTEMS. GREAT THANK THEIR VERY INNOVATIVE. AND THOUGHTFUL WAYS THAT THEY HAVE COME UP THEMSELVES. TO TACKLE THE THE VERY. SERIOUS ISSUES OF BOTH HOME AND FOOD INSECURITY. AND THEY ARE TO BE COMMENDED. FOR ALL THOSE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN. AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE INNOVATIVE. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS WHAT. CAN THE STATE DO. AND THE WHAT WHAT WHAT SUGGESTIONS DO YOU HAVE TO US. AS STATE LEGISLATORS TO TO. YOU KNOW TO FACE. THEY HISH ISSUE HEAD ON INTO. HOW? THE THREE SYSTEMS WITH THE WITH WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE I I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME. THAT THE SCHOOLS OF KIND OF BEEN THE SCHOOLS IN THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN. KIND OF. LEFT ALONE TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. SO MY QUESTION TO THE THREE OF YOU IS WHAT. SUGGESTIONS DO YOU HAVE FOR US. HOW CAN WE BETTER HELP THE STUDENTS? WITH THE ISSUES YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS IS ANY EFFORTS THAT CAN BE DONE TO STREAMLINE THE CAL FRESH APPLICATION PROCESS. AND. ENCOURAGING. COUNTY ACCOUNT FOR STAFF TO YOU KNOW PARTICIPATE AS ROBUSTLY AND THEY ARE PARTICIPATING QUITE ROBUSTLY IN IN PARTICULAR PLACES IN THE STATE BUT. I THINK ANY ENCOURAGEMENT OR ANY LEGISLATION THAT THAT SORT OF PUSHES TOWARD THAT. I'D DO STILL THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME ISSUES AROUND. COLLEGES ACCESSING LOCAL FOOD BANK RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THIS NONPROFIT ISSUE AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMEONE IN THE ROOM WHO. RACHEL FROM SWIPE WHO'S OFFERED TO HELP US TRIED TO GET SOME RESOLUTION ON THAT BUT YOU CAN TAKE UP TO TWO TWO YEARS TO GET THOSE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE IN SOME PLACES. BECAUSE OF THAT NONPROFIT ISSUE. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING CRISIS AND TO TRY TO DELVE INTO THAT BECAUSE I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY. THAT'S WHERE STUDENTS ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE FOR NON STOOD FOR AND ALL OF US RIGHT AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT STUDENTS. BUNKING UP EIGHT IN A IN A ONE OR TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT I THINK ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AROUND HOUSING IS WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL TO THE STUDENTS. THE MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES DON'T HAVE HOUSING YEAH ELEVEN OF THE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN HAVE LIMITED. DORMITORY OR OR CAMPUS BASED HOUSING. ANYONE ELSE YEAH. AT THE SUMMIT THE BASIC NEED SOME OF THAT WE ALL ATTENDED LAST WEEK. SOMEONE DISCUSS THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CASE THROUGH TWELVE. FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH OR FREE BREAKFAST PROGRAMS AND AT THE MOMENT THEY TURN EIGHTEEN AND MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THEY'RE CUT OFF FROM THAT. AND THERE ISN'T A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS TWO ONE HELP US IDENTIFY WHO MIGHT BE HIGH RISK. AND HAVING SOME WAY IN WHICH THAT WE CAN WOULD KNOW WHO THOSE STUDENTS ARE BECAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE STIGMA AROUND IT AND. AND THEIR NEW TO COLLEGE IN THE DON'T KNOW HOW THE SYSTEMS WORKS AND THEY HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING RESOURCES ANYWAY. JUST BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AMONG THE SYSTEMS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND. EXTENDING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AYE I THINK WOULD BE AN AMAZING STEP FORWARD. IT CERTAINLY WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HAVING THEM AT LEAST BE FED ONCE A DAY. ON I HAD A STUDENT WHO CAME TO ME YESTERDAY WHO WAS ONE OF OUR STUDENT LEADERS A YEAR AGO. WHO KEPT TELLING HIM HE DID LOOK OKAY AND I KEPT ASKING HIM IT WAS SUPER EMBARRASSED BY THE SOLEMN COUCH SURFING I'M FINE? THIRD TIME THIS SEMESTER I SAW HIM WITH HIS SUITCASE AND HE'D LOST LIKE TWENTY POUNDS HE STUCK SKIN AND BONES. AND UNLIKE OUR AGAIN IN MY OFFICE WHAT IS GOING ON IS A POINT IN ONE ANYBODY TO KNOW. I WAS LIKE OKAY I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU DON'T TELL ME AND WE WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW AS A AS A HUNTER MENTIONS THERE'S YOU KNOW WE. CONNECTING TO AN EMERGENCY LOAN WE CONNECT HIM TO THE FLAVOR PROGRAM TO GET HIM SOME FOOD VOUCHERS WE GET HIM SOME FOOD OUT OF THE CLOSET. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HOPE LONG TERM WE NEED WE NEED SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP US GET THERE. IT YOU KNOW HOUSING SOLUTIONS RIGHT YOU BEING IN SANTA MONICA YOU KNOW HEAR TONS OF STORIES OF STUDENTS WHO WERE LIVING IN ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS WITH EIGHT OR TWELVE PEOPLE. AND THEY TAKE SHIFTS SLEEPING. IT'S WERE IN A REALLY UNSUSTAINABLE. CONTEXT RIGHT NOW NATIONWIDE BUT PARTICULARLY THINK CALIFORNIA AND AND ENDS. IS IT IS REALLY SUFFERING. AND AND I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK THIS PROBLEMS BUT HER A LOT LONGER THAN. ANYONE WAS GIVING IT AIR. SO. YEAH IF I SUGGESTIONS. YEAH AT LIKE TO JUST TOUCH UPON A LITTLE BIT OF THE COMMENTS ARE MADE EARLIER. YES SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT OUR COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE OUTLINES. YOU KNOW THE HOUSING CRISIS IS A HUGE IMPACT FOR IN ALL VERSIONS ACROSS OUR SEGMENTS IN WITH ME. WHEN WE SPEAK TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TOO FAMILIAR WITH WHAT A COMMUNICATIVE IN IS THERE. YOU KNOW HOW TO MANEUVER THROUGH THE SYSTEM YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THINK THEY LIVE AT HOME RIGHT LIVE WITH THEIR PARENTS. SOME OF THE ONLY ONES THAT WHEN WE PARTNER WITH THIS USE USER UC'S TO OFFER YOU KNOW HOUSING I TOLD THEM YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ALREADY IMPACTED BY THEIR INSTITUTIONS ITSELF. SO HOUSING CRISIS IS A HUGE ONE THAT IMPACTS LOT OF STUDENTS. KNOW TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND STUDENTS LIVING IN THEIR CARS ABOUT IF WE HAVE NO MEANINGFUL. YOU KNOW IMPACT IF YOU HAVE NO MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION TOWARDS AT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO FOR OUR STUDENTS BESIDES TELLING HIM TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AND THEN EXPANDING YOU KNOW CAL FRESH AYE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT EXPANDING YOU KNOW ANYTHING TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO BOTH APPLY INSTITUTIONS TO. TO RECOMMEND THOSE APPLICATIONS CAN DO A LOT. IT THERE'S THERE'S LESS OF A CIGAR AROUND YOU KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF OF CAL FRESH RAIN IN THE COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I'VE SEEN. OF STUDENTS ARE MORE COURAGE NOW ESPECIALLY MY COLLEGE TO APPLY AND TO UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES THAT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD WHO CAN DEFTLY TAKE SOME MORE STEPS TO. IMPROVE IN THAT ACCESS TO A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS. DOUBLE DUTCH IS NOT SHARED WITH INSTITUTIONS ARE OUR SYSTEMS ABOUT SOME STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY HIGH RISK INDICATORS TELL SYSTEM. SO WE HAD AWAY AS A CALLING MENTION TO IDENTIFY THOSE STUDENTS A LITTLE EARLIER AND FIND THOSE POTENTIAL HIGH RISK STUDENTS WE CAN ADJUST THEM SPECIFICALLY. AS ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS IS COMMUNICATING TO STUDENTS ABOUT THE SERVICES. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS CASTING A WIDE NET BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW WHO THE STUDENTS ARE. WITH LIMITED RESOURCES WE CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH TALKING US THIS AND AND THEY'RE AN AREA OR POPULATION CAN DO A LOT MORE GOOD. YEAH. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WOULD HEAR FROM THE NEXT PANEL LEE MAYBES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU LATER ON BUT LAW TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO THE SECOND PANEL WHICH DEALS WITH THE C. ISSUE SYSTEM. AND. WE HAVE THREE INDIVIDUALS HERE DOCTOR BEV DID NIECE BEVERLY WAS A DIRECTIVE STUDENT WELLNESS AND BASIC NEEDS. AND WE HAVE THE OXYGEN MCGUIRE WHOSE. FESTIVE HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY AND MAGGIE Y. WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. OKAY. THANKS. PEOPLE LIKE WE DON'T HAVE TO. OR ANYTHING. OKAY. SO ONE OF THE POWER POINT WE DO. OKAY NOW IT'S UP TO YOU. THIS STEP IS HERE. THERE WAS NO REDUCTIVE BEVERLY. THANK YOU. PRESIDENT CHEN MY NAME IS DENISE BEVERLY I'M THE DIRECTOR OF STUDENT WELLNESS AND BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE. AT THE CSU TO START I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. AND YOU LEGISLATIVE CA HOW COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF OUR EFFORTS TO HELP ME. BASIC NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED BY THE BUDGET ACT. TWENTY SEVENTEEN I TO THE CSU HAS BEEN DISPERSED ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. TO HELP THEM BECOME DESIGNATED AS HUNGER FREE. WE USED A RFP PROCESS IN WHICH CAMPUSES COULD APPLY FOR DOLLARS IN THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. BEING REQUIRED ACTIVITIES ENCOURAGED ACTIVITIES AND INNOVATIVE ACTIVITIES SO THESE FUNDS WILL BE CRITICAL IN HELPING OUR CAMPUSES DEVELOP IMPLEMENT. AND ENHANCE RESOURCES TO FOOD INSECURITY IN HOUSING DISPLACEMENT. THANK YOU. OUR COMMITMENT TO CSU STUDENTS ENTER ACADEMIC IN FUTURE SUCCESS NECESSITATES A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING THEIR BASIC NEEDS WINSTON'S BASIC NEEDS ARE NOT A DRASTIC IMPACT BOTH THEIR PERSONAL AND ACADEMIC GROWTH. IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO TO TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND EARNED A DEGREE. THAT IS WHITE STUDENT WELL BEING AS A PRIORITY ON OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS YES USE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER. POSITIVELY IMPACTING THEIR FUTURE AND PRODUCING ADDITIONAL GRADUATES TO POWER CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND INNOVATION. FIFTY S. USE BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE IS A SYSTEM WIDE EFFORT TO COORDINATE SERVICES AROUND CAMPUS IS HELPING THEM REACH ALL STUDENTS IN NEED OF SUPPORT. THEN MISSION OF THE STRUCTURE AROUND FIVE KEY AREAS ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF STUDENTS GROWING CAMPUS SPACE. BASIC NEEDS SERVICES SO THEY CAN REACH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS SCALING BEST PRACTICES FROM ONE CAMPUS TO ACROSS THE SYSTEM WORKING WITH PARTNERS LOCALLY STATEWIDE IN FEDERALLY. AND ENSURING LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF BASIC NEEDS SERVICE SAYS. THE CSU CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK LINKING STUDENTS TO THAT ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY HOUSING DISPLACEMENT. AND HOMELESSNESS. SO TO START OFF WITH A DRESSING. FOOD INSECURITY MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR CAMPUSES EITHER OT SOME SORT OF FOOD DISTRIBUTION OUR FOOD PANTRY PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE OUR CAMPUSES THAT ARE DOING CALTRANS APPLICATION ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS MEALS SHARING OF VOUCHERS PROGRAMS IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN DONATE TO OTHER STUDENTS. SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES ALSO HAVE GARDEN PROGRAMS IN WHICH STUDENTS ARE TAUGHT HOW TO. GROW THEIR OWN FOOD WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH CAMPUS IS TO GET AB T. ON CAMPUS. AND THEN ALSO NOTIFICATION SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE AN APP THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO LET STUDENTS KNOW WHEN THERE IS LEFT OVER FOOD FROM AN EVENT. OUR ON CAMPUS SO THAT HAD THEY HAD ACCESS TO A MEAL. CSU CAMPUSES ARE ALSO PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF OUR CAMPUSES OFFER ON CAMPUS EMERGENCY HOUSING OR VOUCHERS FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE AT CSU CHICO STAFF PROVIDE STUDENTS FACING I'M. FACING HOMELESSNESS AND A HOUSING EMERGENCY VOUCHER HOTEL VOUCHER TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM RELIEF AND THE CAMPUS WILL SERVE AS A CO SIGNER ON LEASE AGREEMENTS TO HELP STUDENTS TRANSITION INTO LONG TERM HOUSING. SIMILARLY CSU NORTHRIDGE WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS TO HELP STUDENTS GROW. IN NEED TO PROCURE HOUSING. SEE IF YOU CANVASES ALSO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS IN NEED MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF OUR CSU STUDENTS RECEIVE SOME FORM OF NON LOAN AID. BUT BEYOND FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAMPUSES ALSO OFFER EMERGENCY GRANTS OR FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE SAN JOSE STATE OFFERS EMERGENCY GRANTS FOR STUDENTS. THAT THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPAY SANTA SACRAMENTO STATE ALSO OFFERS EMERGENCY GRANTS AND HOST FINANCIAL LITERACY WORKSHOPS TO TEACH STUDENTS ABOUT MONEY MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING. WE ARE PROUD OF THE VISION OUR CAMPUSES HAVE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS HAD ON AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE ALSO KNOW THERE IS MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE ALLIES TO HELP TO HELP US ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO TEN. YEAH. AND I'M NOT SURE. AT THE BOTTOM LINE RIGHT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAMPUS CLIMATE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. ABOUT A BASIC NEEDS RESEARCH IN THE CSU AND PROGRAMMING AT MY HOME CAMPUS HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY. AND DOCTOR CHEN REQUIREMENTS ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL WORK AT HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY. AND COKIE I FOR THE CSU STUDY OF STUDENT BASIC. DOCTOR RASHEEDA CRUTCHFIELD ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIAL WORK AT LONG BEACH STATE. FIRST ON THE TALK ABOUT THE STUDY AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT EACH ISSUE PROGRAMMING. THE STUDY WAS COMMISSIONED BY CSU CHANCELLOR TIMOTHY WHITE AND IS PART OF THE CSU BASIC NEEDS INITIATIVE. THIS IS THE SECOND PHASE OF A THREE PART STUDY FINDINGS WERE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. FACE TO WITH THE SYSTEM WIDE MIXED METHOD STUDY THAT DESCRIBE THE PREVALENCE HEALTH FACTORS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND EXPERIENCES OF CSU STUDENT WITH HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD INSECURITY. OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS ON ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES COMPLETED SURVEYS AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN STUDENTS ON ELEVEN CAMPUSES. PARTICIPATED IN INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS AND FALL TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN SPRING TWENTY SEVENTEEN. DOCTOR CRUTCHFIELD ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTING DATA ON FEES THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT BASIC NEEDS SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TAKING PLACE IN THE CSU. AND WE ANTICIPATE THIS REPORT TO BE RELEASED. IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. GROUPS. THERE WE GO. OKAY. IN THE CSU WE FOUND THAT FORTY ONE POINT SIX PERCENT OF STUDENTS EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY IN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS. TIFFANY FROM LONG BEACH THE SHARED ABOUT WHAT'S VERY LOW FOOD SECURITY WAS LIKE FOR HER. SHE SAID SO BASICALLY WHAT I USED TO DO WITH THE THREE DAYS OUT OF THE WEEK IT WAS LIKE MINUTE MAID AND SHIPS AND ALBEIT. I WOULD NEED ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY. SHE DID THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALSO BUT BACK THEN SHE HAD QUALIFIED FOR FREE LUNCH THESE ISSUES DON'T JUST STOP WHEN YOU GRADUATEFROM HIGH SCHOOL. TIFFANY WAS NOT AN HOUR LATER AND WE HEARD THIS TYPE OF STORY MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT OUR RESEARCH. IN THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT NEARLY ELEVEN PERCENT OF CSU STUDENTS REPORTED BEING HOMELESS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ONE ON. ONE OR MORE TIMES. WELL IS A BIT FROM FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY SHARED ABOUT HER EXPERIENCE WITH HOMELESSNESS. AND SO ENDED UP BEING HOMELESS FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS SLEEPING ON FRIENDS COUCHES AND STAYING IN MY CAR. ELIZABETH HAD BUDGETED JUST FINE FOR THE YEAR BUT SHE WAS EVICTED TO GET COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVELY HIGHER RENTAL RATES SHOULD IN BUDGET FOR A NEW DEPOSIT. AND THE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT AND SHE ENDED UP HAVING TO LEAVE SCHOOL. RELATED TO ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WE FOUND THAT THE MORE FOOD INSECURE OR HIGHER THE INCIDENCE OF HOMELESSNESS A STUDENT EXPERIENCE THE LOWER THE REPORTED GPA. AND THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF ACADEMIC CONCERNS. SUCH AS WORRY ABOUT GRADES AND TEST TAKING TROUBLE CONCENTRATING TIME MANAGEMENT AMONG OTHER THINGS. FOR THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS WE FOUND THE MORE FOOD INSECURE AND THE MORE. A STUDENT WAS HOMELESS THE MORE SYMPTOMS OF POOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH EXPRIENCE THE LAST THIRTY DAYS. AND THE MORE DAYS MISSED OF SCHOOL OR WORK. STUDENTS MISS NEARLY DOUBLE DOUBLE OR NEARLY DOUBLE THE DAYS WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR PEERS WHOSE BASIC NEEDS ARE BEING MET. WE HEARD A LOT OF PUSH BACK ABOUT HOW STUDENTS FACE FOOD INSECURITY IN HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE SO WE ASK STUDENTS ABOUT WHY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY GROCERIES. WE ASKED ABOUT SPENDING HABITS SUCH AS BUYING ALCOHOL EATING OUT GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS AS WELL AS QUESTIONS ABOUT BUDGETING AND CONFUSION WITH PAYING BILLS. I KNOW SOME STUDENTS DID STRUGGLE WITH BUDGETING ISSUES NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT OVERWHELMINGLY WE FOUND THAT MOST STUDENTS OVER SEVENTY PERCENT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY GROCERIES BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AND THIS MAKES SENSE BECAUSE ON AVERAGE WE KNOW THAT A PUBLIC FOUR YEAR DEGREE COST TWELVE THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN A FULL FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE INCLUDING LOANS. WHEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY OFTEN BASIC NEEDS ARE THE FIRST TO GO. SO CAL FRESHMAN CAMPUS EMERGENCY FOR FOOD PANTRY INCREASE FOOD PANTRY USE INCREASE WHEN STUDENTS REPORTED LOAN VERY LOW. FOOD INSECURITY HOWEVER UTILIZATION IS WERE STILL VERY LOW AT THE TIME A DATA COLLECTION. AND WE EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW THAT HOW FRESH THE TREMENDOUS SUPPORT WHICH IS CLEAR IN THE DATA AND ALSO IN THE WORDS OF STUDENT FIONA WHO SHARED HOW MUCH IT REALLY MATTERS. SHE SAID I DON'T REMEMBER HOW MUCH I GOT THIS MONTH BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY SEMESTER IN COLLEGE OF EVER MADE THE DEAN'S LIST. I WAS GETTING HEALTHY FOOD AND I THINK ABOUT MONEY PROBLEMS OBVIOUSLY CONSUMES YOU. IF I WAS GETTING ENOUGH NUTRITION I WAS GETTING ENERGY I WAS AWAKEN EATEN BREAKFAST EVERY MORNING CAO FRESH MADE A DIFFERENCE. SO RESPONDING TO STUDENTS WHO ARE HOUSING IN FOOD INSECURE WILL REQUIRE COMPLEX AND LONG TERM APPROACHES APPROACHES IN SOLUTION BUILDING. HOPE YOU TAKE TIME TO REVIEW THE PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WE STARTED WITH THE GOAL OF INCREASING FOOD SECURITY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STEP O. SNATCHED IN FOOD PROGRAMS EMERGENCY FOOD INITIATIVES WITH AN EYE ON FOOD RECOVERING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. HOWEVER MANY STUDENTS SHOWED UP THE TIME THAT THAT WAS NOT THEIR ONLY BE SICK NEED. THEY'RE ALL THAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING TO ME. HUMBOLDT COUNTY IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING HIT HARD NINETEEN PERCENT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST YEAR. BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE A MAJOR HOUSING SHORTAGE IN OUR AREA WHICH KEEPS RENT PRICES HIGH. STUDENTS WITH ANY DISADVANTAGES ARE PUSHED OUT OF THE MARKET. ONE OF OUR NEWEST AND MOST INNOVATIVE INITIATIVES AS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AREA ONE AGENCY ON AGING CALLED THE NEST A HOME SHARING LIVING ARRANGEMENT. THIS IS WHERE A THIRD PARTY OFFER SUPPORT TO RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS BY WAY OF MATCHING. IT PROVIDE INFORMATIONAL BOOKLETS MEETINGS WORKSHOPS AND REFERRALS TO SERVICES THIS IS WHERE STUDENTS CAN DO WORK IN EXCHANGE FOR CHEAPER RENT CREATING AFFORDABLE LIVING OPTIONS FOR BOTH SENIORS AND STUDENTS. ANOTHER PROGRAM WATCH THIS YEAR TRAIN STAFF AND FACULTY AS WELL BEING AMBASSADORS. TO LEARN ABOUT RESOURCES THAT CAN GUIDE STUDENTS MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES WHICH WE KNOW ARE MUCH MORE PREVALENT AMONG STUDENTS WHO ARE FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURE. MORE THAN HALF OUR STUDENTS COME TO EACH ISSUE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE AND. SURE IS A COLLECTION OF SERVICES THAT HELPS EACH ISSUE STUDENTS NAVIGATE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND SIGN UP FOR INSURANCE INCLUDING MEDI CAL. AND THE PEER EDUCATORS THAT WORK IN THE FOOD PANTRY ARE HELPING TO. IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH MANY PARTNERS TO HELP STUDENTS MEET THEIR IMMEDIATE BASIC NEEDS CONTINUED FUNDING OF THE CALIFORNIA HUNGER FREE CAMPUS BILL HELPS US DO THAT. AGES YOU FUNDS FROM THE BILL ARE SUPPORTING FOOD AN INFASTRUCTURE FOR OH SNAP AND THE LAUNCH OF A THRIFT STORE AND FURNITURE SLOP. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM OF RESOURCES MANY STUDENTS NEARLY HALF CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR COLLEGE DEGREE AND LIVING EXPENSES ON THEIR CURRENT BUDGETS. AND GENERAL THESE ARE NOT PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR FROM POOR DECISION MAKING THESE ARE PROBLEMS OF A BROKEN SYSTEM AND WE NEED POLICY SOLUTIONS. THAT AIM TO IDENTIFY AN INCREASE STUDENT ASSETS SUCH AS PELL AND WORK STUDY AND FIND WAYS TO OFFER HEALTHY FOOD AND SAFE HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THAT IS WHY WE'RE COMING TO YOU HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO MOVE BEYOND PATCHING THE PROBLEM AND WORK TOWARDS STRATEGICALLY IDENTIFYING. CURRENT AND DEVELOPING NEW INITIATIVES THAT WILL INCREASE STUDENT SAFETY AND HEALTH BY CAL FRESH. AGAIN I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT GRATITUDE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON CAMPUS CLIMATE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. THANK YOU. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON AND TEAR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MATTHEW I AM A GRADUATE STUDENT AT CSU STANISLAUS AND SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOUSE SEATS UNION SAYS SHE A CHEN WHICH REPRESENTS ALL STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING EVERYONE FOR THEIR WORK TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF CAMPUS CLIMATE AND PARTICULARLY BASIC NEEDS. OUR STUDENTS ARE GREATLY IMPACTED BY OUR EFFORTS AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON A DAILY BASIS ABOUT EQUITABLE STUDENT SUCCESS. BEFORE DIVING INTO THE TOPIC OF BASIC MEANS I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT PART OF TOUCH CAMPUS CLIMATE. RECENT ACTS OF RACISM AND PREJUDICE ON CSU CAMPUSES HAVE REVEALED PUBLICLY WHAT STUDENTS OF COLORHAVE LONG EXPERIENCE IN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY. AND ALTHOUGH THESE INCIDENTS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO THE CSU SYSTEM. THEY DEMONSTRATE OUR CAMPUSES ARE NOT IMMUNE TO THE CHALLENGES OF SYSTEMIC RACISM TO ENDANGER THE SAFETY AND INCLUSION OF STUDENTS AT OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES AND SPECIFICALLY STUDENTS OF COLOR. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CSU STUDENT HEALTH WELLNESS AND SAFETY REPORT. THREATS ALLOW THIS AND SAFETY ARE MOST PREVALENT AMONG STUDENTS OF COLOR. INCIDENTS AT THERE'S A CALL SALT ON NON WHITE STUDENTS WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS THEIR WHITE STUDENT COUNTERPARTS. AND STUDENTS OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT BEING VERBALLY THREATENED AND FEELING THAT DISCRIMINATION IMPEDED THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE CSU SYSTEM LEADS THE NATION IN MANY WAYS OF WHAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE PROUD. WE SHOULD ALSO LEAD IN ADDRESSING INEQUITIES CAUSED BY SYSTEMIC RACISM ON OUR CAMPUSES. SO THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. AND QUALITY CANNOT EXIST WHILE ANY STATE STUDENT AS STEREOTYPES ARE TARGETED BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE. FACING RACISM PREJUDICE AND IGNORANCE IN OUR SOCIETY LET ALONE IN OUR PLACES OF LEARNING HAS OBVIOUS INEQUITABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE ALSO SEE THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOU. FACE DISPROPORTIONATE BARRIERS WHEN IT COMES TO STUDENT HOUSING AND SECURITY. ACCORDING TO THIS YES USE BASIC NEEDS ARE PART RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AS YOU'VE HEARD WHILE SYSTEM WIDE WHILE FORTY ONE POINT SIX PERCENT OF STUDENTS REPORT SOME FORM OF FOOD INSECURITY SIXTY FIVE POINT NINE PERCENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS REPORT SOME FORM OF FOOD INSECURITY. AMONG OUR STUDENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS UNDERSERVED THEIR RATES OF FOOD INSECURITY OR MEAN HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE. THIS MEANS AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE WORK MUST BE DONE INTENTIONALLY AND WITH THE STATE'S DEDICATION TO EQUITY AT THE FOREFRONT. UNFORTUNATELY FAR TOO MANY OF OUR CSU STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS. TEN POINT NINE PERCENT OF STUDENTS SYSTEM WINE THAT'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS. REPORTED BEING HOMELESS SOMETIME WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. AND AGAIN OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS REPORTED HIGHER THAN AVERAGE NUMBERS EIGHTEEN PERCENT. I PROBABLY DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU'RE HOMELESS TURNING IN THAT PAPER ON TIME ATTENDING CLASS PARTICIPATING HIGH IMPACT PRACTICES IS PROBABLY THE LAST THING ON YOUR MIND. WE APPRECIATE THE PASSIONATE WORK OF MANY LEGISLATORS WHO RECOGNIZE THE SEVERITY OF BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITIES ON OUR CAMPUS SAYS. FOR EXAMPLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COPIERS AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOR THE EMERGENCY STUDENT HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM WOULD CREATE A PILOT RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM FOR THREE YEARS AT THREE CSU CAMPUSES. TO ASSIST STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT HOMELESSNESS PROBLEMS. WE KNOW THAT MANY STUDENTS WHO BONTA HOMELESSNESS DO SO BECAUSE A SHORT TERM FINANCIAL EMERGENCY. GIVING THESE INDIVIDUAL SHORT TERM FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THIS CASE RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS. WE'LL PUT THEM IN A POSITION TO BECOME FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT AGAIN I TAKE ON THE COST OF THEIR LIVING SITUATION AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE. THIS TAKES US THE LAST IF SHE DAHLE BE MENTIONING TODAY MENTAL HEALTH. ALL THESE ISSUES SEEM TO RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING HOUSING YOU'RE PROBABLY STRUGGLING TO FEED YOURSELF AS WELL. AND IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND OUR FOOD AND SECURITY YOU WANT OUT OF WE HAVE STRUGGLED WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES TO. THE DIFFICULTY OF THEIR STUDIES THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IN THE NATIONAL CLIMATE. INTERPERSONAL ISSUES WITH FAMILY FRIENDS ARMY ANTIC PARTNERS. THESE FACTORS ARE ALL LINKED AND LAYERED. STUDENTS HAVE WORKED HARD FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS TO TRY TO EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON OUR CAMPUSES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH. WE KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS IS ONE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR PER FIFTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. HOWEVER ONLY THIRTEEN NUMBER TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE ANYTHING CLOSE TO YOU OR UNDER THAT RANGE. AND AT SOME CAMPUSES THERE YOU SEE THE RATIO IS MUCH HIGHER. AT FRESNO STATE SAN FRANCISCO STEAK HOUSE DE LA THE RATIOS ONE COUNSELOR TO MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS SO TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THESE RATIOS MEAN ON MANY CAMPUSES TO DEAL WITH THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS STUDENTS ARE PART WAIT TIMES OF UP TO A MONTH TO SEE A COUNSELOR IN PERSON AND A CAP ON THEIR VISITS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. NO STUDENT WHEN THEY FOUND THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG AND HAVE SUCH A LACK OF ACCESS THE HELP THEY NEED TO BE SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL ON THEIR CAMPUS. LASTLY ON THIS TOPIC ON ALL CAMPUSES STUDENT FEES ARE BEING USED TO PAY FOR THESE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE SAYS. THIS MEANS THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO EXPAND THESE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS IS TO INCREASE THESE CAMPUS BASED FEES. BUT THIS ONLY COMPOUNDS THE CYCLE OF AFFORDABILITY MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH FOOD COSTS HOUSING COSTS AND TUITION AND CAMPUS BASED VIEW THAT CONTINUE TO RISE. IF THE ONLY SOLUTION WITH RESPECT MENTAL HEALTH IS TO EXACERBATE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT TRULY HELP STUDENTS. GREAT WORK IS BEING DONE ON MANY OF OUR CAMPUSES TO ADDRESS STUDENT HOUSING AND SECURITY. FROM ONSITE FOOD PANTRIES WORKING WORKSHOPS TEACHING STUDENTS HOW TO SIGN UP FOR CAL FRESH BENEFITS AND APPS THAT ALERT STUDENTS FOR THEIR LEFTOVERS FROM CATERED EVENTS ON CAMPUS. CSU CAMPUSES ARE TAKEN UP THE CHALLENGE OF MEETING STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS SO THEY CAN EXILE. AND I BELIEVE THEY'RE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. STILL THERE IS WORK LEFT TO DO AND IT MUST BE DONE WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WITH THE MOST NEED ORGAN SOLID FOUNDATION TO SUCCEED. I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR ALLOWING IS HERE TODAY FOR WORKING HARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF EQUITY IN STUDENT SUCCESS AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE. ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE INTERTWINED I FEEL PRIVILEGED TO WORK ALONGSIDE ALL OF YOU AND TRYING TO SOLVE THESE ISSUES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STAY IN INSTITUTIONAL LEADERS THINK OF US OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU RIPLEY'S WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ITEMIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE QUESTIONS JUST COMMENTS I KNOW THAT YESTERDAY WE HAD A SOMEWHAT OF A BRIEFING ON SOME OF THE WORK THE CAL STATE IS DOING IN LAST WEEK. I WAS AT CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS AND TALKING TO STUDENTS THERE ABOUT SOME OF THE BASIC NEEDS AND. IT WAS INSPIRED TO HEAR SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE IDEAS THAT I THINK ARE COMING. A FORWARD A PARTICULAR AROUND TEMPORARY HOUSING OPTIONS THAT THE HOUSE OF THE CAMPUSES ARE PROVIDING AND SO THAT WAS A REALLY. GOOD TO HEAR ON PARTICULAR AS I HEARD FROM A STUDENT TO LAUGH TALKS ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE HOMELESS AND HAVE TO SLEEP IN YOUR CAR AND HOW THAT'S CONSIDERED A CRIME IN A LOT OF THE CITIES. NEAR THE UNIVERSITY SO I THINK YOU. WANT TO THANK YOU. I'D WE'VE GOT YOUR LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS WE. AS WE DO IT APPEARED KIND OF A COSTLY FINDING OURSELVES GOING THROUGH THE VARIOUS BE AREAS THAT EXIST OF THE THAT WE CAN LEGISLATIVELY REMOVED. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE CAMPUSES TO WRESTLE WITH THE ISSUES. WE DID DO SOME FUNDING LAST YEAR I'M NOT SURE IF WE'LL BE DOING I HOPE WILL BE DOING SOME THIS YEAR AGAIN. AS AN INCENTIVE TO THE CAMPUSES TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF OF FOOD INSECURITY AND AND HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE WE WE DELIVERED UP HERE OF COURSE WE HAVE. SERIOUS ISSUES OF HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COST OF HOUSING AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO IT'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN AND. SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT STUDENTS BECAUSE WE THINK OF THEY ALL LIVE IN THE DORM WHICH IS NOT TRUE AND SO AS A RESULT THAT MAKES IT THAT WE HAVE TO BREAK DOWN THAT. THAT THAT CYCLE OF THINKING ESPECIALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO DORMITORIES THAT'LL SOME OF YOUR CAMPUSES HAVE. THE C. ISSUE I HAVE HAVE SET ASIDE ROOMS IN THE DORM TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SO YOU HAVE AT LEAST ACCESS TO THAT ISSUE THAT SEVERE. IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TO DO THAT. OF SOMETIMES I SEE ISSUE IN UC'S HAVE A FEW MORE RESOURCES THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THOSE CAMPUSES. AND THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT THE FOUR YEAR COLLEGE VERSUS THE TWO YEAR COLLEGE WITH REGARDS TO HOUSING IN FUNDING IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND I THINK WE'LL NEED TO START LOOKING AT THAT MORE CAREFULLY INTO A PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF THE GRANTS THAT WE GIVE ALL WE ASSUME IT'S CHEAPER TO GO TO A COMMUNICABLE IT. AND TECHNICALLY IT IS IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT. WHAT THE FEES AND AND BOOKS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO OFTENTIMES LIVE? AND. AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OUR DORMITORIES A CHEAPER THAN APARTMENTS AND. IT WAS TO GET FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS VERSUS THE TWO SO. WHAT WE'RE BUT WE'VE WHERE WHERE THAT THE AT THIS LEVEL WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO? HOW TO RESPOND TO IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE OF BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES THE IMAGES WE HAVE? DICTATE POLICIES THAT THAT ARE NOT BENEFICIAL AND SO. WILL BEEN PLEASE WITH YOU WITH THAT SO THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE STUDY THAT WAS DONE YES. AND CAN I JUST MENTION ONE THING JUST TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK OFF WHAT I'M CALLING SIDE FROM THE CCC IS ABOUT CAL FRESH. IF THERE IS A WAY TO EVEN EXPAND THE RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM TO COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT BE WONDERFUL TO CONSIDER AND THEN ALSO THE EBT APPLICATION FOR CAMPUS IT'S BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE APPLICATION IS NOT SET FOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES. AND IT THERE'S INFORMATION THAT'S BEING ASKED ON THERE THAT'S VERY HARD FOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO. ADDRESS SO IF THERE IS A WAY THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EITHER MAKE THAT. APPLICATION. A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUSED FOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THAT MORE OF OUR CAMPUSES CAN'T APPLY AND GET APPROVED THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL. OKAY WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE APPLICATION FOR CAO FRESH IS NOT BEEN IS NOT TAILORED FOR STUDENT RIGHT IT'S FOR RETAILERS. THAT IF JEFFREY BT I'M SORRY CARVE OUT FOR EDT IT'S FOR YOU KNOW RETAILERS CORNER STORE IT'S MARKETS. AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ON THERE IS LIKE WHAT KIND OF RETAILER ARE YOU OR YOUR SOLE PROPRIETOR ARE YOU. AND SO OUR CAMPUSES DON'T NECESSARILY FALL INTO THAT SO THERE'S BEEN SOME CAN SOME CONFUSION A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION AROUND THAT. AND THEN THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ASK FOR A PERSON SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND DRIVERS LICENSE SO THAT MEANS SOMEONE ON OUR CAMPUS HAS TO DO TO DO THAT OR GIVE THAT INFORMATION AND IT. SO MAYBE IF THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY ON THE APPLICATION SO THAT IT OPENS IT UP MORE BECAUSE IF WE'RE ENCOURAGING OUR STUDENTS FOR CAL TRASH. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OFF CAMPUS TO USE THOSE DOLLARS. YOU NOTE SOMETIMES THAT THE BARRIERS WELL ESPECIALLY MORE RULE COMMUNITIES WHERE MAYBE THERE'S NOT A STORE THAT'S NEARBY MAYBE ONLY HAVE AN HOUR IN BETWEEN CLASS. SO JUST THINKING ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AND FOCUS ON THEIR SCHOOL WORK. DON'T SOME OF YOU CAMPUS IS YOU HAVE EBT CARDS YEAH WE HAVE SIX CAMPUSES THAT OFFER EBT ON CAMPUS OKAY AND THE OTHERS DON'T BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE EITHER THE APPLICATION IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH OR THERE'S QUESTIONS AROUND AT SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE APPLIED AND IT'S. A PROCESS WHERE THEY HAVE THEY MAKE IT DENIED FOR SOME REASON AND THEN THEY HAVE TO APPLY AGAIN I BELIEVE IF YOU'RE DENIED. ARE NOT APPROVED TWICE YOU HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE YOU CAN APPLY AND. SO EVEN HAVE ANY CONNECTION I'M WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THAT CONNECTION NOW BUT TO HAVE A CONNECTION TO SOMEONE. WITHIN THE U. S. C. A. TO HELP COLLEGE CAMPUSES SPECIFICALLY YEAH LIAISON TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL WILL LOOK INTO THAT YEAH BECAUSE I KNOW WE. EBT CARDS HAVE BEEN A BIG ISSUE APPEAR WITH THAT WITH REGARD TO THAT AND AND GETTING THE LEGISLATION THROUGH. TO MAKE SURE THE CAMPUSES CAN. THEY CAN GET THE CAN USE EBT CARDS ON CAMPUS FIRST OF ALL THAT WAS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. AND THEN. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE CAL FRESH IN THEIR COUNTIES OF THE STUDENTS ON THE CAMPUSES CAN STILL APPLY. MACAU FIRST BECAUSE IT THAT COVERED BY THE STATE SO WE'VE DONE SOME OF THOSE THINGS WILL HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING AS YOU FIND BE AREAS LET US KNOW BECAUSE THAT. OFTENTIMES MAKE IS GOING TO ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE THINK WE'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S MISSING OR GLITCHES SOMETHING. WE CAN TRY TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE. WITH THE WITH THE PEOPLE WHO DEAL WITH IT AND AND AND LET THEM KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE APPLICATION. OF AND HOW LONG IT TAKES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO. NOW WILL LOOK INTO THAT WILL LOOK INTO THAT MADE AND I CAN FOLLOW UP I CONTINUED YEAH FOLLOW UP WITH THAT WITH MY STAFF ON THAT BECAUSE WE. YOU KNOW AT ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED ABOUT THE THIS ISSUE IS THAT OUT. EVERYTHING LOOKS UP WAS NOT. THAT'S REAL CLEAR AND. AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU CAN SEE THE FOOD ON THE TABLE BUT YOU CAN GET THERE TO GET IT. AND SO THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. NOTED PARTICULAR IN THIS STATE SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT IT WOULD NOT DESIGNED FOR. MOST CAMPUSES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO. WE'RE MOVING SLOWLY BUT SURELY TO ADDRESS THOSE SOLD WILL BE IN TEXAS HE WILL WE NEED TO DO TO BASICALLY MAKE THAT APPLICATION PROCESS. EASIER AND A MORE OPEN AND FASTER IN TERMS OF PROCESSING. AS WELL AS A OF THE RESTAURANT MEALS PROGRAM AS IT SHOULD BE AT EVERY CAMPUS YES OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S HEAR FROM MY UC CAMPUS. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY OF FROM ARE YOU SEE CAMPUS WE HAVE REUBEN COULD NATO FLU IS THAT THE. YOU SEE SYSTEMS BAKE SYDNEY CULTURE FROM UC BERKELEY. TIM GOLLUM. THE LIMO. ASSESSMENT TELL ME IN A BILL ARE NO FILLER NO OKAY TO LEARN HOW TO LEARN A FROM UC SANTA CRUZ RIGHT. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE THAT RACHEL. SUMAC. OKAY WHO IS EXECUTIVE IN. AND DIRECTED FOUND OF SWIPE OUT HUNGER. AND YOU SEE A LOT HILL I'M NOT WHO WILL SPEAK TO US UNLESS WE HAVE DOMINIQUE WILLIAMS A CURRENT STUDENT FROM UC BERKELEY AND PART OF THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. WHEN YOU SEE WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO TRY EACH ONE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS THE FIVE MINUTES YOU HAVE A LARGER PANEL THANK YOU. IT WOULD RUIN OUR OWE YOU GUYS DECIDE WAS THE START. SO WE'RE GOOD AND TIM ARE TOGETHER OKAY YEAH GETTING GROUP THAT ATTACKED HIM OKAY THIS. OKAY SO. THEY GOT SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TODAY. AND THAT TAKES TESTIFIED IN I'M I'M RUBEN DOES MY BROTHER TIM RIGHT HERE. WE GO TO THE SYSTEM WIDE BASIC NEEDS EFFORT AND HAVE WORKED ON THE IMPACT MEASUREMENT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION. ACROSS ALL TEN OF OUR CAMPUSES. YEAH THANK YOU TO WHOEVER ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON I'M FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY HOW WE DID THIS KICKOFF YESTERDAY THE EDUCATION FINANCE COMMITTEE AND I'M GOING DEEPER AND BRING THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE ONGOING CONVERSATION. SAYS RUBIN NOTED OUR OUR TEN CAMPUS IN USE UP CHO COORDINATION AS THE INTERLOPERS FOR BASIC NEEDS EFFORT. WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LISTEN AND LEARN TO OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE UNDERGRADUATE PROFESSIONAL. ON TO OUR STAFF AND FACULTY IN AS WELL TO HELP CREATE IMAGES OF WHAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER AND WE'RE HERE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF OUR EFFORTS TO DATE. AND THIS IS INCLUDE LAUNCHING IN SCALING UP NUTRITIOUS INTEREST BASED FOOD PANTRIES ON ALL CAMPUSES. INCREASING ACCESS TO FOOD PROVISIONING IN PREPARATION WORKSHOPS AND SERVICES. SPENDING SO ABOUT HUNGER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW YOU SEE STUDENTS TO DONATE EXCESS MEAL PLAN DOLLARS. STUDENTS IN NEED ON ALL CAMPUSES ESTABLISHING COLLABORATIONS WITH STATING COUNTY OFFICES TO REGISTER STUDENTS FOR CALTRANS. CITY CALIFORNIA'S NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ENHANCING FINANCIALLY COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT HOUSING AND FOOD COSTS AMONG OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS AND ALL TEN CAMPUSES. SO FEDERAL FUNDING LOW'S STATE FUNDING LOS CONSISTENT INCREASE INSTITUTIONAL CROSSING CONSISTENT INCREASE COST OF LIVING. MAKE TODAY'S COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND THE SUPPORT ITS IS THE CREATION OF FEDERAL PELL GRANT AND SEVENTY TWO. AS WORK IN FOOD SECURITY PROGRESS HE BECAME CLEAR THAT INSECURITY WAS JUST ONE COMPONENT OF A LARGER SPECTRUM OF A BASIC NEEDS FRAMEWORK. THAT MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE HARDSHIPS PRESENTED BY THE OVERALL COST OF ATTENDANCE FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING FOOD. HOUSING AND WELLNESS RELATED EXPENSES. AND DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE PUBLISHED OUR LARGEST THAT HE TO DATE THE UC STUDENT FOOD HOUSING SECURITY STUDY. HERE SOME OF THE MAJOR LESSONS WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE OVER SIXTY THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATE AND OVER SIX THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENT PARTICIPANTS. NUMBER ONE WHERE ADDRESSING A GENERAL UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION FACING FORTY FOUR PERCENT LOW IN VERY LOW FOOD SECURITY. BY UTILIZING A MULTI FACTOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE MOST AT RISK GROUPS AND PRIORITIZING SUPPORT STRATEGIES FOR THEM. TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR. WE HAVE DEVELOPED BETTER GUIDANCE SYSTEMS FOR CAL FRESH BENEFIT ENROLLMENT AND QUALIFICATION FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL AS MULTI FACTOR ANALYSES. TO IDENTIFIED THE GREATER ASKS RISK GROUPS. FIVE PERCENT OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS SELF REPORTING EXPENSING HOMELESSNESS AT SOME POINT OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR CONSISTENTLY BLACK NATIVE AMERICAN FORMER FOSTER YOUTH TRANSFER STUDENTS STUDENTS IN HUMANITIES. AND ADVANCE FOURTH FIFTH YEAR STUDENTS HAVE MUCH HIGHER RATES OF HOMELESSNESS THEIR HOMELESSNESS RATES VARY FROM EIGHT TO THIRTEEN PERCENT. ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS HAS A NOTABLE EFFECT ON ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. DATA FROM OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES MAJORITY OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING BOTH FOOD INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS WERE BELOW THE THREE POINT OH GPA. WHICH IS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR ON AND OFF CAMPUS STUDENT EMPLOYABILITY ACCESS TO RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND POST GRADUATION OPPORTUNITIES. ONLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE EXPANSIVELY SECURITY HOMELESSNESS REPORT BEING ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE ON TIME COMPARED WITH EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE BOTH FOOD AND HOUSING SECURE. AS BRIEFLY OVERVIEW HERE IF WE CONTINUE TO APPLY OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS WHICH STUDENT WHAT'S TARGETED STRATEGIC SUPPORT SERVICES. AND SO RESEARCH IS ONLY ONE PART OF OUR BASIC NEEDS MODEL WE HAVE FOUR AREAS THAT SHAPE. OUR SUPPLEMENTAL SLIDES WE PROVIDE A CAN GIVE A DIAGRAM OF THE AREAS. THAT WERE ENGAGING IN BASIC NEEDS EFFORTS COLLECTIVELY. SO THOSE EFFORTS ALSO INCLUDE CAMPUS PREVENTION MODELS AS WELL THE SUSTAINABILITY IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONALIZING BEST PRACTICES IN INFORMING EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY TO SUPPORT BASIC NEED SECURITY FOR ALL STUDENTS. IN THE LAST THREE YEARS YOU SEE PRESIDENT PAUL TANA'S INVESTED OVER FOUR MILLION TO OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS. IN THIS FISCAL YEAR WE ALSO RECEIVED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE STATE FOR THE HUNGER FREE CAMPUS INITIATIVE. HER INVESTMENT IN THE COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP OVER CAMPUS AND SYSTEMWIDE LEADERS HAVE PRODUCED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS TO DATE. SO YOU SEE IT PUBLISHES RUBIN NOTED THE LARGEST STUDY AND FOR YOUR RESEARCH UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES OF STUDENT FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITY WITH BOTH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF FOOD INSECURITY RISK FACTORS. COUPLE QUALITATIVE STUDIES AND LIVED EXPERIENCES FROM OUR STUDENTS THEMSELVES. FURTHER WE'VE INTEGRATED FOOD SECURITY QUESTIONS THAT'S WITHIN OUR SYSTEM WIDE STUDENT SURVEY TOOLS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO MEASURE LEVELS OF INSECURITY IN THE STERN EXPERIENCE. FOR ALL YOU SEE CAMPUSES TO DATE WE'VE ESTABLISHED INSTITUTIONAL BASIC NEEDS COMMITTEES COMPRISED OF STAFF FACULTY UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IF CENTRALIZED BASIC NEED RESOURCES ONLINE WITH WEB SITES THAT ARE MORE ACCEPTABLE IN STREAMLINED. WE'VE CREATED HEALTHY CHOICE BASED PANTRIES WITH SUPPLEMENTAL OF THAT INSIGHT BASED DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO TARGET EVENTS INSIGHTS AT A HIGHER RISK POPULATION SO WE CAN GO TO OUR STUDENTS ARE THAT NEED THE SUPPORT. OUR CALVET SUPPLICATION ENROLLMENT EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED ON SITE COORDINATION. WITH OUR COUNTY AN NGO PARTNERS TO IMPROVE THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT SEX SUCCESS RATE IS ALL THE ONLINE APPLICATION PARTNERSHIPS WITH CODE FOR AMERICA SO WE STREAMLINED AND UP THE COAST IN THIRTY TO TEN MINUTES. TO ROLL STUDENTS AND NOW THE US ARE SEVEN REVISION WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO RENEW IN THREE MINUTES. THIS IS REALLY EXCITING FOR THE STUDENT PROCESS AS YOU KNOW TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OF STUDENTS BETWEEN CLASSES AND WHAT NOT. IN A BASIC NEED SKILL DEVELOPMENT WORKSHOPS AND TRAINING FOR FINANCIAL LITERACY TO FOOD PREPARATION AND PROVISIONING ARE FEATURED ON EVERY TEN OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND AT PRESENT FIVE OF THE TEN UC CAMPUSES HAVE GONE FURTHER BY LAUNCHING A MULTI FUNCTION BASIC NEEDS CENTER TO CENTRALIZE THE NEEDS AND INFORMATION SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. WITH ALL CAMPUS IS COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING CENTER IS BY TWENTY TWENTY. WE PROVIDED INPUT AND SUPPORT THE RESEARCH AND STUDENT TESTIMONIALS THE STATE ASSEMBLY BILL PROCESS SEES FROM AB NINETEEN THIRTY. SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN TO FOURTEEN IN AB FOUR FIFTY THREE AND AGAIN WE WE THANK BOTH OF OUR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE HERE FOR HEARING THE STUDENTS. AND THE COMMUNITY IN RESPONDING WITH EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY ACTION. SO AS PART OF THE HUNDRED FREE CAMPUS EACH PUBLICAR DUCATION SECTOR WAS AWARDED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. IN THE UC CAMPUS WE AWARDED THOSE EQUAL OCCASIONS TO THE TEN CAMPUSES A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WITH PROGRAMMATIC FOLKS IT FOCUSES ON EMERGENCY MEALS CAL FRESH OUT REACH ENROLLMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PROGRAM STAFFING SUPPORT SO SURE YESTERDAY IN THE SENATE EDUCATION FINANCE BUDGET COMMITTEE PAUL FUNDS WILL BE EXPENDED ON THIS FOCUS. FOR THE STUDENT LEVEL. WHILE CONTINUES TO GROW AND SO WE SEEK TO EXPLORE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE STATE TO ADVANCE OUR BASIC NEEDS SECURE AGENDA FOR STUDENTS. AND I JUST WANNA ADDITIONAL NOTRE INTER SEGMENTAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CCC IN CS YOU COULD BE STRONGER THAN THEY ARE TODAY IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR DRIVE ME COMING HERE AND SEEING OUR. A PARTNERS COLLEEN ENTITIES AND OUR STUDENTS NEED IS ALTOGETHER THINK INCREASE THE VILLAGE FEEL THAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. FULL SQUAT IN THE BUILDING THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE. SO THAT. THE CONSTANT BASIC NEEDS IN SECURITIES A IT'S IT'S IT'S A SYSTEMIC CHALLENGE. STUDENT FINANCIAL FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURE WILL NOT CORRECT ITSELF OUR RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED KEY INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT COLLEGE STUDENT BASIC NEEDS WE CAN IMPROVE ON THAT THREE KEY OF THE FOLLOWING THE EDUCATION A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ABOUT PERSON ON COLLEGE FINANCES AS WELL AS SKILLS THAT WILL SUPPORT THEIR BASIC NEEDS THROUGH COLLEGE AND BEYOND. PREVENTION SERVICES AND STAFFING TO IMPROVE ON BOARDING AND SUPPORT THROUGH GRADUATION OF OUR STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. AND STATE FUNDING FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT IN OUR STATE WE PROVIDE MORE FUNDING PER STATE PRISONER THEM PER STATE COLLEGE STUDENT. WE MUST LEAD AS A STATE THE CALL TO REINVEST IN PUBLIC HIGH DUCATION AS WE DID DURING THE CREATION OF THE GI BILL IN THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT. THE GENERATIONS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES COULD WORK TEN HOURS A WEEK DURING SCHOOL IN THIRTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK DURING SUMMER. TO FULLY COVER THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE TODAY'S STUDENTS WORKING THOSE EXACT SAME OUR CAN ONLY PAY FOR ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. THERE MORE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS LOW INCOME AND WORKING CLASS STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENT PARENTS AND ADULTS STUDENTS TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. EACH OF THESE INTERSECTIONAL IDENTITIES PROVIDE EXPERIENTIAL GENERATIONAL WISDOM THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE INNOVATION IMPROVEMENT OF OUR CITIES COUNTIES AND STATE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING CLOSELY WITH YOU TO MAKE OUR STATE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM BASIC NEED TO CARE EQUITABLE SUCCESSFUL AND THE GLOBAL STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE. AND I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE SPECIFIC WAYS THAT THE STATE CAN SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. END UP AND. SLIGHT DIG THAT WE CREATED FOR YOU WE ISOLATED THE LAST LIKE DID YOU JUST GIVE YOU THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT WERE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS IF HE WANTED TO. GOOD LOOKS GOOD THANK YOU ALRIGHT RACHEL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING MEAN TO BE ON THIS PANEL AND TO SPEAK AT THIS HEARING STATE SOMEONE RUBBER. IT IS AN INCREDIBLE HONOR AND I. COME TO THE TABLE YES AS A YOU SEE ELLIE ALONE BOTH THE PERSPECTIVE TODAY AS THE CEO AND COFOUNDER OF SWIPE AT HOME VERY WHICH IS A NATIONAL INDEPENDENT FIVE A ONE. SEE THREE NONPROFIT WHICH FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS HAS BEEN PARTNERING WITH UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO ADDRESS COLLEGE STUDENT HUNGER. IN THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SCALE TO DOZENS OF COLLEGES ACROSS NINETEEN STATES SERVING ONE POINT FOUR MILLION MEALS AND YOU HAVE THE PLEASURE OF WORKING WITH. THE STATE ASSEMBLY ON EIGHTY FOUR FIFTY THREE WHICH BECAME SB EIGHTY FIVE ON THE HUNGER FOR CAMPUS SPELL. ANYTHING THE MOST INSPIRING PART OF ALL OF IT IS HOW. THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S SPOKEN TODAY HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THE FUNDING IS MADE AND WE REALLY HOPE TO SEE THAT WE GET SHARED IF NINE PIECE IN THE COMING UP IN THE COMING YEAR. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON SPEAKING TODAY WHO IS NOT EMPLOYEES OR A STUDENT OF THE STATE I. WANNA MAKE SURE THAT MY SUPPORT FOR THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE PUBLIC CITIZEN AND EYES AND NONPROFIT WHO HAS SEEN THIS WORK APPEN ACROSS THE STATE AND KNOWS. BUT THE VALUE OF BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM BEING SHARED IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS WHENEVER THERE'S MONEY ON THE TABLE TO DROP PEOPLE TOGETHER. AS A STUDENT AT UCLA MY FRIEND BRIAN AND I STARTED SWIPE A HUNGER WHICH WAS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED STUDENTS WHO DON'T NEED THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEIR MEAL PLAN TO THEIR PEERS. BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN YOU SAID HE WAS NOT A VERY BIG FAN OF THIS BUT WITH PARTNERSHIP AND COMING TOGETHER AROUND. A BIT OF TEENAGE ANGST WE WERE ABLE TO GET YOU SEE LA ON BOARD AND NOW HAVE AS MUNCH AND SKILL ALONG TO ALL UC'S. SUCH A DOZEN CSU'S HALF A DOZEN CS USE AND WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS YOU HEARD FROM DOCTOR GRASS ON MUCH MORE INNOVATIVE WAYS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES. LIKE FOR FARMERS MARKETS LIKEN VOUCHERS AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PANTIES. THE FIRST POINT I REALLY WANT TO URGE TODAY IS THAT THE WELL. HAS NEVER EVER EVER BEEN MORE OPPOSED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THAT'S NOT JUST AMONGST THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM BUT IN THE PUBLIC IF YOU TURN ON GOOGLE ALERTS FOR THE PHRASE. FOOD INSECURITY AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS YOU'RE GOING TO GET SEVERAL ARTICLES EVERYDAY. IF YOU TALK TO ANY OF THE CAMPUS CATERERS I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN. A WITNESS TO HOW MULTINATIONAL MULTIMILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS LIKE AM I CONSIDER EXCEL HAVE GONE FROM NO IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN TO NOW THROUGH OUR PROGRAM. INVESTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN YOUR CREDITS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE TRULY SERVING ALL STUDENTS ON CAMPUS WHEN IT COMES ACCESS TO FOOD. I THINK THIS BRINGS USED BY LARGER POINT WHICH IS AS YOU FOR TODAY FOOD IS NOT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST ON OUR CAMPUSES IT'S ACCESSIBLE. BUT TO THINK ABOUT PAYING TEN DOLLARS EVERY TIME YOU ON A SALAD OR ANYTIME YOU WANT A BURGER IS GONNA MAKE ANYONE GO BROKE. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND PARTNERSHIP. AND FOR THE FOOD RETAILERS THAT WE HAVE ON CAMPUS. IF IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO LOWER THE COST OFSUBSIDIZE ACOSTA LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THEN HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE ISN'T A BARRIER TO MEETINGS TO SHOW THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME FOOD. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE RISKS WE WOULD RECEIVE INTEREST FORMS FROM FIVE TO SEVEN UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERY MONTH. THESE WERE ALWAYS FROM STUDENTS. IN THE PAST YEAR FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN OVER HALF OF THE INTEREST FORMS RECEIVE COME DIRECTLY ROM ADMINISTRATORS AND DINING PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES. WE SEE THIS IS A HUGE SHIFT IN THE WAY ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS ARE STARTING TO COME TOGETHER. MY FAVORITE ANALOGY LIKE TALK ABOUT OUR WORK IS BE IF YOU GIVE A MANIFESTS. RIGHT SO WE'RE GIVING WE HAVE THESE PANTRIES. NO NO NO IT'S GONNA ORDER. OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES WHETHER IT'S PENSIONS OUR MEAL VOUCHERS. ARE GIVING OUR STUDENTS AFFAIRS. WE'RE TEACHING OUR SCHOOLS HOW TO FISH BY GIVING THEM THE FUNDING AND BEST PRACTICES TO UPDATE THE SCHOOLS THAT REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS THAT ARE PRESENT TODAY. AND IF WE WANT TO TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER. THAT'S REVOLUTIONIZING THE FISHING INDUSTRY HARDLY ME EXTRA FROM THE GET GO EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO FINISH THAT MEANS WE BRING ON MY ADVICE A VOTE OF NO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE CAN DO. IS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONTACTS THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SIGNING BOTH WITH OUR FOOD PROVIDERS WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS MAKING SURE THAT. WE HOPE OUR STUDENTS INTERESTS BEFORE ANYONE SHAREHOLDER INTEREST MAKING FOR A CONTRACTOR ETHICAL SO HOW DO WE MAKE SHOULD OWN IT COMES TO FOOD AS A PIECE FINE. WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS A PIPELINE PROBLEM DOESN'T CONTINUE. AS A CLOSING NO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT INNOVATION AND AND PARTNERSHIP CONTINUES TO SAY ON THE TABLE EYES THESE BILLS COME UP I WOULD DO THE PEOPLE MOST HUMOR SO DEALER JAPAN. I HOPE THAT WE DON'T SCRAP. THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED AT THINGS WE PUT FORWARD BUT RATHER REALLY INVEST IN INNOVATING ON TOP OF AMENDED RATING TO MAKE THEM BETTER. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH LEARNING THAT HAPPENS AND OTHER STUDENTS GO THROUGH THE SYSTEM WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO LEARN. I WAS A STUDENT AT STEPPED UP STARTED A PROGRAM THAT'S NOW HELPED. DO LAST YEAR ALONE TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ANGER STUDENTS CONSERVE AS A HUGE HUB OF INNOVATION BUT IT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY IT'S NOT ANY STUDENTS TO SPONSOR BILLETED TO HAVE TO. SUPPORT THEIR PEERS WILL PICK IT UP WILL PUSH THE OUTAGE WILL PUSH THE RED LINE. BUT WE NEED TO PASS THE BATON ON TO OUR STATE LEADERS AND I UNIVERSITY LEADERS AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR VOICES ARE BEING HEARD AND THAT THE WORK CONTINUES BEYOND OUR TIME ON CAMPUS THANK YOU THANK YOU. DOMINATE. HELLO THIS IS ON RIGHT OKAY. I. SORRY I'M A STUDENT I'M NEW TO THIS. SO MY NAME'S ON NICKELODEON'S AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR WEBER FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. SO. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT REGARDLESS SO MY TITLE IS I'M JUST A STUDENT THAT ALMOST WASN'T HERE TODAY AND I'LL. GET INTO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR GO TO UC BERKELEY. AND ALL WILL BE MY TEST TESTIMONY NOW. SOME OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR I CAL. MONIES IN FRIDAY'S I WOKE UP AT FIVE THIRTY AND STARTED A SHIFT IN THE DINING HALL. FINISHED AT TEN AM WALKED HOME SO THE FIFTY MINUTE POWER NAP UNTIL TEN TWENTY. AND CHANGE OUT OF MY DISCUSSING CLOSE TO GET TO MY FIRST CLASS ACROSS CAMPUS BEFORE TEN FORTY. ALSO WORK WEEKENDS. TUESDAY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY I'D MISS MORNING CLASSES TO TRAVEL TOSAN FRANCISCO TO WORK FROM TEN AM TO SEVEN PM. NOT GETTING HOME UNTIL EIGHT OR NINE WITH A LOT OF CLASSES AND SETTING TO CATCH UP ON. I RECEIVE NO FINANCIAL ASSISTANT FOR ASSISTANCE FROM MY PARENTS AND STILL DON'T. NOT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HELP BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD IT. THERE WERE TIMES THAT I HAD COME SO CLOSE TO MISSING MY REAP MY RENT PAYMENTS. A COUPLE TIMES I WENT OVER TO. AT SOME POINT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SECOND SEMESTER MY MIL POINTS WERE DEPLETED SAUCES SURVIVING ON SCRAPS. I'M OF THE NIGHT I BROKE DOWN IT JUST WET BECAUSE I WAS SO EXHAUSTED I WAS STRUGGLING AND I WAS FREAKING HUNGRY. AND LET ME TELL YOU I WAS I WAS AT A LUCKY. BECAUSE I STILL MADE. I'M TALKING RECIPIENT WHICH MEANS THAT PART OF MY TUITION IS PAID FOR. I WAS WORKING TWO JOBS JUST TO SCRAPE BY AND BURKE WAS ON CAMPUS HOUSING COSTS WHICH ARE RIDICULOUSLY HIGH. JUST THIS PAST YEAR I STARTED TO RECEIVE CALAVERAS WHICH IS THE EBT PROGRAM ALLOWS LOW INCOME PERSONS TO ACCESS FOOD. AND I'M EXTREMELY THANKFUL FOR THE FOR THE WORK THAT DOCTOR WEBER DID IN OFFERING AB TWENTY FOUR. TO FOURTEEN LAST YEAR. I BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT AREN'T SO LUCKY. I MEMBER CALLOUS FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES THAT MISS RIGHT PAYMENTS AND WERE KICKED OUT OF THEIR APARTMENTS. THEY START AND WERE FORCED TO DROP OUT. THEN HOW TO KNOW HOW TO BUDGET MANAGE MY TIME AD DIG DEEP. HOW BE A COW AND SITTING BEFORE YOU ALL TODAY? I THINK THIS GOES TO SHOW ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES ABOUT BECAUSE CONTAINS YOU. THE STRUGGLES ARE INJURED WITHIN MY TIME HERE CAL DEVELOPED IN ME A CERTAIN LEVEL GRAY. A PSYCHOPATH AND TO PUSH MY LIMITS. I SURPRISE MYSELF CONSTANTLY WITH HOW MUCH I CAN INDOOR AND HAVE BEEN DOING ANY CREATES A CERTAIN SENSE OF PRIDE IN ONE'S OWN JOURNEY. MOREOVER IT'S GIVING ME THE GREAT TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU AND TELL YOU FRANKLY THAT NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE TO ERADICATE THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE OF MY STORY IT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR STARVATION TO BE A COLLEGE REQUIREMENT FOR DEGREE ATTAINMENT. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR HOMELESSNESS TO BE A REALITY FOR THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE PRACTICES OF EVEN TOP RAHMAN COUCHSURFING HAD BEEN A REGULAR PART OF THE CAUSE GOING BECAUSE CULTURE. GETTING ONLY THE MOST RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A COLLECTIVE REALIZATION THAT THESE PROBLEMS EXIST AND THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE. INDEED IT IS CRITICAL FOR STUDENT SUCCESS THAT HE OR SHE HAS THE SOUND PLACE TO SLEEP PROPERLY TO NUTRITION TO SAY HEALTH AND FOCUS. A PROBLEM IT'LL. SECURITY AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO ENGAGE A STUDIES SUCKS IT SUCCESSFULLY IN HOLY. THE FIRST LEVEL OF MASS LOW'S PERIOD OF A PYRAMID OF HUMAN NEEDS ENCOMPASSES SECURING PHYSIOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BREEDING FOOD WATER SHELTER CLOTHING AND SLEEP. A LACK OF ACCESS TO SUCH BASIC NEEDS IN. NOT ONLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS SOONER SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH AND MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTAIN HIGHER EDUCATION. GOOD ANSWER AND SECURITY HAS BEEN LINKED TO CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS HIGHER RATES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. SINCE OUR STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF BED IF THEY HAVE ONE BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING FROM ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT MY HOME CAMPUS UC BERKELEY. THE CROWN JEWEL OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE STATE'S CROWN JEWEL YES YES ODYSSEUS CROWN JEWEL DOESN'T EVEN GUARANTEE FIRST YEAR HOUSING TO EVERY FRESHMAN AMY ANYMORE. AMID A GROWING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BERKELEY TOPPED SEVERAL BE CISCO SAN FRANCISCO GATE LIST OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE COLLEGE TOWNS IN THE COUNTRY. SAN FRANCISCO GATES RANKING IS BASED ON BECAUSE SOUNDS WHERE AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS ROLE IS ENROLLED IN A UNIVERSITY. ANYTHING AND IS COMPOSED OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS. BERKELEY AT THE POPULATION OF THIRTY POINT FIVE PERCENT STUDENTS AND BERKELEY TOPS THIS LIST. AMONG THE OTHER MOST EXPENSIVE BECAUSE TOWNS SANTA CRUZ WHICH IS ALSO ANOTHER YOU SEE SCHOOL. CAMBRIDGE BOULDER AND PRINCETON. FOR CAP IS ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CITY AND REGIONAL PLANNING MODEL HUTS IN. THE REASON FOR BERKELEY STATUS IS SUCH AN EXPENSIVE LOCATION RESTS ON THE LACK OF HOUSING AVAILABLE IN THE AREA WHICH IS PERPETUATED BY THE GREAT DEMAND TO LIVE CLOSE TO CAMPUS. ASIDE FROM HOUSE FROM FOOD AND HOUSING IN SECURITY MENTAL HEALTH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF BASIC NEEDS. ON MANY CAMPUSES IT TAKES WEEKS ACCESS IN PERSON COUNSELING SERVICES. THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME FOR AN APPOINTMENT ACROSS YOU SEE IS TWENTY ONE DAYS AND ARE CAPS USUALLY FIVE SIX VISITS HOW MANY TIMES PER YEAR. STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE RECEIVE HELP. THIS TO BE MORE INVESTMENT IN EXCESS OF BILLION OUT WE SERVICES ON OUR CAMPUSES AS WELL AS A HUMAN OF MORE DIVERSE COUNTLESS REFLECT THE STUDENT BODY CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF STUDENTS TODAY. IN TERMS OF INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE TO BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITIES THE UCC IS UC SYSTEM ITSELF HAS DEVELOPED VERY STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. MOST OF THE STRIDES HE'S THUS FAR ARE FOCUSED ON FOOD SECURITY. HOW YOU SEE MEASURES THE NEED FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND STUDY INTO THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE HOUSING IN THIS TWENTY SIXTEEN ANNUAL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT? PRESIDENT OF POTS ON A RECENTLY LAUNCHED THE STUDENT HOUSING INITIATIVE FOR THE GOAL OF PROVIDING FOURTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE BAD FOR UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. BY TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S TWO YEARS FROM NOW. I PERSONALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ON TRACK TO THAT GOAL IF EVERY CAMPUS IS BUILT SEVEN HUNDRED NEW BEDS IN THE LAST YEARS IN ORDER TO MEET ITS QUOTA. LIKE BERKELEY HAS. WE ARE STILL LESS THAN HALF WAY% TOWARDS OUR GOALS OF THE FILL THE TWENTY TWENTY PLAN IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AS YOU SEE INCREASES HOUSING STOCK ANY DEMANDS IN A ROMAN NEW HOUSING PROJECTS SHOULD INCORPORATE PLANS TO HOW STUDENTS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY ACCOMMODATIONS. STAY IN THE UC CAN DEVELOP DISPLAYS HOUSING FUNDS TO COVER BASIC NEEDS FOR STUDENTS FACING CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR DIE CIRCUMSTANCES. IF ON CAMPUS HOUSING IS NOT AVAILABLE AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY FUNDS ALLOWING CAMPUSES TO SUBSIDIZE RENTS FOR STUDENTS MOST FINALLY FINANCE LEAN MEAT. IN THIS IN ADDITION THERE CAN BE FURTHER INVESTMENT IN COOPER HOUSING PROPERTIES WHICH IN HOW STUDENTS AND MORE FOR THE RENTS. IN ORDER TO SAVE CALIFORNIA FROM ITS LOOMING ONE POINT ONE MILLION COLLEGE DEBT. COLLEGE DEGREE DEFICIT IN THE FUTURE HARD CHOICES NEED TO BE MADE TODAY. IT IS OBVIOUS WE NEED AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH TO SOLVING THESE DEEP SEEDED ISSUES. WE CAN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE OF STERN HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS IF FOR ONLY TACKLING FOOD SECURITY OR HOUSING OR MENTAL HEALTH SINGULARITY SINGLING. OUR SYSTEM IN OUR STATE MUST WORK COLLECTIVELY ON ADDRESSING THEM ALL IN ORDER TO ENSURE SENSE OF COLOR FIRST OR RENT GENERATION AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ACHIEVE THEIR DEGREES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN. CLEARLY. MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE OF. TAKE HIM AT THE CHALLENGE SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S AND THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. ALL I CAN REMEMBER FOR PROBABLY FOUR YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE AS. THE STATION WITH REGARDS TO WHAT'S GOING ON OUR CAMPUSES A WE WOULD STILL BE TALKING ABOUT COUCHSURFING IS IF THERE'S SOME WONDERFUL THING TO ENGAGE IN. A BECAUSE IT PLAYING IT SOUNDS GOOD. OR OF STUDENTS WHO LIVE OFF TOP RAHMAN AND. AND THINK THAT THAT'S A IT'S KIND OF A CHOICE THEY MADE BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO GO TO A CONCERT. AND IF I CHOSE TO GO TO. ETOPS RAMAN VERSUS BY REGULAR OF THE FOOD SO I THINK THE CONVERSATION CLEARLY SAYS TO US ALL OVER THE LAST. OF THREE FOR USE THAT WITH THE LEGISLATION WE'VE DONE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE GOTTEN A PROCESS BY NO MEANS ARE WE COMPLETE. BUT AT LEAST WE'VE BEGUN THE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS YOU BEGUN TO SHARE THE INFORMATION AMONGST YOURSELVES WHICH IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THAT NO CAMPUS FEELS ALONE IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT IT IS A A PART OF ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS THAT ARE THERE AND EVEN SOME OF OUR PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ARE TAKING UP. AND FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE CAMPUS ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO HOUSING AND FOOD. WHEN I GO TO THE PRIVATE CAMPUS IS THEY ARE ALSO WRESTLING WITH THAT BECAUSE THE DEALING WITH THE SAME STUDENTS TO I MEAN IT'S NOT THAT. STUDENTS WHO GO TO THESE MORE EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE ANY WEALTHIER THAT NOT THAT THE SAME STUDENTS THAT ARE COMING. OUT OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN GOING TO UNIVERSITIES SO I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS WE'VE GOT YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND THIS BEGINS THIS GIVES US GOOD. SUGGESTIONS FOR THE COMING LEGISLATIVE YEAR AS TO WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND HOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT IT'S IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND. WHEN WE CREATE THESE BILLS THAT. WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THE HEARING TODAY THAT SO WE CAN FIGURE WITH THE FLAWS ARE. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE CAN PASS THE BILL FOR EBT IT IF WE DON'T. WITH IF FOLKS AREN'T SAYING SOME ARE YOU SAYING IT'S REALLY WORKING WELL ON YOUR CAMPUS YOU THAT HUNDRED PERCENT PARTICIPATION. OF THIS IS SAYING IT'S A STRUGGLE ON OUR SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WITH THE GLITCHES ARE. YOU KNOW WHERE THE WHERE THE INFORMATION NEEDS TO GO IN TERMS OF BEING SHARED BUT BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE THOSE WHO MAY WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE THIS IS THE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS IF ANYONE HAS. A STATEMENT THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OR QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO DO IT. AND SO. WOULD YOU PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE HERE. AND. WE WILL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. AND OR CONCERNS AND PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU FROM WHEN YOU HAVE A MINUTE. PAULSON THANK YOU. SUNDAY AFTERNOON MY NAME'S CHOOSE THE TERRACE AND I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF FOR THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION I'M ALSO FOURTH YOUR UNDERGRAD AT UC SANTA CRUZ. SADEQ START BY THANKING YOU ALL FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DISCUSS AND TACKLE THE ISSUES OF BASIC NEED SECURITY. IT'S ALSO HEART WARMING TO SEE THAT WILL TO PROSTITUTION IS A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION OR TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ADDRESS THE INSECURITIES. STUDENTS ARE FACING TODAY. I USE CSMA WE'VE ADOPTED A CAMPAIGN CALLED UC'S SUSTAIN OUR STUDENTS. THAT ADDRESSES FOOD AND HOUSING SECURITIES ALONG WITH THE STIGMA BEHIND THESE ISSUES. IT'S CLEAR TO SEE THAT STUDENT HUNGER AND STUDENT HOMELESSNESS IS RECOGNIZE AT THE SYSTEM WIDE LEVEL AND NOW AT THE STATE. CAMPUSES HAVE OPENED UP FOOD PANTRIES PORTER STUDENTS THERE BEGINNING TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY FUNDS FOR STUDENTS IN DIRE NEED. BUT LIKE SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER THESE ARE ONLY SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHERE THE STIGMA BEHIND BASICALLY SECURITY STUDENT SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED ACADEMICALLY AND THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY TO SUCH RESOURCES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. OKAY. SYNDICATES DE ON BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT MEETING. WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING EFFORTS ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES TO REALLY ADDRESS BASIC NEEDS AS WE KNOW AND IT'S MUCH MORE THAN ON COMPLETION IT'S ABOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE STUDENT AND SUPPORTING THEM IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO MENTION THAT FACT IS. SUPPORTING A BILL OR HOLDING A BILL A BETWEEN NINE THIRTY THREE OFFERED BY AND. AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA RELATED TO. BUILT BRIDGING THAT THE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE COUNTIES WHICH WE SEE AS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT SLOW MOAN IS BACK IF YOU HAVE ANY. PARTING COMMENTS. I SO I THINK YOU ALL I KNOW THIS WELCOME TO OUR LIFE RIGHT IN AND OUT. I THINK YOU ALL AT FOR YOUR WORK FOR YOUR ON GOING WORK AND I I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO US IS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL. ON AS WE IN THE LEGISLATURE TRIED TO IDENTIFY NOT JUST THE NEEDS THE HOW TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. DATIN THAT DRIVE US TO MEET THESE UNMET NEEDS FOR STUDENTS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT PARTICULARLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULARLY WHAT THE POTENTIAL ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. AND COULD BE IN. BIG AND WE KNOW THAT. STUDENTS ALONE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES FACING AND SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES OUR COMMUNITY IT'S IT'S BIGGER THAN THE UNIVERSITY LIFE BUT I THINK IT'S BEEN EXACERBATED. ON IN THE UNIVERSITY LIFE AND IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I SAW ON IN MY TIME I MEAN HIGHER AND AS I'M SURE. YOU HAVE DOCTOR ROBERT DID AS WELL SO THINK YOU. WELL I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING THIS LET ME FIRST OF ALL THANK MY STAFF SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW WITH THE GIVE YEAH YEAH. TIFFANY BOY IS A MY FELLOW WHO YOU HERE WITH ME. A GRADUATE OF. CAL STATE SAN MARCOS AND. AN AMAZING FELLOW AND SHE'S TAKEN WAS CHARGED ONE THINK HARRISON HIND HARRISON IS SOMEWHERE AROUND THE HARRISON IS ACTUALLY GRADUATING FROM MED SCHOOL. AND HE'S BEEN IN MY OFFICE NOW FOR THE LAST. MAYBE FIVE OR SIX MONTHS DOING AMAZING WORK ON HEALTH ISSUES FOR US AND HE WAS HERE TODAY SETTING UP SOME OF THOSE SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE TO HEAR SOME. AND THEN ROY KAUFMAN IS IN THE BACK TO ALWAYS MOVING AND GROOVING AND TAKING CARE OF THINGS SOLELY CENTRAL. SO I THINK THOSE THREE THEY TOOK THE LEAD WITH THE BY OF THE STAFF AND LENDING SUPPORT MY HAVE AN AMAZING STAFF OF YOU'VE EVER WORKED WITH THEM. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY OF. ALL KEEP ME. MOVING NOW BUT THEY ARE. THEY THEY BRING UP THE CRITICAL ISSUES WELL THINK ALSO SET UP A YOUNG MAN NAMED SCOTT. MATSUMOTO SCOTT WAS OF MY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WORKED IN OUR OFFICE ONE AS A VOLUNTEER AND THEN AS A STAFFER. WHO REALLY A USED TO OF? BASICALLY WAS IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THE UC CAMPUS CLIMATE COMMITTEES AND HE WAS VERY AND STILL IS VERY COMMITTED TO IT HE'S STILL IN THE HOUSE HE WORKS IN THIS BUILDING. BODIES IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE NOW AS A CONSULTANT HE'S BEEN ELEVATED TO ANOTHER LEVEL AS A AS A OUT CONSULTANT FOR. THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE BUT DOES HE BROUGHT THESE ISSUES FORWARD INTO A LOT OF THE EARLY RESEARCH AND AND WORK WITH CAMPUS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. YOU KNOW I'VE TAKEN UP THIS ISSUE FOR THE LAST THREE FOUR YEARS ACTUALLY THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND. AND WE'VE SEEN NOT ONLY. BEFORE WE HAD A SELECT COMMITTEE WE TOOK UP THE ISSUE OF EBT CARDS ON CAMPUSES AND I HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS A STUDENT MIND AT SAN DIEGO STATE. WHO CAME TO WORK ON MY CAMPAIGN IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN I RAN FOR THE ASSEMBLY? AND SHE WAS THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED THE QUESTION OF WHY WE CAN'T HAVE THE BT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. OF SHE WAS INVOLVED WITH MY DEPARTMENT WAS CHAIR OF THE PART OF AFRICA STUDIES AND SHE BEGAN DOING RESEARCH AS SHE WAS OF ONE OF THE STUDENTS OF. IN MY CLASS TING RESEARCH A WHEN I WAS ELECTED SHE CAME TO THE CAPITOL. DID A A SEMESTER KIND OF INTERNSHIP HERE AT THE CAPITOL WAS SHE WAS GRADUATING FROM SAN DIEGO STATE. TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS A RECIPIENT SHE HAD SHE WAS A SEPARATE OF CAL FRESH. AND SHE ROOM AND AND SHE MADE ME AWARE HOW COMPLICATED IT WAS TO LIVE WHILE WITH CAO FRESH ON CAMPUSES ESPECIALLY CAMPUSES CROWDED THE SAN DIEGO STATE. AND SO FOR HER TO PARKER CAR AND BE VIEWED TAKING CLASSES THEN HAVE TO LEAVE THE CAMPUS IN ORDER TO. PURCHASE SOME FOOD. BECAUSE SHE COULDN USER EBT CARD ON CAMPUS. AND LETS YOU BUY JUNK FOOD AND SHE DIDN'T WANT JUNK. AND SO SHE'D HAVE TO GET IN HER CAR TO GO OAK TO REST OF SOMEPLACE SO SHE COULD GET A HOT MEAL WITH A RESTAURANT MEAL PROGRAM. SO SHE MADE ME AWARE OF THAT AND IT WAS A SQUARE BATTLE WE GET OFF AT THE FIRST PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT EBT CARD AND IT DIDN'T AND WE COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS. BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST WEREN'T READY FOR THEY DID UNDERSTAND THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. AND I AND I UNIVERSITIES RESISTED. THEY RESISTED VEHEMENTLY BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WOULD COST TOO MUCH IT EXTREME PRICE TAG ON IT OZONE SOMEONE OF LIKE A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CAMPUS. IN ORDER TO GET AN EBT CARD MACHINE. FORTUNATELY AND AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE NUMBER THAT WAS GIVEN TO US AND SO BECAME IMPASSABLE BUS ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THE COST FACTOR WHILE THE CAMPUSES WELL THANK GOD FOR HOME BOTH STATE I THINK IT WAS. WHO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AND TOLD US IT COST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WHICH REALLY BLEW ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL PEOPLE? OUT OF THE WATER TO SAY THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING US TO ON A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND UP WERE PER CAMPUS AND HERE HUMBOLDT STATES IT WE DID IT FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SO THAT HE'LL THAT IDEA. AND OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE AND GET THESE EBT CARDS ON CAMPUSES BECAUSE THE INFORMATION WE WERE BEING GIVEN WAS FLAWED WOULD A CAMPUS HAD A DESIRE TO DO IT. THEY DID IT AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS GOING TO DO A TWENTY THOUSAND US I JUST ASSUME THEY WANT TO HIRE SOME NEW EMPLOYEES JUST DON'T OVERLOOK THE MACHINE. BUT. BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT THAT OPEN UP AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US AND WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT THE DATA IN THE RESEARCH CONCERNING. FOOD INSECURITIES AND I CAN SAY THAT I HAVE JUST BEEN TRULY AMAZED AND BLESSED BY THE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE THUS FAR AND TOTALLY COMMITTED TO CONSTANTLY DEALING WITH THE ISSUES AS YOU BRING THOSE BILLS FORWARD. THIS HOUSE THIS THIS ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE ARE VERY VERY COMMITTED TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AT FIRST LIKE I SAID IT WAS A STRUGGLE IN TWENTY TWELVE THIRTEEN TO GET BILLS OUT TO GET THEM HURT TO HAVE PEOPLE. UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON NOW WHEN THE BILL COMES FOR LIKE THE ONE I HAVE NOW THAT'S OUT THERE. IT IS EMBRACED BY MORE THAN JUST SHIRLEY WEBER AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY ARE BASICALLY AUTHORING PIECES OF LEGISLATION DEALING WITH THE ISSUES OF. FOOD INSECURITY IN HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR STUDENTS BOB AND SO I'M REALLY BUT AND AND THEN THEY'RE IMPRESSED BY WHAT YOU'VE DONE. YOU HAVE TAKEN WHAT WE SAID MAKE SHOULD HAPPEN AND REALLY WHAT THE REALIZADA TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL. AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK US TO DO THAT BECAUSE IF WE HAD DONE THAT. IF WE HAD SET UP FOOD BANKS. PANTRIES IN YOUR CAMPUSES ANYONE WHO GOT A CRACKER WOULD HAVE TO GIVE US THEIR NAME THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. TWO OR THREE OF THEIR CHILDREN A WHATEVER BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE REGULATED SO MUCH TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE TRULY TRULY HUNGRY YOU KNOW WE HAVE A HUNDRED TESTS. AND YOU HAVE DONE BETTER THAN THAT YOU HAVE SAID AS A CAMPUS WE BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER. WE TRUST EACH OTHER. AND WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE REAL ISSUES AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT HUMILIATE PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS OF GIVING THEM SUPPORT AND HELP. AND I HAVE LOVED. I HAVE BEEN SO AMAZED BECAUSE WE HAVE ONE HEARING THE SAN DIEGO SOMEONE ON PANEL ASKED WELL HOW OFTEN CAN A PERSON COME DO YOU MEAN YOU LET HIM COME MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH. AND EAGLE WELL YET THEY'RE STILL HUNGRY THEY NEED FOOD MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH AND SO IT WAS INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE JUDGE GENEROSITY AS AS STUDENTS AND AS PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH STUDENTS. WAS MUCH GREATER THAN OURS AS A STATE AND SO WHERE WE CAN GIVE THE TO ON A FIFTY THOUSAND WHATEVER IF WE HAD GIVEN IT. THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE GONE TO SO WITH WE IF WE HAD ADMINISTERED IT WOULD NOT HAVE GONE AS FAR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO TO AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO ADMINISTER IT AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS TAKEN THE RESOURCES AND MULTIPLY IT AND MADE IT REALLY COME ALIVE I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES YOU'VE GIVEN US SOME RECOMMENDATIONS DO NOT HESITATE TO SEND MORE RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR OFFICE. THAT IF YOU FIND THIS AND CHALLENGES TO SOME GLITCHES MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT TO US BECAUSE WE IN THIS HOUSE AND THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. ARE VERY COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE WE KNOW WE CAN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS WE GOT GREAT PROBLEMS OF HOUSING IN THE LARGER COMMUNITY WHICH I'M SURE YOU REALIZE.
