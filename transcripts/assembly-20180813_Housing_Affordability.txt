AYE IN TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING HOW PERFORMERS OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ARE ASSEMBLED AND CONSIDERED WHEN BUILDING. MARKET RATE UNITS -- OUR PANELISTS WALKS THROUGH A NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE THE ALLEN COSTS AND REVENUE PRODUCTIONS FOR FOUR TYPES DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY IN THE COASTAL GREEN FELT REDEVELOPMENT. AND TRADITIONAL INFILL ZONES OF FOLLOWING THOSE VISITATIONS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN THE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ON THE FACTORS AND VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THESE PERFORMERS. IT FINALLY WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AS WELL AS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

HOW MUCH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR LAWSUITS AND FEES AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT GET THROWN OUT A PROJECT? ABROAD LOOK AT FOR HYPOTHETICAL HOUSING PROJECTS COASTAL GREENFIELD REDEVELOPMENT INFILL AND INFILL EXTENSIVELY. AT THE CONCLUSION WILL DISCUSS ALSO FOR THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND THEN IT'LL BE TIME FOR Q. AND A SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I AM FIRST I WILL YOU ALREADY PRETTY MUCH INTRODUCE OUR PANEL BUT I THINK I SHOULD.

AND THEN INVOLVED IN FINANCING AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF HOUSING PROJECTS AND FINALLY -- I THAT IS IT NOW I GET TO KICK IT OVER TO LANE SO LAME IS GOING TO GIVE YOU. THE FACETS OF HOMEBUILDING. THANK YOU MY APOLOGIES FOR THINGS COULD HAVE YOUR NAME I DOES HAVE ONE BIT OF AMERICA NO NO NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU EILEEN AND THANK YOU CHAIRMAN GLORIA -- FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. OF BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE FOUR DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THAT WE WANT TO SHOW TODAY. I THOUGHT I WOULD FIRST CUTTING A LITTLE CONTEXT OF OUR BUSINESS AND HOW -- WORRIED YOU KNOW MEMBERS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY SOMETIMES TAKE ON ALL THE DISCIPLINE -- DISCIPLINES THAT COME WITH LAND DEVELOPMENT ENTITLEMENTS AND HOMEBUILDING AND SOME GET IF IF KINDA PARTITIONS. AND WHEN I MOVE A PARTITION IS YOU COULD HAVE A PARTICULAR -- LAND DEVELOPER THAT MIGHT FOCUS ON ACQUISITION JUST THROUGH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND SO. THEY ARE DEALING WITH -- LOOKING AT LAND THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS SEEN THROUGH A CITY OR A COUNTY. THEY'RE DEALING WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THEY'RE WORKING ULTIMATELY TO A POINT OF GETTING TO WHAT WE REFER TO AS A TENTATIVE MAP. AND AT THAT POINT -- THE PROJECT COULD POTENTIALLY BE BE SOLD TO ANOTHER -- DEVELOPER -- THAT WOULD THEN TAKE IT FROM THAT POINT FOR WHICH WOULD BE SOMEONE THAT WAS BEING AT DOING THE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND WERE YOU DOING THE A GRADING. YOUR ALSO TAKEN FROM ATTENDED A MAP TO A FINAL MAP YOU'RE DOING MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THE HOMES ARE GONNA LAY OUT. YOU'RE DEALING WITH ST LAYOUTS YOU'RE DEALING WITH SEWER WATER AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING THOSE PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS ALL TO REALLY GET THE DEVELOPMENT TO A POINT OF HAVING FINISHED LOTS. AT THE POINT OF HAVING FINISHED LOTS YOU COULD BE A DEVELOPER THAT WOULD THEN SELL FINISH LOTS TO WHAT I CALLED MERCHANT BUILDERS. AND SOMEONE OUR INDUSTRY THAT'S REALLY WHAT THEY'RE FOCUSES THEY ARE TRULY JUST A HOME BUILDER. THEY'RE NOT A LAND DEVELOPER THEY COME IN AT THE POINT OF A FINISH LOT IN THERE DOING WHAT WE CALL VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION AND SO. EACH ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE PROCESS HAS DIFFERENT RISK IN BASED ON THOSE RISKS THE HURDLES ARE THE METRICS OF HOW. WE ANALYZE A PROJECT AND WHETHER THAT PROJECT HAS KIND OF A GO NO GO AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. HAVE TO BE DETERMINE OTHERS SIMILAR TO SHADE HOMES THE COMPANY I WORK. FOR WE AT TIMES WILL DO ALL THREE WE WILL TAKE IT FROM THE POINT OF TYING UP A PROPERTY THAT COULD BE WITH THE LANDOWNER COULD BE IS A GREENFIELD FARMLAND. IT COULD BE A RE USE OF A OF AN OLD INDUSTRIAL BUILDING THAT WE THINK HAS THE ABILITY DUE TO AN AREA WHAT MONTH MIGHT NEED SOME HOUSING. TO MOVE FORWARD IN WITH THAT YOU HAVE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE SAME THE SAME ISSUES BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE DECONSTRUCTION YOU MIGHT HAVE ARE MIDDLE CONCERNS YOU HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. THAT WE WOULD TAKE A PROPERTY ALL THE WAY THROUGH A POINT OF BUILDING HOUSES OTHERS WOULD PICK ONE OF THE THREE AND THAT COULD BE THEIR OVERALL DISCIPLINE. IT'S JUST JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS DISTINCTION AND HOW WE EVALUATE PROPERTIES AND YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT ON THE EXAMPLES THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU. FACTORS INFLUENCING HOMEBUILDING YOU KNOW THE HAZARD IS A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ANALYZE. AND AS I MENTIONED EACH ONE OF THE COMPONENTS WITH IN THE PROCESS SOME OF THESE ARE MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN OTHERS. RELATIVE TO SOME OF ITS ABOUT IN TITLE IN A PROJECT TO THE POINT OF GETTING APPROVED TENTATIVE MAP WHERE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR REGULATORY APPROVALS. YOU'RE REALLY FOCUS ON SOME OF THOSE EARLY ONES THE ACQUISITION -- PROCESS HOW YOU'RE TYING UP THE PROPERTY A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T GO OUT AND BUY A PROPERTY -- IMMEDIATELY DAY ONE LET'S HAS WE DO IS WE TIE UP PROPERTIES UNDER A CONTRACT. AND AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH AND WE MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT ARE INHERENT IN THAT DEVELOPMENT THROUGH. WORKING THROUGH CONSULTANTS AND PROPERTY AND AS WE WORK WITH THE CITY'S THE REGULATORS AS WE ARE GET TO A POINT CLOSER TO ATTEND OF MAP. WE THEN WILL INVEST MORE DOLLARS AND ULTIMATELY ACQUIRE THE PROPERTY. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE TIME IT TAKES TO DO THAT IS A A FUNCTION OF CERTAIN RETURNS THAT WE'RE EXPECTING OUR INVESTMENT. AND SO TIME IS REALLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IN THE FINANCING STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE FOR A PARTICULAR DEAL. REASON WE HAVE SEQUEL UP THERE. IS THAT SEQUEL CAN BE ONE OF THOSE IMPEDIMENTS TO OUR TIMING THE COST OF NOT ONLY. PROVIDING A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE CHALLENGE OR LEAST JUST GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OF THE SEQUEL A REVIEW BUT THEN THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGE IN THAT EVEN IF WE WHEN THE CHALLENGE THERE COULD BE APPEALED PERIODS. IF YOU LOOK AT SEEK WITH THE MOUNTIE YEARS AND SOME OF US HAVE EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE TAKEN US MULTI MULTI YEARS. TO GET THROUGH APPROVAL PROCESS. BECAUSE A SEQUEL IS BEING USED AS A WAY OF CHALLENGING OUR PROJECT. ENTITLEMENTS WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THAT WORKING THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS ALONG WITH THE REGULATORY -- ISSUES WE NEED TO FOCUS ON DEVELOP AN IMPACT FEE SCHOOL FEES. IN EVERY CITY WE HAVE THESE CITY ARE COUNTIES WE HAVE FEES THAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY'RE NOT THE SAME -- IN NEED CITY -- I'M I DO A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN LIVERMORE. THE CITY FEES THERE ARE APPROACHING OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT. OTHER CITIES YOU MY WORK AND IT COULD BE AS LOW AS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY THOUSAND SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE FEE IMPACTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THAT CITY. INCLUDED INCLUSIONARY ZONING COULD BE IFFY BUT MANY TIMES INCLUSIONARY ONING IS A REQUIREMENT SO PORTION OF OUR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE WHAT THEY CALL BELOW MARKET RATE OUR BMR REQUIREMENT. AND THERE'S DIFFERENT -- FACTORS OF WHETHER IT'S VERY LOW. AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAVE. TIMES THINGS WE HAVE TO ANALYZE AND BE CONCERNED BUT AS A VERY VERY INCLUSIONARY ZONING IS A VERY COSTLY COMPONENT THAT IS BASE UNIT STRAPPED. USUALLY ON THE BACKS OF A HOME BUILDER LAND DEVELOPER. TO TO TAKE CARE OF EVEN THOUGH. I WE ALWAYS SAY IN OUR BUSINESS THAT WE WE BRING FORWARD SUPPLY AND AS YOU BRING FORWARD SUPPLY DEMAND IS THE SAME. ARE STAYS CONSTANT THEM PRICES SHOULD GO DOWN BUT INCLUSIONARY ZONING IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IT'S DIFFERENT IN MOST CITIES OF SOMEWHERE FROM. SOME CITIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE IT TO AS MUCH AS IS HIGHEST INSURANCE ALONG WITH LIABILITY WARRANTY IN DEFECT CLAIMS. SOME PRODUCTS LIKELY SHE HOMES WE BACK IN THE BUSINESS WE HAVE FOR WHILE BUILDING TOWNHOMES AND CONDOS BUT FOR MANY YEARS SINCE SOME BILLS ARE STILL TODAY. WON'T TOUCH THAT PRODUCT TYPE BECAUSE OF THE IT LITIGIOUS NATURE AND THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS SOME BUILDERS IS CAN YOU CAN SECURE INSURANCE TO ALLOW THEM TO BRING THAT FORWARD SO -- INSURANCE IS A DIFFICULT THING FOR US TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH BECAUSE OF THE MANA LAWSUITS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR INDUSTRY. INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY UNDERSTANDING IN IN THIS SITE IN THE AREA OF DOING BOTH THE ENTITLEMENTS IN THE LAND DEVELOPMENT WHAT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS WITH BIGGER DEVELOPMENT SECOND EVEN INCLUDE. I RECENTLY WAS PART OF A OF A FREEWAY OVERPASS AND SO YOU HAVE THE INTERCHANGES SOMETIMES TO THE EXTENT OF THE COMMUNITY CAN BE. SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS TO MAJOR MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. LOOKING AT MATERIALS CURRENTLY WITH TARIFFS WE ARE CONCERNED IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW WE'RE WATCHING LUMBER HAS BEEN SPIKING -- OFFERED THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR FINALLY TALK ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO AND IT SETTLED DOWN A LITTLE BIT. BUT LOOKING AT TERRACE UNDERSTAND WITH THE STEEL TARIFFS ARE GOING TO BE NEAR INDUSTRY AND THE REASON I'M GOING THROUGH ALL THIS IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ALL THE DIFFERENT RISK FACTORS THAT COME WITH. WHAT WE DO YEAH I IN BOTH LAND DEVELOPMENT HOME? LABOR LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WITH THE UNIONS OF FOCUSING ON OUR INDUSTRY -- POTENTIALLY LOOKING FOR PREVAILING WAGE -- THAT IS VERY VERY EXPENSIVE IF WE GET TO THE POINT HAVING TO PAY PREVAILING WAGES AS COMPARED. TO A NORMAL WAGES THAT OULD COME FROM WHETHER YOU'RE HIRING A UNION OR NON YOU. WHEN YOU GET TO PREVAILING WAGES I'VE EXAMPLES WHERE THE ADDED COST CAN BE SO EXORBITANT THAT THE PROJECT ITSELF JUST WON'T PENCIL AT ALL -- CLOSING COSTS REALTORS HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE -- HOME FINANCE ALL THESE THINGS WE NEED TO FOCUS ON TO MAKE SURE WE WORK WITH THE OUT REALTORS IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT ONLY WERE HIRING REALTORS TO SELL OUR HOMES BUT THEN THERE'S REALTORS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE BRINGING BUYERS TO US. AND SO WERE INTERFACING WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE OF REAL TRUE COMMUNITY. AND THOSE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF FACTORS THAT ARE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHATEVER ANALYZE IN A PROJECT IN THIS IS STILL A BIT OF A SUMMARY AN ALTERNATE OVER. TO DAVE STANCE AND NOW I THINK WE'LL GIVE THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT WE WANT TO REVIEW WITH YOU. CHAIRMAN IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS I'M GOING TO STEP BACK AND LET ANOTHER PANELIST COME AND I DID FAIL TO INTRODUCE SIDE JOHN NORMAN WITH BROOKE FIELD HOMES AND HE WILL BE. JOINING US THAT FOR ONE OF THE GREEN FIELD PROJECTS IN HIS COMPANY BUILT AND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE HOMES LAST YEAR SO THANK [inaudible] DATE. VERY GOOD DATA GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GLORIA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE -- IT'S MY PLEASURE ON BEHALF OF US CB I A TO A HELP TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU PRESENTED TO US ON HOW WE PROVIDE. WORKFORCE HOUSING INNER AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN ORDER BASICALLY HOUSING FOR THE METAL WHICH IRONICALLY OUR COMPANY IS A THIRD GENERATION FAMILY BUILDER DEVELOPER AND I WAS ALWAYS RAISED BY. BUILDING FOR THE MASSES THAT WAS WHAT MY FATHER ALWAYS TAUGHT ME AND AND THAT'S BEEN PRETTY MUCH OUR PRINCE ALONG. YOU'LL SEE ON MY FIRST PROJECT IT'S NOT A PROJECT FOR THE MASSES AND THAT IS JUST A BY PRODUCT OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WAYNE ADDRESSED -- IN THE BULLET POINTS -- WERE TRYING TO CONDENSE AND CONSOLIDATE THIS FOR YOU AS MUCH AS WE CANDIDATE DUE TO TIME IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES. AND SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ANYTIME WITH MAYOR ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR PANEL. THAT WHERE YOU WANT TO STOP US OR INTERRUPT US PLEASE THAT FEEL FREE TO DO SO. BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE THINGS THAT WOULD JUST BE OVER MY HEAD -- TO WITH THAT SO MANY OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BOIL DOWN INTO A QUICK SUMMARY AND OF COURSE WERE ALWAYS. AVAILABLE AFTER TODAY'S HEARING DIPS TO FOLLOW UP WITH ANYTHING THROUGH OUR CPA STAFF. THE FIRST DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS -- WAS THE COASTAL REGION WHICH A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT THAT OUR COMPANY DOES -- BOTH INFILL AND GREEN FIELD DEVELOPMENT IN THE COASTAL REGION FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE UTILIZING TODAY HIS -- AND OF SMALL TOWN ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SAN FRANCISCO. IT'S A TOWN THAT THAT OUR COMPANY HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- EARLY ON IN MY CAREER IN THE EIGHTIES AND AND THAT WE DEVELOPED ALL AROUND THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT THAT'S HOW I HAD SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IT AND ALMOST A TWENTY FIVE YEAR HISTORY WITH THIS PARTICULAR TEN ACRE PARCEL -- WE ULTIMATELY -- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OBTAIN APPROVAL FOR AN EIGHTEEN UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON THE*. IT'S AT LITTLE OVER TEN ACRES I'D INDICATED IN OUR AVERAGE HOME SIZES AROUND TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- THE HISTORY REALLY STARTS OFF -- FOR ME AND FOLLOWING IT BUILDING IN THE AREA AND TALKING IN THE FAMILY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND THEN THEM DECIDING THAT THEY WANTED TO SELL THE PROPERTY OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO. AND AT THE TIME -- UNDER THAT ARE TEN ZONING WHICH IS TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET PER LOT THIS SITE WOULD HAVE TYPICALLY YIELDED ABOUT FORTY UNITS. AND THE PURCHASE PRICE THAT THAT THEY ULTIMATELY WENT INTO CONTRACT TO SELL IT FOR IS LAME AND INDICATED. WAS ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE AS I MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO EVERYBODY ALWAYS THINKS REAL ESTATE CALIFORNIA GOES UP UP UP AND IT DOES FROM SOME REGARDS BUT THE ONLY THING IN OUR EQUATION THAT USUALLY. IS. FUNGIBLE OR FLEXIBLE IS HIS LAND WE REALLY CAN'T CONTROL ARE DIRECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS THE FEES A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WAYNE HAD INDICATED. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE ECONOMICS OF THESE DEALS THE LAND IS REALLY THE FINAL INGREDIENT AND BECOMING A VERY SMALL PORTION OF WHAT WE DO -- THIS PROJECT IS A VERY IRONIC BECAUSE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY LOOKED AT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A PROJECT THAT WAS BUILT FOR THE METAL. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKFORCE HOUSING AND A BEDROOM COMMUNITY -- THAT'S PLAYED A LOT A LOCAL JOBS AND WHAT NOT. AND JUST OVER TIME IS AS THINGS HAVE EVOLVED IN IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. PACIFIC COMMUNITY IT'S VERY TYPICAL IN EVERY TOWN IN CALIFORNIA -- THE ENTITLEMENTS BECAME MUCH MORE. MUCH MORE. COMPLEX IN THE YIELD AND THE COST YIELD ONE DOWN COSTS WENT UP SO WE'RE NOW AT ABOUT TWICE THE MEDIAN COST OF THE CALIFORNIA HOME. ON THIS PARTICULAR SITE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH WHICH IS ACTUALLY -- COMPUTER GENERATED RENDERING A TENANT SPEAKS TO A THOUSAND WORDS. AS YOU CAN SEE THE HOMES ON THE LEFT IN THE FEW HOMES UP IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER IN THAT BIG OPEN SPOT IN THE MIDDLE IS -- AS WAS. AN AREA THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN GREAT IN TERRACE LIKE MOST -- DEMOGRAPHY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WHERE YOU HAVE THAT INTRODUCED HOUSING YOU YOU WORK THAT INTO THE SITE DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN. AND IT REALLY SHOWS YOU AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF EFFORT AND SEVERAL DEVELOPERS THAT FAILED PRIOR TO US. HOWLE WHAT IT TAKES TO GET A PROJECT APPROVING CALIFORNIA TODAY THAT THIS BY A PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT WE WENT INTO THE CITY? KNOWING THE FAULTS FOR THE FAILURES OF ALL THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPERS STUDY IN THAT MEETING WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TALKING TO THAT THE CITY STAFF AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. AND WE CAME AND ORIGINALLY WITH THE PROJECT SIMILAR THIS IS A FEW MORE UNITS. BUT WE CAN HELP BUT SHAVING ANOTHER. 20% OFF OF THAT SO WHY HERE WE ARE -- THIS GIVES YOU THE CONTEXT OF WHERE THE PROJECTS IT'S IT'S IT'S WHOLLY AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT -- VERY INTENSE DEVELOPMENT ON ALL SIDES FROM MEDIUM TO HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL ON THE WESTSIDE COMMERCIAL. ON THE NORTH AND EAST SIDE AND THEN SOME MEDIUM TO LOW DENSITY HOUSING -- TO THE SOUTH IN MANY OF WHICH I BUILT OVER THE YEARS -- AND THIS SITE JUST REMAIN AND YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AERIAL MAP AGAIN THAT THE GROSS INEFFICIENCY OF THE TEN ACRE SITE. AND A LESS THAN HALF OF THE HOMES THAT ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE BEEN BUILT -- WHEN THIS PROPERTY ORIGINALLY I WAS GOING TO BE DEVELOPED TWENTY YEARS AGO AS I INDICATED THE PURCHASE PRICE ON IT WAS A? ROUGHLY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU TOOK THAT INTO TODAY'S AT NUMBERS AT TWO AND A HALF PERCENT INFLATION TO BE ABOUT SIX POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE OF THE SELLERS SITUATION HAD CHANGED AND THERE WERE SO MANY EVOLUTIONS A FAILURE. ALONG THE WAY WE'RE ABLE TO STRUCTURE PURCHASE AGREEMENT. UNDER A CONTRACT AGAIN AS LANDED INDICATED -- THAT WAS. VARIABLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOTS THAT WE GOT FROM FROM THE PROPERTY AND IT SCALED UP AND DOWN SO THAT WE COULD STILL REMAIN MOTIVATED TO TRY TO GARNER WILL THE MAXIMUM ENTITLEMENTS FROM THE JURISDICTION THAT WE COULD. THROUGH WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY. BUT THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE DISINCENTIVE EYES FROM FALLING THROUGH IN CLOSING SO ULTIMATELY WE CLOSED ON THIS PROPERTY THIS YEAR FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO. LESS THAN HALF OF TWENTY YEARS AGO. LESSON A THIRD OF WHAT TODAY'S NET PRESENT VALUE WOULD BE. BUT THE SELLERS WERE SO TIRED SEVERAL HAD PASSED AWAY THE ESTATE JUST WANTED TO LIQUIDATE THE PROPERTY IN WE WERE ULTIMATELY ABLE. TO FIND THE RIGHT FORMULA THAT WORK FOR EVERYBODY -- AND THE INTERESTING THING WITH OUR DEVELOPMENT IS -- PROCESS IS IT ALWAYS BOILS DOWN TO FEASIBILITY AND AND LIKE MOST BUSINESSES ITS TOP LINE BOTTOM LINE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE YOUR REVENUES WHAT WHAT EVEN AT AT THE END AND AND CAN YOU REMAIN. VIABLE AND PROFITABLE AND SO ALL THE ISSUES THAT WAYNE HAD BROUGHT UP WHICH WE CONSOLIDATED DRAMATICALLY FOR THIS PRESENTATION. REALLY WOULD GO IN TO A COST ANALYSIS WE HAVE TO TRY TO PREDETERMINE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE IDENTIFIED. AND PUT A VALUE TO IT NOW NORMALLY THIS IS ABOUT A TEN PAGE EXCELS BREAD SHE PERFORMA THAT WE ORIGINALLY WERE GOING TO BURDEN YOU WITH BUT WE THOUGHT YOU GLOSS OVER AND IN TWO SECONDS AND AND I WANT WORK WE BOILED IT DOWN. TO BASICALLY AT TEN LINE ITEM PERFORMER FOR YOU TO SHOW YOU KIND OF THE BASIC COMPONENTS -- BOTH NUMERICALLY AND WITH THE PIE CHARTS YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT GOES INTO CREATING A HOUSE. AND MAKING A HOUSE VIABLE AND THEN HOW YOU CAN ADJUST THAT TO TRY TO TWEAK IT TO MEET THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS. SO -- AGAIN ON ON THIS WHEN YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE ON THIS COASTAL PROJECT. OUR AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR THESE HOMES IS PROJECTED TO BE LITTLE SHORT OF A MILLION TO ONE ONE POINT ONE SIX MILLION DOLLARS -- IF YOU TAKE THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE LAND THAT I INDICATED THAT IT WORKS OUT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A LOT. THAT'S LESS THAN 10% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THE HOUSE. IN THE OLD DAYS YOU KNOW WE'VE WE PAID AS MUCH AS 2030% FOR LAND. BUT WEEK AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE COSTS IN THE DYNAMICS AND AND WHAT NOT IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE AND A LOT OF THESE AREAS THE LAND COSTS IS THE ONLY VARIABLE THAT WE CAN GET. TO A POINT THAT'S ADJUSTABLE SO TO SPEAK THAT WE CAN MAKE A PROJECT WORK. BUT OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WILLING SELLER AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE FACED WITH THEM CHALLENGES OF CREATING HOUSING TODAY'S WE CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT PLAN WITH THE RIGHT ZONING WITH THE RIGHT ECONOMICS. TO WORK WITH ALL THE OTHER FACTIONS COME INTO PLAY. SO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND IT WAS FAIRLY EFFICIENT TO ENTITLE LEADER ACTUAL REAL NUMBERS BY THE WAY THIS ISN'T HYPOTHETICAL THIS PROJECT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND AND CURRENTLY SELLING SO. IT JUST WAS A GOOD COASTAL EXAMPLE FOR ME. TO UTILIZE FOR YOU TODAY BECAUSE OF THE REALITY OF OF THE NUMBERS. THE ENTITLEMENT COSTS AND THIS ONE RELATIVELY LOW SOME PROJECTS -- WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER BUT TIME IS EVERYTHING IN CALPERS ALONG THE WAY LOS. PROBABLY THREE TIMES THIS IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE SPENT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BRING FORTH PROJECTS -- APPLICATIONS OF THE CITY IN THEY WOULD GET REJECTED THEM THEN WE LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES AND THEN MOVES WE CAME AND PRIDE THIRD OR FOURTH LINE -- BUT DAY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT'S LITTLE LESSON TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A HOME. SITE IMPROVEMENTS ON THIS ONE ARE HORRIFIC -- TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ARE ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COST. THIS SITE IMPROVEMENTS WILL YOU SAW FROM THAT SITE PLAN VERY INEFFICIENT PLANTS SINGLE LOADED STREETS. WHOLE LOT OFF SITE AND ONSITE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SO RELATIVELY FEW HOMES. IF YOU SIMPLY JUST LOOKED AT DOUBLING THE YIELD AND KEEPING THE SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS -- RELATIVELY THE SAME BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PUT IN THE SAME STREETS SAME IMPROVEMENTS. WE COULD HAVE DRAMATICALLY BROUGHT THAT COST DOWN FOR THESE UNITS WILL IMMEDIATELY THINGS LIKE THIS TAKE IT FROM BEING. THE MIDDLE CLASS OR WORKFORCE HOUSING PRODUCT AND IT PUSHES IT FURTHER AND FURTHER UP. THE THE CHAIN OF BEING -- MORE OF AN EXECUTIVES DIALER MANY MORE EXPENSIVE HOME FRANKLY AND DOESN'T MEET THE MIDDLE. MIDDLE LAST CLASS DESIGNATION. PERMITS HERE AGAIN RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE FROM ONE LANE AND INDICATED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- AND SOME OF THAT IS THAT FOR REASONS THAT I'LL GET INTO LATER -- WE DIDN'T PAY AN INCLUSIONARY FEE HERE -- SCHOOL FEES ARE RELATIVELY MODEST BECAUSE IT'S AN INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND THERE WE OBVIOUSLY ARE WHO FEES CAN BECOME A HUGE VARIABLE FOR US AND IN EITHER WITH LEGISLATION THAT CHANGES. OR CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT ARISE AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE NUMBERS SOMETIMES IT'S IS DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS TO BUILD A HOUSE BECAUSE YOU CAN SAIL IT'S A FEW THOUSAND HERE FEW THOUSAND THERE BUT WHEN HE KEEPS GOING THE WRONG WAY. YOU'LL SEE EVEN ON THIS PROJECT EVEN THOUGH WE WENT THROUGH ALL THREE STAGES WE DID THE ENTITLEMENT. WE DID A LAND DEVELOPMENT AND WHERE THE MERCHANT BUILDER BUILDING THE HOMES. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS STILL BELOW THE INDUSTRY MINIMUM BUT WE WERE SO FAR COMMITTED TO IT -- WE DECIDED TO GO FORWARD HOPING FOR THE BEST BUT THAT THE BUILDER AND MATT PRETAX. THAT'S BELOW THE MINIMUM STANDARD THAT THAT AN FDIC INSURED BANK WILL GENERALLY GO INTO A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT BECAUSE OF ALL THE RISKS THAT WAYNE IDENTIFIED. IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG THE NUMBERS CAN YOU IMMEDIATELY A ROAD THAT BUILDER NET. AND SO THE BANK DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE OVER THE PROJECT AND TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO SO -- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP PROJECTS WHETHER WERE. PUBLIC OR PRIVATE LIKE OURSELVES. THE AND THAT'S REASONABLY SUSTAINABLE FOR THE RISK AND THE OTHER THINGS -- INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. BY THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS AGAIN. PRETTY TYPICAL 25% BUT THINGS LIKE TERRORISTS LABOR SHORTAGES ALL KINDS OF THINGS CAN JUST SWING THOSE DRAMATICALLY AND WE REALLY HAVE TO GO INTO THESE PROJECTS BEING ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR COST LUMBER TARIFFS THAT JUST WENT INTO EFFECT. IS ADDED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE COST OF THIS HOUSE WE DON'T GET ANYTHING MORE FOR IT WE CAN'T SELL IT FOR MORE. EDGES LOWERS THE PROBABILITY. SELLING COSTS VERY BASIC I NEW HOMES IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO RE SALE. AND THE SOFT COSTS ARE EVERYTHING THAT IT TAKES TO PUT A DEVELOPMENT TOGETHER THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS. OUR OFFICE JEAN AN OVERHEAD -- POLL ALL THE OTHER -- BACKROOM BACK OFFICE JOB SITE SUPERVISION YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ALL LUMPED INTO ONE FIFTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT IS RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF INDUSTRY NORMS -- DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT AND THEN OF COURSE FINANCE COSTS. SO YOU CAN SEE HERE ON A PRE TAX IT COMES OUT TO JUST BELOW 10% DOING ALL THREE PHASES OF THE DEVELOPMENT AN AFTER TAX. WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT A 5% RETURN SO WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE THAT WE HAVE IF EVERYTHING GOES PERFECTLY TO REINVEST IN HAVING THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING ANOTHER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOREIGN. SO THAT'S OUR GOAL FOR SURVIVAL. AND I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S MANY OTHER FACTORS WITH THE INCLUSIONARY AND DENSITY THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT JUST LITTLE. THINGS WITH DANCE IF YOU DOUBLE THE DANCE REALLY BROUGH AND THE IN THE AFFORDABILITY ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS MAYBE 3040% FROM A MILLION TO DOWN THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND INCLUSIONARY HOUSING CAN JUST BE A DISASTER. FOR THE PROJECT OUT LIKE THAT BECAUSE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS IT'S A SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUSE SUBSIDIES SO -- LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SHARE MORE WITH YOU BUT I KNOW MY TIME IS LIMITED. IF I MAY. BECAUSE I WANNA KNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE OF US SOME NUMBERS BERMAN SANTIAGO AND AND IS THEN THE SOME NUMBER FRIEDMAN WHO I BELIEVE WILL COME BACK IN A MOMENT. IF WE MAY TAKE A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS WHICH I THINK SOME OF THE FINANCIAL PRINCIPLES WILL. APPLY ACROSS THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS I THINK THAT THE DIGITAL SCENARIOS ARE REALLY MEANT TO BE CONTEXT SENSITIVE RIGHT -- IN A DIFFERENT ONE BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES HAS QUESTIONS BUT JUST TO KIND OF TOP WHITE IT FOR FOLKS -- IS HE SAID THESE HOUSES SOLD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE ARE THE POSSIBLY IN SEOUL SO THE ONE POINT ONE AND MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE IS WHAT FOLKS ARE SELLING THESE PROPERTIES THESE HOMES FOR TODAY RIGHT. AND WHAT I THINK IS OFTEN LOST ON FOLKS WHEN THEY THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES ACTUALLY BUILD A HOUSE THEY USUALLY JUST START THINKING ABOUT THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION RIGHT THERE THINKING ABOUT STICKS AND BRICKS AND THAT KIND OF STUFF. WHICH IS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT RIGHT. ABOUT THEN THIS THIS SLIDE IS REALLY DID ILLUSTRATE ALL THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT. YOU KNOW DEPEND HOW GAUGE JORDAN'S PROCESS -- YOU MAY NOT BE EXACTLY WHERE OF CRACKED CORRECT NOW UNDERSTOOD THE PROJECT THIS WASN'T SUBJECT TO PUT WAS A SUBJECT PREVAILING WAGE NO SIR CARVE OUR APPEAL A OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE NONE AT ALL. AND THAT'S ALWAYS A RUN BY WHAT TIME OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND UNDERSTANDABLY Y. WITH ONE ENCOURAGE JOBS THAT ARE IN THAT IN THAT AREA WHAT'S IN TIME THE RUB AGAINST WHAT THAT MAY DO TO SELL COST. UNITS A TUG IN THE PUSH AND PULL THE DECISION MAKERS LIKE US HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT THIS A MILLION FELL PRICES ABSENT THAT PARTICULAR REQUIREMENT -- SHE'D JUST HIT A IN A CLOSE RACE OF EVEN WITHOUT THOSE REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL TALKING WELL BEYOND WHAT ANYONE CAN WHAT AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD RIGHT THAT'S FOR AUNT THAT WITH REGARD TO THAT THE SIZE OF THE UNIT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. HOMES WHEN WHEN THEY ADDITIONAL THAT VISUAL DENSITY WAS LIKE FORTY UNITS THAT WE SAID. WHAT DOES WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS SIZE WOULD DAY ABSOLUTELY IF I IF I HAD THE ABILITY I WOULD HAVE GONE INTO MORE DETAIL BUT IF WE WERE TO BUILD THIS IS A FORTY UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY THE AVERAGE SIZE? AVERAGE SIZE YEARS TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED WE PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN AROUND. TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND WHEN YOU TAKE THE REDUCTION OF ALL THOSE LINE ITEM COSTS IN THE DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS. WE COULD HAVE PROBABLY SOLD AT HOME FOR AROUND [inaudible] SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND INTERESTING WHICH IS STILL HIGHER RELATIVE. TO THE MIDDLE FOR THE MEDIAN IN CALIFORNIA AROUND. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT IT'S MUCH LARGER OF A POPULATION SEGMENT WHERE HOUSING IS SO BADLY NEEDED IN THIS REGION. YEAH FOR PUTS A FEW MORE PEOPLE IN THE NEXT THAN THAN ONE POINT ONE MILLION AYE CORRECT NOW THAT'S THAT WOULD USE COSTS IS EVEN TRUE. EVEN IF YOU HAD TO SORT OF LEVEL OFF THE POT ARTIST THE TOPOGRAPHY SO EVEN I MENTIONED THAT'S NOT CHEAP -- CLOSE SO EVEN THAT WE STILL HAVE A SEVERELY REDUCED. COST MEAN ABSENT YOU SAID SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND IS ABOUT WHICH IS. THAT WE WILL HOLD ANY PARTICULAR FIGURE WITHOUT A BALLPARK RIGHT -- AND THAT WAS A SORT OF A OF A GOING TO THE POLITICAL PROCESS OF SEE COUNCIL HEARINGS COMMUNITY CHARAX THAT KIND OF STUFF THAT GOT YOU TO THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF THIS ULTIMATELY WAS THAT'S CORRECT INTERESTING. WHAT THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND THEN AGAIN I HOPE IT BECAUSE ANY QUESTIONS AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR TIME AND PRESENTS -- IT WE OFF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUTSMALLER UNITS CLOSER AND NOW ONE OF THINGS I JUST CARE FACILITIES IN THE INDUSTRY IS SMALLER NECESSARILY CHEAPER AND I MEAN I I WHEN LOOKING AT ALL THE NON CONSTRUCTION COSTS THAT GO INTO THE FINAL SALES PRICE. YOU KNOW ARE WE ON THE RIGHT TRACK FOR REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW SMALLER HOMES -- CONDENSER UNITS A MICRO UNITS THINGS THAT NATURE ARE IS THAT ABOUT SIX OF ONE HALF OF THE OTHER BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE FEES ARE STILL HAVING. TO BUILD THE ROADS ETCETERA. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE? A HIGH IT WAS A BILL THERE'S A RULE OF THUMB THAT I I KNEW THAT QUESTION WAS GONNA COME UP AND AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE WILL PROBABLY HAVE DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR A IT IT. IT DEPENDS OBVIOUSLY IS IS THE TRUE ANSWER BUT IN MOST CASES YES ONE ONE WE HAVE. SITES THAT ARE GROSSLY UNDER UTILIZED LIKE THIS IT DRAMATICALLY CHANGES THE OVERALL COST BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE. PROCESSING THAT I I CAN PROCESS EIGHTEEN LOTS AS EASILY AS I CAN TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY LOTS I CAN. I HAVE THE SAME STAFF THE SAME OVERHEAD -- THE SAME RELATIVE EFFORT THAT GOES INTO IT AND THEN WHEN YOU CAN REDUCE. EVERYONE OF THESE LINE ITEMS IS JUST BE MORE EFFICIENT IT'S KINDA LIKE THE FOR HER THE GM MODEL OF BUILDING CARS. YOU YOU BUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING BY EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. NOT BY TRYING TO BUILD SEMI CUSTOM HOMES. AND AND SO DENSITY DOES HELP. TO A CERTAIN LEVEL WHAT ONCE YOU GET AND IS SUPER DANCE STUFF WHERE YOU'RE GONE FROM THREE TO SIX TO TWELVE STORIES. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT LAYERS OF ECONOMICS IN THAT WHERE THEY INCREASE INCREMENTAL DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS GET. SO MUCH GREATER IT'S IT'S TIED TO A REAL ESTATE VALUE AGAIN BUT FOR THE MOST PART. WITH THAT THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT WERE REFERRING TO AND THAT'S IT WOULD HAVE HELPED IMMENSELY INTIMATELY INVOLVED QUESTION IS I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE SAY BACK WHEN WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR SMALL UNITS OF THERE'S NOT A MARKET FOR THAT BUT YOU COULD HAVE SOLD THESE. JUST AS EASILY AT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AS YOU COULD AT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET MUCH EASIER THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE DEMAND IS SO MUCH GREATER FOR THOSE BECAUSE AGAIN. YOU'RE BUILDING FOR THE MASSES AS MY FATHER TAUGHT ME YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO PICK OFF THAT UPPER AND THEY GET A HIGHER PROFIT NET PROFIT PER UNIT HERE TRYING. TO CREATE HOUSING WHERE THERE'S A BIGGER MARKET A BIGGER POOL WHICH IS THE MIDDLE. WE TALK ABOUT SMALL A DETACHED. I'M TRYING TO DEVELOP RIGHT NOW IN THAT SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT. PRODUCT AMOUNT MOUND HOUSE WITH FOUR PROPERTIES THAT WERE ZONED FOR ATTACHED WITH THE OR DUPLEXES OR TOWNHOMES. AND I'M WORKING WITH THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW TO GET ALL REZONED A SMALL LOT DETACHED. BECAUSE THE COST NOW FOR DELIVERING THAT IS SO MUCH CHEAPER. AND THEN IT'S ALSO HAD IN THE PRICE POINT OF AFFORDABILITY THAT WOULD BE BEST FOR THAT MARKET. AND SO THAT REALLY IS THE KIND OF THE SWEET SPOT ANOTHER GOOD THING TO FOCUS ON IS IS A GRANNY FLATS OR MULTI GEN HOUSING WHERE WE CAN ADD A UNIT TO A SET A STANDARD SO ELECT ON THESE HOMES THAT. DAVE TALKING ABOUT HERE THOSE HOMES COULD HAD A AT IT EXHILARATING UNIT. THAT YOU CAN EITHER RAN ORG EFFORT. BACK THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO REALLY FOCUS ON FOR FOUR IN THE STATE [inaudible] COOL [inaudible] A MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OF BEFORE I MOVE ON THE NEXT. NINE SURE PRESENCE AND THAT ONE THING CHAIR GLORIA -- FOR ORGANIZING TODAY'S HEARING ARE PRESENT -- THE SILICON VALLEY WHERE I WISH I COULD BUY HOME FOR ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- AND AND BUT AND THIS IS A CRISIS IT'S AFFECTING THE ENTIRE STATE AND ITS LARGELY A SUPPLY PROBLEM. THAT WE HAVE SO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT. AND EXPLAINING SOME THE COSTS OF JUST GOING BACK TO THE THE ABBREVIATED PRO FORMA THE PROVIDED FOR US -- SO THIS DID NOT INCLUDE PREVAILING WAGE IT ALSO I'M ASSUMING DID NOT INCLUDE -- IBM ARE. NO. OH IF IF IF IF YOU DID HAVE MORE UNITS PER ACRE DO YOU THINK THOUGH. THAT THE SUICIDE PERMITS WERE GONE DOWN PER UNIT BUT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO PAY MORE FOR THE LAND. POSSIBLY IT WOULD TO WHICH BROUGHT IT WOULDN'T OF EVEN DOUBT BUT IT. WOULD HAVE BEEN A FACTOR -- GOING TO LABOR BECAUSE WAS ALSO WOULD -- HAVING THIS SUMMER SO IT SPOKE ABOUT -- ARE YOU GUYS FACING A LABOR SHORTAGE AT ALL ARE YOU SEEING THAT ESPECIALLY NO. LA FIRES AND DOCTOR WOODS DISTRICT IN MY AND THOSE ARE ON THAT -- BY IS THAT IMPACTING YOUR ABILITY. TO TO BUILD THAT LABOR SHORTAGES AND AND TRAIN LABOR. DRAMATICALLY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE EVEN EVEN IF WE DO GET A PROJECT TO PROVE NOW. AND WERE SUCCESSFUL AND BRING IT TO THE MARKETPLACE TS STATE HAS MUCH LONGER TO DELIVER THAT PRODUCT WHICH THEN ANALYZE WITH INCREASING OUR DIRECT CONSTRUCTION COSTS USER LABOR COSTS ARE GOING UP IN INCREASES ARE FINANCING COSTS BECAUSE IT'S BURKE TRACKING THE TIME TO DO. IT -- INCREASE JUST ABOUT EVERY LINE ITEM THEIR EXCEPT FOR POSSIBLY SELLING BECAUSE I DIDN'T AND SO WE THIS FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER I'VE BEEN BUILDING IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS WHERE WE WERE IT. THAT THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE CRISIS HERE AND THEN YOU MENTIONED AS A MEASURE OF HOW QUICKLY THAT. THE LATE IN THE LUMBER TARIFFS ADDED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT WAS OUT ON THIS PROJECT YEARS BROWN DID IT REALLY. SO. YOU'RE GETTING KIND OF SIDES -- THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME PERSIA. THINKING RESPONDED. THIRD EDITION QUESTION MISTER WOULD YOU HAVE TO PLEASE. A POPULAR ONE APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE BUT AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE QUITE NOT SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT I HAVEN'T AT KIND OF AN INTEREST IN THE COPY PARK. AND THAT WAS YOU CORRECT YOUR FOR YOUR COMPANY UP WE WERE ONE OF MANY WHEN I MADE THIS ALL THAT PROBLEM YES RIGHT AND SO THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT FOR A PROJECT LIKE THAT WHERE IT WILL LAND WAS ALREADY -- DEVOID OF EVERYTHING -- THE PADS WERE ALL YOU KNOW OR THE OF THIS THE SO IT WAS ALL CLEAN AND EVERYTHING. SO SORTING AREA LIKE THAT WHERE YOU'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY WE'VE GOT -- AND SEEK WASN'T IN THE WAY BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT -- THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO REBUILD SPECIFICALLY ARE PROJECT LIKE THAT WHERE IT'S ALMOST READY MADE. WHAT WHAT WAS IT THAT THAT KEPT YOU FROM DOING A PROJECT LIKE THAT? THE M. IT YEAH AND I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING I THINK I THINK OUR COMPANY -- PART OF OUR PHILOSOPHY IS HELPING THE COMMUNITY AND AND WE HAD EVERY INTENTION OF AFTER BEING TAPPED -- TO GO AND SEE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP. AND PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT. HOME BUILDERS WERE PRODUCTION HOMEBUILDERS AND APPLY THAT. BUILDING A LARGE CHUNK OF HOMES AT A TIME LIKE COFFEE PARKED AT THE HELP RESPOND. WHEN WE GOT STARTED UP THERE DOING OUR INVESTIGATION AND THERE WERE THERE WERE A FEW THINGS ON THE SITE DEVELOPMENT SIDE THAT WERE? KIND OF BIG UNKNOWNS WITH STREET WITH SUN. WATER AND AND OTHER UTILITY ADEQUACY BECAUSE CODES OF CHANGE WITH FIRE SPRINKLERS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD AND AND THOSE KIND OF THINGS IN THOSE ANSWERS EARLY ON WEREN'T THERE THEY MIGHT BE THERE BY NOW. BUT ARE OUR MAIN ISSUE. AND WHY WE DECLINED. PURSUE IT WITH THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS INSTEAD OF WHERE WE GOING TO BUY ONE PIECE A LAND WE BUILD ALL THE HOMES. WAS BECAUSE WE HAD NO WAY TO PROTECT OUR BECAUSE AND WHEN WHEN WE WENT UP THERE WE WENT TO EVERYONE OF OUR TRADE PARTNERS WHETHER THEY WERE UNION NON UNION WHATEVER IT WAS AND ALL OF OUR SUPLIERS AND WE SAID OKAY LISTEN WE WE HAVE. TO REBUILD THESE HOMES WANTED TO FIFTY OR A HUNDRED AT A TIME. AND WHAT'S GONNA TAKE WHAT DO WHAT DO WE HAVE TO GET FROM HERE TO PAY HERE YOUR LABOR GO. TO THE NORTH BAY TO REBUILD THESE HOMES. AND THE ANSWER WAS WE CAN'T OR WE WON'T EVER WE CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BE FACED. WITH A BUNCH OF DISAPPOINTED HOMEOWNERS A YEAR OR TWO DOWN THE ROAD WHERE THEY SETTLED WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY FOR ACTS. AND I'M HAVING TOPAY AX PLUS TO BUILD THEIR HOME. BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THE COST AND THEN THEY CAN'T FINISH THEIR HOME. I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER TO LET THEM KNOW I'M SORRY WE CAN'T PREDICT YEAR AND COST. AS MUCH AS THEY WANTED US TO SIGN A CONTRACT. AND GIVE THEM A FIXED FEE AND I WOULD LIKE TO UNDER NORMAL STANCE POSSIBLY WE COULD. BUT WE COULDN'T AND I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT GUY IN THE NEWSPAPER COUPLE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHERE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF UPSET HOMEOWNERS. WHEN WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE? AND WE FIND OUT THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO FINISH THE WHOLE. SO THAT REALLY WAS THE ISSUE WE COULD NOT GET LABOR TO GO UP THERE ON A ON A LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION. AT ANY PRICE. PETS WE'VE WE'VE WHY I'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS THAT THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID WELL THERE IS AN ADEQUATE LABOR SUPPLY AND AND AND AND AND YOU WERE ABLE. TO THAT WHAT THAT WASN'T THE WAY YOU SAW IT FROM YOUR PER. AND AND I WENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY REFERRING THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE LABOR SUPPLY. AND WHEN I REALLY ASK THEM TO SIGN A CONTRACT WITH ME BEFORE I WOULD SIGN A CONTRACT WITH THE HOMEOWNERS A WHEN. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION AND I THOUGHT THAT THE HOMEOWNERS DESERVE TO KNOW IN ADVANCE SO THEY CAN MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES. WE BUILD HOMES FOR A LIVING. THEY NEED TO GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES AND THE I JUST THOUGHT THAT DRAGGING THEM OUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AND UNPREDICTABLE ON FEASIBLY FINANCIAL SITUATION WASN'T THE FAIREST THING TO DO. FOR EVEN THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING FOR ALL OF US [inaudible] THANK YOU. JIM IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT NIGHT WE THEORETICALLY. THIRTY MORE MINUTES OR SO -- I LEAVE A TV IF AS EFFICIENT WAS WE'LL SEE HOW EFFICIENTLY DESTRUCTION INDUSTRY AS OTHER MAYBE PLOW THROUGH -- THE ORDER THAT YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO SKIP OVER ONE OF THE SCENARIOS THAT'S FINE -- TOO BUT ALTERNATE ACTIVE FOR THE NEXT PRESENTATION. MY NAME'S JOHN NORMAN I'M WITH A BURKE FEEL RESIDENTIAL WE HAVE OUR FOR OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THREE OF THOSE ARE -- COASTAL AND I OF THE INLAND SACRAMENTO REGION SO WE WILL SEE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THAT MISTER SAMSON TO STE. OUR PRESENT AND WEBER AREN'T GOING TO BE PRESENTING-- BARB COMPANY DOES MASTER PLANS WE DO INFILL WE DO MAKES YOU SORT OF THINK THAT LAME TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ON WE'D DO A WHOLE RANGE OF THINGS A WORLD SPEAKING ABOUT. TURN THE KEYS OVER TO HOMEOWNERS IN TODAY. OF THIS PROJECT NEWS -- THREE THOUSAND UNIT PRO SACRAMENTO REGION ARE TAKEN -- MICROCOSM OF OUT OF ABOUT A HUNDRED UNITS TO SEE WHAT THAT WOULD TAKE TO DELIVER WERE IN BED R. COSTA WORK IN PROGRESS BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A FINAL PERMITS YEAH. I BEEN -- I'VE BEEN UP THIS ON THIS PROJECT FOR FOURTEEN YEARS OR PEOPLE FIVE YEARS BEFORE. I GOT STARTED ON IT WE STILL HAVE ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF TO MEET TWO YEARS TO GO BEFORE WE CAN BREAK GROUND. SO AROUND AND I I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST STARTED ON THIS PROJECT -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS USER BUYER AND WE REALIZED AT THAT TIME THAT THEY WERE ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WELL DON'T GROW MOST THIRTY SO. WE WOULD IN THE HOME BY MARKET -- I'VE -- AND BAY AGAIN -- YOU KNOW THE LAND PORTION OF IT IS LAND TALKED ABOUT BEFORE WE WE DEAL WITH WE LONG TERM DEALS ON THIS AND WE WANT OFF THE EDGE OF THOSE DEALS AND I'VE GOTTEN GOOD AT TERROR. RENEGOTIATING THOSE TO MAKE IT TO THIS POINT B. IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AND STILL HAVE A PROJECT TO TALK ABOUT -- BEN AND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK -- TO THE SMALLER MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN COST AROUND AND AND SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MASTER PLAN BY DEVELOPED AN AXIOM IN LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT ARE BENT ON OVERTIME. AND IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER IF IT'S FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A THOUSAND UNITS OR TEN THOUSAND UNITS. IF THEY ALL COST ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ENTITLE. I DON'T KNOW WHY DOES IT JUSTICE. AND AND THE MOST THE SMALLER MAY YES ON THE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF A GEOGRAPHIC SENSITIVITY TO THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT PARTICULAR MARKET. POWER AND THAT'S KIND OF WORLD DO WE GO NEXT MESS -- CLOSING THE THIS THE SITE PLAN FOR WELL FOR THE PROJECT AS MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE RUNNING THROUGH IT ANOTHER ONE OF THE THINGS IT'S A COMMON. THEME OF NO WHERE ARE THE BIG COSTS THAT HIT A PROJECT AND AND AND A BULLS FOUNDER ECONOMIES OF SCALE MUCH LIKE MISTER SIMPSON WAS TALKING ABOUT ON A ON A DIFFERENT SCALE. AROUND. THE COST OF THE MAJOR ROADS RUNNING THROUGH THERE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAD NO FIVE HUNDRED UNITS SIR. FIVE THOUSAND UNITS YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO BUILD A BIG ROAD THAT RUNS THROUGH IT SO. THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE [inaudible] TOM [inaudible] ENVIRONMENTAL NEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL OUR COSTS ARE ON THIS PROJECT IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ACRES GROSS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ACRES THAT'S NOT DEVELOPED AND WE'RE STILL HAVE TO GO OUT AND SECURE SIX HUNDRED FORTY ACRES OF OFFSITE MITIGATION. SUPPORT IS SO THINK ON YOUR ROOF. TUNE IN TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES WHATEVER DEVELOPMENT AREAS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND SECURE SORRY I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE PRESENTATION I WANT TO BE SURE UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE YOU SAY A HUNDRED UNITS BUT THEN YOU JUST MENTION A COUPLE THOUSAND SO ARE. USES A PART OF A CONTINUATION OF AN OLDER DEVELOPMENT IS NOT WHAT YOUR NO SIR BRAND NEW DEVELOPMENT IT'S PART IT'S BROUGH WOULD BE WHAT ONE HUNDRED UNITS WOULD BE WITH IN THE THREE THOUSAND UNITS DEVELOP. SO YOU DEVELOP THREE THOUSAND ONE TIME KNOW. IT TAKES A LITTLE TO THE DECADE TO DECADES TO TO ABSORB ALL THE THREE THOUSAND THE FIRST ONE HUNDRED I GOT THE SUIT. RATS WITH LIKE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS WILL HAVE A UNDERSTANDING SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACREAGE FOR THE TH THE WHOLE BUILD UP TO THREE THOUSAND OUT MAYBE. MAYBE I SHOULD EXPLAIN ON THE MASTER PLAN -- WE HAVE TWO OF THE THREE THOUSAND FORUMS ARE BETTER WITH THEM AT NEW PERCENT SINCE TALK ABOUT ONE PRODUCT LINE FOR EIGHTEEN UNITS IT. FOUND WE HAVE WILL HAVE ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO SIX MAYBE EVEN MORE PRODUCT LINES RUNNING CONCURRENTLY EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW SMALL MULTI FAMILY UNITS BROWN. TO GO LARGER AND I WOULDN'T SAY A LARGE. A BIT LARGER HOMES IN THERE THAT MIGHT BE UP TO FIVE THOUSAND MAYBE SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT ON THE VERY TOP. AND MY LAST QUESTION SO WHAT YOU GET ON WITH IT IS THEIR COMMERCIAL MIXED IN THERE AS WELL AS TO WHERE THEIR SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS. SAME QUESTION FOR THE ONE MY I FLIP TO HEAD TO LOOK AT THE OTHER PROJECT AS WELL SO OFFICE IN PLACE YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- WE STARTED THIS MASTER PLAN WITH ALBERT PARK CENTER BECAUSE WE CALL IT THEM AND PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY WE WE BORROW SET UP A SERIES PARKS HOW THOSE CONNECT TOGETHER. AND AND WE GET THE ROADS LAST SO HOW WOULD LIVE THERE'S ABOUT COMMERCIAL INNER SOLAR DAY WE HAVE MIXED USE. THERE'S SCHOOL FIRE STATION WITNESSES SO WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING FORWARD. SO THIS HUNDRED UNITS IS. ONE OF THE ABOUT TYPES OF PRODUCT LINES THAT WOULD EXIST IN HERE. TAKE A TIME BUT IT WILL SHOW YOU SIX DIFFERENT WHAT'S. AND THIS EXEMPLIFIES AMERICA GO THROW THE DETAIL ON HERE BUT JUST A COUPLE OF HIGHLIGHTS AND AND AND THE THOUGHT PROCESS ON THIS. PERMIT FEES THAT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR MEMBER AND PERMIT FEES IT'S OVER HERE. TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ABOUT IS SCHOOL FEES BAD NEWS A HUGE HUGE HIT AMOUNT WAS -- BECAUSE THE LEVEL FOR YOU GROW LEVEL THREE FEES AND AND SUCH THAT HAVE HAVE FAR COME TO THE FOR LACK OF FINANCING FOR SCHOOLS. AND BASICALLY THAT'S KEEPING THIS PROJECT UP ON BLOCKS UNTIL SOMEONE. GETS ALL -- THE OTHER -- ITEMS ARE AND WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON ON AN OVERALL BASIS A LOT OF THE DEVELOPMENT BUT YOU SEE VERSUS A HOMEBUILDING THAT YOU SEE GOING ON IN THE REGION. IS ON OLD LOCKS HOLDING WHAT'S IT WILL PERSONALLY DEVELOPER. ARE GREAT IT INFRASTRUCTURE. THIRD ROUND BUYERS FROM ONE RESPONDED OUT OF BAY TO CREATE NEW LOTS IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND SO SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT YOU SEEN FOR SITE IMPROVEMENTS THESE IN PUBLIC BECAUSE HAVE ALL BEEN WIPED OFF THE BOOKS. ON THE EXISTING -- POWER PROJECTS IN A MOVE FORWARD -- IN TERMS OF THE VERB PRICING AGAIN I DON'T GO THROUGH ALL THAT DETAIL ON THIS BUT GOOD NET CREEK TSONGAS WAS NEGATIVE FIVE POINT 6%. SO WE DON'T HAVE AN AFTER TAX NUMBER ON HERE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T CLEARED A HURDLE. AND I BY WAY OF COMPARISON. OVER THAT NINETEEN YEARS WE DONT JUST CAME OUT OF THE GREAT RECESSION. AND I CAN TELL YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT RECESSION SHOULD WE CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT WILL IT TAKE SO LONG. THAT YOU CAN NEVER STOPAND WE'RE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH CYCLES SO WERE. WORKING ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THINGS WILL IMPROVE AND THAT WILL WORK HARDER AND WORK ON OUR SITE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA ALWAYS OTHER THINGS. PRICING ARE WILL YEARS MOOD THE LIMITING FACTOR ON YOUR THE FORMER NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO YOU SEE OVER THERE. ARE FELIZ. IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION THAT HAVE THEM AND WOULD BE WORKFORCE FRIENDLY. BUT WE CAN'T DELIVER IT WITH ALL THE COSTS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US TODAY SO. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT FOUR NINETY FOUR THOUSAND IS BASICALLY THE PRE RECESSION PRICING THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE CYCLE SACRAMENTO REGION. UNFORTUNATELY THE FEES A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT BECAUSE LABOR COSTS ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE HAS GONE UP IT IS NOT STOP INCREASING SO THE GAP [inaudible] CLOSE SO. THIS PROJECT MY JOHN. IS TO GET READY. TO DEPLOY. WHEN THE DYNAMICS ARE THERE EITHER REDUCING COSTS OR PRICE INCREASES BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY LISTEN MARKET DEUCES IN SUSPENSE UNTIL WE GET. I FIGURED OUT ONE AT A KNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE OF A SOME MEMBER AG AGO CURRY I THINK YOU FOR COMING -- TAKING A QUICK QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE IF THERE'S ANY JUST MAYBE TO BELABOR THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING -- IS THAT RIGHT NOW THIS IS THIS IS A NICE -- WAITING FOR MARKET THAT THE MARKET PRICES TO CATCH UP WITH THE COSTS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WE'RE CONTINUING TO PROCESS. FOR THE ALMOST PERMITS TO HAVE IT READY THAT'S MY JOBS HAVE IT READY. BECAUSE WHEN WHEN THE NEED IS THERE WHEN THE PRICING IS THERE AND AND THE THE ABSORPTION HERE OR THERE. I CAN'T SAY LET'S GO START A PROJECT AND I'LL SEE YOU IN TWENTY YEARS. THEIR ARM IT'S PUT THE SWITCH SHOULD BE READY TO GO BY UNDENIABLY THE NEED IS THERE BUT THE PRICING THAT'S NOT. I AM GONNA PERMITTING PROCESS SIDE I FEEL DIMENSION THE FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESSES ARE GREAT WHEN FACTOR THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AS WELL. ABOVE OUR PAY GRADE HERE THE SPECTRAL. OKAY WILL MOVE TO THAT'S PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR TIME CONSTRAINTS I THINK WE'LL MOVE TO THE FOURTH PROJECT THAT'S OKAY UNLESS VENTURE -- WITH THE PROJECT. ABOUT THAT -- INFILL NEXT DENSITY THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AS YOU CAN SEE. IN THE TRI VALLEY -- THIS THE PROJECT IS SHE HOMES. HAS BUILT WE'VE HAD IT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE FAMILY THIS IS THE PICTURE OF THE BEAUTIFUL REC CENTER THAT WE BUILT -- THE FABLESS COMMUNITY IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR UNITS -- AND IT IS ALL [inaudible] TOWN HOMES -- FOR DIFFERENT PRODUCT TYPES OF THE GET IN TOTAL AT SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT FLOOR PLANS ALL RANGING FROM. TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE FEET TO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SQUARE FEET -- IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECT FOR US -- TO GET TO THIS POINT TOOK MANY YEARS OF THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS ACTION THIS IS IN THE CITY A LIVER MORE. NOW THIS IS JUST THE SITE PLAN YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE REC CENTER LIES IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE -- TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF THE DYNAMICS -- BEFORE I GO THROUGH THE PRO FORM -- THIS PROJECT. WHERE WE ACTUALLY OWN THE LAND SO THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF TAKING IT FROM? PLANNING THROUGH DEALING WITH ALL OF THE CITY DYNAMICS GOING THROUGH REGULATORY. CONCERNS DOING ALL THE LAND DEVELOPMENT ULTIMATELY BILL IN THE HOMES AND I HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED UNITS LEFT TO BUILD -- THIS PROJECT HAD A COUPLE MAJOR HURDLES THAT ALL THIS USES SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE WORK THROUGH. CITY LIVERMORE WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY HAS WITH THE BECAUSE SCENIC CORPS OR IT'S A VIEW CORRIDOR THEY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN YOUR ON THE FREEWAY ON A ON AN ANGLE. THE HILLS BEHIND WHAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY THE HOMES. THE DENSITY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PRESCRIBED FOR THE PROPERTY WAS IN CONFLICT WITH THE VIEW QUARTERS IF YOU WERE A BILL THAT THAT DENSITY. WHICH WAS TWENTY FOUR UNITS THE ACRE THE HEIGHT OF THOSE BUILDINGS WOULD PIERCE THROUGH THE THIS. VIEW QUORUM AND SO THE IDEA WAS GOING TO BE DIG A HOLE. AND BURY THE UNITS INTO THE HOLE WHAT OUT HOLE WAS AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND YARD HOLE IN ALL THE DEVELOPMENT WHO HAD BEEN DONE IN THE SURROUNDING AREA WHICH MEANT THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO EXPORT THAT DIRT DOWN ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES DOWN THE FREEWAY. AND IT WAS APPROXIMATE TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR YOU DO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND YARDS TIMES TWENTY DOLLARS THE ARE THAT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS JUST ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THIS PROJECT NOT WORK. ALONG WITH THAT WE HAD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IT THIS WAS BE ENTITLED DURING THE DOWNTURN HAD IT OF THE PMR REQUIREMENT A 15% WAS MEANT. SEVEN LITTLE OVER SEVENTY UNITS WERE NOT TO BE SOLD AT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND AS YOU CAN SEE WERE SOLELY SO THAT EIGHT ARE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO TAKE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR SUBSIDY TIMES OVER SEVENTY UNITS. YOU CAN SEE THAT'S ANOTHER THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PAINFUL -- ISSUE FOR THE PROJECT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WORK WITH THE CITY AND I FEED OUT WHICH MEAN I PAID THEM A NICE BIG. VERY LARGE CHECK WOULD NOT THIRTY FIVE MILLION OR TO FEE OUT OF THE PROJECT COULD MOVE FORWARD. AS WERE ABOUT TO START THE PROJECT IN IF I GO BACK TO TIME WHEN WE WERE READY TO BREAK CONSTRUCTION. CALIFORNIA FISH WILDLIFE CAME ALONG AND TOLD ME THAT THIS. PROPERTY WAS POTENTIAL HAVE A DOUBT FOR THE RED LEGGED FROG. MAKES GIVEN THE TIGER SALAMANDER. DECEMBER SPECIES -- THE TIGER SALAMANDER EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN COUPLE MILES AWAY WOULD BE THE ONLY SIDE WE SEEN ATTIRE SALAMANDER BUT IT HAD HAVE ATTACK CHARACTERISTICS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY. BE HABITAT FOR THE TIGER SALAMANDER. A YEAR AND A HALF LATER -- WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA FISH WILDLIFE AS I WENT TO A PROPERTY OWNER ABOUT A MILE HALF AWAY HE TRULY HAD. TRUE CHARACTERISTICS. FOR A TIGER SALAMANDER AND PUTTING DOWN MEN'S AND USE THAT PROPERTY FOR MITIGATION WHICH WAS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE ENDOWMENTS AND AND SECURING THE PROPERTY. SO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA COSTS IN A DELAY OF THE YEAR AND A HALF I THINKING TO MARKET. IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT DELAY. THE HOMES WERE VALUED AT THE TIME PRIOR TO THAT CHALLENGE AT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND A UNIT. SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU LOOKING GO WILL YOU DO YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE DOING OKAY AND WE ARE. WE'RE DOING OKAY BECAUSE PRICES WENT UP BY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS DURING THE DELAYS THAT I HAD. WHICH ABSORB THE EXTRA FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST BUT WHO LOSES IN THAT EXAMPLE THE CONSUMER. IT OF THIS IS IT THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE TRI VALLEY CURRENTLY FOR NEW HOMES THIS IS MOST AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE CITIES OF PLEASANTON LIVERMORE DUBLIN AND SAN RAMON IS THE MOST AFFORDABLE PROJECT I'M AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THESE. ARE ATTACHED PRODUCTS. YES DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOWNTURN. THAT HOUSE PRICES WERE ALREADY ON THE THREE AND A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE SAME UNIT. AND SO THIS IS KIND OF THE VERY ABILITY YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKETPLACE. AND AND WHEN YOU CONSTRAINTS SUPPLY AND YOU HAVE THE JOB GROWTH THAT WE HAVE SO WE ALL WANT TO CELEBRATE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS GREAT ECONOMY IN THE BAY AREA. BUT YOU'VE GOT A BALANCE A SUPPLY OF HOUSING WITH THE DEMAND. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE BECAUSE OF I GET A HAIR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TOWN HOME -- IN THAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE. SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IT SUCCESSFUL FOR OUR COMPANY. BUT IT I DON'T LOOK IT IS BEING SUCCESSFUL FOR THE COMMUNITY JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT UNFORTUNATELY. YOUNG PEOPLE MOST OF MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BUYING. IN THIS DEVELOPMENT ARE OUNG JUST NEWLY STARTING OUT FAMILIES THE NUMBER OF YOUNG KIDS. USING THAT REC CENTER I MEAN IT'S IT'S WONDERFUL BUT IT IS I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL STRETCHING THEMSELVES TO LIMIT BILL FOR THIS HOUSE. THEY WITHOUT OPEN TO QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS ON THIS PROCESSION DOCTOR WITH. JUST A QUICK QUESTION YOU MENTIONED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A COMPONENT. HOME WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE OUT IT WAS AT THE TIME IS TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT. AND NOW IT'S AT 15% IN THE CITY THEY'VE CHANGED IT AND MAYBE INCREASED. SO DID YOU GET. I'VE BEEN ASKED A QUESTION A PRIDE OF THE ANSWER. TO AND YOU GET ANY BREAK ON THE PERMIT FEES ANYTHING RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE THE AFFORDABLE UNITS YOU GET NO BREAK WHEN YOU BUILD AFFORDABLE UNITS. IN FACT. YOU IF YOU TRIED IT DOWNS BACK AT ALL THOSE UNITS YOU CANNOT DO THAT EITHER. DON'T TRY TO COME IN AND HAVE A DIFFERENT [inaudible] HOME. IN FACT THEY WANT TO HAVE OF DISBURSED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY IF I TRY TO TAKE HIM INTO A AN ISOLATED AREA. NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT IN THE OTHER MAKE SURE THAT THE SUSPECT OUT HOME IN FACT BEDROOM COUNT THERE'S A PRESCRIPTION TO HOW MANY THREE BEDROOM SEMI TWO BEDROOMS. YOU NEED TO HAVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND GET NO BREAK SO YOU LOSE ON EACH ONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW THAT TIME YOU LOSE BIG TIME. MEANS THAT I ALSO THOUGHT BROUGHT OUT HERE I GIVE MY EXAMPLE. THOSE EIGHTY OF THOSE DAMN TO GO TO SAFEWAY SAFEWAY SENSES FOOD STAMPS. BACKED THE GOVERNMENT AND THEY GET REIMBURSED. WE DON'T GET A STAMP TO SEND ANYBODY TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PER HOME SUBSIDY THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. SOMEHOW OUR PROJECT IS SUPPOSED ABSORBED THAT COSTS WILL WHO'S REALLY ABSORB THE COST. IT'S GOING TO BE THE OTHERS THAT ARE BUYING THE OTHER. EIGHTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF HOMES RIGHT. WHEN HE SAID THAT THE THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCLUSIONARY QUITE WAS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION YOU FEED OUT WHAT WAS THE FEE OUT PAYMENT? WELL I FEED OUT. I MADE THE AGREEMENT WHEN I FEED OUT IN 200-092-00010 WHEN THEY WERE STARTING TO REALLY WANT THIS PROJECT ANTI FEET OUT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THERE WAS A REALLY GOOD NEGOTIATION DOES ASSEMBLY DOES. I COULD GET THE IDEAL TODAY. AND IT JUST IN BECAUSE OF OUR NEW ALSO I'M SORRY ALSO BECAUSE WHEN I DID THAT THE PRICING WAS AT LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AT THAT TIME. AND SO THE THIS SUBSIDY WAS CLOSER TO THREE I THOUSAND HOMES A FIVE ONE THOUSAND OR HOME SO WASN'T THIRTY FIVE MILLION WOULD. BUY MILLION TODAY GIVE MORE PRICES ARE GONE. THE TIME IT WOULD THE TIME IT WAS CLOSER TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TWENTY ARE NOT GO STILL GOT STOLEN -- OKAY THAT'S THE SWINGING VARIATION IN THE WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE RECESSION AND TO WHAT IT. IS NOW AND WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THE FEDERAL DELAY NOT HAPPEN RIGHT. SO THAT THE STATE DELAY WAS THE SITE. YEAH SORRY LEFT [inaudible] AND THEN. IT. IT WAS IT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM YEAH -- BUT A ITS BITS SPEAKS THE THE EXTREME VOLATILITY MEG AGAIN AGAINST MY CONSTITUENT PROSPECTIVELY PEOPLE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THE VARIATION CAN BE. THAT WIDE IT FEELS ANECDOTAL BUT IT'S HELPFUL TO SEE IT ON A PAGE TO KIND OF PAPER PICTURE WILL SALUTE YOU'RE DEALING WITH -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGE RIGHT AND HOW WE CAN ALL WORK CLEVERLY TO MAKE IT SO. HOME OTHERWISE WANT ONE POINT ON THAT IS REAL QUICK IS I THINK PART. HOW WE LOOK AT OUR BUSINESS AND THE RETURNS THAT WE EXPECT LIKE ANY INVESTMENT? THE MORE RISK WITHIN. THE HIGHER RETURNS ARE LOOKING FOR AND GIVEN THAT IT'S SO UNPREDICTABLE OUR BUSINESS. THAT I THINK THAT WE WE HAD THIS PERCEPTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HIGH RETURNS IT'S BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF TIMES WE LOSE. WHEN YOU HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WITH THIS ONE WAS YOU HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE UP FOR ALL THE PROJECTS THAT YOU NEVER GOT DONE YEAH? AND IN THAT JUST BECOMES BECAUSE IT'S A RISK REWARD A SITUATION. I SOME MEMBER FRIEDMAN. JUST SO I'M CLEAR THE THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PER UNIT PERMIT FEE HAS SETTING INCLUDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOT. SO WHY ACTUALLY NOW TODAY IT'S A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND IN THE REMARK WHY IS THIS THE USER THOSE ARE HIGH AREN'T THEY ON YOUR EXTREMELY HIGH. WIRE THEY SO HIGH FOR THIS PROJECT COMPARED TO OTHERS AT A LOCAL KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE IN THE CITY A LITTLE MORE CREDIT SOME SAY IT'S A LOCAL. CODES ARE YEAH FEES THAT WE PAY OUR PERMIT FEES THAT WE'RE PAIN ARE. OURS. EACH CITY HAS A DIFFERENT FEELING STRUCTURE AND SO MANY IN THIS CASE INCLUDED A THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ART. AN ART FEE NOW IN THAT SITUATION WHAT I DID IS I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE ARE TO THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE I ALSO HAD TO CONNECT TO THE THE PUBLIC TRAIL SYSTEM AND SO I WENT OUT COMMISSION VARIOUS ARTISTS AND PUT PUBLIC ART HONOR TRAIL SYSTEMS BECAME VALUABLE FOR THE COMMUNITIES. I WAS OKAY WITH THAT BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FEE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PERMIT FEE BUT BE ARTSY SCHOOL FEES WATER IN GET ON THE LIST OF ALL THE FEES THAT ARE IN AND THEN. SCHOOL FEES AND YEAH THAT'S WHAT IT'S KIND OF WHATEVER COUNCIL WANTS APPROVED HIS THEIR FEE STRUCTURE THAT THEY CAN. JUSTIFY NO THERE'S A NEXUS STUDY FOR HOW YOU GO ABOUT DETERMINING FEES. BUT IT'S HARD FOR US TO CHALLENGE THOSE -- THOSE STUDIES CLEAR FOR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE UNITS THIS OUT OF CURIOSITY YOU HAVE NO COMMERCIAL THIS DEVELOPMENT NOT IN THIS DEVELOPMENT AND HOW FAR THESE FOLKS FROM A GROCERY STORE -- WE HELPED BUILD THE INTERCHANGE ISABEL INTERCHANGE HELP GET THE FUNDING FOR THAT. OR TEN YEARS AGO AND IT'S A MYLAN HALF. BECAUSE GOES ACTUALLY. THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE DOWN THE STREET. OKAY THANK THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BFORE WE GO TO OUR LAST -- PANEL. THEN THAT'S WHEN YOU THANKS MISTER CHAIRMAN ALL KIDS IS QUICK AND TO THE POINT AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM BUILDERS WHO SUCCESSFULLY BUILT IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE. AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE THE STATE DOES PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THIS OBVIOUSLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TURN THE FEES AS PLAIN JUST OUTLINED FOR YOU. ON EACH OF THOSE DECISIONS ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN IMPACT THE COST. BUT THE STATE DOES PLAY A ROLE IN THIS AND SO COUPLE THINGS WE JUST WANNA BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AND I KNOW WHERE AT THE END OF BOTH HIS HEARING AND ALSO THE END OF THIS SESSION. BUT AS YOU PLANNED FOR NEXT YEAR -- BOTH GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES OF EXPRESSES OUR TO BUILD AS MUCH AS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA PER YEAR. LAST YEAR WE PULLED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PER THE LEGEND WAS OFFICE IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT OF CPO SAID INDEPENDENT OF US. THAT THE CURRENT NEED OF HOUSING IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS A YEAR JUST TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH. IT'S WERE BUILDING BUT HUNDRED TEND UNDER FIFTEEN THOUSAND SO EACH YEAR THE SUPPLIES DIMINISHING THE DEMAND IS INCREASING AS YOU SEE THE COST IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. SO PART OF THIS IS ADDING SUPPLY. AND WHERE THE STATE CAN HELP IN THAT A COUPLE THINGS SEEK WAS A HOLY GRAIL FOR ENVIRONMENTS WE RESPECT THAT BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO EXPEDITE. THE SUPER PROCESS WE USE IT FOR LARGE STADIUMS AND OTHER MAJOR EVENTS MIGHT WE CONSIDER FOR HOUSING. STATE WATER BOARD THIS MANY TIMES WE HAVE TO GET WATER KNOW OUR WATER PROCESS SUPPOSED TO STATE LAW BUT THEIR WASTE YOU THAT MUCH MORE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AND MORE AFFORDABLY. WE TOUCHED ON DEVELOPER FEES THERE REALLY IS NO NEXUS -- BUT EVERY TIME A BUILDER SAYS I DON'T LIKE YOUR NEXUS AGO WILL GET BACK TO YOU. WILL GET BACK TO YOU AND TIME DELAY IS YOUR ENEMY IS A BUILDER SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS TO FOR SOMEONE TO BRING CLARITY TO THAT. IT'S JUST ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. MITIGATION OFFSETS JOHN TOUCHED ON THIS -- OBIT BUT IF YOU HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED ACRE PARCEL AND YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH SIX HUNDRED ACRES SOMEWHERE ELSE TO OFFSET THE MITIGATION. THAT JUST ADDS CRIMES SO OF THEIR WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT WE CAN STILL BILL BEAUTIFUL PARKS. BUT WE NEED YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED ACRES OF OFFSETS. CODE MANDATES WHETHER IT'S SOLAR WHETHER IT SEISMIC AND WE DO HAVE THE MOST. ENERGY EFFICIENT SEISMICALLY SAFE HOMES ALREADY IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA SO THIS FACTOR THAT IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE POLICY DECISIONS THEY DO IMPACT THE BOTTOM LINE -- AND ALSO JUST DUMB THINGS WITHIN A ARE BE IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THESE ARE THINGS THAT COST -- IN THE LAST SCENE WE TOUCHED ON WAS SCHOOLS SO THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS APPROVED NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS WITH ONLY ALLOCATED SIX HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. SO THE MORE YOU ALLOCATE SCHOOL MONIES THE LESS IT COSTS FOR DEVELOPER FEES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE MORE OUR SCHOOLS ARE BUILT REFURBISHED. SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ARE HERE WE JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO US ON THIS. AS MENTIONED BEFORE THIS IS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WORDS THIS ISN'T ONE AND DONE WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE. AND WE'RE JUST PART OF IT THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER COMMUNITY THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING. BUT AS THE HOME BUILDERS NOW WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT WE CAN BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION WHEN TO DO THAT GOING FORWARD SO MISTER CHAIRMAN. CAN THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION TO YOU WE DO AGAIN JUST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING US THE TIME TO SHARE INSIGHTS AND KNOWLEDGE REGARDING HOMEBUILDING. THANK YOU DAN UP I WANT TO GIVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASKING QUESTIONS BEFORE WE WRAP UP -- OR MAKING IT A COMMENTS AS WELL -- IF THEY'RE NOT HOW DISSIMILAR THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO SHOWED UP TODAY MISTER SANTIAGO AND HIS FRIEDMAN MISTER BERMAN IS MISTER WOULD I MISS OUT YOU ARE CURRY -- I THINK IT SHOWS -- THAT THERE IS A HUGE APPETITE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TACKLE ISSUES OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY PARTICULARLY FOR THIS THIS METAL -- THAT I THINK IS OF A CONCERN I'M SURE ALL OF US SITUATES WHETHER IT'S A NOR CAL SO COW -- SO COASTAL OR INLAND ALL OF US ARE DOING WITH IT RIGHT. ON I THINK TODAY'S PRE CONVERSATION HELPS TO DEMYSTIFY I'M SOME OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH TO GET PRODUCT A TO THE TABLE ON HOW. YOU CAN START OUT WITH SOMETHING THAT'S INTENDED TO BE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS BUT THROUGH A VARIETY OF OF LENGTHY. EXPERIENCE AS YOU MADE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE I'M I THINK IN MY TIME IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY LEARNED THAT CERTAINTY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS AND WATCHING THE VARIABILITY OF THE PRESENTATION. OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TO ENOUGH EIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND RIGHT -- YOU GET A SENSE OF JUST EXACTLY WHAT UNCERTAINTY CAN DO IN TERMS OF TIMING A PROLONGED PROCESS AND ADDING TO OVERALL COSTS -- MORE SAFER -- I WANNA THINK THE CBI OF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE TO DEVELOP SOME THE SNYDERS DEFINE DEVELOPERS WHO HAD LIVED EXPERIENCE THAT ARE WILLING TO SHARE -- TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AGAINST OR DEMYSTIFYING THE PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN THAT THE BRICKS STICKS COSTS ONE THING BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER STUFF THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF I'VE. FLIRTED WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING TO INCLUDE -- IN BILLS NOT JUST A FISCAL IMPACT WHICH WE ALWAYS SEE BUT A HOUSING IMPACT BUT WHAT COULD THIS DO IN TERMS OF INCREASING OR REDUCING THE AMOUNT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AS WE LOOK AT SOME LEGISLATION THAT WE ADVANCE. A HERE OR MAYBE ASKING LOCALS TO DO THAT SINCE WE KNOW THAT THEIR KEY PARTNERS IN THIS -- I WANT TO SAY THAT THE DISH SO FOR FUTURE HEARINGS WE WANT TO HAVE A DIALOGUE -- WITH -- THE WORKERS WHO DO THESE PROJECTS -- WITH THE TRADES TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON IT WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS SIMULTANEOUSLY THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT WAGES AND AND AND SOME CERTAINTY PROCESS ON THEIR END AND HOW THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE HELPFUL IN THIS I THINK WE HAVE A SHARED -- INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT HOUSING GETS BILL BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THOSE WORKERS AND THE TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BUILD IT RIGHT -- IN SO THIS IS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE MIGHT GO HOPE FOR OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE IS ALWAYS TO TAKE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE HERE INTERDICTED LEGISLATION. THAT EACH MEMBER WHO'S HERE HAS DONE IMPORTANT BUILDING IN THE SHORT TIME THAT MS FREEMAN I'VE BEEN HERE -- WE HAVE WORKED ON HOUSING ISSUES ARE THIS IS NOT THE LAST OF THIS FOR US -- AND AGAIN APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME EFFORT ATTENTION ON GIVING US SOMETHING TO TO NOT JUST TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT TO PUT OUT TO THE UNIVERSE FOR THE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH THIS ON ON PUBLIC ACCESS -- TO HOPEFULLY AGAIN GET A SENSE OF WHAT CAN WE DO I JUST CLOSED WITH A STAT THAT MY CITY RECENTLY PUT OUT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. THE BILL IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OVER TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS FOR FOLKS -- AND ABOVE A MODERATE INCOME IN THAT SAME SEVEN YEARS ABOUT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS WERE BUILT FOR VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME SAN DIEGANS. USUALLY THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT OF FORMERLY DOLLAR PROJECTS TAX CREDITS ETCETERA. FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR THOSE SEVEN YEARS FOR PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE THIRTY THREE UNITS IN THE ENTIRE CITY BUILT OVER THE SEVEN YEARS. OF ITS HOUSING IS A LADDER THERE ARE NO ROUNDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LATTER AND THEREFORE THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE. AND WHAT MY CONSTITUENCY IN TERMS OF A OF A GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS -- IS A FUNCTION OF THIS INABILITY TO CREATE THE KINDS OF HOUSING THAT YOU I THINK WANT TO BASED ON THE TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. ON BUT CHRIS WE CAN'T -- SO MY DOOR REMAINS OPEN AND I APPRECIATE I KNOW THAT YOU ALL WILL BE IN TOUCH AS WELL BUT LET'S CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN BUILD SOME LACKS THE SKILL IN THE LATTER. THAT ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT THAT A PARTY SAY THE COUNTRY DOES MORE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS AND JUST BUILD THIRTY THREE HOMES -- LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THE RENTS DOWNLOAD BUTTON PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY FROM OWNERSHIP FROM ALL CALIFORNIANS.
