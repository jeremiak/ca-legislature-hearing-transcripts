MAJOR FISCAL FACTS OF THE

COSTS PRIMARILY IN THREE WAYS.

00:18:31.543 --> 00:18:33.412
FIRST IT WOULD INCREASE THE

SUPERVISION FOR CERTAIN

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:40.853
OFFENDERS. SECOND WOULD LIKELY-

00:18:40.919 --> 00:18:42.287
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES

POPULATIONS. AND THEN WE KNOW

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:57.402
THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.804

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.018
WORKLOAD. WE ALSO KNOW THE

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:13.986
MEASURE COULD INCREASE STATE

AND LOCAL COURT RELATED COSTS

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:18.590

NUMBER OF FELONIES REDUCING THE

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.727
NUMBER OF MISDEMEANORS. AND

INCREASE COURT PROCEEDINGS BY

TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD

BE SIGNIFICANT DO YOU HAVE ANY

LOCAL CORRECTIONS COSTS. COULD

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.089
THERE COULD BE A NET INCREASE

OF THE MEASURE- AND THEN WE

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.100
ESTIMATED THAT THE INCREASE IN

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.635
COURT RELATED COSTS COULD BE

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:44.536

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:49.040
DEEPER DIVE IN SOME OF THE

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:49.641
STATISTICS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:53.011
CRIMES. I AM AWARE OF A STUDY

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.846
AT BEING A UC IRVINE ON

00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:56.781
PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN DAYS

00:26:56.848 --> 00:27:00.385
THEY FOUND- VERY SIMILAR.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.454
RESULTS TWO PP I SEE. I'M NOT

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.823
AWARE OF OTHER STUDIES THANK

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:05.457
YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:09.427
CHAIRMAN SISTER. AS CHAIR.

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.262
SENATOR JACKSON GO AHEAD VERY

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:14.499
BRIEFLY I THINK WHAT IS REALLY

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:16.167
IMPORTANT HERE IS TO FIND OUT

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:18.336
WHAT THE TRENDS ARE. ARE WE

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:20.205
SEEING REDUCTION IN CRIME.

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:22.540
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:24.409
OR THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.077
EXPRESSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.979
THE CRIMES GOING RAMP AND SO

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:29.447
FORTH BUT THE DATA SEEMS TO

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.449
SHOW TO THE CONTRARY AND I

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:34.019
THINK. PART OF THE MOTIVATION

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:36.421
FOR THIS INITIATIVE IS THE

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:39.557
BELIEF THAT CRIME IS GOING UP

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.593
AND SO I THINK WHAT REALLY IS

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:43.194
IMPORTANT IN TRYING TO

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:45.397
DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OR THE

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:47.298
ACCURACY OF REASON THE

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:50.001
MOTIVATION FOR THIS. IS WHETHER

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.469
OR NOT WE ARE SEEING CRIME

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:52.871
GOING UP OR CRIME IS GOING

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:55.707
DOWN. AND I THINK THAT IS SORT

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:59.778
OF THE SINGULAR ISSUE HERE ARE

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:02.180
AT IS AGAIN OR THE INITIATIVE

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.748
SO WE PASSED TO REFORM THE

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:05.016
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.952
THEY WORKING OR NOT. AND IT'S

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.822
MY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET A AN

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:14.225
HONEST STRAIGHTFORWARD. IN FACT

00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:16.728
BASED DETERMINATION OF THAT IS

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.496
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:20.098
BEEN WORKING ON OR COULD YOU

00:28:20.165 --> 00:28:21.900
CITE US WHAT STUDIES YOU'VE

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:22.967
LOOKED AT THAT WAS MENTIONED

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:26.037
THE PP I SEE- AND THE SECOND

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:27.572
ONE THAT JUSTICE INVADED ME.

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:30.041
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:32.377
FIND OUT JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:33.978
IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:34.979
TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT AN

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.282
INITIATIVE LIKE THIS IS HELPFUL

00:28:37.348 --> 00:28:41.352
OR HARMFUL. HAVE THIS THE

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:46.291
SECOND CITY WAS UC IRVINE. AND

00:28:46.357 --> 00:28:50.028
AT. CRIME IS AT A HISTORICAL

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:54.632
LOW OVERALL- WE HAVE SEENIN

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.067
RECENT YEARS SORT OF A SMALL IT

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:57.335
TAKES ARE DOWN TAKES IN

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:58.336
DIFFERENT WHETHER TALKING

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.305
ABOUT- PROPERTY CRIME A VIOLENT

00:29:00.371 --> 00:29:01.539
CRIME THE ANSWER CAN BE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:04.109
DIFFERENT- IT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:29:04.175 --> 00:29:06.678
THAT WE'VE DONE TO DO IT AS IN

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:08.580
DEPTH STATISTICAL CAUSAL

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:10.548
ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.084
THESE INITIATIVES ON CRIME

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:15.587
RATES. YOU SEE HAS BEEN PLAYING

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:20.892
THAT ROLE- THING. I ACTUALLY

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:21.893
HAVE THE PP I SEE REPORT BEFORE

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.430
ME- IN YOU MAY CONTINUE MR

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:27.999
SERVER BUT JUST TO CLARIFY I'M

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.834
LOOKING AT THE REPORT GOT THE

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.270
GRAPH RIGHT HERE. BOTH PROPERTY

00:29:32.337 --> 00:29:34.105
CRIME RATES AND VIOLENT CRIME

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.307
RATES ARE LOWER THEY'RE NOT

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:39.310
HIGHER AND IN FACT THE PRICE

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:42.814
THEY ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS IN

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:45.150
THIS IS RIGHT IN THE PP I SEIZE

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:49.187
REPORT. YEAH WELL NOT ACCORDING

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.955
TO THIS REPORT BUT THE MAYBE

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.624
THERE'S NEW DATA BUT WE'VE NOT

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.325
SEEN IT AND NEITHER REALLY- NOR

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:57.028
PP I SEE IS PRESENTED IT. BUT I

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:57.829
WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINISH AND

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.831
THEN I'LL GO TO. MY QUESTIONS

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:02.967
GO AHEAD. YEAH THE ONLY THING I

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:04.669
WAS GOING TO- PROVIDE SOME

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:07.238
CLARIFICATION AND IS THE P. P.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.607
I. C. STUDIES THAT DID FIND.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.676
SOME POTENTIAL INCREASE IN

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.878
PROPERTY CRIMES ESSENTIALLY THE

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.914
METHODOLOGY THIS STUDY WAS. TO

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.782
TRY TO CREATE A SYNTHETIC

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.884
CONTROL GROUP SO WHAT THEY DID

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:21.553
IS THEY LOOKED AT CRIME RATES

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:23.788
IN OTHER STATES AND SORT OF.

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:27.926
TURN THEM INTO A- A PACKAGE.

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:30.061
THAT HAD FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA

00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:32.564
CRIME RATES CONSISTENTLY- IN

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.400
PAST YEARS. AND BY TAKING THIS

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:38.269
APPROACH THEY WERE ABLE TO-

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.804
MAKE A STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT

00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.006
OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.875
TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA HAD.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.610
PROP FORTY SEVEN AND

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:46.377
REALIGNMENT NOT BEEN

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:48.046
IMPLEMENTED. AND WHAT THEY

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:50.448
FOUND IS THAT- IN THE CASE OF

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.183
BOTH PROP FORTY SEVEN AND

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.285
REALIGNMENT- IT DOESN'T APPEAR

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.520
THAT THEY REALLY CONTRIBUTED

00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:58.489
SIGNIFICANTLY TO- MAJOR

00:30:58.556 --> 00:31:00.959
INCREASES IN CRIME AT ALL- THAT

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:01.993
MOST CRIME RATES WERE

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.661
UNAFFECTED BY THE MEASURES

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:04.596
HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF PROP

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.564
FORTY SEVEN. THEY DID THINK

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:07.298
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.033
CONTRIBUTED TO SOMEWHAT OF AN

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.635
INCREASE AND LARCENY THEFT

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.570
CRIMES AND IN THE CASE OF AB

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.072
ONE OH NINE. THEY THOUGHT IT

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.907
POSSIBLY INCREASED I COULD HAVE

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:17.275
CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.410
AUTO WITH US. OVERALL THEY

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:20.912
DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICAN IMPACTS

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:25.717
ON ON THE RATE OF CRIME. THANK

00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:28.119
YOU. FOR YES IT INDEED. IN THE

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.622
REPORT THAT THE- PROP FORTY

00:31:30.688 --> 00:31:32.523
SEVEN. MAY HAVE AFFECTED THOSE

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:38.663
STEPS THAT YOU ROOF WE REFER.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.899
TO IT DOES NOT SHOW BUT IT DOES

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:44.002
NOT SHOW THAT INCREASE IN TERMS

00:31:44.068 --> 00:31:46.671
OF THE YEAR TO YEAR SO CLEARLY

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.172
WE'RE STILL GONNA NEED DATA

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.674
WE'RE GONNA NEED DATA FOR

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:52.877
NINETEEN- AND I THINK IT WOULD

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:54.312
BE VERY HELPFUL IMPORTANT TO

00:31:54.379 --> 00:31:56.748
GET THAT DATA BECAUSE-

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.750
INDEPENDENT OF THE INITIATIVE.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:01.719
WE HAVE THE LAW THAT- ASSEMBLY

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:04.222
MEMBER JONES SAWYER. AUTHORED

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:06.057
IN THAT IS IN EFFECT WHICH THE

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:07.392
LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:09.994
REGARDING THE- ORGANIZED RETAIL

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:12.430
THEFT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:13.598
I'D LIKE TO KNOW BUT I DON'T

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.333
THINK WE HAVE THE DATA YET IS

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.402
WHETHER THERE'S BEEN AN

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:19.637
INCREASE. IN WELL MAYBE NOT AN

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:20.705
INCREASE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.106
EXIST BUT WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:24.242
A REST THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:26.177
NOW THAT THAT LAWS IN EFFECT

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:26.711
WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:31.382
CONVICTIONS- IS. IT AGAIN WITH

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:33.451
SUCH DATA MIGHT INDICATE TO US

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:36.921
EITHER THAT- MINIS ARE TRICKY

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:41.125
BECAUSE- IS LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:41.693
UTILIZING THE TOOL THAT WAS

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:43.795
PROVIDED- HAS IT BEEN

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:45.830
EFFECTIVE- BECAUSE THE

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:48.666
LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:52.070
EXTEND IT IT HAS TO SUNSET IN

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:52.603
TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT- THE

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.373
LEGISLATURE. COULD IT CHOOSE

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.377
TO- EXTENDED- BUT IT'S ALSO AS

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:02.146
WAS REFERENCED BY OUR ILIO

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.981
ELEMENTS OF IT ARE BUILT INTO

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:08.052
THIS INITIATIVE. AND IF IT'S- I

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.287
MEAN PART OF WHAT WE'D WANT TO

00:33:09.354 --> 00:33:12.490
KNOW IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT-

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.891
LEGITIMATE TO CONTINUE IT OR

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:15.660
NOT BUT WE NEED THE DATA BEFORE

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:18.429
WE CAN. IN REALLY GET THAT

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:20.732
NIGHT OUT YOU HAVE IT. NO I

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:23.034
DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME BUT- WHEN

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:24.369
WE WORK ON OUR BALLOT MATERIALS

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.337
WE TYPICALLY DO REQUEST

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:27.972
ARRESTING CONVICTION DATA FROM

00:33:28.039 --> 00:33:29.273
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.776
THAT IS LIKELY A CRIME THAT WE

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.711
WILL REQUEST. A DATE ON TO

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.179
INFORM THE ANALYSIS THAT WE

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:37.115
PREPARE THIS SPRING GOOD I LOOK

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.517
FORWARD TO IT NOW YOU RAISED

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:43.254
THE POINT THAT. WHAT PROP FIFTY

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:45.390
SEVEN DOES AND THIS INITIATIVE

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.592
DOES ON DO A NUMBER OF. ASPECTS

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.527
OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE WHAT IT

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:55.133
DOES IS IT CHANGES SOME-

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:57.301
OFFENSES THAT WERE FELONIES TWO

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.203
MISDEMEANORS BUT IT PRIMARILY

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.807
IT GIVES- INCARCERATED PEOPLE

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.642
THE ABILITY TO GET CREDIT FOR

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.944
TIME SERVED. FOR CERTAIN

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:08.679
REHABILITATIVE BEHAVIORS BUT

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:09.814
WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR FIND YOU

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.315
STATED THIS BUT I WANTED TO RE

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.750
EMPHASIZE IT AND HAVE YOU

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:15.286
ADDRESS THIS IS THAT WHILE IT'S

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:16.421
CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED IT'S

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:18.623
REALLY JUST THE ABILITY TO GO

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:20.591
BEFORE THE PRO BOARD EARLIER.

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:22.460
IT DOES NOT MANDATE THE PAROLE

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.162
BOARD TO RELEASE SOMEONE SO

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.497
WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN AND I

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.665
JUST WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:28.065
THERE'S A LOT OF

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.567
MISUNDERSTANDING THAT SOMEHOW

00:34:29.634 --> 00:34:30.935
PROP FIFTY SEVEN GUARANTEES

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.904
PEOPLE'S RELEASED EARLIER NO IT

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.972
DOES NOT. IT PURELY ALLOWS YOU

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.040
TO GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:38.576
EARLIER IF YOU HAVE DONE THESE

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:40.411
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:43.281
PROPERLY- BUT SO WHAT I'M

00:34:43.347 --> 00:34:44.949
INTERESTED IN HAS THERE BEEN

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:47.919
ANY INCREASE IN DECISIONS BY

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:48.719
THE PAROLE BOARD REGARDING

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.788
RELEASE BECAUSE THE DATA I HAVE

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.057
SEEN IS THAT OVER THE YEARS

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.592
THERE'S BEEN NO DIFFERENCE.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:35:00.331
IT'S ABOUT 18% 1118% LIKELIHOOD

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:01.199
WHETHER PROP FIFTY SEVEN PROST

00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:05.436
PROFIT. SEVEN WE'RE GETTING.

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:06.070
WHEN YOU GO ABOVE THE PROBE OR

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:09.006
DO A DIFFERENT IN DATA. SOME OF

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:11.175
THE MEASURE- A CREATED A NEW

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:12.710
PEARL PROCESS FOR NONVIOLENT

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:15.346
OFFENDERS- THAT THE RELEASE

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.448
RATE IS AROUND THAT THE NUMBER

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:20.918
THAT YOU CITED. IT HAS CHANGED

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.553
MAYBE SLIGHTLY IN RECENT YEARS

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.655
BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:26.390
COULD GO AHEAD GOOD THE ONLY

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.826
THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT-

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.495
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.763
CONSIDERED FOR PAROLE NOW UNDER

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.932
PROPERTY SEVEN THAT ONE TO HAVE

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.701
BEEN CONSIDERED FOR PAROLE.

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.336
ABSENT THE MEASURE AND SO WELL

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.104
THOSE FOLKS ARE GETTING

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.005
RELEASED AT THE SORT OF

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.474
HISTORIC 18% RATE THOSE FOLKS

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:44.909
WANT OF BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.177
THE MEASURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:47.612
ABLE TO GO BEFORE CORRECT

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:48.746
CORRECT- BUT I THINK THE

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:52.116
IMPORTANT. POINT HERE IS. I

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:53.217
THINK WOULD BE WITH WORTH IT

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.852
AND USEFUL TO GET SOME MORE

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.589
DATA BECAUSE. PART OF THE

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:02.293
PURPOSE OF FIFTY SEVEN. WAS NOT

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.829
ONLY TO LOOK AT HOW WE SENSE

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:08.733
MORE RATIONALLY AND HOW WE- TO

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:09.534
REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.002
DOING THE REHABILITATIVE

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:14.405
PROGRAMMING THAT- WE INTEND NOW

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.940
THAT WE HAVE OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:18.676
CORRECTIONS. IS THE DEPARTMENT

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:19.076
OF CORRECTIONS AND

00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:22.380
REHABILITATION. BUT IN FACT MY

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:25.082
IN AND PART OF IT ALSO WAS TO

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:27.418
ASSIST US IN MEETING THE COURT

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.654
ORDERED GOAL FOR POPULATION

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.722
REDUCTION. WHAT WOULD BE

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.724
INTERESTING IS TO REALLY GET

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:35.092
NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH IT REALLY

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.827
HAS A CHEAP THAT SO IN OTHER

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:39.463
WORDS THERE I WOULD IMAGINE

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:40.698
THAT SOME OF THE INITIATIVE

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.500
PROPONENTS FEEL THAT THERE'S

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.102
BEEN SOME. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.338
A HUGE WHOLESALE INCREASE IN

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:48.606
PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.775
IMPRISONED BEING RELEASED AND I

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.877
REALLY DOUBT THAT'S THE CASE

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:55.279
BUT- IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:58.749
NOTE THAT. WE COULD FOLLOW UP

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:00.518
WITH THE YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:02.687
DECENT DATA. IF THAT BE HELPFUL

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:07.592
IN. THANK YOU- LET'S SEE ANY

00:37:07.658 --> 00:37:09.193
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:15.433
TO ALEJO. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:19.437
NOW MOVE TO. WHAT WE HOPED

00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:22.440
WOULD BE THE PROPONENTS OF THE-

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:25.142
INITIATIVE AND AS I MENTIONED-

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:27.378
NINA SALERNO FROM CRIME VICTIMS

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.580
UNITED WAS GOING TO PRESENT BUT

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.316
SHE CALLED US LATE YESTERDAY

00:37:32.383 --> 00:37:33.684
AND INDICATED THAT SHE- HAD

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.786
WITH IS NOW ILL AND WOULD NOT

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.254
BE ABLE TO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.423
FROM CRIME VICTIMS UNITED. WHO

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:51.168
WOULD. LIKE TO ADDRESS S. I'M

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.270
ALL RIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:55.039
THE NEXT PART OF OUR AGENDA AND

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.641
IF A PROPONENT OF THE

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:58.676
INITIATIVE IS ABLE TO BE HERE

00:37:58.743 --> 00:38:00.511
BEFORE WE CONCLUDE WE WILL GIVE

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:05.383
THEM TIME ON THAT DíAS. SO

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:10.888

TODAY THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE IS

00:39:07.545 --> 00:39:09.580
UNNECESSARY IT TAKES A

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:11.382
CALIFORNIA'S JUSTICE SYSTEM IN

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.150
THE WRONG DIRECTION AND IT WILL

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:15.786
BE HARMFUL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:16.721
FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:18.923
COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE STATE

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:21.292
BUDGET. THE BACKERS OF THE

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.860
MEASURE WOULD LIKE VOTERS TO

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:25.896
FORGET ABOUT THE DECADE LONG

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:28.532
DECADES LONG FAILED EXPERIMENT

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.935
IN OVER INCARCERATION AND

00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:34.071
RETURN TO THE FAILED APPROACHES

00:39:34.138 --> 00:39:36.741
OF THE PAST WE ANTICIPATE THAT

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.008
CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE SMARTER

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:39.677
THAN THAT AND THE MEASURE WILL

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:41.746
BE REJECTED IN NOVEMBER FIRST

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.848
ALL DESCRIBE FOUR COMPONENTS OF

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:44.782
THE MEASURE THAT WE WANT TO

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:46.417
MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND AND

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:47.852
THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW IT IS

00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.653
UNNECESSARY TAKES US IN THE

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.088
WRONG DIRECTION AND WILL BE

00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:53.023
HARMFUL TO OUR STATE. THE

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.893
MEASURE REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.062
PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN THAT

00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.163
WAS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.031
CHANGED SIX LOW LEVEL CRIMES

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:02.833
FROM FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.502
AND ANNUALLY RE ALLOCATES

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:06.103
PRISON DOLLARS TO TREATMENT AND

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.506
VICTIM SERVICES SPECIFICALLY

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.508
THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES FELONY

00:40:10.574 --> 00:40:12.710
CONVICTIONS FOR LOW LEVEL THEFT

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.312
CRIMES BY REDUCING THE FELONY

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.081
THRESHOLD FROM NINE HUNDRED AND

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.649
FIFTY DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:19.717
AND FIFTY FOR SPECIFIED

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:22.219
OFFENSES CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.521
ONE OF THE LOWEST PHONY

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:26.457
THRESHOLDS FOR THEFT CRIMES IN

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.592
THE NATION FOR EXAMPLE IN TEXAS

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:31.095
THE PHONY THRESHOLD IS TWO

00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:31.929
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:33.264
THIS IS WAY OUT OF LINE WITH

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.666
WHAT VOTERS WANT SECOND IT

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.469
REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF PROP

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:39.069
FIFTY SEVEN THE BALLOT MEASURE

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.005
THAT REQUIRES REHABILITATION

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.039
FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:43.741
SPECIFICALLY IT DOUBLES THE

00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:45.609
NUMBER OF OFFENSES THAT ARE

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:48.045
EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:50.214
REHABILITATION CREDITS TOWARDS

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:52.016
RELEASE IT ALLEGES THAT IS

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.351
ENSURING THAT A BUNCH OF CRIMES

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:56.153
WILL THEN BE CONSIDERED VILE.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:56.687
IT'S BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.289
CHANGING THE SENTENCING OF ANY

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.124
OF THOSE CRIMES AT ALL INSTEAD

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.725
IT SIMPLY PREVENTING PEOPLE IN

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.027
PRISON FOR THERE'S CRIMES FROM

00:41:03.093 --> 00:41:04.995
BEING INCENTIVIZED TO COMPLETE

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:06.897
REHABILITATION AND PREPARE FOR

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.532
RELEASE. NEXT THE MEASURE

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:11.168
REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF PROPS OF

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.269
TWENTY ELEVENS PUBLIC SAFETY

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:14.205
REALIGNMENTS BY AUTHORIZING

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.340
PEOPLE- ON COMMUNITY

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:17.274
SUPERVISION WHO VIOLATE SOME

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.510
TERMS A RETURN TO PRISON

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.711
INSTEAD OF USING LOCAL

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.513
GRADUATED SANCTIONS THIS WILL

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.582
DRIVE THE PRISON POPULATION UP.

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:27.651
FOURTH AND REALLY IMPORTANTLY.

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.253
THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.754
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF STATE

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.590
MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR

00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:34.091
CRIME PREVENTION AND SMARTER

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.492
APPROACHES TO LOCAL PUBLIC

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.728
SAFETY. PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.997
HAS ALREADY SAVED AN ESTIMATED

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.932
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:43.601
MONEY FOR VICTIMS SERVICES

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:45.302
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.705
YOUTH PROGRAMS. THAT WILL

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:48.639
REDUCE IF THE POPULATION GOES

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:51.642
UP. BACKERS OF THIS MEASURE ARE

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.410
FOCUSED ON FEAR MONGERING TO

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:54.678
PAINT A GRIM PICTURE THAT

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.113
JUSTICE REFORM IS CONTRIBUTING

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.681
TO VIOLENT CRIME. THAT IS

00:41:57.748 --> 00:42:00.384
FALSE. CRIME CALIFORNIA REMAINS

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.519
AT HISTORIC LOWS SHIFTS IN

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:05.155
CRIME RATES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.324
IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:10.127
HOLD CONSISTENTLY STATEWIDE THE

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:12.096
VERY MARKEDLY FROM COUNTY TO

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.198
COUNTY. STATE POLICY IS NOT THE

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:15.933
PROBLEM THIS MEASURE IS

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.269
UNNECESSARY. IT'S UNNECESSARY

00:42:18.335 --> 00:42:20.104
TO IMPROVE RESPONSES TO LOW

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.773
LEVEL CRIMES BECAUSE FIRST THE

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.141
VAST MAJORITY OF LOW LEVEL

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:25.576
CRIMES ARE NOT REPORTED TO

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.344
POLICE THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.380
SINCE LONG BEFORE THE JUSTICE

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:31.382
REFORM ERA EMERGED. PROPERTY

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:32.349
CRIME CLEARANCE RATES ARE

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:36.220
TYPICALLY LESS THAN 20% SO A

00:42:36.287 --> 00:42:38.188
FOCUS ON SENTENCING PEOPLE

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.425
LIMITED IMPACT CRIME PREVENTION

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.861
HAS A MUCH BROADER REACH SECOND

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:45.629
IT'S UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:47.831
TOOLS ALREADY EXIST. TO HOLD

00:42:47.898 --> 00:42:49.199
PEOPLE UP COULD BE CONVICTED OF

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:50.901
LOW LEVEL CRIMES ACCOUNTABLE

00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:52.569
WHETHER THOSE TOOLS ARE USED

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.905
LOCALLY OR NOT UNDER CALIFORNIA

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:56.874
LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A- AND

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:58.175
DETAIN ME. AND COURTS CAN

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.077
ENGAGE IN A MIX OF SANCTIONS

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:01.612
INCLUDING TREATMENT COMMUNITY

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:06.350
INCENTIVES TO HOLD PEOPLE

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:09.386
ACCOUNTABLE. THIRD IN TWENTY

LEGISLATION ALSO STRENGTHENED

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:16.460
ORGANIZE RETAIL THEFT LAW TO

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:17.761
IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.263
AUTHORITY TO ARREST AND DETAIN

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.132
PEOPLE- IN GAUGING IN REPEAT

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:24.568
AFTER CRIMES. IT'S ALSO ON

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:27.171
NECESSARY TO IMPROVE RESPONSES

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:28.872
TO VIOLENT CRIME BECAUSE

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.107
SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIME STILL

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.176
KERRY LONG SENTENCES REGARDLESS

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:34.178
OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ALL

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.946
FELONIES BY DEFINITION ARE

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:37.047
EITHER SERIOUS OR VIOLENT

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.916
CRIMES AND CAN CARRY LENGTHY

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:40.718
PRISON TERMS. THE PROBLEM IS

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:42.586
NOT WHETHER OR NOT PROSECUTORS

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:45.356
AND COURTS CAN ARE.

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:46.623
SUFFICIENTLY LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.258
LONG PERIODS OF TIME MANY

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.461
THOUSANDS ARE INCARCERATED IN

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:51.729
THIS STATE EVERY YEAR THE

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.831
PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:55.799
PEOPLE ARE RELEASED AND THAT'S

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.267
THE PROBLEM THE PROPERTY SEVEN

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:58.936
SOUGHT TO RESOLVE THE VAST

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.270
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:02.272
CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. ARE

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.074
GETTING OUT THE QUESTION WE

00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:05.809
NEED TO ASK IS DO WE WANT

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:08.078
PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED PREPARED

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.447
FOR RE ENTRY OR NOT BY REDUCING

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:11.281
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:13.283
ELIGIBLE FOR REHABILITATION

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.619
CREDITS WERE ACTUALLY HARMING

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.588
PUBLIC SAFETY. NOT HELPING IT

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:19.523
THERE'S NO RESEARCH THAT STATES

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.091
THAT LONG SENTENCES AND

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:23.093
WAREHOUSE STYLE INCARCERATION

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.095
WORK IN FACT RESEARCH SAYS

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:26.196
SHORTER SENTENCES WITH MORE

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.766
INFORMATION. WITH MORE EMPHASIS

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.734
ON PREPARATION FOR RELEASE IS

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.237
IT WHAT REDUCES REPEAT

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.506
OFFENDING. WORSE THAN BEING ON.

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:36.774
THIS MEASURE IT WILL MOVE

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.042
CALIFORNIA IN THE WRONG

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.276
DIRECTION QUICKLY A COUPLE OF

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.511
THE KEY REASONS IT'LL MOVE THE

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.845
STATE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

00:44:41.912 --> 00:44:43.080
AND LEAD TO MORE INCARCERATION

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.681
IN MORE PRISON COSTS. ROUGH

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:46.483
ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS TEN

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:47.985
THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.520
INCARCERATED IN THE STATE

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.855
ANNUALLY SECOND IT WILL LEAD TO

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:53.924
MORE LITIGATION THIS STATE IS

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.459
NOW JUST COMING OUT OF UNDER

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:57.061
THE THUMB FROM FEDERAL LAWSUITS

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.662
AND RETURNING TO NON COMPLIANCE

00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:00.497
WOULD BE HARMFUL. THIRD IT'LL

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.699
LEAD TO FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.134
STABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:05.502
LIVING WITH PAST FELONY

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.404
CONVICTIONS FELONY CONVICTIONS

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.839
COME WITH A LIFETIME OF

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:10.741
CONSEQUENCES FROM PROHIBITIONS

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:12.409
TO EMPLOYMENT TO HOUSING AND

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.378
MORE. CREATING MORE FELONY

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.313
CONVICTIONS FOR LOW LEVEL CRIME

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.316
IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY AND WILL

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.818
DESTABILIZE COMMUNITIES FURTHER.

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:22.820
FOURTH THIS WILL ALSO LEAD TO

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:25.422
FEWER DOLLARS TO HELP VICTIMS

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:27.424
OF CRIME. IN JUST THE SHORT

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.226
TIME SINCE PROPOSITION FORTY

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:30.127
SEVEN PASSED CALIFORNIA HAS

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:32.096
GONE FROM HAVING ONLY ONE

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:33.697
TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER TO NOW

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.399
HAVING FOURTEEN TRAUMA RECOVERY

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.634
CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE. THESE

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:38.969
ARE MODEL PROGRAMS THE

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:41.572
SPECIFICALLY SIEGE SEARCH OUT

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:43.574
AND FIND. UNDERSERVED VICTIMS

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.742
OF CRIME VICTIMS OF CRIME OF

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.678
SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.847
OTHER CRIMES IN WHICH THE

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:50.447
TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:52.015
SYSTEM HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ITS

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:53.750
ABILITY TO HELP THESE VICTIMS.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.185
WE NEED MORE TRUMP RECOVERY

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:58.255
CENTERS NOT LESS. TO BE SURE WE

00:45:58.322 --> 00:46:01.258
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ENSURE

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:02.826
SAFETY AND DIGNITY FOR ALL

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:04.628
CALIFORNIANS AND TO GROW

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:06.130
JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WORKS

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.764
EFFECTIVELY FOR EVERYONE. TO

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.100
MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD WE

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.136
ABSOLUTELY MUST BUILD MENTAL

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.470
HEALTH TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.038
ENTERING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:17.441
SCALE UP CISIS RESPONSE BUILD

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:18.709
MORE TROUBLE FROM RECOVERY

00:46:18.775 --> 00:46:21.512
CENTERS AND MANY MORE REFORMS.

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:23.213
BUT GOING BACKWARDS IS A

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.816
DISASTROUS PROPOSAL OUR STATE

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.317
IS JUST NOW RECOVERING FROM

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:29.186
RACIALIZED FEAR MONGERING

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:31.388
APPROACHES TO PUBLIC POLICY.

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:32.923
OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE REAL

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.192
HELP NOT A FEAR MONGERING SCAM

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.593
THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.861
VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WE URGE

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:41.031
THAT THIS MEASURE BE REJECTED.

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:45.602
THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:46.103
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

MEMBERS. KAMLAGER DOVE IN

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:59.149
QUESTION MR LACKEY. I. THE

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:02.152
THING THE THANK YOU FOR THE

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:08.292
PRESENTATION- I WHAT WASN'T

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.927
TOUCHED ON AND I SHOULD VAST

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:14.965
ILIO ALSO BUT PART OF OUR- HI

00:47:15.032 --> 00:47:18.468
PRISON POPULATION IS WE STILL

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.804
HAVE HIGH RECIDIVISM RATES. AND

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:24.341
MEANING WE AND THERE'S LOTS ONE

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:28.612
COULD ARGUE. WELL IT IT'S GOOD

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.113
TO SEE DATA AROUND RECIDIVISM

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.217
BECAUSE SOME OF OUR RECIDIVISM

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:35.719
IS DUE TO ANOTHER CRIME THAT

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.888
WAS COMMITTED BUT SOME IS STILL

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:42.159
DUE TO VIOLATIONS AND NOT

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:45.362
NECESSARILY THAT IN OTHER CRIME

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:50.300
WAS COMMITTED. FIVE AND I THINK

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:52.469
YOU TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE OF IF

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:56.506
WE CREATE. A BROADER CATEGORY

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.541
OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GET

00:47:57.608 --> 00:48:00.444
FELONIES THAT WE THEN HAVE THE

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.413
CIRCUMSTANCE OF ONE ONE STATE

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.983
ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE ARRESTED

00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:06.617
AND CONVICTED AND SERVED TIME

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.318
FOR THEIR PHONY ONCE THEY

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:11.888
RETURN HOME THEY HAVE THIS VERY

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:14.891
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE IN FACT

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:16.493
FOR EVER. OF EITHER GETTING

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.263
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OR SECURING

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.864
HOUSING OR VARIETY OF THINGS TO

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:23.800
DO TO THAT FELONY CONVICTION SO

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.902
COULD YOU SPEAK TO FOR A MOMENT

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.204
AROUND THE CONNECTION TO

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.739
RECIDIVISM WHICH IS ALSO

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:31.441
OBVIOUSLY PART OF WHAT WE NEED

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.443
TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IF WE ARE

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.778
BOTH TRYING TO REDUCE THE

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:37.447
POPULATION IN OUR PRISONS AND

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:41.218
MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. THE

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:44.354
ABSOLUTELY IF SO WHAT

CALIFORNIA VOTERS- WANT MORE

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.692
THAN ANYTHING FROM THE JUSTICE

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.395
SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM THAT HOLD

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:54.698
PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE STOPS CYCLES

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.867
OF CRIME AND GIVES PEOPLE A

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.235
PATHWAY TO MEETING FOR

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.570
REHABILITATION AND WHEN WE TALK

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.372
ABOUT MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:05.042
WE TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.743
TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY POST

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.945
CONVICTION AFTER YOUR TIME IS

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.815
DONE WHAT WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.817
IT LIKE MANY STATES IS IT'S

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.719
NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BACK ON

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.788
YOUR FEET. EFFECTIVELY AND

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:19.222
QUICKLY WHEN YOU'RE LIVING WITH

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.124
A PAST FELONY CONVICTION IT

00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.359
WASN'T JUST THE INCARCERATION

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:23.994
RATES THAT SKYROCKETED IN THE

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:24.928
EIGHTIES AND NINETIES IT WAS

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:27.497
ALSO THE NUMBER OF FELONIES IN

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:28.732
THE PENAL CODES AND THE NUMBER

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.100
OF PEOPLE CONVICTED OF FELONY

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.768
OFFENSES ONE IN EIGHT

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:33.403
CALIFORNIANS HAS A FELONY

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:35.572
CONVICTION ON THEIR PAST RECORD

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:36.373
THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.542
OURSELVES IS WHAT DOES MEANING

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:40.010
FOR REHABILITATION REALLY MEAN

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.379
PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETED TERMS OF

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:43.680
THE SENTENCE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:46.083
SHOULD BE TO GET TO GAINFUL

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.985
EMPLOYMENT ACCESS TO A STABLE

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:51.822
HOUSING ACCESS TO JOBS THESE

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.989
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.891
MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WHEN WE

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.626
PREVENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.695
PEOPLE. ARE TO GAIN ACCESS TO

00:49:58.762 --> 00:49:59.863
MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION WORK

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.565
HARMING PUBLIC SAFETY AND

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.533
REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.435
THE PERSON CAN STAY OUT OF THE

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:10.907
CYCLE OF CRIME. MS COME A GOOD

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:16.079
OVEN IN A. THANK YOU I KNOW

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:18.382
THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THIS

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:20.851
INITIATIVE ARE NOT HERE- AND I

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.819
DO HAVE TO SAY THAT TIME I'M

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:24.054
SORRY FOR THAT BECAUSE WHEN

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.155
YOU'RE NOT HERE YOU CREATE A

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.757
VACUUM FOR ARGUING YOUR POINT

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:28.992
ALTHOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:31.828
THEY ARE NOT. AND I ALSO WANT

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:34.131
TO STATE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS-

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.465
ON THESE COMMITTEES IS

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.601
COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.436
IT'S FIGURING OUT HOW TO INSERT

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:43.607
EQUITY. AND JUSTICE- INTO THAT

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:45.542
I WOULD HOPING THAT YOU COULD

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.710

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.818
WHERE THIS INITIATIVE MACE FALL

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.587
SHORT- AND HAT'S NOT BEING

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:58.822
ADDRESSED THAT SHOULD BE

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.257
ADDRESSED BECAUSE AS I LOOK

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.558
THROUGH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:03.360
THIS IT APPEARS TO BE RATHER

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:06.496
DRACONIAN TO ME. BUT IT'S ALSO.

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.564
SORT OF LIKE HOW YOU WOULD

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:10.901
TREAT A DOG IN A SHELTER- AND

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:12.636
NOT REALLY ADDRESSING YOU KNOW

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.938
TRIGGERS- THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:17.240
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HOW LAW

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.776

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.497
AROUND RECIDIVISM RATE AND

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:41.798
LOWERING THOSE NUMBERS.

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:43.366

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:44.668
BEGIN TO INTERACT TO RE

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:46.102
INTERACT WITH FOLKS IN A WAY

LIVING WITH PAST CONVICTIONS TO

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.866
TRY TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF.

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.534
THE EXPERIENCE BOTH LIVING WITH

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.236
THE PAST CONVICTION BUT ALSO-

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:20.704
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.105
INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR IN CRIME

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:23.640

LEAD TO INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.820
RIGHT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:38.722
DRIVERS OF CRIME WHEN WE TALK

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.323
ABOUT MAKING COMMUNITY SAFER.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.192
THIS ISN'T IT'S NOT A MYSTERY

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.326
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE

00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:45.495
PATHWAY TOWARDS- INVOLVEMENT IN

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:47.664
CRIME. THE REAL MYSTERY IS WHY

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.099
ARE WE ADDRESSING THOSE DRIVERS

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.201
OF CRIME ON THE FRONT END- WHEN

00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:52.736
WE TALK ABOUT WHO'S IN

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:54.004
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THE VAST

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.805
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE

00:52:55.872 --> 00:52:57.374
EXPERIENCING STRUGGLES WITH

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.543
DRUG ABUSE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.411
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE

00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:03.647
NOT ABLE TO QUICKLY AND READILY

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:05.515
ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.917
OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT.

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.718
THAT SHOULD BE A PUBLIC SAFETY

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.554
PRIORITY THAT SHOULD BE WHEN

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.389
WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO IMPROVE

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.090
COMMUNITY SAFETY ONE WOULD

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.091
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE AT THE

00:53:15.158 --> 00:53:16.526
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. OF

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:18.261
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO HELP

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:20.263
COMMUNITIES AND HELP PEOPLE WHO

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:21.765
ARE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:24.234
OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:28.305
FAILURE TO DO SO. AP IS PART OF

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:31.841
WHAT IS SO. DISINGENUOUS ABOUT

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.476
BOTH THIS MEASURE AND THE AND

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:34.878
THE BROADER BOB MASS

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:35.979
INCARCERATION ERA THAT WE'RE

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.582
RECOVERING FROM. INSTEAD OF

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:40.517
ADDRESSING THE CYCLE OF CRIME

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:43.720
OR OBVIOUS STOPPING IT. IN MANY

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.622
WAYS THE EXPLOSION OF THE

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.791
PRISON SYSTEM AND THE TOUGH

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.125
PUNISHMENT APPROACH TO PUBLIC

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:51.294
SAFETY. IT REALLY ACTUALLY HAS

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:53.830
DONE MORE TO SUBSIDIZE. CYCLES

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:54.731
OF CRIME THAN IT HAS TO

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.865
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM OR STOP

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:59.169
THEM. WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE

00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:02.439
COMMUNITY SAFE WE'VE GOT. TO

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:03.039
TALK ABOUT TRAUMA AND TRAUMA

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:03.940
RECOVERY FOR CAN. WE'VE GOT TO

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:04.774
TALK ABOUT MENTAL TREATMENT SUB

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.276
ABUSE TREATMENT AND GIVING

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.712
PEOPLE REAL STABILITY DIGNITY

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:10.647
AND STABILITY AFTER THEIR TIME

00:54:10.714 --> 00:54:12.115
IS DONE THAT'S WHAT WOULD

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.683
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.317

TRY TO SPECULATE AS TO WHY NOT

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.819
BUT THIS IS THEIR INITIATIVE

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:25.221
AND- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:27.023
TO HEAR FROM THEM BUT- THAT

ARE KIND OF STUNNING- BUT- I'M

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.203
WONDERING. IF PART OF THIS

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.372
WHOLE ISSUE OF REHABILITATION

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:43.640
AND SO WE CAN REDUCE THE

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:45.842
RECIDIVISM RATE REALLY DEALS

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.911
WITH THE KIND OF PROGRAMS AND

00:55:47.977 --> 00:55:49.512
OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:51.715
WHILE INCARCERATED. AND IT'S

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.617
BEEN A FRUSTRATION TO ME- TO

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.986
FIND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.755
CORRECTIONS HAS A VIRTUALLY

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:04.394
OPAQUE- APPROACH TO- SHARING

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.796
WITH US AS LEGISLATORS- IS TO

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.298
SAY NOTHING OF THE PUBLIC JUST

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:10.200
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS

00:56:10.266 --> 00:56:11.868
AND OPPORTUNITIES EXIST IN

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:14.437
PRISON FOR PEOPLE- SO THAT THEY

00:56:14.504 --> 00:56:15.805
CAN LEARN A TRADE SO THEY CAN

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:16.639
DEAL WITH THEIR ANGER

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:18.508
MANAGEMENT OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:20.910
AND WHAT HAVE YOU- SUPPOSEDLY

00:56:20.977 --> 00:56:22.212
WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:24.013
THAT. BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.915
CAN COMMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:27.884
THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT SO THAT WE

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:30.687
CAN REALLY HOLD THIS DEPARTMENT

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:33.323
ACCOUNTABLE IT TAKES WHAT ABOUT

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:35.325
10212% OF OUR STATE. BUDGET

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:37.927
GOES TO CORRECTIONS AND IF

00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:39.229
WE'RE NOT SEEING A REAL

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:41.531
IMPROVEMENT IN A REDUCTION IN

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:42.632
OUR RECIDIVISM RATE WHEN WE

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:44.868
KNOW. WHAT SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.836
ARE THAT WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.239
I'M WONDERING IF MY

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.508
CHARACTERIZATION IS SEEN IN

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:55.945
YOUR OPINION- INACCURATE OR

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:56.813
WHAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND WE DO

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.114
TO TRY TO LIFT THE VEIL OF

00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:00.016
SECRECY THAT EXISTS IN HALF FOR

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:03.119
DECADES IN THIS AGENCY IN IN

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:06.756
THIS DEPARTMENT. WE SAW A

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:07.557
COUPLE COUPLE OF THOUGHTS

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:08.424
RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION THE

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:10.960
FIRST IS THAT WHAT IS

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:14.197
PROMISING. A ABOUT THE STATE OF

ISSUE YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA-

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:53.215
LEAPS AND BOUNDS BECAUSE THE

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.622
WHEN PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE

BOX BEEN THERE TO OFFER

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:10.699
SOLUTIONS AND THE SOLUTIONS OF

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:12.033
ALWAYS BEEN BASED AROUND

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.803
PREVENTING CRIME. NOT NOT-

01:21:14.869 --> 01:21:16.705
INTERCEDING INACTIVE CRIMES

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:18.607
THAT'S NOT OUR PRIMARY

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.041
RESPONSIBILITY BUT BUT

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:20.942
PREVENTING THEM FROM HAPPENING

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.844
IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S A LONG

01:21:22.911 --> 01:21:25.113
TERM PROCESS. IT REQUIRES A LOT

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:27.215
OF EFFORT A LOT OF ENERGY IT'S

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.416
NOT JUST FROM PROBATION

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:29.884
OFFICERS IT'S A LOT OF ENERGY

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:32.187
FROM ALL OF OUR PARTNERS- IN

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:33.622
THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE A LOT

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:37.726
OF SERVICES TO PEOPLE FOR. DRUG

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:38.293
TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.262
TREATMENT. I WOULD SAY THE ONE

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.263
OF THE FRESHER. THE I'D IS A

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.898
PROBATION CHIEF IS- ASKING MY

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.533
PROBATION OFFICERS TO ENSURE

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.468
THE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.203
RESOURCES THEY NEED ONLY TO

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:50.005
HAVE THEM COME BACK AND SAY

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:50.605
THOSE RESOURCES AREN'T IN OUR

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.741
COMMUNITY. A LOT OF SMALLER

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.476
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:55.677
HAVE THE TYPES OF COMMUNITY

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.045
BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.514
MIGHT SEE IN- SAN RANCISCO BAY

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.750
AREA LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:03.285
AND HAND AND OTHER LARGE

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:06.421
JURISDICTIONS- SACRAMENTO IS

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.356
DOING. GREAT WORK WITH LOTS OF

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.425
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS-

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:11.593
THE PROBATION CHIEF THERE AND I

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.428
ARE GOOD FRIENDS AND I AM

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:14.162
JEALOUS OF SOME OF THE THINGS

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.630
THAT HE HAS ACCESS TO. AND I'M

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.499
ONLY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:18.833
BUT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.669
SAME TYPES OF RESOURCES. SO

01:22:20.735 --> 01:22:21.670
I'LL TELL YOU THE ONE OF THE

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:23.171
THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:25.307
SEE MORE OF IT IS COMMITTED

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:29.344
RESOURCES TOWARDS. LEAN CITY IN

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:32.314
IN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THIS

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.582
MANTRA THAT- YOU CAN HAVE ALL

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.184
THE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE WORLD

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.218
BUT WITH NO RESOURCES YOU CAN'T

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.753
MAKE IT STICK AND YOU CAN HAVE

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.288
ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE WORLD

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:41.890
BUT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY YOU

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.792
CAN'T MAKE THEM GO AND THAT

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.260
THAT REALLY IS THE BASIS OF OUR

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:46.861
WORK AT THAT THAT BALANCE OF

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.997
ACCOUNTABILITY OF STRUCTURE FOR

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:50.532
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A LACK OF

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:51.433
STRUCTURE IN THEIR LIFE THAT

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:54.102
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO- AVAIL

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.203
THEMSELVES OF AVAILABLE

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.404
RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:57.706
KNOW HOW TO GET TO THEM. AND

01:22:57.772 --> 01:22:58.807
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO STAY

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.542
INTACT WITH THEM OR THEY LET

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:01.576
ALLOW THEIR ADDICTION TO

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:04.412
INTERFERE WITH THEM CONTINUING

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:04.979
THROUGH. ALL OF THOSE THINGS

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.482
ARE WHAT. MAKE THE WORK IN

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.818
PROBATION SO VALUABLE IS WE CAN

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:10.919
PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE WE CAN

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:11.986
PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WE CAN

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:14.289
PROVIDE THE STABILITY- UNTIL

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.157
PEOPLE DEVELOP THEIR OWN. FOUR

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.192
REDEVELOP THEIR OWN IN SOME

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:20.095
CASES. AND THAT MEANS YOU YOU

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.296
HAVE TO HAVE A WELL FUNDED

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:22.530
PROBATION DEPARTMENT THAT'S GOT

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:23.998
PLENTY PROBATION OFFICERS THAT

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.200
WERE NOT JUST PROCESSING

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.468
NUMBERS BECAUSE WE GET TOO MANY

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.536
CASES. BUT YOU ALSO NEED WELL

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:29.637
FUNDED COMMUNITY BASED

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:31.606
ORGANIZATIONS AND WELL FUNDED-

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.341
SUPPORTS IN DEPARTMENTS THAT

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:34.676
ARE THERE PROVIDING RESOURCES

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:36.344
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY COUNTY AND

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:37.512
I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING ON ABOUT

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.047
THIS BUT MY COUNTY. MY

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:40.749
PROBATION DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:43.985
LOT OF THOSE- INTERVENTIONS. BY

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.787
PROBATION STAFF I HAVE TO HIRE

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.655
THE PEOPLE TRAIN THEM AND

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:48.423
PROVIDE THE SERVICES EITHER A

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.892
CLINICALLY- OR NON CLINICALLY

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.060
THROUGH MORAL RECOGNITION

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:52.861
THERAPY IN THOSE TYPES OF

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:54.329
THINGS WERE WE TRAIN PROBATION

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.597
OFFICERS TO ENGAGE WITH OUR

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:57.232
CLIENTS. AS COUNSELORS

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.667
ESSENTIALLY. AND A AND THAT'S

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:00.402
BEEN OUR SOLUTION BECAUSE WE

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.237
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CEOS IN OUR

01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.305
JURISDICTION THE CAN DO IT SO-

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:05.673
SO THAT'S WHAT I. WOULD SAY.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.410
AND HAVE YOU KEPT- OR DOES YOUR

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:11.579
COUNTY KEEP STATISTICS ON CRIME

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:14.215
RATES SINCE. HERE IS TO HAVE A

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.617
LITTLE MORE OF A ROBUST.

01:24:15.683 --> 01:24:17.585
REHABILITATION PROBATION.

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:19.554
OPERATION HAVE YOU KEPT

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.222
STATISTICS ON YOUR CRIME RATES

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.792
IN HOW IT'S BEEN IMPACTED YEAH

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.227
ABSOLUTELY SO- I MEAN EVERY

01:24:26.294 --> 01:24:27.162
COMMUNITY KEEPS THEIR

01:24:27.228 --> 01:24:28.430
STATISTICS ON CRIME RATES

01:24:28.496 --> 01:24:29.864
BECAUSE THE REPORTER TO THE

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:32.467
STATE AND FEDERAL DOJ- AND I'VE

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.903
I'VE ACTUALLY. JUST LAST YEAR I

01:24:34.969 --> 01:24:36.638
DID A FAIRLY IN DEPTHANALYSIS

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:37.605
BECAUSE I WAS HEARING SOME OF

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.007
THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF OTHER

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:40.208
PEOPLE WERE HERE IN THE CRIME

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:40.775
WAS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.610
SPECIFICALLY PROPERTY CRIME AND

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:43.178
I WANTED TO KNOW IF THAT WAS

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:46.181
TRUE MY COMMUNITY SO I PULLED

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:47.549
WERE REPORTED BY ALL THE LAW

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:48.383
ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES IN MY

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:51.085
JURISDICTION- AND WHAT I FOUND

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:53.888
WAS. SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE WHAT I

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:56.124
FOUND WAS WAS TWO FOLD- THE

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:58.026
FIRST WAS- THAT PROPERTY

01:24:58.092 --> 01:25:00.929
CRIMES- AT THERE ARE ALSO A

01:25:00.995 --> 01:25:02.931
WHOLE LOT OF PROPERTY CRIMES

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.399
AND IF YOU POINT TO ONE

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:05.333
PROPERTY CRIME IT'S UP IN

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.434
ANOTHER PROPERTY CRIME IT'S

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.736
DOWN THE OVER ALL HIGH IMPACT

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.805
IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE QUOTE WHEN

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.240
THEY LOOK AT PROPERTY CRIME.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.808
SOME PROPERTYCRIME WAS UP AUTO

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.543
THEFT FOR EXAMPLE AN AUTO

01:25:15.610 --> 01:25:17.745
BURGLARIES UP SIGNIFICANTLY IN

01:25:17.812 --> 01:25:20.348
MY COMMUNITY HOWEVER MOST OTHER

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.317
PROPERTY CRIMES WERE DOWN WHICH

01:25:22.383 --> 01:25:22.884
LED TO AN OVERALL TREND OF

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.319
REDUCED PROPERTY CRIMES IN MY

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:26.621
COUNTY- SINCE FRANKLY

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.723
REALIGNMENT AND PROP FORTY

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:29.591
SEVEN THEY'RE JUST THERE

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.025
WEREN'T SIGNIFICAN INCREASED BY

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:33.094
PRIME ALL DOWN. NOW THE OTHER

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.596
THING THAT I WOULD NOTE IS WE

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.397
NEED TO LOOK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:37.131
AT THE STATISTICS WE NEED TO

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:38.900
LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF WE'RE

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.869
LOOKING AT HISTORICALLY LOW

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:44.472
CRIME RATES BY LOWER THAN SINCE

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:49.944
THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND. I

01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:50.645
WHEN YOU SEE A INCREASE IN

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:52.113
PROPERTY. TALKING IT NEED TO

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.314
LOOK AT. A FORTY YEAR TO. YOU

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:53.915
CAN'T JUST LOOK AT YEAR OVER

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.483
YEAR SAY WHAT THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.084
WAS HIGHER THAN TWO THOUSAND

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:58.753
FIFTEEN. WELL YEAH IT WAS THE

01:25:58.820 --> 01:25:59.387
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS AS LOW

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.089
AS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. SO

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.590
LET'S PUT IT INTO THE CONTEXT

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.691
OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.660
THE LAST. WELL GENERATION.

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:07.128
REALLY AND WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:08.329
HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:09.964
AND I LOVE TO KEEP IN THERE. SB

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:13.034
FANTASTIC- THE REALITY IS WE'RE

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:14.536
GOINGTO SEE BLIPS IN CRIME

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:20.108
RATES. IT'S A CONTINUAL

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:22.210
DOWNWARD TREND OR STABILIZATION

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:22.977
OF CRIME RATES WERE WHERE

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:25.313
THEY'RE AT- BECAUSE THEY ARE AT

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:26.381
HISTORIC LOWS ROLES CAN HAVE

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:29.150
CRIME- BY I SUSPECT I WILL

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:33.955
ALWAYS BE EMPLOYED- HI. BUT

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.157
KEEPING THEM AT THE MODEST

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:36.991
RATES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.760
NOW IS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT'S

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.595
NOT TO SAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:41.629
CONSTITUENTS OF SENATOR

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:43.331
MORLOCKS REFERRING TO. ARE

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:45.667
HAVING ISSUES IN THEIR- POCKET

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:48.570
OF INTEREST. THOSE ISSUES ARE

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.138
REAL- AND WE THINK THERE ARE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:52.540
WAYS TO ADDRESS THEM- FOR

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:53.775
EXAMPLE WHEN A REFERENCE TO MY

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:55.543
COMMENTS ABOUT HIGH RISK MISTER

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:56.945
MINUTES. THEY ARE REPEAT

01:26:57.011 --> 01:26:58.580
OFFENDERS OR ARE HIGH RISK FOR

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.315
RECIDIVISM. AGAIN THEY DON'T

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:01.916
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AVAILING

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:02.650
THEMSELVES OF PROBATION

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.119
SERVICES OF THAT STRUCTURE AND

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.121
THE SUPPORT AND ACCESS TO-

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:08.823
CLINICALLY BASED SERVICES.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:10.858
WORTH PROVISIONS THE PATHWAY

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:11.993
FOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.561
JUSTICE TO GET TO THINGS LIKE

01:27:13.628 --> 01:27:15.330
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.532
DRUG TREATMENT AND MORE

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:20.034
RECOGNITION THERAPY IN THOSE

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:20.535
OTHER TYPES OF COGNITIVE

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:21.369
RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. WELL

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.271
WE'RE THE PATHWAY TO THAT FOR

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:24.606
IN A LOT OF INSTANCES AND MAYBE

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:26.774
UNFORTUNATELY- BUT THE REALITY

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:29.544
IS WE ARE. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.079
ACCESS TO A CERTAIN POPULATION

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:33.247
OF HIGH RISK OFFENDERS. BECAUSE

01:27:33.314 --> 01:27:34.816
THEY KEEP BEING HIGH RISK BUT

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:38.319
UNDER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS-

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:40.688
THAT THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM. AND

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.523
I JUST JUST AHEAD A QUICKLY

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.559
NOW. OF AND IT WAS A DISCUSSION

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:47.929
ON PRESENTED. YES HIGH RISK MR

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:50.865
MEANS YES AND WE- IN MY

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:53.234
COMMITTEE LOOKED AT. CERTAIN

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.737
CRIMES THAT WE POSSIBLY SHOULD

01:27:55.803 --> 01:27:57.639
LOOK AT GETTING THEIR DNA SO WE

01:27:57.705 --> 01:28:00.041
COULD TRACK THEM. WHEN LOT BUT

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.476
WE DIDN'T JUST IGNORE IT

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:03.144
BECAUSE MAYBE ONE THOSE THINGS

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:04.812
THAT HAD SLIPPED THROUGH PROP

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:07.048
FIFTY SEVEN AND FORTY SEVEN.

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:07.682
THAT SOUNDS LIKE PROBABLY COULD

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.851
HELP YOU. LAW ENFORCEMENT DO

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.285
YOUR JOB BETTER- BUT

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:14.455
UNFORTUNATELY- IT DIDN'T. TO

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.759
DATE. THE TO SAY THEY GOT THE

01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.060
AUTOMATION CHANGES SAID

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.529
ULTIMATELY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:23.798
FOR TO A SIXTY- BUT THAT'S

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:25.400
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:27.135
LEGISLATURE. WORKING WITH LAW

01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:29.270
ENFORCEMENT- POSSIBLY COULD

01:28:29.337 --> 01:28:31.139
HELP ON YOU WITH YOUR JOB DOING

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.674
IT BETTER IN A WAY THAT'S

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.008
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE VOTERS

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.309
WANT AND WHAT THIS DOES

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:39.180
COMMITTEE WANT. TO THANK YOU

01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:42.917
FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ANY OTHER A

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:45.753
YES SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.855
MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN-

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:50.258
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:52.293
HERE EARLIER IN THE HEARING-

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.862
AND THANK YOU FOR SOME OF YOUR-

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.230
FINAL COMMENTS I THINK THAT

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:59.967
SOMETIMES WE- FIVE THERE ARE

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:03.104
CERTAIN. CHARACTERS AND

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.572
PERCEPTIONS OF TAKE ON A LIFE

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:05.440
OF THEIR OWN THAT AREN'T

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.508
NECESSARILY ACCURATE I KNOW

01:29:07.575 --> 01:29:08.376
THAT EARLIER IN THE HEARING

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:09.944
THERE WAS A I THINK AROUND SOME

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.713
EXPLICIT REFERENCE MADE TO MY

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.848
OWN CITY OF. SAN FRANCISCO AND

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.116
THE AUTO BREAKING CHALLENGES

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.984
THAT WE HAVE AND I I'M I'M

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.786
ASSUMING THIS CAME UP BUT IT

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:21.589
DIDN'T. PROP 47-57 HAD NOTHING

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.058
TO DO- WITH AUTO BREAK INS IT

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.427
DIDN'T CHANGE- THE AUTO BREAK

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.229
AND STATUTES THERE WERE NOT

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:29.931
AUTO BREAK IN BALLOT MEASURES

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.699
AND SO I THINK SOME OF THIS

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.601
SORT OF GESTALT WELL THERE'S

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.303
WATER BREAKING PROBLEMS IN SAN

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:36.404
FRANCISCO NOW IN OTHER CITIES

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:37.472
AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S BECAUSE A

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:41.342
PROP 47-57 THAT IS. NOT

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.710
ACCURATE- WE HAVE AN ORDER

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:46.347
BREAKING PROBLEMS WERE ARE A

01:29:46.414 --> 01:29:48.249
SOME PROGRESS AND STARTING TO.

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:50.685
STOP THE INCREASE AND EVEN

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:52.487
SLIGHTLY START TO BRING IT DOWN

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:53.955
TO REAL CHALLENGE AS REAL

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:55.923
IMPACTS IN MY CITY- BUT IT'S

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:57.792
NOT BECAUSE THE PROPERTY SEVEN

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.694
PROP FIFTY SEVEN- AND IN SAN

01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:01.095
FRANCISCO PROPERTY CRIME HAS

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:02.096
BEEN GOING UP FOR ABOUT A

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:05.533
DECADE- IT STARTED BEFORE PROP

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.235
FORTY SEVEN AND BEFORE. PROP

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.370
FIFTY SEVEN- AND SO THERE ARE

01:30:09.437 --> 01:30:11.973
OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY AND SO WE

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:14.342
CANCERS TIED- THE TWO TOGETHER

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:18.112
AND THEN I ALSO- AND AGAIN I

01:30:18.179 --> 01:30:19.080
ASSUME THIS CAME UP EARLIER BUT

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.449
I. AM VERY FRUSTRATING THE MAN

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:22.183
THIS IS TRUE WHEN I WAS ON THE

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.085
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:24.652
ATTENDING A LOT OF COMMUNITY

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:26.287
MEETINGS ABOUT WITH THE POLICE

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:28.256
AND NOW YOU'RE UP HERE. THIS

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:29.991
NOTION THAT BECAUSE A FELONY IS

01:30:30.057 --> 01:30:31.259
NOW A MISDEMEANOR THIS IS

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:33.060
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND

01:30:33.127 --> 01:30:34.328
THE POLICE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:35.563
AND WE HEAR THAT SOMETIMES A

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:37.198
COMMUNITY MEETINGS. BECAUSE A

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.333
PROPERTY SEVEN WE CAN ARREST

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.168
PEOPLE ANYMORE BECAUSE

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:42.370
SHOPLIFTING WAS LESS THAN NINE

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:43.538
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WE

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.106
CAN'T ARREST ANYONE ANYMORE AND

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.240
THAT IS NOT ACCURATE YOU CAN

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.309
ARREST SOMEONE. FOR MISDEMEANOR

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:50.077
YOU CAN SPEND SIX MONTHS OR

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.846
TWELVE MONTHS IN COUNTY JAIL ON

01:30:51.913 --> 01:30:54.015
A MISDEMEANOR- I THINK WE AS A

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.750
STATE NEED TO DO BETTER AND

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:56.951
HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:30:57.018 --> 01:31:01.122
MISDEMEANORS. AND THAT IS

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:03.424
SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH BROUGHT

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:04.058
IN THE POLICE US TO DO WITH THE

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:04.992
COURT SYSTEM PEOPLE'S BE A CAL.

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:05.793
FOR THE BEHAVIOR EVE IF IT IS A

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.495
MISTER BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:10.097

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:12.600
MISDEMEANOR- IS JUST NOT- IS

01:31:12.667 --> 01:31:14.635
NOT ACCURATE SO I THINK WE

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:17.605
HAVE- THEY'RE- ALWAYS TO BETTER

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:18.439
AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:20.308
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AND

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:21.209
WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE WILLING TO

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:23.244
TAKE A FRESH LOOK. BUT THE IDEA

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.946
THAT- THESE BALLOT MEASURES

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:27.081
HAVE SOMEHOW IN CAPACITY TO LAW

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:29.884
