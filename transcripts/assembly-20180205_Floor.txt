JOHN WOULD DRAG HIMSELF OUT OF BED IN THE EARLY MORNING BUT ONLY HIS DAUGHTER INTO THE CAR AND LET HER SLEEP AS HE DROVE HOURS NORTH TO MAMMOTH LAKES. THERE'S IS THE STORY OF LOVE DEDICATION PERSEVERANCE AND I AM SURE THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE STORIES JUST LIKE THAT WITH OUR OLYMPIANS THAT WILL COMPETE STARTING THIS WEEKEND.

ASSEMBLY BILL FLORA THREE BY SOME THE MEMBER MELENDEZ AND OTHERS ACTUALLY INTO LEGISLATURE DECLARING THAT URGENCY THERE OUGHT TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. MEMBERS IF YOU'LL PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. WHAT THE CALIFORNIA WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT PROVIDES PROTECTION TO STATE EMPLOYEES IN THE EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OTHER ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR? TURNER SUCH PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN KEEPING THEIR JOB OR REPORTING ABUSE THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY WHICH YOU VOTED ON SEVERAL TIMES WILL GREAT WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF. BY PROHIBITING ANY LEGISLATOR WORD LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEE PER METALLIC FROM RETALIATING AGAINST ANY PERSON FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY ACTIVITY. AB FOR A THREE PROTECTS ALL STAFF FROM ACHIEVE IN THE OFFICE DOWN TO THE IN TURN AND AN URGENCY BECAUSE HAS BEEN ADDED SO THAT VICTIMS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS LONGER FOR THIS PROTECTION TO TAKE EFFECT. THEREFORE COLLEAGUES IT IS WITH URGENCY THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB FOR A THREE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I WILL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MENACE WEAKER. I'M A STRONG BELIEVER THE TRANSPARENCY IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT APPROACH. WE SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE OR BE AFRAID OF. TRUST ME I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES. ALLEGATIONS COULD MAKE GREAT HEADLINES. AND SOMETIMES EVEN MINOR MISUNDERSTANDINGS CAN CREATE GREAT TURMOIL. BUT WE SHOULDN'T LET THAT STOP US FROM ALWAYS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT. AND WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIANS ARE SMART BILL SEE PAST THE HEADLINES IN THE LONG RUN WILL ALWAYS GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT. THIS BILL PROTECTS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME OUT AND SPEAK AGAINST WRONGDOING. AND WE ALL NEED TO BE BRAVE AS WELL. IF YOU PASS THIS BILL AND WE SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE. PROTECTIONS THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I STAND AS A CO AUTHOR OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE IS BILL A. B.. FORA THREE. TO SAY THAT WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION IS HERE FOR LEGISLATIVE STAFF. NO ONE SHOULD BE INTIMIDATED OR THREATENED TO COME FORWARD IF A VICTIM. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ABUSE. AB BUT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH. TIME IS UP. TIME IS UP ON HARASSMENT INTIMIDATION AND RETALIATION. TIME IS UP AND NO LONGER WILL EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE AFRAID. TO COME FORWARD. TIME IS UP. ISN'T JUST THE HASH TAG. IT'S NOW A FACT. THINK YOU TO THE BRAVE AND THE COURAGEOUS WHO CAME FORWARD KNOWING THEY MIGHT NOT SEE JUSTICE BUT DID IT ANYWAY. AND THANK YOU TO MY ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE. FROM JUST NORTH OF MY DISTRICT LAKE ELSINORE. FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO AB FOR THREE THROUGH THESE YEARS. AND THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS. FOR AGREEING WITH ALL WOMEN WHO ARE HERE IN THE CHAMBERS WEARING BLACK THAT WE ARE DONE WITH HARASSMENT AND TRULY TIME. IS UP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOR A THREE. THIS MEASURE IS CRUCIAL IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP IN ENSURING OUR EMPLOYEES THE OTHER FELLOWS AIDS INTERNS OR OTHERWISE. FEEL SAFE WHEN DISCLOSING INSTANCES OF HARASSMENT I WANT TO COMMEND THE EFFORTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE IN NOT GIVING UP THE FIGHT IN THIS PROBLEM FOR FOUR YEARS. RECENT HISTORY HAS COIL CLEARLY SHOWN OF THE MEASURE. THAT THE MEASURE THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY OPERATED UNDER ARE NOT ENOUGH WE MUST REMAIN COMMITTED. TO LONG NEEDED INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IF WE ARE TO PROVE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE HOLD OURSELVES TO THE HIGH STANDARDS OUR POSITIONS CALL FOR. I RAN FOR THE SEAT TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE WHERE DECISIONS WERE BEING MADE. I WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE NOT ONLY FOR STAFFERS IN THE CAPITAL. BUT FOR JANITORS FARMWORKERS HOTEL WORKERS UNDOCUMENTED WOMEN. THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND ANYONE ELSE'S FELT VICTIMIZED AND UNHEARD. THIS TYPE OF HARASSMENT WILL NOT TURN EASILY. BUT IF WE COMMITF. STATE TO LONG TERM CULTURAL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE. THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO START THE PATH OF TRUE PROGRESS. I LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION. THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE IN CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. THANK YOU. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND AS I'VE SUPPORTED FOR MANY YEARS LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE ON THIS FLOOR I'M GLAD I HAD THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE HAS CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS CONTINUE IMPROVE THE BELL AND THAT WERE BEING ABLE TO. HAVE IT ENACTED HOPEFULLY SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT IT'S A FIRST STEP AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. BUT I DON'T WANT ANY OF OUR STAFF OR ANY OF US TO FEEL ASSURED THAT WE'VE COMPLETED THE PROCESS. THE TRUTH IS OUR STAFF IN THIS BUILDING ARE STILL AT WILL EMPLOYEES. AS SOMEBODY WHO CAME FROM ORGANIZED LABOR AND UNDERSTAND DEEPLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUT WELL EMPLOYEES AND THOSE THAT HAVE PROTECTIONS OF EITHER CIVIL SERVICE. AND OR MORE IMPORTANTLY A UNION CONTRACT IT STILL LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE. THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE TOUGH TO PUT IN BUT ONE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. AND THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PRESUMPTION SO WE HAVE CERTAIN LAWS WE PASS WHETHER IT'S PAID SICK DAYS WHETHER IT'S IMMIGRATION RELATED OFFENSES THAT SAYS THAT. AFTER A COMPLAINT IT IS IS. IS I WATCHED OR AFTER CITY HAS TAKEN THAT YOU HAVE A PRESUMPTION FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS THAT IF YOUR RETALIATED AGAINST THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. THE ONE TO PROVE THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S WHAT A PRESUMPTION IS A LOT AND ONE THAT WE NEED WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT NOT ONLY IN THIS BUILDING. BUTTON AND WORKFORCE AT LARGE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT FEATURE BECAUSE SOMEBODY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY YES I WAS LATE THIS WEEK. I AM BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT IT WAS LAST WEEK WHEN I LODGED A COMPLAINT. FOR Y. AMBIEN RETALIATED DANCE SO IT'S A IT'S A LEGAL CONCEPT IN ONE WHICH WE'VE IF YOU'RE TO BE FORTY ONE WHICH I WOULD. HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AS SOMETHING WE COULD PUT IN PLACE HERE. AND FINALLY I'D SAY THIS I'M GLAD WE'RE TAKING CARE OF SOME BUSINESS IN OUR HOUSE IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED DESPERATELY NEEDED BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST STATED. THAT THERE ARE WOMEN IN EVERY INDUSTRY WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS BASIC PROTECTION WHO HAVE BASICALLY NO PROTECTION AGAINST RETALIATION FOR CLAIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND I HOPE WE'LL SEE THE SAME BIPARTISAN SPIRIT THE SAME STRENGTH THE SAME INDIGNATION ABOUT THOSE WOMEN AS WERE SEEN ABOUT THE WOMEN HERE BECAUSE THEY ALL DESERVE IT OUR STAFF DESERVE MORE THAN THEY'RE GETTING TODAY IN THE WOMEN OUT THERE DESERVE. AS MUCH AS OUR STAFF GET AS WELL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL. THREE TIMES I BELIEVE SENATE OVER TO THE SENATE. AND NOW GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THIS LEGISLATURE RECENTLY AND SOME ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THIS ISSUE. REALLY NATIONWIDE. WE'RE NOW SEEING A LOT MORE ATTENTION PAID THAN HAD BEEN PAID IN THE PAST AND THIS BILL NOW IS SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED. AND I I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS IF YOU WOULD ON THIS BILL THE FLOOR NOW HOUSES BECAUSE IT POINTS OUT. SOME AREAS WHERE THIS BILL STILL COMES UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT. WE'VE TAKEN SOME STRIDES AND I'M GONNA ASK A MOBY EVERYONE WILL VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. BUT IT IS YET WORK. UNCOMPLETED IN THE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT SOME OF THOSE AREAS BETTER REALLY STILL BEFORE US TO TRY AND SOLVE. WE STILL HAVE TO MODERNIZE THE LEGISLATIVE OPEN RECORDS ACT STILL HAVE TO. CLOSE SOME OF THE GAPS THAT ARE BEFORE US IN THIS BILL AND IN OUR PROCESSES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. SO BEFORE WE THINK WE'VE DONE ALL WE NEED TO DO. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD COMPLETE THIS WORK OVER THE NEXT YEAR HOPEFULLY. IF NOT SOONER THAN THAT AND MAKE SURE. THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS A MODEL FOR HOW WE PROTECT OUR EMPLOYEES HOW WE PROTECT AGAINST RETALIATION THAT WE HAVE A VERY OPEN AND FAIR PROCESS THAT IS TRANSPARENT. AND IS IS ABSOLUTELY PROTECTIVE OF THE PEOPLE RE RELY ON ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IF WE CAN DO THIS AND THAT WE CAN WORK TO ENSURE. THAT EVERYONE ELSE ACROSS THE STATE IS AS PROTECTED AS WE. WE CAN MAKE OUR OWN EMPLOYEES THAT'S A STANDARD WE'RE WORKING TO SET HERE TODAY AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. PERSISTENCE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FROM LAKE ELSINORE YOU'VE GOT IT. NOR MAKE CHIU CHANGE IT DOES TAKE PERSISTENCE OVER TIME. I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE THE FIRST STEP. I AGREE THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE FINAL STEP. EVEN I. DISAGREE THAT. WE HE RETURNING IN THE STAFFERS INTO A DUES PAYERS FOR ORGANIZED LABOR THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING. BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FORMS NEEDED BY THINK THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE IRISH AND I'VE OF. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE MEMBER FROM LAKE ELSINORE FOR PERSISTING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SEEN THIS ISSUE LONG BEFORE IT WAS IN THE HEADLINES. AND IT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS AFFECTING STAFF ALL THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF WHO HAVE WORKED HARD EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS. I THINK THIS BODY ACTUALLY OWES THIS INSTITUTION IN THIS BODY PASSED THE BILL SEVERAL TIMES THAT WE WE OWE AN APOLOGY TO THE STAFF THEY HAVE LONG DESERVED THIS PROTECTION. AND THAT'S JUST A FACT. AND I THINK THE MEMBER ALSO FOR MAKING THIS A MEASURE THAT WAS NOT. A VEILED ATTEMPT TO PROTECT MEMBERS. OF REALLY TO GIVE THEM. THAT THE STAFF THE VERY RIGHTS THEY DO DESERVE. BECAUSE STAFF OR AS WE ALL KNOW THEY LOOKED OUT FOR US EVERY SINGLE DAY. THEY WORK VERY VERY HARD EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOK GOOD WE DO BETTER WE SUCCEED IN REPRESENTING OUR DISTRICTS. EVERYONE OF US SHOULD HAVE THEIR BACK THIS INSTITUTION SHOULD OF HAD THEIR BACK LONG AGO. AND THIS BILL IS A BIG STEP. IN GETTING THAT THAT WAY. AND THESE ARE STILL ON. ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE STILL STAFF THAT ARE GOING TED NOT HAVE YET AN INDEPENDENT. PRIVATE WAY WHICH THEY CAN RAISE A CONCERN WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY PROBLEM THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE AND GOING SOMEWHERE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE BEEN SEEN. TRYING TO LODGE A COMPLAINT THAT THEY HAVE WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO IN THAT AND HAVING AN INDEPENDENT PLACE FOR THEM TO GO. AND TO ANALYZE THEIR COMPLAINTS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING ACTION. BUT I THINK THIS IS A A GIGANTIC STEP REALLY I THINK THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD. ALSO ULTIMATELY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS REMEMBER THAT WE AS MEMBERS ARE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO SET AN EXAMPLE. ALL OF US ARE SUPPOSED TO SET AN EXAMPLE. AND MANY OF THE STAFF IN THIS BUILDING OUR YOUNG THIS IS THE FIRST JOB THEY HAVE WE ARE ALMOST IMPRINTING ON THEM WHAT IS APPROPRIATE OKAY BEHAVIOR. FOR THEM TO TAKE TO THEIR NEXT OFFICE. OR THEIR NEXT CAREER AND IT'S A DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF US TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. AND. NOT LEAVE THEM STANDING ALONE WHEN THEY'RE IN A PLACE WHERE THE GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE OR BASICALLY BAD BEHAVIOR WAITING FOR THEM TO BE THE ONES TO RAISE THE ISSUE. WAITING FOR THEM TO SAY GEE THIS IS REALLY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE GOING WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THEIR BACK. AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY IS YES WE'VE GIVEN WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS I HOPE THIS WILL GET SIGNED IMMEDIATELY. AND YES WE WILL KEEP WORKING ON THIS BUT WE'RE THE ONES WHO NEED TO STAND WITH THEM SO THERE ISN'T SOMETHING THEY NEED TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON. EVER AGAIN. AND DON'T LEAVE THEM TO BE THE ONES TO SAY SOMETHING FIRST. AND TO THOSE WHO DID THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE THANK YOU FOR COMING FOR WHEN YOU DIDN'T HAVE THESE PROTECTIONS WE WILL HAVE YOUR BACK. THANK YOU AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES ARE VERY PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THE. INSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT WILL OUTLIVE US. VITAL MARC WE NEED TO MAKE ON THIS TO CSUS MAKERS. A PLACE WHERE YOUNG BRIGHT PEOPLE. WELCOME TO SUPPORT THE MEMBERSHIP. AND THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE TO WORK ON THE FUTURE. THE. IN. VERY. DESPICABLE SORTS OF FACT PATTERNS WE'VE HEARD. ARE NOT JUST WRONG IN THEMSELVES BUT THEY CAST A PALL ON INSTITUTIONS SUCH THAT. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK TWICE ABOUT COMING TO WORK HERE. PEOPLE THAT MIGHT HELP US RESHAPE THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. SO. WE HAVE THE ONGOING WORK THERE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRED BY OUR PRESIDING OFFICER. COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE SENATOR MITCHELL OUR OWN HOUSE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY. MY COLLEAGUE. FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. TO BEGIN ADDRESSING. THIS BODY THE ENVIRONMENT WE OFFER PEOPLE THE ASSURANCE THAT THEY CAN COME HERE. BRING THEIR TALENTS TO BEAR ON THE FUTURE AND NOT BE DISTRACTED BY SECONDARY MATTERS. SO I JUST. IN ALL OF OUR WORK WE SET THE TONE OF THE INSTITUTION. PEOPLE LOOK AT US INDIVIDUALLY TO SET THE TONE INSTITUTION. BUT THIS PLACE IS IN LAW. RULES TO REINFORCE THAT. AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR OUR GAVE IT FOR THE FUTURE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. OF THAT THIS IS A VITAL BREAK THROUGH AND I DO HONOR YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE. I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER DALY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO. I THINK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM A LAKE ELSINORE FOR CHAMPION THIS ISSUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. SHE'S BEEN A GREAT CHAMPION FOR ALL THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AND THE ISSUE AND THE CAPITAL WILL BE A BETTER PLACE AND BETTER PLACE TO WORK BECAUSE OF YOU. THIS BILL HOLDS PERPETRATORS ACCOUNTABLE. CREATES MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY EMPOWERS VICTIMS TO COME. FORWARD WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF. MY CONSTITUENTS. AND MY STAFF. I AM PROUD TO BE A SUPPORTER OF AB FOR A THREE AYE URGENT STRONG AYE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. FIRST I LIKE TO THINK. THE AUTHOR. WHY VALUE AS A DEAR SISTER IN ARMS BOTH OF US BEING MILITARY AND FOR HER PERSISTENCE? ON THIS MATTER. SECOND. I LIKE TO THINK. ALL THE WOMEN. IN THIS HOUSE. THAT HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS. TO OUR STAFFS. YOU SHOULD OF NEVER. EVER. HAD TO GO ONE DAY OF WORK IN FEAR. FEAR OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. THERE ARE SEVERE INJUSTICES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. YOU. TO THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE THINGS THAT HAVE TRANSPIRED. IT IS MY HOPE MY PRAYER. THAT AB FOR A THREE. WILL HELP SETTLE SOME OF THAT. THAT OUR STAFF AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF MEMBERS IN ALL OF OUR OFFICES OF THIS INSTITUTION. CAN TAKE THAT STEP FORWARD. TO PROVIDE THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE SHOULD PROVIDE. THIS IS GONE ON FAR TOO LONG. THEY'RE MANY OF US THAT HAVE BEEN IN POLITICS. FEDERAL TO IT THERE ARE SOME LIKE MYSELF THAT ARE BRAND NEW TO IT. I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL MOVE FORWARD. WORKING TOGETHER. TREATING EACH OTHER AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. SHOOTING EACH OTHER WITHOUT RESPECT. THAT ALL EVERYONE IS TO. IRISH AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I MEMBERS AYE RICE AYE AS THE PRIOR COAUTHOR OF THIS BILL. ONE I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM US LAKE ELSINORE FOR WORKING ON THIS FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. ONE OF THE GóMEZ OF KNOWLEDGE OTHER WOMEN OR STAND IN THE GALLERY AS WELL. WEEK YOU'RE NOT STANDING ALONE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT THE MOMENT THAT IN TODAY IN TODAY'S HISTORIC AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT WERE PASSING. TO START TO GIVE SOME SUPPORT AND FROM FIFTY TO OUR STAFF BUT. I THINK WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS ABOUT SO MUCH POWER IN HARASSMENT IS ABOUT AN IMBALANCE OF POWER. ANYTHING ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO I HAD THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS. THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS OUT THERE AND I HOPE THAT WE COME AT IT WITH AN OPEN MIND AND OPEN HEART. AND A COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE WE ADD TO THIS PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PASSING TODAY WHETHER THAT ADDITIONAL. WORK TO THIS BILL WHISTLEBLOWER BILL WHETHER THAT'S WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF OUR STAFF BEING UNIONIZED. OUT WHETHER THAT'S OTHER LEGISLATION THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT NOT JUST ARE STATURE IN THE BUILDING BUT OUR STAFF. ARE WOMEN AND MEN ACROSS THE STATE. REALLY THERE'S AN IMBALANCE OF POWER ACROSS SOCIETY AND IF THIS IS HAPPENING IN OUR BILLION WHERE WE DO HAVE SOME POWER WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR WOMEN WHO ARE WORKING IN SPACES LIKE THE GARMENT INDUSTRY. I DO FEEL. WERE OUT THERE ARE HOTELS. WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THEIR JOB THAT JOB? IS THE PAYCHECK THAT KEEPS A ROOF OVER THEIR FAMILIES HOUSES AND FOR SO LONG HAVING HAD A VOICE. AND SO HOPE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE TODAY WE TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ALL THE VICTIMS HAVE HAD THE COURAGE. TO COME FORWARD TO HAVE FIELD THIS MOVEMENT. REALIZE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND WE COME WITH THAT THING OPEN HEART AN OPEN MIND WITH ALL OF THESE OTHER PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE COMING FOR US. IRAQ IS THERE ARE SOME GOOD IDEAS OUT THERE IN THIS BY ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS. BUT IT'S A BIG STEP BUT I DO WANT TO THINK AGAIN OUR COLLEAGUE UP FOR HAVING THE TENACITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS OUT THERE. LA AND I DO APPRECIATE THE MEMBERSHIPS WORK ON ON THIS AND I. FINALLY ONE I THINK THAT BY CAMEL COMMITTEE THAT'S OUT THERE. THEY ARE TASKED WITH WITH MAKING SURE WERE ENGAGED IN THAT CONVERSATION. ON AND THEY WERE NOT ENGAGED IN IT ALONE THAT WAY AND GET TO THE COMMUNITY THAT RAIN GAUGE AT THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THROUGH THIS BILL WILL FLEE OUR STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED WITH US SO WE CAN CREATE A BETTER SYSTEM THAT WE COULD ALL BE PART OF ACROSS THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SEE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OF ABATEMENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBER MELENDEZ WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. PLEASE IN GENTLEMEN IT HAS TAKEN US FOR YEARS TO GET TO THIS DAY. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISTER SPEAKER. FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS LEGISLATION YUNIOR STAFF HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL TO WORK WITH I DON'T I THINK THE BILL WOULD BE WHAT IT IS TODAY. ABOUT YOUR COLLABORATIONS I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT. I ALSO WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU FOR SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOUR YEARS IN A ROW. AND THIS HOUSE HIS STAND HAS STOOD UNITED ON THIS ISSUE AND TO ALL THE CO AUTHORS THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. MEN AND STANDING WITH US TO TO. SHIFT THE CULTURE IN THE CAPITAL. SO MONTHS AGO NEWS OF THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN SCANDAL A SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL BROKE AND WOMEN IN HOLLYWOOD TOOK A GIANT RISK. AND TOLD THEIR STORIES AND THEY SAID THEY'D HAD ENOUGH. AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE WE SAID ENOUGH CAMPAIGN WAS FORMED. OVER ONE HUNDRED FORTY WOMEN WHO WORK IN SACRAMENTO. TOOK A TREMENDOUS LEAP OF FAITH. THEY WROTE A LETTER TO TELL VARIOUS STORIES. BECAUSE THEY TOO HAD SAID WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH. IF THEY HADN'T DONE SO I M. CERTAIN WE WOULD NOT BE VOTING ON THIS BILL TODAY SO LADIES THANK YOU. CALIFORNIANS IN THE COUNTRY THEN LEARNED THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE SECRET SOCIETY OF VICTIMS RIGHT HERE IN THE CAPITAL THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY WHO HAVE BEEN TOO AFRAID TO SPEAK UP BECAUSE THE LAW OFFERED THEM LITTLE TOO NO PROTECTION. AND THERE IS A PRICE THAT IS PAID ONE VICTIMS ARE TOO AFRAID TO SPEAK UP. COST IS THE LOSS OF ONE'S DIGNITY. THE LOSS OF ONE'S SELF WORTH AND SELF CONFIDENCE. THE STRAIN ON ONE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES. THE DESIRE TO SPEAK UP BUT BEING TERRIFIED OF TELLING. THAT HE'S. AND THEN THERE'S THE ANGER THAT IS FELT. THAT THEY ARE IN A POSITION TO EVEN FEEL THIS WAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I PERSONALLY DO NOT KNOW A SINGLE WOMAN IN THE WORKFORCE WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT SOME POINT DURING HER CAREER I DON'T KNOW ONE. NOT SO LONG AGO THERE WAS THE WOMEN'S SEMINAR IT WAS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT IN WORKPLACE ISSUES THERE IS A CROWD OF TWO HUNDRED WOMEN. AND THE WOMEN WERE ASKED THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN THERE I'M ON THE RECEIVING END OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS. AND THE WOMEN LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM KIND OF CAUTIOUSLY.
