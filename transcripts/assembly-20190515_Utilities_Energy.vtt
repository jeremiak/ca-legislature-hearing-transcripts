00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:41.512
BEEN THE MOST COMMON QUESTION.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:42.980
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO LEAD A

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:46.884
BANKRUPT CONVICTED?

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.986
AND UNPOPULAR PJ.

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:50.354
WHEN I COULD HAVE EASILY RETIRED

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.756
I RETIRED TWICE ACTUALLY OF A

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:55.359
MEDICARE CARD IN MY WALLET --

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:56.561
COULD RETIRED IN COMFORT I DON'T

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.495
THINK I HAVE ANYTHING LEFT TO

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:58.663
PROVE THEM SORTED OUT HERE TO

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:01.466
BURNISH BY BUSINESS RESUME.

00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:05.102
SO WHY TAKE ON ALL THIS TROUBLE.

NEVER BEEN A BANKRUPTCY NEVER

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.538

WHY DO THIS THAT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:35:17.381 --> 00:35:19.317
QUESTION UP FOR A LOT ABOUT

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:19.617
[inaudible]

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:23.621
AND THE ANSWER THAT IN SEEK THIS

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:25.456

ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF THE

NATION.

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.839

THESE TERRIBLE EVENTS

[inaudible]

00:35:59.423 --> 00:36:00.625

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:14.305

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:15.907
I THINK GIVEN MY BACKGROUND MY

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.775
EXPERIENCE AND THE FACT THAT I

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.344

THINGS THAT I WANT TO HELP FIX.

00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:40.731
IT'S REALLY QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:41.832
IT MIGHT HELPFUL FOR SPOKE INTO

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:46.037
THE MIKE.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:48.205
SO AND APART FROM WHO I AM AND

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.640
ABOUT ME THE OTHER BIG QUESTION

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.242
IS.

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:53.945
WORRIED ABOUT WILD FIRE SAFETY.

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:54.912
I WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN TWO

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.280
PARTS FIRST WHAT P. GINNY IS

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:57.949
DOING AND THEN WHAT I'M DOING AS

00:36:58.015 --> 00:36:59.016

LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:10.595
OF STRUCTURES POLLS.

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.129
ALL KINDS OF EQUIPMENT.

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.631
BANNING LITERALLY TENS OF

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.466
THOUSANDS OF MILES.

00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:17.034
AND I'VE BEEN PROVIDING UPDATES

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:18.469
ON THIS TO THE CPU SAID OTHERS

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.838
WE'VE INTENSIFIED OUR VEGETATION

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.039
MANAGEMENT KNOWS AREAS.

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.641
INCREASING THE CLEARANCES AROUND

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.276
EQUIPMENT TARGETING PARTICULAR

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:27.411
TREE SPECIES ARE MOST

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.213
PROBLEMATIC AND FIRE SEASON.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.781
WE'VE EXPANDED PROCEDURES FOR

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.984
TURNING UP THE POWER FOR SAFETY

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.785
DURING WILDFIRE THREATS.

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:36.520
AND INCREASING OUR CUSTOMER

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.888
MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:39.423
EDUCATION ACTIVITIES SO THEY

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.625
WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:43.861
REMAIN SAFE IN THOSE INSTANCES.

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:44.795
HELLO TERRY THESE ARE ALL

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:45.896
IMPORTANT THINGS IS A VITALLY

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.832
IMPORTANT.

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:49.066
AND I BELIEVE SUBMIT SAYING IT'S

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.601
COMING MAYBE NEXT WEEK THE HEAD

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.403
OF OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.405
SAFETY PROGRAM WHO IS REALLY THE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.340
BRAINS BEHIND THIS OPERATION AND

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.376
HE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE DETAIL.

00:37:58.442 --> 00:37:59.977
SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT BUT I DO

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:03.047
KNOW THIS THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:05.282
TO ME OR I OR ANYBODY AT P.

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:07.418
GINNY CAN SAY THAT'S GONNA

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.420
MATTER ONE BIT.

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:10.821
ANOTHER WE CAN SAY THAT MATTERS

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:12.690
ONE BIT.

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:13.991
UNLESS WE LIVE UP TO OUR WORDS

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:17.261
AND OUR COMMITMENTS.

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.697
CANNOT RESTORE TRUST.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.365
WITHOUT RESULTS YOU CAN'T

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:22.933
RESTORE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.101
RHETORIC.

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:26.137
SO I DO KNOW THIS AFTER FORTY

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.705
YEARS OF DOING THIS.

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.106
WE CAN ONLY DO THAT WITH RESULTS

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.175
WITH OUR PERFORMANCE AND THOSE

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:33.044
RESULTS HAVE TO BE BASED ON

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.145
FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT THINGS AND

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.980
CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:37.148
RESULTS.

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.215
AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK I CAN

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.317
HELP OF MY TIME THE TVA WE WERE

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:41.752
CHIEF THE BEST SAFETY RECORD IN

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:44.055
THE ENTIRE EIGHTY FIVE YEAR

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:45.523
HISTORY OF THAT ENTITY.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.691
EVERY YEAR I WAS THERE WE WERE A

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.826
TOP DECILE PERFORMING INDUSTRY

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:49.860
AND SAFETY.

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:51.195
ON THE SAFETY FRONT WE WILL BE

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.963
BOLSTERED BY CHRIS HARD TO

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.166
FORMER NTSB CHAIRMAN WHO IS.

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:56.267
GOING TO BE A SPECIAL

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.402
INDEPENDENT SAFETY ADVISER

00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:00.037
REPORTING TO ME.

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.906
AND SO I WILL TELL YOU WE WILL

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:04.308
BE LASER FOCUSED ON SAFETY.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:04.875
BUT I WON'T EXPECT YOU TO

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.510
BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU SEE THE

00:39:06.577 --> 00:39:11.382
RESULTS.

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:11.949
YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME FOR THE

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.617
PEOPLE.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.553
THE CITIZENS THE CUSTOMERS HAVE

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:18.255
TO BE BETTER.

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:19.390
MISS PART OF THE REASON I HEAR

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.291
THAT WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF NOT

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.258
BEEN GOOD AND I THINK THE

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.494
OUTCOMES HAVE TO START BY

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.929
CHANGING THE FOCUS ON SAFETY.

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:26.297
AND NOT JUST FOR SAFETY SAKE

00:39:26.363 --> 00:39:27.331
WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT IF YOU

00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.766
LOOK AT ALMOST ANY INDUSTRY THE

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.701
SAFEST ENTITIES ARE ALSO THE

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.069
MOST SUCCESSFUL.

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:33.771
YOU CAN DRAW A DIRECT COMPARISON

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.673
TO SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES AND

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.641
THEIR SAFETY RECORDS.

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:38.442
AND SAFETY CULTURE.

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.010
SIMPLY CAN'T BE IMPOSED FROM THE

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.979
TOP DOWN I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE

00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.881
ANYTHING BY SAYING TOMORROW.

00:39:43.948 --> 00:39:45.783
OKAY WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE SAFE.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.418
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.719
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE SURE

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:51.555
EVERYBODY IS A LINE?

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:52.690
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT THE RIGHT

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:53.791
BEHAVIORS ARE RIGHT STANDARDS

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:55.126
AND FOLLOWING THAT SAFETY

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.294
CULTURES ABOUT ALIGNMENT AT THE

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:58.329
PERSONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL

00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:00.030
LEVEL. TO A SET OF BEHAVIORS AND

00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:01.699
BELIEFS AND THEN A COMMITMENT TO

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:05.202

THESE TRAITS.

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:14.145
AND THIS COMMITMENT.

00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:14.712
THERE'S A PROBLEM WE NEED TO

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:15.813

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.782
AND I'M.

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:19.550
PERSONALLY AWARE OF THE IMPACT

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.485
OF THESE THINGS IN MY SHORT TIME

OTHER THING WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON

SEVERAL LEVELS FROM YOU AND

ENERGY ACQUISITION WHICH RIGHT

NOW IS DE ACQUISITION -- BECAUSE

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:58.976
OF THE LOSS OF THE RETAIL.

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:01.245
I LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:03.547
AND THE PLIGHT OF THE RATE

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.416
PAYERS DUE TO FAILURE STATE

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.550
GOVERNMENT.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.485
HAD WE PREVENTED THE BANKRUPTCY

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.621
WE WOULD NO LONGER WE WOULD NOT

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:13.557
HAVE TO PAY YOU INTEREST RATES

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.793
FOR BONDS WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:18.228
PAY 11% FOR EQUITY.

00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:19.129
AROUND THE RATHER THE RIGHT

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.030
NUMBER.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.332
THAT'S WHAT P. JEANNIE AND IS

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.400
SUGGESTED ALL RIGHT NUMBERS NINE

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:26.303
OF TANNER TWELVE BUT I DO KNOW

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.707
WHY IT'S BECAUSE THE MARKET HAS

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:31.375
LOST FAITH.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.110
NOT ONLY IN P. JEANNIE BUT IN

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:34.078
THE STATE GOVERNMENT.

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:37.514
UP EITHER ABILITY OR WILLINGNESS

00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:39.249
TO PREVENT A BANKRUPTCY IS NOT

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:41.251
ONLY P. JEANNIE AT THIS POINT.

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.721
IT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:46.390
IT'S SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.258
WHICH EVERYONE AGREES HAS HAD

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.627
THE BEST -- FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:53.230
AND YET THESE TWO ARE BASICALLY

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:55.566
JUST ONE STEP ABOVE JUNK BOND

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:58.869
STATUS -- INTO WHY IT WENT INTO.

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:01.271
P. JEANNIE WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:03.407
NOT BECAUSE AT THE TIME AT LEAST

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:06.877
THEY HAD A HUGE AMOUNT TO PAY

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:07.911
THAT HADN'T BEEN DECIDED YET

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.246
WHAT AND IT STILL HASN'T BEEN

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.014
DECIDED.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.682
WHAT FIRES WERE CAUSED BY P.

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:14.985
JEANNIE BUT BECAUSE OF THE FEAR

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:17.054
THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND TO OF

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.522
BECAUSE THE FIRES?

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:22.626
AND THE FACT THAT THE STATE.

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:23.193
THROUGH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.428
COMMISSION WAS UNWILLING TO DO

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.229

BONDS OF AND FURTHER WE WOULDN'T

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.847

CALIFORNIA THAT TO HAVE BEEN

00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:11.742
IMPACTED BY.

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.844
SOME I THINK AND THE FAILINGS OF

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:15.779
THE COMPANY I THINK MR QUIRK

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:16.680
BRINGS UP THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.615
FAILINGS ELSEWHERE SO -- I

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.584
REPRESENT A BIG PART OF THE

00:45:20.651 --> 00:45:22.986
TERRITORY THAT PGD DELIVERS --

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.822
POWER TO MY CUSTOMERS ARE TO MY

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:27.024
CONSTITUENTS -- COUPLE THINGS

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:28.058
NUMBER ONE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:31.228
SHUTTING DOWN POWER WHEN WE HAVE.

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.230
EVENTS WORDS HIGH WIND AND MEN

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.965
WERE WE HAVE RISK.

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.767
AND SO A LOT OF WE NEED SOME

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.701
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THAT'S

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.603
GONNA WORK THERE'S A LOT OF

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:40.804
FOLKS OUT THERE THAT ARE ARE.

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:42.940
FEARFUL THAT IT DID NEED POWER

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:44.441
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MINIMIZE

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.609
OUR WRISTS BUT WHAT DOES THAT

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.277
LOOK LIKE I GUESS -- GOING INTO

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:50.214
THE FUTURE AS FAR AS OUT OF OUR

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.449
CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE MANY OF

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:56.086
THEM ON LIFE'S THE LIFE SUPPORT

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:58.555
SYSTEM DIALYSIS DOM'S.

00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:01.158
MEDICALLY -- HE THOSE SAY WHAT

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:02.192
DOES IT LOOK LIKE I MEAN I I'VE

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:02.726
HEARD SOME COMMERCIALS.

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:03.894
THEY'VE BEEN OUT THERE TRYING TO

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:05.696
START THE PROCESS AS PROCESS OF

00:46:05.762 --> 00:46:10.200
EDUCATING THE THERE'S LITERALLY --

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:10.834
YOU KNOW MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:11.635
THERE WHO DON'T.

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:12.436
WE NEED SOMEWHERE TO COMMUNICATE

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.371
DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO LET THEM

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:14.972
KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.473
TO BE.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.175
SO I'M NOT EVADING YOUR QUESTION

00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.977
I'LL GET TO IT IMMEDIATELY BUT I

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:20.944
WANT TO SAY WHEN SUBMIT SAYING

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:22.679
GETS HERE HE CAN GIVE YOU THIS

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.214
TO YOU IN GREAT DETAIL SO IF YOU

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:26.650
HAVE TIME WHEN HE COMES. TO BE

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:27.918
INVITED BACK THAT WOULD BE GOOD

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:29.887
BUT THE THIS IS THE IMPORTANT

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:31.155
QUESTION.

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:32.656
FIRST OF ALL WHY SHUT OFF THE

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:34.691
POWER -- AND THIS IS A QUESTION

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.026
OF PRIORITIES.

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.327
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP IT SAFE FOR

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:38.896
THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THE

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:40.731
SYSTEM HUMAN LIFE HAS TO BE OUR

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.633
HIGHEST PRIORITY.

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:43.167
AND SO THAT'S THE THINKING

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:44.334
BEHIND THIS.

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:47.037
WE WERE WELL PREPARED LAST YEAR.

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.272
THAT WAS OBVIOUS WERE BETTER

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.973
PREPARED THIS YEAR MUCH BETTER

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:50.707
PREPARE.

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:54.211
MUCH BETTER DIAGNOSTIC ABILITY --

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:55.345
AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.780
PERIODICITY WITH WHICH WE WILL

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.015
DO THIS BUT WE HAVE SPENT A

00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:00.184
GREAT DEAL OF TIME PREPARING FOR

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.619
THIS -- AND WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.621
GOVERNMENTS LOCAL EMS SO THAT

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:05.956
PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHERE TO GO.

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.257
WE ARE.

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:10.060
INTENT ON GIVING A LOT OF

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.428
ADVANCE NOTICE.

00:47:11.495 --> 00:47:12.663
WE LIKE TO GIVE FORTY EIGHT

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.598
HOURS IF WE CAN REPEATED AT

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:15.599
TWENTY FOUR AND THEN IMMEDIATELY

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:16.967
BEFORE THE EVENT.

00:47:17.034 --> 00:47:18.101
WE ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.736
GOVERNMENTS TO SAY CAN WE SET UP

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.038
A SHELTER IN THIS GYMNASIUM WERE

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.706
IDENTIFYING.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:25.008
MEDICAL NEED PATIENCE SO I THINK

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:25.776
WE'RE DOING ALL THE RIGHT THINGS

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:26.410
HERE.

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:27.811
THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.046
COORDINATION TO GO.

00:47:29.112 --> 00:47:31.582
BUT I THINK WE WE CERTAINLY

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:32.349
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE.

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:34.284
AND I THINK WE'RE DOING ALL THE

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:34.918
RIGHT THINGS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:35.652
READY.

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:37.721
SO LAST YEAR THEY ACTUALLY SHUT

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:38.689
THE POWER OFF.

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:41.692
BEFORE WE HAD -- THE EVENTS AND

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:42.526
I KNOW.

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:44.161
DOCTOR WOODS IN MY DISTRICT BUT

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.796
WAS FORTY HE'S BEFORE CAME BACK

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:48.765
ON SO NOBODY WAS EXPECTING WITH

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:50.901
THE WIND OF IT WAS OVER.

00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:52.669
HE WAS GONE AND WAS FOUR DAYS

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:55.038
LATER THAT FARMERS WERE TRYING

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:56.873
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.575
TO WHAT OTHER FIELDS I MEAN I

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.277
WAS GETTING CALLS LIKE CRAZY.

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:00.844
OF PEOPLE LIKE WHEN IS IT

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.246
ACTUALLY COME BACK ON SO I GUESS

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:04.147
FOR ME I WANT I WANT TO BE ABLE

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.515
TO BE SAFE.

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:07.484
AND I WANT TO AVOID THOSE RISKY

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.920
TIMES BUT THOSE TIMES ARE SHORT

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.055
WINDOWS THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.457
SHUT THE POWER DOWN.

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:14.758
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.960
OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA SS BECAUSE

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:18.228
WHAT I I CALL ACTUALLY CALLED.

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.997
P. JEANNIE MYSELF AND SAID ONE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.365
OF MY GONNA GET POWER BACK ON MY

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:21.832
DISTRICT.

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.133
AND HE SAID AS SOON AS WE SURVEY

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.835
EVERY SINGLE LINE AS YOU JUST

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:26.236
STATED IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS

00:48:26.303 --> 00:48:27.738
THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:28.939
MILES OF LINES OUT THERE.

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.274
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TALKING

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.342
ABOUT JUST AREAS THAT ARE SHUT

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.410
DOWN BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:35.312
SORT OF A SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:36.513
GOING TO BE FOUR DAYS EVERY TIME

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.282
THE AS THE NEXT OF IT PRETTY

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:39.016
COULD BE EIGHT DAYS WITHOUT

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:40.350
POWER.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.418
AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE EITHER

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:43.587
IS WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM IN

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.690
PLACE THAT ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.257
TO SHUT THE POWER OFF DURING

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.191
THOSE.

00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:49.293
EVENTS WHERE WE HAVE WE KNOW

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.227
THERE'S A HIGH RISK AND THEN BE

00:48:50.294 --> 00:48:51.261
ABLE TO GET IT BACK ON IN A

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:53.563
FASHION WHERE PEOPLE ARE TOTALLY

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.765
IMPACTED AS WELL THE SAME TIME

00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:55.065
[inaudible]

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.267
SO.

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.101
WHEN I HEARD THAT THE

00:48:58.168 --> 00:48:59.936
RESTORATION TIME WAS TWO AND A

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:03.740
HALF TO FOUR DAYS -- I HAVE TO

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:07.110
SAY MY I WAS MY JOB DROPPED --

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.712
BUT AND THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE

00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:10.414
BUT THIS IS A FACT THE

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.784
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WAS BUILT.

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.354
TO REMAIN IN SERVICE.

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:18.121
RIGHT THE FOCUS IS ALWAYS BAD

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:20.590
AND HOW DO YOU KEEP IT WORKING

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.792
NINETY NINE POINT 999% OF THE

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:22.926
TIME.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.494
AND TURNING IT OFF IS NOT

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:26.196
SOMETHING WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:28.298
WITH YOU KNOW WE STARTED BACK IN

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:29.800
WHEN THERE'S A FAILURE BUT SO

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:30.834
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:33.170
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS AND I

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:35.872
WILL SAY THE THE PHYSICS.

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.007
I DON'T GET TOO FAR TO PHYSICS

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.742
BUT THE PHYSICS OF RE ENERGIZING

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.844
A TRANSMISSION SYSTEM ARE NOT A

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.979
SIMPLE DISTRICTS WHICH THERE ARE

00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:45.215
SOME COMPLEXITY TO THIS.

00:49:45.282 --> 00:49:47.117
NONE OF THAT GOES TO THE POINT

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:49.786
OF FOUR DAYS IS RIDICULOUS HI

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:50.020
KATHY.

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.321
YEAH I AGREE WITH THAT I THINK

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.723
WE'RE BETTER SHAPE.

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:54.424
OVER TIME THERE ARE AS A QUICK

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.193
MEANT YOU CAN INSTALL ON THE

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:58.562
LINE THAT'S IN THE PLAN THAT

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:01.164
MAKES THIS A LOT EASIER.

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:01.732
I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THOSE

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:03.367
DETAILS BUT WE WILL DO BETTER

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:06.636
THIS YEAR.

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.939

PLANS AND THEN THE OTHER TWO

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.384
UTILITIES WILL BE HERE AS WELL.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.118
TO TALK ABOUT THEIR

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:25.489
IMPLEMENTATION WHICH INCLUDES --

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:28.058
DINNER DISEASE.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.826
THAT WAS GOOD.

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.094
SO WITH SO THE NO WAY BECAUSE

00:50:31.161 --> 00:50:31.728

IN ADDITION TO SAVING HUMAN LIFE

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.841
IS ALSO THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA THAT

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.942
PEOPLE HAVE LIVED THROUGH.

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:48.512

EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYBODY

00:54:21.157 --> 00:54:24.694
INVOLVED -- BUT BUT WE ARE NOW

00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:26.696
STOCKTON AS A CITY IS NOW ON THE

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.264
RACE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:30.266
VERY STRATEGICALLY REBUILD FROM

00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:32.602
WHERE WE WERE.

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.304
AND YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THE

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:35.772
DECISIONS PEOPLE MADE AND HOW

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.907
THEY LEAD TO THE CITY BEING IN A

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.643
MUCH STRONGER POSITION NOW.

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:41.244
WHEN YOU WE P. GINNY WHAT WE

00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.214
LOOK TO TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE?

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.583
LEFT A BETTER THAN YOU FOUND.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:47.917
GREAT QUESTION.

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:50.186
FIRST OF ALL NO MORE THESE BIG

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:51.721
EVENTS.

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.223
THAT'S GOT TO BE THE FIRST THING

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:54.290
AND IF YOU LOOK AT I MEAN.

00:54:54.357 --> 00:54:55.825
LOOK AT THE HISTORY OVER THE

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.227
LAST TWENTY YEARS OF REPETITION

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.695
OF EVENTS.

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:00.096
THIS IS THE THIRD BANKRUPTCY

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.631
INVOLVING P. JEANNIE ONE WAS A

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:03.700
SUBSIDIARY BUT THIS IS NUMBER

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.300
THREE I THINK THERE'S BEEN SIX

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:07.470
IN THE ENTIRE UTILITY INDUSTRY

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:08.538
OVER TIME SO.

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:14.144
AND THEIR EVENT DRIVEN -- SO

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.113
FIRST THING.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.315
WE HAVE TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.483
IN A WAY THAT PROHIBITS BUT YOU

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:22.652
CAN'T PROHIBIT BUT MINIMIZES THE

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:24.054
OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE EVENTS.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.522
AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH SAFETY

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:27.090
CULTURE PAYING ATTENTION TO

00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:29.159
DETAIL RISK IDENTIFICATION RISK

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:30.160
MITIGATION.

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.594
ASSET PRIORITIZATION

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.630
UNDERSTANDING YOUR BUSINESS SO

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:34.964
FIRST THAT'S FIRST.

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:36.132
LET US LEARN HOW TO RUN THE

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.834
BUSINESS ABOUT HAVING THESE BIG

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:39.169
RISK.

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:41.037
TO LET THIS SO WE'RE TALKING

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.539
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF LIKE THIS

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:43.707
TOO IF WE'VE LOST A RETAIN OUR

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:47.544
POSITION AS THE LEADER OF THE

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.878
CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:49.512
I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:49.979
TO DO THAT I THINK THE

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.148
BANKRUPTCY WILL AFFECT THAT A

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.850
LITTLE BIT IN THE SHORT TERM.

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:55.719
AND THREE SO I BELIEVE IN

00:55:55.785 --> 00:55:58.121
REDEMPTION.

00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:00.490
NOW WHAT SOME REDEMPTION FOR PGA

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:01.925

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:03.860
THE CUSTOMERS AND THE PEOPLE IN

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:04.994
THIS BUILDING AND ELSEWHERE

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:05.295
[inaudible]

00:56:05.361 --> 00:56:07.130
EARN REDEMPTION.

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.998
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'D.

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:09.566
I DON'T ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:12.402
LEGACY.

THANK YOU LITTLE HUBRIS INVOLVED

CONCEPT AS YOU SAID OF LEAVING

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:17.540
IT BETTER THAN IF.

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.209
WE COULD DO THAT.

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:25.181
HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE -- HOW

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.649

DO NOT INCOME HERE.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:41.898

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.033
SHORT THING [inaudible]

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.036

THERE'S A BIG FIX.

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:08.825

I THINK TRUST IS A WORD THAT

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:54.037
OFTEN COMES UP IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.439

FACING -- SO THAT AT THE END OF

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.534
THE DAY WE WORK TOWARDS

PROTECTING CALIFORNIA PAIRS.

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:31.107
AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS TRUST

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:31.608
WITHIN THE PUBLIC IN THE

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:33.576
LEGISLATURE.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:34.644
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION -- I

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:35.845
MADE MY FIRST.

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:39.148
TRIP TO CAPITOL HILL IN.

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:39.716
NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE INTO A

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:42.886
STATE LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:43.686
EIGHTY FOUR AND I'M ONE OF THE

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:45.088
ODD CEOS I THINK WHO.

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.456
LIKES.

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:48.024
THIS.

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:49.259
I LIKE DEALING WITH THE MEDIA I

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:50.994
LIKE DEALING IN THE POLITICAL

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.130
SPACE IT'S NOT ALWAYS PLEASANT --

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:56.165
BUT IT ISN'T DEMOCRACY ON THE

00:58:56.232 --> 00:59:00.603
MARCH SO -- I'M HOPING TO SEE A

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.206
LOT OF YOU PART OF THAT WILL BE

00:59:03.273 --> 00:59:04.841
ON YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SEE ME --

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.876
BUT I AM NO STRANGER TO THE

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:08.611
PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:11.915
THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN.

00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:13.216
UTILITY REGULATION THE

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.184
LEGISLATURE.

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:16.552
SO.

00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:18.354
I HOPE NOT TO BE A STRANGER THAT

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:20.056
WOULD SAY THAT.

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:23.860
ON THE ISSUE OF TRUST YOU KNOW.

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:25.094
HOW DO YOU BUILD TRUST THERE'S A

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.529
COUPLE WAYS YOU DO THIS THE

00:59:26.596 --> 00:59:27.997
FIRST THING IS SAY WHAT YOU'RE

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:29.499
GOING TO DO AND DO IT?

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:32.502
RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S TELL THAT TO

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:33.736
MY DAD HAD TO SAY WHICH I HAVE

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:35.705
IT HERE TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.006
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.574
AND SO THAT'S PART OF TRUST TELL

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.043
THE TRUTH -- IF SOMETHING BAD

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.377
HAPPENS [inaudible]

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:43.579
OWNER.

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:44.914
DON'T COVERED UP.

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.749
CONDUCT YOUR BUSINESS IN A WAY

00:59:46.816 --> 00:59:49.018
THAT YOU CAN BE PROUD OF AND

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:50.320
WE'VE HAD SOME INSTANCES OF

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.055
THINGS THE NOBODY CAN BE PROUD

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:54.991
OF AND I THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:56.392
METAL BUT THINK WE TEND OVER

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:57.460
COMPLICATE THINGS THE THINGS

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:59.629
LIKE TRUST.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:00.229
ARE YOU GOING TO DO SAID YOU

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.965
GOTTA DO DID YOU MAKE SENSE WHEN

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.566
YOU SAID IT DID YOU SOCIALIZE

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.668
THE IDEA AND THEN DID YOU DO.

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.736
SO IF I TELL YOU I'M GONNA DO

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.571
THE BEST I CAN TO PREVENT A FIRE

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.406
AGAIN YOU CAN COUNT ON IT BEING

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.041
TRUE NOW WHETHER I WILL SUCCEED

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.309
OR NOT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:14.610
BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW WE

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.179
REBUILD TRUST AND I KNOW IT'S

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:20.249
GOING TO TAKE AWHILE -- WE'VE

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:21.851
ALREADY STARTED THIS THIS IS

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.520
ABOUT A SET OF BEHAVIORS -- A

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.456
SET OF COMMITMENTS WE MAKE EVERY

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.690
DAY HERE'S A WE'RE GONNA DO OUR

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:29.926
BUSINESS.

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:30.526
AND WE GET A LINE GOING TO FIX

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:31.627
IT.

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:32.695
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.564
CHALLENGES -- I TELL YOU WHAT

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:36.699
I'M FOCUSED ON FOCUSED IN THE

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.134
SHORT TERM AT THE MALL.

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:39.736
SO I'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON THE

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.738
WILD SIDE FIRE SAFETY PLAN.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:42.672
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.773
THERE ARE SO MANY ACRONYMS

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.342
FLYING AROUND ON THIS THAT I'M

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:47.710
NOT SURE I CAN KEEP ALL STRAIGHT.

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:50.246
THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING --

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:51.914
PARTICULARLY THE INSPECTION AND

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.416
REPAIR WORK.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.719
WHICH IS A TREMENDOUSLY LARGE

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:59.489
TASK IN A VERY ROBUST PROCESS SO

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.056
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE SHORT

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:00.857
TERM AT THE MOMENT.

THE SAN BRUNO PIPELINE EXPLOSION

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:53.976
HELPED IDENTIFY SOME OF THE

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:55.845

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.823
OF IDENTIFYING VICTIMS.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.591
BUT ALL OF THOSE.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.626
HAVE A LINK [inaudible] TO

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:14.197
UTILITY.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:15.898
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AFTER THE

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.600
SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION IN TWO

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.803
THOUSAND AND TEN THAT THE

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.571
COMPANY MIGHT HAVE TAKEN

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:22.205
APPROACH.

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.974
WOW IF OUR GAS LINES ARE LIKE

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.175
THIS MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.911
LOOKING AT EVERYTHING.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.480
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT HAPPENED.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.748
IF IT DID -- CERTAINLY WASN'T

01:02:32.815 --> 01:02:34.550
PUBLICIZED.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:38.020
SO AS WE GO IN TO YOUR TENURE

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.158
ALL OF THESE ALL OF THESE

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.493
THOUSANDS OF MILES OF LINES

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:44.627
THERE.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.595
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:48.731
EVERYTHING [inaudible]

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:51.868
BECAUSE I THINK CAN WE COULD

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.536
MISTER MISTER GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.606
IN TWO THOUSAND TEN TO REALLY DO

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:58.307
THAT ON A BROADER BASIS.

01:02:58.374 --> 01:02:59.842
AND I JUST WANNA I JUST WANT TO

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.410
KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:03.346
EVERYTHING.

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.615
ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.083
UTILITY.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.818
WELL FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:10.086
SORRY TO HAVE GIVEN YOU THOSE

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:13.055
OPPORTUNITIES TO IDENTIFY BODIES

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.057
AS A TERRIBLE.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:18.628
AND MARK MY EXPOSURE TO THOSE

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.228
THREE PLACES THAT THAT IS JUST

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:19.629
OF NOT.

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:22.465
I'LL NEVER GET OVER SO JUST.

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.100
AND I THINK YOUR ASSESSMENT IS

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:27.103
CORRECT -- I THINK WHEN SAN

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.738
BRUNO HAPPENED.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:30.640
ALL EVERYBODY WAS FOCUSED ON

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.408
FIXING THAT.

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:37.046
AND SO FIXED A SYMPTOM A BIG

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:38.981
SYMPTOM BUT MAYBE IT AND FOCUS

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.550
ON THE DISEASE.

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:43.186
OF AND I THINK A LITTLE BEHIND

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:44.921
ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE I THINK.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.189
THINK EMPIRICALLY YOU COULD

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:49.926
DEMONSTRATE THIS -- ARE WE

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:52.695
LOOKING AT EVERYTHING.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:53.930
WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING NOW

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.097
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A LEVEL OF

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:56.499
GRANULARITY THAT I DON'T THINK

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:59.068
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY IS

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.536
DONE MAYBE SAN DIEGO BUT WE'RE

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.038
LOOKING AT EVERYTHING AND WE

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.573
WILL LOOK AT EVERYTHING.

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.608
AND WE WILL LOOK AT THE GAS AND

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.475
ELECTRIC SYSTEMS AT THE SAME

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:06.909
TIME.

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.945
SO THEY'LL BE NO DIMINUTION AN

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.513
EFFORT IN THE GAS SIDE.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.614
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GAS SIDE

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:15.284
PERFORMANCE TODAY IS PRETTY GOOD.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.186
YOU KNOW THEY THEY GOT GOT IT

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.021
RIGHT THERE DOING PRETTY WELL

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:19.622
THEY HAVE OCCASIONAL HICK UPS

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.523
THAT.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.292
KIND OF EMBARRASSING BUT BUT THE

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.561
ELECTRIC SIDE WERE BEHIND WHERE

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.530
THEY ARE.

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.631
ON THE GAS SIDE AND WE'LL CATCH

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:35.838
UP.

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.073

ESPECIALLY WITH THE GROWING --

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.631
PROPORTION OF ENERGY BEING

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:04.433
PROCURED BY -- COMMITTEE CHOICE

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:05.968

IT'S MUCH MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:09.972
46%.

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.875
OF P. GENIES ELECTRICITY LOAD IS

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.143
PROCURED BY.

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.579
KIMI CHOICE AGGREGATORS AS RAY

WE'RE AS YOU STARTED OFF TALKING

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:34.430
ABOUT SAFETY BEING YOUR NUMBER

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:35.231
ONE PRIORITY AND I THINK.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:38.701
YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS THAT THE

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:39.902

COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:42.905
JUST EMPHASIZE THAT PUBLIC

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:47.009
SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN.

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.612
WOOD -- NARROWING P. GENIES

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:52.114
SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES TO

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.383
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION --

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:56.519
ALLOW PEAS YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:59.121
INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY.

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:02.258
AND GREAT MANAGEMENT.

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.894

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.929
COMMUNITY AGGREGATION.

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:08.831
THAT'S ABOUT AS DEEP AS I GO BUT

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:11.934
THERE WASN'T REALLY A QUESTION --

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:15.137
THERE ARE VERY LARGE COMPANIES

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.706
IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS REGION

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:19.909
IN THIS CITY.

01:06:19.975 --> 01:06:22.278
THERE ARE WELL MANAGED

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:22.578
[inaudible]

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.914
AND SO.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.215
I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.684
WOULD IT HELP.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:31.354
PGA ANY TO SHED SOME ASSETS --

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.955
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE GOING TO

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:36.492
FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS -- I THINK.

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:37.727
WE'LL BE ABLE TO MANAGE ALL

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.261
THOSE THINGS.

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:40.763
HISTORICALLY GENERATION

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.732
TRANSMISSION.

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:43.766
I DON'T THINK THIS IS A

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.502
MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY QUESTION.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.603
THAT -- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.405
FOCUS ON ALL THESE THINGS NOW I

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.773
DON'T KNOW.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.008
WHAT THE BEST ANSWER FINANCIALLY

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.477
FOR CUSTOMERS IS ME MY RIGHT

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:56.479
BEHIND SAFETY FOR ME IS CUSTOMER

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:57.646
IMPACT?

01:06:57.713 --> 01:07:01.717
I AM PRO CONSUMER ALSO AND THAT.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:02.952
OFTEN HARD TO BE IN THIS

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.321
BUSINESS BUT I AM BUT YOU KNOW A

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.756
LOT OF I KNOW PEOPLE ARE

DIVEST OF GENERATION OR

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.260
MUNICIPAL LIES.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:12.461
BECAUSE WE CAN'T MANAGE OUR

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:13.696
BUSINESS I THINK THE BETTER

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:14.530
THING FOR US TO DO IS

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.765
DEMONSTRATE TO WE CAN MANAGE THE

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.900

NEW TO CALIFORNIA BUT CCA'S IS A

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:27.576
ACRONYM THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:28.544
HEARING A LOT ABOUT.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:34.016
AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S NOT JUST --

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.919
TO NATO A HYPOTHETICAL BUT IT IS.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.554
YOU KNOW ALMOST HALF OF P.

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:43.626
JEANNIE -- THE PC PROJECTED 80%.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:47.296
I BELIEVE -- IN THE NEAR FUTURE --

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:52.134
AND SO -- YEAH I A WAY WHICH IS

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:53.369
TO I I BELIEVE THAT.

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:55.905
THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF OUR

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:57.606
FOCUSES ON WHETHER THE

01:07:57.673 --> 01:08:00.910
TRADITIONAL ROLE OF UTILITIES --

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:03.679
HOW THAT WOULD -- INVOLVED WITH

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:05.681
THE RISE OF THESE CCA'S.

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:08.451
AND SO MAYBE I CAN COME BACK IN

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:09.385
TWO WEEKS WHEN I'M TWO WEEKS

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.085
SMARTER.

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.389
OF ACTION.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.591
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE FALL

01:08:48.657 --> 01:08:53.295
TEST GO SQUARELY ON PGA ANY.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.831

THE THE FACT THAT THE TRACK

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.188
RECORD FALLS SHORT OF WHAT P.

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:22.691
GENIES CUSTOMERS DESERVE.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:24.426

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.196
POWER ON TVA'S COAL DEPENDENT

THAT CONCERNS ME I UNDERSTAND

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:45.548
THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN COAL.

01:09:45.614 --> 01:09:46.615
DURING YOUR TENURE I RECOGNIZE

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:50.185

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.120
BUT CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT.

THEN THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:29.959
THE BOARD MEMBERS WOULD BE

IN ONE LAST COMMENT.

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:10.859
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE GAS LINES I

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:12.261
THINK MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ABOUT

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:14.963

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:32.114
SURGEON COMES IN TO SEE YOU AND

IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH NOT ON THE

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.193

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:47.396
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TO

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.098
WORK ON POLICY THAT'S GOING TO

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:49.998
PROTECT.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.767
THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.069
SERVED IN THIS CASE BY KEY G.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.037
ANY.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.906
SO MY QUESTION THEN IS JUST AS

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:59.842
WE WERE DOWN SKATE PRESIDENT

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:02.111
JUST AS WE WOULD ASK ANYONE ELSE

I DO WANT TO HEAR.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.256
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND I

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:15.991

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:19.561
I'M GOING TO TALK TO PEOPLE FIND

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:22.164
OUT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.465
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A HUNDRED

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.700
DAYS TOO LATE.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.101
I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.870
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:30.172
THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED DAYS.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.841
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:33.509
BECAUSE IT WOULD THEY WOULD NOT

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:35.177
HAVE BROUGHT TO WIN UNLESS YOU

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.779

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.080
KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU SHARED WITH

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:39.181

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.816
AND THE WE'VE READ ABOUT.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.552
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT WILL HAPPEN

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:44.987
NOW IN THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED DAYS

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.722
THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:50.459
BECAUSE I FOR ONE WANT TO KNOW.

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.661
WHETHER OR NOT YOU DID IT.

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:57.733
WHEN WE COME BACK TO EVALUATE

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.033
[inaudible]

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.668
THANK YOU.

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:01.637
PERHAPS I CAN START WITH A

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:04.540
LITTLE BIT ABOUT TV.

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:07.576
I THINK HERE YOU PROBABLY EXPECT

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.311
YOUR UTILITIES TO FOLLOW THE

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.946
LAWS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:13.849
RULES OF THE CPUC.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.918
AND THE SAME IS TRUE TV ATV IS A

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.153
CREDIT AS A CREATURE OF A

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.254
FEDERAL STATUTE.

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.557
PASSED IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:25.160
AND THE TV A ACCESS THE PRIMARY.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.362
THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF TVA IS

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.931
TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AT THE

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:32.000
LOWEST FEASIBLE RATE.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.869
THAT'S THAT IS THE EXACT

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.137
LANGUAGE AND IS SUPPLEMENTED BY

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:36.205
SAYING.

01:14:36.271 --> 01:14:38.140
WHEN YOU ADD RESOURCES YOU HAVE

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:41.410
TO ADD THE LOWEST COST RESOURCE

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:41.977
FOR YOU GET THE LOWER SYSTEM

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:43.045
COST?

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.113
AND SO THAT IS HOW THEY ENDED UP

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.181
WITH THE SYSTEM THEY HAD WHICH

01:14:46.248 --> 01:14:47.883
WAS COLD DEPEND.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.718
NOW WHAT HAPPENED IN MY TENURE

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:51.019
THERE AND A LITTLE BIT BEFORE

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:52.020
THAT AS WE WERE TIRED A LOT OF

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:54.089
THAT PLACE TO WITH SOME NUCLEAR

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.724
SOME GAS.

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:58.660
MORE HYDRO AND MORE RENEWAL.

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.028
SO TODAY.

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:03.966
TVA 60% NOT AMENDING HEADER G..

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.367
AND THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS KIND

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:07.769
AND HAPPENED TO BE 70% REDUCED

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.104
IN FIVE YEARS.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.140
AND SO TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:13.909
THE LOWEST COST OPTION.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.310
WAS ACTUALLY A I THINK A PRETTY

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:17.045
GOOD BODY OF WORK BY THE PEOPLE

01:15:17.112 --> 01:15:19.548
THERE.

01:15:19.615 --> 01:15:20.983
THE POLICY HERE IS DIFFERENT THE

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:22.217
POLICY HERE IS CLEANER AND

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:23.685
GREENER.

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:26.188
THE THE TV A TV A ACT COULDN'T

01:15:26.255 --> 01:15:28.790
BE CLEARER ABOUT WHAT.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:33.495
TVA WAS POSTED IT -- THERE'S A

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:36.031
PRETTY GOOD.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.634
IS A STANDARD LINE OF MINE I

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.702
WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.

01:15:40.769 --> 01:15:42.404
I'VE SEEN THE COMMERCIAL.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.106
BUT WHEN I EVALUATE PEOPLE

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:47.175
INTERNALLY.

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.077
PRETTY GOOD IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:49.611
I'M EVER GOING TO TELL HIM

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.246
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.583
TO GIVE TOO MUCH CREDIT -- SO

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.585
BUT THAT'S SLIP ON MY PART.

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.453
CELEBRITY ADDRESS THE GAS SYSTEM

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.622
PERFORMANCE ITS TOP QUARTILE IN

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.191
THE INDUSTRY IN MANY REGARDS

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:04.927
INCLUDING IN THE SAFETY PIECE.

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.862
SO THE GUESTS BUSINESS THE GAS

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.664
SYSTEM HERE IS ROBUST WELL

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.532
MANAGE THE RISKS ARE IDENTIFIED

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.567
IN MITIGATED SO.

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.735
IT'S WELL BEYOND PRETTY GOOD

01:16:13.802 --> 01:16:17.339
IT'S IT'S IT'S RIGHT UP THERE IN

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.141
THE TOP QUARTILE OF GAS SYSTEMS

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:21.143
IN THE COUNTRY SO.

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:25.647
THE LESSONS LEARNED -- WILL PART

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:26.648
OF THIS I DISCUSSED WITH HER

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:29.685
COLLEAGUES YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:30.185
THE DISEASE NOT JUST THE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.987
SYMPTOMS.

01:16:32.054 --> 01:16:33.522
AND THE DISEASE.

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.223
WAS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AND

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:36.858
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:39.127
CONDITION OF THE ASSETS

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:39.428
[inaudible]

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:45.701
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IN SEPTEMBER --

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:46.902
HAPPEN IS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.270
THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE DIDN'T

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.639
KNOW HOW LONG IT BEEN THERE ALL

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:51.239
THAT SO THAT'S WHY IT HAPPENED

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.140
SO.

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:53.208
THE REAL LESSON LEARNED IS

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.343
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:56.545
THAT'S THE LAST.

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.013
WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE EVERYDAY FOR

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.982
PROVIDING GAS ELECTRIC SERVICE

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:00.782
AND OTHER THINGS TO PEOPLE IN A

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.751
SAFE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE MATTER

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.453
THAT IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:08.423
AND WHEN YOU STRAY FROM THAT.

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.059
YOU HAVE EVENTS LIKE SAM ROAD --

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.128
WE GET DISTRACTED WE FOCUS ON I

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.030
DON'T KNOW WHAT.

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.832
BUT THE FIRST THING I'M GOING TO

01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:19.468
DO IS BRING AN INTENSE FOCUS.

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.737
BACK TO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:24.239
OPERATING UTILITY SYSTEM.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.074
RIGHT CLEAR ROLES CLEAR

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.943
ACCOUNTABILITY CLEAR STANDARD OF

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.278
WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:31.646
AND I'VE ALREADY SEEN OUR NUMBER

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:34.316
PLACES WHERE.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:36.618
WE'RE NOT EVEN PRETTY GOOD --

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:38.120
THAT WE LAGGED THE INDUSTRY IN

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:40.822
SOME IMPORTANT.

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:44.926
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS I'M GOING.

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.695
TO USE INDUSTRY BENCHMARK TOP

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.030
QUARTILE PERFORMANCES ARE

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:49.865
MEASURE.

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:52.000
SO EVERYTHING WE DO AN ELECTRIC

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.335
GAS BUSINESSES MEASURE.

01:17:53.402 --> 01:17:54.503
AND PEOPLE KEEP TRACK OF THE

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.771
INDUSTRY AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.040
DRIVE TOWARD TOP QUARTILE

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:58.640
PERFORMANCE AND EVERY ONE OF

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:01.443
THOSE -- WE HAVE TO GET A LOT OF

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.845
INTERNAL PROCESS SEES AND OTHER

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:06.448
THINGS STRAIGHTENED OUT -- BUT

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.584
TO ME THIS IS AN EXERCISE.

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.386
IN RETURNING TO MASTERY OF THE

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.121
FUNDAMENTALS OF THE BUSINESS

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:13.889
BECAUSE A VERY FUNDAMENTAL

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:18.927
BUSINESS -- SO THAT'S LIKE THE

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:19.227

AND A SERVICE PROVIDER THE

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:35.010
CUSTOMERS CAN BE PROUD OF THAT'S

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:39.081
IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GOOD

01:18:39.147 --> 01:18:40.449
PLACE TO BE AND A HARD PLACE FOR

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:45.687
US TO GET.

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.255
IT IN.

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.957

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.132
ROBUST.

VISUALLY INSPECTING ALL

IN THE STOCK AROUND THE TV A

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.002
COVERAGE THE PGA ANY COVERAGE I

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:08.069

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:14.042
ABOUT THAT.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:14.843
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:23.919

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.708
BEGINNING.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.476
THE VERY HARSH.

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:49.611
I THINK.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.614

PAULA JESSICA CAME OFF AS HARSH --

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:24.279

01:21:40.128 --> 01:21:42.264
QUESTION I THINK THAT -- IT'S

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:43.565
SAFE TO SAY THAT.

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.400
WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM AS

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:47.235
WORD ALWAYS COMES FROM?

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.437
AND IT WILL PROBABLY FALL ON THE

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.406
REPAIRS MORE THAN LIKELY --

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:52.707
THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:54.342
CONFIGURATIONS OF HOW THAT

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.611
ULTIMATELY TAKES FORM BUT I'VE

EARLY CONTRACTS.

FOR SOLAR WAS TWENTY TWO CENTS.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.197
FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW YOU CAN

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:57.932
BUY SOLAR FOR ABOUT THREE CENTS

01:23:57.999 --> 01:23:58.900
AND SO.

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.168
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT

BUSINESS OF SAVING THIS CAUGHT

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.041
ME AT THE SAME TIME?

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:09.444
RIGHT WHICH THAT IS PART OF YOUR

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.446
ROLE AS THE AS THE HEAD OF THE

MAYBE ADDRESS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.417
ARE ON ON THOSE THAT THERE'S A

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:16.918
LOT OF EMPLOYEES AND PEOPLE THAT

AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AS WELL.

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:24.559
SO YOU START OUT BY DEFINING

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.127
BANKRUPTCY.

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.129

FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN PAY

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.303
AND THEN ALLOCATED THAT'S THE

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.971
THAT'S THE BASIC PROCESS.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:39.007
AS PART OF THIS.

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:41.142
CONTRACTS ARE REVIEWABLE.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.644
AND I AM NOT EVADING YOUR

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.345
QUESTION OR ANY OF THOSE THINGS

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:45.847

DECISION AND NO CLOSE TO A

01:24:48.516 --> 01:24:49.050
DECISION ON THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:24:49.117 --> 01:24:51.886
THE JUST WE KNOW IT'S OUT THERE.

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:54.989
THERE IS A DISPUTE BETWEEN.

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.524
THE C. P. WATER OF IS A DISPUTE

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.092
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.561
WHO'S ACTUALLY IN CHARGE OF THIS

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:02.197
QUESTION THE FOR THE CP YOU SEE

01:25:02.263 --> 01:25:05.266
THE BANKRUPTCY COURT -- I DON'T

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:06.367
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.236
AND I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M. FOR BE

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.504
IT FOR ME TO GET IN THE WAY OF

01:25:09.571 --> 01:25:10.605
YOUR TRYING TO ANSWER THIS

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:13.775
QUESTION BUT I THINK WE TRIED --

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.010
TO ESTABLISH AT THE ONSET THAT

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.512
WE WERE NOT GOING.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.447
TO DRIFT INTO THE THE BANKRUPTCY

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:22.884
ISSUES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:26.387
AND SO -- NO THAT'S OKAY -- BUT

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.089
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.524
THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT SOME

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:30.124
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TALK

01:25:30.191 --> 01:25:31.659
ABOUT OUR OUR PART OF THE

CONVERSATION AND THOSE ARE YET

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:33.928
TO BE DETERMINED BUT IF YOU HAVE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.897

IMPORTANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS SO

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.003
I CAN THIS IS NOT A CASUAL.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.038
ISSUE FOR ME BUT WITH IS JUST

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:45.139
THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THAT

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:50.545
POINT YEAH [inaudible]

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:03.558
WHAT IS THIS GOING TO COST TO DO.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:05.293
THE INSPECTIONS OF EVERYTHING --

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.595

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:08.429
SIX HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:09.097
MILLION OF SUGGESTING JUST TO DO

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.164
ALL THE INSPECTIONS.

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.533
OR YOU TALK ABOUT REPAIRS AS

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:12.834

NOW SO THAT IS THE INSPECTION

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:19.173
AND REPAIRS BOTH -- AND THAT

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.543
INCLUDES LIKE TREE TREMAYNE AND

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:22.777
AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL OR IS

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:24.012
THERE YET SO THERE ARE THERE

01:26:24.078 --> 01:26:26.881
ADDITIONAL LAYERS THAT THE

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.283
WEATHER'S ALWAYS I'M SORRY I

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:30.685
MEAN -- YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS.

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:33.021
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE SHOULD

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:34.489
CALL THE TREE TRIMMING ITSELF

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:35.623
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.725
AND I THINK WE HAVE DOUBLE OUR

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.561
EFFORT IN THAT REGARD STARTING

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.296
IN LAST YEAR.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:42.864
THE SIXTY NINE HUNDRED HAS TO DO

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:44.232
WITH THE NEW PROGRAMS WE PUT IN

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:45.199
PLACE.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:47.035
AND THEY ARE INSPECTION AND

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:47.802
REPAIR.

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:50.939
AND THEY INVOLVE THE VISUAL BY A

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.574
TRAINED OBSERVER BUT ALSO WERE

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.876
USING DRONES.

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.411
IT TURNS OUT THE DRONES CAN SEE

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:58.580
A LOT BETTER THAN HUMANS CAN

01:26:58.646 --> 01:27:00.582
BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THE ANGLES --

01:27:00.648 --> 01:27:03.017
AND THIS THE DRONE WORK AND THE

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:04.352
HIGH RESOLUTION OF THE PICTURES.

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:06.354
AND THEN WE HAVE.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:08.056
LARGER ROOMS OF TRAINED

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:10.191
ENGINEERS AND OTHERS WHO CAN

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:11.593
LOOK AT THESE PICTURES AND SAY.

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.795
THERE'S A WASHER MISSING THERE

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.096
THERE'S A COTTER PIN THAT'S BAND.

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:16.931
SO IT'S BOTH INSPECTION AND

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:20.468
REPAIR AND AND IT'S A VERY HIGH

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:26.107
TECH KIND OF PROCESS

I THINK WE ALL NEED TO RECOGNIZE

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.052
THAT IT IS IN A VERY DIFFICULT.

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:39.821
SPOT.

INTO THE BANKRUPTCY AS PART OF

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:57.505
THIS.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.740
HELP HELP ME OUT OF THAT.

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:01.142
HOLE.

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:04.245
I PART OF BUILDING TRUST I THINK

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:06.080
IS TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING.

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:09.450
OF THE ERA LEADERS.

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:12.487
VISION AND IMAGINATION FOR WHAT

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:15.223
PGA ANY IS GOING TO BE.

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.724
I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN BE

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.127
FAULTED FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:20.662
YESTERDAY -- YOU HAVE A

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.864
CHALLENGE TO REALLY GET WRAPPED

AROUND TODAY WHAT'S GOING ON BUT

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.669
IF YOU'RE HERE FOR A WHILE IT'S

GOING TO BE THE TOMORROW THAT I

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.971
THINK.

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:30.571
ALL OF US ARE GOING TO WANT TO

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.106
BE.

01:28:32.173 --> 01:28:34.942
ENCOURAGED THAT THERE WILL BE A

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:37.111
A PGA ANY THAT IS IMAGINED AND

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.980
ACTUALLY.

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.348
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AN

01:28:40.415 --> 01:28:42.483
IMPROVED PERHAPS THAN BEFORE

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.552
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE WHAT DO YOU

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:47.121
ATTEMPTING TO TRY. TO DO AS THE

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:50.992
PERSON AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID.

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:53.027
TO REDESIGN AND PERHAPS

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:57.432
MODERNIZE AND REIMAGINE WHAT.

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.834
PGA ANY IS GONNA LOOK LIKE GO GO

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:02.003
I MEAN WHAT WE'RE NINETEEN YEARS

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:04.505
INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:06.674
WHERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.742
ON THE PLANET.

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:09.277
AND WE LITERALLY HAVE AN

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:11.279
ELECTRICITY GRID.

01:29:11.345 --> 01:29:13.848
THAT I THINK IS SLOWLY

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.982
DISINTEGRATING AND IT'S IT'S A

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:17.985
LOT OF CONCERN FOR MANY OF US.

01:29:18.052 --> 01:29:19.487
WHAT DO YOU SEE THE ROLE AS P.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.723
GENIE IN THE BIG PICTURE AND

01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:22.924
WHAT IT IN IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.292
ELECTRICITY?

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:25.626
SUPPLY.

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.261
AND WHAT DO YOU WHAT IS THE

01:29:27.328 --> 01:29:29.997
IMAGINATION GOING TO LOOK LIKE

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:31.299
WHAT IS THE NEW P. JEANNIE.

01:29:31.365 --> 01:29:33.634
LOOK LIKE WHETHER IT COMES OUT

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:34.869
OF BANKRUPTCY AYE.

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:37.271
THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER.

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:38.973
BUT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION YOUR

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:41.609
IMAGINATION AND YOUR HEART FELT

01:29:41.676 --> 01:29:45.146
DESIRE. TO FIX.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.582
HELLO FIRST OF ALL -- WHERE WE

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:48.816
ARE AT THE MOMENT IS SURVIVAL

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.385
MODE? TO BE FRANK ABOUT THIS

01:29:51.452 --> 01:29:53.187
RIGHT SO.

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:54.789
BEFORE I CAN IMAGINE TOO HARD I

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:57.158
GOTTA THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.826
AROUND TO BE IMAGINE RIGHT.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:29:59.794
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THE

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.262
FUTURE LOOKS LIKE CAN I TELL YOU

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:02.730
WHAT I THINK MAY I THINK IT

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.265
LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF MICRO GIVE

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:05.166
GRADES.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.001
MUCH MORE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:08.736
THIS.

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.238
THE FIND A GOOD FOR P. GENIES

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.405
BUSINESS MODEL AS WE KNOW IT

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:13.107
TODAY BUT THIS IS REALITY OF

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.509
CHANGE AND TECHNOLOGICAL

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.144
INNOVATION.

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:17.945
I THINK THE TRANSMISSION

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.981
BACKBONE IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH

01:30:20.047 --> 01:30:21.649
IS SERVED US WELL.

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.417
A IS ALSO ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:30:23.484 --> 01:30:25.119
VULNERABILITIES WE HAVE. TO THE

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:28.956
EXTENT YOU CAN LOCALIZE THINGS.

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.224
WE ARE GOING TO SEE CONTINUED

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:32.527
COST REDUCTIONS IN STORAGE WHEN

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.262
YOU CAN COMBINED SOLAR WITH

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:37.298
LOCAL STORAGE -- MAKES A BIG

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:39.033
DIFFERENCE SO I SEE A MUCH MORE

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.836
DISPERSED WORLD -- MUCH MORE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.571
LOCALIZED.

01:30:43.638 --> 01:30:45.173
SOME CENTRALIZED YOU'RE STILL

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.474
GOING TO NEED SOME SUPER

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.176
HIGHWAYS IN THE SYSTEM.

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:50.611
I THINK LESS AND LESS OF THAT

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:52.046
OVER TIME IS WAS GONNA LOOK LIKE.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.015
IN THAT CONTEXT.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:55.983
HOW DO YOU SEE?

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:56.751
ESSENTIALLY THIS

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.419
DECENTRALIZATION AND

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.421
LOCALIZATION.

01:31:00.488 --> 01:31:02.390
PLAY OUT WITH RESPECT TO

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:05.693
RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY.

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.762
WE SAY HERE.

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:10.431
THAT PARAMOUNT IN OUR POLICY IS

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.934
RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.069
I THINK UNFORTUNATELY FROM TIME

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.939
TO TIME WE PRODUCE POLICIES THAT

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:20.007
ACTUALLY.

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:22.210
REDUCE RELIABILITY AND SPIKE.

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:24.278
COSTS.

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:26.681
I CONCUR WITH YOU THAT I THINK

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:29.951
THIS -- DECENTRALIZATION AND AND

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.053
THESE MICROGRAMS AYE HI I THINK

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.956
THAT HAS SOME SOME REALITY THERE.

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:36.457
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHALLENGES

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:38.659
ARE FOR RELIABILITY AND FOR

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:42.230
PORTABILITY IN THAT CONTEXT?

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.165
THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE THE

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:45.533
SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.767
BECAUSE IT WAS THE CHEAPEST WAY

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:49.136
TO DO IT THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:50.671
RELIABLE WAY TO DO IT.

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:52.139
WHEN WE BUILT A SYSTEM IT

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.809
OPERATED OVER THE LAST? HUNDRED

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.745
YEARS FIFTY YEARS CENTRALIZATION.

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.780
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ALL THOSE

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:01.749
THINGS WORK -- THEY WORKED

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:03.117
MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITS OF

01:32:03.184 --> 01:32:04.886
TECHNOLOGY.

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:08.322
RIGHT THE HOW DO YOU SEND --

01:32:08.389 --> 01:32:10.291
ELECTRICITY OVER LONG DISTANCES

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:11.692
WE HAD TO GO FROM DIRECT CURRENT

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.960
ALTERNATING CURRENT THOSE KIND

01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:15.029
OF THING SO IT'S BEEN PRETTY

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:17.131
STATIC FOR A LONG TIME.

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:20.234
THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- IT

01:32:20.301 --> 01:32:23.437
OVER SOLAR PRICES ARE TODAY --

01:32:23.504 --> 01:32:24.872
HE I THINK THIS WILL CHANGE I

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:26.574
THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK OF

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:30.511
BEING ON THE FRONT EDGE OF THIS --

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.446
IT IS A FACT BUT IT'S A IT'S A

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.547
FACT.

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.882
TO THINK THE AVERAGE PGA ANY

01:32:34.949 --> 01:32:36.384
RATE IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO CENTS

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.352
AVERAGE RATING TVA WAS NINE

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:39.921
CENTS.

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:40.955
NOW.

01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:43.524
ED DIFFERENT THE SOCIAL

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:45.459
CONDITIONS AT ALL KINDS OF

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:47.828
DIFFERENCES -- BUT PART OF THAT

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.263
HAS TO DO WITH THE POLICY HERE.

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:50.932
BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER PART OF

01:32:50.998 --> 01:32:52.199
THE POLICY GOING FORWARD AS IF

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:53.501
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE PLANET

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:54.368
THEN YOU HAVE TO DO SOME OF

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:56.270
THESE THINGS TO GO MORE LOCAL

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:57.905
MORE DECENTRALIZED.

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:01.108
I THINK THAT'S WHERE WILL BE AND

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:04.979
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS.

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:07.715
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I'D.

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:09.283
WANT TO CONTINUE IT WITH YOU AND

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.584
I THAT YOUR OTHER

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.920
REPRESENTATIVES -- I THINK WE'VE

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.322
GOT SOME REAL CHALLENGES LOOKING

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:15.790
AT WHAT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:17.458
GRAY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND I

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:18.092
THINK WE'RE KINDA HELTER SKELTER

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:18.826
RING IT.

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:19.727
AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:21.162
FOCUSED ON A LONG TERM AS MUCH

01:33:21.228 --> 01:33:22.830
AS WE GET FOCUSED.

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:24.265
ON THE FACT THAT.

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:25.633
YOU'RE IN SURVIVAL MODE BUT I

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.968
APPRECIATE AT LEAST THE

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.402

HEADLINE PGA ANY CALLS CAMPFIRE.

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:49.190
CAL FIRE SAYS.

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:50.858
JUST CAME OUT TODAY PACIFIC GAS

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.893
ELECTRIC COMPANY IS BEING BLAMED

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.161
FOR SPARKING THE DEADLIEST AND

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:55.896
MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE.

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.331
IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.700
A NEW HEADLINE.

01:33:59.767 --> 01:34:03.637
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COST OF

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:04.238
SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED I

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:04.805
KNOW THE QUESTION WAS ASKED

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:05.873
ABOUT.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:06.474
ULTIMATELY WHERE DOES IT COME

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.876
FROM.

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:10.945
BUT THE THE ANSWER THE RESPONSE

01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:12.480
WAS CORRECT IT'S GOING TO

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:13.080
ULTIMATELY COME FROM THE RATE

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:19.153
PAYERS BUT MY QUESTION IS.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:24.759
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE THE

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:27.828
COST SHOULD BE BORN.

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:30.798
NOT ONLY BY THE RATE PAYERS.

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:34.268
BUT ALSO BY THE SHAREHOLDERS.

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:41.275
OF PGA ANY -- THAT'S EXACTLY

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:44.045
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE BANKRUPT.

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.046
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WEAPON THE

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.747
BANKRUPTCY HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:49.717
PAID FOR BY WHOMEVER.

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.284
AND PART OF THAT WILL BE THE

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:52.019
SHAREHOLDERS.

01:34:52.086 --> 01:34:53.788
WE'RE TALKING PROSPECTIVELY --

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.290
RIGHT.

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:57.591
THE RETROACTIVELY YES THE

01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:58.859
BANKRUPTCY COURT IS LOOKING AT

01:34:58.926 --> 01:35:00.694
THE PICTURE AND THEY WILL FIGURE

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:01.962
OUT ALL OF THOSE COSTS AND

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.431
FIGURE OUT HOW IT SCHOOL WHO'S

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:05.099
GOING TO GET PAID WHAT AND WILL

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.901
HAVE THE PROBLEMS JUST AS OF MY

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.335
COLLEAGUES TALKED ABOUT.

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:09.937
BUT PROSPECTIVELY.

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:12.473
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.107
TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.676
IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON THESE

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:16.944
ITEMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.846
INSPECTION REPAIR.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.281
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:22.349
AND THE COMMENT WAS MADE THAT

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.251
WHO WILL PAY.

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.654
WILL YOU MENTION FOR THE P.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.622
JEANNIE COFFERS BUT IN THE JUST

01:35:28.689 --> 01:35:29.723
THE RATE PAYERS.

01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:32.526
MY QUESTION IS PROSPECT OF BILLY.

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:35.396
WE'RE LOOKING AT SIX HUNDRED TO

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.030
NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IT

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:38.132
WILL BE SPENT. TO RIGHT THE

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:42.837
WRONGS THAT LET THE PRIOR RUNS.

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.738
SHOULD IT ALL BE FROM THE RATE

01:35:44.805 --> 01:35:46.674
PAYERS.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:49.076
POCKETS OR SHOULD THE

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.644
SHAREHOLDERS.

01:35:50.711 --> 01:35:54.682
ALSO PAY A PART OF THAT.

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:56.350
I THINK IF IS WRITING PREVIOUS

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.986
WRONGS SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD PAY

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.488
THEIR SHARE.

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:01.922
AND IN THE FUTURE.

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:04.625
WHEN THESE EXPENSES ARE MADE?

01:36:04.692 --> 01:36:05.960
AND IT ALL FALLS ON THE RATE

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:07.294
PAYERS.

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:08.362
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:09.930
SHAREHOLDERS.

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:13.234
SHOULD ALSO HAVE A SHARE.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.902
IN PAYING FOR THIS.

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:16.203

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.039

A GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING TO ME.

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:04.111
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO THEM?

01:38:04.178 --> 01:38:06.046
AND IT'S BEEN VERY SIMILAR TO

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:08.082
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME TODAY.

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:09.883
AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT I WOULD

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:11.552
HAVE.

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:14.021
THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH SPOKEN TO

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:17.191
BE BY THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH SO.

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:19.426
AND IF I HEAR OTHERWISE WE'LL

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:22.263
HAVE NEW PEOPLE WORKING THERE.

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:24.732

SOMETIME AVAILABLE FOR THE

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:47.021
PUBLIC.

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:48.322
TO TO ADDRESS THIS -- MINUTE.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.324
TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY NOW THERE

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:51.258
ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I THINK

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:51.692
THAT.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:53.327
ALL OF US CAN PROBABLY ENGAGE

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:55.329

THE FACT THAT YOU'VE FIELDED --

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.503
THE QUESTIONS TODAY -- THAT

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:03.137
DEALT WITH A VARIETY OF ISSUES

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.038
THAT.

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.939
ARE VERY MUCH ON THE FOREFRONT

01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:07.141
OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND P.

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:08.442
JEANNIE BUT JUST NOT.

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:11.478
PGA ANY BUT ALSO HOW WE GO

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.080
FORWARD TO STABILIZE THIS VERY

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.782
IMPORTANT INDUSTRY AND AND

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:17.885
CALIFORNIA -- AND BEFORE I TAKE.

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:20.020
PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK THAT WE

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:22.323
ARE ALL PROBABLY HEARING AND

01:39:22.389 --> 01:39:23.757
BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THAT --

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:26.894
THE CAMPFIRE RESPONSIBILITIES OF

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:29.396
OF THE INITIATION OF THE FIRE

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:32.232
DOES SEEM BASED ON OUR CAL FIRES

01:39:32.299 --> 01:39:40.274
ASSESSMENT -- TO FALL WITH P.

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:43.310
JEANNIE -- MY FEELING IS THAT

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:45.746
THE THAT THE THE P. GINNY AS

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:46.680
SORT OF AN TO SUBPOENA THIS --

01:39:46.747 --> 01:39:48.916
AND SO DOES REALLY CHANGE TOO

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:51.418
MUCH OF THE THE DYNAMIC SO THEN

01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:52.720
NOW IT'S REAL WOOD AND THEY'RE

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:54.088
LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT -- NEXT

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:54.521
STEPS.

01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:55.189
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO TAKE

01:39:55.255 --> 01:39:55.856
A SECOND.

01:39:55.923 --> 01:39:57.591
TO RESPOND YOU DON'T HAVE -- TO

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.294
BUT IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED.

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.495
TO MAKE A STATEMENT AS IT

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:03.864
RELATES TO THIS ARE CAL FIRE

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:05.399
DETERMINATION.

01:40:05.466 --> 01:40:07.067
ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY SO.

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:10.738
SO I HAVE MADE THE ASSUMPTION

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.172
WHEN I GOT HERE THAT.

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.140
P. GINNY EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THE

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:14.308
FIRE JUST MADE THE ASSUMPTION

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.944
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:18.245
START.

01:40:18.312 --> 01:40:20.647
THE COMPANY HAD SAID IN ITS

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:24.184
FILINGS RECENTLY IT WAS PROBABLE.

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:25.285
THAT THEIR EQUIPMENT CAUSED THE

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.720
FIRE SO.

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:32.926
THIS IS A IT'S NOT A

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:33.660
DISAPPOINTMENT.

01:40:33.727 --> 01:40:34.161
THAT.

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.462
IS A DIFFERENT DISAPPOINTED THAT

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:38.832
THIS HAPPENED -- LET'S NOT DO IT

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:42.970
AGAIN.

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.705
WE WILL NOW TAKE.

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:45.806

COMMENT WILL GIVE YOU -- TWO

01:40:49.243 --> 01:40:51.145
MINUTES IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:52.246
THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:53.447
ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AT THIS

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:58.352
TIME.

01:40:58.419 --> 01:41:00.454
ON THAT NOTE OKAY.

01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:02.289
IT'S STILL TWO MINUTES.

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:03.957
THANK YOU -- MICHAEL LOOK AT OR

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.559
ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY

01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:07.161
CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION I

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:09.163
APPRECIATE LIKE ALL OF YOU THE

01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:10.664
FACT THAT P. GINNY CEO.

01:41:10.731 --> 01:41:12.433
WAS HERE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:13.000
FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS SINCE

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.301
FIRST TIME I CAN REMEMBER THAT

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:15.536
FRANKLY SO.

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:16.737
THAT'S A GOOD THING AND WE'VE

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:18.105
HEARD A LOT ABOUT CARING AND

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:19.807
TRUST AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:21.275
KNOW ABOUT TRUST AS IT TAKES

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.576
YEARS TO BUILD.

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:24.144
SECONDS TO BREAK AND FOREVER TO

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.212
REPAIR.

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.947
UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:27.848
FOREVER.

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.416
AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT

01:41:29.483 --> 01:41:30.584
THE FIRST TIME P. GINNY HAS

01:41:30.651 --> 01:41:32.286
BROKEN THE TRUST IT'S NOT THE

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:33.554
SECOND TIME.

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.888
IT'S NOT THE THIRD TIME IT'S NOT

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.256
EVEN THE FOURTH TIME.

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:39.693
AND MY CONCERN IS IT WON'T BE

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.094
THE LAST TIME. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:42.930
I HEARD IT WAS VERY DISCOURAGING

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:45.466
TODAY WAS THAT P. GENIES FAILURE

01:41:45.532 --> 01:41:47.034
IN SAN BRUNO WAS FROM A LACK OF

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.669
KNOWLEDGE.

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.070
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I THINK

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.538
THEY KNEW THEIR SYSTEM WAS

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:53.841
PROBLEMATIC.

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:55.309
I THINK IT WAS A LACK OF

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:57.644
PRIORITY TO SPEND THE MONEY TO

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.646
FIX THAT SYSTEM AND THAT'S THE

01:41:59.713 --> 01:42:01.148
INHERENT PROBLEM THAT WE'RE

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.516
SEEING WITH PJ NAY.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:06.386
ITS PROFITS OVER SAFETY.

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:07.855
JUDGE ALSO I THINK HAS.

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:10.357
HONED IN ON THIS IS PART THE

01:42:10.424 --> 01:42:11.391
PROBATION DISCUSSION.

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:12.426
HE'S TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY'VE

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:14.461
PROVIDED FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:16.196
DOLLARS IN DIVIDENDS OF THE LAST

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:17.731
THREE YEARS THAT'S A LOT OF

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:18.332
MONEY.

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:20.334
THEY COULD HAVE GONE INTO SAFETY

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.502
THEY DIDN'T WANT AND A

01:42:21.568 --> 01:42:23.070
SHAREHOLDER PROFITS.

01:42:23.136 --> 01:42:24.171
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:26.173
I'M A FREE MARKET GUY REPRESENT

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.841
A LOT OF FREE MARKET COMPANIES.

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:28.842
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BALANCE

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.144
THERE AND THAT BALANCE IS

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:32.379
LACKING IN P. JEANNIE.

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:33.547
WERE ALREADY SEEING IT EVEN

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:35.582
MOVING FORWARD AND THIS GETS TO

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.216
THE QUESTIONS I THINK THAT MISS

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:38.852
RAMOS WAS WAS POSING AT THE AND

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:40.587
WE APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:43.156
AND THAT ISSUE SHAREHOLDERS NEED

01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:45.325
TO OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKES.

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:47.327
WE HEARD TODAY THAT P. GENIES.

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:48.862
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAMPFIRE

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.963
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR IN THE NEXT

01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:51.598
FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS WHETHER OR

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:52.733
NOT THEY WERE CRIMINALLY

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:55.202
NEGLIGENT AND ALL INDICATIONS

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.737
ARE THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL BE.

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:58.605
CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT BECAUSE

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.207
THEY KNEW THAT TRANSMISSION LINE

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:01.808
WAS PROBLEMATIC.

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:03.076
IN THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.945
THOSE TRANSMISSION LINES FOR NOT

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.780
ONE YEAR NOT TWO YEARS BUT MAY

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:10.517
BE AS MANY AS FOUR OR FIVE YEARS.

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:11.251
THAT'S ON THEM.

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:12.286
THAT CAN'T COME BACK TO RATE

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:13.987
PAYERS AND THAT'S THE FEAR THAT

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:15.455
WE A LOT OF US HAD WITH NINE A

01:43:15.522 --> 01:43:16.990
ONE LAST YEAR.

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.725
THAT HAS TO BE ON SHAREHOLDERS.

01:43:18.792 --> 01:43:20.294
KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL THE

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.729
BALL IN BANKRUPTCY RIGHT NOW P.

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:25.098
G.'S PREOCCUPIED WITH RE ISSUING

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.433
THEIR DIVIDENDS.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:28.035
THEY WANT TO START RE ISSUING

01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:29.403
PROFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS THE

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:30.170
CENTERS A. EMERGE FROM

01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:31.538
BANKRUPTCY THERE'S GOING TO BE A

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:33.707
PUSH TO RE ISSUE THAT DIVIDEND.

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:35.943
THOSE DIVIDEND SHOULD GO TO PAY

01:43:36.009 --> 01:43:38.412
FOR ANY RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:40.047
FROM ALL OF THESE FIRES.

01:43:40.113 --> 01:43:42.916
BEFORE RATE PAYERS ARE ASKED TO

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.585
PAY NOT AFTER.

01:43:44.651 --> 01:43:46.053
SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT AND

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:46.920
NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.422
TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE HEARINGS

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.457
THAT COME AFTER THIS TODAY FROM

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:52.092
THE RATE PAYER CRYPSIS FOCUS ON

01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:53.460
THAT DIVIDEND.

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:54.795
BECAUSE THAT'S MONEY IF YOU CAN

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:56.163
GO TO SHAREHOLDERS.

01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:57.731
IT CAN GO TO PAY BACK THE DAMAGE

01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:01.001
THEY'VE DONE OVER TIME AND THAT

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:01.368
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:03.437
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:44:03.503 --> 01:44:05.405
