MADAM PRO TEN ARE YOU PREPARED IBM THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. SO COLLEAGUES FOLLOWING THE INSPIRATIONAL PRAYER THIS MORNING. AND IN THE SPIRIT OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO WISH JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THERE ARE FEW IF ANY WOMEN ALIVE TODAY WHO HAVE LEFT MORE OF A MARK ON AMERICAN HISTORY. ARE DONE MORE FOR WOMEN'S EQUALITY TORY IS RBG. AND IT IS ONLY THROUGH HER SHEER DETERMINATION OF FORCE OF WILL THAT WE EVEN KNOW HER NAME TODAY. BECAUSE DESPITE HER REMARKABLE INTELLECT HER MORAL CLARITY AND HER RELENTLESS WORK ETHIC SHE WAS DISMISSED AND IGNORED AND BE LITTLE AT VIRTUALLY EVERY STEP OF HER CAREER. BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN. IS A WOMAN. WHEN SHE ENROLLED AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX SHE WAS ONE OF JUST NINE WOMEN IN HER CLASS OF FIVE HUNDRED SHE WAS RIDICULED FOR EVEN HAVING THE NERVE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A MAN? SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO SERVE ON THE HARVARD LAW REVIEW ALL WHILE CARING FOR HER TWO YEAR OLD CHILD. AND HER HUSBAND WHO HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TESTICULAR CANCER. AND WHEN SHE ULTIMATELY GRADUATED AT THE TOP OF HER CLASS FROM COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE SHE COULDN'T EVEN GET AN INTERVIEW AT A REPUTABLE LAW FIRM. BECAUSE SHE WAS A WOMAN. AS A LAW PROFESSOR SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO EARN FULL TENURE AT COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL. AS A TRIAL LAWYER AND DIRECTOR OF THE GROUND BREAKING WOMEN'S RIGHTS PROJECT FOR THE ACLU SHE SUCCESSFULLY ARGUED SIX CASES ON GENDER DISCRIMINATION BEFORE THE US SUPREME COURT. IN FACT IRONICALLY ENOUGH SHE CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF GENDER DISCRIMINATION LAW IN AMERICA BY ARGUING ON BEHALF OF MEN WHO HAD BEEN DENIED GOVERNMENT BENEFITS WHETHER IT WAS SPOUSAL ALLOWANCE FOR THE HUSBAND OF A FEMALE OFFICER. IN THE AIRFORCE OUR PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR WIDOWERS. OF COURSE SHE WENT ON TO BECOME THE SECOND WOMAN EVER TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. AND NOW DESPITE HER DIMINUTIVE STATURE. EYES SHE IS TOWERING BY A TOWERING FIGURE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO IMAGINE JUST HOW DIFFERENT OUR WORLD WOULD BE WITHOUT HER TODAY. SO IN RECOGNITION OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH SO THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE AWARE IT IS ALL MONTH. ARE WE WANNA WISHER I WANT TO TAKE A PRIVILEGE TO WISH.

AND IT AND THIS WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR JOURNEY MEMORIES [inaudible] SENATOR SKINNER. COLLEAGUES I ASK THAT YOU JOIN. ME IN A DURING IN MEMORY. A VICTOR MACKEL HANEY. A PROUD OAKLAND NATIVE A TALENTED DRUMMER. A GUN CONTROL ACTIVIST AND A STUDENT AT USC. WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN? TWENTY TWO NEXT MONTH THIS APRIL. VICTOR WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED. IN APPARENT ROBBERY ATTEMPT. NEAR HIS SCHOOL USC HE WAS IN THE PARKING LOT OF A MARKET WITH SOME FRIENDS. HE WAS THE SON. OF MY FRIEND OAKLAND COUNCIL MEMBER LYNETTE MACKEL HANEY. AND CLEARANCE MEDICAL HANEY. HE STUDIED JAZZ. AT THE OAKLAND PUBLIC CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC. THEN HE WENT TO CAL STATE EAST BAY AND TRANSFERRED TO USC TO CONTINUE HIS MUSIC STUDIES. HE VICTOR WAS VERY DELIBERATE. IN CONNECTING HIS STUDY OF JAZZ MUSIC TO ITS ORIGINS BY FRICAN AMERICANS IN OUR AMERICAN SOUTH. HE GREW UP SURROUNDED BY A COMMUNITY OF ACTIVISTS BUT HE WAS FINDING HIS STRIDE AS AN INDEPENDENT ACTIVIST IN HIS OWN RIGHT. HE WAS AN INDEPENDENT SOUL. MINETTE DESCRIBED TO ME THAT HE WAS THE ONLY BABY THAT SHE'D EVER MET THAT CRIED WHEN SHE HELD HIM TOO LONG. BECAUSE HE WANTED HIS OWN SPACE AND I'M SORRY FOR BREAKING UP BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE LOSING MY BABY. A FELLOW STUDENT REMEMBERED HIM AS OUT SPOKEN ANY PERSON WHO CHALLENGED EVERYONE AROUND HIM IN A WAY. THAT WOULD ADVANCE. OUR CULTURE AND THE CULTURE THAT WAS SO DEAR TO HIM. HE WAS ROOTED IN HIS MUSIC IN HIS COMMUNITY AND IN HIS FAITH. HE MENTORED TEENS BOTH WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND WHILE HE'S FIRST STARTED COLLEGE IN THE EAST IN THE EAST BAY AREA STILL IN OAKLAND THREE MENTOR TEENS AT THE OAKLAND PUBLIC CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC. AND WHEN HE WENT TO USC HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE CENTER FOR BLACK CULTURAL AND STUDENT AFFAIRS. DID I MENTION THAT HE WAS. KILLED JUST LAST SATURDAY NIGHT HIS MOTHER. COUNCILMEMBER MACKEL HANEY. ESTABLISHED OAKLAND'S DEPARTMENT OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION. AFTER HER ADOPTED GRAN CENTURION HUGHES WAS ALSO. DIED FROM GUN VIOLENCE IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND LYNETTE WAS ATTENDING. THE TRIAL FOR THAT SHOOTER IN THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS SO SHE WAS AT THAT TRIAL JUST LAST WEEK. HERE'S WHAT LYNETTE VICTOR'S MOTHER EXPRESSED IN A PRESS EVENT. WHEN SHE IN CLEARANCE VICTOR'S FATHER WERE APPEALING? TWO POLICE HAVE. THOSE WHO SHOT HIM OR INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT TO COME FORWARD OR FOR ANYONE WHO KNEW ABOUT IT TO COME FORWARD. THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID. VICTOR WAS ALWAYS EXPANDING HER BORDERS. HE IS NOT JUST A HOMICIDE NUMBER. HE CAME INTO THE WORLD A DRUMMER. HE COULD DRUM BEFORE EVEN COULD SET UP. HE BELIEVED MUSIC COULD HEAL THE WORLD FROM VIOLENCE SICKNESS AND ADDICTION. AND HIS DESIRE TO BRING WHAT HE CALLED MUSIC MEDICINE. IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO UCLA TO STUDY MUSIC OR USC POLICIES. WHEN IT STATED VERY CLEARLY? THAT STATISTICS SHOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN BOYS. IN THE AGE OF TEENAGERS TO YOUNG ADULTS. ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM GUN VIOLENCE THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS AND IN OAKLAND ALONE. THAT IS A 63% HIGHER LIKELIHOOD. BUT SHE ALSO STATED VERY CLEARLY IT'S AN EPIDEMIC. THAT WE THAT AMERICA CAN CURE. AND SHE CHALLENGED US TO DO SO AND HER MESSAGE IS TO DO WHAT VICTOR. TOLD HER. AND TOLD THE STUDENTS THAT HE MENTORED HE SAID CHANGE THE VIBRATION. SEND LOVE OUT AS A HEALING ENERGY. USE MUSIC TO HEAL. AND SEND THAT HEALING ENERGY FROM OAKLAND TO THE WORLD. LET VICTOR BE THE REASON WE NO LONGER HAVE TO ROB OR STEAL OR TAKE A LIFE. WE ALL WANT OUR NATION AND OUR CITIES TO HEAL. AND FOR THAT. COUNCILMEMBER MACKEL HANEY HER FAMILY HER CHURCH AND MANY OTHERS. WHO ARE WORKING WITH HER WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AND USE VICTOR AS THEIR GUIDE? AND I HOPE WE ALL DO. AND THEY HAVE SET UP A MEMORIAL FUND IN HIS HONOR TO HELP FUNDS THAT WORK. THAT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY BOSS WHICH IS IN EAST BAY NONPROFIT DEDICATED. TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS MASS INCORPORATE INCARCERATION AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE. I THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME IN. HIS A DURING THE SESSION IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER FOR THAT MOVING TRIBUTE AND CONDOLENCES FROM THE SENATE TO THE MEDICAL HANEY FAMILY -- SENATOR [inaudible] MITCHELL. ARE YOU -- WEIGHING IN ON THIS JOURNEY MEMORY OKAY. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT HI AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE. FROM THE EAST BAY -- FOR THAT POWERFUL RECOUNT. I THINK THE BANNER HEADLINE -- FROM THE COUNCIL WOMAN IN THE LA TIMES SUMS IT UP FOR EVERYBODY AND SHE SAID. PERMISSION TO RE. PLEASE THANK YOU AND I QUOTE. I MISS MY BABY. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ON SPRING BREAK. AND HOW MANY OF US REMEMBER SPRING BREAK. AT TWENTY ONE NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD. AND SO WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AS WE DURING HIS MEMBER THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE. THE RIPPLE EFFECT GUN VIOLENCE CREATES AND THE SENSE OF TRAUMA. THAT THE BROADER COMMUNITY IS GONNA REFER EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT. OF THIS YOUNG MAN LOSING HIS LIFE. HE WAS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF BLACK STUDENTS. AT U. S. SEES. FULL OF MUSIC THE THORTON SCHOOL OF MUSIC. HE WAS IN JAZZ STUDIES SO HE WAS IN THE CONTEMPORARY DIVISION ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF BLACK STUDENTS. THE DEAN HAS SPOKEN THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN PROFESSORS IN THE SCHOOL OF MUSIC. HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE TRAUMA THE ENTIRE SCHOOL IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THIS ACT OF VIOLENCE. AND SO AS WE ADJOURN IN HIS MEMORY AND HOLD OUR DEAR FRIEND THE COUNCIL WOMAN UP. TO GIVE HER THE STRENGTH TO THE NEED AS A MOTHER TO GO FORWARD AS A PUBLIC SERVANT. AND SERVE HER COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO BE MINDFUL OF THE IMPACT TRAUMA REALLY HOUSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THOSE STUDENTS THE BLACK STUDENTS ALL THE STUDENTS ON THAT CAMPUS WILL FOR EVER BE IMPACTED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD CLASSMATE. ANSEL SOMETIMES OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND VIOLENCE WHOSE COMMUNITY YOUR COMMUNITY NOT MY COMMUNITY WHAT THE GUNS ARE GOOD OR BAD GETS LOST IN THE SHEER TRAUMA. OF A LOST THE LIFE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE HANGING OUT ON SPRING BREAK. LIKE ALL OF US HAD THE FREEDOM AND LUXURY TO DO. SOME MORE FREE TO DO SO THAN OTHERS. SO WHY TO RISE. TO LIFT UP THE MEMORY OF THIS BRIGHT YOUNG STAR A FUTURE [inaudible] LEADER. SOMEONE WHO HAD THE CREATIVITY AND FOR THOUGHT. TWO ONE A COMBINED BLACK STUDIES IN JAZZ STUDIES THE HELP TOUCH A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE. AND I RISE IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR MITCHELL.
