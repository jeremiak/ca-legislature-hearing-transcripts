HELLO COMMITTEE CHAIR STOPPING ABOUT EYE AND JACK BUILT RESIDUE OF GO OR INTO YOUR COMP MEMBER HE GOT THE TO AND DOES COME BY THE BROWN ACTIVE LEARN TO MEETINGS REMOTELY BUT MANY WILL RESORT BACK TO THEIR OLD WAYS THAT IS WHY WE NEED CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE AB THREE THREE NINETY CONTINUE PUSHES OFF BOARD AB THREE THREE NINE WILL ENSURE CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING PROCESS BY EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES TO JOIN PUBLIC MEETINGS. THEY MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA TELEPHONE INTERNET BASED SERVICE OPTIONS SO DURING AND BEYOND THAT WE NINETEENTH ENDEMIC MEDIAN PASSER BY TO UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE TO BETTER PARTICIPATION LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEETING SO IN NINETEEN A CLOSER WE CAN PRINT OUT MEDIAN VIRTUALLY AND I WATCHED MY OWN CITY COUNCIL. STRUGGLE TO FIND A WAY TO ADOPT. AND OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE- OF OUR BASED PARTICIPATION BIG ACROSS. OUR CITY HALL. WE FINALLY HAD PROBLEM REGARDING MY OUT. FOR EVERY POSITION WE HAD IN OUR COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEE. WE CAN'T CRAWL BCK INTO THE DARK IN A WAY FOR BEING TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC. BY RETURNING BACK TO THE VERY PRESENT EXISTED BEFORE WE ARE DOING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND I MEAN. THAT MEANS WE NEED TO DO IT ON THEIR TIME WHETHER COMMUTING HOME COOKING DINNER FOR FAMILY PUTTING HIM DOWN OF THAT STUDY FOR YOUR MID TERMS WORKING. OR ENJOYING OUR BACK CALIFORNIA RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES. SECURITY COUNCIL ON APRIL NINETEENTH APPROVED THE CONTRACT YOU UPGRADE OUR AUDIO VISUAL EQUIPMENT. IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS I AM PROUD TO. WITH THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN TO INCLUDE A HYBRID MODEL. THAT ALLOWS ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE. ALTHOUGH GO RATED IT MANDATED FOLLOW THE BILL EVEN A SMALL STUDIO FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND HAD THE COMMITMENT ABOUT THE NEED TO FOLLOW THE PROVISIONS. I DON'T SEE WHY LARGER CITY COUNCIL. AND BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEETING CAN'T DO THE SAME AB THREE THREE NINE WOULD ESTABLISH STANDARDS PROPOSED IN BOTH. AGENDAS IN DIRECTION. I JOIN THE MEETING VIA TELECONFERENCE CONFERENCE TECHNOLOGY IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND I EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATION ONLINE. LAST WEEK VERY CLEAR STANDARDS THAT ENSURE THE EQUITABLE PROVISION OF ACCESS. TO PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE A GOVERNMENT THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO HIS CONSTITUENTS. OUR DEMOCRACY CANNOT FUNCTION- LET. EVERYONE IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE EQUALLY THANK YOU ANY CONCLUSION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBM. CUSTOMER THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR LEADERSHIP GREAT TO HEAR ABOUT GILROY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY OUR FINAL. MAIN WITNESS IN SUPPORT IS GONNA BE MISTER SNYDER FROM THE FIRST AND THEN MAKE A COALITION. MISTER SNYDER WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE GINNI THE ROW- INSTEAD OF MISTER SNYDER BUT LET'S CHECK INTO ENGINEER DAVID. ON THE LINE FROM THE PERSON IN THE COALITION.

ONE ON ONE LEGAL COUNSLING LITIGATION AND MORE ARE ON THE DURING AND WITHOUT IN DISTRICT TWO. AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THREE THREE NINE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HELP OF ANY DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT DEMOCRACY TO OBSERVE. AND INTERACT SELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS. THEY HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THIS MEANS BEING ABLE TO SEE AND HEAR. AND IMPORTANTLY TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC MEETINGS IN REAL TIME. BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS YOU MEAN HAVING TO ARRANGE CHILDCARE. OR TAKE TIME OFF WORK. GETTING A RIDER PAYING FOR TRANSIT TRAVELING LONGER DISTANCES WITHIN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE WORSE. BEING ABLE THOSE. UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO HEALTH CONCERNS OR DISABILITIES. THAT THE BURDEN SO HIGH THAT IT MADE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OUT OF REACH. FOR MANY. AND IT LEFT GOVERNMENT THREE TO MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S ONE SILVER LINING FROM THE PANDEMIC THAT ACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING. BECAME AVAILABLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF PEOPLE THAN IT WAS BEFORE. EIGHTY THREE THREE NINE WOULD ENSURE THESE. GAMES ARE NOT LOST. AB ONE BOARD SUPERVISORS MEETING IN. OF POPULAR OVER. ABOUT IT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE CONSTITUENTS WILL EITHER A AND- INTERNET BASED OPTIONS FOR PARTICIPATION. FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF AGENCIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE. BACK THAT. LOCAL DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA DEPENDS ON TRANSPARENCY FOR ITS HELP. WITH LIABILITY THE BILITY SERVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT COALITION URGES THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT LEVEL OF ACCESS. IS MAINTAINED AS PROVIDED FOR IN EIGHTY THREE THREE NINE BEYOND TE PANDA. THANK YOU.

OF AB THREE THREE NINE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TO MINISTER. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AS YOU SAID JEFF BEAL WITH CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES- BECAUSE OUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF AS- HAS CHANGED THE CONVERSATION. AROUND THE BROWN ACT IN A NUMBER OF THOUGHT PROVOKING WAYS. AS THE SUPPORTERS NOTED WE FOUND OUT THAT. IN MANY CASES AND UNDER CERTAIN SETS OF RULES REMOTE MEETINGS WORK- UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY THREE THREE NINE. IT DOESN'T IMPLEMENT THE RULES THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING UNDER INDEPENDENT JUST ONE. SPECIFIC. REQUIREMENT OF IT. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT RETAINING THE WAY PROBE. PURCHASE BUT NOT THE PIECES BE EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAVE ALLOWED MORE FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING PUBLIC COMMENT WE'LL SEE MORE. LOCAL AGENCY MEETINGS OF THE DEFECTIVE ONES ANYWAY TOO OFTEN DISTRACTED BY THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ACTING OVER THE PAST YEAR. EXAMPLES BEING- HUNDREDS OF CALLERS CALLING IN FROM OUT OF STATE ON HOT BUTTON ISSUES SUCH AS PUBLIC REQUIREMENTS. OR ANOTHER EXAMPLE FROM JUST LAST WEEK AT THE MEETING THE HEAD SEVEN HUNDRED CALLERS ON THE SINGLEISSUE. UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE DISRUPTIONS AND MANAGE OVERWHELMING NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS FIVE. FOR EXAMPLE LIMITING THE TOTAL TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN A WAY THAT YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR TO EVERYONE SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S A SOLUTION THAT. HONORS THAT DIVERSITY OF VOICES. WHY ASO ALLOW GETS TO A- BE NAY ON THE MATTER SUPPORT IMPORTANCE- BUT FLEXIBILITY AREN'T IN THIS BILL. I WILL SAY WE'VE HAD EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND I WHEN I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE AND HIS STAFF. FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS AND- WE JUST HAD MORE TIME TO WORK TOGETHER I FEEL HOPEFUL THAT WE BE ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON HOW TO. OPEN THE BROWN ACT OF THE MODERN ERA. OF COURSE ONE WILL THAT CHANGE YOUR INDEPENDENT BECAUSE THAT ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY WITHOUT PUBLISHING THEIR ADDRESS ARE OPENING THEIR HOMES TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WHICH SHOULD TO WORK OKAY. I SUSPECT WAS ONE. REASON WHY GILROY WAS FINALLY ABLE TO FILL ALL THE SPOTS ON THE BOARDS AND COMMISSION BECAUSE- THOSE APPOINTED OFFICIALS COULD PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. I'M MORE TIME WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO STUDY. WHAT DIFFERENT PUBLIC AGENCIES DID OVER THE PERIOD A LOCKDOWN WHAT WORKED WHAT DIDN'T SIMILAR TO THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT. WAS JUST RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO- HOPEFUL TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE AND YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM WE MUST WORK QUICKLY OPPOSED.

THERE'S NOBODY ELSE QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME MISTER CARE RAMOS MATTER WE'LL TALK TO YOU IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS THIS RING BACK TO COMMITTEE TO HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR SOMEONE LIKE TO BRING FOR THE MOTION WE HAVE QUESTIONS BY SIR WIENER PLEASE. OUR SYSTEM REMOVE THE BILL- ANTICYCLONES FIRST OF ALL- AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL- I DO AGREE WITH- WITH C. SACK THAT WE'RE LONG PAST TO TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT THE BROWN ACT AND HOW IT CAN BE MODERNIZED ON HAVING SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS- ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SAN FRANCISCO SUBJECT THE PRODUCT ARE MANY GOOD THINGS IN THE BROWN ACT BUT BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY WRITTEN. IN A DIFFERENT ERA AND I THINK OUR- REPRESENTATIVES HE SACKED- REYES SOME EXAMPLES OF WAYS WHERE THE PRODUCT IS JUST WAY OUT OF DATE AND WE MAKE A VERY VERY HARD AT TIMES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY OPERATE EFFECTIVELY IN A COMMON SENSE WAY- AND THAT'S AGAIN THE THOUGHT HE KNEW HERE THERE FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY VALID POINT- TO RAISE. I WILL SAY- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH PUBLIC COMMENT- AND THE CONCERN I THINK HE MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE CALL THEN YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNLIKE. THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT. THE LIMITS ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE SOME. VALVES SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO THAT BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY OF. APPARENTLY ENTIRE PROCESS IS BEING COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED- WHEN I WAS ON THE VERGE SUPERVISORS WE HAD SOME WE HAD NO TELEPHONIC COURSE WE HAD THERE WERE HEARINGS OR WE HAD EIGHT HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT WHERE PEOPLE JUST. CAME DOWN THE OLD FASHION WAY AND IT TOOK SIX SEVEN EIGHT HOURS OR EVEN MORE- SO EVEN WITH LIVE TESTIMONY YOU CAN REALLY HAVE AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF. A PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT I WHEN WE WENT TO TELEPHONIC TESTIMONY HERE NUMBER THING OH BOY STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE PLUS PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY- YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIKE INTERNET. CALL IN TESTIMONY IN WHAT IS THAT GOING TO BE LIKE. AND I AS A COMMITTEE MEMBER AND ALSO AS A CHAIR. THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW TIMES HEN WE REALLY HAVE A LIMIT- THE TIME OR THE TIMING- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PRETTY RARE THAT WE TIED. YOU KNOW A REALLY OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE SO I THINK THE- ESPECIALLY THIS IS- JUST FOR US TO BE SO EXTENDING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS- YOU KNOW AS WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND PEOPLE USED TO IT AND- YOU KNOW I. I THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE AND THEN WE CAN REEVALUATE. AND AGAIN I HOPE WE WILL TAKE A BROADER LOOK BUT I'M NOT GOING TO MOVE THE BALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER SENATOR VERY GRATEFUL BUT I COULD DO A FINAL CALL FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE WHICH MOTION ON THE FLOOR PERSON WIENER MOTION FOR BY SIR WIENER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS HERE AND SEE NINE SOME RELIEF THE PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COLLABORATION. GREAT BELL- AND WE'LL LET YOU CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE SENT TO THE CHAIR FOR A DUE DILIGENCE AND- ATTENTION TO THIS BILL. I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE OPPOSITION ITS EXACT AS A VERY VALID POINT I THINK THERE IS A WAY THAT CAN MODERNIZE THE BROWN ACT PAUL. HAVING MORE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WILL OFFICIAL SITE I THINK THEY'RE VALID POINTS THAT IS MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND ALL. REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO BE WORKING ON THE EXTENT. BUT YOU KNOW AS WE DID SEE IT RIGHT NOW IS OVERLYING EVAN THAT MAKE IS THAT WE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY TO OPEN THE DOORS OF DEMOCRACY EVEN IF IT MIGHT NOT BE LITERALLY DOING SO. AND HAVING THAT PARTICIPATION I THINK IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING BECAUSE- I AM SURE WE OFTEN HEARD HOW WE LACK PARTICIPATION LONG TIMES BUT NOW WE KIND OF SEPARATE THEM OPPOSITE PROBLEM. SO IF WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE FRUSTRATION FOR TAWDRY IT'S ALWAYS GOOD AND YOU HAVE MY- AND IT'LL PROMISE I'LL BE BACK FOR THIS COMMITTEE WORKING ON A SIMILAR ISSUE AGAIN VERY VERY SOON SO.

ARE WE ARE COLLECTIVELY IN STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS CHANGE IN STATUTE TO ENSURE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO THE OFFICE OF OUNTY SUPERVISOR. A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE OFFICE. AND THE CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT THEY CALIFORNIANS CAN BE CONFIDENT IN. MY COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN CALIFORNIA AND LIKE IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL SERVICES. THIS IS BECOME MOST EVIDENT OVER THE LAST YEAR IS COUNTY SERVED AS THE FRONT LINE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND CERTAINLY UNDERSCORES THE NEED. FOR TIME FOR SUPERVISORS TO GAIN ACCESS EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING A COMPLEX A COMPLEX THAT. OF SERVICE OBLIGATIONS OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. A SINGLE TERM SIMPLY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH EXPERTISE. AND AS A RESULT OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT A SINGLE TERM LIMIT WOULD MEAN. FOR COUNTY POLICYMAKING. AND SERVICE PROVISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IF YOU KNOW COUNTY SUPER. TAKE THEIR RESPONSE SERIOUSLY AND ALL WITH NON THAT REQUIRED TO DEVELOP EXPERTISE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE WIDE ARRAY OF DUTIES OF THE ROLE.

WELL AWARE IF YOU'RE YOU'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE- DEBATE ABOUT TERM LIMITS THAT WE- MOSTLY OPPOSE THEM AT THE STATE LEVEL. OFTEN SUPPORTED THEM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- IN EACH INSTANCE TRYING TO STRIKE THE BALANCE BETWEEN. EXPERTISE AND BRINGING NEW BLOOD AND NEW IDEAS TO. GOVERNMENT BUT IN NONE OF THOSE INSTEAD IS HIS HAVE WE SUPPORT A SINGLE TERM LIMIT. THAT SEEMS TO TILT THE BALANCE AWAY FROM. KAPATID EX EXPERTISE SAID AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL- FOR THAT REASON WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- I WOULD ALSO SAY THIS. ARGUMENT THAT THEY'RE SOMEHOW SOMETHING IN THIS BILL THAT OVERTURNS WHAT HAPPENED AT SAMPOERNA DINO I THINK THE ANALYSIS VERY. ADROITLY POINTS OUT THAT- BE LOCAL CHARTER FILL PROCEED TO EVERYTHING THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS CENTER SAMPOERNA DINO WOULD BE A SUBSEQUENT VOTE OF THE PEOPLE AND THAT CHARTER CHANGE OR- A SUCCESSFUL LEGAL CHALLENGE AND NONE OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. FOR THAT REASON WE ARE TRANSPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BRANDON ALL RIGHT TO LAZING GENTLEMEN YOU HAVE HEARD FROM MISS HEARST EVERDEEN RC RC IN URBAN COUNTIES YOU HEARD FROM MR BRENNAN REPRESENTING S.

FOUR TO EIGHT MISTER MURPHY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANKS FOR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. BUT ONE SIMPLE QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED TODAY. IS AB FOUR TWENTY EIGHT GOOD GOVERNANCE. THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO. FOR TWO REASONS FIRST IT MEAN FOR TWENTY YEARS PLACES RESTRICTIONS ON THE KOREAN FULL EXERCISE OF THE PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO INITIATIVE. EARLY VOTERS A THREE TO SET TERM LIMITS THAT THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE. APPROVAL OF EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY EIGHT WILL LIMIT THAT FREEDOM WITH NO REASONABLE JUSTIFICATION. BASIC JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS RESTRICTION OF RIGHTS THAT IT TAKES A VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME TO LEARN AND BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE JOB. EVEN A RESERVE ACCURATE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T CONCEDE THAT POINT. THIS IS STILL INSUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION THE BOYS A RESTRICTION OF A CITIZEN'S RIGHT TO INITIATIVE. IN REALITY IS POLITICAL INTENT OF THE BILLS TO TORPEDO SAMBAR DINO CARRIES MAJOR K. BUT SHOPPERS BEEN FIRED BY THE COUNTY'S POLITICAL ONLY THAT THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS. THEY PROPOSED TO INCLUDE YOUR. WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES AND SELF INTEREST LEGISLATION ON BEHALF OF POLITICAL CRONIES. FOR TWENTY EIGHT THE LINE TO SUPPORT SOME BIRD THE CLERK SAYS WILL THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTERS AND A SINGLE COUNT. DO SO BY IMPOSING UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS HOWEVER I CAN CITIZENS FIFTY SEVEN OTHER TOWNS KNOWN THROUGH THE ONLY APPROPRIATE AND PROPER VOTE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TO REPEAT THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR VOICE IN OPPOSITION WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO SCOTT KAUFMAN SCOTT COMPANIES REPRESENT HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION ALL RIGHT SIR YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE THIS WILL BE OUR THIRD AND FINAL LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS WITH EQUAL TIME BETWEEN OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT. MISTER KAUFMAN WELCOME SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL CONTINUE TO CLAIM IT HAS NOTHING TO IT MEASURE K. WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON MEASURE K. THEY EVEN DID SO HERE TODAY THE COMPANY ANALYSIS. THAT WOULD MENTION THOUGH HAS IT HAS A DIFFERENT THEORY HOW I'LL QUOTE THAT NOW FOR YOU. QUOTE BECAUSE VOTERS IN ST BERNARD DINO HAVE ADOPTED TERM LIMITS AS AUTHORIZED UNDER CURRENT LAW A FEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF TERMS THAT WOULD. BE REQUIRED BY AB FOUR TO EIGHT IT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A CANDIDATE FOR SUPERVISOR YOU CHALLENGED AND POTENTIALLY OVERTURN MEASURE K. IN COURT ON THE BASIS THAT IT WAS PRINTED BY STATE LAW DUE TO THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE SINGLE TERM LIMIT MEASURE K. AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT. TERM LIMITS BEFORE AT LEAST TWO TERMS ON THE OTHER HAND IT BECAUSE OF THAT HE WAS PRIVATIZED INSURANCE MAY BE LIMITED. LIMIT AB PROPOSED IT COULD BE ARGUED THAT AB FOUR TO EIGHT ONLY REVISES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR FUTURE PROPOSALS. FOR TERM LIMITS. AS WRITTEN AB FOUR TO EIGHT LEAVES TO THE CORE. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER MEASURE K. WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE. THE INTENT IS CLEAR. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL BELIEVE MEASURE K. IS A PROBLEM. THE REAL PROBLEM IS STRIPPING VOTERS STATE WIDE OF THE ABILITY TO DESIGNATE THEIR PREFERRED LENGTH OF TERM. AND SAID HEY OF THE COUNTY SUPERVISORS BECAUSE WE DISLIKE THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION. AND WE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO THANK YOU. NOTHING THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY THAT IS IN GERMAN WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW IS WE'RE GOING TO SEE.

ASIANS HAVE BEEN CRAFTED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WITH INPUT FROM LOCAL AGENCIES BASED ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS THE INPUT OF OTHER GOOD GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDERS. EIGHTY THREE SIXTY ONE OF NOT JUST ABOUT THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BUT ABOUT A MEETING THE NEXT EMERGENCY SHOULD THERE BE ANOTHER FUTURE EMERGENCY WHICH MAKES UNSAFE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MEET IN PERSON HELLO YOU CAN BE WILL BE EMPOWERED TO BE REMOTELY AND ENSURE THAT CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES CONTINUE. RATHER THAN RESORTING TO CANCEL. MEETINGS AND ROBIN SERVICES. YOU ALL YOUR TIME IF YOU. WITH RESPECT TO THE MEASURE AND I WILL ON THE LINE LISTENING PRESS QUESTION.

THANK YOU GOODAFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAITLIN GENE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR STAFF SPONSORS INDEED COMMITTEE FOR THE RECENT AMENDMENTS BEING MADE TO THE BILL TODAY. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CONCERN BUT NOT BEEN ADDRESSED AND THEREFORE WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE. SACRAMENTO WELL THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES DURING TIMES OF CRISIS OR EMERGENCY AFFORDABLE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST CONTINUE TO. ACTIVELY CONDUCT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS IN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. THE LEADING FUNDAMENTAL AND LONGSTANDING PUBLIC PROTECTION SHOULD BE% EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY CIRCUMSCRIBED. UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY THREE TO ONE GOES TO FAR BY EXEMPTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THE OBLIGATION AND THE BROWN ACT TO IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF EACH TELECONFERENCE OCCASION AS WELL AS THE REQUIREMENT THAT TELECONFERENCE LOCATIONS BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL AMENDED TO REQUIRE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY TO APPEAR ON VIDEO DURING PUBLIC MEETINGS WHENEVER TELECONFERENCING. AB THREE SIX ONE NO LONGER REQUIRES ELECTED OFFICIALS TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS IN FACT THE FIGHT THEIR CONTENT THAT. THE PUBLIC MUST BE ABLE TO VIEW THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. ON VIDEO. MORE THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO BE A TO PROVIDE COMMENT TO THEIR ELECT OFFICIALS AT THE- AS THAT WILL. IF THEIR LIFE ARE BEING. AS SUCH IT IS A- THAT BOTH THE INTERNET SERVICE IN. COPS ARE PROVIDED FOR THE PUBLIC TO ADDRESS THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY. THE CURRENT PANDEMIC HAS REMINDED US HOW SPECIAL A FUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT IS. ALL OF OUR WELL BEING. COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE RAISED THEIR VOICES TO FIGHT FOR MORE EQUITABLE BUDGET RELIEF PACKAGES. TO VOICE CONCERNS WITH RE OPENING PLANNED AND ADVOCATE FOR THEIR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. WE SHOULD BE EMBRACING THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS MADE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO STAY CONNECTED DURING THIS TIME. AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE IT BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. A WELL INFORMED AND ENGAGED COMMUNITIES IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING TRUST AND REBUILDING BETTER. THE PUBLIC ACCEPTABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BROWN ACT ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CANNOT ATTEND MEETINGS IN PERSON. AND CAN DIRECTLY ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF GOVERNING BODY.

WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS LAST CALL CONVERSATION. PLEASE SENATOR AZAM GOOD AFTERNOON YES THAT QUESTION THE AUTHOR PLEASE PRETTY. GOOD TO THEM- QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS MADE I THINK IT WAS BY ACLU. ON THERE ARE- PROPOSALS I THINK IF I UNDERSTOOD IT RIGHT TO. APPEAR ON VIDEO FOR THE OFFICIALS TO APPEAR ON VIDEO I THINK IT WAS. AND TO ALLOW PUBLIC COMMENT BY PHONE OR INTERNET DID I GET THAT RIGHT. SURE YEAH AND YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME- I CAN POSSIBLY. ON THOSE EXACT CONCERNS I KNOW WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THEM SINCE DAY ONE- YOU KNOW AND I THINK AS- THE CHAIR. PROPERLY MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF- THIS DISCUSSION. IS THE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BILL THAT WAS PRESENT EARLIER BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE. WHO ALSO HAS A IN A POINT ON THE SPACE TO INCREASE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PARTICIPATE REMOTELY ARE THOSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT THE EFFORT WE HAVE HERE IS VERY DIFFERENT- IN FACT I'M A CO AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEASE BILL BECAUSE I SUPPORT. THAT AS WELL SO IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THEY- YEAH- YOU KNOW THEY- HAVEN'T IN MY OPINION. WANTED TO SERIOUSLY ENGAGE WITH OUR BILL- THEY'RE VIEWED IT AS AN OP YEAH BUT A BILL THAT'S A COMPETITION WITH MISTER LEE'S BILL WHICH HIGH- I DISAGREE WITH. OTHER EXHAUSTION AND WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM AS WE HAVE FROM DAY ONE AND I THINK. YOU KNOW THE ONE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS A WE ARE DOING DID YOU KNOW AND OUR EFFORT IS WHAT THE POINT IS WE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER LAST YEAR AND A HALF OF. THE DISK AND THEN IT. IS THE IMPORTANT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE. PREPARED FOR THE NEXT EMERGENCY. I AND SO YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS I KNOW IT HAS A SUNSET OF TWO YEARS. BUT CERTAINLY AND IN THOSE NEXT TWO YEARS LOCAL AGENCIES WILL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEEN USED ALREADY AMID THIS PANDEMIC- BUT WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW US. AND ALLOW THESE LOCAL AGENCIES OCTOBER TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES ON IT YO UNCERTAIN TIMES- AND SO CERTAINLY THIS IS- AN EXTENSION OF WHAT WE HAVE HAD UNDER THIS EMERGENCY- WE JUST WANT TO INSURE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. AS TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT DAY- CAN- MAKE SURE THAT. THEY CONTINUE THEIR WORK NOW. SHOULD WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO THEIR DRUG OF. I IN HEARINGS NO OTHER COMMENTS I THINK THAT IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IN WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE WITH THE SUMMARY OF THIS IS THAT I'M LUCKY THERE ARE GUARDRAILS ON THIS THIS IS ONLY IN A TIME OF A GOVERNOR DECLARED DISASTER AND THIS IS BE HONEST. SOME OF THE WORST DISASTERS IN THE STATE HISTORY OUR GOVERNOR DECLARED DISASTER SO WHAT I CAN DO SAY IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WE'VE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN EVACUATED- AND- BUSINESS MUST CONTINUE BUT THE OTHER IMPORTANT GUARD RELIGION THIS IS THAT NOTICING REQUIREMENTS ARE STILL- INDEBTED IN THIS BILL- A HALF A THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS IN THE MEETING IT REQUIRES THAT THE GENDER PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY PURSUANT TO THE BROWN ACT- A TO HAVE TO GET THEY HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE TO HAVE THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS THE MEDIAN IN PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT. AND THE ONLY REASON WHY I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN REALLY CRITICAL NOT FOR THE SENATE MEMBER DIED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS IN TIMES OF NEED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS COME MORE pUNFORTUNATELY MORE AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS WE'VE HAD IN TURKEY MEANS EVACUATED OR BURN THROUGH SO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS BEEN REALLY CRITICAL IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THIS TOOL BUT ALSO BE VERY SPECIFIC IN WHEN THE TOOL CAN BE USE AND IT'S GOING TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT. SEND THE WRONG TURN OVER YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES WELL I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS MISTER CARE AND YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED THIS IS ABOUT- YOU KNOW BEING PREPARED FOR THE NEXT EMERGENCY. BUT CERTAINLY THE REASON WE DO THIS WORK IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY IN THIS WORK AS WELL YOU KNOW TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE- YOU KNOW WILL BE HEARD- AND THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW- MAINTAINED TO THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO WITH THAT.

MISTER MEMBER CONSENT OF THE COMMITTEE I WILL PRESENT THIS FOR A SUPPLEMENT GALLAGHER WHO HAD TO GO NORTH A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY. THIS BILL EXTENDS A SUNSET DATE FOR A PILOT PROGRAM NOW ACTION. THAT ENCOURAGES VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEMS IN THE CITIES THESE THREE CITIES EL MONTE MONTEBELLO AND WILLOW'S CALIFORNIA. THIS PROVIDING OF QUALITY AFFORDABLE POTABLE DRINKING WATER AND CLEAN WATER FOR OTHER PURPOSES IS REALLY CHALLENGING FOR VERY SMALL SYSTEMS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS. AND THEREFORE THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE. WITH OTHER SYSTEMS. IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON BROUGHT LEGISLATION FORWARD FOR EL MONTE IN MONTEBELLO IT WAS SUNSET IT AND THEY HAD ADDED WILLOWS ALSO TO THE BILL. BECAUSE OF COLVARD NINETEEN IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE CITIES ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF THIS CONSOLIDATION IN THOSE THREE CITIES. PRIOR TO THE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWO TWO YEAR- IT AT THE END THEY NEED A TWO YEAR EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET. THIS WOULD JUST HAPPEN THEN SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND GIVE THOSE RESIDENTS SOME CONFIDENCE AND HOPE. THAT THEY COULD GET THE RESOLUTION IN THE CONSOLIDATION. THIS IS A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW AS WE SPEAK WE'VE TO ARRANGE A- WATER HALL FROM A CITY.

AND I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE OF PUBLICLY AT YOUR PLACE WOULD BE TO WORK WITH I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOUGH SUBJECT AND I APPRECIATE AT YOUR ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS A NUMBER SO I CAN TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO YOU ON AB FOURTEEN OH ONE- AND I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING IN THE AND IT MEANS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF US WELL FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO HAVE ALL OF MY BILLS HEARD IN YOUR HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAYS YOU'RE THE ONLY FILL IN NICELY GRATEFUL- YES WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US TO ASIA BRING UP YOUR CONCERNS AND WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WILL DO IS THEY WILL NARROW THE- SCOPE OF THIS BILL AND NARROW THE- THE BUSES- BASICALLY BUS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL APPLY TO THAT IS REALLY THE HIGHEST HIGHER QUALITY BUS STOP AS OPPOSED TO A BUS LINES AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A WISE MOVE- SO AT THIS BILL WHICH IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE LA CAUCUS. IS A BILL THAT REALLY LOOKS TO DO A LOT OF THINGS ONE THING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BIG INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE AS A STATE AND THAT WE HAVE MADE MANY TIMES AS A REGION IN MAJOR TRANSIT I'M REALLY BEARS ALL THE FRUITS OF VALUE GOES TRANSIT STOPS CAN TAKE WHICH IS SUPPORTING A TO A TYPE OF LAND USE THAT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO WALK MORE TO BIKE MORE AND TO HAVE ADENSER MORE BUSINESS RICH ENVIRONMENT IT ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT IN MANY THAT ALL CITIES PRETTY MUCH EXCEPT FOR NOW A FEW CITIES. IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TAKING THE NEXT STEP HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH WHEN. IT COMES TO PARKING REGARD TELLING DEVELOPERS WHAT THEY MUST- PROVIDE. REGARDLESS OF. THE IS- OF THOSE. EVEN IF THEY'RE RIGHT NEXT TO A MAJOR TRANSIT STOP. NOW DEVELOPERS KNOW VERY WELL. WHAT THEIR TENANTS AND WHAT THEIR CLIENTS REQUIRE FOR PARKING AND YET CITIES. HANDCUFF THEM. IN ORDER TO DO THAT. SO IN CALIFORNIA. GENERALLY APARTMENTS MUST INCLUDE ONE OR TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT. AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES PROVIDING ONE SPACE FOR EVERYONE TO TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. SO WHAT IS THE RESULT OF THIS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S LED TO AN OVER ABOVE SUPPLY OF PARKING. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION PARKING SPACES WHICH COMES TO ABOUT TWO FOR EVERY RESIDENT. WE HAD THAT IS LED TO AN ASTONISHING TWO HUNDRED MILES OF LAND DEVOTED TO PARKING CARS IN LOS ANGELES. S. N. A STUDY BY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OF TWENTY ONE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FROM THE 39% OF THE PARKING WHICH IS REQUIRED BY THE CITY'S. FOR OVER FOUR HUNDRED SPACES WERE UNUSED AT A COST OF BETWEEN TWELVE AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. ALSO WE KNOW THAT WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE FUTURE AT WHAT POINT WE MIGHT REALLY REGRET HAVING SPENT SO MUCH MONEY. SO MANY RESOURCES AND SO MUCH LAND CREATING PARKING. UGH THE POLICY THAT WE HAVE NOW ENCOURAGES CAR DEPENDENCE AND DISCOURAGES MASS TRANSIT USE INCREASING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IT ALSO WORSENS CALIFORNIA SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE BY RAISING THE COST OF HOUSING PRODUCTION ON AVERAGE A GARAGE COSTS TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE TO BUILD. A COST THAT IS OFTEN PASSED ON TO HOUSEHOLDS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY OWN A CAR. RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO TO DENSITY BONUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE CONCERN IS THAT BECAUSE DEVELOPERS TAKE THAT PARKING REDUCTIONS AS PART OF DENSITY BONUS THAT MAYBE IF WE DO COUPLE THAT AND DON'T FORCE THEM TO BILL PARKING WE CAN SOMEHOW LEVERAGE THAT BACK TO THEM. HOWEVER THE ONLY REASON THE PARKING REDUCTIONS- INCLUDED A DENSITY BONUS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S JUST SERVICE THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY IT'S A THAT DENSITY AND THE ABILITY TO BUILD AFTER UNITS THAT ADDS VALUE TO THE BUILDING. NOT THAT ONE TIME COST REDUCTION OF THE PARKING HOW DO WE KNOW THIS FOR A FACT WE KNOW IT BECAUSE SAN DIEGO ELIMINATED MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AFTER THIS WAS ADOPTED THE CITY SAW MORE THAN A FOUR TIMES INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS PROVIDE. SO WE KNOW THAT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THAT'S NEEDED THAT ELIMINATING THAT MANDATE DOES NOT NEGATIVELY AFFECT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER DENSITY BONUS. AND WE HAVE HEARD TESTIMONY BY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCERS AT THIS WELL GIVEN THE KIND OF CERTAINTY THEY NEED TO BUILD WILL HELP THEM WITH FINANCING WILL IT WILL. ALLOW US TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ARE USING IN ADDITION DEVELOPERS WHO ARE BUILDING FOR THE MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING THAT IS NOT SUBSIDIZED THEY'RE NOT GETTING TAX CREDITS FOR. FOR ABLE TO BUILD UNITS AND RENT THEM AT A LOWER COST IF THEY CAN PROVIDE LESS PARKING OR THE ABILITY TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE WITH PARKING LIKE PROVIDING TANDEM PARKING. AND WE'VE HEARD THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM DEVELOPERS PERSONALLY I'VE HEARD FROM SMALL DEVELOPERS PEOPLE THAT ON TWO OR THREE UNITS COULD SQUEEZE IN ANOTHER UNIT BUT AREN'T ALLOWED TO BUY THEIR CIT BECAUSE OF PARKING. REQUIREMENTS AND THEY KNOW THEIR TENANTS DON'T NEED. THE BILL CAN. TO REQUIRE PARKING FOR THE DISABLED AND FOR A LUXURY CARS. IT IS NOT. PART OF BUILDING OWNERS FROM PROVIDING PARKING. IN FACT IN PLACES THAT HAVE DONE THIS LIKE BUFFALO NEW YORK WE STARTED I BELIEVE FIVE YEARS AGO. ONE OF THE BELPER STILL INCLUDE PARKING INSTALL. YOU KNOW A QUITE A BIT OF PARKING BUT IT GIVES US A BILL APPROVED THE FLEXIBILITY TO RIGHT SIZE THE PARKING FOR THEIR NEEDS AND THE NEEDS OF THEIR TENANTS. AB FORTINO ONE IS SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA YIMBY CBRE ABUNDANT HOUSING LA AND THE COUNCIL OF INFILL BUILDERS. IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. BAY AREA COUNSEL CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE NRDC. THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND TRANSFORM AND I WILL SAY A GREAT MIX OF BUSINESS GROUPS. AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND HOUSING GROUPS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF COUNCIL MEMBERS ACT HOLDEN FROM THE GUILD FROM KILL RIGHT. AND MIA KANG THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RELATED CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER I WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS HERE WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE BILL ON EIGHTY. FOURTEEN A LINE ITEM FOURTEENER GENDA.

A PORTABLE HOUSING. AND A BOARD MEMBER WITH THE COUNCIL INFILL BUILDERS AND ONE OF THE BILL'S PROUD CO SPONSOR. AND AS YOU HEARD PARKING REQUIREMENTS PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVER OF HOUSING COSTS AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CALIFORNIA TODAY. BY ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS AND ALLOWING DEVELOPERS FLEXIBILITY TO RIGHT BY THE PARKING. WE BELIEVE EIGHTY FOURTEEN NO ONE WILL. CONTRACTED TWO THOUSAND. AND SLASH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OFF THE COST OF NEW HOUSING- WHAT THE POTENTIAL FOR CALIFORNIANS VACANT BUILDINGS AND UNDER UTILIZED LAND BY. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EIGHTY FOUR G. MAIL ON WILL ALSO HELP. MAKE CALIFORNIA DENSITY BONUS LAW INCLUDING HOUSING PROGRAMS OF WORK EVEN MORE PRODUCTIVELY. WE WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD PARKING. RIGHT BY THE PARKING LOT IN SOME OF OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT IN LA'S. TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITY PROJECT HAS. BEEN APPROVED- OVER EIGHTY OF ALL OF THE DEVELOPERS OF ABSOLUTELY- UTILIZED ALL OF THEIR GAMES CITY. BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDED MORE PARTY THAT JUST AND THEN I'M ON REQUIRED SO BY BALANCING BY ALLOWING DEVELOPERS TO BALANCE THE COULD PRODUCE THE HOUSING. IN THE AREAS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN EXISTING COMMUNITIES AB FORTINO ONE OF THE SIMPLEST MOST DIRECT ACTION THE STATE CAN TAKE TODAY TO LOWER THE COST OF NEW TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND TURN BACK THE CLOCK. ACCORDING TO CHANGE FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE COMMITTEE I VOTE AND WE REALLY THANK YOU ALSO FOR HER INCREDIBLE LEADERSHIP.

TURN THEM IN GOT THE- WITH WEAPONS ARE AMONG. WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OF UNLESS. TO EIGHTY FOURTEEN THERE ONE. WESTERN CENTER WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREED TO SUPPORT THE AUTHORS INTENDED GALDERMA EXCESSIVE PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND ENCOURAGE HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES LESS RELIANT ON GREENHOUSE GAS THE CARD. UNFORTUNATELY AB FORTINO ONE CURRENTLY DOES NOT STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN POLICY OBJECTIVES AND THE DEEPLY CRITICAL GOAL OF INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. REALLY INTENSELY OFFER YOUR OWN AND YOUR TRANSIT 4% AFFORDABLE PROJECT. PROVIDING A COMPETITIVE EDGE THE PROJECT IN MANY MARKETS A COMPETITIVE EDGE THAT THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE IN ITS CURRENT FORM. REMOVING THAT ADVANTAGE ENCOURAGES MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT NEAR TRANSIT THAT IS LESS THAN AND CONTAINS NO AFFORDABLE UNITS. WE BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS IS A POLICY OF CAPTURING VALUE THAT IS BEING CREATED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE PARKING TO PRODUCE HOUSING. FOR BOTH THE MALE OF THE HOUSEHOLD. REQUEST IS NOT WHETHER WE ELIMINATE YOUR- WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ELIMINATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE DONE IN COORDINATION WITH MIXED INCOME AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS REMARKS. OR DEALING TRONG THAT THE BONUS. AS AB FORTY NO ONE IN THE CURRENT FORM. MORE SIMPLY AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE ELIMINATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS. DAN INCLUSIONARY DEVELOPMENT OR LEFT AND INCLUSIONARY DEVELOPMENT. MANY CITIES ARE ALREADY LEVERAGING THAT THE BONUS BOND LOWERING PARKING MINIMUM. CITY OF LA HAS DONE THAT LOOK AT THE CAPITOL TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. AND AS AUTHOR MENTOR AND MENTIONED BENDIGO HAS LOWER PARKING MINIMUM WE JUST AND TRAFFIC. BUT HAVE ALSO MADE CHANGES RECENTLY TO INCREASE A. B. L. U. COURAGE AMONG DEVELOPERS. PROJECT MAKING USE OF REGARD REDUCED PARKING REQUIREMENTS AND THAT THE PRODUCT TOGETHER. IS IDEAL THE OUTCOME. IN TO GET YOU THE- GOAL WITHOUT HIM BRING AMERICA BY WHICH DEVELOPER INCREASE. WE WOULD THE FROM THE BILL THAT A LIVE PARK MINIMUMS RENDON THAT. YOUR OR THE DEVELOPER UTILITY. DENSITY BONUS LAW OR INCLUDES TEN ARE YOU GONNA. ORIGINALLY THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENT NOT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND GIVEN OUR HOUSING CRISIS. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FORGO AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING YOU PROJECT INTO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FRAMEWORK AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE ANY AFFORDABILITY ON THE PEOPLE. WE SHOULD USE THE POLICY THAT. POLICY OPTION THAT REDUCES PARKING AND INCREASES AFFORDABILITY TOGETHER. SO WE REALLY THINK THAT WHENEVER FRIEDMAN AND HER STAFF AS WELL THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING OUR CONCERNS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION TO ACCOMPLISH A POLICY THAT WORKS FOR A CLIMATE TRANSPORTATION HOUSING AND EQUITY GOALS REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH RISKS YOU REPEAT YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AS WELL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THAT THE CHAIR. OF FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR- ON ON THIS BILL AND FOR COMING TO GETTING GETTING TO YES AND- COMING UP WITH- WITH AMENDMENTS TO COMMUTE TO GO FOR SOME VERY APPRECIATIVE THE CHAIR. FIVE TAKING TIME AND ENERGY TO DO THAT ONE THING THE AUTHOR. FOR MOVING US FORWARD SAYS IN THE FIRST TIME THIS BILLS COMPONENTS CENTER SKINNER WHEN SHE WAS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SKINNER- INTRODUCE BROUGHT POINT. AND IT'S A VERY- IMPORTANT BILL AND I THINK IT'S DRIVE AN ECHO HERE. OF IT. OKAY IS IT BETTER NOW OKAY ON THIS IS IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IN THIS GENERAL ISSUE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TO BE A PARTICULAR RESPECTFUL OF THE WESTERN CENTER IS. POSITION I UNDERSTAND I'M A HUGE SUPPORTER OF THE DENSITY BONUS- AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I RESPECT OF YOU BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE PILLARS OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. THESE PARKING REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES OBSCENE. I MEAN IN SOME PLACES SAN FRANCISCO ELIMINATED. A PARKING REQUIREMENTS A FEW YEARS AGO NOT AS PART OF DENSITY BONUS SIMPLY GOT RID OF THEM WHAT THE WHAT THE AUTHORS PLAN TO DO IN PROGRESS OF SAN FRANCISCO WHERE WE HAVE A HIGH INCLUSIONARY WITH TRULY BELIEVE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE GOT RID OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. BUT AT LEAST IN SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE THAT WE HAD HAD A LOT OF POINT TWO FIVE IN POINT FIVE TRUCK CALIFORNIA THE NUMBER OF LIKE. ONE TO ONE ONE PARKING SPOT PER UNIT OR TWO TO ONE. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. AND IT ABSOLUTELY EXPLODES THE COST OF BUILDING ANY KIND OF HOUSING. CAN NINE FIFTY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. TO THE COST OF BUILDING THAT HOUSING. IT ALSO MEANS THAT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU BUILD. YOUR YOU HAVE AN ENVELOPE THAT YOU BUILT ON WITH SETBACKS AND HEIGHTS AND- IT'S ALL YOU CAN BUILD INTO INFINITY. AND YET YOU AND- WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEVOTE LIKE HALF OF THE SPACE- THIRD OF THE SPACE. THE CARS. THAT HAVE FURTHER TO THE SPACE IT'S NOT GOING TO PEOPLE. IT MEANS YOU ARE BUILDING WAS HOUSING. DELIVERING FEWER UNITS. AND THE UNITS YOU ARE DELIVERING. ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IT IS INCREDIBLY PERNICIOUS AND EVAN SO MANY STUDIES. AND BOOKS WRITTEN ON THIS. GUY IT'S LIKE WE CARE MORE ABOUT CARS THAN WE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE. FOR LIVING IN CARS AND DUMPSTERS AND TEN PERSONS TEN PEOPLE TO OUR UNIT. AND WE'RE JUST OBSESSING ABOUT DEDICATING MORE AND MORE SACE THAT SHOULD BE HOUSING. AND DEDICATING AT. THE HOUSE CARS INSTEAD OF PEOPLE. AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST TOO MUCH AND IT'S TIME TO AND THEN WE ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT I MEAN SOME OF THEM PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT. WORKING MINIMUM TO GETTING RID OF IT THEY THINK OH MEANS NO PARKING IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT. IT MEANS THAT WENT OUT DEVELOPMENT IS BEING FORMULATED YOU CAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS THE NEEDED PARKING. THERE IF PARKING IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO ATTRACT PEOPLE LIVE THERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE PARKING IF IT'S NOT THEN THEY'LL BE LESS PARKING OR NO PARKING AND SO HAVING THAT FLEXIBILITY- IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT SO AS A MATTER OF. I JUST ABOUT CLIMATE AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE I AGREE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER WE WANT TO. HAVE A STRONG DENSITY BONUS BUT IF WE ARE REDUCING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING SO DRAMATICALLY THAT MAKES HOUSING. MORE AFFORDABLE- THE DENSITY BONUS HAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR EAGLE. OTHER THAN PARKING YOU DO YOU GET MORE HOW YOU CAN AFFECTS THAT BACKS YOU CAN IN FACT THAT THEY ARE THERE SO MANY OF- ADVANTAGES THE DENSITY BONUS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PARKING. PARKING STANDS ON ITS OWN WE NEED TO GET RID OF THESE MINIMUMS. AND SOME HAPPY TO MOVE THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH. SENATOR AND DO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON- AS HOUSING SHARES WELL IN VERY GRATEFUL TO BE WORKING WITH YOU SO LET'S GO TO CENTER DRAWS OF PLEASE. YES- I- I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE AUTHOR HOT THERE AND I TALK ABOUT. THESE ISSUES ALL THE TIME AND FEEL- VERY FORTUNATE THAT. FEES THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THE WAY THAT THEY CAN DO AND THEN THE GREAT. BUT I DO SEE A ARM MORE OF AN IMPACT IN THE AND IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE WE START OUT THINKING THAT WAY I KNOW AND THE ONLY DELEGATION YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE YOU BROUGHT IT UP AND I WAS SUPPORT OF- I AND- THINK THAT THE- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE THAT. ALL WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THERE IT'S A REALITY AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO WORK HARDER AT NOT HAVING A OVER BALANCE ON THE SIDE OF. THE WHICH WE ALL BELIEVE IN PREACHING TO THE CHOIR HERE YOU KNOW THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF SMOG AND THE POLLUTION- I GET THAT. I KNOW THAT BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST AND MOST CONTAMINATED AREAS. YOU KNOW SOIL WATER YOU NAME IT- SO I AM ABSOLUTELY THERE ON THAT ISSUE. BUT THERE IS- IMPACT AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IMPACT THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON. AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I KNOW EVERY TIME I BRING THIS UP I WAS IN R. R. SENATE WORKING GROUP ON HOUSING WE HAVE GOT TO DO IT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE- THE PROPOSALS. TO ADDRESS CLEANER AIR I SEE THE LIST OF ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS- BUT ON THE OPPOSITION THERE ARE SOME VERY LEGITIMATE DOWN TO EARTH ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WORK ON THESE ISSUES EVERY DAY AS OF YOU KNOW THEY ALSO HAVE REYES THIS UNITED. IT'S BEEN A ISSUE OF HOUSE FOR A HOMELESSNESS FOR MANY YEARS C. B. E. R. YOU NAME IT SO THE ARE A- THAT REALLY ARE ON THE GROUND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO BE. AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE JUST HAVE TO PAY SOME MORE ATTENTION ALL OF US ON WHAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES COULD BE SO I REALLY- YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU MENTIONED- YOU KNOW THERE'S NO PARKING BUT THERE'S PARKING FOR ELECTRIC CARS IN ALL. OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKELY THE ONES TO BE DRIVING THE ELECTRIC CARS BUT THAT'S PROVIDED FOR HERE- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST- HOUSE- WORKING FOR HOUSING BUT THERE'S PARKING FOR THE COMMERCIAL AREAS OR NO PARKING FOR THE COMMERCIALS AREAS. SO I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE VERY STRONGLY TO WORK ON TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ARE I'M NOT GOING TO IGNORE THAT THE ISSUES AS THEY'VE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO ME. AND AS I'M LEARNING BETTER WHAT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARE AND I REALLY ASK THE AUTHOR AUG TO BE TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP FURTHER. AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THAT MIGHT BE I KNOW YOU'RE VERY COMMITTED TO THIS I KNOW YOU PUT YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO IT ALL BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE- THE CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED. BY YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE- INVOLVED WITH LW INCOME COMMUNITIES- EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY SEE THE IMPACT AND SO I REALLY URGE YOU I'M GONNA SUPPORT TODAY BUT I REALLY. I JUST ASK THE AUTHOR DEGAN. EVEN TO A LOT OF A GREATER LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT WE HAVE GOT TO WE CAN'T LET THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES BE PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THAT HAPPENS TO A LARGE AND I. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN HERE SO. FOR MY COMMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SANDRA'S I KNOW THOSE ARE HARD SHELL IS WELL INTO AS ALWAYS. SHE'S CARRYING A TWO CRITICAL PIECES OF HOUSING LEGISLATION SURE AS WELL AND- ALONG WITH CENTER WIENER IS REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON HOUSING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE- IT INCLUDING YOUR- HOMELESS TAX CREDIT BY THE WAY WHICH IS IN THE BUDGET WHICH IS JUST AMAZING AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT AS WELL.

WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO BE A PROCEED AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE WORK ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR THE KIND THE INTRO MISTER CARE MEMBERS THAT WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE MEASURE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT NARROW THE- NUISANCE AUTHORITY TO ALLOW DISTRICTS TO ONLY DECLARE ENCROACHMENTS. AS A NUISANCE- REMOVE THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AUTHORITY FROM THE BILL AND THREE MAKE OTHER TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING CHANGES. NINE FIVE NINE WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW INDEPENDENT PARKED RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS A MULTITUDE. OF PUBLIC NUISANCES THAT THEY REGULARLY CONFRONT. EXAMPLES OF NUISANCES ON PARK DISTRICT LANDS INCLUDE ILLEGAL WATER DIVERSION EXTENSION OF YARDS IN THE PARK HABITAT ILLEGAL DUMPING AND GRADING. ON AUTHORIZED LANDSCAPING A LEGAL STREAMBED ALTERATION ALL OF WHICH IMPACT SENSITIVE HABITAT WILDFIRE PROTECTION ZONES AND OTHER PARK SPECIFIC USES. HER DISTRICTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ILLEGAL ENCROACHMENTS IN THE SAME COMPREHENSIVE WAY THAT CITIES. COUNTIES AND OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS CAN. GIVEN THE PARK DISTRICTS ARE BEST SUITED TO. ADDRESS LAND STEWARDSHIP AND MANAGEMENT ISSUES ON ITS OWN LANDS. PROVIDING PARK DISTRICTS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE NUISANCE ABATEMENT TOOLS WILL BE THE MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. THIS MEASURE IS NO OPPOSITION HAS ENJOYED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF SUPPORT WEST WITNESSES FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PARK DISTRICTS WILL. BE ON THE PHONE I BELIEVE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MULLIN HEALTH. AND THE YOU DO. A GROUP WHAT. HELLO EVEN CORRECTIVE. LET ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES.

GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GO AHEAD WE HAVE A PERSON HERE PERSONALLY AND PRESENT PRESENT TOO I GUESS BUT NO OKAY GO AHEAD. HELLO GO AHEAD THANK YOU REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY NINE FIVE NINE. NINE HILARY STEPHENSON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR MID PENN REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT. AMID PENN OWNS AND MANAGES TWENTY SIX OPEN SPACE PRESERVES YOUR THEIR CREATORS SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS REGION AND OUR DISTRICT SPENT PORTIONS OF THREE COUNTIES AND SEVENTEEN CITIES. HANLAN'S SERVES AS AN A GREEN BELT FOR A DENSELY POPULATED URBAN AREA AND ALTHOUGH WE PROACTIVELY COORDINATE AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. PROBLEMS OCCASIONALLY ARISE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN ALREADY DESCRIBED SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES OF ISSUES THAT WE COULD ADDRESS USING THE MUSIC ABATEMENT PROCESS. THAT WOULD- YOU WOULD HELP US DELIVER OUR MISSION TO PROTECT NATURAL WATERCOURSES PRESERVE NATURAL LANDSCAPES REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AND PROTECT PUBLIC ACCESS TO OUR PRISONERS WE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO HEAR THIS BILL IT WOULD AFFORD OUR AGENTS BE MORE A TANAMI AND FLEXIBILITY IN OUR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM THANK YOU OR YOUR TIME I'M GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE. MODERATOR WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL WHAT NASH PRINCIPAL WITNESS RACHEL CENTER. AND YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY THIS IS RACHEL SATYR- ASSISTANT DISTRICT COUNCIL FOR THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT. THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT IS A MULTI COUNTY REGIONAL PARK AND OPEN SPACE DISTRICT CREATED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE OF COURSE FUNCTION OF THE PARK DISTRICT LIKE ANY PART DISTRICT IS THE STEWARDSHIP OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES WITHIN OUR BOUNDARIES. THIS RESPONSIBILITY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CRITICAL GIVEN THE PRESSING NEED TO ADDRESS A CHANGING CLIMATE. THE PARK DISTRICT FOR DISTRICTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLANNING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A SYSTEM OF PARK LANDS HOWEVER BECAUSE OUR PARK DISTRICTS DO NOT HAVE LAND USE POWER LIKE CITIES AND COUNTIES THE LEGAL TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USES OF PARK LANDS ARE STRICTLY LIMITED TO THOSE GRANTED BY STATUTE. AN EXAMPLE WHERE PARK DISTRICT'S STATUTORY GRANT ABOUT FORTY IS LIMITED COMPARED TO CITY AND COUNTY IS THE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. IT IS FOR THIS REASON I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN SPELL A. B. NINE FIVE NINE IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW IT WOULD PROVIDE PARK DISTRICT WITH A VALUABLE TOOL. TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THEIR PARK LANDS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN- ALREADY IDENTIFIED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- ILLEGAL ENCROACHMENTS THAT WE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE IN ONE OF THESE EXAMPLES- THE PARK DISTRICT WAS FORCED TO TURN TO CIVIL COURT PROCEEDINGS TO ADDRESS THE ENCROACHMENT. WHICH WAS COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. AND EVEN AFTER WE GOT A JUDGMENT AGAINST THIS ENCROACHING PROPERTY OWNER HE HAS CONTINUED TO ENCROACH ON PARK DISTRICT PROPERTY. DUE TO OUR LIMITED ENFORCEMENT TOOLS. BY COMPARISON HAVING THE ABILITY TO ADMINISTRATIVELY ABATE THESE TYPES OF ENCROACHMENTS WOULD BE COST EFFECTIVE. AND HELP THE PARK DISTRICT EFFICIENTLY CARRY OUT ITS LAND STEWARDSHIP MISSION.

A WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOMEBODY'S AMENDMENTS AND USER- YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE VERY SOLID-AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY. HAVING THEIR STRENGTH AND MAKE A LOT OF GOOD CLARIFICATIONS. ON THE BILL IN TERMS OF TIME LINES ET CETERA. I DON'T HAVE A TO SUPPORT THESE AMENDMENTS- TODAY OF THE ONE OF THE ONE AMENDMENT THAT- TURNS FROM A VOLUNTARY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES TO A- MANDATORY ADMINISTRATIVE EXHAUSTION. PROCESS BEFORE FILING A HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. LAWSUIT IS ONE DIED- I THINK WE DISCUSSED- NEEDS FURTHER REFINEMENT- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT. LEADING TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE ANY OF US. I INTEND AND SO- I THINK OVER THE NEXT WEEK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BEGIN BY THANKING YOU PERSONALLY. AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE HARD WORK AND THE FOUGHT FOR ASSISTANCE AND- WE'RE GONNA BE ACCEPTING THESE COMMITMENTS TODAY BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ATTENTION THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US TO WORKING THROUGH THE BILL- REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND YOUR PROFESSIONALISM YOUR REALLY TO MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE TO HAVE THOSE CAR. REALLY GREATLY A- AND FORWARD CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH BOTH OF YOU AND ANTON AUS IN A JUST A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY BRING TO THE SO THANK YU VERY VERY MUCH FOR. FOR YOUR SINCERE ENGAGEMENT HERE I'M PLEASED TODAY TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS BILL WHICH WOULD CREATE A SPECIALIZED APPEAL PANEL. TO ADDRESS SITUATIONS WHERE LOCAL OFFICIALS SEEK TO PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN VIOLATION OF STATE LAW THIS IS A MODEST EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. IN THIS- ED DEALS WITH THAT EFFORTS TO BLOCK THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE APPLICABLE GENERAL PLAN. ZONING AND SUBDIVISION STANDARDS. AND REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN THE EVENT THAT THEY DO SO. PERSONALLY DESPITE ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEFIED THE ACT IN TONIGHT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL LOCAL ZONING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE OFFICIALS UNDERSTAND THAT IN MOST CASES AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPONENTS WILL HAVE NO PRACTICAL MEANS. TO CHALLENGE THE UNLAWFUL DENIAL AS THE CURRENT REMEDY. LITIGATION IN SUPERIOR COURT IS ALMOST ALWAYS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING AND OTHERWISE IMPRACTICAL. AB NINETY NINE WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY CREATING AN ALTERNATE PANEL WITH SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE. MODERN OFTEN PRO TO HAS SUCCESSFULLY BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER STATES THE JURISDICTION OF THE REVIEW PANEL WOULD BE LIMITED TO A NARROW SINGLE ISSUE. WHETHER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VIOLATED THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT BY DISAPPROVING A PROJECT WITHOUT MAKING THE APPROPRIATE FINDINGS AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IT WOULD JUST BE ABLE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES AROUND IMPROPER AND UNLAWFUL DENIALS ANYMORE EXPEDITED LESS EXPENSIVE LESS CONFRONTATIONAL AND MORE CONSISTENT MANNER. TO BE CLEAR AB NINE EIGHT NINE SIMPLY PROVIDES A NEW PROCEDURAL REMEDY TO RESOLVE DISPUTES IT DOES NOT UPS ON CHANGING THE LOCAL ZONING OR LAND USE POLICIES OR OTHERWISE CHANGE SUBSTANTIVE STATE LAW AROUND HOUSING. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE FOLLOW STATE LAW IN GOOD FAITH ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY INTERACTION WITH THIS PANEL WELL THOSE ARE THE BEEN ACTIVELY AND WILLFULLY VIOLATING THE LAW WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. THIS LESS ADVERSARIAL AND MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH IS SUPPORTED BY A COALITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUPS HOUSING ADVOCATES AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RAW HOUSING AND SACRAMENTO. MAYOR MEANT SACRAMENTO MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY- MARK STIVERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP IN TWENTY THREE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THANK YOU AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS ELIMINATE ALL RIGHT SO LET'S IN GENERAL GONNA GO TO OR TO LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES ONE WHO WILL BE IN PERSON AND THE OTHER WILL BE ON OUR LIVE LINE WE'RE GONNA NOW TURN IT OVER.

THE PARTNERSHIP WAS ACTUALLY CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ADVICE ON- PRODUCTION AND PRESERVING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN THE BOOK THE PARTNERSHIP ALSO PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MOST OF THE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN THE STATE. OUR PARTNERS ARE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON WALKING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE PARTNERSHIP OFTEN HEARS FROM OUR DEVELOPERS THAT THEY ARE NOT THEY WILL NOT TAKE THE FINANCIAL RISK TO BUY A PROPERTY IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. WELL THE EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IN THEORY PROTECTS DEVELOPERS FROM ARBITRATE NILES. ARE UNREASONABLE CONDITIONS THE MAKE DEVELOPMENT IN FEW. IS A RELATIVE. AND PART- VERY FEW DEVELOPERS WILL SPEND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES INTEREST AND OTHER ADDITIONAL CARRYING COSTS AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF THEIR TIME TO GO THROUGH THE COURTS. AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS CUT PROCESS HAS BEEN TRYING TO PASS ACCESSIBLE IN MASSACHUSETTS WHERE IT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. RHODE ISLAND ILLINOIS AND OREGON. DEVELOPERS ACTUALLY USE THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS IN THE STATE'S WHEREAS. AND THEY THEY RARELY USE THE COURTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR DEVELOPER PARTNERS TELL US THAT EVEN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE RISK PROFILE. GIVING THEM GREATER CERTAINTY AND CONFIDENCE TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPOSAL FORWARD AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GET THEM BILL. AB NINETY NINE IS ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND I TO JUST WANT TO THANK THE TWO CHAIRS OF THE HOUSING IN THE GOVERNANCE OF FINANCE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR EXTREME- ENGAGEMENT IN THESE BILLS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE FINE DETAILS.

UNFORTUNATELY BILL IMPRINT WE DO HAVE IN A POSITION THANK YOU MISTER PRIME LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT CALLER. SURE THERE ARE NO IN THE QUEUE MANIMAL WRITER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE GOT ANOTHER BILL TO GO SO WELL AND THAT'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS CONCERNS OF MOTION PLEASE. MOVE THE BILL. ON HERE'S ONE MATE TWO COMMENTS JUST TO BE. CLEAR A COUPLE OF THINGS- A BIG FAN OF MR STIVERS I DO ACTUALLY OF A DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HA I AGREE THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE HA WAS BORDERLINE. DEAD LETTER NO ONE WAS USING IT- WE ACTUALLY THANKS TO LEADERS OF THE CENTER SKINNER. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- DREW SIGNIFICANTLY BEEFED UP THE HA THE REMEDIES ABILITY TO USE THAT. ABILITY TO GET ATTORNEYS FEES AND I THINK EVEN IF I RECALL CORRECTLY PENALTIES- FROM. CITIES THAT WAS A VERY HARD BILL THAT REALLY GAVE LIFE TO AND I'VE SEEN. IN THE BAY AREA. I'M INCLUDING MY OWN HOMETOWN- WE HAVE SEEN. OUR DEVELOPERS BE WILLING TO SUE. US CITIES AND CITIES HAVE TO. PAY ATTORNEY'S FEES AND I THINK IT HAS ACTUALLY SHIFTED THE DYNAMIC CITIES NO INCLUDING MY OWN CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN- 100% TIME THE BEST DR. CITY OF BERKELEY WHICH USED TO BE A VERY BAD ACTOR AND JUST RECENTLY DENYING PROJECTS WEALTHY CITIES ON THE PENINSULA. SO I THINK IT HAS HAD A REAL IMPACT I BUT I DO AGREE THAT HAVING. A MINUTE MINISTRY TO PROCESS- WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE POLITICIZATION. IS A GOOD IDEA AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT THOSE ARE BUILT ON THERE'S I KNOW THAT- THERE'S GONNA FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THIS BILL BUT TO BE CLEAR IT'S OFTEN I'VE DISCUSSED. THIS BILL APPLIES AS LONG AS THERE'S 20% AFFORDABILITY- WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE INCLUSIONARY ABOUT A LOT YOU KNOW A FAIR NUMBER OF CITIES. HAVE SO A LOT OF SUPERMARKET RATE WITH INCLUSIONARY MIXED INCOME HOUSING WILL BE PART OF THIS- AS WELL AND SO AS WE DO THESE CLARIFICATIONS- THEY NEED TO BE. ABLE TO- BUT I'M HAPPY. THE BILL- WITH MACHINE ON THE- BY. AS SOON WE PLEASE ENTER. YEAH- SINCE THIS IS BY BACK AND FOR THE BILL HERE WITH THE- AND WHAT WAS THEIR- HE- ME THROUGH. WHAT THIS NOW MEANS THE END RESULT. WHAT ARE THE CHANGES COMBINING WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY HAD. WITH THE AMENDMENTS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NOW. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SENATORS SO- ALL WALKING THROUGH THEM AND THEN OF COURSE IF THAT THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANY COMMENTS TO THAT. SO PART OF THIS IS BEFORE WE WERE HAVE- A NUMBER OF FOLKS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE- APPOINTEES OF THE GOVERNOR AND OTHER FOLKS THAT WERE COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR HAD EXPERTISE. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE NOW REPLACE THAT WITH A PANEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. SO WE'LL HAVE THOSE FOLKS INSTEAD OF THE APPOINTEES- A SUNSET IT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY NINE. THE CAN OCCUR- ONLY AFTER THE LOCAL AGENCY HAS MADE A FINAL DECISION. SO THAT'S CLEAR- BUT WE'VE ALSO BUILT IN TIME FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY TO CURE THE DECISION- SO THAT IF THAT. IF THEY MAKE A DECISION AND THEN THERE'S SOME DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER IT'S COMPLIANCE COMPLYING WITH THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT THE PARTIES WOULD THEN HAVE. SOME TIME TO GO BACK AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY FELT GOOD ABOUT. BEFORE THAT. REVIEW PROCESS WOULD BE TRIGGERED- THERE WERE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO A FEW TIME LINES IN THE BILL- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT THAT THE TIMELINE WAS WORKABLE- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THIS FINAL POINT. ABOUT USING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS NOT FIRST SO THOSE WERE THE THOSE ARE THE MAJOR- THOSE ARE THE MAJOR MINUTES I THINK I'VE YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT ANYTHING MR CHAIRMAN THAT'S THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE- YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH SPOT ON THERE AS A MEMBER I THINK THAT THE ONE PIECE THAT WE- HAD FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO GOING INTO. A POTENTIAL CORRECTIVE ACTION BEING ABLE TO GET THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE SIXTY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET IT DONE UNDER THEIR J. I DIDN'T DEATH TO BE ABLE TO CORRECT IT. NUMBER ONE. AND THEN RATHER THAN ANY OF THE POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS. WE'RE TAKING A VERY SIMILAR APPROACH THAT WE DO WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHERE WE HAVE A CONTENT EXPERT IS ADMINISTERED LAW JUDGE. HEARING THAT AS WELL- SO THAT'S THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED IT SIMPLY- THE PROCESS. RELATING TO WHO. AND IN WHAT TIMELINE I WILL HEAR ANY OF THESE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS. SO IT SO THE- THERE'S STILL- THE OP. THERE'S STILL THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT. YOU HAVE TO GO TO LITIGATION THEY EVEN. EVEN WITH THIS PROCESS IT IT IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTE TO SAY THAT IN INDIVIDUALS IN FRONT OF THE MINISTRY OF LOGICS THEY HAVE TO BE TO COMPLETE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JEFF PROCESS BUT THEN THEY COULD TAKE- THE JURISDICTION TO COURT. AFTER THEY. GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT DOES ELIMINATE THE LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT DOESN'T. OF THEIR LIVES AND A NUMBER YOU CAN AND I'M I JUST HAD ONE OF THE THINGS OR IF I MAY THAT. FOR THEIR DIFFERENT CLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS PEOPLE WHO CAN BRING CHALLENGE UNDER THE HOUSING KIND OF ALL THE ACT AND SO FOR. CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OR PROSPECTIVE TENANTS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO COURT THE- THE REVIEW PANEL. IS INTENDED SPECIFICALLY FOR APPLICANTS RICHEST DEVELOPERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO WOULD YOU CONSIDER THIS THAT IT'S GOING TO. EXPEDITE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPEDITE. BUT IT STILL GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO STILL GIVES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT SO. HOW HOW DOES THAT REALLY EXPEDITE CORRECTIVE CHAU- THE IDEA HERE AND PART OF THIS IS BASED ON- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS IN THE FIELD BUT ALSO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE. THAT HAVE ADOPTED THIS APPROACH. IF SOMEBODY NOW. D. FILES A LAWSUIT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD IT'S GOING TO TAKE THEM TO YEARS OF TIME RIGHT TED WE'VE GOT GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF LITIGATION IT'S GONNA COST THEM HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TO HAVE THAT LITIGATED- AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THAT PROCESS MIGHT WORK OUT. IT'S A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE SAIDTHEY ARE EXTREMELY RELUCTANT EVEN WHEN THERE'S A CLEAR. OPEN VIOLATION OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION PROCESS AND SO. THIS PANEL IS SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN GO BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINES THAT ARE SET UP. YOU CAN GET A DECISION MUCH MORE QUICKLY. YOU CAN HAVE A LESS ADVERSARIAL PROCESS- LESS EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND WHAT REALLY STRUCK TO ME ABOUT THIS. IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RE THAT WAS DONE ON HOW IT'S BEEN IN. ANOTHER STATES BUT MASTER. A VERY SICK. NUMBER OF THESE. THESE APPEAL. ACTION OF SADDAM THEY'RE NOT HEARD BY THE BOY SO. THE ME FACT THAT THERE AN APPEAL. SURE TO GET THE- TO GO. THEY CAN NEGOTIATED FAITH OUT A DEAL GET TO YES AND BE ABLE TO. TO PROCEED FOR TO THE IDEA HERE IS TO CREATE. A PROCESS THAT IS LESS CONFRONTATIONAL LESS EXPENSIVE QUICKER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH EXPERTS AS AS THE AS THE CHAIRMAN. CHEN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES WHO HAVE DEEP SOUTH. EXPERTISE WHO CAN HELP TO RESOLVE THESE TO. MARC OKAY. WELL YOU'RE HOPEFUL. RIGHT THIS IS THIS IS B. THAT THIS WILL IN FACT HELP. OF TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO THE PARTIES TOGETHER TO THE FALL I GUESS I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT IF THEY'RE STILL THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT THEN IS THIS ANOTHER. ANOTHER DELAY. YOU KNOW IN THE PROCESS YEAH I DON'T TO SENATE SENATOR IF I MAY YOU KNOW THAT THAT MIGHT MY HOPE HERE IS BORN OUT OF TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS THE RESEARCH WHICH- WAS DONE BY MIT. THAT HELPED US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS. IN IN IN YOU KNOW IN PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS WHERE YOU'VE HEARD IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL DECADES- AND ALSO MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS AN ATTORNEY- AND UNDERSTANDING THE RELUCTANCE OF PEOPLE TO GO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN THE LITIGATION PROCESS JUST HOW EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE. AND TIME CONSUMING CAN BE IT SO OFTEN LITIGATION TO GET INTO COLLATERAL ISSUES OF. WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE DISCOVERED DISCOVERY WHOSE DEPOSITION YOU GET TO TAKE I MEAN YOU CAN JUST GO DOWN ALL KINDS OF RABBIT HOLES IN THE LITIGATION PROCESS. AND YOU KNOW IN SOME WAYS THIS IS MORE I CAN TO YOU KNOW AN EXPEDITED- NEGOTIATION PROCESS OR OR AN EXPEDITED RESOLUTION PROCESS WHERE THE WHERE THE PARTIES CAN GET TOGETHER. GET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE WITH IT WITH AN EXPERTISE WITH WITH FOLKS WITH EXPERTISE. GET SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION SO ULTIMATELY THERE IS THAT OPTION OF LITIGATION AT AT THAT THAT STILL REMAINS. BUT I THINK BECAUSE OF INCENTIVES IN ECONOMICS AND TIME AND A LOT OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS THEY'RE GONNA BE VERY STRONG INCENTIVES FOR FOLKS TO USE THE APPEAL PANEL RATHER THAN TO ENTER INTO LITIGATION. AND I KNOW THE ONLY SAY THAT I'M SORRY NOT TRYING TO BE CYNICAL OR NEGATIVE BUT- OBVIOUSLY- ANY ENTITIES THE FIGHTS. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY GET PRETTY A DUG IN THEIR HEELS SO I'M HOPEFUL. ON AND I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. PLEASE NO THANK YOU ACCESS I WANT US TO RESPOND FURTHER TO US IN REQUIRE CENTER ROSS'S QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY THE ISSUES YOU RAISE ARE EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DISCUSSING FOR THE FINAL AMENDMENT WHICH- THE BILL AS INTRODUCED MAKES THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OPTIONAL TO SOMEONE CAN GO TO COURT RIGHT WHERE THEY WANT WHERE THEY CAN PURSUE THIS AND MANY PEOPLE WILL PURSUE THE- OFF IF THEY HAVE AN OPTION THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE BECAUSE IT IS. I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S CHEAPER IT'S FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT BUT THEN THERE ARE OF COURSE THERE ARE THE DESTRUCTION OF CITIES THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY WHATEVER WE KNOW WE SORT OF KNOW WHO THEY ARE- WHERE THERE COULD BE AN UNSETTLED QUESTION OF LAW THAT REALLY ALL TO MY HOUSE TO GO TO THE COURTS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- REALLY WORKING ON NEXT WEEK IS TO MAKE SURE THAT FIRST SOLAR THERE REALLY FIRM TIME LINE SO YOU CAN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN A IF IT IS GOING TO BE NOT A GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS BUT YOU'RE NOT CAUGHT UP INDEFINITELY AND YOU CAN GO TO COURT IF YOU NEED TO. AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE A VERY MEANINGFUL COURT REMEDY AND WE'RE NOT EVEN FOR ME UNDERMINE IT I'M NOT SO WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON OVER. THE NEXT WEEK I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL GET THERE. ALL RIGHT. IN ADDITIONAL. BECAUSE CAN. FROM COMMITTEE.
