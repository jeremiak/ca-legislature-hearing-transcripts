00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:30.416
AT SOME POINT TIME BE PUT BACK

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:32.885
INTO USE SO WHY NOT.

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.120
THIS IS ALL THAT CAN.

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.088
BUT THE THE BILL DOES REQUIRE US

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.423
TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR RAIL

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.892
BANKING SYSTEM WAS THAT WE'D

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:42.261
LIKE TO LOOK AT TWO X..

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.397
YOUR MY THOUGHTS WAS AS PART OF

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:45.331
THE AND MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA LOOK

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.432
INTO THIS JUST CONVERT.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.035
TRANSFERRED TO STATE PARKS.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.638
ARE COUNTY PARKS FOR THE PURPOSE

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:56.209
OF A VICTIM SO THAT'S THANK.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.344
YOU HAVE A COMMENT.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.178
I'M WE WE DID NOT RAISE ANY

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:00.379
CONCERNS THAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.114
AND THE THE SITUATION ALONG THE

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.449
NORTH COAST A REAL.

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:06.252
I'M CORRIDOR AS AS THE NUMBER

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:06.953
YOU ARE YOUR NOSE IS THIS IS

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.421
BILL AND IS IS ACTUALLY FOR FOR

00:08:08.487 --> 00:08:09.956
REALLY COMPLICATED AND SO ON

00:08:10.022 --> 00:08:11.657
THAT THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:13.292
THE STUDY DID SEEM CONSISTENT --

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.127
WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT WE

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.028
DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.830
ADD TO YOUR QUESTION REGARDING

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.066
THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT VERSES

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.969
I'M LOOKING AT THE VIABILITY OF

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.238
THE TRAIL.

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:27.340
AND THAT THERE THERE ARE -- IT'S

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:28.474
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.309
SAM AND IT LIKE I'M INDIVIDUAL

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:30.910
AGREEMENTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:31.544
ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE NORTH

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.745
COAST RAIL AUTHORITY AND

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:33.713
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.281
AND AND GIVEN SORT OF THE

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.582
FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE NORTH

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:37.783
COAST RAIL AUTHORITY IT'S SORT

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.219
OF UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY THEY'VE

00:08:40.286 --> 00:08:41.587
ENTERED INTO AND SO IT WENT IF

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.089
WITH THE INTENT TO BEING TO

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.490
ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVE THAT.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.392
WHAT'S A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.960
CREATE SOMETHING NEW

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.495
UNDERSTANDING THE LEGAL

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.630
RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT WHAT

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.032
THEY'D ENTERED INTO IS IMPORTANT.

00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.533
SO THAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF IT

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.902
THE VIABILITY OF THE TRAIL AND

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:58.471
THIS IS A VERY LONG CORRIDOR AND

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:00.306
IN SOME CASES -- THERE'S BRIDGES

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.874
SPANNING RIVERS AND AND SOME

00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.809
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NOT

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.478
CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR RAIL

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:07.280
AND IS AND POTENTIALLY IN A

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.848
STATE OF DISREPAIR.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:10.249
THE OTHER ISSUE IF IT'S COST

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.984
SEEN -- PRIVATE PROPERTY ON YOUR

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.319
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND YOU HAVE

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.688
PEOPLE SAY HIKING ON A MULTI DAY

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.957
HIKE YOU WOULD NEED FACILITIES

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:18.891
AND THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.092
MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES YOU

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.560
NEED MAYBE CAMPING FACILITIES

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.895
BATHROOMS THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.196
AND SO THOSE ARE SORT OF THE TWO

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.197
DISTINCTIONS ONE IS ALMOST MORE

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.732
OF LIKE AN OSCAR PROCESS OF

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.533
UNDERSTANDING THE LEGAL

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.135
RAMIFICATIONS ON THE PROPERTY

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.569
AND THE OTHER ONE IS.

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.837
ON THE BUILD OUT OF THE TRAIL

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:33.372
COULD BE YOU KNOW COULD BE VERY

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:34.373
EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE IN THE

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.141
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:36.275
YOU MAY HAVE TO BUILD BRIDGES

00:09:36.342 --> 00:09:37.476
AND OTHER FACILITIES AND THAT

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.611

OPERATING MAY HAVE LAPS UNDER

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.316
TWO CONDITIONS.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.250
THAT THEY WERE ENTERED INTO A

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:46.452
HUGE IT YES BE CONTINUE ISSUES

A 50% POT WHICH IS THE STATEWIDE

00:25:58.556 --> 00:25:59.758
COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM THOSE

00:25:59.824 --> 00:26:01.326
PROJECTS ARE SELECTED BY THE

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.396
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:06.231
THERE'S A 40% PART OF MONEY.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.099
I THERE'S A 40% PART OF MONEY

00:26:08.166 --> 00:26:09.367
I'M FOR THE METROPOLITAN

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.703
PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS ARE NPOS

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.872
AND THEN 10% OF THE FUNDING IS

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:15.774
FOR PROJECTS IN THE SMALL URBAN

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.210
AND RURAL REGIONS OF THE STATE.

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:20.278
SO THAT'S THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:23.114
STRUCTURED SO IN OUR REVIEW OF

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.983
THE PROGRAM AND WE WERE ASKED TO

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.384
LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.486
HAVE BEEN FUNDED WHAT OUTCOMES

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:29.955
IN BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.

00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.690
SO IM IN TERMS OF PROJECTS

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.491
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN HUNDRED

00:26:33.558 --> 00:26:35.393
AND SEVENTY SIX PROJECTS TO DATE

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.761
PROGRAMMED INTO THE ACTIVE

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.063
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM.

00:26:38.129 --> 00:26:40.332
AND IT SEVENTY FIVE ABOUT 75% OF

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:41.499
THOSE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:43.101
PROJECTS SO THIS COULD BE

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.936
BUILDING A BIKE LANE IMPROVING A

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:46.705
SIDEWALK INSTALLING IT I'D

00:26:46.771 --> 00:26:47.939
TRAFFIC CROSSING PEDESTRIAN

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.975
CROSSING SIGNAL THOSE TYPES OF

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.609
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:52.711
I'M AND THE REMAINDER OF THE

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.579
PROJECTS TEND TO BE -- PLANNING

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.448
WORK AS WELL AS FINDING THAT

00:26:56.514 --> 00:26:57.449
WITH THE STATE'S ON ACTIVE

00:26:57.515 --> 00:26:58.950
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:03.421
CENTER WITHIN CALTRANS -- WHEN

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:04.255
WE LOOK AT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:06.224
THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED ACROSS THE

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:08.226
DIFFERENT -- COMPONENTS OF THE

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.261
PROGRAM THE STATEWIDE MPO AND

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.796
THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL.

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:13.331
AND THE TYPES OF PROJECTS BEING

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:14.833
FUNDED IN THESE DIFFERENT POTS

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:17.068
ARE ARE PRETTY SIMILAR AND WE'RE

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:17.702
SEEING A LOT OF THE SAME TYPES

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:19.070
OF PROJECTS THE SAME SORT OF

00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.272
DOLLAR AMOUNT DOLLAR VALUE OF

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:22.073
PROJECTS.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.575
ON AND SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:24.843
REALLY JUMPED OUT TO US FIVE

00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:26.544
SAYING WELL THIS COMPONENT THE

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.879
PROGRAM TENDS TO BE FINDING

00:27:27.946 --> 00:27:29.280
CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS OR

00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:31.049
MEETING CERTAIN GOALS.

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.818
AND THIS PROGRAMS READING

00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:34.452
SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO IT'S VERY

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.286
SIMILAR.

00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:36.054
I'M ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:37.088
KNOW IS THAT SINCE THE INCEPTION

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.590
OF THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECTS

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:39.891
ARE ALL THESE TEND TO BE VERY

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:41.993
SMALL DOLLAR VALUE PROJECTS THEM

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.395
IMPROVING A SIDEWALK OR PUTTING

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:44.629
IN A BIKE LANE IS.

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:45.730
A MUCH SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNT

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:46.931
THAN SOME OF OUR LARGER

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.266
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.401
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.069
BUT OVER TIME WE ARE SEEING THAT

00:27:51.136 --> 00:27:52.270
THESE PROJECTS HAVE GOTTEN

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:54.105
SOMEWHAT BIGGER IN TERMS OF THE

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.340
DOLLAR VALUE.

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:57.308
I'M AND IT THAT THAT WOULD ALL

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:58.843
BE EXPLAINED JUST BY SORT OF

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.211
RISING CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SO

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:01.880
IT DOES APPEAR THAT AS THE

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.481
PROGRAM IS IS BECOMING MORE

00:28:03.548 --> 00:28:05.150
ESTABLISH THAT.

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:07.018
PROJECT SPONSORS ARE MOVING I'M

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:09.254
MORE AND MORE TOWARDS A LARGER

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.289
PROJECT ONE OF THE GOALS WHEN

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.091
THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED.

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.793
AND WISE OR ONE OF THE THINGS

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.194
THAT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR WOULD BE

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.562
REALLY THESE LARGER MORE

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.497
TRANSFORMATIVE TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:21.132
WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING ENOUGH

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:23.168
OF A INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGE OR

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:25.036
IMPROVEMENT. TO REALLY ALLOW

00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:26.838
TRAVELS TRAVELERS TO HAVE A MOOD

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.540
SHIFT -- SO THAT THEY COULD TAKE

00:28:28.606 --> 00:28:30.341
SOME TRIPS NOT BY DRIVING BUT

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:32.710
INSTEAD BY WALKING OR BIKING AND

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.179
YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH OF A

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:35.180
SORT OF A NETWORK OF

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.781
IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CASES FOR

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:40.218
THAT TO ACTUALLY.

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:41.453
I'M BE WORKABLE FOR PEOPLE.

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:42.087
AND SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:42.854
PROGRAM COULD BE MOVING TOWARD

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.823
SOME OF THOSE LARGER PROJECTS.

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.224
AND THE OTHER THING WE'RE ASKED

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:47.926
TO LOOK AT IS AND BENEFITS OF

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:49.461
THE PROJECTS ARE OUTCOMES OF THE

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:51.129
PROGRAM HOW EFFECTIVE IS A AT

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.964
THAT MEETING AT SCHOOLS.

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:55.366
AND I'M WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.768
THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW CARE

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.103
ABOUT IS IS IT INCREASING

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.805
WALKING AND BIKING THAT'S THE

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:01.406
WHOLE POINT OF THE PROGRAM I'M

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:02.474
NOT WHAT.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.008
I TOLD POINT BY IN THE MAIN LINE

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:05.977
I'M AND WE DON'T KNOW -- THERE

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:07.045
AT THE DATA THAT'S BEEN

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:08.780
COLLECTED RIGHT NOW IS REALLY

00:29:08.847 --> 00:29:10.482
INSUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:12.951
US WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE AT THE

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.153
PROGRAM IN THAT REGARD.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.920
AND I WILL CARRY OUT THAT ALSO

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.589
WAS SAYING THAT I'M JUST GIVEN

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:18.590
THE TIMING AND THE RELATIVE

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:19.657
NEWNESS OF THIS PROGRAM IT'S

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:20.992
BEEN IN EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.427
BUT BECAUSE IT TAKES MANY YEARS

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:24.429
FOR PROJECT TO BE DESIGNED AND

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:26.164
CONSTRUCTED AND COMPLETED --

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.765
THERE HAVE ONLY JUST IN THIS

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.467
PAST YEAR BEEN THE FIRST ROUND

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:30.768
OF SORT OF PROJECT COMPLETION

00:29:30.835 --> 00:29:32.237
REPORTS THAT HAD BECOME

00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:33.771
AVAILABLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.440
SOMEWHAT LIMITED DATA SAID AND

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:36.574
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD.

00:29:36.641 --> 00:29:38.943
TIME LINE FOR YOU ALL TO BE

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.712
LOOKING AT IF THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:42.247
TWEAKS ARE CHANGES TO THE WAY

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:44.749
INFORMATION IS REPORTED BECAUSE

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:46.251
IT'S STILL RELATIVELY NEW SO

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:48.052
THERE WERE ABOUT. SIXTY FIVE

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.387
PROJECTS THAT HAVE REPORTED OUT

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.122
AT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:51.723
SEVENTY SIX THAT ARE COMPLETED

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.158
AND I'VE COME TO THE REPORTERS

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:57.996
THAT REPORTING.

00:29:58.062 --> 00:29:59.864
PART OF THAT THE PROGRAM.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.532
I'M IS SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:01.266
KNOW IF THE PROGRAM IS MAKING

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:03.168
MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS AND

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:03.635
WALKING AND BIKING.

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:04.969
AND EVEN IF YOU HAD THE YOU KNOW

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:06.538
ON THE STREETS THEY PUT DOWN

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:09.607
THOSE -- WIRES OR CORDS THE U.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:11.543
CARS GO OVER IN A COUNT HOW MANY

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:13.344
IT IS THE PET PEDESTRIANS WOULD

00:30:13.411 --> 00:30:14.245
JUST WALK OVER THAT THERE WOULD

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.980
BE LIKE A OKAY WALK OVER THIS I

00:30:16.047 --> 00:30:17.015
DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S THERE.

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:18.583
JUST GO AHEAD YEAH AND SAYS YOU

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.350
HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:19.918
RIGHT.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.853
WE DO AND IF IF I COULD JUST

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.621
BRIEFLY FINISH THERE THAT THE

00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:25.356
FINDING SO WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.891
LOOK AT WHETHER ONE OF THE GOALS

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:28.193
OF THE PROGRAM IS ARE PROJECTS

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:28.860
BENEFITING DISADVANTAGED

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:31.396
COMMUNITIES A MINIMUM OF 25% OF

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:32.830
THE FANS HAVE TO BENEFIT.

00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:34.332
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE

00:30:34.399 --> 00:30:35.533
PROGRAM DOES APPEAR TO BE

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.268
MEETING THATGOAL AND 88% OF THE

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:39.037
PROJECTS THAT WERE EITHER IN A

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:40.438
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OR WERE

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.406
OUTSIDE A DISADVANTAGED

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:47.245
COMMUNITY THAT HAD A BENEFIT. TO

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:48.846
A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY

00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:49.147
[inaudible]

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.949
BUT LIKEWISE.

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:51.749
IT MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT A

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:52.817
DISPENSED MANY BUT WE DON'T KNOW

00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:53.551
IF ANYBODY'S GETTING ON THEIR

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:54.619
BIKE OR THEY'RE WALKING AFTER

00:30:54.686 --> 00:30:55.253
IT'S BEEN BUILT BECAUSE THE DATA

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.254
IS.

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:59.123
PRESSING OKAY GOT IT.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.291
AND THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.559
WHETHER THERE'S BENEFITS TO THE

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.261
HIGHWAY SYSTEM THERE'S NO ON

00:31:03.328 --> 00:31:04.562
THESE TEND TO BE LOCAL PROJECTS

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:07.031
SO THERE'S NO SPECIFIC CARVE OUT

00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:07.665
FOR BENEFITING THE STATE HIGHWAY

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:08.533
SYSTEM.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.001
I'M AND THERE'S OTHER GOALS OF

00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:11.302
THE PROGRAM HAS I'M GHG

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:12.937
REDUCTIONS PUBLIC HEALTH

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:15.139
BENEFITS THOSE TEND TO SORT OF

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.342
BE TIED TO IF YOU'RE SEEING AN

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:18.643
INCREASE IN WALKING AND BIKING.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.011
I'M MORE YOU'E SEEING THA MODE

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.279
SHIFT AND SO AGAIN IT'S VERY

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:22.247
DIFFICULT TO TELL THOSE

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:23.982
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT ANY ACCURATE

00:31:24.048 --> 00:31:26.317
DATA ON ON THE WALKING AND

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:27.819
BIKING.

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:28.453
AND IF WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.121
LOOK AT YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:32.890
IT CHALLENGES AND AND AND MAKE

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.592
RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPROVING THE

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.293
PROGRAM.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.761
IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:39.030
CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:40.565
THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET UP AT

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:41.666
LEAST IN THIS LAST SPENDING

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:44.202
CYCLE IS WHY YOU HAVE THESE FOUR

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.036
POTS OF MONEY.

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:47.438
AND YOU HAVE A AND P. O. COULD

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:49.641
CHOOSE AND PRIORITIZE OUR OWN

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:50.241
PROJECT WITHIN THEIR PART OF

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:50.975
MANY.

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.510
THEY ARE LIMITED TO THE PROJECTS

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.612
THAT OUR FIRST COMPETED IN THE

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:55.947
STATEWIDE COMPETITION.

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:57.048
AND THEN THE PROJECTS THAT DON'T

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:58.716
GET FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE

00:31:58.783 --> 00:31:59.951
WIDE PORTION OF THE PROGRAM.

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:01.419
GET SENT DOWN BASICALLY TO THE

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:03.955
I'M PL IS FOR THEM TO CHOOSE AND

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:07.225
SO BECAUSE THERE IS AND IN SOME

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:08.259
PROJECT SPONSORS ARE HIRING

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:10.028
CONSULTANTS TO HELP THEM GET

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:12.363
THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.299
IT CAN BE I AND I IN OTHER SOME

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:15.366
WORKLOAD THAT GOES ALONG WITH

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:16.868
APPLYING GO INTO THAT.

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.102
CTC PROCESS EVIDENTLY IT'S A

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:20.004
DIFFICULT APPLICATION PROCESS TO

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.506
GET THROUGH.

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.674
OUR YEAH I THINK WE HAVE.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.442
YEAH WE HAD HEARD THAT FROM A

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:25.310
FROM SOME OF THE PROJECT

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:27.045
SPONSORS THAT WE TALKED TO I

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.246
THINK THE CDC HAS TRIED TO

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.681
RESPOND BY CREATING.

00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:30.848
MORE STREAMLINED VERSIONS OF

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:32.250
APPLICATIONS FOR SMALLER

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.718
PROJECTS BUT THERE IS STILL

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:34.485
DEFINITELY LIKE AN

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.753
ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD THAT

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.021
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.623
AND SO THAT COULD SORT OF SCARE

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.991
OFF SOME PROJECT SPONSORS MAYBE

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:41.492
OR IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT TO

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.161
THEM TO APPLY TO YOU COULD BE

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:45.029
HAVING A SITUATION WHERE.

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.698
THE NPOS ARE BEING SORT OF

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.533
ARTIFICIALLY LIMITED AND NOT

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:49.834
ABLE TO PICK THE PROJECTS THAT

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:51.235
ARE THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:52.470
BECAUSE THEY'RE LIMITED TO THE

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:59.110
PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.244
THE STATEWIDE COMPETITION.

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:00.812
SO IN TERMS OF OUR

00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:02.146
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE OBVIOUS

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:02.980
ONE IS MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:03.581
COLLECTING THE DATA -- YOU'RE

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:04.182
GONNA WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:04.716
THIS PROGRAM IS INCREASING

00:33:04.782 --> 00:33:06.584
WALKING AND BIKING TO UNDERSTAND

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.586
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:10.688
I'M GOING FORWARD. ONE OF THE

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.257
THINGS TO BE MINDFUL OF IS TO

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:14.826
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WALKING

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:15.626
AND BIKING INCREASE YOU HAVE TO

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:17.428
DO SORT OF COUNTS GO OUT BEFORE

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.397
THE PROJECT AND HOW MANY PEOPLE

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:20.798
ARE WALKING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

00:33:20.865 --> 00:33:22.200
BIKING AND LIKE YOU SAID MISTER

00:33:22.266 --> 00:33:23.401
CHAIR YOU CAN'T JUST BUT WHEN.

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:24.035
OTHER STRIPS DOWN INTO ACCOUNT

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:26.204
SO THERE'S OTHER METHODOLOGIES

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.139
FOR DOING IT -- BUT THAT CAN BE

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:29.607
EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.075
TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:32.310
PROJECT TO MAKE VERY SMALL

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.244
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:34.345
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:33:34.412 --> 00:33:35.680
WHICH PROJECTS DOES IT MAKE THE

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.048
MOST SENSE SIGN MAYBE IT'S THE

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:38.883
BIGGER PROJECTS MAYBE AT CERTAIN

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.118
TYPES OF PROJECTS.

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:41.786
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT JOB

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.721
DOESN'T IT FOR THE SUMMER TO SIT

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:47.492
THERE WITH THE TICKER KICKING

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:54.766
QUE QUE COUNT ON THEN YOUR FINAL

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:55.166
THOUGH AND THEN.

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:58.102
THE LAST TWO RECOMMENDATIONS SO.

00:33:58.169 --> 00:33:58.736
CONSIDER WHAT THE ROLE OF THE

00:33:58.803 --> 00:33:59.904
STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:01.506
PROGRAM IS SO WHEN WHEN THIS IS

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.174
CREATED THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:05.076
MORE HIGHLIGHT MORE IMPORTANT

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.677
SIGN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION.

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:07.745
AND GIVE THE STATE A ROLE IN

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:10.014
SETTING PRIORITIES AND SELECTING

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:10.982
PROJECTS.

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:13.084
AND THESE TEND OTHERWISE WOULD

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.519
BE VERY LOCAL PROJECTS THAT

00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:15.653
WOULD BE DETERMINE WHAT THE

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:17.422
PRIORITY IS AT A LOCAL OR

00:34:17.488 --> 00:34:18.589
REGIONAL LEVEL.

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:21.159
AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:23.594
STATE MAKING THAT THAT PRIORITY

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:25.129
SETTING ARE PROJECTS SELECTION

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:27.532
THE SETTING AND HAVING NOT ROLL

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:28.833
THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.735
MOST SENSE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:32.236
SELECTED AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:33.237
SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT A HER

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:35.473
THOUGHT IS HAVING THESE LARGER

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.842
MORE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.110
WHERE YOU MAY BE REALLY BUILDING

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:40.978
OUT A NETWORK OF BIKE LANES OR

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:42.613
MAKING ENOUGH IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.682
YOU WOULD SEE AS SIGNIFICANT

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:45.817
MODE SHIFT.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:47.418
THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND WE

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:49.487
TEND TO BE A REALLY GOOD FIT FOR

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:50.922
THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT.

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.457
OF THE PROGRAM AND IT MAKES

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:53.991
SENSE BECAUSE A LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:56.127
MAYBE A CITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:58.029
PULL TOGETHER ENOUGH FUNDING TO

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.697
DO THAT TYPE OF A PROJECT ON

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.232
THEIR OWN AND SO IT IT MAKES

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:02.366
SENSE THAT THE STATE WOULD COME

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:04.001
IN AND HAVE A PROGRAM FOR DOING

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:04.435
THOSE.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.671
TYPES OF PROJECTS I'M YOU MAY

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:07.438
HAVE OTHER GOALS THAT YOU WANT

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:09.607
THAT -- COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM

00:35:09.674 --> 00:35:11.676
TO ACHIEVE -- YOU MAY WANT TO

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:12.643
THINK ABOUT THE HAVING THE

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.778
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ACHIEVE

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.446
DIFFERENT GOALS HAVING THREE

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.647
COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.649
WITH AND DIFFERENT GROUPS

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.151
SELECTING THE PROJECTS BUT

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:20.818
THEY'RE ALL KIND OF MEETING THE

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:21.752
SAME GOALS AND THEY'RE ALL

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.421
TRYING TO SEX SELECT THE SAME

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.188
PROJECTS.

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.089
GOING TO BEG THE QUESTION OF

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.591
WHAT DO YOU GETTING OUT OF THE

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:29.193
STATE HAVING THIS OVERALL ROLE

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.495
IN IT IF WE'RE JUST PICKING.

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:31.462
MUCH OF THE SAME TYPES OF

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.264
PROJECTS WE WOULD PICK ANYWAYS

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.066
IF YOU JUST YOU KNOW LET THAT

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:37.034
THE REGION'S AND LOCAL AGENCIES

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.236
SELECT THE PROJECTS.

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:43.474
AND AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO THINK

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:44.675
ABOUT.

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:45.676
I'M IN A SETTING DIFFERENT GOALS

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:46.878
RE FRAMING THE STATEWIDE

00:35:46.944 --> 00:35:47.745
COMPONENT AND AS YOU DO THAT

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:48.379
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ALSO NEED

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:49.614
TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF HOW THE

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.948
PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED.

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:52.049
I'M RIGHT NOW HAVING EVERYTHING

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:54.151
FLOW THROUGH CTC WITH THE WAY

00:35:54.218 --> 00:35:54.852
THE PROGRAM SET UP KIND OF MAKES

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.288
SENSE -- BUT IF YOU'RE CHANGING

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:57.955
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT

00:35:58.022 --> 00:36:00.124
EVERYBODY HAVE TO APPLY FOR IT

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.026
THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM FIRST.

00:36:02.093 --> 00:36:03.794
IF THERE REALLY IS A DIFFERENT

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.563
KIND OF PROJECT A REGION YEAH

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.130
THE THE EIGHTY SO IF YOU'RE

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:06.998
GONNA WANT TO THINK THROUGH THAT

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.799
THE ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:09.367
ON THE PROGRAM AS YOU THINK

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:10.101
THROUGH THAT.

00:36:10.167 --> 00:36:14.105
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE STATE

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:15.573
STREAMLINED THE PROCESS.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.774
SO THAT THE THE LOCAL PEOPLE GET

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:17.642
TO HAVE THE MONEY IN WILL BE

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.510
ABLE TO COMPETE AT THE OLD THE

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:20.811
REGIONAL LEVEL YEAH SO THAT'S

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:22.179
OUR LAST RECOMMENDATION IS

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.381
CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:25.650
FLEXIBILITY IS TO THE M. PO'S.

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:26.851
SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LIMITED TO

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:28.019
THIS POOL OF PROJECTS IT DIDN'T

00:36:28.085 --> 00:36:29.153
GET FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.355
RIGHT COMPETITION SO WE THINK AT

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.356
A MINIMUM MAYBE LIKE OPEN THAT

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.425
UP ON AND PROVIDE MORE

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:35.960
FLEXIBILITY THERE SO THAT.

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.395
THERE'S NOT PROJECTS THAT MIGHT

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:39.096
BE A HIGH LOCAL PRIORITY THE END

00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:40.264
UP GETTING EXCLUDED FROM

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.533
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.135
I'M AND YOU COULD MAKE A CHANGE

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:45.703
AS SIMPLE AS THAT WERE YOU COULD

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.438
DO MORE WERE YOU INSTEAD OF

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:49.440
HAVING AND RIGHT NOW WE TALKED

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:50.741
IN THE LAST SAME ABOUT SORT OF

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:52.043
PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT IN THE

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:54.211
C. T. C. ALLOCATING FUNDING BY

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.780
PHASE OF A PROJECT -- THERE

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.315
DOING THAT FOR ALL OF THESE

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.616
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS --

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.885
YOU COULD MOVE AWAY FROM THAT

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.720
AND YOU COULD MOVE TO MORE OF

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:04.589
YOU KNOW SORT OF A BLOCK GRANT

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:07.091
TYPE APPROACH AND HAVE AND OTHER

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:08.859
TYPES OF REPORTING THAT YOU HAVE

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.928
THE NPOS REPORT BACK OR EVEN THE

00:37:10.995 --> 00:37:12.496
SMALLER REGIONS REPORT BACK TO

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.265
THE STATE ON HOW THE FUNDS WERE.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:15.766
SPENT BUT WE DO THINK GIVING

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.501
THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY AND AND AT

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:18.970
LEAST SOME WAY IS SOMETHING THAT

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:20.605
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO CONSIDER

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:23.207
AND AGAIN AS YOU THINK ABOUT

00:37:23.274 --> 00:37:25.443
CHANGING THAT THE REGIONAL POT

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:26.711
OF MONEY IN THE STATE PART OF

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:28.279
MANY AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:32.583
IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW THE PROGRAM.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:33.951
IS JUST.

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:34.418
TURN OVER ALL.

IMPROVED -- IN ADDITION WE

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:50.961
LOOKED AT THE THE DATA THE

DURING THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:08.913
CYCLES -- BECAUSE I WANTED TO

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.915
GET MORE -- UNDERSTANDING OF HOW

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:13.551
THE PROGRAM WAS WORKING SO I WAS.

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:14.018
BASING AYE.

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.419

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:20.491
SENATE EMPLOYEE WITH HANDS ON

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:23.294
KNOWLEDGE STILL VERY GOOD -- ARE

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.795
KEY FINDINGS -- NUMBER ONE THE

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.163
PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY POPULAR

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.965
IT'S VERY MUCH OVERSUBSCRIBED

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.533
LOTS MORE REQUEST FOR FUNDING

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.302
THAT IS AVAILABLE -- AND A

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:32.903
HIGHLY ENGAGE STAKEHOLDER GROUP

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.573
THERE IS A LOT OF PARTICIPATION

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.241
A LOT OF UP.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:37.875
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE A HANDS

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:40.945
ON IMPACT ON THE PROCESS.

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:41.712
AMONG THE STATE BECAUSE WE

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.447
TALKED TO A VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:45.850
SUPPORTS THE COMPETITIVE NATURE

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.251
OF THE PROGRAM NOBODY WANTED.

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.019
TO BASICALLY JUST ALLOCATE THE

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:51.288
FUNDING STRICTLY BY FORMULA AND

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:53.891
NOT HAVE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS --

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:54.892
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT DOES

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.660
ALLOW US TO FIND THE BEST

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.562
PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:00.464
THEY ARE IN THE STATE -- IT

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:02.633
ALLOWS SMALL COMMUNITIES TO

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.769
PUNCH ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT -- TO

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.036
GET MORE FUNDING THAN THEY MIGHT

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.671
UNDER HAVE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.607
ON THEIR EVEN SEVERAL YEARS OF A

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.609
A FORMULA ALLOCATION -- AND SOME

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:13.310
PEOPLE ALSO SAID THAT THE STATE

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:14.311
WIDE.

00:40:14.378 --> 00:40:15.813
STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT OF THE

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.282
PROGRAM -- REDUCES LOCAL.

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:21.318
LOCAL POLITICS AND IN THEIR VIEW --

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:23.087
RESULTS IN MORE OBJECTIVE REVIEW

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:27.625
OF OF THE PROJECT BENEFITS -- WE

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:28.192
DID ALSO HEAR FROM A LOT OF

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.493
STAKEHOLDERS THAT -- THE

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.295
APPLICATION PROCESS IS VERY

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.797
COSTS AND LABOR.

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.965
INTENSIVE ONE OF THE MOST --

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:36.333
COST LABOR INTENSIVE

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.902
APPLICATIONS THEY DO SEVERAL

00:40:37.968 --> 00:40:42.940
SEVERAL APPLICANTS TOLD US THAT --

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:43.541
IN PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:44.909
IS THAT.

00:40:44.975 --> 00:40:46.410
THE CDC IS TRYING TO GATHER A

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:49.346
LOT OF DATA -- TO UNDERSTAND

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.214
WHAT THE PROJECTS ARE

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:51.148
ACCOMPLISHING AS WELL AS A

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.583
NARRATIVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.818
THIS PROJECT REALLY TRYING TO DO

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:55.119
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS.

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:57.254
INCREASE WALKING AND BIKING IT'S

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.689
NOT NECESSARILY WITHOUT A

00:40:58.756 --> 00:40:59.957
COMPELLING NARRATIVE IT'S NOT

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:00.991
NECESSARILY CLEAR.

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:01.926
HOW THESE PARTICULAR

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:02.560
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.228
GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE WANTING THEM

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.963
TO DO SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.500
THAT GOES INTO IT -- AND BUT

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.835
THAT THAT WE RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:12.269
BECAUSE WE NEED THAT FOR DOING

00:41:12.336 --> 00:41:15.372
PROJECT EVALUATION -- BUT THAT

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.074
IS A CHALLENGE.

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.742
SOME OF THE OUR VERTICALLY THE

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:20.110
REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TOLD US

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.545
THAT -- THE CHALLENGES THE

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.747
STATEWIDE HALF OF THE PROGRAM IN

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:25.182
PARTICULAR DOESN'T.

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.584
CONSIDER THEIR REGIONAL

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.354
PRIORITIES EVERY -- MPO -- EVERY

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:32.189
VETERINARIAN THE STATE HAS OUR

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:34.325
GOALS AND PLANS THAT THEY HAVE

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.459
TO INFLUENCE TO STABLE COMMUNITY

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.861
STRATEGIES CONGESTION MEDICATION

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:37.895
AIR QUALITY LOTS OF DIFFERENT

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:38.929
THINGS THAT.

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:41.365
WE EXPECT THEM TO DELIVER ON BUT

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:42.800
WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THAT THIS

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.134
STATEWIDE WHICHEVER HALF MONEY

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.436
THIS PROGRAM COMES FROM.

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:46.570
DOESN'T.

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.972
NECESSARILY TAKE IN THE

00:41:48.038 --> 00:41:50.040
CONSIDERATION WHICH PROJECTS ARE.

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.942
ARE GOING TO HELP THE REGION'S

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:54.044
MEET THOSE GOALS -- SO THAT'S A

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.613
CHALLENGE FOR THEM THEY THEY GET

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:56.814
WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE THE

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.249
STATEWIDE COMPETITION BUT IT MAY

00:41:58.315 --> 00:41:59.683
OR MAY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:01.819
MOVES THE NEEDLE -- THERE ALSO

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.287
SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.356
SELECTION PROCESS VERY COMPLEX

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.757
REFLECTION PROCESS.

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.492
LOTS OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:09.727
PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:42:09.793 --> 00:42:11.795
SUBMITTED -- AND TO WHETHER THAT

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:15.199
PROCESS IS ABLE TO REALLY SELECT.

00:42:15.266 --> 00:42:16.467
THE BEST PROJECTS THE AS I SAID

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:17.868
THE COMPANY THE PREMISE OF THE

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.236
PROGRAM IS WE SHOULD BE FINDING

00:42:19.303 --> 00:42:20.971
THE BEST PROJECTS WHEREVER THEY

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.606
ARE IN THE STATE -- BUT UNDER

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.541
THE STATE'S SELECTION PROCESS

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:29.680
THERE ARE. TWO REVIEWERS THAT

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:33.050
LOOK AT EACH PARTICULAR PROJECT

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:33.651
AND THOSE ARE HERE THEY COME

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:34.685
FROM A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERTISE

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:35.319
YOU MAY HAVE ENGINEERS YU MAY

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.553
HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.022
ADVOCATES A WIDE RANGE OF OF

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.056
FOLKS BRING THEIR PERSPECTIVE --

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:40.491
AND THOUGH THE GROUP THE

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.026
COMMISSION HAS PUT TOGETHER A

00:42:42.092 --> 00:42:43.460
VERY ROBUST RUBRIC.

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:47.398
THERE IS STILL OBVIOUSLY A A

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:48.899
ROOM FOR SUBJECTIVITY ANYTIME

00:42:48.966 --> 00:42:50.701
YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE COMING

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:51.769
FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WE

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.237
HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S SO

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.039
COMPETITIVE THE ONE POINT.

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:57.608
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- IN

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.109
MANY CASES BEING FUNDED OR NOT --

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.244
IF.

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:01.445
YOU HAVE A REVIEWERTHAT LOOKS

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.113
AT IT AND IS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.982
GENEROUS REVIEWER MAYBE COMES AT

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:07.418
IT FROM A DIFFERENT -- EMPHASIS

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:08.686
AND YOU DON'T HAVE.

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:09.620
SOMEONE SORT OF BALANCING THAT

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.655
OUT FROM A WIDE RANGE OF OF

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.157
EXPERTISE.

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.358
YOU CAN GET SOME SOME VERY

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:15.759
ABILITY OR SAID SOMETHING IF I

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:20.130
AM VERY ABILITY THAT WE THINK

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:20.331
MIGHT.

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:21.332
MIGHT IN.

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.599
INFLUENCE WHY SOME PROJECTS.

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.600
SCORE HIGHER THAN OTHER VERY

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.235
SIMILAR PROJECTS SO -- THAT'S A

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:25.903
CHALLENGE WITH THE WAY THAT THE

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:28.605
PROJECT WITH THE PROCESSES.

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:30.908
IS STRUCTURED.

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:33.377
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE DATA --

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.945
WE DID FIND THAT MOST AT LEAST

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:37.014
AMONG THE 40% THAT GOES TO THE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.048
THE LARGE NPOS I DO WANT TO

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.783
CLARIFY ONE THING THAT LA --

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.186
SAID -- DIRECTLY EIGHTEEN M. P.

00:43:42.252 --> 00:43:44.955
O.'S IN THE STATE THE THE 40%

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:48.292
SHARE IS THOSE TEN NPOS.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:51.628
THAT -- ARE OF TWO HUNDRED

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:52.029
THOUSAND OR MORE.

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.230
THERE'S EIGHT OTHER NPOS THAT

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.264
ARE SMALLER.

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.900
THEY ARE CAPTURED IN THE 10% OF

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.902
RURAL AND SMALL URBAN COMPONENT

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.170
OF THE PROGRAM.

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.705
THEY DO HOWEVER.

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.140
HAVE.

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.242
SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND OTHER

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.844
OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT THE

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.078
LARGE ONES TO AS WELL TALK ABOUT

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:11.048
THAT LATER -- BUT AMONG THE

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:13.450
LARGE POS MOST OF THE TEN OF

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.219
THIS TEN SEVEN OF THEM DID

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:16.687
RECEIVE A SHARE OF THE OVERALL

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.355
STATE POT OVER THE LIFE OF THE

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:19.023
PROGRAM.

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:21.825
THAT'S COMMENSURATE ROUGHLY WITH

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:23.560
THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION OF

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:24.895
THERE WERE.

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.697
THREE AREAS THAT HAVE HAVE

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:29.299
UNDERPERFORMED AND I DIDN'T DIG

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.701
INTO.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:31.535
DEPTH INTO SPECIFICALLY WHAT

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.003
WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE IN THE FOR

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.840
THE FACTORS THAT THAT'S A MATTER --

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.709
FOR FOR SITUATION BUT THREE OF

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:39.276
THEM DID SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.979
PERFORMED -- WELL THE SMALLER

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.680
MINERAL -- AND THESE HAVE AS A

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.616
COLLECTIVE -- PERFORM PRETTY

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:46.984
WELL THEY REPRESENT 8% OF

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.219
POPULATION BUT ABOUT 13% OF THE

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:51.321
PROJECT FUNDING. TO THAT'S GOOD

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:53.891
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT -- A LOT

00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:56.160
OF THAT FUNDING GOES TO JUST TWO

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.961
OR THREE OF THE REGIONS AND A

00:44:58.028 --> 00:44:59.863
COUPLE OF THE OF THE SMALLER HER

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.265
DOING VERY WELL BUT THERE'S A

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.766
LOT OF FOLKS WHO AREN'T SO

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:03.434
THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.368
MIND.

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.536
AS WE LOOK AT HOW WELL THE

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:07.237
PROGRAM IS IS IN IS THAT BECAUSE

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:08.539
A LOT OF THE WEATHER SMALL

00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:10.074
PROJECTS IT JUST.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.708
COSTS SO MUCH MONEY ON THAT AND

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:12.843
AND THE SMALLER PROJECTS MEAN

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.013
WHEN YOU SAY IT'S 13% OF THE PIE.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.448
AND IT'S ONLY PERCENT POPULATION

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.049
I SORT OF THINK IT'S IT'S OKAY

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:23.887
BY I GUESS IT'S RURAL SO IT'S

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:26.290
SPREAD OUT AND SURE THAT'S THE

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:26.990
THAT'S THE EIGHT SMALLER NPOS

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.025
AND ALL OF THE RULES TOGETHER I

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.326
THINK IT'S ABOUT THOSE REGIONS

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:29.793
HAVE.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.694
GOT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:33.797
DOLLARS OVER THE FOUR CYCLES IN --

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.966
IN STATE FUNDING IT THEY WOULD

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:36.600
HAVE GOTTEN IF YOU DID IT BY A

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:37.267
STRICT.

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:39.770
POPULATION MODEL THEY WOULD HAVE.

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:41.071
GOTTEN.

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.439
THAT THAT THAT PART OF THE THOSE

00:45:42.506 --> 00:45:43.507
AND THESE COLLECTIVELY WITH

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.842
ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION NOW HOW

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:45.776
THAT GOT.

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:46.910
DISTRIBUTED IN PARTICULAR

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:49.179
PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW AND ARE

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.481
THERE MORE.

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:53.684
RURAL PROJECTS IN JUST IN BALK

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.018
NUMBER BECAUSE YOU JUST WARY

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.954
ATTEND THE URBAN AND SUBURBAN

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.388
PROJECTS OR IS THAT.

00:45:58.455 --> 00:45:59.323
IS THAT'S NOT IT REALLY I

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:01.024
HONESTLY HAVEN'T LOOKED AT OKAY

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.960
WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT YOU KNOW

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:05.262
HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN IN TERMS OF

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:08.265
CONTINUE.

00:46:08.332 --> 00:46:09.733
AND IF YOU DO A JURISDICTIONS

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.536
DID PARTICULARLY WELL -- FOR

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.103
WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:13.871
THEY'VE.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:15.506
GOT VERTICALLY GOOD AT AT YOU

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.840
KNOW WORKING AT THIS AT THIS

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.276
PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:46:19.343 --> 00:46:21.278
REGIONS ARE BEING -- YOU KNOW

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:22.279
THERE HAVE NOT PERFORMED ALL

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:23.213
THAT WELL SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.648
FACTOR TO CONSIDER.

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:25.649
ANOTHER THING WHEN LOOKING AT

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.017
THE DATA AND THIS WAS ALREADY

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:29.686
REFERENCE BY -- THE LA OVER THE

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.421
AVERAGE PROJECTS SIZE BOTH OF

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:33.157
SUBMITTED PROJECT APPLICATIONS

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:35.926
AND THOSE AWARDED HAS.

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:36.927
GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY IN

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.629
PREDICAMENT CYCLE THREE TO CYCLE

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:39.563
FOR IT DOUBLED FROM AN AVERAGE

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.732
PROJECT SIZE ABOUT TWO POINT

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:42.699
THREE TO FOUR POINT SIX MILLION

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:42.866
SO.

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:45.269
A PART OF THAT IS CERTAINLY THE

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:46.403
COMMISSION HAS.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.438
A AS A POLICY MATTER OF SAID

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:49.873
THEY WANT TO FIND MORE

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.809
TRANSFORMATIONAL PROJECTS BUT

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:54.144
AND THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:56.713
POLICY GOAL TO CONSIDER -- GIVEN

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.848
THE CURRENT FUNDING IT HAS

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.183
CAUSED A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN THE

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:00.851
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.085
ABLE TO FIND AND THAT'S JUST A

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.153
DURING YOUR RESEARCH WAS THAT

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:07.191
BECAUSE LET'S SAY IT'S A SMALL

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:08.358
PROJECT.

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.793
INSTEAD OF DOING FOUR MILES OF

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:11.929
BIKE PATHS ARE DOING FIVE MILES

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.264
TO BY PASS CYLINDER SMALL.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:15.232
I SIZE OR IS IT BECAUSE ONE MILE

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:16.867
OF BIKE PATH COSTS MORE MONEY

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:21.238
THAN IT DID. FOUR YEARS AGO.

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:21.838
WHERE DID I GET NOW INTO THAT

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:22.706
LEVEL OF GRANULARITY BUT I WOULD

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:25.309
SAY OVER TO A TWO YEARS OF SUCH

00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:25.943
CYCLE TO SEE?

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.444
THE A DOUBLING OF THE PROJECT

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.779
SIZE IS PROBABLY CAN'T BE.

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:32.216
ACCOUNTED FOR BY SIMPLY -- THAT

00:47:32.282 --> 00:47:33.951
BUT MAYBE MAYBE THE COMMISSION

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.752
HAS DONE MORE.

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.587
DIGGING INTO THIS WE GET TO THAT

00:47:36.653 --> 00:47:36.987
LATER.

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:37.821
I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETELY

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:43.026
EXPLAINED BY JUST INCREASING

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:44.461
CONSTRUCTION COSTA OKAY.

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.163
HI CONTINUE SO.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:49.866
SO ANYWAY TO OUR OUR SUGGESTIONS --

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:50.534
AND I WOULD SAY I THINK THE LA --

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:51.668
SAID WE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WE

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.070
WERE LOOKING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:53.637
THINGS WE DON'T NECESSARILY

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:54.938
DISAGREE.

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.306
WITH THEIR SUGGESTIONS AND

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:58.976
RECOMMENDATIONS EITHER -- A LOT

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.978
OF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT POLICY

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:03.313
OBJECTIVES YOU WANT TO ADDRESS --

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.549
ONE THING WE SUGGEST IS OF

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.150
INCREASING THE SHARE OF THE

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.852
FUNDING THAT GOES TO THAT LARGE

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:10.988
NPO COMPONENT CURRENTLY IT'S 40%

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.756
OF THE TOTAL BY -- BUT THE SAME

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:13.924
TIME.

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:16.593
EXCLUDING THEM FROM THE THE

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.728
STATE WIDE PORTIONS OF

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:18.629
ESSENTIALLY THE STATEWIDE

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:20.731
COMPONENT WOULD BECOME SOMETHING

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:21.865
FOR THE RURAL REGIONS IN THIS

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:22.966
AND THE SMALLER REGIONS OF THE

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.434
COMMISSION WOULD WOULD.

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.169
OVERSEE -- THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.771
A COUPLE OF COULD ACCOMPLISH A

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:30.474
COUPLE OF THINGS -- THE REASONS

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.675
AGAIN HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:32.876
IN THIS WOULD GIVE THEM MORE OF

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:36.213
A TOOL TO TO ADDRESS THE ADDRESS

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.547
THEIR GOALS -- IT WOULD ALSO

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:39.716
ADDRESS THE REGIONAL EQUITY

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.318
QUESTION TO THE BECAUSE IT WOULD

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:42.853
ENSURE THAT EACH.

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:45.055
OF THE LARGE REGIONS WAS GETTING

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.456
THEIR REPORT PROPORTIONATE SHARE

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:50.994
WHILE THERE WOULD STILL BE A

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.663
COMPETITION WITHIN THE REGION --

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:55.899
AND YOU WOULD HAVE REVIEWERS.

00:48:55.966 --> 00:48:56.533
WITH GREATER FOR WHO HAD GREATER

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.934
PRESUMABLY GREATER FAMILIARITY

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.535
WITH THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:58.835
THEN MIGHT.

00:48:58.902 --> 00:48:59.736
BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:00.804
THAN THE STATEWIDE REVIEWER WHO

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:02.339
MAY NOT.

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:03.774
HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.575
THE PARTICULARS OF THE ISSUES IN

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:06.677
THE REGION ARE IN IT WOULD

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:08.278
PRESUMABLY HELP THAT MEET THOSE

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:10.314
REGIONAL PRIORITIES THEY UPSET

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.782
BUT THAT NORTE MIGHT HAVE MORE

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:12.983
SENSITIVITY TO WILL HOW THE

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.017
REGION ITSELF WAS TRYING TO

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.652
ACCOMPLISH REGION PRIORITIES AND

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:16.720
HOW THE PROJECTS.

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:20.590
THAT WERE BEING PROPOSED FIT

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:22.926
INTO THAT OVERALL REGIONAL PLAN.

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:24.294
SO AND EIGHTY A SIDE EFFECT OF

00:49:24.361 --> 00:49:24.828
THIS WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY A

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:25.629
SMALLER POOL OF PROJECTS THAT

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.097
THE COMMISSION WOULD BE MANAGING

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.433
STATEWIDE -- AND SO THAT LEADS

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.234
INTO OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.803
WHICH IS THAT IF THE COMMISSION

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.137
HAD A SMALLER.

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.372
POOL OF PROJECTS -- THEY COULD

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.274
POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE SIZE OF

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.676
THEIR REVIEW TEAMS THERE WAS A

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.011
FRANK TO EARLIER YOU HAVE.

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:42.946
OF ONLY TWO REVIEWERS SO YOU MAY

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:44.247
NOT HAVE THE FULL RANGE OF

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.149
EXPERTISE -- LOOKING AT EVERY

00:49:46.216 --> 00:49:48.752
PROJECT THIS MIGHT ALLOW THEM TO

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:49.519
HAVE A FIVE OR SIX MEMBER

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:51.054
REACHING THAT WAS LOOKING AT

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:53.290
EACH PROJECT WHICH WOULD MAYBE --

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:56.827
LIMIT LIMIT SOME OF THAT

00:49:56.893 --> 00:49:58.195
SUBJECTIVISM -- YOU MIGHT ALSO

00:49:58.261 --> 00:49:59.229
BE ABLE TO HAVE.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.063
AT LEAST ONE OR TWO THE M. P.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.698
O.'S AT THE REGIONAL PROCESS HAS

00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:03.767
A A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE THEY

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.235
HAVE REVIEW TEAM TO LOOK AT EACH

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:06.336
PROJECTS IN THE TOP.

00:50:06.403 --> 00:50:08.705
GOING ONES GET ELEVATED TO THE

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:09.473
TO HAVE.

REVIEWS EVERY APPLICATION.

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:54.424
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.893
NORMALIZE THE SCORING AND TO THE

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.862

00:56:55.678 --> 00:57:01.384
BE IT IS EUIPMENT WILL BE ABLE

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:02.285
TO BE CHECKED OUT.

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:02.952
BY AGENCIES THROUGHOUT

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.354
CALIFORNIA TO UTILIZE FOR THEIR

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.355
BEFORE AND AFTER COUNTS SO WE

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:06.756
BELIEVE THAT SHOULD GREATLY HELP --

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:08.625
WHERE WHERE BLOCKING DATA AT

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.894
THIS POINT IN TIME?

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.929
I DO WE DID ONE ADDRESS THE

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:15.064
REASON WHY WE HAVE IT --

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.900
REQUIRED THE NPOS ARE THE

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:19.235
PROJECTS TO COMPETE IN THE STATE

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:21.671
Y. COMPONENT BEFORE THEY WERE

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:23.206
ELIGIBLE FOR THE MPO COMPONENT.

00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.274
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THIS WAS

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.942
A BRAND NEW REQUIREMENT IN THE

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.777
FOURTH CYCLE.

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:30.280
OF THE REASON FOR THAT WAS IT WE

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:32.115
WERE WE WERE STRAIGHT WE WERE

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:33.650
STRIVING TO ACHIEVE.

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:36.085
BETTER STATEWIDE DATA COLLECTION.

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:37.220
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.555
REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THIS

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:41.124
PROGRAM. TO THE PUBLIC INTO THE

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.759
LEGISLATURE IN OTHERS BUT IN

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:44.427
LIGHT OF THESE REPORTS WE WILL

00:57:44.494 --> 00:57:46.863
GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:48.698
AND LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE MEANS

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:52.335
TO CUT THAT COLLECT BETTER

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:53.570
STATEWIDE DATA.

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:55.605
WITH REGARDS TO THE TRANSFORM

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:58.408
INTO PROJECTS -- WE ARE YOU KNOW

00:57:58.474 --> 00:58:00.143
THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:00.710
KNOW IT'S A TRANSFORM INTO

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:01.945
PROJECT.

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.279
AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS

00:58:03.346 --> 00:58:04.681
WHERE IN THE PAST YOU MIGHT OF

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:06.015
BEEN SINGLE COMPONENTS BROUGHT

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:07.116
FORWARD BUT THERE IT.

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.718
THERE ARE ENTITIES IN THE STATE

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:09.252
THAT ARE PUTTING TOGETHER

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.920
NETWORKS THEY'RE PUTTING

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.455
TOGETHER CLOSING GAPS CREATING A

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:14.157
LARGE NETWORK AND SO THE

00:58:14.224 --> 00:58:16.259
COMMISSION IS IS AGREES WE AGREE

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.694
WITH THE LA US REPORT IN THIS IN

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.429
OFFICE RESEARCH THAT THOSE

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.797
PROJECTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:22.298
IN THE COMMISSION THIS LAST

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:23.833
CYCLE ENCOURAGED THOSE TYPES

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.868
APPROACH PROJECTS TO COME

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:26.603
FORWARD AND SO WE DID SEE AN

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.605
INCREASE IN THE APPLICATIONS FOR

00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:33.610
THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS -- WE I

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.978
GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:35.945
IN A DAY AND THE CHRISTIANS

00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.480
FUNDED MORE THOSE PROJECTS A

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:38.615
CYCLE.

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:41.184
BUT THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE PROGRAM.

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.219
HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTED TO

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:44.687
TRANSFORM INTO PROJECTS.

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:45.588
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.457
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.691
SMALL URBAN AND RURAL.

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.860
OF PROJECTS ARE WILL CERTAIN NOT

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:54.464
FORGOTTEN AND SO THAT IS A VERY

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.432
IMPORTANT TO THE COMMISSION --

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:59.035
SO I THINK EIGHT A I GUESS THE

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:01.304
LASTLY FIVE TWENTY TWO MUCH TIME

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:04.207
HERE LASTLY I WOULD JUST WANT TO

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:06.576
SAY THAT -- THE ONLY A REPORT --

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:07.310
DOES CONSIDER FUNDING THE

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:10.113
REGIONAL COMPONENT AS A LUMP SUM.

00:59:10.179 --> 00:59:12.548
AND WE DO AGREE WITH THE LA L.

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.083
THAT IF FRIENDS ARE.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.451
AND PROVIDED THROUGH THE LUMP

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:17.287
SUM IT IN THE REGIONAL COMPONENT

00:59:17.353 --> 00:59:18.821
IT WOULD REMOVE THE PROJECT

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.023
LEVEL OVERSIGHT THAT THE

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.224
COMMISSION HAS.

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.192
THIS COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.394
THE SENATE BILL ONE ACCOUNTING

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.229
ACCOUNTABILITY -- REPORTING

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:27.997
REQUIREMENTS AND THE

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:29.966
COMMISSION'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.468
TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES -- AND

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.070
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAPLE OF THE

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:35.305
COMMISSION AND THIS IS SOMETHING

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:36.773
THAT OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:37.840
CAN CONSIDER.

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:39.676
HOW TO DRESS BUT AS AN EXAMPLE

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:42.278
THE COMMISSION DOES REQUIRE TIME

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:44.981
LISA FUNDS TIMELY USE OF FUNDS?

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:46.716
AND SO IF A PROJECT IS DEDICATED

00:59:46.783 --> 00:59:49.185
FUNDING IT DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.353
WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.721
TIME.

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:53.723
THIS PROJECT FUNDS TO LAPSE AND

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.791
WERE ABLE TO REDIRECT THOSE

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.826
FUNDS TO A PROJECT THAT IS READY

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:57.660
TO GO.

00:59:57.727 --> 00:59:59.562
AND THAT WOULD BE IT ONE EXAMPLE

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.297
OF THAT SO I AM HAPPY LAURIE AND

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.332
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:03.700

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.638
PUT THAT IN A LANGUAGE THAT THE

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.907
MPO IF WE GAVE THEM OUT TO THE

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:13.476
REGIONS AND THEY HAD A PROJECT

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:14.711
THAT LAPSE THE DATE COULD.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.479
THEY COULD DIRECT THAT MONEY

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.915
INTO THEIR THEIR REGION FOR AND

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:23.820

INITIALLY FUNDED.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:41.637
IF THEY WERE TO FAIL OR I'M HAVE

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.106
SOME SAVINGS THEY CAN.

IN HOW YOU ARE EDUCATING

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:36.292
ACTUALLY LOCALS ON THOSE COUNTS --

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:41.964
AND NOT DOING IT IN THE WINTER

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.633
WHEN WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.867
SUMMER FALL KATE CAN TALK ABOUT

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:48.037
THAT AND ONE MORE QUESTION

THREE AS WELL -- YES SO WE THAT

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.343
WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THE

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.011
COMMENTS THAT I APPRECIATED MOST

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:55.645
FROM THE LA THIS REPORT BECAUSE

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:56.312
THAT THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.081
POINT AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS --

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:01.751
COMING WITH COMING UP WITH A WAY.

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:04.120
TO WERE A HAVE APPLICATIONS

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:06.022
GATHER CONSISTENT DATA AND THAT

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.291
IS WHERE YOU TAKE YOUR COUNTS

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.626
THE SAME TIME BEFORE IN THE SAME

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.161
TIME AFTER.

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.896
AND THEN USING A CONSISTENT

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.765
METHODOLOGY I WANT TO POINT OUT

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.834
THAT THERE IS NOT.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.001
A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGIES OUT

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.237
THERE ANYWHERE SO WE ARE WORKING

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.572
ON THAT TO OUR TECHNICAL

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.940
ADVISORY COMMITTEEAND TO THE

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.575
ACT OF TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:27.310
CENTER TO DEVELOP THAT IN

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.579
CALIFORNIA THAT WILL -- I THINK

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:32.281
BE A STANDARD PROBABLY FOR THE

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.316
REST OF THE COUNTRY.

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.550
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE L.

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.985
ABILITY OF LOCAL FUNDS

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:43.559
UNDERSTAND IT DOES NEED TO BE

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:43.893
LOCAL MATCH.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.527
ENABLE TO DEDICATE THOSE DOLLARS

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.329
TOWARDS THESE EIGHTY P. ELIGIBLE

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.630
PROJECTS.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.998
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT HAS

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:49.832
ALSO BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.901
HURDLE -- BUT CAN YOU TALK A

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.369
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- IN TAKE

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:54.337
A DEEPER DIVE.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.838
IF I'M UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.641
CORRECTLY WHAT WE SEE AND I CAN

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:00.910
GIVE MORE INFORMATION BUT WHAT

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.578
WE SEE IS A STATE WIDE COMPONENT.

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:03.980
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND SMALL

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.315
URBAN A REAL -- PROJECTS IN THIS

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:08.084
SMALL URBAN RIO COMPONENT BUT

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.585
THEY ARE ALSO COMPETING IN THE

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:10.786
STATE Y. COMPONENT.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:13.322
AND SHOULD ON THAT STRUCTURE

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.124
CHANGE IN THE STATE Y. COMPONENT.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:16.959
THOSE SMALL URBAN ROW.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.227
ENTITIES WOULD HAVE GREAT

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.562
DIFFICULTY COMPETINGWITH SOME

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.164
OF THE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.465
IN THE STATE WHERE COMPONENT

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.467
ACTUALLY THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.035
BECAUSE THESE ARE THESE ARE

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:27.503
AREAS OF THE STATE THAT.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.772
WOULD TAKE THEM MAYBE DECADES TO

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.574
SAVE UP THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.209
CLOSE THE GAP THAT THEY REALLY

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:35.278
NEED -- SOME OF THE PROJECTS

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.579
THAT WE'RE FINDING.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.047
A LOT OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.149
FUNDING OUR STATE ROUTES TO ARE

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:41.350
SAFE PRESS TO SCHOOLS.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.352
IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE

01:03:43.419 --> 01:03:46.355
GRAVEL THEY ARE AND YOU KNOW THE

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.823
THE NEEDS ARE GREAT THE NEEDS

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:49.392
ARE GREAT ACROSS THE STATE.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.426
AND SOME OF THOSE NEEDS WE'RE

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.128
SEEING ARE ARE VERY PROFOUND IN

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:57.934
THE RURAL AND SMALL URBAN AREAS

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.635
AT THE STATE.

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.036
ABSOLUTELY.

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:00.636
I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THAT'S

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:01.204
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE DON'T

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.837
REQUIRE A MATCH AND THE REASON

01:04:01.904 --> 01:04:03.039
THAT WE WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.740
EVERY CYCLE ON IF WE'RE GONNA

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.509
FIND JUST CONSTRUCTION OR NOT.

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:08.778
BUT WE FIND PRECONSTRUCTION

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.447
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF LOW

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.616
RESOURCE AGENCIES THAT WOULD NOT

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.284
HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO THE PRE

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:17.620
CONSTRUCTION WORK. NINE IN I

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.221
KNOW YOU GET THE FEEDBACK AND

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:19.755
THEN -- WE HEAR THE FEEDBACK IS

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.224
THE BAND WITH IS THE MOST

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.525
CHALLENGING PART RIGHT.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:23.759
NOT JUST THE APPLICATION BEING

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:26.162
ABLE TO DO ALL THE PRE WORK IN

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:27.597
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS IN

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:28.864
SENSITIVE AREAS FOR

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:30.566
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RIGHT.

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.035
AND IT COULD BE PAINFUL.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.170
BOTH ON COBBLING TOGETHER

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.072
DOLLARS IN IN BEING ABLE TO GET

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.240

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.744
APPRECIATED IN I'M.

RESEARCH FOR HELPING. TO DRILL

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.767
DOWN ON THIS A LITTLE BIT.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.670
MAY BE YOU ADDRESS THIS BUT WE

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.305
HEAR THERE'S A BURDEN SOME

01:05:09.372 --> 01:05:11.274
APPLICATION PROCESS.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.676

FOLLOW UP FROM.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.581
COUNTERS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.416
PEOPLE ARE USING PEDESTRIAN BIKE

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:22.118
WAYS.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:23.152
IS THERE ANY.

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.920
COMPONENT IN THE APPLICATION

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:28.324
PROCESS THAT REQUIRES HOW.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:30.092
THE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE.

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.194
AND SECONDLY.

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.863
ARE ANY THE MEASUREMENTS THAT

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.431
ARE REQUESTED.

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.766
IS THERE WAITED SHERMAN PEOPLE

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:37.933
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUT OF

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.702
A CAR.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.104
AND ARE USING A BIKE WAY -- TO

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:43.873
COMMUTE TO WORK.

01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:48.511
VERSUS JUST RECREATIONAL USE.

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:51.047
SO TO ANSWER THAT LAST PART DEAD

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:51.747
THAT.

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:53.049
IS REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND I

01:05:53.115 --> 01:05:55.818
THINK THE ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DO

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:59.021
THAT IS -- BY THE TIME OF DAY

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.256
WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE COUNTS IF

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.325
YOU IF YOU IF YOU'RE HAVING HIGH

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.859
COUNTS DURING COMMUTE.

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:05.995
HOURS I THINK THAT YOU CAN MAKE

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.396
AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU ARE.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.798
TAKING SOME CARS OFF THE ROAD BY

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.466
PEOPLE USING THE FACILITIES TO

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:12.835
COMMUTE THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:15.137
BUT I I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.406
SOMETHING AS WE START THINKING

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.575
ABOUT WHAT BETTER DATA WE SHOULD

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.477
GATHER AND WHAT BENEFITS WE

01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:22.945
SHOULD BE ASSESSED SAYING.%

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.547
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ONE THAT WE

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:26.015
SHOULD TRY TO USE ALL OUR

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.983
EXPERTISE TO COME UP WITH THE

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.285
WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.853
YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.590
THAT ME EN MORE LABOR INTENSIVE

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.158
EIGHTY TO THE PROCESS BUT IT

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:37.560
COULD BE THAT IN ADDITION TO

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.228
COUNTERS.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.030
YOU DO JUST.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.298
TO A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.500
INTERVIEWS OF PEOPLE USING THE

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:47.403
TRAIL AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE FROM

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:48.704
A SAMPLE.

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:51.340
OF A SMALL SAMPLE OF PEOPLE DO

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:52.908
SOME EXTRAPOLATION.

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.945
AND REALIZING THAT A LOT OF

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:57.246
ENTITIES DON'T HAVE THE

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.348
RESOURCES TO DO THE EXTENSIVE

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.583
COUNTS THAT MAYBE.

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:02.985
SOME OTHERS DO THE ACTOR

FIFTY ONE MILES LIKE.

01:10:06.802 --> 01:10:07.970
WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE DOING

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:09.838
BETTER I GUESS IN LA?

TO COME UP WITH THAT BIG VISION

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:15.311
AND HOW CAN YOU HELP WITH THAT.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:18.380
WE'RE IN THE FOR CYCLE OF THE

01:10:18.447 --> 01:10:21.150
THE PROGRAM AND WHAT I THINK WE

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:22.718
SAW IN THE INITIAL CYCLES IS

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.386
THAT THERE IS A REALLY PAN OUT

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.421
NEED.

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:26.288
FOR KIND OF LIKE BREAD AND

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:27.990
BUTTER PROJECTS OUT THERE THERE

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.526
WAS A LOT OF NEED SO SO A LOT OF

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.728
THAT WAS ADDRESSED BUT SO IN

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.630
THIS LAST CYCLE IN PARTICULAR WE

01:10:34.697 --> 01:10:37.299
ARE LOOKING TO NOT JUST GETTING.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.501
A PROJECT BUT THE BEST PROJECT

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.338
SO TO THAT END WE ADDED A COUPLE

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:44.707
QUESTIONS IN THE APPLICATION FOR

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.609
THE LARGER PROJECTS THAT WE

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:47.810
WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.712
APPLICANT'S HOW.

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:51.380
THEIR PROJECT WAS.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:52.715
USING CONTEXT SENSITIVE

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.883
SOLUTIONS AND HOW IT WAS

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.286
TRANSFORMATIVE AND WE WE DID A

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.587
SOMEWHAT OF A TEST THIS TIME

01:10:58.654 --> 01:11:00.155
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:01.123
SOMETHING IN THERE THAT THE

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.324
APPLICANT'S JUST COULD NOT

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.560
ANSWER AND I WAS JUST SO

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.528
IMPRESSED BY THE ANSWERS THAT WE

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.930
GOT ACROSS THE STATE.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:11.200
FROM HOW -- APPLICANTS WERE ABLE --

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.935
TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND I

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:15.804
THINK THAT IS A SIGN OF HOW.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.172
PLANNING FOR ACTOR

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.707
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS HAS

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.976
ADVANCED EVEN SINCE THE YEARS OF

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:23.679
THE ATP SO SINCE THAT WAS

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:25.280
SUCCESSFUL QUIRK THOSE WERE

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.582
SUCCESSFUL QUESTIONS IN THIS

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:27.249
CYCLE.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:28.684
I THINK THAT WE WOULD TRY TO

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.419
EXPAND ON THAT FOR THE NEXT

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.988
CYCLE.

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:34.590
THERE WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS A

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.725
VERY GOOD BOOK WALKING IN LA

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.795
DESPITE THE SONG TO THE CONTRARY.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.096
ALL RIGHT THIS IS.

01:11:41.163 --> 01:11:42.765

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:43.799

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.948
THE FIRST ROUND.

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:26.949
THE NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE BEEN

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.817
SAID I HAD DIRECTOR BRANSON AND

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.819
AND MORE WATERS HAVE CLARIFIED

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.155
SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES -- BUT I

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:34.957
DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE A FEW

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:38.160
THINGS I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:40.162
LISTENING INTENTION.

SO FIRST OF ALL AT THE IT HAS TO

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.999
BE EMPHASIZED THIS IS A HEAVILY

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:45.801
UNIQUE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.970
PROCESS I'D DIFFERENT FROM OTHER

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.905
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:51.473
HAVE AN AND COMPETITIVE.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.542
PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND

01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:55.477
WITH THE CDC HAS DONE IS SERVED

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:59.181
AS A SORT OF A AN ENTITY THAT'S

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.882
CONTINUE TO KEEP THINGS

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:01.650
CONSISTENT.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.652
AND IN THE DIRECTION OF

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:06.021
CONSENSUS BUILDING AMONG VARIOUS

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.556
STAKEHOLDERS LIKE ACROSS THE

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.224
STATE A AND AND VARIOUS

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.159
INTERESTS RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:13.729
HELPED TO MANAGE ALL OF THOSE

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:17.165
TYPES OF ACCOMMODATIONS IT'S

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.568
BEEN A NEGOTIATION -- ENTITY

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:20.869
AMONG THESE.

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.738
THESE AT THESE SAY HOLDERS IT'S

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:25.007
HAS A A ROBUST AND ENGAGED A

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.342
TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.610
MEETING EVERY.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:31.580
A QUARTER QUARTERLY REALLY --

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:32.948
CONSISTS A CONSISTING OF

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:37.319
VISITATION OF MPO SMALL RUN RULE.

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.354
LOCAL ADVOCACY AND STATE RIGHT

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:42.190
ADVOCACY SO AGAIN AT HEAVILY --

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:43.725
ENGAGEMENT HAD.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.594
ON ON THAT SIDE SO THERE'S A

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.829
NUMBER OF EYES LOOKING AT THIS

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.664
PROGRAM REGULARLY AND HOW CAN BE

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.867
IMPROVED ANOTHER THING TO ADD.

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:53.668
AT LAST CYCLE THERE WAS TEN I

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.070
BELIEVE WORKSHOPS STAKEHOLDER

01:17:55.137 --> 01:17:57.672
WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.475
THAT'S AGAIN AN UNPRECEDENTED

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.010
FOR SOMETHING ON THIS LEVEL SO.

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.346
THIS IS REALLY A PROGRAM OF THE

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.981
OF THE GRASSROOTS THAT THE

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:07.883
GROUNDWORK I ALL OF THE

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:09.684
DIFFERENT VOICES AT AT THAT ARE

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:11.153
WORKING ON THIS. ONE OF THE

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:13.822
BIGGEST ISSUES AND THAT WE SEE

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:14.923
IS THAT THIS IS AN

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.024
OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAMTHAT'S

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.493
BEEN DESCRIBED -- YOU KNOW AT

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.062
THIS LAST CYCLE THERE WAS ABOUT

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.663
A TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:25.400
ASKED TOTAL -- AND ONLY ABOUT

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:25.967
FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:28.070
AVAILABLE I AM BUT THAT'S JUST

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:30.305
WHAT'S APPLIED TO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.807
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANTS

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:33.341
ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS EVERY

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:36.344
COMMUNITY. FOR CITY OF THE OF

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:37.646
COLTON FOR EXAMPLE IN SAMBHAR

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:40.682
DINO AT THAT'S AFFECTED BY QUITE

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:43.151
A BIT OF OF TRUCK TRAFFIC SO YOU

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:43.852
KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.787
DISADVANTAGE COMMUNICANT ON IN

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:46.221
THERE.

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:48.056
IT'S A FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED I

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:49.858
BELIEVE IT A FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:51.293
IS THE POPULATION BUT THEY'RE

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.594
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.496
BUILD IT OUT IS FOURTEEN MILLION

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.630
DOLLARS AND SO.

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:57.065
THAT'S JUST A SMALL COMMUNITY IF

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.800
YOU LOOK AT RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.502
THEIR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.070
THAT'S SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SO.

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:03.105
BUILDING OUT OUR ACTIVE

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:05.107
TRANSPORTATION PLANS TAKES QUITE

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:07.242
A BIT OF INVESTMENT THAT THIS

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:09.277
PROGRAM CAN'T YOU KNOW MEET AT

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.246
AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS SO

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:14.216
IT'S CREATED A COMPETITIVE --

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.051
QUITE A COMPETITIVE EDGE AND AND

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.452
SO.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:18.987
THAT'S REALLY THE ROOT OF A LOT

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.922
OF THE ISSUES PROCESS WISE AND

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:22.524
AND HOW THINGS ARE EVALUATED

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:27.529
AGAIN THAT'S BEEN.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.431
HEAVILY.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:30.499
DESIGNED BY ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:31.500
ENGAGEMENT LEVELS AT EACH LEVEL

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:33.301
AND AND THE EVALUATOR TEAMS YEAH

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.536
THESE ARE.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.804
NATIONALS THAT VOLUNTEER THEIR

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.305
TIME OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.375
MONTHS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.043
CAN WE AS A STATE MEET THE STATE

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:43.411
BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM.

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.314
AND NOT AN END THE REGION AT THE

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:46.781
REGIONAL LEVEL THERE'S

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:49.518
DEFINITELY PRIORITIES -- BUT

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:50.652
SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:52.087
ARE APPLYING OUR SMALLER

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.588
COMMUNITIES AREN'T THEY MAY NOT

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.157
THEY'LL BE OVERLOOKED IN

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:58.026
REGIONAL -- PRIORITIES OFTEN --

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.594
AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.997
SURE THAT WE CONTAINABLE THE THE

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.965
I'M INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM AND

01:20:04.032 --> 01:20:05.834
ITS CONTINUED GROWTH AT THE

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.403
OTHER BEING THAT -- THERE'S A

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.006
LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:11.940
THAT'S BEEN.

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:13.175
BUT IT HERE AND IT AND IT'S FREE

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:16.211
OFTEN WE ARE WE ARE OURSELVES

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:16.811
AND OUR STATE PARTNERS PROVIDE

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.079
THIS.

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.915
AND ALSO -- SEE FROM SCHOOL

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:20.849
NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP THAT'S NOT

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:22.217
HERE TODAY SO THERE'S THAT AND

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.685
AND THAT THE ACTOR

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.187
TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.488
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY.

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:28.123
A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.625
FUNDING CAN I GO TO PLACES OF

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.227
NEED AND BUT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:33.562
AT WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THAT

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.130
NEED AND HOW REGION'S CAN LOOK

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:36.865
AT OHER SOURCES OF FUNDING TO

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:37.365
MEET.

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:41.102
MAYBE THE SMALLER -- AT TYPES OF

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:43.271
PROJECTS THAT ARE MORE YOU KNOW

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:43.872
LIKE WE SAID BROWN BUTTER BUT

01:20:43.939 --> 01:20:45.340
LOOK AT BACK TO TRANSPORTATION

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.108
PROGRAM IS TRYING TO ME A LOT OF

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:48.810
DIFFERENT GOALS RIGHT AT THE

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.045
SAME TIME SO.

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.213
I HAVE CREDIT MORE TO SAY DON'T

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:54.916
TAKE MORE TIME BUT I THANK YOU

CALIFORNIA LOCKS ME ONE ECHO A

01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:00.989
LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:02.591
COLLEAGUE LINDA MADE FROM CAL BY

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.425

ATTENTION.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.261
AND I'LL TRY TO BE CONCISE -- SO

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.996
I DO WANT TO ECHO THE FACT THAT

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.331
THE PROGRAM NEEDS MORE FUNDING

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.099
AND THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:11.733
GO AROUND FOR ALL THE NEEDS OF

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.835
THE STATE -- I WANNA APPLIED AT

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:14.836
DIRECTOR BRANSON AND LAURIE

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.805
WATERS WHO DO A PHENOMENAL JOB

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:17.839
OF MANAGING THE ACTIVE

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.274
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.875
REALLY BEING INCLUSIVE AND AND

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.377
MOST IMPORTANTLY AS MENTIONED BY

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.211
THE DIRECTOR.

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:24.913
TRANSPARENT WITH THE PROCESS IN

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.781
WITH BUILDING UP THE GUIDELINES --

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.183
FOR THIS PROGRAM THE OTHER THING

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.984
I WANT TO CALL OUT THAT WAS

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.485
MENTIONED DEBATE I BELIEVE IN LA

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:31.786
RAIL AND THERE IS AN OFFICE OF

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:32.887
RESEARCH WHICH WE WERE ALSO PART

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:34.589
OF SAID THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.691
TIME AND AND ATTENTION ON THAT --

01:21:36.758 --> 01:21:38.026
BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT THIS AB

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.394
SORT OF THOUGHT AS YOU KNOW THE

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:40.595
MPO IS BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:42.030
PROJECTS AND WHAT YOU'LLSEE IN

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.231
TERMS OF THE STATE COMPETITION

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:45.700
IS THAT THE PROJECT APPLICANTS

01:21:45.767 --> 01:21:47.469
ARE VERY DIVERSE -- WHILE THEY

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:48.270
ALL AS DIRECTOR BRANSON CALLED

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.504
OUT FALL WITHIN THE REGIONAL

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:51.172
TRANSPORTATION PLAN BUT WE DO

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:52.040
SEE IS THAT SOME OF THOSE MAY

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.842
NOT BE HIGHLY PRIORITIZE BECAUSE

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.176
THEY'RE SMALLER PROJECTS PHYLLIS

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:56.011
SIDEWALK.

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:56.945
AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THINGS

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.280
THAT ARE HELPING CHILDREN WALK

01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.581
TO SCHOOL BACK TO SCHOOL

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.449
COMMUNITIES ACROSS A BUSY STREET

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:02.817
TO GET TO A GROCERY STORE SO

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:07.756
THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:08.590
FALL HIGH IN A PRIORITY FOR

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:08.957
REGIONAL PLANT.

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:09.991
BUT ARE VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:10.925
COMMUNITY AND ARE SOMETHING THAT

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:11.593
THE STATE STILL NEEDS TO ADDRESS

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.427
THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:14.162
PROJECTS AND WHAT GOES INTO THAT

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:15.630
50% OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE YOU

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:16.931
KNOW FUNDED IS ALSO VERY

01:22:16.998 --> 01:22:17.832
IMPORTANT.

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:19.434
AND WE SEE THAT AS A STRENGTH OF

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.235
THE PROGRAM TO FUND THESE

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.703
DIVERSE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT BE

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.204
HIGHER ON PRIORITY BUT STILL

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.406
FALL WITHIN THE PLAN.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.473
AND THEN HAVE THAT 40%

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.309
ALLOCATION AND PO'S TO

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:28.610
PRIORITIZE THOSE FUNDS AS THOUGH

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.145
WE DEFINITELY SEE THE BENEFIT OF

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.479
HAVING THE SPLIT AS IT IS.

EVERY STATES FACE WITH THE SAME

01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:23.556
ISSUES NOT JUST CALIFORNIA

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.792
THERE'S A ONE TIME KIND OF

01:54:25.858 --> 01:54:28.328
WORKLOAD THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS.

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:30.230

IT'S PEOPLE MOVING TO OUR STATE.

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:41.007
INTO OUR MIX THAT THAT'S JUST A

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.942
NORMAL PROCESS AND THEY WILL BE

AND AND I DON'T SEE IT AS BEING

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.016
AN ONGOING I THINK ONGOING WE

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:52.285

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.320

01:54:58.524 --> 01:54:59.125
PROBABLY SOMETHING WE CAN ALWAYS

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.093
TALK ABOUT.

01:55:00.159 --> 01:55:01.227
BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF REALLY

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:02.562
DE IT'S TRYING TO MANAGE I THINK

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:04.097
THIS ONE TIME EFFORT THAT WE

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:38.197
QUESTION WHAT THE LA -- WAS WHAT

02:10:38.263 --> 02:10:39.998

MONEY FOR THE DEAL.

02:10:46.004 --> 02:10:48.006
J. AGENTS INTO C. H. P.'S BUDGET

THAT IF THEY CAN'TGET.

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:03.722
A DOJ AGENT THEY COULD THEN USE

02:11:03.789 --> 02:11:05.624
THE MONEY FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHP

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:07.726
OFFICER AND IF THEY GET IF IF I

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:09.661
DO CHANGES AVAILABLE THEY COULD

02:11:09.728 --> 02:11:11.797
PROVIDE DOJ WITHOUT MONEY AS

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.732

SAME NUMBER OF POSITIONS.

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:17.002
ON THE TASK FORCE -- BUT THE MIX

BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S A C. H. P.

02:11:18.570 --> 02:11:20.305
POSITION OR DOJ POSITION ON THE

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:22.007
TASK FORCE THAT'S WHY WE WANT
