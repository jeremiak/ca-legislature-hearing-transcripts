DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS- WITH

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:07.145
EXTREME HEAT- THAT WE HAVE OUT

00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:09.481
POINT OUT ON THAT THE COOLING

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:10.916
COMMUNITIES IT SEEMS AS THOUGH

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.785
THE SCHOOL YARD URBAN FORESTRY.

WHILE IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.723
THE TREES TO GROW WOULD CREATE

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:21.393
AND- A LONG TERM. INFRASTRUCTURE

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.864
CHANGES- AND THE NATURAL WAY TO.

00:19:25.931 --> 00:19:28.066
DEAL WITH THE HEATING VERSUS

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.167
PUTTING AN AIR CONDITIONER IN A

OUTSIDE YOU THE AREA OUTSIDE IS

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:39.177
HOT. DO YOU UNBALANCE THE

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.747
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. IS MORE ON

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.082

GENERAL COOLING. IS THAT YOUR

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:52.024
OBSERVATION ARE. HE SAID THIS AT

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.927
CLEAR WHAT THE ACTION IS- I

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:56.795
THINK SO I MEAN I THINK YOU KNOW

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.030
THERE THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.631
BE A BALANCE ALSO BETWEEN KIND

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:01.133
AND NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS LIKE

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:03.602
YOU'RE REFERENCING KIND OF TREES

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:07.639
AND- KIND OF MORE OF THAT KIND

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.341
OF YEAH MORE TREES TO PROVIDE

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.376
MORE SHADE AND- COMMITTEE

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.345
SETTINGS SUCH AS SCHOOLS BIRTH

00:20:13.412 --> 00:20:16.014
IS ALSO- AND- MORE THINGS THE

00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:17.416
MORE LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

00:20:17.482 --> 00:20:19.117
RETROFITS OR AIR CONDITIONING

00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:21.787
UNITS. THAT COULD COOL- AND

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:25.591
BUILDINGS SO AND I THINK TO A

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:27.259
CERTAIN EXTENT A CERTAIN LEVEL

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:29.127
OF EXTREME HE IS INEVITABLE SO I

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.229
DO THINK SOME OF THE SHORT TERM

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.631
INTERVENTIONS TO DIRECTLY

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:34.666
PROVIDE RELIEF IS REALLY

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.770
IMPORTANT I'M BUT AS YOU SAID IT

00:20:38.837 --> 00:20:40.806
IT DOES HAVE TO KIND OF BALANCE

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:41.940
WITH SOME OF THE OTHER CLIMATE

00:20:42.007 --> 00:20:43.642
MITIGATION STRATEGIES THAT. THIS

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.344
COMMITTEE HAS ALSO BEEN ADDED

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.812
CONSIDERING AND OTHER OTHER

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.014
PACKAGES AND UP AFTER AT THE

THE- WITH THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.953
COUNCIL WITH THE RESILIENCY

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.522
CENTERS IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:20:57.589 --> 00:21:02.027
BE LOOKING AT LIBRARIES.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:02.794
COMMUNITY CENTERS. CAN FAIRS

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.730
PLACES WERE WERE PEOPLE

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.466
CONGREGATE AND THEN PUTTING IN

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.868
AIR CONDITIONING AND OR PUTTING

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.103
IN. SOMETHING THAT WOULD CREATE

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:14.840
A- A COOLER ENVIRONMENT IS

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:17.809
SERVICE- THIS IS NECESSARILY

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:19.611
GOING INTO INDIVIDUAL HOMES IN

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.546
GIVING SOMEBODY AN AT AN AIR

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.448
CONDITIONING UNIT IS THAT YOUR

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:25.684
READ ON IT IS IT IS THAT THEY

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:27.753
WOULD BE YOU KNOW WE TRY TO GET

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:28.987
THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.188
FOR THIS HUNDRED AND SEVENTY.

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:32.391
MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE AREAS

00:21:32.457 --> 00:21:33.158
THAT ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED AND

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:36.795
THAT. IT'S IT IT'S AN EXISTING.

00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:37.929
CENTER THAT'S COULD BE TURNED

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:39.965
INTO A COOLING CENTER I GUESS I

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.300
SHOULD SAY. OR YOU DO NOT READ

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.202

IMPROVEMENTS WHICH COULD INCLUDE

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:01.887
AND SOME COOLING OR EFFICIENCY

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:06.224
UPGRADES AND- DAD'S AT. SO IT

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:10.095
COULD YOU KNOW. AND BENEFIT MORE

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.166

THINKING ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER

00:25:25.891 --> 00:25:28.260
A PACKAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.729
THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:33.331
FACING TWO CHALLENGES AROUND THE

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:35.300
HEAT. AB ROUND ONE IS THESE

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.235
EXTREME HEAT EVENTS WHERE IT'S

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:39.271
REALLY REALLY HOT FOR A COUPLE

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.139
OF DAYS AND WE NEED PLACES FOR

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:43.174

00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:44.943
THERE'S ALSO AND IN PARTICULAR

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.044
IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.112
WILL WE'RE GONNA JUST HAVE

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:49.347
SUSTAINED DAYS OF MUCH HIGHER

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:51.650
TEMPERATURES WHERE IT'S NOT KIND

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:54.252
OF A ONE OR TWO OR THREE DAY

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:57.789
ISSUE IT'S MORE OF A LIKE. ALSO

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:59.925
KIND OF ISSUE WHERE. THEY MAY

00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:01.960
NOT BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.328
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO SOMEPLACE

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.230
ELSE OUT OF THEIR HOME FOR LONG

00:26:05.297 --> 00:26:07.165
PERIODS OF TIME WHEN THEY HAVE

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.300
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY HAVE

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.468

COOLER TEMPERATURE AND SO I

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.210

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:21.279

INTEGRATION OF EXTREME HEAT

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:48.119
MAKES SENSE. THERE ARE OTHER

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.007
SO I JUST I WANTED TO SORT OF A

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.575

APPRECIATE THE PINPOINTING OF

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.688
THIS. THIS ISSUE BY THE

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.023
ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:14.225
IN PARTICULAR I WANT EXPRESS MY

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:17.662
GRATITUDE ON- CALLING OUT

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:19.997
EXTREME HEAT AS- WHAT IT IS

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:22.466
WHICH IS THE SILENT KILLER AND

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:24.535
THE LARGEST CLIMATE IMPACT IN

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:25.770
THE STATE THAT NO ONE'S REALLY

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:29.206
TALKING ABOUT- WE STILL. I THINK

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.608
ARE UNDERESTIMATING HOW MANY

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.276
PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR FROM

00:38:32.343 --> 00:38:35.713
EXTREME HEAT INCIDENTS- ACTUALLY

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.448
IN THEIR HOMES BUT ALSO IN

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.650
STRESSES IT FROM THE WORKPLACE-

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:41.085
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S- THERE'S

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.887
A LACK OF COOLING AT NIGHT- HEAT

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:46.891
EXPOSURE. PRETERM BIRTHS THE

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:49.226
LIST GOES ON- SO I REALLY

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:52.897
APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION-

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.131
HONING IN ON THIS CHALLENGE IN

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:56.067
TRYING TO PUT. A COMPREHENSIVE

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:58.169
PACKAGE TOGETHER BUT I WANTED TO

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.805
BUILD ON- DEBBIE SECRETARY

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:03.908
HANSON'S- TO FLESHING OUT THERE

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:07.712
WHICH WHICH M. TO ME SORT OF

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:10.448
COULD ROUND OUT THE STRATEGY-

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.115
BECAUSE WHEN I READ THE

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:14.585
ANALYSIS. STATING THAT. THE

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:18.889
PACKAGE- DOES NOT HAVE A FUNDING

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.726
FOR- BUILDING LEVEL

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:24.495
INTERVENTIONS. SUCH AS

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:25.796
IMPROVEMENTS OF COOLING OR

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.465
ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS IN

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:30.568
PRIVATE RESIDENCES- THAT'S

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:33.704
CONCERNING- FOR WHAT I HEAR YOU

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:36.240
SAYING IS. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:38.275
NOT IN THE PACKAGE IS JUST NOT

00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:41.112
LISTED HERE IN THE CHART CAN WE

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.080
PLEASE TO HONE IN ON THAT

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.248
BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT FOR

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.116
INSTANCE THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:48.219
IS NOT. AMONG THE CAVALCADE OF

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.521
AGENCIES INVOLVED HERE TODAY IN

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:52.189
THIS EXTREME HEAT STRATEGY AND

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:54.625
YET THEY'LL BE THE ONES- THEY

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:56.927
HAVE A SIX MILLION HEAT PUMP BY

00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.362
TWENTY THIRTY GOAL N. ARE

00:39:58.429 --> 00:39:59.730
HEADING UP THE BUILDING

00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:01.799
DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY WHICH

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.534
HAS CRITICAL AREAS OF OVERLAP.

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:05.669
I'M I'D BE REMISS THAT WE WENT

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:08.272
AROUND AND INSTALLED A BUNCH OF

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.174
GAS BASED. I'M COOLING

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.978
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE THEN HAD

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.746
TO. ABANDON THOSE STRANDED

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:17.882
ASSETS ONLY MAKE TRANSITIONS

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:20.618
AWAY FROM THE GAS SYSTEM SO CAN

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:23.821
EITHER DEPUTY SECRETARY YOU OR

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:28.359
SOMEONE ELSE WITHIN- WITHIN THIS

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.928
THIS FRAMEWORK MAYBE IN A

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:32.930
DIFFERENT DIRECTOR KEY CAN YOU.

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.632
CAN YOU FLESH OUT THOSE PIECES

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.433
THAT AREN'T HERE THAT FOCUS

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.569
SPECIFICALLY ON PEOPLE IN THEIR

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:43.073
HOMES- FIDELIO NOTED- DURING

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.208
EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THE LAST

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:47.077
THING YOU WANT TO RECOMMEND FOR

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.045
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY WHO RELY ON

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.914
SAY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.683
WALKING IS TO GO MAKE A HOUR

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.053
LONG COMMUTE- WHEN THEY'RE

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.987
EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND GOING

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:59.657
THROUGH- YOU KNOW THE EARLY

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:03.093
PHASES OF HEAT STROKE TO GO. TRY

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.894
TO FIND THEIR WAY TO A LOCAL

00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:06.997
LIBRARY- THE BEST THING WE CAN

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.299
DO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SO

00:41:08.365 --> 00:41:10.100
VULNERABLE IS KEEP THEM AT HOME

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.602
AND MAKE SURE THAT ESPECIALLY IF

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.804
THEY'RE IN RENTAL UNITS- THAT

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:14.672
THEIR LANDLORDS ARE ENSURING

00:41:14.738 --> 00:41:16.640
THAT THEIR THEIR PLACES IS

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:19.109
SUFFICIENTLY COOL IN THAT. THOSE

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:21.111
BUILDINGS HAVE THE HEAT PUMP

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:24.548
CAPACITY TO KEEP THEM COOL- SO

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.784
CAN YOU CAN YOU ALSO JUST KIND

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:28.652
OF DIGGING ON THAT FOR A SECOND

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.521
EXPLAIN MAYBE WHY THE ENERGY

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:31.989
COMMISSION IS NOT INVOLVED WITH

00:41:32.056 --> 00:41:34.091
THE EXTREME HEAT STRATEGY AND-

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:34.925
HOW SOME OF THESE OTHER

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.026
COMPONENTS YOU'D MENTION LIE

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.162
WITH. HOW YOU EXPECT THOSE TO

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.930
SOARED INTERFACE AT THE

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:43.968
RESIDENTIAL LEVEL. YES SO THIS

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:47.271
IS A NEW AND MARQUIS I WILL-

TOGETHER BOTH THE EXTREME HEAT

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.619
ACTION PLAN AND THEN. THIS IS A

00:42:01.685 --> 00:42:04.221
PROPOSAL FOR THE SENATE SIDE.

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:06.657
REALLY WANTING TO TAKE. ALL OF

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:07.591
GOVERNMENTS AND

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.193
INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.295
RECOGNIZING THAT EVERY SECTOR

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.630
AND ESPECIALLY EVERY STATE

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:14.298
AGENCY HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:17.334
PLAY IN RESPONDING TO THE

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:19.570
IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT ACROSS

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.772
ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO SO. NOT

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.274
JUST TO YOUR POINT SPECIFICALLY

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.009
AROUND THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:27.177
THEY ABSOLUTELY WORK HE PARTNER

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:28.979
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOTH

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.347
THE EXTREME HEAT ACTION PLAN AS

THERE IS FUNDING NEED TO BE ABLE

00:42:35.753 --> 00:42:37.288
TO DRIVE SOLUTIONS ON THE GROUND

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.089
SO ENERGY COMMISSION WHILE THEY

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:40.824
ARE NOT REFLECTED EXPLICITLY IN

00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.127
THIS. EXTREME HEAT SATISFIED

00:42:43.193 --> 00:42:45.829
FUNDING PROPOSAL THERE ARE

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.331
MULTIPLE WAYS WHERE THEY

HUNDRED MILLION FOR EXTREME HEAT

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.052
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A THREE

DIDN'T GET IT AND SINCE WE'RE

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:51.561
HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. HOW THE

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:52.696
REST OF THE SENATORS AND THE

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.364
LEGISLATORS WOULD UNDERSTAND

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.732
WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:57.968
PROPOSING IN THIS AREA DID YOU

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:00.537

BULLETS WE GAVE YOU AS AS

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:04.975
OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS ONE

00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:07.778
OF THEM IS THIS IS THIS IS NOT

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:09.112
IN ISOLATION YOU KNOW THERE'S AN

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:09.746
ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:10.981
AND THEN WE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.516
THOSE PIECES- YOU KNOW FOR

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:13.984
PUBLIC HEALTH DATA AND THAT SORT

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:16.019
OF THING. I THINK I THINK OUR

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.321
OVERARCHING POINT YOU IS REALLY

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.989
WHAT YOU ARE STARTING TO GET OUT

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.624
WHICH IS THINK ABOUT THIS

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:22.592
STRATEGICALLY AS A WHOLE WHAT

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.061
ARE YOUR PRIORITIES YOU KNOW

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.496
WHAT ARE KIND OF. YEAH I USUALLY

00:49:26.563 --> 00:49:27.631
WE THINK THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:29.666
IS ONE IMPORTANT ONE-

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:32.135
PARTICULARLY AS SENATOR STERN AT

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:35.372
NOTED GIVEN- THE VULNERABLE.

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.107
POPULATIONS WHO LIVE IN

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:38.875
RESIDENCES THAT ARE- ARE ARE

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:40.944
KIND MOST AT RISK FROM SOME OF

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.213
THESE CHALLENGES SO- I THINK

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.781
THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.917
POINTS DO YOU IS THINK THINK

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:47.584
ABOUT THESE PIECES ALL TOGETHER

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:50.954
AND NOT NOT IN ISOLATION- BUT

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.123
THEN ACROSS ALL OF THEM. YOU

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.458

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.826
BE WHAT ARE YOUR BIGGEST

00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.060

CATEGORIES OR AREAS THAT YOU

00:49:58.028 --> 00:50:01.331
THINK. ARE MOST IMPORTANT ND I

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.033
THINK THEY ARE PART OF WHAT THIS

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.334
CONVERSATION IS HIGHLIGHTING AS

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.869
WE ARE STILL I THINK OF THE

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:08.538
STATE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.140
DEVELOPING- A STRATEGIC PLANNING

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:11.808
GRAPPLING WITH THIS THIS CLIMATE

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.410
CHALLENGE THAT MINISTRATION IS

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:15.212

OUTCOMES AND HOW DO WE BUILD

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:25.489
TOWARDS THOSE SO- DID DID THIS

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:27.224
IS A FOR THE FIRST THIS IS NOT

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.025
THE ONLY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:29.092 --> 00:50:30.827
IS GOING TO BE AT DECIDING HOW

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.496

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:05.822
PROTECTED UNDER THIS PROPOSAL-

00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.023
IS IT A SORT OF REGIONAL

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.593
COVERAGE ISSUE IS THAT. YOU KNOW

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.862
IT AND IT'S HONESTLY A PER. ACRE

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:14.798
PER MILE- YOU KNOW RATIO OF

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.501
INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE I. MEAN

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.069
TO ME PEOPLE SHOULD ALWAYS DRIVE

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.771
IT AND SO. I BUT I DIDN'T I JUST

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.974
DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.209
PEOPLE WE THINK. THIS CURRENT

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.944
PROPOSAL INCLUDING ALL THE OTHER

00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.880
ELEMENTS INCLUDING THE FIVE

00:52:29.946 --> 00:52:30.914
HUNDRED ANDVERY IMPORTANTLY

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:34.117
NOTING THAT THE SIX HUNDRED

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.785
TWENTY TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:36.286
FOR EQUITABLE BUILDING

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.454
DECARBONIZATION PLUS THE

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.956
ADDITIONAL FIFTY. THERE'S A

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.758
BILLION DOLLARS FOR BUILDING D.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.727
CARD THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE IT GO

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:47.597
UP IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET- BUT-

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.432
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.834
ANTICIPATE THIS STRATEGY.

00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:54.404
HELPING. A VERY IMPORTANT

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:56.840
QUESTION I THINK. YEAH SOMETHING

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.975
THAT WE GRAPPLE WITH WHEN IT

00:52:59.042 --> 00:53:01.778
COMES TO ADD QUANTIFYING THE

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.980
OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE RESILIENT

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:06.116
INVESTMENTS IS THAT IT'S VERY

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:08.618
DEPENDENT ON THE TYPE OF PROGRAM

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:11.655
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THE

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:14.224
METRICS AND SORT OF GOT GOAL

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.259
POSTS ALONG THE WAY FOR THE

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:17.727
INVESTMENT IN THE EQUITABLE

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.030
BUILDING D. KERR- PROPOSAL IS

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.965
GOING TO THEY'RE NECESSARILY

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.500
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:26.136
METRICS. AND GUIDEPOSTS ALONG

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:28.204
THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.539
TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:53:29.606 --> 00:53:31.975
OUR- YOU KNOW WORKER PROTECTIONS

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.044
AND ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS AND SO

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.211
WHAT I THINK THE BIG PICTURE

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.213
MESSAGE TO YOU IT IS THAT AS WE

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.749
ROLL OUT EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:41.751
THERE WILL BE TWO METRICS THAT

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.787
WE ARE GOING TO BE MEASURING OUR

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:46.156
PROGRESS AGAINST. THAT DRIVE IN

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.191
PARTICULAR ON THAT THE

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:51.328
PRIORITIES FOR STATE ADAPTATION

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.563
IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S SIX

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.031
PRIORITIES THAT WE'VE LAID OUT

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:57.233
BURKE AS NORTHSTAR'S WHEN WE'RE

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.102
INVESTING IN A CLIMATE RESILIENT

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.338
PROGRAM WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.206
AND YOU KNOW THESE OUTCOMES ARE

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.574
YOU KNOW PROTECTING VULNERABLE

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.776
COMMUNITIES. YEAH MAKING

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.111
DECISIONS BASED ON BEST

00:54:08.178 --> 00:54:10.180
AVAILABLE SCIENCE- AND YOU KNOW

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.815
WE'VE INCLUDED VERY SPECIFIC

00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:14.584
SUCCESS METRICS IN BEING USED

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.086
DON'T DID TO MEASURE OUR

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.320
PROGRESS AGAINST THESE

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:18.822
PRIORITIES AND SO WHEN WE BUILD

00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:21.324
OUT THE FINAL PACKAGE HERE WE'RE

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.926
GOING TO BE ENSURING THAT EACH

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:24.861
OF THE PROGRAMS BASED ON YOU

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:27.797
KNOW THEIR SPECIFIC- AREAS OF

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.032
FOCUS THE FACTOR THAT ARE

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:30.767
WORKING IN. THAT ARE GOING TO BE

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:32.736
DRIVING ON THOSE PRIORITIES AND

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.404
ARE GOING TO HAVE CLEAR METRICS

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.039
FOR SUCCESS IN YOU KNOW

00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:38.274
PROTECTING PEOPLE BUILDING

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:47.684
COMMUNITY ANDECONOMIC.

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:49.953
SENATOR STERN IT IS A REALLY

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.388
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION TO HAVE

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:53.623
AT THE BEGINNING A IS WHAT WHAT

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.958
INFORMATION ARE WE LOOKING FOR

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.559
IF THESE ARE PILOT PROJECTS SOME

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:59.162
OF THEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO TEST

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.030
OUT AND SEE WHAT WORKS ARE WE

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:02.432
GONNA BE COLLECTING THE

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.099
INFORMATION WE NEED TO COME BACK

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.402
ON THE OTHER SIDE AND DO THAT

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:08.371
SORT OF EVALUATION- SO AS MY

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:09.706
CALLING THIS ROW MENTION IN THIS

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:13.543
IN YOUR- AGENDA. THINKING ABOUT

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.278
IS THEIR DIGITAL RESEARCH AND IS

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.379
THERE SOME FUNDING THAT PERHAPS

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.581
SHOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR DOING SO

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:21.751
MUCH OF THAT WORK TO DO SOME OF

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.520
THAT RIGOROUS TESTING OF WHAT

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:25.088
DID WORK WHAT WHAT DO WE GET

00:55:25.155 --> 00:55:27.557
FROM FROM THE FUNDING WHAT WERE

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:28.925
THE OUTCOMES- SO SOME OF IT

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.760
COULD JUST BE REPORTING LANGUAGE

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.996
AND PLAN INCLUDING THAT BUT BUT

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.465
YOU ALSO COULD THINK ABOUT ARE

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:35.965
THERE SPECIFIC RESEARCH

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.267
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE FUNDING

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.335
THAT NEEDS TO BE DEDICATED TO

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:40.570
DOING SOME OF THAT EVALUATION

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.372
SO. THAT AS AGAIN THIS PROBLEM

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.374
IS NOT GOING AWAY- WHEN WE'RE

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.443
REVISITING THIS IN A COUPLE OF

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:47.677
YEARS- AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.279
TO MAKE INVESTMENTS DO WE KNOW

00:55:49.345 --> 00:55:53.416
WHAT WHAT THAT KIND OF MOST COST

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:54.050
EFFECTIVE APPROACHES ARE. AND I

00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:55.852
DON'T I WON'T BELIEVERS THE THIS

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:58.655
WILL BE JUST BE MY PHONE POINT-

00:55:58.722 --> 00:56:00.590
DON'T WANTED THAT DON'T IMPLY AT

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:02.959
ALL- IN INTERESTING PUMPING THE

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.394
BRAKES IN FACT I'D RATHER

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.962
ACCELERATE THIS FURTHER I THINK

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.764
WE SHOULD BE DOING. MORE FOR

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.132
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS AND

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.568
HUBS- I THINK THAT WE CAN BUILD

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:13.737
ON AB EIGHT FORTY ONE AND IT'S

00:56:13.803 --> 00:56:15.839
AN ACCELERATOR GREEN SCHOOLYARDS

00:56:15.905 --> 00:56:18.108
AND SCHOOL RETROFITS PROGRAMS I

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:20.243
THINK THAT. THE WORK FORCE AND

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.611
ENFORCEMENT PIECE THE HEALTH

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:22.679
DATA SYSTEM ALL THESE ARE

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:23.980
CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT. I'D I

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:26.116
THINK. EVEN THOUGH I RECOGNIZE

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.784
TO BE SECRETARY THAT IT'S GOING

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:30.186
TO BE DIFFICULT TO SORT OF FIND

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:33.490
A SINGLE METRIC ACROSS THESE

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:34.657
SORT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. IF

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:36.392
WE CAN IDENTIFY UP FRONT HOW

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.994
MANY PEOPLE EITHER THEIR

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:41.097
WORKPLACE OR THEIR HOME. ARE

VULNERABLE TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:45.034
CLIMATE IMPACT. AND HOW MANY OF

00:56:45.101 --> 00:56:47.570
THOSE PEOPLE DO WE EXPECT THESE

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:48.938
INVESTMENTS TO MEET EITHER AT

THEIR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:53.276
RESILIENCE CENTER. AT THEIR HOME

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:54.644
WHEREVER THAT MAY BE. HOW MANY

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.579

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.256
MISSING. YEAH WELL ACTUALLY I

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.158
THINK THE ANSWER IS A LITTLE BIT

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.762
YES- CALPERS BEEN DOING- SOME

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:27.697
OUTREACH TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.265
DISTRICTS- SO THOSE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.733
CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEGUN ARE

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.903
ALSO WORKING WITH FOLKS- WITHIN

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:36.072
STATE AGENCIES IN EDUCATION- I

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.674
THINK THE BIGGER PICTURE

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.676
RESPONSE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

00:59:39.742 --> 00:59:41.678
FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE. A

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:45.448
PLACE WHERE SCHOOLS THE FUNDING

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:45.949
THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:47.850
INVESTING IS TAILORED TO THE

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:50.420
NEEDS OF SCHOOLS WHICH ARE

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:55.792
UNIQUE AND- I HAD SOMETHING THAT

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.593
WE THINK THAT. REQUIRED SOME

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.128
NUANCE AND SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.598
APPROACH TO YOU KNOW THE GRANTS

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:05.068
THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING- I

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.270
THINK ALSO JUST WANT TO FLAG

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:09.839
THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S- THERE'S

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.641
A- PARTICULAR INTEREST. IN THIS

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:13.710
PROGRAM TO BE FOCUSING ON

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:17.180
SCHOOLS THAT ARE AT THE MOST

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:19.615
VULNERABLE TO KEEP AND MANY OF

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.918
THOSE CALLS THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.987
ABOUT ARE IN- YOU KNOW LOW

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.989
INCOME COMMUNITIES WITH. NOTHING

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:29.625
BUT ASPHALT AND- SO THERE'S A

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.395
REAL NEED FOR. THE WORK THAT CAL

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:33.496
FIRE IS EXTREMELY SKILLED IN

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.465
DOING WHICH IS REMOVING THAT

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:38.101
ASPHALT REPLACING IT WITH THREE

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.636
CANOPY BUT N ADDITION AND OTHER

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.438
SORT OF GREENING ELEMENTS. THAT

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.374
SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING AND

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.310
HEALTH THAT COOL SCHOOLS AND CAN

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.545
REDUCE ENERGY COSTS. BUT ALSO

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.781
BECAUSE CAL FIRE HAS AN

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:53.916
INCREDIBLE GROUP OF TRAINED

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.552
PERFECT. URBAN FORESTERS THEY

01:00:56.619 --> 01:01:00.056
ARE EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT THE AT.

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:03.559
MAINTENANCE MANAGERS IN SCHOOL

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.927
TO DO THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.496
THAT IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:07.764
FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.099
SUCCESSFUL SO I THINK HEALTHCARE

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:11.934
IS ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT PLACE

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.536
TO START WE'RE REALLY EXCITED

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.370
THEY'RE ALSO GOING TO BE

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.539
PARTNERING VERY CLOSELY. WITH

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.841
OTHERS ACROSS OUR AGENCY I HAVE

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:21.110
DONE SOME COOL BRINGING PROJECTS

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.146
BEFORE THEY HAVE BEEN SOME SORT

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:25.381
OF. YOU KNOW ONE OFF HERE AND

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.550
THERE FIND FINAL POINT IS JUST

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.285
TO SAY WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.989
WITH- DGS AND COLLEAGUES IN THE

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.057

01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:36.092
CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS- THE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.161
DIVISION OF THE STATE ARCHITECT.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:40.396
SO THAT THOSE COUNTY ENTITIES

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.964
THAT YOU MENTIONED WILL BE

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.900
ENGAGING WITH THEM AND ENSURING

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:44.767
THAT AS WE BUILD OUT THE

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.769
GUIDELINES AND IT YOU KNOW WORK

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:47.804

AWARENESS OF THIS OF THIS

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.507
PROGRAM- THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:52.141
WORKING THROUGH THOSE CHANNELS

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:57.914
AS WELL. I JUST I. WE'VE HAD

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.382
PROBLEMS GETTING ALL THE

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.950
CALGARY. APPROACH OF OUT ON FOR

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.152
PREVENT AND FIRE WILDFIRE- WOULD

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:06.289

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:13.296
UNABLE TO DO THE- OF VEGETATION

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:14.664
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THEY'VE COULD

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.332
FIRE SEASONS BECOME A SEASON

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.602
LONG- SO. IT'S GREAT THAT THE

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:22.238

THAT WATER DAM. THAT MAINTAIN

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:38.421
THEM SO IT IS GREAT TO PLAN TO

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.056
SPEND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.691

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.547
CRITICAL ROLE IN REMOVING AND

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:19.782
STORING CARBON FROM THE

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.550
ATMOSPHERE. AND WHAT OUR

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:23.185
LANDSCAPES ARE HEALTHY THEY

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.321

EXPECT THE FUNDING- WHETHER THIS

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.945
IS REALLY MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.814
NEXT TO PROGRAMS TO KEEP THAT

WHICH PROGRAMS ARE ARE BETTER AT

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:26.662
DOING THAT. AT HOW CLOSE IS.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:27.963
THIRTY BY THIRTY EXAMPLE AND

SOME OF THE PRO THAT ARE IN

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.741
EFFECT ARE REALLY MORE

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:40.709
THEMSELVES ONE TIME FUNDING THAT

OTHERS SO WE JUST WANT TO

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:42.911
HIGHLIGHT IS WHY- FORGET

SOMETHING LIKE ACQUISITION OF OR

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.781
EASEMENT THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.816
FOR OUT OF YOUR TO YOUR PACKAGE

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.451
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS LIKE CRAZY

01:14:49.518 --> 01:14:50.118
FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S PROPOSED THE

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:54.389
FUNDING IS FUNDED AS PART OF.

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:56.625
THIS PACKAGE- THE THING IS IT'S

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:58.227

FROM. IT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:06.235
ACTIVITY SELF THINKING ABOUT.

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:07.769
THAT THAT MAKE THEM SENSE IN OF

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.939
AT TWO YEAR. AND WE WOULD ALSO-

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.608

THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.713
MILLION IT IS INEXPLICABLE SO

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:18.347
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT LOGISTICS

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:20.249
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT-

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:21.049
ABSTRACTING ITS OVERALL BURKE

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.451

OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:33.061
FUNDED IN THE PAST. FROM THE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.897
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND-

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.331
AND CERTAINLY THAT THE FUNDING

01:15:36.398 --> 01:15:38.267
SOURCE THAT COULD BE USED-

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:40.802
EITHER TO FIND SOME OF THESE-

01:15:40.869 --> 01:15:42.137

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:51.947
WHAT'S FUNDED IN THIS PACKAGE AS

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.515
WELL AS WHAT FIND IT ELSEWHERE

EXTREME HEAT CONVERSATION BUT I

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:00.889
THINK IT'S ALSO VERY RELEVANT

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:03.592
HERE ON NATURE BASED RIGHT- A

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.093
LOT OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.895
MISTER JEFF. THAT NEATLY IN ONE.

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.398
ONE AND YOU KNOW BUCKETS- SO FOR

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:11.767

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:15.103
PROGRAM THAT ALSO FUNDED IN THE-

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.772
WELFARE PACKAGE RIGHT THE ONE.

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:17.739
IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.641
TRICKY I THINK FOR THE

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.742
LEGISLATURE GET. YOU KNOW

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.144
FOREVER TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.445
OKAY LOOK THINKING HOLISTICALLY

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:24.346
ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE'S

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.580
SPENDING OTHER PACKAGES IN OTHER

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:35.090
PLACES. AS WELL. AND JUST ALSO

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:37.359
WANTED NOTE THAT A LACK OF HIM.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.293
TO CHINA ON SOME OF THE PIECES

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.662
THIS PASS- ALSO HAD A COUPLE

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:42.431
EXAMPLE AND WE- ABOUT THAT.

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:43.098
MILLION FOR TRIED. AND ACTIVISTS

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.267
CERTAINLY SEEM REASON. TO AND-

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.802
SOME FUN. TO ADDRESS AND HOW IN

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:49.438
JUST. THAT HAVE BEEN HERE SICK-

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:50.105
I THINK ONE OF THE TWO. BILL

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.440
UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY HOW THOSE

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:52.774
FUNDS BE USED WE HAVE YOUR- THAT

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:55.610
IS- PROPOSED BE. RESPECTFOR TO

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:56.578
BE THIS TRAVEL I PROCESS- BUT

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:58.580
THE SIMPLE. SPECIFIC FOR HOW

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:01.416
THOSE FUNDS USED- YOU KNOW IT

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:03.919
COULD MEMORIALIZE THOSE- SO THAT

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:05.620
WOULD HELP. YOU KNOW HELP ENSURE

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:07.289
THAT WHATEVER BOTH LEGISLATURE

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:09.725
HAS. R. G. SIMILARLY FOR EXAMPLE

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.660
WITH A FIRE WILD. LIFE

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.395
CONSERVATION BOARD FINDING IT

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:14.396
COULD GO TO SUPPORT SIX

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.631
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. ON THE BOARD

01:17:16.698 --> 01:17:17.866
WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF ALLOCATING

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:19.601
THOSE FUNDS LEGISLATURE COULD

01:17:19.668 --> 01:17:20.569
JUST. THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.037
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT THE FROM

01:17:22.104 --> 01:17:23.705
THE TRADE OFF. GIVE THEM MORE

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:24.306
FLEXIBILITY BUT- THAT MAYBE

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:25.807
DOESN'T ENSURE THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:27.509
HAS QUITE AS MUCH CONTROL. AND

01:17:27.576 --> 01:17:29.411
FINALLY WE NOTE THAT UNLIKE THE

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.746
OTHER PACKAGE THIS PACKAGE LIKE

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:31.713
THE COUNTY BILLION REPORTING

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.682
MEASURES. WE THINK THAT'S A

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.317
REALLY IMPORTANT SO THAT WE CAN

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.752
YOU KNOW AFTER THE FACT. COMPARE

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:39.054

DID WE LEARN ESPECIALLY FOR THE

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:46.795
PILOT YOUR KEY PIECES THAT ARE

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:47.662
PILOT PROJECTS- SO THOSE ARE

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:48.864
SOME. REALLY PRETTY PROBABLY

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.065
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AREAS TO

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:51.733
HAVE THAT KIND OF REPORTING. BUT

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.368
JUST GENERALLY WE THINK IT'S

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:53.902
IMPORTANT TO HAVE ROBUST

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:56.004
REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY-

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:57.105

GONNA BE FOR TRIBAL CORPS WHAT.

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:30.539
WOULD THEY BE DEFERRED DOING

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.707
DIFFERENT THAN THE REGULAR COURT

01:18:32.774 --> 01:18:35.077
IN THIS AREA OF NATURE BASED

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:38.413
SOLUTIONS WHAT WOULD BE. THEN

01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.646
WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:21.850
THE- YOU CITY WILL BE LED BY.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:29.124
TRIBAL PEOPLE. OR THEY WOULD. SO

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.058
CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.361
TRIBES WOULD BE- DEVELOPING

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.829
THESE CORES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:36.097
THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.866
CORPS AND SO THERE WOULD BE A

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.634
FOCUS ON TRIBAL NATURE BASED

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.437
SOLUTIONS PRIORITIES- THERE'D BE

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:43.572
A FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:48.009
ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE- AND ALSO-

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:49.811
SUPPORTING THE STATEWIDE EFFORTS

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.580
IN THE NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS TO

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:53.815
YOU KNOW JUST OUT A BURSTING IN

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:56.518
THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND SO YOU'LL

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:57.419
BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TRAVEL

01:20:57.485 --> 01:21:01.756
USE. TO LEARN THE SKILLS THAT TO

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:02.791
HAVE THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT-

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.459
BUT ALSO LEARN FROM TRIBAL

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.461
LEADERS AND- CULTURAL

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:09.097
PRACTITIONERS AND- AND YOU GAIN

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.799
THOSE SKILLS AS WELL THAT ARE

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.634
IMPORTANT FOR NATIVE PEOPLE AND

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:17.772
NATIVE. COMMUNITIES OF OKAY I

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:19.841
GET I GET THAT THE TRIBAL BE

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:20.942
ENTERED THE END THE AND THAT

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.545
THAT PART OF IT I GOT IT I

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:24.512
DON'T. UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:25.914
WORK BEING DIFFERENT BUT- THAT'S

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.749
PROPOSAL- LET'S SEE MY

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:29.784
COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS ON THE

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:32.921
NATURE BASED- OUR- PROPOSAL-

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:36.725
CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:40.161
CHAIR- REPEAT A SIMILAR THEME TO

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:42.664
THE LAST TIME WHICH IS-

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.332
SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:46.868
ADMINISTRATION- PUTTING FORWARD

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:49.337
SOME. SOME PRACTICAL AND VERY

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:51.640
WELL GROUNDED SOLUTIONS AND

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.208
DIGGING IN DEEP ON OUR

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:55.744
BIODIVERSITY CRISIS ON OUR

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:58.146
THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS- AND I

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:00.815
WOULD JUST ECHO AGAIN- I THINK

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.884
WE CAN GO EVEN BIGGER. AND

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:05.687
YOU'LL SEE THAT REFLECTED IN

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:07.289
WITH THE SENATE'S PROPOSED AND

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.624
I'M HOPING THAT WE- CONTINUE TO

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:10.892
BE AMBITIOUS ON THIS CRITICAL

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.628
PIECE OF OUR OF OUR CLIMATE

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:17.699
PACKAGE- I'M WONDERING IF TWO

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:21.269
QUESTIONS- HOW FOR TOWARDS OUR

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.805
GOAL- GOALS DO YOU THINK THIS

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:26.207
WILL GET US. AND WHAT WHAT ARE

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:33.014
THOSE THOSE GOALS AT THIS POINT. I'VE BEEN GOVERNOR AGAIN

01:22:33.081 --> 01:22:34.983
THANKS FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:36.384
THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION TO

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.620
ANSWER WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.188
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE ANALYSIS

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:42.090
AND IT'S CHALLENGING AND I CAN

01:22:42.157 --> 01:22:43.358
TELL YOU ONE OF THE REASONS AS

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:46.061
THIS- YOU KNOW. ACQUISITIONS AND

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.929
EASEMENTS IS ONE PIECE OF OUR

01:22:47.996 --> 01:22:50.265
OVERALL STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.901
THIRTY BY THIRTY- SO A LOT OF

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:55.270
THIS FUNDING WILL HELP US WITH

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.104
THAT THROUGH THE WILDLIFE

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.872
CONSERVATION BOARD AS WELL AS

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:00.709
THROUGH CONSERVANCY- BUT AS YOU

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.677
KNOW YOU KNOW THE COST OF

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:04.813
ACQUISITION THEY'RE EVEN IF. A

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:07.315
HIGHLY VARIABLE ACROSS THE STATE

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.683
AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.486
HOW MANY ACRES PER DOLLAR YOU

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.789
CAN COUNT ON- AND AS YOU KNOW IN

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:17.726
FOR VERSUS- EVEN THOSE HAVE

01:23:17.792 --> 01:23:19.060
WIDELY DIFFERENT COSTS SO IT'S

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:19.894
DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH THOSE

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.663
ACRES IN TERMS OF GETTING HOW

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.732
WILL GET US CLOSER TO THIRTY BY

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.567
THIRTY. I WILL ALSO POINT OUT

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:26.134
THAT WE EXPECT THE FEDERAL

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:29.838
GOVERNMENT TO- CONTRIBUTE A FAIR

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:31.072
AMOUNT OF THIS RICH OUR GOAL I

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:33.141
DIDN'T AT. CURRENT TIME THERE'S

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.643
ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF ACRES

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:36.578
BETTER IN FEDERAL PROCESS THAT

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:38.046
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR OVERALL

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:39.714
GOAL. AGAIN THERE ARE MULTIPLE

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.950
PATHWAYS IN THIS IS JUST ONE-

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:44.352
BUT I THINK IT'LL MAKE A

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:45.987
SIGNIFICANT DOWNPAYMENT. AND IF

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.055
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO ADD

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:49.090
SOMETHING. YES I WOULD JUST ADD

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:52.394
THAT. YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THAT

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.596
BASED ON THE MODELING THAT

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:56.364
CARBON IS DONE AND THEY'RE SORT

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:59.167
OF VERY FIRST INITIAL- ATTEMPT

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:00.301
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE SOURCES

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:02.837
AND THINGS OF OUR LANDS. WILL BE

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.974
IN THE FUTURE. AT THAT.

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.143
UNPRECEDENTED CLIMATE SMARTLY

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.378
AND MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED IN

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:13.214
CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO GET TO

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:15.116
CARBON NEUTRALITY AND YOUR LONG

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:16.217
TERM GLOBAL CLIMATE

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.720
STABILIZATION GOALS. SO AT WELL

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.455
I CAN'T NECESSARILY ANSWER THE

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.056
QUESTION. OF SORT OF

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.792
SPECIFICALLY HOW FAR WILL THIS

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:26.628
PACKAGE GET US. I CAN'T SAY THAT

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.029
IT IS CRITICAL TO BEGIN

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:30.398
INVESTING NOW AND TO CONTINUE

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:34.369
TO. MEASURE THE IMPACTS WHETHER

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:35.870
THOSE BE YOU KNOW THE KIND OF

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.806
RESULTS IMPACTS BUT IN

01:24:37.872 --> 01:24:40.175
PARTICULAR. AT THE EMISSIONS AS

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:43.645
THE CLUSTERED OR AS- WE MOVED

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:45.346
THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IN ORDER

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:47.549
TO ENSURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:49.717
REALLY ARE DRIVING CREDIBLE. AB

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:53.588
KIND OF BENEFITS. IT DID TO ME

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:56.391
WHAT IS CLEARLY A AT. AS HUGE OF

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.461
WORK AHEAD OF US IN THE SPACE.

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:01.229
M. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:03.064
DIDN'T I MEAN I DIDN'T MEAN TO

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.633
IMPLY THAT. THAT ACREAGE OUGHT

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:08.470
TO BE THE SOLE METRIC OR OR THE

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:11.306
GOAL AND TO BE SECRETARY HANSEN

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:15.477
I MEAN YOU NOTED CARBON- I THINK

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:18.346
YOU KNOW BIODIVERSITY IS NOT

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:19.981
NECESSARILY ONLY DICTATED BY.

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.016
TOTAL NUMBER OF ACRES YOU COULD

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.084
CONSERVE. MILLIONS OF ACRES IN

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:24.652
THE WRONG AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:27.188
NO SENSITIVITIES AROUND YOU KNOW

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:29.023
SPECIES DECLINE AND YOU ACTUALLY

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:30.158
WOULDN'T IMPROVE YOUR

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.026
BIODIVERSITY RESILIENCE ANY

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:35.497
FURTHER SO. WHICH ACRES THEY ARE

01:25:35.563 --> 01:25:36.965
MATTERS AND IN SOME WAYS SMALL

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.633
SMALL PROJECTS CAN YIELD HUGE

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.602
REWARDS LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.403
BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY WHICH

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.806
IS TINY IN ITS FOOTPRINT. BUT

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:47.041
CAN HAVE MASSIVE EFFECTS.

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:49.644
IMPROVING THAT ESTUARY- FINDING

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.845
BIRD HABITAT IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:53.081
THE METROPOLIS- AS WELL AS THE

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:54.782
SORT EQUITY GOALS THAT I THINK

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:57.619
SHOULD SHOULD BE DRIVING ALL OF

01:25:57.685 --> 01:25:59.754
OUR WORK HERE- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:02.657
UNDERLYING ACCESS GOALS- ACCESS

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:04.492
TO WILD OPEN SPACES ON THESE

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.327
THINGS MATTER TO I'M SIMPLY

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.129
SUGGESTING THAT WE START TO

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.532
ARTICULATE THOSE- IN THE THIRTY

01:26:10.598 --> 01:26:12.600
BY THIRTY PROCESS AND I KNOW YOU

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.303
GUYS HAVE ALREADY PUT OUT YOUR-

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:15.870
INITIAL PLANNING DOCUMENT-

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:16.504
FOLLOWING UP AND- WE SUBMITTED

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:18.206
COMMENTS ON THAT. ON BEHALF THE

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.641
RESOURCE COMMITTEE OF A NUMBER

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:21.709
OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS- BUT ON

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:23.745
THIS THAT SORT OF ACREAGE POINT.

01:26:23.811 --> 01:26:25.847
CONCEDING THAT IT OUGHT NOT

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.515
MAYBE BE OUR CENTRAL METRIC BUT

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.651
AT LEAST SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.185
TRACKING AND STUDYING AS WE GO

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.821
WAS THERE ANY- CONSIDERATION IN

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:36.558
TERMS OF TOTAL ACREAGE- UNDER

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:40.328
MANAGEMENT OR- THE SORT OF SCOPE

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.497
OF WHAT. EACH CONSERVANCY HAS ON

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:45.500
ITS PLATE- WHEN THE BREAK DOWN

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.336
OF THE REGIONAL THAT REGIONALLY

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.271
SUPPORTIVE ACTIONS WAS LAID OUT

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:53.808
I NOTICED THAT IT'S SORT OF.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.510
EVEN ACROSS. A NUMBER OF

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:57.879
CONSERVANCIES AND I JUST WANTED

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.881
TO GET A SENSE OF. OF YOUR LOGIC

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:02.083
THERE I MEAN I JUST BY WAY OF

01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:03.851
COMPARISON- YOU KNOW SANTA

01:27:03.918 --> 01:27:04.719
MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.688
SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY SAN

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.956
GABRIEL LOWER L. A. RIVER AND

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.857
SAN DIEGO ALL HAVE THE SAME

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:12.594
PROPOSED. ALLOCATION WHICH IS

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.462
ELEVEN POINT ONE MILLION

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.763
DOLLARS- PER YEAR OVER TWO YEARS

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:17.832
TO GET TO TWENTY TWO POINT TWO

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.368
AND THEN THAT ADDS UP- SANTA

01:27:20.435 --> 01:27:21.502
MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY.

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:24.906
I'M OVERSEAS ABOUT SEVENTY TWO

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.341
THOUSAND ACRES IN THEIR THEIR

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:29.110
PLAN THAT THEY'VE TARGETED FOR

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.645
CONSERVATION. SAN GABRIEL HAS

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:32.914
BUT TWO THOUSAND SO ABOUT THIRTY

01:27:32.981 --> 01:27:34.716
SIX TIMES LESS THAN THAT AND IN

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:36.484
SAN DIEGO HAS TWO HUNDRED TIMES

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:37.986
LESS THAN THAT WITH. JUST THREE

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.754
OR SEVENTY FIVE ACRES TARGETED

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.489
FOR. IN THEIR CONSERVATION

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:45.393
PLANNING SO- HOW DID THAT HOW

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:47.528
DID YOU SORT OF WAY THE SCOPE OF

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:50.598
WORK. THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING-

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:51.699
THESE OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO BE

01:27:51.766 --> 01:27:54.502
DOING ON YOUR ON YOUR REGIONAL

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.939
ACTION PROPOSAL. I THINK THAT

01:27:58.006 --> 01:28:00.108
QUESTION I WOULD SAY- YOU KNOW

01:28:00.174 --> 01:28:01.743
FUNDAMENTALLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:03.711
REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP IS

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.313

ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS WE

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:47.368
BELIEVE THAT MORE MONEY SHOULD

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:50.037
GO INTO THE THIRTY BY THIRTY. OF

01:31:50.104 --> 01:31:52.440
THAT MONEY AT LEAST HALF OF IT.

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:53.674
EVERYWHERE BUT WE HAVE A BREAK

KNOWING WHAT THE QUALITY THE

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:20.334
QUANTITY RATIO IS GOING TO BE SO

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:23.504
IF YOU COULD JUST. I KNOW. WE'RE

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:25.273

BEST BE SPENT IN THIS QUALITY

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:41.389
QUANTITY. RACIAL GIVEN THAT WE

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:45.526
SIXTY EIGHT ALREADY FORCING

KNOW THE QUANTITY VERSUS QUALITY

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:51.933
QUESTION I THINK IS A REALLY

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:53.834
IMPORTANT ONE AND THAT IS

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:55.636
ACTUALLY WHY WE CREATED THIS.

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.471
AMONG THE REFERENCE THAT CA

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.874
NATURE WHICH IS OUR ONLINE

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:01.342
INTERACTIVE MAPPING AND

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.743
VISUALIZATION TOOLS THIS IS

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:05.246
ACTUALLY- INTERACTIVE MAP THAT

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:07.181
ANYBODY IN THE STATE CAN-

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:10.117
ACCESS. AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE

01:33:10.184 --> 01:33:11.953
USER FRIENDLY OR IF YOU'RE A

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:14.188
REALLY TECHNICALLY CAPABLE- THAT

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.324
PERSON TO USE OTHERS MULTIPLE

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.459
SORT OF. LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY BUT

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.394
ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AND SEE WHERE

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.096
WE ACTUALLY HAVE CONJURATION

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:24.565
ALREADY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.300
COMPARE THAT TO. BIODIVERSITY

01:33:26.367 --> 01:33:29.170
HOT SPOTS PLACES WHERE YOU CAN-

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:30.471
ADD CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:33.474
EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS LOOK AT

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.376
HOW THOSE PLACES WILL- BE

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.644
IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.746
MOVING FORWARD SO- CHANGES IN

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:39.947
TEMPERATURE CHANGES IN

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.782
PRECIPITATION. THERE'S ANOTHER

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:44.051
YOU CAN USE A LAYER TO LOOK AT

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:46.053
WHERE WE HAVE A LITTLE ACCESS TO

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.755
NATURE. SO WHERE ARE OTHER

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:49.557
PLACES THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE

01:33:49.623 --> 01:33:50.891
ACCESS TO NATURE SO YOU CAN USE

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:53.928
THAT TOOL. TO OUR SUITE OF TOOLS

01:33:53.995 --> 01:33:56.664
REALLY TO IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.399
QUALITY INVESTMENTS THAT WE CAN

MAKE. TO AND SO IT DIFFICULT

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:02.370
BENEFIT WIDE LEVEL BUT EACH SORT

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:07.408
REGION HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.676
GET THE MOST FOR THEIR BUCK HALF

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.778
I JUST NOTE THAT THE- THIS.

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:11.979

CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT DOES

01:43:58.498 --> 01:43:59.566
NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. I

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.935

01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:50.536
PROPOSAL'S BEING FUNDED ON A

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:52.638
REIMBURSEMENT BASIS SO IT

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:55.408
WOULDN'T BE FUNDED FROM ANY OF.

01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:57.243
THE FEES AND TAXES THAT SUPPORTS

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:59.178
DTS USE NORMAL ACTIVITIES SO

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.947
FUNDING WOULD COME DIRECTLY FROM

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:03.216
I'M RESPONSIBLE PARTIES- I

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:04.784
GUESS. THE FUNDING IS LIMITED

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:07.653
TERM IN NATURE BUT- ONCE CLEAN

01:57:09.455 --> 01:57:11.157
ARE ARE. FULLY REALIZED I THINK

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.825
THAT'S ONE FUNDING WOULD WOULD-

01:57:12.892 --> 01:57:14.827
TRIGGER OFF- BUT I WOULD FOR

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.229

COLLECTED LAST YEAR SO THERE'D

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:27.473
BE. I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.675
LACKS A NUMBER OF TOXIC SITES

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.177
THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AT

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:33.346
THE END TO DO IT I GUESS THAT'S

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:37.417
MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS. THE

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:38.184

C. IN THE EPA USING TO CLAIM.

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:40.399
THAT THIS IS THE- STRICTEST

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:43.769
POSSIBLE CLEANUP STANDARD. THANK

FOREMOST FOR DIGGING IN IT IT IS

INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT.

02:00:49.875 --> 02:00:52.078
EVERYBODY HAVE FAITH IN YOU IN

02:00:52.144 --> 02:00:53.813
THIS AGREEMENT AND THEN WHAT WE

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:56.148
WERE GOING TO REQUIRE BOWING TO

02:00:56.215 --> 02:00:58.184
DO WE- THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:59.785
IMPACTED BY THE SIDE AND LIVE IN

02:00:59.852 --> 02:01:02.488
THE SHADOW OF IT DESERVE NOTHING

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:03.990
LESS SO. YOU ASK ABOUT THE

02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:06.459
CLEANUP STANDARDS AND I DO NEED

02:01:06.525 --> 02:01:09.562
TO BE CLEAR THAT WE HAVE NOT.

02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:11.364
ESTABLISHED A CLEANUP STANDARD

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.798
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT DONE WE'LL

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.700
SEE FOR SO WE ANTICIPATE

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.569
APPLYING THE MOST RIGOROUS

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.704
STANDARD POSSIBLE THE SITE. BUT

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:20.539
THAT CLEANUP STANDARD WON'T BE

02:01:20.606 --> 02:01:22.775
FINAL UNTIL WE CERTIFY THE

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:25.244
PROGRAM VARMINT IMPACT REPORT

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:27.146
LATER THIS YEAR. BUT IT IS OUR

02:01:27.213 --> 02:01:29.248
GOAL TO REQUIRE BOWING TO CLEAN

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:32.852
UP TO WHAT WE CALL A RESIDENT

02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.120
BEFORE YOU KNOW. AND WHEN WE

02:01:34.186 --> 02:01:36.222
TALK ABOUT IT AS THE STRICTEST.

02:01:36.288 --> 02:01:38.057
WE'RE REFERENCING THE TWO

02:01:38.124 --> 02:01:40.292
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN CENTRAL. AND

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:41.994
ALTHOUGH THAT WATER DIDN'T

02:01:42.061 --> 02:01:45.131
SPECIFICALLY. DIDN'T SPECIFY A

02:01:45.197 --> 02:01:48.334
STANDARD OUTLINED A RANGE OF

02:01:48.401 --> 02:01:51.570
POSSIBLE EXPOSURES. A RECREATION

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:54.940
OR STAND A RESIDENTIAL STAND- A

02:01:55.007 --> 02:01:57.710
RESIDENTIAL SCENARIO- A

02:01:57.777 --> 02:01:58.878
RESIDENTS TO DIFFERENT

02:01:58.944 --> 02:02:00.913
RESIDENTIAL SCENARIOS WHERE

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:02.114
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE GARDENS IN

02:02:02.181 --> 02:02:04.617
THEIR BACKYARDS AND ALL OF THOSE

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:07.453
SCENARIOS A RESIDENT WITH A 100%

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.122
GARDEN SCENARIO DOES PRODUCE THE

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:13.793
MOST STRINGENT CLEAN UP AND

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:14.860
THAT'S WHAT THE AGREEMENT CALLS

02:02:14.927 --> 02:02:16.729
FOR. NORMALLY WE SET OUR RISK

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:18.264
BASED STANDARDS BASED ON LAND

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:20.933
USE AND WE WOULD TYPICALLY APPLY

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:22.635
RESIDENTIAL CLEANUP STANDARD TO

02:02:22.702 --> 02:02:24.603
THE SITE BUT OF COURSE WE WANT

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:27.073
TO ENSURE EVEN MORE PROTECTIONS

02:02:27.139 --> 02:02:29.408
IN ANTICIPATION. OF POTENTIAL

02:02:29.475 --> 02:02:31.610
FUTURE LAND USE AND IN LIGHT OF

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:33.846
THE EXTENSIVE CONTAMINATION AT

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:37.183
THE SITE SO. I JUST FIVE POINT

02:02:37.249 --> 02:02:39.085
OF REFERENCE A RESIDENT WITH

02:02:39.151 --> 02:02:41.120
GARDEN CLEANUP STANDARD HAS ONLY

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:43.489
BEEN USED IN JUST A HANDFUL OF

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:46.125
SITES AROUND THE STATE. AND I

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:47.860
WAS VERY HEARTENED TO SEE THAT

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:48.961
STANDARD AND THAT'S WHAT WE IN

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:50.663
THE COMMUNITY BEEN ASKING FOR A

02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:53.365
VERY LONG TIME JUST WHAT THE

02:02:53.432 --> 02:02:54.633
METHODOLOGY IS TO ARRIVE AT THAT

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.868
RESIDENTIAL GARDEN STANDARD I

02:02:55.935 --> 02:02:57.436
THINK IS EVERYTHING THE DEVILS

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:59.238
IN THOSE DETAILS- CAN YOU

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:03.976
COMMENT ON. THE CONCERN AROUND-

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.010
THIS STANDARDIZED RISK

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:07.346
ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY- A YOU

02:03:07.413 --> 02:03:08.881
YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN YOUR

02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:11.217
OPENING REMARKS BUT HAS THE HAS

02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:14.653
THAT- THE ACRONYM IS THE

02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.890
CERAMBYCIDAE SERAM BEEN. ALTERED

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:22.128
TO FIT. THEM THIS THIS CLEAN UP

02:03:22.194 --> 02:03:26.365
AGREEMENT. SO AS YOU WILL HOLD

02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:29.068
THE IT IS A COMPLEX CLEAN AND SO

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:31.237
THE SCHRAM WILL STANDARDIZE RISK

02:03:31.303 --> 02:03:33.472
ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY WAS

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:34.940
DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE VERY

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:36.609
SPECIFIC DETAILS OF BOEING ABOUT

02:03:36.675 --> 02:03:39.311
HOW TO PERFORM. AND APPLY A RISK

02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:43.249
BASED CLEAN UP AT SFO. AND SO WE

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:45.017
NEEDED TO DOCUMENT THIS

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:46.152
METHODOLOGY BECAUSE AS I

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.020
HIGHLIGHTED A RESIDENT WITH

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:50.723
GARDENS STANDARD IS NOT NOT

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:52.958
WIDELY USED. SO THE METHODS

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:55.895
OUTLINED IN THE SCHRAM HAVE

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:58.364
REMAINED THE SAME. WHAT DGSE

02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.599
ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:02.768
USING AUTHORITATIVE VALUES AND

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:05.604
GUIDE. AND IN THIS CASE WE ARE

02:04:05.671 --> 02:04:07.373
USING VLUES IN GUIDANCE THAT IS

02:04:07.439 --> 02:04:10.242
CURATED AND UPDATED ON A REGULAR

02:04:10.309 --> 02:04:12.411
BASIS. SO THE SCHRAMM WHO NEEDS

02:04:12.478 --> 02:04:13.946
TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THOSE

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:16.582
CHANGES. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:04:16.649 --> 02:04:18.918
IS YOU YOU DID NOT UPDATE THIS

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:20.786
RAM TO ACCOMMODATE- AND THEN GO

02:04:20.853 --> 02:04:22.555
OVER THE AGREEMENT BUT THAT.

02:04:22.621 --> 02:04:25.591
IT'S OUT OF ITS IT DOESN'T IT'S

02:04:25.658 --> 02:04:27.593
NOT CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT EPA

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:29.695
GUIDANCE IS THAT THAT. NOT QUITE

02:04:29.762 --> 02:04:32.464
THE OPPOSITE OKAY WE DIDN'T WE

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:36.602
DIDN'T- NO MODIFY THE SCHRAMM TO

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.838
REFLECT TO TRY TO GET TO AN

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:40.039
ANSWER WE DIDN'T PREDETERMINE

02:04:40.105 --> 02:04:43.342
AND ANSWER THEM BACK INTO IT BUT

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.810
NOT BY ANY MEANS- BUT YES THIS

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:46.545
IS FULLY CONSISTENT WITH U. S.

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:48.681
EPA GUIDE AND I IN FACT THEY USE

02:04:48.747 --> 02:04:50.983
A VERY SIMILAR PROCESS WHEN THEY

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.919
USE THEIR RECENT RESEARCH-

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:57.189
CALCULATORS. IN THAT THE BIG

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:58.958
POINTS AS TO AFFORD HATED

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:01.794
DATABASES AND DATA SOURCES AND

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:04.296
USE WHATEVER DATA ARE PUBLISHED

02:05:04.363 --> 02:05:05.798
IN THOSE DATABASES AND DATA

02:05:05.865 --> 02:05:08.234
SOURCES AT A GIVEN TIME AND SO

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.369
THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:11.804
DOING IS WE'RE REFLECTING THE

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:14.340
UPDATES TO BOOK AND GUIDANCE AND

02:05:14.406 --> 02:05:18.677
ANY SOURCE DATA TO GO INTO THE

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:21.914
TRAP. AND I AM CALCULATIONS VERY

02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:24.850
CALM AND I HAVE TO JUST SAY YOU

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:27.152
KNOW I'M A PHD PHYSICIST I DON'T

02:05:27.219 --> 02:05:28.687
USE MY SCIENTIFIC CHOPS EVERY

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:30.756
DAY IN MY WORK BUT THIS IS AN

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:33.092
EXCEPTION IN THIS CASE I DID

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:34.793
VERY DEEP INTO THE INTO THE

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.929
CALCULATIONS UNTIL I WAS

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:38.731
CONFIDENT THAT THE WORK WHICH

02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:39.732
THEN THE WORK OF OUR

02:05:39.798 --> 02:05:41.533
TOXICOLOGISTS AND I WAS

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.236
CONFIDENT IN THE METHODS AND WE

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:45.905
WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WALK

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:48.741
YOU THROUGH THE CALCULATIONS AND

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.676
WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:52.211
AND WE WANT EVERYONE TRAXXAS

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:54.280
CLEAN UP TO BE CONFIDENT THAT

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:55.514
WE'RE INSURING A HIGHLY

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:57.016
PRODUCTIVE ENOUGH SO. WE'LL

02:05:57.082 --> 02:05:58.884
CONTINUE TO MAKE THE BEST

02:05:58.951 --> 02:06:01.453
SUPPORTING INFORMATION THAT

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:04.590
LEADS TO THAT SO THAT WAS- ABOUT

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:06.659
THE SCHRAM AVAILABLE CAN I JUST

02:06:06.725 --> 02:06:11.597
SO JUST. TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.465
THE- THIS TO JUST TO MAKE WHAT

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.034
YOU'RE SAYING IS VERY COMPLEX AS

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.202
SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR MYSELF

02:06:17.269 --> 02:06:19.438
AND FOR ALL THE CONSTITUENTS

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:22.274
LISTENING- I UNDERSTAND THIS

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:25.711
GETS DOWN TO HOW MUCH TOXICITY.

02:06:25.778 --> 02:06:29.782
CAN BE UP TAKE IN SAY. A TOMATO

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:31.283
PLANT OR WHATEVER YOU MAY BE

02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:32.952
GROWING IN THAT GARDEN SUCH THAT

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:35.321
IF YOU CONSUME THAT FOOD THAT

02:06:35.387 --> 02:06:37.022
FRUIT WHATEVER IT WAS THAT YOU

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:38.457
WOULD. AT THROUGHOUT THE COURSE

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.059
OF YOUR LIFE I THINK THAT YOU

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:43.929
HAVE NO- FORESEEABLE RISK OF-

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:48.434
CARCINOGENIC EFFECTS SO. THE IS

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:48.934
THE DISAGREEMENT OR THE

02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:52.004
SKEPTICISM- FROM COMMUNITY

02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:55.274
ADVOCATES ABOUT. HOW MUCH THAT

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:58.210
PLANTS WILL UPTAKE- THAT THAT

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.212
SORT OF TOXIC MATERIAL ON SITE

02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:01.747
HOW MUCH WOULD ACTUALLY END UP

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:04.850
IN WHATEVER THAT TOMATO IS THAT

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:09.088
PIECE OF FRUIT. YEAH SO. YOU'RE

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.757
YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE- SO

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:15.160
THE COMBINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:16.962
CONTAMINATION THAT THAT IT WOULD

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:19.565
TAKE UP AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.400
CONTAMINATION THAT'S LEFT ON THE

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.302
PLATE SIMPLY BY. YOU KNOW HAVING

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:27.039
SOIL EVEN EVEN IF YOU WASH YOUR

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.474
PRODUCE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:30.342
TO REALLY REALLY SPEND ENSURE OR

02:07:30.409 --> 02:07:32.077
VEGETABLES THAT STILL HAVE SOME

02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:33.846
RESIDUAL SOIL SO THOSE ARE THE

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:36.982
TWO THINGS THAT ARE TO GO INTO-

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:39.284
THE CALCULATION THAT'S- TWO OF

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:41.086
THE THINGS THAT GO INTO THE

02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:42.921
CALCULATION SO YES. WHEN WE GO

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.923
AND WE LOOK AT THE GOVERNING

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:46.759
DOCUMENTS THAT SAY THIS IS HOW

02:07:46.825 --> 02:07:48.127
MUCH LETTUCE AND WE TALK ABOUT

02:07:48.193 --> 02:07:50.429
LETTERS BECAUSE LETTERS DOES

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:52.431
TEND TO TAKE UP MORE SOIL. FIRST

02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:53.966
OF ALL TAKE UP MORE

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:57.302
CONTAMINATION AND- JUST SERVICE

02:07:57.369 --> 02:08:00.839
AREA WIDE PICK OF- OBSERVE. A

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:02.808
LOT OF SOIL MIGHT ADHERE TO IT

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:06.311
SO IT'S A VERY CONSERVATIVE WAY

02:08:06.378 --> 02:08:07.546
WAY. TO DO TH CALCULATIONS SO

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:09.848
WE BASE EVERYTHING ON LETTUCE

02:08:09.915 --> 02:08:12.684
AND IN THE CASE OF LETTUCE- ONE

02:08:12.751 --> 02:08:14.653
OF THE VARIABLES ONE OF THE DATA

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:18.357
SOURCES DID CHANGE ON. OVER THE

02:08:18.424 --> 02:08:23.762
YEARS AND SO WE'RE PASSAGE.

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:27.466
