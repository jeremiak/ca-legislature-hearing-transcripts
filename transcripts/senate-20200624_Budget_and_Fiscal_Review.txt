TO CERTAIN- HI TEN FILERS AND IT EXPANDS THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM BACK TO THE SIXTY MONTHS TIME CLOCK. THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF WELFARE REFORM DONE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHICH EXISTED IN THE STATE PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION. LEARNING FROM LESSONS FROM THE LAST RECESSION IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T CUT PROGRAMS THAT ARE RESIDENTS RELY MORE HEAVILY ON DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. HOWEVER WE'RE STILL GRAPPLING WITH THE BUDGET SHORTFALL IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS IN ORDER TO RESTORE OR AUGMENT FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS INCLUDING.

AS YOU MENTIONED WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A PRETTY EXTENSIVE A JACK AND US SO WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO KEEP OUR PRESENTATIONS VERY BRIEF BUT OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. YOUR ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WE GO ALONG. SO THE FIRST AT BELL IS THAT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WHICH IS AND AMENDMENTS JUDY BUDGET ACT THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THIS PAST WEEK THIS IS B EIGHTY NINE. AND UNDER THIS BUDGET AGREEMENT- THERE OF COURSE THE REASON PROVISIONS IN EXPENDITURES. WHEN YOU SOME THEM ALL OUT- WE ARE PROJECTING THAT TOTAL GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR UNDER THIS VEIL- IF THE BUDGET WORLD TO BE SIGNED. IS A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS THE GENERAL FUND. IN ADDITION AND WE'RE PROJECTING THAT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WE WOULD STILL HAVE. RESERVES INCLUDING TWO POINT SIX BILLION GOING INTO THIS YEAR AND THE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ECONOMIC. ECONOMIC UNCERTAIN UNCERTAINTIES. WE ALSO HAVE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE'S. RESERVE HAVING WITHDRAWN FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THERE. AND WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL. POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE RAINY DAY FUND. HAVING WITHDRAWN SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UNDER THE BUDGET ACT BUT- THAT'S THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I SHOULD MENTION. IS THAT THE CHAIR DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE COURT. THAT MISSIONAL FEDERAL. AND UNDER THE BUDGET. AS WELL AS THEY CAN. SECTION LANGUAGE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT WE PUBLISHED OF MEASURES. IT'S WE RECEIVED FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITIONAL. FUNDS A SERIES OF CUTS THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO. BUDGET AS WELL AS DEFERRALS WILL BE RESTORED AND THIS INCLUDES. AN EDUCATIONAL DEFERRAL ARE DIFFERENT EXPENSES INTO THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR. IT INCLUDES- CUTS- COMPARED TO OUR JANUARY BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY F CALIFORNIA. AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. IT INCLUDES- HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR CUT TO COURTS AND DERES OTHER PROGRAMS. THAT ARE INDUSTRY- RELATE. SO WE ARE HOPING. THAT WE WILL SEE. ALL FORTY MILLION PERCENT. BY OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWELVE. AT AND IF. RECEIVED AN AMOUNT THE FEDERAL. THAT IS LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT. AND SUMMIT. BECAUSE YOUR PARTIAL. BASIS SO THAT'S THE. OVERALL FREE MARK THE BUDGET BELT BUT TO TAKE ANY. AS ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR Y. QUE. WHAT PLAN IF WE GET LATER OCT FIFTH NO FIRST NOW TWO SEVEN DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THOSE TRIGGERS. SO BASICALLY AT THAT POINT WE WOULD HAVE THAT COUPLE OF OPTIONS SO UNDER THE- BUDGET LANGUAGE YOU ARE CORRECTED THAT AND A CONTROLLING WHICH ONLY APPLIES TO FIND SO SHE'S. COVERED FIFTEEN SO AFTER THAT BASICALLY ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR HOW YOU COULD DEAL WITH THAT- ONE OPTION WOULD BE IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE FISCAL PICTURE FOR THE YEAR AFTER THIS COMING YEAR. IS LOOKING AT NOT AS HOPEFUL AS WE EXPECT. THAT MONEY COULD SIMPLY REDUCE THE DEFICIT THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE BE FACING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AT UP PERHAPS FISCAL YEAR IS VERY BRIGHT AND WE MADE A LOT OF CAR PRESS. ENTER THE RIVER I CAN RECOVERY. MAGIC BUT THAT'S FINDING BEING YOU FOR COOPER YOUR PROGRAMS AND TO FINALLY IF THERE IS AN URGENT NEED ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S WE ARE SESSION I IN THOSE MONTHS THAT YOU MENTIONED. YOU CAN MATCH AND- YOU KNOW IT ANOTHER CASES THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER SESSIONS WHERE PEOPLE COME INTO THE MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES BUT THAT'S ALL LONG WAY SAYS IT WOULD BE OPTION LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WORKING TOGETHER AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THE ACTUAL. A DISH QUESTIONS. SEEN NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES WILL MOVE ON TO AB SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION THE SERVICE WHEN OFTEN. YES THIS IS THE ARMY BUS TRAILER BILL OUT RELATED TO K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION AND I ALSO HAVE MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOMES ON THE LINE WHO CAN SPEAK TO QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT SOME OF THE KEY HIGHLIGHTS HERE THERE'S A LOT IN HERE SO I'LL JUST MENTION JUST A COUPLE POINTS. THE FIRST IS THE OVERALL WEB THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WHICH WE ARE PROJECTING FOR THE COMING YEAR SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S OF COURSE CASE FOR FOURTEEN. APPLE BUT IT'S IN. TO NOTE. AS WE'RE DISCUSSING EDUCATION IN THIS BUDGET- THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL SIGNS BEYOND PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES. THAT ARE SUPPORTING DUCATION ESPECIALLY AS WE ENTER A VERY UNCERTAIN. WHEN IT COMES TO YOU AT SINCE THE FALL AND THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS AND MITIGATING MORNING LOS. THIS INCLUDES FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CORONA VIRUS FOR WE FIND THIS WAS THE- FLEXIBLE FINDING. THAT WE GOT FROM THE CARES ACTIVE WHICH CALIFORNIA AT THE STATE LEVEL WAS ALLOCATED NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS ARE PROVIDED FOR FEDERAL LEGISLATION. AND I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WHILE AT THESE EXPENDITURES ARE FOR THE COMING YEAR. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A COMMITMENT STARTING IN THE YEAR AFTER THE COMING YEAR. TO RESTORE ADDITIONAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BASS FINDING A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AND THIS WOULD BE BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. OF STATUTORY CORPORATION THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE IS. YEAR HELP. OUR WE ARE STORED BE PROP NINETY EIGHT DAYS AND- RAY. REVENGE AT FORTY PER. HAVE JENNA FUND A TEST YEAR. THE ALSO. DAIRY OTHER PRINT. FOR TO HARM FOR EIGHTY EIGHT AS WELL AS GUIDANCE ON ATTENDANCE AND RE OPENING- AND WE KNOW IT'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS REGARDING HOW THAT WILL WORK. I'M JUST. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS OVERALL BILL. IF I COULD ASK I SEE MEMBERS IF YOU COULD- SPEAK TO THE- ISSUE WITH. REGARD TO. EXCEPT TERMS. NOT HAVE THE TEAM THE SCHOOL YOU COULD YOU THAT EXCEPT YES ME ACTUALLY TURNED OVER TO A CHEST HOME AND SHE IT'S TO THAT THANK. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GO HOME DEPARTMENT FINE. SO THE BUDGET INCLUDES AT EIGHTY HOPE HARMLESS ALL DESTROY. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR I'M TO FILL OUT AN TO USE THEIR EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- AT IT. AS HAVING TO TAKE OUR ATTENDANCE PROPORTION OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND WE HEARD FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY TO ENSURE THAT- REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN TERMS OF. COMING TO SCHOOL NEXT YEAR THAT UNCLE HAD A STABLE SOURCE THE FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M BECAUSE WE ARE AN A DECLINING ENROLLMENT- SITUATION IN THE STATE CURRENTLY- PROVIDING AN AGING A HOLD HARMLESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT'S LIKELY TO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- FOR PURPOSES OF THE LCS THAT THEN YOU HAD OTHERWISE BEEN PROJECTING IN THAT WE'RE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT- WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT. I'M COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LCS AT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND GIVEN THAT I'M WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS SOME- THERE WERE SOME BOTH AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WERE- ANTICIPATING GROWTH HOWEVER. AND THE BUDGET THE BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR THOSE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL EIGHTY EIGHT PORTION MEANT- RELATED TO THAT GROWTH- SIMPLY BECAUSE- THAT COST. ABOUT YES THAT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT WE'RE NOT A 100% SURE. EXACTLY HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE WORSE WELL I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE- WHAT FAMILIES ARE GOING TO BE THE NEXT YEAR BUT- IT HAS THE- POTENTIAL TO BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. INTO THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE BUDGET AND THAT WAS. BEHIND IT. THANK YOU FOR FIRST SENATOR WHILE FOLLOWED BY SEVEN TO NIELSEN. ON THAT LAST POINT IN THE RESPONSE IS THERE ANY FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM GIVEN THE UNPREDICTABILITY UNCERTAINTY AND RATHER NOVEL SITUATION OF. I GUESS I SELECTED THAT INTENTIONALLY PRESENTED BY THIS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION WHAT HAPPENS WITH RESPECT TO THOSE CHARTERS ARE PERHAPS THE NON CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY DO HAVE A SPIKE. IN ENROLLMENT PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT OFFER PERHAPS A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT- CUTTING EDGE OF DIGITAL ONLINE A LEARNING PROCESS THAT OF SOME PARENTS FIND MORE ATTRACTIVE. IS OUR SYSTEM FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO COVER THOSE ADDITIONAL COST WHETHER THROUGH. A MID YEAR ADJUSTMENT OR A LOOK BACK. AND THOSE ARE DIFFICULT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE LPS AFTER THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- HOWEVER AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE NECESSARY- YOU KNOW. THERE THERE WOULD BE YES CERTAINLY THE BASED ON THE PROBABLY THE LEGISLATURE YOU COULD GO AND LOOK BACK AND PROVIDE- FUN- TO. AS BOOK LEGISLATION AGENCIES THAT HAD AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE- THROUGH THE CONTEXT THAT THE BILL WILL RESOURCES AT YOUR THROUGH THE NORMAL BUDGET. THANK YOU. THIRTY NIELSEN. THE. THREE FOUR FIVE POINT THREE BILLION ONE TIME FUNDING NOW THAT IS TO- PROVIDE HELP FOR THE CORONA VIRUS IMPACT. DO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS EQUALLY QUALIFIED TO DELVE INTO THIS FUND. BECAUSE THEY FACE THE SAME OBLIGATIONS AND CHALLENGES THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO WILL THEY BE ABLE TO THE RECOMPENSE TO THE BLACK FIVE POINT THREE BILLION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR NIELSEN JACKALS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABSOLUTELY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOL AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY NEED THAT THE CRITERIA- BILL FOR PART PART OF THAT FUNDING DEPENDS UPON AND SPECIAL EDUCATION ROMAN FOR TO THE EXTENT THEY HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. ANOTHER PART OF IT ON THE DEPENDENT UPON MENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANT. YEAH ELIGIBILITY AND FUNDING AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY RECEIVE THE FUNDS THEY WILL RECEIVE AND SOMETHING COULD NOT PORTION. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE IS JUST TOTAL ALTHEA. ON ENTITLEMENT AND BE AT ALL OF THEM WATER ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT AND THE THROUGH. PEOPLE PART OF THAT AS WELL YES THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EACH PIZZA BACK MONDAY AND THANK YOU AND ONE OTHER QUESTION THEN. OF WHAT I'M IN FOR. IS THAT THE DISTRICTS AND THEY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION- CANNOT UTILIZE LAYOFFS. NOW IF. A PERSON NOW IS SOME 80% I BELIEVE USED TO BE ALWAYS ROUGH RATE ROUGH AVERAGE OF ALL OF THESE OBLIGATIONS THAT DISTRICTS. HAVE WHY WOULD WE- NOT ALLOW THEM THAT VERY IMPORTANT OPTION THE LAYOFFS. JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT AND IT'S IN THE BUDGET ACT SO THERE IS A PROHIBITION ON- LAYOFFS FOR CLASSIFIED WORKERS THAT SPECIFICALLY WORK IN NUTRITION CUSTODIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. BUT THE BE THE AREAS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT- THE- A GREATER NEED AND GIVEN THE CONDITIONS A CO THAT NINETEEN- AS WELL AS- LIKE FOR INSTANCE IN THE IN THE- NUTRITION SERVICES- THOSE POSITIONS ARE GENERALLY FUNDED THROUGH THE NUTRITION CATEGORICAL WHICH IS NOT BEING. A PROPOSED TO BE CREDIT THIS TIME. IN AT THE THREE. FIVE AS OUR- THAT PERSONNEL PICTURE THERE IS- A SUSPENSION OF THE AUGUST FIFTEENTH LAY OFF STATE OR TEACHER CERTIFICATED STAFF- BUT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE CERTIFICATED STAFF- THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT- BILLING WHICH CLOSES OFF THE NORMAL MARCH FIFTEENTH AND LAY OUT. PETER NOTICED STATE- BUT- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE PROHIBITION ON LAYOFF- BUT HE DOES RECOGNIZE THAT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR TEACHERS AND- ARE YOU KNOW WHAT THE BITE THAT CONTENT TO BE THE MOST VULNERABLE DURING OUR SESSION- THAT THE- RECEIVE SOME LAUGHTER CAPTION- DURING CC AT NINETEEN. AND WHAT IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT SCHOOLS. FOR PROTECTING FOR CERTIFICATED- EMPLOYEES AT THERE DECLINING ENROLLMENT HOW CAN THEY JUSTIFY. HOLDING ON TO MORE OR STAFF. SHE'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I WOULD JUST RESPOND THAT AND WE ARE HOLDING EIGHTY A HARMLESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE YOU'RE EXPERIENCING DECLINING ENROLLMENT YOU WILL RECEIVE THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT YOU RECEIVED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY- IN ADDITION HEALTHY AFFECTED NOT BEING REFUSED- BEGIN TO AGREEMENT THE LEGISLATURE TO REMOVE ANY PRODUCTION ALTHEA THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. A CHARTER SCHOOL IN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- SHOULD BE THE SAME ALTHEA HALF LEVEL THAT THEY FALL IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND SORT OF- FOLLOWING UP ON CENTER ROCKS- QUESTION- SO I REPRESENT A DISTRICT I AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE GROWING AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE SHRINKING IN TERMS OF ENROLLMENT AND SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE- REASON FOR THE HOLD HARMLESS THERE'S- THROUGH BLACK CAST GOING BUT- THERE IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I KNOW PEOPLE REFERRED MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO. ARE AREAS WHERE THE POPULATION'S GOING ELK GROVE THE THOMAS THOSE TYPES OF AREAS. THE THEY'RE GOING TO BE STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT THEY WERE MADE SO THERE'S GOING TO SHIFT BECAUSE A COVETED BUT THERE WERE READY DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES THAT WERE HAPPENING BASED ON JUST DEVELOP THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WHAT THE APPROACH IS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO HANDLE THIS BECAUSE IT REALLY PUTS THEM INTO A BIND I MEAN IF. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THEY WOULD STILL BE GETTING AN INCREASE IN OUR LCF PROGRAM IS GROUNDED ON THE MONEY FOLLOWS A STUDENT SO. I GET IT YOU KNOW WHICH IS A LOT OF CHAOS GOING ON- BUT FOR. DISTRICT THAT WERE PROJECTING AN INCREASE JUST BECAUSE THEY KNEW THERE'S GONNA BE GROWTH IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO HELP THEM SO THERE'S POSSIBLY A SPIKE BECAUSE PEOPLE SHIFT SCHOOLS BUT ARE THINGS BECAUSE A COVERED RELATED BUT YEAH OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY HAVE A NATURAL GROWTH ARE THEY GOING TO BE PENALIZED BECAUSE OF THIS SO IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN PROVIDE SOME ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FACT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT GOVERNOR'S LOOKING AT PERHAPS AS WE GO INTO OUR GUESTS ARE AND TRY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IRVING PRISONER CAN AND WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO I'M HAVING A CONVERSATION IN THE SUMMER I THINK JUST TO PROVIDE- THE CONTEXT IN THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT OUR LIMITED RESOURCES- YOU KNOW WE- WE- WE KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE CAUGHT. IN EIGHTY HOLD HARMLESS AND- YOU KNOW WE- WE WERE. AT BOB THE HOLD HARMLESS INSURED THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE PROBABLY MOST IN FISCAL DISTRESS AND REALLY ARE DECLINING FULL DISTRICT DECLINING ENROLLMENT SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE REALLY EXPERIENCING GREATER LOCAL PRESSURES AND THOSE THAT ARE IN A GROWTH- TRAJECTORY- DOING SURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING WHEN WE WERE MAKING A DECISION DO WE- INSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING. AND LEVEL OF STABILITY FOR THOSE. WHO MAY EXPERIENCE AND DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT- OR DO YOU YOU KNOW WE JUST KIND OF ROLE THAT I SEE WHAT HAPPENS- YOU KNOW WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DON'T PROVIDE THE MANY TABILITY. BUT THEN ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE GROWING- CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE GROWTH THE NAY ANYTHING FROM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AN EQUITY LINE THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US. WHEN CONSIDERING THE IDEAL HOLD HARMLESS. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO- HAD DECLINING ENROLLMENT HAD MORE STABLE FUNDING DURING THIS CRISIS- UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE THERE MAY BE EVEN LESS FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO HAD- GROWING ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE LIKELY IN A BETTER FINANCIAL- POSITION GOING INTO THE CUP IN NINETEEN CRISIS. THAN THEY WERE DECLINING OKAY THANK YOU I GET THAT SO PERHAPS MAYBE ADDED MINISTRATION CAN HELP US OUT WITH DOING SOME ANALYSIS AND PROVIDING US AND DATA'S WERE GOING. INTO THE SUMMER. THAT'S TWO BASSES CAN WE GET SOME DATA ON WHAT WAS THE ANTICIPATED GROWTH FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND A SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO DO THESE PROJECTIONS ANYWAY FOR THEIR- BUILDING FUNDS AND FOR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT. THOSE THERE IS THAT CAN THAT A PART OF EDUCATION PROVIDE US WITH. THAT KIND OF DATA IN TERMS OF PRE CODE OF IT OF WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING GROWTH OR SHRINKAGE A DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO THAT IF WITH THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVER THE SUMMER DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS. THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE ABLE TO. THE POTENTIALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN MOST WIDELY DISTRIBUTED WHATEVER FUNDS WE MIGHT HAVE AVAILABLE. IN A WAY TO ADDRESS THIS. ISSUE I CERTAINLY UNDER. AND IN GENERALLY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SEE THAT YOU KNOW WE WANTED AND I DON'T KNOW STRONG I DON'T OPPOSE THE HOLD HARMLESS AT THE MOMENT- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE STABILITY FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT THE SAME TIME AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES I WANNA BE SURE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO. THERE'S A IS. AMAZING THAT WE DO ALSO HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE SUFFERING SOME DISTRESS BECAUSE- NOT BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY ARE GROWING AND YET TODAY AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY HAVE TO THEY MAY EVEN ANTICIPATED A BUDGETED FOR THE IDEA THAT HEY EIGHTY EIGHT WAS GONNA BE THE SAME OF WE'RE GOING TO GROW CERTAIN RATE WILL GET MORE MONEY AND SUDDENLY NOW THEY FIND OUT THEY'RE SHORT. RIGHT SO- AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR OUR DECISION MAKING MOVING FORD AND I APPRECIATED ADMINISTRATION COULD HELP US WITH GETTING THAT KIND OF INFORMATION. THAT AND OF LA A ONE COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. HELLO I CAN GET ON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO. WORK WITH YOU IF YOU WANT DATA ABOUT- HUMMING JUST DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN GROWING OR DECLINING. ON THE LATEST DATA WE HAVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INDICATES THAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF JUST SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEGOTIATOR EXPERIENCING GROW. EXPERIENCING DECLINES. IN ABOUT A THIRD IT I HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING GROSS. CRITICAL BIG NAMES YOU AND THEN MAKE. IT CERTAINLY MORE DETAILED INFORMATION TERMS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT GROWTH OR- THIS IN ROME IT IS ALSO HELPFUL THEY SAID WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE. BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT THAT MAGNITUDE. AS WELL AS THE DIRECTION IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THANK YOU. SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'VE JUST CURIOUS REP FOLLOWING UP ON SENATOR PANTS LINE OF QUESTIONING. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY JUNE'S AGE EIGHTEEN AND YOUNGER HAVE DIED OF CODED IN THE LAST. THREE MONTHS.

YES A WHEN IT COMES TO THAT ALTERNATIVE OVER TED JESSICA HOLMES BUT I WILL SAY THAT ALL- I'L MAKE TWO POINTS IT'S AN AND JESSICA CAN SPEECH ADDRESS. THE FIRST IS THAT A LOT OF THOUGHT WENT INTO THAT GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN IT COMES TO THE PAST FOR WORDS FOR SCHOOLS AND HOW THE RE OPENING PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE. AND HOW WILL HAPPEN SAFELY SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST POINT THE SECOND POINT WHICH I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE SIZE EVEN IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY. IS EVEN IF- SOMEONE ESPECIALLY A YOUNG PERSON WHO'S HEALTHY IS AT A LOW RISK- FOR ACTUALLY HAVING A DEBILITATING IMPACT FROM KOBE TO TERMS OF ON THEIR OWN PERSONAL HEALTH. DAY CAN STILL SPREADING TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH ESPECIALLY INTENSE FACES SO- AND ALL THE PUBLIC SPACE IS IT ALL THINGS THAT. ARE THE STATE OR IS DISTRICTS ARE OPERATING AND- YOU WANT TO TAKE A GOOD CARE AND SO THE GUIDANCE. AND IMPROPER TO REFLECT THOSE SAFETY MEASURES- AND POINTS AS THE IMPAIR THAT YOU. SURE THAT. WE HAVE STUDENTS ARE BACK IN SCHOOL. POSSIBLE ME TURN IT OVER TO JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT YEAH. THANK YOU YOU I JUST OF HOMES DEPARTMENT OF MY- SO AND THE BUDGETING THE DISCUSSION AS- RENDERS AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING IN ORDER TO EARN- WE'RE TO ENSURE THAT THE EIGHTY ABLE PROMOTED NOT PENALIZE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- SPECIFICALLY WE POINT OUT THAT IT CERTAINLY THE INTENTION.

AS I SAID THAT AND CATCHING ALLOWED AND THE LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD TO MAKE- MANY OF THOSE DETERMINATION HOWEVER I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- OF COURSE IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF THE STORY IN THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER HAD THE BILL OF THE THIRTY IN THIS AS WELL SO. THEY CAN ACTED THERE IS AN OUTBREAK LOCALLY AND WORK WITH OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT AND TO DO SO TO ENSURE THE HEALTHY. KIDS IN ON A FINAL NOTE- YOU HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT POINTS.

THANK YOU CAN HEAR MORE LOCK AFTER THAT QUESTION. ON THE BUDGET- THE BUDGET OR THE BUDGET BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE- ON THE FIFTEENTH AND IN AUGMENTATION TO STICK MATT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO BE PROVIDING THE OUTRAGE. THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL- FISCAL DISTRESS- DISTRICTS THAT ARE. BEING IDENTIFIED DURING THE RECESSION OR DURING THE CURRENT RECESSION- WE HAVE THE EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT INTO THEM READY IN PLACE TO THE STATE- FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO OUR IN.

AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS STRICT AND COUNTY OFFICES HAVE OTHER ME TO. AND MANAGE THEIR TO FLOW HOW MUCH IS SPECIALLY IN ANY LIKE THIS HAVE TO. AND THEY CAN TAKE OUT SHORT TERM CASH LOAN AND THEY CAN ALSO BORROW AGAINST THEIR OWN INTERNAL FUNDS FOR YOU ON THEIR WIZARD FOR CASUAL PURPOSES THEY HAVE MANY OPTIONS FOR THAT AS WELL- BUT YEAH THERE THERE ARE MANY. AN AVENUE THAT WILL JUST BE A CAN GO DOWN- TO HELP THEM THE CASH FLOW AND DURING TIMES LIKE THE- HOMES. I DO FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD SAID YOU. IN THE ORIGINAL BUDGET BILL WE DID HAVE FUNDING PERFECT MATTER JUST. THIRTEEN HERE AMOUNT IT WAS- AMOUNT OR WAS IT JUST A- THE PROMISED TO BE THERE.

PRESENTER OF A WHOLE HECK A LOT OF ELEVEN MONIES IN MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY DID A ZOOM. CALL WITH THE SUPER DISCOURSE TONY THURMOND- AND MAN MY SUPERINTENDENTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP ON THE CALLS WERE LIABILITY. AND I DID I LOOK THROUGH THE BUDGET AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY AUGMENTATION FOR LIABILITY SO LET'S. ASSUME THAT WE'RE GOING TO BACK TO SCHOOL- WHICH IS A QUESTION MARK I THINK. THEY WERE ALL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. A VOTE WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK AND THEN LIABILITY WHAT WHAT WITH THE- BOY THAT LOOK LIKE- BECAUSE I KNOW THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. ON THAT WE SPOKE WITH THE ENERGY THE DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE OBVIOUSLY IF THEY HAVE AN OUTBREAK WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE- FINANCIALLY FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND SO I AS THE BUDGET DOES NOT CONTAIN- AS ANY DISCUSSION OF FISCAL HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION CAN CAN YOU REPEAT IT. YEAH WELL MY I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT. LET'S SAY THAT A SCHOOL OPENS BACK UP THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING THEY HELP OFFICER IN THE- THEY'VE HAVE P. P. EASE ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND THEY GET AN OUTBREAK. AND THERE'S RISK IN THAT AND THEN SOME PARENTS. SUSE I ME I IT'S GOING TO BE I THINK IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO. TO PERSONAL KEEP A FACE MASK ON OF FIVE YEAR OLDER AS A YEAR OLD AND THE WHOLE I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF CONCERN FROM. SCHOOL BOARDS THAT THERE IS A HUGE LIABILITY AND NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT THAT IT'S- IT'S THE SAME PLACE IN BUSINESS AS WELL I KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION YOUR BUT BUSINESSES ARE IN THE SAME BOAT. WHETHER WHO WERE LIABILITY LIES SOMEBODY GETS SICK AND- THERE IS A DEATH MAYBE EVEN AND THEN WHO'S LIABLE THAT AND THERE'S A COST THIS. AND DON'T TALK ABOUT.

SENSELESS IN AND THEN THERE'S THE CHALLENGE AT LEAST OUR DISTRICT THAT THERE ARE A LOT NEAR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE INTERNET OR THE ABILITY FOR THAT TO TRANSMIT. FOR A DISTANCE LEARNING. THOSE ARE BIG CHALLENGES IN AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE. TO BUS CHILDREN BACK AND FORTH TO SCHOOLS- ANYWAY YEAH I JUST WANTED TO GET ON YOUR RADAR- I KNOW THAT WHEN NOBODY DOES TALK ABOUT LIABILITY BUT IT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

ON AB SEVENTY SEVEN. OKAY SEEN NONE- IF YOU ALL WOULD MIND INDULGING SENATOR REQUIRE AND WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO. YOU CAN'T SEE ME SMILING AND LAUGHING BEHIND MY MATH OF WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO A. B. EIGHTY NINE- THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- ALLOW MISS REQUIRED TO POSE A QUESTION TO FINANCE AND REQUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE PATIENTS VENTURED MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE. YES I'M LOOKING. AT THE ISSUE IN REGARDS TO THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IN REGARD TO THE CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUNDS. COMING IN FROM THE CARES ACCESO A TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M STRAIGHT AND IF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN COMMENT ON WHERE I'M GOING IN THESE NEXT WORDS SO MY INTEREST IN IS THAT COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. REALLY DOLLARS WILL BE ABLE TO GET FIVE EITHER THE FINANCE- BOULDER IS THE COPPER DEPARTMENT OF. PLAY IN THIS IS WELL. SINCE IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A VARIANCE FOR EXAMPLE COUNTIES WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK. WITH OBVIOUSLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER T. P. H. BUT IF YOU COULD JUST DESCRIBE THAT PROCESS AND HOW THAT WILL WORK IN THE CERTIFICATION. WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED NAY AFTER SHE'D AGAIN THE PATIENT'S VENTURE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR I'LL JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT IN TERMS OF HOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST THINKING ABOUT IT AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. KRISTIN SHELTON I THINK THE DETERMINATION IS MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT CERTAINLY IN CONSULTATION. WITH YOU THE OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT PARTICULAR. THE FASTEST. MOST UPDATED HEALTH ADVICE AND GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION BECAUSE IT IS OF ALL. SO CERTAINLY- WILD FINANCES MAKING THAT DETERMINATION- IT'S GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE EXPERTS WHO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH EVERY DAY. AS WE ADDRESS THE SPEND DOWN NEXT THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS JUST SAID BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR DID. TODAY AND THE WAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING ABOUT THIS GUIDANCE IS IN A SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION SO THE GOAL HERE IS CERTAINLY NOT. TO GO OUT THERE AND START ANALYZING PEOPLE AND GANKING AWAY. YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS WORK. WE THE REASON WE ARE PUTTING THIS IS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE BEST WAY GIVEN THAT SO MANY REALIGNED AND SERVICE IS OUR DIRECT TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND PUBLIC SAFETY THOSE GOALS ARE. ALIGNED WITH MAKING AS MUCH PROGRESS I GET DEPEND AS WE AND AS- BEST WE CAN THAT'S- RIGHT AND- OKAY. AT GUIDANCE AND TO. PROVISIONS THAT YOU JUST. BUT LET ME IT OVER TO KRISTIN SHAW. YOU DISCUSS WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON KRISTIN TO OF NAY ON. I'M THE BACK ACTUALLY COVER MODE OF THE KEY POINTS I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD KIND OF EMPHASIZE A POINT TWO RELATIVE TO THE PROCESS AS THE CERTIFICATION- TO USE THE FUNDS CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE STARTS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL SO IT START WITH THE CITY OR WITH THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE. THAT CERTIFICATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN BASED ON THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED- WOULD CONSULT WITH OUR AND COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. RELATIVE TO WHERE THEY ARE AND IN THEIR PROCESS IN TERMS OF OPENING AND COMPLIANCE PROBABLY WOULD BE- PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS AND GATHER P. BUT I WOULD NOTE HERE IS. THE LANGUAGE IN AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT IMPOSE A NEW REQUIREMENTS ON COUNTIES. ACT AT FIVE REASON THAT ARE. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY EACH AS WE CAN TO COME. THANK YOU. SO THANK YOU VERY CHAIR AND THE CHAIR GOING BACK TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE PROCESS OF A COUNTY JUANITA VARIANCE THEY WOULD SUBMIT WHAT THEY'VE DONE LOCALLY IN THAT PLAN WILL BE REVIEWED BY BOTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN CD P. H. I. N. DâN THUMBS UP IN REGARDS A CERTIFICATION BE GRANTED. OR pTHAT- I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT THE VARIANCE PROCESS IS INFORMAL BUT IT'S NOT AS FORMAL AS SOME MAY THINK- IN OBVIOUSLY ONUS IS PUT ON THE LOCALS IF YOU JUST GIVE A LITTLE MORE COLOR ON THAT- AND PROVIDE SOME MORE LIGHT THAT WOULD BE GREAT THE END OF THAT WE MY FINAL QUESTION BUT IF YOU JUST DO A LITTLE BIT A DEEPER DIVE ON WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT. A AT. THIS THIRTY THAT I AM PLANNING AND THE TESTING. SPONSOR ABILITY WILL BE OUTSIDE OF THIS PROCESS SO THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING BETWEEN THE COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN- RELATIVE TO WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GETS AS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD AT THE OUTSIDE- CERTIFICATION FORM. THAT ESSENTIALLY. DID ADD NOTIFIES US- FROM THE COUNTY THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH DOGS FRAUD ORDERS AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THERE WILL BE- PLENTY OF WORK CERTAINLY BETWEEN THE LOCAL INTO T. AND B. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE REVIEWING IN TERMS OF THEIR- PLANNING RELATIVE TO RE. OPENING HOW THEY CONTINUE TO MONITOR DO CONTACT TRACING EXCITED ABOUT IS REALLY LARGELY BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND HE AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHERE WE WILL CHECK IN- WITH. PRIOR TO DOING ALLOCATIONS OF FINDING- IT WOULD BE WHEN WE RECEIVE THAT CERTIFICATION. AND THEN- PROVIDING THEM A LIST OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAVE CERTIFIED AS- RELATIVE TO VERIFYING WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR CURRENT PLANNING STAGES. THANK YOU. TURNING TO SENATOR DOLLY. I WANT TO TAKE THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SECOND DISTRICT TO A SPUR TO THOUGHT TOWN. ABOUT THAT FUNDING SO JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT. I HAVE DEALT WITH IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A VERY OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIVERSE AND ONE SIZE DOESN'T ALWAYS FIT ALSO A DURING- SO I GUESS I'M ONE OF EXPAND ON A SYNONYM ACQUIRES QUESTION IT. TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO ALL THIS GIVEN EXAMPLE MODOC COUNTY- MET ALL THE CRITERIA. HAS TO THIS DAY ZERO CASES OF CODE. AND A WANTED TO- X. OPEN AND SO THEY DID- WITHOUT THE CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS A BLESSING. AND SO THEN THERE WAS SOME PUSH BACK SO I KNOW IN THIS BUDGET THAT IT BASICALLY SAYS. THAT IF YOU DON'T APPLY DAY WILL CUT YOUR FUND. MAN AND SO WHO IS WHO IS THAT IS IT THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER IS THE STATE HEALTH OFFICER WHO IS THE PERSON THAT IS. IS GOING TO MEET THAT CRITERIA- SO THAT THEY SO WE CAN GET A- LOT ARE LOCALS KNOW BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WHAT HAPPENS IN SAN DIEGO L. A. SAM DISCO IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN MAYBE SISKIYOU OR- MOTOR ARE DEALT. WITH THE CENTER FROM THE SECOND IS YOU GOT TO WHERE HE WAS GOING AND I WON A LITTLE MORE CLARIFICATION ON. ONE WHAT IS THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER- OR IS IT THE- DAY THE HEAD OF THE STATE AND I WOULD JUST SHARE WITH YOU THAT. IN OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. TEN HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE RESIGNED BECAUSE THERE ARE CONFLICTS AND IS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB TO JOB IN THIS DAY AND AGE. HI KRISTIN STOCKTON FROM FINANCE. I'M I THINK THAT IT AT THE LOCAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER BUT WILL BE WORKING WITH STATEWIDE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND THAT'S KIND OF THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS. I AM IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU PROVIDED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHILE AND- SENT INTO TEASE MAY HAVE ADVANCED TO BEARER ADAM. RE OPENING STRATEGIES AND MOST OF THOSE HAVE BEEN ON BACK AND WORKED AGAIN IN THE SPARE A COLLABORATION. WITH THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE PROCEDURES AND PROCESS. PLACE TO ATTRACT EIGHT. BUT. AND AS- OF THAT COUNTY AND HOW SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF FIRST OF IN THE PROCESS AGAIN AND WE WERE. CONTINUE TO PURSUE- THIS THREE THAT SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND WORK THROUGH ISSUES WE ARE AND TAKING ANY MONEY AWAY. WE BASICALLY WILL HAVE THESE CHECK INS THAT BEN ALLOW FORM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO BE DISTRIBUTED ARE ALLOCATED TO THE COUNTY SO THE SAYS. THIS IS THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO USE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC SAFETY AND THAT THAT MANY WILL FLOW BASED ON BE CERTIFICATION THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN WE- CAN ARE GONNA PUBLIC HEALTH RELATIVE. FINANCE IS. A GENERAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT ACCOUNT I NOT COMPLYING WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT PROCEDURES AND PROCESS THESE NEED TO BE. PUT INTO PLACE- AS A STATE SO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WOULD HELP WITH THAT AND THEN AND THEN WE WOULD RESUME. TRADING ANYTIME.

ASSISTANCE YES SIXTY MONTHS WITH THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW I DON'T MANAGE RESEARCH A CENTER INTRODUCTORY REMARKS AND THIS TAKE A- TWENTY. TWO LIKELY TO. ON WHEN.

YEAH WE'RE FACING A PANDEMIC WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THROUGH THAT LENS AS WELL. AS SOME PLEASED TO HEAR ABOUT THE- BE ABLE TO NOT CUT AYE HSS THE PROGRAM TO KEEP PEOPLE AGAIN OUT OF INSTITUTIONS THAT BILL PROTECT OTHER PROGRAMS FOR THE AGED BUT ALSO TRYING TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES. AS THEY ARE. BEING PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE ECONOMIC ISSUES RELATED TO CO BID- PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS- PEOPLE GEN GET THEIR CAL FRESH.

GREAT THANK YOU MISTER ONE OFTEN. YES I'LL JUST SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN I HAVE TYLER WOODS ON THE LINE AS WELL- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- WITH THE PROGRAM AT THE SIDES THERE ARE A NUMBER AT THE MINISTRATION AT THANKS FOR MASON TECHNOLOGIES AND RELATED ISSUES GIVEN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROGRAM. THAT WOULDN'T ALLOW. IT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SO THAT THE REFLECTED FOR ALL RECIPIENTS BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO TYLER. I SENATOR THAT'S CORRECT AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT THE COMMITMENT TO MAKING THIS POLICY CHANGE WOULD NEED TO BE MADE WELL IN ADVANCE BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ISSUES IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO MAKE THIS POLICY CHANGE. IN THOSE AUTOMATION SYSTEMS SO THAT IT'S UP AND RUNNING. DO YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE A- ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT WOULD COST IF IT WAS IMPLEMENTED TODAY. I DON'T HAVE A COST ON HAND FOR WHAT WOULD COSTS TODAY BUT I THINK THE GENERAL THINKING AND WHY WE DON'T HAVE THAT COST ESTIMATE IS THAT- THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT MANUAL WORK AROUNDS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND IT WOULD INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ERRORS FOR WE TO TURN. THIS POLICY CHANGE ON WITHOUT HAVING IT AUTOMATED FIRST. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT THE QUESTION WITH THE DOLLAR BECAUSE I THINK WHEN- WE- REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE IT WAS SIXTY WEEKS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF. FEDERAL WELFARE REFORM I THINK WHEN WE CUT IT IN THE BUDGET TO FORTY EIGHT I DON'T KNOW THE WE HAD THE LEAD TIME SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I WISH IT WERE SOONER BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE AUTOMATION CHALLENGES SO THANK YOU FOR RAISING THE ISSUE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR SKINNER.

TRYING TO- SECURE THE TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT THAT'S REQUIRED AND I JUST REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE IN THIS BUDGET ARE DRESSING- PROVIDING APPROPRIATE- BOTH ASSISTANCE AND- PROCESS EASE TO- SO MANY PEOPLE IN A THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA YOU'VE REALLY BEEN IMPACTED AND THERE'S MANY ELEMENTS OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THAT WILL REALLY HELP- OUR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY FIFTEEN NON LET'S MOVE ON TO AB AT THE HEALTH TRAILER BILL MISTER WILSON OFTEN. YES AB AT IS SET ANOTHER BIG DEL- RELATED TO HEALTH- COVERING NUMBER GIPSON PROVISIONS IN THE HEALTH AREA I'LL JUST MENTION A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THE FIRST IS RELATED TO A NUMBER OF THE DRUG PRICE- PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD- RACIALLY INTRODUCED IN JANUARY- THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITH THE AUTHORITY TO. NEGOTIATE TRUCK CRISIS THAT INCLUDING ON BEHALF OF NINE MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS TO HELP BRING DOWN OR REDUCE THE GROWTH IN THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL OVERWEIGHT STRENGTHENING ADD THE MEDI CAL RESPONSE TO CODE NINETEEN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ALL LINED UP WITH THE LATEST THAT WE HAVE HEARD. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT DIRECTION TO MAXIMIZE THAT POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVED THROUGH THAT FEDERAL MEDICAID MEDICARE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE OTHER FEDERAL MATCHES MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE DOLLARS THAT WE CAN. THIS HEALTH CRISIS. THERE% ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS- I WILL MENTION TO KNOW IT'S JUST WHEN IT COMES TO THE STRUCTURE OF OUR OVERALL BUDGET THE FIRST IS REGARD. PROPOSITION HE SAID WHICH I KNOW. THE SIX AND THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY DASH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SCHOOL YEAR- BUT THE BUDGET DOES INCLUDE- SUSPENSIONS UP MOST OF THAT FUNDING. FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF VALUE BASED PAYMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS ON JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. UNLESS THERE ARE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET- TO REDUCE YET RIVER THOSE BACK TO THE WAY THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. AND THEN THE SECOND NOTE BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S ALSO BEEN A DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS REGARDING- THAT PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE GOVERNOR HAD IN JANUARY FOR A UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AT AGE SIXTY FIVE DEPOSITS FOR MEDI CAL. THIS BILL SIZES THAT'S NOT INCLUDED DIRECTLY IN THIS BUDGET- BUT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BE PRIORITIZED IF WE DID HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES OVER THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST BUDGET WINDOW. IN ORDER TO FUND THAT PROGRAMS THAT SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE KEY PROVISIONS I'VE GOT RYAN MILLER MY COLLEAGUES FLAWS WAS WELL SEVERAL OTHERS ON THE LINE. AND RAPIDLY TAKING QUESTIONS THANK. YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THREE TO PAY FOLLOW BY SENATOR NIELSEN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH I DO. OF WANT TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR AT LEAST- FOR ONE YEAR- TRYING MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY SIX- STRUCTURE AND FOR- NOT TO. IMPOSING CUTS ON PEOPLE WITH. REGARDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- ESPECIALLY DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. WHEN WE ACTUALLY NEED PEOPLE TO GET GREATER ACCESS- MAY NOT HAVE DONE AS FAR AS WE'D LIKE TO BUT AT. LEAST WE WEREN'T- CUTTING- OPTIONAL BENEFITS MANY OTHER SERVICES. I DO HOPE THAT WHILE THIS IS IN THE BUDGET FOR PLANNING FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO REVISIT THIS VERY ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YET AND BUDGET SUB THREE. REGARDING A PROPERTY SIX BE SURE WE MAINTAIN THOSE REVISIONS AROUND. VALUE BASED PAYMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS FISHER PEOPLE CONTINUE TO ACCESS. PURPOSES THE BASE PAYMENTS OF US TO MAKE MEDI CAL MORE. COST EFFECTIVE. TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT KIND OF INCENTIVES I THINK WE'LL BE SHORT SIGHTED FOR US TO CUT DAD'S THE FEW. BUT THAT WILL A TO. NECK YOU AND THE NEXT POLLS. IN THE MEANTIME I DO APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE DAY AT. FROM BOTH LET'S LEADERS AND APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZING. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. DONE TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE HAVE ACCESS TO THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. FOR HEALTH CARE NOW WITH FOR THE WORKING OF THE GOVERNOR AND- FOR SITTING OUT FURTHER REFORMS A MEDI CAL INCLUDING CAL AIM OF WHICH I KNOW HOW TO BE DEFERRED I WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WAIVERS. AND THEN OF COURSE- CONTINUING THAT PROPERTY SIX STRUCTURE BEYOND JUST COMING BUDGET YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIRTY NIELSEN. THIRTY NIELSEN. ONE OF THE PROVISIONS HERE IS BE REQUESTING. NUMEROUS THE BEST OF MORE INFORMATION FROM HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS AND PROVIDERS THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT ALL OF THIS EXTRA DATA. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE FOR THAT DATA AND AS YOU ARE TO RECEIVE IT HOW IT'S AN APARTMENT GOING TO HANDLE. THE DATA HOW THEY'RE GOING TO EVALUATE IT STORY AND WHAT PURPOSE IS IT INTENDED TO BE USED. SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- RYAN MILLER- THEY MAY- IF YOU COULD CLARIFY- WHICH THAT PROVISION YOU'RE REFERRING TO SPECIFICALLY ALTHOUGH MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN MAY HAVE A SPECIFIC SENSE WELL A- IT APPARENTLY IS. REQUIRING OF THESE PLANS AT ALL TO SUBMIT A LOT MORE DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT. ABOUT THE POPULATION WHAT THEY'RE PROVIDING FOR. I WOULD IMAGINE THE DEMOGRAPHICS- HEALTH ISSUES THE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE REPORTING ON I'M WONDERING WHY WE NEED THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AT TO- YOU KNOW TO PURGE THE ROLES OR SOMETHING OR OR- WHY WERE YOU NEEDING THAT INFORMATION AND IF IT IS COMING IN FROM THE FIELD THIS VAST. ARRAY OF INFORMATION. HOW WILL YOU DEPARTMENT BE ABLE TO HANDLE AND THEY HAVE A PLAN FOR HANDLING- COLLECTING DISSEMINATING EVALUATING ALL OF THIS NEW VAST ROUTE RESERVOIR OF INFORMATION. YEAH THANK YOU CENTER RYAN MILLER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO AS YOU MAY BE AWARE A FEW YEARS AGO- RECENT BUDGET ALLOCATED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND- TO. BUILD OUT WHAT'S KNOWN AS A HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS DATABASE OR AND ALL YOUR DATABASE- AND SO THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL MAKE SOME CHANGES THAT WILL. ALTER MY CAR LEON MOST WHO CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAIL AND SPECIFICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. WE ARE ALMOST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. ARE AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTION THIS BILL FOLLOWS AB EIGHTEEN KIND- WHICH WAS PASSED COUPLE YEARS AGO- THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING THE DATA IS TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE QUALITY AND THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY. THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES TO PROTECT THE- INFORMATION AND THERE'S ALSO- CONTROLLED ACCESS FROM THE PUBLIC- FOR QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. I CAN IMAGINE HAVE A HIP A NIGHTMARE. WITH THIS INFORMATION- AND THAT CAUSES MUSED SOMEWHAT QUESTION THE NEED FOR DEMANDING IT. SURE SO THERE THERE'S CURRENTLY AND I. T. PROJECT GOING ON THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE- PROJECT APPROVED BOTH LIFECYCLE OF TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT- ALL OF THE STATE AS YOU MENTIONED IT IS A VAST AMOUNT OF DATA AND WE ARE PREPARING TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT- BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU. THIRTY DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON I MEANT TO SAY THIS- EARLIER BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MADAM CHAIR- IN THIS WHOLE BUDGET PROCESS- THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE OUTCOME IS DIFFERENT TODAY BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE APPROACH THAT WAS. THAT WAS TAKEN THANK YOU AND ARE PRO TAMAN OUR LEADERSHIP- FOR TAKING THAT APPROACH AND SHOWING THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THINGS. BUT I AM OUR RIGHTS TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN AND ACTUALLY MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE INTENT LANGUAGE PROPOSE FOR EXPANDING MEDICAID ALL FOR UNDOCUMENTED SENIORS OF THE PROPOSED CRITERIA TO IMPLEMENT THE EXPANSION. IS TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND I'M NOT SURE. EVER. SO WHAT DO I SAY TO. OLDER CALIFORNIANS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM BUT WHAT I SAY TO THEM WHEN THEY ASK ME THAT THEIR INCOME LEVELS SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. FOR LESS. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE PREVENTATIVE CARE PRIMARY CARE. I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE ON THIS BUDGET DUE TO OUR OUR- OF HANDLING AND THE WAY WHAT WHAT WE HAD TO DO IS CALL BUT NINETEEN. THIS LANGUAGE IS A SECOND WALK BACK. FROM THE COMMITMENT THAT HAD BEEN MADE. IN JANUARY. THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITY- IN THE STATE ARE STILL THERE. WE WERE TAKING A STEP BY STEP AND THAT TOOK PATIENTS ON EVERYBODY'S PART- FIRST ZERO TWO EIGHTEEN IN THE NINETEEN TO TWENTY SIX AND- AS- I KNOW AS MUCH AS WE ALL MANY OF US SESSIONS A WEEK BUT MANY OF US. REALLY WANTED TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP SOONER WERE. UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BUDGET AND THE TO SEE A TAKEN TO TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE BUT THIS LANGUAGE HERE IS VERY CONFUSING- ARM AND I DON'T I DON'T SEE I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN IT THAT GIVES ME HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN. THE PANDEMIC IS NOT SON LATE OF GOING AWAY. IT'LL BE HERE THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR OFF AND OTHER CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE ARE COMING IN THE FLU SEASON AND- OTHER REASONS. COULD WE HAVE TRIMMED ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY FIVE LINE ITEMS. I THINK SO. WITH THAT I'VE HEARD ANY DEPARTMENT OR BUREAU. I DON'T THINK SO I REALLY EXPECTED THAT WE WERE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH MORE EXPLICIT WAY BUT- I THANK EVERYBODY WORKED HARD ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR MINING. SENATOR PAN I THANK YOU AYE MANAGER FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON NASSER NIELSEN'S- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A WHAT SOME PEOPLE TERM THE ALL PAYERS CLAIM DATABASE- CO ED BASICALLY DATA COLLECTION TO ALLOW US TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW WE ARE SPEND YOUR HEALTHCARE DOLLAR NOT ONLY MEDI CAL BUT IN OTHER WE AS A WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN DONE BY OTHER STATES. I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR INITIAL PROPOSED IN JANUARY IN OFFICE AFFORDABILITY WHICH UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF OUR BUDGET SITUATION AND COVERED- IT WE'RE NOT DANCING THIS YEAR BUT- CERTAINLY. WANT TO. SAY THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BUT- ALSO APPRECIATE STERN NIELSEN RAISING SOME OF THE ISSUES REGARDING THAT- WE THIS DATA IS COLLECTED IN A WAY AND STORED IN A WAY THAT MAINTAINS THE CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH I'M SURE WILL BE- BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THE WORKING ON GOING BASIS FOR MANY YEARS- THAT WOULD. PROVIDE POTENTIALLY GREAT BENEFIT AND US BEING ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN BETTER MANAGE OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS. PARTICULARLY INCLUDING THE STATE AND WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON HEALTH CARE SO- IT'S WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR BAIL.

THERE ARE TWO OF WE NEED TO HAVE DUE TO THE EXPERIENCES WERE ALL GOING THROUGH WITH THIS VIRUS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT INCLUDED AS A PREVENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE WAIVER. ONE THING SPECIFICALLY. I THINK THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. DISCUSSED IN THE WAIVER IS- IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AREA IS THE PEER SUPPORT. SERVICES AGREEMENT I WANT TO FIND OUT WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER DISCUSSING IN THE WAIVER- MENTAL HEALTH PEER SUPPORT SERVICES- AS PART OF THE WAIVER AGREEMENT. I SENATOR BELLAMY TURN IT OVER TO RIGHT NOW ARE AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- I THINK ANY YEAH WE KNOW THAT THE TRAILER BILL BEFORE US DOES NOT I DON'T THINK CONTAIN PROVISIONS RELATED TO THAT WAIVER ALTHOUGH YOU ARE CORRECT WE ARE ARE- SEEKING AN EXTENSION I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ON.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS UNDER- RYAN OTHER PARKING FINANCE- AS YOU MAY KNOW IN JANUARY WE HAD A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED NURSING FACILITY FINANCE AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF REFORMS RELATED TO QUALITY.

SYSTEM AND- AND RATE SYSTEM- SO WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY MAKING CHANGES TO THE TO THE QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ARE COSTS. PROGRAM BUT I HAVE OF MY CALLING JACOB LAMB HERE WHO MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDES MORE DETAIL IF YOU. OBJECT ONE PART OF FINANCE ARE WE JUST NOTE THAT THE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING TODAY CONTAINS PROVISIONS SAYING THAT. NURSING FACILITIES MUST COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND CODE MEDICATION PLANS PUT FORWARD BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. HEALTH AND WITH THAT WE ARE HOPING THAT OF. REQUIRING THEM TO COMPLY WITH THESE OF MITIGATION PLANS WILL. IS CENTER LAW. BY THE THEM TO RECEIVE THE COSTA. I QUESTION THE NATURE MY QUESTION- WAS REALLY ABOUT. IT MAY NOT BE A PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE COST FRAMEWORK WITH. THE MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THERE'S ED ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO. E. BRINGING IN TO POST ACUTE FACILITIES- COVE A POSITIVE PATIENTS UNDER THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT FRAMEWORK. IS THAT IS THAT STILL THE CASE. BUT YOU GET A DID YOU GET MORE FUNDING UNDER YOUR MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT IF YOU BRING SOMEONE IN POST ACUTE CARE. WITH WITH THAT CONDITION VERSES WITHOUT. THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PAYMENTS ARE CURRENT ONLY STRUCTURED- WE DO HAVE A 10% INCREASE FOR REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITY JUST FOR THE DURATION OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT THAT IS A RATE INCREASE FOR ALL SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE- CONDITIONS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE SERVING IN THE SPECIAL PLEASE I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC PAYMENT THAT INCREASE. PAYMENTS FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE SPECIFICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH KOBE. OKAY THANK YOU. THIRTY PAN I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL- APPRECIATE THAT- I MEAN THIS FUNDING THAT WILL GAME FOR QUITE PRUDENT FEE IS TO DRAW DOWN MORE MEDI CAL MONEY FOR OUR- FACILITIES BUT I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT- THERE ARE CERTAINLY CHALLENGES- FOR. OUR THERE'S A FACILITIES WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE NEED TO TRY TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT KEEP PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO BE INSTITUTIONALIZED BUT THE FOR THE ONES WHO ARE- WE KNOW THAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA AT LEAST. RECENTLY AT LEAST 5050% OF OUR CALVET DEATH SAID HAPPENED AMONG RESIDENTS OF THESE FACILITIES. SO THERE IS NEED FOR MORE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE SURE THEY HAVE ADEQUATELY DETER HAVE INCREASED EXPENSES AS WELL SO CERTAINLY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART. THIS QUITE SURE AND SPEED TO TRY TO DRAW DOWN MORE FUNDS FOR THESE FACILITIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN TERMS OF- INSPECTIONS AND- BE SURE THAT WE THE THESE FACILITIES ARE UP TO SNUFF- IN TERMS OF- THE SUPPORTS AND ALSO FUNDING FOR STAFF AND- PP AND SO FORTH SO I JUST. WANNA MAKE MENTION OF THAT I KNOW THE COUPLE THE PART OF HEALTH IS. AS CERTAINLY. NEED TO DRESS AND W. DID HAVE A HEARING OF THE- PANDEMIC PREPAREDNESS COMMITTEE ON THIS VERY ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP- FORTIES UP THROUGH IS NOT ABLE TO DO AS MUCH OVERSIGHT OVER THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH CITY PH ABOUT THE INSPECTIONS AND- WHAT'S BEING DONE TO BE SURE THAT THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND FACILITIES I ALSO WANT TO FOLLOW UP BECAUSE OF PORTION OF THIS ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT. FUNDS AS WELL. AND SO WE ARE GETTING MORE FLEXIBILITY THE COUNTIES- BUT I. I HOPE THAT- THERE'S GOING TO BE WITH THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND- NOW EVERYONE IS PROJECTING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREATER NEEDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AS A RESULT OF COVETED. SO IS A SEE THAT THERE'S MORE FLEXIBILITY AND GIVING COUNTIES AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO HAVE TO EXPEND OR RESERVES. THAT THERE IS AN EXPECTATION IN MY MIND AND I. FINANCES THOUGHTS AS WELL THAT WE EXPECT COUNTIES TO BE USING THESE FUNDS TO PROVIDE THOSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING A GREATER DEMAND FOR THEM- ACCIDENT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE LEVEL SERVICE COUNTIES ARE GONNA BE PROVIDING- WITH THESE FUNDS ARE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT COLLEAGUES FINA LET'S TRANSITION TO AB AT TO GENERAL GOVERNMENT MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN. EIGHTY EIGHTY TWO REFERS TO A COUPLE DIFFERENT ISSUES- RELATED TO STATE GOVERNMENT I'LL JUST MENTION THREE OF THE CHANGES THERE IN VERY DIFFERENT AREAS THE FIRST RELATES TECH CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AND SHIFTING INVESTIGATORS FROM THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. THE SECOND RELATES TO BROADBAND WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION BOTH FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE IT TURNS OUT THAT AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE FCC HAS A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR OUR FEDERAL RURAL DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY SIGNED BY TO INCREASE BROADBAND ADOPTION ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IT'S DISTRIBUTED THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANTS. SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS IT WOULD UPDATE THE PROVISIONS ACT THAT CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND- AND ABLE TO THE CITY TO BETTER COMPETE FOR THESE GRANDSON MAY BE SCRAPPED FUNDS BY ALLOWING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS FOR THIS FINE. AND THEN FINALLY A THIRD PROVISION RELATES TO THE SALES TAX PROVISIONS FOR USED CARS THAT WERE AT AN ACT- THAT WERE UP PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE- EARLIER THIS MONTH AND EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE- AND THIS BILL INCLUDES A COUPLE OF CLEAN UP PROVISIONS FOR WEIGHT. AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. MEMBERS QUESTIONS. CENA WITH- MOVE ON TO A. B. EIGHTY THREE HOUSING THE SERVICEMAN OFTEN. AB AT TREE TOUCHES ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES NOT RIGHT EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME MISTER DALI I MISSED YOU I APOLOGIZE LET'S GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS TRAILER BILL MISTER DALI THANK YOU MANAGER SORRY I. I'M WEIGH EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE WAY THAT I MISSED YOU MY FAULT SO JUST A QUICK. COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE SITE I WAS OF. WE WORKED ON THE CAST OF FUNDS A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I KNOW THAT TIME YOU'RE TENDING TO LEVERAGE THE FEDERAL FUNDS. IS THERE'S TECHNICAL STATE OF ASSISTANCE FOR APPLYING FOR BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE ARE THEY GONNA BE COMBINED. UNDER THE PC. SO I BELIEVE- AND I SHOULD PROBABLY- I NEED TO CHECK THE DETAILS ON THIS I BELIEVE THAT WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING IS IT MAKING IT EASIER- WHEN WE ARE APPLYING FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MATCHING FUNDS THROUGH THE ADVANCED SERVICES FUND BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE ACTUAL GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT SOURCES ARE POOL TOGETHER IT'S MORE THAT HOW THE FUNDS TO BE STACKED ON. TOP EACH OTHER FOR A GIVEN APPLICATION IS MADE EASIER SERVICE FOR OUR BILLS BUT I'M HAPPY THAT. IT GETS MORE DETAIL ON THAT FOR YOUR OFFICE. OKAY PROJECT THAT THEN I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION ON THE- THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE ENTREPRENEUR MICROGRAMS FOR IMMIGRANTS- IF SO IF I WAS IMMINENT HOW TO HOW TO ACCESS THAT PROGRAM WHAT. STATE AGENCY- PROVIDES THIS SERVICE FOR. FOR IMMIGRANTS. SO I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT PROVIDE A IMMIGRANTS SERVICES- I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE SEED- PROGRAM AND THIS WILL BE A NEW FOR PROGRAM AND SOURCE OF FUNDING. HOW THAT APPLICATION PROCESS I WOULD ACTUALLY WORK- I ALSO NEED TO GO BACK AND CHECK ON THAT ALSO- THESE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO WHAT WHAT. A WHAT'S STATUS DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS AYE I'M- A CONFUSED ON HOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE HERE ILLEGAL HOW YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS IF THEY'RE WHAT WHAT AGENCY THAT WOULD BE. GOT IT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS CUT BECAUSE ON THE LINE AND YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO. THE SEED PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE LABOR AGENCY- THEY ARE THEY ARE GOING TO BE UTILIZING THE LOCAL AGENCIES THAT THEY HAVE. OUT IN THE IN THE IN THE COMMUNITIES THE LABOR AGENCIES THAT THEY HAVE OUT THERE- AND IT IS PRIMARILY IT'S PRIMARILY TARGETED FOR THOSE ON DOCKS BUT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS BUT EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE OF THAT ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FUNDS AND IT'S INTENDED TO. PROVIDE AS SMALL GRANTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY TO ARE. TO PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCES AND THE TRAINING NECESSARY TO BECOME BUSINESS OWNERS FOR THEMSELVES RIGHT I UNDERSTAND SO IN THE FIRST SENATE DISTRICT IF THERE WAS. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WHERE WOULD THEY GO IN MY DISTRICT TO FIND THIS SERVICE IS AT WHAT'S A GUY APPARENTLY THERE'S NOT A STATE AGENCY THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT LIKE YOU WOULD GO TO THE E. D. D. OR TO THE- WHERE WOULD YOU GO WHAT WHAT PHYSICAL PLACE WOULD ONE OF THESE PEOPLE GO- IF THEY WANTED TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET. YEAH I CAN GET I THINK I CAN GET BACK WITH YOUR OFFICE ON THE SPECIFICS BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S LOCAL EDUCATION- OFFICES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT CAN DOWN PROVIDE THE SERVICES THE PORTS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND THEY CAN APPLY THERE FOR THOSE FOR THOSE AND THOSE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES. OKAY I WOULD I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HOPEFULLY BEFORE TOMORROW- AND ACTUALLY IN MY DISTRICT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THIS PLACE IS IN SENATE DISTRICT ONE PLEASE. WE'LL FOLLOW UP. APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND YOUR CONCERN FOR MAKING SURE THE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS YOU DISTRICT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT RESOURCE THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE COLLEAGUES WE WILL MOVE ON. AB EIGHTY THREE HOUSING. YES EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE IS- TRAILER BILL RELATED TO BOTH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND I WILL MENTION THREE OF THE PROVISIONS UP FIRST IS RELATED TO NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAY REMEMBER THIS FROM BUT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR EVEN LAST YEAR IN THE SUMMER AND FALL WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND INITIALLY THE IDEA HAD BEEN TO PUT THIS MONEY INTO IT TRUSTS. OW THE PROPOSAL THAT IS BEFORE YOU IS TO DEDICATE OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL ON THAT IS REQUIRED ASKING THE COURT TO BE SPENT- CHECKS MILLION. A HOUSING COUNSELING. AND IT SHOULD BE CAL A- HOUSING FINANCE EIGHT NINE IT'S AGENCIES I'M AND THEN THE BALANCE THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND THAT WOULD BE FOR PROGRAMS LIKE OBJECTION DEFENSE IN OTHER RENTER. IT'S SO THAT'S ONE ELEMENT A SECOND IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS BILL IS THE- ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS AND NOW THEY JUST. AREAS OF THE OVERALL BY PACKAGE THAT HELP COMBAT. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY A PRIORITY IN THE TIME THAT CALLED IT IN THE NEEDS FOR. PHYSICAL DISTANCE CHANGE- BUT HERE INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. ACCORDING TO THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENTION ALSO KNOWN AS HAPPY- THAT FORMULA A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE BIG THIRTEEN. EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO COUNTIES AND NINETY BILLION DOLLARS. HERE I SUGGEST AS WHAT HAPPENED- YOU SEE AN ALLOCATION AMONG THOSE THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS- AND THEN YEAH AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT FOR ALL THAT SPENDING AND ALL OVER HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. THERE IS AN EMPHASIS- INCLUDING MISSPELLED ON REGIONAL COORDINATION. ACTION THEN THE LAST PART OF THIS BILL THAT I LIKE TO MENTION IS THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT PROVIDED FOR PROJECTS FROM TEACH- WHICH AT THE STATE HAS SECURED HOUSING UNITS. FOR OVER TEN THOUSAND- INDIVIDUALS ON AND THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES RELATED TEMPORARY SEQUEL EXCEPTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE IT SECURE REYES ME HOUSING UNITS AS POSSIBLE WHILE WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS. MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT FINO QUESTIONS. THIRTY NIELSEN. IF I'M A THIS. GIVES THE DIRECTOR THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SOME AUTHORITY TO SWAP EXCESS PROPERTIES WHAT THEY WOULD DEEM STATE ACCESS ROPERTY WOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I'VE ALWAYS WARY OF ACCORDING ANY AGENCY MORE AUTHORITY THIS COULD BE A MATTER OF- MUTUAL BENEFIT BUT- THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES HAS A LOT OF POWER AND I'M WORRIED THAT. THROUGH THIS YEAR A AND IN THE AREA OF A HOMELESS HOUSING AND THE LOCATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE ABLE TO SUCH A SWAY. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO CERTAIN THINGS THAT THEY DECIDE SHOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OVERRIDE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE HERE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THESE FLOCK DEALS AT AT THE AT THE ORDERS OF ONE OF THE STEPS IN THE PROCEDURES. BY WHICH TO SWAP IS CONSUMMATED THE THEY HAVE TO HAVE A GOOD MUTUAL AGREEMENT TO AND A CONTRACTOR WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. CENTER NIELSEN LET ME TURN THAT OVER TO YOU CHRIS **** WHO CAN DISCUSS THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER NIELSEN SO TYPICALLY WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING THIS PROCESS TO INTEL IS REALLY THIS IS. A PROCESS THAT WOULD BE ACTUALLY INITIATED BY THE LOCALS BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE- ACCESS TO A LOT OF THE ACCESS STATE LANDS THAT THE LOCALS HAVE- AND SO HOW WE'RE VISION IN THIS WORKING JUST AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL IS ONE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND- THE A- CONVERSATION. THE STATE TO POTENTIALLY- PROPOSED TO SWAP THESE LAND- THESE PIECES OF LAND- ASSESSMENTS ON THE PROPERTIES BOTH BY. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES- THEY WILL CONDUCT THEIR CONDUCT A REVIEW AND DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ON THE PROPOSED PROPERTIES- AND THEN USING THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. AT SIX THANKS FOR THE SCREENING CRITERIA KIND OF TRY TO MAKE SOME OF THE PAYMENTS THERE TO ASSESS THE SIGHTS TO SEE IF EITHER. STATE LANDS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SWAP WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEN FROM THERE IT WILL BE A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN BOTH STATE AND- THE LAW. GOVERNMENTS TO. YOU KNOW THE STATUS TE INTEREST. AND THE TIME FRAMES FOR WHICH WE WILL BE DOING THAT AND THEN ASSUMING THAT WE GOT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD FOR THOSE LANCE WALKS TO TAKE PLACE THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WITH AN ISSUE A NOTICE. TO THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDING A THIRTY DAY NOTICE AND GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. AND TO- WEIGH IN ON THE POTENTIAL LAND SWAPS AND THEN FROM THERE- AS THE TRANSACTION WALKER. THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL AND YOU HAD A GOOD COMMAND OF THOSE STEPS THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SEE NONE WILL MOVE ON TO A. B. EIGHTY FOUR CAL STARS CALPERS SERVICEMEN OFTEN. AB EIGHTY FOUR INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVISIONS RELATED TO BOTH CALPERS AND CAL STARS AND SOME OF THEM DATE BACK TO FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ALLOCATED AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET OUR- LAST YEAR AT THE FIRST THAT'LL MENTION IS THAT AS PART OF THAT BUDGET AGREEMENT- AT THE STATE HAD PLANNED TO ALLOCATE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CALPERS THESE WILL BE PAYMENTS. ABOVE AND BEYOND- WHAT'S THE ACTUAR AWAY REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THIS- TRAILER BILL THIS WILL NO LONGER BE MAKING THAT EXTRA PAYMENT GIVEN THE FISCAL PRESSURES THAT THE STATE IS UNDER- AND WE NEED TO MAKE MEET ITS COMMITMENTS TODAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT BY KID ALLOCATED AN EXTRA TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREDIT BACK A MINUTE TO HELP OFFSET THE PAYMENTS OF THE STATE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO MAKE IN BOTH THE BUDGET. AND THE YEAR AFTER BUDGET SO WE CAN NOT IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE THING THAT THIS BILL DOES GIVEN SOME OF THE PRESSURES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY WITH REGARD TO OUR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL FUNDING IS A PROVIDE BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THREE POINT THREE DAHLE IN BOTH HERS. RELEASED FIRST DISTRICT AND ALLOWS TO APPLY I TO PAY MAYES THE NEXT THREE YEARS DAY BYE BYE IT JUST ROLE WE MORE MEDIA GIVEN COMPRESSORS BUT THE SCHOOL THIS ARE ON AS WELL I AND THIS IS ALSO A CO WITH THE ONE YOU FREE IN CAL STIRS AT RATE- THAT THE STATE WOULD PAY IN TERMS AT THAT RATE TO THE CAL STIRS SYSTEM I SHOULD ADD HOWEVER THAT UNDER PROPOSITION TWO THE STATE IS CONTINUING TO MAKE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS- CASTERS. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT AT AT THIS BILL HAS IS IT ALLOWS- ALLOWANCES FOR THE PERSONAL WEEK PROGRAMS TO REFLECT- SAVINGS ARRANGEMENTS I KNOW WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT BARGAINING- LATER IN THE AGENDA- BUT I SHOULD MENTION THAT THAT. THAT BILL WELL. THIRTY MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER RESPOND THE FUND- DARN- ARE PREPAYMENT OF SIX BILLION- THAT MOVE DIDN'T TAKE LONG TO GET PULLED BACK IT'S- VERY UNFORTUNATE HI I'M- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT CALPERS- AND THEIR- CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT THE LAST. FEW WEEKS. HE INTENDS TO. BORROW A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO INVEST. IN PRIVATE EQUITIES AND OUR ARM I'M WONDERING IF SIR IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING THAT- I JUST WANNA. REMIND YOU THAT ORANGE COUNTY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION BECAUSE IT BORROWED TO INVEST. AND I I'M JUST WONDERING IF PERHAPS CALPERS IS. TAKING EXTREMELY UNNECESSARY HIGH RISKS TO TRY TO. ACHIEVE A 7% RATE OF RETURN AND I. I'M JUST CURIOUS OF IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THAT- AND WHAT YOU YOU MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT THAT- PROPOSAL. YES SENATOR MORE A LOT SO WE DON'T WHILE OF COURSE FOLLOWING AT NEWS IN DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS AND PROPOSALS I FINANCE WE DON'T REALLY- WAY AND ON THE SPECIFIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY- THAT CALPERS OR CAL STIRS. IS MAKING WOULD CALLOUSED WE SAID ACCESS ON THE BOARD BUT NOT SO CALPERS I'M SO I CAN'T REALLY OFFER ANY COMMENT BEYOND TO SAY THAT WE CERTAINLY FOLLOW THE NEWS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DIFFERENT PORTS ARE PROPOSING. THEN MAYBE JUST. TO GIVE A LITTLE FREE ADVICE- WE TALK ABOUT CALPERS ON OCCASION HERE AND WE WISH HIM TO PUT A LOT OF BLAME ON. BANKING INSTITUTIONS FOR THE GREAT RECESSION. ARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE BIG SHORT. BUT AT THAT TIME CALPERS HAD BORROWED A LOT OF MONEY TO INVEST IN REAL ESTATE. AND REAL ESTATE PRICES DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AND THEY HAD TO. UNLOAD A LOT OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND RECOGNIZE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES. SO CALPERS IN RECENT HISTORY HAS A- HAS AT LEAST ONE. MASSIVE LOSS IN WE CAN'T JUST ASSUME THAT TAXPAYERS ARE GONNA. MAKE UP THOSE LOSSES BY FORCING THE STATE TO MAKE HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOR FUTURE YEARS IF THOSE. GAMBLES IF I COULD USE THAT TERM- DON'T DON'T PAY OFF SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT SO THAT. WE DON'T COME BACK HERE WITH A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MISTER VISWANATHA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR MORALE. YES THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO JUST. PIGGY BACK ON WHAT SENATOR MORE LACKEY SAID I AM TOO CONCERNED ABOUT CALPERS BE IN ON THAT COMMITTEE AND- THERE'S BEEN SOME OTHER THINGS TOO- THE GENTLEMAN WHO I THINKS AHEAD OF A CALPERS. TRIED SHORTING THE MARKET LAST YEAR IN ANY POLL OUT EARLY AND IF HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT THEY WERE MADE ABOUT A 13100% RETURN ON OUR MONEY SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT'S AN ORGANIZATION AND CONTINUES TO MAKE. ONE A STEAK AFTER THE OTHER. AND LET MY RETIREMENTS NINE CALPERS THANK YOU. WELL AS A NEW MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE A RETIREMENT AT ALL I GUESS YOU YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BETTER THAN ME. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO AB EIGHTY EIGHT PUBLIC SAFETY. THE ELEMENT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY BELL OF THAT PROBABLY RECEIVE THAT THE MOST ATTENTION ARE THE RESULTED FROM THE MOST DISCUSSED SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE IS REGARDING BE PRISON CLOSURE IS THAT THE- GOVERNOR PROPOSED- IN THE NAY REVISION AND WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND SO UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL- DE AT STATE WOULD BE OBLIGATED THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO IDENTIFY. FIRST PRISON FOR CLOSURE BY JANUARY TENTH OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND A SECOND PRISON FOR CLOSURE BY JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN THE PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER THAT THIS IS OF COURSE. TRENDS THE PLAN- CAN'T TO CLOSE TO STATE OWNED CHRISTIANS OVER THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST. SO THAT'S ONE MAJOR ELEMENT OUT THIS BILL- THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A- WHAT'S UNDERSTAND THE BOX BUT A PROVISIONS FOR. POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS PSYCHOLOGIST- REGARDING WHETHER THEY CAN INQUIRE ABOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY OF ANY OF HEIR APPLICANTS DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IT ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS INCLUDING EXPANDING THE ABILITIES FROM A COURT APPEARANCES AND ALSO WITH REGARD TO PAROLE WHICH I KNOW IT'S BEEN. ANOTHER BIG ITEM OF DISCUSSION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHING A NEW MAXIMUM TERM FOR PAROLE FOR MOST OF FACTORS COMING FROM STATE PRISON. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. SINCE MEMBERS. THIRTY NIELSEN LET ME JUST TELL THEM MISTER VERSION NOT THE NOT GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVELY UP PUBLISHING THAT FROM. THANK YOU FOR SHARING FIRST CENTER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- WHAT APPEARS. IS IN THIS BILL WHICH SHOULD BE A POLICY BILL NOT IS REGARDING THE BANNING OF A NEW CLASS OF FIRE ARM. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS FARM IS EVEN AVAILABLE. IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS POINT. YES CENTER MELENDEZ LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- IT'S GOING TO BE EITHER ERIN EDWARDS OR CLINT CALLUM US LET ME TURN OVER TO CLICK CALLUM AND THAT HE MAY TURN IT OVER CARING TO OFFER THE DETAILS ON THAT QUESTION FOR THAT FIREARMS. REGULATIONS IN THIS BILL. THE CALENDAR PERMITTED FINANCE YEAH ACTUALLY ERIN EDWARDS IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE PERSON DISCUSSES COMPONENT. HI ERIN AND WORKS WITH THE PRIVATE A FINANCE- THANK YOU- SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION- SO THE LANGUAGE IS DESIGNED TO CLOSE WHAT IS CURRENTLY A LOOPHOLE IN STATE LAW. THERE ARE CLASSES- FIRE OR DID YOU NOT FALL. NEATLY INTO ONE OF THE EXISTING- CATEGORIES FOR FIREARMS THAT ARE- THAT THE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO REGULATE UNDERSTAND LAW- WHICH ARE RIFLES- SHOT ONES- STALLS- THE THESE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW- TYPE OF FIREARMS- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE. AVAILABILITY CURRENTLY IN THE STATE BUT- IT IS IN OUR VIEW A LOOPHOLE THAT NEEDS TO BE CLOSED- BECAUSE THESE WEAPONS- ARE SIMILAR TO ASSAULT WEAPONS- IN CAN POSE A SIGNIFICANT. THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND SO THAT IS WHY WE LEAVE INCLUDED THIS- LANGUAGE AND ARNOLD SELLABLE TO CLOSE THAT THAT WILL CALL SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN OPINION ON. IDEOLOGY HERE BUT THIS IS A POLICY MATTER THIS IS IN A BUDGET MATTER SO WHY IS IT IN THIS TRAILER BALLOTS THIS IS. THIS IS A BRAND NEW POLICY. SO SURE SO I HAPPEN TO SPEAK TO THAT AND THE REASON THAT IT'S IN- TRAILER BILL IS BECAUSE THERE IS FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET- FOR THE- DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DEVELOP AND ENFORCE THESE REGULATORY OF THIS NEW RECORD THESE NEW REGULATORY MEASURES ON THESE FIREARMS AND SO IT IS THERE IS AN ACCESS TO THE BUDGET. THIRTY NIELSEN. BY SENATOR ROCK. MADAM CHAIR I DO HAVE TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT I WAS VERY OFFENDED. AND ANGRY. TOO OFTEN NOW. MAJOR POLICY IS SLIPPED IN TO THE BUDGET AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I FIND YOUR REASONING VERY DEFICIENT. AND FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ARROGANCE TO SAY WELL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE JUST WANT TO DO AND THAT'S A DANGEROUS AND- IF I DON'T EVEN AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE POINT IS CIRCUMVENTING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS IS REPREHENSIBLE IN MY SIGNAL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AT THE HORSESHOE IS THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THAT MAYBE AND GET THE VOTES. IT'S A GREAT DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THESE GAMES BEING PLAYED IN THE DARK OF NIGHT. SENATOR OFF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. FINANCE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A LECTURE ABOUT POLICY IN BUDGET BILLS BECAUSE- HAVING BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARS IT SEEMS IF WE LIKE POLICY IT'S OKAY AND IF WE DON'T IT'S NOT BUT WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION DOES ENGAGE IN THE- IN POLICY INITIATIVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. IN BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS I DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TREAT IT LIKE A POLICY COMMITTEE IN A POLICY DISCUSSION. AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. ON THE POLICY ISSUES AND I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT THE COMING UP A LITTLE LATER IN THE AGENDA- BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO EXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY WHAT THESE WEAPONS ARE. AND CALL AND REFERRING TO THEM AS SIMILAR TO ASSAULT. WEAPONS FRANKLY DOESN'T CUT IT FOR ME SO THIS IS A POLICY ISSUE YOU'RE ASKING US TO VOTE ON IT. SOMEONE STEP UP AND TELL ME WHAT EXACTLY THIS IS BECAUSE I TRIED TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF THE OTHER NIGHT. ANY TAKERS FINANCE. ALTERNATE OVER BACK TAILORED EDWARDS. SERVICE CENTER I THINK WE WILL HAVE MIGHT HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC DETAILS- THE- AND- THE WAY THE LINE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT IT IS TO CRITICALLY- DEFINED TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE FIREARM- IN SO REALLY GETS DOWN TO I THINK SOME FAIRLY TECHNICAL DETAILS ABOUT HOW THE FIREARMS DESIGNED- AND I THINK I WOULD NEED TO. GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE SPECIFIC DETAILS I DON'T OUT OF TURN TRIPS NOT HAVING ALL THE VERY SPECIFIC NUANCES OF WHO SHOULD WE JUST PUT THIS TRAILER BILL ON THE SHELF UNTIL YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT. AT THAT EIGHT THIS ONE OUT AND WE WILL- WILL DEFINITELY GET BACK WITH THOSE DETAILS BUT- WE DO BELIEVE I WON I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE DO BELIEVE I KNOW THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION HERE BUT- WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO IMPLEMENTING AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED- THAT. DOJ PROVISIONS RELATED TO REGULATION OF FIREARMS THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND IT'S A PRIORITY FOR. MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFIC. ACTIONS THAT THEY CAN BE HIGHLY TECHNICAL IN TERMS OF HOW THESE WEAPONS ARE DEFINED IN FACT IT'S AUSTIN- THE LOOPHOLES IN THESE DEFINITIONS- THAT TRIED THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE WEAPONS IN THE FIRST. PLACE SO WE'LL MAKE SURE TO CALL BACK ON THOSE DETAILS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY IN ITS OWN RIGHT BUT IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTING THE BUDGET PACKAGE. WITH YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT DO NOT MISS THIS ONE OFTEN. YOU'RE ASKING US TO A- AND PROMISE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BACK TOMORROW. AFTER THE VOTE WAS EXPLANATION. I'M OKAY WITH THAT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH NUMBERS I AM NOT OKAY WITH IT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH POLICY. AND SOMEONE TO GET THE MESSAGE DOWNSTAIRS IF YOU'RE GOING TO INSERT POLICY INTO A BUDGET. WHETHER IT'S A BUDGET OR TRAILER BILL YOU OR SOMEONE BETTER BE ON THE LINE TO EXPLAIN THE POLICY TO THOSE OF US WHO LIKE TO READ AND APPRECIATE KNOWING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO. WHEN WE VOTE ON IT NO I'M INCLINED TO VOTE ON THIS TRAILER BILL BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON WHEN I CAST MY BALLOT. SO WORD TO THE WISE I DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE ON THIS- OTHER ISSUES BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION ARE INSERTING POLICY ROTH POLICY UNTETHERED TO ANY SINGLE LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET. IN A TRAILER BILL. NOW I'LL CLOSE MY MOUTH AND LET US GO ONE. SENATE ROTH I THINK IT'S FAIR TO ASSUME THAT ALL OF US WANT TO KNOW THE CONTENT OF WHAT WE VOTE ON- SO WITH THAT- MISTER THIS ONE OFF AND I WOULD WOULD HAVE TO INSIST THAT- YOU ARE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON YOUR DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW GET BACK TO US BEFORE WE TAKE THIS ITEM UP ON THE FLOOR TOMORROW. WILL BE SURE TO HAVE SENATE BUDGET STAFF COORDINATE WITH YOU THIS EVENING TO TALK ABOUT TIMING SENATOR BAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PRISON CLOSURE AND THEN THE- ELDERLY PAROLE AND COMPASSIONATE RELEASE I AM- I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT- WE HAVE. THREE IS MY UNDERSTANDING THREE FACILITIES THAT HAVE A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE CALL BAD NINETEEN CASES THERE ARE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT THE CURRENT- COUNT. OF CASES ARE AND DO WE HAVE A- PROGRAM TO COMPREHENSIVE WE TEST ALL OUR FACILITIES- HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TESTED SO FAR- THE ISSUE REGARDING ELDERLY AND PAROLE COMPASSIONATE RELEASE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE VERY LOGICAL. TO ALLOW PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE HIGH RISK CATEGORY. ACCORDING TO OUR OUR HEALTH. THE EXPERTS THAT THEY SHOULD BE STILL IN THOSE FACILITIES- WELL WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THEM TO HAVE OF THE CALL AD NINETEEN ILLNESS. CAN I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THOSE FACILITIES AND A AND- I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONES ARE THE WORSE BUT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HOUSES CLOSELY MODERATORS- THE REASON I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I DON'T THINK- WE'VE ADDED COOLEY HAD A RESPONSE. OF THE LAST WEEK'S SITUATION- IN IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT. IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS WE SHOULD HAVE MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACHES TO DEALING WITH OUR CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONS FACILITIES. IN TERMS OF MAKING THEM AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR LEASE FOR THE ADDRESS- INMATES AND STAFF. AS WELL AS- OF ALL THE OTHER STAFF AND INMATES THAT ARE IN THE FACILITIES. FACILITIES AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE GOING HAVE. UNKNOWN UNKNOWN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE MAY HAVE TO SPEND IN THE FUTURE. IF WE DON'T GET A REAL GOOD HANDLE ON THIS SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE A- CLOSE CLOSER MONITORING AND REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE THE BUDGET. COMMITTEE AND THEY'LL POLICY COMMITTEES ON THIS ISSUE. GIVE ME A RESPONSE TO SENATOR BILL. FROM FINANCE YES I'LL SAY VERY SIMPLY WE APPRECIATE THAT POINT AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS TOP OF MIND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING MORE BROADLY IN TERMS AS THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR PRISONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN IN CLOSE QUARTERS ASSET TESTING IS ALREADY GOING ON OF COURSE BUT- ALSO WORKING ON A STRATEGY FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THIRTY WILL IN THE FUTURE MY COW. THANK YOU I JUST NOT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY- COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE THAT. AS I STATED THIS IS A POLICY ISSUE AND- I GUESS THE RESPONSE OF SAYING WE'LL GET BACK TO WHICH WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY DURING THIS HEARING I DON'T THINK IS SUFFICIENT SO I WONDER IF WE COULD GET ANY ANSWER THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE CAN GET AN ANSWER. BEFORE WE END THIS BUDGET HEARING TONIGHT WE'LL WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH. I STATE I WOULD. HAVE BUDGET STAFF WAS GOING TO COORDINATE WITH THEM AND SO BEFORE THE HEARING I'LL BE ABLE TO LET YOU ALL KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THEM.

NO THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU MADAM BUDGET CHAIR FOR- INSISTING THAT WE ACTUALLY GET AN ANSWER- IN A TIMELY MANNER. YEAH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND MY COLLEAGUES FRUSTRATION THAT AT LEAST IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S IN A- AT A BILL BEFORE US AND FOR THESE ARE TRAILER BILL THESE ARE STILL BILLS. THAT ADMINISTRATION HE SAID BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE STAFF IS ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING THAT'S THE CONTENT IN THE BILL. NOT SAYING BUT WHEN I HAVE THE ANSWER I'M GOING TO YOU KNOW GET BACK TO YOU TOMORROW.

THAT IN THIS CASE AND I AGAIN I WILL WELCOME WENDY. BERMAN FINANCE PROVIDES US BUT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS THERE'S PARTICULAR GUN MANUFACTURER WHO HAS MANUFACTURED A NEW WEAPON AND THAT WEAPON WAS DESIGNED TO GET AROUND CALIFORNIA'S ASSAULT WEAPON LAWS NOW BY VIEW THIS AS A CONFORMITY TO EXISTING POLICY NOT SOMETHING NEW IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT. BUT RATHER WE ARE TRYING TO KEEP AHEAD OF MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE TRYING TO KEEP AHEAD OF US SO AGAIN I WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS EXPLANATION BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT IS.

MR DOLLIES MICHAEL THANK YOU CHAIR. I RECOGNIZE ME FOR APPRECIATE THAT I SEE THE A AND THERE'S A DEADLINE EXTENT FOR THE HIGH RAIL TWENTY TWO BIZ PLAN TO THE END OF YEAR I UNDERSTAND IT THE WARTY IN TEN TO ENTER INTO A COUPLE VERY EXPENSIVE CAR. WITH ATTACHED THIRTY MADE ITS- THIS WOULD FURTHER COMMIT CALL. THE PRO. WITH CA THAT OUT OF WITH NO REAL FUNNY PLAN. WINDOWS MINUTES. EXPECTED AUTHORITY ENTER. INTO THESE CRUNCH BE. OR AFTER THE FINAL. OF THE- PLAN. WELL THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TIME TO WEIGH IN BEFORE THESE CONTRACTS ARE EX. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MARC MERO. THE WORKING TO FINANCE AND UP SO IN TERMS THE CONTRACTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THIRTY IS COULD RETURN OF YOUR SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER PLEASE. YOU HEAR ME NOW YES THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SO YEAH THE AUTHORITY WORKING TOWARDS THE FEDERAL DEADLINE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL SECTION. IN AS IT IN A BOOK TO BE. FOR YOU KNOW FOR A FOR HEARING INTO. PROVIDED FROM TO THE AND- AND RIGHT THAT BEFORE THE FINALIZATION OF THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT WAS THE QUESTION SO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING HERE THAT IS INTENDED TO STOP THEM FROM PURSUING THIS CONTRACTS- I THINK THEY'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THOUGH TO- TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS BEFORE PROCEEDING. RIGHT WELL I WOULD I WOULD HAVE A CONCERN THAT WE WOULD. WE WOULD HAVE A THIRTY YEAR-MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT BEFORE WE HAVE THE BUSINESS PLAN FINALIZED IT IT SEEMS TO BE BACKWARDS TO MEAN I. I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO WEIGH IN AFTER WE SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN ON A THIRTY YEAR CONTRACT. WE NEED TO EXTEND THAT DEADLINE TIME SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THE BUSINESS PLAN BEFORE WE AGREE TO IT OF A VERY LATE THE CONTRACT. BUT MY MIND MAY NEVER BE COMPLETED. IF I COULD JUST CHIME INCIDENT TO DOLLY- MESSAGE I'M GETTING FROM BUDGET STAFF- THE BUSINESS PLAN DELAY GIVES US TIME TO REVIEW- AND COMMENT THE CURRENT TIME LINE MEANS THE CONTRACT WOULD BE AWARDED UNTIL JANUARY IN THE BIDS ARE DUE IN SEPTEMBER. AGAIN MIKE MY QUESTION IS THAT'S GREAT BUT I WANT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I DON'T WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T DO THE CONTRACT BEFORE YOU THE BUSINESS PLAN. THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN. AND THE CONTRACT IS NOT SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE BUSINESS PLAN WOULD COME OUT THANK YOU WHAT I THOUGHT I JUST READ BUT OKAY. ANY OTHER. THIRTY MORE LOT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER MONROE MAYBE YOU HELP ME TO FEEL LIKE AMENDED THE BROKERED BUT WHY IS SO DE ABOUT PREPARING A BUSINESS PLAN FOR SPEED. AND WHY IT NEED TO BE. TO BE CLEAR IS A LOT. ASK SO THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS- A PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION- THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE APPELLATE MOSTLY COME FROM THE ASSEMBLY- THEY HAD WANTED- YOU KNOW THE LAST BUSINESS PLAN CAME OUT- AND THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN RATHER CAME OUT. JUST BEFORE THE COVERAGE CRISIS STAR. IN SO. I THINK THERE'S- ABOUT. TAKING INTO CONSIDER ANY ANY COVERT REAL DELAY IN THE AND I JUST UNDER BETTER AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ASSEMBLY WANTED TO. HAVE THE AUTHORITY MORE TO DO ASSESSED. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT- BEFORE- GIVEN GIVEN NEW INFORMATION THAT IS NOW COMING IN TERMS OF. HOW TO COPE WITH A CRISIS MIGHT IF IT. AND MY SECOND MISTER RELAY TO A WHOLE THE HIGH WAS THERE ARE TRANSFERRED AGENCY THAT ARE. BINDING THAT THERE RIDERSHIP IS DOWN THAT THERE ARE. ADEQUATE TO THE 2% THRESH. A REQUIRED TO THE STATE OUT I AM JUST WONDERING BECAUSE OF SOME IN OF A THAT ARE. AT THAT COLD IT IS NOW THE ONLY THAT RIDERSHIP DOWN IT'S BEEN HISTORIC HAPPENING AND TRENDING. AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE INNOVATION AND HOW CAN THE STATE PARTICIPATE- THERE IS THE IDEA OF PERSONAL RAPID TRANSIT AND NOW WITH SELF DRIVING CARS WE COULD. LITERALLY ORDER A SELF A DRIVERLESS CAR TO SHOW UP ADDRESS AND THEN TAKE USED. BUT WE COULD MAYBE THAT TO VAN WERE WE COULD MAYBE GET A LOT MORE PEOPLE. MOVING OUT TO WITH SMALL VIA VANCE IT SAID. AND THEN HAVING TO WAIT FOR A BIG THAT ARRIVE A- HOUR COULD CERTAIN. DO DURING RUSH HOUR AND PROVIDE SOME AND NEW FROM TRANSIT STATE. SO BOB I'M CURIOUS IF A WAY KIDDING THAT KIND OF THING WITH OUR REGIONAL TO. AUTHORITIES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. A ANY RESPONSE FROM FINANCE ON THEM. THE CIVIC. NO I MEAN I KNOW THAT WE BROTHERS THIS CAN TO LOOK A MULTI MORE APART BUT WHAT'S THIS BILL IS A JUST TRYING TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE OF THE REV COME TO THE STATE FOR. LOCAL TRANCE AGENCY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A VERY SKEWED AND- DISRUPTION IN IN WRITER AND THE FOR BY REVENUES THAT THAT SEEM THE JUST OF DURING THIS. DURING THIS. THANK YOU THIRTY BILL JUST THE I WONDER IF ME FOR THE- HAS IT RELIEF PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW IS NOT A ASKING SOME OF FOR MY BUT IT HOUSING FOR. MORE FLEX AND MORE UNDERSTAND ABOUT. THE TIMES THAT WE IN. TO HELP ARE TRANSIT SYSTEM AND CAL. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE GO THERE ARE GOING TO GET BACK TO WORK THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO GET TO WORK AND THEY GET TO WORK IF- THEY'RE NOT WEALTHY AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE JUST GETTING A NEW JOB OR GETTING BACK TO WORK THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO USE A LOT OF TRANSIT. SO WE HAVE TO GET THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS READY. TO PERFORM FOR THOSE HOPEFUL REVIVAL WE HAVE IN THE ECONOMY AND- I AM VERY STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE STATUTORY RELEASE I THINK THEY COULD DO IT EVEN MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THE HELP. THE TRANS YEAH. BILLS BECOME STATE. AND HE PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. OF IN A MANNER YOU KNOW THE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON TRANSIT SHOW THE DOG. OF ALL THE THINGS THAT- HELP PEOPLE. GET OUT OF POVERTY ACCESS TO JOB. IS THE TOP WAY TO GET OUT OF POVERTY. AS FOR THE STUDY BY HARVARD OTHER OTHER OF SOCIAL SOCIAL SCIENTISTS THE HAVE STUDIED COMPARE THE DIFFERENT WE WAYS OF GETTING OUT OF POVERTY ACCESS TO A JOB. HAVING A WAY TO GET TO WORK. IS SO IMPORTANT THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA KEEP THE SURVIVAL WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO RE INVENT THINGS GO TO CHANGE THEN I'M ADAM ALSO POINTING OUT THAT. HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS IS A REQUIREMENT. TO PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES EVERY TWO YEARS- THEIR BUSINESS PLAN AND THEY WERE DUE TO PRESENTED IN JUNE SO THIS IS ACTUALLY JUST FIVE MONTHS. A FIVE MONTH OF DELAY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE REVIEW THIS EVERY TWO MONTHS OR EVERY TWO YEARS EXCUSE ME. AND I THINK IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE IN- THEY HAVE A DRAFT PLAN THAT THEY PUBLISH BEFORE THE- THE VIRUS SITUATION SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PLAN THAT THEY HAVE DRAFTED WHICH I'M SURE WILL CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND DECEMBER BUT YOU CAN. SEE THERE ARE DROPPED PLAN IT'S AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO THE DID HE ANTICIPATE THIS FINAL DELIVERY OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BUSINESS PLAN THE- THAT THAT'S NOW BEEN EXTENDED TO DECEMBER. DO WE ANTICIPATE ANY. THIRTY CHANGER RENEWED EMPHASIS BETWEEN THE DRAFT IN THE FINAL TO ADDRESS THE BOOK AND ISSUE IN LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE IN THIS SPEAKER IS PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY TO. CONTINUE PRIORITIZING- COMMUTER INTER REGIONAL RAIL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO IS ARE ANY OF THOSE ISSUES ANTICIPATED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS UPDATED BUSINESS PLAN. I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT THE- WHAT HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY OF WILL BE LOOKING AT- I KNOW THAT. WAY AND- BACK IN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE- OF THE FUNDING WAS ALREADY ALLOCATED TO LAW TO THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS. AND SO AND MIGHT MIGHT OUR STANDING AS OF THE LAST LAST BUSINESS PLAN IS THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL NEED ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT IT CURRENTLY HAS- TO COMPLETE THE SECT. THE SECTION THAT HAS BEEN A BY THE ADMINISTRATION BUT- BUT I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVES SO THEY'LL BE- CONSIDERING. I GUESS I WOULD JUST FOR SOME KIND OF FEEDBACK EITHER DEAL WITH OR- IF. ITSELF ON HOW WE- THAT OCCUR AT THAT WE HAVE TRANSFER. CHAIR HERE AND WE ALL SORTS SUB CHAIR HERE BUT- FOR ALL OF US AND CAL. I THINK WE'RE EAGER TO SEE WHAT THE UPDATE ENTAILS THANKS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS HAVE FOR. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE LET'S TRANS TO A. B. NINE TWO REESE. WITH BIT SO NOT YES NINETY TWO IS RESOURCE BAIL AND ALSO IN DID VERSIONS THIS BILL MENTION TO IT NOW FIRST WHICH I KNOW HAS BEEN ACTIVE WITH THE LARGEST CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE- ALLOWING EARLY ASKED A ONE YOU'RE TO SECURE. THIS IS FROM THIS WATER CONTROL UNDER SIR PASTOR FROM ACTED ON THE INVITE WORK EASTER PLACE SO WE'RE HAPPY TO MORE ABOUT AND SO AS IT JUST REQUIRE AND CLARIFICATIONS REGARDING THE LATTER BATTERY CLEAN ON SO ARE THE TWO THAT HAS I KNOW OF A GENERALIZED. BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ON ANY OF. THE FACILITATION OF FUNDING. FOR MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL LANDS THAT HAVE HIGH FIRE RISK IN THEM SO. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME KIND OF COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH US FOR SERVICE I'M JUST WONDERING. HOW MUCH THE STATE ANTICIPATES- THE SUBSIDY. TO THESE FEDERAL PROJECTS TO BE. YES CENTER STERN YOU'RE CORRECT THIS IS FOR- FORCE MANAGEMENT ON FEDERAL LANDS LET ME ACTUALLY TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE STEVEN BENTSEN AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN THE MOST DETAIL. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN STEVEN BENSON APARTMENT FINANCE. I DON'T KNOW OF THOUGHT MY HAND EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF FUNDING IS CURRENTLY GOING INTO THE FEDERAL PORTION OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING DONE. YOUR GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW- THE WAY THE AGREEMENTS WORK OF COURSE IS THAT- THE STATE IS ABLE TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE FOR SERVICE. SO THAT WE CAN TREAT. FEDERAL LANDS THAT ARE YOU KNOW COME ALONG- PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE STATE FEDERAL. AND EVEN SOMETIMES PRIVATE LAND. YEAH AND SO. I AM I COULD WORK WITH CAL FIRE GET SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL IN TERM OF WHAT WE THINK WE'RE SPENDING IN TERMS OF TREATING ON FEDERAL LANDS- THE ISSUE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THIS IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS IS THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE AUTHORIZED TO SAIL TO SELL THE TIMBER HARVESTED OFF OF THESE FEDERAL LANDS BUT WE DON'T HAVE A FUND IN WHICH DEPOSIT THE REVENUES THAT WOULD COME FROM THAT. SO THIS LANGUAGE IS INTENDED TO SET UP THAT FUNDS THAT WE CAN START SELLING THE TIMBER THAT'S HARVESTED DISPARITIES FORCE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS AND THEN USE THAT REVENUE TO GO TOWARDS EITHER THE PROJECTS FROM WHICH THE CHAMBER IS HARVESTED OR OTHER SIMILAR PROJECTS THAT COULD BE ANYWHERE ACROSS THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT THE REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED THAT. COULD BE ANYWHERE YOU KNOW FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WE GET FROM. A DEMONSTRATION STATE FOR US- NUMBER SALES. JUST IS IT EXCLUSIVELY DO YOU ANTICIPATE OR IS THAT THE TRAILER LANGUAGE HERE DOES IT EXCLUSIVELY LIMITATION. LIMIT THOSE REVENUES TO SOLELY GO BACK TO PROJECTS ON THOSE FEDERAL LANDS OR OR IS IT ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN OTHER FIRE MITIGATION FORCE HEALTH CATEGORIES. IT WILL BE SPECIFIC TO GOING TO PROJECTS- ON FEDERAL LAND WITHIN A GOOD NEIGHBOR AUTHORITY AGREEMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THIRTY FOR THE QUESTION THIRTY NIELSEN. THIRTY NIELSEN. YES JUST THE A MESSAGE TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAIN A VERY VERY MAJOR POLICY WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. IT AFFECTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES THAT SOME OF US IN CALIFORNIA HERE LEGISLATURE DO REPRESENT. IT IS A HUGE HUGE ISSUE. AND IT IS RECKLESS AND REQUIRES FAR MORE THAN JUST A FEW CURSORY MINUTES HERE IN THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS EVENING. PHIL WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIG A LOT DEEPER. INTO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND IT CAN'T BE JUST BRUSHED OFFICE ZERO JUST TO. QUICK ITEM IN THE BUDGET IT'S A MAJOR MAJOR ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR ON I HAVE A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE FOR A ONE CERTIFICATION PORTION OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD TO ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OR A STATEMENT. WHICH IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW BUT BEFORE. COMPLETING THE- CALIFORNIAN BERMAN A QUALITY ACT- REVIEW- AND I'M I'M SENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA LAW AND YET WE'RE GIVING THE STATE WATER BOARD THE AUTHORITY TO JUST WAIVE THAT REQUIREMENT AND ISSUE A CERTIFICATE AND IT THIS PARTICULAR. POLICY CHANGE AFFECTS ONE OFTHE IRRIGATION DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT THAT PROVIDES HYDRO ELECTRIC ENERGY TO A TO RESIDENTS AND- THIS. COULD DETRIMENTALLY AFFECTED THEIR RELICENSING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR. YES SENATOR CABALLERO AGE IS ABSOLUTELY A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND THE WAY THE ADMINISTRATION- IS THINKING ABOUT WHEN IT WOULD APPLY IS ONLY UNDER AT THE RE CERTAIN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AND LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES OR YOUR APPLE ARE. WHO CAN TALK TO THIS. WHERE DO I GO OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO I'LL JUST UNDER. EXISTING LAW- THE STATE OF THE WATER BOARD CANNOT CASES CERTIFICATION UNTIL THE PROJECT GO THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS- THERE'S BEEN SOME RECENT FEDERAL ACTION. NOTHING PROVIDED A ONE YEAR TIME PERIOD FOR ON WHEN THE APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED. SO WHEN THE WATER BOARD WOULD NEED TO MAKE. THE DETERMINATION- AND TO THE EXTENT. THE WATER BOARD DOES NOT MAKE THAT INFORMATION WITH THAT ONE YEAR PERIOD. THEY MAY POTENTIALLY- BASICALLY GATEWAY BUT THEIR AUTHORITY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO PLACE CONDITIONS ON THE PROJECT AS THEY WOULD UNDER UNDER THE LAW AND SO WITH THIS- TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT ALLOWS THE WATER BOARD TO- ISSUE CERTIFICATION BEFORE. THE IT WAS COMPLETED. IN ORDER TO REALLY KIND OF ALLOW THE- AS THE WATER BOARD TO CONTINUE AYE ENFORCING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY LAWS. THE PROJECT WOULD STILL NEED TO CONTINUE GOING TO A SINGLE PROCESS. AND THEN AFTER A SINGLE PROCESS WOULD BE COMPLETED- THE WATER BOARD WOULD BE ABLE TO RE OPEN THE CERTIFICATION AND THEN ADD ADDITIONAL- CONDITIONS BASED OFF OF THE- ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW. AT IF I COULD FALL UP MADAM CHAIR OF THE WITH THEIR IN. THOUGHT GIVEN. TO CREATING AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY FURTHER ALONG DOWN THE LINE. THAT THIS PROCESS COULD DETRIMENTALLY AFFECT. MY UNDERSTOOD I UNDERSTAND THAT IT BE IN IT YOU KNOW IT IT'S- WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT WE'D CIRCUMVENT YOU DOING SYKORA. AND IT IT BOTHERS ME BUT THEN SO LET'S GET PAST THAT AND IT WAS ANY THOUGHT GIVEN. TO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU MAY BE HURTING OTHER POT LICENSING PROCESSES THAT ARE FURTHER ALONG DOWN THE LINE THAT THAT WILL BE IMPACTED. I GUESS THAT WAS PART OF FINANCE WHAT I WOULD NOTE IS THAT THE LANGUAGE IS GENERAL AND APPLIES TO ALL THE POTENTIAL PROJECT THAT WOULD FALL WITHIN THE FOR A ONE WATER QUALITY CERTIFICATION SO WE DIDN'T MAKE ANY KIND OF PROJECT THE CIVIC EXEMPTIONS AND IT DOES PROVIDE FOR MORE CONSISTENT STATE WHAT. COACH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'LL BE BACK. BECAUSE THIS ISN'T GOING WAY AND I'M I AM CONCERNED I'M I'M LOOKING FOR COOPERATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP. THIS IRRIGATION DISTRICT THAT PROVIDES CLEAN. ENERGY TO IT IT'S A RESIDENTS. FAIR ENOUGH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. GOODBYE I'M LOOKING AT OF FIVE FIFTY IF I COULD JUST GIVE A SENSE OF PEOPLE WHO INTENDED AND HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ON THE NEXT TRAILER BILL WHICH IS HIGHER IT IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE ME A SIGNAL. OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW OF YET. YOU WILL HAVE QUESTIONS ON IT GOOD I THINK- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE BEFORE THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND NOT WHEN I WOULD LIE BAD ANY OF THE MEMBERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS ON THE IDC. OKAY SO- BEAUTIFUL WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO AB NINETY THREE. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT COLLEAGUES THIS WILL BE THE IS THE LAST TRAILER BILL WE HEAR BEFORE WE TAKE A THIRTY MINUTE. RECESS FOR DINNER. FOR THE WE HAVE LET'S SAY I HEAR FROM YOU FINANCE ON A. B. NINETY THREE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. ON EIGHTY NINETY THREE AT THE BUDGET OVERALL AND PRESERVE SAID THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT EXPANSION OF THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED LAST YEAR BUT IN ADDITION AS A ROAD RESULT OF THE THREE PARTY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR REFLECTED IN THIS STILL WORKS IT ALSO INCLUDES AN EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TRACK TAX CREDITS- TO FILERS. WHO HAD A INDIVIDUAL TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS ARE ALSO KNOWN AS I CAN FIVE HOURS RATHER THAN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND IT EXPANDS ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE SCHOLARS THAT HAD A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX- SO IF A HOUSEHOLDER OF TYLER HAS A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF SIX THEY'LL BE ELIGIBLE BOTH FOR THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT WITHIN THE EITC. WHICH IS A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR. CREDIT AS WELL AS ANY OTHER PRE EXISTING OR DIFFERENT TAX CREDIT THAT OFFSETS WERE EXPECTING- PROJECTING THAT THE COST OF THIS WILL BE SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A- YEAR. QUESTIONS OF MEMBER SENATE ROBB. THIRTY DORADO ALL SORRY SIDE IN HERE- YES I- I WANT TO OF THANK ALL THE EFFORT THAT WENT INTO MAKING THIS CHANGE AND INCLUDING I TEND FILERS. I TEN FILERS WORK THEIR- REGULAR WORKING MEN AND WOMEN THEY'RE WORKING VERY VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES- AND THEY'RE PUTTING INTO THE INTO THE SYSTEM THERE AGAIN THEIR TAX FILERS SO I'M I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THAT- RECOGNITION IS BEING GIVEN. TO THEM SO THAT THEY COULD APPLY- I WOULD OBVIOUSLY IN THE FUTURE LOOKED TO SEE THAT THEY GET TO THE POINT OF BEING TREATED EQUALLY I AS ALL OTHER ODD TAX FILERS SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AGAIN SO I THE SAME QUESTION ON THIS- PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS I HAD ON THE PREVIOUS A TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO IF YOU. ARE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT AND YOU ARE THE- CAN APPLY FOR THIS EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN SENATE DISTRICT ONE WHERE WOULD YOU GO. SO FOR THIS AT THIS IS DONE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE TAX CODE- SO- AS LONG AS YOU ARE FILING YOUR TAXES- AND YOU MAKE SURE TO APPLY WITHIN WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TAXES THIS PROVISION YOU SHOULD BE RECEIVING THIS CREDIT SO HERE ACTUALLY THE BARRIER IS IN SO MUCH GETTING. FOLKS TO GO OUT THERE AND LOOK FOR THE PROGRAM THAT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT AS WAS THE CASE IN IN MIGHT BE THE CASE IS ON THE OTHER INSTANCES THAT YOU MENTIONED INSTEAD IT SOMEONE WHO. MAY OR NOT MAY NOT MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR REQUIREMENT TO FILE TAXES IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF THEY DID- THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET THIS BENEFIT BECAUSE THE CREDIT IS REFUNDABLE MEANING THAT EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A TAX LIABILITY OF THAT SIZE THEY COULD STILL GET THAT CREDIT THEY FILE THEIR TAXES BUT- I'M TO SOMEONE WANTED MORE INFORMATION FOR THIS THEY COULD GO TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. THE THREE PARTY AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OUT OF REACH THE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHILE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SEVERAL DECADES WE'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR FOUR YEARS AT THE STATE LEVEL LIKE WE. ONLY TO SIXTEEN. I IT'S JUST WELL AS OUR TAXES IN A PRO WILL HELP THE WORD OUT BUT FOR THIS YOU SIMPLY TO YOUR THREE YEAR TAX CO WHEN YOU'RE FINE TAX AND HE'S BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THAT OF DIRECTLY. SO A FOLLOW UP. IN TWO THOUSAND. I IN ASSEMBLY WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE ACTUALLY. READ THE BILL AND- AND I WAS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE ON MY SIDE ALLEN ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS A GREAT IDEA TO. HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE. REALLY NOT PAYING A TAX I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BARKING BUT THERE BELOW THAT. LEVEL OF- THRESHOLD OF PAIN BUT YOU THE THEY EARNED INCOME TAX BASICALLY WAS. THAT INCENTIVIZING THEM TO WORK. AND SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED EARLIER. SO THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS- WERE ACTUALLY LAST. ONE EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT- AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THAT SO MYCOLOGY CHAMBER ONE IS ON THE LINE AND HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES- BUT I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE TWO STAGES OF CHANGES THE FIRST STEP RELATED TO WHETHER IT'S SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS- VERSUS BEING AN EMPLOYEE OF SOMEBODY ELSE- WERE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR THE TAX AS WELL AS THE ORIGINAL. TWENTY FIFTEEN LEGISLATION THAT YOU MENTIONED I BELIEVE THAT IT RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN AGE GROUPS SO WASN'T ANY FILE ARE OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN SO THAT WAS ONE SET OF CHANGES THE SECOND SET OF CHANGES OCCURRED LAST YEAR IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN ACTED. THE EIGHTY BANDED AND BE IN. WHILE FROM I THINK IT'S TOPPED OUT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND EXPAND THAT'S THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THAT IS ABOUT. THE YEARLY INCOME IF YOU IMAGINE SOMEONE WORKING. FORTY HOURS A WEEK AT ABOUT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR WAGE- IT WOULD COME TO ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT KIND OF WORKERS AS A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD OR A FILE OR- WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER THE CREDIT. AND THEN THE OTHER THING THAT OCCURRED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATION. WAS INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES OR HOUSEHOLDS WITH A LEAST ONE CHILD UNDER SIX I'M SO THAT WAS THE SERIES OF CHANGES A LEADING UP TO THIS POINT. THE ONLY CHANGE THAT THIS BUDGET MAKES OTHER THAN PRESERVING AT THE SIZE OF A CREDIT WHICH WAS NOT EASY I KNOW GIVEN THE FISCAL PRESSURES THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH RIGHT NOW. BUT DESPITE PRESERVES THAT AND THE ONLY CHANGES EXTENDING IT TO UNDOCUMENTED EITZEN FILERS WHO HAVE A CHILD OR SEX. BUT THAT'S BASICALLY THE WAY IT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THEN I HAVE ONE LAST FOLLOW UP QUESTION DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT. DON'T FILE IS THAT OUR WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WHEN WE TRY TO JAY CHAMBER ONE TO SEE IF HE HAS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. THIS IS JERRY CHAMBERLAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. PALM AND- I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER. TO THAT I MIGHT SEEK TO ACTUALLY SOMEONE DIFFICULT TO. TO DETERMINE. WHO IS ELIGIBLE BUT NOT. OF THE DOCTOR FINALLY NOW CERTAINLY IT IS. IT IS- THERE ARE. THERE ARE TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT CLEAN THE- FEDERAL CREDIT AND THE STATE CREDIT YOU ARE ELIGIBLE BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER. FOR WHO THAT IS. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT- MY COLLEAGUE CHERYL BROWN AT THE TIME. WAS VERY FRUSTRATED THE FACT THAT PEOPLE THAN FILE AND THERE WAS AN ABILITY FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THE RK INCOME TAX CREDIT BUT- JUST SIMPLY WEREN'T FILING. AND SO- THAT'S THAT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE FOLKS WERE WORKING- AND NOT ABLE TO. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CREDIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU A CENTER FAN. THANK YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY I THINK THE- THE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE- BUDGET BUT PARTICULARLY THE CONTINUING THE OUT REACH MONEY BECAUSE AS WE MAKE CHANGES I THINK IS US SENATE DOLLY MENTION WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW- THAT- THE WHAT. IS OUT THERE AND ALSO WE NEED TO SYSTEM WITH- FILING THEIR TAX RETURNS OFTENTIMES. WELL WHO MAY NOT BE. AS FAMILIAR COMFORTABLE AND BE ABLE TO FIGHT THAT SYSTEM TO APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE ALLOCATED I HEARD FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CONTINUED OUT REACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON THIS. TRAILER BILL. SEEING NONE OF COLLEAGUES WITH THE OUR OF SIX HAVING ARRIVED WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BRIEF A DINNER BREAK RECESS ON IT IS MY EXPECTATION THAT WHEN WE RETURN AT SIX THIRTY- WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY BILL ON AND EXPECT TO HAVE OF FURTHER CLARIFICATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION ON THAT ISSUE BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE ADDITIONAL BILLS WE WILL TAKE A DINNER RECESS AND WE'LL RECONVENE. AT SIX THIRTY AS I COMMITTED RIGHT BEFORE OUR DINNER BREAK WE ARE- GOING TO RETURN TO ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY EIGHT ON PUBLIC SAFETY. I HOPE EVERYONE WHO IS HERE THAT WANTED CLARIFICATION. WE'RE GOING TO ASK. FIRST OF ALL LET ME CLARIFY THAT. I WAS MADE AWARE THAT THIS TRAILER BE ELLIS PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION. BUT THIS TRAILER BILL HAS BEEN. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES WEBSITE THE CURRENT LANGUAGE BEFORE US SINCE MAY FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY. WITH THAT IF FINANCE COULD PROVIDE US WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT PEOPLE WERE THINKING. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WILL SPEAK AT VERY BRIEFLY- AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AARON EDWARDS ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS- SO WE WANT TO HELP PROVIDE OUT WHATEVER INFORMATION IS NECESSARY- IN THIS HEARING TODAY- I THINK THE FIRST THING I'LL START OFF WITH- AT THE TOP LEVELS THAT THE SALE AND TRANSFER OF ASSAULT WEAPONS. IS ALREADY GENERALLY PROHIBITED IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE REALLY ONLY SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE I'M AND THIS POLICY THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES IS WITH GOOD REASON IT'S TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THESE DEADLY WEAPONS. PREVENTING GUN VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDED AS PART OF ITS BUDGET PACKAGE. AND NOW WE KNOW THAT THEIR REASONABLE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ABOUT. WHETHER AN ISSUE LIKE THIS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE. BUT GIVEN HOW WE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE LOOKING AT THIS AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT BUDGETS ARE STATEMENTS OF VALUES ARE. THE SAME GOES WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THIS ISSUE. AND GIVEN THE THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY FROM GUN VIOLENCE THE ADMINISTRATION PLACED AT THE STATE MUST UPDATE ITS LAWS. TO ADDRESS LOOPHOLES IN THE LONGER WAITING TO THE GOVERNMENT'S SPECIAL WEAPONS. I WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW PEOPLE TO POSSESS WEAPONS THAT HAD ALL THE MAJOR FEATURES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF ASSAULT WEAPONS. BUT SIMPLY DO NOT FALL UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED DEFINITIONS. ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE HOW PEOPLE CAN HAVE BABIES RESTRICTIONS IN CURRENT LAW WITH VERY DEADLY RESULTS. AND SO THIS BILL THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF AN ASSAULT WEAPON TWIN CLOTHING EVEN THOSE WEAPONS THAT DO NOT SET THE TYPICAL DEFINITION. OF A RIFLE OR A PISTOL OR SHOCK ON. THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THE CURRENT BANNER RESULT WEAPON. THIS INCLUDES CERTAIN FIREARMS. THAT DO NOT HAVE A FIXED MAGAZINE BUT STILL UNDER CURRENT LAW. MAY NOT BE CLASSIFIED AS ASSAULT WEAPONS. IT ALSO INCLUDES CERTAIN FIREARMS THAT YOU HAD A FIX MAGAZINE BUT NONE THE LESS DISPLAY OTHER FEATURES CHARACTERISTIC OF ASSAULT WEAPONS. INCLUDING A SEMI AUTOMATIC CENTERFIRE FIREARMS THAT IS NOT A RIFLE NOT A PISTOL NOT A SHOT GUN. BUT THAT HAS A FIX MAGAZINE WITH THE CAPACITY TO ACCEPT MORE THAN TEN ROUNDS. SO THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS AN URGENT PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. LET ME TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE NETWORKS WHO CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS. WELL GOOD EVENING- ERIN EDWARDS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME FURTHER DETAIL- ON THIS ISSUE- AND WHY WE THINK IT'S REALLY A CRITICAL- PUBLIC SAFETY. ISSUE THAT WE ADDRESS THIS THIS CALL AND THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. ASSAULT WEAPONS BANS LOT RIGHT NOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- SO I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF. BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN CURRENT STATUTE- IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS AN EXISTING LOCAL THAT WE- FEEL THE NEED TO CLOSE- SO IN PEOPLE CODE SECTION THREE ZERO. FIVE ONE ZERO. ON THE LEGISLATURE HAS. A SPECIFIED A NUMBER OF. WEAPONS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED UNDER THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THERE ARE DOZENS OF WEAPONS SPECIFIED- SOME OF THE MORE COMMON ONES THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH OR LIKE A OUR FIFTEENS. I A. K. FORTY SEVENS. UZIS THESE ARE THE SORTS OF WEAPONS THAT ARE ARE. VERY SPECIFICALLY- DEFINED AS ASSAULT WEAPONS IN EXISTING LAW- HOWEVER THAT THAT ISN'T SUFFICIENT- TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE. NO ASSAULT WEAPONS- BEING- SOLD IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- WE KNOW THAT OF COURSE THERE ARE NEW FIREARM SYSTEMS BEING. DEVELOPED AND PUT ON THE MARKET- CONSTANTLY- AND SO- IT RECOGNIZING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO DEFINE. CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ASSAULT WEAPONS OR CERTAIN FEATURES THAT. ARE ARE PRESENT IN ASSAULT WEAPONS- WHICH- WHICH- WHICH ARE ALSO- PROHIBITED. UNDER THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN SO. I THAT'S IN SEX THREE TRANSACTION THREE EASIER. FIVE ONE FIVE- THAT IS THIS SOME EXAMPLES THAT ARE. THERE ARE NUMBER- BUT- THE KEY IS IN ORDER TO- FALL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF ASSAULT WEAPON UNDER THAT PENAL CODE SECTION. THE FIRE ON NEEDS TO BE DEFINED EITHER AS A PISTOL A RIFLE OR SHOTGUN. AND IT HAS TO HAVE SOME SOME ADDITIONAL AFTER YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE- FOLDING OR TELESCOPING. STOCKS A GRENADE LAUNCHER A FLASH SUPPRESSOR AFFORD PISTOL GRANT- FROM HOLD STOCKS I WILL READ YOU THE ENTIRE SECTION BUT BUT YOU GET THE IDEA- I THINK AND SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARESOME MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE. DELIBERATELY ATTEMPTED TO UNDERMINE- ARE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN BY SPECIFICALLY DESIGNING WEAPONS THAT DO NOT FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF A RIFLE A PISTOL OR SHOCK ON IN THE US ARE NOT. AFFECTED BY THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN THIS IS WHAT I CENTER SKINNER SPOKE TO- EARLIER- IN SO- THERE ARE- AS I SAID. THE TICKET WHERE MANUFACTURER HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THE DESIGN A WEAPON- THAT IS DELIBERATELY INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT THE DEFINITIONS AND SAW WEAPON- UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AND I THINK- IF THE FOR YOU SEE WHAT THIS WEAPON LOOKS LIKE YOU YOU WOULD PROBABLY AGREE THAT APPEARS TO BE AN ASSAULT WEAPON- BY. A REASONABLE DEFINITION- THE WEAPON IN PARTICULAR IS CALLED THE FRANKLIN ARMORY IN TITLE ONE IF YOU IF YOU FEEL THAT ARE ON YOUR PHONES I THINK- NOW PICTURES WERE THOUSAND WORDS IN TERMS OF- REPRESENTING WHAT SORT OF WEAPON WE'RE TRYING TO- GET OUT WITH THIS WITH THIS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE- THE- THE- MANUFACTURER AS I SAID HAS HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO SELL THIS WEAPON- IN CALIFORNIA- AND- DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT THE- IT. WOULD FOR UNDER ANY REASON DEFINITE OF THE SONG WEAPON. THE WAY THEY HAVE A TIME TO START THE LAW IS BY DECIDING THAT WEAPONS. BUT IT'S EXACTLY SIXTEEN AND- ARE IN CURRENT LAW PISTOL IT IS DEFINED AS A WEAPON THAT'S LESS THAN SIXTEEN INCHES SO IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A PISTOL. YEAH AND IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A RIFLE IN PART BECAUSE IT HAS A BUFFER TO- INSTEAD OF A SHOULDER RAST THAT SITS AGAINST HIS SHOULDER ONCE FIRE- AND SO THEREFORE IT DOES NOT. WELL IT'S SORT OF A HYBRID SOME PEOPLE CALL THIS A FULL ODDS ACROSS BETWEEN A RIFLE AND PISTOL BUT AGAIN I'M NOT COVERED BY EXISTING LAW- IN SO- IN ORDER TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE WE HAVE PRESENT THIS THIS THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WHICH WAS THE BULLS PROHIBIT THE SALE OF THAT SPECIFIC WEAPON- AS WELL AS OTHER WEAPONS WHICH MANUFACTURES MADE ATTEMPTS DESIGN BASED ON HISTORY NOW WE KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENS TO GET AROUND OUR EXISTING STATUTES- AND SO THAT IS THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT YOU SEE IN THE- SECTION- THREE ZERO FIVE ONE FIVE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE DO WE- INCLUDE AN EXCEPTION- IN THERE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PURCHASED- FOR OF ENTERTAIN IN SOME WAY THESE WEAPONS- BEFORE- THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THIS OF THIS SIZE. OF THIS NEW DEFINITION IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A SECOND AMENDMENT CONCERNS THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WITH THE WAY THAT THE INITIAL ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS WAS IMPLEMENTED IN STATE LAW- THE REASON THERE'S AN URGENCY TO DO THIS NOW. IS BECAUSE- AT THE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA GUN DEALERS ARE NOT SELLING THESE WEAPONS- FOR THE MOST PART BECAUSE- I'M PRETTY SURE THAT NO ONE IS ONLY. ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T FALL INTO. OF THE US THREE CATEGORIES RIFLE OR COME IN IN ORDER TO AVOID. THE DEALERS ARE SIGNED WEAPONS AND THEY I THE MAIN IF OF THIS. WEAPON HAS NOW. ASKED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND- HILL I CLARIFY IT SYSTEMS TO MAKE IT. ALL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE SO THAT'S IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO IF THAT HAPPENS- WE COLD SEE THESE WEAPONS START TO BE INSTALLED IN LARGE NUMBERS- IN THEIR IT AGAIN IS A SENSE OF URGENCY BECAUSE OF THAT THE NEED. UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT CONSIDERATION TO THE GRANDFATHER FOLKS IN WHO ALREADY POSSESS THESE WEAPONS- THE THERE IS A CONCERN THAT THE WALK LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE WEAPONS- BEFORE THE- THE PROHIBITION GOES AND LESS- SO I THINK I THINK THAT KIND OF. SUMMARIZES WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM IN TERMS OF- WHY WE THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- WE YES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THESE WEAPONS ARE ON THE STREET WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT- IN WE FEEL THAT THERE IS AN URGENCY. TO ACT NOW- SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE MORE MORE CLARITY ON WHAT EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING INSTITUTIONAL. DETAILS EARLIER THANK. YOU MISTER EDWARDS SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU I'D FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND WHILE WE WERE ON BREAK. I DID EXACTLY WHAT HE- SAID WHICH YOU GOOD. THIS TYPE ONE WITH WEAPON AND YOU FIND. THE NOT ONLY THE MANUFACTURE BUT RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S AND OTHER GUN RIGHTS GROUPS BASICALLY PRO CLAIMING IT AS A- LEGAL ASSAULT WEAPON UNDER CALIFORNIA'S LOST SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE EXPLICIT THAT THEIR PURPOSE WAS TO CREATE AN ASSAULT WEAPON. THAT COULD DEFY OUR LAW. BEYOND IT'S A SHAME THAT WELL MAYBE NOT ASHAMED BUT RATHER. IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO WRITE STATUTES SINCE WE IT WOULD BE IMPROPER TO WRITE ONE THAT SAID IN ANYTHING EVER INTENDED TO BE AN ASSAULT WEAPON WILL BE ILLEGAL PERIOD OR ANYTHING ANYBODY WANTED TO HAVE IT IS AN ASSAULT WEAPON WOULD BE ILLEGAL THAT IS AND HOW WE CAN RATES. AND WE HAVE TO DO THESE VERY SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS AND SUCH WHICH THEN OF COURSE THESE MANUFACTURERS JUST RIGGALL IN TRYING TO DEFY SO. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT- PROVISION THAT WILL ALLOW OUR- LOOK STATUTE AS FAR INTENT. TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS TO STAY AS AN ASSAULT WEAPON BAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IRAQ THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW HAVING PLAYED A ROLE IN PROPPING THIS CONVERSATION I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO. THE KNOWLEDGE AND THANK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THAT EXCELLENT TO EXPLANATION SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO PROVIDE. THIRTY NIELSEN. WELL I TO WILL THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE LATE INTO THEY'VE GIVEN US. AN ANSWER OR RATHER I WOULD CALL IT A JUSTIFICATION. I WILL STILL ARGUE. THERE IS A BREACH OF TRUST TO THE PUBLIC THE FORCE THIS UPON US AT THE LAST MINUTE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL VERY IMPASSIONED ON THIS ISSUE AND WHO MAY NOT AGREE. WITH SOME OF THESE CONTENTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED THE OPPORTUNITY. TO INPUT THEIR LEGISLATION AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN. SO IT IS MAYBE. YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOME JUSTIFICATIONS. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM AT THIS POINT. AND MAKE ANOTHER POINT. ABOUT AN AREA THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THE HAS NEGLECTED. AS HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S. THEY ARE PROHIBITED PERSONS THIS IS A STATUTE WERE BY ONE WHO IS A FELON THAT IS USED A WEAPON IN THE COMMISSION OF THEIR COMMITMENT CRIME AND THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCE. COMPLETED THEIR WHOLE SENTENCE. THEY'RE BACK IN THE COMMUNITY NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A WEAPON. WE WERE UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND. OF THESE INDIVIDUALS NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN. TWENTY THOUSAND GUNS. BECAUSE VERY FEW WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE. BUT FOR YEARS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. AND THEN WE KIND OF FUSSED WITH THEM A LITTLE BIT. GAVE THEM A LOT OF MONEY. AT LEAST OVER TWO YEARS TOWARD THE ALMOST THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN I NEVER GOT CLEANED UP I MEAN THE REDUCTION WAS SOMEWHAT GOT DOWN I THINK AS LOW AS TEN THOUSAND. BUT THEY WEREN'T AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING IT WE HAVE ALL KIND OF PREVARICATION. NOW I'M GONNA DROP IT AT THAT POINT EXCEPT TO SAY. HERE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTE KNOWN INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE USE WEAPONS. AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONFISCATE BUT NOW PREEMPTIVELY. BECAUSE OF THESE SUSPICIONS. WE'RE GONNA TAKE ON THIS PARTICULAR WHAT THE- AND IN A MANNER ON WAGE THE LARGER A PUBLIC WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOT OUT THOUGHT. THAT PART I DO NOT THINK THAN YOURS TO THE REPUTATION OF THIS INSTITUTION. NOR DOES IT EQUATE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY. AND LASTLY LET ME SAY DO YOU THINK THE GANGS AND THE CRIMINALS WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THESE WEAPONS. THEY WILL. I ASK NO NO VOTE ON THIS REMINDING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THINK. YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SECURING THIS RESPONSE TO THIS IN REAL TIME IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR. PROVIDING THE EXPLANATION I DO HAVE A QUESTION ON THIS BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK WE MADE A REFERENCE TO WIN. HOW LONG THIS IS BEEN IMPRINT COULD THEY REPEAT THAT. I THINK I DID SIR AT THE TOP OF A LONELY RE OPENED IT HAS BEEN- HOSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WEBSITE SINCE MAY FIFTEENTH. THE DAY AFTER- MAY REVISE WAS RELEASED MAY NINETEENTH SO I APPRECIATE THAT SO IT'S NOT FIRST APPEARING LAST NIGHT OR THIS AFTERNOON. AS HAS BEEN SAID SUGGESTED BY SOME. I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THIS IS APPROPRIATELY WITHIN A PUBLIC SAFETY. PROVISION ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T PROVE WE DON'T HAVE DATA. IS WHOSE CHILD WILL BE PROTECTED FROM FIX SCHOOL SHOOTING BECAUSE THIS WEAPON THAT IS DESIGNED TO DEFY CALIFORNIA ALONG. WE PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO ENFORCE THE PROHIBITION OF THIS WE WILL NEVER KNOW. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS IF THESE ARE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD INTENTIONALLY TO DEFY CALIFORNIA ALONG THEY WILL BE BOUGHT. AND THEY WILL FALL INTO THE HANDS OF BOTH LAW ABIDING IN NON ALONG A BITING RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE FAMILY WHOSE CHILD GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL WHO'S NOT STOPPED. BY AN ASSAULT WEAPON IN THEIR SCHOOL WE'LL NEVER KNOW THAT OUR ACTION TODAY MAY HAVE SAVED THAT LIFE SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS FOR CLARIFICATION SENATOR MORE LOCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A FEW HOBBIES. A WHEN I HAVE TIME FOR THEM BUT TWO OF MY HOBBIES THAT I DO NOT HAVE. THE ARE READING BUDGET BILLS EARLY I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO. SEE WHAT'S REALLY REAL AND WHAT WE REALLY VOTE ON SO I DON'T GRAB. BUDGET BILLS ON MAY FIFTEENTH THE SECOND IS I'D I DID NOT. REQUIRE MY FATHER IN LAW'S A HOBBY OF BEING A GUNSMITH. SO I'M NOT A- EXPERT ON FIREARMS- SO TONIGHT YOU KNOW JUST READING THE BILL- I WENT TO MY IPHONE TO DO A LITTLE RESEARCH GOOGLE. ED A YOU KNOW I KEY AND P. I. F. L. E. S. WHICH IS IN THE REPORT- PARAGRAPH NINE ON PAGE. TWO OF THREE FROM THE STAFF REPORT. I DON'T GET ANY FIREARMS. SO I DON'T KNOW MAYBE IT'S A IT'S A TERM THAT WAS USED JUST TO. THE CREATIVE BY BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BUT IT IT DIDN'T COME UP FOR ME SO. I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION AS WELL AND- I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME. ON THE HOBBY- FOR BECAUSE THIS IS THIS ITEM I DON'T MEAN TO LAUGH BUT- BLOOD DISORDER EXPLAIN FOR MY PERSPECTIVE WHY I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. THIS THIS WAS SO I APPRECIATE THE EDUCATION PATH MATT I APPRECIATE THAT AND I APPRECIATE- THE- OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTS AND TRADE THE BILL'S A WHAT COMES OUT I GET ALL THAT. THE POINT OF MAKING THE COMMENT. IS TO SUGGEST THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE. HAVE THE LANGUAGE VERSES YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO READ A TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT IT IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC FROM MAY FIFTEENTH. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WE MADE THE DISTINCTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE. SENATOR MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE INFORMATION WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS BILL I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AND I CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE THAT- AND I WISH THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION HAD PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION AHEAD OF TIME. BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS STILL A POLICY BILL. THIS IS NOT A TRAILER BILL THIS IS THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENTING POLICY YOUR BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND THERE IS A WAY IF THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE MAJORITY OF THIS BODY DOES NOT WANT THIS TYPE OF FIREARM TO BE- SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE IS A WAY TO DO THAT AND THAT IS BY. DEFINING IT IN STATUTE AS AN ASSAULT WEAPON WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT DONE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO THAT BUT WE'VE NOT YET DONE THAT SO- I GO. I JUST I GO BACK TO MY EARLIER STATEMENT WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A POLICY BILL AND HAS NO BUSINESS THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION HAS NO BUSINESS BEING IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL BUT THANK YOU FOR- FORWARD FOR ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU MINISTRATION GONNA MOVE ON TO AB NINETY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION MR THIS ONE OFTEN. YES AB NINETY FOUR IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION OVERALL BILL THERE EXCERPTED BUILDER NUMBER PROVISIONS I'LL JUST MENTION THREE AT THAT THE FIRST RELATES TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE COVER K. TWELVE BUCKS FOR IN THIS CLARIFIES THE STUDENT CENTER CENTER FINDING PARKING LTS AS WELL AS THE DEFERRALS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH WE ALSO HAVE IN ADDITION TO THE CASE FILES DEFERRALS IN THE BUDGET. THE SECOND PART OF THIS BILL THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT RELATES TO CALIBRATE AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP AND EVEN THOUGH THE BUDGET WAS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE FISCALLY GIVEN THE PANDEMIC- THAT THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE REACHED A PRESERVE ELIGIBILITY AND SUNDAYS FOR CAL GRANTS AND MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP SO. THIS BILL PROVIDES HIM THE DETAILS FOR WHAT IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PROGRAMS ANOTHER ITEM OF NOTE THAT RELATES TO TEACHER TRAINING DAY EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM I'D DISCUSS THE TRIGGER FUNDING BEORE AND BASICALLY THIS EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT DIRECTLY INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. BUT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES PROVIDE AT LEAST FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR TEACHER TRAINING WILL BE RESTORED- BUT THERE MANY OTHER PROVISIONS I ALSO HAVE CHRIS FERGUSON ON THE LINE. WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION FOR MEMBERS. SENATOR Y. CASKEY AN ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN ON THE UC'S SAN FRANCISCO. PARNASSUS HEIGHTS A PLAN I'M WONDERING WHAT IS THE URGENCY THAT THIS BILL THAT WE GIVE THIS. PARTICULAR YOU SEE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT- THE AB. NINE HUNDRED TREATMENT OR OF VALUE- OPTION OF HAVING A TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS TO HAVE THEIR EYES DIR GO THROUGH THE PROPER. AT A COURT PROCESS IN MEN HAVE BEEN DOING ALLOW THE UC REGENTS TO ENTER INTO THE GROUP AND AGREEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION AND LISTED SAY PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT AND IT IT HAS ITS EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX CITIES I DON'T. UNDERSTAND AT SIX YEARS FROM NOW WHY WOULD WE WHAT'S THE NEED TO HAVE THISIN THIS IN THIS HIGHER EDUCATION TRAILER BILL. SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEY ON THIS ISSUE ACTUALLY- I AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ON THIS THE ADMINISTRATION ACTUALLY I DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG POSITION ON THE SPECIFIC ITEM AND IT WAS NOT PART OF OUR NAY REVISIONS. IT WAS SIMPLY INCLUDED IT AS PART OF THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO WAS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WERE REALLY PUSHING THOSE PROFESSIONS. IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE WILL MOVE ON TO. AB ONE HUNDRED GENERAL GOVERNMENT TO MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN. THIS IS THE SECOND GENERAL GOVERNMENT DALE AND ONLY TWO MAJOR ITEMS OF NOTE- FIRST IS THE TRANSFER OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO ADD THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- AND THEN THE SECOND IS RELATED TO THE USE OF PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS THIS NOVEMBER I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON EITHER OF THOSE. QUESTIONS THE FINANCE. QUESTION. THANK YOU SEEN NONE WILL MOVE ON TO AB ONE OH TO CAL SAVER. FINANCE. SORRY WAS NEEDED TO NEXT STILL RELATES TO CAL SAVERS- AND INCLUDES TIãU- CHANGES- BUT GENERALLY TECHNICAL WITH SOME SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT THE FIRST- REGARDS THE ENFORCE MANY CAL SAVERS PROVISIONS AND THIS MOVES AT THOSE ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS ARE KEY RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THE AND I MEAN WITH THE E. D. I. TO THE CAL SAVERS BOARD ALSO WORKING WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD- AND THEN THE SECOND MAJOR ITEM OF NOTE SERVICE THEY ALWAYS CLARIFYING THE OPT IN OPT OUT- REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE CAL STATE FIRST PROGRAM. THE THANK YOU QUESTIONS THIRTY MORE LOT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT- CAL SAVERS- IS NOT A CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT AND I SEE IT IS A STYLE DRIFT FROM WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND PERHAPS NOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HARD CHOICES A CAL SERVERS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED AS A BUDGET REDUCTION MEASURE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE EASY PART OF THIS I KNOW THAT- MY OFFICE AND I'M ASSUMING MANY OFFICES HAVE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH- FOLKS TRYING TO GET THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT TO SO IT IS THIS ANTICIPATION THAT WILL HOPEFULLY STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO THAT THE NEARLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF WORK OR ABLE TO GET THERE YOU AYE A- BENEFITS. SO SENATOR THOSE AREN'T- ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC DETAIL BUT I THINK- YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE WELL KNOWN ISSUES THAT YOU DO DE UM HAS HAD- IN TERMS OF GETTING THOSE BENEFITS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK OUR WORK CERTAINLY VERY AWARE OF THAT SCALING UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ARE THE MINISTRATION AS- ALREADY NOTED THAT THE PERFORMANCE TO THIS POINT. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND WE NEED TO GET BETTER SO WE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT ARE WORKING ON THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. A COLLEAGUE SEEN NONE WILL MOVE ON TO AB ONE OH THREE. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. FINANCE YES ON EIGHTY ONE OF THREE- IT TO SPECIFIC CHANGES- IN THIS TALE- FIRST- RELATES TO TRIGGERING ON CERTAIN BENEFITS RELATED TO A. B. THAT CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ACCETTURO LEGISLATION ON AND THEN THE SECOND- WHEN IT COMES TO YOU ARE YOU AYE PROGRAM SPECIFIC TO KOBE ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE PAYMENTS ARE NOT CHARGED AGAINST THE EMPLOYERS RESERVE A CAL ASSISTANCE THAT YOU SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL SOUNDING BUT IMPORTANT CHANGES- AND I ALSO OF COURSE CLICK ON THE WIND IF ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT EITHER. THE. SENATOR DOLLY. THE VENTURE THE FOUND A BILL LIKE A SUPPORT TODAY THIS IS GREAT. I DID HAVE A QUESTION ON THE ON THE- SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HELPING PARTICIPATE IN- THE SIX HUNDRED PER WEEK I BELIEVE IN. IS FOUR FIFTY FOUR. THE STATE- IF I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF EMPLOYERS TO ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES TO COME BACK TO WORK BUT THEY'RE- MAKING MORE MONEY ON UNEMPLOYMENT WITH THE DUAL- BENEFITS. IF YOU'VE OFFERED YOUR JOB BACK AND THEY DON'T ACCEPT IT AND THEIR REPORTED THEN DO THEY LOSE THOSE BENEFITS. YEAH CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL. I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR BENEFITS BUT DEFINITELY IF SOMEONE IS OFFERED THEIR JOB BACK THEN THEY SHOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO WORK AND THEN- BY THEM BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THAT JOB THEY SHOULD NOT THEY SHOULD NO LONGER BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME- I THINK IT A LOT OF IT IS CONTINGENT UPON THE AGREE ABOUT. HOW THEY WERE RELEASED WITH THEIR- WITH THEIR EMPLOYER IF THEY WERE LATE LATE OFTEN THEY RECEIVED A SEVERANCE PACKAGE- THEN DEFINITELY YOU KNOW THERE'S NO CERTAINTY THAT THEY THEY SHOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO WORK BUT IF THERE WAS SOME AGREEMENT TO BE IF IT WAS A- AND- A MOMENTARILY LOOK LIKE A ENTER I'M WAY OFF WHERE THEY STILL RETAIN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THEIR JOB AND THEN THEY SHOULD BE REPORTING BACK TO THEIR EMPLOYER AT THAT POINT IN TIME. IT WOULD IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION BECAUSE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THROUGH THE- I ALWAYS CALL THE BAIL OUT OR THE IS. IT IS QUITE HIGH AND IF YOU COUPLE THAT WITH THE STATE- THIS LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS A WEEK. AND I KNOW THAT- MANY EMPLOYERS TO. OR TRYING TO GET BACK TO WORK THERE PLEASE DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THE ACTION MAKING MORE MONEY WHEN THEY'RE NOT EMPLOYED. THEN WHEN THEY WOULD BE EMPLOYED SO THAT'S BECAUSE SOME OF THE- CONFLICT- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO REOPEN THEIR BUSINESSES. MISTER THIS ONE I FOUND- IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT AS OF LAST WEEK. THE STATE IS ALREADY PAID. THIRTY BILLION AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. THERE WAS ACCORDING TO A NEW SOURCE FROM KNX AM IS AT. CORRECT. COULD YOU HEAR SENATOR MORLOCK ARE THE AND I WAS HAVING HARD TIMES HE DID EXACTLY WE COULD HEAR AND THAT WE NEED TO CHECK THE EXACT FIGURE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN THAT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT BOB WE'RE TALKING BILLIONS I THINK SEC YEAH THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WHAT I SAID BILLION SO YEAH DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WE BORROWED. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PAY- UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS I'M JUST CURIOUS. IS THAT THE CASE AGAIN. YES SO WE ARE- WE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO DRAW DOWN HONEST FEDERAL SIGNS FOR BORROWING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENTS JUST AS WE WERE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION I SHOULD ADD THAT FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR I DOES NOT REQUIRE INTERESTS TO BE PAID ON THAT BORROWING AT LEAST NOT UNTIL NEXT YEAR AND THE GOVERNOR HAS PETITIONS- OUR PARTNERS IN CONGRESS TO EXTEND THAT DEADLINE POSSIBLE. AND DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH WE BORROWED TODAY. LET ME TURN OVER TO CHRIS KIRKER WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AT HAND TO. LET ME TALK WITH CHRIS. YEAH CHRIS CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE CENTER MORE LIKE THAT. TO BE EXACT I BELIEVE EARLIER THIS WEEK WE HAD ISSUED SINCE MARCH I WANT TO SAY IT WAS AROUND THIRTY SIX BILLION IN BENEFITS. THROUGH THE U. I. PROGRAM AND AS FOR MARLENE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE BECOME FAR AWAY AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S APPROXIMATELY. AROUND. TWO TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS HER. BUT THAT NUMBER FLUCTUATES DAILY BASED ON INCOMING RECEIPTS OF- OF- YOU AYE PAYMENTS FROM EMPLOYERS AND THEN HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING OUT SO IT FLUCTUATES. SO THEN A DO WE HAVE A PAYMENT PLAN WILL. WOOD IT TOOK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA QUITE A LONG TIME- WITH THE GREAT RECESSION TO PAY OFF- THE FEDERAL LOAN WE HAD LIKE A TEN BILLION DOLLAR BALANCE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND SINCE BUSINESSES WERE FORCED TO PAY A HIGHER FUTA TAX EVERY DECEMBER TO PAY IT DOWN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M I'M WONDERING IS THAT GOING TO OCCUR AGAIN. SO WHAT I'LL SAY TO THAT IS THAT WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT- AS YOU KNOW SENATOR MORE LOCK WE'RE SEEING HISTORICALLY. HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT WE ARE ALREADY WELL ABOVE THE HE GOT EMPLOYMENT THAT WE SAW IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE SISTERS STATISTIC THAT IS DIRECTLY DRIVING- THESE REQUESTS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THEN HE- SOME FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. GENERALLY THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS RIGHT NOW IS THAT AS YOU NOTED. BUSINESS IS A PAIN TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM- WOULD HAVE TO PAY. FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF THE LOAN OVER TIME AS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE GREAT RECESSION. AND THE GENERAL FUND- IS OFTEN ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE INTEREST RATES ALTHOUGH AS NECESSARY- THAT EXAM SO WE FOR THE REST OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. HOWEVER WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR WEEKS ACROSS ALL AREAS AND SPOKE FOR BUSINESSES AND FOR THE STATE BUDGET THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THEM THAT. WE HOPE THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED AND- WILL HAPPENS BE ONE OF THOSE OFF BALANCE SHEET. LOU LOANS THAT SOMEHOW FALLS INTO THE PURVIEW OF. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AYE AYE SIR MEMBER GETTING HERE AND HAVING A CALL. IN DECEMBER FROM A BUSINESS OWNER. WHO WAS JUST BESIDE HERSELF BECAUSE SHE JUST GOT HER FORM NINE FORTY FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX. RETURN FROM HER PAYROLL SERVICE WHO. I DO AND FORMER DECEMBER JANUARY THAT- THE STATE STILL OWED MONEY TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO SHE HAD TO PAY A HIGHER RATE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE SAID MY GOODNESS I GOTTA PAY. FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I WASN'T PREPARED TO NOW I CAN'T PAY MY CHRISTMAS BONUSES AND I HANDLE THE BUSINESS OWNER OF A DEAR LADY ON THE PHONE CRYING ACT. SO WHEN ARE WE GOING TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO A MUCH HIGHER. FUTA TAX WHEN- THAT ROLLS AROUND IN DECEMBER JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WHEN THEY'RE READY. YOU KNOW OP BUCKLING AT THE KNEES IF THEY'RE STILL IN BUSINESS. SO GENERALLY IT HAPPENS ON A SPECIFIED TIME LINE ON THAT IT DOESN'T RAPIDLY RISE- IMMEDIATELY RATHER IT SCALES UP OVER TIME SO THERE IS SOME PREDICTABILITY. BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS WHO CAN TALK A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. THANK YOU YEAH- MY COLLEAGUE IS CORRECT THE FOOD ATTACKS ACTUALLY DOESN'T TAKE A FACT ONLY WHEN THERE IS- TWO YEARS THAT THE STATE HAD DIED THE STATE'S YOU WHY. BALANCE IS INSOLVENT AND SO FOR EXAMPLE- AT THE POINT IN WHICH THE- THEY WERE IN SOLVE IT NOW THE AFFECT OF THAT- THEIR TAX MORE INCREASE FOR TWO MORE YEARS SO REALISTICALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT. MAYBE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR UNTIL- IS WHEN THE ACTUAL TAX WILL INCREASE FOR THOSE EMPLOYERS SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND THAT WILL ALL BE BASED ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE STATE IS BORROWING AN- ABSOLUTELY WILL BE. UNEMPLOYMENT IS CATENA RICE THAT WILL BE BORROWED THE MORE- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE EMPLOYERS WILL BE KNOWN- WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS INCREASE- I WOULD ALSO ADD AS WELL IS THAT THIS TRAILER BILL IS PROVIDING SOME LIMITED SUPPORT. FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THAT DAY- THEIR EXPERIENCE RATING IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED AND SO AS A CONDITION OF RECEIPT OF SOME OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDS- THAT. ONE OF THE CONDITIONS WISE IS THE STATE I SHOULD BE HOLDING THOSE- SMALL BUSINESSES HARMLESS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR EXPERIENCE RATING AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS BASICALLY- THEIR EXPERIENCE RATING OR HOW MUCH THEY PAY INTO THE U. I. FUND. IS IN PART BASED UPON HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF AT THEIR BUSINESS. AND BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH COLLUDED AND- HOW HOW THAT WAS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL ESSENTIALLY WHERE EXEMPTING THEM FROM THOSE FROM EXPERIENCING THOSE- AT THE IMPACTS OF THEIR. EXPERIENCE RATING DUE TO THE LAYOFFS. MISTER COOK THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW ABOUT TWO YEARS THAT CAN BE REAL HELPFUL IN DEALING WITH CONSTITUENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THE- THE DETAILS ON THE RATES FOR ISSUE I. JUST ONE LAST QUICK QUESTION OF THE THIRTY SIX BILLION HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS STATE FUNDS. I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNT I KNOW THE LORD SHARE I BELIEVE IT WAS ESTIMATED AROUND THIRTY ONE MILLION WAS IN PARK. TO BE LARGELY PAID BY THE FAT SO. THE BOOK OF THE DOLLARS THAT HAVE GONE OUT THE DOOR IT HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS. SO WE PAID OUT THIRTY SIX BILLION THE FEDS PAID THIRTY ONE MILLION SO THAT THERE THAT STILL YOU MEAN THIRTY ONE BILLION. OKAY GREAT GREAT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MANAGER YOU'RE VERY WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THIRD THIRD ARE ALSO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I KNOW THAT THIS. THIS IS ABOUT OF THE ACTUAL BENEFITS THEMSELVES BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT- BRING UP THE ISSUE OF HOW. WHAT IS STILL LACKEY IN IT AT THE E. D. D. AS FAR AS GETTING THESE DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR AND INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE IS NOTHING THAT- TAKES UP MORE TIME FOR OUR STAFF. THEN HE DID A CALLS ABOUT AN EMAILS ABOUT EDT. EVERY WEEK HUNDREDS SEVERAL HUNDRED ALMOST DAILY UP CLOSE TO A HUNDRED CALLS AND EMAILS WE HAD A TOWN HALL- THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IT BUT WE HAD SIXTEEN HUNDRED WOULD SAID THEY HAD AN ISSUE- THEY NEEDED HELP- WE WERE TOLD THAT HUNDREDS WERE MORE WE'RE GOING TO BE. HIRED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS STILL ON EVERY LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION THERE'S ENORMOUS ANGER AND MY STAFF HAS TO TAKE OUR STUFF OR YOU KNOW OUR STATE GOVERNMENT STAFF THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE BRUNT OF ENORMOUS ANGER ENORMOUS FRUSTRATION AND YOU KNOW IT TO DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN YOUR- YOU HAVE. NO POWER TO AFFECT- HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEM HOW TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM IS- IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND I REALLY IT YEAR IT'S BEYOND WHAT WE WERE GOING TO HIRE HUNDREDS MORE WE STILL CAN GET IN THE STILL CAN'T MAKE CONTACT THEY STILL CAN'T- GET THEIR CASES ADDRESS AND THEY CAN GET A CALL BACK SO. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT MONEY IS THERE BUT AND I'M SURE I KNOW BILLIONS ARE GETTING OUT. BUT ENORMOUS ENORMOUS ANGER AND FRUSTRATION THAT OUR STAFF OF THE DISTRICT STAFF IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY. INCIDENT DRAWS A LIMITED DATA DID- HAVING HOSTED A TOWN HALL ALSO WHERE THE EDT STAFF WHEN WE PUSH BACK IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WHAT'S THE RECOURSE IF THEY HAVEN'T HEARD BACK IN MONTHS AND THEIR ANSWER WAS WILL CALL YOUR SENATORS OFFICE. SO EDT STAFFERS CITY PEOPLE ARE TELLING THE PUBLIC WILL CALL YOUR LEGISLATOR- SO DID ON THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ANY RESPONSE TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM FIND IT SENATOR DOLLY. IS REAL QUICK I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD% BECAUSE I KNOW THE EVERY SINGLE OFFICES HAD. REALLY THOUSANDS OF CALLS AND ONE OF THE ISSUES WE FOUND IN OUR THIS MAYBE WILL HELP SOME OF THE OTHER OFFICES. WHEN THE FRIDGE ONLYFILED. THEY WENT ONLINE IN THE FILE AND THERE WAS NO ABILITY FOR THEM TO SAY THIS WAS COVE IT. RELATED SO THEY PUT IN THAT THING THE CHECK THE BOX THAT SAYS. I'M UNEMPLOYED AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY DIDN'T NOTICE. IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR WORK YOU'RE DENIED ANY THEY GOT. PUSHED INTO A PILE. BECAUSE THEY REALLY EREN'T LOOKING FOR WORK THEY KNEW THAT AS SOON AS CO BUT- WAS WAS OVER OR- THE TIME RAN OUT WE WOULD GO BACK TO WORK. SO THEY REALLY WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT PUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN A CATEGORY AND THEY WAITED. A LOT OF THEM. TWO OR THREE WEEKS A MONTH AND DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE AND STORY CONTACT THEIR OFFICES AND- WE REALIZED THAT THEY NEEDED TO RE APPLY BECAUSE- THEY WERE. THEY THEIR KIDS SYSTEM DID NOT ALLOW THEM. THERE WASN'T A SPOT FOR THEM TO SAY HEY THIS IS C BUT IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A- BOXES SAID CODE RELATED. WITH A KNOWN RIGHT THEN THAT THEY JUST NEED TO GET RIGHT ON THE ROLE WE GET A PUMP THE MONEY OUT SO I JUST WANT TO. SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY STAFF FIGURED THAT OUT AFTER. SOME TIME OF DEALING WITH MANY-MANY MANY CASES IN A LOT OF. VERY FRUSTRATED CONSTITUENTS SO JUST WANNA SHARE THAT INFORMATION. WE DISCOVERED THAT AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO TELL ANYONE ELSE. BUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LIKE TO RESPOND AT ALL OR- SHALL I KEEP IT MOVING. I'LL JUST SAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND- THE AND FRUSTRATION OUT THERE AND WHILE IT CALIFORNIA'S NOT UNIQUE APP THAT IS NO JUSTIFICATION SO EVERYONE HERE IS WORKING AS FAST AS WE CAN- TO FIX THESE ISSUES. WE APPRECIATE BACK OF PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND DESPERATE. MOVE ON TO AB ONE- FINE THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM. YEAH I'M A ONE EIGHTY ONE OH FIVE THIS MAKES SOME CHANGES- REGARDING BE TAX TREATMENT FOR- SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS SO OFTEN YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE WHEN TO SORT FARMS THAT THEY'RE CALLED- AND THESE- ENERGY SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT TIED TO A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES SO FOR THOSE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS IT WOULD MAKE A COUPLE CHANGES NUMBER ONE CLASSIFYING IT AS PERSONAL PROPERTY AND NUMBER TWO- IF THESE AS SOLAR ENERGY FARMS OUR SYSTEMS ARE CONSTRUCTED. AND OR INSTALLED PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- AND THERE IS NO TAXATION ON THAT PROPERTY- A CLASS FOR THAT PERSONAL PROPERTY EXCEPT THERE'S A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP ON AND THEN- MOST IMPORTANT THAT THIS WOULD ONLY GOING TO A FACT IF THESE SCHOOL COMMITTEES FIRST AT AT AND A BALLOT MEASURE THIS FALL IS ENACTED- OTHERWISE THIS WOULD BE REPEALED. AS OFFICIALS THERE NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. THROUGH A LOT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THERE IS A REAL PROPERTY TAX AND THERE IS PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX AND MR THIS ONE UP ON YOU'RE AYING THAT IF SOMEONE PUTS A SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM ON THEIR COMMERCIAL PROPERTY THAT WILL NOT BE ADDED TO THEIR- ASSESSED VALUE THEIR BASIS FOR REAL PROPERTY TAXES. BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO REPORTED AS PERSONAL PROPERTY ON FORM FIVE SEVEN ONE L. IS THAT WHAT I HEARD SO LET ME SAY AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CHANGE CHAMBER WHEN YOU CAN ELABORATE DICTATE SICKLY IF IT IS NOT HARD AT A HOME OR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY THAT IS NOT PART OF THE REAL PROPERTY TAX- AND AJ- WILL SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS THAT YOU MENTIONED REGARDING THE TAXATION OF PERSONAL. PROPERTY THANK YOU ST CHAMBER ARM FINANCE. ALSO CENTERED MORE LIKE- AS YOU AS YOU SAID THAT THIS WOULD BE. ON THIS PROPERTY WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED AS PERSONAL PROPERTY BUT IT WOULD BE AS PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE STILL BE EXEMPT FROM THE PROPERTY TAX. AS LONG AS IT'S CONSTRUCTED PRIOR TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND UNTIL IT IS- IT IT CHANGES OWNERSHIP. SO THE ENTERED. IT'LL BE SHOWN AS PERSONAL PROPERTY BODY WILL BE EXEMPT FROM. PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX TO THE BE MAYBE A SPECIAL LINE FOR IT ON THE FORM PART SEVEN ONE NOW. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MEASURE VERY WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR OUT SO. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE- WHO GETS THE BENEFIT IS THIS A THESE BUSINESSES THAT GET THE BENEFIT IS IT. UP ON INDIVIDUALTHAT GETS THE- EXEMPTION FROM PAYING TAXES WHO ACTUALLY GETS THE BENEFIT OF THE EXEMPTION OF THE TAXES. SO SENATOR AWESOME TO SUPPLY SPECIFICALLY TO THE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE WHEN THEY'RE NOT TIED TO A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SO THE OWNER OR ANYONE WITH AN INTEREST IN THAT PROPERTY THEY WILL BE THE ONES WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE BILL. THE QUESTIONS. JUST TO THE OFFENDER MARLA MISTER MANAGER JUST. THIS WOULD ONLY BE OF. EFFECTIVE IF THE BALLOT MEASURE FOR SPLIT ROLE IS APPROVED IN NOVEMBER. THAT'S CORRECT YES THANK YOU HARPER THIS IS ALL BRAND NEW TO ME SO WHO SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD CLARIFY IT IS A TRAILER BILL- SO TRAILER BILLS TO GO INTO EFFECT. IF THIS WHAT ROLE MEASURE IS NOT- IS NOT ENACTED IN NOVEMBER THEN THE PROVISIONAL BE REPEALED AS OF THE FIRST YEAR NEXT YEAR AND I'M SURE THIS WAS UP ON THE WEB ON MAY FIFTEENTH AND I DIDN'T READ THIS FUNNY THERE'S AT THE CASE MANAGER. WITH ME NOT SURE OF ABOUT I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ONE SO THIS IS THIS IS A DIFFERENT MEASURE FROM BE DONE VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURES THAT WE WERE TO SETTLE YOUR MIND AT EASE. YEAH I DID DID YOU COULD JUST COME ABOUT LATER. AND NOW LEGISLATIVE. SELECT TWO HOURS AGO MAYBE. TO SALIVA BY MOST THIS TIME IS THAT. I'LL BE BACK TO YOU ON THAT. THE DALAI A YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS NO I JUST. IT JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET IT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS CAN I COME AS A SURPRISE SO. THANK YOU MANAGER AND IN THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE CONFIDENT KNOWING THAT THANKS TO THEIR VOTE THAT NOTHING COULD BE VOTED ON WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BEING IN PRINT. SO SENATOR DOLLY. THE MANAGER THIS IS A- IT'S REALLY CONCERNING TO ME- THINK SENATOR ALSO BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT. SO FIRST OF ALL I'M SURE MOST YOU KNOW ON THIS FLOOR THAT. WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN GIVING TAX FREE SOUL OR- FOR HOMES A IN THE COUNTIES WITH THAT WOULD WE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THOSE TAXES SO IT'S NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH ALL FORMS OF RENEWABLES SO SOLAR GET TO AN EXEMPTION. SO YOU'RE COUNTY DOESN'T RECEIVE THE TAX THAT YOU FIND. A LOT OF THINGS WITHIN YOUR COUNTY YOUR YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY- ROADS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT COUNTIES PROVIDE THIS WOULD BE A TAX EITHER SO I AM I'M MY QUESTION TO THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES IS WHY IS THIS BILL IN HERE AND WHAT. I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE GONNA IT WE HAVE A SPLIT ROLE COMING-UP. BUT DID A WORD OF WARNING A BUDGET. DEFICIT AND WE TALK ABOUT REVENUES THIS IS ONE PLACE WHERE I BELIEVE AS A REPUBLICAN. WE SHOULD LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND MAKE THEM PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S PUT IN. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A WIN PERSON OR YOUR- OR YOUR OTHER TYPES OF RENEWABLES THEY DON'T ENJOY THIS SAME. A BENEFIT AND SO IT'S REALLY NOT LEVEL AND IT'S PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE RENEWABLES SOMETHING I'VE BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH FOR A LONG TIME IF IT'S ABOUT SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE THE- IN MY OPINION THE SOLAR LOBBY IS JUST OWN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IT'S OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE- SOME OF THE ABSURDITIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS PLACE. WITH THE INCENTIVES THAT THEY GET OVER OTHER TYPES OF RENEWABLE SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THIS IS IN THIS BUDGET IT IS A LAST MINUTE DEAL- NO DOUBT ABOUT IT- IN IN IN ITS RETROACTIVE ONLY IF. ABOUT INITIATIVE GETS PASSED SO THIS IS REALLY CONCERNING IN THE PROCESS OF HOW WE LEGISLATURE HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU THE LOCALS ARE LOSING OUT ON THIS AND THE AND THE AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS IN THE RENEWABLE BUSINESS. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT STILL LIKE AN ANSWER FROM DHAHRAN THEM ONLINE ASK WHY THIS IS IN THE AIR AND WHAT'S DRIVING THIS FINANCE. A YES CENTER GOLLY I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF POINTS- I THINK FIRST OF ALL- IS THE FACT AS HE MENTIONS THAT THAT THIS WOULDN'T GO INTO A FACT UNLESS THERE'S SCHOOLS AND RELEASED FIRST INITIATIVE. IS ENACTED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER AND WHILE I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT TAKEN AT SPECIFIC POSITION ON THAT BALLOT MEASURE AS OF YET- TO ADDRESS YOUR POINT ABOUT THE FISCAL PRESSURES AND IF THAT MEASURE ERE TO BE ENACTED- AND THIS PROVISION WORDS TO TAKE A FACT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS ON THERE WOULD BE A NET. POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOCAL REVENUES AT FOR SCHOOLS ANOTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO YOUR POINT ABOUT NAY SO I'M TAKING REVENUE AWAY IN A BUDGET DEFICIT I'M WHILE THERE MIGHT THERE WOULD BE A REVENUE DECLINE FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IT WOULD BE IN THE CONTEXT OF A BROADER STACKS OF REVENUE INCREASES AND I THINK THE BROADER POINT- I WILL MAKE IS. AS YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROVISIONS THAT RELATED TO ENERGY- THAT THE MIST VERSION OF LEGISLATURE OFTEN DISCUSSED TOGETHER- BUT SOLAR AND RENEWABLE ENERGY MORE BROADLY- IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS PART AT. MEETING STATES CLIMATE GOALS ARE AND WE KNOW THAT AS YOU TODAY AS THE YEARS GO BY THOSE GOALS BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT- SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY CAN RESULT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. TO ALL TAKE THAT AS- THEIR GOOD AT GETTING LOBBY IN. AND THEIR HEDGING THEIR BETS EVEN IF THE PROPER. SPUR ROLE PASS. THIS IS A- THIS IS JUST. I CAN'T BELIEVE. WE'RE DOING THIS IN A TIME WHERE WE NEED REVENUES AND WE NEED TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO I APPRECIATE- THE LONG ANSWER TO A SHORT QUESTION. THAT THEY'RE JUST AHEAD OF THE GAME ON GETTING THEIR POSITION. SO THAT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO GET A BREAK. OVERALL IF THERE'S A SPLIT ROLE. SENATOR MORLOCK ANOTHER CLARIFICATION FROM MISTER VISWANATHA AND CENTER DOLLAR BRINGS UP A GREAT POINT WE ARE NOW GIVING A TAX BREAK BUT IT COMES AT THE COST OF COUNTY. GOVERNMENT ARE ARE WE THEN GOING TO REIMBURSE THE COUNTY FOR THE LOST REVENUE I MEAN IT IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO CUT DEALS WITH IT DOESN'T AFFECT SACRAMENTO BUT IT IF IT AFFECTS SOMEONE ELSE I I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S EVEN ETHICAL BUT- I I'M JUST CURIOUS IT. WHAT HAPPENS TO HOUSES THAT EXISTS OUT OF THE COUNTY MAKE UP THE LOST REVENUE FINANCE YES I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE POINTS FIRST- AND I MAY NOT HAVE CLARIFIED THIS BEFORE BUT THIS IS A RE ENACTMENT OF CURRENT LAW SO THESE PROVISIONS AND THE PURPOSES BEHIND THEM ARE ALREADY A CURRENT LAW AND SO- IF HE INITIATIVES AND ACTED THIS WOULD SIMPLY REFLECT AT. NEW A SNAP THAT ALREADY AND THEN THE SECOND POINT THIS BILL DOES NOT CERTAINLY DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE A BACK SALES BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE BROADER CONTEXT OF SCHOOLS IN THE FIRST FOUR TO PASS- ESTIMATED REVENUE RANGES ANYWHERE STATE TEN OR TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS SO- THE ANY REVENUE GAINS FROM THE LIST WOULD MORE THAN OFFSET BY MANY MULTIPLES HI ANY EXCHANGE. AS A RESULT THIS BILL. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER QUESTION. THREE NONE CLIPS PROCEED TO AB ONE NINETEEN- INVOLVING STATE EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE BARGAINING UNITS AND THERE ARE SEVERAL LISTED THERE IN THE AGENDA. FINANCE YES ON THE ESTATE BARGAINING BILL AS YOU MENTION MADAM CHAIR- THIS- MAKES CHANGES ALLOWING FOR THE RATIFICATION OF AMMO USED IN ATTENDANCE FOR SEVERAL BARGAINING UNITS I'LL JUST LIST THEM BARGAINING UNIT ONE THREE FOUR SIX NINE ELEVEN. PARTICULAR THE PROVISIONS OF THE TRAILER BILL. LABEL RIGHT TO SIXTY. AS LONG AS THERE ARE SAVINGS IN THESE AGREEMENT- IN THESE AGREEMENTS THAT REFLECT- WHAT IS THE SAVINGS ASSUMES AS PART OF THE BUDGET AT THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED AN ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY. SO I KNOW THERE MAY BE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE SPECIFICS OF THESE HEARINGS I'M SORRY LEASE AGREEMENTS- SO I'M GOING TO. ALSO HAVE MERRY HALTER MADE MY COLLEAGUE A DEAL LAST AND WILL BOTH BE ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS OR THE SAVINGS THAT WERE REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET ACT. QUESTIONS MEMBERS THIRTY PAN. I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH ACTUALLY MY QUESTION ISN'T ABOUT ANY ONE THE SPECIFIC AGREEMENTS AND APPRECIATE- THAT YOU THE AGENT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WITH THOSE BARGAINING UNITS. I IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IS PROVISION IN THIS TRAILER BILL THAT BASICALLY HAS THE LEGISLATURE SIGN OFF ON ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED YET PRIOR TO THE- END OF THE YEAR ARE. CAN YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT IS- PROVISION FOR US TO APPROVE AGREEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN INTO GHOST COME. WHEN WHICH NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. SENATOR PENN DEAD SO IT YES AS YOU KNOW THAT FISCAL YEAR BEGINS ON JULY FIRST FOR NEXT YEAR SO A LOT OF AT LEAST FOR THESE AGREEMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAVINGS ARE REFLECTED. FOR ANY CHANGES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GO INTO EFFECT ON JULY ONE. AND ENSURE THAT WE GET THE SAVINGS FOR THAT WHOLE YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE EXACT MECHANISM LET ME TURN IT OVER TO. AND SPEAKS THAT. ALL RIGHT APARTMENT FINANCE GUYS SO AND WITH THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS TRAILER ABOUT VERY FACING IS I'M CIRCUS. I THIS IS ALL AS AROUND PROCESS FOR AGREEMENT AND THAT ARE STILL TO BE SHE- SO IT'S GOING TO AS AND WAS MAKING ONLINE A LONG STREAMLINED PROCESS SPECIFICALLY I'M THEY MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTROL SECTION REFINANCING AND BUDGET FOR IN TIME IN THE BUDGET- JUNIOR LANGUAGE AND THIS PROCESS IS ONLY IN PLACE THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH SO NEXT USAIN. ROXBURY ON JULY ONE NEXT OF NEXT WEDNESDAY I'M WILL REVERT BACK TO THE NORMAL RATIFICATION. I JUST LIKE HER I AM RIGHT RIGHT INTO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON. OKAY WELL I WOULD JUST NINETY EIGHT THEN. SHE THE END SO I AM GUESS SOME OF TO OF PUBLIC AND- IN RETURN COMMITTEE. FOR THE STATE SENATE. AND IN THE PAST I IN USED ACTUALLY HEARD. BY THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO FULLY THAT THE MO USE AND THEN WE SIR SHIFTED TO A PROCESS BY WHICH- WE PUT THEM TO USE THROUGH THE BUDGET NOW BILLY THAT ALLOWED THE- NUMBER YOU TO ACTUALLY TAKE A FAX WITH THE NEW BUDGET YEAR INSTEAD OF WAITING TILL. JANUARY FIRST BUT DID SORT OF SHORT CIRCUITED OF THE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. AND NOW IN THIS CASE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE HELP FREE APPROVING AGREEMENTS THAT HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN SETTLED ON NOW I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND YOU HAVE SAID IN YOUR TESTIMONY- THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES. BUT I DID WANT TO ASK ABOUT IT AND SAY THAT I CERTAINLY HOPE AND I KNOW REALIZE THAT THE PROVISION IT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL IS VERY TIME LIMITED- THAT THIS DOES NOT BECOME A HABIT. THIS IS NOT A PRECEDENCE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPECTED- IN FACT A RIGHTS I STILL THINK EMMA YOU SHOULD HAVE A GREATER VETTING THAN THEY DAY IN RECENT. OFFICE HAVE BEEN IN PLACE DEBTS I THINK THAT IS A ROLE THE PURSE COMMITTEE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SHOULD ACTUALLY A PLAY- BUT- CERTAINLY I DO NOT THINK IT'S A- GOOD IDEA FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE PRE APPROVING- HELLO USE- YOU KNOW EXCEPT IN EXTREMELY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES SO. YOU HAVE SAID THIS IS EXTREMELY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE WILL CERTAINLY WE CAN LOOK AROUND AND SAY YES IT PROBABLY IS THIS IS A ONE IN A HUNDRED YEAR PANDEMIC- BUT CERTAINLY I HOPE THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF PROPOSAL WE EXPECT TO SEE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ANYTIME IN THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THIS THANK YOU. SENATE MORE LAP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF EVERY TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. FOR NEGOTIATING FOR PARTICIPATING- IT IS IT IS NICE TO SEE THAT THE EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING A 10% CUT IN PAY. DURING THIS MOST DIFFICULT TIME BUT- THIS AGREEMENT ALSO SAYS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUSPEND. THE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS FOR OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS WHICH IS 4% SO. THEY'RE TAKING A TRADE OFF IN THE REALLY ACTUALLY JUST TAKING A 6% PAY CUT SO. BAD TO ADVERTISE THAT WERE. ASKING HIM TO MAKE A 10% CUT IS ACTUALLY AN EXAGGERATION. SO I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO MISTER THIS ONE OF FUND. THAT YOU CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD NOT TO CONTINUE WITH HOLDING 4% FROM THE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE. THAT THE STATE ITSELF PLEASE. AT 4% INTO THE- HAVE TRUST AND THEREFORE YOU HAVE SOME ROOM TO GIVE RAISES WITHOUT GIVING A REYES NECESSARILY- BUT- YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE TO INCUR MORE IF I COULD TAX FOR OTHER EMPLOYEES ARE IMPACTED. BUT YOU THEN AS A STATE WE AS A STATE WILL BE PAYING THAT. ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO PAY DOWN THE- HOPE HAVE TRUST BALANCE OF SOME EIGHTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. AND THEN YOU RE NEGOTIATE THE ENTIRE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN. YOU INTEGRATED WITH MEDICARE YOU. HAVE MORE REALISTIC. A COLA PERCENTAGES YOU- WHO HAVE SOME EARLY RETIREMENT DISINCENTIVES WE DID THIS. IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND WE REDUCED OUR UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY 71% WITH JUST A FEW MINOR BARGAINING UNITS AGREED TO. AND YOU WOULD REMOVE FROM THE BALLOT SHEET OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU'D REMOVE SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFUNDED LIABILITIES. AND THAT WOULD GET US OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE RACE WITH THE ILLINOIS IN NEW JERSEY SO HERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO MAKE A CHANGE TO A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM THAT KEEPS GROWING. BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT. WITHHOLD THE- CAB CONTRIBUTION THIS YEAR TO SUSPEND THAT YOU'RE ADDING ANOTHER ONE POINT TWO BILLION TO OUR LIABILITIES. AND WE'RE ALREADY ADDING ANOTHER THREE BILLION BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN BACK ARE PREPAYMENT OF CALPERS SO. WE'RE REALLY ADDING. SOME SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDENS TO THE NEXT YEAR TWO THREE FOUR- FOR THOSE THAT FOLLOW AND WE REALLY HAVE TO HOPE FOR SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION. AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN BE TO RECORD. BUT WE'VE GOT TO START PLANNING AHEAD SO I. I OFFER THAT TO YOU MISTER RESPOND UPON WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO FIX SOMETHING THAT SYSTEMIC WITH BROKEN. AND IF YOU NEED ANY HELP PROMOTE WE GET AN ORANGE COUNTY I'M HAPPY TO HELP YOU OUT THANK YOU MISS. MR BUT IT'S ONE OF ON IT THANK YOU MANAGER. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME THE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CITY NONE. COLLEAGUES LEADS A GO TO OF THE GOLDEN ROD THE ADDITIONAL BILL THAT WAS ADDED AS AN ADDENDUM TO THE AGENDA SENATE BILL. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. MR THIS ONE OFTEN. THE LAST- BILL ON THE AGENDA AT AGE AND AS YOU SAID- MADAM CHAIR SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THAT THIS IS- WHILE NOT TYPICALLY- TRAILER BILL UNDER THE DEFINITION OF PROPOSITION TWENTY FIVE- IT IS- WE BELIEVE AN IMPORTANT PART OF IT BUDGET PACKAGE AND SO I'LL JUST SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THE KEY ELEMENTS ARE CHRIS COOK IS ON THE LINE- FOR ANY DETAILS AS WELL AND WE'RE ACT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT- THE- KEY PROVISIONS OF THE STALE GREW OUT OF BOTH THE TWENTY NIGHTS. IN BUDGET AX EXPANSION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM SIX WEEKS STATE WEEKS AS WELL AS THAT TASK FORCE WAS FORMED THAT CAME UP WITH ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE KEY A MEASURE OR THE THRUST OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IS THE FACT THAT EVEN WHEN KATE AND WE WAIVE IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT SUFFICIENT WORKER PROTECTIONS MANY EMPLOYEES DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ENABLES TWELVE WEEKS OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE FOR ALL WORKERS ARE CARD MOST OF THEIR EMPLOYERS SIZE. EXPANDS THE TYPES OF FAMILIAL RELATIONSHIPS CONVERTS THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND IT ALSO ALLOWS- EVEN IF YOU PERRANCE AT THE SAME EMPLOYER THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPLIT THE TWELVE WEEKS AMONG EACH THAT MAD THEY WOULD EACH GET ACCESS TO THE FULL. TWELVE YEAH THAT'S- SO WE THIS IS PART OF THE OVER. MOOD THAT WE WHICH IS NOT FOR JOB WHICH I. FROM TO ACTUALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LEAD THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED. QUESTION FOR MEMBERS TO THE TO ROTH FOLLOWED BY SENATOR MILK IT ARRIVES. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR FIRST TO. COUPLE STATEMENTS OR COMMENTS AND THEN- SOME QUESTIONS YOU KNOW. WHEN WE SET THE EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS POLICY FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES WE GENERALLY ESTABLISH COVERAGE THRESHOLDS TO ENSURE THAT THE- EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS CAN SUSTAIN THE POLICY IN IN THE CASE OF LEAVE POLICIES THAT THE- EMPLOYERS OPERATION OR THE ENTERPRISE IS ABLE TO HANDLE THE LOSS OF AN EMPLOYEE EASE SERVICES AS WE PROVIDE. A IN THIS CASE WELL DESERVED LEAVE BENEFITS. AND IN IN SETTING THESE EMPLOYEE COVERAGE THRESHOLD FOR LEAVE ENTITLEMENT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE ANTICIPATED FREQUENCY OF THE LEAVE THAT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED. AND SO- FOR THOSE REASONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS I KNOW FINANCE KNOWS. WE'VE HAD A PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE PROGRAM THAT FOR FORTY YEARS SINCE AROUND. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SEVENTY NINE HAS SET A COVERAGE THRESHOLD. OF FIVE EMPLOYEES FIVE FULL TIME OR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. PREGNANCY EVENTS OCCURRING WITH SOME FREQUENCY IN THE WORKPLACE BUT NOT QUITE AS FREQUENT AS AN EMPLOYEES OWN ILLNESS OF THE ILLNESS OF EMPLOYEES FAMILY. AND SO FOR THAT REASON BACK IN ABOUT NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHEN WE- SET UP THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT TO PROVIDE LEAVE TO AN EMPLOYEE ON ACCOUNT OF THE EMPLOYEES OWN SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION OR THE SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION OF EMPLOYEES. OF PARENT SPOUSE OR CHILD. WE SET UP AN EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD SO THAT'S FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS WE'VE HAD THAT WE SET UP A COVERAGE FULLY COVERED THRESHOLD OF FIFTY EMPLOYEES. LEAST UNTIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN FOR THE BONDING PIECE BONDING WITH A NEWLY ADOPTED OR NEWLY BORN CHILD THAT THRESHOLD WAS REDUCED. TO TWENTY EMPLOYEES. SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THOSE POLICIES AT A BRAT BEEN AROUND FROM TAUGHT FOR TWENTY SEVEN OR FORTY YEARS WITH COVERAGE THRESHOLDS THAT HAVE BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED AN EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY ANY EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS WE'RE TAKING ALL OF THOSE THRESHOLDS DOWN TO ONE EMPLOYEE IS THAT CORRECT. MR HIS WHEN OFTEN. YES THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE TAKE THAT ANY EMPLOYEE- IN THE STATE- GIVEN THAT THE PURPOSE OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE TO PROVIDE TIME FOR BONDING- OR RELATED PURPOSES FOR FAMILY WE- BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. LIST IS CLEAR ONE THING UP YOU KEEP USING THE TERM PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND WE'LL GET TO THE TASK FORCE REPORT IN A MINUTE. BUT PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT SET FORTH IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE OF CALIFORNIANS SECTION THIRTY THREE HUNDRED SEC. IT'S A IT'S A WAGE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM IT'S ADMINISTERED BY THE EDT SIMILAR TO STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND IT HAS PROVIDED THE SIX WEEKS AND WILL PROVIDE THE EIGHT WEEKS THAT YOU. MENTIONED EARLIER BUT THAT'S TERRACE MANAL CORRECT TALKING I APOLOGIZE SENATOR I MEANT JOB REJECTED WEEDS OUT I APOLOGIZE. FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION. SO GOING TO MAKE AND YOU ANSWERED IT SO GIVEN THAT EXPLANATION THE THRESHOLDS ARE GOING DOWN TO ONE EMPLOYEE. SO AS AN EMPLOYER FOR HAVE ONE EMPLOYEE AND SHE HAPPENS TO BE A FEMALE. AND SHE IS BECOMES PREGNANT. AND IT'S A PROBLEM PREGNANCY THEN THAT EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO UP TO FOUR MONTHS SIXTEEN WEEKS OF PROTECTED PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE CORRECT. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO CHRIS CUT CHECK CONFIRMED THAT EXACT SITUATION THEY DESCRIBED. YES SENATE ROTH THE YOU'RE CORRECT IT IF THERE IS A THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A DISABILITY LEAVE IF THERE WAS- ISSUES WITH THE PREGNANCY AS WELL. BUT FOUR MONTHS OF NOT PAY BUT FOUR MONTHS OF JOB PROTECTED PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE CORRECT CORRECT. AND THEN AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE WHEN THE EMPLOYEE MY ONE EMPLOYEE IS ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK THE EMPLOYEE IF THE EMPLOYEE SO CHOOSES. UNDER THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS THAT COULD BE ALSO BE ENTITLED TO. TWELVE THREE MONTHS OR TWELVE WEEKS OF. BINDING LEAVE CORRECT. CLEARLY YES YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT. FOR TWELVE WEEKS THREE MONTHS OF BONDING LEAVE WITH THE NEWLY BORN CHILD CORRECT. WELL SAVE YOU TIME THE ANSWER IS YES. SO DURING THIS TWELVE MONTH PERIOD OF TIME MY ONE EMPLOYEE WOULD BE OFF WORK FOR. SEVEN MONTHS CORRECT. AND DURING THIS LEAVE BOTH THE PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE AND THE- BONDING LEAVE THE EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO TAKE AND I WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY. FOR MY ONE EMPLOYEE. ANY AND ALL ACCRUED VACATION AND SICK LEAVE CORRECT. A CRACKED. AND THE EMPLOYEE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THAT I WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE TO THE EXTENT THAT I. HAD A GROUP HEALTH POLICY IN PLACE FOR MYSELF AND MY EMPLOYEE I WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE. THE PREMIUMS AND CONTINUE THE GROUP HEALTH COVERAGE FOR THAT EMPLOYEE RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. MEL MY RESEARCH REFLECTS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A ONE POINT SIX MILLION EMPLOYERS. TEN ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION OF THOSE EMPLOYERS HAVE FIVE OR FEWER. EMPLOYEES. SO I GUESS MY NEXT QUESTION IS WHY WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE. TO TAKE THESE WELL ESTABLISHED COVERAGE TRACHSEL'S THAT WERE SET OBVIOUSLY FOR A REASON AT THE TIME THAT THE VERY STATUTES WERE ENACTED AND DRAW ALL OF THOSE DOWN TO ONE EMPLOYEE. YEAH. WE BELIEVE ARM. WE BELIEVE PROVIDING THESE THE COVERAGE IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS- AND THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PAYING INTO IT SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO THESE PROTECTIONS WELL I'M SURE THAT'S THE CASE BUT I MEAN WAS THERE SOME OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. SOME SERIES OF DECISION POINTS THAT YOU CONSIDERED AN- DEALT WITH AN USED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT YOU MADE OBVIOUSLY WE'D LIKE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EVERYONE. RIGHT BUT I WILL SAY SENATOR ROBB THAT AT THIS HAS BEEN- DISCUSSION THAT- THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HAVING- OVER ANY MONTHS INCLUDING BOTH IN THE TASK FORCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION SO I KNOW THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON THE OUTCOME- BUT IT WAS NOT A ROSS STORE CARE WAS DECISION WELL THIS GOES TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS I MEAN YOU WHEN. YOU TAKE A POLICY ISSUE THAT IS UNTETHERED TO A LINE ITEM IN THE BUDGET. AND YOU BRING IT INTO A BUDGET COMMITTEE YOU MUST NOT TO BE TOO DISAPPOINTED IF WE DEAL WITH THIS AS A POLICY ISSUE AND ASK YOU POLICY BASED QUESTIONS SO LET ME FOLLOW WITH ANOTHER ONE. IN COMING UP WITH THIS PROPOSAL. DID THE ADMINISTRATION THE ADMINISTRATION. DO A STUDY OR ANALYSIS ON THE IMPACT OF THIS RATHER SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE. SINCE IT'S GOING TO HIT ONE POINT SIX MILLION EMPLOYERS TO ONE EXTENT OR ANOTHER. DID THE ADMINISTRATION DO A STUDY OR ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THIS POLICY CHANGE ON EMPLOYERS AND IN PARTICULAR SMALL EMPLOYERS. THE TASK FORCE CERTAINLY CONSIDERED AT ALL OF THOSE CONSIDERATIONS- I'D HAVE TO CHECK WITH THEM UNLESS CHRIS KNOWS THAT BUT WE HAVE TO CHECK WHETHER THEY DID THAT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS YOU'RE REFERRING TO BUT CERTAINLY THAT WAS PART OF THE EVALUATION WILL BE IS THIS THE TASK FORCE THE TASK FORCE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PAID LEAVE. TASK FORCE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YES ALTHOUGH THAT'S JUST ONE VEHICLE- THIS IS DAN- UNDER DELIBERATION AND- YOU KNOW WE HAD THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED IN JANUARY- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF THOUGHT HAS GONE INTO. WILLOWS ILLUSTRATES ANOTHER PROBLEM I ASK FOR ANY REPORTS THAT FORM THE BASIS FOR THIS POLICY DETERMINATION AND WHAT I WAS PROVIDED. WAS A I WAS PROVIDED WITH ESSENTIALLY. AFIVE PAGE TYPED REPORT NOT SIGNED. AND I WAS TOLD THIS WAS THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS USED TO COME UP WITH THE POLICY CHANGE. AND IT'S ENTITLED PAID FAMILY LEAVE IN AGE YOU HAVE ALREADY NOTED IN RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION PAID FAMILY LEAVE IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CODE NOT THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTIONS THAT WE'RE AMENDING HERE SO. IS THERE ANOTHER REPORT THAT I WAS NOT PROVIDED WITH IN RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST. I'LL DEFER TO CHRIS ON THAT- IT'S WE KNOW OF ANY OTHER. YEAH SO CENTER OUT THE DOCUMENT THAT YOU HAVE I OR A SCENE YOU HAVE IT WAS A SUMMARY OF THE WORK THAT WAS PUT FORWARD BY THE TASK FORCE. WHICH WHICH REPRESENTED- MANY STAKEHOLDERS MEMBERS I STAFF FROM THE LEGISLATURE FINANCING DEPARTMENTS- AND CONSIDERATION DID GO INTO THE IMPACTS ON SMALL BUSINESSES. AND AS A MATTER OF FACT A SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESS- GROUPS WERE- ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THE TASK THAT THE MONTHLY TASK FORCE MEETING. WELL I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE- I WAS LOOKING AT THE SIGNATORIES OF ALL THEY'RE NOT SIGNATURES BUT THERE'S SIGNATURE BLOCKS. AND OF COURSE THE LEAD ONE IS THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND MY QUESTION WAS WHETHER THERE WAS SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN THIS GROUP FRANKLY I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. AND I LOOKED AT THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AND I'M LOOKING AT THE MEMBERSHIP. THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS. GENENTECH UNION BANK. LIVE I GUESS THEY HAVE EMPLOYEES NOW COMCAST. AT AND T. PGA. I'M WELLS FARGO AND ON AND ON AND THEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LIST THEM YOU LOOK AT THE MEMBER COMPANIES I HAVE I'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME IDENTIFYING ANY OF THE COMPANIES IN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL THAT I WOULD CONSIDER SMALL EMPLOYERS SOMEONE WITH FIVE EMPLOYEES OR TEN EMPLOYEES OR EVEN FIFTEEN AND THEN I LOOKED AT THE- OTHER. PARTICIPANTS IN THIS TEST WORSE OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION OUR FRIENDS OVER THERE AND- ON AND ON AND I GET DOWN TO THIS THING CALLED THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. AND I DID A LITTLE HOMEWORK AND WHAT I FOUND WAS IT'S A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE BUT- DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY. EMPLOYER MEMBERS. THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY HAS. FINANCE WE DO NOT WAIT I HAVE WILL IN FACT IN THE YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN CONSIDER NEWSPAPERS AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES ANYMORE THE NEWSPAPER REPORTS INDICATE SORT OF REFLECTED THERE ARE NO EMPLOYER MEMBERS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IT IS IN FACT A FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE. OF FUNDED BY FOUNDATIONS AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS TASK FORCE REPORT HAD. VERY LITTLE IF ANY. SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATION SO IN ADDITION TO IT FOCUSING ON THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHICH IS NOT THE SORT OF. SECTIONS THAT WERE AMENDING. I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT DOESN'T REFLECT THAT IT HAD ANY SMALL BUSINESS REPRESENTATION PROVIDING INPUT AS TO THESE RATHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. WAS THERE ANY OTHER STUDY THAT WAS DONE. DID THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE ANY OTHER CONTACT WITH CALIFORNIA'S SMALL BUSINESS CONTENTION TO DETERMINE HOW THESE CHANGES WOULD IMPACT THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. YES I'M I BELIEVE THERE WAS A REPORT OR A STUDY DONE BY STANFORD- ON ON THIS IMPACT DO YOU THINK SINCE YOU'RE ASKING US TO CHANGE POLICY DO YOU THINK. THAT HAVING THAT STUDY TO REVIEW IN ADVANCE AND DISCUSS WITH YOU WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND 4 DEGREES OF INCREASE. I THINK IF THE WE THEY WERE THERE ARE POOR WE CAN PROVIDE THE REPORT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING AGAIN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT DURING THE TIME OF THE TASK FORCE THERE WERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM- THE LEAD STAFF THAT WERE ALSO IN ATTENDANCE- AND- THEY WERE- THEY HAD ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE TASK FORCE WILL UNFORTUNATELY THEY OF WHOEVER THEY ARE WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THIS BUILDING THEY DON'T TALK TO ME. SO IS IT YOUR POSITION THAT SMALL BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS THIS CHANGE. I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL SMALL BUSINESS BUT THE ONES THAT WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE TASK FORCE YES. WHAT THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES WHICH CLAIMS I'M NOT A MEMBER. CLAIMS TO REPRESENT FIFTEEN THOUSAND. SMALL BUSINESS. OPERATORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS FILED A LETTER OF OPPOSITION DID YOU CONSULT WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS. I CAN'T CONFIRM OR DENY IF WE IF WE DID. SENATOR ROBB WE'VE GOT SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS COULD YOU JUST ABOUT INTERNET MORE YOU'LL BE ASKING I HAVE SEVERAL MORE MANAGER THAT I DIDN'T ASK TO PUT THIS POLICY BILL IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE SENATOR ROBB. I AM AWARE OF THAT SIR AND I'M SIMPLY ASKINGYOU HOW MANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS AND I HAVE AND IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT FINANCED FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE CAN ACTUALLY ANSWER MADAM CHAIR WHAT DO WE DO IF THEY DON'T PUT SOMEBODY AT THE MIKE WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE CENTER WALL GO AHEAD WITH YOUR QUESTION THE NUMBER TO MOVE ON WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS FATAL HEAD. SO IN LOOKING AT YOUR REPORT- MISSED HIS WHEN OFTEN. ONE OF THE THINGS IT SAYS AS PART OF THE RECORD RECOMMENDATION IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THESE CHANGES. IS TO CREATE A PILOT GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL EMPLOYERS WITH INCREASED LABOR. AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEAVE TIME. WAS A GRANT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED. IN FACT IT SAYS THE TIMING OF EXPANDED JOB PROTECTION AND SMALL BUSINESS MITIGATION MUST BE CONGRUENT. I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION. RE TASK FORCE REPORTS WHICH YOU ALL ARE RELYING ON TO SUPPORT THESE CHANGES SAYS. IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT YOU SHOULD CREATE A PILOT GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP SMALL EMPLOYERS WITH INCREASED LABOR AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEAVE TIME. IT FURTHER STATES THE TIMING OF EXPANDED JOB PROTECTION AND SMALL BUSINESS MITIGATION MUST BE CONGRUENT. WAS A PILOT GRANT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED. NO NO PILOT PROGRAM. SENATOR ROBB I WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET CURRENTLY SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE I DID NOTE THAT SO IF THERE'S A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET PROVIDED IT'S PASSED AND SIGNED THAT'S LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR PER EMPLOYER NOT ONE DOLLAR PER EMPLOYEE DO YOU FIND THAT. SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE MITIGATION AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGES THAT YOU PROPOSE. NOW BUT WE VIEW THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS AS A PILOT PROGRAM AND IT WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR ALL IT WOULD BE JUST TO- PROVIDE SOME RELIEF IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE ALSO PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE I WOULD KNOW THAT THE- THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL HAS A LOT OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT CAN HELP BUSINESSES. BY WAY OF PROVIDING. TRAINING AND OTHER TYPES OF-SERVICE LIKE- SHORT TERM SERVICES FIRM HOLE AND SMALL EMPLOYERS. THE HARDSHIPS WITH- OF VACANCIES OR POTENTIALLY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ONLY. DID THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ASSESS AND QUANTIFY THE COST TO THE SMALL BUSINESS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE QUANTITY OF FUNDING TO BE PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET TO. MITIGATE THESE COSTS. NO THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS WAS WAS WAS NOT MEANT TO COVER ALL OF THEM IT WAS MERELY JUST A PILOT PROGRAM- TO PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF WITHIN WHY DIDN'T WE DO A SIMPLE PILOT PROGRAM WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THESE CHANGES INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CHANGES APPLY STATEWIDE TO ALL EMPLOYERS. AGAIN I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK WE VIEW THAT PROTECTING THOUGH THE JOB FOR ALL THE WORKERS REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE IS CRITICAL FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ALL WHO ARE ALSO PAYING IN. TO THESE ARE FOR THE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE ALSO PAIN AND FOR THESE. LEADS OR TRY TO MOVE THIS LONG BEFORE I GET THE HOOK BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE REPRESENTING BUSINESS. AND OTHERS FOR. QUITE SOME TIME GIVEN MY AGE. THAT MOST BUSINESS VERTICALLY SMALL BUSINESS TYPICALLY HAVE A KEY EMPLOYEE OR MAYBE TO THAT ARE. SIMPLY ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING THE BUSINESS RUNNING IN THE TRAINS RUNNING ON TIME WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S ALSO AND- THAT IS OFTEN THE CASE SENATOR ROSS BUT AT THE ADMINISTRATION NOTABLE WAYS THAT JOB PROJECTED LEAVES- IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR ALL WORKERS SO WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A TRADE OFF. WITH THE LET ME ASK A QUESTION SO FOR TWENTY. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS SINCE THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY TWENTY SEVEN OR TWENTY EIGHT SINCE TE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT WAS FIRST ADOPTED. THE ACTORS HAD A PROVISION IN IT THE- SAYS THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE IS A SALARIED EMPLOYEE ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAID IN OTHER WORDS THE KEY EMPLOYEE. THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE ACT DESCRIBES IT. BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AS CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE EMPLOYER FACES SUBSTANTIAL AND GRIEVOUS ECONOMIC INJURY TO THE OPERATIONS THAT IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE EMPLOYER CAN ASK THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS ON FAMILY LEAVE TO RETURN TO WORK. TO HELP SAVE THE EMPLOYER. YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT CORRECT. CORRECT OKAY THEN HAVING BEEN AWARE OF THAT WHY IN THIS PARTICULAR SET OF AMENDMENTS DID YOU DID THE ADMINISTRATION ELECT TO DELETE THAT PROVISION. WHAT WAS THE DECISION MAKING CALCULUS THEIR- THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT JOB PROTECTED WE'VE REALLY DOES NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALL WORKERS AND AFTER THE STUDY THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TRADE OFFS BUT IT REALLY DOES NEED TO BE AVAILABLE WHETHER YOU'RE A HIGH SALARIED EMPLOYEE WHETHER YOU'RE ON LOW SALARIED EMPLOYEE. WHETHER YOU WORK AT IT TAKES FOR WHETHER YOU WORK AT A SMALL FIRM AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IS DRIVING THIS BILL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS- MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FOR. AT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE YEARS- BUT WHEN DEEP MISTRUST LOOKS AT THERE'S- A LOT OF THE VALUATION BUT IT'S ALSO A VALUES ISSUE THAT I EVEN AN EMPLOYEE IN THAT POSITION SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO JOB PROTECTED WILL YOU MISUNDERSTAND YOU MISUNDERSTAND THE PROVISION THE EMPLOYEE HAS A FOR HAS ACCESS TO THE LEAVE AND IS ENTITLED TO TAKE THE LEAVE. BUT THE EMPLOYER IF THE EMPLOYER IS ABLE TO ESTABLISH SUBSTANTIAL GRIEVOUS ECONOMIC INJURY. THE EMPLOYER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CALL THE EMPLOYEE BACK THE EMPLOYEE HAS A DECISION AT THAT POINT TO OTHERS STAY ON LEAVE OR COME BACK AND THEN AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT WHERE THE EMPLOYEE RISK REQUEST RETURN TO WORK. SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE EMPLOYER GETS TO DECIDE IF THE EMPLOYERS ACTION IN IN FILLING THE POSITION OF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUSTIFIED OR NOT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECT. YES ALTHOUGH I DO BELIEVE THAT WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS A WEAKER FORM OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING DID YOU DO ANY STUDY OF THE WORKPLACE IN CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION WAS CAUSING ANY. PARTICULAR SET OF PROBLEMS AND IN TERMS OF HOW OFTEN IT WAS USED AND- HOW OFTEN THE SUBSTANTIAL GRIEVOUS ECONOMIC INJURY PROVISION WAS TRIGGERED. I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO CRASH ON WHETHER AT ANYTHING ON THAT SPECIFIC PROVISION. I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT PROVISION. WILL LET ME MOVE ON. FOR ABOUT THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME THERE WAS ANOTHER PROVISION IN THE CALIFORNIA RIGHT FAMILY RIGHTS ACT WITH THE PROTECTED LEAVE FOR SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION OR LEAVE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICE HEALTH CONDITION FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT SAID IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO BONDING LEAVE THAT IF TWO EMPLOYEES WERE PARENTS AND THEY WORK FOR THE SAME EMPLOYER. THEY COULD TAKE THE LEAVE BUT THE LEAVE WAS LIMITED TO THE PERIOD OF TIME FOR ONE EMPLOYEE WHICH IS TWELVE WEEKS AS OPPOSED TO. A TOTAL OF TWENTY FOUR. YOU ELECTED TO REMOVE THAT PROVISION FROM THESE AMENDMENTS WHAT WAS THE CALCULUS BEHIND THAT DECISION. THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T FEEL THAT- I SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WORK AT THE SAME COMPANY AS THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER. DID YOU AGAIN DID YOU DO ANY STUDY OF THE- LAWYER. BASS CAL TO. DETERMINE OR NOT THAT PROVISION AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED WAS CAUSING ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY EITHER FOR. THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED OR THE EMPLOYERS INVOLVED. I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT. WELL THEN LET ME. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT I THINK SORT OF ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM. I AM THE OWNER OF A COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED STUFF. I HAVE A FULL BOOK OF CLIENTS BY HER BY HER TO. THE EMPLOYEES BOTH HIGHLY HIGHLY SKILLED HIGHLY COMPENSATED COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY SPECIALISTS ALL THREE OF US SPEND EVERY WORK DAY FIVE OR SIX DAYS. A WEEK IN THE FEEL THAT OUR CLIENTS OPERATIONS THEIR OFFICES DOING SOFTWARE JUDGMENTS SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER WORK- ETCETERA. WELL ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF IS A FEMALE SHE GETS PREGNANT SHE'S OUT FOR FOUR MONTHS SHE'LL LECTURE BINDING LEAVE FOURTH THREE MONTHS. AGO AND IS OUT SHE COMES BACK FOR A WEEK MY MAY EMPLOYEE HIS SIS. BECOME VERY ILL WELL MYELOMA. HI HE NEEDS THREE MY UNDER THE FAIR RIGHT SECTOR AMENDED TO CARE FOR HER BOTH. ALL PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE LEASE NO QUESTION THERE. SO I NOW HAVE FIVE NOW HAVE TEN MONTHS OF A TWELVE MONTH WORK HERE. WITH ONE THIRD OF MY WORK FORCE ONE LEAVE. OUT ITS COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IS HIGHLY SKILLED MAYBE IN THE COVERT NINETEEN ENVIRONMENT I WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BUT I HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME SECURING TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES TO FILL THAT JOB BECAUSE I CAN'T BE THERE TRAINING THEM I HAVE A FULL BOOK OF CLIENTS MYSELF THE SERVICE. I CAN'T GO TO A REGULAR EMPLOYMENT AGENCY TO HIRE A REGULAR EMPLOYEE BECAUSE NO ONE'S GOING TO COME TO WORK FOR. NINETY DAYS. AND I CAN'T CONTRACT FOR THAT WORK WITH ANOTHER COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS ISSUE WITH AB FIVE. SO MAYBE THOSE SITUATIONS ARE SOLVABLE BUT LET'S ASSUME THERE THEY ARE WHAT DO I DO MR HIS WHEN ASSN. SO WHAT I CAN SAY ABOUT THAT- THIS SITUATION THAT YOU DESCRIBED IS THAT I UNDERSTAND IN THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THAT THAT WOULD RAISE OBSTACLES- FOR THAT EMPLOYER- BUT REDUCING AN EMPLOYEE'S JOB PROTECTED WE WOULD ALSO A BRIDGE ABOUT A YEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES. SO THERE IS A TRADE OFFS I RIGHT WE BELIEVE THE- IN THIS CASE PROVIDING THAT JOHN PROJECT WE EVEN AND THAT THE WORKER HAS THAT PROTECTION. IS THE RIGHT MOVE EVEN NASH AND THE HIGH SITUATION. THAT YOU DID JUST. IT COULD LEAD TO SOME OF THE OPS FOR THE PEOPLE AND- WELL. IT'S AVE THAT THEIR WHOLE BY OF P. ON THE FOR FLOOR. WHO HAVE NEVER EVER BEEN EMPLOYER. IN THE PRIVATE. IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S TO SAY THING ANY OTHER COMMON TO MAKE BEFORE I IT BACK MY CHIU. IS YELLOW WE MAY AND IT SO OF US TO OFFER SINCE. TO THE GOV AND THE INVENTOR ON THIS MAY. AND WE WERE TOLD A SENSE. THAT IT WAS A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT PROPOSITION. NOW I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIRTY NIELSEN. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE HOUSE THAT. BECAUSE EVERYBODY SOUTH OF WHERE I COME FROM. I TAKE THIS THIS PIECE OF THAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY. THAT I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE THAT. THIS BILL IS. SHOULD IS A POLICY BILL QUITE FRANKLY IT NEEDED TO BE VETTED OUT. IN A POLICY COMMITTEE. AND WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES TODAY OVER THE DISCUSSION THAT. THAT THIS WAS DONE BY THE THREE PARTY AGREEMENT. QUITE FRANKLY THAT'S TO ME. ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH THIS LEGISLATURE'S THAT THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER BY THREE PARTIES. THE GOVERNOR AND THE IN THE LEGISLATOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE PRO TâM AND THE SPEAKER. AND I REPRESENT A MILLION PEOPLE ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU. AND THIS HIT THIS IS PERSONAL. I AM THAT IN PLAYER. I HAVE ONE FULL TIME EMPLOYEE USED UP FOR BUT I'M DOWN TO ONE. YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE OF PART TIME EMPLOYEES THERE ARE MY SONS. WHO ARE MAKING MONEY DURING THE SUMMER SO THEY CAN ATTEND SCHOOL. I DON'T HAVE AN HR DEPARTMENT THE H. R. DEPARTMENT IS ASSEMBLY WOMAN MAKING DOLLY. AND IT'S CRAZY TO KNOW THE LAWS THAT ARE PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE THAT I HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. WITH OUR SMALL LITTLE BUSINESS OUR FAMILY FARM IN OUR TRUCKING BUSINESS. WE HAVE TO HIRE AND A PERSON TO DO OUR PAYROLL FOR THAT ONE PERSON IN AND THE PART TIME HELP THAT WE HAVE SO WE CAN COMPLY. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING OUT OF COMPLIANCE TO WHERE WE WOULD EITHER HARM OUR EMPLOYEES OR BE SUED BY SOMEBODY WHO. THANKS FOR BAD PEOPLE BECAUSE WE SUPPLY A JOB IN A PRODUCT THE CALIFORNIANS NEED. THIS BILL. A LET ME JUST TELL YOU I HAVE A TRUCK DRIVER. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS UNDER SOME OF THE OTHER LEGISLATION WAS PASSED YEAR. THEY HAVE A SPECIAL LICENSE THEY'RE ENROLLED IN A DRUG PROGRAM. THEY ARE DEAD MONITORED BY HOURS OF SERVICE. THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY MANY LAWS THE A TRUCK DRIVER AS AN EMPLOYEE HAS TO ABIDE BY. AND WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA QUITE FRANKLY CROSS THE NATION. SO FOR ME TO LOSE THAT EMPLOYEE. WOOD SHOP MY BUSINESS DOWN AND I WANT TO SHARE YOU KNOW THE GOOD SENATOR OUT TO QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO YOU GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR YOU LEAVE THE STATE. THERE ARE A ONE POINT WHERE. ARE MY STATISTICS SO ONE POINT ONE MILLION. BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FEWER FIVE EMPLOYEES. AND WE ARE WE DON'T HAVE A LOBBY I IN THE LOBBY FOR THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE SO I RAN FOR THIS JOB WAS TO. SHARE THE STRUGGLES THAT SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA FACE AND- FOR THE LIFE OF ME. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO. MAY HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE AND WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF OUR WORKERS. MY WORKERS MAKE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. MY TRUCK DRIVER MAKES TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT THIRTY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR TO THE BUSINESS. MY POINT IS THAT THIS BILL SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH A COMMITTEE. SEVERAL THESE BILLS ARE THESE POLICY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THROUGH POLICIES COMMITTEE. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE A TIME SUNDAY WHEN THESE BUSINESSES AS I SPOKE UNDER THE ORIGINAL BUDGET. IT'S A RESPECT. YOU CANNOT HAVE A GOVERNMENT. AGENCY OF ANY SORT OR GOVERNMENT WORKER OF ANY KIND OR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OR ANYTHING INTEL A PRIVATE BUSINESS PAYS A TAX OR THE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THEM. PAY A TAX FIRST. AND PUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE OUR PRIORITIES WRONG HERE OUR PRIORITY SHOULD BE WE NEED A BALANCE WE A BALANCE OF YES GOOD EMPLOYEES AND THERE ARE BACK THERE ARE BAD ACTORS. ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OTHER PEOPLE. BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY EMPLOYEES. I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED I WANT THEM TO BE PART OF OUR FAMILY. IT IS HARD TO FIND GOOD PEOPLE TO WORK. THE CARE AND I'M COMPETING WITH GOVERNMENT JOBS THAT PAY GREAT AND HAVE GREAT RETIREMENTS THAT I CAN'T BE WITH AND ALSO COMPETING WITH BUSINESSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. SO I TO SAY TO YOU THIS BILL NEEDED TO BE PUT INTO A POLICY STATEMENT. I COMMEND. MY COLLEAGUE FOR ASKING SOME VERY TOUGH QUESTIONS THEY CAN'T ANSWER BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET IT OUT BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD AN EMPLOYEE. AND I FEEL SORRY FOR THE- THE FOLKS THAT WORK FOR DEPARTMENT FIGHTING TO HAVE TO DEFEND THE GOVERNOR'S MISGUIDED POLICY RIGHT HERE I FEEL I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU CAN ADD TO THE QUESTIONS. BECAUSE THERE MISGUIDED AND THIS IS JUST A SHAM PUT UP IN THE LAST FEW. BUT THIS PROCESS. SO I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO ANSWER THE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH. STUFF THAT YOU CAN ANSWER. THE PROBLEM HERE IS. IS THAT WE NEED TO. WORK WITH BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM KEEP EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS BE ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. SO WE CAN HAVE A THRIVING ECONOMY SO WE CAN GIVE THE SERVICES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. THANK YOU MADAM. I'VE SAID. CHAIR PUTTING UP WITH ME AND SEE ME BACK HERE AND I KNOW BEEN A LONG DAY. WHICH BEEN VERY PATIENT I APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR LABEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO STAND UP I THINK BETTER ON MY FEET. SOME INTERESTING THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD. I ALWAYS ENJOY HEARING MEN DEBATE WOMEN HAVING BABIES AND TO MY SENATOR- FROM RIVERSIDE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MAY NOT HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH SMALL BUSINESS BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDBIRTH. AND I APPRECIATE THE TOUGH QUESTIONS BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THE THINGS THAT WE VOTE ON THIS FLOOR OUR STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES AND RIGHT NOW IN SOCIETY WE VALUE MONEY WE VALUE STATUS WE VALUE STUFF. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE VALUE PEOPLE IF WE VALUED HEALTH AND WE VALUE COMMUNITY AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IN THE EXAMPLES OF IN USE WE TALK ABOUT A WOMAN A WOMAN WHO HAS A DIFFICULT PREGNANCY. I WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WERE MY HUSBAND I'D IS. DORA FOR. AND IT HAPPENED. THE. TOMORROW I DON'T RECOGNIZE POINT OF OR I'M GONNA ASSN LEYVA HER TESTED AND THEN I'M GOING TO GO TO MORE BERKELEY THANK YOU SO LABOR YOU CAN CAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I PAUL SO MORAL FILLED I'M ATTACK SOME I'M JUST OUT THINGS WERE SAID I'M NOT A ANYONE BUT I WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO DID HAVE A DIFFICULT PREGNANCY WHEN MY HUSBAND I DECIDED TO HAVE A BABY I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHO COULD HAVE THE BABY SO I'M THE ONE WHO GOT PREGNANT. AND I END UP BEING PREGNANT WITH TWINS WHICH WAS AN AMAZING BLESSING BUT IT ALSO MEANT THAT I HAD SOME CALL IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE BUT I DID HAVE COMPLICATIONS I HAD TO GO OFF WORK EARLY I WORK FOR A BIG EMPLOYER SO WASN'T A PROBLEM BUT WHAT WE DO FOR OUR WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK FOR A SMALL EMPLOYER SHE WE JUST TELL THEM HEY WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T GO TO WORK FOR SMALL EMPLOYER BECAUSE WHEN YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO QUIT. I THINK WE CAN FIND A WAY I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS AN EASY WAY TO SAY NO BUT CAN WE FIND A WAY TO SAY YES WE ALSO OWN A SMALL BUSINESS WE'VE OWNED A SMALL BUSINESS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THE GOOD SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE AND I HAD THIS CONVERSATION AT THE AIRPORT ON MONDAY AND I SAID MY HUSBAND HAD AN ISSUE WITH HIS BY ONE OF HIS ARTISTS AND HE HAD A GALL BLADDER PROBLEM HE HAD TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF WHO'S GONNA BE OUT OF WORK FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS. MY HUSBAND TO FIND TEMP TO WORK AS HIS SO DID THAT SO WE CAN DO THESE THINGS AND I'VE SEEN SMALL BUSINESSES DO MORE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES THE BIG BUSINESSES SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF HOW TO IT'S A MATTER WILL TOO AND I ALSO HEARD THAT THIS IS MISGUIDED AND A SHAM BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN WORKING ON. THIS BEFORE I EVER CAME TO THE SENATE. A FAMILY EXCUSE ME. PROTECTED HAS WITH THAT THE WIND CAUCUS BEEN WORKING ON FOR. AND I THAT THIS JUST ABOUT PREGNANCY LEAVE BOB BID YOUR OR YOUR CHILD OR YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR FATHER WAS ILL AND YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WE'RE NOT ASKING YOUR EMPLOYER TO PAY YOU TO DO THAT WE'RE JUST SAYING HEY I'D LIKE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PERSON I LOVE. CAN YOU HOLD MY JOB FOR TWELVE WEEKS OR RICHARD CASE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WITH SOMEONE SORRY THE CENTER FROM RIVERSIDE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ON PRESIDENT HAS A DIFFICULT LEAVE BUT WHAT WE VALUE LET'S VALUE PEOPLE ITS VALUE HUMANS WE CAN DO THIS WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT WITH SMALL BUSINESSES LET'S VALUE EACH OTHER LET'S VALUE WOMEN LET'S VALUE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES LET'S MAKE THIS WORK WE CAN DO THIS IT'S NOT A LACK OF HOW TO IT'S A LACK OF WILL TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR ROSS WHICH REALLY ABOUT MENTIONING I MAKE WE GET FOR HIS TO WITH REGARD TO EMPLOY DEVELOPMENT THE ISSUES AND- DURING THIS WALK DOWN I WORK EVERY DAY I WENT TO THE OFFICER DAY AND TOP IS CALL. FOR ME WHERE THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WERE EXPLAINED TO ME. HOW THEIR CASH WAS RUNNING OUT. HI THERE GOES YOUR BUSINESS HOW THEY'RE GONNA LOSE OUR HOME AND THEN TELL ME THERE'S YEARS WHEN THEY DO. AND EVERY SOME CALLS WHERE I WANTED JUST. CARRILLO INTO A BALL AND CRY AND ANOTHER. THE SLIDE DOWN AS BEEN PRETTY TOUGH AND SO NOW HAVE THE- PARTICULAR BILL AND I HAVE A LETTER. WITH BUSINESSES ARE. AN ASSOCIATE THAT ARE. TO THIS BILL. THAT IS A MILE LONG. WE'RE IN A RECESSION. AND WE'RE ASKING BUSINESSES. TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT- RIGHT NOW FOR ME IT IT APPEARS AS IF MADAM CHAIR WERE TONE DEAF. IT APPEARS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS JUST. NOT PRE SHADING WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. MANAGER I WOULD I WOULD REQUEST WE DEFER THIS PARTICULAR BILL UNTIL STABILIZATION IN THIS ECONOMY HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. AND THIS LOOK AT IT WHEN THINGS ARE A LITTLE BETTER. BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S IS THE WRONG MESSAGE THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. GAINES QUESTION YOU LIKE TO BOTH A MINUTE TO MOVE ON REGISTER. THANK VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR NOT FOR SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WON'T I WILL REPEAT IN. THAT'S CENTER BUT I JUST TO SAY THAT THIS THIS PARTICULAR. I GOT MORE CALL FROM. THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DAY. THE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE EDT CALLS. REALLY THE I WHAT I WANNA SAY IS I THAT I HAVE. DISAGREEMENT WITH THE ADMIN. ON THE NEED FOR PROTECTED FAMILY LEAVE AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE- AND THE NEED AND THE NECESSITY FOR. ALL OF US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF FAMILY MEMBERS THAT DESPERATELY NEED IF. EITHER TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES- OR OTHER PEOPLE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS PARTICULAR. BILL IS THAT IT HAS NO FLEXIBILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER THE EMPLOYER CAN'T NEGOTIATE THE EMPLOYER- IS HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF FACING- A- AT AT CAUSE OF ACTION THROUGH A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. ON THE LEAVE DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THE FEDERAL LEAVE THAT AS WAS ARTICULATED BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SO- PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THAT BECAUSE- THERE WAS NO NEGOTIATION AND- IT WAS ATTEMPTED- AND REJECTED IT'S THE SAME LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. THE PAST MONTH I GUESS- IT REALLY AREN'T BECAUSE VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE GIVES ABSOLUTELY NO FLEXIBILITY TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING AT THE AT THIS TIME BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. THAT I SUPPORT. I SUPPORT. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES IT'S JUST YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THE SMALL BUSINESSES ONE POINT ONE MILLION WHO HAVE UNDER FIVE EMPLOYEES. SENATOR PAN THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR NO THIS IS A- CHALLENGING ISSUE AND I THINK CERTAINLY FROM THE DEBATE. AND CERTAINLY I AND VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO THE GOVERNOR'S POSITION- AND CERTAINLY IN MY PROFESSION I SEE- THE CHALLENGES FAMILIES FACE- AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BONDING I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR- DEPARTMENT FINANCES THAT'S ALRIGHT ABSOLUTELY. SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT- WHEN YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND I CAN YOU KNOW FROM SOME THE PREVIOUS PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED AND I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT- NO I FAMILY WE ON THE SMALL BUSINESS BUSINESS OF UNDER FIVE PEOPLE. IN WHICH EACH EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY HAS A UNIQUE FUNCTION FACT SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY HAVE LICENSES. SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE ONE EMPLOYEE DO ANOTHER EMPLOYEES JOB. THE LAW WOULDN'T PERMIT IT. ANYWAY SO WHEN YOU LOSE AN EMPLOYEE WE CAN'T JUST SIMPLY SHIFT SOMEONE AROUND- BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR FINANCE FIRST OF ALL IT IS THAT. KNOWING THAT. WE HAVE SEEMS TO BE SOME ISSUES THAT ARE UNRESOLVED OR UNEXAMINED. IS AND I REALIZE YOU KNOW WE HAVE FINANCE NOT THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF HERE. IS THERE- SOME WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF. THE GOVERNOR THE MINISTRATION TO TRY TO RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. THAT WOULD STRONGLY AFFECTS SMALL BUSINESSES. IN A WAY THAT COULD STILL TRY TO FIND A WAY TO AFFORD. EMPLOYEES LEAVE WITHOUT ESSENTIALLY- POTENTIALLY RUINING THE BUSINESS ITSELF. A SENATOR PAN THIS IS THE LATEST ONE OFF AND ON YOUR QUESTION THAT I WANT TO CLARIFY IN OUR GENERAL ORIENTATION POSITION ON THIS THERE ARE CERTAINLY DISAGREEMENTS- BETWEEN- THE MINISTRATION NOW AND SOME OF THAT SENATORS OUT WHICH WHICH HAVE BEEN VOICED BUT I WOULDN'T AGREE WITH YOUR CHARACTERIZATION THAT- THESE POLICIES HAVE BEEN UNEXAMINED I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT I DID SEE THE POLICY IS AN EXAMINATION SOME OF THE BACKGROUND OKAY WELL THAT'S IT THAT'S IT THAT'S RIGHT SERA. ASSN QUESTION THAT APPEARED LIKE THERE HAS NOT BEEN RESEARCHER VETTING DONE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY AFFECT CONSIDERATION POLICY UNLESS YOU. WISH TO PROVIDE THOSE ANSWERS NOW. SO THIS IS BEEN A YEAR LONG EFFORT AT IT NOW OF THESE IS. I KNOW SOMETHING. WERE AROUND VERY SPECIFIC ONCE ANALYSES WE HAVE FINANCE I DON'T HAVE DOES RIGHT IN FRONT OF US SOME OF THEM IS. MAY HAVE BEEN DONE IN ANOTHER FOR MAYBE NOT IN THESE FORM OF THE- STATE BUT I DO TO CLEAR. AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T A PERSON OUT THERE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION JUST AUTUMN ONE. AND STUCK IN A BILL BECAUSE IT BEEN THE OPPOSITE OF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. THAT GOES INTO THIS I THE FUNDING DISAGREEMENT HERE IS THAT ACTUALLY A AND IT'S KIND OF LATE SO I THINK I'M JUST. YOU JUST SAY IS THE- OR TO MINISTRATION AND REALLY YOU'RE NOT TO GO HIMSELF. OPEN HAVING FOR. COM TO TRY TO MITIGATE OF THE ISSUE. THAT WERE. BY WORK AND- ABOUT THE- SO WE'RE WE'RE ABSOLUTELY OPEN SAID CONTAINING THE CONVERSATIONS ON THESE ISSUES WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC THAT IS EXPOSING FAULT LINES FOR WORKERS. ALL ACROSS THE ECONOMY HAS AND HAS DEMONSTRATE INDEED THE IMPORTANCE OF WEAK AND WE'VE EVEN SEEN. SO RESIGNED ANY YES OR NO. SO YEAH I GUESS YES. OKAY YES WE'RE OPEN FOR THEIR COURAGE AND SEE HERE. BUT WE WHAT WE DO BUT THAT THOSE ARE NONE OF COURSE YOU BELIEVE IN THE BILL WELL ASSUME THEY SINCE WE BILL FOR IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE BILL ON NOT A- OF. WILL TAKE THE YES ALRIGHT SINCE YOU SEE YES THIS QUESTION I HAVE IS JUST THE BECAUSE. FIRED LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. SO WE HAVE TO DO RESEARCH ON THAT SPECIFIC SCENARIO I KNOW YOU DESCRIBED IF THE BUSINESS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WITH SO YOU SEE YOU DON'T KNOW WITH A BUSINESSES UNABLE TO SUSTAIN ITS OPERATIONS. RIGHT NAY EVEN FILE FORMALLY FOR BANKRUPTCY OR DECIDE JUST CHOOSE THE CLOTHES RIGHT THE **** SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. I'M GONNA BASICALLY CLOSED DOWN ACTION OFF SELL OUT THE ASSETS CLOSE DOWN. YOU KNOW BEFORE THAT LEAVE TIME IS UP. DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS WHAT WITH THEIR OBLIGATION WOULD BE TO THE EMPLOYEE WHO TECHNICALLY IS FIRST OF JOB PROTECTED LEAVE BUT THERE'S NO JOB AT THE END OF THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NO BUSINESS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE WHAT THE LEGAL OBLIGATION IS FOR THAT BUSINESS. LET ME CLARIFY CENTER PAN AT LEAST THERE IS NO BUSINESS TO RETURN TO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESS OWNER HAS AN OBLIGATION TO KEEP THE BUSINESS OKAY AND- WHEN THEY WERE OTHERWISE GOING TO- DOCTOR OTHER REASONS JUST A HIGHER THAT EMPLOYEE BUT- IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT SPECIFIC WHETHER IT'S SEVERANCE. WHETHER OKAY CONGRESSIONAL IT'S ALL THESE COULD BE TIED- UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE UNDER PRE EXISTING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY STATE LAW FOR THE EMPLOYERS I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. OKAY I PROPHETICAL SCENARIO AND SO I HVE ALL THE FACTS. OKAY SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO NEED PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND- IN TERMS OF THEIR PLANNING BUT- YOU KNOW. I GUESS THE- SO FRANKLY I WOULD SAY IS THAT FIRST OF ALL. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT- IDEALLY WE SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY JOB PROTECTED LEAVE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE PAID LEAVE. FOR EVERYONE. BUT I ALSO WOULD SAY IS THAT- BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT OUR VALUES AND- OUR BUDGET IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR VALUES. IS THAT WE SHOULD BE BUDGETING FOR ENOUGH MONEY NOT JUST A MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN THEY HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO NEEDS TO BEYOND. TWELVE WEEKS SEVEN MONTHS OF LEAVE. SO THAT THAT SMALL BUSINESS IS STILL AROUND. AT THE END OF THAT LEAVE BECAUSE OF THE BUSINESSES IN AROUND NOT ONLY HAS THE- EMPLOYEE WHO WENT ON LEAVE LOST THEIR JOB EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S BEEN IN THAT BUSINESS IS ALSO LOST THEIR JOB AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW LARGER BUSINESSES CAN PERHAPS YOU KNOW SIX FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXCHANGE PEOPLE HAVE SOMEONE COVER FOR SOMEONE- THEY CAN SPREAD THE COSTS AROUND A LITTLE MORE. IN YES PROPORTIONALLY THE HAVE YOU KNOW CERTAIN NUMBER PEOPLE ON LEAVE BUT THEY CAN BALANCE IT OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL BUSINESS LISTING UNDER FIVE. WHEN YOU LOSE A KEY EMPLOYEE AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW THE ENTIRE LEGAL HISTORY OF THAT PROVISION IN THE LAW. THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE A KEY EMPLOYEE AND OF THAT PERSON'S GONE. YOU MAY OR MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN TEMPT FOR THAT IT DEPENDS- THAT PERSON WHO YOU'RE HIRING IS ATTEMPTED IS NOT GOING TO BE COMMITTED TO YOUR BUSINESS BECAUSE- ONLY ATTEMPT. IN FACT THE WILL IF SO THEY CAN FIND A PERMANENT JOB THEY'RE GOING OFF TO WORK THAT PERMANENT JOB. AND THEN YOU'RE NOW TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER PERSON TO COVER WHATEVER REMAINING PORTION IS LAUGHED BUT IT WITH THE CRITICAL PART OF THE JOB THEN ESSENTIALLY YOUR BUSINESS MAY GO BELLY UP BECAUSE THERE'S- WITHOUT FORGET. IT'S NOT JUST YOUR COSTS THAT YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT'S THE MATTER REVENUE YOU BRING AND SO IF YOUR BUSINESS ISN'T ABLE TO FUNCTION YOU NOT BRING IN ANY MONEY. TO PAY FOR ANY COSTS NOT JUST THE COST OF THE PERSONS ON LEAVE THE COST OF PAYING ANYONE ELSE THE RENT UTILITIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PERHAPS HEARING FROM SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CLEAN HELLO IT'S MONEY IN MY YEAH SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE BOOKS BALANCE. SO SINCE YOU SAID YES TO THE QUESTION ABOUT- PENDING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS- I UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW. THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR- I ACTUALLY. AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT WE SHOULD FIND A WAY TO GIVE EVERYONE LEAVE BUT WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT IN A WAY SO THAT THIS IS A REAL PROMISE. BECAUSE I HAVE WOULD HATE FOR BUSINESSES TO BE CLOSING FROM UNDERNEATH PEOPLE. WHO WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE TO LEAVE THAT'S THE WORST THING THAT WAY TO LOSE YOUR JOB- AND- AND ALSO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE LOSE THEIR JOBS OF THOSE AS WELL. AND SO- I WILL BE WILLING TO VOTE TO GET THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT FURTHER DISCUSSION- BUT I DO HOPE. THAT WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR'S HAD CONVERSATION WITH OUR LEADERSHIP AND- LEADERSHIP AND ASSEMBLY. THAT WE CAN HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT REALLY WERE VALUES ARE AND WHAT WE SHOULD COMMIT IN TERMS OF OUR RESOURCES TO BEING SURE THAT. WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE THE GET THE LEAVE THE PEOPLE IN A WAY. THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND THAT WE DON'T SIMPLY SAY WELL WE'LL PUT A RULE AND WE'LL PUT IT ON THE BACKS OF ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO MAKE IT ALL WORK OUT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF COST AND THAT WOULD POINT OUT YES IT'S- COVE IT IS A TIME WHEN WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE. IT'S ALSO A TIME WHEN BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING AND THEY DON'T THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOING. YOU KNOW PPP LOANS AND- DISASTER LOANS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO REVENUE SHORT AND- SO. LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION THAT WE CAN GET TO A POLICY GOAL TOGETHER. IN A WAY THAT. CAN GET US TO YOU KNOW WHAT. IT'S IT GETS REFLECTIVE OUR VALUES SO- WITH THAT. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND WITH% MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I THINK I SHARED GOALS OF TRYING TO BE SURE PEOPLE CAN GET BELIEVES THAT- THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AND THAT WE CREATED A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT OUR WORKPLACE IN A WAY THAT'S TRULY SUSTAINABLE. AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO AFTER JOBS THANK YOU. SENATE BILL. I DO A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THIS ON MY OWN. AIR AND. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. WERE SO FAR BEHIND OTHER COUNTRIES ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S ALMOST IS PRETTY MUCH OF BURSTING. I THINK THAT THE ECONOMIC. CONDITIONS THAT EXISTS IN AND- FAMILIES THAT HAVE PAID LEAVE. IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY WERE. SIMPLY A CHOICE HAS TO BE MADE BETWEEN YOUR- LOVE ONE AND KEEPING YOUR JOB AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS. BUT I HAVE A QUESTION HELLO THIS CAL CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. THE RESEARCH I'VE SEEN SHOWS THAT WERE WAY FAR BEHIND IS THAT IS THAT TRUE IS THAT A TRUE STATEMENT. COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR. OR BUDGET THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT PEOPLE YES SENATOR VAL- IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU'RE COMPARISON SET IS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE- MANY OF THE COUNTRIES AND NORTHERN EUROPE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS SOMETIMES COMPARED TO WHEN IT COMES TO THE SOCIAL BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT IT IS THE K. A. SAT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES WE DO NOT PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF BENEFITS IN AREAS LIKE THESE. THERE IS THERE A LIST OF THOSE YOU CAN COMPARE OUR OF. US TWO OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES. I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME BUT- YES YOU CAN CERTAINLY FIND WEST OF. THE BILL ALSO WHO ARE ROBUST WE'VE PROTECTIONS IN THERE AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE THEY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE ON THIS AND WE DO. HOW DO HOW DO THEY HOW DO THEY- DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE COMPLEXITIES WITH THE- SMALL BUSINESS THEY HAVE THEY HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THEY CAN DO. WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS HOW DO THEY- THERE WAS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES- OR HOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN SOME OF THESE. ANECDOTAL CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TODAY ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE. WELL SO WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT DATE WITH THEY WILL CERTAINLY VARY BY COUNTRY I THINK THAT- THE ONE THING I CAN SAY IS THAT IN A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES WHERE- THESE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE I DIDN'T IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS. SO SOCIETIES HAVE ADJUSTED- TO RECOGNIZING THE VALUE THESE PROTECTIONS WHILE ALSO KNOWING THAT THEY COME WITH SOME TRADE OFFS BUT THAT THE SOCIETY HAS ADJUSTED AS THE LAW HAS GONE INTO EFFECT AND- WE HAVE BEARING STATES AND THEY HAVE VERY LAWS ON THIS CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT IS THE AREA OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT- WE SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF NATIONAL. GENERAL LAW ON THIS SUBJECT. SHOULD THE GOVERNOR HAD AYE AYE AS FAR AS I KNOW HAS NOT WAITING ON ASK FEDERAL- LAW IN PARTICULAR- THE ADMINISTRATION IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF- JOB PROTECTED LEAVE AS WELL AS EXPANDED PAID FAMILY WEEDS SO WE'VE MADE THAT CLEAR IN THE STATE- I SHOULDN'T GO BEYOND WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID FOR THE STATE BUT HE IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THOSE OPPOSITION YEAH I THINK PERHAPS WE ARE A- CONSIDER WHEN WE CAN MAYBE WE CAN NOW BUT- SOME KIND OF. RESOLUTION OR STATEMENT FROM THE- FROM THE SENATE- PERHAPS OVER THE WORK WITH THE- OUR WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SPECIALLY. TO URGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING ON THAT I HEAR I HEAR THE COMPLAINTS I EAR THE PROBLEMS. BERMAN URGED URGE THAT- WE SUPPORT THIS AT THIS TIME. I THINK THAT- WERE WAY BEHIND. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE SENATE. OVER THE YEARS AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN HERE THAT'S FOURTEEN YEARS. AND IT BE NICE FOR ME PERSONALLY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THIS MY LAST YEAR IN THE SENATE. SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT IT'S. IS CHáVEZ A LONG TIME COMING. THANK YOU.
