00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.195
WHICH FOR REFERENCES FASTER

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:53.197
THAN THEIR LITTLE MORE THAN 5%

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:55.533
ANNUAL GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.133
REVENUES THAT HAS HAS OCCURRED

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.670
OVER THIS TIME PERIOD. I'M NEXT

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:01.472
GOING TO TURN TO DISCUSSING AN

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:05.276
HSA IN GREATER DETAIL. THE

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:07.244
IMAGES SAY ESTABLISHES A

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.313
VARIETY OF PARAMETERS OF HOW

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.315
THIS FUNDING MAY BE SPENT AND

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:12.883
WE SUMMARIZE THIS ON PAGE SEVEN

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.920
OF THE HAND OUT IN THE FIGURE.

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.521
SO AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE TOP

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:19.423
CIRCLE THE STATE DAMAGE SAY

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.759
RESERVES 5% OF TOTAL IMAGE SAY

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:22.426

ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.130
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THE

IS OFTEN KNOWN AS THE STATE CAP

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.602
SO AND WHILE SOME OF THIS

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:33.003
FUNDING IS USED FOR SAY

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.372
DIRECTED MINISTRATION GOING TO

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:36.006
THE OVERSIGHT AND

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:37.608
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION OR DH

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:39.810
YES. SOME FUNDING IS AVAILABLE

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:41.912
FOR GRANT OR OTHER PROGRAMS FOR

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:44.849
LEGISLATURE SUCH AS TO SEND

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.450
GRANTS TO COUNTIES TO HIRE

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:48.652
CRISIS PERSONNEL AND SO FORTH

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:51.689
SO THIS IS ANOTHER USE OF WITH

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:55.659
A OF THAT 5% STAKE CAP DOLLARS.

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.094
THE LARGER A PART OF THAT THAT

00:39:57.161 --> 00:39:58.729
THE CIRCLE THERE IS THEN GOES

00:39:58.796 --> 00:40:01.465
TO COUNTIES THIS 95% AND IT

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:04.235
GOES DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES. THIS

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:06.637
FUND THIS 95% OF FUNDING MUST

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.672
BE SPENT IN SPECIFIED

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:10.474
PERCENTAGES IN ONE OF THREE

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:13.611
WAYS. FOR AND THAT'S AND SO THE

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.579
BOTTOM CIRCLE ON THIS FIGURE

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.281
WILL DESCRIBE HOW THIS FUNDING

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.016
IS ULTIMATELY PRESCRIBED TO BE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:22.253
USED. 76% OF THIS FUNDING MUST

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.187
BE USED FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:33.197
MUST BE USED FOR PREVENTION AND

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:34.365

THEN 5% IS TO BE USED FOR

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.938
INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:43.808
EXPERIMENT WITH NEW APPROACHES.

TO AMELIORATING MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.248
BUT I'D THESE COULD BE SUICIDE

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:54.885
AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS OR OR EVEN

RECEIVE SORT OF TREATMENT

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:05.462
BEFORE THEIR ILLNESS BECOMES

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:11.368
TRULY DEBILITATING. I'M AND

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:14.471
THEN IN ADDITION TO THESE THREE

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.674
BUCKETS THEM WHICH IS A DOES

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.576

DOLLARS. THE PROCESS IDEALLY

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:45.095
WOULD HAVE REDISTRIBUTED THESE

00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:47.431

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:06.997
THAT PROVIDE PUBLIC FACING

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:09.233
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IMAGES A

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:11.969
FUNDS ARE SPENT AND SOME

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:15.739
INFORMATION ABOUT OUTCOMES.

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.573
I'LL CONCLUDE OUR PRESENTATION

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.741
WITH SOME ADDITIONAL OVER

00:46:17.808 --> 00:46:20.477
ARCHING ISSUES FOR THE

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:22.513
LEGISLATURE TO KEEP IN MIND IN

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.581
THIS AREA AND THE FIRST IS THAT

00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:25.849
STATE OVERSIGHT. OF THE IMAGES

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:29.219
SAY REMAINS CHALLENGING. STEPS

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.888
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO STRENGTHEN

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:32.022
STATE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:33.557
PROGRAM. BUT MANY OF THE STEPS

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:36.593
ARE NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.694
AND OTHER CHALLENGES REMAIN FOR

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.997
EXAMPLE FRAGMENTED OVERSIGHT

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:42.032
HAVING OVERSIGHT IN TWO

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:42.533
DIFFERENT AGENCIES WILL

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:45.602
CONTINUE TO REQUIRE AN ENHANCED

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:46.203
LEVEL OF COORDINATION IN ORDER

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:50.707
TO BE EFFECTIVE. ANOTHER ISSUE

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.543
AT AT AT A HIGH LEVEL IS THAT

00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:54.545
AND SERVICE COORDINATION ACROSS

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.713
THE MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF CARE

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.948
INVOLVED IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:46:58.015 --> 00:46:59.883
AND MENTAL HEALTH IS ALSO A

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.785
CHALLENGE THE IMAGES SAY FUNDED

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:02.953
ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE FOCUSING

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.155
ON TODAY MAKE UP ONLY A PORTION

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.290
OF THE STATE'S PUBLIC COMMUNITY

00:47:06.356 --> 00:47:08.125
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND IN

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:09.159
GENERAL THE SYSTEM IS

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:11.028
FRAGMENTED WITH A VARIETY OF

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:12.429
OVERLAPPING FUNDING STREAMS AND

00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:13.697
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND TARGET

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:15.933
POPULATIONS. AND ADDITIONALLY

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.067
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE NOT

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.435
WIDELY INTEGRATED WITH PHYSICAL

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.237
HEALTH SERVICES SO YOU CAN HAVE

00:47:20.304 --> 00:47:21.638
INDIVIDUALS INTERACTING WITH

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:24.141
MULTI PUBLIC SYSTEMS AND

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:24.741
COORDINATION AMONG THE SYSTEMS

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:28.345
IS DIFFICULT. FINALLY THE M.

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:29.580
HSA IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:30.948
SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.482
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN HOW THEY

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.483
STRUCTURE OPERATE THEIR

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.319
SERVICES. THIS FLEXIBILITY

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:38.555
ALLOWS FOR LOCAL INNOVATION. AN

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.190
ADAPTATION BUT CAN POTENTIALLY

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:42.326
CONFLICT WITH STATE LEVEL

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.094
INTEREST IN PROVIDING POLICY

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:46.063
DIRECTION AND MORE CONSISTENT

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:49.967
SERVICES AND OUTCOMES. SINCE

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.168
THE IMAGES THEY WAS ENACTED BY

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:52.803
VOTER INITIATIVE THERE ARE SOME

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:53.537
LIMITATIONS ON WHAT THE

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:56.039
LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO CHANGE

00:47:56.106 --> 00:47:57.541
THIS BALANCE HOWEVER THE

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:58.809
LEGISLATURE CAN AND HAS TAKEN

00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:00.611
SOME ACTIONS TO PROVIDE

00:48:00.677 --> 00:48:02.946
INCREASED STATE DIRECTION AND

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:04.114
ALSO TO INCREASE THE TECHNICAL

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.582
ASSISTANCE THAT IS PROVIDED TO

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.417
COUNTIES. TO PROMOTE BETTER

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.352
OUTCOMES IN THIS WILL BE

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.820
CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.455
THING FOR THE FOR THE STATE TO

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:14.891
DO WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:15.525
PRESENTATION HAVING TO TAKE ANY

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:16.126
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIS

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:19.763
MATERIAL. ANY QUESTIONS FROM

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:20.931
COMMITTEE MEMBERS BEFORE WE

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:21.965
HEAR AN UPDATE FROM THE IMAGES

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:22.366
SAY OVERSIGHT AND

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:26.069
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE.

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:42.152
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. AS

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.487
WAS NOTED THERE'S BEEN MORE

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.522
MONEY PUT INTO THE SYSTEM OVER

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:47.224
THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS AND

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:50.327
YET WE STILL SEE MANY ISSUES

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:53.063
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RECTIFIED BUT

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.930
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:57.200
COUNTIES. THAT HAVE HAD THE

00:48:57.267 --> 00:49:02.439
LARGE RESERVE. AND YOU SAID 33%

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:03.040
IS WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE IS THAT

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.842
WHAT YOU SAID. THAT'S CORRECT

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:06.877
LEGISLATION WAS PASSED THAT

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:09.980
LIMITS THE RESERVES 233% OF THE

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.715
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF MANY SERVICES

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:12.716
AND SUPPORT FUNDING THAT THEY

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.018
RECEIVE AND YET WE KNOW THAT

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.486
THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT HAD

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.388
MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND NOT

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.556
ALL NOTE ONE THING MY

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.758
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF

00:49:21.825 --> 00:49:23.327
THE LARGE BALANCES IN COUNTY

00:49:23.393 --> 00:49:24.928
ACCOUNTS WERE NOT NECESSARILY

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:27.397
IN WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:28.598
RESERVE THESE WERE UNSPENT

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.667
FUNDS THAT WERE. MEANT TO BE

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:31.935
SPENT WITHIN OTHER AND

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.570
COMPONENTS OF THE ACT I THINK

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.205
PRIMARILY OFTEN WITHIN THE

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:37.240
INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.576
ACTS OF THAT 5% IS RESERVED SO

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:40.744
THESE FUNDS WERE REALLY OUTSIDE

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.446
OF THE PRUDENT RESERVE AND

00:49:42.512 --> 00:49:44.214
SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVERTED

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.849
ACCORDING TO FOR THE THREE OR

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:48.352
FIVE YET WELL IT STARKLY WAS A

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:51.822
THREE YEAR WINDOW. SO YES SO I

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:52.656
DON'T I DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:55.158
MAYBE OUR MAYBE TOBY CAN HELP

00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:56.560
US IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT THE

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.729
PRUDENT RESERVE LEVELS ARE BUT

00:49:58.795 --> 00:50:00.664
THESE ARE SORT OF SEPARATE TO

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:02.766
SOME DEGREE SEPARATE ISSUES.

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.501
THANK YOU AGAIN TOBY LAYING THE

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:05.502
EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE MENTAL

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:08.805
HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:09.373
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:14.344
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. SO

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:16.313
THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. GENERALLY

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:17.214
USE OF THE TERM RESERVE FOR

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.048
UNSPENT FUND BALANCES AND IT

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:18.648
REALLY REFLECTS TO DIFFERENT

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:20.817
POTS OF MONEY. ONE IS A FORMAL

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.786
PRUDENT RESERVE THAT IS IN A

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:25.021
SPECIFIED BANK ACCOUNT. THAT

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.056
CAN ONLY BE TOUCHED UNDER

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:28.291
CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND THAT

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:30.794
PRUDENT RESERVE IS NOT SUBJECT

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.095
TO REVERSION IT IS INTENDED TO

00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:35.065
BE A RAINY DAY FUND.

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:35.599
RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A

00:50:35.665 --> 00:50:39.603
VOLATILE REVENUE STREAM. THERE

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:40.871
HAS BEEN A WIDE VARIATION IN

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.639
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:43.240
COUNTIES WERE HOLDING IN THEIR

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:46.176
PRUDENT RESERVE. I JUST PART ME

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:46.710
LEGISLATION WAS PASSED TO

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:50.013
BELIEVE LAST YEAR. THAT LIMITED

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.481
AMOUNT OF FUN TO BE HELD IN A

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:53.016
PRUDENT RESERVE TO AS THE LA

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.852
HAS REPORTED A THIRD OF YOUR

00:50:55.919 --> 00:51:00.957
AVERAGED CSS FUND. THE VAST

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:03.427
BULK OF THE DOLLARS THAT

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.195
LEGISLATORS MEMBERS OF THE

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:06.363
PUBLIC AND KIND OF SUPERVISORS

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.265
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT ARE

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.333
FUNDS THAT ARE ON SPENT SORT OF

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.035
HEALTH AND WHAT WE MIGHT CALL

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:13.370
THE CASH FLOW OR AN INFORMAL

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:15.439
RESERVE. THERE ARE NO

00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:16.873
RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.942
FUNDS THAT CAN BE THAT CAN BE

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:21.178
LEFT IN THE ACCOUNT. HOWEVER

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.013
THERE IS A REQUIREMENT

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.315
ORIGINALLY THE IMAGE TO SAY

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:25.916
SAID COUNTIES HAVE THREE YEARS

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:29.186
TO USE THE FUNDS. FOR THE FUNDS

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.086
SHALL BE RETURNED TO THE STATE

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:30.654
FOR REDISTRIBUTION TO OTHER

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.722
COUNTIES. AS PART OF

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:35.459
LEGISLATION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:37.828
AB ONE FOURTEEN THE THREE YEAR

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:40.096
RULE WAS AMENDED TO BE THREE

00:51:40.163 --> 00:51:41.865
YEARS FOR MOST COUNTIES FIVE

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.800
YEARS FOR SMALL COUNTIES. THE

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:46.136
ARGUMENT WAS THAT COUNTY STATED

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.471
MORE TIME TO PLAY SMALLER

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:49.439
COUNTIES WHO ARE REQUIRED TO

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.141
DISTRIBUTE THEIR DOLLARS INTO

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.476
AT LEAST THREE POTS COMMUNITY

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.978
SERVICES SUPPORTS PREVENTION OR

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:55.846
INTERVENTION AND INNOVATION IN

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:58.415
THE ARGUMENT WAS THAT. THEY

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.316
THEY WOULD NEED MORE TIME TO

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:02.419
ACCUMULATE FUNDS TO THE FOR

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.053
INNOVATION SO THEY COULD INVEST

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:06.423
IN SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS. THE

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.793
DATE AT THAT I'M MY MEMORY IS

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.194
THAT OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS THAT

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.763
WEREN'T IN A PRUDENT RESERVE

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.131
THAT WERE BEYOND THE THREE YEAR

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:18.401
LIMITATION ABOUT 57% OF THAT

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:22.606
WITH INNOVATION MAYBE SIXTY

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:25.375
FIVE BUT CLOSE TO HALF WAS

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.910
PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.245
OR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:30.447
SUPPORTS. SO WE THOUGHT THIS

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:32.048
CHALLENGE SORT OF ACROSS THE

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:34.351
FIND ACROSS THE COMPONENTS OF

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:37.320
THE M. HSA I'M WE ALSO SAW MANY

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:39.556
COUNTIES THAT DID NOT HAVE A

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:40.590
CHALLENGE AND SPENDING DOWN

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.626
THERE FUND BALANCE BUT A LARGER

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.628
PROPORTION OF COUNTIES THAT

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:47.597
WERE ACCRUING LARGE FUND

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:48.164
BALANCES AND IN THIS SORT OF

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:51.368
CASH FLOW RESERVE. I HOPE THAT

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:54.271
ANSWERS. A IT DOES BUT IT BUT I

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:55.472
GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IS

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:58.208
AND TWENTY JUNE OF TWENTY

00:52:58.275 --> 00:52:59.442
EIGHTEEN ON THE FLOOR OF THE

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.211
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A BILL THAT

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:03.213
WAS BEING MOVE FORWARD THAT IF

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.882
COUNTY TENANTS SPENT THEIR

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:08.018
MONEY THAT IT WOULD GO BACK

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:10.520
INTO A POOL OF FUNDING AND THEN

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.889
THEY STILL COULD REAPPLY FOR IT.

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.357
I WASN'T NECESSARILY AGAINST

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:15.592
THAT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:17.494
SHOULD BE USING THEIR FUNDS AND

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.828
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT USING THE

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:19.763
FUNDS THEY ARE PUTTING THEM

00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:22.132
INTO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS. AND

00:53:22.198 --> 00:53:23.733
EVEN FOR THE AUDITOR AND I'M

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.835
TALKING ABOUT ORANGE COUNTY IS

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:27.470
VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO FIND

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.172
OKAY WHY ARE THESE IN DIFFERENT

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:30.006
ACCOUNTS AND THEN YOU HAVE

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:32.242
INTEREST AND ALL THOSE THINGS.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.743
BUT I DIDN'T SUPPORT THAT BILL

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.612
BECAUSE I FELT THAT AT THAT

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.080
POINT IT WOULD GIVE COUNTIES

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.315
WHO HAVEN'T REALLY WANTED TO

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:40.016
USE THE FUNDS AND THAT'S A

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.985
PHILOSOPHY ISSUE OR A POLITICAL

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.087
ISSUE. THE REASON TO SAY WE'LL

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.488
SEE NOW THE STATE TOOK THE FUN

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.890
SO WE CAN'T USE THEM SO I

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:50.193
PUSHED FOR US TO NOT PASS THAT

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.461
YOU REMEMBER THAT. AND IT

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.463
DIDN'T PASSED SO THEN IF YOU

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:55.265
CAN JUST GIVE ME UP TO SPEED

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.766
AFTER THAT THAT DIDN'T PASSED

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:59.636
IN JUNE. AND THEN YOU SAID THAT

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:01.438
THERE WAS. AND I SHOULD KNOW

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.606
THIS BUT I'M COMPLETELY

00:54:02.672 --> 00:54:04.574
FORGETTING THEN DID YOU SAY WE

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:06.576
PASSED ANOTHER BILL AND NOW

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:09.546
THAT DOES PUT A THREE TO FIVE

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:14.384
YEARS. ON IT. ON USING THE

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:17.420
FUNDS YES THANK YOU IT'S A

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:18.021
LITTLE BIT HISTORY HERE THAT'S

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:18.555
IMPORTANT WHEN THE MENTAL

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:19.155
HEALTH SERVICES ACT WAS FIRST

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:22.025
IMPLEMENTED. THE FUNDS CAME TO

00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:23.093
THE STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH FUND

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:24.894
MEDICAL SERVICES FUND AND IT

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:26.630
SAT THERE AND ACCUMULATED

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.231
COUNTIES DEVELOPED EXPENDITURE

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:30.500
PLANS SUBMITTED THEM TO THE

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:31.434
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH.

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.603
FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. WHEN

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:34.571
THE STATE APPROVED AN

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:36.606
EXPENDITURE THEY WOULD IN

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:38.541
ESSENCE ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS TO

00:54:38.608 --> 00:54:40.377
THE COUNTY AND THAT STARTED THE

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:42.112
CLOCK THE THREE O'CLOCK AND THE

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:44.014
ARGUMENT WAS THAT YOU HAVE

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:44.981
THREE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT YOUR

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:46.383
PLAN AND IF YOU FAIL TO

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:48.284
IMPLEMENT YOUR PLAN. GIVE THE

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:51.688
MONEY BACK MUCH LIKE A GRANT.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:53.189
OVER TIME THERE WERE DELAYS IN

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.091
THE COUNTY IN IN THE ABILITY OF

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:56.593
THE STATE TO ACTUALLY REVIEW

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.495
AND APPROVE A COUNTY PROPOSAL.

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.096
AT THE SAME TIME REVENUES WERE

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.731
ACCUMULATING IN THE STATE FUND

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:02.999
THE STATE COULD NOT DISTRIBUTE

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.834
THE MONEY FAST ENOUGH. THE

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.270
LEGISLATURE CHANGE THE RULES

00:55:07.337 --> 00:55:08.938
AND DETERMINED THAT THE FUNDS

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:10.640
THAT COME INTO THE STATE MENTAL

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.741
HEALTH SERVICES FUND WOULD NOW

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:13.343
BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE COUNTIES.

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:14.611
THINK OF THIS AS A DIRECT

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:16.946
DEPOSIT SO EVERY MONTHDOLLARS

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.415
COME IN THEY GET DISTRIBUTED TO

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:18.915
THE COUNTIES BASED ON A

00:55:18.982 --> 00:55:20.717
FORMULA. HI MY COLLEAGUES AT

00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:21.251
THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:23.753
SERVICES CAN ARTICULATE MORE

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:24.354
THAN WHAT THAT FORMULA IS AND

00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:27.390
HOW THAT WORKS. THE RULES

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:27.957
REGARDING REVERSION HAD BEEN

00:55:28.024 --> 00:55:31.561
WRITTEN. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.497
STATE AUTHORIZING A AN

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:35.765
EXPENDITURE AND IN ESSENCE

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.667
WRITING A CHECK WIN THE

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.936
LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.538
LARGE FUND BALANCES AND MOVED

00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:43.940
TO A DIRECT DEPOSIT STRATEGY

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:45.008
THE REVERSION ROLES WERE NOT

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:48.478
UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT AND IT

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:49.045
CREATED CONFUSION OVER WIND

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.981
IT'S THE CLOCK STARTS. AND IT

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:53.483
AND WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.720
RIVERS POLICY THAT WAS OUTLINED

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.354
WITH THE CASH FLOW PROCESS THAT

00:55:58.421 --> 00:56:01.057
WAS NOW IN PLACE. WHEN THE

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:02.959
COMMISSION LOOKED AT THIS WE

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.428
LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE OF FIRST

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:07.764
FISCAL REPORTING BECAUSE WE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.265
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDS HAVE

00:56:09.332 --> 00:56:10.967
BEEN RECEIVED SPENT OR ARE LEFT

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.135
IN THE BANK WITHOUT ACTUALLY

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:14.137
GETTING THE REPORTS AND THAT

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.405
WAS A PROBLEM AND THE AUDITOR

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.073
IDENTIFIED THAT AS WELL. AND

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.175
THEN WE LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:20.877
HOW CAN WE CALCULATE UNSPENT

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.113
FUNDS WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM. WE

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.781
KNEW BASED ON A REPORT TO WE

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:26.516
DID HAVE THAT THERE WERE FUNDS

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:27.650
THAT HAD BEEN SITTING IN COUNTY

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.286
ACCOUNTS GOING BACK EIGHT YEARS

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:31.521
AND SO THE THREE O'CLOCK HAD

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:33.623
CLEARLY EXPIRED. YET BUT THE

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.625
STATE DID NOT HAVE A PROCESS

00:56:35.692 --> 00:56:37.894
FOR ACTUALLY CALCULATING

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.396
UNSPENT FUNDS AND CAPS FOR

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:42.298
BRINGING THOSE DOLLARS BACK

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:42.832
THIS PUT THE COUNTIES IN A

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:47.137
PARTICULAR BEHIND. BECAUSE THEY

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:47.771
WERE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS ON A

00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:49.706
DIRECT DEPOSIT BASIS. BUT THEY

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:50.473
HADN'T SPENT THE MEN OF THE

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.642
DEADLINE. THEY WERE THE THERE

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:53.943
WAS NO PROCESS THAN TO GIVE THE

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.479
DOLLARS BACK. SO IF THEY WERE

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:57.914
TO SPEND DOLLARS THAT THEY

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:59.249
LATER HAD TO RETURN TO THE

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.117
STATE. THEY WOULD BE STOCK

00:57:01.184 --> 00:57:03.219
HAVING TO FIND ADDITIONAL

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:03.820
REVENUES TO PAY BACK THE STATE

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:06.055
SO TO SPEAK. THIS WASN'T THE

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:07.824
ONLY REASON BUT IT WAS ONE OF

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.726
THE REASONS WHY WE STARTED TO

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.761
SEE LARGE BALANCES BECAUSE WE

00:57:11.828 --> 00:57:12.295
DIDN'T HAVE THE PROCESS IN

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.231
PLACE TO. SPEND THE MONEY

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:16.699
QUICKLY IN SOME INSTANCES BUT

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:19.302
ALSO TO REVERT THE DOLLARS AT

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:19.769
THE POINT IN TIME THAT

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.806
REVERSION WAS REQUIRED. THE

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.973
COMMISSION'S WORK THE AUDITOR'S

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.742
WORK REALLY FOCUSED ON THE

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.810
STATE PUTTING IN PLACE THE

00:57:26.876 --> 00:57:29.078
STRATEGY TO CREATE CLARITY.

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:31.214
AROUND WHAT THE RULES ARE HOW

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.782
MUCH MONEY UNDER WHAT

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:33.416
CONDITIONS AND HOW THOSE MONIES

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:36.553
COME BACK. I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:37.153
WITH THE BILL AS YOU DESCRIBED

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:42.625
IT. BUT THE REVERSION ROLE WAS

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:43.159
WRITTEN INTO THE ORIGINAL

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:43.760
INITIATIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:48.431
FOUR. AND THERE WAS A BILL TO

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:49.332
CREATE A MENTAL HEALTH FOR

00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:51.267
VERSION FUND AND THE

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:52.435
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.404
COMMISSION HAD MADE WAS THAT

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.972
ANY REVERTED FUND SHOULD GO

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:58.241
INTO THAT FUND FOR THREE

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:00.109
REASONS ONE WE WANTED TO CREATE

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:02.412
TRANSPARENCY AROUND FUNDS THAT

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:04.147
WERE SEPARATE TO REVERSION WE

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:07.183
FELT THAT. HIGHLIGHTING THAT

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.586
THE REALITY OF COUNTIES NOT

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:10.153
SPENDING FUNDS WOULD CHANGE

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:15.491
BEHAVIOR. WE ALSO THE WHAT THE

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:17.493
LAW SAYS IS REVERTED FINDS WILL

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.828
BE REDISTRIBUTED TO OTHER

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:19.395
COUNTIES TO MEET ADDITIONAL

00:58:19.462 --> 00:58:22.932
NEEDS. IN THE TIME WHEN THE

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.367
STATE WAS APPROVING COUNTY

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.702
EXPENDITURE PLANS IN WRITING

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.637
CHECKS THAT MADE TREMENDOUS

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:29.239
SENSE THE MONEY IS NOW BACK IN

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.740
THE BANK ACCOUNT. AND THAT

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.076
PROCESS WOULD MOVE FORWARD.

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.878
CURRENTLY FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED

00:58:34.944 --> 00:58:36.880
THROUGH A WAITED FORMULA

00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:37.914
LARGELY BASED ON POPULATION WE

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:41.484
WERE CONCERNED THAT. REVERTED

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:42.719
FUNDS WOULD JUST GO BACK INTO

00:58:42.785 --> 00:58:44.454
THE MAIN POT AND WOULD BE

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.656
DISTRIBUTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.424
IF A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:50.393
FOR INNOVATION FUNDS THEY WOULD

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.729
LOSE THE INNOVATION STATUS AND

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:54.364
BECOME CORE SERVICES FUNDS AND

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:55.732
SO WE FELT THAT THE

00:58:55.798 --> 00:58:56.966
REDISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.569
INTENTIONAL RATHER THAN JUST

00:58:59.636 --> 00:59:01.271
BASED ON A WEIGHTED FORMULA.

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:03.573
AND WE RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.408
LEGISLATURE BEING IDENT BEING

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.644
ABLE TO IDENTIFY KEY STATEWIDE

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:10.280
PRIORITIES FOR DISTRIBUTION OF

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:10.880
THOSE FUNDS. AGAIN SO THAT IT

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:15.084
WAS INTENTIONAL. THE SENATOR

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:15.685
BELL HAD A BILL THAT ESTABLISH

00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:17.453
THE FINE FOR REVERSION BUT IT

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.722
DID NOT PUT ANY REQUIREMENTS OR

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:20.924
DIRECTION ON HOW THE FUNDS

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.859
WOULD BE USED. SO TO MY

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.528
KNOWLEDGE THE ANY MONEY THAT IS

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:26.095
SUBJECT TO RIVERS AND WOULD

00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:28.298
SIMPLY BE REDISTRIBUTED. IN

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.899
THAT FORMULA ONE OF THE

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.634
CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS THE

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.969
INTERPRETATION OF THE ORIGINAL

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.470
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS TWO OTHER

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:36.472
COUNTIES SO THAT WOULD MEAN IN

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:38.207
THE ORANGE COUNTY CASE. WOULD

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:39.742
THEY GET A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.878
OWN FUNDS BACK OR WHAT THE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.680
DEPARTMENT BE REQUIRED TO COME

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.248
UP WITH A WAITED FORMULA THAT

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:47.317
REDISTRIBUTED COUNTIES FUNDING

00:59:47.383 --> 00:59:49.218
FROM A SINGLE COUNTY TO ALL OF

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:52.255
THE OTHER COUNTIES WHICH JUST

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:52.789
BECOMES. VERY COMPLICATED

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:56.726
OVERTIME. WELL I THINK ONE OF

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:57.827
THE THINGS THAT WAS INTERESTING

00:59:57.894 --> 00:59:59.629
TO ME WAS AT ONE POINT THE

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.464
ORANGE COUNTY OUR AUDITOR WAS

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:02.966
NOTING THAT HE BELIEVES THAT

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.901
THERE WAS UP TO TWO. BETWEEN

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.669
TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED AND

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:07.904
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND- IN

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.606
RESERVES. WHICH WAS VERY

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.508
UPSETTING TOO MANY PEOPLE IN

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.544
THE COUNTY AS WE HAD CONTINUED

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.980
TO SEE A LARGE NEED TO USE

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.215
THOSE FUNDS. SO THAT WAS ONE OF

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:20.783
THE ISSUES BUT THEN IT WAS A

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.151
TODD GLORIA BILL I DON'T

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.787
REMEMBER THE NUMBER. AND HE WAS

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.022
FRUSTRATED WHICH IS WHY HE

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:28.791
BROUGHT IT TO THE FLOOR AND IN

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.493
ADDITION TO THE COUNTY IS BEING

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.596
ABLE TO RE APPLY FOR THE FUNDS

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.797
IF THEY WERE REVERTED. THEY

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.666
WERE ALSO GOING TO ADD SPECIAL

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:38.468
DISTRICTS IN I BELIEVE SCHOOL

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:41.204
DISTRICTS THAT DIDN'T MOVE

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.574
FORWARD AND- SO MIKE RATIONALE

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.043
IN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS IS.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.845
THAT YOU WERE RIGHT IN THE

01:00:48.911 --> 01:00:51.247
SENSE THAT MAKING THIS MUCH

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.850
MORE TRANSPARENT HAS PUSHED. AT

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:56.352
LEAST ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.554
ASSUMING OTHER COUNTIES IN TO

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.390
STARTING TO USE THESE FUNDS IN

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:01.791
A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WAY AND

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.693
I DO GET. YOU KNOW SAY THEY

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.361
WANT TO BUILD A MENTAL HEALTH

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.963
FACILITY IN YOUR USING SOME OF

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.265
THOSE DOLLARS THAT CAN BE USED

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.167
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY JUST

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.302
TAKE. TWO YEARS OR IT COULD

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:15.438
STRETCH AND A THREE TO FIVE BUT

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.373
THE URGENCY HAS BEEN THERE AND

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.608
NOW I THINK SOME OF THIS

01:01:18.674 --> 01:01:20.376
PRESSURE IS FORCING THEM. TO

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:21.511
USETHEM AND TO BE MORE

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:22.979
TRANSPARENT SO THAT'S A GOOD

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:24.547
THING WE JUST WANT TO SEE THE

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:28.151
MONEY. FROM THE STATE GET TO

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:35.992
THE COUNTY AND THE MUSIC.

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:37.560
DIRECTOR EWING I THINK NOT

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:38.194
THERE'S A GREAT TIME IF YOU CAN

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:38.795
JUST YOU KNOW KIND OF GIVE US

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:39.695
AN OVERVIEW AND AN INTERACTION

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:40.296
OF THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.097
OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:42.065
COMMISSION AND THE WORK THAT

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.565
YOU ALL HAVE BEEN DOING

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:43.633
PARTICULARLY IN RESPONSE TO.

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.233
THE AUDIT AND IN RESPONSE TO

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.868
SOME THE SAME CONCERNS THAT.

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:46.602
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:48.871
ANOTHER HAVE RAISED THANK YOU.

ABSOLUTELY I GUESS WHAT I'D

01:01:51.707 --> 01:01:54.444
LIKE TO. KIND OF PREFACE MY

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.611
COMMENTS AROUND THE FISCAL

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.313
TRANSPARENCY PACE WHICH ALL AUG

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.481
GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.951
DETAIL. WITH QUITE OFTEN WHEN

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.053
WE PRESENT PUBLICLY ABOUT THE

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.354
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.723
REALLY TRY TO HIGHLIGHT THE

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.158
POLICY SIDE OF THE MENTAL

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.593
HEALTH SERVICES ACT. IN

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.228
ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THE

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:14.163
FUNDING IS TREMENDOUS IN IN IN

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.131
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IT

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.799
CREATES. BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.134
OF PIECES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:20.636
SERVICES ACT THAT ARE REALLY

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:25.808
QUITE UNIQUE AND THAT. ALLOWS

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:26.409
CALIFORNIA TO STAND APART FROM

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:30.580
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ONE IS

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:31.447
THE MANDATE FOR PREVENTION AND

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:32.782
EARLY INTERVENTION. OF THE DAY

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:33.483
THE MAIL HOW SERVICES ACT

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.618
RECOGNIZED VERY EARLY ON THAT

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.120
OUR SYSTEM IS WHAT WE OFTEN

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.454
REFERRED TO AS A FAIL FIRST

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:41.190
SYSTEM. BECAUSE MEDIC HOW AND

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.291
MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:45.862
DIAGNOSIS BASED YOU HAVE TO

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.496
MEET A LEVEL OF SEVERITY BEFORE

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:48.731
YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE. WE

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.900
DON'T DO THIS IN OTHER ASPECTS

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.568
OF HEALTH CARE WE DON'T DO THIS

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:55.671
IN IN IN TERMS OF OUR

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:57.440
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OR THE

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.040
OTHER WAYS WHICH WE TRY TO

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.643
SERVE FAMILIES. BUT SO MUCH OF

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.078
OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.814
BEEN BUILT UPON A SYSTEM THAT.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:05.515
THAT THE LITTLE WHO ARE

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.583
COMMISSION IN THE YEAR TWO

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.851
THOUSAND DESCRIBED AS RATIONING

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.387
ACCESS TO CARE THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.222
MEET A LEVEL OF SEVERITY. IF

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.525
YOU'RE IF YOU IN ORDER TO BE

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:17.426
ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES. MENTAL

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:20.296
HEALTH SERVICES ACT CREATES A

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:20.930
MANDATE FOR PREVENTION WHICH IS

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:24.200
HIGHLY UNUSUAL. ANDERSON MORE

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.201
RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.068
THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.371
DIRECTED TO ACTUALLY. DEVELOP A

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.605
STATEWIDE FRAMEWORK AND

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:30.873
STRATEGY AROUND PREVENTION AND

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.575
EARLY INTERVENTION. BUT IT'S

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.310
THE POLICY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.712
SERVICES ACT WHICH IS SO

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.915
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.783
WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THE

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.685
ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:44.654
UNEMPLOYMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.389
CONSUMERS OF JAIL INVOLVEMENT

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:47.790
OF EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:49.725
FACING A CHILLED OUR CHILDREN

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.060
WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:53.296
THAT IN TERMS OF PREVENTION.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.364
EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGY AND

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.499
THAT'S THAT THAT'S A

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.968
SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL SHIFT FOR.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.970
MENTAL HEALTH FIELD IN GENERAL

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:02.638
BUT CERTAINLY FOR AT THE STATE

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:05.074
LOCAL FOR OUR STATE OF

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:05.675
CALIFORNIA AND FOR COUNTIES IN

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:06.275
TERMS OF HOW WE DELIVER MENTAL

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:09.612
HEALTH CARE. THE SECOND PIECE

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:10.213
OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.547
ACT THAT THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:13.082
STAND APART EVEN MORE AND

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.784
CREATES TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.285
IS THE INNOVATION COMPONENT

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:18.120
TONIGHT I HAVE TO. RECOGNIZE MY

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.422
COLLEAGUES IN THE ALLEY WE TRY

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.756
REALLY HARD TO CREATE THESE

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.092
VISUALS OF HOW THE MONEY FLOWS

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:23.926
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:24.594
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.597
COMPLEXITY TO IT. THERE IS A 5%

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.199
SET ASIDE FOR INNOVATION THAT'S

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.601
RUNNING ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.769
DOLLARS A YEAR AS THE LA

01:04:33.836 --> 01:04:34.971
COMMENTED THAT IS THE ONE

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:40.343
COMPONENT. TO SPEND THOSE

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.378
DOLLARS WE ALLOW THOSE DOLLARS

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.879
TO BE SPENT ACROSS FIVE FISCAL

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.948
YEARS WHICH MEANS THERE'S FIVE

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:46.582
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PLAY

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:50.486
FOR INNOVATION. THE REASON THIS

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.688
IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE IT'S

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.857
THIS VERY EXPLICIT POLICY THAT

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.526
SAYS WE HAVE TO IMPROVE AND IT

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.661
IS NOT JUST A TOOL THAT'S

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.396
ACTUALLY MANDATE COUNTIES ARE

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.898
REQUIRED TO DEVELOP PROPOSALS

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.300
TO STRENGTHEN THEIR MENTAL

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:05.368
HEALTH SYSTEMS USING THESE

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.236
INNOVATION DOLLARS. SO I WANT

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.938
TO I WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.606
IN THAT THE VALUE OF THE M.

01:05:10.673 --> 01:05:13.409
HSA. INCLUDES THE FUNDS BUT

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.177
IT'S THE APPROACH TO DELIVERING

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:17.947
CARE THAT REALLY IS THE CRUX OF

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:20.383
THE ACT FOCUSED ON RECOVERY.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.617
AND WITHIN THE P. E. I.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:23.986
COMPONENT IT OUTLINES SEVEN KEY

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.088
OUTCOMES THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.657
BE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.091
HEALTH AND WELL BEING NOT

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:30.826
ILLNESS RESPONSE AND THAT

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:33.029
INCLUDES HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.797
AVOIDING JAIL INVOLVEMENT.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:37.733
AVOIDING THE CHILD WELFARE

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.367
SYSTEM MEANING KEEPING FAMILIES

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:42.905
INTACT. AND SO IT IT IT IT ALSO

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:43.439
INCLUDES REDUCING SCHOOL

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.540
FAILURE WOULD LIKE TO SAY

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.442
SUPPORTING EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.477
I THINK INCREASINGLY WHILE.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:50.146

OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR

01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:54.583
ADULTS PLUS OUR CRIMINAL

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.419
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WHEN IT

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.554
COMES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH. I

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.489
CANNOT SET FOOT ON A SCHOOL

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.692
WITHOUT A TEACHER OR PRINCIPAL

01:06:02.758 --> 01:06:03.259

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:04.487
ISSUE THAT CAME UP WERE THE

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.289
LARGE UNSPENT FUND BALANCES.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:08.357
PUTTING THE DATA OUT THERE I

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.092
WOULD ARGUE MORE SO THAN THE

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:11.694
REVERSION POLICY HAS WHAT IS

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:12.962

THE REGULATORY LIMITATIONS OF

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:53.235
THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.003
WHICH IS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.605
MP I ONLY. WE ARE ASKING THE

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.407
COUNTIES TO ACTUALLY GIVE US

01:07:58.474 --> 01:07:59.775
DETAILED INFORMATION ON WHO IS

STATUS WHAT WE WANT IS THE

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.387
PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:12.922
COUNTIES ARE PRIORITIZING USES

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:14.890
OF THESE FUNDS. OUR INTENT IS

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.425
NOT TO TELL COUNTIES WHAT THEIR

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.761
PRIORITIES ARE OUR INTENT IS TO

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.296
SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY PLANNING

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.598
PROCESS THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER

THE COULD THE COMMISSION SEES

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.243
THAT STRATEGY HAS PUBLIC

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.745
ACCOUNTABILITY RATHER THAN THE

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:37.847
SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS DECIDING

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.781
WHICH COUNTIES ARE DOING IT

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:39.915
RIGHT WHICH KIND OF TO DOING IT

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:42.117
WRONG THE IDEA IS TO EMPOWER

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:45.154
THE PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.355
WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM

01:08:46.422 --> 01:08:47.857
INFORMATION ON FUNDING ON

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.159

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.094
THE OUTCOMES ACHIEVED. WHEN I

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.163
TALK TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:54.663
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR FROM

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.231
GOVERNMENT THEY WANT SYSTEMS

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:57.666
THAT WORK. AND WHAT THEY WANT

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.301
TO KNOW IS ARE WE MAKING SMART

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.503
DECISIONS WITH HOW WE SPEND

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.172
MONEY. ARE WE MAKING SMART

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:03.706
DECISIONS WITH WHAT WE'RE

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:05.174
BUYING THE SERVICES WERE PAYING

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.976
FOR. AND DO THOSE SERVICES

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.878
RESULT IN YOUR PEOPLE GOING TO

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.446
JAIL YOUR PEOPLE HOMELESS

01:09:10.513 --> 01:09:11.981
LIVING ON THE STREETS MORE

PARENTS CAPABLE OF. KEEPING

THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:16.986
HOUSEHOLD IN AVOIDING THE CHILD

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:18.120
WELFARE SYSTEM X. AT OUR

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:20.322
CENTER. WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.858
THEN IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:23.459
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.828
CARE SERVICES AND THE COUNTIES

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:26.962
TO STRENGTHEN FISCAL

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.331
TRANSPARENCY WHEN WE STARTED.

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:32.201
THERE WERE ZERO COUNTIES WERE

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.202
SUBMITTING THEIR FINANCIAL

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:35.337
REPORTS ON TIME SOME COUNTIES

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.640
HAD SUBMITTED REPORTS IN FIVE

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.841
TO SEVEN YEARS LOTS OF REASONS

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.076
FOR THAT. SOME UNDERSTANDABLE

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:43.879
MANY OF THEM NOT TODAY I THINK

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:45.381
WE'RE AT A 100% REPORTING.

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:48.050
RIGHT WE SAW VERY LARGE FUND

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:51.186
BALANCES AND LITTLE ATTENTION

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.187
IN TERMS OF THESE DOLLARS THAT

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:52.721
WERE SITTING IN THE BANK

01:09:52.788 --> 01:09:55.291
ACCOUNTS. I CANNOT GIVE YOU AN

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:57.793
UPDATE TODAY ON UNSPENT FUNDS

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.762
AND I CAN EXPLAIN THAT BUT I

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.997
CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY THAT.

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:03.732
COUNTY AFTER COUNTY IS WORKING

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:07.469
HARD TO STREAMLINED HOW THEY

01:10:07.536 --> 01:10:08.103
SPEND THESE DOLLARS TO PUT MORE

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:12.207
PROGRAMS IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.175
THAT AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THIS

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.076
MORE ON THE SECOND PANEL. WE

01:10:14.143 --> 01:10:14.810
HAVE BEEN FACILITATING CROSS

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.879
COUNTY LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.213
WE HAVE BEEN INCENTIVIZING

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.449
PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE BEEN SORT

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.818
OF RAISING THE FLAG AND SAYING

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:23.619
HEY WHO'S INTERESTED. AND THE

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:24.820
COUNTIES ARE BEING VERY

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:27.022
RESPONSIVE BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.091
THEIR USE OF THEIR OWN DATA.

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.426
TRYING TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.227
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN DATA

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:33.295
TRYING TO STREAMLINE THAT

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:36.365
PROCESS GET MORE MONEY OUT. THE

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.934
TRANSPARENCY HAS HAD THE IMPACT

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:40.269
THAT WE HAD HOPED IT WOULD HAVE

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.104
WHICH WAS MORE CONVERSATION

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.506
MORE UNDERSTANDING. AND MORE

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.042
OPENNESS AND WILLINGNESS TO

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:47.610
ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND TRY

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.812
THINGS WE HAVEN'T TRIED BEFORE.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.980
TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC ISSUES

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.281
THAT THE AUDIT REYES RELATIVE

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.316
TO THE COMMISSION AROUND

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.618
STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR THE

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:57.119
TRIAGE PROGRAM AND

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:59.588
CLARIFICATION ON INNOVATIONS WE

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:01.023
HAVE A DASHBOARD IN FRONT OF

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:02.324
YOU THAT SHOWS THE APPROVAL

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.226
RATES FOR INNOVATIONS THOSE

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.327
RATES. AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:06.629
HIGH I THINK IT WAS A LOT OF

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.330
MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THE

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.465
COUNTY IS ABOUT. WHAT

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:11.634
INNOVATION MEANS. SOME OF THAT

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.569
WAS A LACK OF CLARITY ON THE

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:14.703
COMMISSION'S PART SOME OF IT

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.438
WAS JUST THE DIFFICULTY OF

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:17.072
GETTING THIS INFORMATION OUT TO

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:17.740
LOTS AND LOTS OF DIVERSE

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:20.342
COUNTIES. SO I THINK WE'VE

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:25.247
ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE QUITE.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:25.848
COMPREHENSIVELY ON THE TRIAGE

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:28.884
PIECE. WHAT THE AUDITOR WAS

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.152
SAYING IS WHEN WE FIRST ISSUED

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.820
TRIAGE FUNDS EACH COUNTY WAS

01:11:31.887 --> 01:11:32.788
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.823
INTERNAL EVALUATION. AND SO

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.558
THERE WAS NOT A STATE WIDE

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.827
PICTURE OF THE DOLLARS BECAUSE

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.195
THE PICTURE WAS INDIVIDUAL

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:42.598
COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE MOVED

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:43.499
TOWARDS A STATE LEVEL

01:11:43.565 --> 01:11:45.367
EVALUATION SO WE CAN TELL A

01:11:45.434 --> 01:11:47.236
MORE BROAD PICTURE WE LOSE THE

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.737
NUANCE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN AN

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.472
INDIVIDUAL COUNTY BUT WE GAIN A

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.907
BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND- WE

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.709
HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE WITH

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:56.979
UCLA AND UC DAVIS. TO SUPPORT A

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:57.880
STATEWIDE EVALUATION FOR THE

01:11:57.946 --> 01:11:59.581
TRIAGE DOLLARS SO WHAT WE

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.482
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.117
CHALLENGES WITH THAT BECAUSE

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.786
THERE'S SUCH DIVERSITY AND HOW

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:04.553
THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.022
DISTRIBUTED. IT'S GOING TO BE

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:07.923
DIFFICULT FOR US TO COME UP

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.292
WITH A SINGLE PICTURE OF HOW

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:11.760
THAT IT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED BUT

01:12:11.827 --> 01:12:13.462
THAT'S THAT'S MY IN AND THERE'S

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.963
A REPORT IN YOUR PACKET THAT IS

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.632
THAT REPORT ON THE TRIAGE FUNDS

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:19.501
AND- I THINK WE'VE SATISFIED

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:20.102
THE AUDITOR THAT. WE'VE MOVED

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.072
IN THAT DIRECTION. HAPPY TO

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:24.339
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND GET

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:25.240
INTO THE DETAIL OF WHY WE CAN'T

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.576
TELL YOU THE UPDATE. IN TERMS

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:28.911

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:30.512
ARE IT BUT I'M ALSO WOULD JUST

01:12:30.579 --> 01:12:31.080

WE DIVE INTO THAT. AS YOU SAID

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.121
PEOPLE KNOW THE PEOPLE OF

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.656
CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WHEN I

01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:42.191
BELIEVE THEY WANT TO THINK THAT

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:44.660
WE ARE SPENDING THIS MONEY.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.662
SMARTLY I'M PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:49.131
WORKING SO WELL MAKING SURE THE

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.766
MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING SPENT

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.000
CURLY ENTER IMPORTANT FIRST

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.669
STEP. RIGHT ARE YOU SPENDING

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.671
THE MONEY IS NOT THE HARD PART.

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:58.707
IT'S GETTING RESULTS SO WHAT

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:02.044
ARE WE DOING EITHER YOUR

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:03.679
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE OR OR SOME

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:06.181
OTHER BODY. HOW ARE WE TRACKING

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:08.484
OUTCOMES AND HOW ARE WE

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.819
IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:15.424
RIGHT ONE OF THE QUESTION. LET

SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AND WHAT

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.624
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ANALYZE

DATA SYSTEMS HAS A VERY

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.531
EXPENSIVE WE'RE REALLY TRYING

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:30.999
TO DO IS TAKE EXISTING

SERVICES WITH DATA FROM THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO LOOK

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.108
AT CRIMINAL JUSTICE RATES AND

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:42.644
WE'RE NOW WORKING TO UNDERSTAND

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.479
THE SERVICE DELIVERY SO IT'S

01:14:44.546 --> 01:14:46.215
NOT CHEST WHO'S IN THIS YOU

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:47.049
KNOW WHO IS IN A COMMITMENT A

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.851
WHOLE SYSTEM NOW WHO'S IN JAIL

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:49.852
WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:50.719
HAPPENED IN THE COMMUNITY

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.120
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND WHICH

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:56.124
OF THOSE INTERVENTIONS HAD AN

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:56.758
OUTCOME. OF AVOIDING JAIL RIGHT

01:14:56.825 --> 01:15:00.262
WE'RE NOT THERE YET. I I'LL

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:01.396
SHARE WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.966
COMMON PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.535
IN TWO THOUSAND AND- SIMPLY TWO

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:08.036
THOUSAND AND TWO. I WAS

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.838
INVOLVED WITH THE DRAFTING THE

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:10.739
LEGISLATION TO CREATE

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.274
CALIFORNIA'S COUNSELING MILLION

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.141
OFFENDERS WHICH IS NOW THE

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.509
COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.712
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND WE AND

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:17.846
LIST I WAS OF LITTLE WHO WERE

01:15:17.913 --> 01:15:19.047
AT THE TIME WE ENLISTED UC

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.049
BERKELEY TO DO THAT DATALINK.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.517
AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WE

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:24.519
PUBLISHED THAT IT IS FEASIBLE

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:25.387
TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT YOUR MENTAL

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:26.788
HEALTH DATA. IN OUR CRIMINAL

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.557
JUSTICE DATA AND UNDERSTAND

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.225
WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES DIVERT

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.595
PEOPLE TO PREVENT. TYPICALLY RE

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:34.463
INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:37.232
WORKING WITH THE POPULATION

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:37.866
THAT IS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.902
SYSTEM INITIALLY. TEN YEARS

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.069
LATER THE COMMISSION IS NOW

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:41.603
DOING THIS AGAIN TRYING TO

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:45.741
STAND THAT UP. WE ARE WORKING

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.276
TO LINK MENTAL HEALTH DATA TO

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.810
EMPLOYMENT DATA. THE

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:49.845
LEGISLATURE GAVE US THE

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.446
AUTHORITY TO WORK WITH EDT TO

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:52.948
ACCESS EMPLOYMENT DATA BECAUSE

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:54.650
REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT AS ONE OF

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.718
THE GOALS OF THE PREVENTION AND

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.053
EARLY INTERVENTION LANGUAGE OF

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.821
THE ACT. WE ARE SITTING DOWN

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:00.722
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.624
EDUCATION TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.059
CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

01:16:04.126 --> 01:16:05.394
INTERSECTION OF COMMUNITY

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.030
MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR SCHOOLS

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.465
AND DESIGN PARTNERSHIPS. TO

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.434
MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT ALSO LOOK

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.036
AT THE DATA ACROSS THE SYSTEM'S

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.771
VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEIR

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:17.105
DATA IS PROTECTED UNDER CERTAIN

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:19.207
FEDERAL RULES THE MEN HOT THAT

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.275
AFFECTS UNDER SEPARATE FEDERAL

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.177
RULES THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.145
THEY'RE OPEN THEIR WORKING WITH

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:26.248
US WERE ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:26.815
WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.017
WITH CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:29.618
HOMELESSNESS IS MORE DIFFICULT

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:30.552
WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:31.253
ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASE THAT

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:31.820
HAS IDENTIFIERS THAT YOU CAN

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.690
LINK. BUT DURING THE DAY TO

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.225
WORK IS JUST THE FIRST PIECE IT

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:37.826
MEANS WE ARE GOING TO IDENTIFY

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:41.163
CHALLENGES. AND IN NEW YOU TAKE

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:42.597
OFF THE CHALLENGES WE WANT TO

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:44.466
GET MUCH MORE GRANULAR INTO

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.068
WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE AT

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:49.204
THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. WE THEN

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:50.205
WANT TO BE ABLE TO COME ALONG

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:51.406
AND SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT SAID

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:54.876
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY. MOVING

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:57.212
COUNTIES TOWARDS BEST PRACTICES

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.314
AND FOR US THAT MEANS THE STATE

01:16:59.381 --> 01:16:59.982
NEEDS TO PUT IN PLACE A

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.084
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:04.553
WHICH S NOT AS ROBUST AS IT

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:06.955
COULD BE TODAY. WHICH MEANS THE

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.790
STATE NEEDS TO DEVELOP

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:09.358
OPPORTUNITIES TO INCENTIVIZE

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:13.328
COUNTIES. LAST YEAR WE RECEIVED

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:14.463
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS O SUPPORT

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:14.930
WHAT WE'RE CALLING IN

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:17.833
INNOVATION INCUBATOR. RATHER

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.836
THAN IN ESSENCE SIGN THE CHECK

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:21.737
FOR A PLAN THAT THE COUNTY

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.739
WROTE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:24.673
WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.340
STRENGTHEN THE INNOVATION

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.642
COMPONENT WE WANT TO USE THE

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.011
DATA TO IDENTIFY KEY

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.579
OPPORTUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.547
IMPROVED. AND THEN BRING PEOPLE

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:34.683
TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.451
COULD USE INNOVATION DOLLARS TO

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.953
STRENGTHEN CORE PROGRAMMING TO

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.955
MEET THOSE GOALS THE INTENT IS

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.089
NOT FOR THE COMMISSION TO TELL

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.791
THE COUNTIES WHAT TO FUND THE

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:45.193
INTENT IS TO SUPPORT BRINGING

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.428
COUNTIES TOGETHER WHO HAVE

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.496
SHARED CHALLENGES WHERE

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.564
WEAKENED SUBSIDIZE THAT CROSS

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.466
COUNTY CONVERSATION. THAT IS

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.268
MUCH EASIER THAN HALF ASKING

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:55.337
EACH COUNTY TO WRITE A CHECK

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:57.139
FOR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO YOU

01:17:57.205 --> 01:17:57.739
CAN GET PEOPLE IN A ROOM. THEY

01:17:57.806 --> 01:18:01.009
CAN'T SUBSIDIZE EACH OTHER. WE

01:18:01.076 --> 01:18:02.444
WERE ABLE TO TAKE TWO AND A

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.079
HALF MILLION DOLLARS. IN OUR

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:06.014
BUDGET LAST YEAR TO LAUNCH

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.015
THREE COLLABORATIVE INNOVATION

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.651
PROJECTS. ONE IS FOCUSING ON

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:10.852
STRENGTHENING FULL SERVICE

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.287
PARTNERSHIPS WHICH ARE THE

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.455
HIGHEST LEVEL OF COMMUNITY

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:14.956
BASED CARE. AND OUR DATA

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:17.159
SHOWING THAT ABOUT 40% OF

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.026
PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THIS

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.995
PROGRAMS ARE NOT MEETING GOALS.

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:22.264
THE COUNTIES ARE CO INVESTING

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:22.931
WITH US THEY'VE RACED

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:24.066
PHILANTHROPY PHILANTHROPIC

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:25.801
DOLLARS AS WELL WE HAVE

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.102
EIGHTEEN COUNTIES COMING

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.270
TOGETHER TO LEARN. HOW TO

01:18:28.336 --> 01:18:30.072
BETTER ANALYZE THEIR OWN DATA

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:30.906
HOW TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

01:18:30.972 --> 01:18:32.174
CONTRACTING WITH THEIR

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.875
COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND HOW TO

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.444
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.445
STRENGTH THAT TO ACHIEVE THE

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:39.014
OUTCOMES OF THAT LAW. WE HAVE A

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.849
GROUP OF FIVE COUNTIES WORKING

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:42.217
TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN CRIMINAL

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.552
JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH DATA

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.387
ALONG. THE LINES OF WHAT WE

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:46.354
HAVE DONE THEY HAVE MUCH MORE

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:48.356
DETAILED DATA. AND WE HAVE A

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:50.258
MULTI COUNTY PROJECT TO USE

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:52.327
PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.729
AS A WAY TO AVOID THE NEED FOR

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.164
LAW ENFORCEMENT BASED CRISIS

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:59.301
CARE. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO

01:18:59.367 --> 01:18:59.935
AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS THIS

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:01.336
YEAR WILL ENGAGE THE COUNTIES.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.471
THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE

01:19:02.537 --> 01:19:05.107
RECEIVED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:19:05.173 --> 01:19:08.844
REALLY THAT WAS FOR. WE ARE

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:09.444
REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON CRIMINAL

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.245
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. WE SEE

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:11.813
THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.148
STATE TO FACILITATE HOW

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.550
COUNTIES CAN LEARN TOGETHER AND

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:17.953
IMPROVE THEIR SYSTEMS WITHOUT

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:19.521
ACTUALLY DIRECTING THEM SAID

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.290
BEYOND THAT THAT THE LOCAL

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.558
PRIORITIES THAT ARE THAT. THE

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.927
VISION OF REALIGNMENT THE THIRD

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:28.730
PIECE IS INCENTIVES AND SO MANY

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:29.965
OF THE FUNDS THAT YOU PROVIDED

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.199
US THIS YEAR ON THE SCHOOL

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.334
MENTAL THESE DIDN'T KNOW HOW

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.137
SERVICES ACT EARLY PSYCHOSIS

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.772
FUNDS AND YOUTH DROP IN CENTERS

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:40.242
PLUS THE DATA ARE WHAT WE VIEW

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:41.943
AS INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:42.978
COUNTIES TO ROLL UP THEIR

01:19:43.044 --> 01:19:44.980
SLEEVES IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.214
ABOUT HOW RESPONSIVE THE

01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:49.084
COUNTIES HAVE BEEN. WE'VE HAD A

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.652
TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:51.820
COUNTIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.421
WHO HAVE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.624
THAT WE BOTH RECOGNIZE HOW

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.459
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:58.760
ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE ALL

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.863
EXPECT OF THEM. AND THAT THE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.198
KIND OF PARTNERSHIP THAT WERE

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:07.102
ENVISIONING WITH STATE IS VERY

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:09.538
WELCOME IN PART BECAUSE ALL ALL

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.006
QUOTE THE NORTH COUNTIES THAT

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.941
SAID THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.043
CONSULTANTS THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.144
BAND WITH OR THE TIME OF THE

01:20:16.211 --> 01:20:19.881
STAFF. TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:24.119
ANALYZE THE DATA. EXPLORE THE

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:24.786
WORLD TO LOOK FOR BEST

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:25.587
PRACTICES AND THEN TO FIND THE

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.087
FOLKS WHO CAN HELP THEM

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.323
IMPLEMENT THEM. AND IF WE CAN

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.691
OPEN SOME OF THOSE DOORS FOR

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.760
THEM OR SUPPORT THEIR PEER

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:33.795
COUNTIES TO DO THAT THEN THEY

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:34.396
CAN BENEFIT AND OTHER COUNTIES

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:38.099
LIKE THAT CAN BENEFIT. SO IN

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:39.534
THAT'S OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.504
BROAD STRATEGY REALLY IS THE

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:43.838
DATA AND THEN SUPPORT SUPPORT

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:46.508
SUPPORT SUPPORT. I THINK WE'VE

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:47.342
GOT SOME OTHER QUESTIONS AT

LACKING DATA AND THAT IS A HUGE

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:07.095
HUGE CHALLAN SO FOR ME. IN THE

01:21:07.162 --> 01:21:09.431

DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S ANY

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.515
WAY TO DETERMINE. HOW THIS

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:29.517
MONEY WAS SPENT ON THE PROGRAM

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.586

FIGURE THIS OUT IS ALMOST

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:56.945
IMPOSSIBLE SO. ONE QUESTION IS

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:58.046
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED SORT OF

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.148
REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE'S WARS

01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.483
WERE SMALLER GROUPS A COUNTIES

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:04.119
COULD ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER TO

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:04.719
FIGURE FIGURE SOME OF THIS OUT

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:08.857
BECAUSE. YOU KNOW CLEARLY

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:09.424
TRINITY COUNTY IN A TRAINING

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.593
COUNTY IS NOT LA. NOT EVEN

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.694
CLOSE THE MAIN AND SO THE

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:15.697
CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT AND SO

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.232
THE ONE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.000
APPROACH IS ARE JUST A DISASTER

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:21.603
FOR SMALLER COUNTIES SO HAVE

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:22.537

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:24.539
REGIONAL REGIONAL

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:25.106
COLLABORATIVE'S WERE YOU CAN

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:27.575
BRING COUNTIES TOGETHER. THAT

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:28.276
CAN LEARN NOT LEARN TOGETHER

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.679
LEARN FROM THAT ABSOLUTELY AND

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.547

COMMENT ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION

01:22:34.015 --> 01:22:36.418
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND WHAT'S

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:39.587
BEEN THE ANTENNA BUT RIGHT. SO.

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:40.221
ON THE FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOLD

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.523
WE HAVE ONLINE RIGHT NOW YOU

ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND THE

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.129
INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THE WET

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:48.863
FUNDS ARE NOT BROKEN OUT BUT

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.298
THE S. S. P. E. I'D INVASION

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.700
ARE BROKEN OUT AND YOU COULD

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:52.667
SEE. HOW MUCH MONEY THEY

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.669
RECEIVED WHAT THEY SPENT AND

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:55.270
WHAT THEY HAD LEFT IN THAT

01:22:55.337 --> 01:22:56.838
ACCOUNT AT THE END OF THE

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.239
FISCAL YEAR AND THERE'S A

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.875
CUMULATIVE TOTAL OKAY SO WEIRD.

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.911
SOYES WE WANT TO GET THERE

01:23:02.977 --> 01:23:03.745
THAT IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:06.414
OF UPDATING THAT THAT THE RULES

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:08.016
AROUND HOW COUNTIES REPORT

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:09.250
THOSE DOLLARS THAT WHOLE

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.319
PROCESS HAVE CHANGED FROM LAST

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.722
YEAR TO THIS YEAR. AND SO

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:15.290
ALTHOUGH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:16.825
FIGURES ARE AVAILABLE THEY WERE

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:17.892
CáC THAT UNDER A DIFFERENT

01:23:17.959 --> 01:23:19.761
METHODOLOGY. AND SO THE

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.530
HISTORICAL BASE TO CALCULATE

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:25.066
THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FUND HAS

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:25.667
CHANGED. AND SO WE ARE WE HAVE

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:29.971
NOT. PUT THAT INFORMATION

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:30.905
ONLINE BECAUSE WE SORT OF DONE

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:31.840
APPLES FOR TEN YEARS AND

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.041
THERE'S AN ORANGE NOW. AND WE

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.610
WANT TO IN AND WE'RE CONCERNED

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.111
THAT THE RELIABILITY AND

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.380
VALIDITY OF THAT. WE'RE JUST

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.081
NOT THERE YET. IN ADDITION TO

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.083
THAT OF THE PROGRAM REPORTING

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.719
TOOL AND THERE'S A HAND OUT IN

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:45.987
HERE ON YOUR WEBSITE ON OUR

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.990
WEBSITE. IT ACTUALLY ALLOWS YOU

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:51.893
TO DO A SEARCH OF THIS IS BASED

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.061
ON THE COUNTY THREE YEAR PLANS.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:56.564
THERE ARE. A COUPLE THOUSAND

01:23:56.631 --> 01:23:57.999
PROGRAMS IN THERE AND IT IS A

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:00.168
PLAN IT'S NOT WHAT THEY DID IT

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.236
SORT OF HOW THEY'RE MOVING

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.303
FORWARD MANY THOSE PROGRAMS ARE

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.939
HISTORICAL PROGRAMS OVER TIME.

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:08.676
THIS WILL BE. EXPANDED ITS

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:09.144
COUNTIES GIVE US MORE

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:11.746
INFORMATION THERE IS IN HERE.

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:12.647
SPACE AT LEAST AND WHILE THE

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.183
DATA COMES IN FOR A DESCRIPTION

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.684
OF THE PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:18.353
FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.721
WHERE REPORTING ON WHO YOU'VE

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.222
SERVE WOULD BE ADDED AND SO THE

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:22.557
IDEA IS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:25.193
WHICH PROGRAMS SERVE VETERANS

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.261
IN YOUR COUNTY YOU CAN CLICK

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.263
ON. YOUR COUNTY TYPE IN

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:30.565
VETERANS IT'LL TELL YOU YOUR

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:31.900
BILL TO TELL HOW MUCH FUNDS

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.101
WENT TO A PROGRAM YOU KNOW

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:34.536
VETERANS AN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.104
BUT THERE WAS A PROGRAM THAT

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:37.338
WAS TARGETED. TOWARDS VETERANS

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:39.073
YOU COULD FIND IT SO WE

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.909
ABSOLUTELY ARE WORKING TO

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:43.278
INCLUDE THE BUDGET INFORMATION.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:46.581
I WILL ADD THAT AS THE LA SO

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:49.184
ELOQUENTLY POINTED ME TO SAY IS

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:53.655
2225% HAVE A COUNTY SPENDING.

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:54.622
WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE OTHER

01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:58.359
7580% OF THE DOLLARS. OUR HOPE

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.561
IS THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.795
COUNTY SENATE ARMED HEALTHCARE

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:02.864
SERVICES THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

AND THEN A FULLER AND OUTCOMES.

01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:13.141
TO GET THERE ON THE OUTCOMES

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.143
PACE WE ABSOLUTELY ARE

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:15.810
ENCOURAGING REGIONAL

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:18.213
APPROACHES. IN SOME TYPICALLY

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:19.781
WHAT WE DO IS WE SAY HEY WHO'S

COUNTIES ARE CO LOCATED AND IT

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:24.419
IS A REGIONAL IN THE

01:25:24.486 --> 01:25:26.254
TRADITIONAL SENSE THAT I THINK

IS WHO'S INTERESTED AND WE

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:39.434
REALLY TRY TO WORK WHERE THERE

WAY AND SO IT IS A ACROSS

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:56.417
COUNTY COLLABORATIVE BUT

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.753
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT HAND PICKING.

TRADITIONAL GEOGRAPHIC. AT TERM

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:07.695

CROSS COUNTY ENGAGEMENT. AS WE

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:13.701
WANT TO AVOID WHAT I MIGHT CALL

MENDOCINO DOING SOMETHING

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.373
PHENOMENAL AND NO ONE ELSE

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.808
TRIES BECAUSE IT'S THE WATER OR

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.911
THE CLEAN AIR OR YOU KNOW SORT

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.712
OF THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY.

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:26.614
AND THAT BEST PRACTICE NEVER

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:27.148
EXTENDS BEYOND THE COUNTY

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:30.618
BORDER. WE ASK THAT THERE BE AT

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:33.888
LEAST TWO OR THREE IDEALLY FIVE

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:34.422
TO EIGHT COUNTY THAT ARE

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:35.757
PARTICIPATING IN THESE

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:36.324
COLLABORATIVE'S THE IDEA IS

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:39.460
THAT IF IT WORKS. IT'S EASIER

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.962
TO GET TO THAT TIPPING POINT OF

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.430
EVERYBODY PICKING IT UP BECAUSE

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:45.166
IT WAS DONE IN LA AND INFINITY.

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:47.468
THE OTHER REASON WE DO IT IS WE

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:49.337
WANT THE STATE TO BE RESPONSIVE

01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.738
WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE TELLING

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.173
US IS THAT INNOVATION ISN'T

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.841
JUST ABOUT COUNTIES CHANGING

01:26:53.908 --> 01:26:55.777
THEIR BEHAVIOR IT ALSO MUST

01:26:55.843 --> 01:26:57.378
INCLUDE THE STATE CHANGING ITS

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.781
BEHAVIOR. AND SO IF WE CAN HAVE

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.716
A CRITICAL MASS OF COUNTIES. WE

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:03.518
BELIEVE IF THEY'RE COMING TO

01:27:03.585 --> 01:27:05.787
THE STATE ASKING FOR REFINEMENT

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.622
OF A REGULATION OR RULE OR A

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.524
STATUTE THAT THE STATE WILL BE

01:27:09.591 --> 01:27:11.492
MORE RESPONSIVE TO THAT REQUEST

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:12.594
IF IT'S EIGHT COUNTIES THEN IF

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.363
IT'S TRINITY ALONE. AND SO VERY

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:18.633
MUCH CHAIRMAN WOULD WE ARE

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.602
WORKING TO CREATE THOSE

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:23.104
COLLABORATIVE'S. THANK YOU. CUT

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:26.708
ONE FINAL QUESTION. SO TWO

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:27.275
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:28.676
REALIGNMENT MONEY. IS THIS

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:33.181
WORKING. I MEAN THAT'S A TOUGH

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:36.050
QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS BUT. HOW

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:38.353
MUCH DID WE SEE THAT A SPEND.

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:41.756
AS A STATE BEFORE. IS THE MONEY

01:27:41.823 --> 01:27:44.158
IS AT COMPARABLE. AND DO

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:49.831
COUNTIES HAVE. THE TOOLS. F. AT

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:50.965
THE BILL'S LIKE INDIVIDUAL

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:52.667
COUNTIES DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:53.201
THAT THE STATE HAD BEFORE

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:58.673
REALIGNMENT. SO. I HEAR ALL THE

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.742
TIME REALIGNMENTS KILLING US

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:02.910
WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING YOU KNOW

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:03.378
AND IT'S A VARIETY OF

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.979
DIFFERENT. THINGS RIGHT. IT'S A

01:28:05.046 --> 01:28:08.182
TOUGH QUESTION. IS IT WORKING

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.183
TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:13.721
A LOT OF MONEY. I APPRECIATE

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:14.856
YOU SAVING THE EASY QUESTION

01:28:14.922 --> 01:28:18.960
FOR THE LA OUT. HER I'M OF THE

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.595
ANYBODY WANTS IT TO CRACK IT

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:23.898
YOU KNOW SO I I'LL SAY A COUPLE

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:27.835
OF THINGS. I'M YES AND NOW

01:28:27.902 --> 01:28:28.436
RIGHT I MEAN YOU KNOW THE NO

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:31.105
ANSWER DO YOU OPENED RIGHT. AT

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:33.274
THE SAME TIME WE SEE INCREDIBLE

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.276
STRENGTH IN WHAT COUNTIES HAVE

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.477
BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:37.645
FLEXIBILITY IN THE STRUCTURE

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.547
REALIGNMENT I THINK OUR

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:42.684
ARGUMENT IS THAT WITHIN THE

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.218
DESIGN OF REALIGNMENT THIS

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:45.853
SYSTEM CAN WORK MUCH MUCH

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.056
BETTER THAN IS WORKING TODAY

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:51.492
WHAT'S MISSING IS THE STRATEGY

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:53.528
TO ACTUALLY GO FROM HERE'S THE

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:57.031
DOLLARS GO DO GOOD WORK TO WHAT

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.032
WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET DONE

01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:00.601
WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY ON THAT.

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.904
YOU KNOW IN MY OUT REACH AND

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.205
SPEAKING I OFTEN WILL COMMENT

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.740
THAT I WAS THE LOOK TO WHAT'S

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:07.442
HAPPENING WITH MEASLES BECAUSE

01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:09.043
IT IS A CURRENT ISSUE IN

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:10.812
CALIFORNIA IN THAT WE HAVE A

01:29:10.878 --> 01:29:12.780
VERY CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT WE ARE

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.348
TRYING TO GET DONE IN TERMS OF

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.384
IMMUNIZATIONS AGAINST MEASLES

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:18.886
WE KNOW WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:19.487
WE KNOW THE STRATEGIES USED TO

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:23.157
FILL THOSE GAPS. AND IN THE

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:23.991
MEASLES CONVERSATION. OUR

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.059
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS DON'T

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:25.626
SAY MY JOB IS TO GET MEASLES

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:28.329
SHOT FOR PEOPLE ON MEDICARE AL.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.197
THEY SAY IF WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:31.332
SUCCESSFUL. MY JOB IS TO MAKE

01:29:31.399 --> 01:29:33.468
SURE THAT EVERY CHILD EVERY

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.169
ADULT WHO CAN RECEIVE THE

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:37.338
VACCINE RECEIVE THE VACCINE

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:38.439
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING

01:29:38.506 --> 01:29:40.208
TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. WE DON'T

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.210
HAVE COMPARABLE GOALS IN MENTAL

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:44.712
HEALTH WE DON'T HAVE AGREEMENT

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:46.948
ON WHAT IT IS WE ARE TRYING TO

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:47.515
GET DONE MY EARLIER COMMENTS

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:50.518
ABOUT PREVENTION. THERE'S ABOUT

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.452
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:52.987
YEAR DEDICATED TO PREVENTION

01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:54.922
EARLY INTERVENTION WE DON'T YET

01:29:54.989 --> 01:29:56.557
HAVE AGREEMENT ON WHAT THAT

01:29:56.624 --> 01:29:58.593
MEANS IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:00.294
I WAS TALKING TODAY YESTERDAY.

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.497
WITH WE HAVE A FORENSIC

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.031
PSYCHIATRIST WHO IS ACTUALLY IN

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.600
THE ROOM BACK HERE HIS SPENDING

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:07.368
SOME TIME WITH US AS A POLICY

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.036
FELLOW. AND WE WERE TALKING

01:30:09.103 --> 01:30:10.438
ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT IS

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:12.607
AVAILABLE FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:13.708
IN THAT FIELD AROUND PREVENTION

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.443
MENTAL IN IN TERMS OF

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:18.479
PREVENTING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:30:18.546 --> 01:30:19.113
AND IT'S THAT'S RIGHT THERE YOU

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.850
GO RIGHT. IT'S NOT HAPPENING

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:26.420
SO. I THINK. THE PROBLEM ISN'T.

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:27.789
REALIGNMENT I MEAN I THINK IF

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:28.923
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:31.025
REVISIT THAT ABSOLUTELY THERE

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:31.659
ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD PROBABLY

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:34.362
STRENGTH AND THAT. FROM OUR

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:37.665
PERSPECTIVE. WITHIN THE CONTEXT

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.967
HOW TO CONSTRUCT OF REALIGNMENT

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.970
WE HAVE NOT REALLY ESTABLISHED

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.540
AGREED GOALS FOR MENTAL HEALTH

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.341
MENTAL HEALTH CARE. WE AREN'T

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:48.943
LEVERAGING THE DATA WE HAVE IT

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.745
IS VERY DIFFICULT IT TAKES US

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:52.547
SOMETIMES TWO TO THREE YEARS TO

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:53.948
NEGOTIATE A DATA USE AGREEMENT

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.449
WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:56.551
LOOK AT THEIR DATA. AND THEN

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.219
WHEN WE DO LOOK AT THEIR DATA

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.321
AND WE FIND THESE CHALLENGES WE

01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.790
THAN WE THAN SAY OR THE

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:06.194
COUNTIES SAY. NOW WHAT. AND THE

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.262
TOOLS WE HAVE ARE VERY LIMITED.

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:11.232
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WHAT WE-

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:12.900
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON IS

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.335
STRENGTH IN THIS STRENGTHENING

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.003
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THOSE TOOLS

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:18.272
AND THE STRATEGIES SO THAT SO

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:19.307
THAT COUNTIES HAVE A CLEAR

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:22.109
SENSE. OF HOW TO GET TO THE

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:30.151
GOALS THAT ARE AGREED UPON.

01:31:30.218 --> 01:31:30.751
ANOTHER QUESTION THE LA ONCE A

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.854
CRACK ABOUT. DID YOU HAVE

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.623
ANYTHING TO ADD. NOT NOT NOT

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:36.457
ALLOWED TO ADD A I THINK IT'S

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:37.558
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT LOCAL

01:31:37.625 --> 01:31:38.893
FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTATION IN

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.861
THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.229
ACROSS PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:42.463
OPERATE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:43.497
IMPORTANT FEATURES A

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.499
REALIGNMENT GIVEN THE SIZE AND

01:31:45.566 --> 01:31:46.701
VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.903
EXIST IN THE STATE. SO THERE

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:49.503
DEFINITELY ARE BENEFITS THAT

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.639
ARE THAT ARE IN THAT SYSTEM AT

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.107
THE SAME TIME AS IT'S BEEN

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:55.142
NOTED ON A COUPLE OF PLACES SO

01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:57.745
FAR TODAY AND THERE IS A NEED

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.013
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.282
PROVIDING THAT GUIDANCE. AND

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.717
ADDITIONALLY ONE ASPECT A

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.185
REALIGNMENT THAT PERHAPS HASN'T

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.720
BEEN FULLY REALIZED IS LOOKING

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:07.855
AT OUTCOMES AND THAT OBVIOUSLY

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.223
IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THING

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:10.992
TO DO BUT A LOT COULD BE DONE

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.361
TO INCREASE THE REPORTING OF

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:15.963
INFORMATION UP TO THE STATE

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.597
LEVEL TO REALLY ASSESS. WHETHER

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:21.636
IT'S WORKING OR NOT. AND I AND

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:22.703
I WOULD THAT LOOK AT THAT THE

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:23.471
IDEA OF THE QUESTION WAS NOT.

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:24.105
THIS IS HER TO THROW A BOMB YOU

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:27.074
ANSWERED. WHAT I WAS LOOKING

01:32:27.141 --> 01:32:27.708
FOR AND I APPRECIATE THAT BOTH

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:28.309
OF YOU ANSWER WEB LOOKING FOR.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:28.876
LIKE A LOT OF COUNTIES HAVE

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:30.845
FELT. OVERWHELMED BY THE

01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.613
RESPONSIBILITY THEY NOW HAVE

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.081
AND SO. THE TECHNICAL

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.983
ASSISTANCE PART OF THAT BECOMES

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:37.885
A REAL CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY FOR

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:38.753
SMALLER CAN EVEN THE LARGER

01:32:38.819 --> 01:32:41.222
COUNTIES BECAUSE- NOW. YOU HAVE

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:43.124
THE RESOURCES AND NOW YOU HAVE

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.259
THE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I THINK

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:47.495
IT'S PRETTY OVERWHELMING AND

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:49.030
ABSOLUTELY WHEN YOU ADD ALL THE

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:50.898
OTHER THINGS IN THEIR LACK OF

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:52.633
WORK FORCE AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:57.471
FACTORS. IT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:58.873
CRIME AND WE'RE REALLY

01:32:58.940 --> 01:32:59.373
STRUGGLING. THANK YOU I

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:08.816
APPRECIATE THAT. BEING A LITTLE

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:10.184
TALKIE TODAY BUT THIS IS THE

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:11.152
JUST SUCH A HUGE ISSUE THAT I

01:33:11.218 --> 01:33:12.219
THINK INCOME VINCE'S MUCH MORE

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:13.287
AREAS THAN WE REALLY BELIEVE IT

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:15.022
DOES SO ALWAYS GLAD TO HEAR YOU

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:15.790
TALK ABOUT THE STUDENT

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:19.327
SERVICES. BUT I MY HOPE IS WITH

01:33:19.393 --> 01:33:21.429
THE STUDENT SERVICES DISCUSSION

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:23.597
IS THAT WE ENROLLED THE SCHOOL

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.066

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:27.435
SUPERINTENDENTS AND PRINCIPALS.

01:33:27.501 --> 01:33:30.037
TO REALLY START TO UNDERSTAND

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:31.639
THESE ISSUES FROM A VERY YOUNG

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:34.375
AGE. MUCH MORE THAN THEY DO AND

01:33:34.442 --> 01:33:36.477
AS WE SAY THAT WE HAVE ONE

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.779
INSTITUTION TALKING TO EACH

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:39.880
OTHER AND THEN OTHER STUFF THAT

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.716
DURING TALKS OF CRIMINAL.

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.117
JUSTICE TALKS TO CRIMINAL

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.019
JUSTICE YOU OF EDUCATORS

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.854
TALKING EDUCATORS MENTAL HEALTH

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.656
TALKING AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.124
CROSS DIALOGUE BUT THERE'S

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.826
THINGS THAT HAPPEN AND VERY

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:54.762
VERY YOUNG AGE FOR. CHILDREN

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:57.898
AND FAMILIES THAT AS YOU SAID

01:33:57.965 --> 01:34:00.368
ARE JUST NOT EVEN AND DRESSED

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:01.635
IN THE SCHOOLS AND MANY TIMES

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:03.838
SCHOOLS ARE WE'RE HERE FOR

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:06.073
EDUCATION ACADEMICS. NOT

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.142
REALIZING THAT IF YOU CAN WORK

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.076
ON THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:10.644
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:12.146
OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.815
ACADEMICALLY AND AS A TEACHER

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:16.517
FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS ALWAYS

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.052
I JUST DISTINCTIVELY REMEMBER

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.054
LOOKING AT. WELL FIRST GREATER

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.589
LOOKING UP AT ME AND HE HAD A

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:23.724
BIG ABSCESS IN HIS TOOTH SO

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:26.127
THAT'S ACTUALLY A HEALTH ISSUE

01:34:26.193 --> 01:34:27.661
BUT IF YOU CAN GET THAT TAKEN

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.330
CARE OF. THAT'S GOING TO GO A

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:31.832
LONG WAY TO. ADDRESS OTHER

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.534
ISSUES WHETHER IT BE EYE

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:35.369
GLASSES AND ALL OF THESE TYPE

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:37.538
OF THINGS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:49.050
THAT. WE HAVE A VERY PUNISHING.

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:49.884
KIND OF SOCIETY WHEN IT COMES

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:51.519
TO BEHAVIOR BY CHILDREN AND WE

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:52.720
JUST HAD A BILL YESTERDAY. I

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:53.721
BELIEVE ON THE FLOOR A FEW DAYS

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:55.656
AGO. ABOUT NOT EXPELLING OR

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:56.857
SUSPENDING KIDS UNDER FIVE I

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:59.593
THINK IT WAS AND- YOU KNOW THAT

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:00.694
WE EVEN GO THERE IN THE FIRST

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:01.295
PLACE FOR KID THAT ARE FOUR

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.496
AND FIVE. IT JUST SEEMS

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:03.097
OUTRAGEOUS I REACH FOR MY OWN

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.432
KIDS AND YOU KNOW ALONG WITH

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.933
ALL THE STUDENTS THAT I'VE HAD

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.002
AND YES YOU CAN GET FRUSTRATED

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.303
ALL BUT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.205
YOU CAN DO. BUT AGAIN I'D BE

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.174
HAPPY TO WORK AT SOME POINT

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.543
BECAUSE I MEAN KIDS GET BUT YOU

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:16.977
KNOW WHETHER IT'S SUSPENDED OR

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:18.212
THEY GO TO DETENTION ALL THESE

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:20.948
THINGS WE HEARD DECADES AGO

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:22.917
THEY'RE STILL DOING SO IF YOU.

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:23.884
IF YOU PUT A STUDENT AND

01:35:23.951 --> 01:35:25.419
DETENTION AND THEY'RE SITTING

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:27.188
THERE FOR AN HOUR OR WHATEVER

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.923
AMOUNT OF TIME. AND THEY'RE NOT

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.257
DOING ANYTHING HOW IS THAT

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.560
PRODUCTIVE SO ARE THERE WAYS TO

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.862
BRING IN UP. INNOVATIVE

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.131
PRACTICES WHETHER THEY BE YOGA

01:35:37.198 --> 01:35:41.569
OR OR VARIOUS TYPE OF

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:42.103
ACTIVITIES THAT YES THERE

01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:47.141
REMOVED. BUT THEY'RE NOT PUNISH

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:48.576
WHERE IT JUST BECOMES WELL WHY

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.177
DO I EVEN CARE I WORKED IN A-

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:51.745
JUNIOR HIGH WHERE I WAS DOING A

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:54.048
LUNCH PROGRAM AND IT WAS KIND

01:35:54.115 --> 01:35:54.815
OF DETENTION STUFF BUT I

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:55.749
THOUGHT I'M NOT GOING TO DO

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.751
THAT. I'M GONNA CREATE LIKE WE

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.987
CALLED IT A LUNCH BUNCH IN AND

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:01.455
BROUGHT IN SPEAKERS AND THINGS

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:04.058
LIKE THAT. AND I ASKED THE KIDS

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:06.460
WHO KINDA REPEATEDLY CAME.

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:08.062
WHICH THEY'RE USUALLY THE SAME

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:10.264
KIDS AND THE KIDS FROM

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.831
KINDERGARTEN AND THEY SAID I

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:15.970
DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW I SO WILL

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:16.804
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

01:36:16.871 --> 01:36:18.405
BUT I DON'T CARE WHY SHOULD

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:18.939
EVEN BE HERE BECAUSE THEY

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:21.942
ALREADY HAD. IN THEIR MINDS OF

01:36:22.009 --> 01:36:24.078
FELT THAT THEY WERE JUST NOT

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:26.614
CONNECTED NOT ENGAGED SO WITH

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:29.450
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AND I

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.618
SAY SUPERINTENDENTS AND

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:32.920
PRINCIPALS. BECAUSE YES YOU CAN

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.121
TALK TO THE TEACHERS BUT THE

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.689
PRINCIPALS AND SUPERINTENDENTS

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:36.991
ARE THE ONES THAT IMPLEMENT THE

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:39.727
POLICY. AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:42.663
SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO COME TO

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.266
CAMPUS AND TALK ABOUT SOME NEW

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:45.866
INNOVATION IF THEY CAN'T EVEN

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:50.437
GET IN THE DOOR. THERE IT IS

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:51.038
IT'S GOING TO GO NO WHERE AND

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:53.140
SO THOSE ARE SOME PARTNERSHIPS

01:36:53.207 --> 01:36:54.508
THAT I THINK THAT COULD BE

01:36:54.575 --> 01:36:57.011
REALLY HUGE TELEHEALTH I HAD A

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.446
BILL LAST YEAR. TO START TO SET

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:02.216
THE STAGE FOR TELEHEALTH IN

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:04.919
PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW I GOT SIGNED

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:06.520
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S-

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:07.888
ANYTHING IS HAPPENING SO THAT'S

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:11.091
ANOTHER. QUESTION BUT BECAUSE

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.493
OF ALL THE ACTIVE SHOOTING ALL

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:14.161
THESE TYPE OF THINGS STUDENTS A

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:16.230
LOT OF TIMES CAMPUSES WILL SAY

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:16.664
WELL WE'RE BRINGING

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.666
PROFESSIONALS ON THE CAMPUS

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.568
LIKE. THE DAY AFTER THE WEEK

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:23.604
AFTER AND YOU KNOW YOU MAY HAVE

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:26.373
TEN STUDENTS THAT GO MAYBE OF A

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.274
HUNDRED BUT IT'S IMMEDIATELY

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.443
AFTER. AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:30.811
OF THESE ISSUES THAT KIND OF

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:33.480
SUSTAIN FROM DRAMATIC EVENTS.

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.282
CAN SHOW UP SIX MONTHS LATER A

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.384
YEAR LATER SO THAT AYE

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:40.254
TELEHEALTH. THEY COULD IF THEY

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:41.021
FOR FEELING ANXIETY COULD GO

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:43.190
LOG IN AT SCHOOL. HAVE SOME

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:46.493
TYPE OF ADMINISTRATOR BUT THAT

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.061
YOU HAVE A TELE HEALTH PERSN

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:52.366
RIGHT THERE. SO I APPRECIATE

01:37:52.433 --> 01:37:55.769
THAT. LAST YEAR AT TWO YEARS

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:59.406
AGO THE COMMISSION. IT SHOULD

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:02.042
AN RFP TO SEE THAT USING SB

01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:03.544
EIGHTY TO TRIAGE FUNDS SAYING

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:05.412
THAT COUNTY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:06.013
TO THE FOR THESE FUNDS BUT YOU

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.015
HAVE TO HAVE A SCHOOL PARTNER.

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:09.950
AND ABOUT 30% ABOUT A THIRD OF

01:38:10.017 --> 01:38:11.051
THE COUNTIES RESPONDED I MEAN

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:11.685
MANY CALLED AND SAID THAT LOVE

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:12.486
TO DO THIS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.355
CAPACITY. I THINK THERE IS

01:38:14.421 --> 01:38:15.689
TREMENDOUS RECOGNITION ON THE

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:17.992
PART OF THE COUNTIES IN THE

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.326
SCHOOLS THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:21.195
THIS. THE CHALLENGE AND THINK

01:38:21.262 --> 01:38:22.930
THIS GETS BACK TO THE QUESTION

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:26.300
THAT THAT WITH RAISED EARLIER

01:38:26.367 --> 01:38:28.402
THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES ALL

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:29.036
AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:38:29.103 --> 01:38:31.071
BUT THEY'RE IN POCKETS. RIGHT

01:38:31.138 --> 01:38:32.940
THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT HAVE

01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:33.474
BEEN PARTNERING WITH THEIR

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:34.008
SCHOOLS ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:36.610
YEARS. THEY THROUGH PREVENTION

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:39.179
AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES I

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.282
HAVE YET TO TALK TO A COUNTY

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.083
HIS RAISED AN ISSUE WHERE WE

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:43.951
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND

01:38:44.018 --> 01:38:46.553
SOMEONE WHO HAS THOUGHT ABOUT

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.656
THAT SAME ISSUE OVER TIME AND

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.157
IS AND IS EITHER DOING

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.059
SOMETHING NOW THAT THEY FIND TO

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:53.560
BE VERY EFFECTIVE OR IS TRYING

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.629
SOMETHING NOW. SO WE SEE THIS

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.364
TREMENDOUS WILLINGNESS IT'S

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.566
JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:02.503
THOSE PRACTICES OUT OF THE YOU

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.905
KNOW THE BOUTIQUE BOX RIGHT

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:06.507
THAT THE MENDOCINO MIRACLE AND

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:08.776
SPREAD THEM AND IT'S VERY

01:39:08.842 --> 01:39:10.144
DIFFICULT TO DO THAT SORT OF

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:11.245
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:12.946
ANALYSIS OF IS IT ACTUALLY

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:15.215
WORKING AND WHY DOES IT WORK.

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:18.819
AND TO DO THAT IN A WAY. THAT

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:19.753
WITHIN SHAPE THE OTHER COUNTIES

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.287
BUT WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:23.891
BECAUSE THERE'S- A RICHNESS OF.

01:39:23.957 --> 01:39:26.026
LEADERSHIP AT THE COUNTY LEVEL

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:27.594
AND IN OUR STATE AGENCIES

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.730
THERE'S A RICHNESS OF RESOURCES

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:30.764
AS YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:39:30.831 --> 01:39:33.967
THE M. HSA. AND TODAY MORE THAN

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:37.204
EVER BEFORE THERE'S A RENEWED

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:37.771
COMMITMENT TO TACKLE SOME OF

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:40.941
THESE CHALLENGES. IT'S NOT EASY

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:41.942
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY VERY

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.544
DIFFICULT MOSTLY FOR

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:46.046
LONGSTANDING CULTURAL ISSUES OF

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:49.249
WE DON'T TO DO THIS AND THEN

01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:50.017
THESE OTHER ISSUES LIKE

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:51.852
INADEQUATE WORK FORCE BARRIERS

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:56.256
TO ACCESSING DATA. NO DOLLARS

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:57.758
FOR TA OR VERY LIMITED TO I

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.026
SHOULD SAY VERY LIMITED DOLLARS

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.161
FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT I

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:03.430
THINK CALIFORNIA HAS THE

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.031
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ALL OF

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:07.835
THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU AND I

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:08.469
THINK BEFORE WE SELECTED FOR A

01:40:08.535 --> 01:40:10.771
MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:11.338

HSA EITHER WORKING OR IS IT IS

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.792
IT WORKING WELL I THINK WHAT WE

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:33.994
WOULD SAY AND WHAT WE STRONGLY

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:35.862
BELIEVE IS THAT IT. UNLIKE

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.330
OTHER STATES IS ONE OF THE MOST

01:45:37.397 --> 01:45:39.566
UNIQUE. PARTS ABOUT CALIFORNIA

FUNDS. SO WITH THE AUDIT THERE

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:36.289
WERE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS

01:46:36.356 --> 01:46:37.357
THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT WE

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:38.291

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.417
FRAME THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE TO

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:40.787
SPEND THOSE FUNDS AND SO WANTED

HAVE STARTED REVERTING FUNDS

01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:54.768
THAT WERE NOT SPENT OR DID NOT

01:47:54.835 --> 01:47:56.469
HAVE A PLAN BY THE COUNTIES TO

01:47:56.536 --> 01:48:02.042
SPEND THOSE BY JULY FIRST. DATE

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:06.046

DOLLARS AND REFLECT UNSPENT. IN

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:11.818

THINK THE LOWEST IN THE ROAD

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:19.826
AND THE RECESSION WAS SOMEWHERE

01:48:19.893 --> 01:48:21.528
IN THE SEVEN TO EIGHT HUNDRED

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:22.863
MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN NOW

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.731
YOU AS WE NOTED WERE UP OVER

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:25.232
TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN

01:48:25.298 --> 01:48:28.768
REVENUES. WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:29.870
REVERSION NOTICES TO THE

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:32.038
COUNTIES THAT'S APPROXIMATELY

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:34.241
EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:35.308
FOR COUNTIES WITH A POPULATION

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:37.277
OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:38.411
OR MORE THAT HAVEN'T SPENT THE

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:39.679
MONEY AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:42.115
REVERSION AND SO. YOU KNOW

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.383
AGAIN THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:44.517
HAS BEEN BOTH REPORTED IN

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:46.553
REALLOCATED TO THE COUNTIES IS

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.221
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SOME OF

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:49.289
THEM HAVE OBVIOUSLY SUBMITTED

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:51.491
PLANS TO THE AWAY SEE FOR USING

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:53.126
THOSE INNOVATION FUNDS. AND

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.761
THEN VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.796
BOTH REMITTED AND OR REVERTED

01:48:56.863 --> 01:48:59.432
BACK TO THE COUNTIES AND THOSE

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:00.000
ARE EIGHT MILLION AN EIGHT

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:00.834
POINT SIX MILLION SO JUST WANT

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:03.536
TO. I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT IN

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:04.938
TERMS OF I THINK THAT'S A

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:07.474
FAIRLY GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:08.041
THIS HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:12.345
USE. THE AUDIT HAD ALSO ASKED

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.513
THAT WE CLARIFY THAT THE

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.447
INTEREST EARNED ON AND SPENT AN

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:15.181
HSA FUNDS WAS SUBJECT TO

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.383
REVERSION AND SO WE DID THAT

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.284
THROUGH BOTH AN INFORMATION

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.953
NOTICE AND INCLUDED IT. IN THE

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:20.553
FISCAL REGULATIONS PACKAGE SO

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:23.990
THAT HAS BEEN DONE. THE THIRD

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.358
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE NEEDED

01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:26.760
TO ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:30.563
UPROOTED RESERVE LEVEL. AND SO

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:32.098
WE HAVE DONE THAT WE INITIALLY

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.667
SET THAT AS THROUGH AN

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:34.668
INFORMATION NOTICING THAT IT

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:35.735
WAS SET AT THIRTY THREE

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.270
PERCENT. OF THE LARGEST

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:38.738
DISTRIBUTION TO THE COUNTY FROM

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:39.639
THE IMAGE AS A FUND IN THE

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:41.641
FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:42.742
SUBSEQUENTLY YOU THE

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.544
LEGISLATURE I CHANGE THAT W.

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.713
NIGHT CODE TO SAY THAT. THE

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:47.781
PRUDENT RESERVE COULD NOT

01:49:47.847 --> 01:49:50.850
EXCEED 33% OF THE AVERAGE CSS

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:53.153
REVENUE RECEIVED IN THE PRIOR

01:49:53.219 --> 01:49:55.355
FIVE YEARS AND SO WE CHANGE

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:56.656
THAT THROUGH A SEPARATE

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.525
SUBSEQUENT INFORMATION NOTICE.

01:49:58.591 --> 01:50:00.560
AND THEN WE HAVE ALSO ADDRESS

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:03.463
THAT AND THE REGULATIONS THAT

01:50:03.530 --> 01:50:07.300
WERE FILED WITH THE A. L. THE

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:09.970
AUDITOR HAD NOTED. A TWO

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:10.603
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:11.304
DOLLAR FUND BALANCE AND THE

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:14.007
MHSAA FUND AS PART OF THE AUDIT

01:50:14.074 --> 01:50:16.676
THAT FROM A STATE FISCAL

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:18.411
PERSPECTIVE IS ALMOST LIKE

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:21.181
SAYING YOU HAVE AN OPEN LINE OF

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.116
CREDIT BUT WITH NO CREDIT

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:24.651
CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT AND SO

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.653
WE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.021
OF FINANCE AND THE

01:50:28.088 --> 01:50:29.456
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO MAKE

01:50:29.522 --> 01:50:31.558
SURE THAT THAT ACCOUNT WAS A

01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:32.792
DIDN'T HAVE ANY CASH IN IT AND

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:33.893
THEN BE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.061
CLOSED AND I THINK THAT WAS

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:39.332
ALSO. SOME OF THE- AFTER

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.266
EFFECTS OF MOVING THE

01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:41.735
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH THE

01:50:41.801 --> 01:50:42.769
COMMUNITY PORTION OF THE

01:50:42.836 --> 01:50:43.670
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:44.671
INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.006
CARE SERVICES. SO THERE WAS

01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:47.273
PROBABLY SOME HISTORICAL CLEAN

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.408
UP THAT JUST HADN'T BEEN

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:50.210
ACCOUNTED FOR SO WE APPRECIATED

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:50.810
THE AUDITOR. BRINGING THAT TO

01:50:50.877 --> 01:50:55.715
OUR ATTENTION. AS NOTED AS- WE

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:58.218
WERE. ASKED TO SUBMIT YOU KNOW

01:50:58.284 --> 01:50:59.552
FISCAL REGULATIONS AND

01:50:59.619 --> 01:51:01.254
IMPLEMENT A WITH WHOLE PROCESS

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:01.888
FOR COUNTIES THAT WERE OUT OF

01:51:01.955 --> 01:51:03.156
COMPLIANCE WITH SUBMITTING

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:05.825
REPORTS. SO JUST RECALL

01:51:05.892 --> 01:51:08.161
COUNTIES HAVE TO SUBMIT ANNUAL

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:09.295
REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:11.931
TO US AND SOME. OF THOSE HAD

01:51:11.998 --> 01:51:13.400
NOT BEEN DONE EITHER IN QUITE

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:14.634
SOME TIME OR WERE QUITE

01:51:14.701 --> 01:51:17.070
DELAYED. WE IMPLEMENTED A WITH

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:18.671
WHOLE PROCESS BACK IN SEPTEMBER

01:51:18.738 --> 01:51:22.375
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO FOR ANY

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.376
COUNTY THAT DOES NOT SUBMIT

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:25.412
THEIR ARI ARE ON TIME WE

01:51:25.478 --> 01:51:26.980
WITHHOLD TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:29.582
OF THEIR MHSAA ALLOCATION UNTIL

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.618
SUCH TIME AS THOSE ARI OURS ARE

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:34.554
SUBMITTED TO US. WE DON'T HAVE

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:36.890
A 100% COMPLIANCE BUT WE ARE

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:38.892
AND WE HAVE SEEN. EXTRAORDINARY

01:51:38.958 --> 01:51:41.528
AMOUNT OF RESPONSE FROM THE

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:43.063
COUNTIES AND SO THERE ARE VERY

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.097
FEW COUNTIES THAT ARE STILL ON

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:46.466
A WITH HOLD FOR. FAILURE TO

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:47.467
SUBMIT ARI OURS AND WE HAVE

01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.536
BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH. THE

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:50.336
COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE

01:51:50.403 --> 01:51:52.072
ASSOCIATION TO TRY TO ENSURE

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:53.173
THAT THAT COUNTIES ARE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.374
COMPLYING WITH THAT AND THEN

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:57.210
ONCE THEY DO FILED ARI OURS WE

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:58.611
RELEASE THOSE FUNDS AND SO. ONE

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:02.649
COUNTY FILED MULTIPLE YEARS AND

01:52:02.715 --> 01:52:03.283
WE FINALLY REVERTED THOSE FUNDS

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:09.022
LAST MONTH. WE WERE ASKED TO

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:09.522
ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:11.057
CONDUCTING COMPREHENSIVE

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.725
PROGRAM REVIEWS AND STARTING

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:14.461
THOSE REVIEWS ON THIS IS A

01:52:14.527 --> 01:52:16.062
PLACE AND TIME OF THE AGENDA

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:17.630
THAT WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE CAME

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:18.798
TO THE LEGISLATURE ASTRA

01:52:18.865 --> 01:52:20.467
RESOURCES TO DO THAT WORK AND

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.836
YOU RESPONDED YOU GAVE US

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:23.436
THIRTEEN POSITIONS TO DO BOTH

01:52:23.503 --> 01:52:24.637
FISCAL AND PROGRAMMATIC

01:52:24.704 --> 01:52:26.606
OVERSIGHT AND SO THOSE PROGRAM

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:29.175
REVIEWS HAVE STARTED WE DID THE

01:52:29.242 --> 01:52:31.611
FIRST ROUND OF THOSE WE DID FOR

01:52:31.678 --> 01:52:33.213
COUNTIES IN THE SUMMER AND FALL

01:52:33.279 --> 01:52:35.181
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN WE

01:52:35.248 --> 01:52:35.982
ARE ON TRACK TO DO

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:38.918
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS

01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:40.553
FOR UP TO TWENTY IN THE FISCAL

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:43.289
YEAR. SO BECAUSE THERE'S FIFTY

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:44.791
EIGHT COUNTIES WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:46.893
GET TO THEM EVERY STEP ALL OF

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.794
THEM AT THE SAME TIME AND SO WE

01:52:47.861 --> 01:52:48.695
PUT THEM THROUGH A ROTATING

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:51.764
BASIS FROM JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:52.966
NINETEEN THROUGH JUNE OF THIS

01:52:53.032 --> 01:52:55.535
THIS JUST TWO MONTHS AGO WE DID

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.036
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS

01:52:57.103 --> 01:52:59.205
FOR NAPA SAN LUIS OBISPO MAYOR

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:01.040
OPPOSE A LOS ANGELES IMPERIAL

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:03.209
GLENN KERN ALPINE SKIER

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:06.045
RIVERSIDE AND SISKIYOU SOME OF

01:53:06.112 --> 01:53:07.447
THOSE COUNTIES RECEIVED

01:53:07.514 --> 01:53:09.349
FINDINGS SO WHEN WE DO THESE

01:53:09.415 --> 01:53:10.650
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM REVIEWS

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:13.286
WERE LOOKING AT A SERIES OF

01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:15.121
EITHER PROGRAM AREAS ARE POLICY

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:17.090
AREAS AND SIMILAR TO HOW WE

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:18.658
WOULD DO AN AUDIT AND MEDI CAL

01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:19.659
WE WILL ISSUE LIKE AN AUDIT

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:20.693
FINDING AND SAY THERE'S A

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.895
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN THAT'S

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.596
NEEDED AND SO. WE HAVE DONE

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:24.597
THAT WITH SOME OF THESE

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:25.765
COUNTIES AND SO WE WILL BE

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:27.667
POSTING BOTH THE PROGRAM REVIEW

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.135
AS WELL AS ANY OF ROTH THE

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:30.503
RESPONSES FROM THE COUNTIES BUT

01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:35.008
I THINK OVERALL AND WE HAVE NOT

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:40.513
NOTED ANY SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.381
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:41.981
THINGS THAT HAVE CONTINUE TO

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:42.615
CHALLENGE THE COUNTIES ARE THE

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:43.483
THINGS THAT WERE SEEN

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.884
CONSISTENTLY IN THE PROGRAM

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.352
VIEWS AND I THINK THIS ALSO

01:53:46.419 --> 01:53:48.087
HELPS DETERMINE. THE AREAS IN

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.455
WHICH WE TRY TO PROVIDE

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:52.759
ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:55.862
SOME OF THE NARRATIVE AROUND

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:56.663
WHAT THE COUNTIES ARE DOING IN

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.798
TERMS OF YOU KNOW I WOULD AND I

01:53:58.865 --> 01:53:59.365
SHOULD STEP BACK AND JUST

01:53:59.432 --> 01:54:01.734
REMIND. THE COMMITTEE THE

01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:03.536
COUNTIES THEMSELVES WHEN THEY

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.638
SET OUT EITHER PROGRAMS OR

01:54:05.705 --> 01:54:06.439
INITIATIVES THAT THEY WANT TO

01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:07.540
FUND WITH THEIR IMAGES TO SEE

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:09.542
AN HSA FUNDS. THEY HAVE TO GO

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:10.610
THROUGH A LOCAL PLANNING

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.345
PROCESS AND OBVIOUSLY GOING

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:13.646
THROUGH LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:14.847
IF SOME OF YOU HAVE BEEN EITHER

01:54:14.914 --> 01:54:16.382
BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS OR CITY

01:54:16.449 --> 01:54:17.951
COUNCIL YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:19.919
SOMETIMES THAT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:21.888
LONGER. AND SO THE LOCAL

01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:24.157
PLANNING PROCESS I THINK IT HAS

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:25.191
DEFINITELY BEEN NOTED AS

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:27.193
SOMETHING THAT IS SUCCESSFUL

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.962
THE BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ALL

01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:30.730
COMPLY WITH THE WAY IN WHICH

01:54:30.797 --> 01:54:33.099
THOSE FUNDS ARE. EITHER

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.500
DEVELOPS DETERMINED OR PROGRAMS

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.502
AT A LOCAL LEVEL BUT WHAT WE

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:37.737
HAVE NOTED ISSOMETIMES THE

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:39.439
NARRATIVE AROUND WHAT IS

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:41.307
REPORTED TO US IS NOT ALWAYS AS

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:43.376
FULLY. ENCOMPASSING AS WE WOULD

01:54:43.443 --> 01:54:44.477
LIKE IT TO BE JUST BECAUSE IT'S

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:46.045
HARD TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:49.582
EITHER APPROVED OR INCLUDED IN

01:54:49.649 --> 01:54:51.584
IN THE LOCAL PLAN AND SO SOME

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:54.487
OF THOSE HAVE COME UP IN IN THE

01:54:54.554 --> 01:54:55.088
COUNTRY. COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM

01:54:55.154 --> 01:55:01.928
REVIEWS. I WOULD SAY ALSO THAT.

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:03.162
THERE HAVE BEEN AS LACK OF

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.330
CONSISTENCY AND HOW THEY BOTH A

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:05.765
DOCUMENT THEIR PROGRAMS AND

01:55:05.832 --> 01:55:07.700
WHAT THEY NAMED THEM SO WHEN

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:10.737
YOU TRY TO MATCH UP A LOCALLY

01:55:10.803 --> 01:55:13.306
APPROVED PLAN AND THEN YOU TRY

01:55:13.373 --> 01:55:15.008
TO MATCH IT UP TO ITS ANNUAL

01:55:15.074 --> 01:55:17.210
EXPENDITURE REPORT SOMETIMES

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:18.678
THEY DON'T MATCH AND SO WE'VE

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.280
HAD TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:21.447
THE COUNTY IS JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:22.682
THAT WHEN THEY ARE DOING THOSE

01:55:22.749 --> 01:55:24.250
TWO DOCUMENTS THAT WE CAN LINK

01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:25.585
THEM UP AND  THINK THAT'S NOT

01:55:25.652 --> 01:55:27.320
NECESSARILY. A BIG THING IT'S

01:55:27.387 --> 01:55:28.488
JUST YOU KNOW THEIR THREE YEAR

01:55:28.554 --> 01:55:30.423
PLANS AND SO IF STAFF CHANGES

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:31.924
OR SOMETHING HAPPENS THOSE TEND

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:32.859
TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:36.429
DIFFICULT TO TRACK AND THEN

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.298
LASTLY SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:40.033
WE NOTED IN SMALLER COUNTIES IS

01:55:40.099 --> 01:55:42.935
THAT YOU HAVE TO EXPAND 51%

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.370
MORE THAN 51% OF YOUR P. I.

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:46.606
FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS TWENTY

01:55:46.673 --> 01:55:48.941
FIVE OR YEARS OR YOUNGER. IN

01:55:49.008 --> 01:55:51.911
SOME COUNTIES NOT LOS ANGELES

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.246
BUT PERHAPS IN SOME OF A DOCTOR

01:55:53.313 --> 01:55:54.981
WOODS COUNTIES THERE'S ACTUALLY

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:57.383
NOT THAT BIG OF A POPULATION

01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.552
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE IN

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.187
ORDER FOR YOU TO DO SOMETHING

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:03.122
THAT AREA AND SO THAT'S BEEN

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:05.658
SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:10.396
HEARD FROM THE RURAL COUNTIES.

01:56:10.463 --> 01:56:11.397
THE SUCCESS AS I NOTED IN THE

01:56:11.464 --> 01:56:12.065
PROGRAM REVIEWS IS THAT

01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:13.066
COUNTIES HAVE BEEN CIRCULATING

01:56:13.132 --> 01:56:13.733
THEIR THREE YEAR PLAN AN ANNUAL

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.634
UPDATE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:16.302
COMMENT. ON THE BOARDS OF

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:17.704
SUPERVISORS ARE ACTIVELY

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:18.738
ENGAGED IN APPROVING THOSE

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:21.140
PLANS. IN FULL SERVICE

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:22.742
PARTNERSHIPS COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:24.243
DESIGNATING A PERSONAL SERVICE

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:25.678
COORDINATOR CASE MANAGER FOR

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:26.846
EVERY SINGLE CLIENT AS

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:28.381
REQUIRED. SO THAT IS SOMETHING

01:56:28.448 --> 01:56:30.350
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY BOTH

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.951
IMPORTANT CRITICAL TO THE

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:34.821
SUCCESS OF THAT. MOST COUNTIES

01:56:34.887 --> 01:56:35.988
ARE PROVIDING FULL SERVICE

01:56:36.055 --> 01:56:37.623
PARTNERSHIP SERVICES TO ALL AGE

01:56:37.690 --> 01:56:40.426
GROUPS. AND WHAT WE ARE NOTING

01:56:40.493 --> 01:56:42.228
IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN VERY FEW

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:43.429
TREATMENT PLAN ISSUES

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.797
IDENTIFIED WHEN WE GO IN AND

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.065
LOOK AT THE TREATMENT PLANS

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:47.333
THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. IN

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:48.768
MEANING THAT THE CLIENT IS

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:49.869
PARTICIPATING IN THE OVERALL

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:52.605
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR- PLAN AS

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.474
WELL AS ARTICULATING GOALS AND

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.842
THEIR DOCUMENTING. HOW THE

01:56:55.908 --> 01:56:57.310
CLAIM IS PROGRESSING IN THOSE

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.544
GOALS AND THE RESILIENCY IN

01:56:58.611 --> 01:57:00.246
PERSONAL SERVICE COORDINATOR IS

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:01.814
OBVIOUSLY SHOWN TO BE WORKING

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.716
WITH THAT CLIENT. AND THEN

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:04.817
OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE OTHER

01:57:04.884 --> 01:57:06.018
SUCCESSES THAT WE ARE HEARTENED

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:08.688
BY IS THAT SOME. NOT NOT ALL

01:57:08.755 --> 01:57:09.722
BUT SOME COUNTIES ARE OFFERING

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:13.626
HOUSING SUPPORT IN SOME FORM.

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:16.162
YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF AN HSA. WE

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:19.132
AT THE- STATE DEPARTMENT OF

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:20.299
HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE

01:57:20.366 --> 01:57:21.534
MEDICAL PROGRAM THROUGH A WHOLE

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.735
PERSON CARE. HAVE BEEN

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:26.606
PROVIDING HOUSING SUPPORT. TO

01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:27.407
MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES I THINK

01:57:27.473 --> 01:57:28.641
THAT IS HELP TO AUGMENT SOME OF

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.009
THE WORK AND THE FUNDING THAT

01:57:30.076 --> 01:57:31.310
HAS BEEN. DONE AND PERFORM

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:33.146
THROUGH EMIT AN HSA AND SO I

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:34.380
THINK YOU KNOW WHEN YOU STEP

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:35.248
BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE

01:57:35.314 --> 01:57:36.883
DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES. AND

01:57:36.949 --> 01:57:38.518
WHAT IS BEEN DRIVEN DOWN AT THE

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:39.886
COUNTY LEVEL IN TERMS OF

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.187
RESPONSIBILITY AND

01:57:41.254 --> 01:57:43.156
ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU KNOW TO A

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:44.791
DOCTOR WOODS EARLIER COMMENT

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:47.026
AROUND IT'S BEEN A LOT AND THE

01:57:47.093 --> 01:57:49.562
RESPONSIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:50.663
I THINK WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.498
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:54.033
COUNTIES AND HOW THEY ACHIEVE.

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.436
ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT BOTH

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:59.439
COMPLIANCE ISSUES AS WELL AS-

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.174
OVERALL GOALS TOWARDS CERTAIN

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:06.913
INDIVIDUALS WITH BOTH. MENTAL

01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:07.413
HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:15.888
DISORDER SO. I'M HAPPY TO. STOP

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:16.489
THERE AND TAKE QUESTIONS BUT

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:17.123
CERTAINLY WANTED TO APPRECIATE

01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:17.990

IMPORTANT WORK OF THE AUDITOR

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:24.130

YOUR- HUGE STRIDES IN

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:34.474
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN

ADDRESSING THE- LARGELY KIND OF

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:35.608
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES AS

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:38.845
IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDIT. THAT

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:39.412
DOESN'T IN THAT IS A REALLY

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:41.147
GOOD AT THE HEART AS- IS THIS

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:44.016
STUFF WORKING. IS THE MONEY

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.318
HAVING IMPACTED WANTED TO HAVE

01:58:45.384 --> 01:58:47.420
AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHO

01:58:47.487 --> 01:58:50.122
EITHER ON YOUR TEAM ELSEWHERE.

01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:52.492
WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND GO

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:53.125
TO BED BED EVERY NIGHT THINKING

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:56.395
ABOUT THAT. WELL I WOULD SAY

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:58.264
THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.765
INDIVIDUALS IN THE DEPARTMENT

01:58:59.832 --> 01:59:01.200
THAT PROBABLY GO TO SLEEP

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:04.804
THINKING ABOUT IT AND PROBABLY

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:05.538
WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:59:05.605 --> 01:59:07.006
NIGHT I'M LOOKING AT. A LOT SHE

01:59:07.073 --> 01:59:07.640
SENDS ME EMAILS IN THE MIDDLE

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:12.278
OF THE NIGHT. I THINK THAT. IT

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:15.781
HAS BEEN A REALLY LONG ROAD

01:59:15.848 --> 01:59:25.324
FROM. I CAN RECALL. YOU KNOW

01:59:25.391 --> 01:59:27.493
I'VE I'VE DONE HEALTH CARE FOR

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.662
A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE TIMES

01:59:29.729 --> 01:59:30.530
IN WHICH MENTAL HEALTH OR

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:31.564
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WAS

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.065
BROUGHT UP. WHEN I FIRST

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:34.400
STARTED WORKING IN THIS AREA

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:38.004
WAS HARDLY EVER AND EVEN WITH

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:39.672
THE PASSAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:40.907
CARE ACT IT WAS KIND OF NOTED

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:42.975
AS THERE'S THIS. THERE'S THIS

01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:44.277
ITEM ON THE TENNIS INTO HEALTH

01:59:44.343 --> 01:59:45.878
BENEFITS THAT SOMEHOW INDICATES

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:46.913
THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:49.382
ABOUT THIS BUT- REALLY THE

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:53.319
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REDESIGN.

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:55.721
OUR SYSTEM AND WE THINK AND

01:59:55.788 --> 01:59:57.189
SYSTEMS RIGHT. MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:59:57.256 --> 01:59:58.958
IS HOW DO WE SUPPORT. COUNTIES

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:00.393
BROADLY RATE WITH FINANCING

02:00:00.459 --> 02:00:01.727
DIRECTION AND TECHNICAL

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:03.896
ASSISTANCE BUT UNDERLYING ALL

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:06.499
OF THOSE BIG SYSTEM THOUGHTS

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:09.502
ARE A DEEP ABIDING PASSION FOR

02:00:09.569 --> 02:00:11.170
THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:12.605
STRUGGLING IN THOSE COUNTIES

02:00:12.672 --> 02:00:14.974
AND COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW SO

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:19.078

FRIENDS OURSELVES HAVE ISSUES

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:27.420
WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND I THINK

02:00:27.486 --> 02:00:28.487
THAT'S WHAT DRIVES A LOT OF

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:30.189
PEOPLE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. I'M

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:32.091
NOT JUST IN THE DIVISIONS THAT

02:00:32.158 --> 02:00:33.059
ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.894
MENTAL HEALTH BUT ACROSS THE-

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:37.463
THE DIFFERENT AREAS. WE HAVE A

02:00:53.145 --> 02:00:54.614
LOT OF THE ISSUES AROUND

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.449
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PROBABLY

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:59.051
READ IT WE HAVE. WE HAVE

02:00:59.118 --> 02:01:01.821
REORGANIZED OUR DEPARTMENT AND

02:01:01.887 --> 02:01:03.756
TAKEN AWAY ANY KIND OF MENTAL

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.691
HEALTH VERSUS SUBSTANCE USE

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:07.493
DIVISION REFERENCE AND WE HAVE

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.729
COMBINED THEM INTO BEHAVIORAL

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:10.963
HEALTH. DIVISION BUT I THINK

02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:14.066
THAT IS ALSO. WE SIGNIFICANT

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:15.067
IMPORTANT FOR US AS A

02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:17.837
DEPARTMENTS TO INDICATE THAT A

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:19.972
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.074
HAVING A SUBSTANCE USE.

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.342
DISORDER PROBLEM ALSO HAVE A

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:24.910
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM OR FOR SO

02:01:24.977 --> 02:01:26.078
AND THE IMPORTANCE IN THE LAW

02:01:26.145 --> 02:01:27.647
WHICH OF THE TWO. SPECIAL LOOK

02:01:27.713 --> 02:01:30.182
AT LARGER SOCIETAL ISSUES SUCH

02:01:30.249 --> 02:01:34.253
AS LISTENERS. SO. IT'S ONE

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.154
THING TO SAY WORKING AS A TO

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:35.721
SAY IT GETTING BETTER AND I

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:36.389
WOULD SAY THAT IT'S BOTH. IT IS

02:01:36.455 --> 02:01:36.989
WORKING FROM THE STANDPOINT

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:37.590
THAT WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDING

02:01:37.657 --> 02:01:38.858
IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO WHAT

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:41.060
THE COUNTIES ARE DOING. WE ARE

02:01:41.127 --> 02:01:44.163
IN THE PROCESS OF BOTH CREATING

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.464
THE SYSTEMS THAT ACCOUNT FOR

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:47.733
THOSE OUTCOMES THERE HAVE NOT

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.101
TRADITIONALLY BEEN A LOT OF

02:01:49.168 --> 02:01:50.770
MEASUREMENT. PIECES THAT YOU

02:01:50.836 --> 02:01:52.805
COULD ACTUALLY SAVE IS SOMEONE

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:55.141
BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE

02:01:55.207 --> 02:01:56.342
TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO AND IF

02:01:56.409 --> 02:01:58.477
YOU'RE USING JUST VERY. BASIC

02:01:58.544 --> 02:01:59.679
DATA IT MAY NOT TELL YOU THE

02:01:59.745 --> 02:02:01.681
FULL ACCOUNTING OF IT AND YOU

02:02:01.747 --> 02:02:03.683
KNOW A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHEN I

02:02:03.749 --> 02:02:04.450
FIRST STARTED THE DEPARTMENT

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:05.584
THERE IS A LOT OF ATTENTION

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.553
AROUND. CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:08.587
THAT WERE RECEIVING

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:10.790
PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS AND

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.892
MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WERE

02:02:12.958 --> 02:02:13.426
RECEIVING ONE OR MORE ANTI

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:15.961
PSYCHOTICS. AND THE LARGE

02:02:16.028 --> 02:02:17.596
QUESTION FOR US IS THE

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:18.664
DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH SOCIAL

02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:20.533
SERVICES AND THE COURTS. AND

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:21.434
THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE

02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.502
AGENCIES WAS. ARE THESE

02:02:23.569 --> 02:02:24.904
CHILDREN BEING MEDICATED

02:02:24.970 --> 02:02:26.806
APPROPRIATELY AND ALL OF US HAD

02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:27.873
TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SAY

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:29.275
WELL WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE. AND

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.576
THERE WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.311
EFFORT AROUND DATA MATCHING AND

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:34.313
SHARING OF INFORMATION. AND

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:36.082
WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THOSE

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.683
PIECES TOGETHER AND THEN LOOK

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:39.251
AT MEASURES AROUND THE

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:41.220
APPROPRIATE USE OF AND

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:42.354
MANAGEMENT OF THOSE

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:44.523
MEDICATIONS. WHAT WE WERE ABLE

02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:45.791
TO SEE FROM THE DATA IS THAT

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:46.892
CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE

02:02:46.959 --> 02:02:47.960
ACTUALLY WERE HAVING BOTH

02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:49.528
BETTER OUTCOMES. AND HAVING

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:52.331
BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THOSE

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:55.034
DRUGS THAN CHILDREN LARGER MORE

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.669
LARGELY TREATED IN THE MEDICAL

02:02:56.736 --> 02:02:58.137
PROGRAM. SO IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S

02:02:58.204 --> 02:02:59.872
BOTH AN INTERESTING DATA

02:02:59.939 --> 02:03:00.973
EXERCISE BUT IT'S ALSO

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.608
IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR US TO

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:03.809
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR

02:03:03.876 --> 02:03:06.378
LARGER PROGRAM. SO TO YOU FOR

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:08.447
YOUR QUESTION SAYING DOES THIS

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:09.048
WORK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:10.783
WHERE IT'S LIKE WILL. WE HAVE

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:12.384
TO KIND OF DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT

02:03:12.451 --> 02:03:14.120
IS IT THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE

02:03:14.186 --> 02:03:15.221
WHAT DO WE CONSIDER TO BE

02:03:15.287 --> 02:03:17.256
SUCCESS AND ARE WE ON A PATH TO

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.724
GET IN THERE AND I THINK THE

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:20.860
ANSWER IS STILL YET TO BE

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:23.963
FULLY. BOTH DETERMINED ANSWERED.

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:27.767
SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS AS. I

02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:28.901
IS BUILDING A FRAMEWORK TO

02:03:28.968 --> 02:03:31.270
EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF OUR

02:03:31.337 --> 02:03:33.172
INVESTMENTS IS THAT I WOULD SAY

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:34.840
THE SOPHISTICATION AROUND THE

02:03:34.907 --> 02:03:38.344
DATA THE SOPHISTICATION AROUND

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:41.614
THE USE OF. EVIDENCE BASED

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.249
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:46.318
TO WORK ALL OF THAT IS EVOLVING

02:03:46.385 --> 02:03:48.487
THE FIELD ITSELF I THINK IS

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:50.222
ALSO EVOLVING THERE'S

02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:51.791
INCREASING SOPHISTICATION

02:03:51.857 --> 02:03:55.494
AROUND. THE USE OF DIFFERENT

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.496
TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS TO HELP

02:03:57.563 --> 02:04:01.066
MANAGE POPULATIONS I KNOW THAT

02:04:01.133 --> 02:04:02.134
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:04:02.201 --> 02:04:03.569
CONVERSATION IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:04:03.636 --> 02:04:06.372
THIS YEAR ROUND PEER COUNSELORS

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:07.673
SO SIMILAR TO PROMOTE TORTOISE

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:10.476
AND THE MANAGED THE MET AT

02:04:10.543 --> 02:04:12.778
MEDICAL SIDE OF HELPING YOU

02:04:12.845 --> 02:04:14.346
KNOW SPECIFIC POPULATIONS I

02:04:14.413 --> 02:04:15.614
THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:04:15.681 --> 02:04:18.150
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DO A

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:19.685
LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK AND THE

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:21.487
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF SPACE. AND

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:23.122
WE ARE BOTH ENGAGED IN THAT

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:24.623
WORK BUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:27.026
THAT'S A LONG IT'S A LONG AND

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:29.562
EVOLUTION AND IT TAKES A NUMBER

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:32.665
OF CONSISTENT YEARS OF BOTH

02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:33.299
FUNDING AN EFFORT TO GET TO GET

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:37.570
FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. THANK

THAT WE BELIEVE WE'VE MADE A

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:01.060
SINCE THE AUDIT IN HELPING TO

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.494
REMEDY. BUT SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:04.129
THAT WERE FLAGGED BY THAT THE

02:05:04.196 --> 02:05:05.831
AUDIT I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF

LOCAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE

02:05:11.503 --> 02:05:12.538

FUNDING AND I'M JOINED. ON

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:22.014
WILL SPEAK MUCH MUCH MORE.

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.849
ELOQUENTLY AND FROM THE GROUND

02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:26.552
ON HOW HOW THE EXPERIENCES OF

02:05:26.619 --> 02:05:29.054
MANAGING AN HSA FUNDS MY

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:30.689
COMMENTS TODAY ARE CENTERED

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.424
AROUND THE VOLATILITY OF THE

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:34.159
IMAGES SAY AS A REVENUE SOURCE

02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:35.861
FOR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH PLANS.

02:05:35.928 --> 02:05:37.162
AND HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR LEVELS

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:39.832
OF UNSPENT FUNDS IMPROVEMENTS

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:41.700
AS WELL AS ON GOING CHALLENGES

02:05:41.767 --> 02:05:43.035
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INNOVATION

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.937
FUND EXPENDITURES. AND THEN THE

02:05:45.004 --> 02:05:46.672
OVERSIGHT OF THE IMAGE TO SAY

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:47.673
FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.376
SINCE LAST YEAR'S AUDIT. AND I

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:52.544
WILL HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS ON

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.847
HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN BOTH A

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:56.048
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR TO

02:05:56.115 --> 02:05:57.549
REGULATORS AS WELL AS- PROGRAM

02:05:57.616 --> 02:06:00.686
OVERSIGHT. SO ON THAT THEY

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:02.021
HISTORY IN THE VOLATILITY I

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:04.023
THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:06.692
LOOK BACK A BIT AND RECALL

02:06:06.759 --> 02:06:08.527
THAT. THE VOTER APPROVED

02:06:08.594 --> 02:06:10.663
MILLIONAIRES TAX TO FUND

02:06:10.729 --> 02:06:12.898
BEHAVIOR OF PROGRAMS OR MENTAL

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.700
HEALTH PROGRAMS CAME JUST AT

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:17.236
THE RIGHT TIME. WE GOT OUR

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:19.905
FIRST DISBURSEMENTS IN TWO

02:06:19.972 --> 02:06:21.907
THOUSAND FIVE SIX WHICH WAS.

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:23.976
JUST OVER A YEAR YEAR AND A

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:25.177
HALF BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION

02:06:25.244 --> 02:06:28.781
HIT CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.249
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND THAT

02:06:30.316 --> 02:06:33.953
POINT MHSAA RESERVE REVENUES

02:06:34.019 --> 02:06:36.588
ARE MUCH LOWER THAN THEY ARE

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:38.390
TODAY. I THINK WE WERE STARTED

02:06:38.457 --> 02:06:44.730
OUT OR TWO AND- THEN AND THEY

02:06:44.797 --> 02:06:51.303
WERE ALSO THE FIRST FIVE YEARS.

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:55.708
OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ME. WHICH IN

02:06:55.774 --> 02:06:58.077
THOSE YEARS TO USE THE M. HSA

02:06:58.143 --> 02:07:00.679
TO HELP US ABSORB THE IMPACTS

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:03.282
OF THE BUDGET RECESSION. AND IN

02:07:03.349 --> 02:07:05.217
ADDITION IT SWEPT UP CLOSE TO A

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:07.286
BILLION DOLLARS AN HSA REVENUES

02:07:07.353 --> 02:07:08.854
INTO THE GENERAL FUND TO HELP

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:12.024
WITH OVERALL BUDGET STABILITY.

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:14.093
THESE ARE SORT OF HISTORIC

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:14.994
ACTIONS BUT I THINK THEY ALSO

02:07:15.060 --> 02:07:16.395
SPEAK TO KIND OF WHAT WE WERE

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:18.397
EXPERIENCING. IN THOSE EARLY

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:21.400
YEARS OF LIFTING UP THE MHSAA

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.535
AND WHY IT IS THAT THE IMAGES

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:25.170
SAY LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:27.773
TODAY. IN THE ROLE THAT IT

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.875
PLAYS IN OUR OVERALL BEHAVIORAL

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:31.944
HEALTH SAFETY NET AND DELIVERY

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:34.346
SYSTEM FOR US OVERALL IT. YOU

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:37.316
KNOW THE IMAGES SAYS ABOUT 20%

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:37.783
OF THE OF THE STATE'S

02:07:37.850 --> 02:07:40.753
INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC

02:07:40.819 --> 02:07:43.155
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:44.590
COUNTIES IT'S ABOUT A QUARTER.

02:07:44.656 --> 02:07:47.593
A TWO DAY OF WHAT WE SPEND AND

02:07:47.659 --> 02:07:48.994
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:51.463
TO THAT. ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:07:51.530 --> 02:07:54.666
I THINK FOLKS CONSIDER COUNTY

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.168
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONFUSING OR

02:07:56.235 --> 02:07:59.104
COMPLICATED. IS BECAUSE WE ARE

02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:01.840
NOT. JUST SERVING ONE

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:05.811
POPULATION SO YOU KNOW UNLIKE

02:08:05.878 --> 02:08:07.279
MEDI CAL WORDS THAT YOU KNOW

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:09.815
MEDI CAL THE BENEFICIARIES

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:11.450
UNDER CERTAIN YOU KNOW. INCOME

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.819
THRESHOLD COUNTIES RECEIVE

02:08:13.886 --> 02:08:17.423
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AS WELL AS

02:08:17.489 --> 02:08:20.259
GRANTS AND ME TO SAY FUNDS TO

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:21.693
SERVE A VARIETY OF POP

02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.462
POPULATIONS DEPENDING ON THE

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.964
FUNDING STREAM SO WE HAVE

02:08:26.031 --> 02:08:28.033
RESPONSIBILITY YES FOR THE

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.436
MEDIC HOW POPPY. XIN THAT HAS A

02:08:30.502 --> 02:08:32.638
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:35.741
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. BUT WE

02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:38.210
ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:40.646
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN CRISS

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:42.047
REGARDLESS OF THEIR PAY YOUR

02:08:42.114 --> 02:08:44.149
SOURCE RIGHT SO YOU COULD HAVE

02:08:44.216 --> 02:08:45.684
BE A PRIVATELY INSURED

02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:49.555
INDIVIDUAL. WHO GETS ON A FIFTY

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:50.522
ONE FIFTY HOLDER NEEDS

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:51.690
CONSERVATORSHIP AND WE ARE

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:54.359
SUPPORT SERVICES. IF YOU'RE IN

02:08:54.426 --> 02:08:57.029
SALES WE ARE SUPPORTING THIS

02:08:57.096 --> 02:09:02.835
SERVICES AND. SO IT'S EIGHT IT

02:09:02.901 --> 02:09:14.746
GETS A LITTLE CONFUSED. SO IT'S

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:17.382
IT IT'S COMPLICATED IN THAT WAY

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:19.218
I THINK OTHERWISE YOU KNOW OF

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:20.786
THE QUARTER THE BULK OF OUR

02:09:20.853 --> 02:09:22.621
FUNDING OBVIOUSLY COMES THROUGH

02:09:22.688 --> 02:09:25.157
MEDI CAL AND THAT IS OUR CORE

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.725
POPULATION. NEAR ME TO SAY IS

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:29.228
CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR MEDIC

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:31.029
HEALTH SERVICES IT BRINGS IN

02:09:31.096 --> 02:09:33.365
CLOSE TO. A BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:35.767
FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:38.203
IT'S ALSO CRITICAL TO BE

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:41.440
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ARE CRISIS

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:46.245
CONTINUE HIMSELF IT'S REALLY AT

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:46.879
AND DR KELLY WILL SPEAK MORE TO

02:09:46.945 --> 02:09:49.314
THAT. SO AS WE TURN THE CORNER

02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:50.349
AND START TO COME OUT OF THE

02:09:50.415 --> 02:09:52.684
GREAT RECESSION IN CALIFORNIA

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:55.220
COUNTIES EXPERIENCED OTHER

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:56.755
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT I

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:58.390
THINK ARE IMPORTANT AND IMPACT

02:09:58.457 --> 02:10:01.894
THE MHSAA EVOLUTION THE FIRST

02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:02.728
ONE IS TWENTY ELEVEN

02:10:02.794 --> 02:10:04.863
REALIGNMENT WHERE WE BRING WITH

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:07.432
IT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.801
CHILDREN AND PUTTING UP THE OF

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:12.070
NON FEDERAL SHARE FOR OUR

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:13.205
CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL THROUGH

02:10:13.272 --> 02:10:15.774
EPS D. T. THE NEXT ONE IS THE

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:16.875
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:18.076
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:20.245
OTHERS HAVE NOTED TODAY. THIS

02:10:20.312 --> 02:10:21.680
BOTH INCREASES THE NUMBER OF

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:22.981
MEDI CAL ELIGIBLES IN OUR

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:24.983
SYSTEM AND ALSO THE NON FEDERAL

02:10:25.050 --> 02:10:26.351
SHARE AND YOU'LL SEE FROM THE

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:28.720
LA OWES GRAPH THAT THE NOT THE

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:31.390
FEDERAL. PORTION OF FUNDING

02:10:31.456 --> 02:10:33.325
THAT COMES INTO OUR SYSTEM HAS

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:34.960
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE

02:10:35.027 --> 02:10:36.028
WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S A GOOD

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:39.298
THING WE ALSO EXPERIENCED TO

02:10:39.364 --> 02:10:40.832
THE CONSOLIDATION A MENTAL

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:42.201
HEALTH UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:44.069
HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE

02:10:44.136 --> 02:10:44.870
ELIMINATION OF WHAT USED TO BE

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:46.138
THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:47.406
HEALTH. ON TOP WITH THESE

02:10:47.472 --> 02:10:50.108
CHANGES SINCE THE GREAT

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:52.277
RECESSION IN CALIFORNIA ARE AN

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:55.013
HSA REVENUES ALONE HAVE MORE

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.350
THAN DOUBLED SO. DH CS HAS AND

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:00.819
ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:03.288
IMPLEMENTED IN IN THIS PAST

02:11:03.355 --> 02:11:07.793
YEAR A 33% CAP ON OUR PRUDENT

02:11:07.859 --> 02:11:09.795
RESERVES IN TERMS OF ALL THAT

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:10.996
THE NEW MONEY THAT WE'RE

02:11:11.063 --> 02:11:13.665
GETTING IN. AND YOU KNOW WE

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:15.834
WANT TO NOTE THAT IN ADDITION

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:18.971
TO THAT 33% TOP THE DEPARTMENT

02:11:19.037 --> 02:11:20.606
HAS ALSO PROPOSED THROUGH THE

02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:22.007
REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PROCESS

02:11:22.074 --> 02:11:24.610
RIGHT NOW A MINIMUM RESERVE

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:27.112
LEVEL OF TWENTY THREE PERCENT.

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:28.347
THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:30.983
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ACTUALLY

02:11:31.049 --> 02:11:32.384
COMMENTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:34.519
THAT WE DO NOT THINK THAT

02:11:34.586 --> 02:11:37.422
HAVING THE MINIMUMS 23% IS A

02:11:37.489 --> 02:11:39.024
GOOD IDEA ALONG WITH THE

02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:42.294
MAXIMUM 33% AND THE REASON IS

02:11:42.361 --> 02:11:44.363
WITH THE VOLATILITY OF THIS

02:11:44.429 --> 02:11:48.133
REVENUE SOURCE THE UPS AND THE

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:48.734
DOWNS. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:55.040
HARD. THE FISCAL MANAGEMENT

02:11:55.107 --> 02:11:57.109
STANDPOINT TO FIGURE OUT THAT

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:58.010
10% SWEET SPOT FROM HERE TO

02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:59.144
HERE AND SORT OF MAINTAIN

02:11:59.211 --> 02:11:59.778
WITHIN THAT AND THEN ON TOP OF

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:00.379
THAT WHEN WE DO HIT THE NEXT

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:01.613
RECESSION WE ARE CONCERNED

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.482
ABOUT OUR ABILITY. TO REACH

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:05.550
INTO THOSE RESERVES TO SUSTAIN

02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:07.986
PROGRAMS ON AN ONGOING BASIS IF

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:10.188
WE'RE REQUIRED AT THAT POINT TO

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:13.325
MAINTAIN THAT 23% LOWER AMOUNT

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:16.194
AS WELL. SO THAT'S ONE THING I

02:12:16.261 --> 02:12:17.296
WANTED TO KNOW IN TERMS OF SOME

02:12:17.362 --> 02:12:19.931
OF THE NEW WAYS THAT THE STATE

02:12:19.998 --> 02:12:21.867
HAS BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:24.636
AUDIT FINDINGS. WE HAVE NOT YET

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.872
TESTED THE THIRTY 3% MAXIMUM

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:30.008
RESERVE LEVEL AND WE WILL FIND

02:12:30.075 --> 02:12:31.310
OUT IN OUR NEXT ECONOMIC

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:33.245
DOWNTURN HOW THAT WORKS FOR US

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:35.080
BUT I CAN SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE

02:12:35.147 --> 02:12:38.984
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:41.320
TO AGAIN. MAINTAIN CORE

02:12:41.386 --> 02:12:42.654
PROGRAMS WHEN WE WHEN WE GET

02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:45.324
INTO A RECESSION AND YOU KNOW

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.692
THE CHALLENGE FOR US AS OTHERS

02:12:46.758 --> 02:12:49.094
HAVE NOTED IS WE MUST ENGAGE

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:50.495
OUR LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS WE THINK

02:12:50.562 --> 02:12:51.863
THAT THAT'S A REALLY VALUABLE

02:12:51.930 --> 02:12:53.465
AND IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAY

02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:55.133
THAT WE RUN OUR PROGRAMS. AND

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.402
SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE

02:12:57.469 --> 02:12:59.404
SURE THAT EVERYBODY'S ON BOARD

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:00.372
WITH WITH HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:00.439 --> 02:13:01.707
SEE IF SEE THROUGHT OUT MORE

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:04.076
CHALLENGING TIMES AND TODAY. IN

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:05.644
ADDITION TO THE PROPOSED

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:08.180
REGULATIONS FROM THE STATE THIS

02:13:08.246 --> 02:13:11.583
YEAR COUNTIES AS DCS NOTED HAVE

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:12.751
BEEN RECEIVING ADDITIONAL

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:14.586
INFORMATIONAL NOTICES TO

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:17.089
PROVIDE CLARIFICATION AND

02:13:17.155 --> 02:13:21.793
GUIDANCE. OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALSO

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.828
REPORTED TO US ABOUT THE AUDITS

02:13:22.894 --> 02:13:23.929
THAT ARE BEING DONE IN SEVERAL

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:25.564
COUNTIES STARTING AT THE END OF

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:27.599
LAST YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:29.000
THAT WE WOULD KNOWN IS THAT

02:13:29.067 --> 02:13:30.635
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THESE

02:13:30.702 --> 02:13:32.471
AUDITS ARE ABOUT COMPLIANCE

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:33.038
WITH OUR SPENDING RULES AND

02:13:33.105 --> 02:13:37.409
THAT. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:39.244
STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT WHEN

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:40.078
THEY LOOKED AT THE THREE

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:41.813
COUNTIES IN THE AUDIT COUNTIES

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.515
WERE GENERALLY DOING A GOOD JOB

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:45.550
OF MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:48.487
THEIR EXPENDITURES. ARE MEMBERS

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:49.788
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:52.557
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:55.160
REGULATORS AS WELL AS COUNTIES

02:13:55.227 --> 02:13:57.062
TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHICH

02:13:57.129 --> 02:13:58.630
PROGRAMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND

02:13:58.697 --> 02:14:00.065
THAT REALLY GETS TO A LOT OF

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.533
WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY BOTH

02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:04.069
FROM DH CS AS WELL AS THE AC. I

02:14:04.136 --> 02:14:05.337
THINK IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL

02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:07.372
ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT WANTING

02:14:07.439 --> 02:14:10.675
TO SEE MORE OF THAT ANALYSIS ON

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:12.644
WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:14.546
AND WHAT WHAT COULD WE CONSIDER

02:14:14.613 --> 02:14:15.914
COUNTY COUNTY TO COUNTY TO

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:18.717
SCALE UP. ONE OF THE THINGS

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.786
THAT I WANT AND NOTICE AND SORT

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:23.388
OF RECOGNIZE THE OAC FOR IS

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:25.023
THEIR NEW WORK ON SOME OF THIS

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:28.527
THESE DATA. MASH UPS THAT TOBY

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:30.829
WAS DESCRIBING IN PARTICULAR WE

02:14:30.896 --> 02:14:32.998
REALLY LOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:35.600
OF JUSTICE. FULL SERVICE

02:14:35.667 --> 02:14:38.670
PARTNERSHIP DATA ANALYSIS IT

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:40.739
WAS ASTONISHING FOR US TO SEE

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.474
THAT FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGH

02:14:42.541 --> 02:14:44.676
NUMBERS OF ARRESTS GOING

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:45.644
THROUGH FULL SERVICE

02:14:45.710 --> 02:14:47.846
PARTNERSHIPS WHILE THEY WERE IN

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:50.081
THE FS P. THEIR ARREST RATE

02:14:50.148 --> 02:14:53.552
WENT DOWN BY 69% AND FOLLOWING

02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:55.954
EXIT. EXITING THE OFFICE P.

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:58.256
EITHER RACE PRESS RATES WENT

02:14:58.323 --> 02:15:02.327
DOWN BY 64% I MEAN THAT IS IT A

02:15:02.394 --> 02:15:03.395
TREMENDOUS RETURN ON IT YES MEN

02:15:03.462 --> 02:15:04.563
AND I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:05.764
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS WRIT

02:15:05.831 --> 02:15:07.299
LARGE YOU KNOW OUR

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:10.235
COLLABORATIONS OUR PARTNERS AND

02:15:10.302 --> 02:15:12.370
OUR INTEGRATION REALLY IS

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:14.272
ACROSS SO MANY DIFFERENT

02:15:14.339 --> 02:15:18.610
SYSTEMS. OTHERS NOTED AGAIN

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:23.949
KELLY WILL SPEAK TO THAT. WITH

02:15:24.015 --> 02:15:30.989
A LOT MORE GRANULAR PRETTY WELL.

02:15:31.056 --> 02:15:32.157
THE STATE'S GUIDANCE ON PRUDENT

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:33.758
RESERVES HAS BEEN VIEWED AS

02:15:33.825 --> 02:15:34.793
VERY HELPFUL TO WORK COUNTIES

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.927
THEY ALSO FELT THAT THEY WOULD

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.362
BENEFIT FROM CHITONS ON

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:38.230
OPERATIONAL RESERVES SO THIS IS

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:39.598
AN AREA. NOT RAISED BY THE

02:15:39.664 --> 02:15:41.366
AUDITOR OR OR BY OTHERS TODAY

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:42.000
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:44.102
COUNTY IS BROUGHT TO US THAT

02:15:44.169 --> 02:15:44.669
THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE REALLY

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:46.505
HELPFUL FOR US. THEY ALSO WOULD

02:15:46.571 --> 02:15:48.139
LIKE TO ASK THAT OUR REGULATORS

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:48.640
CONSULT WITH US MORE IN

02:15:48.707 --> 02:15:49.140
PROVIDING SOME OF THIS

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:50.542
GUIDANCE. AGAIN RIGHT NOW OUR

02:15:50.609 --> 02:15:51.176
PRUDENT RESERVES CAN ONLY BE

02:15:51.243 --> 02:15:52.677
USED IN A MAJOR STATEWIDE

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.679
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND SOME OF

02:15:54.746 --> 02:15:56.448
OUR COUNTIES NOTED THAT WHEN WE

02:15:56.515 --> 02:15:59.217
HAVE LOCAL EMERGENCIES OR

02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:01.419
DISASTERS OR EVEN A LOCAL

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:03.288
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT ISN'T

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:05.090
FELT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT

02:16:05.156 --> 02:16:07.425
THOSE ARE INSTANCES WHERE WE

02:16:07.492 --> 02:16:09.528
SHOULD WE THINK BE ABLE TO

02:16:09.594 --> 02:16:10.762
REACH AND TREVOR SERVICE AND

02:16:10.829 --> 02:16:13.098
USE THOSE. ONE OF THE AREAS

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:14.766
WHERE SPENDING HAS BEEN MOST

02:16:14.833 --> 02:16:16.535
DIFFICULT FOR US AS HAS BEEN

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:17.903
NOTED IS IN OUR INNOVATIONS

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:20.305
PROGRAMS. AND FROM OUR

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:22.140
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE

02:16:22.207 --> 02:16:24.376
REASONS FOR THIS ARE MULTI FOLD

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:26.478
FIRST IT IT'S OBVIOUSLY MORE

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:29.347
CHALLENGING OVER TIME TO COME

02:16:29.414 --> 02:16:32.250
UP WITH THE NEXT NEW INNOVATIVE

02:16:32.317 --> 02:16:37.122
THING. YOU KNOW WITH THE AT THE

02:16:37.188 --> 02:16:38.223
FURTHER WE GET ALONG AN MA TO

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:39.457
SAY THE MORE WE CAN LOOK BACK

02:16:39.524 --> 02:16:40.058
AND SAY WELL SOMEBODY ALREADY

02:16:40.125 --> 02:16:40.725
DID THAT OR THEY DID IT IN THIS

02:16:40.792 --> 02:16:41.326
WAY OR THAT. SO THAT'S ONE

02:16:41.393 --> 02:16:43.728
CHALLENGE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:45.697
SMALLER COUNTIES HAVE LACKEY

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.032
ADMINISTRATIVE OR STAFF

02:16:47.098 --> 02:16:50.335
RESOURCES TO COME UP WITH SOME

02:16:50.402 --> 02:16:51.903
OF THESE INNOVATION PROJECTS.

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:54.372
AND THEN TYPICALLY OVER THE

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:58.510
OVER THE PAST WE'D HAVE HAD

02:16:58.577 --> 02:16:59.010
FIVE THREE TO FIVE YEAR

02:16:59.077 --> 02:17:00.912
PLANNING CYCLES PLANNING

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.480
THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:04.115
AND IT YOU KNOW FOR ANYONE

02:17:04.182 --> 02:17:04.849
WHO'S WORKED IN THE PRIVATE

02:17:04.916 --> 02:17:06.918
SECTOR DONE RESEARCH AND- AND

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:08.253
DEVELOPMENT OR START UPS YOU

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:10.722
COULD UNDERSTAND THAT THREE TO

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:12.290
FIVE YEAR WINDOW TO GO FROM.

02:17:12.357 --> 02:17:15.260
YOU KNOW START TO END IS REALLY

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:18.129
AGGRESSIVE AND YOU KNOW IT'S

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:20.365
NOT IT'S REALLY NOT IN LA ME

02:17:20.432 --> 02:17:21.232
WITH WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:17:21.299 --> 02:17:24.002
WOULD DO SO WE ARE VERY

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:26.338
APPRECIATIVE TO OUR TO THE

02:17:26.404 --> 02:17:28.173
LEGISLATURE TO THE AC AND OTHER

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:29.774
STAKEHOLDERS WHO WORKED WITH US

02:17:29.841 --> 02:17:32.644
TO. WITHIN THE INNOVATIONS

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:35.480
PROJECTS ALLOW US TO A LITTLE

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:37.015
BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY ON

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:38.283
TIMELINE WE THINK THAT THIS IS

02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:40.485
GOING TO DO A LOT TO HELP US

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:42.821
SEE THROUGH EVEN MORE AMBITIOUS

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:44.456
INNOVATION PROJECTS WHICH-

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:46.091
WHICH IS REALLY THE POINT

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:48.793
THERE. WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.362
ALSO STRUGGLED WITH REALLY

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:54.766
SIMPLE. THINGS LIKE GETTING ON

02:17:54.833 --> 02:18:01.339
THE CALENDAR IT THE OAC. SO YOU

02:18:01.406 --> 02:18:02.674
KNOW IF ACCOUNTING SORT OF LEE

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:04.509
IN IN GIVING THE AC THE HEADS

02:18:04.576 --> 02:18:05.510
UP THAT THEY WANT TO APPLY FOR

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:06.478
AN INNOVATION GRANT OR IF THEY

02:18:06.544 --> 02:18:07.145
HAVEN'T GOTTEN ON THE CALENDAR

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:08.246
THEY COULD BE WAITING IN THE

02:18:08.313 --> 02:18:09.180
QUEUE AND MISS THEIR

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:10.048
OPPORTUNITY AND THEY NEED TO

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:10.649
KIND OF GO RIGHT BACK TO THE

02:18:10.715 --> 02:18:12.517
BEGINNING. WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:18:12.584 --> 02:18:15.453
RECOGNIZE THAT THE OAC HAS BEEN

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.322
TREMENDOUS IN TRYING TO CORRECT

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:19.457
FOR SOME OF THOSE SIMPLE

02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:22.661
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES. AND SO

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.229
YOU KNOW AS WE STREAMLINED THIS

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:25.997
WE HOPE TO SEE THOSE INNOVATION

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:27.899
FUNDS MOVING OUT OF THE DOOR

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:30.301
AND DOING SO IN A WAY THAT WE

02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:33.038
WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE. OUR

02:18:33.104 --> 02:18:35.540
MEDIC HEALTH. YOU KNOW

02:18:35.607 --> 02:18:36.675
LEVERAGING THROUGH THE AN HSA

02:18:36.741 --> 02:18:39.310
IS INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW WE THINK

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:42.247
THAT IT'S COR TO ALL OF OUR

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:43.515
PROGRAMS AND YOU KNOW I'LL JUST

02:18:43.581 --> 02:18:45.784
SORT OF JUMP PAST ALL THE

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:46.751
THINGS I WAS GOING TO SAY ABOUT

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:47.952
WHAT THE IMMEDIACY DOES TODAY

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.354
BECAUSE I THINK DR KELLY WILL

02:18:49.421 --> 02:18:52.157
SPEAK TO THAT BETTER BUT YOU

02:18:52.223 --> 02:18:54.559
KNOW WE DO THINK THAT WE NEED

02:18:54.626 --> 02:18:56.761
TO BALANCE WHAT WE DO MOVING

02:18:56.828 --> 02:18:58.763
FORWARD IN TERMS OF OUR

02:18:58.830 --> 02:19:00.465
COMMUNITY VOICES THAT'S REALLY

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:02.934
THE CORE OF THE AN HSA IS SORT

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:04.636
OF BEING LOCALLY DRIVEN AND

02:19:04.703 --> 02:19:07.205
COMMUNITY DRIVEN. WITH OUR OUR

02:19:07.272 --> 02:19:08.907
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR

02:19:08.973 --> 02:19:11.576
PUBLIC DOLLARS AND A REASONABLE

02:19:11.643 --> 02:19:13.478
EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL SPEND

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:16.514
TO THESE FUNDS TIMELY AND IN A

02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:18.249
WAY THAT REALLY HAS AN IMPACT

02:19:18.316 --> 02:19:20.618
ON OUR COMMUNITIES AT THE SAME

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:22.587
TIME WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE A

02:19:22.654 --> 02:19:25.223
THINK AS A BODY THAT THERE'S A

02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:26.391
TON OF VOLATILITY IN THESE

02:19:26.458 --> 02:19:28.626
REVENUE STREAMS THE UPS AND

02:19:28.693 --> 02:19:30.895
DOWNS ARE REALLY HARD TO MANAGE

02:19:30.962 --> 02:19:33.131
AROUND AND PREDICT AND SO WHEN

02:19:33.198 --> 02:19:34.532
YOU START ONE THREE YEAR

02:19:34.599 --> 02:19:36.000
PLANNING CYCLE YOU MIGHT

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.602
ACTUALLY END UP GETTING A LOT

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:39.571
MORE OR A LOT LESS THAN YOU

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:41.005
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO AS YOU GO

02:19:41.072 --> 02:19:43.508
THROUGH THAT PERIOD. AND THAT'S

02:19:43.575 --> 02:19:44.809
MADE PLANNING AROUND SOME OF

02:19:44.876 --> 02:19:46.845
THESE THINGS FOR GOLD FOR SOME

02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:48.813
OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES ARE

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:50.982
SMALLER COUNTIES DON'T SEEM TO

02:19:51.049 --> 02:19:52.851
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SPENDING

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.018
DOWN THERE HAVE YOU TO SAY

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:54.886
DOLLARS IT BY AND LARGE THEY'RE

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:57.856
THEY'RE THEY'RE SPENT BUT FOR

02:19:57.922 --> 02:19:59.791
SOME OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES

02:19:59.858 --> 02:20:03.361
THING AT MY CHURCH TO RECEIVE

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:07.098
AN HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT SPENT

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:09.300
FUNDS ONE OF THE STRATEGY

02:20:09.367 --> 02:20:15.306
THAT'S BEING LLOYD I THINK.

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:15.874
MAYBE MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:22.013
COUNTY BOARDS SUPERVISING. THEY

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.983
ARE OVER SPENT RIGHT NOW. THERE

02:20:25.049 --> 02:20:26.718
PROJECTS AND THEIR PLANS ARE

02:20:26.785 --> 02:20:28.219
OVER WHAT THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:29.120
GOING TO GET IN JUST SO THAT

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:30.188
THEY CAN TRY TO LEVEL OUT SOME

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:31.055
OF THOSE DIFFERENCES AND SO

02:20:31.122 --> 02:20:32.524
THAT SPEAKS TO SOME OF THE

02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:34.459
QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT HOW

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:35.093
WE'RE MANAGING WITH THE UNSPENT

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:36.928
FUNDS GREAT THANKYOU AND I WAS

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:38.296
ABLE TO SAY WE ARE AT NOON

WHICH IS AT THE OFFICIAL AND

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:40.465
FOR HEARING SO IF IT'S NUMBERS

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:41.099
TO NEED TO STEP OUT. COMPLETELY

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:45.470
UNDERSTAND BUT I WOULD LOVE TO

02:20:45.537 --> 02:20:46.104

REALLY AM HERE TO BE THE LOCAL

02:20:58.583 --> 02:20:59.117
COUNTY VOICE AS- SOMEONE WHO'S

02:20:59.184 --> 02:21:01.119
ACTUALLY BEEN ON THE GROUND

02:21:01.186 --> 02:21:01.753
PROVIDING THE SERVICES AND THEN

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.588
CONTINUES TO MONITOR THEM. I

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:05.156
ALSO WANT TO SPEAK TO OUR

02:21:05.223 --> 02:21:08.126
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:08.693
HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.260
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

02:21:09.327 --> 02:21:11.396
COMMISSION. AS WELL AS THE

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:12.497
CHANGES THAT WE MAKE. ON A

02:21:12.564 --> 02:21:14.299
DAILY BASIS THE LIVES OF THOSE

02:21:14.365 --> 02:21:16.467
PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. SO FIRST

02:21:16.534 --> 02:21:18.102
RD MOUNT OUR PARTNERSHIP

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:20.104
COUNTIES CONSIDER OURSELVES TO

02:21:20.171 --> 02:21:23.541
BE ACTIVE INVESTED PARTNERS

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:26.411
WITH DH CS AND THE AC. WE LOOK

02:21:26.477 --> 02:21:27.478
FORWARD TO MORE PRODUCTIVE

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:29.581
COLLABORATIONS NOTICED NOTING

02:21:29.647 --> 02:21:32.150
OF CHALLENGES EXT EXPERIENCE BY

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:33.651
OUR PARTNERS. AND THERE'S A LOT

02:21:33.718 --> 02:21:35.453
OF TALK ABOUT THE ANNUAL

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:36.754
REVENUE EXPENDITURE REPORT THE

02:21:36.821 --> 02:21:39.757
ARE ARE. AND PART OF THAT WE'VE

02:21:39.824 --> 02:21:41.659
WORKED VERY HARD WITH OUR

02:21:41.726 --> 02:21:43.328
PARTNERS AT DH CS. BECAUSE IN

02:21:43.394 --> 02:21:44.929
ORDER TO COMPLETE THAT FORM YOU

02:21:44.996 --> 02:21:46.431
HAVE TO COMPLETE YOUR COST

02:21:46.497 --> 02:21:47.832
REPORT FORM THEY'RE BOTH DO THE

02:21:47.899 --> 02:21:49.500
SAME DATE. SO YOU NEED TO HAVE

02:21:49.567 --> 02:21:51.402
COMPLETED ONE FOLLOWING FISCAL

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:53.304
YEAR TO COMPLETE THE OTHER. AND

02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:54.339
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE HAS

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:55.940
BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THE

02:21:56.007 --> 02:21:57.342
TEMPLATE ITSELF WHICH IS JUST A

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:58.810
VERY LOGISTICAL ISSUE BUT

02:21:58.877 --> 02:22:01.613
IMPACTS EVERYBODY. AND SO WRONG

02:22:01.679 --> 02:22:03.448
FORMULAS ON ON BOTH OF THOSE

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:05.049
FORMS BANK CONTRIBUTED TO US

02:22:05.116 --> 02:22:09.220
NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET THE DATE

02:22:09.287 --> 02:22:09.821
REQUIREMENTS. BUT WE WERE ABLE

02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:14.058
TO WORK WITH DH CS. SO THAT WE

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:14.926
COULD COME A COMPLETE

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:15.527
ADJUSTMENTS IF WE NEED TO DO

02:22:15.593 --> 02:22:17.462
THAT. THE DIFFICULTY IN THAT IS

02:22:17.528 --> 02:22:18.796
THAT THEY ARE OUR DATA IS

02:22:18.863 --> 02:22:19.364
PULLED FROM THE OAC PUT ON

02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:21.266
THEIR DASHBOARD AND THOSE THAT

02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:22.667
INFORMATION MIGHT NOT BE.

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:24.369
INCLUSIVE OF THE ADJUSTMENTS

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.571
BEING MADE AFTER THE MENTAL

02:22:26.638 --> 02:22:28.439
HEALTH SERVICES ACT COST REPORT.

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:29.807
BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THE

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:31.709
RECENTLY ISSUED GUIDANCE AND

02:22:31.776 --> 02:22:32.911
PROGRAMMING AND THE

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:35.513
RESPONSIVENESS I AM THE ABILITY

RESERVES FOR STATEWIDE EAT

02:36:25.676 --> 02:36:28.245
ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS BUT OUR

COULD ALSO REACH AND FOR LOCAL

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.786

PURPOSE IT WAS THERE IN SHORT

02:40:17.541 --> 02:40:19.009
THE MERITS OF THOSE AS FAR AS

02:40:19.076 --> 02:40:21.979
52% 33% THOSE STATISTICS AND

02:40:22.045 --> 02:40:24.014
DATA THAT IS BEING SHOWN HERE

ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS

02:40:26.583 --> 02:40:27.884
ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE LOCAL

02:40:27.951 --> 02:40:29.586

02:40:29.653 --> 02:40:31.788
ACCOUNTABILITY GETTING TO THE

THINGS THAT. WE CONTINUE TO

02:40:58.949 --> 02:40:59.483
LOOK AT IT. THE LOCAL

02:40:59.549 --> 02:40:59.916

THERE TRULY. UP A ONE PIECE

02:41:10.227 --> 02:41:10.727
FITS ALL TYPE OF APPROACH TO

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:13.830
THIS AND THE ANSWER. IS NOW BUT

02:41:13.897 --> 02:41:15.232
THE NEED IS THERE SO HOW DO YOU

02:41:15.298 --> 02:41:18.001
ADJUST THE NEED. TO THE ACTUAL

02:41:18.068 --> 02:41:20.203
COUNTIES THAT ARE THERE ITSELF.

02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:22.272
I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF CRISIS

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:24.641
STABILIZATION UNITS AND I SAY

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:25.175
STIPE STABILIZATION YEARS

02:41:25.242 --> 02:41:27.010
BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST.

02:41:27.077 --> 02:41:29.312
IMPACT THE FIRST THE LINE OF

02:41:29.379 --> 02:41:30.747
DEFENSE BEFORE YOU GET TO THE

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:32.516
CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEFORE YOU

02:41:32.582 --> 02:41:34.284
GET TO THE INCARCERATION BEFORE

YOU GET TO THE SITUATION WHAT

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:38.488
WE SEE SO MANY RATHER ITS ROLE

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:40.824
OR OR LARGE. COUNTIES THAT ARE

02:41:40.891 --> 02:41:42.826
THERE YOU SEE THAT THE HOMELESS

02:41:42.893 --> 02:41:44.861
POPULATION. BUT WITHIN THAT

02:41:44.928 --> 02:41:46.863
HOMELESS POPULATION THERE'S A

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:49.166
SUB POPULATION OF THOSE THAT

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:52.035
HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IF

02:41:52.102 --> 02:41:53.737
WE COULD FOCUS ON AND WE DID

02:41:53.804 --> 02:41:56.273
THIS AT THE COUNTY FOCUSED ON

02:41:56.339 --> 02:41:56.840
SUB POPULATIONS ARE BRINGING

02:41:56.907 --> 02:41:59.810
RESOURCES TO THEM. THERE WERE

02:41:59.876 --> 02:42:00.811
GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN

02:42:00.877 --> 02:42:02.412
EFFECT IN A MEASUREMENT BASED

02:42:02.479 --> 02:42:03.780
ON THE SUB POPULATION THAT'S

02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:06.650
THEIR- MENTAL HEALTH. CONTINUES

02:42:06.716 --> 02:42:08.919
TO BE ONE OF THE- BIGGEST

02:42:08.985 --> 02:42:11.988
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS A

COUNTIES WHEN THERE IS A

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:36.346
DISASTER IN TERMS OF RECEIVING

02:47:36.413 --> 02:47:38.715
WHEN THERE'S A FIFTH OF. A

HAVE A VIEW I BELIEVE A YEAR OR

02:47:59.569 --> 02:48:01.805
SO ONCE THAT I DID. ONCE THEY

02:48:01.871 --> 02:48:03.473

A YEAR AFTER THE DISASTER HAS

02:48:04.441 --> 02:48:06.209
BEEN DECLARED. AND THEN

02:48:06.276 --> 02:48:07.076
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE ARE

02:48:07.143 --> 02:48:09.412
CONTINUING NEED WE HAVE I THINK

02:48:09.479 --> 02:48:10.647
WORKED WITH ONE PARTICULAR

02:48:10.713 --> 02:48:12.649
COUNTY IN IT PROBABLY WAS AFTER

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:14.784
THE CINEMA FIRES WHERE THE

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:16.219

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:32.302
ALTERNATE SETTINGS. THAT WAS

02:48:32.368 --> 02:48:34.003
ALSO NOTED IN THE CINEMA FIRE

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:37.106
WHERE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:38.341

RELOCATED TO EITHER SHELTERS

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:42.812
SOMEWHERE IN LIBRARIES. OR

OTHER ALTERNATE SITES AND TO

02:48:45.215 --> 02:48:47.517
THE EXTENT THAT THE FACILITY

02:48:47.584 --> 02:48:49.018
STAFF CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THOSE

02:48:49.085 --> 02:48:50.487
INDIVIDUALS AND CONTINUE TO

02:48:50.553 --> 02:48:51.354
DELIVER CARE WE WERE ABLE TO

02:48:51.421 --> 02:48:53.857
GET FUNDING FOR THAT. WE ARE I

02:48:53.923 --> 02:48:56.359
THINK PURSUING A CHANGE TO OUR

02:48:56.426 --> 02:48:58.795
STATE PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

02:48:58.862 --> 02:49:01.498
SERVICES AND DECLARED DISASTERS

02:49:01.564 --> 02:49:03.099
TO BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF THE

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:05.668
CLINIC SHOULD THE CLINIC BE

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:08.071
TAKEN OFFLINE AND SO. I THINK.

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:09.839
THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA BEING

02:49:09.906 --> 02:49:11.674
WHAT IT IS AND THE FUTURE BEING

02:49:11.741 --> 02:49:12.475
WHAT IT MOST LIKELY WILL

02:49:12.542 --> 02:49:14.744
CONTINUE TO BE IS THAT WE'RE

02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:15.945
CONTINUING TO KIND OF MAKE

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:18.281
STEPS AND REFINEMENTS. TO ALLOW

02:49:18.348 --> 02:49:19.115
FOR THOSE PROCESSES TO OCCUR

02:49:19.182 --> 02:49:21.384
WHEN A DISASTER UNFORTUNATELY

02:49:21.451 --> 02:49:23.720
TAKES PLACE IN SO I THINK.

02:49:23.786 --> 02:49:26.589
WE'RE HOPING NOT TO USE IT BUT

02:49:26.656 --> 02:49:27.090
WE ARE WE'RE TAKING THE

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:31.261
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO ADDRESS IT.
