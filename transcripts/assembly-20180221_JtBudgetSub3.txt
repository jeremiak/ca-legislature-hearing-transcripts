GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'D LIKE CALL THE. FIRST HEARING OF THE ASSEMBLY SUBCOMMITTEE ON RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO ORDER. AND DEBT AS WITH EVERY YEAR THIS YEAR IS SHAPING UP TO BE A BUSY ONE AND. TODAY WILL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST LOOK AT FIRE PREVENTION FOLLOWING ANOTHER. TORRENTIAL WILDFIRE SEASON. A BUT WE WILL ALSO THIS SESSION BE LOOKING INTO A FEW OTHER THINGS INCLUDING. FLOOD PREVENTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THE EVENTS AT ORACLE DAM LAST YEAR. REVISITING TOXIC CLEAN UP EFFORTS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL AND IN PARTICULAR THE FORMER EXIDE BATTERY PLANTS. AND THE CLEANUP EFFORTS IN THAT COMMUNITY. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND QUITE POSSIBLY GIVEN THE STATE OF OUR SNOW PACK AND RECORD LOW RAINFALL EMERGENCY DROUGHT RESPONSE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES WITHOUT. ADEQUATE WATER SUPPLIES. WE'LL LOOK AT SKYROCKETING NUMBERS OF WHALE ENTANGLEMENTS ALONG OUR COAST AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. RESPONSE AS WELL AS DEVELOP PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT ALLOW OUR CRAB FISHERY TO THRIVE. AND SO I WILL TAKE A LOOK A PROTECTING AN IMPROVING THE HABITAT FOR ASSEMBLY THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED FOR TOO LONG. ARE A STEEL HEAD AND SALMON FISHERIES AS WE HEAD INTO THIS YEAR ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STEEL HAD POPULATION MOST PEOPLE. THAT. DON'T THINK OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE IS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STILL HAD POPULATION THAT POPULATION IS IN PERIL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AREAS SUCH OF THE AS THE FEATHER RIVER. ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SERIOUS THREATS ALL DUE TO LONG TERM DAMAGES TO OUR RIVER ECOSYSTEMS AND FINALLY WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK INTO AGAIN. AT TO IMPROVING OUR RECYCLING PROGRAMS WHICH IN ITSELF FRANKLY A SEEMINGLY ANNUAL EXERCISE IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT SAW FOLLOWED TO BUY WITH A DANCE WITH OUR SENATE COLLEAGUE SENT TO. OUR AND THE ADMINISTRATION BUT HAS NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CHAT A CHANGE TO A PROGRAM THAT I DON'T THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC KNOWS. IS SLOWLY GOING DOWN SO I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT ISSUE THIS YEAR. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE MAJOR CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL BE HAVING DURING THE COURSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO NOT ONLY WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES. HERE BUT HAVING A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE SENATE THE ADMINISTRATION AS WE NEAR OUR JUNE BUDGET DEADLINE. OKAY GOING BACK TO WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY. AND SPEAKING OF DANCES SIDE IT. THAT. WE HAVE REPEATEDLY I'D LIKE TO START BY READING A QUOTE FROM. A HEARING THIS COMMITTEE HAD. A COUPLE YEARS AGO ON APRIL EIGHTH TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THE QUOTAS ARE CLIMATE CHANGE OUR CLIMATE IS CHANGING AND THIS POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH AND ULTIMATELY OUR WAY OF LIFE OF COURSE HOW QUICKLY AND SEVERELY THIS THREAD IMPACTS US LARGELY DEPENDS ON HOW QUICKLY AND AGGRESSIVELY WE MEET THE CHALLENGE. OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN GHG EMISSIONS WILL BE NECESSARY TO AVOID THE WORST CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. MITIGATION EFFORTS WILL TOUCH NEARLY EVERY ASPECT OF CALIFORNIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE. PLANNING AND INVESTMENT. THAT WAS MY OPENING STATEMENT TO THAT HEARING BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH FOCUSED PRESCIENTLY AT THAT TIME ON ARE CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS. PARTICULARLY IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE HEARING FOLLOWED A NASA STUDY THAT WAS RELEASED JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER AND THAT PREDICTED EXTREME WEATHER PATTERNS AND CAUTIONED THAT EXTREME DROUGHT FOR THE REGION IN THE. DECADES AHEAD WOULD BECOME THE NORM. AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT NOW LAST YEAR GAVE US AN ABUNDANCE OF SNOW IN WHAT FELT LIKE A REPLENISHMENT. OF OUR WATER SUPPLIES. BUT AS WE SIT HERE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FIRST WE ARE AGAIN EXPERIENCING RECORD LOW SNOWPACK AND RAINFALL. AND WE'RE LEFT CONTEMPLATING ANOTHER LONG DROUGHT PERIOD JUST AS NASA PROTECTED THOUGH SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND IN THAT APRIL EIGHTH HEARING WE ALSO LEARNED OF PROJECTIONS BY LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. THAT'S NO WATER IN CALIFORNIA WILL DECLINE BY SIXTEEN PERCENT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT BY TWENTY SEVENTY. AND AN ASTOUNDING FORTY ONE PERCENT BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. FORTY ONE PERCENT FOLKS. THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS THE HEART OF OUR WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM COULD SEE ATTEND A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE AND WATER FLOWS BY TWENTY SEVENTY IN THE MONTHS FROM DECEMBER TO MARCH. AS RAINFALL. REPLACES SNOWFALL. AS A RESULT THERE COULD BE A THIRTY PERCENT DECREASE IN WATER FLOWS FROM APRIL TO JULY. AS THERE WILL NO LONGER BE SNOWPACK MELTING TO PROVIDE WATER IN THE SUMMER MONTHS. WEATHER MODELING SHOWN AT THAT TIME DETAILED THIS TO BE THE SAME FOR MANY OTHER RIVER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST. WELL TODAY WE'RE GOING TO GET AN UPDATE ON THIS MODELING FROM ARE VERY TROUBLING MOTLEY FROM OUR CLIMATE EXPERTS. THE INFORMATION HEARING TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE WILDFIRES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS WELL THE RECOVERY WHERE EFFORTS THAT ARE NOW UNDERWAY AND WHAT THIS ALL MEANS FOR OUR FUTURE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT RECORD BREAKING FIRES AN UNUSUALLY LONG FIRE SYSTEM EVERY YEAR AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR SOMETIME NOW. IN FACT EIGHT OF THE STATE'S MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES OCCURRED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE FIRES LAST YEAR BURNED INTO DECEMBER WHICH IS HISTORICALLY OUTSIDE OF OUR FIRE SEASON. SUFFICE IT TO SAY THE EXTREME AND CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS ARE CONTRIBUTING IF NOT DIRECTLY CAUSING THE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE WITNESSED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. FROM YOSEMITE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TO LAKE COUNTY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND MORE RECENTLY THE FIRES THAT RAVAGED THE COMMUNITIES NAPA SONOMA SANTA BARBARA AND RETURNED COUNTIES WE ARE. UNFORTUNATELY FACING A NEW REALITY. NO DOUBT ARE CHANGING CLIMATE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. OUR POOR FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FURTHER EXACERBATE THE SITUATION AND DECADES OF FIRE SUPPRESSION OF COST FORCE LANCE TO GET TO DANCE MAKING THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LARGE AND DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE FIRES ARE WIDESPREAD. IN EFFECT A MULTITUDE OF AREAS I THINK IT'S TEMPTING TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THIS TODAY BUT TIME IS A CONSTRAINT THE HEARING TODAY'S GOING TO BE. A REALLY A PRIMER I THINK FOR WHAT WILL. BE MANY DISCUSSIONS TO FOLLOW AND THE SUBJECT DESERVES MANY DISCUSSIONS. SOAK UP BEFORE WE. ARE OF BRING UP OUR FOR SPEAKER I'D LIKE TO WELCOME SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON THE OTHER OF FOLKS WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO HEAR THIS IMPORTANT TESTIMONY. A A SENATOR JACKSON IS THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. COMMITTEE OF THAT RIGHT. AND DATA AYE SHE MAY WANT IT. I ADD A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A RECOVERING LAWYERS SWELLS POLITICIAN I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO ADD A FEW WORDS. THE AND AND ALSO IS THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT. COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND ALSO AS THE HOST SENATOR FOR THE NINETEENTH SENATE DISTRICT WHICH WAS THE. LOCATION OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE THOMAS FIRE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO. EXTEND MY WELCOME TO ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND AND DISTINGUISHED GUESTS WHO ARE. HERE WITH US THIS MORNING. I'M. VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S ON GOING WILDFIRE RISK IN A RECAP OF THE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEASON WHICH WAS PROBABLY AMONG OUR WORST. AND AS WAS MENTIONED. WE DO POLITICALLY OF RATIONALLY. LOGICALLY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE A CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE FACT THAT IT HAS CREATED OF THESE EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT HAVE LED TO THE DISASTROUS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND. INDEED MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF LIFE SO. AS WE. FOCUS ON HOW OUR STATE AGENCIES CAO FIRE OH YES CAO RECYCLE ARE PREPARING FOR THE NEXT FIRESTORM. OF WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO IN AND MUST DO SO IN AN URGENT FASHION. HEIGHT DO THOUGH HAVE HAVE TO. GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO OUR OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND OUR STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS CAL FIRE OH YES. AND CARRY CYCLE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY JOB THAT THEY HAVE DONE BOTH IN TERMS OF A FIGHTING. OF THESE WILDFIRES AND THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO RECOVER FROM THEM AND I CAN SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO. LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE. DEBRIS FLOWS MUDSLIDES WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM I TOOK THE LIVES OF FIVE. TWENTY THREE PEOPLE TWENTY ONE THAT WE KNOW PASSED AWAY IN A TWO YEAR OLD AND A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO'S. A BODIES HAVE A YET TO BE FOUND. AND IT IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT IRONIC THAT ON DECEMBER FOURTH OF LAST YEAR. I JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER WE CONCLUDED OUR JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING ON EMERGENCY. WARNING SYSTEMS. RECOGNIZING THAT DURING THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES WERE FORTY THREE LIVES UP WERE LOST THAT THE SYSTEM. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THAT ARE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE IS FORTY YEARS OLD PROBABLY PREDATES MOST OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE SEE TODAY. AND THE FACT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO GIVEN THAT THE REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE WEATHER WAS THAT WE'RE SEEING. A NEED TO UPGRADE THOSE SYSTEMS AN HOUR AND A HALF LITERALLY AFTER BANGING DOWN THE GAVEL THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED. WHICH OF RICK TABACUM MY DISTRICT FOR FORTY DAYS. ARE AS THAT FIRE BURNED ACROSS THE WORLD THEA FROM EAST TO WEST IN MY DISTRICT STARTING AND SANTA PAULA. AND ENDING IN SANTA BARBARA A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FORTY MILES AWAY DURING WHICH TIME I WAS PERSONALLY EVACUATED FROM MY HOME FOR SIX DAYS. ARE AND. WATCHED SOMETHING THAT WE WORD THAT WAS VIRTUALLY OUT OF CONTROL MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT. COULD HAVE COST AN EVEN GREATER LIFE THAN IT DID. SO. ULTIMATELY THE FIRE BURNED TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES IN DECEMBER. THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY ARE DESTROYED MORE THAN A THOUSAND BUILDINGS. ENDED ITSELF THE FIRE ALONE CLAIM TO LARGE INCLUDING A CAL FIRE ENGINEER WHOSE LIFE WE. ARE HONORED TO MEMORIALIZED. AND THEN OF COURSE JUST WHEN WE THOUGHT THINGS WERE COMING DOWN PEOPLE HAD MOVED BACK INTO THEIR HOMES. WE WERE BREATHING A COLLECTIVE SIGH OF RELIEF. AS THE FIRE WAS PUSHED INTO THE BACK COUNTRY AWAY FROM OUR CITIES AND RESIDENTS. THE RAINS CAME. THIS IS THE RAINY SEASON THIS IS THE TIME WHEN WAS POST EVERY THIS IS A TIME WHEN WE NEED RAIN. UP PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT WHERE THE LAST OF THE EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS AREAS IN THE STATE WE ARE STILL IN EXTREME DROUGHT. AND SO HERE WE ARE TODAY. WANTING RAIN BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THE HILLSIDES BEHIND THE ENTIRE CITY OF BEEN COMPLETELY DENUDED. AND THIS ARE A NIGHTMARE CURRENT AT THREE THIRTY IN THE MORNING WHEN MOST PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WERE FAST ASLEEP. A A RAIN SHELL ó LANDED OVER MONUS SETO CALIFORNIA. IN WITHIN THE COURSE OF FIVE MINUTES HALF AN INCH OF RAIN FELL. A THAT THAT LED TO MUDSLIDES THE COSTS LARGE AS I MENTIONED OF TWENTY THREE OF MY NEIGHBORS. OF SOME OF THE OFWHOM I KNEW. SO. IT'S PERSONAL IT'S PROFESSIONAL IT IS IN A A REMINDER OF THE IMPACTS OF THESE FIRES IN THESE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THE. TOP OF THE STATE DOWN THE SAN DIEGO. AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN AND OF COURSE THESE WILDFIRES AND AS WELL AS THE MUD. MUD FLOWS DEBRIS FLOWS. AND I HAVE HAD AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS ITS IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE. HIGHWAY ONE A ONE ONE OF TO NORTH SOUTH ROADS A KEY HIGHWAYS AND STAY CALIFORNIA WAS CLOSE FOR TEN DAYS. CREATING HAVOC ON THE ECONOMY OF OUR STATE SO. I I JOIN WITH SO MANY OTHERS TO THANK THE HEROISM OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY MERCHANTS IN PERSONNEL ABOUT BATTLED THE THOMAS FIRED THE TUBS FIRE THE ATLAS FIRE THE NUNS FIRE AND ALL THE OTHER FIRES. THAT HAVE RAVAGED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK. THESE EVENTS WOULD ALL BEEN MUCH MORE CATASTROPHIC BUT IT IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE WHEATON ME WE MUST WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. WE KEEP WORKING I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET UP. THE LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON TO RECOGNIZE THE OTHER CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IF WE'VE GONE BEYOND THE TIPPING POINTS. A OF FOR CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE GOT TO BE PREPARED AND EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T. OF MOTHER NATURE IS MAKING IT VERY CLEAR TO US RIGHT NOW. THAT. SHE IS IN CHARGE AND UNLESS WE WORK WITH MOTHER NATURE OF THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE QUITE DAM SO I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN BLOOM. FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL DISCUSSION.

AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA'S THE STATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY MANY DISASTERS FOR MOST RECENTLY THE FIRES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION TO SEE HOW WE BETTER PREPARE AND PLAN AHEAD FOR THE NEXT SEASON SO TO SPEAK. WHETHER IT'S THE FIRES THE FLOODS AND WE ALSO. TALK ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE WHEN NAY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AS WELL. SO I JUST LOOK AT HOW WE CAN LEARN FROM THESE PREVIOUS DISASTERS HOW CAN BETTER IMPROVE. AND JUST A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OF FIRST RESPONDERS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA FOR DOING. TREMENDOUS JOB IN YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT US IN CALIFORNIA SO ON A THANK YOU.

OF THAT HAVING BEEN SAID TO DISCUSS. THAT THOMAS FIRE AND MORE I'D LIKE TO. INTO INTRODUCE AND WELCOME OUR FIRST SPEAKER CHIEF CAN PIMLOTT THAT DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU PAT CHAIRS BLOOMING AND JACKSON AND MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. FIRST OF ALL AND REPRESENTS REALLY ALL OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS. IN CALIFORNIA AND OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHO RESPONDED. TWO WAYS YOU'VE VERY WELL DESCRIBED. WERE CONDITIONS OF AB EPIC PROPORTIONS LAST YEAR. AS. CHAIR BLOOM INDICATED WE'VE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. ALMOST EVERY YEAR. IN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AS WE'VE. TOGETHER LIVE THE CHANGES THAT HAVE GONE ON IN IN CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO THE CLIMATE AND THE IMPACT THAT IT'S HAD. ON ON FIRES ON WATER SUPPLIES OVER THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING. PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE AND JUST WHEN WE HAVE. SIGNIFICANT YOU'RE LIKE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WITH THE RIM FIRE AND THINK HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY GET WORSE TO HUNDRED AND. FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. OF FOREST LAND AND NATIONAL PARK LAND OUTSIDE YOSEMITE. BURNED FOLLOWING YEAR WE HAVE THE KING FIRE NO THE ROUTE OF COUNTY JUST EAST OF HERE WHICH WAS ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. THREATENING WATERSHEDS IN AND AROUND UP AGAINST LAKE TAHOE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE HAVE SOME OF THE WORST AND MOST DEVASTATING FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY BETWEEN THE BUTTE FIRE. IN CALAVERAS AND AMADOR COUNTY AND THEN THE VALLEY FIRE. IN. LAKE COUNTY. AGAIN LIVES WERE LOST. BURNING UNDER RATES OF SPREAD IN CONDITIONS CONSUMING VEGETATION AT UNLIKE FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS HAVE HAVE SEEN BEFORE. IN THEN LITERALLY TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THIS WAS THE YEAR YOU KNOW FOLLOWING AB SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL WE HAVE BE IT FOR THE MOST PART HAD DECLARED AND TO. THE WORST DROUGHT IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. BUT WHAT CAME WITH THAT I JUST AS YOU INDICATED YOU KNOW THE CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS IT IS JUST. JUSTICE WERE EXPERIENCING TODAY AS WE TREND BACK TOWARDS. WHAT APPEARS TO BE DROUGHT LIKE CONDITIONS AGAIN EXCUSE ME? OUT WHERE WE SAW. A CHANGE IN PRECIPITATION PATTERNS IT'S COMING IN THE FORMS OF RAIN. NOT SNOW WHAT THAT PRODUCED FOREST'S IN. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WAS A RECORD. GRASS CROP THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THERE WAS WITH THE FLASHY FUELS THAT'S THE KINDLING THAT STARTS. MR RECEPTIVE FUEL BABBLE THAT'S WHAT WE STARTED OFF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH. ABOUT ONCE. THE RAIN SUBSIDED AND THE GRASS DRIED OUT THAT WE HAD NOT ONLY LIGHT FLASHY FUELS BUT WE HAD. HEAVY BRUSH WE HAD TREES ALL OF WHICH HAD NOT RECOVERED FROM FIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT. AND BY MAY WE WERE LITERALLY A OFF TO THE RACES WITH. FIRES BURNING THROUGH THE FOOTHILLS THAT WE WERE ALREADY EXCEEDING. AT THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE FOR ACRES BURNED AND THE NUMBER OF FIRES. AND BY FOURTH OF JULY. WE WERE RIGHT AND IT'S A BIT ANECDOTAL BUT I'VE I FELT FOR A WEEK ABOUT A DURING THE FOURTH OF JULY WEEK WE WERE EXPERIENCE IT SEEMS LIKE A A NEW FIRE EVERY TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES. IT WAS LITERALLY AT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT WOULD GET SOME VERY VERY BUSY DAYS. SO GOING INTO AUGUST. WE THE STATE WAS WELL AHEAD OF THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE IN WELL AHEAD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. OUR AVERAGE BOTH IN ACRES BURNED. AND. IN THE NUMBER OF FIRES AND WE'RE TALKING BY OVER THOUSAND. FIRES AHEAD OF THE FIVE YEAR AVERAGE. WE OFTEN LOOK TO THE FALL MONTHS TO SEE WHETHER CONDITIONS. START TO TO SUBSIDE THE DAYS GET SHORTER HUMIDITY IS COME UP AT NIGHT. BUT HISTORICALLY OCTOBER. IT WE WE'VE HAD THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THAT IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. DURING THOSE SET THOSE FALL MONTHS SO WE ARE OFTEN. THE PUBLIC CAN BE LURED INTO THINKING THAT MAYBE FIRE SEASONS OVER THE DAYS ARE COOLER. BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS YOU KNOW. UP PROVE TO BE JUST THAT. WE HAD A WEEKEND. THE FIRST FULL WEEKEND IN OCTOBER. ABOUT RED FLAG CONDITIONS. KNOWS ARE FOR CRITICALLY DRY. HUMILITY'S AND FOUR WINS. THAT EXCEED NORMAL. PATTERNS. THAT'S WHAT WE EXPERIENCED. IN THE NORTH BAY FIRES AS THEY BROKE OUT. ABOUT NINE THIRTY HERE SO THAT SUNDAY EVENING. IN EARLY OCTOBER YEAH AND YES WE'VE HAD NORTH WINS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THOUGH DID THEY. FIRE IN EAST BAY HILLS. IN THE EARLY NINETIES THE TUNNEL FIRE THAT DESTROYED SO MANY HOMES AND AND TOOK LIVES. BURN UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN ALL OF THESE FIRES INCLUDING. THOSE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN OCTOBER IN THE NORTH BAY IS THAT IT'S THAT THE INTENSITY. IT'S THE DURATION OF THE OF THE CONDITIONS AND OF THE FIRESTORM THAT WE'RE SEEING. IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE HAPPENING WOULD BE SIDE SOME CASES RECORDED WINS. ARE IN EXCESS OF EIGHTY MILES AN HOUR. IN A NUMBER OF. WEATHER STATIONS ACROSS TO THE NORTH A PART OF THE STATE. BUT WE HAD OBVIOUSLY MULTIPLE FIRES AT STARTING AT THE SAME TIME. BUT IN A A FORTY EIGHT HOUR PERIOD BEGINNING THAT SUNDAY. EVENING THROUGH THE FOLLOWING MONDAY. AT NIGHT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE TUESDAY MORNING THAT THE NORTHERN REGION OF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORTH OF SACRAMENTO. EXPERIENCED OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TO FIRE STARTS. JUST IN THAT PERIOD WE JUST IN OUR COMMAND CENTER. INSANE HALINA WHICH. RESPONSE TO IMPROPRIETIES HIS CALLS FOR FIRES IN THAT REGION AROUND A CINNAMON LIKE NAPA COUNTIES RECEIVED OVER THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED. EMERGENCY CALLS FOR SERVICE AND THIS IS ON TOP OF. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE FIRE SERVICE AGENCIES IN AND AROUND SO NO MATTER. NAPA MEN TO SEE NO. SOLANO A NEVADA BUTTE. YUBA COUNTIES ALL OF THESE COUNTY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAL FIRE WERE ALL EXPERIENCING. STREAM NUMBER OF CALLS AND SOME OF THE FOR THE FIRST. TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF THE FIRESTORM. IN OCTOBER. ARE LITERALLY. FIRST RESPONDERS PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND MANY OTHERS. WERE LITERALLY FOCUSING ON EVACUATING AT RESIDENTS FROM OUT IN FRONT OF THE FIRE. THE TUBS FIRE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT STARTED. WELL NORTH AND EAST OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA NEARLY TOOK ONLY FOUR HOURS FROM THE TIME IT STARTED UNTIL IT CROSSED. HI WE WANT ONE AND ENTERED THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND LITERALLY BURNED. YOU KNOW TWO MILES INSIDE IN URBAN SUBDIVISION NOT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE BUT IN URBAN. SUBDIVISION OP MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SO THE CHALLENGES WITH AT NOTIFICATIONS AND AND GETTING FOLKS OUT. ALL OF US THAT RESPONDED TO THAT WERE FOCUSED ON LITERALLY PUTTING. TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY PUTTING HIM IN FIRE ENGINES IN PATROL CARS AND LEGALLY DRIVING THEM. TO HOSPITALS THIS WASN'T THE NORMAL CALL NINE ONE ONE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE AND WHAT SHOWS UP AND WE PROCESS IN TRIAGE THE PATIENT AND TRANSPORT THIS WAS. EVERY FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCE WAS TAKING INDEPENDENT ACTION. TO SAVE LIVES UP ALL THE PUBLIC SAFETY DISPATCHERS AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE OF THE HIGHWAY PATROL. CAL FIRE THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS WERE LITERALLY TALKING RESIDENTS THROUGH HOW TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIFE. THEY WERE TYPING IS LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS WHERE THEY WERE DEALING WITH THAT. SO THAT REALLY PAINT THE PICTURE FOR THE FIRST A YOU KNOW TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS. ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW AS THE STATE'S EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WAS QUICKLY OPENED THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE STATE ORGANIZING. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR AND LOOK WHAT WE'VE COME TO BE KNOWN YOU KNOW IS THE SORT OF OF THE THE FOR BETWEEN THAT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES CAL FIRE THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD AND THE HIGHWAY PATROL. JUST SEAMLESS RESPONSE IN APPROACH TO ENGAGING VERY QUICKLY HAPPENED. ON THAT THE VERY NEXT MORNING IN BRINGING IN ALL. OF THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE AND MANY OTHERS TO ENGAGE IN AND TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE WE WERE ABLE TO BRING IN FOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO QUICKLY BRING IN ALL THESE FIRES. UNDER AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE ABOUT WE ENGAGED OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS IN SOME OF THE LOCAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO DEAL WITH MANY OTHER ISSUES THAT OCCURRED THAT WERE SENSITIVE POPULATIONS THAT HAD TO BE. RELOCATED SUCH AS THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER OF THE VETERANS HOME ARE IN YACHT BILL ALL THIS CREATED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WERE WHICH I'M SURE HERE TODAY IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS. BUT ISSUES THAT OCCURRED BECAUSE CELLPHONE INFRASTRUCTURE ABOUT WAS SO DESTROYED A DURING THE FIRES. ALL THESE WERE CHALLENGES THAT POSED. YOU THAT WERE DEALT WITH THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. ULTIMATELY ENGAGING THE STATE'S A MUTUAL AID SYSTEM FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THIS WAS A TEAM EFFORT. THAT INVOLVED STATE FEDERAL LOCAL INVOLVED OUT OVER TWENTY ONE STATES AND THE COUNTRY OF AUSTRALIA RESPONDING LEANING FORWARD TO GET RESOURCES INTO CALIFORNIA. VERY EARLY ON AND JUST AS THE OCTOBER AT FIRES WERE. WE RIGHT IN THE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIGHTING THOSE FIRES ARE NGUYEN DEFENSE FORECAST FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS BIG PICTURE. OF NOT ONLY TAKINGCARE OF THE FIRES WERE FIGHTING IN THE RESPONSE WERE DOING BUT ALSO LOOKING AHEAD TO SEE WHERE OTHER FIRES ARE GOING TO OCCUR AND PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES COMING IN. TO GET THAT DONE AND DIDN'T ULTIMATELY WORKED THROUGH THAT AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING. I'VE LEARNED. IN THIS PROCESS THAT MANY OF US HAVE LEARNED IS THAT THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRE AND EMERGENCY ITSELF IS JUST ONE. HE'S AND I THINK TODAY REALLY TALKING ABOUT MUCH BROADER PEACE THIS TRANSITION TO RECOVERY. IT'S STILL GOING ON OBVIOUSLY HERE ABOUT TODAY FROM THE EXPERTS AND THAT'S THE REAL LEFT HERE IT'S WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARS IT'S MAINTAINING. AND SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE AND GET PEOPLE BACK AND DEAL WITH DEBRIS REMOVAL ALL OF THOSE THINGS. VERY COMPLEX CHALLENGING PROCESS. SO AS WE WORK THROUGH THAT IN OCTOBER. FLASH FORWARD TO AGAIN DECEMBER FOURTH AND SENATE JACKSON. HIT HOME I REMEMBER SITTING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WITH DIRECTOR GELLER DUTY AND MANY OTHERS AND WE INDICATED. THAT LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK TO YOU THIS AFTERNOON THERE ARE RED FLAG CONDITIONS OCCURRING. ON THE CENTRAL COAST IN THE SOUTH LAND. AND YOU KNOW WITHIN HOURS THE THOMAS FIRE BREAKS OUT IN. AT E. AS YOU'VE INDICATED GET A SIMILAR RESPONSE WE BROUGHT RESOURCES IN FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THAT DEALT WITH SOME VERY CHALLENGING AND A VERY CRITICAL URBAN INTERFACE. SITUATION BUT AGAIN MOBILIZE THE RESOURCES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA MOST A THOUSAND FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THEM WERE IMPACTED IN ENGAGED WHETHER COVERING FIRE STATIONS AT HOME. WERE SENDING RESOURCES AUTO TO FIGHT THE FIRE ALONG WITH CAL FIRE. AND OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS A AT THE FOREST SERVICE. ULTIMATELY SIX FIRES IN THAT FIRE SIEGE THAT SPANNED FROM SANTA BARBARA TO SAN DIEGO. AGAIN ENGAGING NOT JUST OUR STATE MILITARY PARTNERS THAT WE DO WORK WITH EVERYDAY BUT ALSO FEDERAL MILITARY ASSETS FROM OUR CAMP PENDLETON. ENGAGING WITH THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS OTHER ASSETS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR. A SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND USING SOME NEW TOOLS. UP BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL OF THIS POINTS TO THAT BUT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND LIVING. FOR THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IS THAT CONDITIONS ARE YEAR ROUND. LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK WERE MOPPING UP AND SPIN AND CONCUR FINISHING CONTAINMENT ON A TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ACRE FIRE. IN THE OWENS VALLEY NEAR BISHOP THAT THREATEN HOMES. AND LIVES OVER THE WEEKEND AND ENGAGED USING RESOURCES THAT ARE NOW HAVING TO BE STAFFED AND DEPLOYED YEAR ROUND. AND THAT'S THE THE REAL CHANGE AND THE REAL FOCUS NOW FROM THE RESPONSE PIECE. THIS IS A YEAR ROUND. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF US SENATE PLACING IMPACTS ON ON ALL OF US WE HAVE SYSTEMS THAT WERE DESIGNED. TO RESPOND TO THE PEAK OF FIRE SEASON AND THEN RESET DURING THE OFF MONTHS BOEING AIRCRAFT ARE FLYING NOW. YEAR ROUND A FIRE ENGINES WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO BRING HIM IN FOR THE FULL MAINTENANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING STAFF BY FIREFIGHTERS. YEAR ROUND WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF FIRE ENGINES STAFF TODAY AROUND THE STATE NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. RUN OF FOLKS THAT ARE OUT SUPPORTING THIS RESPONSE AS WELL ARE ALL THAT IS IMPACTING MAINTENANCE CYCLES A AND AND THE ABILITY TO. TO TO GET THOSE THINGS TAKEN CARE OF. IT IS ALSO. THE IMPACT. ON OUR ABILITY THEN TO DO OTHER WORK BECAUSE WERE RESPONDING WE'RE DEALING WITH THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OUT THERE TO GET DONE AS IT RELATES TO FIRE PREVENTION PA AND OTHER. EFFORTS SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS UP BIG PICTURE AND IT WHERE WE GOING FROM HERE THAT RESPONSE. IS ONE EQUATION AND CALIFORNIA'S. WAS FORTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT. OUR PUBLIC MANY OF THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN URBAN INTERFACE AREAS WHICH IS KNOWN. WELL OBVIOUSLY THE THOMAS FIRE SO MANY COMMUNITIES WERE THREATENED ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST WE ALWAYS NEED A STRONG SYSTEM IN THE STATE BECAUSE WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE. FIRES AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET WORSE SO A HEALTHY STRONG RESPONSE SYSTEM FROM THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. PACK HELLFIRE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND LITERALLY CONTINUING TO KEEP PRESSURE AS YOU INDICATED SENATOR JACKSON. ON OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THEY'RE BRINGING TO THE TABLE THE FEDERAL RESOURCES. TIP TO MEET THAT PART OF IT BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE. WATERSHED LANDS ENFORCED IT LANDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNDER FEDERAL OWNERSHIP. SO THAT'S OBVIOUSLY KEY BUT THE SAME TIME INVESTING IN THESE OTHER ELEMENTS IT'S BEFORE THE FIRE OCCURS AND AS YOU'LL HEAR MORE DETAIL WHAT GOES ON AFTER THE FIRE. OCCURS. BUT I WANNA SPEND THE REST OF MY TIME REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT ARE WE DOING. BEFORE. THE FIRE OCCURS AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH ALL THE THINGS RELATIVE TO FORCED HEALTH FOREST MANAGEMENT. FIRE PREVENTION ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS THIS LEGISLATURE THIS GOVERNOR HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. INCREASED GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDING IN OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED IN FOREST HEALTH. ARE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. BOTH FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FOR FIRE PREVENTION FUELS TREATMENT MOSTLY GOING OUT TO. MANY MANY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE STATE TO ENGAGE IN REAL PROJECTS. ON THE GROUND. TOOK TO REDUCE FUEL LOADING THE INCREASE. FOREST AT RESILIENCE. AND THEN AGAIN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. THE CURRENT THAT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT TO GO FORWARD WITH THOSE VERY VERY SIMILAR. EFFORTS. BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT. TO GET OUR FORESTS BACK TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE TO BE MORE RESILIENT. I NOT HAVE THESE STAND REPLACING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRE RIM FIRES THAT ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OCCUR. TREE MORTALITY THAT'S YOU KNOW NOW CONSUMED O. OVER ALMOST A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES. IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SIERRA THAT HAVE SUCCUMBED. TO AN EPIDEMIC LEVEL OF OF. BARK BEETLE ACTIVITY AND MORTALITY AS A RESULT OF THAT. AS WE TREND BACK INTO DRY CONDITIONS. IT PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SIERRA WE WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO SEE. THE SPREAD OF OF INTENSE LEVELS OF BARK BEETLE ó INCREASE AS IT WORKS ITS WAY TOWARDS A LAKE TAHOE BASIN AND FURTHER NORTH I INTO THE. THE SIERRA THE KEY HERE IS INVESTING USING ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. I KNOW LATER ON THIS MORNING. CHAIR NOVEL WILL TALK ABOUT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT WHICH IS THAT HAS BEEN AN AMAZING JOB. FROM AN EXTERNAL PERSPECTIVE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE STATE FACES AND REALLY. UP PROVIDED THAT DISCUSSION POINT AS TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE GOING IN THAT'S INVESTING. BEFORE THE INSECTS BEFORE THE FIRE. OCCURS SO WE CAN REDUCE. THE VOLUME OF FUEL BEEN OUR FORCE WE CAN CREATE. A HEALTHY RESILIENT FORCIBLE WAS STAND. THESE KINDS OF FIRES THAT'S A MORE NATURAL COMPONENT TO THE FORCE THE CHALLENGES IS. IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THESE URBAN INTERFACE AREA SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR FIRE PREVENTION. AND FUELS TREATMENT IN AROUND COMMUNITIES. AND IN OUR USE OF FIRE OR OTHER TOOLS WITH WHAT WE CAN DO IN OTHER AREAS. OF THE STATE WHERE FIRE CAN BE USED MORE READILY. TO REDUCE FUEL LOADING BUT IT'S A TEAM EFFORT AND IT'S INCREASING BY. NO DOUBT THAT THE PACE AND SCALE BY WHICH WERE USING. PRESCRIBED FIRE. WHAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION AT WORK TO ENSURE? AGAIN THAT WE ARE RELENTLESS IN EDUCATING OUR POPULATION. MANY WHO MOVED TO THESE WILD PLANTS WITHOUT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE THE RISKS THAT THEY'RE IN OUR HOW TO INTERACT IN THE WILD LAND. RIGHTS HOW TO INVEST IN OUR PRIVATE. FOREST LANDOWNERS. ABOUT NINE MILLION ACRES OF THE FOREST LAND IN CALIFORNIA ARE PRIVATE NON INDUSTRIAL. FOREST LAND OWNERS THE USER SMALL FAMILY OWNED IT THE EVAN NINETY PERCENT OF THEM WERE ABOUT FIFTY ACRES WORK FIFTY TO A HUNDRED ACRES. SO. ENCOURAGING ENGAGING PROVIDING THE INCENTIVES WORKING THROUGH. VARIOUS TOOLS TO ENGAGE OUR LANDOWNERS IN TREATING THESE LANDS BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY. NINE MILLION ACRES TREATED MEANS NINE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND THAT'S MORE RESILIENT. THAT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING TO CARBON SEQUESTRATION. THAT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING TO DEVASTATING GOT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DURING CATASTROPHIC FIRES PROTECTING OUR WATERSHEDS ENSURING WATER QUALITY. OUR AIR QUALITY WILDLIFE ALL ASPECTS THAT GO WITH THAT AND THESE THESE ARE PUBLIC LANDS USER INDIVIDUAL. FAMILY LAND OWNERS WHO. JUST NEED THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO AT AND SOME TECHNICAL ADVICE TO HELP MANAGE THEIR LAND. THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THERE'S INVESTMENT BY OUR COMMERCIAL LANDOWNERS AND THERE'S THE FEDERAL LAND OF THAT MAKES UP SO MUCH OF THE FOREST LAND. ALL HAS TO BE DONE TOGETHER. AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THESE LANDSCAPE LEVEL PROJECTS AS WE GO FORWARD SO WE CAN GET SOME REAL WORK. DOWN ON THE GROUND WE CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE WE GOT TO LEVERAGE EVERY. TOOL WE HAVE IN THE TOOLBOX TOGETHER IT'S NOT CAL FIRE WORKING BY ITSELF. THE FOREST SERVICE FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY SEARING ABOUT A CONCERNS IT'S ALL OF US. FINDING THOSE KEY PROJECTS I'M KEY AREAS WHERE WE CAN TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BOB. THE GOVERNOR WHEN DURING THE STATE OF THE STATE. WAS VERY CLEAR. ABOUT THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN FORCE MANAGEMENT AND ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT. TO GET US THERE. AND TO AS THE THE WEEKS GO FORWARD WILL BE HEARING MORE. ABOUT. IT REALLY PIVOTING OUR DISCUSSIONS AT THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE TO A MUCH BROADER DISCUSSION. ARE ON FORCE MANAGEMENT ITSELF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO GET AHEAD OF THIS CHALLENGE AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO MOVING THIS NEEDLE TOGETHER TO MAKE SOME REAL DIFFERENCE IN THE STATE BUT IT'S CLEAR. THAT IF WE DON'T. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE THE LEVEL OF DEVASTATION THAT WE'RE SEEING. BOB THESE CHANGES ARE BEEN OCCUR OVERNIGHT SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR PACE AND SCALE. OF EFFORTS. AT THE SAME TIME WE. SURE THAT OCEAN RISES ALL BOATS ARE AT THE SAME TIME ARE EQUALLY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST. IN ALL PHASES OF THIS SO AS YOU'LL HEAR LATER THE RECOVERY ELEMENTS. BUT CERTAINLY THE RESPONSE PIECES TO FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. TO HAVE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE A IN THE STATE. SO WITH THAT I'M OPEN FOR KIDS. THANK YOU CHIEF. AS ALWAYS IS. GOOD TO HEAR YOUR ABOUT YOUR ANNUAL REPORT. AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME A MS LOW MOAN AND TO MUSIC AND WE ARE CURRY. TO TO THE HEARING THIS MORNING AND TO. ASK A FURTHER ANY QUESTIONS THAT ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ASK BEING MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT TO WE HAVE. TO ADDITIONAL PANELS AND SO WILL. AFTER. IT WE HAVE TO FINISH BY ABOUT NOON SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT PLEASE. UP. SINCE YOU'RE HEARING YOU'RE THE EXPERT ON OF FOREST MANAGEMENT. IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE CHALLENGES. NOT ONLY WITH THE STATE CLEARING THE LANDS THAT IT HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR BUT ALSO WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN PARTICULAR I'M INTERESTED IN. WHAT DOES SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE AS WE ADDRESS BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND THE NONCOMMERCIAL PRIVATELY? OWNED LAND IN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO DO MANAGEMENT. SO THAT WE CAN THEN THE FORESTS ARM. AND HELP AVOID SOME OF THESE CATASTRPHIC ERA FIRESTONE'S. NO IT IN THAT SIR THE KEY AT AND I THINK THAT THE THE. PARTNERS OFTENTIMES AT MAYBE NOT CLEAR FOR THE PUBLIC IS THAT THE STATE AND AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REALLY OWN VERY LITTLE FOREST LAND IN THE STATE. IT'S MOSTLY WITHIN FEDERAL OWNERSHIP AND IT'S MOSTLY. WITHIN PRIVATE OWNERSHIP EITHER LARGER. INDUSTRIAL COMMERCIAL OWNERSHIPS OR THE STUDY ON NON. INDUSTRIAL A FAMILY FOR A STEP OWNERSHIPS AND SO THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY CAL FIRE. WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS. HERE MANY WHOM AREIN THE ROOM. AYE WE'RE WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT WE DON'T CONTROL THE WAY AND THE PRIVATE LAND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO HELP THOSE LANDOWNERS WITH THE TOOLS TO GET THE WORK DONE THROUGH INCENTIVES AND THROUGH TECHNICAL ADVICE. THROUGH COLLABORATION. WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS THE NGOS AND AND THAT NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE TO HELP BRING. BAD LANDOWNER SYSTEMS AND FEDERAL LANDOWNERS SINCE IT'S MONEY OUT TO THE TABLE. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULATING. THE THE FORCE PRACTICES IN THE STATE'S A HARVESTING TIMBER COMMERCIALLY OFF OF PRIVATE LAND. THAT YOU KNOW REQUIRES A A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN AND BE OVER THERE IS A PROCESS THERE SO WE'RE CERTAINLY ENGAGED. IN THE REGULATORY ASPECT BUT IT'S MUCH. IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT THE REAL RESPONSIBILITY IS OUT THERE TO ENSURE WHAT ARE THE INCENTIVES HOW DO WE HELP LANDOWNERS. HELP THEMSELVES. BECAUSE THE. WORKING DOING FUELS TREATMENT ENGAGING IN THE WOODS. IS COSTLY IT'S TIME CONSUMING. AND IT REQUIRES UMPS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIA TO MEET LANDOWNER OBJECTIVES SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF TOOLS. IN THE TOOL BOX TO GET THAT DONE PRESCRIBED FIRE IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THERE. BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY TOOL AND IN MANY OF OUR AREAS OF OUR FORCE CAN'T BE USED. WITHOUT FIRST ENGAGING IN OTHER MECHANICAL TREATMENTS FIRST BECAUSE THE FIRE THE FORCE ARE SO OVERGROWN. THAT PUTTING FIRE EVEN UNDER THE BEST OF CONDITIONS WILL DESTROY THE FORCE SO. IT'S A VARIETY OF TOOLS IT'S THAT THINNING FROM BELOW TO GET THE DEAD FUELS OUT FROM OF THE FOR THE UNDERSTOREY OF THE FORCED. ITS COMMERCIAL TIMBER HARVESTING BECAUSE PART OF THIS PROCESS IS ALLOWING LANDOWNERS TO GET SEPARATE COVER SOME COST OF DOING THE WORK. SO GETTING THAT ABOUT THOSE THOSE THOSE TREES THAT THEY'RE REMOVING OUGHT TO A MIL TO HELP GET RECOVERIES THEY CAN REINVEST THAT. IN MANAGING THEIR FOREST THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE ABOUT THE ABILITY TO HAVE ENOUGH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THE STATE WOOD PROCESSING FACILITIES WHETHER IT IS BIOMASS. TECH TO GENERATE NEW DABNEY ELECTRICITY OR HEAT FROM THE BY PRODUCTS OF OF A FOREST MATERIAL WHAT'S THE SAWMILLS THEMSELVES TO ENSURE THERE IS A. THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT TO SUPPORT THE ECONOMY ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT. AND ENGAGING IN RIGHT NOW FOR GOING TO REALLY INCREASED THE PACE AND SCALE. OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR FORESTS. LIMON. THANK YOU GET TO SEE YOU AND AND I I WANNA ALSO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE BEEN GIVING AS A FIRST TERM LEGISLATOR THERE IS NOTHING LIKE LEARNING ABOUT FIRES AND NATURAL DISASTERS LIKE THE CRASH COURSE THAT AND THINK. THAT THAT I I LIVED IN WE EXPERIENCED. AT. IT IN WERE IN REFLECTING ON AT THE THOMAS FIRE YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE HAD AND I'VE AND HEARING A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE FOREST. THAT FIRE DID NOT START IN THE FOREST. AND. THAT FIRE STARTED YEAH AND VERY CLOSE TO OUR URBAN AREA. AND. IF IT WE IT WITH EVENTUALLY MOVED TO THE LOS PADRES FOREST BUT AND IT DIDN'T START THERE HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT AREAS LIKE THAT. AND ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'RE SHARING WITH US. YOU KNOW TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER AREAS WHERE THE THE START CLOSER TO OUR CITIES TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THEN THEY KIND OF GET PUSHED IN THAT DIRECTION FOR REASONS OF SAFETY. IS IT IS SOME OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS SAME ARE THEY. HE NO DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THAT. VERY GOOD QUESTION SO THE. THE BASIC PREMISE OF FIRE PREVENTION AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND FUELS TREATMENT. APPLIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S YOU KNOW IS A VERY DIVERSE LANDSCAPE. THAT'S VEGETATION GO WE TALK A LOT ABOUT ENGAGING IN OUR OUR FORESTS AND THINNING. IN THE FORESTED COMMUNITIES. BUT SO MUCH OF THE STATE IS IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE WERE BLURRED AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE THOMAS FIRE BURNED WHICH. WASN'T OUT IN A FOREST IT WAS IAN BRUSH SCRUB. INTERFACE HOMES AND SO WHILE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING LESS ABOUT FOREST THINNING THERE AND FOR IN ENFORCED RESILIENCE WERE TALKING. TRULY THERE ABOUT HOW DO WE REDUCE FUEL LOADING. TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF FIRES TO PROTECT HOMES HOW DO WE. PUT FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE OR REALLY. EMPHASIZE THE ONES WE HAVE IN PLACE WENT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER A FIRE. PLEASE NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA ARE STARTED BY PEOPLE. FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS IT YA COME IT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IF PEOPLE START FIRES WE CAN FIND WAYS TO. PREVENT THAT YOU KNOW THROUGH OR REDUCE THOSE STARTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. LOOKING AT DIFFERENT PRACTICES SO. THAT'S A BIG PORTION OF WORKING IN THE URBAN INTERFACE IS HOW DO WE LOOK AT WHAT ARE CAUSES OF FIRES ARE IN THESE AREAS AND AND REALLY TARGET. A EFFORTS AT TOWARDS THAT UP TREATING FUELS A BIG COMPONENT OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION OR CAP AND TRADE. PROGRAM THIS YEAR IS FOCUSING ON WHAT WAS FORMERLY THE FIRE PREVENTION. FUND AND THAT IS WORKING ON PROJECTS IN AND AROUND COMMUNITIES JUST LIKE A IN THE AREA OF SAN APOLLO IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED HOW DO WE. PUTTING FUEL BREAKS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT EVERY HOMEOWNER HAS THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE DOESN'T JUST PROTECT THE HOME OR THE STRUCTURE FROM AN ONCOMING FIRE. IT ALSO PROTECTS THE WILD LAND AND OTHER STRUCTURES FROM A FIRE THAT STARTS ARE IN YOUR HOME OR A VEHICLE FIRE. IT MAY OCCUR OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR SOME OTHER SOURCE AND SO THE BASIC PREMISE OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FUELS TREATMENT AND FIRE PROTECTION. REALLY APPLIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S AS WE GET INTO DIFFERENT FORCED TO COMMUNITIES DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES. RURAL VERSUS URBAN IT'S HOW WE APPLY IT AND IT'S BUT THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WERE DOING. TO HELP REDUCE FUEL LOADING AND PROTECT THAT INDUSTRY. IT IS A QUESTIONS. MS AGUIAR CURRY PUT I JUST HAVE ONE CRAP COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE IT YOU KNOW EXPENSE. A MS LEHMAN SAID IT WAS A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THE BOTH OF US TO HER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE DEALING WITH. MY FRUSTRATION WAS DURING THIS TIME WAS PEOPLE'S LACK OF. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TAKING CARE OF THEIR PROPERTY. AND. I THINK. EDUCATION IS GREAT. BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT ADDED TO SOME OF THE ISSUES AND HOW THE FIRE WENT THROUGH OUR AREA BUT. I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT WE'VE GOTTA WORK ON PERSONAL. RESPONSIBILITY ON THESE AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN. ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THEY CLEAR THEIR AREAS FROM THE HOUSES. ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON AND TO OUT THERE ARE ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES WITHIN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THAT THIRTY ONE MILLION ACRES THAT CAL FIRE. ALONG WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS PROTECT. WE ARE TARGETING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS PER YEAR SO IT. AT A MINIMUM EVERY THIRD YEAR WILL BE RE CONTACTING THE SAME HOMEOWNER NOW UNDERSTAND THAT. IN SOME CASES WHERE WE CONTACT IN THE SAME HOMEOWNER YOU KNOW YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT WE ARE REALLY INCREASING NOT JUST PUTTING MORE FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE ON THE GROUND AND CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO DO MORE. WERE ALSO REALLY CHALLENGING US TO GET OUT AND DO MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION WITH THE HOMEOWNERS YES WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CITATIONS OUR GOAL THOUGH. IS IS TO. HAVE THEM ALL COMPLIANT AND WE START WITH EDUCATION BUT WE ARE. NOT AFRAID TO COME BACK INTO MULTIPLE INSPECTIONS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH NOTICE THAT THEY'RE OUTSIDE OF COMPLIANCE BECAUSE YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. PROTECTION IT STARTS WITH THE HOMEOWNERS THE PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR THEMSELVES. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU CHIEF APPRECIATE AS ALWAYS REPRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THAT. A BUDGET HEARINGS AND IF I MAY JUST. THANK YOU AS WELL IN INDICATE TO THE. BASED UPON A LOT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AND THE TRAUMA OF HAVING GOT LEARN THIS FIRST HAND. RIGHT IN OUR FACES AYE I INTRODUCED A BILL THIS YEAR S. B. TWELVE SIXTY IT'S AN OMNIBUS. TYPE FAR. PREVENTION BILL THAT WE TALK ABOUT CONTROLLED BURN STANDARDS AND AIR. QUALITY OF STANDARDS AND SO FORTH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND THE DEPARTMENT. AND ALL OF THE RELEVANT AGENCIES TO TRY TO. UP PUT INTO SOME POLICY OF IN IN OUR DISTRICT AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELONES DISTRICT MIND. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE OF A GROUP OF A PAGE. OF ARBORIST ETCETERA COME INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND DO THE WORK FOR US. I HAVE TO SAY NOT NECESSARILY AS WELL AS WE MIGHT LIKE BUT AGAIN THESE MIGHT BE THINGS WHERE WE IF WE PROVIDE. THE. LEGISLATIVE. AUTHORITY ARE FOR YOU TO DO THIS WORK US SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF ONE PERSON CHOOSES NOT TO PARTICIPATE. IT MAY IMPACT OTHER PEOPLE AND SO THAT THERE IS THAT PUBLIC RESPONSIBILITY THAT. WE WEIGH IN THE PROCESS AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU THE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION VERY INTERESTED INCIDENT OUT ALL OF YOU AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS IS CRITICAL AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY THANKING EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU I KNOW. BUT IT WAS IT WHERE YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR TIME ALL FALL BUT HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP YOUR INTERACTION WITH ALL OF US OUT THERE THE SUPPORT. WAS PHENOMENAL AND. WE APPRECIATE THAT VERY. GREAT THANK YOU AGAIN WE'RE GONNA PROCEED NOW WITH PANEL NUMBER TWO. WE HAVE. CUT TWO PANELS AND THEN AFTER. CAR AYE AYE AFTER AFTER OUR THIRD PANEL ACTUALLY WE WILL. ENTERTAIN PUBLIC COMMENT. SO I'D LIKE TO ASK A MARK GILLARD YUCHI THE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES STEP FORWARD AS WELL AS CAN TO ROSE OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES RECYCLING IN RECOVERY. AND DOCTOR JOHN PARRIS THE STATE GEOLOGIST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND I BELIEVE EACH OF YOU HAVE A. PRESENTATION TO MAKE. NO. WELCOME EVERYONE OKAY BOOK GOOD MORNING. CHERRY BLOOMING. CHERYL AND JACKSON THE REST OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE GREAT TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING AND. ALL I THINK FROM VERMONT OF WHICH ARE MY STAMP Y. THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE COMING WEEKS THAT ARE GOING TO BE. GOING OVER A LOT OF DETAIL REGARDING THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. FROM THESE VARIOUS CATASTROPHIC GOT WILDFIRES BUT. TODAY I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT. HAD TARGET SOME OF THE RECOVERY OPERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE GREAT WORK THAT. OUR PARTNERS AT CAL RECYCLE AND I CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC SURVEY AND ID TNC HAVE DONE. ALL AS WELL AS CAL FIRE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE. OF APPROACH ALL OF THESE EVENTS AND REALLY I AS I SAY A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT EFFORT AND. AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OR AND AND AND APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE WORK THAT. THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE. BOB I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT START OFF THE THE TO REMIND FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW WHILE WE HAD THESE FIRES. THAT THAT STARTED POT WE ACTUALLY WE'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE WINTER STORM. AYE DISASTERS. IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WHICH ACTUALLY RESULTED IN FOUR SEPARATE PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS AND IN FACT WE WERE. REALLY DALY WITHOUT WITH MAJOR RECOVERY OPERATIONS IN FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THESE. FIRE VENTS HAPPENED IN OCTOBER. IT'S ALSO STAGGERING TO UNDERSTAND THAT REALLY IN THE COURSE OF A FOUR MONTH PERIOD STARTING AROUND. DEL OCTOBER EIGHTH. WE A IN CALIFORNIA LOST. OF A LITTLE OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHICH REALLY SORTS OF FRAMES. THAT THAT THE COMPLEXITY AND THE AND THE EXTREMELY OF OF THESE EVENTS. AND SO ARE GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT TODAY. I WANNA START OFF BEFORE I GET INTO THE RECOVERY JUST HIGHLIGHTING A FEW NUMBERS FOR YOU ALL WHICH I THINK IS. IS INTERESTING TO NOTE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THE NUMBER. WAS STAGGERING GOT CLOSE TO EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED STRUCTURES THAT WERE YOU THERE RIDE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED THAT'S THAT'S HOMES AND BUSINESSES. HERE THERE WERE OVER TWENTY FOUR WAS THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO REGISTERED FOR ASSISTANCE IN NOW. AND IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BAND OVER CLOSER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND. IN. AYE INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT FUNDING WAS WAS PROVIDED TO THESE INDIVIDUALS UP FOR VARIOUS REASONS ARE AND AND AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN HOUSING ASSISTANCE WHETHER IT WAS A DIRECT LEASE HOUSING OR. GET GETTING THEM INTO SOME SORT OF HOTEL OR LONG TERM IN TERM SORT OF SOLUTION. WHICH IS STILL AN ONGOING PROCESS TODAY. AS WE WORK THROUGH THAT. SP A. PROVIDED. THROUGH COORDINATED EFFORTS. BETWEEN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER IN AND OUT AND FEE ABOUT A CLOSE TO A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN GRANTS. AND LOANS TO. BUSINESSES WITHIN THE AREA ARM AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE. OPERATIONS ESTABLISHED. IN VARIOUS. FAIRGROUNDS AND OTHER KINDS OF SITES WERE REPORTING AND. LA MOBILE HOME UNITS OR. RECREATIONAL VEHICLES SOMETHING LIKE ACTION OF A FIFTH WHEEL OR TRAVEL TRAILER. TO GET PEOPLE INTO THESE. INTERIM HOUSING ARE IN IT IN AN AREA NORTH OF CALIFORNIA THAT. REALLY WAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF HOUSING AVAILABILITY PRIOR TO THE FIRE HAPPENING SO REALLY PRESENTED A SERIES OF. OF CHALLENGES FOR US IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF COURSE A ANOTHER SERIES OF EVENTS. TOOK PLACE. ALSO RESULTED IN OF OF PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATION. RESULTING IN CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND AYE IT CALIFORNIANS IN THIS OUT SOUTH REGISTERING. CLOSE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN. INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE DISBURSEMENT AND OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND HOUSING. ASSISTANCE ARE ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN S. B. A. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN RECOVERY AYE WE SAY THAT THE RECOVERY YOU KNOW IS RESPONSIBLE COVER REALLY BEGINS TO GATHER WHAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE. RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IMMEDIATELY WHILE WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE RESPONSE A CHEAP PEN WHAT THAT A GREAT JOB IN TALKING ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE APPROACH CALIFORNIA IT THROUGH A UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP ARE AND AND THE LEADERS OF OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES COMING TOGETHER AS AS ONE TEAM. OUGHT TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS EARLY ON AND PUT OUR METRICS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD PATHWAY. PERSISTS FOR SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT DOUBT WE WERE CHECKED HIT WITH SOME EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SITUATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES. OUT WITH SOMETHING LIKE WE HAD NOT SEEN. TO THE DEGREE IF THE SKY THE SCALE THE SCOPE. ARE OUT OF AN EVENT. AND AND THESE THIS THIS AMOUNT OF DEBRIS ARE AND WE KNOW THAT TACTIC BEGIN THAT RECOVERY PROCESS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO GET THE DEBRIS CLEARED OUT OF A COMMUNITY THAT'S THAT'S. GOTTA BE JOB ONE AS WELL AS GETTING PEOPLE INTO OF OBVIOUSLY. SAFE AND SECURE OUR HOUSING SO. BUT WHEN YOUR WEIGHT WEIGHT WHEN YOU'RE FACED WITH THE AMOUNT OF UP OF BOB BLOCKS THAT WE WE WERE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT WAS A COMPLEX DOT BEING. CAST IT WASN'T JUST IN US AND AU MA MENDOCINO OR LAKE IN NAPA BUT WE ALSO WERE AND YUBA. NEVADA. BUTTE AND PLOW SIR AND SO OUR ROLE. IT'S PART OF THE DEFY COORDINATION GROUP AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WAS TO MAKE A STRATEGIC DECISION ON HOW BEST WE COULD COLLECTIVELY EAT THIS ELEPHANT AS A WHOLE. AND BEING ABLE TO GO IN AND RAPIDLY MOVE FORWARD TO DEAL WITH. THE DEBRIS CLEARANCE HOW EARLY ON I SET SOME RELATIVELY. STRINGENT. METRICS THAT THAT WE WANTED TO GET THESE COMMUNITIES CLEANED UP TURNED TO OUR PARTNERS A CAL RECYCLE. CAO RECYCLE AND DEPARTMENT TALKED ACCEPTED PATROL. HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL OUR PARTNERS AND WE ASK THEM TO DO A LOT. IN BEING ABLE TO GO OUT AND AND WORK ON DEBRIS OCCURRENCE OPERATIONS. NINETY PERCENT OF THE FIRES THAT WE DEAL WITH THAT THAT RESULT IN STRUCTURAL LOSS IN THE STATE. THAT ARE BEYOND THE CAPABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT BELOW THE ABILITY TO GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE FALL WHAT I CALL TWEETERS IT'S A STATE RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO WE TURN TO CAL RECYCLE A LOT TO GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO DO THESE DEBRIS CLEARANCE OPERATIONS. UP WE MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT WE WOULD SPLIT. THE REQUIREMENTS AND DOWN THE NORTHERN. COUNTIES OF OF OF BEAUTY AND. AYE NEVADA AND YUBA IMPOSTER WOULD BE HANDLED BY IDT S. IN CAL RECYCLE AND THE OTHER COUNTIES. AND. SONO MOB. LAKE NAPA AND MENDOCINO WE WOULD TURN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HAVE FEMALE TASK THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. TO BRING IT RESOURCES UNDER THEIR CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO TO. BEGIN THAT PROCESS WE WOULD SET THE METRICS IN THE REQUIREMENTS AND THAT WE WOULD WORK TOGETHER. BUT ALL THROUGH THAT PROCESS OUT BY REPRESENTATIVES OF OF OUR COUNTY CYCLE IN THE TNC WORK CLOSELY WITH ALLIES. AND THE COURT ENGINEERS TO SET THE REQUIREMENTS EVERYTHING FROM CONTRACTING TO. STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT NEEDED TO BE MET BUT DTS SEE. AND THEIR PARTNER A U. S. EPA I HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOING IN AND CLEARING OUT ALL OF. THE HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PAINS AND PESTICIDES AND PROPANE AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF. THAT NEED TO BE CLEAR BEFORE WE COULD ACTUALLY BEGIN THE DEBRIS OPERATION THAT IN ITSELF WAS A MONUMENTAL TASK. FOLLOWING THAT WE RAPIDLY MOVED IN TO START THE DEBRIS OPERATIONS AND AND. I CAN WILL TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW HOW THEY GOT THE THAT THEY DID THAT. AND YOU KNOW A REALLY IN NAM IN THE CASE OF OUR. OF YOU BUT A BUTTE NEVADA. OVER SIXTY THREE THOUSAND TONS OF DEBRIS WILL OVERHAUL THE WAY. IN THE SHORT TIME FRAME THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE THE RESPONSE WE NEEDED TO DO THAT. ARM AND A LEG UP NAPA SONOMA MENDOCINO WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT THE PRECLEARANCE I HAVE A GRAPHIC HERE THAT. I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT. REALLY SOME OF THE PICS. THE. I COME TO TALK ABOUT IT IN NUMBERS IF YOU LOOK AT THIS. THIS GRAPHIC YOU CAN SEE THAT. MORE THAN ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS HAS BEEN REMOVED. THAT EQUALS ALMOST ONE AND ALL WILL THAT MORE THAN HALF OF. US SECOND GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE HE PUTS IT IN THE CONTEXT OF HOW MUCH DEBRIS WERE ACTUALLY MOVING. UP THROUGHOUT THE THE. FIVE COUNTY AREA AND. THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN REALLY. OR NOW SEVENTY NINE PERCENT COMPLETE WE'RE GONNA MEET THE METRIC THAT WE'VE SET FORTH. AND IT IS NOT BEEN WITHOUT. ON A SERIES OF CHALLENGES AND AND DOW. AND THAT WHAT I CALL LABOR OF LOVE. TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT THAT THAT CHART DOESN'T COMPUTE FOR ME CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY SANTA MONICA APPEARS THAT WOULD PAY. I'M SORRY THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD. I WILL I'LL MAKE ONE FOR YOU. THAT'S ESTA. SO. TO THE STATE OVER FORTY HUNDRED PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN CLEARED. THERE'S THERE'S A LESS THAN A THOUSAND REMAINING A LEGACY SEVENTY NINE PERCENT AND THIS IS BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX. AND CHALLENGING DEBRIS OPERATIONS WE FAX CERTAINLY BEEN THE BIGGEST TO PRE OPERATION THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAD SINCE SINCE THE NINETEEN OH SIX EARTHQUAKE AND OUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE REQUIREMENT OF REMOVING DEBRIS. I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR UP WITH WITH ALL OF YOU. OUR STATE LEGISLATORS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I EVERYBODY COMING TOGETHER. IN THAT PLENTY ONE FIGHT EFFORT. IT WAS REALLY THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA. SO. THAT'S KIND OF A RAP ON THAT ON THE ON THE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND. HOW WE WILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD? AND WE WILL ALSO MAKE SURE THAT DOWN I MEAN I I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN COFFEE PARK. THEIR ARTIST THEY'RE PUTTING STICKS UP THERE THEY'RE BUILDING THE HOMES ALREADY IN IN THAT AREA AND THAT IS REALLY A PHENOMENAL THING. THEN IN NOW IN DECEMBER OF COURSE SUCH A PADLOCK TALKED ABOUT THE FIRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN FACT WELL WE WERE AS CHEAP THAT MUCH SAID TO HIM AND I WERE WERE TESTIFYING IN IN FRONT OF A HEARING WITH SENATOR JACKSON. WHEN WHEN THAT NIGHT THE FIRES BROKE OUT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE LEFT THE HEARING AND HAD A FEW HOURS HERE AND THAT WE WERE ANA. HELICOPTER SOUTH. TO BE ABLE DO THAT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND OUR. THE FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS LOOK UNPRECEDENTED WE WERE ROUGHLY THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE WAS UNDER RED FLAG CONDITIONS. ARE REQUIRED AS TO ACTUALLY PROMPTED AS ACTUALLY PUT A. UNDERWEAR MESSAGE OUT TO TWELVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE EIGHT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. TO TO BE AWARE. OF THE CONDITIONS BUT IN REALITY WE HAD FIRES THAT BROKE OUT IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THREATENING THE GETTY AND AND PARTS AT UCLA. AND LA COUNTY NINE CA DIEGO. INVENTOR AND OF COURSE IN SANTA BARBARA. AND. THAT THAT ALL OF ALL THOSE FIRES THE BIGGEST UP OBVIOUSLY IT WAS THE THOMAS FIRE AND. IT WAS IT'S THE BIGGEST NOW TO DATE IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. ARE ALL OF THOSE OF COURSE RESULTED IN AYE AYE AN ADDITIONAL. FIFTEEN HUNDRED OR SO STRUCTURES LOST. IN ALL OF THOSE FIRES AND UP AND AGAIN WE WE WERE LOOKING AT THE. AT THE TIME REALLY THE FOCUS WAS IT SAN DIEGO COUNTY WAS. WAS WHAT WAS VERY WELL EXPERIENCE BUT THE NUMBER STRUCTURES THEY WERE GOING TO HANDLE THEIR OWN. WORKING WITH EYES. TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR DEBRIS. OPERATIONS BUT DEVON TARA. WAS A BIT MORE UP COMPLEX AND AND. AND AND. WAS A HEAVY LIFT FOR THEM AND SO IN THIS CASE AGAIN WE TURN TO CAL RECYCLING DTS SEE. ARE AND THEY MOVE FORWARD TO A RAPIDLY MOVE FORWARD I WOULD SAY. TO TO JUMP IN AND BEGIN THE PROCESS AND TO THIS DAY. CAO RECYCLE IS HANDLING THE. DEBRIS REMOVAL INVENT BETTER COUNTY. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX PARCELS HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND AND. DATA I'LL CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED UP PARCELS ARE ALREADY COMPLETE AND THAT. THERE'S ANOTHER CHART HERE THAT THE TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THE COMPLEX IS ONE IS THE. MOST THESE HOMES THE MIDDLE PARTICULARLY THE PIT DEPENDING IF THEY'RE THEY'RE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY HAVE ASBESTOS ARE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO. TAKE THE CLEAR THROUGH ITS NOT JUST MOVING HOUSE WILL HOW DOES WASTE BUT IT'S CLAIMING THAT IT'S BEST IS BEFORE WE CAN MOVE IN AND EVERY MOVE THOSE THOSE. BUT THE BRIE. AND. AND AND THIS CHART DISH JUST REITERATE WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE THE NUMBER OF PARCELS APPROVED AND THE NUMBER. THAT HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE AND END UP AGAIN THE METRICS THERE. ARE THAT. THERE THAT THIS WILL BE COMPLETE AND AND PROBABLY EARLY APRIL AND DOW AT THIS POINT. EVERYTHING IS IN IN LINE TO COMPLETE THOSE. METRICS. THEN OF COURSE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THAT LAST BIG PUSH A FIRE ACTIVITY. ON THE THOMAS FIRE AND I MEMBER THAT WEEKEND. WAS VERY. VERY STRESSFUL WHEN THE WHOLE STATE WAS REALLY IN THIS RED FLAG AND. THE FIRE CAME DOWN VERY CLOSE INTO IMPACT PART SOME OF MODEST YOU KNOW IN IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND AND. BURNED COMPLETELY AROUND ALL HIGH AND IT WAS REALLY IF YOU KNOW PHENOMENAL FIREFIGHT THAT TOOK PLACE. THE FIRE FIGHTERS AND AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL LAFORTUNE PHENOMENAL JOB. THE PROBLEM WAS IS THAT. THE AREA ABOVE SANTA BARBARA. WHICH IS MOSTLY LOS PADRES NATIONAL FOREST LIBERTY WAS DENUDED OF ALL WATERSHED. AND THAT SET UP A DYNAMIC. THAT IF IT WE HAD ANY RAIN. ALL OF THAT ALL OF THAT THAT. THE BREED IT WAS THERE THAT ASH THAT THAT AND THE EXPOSURE OF THE MY WITH NO WATERSHED TO CAPTURE WATER. COULD RESULT IN. CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. NOW. WE KNEW THIS AND. CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC SURVEY THE U. S. G. S. CAL FIRE A NUMBER OF OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS. CAO POINT PART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ALL COMING TOGETHER. COORDINATED THROUGH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TO GO IN AND DO ASSESSMENTS BEFORE. BUT ANY FLOODING PARTICULAR PLACE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF HIGH RISK. WHERE DOT WE ANTICIPATED HOW IT IN PLANNING TO BOB BE ADVANCED AND AND PREPARE FOR THAT? AND IN FACT. YOU HOPE THAT NO RAIN HAPPENS COURSE YOU KNOW HOW MURPHY IS. WE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS A STORM BREWS HAVE HAD A STORM IT'S AT A BARBER IN. A SUPER LONG TIME EXCEPT NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A STORM IN SANTA BARBARA AND IT'S GOT A TARGET RIGHT ABOVE MINE ACETO. SO YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP SO. THE BOTTOM LINE IS. IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH IT SHOULD HAVE FOR TWO INCHES OF RAIN. AND THAT RESULTED IN AND WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE. BUT A CATASTROPHIC MUD FLOWS ARE OF SUCH PROPORTION. THAT. IT IT IT LITERALLY TOOK OUT. LARGE SWATHS OF OF THE SEA AT THE COUNT OF MANSIO. AND AND RESTRUCTURE PROPERTY LINES AND RESTRUCTURED. THAT. LAND DEMOGRAPHICS. HUGE BOULDERS AND OTHER KINDS DEPRECIABLE TWENTY FEET HIGH TREASON SECTOR TAKING OUT HOMES AS THEY COME CAME DOWN AND UNFORTUNATELY. TAKING OUT ARE A NUMBER OF LIVES. AND. IT IN THIS AGAIN RESULTED IN AGAIN ONE OF ICE I SAY IT WAS VERY COMPLEX AND AND UNPRECEDENTED IN THE NORTHERN FIRES WE ARE NOW IF WE WERE NOW FACING ANOTHER UNPRECEDENTED UP COMPLEX. SET OF. DEBRIS OPERATIONS WITH THIS MOD. THE KEY THING HERE WAS THAT DUMB. YOU KNOW WE NEEDED TO WRITTEN WE NEED IT TO WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A SECOND STORM. AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS THE CREEKS AND THE AND THE DEBRIS BASIS HAD COME BECOME. TOTALLY FALL AND SO WE CAN TURN TO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS UP BECAUSE OF THEIR CONTRACT CAPABILITY. DTS HE WAS ALREADY GONE AND OUT COVER CYCLE COMMITTED INVENTOR UP. AND WE WE TURN TO THE CORE TUBE TO BRING IN THEIR CONTRACTORS AND TO IMMEDIATELY START WORKING ON THOSE TO PRE BASES WE WHAT WE KNEW THAT IF WE HAD ANOTHER STORM WE NEED TO LEAST GET. THOSE THOSE THE BASINS CLEARING THOSE CREEKS CLEAR TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE ROLE THAT THE RIGHT OFF. AND SO WE IDENTIFIED ELEVEN A DEBRIS BASINS. AND DUCKED AND THE TO DATE TEN OF THOSE LAWS HAVE BEEN CLEARED. ARM AND WE ALSO IDENTIFIED. TEN A CREEK SYSTEMS AND FIVE OF THOSE TEN CREEKS HAVE BEEN. CLEARED THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW THERE THERE THERE THERE IS A LOT MORE DEBRIS IT'S SITTING ABOVE MONNA SETO GOD YET TO COME DOWN AND SO WHAT WE WERE WE WERE REALLY RAPIDLY. MOVING FORWARD TO GET THAT THAT DONE. AND. WORKING WITH ALL THE STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND EVEN PRIVATE SECTOR. TO MAKE THIS ALL COME TOGETHER SO YOU CAN SORT OF IMAGINE. THAT. AT ONE TIME WE HAVE WE COLLECTIVELY. MANAGING THREE YOU KNOW CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN THREE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AND. IT. ALL OF THIS ACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN DONE THE HOUSING THE DEBRIS THE DEBRIS OPERATIONS GETTING ALL THE SWEET WE SORT OF ALLIES HAVE HAVE ALL BEEN DONE IN IN A FIVE MONTH PERIOD AND DOUBT. I KNOW WE ALL WORKING GOVERNMENT. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT. THAT THAT'S HARD TO REALLY SORT OF COMPREHENSION BUT. BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT. CAN BE DONE AND. IT'S IT'S BASED UPON. A COLLABORATIVE A COORDINATED APPROACH OF GREAT GREAT RESOURCES AREN'T WILLING TO. TO FIGHT THE FIGHT. ARE SO WITHOUT I THINK I'LL STOP HERE AND. ALTERNATE OVER TO CAN AND YOU CAN FOLLOW UP WITH ANY ADDITIONAL IF. THANK YOU I THINK YOU IF I COULD JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO BOOT UP OF A POLICE STATION. AND MAYBE I COULD THANK YOU. GREAT HERE WE ARE. AND THIS WORKS. WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MORNING MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON A. KENDIRAS OF WITH A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR RECOVER CYCLE. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO DIRECTOR GIL OUR DUTY AND IS AND IS NOT A COMMENTS AND I WILL. ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS OF. THE EXTRAORDINARY COLLABORATION COOPERATION WITH. HELLO YES AND OTHER PARTNER AGENCIES I'M AS I GO THROUGH. MY PRESENTATION MY INTENT TODAY IS TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OPERATIONALLY WHAT WE DO YOU FOR A GREAT DEAL ABOUT NUMBERS AND METRICS. BUT I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OUR PROCESS AND WHAT'S INVOLVED. IN THE DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATION. AND SORT OF OUR OPERATING PRINCIPLES IN DOING THAT BUT ALSO OUR FOCUS AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO ON THROUGH OUR THROUGH A PROCESS. SO. PURSUANT TO. GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION THE STATE EMERGENCY IT ESSENTIALLY IS AS NECESSARY TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PROTECTION PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SAFETY AND AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ME REFERENCE THAT NUMEROUS TIMES. WE ARE TASKED WITH ARRANGING FOR MATERIALS AND SERVICES AND AND BASICALLY PROVIDING RESOURCES TO REMOVE DANGEROUS DEBRIS. THAT MISSION IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FROM THE IMPACTS OF ASH DEBRIS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN HEARD OF SOME OF WHAT THAT IS. WHEN A FIRE OCCURS WHEN A STRUCTURE IS BURNED. LEAD IS RELEASED MERCURY RICH IS RELEASED AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF RELEASE OF MATERIALS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE SOILS UNDERNEATH THAT PARCEL. ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUILAR CURIE. REPRESENTING LAKE YOU UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL. FOR FIRES IN TWO YEARS AND AND WE'VE STRUGGLED OFTEN. AND IN THOSE CLEANUPS BECAUSE OF ARSENIC AND LEAD AND MERCURY AND OTHER CAN HEAVY METALS THAT REST WITHIN THAT SOIL BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF MINING. AND THE HISTORY OF OFTEN BUILDING ON TOP OF OLD BURN. FROM DECADES PAST. THAT COMES UP TO THE SURFACE. WE NEED TO REACH A BACKGROUND LEVEL WE NEED TO RESTORE A SAFE PROPERTY A SAFE COMMUNITY BACK TO THOSE RESIDENTS. AND SO WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH A TASK WITH ADDRESSING THAT BUT ALSO HELPING TO FACILITATE ACCELERATE THE RECOVERY PROCESS. PROVIDING THE MEANS BY WHICH COMMUNITIES CAN BEGIN TO TO REBUILD. TO THAT POINT. I WAS THAT I WAS INVENTORY LAST WEEK ATTENDED AN ALL HANDS MEETING OF OF THREE HUNDRED CREW THREE HUNDRED LABORS. WHO ARE OUT THERE DOING IT? AND I ASKED THEM YOU KNOW WHY DO AND THE RESPONSE. ENTHUSIASTICALLY FROM THE THE CRUISE WAS WE ARE REBUILDING COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE WE DON'T OFTEN HEAR ABOUT. COMPASSION AND EMPATHY FROM GOVERNMENT BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE LEVEL OF COMPASSION AND HUMANITY THAT WE TRY AND BRING TO THIS TO HELP REBUILD THESE LIVES. SO. MY APOLOGIES TO DOCTOR PARISH FOR NOT INCLUDING. BUT THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION ON THIS LIST BUT. YOU HEARD DIRECTOR KILLERS EACH ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT NOTHING THAT'S VERY MUCH HOW THIS HAPPENS. IT'S WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IT'S WITH LOCAL PARTNERS REALLY EMPOWERING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TO BE TO BE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT ON HOW THIS WORKS WORKING WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL LIAISONS AND TRIBAL MONITORS TO MAKE SURE THAT AS PART OF OUR RECOVERY. OPERATION WE ARE NOT DISTURBING SACRED SITES AND WE ARE MANAGING THOSE SITES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SOLID WASTE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HELPING US IDENTIFY LANDFILLS WHERE MATERIAL CAN GO. AND THEN A HOST OF STATE PARTNERS CALLAWAY YES KELLY PA. NOT ENOUGH CAN BE SAID. ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL HAS DEMONSTRATED THEY HAVE SET THE PACE IN THE OF SET THE TONE FOR THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HERE. AND AND I I'M I'M GRATEFUL TO HEAR FROM OTHERS THAT THAT THAT IS BEING ACKNOWLEDGED. OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE FOR HELPING US TO FINANCE ALL OF THIS. SO. WE CONDUCT THIS UNDER THREE INTERTWINED OPERATING PRINCIPLES. THE FIRST IS SAFETY. ENSURING THE CREWS ENSURING OUR TEAMS ENSURING THE RESIDENTS AND THE COMMUNITIES. THEIR SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT DURING AND AFTER OPERATIONS AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SEVERAL OF IMAGES FROM WORK THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW INVENTORY WHICH HELPS DEMONSTRATE THIS POINT. THE SECOND OPERATING PRINCIPLE IS DOCUMENTATION. IMMEDIATELY ONCE WHERE TASK AND ONCE WE MOBILIZE. THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO IS ASSESS WE DOCUMENT THE SITES WE HAVE A CONTRACTOR WHO GOES OUT MEASURES THE SIZE OF THE PARCELS BEGINS TO LOOK AT THE TYPES OF DEBRIS THAT IS THAT IS THERE. TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY DETAILED LEVEL. AND THEY ALSO CONDUCT THE FIELD MONITORING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TONNAGES THAT ARE COMING OUT ARE WELL DOCUMENTED THIS IS FOR FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY BUT IT'S ALSO FOR OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT WHEN UP A RESIDENT RETURNS WHEN WE RETURN THAT PROPERTY TO THE COUNTY. THAT WE'VE DEMONSTRATED WHAT IT IS WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AND WE HAVE VALIDATED THAT WE HAVE DID INDEED DO THAT. LASTLY A COMMUNICATION WITH THE RESIDENTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCIES AND WITHIN THE TEAMS TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS AND PROBLEM SOLVE SO THAT EVERYBODY IS FUNCTIONING IN A SAFE. AND ENGAGED ENVIRONMENT. SO. THERE'S A PRE PLANNING THAT GOES ON ONCE WHERE TASK THERE'S AN ACTIVE AND ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH HELLO YES PART OF THAT IS DOING THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT. IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE FACING HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARCELS WHERE THEY ARE SOME OF THE GEOGRAPHY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND AGAIN IN THE IMAGES YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE. A LITTLE LATER IN THIS PRESENTATION YOU'LL GET A SENSE OF COMPLICATED GEOGRAPHY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH INVENTORY. ITS DIALOGUE IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING TO DO IN HELPING TO EMPOWER THEM TO TAKE LEADERSHIP ROLES. THEY ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE FACE OF OUR OPERATION AT THE DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS CENTER SOMEONE A RESIDENT WALKS INTO SUBMIT A RIGHT OF ENTRY FORM WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN A MOMENT. THEY SEE SOMEONE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT CITY OR COUNTY THAT WALKS THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS ON TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR WHEN THEY SIGNED UP FOR THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. WE CONDUCT COMMUNITY MEETINGS WE GO OUT AND MEET WITH SURVIVORS PEOPLE WHO. HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND WE ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO HEAR ABOUT THEIR PROPERTIES TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. AND TO STAY FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS TO TALK WITH INDIVIDUALS LOOKING AT THEIR PHOTOS YOU KNOW HERE'S MY SITUATION HERE'S MY RETAINING WALL WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME. AND WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO TALK TO US TO REACH OUT TO THE DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS CENTER SO THAT WE ARE THERE FOR THEM TO ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS. AND AND HELP THEM. AND THEN LASTLY WE'RE DEVELOPING OPERATIONAL PLAN STAFFING PLANS AND SCHEDULES CONTRACT DOCUMENTS IN PREPARING SOLICITATIONS. ARE CONTRACTING PROCESS VARIES DEPENDING ON STATE OR FEDERAL MONEY. AND THE FEDERAL PROCESS TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER BECAUSE OF OUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO FEMA GUIDELINES. FORGIVE ME IF YOU CAN'T SEE THIS BUT THIS IS. IT BASICALLY OUR HISTORY SENSE A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS YOU CAN SEE THAT. IN THE FIRST. COUPLE YEARS THAT WE DID IT THERE WAS THE ENCORE A FIRE IN THE SAN BRUNO. DISASTER. AND THEN THERE WAS A BIT OF A LULL BUT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WERE REALLY FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. TO TODAY. THE FIRES HAVE GROWN IN GREATER INTENSITY. THE PROJECTS HAVE BECOME LONGER THAT TONNAGES REMOVED MY COMPLIMENTS TO. DIRECTOR GIL ADDICTION HAVING A MORE UPDATED DATA POINT ON THE ON THE WIND FIRE. IN TOTAL YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIRTY SIX OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN DEBRIS REMOVAL SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE CLOSER TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF MATERIAL I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DEVASTATION THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES IS NOT NECESSARILY A DRIVING FACTOR IN TERMS OF COST. YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE BUTTE FIRE. FORGIVE ME THE THE. YES THE BUTTE FIRE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PARCELS BUT THAT WAS NEARLY A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST THOSE CALAVERAS COUNTY. IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT EVERY FIRE IS DIFFERENT EVERY EVENT IS DIFFERENT NONE OF THEM ARE SIMPLER BUT SOME ARE NONE OF THEM ARE SIMPLE BUT SUMMER SIMPLER THAN OTHERS THE CHALLENGE WITH CALAVERAS. WAS. WHAT YOU HEARD FROM DIRECTOR PIMLOTT? HIS THE SPREAD OF DEBRIS THESE WERE LARGE PARCELS. WITH. FUND PERMITTED STRUCTURES THAT WERE SIMPLY BUILT BY THE RESIDENTS THERE THERE WERE A LOT OF COLLECTORS SO IT WAS VERY COSTLY IN TERMS OF BE ACCESS TO THESE AS WELL AS THE SHEER VOLUME OF MATERIAL. SO THERE'S NO REAL GAUGE IT'S JUST ALL BASED ON WHAT BURNS. BUT YOU'LL SEE THAT SEVERAL WITHIN LAKE COUNTY AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE THOMAS FIRE AND THEN WE WERE PART OF THAT MUCH MUD SLIDE AND A DEBRIS BASIN REMOVAL EFFORTS. IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST RECENT ADVANCES AS I HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED. OUR PARTICIPATION IS THERE ON THE LEFT A WITH BUTTE NEVADA YOU BUT WILL SO OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE INLAND BRANCH OF THE NORTHERN FIRES. THAT WAS AN EIGHT WEEK EFFORT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STRUCTURES I BELIEVE. JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW WE TRY TO ENGAGE AND CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY THIS WAS DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER. IN. COOPERATION WITH SOME OF ARE CONTRACTING CRUZ CAL RECYCLE STAFF. ADOPTED THIRTEEN FAMILIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD SOMETHING OF A CHRISTMAS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD LOST EVERYTHING AND SO THEY TO PASS THE BOAT TO KIND OF GIVE THESE. GIVE THESE FOLKS. SOME SEMBLANCE OF A OF A HOLIDAY. WE'RE INVOLVED IN A SMALL PORTION OF LAKE COUNTY AND THEN THE MOST RECENT EFFORTS OF TRINITY BEEN TORN SANTA BARBARA WHAT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE SENATE THINK NEEDS TO BEEMPHASIZED IS THESE ARE OVERLAPPING EVENTS. WHILE WORST JUST FINISHING ONE ANOTHER AND WILL BEGIN AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF MOBILIZATION NEEDS TO GO ON THERE'S A LOT OF TIME IN DETAIL. THAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SAFELY MOBILIZING AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. JUST BRIEFLY ON THE VENTURA FAIRGROUNDS. EFFORT AT WITH DEBRIS BASINS WE'VE COMPLETED THIS EFFORT. ON OVER THE WEEKEND. TWO THOUSAND LOADS TWENTY EIGHT. THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO CUBIC YARDS OF MATERIAL OF ITS PARTS FOR IN TERMS OF SOIL ROCK WOULD WASTE AND METALS. AND WE DID THIS. WE MOBILIZED WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND THIS WAS OVER THE COURSE OF A ONE MONTH TO KIND OF CLEAR THIS AREA. OF ONCE AGAIN AND EXTRAORDINARY JOB BY. THE OF THE TEAM I AM VERY PROUD TO OVERSEE. AND HANDLING THE THIS MATTER. HERE'S A PHOTO OF THAT DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATION ARE EXCUSE ME THE OF PROCESSING AND TRANSFER. THAT WE WERE DOING ON THE VENTURA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND YOU CAN SEE. THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT'S INVOLVED THE TRUCKS THAT ARE COMING INTO THIS. THE MATERIAL IS SORTED. AND. WHILE IT IS HEAVY EQUIPMENT IT IS AN IMPRESSIVE THING TO WATCH THESE OPERATORS MANEUVER THROUGH THIS MATERIAL AND AND TEASE OUT WOOD AND ROCK AND MATURE FROM BIG PILES WITH THIS HEAVY EQUIPMENT THEY THEY REALLY ARE. EXTRAORDINAIRE PROFESSIONALS. WHO DO THIS? AND SO THIS THIS IS A TYPICAL AMERICAN TRANSFER PROCESSING THE MUD. AS MOST YOU MAY KNOW WAS. DISPERSED TOO UGLY TO BEACH. THE WOOD WAS. SENT OFF TO CHIP VERY FACILITY IN THE ROCK WAS PART OF A A RECYCLING I'M EFFORT. I REALIZE YOU CAN'T SEE THIS SINCE YOU MENTION HAS BEEN TELL US A BESIDES THE AND THE MUD GOING TO DELETE A BEACH WHERE ELSE I MEAN THAT THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF DEBRIS CORRECT WHERE ELSE DID IT GO. EGGHEAD BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF OUR CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS WE STILL HAVE A LOT. OF THIS REMAINING AND WHERE CAN WE PUT THIS AND WATER WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IS YOUR QUESTION RELATIVE TO THEM THE MUD. BECAUSE WITH MY DARTED THAT THE DEBRIS FROM THE. PRIVATE PROPERTIES THAT'S GOING TO TO LANDFILLS ALIKE TIGERS AND SOME OTHER OUTLYING LAND SO YOU'RE JUST DOING THE DEBRIS CLEARANCE FOR PUBLIC PROPERTY IS PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU'RE DOING RED EYED ANGELA CORRECT AREN'T ANY ARE YOU SENDING IT TO TO HE GOES. PART OF IT IS GOING THERE AND CRY WAS THE DECISION MADE WHERE IT GOES THAT'S PART OF THE COLLABORATION THAT GOES ON WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE WORK WITH THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. TO HELP DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE LANDFILLS THAT CAN HANDLE THAT WHAT IS THEIR CAPACITY. AND SO AGAIN IT'S PART OF THAT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT SO THAT THEY ARE THAT WE ARE REACHING OUT TO THEM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS REACHING OUT TO THEM. AND SO WE WON'T FORCE OURSELVES ON A ON A LAND FILL IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT AND SO IN SOME CASES WE DO. RENT AND ISSUES WHERE LANDFILL MAY NOT HAVE THE KIND OF CAPACITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED AND SO WE WORKED WITH ANOTHER NEIGHBORING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT AND SO SOME OF THE COSTS THAT YOU SUFFER CALAVERAS FOR EXAMPLE. WAS MOVING THAT MATERIAL AWAY FROM LANDFILLS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY AND TAKING IT. A SEVENTY MILES FURTHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MATERIAL COULD BE HANDLED WHEN YOU SAY LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO YOU'RE WITH RENTAL TYPICALLY THAT THESE ARE. LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE THOSE THAT OPERATE. ON AND OVERSEE SOLID WASTE OPERATIONS WITHIN WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THEY'RE IN EFFECT OUR AGENT I'M ON THE GROUND THE STATE DOESN'T DIRECTLY. HANDLED. IT WE WE PARTNER WITH THEM BUT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTIFICATION AND OVERSIGHT OF SOLID WASTE FACILITIES CHOI APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS BREAKING THIS UP BUT I HAVE A BURNING QUESTION THAT. HASN'T YET TO BE ANSWERED. AND THAT IS OF DEALING WITH THE MUD NAM PUT ON TO LEAD A BEACH. I I HAVEN'T YET GOTTEN A STRAIGHT ANSWER ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT. MODE WAS. HAD ANY ELEMENTS IN IT THAT WERE POLLUTING THE OCEANS POLLUTING THE BEACH I DO MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT PERMIT FOR THAT HAS HAS EXPIRED RIGHT BUT THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN YEAH AND A LOT OF CONSTERNATION AND I KNOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE KNOWN AS HAD A NUMBER OF CAUSES WELL WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT CAN YOU GIVE US THAT ANSWER. WHAT I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS FALLS WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AS WELL AS? SENATE BARBARA COUNTY IS THAT SOME TESTING HAS BEEN DONE. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH ANY CONFIDENCE THE DEFINITIVE LIST OF THAT TESTING BECAUSE THAT JUST HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DIRECTLY ENGAGED AND SO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. THE AND THE DECISION WAS MADE BY THIS THE BOARD LIPSKY'S ME THAT THE COUNTY SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND THE REGIONAL BOARD HAS BEEN ENGAGING WITH THEM ON THIS. S. I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE A DEFINITIVE RESPONSE FOR YOU ADDRESS NOT ARMS AND OUR JESSE IS THIS MAY BE SOMETHING GOING FORWARD BECAUSE EVERYBODY SAYING TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AS I UNDERSTAND IT I BELIEVE. AND THE PUBLIC ISN'T VERY HAPPY WITH THAT SORT OF TENTATIVE. EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN BRILLIANT I HAVE TO SAY BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS THAT ONE THING UNDERSTOOD ANDAND IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN SO I DON'T KNOW AS ITSELF TO GIVE US HER AS I UNDERSTAND IT. THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT AT SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. BYE BYE STANDARD PROTOCOL FOLLOWING STORMS AND OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS THAT. MOVE DEBRIS DOWN INTO THESE CATCH BASINS ARE THEY ARE ROUTINELY AFTER THESE EVENTS. WAS THEY CLEAN THESE CATCH BASINS OUT DO SORT OUT. THE MUD DEBRIS AND THEY HAVE BY PRACTICE. PUSH THAT MIGHT DEBRIS AL ON THE GULLY TO BEACH. IN THAT AREA THEY DONE IT BEFORE THAT'S THAT'S THEIR STANDARD OPERATING PRACTICE. IN THIS CASE ARE THEY HAD ALREADY MOVED TO DO THAT IN AND BEGAN THAT PROCESS. OF WHEN THEY PUT PERMITS IN PLACE AND ENGAGE WITH THE WATER. STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE CALVET PART IN OF OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ERA. AYE ELL THE DIFFERENT. AT THE TEASE THAT HAD TO BE RESPONSIBILITY FROM FOR MANAGING EITHER THE FISHERIES OR ABOUT A COASTAL AREA. AND WERE GIVEN THE THE PERMITS TO PROCEED AND AGAIN BASED UPON. I THINK PREVIOUS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE. AS AS YOU KNOW WAS I GOT DOWN THERE AND LOOKED INTO THAT'S IT YOU KNOW IT IT I DID NOT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LANDFILLS AND AVAILABLE AND NOT KNOWING EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE. SOIL AT THE TIME GIVEN THE. AMOUNT OF. DESTRUCTION THAT TOOK PLACE IN STRUCTURES AND MAYBE SOME SEPTIC TANKS AND OTHER KINDS OF UP. INFRASTRUCTURE OF LOS. WHAT WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT? THEM IN THE ANYTHING ANY MATERIAL WAS IN THE IN THE OF SOIL THERE WAS SOME TESTING THAT WAS DONE THAT SHOWED. HIGHER LEVELS OF. AS I UNDERSTAND IT ALIBI THAT SCENE THAT. ACTUAL. STUDIES THEMSELVES BUT ANECDOTALLY UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS SOME HIGHER LEVELS OF E. COLI. THAT WAS A IN THE SOIL BOB BUT AS I UNDERSTOOD OF THE PUBLIC WORKS OFFICE IT WAS WITH IN THOSE NORMAL RANGE OF OF HIGHER E. COLI THAT THEY SEE AFTER EVERY. KIND OF EVENT LIKE THIS SO. NEVER THE LESS THEY HOW BLAH THE PERMIT IT'S NOT BEEN. RENEWED AND AND AND THEY DID NOT REQUEST TO BE BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT AT THE STATE ACTED THAT. THE THE LOCAL AUTHORITY DECIDED NOT TO RENEW THAT PERHAPS WE CAN GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THIS WHEN. OF THE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES PER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OUT EVERY CREE JUST LETTING MY SEAT UP TO REMIND ME TO A MITCHELL WHO ESOS QUESTIONS WITH GREAT THANK YOU THE BRITISH DON'T A REASONABLE QUESTION SENATOR. THINK THINKING. SO THIS IS INTENTIONALLY A VERY DENSE DOCUMENT AND I REALIZE YOU CAN'T READ IT BUT THIS IS WHAT REFLECTS SORT OF THAT THE DEGREE OF DETAIL THAT GOES ON WITH WHAT WE DO. AND THIS WAS AGAIN TETHERED TO THE. THE MUD. SORTING PROJECT. SO. HERE'S OUR PROCESS. IN VARIOUS STEPS GREAT HOPES. GO BACK. AGAIN DETAILS HE COMES IN AND REMOVES HE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL I THINK WAS ALLUDED TO PROPANE TANKS. THERE'S OFTEN AMMUNITION. GAS TANKS OTHER OTHER HAZARDS THAT ARE PRESENT AND SO THEY MAKE THE FIRST EFFORT TO REMOVE THE HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND THEY ARE GENERALLY DOING A VERY THOROUGH JOB. BUT TO BE FAIR TO THEM. OFTENTIMES OTHER HAZARDS ARE BURIED UNDER ASHEN OTHER MATERIALS IN ART REVEALED UNTIL WE ACTUALLY GO IN AND BEGIN TO SORT. ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC THINGS THAT WE EVER FOUND WAS A GRENADE LAUNCHER AND ACTUAL ROCKET. UNFORTUNATELY. IT WAS INACTIVE BUT. SAFETY PROTOCOLS WE SHUT IT DOWN WEEKS ESTABLISHED A PERIMETER CONTACTED. LOCAL SHERIFF SHERIFF CONTACTED LOCAL AIRFORCE BASE THEY CAME OUT. IT WAS FINE THEY REMOVED IT BUT IT DID AT FOR A BIT OF DRAMA THAT DAY IN A LITTLE BIT OF A SLOWDOWN. SO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IS REMOVED THAT UPON RECEIPT OF A RIGHT OF ENTRY FORM WHICH IS THAT PROPERTY OWNERS PERMISSION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN. REMOVING MATERIAL FROM THEIR PROPERTY. WE DO ASIDE ASSESSMENT AS I MENTIONED WE BEGIN TO MEASURE. ENGAGE WHAT THAT PROPERTY HAS ITS ITS FOOTAGE ARM. MOORINGS. RETAINING WALLS FOUNDATIONS EVERYTHING THAT'S THEIR THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME IN AND ADDRESS. THERE'S AN ASBESTOS SURVEY AND A REMOVAL AND THEN VEHICLES ARE ARE REMOVED AND CHIMNEYS AND CHIMNEYS BECAME QUITE A QUITE A PHENOMENON FOR US IN VENTURA WAIT. NEARLY EVERY HOME AND HAD A CHIMNEY AND SO THAT ADDS A LAYER OF COMPLEXITY AND AND SAFETY RISK FOR US SO WE HAD TO PARK ARE AT IN. BONN. PROFESSIONALS WHO TAKE DOWN CHIMNEYS AND AND REMOVE THAT MATERIAL. BECAUSE THERE ARE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OFTEN ASBESTOS. WE'RE TAKING WAY METALS ASH DEBRIS AND CONCRETE WE REMOVED THE FOUNDATION THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED. ARE READ OF THE SCIENCE IN THE LITERATURE ON THIS IS THAT UNDER THESE EXTREME HEAT SITUATIONS THE INTEGRITY OF THAT CONCRETE. IS NOT SOUND IT'S GONE IT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED AND THIS AGAIN IS WHAT ADDS TO THE COST IN THE VOLUME OF WHAT OF WHAT WE'RE REMOVING. ONCE THE PARCEL IS COMPLETELY CLEARED WE DO SOIL CONFIRMATION SAMPLING. PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT WAS TO MEASURE BACKGROUND LEVELS WHAT WAS THE LEVEL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS HAS HEAVY METALS. IN THAT AREA PRIOR TO THE FIRE. AND WE MATCH THAT THROUGH OUR SOIL CONFIRMATION SAMPLING. WE COME IN SOMETIMES WE SCRAPE SEVERAL INCHES DOWN TO GET THE SOIL CLEAN WE TESTED IF IT RETURNS HOT WE CONTINUE TO SCRAPE ON AS I MENTIONED IN LAKE COUNTY WE WERE DIGGING AS DEEP AS TENDENTIOUS SOMETIMES. TO ULTIMATELY RESTORE TO THOSE BACKGROUND LEVELS BUT THAT IS OUR COMMITMENT TO RETURN THAT PROPERTY. I'M SAFELY. A FINAL INSPECTION IS CONDUCTED AND THEN THAT PROPERTY ONCE ALL THE OF EROSION CONTROL AND EVERYTHING IS PUT INTO PLACE. IT IS RETURNED TO THE COUNTY. AND THEN RETURNED TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT INVENTORY YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF THESE NUMBERS WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX SITES REGISTERED. AT THIS POINT WE ASSESSED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN. YOU'LL NOTE THAT DUMB THE OTHER A FEW SITES THAT WERE NOT ELIGIBLE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN. A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR THEY MAY HAVE BEEN ONLY A PARTIAL BURN AND SO WE WE. TRY AND STICK WITH JUST A TOTAL DESTRUCTION. SITES WITH THE. WITH BALK AS BEST AS I THE NUMBER PARCELS THAT WE'VE COMPLETED AND THEN TO PROVE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AND SO WORRIED ABOUT A TWENTY THREE PERCENT COMPLETION RATE THIS BEGAN IN. THE MIDDLE OF JANUARY AND AS YOU HEARD WERE HOPING. IT IF ALL GOES WELL TO BE DONE BY THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL. EARLY APRIL. NEWTON. SO HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AS I MENTIONED SUMMER SIMPLER THAN OTHERS. THIS IN MANY WAYS IS IS A BIT OF A SIMPLER PART OF PARCEL. THERE'S A FEW HAZARD TREES AND THINGS THAT ARE AROUND THAT. BUT THAT SHOULD BE A RATHER STRAIGHTFORWARD. MAYBE A COUPLE OF DAYS. TO TAKE THAT PARCEL NAM AND AND RESTORE IT. BUT THEN YOU START TO RUN INTO SOME MORE COMPLEXITY. THIS IS AT THE BOTTOM OF HILLSIDE WERE STANDING ATOP A DESTROYED PROPERTY AND THEN DOWN THE HILLSIDE YOU SEE ANOTHER DESTROYED PROPERTY. I TALKED ABOUT SAFETY IT'S NOT JUST SAFETY FOR THE PERSON RETURNING YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE. INTACT HOMES. NEXT TO THE COMPLETELY DESTROYED HOMES AND IN SOME CASES AND I MET SOME OF THESE NEIGHBORS ARM JUST LAST WEEK. THEY'RE LIVING IN THESE HOMES WHILE THERE IS DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS GOING ON ACROSS THE STREET. AND SO WE HAVE TO ENGAGE A HIGH DEGREE OF SAFETY. AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION DUST CONTROL AIR MONITORING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CAUSING ANY HARM TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL THERE. THIS ISN'T VERY DRAMATIC. SITE. THE DRIVE NOW WOULD DRIVE WAY TO KNOW WHERE. THERE WAS A HOME AT THE END OF THIS DRIVEWAY. IT WAS BUILT ON TO THE HILLSIDE. THE FIRE CAME THROUGH DESTROYED ALL THE MOORINGS AND ALL THE PEERS THAT WERE HOLDING THAT UP. IF YOU STAND ATOP THAT DRIVEWAY IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTEEN FOOT DROP. AND THEN A FORTY FOOT LEDGE. OF A DESTROYED HOME. AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER LEDGE THAT ROLLS DOWN. INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THERE ARE SOME INTACT HOMES AND OUT AND AND NOT OTHERS. THIS IS THE DRAMATIC. EFFECT OF OF WHAT WE SEE THIS IS THE HORRIFYING NATURE. OF WHAT WENT ON. THESE ARE THESE ARE LIVES THESE ARE HOMES THESE ARE MEMORIES THAT ARE NOW GONE AND AND IT'S HARDFOR USTO. ON NOT DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM FROM THAT. THIS IS ANOTHER SITE THERE IT ACTUALLY HAD SOME STEEL FRAME CONSTRUCTION. AND A CHIMNEY THIS ONE WE HAVE NOT. EVEN BEGUN WE HAVE EVEN ASSESS THE SITE BECAUSE OF THE. LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY OF THE LEDGE THAT IT'S ON BECAUSE OF THE PRESENT HAZARDS THAT ARE THERE FOR ANY CREW GETTINGON THEIR. THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY COMPLICATED SITE FOR US. YOU SAW THE DRIVEWAY THAT DROPPED OFF. THIS IS A VIEW FROM JUST DOWN THE STREET. LOOKING TO THAT DRIVE WAY AND THIS IS THIS THE STATE OF OF WHAT. OUR CREWS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY HEAVY EQUIPMENT IN THERE. AND WHAT ARE CREWS ON THE GROUND ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW pAND SOME OF THAT MAY HAVE TO BE HAND REMOVAL. ON THAT'S A TIMELY TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY EFFORT. BUT IT HAS TO BE CLEANED YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENT HAZARDS OF DAMAGE TREES YOU CAN SEE THE LANDSCAPE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE IN THE FOREGROUND TO THE RIGHT THERE. THERE'S A NEIGHBORHOOD. THERE'S THEIR HOMES THAT ARE INTACT. THIS IS SOMEWHAT SIMPLER. IT'S FLAT BUT. THEY'RE HAZARDS THERE IN TERMS OF THE TREES IN TERMS OF THE. SMOKES AT THE CHIMNEYS. THAT MAY BE A LITTLE SIMPLER FOR US BUT AGAIN DOES THAT IS THE BUT THE WIDE VARIETY AND RANGE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THIS IS THAT SIMPLY AN AIR MONITOR THESE ARE PLACE THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOODS TO MAKE SURE THAT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ARE FLOATING AROUND IN THE AIR AND THAT THEY'RE BEING THAT THEY'RE BEING MEASURED. AND THAT SIGNAGE THERE PUT BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WARNING PEOPLE OF THE SITE. THIS IS A TYPICAL OPERATION. YOU SEE THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT. YOU SEE THE CREW MEMBER MEMBER. IN THE WHITE TIE VICKI HAS A RESPIRATOR HARD HAT HE IS FULLY PROTECTED. THE CREW MEMBER AT THE FRONT THAT'S THE MONITOR. IS KIND OF WATCHING THE THE PROGRESS DOCUMENTING IT. THERE IS A WATER TRUCK ADJUST TO THE LEFT OF THE BACK OF THEIR TO KEEP DUST CONTROL. AND THEN THAT THE BLUE TENTED AREA THERE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED THE DECONTAMINATION ARE IN NO ONE LEAVES THAT SITE. WITHOUT TAKING OFF ALL OF THEIR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT A WITHIN THAT AND LEAVING THAT BEHIND THERE'S ALSO WHAT'S CALLED EXCLUSION ZONE A RED ZONE WHERE NO ONE WHO. IS ALLOWED INTO THAT UNLESS THEY'RE WEARING THE APPROPRIATE THAT THE APPROPRIATE EQUIPMENT. AND THIS IS WHAT REMAINS WHEN WE'RE DONE. THIS IS A CLEAR PARCEL. IN FACT THEIR. I DON'T SEE ANY. TEST FLAG SO THAT THIS SOIL HAS BEEN CLEARED THIS SITE IS READY UPON TO BE RETURNED TO THE RESIDENT. AND READY TO REBUILD YOU CAN SEE THAT WE DO LEAVE CERTAIN THINGS BEHIND ON WALLS AND AND OTHER OTHER ASPECTS OF IT BECAUSE THAT THOSE CAUSE GREATER HARM TO THE NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND AND INCREASED COSTS UNNECESSARILY. IF WE REMOVE DOZENS OR VERY JUDICIOUS IN HOW WE TAKE THINGS OUT. SO THAT'S MY PRESENTATION. I INCLUDED THIS PICTURE OF A BOGAN VIA BECAUSE WHILE WE WERE THERE WE WERE SEEING LIFE ACTUALLY RETURNING. AND SO I WANTED TO END THIS ON A VERY HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC NOTE. AND TURNED TO DOCTOR PACKAGE. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION DUCK PERCHED. IT'S GUERRA OF RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE. BRIEF YES I'M ALRIGHT AND YOU DON'T. BOB. WELL WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FINISH THIS BY NOON AND HAVE US A THREE MORE SPEAKERS AFTER THIS. TO GIVE EVERYBODY A SENSE OF WHAT OUR TIME FRAME HAS THE MORNING F. PERMANENTLY. PLUG JOHN PARISH STATE GEOLOGIST AYE I WILL. HIS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE HERE IN THE UNDERSTAND THAT WERE WONDERED AT THAT TIME RESTRAINTS. PARDON MY BACK IF I TURN AROUND EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE. WELL IN THIS. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT? ON WON'T GIVE YOU. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT TO THE DEBRIS FLOWS OF MONEY FLOWS ARE AND HOW THEY START AND WHY THEY GET VICIOUS. SOMETIMES. THESE ARE OF COURSE ISN'T THAT THAT THERE ARE CALIFORNIA'S OTHER GREAT. HAZARDS WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE TALK ABOUT EARTHQUAKES. EVERYWHERE AND US TSUNAMIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL. WE DO HAVE SOME OTHER. GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS IN STATE AND TO WE'VE HAD THEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT I WON'T BORE YOU WITH TO TWELVE MILLION YEARS OF HISTORY OF THESE. PARTICULAR ONE SINCE WERE UNDER TIME CONSTRAINTS. OF THEIR OWN. THERE SHOULD BE OPEN. SO WITH THAT. PAPA. GOING TO WRITE. RIGHT. PAGE. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF DEBRIS FLOWS THAT OF THAT WE ENCOUNTER IN THE STATE IN THEIR THEIR OLD REPOSE BUT THERE'S. THE ROCK FALL POST FIRE DEBRIS FLOWS THERE'S THAT ALLUVIAL FANS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE ALL BUILT OUT LONGER. MOUNTAIN FRONTS. AND THEN THERE'S THE FLOOD PLAINS THAT WE SEE THESE FLOWS A DUMPING INTO. THESE ARE ALL NATURALLY OCCURRING ó WITH IN THE STATE AND THEY ALL OCCUR TO THE VARIOUS DEGREES DEPENDING ON IF THERE'S A FIRE. THAT HAS AFFECTED THOSE AREAS. A FIRE IN THE AREA MAGNIFIES THE INTENSITY OF THOSE DEBRIS FLOWS IN MUD FLOWS. OF THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES. OTHERWISE THESE TEND TO OCCUR NATURALLY. WHEN WE GET A HEAVY RAINSTORM IN OF SOME OF THESE AREAS. VIDEO POPULATION VULNERABILITIES IS BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING IN TO. SOME OF THESE AFFECTED AREAS OTHER WE'RE NOT HAZARDS UNTIL WE BUILT OUR OUR COMMUNITIES UP INTO THE AREAS. AND OF THE SEQUENCE OF FIRE AND RAIN. HAS ENHANCED THE OF THE CRITICALITY AND THE INTENSITY OF THESE. DAMAGES WHEN THEY OCCUR BUT THIS IS NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR MONTROSE. YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE CANYON MOUTH. A LOT OF DEBRIS HAS COME IN THESE AREAS. WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF WILDFIRES AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TODAY AND THEY ARE OCCURRING IN AND AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES. WHAT THESE FIRES DO IS? FATE WHEN THEY BURN ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IS THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE THE SOILS. O. WE BURN OFF THE BRUSH WE BURNED THE THE TREES BECAUSE THE BRUSH IS VERY INTENSE AND. THESE TWO INTENSE FIRES WE TALKED TO GET OILS IN THE IN THE SOIL AS WELL AS THE ROOTS. CHANGE AND GIVE SOME OILS AND THE SOILS THEMSELVES TEND TO. UNDERGO CHEMICAL CHANGES AND WE GET OZONEIN THERE CALLED A HYDROPHOBIC STONE. THAT'S OWN IS IMPERMEABLE TO WATER. AND WHEN WE GET THESE INTENSE RAINS AFTERWARD THE WATER IS NO LONGER ABSORB INTO THE GROUND. AND THERE'S NOTHING TO BREAK UP IT'S RUNOFF ON THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND SO WE GET THESE GREAT TO. TORRENTS OF WATER OF FROM VERY INTENSIVE RAINFALLS AS THAT WATER. RUNS OFF THE GROUND IT STARTS PICKING UP EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. ABOUT THREE INCHES OF WATER MOVING AT THIRTY MILES AN HOUR WILL WILL PICK UP A SEMI TRAILER. AND MOVE IT. SO WHEN WE HAVE A LARGE BURN AREA LIKE WE'VE HAD HERE IN THE ABOVE MONTH ACETO WE SEE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WATER RUNNING DOWN THE CANYONS AND IT'S PICKING UP EVERY PIECE OF DEBRIS. CAN AND IN COLLECTING YET UNTIL JUST THE MOUTH OF THE CANYON AND THEN IT'S IT SPREADS. OUT OVER THE. THE LANDING ZONE. BULLETS LOOK GOOD CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DOES IS WE ARE TASKED BY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND AND CAL FIRE. TO GO OUT. OFTEN WHEN THE GROUND IS STILL HOT AND MAP THE EXTENT OF THE FIRE. AS WELL AS SAMPLE THE GROUNDS OF THE HERE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF. HA HYDROPHOBIC SOILS MIGHT BE THERE TO WHAT DEGREES OF THESE EXIST. AND TO. MAP WHAT WE CALL. OF VALUE AT RISK AREAS. ALL OF THESE DATA ARE WE DOING THIS ON A VERY SHORT TIME. WE WORK ABOUT FOURTEEN HOUR DAYS AND WE HAD TO EVERYONE FROM FIVE OF OUR OFFICES IN THE FIELDS TO DO THIS. THAT DATA IS SENT BY FIELD COMPUTER IT STREAM TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE. WE HAVE GIS CREWS WHO PUT ALL THAT DATA TOGETHER AND STREAM IT BACK TO THE FIELD SO THAT EVERYONE HAS ALL THE DATA THAT THERE. OF SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. AND HAS ALL THAT IN FRONT OF THEM FOR THE DECISION MAKERS TO USE. OF WE ALSO WORK WITH THE USGS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO MODEL AND EXPLAIN WHERE ALL OF THIS IS. THE DANGER IS GOING TO BE THE IDEA OF DOING THIS IS TO TRIAGE THE DAMAGE. SO THAT ASSUMING THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE RAINFALL IN TWELVE HOURS IS WAS OCCURRING HERE. THE ENGINEERS WILL HAVE TIME TO COME IN AND BUILD DEFENSES AGAINST. DEBRIS FLOWS THAT MAY BE COMING LATER SEVERAL WEEKS WE HOPE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. TO DEFLECT OF THE DEBRIS FLOWS AWAY FROM THE ESTABLISHMENTS AND THAT'S THE TRIAGE THAT IS DONE. IN THE CASE WE SEE IN MONTICELLO WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE HOURS WORTH OF TRIAGE TO DO IT JUST WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR ANYBODY TO GET. ANYTHING DONE THERE. THEN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A HOUSE THAT. IS CONVENIENTLY BILLED BELOW A CANYON OR THAT SO OF BEEN BURNED A BIT AND THAT IS A HIGH RISK. OF HOME RIGHT THERE THAT IS GOING TO GO WITH THE DEBRIS FLOW. AND DOWNED ON THE LOWER PICTURE YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE THE. THE VARS THE VA ARE REAL THROUGH THE. YEAH. THAT'S REAL FOURTH REAL FIVE. M. OF THOSE HOUSES WERE BUILT. IN THE BASE OF OPINION THAT CANYON HAS NOW BURNED AND WE'RE MAPPING THAT AREA TO SAY THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH RISK AREA. IF THERE IS ANY RAIN THAT'S DROPPED ON IT BECAUSE THERE'S LOOSE LAND FILL UP WITH TOP. AN INDIAN INDEED. IF THERE IS. THAT IT RAIN HERE THOSE HOUSES WILL GO IN THIS PROBABLY NO ENGINEERING WAY TO SAVE THEM RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT LONGER DRY SPELL WHERE YOU CAN PLANT SOMETHING ON THE SIDES OF THE HILLS TO TRY TO. OF HELP THESE AREAS. THERE'S JUST SOME PICTURES THAT WE SEE DEBRIS FLOWS THESE. THIS ARE THE ONES AND THEN BONTA SETO ND YOU CAN SEE. THE SIZE OF THE ROCKS IN THE CARS IN THE TREES THOSE ROCKS WAY FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS CAR WEIGHS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS. AND A LOT OF THESE WERE FOUND TWENTY FEET UP IN TREES. WHEN THESE DEBRIS FLOWS CAME OUT OF THE CANYONS WHERE THEY WERE CONFINED. THEY WERE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE FEET HIGH. S. BEFORE THEY SPREAD AND SO THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF. ABOUT TWELVE MILES AN HOUR OF A THIRTY FOOT WALL OF DEBRIS HITTING. THE DEBRIS IS WHAT DOES THE DAMAGE MORE SO THAN THE WATER BECAUSE THE DEBRIS. TEARS DOWN BUILDINGS WHEN IT CRASHES INTO THEM. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT DOES SWEEPS THE STREETS CLEAN OF EVERYTHING. HERE ARE MUDFLOWS NOW VIS THIS HYDROPHOBIC ZONE IN THE SOIL. IS NOT REMOVED AFTER THE FIRST HEAVY DEBRIS FLOW IN FACT THESE HYDROPHOBIC ZONES CAN LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS AFTER YOU CLEAN OUT THE ROUGH DEBRIS YOU MAY START CLEANING OUT MUD FLOWS LATER ON. BECAUSE THE DEBRIS IS GONE BUT YOU'RE STILL A ROADIE OF THE SURFACE AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE TREMENDOUS MUDFLOWS. COME DOWN AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE BOTTOM HERE THAT NEAR BAKERSFIELD. THERE'S A A SEMI TRAILER THE AND THE HIGHWAY WAS JUST BURIED. SO THIS HAPPENED VERY FAST AND. WITH WITHOUT WARNING AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE NEAR A A. A BURN ZONE YOU CAN BE MILES AWAY AND STILL HAVE THESE TAKING EFFECT. AND THEN OF COURSE THOUGH IT ONE OF THESE OTHERS IS ROCK FALLS OF INTENSE WATER GETS IN THE JOINTS OF ROCKS THAT UNDERCUTS THE CLIFFS AND YOU HAVE THESE GIANT ROCK FALLS THAT OCCUR. IF THE ROCK FALL OCCURS IN THE EVENING. OWE YOU HAVE THESE BOULDERS GOING TO A THREE THOUSAND POUNDS OUT ON THE STREETS AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR NIGHT DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY CITY CRASH INTO THESE. OTHERS THIS THE POOR PERSON IN THE CAR IN THE PHOTO BELOW IS ACTUALLY SWEPT OFF THE ROAD BY ROCK FALL IN AND KILLED IN THAT THE OF CURRENT. SO THESE ARE VERY. DESTRUCTIVE. EVENTS THAT OCCUR. AND LASTLY LLUVIAL FANS NOW THERE'S A VERY LARGE ALLUVIAL FAN DOWN INYO COUNTY. THIS WAS A DEGREE FLOW THAT STARTED FIVE AND A HALF MILES AWAY AT THE CANYON. WHAT IT DID TO SPREAD OUT OVER THAT ALLUVIAL FAN AND DOWN LORD RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE MOUNT WHITNEY OF FISH HATCHERY THAT WAS DESTROYED BY THIS FIVE MILES AWAY? THIS IS THE KIND OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE NOTE OF BECAUSE. IF WE'RE GOING TO PLAN OUR COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO PLAN THEM TO MITIGATE FOR THESE TYPES OF DISASTERS THAT OCCUR. THERE'S A LOT OF. DEVELOPMENT GOING ON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BUILD ON THESE ALLUVIAL FANS AND BECAUSE THEY SAY IT'S DESERT AND IT'S DRY. WILL IT MAY BE BUT IT RAINS IN THE HILLS AND YOU GET THESE ALLUVIAL. WASHES THAT COME OUT BUILDING THE FANS. SO IF THERE'S A NOTE THAT THAT. CGS HAS TO TAKE AWAY FROM FEES IT'S TO INFORM LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO REBUILD WISELY AND SAFELY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE THE. USING THE BEST ENGINEERING METHODS TO MITIGATE SOME OF TREMENDOUS OF. DEBRIS FLOWS THAT OCCUR SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEM OCCURRING AGAIN TAKING LIVES AND COSTING. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN AND. IN PROPERTY AS WELL AS BUSINESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE WERE A WELL. WELL BEHIND SCHEDULE BUT. WILL TRY TAKE COMPLIMENTS FOR FOR QUESTIONS AND IF YOU COULD TO KEEP YOUR QUESTIONS AND TO THE ANSWERS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE PRECIADO. TWO QUESTION OF COURSE I'VE GOT A HUNDRED BUT JUST TO THE LAST ONE. UP ONE IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN JAPAN THEY HAVE. DRAMATIC A WEATHER EVENTS AND HAVE CREATED SOME KIND OF A CONTAINMENT. SYSTEM. FOR WHERE AFTER FIRE THAN THEY HAVE A MUD FLOW THAT OCCURS THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY FORCES THAT THE DEBRIS IF YOU WILL TO GO DOWN LOW ENOUGH THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE. THE ABILITY TO COME BACK UP. AND TO DESTROY AREAS OF OF THAT YOU KNOW. COMMUNITIES AND SO FORTH. DO WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HERE IS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD DO AS WE TRY TO REBUILD SOME OF THESE AREAS. AS WE DEAL WITH THE DENUDED HILLSIDE TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A DENUDED HILLSIDES. IN ABOUT MANSIO IN ALL HIGH AND ON ON THE FREEWAY THE ONE A ONE FREEWAY. WHERE JUST SOME RAIN COULD BRING THEM ALL DOWN TO WE HAVE ANY SORT OF CONTAINMENT MECHANISMS THAT ARE LIKE CULVERTS BUT? THAT ARE MORE DRAMATIC SIMILAR TO WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY USE IN JAPAN IF I'M NOT CERTAIN AS DRAMATIC AS JAPAN'S BUT WE DO HAVE COLBERT'S A OF WE DO HAVE A CONTAINMENT DOME. BASINS THAT. MANY COMMUNITIES BUILD I DON'T THINK THE CONTAINMENT SO THAT THEY HAD HERE WOULD'VE STOPPED VIS ENTIRELY BUT THEIR WORK CONTAINMENT. AREAS THERE THAT DID FILL RIGHT AWAY. BUT THE FLOOD WAS JUST TOO MUCH TO FOR THESE. THE OTHER IS. WE DO A LOT OF OF WATERSHED OF WORK AND WE NEVER RECOMMEND CULVERTS. BECAUSE COLBERT'S TEND TO JAM WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND BRIDGES. ACROSS OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE COURSE IN LAYING A CULVERT BUT WE HAVE PHOTOS WHERE THE DEBRIS HAS SIMPLY JAMMED INTO THE CULVERT. AND THEN THE FOLLOWING TO BREED JUST GOES OVER THE ROADS. HOWEVER IF YOU BUILD BRIDGES ACROSS. FIFTH THE PRETENSE THAT FLOWS STRAIGHT ON THROUGH WHEN YOU DON'T BACK UP ON ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD SHOWS FOR ANY REASON WHY WE DON'T CONSIDER THE JAPANESE ENGINEERING APPROACH WHERE. YOU DO HAVE TO ASK. CALTRANS AND. AND THOSE FOLKS ON WELL ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THEM TO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO REFER TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT YES SO THEY% DON'T USE CULVERTS AS MUCH THEY DO TEND TO USE BRIDGES AND DIVERSIONBASINS DIVERSION BASINS I THINK IT'S THE PROPER NAME. RIGHT AND MY LAST QUESTION IS GIVEN. THE OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE AFTER THE MONTECITO FIRE. ARM THAT AND THE MAPPING AND SO FORTH. THE IT IT WAS A REAL CONCERN BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE AREAS RIGHT BELOW THE FIRE. WERE CLEARLY SUBJECT TO TO FLOODING INTO DEBRIS. BUT OUT SO MUCH OF THE DAMAGE OCCURRED. FARTHER DOWN AND WHAT WAS NOT A MANDATORY EVACUATION AREA CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE THINKING WAS SERVED THERE GET WHAT THE CONSIDERATIONS WERE I MEAN NO ONE KNOWS WHAT MOTHER NATURE IS GOING TO DO NECESSARILY BUT. WHAT WAS THERE SOME CONSIDERATION FOR THE FACT THAT THEY AS YOU MENTIONED THAT? YOU CAN TO IT YOU KNOW FIVE AND A HALF MILES HA OF MUD FLOW I MEAN THAT'S A LONG DISTANCE IN MONTECITO. DOESN'T QUITE GO FIVE AND BUT. WHAT WHAT WAS OR WASN'T CONSIDERED THAT PERHAPS WE CAN LEARN FROM GOING FORWARD WELL I I DON'T REALLY KNOW I KNOW WOULD WE MAPPED WHERE THOSE OF VALUE AT RISK AREAS? AND EXISTING ALREADY WERE FEMA FLOOD ZONES THAT WERE IN THOSE AREAS. BUT WE TURN ALL THAT INFORMATION OVER TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BECAUSE FOR ONE THING WE'RE NOT EQUIPPED TO MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS WE DON'T KNOW THE. COMMUNITY STRUCTURES AND THE AREAS AND THOSE PEOPLE DO THEY THEY KNOW THEIR COMMUNITIES THEY KNOW THE STRUCTURES THINK THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITIES TO DO THOSE THINGS. WE TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE BEST INFORMATION WE CAN A WHAT WE THINK THE HAZARD IS GOING TO P.. AND TO LET THEM WORK OUT HOW THAT THE BEST BELIEVE THEY CAN THEY CAN HANDLE THAT SO IN THIS WAS AN ENORMOUS ENORMOUS. OF STORM I DON'T THINK ANYONE REALLY ANTICIPATED IT WOULD BE THIS HUGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OFFER YOUR PRESENTATIONS VERY. INFORMATIVE AND AND AND THE LIMON A ELIMINATING. AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DIALOGUE. AS THE MONTHS GO BY. AND WILL NOW CALL UP OUR FINAL PANEL JEFFREY CHAMBERS DR JEFFREY CHAMBERS THE AD ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. TOMALIN SKI METEOROLOGIST WITH THE U. S. POOR SERVICE. AND TO OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE PEDRO NAVA NOW CHAIR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION WELCOME TO. ALL OF YOU. WE HAVE FORMALLY ABOUT A HALF HOUR LEFT ON OUR SCHEDULE. I'LL STICK AROUND AS. I AWELL PAST TWELVE TO A HILLSIDE BITE MY MY COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS WHO ARE ABLE TO STAY. TO BUT TO DO THE SAME IF THAT'S POSSIBLE I DON'T WANT TO CURTAIL YOUR PRESENTATIONS ANY MORE THAN. NECESSARY. BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO TELL US ARE. IMPORTANT AND GOING TO FORM THE BASIS FOR HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. WE DIDN'T FLIP A COIN SO. WHOEVER AYE HOOVER WHOEVER'S READY TO ROLL IT LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD CHERNOV. SURE. OKAY. BUT THAT WAS THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THE PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. FOUND TIME THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOOVER. A COMMISSION AND A BLAST OF BY THE QUALITY OF STAFF. BUT THAT WORK DILIGENTLY LA ON THIS REPORT OF ANY AS A CHAIRMAN I GET TO. DELIVER THE INFORMATION. BUT I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK REALLY IS PROUD TO STAFF AND FOR I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR WHAT THEY DID. THEY ALSO PUT TOGETHER. ELIOT CHART WITH. THE MEMBERS OF OF. RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. WITH THE ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN BURNED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. AND WHEN I DO THE ARITHMETIC TODAY TURNS OUT THAT ALL OF YOU SHARE OR HAVE SUFFERED. ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES THAT HAVE BEEN BURNED SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND AND I THINK THAT GIVES US SOME SENSE TO THE SCOPE OF OF OF THE PROBLEM. THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE. IS THAT AS. AS WE TALK ABOUT COLLABORATION A AND WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS AGENCIES IN THE COMMUNITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SHOULD NEVER BE FAR. FROM OUR MINDS WHEN WE DISCUSSED WHAT TO DO MOVING FORWARD AYE PASSED TO IN MY EXPERIENCE INCLUDE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND SOME WAYS IS GOING. TO END UP PLAYING A LARGE ROLE IN. INFLUENCING WHATEVER RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALL. DEVELOP. BOB BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE PREPARED UNDERWRITE CERTAIN KINDS OF RISK WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THAT IF WHETHER NOT THAT AVENUE IS GOING TO BE PURSUED AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE. SENATOR JACKSON. MADE REFERENCE TO HER BILL WITH RESPECT TO PRESCRIBED FIRE. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THAT THAT IS THE ABILITY OF A PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER TO OBTAIN A INSURANCE IF THEY CHOOSE. TO ENGAGE IN THE PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTICE AND I THAT IT CONVERSATION WITH REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE TOLD ME. THAT THERE IS IN FACT A WAY TO OBTAIN INSURANCE FOR A PROPERTY OWNER OF WHO WANTS TO. PARTICIPATE IN A PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAMS. THE OTHER PART THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS AS WETALK ABOUT. OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH. PRESCRIBED BURNS ES DE ASCHAM PARA TWO WILDFIRES. GENERALLY THEY COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AN ACRE. A TO MANAGE SO TO SPEAK A PRESCRIBED BURN AWARE AS. THE OF THE ACCEPTED NUMBERS ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS AN ACRE FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION ON A WILDFIRE. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE. THE COST TO THE COMMUNITY UP FOR EITHER LOSS OF LIFE BUT LOTS OF STRUCTURE REBUILDING OR INSURANCE PAYMENTS THAT ARE MADE. OF THE TO THE. HOLDERS OF THE INSURANCE SO THE NUMBERS ARE. DRAMATIC AND EXTREME AND I THINK. WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE. HAVING. BEEN ON THAT SIDE OF THE DIETS WHERE YOU ARE NOW I KNOW THAT A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS. WHERE'S THE MONEY COME FROM ARE AND SO PART OF THE ANSWER IS PICKING OUT ANY LATER. YOU CAN EITHER FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE RESOURCES AND GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO ENGAGE IN PRESCRIBED FIRE AND THINNING UP OR YOU CAN SUCK IT OUT OF THE BUDGET WHEN YOU HAVE TO AFTER YOU'VE HAD A WILDFIRE. THE OTHER PART THAT IS GOING TO PLAY. AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE AIR QUALITY ANY AIRPORTS. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A WILDFIRE ALL OF WHICH IS EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST YOU AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A PRESCRIBED BURN THEN YOU ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PARTICULAR MATTER. THAT COMES OUT OF THAT FIRES THERE TO BE ACCOMMODATION A WITH THE AIR BOARD TO APPLY SCIENCE AND SENSORS THE AND TO REACH AN UNDERSTANDING. THAT YOU YOU WANT TO GET THE BENEFITS OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. OF FOR BOTH THE HEALTH OF THE WATER ON THEM THE HEALTH CLUB OF THE PUBLIC. WE HEARD A DESCRIPTION FROM. CHIEF PIMLOTT. ABOUT. BUT THE HEALTHY FOREST. HISTORICALLY FIFTY TO EIGHTY TREES PER ACRE. BOB DID IS THE NUMBER FOR A HEALTHY FOREST WHAT WE HAVE NOW. BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES ON FIRE SUPPRESSION ARE AREAS THAT HAVE THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED TREES PER ACRE. IT IS THAT DIFFERENT. AND THE KIND OF TREES THAT YOU HAVE IN THOSE THREE AND FOUR HUNDRED ARE ARE DESCRIBED OFTEN A SHADE TOLERANT TREES. I HEALTHY FOREST OF FIFTY TO EIGHTY HAS LARGER TREES. FICKER BARK. ACTUALLY FIRE RESISTANT. BUT WITH A THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED YOU HAVE SHADE OF. THESE TREES THAT GROW WELL IN SHADE BUT THAT ACTUALLY ADD FUEL THE DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF MARKET IS FIRE RESISTANT THAT CREATE A LATTER ESSENTIALLY. SO THE FIRE GROWS FROM THE GROUND UP TO THE TREE TOPS THAT YOU THEN HAVE CANOPY BURNS THAT HOP AND SKIP UP ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. SO. THAT'S WHY PRESCRIBED BURN AND THINNING BOB ARE TWO OF THE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN OUR REPORT. OUR REPORT IS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAGES LONG. WE WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO THE EXPERTS WHO OFFERED THEIR TESTIMONY AND PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION STAFF FREAK OF A COORDINATED THOSE MEETINGS AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. AND SAID THAT LED TO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. PART OF WHAT YOU WANT TO A DO WITH THE. WILDFIRE ISSUES IS THAT WILDFIRES RELEASE PM TWO POINT FIVE TALKING OF AIR QUALITY A INTO THE AIR TWO POINT FIVE IS TOO SMALL. IT GETS INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM THERE'S NO WAY TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IT. AND IT REALLY WORKS AT CROSS PURPOSES FROM WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS IDENTIFIED. AS THAT ONE OF THE GOALS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS SO FOR EXAMPLE. BOB THEN TWENTY FIFTEEN. CALIFORNIA THROUGH ALL OF ITS EFFORTS AND IT TOOK SOME SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY. REDUCE ITS EMISSIONS FROM ROUTINE OMITTING ACTIVITIES BY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS. AND WERE ALL VERY EXCITED HAPPY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. BUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE RUFF FIRE IN THE SIERRA NATIONAL FOREST IN FRESNO. RELEASED SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS. SO ON THE ONE HAND WE ARE CHANGING OUR ACTIVITY AS A CULTURE AND SOCIETY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING APPROPRIATELY IN FORCE MANAGEMENT. WE COMPLETELY UNDO THE BENEFITS THAT COME ABOUT FROM REDUCTION OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES. WE'VE GOT. FANS PART OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ALSO REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT FIVE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET. GOES TO FORCE MANAGEMENT. ONLY FIVE PERCENT. THAT IS A CONSEQUENCE. OF A DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE HISTORICALLY GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS. WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDED THAT THEIR FIRE SUPPRESSION POLICIES WOULD BE IF YOU HAD A FIERY PUT IT OUT. THAT NO FIRE SHOULD GROW GREATER THAN TEN ACRES A FEW YEARS LATER THEY THEN DECIDED THAT EVERY FIRE THAT STARTED IN THE WILDERNESS SHOULD BE PUT OUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING. THAT THEN MEANT THAT THERE WERE NO FIRES THAT ROUTINELY SERVE THE PURPOSE OF ESSENTIALLY CLEARING OUT THE UNDERGROWTH. THAT THOUGHT THEM LED TO THE SORT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT WERE CONFRONTING NOW. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATIONS AND I SAY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN EMBRACED BY MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAS TO DO WITH EDUCATION. I'M. WE HAD A COMMISSIONER WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THIS STUDY. WHO GENUINELY SAID WHY DO I CARE ABOUT THE FOREST I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES? I LIVE IN THE BAY AREA I LIVE WHERE EVER I LIVE IN AN URBAN AREAS WHY DO I CARE. AND IT REALLY PROMPTED US TO BEGIN AN ANALYSIS OF THIS SITUATION SO THAT WE. COULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU SHOULD CARE THAT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA IS FOREST THAT ALMOST SIXTY PERCENT IS OWNED BY THE FEDS. THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR HEADWATERS ARE LOCATED IN THE SIERRAS. AND THAT BECAUSE OF THESE FIRES AIR QUALITY BUT IS IMPACTED AND THE AVAILABILITY OF WATER IN A DROUGHT. COULD BE INCREASED BY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE WITH A HEALTHY FOREST SO WE SUGGEST LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THAT PART OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS AN EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC. ALONG THE SAME SCOPE AS THE SAVE OUR WATER CAMPAIGN MOST PEOPLE NEVER CARED ABOUT WHAT HE OPEN THE TAP TO GET AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. SUDDENLY HAD A DROUGHT REMEMBER WHAT WE DO NEVER WASTE A GOOD CRISIS SO BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT. WE GET PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR WE BELIEVE THAT ARE APPROPRIATE EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. IT WOULD HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FORCE THAT WE ARE ALL ONE STATE THAT WERE ALL RELATED AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FOREST IN THE SIERRAS. HAS AN IMPACT ON YOU IF YOU LIVE IN SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES SANTA MONICA SANTA BARBARA OR IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. THAT AND WITH THAT LET ME CONCLUDE BECAUSE WE HAVE. TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO I THINK PROBABLY HAVE. MUCH MORE IMPORTANT STUFF TO TALK ABOUT THAN I DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO JUSTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. YOU'RE WELCOME COULD YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND PUT MIKE JUST A LITTLE CLOSER TO YOU SO I'M JEFF CHAIRPERSON I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY IN THE GEOGRAPHY DEPARTMENT. AND ALSO FACTLY SCIENTIST AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. SO I BASICALLY STUDY HOW EXTREME EVENTS IMPACT FLORES. NO I'M PERMITTED OF CALIFORNIAN BUT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE I WAS LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS ON FACULTY AT TULANE UNIVERSITY. AND THIS IS WHAT PATRICIA LOOKED LIKE THE DAY BEFORE SHE MADE LANDFALL AT THE PRO RIVER. WHICH DEFINES THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN. LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI RIGHT THERE. SO. WHAT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE EXAMPLE OF THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND HER APPLYING THAT SOME OF THESE CALIFORNIA PROBLEMS? SO SUCH A WHAT WE DO IS WE USE BEFORE AND AFTER AN INJURY SO LET'S ZOOM INTO THE PRO RIVER RIGHT HERE. PRO RIVER PEARL RIVER. THAT'S BEFORE KATRINA MADE LAND FALL GREEN MEANS HEALTHY VEGETATION RED MEANS DEADWOOD DEAD VEGETATION. BEFORE. BEFORE. SUBTRACT THE IMAGES. YOU GET A DIFFERENT IMAGE HERE. MASK OUT ANYTHING THAT'S NOT FOREST ANYTHING THAT IT'S OF THE TEN COLOR. IS A FORCED IT PICKS UP. AS YOU CAN SEE RESOURCE IN BLUE NO IMPACT NONE OF THE TREES WENT DOWN. RIGHT NEXT DOOR THESE A. OAK MAPLE FORESTS COMPLETELY DESTROYED YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT HERE. CYPRESS TUPELO'S WHAT FOREST'S. OAK MAPLE FORESTS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. NOW. TO QUANTIFY THIS TO SAY HOW MANY TREES DIED AND HOW DOES THAT VERY SPATIALLY. WE NEED TO GET UP THE FIELD. AND THAT'S. SO DIFFICULT WORK. WE MEASURED MORE COUNTY DAMAGE RATES IN THE FIELD IS A FUNCTION. OF THIS CHANGE METRIC FROM SATELLITE AND TRIGGER A. WE PUBLISH THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN TWO YEARS AFTER KATRINA MADE LANDFALL IN SCIENCE. AND WE ESTIMATED HER PINKY TRINA KILLED OR SEVERELY DAMAGED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION TREES. TOOK US TWO YEARS TO DO THIS. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WE'RE USING SOME MODERN TOOLS? SO FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE HAS THIS PLATFORM CALLED EARTH ENGINE THAT'S PHENOMENAL. SO I HAD A STUDENT THAT JUST JOIN ME AGAIN WHAT I IN SEPTEMBER. AND I SAID HEY LET'S SO LET'S SPEND UP THESE TOOLS AND LET'S RUN IT THROUGH THIS EARTH ENGINE PLATFORM. TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF MARIA. MCCARTY RICO. JUST LIKE KATRINA BEFORE. AFTER. FOR AFTER. THE DISTURBANCE SO AGAIN ANYTHING IN COLOR IS FORESTED. THIS SHOWS THE IMPACT ACROSS ENTIRE ISLAND AND HOW THAT VERY SPATIALLY. THIS IS ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MILLION TREES WE WON'T KNOW PRECISELY UNTIL WE DO THE FIELD WORK. TO KIND OF INFORMED THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THE SATELLITES ARE TELLING US AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. SO. WHEN I WAS TO PROVIDE THIS TESTIMONY. AND I WAS SITTING NEXT TO MY STUDENT AND I ACTUALLY ANOTHER WE WERE HAVING LAST WEEK I SAID WELL WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THIS TOOL. HERE. THAT WE HAVE DONE FOR FEDERICO. AND THAT SHOULD SHIFTED OVER TO. THE THE FIRES HERE THE TUBS. THE. NUNS IN THE ATLAS FIRES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT. IT JUST MAPPED OUT RIGHT AWAY YOU COULD PUT THAT MAP OVER A BASE MAP YOU KNOW HERE'S HERE'S THE EIGHTY THAT I DROVE FROM BERKELEY HAVE TO HEAR THIS MORNING. I KNOW WHAT I ONE HEADING NORTH OF HERE SANTA ROSA. BALLOT ZOOM INTO THIS REGION RIGHT HERE. JUST LIKE A NUMBER OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WERE DESCRIBING. THIS VEGETATION URBAN INTERFACE IT CAN GET REALLY COMPLEX THE WAY THOSE FIRES SPREAD. AND THE WAY THEY INTERACT WITH THESE COMMUNITIES YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE HOMES JUST RIDLEY DESTROYED IN THIS REGION. WHERE THE FIRE JUMPED THE ONE A ONE? THIS REGION A FOUNTAIN GROWTH HERE. AND THESE TOOLS CAN BE BEFORE PROVIDED WITHIN. PROBABLY A WEEK OR TWO OF THIS THESE EXTREME EVENTS USING THESE MODERN TOOLS. SO. DIDN'T. TO THE PURE THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO FOCUS ON SO HOW THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGING WELL. THE TEMPERATURES ARE JUST GOING TO RISE AND WE'VE JUST SEEN THE BEGINNING OF ITS ACCELERATING AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING NOW IS JUST THE START. AND. WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT MORE OF THESE TEMPERATURE CHANGES THAT THE TRICKY THING IS IS THAT PRECIPITATION CAN KIND OF GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE GLOBAL CIRCULATION MODELS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TWENTY SIXTY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE PREDICTING THAT NOT ONLY IS GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER BUT A LOT DRIER IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR YOU KNOW SNOWPACK AND OTHER. PROCESSES BUT ALSO FOR METALLIC SO. TREE MORTALITY SO THIS IS THE ENTIRE SCARED ABOUT US OF FEAR ABOUT ARRANGE ANOTHER STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR IT'S IT'S A PROJECT THAT'S FUNDED BY SOME SEED MONEY FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. USING THAT SAME EARTH ENGINE PLATFORM IN SOME OTHER ANALYTICAL TOOLS WE'VE MAPPED OUT THE ENTIRE HEARING ABOUT IT AGAIN. THESE THIS THIS THIS THE REDNESS HERE INDICATES. DISTURBANCE INDICATES TREE MORTALITY. IF WE ZOOM INTO THIS REGION RIGHT HERE. THAT CENTERED ON WHAT VOTER. YOU SEE BURKE IT'S GOT SOME CABINS ACTUALLY THE UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA'S GOT SOME CABINS OUT HERE. WE HIKED UP THIS TRAIL RIGHT HERE THIS IS CHILDREN WATERFALLS. AND THEN WE LOOKED OUT. OVER HERE TO JUST SAY SO WHAT DO THESE PATCHES. LOOK LIKE IN THE FIELD. HIKE UP THE STEEP SIDE HERE OUT THE CHILL THE WATERFALLS AND I TOOK THIS PICTURE. SO SHOWING THE SWATHS HERE WERE EVERY TREE WAS DEAD. AND RIGHT NEXT DOOR. A HEALTHY STAND. IT'S IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHY IS IT THAT THESE TREES ARE DYING IN THE STREETS ARE. AND SO THAT'S THE OTHER. OF THE WORK THAT WE DO. MY LABORATORY AT A BERKELEY LAB IS. YOU KNOW GETTING INSIDE THESE PLANTS AND FIGURING OUT HOW THE DEFENDING THEMSELVES. WHY IS IT THAT SOME TREES CAN RESIST THESE EXTREME EVENTS WHILE OTHERS COULD SUCCUMB? IF SOMEBODY MENTIONED BEETLES IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE VOLATILE ISOPRENOID. ACT AS ANTI OXIDANTS IN PLANTS THEY TRY TO THINK THEY PRODUCE THOSE CUT OUTS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM OXIDATIVE STRESS. JUST LIKE PEOPLE DO. BUT IT TURNS OUT THE INSECTS CAN TARGET AND AND SINCE THAT SIGNAL AND SENSE WEAKNESS AND I CAN KIND OF ACCELERATE. THE DEMISE OF THOSE TREES. SO THAT'S ANOTHER. PART OF OUR RESEARCH. PROGRAM IS BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHY SOME TREES SURVIVE WHAT OF THE THRESHOLD FROM STRESS TO DEATH. AND. AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAD A FEW COMMENTS ON FORCE MANAGEMENT. IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST REALLY I MEAN IF YOU LIKE I JUST SAW. A KIND OF A GRAPH OF THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE ACROSS THE PLANET FROM EIGHTEEN FIFTY TO THE CURRENT JUSTICE THE SERIES OF IMAGES AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE ACCELERATION OF THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND WE'VE SEEN WHAT. TWENTY PERCENT OF WHERE WE'RE HEADED. YEAH IT'S IT'S A LOT OF INERTIA IN THE EARTH SYSTEM. AND SO IT'S A. VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEM. AND THEN AS YOU KNOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE EDUCATION SERVICE FIELD. FOR THESE FACTORS. SO BEING ABLE TO MATHIS OUT AND BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU KNOW THAT GET VEGETATION AND THE WITH AND AND THESE CLARA HIGH HIGH HIGH HIGH VELOCITY WINDS. INTERACT WITH OUR URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IT'S CHALLENGING THAT AT SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE NEW TOOLS CAN CUT OFF I THINK HELP US TO. BETTER. PLAN. FOR WHAT'S WHAT'S WHATEVER WAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND TO FINALLY HAVE TIME WERE LYNSKEY WITH US FOR SERVICE. WARNING TOMALIN SKI SENIOR METEOROLOGIST WITH THE US FOREST SERVICE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. PEOPLE. SOME GOING TO BE PRESENTING. THE JUST A SHORT PRESENTATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THAT WILL BE AFFECTING OUR FIRE SEASONS IN THE FUTURE. I WANTED TO FIRST START OUT PRINT WITH TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS TALKING ABOUT A WHAT HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED. OUR OUR CLIMATE IS DEFINITELY CHANGING THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT WE'VE I CAN NOT ONLY SEE THAT WITH THE DATA BUT WE ALSO EXPERIENCE THAT. I USE THIS PARTICULAR. LOCATION UP BECAUSE I WORK IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA BEEN WORKING THERE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS OUT WHAT YOUR SCENE IS. PRECIPITATION. TOTALS EARLY TOTALS ARE GOING BACK TO NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE SO WE HAVE NINETY TWO YEARS OF. OF UP PRECIPITATION OUR RECORDS FOR THIS LOCATION AND IT'S HARD TO SEE WITH THE. THE THE ACTUAL VARIABILITY IN THE HIGH ANNUAL PRECIPITATION OTHERS A LOT OF VARIABILITY IT'S OUR IT'S IT'S HARD TO SEE THE ACTUAL TREND. ARE OVER THE LAST NINETY TWO YEARS. BUT THERE IS A TREND. AND IT'S A SLIGHT DOWNWARD TREND OF ABOUT THREE INCHES OVER THE LAST. THAT AGAIN NINETY TWO YEARS. NOW AVERAGES ARE A TRICKY THING BECAUSE THERE. BASICALLY MADE UP NUMBERS THEY'RE MADE UP OF. THE. HIGHS AND LOWS SO AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABILITY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. OF BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE AVERAGES HAVE GONE DOWN OVER THE LAST. APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED YEARS AFTER THAT THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION THERE'S A REASON WHY I'M SHOWING YOU THIS. INITIALLY HERE. SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK LOOK AT THE AND I'M GONNA GO THROUGH THESE. MAPS YOU'RE QUITE QUICKLY UP THE MAP ON THE LEFT IS SHOWING WHEN WE LOOK AT CLIMATE WE LOOK AT THIRTY YEAR BLOCKS OF DATA AND SO. ABOUT WHAT THE MAP ON THE LEFT IS SHOWING IS A THIRTY YEAR BLOCK FROM NINETEENTH OF FIFTY TO NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND THEN ANOTHER BLOCK FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TO TWO THOUSAND TEN SO ARE WE COMPARED AND THIS IS ACTUAL DATA SO WE COMPARED THOSE TWO CLIMATOLOGICAL PERIODS. SO OLD ESSENTIALLY A SIXTY YEAR PERIOD HOW PRECIPITATION IS CHANGED AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN QUITE A BIT DRIER ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN A LITTLE WETTER ACROSS THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE STATE AND THIS IS THIS IS THESE ARE ACTUAL RECORDS. SO THAT'S INTERESTING THAT'S TO NOTE THAT BUT YOU CAN SEE THE EXTREME DRYNESS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. THEN THE OTHER TWO MAPS THERE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF SORT OF THE WAY THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE IS SAME TIME PERIOD DOING THE SAME THING. ARE EXCEPT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS SO YOU CAN SEE. A LOT AREAS PARTICULARLY CROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE GOTTEN WARMER OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS A LITTLE WETTER CROSS OF THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE STATE OPTICALLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND NORTH OF THE BAY AREA AND IN THE FAR RIGHT MAP THERE IS THE SAME THING EXCEPT LOOKING AT MINIMUM TEMPERATURES DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. SO YOU CAN SEE OVERALL WE'VE SEEN MINIMUM TEMPERATURES INCREASING A SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OVER THE LAST. SIXTY YEARS. SO WHAT I'M GONNA GO THROUGHNOW IS JUST THAT AGAIN VERY QUICKLY HERE LOOKING THAT A A FEW SLIDES OF. A CLIMATE CHANGE OR HOW ARE CLIMATE WILL BE CHANGING. ANTICIPATED CHANGES OVER THE NEXT OF FIFTY YEARS OR SO. I WENT THERE WHEN THE STATE JUST ON THE. VERY BEGINNING HERE IS THAT. THERE ARE MANY MANY CLIMATE MODELS WE HAVE AT LEAST THIRTY. GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN STATISTICALLY DOWNSCALED TO DIFFERENT REGIONS. FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY WE'VE SIMPLIFIED THE TH THE THIRTY MODELS WE'VE KIND OF BOILED IT DOWN TO TEN MORE COMMON MODELS. AND WE'VE USED AN UNSOLVABLE APPROACH SO BASICALLY WILL WILL BE LOOKING THAT ARE THE RESULT OF AN ENSEMBLE A A TEN MEMBER ENSEMBLE. OF RESULT HERE ARE AVERAGE. SO THIS IS A PROJECTED. ANNUAL PRECIPITATION BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTY FIVE. AND AGAIN THIS IS A SUMMATION OF TEN CLIMATE MODELS IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT THOSE MODELS INDIVIDUALLY THERE WOULD ACTUALLY BE DIFFERENT RESULTS. NOT NOT TOO DIFFERENT BUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE MEMBERS. ARE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY SAY THERE'S A LOT OF VARIABILITY WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE CLIMATE MODELS I THINK SOME PEOPLE FAIL TO SHOW SHOW THAT. BUT. AGAIN THIS IS THE. ON AVERAGE HERE OF THE TEN. AND SOME OF THEM MEMBERS SO AGAIN SHOWING ARE BASICALLY GETTING WARMER ACROSS I'M SORRY GETTING DRIER CROSS OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE AND ACTUALLY THIS IS SHOWING. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE GETTING WETTER ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS IS OVER A PERIOD OF ABOUT FIFTY YEARS. AND DOES THE TERM WETTER MEANS SNOW AND RAIN. HE OF PRECIPITATION SO YES AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THAT WOULD MEAN MORE SNOW. SO WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH ARE. WITH REGARDS TO OUR FIRE SEASONS AS I WANTED TO BREAK THIS DOWN INTO THE SPRING MONTHS IN THE FALL MONTHS LOOKING THAT APRIL MAY JUNE PERIOD. SAME THING TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTY FIVE SAME AND SOME ALL. MEMBERS HERE AGAIN SHOWING DRIER CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH AND ESSENTIALLY WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS A MUCH OF CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOW THIS IS. JERRY NOW THAT WAS DURING THE SPRING MONTHS THIS IS DURING THE FALL MONTHS. SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER. AGAIN DRYER NOW HERE OVER MUCH OF OF THE STATE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REALLY THE NORTHERN A QUARTER OF NO MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE STATE. AND THERE'S A REASON WHY I AM SHOWING YOU THIS AT ALL OMINOUS SUM ALL THIS UP HERE IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. BUT THIS IS LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES. MEAN MAXIM TEMPERATURE MEAN MINIMUM TEMPERATURE. YOU CAN LOOK IT UP ARE OUR. LARGE VARIETY OF THESE. OF OF DIFFERENT MAPS DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. DIFFERENT. TIMES OF THE YEAR THIS ISN'T A VERY OF IT'S JUST SHOWING YOU A VERY SIMPLE APPROACH HERE BUT ESSENTIALLY. ALL THE CLIMATE MODELS ARE SHOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WARMING UP AS JEFF IT. JUST MENTIONED HERE ARE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THERE'S. STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THIS. THAT OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS WILL BE WARMING UP NOT ONLY OUR MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES BUT OUR MINIMUM TEMPERATURES AS WELL. AND AGAIN I'M GONNA KIND OF SUM ALL THIS UP HERE KEVIN PAUL THIS TOGETHER IN JUST A MINUTE. OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MONSOON THE NAM. I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS THIS CIRCULATION SYSTEM THAT DEVELOPS ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. OVER THE SUMMER TIME AND OF BASICALLY BRINGS OUR LIGHTNING ACTIVITY TO CALIFORNIA OTHER RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE NORTH AMERICAN MONSOON WILL HAVE A WEAKER SIGNAL OVER THE COMING DECADES ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. WHAT IS THAT IMPLY THAT IMPLIES THAT WE'LL BE SEEING LESS LIGHTNING ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA IN THE DECADES AHEAD? I THOUGHT THIS IS FIRE ACTIVITY. AGAIN. JUST SHOWING THE FACTS HERE THAT ARE THIS IS NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED OVER THE LAST SIXTY YEARS. ACTUALLY THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS GOING BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY YOU CAN SEE THERE IS DEFINITELY BEEN AN UPWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED BY WILDFIRES. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE TAKE THAT SAME DATA AND JUST APPLY A. A TREND. BASED UPON THE. THE CURRENT TREND YOU CAN SEE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR IN THE YEARS AHEAD. ARE IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED. OKAY SO HERE'S WHERE I WANNA COME TO PULL ALL THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT SHOWED A LOT OF. DIFFERENT MAPS AND AND. FIGURES AND SO FORTH ONE OF THE FACTS IN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THAT. WILL IMPACT OUR FIRE SEASONS IN THE FUTURE. WHAT ARE THE FACTS THE FACTS ARE THAT MAXIM MINIMUM TEMPERATURES ARE IN IT THAT? THEY'VE BEEN INCREASING OVER THE LAST. SIXTY YEARS WE SEE THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN MEASURE THAT WE EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN. WE ALL KNOW IT'S GETTING WARMER. IT'S GETTING DRIER ACROSS. MANY PARTS OF CALIFORNIA CHECK WITH THE NORTHERN PART CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AGAIN WE EXPERIENCE THAT WE KNOW THAT'S TRUE. OF THE NUMBER OF ACRES BURNED I JUST SHOWED YOU ON THAT'S A FACT THEIR NUMBER OF ACRES ARE INCREASING A DETOUR WILDFIRES THAT ARE BEING BURNED. HERE'S WHAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT. IS THAT MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES ARE HUMAN CAUSED. OKAY I'M INTO. BRING THIS HOME HERE IN JUST A SECOND. ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF OUR WILDFIRES IN THE SIERRA AND EVEN MORE OF A HIGHER PERCENTAGE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE CAUSED BY LIGHTNING BUT BY AND LARGE MOST OF OUR FIRES ACROSS THE SORT OF THE THE. MORE POPULATED AREAS OF CALIFORNIA ARE HUMAN RELATED. SO HERE'S SOME QUESTIONS SENATOR. BECAUSE MOST OF ARE WILD FIRES ARE HUMAN RELATED. HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE? AND EVEN WITHOUT CLIMATE CHANGE HOW ARE THESE THINGS GOING TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. OUR POPULATION ACROSS THE STATE THE DEMOGRAPHICS. HUMAN BEHAVIOR HOW WILL CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS HUMAN BEHAVIOR ARE CONDO ME. OTHER TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN CHANGES TO THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE REGIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA HOWARD THOSE THINGS GOING TO CHANGE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE DECADES AHEAD CLIMATE CHANGE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THAT. BUT REGARDLESS THOSE THINGS WILL CHANGE REGARDLESS OF OF WHETHER WE HAVE A CHANGES IN OUR TEMPERATURE PRECIPITATION AND SO FORTH. THESE ARE THESE CHANGES ARE GOING IN OUR POPULATION HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE. OUT WHERE PEOPLE MOVE. A ARE GOING TO IMPACT OUR FIRE SEASONS IN THE FUTURE. IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. SO. ARE JUST LOOKING AT SOME ASSUMPTIONS SO WE CAN MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON WHAT WE A CAN ANTICIPATE WITH. A CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION THE REASON WHY I SHOWED YOU. WHAT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF MY PRESENTATION? IS THAT IT GIVES CREDENCE TO A CREDIBILITY TO. ALL OF THESE CLIMATE MODELS THAT ARE PROJECTING THESE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE THAT NOT ONLY GETS ITS CONTEXT BUT IT ALSO GIVES US. A CREDIBILITY FOR THESE CLIMATE MODEL SO ESSENTIALLY AGAIN MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES ARE PROJECTED TO BE INCREASING ACROSS THE REGION. OUR ANNUAL PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE. AND ACTUALLY INCREASE OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF THE SPRING AND THE FALL MONTHS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DRIER OVER SOMETHING OF SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE STATE. THE NORTH AMERICAN MONTHS SINCE SIGNAL IS. EXPECTED TO BE WEAKER WITH WEST OF LIGHTNING ACTIVITY. DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS OTHER DROUGHT FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY MAY INCREASE OUR TREE MORTALITY MAY BECOME MORE COMMONPLACE. IN FUEL LOADING MAY INCREASE IN THE NORTH. BUT DECREASE IN THE SOUTH SO THERE'S A LOT OF. LIKE CITY TO. TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CUT AND DRY. SO THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE HERE. CONCLUSIONS I THINK THE LENGTH OF OUR FIRE SEASON. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT BEING AS SEEN IT INCREASING I THINK IT'S GOING TO INCREASE FURTHER IN THE SOUTH. DOES THAT MEAN EVERY FIRE SEASON FROM HERE ON OUT IS GOING TO BE WORSE THAN THE NEXT NOW. WE'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO SEE THOSE. THAT VARIABILITY CONTINUE BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE AN UPWARD TREND I THINK IN IN TERMS OF OUR FIRE SEASONS BECOMING LONGER. OPTICALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE NGUYEN RELATED WILDFIRES DURING THE FALL MONTHS OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHY DO I SAY THAT BECAUSE WE LOOKED AT THOSE CLIMATE MODELS. AND THEY'RE PROJECTING DRIER CONDITIONS IN THE FALL DURING A ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. SO OUR SANTA ANA WINDS ARE A FREQUENT VISITOR. TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE FALL. SO WE WOULD IMPLY THIS WOULD IMPLY THAT WE WOULD SEE MORE NGUYEN RELATED FIRE ACTIVITY IN THE FALL AND SO THE CALIFORNIA. OTHER WEIGHT THE FIRE SEASON NAY CHANGED LITTLE IN THE NORTH BECAUSE. IT. OF THE PROJECTED WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OTHER MAYBE FEWER LIGHTNING RELATED FIRES IN THE SIERRA AND OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE SEVERE FIRES IN THE SOUTH. THAT'S POSSIBLE DUE TO DRIER FUEL CONDITIONS AND FIRE BEHAVIOR. MAY BECOME MORE EXTREME ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH AGAIN JUST DUE TO THOSE CRIER FUEL CONDITIONS A SCENE ACTIVITY LIKE A WHAT WE DID IT WITH THE THOMAS FIRE. AND SOME OF OUR. STATION FIRES ANOTHER. EXAMPLE. OF SOME SIGNIFICANT FIRE ACTIVITY IN THE SOUTH. AND THAT'S THE END OF MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH COME ALL REPRESENTATIONS OF BEEN VERY. HELPFUL AND TO PROVIDE US WITH A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT THAT THAT WE NEED TO TO MOVE FORWARD DATA MS LIMO DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THEN WHY DON'T WE. EXCUSE OUR PANEL AND ASK IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. GO RIGHT AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON. PAUL MASON AT THE STATE FOREST TRUST NICE WANTED TO REINFORCE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I THINK CAN GET. QUITE ENOUGH ATTENTION DURING THE EXCELLENT PRESENTATIONS EARLIER. ONE IS THAT ASWE'RE LOOKING AT OUR FORESTED LANDSCAPES AGO AS WELL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE WAY TOO MANY SMALL TREES NOT NEARLY ENOUGH LARGE TREES. YOU KNOW CONSEQUENCES THE PAST MANAGEMENT FIRE SUPPRESSION. AS WE'RE GOING IN AND THINNING AND DOING OTHER THINGS TO READ PRESCRIBED FIRE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SMALL TREES. IT'S GONNA TAKE A DELIBERATE. INTERVENTION TO MITCHELL ACTUALLY RECRUITING LARGE TREES AS WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BY MAGIC THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO REAP. WORK WITH LANDOWNERS TO DEVELOP THAT CHARACTERISTIC ON THE LANDSCAPE. AND THAT CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LONG TERM WATERSHED FUNCTION I THINK WITH THIS LAST PRESENTATION REALLY HIT HOME. IS WE REALLY NEED TO GET THESE WATERSHEDS WHERE IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE THE MOISTURE IN THE FUTURE INTO THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITION IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME SECURITY ABOUT WERE CALIFORNIA'S WATER CAN BE COMING FROM. BY THE SECOND HALF OF THE CENTURY BECAUSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE WARMER AND THINGS ARE IN THE DRYER. AS WE'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR ALL OF THESE. LARGE SCALE PROJECTS YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THE MY ORGANIZATION PACIFIC FOR STRESS DOES A LOT OF IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN THE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT STABLE AND PREDICTABLE. WHEN THERE'S MONEY ONE YEAR IN THE NOT MONEY THE NEXT YEAR. GETTING TO A POINT WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE DEDICATED STATE RESOURCES FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM OVER THEM COMING. FRANKLY DECADES IS GONNA BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND LASTLY I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT. A THESE ARE ALL FOREST FIRES AS MS LIMON POINTED OUT LOVE THIS HAPPENS AND AREAS OF THE STATE THEY'RE DOMINATED BY CHAPARRAL AND GRASSLAND DINO FRANKLY THE FIRES AND NAPA WERE LARGELY THAT CONTEXT AS WELL. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE GETTING A GRIP ON ALL OF THE HOMES THAT ARE OUT THERE NOT AS SORRY AREAS IN THE WILD LANDS. THAT YOU KNOW HAVE WOOD SHAKE ROOFS IN THESE OTHER HIGH RISK CHARACTERISTICS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND HOMES THAT ARE. NOT DEFENSIBLE AND SO THAT IS THE PART OF THINKING AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TO I AARON READ REPRESENTING CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE. HAVE PROUDLY NOW FOR FORTY YEARS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING I LOOK FORWARD BRINGING SOME OF OUR FIREFIGHTERS TO TESTIFY WHEN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET IS OUT. OF A IN IN THE HEARINGS COMING FORWARD. OF WOULD LIKE TO JUST VERY QUICKLY SAY WE'RE DOWN OVER SIXTY ENGINES FROM JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. I REMEMBER THE DAYS ONLY HAD FIVE WHAT WE CALL FIVE OH STAFFING JUST FIVE FIREFIGHTERS ON AN ENGINE. OF THAT DROPPED TO FOUR THEN IT DROPPED THREE INSTRUCTED TO. A AND WE TRY TO HOLD A MINIMUM OF TWO BUT FOR FOR OVERSTAFFED EGGMAN FIRE ENGINES IS IS PROBABLY. A A GOAL THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND YEAR ROUND STAFFING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME PRETTY ESSENTIAL A I THINK THIS PAST YEAR HAS PROVEN THAT. AS I LOOK FORWARD A TALKING TO WHEN YOU GET IN THE BUDGET LATER ON AND THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VARIOUS JULIAN ALLEN OWSKI BALL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE I TO ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING TODAY ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED IS ESSENTIAL TO HOW WE DEVELOP THIS. YOU KNOW THE POLICY CHANGES WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE AB REPRESENTING THE BIO ENERGY INDUSTRY. JUST IS IS A PRETTY NARROW PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST ONE OF THROUGH IT ON THE TABLE AS WE EXPLORE OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND YOU KNOW THE BY MASS INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY PROUD OF THE WORK IT'S BEEN DOING. IN RESPONSE TO THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS WE HAVE DEDICATED FACILITIES TAKING PRIMARILY DEDICATED FUEL FROM DEDICATED AREAS. IT IS PART OF THE LARGER SOLUTION ISN'T THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT DEADLY PART THE SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS MATERIAL. GETS OUT THE FOREST IF IT WEREN'T FOR THESE FACILITIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS THAT MATERIAL BE PILED AND BURNED. OR BE ELECTED AGREED IN THE FOREST AND THE FUEL FOR THE NEXT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THESE FACILITIES YOU KNOW UP CONTINUE TO PLAY THIS ROLE WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT LET'S INVOLVE A LITTLE THIS CONVERSATION. MOVE IT BEYOND THE TREE MORTALITY AND JUST SIMPLY TALK ABOUT FOREST HEALTH LIKE WE WERE DOING TODAY TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW ADJUSTING FOR OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SECURE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN THE GROUND TODAY FOR THE LONG TERM. AND THEN WE WOULD WE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT JUST US WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT FIRE PREPAREDNESS FIRE PREVENTION MANY THINGS THAT YOU HEARD TODAY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WE KNOW THAT THE THE LOCALS JUST LIKE AND CAL FIRE IS AS ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND WE SUPPORT THAT AND BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE. IT'S GOING TO BE LOTS OF TOOLS WORKING ON THIS TOOL SHED TED TO GET US INTO A BETTER CLIMATE FUTURE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK DURING THIS HEARING I'M AARON EVANS BUT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AS YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE COMBINED WILDFIRES IN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER WERE THE MOST DEVASTATING IN STATE HISTORY. AND. AND AND FIRST I THINK WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE AT THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS STATEWIDE AND FROM AFAR. WHOSE WORK HAS SAVED LIVES STILL RECOVERY ESTIMATES ARE IN THE BILLIONS AND CALIFORNIA CITIES WERE AFFECTED AN UNPRECEDENTED WAYS AS FIRE. TORE THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS. WELL THE LEAGUE CONTINUES TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT OF RECOVERY NEEDS. THE LEAGUE'S FIRE CHIEFS DEPARTMENT HAS IDENTIFIED A FEW CLEAR NEEDS TO PREVENT FUTURE DESTRUCTION. FIRST NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR RESIDENTS MADE COORDINATION. I'M WORD VERY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS. TO TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE I'M AND WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSIONS. SECOND THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM NEEDS MODERNIZING. FOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SUPPORT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT OF MUTUAL AID WAS SUPPLIED BY LOCAL AGENCIES. A THIRD FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT EQUIPMENT AND A STAFFING ARE AVAILABLE TO PRE POSITION BEFORE THE FIRE SPREAD THROUGH BEFORE FUTURE FIRES SPREAD THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS. THE LEAGUE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE COALITION TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL BUDGET RESOURCES FOR THAT. AYE THESE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES TO THE TUNE OF A HUNDRED MILLION. AND FINALLY JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF MORE ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THIS HEARING. FIRST REPLACEMENT HOUSING WILL BE NEEDED. PARTICULARLY IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY IMPACTED AND SECONDLY TREE MORTALITY AS A MAJOR ISSUE IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATION SO THAT AND. QUANTIFYING THESE NEEDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. AND IS ON GOING PROCESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MIKE GARABEDIAN. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WE ORGANIZED GROUP OF FRIENDS OF THE NORTH FORK IN AMERICAN RIVER GROUP AND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS WE HAVE WORKED IT DILIGENTLY STEADILY. ATTEMPTING TO GET LAND USE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHERE AND HOW WE BUILD. A AND I IT IT'S JUST A FACT THAT MANY LOCAL DECISION MAKERS DON'T SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY WITH THEIR DECISION. OF AYE I'M GONNA MAKE FOUR FIVE QUICK POINTS AND THERE ARE LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR FUTURE AGENDA SETTING IF WE CAN. IN IN LATE TWENTY FIFTEEN OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL HOOVER THEN FIRE MARSHAL WHO WERE MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE WE BUILD AND I COMMEND JON PARIS TODAY FOR BASICALLY. MAKING CLEAR THAT THAT IS SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU DO NOT HEAR THAT A VERY VERY OFTEN FROM STATE GOOD GOVERNMENT SAYS IT IS STATE OFFICIALS SO I'M VERY GRATIFIED TO HEAR THAT HERE. A SEQUEL SEQUENCE OF DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND I'VE SEEN MANY SECRET DOCUMENTS AND IF IF THERE ARE ANY THAT NEED STREAMLINING THOUGH THEY ARE ALREADY STREAMLINED WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE HAZARDS AND PLANNING FOR FIRE HAZARDS AND IN PARTICULAR. LIKE TO SLIDE YOU SING WE'VE NO I WAS A UPS A VOLUNTEER FIREMAN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK FOR WE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT FIRE BEHAVIOR AND WHAT IT DOESN'T WHERE YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BILL AND HOW IT AFFECTS HOW YOU DESIGN SUBDIVISIONS AND THAT KIND OF THING. WE'RE NOT APPLYING IT IN IN LARGE PART OF THAT HAS BEEN IT AND. WE DON'T NAY HARSH STREAMLINING WE NEED MORE CAREFUL APPLICATION EVERYTHING IN HERE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN A CESSNA HAD TIME IN THE. IN THE SOILS AND OTHER REPORTS AND DOCUMENTS. I'M NOW THE LAW IS PART OF THE PROBLEM I JUST GIVE ONE OF A NUMBER OF NEVER EXAMPLES THE BOARD OF FORESTRY HAVE AND YOU I'M SURE YOU HAVE MORE FIRE PREVENTION. ISSUE THE WORK IN YOUR FUTURE HEARINGS THE BOARD OF FORESTRY NOW REVIEWS THE SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THE NEW SAFETY ELEMENTS OF GENERAL PLANTS NOW WHERE DID THEY DO THIS. THEY DO IT IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREAS AND AS DEFINED BY STATE LAW. THEY DON'T DO IT IN HIGH FIRE HAS ITS VERY ERRORS THEY DON'T DO IT IN MONEY BECAUSE THE LAW DOESN'T PERMIT THEM TO DO THAT AND AND THAT'S JUST. ONE EXAMPLE I COULD GO AND OTHERS AND I WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THAT WITH YOUR STAFF. WANNA POINT OUT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE SHEET CHIEFS FOR EVERY YEAR NOW FOR NEVER USES HAD THEIR ANNUAL WE CONFERENCE IN RENO IS COMING UP IN A WEEK OR TWO. A VERY GOOD PLACE TO GO THEY HAVE A TWO DAY WORKSHOP THERE AND THINK STRUCTURE IGNITION THAT EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S SORT OF VARIOUS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THEY DID SEEM TO DO MORE LAST YEAR IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND WHAT WHAT PEOPLE BUT WHAT STATES AROUND THE WEST ARE DOING IN TERMS OF. OF FIRE PREVENTION PLANNING SO. ONE THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING I LEARNED A LOT TODAY AND HOPE TO BE MORE INVOLVED. GOOD AFTERNOON.
