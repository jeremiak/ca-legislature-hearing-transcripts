THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND THAT'S RESOURCES WORKING ON FROM OF PLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT FORREALLY QUITE SOME TIME THIS IS A B. SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT OR BETTER WAYS THAT WE CAN START TO TAKE MICROFIBRES OUT OF THE SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT. WASHING MACHINES DRYERS THAT THE PROCESS OF CLEANING. CLOTHING BETTER MADE FROM NON NATURAL FIBERS THAT BREAKS DOWN AND WE GET MICROFIBERS EVERYWHERE AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT IN THIS BILL IS STATE OWNED WASHING MACHINES BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO ATTACH FILTERS TO THOSE IN BECAUSE THEY ARE WASHING MACHINES ARE MANAGED BY EMPLOYEES AND PROFESSIONALS WE OBVIATE THE NEED. FOR THE MORE OBVIOUS THE CONCERN FOR NOT HAVING APPROPRIATE MAINTENANCE ON THOSE FILTERS SO I THINK THIS IS A- IMPORTANT STEP AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND. THE ISSUE OF MICROFIBERS HOW THEY GET OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT GOING THROUGH WASTE TREATMENT PLANTS AND OUT THROUGH SOME OF THESE PROCESSES AND THINK THIS BILL IF WE CAN GET THIS ENACTED WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SHOWING HOW THESE KINDS OF FILTERS DO WORK WOULD WORK. WHAT THE MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND THE OTHER ISSUES ARE AROUND THEM SO THAT I ASK FOR YOUR ITEMS AND WITH ME IS CODY PHILLIPS OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE I BELIEVE ON THE TELEPHONE YEAH HE'S ON THE PHONE LINE SO- AT&amp;T OPERATOR- COULD YOU PLEASE HAVE CODY PHILLIPS SPEAK UP. CODY. YES YEP. THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON CHECK WORKING AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CODY PHILLIPS THE POLICY ANALYST FOR CALIFORNIA CUT DEEPER ALLIANCES SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR TODAY- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE DESCRIBED MICRO PLASTICS ARE EVERYWHERE. MULTIPLE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE OBSERVED THESE PLASTIC PARTICLES IN GUT BIOTA AIR WATER SEDIMENT AND MOST RECENTLY IN HUMAN BLOOD. WERE EVER SIGNED AS THE VOTE THEY HAVE FOUND THESE MICROPLASTICS AND MICROFIBERS ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION REPORTED PUBLIC. ONE WELL UNDERSTOOD POLLUTION PATHWAY FOR MICROFIBRES ESTHER WASTEWATER FROM WASHING MACHINES- BECAUSE MICROFIBERS OF THE PRODUCT OF A VARIETY OF SYNTHETIC TEXTILES EACH LOAD OF LAUNDRY CAN RELEASE UP TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION MICROFIBRES INTO THE ECOSYSTEM. AND BECAUSE THE SERVERS ARE SO SMALL MOST WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILTER THEM OUT OF WATER. AS A RESULT AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF MICROFIBERS PASTOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES EACH YEAR POLLUTING CALIFORNIA'S WATERWAYS. AND ONCE THEY ARE IN THE ENVIRONMENT MICROFIBERS COMMITTEE TO A VARIETY OF HARMFUL OUTCOMES. BALL THAT CAN INGESTED MICROPLASTICS CUTTING STARVATION AND REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES. EVEN WORSE THAT THE FARMERS DO NOT BIODEGRADE AND THEY COMBINED WITH CHEMICAL POLLUTANTS IN WATER- AND BIOACCUMULATE UP THE FOOD LAB. STUDIES HAVE BEEN INDICATED. THE MICROFIBERS AND UP IN OUR DRINKING WATER. SO CONTROL THIS WILL UNDERSTOOD POWER. THE REASON OCEAN BUT COUNT STATEWIDE MICROPLASTIC REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THESE MICROFIBER FILTRATION DEVICES ARE USED IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S WASHING MACHINES. THE FILTERS ARE READILY AVAILABLE AND ON THE MARKET AND CONSUMER SURVEYS INDICATE THAT THEY ARE POPULAR. ON THIS BILL IS A NO REGRETS ACTION THAT WOULD CAPTURE MICROFIBERS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT AND- FOR THAT REASON I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI ON A. B. U. SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CODY PHILLIPS- DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IN THE HEARING ROOM TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

ARE THAT WE CAN FIND THEM. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD STEP TO FIND OUT WHAT IS THERE. ARE THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE I KNOW I HAVE FRIENDS ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOMETHING TO MAKE. PLAST PUBLIC POLYSTYRENE BIODEGRADABLE BY ADDING A CHEMICAL COMPOUND. SO THERE ARE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AND WE DO NEED THEM BECAUSE THIS PROBABLY IS ENDING UP IN THE BIO SOLIDS IN THE SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANTS AND- HEY. WE AGAIN WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE RESEARCH AND UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE BUT IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE WE'RE SPREADING THOSE BIOSOLIDS AREAS IN PARTICULAR AND FROM THERE GOD KNOWS WHERE IT GOES. BUT I DON'T WANT TO EAT ANY- SO I RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO- BUT I. WILL UP WILL VOTE LATER AND- I THINK YOU'VE I THINK WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE BILL OUT THANK. GOD. RIGHT MISTER CALDERON. OKAY MISTER KALRA PLEASE PRESENT YOUR BILL- ONE OF MY FAVORITES- FLUORESCENT LAMPS SALES AND DISTRIBUTION OF PROHIBITION AND- EVEN BEFORE WE START- I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS- THIS BILL BANS MERCURY CONTAINING COMPACT THE LINEAR FLUORESCENT BULBS- SO PLEASE PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AT THE END MEMBER. I'D LIKE TO. I LIKE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN YOU STOP FOR THEIR WORK AND GUIDANCE ON THIS BILL AB TWENTY TO AWAIT WOULD PHASE OUT THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION AS A NEW MENU FAST FACTOR PRODUCT OF COMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMPS AND LINEAR FLUORESCENT LAMPS STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER OTHERS BILL WOULD EXEMPT CERTAIN SPECIALTY FLUORESCENT LAMPS INCLUDING THOSE USED IN IMAGE CAPTURE IMAGE PROJECTION AND DISINFECTION. WHILE THE REST OF MY AUNTS WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED AS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO INCANDESCENT LAMPS THERE ARE TWO KEY REASONS WHY THERE ARE THERE ARE NO LONGER THE BEST OPTION CALIFORNIA. FIRST OFF FLUORESCENT LAMPS CONTAIN MERCURY A POTENT TOXIN THAT CAN CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IT'S A FACTOR ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN CHILDREN. WITH FOREST LANDS ARE BROKEN THEY RELEASED AMERICA BE CONTAMINATING ONE ANYTHING IN THE VICINITY. WHILE THE STATE CATEGORIZE PRESS OF BOB'S AS HAZARDOUS WASTE MOST RESIDENTS ARE STILL DRAWN AWAY IN THE REGULAR TRASH WITH THE OFTEN BREAKING EXPOSES WORKERS. TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF MERCURY. SECOND FLORESCENT ONES ARE NO LONGER THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT BULBS ON THE MARKET MOKRI FREE LEDS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFICIENT THE FLUORESCENCE ONLY REQUIRING ABOUT HALF ELECTRICITY WHILE LASTING TWO TO THREE TIMES LONGER. FURTHERMORE THE PRICE ABILITIES IS DROPPING DISDAIN EXPECTED TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE COST OF PRESENTS. BY THE TIME THE BILL TAKES EFFECT. ADDITIONALLY THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS- TOWARDS BANNING FLUORESCENCE IS NOTHING NEW THE STATE OF VERMONT CURRENTLY PROHIBITS THE SALE COMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMPS IN THE E. U. IS PLAIN TO PAYS AT ALL GENERAL PURPOSE. FLUORESCENT LAMPS NEXT YEAR. AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT WILL ELEVATE CALIFORNIA THE LEVEL OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO REMOVE TOXIC INEFFICIENT FLUORESCENT BULBS FROM THEIR LIGHT FIXTURES. BY USHERING UP RUSSELL LANCE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW BETTER ALTERNATIVES TO LIGHT THE WAY TO A SAFER MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT FUTURE. WOULD BE PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ARE JORDAN WELLS DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL. ADVERTORIAL ROME DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. OR THIS ME GEORGE WELL ON THE PHONE LINE I BELIEVE YOU CAN JUST START TALKING. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU MEMBER KALRA CHAIR NUMBERS I AM JORDAN WELLS AT THE NATIONAL STORAGE OF ACTION COUNCIL A NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES PARTICULAR AN EQUITABLE ECONOMY AND THE FUNDS ARE EIGHTY TWO TWO ZERO EIGHT ALL PRESENT LAND CONTAINER CURE A POTENT NEUROTOXIN LISTED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION AT THE TOP TEN CHEMICAL A MAJOR. PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. HERE IN CALIFORNIA DOZENS OF WATERWAYS ARE ALREADY CAN SO CONTAMINATED WITH MERCURY THAT THE STATE WARNS CONSUMERS TO LIMIT THEIR CONSUMPTION OF FISH CAUGHT FROM THESE LAKES STREAMS AND RESERVOIRS. THE MERCURY IN FLUORESCENT LAMP IS CONTAINED ONLY BY FRAGILE GLASS THAT CAN AND DOES BREAK RESULTING IN MERCURY EXPOSURE AND THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO MERCURY. BREAKAGE CAN OCCUR AT ANY POINT IN A PRESS THAT LANCE LIFECYCLE DURING MANUFACTURING INSTALLATION COLLECTION TRANSPORT PROCESSING OR RECYCLING IRWIN IS LANDFILLED INCINERATED OR LEGALLY DOT. IF THIS MEASURE PASSES CALIFORNIA WOULD BE FOLLOWING THE TWENTY SEVEN COUNTRIES OF THE EU THAT UNDER. ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION HAVE ALREADY BANNED YES L. IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AND- LFL WILL BE BANNED IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. BERMAN HAS ALSO ALSO HAS A BAN ON THE COMPACT FLUORESCENT LAMPS THAT BEGINS IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE AND LAST MONTH DURING THAT MINIMIZE THE CONVENTION ON MERCURY IN BALI. ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO PHASE OUT THE CONTACT FOR COMMAND GLOBALLY BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE. AND HERE AT HOME CALIFORNIA SIXTY NUMBER STATEWIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION WHICH REPRESENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RETAILERS NONPROFIT AND UNIONS. VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO APPROVE A POLICY RECOMMENDATION STATING SOME PRODUCTS ARE JUST TALK SICK AND UNNECESSARY AND HAVE CHEAPER CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES MAKING THEIR- SALE UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY. FLUORESCENT LAMPS THAT THE CATEGORY AND WE RECOMMEND THAT CALIFORNIA BANNER FAILED TO STOP ADDING COSTLY DANGEROUS AND UNNECESSARY MERCURY IN THE HOMES AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TIME IS NOW FOR CALIFORNIA TO SAY FAREWELL TO TOXIC FOR. I LIKE TO THINK IT'S AN MEMBER. FOR HIS LEADERSHIP RESPECTFUL ASK FOR YOU TO FIGURE AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY TWO ZERO EIGHT THANK YOU. SO MS BROWN PLEASE HAVE BEEN ALREADY PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VICTORIA ROME WITH ENERGY C. NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL NICE TO SEE YOU ALL- AS STATED MERCURY'S A CHEMICAL OF SERIOUS CONCERN. AND IT'S YOU SHOULD BE LIMITED WHENEVER AND WHEREVER POSSIBLE. IN THE PAST DESPITE THEIR MERCURY CONTENT FLUORESCENT LAMPS WERE TOLERATED EVEN PROMOTED BECAUSE THEY WERE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT OPTION AT THE TIME ESPECIALLY COME WHEN COMPARED TO INCANDESCENT BULBS. BUT A LOT HAS CHANGED AND LEDS NOW USE ABOUT HALF THE ELECTRICITY IS FLUORESCENCE TO PRODUCE THE SAME AMOUNT OF LIGHT AND LAST TWO TO THREE TIMES LONGER. THEY'RE ALSO WIDELY AVAILABLE AND BECOMING MORE SO ALL THE TIME. UNLIKE FLUORESCENT LAMPS THEY DO NOT CONTAIN MERCURY OR RELEASE TOXIC VAPORS WHEN THEY BREAK. MAKING THE SWITCH TO LEDS IS BETTER FOR OUR HEALTH ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY ALSO HELPS WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SAVES CONSUMERS APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION EACH YEAR IF WE ARE TO MAKE THE FULL SWITCH- SAY SO AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT WILL REDUCE THE BURDEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH ARE LEFT WITH THE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TASK OF COLLECTING IMPROPERLY DISPOSING OF MERCURY CONTAINING FLUORESCENT LAMPS THE BILL WILL ALSO BOOST SALES FOR THE MORE THAN FIFTY MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF LED LIGHTING THAT ARE OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW IS THE TIME TO PHASE OUT THE SALE OF FLUORESCENT LAMPS THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU- THE SEARCH MEMBERS AB TWENTY FOUR FOURTEEN I'M HERE PERCENT AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTH FOURTEEN. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS BEFORE APPROVING AND BUILDING A NEW SCHOOL. PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS BEFORE BUILDING A NEW SCHOOL. AS A RESULT THERE ARE CASES IN CALIFORNIA OVER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN BUILT AND POTENTIALLY UNSAFE LOCATION NEAR SOURCES OF HAZARDOUS EMISSIONS SUBSTANCES OR WASTE FOR EXAMPLE IN FREMONT A PRIVATE SCHOOL WAS BUILT RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO A CEMENT PLANT EXPOSING THE CHILDREN AND STAFF TO HARMFUL. AIR TOXICS IN MY OWN BACKYARD AND CUT A HEY THERE WERE PLANS TO BUILD A NEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON LAND THAT CONTAINS TOXIC SUBSTANCES INCLUDING LEAD AND ARSENIC. AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN ENSURES THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL STUDENTS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA BY REQUIRING PRIVATE. AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY NEARBY SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION CONSULT WITH A LOCAL OR DISTRICT DETERMINE THAT A PROPERTY IS NOT HAZARDOUS IT'S NOT A HAVE TO STATE. OR STATE THAT CAN POTENTIALLY RELEASE HAZARDOUS EMISSIONS UP SENSORS OR WAIT THIS BILL SIMPLY CREATES PARITY- AND ENSURES THAT OUR EARTH STUDENTS THE MATTER OF THEIR AT A PUBLIC PRIVATE OR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE SAFE. FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE. SINCE ESPECIALLY AT I'VE WITH THE BAY AREA- QUALITY. DISTRICT TO TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. AND ON THE PHONE I HAVE AT LEAST CLOSE RIGHT DALY THE LAWYER FOR THE CUTTING ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CORK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ALLEN ABS LEGISLATIVE OFFICER WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN. WE THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN CURRENT LAW PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTING A NEW PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PUBLICLY FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOL. SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEVERAL ACTS OF DUE DILIGENCE TO BETTER ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THEIR FUTURE STUDENTS SCHOOL STAFF. THEY DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY TO BE BUILT UPON IS NOT A CURRENT OR FORMER HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE OR HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES RELEASE SITE. AND THEY CONSULT WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES AND MAKE A FINDING THAT THE HEALTH RISKS OR OTHER POLLUTION SOURCES. DO NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL ENDANGERMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PERSONS WHO WOULD ATTEND OR BE EMPLOYED AT THE SCHOOL. THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT OR AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. BY BY BO PERMITTED AND NON PERMITTED FACILITY WITHIN THAT DISTRICTS AUTHORITY. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FREEWAYS ANOTHER BUSY TRAFFIC CORRIDORS LARGE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. RAILYARDS ALL WITH IT AND- MY PROPOSED SITE THAT MIGHT REASONABLY ANTICIPATED BE ANTICIPATED TO EMIT HAZARDOUS AIR EMISSION. THIS IS BERMAN. YOU DEPRIVE. US IN ORDER. AND WHILE WE ARE NOT CLAIMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF SCHOOL ARE POORLY SET. INCREASING USE DENSITY IN RE PURPOSING INFILL THREE THE- THAT WITHOUT SIMILAR DUE DILIGENCE FUTURE SCHOOLS MAY BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE VICINITY OF POLLUTION SOURCES. UNNECESSARILY EXPOSE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND CREATE AN UNHEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT. AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN REQUIRES THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES TO ASSESS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE IN AIR POLLUTION CONDITIONS ON IN IN THE VICINITY OF THE POST SCHOOL. TOOK KNOWLEDGE OF THIS INFORMATION AND IF NECESSARY TO USE IT IN THEIR DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND CAN. THEIR ON BEHALF THEIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AT THE DATE AND THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER. BROUGHT THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU- VERY GOOD ND WE HAVE ONE OTHER. WITNESS A LEASE PERCENT DAILY- ATTORNEY FOR THE CUT HE ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE ON THE PHONE LINE POLICE IF YOU CAN JUST START SPEAKING WE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. THANK YOU HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBER. MY NAME IS COOPER DALY AND I'M WITH. A LOT. AFTER ALL RIGHT ENVIRONMENTAL AND DISCRIMINATION LAW FIRM. WELL CURRENT HELLO LAW BY THE REQUIREMENTS THE CLEANUP OF HAZARDOUS THREE ON PUBLIC BY AGENCIES THAT RICHARD OF THE BUT THERE'S BEEN YOU BRING ME READING BACK TO IT. NOT SO. WHAT CHARTER SCHOOL. MOST IMPORTANTLY BOB DEPARTMENT OF PROCTER. ALL HAVE BEEN FORWARDED TO THE REQUIRED NOT PUBLIC. IT IS NOT HAVE THE STATEMENT OR DEMOCRATS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. I CONSEQUENTLY. OKAY YEAH. GLUED TO THE FALL IN THE LOCK MY CLIENT HAD WOULD BE THE CITY DOING SURE IMPROVE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL OVERSIGHT OF THE PROPOSED. WELL WE PREVAILED ARE LOCKED YOU BY THAT. AND UNMANNED AND- I'M NOT VERY BY AND A FIGHTING THE ISSUE BROWN. THE CURRENT RECENTLY UNFAIRLY THE BURDEN OF IMPORT AND OVER I'M PRIVATE THEM AND BUILD. IMPACT INCOME COMMUNITIES. HOW ARE. LARGE OF BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN HAVEN'T BEEN COMPENSATION CHEN AND TALK IN. HI PAY FOR EXAMPLE- MAKING THE NINE SEVENTH BUT YOU NEED NOT IMPACT BY IN. THOUGH THE GET ONLY POINT WHERE MY- THIRTY AFRICAN THANK. AND I'M THE FIRE THE AGING PROCESS THANK 95% OF THE POPULATION HOW TO CREATE A BLACK. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AND WITHOUT MY FIRM PROVIDING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BUT ALL RIGHT THEY NEVER MET THE CHALLENGE. ALONG ZERO VIDAK PEOPLE ALL REMEMBER FOR IN OF ENSURING CORP I'M PRIVATE AND GRAPHICS HM IT WILL REQUIRE PRIOR AND CHARTER SCHOOLS RIGHT DOWN NEARBY AND LOOK. YEAH MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT YEAH YEAH JERK THANK BROWN THE- AND CLEAN UP OF HAZARDOUS LOOKS LIKE. HAD TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN A DOCTOR W. ACCOUNT MY CLIENT BUT NOW HAVE HAD OUR LAWSUIT AFTER. AND. THE REASON I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. YOUR SUPPORT I HOPE FOR A. TWENTY FOUR. A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- WE BELIEVE THAT THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE ON THE PHONE LINE HOOLAHAN IF YOU SPEAK UP WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. ON BEHALF OF PTSD AND SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN. PTSD IS A NONPROFIT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR TO ADDRESS THE SINGLE GREATEST HURDLE THAT FACE URBAN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THAT SECURING ADEQUATE FACILITIES. MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND DEVELOPMENT AS A CIVIL ENGINEER LAND SURVEYOR FORMER PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR IN THE CURRENT PLANNING COMMISSIONER. PROVIDE ME A SECOND SIGNIFICANT UNDERSTANDING OF THE LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESS AND AGENCIES DOCKING IMPACTS RESULTING FROM BURDENSOME PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS LOCAL AGENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTITLEMENT AND PERMITTING THAT INCLUDES EQUAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT THE PROCESS RESULTS IN FAVORITE COMPLIANT PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS LOCAL COMMUNITY CONCERNS AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN CHANGES TO THIS PROCESS CONFLICT WITH LOCAL MUNICIPAL CODES AND THAT DUPLICATED STATE LEVEL PROJECT. REVIEW SENATE REQUIREMENTS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE PROJECT AND TIME. MAKING IN OUR DIFFICULT PROCESS CHILD AND OVER. LOCAL AND AGENTS STAFF. IF ENACTED THIS BILL WILL HAVE A VERY REAL IMPACT FROM CURRENT P. CST PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE BE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL. WHICH HAS INITIATED AN ENTITLEMENT PROCESS TO DEVELOP A PERMANENT HOME FOR IT SCHOOL. SCHOOLS MOVED LOCATIONS MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES IN TWENTY ONE YEARS. THE STUDENT POPULATION IS MORE THAN 89% MINORITY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY AND THEIR GRADUATION RATE IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. THE PROJECT ENTITLEMENT INCLUDE SEQUIN VERY MENTAL SUBSTANTIVE AND SUCCESSFUL REDEVELOPMENT WILL BRING THIS FACILITY BACK TO LIFE BENEFITING THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE STUDENTS. AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEENTH NEW REQUIREMENTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE WILL CAUSE DELAY INCREASED COSTS MAKE THIS PROJECT NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY PRESENT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- NOW WE HAVE JOHN LANGER. THEIR DEMANDS NAME PENTAGON INTO TOWN. THANKS CHAIR MEMBERS- JOHN LINGER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION I THINK MITCHELL AND- HIGHLIGHTED A LOT OF THE EXISTING PROCESSES THAT WE GO THROUGH ON THE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE. TWO QUICK POINTS- ON THE BILL FIRST THERE CONTINUES TO BE AN ASSERTION THAT THIS BILLS SIMPLY BRINGS PARITY BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS BY- UP APPLYING THE SAME REQUIREMENTS STATE REQUIREMENTS TO THEM WHEN IT COMES TO SCHOOL CITING I WOULD SAY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MISLEADING CONSIDERING THE LOCAL RIGOROUS LOCAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. PLACING ADDITIONAL STATE REQUIREMENTS ON TOP OF THAT ACTUALLY CREATES FURTHER INEQUITY- AND NOT PARITY BETWEEN THE TWO- TYPES OF SYSTEMS- ED THEY LOCAL OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALSO YOU KNOW EXEMPTS FROM ALL THOSE LOCAL- REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ARE- SUBJECT ALSO MAKE THAT POINT. I'M AND THEN FINALLY- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ALSO GIVEN ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR FACILITIES- THEY HAVE ACCESS TO LOCAL AND STATE FOR- BOND FUNDING CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE VERY VERY RARELY EVER GIVEN THOSE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND WE PRIMARILY HAVE TO FUND ARE PROJECTS OUT OF- GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS ARE UP OUR GENERAL OPERATING BUDGET SORRY- AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO SPEND. OUT OF OUR GENERAL PRETTY BUDGET GETS TAKEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM AND SO I THINK WE CONVERSATIONS GOING ON FOR A COUPLE YEARS WE'VE BEEN VERY CONSISTENT IN OUR POSITION ON THIS IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE STATE REQUIREMENTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR OUR FACILITIES THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE A OVERSIGHT. FLEXIBILITY IT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS GET AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THOSE PROJECTS OR ELSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS- FACE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING THAT THEIR PROPERTIES AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN A POSITION- NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION YEAH YOU CAN SIT THERE IN CASE OUR QUESTION A PROBLEM. THERE BEING NO ONE IN THE ROOM WELL NOW ASK COULD BE EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR. TO ASK THOSE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN. TO GIVE US THEIR NAME OUR ORGANIZATION IF ANY AND THEIR POSITION ON AB. TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN- EIGHTEEN T. OPERATOR PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FOUR FOURTEEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN ZERO IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB. TWENTY FOUR FOURTEEN. AND ONE MOMENT FOR OUR FIRST. WHEN THEY WILL GO LINE EIGHTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN CORRECT. NINE ONE EIGHTY SIX. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI THIS IS A BACK ON FROM BOSTON LINK AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ITSELF. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE ONE NINETY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES MY NAME IS GEORGE BRED THEM A PROPERTY OWNER IN THE CITY OF CUTTING HAY AND I AM IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TO. FOUR. THANK YOU. AGAIN THAT IS AND- OPPOSITION. S. ONE AND THEN ZERO. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTER OPPOSITION IN KIEL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ARM LET'S SEE OUR QUESTIONS MISTER MAHER CG THANK YOU I- APOLOGIZE FOR. GETTING HERE A LATE AND SO I MAY HAVE MISSED SOME TESTIMONY BUT- THE QUESTION FOR THE BAY AREA HEY KIM D. IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY COVERED THIS ARM COULD COULD YOU OF- GIVE EXAMPLES OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT- THAT HAVE FOR A- HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH A HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE TAKE I KNOW THAT THERE'S ONE IN THE- SUMMER GARCIA'S DISTRICT CUTTING A TO- SPECIFICALLY IN. THE BAY AREA VACANTE IS. BUT YES ASSEMBLY MARTUCCI- SO OUR OUR ORIGINAL- WHAT. WHAT BROUGHT ABOUT THIS- THIS BILL PROPOSAL IN THE BAY AREA WHAT WASN'T A CHARTER SCHOOL WAS RESULT OF A PRIVATE SCHOOL CITING AND IN THE STREETS VERSION OF THIS IS A PRIVATE SCHOOL- COMPANY WANTED TO EXPAND THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL NETWORK THE PURCHASE TO INDUSTRIAL LAND. FROM INDUSTRIAL FACILITY THAT HAD A MET WITH THE AIR DISTRICT IT HAD A- A CEMENT PLANT IT HAD- ROB AND GRAVEL- OUTFIT IT HAD DEL A LANDSCAPING BUSINESS- THIS INDUSTRIAL FACILITY SOLD- LANDS TO THE PRIVATE SCHOOL COMPANY- THE- THE CITY. OF PLANNING TO. THE CITY OF. I IN IN OUR OPINION- ALLOWED THE THIS THE SCHOOL SITE TO BE BUILT WITHOUT WHAT WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CONTACT WITH THE AIR DISTRICT OR D. T. S. C. THE SCHOOL WAS BUILT AND PARENTS WERE THEN. ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN AND SAW THE OF THE SMOKESTACK FROM THE CEMENT PLANT AND INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS THAT WERE GOING ON BACKSTORY IN BRING RIPS UP. YOUR THE PUBLIC STARTED SHOWING UP AT THEIR TO MEETINGS IN DOING RESEARCH BUT WE JUST. TO OTHERS FIREMEN FOR FIRST PUBLIC SCHOOL WHICH DO NOT A FOR PRICE SCHOOL AND- CHOI SCHOOL. RELATED TO AN OF BEING ATTEMPT HE HAS THIS VISION YOUR RISK GOING TO BE BUILT INSIDE. SO THIS WILL COVER THAT THAT THAT IF THIS. LAW THAT. HAPPENED YES WE WOULD NEVER END AND THE QUESTION FOR THE CHARTIST- REPRESENTATIVE OF. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ZONING WAIVER AUTHORITY WHEREAS- COURSE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT. HOW DOES THAT- DOES THAT IN ANY WAY AFFECT. CHARTERS NOPE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS REQUIREMENT TO COMPLY WITH SYKORA- REQUIREMENTS. I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IN A MINUTE I'LL GO AHEAD MADE ME HAPPY GOOD WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL GOES FOR ENTITLEMENT YOU MUST GO THROUGH AN ENTITLEMENT PROCESS WE DON'T HAVE THE EXEMPTIONS THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE WHEN YOU GO TO THAT ENTITLEMENT PROSTITUTES USUALLY CONDITION USED HER OR SOMETHING OF THAT IT MUST COMPLY WITH EQUAL- WE- HAVE. MANY SIDE KERR GOING THROUGH IT AND TO IT VERY ROBUST PROCESS. IN IN ADDITION TO. THAT PROCESS YOU ALSO GET THE- A REQUIREMENT TO DEAL WITH THE CONCERNS OF THE LOCAL AREA WHICH HONESTLY PUBLIC SCHOOLS DO NOT COMPLY WITH THAT- YEAH I HAVE BEEN A FORMER PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR AND BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY MANY MANY. PROJECTS FROM THAT SITE AND READ OF FROM THE PUBLIC WORKS CAMPUS OF THIS DOCUMENTS AND- IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS COME IN BECAUSE YOU DO. GREAT EARLY YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK AGENCY IN ENTIRETY ALMOST- WHERE IS THE CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE PRIVATE DON'T THAT YOU ACTUALLY MUST COMPLY WITH ALL THE ISSUES FOUND. AND IT'S ERODING IS TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CLUB BECAUSE THEY DO. BUT I'M GOING TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL REPRESENTATIVE I MEAN THIS BILL IS PROPOSING THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE REQUIREMENTS- I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT HOW. CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN GO OUT FOR BONDS BUT IN TERMS OF ENSURING. THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE LOCATED IN SAFE LOCATIONS THE CHILDREN OF EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED IN SAFE LOCATIONS I. RIGHT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING WHY CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD NOT TO OR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SIXTEEN SAME STATE REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE IN ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE. SIDES YEAH I THINK IT'S JUST AN ISSUE OF- ADDITIONAL PROCESSES TO GO THROUGH- IF WE DIDN'T HAVE. THE LOCAL PROCESSES THAT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH SIMILAR TO THE WAY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AND WE JUST HAD A STATE. LEVEL REQUIREMENT SIMILAR TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAN IT BE A MUCH DIFFERENT CONVERSATION BUT PLACING A STATE REQUIREMENT IN A STATE PROCESS ON TOP OF IN ADDITION A EXISTING LOCAL PROCESS THAT TAKES QUITE A LONG TIME AS WELL. JUST CREATES FURTHER DELAYS AND- MORE TIME AND MORE MORE MONEY AND SO WE THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT STATE. REQUIREMENT THEN IT SHOULD BE- IN PARITY WITH WITH THE WAY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE TREATED. IN THIS LOW. VETERANS PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE- LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS. ALL THE ALL THE FOR TO MARRY- GRACE BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS ACCURATE I THINK THERE HAVE WHERE B- IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU- SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL REGULARLY STATE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT TO OR COMPLY. WITH LOCAL AGENCY AND THEY WILL. NOT SUBMIT TO THE LOCAL AGENCY FOR THE- AND THEY WILL IGNORE- THE LIST PROCESS HE- IT HAPPENS IT HAPPENS CONSTANTLY- THE CHARTERS IN THE PRIVATE. IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT YOU DON'T COMPLY WITH THE STATE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE YOU DO- BOTH. PROJECTS AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IS THERE A STATE- AT SCHOOL OR PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOL THEY START WITH PREPARING TO FACE ONE AND THAT GETS REVIEWED ENOUGH CAN IDENTIFY YOUR FIRST INITIAL ISSUES. AND THEN YOU GO ON IF THE IF THERE ARE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THAT PHASE ONE WHICH IS CONSULTANT FOR PAIRED ON BOTH SIDES. WHETHER IT'S GOING TO DGSE OR WHETHER IT'S GOING TO THE LOCAL AGENCY THE BENEFIT IS IF IT'S GOING TO A LOCAL AGENCY IT'S USUALLY HAS A SCOPE OF WORK FOR THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT. THAT WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE LOCAL AGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE DEVELOPER WOULD PAY FOR IT THE DEVELOPERS NOT OVERSEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT- THE CONTROL OF THAT CONSULTANT BY THE LOCAL AGENCY. LITTLE DIFFERENT. WITH DTS- EIGHT. PREPPER OF THAT DOC IS GONNA BE BY. THE QUOTE UNQUOTE DEVELOPER OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEN COMMITTED TO DGSE. BOTH WILL REVIEW THAT CASE ONE IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ARISE AND IT GOES TO THE NEXT UP. IN THE LOCAL AGENCY IF IT STARTS GOING TO STEPS IN IDENTIFYING. OF POLLUTANTS THAT ARE OVERSEEN BY THE- COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IN MANY H. AREAS. BECAUSE IT'S BEEN HOSTILITY. BY. PORTABLE BTC OR IT WILL GO D. T. WE CHARTERS THROUGH THE LOCAL. I ITEMS CAME UP AND THEY WERE REFERRED OVER TO DGSE AND DTC OVERSAW THE CLEANUP OF THE VERY S. THAT PROCESS IS IN PLACE- SO IT'S INTERESTING. THAT SOMEONE IS IMPLYING THAT IT'S NOT OKAY SO IN IT BOTTOM LINE ARE YOU SAYING THAT. TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE TO COMPLY. HADN'T HAVE TO COME WITH THE STATE REQUIREMENTS BUT NOT WITH LOCAL REQUIREMENTS WERE AS CHARTER SCHOOLS COMPLY WITH LOCAL REQUIREMENTS. AS CHARTER SCHOOL SHOULD GO IN MAY DAY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CHOIR WHICH IS STATE REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD WHICH IS STATE REQUIREMENTS. THEY HAVE TO ROUTE COMPLY WITH ALL THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN ADDITION THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LOCAL AGENCY REQUIREMENTS AS WELL YOU ALSO GET THE BENEFIT OF WHEN THEY PROCESS THROUGH LOCAL AGENCY. LOCAL AGENCY STAFF IS AWARE OF THE ISSUES THAT COME ABOUT LOCAL AGENCY DEALS WITH HOUSING PROJECTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND FISCALLY. THEY'RE DEALING WITH WITH THINGS READ MORE SENSITIVE- BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO SILLY- SO. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH A LOCAL AGENCY. HUMAX HAVE. A MORE THOROUGH AND ROBUST- REVIEW AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THAT COMMUNITY IN AND AROUND THAT SITE OKAY THANK YOU WHEN YOU BUY PAST THAT YOU'D KNOW IT. I JUST WANTED IF I MAY LET ME ASSURE HANNAH. GAS THE BAY AREA AN AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT TO A- RESPONDED IN CONTENTION THAT. SOMEHOW CHARTERS AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A RIGOROUS LOCAL REVIEW. I THINK- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THERE'S- WHEN YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND IN THE REQUIREMENTS AND SEE WHAT THERE'S- THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL SEQUEL WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN. SO NORMALLY WHEN YOU DO SEE WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF THE PROJECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IN IN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS THERE IS ALSO A- REQUIREMENT TO LOOK OUTWARD. THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROPOSED SCHOOL SITE INTO MY PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THE SITING THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT. WHERE TO. FIRST QUARTER THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT- IN FOR ARE FOR THAT EMIT TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS YOU KNOW TO ASK THE TSC IF THERE'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OR HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES NEARBY AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS DON'T EXIST IN A TRADITIONAL SEQUEL PROJECT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE BUILDING A- AN APARTMENT COMPLEX OR OR AT THE NEW FACILITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE HEART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS TO GET THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO TAKE THAT OUTWARD LOOK JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WITHIN A QUARTER MILE FOUR THOUSAND FEET OR WHATEVER IT IS. THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THOSE. HI WE- IS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SITES HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES- ERR YOU KNOW TOXIC- EMISSION SITES IN USE THAT IN YOUR DECISION MAKING AND AT LEAST. YOU KNOW GIVE GIVE YOURSELVES AND THE PUBLIC THE- THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO WHEN YOU BUILD THAT SO THAT SITE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE MISTER VICE CHAIR REJECTED. COMMENTS I GUESS NOT TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT WHEN YOU. TAKE A SCHOOL SITE FOR THE STATE I GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL SOLVE ISSUES. AND CHARTER SCHOOL OR PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY GOT TO DO THE STATE ISSUES AND IT'S BEEN MISSION AND THE LOCAL ISSUES THE GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT TIME TO GO THROUGH THERE. IT I DON'T SEE IT APPLES FOR APPLES I SEE IT AS A MORSE RESTRAINTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO THEY DO NOT BUILD. OR EXPAND. AND I THINK THAT'S AN HINDRANCE TO THE PUBLIC THAT NEEDS FILLING. UP MISTER TO. THANK I'M WELL WHAT YOU ARE THAT YOU'RE CLOSE- I'M GOING MAKE COM FOR OF ALL WE HAVE IS OF SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO FIND FACILITIES SO YOU KNOW THERE AREN'T THAT MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS BEING BUILT MOSTLY THEY'RE GOING INTO OLDER- FACILITIES- SECOND. YOU KNOW I DO SEE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH HAVING BOTH THE STATE AND THE LOCAL I ALSO SEE THAT DESPITE WHAT THE WITNESSES SAID THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MISTAKES ARE MADE BY LOCAL. I THE LOCALS BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT NOW- SO I SEE SOME I SEE SOME JUSTICE IN YOUR ARGUMENT AND I'D SUGGEST PERHAPS THE AUTHOR COULD FIND A WAY OF TO HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER AGENCIES BE THE PRIMARY AND MAKE SURE THAT. THESE QUESTIONS OF THE EFFECT OF THE END ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE SCHOOL GET LOOKED AT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S POSSIBLE. AND IT'S UP TO YOU AND YOU CAN ADD TO THAT OR NOT IN YOUR CLOSE. BUT- I'M FINE WITH THE BILL AS IT IS. IF THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN MAKE IT LESS BURDENSOME THAT'S FINE BUT- YOU KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE MISTAKES LIKE WERE MADE WITH THE PRIVATE SCHOOL IN THE BAY AREA OR THE CHARTER SCHOOL AT CARNEGIE. JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THAT OUR KIDS ARE TOO PRECIOUS SO AGAIN. I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THE BILL AS IT IS BUT IF WE CAN. LIGHTEN THE BURDEN SOMEWHAT I'M HAPPY WITH THAT TOO. LONG AS WE GET THAT PROTECTION SO- PLEASE MAKE CLOSE YES I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THE SECOND BILL THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD WORK ON SINCE THIS IS MY LAST YEAR HERE. OKAY IN SESSION AND I DON'T WANNA. CONVOLUTED THINGS I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA ARE YOU BILL IT'S BEEN CHAMPIONED BY MR LEE WHOSE MY AGE I'M NOT A DOCTOR THIS YEAR. AND THE CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE CONTINUE TO MOVE- THE BOOK THOUGH THE FIELD GOAL ON US OR WHAT THEY WANT AND I WILL SAY BEFORE THEY WANTED TO. TURN INSIGHTS TO BE GRANDFATHERED IN THIS BILL DOES THAT AND NOW THEY'VE CHANGED TO A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN WAIVE ALL OF THE LOCAL I. REQUIREMENTS CUT HAY DID EXACTLY THAT. AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL KNEW THAT THAT THAT HAD LED AN ARSENIC AND GETTING CARE AND WE TALK ABOUT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHICH IS WHAT CUT A HATE A 100% IS THOSE KIDS DESERVE TO BE SAFE NO MATTER WHAT IF IT'S BURDENSOME IT'S PART OF SOME FOR A REASON AND THEY DESERVE TO BE SAFE. OUT THERE. I WILL SAY WE HAVE A NEW SCHOOL IN MAY WOULD NEIGHBORING CITY- THAT WAS BUILT ON A- SITE THAT WAS COMPLETE. THE EIGHT EIGHT AND IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY NON TOXIC EFFECTS IN THE WHOLE CITY NOW. OUT THERE ARE AND SO THEY ARE COMPLYING AND WE'RE EXCITED FOR THAT SCHOOL AND SO WE WELCOME YOU SCHOOLS TO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR STUDENTS. OUR STATE AND THE IDEA THAT THERE'S LACK OF FUNDING OR ITS CUMBERSOME TO ME IS IN FULL TEEN ACTUALLY GETS IN THE DAY BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL. TO ENSURE KIDS ARE SAVE THESE TOXICS NOT ONLY MAKE IT SICK BUT ALSO AFFECT OUR ABILITY. GET TO THE OUT THERE AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THIS IS A BILL IN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE NATION. AN INDUSTRY INNOVATION IN EQUITY. AS WE BUILD A SHARED FUTURE. THE JUSTICE FORTY ACT ESTABLISHES AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WITHIN THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL COMPOSED OF STAKEHOLDERS FROM IMPACTED FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES LABOR. TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS TO RECOMMEND PROJECTS. AND KEEP CONSISTENCY WITH THE FEDERAL JUSTICE FORTY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND TRACK THE EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN JOBS THAT. THE FRAMEWORK WE SAID IS THAT 40% OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS GO TO PROJECTS SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WITH AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT. SPECIFICALLY EARMARKED FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE'VE OPERATIONALIZED DISADVANTAGED USING THE CALAVERAS SCREEN AND I KNOW THE CHALLENGE WITH THAT IS THAT OFTEN THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EXTREMELY POOR THAT. HAVE GOOD AIR QUALITY. IN GET LEFT OUT OF THAT ANALYSIS AND TO BE MINDFUL AND THOUGHTFUL OF THAT AND TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO OUR A HOLISTIC CONCEPTUALIZATION OF DISADVANTAGED WE'VE ADDED AN EARMARKED SPECIFICALLY FOR JUST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. IT'S TIME TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE PROCESS IN HARM BY DECADES OF BAD CHOICES. ENDED NEWS USE NEW RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AND HELP. THE RESULT OF THE LACK OF INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN AND SHARP CLEAR. THE COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE ARE LIVING WITH THE LEGACIES OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM. FROM CHOICES FROM DECADES AGO.

TRUCK DRIVERS ROOFTOP ROOFERS AGRICULTURAL LABOURS. INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE WILL PRODUCE. BELOW JOBS FOR EVERYONE.AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN COMMUNITY VOICES COME TO THE TABLE THE RESULTS ARE ALSO BETTER AGAIN. FOR EVERYONE. BUT THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN UNLESS WE ARE CLEAR ABOUT OUR GOALS. AND WHAT THIS TASK FORCE IS LOOKING TO DO IS AGAIN REVIEW AND RECOMMEND PROJECTS. MARK 440% OF THE FEDERAL CLIMATE DOLLARS COMING IN FOR CLEAN ENERGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THOSE FUNDS TO GO TOWARDS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND AN ADDITIONAL 10% DIRECTLY FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND HOUSEHOLD WHILE UPHOLDING SKILLED AND TRAINED LABOR STANDARDS TO GIVE TESTIMONY WITH ME TODAY.

THE FEDERAL JUSTICE FORTY INITIATIVE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP JUSTICE FORTY OF THE FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO DIRECT 40% OF CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WELL THIS IS A STRONG FEDERAL GOAL THAT WE SUPPORT STATES WILL ULTIMATELY DETERMINE MUCH OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THIS IS CARRIED OUT AB TWENTY FOURTEEN IS A CRUCIAL AND NECESSARY BILL TO ENSURE THE EQUITABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JUSTICE FORTY INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND TO ADVANCE THE DECADES LONG FIGHT TO DISMANTLE ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM AND ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES CAN THRIVE AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN WILL COMMIT TO JUSTICE FORTY BY REQUIRING 40% OF FEDERAL CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDS TO BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH AN ADDITIONAL 10% INCOME IT IF UNTIL AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN WILL BE A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY OF HOW STATES DELIVER THE PROMISE OF JUST FORTY.

THANKYOU VERY MUCH- NEXT ON THE PHONE LINE. ACCIONES LEGAL- PLEASE JUST SPEAK UP AND WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU. AFTERNOON CHAIR CORKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEREMY PLEASE GO ON I'M A MANAGING DIRECTOR POLICY LINCOLN NATIONAL RESEARCH AND ACTION INSTITUTE BASED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA HOW WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THE PROJECTS WE FIND THE PLACES THAT STAND. ON THE JOB PATHWAYS WE CREATE IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND PRIORITIES OF THE SOCIETY FOR TOO LONG THE CHOICES WE'VE MADE HAVE CREATED AND REINFORCED SPEAK RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVIDES MEETING MANY L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G COMING&lt;/c&gt; TO ME AND OF COLOR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE MOST BASIC FEATURES OF A HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE NEIGHBORHOOD. TODAY THEY'RE AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS BY WATER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T MEET SAFETY STANDARDS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LIVING COMMUNITIES FOR LAND USE PLANNING INDUSTRIAL CITING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS OVER GENERATIONS OF CONCENTRATED ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER RATES OF ASTHMA HEART DISEASE AND OTHER HEALTH BURDENS. THE CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS HOW TO REPAIR AND REPLACE CRUMBLING ROADS AGING WATER SYSTEMS UPDATED UTILITY SYSTEMS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISMANTLE THE STRUCTURES OF RACISM THAT HAVE DIVIDED US AND BUILD A MORE JUST AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. THE POLICY LIKE WE HAVE A MODEL EQUITY IS THE SUPERIOR GROWTH MODEL THIS MEANS THE EQUITY DRIVEN INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE NEW JOBS AND BOLSTER LONG TERM COMPETITIVENESS FALL AT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT EVERYONE ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BENEFIT FROM IT DELIVERS ON THAT BY EMBEDDING EQUITY INTO OUR INVESTING IN HARD FUND CHECK COMING THAT GREATEST NEED THIS IS SOME AND BUT IT'S ALSO A BETTER TYPE ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH BENEFITS EVERY FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY DO WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS IN THE HEARING ROOM WE WANT TO- TESTIFIED SUPPORT WITH NAME POSITION AND- ORGANIZATION. GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JONES WITH COMMUNITY WATER CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MMHM. REBECCA MARKETS ON BEHALF OF THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT GREAT. I'M NOW WE HAVE MISTER ADAM QUINONEZ IN HERE IN PERSON TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ADAM. ARE YOU STILL HERE IT ACTUALLY ARE THERE YOU ARE ON THE- LINE. YEAH THE MUCH- AARON MEMBERS ADDING KIANA SOME BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES I RESPECTFULLY WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. APPLE REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY PUBLIC NONPROFIT WATER AGENCIES MANY OF THEM- CERTIFIED BANDS COMMUNITIES. WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN WE HAVE ADVOCATED IN THE PAST FOR FUNDING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING SB TWO HUNDRED FROM TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH ESTABLISHED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER BOND. ABOUT FUND PROVIDES A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN IS THE DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WHICH THE AUTHOR TOUCHED ON. IT IT'S A VERY NARROW DEFINITION AND LEAVES OUT MANY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I'M INCLUDING SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFIED AT DISADVANTAGE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER BOND. I'M ALMOST NO CAN NO OF SAC WE BE I DO. AS THE CITY. DESPITE THE FACT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THE POOREST IN THE STATE. SO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED DISADVANTAGED WOULD HAVE TO COMPETE FOR MORE LIMITED RESOURCES- AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IDENTIFIED THE 10% OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THAT USES COUNT BY RESTRAINT DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED WHICH FAILED TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS. CALAVERAS BEING WOULD DEVELOP TO IDENTIFY AIR QUALITY ISSUES AND IT'S REALLY NOT THE RIGHT TOOL TO IDENTIFY WATER QUALITY- CHALLENGES. THE WATER RESOURCES AND STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD USE THAT PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED. WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO DIRECT FUNDING THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE WATER QUALITY ISSUES. IN ADDITION WHILE THIS BILL SEEKS TO BUILD ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S JUSTICE FORTY IN ADDITION TO. THE FEDERAL EFFORT IS THE GOAL ONLY AND THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A MANDATE THAT 40% OF FEDERAL FUNDING BE ALLOCATED. TO A MORE NARROW GROUP OF COMMUNITIES. NOW WILD 40% THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER FOR SOME TYPES OF FUNDING IT MAY NOT BE FOR OTHERS- IN THE FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE STILL IDENTIFYING HOW THIS GOAL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. AND TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS THEY HAVE YET EIGHT DIFFERENT GET DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. SO IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE CALIFORNIA DIRECTING FUNDING TO COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY NOT EVEN PASSED BY THE FEDERAL GOAL. AS WE GET THE HEAD OF THAT PROCESS. SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT THIS BILL ONLINE WITH THE FEDERAL PROCESS WHICH IS ONGOING AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT BE ABOUT SOMEBODY STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO IS SO MUCH TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION. THERE BEING NONE OF WILL THEN ASK FOR AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN BRIAN.

OUR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MISTER VICE CHAIR OR JUST MATHIS MISTER VOTER HISTORY DID A COMMENT PRETTY MUCH FOR THIS BUT CALIFORNIA ALREADY A PRIORITY AT THAT PRIORITIZES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY CURRENTLY 10% OF ALL CAP AND TRADE AUCTION REVENUES. MUST BE SPENT ON PROJECTS LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. 25% ON PROJECT THE BENEFIT THOSE COMMUNITIES. MANY GRANTS ALSO PRIORITIZE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THIS REGARD CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY WAY AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. SO AT THIS TIME I THINK THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY. BOB GO AHEAD. THANK YOU- THANK YOU- MISTER BRYANT FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES- JUST SOME QUESTIONS- TO CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING SO THAT THE POINT WAS MADE THAT. THAT IF THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSES OR DEFINES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT IS THAT GOING TO PRE EMPT- HOW YOUR BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO A THAT IDEA DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. NO IT'S NOT- IT'LL BE IN COLLABORATION IN CONCERT ONE ANOTHER BUT THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES OR AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND LEAVE A LOT OF DISCRETION AN OPPORTUNITY UP TO THE STATES OKAY IN FACT I THINK OUR LEADERSHIP COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THINKS ABOUT WOULD DISADVANTAGE COMMITTEE. OKAY SO- I AM I'M SURE IT YOU YOU EVER A KNOWLEDGE TO THE- YOU'RE YOU'RE DESIRE TO- TO ADDRESS SOME OF AQUA'S CONCERNS ABOUT HOW- THE CALAVERAS GREEN LEAVES OUT A LOT OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THAT OTHERWISE HAVE. I GUESS BETTER AIR QUALITY- I AM SURE IT'S NOT YOUR INTENT TO EXCLUDE THOSE COMMUNITIES WHY WHY NOT JUST TO. WHY NOT JUST TAKE OUT HELP CALLIN BY OR OR OR TAKE OUT CALAVERAS SCREEN OR SUPPLEMENT IT WITH WHAT. YOU KNOW THE WATER YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE DIRECTING TO. FUNDS SUIT TO ADDRESS- GO ALONG COMPANIES WITH UNSAFE DRINKING WATER ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THE CALAVERAS SCREEN DOESN'T JUST USE AIR QUALITY RIGHT IT'S A CONSTELLATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT A LOT OF THESE INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS- OR TO GO TO REMEDY. AND TO MITIGATE RIGHT I WOULD OPERATIONALIZE DISADVANTAGE COP IN A HOLISTIC WAY OF TWO DIFFERENT WAYS- YOU COULD YOU COULD DEFINE IT BY OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE MOST LIQUOR STORES FOR HER NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS EVERYBODY HAS AN INTEREST ON HOW THEY CAN FIND ITS ADVANTAGE POOR AIR QUALITY AND POOR WATER. QUALITY OVERLAP MATURE THIS WAYTHE WAY THAT THEY DON'T IT'S OFTEN- MOST. OF THIS PROXY COVERED BY LOW INCOME WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE WHAT WE'VE USED 40% FOR DISADVANTAGED OPERATIONAL. IN THE CALAVERAS CLINTON SPENT FOR STRICTLY LOW INCOME THOSE IT IS THAT DON'T FIT UNDER THAT LEAVES FIFTH PERCENT THE SIMPLEST DOLLAR THAT COULD GO EITHER OR BOTH. AND ALL. OUR OUR OUR- ARE YOU ONE AQUA DISAGREEING ON WHAT CAN BE SHOULD QUALIFY FOR THESE I DON'T THAT WE ARE. I THINK WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO DIVIDE PIE. WITHOUT APPRECIATING THE FACT THAT IT'S A NEW PART IN THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO CAN AND SHOULD BE HELPED AND- WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY. NOT TO BELABOR THE REFERENCE BUT HAVE NOT HAD. GET A PIECE OF THIS ONE RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE WE DO THIS RIGHT. NOW BUT WE KNOW THE HISTORIC CHALLENGES OR PUSH BACK TO USING KALAN VIRAL SCREEN AS A MEASURE ALBEIT IT'S A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND WELL CRAFTED MEASURE IT DOES LEAVE OUT EXTREMELY POOR. COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE SOME OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND THOSE EXTREMELY POOR COMMUNITIES. ARE THOUGHT OF INCLUDED AND HAVE BEEN IN THIS BILL FROM ITS INCEPTION. FIVE FINALLY- YOU YOU AND I AND OTHERS IN THIS COMMUNITY- THAT- YOU THERE'S THERE BEEN ONGOING ISSUES IN TERMS OF- A LOT OF THE- THE WORST ENVIRONMENTAL HARM COMING FROM- REFINERIES AND OIL DRILLING AND THAT- LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- DO YOU FORESEE THESE DOLLARS. TO SOMEHOW REMEDIATE- THE DALLAS ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS FROM THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF REFINERIES AND OIL DRILLING TAKING PLACE ALONG CAN COMMITTEES A COLOR. I THINK IF THAT'S WHAT THE JUSTICE ORTY TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS- WITH THEIR PROPOSALS I DON'T WANNA JUMP AHEAD OF THE TASK FORCE'S RESPONSIBILITIES BUT I THINK THAT IS. ONE OF THE VISION THE KEY OBLIGATIONS TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS COULD BE REMEDIED. A REPAIRED AND PART OF THE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THAT WE'RE ALL BUILDING- USING THESE DOLLARS OKAY I SUSPECT IT'LL BE PART OF THE CASE WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR- PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR TO THIS BILL. BE HABITAT THANK YOU. YES BOB MISS GARCIA I THINK FIRST AND THEN- THAT. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE- PURPOSE OF THE CALAVERAS SCREENING AND IF COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT BEHIND AT THIS I MEAN THAT THE CALAVERAS SCREENING THIS FAILING- OUT THERE IT'S MEANT TO LOOK AT A NUMBER OF ISSUES SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR HEALTH. OUT TALKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SIDE OF IT ALL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WANT AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE MEASURED OUT THERE IT DOESN'T MEAN COMMUNITIES ARE LONG CONCERNED SERVE RESOURCES A DISPLAY OF CAR THAT THAT 10% GUARANTEED AND THEY'RE STILL 50% OF THE PIE. LEFT OUT THERE AND SO AS WE ARE ARE YOU KNOW RIGHT NEW PLAN HOW TO CUT IT UP I THINK IT'S FAIR FOR GROUPS ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELF ON SPEAK UP AND TRY TO GET AS MUCH AS THEY CAN THAT'S OUR JOB I AND I APPLAUD THAT BUT IT SHOULD BE AT THE EXPENSE OR- MISREPRESENTING A- TOOL THAT WE HAVE HERE AND IN THE CAPITAL AND CAL. SHOULD BE. OKAY. AND OTHER PLACES OTHER SO. I A YEAR AFTER YEAR TO. THIS IT'S- ON THE CALAVERAS SCREENING AND IT'S FASTER- THE COW. WE TO SELL YOUR AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA NINE CALIFORNIA TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE. THANK YOU.

AND THAT CAN CERTAINLY GO TO WATER PROJECTS AS WELL SO I WILL LEAVE THIS IN YOUR HANDS. AND RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE AND- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM FIVE AB. TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN. MACKLOWE AFTER I'VE GOT A CLOSE CLOSE PLEASE. THAT THE I MEAN I APPRECIATE THE URGENCY I THINK THERE IS URGENCY- WHAT WHAT I HAVE BROUGHT TO THIS COMMITTEE IS A BILL THAT BRINGS LABOR TO THE TABLE A BILL THAT BRINGS ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO THE TABLE. A BILL THAT TAKES NEW FEDERAL RESOURCES AND CREATES A- POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING THOSE RESOURCES TO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY HARMED. BY BAD INVESTMENTS AND HARMFUL INVESTMENTS WITHOUT LEAVING OUT- THE POOREST OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATES I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PASS THIS BILL I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD NOW YOU CAN CALL THE ROLL THANK YOU FOR CATCHING ME ON THAT IS PICTURE. WITH CITY OF WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE AUTHOR OF THE A CO AUTHOR. THANKS GREAT. I ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY FOUR NINETEEN BRIAN THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK HI CORK I BET SMITH ARAMBULA ARAMBULA I. KALRA CHOLERA HIGH BENNETT BENNETT I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI MATHIS. MATHIS NOT VOTING WHAT I TO G. MODES TO CHEAT I WALDRON. THREE FIVE SIX TWO WE HAVE VOTE. THANK YOU. SO MR RENDON LAST FOR COMMITTEES AT ONE SEVENTY IS. HE'S GOT TO GO SO NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM MR BLOOM THANK YOU FOR WAITING SO LONG THIS IS I LOVE THIS. IT'S HER FLORAL ALKYL AND POLY FLORAL ALKYL SUBSTANCES P. FAST AND P. FAST PRODUCTS. AND PRODUCT COMPONENTS PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE REPORTING PLATFORM. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT. BUT I GET THAT MUCH LOVE FOR MY BILLS APPRECIATED- AND- GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL OF YOU- AND I'LL BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND TO THIS COMMITTEE STAFF FOR- THEY'RE VERY DILIGENT WORK WITH MY STAFF AND ME ON THIS LEGISLATION CONCERNS ARE MOUNTING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ABOUT THE TOXICITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSISTENCE OF FOSS CHEMICALS THE EUROPEAN UNION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA THE OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN WORK TO CURB. PEOPLE US POLLUTION BY SETTING CONTAMINATION LIMITS AND RESTRICTING THE USE OF PEACE PROCESS AND PRODUCTS. BUT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE EVERYWHERE IN OUR DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER AND EVEN RAIN WATER SEN OUR BODIES AND THE BODIES OF WATER AND FISH UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE AS A SPREADING THROUGH THE THROUGHOUT THE ECOSYSTEM. AND THEY'RE ASKING- FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION WHERE IS IT ALL COMING FROM. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE A MANUFACTURER OF P. FOSS OR A MANUFACTURER OF A PRODUCT OR PRODUCT COMPONENT CONTAINING THE FILES THAT IS SOLD OFFERED FOR SALE DISTRIBUTOR OFF. FOR PROMOTION PURPOSE. INNER BOARD IN EIGHT REPORT THOSE PRODUCTS AND THE AMOUNT OF P. FONTS THAT CONTAIN TO A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE ANNUALLY. THE BILL FURTHER INSTRUCTS THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL TO WORK WITH THE INTERSTATE CHEMICALS CLEARING HOUSE TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN THAT DATABASE PLATFORM. P. FIVE OUR CLASS OF APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND TOXIC MAN MADE CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE FOUND IN MANY PRODUCTS PRODUCTS SUCH AS NONSTICK COOKWARE WATER REPELLENT CLOSE. THE CHURCH. HOUSE PRODUCTS PAUL MERRY OUT OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS EXPOSURE TO P. FIVE SUSPEND WITH A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CONCERNS THE- ANSWER READ THE- HI. AND REDUCED IMMUNE RESPONSE AND VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS. VIRTUALLY ALL PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE P. FONTS IN THEIR BODIES AND BABIES ARE BEING BORN WITH THEM MANY PRODUCTS AND EVEN AN INDUSTRIAL SUBSTANCES BUT BECAUSE P. FOSS HAS SO MANY USES AND IS ONLY MET. FOR ALL. COULD A FOR ANY SECTOR INDUSTRY. WE THAT THE P. FOSS USES WE HAVE ONLY STARTED TO REGULATE- SUCH AS- USES IN FOOD PACKAGING CARPETS TEXTILES COSMETICS AND FIREFIGHTING FOAM ARE ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. IN ORDER FOR READERS THAT CAN MAKERS TO UNDERSTAND BUT A MATCH THIS P. FAST POLLUTION WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW INTEREST BUYER. EIGHTEEN COMES FROM. EIGHT TWO FORTY SO WILL BE US THIS PER BY REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO REPORT TO THE INTERSTATE CHEMICAL CLEARING HOUSE WHICH IS A NATIONAL DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY A MEMBER OF. IMPORT ATTAINING PEAK BOSS THIS INFORMATION IS NOT ONLY NEEDED BY WASTE WATER REGULATORS WHO ARE HERE WITH ME TODAY BUT ALSO DECISION MAKERS AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. I'D LIKE TO BE CLEAR. FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW AND HOW MUCH PEOPLE OWE US IS ENTERING OUR STATE WE CAN'T TAKE FURTHER ACTION UNTIL WE HAVE THAT BASIC INFORMATION. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN WILL HELP US ACCURATELY IDENTIFY HOW MUCH BOXES COMING TO THE STATE. GIVING THE STATE THE AUTHORITY THE STATE WILL ENABLE US TO EXPLORE HOW BEST TO MITIGATE ITS HARMFUL IMPACTS WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE CAN'T TAKE ANY MEANINGFUL STEP TOWARDS PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF CASH POIGNANCY AND ARE ARMED. LONG TERM HERE WITH ME TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL R. ANDREW VENTURA OF CLEAN WATER ACTION AND JESSICA GALLAGHER OF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SANITATION AGENCIES. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST I BELIEVE I WILL OKAY. MANRICO I WON THAT I WON THE LOTTERY- THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S AN HONOR HERE BEFORE YOU AGAIN AND- ALWAYS SITTING NEXT TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM- CLEAN ACTION ALONG WITH THE ENVIRONMENT CAN GROUP AND THE CALIFORNIA. SANITATION AGENCIES- CIRCLE ANSWERING THIS BILL WILL REPEAT THE HEALTH IMPACTS YOU'VE HEARD THEM BEFORE REMIND YOU THAT REGARD OF THE SO CALLED TYPE OF P. FAST ALL OF THESE CHEMICALS PERSIST TRAVEL BROADLY IN. AND THEIR- CAN NO LONGER. OF THIS. IF YOU GET PROGRESS IRAQ IN SOME OF THEM WERE AND UNDERSTOOD USE A P. FAST- OVER THE YEAR BUT AS YOU JUST HEARD ARE WE JUST THE CHIP ICEBERG BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ARE OR HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE HE IS A PROFESSOR HAVE BEEN WELL PUBLIC BUYS. THE BY IN IT NO. BE JUST MAKER SUCH AS- ARE. PUBLIC AGENCIES OR EVEN BUSINESSES HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF HOW THESE CHEMICALS ARE BEING USED THROUGHOUT THE CALIFORNIA MARKET ACTUALLY CAME ABOUT IN THE COURSE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN UNUSUAL COALITION CAME TOGETHER UP FOLKS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH- COMMUNITIES- AS WELL AS THE WASTE WATER COMMUNITY WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GOING TO TRUST EACH OTHER AT A FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT P. FAST AND TRY TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND SOLUTIONS AND THE COURSE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT MAKE PEACE US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO FUTURE SOLUTIONS. IS ABOUT HOW AND IN WHAT FORM CHEMICALS ENTER OUR STATE AND THIS BILL ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BELIEVES LEADERSHIP IS THE RESULT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. SO AND IT WOULD JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION FOR CALIFORNIA IS. HOW DO WE WANT TO RESTRICT MAX. HOW DO WE DECIDE WHAT'S AN ESSENTIAL. FACT THAT WE NEED TO KEEP BUT THINGS WE DON'T NEED HOW TO TAKE ACTION TO MANAGE THAT WAVE SURE I DON'T KNOW ALRIGHT ARE MEANT. TO WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRST LEADERSHIP WE ARE. THE FOR THE AND WE WILL MAKE DECISIONS BASED THE DATA AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HE PRETTY IN THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE WE ARE HERE TODAY AT THE PRESS COSTA OF AB TWENTY TWO FORTY. AS YOU KNOW FOSS HAS BECOME A VERY SIGNIFICANT TOPIC IN WATER AND WASTEWATER IN THE UBIQUITY OF THESE CHEMICALS COUPLED WITH THE URGENCY FOR FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING THEM. HAS COME. IN K. ACTIVE MANAGE OPTIONS WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE WATER BOARDS TO IDENTIFY THE LEVELS OF P. FAST IN OUR SYSTEM THROUGH A STATEWIDE MONITORING AND REPORTING ORDER- PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE FIRST PHASE OF THIS EFFORT INDICATE THAT WE'RE SEEING CONSISTENT LEVELS OF P. FUSSING WASTE WATER FROM BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHARGES IT'S COMING IN FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THOSE THAT WE CAN CURRENT REGULATE THROUGH- THE INDUSTRIAL PERMITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT INDICATES IT IS BEING USED IN PRADA. PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES. WE SEE CONSISTENTLY THAT ARE MORE P. FIVE COMPOUNDS IN EFFLUENTS COMPARED TO THE INFLUENCE. INDICATING THAT SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS HAVE A TENDENCY TO TRANSFORM INTO MORE HARMFUL COMPOUNDS DURING THE CONTROLLED TREATMENT PROCESS. AND THIS TENDENCY IS REPRESENTATIVE OF HOW THESE PERSISTENT COMPOUNDS REACT IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AS AGENCIES TASKED WITH THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT THIS IS A VERY DAUNTING PROCESS TO BE FACE. THERE'S NO CABLE DESTRUCTION TECHNOLOGY SO TREAT. A SIGNIFICANT RATEPAYER EXPENSE WOULD ONLY DISPLACE THE CHEMICAL RESIDUALS TO A DIFFERENT WEIGHT DREAM. SO THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS SOURCE CONTROL SOURCE REDUCTION AND POLLUTION PREVENTION. RIGHT NOW WE ARE LIMITED BY THE LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE CHEMICALS ARE USED IN COMMERCE AND UNTIL WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM WE CAN'T IMPLEMENT MEANINGFUL SOURCE REDUCTION POLICIES. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD GIVE US THE DATA WE NEED TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND FOR US TO BETTER IDENTIFY TO THE PEOPLE OFTEN OUR WATERSHEDS. WE WOULD USE THIS INFORMATION TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS ON POLLUTION PREVENTION POLICIES TO LIMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF THESE CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN WILL GIVE US THE AND- REPORT THAT. I WANT. NUMBER YOUR I. SO ARE THERE ARE IN ROOM INTO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS THERE DAHLE FIELD HAPPILY CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON UNDER AVERAGE OUT WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JOHNSON COMMUNITY WATER CENTER IN SUPPORT.

SUTTER CORTES AT KELLER- CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT GREAT THANK YOU. WE'VE GOT QUITE A LIST TO SUPPORTERS- TAMPINES COME FORWARD. SO TOO I'M SURE STEP IS WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL AND HE'S HERE TO SPEAK FOR THEIR POSITION ON THE BILL. THANK YOU DR COURT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE FOR THE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY I DO WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE GOT A COUPLE OF MEETINGS WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPENNESS AND- OPEN DIALOGUE- WE DO UNDERSTAND APPRECIATE INTENDED THE BILL BUT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A FEW CONCERNS. AND AS OF TODAY MUST RESPECT TAKEN IN OPPOSE POSITION. AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A NEW DATABASE TO HOUSE INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY MANUFACTURERS. ARE INDUSTRY CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE REASONABLE PRODUCTION USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THESE FLORIDA SUBSTANCES. BUT WITH RESPECT TO TWENTY TO FORTY SEVEN WE HAVE RAISED A COUPLE OF CONCERNS- THIS BILL COMES AT A TIME WHEN U. S. EPA IS. EXPECTED TO FINALIZE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING RULE ON THIS VERY SAME ISSUE LATER THIS YEAR- MANUFACTURES A P. FOSS AND PEOPLE TALK. CONTAINING ARTICLES- MUST REPORT IN. ELEVEN OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION PROPOSED A USES FOR EACH SUBSTANCE OR MIXTURE DESCRIPTIONS OF BY PRODUCTS RESULTING FROM MANUFACTURING PROCESSING USE AND DISPOSAL- INFORMATION RELATIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL- AND HEALTH EFFECTS AS WELL AS WORKER EXPOSURE TO NAME A FEW. EPA HAS STATED THAT THIS RULE IS TO HELP THEM BETTER UNDERSTAND SOURCES AND QUANTITIES OF P. FAST MANUFACTURING IN THE US SUPPORT ON GOING RESEARCH MONITORING AND REGULATORY EFFORTS. WE THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO LEVERAGE THIS INFORMATION BETTER UNDERSTAND A POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXPOSURE AND ALLOW DGSE OR ANOTHER APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY TO PRIORITIZE A POTENTIAL FUTURE REGULATORY ACTIONS- WE DO BELIEVE THAT DGSE DOES HAVE SOME EXISTING AUTHORITY TO COMPEL MANUFACTURE ASK MANUFACTURERS FOR. FOR INFORMATION- AND IT'S A COMMITTEE MAY KNOW THE- CENTER ALLEN'S SB FIVE OH TWO IS MOVING TO A LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD COMPEL MANUFACTURERS AT THE TNCS DIRECTION TO PROVIDE A HOST OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS CONCENTRATION FUNCTIONAL USE. INFORMATION IS RELATIVE TO THE USE OF PRODUCTS. IT WHEN ANOTHER. RELATIONS ARE SO AGAIN WE DO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT IN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE SOME OF OUR EXISTING TOOLS ONGOING TOOLS AT EPA- TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND- INSTILL SOME OF THE DATA GAPS THAT CALIFORNIA MAY IDENTIFY AS A PRIORITY JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES REAL QUICKLY RIGHT NOW THE BILL DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ARGUE A TO MINIMUS LEVEL THAT WOULD TRIGGER REPORTING OBLIGATIONS SO SUPPLY CHAINS ARE PRETTY COMPLEX SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE COMPANIES ALL PER COMPONENT PARTS THAT COULD IS IN A SINGLE PROP- OF A STATE SPECIFIC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS COULD BE. TREMENDOUSLY COMPLICATED- AND AGAIN AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN DOT. A THIRD. EITHER OUR STATE CHEMICALS- HOUSE TO CREATE AND MANAGE THIS INFORMATION. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AT LEAST SOME GUIDELINES OR REQUIREMENTS THAT ENSURE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED- IT'S PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC IN A IN A SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND MANNER. BEING SKINNY PER PRESENTING SUCH TECHNICAL AND YOU WANT INFORMATION. IS IMPORTANT FOR MANUFACTURERS TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS IN OUR VIEW AND THERE SHOULD BE A FORMAL PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURERS DOING H. WITH- THE INTERSTATE CHEMICAL CLEARING HOUSE IF THERE IS AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF HOW THAT INFORMATION. IS PRESENTED AND IT FINALLY GIVEN THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS THAT WOULD FIT FALL ON POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS. OF A JULY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR COMPLIANCE. IN ARE NOT NECESSARILY BE ACHIEVABLE SO I WITH THESE UP THE KEY CONCERNS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE BUT AGAIN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR AND- IS IT SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD WE WOULD BE CONSTRUCTING ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION SO APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY.

CATEGORY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE- ONLY IT WORKS THE END INDUSTRY UP SECTORS TO SEE HOW WE CAN BEST IDENTIFY UNINTENTIONAL P. FAST. WITHOUT CHASING EVERY MOLECULE IN THE WORLD THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE BUT WE DON'T AT THIS POINT WANT TO LOSE THE INFORMATION OF WHAT MAY BE COMING IN STATE IN FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS DUE TO CONTAMINATION SO WE ARE WILLING. DO TO COPY THE RECESSION ON THAT FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY FORWARD ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER OF HOW TO BEST.

ARAMBULA I WALDRON. SIX VERY GOOD SO MR GARCIA DO YOU WANT TO START WITH AB TWENTY FORTY ONE- CALIFORNIA SAFE WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT. PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARDS YES SERVICE CHAIRED COLLEAGUES AND I'LL JUST JUMP RIGHT IN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS. WHEN A PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARD IS ADOPTED. AND THAT REALLY LOOKING AT HOW WE GET INTO COMPLIANCE I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE AS IT RELATES TO CONTAMINANTS IN OUR WATER. BUT THERE A LOT OF IN NEED TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF ABILITY ACCESSIBILITY TO TECHNOLOGIES AND- ULTIMATELY WHICH SYSTEM STOCKS THAT CALIFORNIA ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO COMPLY- WHEN ADOPTED AND IF NOT WHO ARE THEY WHERE ARE THEY AND WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET THEM. TO COMPLIANCE SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT- ARE A WITNESS TODAY'S AMOUNT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY JAILS. THANK YOU BUTTERMILK VICE CHAIR SMITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AND I DON'T THEY GOT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I HAVE SERVED AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES WITH R. FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS WERE CONSIDERED. THE VOICE A SMALL SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA FOR BEING A CITY SUPPORTER OF SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE PASSWORD THE CHAIRMAN DID ON PRIMACY AGENCIES AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE AGENCIES IT SERVES. MS ARE PROPERLY FUNDED. I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER THERE EXCELLENT SUGGESTIONS AND CONSTRUCTIVE AMENDMENTS. ABOUT AB TWENTY FORTY ONE. WE FEEL THAT THE SIX AREAS IDENTIFIED FOR CONTINUING WORK ON THIS BILL ARE ACHIEVABLE BECAUSE THE CLARIFICATIONS ARE BASED ON THE CURRENT PRACTICES AND RESOURCES. OF THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING NEW SAFE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS FOR TARGETED CHEMICALS. AS WELL AS IN THE BOARD'S CURRENT WORK TO HELP WATER SYSTEMS AT RISK OF FAILURE UNDER THE SAFER PROGRAM. UNDER CURRENT PRACTICES IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SAFE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS COMPLIANCE BY SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS PRETTY MUCH. THE CHATS. BUT THE BILL BLOCK- TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY WERE LARGER SYSTEMS CAN AFFORD TO COMPLY BUT MANY SMALL WATER SYSTEMS CAN. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THE BOARD IS ALLOWING FOR A MULTI YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD FOR EXAMPLE. PROCESS TO SET A NEW STANDARD FOR CHROMIUM SIX. AS THE ANALYSIS NOTED. THE PREVIOUS FOR CHROMIUM SIX SAID BEEN IN THE DAY. TWENTY SEVEN. HUNDRED IT RISK COMPLIANCE WITH PRIMARY DRINKING WATER IN CAL. AB TWENTY FORTY ONE TAKES THE CHANCE OUT OF COMPLIANCE BY ESTABLISHING LOGICAL STEPS AT THE END OF THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE SMALLER AND POOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT CANNOT AFFORD TO COMPLY THE FINAL STEP IS A FINANCIAL PLAN TO HELP THEM COMPLY AB TWENTY FORTY ONE WILL ALSO HELP THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER AGAINST FUTURE LEGAL ATTEMPTS TO INVALIDATE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS BECAUSE IT BAKES AND ECONOMIC FEASIBLE. REQUIRING A FINANCE FOR WHAT SINCE COMPLY WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS WE ASK FOR YOUR YES VOTE AND THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR CONSIDERING THIS BILL IN THE AUDIENCE IN SUPPORT. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF RESCUE AND SALAS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF COACHELLA DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY THAT WAS FACING A ONE HUNDRED AD 20% INCREASE IN ITS WATERY ONE VALIDATED MCL FOR CHROMIUM WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE ENERGY TO SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE AN EXTENDED STATEMENT TOUR I'M I JUST WANNA SAY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY HERE IN OPPOSITION- EVERY VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL WE THINK THEY BRING UP SOME IMPORTANT POINTS THAT WE DO WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO WE'RE NOT SEEN THAT IN THE BILL AT THIS POINT WE DO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS BUT WE ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS MOVING FORWARD YES. VERY GOOD ENCOURAGES THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER JUST ALIGNING OUR COMMENTS WITH ANDREA THANKS ALL RIGHT SO THE BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND YOU'RE WORKING ON IT AND I TRUST YOU SO THAT'S GOOD- I KNOW YOU TRUST ME TO- LET'S SEE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION WE CAN GO TO THE PHONE LINES.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- MARCH MORE OF A COMMENT MR GARCIA I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING- WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WOULD LOVE TO A CO AUTHOR JOIN IF YOU HAD ME AT THAT LEVEL- THIS IS VERY MUCH NEEDED. AND IT'S ABOUT TIME WE PUT. THE SOME STUFF WHEN INSTALLING WITH CLEAN WATER. MISTER VICE CHAIR SAID THINK THANK YOU- EDUARDO GARCIA ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE I'M HOPING THAT WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR GOVERNOR GET SOME MONEY INTO THIS SO WE DON'T JUST START CONSOLIDATING WATER DESTRUCTION WILL LEAD THE SMALL. BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ON BECAUSE THEY DO A VERY GOOD PART IN THIS AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. HI GOOD. OF THIS GARCIA MISTER CALDERON. NO QUESTIONS VERY GOOD- I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT- THAT YOU CAN ENTER YOUR CLOTHES SO WHAT WHAT THE WATERBOARDING CLEAN WATER ACTION WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS HELLO UNDERSTAND YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION I MEAN I GET MY WATER FROM OUR WATER AGENCY THAT HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. AND IT CAN PRETTY MUCH TAKE CARE OF ANYTHING. BUT THERE CLEARLY ARE AGENCIES THAT CAN'T AND WHAT THEY'LL WANT IN YOUR BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT EVENTUALLY- WE DO GET THE- ARE. WE DO GET THE COMPLIANCE. AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK THIS- TO GET THAT MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED- I THINK THEY'RE STILL WILL BE CONSOLIDATIONS OF SYSTEMS ARE WE'LL SEE HOW THAT ALL WORKS OUT BUT- THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN CLEAN WATER AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A PRICE. THAT PEOPLE CAN'T PAY AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT WHICH IS WHILE BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I THINK YOU YOU STATED IT WELL RIGHT THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WERE NOT COMPROMISING HERE. ONE IS THE HUMAN RIGHT TO YOU KNOW CLEAN SKIN AND AFFORDABLE WATER. AND THE OTHER IS COMPLIANCE RIGHT THOSE ARE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH. WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO BE DONE HERE IS IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO COMPLIANCE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. THAT WILL HAVE A BIGGER CHALLENGES TO GET TO COMPLAINTS IDENTIFYING THEM AS IT'S CRITICAL. AND WHAT THE PATH TO COMPLIANCE LOOKS LIKE IS THAT MUCH MORE. THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SHARE WITH THIS LEGISLATION- WE CANNOT HAVE. A SITUATION WHERE. WE'RE PUTTING- THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS. ON THE CONVERSATION OF PROTECTING PEOPLE- WITH THAT PROVIDING CLEAN DRINKING WATER RIGHT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT. WATER INCREASED TO GET INTO COMPLIANCE- WHERE REALLY- HURTING PEOPLE AT THAT POINT IF FIVE IF NOT THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECT. TO THE FINANCIAL RIGHT AND- THAT'S JUST NOT. ACCEPTABLE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO. IS MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL. PLANTS IN THAT EVERY ONE AT SAFELY DRINKING WATER THAT'S AFFORDABLE SPECTACLE. WELL GREAT BILL. CAN WE HAVE A MOTION. MISTER MATHIS AND- RESENTMENTS GARCIA YES ALL RIGHT- WHEN YOU'RE READY MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL.

AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE THIS BIRD AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR AND HELP ANY WAY I CAN WITH THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD- I'LL JUST MAKE A COMMENT HERE ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES HAS BEEN THE WATER BOARD INSISTING THAT THEY TRIED TO GIVE UP ON THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. I DON'T SEE A NECESSITY FOR THAT. AND I HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL CONVINCE THE WATER BOARD TO TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT. CAN ASSURE- THAT THEY'RE GETTING THEIR- THEY ARE PROJECTS THAT THEIR FUNDING AND AT THE SAME TIME LET TRIBES CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE. SO GIVEN THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU RICHARD YOU KNOW THE TRIBES- ARE STRUGGLING WITH- THE ISSUE OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY WAY READING FOR A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER STATE- FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF. A SAID BEING ABLE TO THIS IS A FRAMEWORK AND APPLY IT TO OTHER CODES IN STATE LAW THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO ALSO INTEGRATE YOU KNOW THEIR EFFORTS WETHERBY TRANSPORTATION- BROADBAND IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLEAN WATER AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO.

GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY FOR IT EVEY TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN REGARDING MICROPLASTICS. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER TEMPORARY CHAIR. AND AND MY FELLOW MEMBERS- AS THE AS WITH ALL BILLS WILL WE START BY SAYING HOW HOW IMPORTANT- COMMITTEE STAFF IS. THAT THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CAN. GET THIS ON THE RIGHT TRACK THEY WORK ON THESE ISSUES THEY CAN TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT. AND THEY CAN THE- KEEP US ON TRACK RIGHT A GOOD ANALYSIS. OF REALLY GOING TO GET US TO REALLY UNDERSTAND OUR BILLS. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD BAN THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF COSMETICS. THE CHURCH AND CERTAIN CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN INTENTIONALLY ADDED MICROPLASTICS. NOW MICROPLASTICS ARE AS PERSISTENT AS YOU COULD GET IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THERE ARE A PERVASIVE PROBLEM YOU JUST HEARD THAT FROM- THAT P. FAST- YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH PLASTICS. ARE THERE EVERYWHERE AND OF COURSE YOU ALSO HEARD THAT FROM- OUR BAIL ON- WASHING MACHINE FILTERS. SO THE IN PARTICULAR THERE S A GREAT STUDY DONE BY THE ESTUARY INSTITUTE SHOWING HOW THEIR FIBERS EVERYWHERE ARE PARTICULARLY- IT GETS INTO THE BAY THROUGH STORMWATER. A LAKE TAHOE ALSO HAS MY AGE WHAT IS A PURE PLACE THE TAHOE. MICROPLASTICS EVERYWHERE STEADIES YOU SHOWN THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE HARMFUL TO MARINE LIFE. AND EXPERTS HAVE RAISED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO OTHER WILDLIFE AND HUMAN HEALTH. ANDIN FACT YOU CAN FIND IT IN PEOPLE'S LUNGS. ONCE MICROPLASTICS A RELEASE IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF COURSE THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN THEY- CAN COULD BECOME SMALLER AND SMALLER TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM. BUT THE SMALLER THEY GET TO A CERTAIN SIZE THEY CAN BE VERY HARMFUL. OF REPORTS BY THE OCEANSIDE AND TRUSTS AND OTHERS RECOMMEND USING A PREVENTIVE APPROACH TO CONTROL SOURCES OF MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO CURB MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION. COLLUDING AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE FIFTEEN IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS I CHAIRED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE SHOULD BAN THE SALE OF RENTS OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN MICROBEADS WHICH ARE MICROPLASTICS THAT ARE USED TO SCRUBBING AGENTS. EVER MICROPLASTICS ARE STILL WIDELY USED IN MANY OTHER CONSUMER GOODS INCLUDING COSMETICS. LAUNDRY DETERGENTS AND CLEANING PRODUCTS CONTINUED NONESSENTIAL USES OF MICROPLASTIC. IN THESE PRODUCTS MIGHT REPORT RELEASED CALIFORNIA'S WATER AIR AND SOIL. FEBRUARY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL RECOMMEND THAT CALIFORNIA RESTRICT THE USE OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED MICROPLASTICS IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS LIKE MAD. S. AS PART OF A STATE WIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY. THIS BILL DIRECTLY ACTS ON THAT RECOMMENDATION TO PROHIBIT THE SALE OF COSMETICS DETERGENTS. AND CERTAIN CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN INTENTIONALLY ADDED MICROPLASTICS TO PREVENT FURTHER MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION. DITERPENE UNION HAS PROPOSED REGULATIONS TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF MICRO PLASTICS IN THESE PRODUCTS. I INTEND TO HAVE A BILL THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN COMPLY WITH MY HOPE IS TO ALIGN CALIFORNIA LAW WITH YOU AGAIN LATER. THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN A MANNER THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THIS. WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS. PRECIADO TACKLE PREVENTED IT WORK WITH US. AS WELL AS ACADEMIA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE E. REGULATION. THE MEN COULD FOR MY STAFF OF HAD WITH STAKEHOLDERS UP TO THIS POINT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM FURTHER- ANY HELP THEY CAN THIS IS. A LIVE. PHYLLIS IS. KIRBY MICHAEL POLLUTION THAT IS ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE. WITH ME TODAY IS PROFESSOR SUSANNE BRANDER FROM THE OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY AND CODY PHILLIPS FROM THE CALIFORNIA. POST KEEPERS A LOT.

NOW THAT YOU'RE VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE HARM OF MY AND HOW UBIQUITOUS THEY ON THE ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING THE DETAILS- JUST- YOU WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT HOW IT ALL FLOW INTO OUR WATER THE PLASTIC WHAT. THE HELL AND WATER. MICROSCOPIC THE DEATH THEY'RE SO SMALL THAT THEY CAN WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH MOSTLY MARC WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES CONTAMINATING OUR DOWNSTREAM SUPPLY. FOR THE TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT CANCELS OUT THESE MICROPLASTICS THOUGH TO PUT IN JUST KEEP AT FIVE. I THERE. ENVIRONMENT TO THE SIDE AND- AFTER THAT THE BY THE BATHROOM FOR CONTROLLING THEM IS MANAGING AT THE SOURCE. SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES- AND FOR THAT REASON THE REASON OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL STRATEGIC REPORT ON. SIX REMANDED RECOMMENDED EXPANDING A P. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT. THE PEACE PROCESS. SIGN THIS WOULD A GREAT SOURCE CAN MICHAEL AND FOR THESE REASONS I YOUR AYE THOUGH ON B. TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN THANK YOU. YOU FOR POTTERY OF. BRAND HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WONDERFUL I'M SO TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID MICROPLASTICS ARE OF. AND DUE TO THE TEMPERATURE SENSORS AND THEIR PROPENSITY TO DEGRADE INTO SMALLER AND SMALLER SMALLER PIECES OF VOLUNTARY LACK OF BIODEGRADE ABILITIES EARLY EVERY ONE FAVORITE DOWN INTO MY CRIB UNDER ABOUT TEN MICRONS IN SIZE CAN TRANSLOCATE AND THE BODY AND THAT AND APOSS TEXTS WHICH WINDOW- EXISTENCE ONE DAY BANK THAT THEY CAN'T BE. BUT CAN I- AND YOURSELF SHE AND WHERE PEOPLE GET DIRECTLY IN WATER- AND OF COURSE THE CAN OFFSET A FACTOR CRITICAL THANK FROM THE CHEMICAL THE TALK TODAY. I ALBUM MANY THEM ARE AND- COME. INTERFERE WITH FORMER FUNCTION SH- SO MANY OBJECTIVE- EVERYTHING RECENTLY COMPLETED STATEWIDE MICROPLASTICS STRATEGY WHICH I WAS- ALL TO CHECK. SENATE BILL SIX THREE ISRAEL THE COMPLETION ATTENTION BY CO AND AFTER IT FROM STRICTER SENSE NEITHER MICROPLASTICS IN ANAPLASTIC CAN BE EASILY REMOVED WHEN THEY ANSWER THE ENVIRONMENT OR ONE INSURE THANKS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF MAN PLASTIC ENTERING WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT AND THEN AND OUR CHANGE ON AN X.

RIGHT I COULD SEE TO ZURCHER MEMBERS MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL- HERE IN REGRETFUL OPPOSITION- OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN A BILL THAT- PUT RIGHT MICHAEL PLUS CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AFTER WOULD HAVE. BEEN BECAUSE MEDIC AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS TODAY LET ME START OFF BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION IS A PROBLEM THAT WILL REQUIRE CREATE STILL. A STRONG TWELVE SEVENTY SEVEN OVER THE BROAD FAILS TO CONSIDER MANY OF THE RECENTLY DEVELOP INNOVATION THEN ARE A THREE. TO ADDRESS THE MATT. THE TWENTY. POST BY MICHAEL STRATEGIES IDENTIFIED MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO MICROPLASTICS- THOSE CATEGORIES INCLUDED VEHICLE TIRES TEXTILES SINGLE USE FOOD WHERE AND PACKAGING AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE ADDITIONALLY AN E.U. MICROPLASTICS DAYS FOUND THAT EXTRAVERTED SEVEN EIGHTY AN AIMLESS X. DIFFERENCE AND HIS. THEN PERCENT MORE SPECIFIC POINT NINE PER CENT TO MARK PROBLEM GLOBALLY. NOT ONLY IS IT PERPLEXING THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHAT THE MINIMUS CONTRIBUTOR SIX BUT DEPENDING ON HOW THE TERM MICROPLASTICS IS ULTIMATELY DEFINED THE BILL COULD DECIMATE AN ENTIRE. TRIP A BANNING ANY OF THE PRODUCTS THAT CONSUMERS FIND ESSENTIAL TODAY. ALMOST NO ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT MICROPLASTICS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN OCEANS THIS BILL FAILS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON AND DOUBLE SORTS RATHER THEM AMERISOURCEBERGEN OF ABOUT. REMEMBER THE SIX R. PALMER NOT ALL POLYMERS PLASTICS MANY OF THE POLYMERS THAT OUR INDUSTRY USES AIR LIQUIDE IN WAX FORM NOT SOLID PARTICLE SECTOR TO PLASTIC IN LETTER. AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE POLYMER WHAT. SHERD IN UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IF THEY ARE THEN THIS BILL WOULD REPRESENT A DEFECTIVE BAND BECAUSE IT IS NOT THAT IS NOT A VIABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR ME OF NON STICK POTS THAT WE USED TO. BE GREAT PRODUCT PROOF ONE STATE ETCETERA AND MANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES THAT CONSUMERS FIND USEFUL AND BANNING THESE POLYMERS WOOD NESSUS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY REQUIRE US. TO REFORMULATE THE END PRODUCT WHICH- WILL TAKE SEVERAL DECADES TO DO. THE OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE IT WAS STILL WORKING ON THEIR DRAFT REGULATIONS WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF A COMMITTEE REPORT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE U.

AND THAT IS- OKAY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN SHOULD EXAMPLE ON COSMETICS- WHICH ARE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE WASHED DOWN THE DRAIN. THINK OF YOUR MASK YOUR LIPSTICK HERE QUESTION THESE PRODUCTS- IN MANY CASES REQUIRE THE CONSUMER TO WIPE THEM OFF WITH THAT. BACKED WE CONSUME AND THAT SHE OVERNIGHT PERCENT SIMMERS UTILIZE MAKE WIPES- TO REMOVE THESE TYPES OF MAKEUP AND THEY'RE SOLID WASTED RATHER THAN BEING FLUSHED DOWN THE- AGAIN MY COLLEAGUES.

IT'S HARMFUL REPLACEMENT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT BASIC PROTECTIONS LIKE WATER FILTERS AND WATER TESTING FEDERAL MONEY TO FUND FULL LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACT BUT WITHOUT AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE STATE COULD STOP ON THE GIARDIA DOT FUNDING. IN ABOUT NINETY THIRTY ONE CALIFORNIANS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON. EXPOSE THAT IN THERE RANKING WATER. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK THIS CAN TO A THAT PARTIAL. ARE STOCKED FULL REPLACEMENTS ARE FUNDED AND IMPLEMENTED AND THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL FIREMAN AND WITHOUT IT OVER TO DOCTOR OLSON THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THREE OAKLAND I AM OF THEM AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. MY LABORATORY HAS CONDUCTED BUT MONITORING FOR DRINKING WATER INCLUDING DURING THE PLAN WATER CRISIS. I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE. OTHER BIT SPECIAL REPLACEMENT OF LEAD CONTAINING SERVICE BONDS IN CALIFORNIA LEAD PIPES ARE MOST OFTEN FOUND AS LEAD GOOSE NECK AS THEY'RE CALLED EITHER SHORT CONNECTOR SEGMENT BETWEEN THE WHITE MAINS AND SERVICE LINES ONE ORIGINALLY CALLED HERE LET WITH HAND AT THE MATERIAL LET QUITE BEND THE ONE CLIMBERS SHAPE IT EASILY. AND A GOOSE NECK AS ONE FREE WATER PASSES FROM THE ME THROUGH THE LEAD GOOSE NECK THOUGH THE WATER AND FOR TOOK UP LET AND ONE THIRTEEN FINE MATURE LIKE GOVERNOR IRON ARE PER. SCREEN ON THE GOVERNOR I THANK. SEVEN I DARN OF PROBLEMATIC AS THE LEAD SOURCE FOR TO. FIRST THE THINK CODING ON NEWER GALVANIZED PIPE CAN CONTAIN UP 22% LEAD AND HENCE IT CAN BE A FORCE OF LET ITSELF SECONDLY AFTER THE THINK CODING CORRODES THE UNDERLYING IRON ROCK. AND THOSE LAYERS. VERY GOOD. LED FROM THE GOOD FOR THIS GALVANIZED IRON IS KNOWN IN AS THE DRINKING WATER PLUMBING MATERIAL. MY HOME STATE OF MICHIGAN REQUIRES THE GALVANIZED IRON SERVICE LINE BE REPLAYED AS PART OF IT READ LATE BY SMALLER COP. FOR MANY COMMUNITY WITH GO A HISTORY OF CORROSION PROBLEM. UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN WATER QUALITY CAN CAUSE CORROSION ISSUES. THE CITY OF FRESNO CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH INTRODUCED SURFACE WATER SOURCES IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SUDDENLY EXPERIENCE CORROSION OF MANY OF THE GALVANIZED SERVICE LINE. LEADING GUY FIVE PIPE IN THE GROUND AFTER. REPLACING THE LEAD GOOD SNACKS WITH THE LOOMING POTENTIAL LEAD EXPOSURE THREAT FOR UNSUSPECTING COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEM. REQUIRING THE REMOVAL OF DOWNSTREAM GALVANIZED SERVICE LINE AT THE TIME THE DISCONNECT IS REMOVED ENSURES THAT THE THREAT IS ELIMINATED. ALL OF THE IS ALSO COST EFFICIENT AND COMING BACK MUCH LATER TO REPLACE GALVANIZED PIPES MEAN TEARING UP THE STREET PAVEMENT YET A SECOND TIME. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF SO DO WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS IN SUPPORT AND WAS ALSO ASKED TO VOICE SUPPORT FROM POLICY LINK THANK YOU. THE WATER CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU.

CALPERS JOB WE PRETTY. AUTHORS EFFORTS IN THIS AREA HOWEVER AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH TO ENHANCE LEAD RELATED PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS AND COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE CONFUSION OR POTENTIAL SLOWDOWN. EFFORTS TO GET ANY REMAINING LED OUT OF THE WATER SUPPLY. USEPA IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FINALIZE THE FIRST MAJOR UPDATE TO THE LEAD AND COPPER RULE IN NEARLY THIRTY YEARS THE NEW RULE ENSURES PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN IN COMMUNITIES FROM THE RISKS OF LEAD EXPOSURE. ANY PA'S EVEN GO FARTHER THE NEW REGULATORY PROCESS CALLED LEAD AND COPPER RULE IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPLY STATE. BY THE OPERATE IS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WHILE C. R. I. MAYES. THE DAY IMPINJ. AB ONE STILL TWENTY BEFORE THE TWO NOW AND- EIGHT THE GLOBAL LEADER I THE STATE'S LEADING COPPER RULE TO COMPLY WITH THE FED REQUIRE. AND THAT WORKING ALREADY UNDER WAY. THERE'S ALSO A BIG STATE BY OF OURS COMMUTER WATER SYSTEM TO COMBAT IT INTO. OF KNOWN USER SERVICE LINES WITHIN THEIR JUST SAYS. AND IT HAS A TWO. AND FOR LINE IN THOSE ARE. BUT MAY BE BY TWENTY TWENTY. WATER SYSTEMS THAT REPORTED ANY LEAD USER SERVICE LINES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW LAW RECEIVED IN AMENDMENTS TO ITS PART HE WATER OPERATING PERMIT THAT CONTAINED ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS PUTTING THE CATION FOR. IN THE PLAYING I'M SOME OF WHICH IS TO IN THE BILL. ALREADY FOR CAL WATER'S. FIRED HAS THIS YEAR SYSTEM THROUGH PERMIT AMENDMENT AB FORTY SIX AM WORK WITH CHILD CARE. TO TEST THEIR WATER SO. GIVEN THIS EXTENSIVE WORK TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND PENDING STATE ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS EIGHTEEN JAN THIRTY ONE ASSEMBLY. TO WELL THE INTENT OF VISION IN THE BILL SIMILAR TO FEDERAL. THEY'RE NOT ENTIRELY CAN STAND IT THE PARTS WILL. WITH OR DO REGULATIONS. AS SO THE BILL COULD ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN AND- TO PROTECT AND. WE CAN MEMBER. IN A MINUTE THEY ADDRESS ONE OF THE CAN BUT ALSO. FURTHER CONFUSION ARE FOUNDATIONAL CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL REMAIN WE URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU- ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION.

GOOD AFTERNOON WINDOW A WESTERN CENTER ON MON TOP IN SUPPORT. AND NO ONE ELSE IS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT- QUESTIONS FOR EITHER SUPPORT OPPOSITION. THIS COMMERCIAL G. THANK YOU OF SINCE SIR MISTER BENNETT IS FILLING IN FOR MISERY OF US ALL DIRECT THE QUESTION TO- MS LITTLE- SO- COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE MINISTRY TILDES CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY SLOW THINGS DOWN IN TERMS. BUT ABATEMENT WELL ACTUALLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ACCORDING TO TIMELINE SUBMITTED TO THE WATER BOARD AT THIS POINT THIS YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALMOST HALF OF THOSE WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE REPORTED LED LOCKS HAVE ALREADY MOVED FORWARD AND REMOVED THEIR LINES UNDER THE SYSTEM THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S AN WHAT WITHOUT. CONTROLS BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX MORE THAN SIXTY SEVEN ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE SYSTEM WILL HELP SYSTEMS WILL HAVE ALREADY REMOVED THEIR LINES. AND THIS IS IN ADVANCE ESSENTIALLY THIS HAPPENING PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL. HIS ARE COMING UP. JUST WHAT EFFECT TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BEYOND AND IF THE SYSTEMS HAVE REMOVED THEIR LEAD LINES THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH ANY FURTHER INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THING THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- THE DESCRIPTION OF THE LEAD LINE REMOVALS THAT THIS. THAT- THAT AND PRESENTED AND ARE BASICALLY WHAT'S WHAT'S LOOK WHAT'S MISSING IN THE CALIFORNIA FRAMEWORK- IT'S THAT THE SCHEME OF BLOODLINE REMOVALS. IS THAT GALVANIZE LINES ATTACHED TO LED FITTINGS WHICH- DOCTOR OLSON FROM MICHIGAN TALKED ABOUT. THOSE ARE NOT CONSIDERED LEAD SERVICE LINES IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE IN OTHER STATES LIKE IN MICHIGAN AND SO DOES GALVANIZE LINES THAT ARE NOW CONTAMINATED. BY BEING A TOUCH LED FITTINGS. ARE NOT SUBJECT TO REMOVAL OR CONTROL OR CONTROL UNDER OUR SYSTEM. THE WATER BOARD HAS INDICATED THERE'S OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND REMAINING GALVANIZE LINES THE STATE. AND MANY AT THAT THEY KNOW OF AND THAT MANY AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THOSE WOULD BE. AT OR HAVE BEEN AT. AND STATE IS NOT. TO DATE AND THAT'S WHAT AB NINE NINETEEN THIRTY ONE IS TRYING TO DO BY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF A LEAD SERVICE LINE THAT THAT IS SUBJECT TO THIS OVERSIGHT AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS. SO YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED THIS BILL IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN EFFORTS FOR LEAD ABATEMENT- NO NO. ACT IT'LL IT'LL OUR POSITION IS THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY- MOVE MOVE THOSE SO MUCH HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT IN IN IN THE LIMITED WAY RIGHT NOW THAT'LL ACTUALLY MOVE- WILL MOVE THAT MOVE THE LEAD ABATEMENT FORWARD BY- BY REQUIRING THE SYSTEM WELL. THIS COUPLED WITH THE POTENTIAL OF THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW WHICH ALLOWS SYSTEMS TO. PAY FOR IT WILL BE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE WILL ALLOW SYSTEMS TO PAY FOR FULL LEAD SERVICE LINE REPLACEMENTS BUT IF WE DON'T EXPAND THE DEFINITION THIS WAY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE TIMES SO WE WOULD SAY THEY JUST AREN'T. MOVE FORWARD AS COMPREHENSIVELY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE ASSISTANCE TO USERS THANKS AND ALL JUST APPEAL THE DAY WERE. JACK BUT- IN THE END THE WATER BOARD A ALL OF THIS AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY WILL EAT LETTER KNOW OR THEY'LL BE A VETO SO- HE SIGHED WITH THE- PROPONENTS- BUT THE WATER BOARD WILL BE THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OF THIS SAID. I HATE I HAVE THEIR FIVE VERY DEDICATED COMMISSIONERS GREAT STAFF. I THINK THEY WILL MAKE A FINAL DECISION AS TO WHAT HAPPENS ON THIS WE THINK WE ARE WE THINK THIS BILL IS ON TARGET. YOU THINK IT WELL AS BEST WE CAN TELL REALIZE MY STAFF YEAH. AND- YES AND MY STAFF HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA- BUT AGAIN ULTIMATELY IT'LL BE THE WATER PORT THAT WILL DECIDE AND THEY'LL EITHER LIKE THE BILL OR THEY WON'T. AND SO I'M NOT. IF FOR SOME REASON. IT WOULD SLOW IT DOWN THE WATER BOARD TO KNOCK IT ALLOW PETS AND I BELIEVE AS WAS JUST STATED HERE THAT'LL SPEED UP AND YOU THINK IT'LL SLOW IT DOWN AND- YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. AS CHAIR FEKIR BOB ON ON BEHALF OF- OF THE AUTHOR BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF RIGHT OF WHAT IS COVERED IT THEREFORE EXPANDS THE REVENUE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ENTIRE VERSION. THAT IS A WAY TO SPEED UP AB NOT MAY NOT BE SPEEDING UP STUFF THAT WAS ALREADY PLANNED BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SO MUCH MORE YOU'RE SPEEDING UP STUFF THAT WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN DONE AT ALL BECAUSE IT EXPANDS. APPRECIATIVE THAT COMMITTEE STAFFERS NODDING THEIR HEAD THAT I GOT THAT RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE MYSTERY OF US RIGHT NOW AND THERE IS ALSO TIME TO WORK. WITH- THEY WERE. CEASE M. THE AUTHOR AND ARE I HOPE THAT YOU COULD COME TO AN AGREEMENT BUT- SINCE THE AUTHORIZATION HERE I WILL SPEAK FOR HER AND SAY I KNOW SHE'LL WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT- WELL THEN WILL WE TAKE WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS A CLOSE- I HAVE- YOU HAVE A CLOSE AND SO I THINK I SHOULD SAY THAT SENSITIVE FOR BIG WORK TARGET IT. ONE IS SLATED TO RECEIVE BILLIONS DOLLARS THE FEDERAL BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW FOR THESE REPLACEMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS UNPRECEDENTED AND MUST CAPITALIZE ON THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE MOVING PIECES TO THIS BILL AND- I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY OPPONENTS THE WATER BOARD IN THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD JUST. ADVANCE DAY RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL WHICH TRIGGERED. SO I THINK THIS BILL GOES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR REASONS STATED BY PERMANENT- AND LET'S SEE WE HAVE A MOTION YET. OKAY ARAMBULA GARCIA- CHAU LET'S GO. THIS IS ITEM TO. AB NINETEEN THIRTY ONE LUCENT REVISE THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CORK BY CORK I SMITH. ARAMBULA ARAMBULA I KALRA AYE CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I MATHIS. WHAT SAID SHE WANTED TO CHECK AYE WALDRON. SIX WE HAVE SIX VOTES SO THAT'S OUT- GRADUATIONS. VERY GOOD AND THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THAT BELL MISTER BENNETT. OKAY MYSTIKAL. SIR YOU HAVE A LONG HISTORY. YEAH YEAH. THIS. IN HERE. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WE HAVE CHAIR COURT. A. B. TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE. WHEN OKAY ALL RIGHT. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR PRO TEM. AND MEMBERS- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT OUR STAFF BOTH COMMITTEE STAFF AND- MY STAFF MARIE CANAL WHO WAS BECOME AN EXPERT. OR AT LEAST TALK TO THE EXPERTS- HAS FOUND OUT A LOT MORE ABOUT THE BAY DELTA ESTUARY THEN I KNEW THAT WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT- SO THE- ESTUARY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA OF COURSE PARTICULARLY WHERE I LIVE IN THE AREA. IT TWENTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IRRIGATION TO FOUR AND A HALF MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. AND CRITICAL HABITAT FOR MANY NAY FOR NATIVE SPECIES RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE WATER IN THE BAY DELTA BY ADOPTING AND IMPLEMENTING WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES AS PART OF THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN OR WE'LL JUST CALL IT THE BAY DELTA PLAN. HOW ARE THE LAST MAJOR UPDATE TO THE PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. IN FACT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR THREE YEARS AND- THAT'S NINE UPDATED MISSED NINE UPDATES MISSED. UP SINCE THEN THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT AND CLIMATE TO A CRISIS HAD BEGUN TO WRECK HAVOC ON THE DELTA COUPLED WITH OTHER FACTORS. THIS IS TRIMMING SOME NATIVE FISH TO THE BRINK OF PART OF- THANK CHEN AND SOME TO EXTEND. WHEN THE WATER BOARD STARTED THE MOST RECENT UPDATE TO THE BAY DELTA PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND DIED. THAT'S WHEN THEY STARTED THIS PROCESS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. YOU COULD STILL FIND DELTA SMELT IN THE DELTA. BUT I REMEMBER HEARING FROM EXPERTS THEY SAID IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY THE SMELTER GONE. AND THE SMELTER GONE- WILL SMELL TO HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND IN THE DELTA OF THE WILD FOR FOUR YEARS THEY DO HAVE SOME IN THE TANK. BUT CHAD THEY THIS IS ONE OF THESE. SPECIES THAT EXISTED IN VERY LARGE NUMBERS NOT AT ALL CLEAR YOU COULD BRING THEM BACK BY PUTTING IN A STARTER POPULATION WHEN. IF THE DELTA IS EVER GOING TO BE BETTER SO THEY MAY BE GONE FOREVER. REPORTS BY WHAT OUR LAW EXPERTS AND LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE HE FOUND THAT UPDATES DEBATE OUT TO PLAN. ARE URGENT NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA MAKING WATER DATA FISH AND THE WATERSHED ITSELF FROM WORSENING THREATS CLOSE BY THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND DROUGHT. THE LACK OF MODERN WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ALSO HURTS LONG TERM PLANNING FOR WATER PROJECTS BY CREATING UNCERTAINTY IF THERE'S A PLAN YOU CAN SAY I WANT TO DO X. AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAN THANK YOU DO A- YOU YOU YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S GOING TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE WATER BOARD WANTS TO DO. SO THIS BOAT THIS BILL CO DEFIES THE CURRENT GOAL OF THE STATE WATER BOARD STAFF TO ADAPT AND IMPLEMENTED UPDATE TO THE BELT BAY DELTA PLAN BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IF THE DEADLINES THIS PLANNER MESS THE WATER BOARD. NOW UNDER THIS BILL YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE HAD ONE SPECIES. COACH TANKED AND SEVERAL OTHERS ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. SO IF THE DEADLINES MIX MR GAS AND WE WERE JUST SAID HERE IS YOUR DEADLINE. IT IT JUST IT COULD IGNORE IT SO WE HAVE A CONSEQUENCE. AND THAT CONSEQUENCE IS THE THIRD BE A PAUSE IN ISSUE WE KNEW WATER RIGHTS THAT WOULD A DISH THAT WOULD DIVERT ADDITIONAL FLOW AWAY FROM THE DELTA. OUR HOPE WOULD BE THAT HAVE THE PLAN DONE IS STAFF SAID THEY COULD. I THINK END OF THIS YEAR- BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN THIS WOULD COME INTO EFFECT WE FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD IN FACT- SPUR THE- THE WATER BOARD TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION. THIS TEMPORARY MORATORIUM AXES AN INCENTIVE TO COMPLETE THE AB- ADAPTION OF THE BAY DELTA PLAN AND ENSURES THAT THESE WATER RIGHTS PERMITS CAN BE ASSESSED USING CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS. SO ONCE YOU HAVE A PLAN YOU CAN THEN SAY- YES THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN WE CAN ISSUE THE WATER RIGHTS. MOVING FORWARD I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE OPPOSITION TO AVOID UNINTENDED IMPACTS PROJECTS IF POSSIBLE. AND AGAIN WE- WE ARE ALLOWING RENEWAL OF CURRENT WATER RIGHT SO IF YOU EVER CURRENT WATER RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT. THEY'VE COME TO THE NEW PLAN BUT HOPEFULLY THEY WELL AND NONE OF THIS WILL EVER GOING TO AFFECT. IT YOU PROBABLY A NUMBER OF YOU'VE DONE WHAT I DO WHICH IS TO SET A DEADLINE FOR AN AGENCY AND IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. WITH ME TOO. CLIFFORD LEVY WHO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR FORTY YEARS. IN PERSON OR ISSUE IS OKAY FROM WHAT COMES DID YOU SO MUCH- DOCTOR CORK AND- MISTER LEE. PLEASE EVERYBODY YOU MAY GO AHEAD AND- AND TESTIFY. SO THERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER. AFTERNOON A- MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER ARE- AMONG PERSONAL I WANT TO A THIS SUMMER BY BY THE CHAIRMAN IS EXCELLENT HI I'M JUST GOING TO CUP COVER UP A COUPLE OF SHORT ISSUES MY NAME IS CLIFF LEE AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE. I'M A RETIRED CALIFORNIA DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IS. OVER FORTY. FOR YOUR WATER BOTTLE. REPRESENTING AGENTS OF STATE CAL LITIGATION OVER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ONLY TWO PRIOR WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLANS. UP TO DENY SO. AND WHEN IT DOES NOT NINETY FIVE ALL WHICH RESORTED IN RESOLUTION IN FRONT COURT OF APPEAL DECISIONS ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH I'VE DONE MOST OF MY PROFESSIONAL WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE I'M HERE ON MY BEHALF AND NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY AGENCY THE CITY CALIFORNIA OR- POINT. RECENTLY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF WATER RESOURCE SPECIALISTS MANY OF THEM ACADEMICS BUT OTHERS WERE WATER PRACTITIONERS ON A PROJECT TO REVIEW CALIFORNIA WATER RIGHT SMALL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. FIFTY THREE THE GROUP RELEASED ITS REPORT WHICH INCLUDES A RECOMMENDATION TO SET A DEADLINE FOR COMPLETION OF THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY PLAN UP TWENTY SIX THIRTY NOT. I WOULD LIKE FOCUS ON ONE KEY REASON SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. BY PROVIDING REGULATORY CERTAINTY FOR PROPOSED PROJECTS THAT DIVERT FROM THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY THIRTY NINE ALLOWS WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE STATE TO MOVE FOR MORE PROMPTLY TO COMPLETION IMPLEMENTATION NOW WHY IS THAT SO- VIABILITY OF A WATER PROJECT BUTTE A DIVERSION TO GROUNDWATER STORAGE. WILD OR SIR RESTORE. THE PROJECT A SPOON OPERATING QUITE. JACKIE TO THE COURSE PROD BENEFITS ARE IN THIS LINKED TO PROJECT OPERATING CRITERIA THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE OPERATING CRITERIA FOR ANY PROJECT TO DIVERT FROM THE INTEL TO WATERSHED THEREFORE THE VIABILITY OF ANY PROJECT AFFECTING. THAT AFFECTS ALSO DEPENDS UPON THE RESOLUTION OF THESE OBJECTIVES. BY SETTING A CALENDAR DEADLINE FOR THE BAY DELTA PLAN UPDATES AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE PERMITS THE PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING OPERATING CRITERIA TO MOVE FROM GUESSWORK AND SPECULATION THE ACTUAL REALITY THUS ALLOWING FOR THE- INFORMED CONSIDERATION OF WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S WATER FUTURE. FOR THAT KEY REASON I WOULD URGE BUT THIS- COMMITTEE- TO APPROVE AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR LEE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN THE HEARING ROOM TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY NINE.

AND MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BE GOT- THE MIX OF THE CALLS IN THERE THAT WANT TO COME BACK TO THE ROOM FOR ANY PRIMARY OPPOSITION WITNESSES. YEAH. THANK YOU CHAIR KALRA IN MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND THAT IS FOR THREE REASONS AND I'LL COVER THE THREE. SO FIRST JUST THAT SUBDIVISION C. BE DELETED THERE'S ONLY THREE SUBDIVISIONS IN THE BILL SUBDIVISION FEES SHOULD BE DELETED. THIS IS THE PROPOSED CONSEQUENCE FOR THE SITUATION IF THE WATER BOARD MISSED THE TWO DEADLINES FOR PROPOSED ACTIONS UNDER THE BILL WOULDN'T AFFECT THE WATER BOARD WHAT IT WOULD D IS PUT ON HOLD A TOOL THAT WATER MANAGERS NEED AND THAT IS THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN A WATER RIGHTS. FOR THE DIVERSION OF WATER FROM THE WATERSHED TO SURFACE WATER STORAGE. ONE EXAMPLE UNDER THIS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A POSSIBLE DELAY FOR THE SITES RESERVOIR THAT'S A PROPOSITION ONE PROJECT WHICH WOULD BENEFIT SALMON. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE DELAY OF PROJECTS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT WOULD PROVIDE OR HELP PROVIDE A RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY FOR COMMUNITIES IN THE VALLEY PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE'S- DECREASING GROUNDWATER PUMPING UNDER SIGMA. SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S A SUBDIVISION AIM BE GIVE PROPOSED DEADLINES FOR WATER BOARD ACTIONS AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE DEADLINES DO NOT AFFORD ENOUGH TIME FOR INCORPORATION OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THROUGH AGREEMENTS. AND YOU MAY HAVE SEEN JUST RECENTLY THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THIS WAS ON MARCH TWENTY NINTH A KEY MILESTONE FOR THEIR WORK IN THIS AREA YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT FROM MR LINK. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSED DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE DEADLINE FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE FINAL BE DELTA PLAN UPDATE WE THINK THAT WOULD. IN A LONG TIME TO GET TO THIS FOR BUT WHEN YOU'RE AT THE END YOU DON'T WANT TO RUSH THE PUBLIC PROCESS FEES THAT HAPPENED. AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT TO PROCESS ABOUT ON STAKEHOLDER INPUT INTO THE PROCESS SEES AND ONE OF THE PROCESS USES THE SEEK WHAT PART OF THIS THAT'S- A CRITICAL. THE THIRD ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S A PROPOSED DEADLINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A PLAN AMENDMENT THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED RECENTLY AND TO PLANT AMENDMENT FOR THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. AND FOR THAT PLAN AMENDMENT THURS ONGOING LITIGATION RIGHT NOW AND WE THINK THAT THE AMENDMENT IGNORES AT LITIGATE AND- TO GET TO WHERE WE ONLY. HONOR IS WORKING FOR. SO WE RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN OUR LETTER TO SUBDIVISION A AND B. AND DELETION OF SUBDIVISION C. BUT WITH THE BILL IN THE CURRENT FORM THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS ACURALINK WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION- CINEMA QUICKLY WHEN IF IT SAY THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WORKABLE SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS ALL- WE DO CONCUR WITH DOCTORS ASSESSMENT AND STILL OF AN OPPOSING. AMENDED ON AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE. WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE BILL WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE RECENTLY SIGNED HABITAT AGREEMENTS. BENEFITING FISH WILDLIFE IN THE BACK ELTA. CINDY MENTIONED IN% TWENTY TWENTY TO. COALITION WORKING SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN SIGNED A HABITAT INSTREAM FLOW AGREEMENT AND- YOU IN ATTENDANCE WITH THE GOVERNOR. BUREAU OF RECLAMATION NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES CDFW CDFA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER- MATT STATE WATER CONTRACTORS REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY AND MANY OTHER WATER ORGANIZATIONS AND SOME WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONS ALL WORKING TO INCREASE SALMON AND MIGRATORY BIRD POPULATIONS AND BETTER DELTA WATER QUALITY.

I'M JUST I'M JUST LIKE YOU TO BE ON THEIR TOES HERE. PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS BRENDA BASS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK THAT'S ALL THE PHONE CALLS AND PEOPLE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OPPOSITION SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTIONS. THAT'S JUST JUST JUST ONE QUICK COMMENT ABOUT WHAT WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFICULT THINGS TO DO- HE IS ALWAYS EASY TO SAY WE NEED MORE TIME WE NEED MORE TIME AND WELL INTENTIONED PEOPLE. CAN FIND THEMSELVES WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL LOTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS TOGETHER BUT- I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WE'RE WAY PAST DEADLINES AND WHERE WAS THE SENSE OF URGENCY. WHEN WE WERE COMING UP ON THOSE LINES THIS WAS IT. TELL ASSEMBLY LIKE DOCTOR CROKES BURKE ACTUALLY COMES UP WITH A CONSEQUENCE AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THAT THIS IS NOT A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE WATER BOARD BUT CERTAINLY IF THE WATER BOARD WANTS TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THOSE NEGATIVE THINGS YOU IDENTIFY THAT WON'T HAPPEN- DON'T HAPPEN THEY NEED TO GET MOVING AND M. AND- WORK ON THE PLAN AND- SO I JUST THINK AT SOME POINT TIME YOU HAVE TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND HAVE A CONSEQUENCE RATHER THAN JUST HAVING AGENCIES. WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCE AT ALL DISTRICT NOR VIRTUALLY IGNORE DEADLINES- S. AS A HAVE SO HIGH IN THIS AREA IN PARTICULAR I THINK WE SEE THIS JUST PATTERSON A GREAT DEAL FIVE OF THE AUTHOR FOR TRYING TO COME UP WITH A CREATIVE WAY TO INFUSE SOME SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY GET TO THE PROCESS THANK YOU. THE OKAY. YES MY MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER PART TIME SHARE- I. BEING AVAIL GUY A. DEFINITELY HAVE VAST CONCERNS WITH THIS EXPRESSION AS WE LOOK AT WATER SUPPLIES WITH THE KID FOLLOWING 30% OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION- WE LOOK AT WHAT UKRAINE IS DOING WITH FOOD SUPPLY GLOBALLY- AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME IT AT THIS TIME TO THINK OF. US PASSING ANY MEASURE. THAT COULD POSSIBLY CHANGE ANY FLOWS OF WATER SOUTH INTO OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS ESPECIALLY. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT FOOD SECURITIES GLOBALLY. YOU KNOW PART PART OF ME IS REALLY THINKING WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE TO GET MORE WATER SUPPLY DOWN THERE. AND LOOKING AT INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS ON THE AGRICULTURE SPACE TO COVER DOWN WHAT WE'RE LOSING GLOBALLY. AND MAY I KNOW THE THIS BILL AS WELL INTENDED. I THINK MISTER BENNETT'S POINTS ABOUT. KICKING THE AGENCIES A LITTLE BIT TO GET THAT ACTUALLY DO BUSINESS IS A- MULTI. I DO THINK THIS IS SOME THAT COMES TODAY- BECAUSE WE WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE WATER FLOWING IN CAN'T HAVE THINGS GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M IS THAT. TRANSACTION IN A MOTION AND A SECOND DR CORPUS ARTICLES YES THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS BOB THIS WOULD NOT AFFECT ANYTHING IN THE CURRENT WATER SUPPLY- IT TOOK IT WOULD AFFECT NEW- TAKING FROM THE DELTA BUT IT SHOULDN'T AFFECT YOUR AREA. IN THE LAST. I UNDERSTAND YOUR OPPOSITION- THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THAT- YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION IS SAID THIS CAN'T BE DONE ON TIME- THE WATER WE HAVE- OPEN PHONE LINE. TO THE WATER BOARD. THEY COULD TELL US ANYTIME THAT THEY DON'T LIKE THIS DEADLINE AND I WILL CHANGE. OF WE HAVE AN OPEN LINE TO THE GOVERNOR. IF THE WATER BUT FEELS THAT THE VISA ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AGENCY CAN'T BE RESOLVED IN TIME I'M SURE THEY WILL LEAVE THE LET US KNOW WHERE THEY WILL VETO IT. SILENCE IS GOLDEN SO FAR NO ONE IS SUBJECTING TO THE TIMELINE WE'VE SET. UP THAT'S AS FAR AS I CAN GET- UP WITH THE STAFFERS SAID THEY CAN HAVE THE WORK DONE. AND IF THEY OBJECTED IF THEY HAVE A CONCERN THEY WILL REACH OUT TO US OR THEY WILL VETO THE BILL SO I'M NOT WORRIED. ABOUT THE THINGS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP BECAUSE I THINK THE WATER BOARD IS JUST AS ANXIOUS TO HAVE THIS ADDITIONAL WATER TO THE DELTA JUST AS AS YOU ALL ARE. SO I- I FEEL THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW THEY'LL LET US KNOW IF IT CAN'T BE DONE YOU GOT YOU GOT AN AYE VOTE GET RAIN WATER. OKAY I WON FIVE. ALL RIGHT. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW LET. AB TWO.
