WE'RE ABSOLUTE QUORUM HOWEVER WE WILL GO AHEAD AND PROCEED CENTER BRADFORD YOU HAVE ONE BUILDER PRESENT TODAY SENATE BILL SIX OH THREE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT SIX OH THREE AND IT'S JUST A- BILL THAT HOPES ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT EXIST IN THE CANNABIS. INDUSTRY AS IT RELATES TO. EQUITY ACCESSIBILITY. AND THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM OF FUNDING FEE WAIVER AND DEFERRAL IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN I'VE FOUGHT THIRD IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB FIVE NINE FIVE THE CREATED A FEE WAIVER AND DEFERRAL PROGRAM TO HELP THOSE BUSINESSES STRUGGLING TO ENTER THE SPACE AS WE KNOW IT'S COSTLY TO GET IN HIS FACE. BUT I ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AUTHOR S. B. TWELVE NINETY FOUR WHICH WERE CREATED TO SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM THAT'S PROVIDED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO GRANTS TO ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO. ENCOURAGE MINORITY OWNED WOMEN OWNED AND VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES STANDARD TO SPACE BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO HELP EQUITY BECAUSE- BUSINESSES BECAUSE OVERCOME DECADES OF HARM INDICATED BY THE SO CALLED WAR ON DRUGS- LOCAL EQUITY APPLICANTS STILL NEED TO PAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IN FEES ALONE BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN THINK ABOUT OPENING THEIR DOORS HEARD FROM PLENTY OF MY CONCERN WITH. THE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE PAID HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEASES AND- SET UP EQUIPMENT AND ALL THAT AND THEY STILL. DON'T HAVE A LICENSE TO BEGIN SO. THOSE FEES ARE IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER UPFRONT COSTS OF STARTING A BUSINESS SUCH AS THIS. THAT'S ENOUGH SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AS I STATED I AUTHORED- SB FIVE NINETY FIVE IT OUGHT TO BE AUTHORIZED THE LEGISLATION TO CREATE A DEFERRAL AND WAIVER PROGRAM. FOR APPLICANTS LICENSING AND RENEWAL FEES OF EQUITY IN NEEDS BASED APPLICANTS. ARE SALLY THIS PRO WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED- AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR AS INTENDED DO TO A LACK OF RESOURCES. SB SIX OH THREE RESPONSE TO THAT FAILURE BY STOPPING TWO PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF SB FIVE NINE FIVE. THE FIRST IS IT REQUIRES CANNABIS LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH THE FEE FOR DEFERRAL AND WAIVER PROGRAM AND SECOND IT IS DOLLARS THE TAX CREDIT. FOR FEES PAID BY LOCAL EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES BE WAIVERS AND DEFERRALS DIRECTLY SUPPORT NEED BASED AND EQUITY BUSINESSES. THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TOOLS WE HAVE TO MITIGATE TO SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY AND RACISM THAT IS PERFECT PERPETRATED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS. THIS BILL AVANCES THE CONVERSATION OF FEE RELIEF. FOR EQUITY IN NEEDS BASED APPLICANTS WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS THIS IS A LONG OVERDUE SOLUTION. TO THIS ISSUE ND I ITS URGENT URGENTLY NEEDED AND PROVEN BY- MANY LOCAL EQUITY BUSINESSES WHO STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE- THAT BEING SAID I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS MEASURE IS ADAM SPIKER. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CELL PHONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COALITION. THANK YOU SENATOR MISTER SPEICHER PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR IN SENATORS- GET MY NAME'S ADAM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COALITION. FIRST OFF I WANT TO THANK SENATOR BRADFORD. AUTHORING THIS MEASURE AND OTHERS THAT THE PAST FEW YEARS AS THE- EXPLAINED. IT BASICALLY JUST PROVIDING HELP FOR LOCAL SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS GIVING THEM. MORE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE STATE TO TRY TO HELP INSURE SIX THAT. THE VERY MUCH OF. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIRD- COALITION WAS STARTED OVER FIVE YEARS AGO TO COLLAPSE OLFACTION YOU TO BE INDUSTRY IN LOS ANGELES UNDER ONE UMBRELLA AND WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE CANNABIS REGULATION LICENSING TAXATION ENFORCEMENT. AND SOCIAL EQUITY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FROM THE CITY COUNCIL AND A PUBLIC VOTE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AT OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. BUT WHILE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE IN LOS ANGELES THERE ARE ALREADY MORE APPLICATIONS BEING PROCESSED UNDER THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM. THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY. ALL PROP SIXTY. AND THEN CREATING BALCARCE WERE GROUNDBREAKING MILESTONES FOR LEGAL CANNABIS TO CALIFORNIA. THERE'D BEEN MANY PROBLEMS LEFT UNADDRESSED THAT AFFECT THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY THE ABILITY FOR LICENSE HOLDERS TO COMPETE AGAINST THE ILLICIT MARKET. HIGH TAXES AND REGULATORY COSTS THE LEGAL OPERATOR FOLLOWED IN THE ILLICIT IGNORES. AND FINALLY THE ROLL OUT AND SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AND THE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. TRYING TO GET THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE. FOR ADDITIONAL CONTACTS OVER 50% OF LOCAL AND STATE APPLICATION APPLICATIONS FOR CANNABIS LICENSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NEVER EVEN END UP GETTING OPEN FOR BUSINESS. I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THE WAY THE BILLS DRAFTED IF WE CAN GET THE SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS LICENSE OPEN FOR BUSINESS AND PAYING TAXES. ONLY THEN WILL THE TAX WRITE OFF COMPONENT BE APPLICABLE. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. IT IS UNFORTUNATELY NOT A CERTAINTY. THAT SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSES WILL GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE RELIEF THIS BILL CAN PROVIDE. UNFORTUNATELY NO SILVER BULLET TO FIXING ALL THE ISSUES THE LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY FACES TODAY AND THE CHALLENGES SOCIAL EQUITY APPLICANTS GO THROUGH TO TRY TO GET A LICENSE. TO GET OPEN BEEN COMPETE IN A STILL HEAVILY ILLICIT MARKETPLACE BUT SENATOR BRAD BIRD'S SB SIX OH THREE THE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY- A LAUNDRY LIST ABOUT THE FRONT COST THANK YOU SENATOR PRODUCT. THAT IS EQUITY. HAS TO INCUR BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN OPEN THEIR DOORS FOR BUSINESS. SECURING PROPERTY. GETTING LEGAL ADVICE APPLICATION WRITING BUILD OUT COSTS. GETTING INVENTORY HIRING STAFF. AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT LOCAL AND STATE LICENSING FEES JUST TO NAME A FEW MOST OF THESE COSTS CAN'T EVEN BE WRITTEN OFF LIKE A NORMAL BUSINESS COULD BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL STANCE ON CANNABIS ANY PARTICULAR TO EIGHTY EACH. WITH THE IRS I WOULD ARGUE THE ASSISTANCE PROVIDED IN SB SIX OH THREE WILL HELP MORE BUSINESSES ACTUALLY GET OPEN START MAKING LEGAL CELL AND START PAYING LOCAL AND STATE TAXES. WHERE THE REBATE FROM SIX THIRTY SIX OH THREE WOULD PROVIDE ASSISTANCE EACH YEAR. EXCEPT FOR WILL ALLOW SOCIAL I APPLE AND LYFT IN COLDER TO WRITE OFF THEIR AND STATE THESE.

THE REORGANIZATION OF THE THREE ENTITIES RIGHT NOW THAT DO THE LICENSING INTO ONE LICENSE- ENTITY AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THESE- SEQUOIA THE SEQUOIA- PROCESS IS IT IT REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE THE LEAD AGENCY AND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVEN'T REALLY MOVED AT LIKE THEY SHOULD AND IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO HOW WE GET SEEK A- A PROCESS HE'S GOING AND GET THEM DONE IN IN A IN A EXPEDITIOUS MANNER SO THE SIX YEARS GIVES US OUR HORIZON TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT.

THE BILL HAS ELEVEN VOTES AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. IT SYMBOL IN THE SENATE BILL. ONE TWO ZERO TWO. I'M IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR THINKER YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN MY REMARKS BY THINKING THAT SHARING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF ON AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ENSURE WE ARE PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS I ALSO WANT TO COMMIT TO TAKING THE AGREED UPON AMENDMENTS INTO THE BILL BEFORE IT IS HEARD IN THE GEO COMMITTEE IF THE BILL PASSES TODAY. SENATE BILL ONE O. TWO SIX TO PROVIDE SOME COMMONSENSE PROTECTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES A YEAR AGO CALIFORNIA WAS UNDER IMMENSE PRESSURE TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF KEVIN AND TO CURB THE PRIMARY VECTORS OF TRANSMISSION IN THIS EFFORT THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ISSUED THE FIRST IN THE NATION STATEWIDE STATE HOME ORDER THAT FORCED BUSINESSES TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS. RESTAURANTS BARS AND HAIR SALONS ROLE REQUIRED TO SHUT DOWN MANY OF THEM PERMANENTLY AT THE BEGINNING MANY OF US ACCEPTED THE SOBERING FACT THAT CLOSURES WERE NECESSARY TO TRY AND MITIGATE THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS VIRUS AS A WEEKS A MONTH PASSED BY IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SHUT DOWN ORDERS WERE HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THESE INDUSTRIES. THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN THIS STUDY FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUND THAT DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE SHUTDOWN ORDERS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESTAURANTS PERMANENTLY. OR TEMPORARILY CLOSED THEIR DOORS LEAVING THREE MILLION WORKERS WITHOUT JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE YEP STUDY INDICATED THAT MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES WILL HAVE PERMANENTLY SHUT THEIR DOORS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE STILL HOVERING AROUND 9% IN THE CONTINUED LIMITATION TO RESTAURANTS AND BARS I BELIEVE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO CUT THEM SOME REGULATORY SLACK. S. B. WANTED TO AS AMENDED WILL NARROWLY TAILOR. EXCUSE ME IS A NARROWLY TAILORED MEASURES SEEKING TO PROHIBIT THE REVOCATION SUSPENSION OR ISSUANCES OF FINES AND PENALTIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES DEMONSTRATED THEY COMPLIED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH ORDERS AND CITATIONS DURING THE STATE SHUTDOWN ORDERS. THE CHANGING NATURE OF EMERGENCY ORDERS FROM MONTH TO MONTH CREATED HARDSHIPS FOR MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES SEEKING TO COMPLY. FROM BEING FORCED TO LIMIT CAPACITY 25% TO PURCHASING TENTS AND HEATERS AND PICNIC TABLES AND OTHER OUTDOOR COVERINGS FOR OUTDOOR DINING THESE BUSINESSES HAVE TRIED TO PLAY BY THE RULES BUT SOME STILL FOUND THEMSELVES IN VIOLATIONS OF ONE THING OR ANOTHER. CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME WHILE THE GAME IS BEING PLAYED I IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE TREATING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THE RESTAURANT HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY OFTEN OPERATE ON SHOESTRING MARGINS WERE ANY LIMITATION ON DINING CAPACITY INDOORS OR OUT CAN BE CATASTROPHIC FINANCIALLY. IF THE SMALL BUSINESSES FACE LENGTHY SUSPENSIONS OR REVOCATIONS FOR MINOR AND CURABLE INFRACTIONS AS A STATE BEGINS TO REOPEN. IT WILL ONLY ADD TO THEIR FINANCIAL PAIN. I DO APPLIED SEVENTY EFFORTS WE JUST AS A LEGISLATURE TAKEN TO ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES THIS YEAR ALREADY SUCH AS WAIVING LICENSE FEE RENEWALS AND PROVIDING GRANTS SOME OF THOSE BILLS WE HAVE VOTED ON JUST THIS MORNING IN THIS COMMITTEE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT ASSISTANCE DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. HARDSHIP RESTAURANT SOMEONE IN BURNERS TO REAP HAVE INSURED BY DEPUTIZED OFFICIALS SEEKING OUT VIOLATIONS. IN A MOMENT YOU WILL HEAR FROM TWO WITNESSES WHO CAN DESCRIBE TO YOU THE HARSH REALITY OF WHAT BUSINESS OWNERS ARE FACING. I HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THEIR PLIGHT AND FURTHER RECOGNIZE THE REASON WHY WE ARE PLANNING TO AMENDED THIS MEASURE FURTHER TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE BEING DEVASTATED. THE AMENDMENTS ARE VERY SIMPLE THEY PROHIBIT THE INITIATION OF FORMAL DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT ACTION WHICH MAY INCLUDE A FINE IMPOSING A PENALTY OR LICENSE REVOCATION. FOR LICENSEE'S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY KEVIN NINETEEN STATE OF EMERGENCY ORDER IF THE LICENSEE DEMONSTRATES THEY HAVE TAKEN CORRECTIVE ACTION TO RESPOND TO THESE NOTICES. I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE DANA TANNER THE OWNER SQUIRES A BAR IN THE HARBOR IN RESTAURANT CALLED RESTORATION LONG BEACH FOLLOWED BY MR MARC BERGER'S PRESIDENT OF THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONSULTING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YU SENATOR YOUR WITNESSES MAY PROCEED PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE TO IN SOME OF A . Y. OH TWO. IN MY PRACTICE AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LICENSE CONSULTANT I REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF LICENSEES AND LICENSED PREMISES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO OWN MULTIPLE LICENSE BUSINESSES INCLUDING SEVERAL BARS BOTH IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY. I HAVE BEEN CONSULTED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC I'VE BEEN CONSULTED MANY TIMES UP ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE MANY ORDERS THAT WERE. BUT PUBLISHED DURING THE OUTBREAK. THE COBIT ENDEMIC IS PUT BAR AND RESTAURANT OWNERS IN THE IN BETWEEN TWO EQUAL EQUAL BUT DIFFICULT CHOICES ALL OF THE IN EVER CHANGING HEALTH HOURS WHICH MEANT LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES CLOSING YOUR BUSINESS LOSING YOUR LIKE LIVELIHOOD OR BREAKING IN THE ORDERS AND ALSO AND FACING TOUGH PENALTIES AND FINES AND- POTENTIALLY ENDANGERING PUBLIC HEALTH. I COMMEND THE ABC FOR ALL OF THE FLEXIBILITY AND THEIR APPROACH TO ENFORCEMENT HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE AGENCY WAS TASKED WITH ENFORCING ORDERS THAT WERE NOT WITH IN THE PRIMARY MISSION OF ENFORCING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE LAW. UNLIKE OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT REGULATED BY SPECIFIC AGENCY THE ABC WITH LEVERAGE TO CREATE FEAR AMONG RESTAURANT OWNER AND BAR OWNERS IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE COMPLIANCE EVEN THOUGH THEIR ORDERS WERE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR COLLECTIVE RICH SERVICE. I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WILL BE REVIEWED LEAD YOU WILL LEAD THE ABC OF THE BURDEN OF TRYING TO BALANCE ITS DUTY OF ENFORCING THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS COMPASSION FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS OPERATORS THAT WERE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN TWO EVILS. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WOULD GIVE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO DID THE BEST THEY COULD UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES PEACE OF MIND THAT IF THEY WERE AND FORTUNATE TO SURVIVE THAT THEY WOULD DO NOT. HAVE ANY MORE EXPOSURE TO FINES AND PENALTIES I ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THE BILL. AND MOVING ON. TO VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

NOW COMPLIANT COME IN MANY FORMS FROM OUR RIGHT DISREGARDING THE HEALTH BORDERS I Q. EXCEEDING CAPACITY LIMITS NEGLECTING MATH REQUIREMENTS OR FAILURE TO REPORT CASES AMONG OTHER REQUIRING AGENCIES TO PROVE A DIRECT CORRELATION FOR EVERY INSTANCE OPEN ARIA OF NONCOMPLIANCE AND TRANSMISSION IS NOT FEASIBLE AND REFERS FURTHER SPREAD OF THE VIRUS EVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PANDEMIC LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS RELIED ON ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT IN THE SEATS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL WITH A KEY PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT I THINK ONE OF YOU WOULD PROHIBIT EIGHTY FEET HOWEVER TRYING PENALTY THEIR CLOSURES FOR EVEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES OF NON COMPLIANCE. BECAUSE A DIRECT CORRELATION FOR TRANSMISSION LEVINE AT WOULD HAVE TO BE ESTABLISHED FOR DURING AN EMERGENCY COULD ACTUALLY SAVE LIVES AND MUST NOT BE HINDERED AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT.

SHARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- THIS IS MIKE SKIP ON BEHALF OF ALCOHOL JUSTICE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THAT SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU LET'S TURN THE MATTER BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE CHAMBER AND- THOSE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY IF ANY. COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. SENATOR DODD. YOU'RE THE HIGHEST MIKE YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK- THE CHAIR TO HIM IN THE BILL'S AUTHOR FOR. YOUR WORKING ON SOME AMENDMENTS- BUT THAT'S AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE GEO I REALLY DID WANT TO RISK BE KEPT BRIEFLY TO THE PORTION OF THE BILL RELATED APARTMENT AT ABC. IT PROVIDES SOME CONTEXT. FIRST OF ALL ABC DOES NOT HAVE FIGHTING OF FORTY. THIS MEANS IT'S ABC CAN'T SIMPLY SHOW UP AND FIND A LICENSEE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING CODE PROTOCOLS. IT IS TRUE THAT THEY CAN SUSPEND A LICENSE. BUT THIS ONLY OCCURS AFTER AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE GIVEN. THE BEGIN BEEN GIVEN TO THE LICENSEE TO COMPLY. THE LAST I'D HEARD ABC IT CONDUCTED ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS. THOSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS RESULTED IN SOME KIND OF ACTION BY ABC IN ABOUT TWO TO THREE HUNDRED CASES. THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT. THIS MEANS THAT NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF LICENSEES WERE EITHER FOUND TO BE COMPLIED OR AFTER BEING MADE AWARE OF THEIR NON COMPLIANCE. MADE THE CHANGES NECESSARY. TO COMPLY. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THOSE POINT 1% OF CASES UNDER CURRENT LAW ABC IS ONLY ALLOWED TO PURSUE A SUSPENSION. STOOP OF BAY A LAWFUL ORDER THAT MEANS. ABC CANNOT SIMPLY SHOW UP TO A LICENSED PREMISES AND SUSPENDED LICENSE EVEN IF THEY ARE CLEARY VIOLATING THE CURRENT HEALTH ORDER THAT'S OF COURSE OF PROCESS. IF A LICENSEE OBSERVED TO BE IN VIOLATION. THE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIES A LICENSEE AND PROVIDES THEM WITH IF OPPORTUNITY COMPLY IF THEY COMPLY THAT TO WORK AGAINST IF THEY DON'T COMPLY ABC. I CAN THEN TAKE ACTION THIS USUALLY MEANS LICENCES PLACED ON THE FIFTEEN DAY PROBATIONARY PERIOD DURING THIS PERIOD THE LICENSEE IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO SERVE ALCOHOL AS LONG AS THEY COMPLY IF THEY DON'T THEY COULD FACE A FIFTEEN DAY SUSPENSION. IF IT REACHES THIS STAGE A LICENSEE COMPARE FIVE INSTEAD OF SERVING THAT SUSPENSION IF THEY CHOOSE TO SERVE THE SUSPENSION THEY CAN STILL CONTINUE TO SERVE FOOD OR NON ALCOHOLIC DRINKS. IF THE LICENSEE STILL FAILS TO COMPLY ABC COULD DO IT EVEN LONGER SUSPENSION OR EVEN REMOVE REMOVED TO REVOKE THE LICENSE BUT AGAIN THIS WILL ONLY OCCUR IF THE LICENSEE WILLFULLY REFUSES TO FOLLOW THE HEALTH ORDER. I'D MENTION ALL THIS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ISNO SUCH THING AS ABC SUSPENDING A LICENSE TO IS COMPLIANT THEIR LICENSES ONLY SUSPENDED AFTER THE LICENSEE HAS WILLFULLY TIME AND AGAIN REFUSED TO FOLLOW COBIT HELPED ORDERS. I UNDERSTAND IN IN THE SUPPORTER OF MALL BUSINESS I SPOKEN NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS FLOOR- IN ORDER TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS. A OF THE I UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT THIS IS THE TO OUR- IN THE PORTS A CAT ALPHA LIGHTS. BUT I DON'T WITH MEMBERS THE SENATE A NUMBER OF BILLS THE SEEK TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HELP TO THESE BUSINESSES. HOWEVER I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY CONSIDER THE NINETY NINE POINT DOING THEIR PART IN COMPLYING WITH THE HEALTH ORDER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY AGREE WITH IT OR NOT. I THINK THIS BILL IS UNFAIR TO THEM AND PLACES THEM AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE AND I CANNOT SUPPORT THAT. I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE AYE WE DOES ABOUT THESE EVENTS BUT IS THE CHAIR OF GEO I THINK THE CURRENT LAW ALREADY PROVIDES FOR MORE THAN ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY. FOR LICENSES- LICENSEES TO COMPLY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU- CENTER PAM. THANK YOU A THIS CHAIR- I TO. PLUS STAFF SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS. AND- I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE DATA. WE HAVE EVENTUALLY HAD ALMOST SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DIED OF THIS DISEASE. THIS IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IT SPREADS IT SPREADS QUICKLY IF NOT LIMITED. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THOSE PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS ARE NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE THAT NOT ONLY IS COURSE KILLED SO MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO IS ALSO HOSPITALIZED OR INJURED MANY OTHERS. AND FRANKLY- BUSINESS WILL BE DOWN IN RESTAURANTS. WHEN THE DIZZY WHEN THE VIRUS SPREADS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO GO OUTSIDE RIGHTFULLY. AND I THINK IF WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO- BUSINESSES WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL- WOULD ALLOW THAT ONE POINT 1% AND I'VE YOU KNOW FRACTION OF A PERCENT- BASICALLY MORE TIME. TO EVENTUALLY SPREAD THE VIRUS EVEN FURTHER- BY CAN TRYING TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS WHEN CLEARLY THERE'S BEEN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO- MAKE CORRECTIONS OR TO ADD TO MEET THE- PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW OUR FIRST ROLES GOVERNMENT'S PUBLIC SAFETY AND YOUR DOES THIS DATA VIRUSES YOU ARE FROM A BULLET TO OUR FROM A FIRE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. THOUGHT THAT I CERTAINLY AM GOING TO BE OPPOSING THIS BILL THANK YOU. THERE BATES. OKAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THESE AMENDMENTS I THINK IT GETS US WHERE WE NEED TO BE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE CERTAINLY HAS DONE TO RESTAURANTS IN PARTICULAR BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- THE AMENDMENTS DO REMOVE THE PIECE ABOUT HAVING TO PROVE A TRANSMISSION OCCURRED ARE BECAUSE A LACK OF IT OF COMPLIANCE SO MY QUESTION IS. ARE YOU TOOK THE AMOUNT OF SO I'M ASSUMING YOU THINK THE BILL WILL STILL BE EFFECTIVE IN PROTECTING OUR BUSINESSES COULD YOU- KIND ELABORATE ON THAT SENATOR MELENDEZ. SURE SURE THANK YOU SENATOR BATES- SO WE DID NARROW THE BILL THAT WAS AND- IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IT WAS. AN ENDEAVOR THAT WE EMBARKED UPON WITH COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS TAILORED IN A WAY THAT MADE SENSE THAT WASN'T. GIVING BUSINESSES THE ABILITY TO JUST SAY WELL I'M NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL DOES IT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CURE ANY MISTAKES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WE HAVE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE A RESTAURANT YOU KNOW DINING OUTDOORS HAS BEEN CITED BECAUSE- THEIR TABLES WERE. ACCORDING TO THE PERSON WHO SHOWED UP FROM THE STATE THERE'S THEIR TABLE WAS HALF INSIDE HALF OUTSIDE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE FINING PEOPLE FOR. FAMILY RECOGNIZED- THAT THE SENATE SENATOR DODD YOU KNOW SPOKE ABOUT WHAT ABC CANNING CAN'T DO. WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS CAN DO AND CANNOT DO AND I THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS IS A WHOLE EFFORT WHERE PEOPLE. CAN BE FINE CAN BE CITED CAN HAVE LICENSES. REVOKED AND IT HAS. TERRIFIED THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY I THINK GIVEN A TIME WHEN WE ARE PASSING BILLS THAT PROVIDE SOME SORT OF RELIEF Y. EITHER EITHER FINANCIAL. OR GRANT OR EXTENDING THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR WHICH YOU CAN COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH C. CHOIR ANYTHING ELSE. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HELP ALL OF THESE BUSINESSES THE ONES THAT WERE MOST HURT. WORDT RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WERE THIS ALLIANCE YOU KNOW ALL THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES WORD WE'RE JUST DECIMATED SO I'M NOT ASKING THAT THE SENATE PASSED A BILL THAT SAYS PEOPLE CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT AND- YOU KNOW THROW THE RULES OUT THE DOOR THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BUILDERS WE'VE- VERY AGGRESSIVELY TAYLOR THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT ONLY APPLIES TO PEOPLE. WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY BEEN DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE ORDERS AND IT ONLY. APPLIES FROM THE TIME THAT THE EMERGENCY ORDER STARTED UNTIL THE TIME AND IT IS NOT IN PERPETUITY SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. I JUST A COMMENT I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF- PUBLIC SAFETY IS THAT THE CONTACT TRACING OUR WORK AND WE KNOW THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT. IN PARTICULAR WITH RESTAURANTS WHO WERE REALLY FOLLOWING TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW. CONTACT TRACING WITH HELPING IN UNTIL WE FIND A WAY TO MAKE THAT REALLY WORK AND IT CERTAINLY REQUIRES. A HUGE ALL LABOR INTENSIVE EFFORT BUT IT IS VITAL I THINK CERTAINLY TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO TO HAPPEN ON THE VIABILITY. OF FOR OUR OF FRONTLINE SERVICE- ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH RESTAURANT INDUSTRY CERTAINLY HAS BEEN ONE SO I WOULD JUST ADD THAT TO THE COMMENTARY. THAT CONTACT TRACING HAS TO BE EFFECTIVE. FOR OUR BUSINESSES REALLY ARE PUNISHED WHEN THEY NEED TO BE THANK. YOU THANK YOU CENTERMAN. THANK YOU MISTER- SO I APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF THIS IS HE STATED- WHICH IS TRYING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO PLAYED BY THE RULES- BUT INADVERTENTLY FAIL TO DO SO AND I THINK THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE OF OUTDOOR DINING THAT WAS INADVERTENTLY PARTLY ENDORSES A SYMPATHETIC ONE. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU IS YOU KNOW WHY IT DOES YOUR BILL NOT HAVE LANGUAGE AROUND INTENT OR NEGLIGENCE- BECAUSE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED NOW. IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU JUST REPEATEDLY AND WILLFULLY FLOUT THE RULES AS LONG AS YOU KIND OF ISSUE A MEA CULPA AT SOME POINT AND CORRECT YOUR ACTIONS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOSE ARE INTENTIONAL VIOLATIONS OR UNINTENTIONAL- THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO THAT SO EIGHT I KNOW YOU TAILORED THIS BUT BUT AS I READ THE LANGUAGE NOW IT STATES THAT. IF THE LICENSEE DEMONSTRATED. THAT CORRECT TAX WAS TAKEN RESPOND TO ANY PRIOR NOTICE. AND THEY'RE OFF THEY GET THEY GET A FREE PASS AND I THINK WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I THINK OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED AS WELL AS IS THE PROBLEM OF THE WILLFUL REPEATED OFFENDER- AND ANYONE IN BUSINESS I'VEHEARD OF IN MY DISTRICT THAT HAS FIVE BEEN FINE. IS A BAR THAT REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO LISTEN TO A LONG FORTUNATE ORTIZ- WAS VISITED THREE TIMES BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN CONSULTED BY LOCAL COUNTY AND STATE OFFICIALS AND STILL REFUSED TO CLOSE IT WOULD HAVE WAS ATTENTION INDOOR NIGHTCLUB WITH NO MASKS AS ONLY AFTER. ONE OF THE MANAGERS LAID HANDS ON A POLICE OFFICER THAT ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AND NOW SENATOR DODD MY COLLEAGUES MENTION. ONLY TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED. BUSINESSES HAVE ANY CORRECT ACTION MAYBE SEASIDE MY QUESTION IS. YEAH WONDER OFTEN DOES YOUR SITUATION ACTUALLY HAPPENED WHERE ABC- IS TAKING AWAY SOMEONE'S LYSONS ARE ISSUING A FINE- BECAUSETHAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HEARING ABOUT I'M HEARING MORE ABOUT THE REPEATED WILLFUL- IN A VIOLATOR. AND TO WHY NOT TRY TO TAILOR THIS FURTHER TO JUST ACCOUNT FOR THOSE WHO INNOCENTLY VIOLATE. THE RULES AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WHO WILLFULLY INTENTIONALLY AND REPEATEDLY VIOLATE THE RULES. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION AND I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE BILL DOES EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING. IT'S- IT IS TAKE SO THAT YOU CAN'T IT DOESN'T APPLY TO SOMEONE WHO IS WILFULLY. FLOUTING THE RULES I MEAN YOU- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SOME BUSINESSES WHO HAVE DONE SO THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW SOME SORT OF PROOF. JUST SAYING WELL I TRIED DOESN'T CUT IT THANKS THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ALLOWABLE IN THIS BILL BUT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THESE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP. IN TRYING TO COMPLY IN TRYING TO KEEP THEIR HEAD ABOVE WATER AND KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED EMPLOYED SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO. LIVE YOU KNOW WITH THE FAMILY MEMBER GOING GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE OR WATCH THEIR DREAMS GO UP IN SMOKE MANY OF WHOM YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY EMPLOYEES. IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO NEED THAT JOB. SO THE BILL IS. NOT IT JUST IT DOESN'T DO WHAT YOU THINK IT DOES IT IS TERRY TAILORED. SO THAT YOU CANNOT GIVE SOMEONE. THE GREEN LIGHT TO FLOUT THE RULES SO THE WAY I READ THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS IS THAT IF I VIOLATE SO LET'S JUST TAKE IT WHEN YOU'RE WITNESSES. SAMPLE YOUR FIRST WITNESS I LOOKED HER UP AND- SHE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED THE LAW NUMEROUS VISITS FROM LONG BEACH LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND- THE GAS WAS ACTUALLY SHUT OFF AN ATTEMPT TO GET HER TO SHUT DOWN THE RESTAURANT AND SHE CONTINUED TO. REFUSE TO CLOSE DOWN. AT INDOOR DINING IS WHAT THE NEW SAYS- AND FINALLY YOU KNOW AND SHE MADE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS IN THE MEDIA. BUT UNDER YOUR LANGUAGE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF IN RESPONSE TO LATEST NOTICE THE PRIOR NOTICE SHE THEN DECIDES TO DEMONSTRATE CORRECTIVE ACTION. SHE GETS A FREE PASS REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT SHE WILLFULLY DEFIED SEVERAL ORDERS- THAT LEAD TO THAT POINT AND I GUESS THAT'S MY CONCERN. WOULD YOUR LANGUAGE COVER SOMEONE LIKE MS TANNER. WHO REPEATEDLY SAID I'M NOT GOING TO FOLLOW THE RULES% BECAUSE I DON'T AGREE WITH THEM- BY FINALLY. THE LAST ONE- OF SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLY WITH THE LAST NAMES LIKE I GET A- BECAUSE TO ME THAT IF THAT'S THE READING AND THAT'S HOW I READ THE LANGUAGE. THAT DOES RAISE THE CONCERNS OF MY SENATOR ABOUT MY FOOT IN MY COLLEAGUE- FROM NAPA REYES. ABOUT PENALIZING BUSINESSES THE NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE COMPLIED THIS. PANDEMIC. AND I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD. MISS THEM YEAH RUSSIAN I'M A MATE MAYBE IT'S JUST A SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENT ON LANGUAGE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WOULD YOUR BILL ALLOW RELIEF FOR YOUR WITNESS THAT YOU THE TESTIFIED. SENATOR MAN I'D I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T COMMUNICATED THIS CLEARLY ENOUGH SO I'M GOING TO READ TO YOU- THE CHANGE IN THE AMENDMENT WHICH SAYS. THAT ONLY A BUSINESS WHICH HAS SUBSTANTIALLY ATTEMPTED TO COMPLY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH BORDERS OR HAS RECEIVED MULTIPLE NOTICES OF CORRECTION AND HAS WORKED TO ADDRESS. ALL OF THESE DEFICIENCIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF FROM LICENSE REVOCATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE TRIED IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY I DON'T WANT TO AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAY. WELL I TRIED BUT YOU YOU NOW YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW THAT YOU FOR INSTANCE. THE RESTAURANT OWNER WHO HAD TABLES. THAT WERE KIND OF HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW HOUSE OUT OF THE INDOOR AND OUTDOOR DINING AREA. OKAY SO. IT'S VERY EASY TO SAY LOOK I MOVED THEM SO THEY'RE COMPLETELY IN THE OUTDOOR DINING AREA. NO HARM NO FOUL NO PENALTY EITHER THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS RETIREMENT IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY ARE THEY'RE WORKING TO CORRECT I AM NOT. SUGGESTING THAT. WE PASS A BILL THAT SAYS NO ONE HAS TO FOLLOW ANY RULES. AND AT ALL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS GO OUT THE WINDOW THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL SAYS I HOPE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO READ THE AMENDMENT. TO SEE THAT'S MY INTENT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS MY READING AMENDMENTS IS IF I GET VISITED EIGHT TIMES AND ON THE EIGHTH TIME I KNOW THE FIRST SEVEN BUT ON A TIME AYE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED. I WILL BE ALLOWED RELIEF UNDER YOUR BILL THAT'S HOW I READ THE BILL PERHAPS I'M- MISTAKEN- I'M GONNA BE OPPOSING THIS RIGHT NOW JUST BECAUSE I. DO THINK IT. INCLUDE TOO MANY BUSINESSES THAT- FLOUTED THE LAW AND WE SEEN EXAMPLES OF EVERY SINGLE PERSON I'VE READ ABOUT. THAT HAS BEEN HAMMERED BY ABC HAS BEEN SOMEONE WHO HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW THESE RULES THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THEM THEY'RE PROBLEMATIC AND I THINK WE'RE NOT EPIDEMIC RIGHT NOW PEOPLE THAT DISAGREE WITH THE LAW AND REFUSED TO FOLLOW IT. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS BODY ESTABLISH AND REINFORCE THE RULE OF LAW. THAT WE DO NOT REWARD THOSE WHO WOULD GO OUT AND SAY RIDE ON THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE LAW BE APPLIED EQUALLY TO EVERYBODY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SEND THE MEN CENTER JONES. IS YOUR MIKE UP FOR A REASON. SAID JONES. YOUR MAKE UP FOR REASON. KELLY ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. LET ME GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE BEFORE I TURN IT BACK. TELL ME SEVEN- THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH I WAS JUST SUNDERLAND'S I KNOW YOU TO BE A BIG SUPPORTER SMALL BUSINESS AND I UNDERSTAND- THE FRUSTRATION BUT LIKE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. WELL I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MANY MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I CURRENTLY LIVE IN A COUNTY THAT'S STILL ON THE LOWEST TIER OF OPENING- AND THEN YOU CAN LOOK IN THE PAPER AND THE NEWS FOR A LOT OF MY BUSINESS IS ALSO WHO DID NOT COMPLY WHO WILLFULLY DID NOT COMPLY WHO WENT ON TV ABOUT HOW THEY WORK AND COMPLY. AND THEN GOT VISITED BY ABC AND- THAT IT WAS VERY WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT THAT- AS I THINK. MANY OF US IN HERE ALSO HEARD FROM BUSINESSES THAT WERE COMPLAINING. OF FEELING VERY FRUSTRATED BY THOSE WHO ARE FLOUTING THE LAW AND PUBLIC HEALTH BORDERS. AND SO WELL. BY WILL YOU MAY HAVE NARROWED THIS. DOWN I JUST I DON'T I CANNOT SUPPORT THE PREMISE THAT IT'S SUPPORT THAT IT. THE IT THAT THAT IS TRYING TO SAY THAT IF IT. HAS BEEN POINTED OUT IF AT THE VERY END THEN YOU SAY OKAY I'M JUST OAK I'M SORRY- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN. SHOW US SOME PLACE THAT HAD A TABLE IN AND OUT. THAT WAS THE ONLY VIOLATION THEY HAD THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME THEY HAD BEEN VISITED AND- THEY WERE COMPLIANCE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE AND THAT THEY WERE. FINE I JUST. DID IT. FEEL WHICH IS THAT YOU PROVIDED DID NOT MAKE THAT THAT POINT ALSO I CAN'T. BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SENATOR OF CHILCOTE. HELLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OR TO ASK A QUESTION- HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES BY OPERATING A BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND TRYING TO STAY IN COMPLIANCE I'M SORRY COULD YOU SAY AGAIN I APOLOGIZE TO YOU NO WORRIES- I'VE SORT OF SPOKEN A LITTLE FASTER COLLEGE EYES. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING BY OPERATING A BUSINESS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND TRYING TO STAY IN COMPLIANCE. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HAVE AND I WOULD IMAGINE EVERYBODY IN HERE. HAS HEARD FROM THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES AND IT HAS BEEN. A REAL CHALLENGE IT IT'S BEEN STRESSFUL. WE HEAR. YOU KNOW SEEN FAMILIES BREAK UP WE HAVE SEEN SUICIDES WE HAVE SEEN. A NUMBER REALLY DEVASTATED IMPACTS RELATED TO THIS PANDEMIC IN RELATED TO PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOODS IF THEY'VE WORKED THEIR WHOLE LIVES. TO BUILD UP SO I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THE CERTAINLY START HOPE NOT IS A STRANGER TO HEARING THOSE TYPES OF STORIES. BUT AGAIN WITH MY BILL YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT- GIVING PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WOULD LIKE. BUT THAT SIMPLY ISN'T WHAT THE BILL DOES AND I ON I WOULD ASK PEOPLE. TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS. THE RULES HAVE CHANGED A LOT. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND SOME LINES RELATING TO WHAT YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO AS A BUSINESS OWNER. AND AS A PAGER THE RULES HAVE CHANGED A LOT- AND IT IS. DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP WITH THE AND TO MAINTAIN YOUR BUSINESS ALL I'M ASKING. IS THAT WE SHOW THE SAME AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE TO THESE TYPES OF BUSINESSES AND WE AS WE HAVE TO OTHERS WHEN WE HAVE PROVIDED FINANCIAL RELIEF OR GRANTS OR- SOME SORT OF RELIEF FROM HAVING TO PLAY FOR A LICENSE. FOR ANYTHING ELSE EVERYBODY IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AND EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO COMPLY BEST THEY CAN'T EVEN KEEP THEIR PATRONS SAFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I JUST LIKE TO COME IN AND- C. JUST LIKE TO COMMENT THAT. I AM A VERY BUSINESS FRIENDLY- SENATOR MY VERY MUCH AN ADVOCATE FOR CONSUMERS AS WELL FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CONSUMERS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS PERSONALLY. HAS FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO ARE UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SO FORTH- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I RESPECT IS BUSINESSES WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY TO MEET THE BED AND HEALTH REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESSES BUT WHAT I ALSO RESPECT IS THE CONSUMER'S ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN THEY WILL PATRONIZE. BUSINESSES THAT MEET OR THEY FEEL MEET THE HEALTH REQUIREMENTS AND CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WHO WILL NOT VISIT- PATRONIZE BUSINESSES THAT DO NOT MEET THOSE RECORDS IT DIDN'T THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY ARE MEETING OUR THE HELP REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE THERE IN PLACE SO I APPRECIATE THAT BY ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANT TO MENTION IS- BOTH FROM A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD PERSPECTIVE AS SOMEONE WHO. UNDERSTANDS THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IS THAT MANY BUSINESSES AND PUBLIC ENTITIES ARE AFRAID TO CONDUCT BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITIES THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE VULNERABILITIES OF BEING THAT SO IN GOOD FAITH- I ACTUALLY RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE BILL I RESPECT CONSUMERS CHOICE OF SUPPORTING BUSINESSES- THAT. FOLLOW OF IT SAFETY PRODUCT. I ALSO WE- THE CONSUMERS. BUT IF THEY DO NOT SEE THE HEALTH WORKERS BEING THAT THEN PERHAPS THE YOU KNOW THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PATRONIZE THIS BUSINESS JUST LIKE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS DO SO. WITH THAT IN MIND- THE GOOD INTENT OF PROTECTING THOSE BUSINESSES ARE ARE. TRYING TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HEALTH. ALSO I'M JUST ONE NOTE THAT I DON'T NOTICE THAT THEY WE HAD A FELLOW COLLEAGUE. MENTION THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE OR BUSINESSES THAT. HAVE MULTIPLE- CHECKUPS OR- PRETTY QUALITY- FAILURES TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW SOMETIMES THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE- BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC WE'RE ALL CONDUCTING BUSINESSES IN UNKNOWN TERRITORY SOME OF THESE PLACES DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE BREAKING- HEALTH REQUIREMENT UNTIL IT IS BEING PART FORTY BUT I DO RESPECT THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ONCE THEY ARE- NOTIFIED. THAT THEY DO IN GOOD ILL AND GOOD FAITH DO WHAT THEY CAN IN ORDER TO REMEDY THOSE THOSE ARE FOR SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER TAKERS ON THE FLOOR AND- MAKES NO HANDS UP LET ME GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW THIS IS BETTER DIFFICULT MARCH. YOUR TIME WITH THIS PANDEMIC AND IT CONTINUES TO BE A DIFFICULT MARCH. BUSINESS OWNERS ISSUE WILL HAVE NOTED IN YOUR COMMENTS OF. STRUGGLE TO COMPLY WITH THE VARIOUS REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THE PANDEMIC OF NINETEEN. REGULATIONS IN AN EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. AND EVER CHANGING TEARS FRANKLY IN THE STATE UP AND DOWN- AS YOU KNOW FROM READING THE BILL I'M SURE THAT THIS BILL. INVOLVES MORE THAN JUST BARS AND RESTAURANTS BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN REGULATED BY THE- BY THE ABC- IT INVOLVES. THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND SINCE YOU'RE SITTING IN THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE YOU KNOW THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED DIFFERENT TYPES OF BUSINESSES AND TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND PROFESSIONS. NOW THE HEALTH CARE. ENTERPRISES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. BUT BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS LEAST IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OR NOT AND THEY'RE PROBABLY MANY OTHERS THAT ARE BURIED IN THAT LIST OF DCA REGULATED. OCCUPATIONS AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE ALSO- NOT EXCLUDED. WE'VE HAD STATE EMPLOYEES WORKING DILIGENTLY UP AND DOWN THE STATE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE RULES THAT WE'VE PUT IN PLACE THE RULES THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PUT IN PLACE THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE STATE AGENCIES HAVE ADOPTED. TO COMPLY WITH THIS PANDEMIC- AND THERE'S NO SHORT SNOW SHORT CITING THAT VERY VERY DILIGENT VERY VERY DEDICATED STATE EMPLOYEES ALSO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS. PANDEMIC I DO WANNA THANK. THE SENATOR AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO NARROW THIS BILL IN THE FAIRLY SHORT TIME. THAT WE HAD TO DO IT REMEMBER THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING FOR THIS BILL AND- IF IT HAPPENS TO MOVE OUT OF HERE WHICH MAY NOT HAPPEN BUT IF IT DOES THERE ARE OTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS- BOTH IN THIS HOUSE AND IN THE HOUSE DOWN THE HALL THAT. WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS BILL- OBVIOUSLY MORE DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HAD ON THE DETAILS AND THE ISSUES TO DEFINE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE AMONG OTHERS IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT FRANKLY COLLEAGUES FROM YOUR COMMENTS ON THE FLOOR WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR THOSE LISTENING IS A IS THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE AND UNFORTUNATELY THE AUTHOR HAS NOT HAD THE TIME THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY SPENT. TO DEFINE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DO YOU GET FIVE BITES AT THE APPLE OR DO YOU GET TO AND IS THE SECOND ONE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE OR IS IT ONE. YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S NOW GOING ON NINE YEARS. I'VE THOUGHT THAT IN MOST CASES NOT ALL. A SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR CALIFORNIA REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY IT IS GENERALLY NOT IT'S- AN I GOTCHA SITUATION IN MANY CASES ON THE ONLY. CONSEQUENCE OF THE GOTCHA IS HOW SEVERE THE PENALTY IS. AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. AND THIS BILL BEGINS TO EMBED SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE IN A REGULATORY SCHEME. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ARGUE AS MANY OF US HAVE ON THE AFFIRMATIVE SIDE. THAT SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD IN SOME AREAS OF BUSINESS REGULATION WHETHER IT'S WAGING OUR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH OR ANYTHING ELSE. BUT NOT OTHERS. NOW OBVIOUSLY YOU OUR ENTITLED TO VOTE YOUR CONSCIENCE AND VOTE THE WAY YOU READ THIS BILL AND THAT'S THE WAY I AM IS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE WAY I'VE BEEN AS A CHAIR OF ANY OTHER COMMITTEE THAT I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HOLDING IN THE EIGHT PLUS YEARS I'VE- BEEN HERE. THIS BILL NEEDS MORE WORK. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WILLING TO PUT INTHE WORK AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT BETTER. GOOD FOR THOSE THAT DON'T SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT THAT'S FINE TOO. BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. BUT TODAY WITH MY IPHONE. SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WORDS ON THE BILL AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO MAKING CHANGES AND AS YOU INDICATED- THE THIS BILL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HEARD DURING OUR LAST COMMITTEE HEARING I PULLED IT. SO THAT WE CAN REALLY DRILL DOWN AND WORK ON THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT WHICH I BELIEVE WE DID BUT OF COURSE AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WE MAY NEED TO REFINE IT. MORE WHICH I'M WILLING TO DO AND I AM CERTAINLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THE OTHER SENATORS WHO MAYBE MEMBERS OF THESE OTHER COMMITTEES. SO THAT WE CAN REFINANCE MORE AM NOT OPPOSED TO THAT IF I WERE I WOULDN'T HAVE PULLED THE BILL. IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AS WELL THAT. THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT TAKING- COVETED SERIOUSLY IN TAKING THAT THE- TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS SERIOUSLY. AND I THINK WE ALL DO THAT BUT I THINK WE ALL. ALSO KNOW THAT THE CDC HAS ALREADY DONE THEIR STUDY AND INDICATED. THAT SOMEONES IN RESTAURANTS AND BARS WERE NOT AFFECT THE LARGEST VECTORS. AT THE TRANSMISSIONS OF THE VIRUS AND FRANKLY IT WAS REALLY. PRIVATE GATHERINGS THAT WERE THE LARGEST PROBLEM NOT THE TYPES OF. BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER REFINE THIS BILL AND WORK WITH YOU. ON THIS ISSUE SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE DON'T SEE EVEN MORE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR LIVELIHOODS GO UP IN SMOKE AND THEN HAVE TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYEES. THEY NO LONGER HAVE A JOB- EITHER IN WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SODO WE A MOTOR. ON THIS BILL S. B. ONE OF ONE ZERO TWO. USING.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- PLEASE TO PRESENT SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR AND LET ME START WHICH INDICATING THAT I AM ACCEPTING BOTH AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS- BUT I WOULD LIKE YOUR PERMISSION TO ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE AS WE HAVEN'T LANDED YET A LANGUAGE THAT FULLY WORKS AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT THE STAFF AND THE CHAIR OF DONE SO FAR. IN- THIS BILL. SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS. GIVE FOLKS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE. THEIR PHARMACY. AND YOU'D THINK THAT RIGHT NOW PEOPLEHAVE THAT RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES PATIENTS ARE STEERED AWAY FROM THEIR CHOSEN PHARMACY WHEN A PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER. INFORMS THEM THAT THEY MUST FILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS AT A PARTICULAR PHARMACY. OR PAY OUT OF POCKET. NO THE BILL DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU WOULD NECESSARILY HAVE YOUR FULL COSTS COVERED IF YOU GO OUT OF NETWORK YOU KNOW. THE PHARMACY WOULD STILL NEED TO BE IN NETWORK BUT THE PATIENT WOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE PHARMACY OF THEIR PREFERENCE. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS THAT. VERY OFTEN. EIGHT A PATIENT HAS A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARTICULAR PHARMACIST AND THAT PHARMACY HAD KNOWS THAT PERSON'S MEDICAL HISTORY MAYBE THERE'S CULTURAL SENSITIVITIES MAYBE THERE'S A LANGUAGE ISSUES. AND WHEN YOU CAN NOT CHOOSE THE PHARMACY THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE YOUR PRESCRIPTION FILLED IN YOUR STEERED TO ONE BY A PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER YOU LOSE THOSE BENEFITS ADDITIONALLY. THE PHARMACY THAT YOU'RE STEER TO MAYBE FAR AWAY FROM WHERE YOU LIVE. AND THERE MAY BE OTHER ISSUES SO WHAT SB FIFTY FIVE TWO FOUR DOES HIS PROHIBITS PATIENTS FROM BEING REQUIRED TO GO TO A PARTICULAR PHARMACY WHEN THERE'S NO CLINICAL REASON THAT THEY MUST DO SO. AND ENSURES THAT PATIENTS CAN ACCESS WHICH EVER PHARMACY THEY PREFER WITHIN THEIR NETWORK- AND WITH THAT IT WOULD ALLOW MY- SPEAK AND I HAVE JIM GROSS FROM THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION. AND CRAIG PULSIPHER FROM AP LA HEALTH WHICH IS A- HEALTH CENTER AN ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION SERVING HIV PATIENTS IN LOS ANGELES GENTLEMAN YOU MAY PROCEED PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF OUR TIME LIMITATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER TEACHES JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION AS A SENATOR INDICATED THE PURPOSES OF SB FIVE TO FOUR. IT'S BEEN HEALTH INSURERS PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER CONGLOMERATES FROM DENYING PATIENTS A CHOICE OF PHARMACY ISSUES FOR FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS AND RECEIVING SERVICES. THESE CONGLOMERATES OF STEERING PATIENTS AWAY FROM FARMERS USE THAT PATIENTS ARE CONTRACTUALLY ENTITLED THE USE IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS THEY CLAIM THEY'RE SAVING MONEY BUT UNLESS THE PATIENT DIRECTLY RECEIVES A FINANCIAL BENEFIT. BY USING THE CONGLOMERATE'S MAIL ORDER OR CHAIN PHARMACY THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PATIENT BENEFITS FROM THIS. CLARIFICATION IS DENIED CHOICE THE PHARMACY HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE CONGLOMERATE THE PATIENT'S ENTITLED TO SEE THE PHARMACY. AND SHOULD NOT BE DENIED THE RIGHT ABSENT IN THE STABBINGS CLINICAL LOGISTICAL REASON. IF THE GLAMOUR WHICH IS TO FINANCIALLY INCENTIVIZE PATIENTS USE PHARMACY THE AMENDMENT IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS ALLOWS OUT. THE BILL ALSO IN SIENA COMPETITIVE PRACTICE OF ALLOWING THESE CONGLOMERATES THE ABILITY TO DESIGN A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT OFFERED TO SHOP THE CURRENT PLAYERS THAT ONLY OFFERS THE CONGLOMERATE'S PHARMACIES AS AUTHORIZED PHARMACIES FOR AN- INSURER SHE YOU.

WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO SB FIVE TWENTY FOUR- WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS- FROM PCA. THE BILL USUALLY IN ITS CURRENT FORM DEFINES PATIENTS STEERING IN A WAY THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED VERTICALLY INTEGRATED HEALTH MODELS STEVEN COLORS MONEY AND CONSUMERS MONEY FOR THAT MATTER IN SOME HEALTH PLANS ARE ARE PART OF THOSE INTEGRATED MODELS- YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE INTERESTED IN THE DATA THAT SUPPORTERS ARE RELYING ON SHOW THAT THESE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS RESTRICT PATIENT CHOICE- WHEN- YOU KNOW THE DATA THAT WE HAVE. SHOWN THE OPPOSITE- IN STUDIES OF THOSE SYSTEMS BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND THAT THESE- INTEGRATED. MODELS CAN LOWER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS- SO WE CAN GET WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS ARE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE. THE RIGHT PRICE POINT TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES- NOW HAVING SAID THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AMENDMENTS ARE IN THE WORK AND- WILL CERTAINLY ANALYZE THOSE ONES- THE AUTHOR- ON LAND ON THE LANGUAGE- AND MOVE FORWARD ACCORDINGLY ONCE WE HAVE HAD A TIME. TO REVIEW THOSE AMENDMENTS- BUT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME- WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S SERVING. SEE IF THEY'RE ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY THERE ARE NO WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION LET'S MOVE TO ROOM ONE TWELVE THE C. WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION THERE SITTING NO WITNESSES LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCING OF THIS MISTER MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT.

BUT NOW GOING GO TO MINE EIGHTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN LINGER ON BEHALF OF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ALSO RESPECTFULLY APPROACHED. NEXT NOW GO TO LINE. THIRTY SEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE TREAT THE START WITH KAISER PERMANENTE HEY WE ARE CURRENTLY IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD THUS FAR I WITH THE AUTHOR THAT THE DOCTOR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF- TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS WE BELIEVE WE CAN FINALIZE RESOLUTION ON THAT VERY SOON BUT AT THE TIME WE REMAIN OPPOSED APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. NECKLINE BUT WHEN THE NINE. YES GOOD MORNING PRESS TWO YOUNG FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. NEXT MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THAT SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU. CENTER BEFORE I FORGET TO I MAY HAVE NOT A MAYBE I DIDN'T HEAR IT DID YOU ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ANALYSIS YES THANK YOU TERRY OPEN TO MY COMMENTS WITH- ACCEPTING BOTH AMENDMENTS HOWEVER ASKING YOUR PERMISSION. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO DAWN THE LANGUAGE FOR THE SECOND ONE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. THERE LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER TECH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I HAVE RECEIVED THOSE LETTERS IN THE PAST TRYING TO STEER ME TO A DIFFERENT PHARMACY AND I THINK AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR THERE ARE PEOPLE BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PHARMACISTS AND IF THEY CHOOSE TO CHANGE PHARMACIES THAT SHOULD BE THE PATIENTS CHOICE NOT THEIR PBMS CHOICE SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND MOVE IT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK CENTER LEVENS THERE NEWMAN. HE MATURES I WOULD AGREE THAT- PATIENTS IN MANY INSTANCES- IS A PROBLEMATIC THING LIKE I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- A COUPLE OF THE WITNESSES PROPOSED INCLUDING MR LEWIS HAVE NOTED. THAT MANY HEALTHCARE PLANS ACTUALLY DO ENJOY SAVINGS- PARTICULAR ON MAINTENANCE DRUGS WHERE THERE PROBABLY ISN'T A NEED FOR A DAY DIRECT PHARMACIST PATIENT CONSULTATIONS. I TRY NOT CLEAR ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE GOT- THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THE FUTURE- BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE'S SOME MIDDLE GROUND THERE- FOR A FAIRLY NARROW USE CASE. WHERE IF YOU HAVE ANY TO DESCRIBE AND IF YOU CAN PROVE OR IF THERE'S SOME INSURANCE- THAT THE CUSTOMER FOR PATIENTS RECEIVING THE BEST PRICE- BUT THAT WOULD STILL BE ACCEPTABLE SO IF YOU. COULD SPEAK TO THAT I'D BE GRATEFUL- WITH THROUGH THE CHAIR. YES PLEASE- THANK YOU FOR THE- SO THERE'S- FIVE THERE. NOT ONLY THE BILL'S CONSTRUCTED BUT ALSO WITH THE AMENDMENTS THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT SAY THE- PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER. FROM DISCOUNTING FROM YOU KNOW COMMUTE CLEARLY COMMUNICATING TO THE CONSUMER THAT- PHARMACY X. WOULD GIVE THE PRESCRIPTION AT A LOWER PRICE THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THAT. IT JUST PROHIBITS INDICATING THAT YOU COULD ONLY USE THAT PHARMACY SO IF THE PATIENT CHOOSES FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE TO YOU KNOW PAY A HIGHER COPAY OR PAVE FURTHER OUT OF POCKET. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW IT BUT IT DOES NOT LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR DEAN BENEFITS MANAGER TO NEGOTIATE A DIFFERENT PRICE WITH THEIR PREFERRED AND AGAIN YOU JUST WENT THERE SO THAT THE UNIT IS JUST AFFECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPT IN AND OPT OUT THEN- WHERE THE- THE PATIENT. WOULD HAVE TO FIRMLY OPT IN TO A PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO WEAR THE HEALTH PLAN COULD GIVE THEM THE OPTION OF OPTING OUT WELL IT'S NOT SO MUCH OPT IN OR OPT OUT RIGHT NOW CERTAIN OF THESE BENEFITS MANAGERS ARE BASICALLY. COMMUNICATE TO THE PATIENTS THAT YOU HAVE NO CHOICE YOU CAN ONLY USE PHARMACY X. AND SO WHAT THIS WOULD ALLOW IS THAT YOU COULD USE WHICHEVER PHARMACY YOU CHOOSE WITHIN THAT NETWORK. THE PATIENT BENEFIT MANAGER THE PRESCRIPTION THAT MAKES COMMUNICATE THAT THERE'S THIS ADVANTAGE TO X. OR Y. AND THEN YOU COULD CHOOSE TO DO THAT IF YOU CHOSE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUT YOU WOULD NOT BE FORCED TO. SHOW ACTION ISSUE RIGHT I DO APPRECIATE IT ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECTS OF OUR INSURANCE COULD SYSTEM AS IT EXISTS IS THE- PICK THE OPACITY OF PAYMENT. RIGHT SO ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL CUSTOMERS OR PATIENTS TO MAKE DECISIONS- THAT OFTEN- WILL NOT BE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD. THE LEVERAGE OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS TO PRODUCE TRêN- BUT IT IS TRUE. THAT THERE PROBABLY ARE ALL BEING EQUAL A CLUB- CHIU FOR DELIVERING SHOULD THE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ONE IS. CHEAPER AND SO I WOULD MAKE SURE. LEAST HAVE INSURANCE- THAT WE DON'T FOR GO THAT POSSIBILITY AS PART OF THIS BILL. FROM THE INTEREST THING ABOUT THIS AS WELL WELL SOMEBODY OPPOSITION MIGHT CLAIM. THAT THERE. THAT THE ARE STEERING. TO A PARTICULAR CHAIN FOR EXAMPLE LIKE SHE SHE SAID AS AN EXAMPLE. IT IS BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO GREATLY REDUCE COSTS AND THUS BE LESS BURDEN ON ALL OF US SINCE ALL OF US IN FACT- INSURANCE IS A IS A POOL. SO ALL OF A SHARE IN THE COST THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT IN FACT ANY OF THEIR STEERING HAS REDUCED ALL OF OUR COSTS AND WHAT IN FACT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT VERY OFTEN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER IS STEERING. TO THE CLUSTER PHARMACIES THAT IS PHONE THAT THE IN OTHER WORDS THE ENTITY. THAT OPERATES PHARMACIES ALSO OWNS THE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGER. VERY BAD AND YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT- THOSE PREMIUMS ARE OPERATE MAIL ORDER FACILITIES COULD PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SOME FASHION AT THE GIVING THE CUSTOMER THE CHEAPEST PRICE AT THE END THROUGH THAT HEALTH PLAN SAVING. ALL OF US MONEY AND SO AGAIN MY HOPE IS THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T ELIMINATE THAT POSSIBILITY FOR LEGISLATION I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT WANT TO PRECLUDE THAT AND- CERTAINLY THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW WE CONTROL COSTS WITHIN. OUR HEALTH- DELIVERY SYSTEM IN OUR INSURANCE IS SEPARATE FROM THIS BILL WELL I THINK THE OPPOSITION'S CLOUDING THE ISSUE BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING SPECIFIC IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD EITHER GUARANTEE A REDUCED COST. OR PREVENT. THANK YOU CENTER CHIPS KENNARD THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SIR NEWMAN SIR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CENTER. I HAVE A QUESTION I LIKE TO SPELL ON I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT- AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO MIGHT BE SELF INSURED AND THEN USE A PBM FOR COST SAVINGS WHEN I WAS IN A STOCKTON CITY COUNCIL USED ONE AND I USED A SMALL MOM AND POP PHARMACY THAT IS SADLY NOW GONE OUT OF BUSINESS BUT IT IT- IT IT JUST DID MAIL ORDER OR JUST SOME OF THE BIG CHANGE AN ARGUMENT WAS FOR A COST SAVINGS BECAUSE OF COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE. ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR ROLES IN AND BE USING PBMS. SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AMONG THE EMPLOYERS THAT USE PBMS. AND THIS AGAIN WOULD- NOT PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. AND IT WOULD STILL ALLOW THE PBM TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PATIENT WHAT A PREFERRED PHARMACY IS OR WHAT A FARM A PHARMACY THAT MIGHT GIVE THEM A DISCOUNT. FOR EXAMPLE. IN THIS ALSO WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO USE A PHARMACY WITHIN A NETWORK. SO IT IT ISN'T THAT YOU WOULD GET TO YOU KNOW COMPLETELY GO OUT OF NETWORK AND EXPECT. YOUR INSURER TO COVER THAT COST- SO IT. IT IN A WAY IT'S KIND OF A HYBRID IN THAT. IT WOULD IT JUST. PREVENTS THE PBM FROM. SPECIFYING THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE PHARMACY X. SEARCH LOCAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD AND PERSONS HERE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AND MAKE THIS WORK- BILL WORKABLE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. IT APPEARS FROM THE DISCUSSIONS TODAY THAT- AND FROM THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED THAT YOUR GOAL IS NOT TO PREVENT. THE TBMS FROM SETTING UP THESE PREFERRED NETWORKS AND A COST SAVING OPTION FOR CONSUMERS SO LONG AS IT IS AN OPTION NOT A REGULAR REQUIREMENTS IS THIS CORRECT. THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING- IF YOU DON'T MIND WHY DON'T YOU ASK THEM- YOUR SET OF QUESTIONS AND THEN IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I. FUEL LESS- THAT I MIGHT CONFUSE IN TERMS OF ANSWERING I COULD ASK JIM GROSS TOO- TO CLARIFY ADDITION. AND THEN- SO ARE WE DID YOU I'M SORRY I THOUGHT IF YOU WOULD LIST YOUR QUESTIONS THEN I CAN SEE- I HAVE THE ABILITY TO ANSWER THEM ALL OR WHETHER I WOULD LIKE JIM GROSS TO ALSO JOIN I UNDERSTAND- IS THAT ALSO YOUR GOAL TO ALLOW THE PBMC COMMUNICATE TO CONSUMERS THE SAVINGS THAT MIGHT COME ALONG. WITH USING PREFERRED NETWORKS. AND LASTLY- I JUST WANT TO COMMEND AND PERSONAL LEVEL THE FACT THAT THIS IS JUST GIVING CONSUMERS OPTIONS FOR SOMEONE WHO'S AN ADVOCATE FOR GIVING CONSUMERS OPTIONS AND CHOICES I TRULY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND INTENT. OF THE BILL IN THAT EFFORT. THANK YOU- IT. IT THE INTENT IS AS I INDICATED BEFORE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THAT THE ABILITY FOR THE PATIENT OF CHOICE BUT IT DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE BENEFIT MANAGER FROM COMMUNICATING WHERE THERE MAY BE A DISCOUNT INVOLVED BUT ALLOW ME TO HAVE- JIM GROSS ADD. TO ANSWERS TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISED IN CASE I HAVE NOT BEEN IS COMPLETE. IS THAT- OKAY SHARE. YES MISTER GROSS. HOPEFULLY HE'S STILL ON THE LINE MR GROCERY USED TO ONLINE THE- WE AT LEAST GET INTO WE DO BELIEVE DOES GIVE THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS THE ABILITY TO ONE APPLE FOR NETWORKS BUT NOT ONE. THAT ONLY INVOLVE THOSE IN- PHARMACIES AND MAIL ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAVE TOTAL OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL SECOND- WITH RESPECT TO THE STEERING INTO SPECIFICALLY THE AMENDMENT THAT THE SENATOR CLOCK AND OUR INTENTION IS TO ALLOW AND EVEN. TECHNOLOGY APPROPRIATENESS OF OFFERING DISCOUNTS AND OTHER BENEFITS TO ENTICE THE PATIENT TO GO TO A PARTICULAR PHARMACY AND SO WITH A MAIL ORDER PHARMACY- WILL OFFER A LOWER COPAY OR SOMETHING THAT DIRECTLY- DRIVE STREET THE PATIENTS BENEFIT THAT IS PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE NOT ONLY THAT PART BECAUSE THEY CAN LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS. BUT THESE MANDATORY NETWORKS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE THAT AND THE STEERING THAT TAKE YOU AWAY FROM A PHARMACY THAT YOU USE WITHOUT RESPECT TO WHETHER THERE'S ANY DIRECT FINANCIAL BENEFIT THAT AS. WITH THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO PROHIBIT. SO WITH COMMITMENT- I WILL BE SERV THE BILL TO. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE BILL IMPROVE BY THE TIME HE GETS THE FLOOR ROAD RESERVE MY ABILITY TO BE CONSERVE MY BOAT. THANK YOU SENATOR STINNER THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER BACKER. I WOULD THINK THE AUTHORS WILL INTEREST A I'M I AM. PRO CHOICE IN THIS MATTER AND I APPRECIATE THAT- HER BRING THIS UP IN AND GIVING. FOLKS THAT CHOICE AND AGAIN AS WE WERE CLEAR. IT DOESN'T RESTRICT ANYONE'S ABILITY TO- TO OFFER BENEFITS TO FOLKS- THAT THEY CHOOSE TO OFFER- DISCOUNTS TO. DID YOU DISCUSS KAISER AND HOW KAISER FALLS INTO THIS. LET ME HAVE A JIM GROSS RESPONDED THAT. GROSS YES AND I THINK IT GETS KAISER INDICATED WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS- COMMITTEE ON SUCH AS YOU KNOW CONTROVERSIAL. INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHEN YOU SIGNED UP FOR KAISER YOU AGREE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE THEIR HOSPITAL. AND THEIR- AFFILIATED PROVIDER NETWORK AND SO THAT IS A CONSUMER CHOICE RIGHT UP WITH ONE ABOUT BEING WITHIN A AS WE CALL IT A CLOSED NETWORK THAT IS NOT THE CASE WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR A HEALTH PLAN AND LATER TO FIND OUT. THEY'RE BEING OR THERE'S RUNNING ARE PROBABLY BUT YOU WERE NOT TOLD AND WE'RE NOT HARD- YOU. WERE YOUR OWN CHOICE AND SO I WAS USING DIFFERENT ANIMAL IN THAT REGARD WE BELIEVE- BECAUSE OF THE WAR UNDERSTANDING OF BEING PART OF A FULLY INTEGRATED NETWORK. NOT BE PROHIBITED IN THAT REGARD WE NEED TO WORK OUT AMENDMENTS WITH KAISER ALONG THOSE LINES. THANK YOU THANK YOU- THE OFFICER BAKER THANK YOU CENTER DIED. YES I BELIEVE THAT- SERVER NEWMAN'S QUESTIONS ANSWERED A LOT OF MIND I CONTINUE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED JUST BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY BARRAGED WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT PRESCRIPTION PRICING AND SO YOU HAVE NOW WE HAVE PLANS FOR COUNTIES PERHAPS OUR STATE. THAT ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO CONTROL COSTS AND HERE WE ARE. PUTTING UP SOME LIMITATIONS TO THAT THAT SAID WOULD YOU LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY OF THOSE SITES AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN BMP YOU CAN FIVE ROOM ON BOTH SIDES TO. REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF- THE TESTIMONY AGAIN ON BOTH SIDES. IF THERE EVER IS AN AUTHOR IN THE SENATE THE BUT I BILL WILL- BE A WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES IT'S SKINNER AND ALSO BUILD. THANK YOU FOR CALLING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR- WAITED FOR DON'T CALL YOU SAYING CENTER SKINNER YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU. ARMED I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IN THE AND I ALSO IF IT SHEARER THE OF. OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS IN PRESCRIPTION PRICES ESPECIALLY WHAT I FIND VERY INTERESTING IS THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS. IS A REAL SHRINKING OF A PHARMACY AVAILABILITY WELL THERE THERE'S A LOT OF PHARMACIES THEY ARE PRIMARILY THE INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES. HAVE ALMOST DISAPPEARED. NOW THE WEATHER IN THE LOSS OF INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES AS AFFECTED PRESCRIPTION COSTS OR NOT I CAN'T BY DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE BUT CERTAINLY THE CONSOLIDATION OF PHARMACIES TO BEING THOSE PHARMACIES THAT ARE THEN OWNED. THAT THE FOR THE OWNERS OF THE PHARMACIES ALSO OWNED THE PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS MANAGERS DOES NOT SEEM TO BENEFIT US IN TERMS OF PRESCRIPTION COST NOW THAT TO ME PROBABLY IS A DIFFERENT SET OF LEGISLATION. THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO LOOK AT AND WHETHER EVEN THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO. TO- MODIFY YOUR INFLUENCE THOSE COSTS- AGAIN I THAT IS NOT MY EXPERTISE BUT I CERTAINLY FIND IT VERY INTERESTING THAT ENTITIES LIKE THE CHAMBER. WOULD OPPOSE SUCH A BILL WHICH BASICALLY MY BILL SUPPORTS BUSINESS. BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR ANY BUSINESS THAT IS WITH ANY PHARMACY BUSINESS THAT IS WITHIN THE NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO BE UTILIZED. AND NOT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS MANAGER DIRECTION YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE- INTERESTINGLY- I GREW UP WORKING FOR AN INDEPENDENT PHARMACY MY FATHER WAS INDEPENDENT PHARMACIST. HIS BUSINESS HE HAS PASSED PEAS- PASSED AWAY IN THE EARLY NINETIES HOWEVER HIS BUSINESS STILL HAS HIS NAME ON IT IS STILL OPERATED BY A FAMILY THAT EXISTS TODAY. NOW HOW THEY HAVE EXISTED ALL THESE YEARS IS PARTLY DUE TO THE FACT OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THAT PHARMACY PROVIDED AND THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PATIENTS. AND PEOPLE PREFER ED CHOOSING TO GO THERE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WAS REGARD IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY WERE STEERED. ARM NOW THIS BILL WAS NOT WRITTEN TO BENEFIT ONLY OR SOLELY INDEPENDENT PHARMACIES THERE'S TOO FEW HAVE TO HAVE TO REALLY CARRY A BILL FOR THAT PURPOSE BUT IT CERTAINLY ALLOWS FOR. THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER IT'S CULTURAL WHETHER IT'S PRIVACY WHETHER IT'S LANGUAGE WHETHER IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PHARMACIST FOR WHATEVER REASON BE ABLE TO HELP THEIR PRESCRIPTION FILLED WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO. A PHARMACY WITHIN THEIR NETWORK AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THIS BILL SENATE BILL FIVE TWO FOUR. THURMOND DOES MOVE THE BILL.

A COURT REPORTER IN CHARGE WHO IS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT REPORTING BOARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEOUT OF STATE COURT REPORTERS IT HERE TO CALIFORNIA STANDARDS THAT'S POINT ONE POINT TWO IS WITH RESPECT TO OF WITNESSES TESTIFYING REMOTELY AS THE CHAIR IS AWARE- SOMETIMES THEIR MINISTER WITNESSES IT APPEARED TRIAL FOR EXAMPLE CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS IN THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT HAVE BOTH PARTY STIPULATE YOUR RESPECTIVE OF THE JUDGE'S DECISION IF BOTH PARTIES STIPULATE TO WITNESS TESTIFYING REMOTELY THEY MAY DO SO. THE END OF ONE PARTY WISHES TO HAVE A WITNESS TESTIFIED REMOTELY AND THE OTHER PARTY OBJECTS THEN THE JUDGE HAS CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT- SHE SHOULD USE TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WITH THIS MAY TESTIFY REMOTELY- IT WILL CREATE EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCE EXPENSE ORIGINAL VOTE ALSO WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN. SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS- IS.

WHETHER THEY SIX FOR THOSE SERVICES THROUGH A LICENSEE OWNED FIRM OR CORPORATION NOT OWNED BY A LICENSEE. IT'S THAT SIMPLE IT'S ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION. REPORTERS TRANSCRIPT IS AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT BEFORE DURING AND AFTER TRIAL CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE LEADERS HAVE PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED LAWS TO INCLUDE DETAILS AND SPECIFICITY ON EXACTLY HOW THE RECORD SHOULD BE HANDLED.

NO MATTER WHERE THEIR HOME STATE IS LOCATED SB TWO FORTY ONE ALLOWS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO KNOW THEY HAD SOMEONE TO TURN TO NAMELY THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD SHOULD THEY EXPERIENCE ON ETHICAL AND LEGAL BEHAVIOR BY A COURT REPORTER FOR A COURT REPORTING FIRM. THE WELCOME DIVERSE IS. BECAUSE COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER ITS FIRST HEALTHY BUSINESS. RAISES THE QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE LOWERS PRICES AND EXPAND ACCESS TO GOODS AND SERVICES.

CASH GOOD MORNING MISS CARE AND MEMBER LED BAND ON BEHALF OF S. YOU HELLO. REPRESENTING COURT REPORTERS WORKING INCOME COURTS THE AND TO AT EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE- THE QUESTION THAT YOU DISCLOSE THE QUICKNESS IS ON THE TELEPHONE HAVE SHOWN ANY MORE CLEARLY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY MY COURT REPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC I'VE HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN HEARING THE SANCTITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE OFFICIAL RECORD. BY WHICH THEY ARE TASKED TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR FULL RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW PARTICULARLY AND MANY RELATE TO THEIR RIGHT TO APPEAL WITHOUT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING OFTEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING WILL HAVE GARBLED COMMUNICATION LINES WILL DROP FACT ACROSS. HIS BIRTH ARE EXPONENTIALLY EXACERBATED SICK. BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOT IN OUR SYSTEM WE STRONGLY URGE THE COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO HOLD OFF UNTIL THE END OF THE BARGAIN THAT MAKE AND THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXACT EMERGENCY ORDER ENSURE THAT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH MODERNIZING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IF. YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. MISTER NO ELSE IS THE THEY WISH TO SPEAK FOR LET'S BRING THAT THE BACK TO MIKE. IN THE CHAIN. CALL ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. CENTER NEWMAN FOLLOWED BY CENTER BACK. THANK YOU MISTER ISSUE SENATOR BYRD IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. A RESPONDING TO THE LAST WITNESS FROM YEAR YOU. WOULD BE GRATEFUL. FOR BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE. IMPORTANT CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED ON ONE FOR THE CONCERN IS COST AND- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE A DEFENDANT UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION. THAT YOU BE ABLE TO PRESNT A DEFENSE WITHOUT IF THERE'S GOING TO BE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY USED WITHOUT REGARD TO COST NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY BEING USED IN THE COURT- TO THE EXTENT THAT. A LAWYER. IS A PROPONENT OF EITHER A WITNESS OR EVIDENCE AND THAT TECHNOLOGY FAILS THEN. IT'S THE LAWYER WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT HE OR SHE HAS AN ACCURATE RECORD THE LAWYER WHO'S RESPONSIBLE MAKE SURE THAT EVIDENCE COMES IN SO USING THE EXAMPLE BECAUSE STARTING A RECORDS STILL NEAR RECORD IS REALLY A MINISTERIAL WITNESS. ALL OFTEN THE STIPULATIONS BUT SOMETIMES NOT CAN TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME TO GO THROUGH RECORDS AND AUTHENTICATE THEM. IF THE TECHNOLOGY FAILS AND YOU DECIDE YOU'RE GOING TO USE REMOTE ACCESS TO PROVIDE THAT. THAT TESTIMONY AND YOUR RECORDS DON'T COME IN THEN YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM THE NEAR SIDE. IS A IS AT A LOSS AND YOU REALLY CAN'T ASK FOR A CONTINUANCE SO YOU CAN BRING THAT WITH THIS IN A LIVE. OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RESORT TO SOME OTHER METHOD OF APPROVAL. BUT ARE SIMPLY SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE TECHNOLOGY FOR SOMETHING AGAIN LIKE A MINISTER A WITNESS- THAT THAT. IT IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT CREATE EFFICIENCIES IN THE COURT IN FACT IT IS COUNTER. OUR EFFORT CREATE A FISHING SEES- AND THE CROSSINGSIN THE COURTS. I APPRECIATE THAT HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND. TO HER LAST POINT- EGGMAN CASE TO PURPOSES YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RUSH WHY NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES RESULT. OF I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY REASON TO WAIT AGAIN IF YOU'RE COUNCIL AND YOU'RE GOING TO RELY ON A REMOTE MASTERED TO. INTRODUCE EVIDENCE AND IT FAILS THEN YOU'VE GOT TO RESORT TO AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD I THINK BY AND LARGE IT'S WORK FINE I'M SURE THRE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT DIDN'T WORK FINE WHEN YOU'VE HAD TO EITHER. DELAY OR YOU HAD TO BRING IN A LIVE WITNESS. BUT JUSTICE HERE MOST OF THE TIME THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS FINE. AND NINE OF MY LAST QUESTION I GUESS AS YOU RESPOND TO CERTAIN FEATURES SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES GOT. SIMILAR LETTERS BUT I'M A QUOTE FROM ONE SB TWO FORTY ONCE LANGUAGE JUST WELCOME TO UNLICENSED. UNAUTHORIZED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS WITH OPEN ARMS TO CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS AS USUAL CALIFORNIA. UNTIL THE PLAYING FIELD IN THEIR FAVOR AND GOES AGAINST THE LAWS OF THE LEGSLATURE PUT IN PLACE. TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER. IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND YES. I THINK I THINK THAT'S WITH RESPECT TO. THE STATE COURT REPORTERS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A COURT REPORTER WHOSE LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BASICALLY VOUCHING. FOR THE FACT THAT YOU'RE HEARING THE CALIFORNIA'S COURT REPORTING STANDARDS SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU- THE SOCI LOCAL COUNCIL. YOUR COUNCIL FROM ANOTHER STATE. YOU WANNA APPEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO STATE LOCAL COUNCIL FOR THE PURPOSE OF. OF ONE BEING FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL RULES BUT TO THE COURTS LIKE IT BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A LOCAL THROAT TO CHOKE AS IT WERE- AND SO YOU THEN ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR. THE STATE COUNCIL SAME THING HERE YOU GOT A COURT REPORTER IN CHARGE THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW YOU GOT A COURT REPORTER IN CHARGE. WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE OUT OF STATE ENTITIES RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO ONE IN CHARGE THOSE OUT OF STATE IN THESE IN AS THE COURT REPORTING BOARD. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TESTIFIED THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TERMS OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. THANK YOU MISTER. SURVISCOR. I THINK THE AUTHOR I- BY. STEVEN ABOUT ADDRESSING EQUITY I FEEL LIKE I IS PART OF INTENT OF THIS BILL I WOULD JUST MORE CURIOUS THAN ANYTHING TO ME FEELS LIKE THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE IN MY MIND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO RUN A- TO- YOU KNOW TESTIFIED REMOTELY- BUT THE MAIN THRUST THE BILL SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THE REGULATION- AND THIS NEW- THE BORDER NEW DIVISION. I'M JUST WANT TO HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS FIT TOGETHER. IN TERMS OF ACCESS AND THEN TE REALLY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BILL ONE PARTY IS WITH ROOM RESPECT TO REMOTE ACCESS. AND IT BY THE WAY IT DOES SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE- NEARER POTENTIALLY IMPOVERISHED AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY AS WELL NOT NEARLY AS EXPENSIVE AS TRAVELING TO FOR EXAMPLE COURTHOUSE FOR A SIMPLE HEARING NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS THE OTHER PART OF THE BILL- THE CONSUMER PROTECTION PART OF THE BILL IS IT THEN IT PLACES THOSE COURT REPORTERS WHO ARE OUT OF STATE- WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY BY VIRTUE OF THE COURT REPORTER IN CHARGE. NO REPRESENTATIVE. HELLO EXHORTATIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NO HANDS WAVING AND NO MICROPHONES UP CENTER A BIRD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE URGEN IDLE THANK YOU.
