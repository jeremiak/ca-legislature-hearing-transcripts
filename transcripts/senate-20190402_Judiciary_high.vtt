00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.610
LITTLE DID HE KNOW.

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:33.479
THE MATERIAL HE DATED A FOR SO

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.882
MANY YEARS WOULD CAUSE HIS DEATH.

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.250
AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.851

WHETHER THE LAWSUIT WOULD BE

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:50.363
WORTH THE STRESS THAT IT WOULD

00:08:50.429 --> 00:08:52.531
BRING.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.066

THOUGH HE COULD TELL HIS STORY.

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:06.512
HE THOUGHT MAYBE.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.314
IT WOULD HELP OTHERS.

BECAUSE IT GAVE THEM PROFIT EVEN

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.592
THOUGH THE NEW.

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.227

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:24.563
WHO USE THE PRODUCT.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.332

ADDRESS OF EVERY BUILDING HE

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:01.594
ME THAT THEIR GOAL WAS TO SEE IF

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.231

THEY LASTED.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.539
BUT A JUDGE WOULD LIKELY EXCLUDE

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.609
THE ENTIRE DEPOSITION FROM BEING

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:19.245

IT TAKES TIME FOR THAT AND THE

00:20:46.778 --> 00:20:48.647
BURDEN IS ON THE DEFENDANT TO

GO TO TRIAL IF AT ALL THERE'S

00:20:58.223 --> 00:20:59.891

JOB ARE GOING TO TRY TO

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:06.792
REPRESENT THEIR CLIENTS.

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:08.694

WILL USE IT.

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:18.837
AND CLEARLY.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:21.073
THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND OUT A

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.375
DEPOSITION WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:25.243
WHO MAY END UP.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.378
CONFLICTING.

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:27.679

BECAUSE OF THIS DISEASE BOB PART

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:35.454
OF THE GOAL WILL BE TO TRIP THEM

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.855
UP TO GET THEM TO SAY THINGS

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:39.558
THAT ARE INCONSISTENT IN PART.

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:40.792
BECAUSE ARE EXHAUSTED AND

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:41.993
THEY'RE IN PAIN.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.330
AND AND AND THERE ARE REALLY

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:47.666
STRUGGLING TO PARTICIPATE -- SO

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.000
I'VE SEEN THIS IS AN ATTORNEY I

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.802
PRACTICED LAW FOR TWENTY TWO

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:53.338
YEARS I'VE SEEN ALL THE GAMES --

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:55.173
AND I I DON'T BELITTLE THE

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.642
BEHAVIOR IT'S PART OF WHAT YOU

00:22:57.709 --> 00:22:58.977
DO TO REPRESENT YOUR CLIENT --

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:00.912
BUT AS FAR AS THE COURTS ARE

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.881
CONCERNED BY IT'S NOT THE FIRST

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:04.816
TIME THAT WE WILL BE IMPOSING

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.251
CERTAIN RULES AND AND

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.886
RESTRICTIONS ON THE COURTS AND I

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:11.623
APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE CASE

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.225
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BUT I THINK

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:13.425
THAT.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:14.025
HAS A LEGISLATURE WE HAVE THE

00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:15.927
ABILITY TO SET POLICY AND TO

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:17.195
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.398
IF WE ALLOW SEVEN HOURS OF THE

00:23:20.465 --> 00:23:23.034
TESTIMONY OF THE DEPOSITION -- I

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.569
HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT THE

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.937
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WILL GET

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:26.838
TOGETHER.

00:23:26.905 --> 00:23:28.573
AND THEY WILL PREPARE A SEVEN

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.609
HOUR DEPOSITION THAT COVERS THE

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.577
QUESTIONS THAT OTHERWISE THEY

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:35.313
TAKE FIFTY HOURS. TO A

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.681
DEVELOPING AND I CAN THINK OF

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.150
WAYS TO DO IT YOU JUST SIMPLY

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:42.120
ASK -- IN X. YEAR.

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:43.922
WHERE WERE YOU WORKING?

00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:45.757
COMPANY ABC INDY AND THE LAWYERS

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.325
WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:51.163
ASSURE THAT THEIR DEFENDANTS.

00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:53.298
OF A COMPANY IS MENTIONED IN

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:54.833
THAT ONE SENTENCE AND CAN.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.635
HAVE THAT.

00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:58.003
EXAMINATION FOLLOW WITH GROUP

00:23:58.069 --> 00:24:00.772
GREATER SPEED AND SENSITIVITY

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.674
TOWARDS THE NEEDS OF THESE.

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:05.744
PEOPLE WHO ARE CLEARLY DYING AND

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:07.045
I APOLOGIZE THAT.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.880
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS BUT

APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY -- I

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:13.418
THINK THAT THIS IS A A

00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.287
REASONABLE -- BUILD ADDING

00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:17.722
ADDITIONAL TIME IF THE DEFENSE.

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.724
CAN SHOW BECAUSE AS TO WHY THEY

00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:21.593
SHOULD HAVE THAT THREE HOURS.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.095
BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE

00:24:24.162 --> 00:24:26.264
DEPOSITIONS WHEN YOU HAVE NEW

00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:28.567
LAURIE SHASTA SAME QUESTIONS.

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:29.067
ON BEHALF OF A DIFFERENT

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.503
DEFENDANT -- AGAIN MOST LAWYERS

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.004
ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:34.472
PUT IT ALL INTO A SEVEN HOUR

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:35.507
PACKAGE.

THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:41.613
ADVANCE THEIR CLIENTS BECAUSE I

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.248
THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE IT'S

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:45.116
OUR DUTY TO REALLY SAID POLICY

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:46.484
ON WHAT WE ARE GOING TO PERMIT

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:49.721
AND NOT PERMIT SO -- I THINK IT

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:51.823
CREATES REASONABLE LIMITS -- IN

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.726
TAYLOR'S THE THE APPLICATION. TO

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:55.861
THOSE WHO HAVE SO LITTLE TIME

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.262
LEFT IN WHO ARE SUFFERING VERY

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.297
PAINFUL DEATHS BECAUSE OF THIS

MY QUESTIONS -- TO SENATOR

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.004
MONNING -- IT SEEMS AS IF THIS

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.107
IS A IT'S A BALANCE OF DUE

00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:43.141
PROCESS.

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.542
HOW DO WE LOOK AFTER THE

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:46.511
INTEGRITY OF OUR JUDICIAL

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:47.779
PROCESS?

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.147
WHILE ALSO MAKING CERTAIN THAT

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.149
DOESN'T UNFAIRLY BURDEN THOSE

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.618
WHO ARE ALREADY AGGRIEVED --

00:25:53.685 --> 00:25:55.520

AND LIKE ANYTHING AT ALL GOOD

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:01.326
LEGISLATION I THINK HAS A

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.161
BALANCED APPROACH.

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.030
AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS.

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:08.767
I CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE THAT

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:12.837
ARE HOW CERTAIN ADVOCATES BY USE

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.472
STRATEGIC DELAYS.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.041
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:19.878
BUT I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS --

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.246
ONE IS WERE THERE ANY TIME

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:24.182
ASSESSMENTS -- OR STUDIES.

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:27.018
OR EXPERT -- IT YEAH ADVICE

00:26:27.085 --> 00:26:30.055
OFFERED INTO WHETHER SEVEN TO

00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:31.256
TEN HOURS IS APPROPRIATE AS

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:34.159
OPPOSED. TO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:36.394
YES IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THE

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.263
ANSWER IS YES.

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.731
BUT WE CAME AT IT.

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:41.967
FROM THROUGH THE OTHER LANDS OF

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:44.402
LIFE REMAINING THE QUALIFICATION

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:47.005
IN THIS BILL IS THAT IT DR.

00:26:47.072 --> 00:26:49.207
HAS A TESTED THE YOU HAVE LESS

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:50.875
THAN SIX MONTHS TO LIVE AND SO

00:26:50.942 --> 00:26:52.177
THE CLOCK IS RUNNING.

00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:54.312
THAT PLAINTIFF IS GOING TO DIE

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.414
WITHIN SIX MONTHS WE KNOW IN THE

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:59.617
CASE OF MISTER SMITH --

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.852
MICHELLE'S FATHER.

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:02.654
HE WAS DEPOSED FOR FOURTEEN

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.222
HOURS.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:07.292
BUT IT SPANNED THIRTY FIVE DAYS

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.593
IN A SHE TESTIFIED.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.061
WHEN HE WAS CLOSE TO DEATH HE

00:27:10.128 --> 00:27:11.830
COULDN'T SUSTAIN ANSWERING

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:14.099
QUESTIONS FROM MORE THAN FORTY

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:15.767
FIVE MINUTES AT A TIME?

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:17.535
WHAT THIS DISEASE REPLICATE IS

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:24.142
DROWNING THE LUNGS FILL WITH --

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:26.211
WASTE AND IT'S YOU YOU FEEL LIKE

00:27:26.277 --> 00:27:28.947
YOU'RE DROWNING SO WE CAME AT IT

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:29.848
FROM.

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.817
LESS SIX MONTHS OR LESS TO LIVE.

00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:34.486
AND THEN.

00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:35.854
AVERAGED THE ANSWER TO YOUR

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.490
QUESTION AVERAGE DEPOSITIONS

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.859
BEING. TWENTY TO THIRTY HOURS

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:43.328
AND AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:45.997
OFTEN LOT OF DUPLICATION IN THAT.

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.299
SO WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SEVEN

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:50.402
HOURS PLUS THREE IT'S IMPORTANT

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:53.238
TO RECOGNIZE THE SEVEN HOURS IS

00:27:53.304 --> 00:27:54.906
NOT GENERALLY GOING TO BE.

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:57.308
ONE DEPOSITION PERIOD IT'S GOING

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.811
TO EXPAND PROBABLY TWO DAYS

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:01.413
MAYBE THREE DAYS AGAIN BECAUSE

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:02.981
OF THE WEAKNESS.

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:06.084
OF THE DEPONENT -- WE DID

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.318
THROUGH NEGOTIATION ANOTHER

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.020
STILL OPPOSITION BUT WE'VE TRIED

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:11.923
TO FIND A BALANCE AND WE DO --

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.092
DEFERRED THE DISCRETION OF THE

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:18.129
JUDGE TO ADD THREE HOURS -- IN

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:18.963
THAT JUDGE CAN TAKE INTO

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.167
CONSIDERATION THE CONDITION OF

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:23.401
THE PATIENT.

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:24.035
AND IF IF THE DEFENSE IS MADE A

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.837
COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

00:28:25.904 --> 00:28:28.440
FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.375
THE VAST MAJORITY OF QUESTIONS

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:33.078
ASKED BY MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:35.013

RELATION OF THE WORK -- IN THOSE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.724
ALL GET REPEATED THEN IN THE

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:49.060
DEPOSITION TO SEE IF THAT DYING

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:52.230
IS PALM.

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:53.731
IN A PERIOD MAYBE OF IN

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:55.767
COHERENCE -- THEY CAN CONTRADICT

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.569
WHAT WAS IN THE WRITTEN

00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:59.170
INTERROGATORIES SIR LAND SO I I

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.572
I CERTAINLY CAN IMAGINE.

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.673
HOW THAT'S?

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.007
HOW THAT'S BEEN DONE AND

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:08.613
CONTINUES TO BE DONE -- IT'S

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.982
FIND THAT BALANCE -- IN MAYBE

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:16.054
YOU FOUND IT MAYBE NOT -- IT

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.355
WOULD BE HELPFUL IS TO FROM MY

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.057
STANDPOINT I'M JUST ONE MEMBER

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.325
OF THIS COMMITTEE OTHERS MAY

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:21.559
FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:23.461
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE TO SEE A

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:26.431
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY --

00:29:26.498 --> 00:29:27.098
WHILE STILL ACHIEVING THAT SAME

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:28.967
RESULTS -- BUT MY LAST QUESTION

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.235
IS.

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:31.636
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO THIS REALLY

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:34.572
LIMITED TO JUST THESE TWO

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:35.840
MEDICAL CONDITIONS?

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:38.176
IF LIFE EXPECTANCY IS IT SIX

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:39.577
MONTHS FOR LASSEN THAT'S

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:42.046
OBJECTIVELY -- DIAGNOSED.

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:46.518
BY A BOARD CERTIFIED -- DOCTOR.

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.153
WHY WOULDN'T THIS APPLY TO OTHER

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:50.922
FORMS OF -- CANCER STRICKEN

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:52.624
PATIENTS ORANYONE ELSE

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.025
SIMILARLY SITUATED.

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:55.593
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION IN AN

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.428
AMENDMENT THAT I MIGHT.

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.230
WILLINGLY CONSIDER I THINK THE

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.865
REASON WE FOCUSED IN.

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.435
ON MESOTHELIOMA IN SILICA IS

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:05.670
BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE --

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.873
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS CAUSED.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.043
SOME DEATHS FROM EXPOSURE THAT

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.779
ONCE THE DIAGNOSIS IS MADE IT IS

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:18.983
TERMINAL AND IF WE OPEN THAT ALL.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:21.653
END OF LIFE LITIGATION -- IT

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.521
COULD POSE OTHER QUESTIONS LACK

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:25.623
OF CERTAINTY AND DIAGNOSIS WITH

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.227
OTHER CANCER DIAGNOSES AT CETERA.

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:31.029
WE WERE VERY CONFIDENT.

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.798
OF WHAT THE COURSE OF OF LIFE

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.633
AND DEATH IS WITH EXPOSURE TO

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.703
THESE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SO AND

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.004
IN ITS WHERE.

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:43.007
THE PROBLEM IS BEEN IDENTIFIED --

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:45.109
NOT JUST BY.

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:48.146
LAWYERS BUT BY FAMILIES SO ALL

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:50.515
ALL LAST MY FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.350
FOR YOU TO CONSIDER.

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:55.253
THAT YOU MAKE THIS.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.622
FOR MEDICAL TERMINALLY DIAGNOSED

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.891
MEDICAL CONDITIONS SIX MONTHS OR

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:01.759
LESS.

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:03.394
THAT IS NOT BE LIMITED TO THESE

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.530
SPECIFIC TO I THINK IT IS SHOULD

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:06.064
BE ACROSS THE BOARD IN MY

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.700
OPINION -- BUT THAT'S UP FOR YOU

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:09.901
TO COME TO CONSIDER.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:13.071
AND THAT THE OUR RANGE

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:13.371
[inaudible]

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:15.240
BE DOUBLED.

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:18.943
IS LONG AS IT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.045
YEAH I WOULD ACT AS THAT YOU

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.513
JUST CONSIDER THAT FOR YOUR OWN

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.648
THIRD DIVISION.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.282
THANK YOU CAN BUT I JUST WANNA

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:25.583

NEGOTIATE AMENDMENTS HERE AT

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.953

A DIALOGUE WITH YOU -- THE

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.203
SECOND SUGGESTION I THINK THE

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.338
PROBLEM THERE WOULD BE YOU DON'T

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.907
HAVE A JUDICIAL OFFICER IN THE

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.142
DEPOSITION.

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:52.877

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:55.713
GONNA HAVE TO HIT THE PAUSE

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.315
BUTTON IN THE DEPOSITION.

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.884

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:01.319
JUDICIAL.

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:03.588
SOME DIRECTION AS TO WHETHER

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.590
THEY'RE ASKING -- DUPLICATIVE

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:11.362
QUESTIONS AND THEN FOR THE LIFE

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.964
OF THE PLAINTIFF THE PATIENT.

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.032
THE METER DOESN'T PAUSE FOR THEM

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:14.666
THEY CONTINUE AND AS I POINTED

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:16.601
OUT BEFORE.

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:19.203
THE WAY THE DAMAGES WORK.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.371
THERE'S ACTUALLY A SELF INTEREST

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.740
IN KEEPING.

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:25.276

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.347
DO THAT.

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:32.784
BUT WE DEAL WITH HUMAN NATURE.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.787

WE HAVE NO CASE DIRECTLY ON

POINT -- SOME OF THE EXISTING

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.965
CASES WERE NARROWLY DECIDED SO

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.167
PREDICTION IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.769
BUT THE WEIGHT OF THE EXISTING

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.437
PRECEDENT ASK SENATOR MCGUIRE

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:57.641
TWENTY SEVEN IS A

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.143
CONSTITUTIONALLY PERMISSIBLE

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.178
BALLOT ACCESS LAW THAT DOES NOT

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:02.880
CREATE ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.081
FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:06.016
NOW WITHOUT REHASHING ARGUMENTS

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.518
ON THE REALLY GOOD MEMO THAT YOU

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:08.986
ALL RECEIVED ALREADY FROM THE

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:10.721
COMMITTEE'S LAWYERS I'M JUST

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.957
GONNA USE MY TIME TO BOLSTER A

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:15.159
CASE MADE IN THAT MEMO -- AND I

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:15.893
JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW MY

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.528
RESEARCH IS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:18.929
TRANSPARENCY SO I'M HAPPY TO

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:20.497
KIND OF DISCUSS WHAT WE KNOW

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:23.567
EMPIRICALLY ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.468
THESE TYPES OF THINGS.

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:25.836
THE MEMO RIGHTFULLY POINTS TO

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.671
THE DICTA IN A CASE CALLED AL

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:28.839
ANDERSON SKEWS ME THE CELEBRATE

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.107
ST IN WHICH THE SUPREME COURT

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:30.975
SAID.

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.810
THAT STATE THE STATE HAS A LESS

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.411
IMPORTANT INTEREST IN REGULATING

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:36.080
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THAN

00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:37.715
STATEWIDE OR LOCAL ELECTIONS

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.216
BECAUSE THE OUTCOME WILL LARGELY

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.385
BE DETERMINED BY VOTERS OUTSIDE

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.786
THE STATE'S BOUNDARIES.

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:43.654
THE COMMITTEE'S LAWYERS WERE

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.289
RIGHT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS LANGUAGE

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:46.890
BUT IT DOES NOT PRESENT A

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:49.760
SERIOUS THREAT TO SB TWENTY

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.128
SEVEN'S CONSTITUTIONALITY.

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.429
SB TWENTY SEVEN WOULD REGULATE

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.999
ONLY THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY.

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.700
AND ELECTION DECIDED WHOLLY

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:58.335
WITHIN CALIFORNIA.

00:43:58.402 --> 00:43:59.403
EVEN IF THE DICTUM FROM ANDERSON

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.071
WERE TO APPLY IT MERELY

00:44:01.138 --> 00:44:03.440
DISCOUNTS THE STATE'S INTEREST

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:04.641
THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD CLAIM IN

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.477
DEFENDING THE LAW THE INTEREST

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:07.911
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS CLAIMED.

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.146
ARE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN UP HELD

00:44:09.213 --> 00:44:11.548
REPEATEDLY BY THE SUPREME COURT

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.650
AND ALSO INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:15.119
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR FACT PATTERN IN

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:17.688
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT -- WHERE THE

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:18.422
STATE?

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.224
REQUIRED CANDIDATES TO FILE TAX

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.994
RETURNS OR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.662
THAT WAS STATE CANDIDATES THERE.

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:26.597
I CLOSE MY ADDRESSING PRIOR

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:27.765
COMMENTARY ON SB TWENTY SEVEN IN

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:28.599
THE LAST HEARING ON THIS BILL

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.067
MISTER RICHARD WINGER.

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:31.902
RAISE THE ISSUE OF PROCEDURAL

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.971
VERSUS SUBSTANTIVE BALLOT ACCESS

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:36.140
PROVISIONS RIGHTLY POINTING OUT

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.908
THAT OUR MAIN NINTH CIRCUIT

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.977
OPINION ON BALLOT ACCESS FROM A

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:41.378
CASE CALLED SCHAEFER BE TOWNS

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:43.547

00:44:43.614 --> 00:44:44.748
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THAT

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:47.084
PANEL ON WHICH MY JUDGE SAT.

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.353
AND ACTUALLY RICHARD PAINTER

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.055
ALSO CLERKED FOR JUDGE IN IN --

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.656
NO COURT HAS EXPLAINED HOW WE

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.058
DETERMINE WHETHER A BALLOT

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:56.660
ACCESS RESTRICTION IS PROCEDURAL

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.262
OR SUBSTANTIVE IN NATURE.

00:44:58.328 --> 00:44:59.630
I THINK THAT THAT DISTINCTION IS

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:00.831
ACTUALLY ON HELPFUL IN ABOUT THE

00:45:00.898 --> 00:45:02.032
PANEL WOULD AGREE BECAUSE IN

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:04.234

AN EXCEPTION. TO THE

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:07.604
IMPERMISSIBLE SUBSTANTIVE

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.406

YEARS EVER SINCE WE'VE HAD

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.090
GOVERNMENT PRINTED BALLOTS

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.725
STATES HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.227
VIOLATE.

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:12.362
WHAT THE FOUNDERS WANTED FOR THE

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:14.164
COUNTRY THE FOUNDERS?

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:16.233
THE THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.535
WAS VERY UNDEMOCRATIC BUT IT HAD

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:20.537
ONE RADICALLY DEMOCRATIC ASPECT

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.872
TO IT.

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.241
ANYONE WHO WAS AGE [inaudible]

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:27.211
TWENTY FIVE AND A CITIZEN COULD

COULD BE IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.552
UNLESS YOU OWN PROPERTY.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.554
HAMILTON SAID THE TRUE PRINCIPLE

00:47:37.621 --> 00:47:39.022
OF A REPUBLIC IS THAT THE PEOPLE

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:40.657
SHOULD CHOOSE WHOM THEY PLEASE

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:41.892
TO GOVERN THEM.

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:43.060
THIS GREAT SOURCE OF FREE

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:45.529
GOVERNMENT POPULAR ELECTION

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.497
SHOULD BE PERFECTLY PEER AND THE

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.866
MOST UNBOUNDED LIBERTY ALLOWED.

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:52.402
AND LIVINGSTON SAID THE PEOPLE

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.171
ARE THE BEST JUDGES WHO WANT TO

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.573
REPRESENT THEM. TO DICTATE AND

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.442
CONTROL THEM TO TELL THEM HOME

00:47:58.508 --> 00:48:00.677
THEY SHALL NOT ELECT IS TO

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:02.045
BRIDGE THEIR NATURAL RIGHTS.

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.948
I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:06.250
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.517
PUTTING OUT THEIR TAX RETURNS

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:09.386
BUT THIS BILL IS AN ATTACK ON

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.287
VOTING RIGHTS.

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.955
IT SAYS PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.057
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE FOR

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:15.592
PEOPLE WHO WON'T.

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:20.097
NOW IN 2016406% OF THE VOTERS.

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.932
CHOSE TO VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:25.902
WOULDN'T RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS.

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.372
THAT'S THEIR RIGHT THIS BILL.

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:30.040
TRAMPLES VOTING RIGHTS THAT'S

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:33.310
THE PROBLEM WITH IT.

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:35.312
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:48.258
LET'S SAY THAT.

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:50.093
I SAID I AM OPPOSING THIS BUT I

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.896
THINK THAT TAX RETURNS ALONE --

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.731
TOO LITTLE TO INFORM THE

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.433
ELECTORATE THAT VOTERS.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.467
THERE'S JUST NOTHING THERE GIVE

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:59.670
ME AN EXAMPLE.

00:48:59.736 --> 00:49:01.838
IMAGINE MICHAEL KORIE ALONE HAND

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.040
HOW CAPONE DECIDING TO RUN FOR

00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:04.241
PRESIDENT.

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.276
THEY GIVE YOU THEIR TAX RETURNS

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.245
WITH A SMILE.

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.446
THEY'VE GOT PEOPLE COVERING THEM.

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.580
THEY ARE GOING TO HAND YOU

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:11.114
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:12.549
INCRIMINATE THEM SO WHAT ARE WE

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:13.917
LOOKING AT WHERE DID THEY MAKE

00:49:13.984 --> 00:49:15.052
THEIR MONEY.

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.853
HOW MUCH ARE THEY MAKING WHAT

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.855
TAX BRACKET -- THE IN.

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.692
WHAT IS THAT?

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:22.292
TO THAT SEEMS TO BE A WASTE OF

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:23.593
OUR TIME.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.761
THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL THAT

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:26.630
I HAVE.

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:28.999
THAT RESOLVE THE ISSUES OF

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:31.068
TRANSPLANT MAKE THINGS

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:33.437
TRANSPARENT THAT ARE VALUABLE.

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:35.505
DON'T ARE DEFECTED BY LEGAL

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:38.208
CHALLENGES.

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.443
THIS THIS IS GONNA BE HARD TO

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:41.945
BELIEVE BUT THE PROPOSAL I HAVE

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:44.748
FOR MAKING CHANGES TO THIS.

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.984
SENATE BILL -- TWENTY SEVEN

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.486
QUICK START HAVING A SIGNIFICANT

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:50.787
IMPACT.

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:52.556
ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:56.026
BY THE END OF THIS MONTH.

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:57.194
DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.929
IMPLEMENTED.

00:49:58.995 --> 00:49:59.663
VOTERS WOULD START RECEIVING

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:01.231
VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.499
CANDIDATES.

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:04.501
THE RISK OF LITIGATION QUAGMIRES

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.470
WITH THE AVOID.

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.638
THE SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT IS LOW

00:50:08.705 --> 00:50:09.740
COST CREATES NO NEW BARACK

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:12.075
BUREAUCRACY.

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:13.810
HOLD YOUR BREATH.

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:15.078
A SIMPLE IMPROVEMENT WOULD

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:16.713
PROVIDE CANDIDATES WITH A FORMAL

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.748
SERVICE.

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:20.050
RATHER THAN ESTABLISH A BALLOT

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.952
ACCESS REQUIREMENTS.

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.487
A VOLUNTARY BACKGROUND

00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:26.223
INVESTIGATION SERVICE WOULD SELL

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:28.091
BOTH.

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.760
THE EFFORTS TO KEEP EPIC KASEY

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:31.561
PROBLEM AND LEGAL BATTLE

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:33.230
PROBLEMS.

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:36.199
AND A BE A STRONG DETERRENT.

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:37.834
HI THIS IS THE SENATE CANDIDATE

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:38.835
DETERRENT.

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.337
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.838
WOULD BE COMPREHENSIVE CAPABLE

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.206
OF DISCOVERING CRIMINAL

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:45.342
ACTIVITIES WITHOUT RELEASING ANY

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.644
PUBLIC INFORMATION.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.046
THIS PUTS THE DESIGNERS

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:51.915
CANDIDATE IN A QUANDARY.

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.717
THEY FACE A DILEMMA THEY HAVE

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.085
TWO OPTIONS THEY COULD VOLUNTEER

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.887
AND HOPE THEY COVERED THEIR

00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:57.721
TRACKS WILL WELL.

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.389
MEMBERS DISCOVERY SO THAT COULD

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.357
PUT HIM IN PRISON [inaudible]

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:04.428
OR UNLIKE DECLINING TO MAKE TAX

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.763
RETURNS PUBLIC.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.832
THE THE FOR LEGITIMATE REASONS

00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:09.866
IN SOME CASES.

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.935
A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION WOULD

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.671
MAKE NO PRIVATE INFORMATION

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:15.672
PUBLIC.

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.374
DOES LIMóN.

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.375
LEGITIMATE REASONS TO DECLINE OR

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.444
ABSENT.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.078
SO IF A CANDIDATE DECLINES TO

00:51:22.145 --> 00:51:24.781
VOLUNTEER THE PUBLIC IS VERY

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:25.782
WEAK LIKELY TO AND FOR THAT THEY

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.451
HIDING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES THANK

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:28.685

ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY THAT --

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:45.635
MISTER CORLEONE IS TAX RETURNS

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:48.605
WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AUDIT.

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:49.706
THAT'S THE WAY OF COURSE.

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:50.540
SOME MIGHT ARGUE MISTER CORLEY

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:52.409
ANI ACTUALLY DID RUN FOR

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.010
PRESIDENT TO THIS PAST ELECTION

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.146
BUT SOME WOULD ARGUE.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.981
THAT -- THAT TAX RETURNS

00:51:58.048 --> 00:52:00.617

APPLY TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.318
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.152
THE GOVERNOR'S VOLUNTARILY CAN

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:38.154
BE RELEASING HIS TAX RETURNS BUT

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:39.322
MANDATORILY.

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.690
DOES IT WITH THE SUPPLY TO

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.392
EXECUTIVE STATEWIDE OFFICERS IN

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:44.961
CALIFORNIA.

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:47.197

SO AS IS A MEMBER OF THE

00:52:57.674 --> 00:52:58.875
LEGISLATURE OR AS A

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.143
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER WE

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:02.779
ALREADY HAVE TO DISCLOSE MORE ON

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.014
OUR FINANCES.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.348
UNDER THE PRESENT VICE PRESIDENT

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:08.385
A NIGHT STATES AND WOULD WELCOME --

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.953
ANY MEMBER WOULD LIKE BETTER

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.121
BRING FOR THE BILL -- TO BE ABLE

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:13.223
TO DO SO BUT THIS SPECIFIC BILL.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:18.662
IS A VOTER EDUCATION MEASURE FOR

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:20.163
THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.065
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:22.799
OFFERING THE CLARIFICATION.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.134
I THINK THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.435
LOT MORE CREDIBILITY AT LEAST IN

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.704
MY OPINION -- NOT JUST WITH ME

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.739
BUT I THINK ALSO FOLKS ACROSS

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:31.841
THE BOARD IF WE WOULD ALSO

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.610
CONSIDER APPLYING THIS. TO

00:53:33.677 --> 00:53:36.313
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE STATE

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:37.013
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.182
SO HAT MIGHT ALSO APPLY TO THE

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:40.517
PRESENT PERSONALLY.

00:53:40.584 --> 00:53:41.918
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:43.453
HAVE DISCLOSED HIS HIS

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.722
INFORMATION I THINK THERE'S A

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:47.424
LEGACY AND THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.025
PATTERN AND PRACTICE. FOR THAT

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.694
IS STEAMED OFFICE THE HIGHEST

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.095
OFFICE IN THE LAND I THINK IT

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.030
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN GOOD FORM. TO

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.733
FOLLOW SUIT BUT THAT'S NEITHER

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.702
HERE NOR THERE BUT IF IT'S

00:53:58.768 --> 00:53:59.536
SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD

00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:01.271
CONSIDER I'M NOT ASKING UNITS

00:54:01.338 --> 00:54:03.940
REALLY TO DO SO RIGHT NOW -- THE

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:04.774
CHAIR HAS BEEN.

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.610
AS NEEDED -- CLEAR THAT WE'RE

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:09.846
NOT NECESSARILY AMENDING THINGS.

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.948
AT AT THIS JUNCTURE BUT I THINK

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:14.184
IT WOULD PROBABLY SERVE

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.052
EVERYONE'S INTEREST WELL IF IT

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.621
WERE APPLIED STATEWIDE EXECUTIVE

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.989
OFFICERS.

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.890
AS WELL AS THAT PRINCIPLE

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.228
OPPOSITION WOULD BE CLEAR WE'RE

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.529
NOT.

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:27.397
THESE HEARINGS ARE NOT.

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.165
MOMENTS TO NEGOTIATE DIFFERENT

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:31.001
TERMS WE DO THAT IN ADVANCE OF

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:33.503
THE BILLS AND HEARINGS ARE TO

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.538
PRESENT THE BILL AS PROFFERED

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.941

REQUESTED AMENDMENTSTHAT ARE

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:42.612
EITHER TAKEN OR NOT TAKEN -- I

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:43.647
WAS GOING TO GO TO SENATOR STIR

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:44.681
BUT I KNOW THE SENATOR ALLEN

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:49.619
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOME

00:54:49.686 --> 00:54:52.455
STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE.

00:54:52.522 --> 00:54:54.691
BUT I'VE JUST WITH THAT.

CHAIR I MEAN WE YOU KNOW WE ONLY

00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:58.962
GOT THESE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:01.865
ABSOLUTELY WE UNDERSTAND HOW.

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:02.432
I MEAN IT IT'S NOT A TYPICAL

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:02.732
[inaudible]

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.567

TO YOU RAISE CONCERNS AND

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.436
SUGGESTIONS AND AND THAT'S

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:07.570
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE BUT WE'RE

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:09.172
NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE A BACK

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:11.608

THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S THE

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.058
THINK THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:30.960

AND ULTIMATELY FAILED TO DO SO

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.510

LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:12.796
PROCEDURE OVERSEAS SUBSTANTIVE.

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.564
DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.132
MAY PERTAIN TO WHAT THE VICE

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:20.703

WE MAKE THE THE AMBIT THAT WILL

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:27.377
NEVER WHATEVER CANADA HAS TO GO.

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.511
TO THROUGH IS THAT IT IS THAT A

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.513
FACTOR IS SORT OF THIS THIS SORT

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.982
OF EQUAL TREATMENT IDEA RIGHT.

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.784
GOVERNOR DIDN'T HAVE TO RELEASE

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.252
TAX RETURNS IT'S A VOLUNTEER BUT

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:38.922
THE PAST TO FILL AN EMPTY PC

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.323
FORM.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:41.191
SEVEN HUNDRED SO JUST IS IS THAT

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:44.861
SIX LEGALLY SIGNIFICANT OR YEAH

00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:46.095
CLUES YOU HAVE FROM THE THAT IS

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:48.064
THAT'S CLUE I THINK WE HAVE THE

00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:50.233
FIFTH CIRCUIT CASE APPLYING TO

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:51.100
TO STATE.

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:53.870
ELECTED OFFICIALS RATHER THAN

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.139
THE PRESIDENT -- WHERE THAT THE

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:57.707
CHOICE WAS GIVEN BETWEEN A

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.275
DISCLOSURE FORM THAT SEEM TO

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:00.977
HAVE PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:03.246
THAT TAX RETURN HAD? FOR A TAX

00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:04.781
RETURN.

00:58:04.848 --> 00:58:06.516
AND THAT WAS UP HELD -- YEAH AND

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.551
SO I I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHY I

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.352
THINK IT'S ON DECENT FOOTING

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:11.654
HERE -- PART OF THE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.356
JUSTIFICATION FOR UPHOLDING IT

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.457
WAS ABOUT REVEALING CONFLICTS OF

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.226
INTEREST IS THE SAME KIND OF

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:16.793
THING THAT THE SENATORS BEEN

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:17.727
TALKING ABOUT SO.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.796
IT SEEMS POSSIBLE TO ME BUT INTO

00:58:19.863 --> 00:58:22.198
WAR THAT THAT THAT'S IT WAS IN

00:58:22.265 --> 00:58:24.834
OR THAT'S RIGHT YEAH PATHWAYS

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:25.935
AND WHO.

00:58:26.002 --> 00:58:26.936
IN THE HELL THAT'S RIGHT.

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:27.937
YEAH ON THE PROCEDURE IN

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:29.639
SUBSTANCE THING JUST TO KIND OF

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:31.274
WRAP THAT UP IF YOU'RE WILLING

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:34.043
TO LET ME -- I JUST WANT TO

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.012
POINT OUT THAT THE THE THE SOME

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:37.113
OF THE THINGS ABOUT HELD DON'T

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.548
REALLY FIT PROCEDURE.

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:40.550
OKAY SO I THAT'S WHY I THINK THE

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:41.951
DISTINCTIONS NO GOOD -- EVEN

00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:43.152
THOUGH IT IS THE NINTH CIRCUIT

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.687
SO REQUIRING TO BE PEOPLE TO

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:45.955
QUIT THEIR FEDERAL JOBS BEFORE

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.457
RUNNING FOR OFFICE DOESN'T

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:48.725
STRIKE ME AS PROCEDURAL.

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.493
REQUIRING PEOPLE IN THIS IS THE

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.362
NINTH CIRCUIT CASE -- UP HOLDING

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:53.596
A LAW REQUIRING ARIZONA'S

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:54.964
ELECTED OFFICIALS TO WAIT UNTIL

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.368
RUN FOR FEDERAL OFFICE.

00:58:58.434 --> 00:58:59.335
SO THOSE DON'T FEEL PROCEDURAL

00:58:59.402 --> 00:59:00.937
TO ME RIGHT AND SO THAT WAS

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.038
SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.207

FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:13.503
THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE RENTAL

RENTAL RELIEF TO ACTIVE DUTY

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.107

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.042
DUTY.

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:21.844
BASED IN CALIFORNIA BY REDUCING

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.279
THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT.

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:25.314

PAY TO MOVE INTO A RENTAL UNIT --

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.284
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:40.997
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

CALIFORNIA WHICH MAKES IT

WITH MILITARY BARRACKS BECOMING

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.309

THE NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF

MILITARY PERSONNEL.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.021
LET ME JUST GET THAT OUT OF THE

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:33.555
WAY -- SECONDLY IS IT HERE'S MY

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:36.792
CONCERN MY CONCERN IS THAT.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.927
BECAUSE ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY OR

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:41.497
ANY THE VETERANS OR OTHERS ARE

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.599
NOT A PROTECTED CLASS THE WHAT

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:44.700
LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO DO IS

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.235
SIMPLY NOT RENT TO MILITARY

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.871
PERSONNEL THAT'S AN EASY WAY OUT.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.005
AND SO THEN WE'RE GOING TO

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:51.807
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:52.908
MILITARY PERSONNEL ARE GOING TO

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.310
HAVE TO ACTUALLY PAY MORE.

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:58.380
SO IF WE SIMPLY SAY YOU CAN'T

01:11:58.447 --> 01:11:59.648
PUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT DOWN THE

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.883

IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS ISSUE IN

A PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE MOVING

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.094
FROM MOST PLACES THE COUNTRY TO

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.562
CALIFORNIA WILL COST OF LIVING

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:14.930
COSTS RENT IS.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.598
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER YOU KNOW

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.567
ONE REMEDY IT IN AND OF COURSE

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.869
WE DON'T CONTROL THE MILITARY.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:21.937
IS.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.206
TO SOMEHOW MAKE SURE THAT BE A

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.842

MARINE WHATEVER IT MAY BE SO

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.413
THERE'S NOT A TIME LAG -- AND

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.082
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LEVEL OF

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:34.850
ASSISTANCE THAT IS AVAILABLE

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.185
RIGHT NOW BUT I'M VERY VERY

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:37.720
CONCERNED THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:38.854
TO DO HERE IS WE'RE GOING TO

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:39.988
CREATE A SITUATION.

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.524
WHERE LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.293
DISCRIMINATE I THINK LANDLORDS

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:46.361
TODAY LEAST IN OUR AREA IN

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:47.429
ORANGE COUNTY?

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.998
DO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST MILITARY

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:52.334
PERSONNEL BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.503
CONCERNED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.537
DEPLOYMENTS AND THAT KIND OF

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:56.138
THING.

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.240
SO I'M I AM QUITE CONCERNED THEY

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:02.711
WERE GONNA EXACERBATE THAT -- IT

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.246

OF FEEDBACK AND CERTAINLY

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.222
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ACTED A

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:16.425
MILITARY IS IT IS AN ISSUE

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.760
IRRESPECTIVE OF THIS BILL.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:18.393
AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.161
AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.263
STATE TO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.465
THAT WE PROTECT OUR ACTIVE DUTY

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.833
SERVICE MEMBERS AND SO.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.602
WHEREVER THAT DISCRIMINATION IS

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:28.170
OCCURRING WE SHOULD ACTIVELY.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.238
TALK ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:31.473
ENFORCE OUR RULES THIS BILL

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.074
WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT YOU

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:32.775
CANNOT.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.576
AND IF THERE ARE VIOLATIONS OF

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:36.745
IT -- UPON ENACTMENT I THINK IT

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.313
REQUIRES OUR OUR SPECIAL

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:42.351
ATTENTION OKAY I REALLY -- I I I

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:42.918

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:05.073
DISCRIMINATION CLAUSES AND

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:07.709
PERHAPS OF THE BILL DOES A MOVE

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.211
FORWARD THERE CAN BE ADDITIONAL

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.546
PROTECTIONS.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:11.980
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THESE

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:14.116
SECURITY DEPOSITS AND THE FACT

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.417
THAT THE MONEY DOESN'T COME IN

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.187
FAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOU TO GET.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.855

TO HELP OUT THE MILITARY FOLKS

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.348

FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THEY HAVE

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.623
ALL THE RIGHTS THAT ALL THE

CALIFORNIA HAS SO WITH THAT

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:01.296

WOULD HATE THAT MORE RIGHT.

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:10.038
BUT IT SEEMS MEDIA ANALYSIS

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:14.610
TALKS ABOUT THAT AS A AS A

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:15.444

AT THE A SERVICE MEMBER HAS AN

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.555
OBLIGATION THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.457
ANY OTHER CIVILIAN -- AND THE

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:29.625
THAT THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:31.159
THE MILITARY CODE WHICH MAKES IT

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.494
CLEAR THAT THAT THERE IS AN

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.429
EXPECTATION OF CONDUCT WHICH IS

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:36.131
ENFORCEABLE IN THE MILITARY NOT

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.266
IN CIVIL COURT.

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.134
BUT IN THE MILITARY -- AND THAT

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:41.570

AND I I'M.

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.350
FIVE EARLIER UNFORTUNATELY --

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.719
FOR A CIVILIAN THERE IS NO SUCH --

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:00.122
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN PLACE --

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:02.157
THAT MATCHES ANYWHERE NEAR WHAT

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.692
WOULD BE REQUIRED OF AN ACTIVE

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.560
DUTY SERVICEMEMBERS SO WELL I

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:06.528
THINK YOUR POINT IS --

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:08.096
THOUGHTFUL ONE ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.665
CARE FOR EVERYONE IN TERMS OF

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:10.766
THEIR UNIQUE FINANCIAL

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.101
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTHOUGH IT RISKS

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.569
BEING RESPECTFUL FOR THE THE

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.271
LIABILITY ISSUE ON THE LANDWARD

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.206
SIDE -- THIS IS THIS IS A UNIQUE

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.574
CLASS AND THERE'S AN ENFORCEABLE

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:20.709
PROVISION UNDER THIS UNIQUE

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.911
CLASS THAT WOULD NOT BE IN PLACE

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.513
FOR CIVILIAN.

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:25.747
YEAH I JUST I CAN'T UNDERSCORE

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.783
THE THE FACT THAT THAT ACTIVE

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.217
MEMBERS CAN FILE BANKRUPTCY

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.053
THOSE RIGHTS AND THAT WHEN YOU

01:16:31.119 --> 01:16:32.387
WHEN YOU SUGGEST THAT THEY HAVE

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:33.722
TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS THEY

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:35.257
HAVE TO DRESS APPLICATIONS

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:35.824
BECAUSE I'VE HAD COMMANDING

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:36.692
OFFICERS.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:37.926
TELL ME IS THE ATTORNEY FOR

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:40.128
THESE FOLKS THAT WE WE DON'T

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:41.229
WANT THEM TO NOT ANSWER THE

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:43.065
LETTERS TO NOT ADDRESS THE DEBT

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.733
PROBLEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO DO

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.935
THIS IN AN ACCEPTABLE -- A

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.337
REMEDY WHAT UNDERNEATH THOSE

01:16:48.403 --> 01:16:50.472
PARAMETERS ARE THE FILE

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.607
BANKRUPTCY AND TO PAY NOBODY.

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.242
NOBODY SO WHILE IT IT'S

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.178
SUGGESTED THAT THEY PAID THEY

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:58.246
THEY ADDRESS THE THING I JUST

01:16:58.313 --> 01:16:59.781
THINK THAT THERE IS.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.383
A BENEFIT FOR ALL RENTERS TO

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.085
REFER ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:03.952
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.854
EXCEPT TO ALL THESE BENEFITS AND

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.122
I THINK IT'S A CHERRY SUGGESTED

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.691
THE TWENTY ONE DAYS IS IS A LONG

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:11.526
TIME FOR ANYBODY TO WAIT TO GET

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.095
THEIR MONEY BACK AFTER THEY'VE

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.429
CHECKED OFF ALL THE BOXES.

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:16.665
ARE I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WOULD

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:17.132
BE A BRILLIANT BILL.

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.633
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.769
PROBLEM A LITTLE BIT BEYOND

01:17:20.836 --> 01:17:23.972
CHEST THE THE ISSUES HERE IF I

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:25.741
COULD TO RESPOND.

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:27.209
CENTER I'M BURKE ON PAGE THREE

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.111
OF THE BILL ALIGNS TWENTY TWO

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:30.412
THROUGH.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.246
TWENTY SEVEN A LANDLORDS FROM

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:32.814
NOT REFUSED TO ENTER INTO A

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:34.616
RENTAL AGREEMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.084
PROPERTY WITH A PROSPECTIVE

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:38.053
TENANT TO WAS A MILITARY SERVICE

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:38.754
MEMBER.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.489
BECAUSE THIS PARAGRAPH PROHIBITS

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.290
THE LANDLORD FROM DEMANDING

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:43.792
RECEIVING A GREATER AMOUNT OF

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.827
SECURITY THAN THAT WHICH IS

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:48.363
ESTABLISHED IN PARAGRAPH.

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.266
ONE AND AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES --

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.235
AND AND I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

HE IS CORRECT THAT THEY DID.

01:17:58.206 --> 01:17:59.408
THE HASN'T HAD A WHOLE LOT OF

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.410
TIME TO MEMORIZE THEM BUT AS IS

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:04.746
SUGGESTED AS IS SUGGESTED IN THE

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.082
ANALYSIS UP PERHAPS AN

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.151
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WOULD BE

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.652
AN APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.387
GOING FORWARD IT JUST SIMPLY

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:13.989
PROHIBITS IT BUT THERE IS NO.

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:17.025
ACTUAL MECHANISM IN THERE SO

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.994
CENTER I'M PRODUCING TO HAVE.

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:20.829
ANOTHER QUESTION PLEASE GO AHEAD.

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:28.837
SO MADAM CHAIR I TAKE YOUR POINT --

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:30.372

I'M NOT SURE -- TO CENTER ALAN'S

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:33.708
POINT TO HOW YOU AND FORCE IT

01:18:33.775 --> 01:18:34.476
BUT BUT WITH THE CAVEAT HERE

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:34.910
THAT SAYS.

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:35.877
BECAUSE THIS PARAGRAPH PROHIBITS

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:36.678
THE LANDLORD FROM DEMANDING

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:37.579
RECEIVING GREATER AMOUNT.

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:38.547
OF SECURITY YOU KNOW PERHAPS IT

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:39.881
WOULD BE BETTER TO STRIKE THAT

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:41.783
CLAUSE ANOTHER WORDS YOU JUST

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.351
CAN'T DISCRIMINATE BASED ON

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:46.588
SOMEONE'S MILITARY STATUS SO.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:47.589
IF YOU TAKE OUT BY CLAUSE

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.091
THERE'S NO NEED TO PROVE THAT

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:50.826
THE DISCRIMINATION IT IS A

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.327
RESULT OF SOMEHOW.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.429
BEING REQUIRED PROVIDE AND IN

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:55.831
ADDITIONAL SECURITY DEPOSIT.

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:56.832
SO.

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.633
WONDERFUL IDEA AND THERE IS A

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.202
BILL THAT SENATOR HILL WILL BE

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.504
PRESENTING TO THIS COMMITTEE SB

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.239
TWO TWENTY TWO WHICH I BELIEVE

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:05.707
ADDRESSES THAT EXACT ISSUE.

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:06.508
SO.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.343
AS A FOLLOW ON ONE OF THE

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:10.011
CHALLENGES IS THAT THE AND I

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.146
KNOW I AM.

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:12.180
DEEPLY CONCERNED BECAUSE

01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.982
EXPERIENCES NOT PERSONALLY BUT

01:19:14.049 --> 01:19:16.151
WITH FOLKS PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.553
LOWER ENLISTED RANKS -- WHERE

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.655
THERE IS RAMPANT DISCRIMINATION

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:22.424
IN BOTH HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.526
BECAUSE OF ONE'S MILITARY STATUS

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.628
OF SPOUSAL STATUS OF SOMEONE IN

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.029

NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT TO DO BUT

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.175
I I AM.

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.543
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.011
THIS BILL COULD BE MORE DRAMATIC

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:46.448
THAN THE THAN THE ACTUAL ISSUE

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:47.916

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:49.751
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT.

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.186
THERE'S SOME SORT OF PROVISION

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:53.388
THAT THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE -- A

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.724

AT A PRIVATE FIRST CLASS MAY

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.464
WELL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:03.598
MEETING THAT KIND OF AN

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.766
OBLIGATION.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:06.735
SOUL I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.069
WAY TO TELL YOU WHAT I'LL

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.571

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:08.456
RELEVANT FACTORS UNDER.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:11.125
SB FOUR NINETY FIVE THIS WILL

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:12.727
NOT CHANGE.

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:14.495
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS OLD

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.397
CONTROLLING CASE LAW THAT ALSO

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:18.433
PERMITS A COURT TO CONSIDER

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:21.169
IRRELEVANT FACTORS SUCH AS THE

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:23.771
LGBT Q. STATUS OF A PARENT.

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:25.206
THE LEAD CASE REGARDING DON

01:27:25.273 --> 01:27:28.176
HETEROSEXUAL PARENTS FROM

01:27:28.242 --> 01:27:28.676
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:29.677
MARRIAGE OF BIRDS SOL.

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:31.079
WHICH ALLOWS THE COURT EVEN

01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:32.714
TODAY TO CONSIDER.

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.816
THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION OF THE

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.017
PARENT.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.619
APPARENT SEX OR SEXUAL

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:39.587
ORIENTATION IS A RELEVANT TO A

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:42.056
BEST INTEREST ANALYSIS IT'S TIME

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.558
TO CLARIFY THE CASE LAW AND

01:27:43.625 --> 01:27:44.892
BRING THE LAWN TO CONFORMITY

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.160
WITH SCIENCE.

01:27:46.227 --> 01:27:48.062
WHICH OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWS THAT

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:51.065
HAVINGAN LGBT Q. PARENT DOES

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:52.367
NOT HARM A CHILD.

01:27:52.433 --> 01:27:53.635
THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE REMOVED

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:55.203
FROM CUSTODY DETERMINATION SO

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:56.571
THAT EVERY PARENT IS VIEWED

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:57.639
EQUALLY.

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:59.641
I ALSO KNOW THAT AS DRAFTED THIS

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:01.309
LEGISLATION WILL MAKE THE LAW

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.711
BIAS FREE WITH RESPECT TO EVERY

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:04.646
PARENT.

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:07.281
NOT JUST LGBT Q. PARENTS.

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:08.816
ELIMINATING THESE -- RELEVANT

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:10.985
FACTORS FROM A BEST INTEREST

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:13.021

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.294
THE FACE OF THE STATUTE IT WILL

01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:21.396
MOSTLY.

BENEFIT CHILDREN BY REDUCING THE

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.589
THAT HOMOSEXUALITY MAY BE

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:49.523
CONSIDERED.

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:51.592
A FACTOR.

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:53.427
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION.

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:55.596
THAT THE LAW.

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:56.964
MAY BE LOCATED ELSEWHERE

01:33:57.031 --> 01:33:58.666
PREVAILING LAW.

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:02.036
HAD DONE AWAY WITH THAT AS OF

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.271
FACTORS THAT.

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:06.007
IN MY MISSING SOMETHING -- NOT

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.242
ALONE SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.177
YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTION.

01:34:10.244 --> 01:34:11.379
WE WERE SHOCKED TO FIND THIS

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:13.180
LITTLE.

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:15.149
HOLE IN THE LONG.

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:17.785
IT IS STILL ON THE BOOKS NADLER

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.420
IS STILL GOOD LAW CHAFIN STILL

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.455
GOOD LAW OTHER HORRIBLE CASES

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:22.857
THEIR OLD CASES.

01:34:22.923 --> 01:34:24.792
BIRDS DAHLE IS THE LAST TIME

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.395
ANYBODY HAS SPOKEN ON THIS AT

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.563
THE THE LAW LEVEL THERE THAT'S

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:30.731
CASE LAW.

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:32.700
AND IT'S NOT TERRIFIC FOR LGBTQ

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.035
PEOPLE SO THIS.

01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:36.103
STATUTE WOULD MAKE IT VERY VERY

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:38.572
CLEAR IN LANGUAGE THAT'S JUST

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.707
PLAIN.

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:42.276
BAD ODD THE SAYS GENDERED

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:43.944
HETEROSEXUAL MAN.

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:45.513
WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE SAME WAY

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.748
AS LGBT Q. PARENTS EVERYBODY'S

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:50.117
TREATED THE SAME.

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:53.788
OKAY BUT WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY.

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.723
ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY ACTIONS

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:57.491
WERE COURTS HAVE USE THAT AS A

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.759
AS A FACTOR IN THEIR

01:34:58.826 --> 01:35:00.428
DETERMINATION.

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.396
THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.432
OF THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.699
THE LONG BEACH BAR.

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:08.169
LA COUNTY HAS STATISTICALLY

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:11.505
ABOUT 31% OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:13.441
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE

01:35:13.507 --> 01:35:14.909
HAVE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.710
LITIGATE THESE MATTERS -- MANY

01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:18.546
DO NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF

01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:19.780
APPELLATE COURT CASES BUT

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.182
THERE'S PLENTY OF ANECDOTAL

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:22.083
EVIDENCE.

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:24.351
THAT PARENTS WILL USE WHAT THEY

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:25.753
CAN TO BEAT ON EACH OTHER.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.288
IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE VERY

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.590
CONSERVATIVE AND THIS JUST TAKES

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:32.626
AWAY SOMETHING THAT ESCALATES --

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.528
AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION

01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:35.830
FOR CHILDREN.

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:38.132
INTO AN ACRIMONIOUS EVENT.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.800
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I WANT

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.001
TO THANK YOU ALSO FOR BRINGING

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:42.837
THIS SITE STARTED PRACTICING LAW

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.872
AT A POINT IN TIME WE'RE WOMEN

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:48.042
WHO -- CAME OUT OR WERE.

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:49.710
OUTED AS LESBIANS WERE JUST BY

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.512
VIRTUE THAT STATUS LOSING THEIR

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:54.582
CHILDREN FREQUENTLY TO ABUSIVE.

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:55.883
OTHER PARENTS BUT CHOSE THEIR

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.252
STATUS SO I THINK WE'VE COME A

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:00.121
LONG WAY THIS I THINK WILL HELP

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:01.655
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.424
ISSUE BEFORE US.

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.126
IT'S MY HOPE THAT THE COURTS

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:08.162
WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO DO SOME

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.599
TRAINING ON THIS FOR THE

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:12.900
IMPLICIT BIAS THAT DOES.

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:14.635
OF THE SADLY CONTINUE TO EXIST

AND WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO TO

01:36:26.981 --> 01:36:28.082
CORRECT THAT AND HOPEFULLY.

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:30.284
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOMETHING IN

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:31.852

01:36:31.919 --> 01:36:34.188

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:57.518
MATTERS THAT MANDATES THE COURT

01:40:57.584 --> 01:41:00.888
TO INVALIDATE AN ELECTION.

01:41:00.954 --> 01:41:02.523
IF THERE IS MISCONDUCT.

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.291
LARA VIOLATION OF THE STATUTE OR

01:41:04.358 --> 01:41:06.994
THEIR OF RULES HAS BEEN FOUND.

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.830
ABSENT OF THE ASSOCIATION

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:10.931
CARRYING THE BURDEN OF

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:13.367
ESTABLISHING THAT THE MISTAKE

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.502
WAS ON INTENTIONALLY DID NOT

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.403
AFFECT THE OUTCOME [inaudible]

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:21.308
MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN -- FROM.

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:22.676
MANY YEARS ON THE BENCH I'VE

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:25.412
BEEN HEARING SMALL CLAIMS CASES.

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:27.381
OF FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS I

01:41:27.448 --> 01:41:29.016
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.285
A AS A BE A COMMISSIONER FROM

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:34.288
SPIRIT COURT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:36.089
AND I ALSO CHAIRED THE JUDICIAL

01:41:36.156 --> 01:41:37.558
COUNCILS.

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:39.960
SUBCOMMITTEE ON SMALL CLAIMS AND

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:42.262
LIMITED CASES FOR FIVE YEARS.

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:44.198
AND BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE I

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.600
BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THIS

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:47.901
MANDATE IS NEEDED [inaudible]

01:41:47.968 --> 01:41:49.903
IS THAT.

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.939
SMALL CLAIMS JUDGES ARE NOT USE

01:41:52.005 --> 01:41:54.174
TO GRANTING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

01:41:54.241 --> 01:41:55.342
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COMMON

01:41:55.409 --> 01:41:56.610
THE DONE.

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:57.811
IN FACT THERE'S A PROHIBITION

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:58.879
UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIFIC

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:01.582
STATUTE AND OFTENTIMES.

01:42:01.648 --> 01:42:03.717
THE JUDGE MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.519
KNOW ABOUT THE PROVISION BUT

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:06.887
THEY'RE RELUCTANT TO GET INTO

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:09.389
THAT AREA AND CIVIC.

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.091
EXCUSE ME THE GUIDANCE THAT THIS

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:13.260
MANDATE PROVIDES A IS VERY

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:16.096
IMPORTANT TO GET ACTUAL RELIEF.

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:17.498
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

01:42:17.564 --> 01:42:18.732
APPRECIATE YOUR TEST BY MARJORIE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.567
MARIE CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:22.236
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW.

01:42:22.302 --> 01:42:23.670
AND THE FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:24.738
THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.507
EXTREMELY DETAILED ANALYSIS

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:29.343
WHICH REALLY LAYS OUT THE ISSUES

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:31.011
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY --

01:42:31.078 --> 01:42:33.881
WE WERE A MEMBER OF THE ORIGINAL

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:36.517
WORKING GROUP IN TWO THOUSAND

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:38.519
FIVE THAT CRAFTED THE EXISTING

01:42:38.585 --> 01:42:40.187
LAWS GOVERNING HOMEOWNER

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:42.956
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS.

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:44.591
AND THE TITLE OF THOSE STATUTES

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:47.294
WERE FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY IN

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.862
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS FOR GOOD

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.830
REASON.

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:52.833
THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH OF ABUSE.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.868
SO THAT WAS AN EFFORT TO CLEAN

01:42:54.935 --> 01:42:57.271
UP ELECTIONS AND I THINK WE HAVE

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:59.072
GONE A LONG WAY TOWARDS DOING

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.941
THAT HOWEVER IN THE INTERVENING

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:01.708
YEARS.

01:43:01.775 --> 01:43:03.911
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN THEY

01:43:03.977 --> 01:43:07.614
BECAME LAW WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY --

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:11.451
DOCUMENTED TOO MANY ABUSES.

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:12.519
REGARDING THE INABILITY OF

01:43:12.586 --> 01:43:14.788
PEOPLE TO RUN FOR A BOARD SEAT

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:17.457
OR EVEN TO GET A BALLOT TO VOTE

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:18.892
IN AN ELECTION.

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:21.762
SO -- IN MY TESTIMONY I REALLY

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:24.364
ONLY WANT TO STRESS ONE POINT.

01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:26.066
AND THAT IS -- WHY SHOULD WE

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:29.736
CARE ABOUT ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS

01:43:29.803 --> 01:43:31.171
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:33.674
MAINLY BECAUSE AND I'M HERE I'M

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.609
KICKING OFF -- A SECTION OF THE

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:38.579
ANALYSIS WHICH IS THAT HOMEOWNER

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:40.447
ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT COUNTRY

01:43:40.514 --> 01:43:41.448
CLUBS.

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:42.516
THEY'RE NOT NEIGHBORHOOD

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:43.784
ASSOCIATIONS ARE PUT ON

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:46.553
BARBECUES THEY ARE AS THE

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.689
APPELLATE COURTS HAVE RULED

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:49.823
REPEATEDLY.

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.725
THESE ARE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:53.493
THAT HAVE POWERS THAT OFTEN

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:56.263
EXCEED THOSE OF CALIFORNIA

01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:58.665
CITIES AND COUNTIES.

01:43:58.732 --> 01:44:01.268
THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS ANALYSES

01:44:01.335 --> 01:44:02.569
OF BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:03.904
IT PARTICULARLY THE ELECTION

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:04.838
BILLS.

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.307
HAVE ALSO REPEATED THIS THE

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:08.642
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.877
QUAYSIDE GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:13.380
WITH EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OVER

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.749
THE LIVES AND PROPERTY OF THE

01:44:15.816 --> 01:44:17.084
PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE.

01:44:17.150 --> 01:44:19.086
HAD I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

01:44:19.152 --> 01:44:21.488
THAT HOW WE ARE NOT ALONE IN

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.056
THIS BELIEF.

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.691
IT'S A CURIOUS TO US IN FACT

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.693
IT'S BAFFLING THAT THE OPPONENTS

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.695
OF THE BILL ACTUALLY BELIEVE THE

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:30.230
SAME THING.

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:31.865
IF YOU LOOK AT MARKETING

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.533
MATERIALS FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.637
ASSOCIATION'S INSTITUTE.

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:39.239
IT SAYS THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.274
ASSOCIATIONS ARE DEVELOPED IN

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:43.310
OPERATE IN AN INTER GOVERNMENTAL

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:46.013
SYSTEM COMPOSED OF UNITS OF

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:47.748
LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:49.683
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:51.485
THEIR MARKETING MATERIAL SAY THE

01:44:51.551 --> 01:44:53.487
REASON THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:54.921
IN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS IS

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:56.123
THAT THEY ARE A FORM OF

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.557
DEMOCRACY.

01:44:57.624 --> 01:44:59.426
IN WHICH LEADERS ARE ELECTED BY

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:00.894
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:03.630
SO EVEN THE OPPONENTS OF THE

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.465
BILL AGREE WITH US THAT

01:45:05.532 --> 01:45:07.601
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE A

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.069
FORM OF GOVERNMENT.

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.337
AND THAT THE CODE OF THE

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.572
ELECTIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTED IN

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.675
THEM NEED TO REACH THE SAME

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.610
STANDARDS OF FAIRNESS AND

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:19.279
INTEGRITY BUT WE EXPECT OF OTHER

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:20.981
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT IN

01:45:21.048 --> 01:45:23.884
CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THAT I

SIXTY FIVE LAST YEAR WHICH WAS

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:05.992
VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR.

WE GOT BY GOVERNOR BROWN STATING

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:09.329
IT WAS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:46:09.396 --> 01:46:10.630
APPROACH THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.099
ALL ASSOCIATIONS.

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:13.100

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:29.816
THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:31.284
DOLLARS.

01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:32.219
AND THEN.

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.587
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE

ASSOCIATIONS.

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:36.523

ARE ONE OF OUR MAJOR CONCERNS

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:44.464
WITH THIS BILL JUST LIKE WITH

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:45.665
LAST YEAR'S BILL IS THAT IT'S

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:47.100
GOING TO CREATE MORE COMPLEXITY.

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:49.035
MORE CONFUSION MORE MISTAKES

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:50.370
WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY END UP IN

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:51.938
MORE LITIGATION.

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:53.473
SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THE

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.841
POINTS OF THE BILL THAT WE'VE

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.576
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN LAST

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.078

STAYING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.020
ASSESSMENT AND THAT IS ONE OF

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:08.789
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:12.025
SOMEONE SIGNS UP TO DO -- BUT

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.126

WE BELIEVE EXISTING LAW

01:47:29.142 --> 01:47:30.911

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:32.546
FAILURE TO PAY ASSESSMENTS RIGHT

01:47:32.612 --> 01:47:34.214

ORIGINAL STATUTE FROM -- TWO

01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:55.081
THOUSAND FIVE THAT.

PREPARE THE PLEA PLEADINGS.

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:04.290

REIMBURSEMENT OF THOSE FEES FROM

01:56:06.559 --> 01:56:07.994

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.416
ON THE TWO SPOKE -- PROBABLY

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:32.218
SPEAKS FOR THE MAJORITY GETTING

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.820

THAT YOU THINK COULD BE ACHIEVED

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.150
THAT WOULD REMEDY SOME OF THE

01:57:04.217 --> 01:57:05.885
CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:07.420

MORE.

01:59:01.501 --> 01:59:03.669

THE BILL SO THAT WE CAN ONLY DO

02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:53.813
THAT THROUGH AN AMENDMENT TO OUR

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:54.714
BIOS.

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:56.682
MEMINTA THE BYLAWS ACTUALLY

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:57.817
SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE YOUR

02:00:57.883 --> 02:01:00.052
ATTORNEY DO WHICH HAS SOME COST

02:01:00.119 --> 02:01:01.387
AND THEN.

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:03.422
REQUIRES ANOTHER ELECTION AN

02:01:03.489 --> 02:01:04.890
ELECTION AND HAS TO BE PASSED

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.859
BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE IN THE

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:09.061
BYLAWS SO THAT CHANGE ALONE IF

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:11.063
IF YOU HAVE WITHIN YOUR ELECTION

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:11.397
RULES.

02:01:11.464 --> 02:01:13.332
A PROHIBITION MAKING SURE THAT

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:14.467
EVERYONE IS IN GOOD STANDING

02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:15.868
AROUND FOR THE BOARD WOULD NOW

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:17.336
HAVE TO BE PUT THROUGH YOUR BY

02:01:17.403 --> 02:01:18.337
LAWS.

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:19.972
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL COSTS WE

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:21.741
BELIEVE THAT THE BILL STILL

02:01:21.807 --> 02:01:24.410
ALLOWS FOR THE ELECTION

02:01:24.477 --> 02:01:27.446
MATERIALS TO BE COPIED.

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:30.249
AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE

02:01:30.316 --> 02:01:31.884
BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HAVE A

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:33.619
SUPPRESSION ON VOTER

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.588
PARTICIPATION BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:36.856
HAVE ACCESS.

02:01:36.922 --> 02:01:38.624
NOT ONLY TO THE BALLOT STILL

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:40.393
HAVE ACCESS TO THE SIGN ALMOST

02:01:40.459 --> 02:01:41.827
EVERYONE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:44.330
THAT THE ELECTION PROCESS FOR AN

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:45.965
H. AWAY REQUIRES YOU.

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.800
WHEN YOU GET YOUR MATERIALS YOU

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:49.268
PUT A?

02:01:49.335 --> 02:01:51.904
YOU SEE YOU MARK YOUR BALLOT.

02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:54.273
YOU PUT THAT IN AN ENVELOPE

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.408
SEALED THAT ENVELOPE.

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.743
PUT THAT IN A NOTHER ENVELOPE TO

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:59.512
WHICH YOU SIGN.

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.547
AND SO WHILE WE MADE AN ISSUE

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:03.849
LAST YEAR DEALING THAT THE BILL

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.518
SPECIFICALLY STATED.

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.919
THAT ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:08.654
COULD BE COPIED.

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.322
AMENDMENT WAS MADE TO MAKE THOSE

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.324
PART OF THE ELECTION MATERIAL OR

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:12.925
MAKE THOSE PART OF THE

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:15.261
ASSOCIATION RECORDS.

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:16.929
AND THEN IT HAS WORDS IN THE

02:02:16.996 --> 02:02:19.031
BEGINNING OF IT SAYS EXCEPT FOR

02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:20.766
PURPOSES OF THIS ARTICLE.

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:21.734
THE SIGN BALLOT DESIGNED

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.102
ENVELOPES.

02:02:23.169 --> 02:02:25.137
CAN BE COPIED.

02:02:25.204 --> 02:02:26.605
SO WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.174
KNOWING THAT THEIR BALLOTS IN

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:29.709
THEIR SIGNATURES CAN BE COPIED

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:31.377
AND IN SMALL COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:02:31.444 --> 02:02:32.745
YOU CAN PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:35.047
WILL ONLY CREATE MORE DISTRUST.

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:37.049
AND RESULT IN IT MAKING IT MORE

02:02:37.116 --> 02:02:38.784
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:39.852
PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECTION.

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.153
THOSE ARE TWO EXAMPLES THANK YOU

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.923
VERY MUCH -- OTHER ANY OTHER

02:02:43.989 --> 02:02:45.691
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- I'M

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:47.126
SORRY CENTER OUR ROOM TO DO THAT

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:47.993
YOU'RE I MEAN THAT THAT SEEMS

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:51.330
LIKE A BIT OF A STRETCH RIGHT IN

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:51.964
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:52.732
INVOLVE.

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:54.433
GOV FRAUD THAT WOULD BE

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:57.870
PROSECUTABLE AND VERY PRETTY

02:02:57.937 --> 02:03:01.107
CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE LAW.

02:03:01.173 --> 02:03:02.575
TO TO PORTUGAL SIGNATURES AND IS

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:04.310
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THEY

02:03:04.376 --> 02:03:06.312
DON'T I AM I MISSING YOUR THAT

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:06.912
WE ARE SUGGESTING SIR TO THIS

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:07.880
YEAR.

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:09.048
WELL I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WAS

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:10.416
BUT I'M SORRY I WASN'T WHAT

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.084
EXAGGERATE WHY DON'T YOU CLARIFY

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.786
VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU WOULD.

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:15.387
BECAUSE THAT IS SO THAT'S IF

02:03:15.454 --> 02:03:17.156
THAT WERE THE CASE THAT WOULD BE

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:19.225
OF CONCERN.

02:03:19.291 --> 02:03:21.160
WE BELIEVE THAT JUST THE FACT OF

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.561
PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THAT THEIR

02:03:22.628 --> 02:03:24.864
SIGNATURES COULD BE COPIED -- I

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:27.099
UNDERSTAND.

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:28.334
AND PEOPLE'S CONCERN.

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.436
PRIVACY MATTERS EXCEPT FOR THAT

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:31.837
THAT WOULD RESULT IN FEWER

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:33.372
PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN AN

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:34.673
ELECTION SO.

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.742
IF WE MAY BE PERHAPS HAVE THE

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:39.512
SENATOR Y. KOWSKI RESPOND TO

02:03:39.578 --> 02:03:43.048
THOSE CONCERNS IN HIS CLOTHES.

02:03:43.115 --> 02:03:45.684
I WOULD LOVE TO WE THINK WE FIX

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:47.219
THE PROBLEM WE SAID THE COULDN'T

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.954
COPY THIS SIGNATURES THE

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:50.589
ELECTION MATERIALS WOULD BE

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:51.457
DIFFERENT.

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:53.092
TYPICALLY THEY'RE PUT ON THE

02:03:53.159 --> 02:03:54.794
WEBSITE SO PEOPLE CAN SEE WHAT.

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.427
THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING WHAT THE

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:57.062
GOING TO DO WITH THAT BUT I WILL

02:03:57.129 --> 02:03:58.764
CONTINUE TO WORK IF.

02:03:58.831 --> 02:03:59.899
WE THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE IS

02:03:59.965 --> 02:04:01.300
ENOUGH TO SAY YOU CAN'T COPY THE

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:03.435
SIGNATURES SO THAT WAS A CONCERN

02:04:03.502 --> 02:04:06.372
THAT PEOPLE MAY HAPPEN THAT --

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:07.840
THE MADAM CHAIR.

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:10.543
I WISH NOBODY A VETO MESSAGE

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:12.077
FROM THE GOVERNOR TO SAYS ONE

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:13.679
SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL BECAUSE

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:15.514
THEN YOU'RE PUT INTO IT

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:16.549
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE DEALING

02:04:16.615 --> 02:04:16.849
WITH.

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:19.051
DEMOCRACY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:04:19.118 --> 02:04:21.720
PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN ONE IN

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:22.822
FOR CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN THE

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:24.390
HOMEOWNERS IS A CESSATION SO I

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:25.624
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:27.193
VETO MESSAGE THAT A ONE SIZE

02:04:27.259 --> 02:04:28.894
DOESN'T FIT ALL WE'RE TALKING

02:04:28.961 --> 02:04:29.395
ABOUT.

02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:31.764
HAVING PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN A

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:33.766
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION NOT BEING

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:36.068
LEFT OUT FROM MAKING DECISIONS

02:04:36.135 --> 02:04:37.536
ON WHERE THEY LIVE THERE'S AN

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:39.071
UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF FOLKS

02:04:39.138 --> 02:04:40.673
THAT LIVE IN THESE ASSOCIATIONS

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:42.107
AND SOME OF THEM ARE JUST.

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:44.176
CUT OUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.078
RULES THE COUNTRY CLUB FOLKS SAY

02:04:46.145 --> 02:04:47.646
THESE ARE THE RULES AND WE'RE

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:48.147
NOT GONNA ALLOW YOU TO

02:04:48.214 --> 02:04:50.216

WELL RUN AND THEY REPRESENT AND

IT'S THE DAY THAT REPRESENTS HOW

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.005
FAR INTO THE NEXT YEAR.

02:08:33.072 --> 02:08:35.741
WOMEN MUST WORK. TO EARN WHAT

02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:37.342
MEN DID THE PRIOR YEAR

02:08:37.409 --> 02:08:37.643
[inaudible]

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:39.378
SO ESSENTIALLY.

02:08:39.445 --> 02:08:41.146
WHITE WOMEN IN PARTICULAR HAVE

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:43.348
WORKED THREE MONTHS TO RAGE THE

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:44.683
PAY THAT.

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:47.486
MEN HAVE RECEIVED AS OF DECEMBER

02:08:47.553 --> 02:08:49.555

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:50.389
SO I THINK IT'S FITTING WE'RE

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:53.192
HERE TODAY FOR THE PRESENTATION

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:54.993
OF A BILL THE CLOTHES THAT WAGE

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.595
GAP.

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:58.363
THIS IS -- THE WAGE GAP

02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:00.632
RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED

02:09:00.699 --> 02:09:01.600
SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.969
LOST WAGES FOR WOMEN IN

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:05.337
CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR.

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.405
SO.

02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:08.907
THINK ABOUT THAT NUMBER SEVENTY

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.843
EIGHT ACTUALLY POINT SIX BILLION

02:09:10.909 --> 02:09:11.844
DOLLARS.

02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:14.079
CLEARLY THE WAGE GAP HURTS WOMEN

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:17.649
pECONOMY.

02:09:17.716 --> 02:09:19.551
AND AGAIN THAT IS WHITE WOMEN

02:09:19.618 --> 02:09:22.321
WOMEN OF COLOR FARE EVEN WORSE

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:23.455
FOR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:25.390
SHE HAS TO WORK TILL AUGUST

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:28.160
TWENTY SECOND. TO MAKE WHAT

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.295
WHITE MEN HAD MADE IN THE PRIOR

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:31.463
YEAR.

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:33.198
AND FOR LATINOS.

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:34.833
THEY WORK UNTIL NOVEMBER. TO

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:36.335
MAKE WHAT.

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:39.538
MEN HAD MADE IN THE PRIOR YEAR --

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.874
AS AS HAS MENTIONED -- I'M

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.842
ACCEPTING THOSE AMENDMENTS --

02:09:43.909 --> 02:09:45.978
SPECIFICALLY THEY WILL CLARIFY

02:09:46.044 --> 02:09:47.980
THAT THE SUBMISSION OF THE

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:50.616
FEDERAL E. O. ONE REPORT. TO THE

02:09:50.682 --> 02:09:52.050
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.485
AND HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:09:53.552 --> 02:09:55.320
SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.555
THE BILL.

02:09:56.622 --> 02:09:58.557
SO LONG AS SAID EO ONE REPORT

02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:00.526
CONTAINS THE SAME OR

02:10:00.592 --> 02:10:02.961
SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR DATA.

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:05.164
THAT IS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:08.534
AND THE OBAMA -- FORM WHICH IS

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:10.669
THE BASIS OF THIS BILL DOES IN

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.272
FACT DO THAT -- IT'S ALSO ADDS

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.873
WE HAD A CLARIFYING AMENDMENT

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.375
REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF

02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:17.676
EMPLOYER.

02:10:17.743 --> 02:10:19.945
AS WELL AS SOME OTHER TECHNICAL

02:10:20.012 --> 02:10:20.779
CHANGES.

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:22.814
THIS MEASURE IS A BILL TO FIGHT

02:10:22.881 --> 02:10:25.150
PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:26.952
WITH INFORMATION.

02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:28.120
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY

02:10:28.187 --> 02:10:29.988
EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND MINORITIES

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:32.424
WE CANNOT FIX WHAT WE DO NOT

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:33.525
KNOW.

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:34.793
THIS MEASURE REQUIRES THAT

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.395
EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED

02:10:36.461 --> 02:10:38.597
EMPLOYEES OR MORE SUBMIT A PAY

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:40.899
DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE

02:10:40.966 --> 02:10:42.467
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

02:10:42.534 --> 02:10:43.635
AND HOUSING.

02:10:43.702 --> 02:10:46.038
OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AND

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:48.340
HOURS WORKED OF EMPLOYEES BY

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:49.608
GENDER.

02:10:49.675 --> 02:10:50.876
BY RACE.

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:54.780
BY ETHNICITY AND BY JOB CATEGORY.

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:55.948
THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD.

02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:58.217
FIRST TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:00.986
ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:03.222
AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION IN

02:11:03.288 --> 02:11:05.390
OTHER WORDS PUTTING A MIRROR IN

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:08.327
FRONT OF THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES.

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:10.462
BECAUSE I SUBMIT THAT MOST

02:11:10.529 --> 02:11:12.064
EMPLOYERS.

02:11:12.130 --> 02:11:14.233
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

02:11:14.299 --> 02:11:16.602
DISCRIMINATING AND DO NOT INTEND

02:11:16.668 --> 02:11:18.670
TO DISCRIMINATE I CANNOT IMAGINE

02:11:18.737 --> 02:11:20.005
AN EMPLOYER WAKING UP IN THE

02:11:20.072 --> 02:11:21.073
MORNING SAYING.

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:22.474
GOODNESS THIS MORNING I WANT TO

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:25.210
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN'S PAY.

02:11:25.277 --> 02:11:28.180
BUT THERE IS IMPLICIT BIAS THAT

02:11:28.247 --> 02:11:29.881
WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TO

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:32.217
IDENTIFY AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.585
BILL CALLS.

02:11:33.652 --> 02:11:35.320
FOR AND THE SECOND IS TO ALLOW

02:11:35.387 --> 02:11:36.655
THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

02:11:36.722 --> 02:11:38.657
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO GATHER

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:40.192
IMPORTANT DATA.

02:11:40.259 --> 02:11:42.594
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE PATTERNS

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:45.130
OF WAGE DISPARITIES IN JOB

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.365
CATEGORIES.

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:48.166
JOB CATEGORIES BECAUSE THAT'S

02:11:48.233 --> 02:11:49.868
WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR IT

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:53.105
DOESN'T PINPOINT -- EMPLOYEE A

02:11:53.171 --> 02:11:54.506
VERSUS EMPLOYEE BE.

02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:56.174
IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER

02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:57.242
OR NOT THESE PEOPLE ARE BEING

02:11:57.309 --> 02:11:59.344
PAID EQUALLY FOR SUBSTANTIALLY

02:11:59.411 --> 02:12:01.346
SIMILAR WORK WHAT IT DOES IS IT

02:12:01.413 --> 02:12:03.915
LOOKS IN VARIOUS JOB CTEGORIES.

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:06.151
SUCH AS A ADMINISTRATIVE

02:12:06.218 --> 02:12:07.219
ASSISTANT.

02:12:07.286 --> 02:12:10.389
SUCH AS MIDDLE MANAGER AND IF IT

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:12.391
SEES THAT EMITTED FOR

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:14.126
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS ARE

02:12:14.192 --> 02:12:15.394
80% WOMEN.

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:17.162
AND THAT THEY ARE IN THE LOWER

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:19.331
PAYING JOB CATEGORY IT WILL HELP

02:12:19.398 --> 02:12:20.832
THEM RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:23.402
DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:25.070
VARIOUS CATEGORIES.

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:27.105
SO IF THEY NOTICE DEVIATIONS OR

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:29.107
ALL LIARS IN ONE PARTICULAR

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:31.943
INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE ONLY

02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:35.247
15% OF YOUR HIGHER PAID WORKERS

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:36.481
ARE WOMEN.

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:38.083
THAT'S AN OUT LIAR AND IT WILL

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:40.018
ALLOW THEM TO DIG DEEPER INTO

02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:43.121
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS --

02:12:43.188 --> 02:12:45.390
DISCRIMINATION GOING ON IN THAT

02:12:45.457 --> 02:12:47.192
PARTICULAR -- UNLAWFUL

02:12:47.259 --> 02:12:49.328
DISCRIMINATION GOING ON IN

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:51.863
WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY

02:12:51.930 --> 02:12:53.265
OR BUSINESS SO.

02:12:53.332 --> 02:12:54.733
THE BILL IS MODELED CLOSELY

02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:57.169
AFTER EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE ON

02:12:57.235 --> 02:12:58.770
THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:01.406
RECOGNIZING THAT UNEQUAL PAY IS

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:04.076
OFTEN HIDDEN. TO EMPLOYERS AND

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:05.510
EMPLOYEES AS I'VE MENTIONED THE

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:07.646
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A

02:13:07.713 --> 02:13:09.381
PROPOSED REVISION TO A

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:11.249
DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:13.452
EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTING

02:13:13.518 --> 02:13:15.721
FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS.

02:13:15.787 --> 02:13:17.222
THE EO ONE FORM.

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:20.592
HAS BEEN IN USE FOR FIFTY YEARS

02:13:20.659 --> 02:13:22.327
THIS IS NOT A NEW FORM.

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:24.930
BUT WHAT WE WILL DO IS SIMPLY AT

02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:26.665
INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:27.766
DATA.

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:30.635
BY RACE AND GENDER BEGINNING.

02:13:30.702 --> 02:13:32.671
IN -- THE INTENT OF THE BILL

02:13:32.738 --> 02:13:34.539
ACTUALLY FEDERALLY WAS TO BEGIN

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:35.941
IN.

02:13:36.007 --> 02:13:37.109
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN THE TRUMP

02:13:37.175 --> 02:13:39.311
ADMINISTRATION CAME INTO --

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:43.215
OFFICE IT SIMPLY RENEGED ON THIS

02:13:43.281 --> 02:13:45.317
PROPOSAL NOW THIS WAS A THIS WAS

02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:47.219
A FORM THAT HAD BEEN SEVERAL

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:49.321
YEARS IN THE MAKING STAKEHOLDERS

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:51.089
FROM ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:53.258
WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER. TO TRY TO

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:55.227
COME UP WITH A FORM WHICH SIMPLY

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:58.029
ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY.

02:13:58.096 --> 02:14:00.866
WHETHER IN WHY AND HOW GENDER

02:14:00.932 --> 02:14:03.168
BASED DISCRIMINATION WAGE

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:05.570
DISCRIMINATION WAS TAKING PLACE

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:07.806
AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS BECAUSE

02:14:07.873 --> 02:14:09.674
WOMEN ARE MAKING LESS.

02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:12.944
THAN MALE COUNTERPARTS SO AUGUST

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:14.446
PULLED.

02:14:14.513 --> 02:14:17.315
IT THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW

02:14:17.382 --> 02:14:17.949
CENTER SHOOT.

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:19.284
ARGUING THAT THE OFFICE OF

02:14:19.351 --> 02:14:20.752
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET LACK COULD

02:14:20.819 --> 02:14:23.188
CAUSE TO STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:24.589
OF THIS MEASURE.

02:14:24.656 --> 02:14:26.825
THIS MONTH THIS PAST MONTH I

02:14:26.892 --> 02:14:28.226
SHOULD SAY A FEDERAL JUDGE

02:14:28.293 --> 02:14:30.462
ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:32.297
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH COLLECTING

02:14:32.364 --> 02:14:33.565
THIS IMPORTANT DATA.

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:36.301
CITING THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION

02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:38.370
STUDY AN IMPORT THE WENT INTO

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:39.938
THE CREATION OF THIS DATA

02:14:40.005 --> 02:14:41.239
REVISION.

02:14:41.306 --> 02:14:42.574
AND DECLARING THAT THE OFFICE OF

02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:44.810
MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET'S DECISION

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.111
TO HALT THE PROGRAM WAS

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:48.513
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS.

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.982
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE DECISION

02:14:51.049 --> 02:14:53.151
COULD BE APPEALED BUT NOT NONE

02:14:53.218 --> 02:14:54.719
THE LESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:14:54.786 --> 02:14:56.421
WE KNOW THAT THE COLLECTION OF

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:58.857
THE IDENTICAL PAY DATA REQUESTED

02:14:58.924 --> 02:15:00.959

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:04.362
MEASURE INSURERS THE DATA.

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:05.997
IS ALSO IN THE HANDS OF OUR

02:15:06.064 --> 02:15:09.267
STATE AGENCIES I THINK -- IT'S

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.936
WORTH NOTING THAT YESTERDAY I

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:12.971
WAS HONORED TO PARTICIPATE IN A

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:15.574

COMPANIES.

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:25.283
LARGE COMPANIES ANNOUNCED THEY

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:27.452
WERE PLEDGING TO DO THEIR OWN

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:30.555
ANNUAL -- COMPANY WIDE TO PAY

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:32.090
ANALYSIS.

02:15:32.157 --> 02:15:36.027
AND EIGHTEEN T. -- BEING BE A

02:15:36.094 --> 02:15:37.662
NUMBER OF LARGE COMPANY SAID YOU

02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:38.530
KNOW WHAT.

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:39.998
WE WANT TO LOOK TO SEE WE

02:15:40.065 --> 02:15:41.733
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE NOT

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.535
DISCRIMINATING BUT WE ARE GOING

02:15:43.602 --> 02:15:44.736
TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:47.372
BECAUSE IF WE ARE THEN WE WANT

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:48.940
TO CORRECT THAT PROBLEM.

02:15:49.007 --> 02:15:51.443
SO -- I AM DELIGHTED AND COMMEND

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:52.644
THESE COMPANIES FOR THEIR

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:54.279
LEADERSHIP BUT WE NEED THE SELF

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:56.515
EVALUATION AND SELF CORRECTION

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:57.616
TO BE SYSTEMIC.

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:59.651
IF WE HOPE TO CLOSE THE WAGE GAP

02:15:59.718 --> 02:16:00.986
ONCE AND FOR ALL THERE ARE

02:16:01.052 --> 02:16:02.420
ESTIMATES THAT SAY IF WE DON'T

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:06.091
START DOING THIS PRO ACTIVELY.

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:06.725
IT'S GOING TO BE A HUNDRED YEARS

02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.326
BEFORE WE END UP WITH EQUAL PAY

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:12.764
THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE -- SO.

02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:14.499
THE I LET ME JUST TAKE A COUPLE

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:16.501
MINUTES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.436
MISINFORMATION THAT IS OUT THERE

02:16:18.503 --> 02:16:20.872
TO KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT.

02:16:20.939 --> 02:16:23.074
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC

02:16:23.141 --> 02:16:24.175
SHAMING.

02:16:24.242 --> 02:16:26.144
IT WILL NOT EXPOSE INFORMATION

02:16:26.211 --> 02:16:28.346
THAT IS IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESS

02:16:28.413 --> 02:16:29.981
TO THE PUBLIC NOR WILL IT

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:31.616
EXPOSED EMPLOYEES PRIVATE

02:16:31.683 --> 02:16:33.685
FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:34.252
PUBLIC.

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:36.888
I'VE TAKEN -- AN UNUSUAL STEP

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:40.091
FOR ME -- AND PROHIBITED --

02:16:40.158 --> 02:16:41.960

TO CORRECT NOT TO SHAME.

02:16:47.132 --> 02:16:48.300
AND I THINK THAT IS A VERY

02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:50.802
IMPORTANT CRITERIA.

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:52.003
THE LIMITING A PUBLIC

02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:53.638
AVAILABILITY OF THE REPORTS IS

02:16:53.705 --> 02:16:54.973
SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURS AT THE

02:16:55.040 --> 02:16:57.175
FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE

02:16:57.242 --> 02:16:59.144

FIFTY YEARS THAT IT HAS BEEN --

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:05.183
REQUIRED CENSUS FORM HAS BEEN

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:08.286
REQUIRED THE DATA WILL PROVIDE A

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:09.588
BIRD'S-EYE VIEW ONE PAY

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.056
DISPARITIES IN OCCUPATIONAL

02:17:11.122 --> 02:17:13.224
SEGREGATION BUT IT DOESN'T GO

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:16.294
DEEP IN AN ATTEMPT TO COMPARE

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:17.629
ONE PERSON'S SALARY VERSUS

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:19.064
ANOTHER.

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:21.399
WE HAVE THE FAIR PAY ACT WHICH

02:17:21.466 --> 02:17:24.035
WILL LOOK AT THE SUBSTANTIALLY

02:17:24.102 --> 02:17:26.571
SIMILAR WORK TO IDENTIFY WHETHER

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:28.440
PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID THIS LOOKS

02:17:28.506 --> 02:17:30.909
A JOB CATEGORIES.

CORRECT ANY KIND OF JOB A GENDER

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:38.617
DISCRIMINATION THAT EXISTS IN

02:17:38.683 --> 02:17:42.287
OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES -- SO

02:17:42.354 --> 02:17:45.090
WITH THAT -- HI THIS IS AN

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:46.691
IMPORTANT MEASURE TO TRUST

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:50.362
SIMPLY IDENTIFY WHERE WE ARE

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:52.230
WHERE WE HAVE GONE ASTRAY -- AND

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.999
TO CORRECTED AND TO DO SO IN A

02:17:54.065 --> 02:17:56.468
WAY -- HOPEFULLY WHERE COMPANIES

02:17:56.534 --> 02:17:58.603
WILL VLUNTARILY MAKE THOSE

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.271
CORRECTIONS WE DO HAVE THIRTEEN

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.973
COMPANIES THAT ALREADY STEPPED

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.577
UP. TO DO THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE --

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:07.812
REPLICATED THROUGHOUT OUR STATE

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:09.781
SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:10.649
SEVENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

02:18:10.715 --> 02:18:12.017
THAT'S LEFT ON THE TABLE THAT

02:18:12.083 --> 02:18:13.818
WOULD OTHERWISE GO INTO OUR

02:18:13.885 --> 02:18:15.320
LOCAL ECONOMY FOR THE GOODS IN

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:18.156
THE SERVICES THAT FAMILIES NEED.

02:18:24.896 --> 02:18:25.930
SO WITH THAT I HAD TO WITNESSES

02:18:25.997 --> 02:18:27.332

WONDERFUL -- MEMBERS AMERICA

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:40.845
YOUR SHE HARD WITH THE

02:18:40.912 --> 02:18:42.313
CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:43.882
ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD CO

02:18:43.948 --> 02:18:46.317
SPONSORS OF SB.

02:18:46.384 --> 02:18:46.951
ONE SEVENTY ONE I JUST WANT TO

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:48.753
EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:50.488
THIS DATA WILL PROVIDE A NO THE

02:18:50.555 --> 02:18:51.923
OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT IS THAT

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:52.757
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THESE

02:18:52.824 --> 02:18:53.658
REPORTS ARE GOING TO MAKE IT

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:54.926
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE EQUAL PACKED

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.294
VIOLATIONS WOULD REALLY NOT

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:58.063
EXIST BECAUSE IT WON'T ALLOW.

02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:59.130
THESE REPORTS ONE ALLOW FOR

02:18:59.197 --> 02:19:00.465
THOSE BONA FIDE FACTORS THAT

02:19:00.532 --> 02:19:01.766
COULD JUSTIFY.

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:03.668
A WAGE DISPARITY BUT I THINK

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:04.836
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAY

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.805
DISCRIMINATION REALLY IS NOT

02:19:06.871 --> 02:19:08.640
JUST ABOUT COMPARING EMPLOYEE A

02:19:08.707 --> 02:19:10.175
WHO IS A WOMAN VERSES EMPLOYEE

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:11.843
BE WHO'S A MAN.

02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:13.445
DOING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK

02:19:13.511 --> 02:19:14.546
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THIS

02:19:14.612 --> 02:19:15.914
ISSUE OF OCCUPATIONAL

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:17.382
SEGREGATION AND HOW OTHERS

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.317
HIRING PRACTICES AND PATTERNS

02:19:19.384 --> 02:19:20.618
THAT RESULT IN WOMEN AND PEOPLE

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:21.419
OF COLOR.

02:19:21.486 --> 02:19:22.787
SYSTEMICALLY BEING PAID LESS

02:19:22.854 --> 02:19:24.689
OVERALL OR BEING OVER

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:26.124
REPRESENTED OVER CONCENTRATED

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:29.094
AND LOWER LOWER PAID JOBS -- SO

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.462
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN COMPANIES

02:19:30.528 --> 02:19:32.564
LIKE SALES FORCE THE GAPS

02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.566
STARBUCKS DO THESE PAY AUDITS

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:36.201
VOLUNTARILY AND IT HAS ALLOWED

02:19:36.267 --> 02:19:38.269
THEM TO YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:40.405
WAYS JUST DISTRIBUTIONS ARE WHAT

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:42.140
THE WAGE PATTERNS ARE.

02:19:42.207 --> 02:19:47.879
AND AND FIGURE OUT OUR WOMEN AND

02:19:47.946 --> 02:19:48.813
PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING.

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.380
OVERLY REPRESENTED IN THESE

02:19:49.447 --> 02:19:50.014
LOWER PAID JOBS AND 80% OF ALL

02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:51.049
WAGES ARE GOING TO A HANDFUL OF

02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:52.183
WHITE MEN.

02:19:52.250 --> 02:19:53.218
AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE'S

02:19:53.284 --> 02:19:54.953
AN EQUAL PAY VIOLATION NOT

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:56.254
NECESSARILY BUT IT DOES MEAN

02:19:56.321 --> 02:19:57.422
THAT THOSE COMPANIES SHOULD BE

02:19:57.489 --> 02:19:58.590
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE

02:19:58.656 --> 02:20:00.091
RECRUITMENT ARE HIRING THE

02:20:00.158 --> 02:20:01.659
PROMOTION PRACTICES.

02:20:01.726 --> 02:20:02.627
TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

02:20:02.694 --> 02:20:04.796
WHY IT THOSE PATTERNS EXIST AND

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:07.031
WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER -- THREE

02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:08.933
YEARS AGO THIS WEEK THE DAY

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.703
AFTER EQUAL PAYDAY -- THERE WAS

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.271
NEARLY THREE HUNDRED FEMALE

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:14.739
ATTORNEYS WHO SETTLED ONE OF THE

02:20:14.806 --> 02:20:16.241
LARGEST PAY DISCRIMINATION CASES

02:20:16.307 --> 02:20:17.675
AGAINST FARMERS INSURANCE.

02:20:17.742 --> 02:20:19.811
AND FARMERS INSURANCE USED A PAY

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.379
GRADING SYSTEM WHERE THE

02:20:21.446 --> 02:20:23.248
ATTORNEYS MADE BETWEEN GRADE

02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:25.850
THIRTY SIX AND FORTY AND IN

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:26.885
THROUGH THIS LITIGATION THEY

02:20:26.951 --> 02:20:28.086
TOOK A THEY WERE ABLE TO GO

02:20:28.153 --> 02:20:29.921
HIGHER LEVEL LOOK AT THIS PAY

02:20:29.988 --> 02:20:31.523
DATA AND THEY FOUND THAT.

02:20:31.589 --> 02:20:33.024
MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO CAME IN

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:35.059
CAME IN AT GREAT THIRTY SIX MOST

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:36.628
OF THE MEN THAT CAME IN CAME IN

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:37.896
AT GREAT.

02:20:37.962 --> 02:20:38.763
THIRTY SEVEN THAT WOMEN WERE

02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:40.231
NINE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE IN A

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:42.367
LOWER PAY GRADE TO THE MEN AND

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:43.601
THAT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE THAT

02:20:43.668 --> 02:20:46.271
THE PAY GRADE ITSELF WOMEN WERE.

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.472
DISPROPORTIONATELY AT THE BOTTOM

02:20:47.539 --> 02:20:49.340
AND OF THE PAY GRADE AND MEN

02:20:49.407 --> 02:20:50.074
WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT THE

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:51.709
TOP AND SO THAT'S THE KIND OF

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:53.077
HIGH LEVEL PAY DATA THAT THESE

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.279
REPORTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:20:54.345 --> 02:20:55.446
PROVIDE.

02:20:55.513 --> 02:20:56.314
JUST THE OTHER THING THE

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:57.649
DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT HOUSING

02:20:57.715 --> 02:20:59.684
WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

02:20:59.751 --> 02:21:02.053
TRENDS WITHIN AND ACROSS

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:03.521
INDUSTRIES SO HOW DO WAY AGE

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:04.923
PATTERNS IN THE TECH SECTOR

02:21:04.989 --> 02:21:06.925
COMPARED TO WAGE PATTERNS IN THE

02:21:06.991 --> 02:21:08.126
HEALTHCARE SECTOR.

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.661

JOBS WHO HOLDS THE LOWEST PAYING

02:21:10.728 --> 02:21:14.265
JOBS WHICH WILL ALLOW US?

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:15.233
TO CREATE SOME POTENTIAL POLICY

02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.501
INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE

02:21:16.568 --> 02:21:18.636

SEGREGATION'S WHERE THEY MAY

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.171
EXIST.

02:21:43.061 --> 02:21:43.828
BUT WHEN NUMBER WE DON'T TALK

02:21:43.895 --> 02:21:45.864
QUITE A BIT AS MUCH ABOUT IS

02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:48.766
THAT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.301
HOW MUCH.

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:52.036
OF THE PAY DISPARITY IS TO

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:55.139
OUTRIGHT BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION.

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.474
AND AS THE SENATOR SAID THERE'S

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:58.243
PROBABLY NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE TO

02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:59.510
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING SAFE.

02:21:59.577 --> 02:22:01.079
DAMMIT I'M GOING TO DISCRIMINATE

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:02.847
AGAINST WOMEN TODAY.

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:04.682
IT'S 6212%.

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:08.887
SO THAT'S 8294% OF EMPLOYERS

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:10.922
AREN'T INTENDING. TO

02:22:10.989 --> 02:22:12.423
DISCRIMINATE IT LIKELY IS

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:15.326
PERPETUATION OF STATUS QUO.

02:22:15.393 --> 02:22:16.594
BECAUSE WE HAVE LOOKED AT THINGS

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:18.062
LET ME GIVE YOU A REALLY BRIEF

02:22:18.129 --> 02:22:19.697
ANALOGY IN TERMS OF THE POWER OF

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:20.999
DATA MOST OF YOU HAVE HEARD

02:22:21.065 --> 02:22:22.600
ABOUT.

02:22:22.667 --> 02:22:24.335
THE NUMBERS OF MATERNAL DEATHS.

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:25.470
AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IN

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:27.639
CALIFORNIA REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:28.940
MATERNAL DEATHS BY MORE THAN

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:31.042
HALF.

02:22:31.109 --> 02:22:32.577
IN A HANDFUL OF YEARS BECAUSE OF

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.479
DATA.

02:22:34.545 --> 02:22:36.447
WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE FOUND OUT

02:22:36.514 --> 02:22:38.283
40% OF HOSPITALS DIDN'T HAVE A

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:39.751
HEMORRHAGE PROTOCOL IN PLACE.

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:40.685
THAT WAS NUMBER ONE LEADING

02:22:40.752 --> 02:22:43.454
CAUSE OF DEATH IT'S NOW NUMBER.

02:22:43.521 --> 02:22:45.757
THREE WE'RE SIX OUT OF A HUNDRED

02:22:45.823 --> 02:22:46.991
THOUSAND WOMEN DIE IN CHILDBIRTH

02:22:47.058 --> 02:22:48.092
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:22:48.159 --> 02:22:50.862
THE US IS ABOUT 25% THAT'S

02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:53.498
BECAUSE WE MADE THE DECISION. TO

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:55.199
USE DATA TO LOOK AT THIS.

02:22:55.266 --> 02:22:56.901
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE A VERY

02:22:56.968 --> 02:22:59.604
MINIMAL IMPACT FOR EMPLOYERS.

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:00.772
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEY TOOK

02:23:00.838 --> 02:23:02.840
GREAT CARE TO LOOK AT WHAT IT

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:03.341
WAS GOING.

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:05.076
TO TAKE FOR EMPLOYERS TO

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:07.312
IMPLEMENT THIS AND I BELIEVE I

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:08.579
MIGHT BE A FEW CENTS OFF BELIEVE

02:23:08.646 --> 02:23:11.482
BELIEVE IT'S AN ADDITIONAL FOUR

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:13.251
HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS.

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:14.819

ADD THIS VALUABLE DATA THIS

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:18.756

HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS BEFORE WE

02:23:31.336 --> 02:23:32.537

IS KEPT IN THE BILL THAT WERE

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:38.336
NEGOTIATED LAST YEAR HOWEVER WE

02:24:38.403 --> 02:24:39.737

FORM HOWEVER AGAIN THIS IS

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.348
SOMETHING THAT IS STILL

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:52.817
CONCERNING TO S. OF ONE BECAUSE

02:24:52.884 --> 02:24:53.951
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.486
DID SUPPORT THE EQUAL PAY ACT

02:24:55.553 --> 02:24:56.921
WHEN IT WAS SIGNED BY THE

02:24:56.988 --> 02:24:57.188
GOVERNOR.

02:24:57.255 --> 02:24:59.490
AND WE DO A A SUPPORT THE IN A

WEEK WILL PAY IN GENERAL AND

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.493
THAT IS UNLAWFUL AND WHEN THERE

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.796
IS UNLAWFUL WAGE DISPARITY.

02:25:04.862 --> 02:25:06.731
AND WHILE THE INTENT OF THIS

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:07.799
BILL IS TO COLLECT AGGREGATE

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:09.400
DATA THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF THE

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:10.601
EQUAL PAY ACT WAS TO ACTUALLY

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:12.904
COMPARE JOBS IT'S A JOBS.

02:25:12.970 --> 02:25:15.039
THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:17.075
TO EACH OTHER RATHER THAN SIMPLY

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:19.010
CATEGORICAL JOB TITLES AND SO

02:25:19.077 --> 02:25:20.645
OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT YOU WANT

02:25:20.711 --> 02:25:22.780
TO HAVE WAGE DISPARITY YOU WANT

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:24.082
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOMEONE

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:25.550
THAT HAS BEEN WITH YOUR COMPANY

02:25:25.616 --> 02:25:26.117
FOR THIRTY YEARS.

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:27.652
MORE PAY VERSUS SOMEONE THAT HAS

02:25:27.718 --> 02:25:29.153
ONLY BEEN THERE FOR TWO WEEKS

02:25:29.220 --> 02:25:30.254
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.556
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THAT

02:25:31.622 --> 02:25:32.890
ADDITIONALLY THE COMPANIES THAT

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.358
HAVE PLEDGED TO DO THIS HAVE

02:25:34.425 --> 02:25:35.326
DONE THIS ON THEIR OWN.

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:36.894
AND THAT'S PART OF THE EQUAL PAY

02:25:36.961 --> 02:25:38.463
ACT THAT'S CURRENTLY THE LOSS OF

02:25:38.529 --> 02:25:39.964
COMPANIES ARE TAKING A DEEP DIVE

02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:41.299
THEY ARE TAKING A LOOK ATTHEIR

02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:43.000
CURRENT PAY PRACTICES WE WANT

02:25:43.067 --> 02:25:44.735
THAT TO CONTINUE BUT WHY NOT

02:25:44.802 --> 02:25:46.471
INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO DO THAT.

02:25:46.537 --> 02:25:47.872
THIS IS THEIR INFORMATION THEY

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:49.674
HAVE THE INFORMATION IT'S NOT

02:25:49.740 --> 02:25:51.375
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE YOU

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:52.777
YOU CAN'T KNOW UNTIL YOU FARM

02:25:52.844 --> 02:25:53.911
AND WHAT YOU DON'T SEE.

02:25:53.978 --> 02:25:55.179
IT'S THEIR INFORMATION SO AS

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:56.681
LONG AS THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT

02:25:56.747 --> 02:25:57.982
THEY CAN DO THAT AND SO

02:25:58.049 --> 02:26:00.017
CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW WE DO

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:00.585
UNDERSTAND THAT THE FEDERAL

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:01.919
GOVERNMENT.

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:03.187
HAS OR THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE

02:26:03.254 --> 02:26:06.224
NOW REINSTATED THE EO ONE PAID

02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:07.992
AT A REQUIREMENT WE ARE UNDER

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:09.527
THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT WILL BE

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:11.195
APPEALED HOWEVER IF IT'S NOT.

02:26:11.262 --> 02:26:12.497
THEN THAT INFORMATION SHOULD GO

02:26:12.563 --> 02:26:13.664
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH

02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:15.032
DOES HAVE DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:19.537
AND DIFFERENT STANDARDS AGAIN

02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:20.705
THIS IS A NEW NATIONAL

02:26:20.771 --> 02:26:21.372
POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL REPORTING

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:22.039
REQUIREMENT BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE

02:26:22.106 --> 02:26:22.673
IN THE BILL INCLUDING THE FACT

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.274
THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:24.575
AGREED UPON TODAY TO BE TAKEN.

02:26:24.642 --> 02:26:26.077
THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:27.011
SIMILAR WHICH MEANS THE

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:28.346
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

02:26:28.412 --> 02:26:29.847
COULD MAKE -- INTERPRET THEIR

02:26:29.914 --> 02:26:31.582
OWN REQUIREMENTS INTERPRET THIS

02:26:31.649 --> 02:26:33.117
BILL TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE E.

02:26:33.184 --> 02:26:34.685
A ONE REPORT ITSELF THE YOU

02:26:34.752 --> 02:26:36.821
COULD HAVE TO STILL COMPLY WITH

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:37.321
TWO DIFFERENT REPORTING

02:26:37.388 --> 02:26:38.256
REQUIREMENTS.

02:26:38.322 --> 02:26:39.891
BASED ON CALIFORNIA LAW AND THEN

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.959
BASED ON FEDERAL LAW AND FINALLY

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:43.494
OUR CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS BILL

02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:45.196
IS PREMATURE GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:26:45.263 --> 02:26:46.731
THE PAY EQUITY TAX FORCES NOT

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:47.899
COME OUT WITH THEIR

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:49.967
RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS POINT

02:26:50.034 --> 02:26:51.002
AND SO FOR THAT.

02:26:51.068 --> 02:26:52.036
PURPOSE WE FEEL THAT IT SHOULD

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:54.205
BE -- PENDING DEPENDING ON WHAT

02:26:54.272 --> 02:26:56.307
THE EO ONE POLICY ADD TURNS OUT

02:26:56.374 --> 02:26:57.842
ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THEN

02:26:57.909 --> 02:26:58.643
ALSO DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT

02:26:58.709 --> 02:27:01.612
REPORT SAYS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE

02:27:01.679 --> 02:27:04.415
APPRECIATE THE TIME.

02:27:04.482 --> 02:27:06.284

THAT THIS BILL IS PATTERNED

02:27:24.702 --> 02:27:26.637
AFTER THE FEDERAL LAW AND NOTED

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:27.772

WAS SUGGESTED IN THE PRIOR

IT'S ONLY GOING TO THE

DEPARTMENT OF FROM WOMEN HOUSING

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:59.583

02:31:17.501 --> 02:31:19.203
SOME DATABASE.

02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:20.905
THE BILL ITSELF DOESN'T GO

02:31:20.971 --> 02:31:22.673
THROUGH THAT NEXT STEP OF WHAT

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:24.408
HAPPENS AFTER COLLECTING BECAUSE

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:25.810
I THINK AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW

02:31:25.876 --> 02:31:26.677
WE'RE JUST.

02:31:26.744 --> 02:31:28.212
THE FOCUS IS ON ACTUALLY HAVING

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:30.214
THE COMPANY'S COMPILE THE DATA

02:31:30.281 --> 02:31:31.715
AND LOOK AT THE DATA THEMSELVES.

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:33.184
SO WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE TO THAT

02:31:33.250 --> 02:31:35.586
NEXT STEP IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

02:31:35.653 --> 02:31:36.720
DIP DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT

02:31:36.787 --> 02:31:39.857
HOUSING GOING TO DO IN TERMS OF

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:41.792
CREATING REPORTS AGGREGATING

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:42.526
DATA.

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:44.261
BUT REALLY IT'S LOOKING LOOKING

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:45.696
AT THE REPORT ITSELF AND JUST

02:31:45.763 --> 02:31:46.831
SEEING WHETHER THERE ARE

02:31:46.897 --> 02:31:49.200
PATTERNS THAT WARRANT.

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:51.168
FURTHER SCRUTINY.

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:52.937
AND IF IT IF THEY SEE I'M SORRY

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:55.539
VENTURETHE THE THE INITIAL

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.675
COMPILATION IS GOING TO BE

02:31:57.741 --> 02:32:00.277
SECTOR WIDE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.980
IDENTIFYING A PARTICULAR COMPANY.

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:04.682
THE FIRST MEASURE IS TO SEE

02:32:04.748 --> 02:32:05.783
WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:07.585
SECTORS WHERE.

02:32:07.651 --> 02:32:09.620
WE SEE A GREATER DISCRIMINATION

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:13.858
AN OCCUPATION -- AND AND THEN --

02:32:13.924 --> 02:32:15.459
YOU KNOW KIND OF GO FROM THERE

02:32:15.526 --> 02:32:16.994
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:32:17.061 --> 02:32:19.663
RESOLVE THE YOU KNOW THOSE

02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:22.433
DISPARITIES AND TRY -- TO GET

02:32:22.500 --> 02:32:26.437
COMPLIANCE -- BUT THERE'S NO.

02:32:26.504 --> 02:32:29.740
SORT OF MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT IS

02:32:29.807 --> 02:32:32.243
GOING TO BE IMPOSED -- AS WE TRY

02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:34.812
TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE WHERE THE

02:32:34.879 --> 02:32:36.180
GREATER DISPARITIES ARE.

02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:37.915
IS EXCESSIVE BOWL BY LITIGANTS

02:32:37.982 --> 02:32:40.050
SO FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE FILES A

02:32:40.117 --> 02:32:41.685
FEE HOW CLAIM IT IS AN

02:32:41.752 --> 02:32:43.888
INFORMATIONAL INFORMATION

02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:45.890
ACCESSIBLE BY LITIGANTS.

02:32:45.956 --> 02:32:47.625
AT THIS POINT THE ONLY LITIGANTS

02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:50.327
ARE FISHHAWK REMEMBER WITH WE'RE

02:32:50.394 --> 02:32:51.896
NOT TALKING ABOUT.

02:32:51.962 --> 02:32:53.297
PAGES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:55.232
PAY DISCRIMINATION WE'RE TALKING

02:32:55.299 --> 02:32:56.133
ABOUT.

02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:57.668
JOB SEGREGATION THEY'RE

02:32:57.735 --> 02:32:59.503
DIFFERENT ISSUES WHICH I KNOW

02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:00.204
THE CHAMBER KEEPS TRYING TO

02:33:00.271 --> 02:33:01.138
CONFLATE.

02:33:01.205 --> 02:33:03.774
BUT THE EQUAL PAY LAW IS VERY

02:33:03.841 --> 02:33:05.709
DIFFERENT IT COMPARES AND ONE

02:33:05.776 --> 02:33:08.646
EMPLOYEE VERSUS ANOTHER BASED

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:10.648
UPON THE SAME OR SIMILAR -- A

02:33:10.714 --> 02:33:15.286
JOB OF RESPONSIBILITIES -- THIS

02:33:15.352 --> 02:33:18.422
LOOKS AT MAJOR CATEGORIES SO IF

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:20.124
YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS IS THE

02:33:20.190 --> 02:33:21.559
THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL WE'RE

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:23.527
NOT DOWN AT THE MICROSCOPIC

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:25.462
LEVEL BUT BUT BUT FOR EXAMPLE

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:27.164
LET'S SAY FILE A CLAIM ON BEHALF

02:33:27.231 --> 02:33:28.098
OF SOMEONE ALLEGING.

02:33:28.165 --> 02:33:31.101
DISCRIMINATION PAY OR STATUS

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:32.836
WHATEVER IT MAY BE CAN I GET

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:36.473
ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BY

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:37.875
COMPANY.

02:33:37.942 --> 02:33:38.609
SO.

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:39.276
ALL RIGHT SO I SAID THE GRANITE

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:39.944
OR HOW DO I GET THAT INFORMATION

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:41.412
IT WOULD AND THESE ARE

02:33:41.478 --> 02:33:42.646
NEGOTIATIONS WE HAD LAST YEAR

02:33:42.713 --> 02:33:44.181
WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WELL THAT

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:45.716
THE NORMAL RULES OF DISCOVERY DO

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:48.385
APPLY SO AND THESE EO ONE

02:33:48.452 --> 02:33:49.320
REPORTS.

02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:50.955
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THEY'RE IN

02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:53.123
THE MIDST OF BEING REVISED BUT

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:55.059
HAVE FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS

02:33:55.125 --> 02:33:56.760
PROVIDED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:58.195
AND THOSE A YEAR ONE REPORTS

02:33:58.262 --> 02:34:00.631
HAVE BEEN DISCOVERABLE ALREADY

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:02.032
FOR DECADES NOW.

02:34:02.099 --> 02:34:03.934
SO IT WOULD JUST FOLLOW THE THE

02:34:04.001 --> 02:34:06.437
SAME RULES AS AS IT HAS EXISTED

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:07.538
FOR DECADES THAT IT WOULD BE

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:09.473
DISCOVER DISCOVER BLUES DOESN'T

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.342
ADD ANY NEW LEVEL OF

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:12.376
ACCESSIBILITY.

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:13.811
ALL RIGHT WELL IT DOESN'T APPLY

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:14.979
TO PUBLIC ENTITIES RIGHT ONLY

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:17.615
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THERE ARE.

02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:21.318
AT THE END ONLY FOR PROFIT ARE

02:34:21.385 --> 02:34:22.519
ALSO NOT FOR PROFIT.

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.288
IT DOES NOT.

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:26.123
NO IT DOESN'T SPECIFY COMPANIES

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:28.425
ONE HUNDRED MORE EMPLOYEES AGAIN.

02:34:28.492 --> 02:34:30.761
AGAIN REMEMBERING THAT THE THE

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:32.496
THE REAL PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO

02:34:32.563 --> 02:34:34.031
GET THE COMPANY TO DO A SELF

02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:37.768
EVALUATION AND TO CORRECT.

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:39.903
AT THAT POINT TIME IF AT AND

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:41.338
THEN TO PROVIDE THE DATA.

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:44.008
IF A COMPANY SELF EVALUATION

02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:45.542
CORRECTS WERE DONE.

02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:47.678
IF IN LOOKING AT THIS THERE ARE

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:50.748
SECTORS WHERE THERE IS REAL

02:34:50.814 --> 02:34:53.317
SUBSTANTIAL DISCRIMINATION.

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:55.152
THE AT THE D. FBIHAT LEAST AS

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.754
WE ENVISION IT WILL HAVE THE

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.689
OPPORTUNITY TO DIVE A LITTLE BIT

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.924
DEEPER TO FIND OUT WHY.

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.259
AND AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT

02:35:02.326 --> 02:35:04.094
THERE COULD BE ABSOLUTELY

02:35:04.161 --> 02:35:06.463
PERFECTLY GOOD REASONS -- THAT

02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:08.198
THE EMPLOYEE THAT TAT THAT THAT

02:35:08.265 --> 02:35:09.566
IT'S COMPANIES BEEN IN BUSINESS

02:35:09.633 --> 02:35:10.901
SINCE EIGHT THIRTY YEARS.

02:35:10.968 --> 02:35:13.103
AND THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE OF

02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:14.104
THOSE THIRTY YEARS THEY HAVEN'T

02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:16.440
EXPANDED SO THE SAME EMPLOYEES

02:35:16.507 --> 02:35:18.175
OF THEIR THEY TEND.

02:35:18.242 --> 02:35:20.277
TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE MALE --

02:35:20.344 --> 02:35:22.579
AND THAT WHEN THEY BRING IN NEW

02:35:22.646 --> 02:35:23.814
EMPLOYEES SHOULD SAY THEY BRING

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:25.349
IN SOME FEMALE EMPLOYEES BUT

02:35:25.416 --> 02:35:26.684
BECAUSE THE MALE EMPLOYEES HAVE

02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:28.485
BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS

02:35:28.552 --> 02:35:30.087
HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE AT CETERA

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:31.822
WHICH ARE ALL LEGITIMATE.

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:35.359
BASIS UPON WHICH PAY CAN BE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:36.260
DISPARATE.

02:35:36.326 --> 02:35:38.228
THEN YOU'RE DONE THERE AS WELL.

02:35:38.295 --> 02:35:40.297
BUT IF THEY'RE IF AS THEY LOOK

02:35:40.364 --> 02:35:44.168
AT THIS THEY DISCOVERED THAT.

02:35:44.234 --> 02:35:46.270
SAID THERE IS SEVERE

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:49.273
DISCRIMINATION HI AND PEOPLE ARE

02:35:49.339 --> 02:35:50.808
WHITE MEN AND ARE BEING PAID

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.443
MORE AND THE WOMEN ARE IN THE

02:35:52.509 --> 02:35:53.977
LOWER PAYING JOBS AT BIG SUR

02:35:54.044 --> 02:35:55.979
QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO

02:35:56.046 --> 02:35:57.014
TRY.

02:35:57.081 --> 02:35:59.783
TO REDUCE THAT DISPARITY.

02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:02.486
HIRE MORE PEOPLE PROMOTE THEM IT

02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:06.123
AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO GET. TO

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:08.625
CLOSE THE GAP NOT TO SUE PEOPLE

02:36:08.692 --> 02:36:10.561
BUT THAT BUT THAT IS AVAILABLE

02:36:10.627 --> 02:36:12.062
AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDER THE

02:36:12.129 --> 02:36:12.996
EO.

02:36:13.063 --> 02:36:14.098
ONE GOLD MY IGNORANCE FOR ONE

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.599
SECOND IS THERE A PUBLIC SECTOR

02:36:15.666 --> 02:36:17.034
EQUIVALENT OF THIS SO FOR

02:36:17.101 --> 02:36:19.269
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW PAY DISPARITY.

02:36:19.336 --> 02:36:20.337
ISN'T JUST.

02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:23.107
OF RESERVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO

02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:24.942
IF IF.

02:36:25.008 --> 02:36:26.910
MY YEAH IT'S PUBLIC INFORMATION

02:36:26.977 --> 02:36:29.346
PUBLIC PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THEIR

02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:31.081
INFORMATION IS PUBLIC WE CAN GO

02:36:31.148 --> 02:36:32.483
AND FIND OUT WHAT EVERYBODY IN

02:36:32.549 --> 02:36:34.651
THIS BUILDING IS PAID BECAUSE IT

02:36:34.718 --> 02:36:35.285
IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC

02:36:35.352 --> 02:36:36.420
KNOWLEDGE.

02:36:36.487 --> 02:36:38.355
WHERE AS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:36:38.422 --> 02:36:40.724
THERE'S NO OBLIGATION TO REPORT

02:36:40.791 --> 02:36:42.025
THAT INFORMATION BUT?

02:36:42.092 --> 02:36:43.393
OKAY I'M SORRY.

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:44.328
WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE COMMENT

02:36:44.394 --> 02:36:45.729
ACTUALLY THERE WAS AN ARTICLE

02:36:45.796 --> 02:36:47.397
TODAY ABOUT THE MILITARY.

02:36:47.464 --> 02:36:48.298
AND THE ONE OF THE BENEFITS

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:49.833
ABOUT THE MILITARY IF YOU CAN

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:50.968
PULL UP ALL OF THE DATA AND YOU

02:36:51.034 --> 02:36:52.436
CAN SEE AND YOU YOU SEE THAT

02:36:52.503 --> 02:36:53.804
THERE'S NOT A PAY DISPARITY.

02:36:53.871 --> 02:36:55.472
BETWEEN THE GENDERS SO I THOUGHT

02:36:55.539 --> 02:36:56.073
YOU WOULD IN PARTICULAR WOULD

02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:56.874
APPRECIATE.

02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:58.041
THAT WELL THERE IS A PAY

02:36:58.108 --> 02:36:59.977
DISPARITY MY WIFE ALWAYS WAS ONE

02:37:00.043 --> 02:37:01.211
RANK ABOVE ME ONLY BECAUSE I WAS

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.413
SMARTER BETTER LEADER AND THEY

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:04.815
DISCRIMINATE ON THAT BASIS.

02:37:04.882 --> 02:37:06.683
BUT SHE WAS ON SHE WAS AT A

02:37:06.750 --> 02:37:08.552
HIGHER GRADE LEVEL RIGHT SO IT'S

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:10.454
EQUAL PAY DISPARITY THAT WAS

02:37:10.521 --> 02:37:12.189
MENTIONED IS WHEN THEY'RE YOU'RE

02:37:12.256 --> 02:37:13.624
BOTH ON THE SAME LEVEL.

02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:15.025
THAT'S ACTIONABLE.

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:16.293
THAT WAS TO THE EQUAL PAY LAW

02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:17.528
BUT BUT THE QUESTION THE

02:37:17.594 --> 02:37:19.229
QUESTION IS IS THAT I GET YOUR

02:37:19.296 --> 02:37:20.764
POINT THAT YOU CAN IF YOU WANT

02:37:20.831 --> 02:37:21.965
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATE OF

02:37:22.032 --> 02:37:22.833
CALIFORNIA.

02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:24.201
AND IF YOU'VE GOT THE TIME

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.335
ENERGY.

02:37:25.402 --> 02:37:27.371
AND INTEREST YOU CAN LOOK AT THE

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:28.806
TORN FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:30.374
AND SEE AND DO THE SAME KIND OF

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:32.509
BREAK UP OUR PUBLIC SECTOR.

02:37:32.576 --> 02:37:34.945
ENTITIES REQUIRED TO COMPILE IT

02:37:35.012 --> 02:37:37.881
SO THIS IS MORE ACCESSIBLE.

02:37:37.948 --> 02:37:38.749
AND AND NOT I'M NOT TALKING

02:37:38.816 --> 02:37:40.884
ABOUT PER SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT SO

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:45.289
YOU CAN DO THE SAME KIND OF

02:37:45.355 --> 02:37:46.623
ANALYSIS IS EASILY [inaudible]

02:37:46.690 --> 02:37:48.559
MY MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NONE

02:37:48.625 --> 02:37:49.626
THERE'S A DIFFERENT E. E. O.

02:37:49.693 --> 02:37:51.395
REPORT I WANT TO SAY IT'S LIKE A

02:37:51.461 --> 02:37:54.431
E. O. FOR ITO FIVE THAT

02:37:54.498 --> 02:37:55.399
GOVERNMENT.

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:56.800
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:37:56.867 --> 02:37:58.035
ENTITIES HAVE TO PROVIDE.

02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:00.304
SO IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT BUT THAT

02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:01.705
IS GENERALLY WHY THAT

02:38:01.772 --> 02:38:03.540
INFORMATION IS MORE PUBLICLY

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:05.776
AVAILABLE IT IS REPORTED ON BUT

02:38:05.843 --> 02:38:07.277
IN A DIFFERENT FORM.

02:38:07.344 --> 02:38:10.347
IF YOU CAN GET YOUR FOR ZERO

02:38:10.414 --> 02:38:12.249
FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU.

02:38:12.316 --> 02:38:15.452
ANY OTHER -- BOARD MEMBERS.

02:38:15.519 --> 02:38:16.954
ALL RIGHT -- COUPLE COUPLE

02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:18.956
QUESTION BEFORE WE AND ON VOTE

02:38:19.022 --> 02:38:21.959
ON THE SECTION -- I THINK --

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:23.260
CENTER ON BURKE HAD IT HAS A

02:38:23.327 --> 02:38:25.762
GOOD POINT AND IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:26.997
THAT THERE'S NOT A STATE

02:38:27.064 --> 02:38:28.298
EQUIVALENT TO THIS EVEN THOUGH

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:29.967
APPARENTLY THERE'S ANOTHER FORM

02:38:30.033 --> 02:38:32.035
THAT DOES PROVIDE THE SAME --

02:38:32.102 --> 02:38:34.071
AGGREGATED INFORMATION THAT I

02:38:34.137 --> 02:38:35.239
THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW --

02:38:35.305 --> 02:38:37.374
THE CONFIDENTIALITY I THINK WE

02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:39.476
HEARD FROM ONE OF THE OF FOLKS

02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:40.978
WHO PROVIDED TESTIMONY THAT.

02:38:41.044 --> 02:38:44.047
THERE IS A PENALTY ATTACHED TO

02:38:44.114 --> 02:38:45.048
THE DISCLOSING OF THIS

02:38:45.115 --> 02:38:49.152
INFORMATION -- IN IS IT HAS THAT

02:38:49.219 --> 02:38:52.522
BEEN INCORPORATED -- THE THE

02:38:52.589 --> 02:38:55.626
PENALTY -- ASSUMES THAT THERE'S

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:57.561
OF A PROBLEM WE'VE NEVER HAD A

02:38:57.628 --> 02:38:59.863
PROBLEM I'M NOT INCLINED TO MAKE

02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:01.164
IT A MISDEMEANOR FOR EMPLOYER

02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:03.100
DOESN'T COMPLY WE REALLY DON'T

02:39:03.166 --> 02:39:04.868
HAVE ANY WE ENFORCEMENT

02:39:04.935 --> 02:39:06.703
MECHANISM AT MECHANISM OTHER

02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:08.805
THAN AN INJUNCTION TO GET THEM

02:39:08.872 --> 02:39:10.207
TO APPLY WITH ATTORNEYS FEES.

02:39:10.274 --> 02:39:11.275
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC

02:39:11.341 --> 02:39:13.777
EMPLOYEES SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:17.381
PENALTY -- FOR ED FOR RELEASING

02:39:17.447 --> 02:39:19.650
INFORMATION THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS

02:39:19.716 --> 02:39:21.184
WE WON'T GET THEM TO COMPLY

02:39:21.251 --> 02:39:23.553
BECAUSE WHO WANTS TO BE SUBJECT

02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:25.589
TO CRIMINAL SANCTION -- SO I

02:39:25.656 --> 02:39:26.990
THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVY

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:29.960
HANDED IN EXCESSIVE IF WE DO SEE

02:39:30.027 --> 02:39:31.728
THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE

02:39:31.795 --> 02:39:33.030
RUNNING OUT TO SHARE THAT

02:39:33.096 --> 02:39:34.264
INFORMATION WHICH WE HAVE NEVER

02:39:34.331 --> 02:39:35.499
SEEN IN THE PAST.

02:39:35.565 --> 02:39:37.134
THEN CERTAINLY WE COULD CONSIDER

02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:38.368
SOMETHING BUT MAKING IT A

02:39:38.435 --> 02:39:39.903
MISDEMEANOR I THINK IS IS

02:39:39.970 --> 02:39:41.538
EXCESSIVE AND I THINK IT WILL

02:39:41.605 --> 02:39:46.076
ALSO -- DISCOURAGE EMPLOYEES

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:48.712
FROM DOING THEIR JOB FOR FEAR OF

02:39:48.779 --> 02:39:51.782
BEING SUBJECTED TO THAT.

02:39:51.848 --> 02:39:55.485
SO -- MY LAST COUPLE POINTS ARE.

02:39:55.552 --> 02:39:57.688
MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE

02:39:57.754 --> 02:40:00.190
CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:02.826
LITIGATION OR CLASS ACTION --

02:40:02.893 --> 02:40:04.461
AND I THINK -- IF YOU IF THE

02:40:04.528 --> 02:40:07.431
TRUE INTENT IS AS WE'VE HEARD TO

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:08.365
MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE THE PLOT

02:40:08.432 --> 02:40:10.100
THE LOOK AT THE PLAYING FIELD IS

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.001
LEVELED.

02:40:11.068 --> 02:40:13.036
AND WHETHER IT'S DIRECTLY OR

02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:14.438
OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:17.040
OF THAT WE FIND WAYS.

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:18.375
TO PROTECT THOSE THAT

02:40:18.442 --> 02:40:22.145
PARTICIPATE IN THIS TYPE OF OF

02:40:22.212 --> 02:40:25.248
PROGRAM -- HOW DO YOU THINK THAT

02:40:25.315 --> 02:40:27.818
THERE COULD BE [inaudible]

02:40:27.884 --> 02:40:29.586
CORRECTIVE ACTION.

02:40:29.653 --> 02:40:32.422
MEANING THAT IF THERE IS ANY

02:40:32.489 --> 02:40:34.424
INDUSTRY OR THERE'S A SPECIFIC

02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:35.425
BUSINESS.

02:40:35.492 --> 02:40:37.527
THAT REVEALS THROUGH THERE ARE

02:40:37.594 --> 02:40:39.629
THREE THEIR DATA ARE THE

02:40:39.696 --> 02:40:40.831
ESSENTIALLY.

02:40:40.897 --> 02:40:43.200
IMMUNIZED DURING THIS PERIOD

02:40:43.266 --> 02:40:45.402
WERE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS BEING

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:47.771
PURSUED.

02:40:47.838 --> 02:40:49.072
WILK.

02:40:49.139 --> 02:40:51.208
YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT THIS IS.

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:53.677
DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION AND

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.012
IT'S IT IS NOT.

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:58.015
THE I I THINK.

02:40:58.081 --> 02:41:00.183
YOUR EMPHASIS IS NOT IN A PLACE

02:41:00.250 --> 02:41:02.786
WHERE MY EMPHASISES MY EMPHASIS

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:04.354
IS TO GET COMPLIANCE.

02:41:04.421 --> 02:41:06.089
AND IT IS MY HOPE AND

02:41:06.156 --> 02:41:08.291
EXPECTATION THE COMPANIES WILL

02:41:08.358 --> 02:41:10.460
VOLUNTARILY COMPLY WHEN THEY'RE

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:12.095
TOLD THEY'RE IN FOR THAT THEY

02:41:12.162 --> 02:41:13.864
THAT THEY ARE IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:41:13.930 --> 02:41:15.165
PAY DISPARITY.

02:41:15.232 --> 02:41:16.633
AND WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:18.235
TO CLOSE THAT GAP THAT'S THE

02:41:18.301 --> 02:41:20.237
GOAL THAT'S THE REASON THAT I

02:41:20.303 --> 02:41:21.805
DIDN'T DO A PUBLIC SHAMING.

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:23.373
THERE WAS LEGISLATION LAST YEAR

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:24.641
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL THIS

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:26.576
INFORMATION PUBLIC THAT IS NOT

02:41:26.643 --> 02:41:28.879
MY INTENT MY INTENT IS TO GET

02:41:28.945 --> 02:41:30.847
COMPANIES TO SELF REFLECT.

02:41:30.914 --> 02:41:33.383
AND THEN IF THERE IS A CONTINUES

02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:34.885
TO BE A PROBLEM DEPARTMENT OF

02:41:34.951 --> 02:41:36.653
FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ARE THE

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.257
AGENCY THAT IS CALLED UPON TO DO --

02:41:40.323 --> 02:41:42.392
THE THE FOLLOW UP WORK TO GET

02:41:42.459 --> 02:41:46.263
COMPLIANCE -- WHERE WERE YOU

02:41:46.329 --> 02:41:47.030
WERE CHEST?

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:49.966
TRYING TO FIND THE BEST WAY TO
