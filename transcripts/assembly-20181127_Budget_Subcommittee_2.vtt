college campuses so it's

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.761
important for us to get out of

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.797

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.732

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:18.605

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.540

that it hasn't been easy since

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.483
the Great Recession hit.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.952
High as you know but I we have

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.756
been a bit on the rebound as we

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.191
know in the last few years we

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:38.758
increase funding by about a

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:42.395
billion dollars since.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.029

as well cal grant program.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.305
We're really excited about

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.174
serving more California students

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:55.542
you know when.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.110
When -- I

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.145
know we talk nitty gritty about

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:02.782
things and faculty but when I go

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.350
to my trader Joe's.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.486
Soccer field or when

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:10.623
to talk about their kids their

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.525
neighbors and getting access to

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:13.159
the world class university of

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.396
California system so --

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.030
Certainly with a please that we

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.698
increase enrollment by fifteen

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.533
thousand slots for California

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.335
students.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.437
In the last --

00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:25.071
Five years and I know UC Santa

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:26.839
Barbara has had a piece of that --

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:30.443
Seen the steady growth of an AB

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.447
21% and and and increase estate

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:36.349
planning in the last five years

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:36.649
have seen.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.351
Certainly --

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.018
Help with enrollment growth we

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:40.753
know it's the it's a partnership

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.555
again with the we've had.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.424
To look at the three issues

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.791
state funding.

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:46.826
Money from from non resident

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.563
students throughout California

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.534
has been sure we have this is to

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.603
find the system.

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.605
We also know that higher

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.406
education more and more.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.442
In today's --

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:03.076
You know global economy is the

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.677
neat you know in order to get a

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.746
good paying job.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.581
Today and tomorrow we need more

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:10.383
graduates more people a

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.017
certificate said you see is a

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:14.587
piece of the puzzle and not only --

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.456
Having --

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.090
Increase enrollment but having

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.358
graduate within four years.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.660
And I know that --

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:21.260
You see is is that UC Santa

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:23.129
Barbara I was told earlier it's

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.797
three point nine years the

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:28.401
average time for graduation here.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:28.968
That seems like some type of

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.803
that type of so you want. To get

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.407
to that a bit later but asked by

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.809
that and we need to focus on

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.311
that statewide as well --

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.346
We know there are certainly some

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:40.613
needs --

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.682
Sauce some facilities here the

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.183
old.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.784
Science buildings which is --

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.619
Need a rehab --

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:50.456
You know I think that --

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:50.857
One the side --

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.959
So interpreting America looking

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:54.327
forward.

00:04:54.394 --> 00:04:56.462
To pushing Florida capital --

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.096
Bonds for higher education of

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:58.798
the past few years we've had

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:02.335
that solely on the UC system we

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:02.969
take in order. To to meet --

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.837
And Roman growth and to make

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.472
sure it's a top notch education

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.408
system that they use is that

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.376
system having.

00:05:10.443 --> 00:05:12.412
Facilities bond the ballot makes

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:12.679
sense --

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.647
With that --

00:05:14.714 --> 00:05:15.281
I know what we're going to have

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.582
a great opportunity to get done

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:18.351
the weeds talk about some issues

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.286
and I wanted --

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.221

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.137
I was very excited to and when

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:48.014
our chair decided that he wanted

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:48.648

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:02.361
Can testify how all.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:02.995
It's working at UCSB both with

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:04.363
students but also as a staff

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.731
member here --

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:06.265
And how that really does become

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:06.899
part of that the deliberation

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:07.567
process it becomes part of the

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:08.468
conversations we have --

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:12.371
And I appreciated --

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:14.207
Assembly member --

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:18.344
MCAT McCarty is approach as well

00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:18.845
as assembly member teams

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:19.278
approach [inaudible]

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:22.749
Including in and to continue to

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:26.219
support premier institutions --

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.321
But also to find at a pathway

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.223
for our students I had to be

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.658
part of that premier institution

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:33.226
I think as assembly member

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.527
McCarty has said.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:36.729
At a very common question you

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:40.466
get and not always in the

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.401
hearing raining meeting is.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.069
And and I don't have I mean we

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:43.703
have the director of admissions

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.771
here so I don't need to even

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:46.639
tell her --

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:47.206
How often she must get the

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:50.610
question is will my son or

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:51.244
daughter didn't get and how do

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.179
they get in to you see?

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:55.014
And that reality --

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.784
Doesn't state to add admissions

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.818
office it really becomes a

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.353
reality elected officials as

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:00.553
well.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.889
And we were regularly hearing

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.357
that -- But

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.492
I I remind folks that the the

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.059
reason is because this is a

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:08.194
really great.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.163
Product that we're offering

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:10.830
right it's a really great deal

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:12.698
it's a really great experience

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.767
it's a really great education.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:18.638
And if it wasn't the case then

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.273
we wouldn't have people in the

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.441
public regularly asking us about

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:24.844
a pathway to get to the UC and

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:26.712
to earn a degree from the UC.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.714
And that's what it comes down to

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.117
that we are offering --

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:34.453
Something in California --

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.556
That -- All

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:37.223
around the world want to be part

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.058
of at so it's exciting at to be

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.127
here to hear to get an update --

00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:44.430
About where you see SB that and

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:45.131
not just in terms of numbers but

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.732
in terms of also directives on

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.367
where.

00:07:48.434 --> 00:07:49.035
You see SB sees itself going --

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.469
I think it's an important

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:52.572
conversation I know at having

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.740
worked for the UC sometimes a

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.210
certain UC's get --

00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:00.379
A lot more of our law of the

00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:03.316
kind of the talk and then other

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:04.250
you season so I remind folks

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.419
that -- Our

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.254
system is a system and certainly

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.656
the needs for one you see may

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:12.525
not be replicated at other UC's

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.560
and the situation is different --

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:16.963
I've seen how hard you see SB

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:18.531
has tried --

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:20.600
Really been active in not just

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.568
retirement but in the enrollment

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.337
looking like California --

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.572
I I can't even speak enough to

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.541
the support services that we

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.175
provide for students on campus

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.476
and so that is all --

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:32.612
Very important part of the

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.580
larger equation --

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.349
For us in the state legislature

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.618

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:40.392
economic engine of the state and

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:44.496
providing the best education. To

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:46.565
the citizens of the state of

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.400
California --

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:52.437
Assist.

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.573
On the financial health of all

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:58.243
campus and the challenges we

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.910
cover in the face including the

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:00.645
issues of deferred maintenance.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:02.948
Again we want to welcome you to

00:23:03.014 --> 00:23:04.583
all campus and look forward to

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.518
the opportunity to to share the

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:08.820
stories of UC Santa Barbara bush

00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:10.589
many accomplishments into some

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:14.392
awful challenges.

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:16.361
Thank you thank you.

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:18.597
Okay thank you for that starting

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:35.147
soft.

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:35.547
Can you hear me.

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:35.914
My god great --

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:40.252
Classes.

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:40.852
I thank you to chairman of the

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:42.387
sec.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:44.422
Bowman and Jackson.

00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.391
My name is James and I and it's

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.260
in recent.

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.362
Who services the executive

00:23:50.428 --> 00:23:52.631
director of budget and planning?

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:53.231
Of the division of finance and

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:53.865
resource management encompasses

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:54.699
the budget office business and

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:55.167
financial services.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:56.501
I didn't advisory services

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:57.035
procurement institutional

00:23:57.102 --> 00:23:58.570
research real estate faculty and

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.572
staff housing and capital and

00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.607
environmental planning.

00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:03.308
Your packet you have received --

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:04.509
Provides an overview of are

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:05.177
campus budget as well as recent

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:05.744
history of our revenue and

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:06.411
expense trends.

00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:07.012
As noted our budget is been

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.580
relatively stable over the last

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:08.880
five years.

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.649
We are reliant on student

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:11.216
tuition and fees and state

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:13.385
appropriations for the majority

00:24:13.451 --> 00:24:14.286
of our revenues.

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:16.421
With student tuition and fees

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:20.292
comprising thirty per se.

00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.594
Appropriations at nineteen other

00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:24.396
fun sources that make up our

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:24.930
annual budget are largely

00:24:24.996 --> 00:24:26.598
restricted or designated find

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:28.466
categories.

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:29.034
Such as gifts contracts and

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.569
grants and exhilarating

00:24:30.635 --> 00:24:32.304
enterprises.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:32.871
The vast majority of our

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:47.385
operating expenses nearly 66%

00:24:47.452 --> 00:24:50.388
are for employees salaries and

00:24:50.455 --> 00:24:54.259
wages and employee benefits.

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:56.494
He's with --

00:24:56.561 --> 00:24:58.363
Gentleman Jim benefit impacts

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.897
recruitment and retention

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:00.932
efforts Martin and I work with

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:02.434
chancer Yang to stretch our

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.269
resources to make ends meet.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:04.769
We utilize an array of

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:05.403
strategies to match appropriate

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.571
resources with campus priorities.

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:07.105
In the fulfillment of our

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:08.506
mission.

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:09.074
Is our offices role to work

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.708
closely with our chance wearing

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:10.475
collaborate with campus

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:10.976
constituents on resource

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.377
planning. To further enhance the

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:12.944
success of our students and

00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:14.346
faculty.

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:14.846
Any new initiatives --

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.615
Establishes pilot projects

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.416
through the use of one time

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:20.151
funds others are established

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:20.752
over a period of two or three

00:25:20.819 --> 00:25:22.754
years whereby we increase the

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:24.489
permanent funds incrementally

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.358
resources become available.

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:28.460
And allow the program to just

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:30.462
date with initial one time

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:30.829
seeing funding.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.530
Later this afternoon you will

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.266
hear from our colleagues on a

00:25:34.332 --> 00:25:36.534
few of these newer initiatives.

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:37.135
We've also utilize revenues

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:38.403
generated from are non resident

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.705
tuition to address funding gaps

00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:42.474
to somewhat restore programs.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.074
That will reduce during the

00:25:43.141 --> 00:25:46.645
budget reductions experienced

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:47.112
earlier this decade.

00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:59.691
The challenge of pushing limited

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:02.327
resources for further Google

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:06.264
lean.

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:08.366
Tampa's with since.

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:08.600
These.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.568
Are high rate of student Plamen

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:11.102
allows us to address the

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.604
challenging local labor market.

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.305
And provides an important source

00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:13.872
of income and professional

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:14.572
development for our students.

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:16.508
While we have been a resourceful

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:17.075
and innovative campus many

00:26:17.142 --> 00:26:18.576
initiatives in early phase

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:20.378
opportunities are not pursued

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:20.979
due to physical constraints.

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.614
The best funding scenario for

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:23.114
our campus is one with

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.883
predictable consistent revenue

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.384
growth over a period of time.

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:26.818
Your your financial

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.753
uncertainties push our campus

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.622
into a strategy where and we

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:32.290
protect resources.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:32.824
Committed to the essential

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.626
basics and perhaps miss the

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:38.396
opportunity to make additional

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:39.064
headway in pursuit of excellence.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.398
We are accustomed to addressing

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:42.434
budget budgetary challenges we

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.101
are always appreciative of our

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.602
partnership with the state of

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.371
California.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.440
In securing long term financial

00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:50.608
viability we can both say the

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.344
funds invested at UC Santa

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:52.944
Barbara bring about positive

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.579
impact in the lives of our

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:56.247
students faculty and staff and

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:56.915
for the benefit of our state and

00:26:56.982 --> 00:27:00.385
nation.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:01.019
Perhaps even more importantly

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.487
than the annual operating budget

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.589
challenges we face our campus is

00:27:04.656 --> 00:27:06.491
feeling significant and growing

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.460
pressure from limited capital

00:27:08.526 --> 00:27:08.860
budget resources.

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:10.662
We do not benefit from the very

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:12.697
financial resources available to

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.366
campuses with medical centers.

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:16.601
And have a much greater reliance

00:27:16.668 --> 00:27:18.570
on traditional core funds such

00:27:18.636 --> 00:27:20.205
as state appropriations and

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:20.805
student fees for our annual

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.340
operations.

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.409
This means our campus has fewer

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:26.478
resources to draw upon when

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:28.613
seeking funds to construct new

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.180
instructional and research

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:30.582
buildings or to address the ever

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.584
growing need for deferred

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.386
maintenance investment.

00:27:34.452 --> 00:27:34.986
Over the past two decades we

00:27:35.053 --> 00:27:36.621
have utilized the Garamendi

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:48.033
mechanism. To fund capital

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:48.333
expansion.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.702
As you may know this was a state

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:51.336
program that allowed the campus

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:52.370
to read [inaudible]

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.606
In increments the balance

00:27:54.672 --> 00:27:56.775
between additional in direct

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:58.743
cost recovery funds and capital

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.578
needs.

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:01.246
While we were able to construct

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.714
much needed space this further

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:04.816
reduce the amount of flexible

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.751
funding needed operate our

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:06.985
campus.

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:10.488
We believe we have leverage this

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:12.524
funding source as far as we can.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.091
Stem pride program such as

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:14.626
physics and engineering are

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.428
amongst the more desired

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:17.028
programs for two days you see

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:18.530
applicants.

00:28:18.596 --> 00:28:20.398
Our ability to accommodate these

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:22.200
hopeful undergraduates is

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:24.369
impacted by shortage of space.

00:28:24.436 --> 00:28:26.504
Are physics program is rated by

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:27.105
the national Research Council

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:28.706
amongst the top five programs in

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:30.508
the nation.

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:31.109
Since two thousand six we've

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:34.579
experienced a 3100% increase in

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:35.246
our undergraduate physics majors

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:36.481
enrollment and this friends not

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:38.249
slowing down.

00:28:38.316 --> 00:28:40.385
However we've not seen an

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.420
increase in permanent physics

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:42.754
space since.

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.355
Nineteen ninety four our campus

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.591
undertaken a planning exercise

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.593
to program and budget a new

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.528
building to address the needs

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.129
for additional physics space.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.530
We anticipate the need for a

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.732
hundred and twenty five thousand

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:55.200
square foot building.

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:56.935
With the construction costs of

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.570
roughly a hundred and sixty

00:28:58.636 --> 00:28:59.204
million to address that current

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:00.438
need.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:02.373
Our campus simply doesn't have

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.175
the fiscal resources necessary

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:04.776
to address a facility of that

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:06.311
magnitude.

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:08.646
Our campus also anticipate to

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:09.247
facility of similar size and

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:10.648
construction costs for

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.383
engineering program.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.385
A highly ranked engineering

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:16.754
program is also in the in great

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:17.288
demand from undergraduate

00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:18.690
applicants and experiences a

00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:20.458
similar need for instruction and

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:20.825
respect space.

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:22.560
The likelihood of constructing

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.395
new physics engine engineering

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:28.533
space is entirely reliant on

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.335
capital funding from the state.

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:30.935
In addition to our focus on

00:29:31.002 --> 00:29:32.637
laboratory buildings all over

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.506
campus disappointing shooting

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:35.140
including humanities and fine

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:36.708
arts and social sciences.

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.510
Are impacted by a shortage of

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:40.345
classroom space.

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.547
As our campus a Roman grows our

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:44.282
daily classroom facilities are

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.317
challenged to keep up with

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.253
today's instructional needs.

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:48.853
The last classroom building on

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.588
our that our campus constructed

00:29:50.655 --> 00:29:52.290
was completed in.

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.559
Nineteen sixty seven we have --

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.160
Recently received preliminary

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:56.661
project approval from the UC

00:29:56.728 --> 00:29:58.630
regents for new classroom

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:00.265
building to be constructed

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:02.767
utilizing AB ninety four funding.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:03.368
As combined with campus funds

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:06.471
derived earnings.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:08.273
This building will provide more

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:10.275
than twenty three hundred new

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:12.243
classroom seats in support of

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.312
undergraduate education.

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.181
In addition to the pressing need

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.283
for major capital investment

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:18.816
we're in the process of

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.451
inspecting our facilities and

00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:20.952
cataloging or deferred

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:22.620
maintenance backlog as part of

00:30:22.687 --> 00:30:24.422
the UC wide initiative.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.524
I present our best estimate of

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.426
deferred maintenance for our

00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:29.060
state supported facilities is

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:30.628
nearly six hundred million

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.230
dollars.

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.532
Most of our buildings range up

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.001
our range in age from forty

00:30:37.068 --> 00:30:38.703
building systems are at the end

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.438
of their useful life.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.540
In the past couple of years

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:43.174
we've utilized one time state

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.642
funds to address our greatest

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.544
points of failure but the

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.680
backlog is significant and

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:49.047
growing larger.

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.748
Deferred maintenance has also

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.517
presented challenges for many of

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.252
our lab renovations as we

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:54.719
recruit new faculty.

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:56.888
Many of our newly recruited

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.256
faculty need specialized

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.391
laboratory instruction spaces

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.460
and these sorts of reap

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.127
renovations can trigger building

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.429
like system replacement.

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:06.598
And associated CO complaints

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:08.333
upgrades.

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.000
Issue said to be such as he is

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:12.170
make the process of factly

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:14.472
recruitment even more difficult.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.139
In summary we wish to thank you

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:16.274
for the opportunity to highlight

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:16.908
some of the challenges we face

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:18.476
here at UCSB --

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.411
We hope this free presentations

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:22.447
been informative.

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:23.081
And Martin and I are happy to

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:26.918
answer any questions you may

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:32.457
have for us.

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:36.461
But that hasn't for to have one

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:40.465
okay gotcha I do have been times

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:42.467
interview questions sure --

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:46.471
As I as I noted earlier Ripper

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.506
very aware of the capital

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.575
conversations and because I told

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.410
them earlier.

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:54.479
Whenever we go on a tour of a

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.481
college campus we always go and

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.416
see the crime the science lab.

00:31:58.483 --> 00:32:00.551
Whether it's a community college

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:02.687
who UC or CSU so we know that to

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.422
AB we invested.

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:08.559
In the we used to have in the

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.728
nineties and two thousands and

00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:12.196
injects remembered.

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:14.265
Now that the bonds on the ballot

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:16.501
had been they they K.. Fourteen

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:17.135
months and I think we should go

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.503
back through the cake threes

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:20.505
three sixteen bonds to focus

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:24.342
that for UC and CSU.

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.444
So that being said --

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:28.613
How much is currently being

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.548
diverted from your friend for

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:36.187
example UC Santa Barbara lot me?

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:36.821
To to capital of this all these

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:40.425
which otherwise could go --

00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:40.825
To campus needs.

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:44.295
Student services expanding

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:46.597
enrollment you know maybe

00:32:46.664 --> 00:32:50.268
painting as a picture.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:52.503
Okay -- If

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.171
if even a back of the envelope

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:54.806
if yeah that that's probably the

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:56.708
best I'm going to be able to do

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:57.008
for you --

00:32:57.075 --> 00:33:00.378
So are --

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:02.313
Our overall expenditure on

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:02.947
deferred maintenance on a year

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:04.349
to year basis is about four

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:04.982
point five million dollars if

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.818
you set aside on in permanent

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:08.353
funding.

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:08.953
And in addition to that if we

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.488
have one time funding we

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.122
increase that those are dollars

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.357
that we have at the state park

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:12.990
sorry at the university that we

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:13.324
would have.

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:14.692
Directed elsewhere on the campus

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:16.561
if we weren't committing those

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:18.363
to deferred maintenance programs.

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:20.665
I think the the other thing.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.467
And and I've just got to give

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:23.167
you kind of back of the envelope

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:24.769
estimates on that there's you

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.337
know it at least.

00:33:26.404 --> 00:33:30.408
Somewhere in the nay lab

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.276
renovations and facility

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.178
renovations were utilizing

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:34.779
indirect cost recovery from

00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.581
federal grants and we're taking

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:48.326
those dollars.

00:33:48.393 --> 00:33:48.960
In turning around and investing

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:50.228
them in renovation lab

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:52.497
renovation programs that we work

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:54.766
spent money on those laps we

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:58.269
probably with.

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:58.770
Using for more last --

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.405
Off the top.

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:02.407
Would be the data associated

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:02.940
with Garamendi mechanism.

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.575
And so that that was a choice

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.277
the campus made where.

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:06.911
We were able to take money that

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:07.545
would have otherwise been used

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:08.579
for instructional purposes and

00:34:08.646 --> 00:34:10.448
committed to pay down --

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.550
And we have five buildings I

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:13.184
think that our Garamendi funded

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.585
that and the largest one of

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.220
which is --

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:16.888
Bioengineering building and they

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:18.523
believe the Garamendi component

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:19.157
of that was about a forty five

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:20.525
million dollar.

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:22.527
Obligation so the annual --

00:34:22.593 --> 00:34:24.262
Interest on all of those

00:34:24.328 --> 00:34:24.929
buildings combines probably in

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:28.499
the neighborhood of seven to

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:34.272
eight million would be my guess

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:34.572
[inaudible]

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.374
Longer face [inaudible]

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:40.311
The without.

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:42.580
A I TP physics yet longer but

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.282
that will that --

00:34:44.348 --> 00:34:46.384
Entropy yeah we did receive

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:46.951
philanthropy yeah that's a

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:48.619
should know that of course --

00:34:48.686 --> 00:34:50.254
We had a donor who provided --

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:52.523
The donor developed project to

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.358
provide the residents for

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:54.859
visitors of our Cavalli

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.694
institute of theoretical physics

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:58.496
up Charlie Munger.

00:34:58.563 --> 00:34:59.096
Provided that and that was a

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.364
sixty five million dollar

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.500
building that he bill for us we

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.635
didn't have to take something

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:05.002
like that on so.

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:10.341
If they basically tell you what

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.008
you're going to bill yeah yeah I

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:12.610
mean it's I don't say no but I

00:35:12.677 --> 00:35:14.579
mean it's that there's not a

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:18.249
whole lot of you know given take

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:18.749
their yeah certainly --

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:22.420
Donor interest in a project can

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:23.054
have varying levels of control

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.589
but it one one which their

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:26.390
funding the entire thing if it

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.459
is a more at the toners.

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:28.960
Discretion certainly in

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.528
consultation with the campus but

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.463
yeah.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.565
Noticed my brother relationship

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:38.336
with Santa Barbara.

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:42.340
But he does his aye grandson was

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:44.542
a student there you go yeah good

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:46.277
kid thing to have enough said

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:50.481
he's been actively engage with

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:52.350
our campus yeah --

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:56.420
And those kinds of gifts come

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.356
kind of once in a lifetime yes

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:58.523
so.

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:00.458
Yeah they are they are very

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:01.092
unique we don't see Gipson of

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.493
that magnitude very frequently

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.662
he if I may you you didn't

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:06.464
mention the housing problem --

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:08.332
Which is a significant problem

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:08.933
this was the last university

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.203
built within the coastal zone --

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.338
And as a result building within

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:18.242
it is has been.

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.478
I'd a challenge and and frankly

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.012
if I'm not mistaken quite

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:24.248
expensive yeah --

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:24.882
With it I don't I hope I'm not

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:26.717
jumping ahead but it seemed like

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:27.251
a logical question ask.

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:28.619
Given the fact that you saw a

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:29.287
room with three in a room that

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:31.022
probably should have been for

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:34.725
one and a half dissipating.

00:36:34.792 --> 00:36:36.294
Resolving that housing problem

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.429
going forward --

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:38.996
There was a mention by the

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:42.567
chancellor which I thought.

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:42.900
I did want.

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.268
To get a little more information

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.270
about this workforce housing on

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:48.339
campus with a third party vendor.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:50.608
Could you perhaps sure I'd be

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:51.275
happy to share a little bit and

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.643
then also the whole housing

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.612
issue we don't have enough

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:54.979
housing here.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:58.416
And UCSB housing and I love this

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:02.420
state is legendary.

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:03.054
I won't say overall helpful but

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.622
legendary over the course years

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.457
were you'll have eight or nine

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:10.328
students in a house on what is

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:12.697
the the the you know.

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:14.432
I forget the street at the

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.200
moment I don't know what I am

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.569
thinking del playa fits a two or

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:19.203
three bedroom so they create

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.172
bunk housing in the living room

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.607
and god only knows what else

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:24.442
they're very resourceful.

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:26.744
But there just isn't enough

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:30.581
housing yes that and then this

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:32.450
third party short.

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:33.084
Of when you start with a third

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.418
party project --

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:36.420
Because that's one we're working

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.689
on right now I think I can work

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:40.458
with just one Mike here.

00:37:40.524 --> 00:37:42.326
Like the stereo effect up --

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.829
So Ocean road is a project our

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.263
campus --

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:46.831
Started working on in two

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.532
thousand six in the intent there

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:50.468
is for us to build --

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.503
A major housing development that

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.104
would be mixed use housing so

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.839
some retail or campus serving

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:56.774
space on the first floor and

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.442
residential above --

00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:00.444
Intended to be entirely for

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.480
faculty and staff.

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:05.049
At UCSB opponent would be a for

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.018
sale and a component would be

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.419
rental housing.

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.521
And this was really our campuses

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:12.556
attempt to address workforce

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:12.823
housing.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.525
On our campus and so what's

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:15.092
envisioned is over a project

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.494
that would --

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.028
Delivers somewhere in the

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:18.195
neighborhood of five hundred and

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:20.398
forty residential units and that

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:22.433
would be combinations of one two

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.203
three and four bedroom units --

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:33.711
Associated parking it's which is

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:34.378
currently the border of on the

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.714
campus with file best I think

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.549
when you walk to ID last night

00:38:38.616 --> 00:38:38.816
process.

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.851
It's a it's a wide road we're

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:41.452
going to narrow the road and

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:42.586
there is a significant amount of

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:44.388
campus land running.

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.524
Along the north south fine --

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.659
Of the border of Isla Vista and

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.429
that would all be developed to

00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:52.029
be faculty and staff housing.

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.230
We're looking to do that what

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:54.565
the third party developer.

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.734
And so the dentist to find --

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.436
Development --

00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.036
Agency that would come in.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.805
And would enter into a long term

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.840
ground lease with the university

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.608
develop that housing manage the

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:08.379
rental component and sell the

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:08.913
for sale component of the

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:09.180
housing.

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:10.381
The faculty and staff.

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:12.450
We think --

00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.084
You know some of the the major

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.985
benefits of that are obviously

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:16.387
bringing.

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.322
Up our campus population closer

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.725
to the campus so folks who were

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:21.358
commuting hours would have the

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:26.897
opportunity to walk to work --

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:32.236
It we also think that.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:32.837
I love this the which is you

00:39:32.903 --> 00:39:34.538
know currently X. during the

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.841
summer and during the holiday

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:38.409
season --

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:40.377
And then bringing in a different

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:40.945
age population that would

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.780
probably spur different sorts of

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:45.182
businesses and really help make

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:46.484
sure.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.352
That I love this the business

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:48.986
district and I think that that's

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:52.389
it's an excellent opportunity.

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.023
For I love this set and for the

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.592
university of to get a great

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:58.295
example of a convergence.

00:39:58.362 --> 00:40:02.266
I think --

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.568
That process we are starting the

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:05.236
early planning phase of that and

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.504
we would intend to use a request

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.672
for proposal process public

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.206
process. To identify the

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.975
developers and we think that'll

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:11.609
happen at the beginning of this

00:40:11.675 --> 00:40:12.510
coming year.

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.512
And so sometime in twenty

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:15.079
nineteen will be out on the

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.580
streets looking for the

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:18.682
development partner.

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:19.316
And hopefully make that move

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:20.618
board it was included in our

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:20.918
party P..

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.753
So it has its preliminary

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.822
approval from the coast mission

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:26.590
although it will need of project

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:28.526
specific approval --

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:32.496
As the student housing we have --

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.063
An agreement with the local

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.598
community.

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:35.232
With our long range development

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:36.700
plan that we would build five

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.969
thousand beds to address our

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:39.570
increasing enrollment through

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:42.406
the year twenty twenty five we

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:44.809
built about fifteen minutes not

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:45.009
read.

00:40:45.075 --> 00:40:47.144
New bands that do that yes

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.879
correct net new beds is the term

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:52.283
I think we use and yeah.

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.451
That is --

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:56.487
Intended --

00:40:56.554 --> 00:40:57.021
To to address all of our

00:40:57.087 --> 00:41:00.457
enrollment agreement during that

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:00.758
time and so.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:06.297
We've.

00:41:06.363 --> 00:41:08.365
As we opened a San Joaquin which

00:41:08.432 --> 00:41:08.999
was a thousand new balance in

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:12.336
apartments around ascetic

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:14.271
Catalina the tower resonances

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:14.538
malls --

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:15.206
We're currently in the planning

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:16.607
phase for the next phases of

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:18.275
student housing --

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.477
And we're considering at like a

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:22.479
variety of options of what the

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:24.415
the best way to go --

00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:26.283
Part LRT Pete envisioned

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:26.884
redeveloping existing housing

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.319
sites.

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.321
And so going into what is

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:34.391
currently stork apartments --

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.393
Senate as apartments in our west

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.395
apartment as well as some of the

00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:39.029
Channel Islands residents also

00:41:39.096 --> 00:41:40.831
we toured today. To redevelop

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:42.700
those areas and increase the

00:41:42.766 --> 00:41:56.747
density and build additional.

00:41:56.814 --> 00:42:00.584
Housing [inaudible]

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:06.390
The number [inaudible] Two I

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.459
think a difficult environment

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:08.893
for young people.

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.661
Living three people to a room --

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:12.229
That's really not intended for

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:12.563
more than --

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.632
Two and other things of that

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:14.832
sort.

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:15.466
The fact that you're going to

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:16.567
increase the density concerns me

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.302
a little bit --

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.371
I'm told some of this can create.

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:22.439
Health issues.

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:22.940
Mental health issues.

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.575
I mean I I'm too old to envision

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.744
being back in college and having

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.180
to share a room with anybody --

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:32.349
Hard enough sharing a house with

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:36.553
but I think this is.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.756
This is a concern I I can I

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:42.159
don't know if it's within the

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.228
scope of the state's national.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.664
City I thought you meant multi

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.532
story or you're not talking

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.301
about within all all the people

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.336
in it in an individualized could

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:52.903
not not more people sharing

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.772
bedrooms ideally.

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.573
We would be de chanting those

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.242
students that are in the in

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:00.444
three person rooms.

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.346
Into two rooms yeah that would

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:02.947
that would ultimately be the

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:04.848
call but that being said putting

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.517
is the to rather than three are

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:07.051
you actually increasing

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.919
availability of housing or just

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.354
making it more livable --

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:10.888
We would be increasing the

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.258
availability okay yeah that is

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:14.558
the intent.

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:15.192
Well I'm glad to hear that that

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:20.497
that I was misunderstanding I

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.399
just think.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:23.033
We've got to take into account

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.435
human behavior and trying to

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:26.437
crunch a whole bunch of people

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:26.837
into a room is.

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:31.175
Is not good. For for one so I

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:32.343
think mental and physical health.

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:34.979
Care thank you you know what I

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.246
had some budget questions but

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.682
let's take that stick on housing

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:39.316
from it because because frankly

00:43:39.383 --> 00:43:40.384
this is an issue.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:44.288
Not Santa Barbara you see why

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:44.788
see is you wide it.

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:46.256
There are no easy --

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:48.759
Solutions to it and so we're

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:50.394
trying to to think out outside

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:52.196
the box --

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:52.896
You know one thing that I I I've

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:54.832
been seeing across California

00:43:54.898 --> 00:44:00.371
and even right in my district.

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:02.272
By.

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.408
They get landers under utilized

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.075
strip mall across the street or

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.510
few.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:08.479
More than a mile away.

00:44:08.545 --> 00:44:10.848
And you know tearing it down and

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:12.716
build a multi family housing

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:14.551
there because universities you

00:44:14.618 --> 00:44:14.752
know.

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.520
We hear a lot about housing

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.422
plans to meet with you know

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.056
present the poll thành I'll

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:19.356
talk about.

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.791
But that's not your bread and

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.793
butter and you know that you

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.293
bred better is educating

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.263
students and two buildings in

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:26.897
hand facilities and that's hard

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:28.565
not in and of itself.

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:39.476
Yep but you know doing massive

00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:42.379
housing development just it's

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:48.352
it's it's it's it's not.

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:52.222
On my* so.

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:54.425
No here you have third straight --

00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:58.495
You know.

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:00.230
Did you in simplicity.

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:02.366
My understanding is.

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:08.605
Here's all the title more land

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:12.409
outside of the university so

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.344
that's Mike my first things kind

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:14.878
of what's happening on the

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.280
outside you know.

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:16.947
If you start with that sure well

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:18.682
it you know it's an interesting

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:20.818
environment for us here so when

00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:21.452
we went forward with our long

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:24.321
range development plan in --

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:24.955
Two thousand ten the chancellor

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.590
encouraged us to get out and

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.592
meet with the representatives of

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:30.761
the county of Santa Barbara

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:32.563
Santa Barbara and city a leader.

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.431
And actually negotiate the terms

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.300
for whatever development would

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:36.867
look like and what were the

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.202
conditions that.

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:40.270
That they would find acceptable

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:40.904
as we move forward so weak we

00:45:40.971 --> 00:45:44.274
engaged in a multi month process --

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.343
With those folks and one of the

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:46.877
conditions they felt very

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:48.745
strongly was that we had to

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:52.182
absorb a 100% of our enrollment

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.418
growth on existing campus land.

00:45:54.485 --> 00:45:58.222
And they did not want us to buy.

00:45:58.288 --> 00:46:02.192
Any land from either Kalita or

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.661
the I love this to and develop

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.430
not because it was a concern

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.064
about coming off the tax rolls.

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.765
And so there was a real emphasis

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.734
for us to build and develop on

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.636
our existing land and that terms

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.538
we agreed.

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:24.448
To wear that any housing bills --

00:46:24.515 --> 00:46:25.115
I think there's some things we

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:26.450
probably didn't understand at

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.252
that time week we didn't quite

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:28.919
understand what the make up of I

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.320
love this to was --

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.389
We thought it was just UCSB

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.525
students and community and I

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.560
think there's a much larger

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.795
population in Isla Vista and as

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.430
we build housing.

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.933
I live as the cap back feeling

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.401
very quickly --

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:48.272
The city of galena has has --

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:50.274
Approved and constructed a

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:50.741
significant amount of

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:52.409
residential space.

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.411
Both for sale and rental space

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:55.078
and their intent and desire is

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:58.415
they would rather that be. For

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.651
nine students and so what they

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:02.352
they've kind of looked at is is

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:04.188
this is for good leaders growth

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:04.788
and they don't want to see you

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:06.523
see espys growth.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.458
Consuming that housing and so

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:10.694
there hasn't been a mindset of

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.229
saying cam the community.

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:12.729
Bill the housing for the

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:16.533
university and and we stick to

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.167
just doing university there was

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:18.335
really a push for us.

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:18.969
To be self sufficient in that

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:20.337
regard.

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:21.004
I think as we looking go forward

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.372
we have to consider options --

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:22.940
When we did the long range

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.408
development plan there was not a

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:25.042
lot of third party development

00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:26.443
in the UC system?

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:32.849
And now it's you know it's it's

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.718
rampant it's change that we

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:36.353
probably need to go back to the

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.290
city and county and talk through.

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:42.159
You have something that

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:42.459
[inaudible]

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.528
About your that's okay

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.563
chancellor but when they had

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.665
something but back to the the

00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:52.169
overall housing crunch --

00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.438
It's it's it's really to Paul

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.306
that the impacts it's one is

00:47:56.373 --> 00:47:58.542
that just the debt load if you

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.176
have could that debt load for

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:00.744
the average you see your seats

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.212
you graduate.

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.448
Between twenty and thirty

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:06.516
granted it's not tuition you

00:48:06.583 --> 00:48:06.717
know.

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:10.454
Because two thirds of your

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.222
students here other kids.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:16.260
Cal grant held or enter the you

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.562
know the UC coal or middle class

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:20.097
scholarship to the paying

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:22.733
minimal tuition and housing.

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.434
And then of course --

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.436
You know to look at but access

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.505
if we had more housing that you

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.307
would be less pressure the long

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:30.874
redevelopment plan you can

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.411
stretch out of certain more.

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:34.978
Californians and more than

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.446
people that are hit me up at

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.382
trader Joe's about how.

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:42.319
Their kids want to be a Galgiani

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:44.254
even from Santa Barbara

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:44.554
[inaudible]

00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:46.256
So -- What

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:48.558
could this what could we're

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:49.226
talking all about problems here

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:50.727
double I I know we talked about

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:58.302
this? One for college students.

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.337
I have to admit I haven't

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:00.704
thought about.

00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:02.606
It you know forever housing is

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:04.608
being considered something that

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.243
was a self supporting --

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.612
Enterprise in so it was never

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.447
eligible for state support.

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.349
And so --

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:12.983
You know probably it would be

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.384
and the incentives for

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.386
developers and and spring the

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.221
development community.

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.490
I think would be an area where

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:22.192
the state could play a and is

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:22.826
there anything I entitled issues

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:24.227
because certainly.

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:28.398
If you went bottom vacant lot.

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.400
You know.

00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:34.271
Austrian Isla this that now for

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:34.871
example you have to go through

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:35.072
that.

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.606
Santa Barbara county planning

00:49:36.673 --> 00:49:38.408
department all that but if you

00:49:38.475 --> 00:49:39.042
have it on you see land you go

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.310
through your own.

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:42.279
Houses is rare been thoughts as

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:42.813
far as if it's university

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.748
project within a certain area

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:50.487
and any ideas about entitlement.

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:52.622
And development.

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:53.290
Well that's that's probably one

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:54.458
of the great advantages

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:55.058
university house is being its

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:58.295
own.

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:58.862
You know that certainly is

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:00.697
something that helps.

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.466
But again we are in a situation

00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:04.568
where our local community didn't

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:06.770
want us to expand our physical

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.839
footprint and to the neighboring

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.307
communities and so.

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:12.342
You know it's it's it probably

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:12.609
is -- The

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.611
better poll of us buying

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:16.380
property elsewhere is the impact

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.548
on property tax.

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:19.182
I think that that's the thing

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.283
that's about that would be

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:20.951
difficult for the county if we

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.986
come in and we buy something and

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.521
take it off the tax rolls --

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.623
If we're keeping on the tax

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.290
rolls that puts a challenge on

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:30.193
the affordability and so there's

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.362
a little bit of a vicious circle --

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:34.531
And in that regard.

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.299
So if you if Santa Barbara

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:40.270
bought land just across the

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:40.837
street Derek and I love this

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.539
stuff.

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:44.841
Would you take can you entitle

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:48.578
it through the UC process yes

00:50:48.645 --> 00:50:48.779
yeah.

00:50:48.845 --> 00:50:50.414
Okay yeah.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.047
Yeah so when we buy it if it

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.616
comes region's land we entitled

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:54.451
it through the UC process.

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.720
Now we're still in the coastal

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:56.920
zone.

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.388
So we still have to go through

00:50:58.455 --> 00:50:58.755
the coastal --

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.524
Commission for any sort of

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.428
approval of the developing an

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:05.128
outside of the coastal zone then

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:16.540
it would solely be at the

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.308
region's for entitlement.

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:20.277
It is sort of the dilemma

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:20.577
[inaudible]

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:22.212
It's not.

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:24.214
You can do.

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:24.781
We are clear and I think get

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:26.616
UCLA instead of are we don't

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:27.217
have adequate housing for our

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:28.385
students.

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:28.952
So it took a chicken and egg

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.220
problem.

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:30.821
And I would suspect that not

00:51:30.887 --> 00:51:32.589
only are there some fiscal

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:33.223
issues but I think in terms of

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.558
land use and so forth.

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:36.193
I'm not sure go leaders excited

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:38.361
about having more students and

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:40.197
have this design incorporated

00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:42.432
night there are those issues and

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:43.133
you know it really is a bit of a

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.734
dilemma but it does add to the

00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:46.570
cost of students coming to

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.371
school when they have got --

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.440
To pay exorbitant amounts of

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.476
money for very little in the way

00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.478
of a place to live and I I don't

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.379
know if you see SB has a problem

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:56.913
but I keep hearing about

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.648
different schools where some of

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.617
our students are living in their

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:02.652
cars and and couch surfing and

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.187
that's just.

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:10.327
No way to you can't study you

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:10.760
know center Jackson.

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.395
You.

00:52:12.462 --> 00:52:14.297
Yeah yeah yeah.

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:16.466
Accommodating the student for

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.401
the housing is is only one of

00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:18.969
the most important thing --

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.337
Actually --

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.339
Because of the increasing and in

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:24.608
state students we want

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:26.576
accommodate more California

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:26.843
students.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.480
So we we need more.

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.482
Most pressing needs other more

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:34.217
classrooms teaching.

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.353
Learning facilities and also

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:38.722
increased the number of staff to

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.524
take care of them --

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:42.292
The increasing number Offa

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.694
faculty members to give them

00:52:44.761 --> 00:52:46.429
better teaching an accommodation

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.365
and then the building the

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.700
facilities for a comedy they

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.402
living --

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.604
Environment it is one of the

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.473
very important thing if the

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.241
state can help us in the other

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.544
areas like teaching faculty and

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.546
all that I think university when

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.781
we do well we can also seek from

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:06.483
anthropic support to help us.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.552
With -- With

00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:12.556
with the dormitories we're still

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.491
working on that so their own

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.459
these old rule problems.

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.127
And if we campaña accommodating

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:20.263
more students I think we can

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.265
ease that the niece and I have a

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.501
stock which is one of five all

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.503
current effort as well.

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.705
Because I'm gonna go back to the

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:28.972
budget --

00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.407
And I appreciate the

00:53:30.473 --> 00:53:30.974
conversation about housing I

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.876
think it historically number

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.711
sessions about housing in Santa

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:35.145
Barbara county --

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:36.580
Have been difficult.

00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:38.748
Whether we look at that lends

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.283
from -- From

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:40.951
the student perspective or just

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:42.452
from residents perspective --

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:44.588
And I think that that will

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:46.489
continue --

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.358
Related to the budget it was

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.360
great to hear and to at you know

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:50.927
things are going well now.

00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:52.796
And in the state legislature

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.698
we've also had conversations

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:55.265
about what the future of

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.466
California's budget looks like.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.103
And one of the questions I know

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.770
that at some of the folks that

00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:02.839
have followed that the hearings

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.274
at the state level have heard me

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:04.908
ask that I want to ask locally

00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:06.343
is.

00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:08.511
What are we doing to prepare for

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:10.513
the next recession --

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:14.250
As a campus --

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:16.386
And some predict sooner rather

00:54:16.453 --> 00:54:18.421
than later and how are we

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.390
preparing so that we don't see --

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:23.026
Some of the elements that we've

00:54:23.093 --> 00:54:24.561
seen in past recessions that

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:26.630
results in you know I mean if

00:54:26.696 --> 00:54:28.298
you look at the history that's

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:28.832
when tuition has gone the

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.700
highest rate in the period of

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.469
recessions --

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.136
And so forth and that's also a

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:34.871
very difficult time but what is

00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:35.472
the campus doing now to think

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:38.642
about that.

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.310
Yeah I would say.

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:40.744
That if you know.

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:53.657
Our role Martin and I share the

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:56.359
role of really being careful

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:56.860
stewards of our funds.

00:54:56.926 --> 00:55:00.397
And so as we work on our Alex is

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:04.734
a fun. One the permanent fund

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:06.736
and hear we permanent commitment

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:07.003
and that.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.772
Also is is can extrapolate to a

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:10.473
staff member or faculty member

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.041
and so it's really got to do

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:11.274
with --

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.676
Hiring people so the more the

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:14.310
more are --

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:14.911
We would add to our work force

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.780
the more we'd have a an ongoing

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:17.313
obligation that would be

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.848
severely impacted in the budget

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:19.049
cuts.

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.450
And so I think it's a campus

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:21.017
we've been frugal about our

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:22.485
staffing and we've been --

00:55:22.552 --> 00:55:24.554
We we've been a campus that

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.255
looks at how can we do more with

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.489
less.

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.358
And have focused on that we are --

00:55:28.425 --> 00:55:30.560
In a in a period where we're

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.328
really looking at our the

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:34.597
funding gaps that started in two

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.499
thousand eight and how we

00:55:36.566 --> 00:55:37.033
address those I think an

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.768
important dialogue we're gonna

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.336
be having on our campus in the

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:42.338
next couple of years is.

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:42.972
Your what programs are really

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.374
important to continue --

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.643
What programs maybe shouldn't

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.211
continue and that's never an

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.480
easy conversation to have that's

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:51.014
something that can help

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.415
safeguard us but it's really

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.484
taking a look at where where are

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:56.319
permanent obligations and where

00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:56.619
are our --

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.855
Less permanent obligations in

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:00.690
trying to understand how we

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:02.692
balance that I think we ban --

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.661
We've been encouraging.

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.362
Folks -- To

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.531
to look at their funds it and

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.600
occasionally we have --

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:12.368
Some give funds where we really

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.404
encourage folks to put those

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:16.406
into funds functioning as

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:16.940
announcements where they

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:18.575
generate some interest revenue.

00:56:18.641 --> 00:56:20.443
During the period with which

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.412
they aren't spent so sometimes

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:23.012
will receive some source of

00:56:23.079 --> 00:56:24.280
funding.

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.416
It's intended to be spent over a

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:27.050
seven to ten year period and we

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.451
know that spending periods

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:30.487
coming a little later.

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:31.020
And so we're talking about

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:32.622
investing that money right now

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.657
so it yields some interest

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:36.259
return and that the mean time --

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:36.960
We're trying whatever we can to

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:38.595
make ourselves a little bit more

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:40.396
recession proof.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:42.332
I think that --

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:44.367
The budget cuts weeks uber

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:46.369
really difficult for our campus

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:48.505
and we've struggle to get our

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:50.573
faculty FTP back up to the

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:50.974
levels they work.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.909
In two thousand seven eight and

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:54.444
where we're barely there.

00:56:54.511 --> 00:56:56.312
And so -- I

00:56:56.379 --> 00:56:56.913
would say we certainly haven't

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.748
gone and over spent at present

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:02.452
and so that that will in another

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.521
itself protect us a bit --

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:08.391
But I think looking at the

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.025
watchful answer P. and really

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.760
growing outside of our campus

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.629
has been an important part

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:13.029
wherever we can.

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.631
Look at something is creating

00:57:14.697 --> 00:57:16.499
revenue is equally important

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:18.234
quite frankly we seen a greater

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:20.703
sharing of campus obligations.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.839
And financial obligations with

00:57:22.906 --> 00:57:24.808
auxiliaries on our campus where

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.543
we've we've taken the entities

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.411
that are revenue generating and

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.547
ask them to carry more of the

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:32.182
work of the love so.

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:34.317
Some of those strategies have

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.286
been helping us as well just.

00:57:36.352 --> 00:57:38.388
The most important strategy up

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.657
off all what we talk about is

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:40.890
tenth.

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:42.892
We have gone through several

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.561
recessions are myself going

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:44.894
through it.

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.596
But I think one of the most

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:48.431
important principle is that.

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:50.366
We should have developed the

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:50.867
principles that that.

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:54.370
No matter what we do.

00:57:54.437 --> 00:57:58.474
We must not a come.

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.310
So with these two large

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:02.378
principles then we make the

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.514
budget cut and trim and also.

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:06.683
We we do it very carefully --

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.818
With all what it Chuck just

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.486
mention about --

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:14.290
The waste to to to to to if it

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:16.259
comes to a recession.

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:20.363
But we will I think education.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.630
Quality.

00:58:20.697 --> 00:58:22.665
And diversity of the most

00:58:22.732 --> 00:58:24.367
important principle that.

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:26.269
We must not compromise.

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.638
Just to add --

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.239
To what Chuck was saying in

00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.373
terms of tactics so are

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.508
permanent budget has been

00:58:32.575 --> 00:58:33.176
growing there's been enrollment

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.446
growth instead of having the the

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:37.080
permanent budget grow exactly

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:38.882
with enrollment we've tried to

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.483
be a little more conservative

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:42.652
with that and maybe like a year

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.654
or two what if and Roman.

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:45.288
Pope pulled back but what if

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:46.656
there were other pressures so

00:58:46.723 --> 00:58:48.524
that's the specific tactic we've

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:50.593
done with various fund sources --

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:56.466
Ticket that cushion at Chuck

00:58:56.532 --> 00:59:00.236
described.

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.372
I see here on the the non

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.574
residents enrollment that of

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.209
course has been a hot issue in

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:08.411
the state legislature last

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.680
year's and up assembly pushed

00:59:10.747 --> 00:59:12.448
very hard couple years ago the

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.250
region's adopted.

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.352
Happen in this faster in the

00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:18.221
budget the Senate actually adopt

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:18.788
a language trying to go. To

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:22.392
lower lower numbers and so

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.127
that's you know would be nice as

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:24.327
well.

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.663
And and so he for a lot of the

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.231
campus is it's it's made a huge

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.233
chunk of the revenue to to

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.602
basically you know keep it going.

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:36.272
And so sub campuses like.

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:36.906
LA in Brooklyn San Diego they

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:42.578
have you know more.

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.179
More money per student and so

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:43.413
there.

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:44.647
Academic quality you could argue

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.349
is little bit different than at

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.518
number Saturday riverside which

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.687
had some some of the lower lower

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.220
number so looks like Santa

00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.655
Barbara's kind of in the middle

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:54.324
of the season but you have.

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.292
Gone up the last five years from

00:59:56.359 --> 00:59:56.926
from five two to sixteen and so

00:59:56.993 --> 01:00:00.330
I assume that's been a big chunk.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:04.334
Of on my revenue and some some --

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.371
Some of the a like this but

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.206
they're able to utilize their

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:10.473
Medical.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.642
Center revenue to help make a go

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.410
of it so.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.646
In mice my district I have UC

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.247
Davis.

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.416
I represent not the campus that

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:21.084
that the Medical Center which is

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.320
a huge part of the UC Davis

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:26.289
enterprise in LA --

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.691
San Diego of course and so --

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.560
Maybe you can paint a picture of

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.362
Santa Barbara how you're able.

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:34.397
To how it impacts the you know

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.499
the average experience for your

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:37.033
undergraduate students.

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.768
With not having the Medical

01:00:38.835 --> 01:00:42.305
Center and what you've been able

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.207
to wear the monies go from the

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:46.242
increase revenue --

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.144
For international and non and

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:48.678
out of state students and

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.346
conversely if you didn't have

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.715
that what it would look like for

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:52.982
instance.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:54.484
Yakin talk about the non

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.419
resident part for yeah so I

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.421
don't we have a four hundred

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.055
twenty two million dollars as of

01:00:59.122 --> 01:01:00.523
budget to sure from student

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:00.957
tuition and fees.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.558
And a hundred and thirteen

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:04.427
million of that is the non

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.362
resident students.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.498
Border directly yet 27% of that.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:12.602
And and as you mentioned that's

01:01:12.668 --> 01:01:14.203
grown over the last --

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:18.541
In a address the other.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:20.209
Well I would just say that the

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:20.810
you know it has become an

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:22.745
important source of revenue for

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.547
the campus it's a what I would

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:28.217
call perhaps more flexible form

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.353
of revenue and so --

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:30.887
It's something that we've

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:31.187
utilized --

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.822
We've covered some dead expenses

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.524
with that we certainly have been

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.492
dedicating those dollars towards

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.227
a deferred maintenance program

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:38.594
we mentioned --

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.630
There been a number of of

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:42.365
programs around student success

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:44.467
some of the program's you'll

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.335
hear about today --

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:46.869
We've also been making

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:48.504
investments is sustainability

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.339
with some of those dollars --

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.341
And that's been a really

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.009
important one for us because it

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.744
has a kind of a two for a fact

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.479
it's meeting our goals as a

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.314
campus for sustainability.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.450
But it's also managed to corral

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:04.587
all our utilities expenses and

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:06.923
it's a bit over that period of

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.224
time.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.393
But our energy use has not.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.361
And so that's from some of those

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.797
investments coming that way --

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:18.568
I would just say in principle

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:19.102
and in the end. For me

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.603
philosophically as I look at non

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.338
resident tuition.

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.207
It's not the most comfortable

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.242
source of revenue for me as a

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.943
manager on the campus because it

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.411
it puts us.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:40.857
Reliant on the economy of other

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.492
countries and as long as those

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:42.992
economies are generating

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:43.292
[inaudible]

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.260
Revenue.

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.762
And you know they're productive

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:48.264
a nothing.

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:52.268
Being their students.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:52.935
Does make me worry when we have

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.337
a potentially in a

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.506
disproportionate amount of what

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:57.140
we're counting on is permanent

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.407
budget coming from --

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.443
Other nations and whatever their

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.378
economic policies are so.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.012
There's volatility associated

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.313
with that I don't think it is a

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:04.947
you know something that should

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:06.782
be a long term strategy to say

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:10.386
keep growing that in river and

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.020
in support of other funds going

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:14.323
away right now are.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.557
Total.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:18.494
Non resident rather revenues

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.496
equal to about 50% of our state

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.331
support.

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.200
So it it it is a significant

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:24.634
chunk of money --

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.602
On the campus that we are

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.404
reliant on but it it does worry

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:28.571
me.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:32.208
So that the policy that the

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:32.608
region's adopted.

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.644
Now two years ago.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:38.381
Have had a cap of no more than

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.249
18% for those other.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:42.218
Campuses that were already about

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:42.818
twenty correct so that means

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:43.019
that.

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.320
Right now.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.656
Santa Barbara here at 16% yeah

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.491
non resident and you could.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:52.328
Legally go up to eighteen right

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:56.365
yes is that the plan.

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.334
I don't know I think we've you

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.369
know we we have not made such a

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:01.037
plan nobody you know I have to

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.340
say although state is not just

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:04.974
in our nine out of standing many

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:08.244
out of California and other

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.646
forty nine states still counts.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:14.283
Yeah yeah.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.185
Is there a huge.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:16.719
Demand you have way more

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.621
applications for non resident.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.389
Than you do slots available I

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:20.890
would have to have --

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.425
Or director admissions answer

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:22.992
that I believe that is the

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:24.727
ACLU's you see why I know that

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:28.231
yeah even even when we increased.

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:30.533
Non resident we feet there

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.535
hasn't even though the whatever

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.403
elasticity.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:35.037
Study with us right hasn't had

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.706
much of a drop so in other words

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:36.906
even.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:42.311
There's a huge demand we could

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:44.213
internationally and other states

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.249
nine the non resident tuition

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:48.217
combined with our tuition your

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.519
housing expenses and we have you

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.321
know there's a policy that

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.323
there's no financial aid.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.292
Provided to non residents so

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:58.494
there we were competing with you

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.329
know what what may be the cost

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.231
of other --

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:02.765
You know prime ivy league

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.667
schools into whether we've price

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.769
yourself out of that market I

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:08.604
think Lisa can talk about that

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.239
when she's up here --

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:12.308
It it -- But

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.277
obviously by going from.

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.479
In in the last eight years.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.447
You've quadrupled from four to

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:20.483
sixteen so there is a demand

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.318
people are there is only about

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:22.885
the Santa Barbara story of

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.687
course you could walk out and

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.188
see the beautiful ocean.

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:30.526
And and I think probably work

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.295
it's out.

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:34.430
The other people or from your

01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:36.499
home state or for the country

01:05:36.565 --> 01:05:36.966
and so forth about the

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:40.436
experience you're finding and

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:44.373
you see SB certainly --

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.509
The the one thing I did want to

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.143
bring up though that that you

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.411
had mentioned that.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:49.078
The the language from the Senate

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.713
about reducing yeah nonresident

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.381
rolling down --

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.884
To down 210% of enrollment that

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:55.551
that impact for our campus would

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:56.319
be about forty two million

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:56.986
dollars of what we would can now

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:58.521
call permanent funding.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:02.325
That's that's almost equivalent

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:06.329
to was for a for UCSB when the

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.230
UC experience a very large

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:08.664
budget cuts so it.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.800
Is significant let me ask want

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:12.234
one more question about student

01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.537
fees and I'm guessing is very

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:14.837
unpopular.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.441
But but sometimes I wonder. For

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.376
the student fee increases if we

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:22.445
shouldn't go forth with it in

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:26.215
the first place because it

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.284
really boils down.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:30.319
To upper middle class students

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.321
who who are impacted I think I'm

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.390
not sure the number here at UC

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.057
Santa Barbara finding is that.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:38.194
Well over half the students.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.596
A new no tuition and all other

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.865
cal grant of power is it two

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.500
thirds it happens.

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.167
It's it's over half I don't know

01:06:45.234 --> 01:06:46.902
that number right off the top of

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.270
my head we probably have it here

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:48.571
and then.

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:50.406
A few years ago we adopted the

01:06:50.473 --> 01:06:52.408
middle class scholarship so now

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.543
we go up to find. Two thirds of

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.612
tuition for income I think it's

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.447
up to now hundred and seventy

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.416
thousand dollars roughly better.

01:07:00.483 --> 01:07:02.451
For a family of four and so.

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:06.389
You know that's a great.

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:08.457
Who are some of the suits a so?

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.359
If it comes down.

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:10.993
To in you when you build your

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.695
budgets you're looking for a

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.930
minor saying is kind of a three

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.298
piece --

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:20.336
Stole yeah non resident money

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.571
state monies to get the money

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.409
yep and so.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:27.042
Sometimes I just wonder is it

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:30.379
worth I know that students.

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:30.980
Student fees like the holy --

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.615
Third rail --

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:36.318
And I get it but you know for

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:36.919
many many students who come in

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.687
and talk about the student fee

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:40.923
increases we ask them like that

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.358
they'll pay tuition anyway yeah

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:42.992
because they get financial like

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.393
some.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:46.695
I see some students screaming

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.697
back yeah and I I I think that

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:48.964
that is.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:52.268
Most likely an unpopular idea I

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:54.437
from a from a purely economic

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:54.737
standpoint.

01:07:54.804 --> 01:07:55.371
There there is a large segment

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:56.739
of our enrollment that has their

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.574
tuition cover into the idea of

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.309
raising their tuition.

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.545
The return to a component of

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:03.179
that raise tuition insurers that

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.816
they in fact this portion of the

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.417
population is in paying it --

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.186
It'd shifting that expense

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.655
burden to the higher income

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.323
state not.

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:25.568
That's the economics of it.

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:28.237
The I you know somewhere around

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:28.871
two thousand and eight nine was

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:32.274
when we kind of the path.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.343
Being being equal.

01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:38.414
To two I'm in a back then. For

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.048
for the for the budget now its

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.649
way to where you know the

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.284
students are paying 37% and the

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:44.386
state's at nineteen and so that.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.020
That's released swayed quite a

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.322
bit and so I think that their

01:08:46.388 --> 01:08:46.922
you know there's a there's a

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.224
concern about --

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:48.557
Is is -- If

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.759
the unit if the state can't

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:51.427
restore funding similar to where

01:08:51.494 --> 01:08:52.761
it had been before that pressure

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.597
will naturally moved towards.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:54.864
Tuition.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.699
I would just say for myself when

01:08:56.765 --> 01:09:00.603
I came here as was two hundred

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:01.237
forty eight dollars a quarter.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.538
You know it's it it was a long

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.507
long time ago and the state was

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:08.310
in a much different style places

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:08.944
well you're depriving it's an

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:09.612
important question because it's

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.281
a reality check as as as

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:12.882
literally months that we've

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.583
we've had a five year run.

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:16.752
In the economy California budget

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:20.222
like no other in a hundred years

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:22.391
and it's not going to continue.

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:22.958
And it just the laws of

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:24.460
economics are gonna have a

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.428
reality check in your future so.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:28.430
We have to to to weigh those

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.432
things out I will note that in

01:09:30.499 --> 01:09:30.933
this one thing we always

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.268
perspective.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:34.436
It is that the state increase

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.104
has gone down but that student

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:36.472
be revenue keep in mind that a

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:38.374
bunch that state money as well

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.276
as a we increased.

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:42.811
Fees ready pay them the counter

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:44.647
in the grant program so read

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.415
look as how much money from the

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.016
state California checkbooks

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.317
going to pay.

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.452
For college you may not all be

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:52.488
going. To you see what it goes

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.323
the student commission and back

01:09:54.390 --> 01:10:02.498
door to see so it's still is

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:14.009
yeah cal grant it's just.

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:14.276
Yeah yeah.

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:14.476
Okay.

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:14.944
Thank you this was --

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:15.210
Helpful.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:15.811
And again there's there's no

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:16.478
magic so they were looking for

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:16.946
it is just helpful in

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:18.280
understanding the decisions we

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.516
make up beard Sacramento.

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:22.551
Impacts of cost [inaudible]

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:26.355
Scott.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:27.022
Conservative approach to funding

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:30.292
has any impact on your you know

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:30.859
the folks who work here.

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.661
And I know that for graduate

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:33.228
students one of the keys to

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.263
getting.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:34.897
Could graduate students is being

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.265
able.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:38.300
To and I know that the

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:38.801
university has had some

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.536
challenges because we don't

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:40.903
offer them --

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.705
Particularly much and instead of

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.640
coming to UCSB they go to the

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.542
university of Texas or some

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.277
other ungodly place.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:48.811
And you know it makes it

01:10:48.877 --> 01:10:52.314
difficult for us to keep to

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:52.781
sustain that quality.

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:54.750
Of educational experience those

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.585
researchers are helpful to the

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.621
professors who want to have

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.189
those students.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:00.856
The top in a we want the cream

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.591
of the cream here to be.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:06.295
Our students so it's a it's of a

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:06.962
yin and the Yang here we're not.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.364
By being frugal --

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:12.368
It's sometimes does also cost us

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.035
the quality of of student that

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.570
we're looking for particularly

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:26.515
in the graduate level so.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.383
I'm mindful of that and I

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.651
appreciate the question what are

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:30.686
we doing the next recession hits

01:11:30.753 --> 01:11:32.488
big [inaudible]

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.223
Refer people.

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.225
Thing is that we and so.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:38.193
Contributed the school I don't

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.861
know how much more we can expect

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.396
them to do --

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:44.366
Any more longer grandkids we can

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:44.566
real.

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.335
Well.

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.303
I I will stand silent on that

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:48.904
but there certainly are folks

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.439
out there who do appreciate this

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:50.906
great university --

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:52.274
But that we can't rely on that.

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:56.412
For our programs okay thank you

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.580
thank you with us today this

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.349
panel next we're gonna have a

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:01.016
handle on in Romans outcomes the

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.284
student services.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:06.422
So please come on up. For for

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:22.538
participants

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:24.373
.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.442
Thank you chair McCarty.

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:28.477
Assembly member Monique and

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.612
senator Jackson I'm Jeff stop

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.481
will associate vice chancellor

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.483
for undergraduate education.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.084
With me here is Linda Adler

01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.485
Kassner faculty director for the

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:38.554
center of innovative teaching

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.222
research and learning.

01:12:40.289 --> 01:12:40.889
We appreciate the opportunity to

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.791
talk with you about UC Santa

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:43.425
Barbara innovative three sixty

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.593
degree support for achievement

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.127
of our rigorous learning

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.162
outcomes.

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.663
Would like to thank the

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.399
legislature for this

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:50.933
accomplished the number.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.601
Is noted our student body is

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:54.269
also increasingly diverse 30%

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.305
identifies under represented

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:58.540
minorities and 41% are first

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:00.375
generation college students.

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.344
Also emphasize that we are the

01:13:02.411 --> 01:13:03.011
first member of the prestigious

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:04.480
association of American

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.482
universities to be certified as

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.383
a Hispanic serving institution.

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:10.486
Additionally of note is that 30%

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.554
of our students come from

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.490
families with an income below

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.291
fifty thousand dollars a year.

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:16.925
This matter is for learning.

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:18.961
Family income correlates most

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.462
strongly with educational

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.364
preparation and achievement. One

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:24.733
consequence is a gap in GPA and

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.802
time to completion for some of

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:28.804
the students. To address this

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.606
gap we've created innovative

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.274
programs to develop a thriving

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:32.541
learners.

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.443
We referred to them as three

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.977
hundred and sixty degree

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.645
programs because they support

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.213
learners and faculty.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.516
We know that learning is a two

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:42.551
way street students need to be

01:13:42.618 --> 01:13:44.386
prepared to learn from faculty

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:45.053
and faculty need to know how to

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.688
best invite students into a

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.323
learning process.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.991
After all learning is something

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:50.826
that someone does not something

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:52.461
done to them.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.897
Learning takes practice feedback

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:58.367
from experts and time.

01:13:58.433 --> 01:13:58.934
Our programs help students

01:13:59.001 --> 01:13:59.501
develop three parts of an

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.702
equation that lead to success in

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.638
college and beyond.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:04.239
Disciplinary knowledge skills

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:06.375
for academic and career success.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.544
And senses of themselves as

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.279
learners.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:10.779
Wilshire illustrations a

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:11.313
programs we've created in

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.681
conjunction with each piece of

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.283
this equation.

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:16.351
Also share with you ways we hope

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.287
you can help us advances work.

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:20.923
First or two academic success

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.457
centers --

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:24.526
Beyond us or opening new doors

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:28.297
for exhilarating six engine.

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:28.931
And a transfer student center.

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.499
Both support entering students

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.234
especially first generation and

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.536
low income students both opened

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.305
in.

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:36.972
Twenty fifteen donde center with

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.540
support from a two point five

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.275
million dollars H. us I grant

01:14:40.342 --> 01:14:40.809
from the US department of

01:14:40.876 --> 01:14:42.444
education.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.111
And the transfer student center

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.413
with support from one point six

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.348
million dollars in special

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.450
student success funding from the

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.352
UC office of the president.

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:50.919
Provide academic advising

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.387
academic mentoring.

01:14:52.454 --> 01:15:03.565
Structured opportunities for

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:06.435
students to get to know faculty

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.069
and workshops focusing on all

01:15:07.135 --> 01:15:10.272
aspects of cops life.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:10.572
More than.

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.374
Six thousand I visited centers.

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:16.345
More than. 140% of the campuses

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:18.480
Waldron elation in fact uses the

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.382
TSC regularly.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.049
Under us and the TSC illustrate

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.452
the comprehensive support that

01:15:23.518 --> 01:15:24.119
you see SB provides for students

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:24.786
to be our institutions rigorous

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.388
learning outcomes.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.590
Develop senses of belonging here.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.157
But three hundred and sixty

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:30.292
degree support also extends

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:30.692
beyond students.

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.728
We work with back across campus

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.395
to develop innovative pedagogies

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:34.263
to make their expertise more

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:34.930
accessible. For instance thirty

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.598
nine faculty have participated

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:37.099
in the yearlong seminar

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.600
supported by the department of

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.302
education title five grant.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:40.936
They redesigned assignments in

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:41.470
courses to improve student

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.304
learning.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.273
By the end of fall quarter

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:44.873
twenty eighteen these thirty

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.541
nine faculty will talk more than

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:48.210
thirty eight thousand students.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:50.646
That is only one example of this

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.414
kind of program efforts

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:54.449
contribute to improving students

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.351
learning and improving retention

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:56.818
and time to degree.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.587
Through all this work with

01:15:58.654 --> 01:15:59.221
faculty and students we have

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:02.491
identified important practices

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:03.058
that contribute to learning

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:03.292
gains.

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:04.226
Will show just two of them.

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:06.328
The first is incorporating

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.330
active learning and teaching.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.565
Sir Steve got gallons large

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.001
biological anthropology lecture

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.903
watch video lectures take online

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.672
quizzes and submit questions

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.407
about quirk course content in

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:20.342
advance of class meetings.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.678
In class they discuss the

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:23.312
questions with each other and

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:24.646
with professor gallon.

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:26.715
This active learning approach

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.583
makes the most of face to face

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.452
class time through interaction

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.387
and engagement.

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:32.888
Research shows that this

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:34.456
approach contributes

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:34.990
significantly to learning

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:36.658
especially among under

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.493
represented low income and first

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.295
generation students.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.531
The second is academic mentoring

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.599
especially from undergraduate

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:44.833
peers.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.835
Right now eight departments have

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:48.470
such programs which contribute

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.472
significantly to learning games.

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.541
We are also using technology for

01:16:52.607 --> 01:16:52.874
the support.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.276
We collaborate with university

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:54.876
of Michigan on each coach a

01:16:54.943 --> 01:16:56.545
technology platform that

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:58.447
provides course specific

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:00.449
coaching written by humans to

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.184
support learning and study

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.519
strategies tailored for students.

01:17:04.586 --> 01:17:05.120
You coach was initiated using

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.822
one point seven million dollars

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.490
in one time funding we received

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:09.124
from the legislature to support

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.625
low income students.

01:17:10.692 --> 01:17:12.294
Students from underrepresented

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.196
minority groups and students

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:16.331
enrolled and local control

01:17:16.398 --> 01:17:18.400
funding formula schools. To

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:20.635
conclude we want to identify two

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.404
ways we hope you can support our

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:22.938
three hundred sixty degree

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:24.539
approach.

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:25.073
First the legislature can

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.508
provide stable sustain support

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.443
for programs that help us close

01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:29.011
the achievement gap for all

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.412
learners.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.046
The programs we described here

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:34.282
have been supported by stood.

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:34.883
Rents like the one from the

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:36.518
department of education.

01:17:36.585 --> 01:17:38.587
And Elsie FF plus funding from

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.288
the legislature.

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:42.391
Of these only student success

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:42.991
funding from you see okay as

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:44.192
permanent.

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:44.826
The campus is trying to sustain

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.561
funding for these programs and

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:48.563
others like them the support

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.365
timely degree and success.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:54.302
Second you can help us create

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:54.970
As we've noted that everyone has

01:17:55.037 --> 01:17:56.505
you see SB is one of the most

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:58.340
beautiful campuses on the

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.007
outside but classrooms and labs

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.475
as you've noted don't

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.310
necessarily match the exterior.

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:04.379
We don't have space for a

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:04.980
booming student population.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.715
Learning spaces are in desperate

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.483
need of renovation built at a

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:20.162
time when we knew less about the

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:20.829
importance of active learning

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.764
pedagogies for learning games.

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:26.468
The support is critical even as

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:26.701
we plan.

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.437
Classroom [inaudible]

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:32.274
And for efforts.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.276
For funding and that is.

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:34.876
The state can help us make a

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.545
difference here at UCSB.

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:37.045
And more importantly a

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.513
difference for California like

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.181
you we believe that all of our

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.482
students are learners and

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.049
citizens and together we can

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.417
build a better future.

01:18:42.484 --> 01:18:44.352
Thank you ammo for to any

01:18:44.419 --> 01:18:46.288
questions you have.

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:48.390
Elected team --

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:52.194
DJing.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.296
I get a lot.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:54.963
Of us on our to show one of the

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:58.500
things if I may Mister yes --

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.502
Jump in here of one of the

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.804
things that we look for in the

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.573
legislature and is frequently --

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:06.641
Lacking the some metrics.

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:08.343
So.

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:08.977
How much money have you spent

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.545
how many students have you

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:11.213
dressed water the success levels

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.781
how are you measuring success?

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:14.282
We're going to put more money in

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:14.916
and help make this permit which

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:18.453
is what I yeah well it's working

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.522
graduation rates take time to to

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.056
measure we hope to see

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.657
improvements in graduation rates --

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:24.426
Particular for the transfer

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:24.726
students --

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.361
Is.

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.363
That's a real concern for us.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.465
I think that will be important

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.367
Telesat I mean if you have a

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.369
program that works.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:35.036
I suspect we're going to want to

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:38.340
implement that elsewhere if it's

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:38.940
the best program out there but

01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:52.454
that is I think something that --

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.121
Becomes important this is tell

01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:56.658
us how how well it's it's a call.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:20:00.395
School I'm.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:00.962
We absolute Kerr with that

01:20:01.029 --> 01:20:02.297
assessment Dreamland.

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:06.201
The main areas.

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:08.603
Work and work as the redwood

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.739
education. One of the challenges

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.174
is that learning games take time

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:12.841
to manifest themselves so if we

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:14.409
implemented.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:14.743
Intervention.

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.511
It could have short term results

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:17.179
can have different kinds of long

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.747
term results and so we have data

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:19.314
on some of the short term

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:20.649
results of some of these and we

01:20:20.715 --> 01:20:21.283
just decided to a sort of sweet

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:24.486
of kinds of interventions and

01:20:24.553 --> 01:20:25.153
program so we have data on some.

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:26.254
Of them.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.490
But twenty fifteen is not long

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.592
ago so we need more time so you

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:30.892
measuring.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.327
The students whether that

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.396
graduating or not what what if

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.298
some of them are at risk of it

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:38.533
is the goals the goal to see

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.335
them graduate is the goal to see

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.002
them get jobs as a goal to see

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:42.504
them get ago want to get.

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.606
Other degrees so made those are

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:45.207
things I think that would be

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.841
helpful for us to know what it

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.410
is you're measuring right yes

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:50.145
programs are specifically

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:50.779
focused I think and and getting

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:52.480
students to graduate on time

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.416
there's a lot of other.

01:20:54.482 --> 01:20:56.384
Wonderful thing state.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:57.018
In the camps is doing in terms

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.653
of steering students into

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.254
graduate programs when that's

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.589
appropriate action their

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.724
scholars and you see leads and

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:06.828
many others we didn't just to

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:10.632
focus on the the job thing is.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.667
Trickier for us to get a handle

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:14.536
on that our office doesn't have

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.538
that kind of data unfortunately

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.406
that's where they go we know

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:19.040
Francis so one of the programs

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:20.675
that I mentioned was that this

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:22.310
you coach which is that tailored

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:22.877
coaching program written by

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:25.080
humans for students --

01:21:25.146 --> 01:21:25.747
So we have data from the initial

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:26.414
pilot runs of that.

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:27.082
Intervention in a one of our big

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.150
introductory biology courses and

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:29.784
we've seen some very positive

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:30.819
results but that means for

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:31.486
example that we seem changes in

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.322
students --

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:34.823
Self their believes in

01:21:34.889 --> 01:21:36.424
themselves of students their

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:36.992
study behaviors their study

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.994
practices there are grades from

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.395
one biology course of the next

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:42.697
biology course but that's but in

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:43.331
the time that we've had that's

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:44.566
those of the metrics we can

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:46.601
collect right now.

01:21:46.668 --> 01:21:50.305
So some of the longer term --

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.407
Interventions like --

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:54.709
Changes and faculty members

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.444
teaching practices most take

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:58.213
longer time to collected on any

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.282
other questions.

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:00.882
All right so I think we will

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:01.082
have.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.417
The next.

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:06.421
Said a panelist great thank you.

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:07.055
A good afternoon I'm my name's

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.657
Lisa press Cup I served as the

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.525
director of admissions.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.427
I've probably worked for the

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:13.094
department of admission since my

01:22:13.161 --> 01:22:16.798
graduation in. Nineteen eighty

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:17.332
five thirty three years if

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:18.533
you're doing the math.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.167
I thought it would be best to

01:22:19.234 --> 01:22:20.635
start with the mission of the

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:22.637
office of admissions quite

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:24.606
simply were charged with and

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.608
rolling the student body that

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.142
demonstrates high academic

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.243
achievement.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.478
Exceptional personal talent.

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.614
And reflects the diversity of

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:37.319
California by providing services

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:37.886
to families and educational

01:22:37.952 --> 01:22:38.420
professionals throughout

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:40.255
California.

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:40.922
Our services can be broken down

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.524
into the following categories

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.559
statewide outreach.

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.528
Application services online

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:50.532
services and counselor services.

01:22:50.598 --> 01:22:51.199
Statewide outreach includes in

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:53.034
person visits with students from

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.736
as far south as San you cedar

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.638
high school near the Mexican

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.973
border. To the northern most

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.475
unity college in California

01:23:00.542 --> 01:23:02.243
college of the Siskiyou this

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:04.412
which is fifty miles south of

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:04.879
the Oregon border --

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.648
Application services unit

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:10.318
ensures each application is

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:10.785
thoroughly reviewed.

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.587
In preparation to submit the

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.322
nineteen you see applications

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:16.524
students can view the tutorial

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:18.393
that we've created and posted to

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:18.593
you.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.695
To the tutorial is received

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:22.797
nearly eleven thousand views.

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.299
Is commonly used by California

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.634
counselors to advise students on

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.236
their campuses.

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.538
Yes he has been on UCSB is

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.640
online tools insure families who

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:34.642
lacked the ability to travel to

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:35.210
campus have access to the

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.711
information they need to prepare

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.546
for the university.

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.448
These tools were created at the

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.384
suggestive counselors from low

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.319
resource California high schools

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:44.986
who expressed concern that their

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:46.688
families did not have the

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:48.723
resources to visit each UC

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.458
campus.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.092
While these tools are available

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:52.694
to anyone with internet access

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:56.498
approximately 85% of the users

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:58.366
are from California.

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.535
Lastly our our cancer services

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.637
provide tools and resources that

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:03.238
school personnel used to best

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.839
serve their students.

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:07.375
The office of admissions is

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:08.710
comprised of fifty dedicated

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:10.812
staff members many of whom are

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:11.012
used.

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.781
Graduates all are passionate

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:14.949
about creating educational

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:15.183

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.684
Many of our staff myself

01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:20.688
included since we understand the

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:22.290

On the path to attain in a

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.428

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.028
I'd like to highlight some

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.763
examples of our successes and

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.331
I'll follow that with some

01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:30.899

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.335
Families in California.

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.971

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.579

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.518
initiatives.

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:51.152
Personal attention matters when

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:52.821
it comes to making crucial

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.656

pride in the personal service.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.893
An example of this would be our

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.595

01:30:58.319 --> 01:31:00.254
appointments online chats

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.356
virtual classroom presentations

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.559
to Abbott classrooms and online

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:06.460
college fairs.

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:07.128
We also have an expansive array

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:08.663
of videos available to students

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:10.298
on our you tube site with

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:12.466
specific videos produced for

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.335
African American Chicano Latino

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.437
transfer and foster youth.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:17.104
Again these online services are

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:20.675
used for students and counselors

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.643
for instance 89% of our weapon

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.247
our viewers are from California.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.449
We do face some challenges as we

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:28.950
create and implement our

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:30.685
outreach services.

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.753
Success can be hampered if our

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.722
funding is not consistent across

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:36.724
fiscal years in general most

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.593
successful initiatives take two

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.461
to three years to fully mature.

01:31:40.528 --> 01:31:42.797
And to take root in California

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:44.599
high schools and community

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:44.866
colleges.

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.734
What we're tremendously grateful

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:48.603
for any new funding even one

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.504
time funding if the funding is

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:52.406
one year only it is more

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:53.074
challenging to realize long term

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:54.275
results?

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.611
Comprehensive review of the

01:31:56.677 --> 01:31:58.412
application --

01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:02.250
Is critical --

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.318
We need to fully understand the

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.320
talents of a particular student

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.289
beyond just GPA and SAT.

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.324
Review and a hundred and ten

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:12.360
thousand of those applications

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:14.528
is a massive undertaking --

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:15.196
We use a team of about a hundred

01:32:15.263 --> 01:32:16.898
and fifty readers that must

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.432
complete this arduous task in

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:20.835
about ten to twelve weeks time.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.503
Applications are far more

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:24.605
complex than when I began in

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.574
this profession for example

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:28.309
California community colleges

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.411
are offering a very large array

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.713
of border called dual enrollment

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:32.980
classes.

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.315
Community college courses

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:36.751
offered on the high school

01:32:36.817 --> 01:32:36.984
campus.

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.419
Many high school students are

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:38.986
completing these courses in

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.721
addition they're taking online

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:42.690
courses there attending summer

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.492
programs at different colleges

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.360
and universities.

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:46.961
So these programs definitely

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.663
make it didn't more prepared for

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:50.831
university level work but it

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.600
definitely creates a much more

01:32:52.667 --> 01:33:08.416
complex application to review.

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.751
The mandated two to one ratio of

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.420
men to trance moment

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:12.720
[inaudible]

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:14.488
Actually [inaudible]

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:14.855
Camp [inaudible]

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.390
Related [inaudible]

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:18.359
See.

01:33:18.426 --> 01:33:18.993
There are two community because

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.661
Santa Barbara county.

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.296
Combined those two community

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:24.532
colleges bring us only 17% 1718%

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:28.369
of our total transfer enrollment.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.003
So that basically means we are

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:32.239
far more reliant than other.

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:32.873
UC's to bring in out of area

01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:36.277
students to campus to hit that

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:36.844
two to one mandated ratio.

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:38.346
Average to special populations

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:38.879
such as under represented

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:39.413
minority groups transfer

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:40.715
students veterans and foster

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:41.315
youth require time intensive

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.383
services.

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.017
Again our geographic location

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:43.551
means that we must travel

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:46.554
throughout communities simply

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.823
put the geographic location of

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.491
Santa Barbara makes out reach

01:33:50.558 --> 01:33:54.428
more expensive.

01:33:54.495 --> 01:33:55.096
Demand for stem majors is at all

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.163
time high.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.299
This creates tremendous --

01:33:58.366 --> 01:33:58.933
Demand for lab space in teaching

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.601
assistants which has been

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:02.470
mentioned already today while

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:04.672
the campus is working to address

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:06.440
these issues it mission staff

01:34:06.507 --> 01:34:08.409
must work diligently. To help

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.578
students discover majors across

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.446
all disciplines.

01:34:12.513 --> 01:34:14.482
The type of specialty out reach

01:34:14.548 --> 01:34:16.450
program requires labor intensive

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:16.717
services.

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:18.652
Finally competition to enroll

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.588
our most talented under

01:34:20.654 --> 01:34:22.456
represented California students

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:22.757
is fierce.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.658
The biggest concern is financial

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:26.327
aid.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:27.028
Our low income families are near

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.796
panic when they see the total

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.498
cost of attendance and middle

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.433
income families are deterred by

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.368
fear of student loan debt.

01:34:34.435 --> 01:34:34.869
It mission cancer spend

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:36.504
significant time addressing

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.339
these concerns.

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.508
Colleges from outside California

01:34:40.574 --> 01:34:42.376
are now placing regional

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:42.877
representatives within

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:46.213
California to recruit our most

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:46.781
promising students away.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.549
These schools offer scholarships

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:50.718
that often cannot be matched by

01:34:50.785 --> 01:34:52.620
UC this is starkly black

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.488
colleges and universities now

01:34:54.555 --> 01:34:56.757
recruit heavily in California.

01:34:56.824 --> 01:35:00.428
And host college fairs it at key

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.229
California community colleges

01:35:02.296 --> 01:35:02.797
the H. B. C. use have also

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:04.765
developed guaranteed admission

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.233
programs with the California

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.536
community colleges that are

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:12.406
competing with the UC guarantee

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:12.673
programs.

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.475
I thank you for your time and

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.109
your interest in our out reach

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.477
programs I hope this interview.

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.479
This overview demonstrates our

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.314
passion for service --

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.183
And arguments California schools

01:35:22.249 --> 01:35:26.454
thank you [inaudible]

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:32.226
The given.

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:32.860
Good afternoon my name is Mike

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:34.195
Miller and I'm the assistant

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:34.829
vice chancellor for enrollment

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:35.096
services.

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:35.729
I'm here to share some of our

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:36.664
innovative work around critical

01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:38.666
issues like access affordability

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.634
and basic needs.

01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:42.536
Thanks to our generous financial

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:44.238
aid awards and several in the

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:44.839
several new programs around

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:46.640
student support UC Santa Barbara

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.642
was re recently ranked number

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:50.244
two in a New York times college

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.413
access index which ranks

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:53.013
colleges and universities for

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.582
their support of low income

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:56.417
students.

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.319
While we're proud of a number

01:35:58.385 --> 01:35:59.053
two ranking we also we also know

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.821
that we have a lot of work to do

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:02.389
and in these areas.

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:04.258
With the rising cost of higher

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:04.792
education and constantly

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.894
evolving needs of our students

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:08.496
UC Santa Barbara continues to

01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:10.264
look for ways to ensure student

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:10.531
success.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.566
As my colleagues have said

01:36:12.633 --> 01:36:14.268
predictable funding models are

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.437
vital when trying to plan ahead.

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:17.071
This is something our students

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.672
also struggle with traditional

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.708
financial aid models determine

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.376
eligibility on a year by year

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:22.610
basis.

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.512
This means low income first

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:26.680
generation college students

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:28.282
commit to a campus only knowing

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:28.849
how that they'll pay for one

01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:30.484
year of their education and are

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:32.386
often left to wonder about years

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.688
two three and four four years

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.290
ago UC Santa Barbara launch a

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:36.857
pilot program designed to

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.526
address this issue.

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:41.328
Call the UCSB promise scholar

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:41.595
program.

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.230
The program offers talented hide

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:46.333
high need incoming freshmen a

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.435
pretty well for your financial

01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:49.069
aid out outlook using existing

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:50.471
financial aid programs.

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:55.176
Transfer students are offered to

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:56.544
years of predictable funding

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.546
Kalra and services to ensure

01:36:58.612 --> 01:37:00.414
they thrive in the classroom as

01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:02.516
well as in the UCSB community.

01:37:02.583 --> 01:37:04.318
Here's what we've learned so far

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:04.952
the model a predictable funding

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:06.754
and wrap around services is

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.021
working.

01:37:07.087 --> 01:37:08.923
We currently have four hundred

01:37:08.989 --> 01:37:10.691
fifteen students in the in the

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.660
program and of those a hundred

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:13.294
and twenty three year in their

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.728
fourth year.

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.330
Of the students we welcome the

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:16.964
campus in the first year of the

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.866
program all but one remain

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:20.301
enrolled in on track to graduate.

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.670
A remarkable 93% are on trial

01:37:22.736 --> 01:37:24.872
are on track to graduate in four

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.440
years or less.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:28.409
Into date the overall GPA for

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.578
the entire program is a three

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:32.780
point. Three to put this in

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:33.280
perspective the average

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:34.682
household income of our promise

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:36.784
scholars is less than twenty

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:38.352
five thousand dollars a year.

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.721
Under normal sort circumstances

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:41.322
we know many of the students

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:42.656
would be at risk of having to

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:44.558
drop out or stop out there in

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.327
our academic careers.

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:46.894
Due to financial hardship.

01:37:46.961 --> 01:37:48.762
However however under our model

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:52.533
they are thriving graduating and

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.000
graduating on time.

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:55.035
Last fall UC Merced launched a

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.737
multi your financial aid program

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.539
and other UC campuses are

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.574
exploring similar similar

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:00.841
efforts.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.676
Another program we recently

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.511
implemented that is seeing

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:05.012
positive results is our

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:08.349
financial crisis response team.

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:08.949
National research shows that

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.551
when college students drop out

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:12.353
or stop out it is almost always

01:38:12.419 --> 01:38:13.020
due to financial obstacles that

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:14.588
tend to be less than five

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.423
hundred dollars.

01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:18.726
Last fall UCSB launch this this

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:19.360
program which is designed to

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:32.473
catch students before they fall

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.308
through the cracks.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:36.243
A diverse committee meets to

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.345
review student you.

01:38:38.412 --> 01:38:40.414
Can see five and also connect

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:42.349
with other can to research.

01:38:42.416 --> 01:38:44.385
The reason while.

01:38:44.451 --> 01:38:44.985
In the committee is currently

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:45.286
[inaudible]

01:38:45.352 --> 01:38:48.322
This.

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.424
It's who lost homes in both the

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:50.924
will see and campfires.

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:54.595
Last year the undergraduates who

01:38:54.662 --> 01:38:56.497
responded reported being food

01:38:56.563 --> 01:38:58.332
into care.

01:38:58.399 --> 01:38:58.966
With this in mind the global

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.434
food initiative and great

01:39:00.501 --> 01:39:02.603
efforts like SB eighty five were

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:02.870
launched.

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:04.638
UCSB is taken those resources in

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.206
implemented some impactful

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:08.375
programs to ensure our students

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:09.009
have access to help the in the

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.344
in nutritious foods.

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.546
Our faculty staff and students

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:13.113
are passionate about food

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:14.248
security.

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:16.650
Back in twenty eleven student

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:18.218
leaders launch the campus food

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:18.419
bank.

01:39:18.485 --> 01:39:20.454
In its first week of existence

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:22.356
the food banks are five students.

01:39:22.423 --> 01:39:24.558
Fast forward to today more than

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:26.360
sixteen hundred students per

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:30.264
week access the campus food bank.

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:30.898
You see SB is also leading the

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:32.299
way in terms of accessing the

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:32.733
cow fresh program.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.668
Nearly three last year nearly

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.270
three thousand students took

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:36.804
advantage of the program

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.605
resulting in over five million

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:39.239
dollars in purchasing power for

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:42.343
our students.

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:42.976
This year we're on pace or in

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.511
role in role six thousand

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:45.112
students in that program far

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:48.315
more than any other UC campus.

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:50.551
UCSB continues to educate

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:51.218
students on things like cooking

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:52.553
healthy meals shopping on a

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:54.421
budget and much more.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:56.623
The campus also recently broke

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.192
ground on a student farm which

01:39:58.258 --> 01:39:58.792
will supplier food bank with

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.394
fresh produce and service

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:02.429
service a laboratory for our

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:04.231
faculty and students.

01:40:04.298 --> 01:40:06.200
Thanks the funding from sources

01:40:06.266 --> 01:40:06.834
like SB eighty five you see SB

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.702
is quickly and effectively

01:40:08.769 --> 01:40:10.637
addressing food and security.

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.573
It is important to note the

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.441
leadership of assembly member

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:15.109
let alone around it SB eighty

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:16.477
five which is designed to create

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:18.612
hunger free campuses across

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:18.912
California.

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.614
This fall we also started a

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:22.583
housing voucher program to help

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:24.785
students were facing short term

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.286
housing emergencies.

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.255
Through the financial crisis

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:28.922
response team students can apply

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:30.524
for vouchers for up to five

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:31.125
hundred dollars which can be

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.726
used for on campus or off campus

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.294
housing situations.

01:40:34.361 --> 01:40:37.297
These are just a few of the

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:37.831
innovative and intentional

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:40.434
programs you see SB is created

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:42.970
to help students thrive wallop

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:43.270
and those.

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:44.538
Looking ahead many of these

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:45.172
programs have been started using

01:40:45.239 --> 01:40:48.709
one time funding funding sources

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.677
to ensure these programs remain

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:52.379
in place.

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.080
Thank you for your time and your

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:56.350
continued support.

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:56.617
Thank you.

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:58.385
Thank you [inaudible]

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:02.322
Question.

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:04.324
All.

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:06.360
Have if if yeah.

01:41:06.427 --> 01:41:08.395
So -- First

01:41:08.462 --> 01:41:12.466
of all as the in enrollment has

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.468
have a couple questions on that --

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:16.537
Obviously it's a cavity --

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:22.376
UC system and Santa Barbara.

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.478
It's just one of you could kind

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:24.912
of paint a picture.

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:26.580
The the odds of getting in.

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:28.415
Now.

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:30.651
Versus like ten years ago right

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:30.918
and then.

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:32.719
You know what's what's the

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:32.986
average.

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:36.256
GPA.

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.692
I don't has eighty seven that in

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.394
that first third --

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:42.296
Well.

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:44.264
To officially of the dead it is

01:41:44.331 --> 01:41:46.600
32% admit rate for UC Santa

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:47.201
Barbara at the freshman level

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.535
and 51% for transfer students.

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:49.136
So that means a third of the

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:50.437
students who apply will

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:52.272
ultimately be admitted to Santa

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:52.573
Barbara --

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:53.240
We definitely have become a much

01:41:53.307 --> 01:41:56.343
more competitive campus --

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.245
I would say from the point we

01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:09.022
were not selected but all.

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:12.426
That really has been a hard

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:14.394
thing. For the pulp but just.

01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:26.974
We now have --

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:27.608
Winners we are ranked number.

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:28.208
Five Robert or we tried to

01:42:28.275 --> 01:42:28.809
explain to students that we

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:29.476
really should not be considered

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:30.744
backup choice campus anymore

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:30.944
that.

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.713
Barb is the big leagues.

01:42:32.779 --> 01:42:38.252
And determine manned with

01:42:38.318 --> 01:42:40.587
[inaudible] Two average SAT is

01:42:40.654 --> 01:42:42.523
in the range of thirteen hundred

01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:44.491
plus.

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:46.493
And so if if your a at

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.395
communicable transfer student

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:48.662
your 50%.

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:50.664
Yeah community college transfer

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:51.164
student the average --

01:42:51.231 --> 01:42:52.266
Will we have our guarantee

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:52.533
program.

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:54.368
That -- Says

01:42:54.434 --> 01:42:54.801
of student has sixty

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:56.236
transferable units with the

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:56.770
three point two and a few

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:58.605
courses completed specifically

01:42:58.672 --> 01:42:59.172
in math and English they're

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:00.541
guaranteed admission to UC Santa

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:02.175
matter what community college

01:43:02.242 --> 01:43:02.709
there from no matter what

01:43:02.776 --> 01:43:04.678
community colleges so if.

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:06.179
If people come down here and

01:43:06.246 --> 01:43:08.348
role at Santa Barbara City

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:08.615
College.

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.617
Work we're gonna go visit them

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:14.421
tomorrow yes this do not --

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:16.323
A bit of an that that's out

01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.890
there that your chances are

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:18.258
better.

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:18.859
I think that the difference

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:20.661
would be cancers at Santa

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.296
Barbara City College are very

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:24.331
familiar with the C. S. B. R.

01:43:24.398 --> 01:43:24.932
departments and our selection

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:26.400
process.

01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.468
So students get very good

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:29.069
advising from the cancers at

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.804
Santa Barbara City College but a

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:32.573
student at college of the

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.341
sequoias has an equal chance.

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.577
Under the guarantee --

01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:38.478
So the guarantee isn't the to

01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:40.414
guarantee that they'll get in to

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.516
UCAS speed to guarantee they'll

01:43:42.583 --> 01:43:43.150
get into UC campus no it's a

01:43:43.216 --> 01:43:44.685
guarantee that they will get

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:46.420
into UC Santa Barbara. Six of

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:48.388
the UC campuses have campus

01:43:48.455 --> 01:43:52.392
specific guarantees use you

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:53.060
choose one campus you choose one

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:54.561
tag with.

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.430
Solar I'm a student at City

01:43:56.496 --> 01:43:58.599

College I have it's I have the

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:02.369
the minimum requirements I apply

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:02.970
to UCSB and I'm automatically

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:06.406
accepted.

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.375
Or whatever of the six campus.

01:44:08.442 --> 01:44:10.544
Actually retailing Davis three

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:11.244
point two in each each kelp each

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.246
you see that participated said

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:14.348
there own.

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:16.283
Criteria for their guarantee we

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.552
guarantee here's Santa Barbara

01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:18.986
Santa read point.

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.654
Two so again if you're at Santa

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:21.221
Barbara City College Santa

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:24.491
Monica San Diego three point two

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:30.230
sixty units --

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:30.864
A transferable math to transfer

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:36.637
but to community in Santa

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:38.705
Barbara county only represents

01:44:38.772 --> 01:44:40.774
17% of your transworld meant of

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:42.876
your enrollment of our transfer

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:44.678
enrollment each year show how

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:46.380
many students actually apply

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:48.548
from city college --

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.417
From from Santa Barbara city

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.352
it's a ballot between nine

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:54.621
hundred and a thousand I'd have

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:55.288
to pull the data from the most

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.723
recent years but it's it's

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:58.291
actually been declining because

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:02.462
Santa Barbara City College is a

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:08.201
moment has been declining.

01:45:08.268 --> 01:45:10.771
Yeah hi on the agenda it says

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:12.339
that -- The

01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:16.543
its it that increased by 30%.

01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:18.311
Community college transfers but

01:45:18.378 --> 01:45:20.414
Pressman has gone down right

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.582
transfer that's one thing too if

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:23.016
you look you know.

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.384
It's all great but for the

01:45:24.451 --> 01:45:26.520
California's family that we're

01:45:26.586 --> 01:45:28.388
talking about may times the

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.357
freshman it's that I Anderson

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:30.691
can of coke.

01:45:30.757 --> 01:45:32.626
And that's that in nineteen two

01:45:32.693 --> 01:45:45.872
thousand nine there is nineteen

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:46.473
thousand fifteen freshman and

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.140
this year. Nineteen three forty

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:47.307
so.

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.809
Comfortable over three hundred

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:52.412
more freshmen and non resident

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:58.552
increased. Seven thirty I rob.

01:45:58.618 --> 01:46:00.454
To that.

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.021
We get that question quite

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.322
frequently like like I tried to

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:02.889
say our priority is still

01:46:02.956 --> 01:46:04.558
California 86% of our outreach.

01:46:04.624 --> 01:46:05.225
That we conduct in the office is

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.326
California --

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:06.893
There is something called

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.428
compare favorably that our

01:46:08.495 --> 01:46:08.795
faculty hold.

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:10.530
All the campus is to and that is

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.165
all students must meet the same

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:14.501
academic standards so with the

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:18.338
number of applications we have

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:20.373
again trying to grow the campus

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.542
academic profile student is in

01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:24.478
the application pool.

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.446
Were evaluating all aspects of

01:46:26.513 --> 01:46:28.648
their application we do want

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:30.350
diversity whether it be

01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.419
geographical with in California

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:33.086
whether it be ethnic whether it

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:36.389
be national and global we do.

01:46:36.456 --> 01:46:38.692
Maintain a clear understanding

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:42.329
and belief in the region cap of

01:46:42.395 --> 01:46:44.531
18% the campus at Santa Barbara

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:46.500
is at 16% we feel like that

01:46:46.566 --> 01:46:48.435
gives our students --

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:50.403
Great global exposure --

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:52.739
The same time we're also

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.875
promoting our students to study

01:46:54.941 --> 01:46:55.442
abroad and bring back that

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.544
knowledge from their study

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:58.645
abroad program so we think

01:46:58.712 --> 01:47:01.748
predict balance right now

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:03.283
favorably we tighten up the law.

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:05.185
Last year's and now.

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:08.522
Yes specifically it can't be

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:11.158
does he have to equal to or

01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:11.725
better than the California

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:14.294
student for them we give me.

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:14.628
Thirds yeah.

01:47:14.694 --> 01:47:16.963
I wanted to ask about the

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:18.398
outreach programs are.

01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:21.201
Big supporter them and again I

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.236
guess are not called out

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:23.804
reaching more in state pap.

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:26.573
Like that I'm there are some

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.174
programs that receive special

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.975
being called saved up action --

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:32.412
Are to some of our transfer out

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:33.079
reach program so that they had a

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:38.385
big.

01:47:38.451 --> 01:47:38.985
Question is that. Twenty years

01:47:39.052 --> 01:47:42.355
ago student centered ones are

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.424
like that nay step.

01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:47.294
Your P. there than very very

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:47.961
well there's the school centered

01:47:48.028 --> 01:47:50.630
once and rats reforming.

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:52.632
The schools and Santa three are

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:54.501
in a press.

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:56.603
Whatever they interpreted the

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:56.870
pipeline.

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:59.139
That's a lot of work and a lot

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:00.574
of money in the students are

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:00.841
ones is.

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:02.843
A five students who are on the

01:48:02.909 --> 01:48:04.377
bubble.

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:10.317
Any get them closer so you get

01:48:10.383 --> 01:48:12.619
this is transform. Thousand

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:15.288
students but you could maybe

01:48:15.355 --> 01:48:16.356
hand pick itself.

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:18.391
Someone say that's kind of

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:18.992
creaming because you're just

01:48:19.059 --> 01:48:20.727
getting sick people who are just

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:24.464
about their what do you.

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:25.131
What do you think the worthiness

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:26.600
of of those and and what could

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:30.770
we do tend? To have especially

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:32.405
want.

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:36.376
To focused on you know.

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:37.043
Diverse city of our of our of

01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:38.879
our UC system in right and wrong

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:40.480
more African American and Latino

01:48:40.547 --> 01:48:42.515
students right.

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.351
I think it's a combination of

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:44.885
both you know you need a

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.419
combination of both we were

01:48:46.486 --> 01:48:48.188
frequently in our out reach

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:48.855
encountering phenomenal students

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:50.223
with phenomenal GPAs.

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:52.292
Of from we a first generation

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:52.959
families I had no idea that they

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.427
would even be competitive they

01:48:54.494 --> 01:48:56.329
you know you talk to them it's

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:56.963
like well I think I'll probably

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:58.732
just go to my local community

01:48:58.798 --> 01:48:58.999
college.

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.734
Which is not a bad option it's

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.702
an option I took as a first

01:49:02.769 --> 01:49:04.638
generation student.

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.806
But without fully realizing the

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:07.474
financial aid that was available

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:10.410
to me so the admissions office.

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:12.846
Meet thousands of those kinds of

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:16.349
stew about great has community

01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:16.983
college is an option but let's

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.885
get your application into you

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:20.587
see as well and and let's see if

01:49:20.654 --> 01:49:22.656
we can make that work for you at

01:49:22.722 --> 01:49:24.524
the same time I think our early

01:49:24.591 --> 01:49:26.426
out reach programs that are

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:26.660
funded.

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:28.361
Through the say pet funds --

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.664
Are essential to creating that

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.365
pipeline for the families that

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:34.334
just really have no background

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:36.670
knowledge of higher education a

01:49:36.736 --> 01:49:38.738
missile amount and I go way back

01:49:38.805 --> 01:49:40.707
working with the local program

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:42.642
in Santa Barbara called cal soap.

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:44.644
And you know cal soap is a

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.379
program that works with first

01:49:46.446 --> 01:49:48.548
generation families this state

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:48.782
funded.

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:52.285
And the immediate out reach

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.321
offices like mind in close

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.222
conjunction with those programs

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:56.856
so at the same time that we're

01:49:56.923 --> 01:49:58.558
doing Sir the large scale

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:00.593
blanket covering of the state of

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.495
California we also work very

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:06.733
closely with those say pet

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.668
programs.

01:50:08.735 --> 01:50:09.269
I think you need both yeah.

01:50:09.336 --> 01:50:12.439
Okay [inaudible]

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:14.374
Thank you.

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:16.476
I am curious --

01:50:16.543 --> 01:50:18.611
About the call a community

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:20.246
college promise program an

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:20.947
impact it's had on admissions or

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:22.349
maybe it hasn't had an impact --

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:24.617
On the community college side we

01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:26.786
have seen an and unbelievable

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:28.488
statewide enthusiasm for these

01:50:28.555 --> 01:50:30.523
promise programs a grain unity

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.824
college --

01:50:30.890 --> 01:50:32.692
And we're just trying to

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:34.527
identify is some of the

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.162
anecdotal information that we

01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:38.264
received it equivalent to what

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:38.932
you're all starting to see or is

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:40.467
it too early to tell --

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:42.235
Because it hasn't really been

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:44.237
adopted --

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:44.604
You know I'm.

01:50:44.671 --> 01:50:46.573
In a kind of a stronger way at

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:48.341
the statewide level starting

01:50:48.408 --> 01:50:50.543
certainly our community college

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:52.512
adversity college has adopted I

01:50:52.579 --> 01:50:53.146
just wonder if you can speak to

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.714
that.

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:56.416
Yeah I'm definitely starting to

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.718
see some of the results of that --

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:02.756
I think there are great options

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.557
for students I am starting to

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:08.762
see more still the first choice

01:51:08.828 --> 01:51:10.797
option as a result of those

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.699
problems programs.

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:16.436
I think that especially.

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.037
Yeah hi performing community

01:51:17.103 --> 01:51:18.671
colleges like Santa Barbara City

01:51:18.738 --> 01:51:20.673
College that also offers honors

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.575
programs.

01:51:22.642 --> 01:51:24.344
In conjunction with their

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:26.579
promise programs are very

01:51:26.646 --> 01:51:28.381
enticing families.

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:31.117
I can I ask you a question about

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:31.451
that comment.

01:51:31.518 --> 01:51:34.254
From your perspective is it

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.322
enticing tell all families or a

01:51:36.389 --> 01:51:38.391
are they are the combination of

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:40.326
promise and honors enticing to

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.228
families that --

01:51:42.295 --> 01:51:44.597
Or students that come from

01:51:44.664 --> 01:51:45.131
families who are not first

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:46.533
generation horn right I mean.

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:50.336
Right I think as the as you've

01:51:50.403 --> 01:51:50.670
mentioned --

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:52.739
This demand for you see there's

01:51:52.806 --> 01:51:56.342
a prestige that goes with you

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:58.178
see and families want that

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:58.812
prestige and there is a certain

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.380
set of families.

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.515
Usually the non of first

01:52:02.582 --> 01:52:04.517
generation those with college

01:52:04.584 --> 01:52:06.553
experience and their families

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:06.753
that.

01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:08.588
Typically we're not considering

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:12.292
the community colleges before --

01:52:12.358 --> 01:52:12.592
And wood.

01:52:12.659 --> 01:52:14.527
In our outreach efforts

01:52:14.594 --> 01:52:16.496
sometimes even be a bit offended

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:18.731
if we brought up a transfer

01:52:18.798 --> 01:52:20.266
option and I am now seeing.

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.669
Those families locally looking

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:28.241
at last of the again I also see

01:52:28.308 --> 01:52:30.443
that first generation family who

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:31.111
often things that's their only

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:32.645
option and again it's a great

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.948
option if they've done all the

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.449
research and determine that's

01:52:36.516 --> 01:52:38.384
the best that school for them.

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:40.420
I just too often see students

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:42.555
assume that the four year

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:44.491
universities are not an option

01:52:44.557 --> 01:52:46.526
and I I like to know courage

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:48.194
students to explore at all.

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:59.372
Thank you does that answer your

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.106
question it does yeah.

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:06.412
And and all for a view spoke at

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:06.646
the end.

01:53:06.713 --> 01:53:18.258
Of the and consistent funded and

01:53:18.324 --> 01:53:18.858
I higher at ninety eight the

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:19.492
community colleges benefit to

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:20.193
some extent of from prop ninety

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:20.793
eight but certainly not. For

01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.428
your schools so while we are

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:26.633
interested and I think recession

01:53:26.699 --> 01:53:28.268
through.

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:28.735
To the start of a real

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:29.035
[inaudible]

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.303
That's right.

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.472
I'm for higher and what is that

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:34.374
look like is in no viable is it

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:34.574
not.

01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:38.411
What other elements it?

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:39.045
Would you have us think about

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:40.647
that's not funding related in

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:41.247
terms of the legislature and

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:51.791
direction to support the student

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:52.425
from out reach to admissions to

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:54.194
enrollment to graduation.

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:54.494
And beyond.

01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:58.464
Besides funding [inaudible]

01:53:58.531 --> 01:54:00.567
Thanks Hyundai [inaudible]

01:54:00.633 --> 01:54:00.733
It.

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:04.304
And it's one we grab.

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:04.904
Well I would I would say yeah

01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:06.306
just.

01:54:06.372 --> 01:54:08.308
More conversations like this I

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:10.343
think are incredibly valuable

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:10.910
for instance the two to one

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.412
ratio I completely understand

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:13.046
that I'm a product like I said

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:13.680
of the community college and it

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:14.847
was a good start for me --

01:54:14.914 --> 01:54:16.716
But it also when were trying to

01:54:16.783 --> 01:54:18.551
get very creative with our

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:20.386
outreach efforts and we're

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:22.388
trying to reach as many students

01:54:22.455 --> 01:54:22.722
as possible.

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:26.392
Sometimes being bound to such a

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:30.396
restrictive policy with zero

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:32.365
wiggle room for instance that

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:34.367
two to one is is is an exact

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:34.601
count.

01:54:34.667 --> 01:54:36.703
Of the ratio we must maintain.

01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:38.671
And so sometimes like we were

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:42.342
all and so we are.

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.444
Doing all these special efforts

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:46.246
just to make sure we get those

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:48.281
last ten students enrolled.

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.250
That's taking up an enormous

01:54:50.316 --> 01:54:52.252
amount of time and resources so

01:54:52.318 --> 01:54:52.852
I would also say sometimes a

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.520
little bit more flexibility in

01:54:54.587 --> 01:54:56.489
understanding the challenges of

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:58.424
the work that we're doing --

01:54:58.491 --> 01:55:00.560
Would go a long way in allowing

01:55:00.627 --> 01:55:02.562
us to do really what we think is

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:06.332
best for the students.

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:06.966
I think one thing that I would

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:08.735
add is is just taking advantage

01:55:08.801 --> 01:55:10.637
of the programs that currently

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:11.137
exists so right now the

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:12.739
California student aid

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:14.474
commission will reach out.

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.409
To cal grant recipients letting

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:18.511
them know that they qualify for

01:55:18.578 --> 01:55:19.012
the conference program.

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:22.282
Couldn't we somehow have those

01:55:22.348 --> 01:55:24.317
instead of having students have

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:24.951
to to apply for the conference

01:55:25.018 --> 01:55:26.653
program just create a pipeline

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:28.454
and automatically connect them

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:30.890
with the resources on my bill

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:36.462
idea this between eighteen are.

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.264
Worth thinking about.

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:38.464
Yeah.

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:40.700
And I would can I just add one

01:55:40.767 --> 01:55:42.502
thing and at the goes back to

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:43.102
senator Jackson's question.

01:55:43.169 --> 01:55:44.737
I'm about how we measure things.

01:55:44.804 --> 01:55:45.405
On the kinds of metrics that you

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:46.839
all look for and think about

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:47.440
when we indicate what success

01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:48.608
looks like I think building on

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:50.443
leases response having

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:51.110
conversations about what success

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:52.612
looks like some what those

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:54.180
metrics look like together.

01:55:54.247 --> 01:55:54.681
Can really help us all

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.182
understand each other.

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:58.551
And bill programs that are more

01:55:58.618 --> 01:56:00.353
sustainable as well.

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:01.054
You know one of the things that

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.622
I think has been sort of

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:04.390
governor of brown's whole

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:08.361
approaches graduation --

01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:08.928
You once graduation numbers

01:56:08.995 --> 01:56:10.463
doesn't necessarily demonstrate

01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:12.799
that someone actually has gotten

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.334
a quality education.

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.536
The graduated --

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:17.203
There's got to be a happy medium

01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:18.838
somewhere in between where we

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:22.308
can judge the quality of that

01:56:22.375 --> 01:56:24.243
education as well as their

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.544
graduation.

01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:26.479
And maybe that's because here

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:28.448
with you --

01:56:28.514 --> 01:56:30.717
Because I still believe that the

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:32.552
goal of education is to teach

01:56:32.618 --> 01:56:34.687
people how to think critically.

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:36.689
Not necessarily just to get a

01:56:36.756 --> 01:56:38.424
job -- It

01:56:38.491 --> 01:56:40.460
and perhaps the answers again

01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:42.795
somewhere in the middle there --

01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:44.731
The notion you have to scramble

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:46.599
to meet your two to one ratio of

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.334
courses frustrating --

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.436
On the other hand what we see is

01:56:50.503 --> 01:56:52.605
a legislature is sometimes

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.640
people really start fudging the

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.376
numbers and taking advantage of

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.344
some of that flexibility so.

01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.413
Maybe that somewhere to where we

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:04.183
could find that happy medium.

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:04.851
As far as the graduation I don't

01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:06.486
want to diminish.

01:57:06.552 --> 01:57:08.187
What you said?

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:12.558
But in not much at that so much

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:13.226
at the UC but say really that's

01:57:13.292 --> 01:57:16.195
a CSU issue but still the UC if.

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.264
The more students who graduated

01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.433
at and I wanna go over this

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.570
three point nine years. For your

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:28.541
freshman and are. Nine three

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:29.208
nine four replace all that still

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:30.309
that's pretty remarkable and I

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:32.378
think it's lower than --

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:34.447
C. S. look most UC's and you

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.382
know now we have.

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:38.217
Students who get the Pell grant

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:40.386
in the summer is.

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:44.257
That that's just.

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:44.857
The graduate is for a pair of

01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:46.392
time.

01:57:46.459 --> 01:57:48.394
It's more access for other

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:50.296
students treat try to get in so --

01:57:50.363 --> 01:57:52.398
One thing that's kind of been

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:52.732
frustrating.

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:54.467
For many years this.

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:58.404
Is like someone saying earlier

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:00.273
that here in the summer.

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.308
Mister Haynes was saying that is

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:04.444
to say did campus and in the

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.312
have the buildings and it's

01:58:06.379 --> 01:58:08.414
everything's here so.

01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:12.518
How do we better utilize --

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:16.489
The facilities year round.

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:17.156
That's been that's been a topic

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:20.493
that's been going on for decades

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:22.361
yeah.

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:22.562
Well.

01:58:22.628 --> 01:58:24.497
I think it's changes it's

01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:25.131
changing and we actually have a

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.766
number of very innovative summer

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:27.333
programs about that how are

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.701
getting more students well our

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:30.703
office of our office of summer

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:31.137
sessions and is very

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:32.605
entrepreneurial actually has

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:33.206
worked in collaboration with

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:34.307
many of our other offices.

01:58:34.373 --> 01:58:36.275
Whatever continuing education is

01:58:36.342 --> 01:58:38.478
now called which I forgotten --

01:58:38.544 --> 01:58:39.111
They just change the name but

01:58:39.178 --> 01:58:40.780
they've got a number of really

01:58:40.847 --> 01:58:42.315
really innovative programs that

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:44.217
are joint programs --

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:44.784
In sort of academic slash

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:48.221
professional programs --

01:58:48.287 --> 01:58:50.323
Journalism a public advocacy is

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:50.990
one programs like that that are

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:52.692
going on in the summer we also

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.660
have a number very innovative --

01:58:54.727 --> 01:58:56.596
Bridge programs for students so

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:58.331
we have a freshman summer star

01:58:58.397 --> 01:59:00.166
program that runs in our seconds.

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:00.766
Second major summer sessions

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:02.902
about six weeks before the fall

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.170
quarter starts.

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:06.439
That's really really booming and

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:07.039
it's an excellent transition

01:59:07.106 --> 01:59:08.641
programs the data show that

01:59:08.708 --> 01:59:09.208
students who start in that

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:10.710
program especially under

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.278
represented students.

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:14.447
Really do remarkably well I'm

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:16.182
coming in the fall quarter I

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:16.782
mean all of our students where

01:59:16.849 --> 01:59:18.184
the American please I know that.

01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:18.718
Housing that a crunch and

01:59:18.784 --> 01:59:20.753
housing is empty housing is the

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.788
biggest for free right there

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.557
your I'm camps are doing stuff

01:59:24.624 --> 01:59:28.261
like that in --

01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:28.895
My soft ASEAN is also doing a

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.563
lot with online courses for

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:32.532
students who can't afford to

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:33.132
stay in the summer you go home

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:36.168
and work or family connections

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:36.769
so that our summers actually

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:38.604
doing a lot of online yeah.

01:59:38.671 --> 01:59:39.205
And Mike's office as a new

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:40.606
program to fought a support

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:42.708
students who to staying cam

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:43.376
thousand during the summer right

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:44.777
we we've been trying to expand --

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:46.612
Funding options for students to

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:47.280
be able to it the young not only

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:48.881
attend so if they attend full

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:50.349
time and they're they're taking

01:59:50.416 --> 01:59:50.983
at least twelve units will pay

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:52.585
450% of their housing on campus.

01:59:52.652 --> 01:59:54.420
So is that is that three point

01:59:54.487 --> 01:59:56.355
nine four because the students.

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:58.357
Start as a freshman taken a much

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:00.593
of course isn't that they

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.428
already have a semester done or

02:00:02.495 --> 02:00:12.238
is it because they're taking

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:14.507
more than fifteen person master.

02:00:14.574 --> 02:00:16.475
Yes summer summer yes a

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.411
combination.

02:00:18.477 --> 02:00:20.313
Of yeah.

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:22.248
A lot of the APA college level

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:22.815
courses summer courses the

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:24.417
freshmen summer start it's a

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:26.686
very very common now to see a

02:00:26.752 --> 02:00:27.019
student who.

02:00:27.086 --> 02:00:28.187
Enters as a freshman.

02:00:28.254 --> 02:00:30.256
Actually have enough units to be

02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:30.923
sophomores and even juniors were

02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:32.592
seen an increase in the number

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:33.225
of high school students have

02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:34.560
already completed their general

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:38.497
education course. For students

02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:40.433
are looking for ways to shave

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:42.335
off costs graduating early is

02:00:42.401 --> 02:00:44.203
one yeah definitely.

02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.870
Well I was thinking you know of

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.706
the to get that final credit

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:48.441
taking underwater basket weaving

02:00:48.507 --> 02:00:50.643
I mean that's yeah.

02:00:50.710 --> 02:00:52.511
That's not quite what we're

02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:54.280
trying to accomplish but no and

02:00:54.347 --> 02:00:54.880
actually I don't think that's

02:00:54.947 --> 02:00:56.248
what.

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.217
They're doing so much my date

02:00:58.284 --> 02:01:00.319
maybe so but no we're seen

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:00.753
students think very

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:02.555
strategically students are very

02:01:02.622 --> 02:01:04.757
outcome focus so regardless of

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:06.559
their major. For instance they

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:08.361
might be --

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:10.596
A science student who wants to

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:12.698
add a minor in professional

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:14.667
writing because they you know

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:15.267
think we'll and then and you

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:26.145
know how to write grant so I'm

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:28.648
going to add the minor in

02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:30.282
professional rite aid --

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.551
So students [inaudible]

02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:34.453
Well [inaudible]

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.188
State.

02:01:36.255 --> 02:01:38.591
You could say a fifty year

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:39.291
because fees were affordable now

02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:40.292
students are looking for ways.

02:01:40.359 --> 02:01:40.960
To graduate early or if they're

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:42.561
going to stay the four full

02:01:42.628 --> 02:01:44.196
years and maybe a quarter more.

02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:44.797
It needs to be because they're

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:46.599
supplementing their resume with --

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:48.267
A study abroad with a and

02:01:48.334 --> 02:01:48.934
experience will program that is

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:50.636
going to make them more

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:51.303
marketable and increasingly were

02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:52.738
creating programs that build in

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:54.240
that kind of experience for

02:01:54.306 --> 02:01:56.242
students even in that sort of

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:56.842
more traditional quote unquote

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.344
liberal arts education.

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:00.446
In my day students tried to stay

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:01.013
in school for five years to

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.348
avoid the draft.

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:04.283
I don't know if anybody

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:06.485
remembers anyone here was of

02:02:06.552 --> 02:02:08.554
that era but now students to

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:12.591
trying to graduate early moment

02:02:12.658 --> 02:02:14.260
their their viability in the

02:02:14.326 --> 02:02:16.395
workforce.

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:18.597
Strategic via an on that topic I

02:02:18.664 --> 02:02:20.332
actually want to follow up at

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:22.234
the center and I just came from

02:02:22.301 --> 02:02:24.503
a hearing related to natural

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:24.937
disaster response.

02:02:25.004 --> 02:02:28.240
And it's certainly --

02:02:28.307 --> 02:02:30.409
Very important issue --

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:32.378
At the state level and one of

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:33.045
the things that has come up has

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:34.280
been.

02:02:34.346 --> 02:02:36.382
What's the role of our research

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.150
institutions --

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:38.784
In helping us address I mean.

02:02:38.851 --> 02:02:42.221
Something that's so big that all

02:02:42.288 --> 02:02:42.621
the experts are.

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:44.590
Still struggling to figure out

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.258
what we do about the wild fires

02:02:46.325 --> 02:02:46.726
and as I hear these

02:02:46.792 --> 02:02:50.329
conversations about --

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:52.231
Students --

02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:54.300
Bean outcome driven I mean

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:54.934
certainly I worked here in the

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.769
term time to degree matter to

02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:58.304
last.

02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:00.306
I think about the senator's

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:02.308
comment related to we also want

02:03:02.374 --> 02:03:04.210
them to be critical thinkers --

02:03:04.276 --> 02:03:04.844
In in my case at I I have a

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.612
special place for undergraduate

02:03:06.679 --> 02:03:08.447
research on and research

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.516
altogether and wanting students

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:12.585
to yes get these degrees and get

02:03:12.651 --> 02:03:16.222
very practical --

02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:18.290
Skills that will help them

02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:20.526
certainly as we tackle monster

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:22.628
issues we need the critical

02:03:22.695 --> 02:03:26.132
thinkers we need the researchers

02:03:26.198 --> 02:03:28.367
to help us tackle problems that

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:28.534
are.

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:29.101
Bigger than us right now --

02:03:29.168 --> 02:03:32.238
Can you speak to some trends

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:34.240
that you're seen around --

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:34.874
Students I mean are they still

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.675
getting these experiences is

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:38.511
that an area where we are doing

02:03:38.577 --> 02:03:40.346
a good job of investing maybe

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:42.581
not doing as great of a job

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:44.416
investing because that is so key

02:03:44.483 --> 02:03:46.452
to the state of California.

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:48.654
Effect yes so we just are in the

02:03:48.721 --> 02:03:50.322
process of reviewing

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:50.890
undergraduate research and

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:52.424
creative activities grant so

02:03:52.491 --> 02:03:52.925
that's one of the major

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.426
undergraduate research programs

02:03:54.493 --> 02:03:55.027
in the college of letters and

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:56.495
science on our application

02:03:56.562 --> 02:03:58.430
numbers or up hugely this year

02:03:58.497 --> 02:04:02.368
like by. Twenty or 30% --

02:04:02.434 --> 02:04:03.068
And so that's are at the program

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:04.637
where students conduct

02:04:04.703 --> 02:04:05.271
independent research we also

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:06.739
have a program a sort of gateway

02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:08.374
programmer students work with

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:08.641
faculty.

02:04:08.707 --> 02:04:10.442
List research in a directory

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:12.645
also up twenty or 30% so we know

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:23.823
that undergraduates are keenly

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:24.390
interested in that research

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:26.358
experience and we know how

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:26.859
important that research

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:28.494
experience is as you.

02:04:28.561 --> 02:04:34.166
I'm for real.

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.268
Helping students to not just.

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:38.370
Around important issues.

02:04:38.437 --> 02:04:39.004
Yet undergraduate research has

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:42.474
always been a key feature of the

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:42.875
UCSB education --

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:44.577
My role as associate vice

02:04:44.643 --> 02:04:46.545
chancellor Frederick education

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.079
is sort of a new role in

02:04:47.146 --> 02:04:48.414
creating this office of

02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.416
undergraduate education but I

02:04:50.482 --> 02:04:52.251
the the to sort of keep things

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:52.918
that we're creating as capstone

02:04:52.985 --> 02:04:54.153
for students with undergraduate

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:54.687
research is an on campus

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:56.622
experience and then.

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:58.490
Study abroad is you know you see

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.492
SB use education abroad as

02:05:00.559 --> 02:05:02.494
always but I also queued spirit

02:05:02.561 --> 02:05:02.695
here.

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:04.630
But we're making maybe keep

02:05:04.697 --> 02:05:05.130
capstone experiences for

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:20.546
students

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.518
video if you look at

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:30.256
brochures you see edges in read.

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.424
Which is heavily.

02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:36.161
Mode probably the most request.

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.264
And at those reached.

02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:40.499
But the chancellor has let all

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:41.133
these years is what is it the

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:42.568
opportunities to get involved in

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:44.136
research we are seeing a lot

02:05:44.203 --> 02:05:44.737
more students coming to the

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:45.137
university from.

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.572
International Baccalaureate

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:48.774
programs I'd be programs where

02:05:48.841 --> 02:05:50.276
critical thinking.

02:05:50.342 --> 02:05:52.311
Is pushed dramatically in

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:52.945
students start getting research

02:05:53.012 --> 02:05:54.213
experience in high school and

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:54.747
they're looking for that

02:05:54.813 --> 02:05:55.381
experience when they get to the

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:56.548
university one of the things we

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:58.417
talk to students who have a lot

02:05:58.484 --> 02:05:58.984
of those Advanced Placement

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:00.853
units and I'd be on at some.

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:02.755
College credits before they come

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:04.723
is what that's going to allow

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.325
you to do is get involved in out

02:06:06.392 --> 02:06:08.460
reach lighten your schedule a

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.195
little bit to allow more time.

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:12.298
For those experience of programs

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:16.468
for outreach so our skis me for

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:16.802
research so.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.737
We start talking about research

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:20.506
the point that we are recruiting

02:06:20.572 --> 02:06:22.408
this student you'll see

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:23.008
information about the McNair

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:24.443
scholars programs in our email

02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:26.545
campaigns that we sent to

02:06:26.612 --> 02:06:26.812
students.

02:06:26.879 --> 02:06:28.948
We try to use McNair scholars

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.215
for instance --

02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:32.117
In our student profiles of

02:06:32.184 --> 02:06:32.418
success --

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:34.420
That we highlight and all of our

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:36.388
informational brochures we also

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.089
I just will add to have programs

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.424
that help students develop to

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:40.492
become undergraduate researchers

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:41.093
McNair is a kind of capstone

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:42.494
experience but those early

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:42.995
gateway programs are so

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:44.263
important.

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:44.930
Because they help students learn

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:48.233
to do that and faculty are very

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:48.867
very invest in those programs as

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:54.173
well.

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:58.444
Thank you 5% 55% yes yes 55% of

02:06:58.510 --> 02:07:02.348
undergrad actually.

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:04.483
56% of undergraduates.

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:06.185
You.

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:08.620
Thank you so much will now

02:07:08.687 --> 02:07:14.360
proceed with our our final panel.

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:16.362
Last but not least of course is

02:07:16.428 --> 02:07:18.330
our faculty and students.

02:07:18.397 --> 02:07:36.582
Perspective. Seven other

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:40.419
students go first [inaudible]

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:44.523
Okay -- Hi

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:46.325
there my name's modeling laden

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:48.293
occurs on a thank you --

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.295
For coming here to the campus

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:54.500
it's a lot easier that you're

02:07:54.566 --> 02:07:55.134
here rather than us tracking you

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.268
down.

02:07:56.335 --> 02:07:58.737
Yes but I am a thirty year

02:07:58.804 --> 02:08:00.439
history of public policy major

02:08:00.506 --> 02:08:02.374
at UCSB --

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:04.309
And I've had the opportunity to

02:08:04.376 --> 02:08:06.645
where thirty year and work where

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:14.720
you work and I came here --

02:08:14.787 --> 02:08:16.588
Nobody had a conversation with

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:18.590
me about what the UC's are

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.559
actually like and so when I came

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.561
here the reality was very

02:08:22.628 --> 02:08:23.228
different from what I was told

02:08:23.295 --> 02:08:24.463
about with you see could offer

02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:26.365
me -- I

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:28.600
found myself organizing for for

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:29.268
students that don't have housing

02:08:29.334 --> 02:08:30.836
they don't have food I'm trying

02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:32.738
to fight for it some funding for

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.506
sexual assault resources on our

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:36.208
campus --

02:08:36.275 --> 02:08:38.444
Issues that I didn't think we're

02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:40.212
going to be this prevalent in US

02:08:40.279 --> 02:08:42.448
state funded institution that I

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:42.981
grew up hearing that --

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:44.917
Was one of the best in the world.

02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:46.752
And so that was first very

02:08:46.819 --> 02:08:48.454
startling for me and then the

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.689
long that I went into it another

02:08:50.756 --> 02:08:51.356
interesting thing that I learned

02:08:51.423 --> 02:08:52.491
was disparities between the UC

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:54.293
campuses --

02:08:54.359 --> 02:08:54.893
That was a concept that never

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:56.728
had occurred to me before that

02:08:56.795 --> 02:08:58.797
there could be a campus like you

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:00.365
see more sad --

02:09:00.432 --> 02:09:14.813
Not like so many basic resources --

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.481
Compared so UC Berkeley that has

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:18.350
been here for a long time but

02:09:18.417 --> 02:09:20.385
the students both.

02:09:20.452 --> 02:09:22.488
Of you know.

02:09:22.554 --> 02:09:30.496
This is of our kids a six

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:30.896
infinitely plate.

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:34.266
So that was really --

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:34.500
Israel.

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:36.802
All the students protesting at

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:38.470
Berkeley and on our campuses

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:40.272
were actually trying to yell

02:09:40.339 --> 02:09:40.873
really loudly because people

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:42.374
work during that --

02:09:42.441 --> 02:09:43.008
And that they've been in the

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:44.309
situation for a long time and

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:44.943
that we've had a breaking point

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:45.244
where -- You

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:50.315
see students and and it's

02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:50.849
something that I'm really

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:51.250
passionate about.

02:09:51.316 --> 02:09:54.153
So something that I find you

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:56.421
need about the nineteen sixty

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:58.257
California hired master plan

02:09:58.323 --> 02:09:58.524
beyond --

02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:00.759
The creation of a really unique

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:04.263
higher public education system

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:04.830
is that how the authors and

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:08.267
legislators and higher education

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:08.567
leaders --

02:10:08.634 --> 02:10:08.800
And it.

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:10.669
Of a lot of pressure due to a

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.337
president population growth

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:14.439
still maintain the idea that

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.007
higher education needs to be

02:10:15.073 --> 02:10:16.275
affordable --

02:10:16.341 --> 02:10:16.975
And so I think that was a really

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:18.610
unique idea for the time and I

02:10:18.677 --> 02:10:20.279
think that there's a lot of

02:10:20.345 --> 02:10:20.946
parallels but we're experiencing

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:21.146
now.

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:24.216
And I understand that we have a

02:10:24.283 --> 02:10:24.850
huge population pressure on a

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:26.785
sound number in very different

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:28.220
circumstances.

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:28.887
But I also understand that the

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.656
situation where an especially

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:32.357
with increased funding in our

02:10:32.424 --> 02:10:34.259
state is a policy choice --

02:10:34.326 --> 02:10:34.860
And it's a policy choice that

02:10:34.927 --> 02:10:36.628
students aren't really going to

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:38.764
put up with anymore and I think

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:42.501
that's been very evident over

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:44.203
the past couple of years --

02:10:44.269 --> 02:10:48.207
And beyond that to the the

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:48.674
nineteen sixty eight I

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.375
California of higher education

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:50.576
plan.

02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:52.211
Really only pave the way for a

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.213
type of education Ford students

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:56.215
that our state actually saw

02:10:56.281 --> 02:10:56.848
getting higher education at the

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:57.049
time.

02:10:57.115 --> 02:10:58.684
That means we're still relying

02:10:58.750 --> 02:11:00.252
on a system that over

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:02.321
prioritizes white students can

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:02.654
be schools --

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:04.690
A system that was heralded for

02:11:04.756 --> 02:11:06.325
it's time and still today for

02:11:06.391 --> 02:11:08.393
the opportunities that it

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:08.827
created but Dodd.

02:11:08.894 --> 02:11:10.562
Disproportionately created on

02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:14.266
for five very small portion of

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:14.600
our state --

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:15.267
And it's still being represented

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:16.702
on every single one of our

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:18.370
campuses.

02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:20.439
So -- These

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:22.474
even very interesting cation

02:11:22.541 --> 02:11:24.443
works not just at the UC's but

02:11:24.509 --> 02:11:26.311
in California.

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:26.645
In general --

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:28.614
And seeing as this conversation

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.549
is more focus on you see SB

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:32.584
there are some issues that I

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:34.419
want to point out that idea and

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:35.053
I have experienced every time

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.655
here that I work with a lot of

02:11:36.722 --> 02:11:38.490
students about --

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:40.459
One of the issues that we have

02:11:40.525 --> 02:11:42.394
been made of aware of this year

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:44.429
is a lack of funding for

02:11:44.496 --> 02:11:45.030
undocumented student resources

02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:46.231
on a campus.

02:11:46.298 --> 02:11:48.367
So as I'm sure you're aware the

02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:49.001
C. office of the president --

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:50.602
Is not going to renew the

02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:52.437
funding sources that they're

02:11:52.504 --> 02:11:52.704
getting.

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.606
And study there having that job

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:56.575
done the chances to fundraise

02:11:56.642 --> 02:11:58.677
UCSB receives the least amount

02:11:58.744 --> 02:12:00.212
of money for are undocumented

02:12:00.279 --> 02:12:00.846
Ste bursting services and we

02:12:00.912 --> 02:12:02.681
also have the lowest amount.

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:06.385
And as I'm sure that's

02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:10.389
proportional --

02:12:10.455 --> 02:12:11.056
As I'm sure that's proportional

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:12.524
that's still not adequate we

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.158
should be and rolling a lot of

02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:14.593
undocumented students we should

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.294
be making sure that the students.

02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:16.428
Are not going to have to fight

02:12:16.495 --> 02:12:18.297
for resources from their chance

02:12:18.363 --> 02:12:18.964
are for funding but they should

02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:20.766
be like actually being taken

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:22.501
care by the state the state

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:24.469
needs to fight for all the

02:12:24.536 --> 02:12:25.170
students that our public system.

02:12:25.237 --> 02:12:26.738
Thankless undocumented students

02:12:26.805 --> 02:12:28.407
that also includes non resident

02:12:28.473 --> 02:12:30.442
students --

02:12:30.509 --> 02:12:34.313
As I read in this.

02:12:34.379 --> 02:12:36.348
In this agenda back up 16% --

02:12:36.415 --> 02:12:37.015
Of UCSB is population that's a

02:12:37.082 --> 02:12:38.617
huge portion and the students

02:12:38.684 --> 02:12:40.352
are carrying a huge load --

02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:42.387
On their shoulders to pay for

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:44.356
this institution that we

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:44.990
shouldn't necessarily have to

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:46.358
pay for it.

02:12:46.425 --> 02:12:47.025
And I tuition is making up such

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:48.360
a large portion.

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:50.562
Of of the California --

02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:54.399
Of the funding and a huge

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:56.601
percentage that is coming from

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:57.302
non resident students were being

02:12:57.369 --> 02:12:58.470
punished solely because they're

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:00.339
from a different state but

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:00.806
really really respect

02:13:00.872 --> 02:13:02.674
institution that they're going.

02:13:02.741 --> 02:13:04.242
To and that.

02:13:04.309 --> 02:13:06.378
As I know personally from a lot

02:13:06.445 --> 02:13:07.045
of my out of state students are

02:13:07.112 --> 02:13:08.647
really dedicated to staying in

02:13:08.714 --> 02:13:10.615
California and getting a job

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:12.384
here -- And

02:13:12.451 --> 02:13:13.018
working in these can be is that

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:14.386
we've all learned to love.

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.421
So beyond that there's issues

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:18.323
such as mental health services

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:20.492
are caps here only has five

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:22.227
concerts for sexual assault --

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:26.264
Survive use we also they as I

02:13:26.331 --> 02:13:26.865
recently got information from

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.667
that only plan to see if forty

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:30.669
people per day there now

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:31.269
currently sing seventy people

02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:32.404
per day --

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:34.773
There are a lot of instances in

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.408
the UC's when people have spoken

02:13:36.475 --> 02:13:38.543
to the concert and said this is

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:39.144
a dire emergency and they have

02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.612
been told to wait two weeks.

02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:42.280
I'm not to help dire emergency

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:42.814
is what it is that is an

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.349
emergency --

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:46.485
And we are at this institution

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:48.420
and the situations that were in

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:50.255
because of a lack of funding are

02:13:50.322 --> 02:13:52.290
contributing to increasing

02:13:52.357 --> 02:13:52.791
mental health issues.

02:13:52.858 --> 02:14:04.369
And that's a true that just

02:14:04.436 --> 02:14:05.036
needs to be spoken on it needs

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:08.306
to be addressed and a lot of

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:12.444
students I mean I mean I come in

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:14.346
incline [inaudible]

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:18.483
Missing -- I

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:19.050
think it's hard as a student

02:14:19.117 --> 02:14:19.351
[inaudible]

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:22.287
Just.

02:14:22.354 --> 02:14:26.158
And is not a true that were told

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:28.493
me calm and a lot of kids come

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:29.161
here and they face really severe

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:32.164
basic needs issues as well --

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:34.399
In this reality and and it's

02:14:34.466 --> 02:14:36.168
interesting having these

02:14:36.234 --> 02:14:36.835
conversations about how best to

02:14:36.902 --> 02:14:38.637
remediate the situation that

02:14:38.703 --> 02:14:39.004
were put in --

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:40.705
With people that have the

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:44.176
ability to change it so --

02:14:44.242 --> 02:14:44.810
I would just like to remind you

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:46.611
all that again this is a policy

02:14:46.678 --> 02:14:48.180
choice I understand there are a

02:14:48.246 --> 02:14:48.814
lot of different factors playing

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.549
into it and is a unique

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:52.517
relationship between the UC and

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:54.386
the state --

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:56.321
But as we saw last year through

02:14:56.388 --> 02:14:56.955
a lot of our students lobbying

02:14:57.022 --> 02:14:58.657
efforts and in the funding that

02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:00.459
we got from the state --

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:01.092
There's really who really an

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:04.229
important need to look past that

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:06.398
and address the real issue --

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:08.233
And really look at the students

02:15:08.300 --> 02:15:08.867
and like how we can benefit the

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:10.268
state.

02:15:10.335 --> 02:15:12.370
And also in a very humane level

02:15:12.437 --> 02:15:13.004
think about the situation that

02:15:13.071 --> 02:15:16.241
they're trying to live through

02:15:16.308 --> 02:15:18.443
just to receive an education.

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:24.282
Thank you thank you.

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:26.251
K. -- Good

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:26.885
afternoon Assemblymembers thank

02:15:26.952 --> 02:15:28.620
you for having me here.

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:30.755
My name is combine our state

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:32.390
which a cook when I'm of what

02:15:32.457 --> 02:15:34.493
their politicized major diverse

02:15:34.559 --> 02:15:36.361
a cop points out Barbara.

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:38.597
I'm also the vibration where you

02:15:38.663 --> 02:15:44.269
from it unless riverside versus

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:44.836
seven thousand is a kind of

02:15:44.903 --> 02:15:48.206
moved around a lot.

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.742
It's almost the bottom tropical

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:52.677
is for Betty C. which is to run

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:54.646
activists group here at base and

02:15:54.713 --> 02:15:56.214
hours campus.

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:58.183
Now less of the goals for but

02:15:58.250 --> 02:16:00.385
you see actually push for a bill

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:00.986
to extend the coverage summer

02:16:01.052 --> 02:16:02.621
maybe there are.

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:03.255
Fifty three now fortunately all

02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:04.322
bill failed.

02:16:04.389 --> 02:16:06.324
But in the process after

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.326
consulting là about to look at

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:08.960
some of the people involved in

02:16:09.027 --> 02:16:10.262
decided to bring it back.

02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:12.430
And so we reached out to use as

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:12.898
a it was a California

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.566
association would need a

02:16:14.633 --> 02:16:15.100
partnership with them.

02:16:15.166 --> 02:16:16.568
And of also reached out to the

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:24.376
constitution association percent

02:16:24.442 --> 02:16:24.576
212%.

02:16:24.643 --> 02:16:26.444
What that means is that per UC's

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:28.547
to that's a fifty thousand

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.448
dollar drop in thirty years?

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:30.982
See you do that's eleven

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:34.286
thousand dollar drop.

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:36.154
What hasn't up in the process is

02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:36.788
the need for college graduates?

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.823
And or the same public policy is

02:16:38.890 --> 02:16:40.292
to California would have a

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:40.959
college graduate of sort of one

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.360
point one billion but you're

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:42.694
twenty third.

02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.262
And that's all the more

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:44.896
conservative estimates I believe

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:48.600
this difficult to access has the

02:16:48.667 --> 02:16:50.302
number on two million.

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:52.637
Not in spite of this

02:16:52.704 --> 02:16:56.207
California's I'd give systems

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:56.841
are still not graduating enough

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:57.208
to is on time.

02:16:57.275 --> 02:17:00.412
So now in this process also door

02:17:00.478 --> 02:17:01.046
trivialize what the she's been

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:02.447
because we are very much aware

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.349
that the UC is leading a lot of

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:05.016
situations in graduate instance

02:17:05.083 --> 02:17:06.351
of color.

02:17:06.418 --> 02:17:06.918
And they should be commended

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:08.420
applauded for that.

02:17:08.486 --> 02:17:10.221
But even here at the you see if

02:17:10.288 --> 02:17:12.524
we compare pocket recipients to

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:13.158
non public recipients and use

02:17:13.224 --> 02:17:14.593
improper as a indication of

02:17:14.659 --> 02:17:16.628
income status we know they're

02:17:16.695 --> 02:17:18.563
not progress if it's a graduated

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:20.732
rate of 7% of for years.

02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:22.834
Whereas question Reyes and black

02:17:22.901 --> 02:17:24.402
and brown powder recipients are

02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:26.504
graduating rates below 50% of

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:32.410
the accidents about 40% for

02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:34.546
browsers around 46%.

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:36.948
And the reason I bring up these

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:38.350
where graduation rate is because

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:39.050
these institutions are market to

02:17:39.117 --> 02:17:40.885
us as for institutions so we're

02:17:40.952 --> 02:17:41.419
not to look at the six a

02:17:41.486 --> 02:17:42.654
graduation rates were injured in

02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:46.424
the for you because that's how

02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:46.958
it was sold to us will be

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.460
applied.

02:17:48.526 --> 02:17:50.295
Now this is the system we know

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:50.962
that the numbers even what does

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:52.397
Wall.

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.432
Whether the entices you that

02:17:54.499 --> 02:17:56.434
also universes of operation

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.068
there for you graduation rates

02:17:57.135 --> 02:17:58.370
aren't around 25%.

02:17:58.436 --> 02:18:04.476
Which is pretty sad.

02:18:04.542 --> 02:18:06.311
We will push for expanding

02:18:06.378 --> 02:18:08.213
access to financial aid because

02:18:08.279 --> 02:18:08.813
when a send up the a currently

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.682
people low income students we

02:18:10.749 --> 02:18:11.383
still don't have access based on

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:12.617
how the was the set up of

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:14.252
financial aid in California.

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:16.388
Will also push for legislation

02:18:16.454 --> 02:18:17.022
that understands that it's not

02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:18.690
enough just look at tuition fees

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:20.325
which need to look at the entire

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:20.892
total cost of attendance.

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.327
Because they've been such as

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:24.229
housing and text books that are

02:18:24.295 --> 02:18:26.431
making higher education a

02:18:26.498 --> 02:18:27.032
barmaid good based on income.

02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:28.733
Now do you governor legislator

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:30.335
what we're hoping is that.

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:32.971
He always damp us. For the sole

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:34.506
reason that we are definitely

02:18:34.572 --> 02:18:35.040
going to come back with

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:36.641
everything to bring these issues

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:38.643
up or pay to fight up until a

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:39.077
couple legislator.

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:40.745
Remembers that when you invest

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.247
in students invest in the future

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:44.416
California politically and

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.284
economically.

02:18:46.351 --> 02:18:48.486
Well the question to you all as

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.588
we all sat with us I hope you

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:52.624
have that is yes and I like to

02:18:52.691 --> 02:18:54.259
thank you for having

02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:54.559
[inaudible]

02:18:54.626 --> 02:18:56.428
Thank you --

02:18:56.494 --> 02:19:01.066
Good afternoon that term McCarty

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:01.700
and assemblymember the moment

Speak on the fact.

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:32.330
The of my colleagues --

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:32.997
Made a long term commitment to

02:19:33.064 --> 02:19:33.598
the campus the university and

02:19:33.665 --> 02:19:36.468
and the state of California. To

02:19:36.534 --> 02:19:37.102
start that pitted chime in with

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:40.505
the students and and and we're

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:42.674
proud to be probably the best

02:19:42.741 --> 02:19:44.743
public university system in in

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:46.745
the world based on the you know

02:19:46.811 --> 02:19:50.315
master plan and and the the

02:19:50.381 --> 02:19:52.417
build up of the and the system.

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:53.051
We have high standards on what

02:19:53.118 --> 02:19:54.819
we think what it takes to give

02:19:54.886 --> 02:19:56.554
students a first rate education

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:58.590
and we want to give students a

02:19:58.656 --> 02:20:02.494
first rate education.

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:04.195
In.

02:20:04.262 --> 02:20:06.264
Given that we're were greatly

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:06.765
disappointed by that the

02:20:06.831 --> 02:20:10.235
downward trend in state funding --

02:20:10.301 --> 02:20:12.537
You know when app in enough

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:13.204
relative and per capita relative

02:20:13.271 --> 02:20:14.639
to the state budget and whatever

02:20:14.706 --> 02:20:15.273
and measure you want to take.

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.674
You know looking back over the

02:20:16.741 --> 02:20:18.376
twenty five years that I've been

02:20:18.443 --> 02:20:20.545
here that we've gotten whacked --

02:20:20.612 --> 02:20:22.781
In every recession should be

02:20:22.847 --> 02:20:24.582
here gotten severe budget cuts

02:20:24.649 --> 02:20:26.451
and in every downturn we have

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:28.453
failed to get comparable budget

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.288
Gaines to reinstate the cuts

02:20:30.355 --> 02:20:32.557
that were there for me before.

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:33.191
And frankly I am a little bit

02:20:33.258 --> 02:20:34.659
afraid that we are keeping up

02:20:34.726 --> 02:20:36.528
with the trend as you expressed

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:38.429
concerns about a possible

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:40.431
recession come forward.

02:20:40.498 --> 02:20:41.099
We still have not recovered from

02:20:41.166 --> 02:20:42.801
the two thousand eight cuts

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:46.504
despite couple years of you know

02:20:46.571 --> 02:20:48.406
moderate --

02:20:48.473 --> 02:20:49.007
Funding increases but let me

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:52.143
focus on Santa Barbara and see

02:20:52.210 --> 02:20:58.283
few things about our campus --

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.716
Comment on that the

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.285
presentations made or Brough

02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.554
lords campus and in proud of it --

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:04.622
We're focused on giving students

02:21:04.689 --> 02:21:06.391
a top quality education and and

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:08.359
a broad range of disciplines in

02:21:08.426 --> 02:21:10.428
the humanities and the sciences

02:21:10.495 --> 02:21:10.829
and engineering.

02:21:10.895 --> 02:21:12.463
And we don't really have a lot

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.131
of professional schools the only

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:14.699
one we have is focused on the

02:21:14.766 --> 02:21:16.534
environment and that's I think

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:18.770
very telling it's it's a focus.

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.605
Of research across a lot of the

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:22.674
disciplines but that makes us

02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:24.475
more dependent on state support

02:21:24.542 --> 02:21:26.511
than many other campuses and so

02:21:26.578 --> 02:21:27.111
we're always hoping that our

02:21:27.178 --> 02:21:28.746
efforts are appreciated and in

02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:30.748
Sacramento and we're hoping for

02:21:30.815 --> 02:21:32.784
your support there.

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:34.752
And we also feel like we're

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:36.688
willing to the new campus and

02:21:36.754 --> 02:21:38.456
we're growing we're getting

02:21:38.523 --> 02:21:40.625
better so despite.

02:21:40.692 --> 02:21:42.727
You know all the obstacles at

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:44.796
our trajectory as is up and

02:21:44.863 --> 02:21:46.831
we're basically optimistic about

02:21:46.898 --> 02:21:48.399
our capabilities --

02:21:48.466 --> 02:21:50.835
If we get the at least decent

02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:53.037
funding on the research side --

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.606
Reputation is planning a

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:56.241
licensing the chancellor

02:21:56.307 --> 02:21:58.276
explained at some of that.

02:21:58.343 --> 02:22:00.311
Our research funding is now

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:02.480
almost equal to our entire state

02:22:02.547 --> 02:22:04.382
funding and that's that's at the

02:22:04.449 --> 02:22:04.849
British significant.

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:06.684
On the teaching side we're

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.453
becoming both more diverse and

02:22:08.519 --> 02:22:08.820
more selective.

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:16.261
I mean diversity and inclusion

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:20.198
are are obviously core values.

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:24.402
There's student email.

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:26.237
We're also doing own fundraiser

02:22:26.304 --> 02:22:28.439
in in the quarter areas of you

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:30.174
know funding for classrooms

02:22:30.241 --> 02:22:32.377
teaching labs --

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.345
Maintenance other core support

02:22:34.412 --> 02:22:36.481
that's that's a challenge for

02:22:36.547 --> 02:22:36.881
which we need --

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:40.251
Some support.

02:22:40.318 --> 02:22:40.885
Now that turned perhaps most

02:22:40.952 --> 02:22:42.620
important the purpose of this --

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:44.555
Hearing.

02:22:44.622 --> 02:22:46.457
We have pretty good relations

02:22:46.524 --> 02:22:47.025
between the faculty and the

02:22:47.091 --> 02:22:48.960
university administration and

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:50.495
you see in in general.

02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:52.397
Is known for the principle of

02:22:52.463 --> 02:22:54.532
shared gov and switch allows

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:55.099
faculty to work through the

02:22:55.166 --> 02:22:56.734
academic Senate to participate

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.536
in --

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:00.305
Universal decision making and

02:23:00.371 --> 02:23:00.972
I'm pleased to see that you're

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:02.373
UC Santa Barbara shared

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:04.709
governance is is working really

02:23:04.776 --> 02:23:05.043
well and I'm.

02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:06.544
Credit our chancellor for making

02:23:06.611 --> 02:23:10.248
a point of consulting faculty

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:12.183
and other campus groups.

02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:14.485
On on important issues and

02:23:14.552 --> 02:23:16.387
setting the right tone and as

02:23:16.454 --> 02:23:17.055
you know the chancellor has made

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:18.456
a long term commitment like many

02:23:18.523 --> 02:23:20.291
of the faculty to this.

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:20.858
Campus which is confidence

02:23:20.925 --> 02:23:24.262
inspiring in the shared

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:26.531
governance it to some of the

02:23:26.597 --> 02:23:28.232
needs me on to to comment on the

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:28.833
presentations by the by the

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:30.301
chancellor's.

02:23:30.368 --> 02:23:30.702
And nine others.

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:36.341
Most of what they said is really

02:23:36.407 --> 02:23:40.578
not news to read --

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:42.513
Pretty broadly with that and I'd

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:44.582
like to make that and be that

02:23:44.649 --> 02:23:46.451
understood as a as a you know

02:23:46.517 --> 02:23:58.363
endorsement off the the issues

02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.696
we've heard.

02:23:58.763 --> 02:24:00.832
The you know struggling with the

02:24:00.898 --> 02:24:02.734
rise and often a problem and

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:16.047
what --

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:16.314
Enormous.

02:24:16.381 --> 02:24:16.948
Certainly strongly supportive

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:17.615
off and capital projects and I I

02:24:17.682 --> 02:24:18.516
was delighted by your comments --

02:24:18.583 --> 02:24:20.618
Term McCarthy about a potential

02:24:20.685 --> 02:24:26.190
on the ship that would help us

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:28.326
greatly that came to friction

02:24:28.393 --> 02:24:28.626
[inaudible]

02:24:28.693 --> 02:24:32.330
For then at if you.

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:34.565
Faculty concern as granted

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:36.334
students faculty renewal and and

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:38.236
and quality control.

02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:40.405
Granted students specially PhD

02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:41.039
students are really central to

02:24:41.105 --> 02:24:41.506
research university.

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:44.375
And we're really troubled by the

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:45.043
slipping sheer graduate students

02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:46.677
at UC Santa Barbara when we

02:24:46.744 --> 02:24:48.813
formulated a long range academic

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.681
plan about fifteen years ago the

02:24:50.748 --> 02:24:52.383
act graduate student share was

02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:54.519
13% and the centerpiece of that

02:24:54.585 --> 02:24:56.554
plan was to raise that share

02:24:56.621 --> 02:24:58.289
270% to to a better job --

02:24:58.356 --> 02:25:00.825
In in that area instant the

02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:12.570
shares declined 211% and and

02:25:12.637 --> 02:25:13.137
that's really disturbing.

02:25:13.204 --> 02:25:13.738
It hurts so ability to teach

02:25:13.805 --> 02:25:14.338
undergraduates because the PhD

02:25:14.405 --> 02:25:14.872
student service key ace.

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:15.440
In hurt so intelligent to

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:16.107
previous research because to PhD

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:18.743
students are also that research

02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:22.547
is as it.

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:22.880
Should be --

02:25:22.947 --> 02:25:24.816
Because teaching advanced topics

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:28.186
are simply impossible blessed

02:25:28.252 --> 02:25:30.321
instructors on the edge of

02:25:30.388 --> 02:25:32.356
research in their respective

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:34.392
fields and the PhD students are

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:36.527
really at the center of that.

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.696
Second one of my medicine on

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:40.231
faculty renewal.

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:40.832
Many of our faculty here and

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.567
there in in their fifties and

02:25:42.633 --> 02:25:44.702
sixties and many of us love our

02:25:44.769 --> 02:25:46.571
job so much at least --

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:48.372
Stay way longer than its

02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:48.940
financially attractive but

02:25:49.006 --> 02:25:50.374
eventually people retire.

02:25:50.441 --> 02:25:52.210
And at that's a problem because

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:54.312
the university has really taken

02:25:54.378 --> 02:25:56.481
a systematic advantage off --

02:25:56.547 --> 02:25:58.516
Faculty members loyalty it's

02:25:58.583 --> 02:25:59.083
well known that long serving

02:25:59.150 --> 02:26:00.451
faculty --

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:02.520
Often except below market

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:04.255
salaries without immediately

02:26:04.322 --> 02:26:06.390
threatening to move.

02:26:06.457 --> 02:26:14.465
And think it's we sort of get

02:26:14.532 --> 02:26:15.032
used to buildings falling to

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:18.369
disappear com on this we pay in

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:20.571
equities credit [inaudible]

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:24.408
And the space for them to come

02:26:24.475 --> 02:26:26.577
and feel comfortable in into

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:28.312
space.

02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:28.613
So -- Units

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:30.515
because economist paying below

02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:32.383
market salaries in deferring

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:32.984
maintenance is a great short

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:34.619
term strategy for for saving

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.320
money.

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:36.821
But it's really not a

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:38.523
sustainable solution and we're

02:26:38.589 --> 02:26:40.424
concerned about faculty renewal

02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:42.393
and needing more attention.

02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:44.829
Going forward most one is better

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:45.329
quality control and and

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:46.898
specifically that the principle

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:48.366
of of peer review.

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:50.768
At this is worth emphasizing

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.904
giving this you know growth and

02:26:52.970 --> 02:26:54.705
reporting requirements fed beef

02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:58.242
experience over many years and I

02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.809
would have to say I have no

02:26:58.876 --> 02:27:00.411
problem with and accountability

02:27:00.478 --> 02:27:02.380
provided those to ask us for

02:27:02.446 --> 02:27:02.680
data also.

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:04.682
You know pay for the staff to

02:27:04.749 --> 02:27:06.651
provide all those data which is

02:27:06.717 --> 02:27:08.586
a source of growth and in in

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:10.254
staffing.

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:12.356
But the point one make is that

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:12.890
as far as I can tell the

02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:14.926
quantitative matrix really don't

02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:15.426
to the heart of how the

02:27:15.493 --> 02:27:18.229
university works. To keep

02:27:18.296 --> 02:27:20.531
principle years peer review when

02:27:20.598 --> 02:27:20.998
we produce research.

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.733
Is not recognized until

02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:24.769
validated by independent reviews

02:27:24.835 --> 02:27:26.737
and we apply the same principle

02:27:26.804 --> 02:27:28.239
to teaching it to the

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:30.541
organization of the universities

02:27:30.608 --> 02:27:31.042
for shared governance.

02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:32.476
In every course has course

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:34.545
evaluation each faculty member

02:27:34.612 --> 02:27:36.581
is revealed every at least every

02:27:36.647 --> 02:27:38.749
five years typically. Two and a

02:27:38.816 --> 02:27:40.818
two or three every department is

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:42.653
regularly reviewed by outside

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.622
experts that examine the quality

02:27:44.689 --> 02:27:46.524
instruction quality of research

02:27:46.591 --> 02:27:48.426
quality of the curriculum.

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:56.867
And those reviews look at

02:27:56.934 --> 02:27:58.903
metrics non commercial aspects

02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:00.738
of quality and so the the great

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:13.484
strength of peer review.

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:14.385
Is that combines measurement but

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:18.422
good judgment and the message

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:20.491
that I'm trying.

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:26.230
To say is that I messed. For

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:28.599
called guy.

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:30.468
Benchmarks Richard roles like

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:32.470
the two to one ratio for

02:28:32.536 --> 02:28:34.672
freshman transfers that burger

02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:36.173
ever mentioned.

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:38.709
And we believe we believe for a

02:28:38.776 --> 02:28:40.411
truck that we need sort of

02:28:40.478 --> 02:28:41.045
deserve some trust because we

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.280
have a fairly deeply.

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:42.947
Ingrained culture of peer review

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:44.382
and shared governance.

02:28:44.448 --> 02:28:46.484
And that provides a much more

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:48.286
rigorous quality control that

02:28:48.352 --> 02:28:50.755
anybody could and maple is found

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:54.792
that from challenges and and ask

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:56.327
for your support.

02:28:56.394 --> 02:28:58.929
All we really need is stable and

02:28:58.996 --> 02:29:00.531
reasonable funding level in a

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:02.700
measure of trust that lived

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:03.167
through such funding

02:29:03.234 --> 02:29:04.235
appropriately.

02:29:04.302 --> 02:29:06.370
And we will.

02:29:06.437 --> 02:29:10.241
Thank you enough.

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:12.343
Printer answer questions.

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:14.578
Thank you I have a few questions

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:16.580
and comments --

02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:18.282
Back -- In

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.816
the day is the state of

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:20.685
California I think put in fifty

02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:22.286
eight cents.

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:24.121
Of every dollar the university

02:29:24.188 --> 02:29:26.290
spent we're now down who is it

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:26.891
seventeen or eighteen sense.

02:29:26.957 --> 02:29:28.559
So we really have lost that

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:30.361
commitment the university

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:32.296
California used to be free --

02:29:32.363 --> 02:29:34.498
That was the commitment that

02:29:34.565 --> 02:29:36.434
anyone who could.

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.369
Qualify I would get a free

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:40.571
education because they do bring.

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:42.139
Your comments absolutely

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:42.406
accurate.

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:44.342
Most of the students who go to

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:46.577
university California want to

02:29:46.644 --> 02:29:48.245
stay here in California and most

02:29:48.312 --> 02:29:50.381
of are you see SB grads want to

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:51.048
stay here I mean they're smart.

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:54.218
Who I just came from Chicago in

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:54.785
a snowstorm who once lived

02:29:54.852 --> 02:29:56.487
through their life's too short?

02:29:56.554 --> 02:29:58.422
So -- Part

02:29:58.489 --> 02:30:02.526
of it is that we've lost sense.

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:04.195
But that being said.

02:30:04.261 --> 02:30:06.564
We are trying to identify our

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:08.566
our neediest students and

02:30:08.632 --> 02:30:10.534
provide as much funding as

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:12.503
possible and I do know I don't

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:14.505
know the exact numbers here you

02:30:14.572 --> 02:30:14.705
UCSB.

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:16.741
The number of students who get

02:30:16.807 --> 02:30:18.442
Pell grants and cal grant St god

02:30:18.509 --> 02:30:20.444
only knows what all there is but

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:22.680
when you work with students and

02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:24.248
and help them.

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:26.417
Most most of the students who

02:30:26.484 --> 02:30:28.252
needed don't pay tuition.

02:30:28.319 --> 02:30:30.187
But they do have to pay for

02:30:30.254 --> 02:30:32.256
living expenses so.

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:32.823
I'm not sure why where the

02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:34.592
university can come in and and

02:30:34.658 --> 02:30:36.260
I'm.

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:38.396
I'm trying to respond to your I

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.364
think very eloquent and and

02:30:40.431 --> 02:30:42.433
accurate concerns about.

02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:44.502
It getting education here how

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.437
how do we how do we do that on

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:48.439
eighteen cents to the dollar --

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:50.574
Versus fifty eight cents to the

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:52.309
dollar which we used to do I

02:30:52.376 --> 02:30:54.211
think it was back in the sixties --

02:30:54.278 --> 02:30:56.380
So.

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.382
The the you know funding I mean

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:00.418
there's a movement right now

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:02.453
frankly that I disapprove.

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:04.655
A intensely in privatizing all

02:31:04.722 --> 02:31:06.390
of education.

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:08.692
We're saying that University

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:10.661
Michigan comes to mind I think

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:11.228
that schools basically been

02:31:11.295 --> 02:31:12.263
privatized --

02:31:12.329 --> 02:31:14.432
I think it's a foolhardy effort

02:31:14.498 --> 02:31:14.732
and a bad.

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:16.767
One but we've done a little bit

02:31:16.834 --> 02:31:18.302
of that here in.

02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:20.404
In California so.

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:22.540
I I think one of the questions

02:31:22.606 --> 02:31:24.341
that I had --

02:31:24.408 --> 02:31:26.777
In this whole discussion and by

02:31:26.844 --> 02:31:27.445
the way I do want to agree with

02:31:27.511 --> 02:31:28.746
you mental health services are

02:31:28.813 --> 02:31:30.414
completely inadequate I put

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:32.249
money in our budget.

02:31:32.316 --> 02:31:34.418
As a member that the sub

02:31:34.485 --> 02:31:36.353
committee I think was a a twenty

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:36.987
five million dollars which would

02:31:37.054 --> 02:31:38.689
put money in for each of the

02:31:38.756 --> 02:31:40.858
UC's to start dealing with some

02:31:40.925 --> 02:31:42.526
of the mental health issues were

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:42.760
saying.

02:31:42.827 --> 02:31:44.261
With our students in the

02:31:44.328 --> 02:31:46.530
governor took it out we have new

02:31:46.597 --> 02:31:48.232
governor coming in he said

02:31:48.299 --> 02:31:48.866
higher education is a priority

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.701
of his and I'm hoping.

02:31:50.768 --> 02:31:54.505
This will be one of those --

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:54.839
Priorities --

02:31:54.905 --> 02:31:58.476
I do agree if we gray in the

02:31:58.542 --> 02:31:59.009
summer that was one of the

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:00.511
things I was told there the cost

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.713
of a of a unit is higher in the

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.348
summer.

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:06.450
No funding available who the

02:32:06.517 --> 02:32:07.051
heck's going to take advantage

02:32:07.117 --> 02:32:08.719
of but the that you made a

02:32:08.786 --> 02:32:10.354
statement that were over

02:32:10.421 --> 02:32:12.189
prioritizing white students.

02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:14.758
So I'd like you to clarify that

02:32:14.825 --> 02:32:15.426
a little bit for me particularly

02:32:15.493 --> 02:32:16.694
in light of the statements that

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.362
we heard here how we're doing

02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:20.464
out reach out we're getting a a

02:32:20.531 --> 02:32:22.333
pretty significant number of

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:22.666
underserved.

02:32:22.733 --> 02:32:24.635
Students 40% or the first my

02:32:24.702 --> 02:32:26.737
family to graduate nor making

02:32:26.804 --> 02:32:28.539
efforts but could you explain to

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:30.207
me what you.

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:44.188
What you mean by over

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:48.359
prioritizing white students

02:32:48.425 --> 02:32:48.659
[inaudible]

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:52.429
Yeah. To say is.

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:54.665
I'm thirty and I think it's

02:32:54.732 --> 02:32:54.899
white --

02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:56.267
Other.

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:56.800
But representative of what

02:32:56.867 --> 02:32:58.202
California is --

02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:58.769
And I think it's a simple as

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:00.437
that [inaudible]

02:33:00.504 --> 02:33:00.638
Well.

02:33:00.704 --> 02:33:02.306
Okay what percentage of

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:04.275
California it is white.

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.443
I have no idea I'm.

02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:07.111
Well the reason I ask is that I

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:08.612
think we are we are certainly a

02:33:08.679 --> 02:33:10.581
minority majority stake minority

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:11.015
up within quotes.

02:33:11.081 --> 02:33:12.816
So that the state is comprised

02:33:12.883 --> 02:33:14.318
more of a communities of color

02:33:14.385 --> 02:33:14.652
but I'm I'm.

02:33:14.718 --> 02:33:18.422
I'm not sure the 31% isn't over --

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:20.391
Reflection of the white

02:33:20.457 --> 02:33:24.461
population which is why I assets

02:33:24.528 --> 02:33:30.467
under -- I

02:33:30.534 --> 02:33:32.903
would think is we can talk about

02:33:32.970 --> 02:33:34.605
when we talk about hard has and

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:36.707
let's look at Lassen

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:38.676
specifically because eyes to all

02:33:38.742 --> 02:33:42.346
the service president PS you

02:33:42.413 --> 02:33:42.613
pleasure.

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:43.247
And all these which we saw as

02:33:43.314 --> 02:33:44.448
for the longest time our

02:33:44.515 --> 02:33:46.550
statistics were blaster

02:33:46.617 --> 02:33:48.485
publishers around what would

02:33:48.552 --> 02:33:50.621
hover between 2% 3% even though

02:33:50.688 --> 02:33:52.623
we know that and then the

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:54.425
technician whiner là yeah 30%

02:33:54.491 --> 02:33:58.462
by being up with there.

02:33:58.529 --> 02:33:58.963
And so we knew that --

02:33:59.029 --> 02:34:02.366
Pretty much and therefore in the

02:34:02.433 --> 02:34:02.967
state of California it's aye

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.668
these are five selections but

02:34:04.735 --> 02:34:06.637
even with the blasters who work

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:14.411
here.

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:15.012
There was a person of us was

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:16.714
there so I think the has been

02:34:16.780 --> 02:34:18.649
somewhat of a push to create

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:20.417
more programs to incorporate

02:34:20.484 --> 02:34:21.085
lessons but it will look at the

02:34:21.151 --> 02:34:22.586
service of what actual license

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:24.288
were saying here.

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:24.888
Some of those things are very

02:34:24.955 --> 02:34:26.490
does with the like I don't like

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:28.492
up in my county some things that

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:30.394
happen on my campus does.

02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:30.928
It make you feel like an

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:31.462
outsider there's a lot of

02:34:31.528 --> 02:34:32.329
stories about that and so is

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:34.331
efforts to like try and put --

02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:36.800
I noticed it was a trying to

02:34:36.867 --> 02:34:38.669
Lassen on missions right now

02:34:38.736 --> 02:34:39.303
what would be issue too great a

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:40.204
mentorship program.

02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:42.172
Which takes students were

02:34:42.239 --> 02:34:44.241
license here won't be here for

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:44.775
awhile and mentor them.

02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:46.510
And because part of the reason

02:34:46.577 --> 02:34:48.545
is that's when that program was

02:34:48.612 --> 02:34:49.213
created by blacks was actually

02:34:49.279 --> 02:34:50.814
because we saw that allows it to

02:34:50.881 --> 02:34:52.816
become if they don't have that

02:34:52.883 --> 02:34:53.350
connects to a community.

02:34:53.417 --> 02:34:54.385
And so this is.

02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:56.286
It is a bit of a problem it is

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:58.322
actually quite a major problem

02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.922
because this is a bet on one

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:00.824
situation where somebody said

02:35:00.891 --> 02:35:02.292
it's like their first I'm just

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:02.693
being from here.

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:04.595
And so having no sense of

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:05.229
community having those it's a

02:35:05.295 --> 02:35:06.563
connection to people look like

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.764
you.

02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:08.532
That becomes an entire problem

02:35:08.599 --> 02:35:10.601
and if your first and Reyes and

02:35:10.668 --> 02:35:11.235
you haven't been access these

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:14.371
resources I give a talk at the

02:35:14.438 --> 02:35:15.005
Mike action is the promise of

02:35:15.072 --> 02:35:15.339
our program.

02:35:15.406 --> 02:35:16.607
Bombs go program actually put a

02:35:16.674 --> 02:35:17.241
lot of black students two years

02:35:17.307 --> 02:35:18.342
ago -- The

02:35:18.409 --> 02:35:20.577
procession work with them over

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:20.811
summer.

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.246
And what it is which we noticed

02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:24.248
about the promise of our program

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:38.362
is that the reason why the big

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:40.798
you for a long time there was a

02:35:40.864 --> 02:35:42.666
blind spot in universities ought

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:44.435
not realizing that.

02:35:44.501 --> 02:35:46.336
These dessert institutional

02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:48.172
knowledge that by not being from

02:35:48.238 --> 02:35:48.772
that family which has led to

02:35:48.839 --> 02:35:50.808
some go to college actually

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:51.041
lackey.

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:52.176
At and I don't disagree with you

02:35:52.242 --> 02:35:52.710
I in fact I think you're

02:35:52.776 --> 02:36:03.387
absolutely correct and that's

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:04.354
been my understanding --

02:36:04.421 --> 02:36:06.557
Particularly with African

02:36:06.623 --> 02:36:08.325
American students on campus.

02:36:08.392 --> 02:36:10.227
The statement.

02:36:10.294 --> 02:36:12.229
Our ties.

02:36:12.296 --> 02:36:14.298
Students I'd like some.

02:36:14.364 --> 02:36:16.233
What that means?

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:16.633
I'm not getting.

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.702
The concept is cut and I agree

02:36:18.769 --> 02:36:20.337
that we have not been and one of

02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:20.904
things we try to do is wrap

02:36:20.971 --> 02:36:21.438
around services for first

02:36:21.505 --> 02:36:22.573
generation students --

02:36:22.639 --> 02:36:23.207
You know whose families don't

02:36:23.273 --> 02:36:24.675
have a history that they're not

02:36:24.742 --> 02:36:25.309
able to land the kind of support

02:36:25.375 --> 02:36:26.777
that's necessary I get that but

02:36:26.844 --> 02:36:28.345
how are we over prioritizing

02:36:28.412 --> 02:36:28.746
white students.

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:30.514
So in saying that it's not

02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:31.115
necessarily something that so

02:36:31.181 --> 02:36:32.282
over it --

02:36:32.349 --> 02:36:32.883
As I think it used to be and

02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:34.618
higher education systems whether

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:35.252
it's through admissions up and

02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:36.386
it's been a lot of efforts to

02:36:36.453 --> 02:36:36.987
remediate it but it's it's

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:38.122
evident through --

02:36:38.188 --> 02:36:40.290
A lack of funding for even on to

02:36:40.357 --> 02:36:40.624
resources --

02:36:40.691 --> 02:36:42.459
For things that a lot of

02:36:42.526 --> 02:36:44.628
students from white families are

02:36:44.695 --> 02:36:46.463
like what stands --

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:48.265
Hive economically like.

02:36:48.332 --> 02:36:48.899
Better situations instance of

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:50.601
color on a campus and the state

02:36:50.667 --> 02:36:52.503
and the universities and ability

02:36:52.569 --> 02:36:54.304
to acknowledge how that has a

02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:54.905
significant impact on their

02:36:54.972 --> 02:37:00.144
ability to succeed here --

02:37:00.210 --> 02:37:00.377
I think.

02:37:00.444 --> 02:37:04.314
Is we are trying to create

02:37:04.381 --> 02:37:04.982
opportunities for them to come.

02:37:05.048 --> 02:37:08.318
And so there are efforts --

02:37:08.385 --> 02:37:10.454
To encourage look that --

02:37:10.521 --> 02:37:12.356
Motions of color comes our

02:37:12.422 --> 02:37:12.990
campus and that they state their

02:37:13.056 --> 02:37:14.358
graduation --

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:16.426
I do think that it is a

02:37:16.493 --> 02:37:17.060
disservice to students of color

02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:18.629
that were not acting as fast as

02:37:18.695 --> 02:37:20.597
we should on that we're not

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:22.332
debate reading enough resources

02:37:22.399 --> 02:37:22.800
to these programs --

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:24.568
And it's beyond recruitment and

02:37:24.635 --> 02:37:26.503
retention it's down to basic

02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:28.505
needs programs it's down to the

02:37:28.572 --> 02:37:30.207
mental health programs it's down --

02:37:30.274 --> 02:37:32.342
To recruiting motions of color

02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:32.910
for our graduate school --

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:34.511
Stuff like that so while it's

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:36.346
not and maybe that covered that

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:38.315
state and I said can to receive

02:37:38.382 --> 02:37:40.250
be perceived as a little.

02:37:40.317 --> 02:37:42.519
Boy and I I do think that it is

02:37:42.586 --> 02:37:44.221
a situation that is that dire

02:37:44.288 --> 02:37:44.822
our public higher education

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:46.657
system should be a system in

02:37:46.723 --> 02:37:48.625
which we can help alleviate the

02:37:48.692 --> 02:37:50.527
disparities between people of

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.161
color and white people in the

02:37:51.228 --> 02:37:52.196
state of California --

02:37:52.262 --> 02:37:54.498
And I just think that it can do

02:37:54.565 --> 02:37:56.633
better and I wanted to do better.

02:37:56.700 --> 02:37:57.267
Than it already is and I think

02:37:57.334 --> 02:38:00.237
part of it starts before college

02:38:00.304 --> 02:38:02.372
coming Ted definitely so.

02:38:02.439 --> 02:38:02.940
So I appreciate that because

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:08.278
yeah.

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:08.912
I I hear what you're saying I'm

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:12.449
not not taking to consider what

02:38:12.516 --> 02:38:16.286
the injures in the new and who

02:38:16.353 --> 02:38:27.764
are first generation color who

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:32.169
haven't the same opportunities --

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:34.204
Because of family.

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:36.206
Comes sizzle.

02:38:36.273 --> 02:38:40.310
The general fund is associated.

02:38:40.377 --> 02:38:40.944
Education we don't need as much

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:42.212
okay.

02:38:42.279 --> 02:38:42.880
As we do perhaps in some of our

02:38:42.946 --> 02:38:44.615
from middle class white

02:38:44.681 --> 02:38:46.450
community site I get that I

02:38:46.516 --> 02:38:46.884
agree with that.

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:48.719
It's it justice to say were over

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:50.654
prioritizing white students I

02:38:50.721 --> 02:38:50.954
think is.

02:38:51.021 --> 02:38:52.656
It moves me sort of in a focus

02:38:52.723 --> 02:38:54.458
and I'm not sure I understand.

02:38:54.524 --> 02:38:55.025
Thank you and I think it's

02:38:55.092 --> 02:38:56.627
important to let me --

02:38:56.693 --> 02:38:58.395
Interjected appreciate back in

02:38:58.462 --> 02:38:58.962
the back and forth is if you

02:38:59.029 --> 02:39:02.332
look at higher and in general --

02:39:02.399 --> 02:39:02.933
Which but your point earlier

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.668
center Jackson's rise how much

02:39:04.735 --> 02:39:06.470
California used to invest in

02:39:06.536 --> 02:39:06.770
higher ed.

02:39:06.837 --> 02:39:09.072
That's when they California

02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:10.407
educate hired system UC and CSU.

02:39:10.474 --> 02:39:14.311
Was very very Caucasian and now

02:39:14.378 --> 02:39:18.415
an era I think this the FAA from

02:39:18.482 --> 02:39:22.552
the CSU system prospecting last

02:39:22.619 --> 02:39:26.290
year talk.

02:39:26.356 --> 02:39:28.492
The overall deal as the as the

02:39:28.558 --> 02:39:29.092
university system is getting

02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:32.296
more brown the state commitment

02:39:32.362 --> 02:39:34.197
to higher ed is going down.

02:39:34.264 --> 02:39:36.300
Trying to make a rhyme there but

02:39:36.366 --> 02:39:38.435
that that I think that is the is

02:39:38.502 --> 02:39:40.604
the picture that that we have to

02:39:40.671 --> 02:39:42.406
always realize is that in

02:39:42.472 --> 02:39:44.308
California at higher education

02:39:44.374 --> 02:39:44.608
funding --

02:39:44.675 --> 02:39:46.743
That's it that's reality but but

02:39:46.810 --> 02:39:48.345
back -- To I

02:39:48.412 --> 02:39:50.347
appreciate you letting that the

02:39:50.414 --> 02:39:52.482
student perspective.

02:39:52.549 --> 02:39:54.618
And I I do think it is important

02:39:54.685 --> 02:39:56.453
some of things that we're

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:56.853
grappling with.

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.255
Is is -- If

02:39:58.322 --> 02:40:02.359
we had to sit cases here of

02:40:02.426 --> 02:40:06.463
let's say a billion dollars.

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.697
Right.

02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:08.665
So for UC and CSU you could take

02:40:08.732 --> 02:40:10.600
that improperly fund.

02:40:10.667 --> 02:40:12.602
And I know UC's use you're

02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:14.638
asking for five hundred million

02:40:14.705 --> 02:40:18.308
of pieces for their budget and

02:40:18.375 --> 02:40:18.942
that's we should ask because we

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:20.410
need.

02:40:20.477 --> 02:40:22.512
But you can you can --

02:40:22.579 --> 02:40:24.381
Stop the UC system pay for

02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:26.483
compensation pay for deferred

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.984
maintenance the basic.

02:40:27.050 --> 02:40:30.153
Needs -- Do

02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:34.191
debt load housing hunger.

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:36.360
Food security the whole works

02:40:36.426 --> 02:40:38.161
and so you could have the other

02:40:38.228 --> 02:40:40.364
suit billion dollar suitcase.

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:42.599
And it reactive reinvested in

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:44.768
financial late which is what.

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:45.302
We've been trying to the

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:46.403
assembly last couple years

02:40:46.470 --> 02:40:48.271
basically --

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:48.939
Expand the cal grant give you an

02:40:49.006 --> 02:40:50.741
add on cal grant to not just you

02:40:50.807 --> 02:40:52.843
tuition but help pay for your

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:54.811
cost of living your Bucks

02:40:54.878 --> 02:40:56.713
transportation housing and so

02:40:56.780 --> 02:40:58.715
forth and you know that's that's

02:40:58.782 --> 02:41:00.717
our job that's what the budget

02:41:00.784 --> 02:41:01.151
subcommittee do is.

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:02.419
Grapple with these scarce

02:41:02.486 --> 02:41:04.788
resources that compete with

02:41:04.855 --> 02:41:06.456
health care and early education

02:41:06.523 --> 02:41:08.592
and child care and pre school

02:41:08.658 --> 02:41:10.727
and after school programs in the

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.763
works and and you know that's

02:41:12.829 --> 02:41:18.568
our problem but you your job is

02:41:18.635 --> 02:41:20.504

02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:22.339
appreciate you.

02:41:22.406 --> 02:41:24.574

know we're gonna get back out of

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:27.044
twenty nineteen and I think

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:28.378
there is.

02:41:28.445 --> 02:41:30.614
There's an opportunity we have

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:31.248
that at the new governor as as

02:41:31.314 --> 02:41:32.582
was mentioned to campaign

02:41:32.649 --> 02:41:34.451
heavily on higher education --

02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:46.696
We have a little bit of new --

02:41:46.763 --> 02:41:50.267
Increase revenue and in the

02:41:50.333 --> 02:41:50.901
twenty eighteen twenty nineteen

02:41:50.967 --> 02:41:54.471
budgets [inaudible]

02:41:54.538 --> 02:41:56.473
There is [inaudible]

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:58.408
Find.

02:41:58.475 --> 02:42:00.644
From you know early cation

02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:02.779
through K. twelve th hired

02:42:02.846 --> 02:42:04.448
because we're not you know.

02:42:04.514 --> 02:42:06.450
Funding what we need as far as

02:42:06.516 --> 02:42:08.318
the outcome you know.

02:42:08.385 --> 02:42:12.255
You'd be here --

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:14.357
You know what word just --

02:42:14.424 --> 02:42:15.025
Under achieving as far as as far

02:42:15.092 --> 02:42:16.293
as that --

02:42:16.359 --> 02:42:18.261
So I just want to thank you for

02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:20.197
sharing your perspective as far

02:42:20.263 --> 02:42:20.864
as the the fact that seven one I

02:42:20.931 --> 02:42:22.599
appreciate your respect as well

02:42:22.666 --> 02:42:23.233
just one comment it's it's a big

02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:24.234
interested.

02:42:24.301 --> 02:42:24.901
Of the legislature as far as the

02:42:24.968 --> 02:42:26.636
faculty in diverse you know you

02:42:26.703 --> 02:42:28.472
you mentioned that.

02:42:28.538 --> 02:42:32.576
We teach I could see.

02:42:32.642 --> 02:42:36.446
Baby boomers retiring and as we

02:42:36.513 --> 02:42:36.913
as a replace these --

02:42:36.980 --> 02:42:38.648
These positions it's really

02:42:38.715 --> 02:42:40.784
important that we we work hard

02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:42.586
to try to have people that

02:42:42.652 --> 02:42:46.356
reflect the students not just

02:42:46.423 --> 02:42:48.358
it's morally right but in a

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:48.992
research shows that students.

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:50.594
Do better when they have faculty

02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.329
members that reflect the

02:42:52.395 --> 02:42:52.696
community so.

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:56.633
That set a top priority of I

02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:00.403
know that is chairman Mr team

02:43:00.470 --> 02:43:01.037
this is one of his top higher

02:43:01.104 --> 02:43:02.639
and priorities and we've been

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:04.441
working on this for the last few

02:43:04.508 --> 02:43:04.674
years.

02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:06.443
Continue do so.

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:08.345
That is that's definitely a

02:43:08.411 --> 02:43:10.380
priority for us state that peak

02:43:10.447 --> 02:43:12.549
issue for us there is one the

02:43:12.616 --> 02:43:16.286
the size of the pipeline off --

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:16.953
You know graduate students PhD

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:18.555
students who are ready to take

02:43:18.622 --> 02:43:18.989
faculty positions.

02:43:19.055 --> 02:43:20.624
And the tremendous competition

02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:22.726
with with other distributions --

02:43:22.792 --> 02:43:25.028
And for the pipeline I'm getting

02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:26.329
back to graduate students if we

02:43:26.396 --> 02:43:28.532
you know fund --

02:43:28.598 --> 02:43:34.738
Graduate students PhD students

02:43:34.804 --> 02:43:38.775
that around the state UC has has

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:40.777
been the pipeline so the more

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:42.445
you know diverse students and

02:43:42.512 --> 02:43:44.414
graduate students weekend.

02:43:44.481 --> 02:43:46.483
The more be built the pipeline.

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:48.418
In of the faculty positions it's

02:43:48.485 --> 02:43:48.852
it's really tough.

02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:50.487
On my own department economics

02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:52.822
here --

02:43:52.889 --> 02:43:53.490
Actually benefitted from the you

02:43:53.557 --> 02:43:56.426
know state funding for faculty

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:56.860
diversity that --

02:43:56.927 --> 02:44:00.664
Was provided to us a year ago.

02:44:00.730 --> 02:44:02.599
We we competed for that for the

02:44:02.666 --> 02:44:04.834
first year we didn't get it and

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:05.435
do you think campus actually

02:44:05.502 --> 02:44:06.436
provided funds on their own

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:08.705
resources to support as a little

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.507
bit.

02:44:10.574 --> 02:44:11.041
And last year we got --

02:44:11.107 --> 02:44:14.277
Got funding add that that helped

02:44:14.344 --> 02:44:16.613
us we also hand and you know in

02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:18.615
don't cheer an awful cheers to

02:44:18.682 --> 02:44:20.317
one of those for for fundraising.

02:44:20.383 --> 02:44:20.584
At now --

02:44:20.650 --> 02:44:22.552
Experiences being we have

02:44:22.619 --> 02:44:24.654
scrounging around we have for

02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:32.562
look at all the further north

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:36.466
told year old enough every

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:38.335
single person and trying to see

02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:40.503
if that person must move all

02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:41.104
what it would take to move the

02:44:41.171 --> 02:44:41.438
person -- We

02:44:41.504 --> 02:44:43.139
did that three years ago scanned

02:44:43.206 --> 02:44:44.407
entire market --

02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:46.843
You know made made an offer I

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:50.213
think made to offers but all we

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:52.415
did was raise their salaries at

02:44:52.482 --> 02:44:53.083
their home institution recession

02:44:53.149 --> 02:44:54.718
as we're making an offer their

02:44:54.784 --> 02:44:56.486
family back and counter offer.

02:44:56.553 --> 02:44:58.655
That's the reality --

02:44:58.722 --> 02:44:59.289
Last year we were we were more

02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:00.323
successful --

02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:04.394
We got for the state funding we

02:45:04.461 --> 02:45:06.529
got -- One

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:08.398
M. Hispanic school young can

02:45:08.465 --> 02:45:10.233
attrition --

02:45:10.300 --> 02:45:10.533
Who got --

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.802
First of that apple stock for a

02:45:12.869 --> 02:45:16.473
year which expenses at his

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:16.840
tenure clock --

02:45:16.906 --> 02:45:18.808
Witness the state funding and

02:45:18.875 --> 02:45:20.577
then he's he's --

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:22.545
On board as a faculty member --

02:45:22.612 --> 02:45:24.414
Me also hired if it female

02:45:24.481 --> 02:45:26.216
faculty member --

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.318
That for that --

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:30.487
With with that supports and went

02:45:30.553 --> 02:45:38.895
all out and then in the process --

02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:42.866
In turn funds to get some seek

02:45:42.932 --> 02:45:44.567
funding for a center and that's

02:45:44.634 --> 02:45:46.670
the kind of support that it

02:45:46.736 --> 02:45:48.672
takes to hire minority faculty

02:45:48.738 --> 02:45:50.740
diversifying. Eight in the tree

02:45:50.807 --> 02:45:52.542
stream a competitive market yeah

02:45:52.609 --> 02:45:54.911
we had a three hour hearing on

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:56.646
this. Three weeks ago so --

02:45:56.713 --> 02:46:00.450
We we we we know it's it's that

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:02.519
it is complicated but was the

02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:04.254
one that.

02:46:04.321 --> 02:46:04.821
You know make it a priority

02:46:04.888 --> 02:46:06.756
summer we're we're clear

02:46:06.823 --> 02:46:12.362
committed to doing that we are

02:46:12.429 --> 02:46:14.164
fully committed to doing that.

02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:16.466
Thank you aye a pre shape the

02:46:16.533 --> 02:46:17.133
perspective they appreciate the

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:18.301
advocacy certainly I started as

02:46:18.368 --> 02:46:18.968
a student activists at the UC.

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:20.603
And my college friends don't

02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:21.137
understand how I ended up

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:21.771
working for the UC for eleven

02:46:21.838 --> 02:46:22.439
years -- The

02:46:22.505 --> 02:46:24.708
and that is so I appreciate the

02:46:24.774 --> 02:46:26.609
role and a think as chair

02:46:26.676 --> 02:46:28.545
McCarty said at Daddy's your

02:46:28.611 --> 02:46:30.480
role to be advocates in to be a

02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:32.248
vocal about --

02:46:32.315 --> 02:46:34.150
You know the issues and

02:46:34.217 --> 02:46:34.751
imperfections we see in the

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:34.984
system.

02:46:35.051 --> 02:46:38.254
There was a comment made around

02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:40.457
decrease if not a de funding and

02:46:40.523 --> 02:46:42.359
support to and documented

02:46:42.425 --> 02:46:44.260
students and I'm hoping that

02:46:44.327 --> 02:46:44.894
someone could please clarify.

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:50.233
What that means --

02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:52.369
And I don't.

02:46:52.435 --> 02:46:52.936
Is there a program that went

02:46:53.002 --> 02:46:54.404
away was that from cut coming

02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:54.938
from you see office of the

02:46:55.004 --> 02:46:56.339
president.

02:46:56.406 --> 02:46:58.475
I can provide and I don't think

02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.577
we can ask the the in the UC

02:47:00.643 --> 02:47:02.379
office the president that

02:47:02.445 --> 02:47:04.547
represented here maybe they can

02:47:04.614 --> 02:47:10.353
might not.

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:12.489
Thank you term McCarty say ever

02:47:12.555 --> 02:47:12.989
attended university of

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:13.523
California office of the

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:14.357
president --

02:47:14.424 --> 02:47:14.991
We currently have funding from

02:47:15.058 --> 02:47:16.292
documents student programs for

02:47:16.359 --> 02:47:18.495
eighteen nineteen that husband.

02:47:18.561 --> 02:47:20.363
That was set as a three year

02:47:20.430 --> 02:47:22.532
funding that ends in eighteen

02:47:22.599 --> 02:47:24.434
nineteen that has not yet been

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:26.336
extended because it's funded out

02:47:26.403 --> 02:47:26.636
of the UC --

02:47:26.703 --> 02:47:28.605
Piece budget.

02:47:28.671 --> 02:47:32.242
The region to any written up OP

02:47:32.308 --> 02:47:34.377
budget around may of twenty

02:47:34.444 --> 02:47:36.312
nineteen so this coming spring.

02:47:36.379 --> 02:47:38.381
Would be when the region's

02:47:38.448 --> 02:47:40.417
approved the potential

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:42.419
extensions but we haven't

02:47:42.485 --> 02:47:44.287
unfunded anything.

02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:44.821
It's just we haven't yet.

02:47:44.888 --> 02:47:48.658
Actively approved the next cycle

02:47:48.725 --> 02:47:50.393
of funding.

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.429
That's done by the region's that

02:47:52.495 --> 02:47:53.096
is done by the region discerning

02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:54.731
indication that that's going to

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:56.299
be a problem going forward.

02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:58.668
The regions are highly

02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:00.603
supportive of undocumented

02:48:00.670 --> 02:48:02.205
students okay services.

02:48:02.272 --> 02:48:04.707
Thank you for the flag it for

02:48:04.774 --> 02:48:06.643
and so on the record we support

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:08.311
that.

02:48:08.378 --> 02:48:10.513
And I know the regions that are

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.615
urging have have look to look at

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.484
other pots of money you see why

02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:16.219
to prioritize.

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.421
Statewide priorities and and

02:48:18.488 --> 02:48:20.557
this is one that we have with

02:48:20.623 --> 02:48:24.360
that.

02:48:24.427 --> 02:48:28.364
That talked about so.

02:48:28.431 --> 02:48:30.300
Okay thank you okay.

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:32.368
Thank you for that for the

02:48:32.435 --> 02:48:34.237
presentation I believe we we now

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:36.406
have the opportunity if anybody.

02:48:36.473 --> 02:48:37.040
In your three hours now but if

02:48:37.106 --> 02:48:38.341
anybody.

02:48:38.408 --> 02:48:38.875
Would like to speak --

02:48:38.942 --> 02:48:40.743
Is our public comment sections

02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:42.445
of there is anybody.

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.314
Please --

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:46.382
Plan F. right here.

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:48.751
I'm reading a prepared statement

02:48:48.818 --> 02:48:50.753
greater everybody my name's

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:51.387
Johnson good for those who don't

02:48:51.454 --> 02:48:52.255
know me.

02:48:52.322 --> 02:48:52.856
I service vice president the

02:48:52.922 --> 02:48:54.691
board of trustees for some of

02:48:54.757 --> 02:48:55.291
the City College but I'm here

02:48:55.358 --> 02:48:56.392
representing the re claim

02:48:56.459 --> 02:48:56.926
California hard to cation

02:48:56.993 --> 02:48:58.428
coalition which is.

02:48:58.495 --> 02:48:59.062
A coalition of unions fact two

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:00.597
groups and student groups across

02:49:00.663 --> 02:49:02.565
all three segments marvelous

02:49:02.632 --> 02:49:04.467
comments I think.

02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:06.503
Yeah I was a student leader they

02:49:06.569 --> 02:49:07.136
get better every year self at

02:49:07.203 --> 02:49:08.738
this their GPAs are rising but

02:49:08.805 --> 02:49:10.406
that because he's I think rising

02:49:10.473 --> 02:49:10.740
even more --

02:49:10.807 --> 02:49:12.876
So first I want to say thank you

02:49:12.942 --> 02:49:14.444
for hosting I think it's very

02:49:14.511 --> 02:49:16.412
interesting to do a deep dive on

02:49:16.479 --> 02:49:18.381
a campus specific instead of on

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:19.048
the system why because you know

02:49:19.115 --> 02:49:20.517
each campus is different --

02:49:20.583 --> 02:49:22.519
I want to thank you all for what

02:49:22.585 --> 02:49:23.086
you've done to find higher

02:49:23.152 --> 02:49:24.420
education the state of

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:26.322
California thing you know you

02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.890
three specifically have been

02:49:26.956 --> 02:49:28.358
very strong advocates.

02:49:28.424 --> 02:49:30.193
And yeah I think we all believe

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:30.393
that.

02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:32.395
A higher education is the single

02:49:32.462 --> 02:49:34.197
best social mobilize are

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:36.599
available to us as a society to

02:49:36.666 --> 02:49:38.668
move people up. Six years ago

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:40.303
the state fully funded the

02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:40.870
university and there was no

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:42.405
tuition.

02:49:42.472 --> 02:49:43.006
With only incidental fees.

02:49:43.072 --> 02:49:44.674
Today individual students and

02:49:44.741 --> 02:49:46.442
families are being given the

02:49:46.509 --> 02:49:47.043
responsibility of funding the

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:48.545
university rather than the

02:49:48.611 --> 02:49:50.580
public at large at UCSB were

02:49:50.647 --> 02:49:52.482
saying it's at a two to one

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:54.250
ratio the system wide COR funds

02:49:54.317 --> 02:49:56.352
are about almost.

02:49:56.419 --> 02:49:56.986
Fifty fifty coming from of the

02:49:57.053 --> 02:49:58.187
state or from tuition.

02:49:58.254 --> 02:50:00.423
On top of that.

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:00.957
They're paying more while

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:02.158
receiving less per student

02:50:02.225 --> 02:50:02.792
funding been compared to the

02:50:02.859 --> 02:50:04.727
year two thousand in the year.

02:50:04.794 --> 02:50:06.296
Nineteen eighty five while seats

02:50:06.362 --> 02:50:08.498
are you know being allocated to

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.266
tied to state students to help

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:10.767
make up for those budget

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:12.435
shortfalls.

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:14.637
Further this overall reduction

02:50:14.704 --> 02:50:16.506
state support happened gradually

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:18.341
ask camps did become less white

02:50:18.408 --> 02:50:20.476
and more diverse and as our

02:50:20.543 --> 02:50:21.044
prison populations grew and

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:22.645
funding was diverted in that

02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:24.380
direction.

02:50:24.447 --> 02:50:24.847
The result has been an

02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:28.651
unprecedented to because even if

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:30.253
you get a cal grant to pay for

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:30.887
your entire tuition which I did

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:32.822
not be tuition for four years.

02:50:32.889 --> 02:50:34.557
I still ended up with twenty

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:36.426
thousand dollars in debt because

02:50:36.492 --> 02:50:37.093
you need to pay for the cost of

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.394
living still.

02:50:38.461 --> 02:50:40.597
And it's difficult even measure

02:50:40.663 --> 02:50:42.432
how many people are self

02:50:42.498 --> 02:50:42.999
selected out of the system

02:50:43.066 --> 02:50:44.534
because they were data verse or

02:50:44.601 --> 02:50:46.536
that they were shocked by the

02:50:46.603 --> 02:50:48.271
sticker price as was mentioned --

02:50:48.338 --> 02:50:50.473
Even if you know your come from

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:52.408
alone can background I did.

02:50:52.475 --> 02:50:53.042
A lot of my friends in end up

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.677
going because it costs too much

02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:56.245
wasn't for them.

02:50:56.312 --> 02:50:58.214
It's often said that it's way

02:50:58.281 --> 02:50:58.781
too expensive to return to

02:50:58.848 --> 02:51:00.516
tuition free college or to

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:02.352
restore quality in person

02:51:02.418 --> 02:51:02.619
funding.

02:51:02.685 --> 02:51:04.654
Or to expand access in fully

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:06.389
fund each new student into the

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:08.358
university or to provide robust

02:51:08.424 --> 02:51:10.560
financial aid for cost of living

02:51:10.627 --> 02:51:12.595
expenses. To do them all would

02:51:12.662 --> 02:51:14.330
seem you know impossible.

02:51:14.397 --> 02:51:16.299
We are here to say that it will

02:51:16.366 --> 02:51:16.899
actually cost fifteen million

02:51:16.966 --> 02:51:18.501
dollars if you include the six

02:51:18.568 --> 02:51:20.503
billion required for pop ninety

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:21.170
eight you know fall new revenue.

02:51:21.237 --> 02:51:24.374
I which translates 250% of

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.509
taxpayers paying a tax of sixty

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:28.811
six dollars a year or less --

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:44.394
To find this. To fund this

02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:45.028
budget at that rate [inaudible]

02:51:45.094 --> 02:51:48.598
90%. One money send.

02:51:48.665 --> 02:51:52.368
The without.

02:51:52.435 --> 02:51:54.437
To restoring per student funding.

02:51:54.504 --> 02:51:55.071
Repurpose in financial aid to

02:51:55.138 --> 02:51:56.572
cover costs of living expenses.

02:51:56.639 --> 02:51:58.341
And to expand seats available.

02:51:58.408 --> 02:52:00.410
We're also looking at metrics to

02:52:00.476 --> 02:52:01.010
correspond with that such a

02:52:01.077 --> 02:52:02.478
large increase in public funding.

02:52:02.545 --> 02:52:04.414
But all could be done for a

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.282
relatively affordable price to

02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:08.284
the individual and a tax form of

02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:10.453
financing inside of a tuition

02:52:10.520 --> 02:52:12.555
former financing which you know

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:14.390
we we feel that tuition is in

02:52:14.457 --> 02:52:14.590
fact.

02:52:14.657 --> 02:52:15.224
A tax on those who choose to go

02:52:15.291 --> 02:52:18.261
to college.

02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:18.795
This would be a line the

02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:20.396
university back into becoming a

02:52:20.463 --> 02:52:22.465
true public good rather than

02:52:22.532 --> 02:52:24.300
individual endeavor.

02:52:24.367 --> 02:52:24.867
This would and this in depth

02:52:24.934 --> 02:52:26.803
that crisis along Badgett its

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:28.671
graduates all of them not just

02:52:28.738 --> 02:52:30.740
the rich ones to start their

02:52:30.807 --> 02:52:32.642
lives after college without that

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:34.310
because right now.

02:52:34.377 --> 02:52:36.345
Most of us graduate with that --

02:52:36.412 --> 02:52:36.979
And then we will be able to

02:52:37.046 --> 02:52:38.681
spend our money in the local

02:52:38.748 --> 02:52:40.483
economy instead of sending it to

02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:42.452
Pennsylvania which is where my

02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:43.052
three hundred dollars a month

02:52:43.119 --> 02:52:44.387
goes -- We

02:52:44.454 --> 02:52:46.355
went up and down the state the

02:52:46.422 --> 02:52:46.989
past two years as the coalition

02:52:47.056 --> 02:52:48.624
raising awareness building

02:52:48.691 --> 02:52:50.526
support and taking feedback on

02:52:50.593 --> 02:52:52.528
our idea and plan.

02:52:52.595 --> 02:52:54.197
And we have found resounding

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:54.464
support.

02:52:54.530 --> 02:52:58.668
From organizations of all kinds.

02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:00.870
We look for our coalition goal

02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:02.605
is to finalize the bill a place

02:53:02.672 --> 02:53:04.540
holder and first week of January

02:53:04.607 --> 02:53:06.309
for introduction in the next

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:06.576
session.

02:53:06.642 --> 02:53:08.344
That encompasses the tenants

02:53:08.411 --> 02:53:10.313
I've described we look forward

02:53:10.379 --> 02:53:10.947
to working with this committee

02:53:11.013 --> 02:53:12.782
the Senate and other partners in

02:53:12.849 --> 02:53:14.484
the coming months to reclaim the

02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:16.319
promise of the master plan.

02:53:16.385 --> 02:53:18.654
Set in nineteen sixty rate in in

02:53:18.721 --> 02:53:20.289
one year on a typewriter --

02:53:20.356 --> 02:53:20.923
For the twenty first century now

02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:22.258
moving forward.

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:22.959
We want to end by saying that in

02:53:23.025 --> 02:53:26.329
the last session the legislature

02:53:26.395 --> 02:53:26.729
and the governor.

02:53:26.796 --> 02:53:28.531
You know accumulated the votes

02:53:28.598 --> 02:53:30.166
and passed the gas tax.

02:53:30.233 --> 02:53:32.902
Like that to address a dire need

02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:35.071
that I I do support that and we

02:53:35.138 --> 02:53:35.471
do support that.

02:53:35.538 --> 02:53:38.241
Are we prepared to do the same

02:53:38.307 --> 02:53:38.808
for the dire need in higher

02:53:38.875 --> 02:53:39.242
education right now.

02:53:39.308 --> 02:53:40.343
Thank you [inaudible]

02:53:40.409 --> 02:53:44.413
Thank you.

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:46.415
Okay thing nobody else.

02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:46.649
That --

02:53:46.716 --> 02:53:47.250
Asking clues are hearing this
