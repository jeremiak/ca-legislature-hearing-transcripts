MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST ALL LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR HELPING TO WORK ON. THE BILL AS WELL AND WILL I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. HE'S ME AND JUST TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENT LANGUAGE. WE ADDRESSED IN THE LEGISLATION AND THE AMENDMENT WHICH IS THAT OF SPECIFICALLY THAT THE BOARD SHALL CONSIDER THE MATTER FOR THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA BOARD SHALL CONSIDER BOTH WHETHER THE LICENSEE DEPARTED FROM THE APPLICABLES STANDARD OF CARE AND WHETHER THAT MIS INFORMATION. OR JUST MEN FOR INFORMATION RESULTED IN HARM TO A PATIENT'S HEALTH. MEMBERS WE INTRODUCED ASSEMBLY BILL. TWENTY NINETY EIGHT SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE SEEING GLOBALLY AND THIS BILL DECLARES THE DISSEMINATION. OUR PROMOTION OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION OF THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO THE PUBLIC AS UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT UNDER THIS LAW THE CALC IS GIVE ME THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD WILL BE GIVEN THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO BRING. ACTION A- D. TODAY WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DR NICK SAWYER AS WELL AS DR TANYA SPIRITUS RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL% FORM WHICH MIGHT BE THIS AFTERNOON BUT I APPRECIATE THAT AND WHEN YOU'RE READY. MORNING MY NAME IS NICK SAWYER AND I'M EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND I PRACTICE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA BEEN PRACTICING EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER FOR TEN YEARS- WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF CORONAVIRUS HIT IN TWENTY TWENTY I VOLUNTEERED MY TIME AT ELMHURST HOSPITAL. WHICH WAS THE HARD HITS HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY AT THAT TIME. SOMETHING I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS DEVASTATING- TWO MONTHS LATER IN NEW YORK- IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY A GROUP OF PHYSICIANS CALLING THEMSELVES AMERICA'S FRONT LINE DOCTORS LED BY LICENSED CALIFORNIA POSITION NAME SIMONE GOLD. HOW THE PROS PRESS CONFERENCE. IN WHAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED THE MOST. A PROLIFIC PUBLIC SHOWING OF DISINFORMATION TO DATE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO RESPONSE BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. THERE IS NO RESPONSE BY THE MEDICAL BOARDS OR ANY ESTABLISHED INSTITUTION FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. AND YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE A NUMBER OF DOCTORS WILLING TO BETRAY THEIR OF POLITICIZE AND WEAPONIZE THEIR WHITE COATS FOR POLITICAL AND OR FINANCIAL GAIN. METASTASIZED THROUGHOUT OUR NATION. IS WELL COORDINATED AND WELL FUNDED NETWORK OF DOCTORS PROMOTED ANTI VACCINE CONSPIRACY THEORIES SO DISTRUST IN THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ULTIMATELY THE KOBE NINETEEN VACCINES. I SEE THESE IMPACTS AT MY WORK. HE AS AN EXAMPLE I SAW WOMEN IN THEIR SEVENTIES WITH MULTIPLE MEDICAL CONDITIONS HE WOULD SAY I GUESS IT COULD BE NINETEEN SHE REFUSED TO BELIEVE SHE HAD COVERED NINETEEN SHE SAID SHE HAD THE FLU. THEN SHE TOLD ME THAT IF SHE DID HAVE CODE NINETEEN I GAVE IT TO HER. AND THEN SHE SAID I GAVE IT TO HER BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF HER ILLNESS. SHE NEEDED TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BUT REFUSED IT. AND SHE LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HER. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. IS- A TRAGIC EVENT WITH A YOUNG MAN IN HIS TWENTIES WHO YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT HE HAD. AN UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITION IF YOU HAD SEEN HIM WALKING DOWN THE STREET. BUT THREE DAYS AFTER GETTING CO THAT HE CAME INTO MY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. GASPING FOR AIR WITH OXYGEN. OXYGENATION IN THE SIXTIES LOOK LIKE HE WAS DROWNING- THAT PATIENT DIED IN A MY KAHLER MY CARE THAT DAY. AND DISINFORMATION KILL HIM. IF HE WERE VACCINATED HE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ALIVE- THEY'RE OURS THERE'S TWO THINGS I REALLY WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT AT THAT YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THE SAY IN AND MAYBE MAKE MENTION THOSE TWO THINGS KIND OF QUICKLY YEAH I APOLOGIZE NO PERFECT- IS WE GOT TO STOP THE DISINFORMATION PIPELINE AND WHAT THAT IS THAT THESE ARE DOCTORS WHO ARE LICENSED PHYSICIAN TO CARRY THE SAME LICENSES I DO WHO PROVIDE LEGITIMACY TO DISINFORMATION WHICH NOW IN TWENTY NINE STATES STATE LEGISLATURES ARE USING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE DISINFORMATION BOARD HAS TAKEN ANY ACTION AGAINST LICENSE POSITIONS TO STOP THIS. THE SECOND THING WE NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT WE PASS AB TWENTY NINETY EIGHT BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD DOES ITS JOB BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PROVISIONS. ARE ALREADY ON THE BOOKS THAT THEY COULD BE USING TO DISCIPLINE THESE DOCTORS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON BERMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR TANYA SPIRITUS AND I'M A BOARD CERTIFIED OBSTETRICIAN GYNECOLOGIST. PRACTICING IN REDWOOD CITY CALIFORNIA I AM ALSO THE SPEAKER OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. HAS OF DELEGATES. AND PART OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND SEE MAYES BEHALF AS SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY NINETY EIGHT. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS UNFORTUNATELY LED TO INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION. RELATED TO THE DISEASE INCLUDING HOW THE VIRUS IS TRANSMITTED. PROMOTING UNTESTED TREATMENTS. AND CURES AND CALLING INTO QUESTION PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS SUCH AS MAX MASKING AND VACCINATIONS. MANY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING PHYSICIANS. HAVE BEEN CULPRITS OF THIS MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION EFFORT. RATHER PANDEMIC. MISINFORMATION AS PROLIFERATED WHEN IT COMES TO COVERT NINETEEN AND WOMEN'S HEALTH. ESPECIALLY SPECIFIC TO THE CODE NINETEEN VACCINES. AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY ITS PARTNERS AND ITS MEMBERS. HAVE WORKED HARD TO READ BUT DANGEROUS MYTHS SUCH AS THE LIGHT THAT THE- NINETEEN BUT CONSPIRACY THAT THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINES CAN SHED TO UNVACCINATED PEOPLE. IMPACTING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. THIS MISINFORMATION IS COMPROMISED OUR PATIENTS HEALTH. BY DISCOURAGING MANY OF THEM FROM RECEIVING LIFE SAVING VACCINES. MISINFORMATION MAY HAVE ALSO BECAUSE. WE SAW DURING THE PEAK COLOR AND WITH NEARLY ALL RECENT DEATHS COVERT NINETEEN OCCURRING AMONG UNVACCINATED PEOPLE THIS HEALTH INFORMATION HAS COST LIVES. CMA SUPPORTS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OF PROVIDING A CLEAR STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA TO PURSUE. DISCIPLINE AGAINST PHYSICIANS WHO FLAGRANTLY DISREGARD THEIR ETHICAL PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THEIR PATIENTS WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON BILL LANGUAGE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE BUT CMA WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW. TO ENSURE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO DISCIPLINE LICENSEES WHO VIOLATE THAT PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL DUTIES AS PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR AN EXTRA TO GO TO THE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE LAURA POWELL AND DR TRACY BETH HOGUE- IN PERSON TODAY. GOOD MORNING MORNING I'M MORE A PAL CALIFORNIANS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE IS A NONPARTISAN GROUP BUT SPEAKING PERSONALLY AS A LIFELONG DEMOCRAT AND A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY I AM DISMAYED THE DEMOCRATS ARE BRINGING FORWARD BILLS THAT UNDERMINE CIVIL LIBERTIES HI I APPRECIATE THAT THE CAN RECOGNIZE THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROBLEM PRESENTED BY THIS BILL. BUT TWEAKING THE LANGUAGE CANNOT REMEDY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S BAKED INTO THE DNA OF THE BILL. THE PURPOSE IS TO RESTRICT SPEECH BASED ON ITS CONTENTS. OUR CONSTITUTION SIMPLY DOESN'T ALLOW THAT BROAD INFRINGEMENT ON SPEECH EVEN IF THE SPEECH IS FALSE AND EVEN IF THE INTENT OF THE LAW IS COMPELLING. THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY WOULD DEPEND ON HOW IT IS ENFORCED. BUT THE MERE POTENTIAL THAT IT COULD BE APPLIED IN A WAY THE CHILLS SPEECH RENDERS IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE BEFORE IT'S EVEN ENFORCED. THIS BILL CAN'T BE SALVAGED BECAUSE ONCE YOU STRIP AWAY EVERY UNCONSTITUTIONAL ELEMENT WHAT YOU WOULD BE LEFT WITH. WOULD DUPLICATE EXISTING MALL. SO WHAT WITH THE BILL ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH. IT WOULD DISCOURAGE CONSCIENTIOUS DOCTORS FROM EXPRESSING THEMSELVES FREELY ABOUT A TOPIC. THAT IS FRAUGHT WITH UNCERTAINTY DUE TO ITS NOVELTY. QUOTING THE U. S. SUPREME COURT. REGULATING THE CONTENT OF PROFESSIONALS SPEECH POSES THE INHERENT RISK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS NOT TO ADVANCE A LEGITIMATE REGULATORY GOAL BUT TO SUPPRESS UNPOPULAR IDEAS OR INFORMATION DOCTORS HELP PATIENTS MAKE DEEPLY PERSONAL DECISIONS AND THEIR CANDOR IS CRUCIAL. THE REMEDY FOR SPEECH THAT IS FALSE IS SPEECH THAT IS TRUE THIS IS THE ORDINARY COURSE IN A FREE SOCIETY SO WITH THOSE PRINCIPLES IN MIND I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS TRACY BOB HOAG I AM A PRACTICING MD WITH A PHD IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND EPIDEMIOLOGY I COMPLETED MY RESIDENCY UC DAVIS I AM A MOTHER OF FOUR AND A DANISH AND CAN DOUBLE CITIZEN. IN MY WORK ABERDEEN BUT JUST THE COVERED PANDEMIC I PUBLISHED MOLD PEER START PUTTING ONE THE CDP AND AFTER BEFORE CAUGHT US ON OUR- RESPONSE. I A FULL OPPOSED THE TWENTY EIGHT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WILL HELP US PUNISHMENT THIS. FOR THE CORRECT I INTO THE CONSENT. THE POOR CONSIDER THE ANSWER IS A MATTER IN ONLY ANSWERS BY JUST JIM ORTHODOX. THIS IS A VERY ESSENCE THE SITE PROCESS. IN THE VISIT AXP IN A- TOP. SENSE EACH. PLEASE ENTER THERE HAVE BEEN MANY. DURING THE PAST OF THE- MISTER SHOULDN'T VENTURE EXCEPT MOSTLY. SPREAD BUT NOW NOTICE. ARAB FOR LONG BECAUSE OF AND SPACE HAVE SHOWN TO BE HONEST. TOLD THAT MASS. LIABILITY TRANSMISSION WE NOW KNOW THEY ARE ON REAL DOING THIS SINCE STILL DO I MASKING JANTSCH BETWEEN WHL NCDC ONE USING TO ANYONE USING SIX IS A CUT OFF WHICH ONE IS MISINFORMATION. THE BILL ALSO STATES ON BACK QUOTE UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS ARE AT RISK ARE AT RISK OF DYING FROM COVE IN NINETEEN THAT IS ELEVEN TIMES GREATER THAN THOSE WHO ARE FULLY VACCINATED. BUT THIS- BUT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC NOT TO FOR. HEALTH CONDITION IN THE STUDY IT WAS NOT A RANDOMIZED STUDY AND THREE PHYSICIANS LOOK AT THAT I KNOW CANNOT APPLY EQUALLY TO EVERY PATIENT SUCH AS THOSE WITH SEVERE IMMUNE COMPROMISED OR THE WITH A HISTORY OF IT OF IN. IRONICALLY A PROBE APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATELY EXPRESSING UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THIS STUDY MAY BE SEEN AS MISINFORMATION. I URGE YOU ALL TO HUMBLY COLLEGE SCIENCE IS FILLED WITH UNCERTAINTY AND CONSENSUS CAN CHANGE. WITH NEW INFORMATION. INCENTIVES BECAUSE- ARE ABLE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY AB TWENTY NINETY EIGHT MAY ROB. OF THIS CRIPPLE FREEDOM ROADING TRUST IN MEDICINE AND SLOWING VERY IN OUR MOVE TO.

MY NAME IS DANIEL FROM FRESNO AND I REPRESENT LIKE GETTING THOUSANDS OF LIKES LATINOS AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME FOR AB TWENTY NINETY EIGHT OKAY WILL BRING BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ANY YES DOCTOR WEBER. GOOD MORNING- SO THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE GROWING AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION- THAT WE SEE NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT JUST ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'M DUE TO COLD ED. AND YOU KNOW THIS WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP INITIALLY BY THE FEDERAL FEDERATION OF STATE AND MEDICAL BOARDS- BECAUSE THEY SAW. A HUGE UPTICK IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT THEY GOT FROM PATIENTS I'M ABOUT THE PHYSICIANS THAT WERE LICENSED UNDER THEM FOR DISTRIBUTING FALL HOLDING CERTAIN INFORMATION. AND I ALSO WANT TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THOSE THAT ARE HERE AND THOSE THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BE COMING. ON THAT AT THE END OF LAST SESSION WE PASSED HR SEVENTY FOUR. AND IN THAT WE DECLARED HEALTH MISINFORMATION A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND WE COMMITTED TO APPROPRIATELY COMBATING. HEALTH MISINFORMATION AND CURBING THE SPREAD OF FALSE SAID THAT THREATEN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS. AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AS A LICENSED PHYSICIAN WE POSSESS A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLIC TRUST. AND WE ALSO HAVE AN ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DO NO HARM AND TO SHARE INFORMATION THAT IS FACTUAL AND SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED. PURPOSELY SPREADING INACCURATE INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THAT RESPONSIBILITY ERODES PUBLIC TRUST AND PUTS PATIENTS AT RISK. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL AND THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT WHETHER YOU ARE HERE IN THE ROOM OR WATCHING OR LISTENING. PLEASE DO. PLEASE READ IT. I WANT TO THANK MY MEDICAL COLLEAGUES FOR BEING HERE AND ALSO FOR TELLING YOU KNOW THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT DISINFORMATION ON HEALTH FROM THE GROUND LEVEL. WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND AGAIN IF YOU READ IT YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT CLEARLY DEFINES WHAT MISINFORMATION IS. WHAT DIFFERENT WHAT THIS INFORMATION IS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO DISSEMINATE. IT ALSO SPECIFIES WHAT MUST BE CONSIDERED PRIOR TO BRINGING DISCIPLINARY ACTION. AND I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MENTIONED IT BUT I'M JUST GOING TO READ IT AGAIN. PRIOR TO BRINGING A DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST A LICENSEE UNDER THIS SECTION. THE BOARD SHALL CONSIDER BOTH WHETHER THE LICENSEE DEPARTED FROM THE APPLE CALL STANDARD OF CARE AND WHETHER THE MISINFORMATION OR DISINFORMATION RESULTED IN HARM TO A PATIENT. THIS ANALYSIS ALSO ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH I GOT A LOT OF EMAILS ABOUT THAT. THIS HAS BEEN DEBATED AND DECIDED BOTH OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND THE SUPREME COURT. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND PROFESSIONAL CONTACT. AND STATES MAY REGULATE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT EVEN THOUGH THAT CONTENT TO MAKE INCIDENTLY INVOLVED SPEECH. WE POSITIONS WE ARE PEOPLE TO. WE HAVE OUR OWN LIVES WE HAVE OUR INDIVIDUAL BELIEFS AND WE CAN FREELY SPEAK THOSE BELIEFS IN PUBLIC. BUT WHEN THAT SPREADS INTO OUR PRACTICE WHICH LEADS TO DIRECT HARM OF PATIENTS. THAT IS NOT OKAY. SO I MIGHT BELIEVE THAT HYPERTENSION IS NOT A REAL MEDICAL CONDITION ABOUT IT AT CONFERENCES. BUT IF YOU COME TO ME AND YOU HAVE A BLOOD PRESSURE OF TWO HUNDRED OVER ONE FIFTY. AND I SAY TO YOU YOU'RE FINE. NO WORK UP IS NEEDED. YOU DON'T NEED ANY MEDICATIONS GO HOME. I HAVE GIVEN YOU MISINFORMATION MY PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IS NOW A QUESTION AND I AM LIABLE FOR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. SO MANY THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY PROTECTS OUR PUBLIC. TAX THE TRUST THAT SOCIETY HAS PUT IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SEEING ANY MISTER LOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. NO THAT'S I APOLOGIZE THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE PROCESS WE HAVE. PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES WANT TO REAFFIRM THE DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THE STAFF AND THE PUBLIC PROCESS WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING HERE TODAY IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION PERRANCE SIMPLE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO PHYSICALLY CANNOT EVEN BE HERE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC TESTIMONY WE HAVE A PORTAL OPENED FOR WRITTEN TESTIMONY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO COME HERE IN PERSON AND THEN TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT I RESPECT AND APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WILLING TO COME AND PROVIDE THEIR INPUT. THIS IS THE STATE OF PROCESS AS WE KNOW THAT THE THERE ARE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH THIS IS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE DELIBERATIVE BODY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. DIVIDE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS THAT OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD. THE BILL IN FRONT OF US AGAIN FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO BEST BE AWARE. IS VERY. DIRECT WHICH IS AGAIN NUMBER ONE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THE KNOWN AND SUPPORTED STANDARDS OF CARE AND MAINTAINING THAT INTEGRITY I HAVE THERE IS A DEPARTURE OF THE STANDARD OF CARE. AS WELL AS IN IT. HARM TO A PATIENT THAT DOES QUALIFY. AS MISCONDUCT AND SPECIFICALLY THE DISSEMINATION IS DEFINED AS GROSS NEGLIGENCE THE DEFINITION OF MISINFORMATION IS MALICIOUS INTENT IT IS VERY SPECIFIC VERY DIRECT. IMPORTANT THAT WE HELP A LOT CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD TO HAVE THESE DEFINITIONS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE LIVES THAT'S WHAT HIS LEGISLATION IS ABOUT. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR VOTE BY VOTE WHEN THE PROPER TIME PROVIDES ITSELF THANK YOU MR LOW IN LET ME BEGIN BY THINKING THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO VOICE THEIR OPINIONS. ON THIS BILL TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND LET ME APOLOGIZE FOR CUSSING EARLIER I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT. FOR ANYONE WHO DID NOT GET THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TODAY. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUBMIT A COMMENT THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE WEBSITE WE RECEIVED MANY COMMENTS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST THIS BILL AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMENTS ARE INDEED REYES. I'D NEXT LIKE THIS AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN FOR WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON WHAT I BELIEVE ARE STRONG AMENDMENTS. THAT DOCTOR WEBER LAID OUT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING CONSTITUTIONALITY AND ADD MORE SPECIFICS TO THE BILL'S INTENT. WE ALL AGREE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACT WHENEVER A PHYSICIAN DEVIATES EGREGIOUSLY FROM THE STANDARD OF CARE. AND THIS BILL CONFIRMS THAT THERE IS NO EXCEPTION IT FOR THE SPREAD OF CODE NINETEEN MISINFORMATION WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM- AND ARE ABLE. TO TAKE A VOTE. MISTER LOWE THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE HEARING. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND. AGENDA ITEM ON TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU. THEY MAKE THEIR SECOND AGENDA ITEMS ON CONSENT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD AGENDA ITEM- YEP READY WHEN YOUR DOCTOR WEBER. THIS WILL BE A BE SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX. PLEASE OUR DRIVER GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX THE PATIENT PROTECTION ACT A BILL TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENCE IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION BY ENSURING PHYSICIANS CONVICTED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THEIR LICENSE REVOKED AND CANNOT. ACQUIRE OR HAVE IT REINSTATED IF THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT WAS DONE TOWARDS ONE OF THEIR PATIENTS. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED INSTANCES WHERE PHYSICIANS COMMITTED ACTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AGAINST THEIR PATIENTS. IN ALL THE REPORTED INSTANCES THE PHYSICIAN EITHER HAD THEIR LICENSE REVOKED OR THE POSITION SURRENDER THEIR LIFE. THESE POSITION SUBSEQUENTLY PETITIONED THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA FOR LICENSOR REINSTATEMENT AND ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THE MEDICAL BOARD REINSTATED REINSTATED TEN. OF THE SEVENTEEN OR ABOUT 60% OF THOSE PETITIONING PHYSICIANS. THANK GOD IT TO DOCTORS WHO ABUSED TEENAGE GIRLS AND ONE WHO BEAT TWO FEMALE PATIENTS WHEN THEY REPORTED HIM FOR SEXUALLY EXPLOITING THEM. CURRENTLY A PERSON MAY PETITION THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR REINSTATEMENT AFTER THREE YEARS AFTER HAVING THEIR LICENSE REVOKED OR SURRENDERED FOR UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. THE MEDICAL BOARD MAY SPECIFY IN ORDER THAT A PETITION FOR REINSTATEMENT MAY BE FILED AFTER TWO YEARS. AS WE KNOW THE MEDICAL BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LICENSURE REGULATION AND DISCIPLINE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. THIS THING LAW REQUIRES THAT THE BOARD DENY A PHYSICIAN'S AND SURGEON'S CERTIFICATE TO ANYONE WHO IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER AN EXISTING LAW MAKES AN APPLICANT IN ELIGIBLE TO REAPPLY FOR THAT CERTIFICATE FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS THE EFFECTIVE EIGHT. OR NINE OUT OF THEIR APPLICATION. APPLICANTS FREQUENTLY REAPPLY AFTER THE THREE YEAR WAITING PERIOD AND THE BOARD FREQUENTLY REINSTATES THOSE APPLICANTS CERTIFICATES. SO THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT PHYSICIANS TO COMMIT THIS EGREGIOUS CONDUCT TURNING THEIR PATIENTS INTO THEIR PREY SHOULD NOT PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA. AND REMOVE THE DISCRETION THAT THEY WOULD EVER PRACTICE IN THE STATE AGAIN. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORTED BY AN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIAN GYNECOLOGISTS DISTRICT NINE CALIFORNIA.

GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SO THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX I WANT TO STATE CLEARLY THAT WE AGREE WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS TOO BROAD AND IN FACT INCLUDES- CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT POSE A CURRENT DANGER TO THE PUBLIC. THE BILL IN FACT HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING THAT IT WOULD ADD TO THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS WHICH IS PROJECTED AT THIS POINT THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY THREE. L. PREVENT FOLKS WHO ARE OTHERWISE QUALIFIED FROM LICENSURE. SO THE FOR THE WHO DON'T ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON SEX GENDER REGISTRY TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS IN FACT IT'S A FASTEST GROWING PART OF OUR REGISTRY. AND SO WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO CHECKED ME IN SOUTHEAST AND FOR THOSE WHO SOUTHEAST IMPACT YOU- PEOPLE IN HER HIGH SCHOOL. AND SHE WAS CONVICTED OF- PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING CHILD **** AGAIN THESE WERE NEW SELFIE.

BUT UNTIL THAT TIME WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON- TWO ADDITIONAL PRESENTERS THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER THANK YOU THANKS. SO WE HAVE LET ME MAKE SURE I GET THIS. IN THE RIGHT ORDER I BELIEVE AS A MEMBER KALRA IS UP NEXT. WITH ITEM NUMBER FIVE ON THE AGENDA AB. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPTION PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. FOUR YEARS AGO AB TWENTY FIFTEEN WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ALLOWED VETERINARIANS DISCUSS THE USE OF CANNABIS WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR STATE LICENSE AND CANNABIS FOR THERAPEUTIC THE PEDIC ANIMAL USE ACCESSIBLE TO CONSUMERS TO REGULATED DISPENSARIES. HOWEVER AB TWENTY TWO FIFTEEN DID NOT EXPRESSLY ALLOW VETERINARIANS TO RECOMMEND CANNABIS USE. SAYS THEN THERE'S BEEN MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF CANNABIS USE IN ANIMALS IN FACT MANY PET OWNERS ARE ALREADY AWARE THESE FINDINGS ARE GIVING THEIR ANIMALS. CANNABIS PRODUCTS UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE LACK OF AUTHORITY IN EXISTING LAW THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE PET OWNERS ARE DOING SO WITHOUT ANY RECOMMENDATION OR GUIDANCE. FROM A VETERINARIAN. IT'S TIME TO ALLOW VETERINARIANS RECOMMEND SAFE REGULATED THERAPEUTIC CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR THEIR ANIMAL PATIENTS. IF WE DO NOT PET OWNERS WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TURN TO UNSAFE PET CANNABIS PRACTICES. LIKE THE GIVEN THEIR ANIMALS CANNABIS PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR HUMANS OR LYING RELYING UPON UNREGULATED UNDERGROUND MARKET. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD TO ADOPT GUIDELINES FOR VETERINARIANS TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY RECOMMEND THE USE OF CANNABIS DERIVED THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS ON AN ANIMAL. WITHIN THE VETERINARIAN CLIENT PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. SIMILAR A SIMILAR GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICIANS RECOMMENDING CANNABIS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. TO ENSURE THAT CANADA'S PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR ANIMAL USE ARE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS ON THE REGULATED MARKET. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE ADDS THEM TO THE EXISTING DEFINITION OF CANNABIS. PRODUCTS UNDER MAO CARISSA AND REQUIRES THEM TO A DEAR TO CANNABIS REGULATIONS AND RELEVANT MANUFACTURING PACKAGING LABELING STANDARDS. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE STRIKES A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN THE EXISTING COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CANNABIS AND THE ABILITY FOR VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS PROVIDE CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE TO THEIR CLIENTS. THIS BROWN'S WILL ENSURE TAT PETS CAN SAFELY BENEFIT FROM THE MANY THERAPEUTIC USES OF CANNABIS. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION BUSINESS GROUPS OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THE BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY WHEN THE NATION'S. LEADING ANIMAL WELFARE AND RESCUE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY SUPPORT IS ELIZABETH ORECK NATIONAL MANAGER INITIALLY IS A BEST. WITH THE BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY AND PAMELA LOPEZ. ON BEHALF OF THE PET CANNABIS COALITION. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU MISTER KALRA DID ANY SPECIFIC ORDER FOR THE PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD SURE- GOOD MORNING MR BERMAN WHEN I'M CANNABIS DISPENSARIES OPENED JANUARY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LICENSED AND LEGAL PET CANNABIS PRODUCTS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE. UNFORTUNATELY REGULATORY AGENCIES REALIZED MID YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS SPECIFICALLY AND THEY WERE PULLED FROM THE MARKET. NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU LOVE YOUR DOG OR YOU LOVE YOUR CAT AND- THE LIFESAVING TREATMENT FOR LEPROSY FOR THAT MORE ARTHRITIS OR A WHOLE RANGE OF AILMENTS FOR WHICH CANNABIS IS EFFECTIVE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP TAKING CARE OF THEM SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE THERAPIES WHICH YOU KNOW TO BE EFFECTIVE HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF OF THE MARKET. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THE RESEARCH WHICH WE'VE SUBMITTED TO COMMITTEE SHOWS THAT CANNABIS IS A SAFE THERAPY FOR PAT'S- SOMETIMES HUMAN PRODUCTS ARE NOT A SAFE THERAPY FOR PETS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN AN UPTICK. IN ANECDOTAL REPORTS FROM VETERINARY A VERY LOVING PET PARENTS WERE ACCIDENTALLY MADE THEIR PAT ILL WITH HUMAN CANNABIS THIS BILL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA MENTIONED WILL ALLOW PET PARENTS TO DO THE BEHAVIORS WHICH COME NATURALLY. AND EMPOWER THEM TO DO THOSE BEHAVIORS WHICH IS TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR PETS ONE BY HAVING ACCESS TO CLEAR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM VETERINARY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. AND TO BY BEING EASILY ABLE TO FIND CLEARLY UP PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLEARLY LABELED WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON DOSING AND SO FORTH FOR THE PATS I THIS IS A BILL THAT'S TIME HAS COME TWO YEARS IS TOO LONG FOR PEOPLE. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE PRODUCTS WITH CLEAR INSTRUCTION AFTER THEY WERE ON THE- THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ELIZABETH ORIC- ON THE PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN FIND ELIZABETH. LINE AND OPEN IT UP A GREAT. HER LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING TERRY BERMAN AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ELIZABETH ORECK AND I AM THE NATIONAL MANAGER OF CAMPAIGNS AND INITIATIVES FOR BEST FRIENDS ANIMAL SOCIETY AND NATIONAL ANIMAL WELFARE AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA MEMBERS SUPPORT. FOR NURSING STAFF IN FULL SUPPORT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY HALF A MILLION DOGS AND CATS ENTERED CALIFORNIA SHELTERS AND MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND WERE KILLED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO CALL HOME. VETERANS IS COMMITTED TO GETTING THAT NUMBER TO ZERO SO THAT EVERY PETTING CALIFORNIA SHELTERS IS ABLE TO FIND A HOME AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO ACHIEVE THOSE POSITIVE OUTCOMES IS TO ENSURE THAT PETS HAVE ACCESS TO ANY AND ALL THERAPIES THAT MIGHT INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING ADOPTED. PETS SEND UP IN SHELTERS BRIONY REASONS OFTEN IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE FACING PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY ADDRESSED AND SOMETIMES THOSE DOWN TO THE KIRBY THEY'VE LANDED IN A SHELTER FOR SOME PATHS THERAPEUTIC CANNABIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL TO HELP THEM GET WELL AND HAVE THEIR BEST CHANCE AT ADOPTION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CANNABIS MAY BE AN APPROPRIATE THERAPY FOR ILLNESSES AS PROFOUND AS APPLE UPSEE. OR CONDITIONS AS COMMON AS ARTHRITIS PAIN ALTHOUGH CANNABIS IS ACCESSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA GUIDANCE ON ISSUES IS CURRENTLY NOT. X. TO ALLOW THAT PAT PARENTS AND REST.

THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED INCLUDES THE DOCTOR'S NAME AND ADDRESS TRAINING TECHNIQUES AND PHILOSOPHY TRAINING PLAN ANY CIVIL JUDGMENTS RELATED TO THE DOG TRAINER SERVICES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE CERTIFIED OR LICENSED AS OUR WITNESSES WILL TESTIFY. TOO MANY OWNERS HAVE BEEN DOG OWNERS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TRAINERS WHO WITHHOLD THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING TECHNIQUES WE HAVE LISTENED TO A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM GROUPS ABOUT THIS BILL. THROUGH THESE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE AMENDED THIS BILL SIGNIFICANTLY BY CUTTING THE PERIPHERY AND FOCUSING ON THE CORE INTENT INCREASING DISCLOSURE. IN THE TRANSACTION BETWEEN DOG OWNERS AND THEIR TRAINERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION- I BELIEVE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES THANK YOU US HONORING HIS AREA THEN ES I BELIEVE YOU ARE JANE CRESSWELL AND LORNE. TESTIFYING BY PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE START WITH JANE CRESSWELL BECAUSE SHE'S FOR SOME A SHEET. TWO TO TESTIFY AGAIN EVERYBODY GET TWO MINUTES- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PER WITNESS. WELL I AM APEC COUNTER IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN- I HIRED A DOG TRAINER WHO ALSO- WITH PORTING ONE OF MY DOGS BUT BOTH DOG HAPPENED TO BE THERE AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS GOING ON VACATION- DOG ENDED UP KILLING. MY ONE DOG THAT RECORDED WITH HER AT NIGHT OTHER DOG WAS SEVERELY NAMES. AND HAD MANY MANY MEDICAL ISSUES- I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THE PAST BUT IT ALSO PROTECTS THE- OWNER THAT THE PET. NO HISTORY AND INFORMATION OF THE DOG TRAINER AND IN MY CASE I DIDN'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A BILL LIKE THAT- I JUST WENT BASED ON HER WEBSITE WHICH SAID THAT SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE DOG TRAINER IN MY AREA. AND I MET THE PERSON AND SHE SEEMS LIKE SHE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TRAIN A DOG. SO ITRUSTED HER AND I INSTRUCTED MY DOG WITH HER AND ONE WAS KILLED BY HER DOG AND SHE WAS VERY DISHONEST ABOUT. HER QUALIFICATIONS AND HISTORY ONCE I DID GET A BIT MORE INTO HER BACKGROUND I FOUND OUT THAT YOU KNOW SHE SHE MISREPRESENTED HERSELF SO I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK. IT'S IT'LL BE IN WRITING AND I THINK IT'LL PROTECT A PET OWNERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AS IT BEFORE WE GO TO MS MYERS WE HAVE A QUORUM I WANT TO CAPTURE THIS MOMENT AND- GAVIN BE NOTED IN THE RECORD. SO MR SECRETARY WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BERMAN HERE FOR ARAMBULA MMHM BONTA CHEN CUNNINGHAM DALY FONG GIPSON GRAYSON R. ONE. ME MCCARTY MEDINA MULLIN CHAIN WARD WEBER. GREAT WE HAVE A QUORUM SORRY ABOUT THAT MS MYERS- OPERATOR PLEASE IDENTIFY MS MYERS LINE AND OPENED IT SO SHE CAN TESTIFY AHEAD. YES HELLO MY NAME IS LAUREN MYERS AND I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN NO ONE MY FAMILY EXPERIENCED TERRIBLE HEARTBREAK AT THE HANDS OF OUR DOG TRAINER OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND HAD THERE BEEN CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS WE NEVER WOULD HAVE TRAVELED DOWN THIS ROAD MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH DISABLED VETERANS AND OUR OLDEST CHILD IS AUTISTIC WE REALLY NEEDED HELP AND TRAINING ARE DURABLE BUT HIGHLY ENERGETIC GERMAN SHEPHERD FOR. WE HOPE STORE COULD BE TRAINED TO BE A SERVICE ANIMAL FOR OUR DAUGHTER AND SHE HAD FORGED A VERY STRONG BOND WITH HIM HE CAME FROM A LINE OF EXTREMELY WELL TRAINED DOG. UNFORTUNATELY WE WOULD HAND OVER OUR BELOVED PUPPY ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN. NOT KNOWING WE WOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. WE AGREED UPON AND PAID FOR A MONTH A BOARDING AND TRAINING AND THROUGH THE COURSE OF THAT TIME. THE TRAINERS COMMUNICATION SLOWLY DECREASED AND AFTER THE FIRST MONTH HE TOLD US HE NEEDED MORE TIME. A MONTH LATER HE TOLD US HE HAD TAKEN OUR DOG OUT OF STATE WHILE HE WAS TRAINING OTHER DOC. AS WE CONTINUE TO PRESS THEM FOR INFORMATION IN ASKING FOR DOOR TO BE RETURNED BECAUSE HE FINALLY REFUSED TO SEND PICTURES OR UPDATE THE BILL ARE. WE HAD NO IDEA WHERE TO FIND THEM. WE FINALLY GOT THE POLICE INVOLVED IN IT WAS THEN WE DISCOVERED THAT HE NO LONGER HAD DOOR AND REFUSED TO SAY WHERE HE BOUGHT. THIS IS THE START OF AN AWFUL EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER TO NAVIGATE WITH MY CHILDREN AS THEY STILL HOPE TO THIS DAY. THAT THE TRAINER WILL TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO FULLER. I DO NOT WISH ANY FAMILY TO GO THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. SO MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN HELP PUT AN END TO THESE NOW INTENDED AND MALICIOUS DOG TRAINERS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FAMILIES AND THEIR BELOVED PAT. I BELIEVE THAT HAD THE REQUIREMENTS BABY NINETEEN NO ONE DID IN PLACE WHEN I WAS FIRST CONSIDERING A DOG TRAINER. WE NEVER WOULD HAVE WORKED WITH HIM. I HOPE THAT WOULD INCREASE REQUIREMENTS FAMILIES WHO NEED HELP IN TRAINING THEIR DOGS WILL BE ABLE TO FIND RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY PROVIDERS. WHO RETURN THEIR PET HAPPY. HEALTHY AND SAFE WE TRAINED.

I'M DOCTOR LARRY BUT DARD- I'M EMERGENCY POSITION SPEAKING AS AN INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS A CANNABIS ADVOCATE THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL ONE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS IS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN. TO MEDICAL CANNABIS IS A VERY SAFE DRUGS AND THREE MANY PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN WHO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THEIR USE OF OPIOIDS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE PUBLISHED REPORT HEALTH EFFECTS OF CANNABIS AND CANNABINOIDS THEY REVIEWED FIFTEEN THOUSAND- ITEMS OF RESEARCH AND FOUND CONCLUSIVE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS WAS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN.

THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS ARE UNABLE TO STAND MY APPRECIATION BOTH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE AS USUAL OF FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH PROVIDE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA FLEXIBILITY AND DETERMINING- IT'S- DISCIPLINARY- PANELS- MEMBERSHIP. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED HARSH CRITICISM REGARDING ITS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST PHYSICIANS IN RECENT YARS. SOME CONSUMER ADVOCATES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE LOST TRUST IN THE BOARDING OF CALLED FOR REFORM ON MANY OF ITS FUNCTIONS. AND THIS BILL IS SEPARATE FROM ANY OF THAT. WE'RE NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT. WHETHER THE BOARD DOES A GOOD JOB OR DOESN'T DO A GOOD JOB OR HAS THE AUTHORITY OR DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS- THE CALL TO ALL. IS TO- MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS ASKING THAT THE- BOARD EITHER AT B. RIGHT NOW IT CAN HAVE AN EVEN BALANCE BETWEEN LATE PEOPLE AND MEDICAL PEOPLE. OR IT CAN HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL PERSON THIS WOULD MAKE IT SOUTHERLY THE BNP EVEN BALANCE OR THERE WILL BE ONE PERSON ONE MORE LAKEPORT. AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT. CONSUMERS AND ADVOCATES CAN FEEL THAT THE BOARD ITSELF IS WELL BALANCED AND IS MAKING DECISIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT HERE. WE'RE GOING TO SKIP ALL THE OTHER STUFF THIS IS JUST ABOUT GETTING CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD BACK. HI HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS CRISTINA LAWSON PRESIDENT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. AND KAREN STEFANO DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION POLICY CENTER. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO LAW SCHOOL. THANK YOU DR COURT WHILE WE START WITH MS LAWSON. THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTINA LAWSON I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA THE BOARD IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY SIXTY AND IS GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY IS ONE OF THE NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR LEGISLATION THAT THE BOARD DISTRIBUTED THE LEGISLATURE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR THE BOARD'S REQUESTED STATUTORY CHANGES WILL HELP RESTORE TRUST IN THE BOARD BY HELPING TO ENSURE IT HAS THE FINANCIAL MEANS AND ENFORCEMENT TOOLS. NECESSARY TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS INTENDED TO INCREASE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD'S OPERATIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORK NOTICES THE BOARD HAS BEEN UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND FROM NUMEROUS PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS. LAST YEAR DURING OUR BOARD SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS AND THE PROCESS TO CONFIRM SEVEN OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS BY THE SENATE WE FACED QUESTIONS ABOUT A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING WHETHER THE BOARD IS SUFFICIENTLY FOCUSED ON ITS MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. AS DISCUSSED IN THE BILL'S ANALYSIS AND REFLECTED IN RECENT MEDIA COVERAGE MANY ARGUE THAT OUR LICENSEES AND THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THEM HAVE TOO MUCH INFLUENCE ON BOARD POLICY. ALTHOUGH THE BOARD DISAGREES WITH THIS CRITICISM WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY HAVE LOST TRUST IN THE BOARD AND QUESTION WHETHER WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE PRIORITIES. CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD TO MOVE FROM A PHYSICIAN MEMBER MAJORITY TO A PUBLIC MEMBER MAJORITY IS SUPPORTED BY CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT AND MEANINGFUL STEPS TO HELP REASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT THE BOARD IS ADEQUATELY FOCUSED ON ITS MISSION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ON BEHALF OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU MISTER MS LAWSON AND THANK YOU FOR SERVING ON THE BOARD- AND I BELIEVE THE- CARE AND STEPHANO- BY PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY.

HI GOOD MORNING I'M CALLING- FOR ANY- REPRESENTING THE PARENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF REMOVING ALL OF THESE EVIL BILLS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH OUR CHILDREN. OKAY YOUR DOCTOR WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT IN Q. EITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIXTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS STARTING ON MY LEFT. GOING TO MY RIGHT DR WEBER. THANK YOU CHAIR AND DAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY I THINK- WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD. I'M NOT REALLY QUITE SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. CERTAINLY I'M HOW MANY OTHER PROFESSIONAL BOARDS ARE COMPOSED OF THAT PRIMARILY A PUBLIC MAJORITY- I DO NOT NOW AND- THIS IS. THIS IS ONE BILL FOR ME. AND IF YOU CAN PLEASE TELL ME OKAY THANK YOU SO- ACUPUNCTURE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE VOCATIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS HAVE A PUBLIC MAJORITY LICENSE MAJORITY CHIROPRACTIC DENTAL BOARD DENTAL HYGIENISTS MEDICAL BOARD RURAL PASSED OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY OPTOMETRY- NBC PHARMACY PHYSICAL THERAPY PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS PODIATRY PSYCHOLOGY B. R. N. S. L. P. H. A. D. AND VETERINARY MEDICINE. AND THERE'S ALSO A BILL THAT I GUESS WE WILL HERE AT SOME POINT ABOUT ESTABLISHING A MIDWIFERY BOARD WHICH THEY ARE PROPOSING FIVE MIDWIVES TO PUBLIC- MEMBERS. I'M HOW MANY TIMES HAS A JUDGMENT OR A VOTE FOR A DISCIPLINARY ACTION AN OFF BY ONE VOTE. THAT'S A QUESTION FOR ME I UNFORTUNATEL DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE- I WILL SAY THAT THAT WITH RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL- THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME- NECESSARILY IT IS TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD AND ITS PROFIT. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT CHANGING THE COMPOSITION ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE BOARD WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE BOARD IT IS WITH THE VOTES WILL BE ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO CHANGE THE OUTCOMES OF THE BOARD'S DECISION OF COURSE ADDING ADDITIONAL PUBLIC MEMBER VOICE WHICH COULD CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD- AND EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS BRING THEIR OWN YOU KNOW PERSPECTIVES- TO THOSE PANEL DECISIONS BUT WE DON'T AT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME. OF THE BOARD NECESSARILY IF TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD. ROOM OKAY SO EVEN WITH THE CHANGE THE WHAT THE ISSUES WERE STILL POTENTIALLY BE THERE. IT'S POSSIBLE OKAY- SO THE L. A. TIMES NOTED- ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES IS THAT THERE IS A DELAY- SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THEIR RESPONSE TO COMPLAINT DO WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARDS WILL IMPROVE THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE. I'M YOU KNOW THE BOARD OR BOARDS HAVE MANY ROLES OUTSIDE OF JESS A DISCIPLINARY ACTION SO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS ALSO IN CHARGE OF APPROVING UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS APPROVING CLINICAL CLERKSHIPS AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS AND HOSPITALS ADMINISTERING THE BOARD'S CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM RCM MEANS I'M AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHY MOST BOARDS ARE COMPOSED OF THOSE THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROFESSION NOT JUST THE DISCIPLINARY THING BUT THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BOARD ITSELF- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE NOTION AND I GUESS THAT'S IS NOT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT PHYSICIANS- WOULD SEIZE. A AND AN ACT- AND NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OR THAT THAT WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN A PATIENT IS HARMED IS NOT JUST THE PATIENT AS THE FAMILY AS A COMMUNITY BUT IT'S ALSO OUR PRACTICE AND THAT WE WOULD NOT ACT ON THAT I GUESS WE'RE NOT STATING THAT THAT IS THE CASE- IT'S JUST FOR PUBLIC PERCEPTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE A VERY MEANINGFUL STEP IN RESTORING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE BOARD THE BOARD HAS FACED. INCREASING SCRUTINY AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS CERTAINLY. OVER THE COURSE OF THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ON THIS BOARD- AND WE DO BELIEVE THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY AGREES IN FACT ALL OF ITS POSITION MEMBERS ALL OF ITS PUBLIC MEMBERS. AGREE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT STAFF- FOR THE PUBLIC. BUT IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY CHANGE THE OTHER THINGS THAT THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING FOR WHICH IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TIME OF DEALING WITH THE COMPLAINTS OR AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TYPES OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THAT THAT THAT THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED. FEEL SHOULD BE DONE THAT'S CORRECT THIS THIS LEGISLATION IS AT ONE OF A NUMBER OF MEASURES- THAT WE BELIEVE- WOULD BE IMPORTANT IF YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BOTH. TO REDUCE THOSE TIMES MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BOARD ARE THOSE ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE MEMO THAT WE DISTRIBUTED TO THE LEGISLATURE I IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. OKAYBUT THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THAT DOESN'T DO IT ON ITS OWN RIGHT NOW BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PACKAGE RIGHT OKAY ALL RIGHT. I'M WELL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER BILLS THAT DO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS CERTAIN ISSUES- ONE OF WHICH WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY WHICH DEALT WITH. YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS THAT SEXUALLY ASSAULT PATIENTS YOU KNOW NOT GETTING THEIR LICENSURE BACK- I DO THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE BUT I THINK THAT THE WAY IN WHICH WE RESTORE CONFIDENCE. IS ACTUALLY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PHYSICIANS WHO SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICING ARE NOT PRACTICING AND THAT WE ARE- RESPONDING. PLANTS AT THE FASHION IN A CHANGING THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD ISN'T GOING TO DO THAT THEN I'M NOT SURE THAT. IT'S THE BEST OUT BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS AND ANSWER MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK DR WEBER. ANY ADDITIONAL. IMMENSE SEEING NINE THIRTY WORK WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SURE BOB. AS MY WITNESS HERE SAID THERE'S A WHOLE PACK AND DR WEBER'S BILL WILL BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT- AND I PARTICULARLY RESPECT DR WEBER AS A PHYSICIAN AND DOCTOR ARAMBULA WHO'S ALSO ON THIS- COMMITTEE. AND YOU KNOW I CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WITH THIS BILL IT WILL NOT CURE EVERYTHING IT DOES IF THERE IF THERE WERE. A BIG DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MEDICAL FOLKS AND V- LAKE PEOPLE ON THE BOARD. THE MEDICAL FOLKS WON'T BE ABLE TO OUT VOTE THE LAY PEOPLE. THAT'S TRUE HOW OFTEN THAT HAPPENS I DON'T KNOW- I THINK AGAIN THERE ARE MANY OTHER BILLS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SOLVING THIS. THIS DOES GUARANTEE THAT YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE DOCTORS ALONE RAM SOMETHING THROUGH THAT THE LATE PEOPLE DON'T AGREE WITH. SO IN THAT IT DOES DO SOMETHING. ARE IT DOESN'T DO AS MUCH AS YOU'RE DOING AND THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF BILLS THEY'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND I WANNA SAY THIS. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE MEDICAL BOARD. REALIZES THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND WANTS TO SOLVE THEM AND THIS IS JUST. ONE OF MANY BILLS PERHAPS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT'S FINE. BUT I DO THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW YOU CAN'T HAVE DOCTORS OVERWHELMINGLY P. THANK YOU DR COURT. SOME ELEMENTS ARE BY SAYING I APPRECIATE THE MEDICAL BOARD'S EFFORTS TO BE PROACTIVE ABOUT IMPROVING ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC AND AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THERE'S A DEBATE. ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS BILL WILL SUBSTANTIVELY CHANGED THE DECISION MAKING BY THE BOARD HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT PERCEPTION IS ALSO IMPORTANT- WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING TRUST AT THE SAME TIME I URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING THE VOICE OF PHYSICIANS WHEN IT COMES TO APPLYING THE STANDARD OF CARE- AND I HOPE THAT DEBATE CONTINUES AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. IN THE MEANTIME WITH THE AUTHORS ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I'M I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND WE NEED A MOTION AND SECOND. OUR MOTION GOT A SECOND MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN. HI BERMAN I FLOOR FLOOR AYE ARAMBULA. BLOOM BONTA CHEN I'M NOT VOTING CUNNINGHAM. SALLY HI FONG. ON AYE GIPSON. GRAYSON GRAYSON AYE IRWIN. BERMAN I AM. WHEN I. LEE MCCARTY DANA MEDINA AYE MULLIN MULLIN HIGHER HAIN WARD WARD I AND WEBER. ANOTHER THING THAT BILL IS OUT I BELIEVE THAT BILL IS OUT WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK EVERYONE AND THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER YOUR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT YOU'RE MAKING. NEXT UP WE HAVE ITEM- CHEN I'M NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY EIGHTY SEVEN BY SOME NUMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU HI MISTER CHAIR I AND GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB AT TWO ZERO EIGHT SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT LIVES BY ENSURING THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE SOLD TO PATIENTS ALIGNS WITH WHAT IS BEING ADVERTISED BY PROVIDERS IN WITH THEIR LICENSE TO DELIVER- I'D FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOUR STAFF ASKING YOURSELF FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND IT THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I NEED FOR THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE OFFERING A DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT SERVICES AND I'M ALL SURE JUST JUST ONE STORY BY WAY OF EXAMPLE. I IN MY DISTRICT LACKS LAST AUGUST A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD MAN WHO WAS LIVING IN AN ADDICTION TREATMENT FACILITY IN NEWPORT BEACH LEFT THE PREMISES AT EXHIBITING SIGNS OF PARANOID TO LARRY I'M HAVING NOT RECEIVED A COCKTAIL OF CONTRAINDICATED MEDICATIONS. TRAGICALLY HE BROKE DOWN THE DOOR OF A NEARBY RESIDENTS AND- WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY THE NEIGHBOR- IT'S CLEAR THAT THIS YOUNG MAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THIS FACILITY WITH MUCH GREATER SUPERVISION VISION MONITORING OF HIS DETOX- THIS TRAGIC EXAMPLE. REALLY DOES HIGHLIGHT I IN MY MIND THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AND I NEED FOR US TO STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDICATIONS PARTICULARLY IN RECOVERY RESIDENTS AS- OP ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT RIGHT NOW IT IS CURRENTLY AN UP HILL BATTLE TO STOP THESE DANGEROUS AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES. AND AT PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES REALLY ARE BEST POSITIONED TO IDENTIFY ROGUE PRACTICES AND ROGUE FACILITIES ARE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ON PROVIDING SERVICES BY UNTRAINED OR AND LICENSE STAFF REALLY IS ON ACCEPTABLE AND DANGEROUS AND WE'VE GOT TO PROVIDE A PATH TO STOP THESE PRACTICES AND THESE UNSCRUPULOUS OPERATORS. ON THIS BILL DOES THAT BY DOING A COUPLE OF THINGS A NUMBER ONE ENABLING PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES YOU TAKE CIVIL ACTION TO HOLD UNSCRUPULOUS RECOVERY FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE. FOR DISPENSING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WITHOUT A LICENSE OR FALSELY ADVERTISING A LEVEL OF CARE. AND NUMBER TWO AUTHORING THE RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES TO A PREVAILING PLAINTIFF. ON JOINING US RIGHT NOW TO TESTIFY AMERICANS LIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO. HAVE I EXPERIENCED. THESE BROKE FACILITIES I WENDY MCINTIRE'S SON JARED PASSED AWAY IN A ROGUE SOBER LIVING HOME. AND WE HAVE NAMES BY THE SPELL CHERUSCI IN HIS HONOR AND MEMORY. I'M AND WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY CHRISTIAN ACHESON WHO IS A FORMER RECOVERY PATIENT- TWENTY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HI MY NAME IS LENNY MCINTYRE ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY ADVOCATE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE BECAUSE OF GERAS LAW I'M- MY SON DIED FROM AN OVERDOSE IN A SOBER LIVING HOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO THE STAFF RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS KERR DID NOTHING TO SAVE A REVIVED HIM HE WAS LEFT OUT SPREADING FOR HOURS ALONE UNTIL HIS LAST BREATH ALL WHILE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS JUST TWO BLOCKS AWAY BUT WHENEVER CALLED. THIS COMPLETE NEGLIGENCE AND LACK OF CARE OPENED MY EYES TO THE UNFORTUNATE FACT THAT I AM NOT ALONE FAMILIES CONTINUED TO SEND THEIR LOVED ONES TO TREATMENT IN HOPES OF THEM FINALLY GETTING HELP. ONLY THEIR LOVED ONES ARE FACING CIRCUMSTANCES MUCH WORSE THAN ADDICTION. AFTER STARTING HERE AS LONG. I HAD MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY ABOUT TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT DECEIVE THE PUBLIC SO THEY CAN PROFIT OFF VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THE WORST PART IS THAT DEATHS THAT SOBER LIVING HOMES AND TREATMENT FACILITIES CONTINUE TO PILE UP. AND SEEM TO GO UNNOTICED BECAUSE- NOTHING PREVENTS FROM THE PUBLIC FROM BEING PROPERLY INFORMED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT A PROPER LEVEL OF TREATMENT HAS RECEIVED FOR PEOPLE SEEKING RECOVERY AT THE FACILITIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WE NEED TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE THAT WOULD REQUIRE A LICENSE IF MEDICATIONS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED. CURRENTLY FACILITIES ARE MAKING PATIENTS SELF ADMINISTER THEIR OWN MEDICATIONS TO AVOID LICENSURE. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PRACTICE AND IT NEEDS TO STOP. I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYWOMAN CARDI PETRIE-NORRIS FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT AND DOGGED DETERMINATION FOR PROTECTING. ALL OF OUR LOVED ONES AND I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER ACHESON. AND DO YEAH I HAD THE BUTTON RIGHT THERE THANK YOU.

OF THE LOCAL FOOT AND ANKLE THEY WOULD NEED AT LEAST A CALIFORNIA X. RAY TECHNICIAN LIMITED PERMIT IN THE ALLEGE. BUT HE ADDRESS CATEGORY. WELL MORE EXTENSIVE X RAY PERMITS MAY BE AVAILABLE THEY FAR EXCEED. THE SCOPE OF IDOLATRY AS SUCH DOCTORS OF PODIATRIC MEDICINE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND EXTRA TAX ONE TO WORK IN PODIATRIC OFFICE BE LIMITED TO ONLY PERFORMING PODIATRIC RADIOGRAPHY. THIS IS NOT A DIRE SHORTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS. AVAILABLE TO SYSTEM PERFORM X. RAYS AND PUT ADDRESS OFFICES WHICH CREATES A SITUATION THAT HARMS INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP PRACTICES ABILITY. TO PROVIDE PROPER CARE. RESULTING ACT EITHER NOT BE PER. REFERRED TO OUTSIDE CENTERS OR OTHER IN FREE MODALITIES BEING EMPLOYED THIS ENDANGERS THE PUBLIC. ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM A. B. SEVENTEEN ZERO FOUR ONE CREW THE PATHWAY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO OBTAIN AND LIMITED X. RAY PERMIT BUT I TREATING. THE AUTHORIZING THE PODIATRIC MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND A RADIOLOGIC HEALTH BRANCH O JOINTLY-APPROVED. A NEW COMPREHENSIVE COURSE THAT WILL PROBABLY TRAIN THEM TO PERFORM THESE X. RAYS ON SPECIALIZED. BRADRICK EXTRA EQUIPMENT WITH BUILT IN SAFETY FEATURES PACIFIC TO THE FOOT AND ANKLE. HEREBY ARE PREVENTING THE OVER CERTIFICATION TECHNICIANS AND COURAGE TO FEEL THE PRIDE TREE. QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. A CURE TODAY TO TESTIFY IS DR KHAIRUL AND DOCTOR CARRIED BALL A CONDUCTED BALL. GREAT AND YOU KNOW ARE THEY TESTIFYING BUT VIA PHONE AT YES THIS IS ERIC GREAT.

ACTUALLY ALL DUE RESPECT PLEASE DO NOT A DOCTOR BALL WILL GO FIRST GO AHEAD THANKS. PLEASE CLICK HERE- I AM OF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'M A PRACTICING PODIATRIST IN LOS ANGELES AND- I AM A SERDES CAL- THE PRESIDENT OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUT ENTERED MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WE INCLUDING ENTERED MEDICINE HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE ARE NEED. ARE IN NEED OF YOUR HELP. I THANK YOU FOR A LONG US TO SPEAK DATE ADDRESS PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING IN KOREA YOUR OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT IS THE INABILITY TO FIND ANY. QUAL AND- TO PERFORM LIMITED X. RAYS OF THE FOOT AND ANKLE. AT ANY GIVEN DAY IN A PODIATRIC MEDICAL OFFICE ONLY ABOUT 20% OF OUR PATIENTS REQUIRE AN X. RAY THIS PROCESS INVOLVES THE USE OF PLAIN X. RAYS USING A TYPE OF DIGITAL EQUIPMENT. WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO THE FOOT AND ANKLE AND WHICH HAS BUILT IN SAFETY FEATURES. MANY OF THE COMMON TECHNOLOGIES WE TREAT INCLUDING TRAUMA INFECTION PRE AND POST SURGICAL CARE ALL REQUIRE AN IMMEDIATE X. RAY READINGS TO DETERMINE PROPER TREATMENT. FAILURE TO OBTAIN AN IMMEDIATE READ CAN DIRECTLY AFFECT THE TRAJECTORY OF THOSE PATHOLOGIES. WITHOUT QUALIFIED STAFF AVAILABLE TO ASSIST US THE REALITY OF TIME MANAGEMENT MOST PODIA ETTRICK OFFICES MAKES IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PODIATRIST TO TAKE OUR OWN X. RAYS EVEN THOUGH WE ARE CERTIFIED BY THE RADIOLOGIC HEALTH BRANCH. AS RADIOLOGY SUPERVISORS AND OPERATORS THE REALITY IS THAT ACTUALLY STUDIES ARE EITHER AVOIDED ENTIRELY OR SENT TO TERTIARY FACILITIES WITH THE RESULTANT DELAY IN CARE. TO ENSURE PATIENTS RECEIVE IMMEDIATE CARE THEY NEED BUT I CHRIS SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM TECHNICIANS TO PERFORM IN OFFICE X. RAY. THESE INDIVIDUALS OR PODIA ETTRICK MEDICAL SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TECHNICIANS WHO PERFORM X. RAYS IN THAT THEIR PRIMARY DUTY IS CHAIR SIDE. WHAT NANGLE X. RAYS ARE SECONDARY DUTY. IT COULD BE MISSED. THE SIR X. X. SUCH AS ONE MIGHT WORK CORPORATE GROUP COULD BE UP HERE HOWEVER EVEN IGNORE THE FINANCIAL. THAT THEY COMMAND MUCH HIGHER SALARIES THIS WOULD BE AN ERROR THOSE EXTREMITY. UNDERSTANDABLY TO PRACTICE THEIR FULL SCOPE SOLELY AS RADIOLOGY TAX AND NOT AS PRIMARILY MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

WELL CALIFORNIA HAS A CLEAR PATH FOR MANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO MEET STATE AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS AND OFFER FEDERAL AID TO THEIR STUDENTS. THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION EXCLUDES PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ESTABLISHED BY ANOTHER STATE. THIS IS THE LACK OF CERTIFICATION BY THE BUREAU THUS PREVENTS STUDENTS AS INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY WHICH HAS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA.

TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO. READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WITH I WHICH WILL NARROW THE BILL TO THE LIGHT FIXTURES BEING INSTALLED OR REPLACED AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY 70% OF ALL BIRD SPECIES MIGRATE EACH YEAR. OF THOSE BIRDS 80% MIGRATE AT NIGHT USING THE NIGHT SKY TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE TO AND FROM THE BREEDING GROUNDS EXCESSIVE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IS AFFECTING ECOSYSTEMS AND CAN DISRUPT CRITICAL BEHAVIOR IN WILDLIFE THIS INCLUDES EXTRACTING NOT NOCTURNAL MIGRATORY BIRDS AND DIVERTING THEM FROM SAFE MIGRATION ROUTES HUMAN VARMINTS WHERE THEY ARE. MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLLISIONS WITH BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES. ARTIFICIAL LIGHT CAN ALSO AFFECT INSECT MOVEMENT FORGING AND REPRODUCTION WHEN CAUGHT IN A WHITE PLUME OF A LIGHT FIXTURE. THE CIRCLE AROUND UNTIL THEY DIE THE LIGHT IS EXTINGUISHED. EXCESSIVE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING ALSO HAS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON HUMANS. TEENS AND ADOLESCENTS WHO LIVE IN AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. AS WELL AS INTERRUPTED SLEEP PATTERNS. THE INTERNATIONAL DARK SKY ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT AT LEAST 30% OF OUTDOOR LIGHTING IN THE UNITED STATES IS WASTED PRIMARILY BY LIGHTS AREN'T COVERED. THESE WASTE LIGHTS TOTALED THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSS OF TRICITY COSTS EVERITT. AND RELEASED TWENTY ONE MILLION TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE PER YEAR. THIS BILL REQUIRE THAT ALL. OUTDOOR LIGHTING FIXTURES INSTALLED OR REPLACED ON STATE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. HAVE AN EXTERNAL SHIELD TO DIRECT BILL THE LIGHT TO WHERE IT IS NEEDED. EQUIPPED WITH THE AUTOMATIC OR SHUT OFF DEVICE. OR BE MOTION ACTIVATED. THE CENTER FORM PROMOTES SAFETY FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS INSECTS AND PEOPLE. THANKFULLY AFTER AYE VOTE.

WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR NATIONAL PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC LANDS FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL IN THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION OF IT. ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT CAN HAVE WIDE RANGING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO WORKS TO ENSURE THAT OUTDOOR NIGHT LIGHTING ON CERTAIN STATE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES FOCUSES. ON MEETING THE GOALS OF LIGHTING WHILE REDUCING UNINTENDED IMPACTS TO OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES AND CAPABILITIES TO SOLVE IN AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO PROVIDES. NEEDED DIRECTION. ARE THE UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE IN ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING AT NIGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND GLOBALLY. IS RESULTING IN THE DESTRUCTION AND IN THE DAILY RHYTHMS AND WILDLIFE- AS AUTHOR REFERENCE IN HIS REMARKS. OF FOR EXAMPLE THIS DAILY CYCLE OF LIGHT AND DARK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LIFE SUSTAINING BEHAVIORS. SUCH AS REPRODUCTION NOURISHMENT SLEEP AND PROTECTION FROM PREDATORS ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM. FROM PLANTS AND INSECTS TO AMPHIBIANS AND MAMMALS SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A- REALLY LARGE PORTION OF OUR ECOSYSTEM- AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO HELPS PROTECT OUR NIGHT SKY IN BIO SPHERE.

TOTAL TWENTY FOUR A MAJOR CAUSE FOR. OF COST EFFICIENT LED LUMINAIRES CURRENTLY AVAILABLE STATE WIDE FOR MY PROFESSIONAL DESIGN EXPERIENCE IN VIRTUALLY ALL TYPES OF OUTDOOR LIGHTING I CAN. UNEQUIVOCALLY SAY THERE IS NO COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORDINARY OUTDOOR LIGHTING AND LIGHTING IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND HELPS MAINTAIN THE NATURALLY DARK SKY. EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT OF AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY TWO AND SOLUTION IF TOWARDS PRODUCING STATEWIDE REGULATIONS RESPONSIBLE INEFFICIENT OUTDOOR LIGHTING. IN COORDINATION WITH CALGARY.

MISTER CHAIR WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER TURN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY THE CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDRESSING COMPLAINTS ABOUT CONTRACTORS BY PUBLICLY DISCLOSING DETAILS OF MINOR COMPLAINTS AND LETTERS OF ADMONISHMENTS FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THE LETTER IS SERVED. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTEEN WOULD EXTEND SOME OF THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURES OF MINOR COMPLAINTS AND LETTERS OF ADMONISHMENT TO TWO YEARS BACK SPENT EXTENDING THE TIMELINE THIS WILL PROVIDE IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY TO CONSUMERS AND INCREASE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONSUMER PROTECTION IS BEST SERVED WHEN THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO RECORDS OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE BOARD. ADDITIONALLY ADDITIONALLY THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE PERIOD FOR LETTERS OF ADMONISHMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER THAN ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS WHICH IS A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING BY PHONE IS ROB FONG FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I'M ASSUMING OF SACRAMENTO KNOWING THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND WHITNEY FONG. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE LET ME QUICKLY CHECK WITH THE CONSULTANT DO I NEED TO ACCEPT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. YES I WILL I'M HAPPY DOES ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL- THAT THE CHAIR WAS SO WISE IN SUGGESTING- AND WITH THAT LET'S. MOVE IT TO THE WITNESSES FOR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO FIRST WRITTEN ROBERT WHITNEY FONG BY PHONE. THANK YOU HIGH- MY NAME IS ROB FONG IS THE- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED- I AM NOT A- FORMER CITY COUNCILMEMBER SURE INSTEAD SACRAMENTO AND- JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT- IN MY WIFE'S CAR BUT THE COMPANY ATTORNEYS WE WENT THROUGH AN- EIGHT. MONTH THE THAT TOOK TWO AND A HALF YEARS. OF THE JOB IS NOT FINISHED CONTRACTOR WALKED OFF THE JOB STUDENTS BOB MECHANICS NEED AND- YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT LAWSUIT FOR THREE YEARS AND SO. HOMEOWNERS REALLY NEED MORE PROTECTIONS FROM HOME REMODELING CONTRACTORS  JOB. CONSUMERS DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND UPON THIS AREA WE'RE BOTH ATTORNEYS AND WE DIDN'T. ONCE WE MOTHER STARTS WORK ON YOUR HOME THE HOMEOWNER WILL BE AT THE MERCY OF THE CONTRACT ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF TIMELINE AND COST SO. YOU KNOW MOST CONSUMERS DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S AGAINST MARK REQUEST PAYMENTS FOR WORK BEFORE IT'S DONE WE DIDN'T- MANY CONTRACTORS DON'T COMMIT A SUBMIT WRITTEN CHANGE ORDERS ON JOBS AND MOST CONSUMERS DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS REQUIRED BY LAW SO. YOU KNOW MANY MANY CONTRACTORS DO NOT ACTUALLY AVERAGE AND UNDER THE BOARD TO PUT THE CONTRACT SO. WE WILL BE IN. OF THIS OF THIS BILL EIGHT TWENTY NINE SIX IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ANYTHING THE CS BEACON YOU TO CALL. PUT CONCERN FROM CONTRA. IS THE STORE NEEDED AND- THERE'S JUST LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK OUT IN THE WORLD AND STUFF. REALLY APPRECIATE YOU CAN THIS TAKING THE- WITH YOU. THANK YOU MUCH. THAT'S WHAT THE ON THE PHONE PLEASE. IN SUPPORT. HI WHAT MADE BY I'M ROB WIFE I'M SORRY ALL THE WAY I DIDN'T HEAR EVERYTHING HE SAYING I'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT- THE PROPOSAL IS AB. NINE SIXTEEN AND THE ONE THAT I HAVE TO SAY IS IN MY WORK WITH A LOT OF CONTRA- WE A BRAND THREE MODEL SITUATION BUT I ALSO PUT HOME AND YOU WERE. THEY ARE. I SEARCH- BY ALMOST ANY. AT THE CFL. R. BY NAME BY THANK. NUMBER BY LICENSE NUMBER. THE PEOPLE OFTEN CHANGE THEIR NAMES THEIR BUSINESS NAMES THEIR PERSONAL NAME. HAVE BEEN ACTION HE AGAINST- AND WAY TO OUT OF FUTURE COSTS FIND THAT INFORMATION AGES FREE REGISTER UNDER DIFFERENT SAME- I UNDERSTAND THAT BOB THIS PARTICULAR SOLUTION DOESN'T ADDRESS STOPS BUT WHAT IT DOES THE DRIVE. IS ALLOWING EVIDENCE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TO BE ON THEIR FILE FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS I'M NOT SURE WHY IT WOULDN'T BE PERMANENT I UNDERSTAND THAT EXTENSION. FROM ONE YEAR TO TWO YEARS IS VERY HELPFUL BOB AS AN ATTORNEY AND A MEMBER OF THE STATE FARM ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THAT THE- ON OUR FILE FOR OUR LIFELINE BECAUSE RELEVANT INFORMATION. THAT THE CONSUMER NEEDS AND NOW SO I THINK THE FACT THAT ANY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR AGAIN WE'RE NOT HERE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CHANGING THE STANDARDS OF REVIEW OR CHANGING- THE STANDARD FOR DISAPPOINTING THE CONTRACTOR THIS IS JUST ONE THE SEATTLE HAVE DECIDED TO. THE CONTRACTOR IF SOMETHING FUTURE CONSUMER CONCERN AGAIN LIKE I SAID CONTRACTORS A PROFESSIONAL THAT HE BEATING THOSE SEARCHES I GOT FRIENDS OF MINE NOT BE ABLE TO FIND INFORMATION ON THE CONTRACTOR HIRING ONLY LATER TO DISCOVER THAT THERE WAS DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM. THAT THEY COULDN'T FIND WHEN THEY SEARCH A PARTICULAR NAME OR LIKENESS. ON THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HARMING THE CONTRACTOR TO EDUCATING UNEDUCATED PUBLIC AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRANSACTION THE VERY WHITE WERE ARGUABLY THE NEED THE MOST FOR- I THINK IT'S A START OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH IF A CONTRACTOR. THOUGHT THE OF BEING DISCIPLINE WHICH IF YOU KNOW THE PFLP TAKE LOT BECAUSE THEY NEGOTIATE AND BARGAIN LIKE A CRIMINAL COURT IF DISAPPOINTED ACTUALLY TAKEN THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT IT IT'S INDICATIVE ABOUT CONTRACTORS INTEGRITY ABILITY TO PERFORM THANK YOU.
