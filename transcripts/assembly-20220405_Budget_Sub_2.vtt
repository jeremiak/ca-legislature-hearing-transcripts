CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:35.152
HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:36.387
ENROLLMENT DECLINE SINCE THE

00:37:36.454 --> 00:37:38.255
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.791
THE AGENDA REALLY DOES A GOOD

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.226
JOB SUMMARIZING THOSE TRENDS.

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.095
ARE BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.062
FOR THE CURRENT YEAR SOME

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.464
DISTRICTS APPEAR TO BE

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.800
RECOVERING FROM LOST IN ROMAN.

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:53.738
BUT FEW IF ANY ARE ANYWHERE BACK

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.806
TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. SO

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:58.009
DESPITE OF WHAT'S WEAKENED ROMAN

00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:00.044
DEMAND RIGHT NOW BUT LEGISLATURE

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.580
STILL MIGHT WANT TO PROVIDE SOME

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:04.915
LEVEL OF GROWTH FUNDING. IN THE

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:05.950
BUDGET YEAR GIVEN THAT

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.385
ENROLLMENT POTENTIALLY COULD

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:09.954
START TO REBOUND NEXT YEAR NOW

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.188
EVEN IF THE ENTIRE AMOUNT

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:13.057
DESN'T END UP GETTING USED

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:16.260
EARNED BY DISTRICTS THAT MONEY

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.162
CAN STILL BE USED TO FUND

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.097
SHORTFALLS FUNDING SHORTFALLS IN

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:23.067
THE FORMULA. OR OTHER PURPOSES

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.169
AND SO IT'S REALLY A LOW RISK OF

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.004
LEGISLATURE PROVIDING SOME LEVEL

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.639
OF ROLLING GROWTH FUNDING FOR

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:29.707
THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT WAY

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:32.009
THAT MONEY CAN JUST BE USED IF

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:33.811
IT'S NOT EARNED FOR OTHER

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:37.448
PURPOSES. WITH REGARD TO THE

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:38.015
HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED FIFTY

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.484
MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME THAT

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:42.219
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.254
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.157
STRATEGIES- AS MISTER HANOVER

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:48.092
JUST NOTED THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.660
TWO BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED

00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:51.195
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:53.064
TIME FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. NOW

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:56.333
WHEN THAT MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.302
WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COLLEGES

00:38:58.369 --> 00:39:01.005
THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:03.574
ON HOW MUCH THEY SPENT HOW MUCH

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:06.243
THEY HAVE LEFT OR EVEN WHAT THE

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.244
EFFECTIVENESS WERE OF THOSE

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.146
FUNDS AND SO THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:10.715
REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD IDEA

00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:14.218
AT THIS POINT. ABOUT- WHETHER

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:15.886
ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING REALLY

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.389
IS HAS MERIT TOWARDS A PROMISING

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:20.524
USE OF MONEY. IN ADDITION THERE

00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:23.094
ARE NUMBER OF SURVEYS THAT- THE

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.728
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:26.731
HAVE DONE- AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.032
THAT THE MAIN REASONS WHY

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.900
CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ENROLLING

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:30.968
IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNICORP WHICH

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.471

00:46:39.263 --> 00:46:41.031
AND COMMITTEE COLLEGES GET A

00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:42.065
CERTAIN PERCENT I THINK IT'S

00:46:42.132 --> 00:46:44.301
ABOUT 11% THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:45.903
GET AND SNATCHING. SO THE

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.971
QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT MONEY

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:49.840
GO OUT THEN TO THE COLLEGES AND

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:53.310
SO COLLEGES- WILL TELL YOU AT

00:46:53.377 --> 00:46:55.579
LEAST ADMINISTRATORS OF THEIR

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:56.914
THE PAPER PAPER FOR THAT MONEY

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.482
AND UNRESTRICTED WAY THROUGH

00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.384
PORTION IT'S WHICH IS THEIR

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:00.918
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:03.687
FORMULA. AND SO IF THE FORMULA

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:06.523
IS BASED IN LARGE PART ON

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:07.925
ENROLLMENT ENROLLMENT DECLINES

00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:08.825
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEE A

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:13.397
DECLINE IN THE UNRESTRICTED. OF

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:13.997
APPORTIONMENT MONEY THAT THEY

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:16.200
GET. THAT MONEY THEN. WOULD NEED

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:18.135
TO GO BACK INTO EITHER COMMUNITY

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.970
COLLEGES OR IF YOU MENDED

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.272
STATUTE K. TWELVE AND NOW MONEY

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.408
PRESUMABLY THEN WOULD GO INTO

00:47:24.474 --> 00:47:26.210
RESTRICTED- FOR RESTRICTED

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.579
PURPOSES SO. WHICH WHICH GIVES

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.447
THEM LESS CONTROL SO IT'S KIND

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.816
OF AN ISSUE FOR THE COLLEGES

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.418
ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY COMES TO

00:47:34.484 --> 00:47:35.986
THEM DOES IT COME TO THE MINUTE

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.421
UNRESTRICTED WAY WHERE THEY HAVE

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.855
A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.190
THEY USE THAT MONEY TOWARDS A

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:42.793
COME IN AND IN A IN A RESTRICTED

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:45.162
WAY WHERE THEY'RE TOLD EXACTLY

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:46.863
HOW THE MONEY COULD BE USED IN

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.565
THERE ARE WORRIED ABOUT A

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:49.866
MISALIGNMENT I GET ALL THAT BUT

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:51.802
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF. THE

00:47:51.868 --> 00:47:53.503
COMMUNICABLE JUST HAVING FEWER

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.539
STUDENTS AND ROLL SWEET HERE

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.474
CONCERNED- NO WE'RE WORRIED

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.742
ABOUT OUR BUDGET BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.711
DECLINING ENROLLMENT BUT YOU'RE

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:02.079
STILL GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:03.714
MONEY FROM THE STATE FOR

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.881
EDUCATING COMMITTEE CALL

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:05.949
STUDENTS YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.852
GETTING MORE MONEY PER STUDENT

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:09.820
YOU STILL GET THE SAME OUT OF

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:12.589
POCKETS HIGHER YOUR- FACULTY PAY

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.758
SALARIES PAY YOUR YOU KNOW PLAN

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:18.595
FEES AND MAINTENANCE AND- ENERGY

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:21.031
COSTS SO. WHY WHY THE BIG DEAL

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:24.001
FROM YOU KNOW DISTRICTS WHO ARE.

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.670
YOU KNOW FREAKING OUT I GUESS.

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:30.107
IF IT'S NOT EQUAL IF. IF LET'S

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:31.842
SAY THERE'S HUNDRED COMMITTEE

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.644
CALL DISTRICTS AND IT'S A

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:34.978
HUNDRED AND TEN OR SOMETHING

00:48:35.045 --> 00:48:36.813
THAT LET'S SAY LIKE A HUNDRED OF

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.648
THEM HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.516
THERE DIRT DECREASING BY 5%

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.385
EVERY YEAR AND THEN. THE OTHER

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:43.287
TENER DECREASING BY 20% SO

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:44.655
THEY'RE OUT LIARS THAT THEY

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:46.623
WOULD HAVE BUT IF EVERYTHING'S

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.027
BASICALLY SOMEWHAT IN THE RANGE

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.495
OF EVERYBODY'S FALLING. IN A

00:48:51.561 --> 00:48:53.363
SIMILAR MANNER. I DON'T

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.832
UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHY WHY THE

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:58.068
CONCERN. SO YOU'RE RIGHT THE

00:48:58.135 --> 00:48:59.770
MONEY PER STUDENT WOULD STAY THE

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:02.472
SAME IN THAT CASE OVERALL IS

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.441
SIMIEN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:05.842
STATUS LEVEL COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:09.246
GOT THEIR 11% BUT IF THE FORMULA

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.414
WHERE TO STAY THE SAME THE

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.183
APPORTIONMENT. FORMULA WHERE TO

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.085
STAY THE SAME AS IT IS NOW.

00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:16.787
FUNDING PER STUDENT YOU KNOW HOW

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.954
MUCH THEY GET PER STUDENT HOW

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.823
MUCH THEY GET PER IN ROMAN R.

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.591
FOR OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE TO STAY

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.893
THE SAME THAT LEVEL WOULD DROP

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:24.961
SO THEY'RE THEY'RE UNRESTRICTED

00:49:25.028 --> 00:49:25.862
MONEY THEIR PORTION OF MONEY

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:28.565
WOULD DROP. AND THEY WOULD THEN

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:31.001
GET MONEY. TO THEM ON A

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.102
RESTRICTED BASIS AND THAT WOULD

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.905
BE. AS THEY WOULD SEE A LIMITING

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:35.872
SO YOU'RE RIGHT OVERALL THE

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.074
FUNDING PER STUDENT WOULD SAY

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.076
THE SAME. BUT COLLEGES ARE ALSO

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:40.744
THINKING ABOUT WILL HOW MUCH.

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.412
ABILITY HOW MUCH FLEXIBILITY DO

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.081
I HAVE OVER THAT MONEY BECAUSE

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.982
IF IT COMES BACK JUST IN THE

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:46.983
FORM OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE I'M

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.385
SURE THEY WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:49.853
BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY BUT WE

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.088
STILL HAVE SALARIES TO PAY WE

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:52.956
STILL HAVE PENSION OBLIGATIONS

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.392
TO MEET WE STILL HAVE OTHER

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:58.628
OPERATING COSTS. GOTCHA AND THEN

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.697
FOR MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:02.733
ON THIS- FORMER CHANCELLORS

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:06.903
OFFICE THAT- FORGET YOUR LAST

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:13.377
NAME. AT THE AT EXACTLY- WHAT'S

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:16.546
ON WHAT IT FROM DO YOU HAVE AS

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.348
FAR AS THAT GOES ON INTENT RIGHT

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:19.816
SO THE THEIR INVOLVEMENT

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:22.552
DECLINES OUR- I'M SURE THAT'S

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.121
DIFFERENT BUT IS THERE ARE AS

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:27.324
OUR A RAFFLE RANGER IS IT

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.593
ROUGHLY IN THE SAME- PERCENTAGE

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:30.894
WHAT CAN YOU LINE IS HERE. WITH

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.662
YEAH I HAVE SHARE A LITTLE BIT

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:35.499
MORE ABOUT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.768
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT- THERE

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:39.169
HAVE BEEN ENROLLMENT DECLINES

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:40.837
ACROSS ALL SEVENTY THREE

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.506
DISTRICTS AND A HUNDRED SIXTEEN

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:46.176
COLLEGES- THERE. AND MORE ON

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:48.044
EVEN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:51.448
STATE- WE'VE SEEN DROPS IN THE

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:54.451
FAR NORTH. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.086
DROPS AND SOME OF IT- THE MORE

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:58.054
EXPENSIVE AREAS TO LIVE I THINK

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.357
PART OF- THOSE KIND OF ECONOMIC

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.925
CHALLENGES THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:04.428
FACING. WE DO SHOW SOME

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.530
DISTRICTS ABOUT FIVE THAT ARE

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:09.566
STARTING TO- RE ENROLL STUDENTS

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:11.034
WHO WERE SEEING THEIR STRATEGIES

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.969
PAYING OFF AS SOME OF THEIR

00:51:13.036 --> 00:51:14.171
INVESTMENT OF THEIR FEDERAL

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.440
STIMULUS FUNDS. IN COMBINATION

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.708
WITH THE STATE INVESTMENTS WE

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.444
ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.546
OF THE PANDEMIC WE LOST A LOT OF

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.448
MALE STUDENTS PARTICULARLY BLACK

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:26.616
AND- AND NATIVE AMERICAN

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.218
STUDENTS SO THEY'RE A LOT IT

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:32.088
TARGETED EFFORTS NOW. TO BRING

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.157
BACK THOSE STUDENTS- ANOTHER KEY

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.525
STRATEGY THAT'S REALLY BEEN

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:37.060
EFFECTIVE HAS BEEN DISMISSING

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.196
FEES SOMETHING THAT COLLEGES

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:42.098
HAVE DONE THROUGH THE FEDERAL.

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:45.402
DOLLARS THAT THEY RECEIVED. I

00:51:45.469 --> 00:51:47.938
GUESS WHAT I ASKED IF WE HAVE A

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:49.906
TO DO YOU HAVE LIKE A RANGE AS

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:52.309
FAR AS AB YOU KNOW RAPPERS ARE

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:54.978
IS YET ONE THAT'S AT 25% ONE

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.714
THAT THREE OR ITS IT'S- ARE

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.716
THEY- DO WE HAVE LIKE 90% ARE

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:01.518
ROUGHLY. BETWEEN ONE NUMBER

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:03.720
OTHER NUMBER YEAH I CAN ALSO GET

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.155
IT WE HAVE A MEMO THAT SHOWS

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.290
THAT NOT- I'LL BE. SURE TO

00:52:07.357 --> 00:52:08.892
PROVIDE IT TO YOU SHORTLY AFTER

00:52:08.959 --> 00:52:09.960
THIS BUT THE RANGE RIGHT NOW

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:12.028
THAT WE'RE SEEING. IS ANYWHERE

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:14.998
FROM AN EIGHT TO A 28% GOTCHA.

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.833
AND HOW MANY ARE IN THAT HIGHER

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:18.835
AND TO ROUGHLY. MOST ELEVEN THE

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:21.872
MEDIAN- RANGE AROUND TWELVE TO

00:52:21.938 --> 00:52:24.040
FIFTEEN- ACROSS OUR COLLEGES

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.509
WHERE YOU ARE SEEING THOSE

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:27.310
LARGER ONES AGAIN I MENTIONED.

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.045
MANY OF THEM WERE IN AREAS THAT

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.747
WERE ALREADY SEEING LARGE

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.716
POPULATION DECLINES EVEN PRE

00:52:32.782 --> 00:52:34.217
PANDEMIC. AND THIS JUST

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:36.052
EXACERBATED THAT WERE PEOPLE

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.588
MOVING OUT FOR COST OF LIVING OR

00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:41.224
OTHER. ISSUES SUCH AND THEN I

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.793
KNOW THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR-

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:49.332
CHAIR TEAM. ON THE- IN PERSON.

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:50.800
R. HE I MIGHT. THE COMMITTEE

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:53.103
COLLEGES ARE WHICH ARE THE LAST

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.706
SEGMENT TO GO. FULLY IN PERSON-

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.942
BUT IS THAT A FACTOR IS HAVING

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:03.613
MORE. ONLINE ESSENTIALLY-

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.917
PROVIDING. A REASON FOR PEOPLE

00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:09.486
TO ENROLL MORE HAS MORE THAN

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:12.122
AROUND YOU KNOW 40% OF OUR

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:14.858
STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE OUR OVER

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:16.326
TWENTY FIVE WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.827
THE GROUND IS THAT WHEN A

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:20.030
COLLEGE OR DISTRICT PUTS THEIR

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:22.899
COURSE SCHEDULE ON UP AT THE

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:25.068
BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER MANY

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:27.003
OF THEM SEE THEIR ONLINE CLASSES

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.573
FILL UP FIRST AND THEN- ARE

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.341
HAVING TO CONVERT IN PERSON

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:33.910
CLASSES ONLINE OR A HYBRID

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:37.614
MODALITY SO. RIGHT NOW- AROUND

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.683
60% OF COURSES ARE BEING OFFERED

00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:42.118
IN PERSON OR AT LEAST STARTING

00:53:42.185 --> 00:53:43.720
AS IN PERSON AND THEN

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:44.921
TRANSITIONING ONCE THEY SEE

00:53:44.988 --> 00:53:46.890
STUDENT DEMAND WE SEE THAT ALSO

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.758
REFLECTED IN ERY SURVEYS THAT

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:50.527
WE'VE HAD OF STUDENTS WHERE

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.728
THEY'VE LEARNED THAT THEY LIKE

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.396
THE FLEXIBILITY IT WORKS FOR

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:55.999
CERTAIN CLASSES. ARE CAREER AND

00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:59.035
CLASSES HAVE BEEN PREDOMINATELY-

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:02.138
IN PERSON SINCE THE START OF THE

00:54:02.205 --> 00:54:02.739

00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.308
SHOWS ME **** IF I'M READING

00:54:38.375 --> 00:54:39.943
THIS CORRECTLY. BUT SHOWS THAT

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.045
IN THE FALL OF TWENTY NINETEEN

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.380
WE'RE TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:46.149
ONLINE. AND NOW WE HAVE

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:48.685
PROBABLY- LOOKS LIKE UNDER A

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:50.387
HUNDRED THOUSAND ONLINE IS THAT

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.287
ACCURATE. YEAH AND THIS IS

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:53.790
ACTUALLY BASED ON OUR THIS IS A

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.992
BASED ON A SURVEY OF SIXTY EIGHT

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:59.162
DISTRICTS SO DOESN'T INCLUDE-

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:01.898
ALL REPORTING BUT WHAT WE ARE

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.200
SEEING IS THAT THERE IS YOU SEE

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:08.304
THAT- THAT COMPLETE SHIFT- AND

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:11.741
SO YOU ALSO I KNOW- THAT THESE

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:15.111
ARE FROM FALL- TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.980
SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE WHAT

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:19.215
WILL HAPPEN IN SPRING- HIM WE'LL

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:21.217
SEE MORE IN PERSON COME THIS

00:55:21.284 --> 00:55:23.887
SPRING- BUT AS I MENTIONED

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:26.556
EARLIER OUR DEMAND IS STILL.

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.924
CONTINUING TO BE HIGHER FOR

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:30.894
ONLINE OR HYBRID CLASSES WILL

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.529
NOTE THAT FACULTY ARE ALSO

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:34.931
EXPLORING A NEW MODALITY THAT-

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.200
MANY OF THEM FIND A VERY

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.235
EFFECTIVE CALLED HIGH FLEX WHEN

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:42.572
THEY CAN BOTH IN PERSON- AND

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:46.109
ONLINE IN A VERY INTERACTIVE.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:50.780
MODE SO- IF I'M CORRECT THE DATA

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:53.316
SHOWS THAT STUDENTS TYPICALLY

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:55.685
AREN'T AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:56.986
ONLINE EXPERIENCES THEY ARE AND

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:59.756
THEN CLASS- AS THEY ARE IN THE

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:02.459
WITH THE IN CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:06.229
SO WHY SHOULD WE DO SOMETHING.

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.831
AND THIS MAY BE A QUESTION FOR

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:10.467
THE CHAIR LATER I DON'T KNOW WE

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:11.267
SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO ENSURE

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.203
THERE ARE MORE IN PERSON CLASSES

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:14.738
BECAUSE FOR SOME IT'S NOT JUST A

00:56:14.804 --> 00:56:16.673
MATTER OF CONVENIENCE I GET

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.741
THAT- STATES THEIR LIFE RIGHT

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:19.175
THEY'VE GOT JOBS ETCETERA BUT

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:21.444
FOR SOME THAT MAY NOT BE SO TRUE

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:21.978
IF THEY'RE NOT IF STUDENTS

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.646
AREN'T FINDING SUCCESS. IN THE

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.815
ONLINE EXPERIENCE OF THE UNITY

00:56:25.882 --> 00:56:28.852
CAREFUL ABOUT PROMOTING IT.

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:30.253
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION SO IS

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:33.690
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPEN. WE

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:36.159

WE'RE CALLING OUR TRANSITION

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:41.264
BACK ON HYBRID SPACE- NEXT MONTH

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:44.467
SO YOU GO BACK TO THE SO THE

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:45.201
OFFICE IS NOT OPEN TODAY. WELL

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:49.239
WE'VE BEEN WORKING- EVERY SINCE

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:50.840
THEN BUT WE GOT THIS IS A TO ME.

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.675
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN ASK

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:53.843
TEACHERS AND STUDENTS TO GO BACK

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.079
IN A CLASSROOM BUT NOT HALF

00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:56.880
ASKED PEOPLE TO GO INTO AN

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:58.681
OFFICE BUILDING GO TO WORK IN

00:56:58.748 --> 00:56:59.883
THIS NOT YOU NOT PUTTING THIS ON

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.885
YOU PERSONALLY. BUT IS JUST

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.553
CRAZY TO ME TO THINK THAT THE

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.021
CHANCES OFFICES OPEN FULLY OPEN

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:06.256

DAY AND RENEW MY CREDENTIAL

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:09.325
RIGHT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.794
THE PLATFORM THE COMPUTER

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.829
PLATFORM. I CALLED OVER. WELL I

00:57:12.896 --> 00:57:13.963

THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.735

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.036
THERE WAS AN EMAIL ADDRESSES I

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.038
DON'T WANT EMAIL ANYBODY. BUT

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.808
THE POINT IS- PEOPLE NEED TO GET

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.910
BACK IN THE OFFICE. SO THAT OUR

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.511
EDUCATION SYSTEM CAN FUNCTION

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.513

CHAIR. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.428

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:46.763
WHY PEOPLE CAN AS TEACHERS GO

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.064

REALLY THERE'S NO PLACE FOR

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.759
STUDENTS TANGIBLE- TO ARRIVE AT

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:53.929
IT. THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.065
PEOPLE WORKING THERE. AND SO IF

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.434
YOU FACULTY AND QUITE FRANKLY

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.135
THE OUTCOMES SEEM A LITTLE BIT

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.971
NEBULOUS AS WELL. YES IT'S

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.205
IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT WE'RE

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.273
STILL ACTUALLY QUITE EARLY IN

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.808
THE STAGE OF OUR SEVEN YEAR

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:07.376
START A PERIOD ABOUT HALFWAY

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.978
THROUGH AND SO WHILE WE HAVE

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:09.945
NINE FULL TIME FACULTY THIS YEAR

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:11.413
YOU'LL SEE HAS INCREASED BY

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.249
ABOUT 60% TO FIFTEEN FACULTY.

01:09:13.315 --> 01:09:14.717
AND THAT'S IN DIRECT RELATION TO

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:16.118
THE WAY THAT WE'RE GROWING OUR

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.686
PROGRAMS AND OUR ROLE IN IT BUT

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:19.121
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.789
OTHER PEOPLE TOUCH STUDENTS AT

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:22.725
OUR INSTITUTION WE HAVE FOLKS ON

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:23.292
THE FRONT LINE ENGAGED IN

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.060
STUDENT INTERACTIONS. THAT ARE

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.128
BEYOND OUR FACULTY STUDENT

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:27.630
SUPPORT SPECIALIST FOLKS WERE

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:28.731
SUPPORTING STUDENTS TECHNOLOGY

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:30.733
NEEDS AND IT IS A FULL HANDS ON

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.034
DECK EFFORT WITH EVERYTHING

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.302
FOCUSED ON THE STUDENT

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:34.803
EXPERIENCE. AS A WHILE OUR

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.572
STAFFING REFLECTS THAN WHAT WAS

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.940
NEEDED TO PUT IN THE STRUCTURE

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.775
AS AN INSTITUTION AT TO PREPARE

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.911
US FOR SCALING ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.280
AND WHAT WE WILL SEE NOW IS A

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.382
LOT MORE HIRING AND FOCUSED ON-

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.716
THOSE ARE ON THE FRONTLINES OF

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.251
THAT STUDENT SUPPORT AND STUDENT

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:51.186
TEACHING ASPECT OF THINGS. SO

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:51.887
GIVEN THAT YOU HAVE NINE

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:54.156
FACULTY. AND WHAT A THOUSAND

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:55.824
STUDENTS THAT WE NEED THAT MEANS

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:57.092
EACH FACULTY MEMBER HAS ONE

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.193
HUNDRED STUDENTS WELL AGAIN

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.762
THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF

01:09:59.828 --> 01:10:01.764
DIFFERENT- FOLKS CENTER CAMPUS

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.732
AND WHAT THIS PREPARES US TO DO

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:06.101
TO HAVE THE FULL TIME FACULTY

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:06.702
QUORUM PLACE IN THE STUDENTS

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:07.503
IMPORTANT PLACE IN THE

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.804
TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE. IS IT

01:10:08.871 --> 01:10:09.905
ALLOWS US TO DIAL UP AND SAID

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.675
ACT ASSIST TO PREPARE FOR THE

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.109
SCALE WE HAVE A VERY FOCUS

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.945
GROWTH PLAN THAT'S BEEN APPROVED

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.746
BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO GO

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.081
FROM. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:20.182
STUDENTS THAT WE HAD IN THE

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:21.483
SUMMER TO FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.385
BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:26.121
THREE SO IT IS NOT WITHOUT A AT

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:26.956
THE CORE SET OF PLANS AND

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.791
OBJECTIVES TO IT TO HOW IT

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:32.494
SCALES WE HAVE TO. BUT

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:33.362
EXPERIENCE IN THE IN. IN PLACE

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:35.130
BEFORE WE SEE. BECAUSE GROWTH

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:35.898
NOT JUST ABOUT. IT IS. ABOUT

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:37.166
ACT. REALLY BEING ABLE TO FOCUS

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:39.034
ON THE QUALITY OF WHAT WE'RE

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:40.903
DOING. AND OTHER STEPS I WILL

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:41.537
JUST MENTION LIKE ACCREDITATION

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:42.771
AND ALL THOSE THINGS. THOSE ARE

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:43.939
IMPORTANT STAT STAGES IN THE

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.207
COLLEGES DEVELOPMENT PRESS

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.309
PROCESS THAT. ALSO ALLOW US TO

01:10:47.376 --> 01:10:48.711
ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:49.845
THAT YOU LIKELY HAVE AROUND.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.113
WHAT IS OUR FUTURE REVENUE MODEL

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.881
LOOKS LIKE WHAT IT WHAT WE NEED

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:54.883
TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF. AT

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.519
GOING FORWARD HOW WE DECIDE AND

01:10:57.586 --> 01:10:59.588
DEVELOP A FUNDING MODEL. AT

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:00.489
ALWAYS CONTEMPLATED UNDER

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:03.125
LEGISLATION TO SCALE OUR ABILITY

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.393
TO COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:05.894
PROGRAM NOT JUST TECH HELP RIGHT

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.663
BUT ACROSS THE SYSTEM AS A

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.631
WHOLE. YOU KNOW WHAT I NOTICE

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:09.865
WITH CALVERT EVERY TIME THEY

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.867
COME UP HERE AND I DON'T I'MNOT

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:13.535
GONNA ASK YOU RESPOND TO THIS

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:14.837
COMMENT IS IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:15.971
HAPPEN. IS ALWAYS GOING TO

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.307
HAPPEN WE NEED MORE MONEY. WE

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:18.907
NEED MORE STAFF BECAUSE IT'S

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.342
GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT I'M NOT

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:21.910
SURE THAT IT'S HAPPENING. AND I

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.278
THINK THE DATA REFLECTS THAT ONE

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:24.847
THOUSAND. EIGHTY GRADUATES. FIVE

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.248
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:27.750
WITHDRAWALS. NOT DEFENSIBLE FROM

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.785
MY PERSPECTIVE. ESPECIALLY WITH

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.387
THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:32.721
THAT'S GOING INTO THIS PROGRAM

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:34.890
AS A STUDENT MONEY. MONEY MEANT

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.258
FOR STUDENTS. AND IT LOOKS TO

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:37.893
ME. LIKE IT'S GOING TO HIRE

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.294
EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE OF THE

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:41.163
CLASSROOM OR EVEN THE VIRTUAL

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.498
CLASSROOM. THANK IS A REAL ISSUE

01:11:42.564 --> 01:11:45.067
HERE- STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.335
AND ALL THESE FOLKS I KNOW

01:11:46.402 --> 01:11:48.270
YOU'VE MADE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.838
NEED THEM WE NEED THEM. BUT

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.740
EVERY TIME. CALVET HERE WE NEED

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.409
THIS WE NEED THIS AND IT'S GONNA

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:54.843
HAPPEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I JUST

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.612
DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING TODAY. I

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.780
THINK MISTER CHAIR WE NEED TO

01:11:57.846 --> 01:12:00.215
END THIS EXPERIMENT. I KNOW IT

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.384
WAS WELL INTENTIONED. BUT I

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.653
THINK- IF THERE IS SUCH A

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.522
PROGRAM THAT SHOULD EXIST IT

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.691
SHOULD EXIST. UNDER AN EXISTING-

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:09.858
COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT TO ME IS

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.860
THE NO BRAINER AGAIN WE'RE

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:12.928
TRYING TO RECREATE THE WHEEL. OR

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.363
EVEN PERFECT WE'LL ONE ALREADY

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.265
EXISTS. I DOWN THE ROAD HERE IN

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:20.703
SACRAMENTO- SO- I. I'M NOT

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.304
CONVINCED TODAY I APPRECIATE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:25.007
WHAT YOU'RE DOING- BUT I'M JUST

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:27.509
NOT CONVINCED TODAY THAT THIS IS

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:32.081
A PATH WE SHOULD KEEP GOING DOWN

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.449
. IT'S TIME TO END THIS. BERMAN

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:37.886
BACK TO YOU. CHAIR YEAH YOU- I

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.188
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WILL

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.056
BE TO MISTER MEDINA. SO I

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:42.658
REALIZE WE HAVE ONGOING MONEY

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.760
AND ONE TIME WHEN THERE'S THIS

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.762
IS A BUNCH OF THE ONE TIME STILL

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.897
THERE. AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE A

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:50.866
LOT OF MONEY ON GOING FOR THAT

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.935
HE PEOPLE SO IT'S I GUESS LIKE

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.336
TWO HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:54.970
DOLLARS PER EMPLOYEE BUT MAYBE

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.538
IT'S YOUR START UP IN LOCAL

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.974
CHANGE. BUT I GUESS THE BIGGEST

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:04.179
ISSUE. THAT I WANT TO RAISE IS

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:06.548
WHEN THIS WAS CREATED. BEFORE

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.317
YOU WERE AROUND HAS NOTHING TO

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.252
DO WITH YOU YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THE

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.421
MOST COMPETENT PERSON IN THIS

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.656
ENTITY HERE THAT WE'VE SEEN. BUT

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.959
IT HAS ZERO TO DO WITH YOU IT'S

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:19.194
ABOUT THIS MISSION TAXPAYERS A

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:21.897
CALIFORNIA AND WHAT ELSE WE DO

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.432
SO WHEN THIS IDEA WAS PROPOSED I

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:26.502
THINK FOUR YEARS AGO. TWENTY TWO

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.069
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BEFORE THE

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:29.872
PANDEMIC IT WAS A DIFFERENT

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:31.473
WORLD. AND WE JUST HAD. ISSUE

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:35.077
NUMBER ONE THEY CAN'T COUNT

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:36.178
COLLEGES TALK ABOUT HOW

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.714
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE BECOMING

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:41.283
MORE AND MORE ONLINE. AND THIS

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.751
IS THAT WAS THE REASON WHY THIS

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:44.686
WAS CREATED BECAUSE THERE WASN'T

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:47.256
A LOT OF ONLINE STUFF AND MISS

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.491
NAVARETTE JUST ARTICULATE THIS

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:52.628
IS THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.629
COLLEGES STUDENTS ARE VOTING

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.464
WITH THEIR FEET. THEIR FINGERS

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.366
THEIR IPHONE OR THEIR COMPUTER

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.334
TO SIGN UP WHEN THEY GO ON A

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.037
ROLL. THEY PRIORITIZE ONLINE AND

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.572
I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE BUSY

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:06.074
COMMITTEE COSTUMES ARE OLDER.

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:07.509
AND JOBS ARE FAMILIES ARE LESS

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.912
FLEXIBLE AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SO

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:10.946
THEY'RE DOING THIS ONLINE STEPS

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.981
IF WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TEN

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.817
COLLEGES WHO ARE THRIVING AND

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.685
THEIR FACULTY ARE LEARNING HOW

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:19.988
TO DO. ZOOM EDUCATION NOW WHY DO

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:22.391
WE NEED THIS EXPERIMENT IT SEEMS

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:24.726
THAT IT WAS EXPERIMENTS AND IT'S

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:26.595
NOT WORKING AND I CONCUR THAT.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.330

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.336
THIS BODY- AND THEN THE SECOND

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.405
PIECE. IS THAT WHEN THIS WAS

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:39.141
PROPOSED TO US THE NOTION WAS

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.176
WE'RE GOING AFTER THE STRANDED.

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:42.878
STRANDED CALIPHS IT'S- THE

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.180
PEOPLE WHO ARE AN ALTERNATE

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.950

HAVE ACCESS SO THEY NEED THIS

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:57.759
ONE WE JUST WE HAVE THAT THAT

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:59.328
EARLIER CUNY COLLEGES ARE NOW

DOING. MORE THAN HALF OF THE

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:03.765
STUFF ONLINE. BUT ALSO THE

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:05.868
NOTION WAS YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:07.569
FOCUS ON PEOPLE. WITH LIMITED

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:10.239
EDUCATION BACKGROUND AND I THINK

01:15:10.305 --> 01:15:11.440
THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.108
THINK THOSE PEOPLE NEED A

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.810
COLLEGE TO GO TO EXISTENCE WE

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:17.079

TO SUPPORT I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:32.227
TO THAT ONLINE BUT IT'S NOT THE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.495
SAME HYBRID WE AT IN PERSON. BUT

01:15:33.562 --> 01:15:35.330
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE 33% OF

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:36.431
YOUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:38.500
BACHELOR'S DEGREES SO OF YOUR-

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:40.369
SO CALLED A THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:42.404
HERE AT OF COMPLETED. THAT'S THE

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:43.739
POPULATION THAT WE WEREN'T

SUPPOSED TO FOCUS ON YOU'RE

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:47.142
SUPPOSED TO FOCUS 1100% ON

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.610
PEOPLE. WITHOUT BACHELOR'S

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.846
DEGREES WITHOUT ANY COLLEGE THAT

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:52.881
WAS WHAT YOU SOLD US WITH. FOUR

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:55.050
YEARS AGO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:56.885
GO OUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE.

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:58.287
BARELY A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE OR

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.188
DROP OUT TRYING TO GET BACK IN

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.757
THE COLLEGE GAME WHO WHO NEEDED

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:03.625
SKILLS TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.627
AND SELL. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.529
THERE'S THIS SCOPE SHAFT. AND

01:16:07.596 --> 01:16:08.764
THAT YOU KNOW WE CHANGED

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.265
DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FOUR

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:12.968
YEARS THIS PANDEMIC HAS HAS MADE

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:16.271
THINGS. VERY VERY VERY DIFFERENT

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:21.944
SO. CHAMBER GALGIANI YEAH LESS

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.812
THAN YES I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.380
RESPONSE IT WOULDN'T IN THE FORM

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.482
OF A QUESTION SO I WANTED TO

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:29.451
MAKE SURE THERE'S A LOT OF THEIR

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.018
INTERVAL WITH ME RESPONDING

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.853
NUMBER OPEN I'D LIKE TO UNPACK A

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.355
COUPLE THINGS IF YOU'LL LET ME

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.790
THAT THE FIRST THING IS REALLY

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:35.791
AND THIS QUESTION AROUND THE AND

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.693
THAT 30% OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.394
COME TO US WITH BATCHES DEGREES

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:40.762
IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE THAT

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.431
WERE UNPACKING RIGHT NOW AT

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:43.265
LARGELY BECAUSE MOST OF THE

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.133
STUDENTS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CRM

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.735
PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE BILL CAME TO

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.370
US FROM THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.638
SYSTEM WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE-

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.974
FACING AT POINT IN TIME ECONOMIC

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.442
DISLOCATION. AND SOMETHING IS

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.177
TRYING THEM TO OPEN ACCESS

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.378
INSTITUTIONS AND WE ACTUALLY

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.980
SURVEY OUR STUDENTS AND WE YOU

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.815
KNOW OUR OUR AGE DEMOGRAPHIC IS

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:01.917
HIGHER IN TERMS OF THE AVERAGE

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:03.418
AGE OF STUDENT THAN REGULAR THAT

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.754
THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS AND

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.656
BUT WHEN WE SURVEY THEM 90% OF

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:08.757
THEM TALK ABOUT OUR FLEXIBLE

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:09.891
MOBILE AND THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY

01:17:09.958 --> 01:17:11.159
JUST ABOUT BEING ONLINE THAT IS

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.761
ACTUALLY ABOUT BEING A SKILLS

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.363
BASED COMPETENCY BASED MODEL-

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.965
THAT'S DESIGNED AROUND AT THE

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:18.734
LEARNER'S NEEDS AN ASYNCHRONOUS

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.469
NOT TIED TO THE ACADEMIC

01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:23.205
CALENDAR AT. AS RESTRICTIVE IN

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.840
NATURE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:27.743
HAS FALLEN OUT OF OUR THIS IS.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.144
JUST CALVET. COLLEGE THIS IS

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:31.213
COMMUNITY. A THE- IT IS THIS

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.147
POP. OF LEARNERS. SO WE ARE

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:34.082
ABSOLUTELY FOCUSED ON-

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.350
ESPECIALLY NON DEGREED

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:36.551
INDIVIDUALS BUT WE'RE ALSO

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.186
UNPACKING. WHAT IS HAPPENED IN

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.388
THE COURSE OF SOMEONE'S LIFE

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.889
THAT THEY'RE SUFFERING FROM.

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:44.059
UNEMPLOYMENT EVEN WITH A DEGREE.

01:17:44.126 --> 01:17:46.895
AND IT WASN'T AT THE HIGHER

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.964
LEVEL HM A CRACK AT THAT THEY'RE

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:50.432
COMING TO US FOR. RESKILLING

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:51.800
OPPORTUNITIES AND SOME OF THOSE

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.202
THINGS AND- I THINK THE MOST

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.204
IMPORTANT THING TO ME FOR. THIS

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:57.439
BODY TO CONSIDER AND TO

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.007
UNDERSTAND AS- WE DON'T SEE

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.142
OURSELVES AS SEPARATE AND APART

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.143
FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:02.811
SYSTEM. WE ARE DEFINITELY A PART

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.679
OF IT AND WE'RE A KEEP IMPORTANT

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.581
FEATURE IN THAT LANDSCAPE

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:07.416
BECAUSE- EVERYTHING THAT WE

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.151
LEARN AND CAN CONTRIBUTE. CAN BE

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.185
SHARED ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:11.753
THIS IS NOT A POPULATION FRANKLY

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.488
THAT WE'RE DOING WELL WITH THAT

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.123
AGAIN THAT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.258
THAT'S AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:17.859
RIGHT NOW. YEAH SO LET'S GO HE

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.327
WENT ON PASSING THINGS HOW ABOUT

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.530
THAT THE- ISSUE I THINK IS THE

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.031
OVERWHELMING ONE IS WHEN WE-

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.500
STARTED THIS. THIS PROPOSAL FOUR

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:27.269
YEARS AGO. THE COMMUNITY

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.571
COLLEGES VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THIS

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:34.476
AND THE FACULTY THE- OPPOSES NOW

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.777
I REALIZE YOU HAVE. NO A DOZEN

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:38.013
SO PEOPLE THAT MAY HAVE A UNION

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.548
CONTRACT YOU KNOW THE LINES HAD.

01:18:39.614 --> 01:18:40.816
CONCERN AND ALL THE THINGS IS

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.818
THAT IS HEY WE CAN DO THIS AND

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.186
ARGUMENT FROM CALIBRATORS WELL

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.654
YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT YOU DON'T DO

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.022
THIS YOU'RE NOT THAT'S NOT YOUR

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:48.356
MISSION YOU'RE NOT ONLINE. AND

01:18:48.423 --> 01:18:51.026
WE SAID HEY WE SHOULD HAVE A FEW

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:51.660
COMMUNITY COLLEGES GIVE THEM.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:53.395
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW THEIR ONLINE

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.063
PRESENCE WHY REINVENT THE WHEEL.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.432
WELL NOW WE HAVE ALL THIS ONLINE

01:18:57.499 --> 01:18:59.234
BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC SO IS

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:01.470
THIS A BIT OF DUPLICATION. OF A

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:03.271
HUNDRED AND TEN COLLEGES THAT DO

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:06.408
THIS. VERY WELL AND I I'D ARGUE-

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.843
YOU KNOW. THEY'VE THEY'VE

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:09.411
FIGURED OUT BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:10.345
AROUND FOR AWHILE AND SO. YOU

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:12.681
KNOW WE'RE PUMPING YOU KNOW-

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.883
GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD TO THIS SO.

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:17.052
WHY WOULD WE CONTINUE WITH THIS

01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:19.754
EXPERIMENT WE HAVE OVER HERE A

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.823
BUNCH OF COLLEGES A HUNDRED THE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:25.293
NOW DO ONLINE. VERY WELL. THIS

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.828
IS ACTUALLY NOT A POPULATION

01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:28.263
THAT WE'RE DOING WELL WITH. THE

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:30.432
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION FREE.

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:32.968
CERTIFICATION ACROSS OUR HIRED

01:19:33.034 --> 01:19:34.035
INSTANCE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:35.804
WE SEE VERY LOW RATES OF

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.205
COMPLETION OVER A THREE YEAR

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:38.773
PERIOD WITH THIS POPULATION OF

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.075
LEARNERS SO IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.977
BEING ONLINE BUT IT IS ACTUALLY

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.445
ABOUT HAVING A MODEL. THAT

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:46.581
ALLOWS US TO- STRUCTURE AROUND

01:19:46.648 --> 01:19:47.849
THE NEEDS OF THE LEARNERS AND

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.351
THAT IS AGAIN ASYNCHRONOUS NOT

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.119
TIED TO THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.787
NOT JUST ONLINE BUT SKILLS BASED

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.189
BASED ON THE MASTERY OF SKILLS.

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:56.458
OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.626
DOING WELL WITH COMPLETION OVER

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:00.362
THERE. BUT WE'VE DONE A COUPLE

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:01.029
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.532
EXPERIMENT. AND YOU. HAVE TO

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.901
BIRD EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:08.069
COME YEAH. SO HOW COULD YOU

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.538
CRITICIZE THE SYSTEM WHEN READ A

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.706
GREAT FAILURE. FROM YOU ALL WITH

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.475
COMPLETING PEOPLE YEAH AND IT'S

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:14.910
NOT EXACTLY A CRITICISM OF THE

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.945
SYSTEM IS THE REALITY THAT THOSE

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.747
SYSTEMS ARE NOT REALLY BUILT.

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:19.347
LIKELY NOT GOING OUT YES

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:21.816
ABSOLUTELY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:23.952
SUCCEEDED. THE EIGHTY. EIGHTY

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.087
PEOPLE ROUGHLY IN THIS ROOM AND

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.623
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. YES SELL SELL

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:30.892
THOSE ARE NOT ROUTINELY AND WE-

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:32.861
CERTAINLY DO NOT RISK WE RE AT

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:39.534
SATISFIED WITH MISLEADING. WE

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:40.869
FOCUS ON. CYNICAL AND THEN. IN

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:43.572
THAT. THAT YOU CAN AFFECTS.

01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:44.773
SUCCESS SO WE REALIZE WHEN WE

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.007
LOOK AT THE IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:48.443
AND- AT THE COLLEGE IS THAT WE

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.644
GET STUDENTS. AND ON THE RIGHT

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.880
TRACK SO WHEN YOU KNOW JUST EVEN

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.315
LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENTS THAT

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:54.382
WE'VE MADE OVER THE PAST FEW

01:20:54.449 --> 01:20:56.585
MONTHS. YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AGO

01:20:56.651 --> 01:20:58.620
80% OF OUR STUDENTS HAD MADE

01:20:58.687 --> 01:20:59.955
SOME SORT OF SATISFACTORY

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.590
ACADEMIC PROGRESS IN THE COURSE

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:03.058
OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. IN

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:04.159
JUST THIS PERIOD WITH

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:05.694
IMPROVEMENTS WITH INTERVENTION

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.262
WITH EFFORT AND WITH ENGAGEMENT

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.597
WITH OUR STUDENTS WE'VE SEEN

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.131
THAT SHORTENED BY TWO MONTHS AND

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:11.900
SO WE KNOW WE'RE ON THE RIGHT

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.835
TRACK AND WE KNOW THAT. A LOT OF

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:14.869
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE COMING

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:16.571
INTO OUR INSTITUTION NOW WILL

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:18.240
RECEIVE THAT IMPROVED VERSION OF

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:19.140
THE EXPERIENCE. THAT WILL

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.308
CONDITION THEIR SUCCESS WE'LL

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.143
SEE AN UPTICK IN COMPLETIONS

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.980
OVER A PERIOD OF- THE COMING

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.948
SUMMER FALL EXCEPT TRACK. AT

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:29.251
WHEN THE FLOW OF THE STUDENTS AT

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:30.018
THAT TIME TO COMPETE THEIR

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.620
COMPLETE THEIR PROGRAMS. SO DO

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.221
YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:34.589
THAT WE'VE SPENT ROUGHLY ONE

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:38.159
POINT FIVE. MILLION DOLLARS. PER

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.596
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOT A

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:42.364
CERTIFICATE. THAT CALIFORNIA FOR

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.065
WEEKS GIVEN- OVER HOW MILLION

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:47.235
DOLLARS. ON GOING AND WHAT TIME

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.237
TO RIGHT. WE HAVE EIGHTY PEOPLE

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:51.573
WITH A CERTIFICATE AND- WE DON'T

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.210
KNOW HOW MOST PEOPLE HAD DEGREES

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.344
IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. WE WOULD

01:21:56.411 --> 01:21:58.480
JUST NOT GOOD INVEST FOR YOU. I

01:21:58.546 --> 01:21:59.714
THINK IT'S A CRITICAL I'VE KNOWN

01:21:59.781 --> 01:22:00.915
PER PERSON I THINK IT'S A

01:22:00.982 --> 01:22:03.084
CRITICAL INVESTMENT TO OF FOR US

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.287
TO MAKE OVER THE- YEARS THAT ARE

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:06.388
DONE. WHEN YOU PUT ONE POINT

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:08.490
FIVE MILLION. PER GRADUATE AT

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.858
YEAH I ABSOLUTELY WOULD BECAUSE

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.526
WE HAVEN'T EXPENDED DOWN THAT

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.961
THE FULL SCOPE OF THAT RESEARCH

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:13.995
HAS BEEN QUITE JUDICIOUS WITH

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:14.963
THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.365
WE'RE FOCUSED ON ENHANCING

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.834
QUALITY SPENT. A LITTLE OVER A

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:21.603
HUNDRED MILLION SO FAR. AT WITH

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:23.305
THREE YEARS OF ONGOING PLUS THE

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.807
ONE TIME. TWICE WE HAVE NOT

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:28.343
EXPENDED ALL OF THAT DOWN BUT

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.178
BUT YES TO PUT INTO PLACE TO

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:30.679
START OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.247
ABSOLUTELY THAT CAN SCALE AND

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:33.748
THEN OVER TIME AS YOU I THINK

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.483
EARLIER POINTED OUT WE WILL DO

01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:36.985
THE MATH HERE WELCOME BACK BUT

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:38.920
I'M I'M- PRETTY SURE IT'S

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.057
ROUGHLY. ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:22:42.123 --> 01:22:44.459
FOR NORTH OF ONE WELL NORTH OF

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:46.227
ONE MILLION DOLLARS PER

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:56.938
GRADUATE- HELLO MR MEDINA WILL

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.840
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:06.848
AUDIT THAT HE'S PARTICIPATED IN. CERTI MORE TWO MORE ISSUES ON

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:08.817
SHOULD THE JUMP INTO THAT WE

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:15.757
TALK ABOUT HERE IN THE AGENDA-

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.459
WHY DO YOU THINK THERE BEEN SO

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:20.829
FEW. STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.597
THEIR SHORT TERM PROGRAMS.

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.499
THAT'S ONE THING YOU FOCUS ON IS

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:25.967
FLEXIBILITY AND I GET A CLAIM

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:27.135
CAL BRIGHT LIKE FOR PROFIT

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.138
COLLEGES HAVE EASIER ENTRY. THE

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:32.006
BEARS EVENTUALLY ARE DIFFERENT

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.708
THAN ROLLING ONCE OR TWICE A

01:23:33.775 --> 01:23:35.176
YEAR LIKE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:36.811
ARE. SO FOR THE SHORT TERM

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:39.180
PROGRAMS WHY DO WE HAVE SO FEW

01:23:39.247 --> 01:23:40.949
STUDENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED.

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.784
IT'S A IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.053
WE LOOK AT IT VERY CLOSELY

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:45.587
BECAUSE RIGHT SAID ACUTE

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:46.921
INSTITUTIONAL PRIORITY FOR US.

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:49.057
AND WHAT WE FIND IS THAT WHEN

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:50.692
WE'RE ABLE TO REACH STUDENTS AND

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:53.027
INTERACT WITH STUDENTS WE SEE

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.562
THE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:56.231
MAKE IN THOSE INTERVENTIONS.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.132
THING TO SUPPORT THEM THROUGH

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.533
WHAT IS USUALLY A VERY

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.834
CHALLENGING TIME IN THEIR LIFE

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.603
WITH A LOT OF COMPETING

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:02.670
PRIORITIES AT THE SAME TIME WE

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:05.440
BALANCE THE NEED THAT WE HAVE TO

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.441
DEMONSTRATE COMPLETIONS WITH THE

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:08.209
GRACE THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:08.943
STUDENTS IN THE REALITIES THAT

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:10.412
THAT THEY'RE- FACING. AT THAT

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.514
DRAWS THEM TO A SELF PACED KIND

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.882
OF PROGRAM SO WE HAVE TO ALWAYS

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:14.949
BE ASKING OURSELVES ARE WE DOING

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.351
EVERYTHING INSTITUTIONALLY

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.986
POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:20.388
OUR STUDENTS THROUGHPUT- AND SO

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:21.222
WHEN WE SEE THOSE EARLY

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:22.757
INDICATORS OF SUCCESS AT THE

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.025
BEGINNING END OF THE PROCESS THE

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:25.827
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE'RE

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:26.494
DEVELOPING WITH OUR STUDENTS THE

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.129
WAY THAT OUR COUNSELORS AND OUR

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:29.063
STUDENTS SUPPORT SPECIALIST.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:29.864
INTERACT WITH OUR STUDENTS ON A

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.800
VERY REGULAR BASIS TO SUPPORT

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.735
AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE TIMES IN

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.136
WHICH THEY MEET NEED MORE TIME

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:38.373
OR TO BREAK- THOSE ARE THE WAYS

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.543
IN WHICH WE HAVE HAD IMPLEMENTED

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.177
A SERIES OF DIFFERENT SUPPORTS

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.612
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE. A YEAR AGO

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:46.815
SO YOU KNOW EVERY SIX MONTHS

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.082
EVERY DAY REALLY WE ARE

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.151
IMPROVING UPON WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:50.618
AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.454
IMPROVEMENTS AND- I THINK THAT'S

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.222
PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.424
THAT THE TIME THE TIME FRAMES IN

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:58.326
WHICH STUDENTS. ACHIEVE A BETTER

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.895
EXPERIENCE- AND THE WAY THEY

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:01.963
ENTER INSTITUTIONS DOESN'T

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.364
REFLECT WHAT WAS THERE SIX

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.899
MONTHS AGO IT REFLECTS AN

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:06.601
IMPROVED EXPERIENCE AND THAT'LL

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.469
CONTINUE THANK YOU. I'LL LET

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.137
MISTER MEDINA FOCUS ON THE THEIR

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:10.705
AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONE

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:12.474
LAST QUESTION HERE SO AS YOU

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.576
KNOW LAST YEAR THERE IS A BILL.

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:17.712
TO ELIMINATE- CALIBRATE WHICH IS

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:20.048
YOU KNOW STILL- TO THE SENATE

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:22.650
ABILITY. TO YOUR BILL CERVANTES

01:25:22.717 --> 01:25:25.320
AND THEN THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO-

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:26.988
NOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:32.760
BUDGET PUSH ZERO FINANCE- I. THE

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:34.662
BILLS YOU NAY. IN ASSEMBLY- I

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.498
ONLY MET ONE LAWMAKERS. CAL

RIGHT OUT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY SO

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:39.667
MAYBE HAVE OTHERS BUT I'VE SEEN

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:42.770
ONE- LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SAID

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.405
BERNIE GIVE YOU ONE MORE YEAR.

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.474
ESSENTIALLY TO US IS LIKE I

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:48.443
REALIZE YOU'RE ZERO FUNDING IT.

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.445
HOW MANY GIVEN ONE MORE YEAR. TO

01:25:50.512 --> 01:25:54.015
GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. AND SHOW

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:59.254
SUCCESS SO DO YOU THINK THAT YOU

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.688
. NOT YOU PERSONALLY SIGNED BY

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:03.458
YOU DO YOU THINK THIS ENTITY HAS

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.460
SHOWN SUCCESS IN ONE YEAR TO

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.061
PROVE ITS WORTHINESS BASED UPON

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:08.963
THE NUMBERS WE HAVE BEFORE US

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.331
TODAY I ABSOLUTELY DO AND

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.633
EXPLAIN WHY WITH EIGHTY

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.134
GRADUATES THAT THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:14.235
I ABSOLUTELY DO BECAUSE WE'RE

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:16.037
SOLVING A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.372
FOR A GROUP OF LEARNERS THAT

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:19.274
HASN'T BEEN SOLVED FOR IN THE

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:20.808
SYSTEM. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.176
ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF SOLVING

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:23.211
THOSE THINGS BOTH BECAUSE WE'RE

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.480
MEETING WITH ALL OF THE

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:26.114
EXPECTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SET

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.682
OUT FOR US BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.250
AT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THOSE

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.818
EARLY SIGNS OF SUCCESSES AND SO

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:32.921
THE FACT THAT WE NEED TIME TO

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:33.888
ACTUALLY BUILD MORE OUT FROM THE

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.290
INSTITUTION AS WAS ORIGINALLY

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:37.091
ENVISIONED IN THE LEGISLATION

01:26:37.158 --> 01:26:38.693
THAT KIND OF SEVEN YEAR TO START

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.827
OF TIME FRAME. I BELIEVE WE'RE

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:40.828
TRACKING TOWARDS AND WE'RE

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.096
WORKING VERY HARD TO HAVE A

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:44.132
GREAT TEAM IN PLACE COMING FROM

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:45.934
A WHOLE RANGE OF PUBLIC

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.236
NONPROFIT AND AT PRIVATE SECTOR

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.905
EXPERIENCES M. WE HAVE THE TEAM

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.173
IN PLACEI'VE BEEN FINALLY ABLE

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:53.675
TO PUT THE TEAM IN PLACE TO

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:55.143
CARRY THISWORK FORWARD AND

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:58.880
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING SO MUCH

01:26:58.947 --> 01:27:00.214
PROGRESS AND IN THE PAST SIX

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:01.816
MONTHS FOR EXAMPLE. I DON'T I

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.051
CAN'T SEE HOW YOU SAVE

01:27:03.117 --> 01:27:03.818
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS WITH THAT.

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.720
WHEN YOUR GOAL WAS TO FOCUS ON

01:27:05.787 --> 01:27:07.021
PEOPLE WITH LIMITED EDUCATION

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.790
AND A THIRD OF YOUR STUDENTS.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:11.259
HAVE BACHELOR'S DEGREES. AS IT

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.027
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE LIKE I'M

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.329
NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SELLING

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:18.366
YOURSELF- YOU MISTER MEDINA. THE

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:23.605
THIS YEAR- I WILL TAKE THIS BACK

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:29.644
TO WIN THIS- I EIGHT. RIGHT YEAH

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:33.147
THAT WAS THE LITTLE CONFUSED FOR

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:39.420
THAT. RIGHT AND IS THIS. TAKE US

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:40.989
BACK TO THE BEGIN AND WHO THE

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:42.690
STUDENTS WERE GONNA BE AND WHAT

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.025
THIS PRO WAS A FOR AND IT WAS

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.793
VERY MUCH THE THERE WAS A NICHE

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.895
OF STUDENTS OF THOSE ARE NOT

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.397
STUDENTS A NICHE OF WORKERS

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:52.266
ACTUALLY RIGHT WHO WERE

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:55.370
UNSKILLED I NEEDED TO IMPROVE.

01:27:55.436 --> 01:28:00.942
THEIR SKILLS. PEOPLE IN THE-WORKFORCE WHO DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:05.546
TO- TO EDUCATION. AND THAT THIS

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.815
NICHE WAS OUT THERE- THAT IT WAS

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:11.085
NEEDED THAT THIS NEW ENTITY

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:15.390
COULD MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:19.794
WORKING INDIVIDUALS. RIGHT- THE

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:22.497
OTHER ENTITIES MAYBE FOR PROFIT

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:25.133
COLLEGES. WE'RE TAPPING IAN

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:28.369
TAPPING IN TO THE STUDENTS OR TO

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:30.471
THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEEDED TO

01:28:30.538 --> 01:28:34.676
IMPROVE- THEIR SKILLS. AND IT

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.944
WAS THEM WHO THE PROGRAM WAS

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:41.049
INTENDED FOR. AND THAT THERE WAS

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:44.886
A GREAT NEED. FOR SOMETHING LIKE

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:46.921
THIS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:50.525
UNIVERSITIES ADULT ED DIDN'T

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:55.029
MEET THE NEED FOR. AND SO I

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.799
WOULD AGAIN POINT OUT A COUPLE

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:58.800
OF THINGS THAT PROBABLY ALREADY

01:28:58.866 --> 01:29:01.836
HAVE- AND THAT THAT SUCH LOW

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:07.208
NUMBERS DOESN'T SHOW- THE NEED

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.510
FOR IT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:12.947
ATTRACT- THE WORKERS- IN THE

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.316
WORK FORCE SO I HAVEN'T SEEN IT

01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:18.953
BEEN DEMONSTRATED- THAT THE NEED

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:21.689
IS THERE. GIVEN THE LOW NUMBER

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:25.560
OF- FEW STUDENTS WHO HAVE

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.195
PARTICIPATED SINCE THE INCEPTION

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.996
DO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER

01:29:29.063 --> 01:29:31.432
IS HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:34.302
PARTICIPATED IN ANY WAY IN THE

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:36.070
PROGRAM IN THE FOUR YEARS RIGHT

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:38.272
IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT. THREE

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:40.441
YEARS THAT ITS EXISTENCE I DON'T

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:42.210
HAVE THE RUNNING TOTAL I HAVE

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:42.977
OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENTS BUT I'M

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.078
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:47.415
INFORMATION IF IT'S HELPFUL TO.

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:48.883
THE RIGHT NOW IT'S ONE THOUSAND

01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:51.185
STUDENTS RIGHT ONE THOUSAND

01:29:51.252 --> 01:29:53.154
STUDENTS. AND EIGHTY IS THE

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:57.125
TOTAL OF HAPU HAVE FINISHED- IT

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:59.327
IN IN ALL THE TIME THAT COD

01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:01.963
RIGHT AS BEEN. IN EXISTENCE YES

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:04.665
YES SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN HOME

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:07.368
LET'S SAY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:10.538
AFTER THAT AND- OKAY. YEAH I

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.306
DON'T SEE WHERE THE FIGURES

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:14.809
SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:17.345
THAT THAT WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:21.916
WAS NEEDED- SO BADLY. BECAUSE

01:30:21.983 --> 01:30:23.017
THE NUMBERS JUST HAVEN'T BEEN

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:28.289
THERE- IN A ROMAN IN GRADUATION

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:31.459
. AND I THINK THE QUESTION ALSO

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:34.629
CAME UP HOW MANY OF THE

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:38.533
GRADUATES OF THE- EIGHTY RIGHT

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:40.768
THE QUESTION CAME UP HOW MANY OF

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:43.037
THEM HAVEBEEN ABLE TO. TO GET

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.640
JOBS AND TO GET JOBS IN THE

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:48.176
FIELD THAT THEY TRAIN FOR. IS

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:50.611
THAT DATA AVAILABLE. AT THE DATA

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:52.380
IS NOT AVAILABLE ON ACTIVE YET

01:30:52.446 --> 01:30:54.115
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD THAT YOU ASKED

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.516
THAT BECAUSE M. WE ARE VERY

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:56.984
FOCUSED ON THE LABOR MARKET

01:30:57.051 --> 01:30:58.653
OUTCOMES IN ALL OF THE FORMS AND

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.087
WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY ACTUALLY

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:02.490
JOINED THE CCC LAUNCH BOARD AND

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:04.659
SO WE'LL SEE DATA COMING OUT OF

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:06.460
THAT- LIKELY IN THE NEXT TWELVE

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:07.562
MONTHS IT'LL BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:08.930
QUARTER. AND THAT THE DATA

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.131
ITSELF IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.732
GATHER FOR INSTITUTIONS AND SO

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.067
WE ARE ACTUALLY SPENDING A LOT

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:15.102
OF TIMES ON TIME ON BUILDING THE

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.470
DATA INFRASTRUCTURE FOR US TO

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.540
COLLECT A LOT OF DIVERSE- TYPES

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:20.808
OF LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES BECAUSE

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.410
WHAT WE FIND WITH THIS.

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:23.644
POPULATION OF LEARNERS AS WE

01:31:23.711 --> 01:31:24.946
HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FROM THE

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.147
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THEY'RE

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:27.014
EXPERIENCING THE EMPLOYMENT

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:29.283
MARKET AND WHEN WE DO THAT WE

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.184
KNOW THAT FOR SOME CASES. IT IS

01:31:30.251 --> 01:31:32.053
SCALING AND THE JOB THAT THEY

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.255
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN IT

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:35.189
BECAUSE THE SKILLS REQUIREMENTS

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.390
ARE CHANGING IN SOME CASES IT IS

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:38.726
GOING FROM AN HOURLY JOB TO

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:41.195
EIGHTY AND- ADD TO A SALARIED

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:43.130
JOB. AND PROVIDING SOME

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.632
STABILITY IN THEIR WORK AND

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:45.900
LIFE- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:47.068
DIFFERENT LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:48.069
THAT WE DON'T EVEN CURRENTLY

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.271
TRACK IN HIGHER ED GENERALLY OUT

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.539
WERE IN THE WORK FORCE PROGRAMS

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.474
THAT WERE ALSO SEEKING TO AT TO

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.309
TRACK RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA WE

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.544
FEEL THAT A AND- THAT ALUMNI

01:31:56.611 --> 01:31:57.845
SURVEY THAT HELPS US COLLECT

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.413
SOME OF THAT SELF REPORTED DATA.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.715
BUT ULTIMATELY WERE WORKING

01:32:00.781 --> 01:32:02.316
TOWARDS MORE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS IN

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:03.684
THAT REGARD BECAUSE WE NEED

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.052
BETTER DATA ON EMPLOYMENT

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:06.821
OUTCOMES NOT JUST FOR CALIBRATE

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.723
FOR HIRED AS A WHOLE AND SO SOME

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.157
OF THESE METRICS WILL BE A KEY

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:12.193
COMPONENT ABOUT THAT. AND ALL OF

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.094
THAT IS VERY CLEARLY ACTUALLY

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.695
LAID OUT IN TERMS OF OUR

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:15.830
EFFORTS. IN OUR THREE YEAR

01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:16.898
STRATEGIC VISION THAT HAS BEEN

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:19.967
ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.435
TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS QUESTION

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:22.169
OF- THE EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES IN

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:27.608
ADDITION. COMES TO MAY- FOR

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:28.910
YEARS IN THREE YEARS AND THIS

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:32.914
PROGRAM OUT WITHOUT THAT DATA. I

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.649
DON'T KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.183
COULD REACH ANY KIND OF

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.786
CONCLUSION AS TO THE VALUE OF

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:42.290
THE PROGRAM- TO THOSE EIGHTY

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:44.292
INDIVIDUALS EVEN WHO COMPLETED

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:46.527
IT OUT WITHOUT WITHOUT THAT

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:50.998
KNOWLEDGE- WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:53.567
AT ALL. TO SEE YOU KNOW. HOW OF

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:57.705
THEIR- JOB SITUATION IMPROVED-

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:00.441
WERE THEY ABLE TO MOVE UP IN

01:33:00.508 --> 01:33:02.743
INCOME. WITH WITHOUT THAT I JUST

01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:04.812
DON'T SEE HOW YOU KNOW WE CAN

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:07.548
DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS- ANSWER

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:08.983
THAT WAS ALSO A KEY

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:10.518
RECOMMENDATION OF THAT STATE

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:12.887
AUDITOR TO AT THE ASKS A LOT OF

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.288
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE WOULD

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:15.156
BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DATA

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:16.557
COLLECTION AROUND THOSE THINGS

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:18.492
TO MANY OF THOSE PLANS ARE. AT

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:19.894
DEFINED IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.629
STATE AUDIT AND THEY JUST NEED

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.164
TIME TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS WAS IN

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.566
AGAIN ENVISIONED UNDER THE SEVEN

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.401
YEAR STARTUP TIME FRAME. TO THE

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:31.339
IDEA OF- I THINK I THINK IN HERE

01:33:31.405 --> 01:33:32.807
THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION. OF

01:33:32.873 --> 01:33:36.310
STARTING- THE NURSING PROGRAM.

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:38.145
CORRECT A LICENSED VOCATIONAL

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:39.780
NURSING LICENSE VOCATIONAL

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.716
ALBEIT WHICH WHICH WHICH WOULD

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.217
YOU SAY THAT THAT IS DIFFERENT

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:45.319
FROM THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF WHAT

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:47.288
KIND OF RIGHT WAS SET UP TO DO I

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.123
DO NOT WORK OURS IS A COMPETENCY

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.591
BASED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.226
THE AUDITOR THEMSELVES RECOGNIZE

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:54.228
THE DIFFERENTIATION OF OUR MODEL

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:55.896
THAT IT IS ASYNCHRONOUS THAT IS

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.298
TARGET AROUND A PARTICULAR

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:58.833
POPULATION OF LEARNERS THAT

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.267
THERE WAS A NEED FOR IT- SO.

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.269
WE'RE REALLY RELYING ON ON THAT

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.604
DEFINITION OF IT THE LPN PROGRAM

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:04.805
IS PARTICULARLY UNIQUE BECAUSE

01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:06.874
OF ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH SEIU

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.943
UNITED HEALTHCARE WORKERS-

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:10.911
BECAUSE IT STANDS TO PRESENT A

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:13.547
SCALABLE SOLUTION WITH A PARTNER

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:14.982
WHO WILL SUPPORT THE CLINICAL

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.851
PLACEMENT ASPECTS OF. THE

01:34:16.917 --> 01:34:18.386
PROGRAM ITSELF TO ADDRESS

01:34:18.452 --> 01:34:19.854
CRITICAL SHORTAGES IN THE STATE

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.855
BUT ALSO REALLY TO DIVERSIFY THE

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.757
PIPELINE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.392
WAYS IN WHICH WE FACILITATE MORE

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.826
EQUITABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:28.229
MANY AREAS AND THAT OUR HEALTH

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.431
CARE DESERT'S AT THIS IS A CORE

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.401
PART OF AN ACCESS POINT THAT

01:34:33.467 --> 01:34:34.535
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AT CAN CAN

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:37.538
REACH AN IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY-

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.473
WITH A PARTNER ON THE GROUND WHO

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.142
CARES A LOT ABOUT THOSE WORKERS

01:34:41.208 --> 01:34:44.111
WHERE THE JOBS WILL HAVE MARKERS

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.446
OF JOB QUALITY. WOULD YOU YOU

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.214
WOULDN'T SAY THAT THIS IS A

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:49.383
CHANGE FROM THE ORIGINAL INTENT.

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.185
OF THE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATION

01:34:51.252 --> 01:34:52.853
SPEAKS S. SERVE VERY

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.389
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT- THE TYPES OF

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.824
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE IMPORTANT

01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:59.226
FOR THE COLLEGE TO HAVE. AND YOU

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:00.895
KNOW LABOR IS IT IS A CRITICAL

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:02.196
PARTNER FOR US THAT'S TRUE IN

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:03.998
TERMS OF. AND THE WORK THAT

01:35:04.065 --> 01:35:05.299
WE'RE DOING PROGRAMMATIC LEE

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:06.801
WITH THAT CA YOU AND IT'S

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.135
EQUALLY TRUE OF THE LABOR

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.303
REPRESENTATION THAT OUR

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:10.971
EMPLOYEES ENJOY A FROM THE

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.373
CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.776
AND- AT CSEA. THE SCHOOL

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:19.013
EMPLOYEES. BUT LV ENDS ARE-

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.815
BEING TRAINED NOW BY COMMUNITY

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:23.284
COLLEGES. AT THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.752
OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT DO

01:35:24.819 --> 01:35:27.421
YOU HAVE LPN PROGRAMS NOT

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:28.956
COMPETENCY BASED ASYNCHRONOUS

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.991
SKILLS BASED PROGRAMS NOT THOSE

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:32.159
WITH A CLINICAL PLACEMENT

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:33.227
PARTNERS SO THERE'S MANY

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.128
IMPORTANT AREAS OF

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.496
DIFFERENTIATION. AND THEY'RE

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.731
SEVERE UNDER PRODUCTION TO IN

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:38.999
TERMS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.102
THEMSELVES. BUT WHAT I'M HOPEFUL

01:35:41.168 --> 01:35:42.036
IS- IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.104
WE'RE DESIGNING THE PARTNERSHIP

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.638
IS THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.273
TO CONNECT SOME OF THE

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.441
CHALLENGES THAT HAD THE OTHER

01:35:47.508 --> 01:35:48.976
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE FACED.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.679
WITH RESPECT TO- HAVING MORE

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:53.681
SCALABLE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:54.815
THOSE PROGRAMS A CLINICAL

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:56.016
PLACEMENTS AT FIRST FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:58.052
TEND TO BE A BOTTLENECK IN THIS

01:35:58.119 --> 01:36:00.087
AREA AND IF WE LOOK AT PROGRAMS

01:36:00.154 --> 01:36:02.189
IN THE L. THE END SPACE THAT

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:05.126
ARE. AT PARTICULARLY- IN THE

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:07.695
QUEUE FOR APPROVAL FOR EXAMPLE-

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.697
WHAT WE FIND IS MANY OF THEM ARE

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:11.132
NOT ACTUALLY AT THE COMMUNITY

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:12.833
COLLEGES SO THIS CAN BE A VERY

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:13.801
SUPPORTIVE MECHANISMS WHERE WE

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.469
SEE AND THAT INCREASING THE

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:16.337
NUMBER OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:17.738
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS VERY

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:19.039
IMPORTANT FLAT FRONT LINE HEALTH

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:21.075
CARE WORKER ROLE AND IT'S ALSO

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:22.877
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PARTNER

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.645
WITH OTHER COMMUNITY. IS WHO ARE

01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.380
ALSO AT YOU NEED IN THAT REGARD

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:27.915
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.183
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN BE BUILT

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.051
HERE THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.186
THE WHOLE SYSTEM WE'RE WE'RE

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.955
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.891
YEAH WELL I WOULD SAY THAT IN

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:37.892
CAN. FOR ME AND MY QUESTIONS AND

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:42.396
COMMENTS. I AS A AS A TEACHER.

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.965
WAS VERY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE

01:36:45.032 --> 01:36:47.434
PROGRAM AT THE OUTSET. BECAUSE

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:49.637
AS I THINK THE CHAIR. HAS

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:52.840
MENTIONED. THAT THIS GROUP OF

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:54.775
INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE HIRED TO

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:57.578
TRAIN. BECAUSE PERHAPS BECAUSE

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.681
OF NOT HAVING A LOT OF EDUCATION

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:03.217
. RIGHT THE IDEA OF DOING IT

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:06.086
ONLINE- WITHOUT A LOT OF-

01:37:06.153 --> 01:37:09.323
PERSONAL CONTACT TO ME DIDN'T

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:12.693
DIDN'T SEEM TO JIVE YOU KNOW WHO

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.161
THE STUDENTS WERE AND THE METHOD

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:17.431
OF DELIVERY. AND THAT WAS A PRE

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:19.833
PANDEMIC PRE GOING WAY UP ONLINE

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.437
SO I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL CRITICAL

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:27.575
- AND OPPOSE- THE PROGRAM AT THE

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:30.678
OUTSET. WE'RE WE'RE NOW- AS BEEN

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:34.048
POINTED OUT- FOUR YEARS IN AT

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:36.584
LEAST INTO THE FUNDING OF IT- WE

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:39.820
SEE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF US-

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:42.156
I WOULD GIVE YOU THAT THERE BEEN

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:44.491
SOME IMPROVEMENTS I SOME

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:46.660
IMPROVEMENTS SINCE THE ADDED-

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:49.430
CERTAINLY- ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:53.334
WE'VE SEEN. MUCH IMPROVEMENT-

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.569
THERE AT LEAST WITH THE

01:37:55.636 --> 01:37:57.471
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.872
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:01.508
LEGISLATURE- WELL GRATEFUL FOR

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:05.512
THAT- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:38:05.579 --> 01:38:06.847
. IT DOES COME TO THE

01:38:06.914 --> 01:38:11.819
LEGISLATURE. IN FUNDING AND TO

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:14.421
MAKE DECISIONS TO MAKE DECISIONS

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:16.857
ON WHERE WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND-

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:19.260
WHERE WE THINK WE GET MORE OF

01:38:19.326 --> 01:38:21.695
FOR OUR MONEY- AND WHERE THE

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:25.332
STUDENTS DO SO- AGAIN WE'RE

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:27.935
FACED WITH WITH WITH THE NUMBERS

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.870
WERE FACED WITH HAVING TO MAKE

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:32.039
THOSE KIND OF DISTANCE. I REMIND

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.975
MY COLLEAGUES THAT I STILL HAVE-

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:37.278
IN THE IN THE WORKS BUT

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.747
LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD CALL FOR

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:43.450
THE END OF COUNT RIGHT- IT'S AN-

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:47.021
FORGET EXACTLY WHERE IT IS BUT-

01:38:47.087 --> 01:38:51.892
I SHARE MY COLLEAGUES- CONCERNS.

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.160
THAT I'VE EXPRESSED OVER THE

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:56.730
YEARS AND OUT I'M NOT CONVINCED

01:38:56.797 --> 01:38:58.932
THAT IT IS THE BEST USE OF THE

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:01.969
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS- VERY

01:39:02.036 --> 01:39:05.072
LIMITED RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:09.576
TO EDUCATION. THANK MR LEE.

01:39:09.643 --> 01:39:11.211
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- I'LL

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.146
I'LL BE BRIEF JUST BECAUSE I'M

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.714
RUNNING BETWEEN COMMITTEES BUT I

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.149
DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.084

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.786
SAID LAST YEAR YOU KNOW YOU ARE

01:39:18.852 --> 01:39:20.788
HANDED A- A HAND THAT IS THAT IS

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:21.955
NOT FAVORABLE IN THIS REGARD

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:22.990
AND- I CERTAINLY WAS NOT HERE

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.858
WHEN CALVERT WAS INSTITUTED BUT

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.827
STILL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FAN

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:27.895
OF EVEN PRE PANDEMIC I THINK

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:29.363
REALLY WHAT OUR INSTITUTIONS OF

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.431
HIGHER LEARNING EVEN ARCADE AS

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:32.199
WELL THE TWO CATIONS SESSION OF

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.334
FIGURING OUT AS THEY CAN HAVE

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:34.468
THE MEDITATION OF ONLINE

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.602
LEARNING AND SOMETIMES I THINK

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.438
WITH THE COMMUNITY ROOTED FOCUS

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:39.006
OF EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THEY

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:43.110
ARE MORE PREDISPOSITION TO BE A

01:39:43.177 --> 01:39:44.011
GATEWAY ACCESS OF VISUAL

01:39:44.078 --> 01:39:45.646
LEARNING HAVING MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:46.947
I'M ALL FOR FREE I'M ALL FOR

01:39:47.014 --> 01:39:48.415
EXPERIMENTATION FIGURE OUT NEW

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:49.783
THINGS CAN TRY THESE THINGS BUT

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.618
I THINK EVEN IN THE SHORT AMOUNT

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.020
OF TIME GIVEN THE RESULTS WERE

01:39:53.087 --> 01:39:54.355
SAYING IT'S NOT QUITE THE

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:56.156
RESULTS YOU WANT TO SEE AND AT

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:57.725
THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW REAL LIFE

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.927
HAS ALSO CAUGHT UP IN THAT SENSE

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:00.828
THE PANDEMIC SHOWED EVERYONE

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.029
ELSE WITH DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:03.063
CLEAR DEAL ACCESS COULD LOOK

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:05.332
LIKE AND AGAIN THAT'S OUT OF

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:05.966
YOUR CONTROL YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:06.900
YOUR DO YOUR BEST WITH THE CARDS

01:40:06.967 --> 01:40:08.769
YOU'RE DEALT. I STILL DON'T

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:10.337
THINK I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TO

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.839
THIS YEAR SO I SUPPORT OUR

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.707
COLLEAGUES EFFORTS TO FIGURE OUT

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:15.476
HOW WE CAN REALLOCATE THESE

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:16.009
RESOURCES ESPECIALLY INTO

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:16.643

THINK INSTEAD OF HAVING A NEW

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:21.949
INFRASTRUCTURE CAN JUST REINVEST

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:23.217
IN THE OLD INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.752

OFFICE AS YOUR GENDER DENOTES

THE COST OF LIVING RATE FOR

01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.925
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. IS

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:19.693
LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN THE

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.629
FIVE POINT 33% PROPOSED IN THE

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.831
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OUR OFFICE

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:28.201
ESTIMATES ABOUT A SIX POINT 2%

01:43:28.268 --> 01:43:30.437
OF THE COST OF LIVING

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:31.605
ADJUSTMENT- RATE WHICH WOULD

01:43:31.672 --> 01:43:33.540
COST ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:35.242
DOLLARS MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:37.110
PROPOSES IS IN HIS JANUARY

01:43:37.177 --> 01:43:39.746
BUDGET. YOUR TURN A CARD IS YOU

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.281
POINTED OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:42.549
THE HEARING. YOU HAVE A NUMBER

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:43.250
OF COST PRESSURES OF THE

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:44.618
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CURRENTLY

01:43:44.685 --> 01:43:47.588
FIRST YOU HAVE- EMPLOYEES THEIR

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:50.257
OWN COST OF LIVING. HAS GONE UP

01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:51.959
BECAUSE OF INFLATION SO THERE'S

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.927
PRESSURE ON DISTRICTS PROVIDE TO

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:56.463
PROVIDE PAY INCREASES. DISTRICTS

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:58.098
OF ALSO HAVE REQUIRED

01:43:58.165 --> 01:44:00.367
CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS AND CAL

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:02.536
STIRS THE PENSIONS AND THAT'S

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.371
EXPECTED TO GO UP BY ABOUT A

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:05.038
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

01:44:05.105 --> 01:44:06.974
DOLLARS IN TOTAL IN THE BUDGET

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.575
YEAR. NOW DISTRICTS ARE

01:44:08.642 --> 01:44:10.711
REALIZING SOME SAVINGS IN THE

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:13.647
CURRENT YEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:15.616
RUNNING AS MANY- COURSE SECTIONS

01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.618
THERE'S SO THERE'S SOME SAVINGS

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.620
FROM PART TIME FACULTY NOT

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.288
NEEDING THOSE TEMPORARY FACULTY.

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:23.824
DUE TO LOWER- ENROLLMENT DEMAND.

01:44:23.890 --> 01:44:25.325
RIGHT IF THAT TREND WERE TO

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.561
CONTINUE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:44:27.628 --> 01:44:29.262
THREE DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:31.498
SEE SAVINGS THOUGH LIKELY NOT

01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:33.400
ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE UPWARD

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:34.568
PRESSURE THE DISTRICTS ARE

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:37.537
EXPERIENCING IN THEIR BUDGETS.

01:44:37.604 --> 01:44:40.073
SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.375
MAKE A DECISION ON A CALL THE

01:44:41.441 --> 01:44:44.344
RATE. ONCE OF THE STATE GETS

01:44:44.411 --> 01:44:46.947
UPDATED INFORMATION- FROM THE

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.448
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

01:44:48.515 --> 01:44:50.283
LATER THIS MONTH. AND THEN

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.918
LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT

01:44:51.985 --> 01:44:53.787
THAT UPDATED CALL THE RATE THE

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:55.322
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:56.957
GUARANTEE WHERE THAT'S TRENDING

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:59.760
IT MAY REVISE AND MAKE A

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.094
DECISION THEN ON THE KOLA. WITH

01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:02.963
REGARD TO THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.131
FUNDING FORMULA THE

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:05.399
APPORTIONMENT FUNDING FOR THE

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:07.968
COLLEGES- MISTER HAD OUR JUST

01:45:08.035 --> 01:45:09.970
DESCRIBED THE GOVERNOR'S

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:12.472
PROPOSAL ON THE HOLD HARMLESS

01:45:12.539 --> 01:45:14.408
PROVISION. NOW WHEN THE STATE

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:15.976
CREATED THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:19.413
FUNDING FORMULA BACK IN TWO

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:20.047
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THERE

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:21.682
ARE A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IT

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:23.250
ENDED UP GENERATING LESS MONEY.

01:45:23.316 --> 01:45:25.052
UNDER THE NEW FORMULA THAN UNDER

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:27.020
THE OLD FORMULA AND SO THE

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:28.321
LEGISLATURE AGREED TO PROVIDE

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:29.923
TEMPORARY FUNDING TO THOSE

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.092
DISTRICTS THESE. SO CALLED HOLD

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.560
HARMLESS FUNDING TO HELP THEM

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.295
TRANSITION TO GIVE THEM TIME TO

01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:37.197
TRANSITION. NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.999
A PROPOSAL HERE THAT'S INTENDED

01:45:39.066 --> 01:45:42.269
TO PREVENT MANY DISTRICTS FROM

01:45:42.335 --> 01:45:43.737
HITTING A FISCAL CLIFF IN A FEW

01:45:43.804 --> 01:45:46.173
YEARS. THE STATE CURRENT HOLD

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:47.507
HARMLESS VISION IS SCHEDULED TO

01:45:47.574 --> 01:45:49.409
END AND DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:52.279
BASED ON THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.614
FUNDING FORMULA. SO WE THINK THE

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.284
GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF. SEVENTEEN A

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:58.819
FISCAL CLIFF FOR THESE DISTRICTS

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:01.988
IS LAUDABLE AT THE SAME TIME OF

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:04.191
BEING A HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICT

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.892
MEANS RECEIVING A PORTION OF

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:08.328
FUNDING REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.130
STUDENTS THE DISTRICT'S SERVICE.

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:12.699
REGARDLESS OF WHO THOSE STUDENTS

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.668
ARE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOMES

01:46:14.735 --> 01:46:17.504
OF THOSE STUDENTS SO BEING A

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.039
HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICT GETTING

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:20.440
MONEY NO MATTER WHAT REALLY

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:22.209
CREATES A POOR INCENTIVES ON

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:23.210
THOSE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:26.279
SHOULD STRIVE TO GET DISTRICTS

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:28.248
OFFICE HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING.

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:29.950
AND FUNDED BASED ON THE STUDENT

01:46:30.016 --> 01:46:32.786
CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AS SOON

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:34.488
AS POSSIBLE. ONE WAY TO DO THAT

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:36.556
WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE VALUE

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:38.058
OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:41.128
FORMULA THROUGH BASE INCREASES.

01:46:41.194 --> 01:46:42.062
BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:44.464
ADJUSTMENT AND SO WE RECOMMEND

01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:45.365
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

01:46:45.432 --> 01:46:46.566
GOVERNOR'S HOLD HARMLESS

01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:48.568
PROVOKED PROPOSAL. BUT GO

01:46:48.635 --> 01:46:49.936
FURTHER THAN THAT AND BEGIN

01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:51.705
EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:54.040
RAISING THE BASE FUNDING FOR THE

01:46:54.107 --> 01:46:55.509
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:57.778
SO THE DISTRICTS ARE GENERATING

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:59.813
MORE THROUGH IT THEN CURRENTLY.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:01.047
SO LEGISLATURE COULD DO

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:02.749
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT IT DID

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.151
WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:07.387
FORMULA WITH K. TWELVE SET A-

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:09.256
TARGET LEVEL OF BASE FUNDING.

01:47:09.322 --> 01:47:12.659
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE

01:47:12.726 --> 01:47:15.362
TO SEE- FOR THE CALL DISTRICTS

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.764
FUNDED AT. AND THEN LOOK AT THE

01:47:17.831 --> 01:47:18.965
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:20.734
GUARANTEE SO LOOK AT THAT GROWTH

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:21.902
IN THE GUARANTEE AND THEN

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:23.703
DEVELOP A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR

01:47:23.770 --> 01:47:25.572
REACHING THOSE TARGETS. AND AT

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.307
HIGHER BASE ALSO HAS THE

01:47:27.374 --> 01:47:30.076
ADVANTAGE OF HELPING DISTRICTS

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:32.279
ADDRESS A HIGHER OPERATING COSTS

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:35.182
. THE TWO OTHER- ITEMS IN THE

01:47:35.248 --> 01:47:37.317
GENERAL THE SNOW VERY BRIEFLY-

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:38.952
FIRST WE DO WE ALSO AGREE WITH

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.587
THE GOVERNOR THAT ADDING FIRST

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:41.788
GENERATION METRIC TO THE

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.456
STUDENTS SENDING. CENTER FUNDING

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:46.960
FORMULA HAS MERIT- ONCE- THE

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:49.196
LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO GET

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:51.565
BETTER DATA FROM THE DISTRICTS

01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:53.300
ON FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WE

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:55.268
ALSO DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.270
ABOUT FORTY DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:47:57.337 --> 01:47:59.239
NOT ON A HOLD HARMLESS THERE

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.807
FUNDED BY THE STUDENT CENTERED

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.309
FORM FUNDING FORMULA BUT THEY'RE

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.077
CURRENTLY BEING PROTECTED BY

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:05.245
WHAT'S CALLED EMERGENCY

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:07.180
CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. SO THIS IS

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:09.282
MONEY THAT THEY'RE GETTING DUE

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:10.584
TO THE PANDEMIC SO THEY'RE BEING

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:13.153
FUNDED AT PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS AS

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.855
IF THE PANDEMIC COULD NOT HIT.

01:48:14.921 --> 01:48:16.923
WELL THAT DEALS THOSE EMERGENCY

01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:19.326
CONDITIONS ALLOWANCES WHICH IS

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:20.827
AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:22.429
GOVERNORS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:48:22.495 --> 01:48:24.497
OFFICE ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE.

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:26.600
AT THE END OF THIS YEAR SO AT

01:48:26.666 --> 01:48:28.702
THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:31.404
TWO. AND IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN

01:48:31.471 --> 01:48:33.106
DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE KIND OF A

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.307
ONE YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD OF

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:37.844
AND STARTING IN TWENTY THREE

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:39.713
TWENTY FOUR. YOU TO HAVE A

01:48:39.779 --> 01:48:41.047
NUMBER OF DISTRICTS TO START TO

01:48:41.114 --> 01:48:43.350
SEE A REDUCTION IN THE FUNDING

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:44.217
LEVELS AND THEIR PORTION IT

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.352
FUNDING. SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY

01:48:45.418 --> 01:48:46.152
WANTED TO ADD REQUEST THE

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:47.220
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:49.389
AN UPDATE. ON THESE EMERGENCY

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:51.057
CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. WHAT

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:53.126
THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO IF THEY

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:55.128
DECIDED YET WHETHER TO EXTEND

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:56.029
NEIGHBORS TO CONDITIONS

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:57.898
ALLOWANCE FOR ANOTHER YEAR SO I

01:48:57.964 --> 01:48:59.566
THINK THEY'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:00.066
FOR LEGISLATORS OF. THE

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:02.102
LEGISLATURE TO THINK OF- IN THE

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:06.206
NEXT YEAR. AND CLOSING OUT THIS

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:09.676
BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:12.045
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. GOOD MORNING

AGAIN WAS THAT NEVER WITH

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.814
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:15.849
THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:17.284
FORMULAS KEY PART OF THE

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.351
SOLUTION TO AN EQUITABLE

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.186
RECOVERY AS YOU KNOW THAT

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:21.521
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA

01:49:21.588 --> 01:49:24.291
PROVIDES FUNDING FOR ACCESS AND

01:49:24.357 --> 01:49:26.226
ROMAN BASE FUNDING TO STUDENT

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:28.395
EQUITY BY TARGETING- FUNDS TO

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.963
DISTRICTS SERVING LOW INCOME

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:32.265
STUDENTS AND FOR STUDENT SUCCESS

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:34.267
BY PROVIDING DISTRICTS WITH

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:36.536
RESOURCES FOR SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME

01:49:36.603 --> 01:49:37.771
. I HEARD TO THE STUDENTS AND

01:49:37.837 --> 01:49:39.439
THE FUNDING FORMULA DISTRICTS

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:41.174
WERE FUNDED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.842
ENROLLMENT FUNDING SOMETHING

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:44.611
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS

01:49:44.678 --> 01:49:46.046
DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WE'VE

01:49:46.112 --> 01:49:47.847
LEARNED AS AN APPROACH THAT DID

01:49:47.914 --> 01:49:49.382
NOT WORK. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR

01:49:49.449 --> 01:49:50.917
ADVANCING THE STUDENTS FULL CHEN

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:52.552
EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY BEYOND THE

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:54.287
INITIAL ENROLLMENT AND IT WOULD

01:49:54.354 --> 01:49:56.056
NOT OF WORK IN THE MIDST OF

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:58.325
THESE- DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS THAT

01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:00.126
WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATES-

01:50:00.193 --> 01:50:00.961
WHEN DISTRICTS HAVE SEEN

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:03.797
ENROLLMENT DECLINES EVEN BEFORE

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:06.066
THE PANDEMIC- EVEN BEFORE THE

01:50:06.132 --> 01:50:07.968
PANDEMIC DISTRICTS WERE EXPECTED

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:10.236
TO LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:11.905
YOU TO ENROLLMENT DECLINES SO

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.873
THE S. C. EFFORT RECOGNIZES THAT

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.576
A COLLEGES WORK ENCOMPASSES-

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.745
MORE THAN JUST ENROLLMENT. AND

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:21.414
CRITICAL ACADEMIC AND STUDENT

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:22.315

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.792
CHAIN PROVIDES DISTRICTS WITH

01:50:32.859 --> 01:50:35.161
STABILITY- AS THEY WORK TO RE

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:37.764

BEGINNING TO SEE- SOME EARLY

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:54.614
INDICATORS THAT SHOW THAT-

01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:40.727
CONSIDER SPECIFICALLY WANT TO

01:51:40.794 --> 01:51:42.062
HIGHLIGHT A POINT THAT INCREASE

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:44.731
IN THE SCFA BASE RATE WOULD HELP

01:51:44.798 --> 01:51:46.566
COLLEGES IN ADDRESSING SEVERAL

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.902
CHALLENGES. NOT ONLY WHAT A

DISTRICTS FACING ENROLLMENT TO

01:51:58.078 --> 01:52:00.280
CRY DECLINES TO SOFTEN THAT

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:02.515
ASSOCIATED FUNDING. ONE SOLUTION

01:52:02.582 --> 01:52:04.951
IS A- CONSIDERATION OF A THREE

TO SUPPORT IT BETTER THAN WE

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:52.132
HAVE. AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.967
TO FUND IT ADEQUATELY AND I LOOK

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:54.968
AT THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IT WAS

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:57.437
IN JANUARY S. AND I REALIZE THIS

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:59.606
IS A PROCESS. BUT A FIVE POINT

01:52:59.672 --> 01:53:02.642
33% COAL IS WOEFULLY. INADEQUATE

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:05.378
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE- THAT GOES

01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:08.281
FOR THE K. TWELVE SIDE TO- AND

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:10.116
WHY IS IT. WAS AND HOW IT WHAT I

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.217
KEEP HEARING OUR HISTORIC

01:53:11.284 --> 01:53:13.386
NUMBERS A STORE NUMBERS HISTORIC

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:15.755
NOT A HISTORIC INCREASE. THAT

01:53:15.822 --> 01:53:18.825
MATCHES- YOU KNOW HAVE. HISTORIC

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:22.328
INFLATION. RIGHT THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:23.596
SEEN IN FORTY YEARS. SO THAT

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:25.031
FIVE POINT 33% DOESN'T EVEN MEET

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:27.033
INFLATION. LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:28.768

5% PLUS. STIRS IN PERSIAN MIX

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:51.691
SOMEONE AVERAGE GET TWO POINT

01:53:51.758 --> 01:53:52.959
THREE FIVE. AND THEN YOU COME UP

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.894

01:53:54.961 --> 01:53:57.297

COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM LAST

01:54:09.509 --> 01:54:12.212
YEAR TO THIS YEAR SO FIVE POINT

01:54:12.278 --> 01:54:15.114
33% IS WAY TOO LOW AND THIS

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:16.649
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADDRESS

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:19.819
THAT- I APPRECIATE THE

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:20.887
CONVERSATION AROUND THE HOLD

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:22.822
HARMLESS AND I THINK THE IDEA

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:23.890
HERE. THE MECHANISM THE

THAT WE MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT MEET.

01:54:50.183 --> 01:54:52.518
ARE MORE ASPIRATIONAL. THAN THEY

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:54.787
ARE REALITY AND SO THIS YEAR WE

01:54:54.854 --> 01:54:56.122

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:08.254
BASIC INFORMATION TO MAKE AN

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:10.189
INFORMED DECISION. ON THIS

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:13.126
PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:15.395
CURRENTLY DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY

01:57:15.461 --> 01:57:16.529
FACULTY PART TIME FACULTY

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:19.332
ALREADY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:20.133
AND WHERE THEY GET THAT

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:21.701
INSURANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.736
ALSO DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY PART

01:57:23.803 --> 01:57:26.072
TIME FACULTY LACK. HEALTH CARE

01:57:26.139 --> 01:57:27.840
INSURANCE BUT DESPITE THE

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:30.076
STATE'S REQUIREMENT THAT ALL

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:31.644
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ADEQUATE

01:57:31.711 --> 01:57:33.646
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE SO WITHOUT

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.681
THIS BASIC INFORMATION IT'S

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:37.517
REALLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:39.152
LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE IF

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:41.087
THERE'S A PROBLEM AND HOW

01:57:41.154 --> 01:57:43.990
WIDESPREAD THAT PROBLEM MIGHT

01:57:44.056 --> 01:57:49.996
BE. THE. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.431
PART TIME FACULTY BUT THE

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:53.433
LEGISLATURE HAS LIMITED

01:57:53.499 --> 01:57:54.901
INFORMATION CURRENTLY ON THE

01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:57.303
EXTENT OF THAT COVERAGE AT

01:57:57.370 --> 01:58:00.072
DISTRICT PROVIDED COVERAGE. AND

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:02.708
THE COST THAT DISTRICTS ARE

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:04.410
PASSED ON TO EMPLOYEES OR MAKE

01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:05.878
EMPLOYEES CHARGING WHETHER SOME

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:08.014
PART TIME FACULTY MIGHT IN FACT

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.549
HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF GETTING

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:11.551
THEIR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:12.585
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:14.387
THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.756
PROVIDES SUBSIDIES FOR MANY

01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:18.724
CALIFORNIANS. THE GOVERNOR'S

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:19.892
APPROACH TO PROVIDING HEALTH

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:21.594
CARE TO PART TIME FACULTY

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:23.062
THROUGH DISTRICT SPONSORED

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:28.534
PLANS- SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN INTO

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:31.070
ACCOUNT- GIVEN THAT PART TIME

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:33.506
FACULTY ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:35.007
EMPLOYEES AND I MENTIONED THAT

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.242
IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE THEY'RE

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:38.344
CONSIDERED TEMPORARY M. DISTRICT

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:40.213
EMPLOYEES. THEY MAY NOT BE

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.181
RETAIN FROM ONE SEMESTER TO THE

01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:45.384
NEXT FOR ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT

01:58:45.451 --> 01:58:46.953
AND SO EVEN IF A DISTRICT THEIR

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:50.056
DISTRICT WERE TO OFFER ROBUST

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:52.024
COVERAGE TO PART TIME FACULTY

01:58:52.091 --> 01:58:55.127
THE LEGISLATURE FACES THE POLICY

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:57.096
QUESTION. OF WHETHER. THIS KEEPS

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:58.564
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM REALLY

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.399
IS THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.401
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. GIVEN THAT

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:04.570
YOU COULD HAVE PART TIME FACULTY

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:06.105
WORKING FOR A DISTRICT BECAUSE

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:07.573
THEY NEEDED TO TEACH CLASSES

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.408
THERE ON HEALTHCARE AND THEN

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:11.477
THEY'RE TOLD THEY'RE NOT NEEDED

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:12.778
FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER THE NEXT

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:14.647
YEAR AND THEY MIGHT BE OFF THE

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:16.482
INSURANCE AT THAT POINT THAT

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:19.585
COULD BE VERY DISRUPTIVE AND

01:59:19.652 --> 01:59:20.386
UNSTABLE. FOUR THESE IN TE

01:59:20.453 --> 01:59:21.988
EMPLOYEES USE TEMPORARY

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.723
EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:59:23.789 --> 01:59:24.857
OF COURSE THERE'S A QUESTION

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:25.892
ABOUT WHAT ABOUT PART TIME

01:59:25.958 --> 01:59:28.060
FACULTY PART TIME EMPLOYEES

01:59:28.127 --> 01:59:30.363
RATHER WORKING- IN OTHER STATE

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:32.698
AGENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES. SO

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.667
WE RECOMMEND- THE LEGISLATURE

01:59:34.734 --> 01:59:36.302
DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO GET

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:38.137

INSURED STATUS A PART TIME

01:59:39.705 --> 01:59:42.008
FACULTY. AND ON PART TIME

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:44.110
FACULTY HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT

ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED BY

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:46.712
DISTRICTS THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:59:46.779 --> 01:59:47.880
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:59:47.947 --> 01:59:50.116
WORK WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES

THE STATE. AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:59:56.355 --> 01:59:57.590
COULD GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:00.860

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:04.564
ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE COULD

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:07.800
USE THAT INFORMATION. TO REALLY

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:09.969
HELP BUILD- THE TO GATHER

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.737
INFORMATION USE IT TO MAKE AN

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:13.472
ASSESSMENT OF TO INFORM

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:16.442
POTENTIAL BUDGET DECISIONS FOR

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:18.144
NEXT BUDGET YEAR ONCE THIS

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.213
INFORMATION REALLY IS SOLID AND

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.349
WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF

02:00:23.416 --> 02:00:25.885
THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. THANK

WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE A ROBUST

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.428
INVESTMENT IN PART TIME FACULTY

02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:38.864

02:00:38.931 --> 02:00:39.999
NINETY THOUSAND WE'VE LONG BEEN

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.634
UNDER INVESTING IN HEALTH FOR A

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:43.369
PART TIME FACULTY WE ARE

CARE I BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:00:48.374 --> 02:00:50.076
INVESTMENT IS LONG OVERDUE.

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:51.844
FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS

WITH DISTRICTS IN FACULTY

02:00:52.812 --> 02:00:54.947
PARTNERS WE DO BELIEVE THAT AN

02:00:55.014 --> 02:00:56.849
ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROGRAM

02:00:56.916 --> 02:01:00.686
OVERALL IS A WARRANTED- ONE THAT

02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:03.623
WOULD PROVIDE ON A GREATER-

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:05.591
HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT RATIO

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:07.360
CURRENTLY DISTRICTS CAN ONLY BE

EXPENDITURES AND PART TIME

02:01:10.663 --> 02:01:13.065
FACULTY HEALTH THIS LIMITS THE

02:01:13.132 --> 02:01:15.201
ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PART

02:01:15.267 --> 02:01:17.069
TIME FACULTY HEALTH PROGRAMS OR

02:01:17.136 --> 02:01:19.538
LIMITS THE FEASIBILITY OF

OFFERING QUALITY PROGRAMS. THIS

02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:23.943
SPECIFICALLY HE WE WOULD REQUEST

PART TIME FACULTY DISTRICTS

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:37.556
DISTRICTS WOULD ALSO CONSIDER-

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:40.126
MAKING ELIGIBLE REIMBURSEMENTS

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:41.961

REIMBURSEMENT- AND WE CURRENTLY

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.933
HAVE THIRTY THREE DISTRICTS THAT

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.069
ARE PARTICIPATING- AND THEY

02:02:23.135 --> 02:02:24.737

DOLLAR FOR THEIR REIMBURSEMENT-

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:47.860
THIS WOULD ALLOW- MORE TO

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.995

PROGRAM. SO PAID US A PICTURE OF

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:58.671
A HYPOTHETICAL OF HOW THIS WOULD

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:01.340
IMPACT A PART TIME. MANY COLLEGE

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:03.409

WHAT HAPPENED WITH THEM.

02:03:11.484 --> 02:03:14.019
CURRENTLY NOT ALL DISTRICTS

INCLUDE A HEALTH OR DENTAL- AND

THE DISTRICT PAYS ANOTHER

02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:45.184
PORTION. ARE AND OF WHAT THIS

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:48.220

TIME FACULTY TO GET THEIR

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:22.901
HEALTHCARE ALREADY FROM

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:23.936
SOMEWHERE ELSE LOOKS LIKE IT'S A

02:07:24.003 --> 02:07:26.038
FAIRLY LARGE PERCENTAGE BUT

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:27.606
AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. THE

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.608
LEGISLATURE RELAX INSTEAD OF

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:31.410
STANDING HELP WHAT WHAT IS THE

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:32.845
PROBLEM EXACTLY HOW WIDESPREAD

02:07:32.911 --> 02:07:34.980
IS IT BUT I JUST. IF THE FREEWAY

02:07:35.047 --> 02:07:36.915
FLYER THING WE'VE GOT GOING ON

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:37.816
ACROSS THE STATE SOME OF OUR

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:38.951
PART TIMERS ARE NOT FREQUENT

02:07:39.018 --> 02:07:41.020
FLYERS RIGHT THEY JUST TEACH ONE

02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:43.489
OR TWO CLASSES BECAUSE- THAT'S

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:44.523
ALL THEY WANT TO TEACH. NOW

02:07:44.590 --> 02:07:45.391
OTHERS. OUR TEACHING TWENTY

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:46.825
UNITS BECAUSE EGYPT. COLLEGES

02:07:46.892 --> 02:07:48.560
RIGHT BOUNCING AROUND EVERY DAY.

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:49.862
SO I DON'T KNOW HOW WE FIGURE

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:52.264
THIS OUT LOGISTICALLY OTHER THAN

02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:55.734
HIRE PEOPLE FULL TIME. THANK YOU

02:07:55.801 --> 02:08:01.273
. OKAY DR CHOI. YUP MYSELF FIVE

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.308
FOR THE PART TIME AS A ADAM

02:08:03.375 --> 02:08:05.944
FACULTY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AT

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:07.379
THE PORCELAIN COLLEGES TO TEACH

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:10.949
KOREAN LANGUAGE- IT WAS OKAY

02:08:11.016 --> 02:08:14.453
BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONE

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:17.656
ONE CLASS- IF WHAT. BERMAN I

02:08:17.723 --> 02:08:19.158
THINK THE BOTTOM LINE OF

02:08:19.224 --> 02:08:22.895
QUESTION IS THAT THE- IF-

02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:25.931
COMMENDATORY JEWS ARE HIRING

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:28.901
PART TIME AT JIM FACTORS T. IS

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:35.474
UP. TO SAVE- UP MONEY FOR PAYING

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:39.244
BENEFITS BY HIRING FOR TIME

02:08:39.311 --> 02:08:42.114
YEAH- IF THIS OF COURSE IS A ONE

02:08:42.181 --> 02:08:44.116
IN ONE LIMITED TOWARDS- THAT'S

02:08:44.183 --> 02:08:48.220
OKAY BUT- IF- FOR EXAMPLE IF I

02:08:48.287 --> 02:08:50.756
THAT WAS SAID IN SPANISH CLASS

02:08:50.823 --> 02:08:53.025
OF WHICH WAS- MORE POPULAR AND

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:54.193
THE MANY COURSES ARE BEING

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:56.428
OFFERED THAN ONE INSTRUCTOR CAN

02:08:56.495 --> 02:08:59.431
TEACH SEVERAL COURSES AND A

02:08:59.498 --> 02:09:02.968
QUALIFIED ENOUGH UP FOR TIME

02:09:03.035 --> 02:09:05.938
STAGGERS. BUT THE I WONDER IF IN

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:09.608
THAT SITUATION HAPPEN IS- YOU

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:11.276
YOU PROVIDE THE FOUR TIME

02:09:11.343 --> 02:09:14.346
OPPORTUNITY FOR MOST QUALIFIED

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:16.415
TO ALMOST A SENIOR PERSON TO

02:09:16.482 --> 02:09:18.984
TAKE CARE OF ALL ONE TWO THREE

02:09:19.051 --> 02:09:22.020
ALL COURSES- I THINK THAT THAT

02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:25.324
IS SO REALLY DESIRABLE- SO THAT

02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:26.892
THAT DEDICATED PERSON CAN

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:29.194
DEVELOP. THAT THE PROGRAM IN

02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:32.798
THAT THE DEPARTMENT- AND EXPAND

02:09:32.865 --> 02:09:35.968
THE WHOLE FREELY- RATHER THAN

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:39.138
HIRING. THREE DIFFERENT UP PART

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:41.373
TIME PEOPLE. FOR IN THE SAME

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.675
DISAPPROVE I THINK THAT IS ALL

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:47.112
SO I THINK OF THE US OF WHAT. WE

02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:55.187
HAVE THE QUESTION THAT THE TIME. DO YOU WANT A RESPONSE THAT

02:09:55.254 --> 02:10:04.930
TECH. YEAH OKAY. WELL. I THINK

02:10:04.997 --> 02:10:07.399
IF YOU TALK TO COLLEGES WILL SAY

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:11.170
THERE'S SOME. REASONS WHY THEY-

02:10:11.236 --> 02:10:12.938
LIKE TO HAVE PART TIME FACULTY

02:10:13.005 --> 02:10:14.540
IT'S SEPARATE FROM SAVING MONEY

02:10:14.606 --> 02:10:16.708
THEY LIKE THE FLEXIBILITY HAVING

02:10:16.775 --> 02:10:17.976
A PART TIME FACULTY THEY'RE NOT

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.678
SURE IF THE HOW MANY COURSES ARE

02:10:19.745 --> 02:10:20.946
GOING TO NEED OR HOW LONG

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:22.848
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:24.516
PROGRAM SO THEY DON'T NEED TO

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:26.385
HAVE- TENURE AND YOU FIND A SPOT

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:29.154
FOR THAT- FACULTY FOR THE NEXT

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:31.523
THIRTY YEARS ALSO YOU CAN GET A

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:33.091
GET EXPERTISE YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:34.726
SOMEBODY IN THE COMMUNITY WHO IS

02:10:34.793 --> 02:10:36.695
AN EXPERT IN A CERTAIN AREA. YU

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:37.896
CAN BRING THEM ON MAYBE THEY

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:39.698
DON'T WANT A FULL TIME JOB AT

02:10:39.765 --> 02:10:40.966
THE COLLEGE BUT THEY'RE WILLING

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:44.703
TO HELP AND TEACH- BUT YOU'RE AT

02:10:44.770 --> 02:10:46.004
THE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THERE

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.207
ARE. REASONS WHY YOU WANT. FULL

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:49.908
TIME FACULTY YOU NEED THE FULL

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:51.877
THE FULL TIME FACULTY FOR THAT

02:10:51.944 --> 02:10:54.513
STABILITY TO BUILD THE PROGRAM

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.982
MAINTAIN THE PROGRAM. WORK ON A

02:10:57.049 --> 02:11:00.452
SERVICE TO THE COLLEGE. AND HI

02:11:00.519 --> 02:11:01.954
ANYONE HIRING DEVELOP THE

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:03.155
CURRICULUM DEVELOP THOSE

02:11:03.222 --> 02:11:06.792
PARTNERSHIPS. WITH INDUSTRY. AND

02:11:06.858 --> 02:11:09.528
SO THAT'S SOMETHING COLLEGES-

02:11:09.595 --> 02:11:11.296
PRODUCT STRUGGLE WITH IS HOW

02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:13.065
MANY PART TIMERS VERSUS HOW MANY

02:11:13.131 --> 02:11:15.500
FULL TIMERS JUSTO HARKEN BACK TO

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:16.768
THE EARLIER ISSUE WE HAD

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:18.437
RECOMMENDED INCREASING BASE

02:11:18.503 --> 02:11:20.739
FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES AND ONE

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:22.341
ONE OF THE- ADVANTAGES OF THAT

02:11:22.407 --> 02:11:23.909
COULD BE YOU MORE MONEY TO THE

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.944
COLLEGES COULD HELP THEM THE

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:26.645
POTENTIALLY HIRE MORE FULL TIME

02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:28.213
FACULTY AND HAVE MORE FULL TIME

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.715
FACULTY IF THAT'S IN FACT WHAT.

02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:31.717
WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST WAY

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:33.252
TO MOVE THERE- PROGRAMS FORWARD

02:11:33.318 --> 02:11:41.593
AND KEEP THOSE PROGRAMS REVISED. THE STRONGLY- RECOMMEND US AND

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:46.598
WHEN. SURE ENOUGH FORCESOUT ONE

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:48.634
PART TIME- PERSON READY AND

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.168
WILLING AND QUALIFIED

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:53.839
INSTRUCTORS- TO WORK ITSELF FOR

THE TIME CAN TAKE CARE OF ALL

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:57.476
THAT THAT POLICIES SO I THINK

02:11:57.542 --> 02:11:59.645
THAT THAT IS A MORE DESIRABLE-

02:11:59.711 --> 02:12:00.879
BECAUSE THAT THAT PERSON MAY

02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:03.048
PACKED AND THE VISIT THREE OF

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:04.783
THE FOUR DIFFERENT ENOUGH BUT

02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:06.485

IS SO CORD BY THE- WEATHER. THE

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:27.105
CAMPER. IS A- WE'RE TRYING. TO-

02:12:27.172 --> 02:12:27.906
IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF UP FOR

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:32.544
TIME JOB THAT THE PROGRAM IS

02:12:32.611 --> 02:12:38.383
THERE ANY- THE CENTRALIZED- WHAT

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:40.085
THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE CAN

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:43.255
SUPERVISE TWO OR OR STUDY WHY DO

THOSE AT THE ANY MONITORING

SAME DISCIPLINE TOO MANY ADS IN

02:12:57.969 --> 02:12:59.538
FACT WAS DISAPPOINTING WHICH

WOULD BE USED AND HOW THE AMOUNT

02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:16.713
WAS- WAS REACHED AND SO WE

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:18.215
RECOMMEND THAT ACTUALLY IS ON

02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:22.286
PAGE THIRTY NINE OF THE- AGENDA

02:39:22.352 --> 02:39:23.120
YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT

02:39:23.186 --> 02:39:25.222

ADDITIONAL MONEY IF IT'S A MULTI

02:39:40.737 --> 02:39:41.872
COLLEGE DISTRICT. ALSO WE THINK

02:39:41.939 --> 02:39:43.807

02:39:47.978 --> 02:39:50.013
REVISED TO THINK THROUGH MORE

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.882

A PRETTY COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL

02:40:06.997 --> 02:40:08.332
STRUCTURE AND JUST THINK THE

LEGISLATURE. COULD USE SOME

02:40:10.200 --> 02:40:11.969

EXACTLY THIS WOULD WORK AND

02:40:14.638 --> 02:40:16.139
WHAT'S OF DIVISION OF LABOR. BOB

02:40:16.206 --> 02:40:18.241

OFFICE COPE WITH AN ALLOCATION.

02:40:32.556 --> 02:40:33.490
METHODOLOGY THAT ADDRESSES NOT

02:40:33.557 --> 02:40:35.659
JUST THE- ENROLLMENT OF THE SIZE

02:40:35.726 --> 02:40:37.828

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.696
CURRENT LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS

02:40:39.763 --> 02:40:41.198

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:50.107
THERE ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT

02:40:50.173 --> 02:40:52.509
LEVELS OF PREPAREDNESS. SO HOW

02:40:52.576 --> 02:40:53.710
MANY CHANCES OFFICE REALLY

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:55.879

EVEN AS JUST LAST MONTH. ANOTHER

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:15.258
DISTRICT EXPERIENCED A CYBER

02:42:15.325 --> 02:42:17.694
SECURITY ATTACK. MODERNIZING

02:42:17.761 --> 02:42:18.862
STATE AND DISTRICT LEVEL

02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:20.997
TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:23.600
AND CCC APPLY ARE CRITICAL TO

02:42:23.667 --> 02:42:26.002
ENSURE. FACULTY AND STUDENTS

02:42:26.069 --> 02:42:27.704
SENSITIVE DATA ARE PROTECTED

02:42:27.771 --> 02:42:29.840
FROM THESE ATTACKS WE ALSO

02:42:29.906 --> 02:42:31.708
RECOGNIZE THAT DATA CHALLENGES

02:42:31.775 --> 02:42:33.910
AND LIMITED TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY

02:42:33.977 --> 02:42:36.713
RISK. UNDERMINING A KEY REFORMS

02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:38.748
THAT ADVANCE STUDENT SUCCESS.

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:40.050
THE PROPOSED ACKNOWLEDGING

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:41.518
SECURITY INVESTMENTS ARE TWO

02:42:41.585 --> 02:42:44.087
FOLD RELYING ON STATE AND LOCAL

02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:46.723
ACTION. WELL SMALL PORTION WOULD

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:48.191
BE USED FOR ONGOING SOFTWARE

02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:50.527
CARS COST. THE MAJORITY WILL

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:52.596
SUPPORT ON GOING MODERATE-

02:42:52.662 --> 02:42:55.165
MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTATION.

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:57.534
STATE LEVEL ACTIONS ARE FOR

02:42:57.601 --> 02:42:59.603
ACCOUNTABILITY MONITORING

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.771
TAILORING SUPPORT FOR DISTRICTS-

02:43:01.838 --> 02:43:04.908
PRIOR- THOUGH NOT EXCLUSIVELY-

02:43:04.975 --> 02:43:06.943
BUT MOSTLY TARGETING ON THOSE

02:43:07.010 --> 02:43:09.312
SMALLER LESS MATURE. TECHNOLOGY

02:43:09.379 --> 02:43:10.780
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS AT

02:43:10.847 --> 02:43:12.682
CERTAIN DISTRICTS. IT'S

02:43:12.749 --> 02:43:14.284
IMPORTANT THAT THESE OPTIONS AND

02:43:14.351 --> 02:43:16.820
UPGRADES NOT BE DONE IN A SILO.

02:43:16.887 --> 02:43:18.755
WE MUST TACKLE GROWING

02:43:18.822 --> 02:43:21.091
TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND RISK AND

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:22.659
THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT AND

02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:25.428
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES- EFFORTS BY

02:43:25.495 --> 02:43:28.565
BAD ACTORS BECOME MORE

02:43:28.632 --> 02:43:29.866
SOPHISTICATED. SECOND WE MUST

02:43:29.933 --> 02:43:31.201
AND IMPROVE THE STUDENT USER

02:43:31.268 --> 02:43:33.537
EXPERIENCE AND REDESIGN CCC

02:43:33.603 --> 02:43:35.539
APPLY THIS IS A COMPLEX

02:43:35.605 --> 02:43:38.775
ENDEAVOR- THAT SO THAT WE CAN

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:39.943
ENSURE THAT WE COLLECT THE DATA

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:42.012
THAT WE NEED FROM STUDENTS BUT

02:43:42.078 --> 02:43:42.946
WE ALSO DON'T MAKE THE

02:43:43.013 --> 02:43:45.048

02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:46.816
STUDENTS AND PROSPECTIVE

02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:48.919
STUDENTS STOP MIDWAY THROUGH. SO

02:43:48.985 --> 02:43:51.087
THE EFFORT IS REALLY GOING TO BE

02:43:51.154 --> 02:43:52.556
A DELICATE AND URGENT BALANCE OF

02:43:52.622 --> 02:43:55.525
ART AND SCIENCE SO AGAIN WE

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:57.360
