NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- ON ENERGY ISSUES- AND ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND A AND YOU FOR THE HARD WORK MISTER CHAIR ON THIS MEASURE- AND- AND REALLY PLEASED AT THE REFINEMENTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER ON TO A AND I ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AS OPPOSED. TO BEING ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS LAST YEAR IN IN YOUR BILL MISTER CHAIR A. B. TEN FIFTY FOR THE LEGISLATURE IMPOSED STRICT CONDITIONS ON P. JEANNIE TO EXERT BANG THREE. AS A TRANSFORM UTILITY SB THREE FIFTY HOLDS P. JEANNIE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND PROVIDES OUR STATE WITH FAIL SAFE IN NEW PEACH IN A FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. SB THREE FIFTY AUTHORIZES THE CREATION OF A NEW ENTITY GOLDEN STATE ENERGY AND NON PROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION WHICH WOULD STEP IN AND TAKE OVER IF PGP FAILS TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY OR- IF P. JEANNIE FAILS TO TRANSFORM AS REQUIRED BY AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR. IT THREE FIFTY IS A BILL I HOPE WE NEVER NEED. BECAUSE IF FIFTY IS TRIGGER IT WOULD MEAN P. JEANNIE HAS FAILED US ONCE AGAIN. I WILL GO INTO A LONG DISCUSSION OF P. GENIES FAILINGS. WE HAVE ALL WITH THEM. FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS FOR FAR TOO MANY TIMES HAVING THE- CALIFORNIA DESERVES A REFORM TO P. JEANNIE. I HOPE PGD NEVER STARTS ANOTHER WILDFIRE BECAUSE ANOTHER PIPELINE EXPLOSION. I HOPE WE ALL HOPE. THE P. JEANNIE IMPROVES ITS SAFETY RECORD AND IT'S ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ALL HOPE PGD FOR FILLS ITS COMMITMENT TO TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO A SAFE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE IN RESILIENT UTILITY. BUT OUR STATE CANNOT RELY ON HOPE A LOW. SB THREE FIFTY IS OUR CONTINGENCY PLAN. SHOULD THE NEED ARISE SB THREE FIFTY ENSURE THAT OUR STATE CAN TAKE STRONG AND SWIFT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS INCLUDING IF ULTIMATELY NECESSARY THE CPUC REVOCATION OF P. GENIES A LICENSE TO OPERATE. SB THREE FIFTY AND I CAN'T AND CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR WILD FIRE VICTIMS SHOULD P. JEANNIE FAIL TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY THE PATH LAID OUT IN SB THREE FIFTY IS THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO RESOLVE THE VICTIMS SETTLEMENTS AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IN THE ACCEPTED ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS MAKE CLEAR. HOW JESSE FIFTY ISN'T A BILL WE WANT WHAT WE WANT IS FOR P. GINNY TO BE A REFORMED UTILITY. BUT IT IS A BILL WE NEED. TO PROTECT P. GENIES RATE PAYERS. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO THE PROPER TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE WILL HAVE ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. AND WE WILL HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. OF THEIR WILL TESTIFY FROM THE BACK OF THE CHAMBER FLOOR. AND THERE WILL BE THREE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES THAT WILL WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WORK ON A LOT OF HUNTERS HERE I JUST WANTED TO- THANK- THE AUTHOR OF THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF AND THINK THE- THE MEMBERS OF THE ROUNDTABLE THAT WORK WITH OFTEN PARTNERSHIP- FOR SO MANY MONTHS ON- RESOLUTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY IN A MANNER THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA FOR. SAFETY WITH A SAFE RELIABLE- CLEAN POWER VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE PARTNERSHIP AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH WORKING TOGETHER. FOR A BETTER OUTCOME FOR CALIFORNIA HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND- ALL I GOT. THANK ANOTHER CALL ON A GOT WHICH WITH THE I. B. LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MEMBER SCOTT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND IBEW LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE REPRESENTING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OF THE PACIFIC GAS ELECTRIC COMPANY. AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WE HAVE STEADFASTLY OPPOSED ANY BREAK UP HE PROPOSED BREAK UP OF- PGD. WHAT IS CHANGED TODAY IS THAT. IN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR STAFF AND WITH THE AUTHOR. IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL PROCESS. THEY DEVELOPED A- SMACK IN ISM IF WARRANTED TO CREATE AN ENTITY THAT IS THE ONLY IT'S A T. THE ONLY PROPOSED INTO T. SUCCESSOR ENTITY TO PGD. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PROTECT THE PENSION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS OF THOSE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS THAT I REPRESENT. NEITHER THE SCOTT SENATOR WIENER PROPOSAL. NEAT NOR THE MAYOR OF SAN JOSE'S PROPOSAL. CAN ACCOMPLISH THOSE TWO THINGS FOR A MANY. ISSUES RELATED TO FEDERAL LABOR LAW AS WELL AS MANY ISSUES OF JUST PRACTICALITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND URGENT I'VE A THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW TURN TO THE THREE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES THAT WOULD LIKE TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS OF PHONE MODERATOR- WILL CALL ON SAN JOSE MAYOR SAM LICCARDO YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. AT THE CHAIRPERSON HOLDEN THAT BREAKING MEMBER PATTERSON THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDER MY THOUGHTS. EVERY LEADERSHIP IN THIS DIFFICULT MOMENT- I HAVE MADE YOU KNOW LARGER WE ASSEMBLED A COALITION OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED ELECTED LOCAL OFFICIALS REPRESENT MORE THAN NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. ARE URGING TRANSFORMATION P. JEANNIE BECOME A MORE RESPONSE RESPONSIBLE. CONSTRUCT MORE ON UTILITY WE APPLAUD SENATOR HILL OF THE SPONSORS OF SB THREE FIFTY FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS. TO EMBRACE THE NONPROFIT CORPORATE FORM FOR WHICH A COALITION AS LONG ADVOCATED. TO ALTER THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST PREVAILS OVER SHAREHOLDER INTEREST. OUR COALITION HAS CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZED THE SECOND GOAL HOWEVER COULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR THIS UTILITY EVERY DOLLAR INTEREST TOLD. PAY THE HEDGE FOR THE HIGH YIELD DEBT WITH THE PRIVATE OF RESOURCE NEEDS TO INVEST. KATIE RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL POST HIGHER RATED ON CUSTOMERS WELL WE CAN YOU TELL THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY. AT CENTER THE UTILITY WILL REQUIRE ANOTHER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT HALF DECADE FOR OVER TWO SAFETY RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS. A FEW DOZEN BASIS POINTS OF INTEREST WILL COST REPAIRS AND RESIDENTS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND BILLIONS KIMBERLY. ALL THE MANY CONVERSATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND EXPERT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS REINFORCE THE BASIC CONCLUSION THAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS WILL PUNISH GOLDEN STATE IN THE POLL FORM OF HIGHER FINANCING COSTS. TO WHATEVER EXTENT APPEARS TO BE VULNERABLE TO POLITICAL OR REGULATORY RISK FINANCIAL MARKETS RESPOND TO REST BY RAISING PRICES THAT IS THE COST OF CAPITAL. I THE SITE PRINCIPAL FOR TWO REASONS IN MY CONCLUSION FIRST A MANAGED OPPOSE THE SB THREE FIFTY TO ADD PERMANENT BOARD MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WILL DIRECTLY RESULT. IN HIGHER COSTS TO RATEPAYERS WITHOUT COMMENSURATE BENEFIT RELIABILITY SHAKE YOUR SERVICE QUALITY. SECOND WE URGE THE CREATION AN ENTITY WITH THE WAY THAT TAUGHT IN THE X. RAY THAT PARTY THE ABILITY THAT ENTITY TO CONTROL ITS RATE. CAPITAL STRUCTURE IS THE HALLMARK OF MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED CUSTOMERS UTILITY QUALQUER THROUGHOUT THE NATION. WE EMBRACE REGULATION ICPC. OUR STATE AGENCIES OVER SUCH ISSUES AT STAKE THE LABOR BY NOW STANDARD CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. BUT NOT. WE CERTAINLY HAVE LET. DESIRE TO MAKE STATE CALIBER PUBLIC WHICH BE ASSURED BY TOPIC MARYLAND MUTUAL. CORP ARE STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE LONG URGED I THINK YOU GIVING USING USE OF OUR- AND BY THE WAY WE HAVE.

THE CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE THREE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR THE SUPPORTING WITNESS- AS YOU MAY KNOW MY DISTRICT AS A LOT OF P. JEANNIE EMPLOYEES. IT'S THE LARGEST EMPLOYER MY DISTRICT A WE ALSO HAVE WILD FIRE ISSUES NOTHING OF THE LIKES THAT HAS BEEN SEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MIND YOU BUT- IT'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK SO- MY FIRST QUESTION IS I UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS ENTITY WOULD ASSUME THE LABOR CONTRACTS OF THE EXISTING WORKERS BUT MY READ OF THE BILLS THAT'S ONLY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND I'M WONDERING- IF THE WITNESS COULD ADDRESS WHY THAT IS AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. MY SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT SPECIFIC MECHANISMS. EXCUSE ME EXIST TO PROTECT VICTIMS IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE. A FUTURE FIRES UNDER THE GOLDEN STATE ENTITY CONTRACT- A CONSTRUCT AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS WHETHER THE AUTHOR. EVER CONSIDERED A- AT A SUNSET PROVISION. AND BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING NOVEL OCCURS MEETS. DIFFERENT KIND OF HYBRID MODEL HASN'T REALLY BEEN TRIED BEFORE AND WONDERING IF THERE MIGHT BE MERIT IN THE EVENT THAT IS NECESSARY- THIS BILL WOULD TAKE EFFECT. IT MIGHT BE WORTH CONSIDERING SOME SORT OF SUNSET SO APPRECIATE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM V. HAVE FIRST QUESTION IT GOES TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE MINDERS. THE TERM OF THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. WITH THE I. B. D. W. WORKERS AND THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER CONTRACT AFTER THAT- INTO AND IF I AM INCORRECT IN THESE- MIGHT WITNESS CAN CERTAINLY- AND I WOULD APPRECIATE HER SUPPORT AND THAT. THE WILDFIRES EIGHT EIGHT FIVE REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE ISSUES OF WILDFIRES COMING. FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. IN OTHER AREAS THAT WILL BE- CERTAINLY. THE EFFORT IN THE LIABILITY THAT COMES FROM THAT. WILL GO TO THE NEW ENTITY GOLDEN STATE ENERGY. WHERE AS THEY DON'T HAVE SHAREHOLDER IT WOULD HAVE- BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE GOLDEN STATE IT. NOT IN AT THE RATE OF RETURN THE TEN AND A HALF PERCENT OR THE BILLION. TO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN SHAREHOLDER OFFICE. THOSE AND IT'S NO LONGER PAYING ANY STATE INCOME TAX. WILL BE MY THERE THAT COULD BE USED FOR WILDFIRES AND IT WILL ALSO BE PART OF THE WILD- OR FOR THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THIS. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR MOVING FORWARD TO UP TO TEST. THIS IF THE- WHITE FOR FIRE. IN TERMS OF A- I GUESS THE CHALLENGE THE THAT I WAS STRUGGLING WITH ON THAT HE IS THE GENIE IS WRITTEN. UNDER YOUR. SOLD UP. AND THIRD LATE LIFE IT'S A CHANGES THAT I THE ENERGY OF TWO WHEN LEADERS CHANGE IT BECAME MUCH MORE. MUCH OF INTEREST IN THE BOTTOM LINE THEN THE POWER LINE AND THAT REALLY BECAME I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR THE UTILITY THAT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE FOR US OR OUR. TEN YEARS FROM NOW FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW BECAUSE IT COULD OCCUR IN TRUSTING THE P. YOU SEE TODAY AS I DO WHERE I DID NOT TEN YEARS AGO I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THIS WOULD ONLY BE USED IF NECESSARY IN UNDER THE- THE STRICTEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD WARRANT A MAJOR SHIFT. CHANGE FROM AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY BUT PUBLIC BENEFIT NONPROFIT CORPORATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE SHOULD. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF. MAYES JUST A FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT YOU'D SAID AT THE BEGINNING THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT YOU HOPED WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO USE BUT IT'S THERE IF WE NEEDED A P. JEANNIE DOESN'T COME COME OUT OF BANKRUPTCY IS THIS THE ONLY ENTITY OR COULD THERE BE COULD THIS BODY COME UP WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM- FOR INSTANCE IF THEY DIDN'T COME OUT OF A BANKRUPTCY COULD YOU NEED THE SERVICE THESE INTO. TWO DID DIFFERENT AREA OR IS THIS THE ONLY MODEL WELL THIS IS THE THIS IS THE MODEL THAT HAS BEEN CREATED STE STE- THAT IN THE EVENT THAT WANTED TO EXIT. DOESN'T CHECK FINE EIGHTEEN AS- I SEPTEMBER THIRD WHEN THE BAY. COULD THE EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IS GOING FORWARD AND THE CHILD. THAT THEY COULD FACE IN THE FUTURE IF THEY- PLACE THEMSELVES IN THE SAME PRECARIOUS POSITION THAT THEY HAVE IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE IN TERMS OF. THE VERSION OF RESOURCES FROM. SAFETY FROM OPERATIONS TO PROFITS IN AND- BONUSES AND EXECUTIVES IF THAT IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR AGAIN. IN THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR THIS TO OF TO TRANSITION INTO SOMETHING THAT- THAT I THINK WOULD BE WARRANTED I DON'T. THINK THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IF P. JEANNIE FAILS AT ANY ONE OF THOSE JUNCTURES. AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE P. IT TO A RECEIVER THAT WOULD BE APPOINTED BY THE P. YOU SEE PERHAPS BY THE COURTS THE RECEIVER WITHIN LOOK AT OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIGHTS STAY ON. IN THE P. JEANNIE SIR AREA AND THAT THE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO FUNCTION. CERTAINLY WITH OUR LEGISLATION TODAY AND HOPEFULLY WITH YOUR VOTE TODAY THAT WILL MOVE THIS GOLDEN STATE ENTERED INTO A POSITION THAT IT IS. IT EIGHT. TWO NIMBLY TAKEOVER THAT OPERATION THROUGH EITHER EMINENT DOMAIN OR THROUGH A THROUGH A PURCHASE BECAUSE OF THE AYE BANK FINANCING THAT'S AVAILABLE. WILL BE ABLE TO BE THAT THAT INITIAL. THE BEST POSITION IN ALL. FOR THE RATE PAYERS AND CAL. THAT DOESN'T SAY THAT THERE WILL BE SOMEONE. LONG THE. A COMPANY THAT ANOTHER MISTER TO TAILOR MADE TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE. IN THE COMPANY THAT HAPPEN AS WELL BUT WILL BE IN A- THAT I PUT WILL. THE BEST SIR IN THE US. TO BE THAT SAFE YOU. GO FOR BUT THAT DOES NOT WE'RE NOT ONLY GAME IN TOWN. IN THE FUTURE. THE OTHER MEMBERS CHECK YOUR CODE. I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS- I WANNA THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN AND SENATOR HILL ON PUTTING THIS BILL TOGETHER. I'VE ALL THE WORK THE OF THE OFFICE OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF LEGISLATIVE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO LET OUR WORK GROUP ON THE P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY. I HOPE THIS SUCCESS DEMONSTRATES BUT TO THE DAM AND MINISTRATION THE VALUE OF WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THIS CLOSELY ON IMPORTANT POLICY INITIATIVES. WE WERE MINDFUL WE WERE THOUGHTFUL. THESE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL AND PROVIDE OUR STATE WITH THE NECESSARY PLAN B. PUBLIC UTILITY OPTION. SHOULD P. GINNY AGAIN FAILED TO MEET ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. MOVING FORWARD. I'M MOST CONCERNED ABOUT WORLD FOR VICTIMS AND REPAIRS IT P. GINNY CONTINUES TO EXIST VICTIMS OF THE WILDFIRES COST BY P. GINNY MUST BE IMMEDIATELY AND FAIRLY COMPENSATED. FOR THE PAIN AND LOSS EVEN. IN ADDITION IF THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT THE P. YOU SEE MUST BE DILIGENT IN ASSURING THAT P. GINNY SHAREHOLDERS ACTUALLY SHARE THE BURDEN OF THE LIABILITY. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES P. GINNY HAS IGNORED OR MISMATCH FOR DECADES. LET'S REMEMBER REPAIRS DID NOT CAUSE THIS MESS. THEY SHOULD NOT AGAIN SHOULDER THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF REFORMING P. GINNY PRACTICE IN MANAGEMENT IN THE SECOND BANKRUPTCY IN JUST TWENTY YEARS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JOIN YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON SB THREE FIFTY. FIVE STRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE HAVE A PLAN B. SHOULD PGA ANY.
