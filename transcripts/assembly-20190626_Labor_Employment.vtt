00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.044
I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SB

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.045
ONE SEVENTY ONE IT'S A BILL VERY

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.180
SIMILAR TO A BILL THIS COMMITTEE

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.282
ACTUALLY SAW LAST YEAR.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.583
IT'S A BILL TO FIGHT PAY

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.819
DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA.

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.454
WITH INFORMATION.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.122
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO PAY A

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.290
QUICK EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:14.526
MINORITIES WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:15.727
DON'T KNOW.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:18.229
IT WILL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS WITH A

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.097
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES ARE MORE

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:22.000
SHOVEL FAIRLY ROBUST COMPANY. TO

MORE -- EXCUSE ME TO SUBMIT A

00:28:24.135 --> 00:28:26.604
PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:28.406
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.374
AND HOUSING.

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.176
OUTLINING THE COMPENSATION AN

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.678
HOUR'S WORK TO OF EMPLOYEES BY

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:34.846
GENDER.

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:38.016
RACE ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY.

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:40.318
AND THE GOAL IS TWO FOLD FIRST

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:42.654
TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.390
ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY PRACTICES

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:48.126
AND ALLOW FOR SELF CORRECTION.

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:49.894
PUT THAT MIRROR IN FRONT OF YOUR

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:52.230
FACE AND SHE JUST EXACTLY WHAT

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:53.364
YOU'RE DOING.

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:54.599
AND IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:57.469
THAT IS UNLAWFUL OR CREATES DIS

00:28:57.535 --> 00:29:00.638
DESPARD WORKING OPPORTUNITIES

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.173
MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.374
NOBODY ELSE HAS TO REALLY KNOW

00:29:03.441 --> 00:29:04.943
ABOUT IT YOU FILE YOUR ANNUAL

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:06.444
REPORT.

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:08.279
YOU MAKE THE CORRECTIONS AND YOU

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:10.648
OF ACCOMPLISH WHAT THIS BILL IS

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:11.883
DESIGNED TO DO.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.952
AND NUMBER TWO IT WILL ALLOW THE

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.386
DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:17.088
AND HOUSING TOGETHER IMPORTANT

00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:18.790
DATA THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:21.159
PATTERNS OF WAGE DISPARITIES IF

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:22.694
THEY EXIST.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.429
AND IF THEY NOTICED DEVIATIONS

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:26.631
OR OUT LIARS TO BE ABLE TO

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:28.766
INVESTIGATE FURTHER AGAIN WITH

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:31.803
THE HOPE THAT IF COMPANIES SEE

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.671
THAT THEY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:35.473
WITH OUR FAIR PAY LAWS.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.509
AND WHERE THERE'S DISPARITY IN

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.978
INCOME AND JOB SEGREGATION THAT

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:42.480
THEY WILL MAKE THOSE CORRECTIONS

00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:46.718
IN IT ESSENTIALLY AN INCENTIVIZE

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:47.819
BUT REALLY VOLUNTARY WAY.

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:49.621
SO THE INFORMATION THEN WOULD

00:29:49.687 --> 00:29:50.755
ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:52.490
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:55.260
ENFORCEMENT IF THEY REQUESTED.

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:56.961
THE BILL IS CLOSELY MODELED

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:59.797
ACTUALLY AFTER EFFORTS THAT HAVE

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:02.333
BEEN MADE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.801
<u>&lt;c.red&gt; SHOULD SAY PRE TRUMP.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:05.470
NOT RECOGNIZING THAT UNEQUAL PAY

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.906
IS OFTEN HIDDEN TO EMPLOYERS AND

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.474
EMPLOYEES THE OBAMA

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.276
ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.645
PROPER PROPOSED REVISION TO A

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.180
DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT.

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:16.414
THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.449
SUBMITTING FOR MORE THAN FIFTY

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.651
YEARS.

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.386
IT'S THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION

00:30:21.452 --> 00:30:24.122
REPORT KNOWN AS THE E. E. O..

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:25.557
ONE AN AIDE EXPANDED IT TO

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:26.925
INCLUDE THE REPORTING OF PAY

00:30:26.991 --> 00:30:29.561
DATA BY RACE AND GENDER

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.095
BEGINNING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.031
SIMPLY EXPANDING REPORT THE

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:33.865
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING FOR

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:34.666
YEARS.

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:36.234
SO IT'S NOTHING NEW IT JUST

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.636
SIMPLY ADDS TWO CATEGORIES RACE

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:39.604
AND GENDER.

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:42.006
BUT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.441
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:45.577
EQUAL PAY EFFORTS BACK BY

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.345
PUTTING A WHOLE TO THIS NEW RULE.

00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:49.380
THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:50.848
SUIT.

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.016
ARGUING THAT THE OFFICE OF

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.685
MANAGEMENT BUDGET LACKED A GOOD

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.820
CAUSE TO STAY THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.222
OF PAY DATA COLLECTION.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:59.190
BUT IN MARCH A FEDERAL JUDGE

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:01.826
ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.628
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH COLLECTING

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.929
THIS IMPORTANT DATA.

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:07.465
CITING THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.100
STUDY AND IN PORT THERE WENT

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.568
INTO THE CREATION OF THIS DATA

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:12.203
REVISION.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.304
AND DECLARING THE OFFICE OF

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:15.840
MANAGEMENT BUDGETS DECISION TO

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:17.275
HALT THE PROGRAMME.

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:20.712
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS.

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:21.779
SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER HEARD

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:22.947
ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.082
I'M SURE.

00:31:24.148 --> 00:31:25.583
BUT IN THIS CASE THE COURT

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.252
ACTUALLY MADE A RULING.

00:31:27.318 --> 00:31:29.721
AND THIS DISH DECISION MAY BE

00:31:29.787 --> 00:31:31.122
APPEALED BUT NONE THE LESS THE

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.924
COLLECTION OF THIS IDENTICAL

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:34.892
PAID OUT OF REQUESTED UNDER THIS

00:31:34.959 --> 00:31:35.493
BILL.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.362
IS NOW UNDER WAY AT THE FEDERAL

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.831
LEVEL IN SB ONE SEVENTY ONE WILL

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:42.066
ENSURE THIS DATA IS ALSO IN THE

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.335
HANDS OF OUR STATE AGENCIES.

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:46.537
AN EMPLOYER MAY COMPLY WITH THIS

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:47.839
BE ONE SEVENTY ONE BY SIMPLY

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:52.277
SUBMITTING TO THE STATE A COPY

00:31:52.343 --> 00:31:53.778
OF THEIR E. O. ONE FORM.

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:54.579
THIS IS ABOUT AS EASY AS IT GETS

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:55.546
TO COMPLY.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.315
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BASED ON

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:59.217
SOME OF THE INFO --

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:01.219
MISINFORMATION OUT -- FOR TO

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.787
KNOW WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT.

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:06.658
IT IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC EXPOSURE.

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:08.226
OR TRAINING.

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:09.594
SOME MIGHT THINK THIS WOULD BE A

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.229
GOOD IDEA AND I DON'T

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:12.730
NECESSARILY DISAGREE.

00:32:12.797 --> 00:32:15.066
BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT WE NEED TO

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:17.335
QUITE GET THERE AT LEAST AT THIS

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:19.237
FIRST POINT PRELIMINARILY IT MAY

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:20.772
BE SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO GOING

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:21.506
FORWARD.

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.207
BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT MOST OF

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.176
THESE COMPANIES DON'T COMPLY

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:26.911
WITH THE LAW SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.246
DON'T KNOW ALL.

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.881
AND NOT THAT IT'S INTENTIONAL

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:31.649
THAT MAY BE WRONG BUT I'M

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:33.318
WILLING TO GIVE IT A CHANCE AND

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:35.219
SO THIS BILL REALLY ISN'T ABOUT

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.721
INCENTIVES.

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.423
ARE THIS BILL WILL NOT EXPOSE

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.158
INFORMATION THAT IS INDIVIDUALLY

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.694
IDENTIFIABLE BY BUSINESSES NOR

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.796
WILL EXPOSE EMPLOYEES PRIVATE

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:46.898
FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO THE

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:47.932
PUBLIC.

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.867
I'VE EVEN TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:51.803
OF PROHIBITING A PUBLIC RECORD

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:54.038
ACT DISCLOSURE.

00:32:54.105 --> 00:32:56.040
SO AGAIN MY GOAL HERE IS TO GET

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:59.577
COMPLIANCE AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.012
THIS WILL BE.

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.114
AS EFFECTIVE AWAY AND IF NOT

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:05.249
FRANKLY I'M PREPARED TO TO MAKE

00:33:05.316 --> 00:33:07.952
SURE THAT THERE IS A HARSHER

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:09.721
STICK -- THAN THE CARROT THAT

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.389
WERE OFFERING THE LIMITING OF

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:12.857
PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF THE

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:14.659
REPORTS IS SIMILAR TO ACTUALLY

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.227
WHAT OCCURS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:18.129
WHERE THEY'VE HAD NO ISSUES WITH

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:19.764
ON TOWARD DISCLOSURE OF THIS

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:20.565
DATA.

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.667
IN THE FIFTY PLUS YEARS SINCE

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.602
THIS OP FORM IS BEEN REQUIRED.

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.771
BUT WHAT THE DATA WILL PROVIDE

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.439
AS I MENTION IS A BIRD'S-EYE

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:30.141
VIEW TO PAY DISPARITIES AND

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.310
OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION.

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.644
BUT IT DOESN'T DO IT IN A

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:35.747
GRANULAR WAY SO YOU CAN IDENTIFY

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:37.615
ANY PARTICULAR PERSON THE

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:40.151
INFORMATION HERE IS NOT INTENDED

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:42.019
AND CANNOT BE USED TO ENFORCE

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.589
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PAY ACT.

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:45.957
AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT LARGER

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:48.760
CATEGORIES FROM THE THIRTY

00:33:48.826 --> 00:33:50.461
THOUSAND POINT OF FOOD VIEW.

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:51.963
AND THE KIND OF INFORMATION.

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.998
ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.833
BONA FIDE REASONS FOR PAYING ONE

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.235
EMPLOYING MORE THAN ANOTHER

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:59.604
ISN'T ASKED FOR IN THIS REPORT.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.973
EMPLOYERS WILL NOT BE EXPOSED IN

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:03.708
THAT MANNER I KNOW WE'VE HEARD

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.543
OLD THE SKY IS FALLING IT IS NOT

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.744
THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE EO ONE

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:08.246
FORM FOR YEARS.

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.214
THIS IS A TOOL TO SHED LIGHT ON

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:12.417
TRENDS AND THE BIG PICTURE.

THE GAP IN JOB SEGREGATION THAT

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.228
WE KNOW EXISTS BUT HOPEFULLY

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:25.430
COMPANIES WHEN THEY SEE IT

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:26.664
EXISTING WITHIN THEIR OWN

GONNA FOCUS MY TESTIMONY A

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:15.546
LITTLE BIT ON THE BACKGROUND

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.814
ABOUT HOW THIS BILL CAME ABOUT

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:17.882
AND WHY IT WILL HELP ADDRESS

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.016
SOME OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:20.818
FACTORS. TO THIS GENDER AND

00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:22.153
RACIAL WAGE GAP THAT WE SEE

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.522
PERSISTING OVERTIME AND CLOSING

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.823
AT A VERY SLOW PACE.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.225
FIRST I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:28.893
THE EXTENSIVE STUDY AN ANALYSIS

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.561
THAT WENT INTO THE FEDERAL RULE

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.796
THAT SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED.

00:35:31.863 --> 00:35:33.798
THE PROCESS STARTED BACK IN

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.099
TWENTY TEN WHEN THE EOC JOINED

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:36.501
OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES TO

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.069
IDENTIFY WAYS TO IMPROVE

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.637
ENFORCEMENT OF OUR FEDERAL PAY

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.005
DISCRIMINATION LAWS.

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:42.139
THEY ENGAGE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY

00:35:42.206 --> 00:35:44.008
OF SCIENCES TO ISSUE A REPORT

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.443
THAT THAT BASICALLY RECOGNIZE

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.211
ENFORCEMENT VALUE OF COLLECTING

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.946
THIS KIND OF PAY DATA BROKEN

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.681
DOWN BY SEX RACE AND ETHNICITY --

00:35:50.748 --> 00:35:52.650
THE EOC ENGAGE IN A FIVE YEAR

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.485
VALUATION PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.420
PUBLIC COMMENT CONSULTATION WITH

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.356
STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS A PILOT

00:35:58.422 --> 00:35:59.657
STUDY AND THEY CAME OUT WITH

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:01.259
SOME TECHNICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:02.793
AS TO THE MOST AFFECTED PAY DATA

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:03.494
TO COLLECT.

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:04.629
AND THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:06.163
IT TO CREATE THE LEAST BURDEN ON

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.532
EMPLOYERS SO THAT'S WHAT WENT

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:08.833
INTO THIS FORM THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.701
BILL NOW IS IS -- BASED ON THIS

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:12.637
CALIFORNIA BILL SO WHY IS THE

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:13.905
INFORMATION IMPORTANT WHEN WE

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.373
TALK ABOUT EQUAL PAY WERE OFTEN

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:17.108
TALKING ABOUT ONE WOMAN AND ONE

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:19.010
MAN OR ONE PERSON OF ONE RACE

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:19.810
AND ONE PERSON ANOTHER RACE.

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:21.312
PERFORMING SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:22.580
WORK BUT BEING PAID DIFFERENT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:24.148
AMOUNTS AND THAT IS A VERY

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:25.550
COMMON PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW IT

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:27.752
EXISTS -- BUT ANOTHER PROBLEM

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.220
THAT ISN'T SO DISCUSSES THIS

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.187
ISSUE THAT CENTER JACKSON

00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:32.023
MENTIONED OF OCCUPATIONAL

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.691
SEGREGATION WHERE BY WOMEN AND

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:34.992
PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE OFTEN

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:36.260
PREDOMINATED IN OVER

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:36.994
CONCENTRATED.

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:38.296
IN LOWER PAYING OCCUPATIONS

00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:40.364
WITHIN A COMPANY OR EVEN ACROSS

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:41.132
AN INDUSTRY.

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:42.800
ON THIS CAN BE DUE TO A VARIETY

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.001
OF FACTORS SOMETIMES UNCONSCIOUS

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:46.837
BIAS A RECRUITING HIRING AND

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:47.738
PROMOTION PRACTICES AND OTHER

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:48.906
STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:53.477
EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES MAY NOT

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.712
EVEN BE AWARE.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:56.047
EXIST WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES SO

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.048
AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS TYPE OF PAY

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:58.015
DATA THIS HIGH LEVEL DATA WILL

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:58.783
HELP COMPANIES IDENTIFY THESE

00:36:58.849 --> 00:36:59.884
TRENDS THAT ARE OFTEN UNDETECTED

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.218
AND THEN TAKES STEPS TO CHANGE

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:03.254
THEIR COURSE -- THEY MIGHT NOT

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:03.888
NECESSARILY SHOWN EQUAL PAY ACT

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.756
VIOLATION BUT THEY WILL PROMPT

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:06.991
COMPANIES POTENTIALLY CHANGE

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.326
THEIR PAY PROMOTION HIRING

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:09.894
PRACTICES TO BETTER REPRESENT

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.362
WORKERS AT ALL LEVELS OF PAY

00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:12.563
WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.931
BUSINESS IS A RECOGNIZE THE

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:15.399
UTILITY OF DOING THIS WE'VE SEEN

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.701
A LOT OF EXAMPLES IN THE PUBLIC

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.469
OF BIG COMPANIES INCLUDING SALES

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.771
FORCE THE GAP STARBUCKS NAME A

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:21.238
FEW.

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.440
THAT ARE VOLUNTARILY DONE THESE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.008
TYPES OF AUDITS FOUND THESE

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.676
DISPARITIES AND THEN MADE

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:26.410
CHANGES WITHIN THERE'S THEIR

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.878
INTERNAL PAY SYSTEMS TO BETTER

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.347
REPRESENT PEOPLE AT ALL AT ALL

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:30.348
LEVELS.

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:32.183
AND IN FACT EARLIER THIS YEAR

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.651
THIRTEEN COMPANIES PLEDGED TOOK

00:37:33.718 --> 00:37:35.052
THE CALIFORNIA PAY EQUAL PAY

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:36.587
PLEDGING COMMITTED TO DOING THIS

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.456
TYPE OF AUDIT VOLUNTARILY O WE

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.925
SEE THAT BUSINESSES HAVE.

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:41.525
UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:42.326
THIS HAVE BY THE AUDIT AND WHAT

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:43.427
IT CAN REALLY SHOW THEM ABOUT

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:45.863
THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND THEN

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.664
FINALLY IT GIVES A D. F. E. H.

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:48.065
MORE DATA WITH WHICH THEY CAN DO

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:50.167
EVALUATIONS ANALYSES OF PAY

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:51.636
WITHIN A COMPANY BUT ALSO ACROSS

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:52.737
INDUSTRIES.

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.538
AND IF OVER TIME THEY IDENTIFY A

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:55.940
COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT PAY

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:58.342
DATA -- DISPARITIES OVER TIME

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:59.577
THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO THAT DO AN

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:01.078
INVESTIGATION AND SEE WHETHER

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.513
WARRANTED IF THEY ARE THEN

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.681
THAT'S GREAT THE COMPANIES ON

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.216
VIOLATION OF ANY LAWS.

00:38:05.282 --> 00:38:06.484
AND IF THEY'RE NOT THEN THEY CAN

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.718
THEN ENFORCE THE LAWS AS THEY

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.353
ARE REQUIRED TO DO.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.221
SO WE THINK THIS PAID REPORTING

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:11.722
IS AN EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE TOOL

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.424
THAT WILL HELP INCREASE --

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:14.992
EFFORTS TO HELP COMBAT THE PAY

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:16.861
DISPARITIES THAT WE KNOW EXIST

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:22.400
AND FOR THAT REASON WE ARE DRY

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:22.733
BOTH AND YOU.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.169
THINK YOU.

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:25.703
GOOD AFTERNOON SHOWS WITH

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:26.237
CROWLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:26.737
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.239
UNIVERSITY WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:28.305 --> 00:38:29.774
OF A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL --

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.709
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OVER THE LAST

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.145
BIT ABOUT -- FEAR PACE ALL KEEP

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.179
THROUGH THESE COMMENTS BRIEF BUT

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.547
I THINK THAT SOME HIGHLIGHTS ARE

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:38.783
WE'D SAID UP UNTIL RECENTLY THAT

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:42.219
WAS GOING TAKE ABOUT FIFTY YEARS

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.287
TO CLOSE THE GENDER PAY GAP.

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.089
BASED ON DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:46.824
TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN IT'S

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:50.027
A HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS NOW.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.162
SO NOW ALL THE LAWS THAT WE'VE

00:38:51.228 --> 00:38:52.997
DONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:54.198
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.000
FULLY TAKEN EFFECT BUT IT GIVES

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:57.501
YOU A GOOD IDEA ABOUT.

00:38:57.568 --> 00:38:59.103
NO MATTER ALL THE GREAT LAWS WE

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.205
HAVE ON THE BOOKS WE NEED TO DO

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.207
MORE IN ENFORCEMENT.

00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:05.710
OUR DATA SHOW THE ONLY ABOUT

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:08.079
6212% OF PAY DISPARITY IS

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:09.647
STUDENT OUT RIGHT BY.

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:10.514
OR DISCRIMINATION [inaudible]

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:13.150
THE MAJORITY OF THIS IS

00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:14.652
PERPETUATION OF THE STATUS QUO

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:18.389
INCLUDING A JOB SEGREGATION.

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:21.058
WOMEN IN ADDITION TO MAKING ON

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.893
AVERAGE ABOUT 80% OR EIGHTY

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.161
CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF OF

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:25.896
MEN FOR WOMEN OF COLOR IT

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:28.165
SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE LEGAL TEAM

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.633
THIS IS LESS THAN FIFTY CENTS.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.402
ON THE ON THE DOLLAR I'M THEY

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:33.671
USUALLY GENERALLY NEED EXTRA

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:34.972
DEGREES.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.007
IF THEY GO TO COLLEGE TO MAKE A

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.509
SIMILAR SALARIES SO THEN THEY

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:40.177
ALSO THIS GETS INTO THE STUDENT

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.346
LOAN DEBT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.315
GET OUT OF AND ALSO THINK OF

00:39:44.381 --> 00:39:47.651
THIS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:47.885
WORKING.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:48.819
WOMEN.

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.354
THAT ARE USING SOCIAL SAFETY NET

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:53.257
PROGRAMS THAT WOULDN'T HAVE TO

00:39:53.324 --> 00:39:55.126
IF THEY WERE BEING PAID FAIRLY.

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:56.427
AND WERE IN.

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.229
SOME BETTER JOBS.

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:03.033
I'M JUST A NOTE ON THE THE THE

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.136
APPEAL FROM THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.680
A DISCRIMINATION -- THE CHAMBERS

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:30.481
WERE CLOSELY WITH SENATOR

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.360
HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:44.929
WITH THIS BILL WE'VE TESTIFIED

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:47.631
ABOUT SIMILAR BILLS IN THE LAST.

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:48.732
FEW YEARS OLD I'LL KEEP OUR

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:50.301
COMMENTS BRIEF OUR OVERALL

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.403
CONCERN IS THAT -- THE REPORTING

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:53.737
REQUIREMENT IN THIS BILL CREATES

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.940
PERHAPS A FALSE IMPRESSION OF

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:57.508
WHICH DISCRIMINATION WHEN NINE

00:42:57.574 --> 00:42:59.543
MAY IN FACT EXIST -- IT RELIES

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.779
ON JOB TITLES AND JOB

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:02.780
CLASSIFICATIONS.

00:43:02.846 --> 00:43:04.281
NOT ALWAYS DISPARITIES UNLAWFUL

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:05.549
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE NON

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:06.984
DISCRIMINATORY REASONS FOR PAY

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.052
DISPARITIES.

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:10.054
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH THE

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.021
SAME JOB TITLES.

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:13.324
EDUCATION EXPERIENCE LEVELS YOU

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.858
CAN HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO'S GOT

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:17.027
THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE.

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:17.628
WITH THE SAME JOB TITLES IN A

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:18.929
PLEA HAS SIX MONTHS OF

00:43:18.996 --> 00:43:20.197
EXPERIENCE THEY OBVIOUSLY MAY

00:43:20.264 --> 00:43:21.899
HAVE DIFFERENT PAY -- BUT IT'S

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.267
NOT NECESSARILY A VIOLATION OF

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.301
THE LAW BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:25.936
LEGITIMATE EXPLANATION FOR THE

00:43:26.003 --> 00:43:27.671
DIFFERENCE -- AND WE DON'T THINK

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:28.605
THESE FACTORS WILL BE

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:29.840
SUFFICIENTLY CAPTURED IN THIS

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.642
PAID OUT AND WE'RE CONCERNED

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:32.376
THAT IT CREATES THE FALSE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:33.644
IMPRESSION BUT THERE'S A

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.179
VIOLATION OF THE LAW AND IF THIS

00:43:35.245 --> 00:43:36.313
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.115
TAKES ACTION ON THAT YES THE

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:41.218
EMPLOYER CAN.

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.455
BUT THAT IS THE TIME AND EXPENSE --

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:45.089
WHEN THERE'S NO VIOLATION OF THE

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.757
LAW?

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:47.358
BUT WE ALSO THINK -- YOU KNOW

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:48.625
WE'RE GETTING TO THE TAIL END OF

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:51.061
THE THE BACK AND FORTH OVER THE

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:52.262
FEDERAL EO ONE THERE WAS.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.331
LITIGATION CHALLENGING THE TRUMP

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:55.632
ADMINISTRATION SCALING BACK TO

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:57.601
THE E. A ONE WORK REQUIREMENT.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:43:58.902
IN MARCH THE THE COURT

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.471
OVERTURNED THAT THE FEDERAL

00:44:00.537 --> 00:44:01.839
GOVERNMENT HAS APPEALED.

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:04.008
THAT DECISION -- BUT THE EEOC IS

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.509
WEBSITE STATES THAT THE NOTICE

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.077
OF APPEAL DOES NOT POTS THE

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.079
COURT'S ORDER IN ANY WAY OR IN

00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:11.115
ANY WAY ALTER THE EO ONE FILERS

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:11.615
OBLIGATIONS TO SUBMIT.

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:13.784
DATA TO BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.519
THEY'RE ON TRACK TO BE UP

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.154
AGAINST COLLECTING PAID OUT OF

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:22.693
FOUR CALENDAR YEARS 220-172-2018.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.994
SO WE HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:24.862
IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.397
SEAMLESS WHAT WITH THE IMPENDING

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:27.464
EO ONE REQUIREMENT AND THESE

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.766
WERE RAISED IN THE SENATE LABOR

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:30.134
COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AS WELL.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.235
WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.903
CONSISTENCY AND SO WHILE THE

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.405
BILL PURPORTS TO PROVIDE AN

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:36.040
EMPLOYER CAN SIT SIMPLY SUBMIT

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:37.474
THAT FEDERAL EO ONE SATISFIES

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.342
REQUIREMENTS.

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.910
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

00:44:39.977 --> 00:44:41.678
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AT THAT SAYS

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:42.212
IT HAS TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.147
SIMILAR.

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.882
INFORMATION -- MAY BE

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:46.483
INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT THE EO

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.119
ONE THE FEDERAL YEAR ONE IS NOT

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:49.720
ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:50.387
SOMETHING MORE.

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:52.056
WE'VE ALSO ASKED WE APPRECIATE

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:53.357
THE THE AUTHORS WORK TO ENSURE

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:55.025
THAT THERE'S NOT A PUBLIC

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:58.962
RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND THIS

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.531
INFORMATION IS PROTECTED.

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:01.165
THE FEDERAL EO ONE REQUIREMENT

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.533
HAS SOME ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:03.767
AGAINST EMPLOYEES.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.802
FROM THE AGENCY WHO LEAKED THIS

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:07.171
INFORMATION IN THE SENATE

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:09.573
COMMITTEE REYES THESE.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.275
TWO AMENDMENTS.

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.943
AS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THEY

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.977
WERE NOT TAKEN IN THE SENATE WE

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:14.845
THINK AGAIN IF THIS IS GONNA BE

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.147
CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL EO.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:18.382
ONE THOSE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.149
WOULD HELP MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.984
THIS IS IN FACT CONSISTENT WITH

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:24.121
THAT REQUIREMENT AND SO FOR

00:45:24.188 --> 00:45:26.890
THESE THOSE REASONS WERE POSTED.

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:29.093
THANK YOU JUST TO JUST TO ADD

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:30.327
VERY BRIEFLY -- MISTER CHAIR.

00:45:30.394 --> 00:45:31.428
FIRST ITEM IS THAT THE CENTER

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:32.696
JACKSON INDICATED THAT --

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.264
EMPLOYERS CARTE CANNOT COMBAT

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.699
WHAT THEY CAN'T SEE.

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.167
OBVIOUSLY IN ORDER TO COMPLY

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:39.236
WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:40.537
THE EO ONE FORM.

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:42.406
BUSINESSES HAVE TO COMPILE THAT

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.408
DATA TO COMPLETE THE FORM SO

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:45.843
SUBMITTING THE SAME FORM.

DONE AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN REYES

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.549
AND I THINK IS MISS STANDER

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:53.750
INDICATED.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.285

WITH SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.558
EIGHT IN THE FALL OF TWENTY

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:02.426
FIFTEEN AFTER THE GOVERNOR

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:03.694
SIGNED THAT BILL.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.596
IN FACT IF YOU SAW MANY STORIES

00:46:05.662 --> 00:46:06.830
IN THE MERCURY NEWS IN THE

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.665
CHRONICLE IN THE LA TIMES ABOUT

BUSINESSES PUBLICLY TRADED ONES

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:11.969
THAT WERE MAKING ANNOUNCEMENTS

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:12.803
HOW.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.738
IF THEY COULDN'T JUSTIFY ANY PAY

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:16.540
DISPARITIES THEY WERE IN FACT --

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:17.908
RAISING THOSE SALARIES WHICH IS

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:19.376
OF COURSE IS A REQUIREMENT OF

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.811
THE LAW RATHER THAN LOWERING.

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.346
SO THE GOOD ACTORS HAVE BEEN IN

GOOD JOB OF EXPLAINING THE BILL

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:27.383

IMMENSE AMOUNT OF COMPROMISE

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:28.651
THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:29.152
TO MAKE IT WORKABLE FOR

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:31.688
EMPLOYERS -- IN IN TO A POINT

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:33.323
WHERE -- UNLESS WE'RE STILL

LEAVING A LOT OF WOMEN AND

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:34.958
PROTECTED BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:36.126
TO MAKE INCREMENTAL CHANGE --

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.260
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.862
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE TIME

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:41.631
PERIOD WE ALLOW OR EVEN COURAGE

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:43.399
WOMEN TO TAKE OFF WORK -- AFTER

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:45.235
HAVING A BABY DOESNOT MATCH UP

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:46.936
WITH THE TIME PERIOD THAT ANY

WITH BREAST MILK IF POSSIBLE AND

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.011
SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.514
DOING ON THE HEALTHIEST AT AND

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.882
AND MOST BENEFICIAL THING FOR

00:56:58.948 --> 00:56:59.516
CHILDREN.

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:01.251
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A SITUATION

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:02.819
BY WHICH A WOMAN CAN RETURN TO

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:04.921
WORK ON HER TIMELINE AND STILL

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:08.858
PROVIDE BREASTMILK -- I HAPPEN

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:09.759
TO HAVE.

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:10.660
HAD SOME OF THOSE EXPERIENCES

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.028
RETURNING TO SCHOOL AND THEN

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.763
LATER TO WORK ON ON DIFFERENT

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:15.832
CHILDREN -- WHILE I WAS STILL

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.433
BREAST FEEDING AND I'M HAVING.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.702
BREAST FED IN BATHROOMS --

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.105
CLOSETS AT AT MY DESK WHERE

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.540
ANYONE CAN WALK AND I WILL TELL

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.742
YOU THAT I IT IS YOU KNOW IT

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:28.511
TAKES A LOT IN THIS IS PROBABLY.

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:30.814
NOT FAIR TO SAY THE LEAST TO TO

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.216
ASK WOMEN -- TO DO THAT IN I

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.984
LITERALLY BROUGHT MY BABY AND

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.420
DEPRESSED FEET I WASN'T PUMPING --

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:39.222
PUMPING AS OF A FIRE -- MORE

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.758
INTENSE SITUATION A MOST MOST

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.459
WORKERS MUST WOMEN CAN'T JUST

00:57:43.526 --> 00:57:44.661
BRING THEIR CHILD INTO BREAST

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:46.362
FEED OUT WORK AND SO -- PUMPING

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.898
IS THE ONLY POSSIBILITY -- THAT

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.867
SHE HOUSE AND SO TO DO THAT YOU

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:53.837
NEED PRIVACY YOU NEED AN OUTLET

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:54.737
YOU NEED.

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:57.540
A DESK OR A TABLE AND A CHAIR --

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:59.409
AND THOSE IN SOME PRIVACY AND

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:01.244
AND THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:01.945
FOR OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT THAT

00:58:02.011 --> 00:58:03.012
BREAST MILK TO GO BAD SO

00:58:03.079 --> 00:58:04.480
REFRIGERATION AS WELL.

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.082
SO I THINK THIS IS COMMON SENSE

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.951
I THINK IT'S VERY LIMITED NOW IN

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:10.520
ITS APPLICATION AND IS ONE STEP

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:11.588

BREASTFEEDING IMPRESS READING IS

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.672

THE STARTING POINT WHICH WE

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.295
THINK IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME --

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:00.263

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.246
REQUIREMENTS SO WE'VE ASKED FOR

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.814
THE BUILDING CODE PROVISIONS TO

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:19.982
BE DELETED FROM THIS BILL.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:21.417

OVERLAPPING PROVISIONS OF THE

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.782
CONFUSION -- AN INCONSISTENT

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:54.684

INCREASED LITIGATION COSTS

01:05:58.587 --> 01:05:59.655
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THESE

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.157
PRESCRIPTIVE AND DETAILED

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.158

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:19.342
POPULAR VACATION.

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:21.043
SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:21.644
THERE'S GOING TO BE INCREASED

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:22.578
LITIGATION HERE.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.179
AND THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:23.779
RAISE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:24.280
PROVISION THAT ADDS THE

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:25.881
LACTATION BREAKS TO LABOR CODE

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.316
SECTION TWO TO SIX POINT.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.718
SEVEN WHICH IS THE REMEDY OF ONE

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:30.286
HOUR PAY FOR NOT PROVIDING MEAL

01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:32.455
AND REST PERIODS TWO EMPLOYEES

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.290
AND SO MEAL RECIPES ARE --

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.925
EASIER FOR AN EMPLOYEE TO

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:37.293
IMPLEMENT AND POLICE SAID

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.295
MONITOR BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED ON

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:40.429
VERY FINITE REQUIREMENTS IN THE

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.164
LAW THE MEAL PERIOD HAS TO BE

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:43.466
PROVIDED BEFORE THE END OF THE

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:44.533
FIFTH HOUR OF WORK.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.868
REST PERIODS HAVE TO BE PROVIDED

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:49.905
EVERY FOUR HOURS IN THE MIDDLE

01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:51.207
OF THOSE FOR OUR CHEFS.

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.208
LACTATION THE COMBINATION BREAKS

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:54.477
BY NATURE ARE MORE SUBJECTIVE

01:06:54.543 --> 01:06:55.311
EVERY EMPLOYEE IS GONNA BE

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:56.545
DIFFERENT EVERYBODY EMPLOYEES

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.080
CAN HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS MORE

01:06:58.147 --> 01:06:59.181
FREQUENCY OF BREAKS.

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:00.449
SO FOR THAT REASON THAT IT'S

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.684
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE EMPLOYER

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.219
TO MONITOR AND POLICE THAT THE

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:05.121
EMPLOYEE IS TAKING THOSE BREAKS

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.689
AT THE GIVEN TIME THAT THEY NEED.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:08.324
AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED THAT

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.025
IMPOSING THE HARSH PENALTY OF

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.427
LABOR CO TWO TO SIX POINT SEVEN

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:12.928
DOESN'T MESH WITH.

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.797
THAT SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THESE

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.099
TYPE OF BREAKS AND SO WE'VE

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.068
ASKED THAT THE PROVISIONS ADDING.

01:07:19.135 --> 01:07:20.136
LACTATION BREAKS THE LABOR CODE

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.404
SECTION TWO TO SIX POINT SEVEN

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.938
BE DELETED FROM THE BILL -- SO

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.273
WE'VE SUBMITTED PROPOSED

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.975
AMENDMENTS TO AUTHORS OFFICE ON

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.276
SEVERAL OCCASIONS WILL CONTINUE

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.978
TO WORK WITH THE STAFF BUT FOR

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:32.348
THESE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.683
THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:35.317
THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:35.885
MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY

01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:37.219
ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE ALSO POSE

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:37.787
FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.288
OUTLINED TO BY THE CHAMBER BUT

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:41.524
ALSO FOR A PARTICULAR REASON

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.225
RELATED TO MANUFACTURING.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:47.696
SO WE UNDERSTAND -- EAT THE NEED

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:48.731
TO TRY.

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:51.066
TO CONFORME THIS BILL -- TO THE

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:53.469
FEDERAL LAW RELATED TO THE UNDUE

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:55.604
HARDSHIP AND WHILE WE DIDN'T

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:56.772
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT

01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:58.073
DISCUSSION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.442
RELATED TO THAT PROVISION.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:00.810
WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:02.611
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT RELATED TO

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.213
MANUFACTURING IT'S NOT REALLY

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.781
BASS THE HARDSHIP IS NOT REALLY

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.850
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.552
BUT REALLY ON THE CHARACTERISTIC

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.821
OF THE INDUSTRIAL FACILITY.

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:13.722
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.057
FIVE EMPLOYEES IN THAT FACILITY

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.226
OR YOU HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES

01:08:17.293 --> 01:08:19.662
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PLACE OTHER

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.764
THAN THE BATHROOM THAT IS CLOSED

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.899
OFF FOR PRIVACY. FOR SAFETY FOR

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.100
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.770
EXPOSED TO THE OUTPUT OF THE

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.105
MANUFACTURING PRACTICE THEN YOU

01:08:30.172 --> 01:08:31.607
CANNOT PROVIDE.

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:33.976
ACCORDING TO THE THE PROVISIONS

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.578
IN THE BILL AND YOU WOULD NEED

01:08:35.644 --> 01:08:36.812
TO PROVIDE THAT SPACE THAT

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:38.747
PROVIDES THAT PRIVACY AND

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:41.817
SECURITY AND AND ELIMINATION FOR

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:43.052
EXPOSE OR TWO THAT THOSE BY

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:43.919
PRODUCTS.

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:46.088
EVEN A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE MAY

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.623
NOT WORK IF YOU EVER SEEN THESE

01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.991
INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THEY COULD

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.693
BE FILLED THE WHOLE FACILITY

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.261
COULD BE FILLED WITH INDUSTRIAL

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.963
EQUIPMENT AND THERE JUST ISN'T A

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.598
PLACE TO PUT A TEMPORARY.

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:58.000
STRUCTURE SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE

01:08:58.067 --> 01:08:59.535
HAPPY TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLY

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:01.270
MEMBER Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; LAST YEAR AND&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.771
WORK ON A HARDSHIP EXEMPTION

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.807
THAT TOOK INTO THE CONSIDERATION.

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:06.775
THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:09.011
FACILITY IN ADDITION TO THAT TO

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:10.346
ADDRESS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.348
CONCERNED THAT ALL EMPLOYERS

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:14.316
COULD NOW SELL CERTIFY IF YOU

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:15.784
WILL THAT THEY HAD A HARDSHIP

01:09:15.851 --> 01:09:17.019
AND THEREFORE COULD.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.888
COME UNDER THIS EXEMPTION SHE

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:21.090
PUT LANGUAGE IN THERE SO THAT WE

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.892
WOULD HAVE TO BASICALLY

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.827
CERTIFIED TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.629
THE HARDSHIP EXISTED SO WAS A

01:09:26.695 --> 01:09:27.796
LITTLE YOU KNOW SOMETHING ON THE

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.665
BACK IN TO MAKE SURE.

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:30.232
THAT EMPLOYERS JUST WEREN'T

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.101
CLAIMING OUT WHEN IT WASN'T

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.104
POSSIBLE WE THINK THAT PROVIDES --

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.573
ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS OF THAT

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.974
ARTHUR BUT ALSO PARTICULARLY THE

01:09:39.041 --> 01:09:40.209
CONCERNS OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:41.610
RELATED TO THAT HARDSHIP

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.078
EXEMPTION SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:44.613
ASKING IS FOR THE HARDSHIP

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.948
EXEMPTION TO MIRROR WHAT'S IN

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.184
CALIFORNIA.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.653
BECAUSE IF THIS BILL DID BE COME

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.387
LAW IT WOULD PROVIDE MORE

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:52.187
PROTECTIONS TO EMPLOYEES AND BY

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.956
DOING THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.190
WOULD GOVERN.

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.293
AND SO NOW WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:58.327
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT A

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.728
CALIFORNIA LAW RELATED TO THAT

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.130
HARDSHIP EXEMPTION WOULD BE

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.398
ROLLED BACK AND FROM THE

01:10:02.464 --> 01:10:03.766

IMPACTED BY CHRONIC POVERTY.

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.195
IT SETS THE HIGHEST

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.530
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS FOR

NET EMISSIONS AND ZERO NET GHG.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:44.446
IT PROTECTS COMMUNITY

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:46.548

IT REQUIRES SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:03.365

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:08.670
TRADES.

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:11.206
WHICH IS A SKILL SET THAT THE

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.107
STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS.

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.675
REQUIRES PREVAILING WAGES FOR

PROJECTS ABOVE TWENTY FIVE UNITS

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:17.112

THAT SET FOR TO FOURTH TODAY.

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:24.986
SO IT IS NOT A SEQUEL EXCEPTION

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.655
AND I REPEAT THAT IT'S NOT AN

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:27.789
EXEMPTION.

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:29.457

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:40.535
LITIGATION.

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.270
IT DOES THIS BY SIMPLY REQUIRING

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.639
THE COURTS TO SEEK TO REACH A

01:20:48.043 --> 01:20:51.012
IF FEASIBLE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:52.914
THE OFFRAMP -- IT WILL

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.449
DISCOURAGE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.152
pTHEY ARE CHALLENGING PROJECTS

STANDARD AND THAT THE SUITS WILL

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:03.758
BE RISK RESOLVED IN A TIMELY

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:04.159
MANNER.

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:05.227
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHICH

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.294
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN THE

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.330
INVESTMENT IN IN -- IN THESE

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:10.198
PROJECTS -- IT CREATES A

MULTIPLIER EFFECT WITH THE

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:31.086
SO IT AMPLIFIES THE

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:33.121
ADMINISTRATION'S INTEREST IN

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:34.556
OPPORTUNITY SOUNDS.

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:41.062
SO -- I'LL THAT THIS BILL IS

01:21:41.129 --> 01:21:42.197

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:21.396
IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:22.597
PERHAPS THERE IS LACK OF

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.898
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.133
AS THE STATE LOOKS TO INVEST IN

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.601
HOUSING -- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.803
A CRISIS OUT THERE WE KNOW THAT

HERE WITH THIS LEGISLATION ON

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:40.648

80% EIGHTY AND MY AND BELOW IS

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.190
VERY IMPORTANT IS VERY

01:23:49.257 --> 01:23:51.626
SIGNIFICANT THAT IS VERY -- LOW

THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE HOUSING

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.739
THAT -- ACTUALLY WILL DIVERSIFY

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.775

HIGHER IN COMMAND OF LEVELS I

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.317

BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:22.557
HAPPENING THERE -- THE IMPORTANT

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.125
LABOR PROTECTIONS ARE ENSURE

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.493
THAT THE INVESTMENT THAT IS

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.662
BEING MADE AND AS A PARTNERSHIP

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.263
WITH THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

WORKERS THAT ARE BUILDING THE

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.033
ASSETS BEHIND.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.401
RIGHT WE KNOW THAT CONSTRUCTION

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:35.170
WORKERS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:37.205
LOW WAGES IN A NON UNIONIZED

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:37.872
ENVIRONMENT.

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.374
WHAT WE WANT TO JUST TRY TO DO

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.910
HERE IS INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF

01:24:41.976 --> 01:24:43.311
THE PREVAILING WAGE TO LIFT UP

CONTRACTOR ON THE JOB?

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:49.617
THAT THOSE NONUNION CONTRACTORS

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.252
SO THAT THAT THAT DOES NOT.

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:54.255

QUESTION WHERE I WAS ON THIS

BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:37.785
BEEN AGAINST THE BUILDING TRADES

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:39.687
AND WITH THE ABC -- SO I

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:40.254
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BECAUSE

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:40.922
ABSOLUTELY ON THAT ONE PROVISION

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:41.756
I WANT TO BE CLEAR EIGHT THAT IS

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:42.556
THE ONLY THING I'M SUPPORTIVE OF

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:44.959
IN THIS BILL -- AND SO I THINK.

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:46.394
THE AUTHOR.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.895
FOR TAKING THAT ON I CAN'T AT

01:32:47.962 --> 01:32:49.430
THIS POINT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

01:32:49.497 --> 01:32:51.399
I'M SORRY -- I CAN'T I COULD

01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:52.667
SUPPORT IT IF WE WERE ONLY

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:53.801
TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSING

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.202
DEVELOPMENT SO HOUSING

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.637
DEVELOPMENTS WITH OVER TWENTY

01:32:56.704 --> 01:32:58.105
FIVE UNITS I COULD -- I COULD

01:32:58.172 --> 01:33:00.041
GET BEHIND AN EXPEDITED REVIEW.

01:33:00.107 --> 01:33:02.910
FOR BUT I THINK AS AS DESCRIBED --

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.578
THIS IS FAR BIGGER THAN THAT MY

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.714
PROBLEM ALWAYS WITH -- EXPEDITED

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:08.149
REVIEW AND SEE WHAT IS QUITE

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:10.184
FRANKLY -- THE FACT THAT WE LACK

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.920
ANY WAY OF OF FROM AN

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:14.155
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN A IN A

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.656
ECONOMIC JUSTICE STANDPOINT.

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:18.159
OF INVOLVING OURSELVES IN THE

01:33:18.225 --> 01:33:19.293
PROCESS WITHOUT SEEK.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.161
ONE SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.629
INAPPROPRIATE I DON'T I I THINK

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.798
THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE HAVE

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:25.700
TO DO IN ORDER TO HAVE A VOICE

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:26.734
IS HEARD ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:27.969
THAT.

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:30.771
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT -- LOW

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.006
INCOME AREAS THAT SOMETIMES.

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.374
ALL DEVELOPMENT IS NOT GOOD YOU

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:36.077
KNOW AND ALL JOBS ARE NOT GOOD --

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.645
AND SO BRINGING THINGS INTO A

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:39.814
COMMUNITY JUST BASED ON THE IDEA

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.182
THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN A

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:42.316
COMMUNITY.

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.151
SOMETIMES SOUNDS GOOD -- AT THE

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:46.053
MACRO LEVEL BUT IN PLACE IS NOT

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.788
GOOD SO I WANT TO PRESERVE THOSE

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:51.125
TOOLS -- FOR THOSE IN A LOCAL

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:57.965
AREA I I LIVE IN A DISTRICT THAT.

01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.501
I THINK THIS ENTIRE AREA COVERS --

01:34:00.568 --> 01:34:02.470
AT ALMOST EVERY CENSUS TRACT IS

01:34:02.536 --> 01:34:03.604
IS ACTUALLY ENACTED IN IN.

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.506
AN IMPOVERISHED AREA SO -- I I

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:07.341
AT THIS POINT CAN'T SUPPORTED I

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.542
ABSOLUTELY ON BE CLEAR ON THE

01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:10.378
RECORD WOULD SUPPORT A EXPEDITED

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.046
REVIEW SEQUENCE EMPTION -- FOR

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:15.349
HOUSING PROJECT THAT HAD

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:16.550
PREVAILING WAGE.

01:34:16.617 --> 01:34:18.552
COMPONENTS TO IT BUT FOR NOW I

01:34:18.619 --> 01:34:21.956
CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL.

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:24.358
SENATE JONES SAWYER -- SO I

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:26.427
THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.129
CLARIFICATION -- THAT I PROBABLY

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:29.230
NEED IN.

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:30.698
AND SOME OTHER THINGS LOOK OUT

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:31.332
NOT TO BE TOTALLY HYPOCRITICAL

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:32.166
AYE I WAS LOOKING WHEN I FIRST

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.467
GOT HERE.

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:35.169
I WANTED TO DO.

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:37.805
A A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE

01:34:37.872 --> 01:34:39.940
SEQUEL CERTAINTY.

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:41.876
I'M AN INDIVIDUAL I WAS DIRECTOR

01:34:41.942 --> 01:34:43.677
WILL STAY FOR THE CITY OF LA.

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:46.047
I'M ONE MOST EXASPERATING THINGS.

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:48.082
THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.251
USED TO DO TO ME WHEN I TRY TO

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:53.120
BUILD A FIRE STATION LIBRARY FOR

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:55.089
A POLICE STATION.

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:57.958
THEY WILL COME OUT AND OPPOSED.

01:34:58.025 --> 01:34:59.593
DOES THE GODS BUILDINGS AND TO

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.063
OPPOSE OF LIBRARY JUST DIDN'T

01:35:02.129 --> 01:35:03.497
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WHATSOEVER.

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.733
BUT THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO QUIT

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:06.867
SEQUEL TO BE ABLE TO SUE THE

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:10.404
CITY DELAY THE PROJECT.

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:11.972
DELAY LIBRARY.

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.140
OR DELAY SCHOOL.

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:16.610
IT JUST IT JUST DROVE ME CRAZY.

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:19.747
AND AND SO I I NEVER WANTED US.

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.082
TO NOT GO THROUGH THE WHOLE

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:22.383
CYCLE PROCESS.

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:24.718
BUT THE TAKE TEN YEARS TO BUILD

01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:25.753
SOMETHING.

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.621
BECAUSE SOMEONE SUES AND ENSUED

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:29.723
THEY LOSE THAT SUIT AND A SU

01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:30.791
AGAIN AND SEWER AGAIN.

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:32.560
WHICH TO DRIVE ME NUTS AND RISEN

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.828
DRAMATICALLY I WAS THE ONE THAT

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.930
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROJECT

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:38.165
AND AND NOT GETTING DONE.

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:40.334
IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN.

01:35:40.401 --> 01:35:40.734
IT'S YOUR MONEY.

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:41.902
AND YOUR ON THE HOOK AS OPPOSED

01:35:41.969 --> 01:35:43.104
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:46.140
AND SO I KNOW YOU HAVE EXPEDITED

01:35:46.207 --> 01:35:47.741
I KNOW WITH MY FRIENDS AND

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.577
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IS BASED

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:51.679
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY --

01:35:51.745 --> 01:35:53.180
WHEN I SAY SEEK WITH CERTAINTY

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:54.281
WHICH MEANS YOU GO THROUGH ALL

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.517
THE TRAPS WITHIN GOVERNMENT

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.752
PLANNING BUILDING SAFETY?

01:35:58.819 --> 01:36:00.754
PUBLIC WORKS FIRE DEPARTMENT.

01:36:00.821 --> 01:36:01.722
THAT ONCE YOU FINISH THAT

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:03.791
PROCESS YOU CAN THEN BILLS --

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.392
FOR THEM FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:09.563
THAT'S EXPEDITE. TO ME THAT'S

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.198
THE CERTAINTY OF HAJJI CHARETTE

01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:12.867
YOU HAD TO PULL DISCUSSION WITH

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:14.135
THE COMMUNITY AND YOU'RE DONE.

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:15.803
WE DON'T RE HASH IT ALL OVER

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:19.607
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND SO --

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:20.841
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT GOING

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:21.909
FOR IT NOW.

01:36:21.976 --> 01:36:24.879
I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.514
ON WHAT.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.483
EXPEDITED MEANS BOTH FROM YOUR

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:35.356
SIDE AND THE OTHER SIDE. TO IS A

01:36:35.422 --> 01:36:37.224
LABOR PERSON I GUESS SOME

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:39.193
DISTRESSING THINGS I WAS HEARING

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.895
SO I WOULD LIKE THAT CLARIFIED

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:43.931
FOR ME ALSO -- BECAUSE I USED TO

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.900
HELP GET THOSE SHEETS IN THE

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:47.168
CITY OF LA TO PUT MAKE SURE THAT

01:36:47.234 --> 01:36:48.836
WE WERE.

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:50.304
WE'RE PAYING THE APPROPRIATE

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:52.039
WAGES AND AND WE HAD A WHOLE

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.607
DEPARTMENT THAT WASN'T.

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:54.808
YOU KNOW BILL CONTRACT

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.644
ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS THEIR

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:59.380
SOLE JOB AS YOU KNOW -- TO TO

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:02.116
ENSURE THAT MIGHT WE PAID NOT

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.317
ONLY PEOPLE FROM THE COMMUNITY

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:03.951
BUT WE PAY THEM THE APPROPRIATE

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:04.685
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND THEY

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:07.454
ACTUALLY GOT PAID BY THE PRIME

01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:07.855
TO SELL.

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:09.523
SO -- PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.058
THIS THAN I EVER WANTED TO IN MY

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:14.828
ENTIRE LIFE -- AND SO I I WANT

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.430
TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I

01:37:16.497 --> 01:37:17.031
THINK IT WILL ALSO BE GOOD.

01:37:17.097 --> 01:37:18.566
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN AGAINST

01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:20.367
LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY AND

01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:21.268
HAVING THEM.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.938
A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT VIRAL

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.673
JUSTICE CLAIMS SO THE REASON I

01:37:25.739 --> 01:37:27.341
WANTED TO DO THIS IN A BROADER.

01:37:27.408 --> 01:37:28.542
I WANTED IF YOU LIVE IN A

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:31.045
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY I WANT

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:33.280
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:34.915
SEEK WITH CERTAINTY.

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.684
BECAUSE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:38.219
REASON IN SOUTH LA WHICH I

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.587
REPRESENTING PEOPLE WERE

01:37:39.653 --> 01:37:41.655
COMMENTING ON WHERE I LIVE SO I

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:44.458
FELT I SHOULD COMMENT.

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:46.594
TO I DON'T HAVE A MALL.

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.062

I DON'T HAVE SIT DOWN

RESTAURANTS.

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.199
BUT I DO KNOW.

I ALSO DON'T HAVE ANY BIG BOX.

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.771
THE MY DISTRICT.

01:37:57.838 --> 01:38:00.741
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WALMART

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:02.710
BUTTON TOM HAVE ANY BIG BOX.

01:38:02.776 --> 01:38:05.613

QUEST.

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:55.723

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:10.237
BECAUSE I FIGURED THAT'S THE

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:11.038
BEST WAY TO DO IT THAT'S IT

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:13.240
LET'S LET STREAMLINED THE SEQUEL

01:40:13.307 --> 01:40:14.975

AND AND I AND I TOOK A LOT OF

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:21.315
HEAT FOR THAT SO I I I THE

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.182
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO USE

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.151
PRIVATE DOLLARS.

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:25.986
IN OUR POOREST COMMUNITIES.

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:28.355
IS SEVEN YEARS WHERE I YEARS

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:30.858
PAST NOW -- IF IT TAKES TEN

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:32.526
YEARS TO BUILD THAT SIT DOWN

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:33.927
RESTAURANT GUESS WHAT.

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.396
THERE IS NOT GONNA BE ANY

01:40:35.462 --> 01:40:37.131
INVESTMENT IN OUR POOREST

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.632
COMMUNITIES AND WHAT HIS

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:40.401
CALIFORNIA DEN. FOR OUR

01:40:40.467 --> 01:40:42.803
DESIGNATED ZONES WHICH IS

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.105
ABSOLUTELY ZERO WE HAVEN'T WE

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:46.306
HAVEN'T SAID WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.741
CREATE THIS OPPORTUNITY WE'RE

01:40:47.808 --> 01:40:48.842
GONNA PUT MONEY WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:48.909 --> 01:40:50.411
FOCUS ON ON BUILDING IN THESE

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:51.512
COMMUNITIES.

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:54.348
AND SO ON SO CITIES ARE LEFT.

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.316
TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:57.951
SOME OF WE DID WE USED TO DO IT

01:40:58.018 --> 01:40:59.386
THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.320
THOSE ARE GONE.

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:02.556
AND AND THIS IS PRIVATE DOLLARS

01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:06.260
AND SO SO -- SO NOT ONLY DO WE

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:07.895

EMISSIONS CREATED AND AND AND

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:20.441
I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE I

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.875
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE BUILDING TO

01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.544
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN THESE

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:26.013
COMMUNITIES -- AND AND I'M HAPPY

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:28.849
TO ADD THAT THE PROTECTION --

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.684
FOR LABOR AS WELL AND AND WE'LL

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.052

TIME AND WE'VE HAD SOME MEETINGS.

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:49.169
THE KEY IS NOT TO MOVE THE GOAL

01:41:49.236 --> 01:41:51.538

WE'RE FOCUSING MORE ON THE LABOR

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.852
CONCERNS -- AND THERE'S BEEN A

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.688
LOT OF MOVEMENT THAT ALLOWS

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:48.755
ACTUALLY THE BILL REACHES A BEER

01:43:48.822 --> 01:43:49.723

AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE

01:44:05.606 --> 01:44:07.407
AS WE CAN IMAGINE BUT I THINK

ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT I

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.882

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:26.360
LABOR ASPECT OF THIS AND SO.

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:28.261

CONVERSATION -- ON THIS AND I

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:41.742
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION FOR

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:42.676

FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THIS

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.812
BECAUSE THIS STILL HAS A LONG
