EIGHTY EIGHT ONE SIX. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THE SENATORS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE HOMELESS. AS THIS COMMITTEE WELL KNOWS OUR STATE HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF UNSHELTERED HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE COUNTRY IT'S A TOP ISSUE FOR CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN SATISFIED WITH GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS WITH DATA DRIVEN STRATEGIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE THIS YEAR WHEN OUR BUDGET INCLUDES A HISTORIC. UNPRECEDENTED TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS. WHILE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ONGOING. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE LOCAL AND STATE STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS TO HOLD BOTH STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT REQUIRES THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLETE A CAPS AND NEEDS ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CREATE AN ACTIONABLE PLAN TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. BY NINETY PERCENT. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY NINE. THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL. THAT CAN HOLD THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAILING TO SUBMIT A PLAN OR FOR NOT FOLLOWING A PLAN. IN ADDITION TO HELP MEET THE STATEWIDE NEED FOR CREATING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING. HOMELESSNESS AND A CHRONIC SITUATION. THIS BILL WILL PRIORITIZE FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL HOUSING TRUST FUND. FOR PROJECTS SERVING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. CURRENTLY EIGHT CITY RECEIVES FUNDING FROM THE TRUST FUND. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO OUR WITNESS. OKAY- WE HAVE. ONE ONE TO THE WITNESSES I BELIEVE JULIE SNYDER AND SHARON REPORT IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY I'M GREAT SO- INSIDER'S REPORT YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES AND YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OR MAYBE IT'S STILL MORNING NOT SURE HOW HI THIS IS JULIE SNYDER WITH THE STANFORD INSTITUTE WE ARE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR A B. ONE SIX TO CREATE ENFORCEABLE MANDATES TO REDUCE HOW MUCH NOW. WE ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL YOUR BUDGET PRIORITIZED HELPLESSNESS CALIFORNIANS NUMBER ONE ISSUE ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM- THE LEADERSHIP OF YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR SENATOR SCANNER AND COPIER- IS MUCH APPRECIATED WHAT THAT INVESTMENT NEEDS NOW IS THE CONNECTING TISSUE THAT'LL ENSURE THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND LEVERAGE EACH OTHER'S STRENGTHS. TO ACHIEVE MEASURABLE OUTCOMES AB EIGHT ONE SIX IS THAT CONNECTING TISSUE FOR EXAMPLE THE BUDGET PROVIDES TWO BILLION TO LOCALITIES EIGHTY EIGHT ONE SIX WOULD REQUIRE THEY DEVELOP A REGIONAL GAPS A NEEDS ANALYSIS AS THE ROAD MAP TO SPEND THE SPOT ON THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND NOT ONLY THAT TWO BILLION BUT ALSO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION COUNTIES RECEIVING THE CALVERT HOUSING PROGRAM THE TWO BILLION AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FINDING ECCENTRIC CENTRAL COORDINATION OF THESE FUNDING STREAMS WILL MEET THE NEEDS OF MORE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WITH THIS FUNDING IS THE BUILD 90% FULL ACHIEVABLE WE CAN LOOK TO THE CITY OF BAKERSFIELD FOR ONE EXAMPLE AS OF JANUARY THIS YEAR THE ELIMINATED CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS THROUGH A SIX YEAR COLLABORATION WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS. HOW THEY DID IT THERE WAS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE FACT THAT THEY FIGURED IT OUT AND ABOUT TWENTY P. EIGHT ONE SIX CHARGES THE STATE AND EACH LOCALITY WITH DOING IN ANY WAY THEY FIND FEASIBLE IT WAS COMPLETELY. FLEXIBLE ON THE HOUSE. BEYOND IT RIGHT. JURISDICTION TEMPTED LEVELS OF RESEARCH. SO WHEN GROUP. EACH LOCALITIES PER. SCHOOL WILL BASED ON WHAT HE CAN RE. ACCOMPLISH TO REZONING USING EXISTING DOLLARS MORE EFFECTIVELY EXCEPT FOR US BUT WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT INACTION OR INEFFECTIVE APPROACHES HE B. EIGHT ONE SIX CREIGHTON INSPECTOR GENERAL AS WELL TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL. WE HOPE IT'S MERE EXISTENCE WILL CREATE THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE SHE EVERY OUNCE OF CREATIVITY MUST BE USED TO HELP THE GROWING NUMBER OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO LIVE OUTSIDE. WE URGE YOUR EYE ON THE. STATIONARY NOTHING MAJOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FROM SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN MEXICO AFTER ITSELF ADMITS NIGHTER INDICATED HOMELESSNESS IS SOLVABLE IN FACT FIVE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CITIES HAVE EITHER ELIMINATED- CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS OR VETERAN HOMELESSNESS IN MICHIGAN AND NEW JERSEY HAVE REDUCED HOMELESSNESS SIGNIFICANTLY BY SEVENTY AND 49% RESPECTIVELY. BUT WE NEED FUNDING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT EACH FINDING WAYS TO HANDLE SUCCESSFUL STATE THAT GOAL IS DATED TEN BEST COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE RESOURCES ANDIDENTIFYING REFORM FAILED POLICY. EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN HOLD ALL THE CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING WHAT WORK IT FIRST REQUIRES THE STATE TO DO GAPS AND NEEDS ANALYSIS. TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. WE HAVE A STATE HOME DATA INFORMATION SO. TO KNOW WHO THANKS FOR HOME AND REPEAT GO WHEN THEY ACT. WE NEXT NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY SHELTER BEDS AT THREE HOUSING RESOURCES WE HAVE ANALYZED WE NEED AND IDENTIFY THE GAPS. IT WILL ALSO PINPOINT HOW MANY PEOPLE WE EXPECT TO EXIT STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONS INTO HOMELESSNESS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PREVENT THAT HOMELESSNESS. NAMING AND HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TOUR TOOK A THINLY SOURCED AND FILLING GAPS. IN IT SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER FOR CALIFORNIA. NEXT EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRES THE STATE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PUT IN PLACE CALLED **** FINALLY EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN THIRTY GOALS FOR EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT DO THE HARD WORK OF COLLABORATING BY PURGING INVESTMENTS AND REFORMING PUBLIC. THE ONLY WAY TO MEET THE VOTER AND LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY ALL COMMENTS NO IT'S A DEDICATE CALIFORNIANS CAN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN IS TO CALL HER BACK ON HER ALL HANDS ON DECK CAN STOP THIS CRISIS.

IN ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE URBAN COUNTY CALIFORNIA AND WILL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE EIGHTY EIGHT ONE SIX I HAVE BEEN JUST WITH A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO THE OPERATING COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION WHEN SHARING THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS AND AGREE THAT PLANNING IS A MAJOR PART OF THE CHEATING MEASURABLE AND SUSTAINED PROGRESS. FOR THAT REASON WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORS AND STAFF LAST YEAR ON THE SIMILAR BILL EIGHTY THIRTY TO SIXTY NINE. AFTER MANY VALUABLE CONVERSATIONS WE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION TO LAST YEAR'S BILL WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN. UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT CONTINUE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE STAND READY TO FULLY ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE THIS YEAR IN HOPES OF REACHING SIMILAR COMMON GROUND. GENERALLY OUR CONCERN WITH EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN IS THAT IT FALLS SHORT OF BEING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. I NEED TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF CLEARLY ARTICULATED GOALS DEFINED ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT COMMENSURATE ONGOING FUNDING TO BUILD THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS. AND TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTEEN INCLUDE THE MANDATE PERTAINING TO ARTICULATE GOALS BY SPECIFYING A CLEANING PROCESS IN REDUCTION TARGET. IT ALSO INCLUDES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THROUGH ESTABLISHING A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL IN THE COURT INTERVENTION PROCESS. HOWEVER THE MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE OTHER ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED OUTCOME THAT BEING SAID WE REALIZED THAT NIGHT GAVE A DYNAMIC AND EVOLVING CONVERSATION WITH THE HOMELESSNESS BUDGET TRAILER BILL NEGOTIATIONS ALSO OCCURRING AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE GAME MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. THAT WE ENJOYED LAST YEAR THANK YOU. GREAT MR MEMBERS G. JASON RILEY IN CAL CITY. I THINK THE OPPORTUNE TO ADD TO SPEAK TODAY. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- ONGOING. TO HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE STATE TACKLE THIS CRITICAL ISSUE THAT BEFORE ALL THIS ABOUT THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE REGIONAL CHAMPION ON THE DEPRECIATED EFFORTS- WE ACTUALLY STRONGLY AGREE WITH WITH HIM AND THE NEW YORK COUNTY COUNTERPARTS AND OTHERS. ABOUT THE NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT THE GAP ANALYSIS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE CITY LANE WHAT'S THE COUNTY WHEN WHAT STATE WILL. YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU SOLVE HOMELESSNESS AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO KNOW IS WE CANNOT DO THIS. IN ISOLATION IT CAN'T JUST BE CITY IT CAN'T JUST BE COUNTING THE CABINET STATE. THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS TOGETHER AND THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITY THAT CERTAINLY COMMITTED. TO BEING A PART OF THAT SOLUTION- WE GREATLY APPRECIATE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE BUDGET AS FAR AS- YOU KNOW YOU'RE MARKING A HISTORIC AMOUNT OF MONEY. FOR HOMELESSNESS WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE FUNDS. ARE ONGOING AND PERMANENT AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT- PAIRED WITH THOSE GAPS ANALYSIS PAIRED WITH ACTION PLAN. BUT THAT IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE. THE GOAL THAT WE ALL HAVE WHICH IS THAT IT'S AFFECTING MILLION ALMOST AT. A CALIFORNIA SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS- AND AS WE WERE FINE WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT. OF STATUTES THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WE ALL KNOW THE DETAILS MATTER- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THOSE DETAILS. BECAUSE I HOPE AT THE END AND WE CAN COME TO A COMPROMISE AND UNDERSTAND THAT. THEY CAN'T JUST BE A HOLDING PERIOD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THINGS THAT THEY DON'T CONTROL WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE THE KIND OF WHAT WE DO CONTROL. AND A KEY PART OF THAT IS ENSURING WE HAVE ACCURATE AND DEDICATED PLANS AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES ON GOING AND PERMIT. THE SUPPORTERS PLANNED- AND WITH THAT- WE HAVE WHICH WE AVEN'T BECAUSE LAST MINUTE DECISION NOW WHAT WE LOOK FOR DISCONTINUE DISCUSSIONS IN APPRECIATED. SUMMER SEPARATES THANK YOU.

WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR REALLY. TACKLING A HARD ISSUE IT'S GONNA BRING OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO ADD MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR DRESSING ONE OF THE VERY VERY BIGGEST ISSUES FACING OUR STATE SO I AM RECOMMENDING AN EYE ON THIS BILL- I SEE CENTRE CRITTERS HE DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT. BUT FOR NOW WE CAN HANDLE IT YET BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW CORN- BUT WE WILL. YOU CAN MOVE IN- HOPEFULLY AND I. WILL GET ONE MORE MEMBER WHAT THE CURRENT- SO IF SOME MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN LEE JUST THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH US ON THIS BILL AND- LET ME JUST SAY FEW NOTES- BASED ON WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID FIRST OF ALL. WE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM PUBLIC COMMENT THAT THERE IS. A LITTLE BIT OF A- DIFFERENCE OF PERSPECTIVE FROM- FROM CITIES THAT SUPPORT THIS BILL- THAT ARE IN MANY INSTANCES REPRESENTING CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING. TO GRAPPLE WITH HOMELESSNESS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA ADDRESSES UNLESS ALL CITIES. OR COUNTIES AND ALL STATE AGENCIES ARE ENGAGED- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION FROM. SOME OF THE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING OTHER CITIES. AND I JUST WAN TO SAY A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING OUT. TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS A HISTORIC UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF MONEY. FOR HOMELESSNESS AND THE NUMBER ONE THING I HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES. IS AS WE DO THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. AND REAL DATA DRIVEN UNDERSTANDINGS OF HOW THAT MONEY CAN BE PUT TO GOOD USE BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS. WE SPEND TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN SHORT ORDER. AND AT THE END OF THAT DAY. IF HOMELESSNESS DOES NOT DROP. WE WILL BE ONE. WHY WE DIDN'T REQUIRE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS MEASURE IS REALLY CHEAP DISPELS REALLY TRYING TO. TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT- THAT- I HEAR THE SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE HOLDING CITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESOURCES. THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE AND I CAN AGREE WITH THAT MORE WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT CITIES CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TACKLE IT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS REALLY. ANALYZE WHAT IS THE GAP BETWEEN- THE LEVELS OF HOMELESSNESS IN ANY CITY OR COUNTY- AND REGION. AND WHAT RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS IT- AND WE WOULD REALLY ONLY BE ASKING CITIES AND COUNTIES. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE. BUT IT'S ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT'S IMPORTANT IS TO KNOW THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT. WE NEED TO REVERSE THIS WHAT WE HAVE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES SO- ENCLOSING EVERYONE KNOWS. THIS IS THE MORAL CRISIS OF THE DAY. WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESSING THAT AND WITH THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN OF THE STUFF FOR. THANK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER- AND WE WILL TAKE THIS UP PROMOTION ABOUT ONCE WE ESTABLISH OUR QUORUM- SO SOME RICHER YOU HAVE A SECOND BILL ITEM NUMBER ONE. EIGHTY TWO ONE FIVE AND YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THIS BILL WOULD PROVE IMPROVE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CITIES WHERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN UNDERPERFORMING. ALL OF US PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT CITIES DON'T BUILD HOUSING BUT THEY HAVE A CRITICAL ROLE IN ITS PRODUCTION FROM SONY LAND TO ESTABLISHING BUILDING STANDARDS TO PREVENT PROJECTS AN EIGHTY TWO FIFTEEN WOULD MAKE SURE THAT CITY'S ACTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE IN FACILITATING. THE HOUSING THEY PLANNED FOR IN THEIR HOUSE AND ELEMENTS AND THROUGH THE RENEWAL PROCESS IN THREE WAYS FIRST REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE A MID CYCLE CONSULTATION WITH EACH CD. IF THEIR OVERALL OR FOR MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS UNDER THE REGIONAL AVERAGE. SECOND THE BILL REQUIRES CITIES WHERE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY ELOW THE REGIONAL AVERAGE TO ADOPT LOCAL POLICIES THAT ENABLE EIGHT CITIES PROPOSING DESIGNATION. THIRD THE BILL ADDS THE HOUSING CRISIS ACTIVE TWENTY NINETEEN PASSED BY OUR RESPECTIVE HOUSES TO THE LIST OF STATE HOUSING LAWS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN ENFORCE. COMBINED THESE THREE ACCOUNTABILITY STRATEGIES WILL BETTER ENSURE THE ALIGNMENT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOALS TOWARDS THE CREATION OF HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. AND CHIPPING AWAY AT OUR MULTI MILLION. HOUSING UNIT DEFICIT. APPRECIATE THE BILLS SUPPORTED BY WIDE COALITION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES AS WELL AS HOUSING PRODUCTION STAKEHOLDERS WERE ALL INTERESTED IN SEEING. THE COST OF HOUSING BECOME OR THE PRICE OF HOUSING BECOME MORE ATTAINABLE. AND AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO. TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESS MARINA WINE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. IT GOOD AFTERNOON RAN AWAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR EIGHTY TWO FIFTEEN WHICH INCREASES THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF CITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND ARE EFFECTIVE AT FACILITATING HOUSING PRODUCTION BUILDING ON THE EFFORTS OF EIGHTY SEVENTY TWO OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH WE ALSO CO SPONSORED AB TWO FIFTEEN TAKES ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS ENSURING EVERY REGION IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING THEIR HOUSING GOALS. ABC FIFTEEN MAINTAINS THAT LEVEL FLEXIBILITY BUT INCREASES OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT LOCAL PLANTS ARE EFFECTIVE THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO KEEP TABS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION BUT WILL ALSO OFFER TIMELY TARGETED SUPPORT TO JURISDICTIONS FALLING BEHIND OUR HOUSING TARGETS HELPING EVERY COMMUNITY STAY ON TRACK TO BUILD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIANS FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE TO SUPPORT TODAY.

OKAY WILL NOW GO TO OPPOSITION TO AB TWO ONE FIVE- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TO THE OPPOSITION WHEN IT SAYS VALERIE FELDMAN FROM THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT. AND JASON RYAN FROM LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. HI THIS IS VALERIE FELDMAN FROM THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT JOINED OUR OPPOSITION LETTER TO EIGHTY TWO ONE FIVE. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN ADVOCACY REGARDING HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AND DOZENS OF JURISDICTIONS AND HAVE BEEN A PART OF SUCCESSFUL ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. INCLUDING LITIGATION THAT HAS RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF LAND REZONED TO ACCOMMODATE THE JURISDICTIONS LOWER INCOME HOUSING NEEDS. AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS THAT FACILITATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION THIS INCLUDES ACTIONS IN THE COUNTIES OF SHASTA HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO SACRAMENTO AND FRESNO. AND THE CITIES OF RIVERSIDE FOLSOM FRESNO AND THE NEEDED CLOTHING AND MORE. WE HAVE BOTH EIGHTY TWO FIFTEEN FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST FOR MY YEARS OF HOUSING ELEMENT ADVOCACY I'VE LEARNED THAT EFFECTIVE LAND USE LAWS INCLUDE SPECIFIC PROPHECIES. SPECIFIC CRITERIA AND SPECIFIC DEADLINES THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE THOSE CRUCIAL SPECIFICS. SECOND ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS THE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW IS THE OBLIGATION TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC INCLUDING A DILIGENT EFFORT TO INCLUDE PEOPLE FROM ALL INCOME LEVELS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO SEEK INPUT FROM THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE HOUSING CRISIS TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THEIR HOUSING NEEDS. THERE IS NO PUBLIC PROCESS REQUIRED BY THIS BILL AND NOTIFY MECHANISM FOR THE PEOPLE MOST AFFECTED BY THE HOUSING ELEMENT EFFECTIVENESS. TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO THE PROPOSED PROCESS. AND LASTLY THE BILL IS NOT AN EFFICIENT USE OF ACT'S RESOURCE AND TIME OR DEATH. THE BILL CAST A VERY WIDE DEBT THAT MIGHT SUBJECT YOUR ADDICTION TO A REVIEW WHEN THERE MAY BE FACTORS OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL THAT DIMINISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS HOUSING ELEMENT PROGRAM. TEMPERATURES SECTIONS WHERE THAT IS NOT THE CASE. ATV ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY AND NOW THE STAFFING TO REMEDY ANY FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT. IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MR HERE MEMBERS CHASING RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. I HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE CAPTIVES OPPOSING BOTH OF MR XI'S BILLS TODAY- BUT UNFORTUNATELY YES WE ARE CLOSE TO EIGHTY TWO ONE FIVE- YOU KNOW OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS MEASURE IS THAT IT TRYING TO TRANSFORM. AN INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM WHICH IS THAT PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION PROGRAM. OVER EACH CD INTO A PUNITIVE APPROACH WHERE OUR CITIES WE MANDATED TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS BASED ON ANOTHER PERFORMANCE THAT- HOW DO PRODUCTION I BE LIKE OUR LAST WITNESS THAT MENTION B. WELL BEYOND THEIR CONTROL- THIS IS THE- INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OTHERS ON. JUST TWO SHORT YEARS AGO- AND THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET- IN OUR CITIES HAVEN'T EVEN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROACTIVELY SEEK THIS CALL OUT THE DESIGNATION. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE GREATER COMPETITIVENESS WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN PARTS OF FUNDING. I'M VERY CENTRAL TO THE CREATION ALL HORRIBLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO UNFORTUNATELY WITH WITH THE- TRANSFORMATION THAT PROGRAM WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE AS IT IS NOW- ADDITIONALLY WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE MID CYCLE REVIEW THE ENHANCEMENT OF THAT- THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE MEASURE NOW- I CAN SAY THOUGH THAT THE ASSEMBLY OVER STAFF- HAS BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO REACH OUT TO US AND THAT NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION WITH THIS WRITER ROOMS THAT THIS COMMITTEE. I'M OVER THE SUMMER AND THEN AS WE NEAR THE END OF THE SESSION. IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN COME TO SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE AND PERHAPS LEAD THAT INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM UNTOUCHED. AND THEN MAYBE FOCUS MORE ON ON WHAT COULD BE SOME APPROPRIATE MID CYCLE. REVIEWS WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR AS TO SUBJECT OUR CITIES TO YET ANOTHER HOUSING ELEMENT BASICALLY FOR A YEAR'S END. TO THE EXISTING IN YOUR CYCLE. AND WITH THAT WE- OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU SIR.

OKAY- WILL NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. COLLEAGUES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BILL. OKAY SENDER BATES A YES ON TO THE AUTHOR. FAMILY MEMBER TO FIVE I DON'T CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION THAT USED TO BE VOLUNTARY I FIGURED IT TO BE SOMETHING IN TO INCENTIVIZE AND NOW IT'S MANDATED AND ALMOST SEEMS PUNITIVE COULD YOU GIVE A LITTLE- BROADER EXPLANATION OF WHY. WE HAVE THAT AS SOMETHING THAT EACH CD COMES DOWN IN CITIES ABOUT. THIS SEEMS TO BE KIND OF OUT OF CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO MOVE OUR CITIES IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND LOOK FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES TO- NEED RAIN NINE AND OUR CERTAINLY. OUR BALANCE OF HOUSING IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. CERTAINLY SO A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AGAIN FOR THIS BILL AS WE KNOW WE ARE ASKING. THE STATE AND CITIES TO PUT A TON OF TIME AND- TO DEVELOPING HOUSING ELEMENTS IN RENO. AND ONCE HOUSING HOMES ARE DOTTED BASICALLY. NO ONE REALLY LOOKS AT THEM AGAIN FOR EIGHT YEARS TO SEE IF CITIES ARE DOING. WHAT THEY HAD PLANNED TO DO SO WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS IS REALLY REALLY BAD. WHAT PART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING IS FOR CITIES THAT ARE WOEFULLY UNDERPERFORMING IN THAT AREA- WE WANT THEM TO ACHIEVE THE PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION WITH THE PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION DOES IS. IT SAYS THE CITIES THAT ARE DOING A GOOD JOB IN THIS AREA YOU ARE GOING TO GET IF I COULD PUT IT THIS WAY. CARATS INCENTIVES ARE TO MOVE FORWARD- THOSE WOULD INCLUDE- BEING ABLE TO- TO POTENTIALLY GET MORE FOR MORE FUNDING- AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE MOVE THIS FORWARD AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TO THE WORST PERFORMING CITIES. WE WANT YOU TO STRIVE WITH THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION ALLOWS TO STRIVE TO DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE- THAT YOU'RE BUILDING THE HOUSING THAT YOU ARE NOW ALL THAT BEING SAID I WANT TO STATE THIS. OUT TO YOU AND TO OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE WAY. TO UTILIZE WHAT HAPPENED THE CARROTS THE INCENTIVES OF THE PRESENT AS A NATION AND REALLY MOVE EVERYONE FORWARD. THAT CONVERSATION IS ONGOING AND I'M COMMITTING TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHO REALLY REALLY WANT TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HOW TO USE TO YOUR POINT WHAT HUSBAND STRUCTURED AS SORT OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. AS A WAY TO MOVE EVERYONE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE WANT ALL CITIES TO BE PRO HOUSE IN CITIES IDEALLY EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. GETS THE DESIGNATION BUT- AT THE MOMENT IT'S ONLY THOSE CITIES THAT. LET'S SAY THE BEST PERFORMING CITIES THAT WILL GET IT. AND THEN WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER CITIES THAT LOAN AND AGAIN PART OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT SORT OF BRIDGES PUSHES. THOSE WORST PERFORMANCE CITIES TO MOVE FOR. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND IT JUST SEEMS TO BE UPSIDE DOWN TO ME IT WOULD BE TO ME HAVING SERVED AT. BOTH LEVELS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNTY FOR pA LOT OF DEVELOPMENT WAS GOING ON DURING MY TERM. IN OFFICE AND ALSO- AS A FOUNDING. MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND NOW I'M- SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY WHERE YOU KNOW DEVELOPMENT WAS SIGN GOING- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THOSE THAT ARE UNDER PERFORMING DON'T DO THAT PURPOSEFULLY. THAT THERE ARE OBSTACLES WITCHER FEES FIVE AND THE REGULATIONS PUT ON THEM BY THE STATE. OF THEY'RE THE ONES THAT SHOULD BE INCENTIVISED A IF OTHERS ARE MEETING AT HIM GETTING A DESIGNATION OF PRO HOUSING IS PROBABLY LIKE GETTING AN H. AND THEY'RE ALREADY PERFORMING AT THAT LEVEL AND YOU'RE GIVING THE OTHER GUYS YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP AN ELF. SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT. YOU WERE KIND OF RE LOOK AT THAT- I CAN'T SUPPORT IT TODAY. AGAIN HAVING SERVED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT IDEA AND WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTEEN. THERE IS- COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN VIEW OF WHAT OUR CITIES TRY TO DO AND THE OBSTACLES THAT ARE PLACED ON. IN FRONT OF THEM USUALLY BY SOME. RATHER A- MISUNDERSTANDING A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH. TO WHAT'S GOING OUT. ON OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES- EIGHT THE WORK YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE IT IS. A NOBLE CAUSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE HOUSE. HOUSING FOR PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS THAT TOM I JUST SEE IT SOMEWHAT UPSIDE DOWN SINCE I WAS AT THE- BELIEVE IF YOU WILL WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT CHILD INCORPORATED AND DEVELOPED IN AND PROVIDED INCREDIBLE. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AT EVERY LEVEL WE APPROACH THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU AND IN THE DAYS THAT WOULD BE IN IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES AS A PLANNED COMMUNITY PLAN RECOGNIZED BY. CONGRESS AT THAT TIME AS ONE OF THE BEST APPROACHES TO. URBAN LAND PLANNING- WHICH PROVIDED OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU COULD LIVE WORK AND- PLAY AND YOUR COMMUNITY GOES TO ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH NOW. AND THAT IS BEEN KIND OF LOST OVER THE YEARS THAT SHOULD BE REVISITED. BUT THANK YOU AGAIN AND I MEAN NO DISRESPECT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY SEEING NONE- WE- OR ONE SORT OF A QUORUM ARE ALMOST THERE- AND WE WILL TAKE THIS UP FOR THE MOTION IN A VOTE WHEN WE SEE A CAR ON A SEMI NUMBER YOU MAKE ONCE AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATING GAUGE ON ON THIS THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE I THINK AGAIN I THINK THE GOAL FOR ALL OF US IS TO MAKE ALL OF OUR CITIES TO BE PRO HUSING CITIES- DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEW PRO HOUSING DESIGNATION IS RELATIVELY NEW SO- WE'RE WORKING TO THESE ISSUES BUT AS FAR AS PARTICULAR OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BILL. VERY MUCH SO WE CAN MOVE ALL THIS FORWARD AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SUPPORT AT THE RIGHT TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY I SEE THAT AS A MEMBER WARDERS HERE SO WE WILL PROCEED TO ITEM NUMBER. SIX EIGHTY FOUR NINETY ONE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS EIGHTY FOUR NINE ONE SIX TO CLARIFY A STATEWIDE STANDARD TO ENSURE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO COMMON ENTRANCES AREAS AND AMENITIES AS MARGAERY HOUSING RESIDENTS CURRENTLY SOME DEVELOPERS ARE SEEKING TO BUILD A HOUSING STRUCTURE CONTAINING BOTH MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THEY HAVE SOUGHT TO CONSTRUCT THAT STRUCTURE WITH SEPARATE COMMON ENTRANCES COMMON AREAS OR COMMON AMENITIES FOR EACH SET OF OCCUPANTS. ONE RECENT EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT IN SAN DIEGO WOULD HAVE CREATED SEPARATE ENTRANCES AND RESTRICTED CERTAIN AMENITIES INCLUDING A POOL AND A ROOFTOP DECK TO ONLY THE RESIDENTS OF MARKET RATE UNITS IN EFFECT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXCEEDING AFFORDABLE UNIT RESIDENCE. AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE MORE MAKES DUNK IT IN MIXED INCOME HOUSING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO BE EXPLICITLY CLEAR AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS WHILE THE SAN DIEGO PROJECT WAS REVISED IT DEPENDED ON PUBLIC PRESSURE RATHER THAN CLEAR EXISTING LAW TO STOP THE PLAN DISCRIMINATION. EIGHTY FOUR NINE ONE SIMPLY AN EXPLICITLY CLARIFIES THAT RESIDENTS OF AFFORDABLE UNITS IN A MIXED INCOME MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT MUST HAVE THESAME ACCESS TO COMMON ENTRANCES AREAS AND AMENITIES AS THE OCCUPANTS OF MARKET RATE UNITS.

FIVE ZERO OKAY WE'LL PUT THAT ON COVER OF THE MEMBERS OKAY A SUMMONER FREEMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE- WELCOME THE HOUSING COMMITTEE- WE'LL BE HEARING ITEM TEN EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT AND YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE ALL KNOW THAT BUILDING CODES ARE INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT BUILDINGS ARE SAFE FOR THEIR INHABITANTS. AND ENFORCEMENT OF THESE CODES IS EXPRESSIONLESS CRITICAL IN MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WHERE TENANTS HAVE A LIMITED ABILITY TO THEMSELVES CORRECT ANY HEALTH OR SAFETY PROBLEMS THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS BILL FOR ME WAS READING A ARTICLE IN THE LA S. MAGAZINE ABOUT SOME SOME REAL SLUM PROPERTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT THE TENANTS WERE FORCED TO DO THINGS LIKE USE ILLEGAL SPACE HEATERS THE WIRING WAS BAD IN THE BUILDING. A FIRE ENSUED AND CHILDREN WERE KILLED IN THIS FIRE AND THESE WERE TENANTS WHO WERE POWERLESS TO COMPEL THE SAFETY ON THE ROAD AND MAKING IT WORSE THE BUILDING OFFICIALS IN THAT CITY WE'RE NOT DOING CODE ENFORCEMENT ON THIS PROPERTY THE UNFORTUNATE FACT IS THAT WE STILL HAVE A FEW CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT PUT PRE CONDITIONS ON TENANTS. BEFORE THEY WILL DO INSPECTIONS ABOUT SAFETY VIOLATIONS SOMETIMES THOSE PRECONDITIONS SAID THAT THE TENANTS HAVE TO BE CURRENT ON ALL THEIR RENT BEFORE THE LOOK AT WHETHER THE BUILDING IS SAFE OR THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVE PROVE THAT THEY HAD GONE TO THE LANDLORD FIRST NONE OF THAT'S ABOUT HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT ALL THAT THEY SHOULD CARE ABOUT IS ENSURING THAT EVERY SINGLE UNIT IS SAFE. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT PROHIBITS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA FROM PLACING RESTRICTIONS OR PRECONDITIONS BEFORE RESPONDING. TO COMPLAINTS OF HABITABILITY ISSUES THESE ARE SERIOUS SAFETY COMPLAINTS. AB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT. CREATE ANY NEW DUTIES OR RESPONSIBILITIES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I DON'T EXPECTED TO INCLUDE IT AND CHANGED IT OR INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IN CALIFORNIA. ALL IT DOES IS SAY THAT THEY CAN'T PRECONDITION. INSPECTIONS ON IT ON THE TENANT. NOW WITH ATTENDED ENTERS A CONTRACT WITH THE LANDLORD IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAND IT'S GOING TO BE THEIR FIRST LINE. OF CONTACT IF THEY HAVE AN ISSUE AT A. B. EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE THAT UNDERLYING FACT. OUR OFFICE HAS HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH REALTORS AND THE REPRESENTATIVES FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. TO RESOLVE THE ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE ABOUT COST RECOVERY THAT PROPERTY OWNERS BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE COST OF INSPECTIONS THAT DON'T REVEAL VIOLATIONS. WE AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE AMENDED THIS BILL TO STATE. THAT PROPERTY OWNERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AN INSPECTION. AND LESS THE INSPECTION REVEALS A MATERIAL AND SUBSTANTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE. THAT IS STANDARD PRACTICE AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND IT IN ALMOST ALL OF OUR CITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT. CONTINUES UNDER THIS BILL. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY OR CYNTHIA CASTILLO FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND BRIAN AUGUSTA FROM THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR. RESIDENTS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I VOTE. I THANK YOUR SUMMER AND MONEY I NEGLECT TO.

COURTESY WELL I'VE GOTTA SAY I'VE ACQUIRED. A CHORE BOOK. MUCH OF A DOUBT THAT IN. SKINNER SKINNER I AM BURKE HI NUMBER FIVE WITH CASKEY. FOUR TO ONE THEY WILL PUT THAT BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS BOBBY FORGET OUR NEXT SET OF JUST AS A REMINDER FOR ANYONE WHO WAS NOT ON THE LINE AT THE BEGINNING. ITEM TWELVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN AT TEN FORTY THREE HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE HAIR PULLED FROM THE AGENDA TODAY AND WILL BE RESET FOR NEXT WEEK'S HEARING TEST SO NO ONE IS WAITING AROUND FOR A GIRL THE STOPPING HER TODAY. WHEN X. GO TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN MAYBE TEN TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BALIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELCOME AND YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU MR MEMBERS WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. ONE OF THE LESSER KNOWN CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ISSUE IS THE EXPIRATION OF SO CALLED. AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS. WHEN CALIFORNIA HAD REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE AGENCY. WERE REQUIRED TO RECORD CONFIDENCEON THE PROPERTY THAT WE GUARANTEE. THAT THOSE UNITS WOULD REMAIN AFFORDABLE AT BELOW MARKET RATES. FOR THIRTY YEARS AND IN SOME INSTANCES FIFTY YEARS. AS TIME PASSES MANY OF THOSE COVENANTS REACH THEIR TIME LIMITS AND EXPIRE. AS THOSE TIME LIMITS EXPIRE. THE UNIT MAY THEN BE LEASED AT MARKET RATE. AS HE CAN- RESETS THE MARKET RATE THAT IS ONE LESS AFFORDABLE UNIT THAT IS AVAILABLE TO A LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. MAYBE TEN TWENTY NINE SIMPLY ASK THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO ADD PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. TO THEIR LIST OF PRIORITIES FOR ALLOCATION OF STATE FUNDING. IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SAVE A UNIT FROM CONVERTED TO MARKET RATE THAN TO BUILD A BRAND NEW UNIT. THIS IS A SIMPLE YET IMPORTANT STEP TO MAINTAINING. CALIFORNIA'S SCARCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION ON THE BILL. YEAH WITH ME ON THE PHONE TODAY OUR MAYOR SANTIAGO HONEY THE MAYOR OF FOSTER CITY. AND BARBARA GORE SAID HE RETIRED RESIDENT OF FOSTER'S. LANDING BARBER SAID HE IS- A RESIDENT OF- FOSTER CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A FAMILY MEMBER WILL NOW GO TO THE LEAD WHEN IT SAYS WILL START MAYOR HANI. FOLLOWED BY BARBARA CASSETTI YOU'LL EACH HAVE. TWO MINUTES WELCOME TO THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME. HI MR SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MR SHARED MEMBERS- MY NAME IS SANJAY GANDHI I'M THE MAYOR OF FOSTER CITY I WANT TO BEGIN BY THINKING OF SOMETHING THE MEMO AND PREPARING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION BOSSIDY HAD A VERY ACTIVE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND WHAT SUCCESSFUL IN CREATING HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR- CITIES PRODUCT THAT OUR EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN A CITY OF ABOUT. THIRTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY TOTAL UNITS. WHEN THE FOSTERS LANDING APARTMENT DEVELOPMENT WAS BUILT IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES IT INCLUDED SEVENTY FOUR BELOW MARKET RATE RENTAL UNITS IN THE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY UNIT DEVELOPMENT. THE PMR RESTRICTIONS WERE DUE TO EXPIRE BEGINNING WITH FIFTY UNITS WELL LAST YEAR ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. THE REMAINING TWENTY FOUR UNITS- ART BASED EXPIRED VARIOUS TIMES WITH THE FINAL TEN UNITS EXPIRING ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. BUT THE TRICKIEST ARE SET TO EXPIRE LAST YEAR THE CITY IN THE PROPERTY OWNER AGREED TO EXTEND THE PORTABLE BRANCH TO THE BASE TO THESE TENANTS UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE CITY ALLOCATED MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY THE CITY SHARE OF THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER AT THE END OF THIS YEAR THE RESIDENTS OF FOSTER'S LANDING WILL SEE THEIR RENTAL FROM A TYPICAL FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO ABOUT THIRTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. NOW FOSTER CITY HAS TAKEN SEVERAL STEPS TO ASSIST THE TENANTS OF FOSTER'S LANDING AT ALL RESIDENTS OF OUR CITY TO LIVE IN. OR LOOKING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE FORMER HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA WILL HAVE LITTLE TURNOVER AND LONG WEIGHTLESS. PRESERVATION OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN ADDRESSING THE EXISTING HOUSING CRISIS. WE WILL NEVER GET AHEAD OF THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IF WE'RE UNABLE TO PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN UNITS. ALREADY HAVE.

IDO HAVE A QUESTION I SUPPORT THE BILL BUT AN- SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE- I'M COMPLETELY AWARE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE MANY OF THE- LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING- MUCH IN THE LONG TERM IN MANY OF OUR CITIES. HAS THESE. YEARS SPECIFIC YOUR COVENANTS I THINK I FORGET WHAT THE ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY UNITS. SKIS ME IN BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE BUT UNDER THIS IT GIVES- PRIORITY IF THE CITY DESIGNATED SELF AS DESCRIBED THEN THEY WOULD HAVE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE FUNDING PROGRAMS AT THE STATE- HAS AVAILABLE THAT IS THE STRETCH MY FIRST QUESTION IS THAT ACCURATE AND THEN. IS THE REMEDY- IS THE ONLY ISRAEL ONLY REMEDY THAT JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO MAKE THESE UNITS LONGER TERM AFFORDABLE IS TO PURCHASE THEM. SO. SO THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- YES THERE ARE SOME THIRTY PLUS THOUSAND UNITS- OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT ARE THREATENED TO USE TO FLIP INTO MARKET RATE IS SIMPLY ADDS PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS TO- THE LIST OF- ELEMENTS THAT BC HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- CONSIDERS IN TERMS OF FINDING- TO THE KEYS CAN CAN WE CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP FIND- THE GAP. THAT WILL EXIST- BUT CANDIDLY- BUT THE FUNDING IS TO FOR THE JURISDICTION TO PURCHASE THE HOUSING RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY REAL REMEDY TAKEN TO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE SAID. STATION BUT WHAT HAPPENS. RIGHT OKAY THREE YEAH RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY CENTER SCANNER- IT SAID WHILE IT IS SAYS IS POINT OUT YOU KNOW THIS IS- IN MOST CASES NOT ALL LESS EXPENSIVE IF YOU CAN GET THE AGREEMENT WITH TO PURCHASE THEM- COMPARED TO NEW CONSTRUCTION. IT'S STILL THIS IS A THIS IS DAUNTING SO I REALLY APPRECIATE I WISH THAT WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL REMEDY THAT WE COULD PROVIDE TO ENSURE THAT THESE UNITS STAY PORTABLE BUT I DO VERY MUCH SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS. AND THEN SENATOR IF I MAY- I'LL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A MODEST. APPROACH TO A VERY BIG PROBLEM THAT EXISTS SO I WOULD WELCOME- WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS TO SEE IF THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL. FINANCIAL OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE STATE OF THE AFFORDABLE COLUMN- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT GOING FOR BUT THIS AT LEAST PUTS UP. A BASELINE AND- INTO THE LAW THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT I USE OF STATE HOUSING FUNDS IN TERMS OF PRESERVATION BUT LOOK FOR ALL PUBLIC LOOKING FOR OTHER REMEDIES- WITH YOU ON THIS. THANK YOU FOR CALLING ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SOME REMEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF AND THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE CONVERSATION AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A VOTE. GREAT AND I AM RECOMMENDING AND I- AND THANK YOUR SUMMER NUMBER. THE MOTION BY SENATOR CORTEZ HE AND WE WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS A SUMMARY BILL TEN TWENTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR WIENER. WIENER I'D BATES NOT VOTING IT'S NOT VOTING COPYRIGHT. COPYRIGHT COURTESY COURTESY I'M ACQUIRE. A CHORE BOOK. THE TROUBLED NOTE SCANNER BY SKINNER HI AMBER HI AMBER WHAT KASKY. FIVE TO ONE. WE'LL PUT OUT A CALL FOR ACTION MEMBERS THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER WE HAVE OUR FINAL AUTHOR HERE TODAY SO MEMBERS BLOOM WHO WILL BE PRESENTING TWO BILLS WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE. WELCOME SUMMER NUMBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SEEMS LIKE I JUST SAW YOU. LAST NIGHT. YEAH AND TO A SENATOR'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING WITH THE AMENDMENTS ON EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE AND I'LL BE ACCEPTING THEM AS COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL INVALIDATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVATE COVENANTS THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH LOCAL ZONING. UNTIL THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WERE USED AS A TOOL TO SEGREGATE. AND REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS. COURT DECISIONS AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE THANKFULLY AND- BUT THESE COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER VESTIGES OF THIS DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS LIMITS ON THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNITS THAT CAN BE BUILT ON A PARCEL. THE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS ALSO CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND DESPITE THEIR DISCRIMINATORY ORIGIN IN CLEAR CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING. THESE RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ENFORCEABLE AGAINST AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. SO THREATS OF LAWSUITS OVER THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO GET TITLE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND FUNDING FROM LENDERS IN THESE SITUATIONS THE TIME AND EXPENSE NEEDED TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS DETERRED DEVELOPERS FROM ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ON THESE OTHERWISE. IDEAL PROJECT SITES. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT THESE PRIVATE CONFIDENCE CANNOT BE USED TO CURTAIL MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN PRIVATE COVENANTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL ENSURE THAT WE BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING LOCAL CONTROL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORTR. BRANDON PAYETTE WITH PUBLIC COUNSEL AND HAY SEUSS HERNANDEZ WITH THE COMMUNITY CORPORATION OF SANTA MONICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOME REMEMBER WHEN I GO TO A LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES BRANDON. AND HIS IS HERNANDEZ YOU MAY PROCEED YOU'LL EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- MY NAME IS BRANDON PATH I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH PUBLIC COUNCIL THE NATION'S LARGEST PRO BONO LAW FIRM. ON THE FIRST THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ON ITS FACE EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE CENTS FOR A SIMPLE PROPOSITION AT A PROPERTY OWNER WANTS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE PROPERTY THAT THEY OWN THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD AS MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THEIR PROPERTY AS THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WILL PERMIT. AN OPENLY RACIST LAND DEVELOPERS FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES SHOULD HAVE NO SAY IN THIS DECISION. MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY OF RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM READING AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY OF THOSE RACIST RESTRICTIONS LIVES ON. RECORDED RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT CHRONIC GIVEN PARTIAL TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS. OR TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN TREATED AS ENFORCEABLE TODAY. EVEN IF THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE MORE LIMITING THE APPLICABLES OWNING CODE BY MANY SCHOOLS. EVEN IF THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTAINED IN THE SAME DOCUMENT. AS EXPLICITLY RACIST RESTRICTIONS ON WHO MAY LIVE THERE. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD MAKE THE PRIVATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN RECORDED COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. THEREBY REMOVING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE THIS HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED THEM. JUST IKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MODIFY EXPLICITLY RACIST RESTRICTIONS CURRENTLY CODIFIED IN CALIFORNIA LAW. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IMPLEMENT A NEAR IDENTICAL PROCESS FROM MODIFYING THESE PRIVATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL WOULD NOT MAKE NOR WOULD IT REQUIRE ANY CHANGES TO LOCAL ZONING CODES ON LAND USE RULES. SIMPLY ALLOW A PROPERTY OWNER TO BUILD AS MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A GIVEN PROPERTY AS THE ZONING CODE WOULD ALLOW. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL DOES NOT DO AWAY WITH RESTRICTIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THE PROPERTY NOT RELATED TO THE SITE. LOCATION OR NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE BUILT THERE WOULD REMAIN FULLY ENFORCEABLE AND EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE EXPLICITLY ALLOWS A LOCAL COMMUNITY. TO RETAIN ITS CHARACTER BY ENFORCING DESIGN AESTHETIC RESTRICTIONS OR BY IMPOSING MAINTENANCE FEES TO KEEP COMMON AREAS IN GOOD REPAIR. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO ENSURE THAT LEGITIMATE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND OTHER IMPORTANT CONSERVATION MEASURES THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT. REMAINS WE HAVE A PUBLIC COUNSEL ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE ON EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF RECTIFYING THE HARM OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. AND DISCRIMINATORY. HOUSING POLICIES. THANK YOU. AND THE NEXT WINNERS CAN START. SURE HI EVERYONE- GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE COUNCILMEMBERS BUT THE NUMBERS RATHER THIS IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN ON THAT I AM THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY CORPORATION OF SANTA MONICA WE ARE A MID SIZED NONPROFIT THAT HAS OPERATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE AFFLUENT WEST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. I HAD TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM PER CHILD FOR CHAMPION AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MANY YEARS HIS LEADERSHIP HAS CREATED MANY POLICIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO DO OUR WORK. AND INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. HE RECORDED HERE TODAY S A COLD SPONSOR OF AB SEVENTEEN TWENTY ONE. BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WE BELIEVE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH POLICY MAKERS OBSTACLES WE FACE. IN THE HOPES THEY CAN BE FIXED. THE ISSUES RAISED BY A B. SEVENTEEN. MY A. B. SEVEN TWENTY ONE ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PERPETRATE HISTORICAL SEGREGATION OF NEIGHBORHOODS. AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER I HAVE SEEN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS EXTREMELY THE RACIAL PROVISION. ALONG WITH ACCOMPANYING DENSITY DESTRUCTION MULTIPLE TIMES USUALLY I HAVE CHOSEN TO WALK AWAY FROM THE NEWS ABOUT THE BIKE BUT AFTER THE EVENTS. OF THE PAST YEAR I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO CHALLENGE THAT IT WILL. TAKE AWAY THE POWER. AT THE SECOND GUESSING THAT THE COMPANY HAD LET. TO REMOVE SUCH COVENANTS CAN COST A LOT OF MONEY AND EXPAND THE COURT PROCESS THE PROPERTY'S ALREADY LONG OR DESIGNATED FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WE BELIEVE. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT- THAT PROCESS. IN MONDAY BUT I MEAN WE ARE WORKING ON CURRENTLY THE PROPERTY IS. DESIGNATED MULTI FOUNDED BY THE CITY. AND THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY AND THE PRIVATE ALL STANDING COVENANT AMONG PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE NINETEEN FORTY. EIGHT TO PROHIBIT MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS. IT WILL PROVIDE OVER A HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS A NOBLE OUR DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY. THANKS TO THE MANY COMPANIES RECORDED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE OUR COSPONSORED PUBLIC COUNSEL WHETHER SPLAINE MORE ABOUT THE COVENANT AND HAS WORKED VERY HARD. TO HELP US THROUGH THIS PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN. BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

I SEE THE BAD STUFF THAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE- PRIVATE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND WE WANT TO WE WANT TO. OUTLAW THEM- AND THE BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT THEY'RE UNENFORCEABLE. IF THE IF THE PROPERTY IS DEVELOPED AT A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THERE'S A FIFTY FIVE YEAR DEED RESTRICTION. IF WE WANT TO GET RID OF THE RESTRICTED WOULDN'T IT BE MORE INCLUSIVE EFFORT SAY THE DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL IS 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR 40% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN ST IF YOU IF YOU APPLY. THAT TYPE OF- OF- MAKE THAT TYPE OF APPLICATION THESE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS GO AWAY. IF I IF I THINK OF A VENDOR STAND THE HARM THAT WE SEE IN THESE RESTRICTED PRIVATE COVENANTS IS SORT OF OUR DESIRABILITY TO WANT TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SOME RUMOR. WELL I WISH THAT- THINGS WOULD BE SO SIMPLE- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT ON ITS SURFACE- LOOKS LIKE AN EASY SLAM DUNK BUT IT RAISED OTHER ISSUES THAT TOOK. MANY MANY HOURS OF NEGOTIATION- HE BILL PRIORITIZES 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT CERTAINLY COULD BE LEFT TO THE FUTURE BILL TOO- TO EXPAND THAT- EVEN MARKET RATE HOUSING BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON IN SOME OF THESE- AREAS WHERE IT'S ZONED FOR MULTI FAMILY. WHY ONE WOULDN'T TO- NECESSARILY WANT TO BUILD THE MARKET RATE HOUSING. BUT THE PRIORITY HERE IS 1100% AFFORDABL AND- IT WAS THE BILL WAS BROUGHT TO US BY A SPONSOR. WHO ONLY DOES 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO THAT'S THE WAY THE REASON ADULT READS AWAIT US. CENTER CARRIER THE ONLY MOVE THE BILL. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTER CALERO ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- A SUMMARY OF MY CLOTHES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT'S JARRING TO- GREAT I READ A- A DEED FROM MANY YEARS AGO- AS I DID A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHEN I READ THE DEED ON MY PARENTS HOME. AND SEE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THERE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT AND CAN PERSONALIZE IT THAT WAY YOU- IT'S MUCH MORE. IT'S A MUCH MORE DEEPLY HURT BUT ALSO SPEAKS TO- WHERE WE ONCE WERE AND HOW FAR WE'VE COME- AND YET THIS BILL REMINDS US THAT THE VESTIGES OF- OF THOSE DEED RESTRICTIONS AND OF THAT. DISCRIMINATION STILL EXISTS TODAY AND THERE'S STILL THINGS WE CAN DO TO REPAIR THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN AND OUT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HERE I'VE BEEN. TAKEN A LONG. TIME THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER- WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR CAFIERO. I WILL CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS BILL SEVEN TWENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST DEMAND AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. SENATOR WIENER OUR WINNER I'D BATES NO BEDS NO COPYRIGHT HI COPYRIGHT- CORTICES. COURTESY I'M ACQUIRE. THE TROUBLE. THE TROUBLE NO SCANNER. BY SKINNER I REMEMBER ALL RIGHT NUMBER I. WOULD CASKEY HI THE CASKET I. SIX TO TWO CLICK ON CALL SOME NUMBERS THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER WILL NOW GO TO- YOUR SECOND BILL AND OUR FINAL BILL PRESENTATION OF THE DAY ITEM NUMBER NINE AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT- WHICH I. LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME SINCE I OFFERED THIS LAST YEAR AND IT DIED AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRST SO SUMMER THANK YOU FOR- FOR BRINGING THIS BACK AND YOU MAY PRESENT YOU HAVE YET A LITTLE MORE REPAIR WORK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU- AND I'D LIKE TO START WITH ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR AMENDMENTS ON A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND OF COURSE THANK THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE THE- CURRENTLY IF A JURISDICTION DOES NOT ADOPT THE HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE AND IT MUST. ADOPT A REVISED HOUSING ELEMENT. EVERY FOUR YEARS RATHER THAN EVERY EIGHT. THIS PENALTY FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT ADOPTION DEADLINES HAS PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. AND LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. FOR EXAMPLE UNDER CURRENT LAW A CITY OR COUNTY CAN ADOPT A LEGALLY DEFICIENT HOUSING ELEMENT. ALMOST FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE STATUTORY DEADLINE. WITH NO CONSEQUENCES. IN FACT SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED FAULTY DRAFT ELEMENTS BY THE DEADLINE. KNOWING THAT THE ADDITIONAL CHANGES AND REVISIONS WERE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. JUST TO AVOID A PENALTY OF HAVING TO REVISE THE ELEMENT IN FOUR YEARS. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THE ADOPTED ELEMENT WAS NOT REVISED TO CORRECT THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES FOR MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE DEADLINE. AND IN SOME CASES NOT FOR YEARS. FOR INSTANCE ONE CITY ADOPTED A DRAFT ELEMENT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND FOUND. DID NOT MEET STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS THE CITY TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION TO REMEDY THE LEGAL DEFICIENCIES UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN FIVE YEARS AFTER THE CITY WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPOSED TO ADOPT ITS ELEMENT. AB THIRTEEN NINETY EIGHT WOULD ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BY CLARIFYING THE LAW TO REQUIRE ADOPTION OF AN H. C. D. APPROVED HOUSING ELEMENT BY THE STATUTORY DEADLINE. THE BILL ELIMINATES THE FOUR YEAR PENALTY AND INSTEAD PROVIDES THAT FAILURE TO TALK TO ADOPT ONE TIME. OBLIGATES THE JURISDICTION TO COMPLETE ANY NECESSARY RESULTS WITHIN ONE YEAR RATHER THAN IN THE THREE YEARS THAT'S A LOT FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ADOPT ON TIME. MY WITNESS TODAY IS BRIAN AUGUSTA WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT. THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU THE SERVICE. TO THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS-THANK YOU MR BLOOM FOR OFFERING US INTO THE CHAIR FOR GETTING IT ALMOST TO THE FINISH LINE LAST YEAR- THE AUTHOR HAS EXPLAINED THAT THE GOAL OF THE BILL VERY WELL SO I WILL JUST USE THIS TIME TO URGE THE COMMITTEE.
