FORTY THREE EIGHTY FOUR SEVEN EIGHT THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER TANK THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MR CHAIR FOR ACCOMMODATING ME BECAUSE WE HAVE A BUDGET COMMITTEE COMING UP VERY VERY SOON. EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT ESTABLISHES A TIME FRAME FOR THERMOFORM FOOD PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS TO USE. MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT INTO PLASTIC CONTAINERS STARTING WITH 10% THE 202420% 202730% BY TWENTY THIRTY. THERMA FORMS ARE THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS THAT WILL YOU SEE IN GROCERY STORES AND STRAWBERRIES- SALADS OR LEAFY GREENS OR TAKE OUT CONTAINERS. RIGHT NOW ALL APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED POUNDS OF THERMOFORM WASTE ARE DISCARDED EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY GET RECYCLED MOST OFTEN ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THEY END UP IN LANDFILL LAST YEAR I WAS VERY PROUD TO WORK. WITH MY COLLEAGUE THE MEMBER- WENT ON A. B. SEVEN NINETY THREE TO ESTABLISH A- HISTORIC MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT FOR PAP PLASTIC BEVERAGE BOTTLES. THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER THAT- AND IT TURNED IT OVER TO HER TO DO A PRESENTATION THEN WE HAVE TO KEEP WITNESSES BOB. DAVID DUKE WHO IS THE CEO OF OUR PLANET EARTH AND SCOTT WILKERSON WITH. BOND DO FRESH AMERICANS. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND MY JOINT ASSEMBLYMEMBER. AV FOUR SEVEN EIGHT IS ANOTHER BIG STEP FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE LEAD IN CREATING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. IT PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO PULL OUT A HIGHLY RECYCLABLE MATERIAL FROM THE WASTE STREAM. AND THROUGH MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS CREATES A MARKET FOR THE MATERIAL FURTHER THE BILL INCREASES THE SUPPLY OF RECYCLED P. ET WHICH IS SEEING AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FROM SEVERAL INDUSTRIES. WHILE THERE REMAIN A FEW OUTSTANDING ITEMS TO ADDRESS WE ARE CONTINUING THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND THAT INCLUDES THE STRAWBERRY COMMISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO NUMBER ONE AS I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO WIN THIS IS ON THE PHONE MISTER BOB DAVID DOC. IN SCOTT WILKERSON- ARE ARE THE VIEW ON THE PHONE. HI THIS IS BOB WTF I'M ON ALL RIGHT THE DOUBLE DIP GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR- BERGEN MEMBERS- YOU KNOW ON BOB W. THE CO FOUNDER AND THE CEO OF THE COMPANY OUR PLANET EARTH. AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT- THANKS TO THE COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPITAL OUR PLANET EARTH. THE WORLD'S FIRST COMPLETELY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MANUFACTURER OF RECYCLED PET PACKAGING AND OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHECKING COPS. THAT ARE DERIVED FROM POST CONSUMER PET CONTAINERS BOTH BOTTLES AND THERMAL FORMS AN OFFICE BUILDING THAT IS LOCATED IN VERNON CALIFORNIA. AT THE PRESENT TIME THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION POUNDS OF POSTING SOME WITH SOME FORM OF ENTERTAINERS DISCARDED IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY YEAR AND GROWING. EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY WILL CREATE MARKETS. AND BECAUSE OF CONCERN CONFORM CONTAIN. WHICH WILL DIVERT THEM FROM LANDFILLS. THE BILL WILL COVER DON'T WANT CONTAINERS USED FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGES INCLUDING ITEMS SUCH AS PRODUCE VERY CLAM SHELL CONTAINERS SANDWICHING FINGERS OVER TOP SPOT. OWN TAKEOUT CONTAINERS AND DRINKING CUPS. PURCHASERS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN RESIN TYPES IN RECYCLED FORM THAT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE FDA'S REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD GRADE APPLICATIONS. IN ORDER TO USE RECYCLED MATERIALS AND DIRECT FOOD CONTACT APPLICATIONS THEY MUST BE SAFE. WHICH IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY OBTAINING A LETTER OF NON OBJECTION SO KNOWN AS THE NOW. ON A- FROM THE US FDA. 84% EIGHT ONE TO THE FOR FOOD STAPLE CONSUMER PRICE GLASS SUCH PEOPLE T. R. POLY PRO. THEY'RE BY ENCOURAGING RECYCLERS THAT DO NOT HAVETHE FDA'S DELANO DESIGNATION TO OBTAIN IT BECAUSE BRAND DEMAND WILL EXIST JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO COLLECT AND RECYCLE THE VARIOUS WEAPON TYPES. TO A FOOD GRADE QUALITY. THERE WAS AN ANTI PROVISION IN THIS BILL. WITH ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR ITS INCLUSION IS TO FOSTER COLLECTION AND ALLOW MANUFACTURERS TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF RECYCLED FROM A FORM. IN ORDER TO MEET THE RECYCLED CONTENT TARGETS. IN ADDITION THE PACKAGING MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO SET BAIL QUALITY STANDARDS NEEDED TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS PRECLUDES STATES FROM UP ONE CONTAINERS. THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE THERMAL FORMS FROM THE COMING OPERATE THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESS CONTAMINATION ISSUES ABOUT SEE YOUR DETAILS. AND ENCOURAGE THE COLLECTION OF FORMAL FORMS THAT WILL SEPARATELY BE BAILED. IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AVAILABILITY OF CLOSENESS TO MY RESIDENCE. WILL COME ABOUT MAYBE FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. I DON'T RECYCLE BECAUSE REQUIREMENT THAT SPUR DEMAND AND WE DON'T HIRE RATES A COLLECTION AND RECYCLING. THESE VALUABLE MATERIALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING LANDFILL. THE BILL ALSO CREATE JOBS THANK YOU SIR- ONE OF MANY PRE SHADER INPUT- ALL RIGHT.

AFTERNOON MISTER KERR MEMBERS SYMPATHETIC WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THEY STILL SEEK TO ACCOMPLISH HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE SOME AMENDMENTS ARE NECESSARY AROUND A FEW AREAS ONE BEING THE FEASIBILITY OF USING RECYCLED MATERIALS AND FOOD CONTACT PACKAGING- THE AVAILABLE. SUPPLY OF RIGHT RECYCLED RESIN THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE MARKET PLACE. TO MEET THE MANDATE PROPOSED IN THE BILL. CAN PROVIDE MANY FACTORS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE FLEXIBILITY. GIVEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS RECLAMATION CAPACITY AND U. S. FDA REQUIREMENTS FOR USING RECYCLED RATHER THAN IN FOOD PACKAGING. HI IT'S ARGUED THAT THE AVAILABLE LIVE RECYCLED RESIN THAT I'M LIKELY TO BE SUFFICIENT. TO ACHIEVE THE MANDATE OF PERCENTAGES. WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR AND HALF OF THOSE. FROM LANGUAGE YOUR GRASSY CONCERN. THOSE CHANGES WOULD PROVIDE MANUFACTURERS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE TIME ALLOW FOR POWER CYCLE YEAH HE RESPECTED CONTENT PERCENTAGES. FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY FEE OR BOTH BASED ON CERTAIN CRITERIA INCLUDING THE AVAILABLE TO BUY RECYCLED RESIN. AND REQUIRE POWER CYCLE THE BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH. SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS HOW MANY REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE. PENALTIES ARE BEING SPENT. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT TO WORK WITH THE. AUTHORS IN THE SPA.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I AM GAIL DEL HANA AND I REPRESENT WHAT YOUR GROWERS ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS GROW FRESH PRODUCE IN CALIFORNIA ARIZONA COLORADO AND NEW MEXICO. WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RECYCLING THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS WE USE THAT PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PRODUCE. HOWEVER WE HAVE THREE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. AND ARE POSING LESS AMENDED AT THE TIME. WE HAVE TO JERK BUT WE HAVE SHARED THESE CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR AND CO AUTHOR AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THEM JUST SUGGESTED AND THEN THAT. FIRST THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE DISCRETION FOR CAL RECYCLE TO EXTEND THE COMPLIANCE RATE GREAT. IF THE RECYCLED CONTENT IN THERMOFORM PACKAGING IS NOT AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES. AT REASONABLE PRICES. THE SUBJECTING FARMERS TO ENFORCEMENT YOUR NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. EVERY OTHER AGENCY HAS HAD AND STILL HAVE HOT BUTTON. ALLOW FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SECOND THE BILL EXEMPTS MANUFACTURERS FROM THE COURT RIGHT ACT THAT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT ONCE AN ENTITY IS FORMED AND GATHERS UP ALL THE THERMOFORM CLAM SHELLS WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THAT APPLIED THAT. WE ARE CONCERNED THE SUPPLY WILL GET SOLD OFF THE TEXT FILE. WHICH IN TURN DRIVES UP OUR SUPPLY. TODAY THE POST CONSUMER P. E. T. BOTTLES ARE UP THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. BUT THERE IS ALREADY A MAJOR DISRUPTION IN THE MARKET. THIRD THE BILLS EXEMPTION FOR THE FARMER IN THE FIELD DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE FARMERS WHO HARVEST THEIR CROP. TO THE COOLING FACILITY AND THEN PACKAGES IT FOR SHIPPING. THE BILL THREE FARMERS WITH THE MANUFACTURERS FOR SIMPLY USING THERMOFORMED CONTAINERS TO SELL THEIR PRODUCE. WHILE FRMERS ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF PURCHASING RECYCLED CONTAINERS THEY ARE IN THE FOOD GROWING BUSINESS NOT THE PLASTIC CONTAINER MANUFACTURING THE- WE ASK THAT YOU CALL THE COMMITTEE THROWING THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WE SHOULD TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT SEEING NONE ROOM ONE TWELVE SAYING NO WITNESSES IN ROOM ONE TWELVE LISTER THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD QUEUE UP THOSE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. FOUR SEVEN EIGHT. THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME.

THANK YOU KAREN MEMBER THIS IS LAUREN AGUILAR ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN IN THE PACKAGING AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FLEXIBLE PACKAGING ASSOCIATION ALSO AND IN A CALL TO LET THE MEDITATION. THANK YOU. NINE TWO NINETY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS CODY BAWLED ME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA STRAWBERRY COMMISSION WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHTY WELL LET'S COME BACK TO THE FLOOR- MEMBERS WHO WISH TO ASK QUESTIONS- CENTER WHITE HOUSE YES YEAH MISTER TURNER I'M LOOKING FOR CLARIFICATION ON THE DEFINITION. OF THE COMPACT COMMINGLING RATE THEORY RECENT AMENDMENTS AFTER OR BEFORE- AFTER HE Q. TALK ABOUT THE FORM OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL VERSUS THE TYPE OF THE TYPE IS THE RESIN IS THE IS THE SAME. AS THE ONE BUT WE'RE SEPARATING RATHER THAN WE'RE SEPARATING BOTH OF THEM AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT IF THE RESIN IS THE SAME AT AN END I GUESS THE REASON FOR. RT ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING I WAS ON THAT- MISTER- DAVID TO CANCER THAT. DAVID ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I AM I'M HERE YES- THE REASON WHY WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTAINER SEPARATED OUT BECAUSE WITH THE B. SEVEN NINETY THREE BOTTLES ARE REALLY GOING TO END UP BEING RECYCLED AND MR TO GO BACK INTO BOTTLES. AND GIVE THEM A FORMS ARE NOT SEGREGATED OUT- THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME SITUATION THAT WE'VE HAD UP TO THIS POINT WHICH IS WHERE THEY ARE NOT COLLECTED- AND MOST AMANDA BEING SENT TO LANDFILL WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLATFORM CONTAINERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING TO GO BACK INTO. NORMAL FORMS ARE ALSO SOME- PROPERTIES THERMAL FORMS- THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT THROUGH THE IVIES ARE LOWER THAN BOTTLES AND THEY REALLY ARE COMPATIBLE TO BE RECYCLED WITH BOTTLES EITHER MOST OF THE BOTTLE RECYCLERS WILL SPEAK AROUND THE STATE. THEY HAVE NO. THERMAL FORMS IN THE DALES WHATSOEVER. MISTER CHAIR BUT THAT WE GET INTO THAT'S THE TYPE BIKE I GET THAT THE PET ONE AND THE PET FOR A GUY I SEE THAT SEPARATION I'D LIKE. ALL MANUFACTURERS TO BE PEP ONE THE QUESTION IS THAT. 80% OF. THE BOTTLES THAT ARE RECYCLED NEVER GET TO CURBSIDE THEY GO DIRECTLY TO RECYCLING CENTER THERE CO MINGLED WITH OTHER PLASTICS SO THAT. YOU'RE ONLY DEALING WITH 12% OF THE WORLD AND- I KNOW A SENATOR THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE. OF THE RECYCLING TO RECYCLERS VERSUS CURBSIDE SO THAT WORLD WOULD SHRINK THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ABANDONED THEIR THEIR BOTTLES SO IT'S ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE PROBABLY SINGLE DIGITS. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT BUT IF WE FOCUS ON THE TYPE. IT WILL GET MORE BANG BANG OUT OF THAT BECAUSE- THEY'LL BE THE BOTTLES WILL BE GOING TO THE RECYCLERS AND THE OTHER PLASTICS. WE GET IN BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S JUST A LOOP ON THE- THE- THE- CLAM SHELLS RIDER IN THE INCOME COLLECTING THESE THINGS- IT'S A CONCERN. THAT THE IN THE BIG IN THE LONG RUN HI I DON'T WANT US TO CREATE A BUNCH OF WORK FOR PEOPLE. WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE NOT. IT IS MORE IMPORANT FOR US TO GET TO THE- THE MANUFACTURING OF THE- MATERIAL SO THAT IT'S IN TAP ONE AND IT'S ALL IN THAT IN THAT CLOSE LOOP- I URGE THE AUTHORS TO. TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A BUT- WE MAY BE SHIFTING SOME COSTS HERE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE AT THE- WASTE TREATMENT PLANT PLANTS- FOR A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF RECOVERY WHERE WE COULD TACKLE MINGLE RATE. IF IT'S IF I'M SEPARATING CONTAMINATION FROM MAYONNAISE FROM CONTAMINATION WITH. ONE IMPACT TWO AND THREE SO THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT BED I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THERE KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE SUBJECT JUST- LET SEVERAL ACCOUNTS KENO- THROUGH THE CHAIR THAT THE BEVERAGE BOTTLE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER SIMILAR ISSUES AND SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS IT. SPECIALLY WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEVEN NINETY THREE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ECONOMY FOR THE BEVERAGE BOTTLES AS WELL. PARTY THANK YOU SEVERAL CASKEY- SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED- IS THERE A MOTION. WELL LET'S LET'S DO THIS WE WE'VE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM ACTUALLY- LOOK USER IS OUR MOTION. SENATOR ALSO MOVES THE BILL. ALL RIGHT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SOMEONE MEMBER IRWIN OR TANG OKAY I JUST WANT TO SAY WE ARE CONTINUING TO AGAIN AS I MENTIONED WORK WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS- THE DEFINITION OF PRODUCER AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SWITCHING THAT TO- THE THERMOFORM ABOUT PURCHASER SO. THESE ARE WE WANT THIS BILL TO WORK AND WE WANT THIS TO BE FIXED REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS- THAT IS- TREND SETTING IN THE WORLD THIS IS OUR BILL LAST YEAR WAS SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE TO GET THIS RIGHT. THANK YOU. ANYTHING FURTHER NOTHING NOTHING FURTHER ALL RIGHT THEN SHE COUNSEL IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL THIS IS EIGHTY FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT BY FAMILY MEMBER TO HANG WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR DO TO US SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG HI.

THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE TO NO REGULATION DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY DOES NOT REFLECT THE CHANGING PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY WHICH IS MATED FORSMAN MORE DIFFICULT. THIS LACK OF REGULATION HAS LED TO INCREASED PREDATORY BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY.

HEARD IT DOES SETTLEMENT COMPANIES FOM ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING PRACTICES REQUIRE CRITIC CRITICAL DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL OPTIONS. AND LASTLY PROVIDE CONSUMERS INJURED BY BAD ACTORS WITH REMEDIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE GUARDRAILS OVER THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY BEFORE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE ALREADY OR ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE WORK I. D. F. P. I WILL PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH ROBUST PROTECTIONS THAT THEY URGENTLY NEED NOW.

EIGHTEEN SEVEN FIVE ONE THREE YEAR MORATORIUM ON BIOMETRICS IS NOT ENOUGH TO SEASIDE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY AND NEW WAYS TO REMOTELY REQUEST I DON'T RECORD OUTLINED IN THE BILL ARE BOTH UNNECESSARY AND- INEFFICIENT. FIRST BASE AROUND TECHNOLOGY OFTEN FAIL TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL CORRECTLY PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN I'VE MET ITSELF HAD THAT AND USING SUCH AN ERROR PRONE PROCEDURE WOULD ONLY DECREASE GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY OTHER BIOMETRICS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME PROBLEMS I FACE SURVEILLANCE WELL THE REMAINDER HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY PRODUCE BIASED RESULTS. COMPANIES LIKE CLEARVIEW A I SECRETLY BUILD FACE RECOGNITION DATABASE AND PROVIDE THEM TO BUSINESSES POLICE AND ICE CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT USE TAXPAYER MONEY TO BOLSTER THIS EXPLOITATIVE AND BUY IT WRITTEN WITH THEM EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE ONE WOULD REPRESENT THE FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE THINGS IN THE USE OF THIS ECLIPSE BY ERROR PRONE AND RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY.

WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL FACIAL RECOGNITION AND OTHER BIOMETRIC FROM THE BILL BUT DO NOT AGREE THAT APPROVAL SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC AT THE END OF THE THREE YEARS. EIGHTY SEVEN FIVE ONE REPRESENTS A MASSIVE EXPANSION OF GOVERNMENT USE THE BIOMETRIC THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN THE FACE OF THE MEXICAN OPPOSITION TO GOVERNMENT YOU WITH BANDS AND SEVERAL CITIES ALREADY I'M A TOTAL ABSENCE OF GUARDRAIL AND INFLATION ITSELF. IF THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER ERROR PRONE SOFTWARE IT'S UNLIKELY TO HAVE THE EFFECT WOULD BE N. I FE AUTHENTICATION PROCESS GUIDELINES CITED IN THE BILL. NOTHING THAT THEY CAN CONCERN ABOUT EXASPERATING AND I GUESS THE REST WITH THE USE OF BIOMETRIC EQUIPMENT ALONG RACE AND GENDER LINE. PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN LASTLY THE DANGER THE WIDESPREAD USE OF BIOMETRIC BY GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED NO MY TELEPHONE A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AVAILED THEMSELVES OF THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY.

SOFTWARE OFF THE WILL LIE LEAD TO YOU. BY OTHER TO. INCLUDING ONE. WITH OR WITHOUT OTHER THEY- EIGHTY SEVEN ONE IF DIALING ON COLLATERAL YOU BUT EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT VIOLENCE WILL NOT PREVENT BUT YOU. IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THAT END BALANCE IN MOTION WITHOUT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE SPECIFIC BIOMETRIC TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING AUTHORIZED.

THANK YOU WITH THE LOCAL I. NUMBER THREE TWENTY FIVE. HELLO THIS IS ANASTASI OF ANNAPOLIS MEMBER OF RACE AND EQUITY AND ALL PLANNING AND SAN FRANCISCO TENANTS UNION OPPOSED THE THREE TWENTY FIVE I MEAN YOU THINK THAT WAS MY LINE NUMBER. FIVE THREE TWO FIVE. THANK YOU WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER TWO EIGHTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. DANIEL GUTIERREZ ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU LINE NUMBER THREE THIRTY SEVEN. I DON'T THINK SO I THINK IT'S- YES THIS IS ME. TAKING THE NAME HERE- CONSTRUCTION- CENTER SKINNER I WANT TO- MY OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN FIVE ONE. CHRISTIAN AND GREEN WHICH IS AN ISSUE THAT. A HE- SEVEN FIVE ONE I'M SORRY I CAN'T AND I'M GREAT I'M JUST TOO OLD. HELLO. THANK YOU NECKS NEXT RECORD. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE IN CUBA SHELTER OKAY WE SEEN WAS CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING BRING IT BACK TO- MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS- A SEVEN MEMBER- WHEN I WILL- ASK IT IT DID THE BILL REMOVES SUNSET DATE THAT WAS SET IN A. B. AT TWENTY SIX THIRTY SIX AND AS WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THERE IS A CONCERN OF. THE AFTER THE MORATORIUM BIOMETRICS AND FACIAL RECOGNITION- TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS IN. DEVELOPED BEING USED IN. A BODY HURT THE YEAR WITH THE OPPOSITION- THE. WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ON THAT EFFORT VERSUS CONTINUING- EXTENDING THE SUNSET AND HAVING THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED. OKAY SO THE PERSISTENT THIS REMOVES THE SUNSET TO ALLOW COUNTY RECORDERS TO CONTINUE TO. GIVE VITAL RECORDS OF REMOTELY SO THAT'S THE ONE SENSE SUNSET WE ALIGNED IT BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY SOME OF THE PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS WE DID SAY WE WOULD DO A THREE YEAR MORATORIUM ON ISSUES LIKE USING BIOMETRICS OR FACIAL RECOGNITION VALVE MAKE REALLY CLEAR. THE MAIN THING WE WANT IS TO FOLLOW NEW STANDARDS AND WHEN ONE OF THE CALLERS SAID WE SANCTIONED THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION WHICH IN THIS STANDARD SAY IS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE NO STANDARDS ARE THE GOLD STANDARD AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS PROTECT OUR VERY MOST PRIVATE INFORMATION SO. COUNTY RECORDERS DO NOT USE FACIAL RECOGNITION OR BIOMETRICS REMOTELY THEY USE- THEY VERIFY IDENTITIES THROUGH KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IF THESE- TECHNOLOGY. SHOW PROMISE IT WOULD BE A WAY TO GUARANTEE YOUR PRIVACY SO THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS NOT ABLE TO GET YOUR RECORDS SO WE WANTED TO LEAVE THAT OPEN AND SEE HOW THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED. JUST AS MR FIT MR TING'S BILL- DID ALSO AND IT IS ALSO A LITTLE DISINGENUOUS TO SAY GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALREADY USING OF A BIOMETRIC DATA BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A NOTARIZATION OF YOUR YOU KNOW A MORTGAGE OR TITLE. YOU ARE USING BIOMETRICS THOSE ARE FINGERPRINTS SO AGAIN COUNTY RECORDERS HAVE NO EXPECTATION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE THIS BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS START TO BE HACKED WELL THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEVELOP. A WHOLE SYSTEM AT A BANK OF- PERHAPS SOME PRINTS AND COMPARE TO THEM NONE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE CURRENTLY BUT BECAUSE I AM THE- EURO I I'M VERY INVOLVED WITH- CYBER SECURITY I KNOW THAT THE MOST CRUCIAL THING IS KEEPING YOUR PRIVATE INFORMATION PRIVATE WHICH IS. WHY I FIND THE ARGUMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION SO DISINGENUOUS. OKAY I MEAN BECAUSE THESE ARE SOME GROUPS THAT WE- RELY ON TO PROVIDE US WITH YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DEVELOPING OUR- THEORIES ON- THE WHAT IS A DATA SECURITY WHAT IS A PRIVACY BREACH AND TRY AGAIN THEY'VE- THEY'VE RAISED THE POINT THAT THIS IS THE FIRST. STATUTE THAT EXPLICITLY WILL ALLOW FOR- THE USE OF FACIAL SERVING OTHERS THREE YEARS CENTERS NO THERE IS NO LANGUAGE ON THAT ALL THE LANGUAGE SAYS IS THAT WE ARE ABIDING BY THE HIGHEST SECURITY STANDARDS WHICH IS NO STANDARDS AND THEN. SPECIFICALLY THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE- THIS IS A VERY VERY LONG GUIDE MENTIONS OF BIOMETRIC DATA OR FACIAL RECOGNITION THAT THE COUNTY RECORDER'S WOULD BE USING IT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT USING IT. IT'S JUST LISTED IN THE NEST STANDARDS. OKAY. SENATORS OFFICES HERE MAX THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND- I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I KNOW YOU DO A LOT OF WORK IN THIS SPACE- AS I HAVE IN THE PAST AS WELL AND SO I WANT I KNOW YOU'VE DONE YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND ENSURING THAT- NO OTHER MUNICIPAL AGENCY OR THIRD PARTY OR STATE AGENCY- FOR ANY PURPOSES SHALL DISTRIBUTE OR SHARE THIS INFORMATION WHICH I THINK IS ALREADY- REALLY A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD HERE- IN ADDITION TO THE NEST ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION- GUIDELINES OFFER THE MULTI LAYERED- IDENTITY PROOFING WHICH I THINK IS WONDERFUL. NOW I'M JUST BUILDING OFF OF WHAT SENATOR- WE'LL GET WITH THE CHAIR HAD MENTIONED ABOUT THE BIOMETRICS BECAUSE I DO SHARE THAT CONCERN AS WELL BIOMETRICS IN ADDITION TO FINGERPRINTS COULD BE YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW I YOUR IRIS- YOUR FACE OF COURSE RECOGNITION WHICH I KNOW IS IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF HEAT BACK HOME AND IN MY DISTRICT SO CAN YOU. CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WHAT TYPES OF BIOMETRICS COULD BE USED AFTER- IF THIS SHOULD BE IN A MOVE AFTER THREE YEARS I MEAN I IT WOULD BE AGAIN THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR REPORTERS TO USE THEY DON'T HAVE THE VENDOR THAT USES IT THEY ARE NOT PLANNING ON USING IT IT'S JUST MENTIONED IN THIS BUT IF YOU WANT AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOUR YOUR- BIOMETRICS PROTECT YOUR DATA YOUR IPHONE READS YOUR FACE AND- THAT THAT IS A ONE WAY THAT- IT IS MUCH SAFER THAN- USING YOUR PASSPORT A PASSWORD TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY HAS ACCESS TO YOUR PHONE. BUT AGAIN THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGICAL WAY THAT REPORTERS WOULD DO THIS THEY WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE A DATABASE THEY WOULD HAVE TO COLLECT FOR THE DATABASE AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPARE TO THE DATABASE THE ONLY PLACE THAT I HAVE REALLY SEEN THIS HAPPENED IS AT THE AIRPORT. WITH CLEAR SO THE REASON THE WEIGHT CLEAR WORKS THAT- YOU. YOU WOULD. WILLINGLY PUT YOUR FACE INTO A DATABASE AND YOU ARE COMPARED EVERY TIME YOU GO TO THE THREE SECURITY TO THAT DATABASE. BUT THERE IS NO INTENTION HERE OF DOING THAT AT ALL. WE ONLY TOOK THE AMENDMENT BECAUSE OF THE PRIVACY GROUPS THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT IN THE NEXT STANDARDS WHICH ARE AGAIN THE STANDARDS USED BY. STATES AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND DRIVE YOU KNOW YOU COME FROM A TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND. THE HIGHEST LEVEL STANDARDS AND THEY THAT THOSE STANDARDS GO THROUGH- EVERY POSSIBLE THING THAT HAS TO DO WITH CYBER SECURITY SO. THEY MENTION FACIAL RECOGNITION AND AGAIN IN THERE THEY SAID THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH IDENTIFYING PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEY DON'T RECOMMEND USING IT BUT THEY DO CONTINUALLY UPDATE THAT- THOSE STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THE VERY HIGHEST LEVEL. YEAH AND I HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH I WILL- PROBABLY LAY OFF OF THE BILL TODAY JUST CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS RELATED AND ALTHOUGH IT'S JUST AN ESTIMATE. YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE RECORDERS WILL BE UTILIZING THAT. IN THE IMMEDIATE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD. ANSWER THAT- WHERE I SORT OF HAVE THE ISSUE THERE BUT I WOULD LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU MORE ABOUT THAT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. CENTRE COVER YEAH YOUR RECORD HIGHS WILL DEVELOP. SEEING NO OTHER MIKES UP THERE IS A MOTION BY CENTRE COVER EURO- THIS SET A SIMILAR IRVINE AS I JUST SAID YOU'RE UNDERSTAND. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT BUT- IT'S M. S. I HAVE SENT MY CONCERNS ALSO SO YOU MAY CLOSE. YEAH I JUST- I WANT TO REITERATE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTY RECORDERS ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONVENIENCE TO AND SAFE ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS TO- CERTIFIED VITAL RECORDS SO WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.

THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH IF I'M FULL TIME THE WIDE DIRECTOR OF CRISIS SERVICE THAT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN SOME AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO DATE THAT HELP CLARIFY THE POSITION APPLIED ACROSS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INSURANCE NOT AT THE COURT MEETING WELL. THE DIVISION CONTINUES TO BE OVERLY BROAD AND DUPLICATE ABOUT. NAPPER EIGHT THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE IN ADDITION TO OTHER REQUIREMENTS REQUIRES THE CONVENING MEETING LOCAL LEADERS TO DEVELOP A STATEWIDE BAN HERE HOUSE CREDIT CARE DELIVERY PROFOUND INCLUDING THE YOUR YOUR LIFE IN THE NTIONAL GUIDELINES FOR QUITE THE CARE PUBLISHED BY THE FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. WHICH DATA LOCAL LEADERS WOULD IMPLEMENT THIS PROVISION CREATES CHALLENGES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT ON ONLY CREATE THE MANDATE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT ALSO APPLIED THE GUIDELINE WHICH IS NOT READILY APPLICABLE ARE PRACTICAL FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS RURAL AREAS COMPOUNDING. AS AN EXAMPLE THE GUIDELINES PROPOSED REGIONAL TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CALL CENTER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AVAILABILITY- PRACTICE MOBILE RESPONSIVE ANYWHERE ANYONE ANYWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY IN CRISIS STABILIZATION FACILITIES AVAILABLE IN HOME MIKE NON HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. WHILE ADMIRABLE TO STRIVE TO ACHIEVE IT IT'S NOT PRACTICAL AND SMALL AND RURAL COUNTIES WHERE THE NUMBER UP QUITE. LOUD THEIR LONG DISTANCES TO TRAVEL AND IN SOME CASES EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT OPERATE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN.

CHECK THAT LET'S GO TO ITEM NUMBER TWO S. A. R. NUMBER SEVEN BY SENATOR BRADFORD-ON DR MARTIN LUTHER KING MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR AN FBI SURVEILLANCE TAPES CENTRE BRADFORD YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. AND YOUR RESOLUTION THANK YOU MISS SHEERAN'S CINEMA. AGARRAR CURRY FOR A LOAN ME TO. JUMP IN HERE REAL QUICK MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT- THAT'S J. R. SEVEN AS CHAIR OF A LEGISLATIVE BLACK-CAUCUS I THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL. THE ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO- WRITING THAT A TERRIBLE WRONG THOUGH. IN THIS NATION AND THIS MEASURE CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF A MORAL RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS OF THE REVEREND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. DR MELISSA KING JUNIOR LED THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. AND FROM HIS ELECTION AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE MONTGOMERY IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE UNTIL IT SAYS THE NATION FIFTY THREE YEARS AGO WHILE STANDING. ON THE BALCONY OF HIS ROOM AT THE LORRAINE MOTEL. DR KING WAS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE TODAY DR KING IS ONE OF THE MOST REVERED LEADERS THIS COUNTRY AND THIS WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. THIS GREAT MAN'S LEGACY CHALLENGE THE MORAL COMPASS OF THIS NATION CREATING A SURGE OF GENES RELATED TO EQUITY EQUALITY AND JUSTICE. DR KING BELIEVED IN THE WORDS OF HIS LIFE TO ENSURE. THAT THE FULL PROMISES OF THIS COUNTRY WILL REALIZE FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS REGARDLESS OF RACE COLOR OR CREED. THE FBI BEGAN MONITORING DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE DURING HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT SUPPOSEDLY BUT WRONG FEE SOUL BECAUSE OF CONNECTIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY. FBI DIRECTOR J. EDGAR HOOVER WAS AGGRESSIVELY HOSTILE AND OBSESSED TOWARDS DR. KING ORDERED HIS AGENTS TO ENGAGE IN COVERT OPERATIONS AGAINST HIM. OPERATIONS LIKE THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED TO INVESTIGATE BLACK NATIONALIST HATE GROUPS TARGETED. AUTHORS THE N. DOUBLE ACP AND OTHERS STILL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS LEADERS JUST TO NAME A FEW. UNDER THE FBI'S DOMESTIC COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM DR KING HIS FAMILY AND ASSOCIATES WERE SUBJECTED TO VARIOUS KINDS OF FBI SURVEILLANCE THE FBI EVEN SENT DR KING A NOTE URGING HIM TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN ORDER TO AVOID HUMILIATION OF THE RELEASE OF THESE PUBLIC. ILLEGALLY GATHERED TAKES AND RECORDINGS AND TRANSCRIPTS. THAT THE FBI HAD- RECORDED IN SECURE ACCORDING TO A US SENATE COMMITTEE CONVENED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES TO INVESTIGATE THE FBI DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS THE COMMITTEE TO TERMING THE FOLLOWING. RATHER THAN TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE LEADS COMMUNISTS TO IT BELIEVES WERE ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE DR KING THE GENERAL INSTEAD ADOPTED A CURIOUS TACTIC OF TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE SUPPOSED TARGET OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S INTERESTS. BEING DR KING HIMSELF THESE RECORDINGS ARE SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED BY THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVEN. WHAT THE FBI DID TO DR KING AND OTHERS WAS UNLAWFUL VAN AND IT'S A LAWFUL TODAY IT WAS IN A LOSS OF LAWFUL INVASION OF PRIVACY. FURTHERMORE THIS WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL SEARCH UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THE FBI LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL POLICE FORCES HAVE USED THESE SURVEILLANCE TACTICS TO TARGET BLACK PEOPLE AND OTHERS FIGHTING FOR RACIAL JUSTICE FOR DECADES THEY EVEN USE IT TODAY. AND YET WE CAN SEE THE STATUS BEING CONTINUED. TO BE USED TO TARGET BLACK ACTIVISTS IN ORDER ORGANIZATIONS AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR AFTER THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD. FOR EXAMPLE BLACK ACTIVISTS IN SAN FRANCISCO HAD TO SUE THE CITY AND THE COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF UNLAWFUL SURVEILLANCE TACTICS. THIS IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT ONLY CALLS FOR THESE UNLAWFUL TAPES TO BE DESTROYED IT ALSO CALLS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ROUTE PREVENT. SIMILAR ABUSES THIS RESOLUTE RESOLUTION FOCUSES ATTENTION ON THE FAILURE IN OUR HISTORY THAT MUST BE CORRECTED. LEAST WE IGNORE- ISIS UNLESS WE HAVE A NOR IT AND CONTINUE TO PREPARE PREPARED TO WAIT THE SAME INJUSTICE AGAINST OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS I THINK MEMBERS HISTORY SPOKEN FOR ITSELF AND THESE TAPES NEED TO BE RE SPORTS STORY I MEAN DESTROYED I'M SORRY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. AND NINE CENTER SO IT'S CLEAR MY MIND YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING THE- AMENDMENTS IS OUTLINED IN THE STAFF REPORT. YES WE ARE OKAY EXCELLENT SO LET'S MOVE TO GERMANY AT. THE NET TODAY WHO IS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT. MR THAT TAKE THANK YOU CHAIR AMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HAWAII STATE CONFERENCE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE THE END OF LEASE E. P. I AM HERE TO SHORE STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. J. R. SEVEN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE WAS AND STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOSTINFLUENTIAL CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. DR KING'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE N. DOUBLE ACP DATES BACK TO HIS POSITION ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP MONTGOMERY BRANCH IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THROUGH HIS LEADERSHIP AND THE VARIOUS BOYCOTTS MARCHES AND RALLIES OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BUT THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON AND UP UNTIL HIS ASSASSINATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. LIKE DR KING AND SEVERAL NOTABLE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST AT THE TIME THE FBI INVESTIGATED THE N. DOUBLE ACP FOR SUPPOSED CONNECTIONS WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE INVESTIGATIVE TACTICS USED RANGED FROM PLANTING INFORMANTS AND BUGGING HOTELS IN HOUSE PHONES AMONGST OTHER THINGS BUT NO ONE DEALT WITH THE BURDEN OF THE INTENSE UNWARRANTED SURVEILLANCE. MORE THAN DR KING. THE FBI DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO INFRINGE UPON DR KING'S RIGHT UNDER THE PRETENSE OF PROTECTING THIS COUNTRY FROM COMMUNIST FROM COMMUNISM. THE FBI SURVEILLANCE RECORDINGS OF DR KING. WE MADE WITH THE INTENTION TO DISCREDIT HIS LEADERSHIP IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AS A WHOLE. DR KING LIVED THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE WITHOUT ANY SEMBLANCE OF PRIVACY WHILE CARRYING THE TREMENDOUS BURDEN OF BEING A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA. LET US NOT BE ABLE FOR BOTH FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS TO DEFAME THE CHARACTER OF DR KING AND INSTEAD EMBRACES LEGACY AND RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO THE FIGHT FOR EQUITY AND JUSTICE. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HAWAII AND W. C. P.

MESSENGER OKAY SO LET'S CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING ON A PETITION IN SUPPORT ARE THE MEMBERS HAVING QUESTIONS CENTER BORDERS. YOU RECOGNIZE. THE RESEARCH RESEARCHER ALEX SEGMENT- ME RECORDS POSE A QUESTION FOR YOU TOO THE AUTHOR IF HE'D BE WILLING TO ACCEPT VERY GOOD- DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN THAT THESE MATERIALS ARE OF SUCH HISTORIC IN ACADEMIC VALUE THAT TO DESTROY THEM WOULD BE- SIGNIFICANT LOSS. TO THE BACKGROUND FROM THAT ERA ESPECIALLY AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH- THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES RIGHT NOW AND WILL CONTINUE FOR SOME TIME THAT THESE THINGS OFFER SIGNIFICANT VALUE. AS MANY THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE CENTER ROGER PLEASE- WHAT HISTORICAL VALUE OR CULTURAL VALUE DOES IT HAVE TO LEGALLY LARGECAP SOMEONE BE IT IN THE PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN HOME INTO THEIR OWN PRIVACY OF THEIR OWN OFFICE. OR IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM I SEE ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE TO. CULTURE TO SOCIETY TO THIS NATION OR TO THE WORLD FOR ILLEGALLY GAINED WIRETAPS OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN WELL I THINK YOU JUST ANSWERED THAT. MAYBE IN YOUR EARLIER STATEMENTS THAT THIS IS OF SERVICE SUCH SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE WITH THE OVER REACH OF LA ENFORCEMENT. THAT THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW THINGS SHOULD NOT BE DONE. AND WITH THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN ACADEMIC VALUE DOES IT NOT. THE STORY OF THE LEGAL WIRETAPPING ITSELF DOES THE CONTENT OF THE WIRE TAP NO THERE IS NO VALUE AND WHATEVER. OFFHAND THE CONVERSATIONS DR KING MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH ASSOCIATES FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT BRINGS NO VALUE WHATSOEVER THE FACT THAT IT WAS LEGALLY DONE I THINK IT'S A LESSON TO BE LEARNED HERE WILL HOLD THIS GOVERNMENT HAS INTRUDED ESPECIALLY ON PEOPLE OF COLOR. CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS FOR NUMBER OF YEARS A DOCTOR KING WAS ALIVE. IN IT F ITSELF THAT STORY NEEDS TO BE TWELVE BUT WHAT WAS RECORDED THAT WAS CAPTURED ILLEGALLY NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE THAT WANT THEIR HOME OR THEIR OFFICES ILLEGALLY WIRETAPPING HOPE THAT. FIFTY YEARS LATER IT WOULD BE. THOUGHT TO BE EDUCATIONAL IN ANY SENSE OF THE MAGIC NEXT. THANK YOU HI- I PERSONALLY THINK THAT MANY OF THE POINTS THAT MINE THAT MY-COLLEAGUE HAS HAS MADE. ARE MERITORIOUS. EVEN IF WE DON'T LIKE HOWEVER ON HOW THINGS WERE- OBTAINED IN THIS CASE PATENTLY ILLEGAL. THAT- OUR SCHOLARS- WILL DRAW UPON THESE IN THE YEARS AHEAD IN TO. REMOVE FROM THE ARCHIVE. ACCESS TO THOSE I KIND OF. THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND I RESPECT WHAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY TRYING TO DO- IF- IF. THE SHOE WERE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND- FOLKS WERE TRYING TO GET THE BRITISH ARCHIVES TO DESTROY THE RECORDS OF GANDHI I THINK THERE MIGHT BE AN ISSUE- THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM. AND I DON'T LIKE WHAT HAPPENED I THINK IT'S WRONG IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT WAS ILLEGAL. BUT THERE IS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE- THAT I THINK WE COULD BE LOSING- IF WE- TOSS IT OUT. JULIE NOTED OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION. THING IN CENTER PRESS FOR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU THIS YEAR- IN DR KING'S CLOSING REMARKS AT THE END OF WAYS TO BE EMANCIPATION DAY RALLY IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN DR KING ELOQUENTLY STATED THERE'S NOTHING GREATER IN THE WORLD THAN FREEDOM. IT'S WORTH GOING TO JAIL FOR IT'S WORTH LOSING A JOB FOR IT'S WORTH DYING FOR. AND UNFORTUNATELY DR KING DIED FOR THAT FREEDOM UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO EXPERIENCE THE FREEDOM THAT HE HAD HOPED FOR AND THAT HE HAD FOUGHT FORCE SO VIOLENTLY THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. FOR THE LAST FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OF HIS LIFE FROM NOVEMBER NINETEEN SIXTY THREE UNTIL HIS DEATH IN APRIL NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT DR KING LIVE WITHOUT ANY SEMBLANCE OF PRIVACY. OR FREEDOM. THIS RESOLUTION IS JUST A FIRST STEP TOWARD RIGHTING THE WRONGS DR KING AND MANY BLACK PEOPLE THAT HAVE AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DO THIS ILLEGAL SURVEILLANCE AN INVASION OF PRIVACY BY THE FBI. LET US URGE OUR NATIONAL ARCHIVES TO FINALLY GRANT DR KING THE PEACE AND PRIVACY THAT EVERY CITIZEN IS DESERVED BUT THAT A BAITED HIM FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THESE ILLEGAL TAPES THEY PROVIDE NO CULTURAL NO EDUCATION OR NO NATIONAL BENEFIT WHATSOEVER. WE OWE IT TO THIS GREAT MAN WE OWE IT TO HIS LEGACY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WE OWE IT TO HIS FAMILY WE OWE IT TO THIS NATION TO DESTROY THE TAPES I RESPECT WHAT I THRIVE OFF.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS OF BURNING A ROSTER WITH CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB ELEVEN HUNDRED. THE U. S. HOMELAND SECURITY HAS DESIGNATED SIXTEEN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS SECTORS THAT ARE VITAL AND CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMY AND PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE COUNTRY- COMMUNICATIONS IS ONE OF THOSE AND FOR THAT REASON INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES ARE CONSIDERED. CONFIDENTIAL WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH STATE AGENCIES ABOUT OUR RESTORATION EFFORTS AND OUTAGES WHEN THEY OCCUR IN FACT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A NEW LAW THAT REQUIRES US WITHIN AN HOUR OF DISCOVERY MANAGES TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH TELL- YES WHICH WE DO IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT WAS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE- WHEN DID WE RESTORE IT SO THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND IS PROVIDED TO CALLAWAY S. WHICH IS THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCY. SO WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS WE HAVE HERE IS THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GOING TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AN MAKE IT PUBLIC MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. WHICH IS OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE TIMING IS BETTER DISCLOSURE OF THAT INFORMATION. CURRENT LAW TODAY ALREADY REQUIRES THAT WHEN COMMUNICATION NETWORKS ARE DESTROYED AND THAT THEIR WRIST D. OR RESTORE TO EQUAL OR BETTER QUALITY. IF ANYONE IS C. W. A. HAS FOUND A SITUATION. WHERE A COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER HAS FAILED TO RESTORE TO EQUAL OR BETTER IT IS THEIR OBLIGATION TO REPORT THAT. YEAH WE'VE GOT US IN THE PAST TO NAME AT LEAST ONE COMMUNITY WHERE THIS HAS OCCURRED. AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.

EIGHTY SIX NINETY FIVE WILL PROTECT ELDER AND DEPENDENT ADULT IN CALIFORNIA FROM ABUSE NEGLECT AND EXPLOITATION BY EXPANDING AND ENHANCING THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. BUT TWENTY THIRTY ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE THE NUMBER OF ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH DISABILITIES WILL GROW FROM ONE MILLION IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO THREE MILLION IN TWENTY SIXTY. CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION IS ALSO INCREASINGLY SUFFERING HOMELESSNESS ACCORDING TO UCSF RESEARCHERS HALF OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. WITH HALF OF THOSE BECOMING HOMELESS AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY. ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO FULL INCLUSION AND EQUITY FOR ALL AGES IS ELDER ABUSE WITH ITS ESTIMATED IMPACT LIVE AT HOME TOTALING IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOSSES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS THIS TWO PRONGED ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AND ELDER ABUSE EFFECTIVELY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTO THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. TO FILL SUCH A NEED EIGHTY SIX NINETY FIVE WOULD EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE APS SYSTEM FOR OLDER INDEPENDENT OF DOLLS. BY LOWERING THE AGE OF ELIGIBILITY FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY TO SERVE HIGHLY VULNERABLE ADULTS.

QUITE A BOMB THERE ARE SOME NUMBER TWO I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS IN THE FUTURE. I WILL REMEMBER THIS TO MY DYING DAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT- SO AB ELEVEN. EIGHTY FOUR PHYLUM NUMBER THIRTEEN. OF THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU SENATORS APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR TO ENSURE. PATIENT PRIVACY. LET ME START BY FIRST THANKING THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND ACCEPT ALL OF THE MOMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. INCLUDING SEVERAL AGREED TO IN SENATE HEALTH. THAT WOULD CLARIFY THAT A CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION REQUEST APPLIES TO ALL SERVICES. REMOVED EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS FROM THE LIST OF DOCUMENTS IN WHICH HEALTH PLANS MUST NOTIFY. PATIENTS ABOUT THE CCR PROCESS AND CLEAN UP DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION PROVISIONS. SENATORS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER FOR THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. SUCH AS THOSE RUN THEIR PARTNER'S HEALTH PLAN FOR YOUNG ADULTS COVERED ON THEIR PARENT'S PLAN BEFORE THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. UNDER THE ACA. IN SOME INSTANCES THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION. ABOUT CARE PROVIDED THAT THE PATIENT DOES NOT WANT REVEALED TO THAT PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER. IN SOME CASES IT WOULD BE EVEN DANGEROUS FOR A PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER TO RECEIVE INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT SERVICES THE PATIENT HAS RECEIVED. FOR EXAMPLE. A WOMAN WHO'S ACCESSING REPRODUCTIVE CARE OR CARE RELATED TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MAY NOT WANT HER PARTNER TO KNOW SHE'S ACCESSING THAT CARE. A TRANSGENDER YOUTH MAY NOT WANT THEIR PARENTS TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THIS BILL UPDATES EXISTING PATIENT PRIVACY LAWS TO DO SEVERAL THINGS FIRST. IT AUTOMATICALLY ENSURES A COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY REGARDING SENSITIVE SERVICES AS DEFINED ARE CONFIDENTIAL. AND NOT SENT TO THE PRIMARY POLICY HOLDER. SO IT. EXISTING DEFINITION OF SENSITIVE SERVICES TO INCLUDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. EXTENDING AUTOMATIC CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THOSE SERVICES AND THIRD. IT ENSURES THAT PATIENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING SENSITIVE SERVICES HAVE A PATHWAY TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR SINCE WE'VE HEARD SOME RECENT OPPOSITION SUGGEST OTHERWISE THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE EXISTING MEDICAL CONSENT LAW NOR DOES IT CHANGE THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR ANY SERVICE. ALL IT DOES IS ENSURE THAT FOLKS WHO NEED CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS CAN RECEIVE IT. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES- MOLLY ROBSON FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND CHRISTINE SMITH FROM THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BACK TO CHURCH ALREADY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TWO- MISS ROBSON OR MISS SMITH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND WAS KIND OF FUNNY TO CALIFORNIA. WE REPRESENT THE SEVEN.

THE END OF THE ONE THIRTY EIGHT PATIENTS CONTINUE TO FIND IT DIFFICULT ACTION SIDE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. TO GAIN CONFIDENTIALITY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S HEALTH CENTRES CONFIDENTIALITY IS AT THE CORE. OF ITS ROLE AS A TRUSTED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. WHEN PATIENTS SEEK. THEY MAY NOT RE. THAT ABOUT THE THEY RECEIVE MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE BY REACHING OUT AND SAYS OUT AND- THIS IS. TRUE FOR MINORS AND YOUNG ADULTS FROM THEIR PARENTS. ANYONE HAVE NAVIGATE COVERAGE ISSUES WITH THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE KNOWS THAT IT'S NOT A SIMPLE OR EASY PROCESS. EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL SHIFT THE DEFAULT POSITION TO THE ONE WHERE THE HEALTH PLAN AUTOMATICALLY DIRECT COMMUNICATION TO THE PATIENT. RATHER THAN HAVE THE PRIMARY SUBSCRIBER OF THE PLAN YOU SHOULD RECEIVING CERTAIN TYPES OF SERVICE AT. PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIALITY IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO ACCESS NEEDED SERVICES WITHOUT YOUR JUDGMENT FOR THEIR DECISION. ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WILL ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND THEIR INFORMATION OUR KATHY. PRETTY GREEN AND THANK HER NONE OF THE PRODUCTS ON THREE ELEVEN EIGHTY FOUR AND. WHATEVER JUST PART OF THE- THANK YOU.

UNFORTUNATELY AT THE START OF THIS PROCESS WE DID NOT FULLY APPRECIATE HOW BROAD THE INTERNET THE BILL WISE AND HAVE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON PRIVACY ISSUES RELATED TO SENSITIVE SERVICES AND THE NEED AND DESIRE TO UPDATE THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. TO ENSURE OUR MOST VULNERABLE PATIENTS AND SERVICES RECEIVED THE FULL PROTECTIONS INTENDED BY THE ORIGINATING LEGISLATION. AS SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER AT ONE THIRTY EIGHT WAS IT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED UNDERSTANDING THE CRITICAL BALANCE OF ENSURING PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. ALSO PUSHING THAT MINISTRY TO BURDEN THAT WOULD BE PLACED ON PLANT MANAGER. AT LIMITING THE TYPE OF ACCOMMODATION IS NOT IT IS NOT EASY AS IT WOULD SEEM ONLY REQUIRED INITIAL WORK AROUND BY THE PLANS BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO TRACK EACH REQUEST TO ENSURE THAT THE COMBINATION THING APPROPRIATE MAKE KNOWLEDGE AND HONORED BY ALL VENDORS.

THERE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE STANDING AT THE PODIUM WHY WOULD I RECOGNIZE YOU DO SO ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM- EIGHTY SEVEN TO ONE. THANK YOU MR CHAIR EIGHTY SEVEN TO ONE WILL INVALIDATE DENSITY RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVATE COVENANTS THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH LOCAL ZONING. UNTIL THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WERE USED AS A TOOL TO SEGREGATE AND RED LINE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS- DECISIONS AND THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAVE MADE THESE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE HOWEVER. THESE COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER VESTIGES OF DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS LIMITS ON THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNITS THAT CAN BE BUILT. THE DENSITY LIMITS ALSO CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING CODES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THEIR DISCRIMINATORY ORIGIN IN CLEAR CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING DENSITY RESTRICTIONS ON HOUSING COVENANTS REMAIN ENFORCEABLE AGAINST AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. AT SEVENTY ONE WILL PROVIDE A PROCESS TO REMOVE RESTRICTIVE HOUSING COVENANTS AND ENSURE THAT WE BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING LOCAL CONTROL. THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT DENSITY RESTRICTIONS IN PRIVATE COVENANTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. UNDER AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO NO LONGER RESIDE ON THE PROPERTY CANNOT USE COVENANTS TO CURTAIL MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WITH ME TESTIFIED SUPPORTER BRANDON PAYETTE WITH PUBLIC COUNSEL AND HAY SEUSS HERNANDEZ WITH THE COMMUNITY CORPORATION OF SANTA MONICA ARE YOU MR PAYETTE. OR MR NANDO'S ARE YOU AVAILABLE. ELEVEN SENATORS- MY NAME IS BRANDON HEY I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH ACCOUNT OPEN NATION'S LARGEST PRO BONO EARNED. YOUR TRUST AND SUPPORT OF EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE- EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE CENTRIST DEMOCRAT POSITION OF PROPERTY OWNERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT MUCH AUDIBLE HELPING ON THEIR PROPERTY AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WILL COMMIT. AND RAISE THE DEVELOPERS FROM OUR PAST SHOULD HAVE NO SAY IN THE DECISION. MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE RACIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE OF COLOR. UNFORTUNATELY RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT ON A GIVEN PARTIAL TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF. ARE STILL TREATED AS ENFORCEABLE THAT EVEN IF THOSE PRIVATE DENSELY RESTRICTION CONFLICT WITH THE APPLICABLES RUNNING CODE AND ARE CONTAINED IN THE SAME DOCUMENT AS EXPLICITLY RACIST RESTRICTION. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE ADDRESSES THIS PROBLEM BY IMPLEMENTING A SIMPLE PROCESS REPORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO REMOVE PRIVATE DEATH THE DESTRUCTION. WITHOUT THIS PROCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WILL BE FORCED TO CONTINUE WALKING AWAY. FROM OTHERWISE IDEAL PROJECT BACK. THE BILL WOULD NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES THE LOCAL DINING CULTURE LAND USE RULES AND THE CAREFULLY CRAFTED MR IMPORTANT CONSERVATION MEASURES MEASURES. THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT I MEAN IF. WE HAVE A PUBLC COUNSEL ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR- SEVEN TWENTY ONE TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS. OF HIRING CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATORY.

IN HOPES THEY CAN BE FIX THE ISSUES RAISED BY EIGHTY SEVEN TO ONE PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THEY PERPETRATE THE POLITICAL INTEGRATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER I HAVE WITNESSED. A COVENANT WITH EXTREMELY UPSETTING RACIAL COVENANTS ALONG WITH THE COMPANY TENTATIVE DESTRUCTION MULTIPLE TRYING TO REMOVE SUCH COMPANY CAN'T CALL A LOT OF MONEY AND- AND EXTENDED A COURT PROCESS AFTER PROPERTY ALREADY ZONED FOR DESIGN FOR MULTI FAMILY HELPING FUND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WE SHOULD NOT BE. WORKING WITH PRIVATE- PRIVATE OWNERS IN ONE PROJECT IN PARTICULAR THE PROPERTY ITSELF. IS THE ONLY MULTI FAMILY. THE ONLY THING IN THE WAY IS A- OUTDATED- WHAT. WOULD OWNER FROM THE NINE FOR. THAT PROHIBIT MORE FAMILY. IT LOOKS. OVER A HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CURRENTLY. I THINK FOR THE MANY COVENANTS RECORDED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE.

EXPLAINING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IN THESE RESTRICTED GOVERNMENT COVENANTS THE SOLUTION IS TO VERO VERY NARROWLY LIMITED REMOVAL THESE COVENANTS WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT. AFFORDABLE HOUSING I GUESS AT THE TIME I REACHED THE POINT THAT WHY WOULD WE NOT ALLOW 50% AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AS WE SEE THESE THESE OF. THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE OF A POOR AND TO THE TO WHERE WE I THINK MANY OF US THINK OF CALIFORNIA LAW. AND I SPENT SOME TIME THINKING ABOUT AS HE DID SUPPORT THE MATTER IN A IN HOUSING I'M GOOD AT STAYING THE DAY AND I GUESS IT'S A MINORITY VOTE BECAUSE I WELL I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR INDICATING THAT. THEIR SPONSORS ARE 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING- BUT ENTHUSIAST AND BUILDERS I THINK THAT THESE TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS AND SOME OF THE RECALL SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD TODAY FROM PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE THESE REMOVED. I WOULD LIKE TO ACCELERATE THAT AND ALLOW OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD COME IN TO REMOVE THESE RESTRICTIONS AND NOT JUST A THAT'S THE REASON. FOR MY EXTENSION ALREADY THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'D LIKE TO- START JOB BY ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND A COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING. VERY-DILIGENTLY ON THOSE AMENDMENTS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WILL ALLOW TRANSIT AGENCIES TO CAPTURE IMAGES OF VEHICLES THAT VIOLATE TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND BLOCKBUSTER OPS. DESPITE CLEAR MARKINGS AND SIGNAGE TRANSIT ONLY LANES ARE FREQUENTLY IGNORED. BUS ONLY LANE VIOLATIONS AND PARKED VEHICLES FORCED TRANSIT OPERATORS TO MANEUVER AROUND CONGESTED LANES AND MAKE DROP OFFS FURTHER FROM THE CURVE. CURB VIOLATIONS BECAUSE SERVICE DELAYS AND POSE SAFETY ISSUES TO DRIVERS TO RIDERS WHO NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE AND TWO OTHER VEHICLES AS WELL. CAMERA ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS IN SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HAVE SHOWN GREAT SUCCESS IN REDUCING VIOLATIONS AND IMPROVING TRAVEL TIMES. BOTH PROGRAMS REPORTED CLOSE TO IT 20% IMPROVEMENT IN ON TIME PERFORMANCE AND SAW A REDUCTION IN REPEAT VIOLATORS. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WILL PROVIDE TRANSIT AGENCIES WITH A COST EFFECTIVE TOOL TO ENSURE SAFE AND RAPID BUS SERVICE ESPECIALLY FOR BUSY STREETS WHERE IN PERSON PARKING ENFORCEMENT IS SIMPLY NOT REALISTIC. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN ALSO CONTAINS GUARDRAILS FOR CONSUMER AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. NEW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS MUST GIVE NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC ISSUE WARNING NOTICES IN ADVANCE OF IMPLEMENTATION AND PROVIDE OPTIONS TO REDUCE OR WAIVE THE COST OF CITATIONS. ADDITIONALLY IMAGES OF VIOLATIONS CAN BE RETAINED FOR NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND CAN ONLY BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF PARKING ENFORCEMENT. WITH THESE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WILL INSURE LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CITATIONS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING BUS RIDERS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE AND RAPID TRANSIT SERVICE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF A. B. NINE SEVENTEEN OR MICHAEL TURNER THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT LA METRO AND STEPHEN JONES THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE AT AC TRANSIT THANK YOU THANK YOU MR TURNER- MISTER JONES. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THIS IS MICHAEL TURNER ON BEHALF OF THE LA COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM MENTIONED THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES TO A FAULT INSTALL FRONT FACING CAMERAS ON OUR VEHICLES TO ASSIST WITH IMPORTANT FOR SMITH PARKING VIOLATIONS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES. AND THAT BUS STOPS IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR WRITERS AND HOW THIS PROGRAM FITS INTO THAT. IN LA COUNTY AS LATINO 15% IDENTIFY AS AFRICAN AMERICAN THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF METRO'S BUS WRITER IS LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE ABILITY OF THOUSANDS OF THESE WRITERS IS BEING DELAYED BY PEOPLE WHO PARK ILLEGALLY AND BUS ONLY LANES. FOR A SINGLE CAR THAT IS ILLEGALLY PARKED IN THE BUS LANE UP TO EIGHTY BUS RIDERS ARE DELAYED EACH MINUTE. THAT'S ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND RIDERS AN HOUR IF IT TAKES AN HOUR FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CLEAR THE BUS LINE. WITH THIS ADORED EACH METRO ANOTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN PARTNER WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE PARKING ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THE ONE IN REITERATE THAT WE ARE NOT ISSUING THE PARKING CITATIONS WERE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. WE'RE SPONSORING THE MEASURE TO AUTHORIZE THIS SO AS WE DEPLOY TRANSLATOR TRANSLATED FORSMAN PROGRAM BUT ALSO AS WE EXPAND OUR- TRANSIT ONLY LANE NETWORK WE CURRENTLY HAVE OVER TWENTY NINE MILES OF TRANSIT ONLY LANES BUT THAT'S EXPANDING TO- SIGNIFICANTLY. OVER THE NEXT- A FEW YEARS TO OVER A HUNDRED MILES. OF TRANSIT ONLY LANES IMPROVING THE SPEED AND RELIABILITY OF OUR BUS NETWORK THROUGH THIS MEASURE WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM AND WILL HELP INCREASE MOBILITY FOR MILLIONS OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND REDUCING CONGESTION. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE ALSO THAT ILLEGALLY PARKED CARS THE SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE ABOUT SOMETIMES HAS TO SWERVE INTO. TRAFFIC LANES IN ORDER TO- IN ORDER TO THE VIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFY AND I WILL STOP THEIR- THANK YOU MR TURNER- MISTER JONES. A GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR STEPHEN JONES AC TRANSIT EXTERNAL AFFAIRS REPRESENTATIVE URGING THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN MILLION TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO CONNECT THEM TO THEIR JOB MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS SCHOOLS AND OTHER ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES. BUT TRANSIT SYSTEM CANNOT PROVIDE A SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE TO THESE WRITERS WHEN MOTORISTS ILLEGALLY PARKED THEIR CARS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES OR TRYING TO STOP. ILLEGAL PARKING MAKES TRANSIT LAISSEZ LESS RELIABLE LESS ACCESSIBLE. AND LESS EQUITABLE EIGHTY TRANSIT 65% OF OUR WRITERS ARE LOW INCOME AND HALFOF OUR WRITERS DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESSTO A WORKING VEHICLE. THE FACT IS IT IS THE PUBLIC TRANSIT RIDERS WHO SUFFERS THE MOST WHEN MOTORISTS DELIVERY TRUCKS AND RIDE SHARE SERVICES PARK ILLEGALLY AND ABOUT THEM. CURRENT LAW A LOT OF THE TRANSIT USE CAMERAS TO DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL PARKING IN THE TRANSIT ONLY LANES OF OUR NEW BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM. THE CAMERAS ARE WORKING. ON AVERAGE WE ISSUE LESS THAN FOUR TICKETS PER DAY ON A LINE THAT CARRIES SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED RIDERS PER DAY AND IT'S PROJECTED THE CITY CARRYING AS MANY AS ELEVEN THOUSAND RIDERS PER DAY. OUR AVERAGE ON TRACK PERFORMANCE EXCEEDS 80% AND WE'VE RECEIVED ZERO PRIVACY COMPLAINTS. EVERY DAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RIDE OUR BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM BUT THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL DELIVER THEM SAFELY AND ON TIME GOOD JOB SCHOOL COMMUNITY SERVICES AND MORE. ALL CALIFORNIANS WHO RIDE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DESERVE THIS LEVEL OF SERVICE. EIGHTY NINE SEVENTY WILL HELP ENSURE THE TRANSIT RIDERS ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BENEFIT FROM A SAFER MORE RELIABLE MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MORE EQUITABLE PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION RT THANK YOU MISTER JONES OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF A.

GOOD AFTERNOON WE ARE SORRY I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA I WORK WITH PEOPLE BURIED UNDER THE WEIGHT A PARKING VIOLATION FOR MY CLIENT THE VIOLATIONS ARE A TREMENDOUS SOURCE OF INSTABILITY PASSING THIS BILL WOULD SEVERELY BURDENED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA BY GREATLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS ISSUED AN IMPOSING MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THAT. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS ISSUED PRELIMINARY DATA FROM AC TRANSIT SHOWS A FOUR HUNDRED AND 70% INCREASE IN THE TYPES OF VIOLATIONS ISSUED THROUGH THE PILOT PROGRAM THE TECHNICIANS WILL BURN SOME MORE THAN OTHERS LOW INCOME PEOPLE WILL BE HIT HARD BECAUSE THESE TEMPTATIONS DEPRIVE THEM OF A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME GIG WORKERS WILL BE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED I'M BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN WILL PAY A STEEP PRICE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF LEGAL THAT. WHETHER OR NOT THEY RECEIVE THE VIOLATION VIOLATION CAP CATASTROPHIC IMPACT FOR THOSE WHO MANAGE TO PAY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR VIOLATION THE MONEY MAY COME OUT OF FOOD BUDGET- RANTS OR CHILD CARE COSTS- PERMANENT LAND WHICH IS NOT A FAIR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS LYING AROUND FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T MANAGE TO PAY THE IMPACT EVEN WORSE VEHICLE REGISTRATION CANNOT BE RENEWED IF THERE'S OUT AND PARKING VIOLATION. TO THOSE TICKET TO THIS PROGRAM WHO DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY- COULD LOSE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE AND AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO RELIES ON THAT VEHICLE COULD LOSE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THERE BY THREATENING PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO WORK AND GET THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL THE BILL SPONSORED SUGGESTS THAT ALL OF THIS WILL BE BLUNTED BY ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT LARGELY ON TRAIL IT'S OUR EXPERIENCE THAT ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITHOUT LAWYERS ARE SPARSELY USED ANDCAN'T MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF BEING USED AND PUNISHMENTS FOR NON PAYMENT BEST PRACTICES IMPOSE A STEEPLY DISCOUNTED TO BE AUTOMATICALLY OR ISSUE WARNING AFTER THE FIRST. DEFENSE NOT VIOLATIONS. THOSE ARE SUPPOSE SHARE YOUR COME TO POWER TRANSIT WE SHOULD EFFICIENT RELY STATE AND SUSTAINABLE OP. WE DO COMPLETE FOCUS ON OTHERS. FOR THEM. BUT USING AUTUMN AND FOR.

I'M EITHER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN OPPOSITION EIGHTY NINE ON THAT AND SEE IF WE COULD CONSTRUCTIONS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES BY RELYING ON THE FALSE NOTION THAT INCREASED SURVEILLANCE IS AFFILIATION BUT THE FIVE HUNDRED OKAY THEN TENSION EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN GOES OO FAR BY FOSTERING THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY. FOUNDERS AND FUNDERS THAT MAKE SENSE OF THE RAP THAT THING HURTING THE USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CAMERAS ON PUBLIC BUSES AND A. L. PRT V. NINE NINE SEVEN RELIES ON THE FALSE NOTION FOR ME ON BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE AVAILABLE I COULD HOWEVER SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED AGAINST THE VERY CONSTITUENCIES. LANDLORDS ARE THINKING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO OAKLAND WHERE WE CAMERAS WERE INSTALLED ON A LINE THAT RAN THROUGH THE CITY WELL IT. HAPPENED IN KANSAS HAS. RED LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAM OFFERED. TALE YEAH I THAT FOR ME ON. TRAFFIC FROM. WELL THERE ARE BEEN IN. RADIO CHECK I'M- STUDY SHOW THAT RED THEY CAN'T ACT IN. CERTAIN TYPES OF COLLISION.

IT IS NINE ONE SEVEN GOLD MAYBE MAKING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MORE EFFICIENT IS IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NT THE SOLUTION I LOVE IT AND SO IN OUR OFFICE FIND OUT THERE ARE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF ACHIEVING CLEAR HAND THE ONLY LANE SECTION INSTRUCTING HER GO MEDIAN PREVENT CARS FROM PARKING ILLEGALLY.

MAXIMO CAROLINA ONE EIGHTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. NINE ONE EIGHTY EIGHT YOU MAY BE NEEDED. MAXIMO CAROLINE FOR FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON JUDY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAFER STREETS LA ECHOING ACLU'S OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED. THANK YOU. AND AT THIS TIME THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE. ALL RIGHTY WELL SPRING BACK TO FLOOR CAESAR WHITE HOUSE HIS MICROPHONE UP. YES I AM MR SURE I'M A LITTLE TORN HERE BECAUSE ON THE ONE SIDE I WANT TO SEE THE- BUS LANES FLOWING QUICKLY BUT- THE- AFFORDABLE R. OR- PEOPLE REPRESENTING POOR PEOPLE OF MY DISTRICT AND IN MY COUNTY HAVE. APPROACHED ME ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY HAVE SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. LOOKING ON THE SIDE OF THE IMPACT OF THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THE CARS AND PARK THEM OR OR INDEED. THE CARD. THE BUS LANE ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF PEOPLE OF FAT AND I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS TO THE AUTHOR TO GIVE IT A SIXTY DAY LIMIT BUT ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY CAN GIVE PEOPLE WARNINGS BECAUSE A LOT OF. A KID PEOPLE WARNING WHEN THEY'RE PARKED CARS PARKED THERE AND THERE COULD BE ALL THESE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT- OUTLINED IN THE STAFF REPORT RATHER THAN JUST A PICTURE OF THE CAMERA AND I WAS WONDERING I KNOW THAT THAT AMENDMENT WASN'T TAKEN I WAS WONDER IF I COULD HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR. ON THE- ONE FREE PASS OR WHATEVER WHICH EVERYONE A CALL AFTER THE SIXTY DAY PROHIBITION. THE WARNING TICKET. YEAH THE- OTHER NUMBER BELOW LET ME- DEFER TO US STEPHEN JONES FROM AC TRANSIT. ONE OF THE- THE IDEA OF A WARNING TICKET- FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PARK ILLEGALLY IN BUS ZONES WHAT MEAN THAT TRANSLATED TO- WOULD HAVE TO- MAINTAIN OR SPECIFICALLY LONG COURSE IT WOULD HAVE TO MAINTAIN A DATABASE TO IDENTIFY THOSE PEOPLE- BEEN HAVE MAYBE EARNED ASECOND FOR YOU KNOW THE FIRST FINE BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY- WARNING TICKETS. WERE- I COULDN'T IT WILL. AND THEN MAINTAIN THAT DATABASE SO THAT IF THAT PERSON- VIOLATES THE BOSS OF ME DOING AGAIN BUT WILL NEED TO KNOW THAT WELL THEY'VE JUST TURNED THEIR OFFICIAL FIRST. I NEVER. THOUGHT I WOULD YOU KNOW REQUIRE INDEFINITELY THE MAINTENANCE OF A DATABASE AND WE HAD NO INTEREST IN DOING THAT. SO WHAT I KNOW OF THE AC TRANSIT HAS A- A PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS BEING INCORPORATED INTO SOME BIG AND BEING MADE PERMANENT I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR FOR AC TRANSIT IS THAT. MY FIGURES SHOW THAT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S HAVE GIVEN OUT SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY KITS THAT WERE ISSUED BY THESE CAMERAS- AND MANY OF THEM AS THE OPPOSITION HAS POINT OUT OF MANY OF THEM ARE TO LOW INCOME. IN THREE YEARS SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN THERE'S ONLY BEEN THIRTY TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE IN THE LOW INCOME PAYMENT PROGRAM- AND IT JUST SEEMS IN ONE YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT TICKETS IN THREE YEARS THIRTY TWO PEOPLE SO NOBODY. I THINK IT'S IT IT APPEARS THAT THE PROGRAM IS THERE SO WE WANT TO HAVE LOW INCOME PEOPLE MAKE A LITTLE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR PAYMENT A MONTH BUT NOBODY'S DOING IT AND I WAS WONDERING IF ALAMEDA COUNTY COULD RESPOND TO. THAT MEEKER PARTICIPATION RATE. YEAH SO I THINK WHAT WE SEE IS THAT- WELL FIRST- WE DON'T KNOW THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE THE TICKETS- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU REFERENCE THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINE TO GET THE MACHINE. THIS YEAR- BUT LET ME LOOK- DISTRICT WIDE AT THE TICKET THAT- I'M SORRY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO PARTICIPATE IN THE LOW INCOME PLAN- PROGRAM- WE SEE THAT- THEY ARE- NOT PAYING ON THEIR NOT PARTICIPATING. THE PAY DOWN THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS FINE DISSOCIATED WITH. OUR CAMERA PROGRAM- THEY'RE PAYING FOR- FIND ASSOCIATED WITH FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE PARKING AT A- BUS STOP ORNATE NA- HANDICAP LOAN. AND THAT INFRACTION COULD BE. ANYWHERE THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT NOT ONLY LONG ARTICLE B. R. T. LINE. SO I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE REALLY IS A SITUATION WHERE. THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS FINE- WELL NOT INSUBSTANTIAL IS SOMETHING THAT MAYBE IS A LITTLE MORE MANAGEABLE FOR FOLKS- AND THAT- FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE. PARTICIPATING. IN THE LOW INCOME PAYMENT PLAN. THERE DOING SO DOING THEIR INSTALL THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR DID NOT. AND AND AGAIN YOU DON'T REALLY SEE- YEP AGAIN THE CROSS MILITARY TO INDIVIDUALS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF YEARS OR SO- PARTICIPATED IN THAT PLANT SO IT'S REALLY. ABOUT PLANNED- THE PARTICIPANTS- OPTUS STADIUM TO PAY DOWN THE LARGER FINES. I GUESS I GUESS MR CHERRY IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE THE APP THE OPPOSITION IS POINTING POINTING OUT THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HEAVY BURDEN IS GONNA FALL ON LOW INCOME DRIVERS AND WOMEN WOMEN% OF COLOR THAT HAVE ALL THESE DUTIES IN TRYING TO PARK THE CAR AND GET IN THERE THAT THAT'S IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT RECONCILING WHAT THE- AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE. PAYING THE FINE SIR- ARE NOT PROTESTING THE LOW INCOME PROGRAM ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR WHAT CAL STATE SENATOR ALSO. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I'M SORRY I MISSED THE BEGINNING OF THIS CONVERSATION- AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO I THINK OF THE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED IS THE IMPACT ON THE POOR PEOPLE- I SERVED ON. I SERVED ON A WALLACE CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB FIVE AND WE TOOK SEVERAL ACTIONS- ACTUALLY THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET- TOOK BUT- ACTION BUT ON THIS BUDGET WE TOOK AN ACTION OF. INCREASING FROM TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO HELP THE TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC IN OUR INFRACTIONS AND SO HERE WE ARE PAIN BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO PAY. FEES BOTH FOR TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS IT'S A DEBT THAT BUILDS ON THEM PERSONALLY IT'S A DEBT THAT WE'RE ONLY KIDDING OURSELVES AND NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY OFF BUT THERE'S-A REAL IMPACT ON THEIR ON THEIR LIVES THERE'S AN IMPACT ON. IF YOU HAVE THESE TICKETS YOU CAN GET REGISTRATION FOR YOUR CAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN OUTSTANDING PARKING FEE- AND THERE'S A PENALTIES COULD BE AS HIGH AS ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS SO- I AM. EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THIS- EVEN IF THERE'S A SUNSET DATE- THAT'S ANOTHER FIVE YEARS- THAT PEOPLE OF DEBT- THEY COULD GET THE TICKET THEY COULD STAY ON THERE STAY ON THE RECORDS AND THAT SO I THINK VERY DETRIMENTAL SO I'M- SORRY I'M SURE THERE'S A RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHOR. SEVEN NUMBER BLOOM YES- THANK YOU FOR THE- QUESTION THE- THAT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WAS OF CONCERN IN THE LAST THE- A COMMITTEE AND WE ADDRESSED IT BY- REQUIRING OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE FINE OR WITH- EVEN WAIVE THE TICKET TO- IN CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THE- AGENCY WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION. TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS IN THE PROPER CIRCUMSTANCE. AND THE- UHHUH WE BUILT IN A SIXTY DAY PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM- IT WAS A THIRTY NOW- WITH THAT TODAY'S AMENDMENTS A SIXTY DAY WARNING CITATION PERIOD AND- AS I SAID- OPTIONS MUST BE PROVIDED IT'S NOT DISCRETIONARY IT'S- THAT OPTIONS MUST BE PROVIDED TO REDUCE OR WAIVE THE COST OF A CITATION. FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE PROVISIONS I WOULD- ASK MEMBERS TO TAKE NOTE THAT TRANSIT RIDERS THEMSELVES ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN LA COUNTY. 66% OF BUS RIDERS IDENTIFIES LATINO 15% AS AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF METRO'S BUS RIDERS IS LESS THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND FOR AC TRANSIT THE STATISTICS ARE. ARE SIMILAR. HAVE THESE ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THIS BILL THEY DESERVE SAFE EFFICIENT BUS SERVICE AND THIS BILL TRIES TO DRAW THE RIGHTBALANCE- THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT- OF THOSE TICKETS THAT WERE ISSUED MANY OF THOSE WERE SURELY DELIVERY DRIVERS WHO ARE DELIBERATELY VIOLATING CUT THE BUS ONLY LANES AND- AND TNCS AS WELL WHO ORGANISED IT OTHER MAKING A LIVING- OUT THERE ON THE STREETS AND I REALIZE THAT FOR MANY OF THEM IT'S TOUGH BUT THEY CAN'T BLOCK BUS ONLY LANES IN THE PROCESS AND TO- THEY WILL BE THE FIRST. TO TAKE HEED OF WARNINGS I BELIEVE AND IT- AND TO NOT CONTINUE VIOLATING. RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST TOO EASY TO VIOLATE AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A PROLIFERATION OF VIOLATIONS AND BUS ONLY LANES. THANK YOU SO NUMBER OF SIR JOHN'S. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MR BLOOM I'VE I'VE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL AS WELL AS- GOING BACK AND FORTH ON AND I ACTUALLY CAME IN HERE- THIS AFTERNOON OPPOSED TO IT BUT- YOUR- OPENING WITNESS SAID SOMETHING THAT PIQUED MY INTERESTED I'D I'D MISSED IN THE ANALYSIS IN THAT- IT'S NOT THE- TRANSIT AGENCY THAT'S ISSUING THE CITATION IT'S- A LOCAL AGENT LA I. I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO EXPAND ON THE EXPLANATION THE LOCAL AGENCY THAT IS AUTHORIZED. TO ISSUE-THE CITATIONS AND THEN ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS. I APPRECIATED ABOUT THE BILL EVEN BEFORE COMING AS IT HAS TO BE REVIEWED BY A HUMAN BEING- IT'S ON AUTOMATIC- TICKET LIKE THE RED LIGHT TICKETS- USED TO BECAUSE I'M I WAS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THOSE- SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THOSE TWO THINGS- WHO WHO HAS THE AUTHORIZATION TO REVIEW THE VIDEO IN EACH OF THE CITATION AND WHAT AGENCIES. HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TO ISSUE THE CITATIONS AND I AND BEFORE ALL THAT I WANT TO SAY THAT I. AGREE WITH YOU IN YOUR ANSWER TO THAT- CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOW INCOME FOLKS BEING CITED VERSES THE LOW INCOME FOLKS ARE RIDING% ON THE BUS BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE PERSON IT'S INCONSIDERATE AND PARKS. IN THESE BUS LANES YOU'VE GOT DOZENS OF PEOPLE ON THE BUS- THAT MAY BE LATE TO WORK OR- A CHILD'S- DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT THE- IN. I THINK WE GET WE NEED TO BALANCE THAT SO I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT ANSWER BUT BACK TO MY QUESTIONS THE PERSON WHO. IS AUTHORIZED IN THE AGENCY THAT OPERATES PLEASE ONE ANSWER FOR TO A MISTER TURNER. WHO AGREES THAT ISSUE INITIALLY. OUR MISS TURNER THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU- THIS IS MICHAEL TURNER YEAH THIS WE SET THIS UP IN A IN A WAY. WHERE WE WOULD WANT TO SET THIS UP RATHER IN A WAY WHERE WE WOULD METRO WOULD NOT BE DOING. ANY OF THE PARKING UP ENFORCEMENT THE S. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THE TICKET. WOULD REMAIN WITH THE JURISDICTIONS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY WHICH IN OUR CASE IS MOSTLY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. SO WE WOULD- THE ROLE WE WOULD PLAY WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS A PARKING VIOLATION. AND IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- OR WHATEVER CITY THE- FACILITY IS pTICKET THROUGH THEIR NORMAL PROCESS THESE AND- OR THEY WOULD VALIDATE THE TICKET AND THEN ISSUE THE TICKET. THROUGH THEIR NORMAL PROCESS THESE BUT THEY WOULD ALSO PROCESS WHATEVER FINE- FEE WAIVER WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS THE PERSON THAT IS AUTHORIZED. TO REVIEW THE VIDEO AND- ISSUED A CITATION. YEAH WE WOULD- COORDINATE THAT WE HAVEN'T IDENTIFIED WHO EXACTLY WOULD DO THAT WHETHER THAT WOULD BE A METRO EMPLOYEE OR A CITY OF LOS ANGELES EMPLOYEE- BUT THERE WOULD BE A HUMAN THAT REVIEWS- THE VIOLATION TO ENSURE THAT IT'S VALID BUT IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE A POST OFFICE OR IT COULD JUST BE A- AN AGENCY STAFF MEMBER THAT'S TRAINED. IN THIS PARTICULAR. I THINK MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR TO BE A POST OFFICERS SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE- BUT- I'LL LET YOU ANSWER TO THAT. SEVEN NUMBER BELOW. ALLAH LET MISTER TURNER RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH I MEAN WE WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT IT WAS A POST OFFICER. ALL RIGHT- AND I SEE ALSO- SET A COUPLE EUROS MICROPHONES UP AND TURNED. YEAH I APPRECIATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL I YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND I AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR LAST COMMENTS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO MAKE MANY OF THE- OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU MADE WHICH IS THAT- WHAT. THIS REALLY IS A BALANCE BETWEEN- BETWEEN HAVING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE RULES AROUND WHERE YOU CAN. WHERE YOU CAN DRIVE AND WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING IT- OF SINK OR A FAMILY CAR BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A TRANSIT- LANE AND THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RELY ON IT AND DEPEND ON IT TO BE ON TIME AND- AND BE ABLE TO STOP AT THE STOP WHERE THEY NEED TO GET OFF AND- AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE EXCUSES ABOUT. WELL YOU KNOW POOR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY IT BUT I'M I'M IMPRESSED BY HOW- YOU YOU STRUCTURED IT SO THAT THERE'S SOME OPTIONS THERE'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION DISTRICT THERE'S- WARNINGS AND THEN THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE TRANSIT AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE. TO FORGIVE A FINER TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT WAY FOR IT TO BE PAID AND- AND THE REALITY THE SITUATION IS THAT POOR PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE MANY TIMES THEY HAVE TO TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT IT BE ON TIME AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH. WITH THE DETRACTORS OF THE CAMERAS IS THAT- IF YOU DON'T ENFORCE. PEOPLE DON'T PAY ATTENTION. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THESE RED LIGHT. PEOPLE WHO RUN RED LIGHTS DRIVE ME CRAZY. BECAUSE IF I MOVED WHEN IT TURNED GREEN I'D BE BROADSIDED MANY TIMES AND SO. AND PART OF THE PART OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE STOPPED ENFORCING. RED LIGHT WITH PATROLS AND SO THIS IS A VERY SIMILAR SITUATION WHERE I'M AT. NOT ENFORCING OR NOT HAVING ENOUGH STAFF TO ENFORCE THE RULES ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE SHOULD GO IF YOU IF YOU DON'T DO THE ENFORCEMENT THEN IT BECOMES WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE. AND I THINK THIS IS A BILL THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I AM CONCERNED YOU KNOW MY PRIORITIES ALWAYS BEEN WORKING FOLKS- BUT THEY GOT TO FOLLOW THE LOSS IN ONCE THEY GET A WARNING ONCE THEY THEY FIND OUT THAT- THAT THAT IT IS GOING TO BE ENFORCED I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE. ARE PROJECTED HERE SO- WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO- MOVED ABOUT. ALREADY THANK YOU OTHERS. THE OTHER COMMENTS NO OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IN A CYNICAL YOU'RE MOST BUILT IN THE HEART. THIS THIS IS THE CLASSIC CASE WE'VE GOT SOCIETAL VALUES THAT OUR ATTENTION WITH ONE ANOTHER- WHETHER IT'S THE ESCALADE DRIVER WHO JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T CARE AND PARKS IN THE TRANSIT LANE VERSUS THE DOOR DASH DRIVER WHO BASICALLY HAS TO PARK THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. THAT'S A TOUGH CHOICE THE TRANSIT LANES DON'T WORK THEN YOU HAVE LOW INCOME RIDERS WEREN'T USING TRANSIT OR CAN'T USE RANSIT EFFICIENTLY- YOU'VE GOT ALL SORTS OF DUE PROCESS ISSUES HERE IT IS YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO WHO'S GOING TO VALUE WAIT. THE VIOLATION OF WHETHER THERE'S GONNA BE SOME MITIGATION MEASURES SO THAT THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT- HAVE SOME SORT OF MITIGATION EASURE- THERE'S ALSO SOME ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO TECHNOLOGY I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM YOU WORKING WITH US ON THESE ISSUES- THAT'S WHY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO REPORT IN THREE YEARS AND THERE'S A SUNSET OF FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALSO ADDING AN ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME IN TERMS OF WARNING AND- I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS THEY INVOLVED BECAUSE THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR- ATTENTION TO THEM. ALL RIGHT HAVING SAID THAT- THEN SHE CANCELED THE CALL THE ROLL. THERE WAS A MOTION BY SOME A COUPLE EURO- I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I APOLOGIZE HI RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ALL RIGHT. GREAT CLOTHES ALL RIGHT- CYNICAL EURO. CENTER CAREER MOVES THE BILL WOULD NOT ACHIEVE COUNCIL OF YOU CALL THE ROLL NO WORRIES THIS IS ABC NINE ONE GAVIN HIRED. YES OKAY. ALL RIGHT TO GO. A. B.

NOT VOTING STERN NOT VOTING. WHITE HOUSE SKI WHITE HOUSE GATE NOT VOTING YOU HAVE SEVEN TWO ZERO WITH MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL ALL RIGHT- CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE BIDDING HERE- IN IN FILE ORDER NUMBER SIX ASSEMBLY PERSON POWER QUE HAN- ASSEMBLY MEMBER NUMBER TEN THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER CORREO- SO- NUMBER ELEVEN EIGHTY THIRTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CHARLES SENATOR CHARLES HERE ALL RIGHT SO YOUR CHILD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALSO WELCOME TO OUR GUESTS HERE IN THE GALLERY THANK YOU FOR COMING TO OBSERVE YOUR GOVERNMENT PROGRESS WITH PARTICULARLY LIKE TO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE SO THAT THEY CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHILD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS AT THIRTEEN WOULD ESTABLISH CRITERIA. FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF HYORI'S AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF BIASED. OR DISCRIMINATORY IMPACTS FROM THEIR DESIGN AND APPLICATION. THE USE OF AUGER THEM DRIVEN AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS OR ADAS. CAN ASSIST WITH CREDIT DECISIONS EMPLOYMENT SCREENING INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY MARKETING AND DELIVERY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES JUST TO NAME A FEW. HOWEVER PULLEY DESIGN ADS IS CAN ALSO CREATE AN UNFAIR BIASED AND INACCURATE RESULTS. CAUSING DISPROPORTIONATE HARM TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHILE ALSO UNDERMINING TRUST IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ACQUISITION OF THESE SYSTEMS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE MUST EXAMINE THE STATE'S PROCUREMENT POLICIES CLOSELY. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES NEED TO CONSIDER UNIQUE POLICY CHOICES INHERENT IN MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS. INSTEAD OF TREATING THEIR PURCHASES AS USUAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING DECISIONS AND FOCUSING SOLELY ON PRICE INNOVATION AND COMPETITION THEY SHOULD ALSO EXAMINE THE GOALS VALUES AND RISKS INVOLVED IN THESE SYSTEMS. OTHERWISE THEY MAY FAIL TO MEET PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS OF OVERSIGHT OF THE SYSTEMS. AND INADVERTENTLY CREATE NEW HARMS. LET ME SHARE SOME EXAMPLES WERE POORLY DESIGNED OR UNDERSTOOD. PUBLIC SECTOR AGRI MISSING- SYSTEMS HAVE CAUSED HARM TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE IN MICHIGAN IN AN EMPLOYMENT AUGUR THEM WRONGFULLY ACCUSED FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WELL FRAUD FORCING MANY OF THEM TO PAY HEAVY FINES. DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. OR HELP THEIR HOMES FORECLOSED UPON. IN MEDICAID WAS. LOST ACCESS HOME CARE NURSE VISITS. AND MEDICAL TREATMENTS. OF ERRORS IN IT THEM. DETROIT THE MARKET AND ARE THEM USE TO THE PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND TAX AND IT UP THERE A FIGHT COULD. FOR AWAY FOR THE DETROIT POOREST IN PREDOMINANTLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALLED WRITERS AWHILE AGO HE CORRECTLY TRANSLATED POLICY INTO AN AUTOMATED PUBLIC BENEFITS SYSTEM KNOWN AS CAL WIN. WHICH IMPROPERLY DENIED MEDICAID TO FOSTER CHILDREN IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW IT MOST RECENTLY AN ACLU STUDY SUGGESTS THAT AN AUGER THEM USE FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION MAY HAVE LEFT MORE THAN TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS. MANY OF THEM FROM BLACK AND LATINO X. COMMUNITIES WITHOUT PROPER VACCINE SUPPLY THE LIST GOES ON. SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH CLEAR GUIDELINES ON HOW TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAINED THE ABILITY OF THESE SYSTEMS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO DO THE FOLLOWING ONE IDENTIFY WHICH EDS IS OURHIGH RISK. TO CONDUCT AN INVENTORY OF ALL HIGH RES EDS IS THAT ARE BEING USED TO DEVELOP OR PROCURE BY PUBLIC AGENCIES THREE ENCOURAGE A PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTOR TO SUBMIT AN ADS IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT. TO EVALUATE THE PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY RESULT IN UNFAIR BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT FOR REQUIRED THE STATE AGENCY AWARDING A CONTRACT TO PROVIDE A COPY OF THE REPORT TO ALSO EXPLAIN. HOW THE PUBLIC CAN ACCESS AND CORRECT THE RESULTS AND FIVE MAKE THE REPORT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ONLINE IF APPROPRIATE. AS NOTED BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE LATITUDE OF USING THE BLACK BOX ALGORITHMS THAT INCREASINGLY CHARACTERIZE ORGANISMS DEPLOYED IN THE MARKETPLACE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THESE SYSTEMS DO NOT CREATE NEW HARMS CLOSE RACE TO THE LEGAL. LEGAL RIGHTS HEALTH AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF INDIVIDUALS- RESULT IN UNFAIR BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I WILL. THANK YOU SOMEONE THEM WERE CHA- DO ACCEPT THE MEMBER THAT ARE PROPOSED YES. YES THANK YOU- WE HAVE VINCENT LEE- I BELIEVE ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT MR LEE YEAH. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS VINCENT LIFE BEGAN ON BEHALF OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WHERE I WORK TO ENSURE THAT TECHNOLOGY CLOSES THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND BUILD ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. BUT YOU THE A. I. AND GOVERNMENT THE GALLERY. YEAH ONLY 30% OF AMERICANS ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS UP TO THE TASK OF MANAGING A I. PUT THE BOOKING THE BOND IS A DISTINCT LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN OUR GOVERNMENT. ESPECIALLY AROUND A. I. IN FACT YOU CAN TAKE WHAT HAPPENED AT MICHIGAN- OVER FORTY THOUSAND pUNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD BY THE ALGORITHM A COPY WHICH AGAIN OVER FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PURCHASE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER MICHIGAN WAS INVOLVED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. IT WOULD TURN OVER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THOSE AFFECTED THROUGHOUT ALL OF THIS THE AGENCY IN CHARGE HAD LITTLE OR NO IDEA OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS OR EXACTLY WHEN BROCK. INTACT INVESTMENT WOULD HELP PREVENT THIS OUTCOME BECAUSE IT WILL HELP THOSE IN CHARGE UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR SYSTEM WORKS AND RECOGNIZE THE ISSUES THAT LED TO MULTIPLE LAWSUITS AND THE DISASTROUS ROLLOUT OF THE SYSTEM. THIS IS WHY WE NEED THE WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA A. B. THIRTEEN OF THE WAY TO BUILD TRUST IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. AND PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND THE PUBLIC AT ALL THE MORE. AS WE TO MODERN AND IMPROVE GOVERNMENT SERVICES- AND YOU KNOW EIGHTY THIRTEEN IS VERY MUCH LIKE TOUCH REGULATION OF AUTOMATED DECISION. THAT WE TAKE STOCK OF ADMITTING HIRING A ITEM. WE KNOW WHEN WE'RE USING AI TO MAKE KEY GOVERNMENT DECISION. THAT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND OPTIONAL IMPACTED SENTIMENT A QUESTIONNAIRE CENTRALLY BUT AT THE BELLBIRD. AND GENERALLY WORK WHETHER THEY'RE A I CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARTICULATE DEPLOYED INCORRECTLY. AND HOW TO MINIMIZE THOSE RISKS. SIMPLY PUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TO CLOSE TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND WILL HELP THEM MAKE WELL INFORMED DECISIONS WHEN THEY PROCURE AUTOMATED DECISION. FINALLY A. B. THIRTEEN IS NARROWLY TAILORED ONLY APPLYING CASES OF GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT. ONLY INSTANCES WHERE- THE DECISIONS THAT SOME DETERMINED THAT THAT THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY HOW THE LEGAL RIGHT. THE DECISIONS AROUND YOU KNOW PUBLIC BENEFITS ELIGIBILITY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SENTENCING OR HOW. IT ALL AREAS WHERE THE RISK OF A WRONG DECISION AT HIGH AND YOU KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT HAS A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO GET IT RIGHT. AND THEN THANK YOU MR. OKAY YES- NO FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. OTHERS IN SUPPORT IN THE GALLERY SEEING NONE.

APOLOGIES I DON'T DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS NOT NEEDED ON MY END- BUT- ROAD WHICH WOULD HELP ME CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE SEXUALLY OPPOSED AB THIRTEEN I'M ARE BEGINNING A DEBATE ON POLICY CONCERNS AS WELL ACTUALLY THE BILL. AT A POLICY LEVEL WE SEE AB THIRTEEN IT DRIVING UP THE DIFFICULTY OF BIDDING PARTICULARLY FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS AND THEREFORE INCREASING COUGH BOTH BUSINESSES AND STATE WITHOUT A CLEAR COMMENSURATE BENEFIT- I THINK KNOWLEDGE THE A MAN. WE APPRECIATE THE INTENTION BEHIND THE CRAZY MAN WE DO NOT DEMAND THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THE CORE ISSUES WITH MAGNUS RUNNING-THE DEFINITION OF AUTOMATED DECISION SYSTEMS FOR HIGH RISK APPLICATION- I DON'T LIKE THE FLAG THAT DESPITE THEM AS SOME AMBIGUITY THE TESTIMONY. BY NO MEANS LIMITED TO MACHINE LEARNING AND THOSE KIND OF SITUATIONS WHERE THAT THAT SYSTEM INTRODUCING ITS OWN RULES IN FACT QUITE BROAD- ALSO LIKE THE BLACK BACKGROUND ISSUES HERE THEY'RE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. PERSON CALLING FOR PRIVATE CORRECT THAT WILL INCLUDE TOUCHING ON THE TOPIC OF AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING SYSTEM AND WE DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING DEPARTED MELODY DRAFTING SIMILAR OR POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING DEFINITIONS OF THE THING TERM AT THE SAME TIME. THERE'S A LOT THAT THE PRH A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT MEET THAT TERM. ALSO IS LIKE THE FLAG AT THE CORE CONCERN HERE'S DISCRIMINATION AND UNINTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION BY- PROBABILITY WE DON'T. WE DON'T ACTUALLY COVERED BY. THE UNREASONABLE RIGHT BACK HAS FALLEN- MY CONTRACT THAT ENTITY SECURING THE UP SOME SOFTWARE THAT HELP SORT THAT THE- FROM A- WE'LL PUT IT DOWN TO. BECAUSE IN THE COSTS. AND THEN IF. DISCRIMINATION OCCURRED IN THE EIGHTEEN WITHIN SUED RELATED-THAT. THE BURDEN WOULD ALREADY ON THE APPLICANT BRINGING THE SOFTWARE SO WE DON'T THE DISCRIMINATION AS AN OUTSTANDING CONCERN GIVEN THAT FRAMEWORK- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE HOPEFULLY BEFORE KIND OF TIME. THAT WE DO NOT SEE THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS THAT MUST ACCOMPANY THE APPLICATION IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO DO ARE THEY A QUESTIONNAIRE AS QUOTED BY BELIEVE THAT THE SPONSOR. IF YOU LOOK TO THE TOPIC AND- SECTION. TWELVE ONE ONE FIVE THREE. THREE IF YOU WOULD GO AHEAD AND WRAP IT UP. WELL YES SORRY- BASE AMID CONCERNS WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND- ARE RESPECTED THANK YOU.

HI I'M I'M TRYING TO CALL IN IN SUPPORT BUT FOR SOME REASON THE PHONE WASN'T PICKED UP THIS IS TRACY ROSENBERG ON BEHALF OF OAKLAND PRIVACY CALLING TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY THIRTEEN. THANK YOU. AND NOT ONLY HAVING Q. THE FOUR FIFTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION AND WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE AT THE CHAMBER THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU. OTHERS IS POOR OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE. THERE ARE NONE IN Q. ALL RIGHT BACK TO THE CHAMBER CENTER BOARD JUST. THANK YOU CHAIR. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING TIME TO CHAT WITH ME- WE SPOKE AT GREAT LENGTH- A FEW TO A FEW DAYS BACK AND- I'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT THIS IS THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE- BUT I THINK AT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I EXPRESSED. TO YOU WERE ON BEFORE I THINK STILL STANDS- AND I. IF YOU ALLOW ME I THINK I'D LIKE TO KIND OF WALK JUST WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE VULNERABILITIES- IN THE PROPOSAL. AND A. I. IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE IN HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST- WITH CERTAIN PRIVACY RELATED MATTERS- THE CONFINES OF HOW AI IS INCORPORATED INTO OR OR DAILY LIFE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL RIGHT HERE IS THAT. A. I. IS BUILT ON DATA. AND PREDICTIVE DATA. SO THAT POLICY MAKERS OR- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THE CONSUMERS OF THAT INFORMATION USE IT AS A AS A AS pA PLATFORM. FOR A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS SO. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE BIAS THAT'S ALREADY BUILT IN- TO THE INFORMATION GATHERING ALGORITHM. AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC AND THEN SOMETIMES IT IS SELF REALIZING OVER TIME. I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT THEY CAN MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT BETTER AND OF COURSE I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU THIS YEAR BILL. ONE IS. THESE THESE BUSINESSES COBBETT IN VALUE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEY HAVE EVERY REASON TO PROTECT THAT INTEREST AND BY FORCIBLY DISCLOSING INFORMATION ABOUT THE UNDERLYING FACTUAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO A PLATFORM LIKE THIS. COULD REALLY COULD REVEAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SO THE IDEA OF MAKING THE FINDINGS ARE PUBLIC I THINK IT'S TERRIBLY DANGEROUS ANIMAL DISINCENTIVE EYES BUSINESS FROM WANTING TO MOVE INTO PUBLIC CONTRACTS. AND SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I HAD TO YOU AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER ITS MERITORIOUS OR NOT IS NOT MAKING THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC. IN ANY FASHION THAT WOULD REVEAL THE INTELLECTUAL OUR OUR PRODUCT. THE OTHER IS- THERE SHOULD BE A SELF CORRECTING AUDIT SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE- MEDIC IN THE- THE RISK ASSESSMENT OR WHATEVER THE REPORTING TERMINOLOGIES USED IN HERE IS THAT IF AN ALGORITHM REVEALS A DISPARATE IMPACT FOR AN UNINTENTIONAL DISPARATE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS BEING SINGLED OUT BY VIRTUE OF THE AREA MODELING. THAT THERE BE A CORRECTIVE INTERNAL PROCESS THAT THE STICKER PARTICIPATE IN. BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE I THINK ONE OF THE CALLERS POINT OUT IS THAT DO WE HAVE THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO GET INTO THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND I THINK- WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT TOGETHER- THIS I THINK WOULD BE A PERFECT- BUILD TO MOVE INTO A TWO YEAR PROCESS IN MY ESTIMATIONS I THINK. THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE SOME STRONG MERIT TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING I HAVE ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR THIS AUTHOR. AND DIVING DEEP INTO THIS AREA. BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM. ALLOWING IT TO BE PUBLIC. COULD DISINCENTIVE VICE PUBLIC CONTRACT- PURSUITS. FROM INDIVIDUALS THAT WANT TO PROTECT. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE NOT GOING TO- ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AND PARTICIPATE. IN MAKING IT. OPEN TO THE PUBLIC I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT CALIFORNIA BRIEF BUREAUCRATS. REVIEWING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIRD PARTIES HAVING PUBLIC ACCESS TO DATA POINTS OR INFORMATION THAT COULD BE STOLEN AND RE APPROPRIATED ELSEWHERE IN INDUSTRY AND OVERSEAS. SO WITH THOSE I'M I'M GONNA PROBABLY REFER RESPECTFULLY DECLINED TO SUPPORT AT THIS TIME BUT I THINK IT HAS SOMETHING THERE I WOULD JUST WISH YOU COME BACK NEXT YEAR WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE VETTING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THOUGH FULLY RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ALREADY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD HE WAS RESPONDING YOUR CLOSE UP I'LL RESPOND RIGHT OUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YEAH WELL SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO CHAT WITH ME THE OTHER DAY AND I DEFINITELY RESPECT YOU FOR. YOUR POSITION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA AND ALSO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN FACT- YOU KNOW I'LL BILL REALLY DOES NOT. REQUIRE THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY PARTICULAR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON THE PART OF THE VENDOR IN FACTORIES VERY SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW. PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE US WITH ANY TRADE SECRETS OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND ON TOP OF THAT THE CD T. WHEN IT RECEIVES ANY POTENTIAL TRADE SECRETS OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHOULD NOT DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION. TO IT UNTIL A THIRD POINT IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY WE ARE ASKING WE ARE ENCOURAGING THE VENDORS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION IN THE FORM OF A- IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT. YET THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO SO AND WHEN THEY DO PROVIDE INFORMATION DATE TOTALLY HOW THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT TO DISCLOSE AND WHAT NOT TO DISCLOSE TO THE CDT. SO THERE IS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T DON'T DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THESE VENDORS ENTRY SEQUENCE AND WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. N. ON TOP OF THAT THESE VENDORS. BEING THE. SUPPLIER OR THE ODD MAN YOUR THANK THESE FROM THEY ARE SHOULD KNOW THEY HAVE. AS TO WHAT IS SO WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE TRADE SECRETS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TODAY SHOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO DISCLOSE TO DECIPHER WHAT IS. OUR PROPRIETARY VERSUS NON PROPRIETORY STILL AND THEN R. AS FAR AS THE SELF CORRECTING MECHANISM YEAH I THINK THAT'S ALREADY KIND OF BUILT IN BECAUSE WHEN WE DO ASK THE VENDOR TO PROVIDE THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT. WEDNESDAY CONDUCTED HOUSE THEY WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO ESSENTIALLY FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR SYSTEM IF ANYTHING- HIGH LIKE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THEIR SYSTEM. THEY DISCOVERED THAT YOU KNOW THEIR SYSTEMS WOULD CREATE SOME KIND OF BIASED OR DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ON PEOPLE THEN D. SHOULD HAVE THEYOU KNOW THE KNOWLEDGE TO ACTUALLY OUR SELF CORRECT. TO THE WOULD BE AUDITING THEMSELVES WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR INDEPENDENT AUDITING FIRM AND OUTSIDEWITH THIRD PARTY. VENDOR BUT YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY WE'RE ASKING THEM TO TELL US WHAT STEPS THEY HAVE TAKEN TO. BASICALLY A MEDICARE OR OR- ADDRESS DIVISIVE SITUATION. BUT BUT YOUR POINT IS OUT OF WHAT HE CAN TO. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SINGLE OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED AS THEIR MOTION. SO WHAT COUNTS CAN MOVE THE BILL. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU SILLY MEMBER CHILD FOR YOUR- YOUR YOUR- WILLINGNESS TO MEET. AND TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE COMMITTEE- IN PARTICULAR CHANGING THE BILL FROM BEING A REQUIREMENT TO BEING ENCOURAGED. OTHER SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS THAT I THINK- NARROW THE SCOPE OF A NUMBER OF DEFINITIONS- AND HAVING SAID THAT- MANAGE ACCOUNT SO IF YOU WOULD CALL THE ROLL. OH I'M SORRY IT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I ASK FOR YARD ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO. THIS IS ABC THIRTEEN BY A FAMILY MEMBER CHILD. BUT WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG. AMBERG I'VE FORGES. FOR JUST NOT VOTING KERR YET ALL. DID I SO DID I SO I. GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HURTS BERG. TODD JONES. JONES NO LAYERED LAYERED ICE SKINNER STERN STERN I WACO SKI WHY CASKEY I YOU HAVE SIX TO ONE WITH MEMBERS MISSING ALREADY WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT ON CALL- I HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT HOUSEKEEPING ANNOUNCEMENT THAT- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A MANDATORY BUDGET MEANING THAT'S ABOUT TO COMMENCE- I THINK THE FOOD IS HERE FOR DINNER IF IT IS NOT IT WILL ARRIVE MOMENTARILY SO THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE REQUIRED TO DEPART FOR THE BUDGET BY THE TABLE AND- WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY BREAK FOR DINNER WE'RE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO PLOW ON THROUGH- WE'RE MAKING A GREAT DEAL PROGRESS WE'RE WE'RE NEARLY HALFWAY DONE WE HAVE EIGHTEEN MORE BILLS TO HERE. SO HAVING SAID THAT I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HAND IS HERE. I DO NUMBER SIX A. B. ONE THREE FIVE SIX- AND LET ME LET ME INQUIRE ALSO. THE SERVER MARKET ARE YOU ALL YOU'RE ALSO PRESENT PRESENTING- SOMEONE OR LOWS BILLS WELL- AND THAT IS ITEM. NUMBER THIRTY THREE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FOLLOWING ALONG. WITH YOUR PROGRAM ALL RIGHT. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR TERREL TAKE A BABY THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX FIRST FIRST ON THE AGENDA I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE EXTENSIVE WORK TO ENSURE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. AND THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE WRITTEN STATEMENT TO PREVENT POSTING OF IMAGES OF PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS THEY WERE FINE THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE INTENT TO INTIMIDATE THEY HAD AN EXPRESS EXEMPTION FOR THE PRESS AND CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. WITH THAT TODAY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX A BILL THAT UPDATES OUR LAWS TO ADDRESS THE INSIDIOUS THREATS THAT PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA FACE. ROE VERSUS WADE IS THE LAW OF THE LAND PEOPLE HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SEEK REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE HOWEVER DAILY PROTESTS AND INCREASING HARASSMENT ONLINE NOW FUNDAMENTALLY THREATEN THIS RIGHT EVERY DAY PATIENTS ARRIVE AT CLINICS AND AGREED WITH CAMERAS IN THEIR FACES HARASSMENT PHYSICAL INTIMIDATION AND THREATS OF ONLINE BOXING. THESE PATIENTS ARE MOSTLY UNINSURED AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WOMEN OF COLOR THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ANONYMITY AT A HOSPITAL AS I DID WHEN I WAS PREGNANT. THEY ARE TARGETED BASED ON ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE THAT THEY'RE SEEKING. TODAY EXTEND BEYOND THE CLINIC ENTRANCE NEW CAMERA CAPABILITIES ALLOW PROTESTERS TO FILM AND IDENTIFY PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. SO THAT THEIR HELPER RIGHTS MEAN NOTHING. PROTESTERS POST THESE IMAGES ON WEBSITES TARGETING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND MAKING PROVIDER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE ONLINE TO MILLIONS OF USERS. THIS DOXING THREATENED LIVES CURRENT LAW IN THE FACE ACT WAS WRITTEN DECADES AGO AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE SEVERITY OF THE THREAT. PROTESTER GROUPS ARE WELL ORGANIZED AND WELL FUNDED THE LOW FINES AND PENALTIES HAVE SIMPLY NOT DETERRED THEM. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE PRIVACY AND PHYSICAL SAFETY OR PRE REQUISITES FOR ACCESSIBLE HEALTHCARE ESPECIALLY REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. SOMEHOW WE'VE ACCEPTED THE STATUS QUO. OVER PENALIZES MARIJUANA POSSESSION BUT LEAVE THESE YOUNG WOMEN OF COLOR VICTIMS OF DEATH THREATS SIMPLY FOR SEEKING TREATMENT. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX UPDATES ARE LOST TO INCREASE FINES FOR THE ONLINE HARASSMENT AND INTENTIONALLY TERRORIZING PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. IT ALSO INCLUDES NEEDED TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ACTUALLY TO ACTUALLY PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES AND PROTECT CLINICS. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF A. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX I'M JOINED VIA PHONE BY STEVEN MENDOZA SECURITY SPECIALIST AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD PASADENA AND SAN GABRIEL VLLEY. AND LEAVE THEM OFF THE BOARD.

AND WE'RE WORKING EXTREMISTS HAVE TARGETED HARASSED AND THREATENED ABORTION PROVIDERS FOR DECADES BECAUSE LIKE ACTIVE VIOLENCE AGAINST PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS. HEALTH CENTERS ARE SEEING A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THREATENING SECURITY INCIDENTS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. THE TACTICS OF ANTI ABORTION EXTREMIST BIRD RESTED AND DESIGNED TO FRIGHTEN AND INTIMIDATE PATIENTS FROM SEEKING MUCH NEEDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND CLINIC STAFF AND PROVIDING THAT CARE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED FOR THEIR SAFETY AND PRIVACY. UNFORTUNATELY FOR TOO LONG THERE'S BEEN A CULTURAL COMPLACENCY AROUND EIGHTY ANTI ABORTION TERRORISM WHICH HAS HELPED IN BOLDON IN NORMAL LIFE THREATENING BEHAVIOR OUTSIDE. OF THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. IT THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX UPDATED THE THING OF. THAT SPECIFICALLY PROTECT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS TO REFLECT THE REAL THREAT THE DIGITAL AGE. THESE PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS FACE HARASSING AND THREATENING BEHAVIORS THAT THEY WALK OR DRIVE TO THEIR DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS OR TO WORK. THE CASE BEING RECORDED BY BODY CAMERAS GOT TO PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW THEM AS THEY APPROACH THE BUILDING OR HAVEN'T FOUND THEIR THEIR CARDS BEING BILLED AS A PARKING ENTER THE HELP CENTER. FOR PATIENTS ARE TRYING TO ACCESS SENSITIVE SERVICES THESE ACTIONS INCITE FEAR TO DETERRENT ON. GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED AND IN DANGER THAT BY WIDELY IDENTIFYING THEM ONLINE AS PATIENT TO PROVIDER OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. PATIENTS THAT HAVE A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO PRIVACY WHEN ACCESSING IMPORTANT SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND THEY SHOULD BE FREE OF INTIMIDATION AND THREATS.

AND MISTER CLEAR WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE IN THE QUEUE ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- I SEE NO MICRO ALL I DO SEE ONE WOULD RAISE CENTER BY CAL SKI. YES- MISTER CHAIR I'VE I FEEL COMPELLED TO SAY SOMETHING AS A LEGISLATOR- WHO'S IT READILY. SADLY SAY TO FOLKS THAT I'M PRO CHOICE AND I HAVE A 100% VOTING RECORD IN MY ELEVEN YEARS HERE I'M ALSO AN ATTORNEY. AND THIS LEGISLATION CAUSES ME IS A GREAT CONCERN LET ME EXPLAIN IT'S OFTEN THE CASE WITH FIRST AMENDMENT. RIGHTS TO FREE SPEECH AND FREE EXPRESSION IT'S EASY SUPPORT FREE SPEECH WHEN YOU LIKE THE SPEECH THAT YOU'RE HEARING. BUT IT'S FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT THE RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH WHEN YOU FIND THE MESSAGE REPUGNANT. AND THAT'S PRECISELY THE TIME THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO DEFEND THIS RIGHT. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS MADE HAD MANY- A MAN MR TAKEN BY THE BY THE AUTHOR BUT IT DOES CALL OUT THE FACT THAT THE EXISTING CRIMES ARE NOT BEING PROSECUTED PROSECUTED IN SOME PLACES IN OUR STATE. BUT I CANNOT VOTE TODAY TO SUPPORT. OF ONE HUNDRED FOOT A PRUNER AROUND THE HEALTH FACILITY JUSTIN THIS IS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A HUNDRED FOOT PRIMER AROUND A- GUN STORE OR COURTHOUSE. THIS BILL MAY NOT BE DISCRIMINATORY ON ITS FACE IT'S PLAINLY DISCRIMINATORY IN THIS FACT FOR THOSE REASONS AS A STAUNCH PRO CHOICE SENATOR AND A SUPPORTER OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS. I REGRETTED REGRETTABLY CANNOT SUPPORT IT TODAY. THANK YOU SO I CAL SKI- SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED. IS THERE A MOTION YES AND A CONSULT. SENATORS ALSO MOVES THE BILL ALL RIGHT- SOME REMEMBER DO YOU CARE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR CHAIR I'LL JUST ADDRESS THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUE- HI TO BETTER TOURNEY AND ONE WHO BELIEVES DEEPLY IN THE CONSTITUTION THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT BUT AS YOU AND THE MANY LAWYERS HAVE TOUCHED THIS INCLUDING A PLANNED PARENTHOOD THE ACLU AND THE COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE BEEN BEFORE. WE ARE ALLOWED TO RESTRICT SPEECH WHEN THERE IS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST AND IT IS NARROWLY TAILORED I WOULD FIRST SAY THAT THE FACE ACT IS ALREADY IN LOS SO MOST OF THIS IS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE AND IS CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE IS A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST TO ENSURE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THAT MEANS ALL HEALTHCARE INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. AND WE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD TO NARROWLY TAILOR THIS BILL TO ENSURE. THAT THOSE. YOU WANT TO SPEAK HAVE THE RIGHT TO AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO. BUT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO INTIMIDATE. THREATEN AND STOP THESE PATIENTS FROM GETTING THE HEALTHCARE THEY DESERVE. SO I STAND FIRMLY BEHIND THIS BILL BELIEVE IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVATE. THANK YOU MADAM CHIEF COUNSEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL YES IS AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX BY A FAMILY MEMBER. OUR K. HAAN- BUT THE MOTION BY SENATOR GONZALES. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG. AMBERG BY BARGES. HEAVY AT ALL. THE RUSSELL GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HURTS BURKE. JONES JONES NO LAYERED SKINNER STERN STERN I WAKE HOUSEKI NO WHITE HOUSE SKI KNOWS SO FAR YOU HAVE TO READ IT TO YOU WITH MEMBERS MISSING. ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL- NEXT TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BARK AND YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT ITEM NUMBER THIRTY THREE WHICH IS- A. B. TEN EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOW SAT CORRECT YES THANK YOU GUYS FOR TRAVELERS YEARS- I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR YOUR THOROUGH ANALYSIS THIS BILL REQUIRES A RETAILER WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE GENDER NEUTRAL RETAIL SECTION OF TOYS IN CHILD CARE ITEMS IF THEY CHOOSE TO MAINTAIN THE LABELING OF KIDS SECTIONS BY BOYS AND GIRLS. THE RETAILER CHOOSES TO SIMPLY LABEL TOYS OUR KIDS HE DID DISH ON GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION WILL NOT BE NECESSARY IN TODAY'S CULTURE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE STOP REINFORCING GENDER NORMS THEY CAN BE HARMFUL. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT APPLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE KOBE NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS LESSENING KIDS START GOING BACK TO SCHOOL WE WANT TO PROCESS THEIR SHOPPING TO BE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE AFTER AN UNPRECEDENTED YEAR OF STRESS WE ARE CREATING A WELCOMING PLACE FOR ALL CHILDREN SO THEY CAN WEAR WHAT THEY LIKE AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE STEREOTYPES OF THE ONLY BLUE FOR BOYS AND ONLY PINK FOR GIRLS. AS A MOTHER MYSELF WHO HAS BOTH SONS AND A DAUGHTER I'VE TAKEN MY CHILDREN TO STORES AND BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD TO GO TO A SECTION LABELED BOYS IN ORDER TO GET TOYS THAT ALLOWED HER TO BUILD OR DO SCIENCE. THE GENDER STEREOTYPES THAT ARE BEING REINFORCED OUR STORES TODAY LEAVE A CHILD TO FEEL JUDGED OR IS IT THE ACTIVITY BUT HERE SHE IS CHOOSING ISN'T APPROPRIATE. AND SO THIS IS A SIMPLE CHANGE THAT. THAT STOPS THE STEREOTYPES FROM BEING REINFORCED AND ENSURES THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE WELCOMED EVERYWHERE. OUR OWN INCLUDING ABERCROMBIE H. AND M. OLD NAVY JOHN LEWIS AND ZARA WHICH ONCE UNISEX APPAREL LINES FOR KIDS MEANWHILE TARGET MADE HEADLINES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN IT DECIDED TO DO AWAY WITH THOSE GENDER BASED SCIENCE IN SOME DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND TOYS. THE LITTLE GIRL LIKE MY DAUGHTER WANTS TO SIGN SKATER DINOSAUR TOY TO PLAY WITH SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK ME TO TAKE HER TO A VOICE SECTION SHE SHOULDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S BUYING THE WRONG WAY WE SHOULD SIMPLY LET THESE KIDS BE KIDS. THIS WON'T HURT ANYONE BUT IT COULD DEFINITELY HELP A LOT OF CHILDREN. WITH ME TODAY IS BRITAIN SIRES AND ANJALI SOURCE ON BEHALF OF ROBERT SMITH AND THE FOOD PRODUCT. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH. CORPORATE INSIDERS ARE THE VIEW YOUR AVAILABLE. I DO NOT SHARE PROGRAMS WITH A I DON'T B. MATH ON THEIR- ALL RIGHT. THEIR CHAIRMAN RIGHT CHECK OUR NUMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE NINE MY NAME IS BRITAIN PARDON I'M NINE AND A HALF YEARS OLD I THINK YOU MAY KNOW AB TEN EIGHTY FOURTH TURNED OUT OF MY YEAH BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD GET THIS FAR THERE ARE SO MANY LITTLE KIDS OUT THERE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY FIT INTO SOCIETY'S EXPECTATIONS IT CAN BE SO HARD FOR THEM TO LOOK AT A PARTY IN THE GIRLS SECTION FOR TORY DANCER IN THE BOYS SECTION AND FEEL EYES ON THEM AS THEY WALKED INTO. A SECTION LABELED FOR THE OPPOSITE GENDER I ASK WHO ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ME BUT NOT EVERY KID HAS I CAN JUST IMAGINE A CHILD BEING PULLED OUT OF A SECTION LABELED FOR THE OPPOSITE GENDER WELL WHAT IF IT WASN'T LIKE THAT WHAT IS THE TWENTY THIRD TEARING DOWN THE WALLS BETWEEN ACTS ACTS ACTS WINES AND MADE SO MANY KIDS FEEL. LIKE THEY BELONG YEAH I MEAN I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE KIDS. FEEL COMFORTABLE PLAYING WITH TOYS FROM. FROM BOTH A GIRL AND BOYS TO. THANK YOU. THANK ALL RIGHT- I THINK MISS SOURCES TESTIFYING- IN LIEU OF MISTER SMITH IS THAT CORRECT. ZUMA'S SORES ON THE PHONE. WELL LET'S LET'S GO TO OTHERS AND SUPPORT IN THE MISS SOURCE TURNS UP WILL ALLOW HER ENOUGH TO TESTIFY ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORTING THE GALLERY SEEING NONE IN- ROOM ONE TWELVE SEEING NONE ON THE PHONE LINES MR THE PHONE LINES THOSE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU AREN'T A PART OF AB ONE ZERO EIGHT OR PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO THE LINE OF FOUR EIGHTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THIS IS TOMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER LINE REALLY Q. DANIEL GOOD CARE OF ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ALREADY LET'S NOW TURN TO. HELLO HELLO YES. THIS IS ANDRE PARK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SPEAK BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU COULDN'T HEAR ME ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOW ON THE LINE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU BRIGHTEN YOUR LEADER AND AN INSPIRATION I FELT WOULD BE WISE TO LISTEN TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE MORE. HI MY NAME IS ANJALI FORTHCOMING EXECUTIVE AT THE FLUID PROJECT AND GENDER FREE FASHION BRANDS I DON'T GET TO IT OUR GENDER BENDING EXPANDED TRAINING PLATFORM OPERA CORPORATION I'M THINKING TODAY THE PROFESSIONAL INVOLVED IN THE SPACE BUT ALSO AS A MOTHER. A MOTHER WHO IS TRYING HARD TO READ HER CHILD FREE FROM OUTDATED GENDER ROLES AND STEREOTYPES THAT SOCIETY PLACES UPON US. LET'S BEGIN BY NOTING THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING TODAY IS NOTHING NEW LIKE WE HEARD EARLIER MAJOR RETAILERS ARE ALREADY ADOPTING MEASURES TO BE GENDER THE DEPARTMENTS. TARGET HAS ADOPTED GENDER NEUTRAL BABY CLOTHING DATE THE GENDERED TOYS AND BEDDING AND WHO WILL DO THE SAME. WITH KIDS SHOES- IF I USE MY THE- MY SON PLAYS WITH HIS DOLL. THESE CALL AND TAKE WALKS IN THEIR STROLLER AND I'M INCREDIBLY PLEASED BY THEIR BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THIS PRACTICE. CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MORE SENSITIVE CARING HUMAN UNFORTUNATELY DESTROYED WOULD BE CONSIDERED GIRL WICE BY MANY. BAD BASKETBALL. HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE SOCIETAL EXPECTATIONS AROUND GENDER IMPACT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. WE ARE LIMITED BY GENDER BINARY CONSTRUCTS ALL OF US. BOYS ARE RAISED FULL OF AMBITION OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS HOLD WHICH CHOICE THEY CAN PLAY WITHIN WHICH THEY CAN. GIRLS ARE TAUGHT TO BE NURTURING ME AND CRYING BUT EQUALLY LIMITING SELECTION OF TOYS. IF YOU WALK THROUGH A TYPICAL RETAILER YOU WILL FIND A GIRL SECTION FULL OF PINK AND GLITTER WITH LANGUAGE. LIKE MILE STAY HAPPY. BUT OTHER SIDE OF AISLE WITH BLUE AND GRAY WITH GLAND READING. LEGEND FUTURE- HOPEFULLY RETAILERS WILL WAKE UP ONE DAY BUT HOW MUCH LONGER WILL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAVE TO WAIT. CHILDREN WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PLAY AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN CREATIVITY GROW UP TO HAVE A GREATER AWARENESS OF THEIR IDENTITY AND SELF ESTEEM AND BECOME AGENTS OF GENDER EQUALITY. I REALIZE THIS MAY SEEM. SMALL AND PERHAPS INCONVENIENT FOR SOME BUT DECONSTRUCTING THE AREA IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF UNLEASHING A YOUNGER PERSON FULL POTENTIAL. WE ARE CAPABLE OF AND I BELIEVE RESPONSIBLE TO CREATE SAFE SPACES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR ALL PEOPLE REALLY CAN'T. START. THANK YOU THE SOURCE IF YOU COULD WRAP IT UP. SURE I JUST WANNA WRAP THAT THEY THINK THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I REALLY AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE SELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY LET'S TURN TO OPPOSITION MISTER GREG BIRD IN OPPOSITION TO. AB. ONE ZERO EIGHT FOUR. SURE REMEMBERS MY NAME'S GREG BIRD WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND REMOVING THE BAN ON SEPARATING CHILDREN'S CLOTHES AND TOYS BY SEX AND NOW CHILDREN'S CLOTHES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BILL AS WELL SO THAT'S GOOD. BUT WE STILL OBJECT TO THE STATE DICTATING TO RETAIL STORES HOW TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMERS FIRST OFF THE BILL IS CONFUSING AND IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH THE BILL REQUIRES A RETAIL STORE TO CREATE A GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION OR A REASONABLE NUMBER OF EIGHT ITEMS ARE TO BE PLACED. BUT THE BILL DOES NOT THE FINAL WORD REASONABLE NOR DOES IT EXPLAIN WHAT ITEMS SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE JUNE GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION. IF A PARTICULAR ITEM IS INCLUDED. WON'T THAT GIVES SOME A CHILD OR ACTIVIST A REASON TO COMPLAIN WHO WILL RESOLVE THESE DISPUTES. NO STORE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO KNOW FOR SURE IF THEY'RE COMPLYING. A BILL LIKE THIS ALTHOUGH ALSO OPENS THE DOOR TO A NEVER. ENDING NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM ACTIVIST GROUPS WHO DON'T LIKE THE WAY STORES ARE MARKETING THEIR PRODUCTS TO ONE SEX OR ANOTHER. RETAIL STORES HAVE A RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO DECIDE HOW BEST TO MARKET THE PRODUCTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS BASED ON WHAT MARKET RESEARCH TELLS THEM THE CONSUMERS WANT. IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT THEY WILL GET IT WRONG SOMETIMES BUT WHEN THEY GET IT WRONG THAT PRODUCT WON'T SELL. THE MARKET MARKET WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF MEETING PUBLIC NEEDS AND THEN YOUR LAW WILL. A LITTLE MARKER SEE THAT PROTECTS THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION LIKE CARS. NO INDIVIDUAL OR LEGISLATOR HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL A COMPANY OWNER WHAT MESSAGES ABOUT GENDER THEY CAN USE TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. STATE LEGISLATORS NEED TO STOP FORCING THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS UPON THOSE THEY DISAGREE WITH. THIS IS THE ILLEGAL USE OF POWER. LEGISLATOR SHOULD RESPECT THE VIEWS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS INSTEAD OF USING THEIR LEGISLATIVE POWER TO FORCE THEIR VIEWS ON OTHERS. IT'S A VIOLATION OF FREE SPEECH BECAUSE IT'S COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT SPEECH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL STRONGLY OPPOSES AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR ENCOURAGES THIS COMMITTEE TO REJECT THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY LEND MONEY TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. BRINGING SOME OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE LOANS IN HOUSE WILL ALLOW US TO REDUCE FEES WE PAY TO EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. WHILE ALSO GIVING US MORE CONTROL OVER THE LOANS WE MAKE. WHEN MAKING THESE LOANS STAFF WE NEED TO ENSURE THE LOANS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICIES SET BY THE BOARD AND THE THIRTY DELEGATED TO THEM IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CALPERS BOARD IS FULLY BRIEFED ON INVESTMENT DEAL FLOW. BEGINNING TO END AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE INVESTMENT TEAM AS A TO DO SHOULD RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE BOARD. IF AN INVESTMENT IS PROBLEMATIC OR OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES. IT OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY. FOR THIS IS STRUCK IS NOT NEW. IT IS A MODELED AFTER THE PROTECTIONS ALREADY PROVIDED.

THEY WERE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE IT WAS ON PAGE NINE ABOUT THE AUTHOR ATTESTED TO ACCEPTING- IF THAT MIGHT ANSWER QUESTIONS. OKAY IT ON PAGE TEN IT SAYS THEY WERE PLEASED WITH THE OMIT AMENDMENTS BUT HE SAID IN HIS TESTIMONY THAT THEY HAD SO IT IF IN FACT THERE ARE MANY MYTHS THEY HAVE WOULD YOU CONSIDER THEM IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT. I MEAN COULD YOU REVIEW pWERE THESE CENTER THAT WAS ALL THE DISINGENUOUS STATEMENT BY MR SOROS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TELL YOU IT WAS DISINGENUOUS ON HIS PART. SO YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE OFFERED YOU ANY AMENDMENTS. THEY MAY HAVE OFFERED WAS A CALIPER THAT WE TAKE THEIR NAME AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS BACK AND FORTH BUT I MEAN THE WHOLE I'VE I'VE I'VE BEEN HERE SEVEN YEARS SENATOR AND JUST THE WHOLE INFLAMMATORY BILLIONAIRES THE BOOGEYMAN AND DISPLAYS STATEMENT ALONE- VERY INFLAMMATORY OUR GET THAT THAT'S INFLAMMATORY IF HE'S A CONSTITUENT AND I KNOW HIM OKAY AND- IF HE SAID THEY OFFER AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE HIM SO. LET'S JUST TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DISHES THEY'VE OFFERED. AMENDMENTS I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD LOOK AT THEM. EIGHT AND SIX SECOND WORRY- THERE WAS TESTIMONY AGAINST AND THERE IS IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS FROM VERY VERY S- CLIMATE ACTIVISTS PHILOSOPHY CALIFORNIA AND THERE WASTHE- THE THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY AND YET WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS IT DOESN'T TELL ME WHY- ADVOCATES IN CLIMATE WOULD OPPOSE THE BILL DO YOU KNOW COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT AT ALL. I'M NOT SURE THE RATIONALE IS HERE WITH HER THINKING IS. THEN THE MAIN ISSUE I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT. IS THAT WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE BE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN PERS. THAT IF THERE'S NOT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THESE LOANS OR THE TRANSACTIONS WHICH- MAY WELL BE TOTALLY APPROPRIATE- THAT PRIVATELY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PURSE WOULD HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND BE ABLE TO BE ON TOP OF THIS AND IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WASN'T RIGHT. IT WOULD. ARE THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ELECTED BOARD MEMBERS OF HERS. BANNON ASKING PERSON AT THAT HEARING I COULDN'T GET A CLEAR ANSWER IN THE LETTER- THAT CAME SUBSEQUENTLY. TALKS ABOUT THEIR PROCESS FOR DAT IN LOTS OF OTHER THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ADDRESS THAT CLEARLY AND THEN SOMEBODY SENT ME- SOMEBODY SENT ME A STATEMENT THAT SAYS ALL INVESTMENT DOCUMENTS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE BOARD PRIOR TO AND AFTER UNDERWRITING IF THE STAFF BELIEVES THERE'S ANY PROBLEM WITH AN EXISTING OR PENDING INVESTMENT THAT IS FRAUDULENT DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS ARE POTENTIAL DEFAULT STAFF IS REQUIRED TO INFORM THE BOARD OF ANY CONCERNS AND ANY BOARD MEMBER CAN REQUEST ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THIS IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT STILL ON THE LINE FROM PURSE THEY COULD SAY WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T COME CLEARLY FROM THE LOBBYIST AND IT DIDN'T- GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS PERSON IT DIDN'T COME CLEARLY IN THE LETTER BUT IT COMES CLEARLY IN THAT STATEMENT IS THAT STATEMENT TRUE. THROUGH THE CHAIR. SENATOR MISTER BROWN ZERO LIKE TO HAVE AN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THE CARD IS THE MIKE BACK ON ARE THERE WE GO- MISTER BROWN YOU WOULD YOU- CARROT DANCER THAT. THE MIKE'S NOT ON THERE HI THERE. YEAH GOING ON NOW OKAY- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SENATOR LAYERED AND I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO CLEARLY- ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THE FIRST TIME- WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT FOR THE MOST PART THAT IS TRUE BUT I WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT ALL DOCUMENTS ARE PROVIDED. YOU KNOW TO THE BOARD OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF DOCUMENTS THAT STUFF LOOKS LOOKS OUT BUT ULTIMATELY THE BOARD AS FIDUCIARIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL INVESTMENT DECISIONS THEN THEY SET THE POLICIES AND DELEGATE. AUTHORITY TO STAFF TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS BUT THE STAFF MUST KEEP THE BOARD INFORMED OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'RE MAKING WHILE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THEY ARE KEPT INFORMED THEIR PROVIDED INFORMATION AS THE BILL'S GOING AS OF PROPOSALS GOING THROUGH DUE DILIGENCE ONCE A PROPOSAL IS- FINALIZED UNDER THEIR BOARD DELEGATED AUTHORITY AT ANY ANY TIME SOMETHING FALLS OUT OF THE- OUT OF THE- IS. OUT OF THE BOARD POLICY OR DELEGATED AUTHORITY THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BRING THAT TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE GOING TO BRING ANY OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE WITH THAT. ENTITY THAT MAY IMPACT THE INVESTMENT TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION THEN THEN MAYBE I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION OF THE LAST HEARING. AND THAT QUESTION WAS BASICALLY- IF THE BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING FEES OR HAS THE ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DID THEY KNOW. ONE ONE OF THE POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS IS FLAWED BECAUSE THE ANSWER THAT THREW US OFF IN THE LAST HEARING WAS. THEY COULD REQUEST PAPERS OR BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS ABOUT ANY TRANSACTION BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO KNOW THAT THAT TRANSACTION IS FLAWED OR THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND WHEN I WAS TRYING TO GET AT. IS HOW WAS THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY HOW DO THEY KNOW WITHOUT THEM HAVING TO GUESS WHERE THERE'S A PROBLEM. IN A WAY THAT THERE'S TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY BY KEEPING THIS PRIVATE. BUT HAVING A PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANNA. ANNA OKAY AND THE REASON I GO BACK TO THAT QUESTION IS I'M NOT SURE YOU JUST AGREED TO THE STATEMENT THAT I READ TO YOU THAT ONE OF THE ADVOCATES GAVE TO ME. THAT ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE SO LET'S GO BACK TO THAT. SO HOW DO WE KNOW THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE BOARD IN THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN YOUR UNIT ADDRESSING THAT TO MISTER BROWN OR YES ANDREW THE CHAIR TO MISTER BROWN SORRY WE WERE HAVING A DIALOGUE SO- SURE- SO THE- STAFF. BRINGS THOSE TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION THE BOARD REQUIRES CERTAIN INFORMATION TO COME TO THE BOARD- FOR THESE INVESTMENTS SO THOSE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION FROM FROM STAFF THEY COULD ALSO BE BROUGHT TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION. THROUGH THEIR- INDEPENDENT. CONSULTANT THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT TO OVERSEE THE INVESTMENTS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY MAY PICK UP SOMETHING THEMSELVES FOR A STAKEHOLDER. NEWSPAPER OR SOMETHING COMES TO THEIR ATTENTION THEY MAY I STAFF THOSE SO. I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF AVENUES BUT ULTIMATELY. I THINK IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INVESTMENT TEAM TO- FIGURE THOSE THINGS OUT AND BRING THOSE TO THE BOARD'S ATTENTION SO THEY'RE AWARE OF THE- WEAR OF THEM THEYCAN GIVE THEM EXTRA SCRUTINY. IF THEY NEED TO. THEN. OKAY THEN LET ME DRIVE THIS IS A THIRD WAY IF IT'S OKAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. BOMB. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING DOESN'T GO ON FOR A WHILE BEFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE BOARD R. I MEAN WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE A LEAP HERE AND I THINK IN EXCHANGE FOR TAKING AWAY WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND ABILITY TO GET ON A PROBLEM IN SHORT ORDER. I MEAN THE- WELL THE WAY TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE C. SPEAKER HER THE MIKE- I MEAN THE BOARD. IS THE FIDUCIARY SO THEY HAVE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL INVESTMENTS AND THEN THE STAFF ALSO HAS A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MAKING. INVESTMENTS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR OF OUR- RECIPIENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE LEGAL ISSUES THAT THEY DON'T DO THAT THEY CAN GET SUED THERE'S- YOU KNOW STIRS- STAKEHOLDERS WILL BRING IT TO YOU KNOW BRING. THIS UP TO THEM I MEAN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY- THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVERSIGHT IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING SO RIGHT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO PUT IN PLACE THE SAFEGUARDS SO THAT THE STAFF KNOWS WHEN TO BRING THINGS TO THEIR ATTENTION AND STAFF HAS THE EXPERTISE TO KNOW WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PARTICULAR INVESTMENT. THAT CONCLUDES YOUR INQUIRY YES IT DOES I. I STILL FEEL AMBIVALENT. BUT I APPRECIATE THE EXCHANGE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO YET THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE. OF THE COMMITTEE BEEN A LONG HERE I ALWAYS PROMOTE- DIALOGUE AND EXCHANGE. NOW MOVING ON TO OUR OUR FEARLESS CHAIRMAN I DO BELIEVE HE WANTED TO PARTICIPATE. WELL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT CHAIRMANSHIP THERE I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU AS THE CHAIR HERE UNTIL WE FINISH THIS BILL- AND I MISSED SOME OF THE COLLOQUY. BUT FOLLOWING ON TO WHAT I THINK CENTER LAYERED WAS TALKING ABOUT- IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY- AND I KNOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOPER YOU WHAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BILL WE SPENT SOME TIME. TRYING TO CONTINUE THAT QUEST FOR ADEQUATE TRANSPARENCY AND STILL FULFILLING THE GOAL WHICH IS- MAKING SURE THAT IN A- WAY THAT THE TAXPAYERS CAN BE PROUD OF. THAT THAT WE MAXIMIZE PROFIT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I RECALL YOU YOU'RE CONTINUING COMMITMENT. TO WORK ON THIS TO TRY TO MEET BOTH OF THOSE GOALS- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY- YOU'VE ADDED A SUNSET WE'VE ADDED A SUNSET AND ALSO. A PROVISION THAT UP PROVIDED FOR THE TRANSPARENCY AS TO THE CONSTITUENT OWNERS. BUT I TRUST YOU WILL CONTINUE THAT QUEST. TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. YES YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT RIGHT RT THANK YOU BACK TO YOU MR THANK YOU I JUST HAVE A CUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR MAYBE MISTER BROWN- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION OF A 7% RETURN- THAT HAS NOW I THINK DROPPED AROUND. MAYBE SIX POINT EIGHT BUT IN REAL TERMS IT'S AROUND SIX DOES THAT SOUND ACCURATE. THEREABOUTS. SO IT DID GO DOWN TO SIX POINT EIGHT DUE TO A RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY AS A RESULT OF OUR RECENT- RETURN RETURNS IN THE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT CYCLE NOW ALSO THAT DECISION IS NOT GOING TO BE MADE TO LATER THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR AS TO WHETHER THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL GO DOWN EITHER EVEN FURTHER IT'S REALLY A POOR DECISION AND SO WE'RE JUST GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GO DOWN FURTHER THAN SIX POINT EIGHT. OKAY AND- IF THERE IS IF THERE IS A LOSS- WHAT IS THE STATE'S ROLE. AT SOME POINT IF THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL LOSS. OF THE STATE IS EXPECTED TO STEP IN AND MAKE A CONTRIBUTION IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. IT IS ACCURATE FOR THE STATE PLANS BUT NOT FOR THE OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT CONTRACT WITH US THE SCHOOLS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT THE STATE HAS FIVE PLANTS IS SO TO THE EXTENT WE DON'T HIT OUR- RATE OF RETURN. THE CONTRIBUTION RATES WILL GO UP FOR THE STATE GOT IT GOT IT. I THINK THERE'S SOME STRONG ARGUMENTS BACK AND FORTH ON THIS CALPERS WANTING TO- PURSUE MORE- RISKY BUT- LUCRATIVE- INVESTMENTS. ARE TO DRIVE UP ON THE PRTFOLIO AND THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE THE PUBLIC- EXPECTATION OF ACCESS GIVEN IT BEING A PUBLIC. SEMI PUBLIC ENTITY. BUT THIS IS BECAUSE IT'S NOW MOVING INTO THE- THE VENTURE CAPITAL THE INVESTMENT WORLD THROUGH THIS PROCESS- THERE'S A BIT OF A RUB ON. KEEPING INFORMATION- EXAM FROM THE TRADITIONAL- ACCESS POINTS FROM THE PUBLIC- SO I THINK. I IS THERE NOT A- HYBRID WHERE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL PROTOCOLS OF- PUBLIC INFORMATION ACT- OR FOR YOU WELL THAT'S ACTUALLY FEDERAL BUT- PUBLIC INFORMATION ALL RESPONSES THAT. COULD GET MORE INFORMATION IF THERE WAS MORE DUE DILIGENCE IN INQUIRY BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC BEYOND THE- THE NAMES AND PRINCIPLES AND- OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU AGREE TO THROUGH COMMITTEE- AMENDMENTS. I THINK THIS RAP RECORD CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THE RIGHT NOW THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOLKS DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION. A CONCERT YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE I'M- SORRY I MISSED YOU CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT FLOWS WITH SET UP RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION. THE PRIVATE BROKERS AND I THINK MISTER BROWN CAN VERIFY THAT. IS THAT IS AN ACCURATE SIR I'M SORRY I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER THAT. WHEN CALPERS MOVES THROUGH A THIRD PARTY BROKER FOR THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS. IT THEN. GOES OUTSIDE OF THE- PUBLIC DISCLOSURE- OBLIGATIONS THAT CORRECT- THAT IS CORRECT THE ONLY THING THAT GETS REPORTED OUT IS. YOU KNOW THE PRIVATE FUND WE EAT THE EXTERNAL MANAGER USE AND- RETURN INFORMATION AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL BUT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL. LOANS OR INVESTMENTS. GOT IT GOT IT ALL RIGHT THAT'S HELPFUL. ALL RIGHT- THING NO OTHER MIKES. OFF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE UP RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS BILL AND BY THE WAY I AM PRESENTING FIRST EVEY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT- THIS CALL IS INTENDED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONSISTENTLY HAD TO FIGHT FOR EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SPACES AND BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS FOR SAFETY AND INDEPENDENCE. RATES AVAILABLE TO THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES AB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT WOULD PREVENT THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS AND THEIR EQUIPMENT AS BEING MISREPRESENTED AS TO HAVE THE SAME RATES AS A GUIDE SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG AND IT WILL REQUIRE THE SALE OF EMOTIONAL UPPORT ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY A WRITTEN NOTICE. THE BILL WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT A HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONER PROVIDING DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEED. FOR AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOG THAT IS NOT A GUIDE SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOG AS DEFINED. UNLESS THE HEALTHCARE. ACTIVATION COMPLIES WITH SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS MEMBERS THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM AN NPR STORY THAT I HEARD LASTYEAR. THAT HAD A FAMILY TALKING ABOUT HAVING ADOPTED WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A TRAINED ANIMAL AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL FOR THEIR ARTISTIC SON. ONLY TO HAVE THAT ANIMAL TURN AROUND AND KILLED THEIR OTHER PETS IN FRONT OF THIS CHILD NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SOLD THEM THIS ANIMAL FOR A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD ADOPTED THE WEEK BEFORE FROM THE ANIMAL SHELTER. THAT IS BECAUSE UNDER THE LAW THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL THERE'S NO TRAINING FOR AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL THAT'S REQUIRED. LIKE I LIKE SERVICE DOGS AND SERVICE ANIMALS BUT THE PUBLIC. IS VERY CONFUSED BY THESE TERMS AND THAT'S WHY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE PREYING ON THIS VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION AND IF YOU DON'T MIND MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO TRY TO HOLD UP A COUPLE OF ILLUSTRATIONS. THAT WERE RESTAURANTS AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ALLOW SERVICE DOGS IN THEMSELVES ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT A SERVICE DOG IS AND WHO'S SUPPOSED TO BE ALLOWED INTO THEIR ESTABLISHMENT. THIS WAS A SIGN THAT MY STOPS ON FRONT OF TRADER JOE'S THAT SAYS NO PETS ALLOWED. SERVICE ANIMALS SPECIFICALLY TRAINED. TO HELP SOME OF THE DISABILITY ARE ALLOWED NOW. THIS IS A SERVICE ANIMAL CALLER THAT TELLS A RESTAURANT OR ESTABLISHMENT THAT THAT ANIMAL IS A TRAINED SERVICE DOG ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN GO AND BUY THIS CALLER THAT IS MEANT TO LOOK PRETTY MUCH IDENTICAL TO THE SERVICE DOG COLLAR BUT IT SAYS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL. THIS PET IT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE SOME OF MY WITNESSES ARE GOING TO TESTIFY HAVE ATTACKED HUMANS- THEY'VE BEEN ATTACKS ON OTHER SIR ON SERVICE ANIMALS AND REALLY LEADING TO PEOPLE WHO NEED SERVICE ANIMALS TO FEEL AFRAID TO BRING THEIR ANIMALS INTO THESE ESTABLISHMENTS. NOW- THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO CURTAIL THAT MISINFORMATION AND TO HELP TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE FRAUDULENT SALE OF CERTIFICATIONS THAT IMPLIED TO PEOPLE THAT THEIR PET WILL NOW HAVE THE SAME ACCESS RATES AS A SERVICE DOG THIS BILL IS RECEIVED WIDE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BNP COMMITTEES AND ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WITH NO NO VOTES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS EVENING IT SAYS MORNING BLITZ EVENING AS WELL AS CROSSMAN FROM CANINE COMPANIONS AND RABBIT OUT FROM GUIDE DOGS FOR THE BLIND I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL.

HE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE DOG BUT AFTER TEN INSTANCES IN PLACES WHERE PETS DOGS AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ARE NOT PERMITTED. HE COULD NO LONGER WORK EVEN IN MY HOME. HE WAS HE WAS A GREAT. OF MY RETIRED SERVICE DOG WHO WAS CAUSING HIM STRESS JUST BY YOUR PRESENCE BEING THERE I RETIRED MY SERVICE DOG WORK AT AGE FOUR AND I LOST MY INDEPENDENCE IT TOOK ME YEARS AND IT'S STILL WORK IN PROGRESS TO MAKE TO NOT HAVE A DRAMATIC RESPONSE TO DOGS THE PLACES FOR PET DOGS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT DOGS ARE NOT PERMITTED. THE CONFUSION AROUND ACCESS RATES DUE TO FRAUDULENT AND MISLEADING BUSINESS PRACTICES IF NOT VICTIMLESS ITS IMPACT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO TRULY RELY ON SERVICE DOGS TO LEAD INDEPENDENT LIVES I AM RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FOUR SIX EIGHT.

SIR LAYERED MOUSSE ALL RIGHT SETTLER LAYERED MOVES- AB FOUR SIX EIGHTY K. TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES WAS VERY LATE TO OPPOSITION. I WILL SAY THAT. THE THE HAVING AN . AN ESA DOES ALLOW IF IT'S WRITTEN ANYBODY CAN BUY A PET TOO YOU KNOW THE SUPPORT THEMSELVES HAVING THE ESSAY GIVES YOU A CERTAIN PRIVILEGE WHEN IT COMES TO FOR INSTANCE BEING ABLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT WITH THE DOG WHEN YOU MIGHT OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT A THERAPIST ACTUALLY EVALUATE PEOPL FOR THAT NEED. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT IS PEOPLE JUST LITERALLY CALL A THERAPIST ON THE PHONE. AND SAY YOU NEED THIS AND THEN THEY SEND THEM THE PRESCRIPTION HAVING A DOLL- TO MARSHAL SUPPORT ANIMALS TO BE PART OF AN ONGOING THERAPY IS NOT A PILL THAT YOU TAKE WHEN YOU GET IT AND ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE- YOUR STRESS OR WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS CURED. ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THE PERSON WHO GETS THE ESA HAS AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT THERAPIST THAT THEY ARE NOT JUST LITERALLY. PHONING SOMEONE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE OFFERING A SERVICE ON THE INTERNET JUST TO GIVE ANYBODY A CERTIFICATE THAT'S ALL THAT WE'RE REQUIRING AND WE THINK THAT WE CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH THE BOARD I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. ALL RIGHT THE MAN CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU'D CALL THE ROLL. I YES THIS IS EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR LAYERED THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG. HI AM BERG I BURGESS. ABIERTO COVER. I DID ASK.

SO REMEMBER FREEMAN AT TEN TWENTY FLOORS YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE BILLS TAKE COLDER FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. AS YOUR ANALYSIS NOTES WE HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE MAIN THE MAIN STAKEHOLDER THAT WAS STILL IN OPPOSITION WHICH WITH THE DEBT BUYERS ON AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE CONTRACTING WITH THOSE DEBT BUYERS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE POLICY COMMITTEE'S DEADLINE WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS BEFORE THE BILL WAS HEARD IN APPROPRIATIONS. MEDICAL DEBT IS A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER PER BANKRUPTCY POVERTY AND RACIAL INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A KEY REFORMS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AT RISK BUT THE HOSPITAL PEER PRICING ACT AND THE FAIR DEBT CUT DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT WERE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN DEBT COLLECTION. AND INCREASED PATIENT AWARENESS OF FREE AND DISCOUNTED MEDICAL CARE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MUST PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES AND ARE UNINSURED OR UNDER INSURED THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CAN IT. CAN BE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNTS OF THEIR BILLS OR PAYMENT PLANS OR BOTH. NOW THE HOSPITALS MUST FOLLOW THIS A DEBT COLLECTORS ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES- AND THERE ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS WITH A COLLECTION PRICE A PREP PROCESS SUCH AS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAY TIME PERIOD. BEFORE THEY CAN REPORT A PATIENT ACCOUNT TO A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY OR COMMENCE OF ALL ACTION AGAINST THE PATIENT. AND ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE PATIENTS TO APPLY FOR THE KERR FOR WHICH THEY COULD BE ENTITLED. HOWEVER DESPITE THOSE PROTECTIONS PATIENTS ARE STILL NOT BENEFITING FROM THE LAW KAISER HEALTH NEWS REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT NON HA HA A PROFIT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA COULD HAVE. BUT DID NOT PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS PATIENTS INSTEAD OF REPORT BEING DISCHARGED AND RECEIVING MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL OR COULD HAVE APPLIED FOR A CHARITY CARE. WORSE THOSE HOSPITALS OFTEN SELL PATIENT ACCOUNTS TO COLLECTION AGENCIES WHICH THEN ALSO FURTHER NEGLECT TO INFORM PATIENTS BUT THEY COULD APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. CONSEQUENTLY THESE PATIENTS FACE NEGATIVE CREDIT REPORTING AND FINALLY COLLECTIONS LAWSUITS RIGHT AT THE TIME WHEN THEY'RE MOST VULNERABLE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SICK OR ILL. TO ADDRESS THE GAPS IN EXISTING LAW AND STRENGTHENS PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND OUR RESIDENTS. AB TEN TWENTY WILL STRENGTHEN STATE ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT OF A HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT BY PENALIZING HOSPITALS THAT DON'T COMPLY. PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BILLS AND HOW TO APPLY FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICAL. AS WELL AS CHARITY CARE AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE AND ALSO WHEN THE BILL IS SENT TO COLLECTIONS. EXTENDED VERSE CREDIT REPORTING AND COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL ACTIONS FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. AND REQUIRE DEBT COLLECTORS AND DEBT BUYERS TO CERTIFY THAT THE PATIENT HASBEEN SCREENED FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE FILING A LAWSUIT. IT ALSO RAISES THE INCOME LEVEL FOR FINANCIAL% ASSISTANCE FROM THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT. OF THE POVERTY LEVEL 24100% MEMBERS MEDICAL DEBT IS AN OBSCENITY THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE IN CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN WITH AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD BE OFFERING THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER THE LAW TO THESE PATIENTS TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON OR TRACY DOUGLAS WITH. THAT SET UP LEGAL SERVICES. AND MOTOHARU SUPERMARKET FROM THE PUBLIC LAW CENTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOU IN MY CORRECT THERE'S NO LONGER ANY OPPOSITION THE BILL. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S NO LONGER ANY OPPOSITION THAT THAT WE ARE AWARE OF ALL RIGHT- TRACY DOUGLAS AND MANOHAR. SUPERMARKET. THE FLOOR IS YOURS TO TESTIFY ON THE BILL WITHOUT OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING SURE AMBER AGAIN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY MY NAME IS MARISSA KUMAR AND I'M THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY FOR THE HELP ALL UNITS. OF PUBLIC LAW CENTER A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM THAT PROVIDES FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO LOW INCOME ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS. OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF MEDICAL BILLING ISSUES BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY DISTURBING WHEN DEALING WITH HOSPITAL BILLS. FOR LOW INCOME UNINSURED OR UNDER INSURED CLIENT NEVER OFFERED. THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE. CASE IN POINT IS MONIQUE DAVIS- CLIMATE TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY FOR THE BELL WHEN YOU PUT IN THE PRIMER OR LIFE. WHEN IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO DEVELOP AN EXCEEDINGLY RARE BONE MARROW DISORDER. DEADLY SICK FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF MONEY WOULD BE RUSHED TO THE ER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND ADMITTED FOR A WEEK OR MORE AT OVER FIVE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS. EACH VISIT COMPOUNDING HER MEDICAL DEBT. MONEY CANNOT WORK AND HER HUSBAND HAD TO MISS WORK TO CARE FOR HER. WHILE AT AN ORANGE COUNTY HOSPITAL EVEN TOLD HER HUSBAND TO BORROW MONEY FROM FAMILY MEMBERS. TO PAY OUT OF POCKET BEFORE THEY WOULD CONTINUE HER TREATMENT. NONE OF THE HOSPITALS IN FOR MONIQUE ABOUT POTENTIAL FINANCIAL HELP. WHEN YOU START TO RECEIVE NUMEROUS BILLS IN THE MAIL AND HOSPITALS WILL CALL MONIQUE'S HUSBAND DEMANDING PAYMENT. MONIQUE AND HER HUSBAND WERE SCARED FELT ALONE AND TERRIFIED AT TIMES MANY THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER HAD SHE DIED BELIEVING HER HUSBAND OF THE STRESS AND FINANCIAL BURDEN. THE BUILDING MOUNTED IN THE CALLS INCREASED. WHEN IT WAS TURNED OVER TO COLLECTION AGENCIES- CREDIT WAS RUINED BUT NOT UNTIL MANY CONTACTED PUBLIC LAW CENTER. THAT SHE LEARNED SHE SHOULD'VE GONE HELP FROM THE HOSPITAL TO REDUCE REDUCE OUR BILL. AND SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN. THAT SAID PATIENTS SHOULD NOT NEED A LAWYER TO BE OFFERED THE FINANCIAL IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. PUT YOURSELF IN OUR CLIENTS SHOES IMAGINE GETTING SICK OR INJURED THEN ADDING INSULT TO INJURY WITH UNAFFORDABLE MEDICAL BILLS AB TEN TWENTY IS CRITICAL TO ADDING FURTHER CHARITY CARE PROTECTIONS ENSURING THAT WE'RE TREATING OUR FELLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WITH HUMANITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO I MEAN THANK YOU HONOURABLE MEMBERS BUT SENATE GIVEN NONPROFIT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION AND WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AT TEN TWENTY. MY WORK ROUTINE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT WE KNOW HARD DESCRIBES AS A PRETTY CLEAR CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ARE NOT PROVIDING CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY COULD AND ARE ALSO NT TELLING PATIENTS ABOUT IT SHOULD BE A BILITY. MEDICAL DEBT HAS DEVASTATING ATTACKS CONTINUE PEOPLE INTO POVERTY THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR HOUSING THEIR AFFECTION FOR CLOSURE THE STRETCH FROM DEBT PILING UP A COLLECTION CALLED HORSE WITH THEIR HEALTH. WHERE'S THE NEEDY FORCED TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY MEDICAL DEBT IS THE LEADING. CAUSE OF CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY. MAYBE TEN TWENTY PROVIDE CONSUMERS. FOR PATIENTS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS IT INCREASES ELIGIBILITY 24100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE IT ADDS STATE OVERSIGHT I HATE HOSPITAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. HOW DOES THE NEW CHOIR TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTORS AND BUYERS TO PATIENTS. REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS AND ADMIRERS TO SHOW THAT THE PATIENT HASN'T SCREEN FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN FILING A LAWSUIT. REALLY HOSPITAL DEBT BUYERS TO ENSURE THAT DATA CAN BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO HOSPITALS WHEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASSISTANT THERE IS NO INTEREST CHARGE FROM HOSPITAL. THAT MY CLIENTS EFFICIENT BUILDER SENIOR SHOULD MERGE INTO CARE NEEDED SURGERY FOR CONDITIONS AT NO TIME DID THE HOSPITAL NEVER LET THEM KNOW ABOUT CHARITY CARE THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE REFERRED TO LEGAL AID FOR HELP. ISSUES SHOULD NOT BE AN ATTORNEY TO TELL THEM ABOUT. FINANCIAL OPTION. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PAGAN HARD TO GET SHOULD BE GRANTED READILY AVAILABLE. I THINK IT'S NOT THE ONLY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION OR ANYTHING PROBLEM MY COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER LEGAL SERVICES OR FOURTEEN I THINK ISSUES. I AM CALM STRENGTH IN THE HOSPITAL FOR PRICING ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY. BENEFIT FROM AN AD INTENDED. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU-MR CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TEN OH SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WILL RIGHTFULLY COMPENSATE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY WOMEN WHO WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUS. AND EGREGIOUS EUGENICS LAWSON THEREAFTER BY CREATING THE FORCED STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM EUGENICS PRACTICES HAVE A LONG SHAMEFUL HISTORY IN OUR COUNTRY INCLUDING INVOLUNTARY AND FORCED STERILIZATIONS. BETWEEN NINETEEN OH NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE STERILIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S EUGENICS LAWS MAKING IT UP MAKING UP ONE THIRD OF STERILIZATIONS NATIONWIDE. ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING CASES OF FORCED AN UNKNOWN STERILIZATION HAPPENED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND EARLY COUNTY HOSPITAL IN DISTRICT. WHICH I AM PROUD TO REPRESENT IN WHICH MEXICAN AMERICAN AND MEXICAN WOMEN AND IMMIGRANT LATINO WOMEN WERE STERILIZED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT POST LABOR. THESE WOMEN THESE WOMEN NEVER KNEW WHY THEY CAN NEVER HAVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN THE PAIN CONFUSION ANGER DEPRESSION. AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THESE WOMEN FACE IS DOCUMENTED IN THE FILM NO MY HUSBAND IS NO MORE BABIES. THESE WOMEN ARE NOW ELDERLY. AND LEAVING OUR WORLD EVERY DAY. ALTHOUGH THIS HORRIFIC LAW WAS REPEALED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. A LATER STATE AUDIT REVEALED A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR WOMEN WERE STERILIZED DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY WITHOUT PROPER CONSENT WHILE INCARCERATED FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX. TO TWO THOUSAND TEN. IT WASN'T SO LONG AGO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. DATING TO THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED WOMEN WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED IN PRISON DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF FOUR STERILIZATIONS WERE PERFORMED. DURING OTHER SURGERIES. IT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED THERE ARE ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS STERILIZED UNDER THE LAW. IN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SURVIVORS OF PRISON STERILIZATION ABUSE. THESE ABUSES ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN THE FILM. BELLY OF THE BEAST. INVOLUNTARY FOR STERILIZATION HAS HISTORICALLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED INCARCERATED WOMEN OF COLOR WITH 65% OF SURVIVORS IDENTIFY AS BLACK. LATINO MEXICAN OR OTHER. IT IS SHAMEFUL TO KNOW THAT EVEN TO THIS DAY MANY MANY SURVIVORS STILL DO NOT KNOW. THAT THE REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY WAS VIOLENTLY STOLEN FROM THEM. FORCED AN INVALID INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION HAS IMPACTED MORE THAN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN SOME CASES THERE WERE EXTREME SIDE EFFECTS LIFELONG HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. SOCIAL ISOLATION. AND EVEN DEATH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE FORCED STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS MORE THAN MONETARY COMPENSATION IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR OUTREACH IDENTIFICATION AN APPEALS PROCESS AND PAYMENT. REPARATIONS MOST IMPORTANTLY IT OFFERS A SEMBLANCE OF JUSTICE BY CONFRONTING CALIFORNIA'S SHAMEFUL PAST. AB TUNNEL SEVEN WILL PROVIDE SOME CLOSURES TO THOSE HARMED UNDER GOVERNMENT SPONSORED STERILIZATION PRACTICES AND ENSURE THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN HEALING COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND ENDING THE PERPETRATION OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INEQUALITIES. THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO BE A PARENT TO BE A MOTHER AND TO BE A FATHER. AND NO AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION WILL EVER MAKE THAT RIGHT BUT THIS IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS JUSTICE. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BI PARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT I HAVE CARRIED THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO SERVE AND THE DECADES LONG PROCESS. THAT THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION HAS TAKEN FROM THE REPEAL OF NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE TO THE APOLOGY IN THE IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS BY GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS TO THIS MOMENT WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN. TO GOD WILLING TO MOVE IT FORWARD ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE THE WOMEN WHOSE RIGHTS TO BECOME PARENTS AND MOTHERS WERE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. I THANK YOU. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE.

IF THIS BECOMES LAW WE WILL BE THE THIRD STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO BE ABLE TO OFFER REPARATIONS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO OFFER REPARATIONS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLYINCARCERATED. AS MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID THE ARC OF THE MORAL UNIVERSE IS LONG BUT IT DOES INDEED BEND TOWARD JUSTICE AND WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FIGHT FOR DECADES.

MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT TO SIMPLY BILL EIGHT EIGHT NINE WHICH SEEKS TO REQUIRE ALL CORPORATE LANDLORDS WHO HAVE A REPORT TO THE CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S. THIS SIMPLE REQUIREMENT LOL REQUIRES LLC'S TO REPORT INFORMATION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. THAT THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO COLLECT BUT LLC'S FAILED TO SUBMIT. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS THAT WORKING FAMILIES IN MY DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE BEING DEPRIVED BEING DEPRIVED OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. THERE IS AN ALARMING THERE IS AN ALARMING INCREASE OF CORPORATE LANDLORDS PURCHASING HOMES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR NAMES ARE NEVER RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC. UNIDENTIFIED BUYERS HIDE BEHIND THEIR LLCS BUYING GENERATIONAL HOMES ACROSS THE STATE ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS OFTEN BIT HIGHER THAN CONVENTIONAL BUYERS. BUY A MONOPOLIZING THE MARKET THESE CORPORATE INVESTORS HAVE DRIVEN UP HOME VALUES AND HAVE CONTRIBUTE TO HOUSING THE HOUSING SHORTAGE OF NEARLY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES. THIS MAKES IT HARD FOR LOW INCOME AND MEDIUM- INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES TO PURCHASE A HOME AND BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH A. B. EIGHT EIGHT NINE WILL PROVIDE A NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY. TO KNOW WHO IS BEHIND THESE L. L. C.'S THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE CORPORATE LANDLORDS TO REPORT THE BENEFACTOR OWNERS OF THE CORPORATIONS OR- OR THE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES. OF RENTERS OUT OF THEIR OF PROPERTY JOINING ME HERE TO SET TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER. THEY WILL SELL PRODUCE. THANK YOU- FIRST UP. KATIE PARK ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW PROPERTY LAW AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER- THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME TODAY- BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY INFORMATION ABOUT WHO OWNS PROPERTY INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO THE TITLE REGISTRY IN AMERICA FOR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED YEARS- THIS TITLE REGISTRY HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF THE AMERICAN PROPERTY SYSTEM. AND IF MARKET IT'S A MAJOR INNOVATION FROM ENGLISH LAW THAT HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED AND ADOPTED ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR A BENEFIT TO THE MARKET AND SOCIETY WHICH INCLUDE PREVENTING FRAUD CORRUPTION DECREASING LITIGATION PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AS WELL AS THE COST OF LITIGATION. YOU ALWAYS KNEW WHO OWNS WHAT HOW TO FIND THEM THE LAWSUIT THE FEDERAL. ENERGY STILL AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION NURSES. MUCH LITIGATION OVER PROPERTY AS EVER. BUT THE RECENT USE OF LLC. TO PURCHASE PROPERTY HAS CHANGED A LONG STANDING STATUS QUO- THIS NEW PRACTICE- CHANGING THE STATUS QUO CENTURIES REALLY TOOK OFF IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES INTO THE TWO THOUSAND. THE LLC WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED TO PROVIDE A TAX BENEFIT NOT TO SHIELD IDENTITY THE PROPERTY OWNERS. IT HAS ACQUIRED THAT FUNCTION OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO AND IT ISN'T UNINTENDED AND UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION BUT THE USE OF LLC IS TO PURCHASE PROPERTY. HAVE GUARDED THE TITLE REGISTRY OF INFORMATION ABOUT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP. THERE WAS NO GOVERNMENTAL DESIGNED A PLAN THERE AND PREDICTABLY IT IS GIVING RISE TO ALL THE PROBLEM TITLE REGISTRY WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT. FRAUD MONEY LAUNDERING LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO NEIGHBORS TENANTS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IF THE PIECEMEAL ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BY STATE. HOW DO YOU- TO THE WEST COAST AND KEEP OF THESE EFFORTS IF THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ABOUT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP FROM WHERE- THIS IS NOT A COORDINATED EFFORT COLLECTION OF THIS INFORMATION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T FALL STATE YOUR CITY PROBLEM REALLY THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING MORE COMPREHENSIVE BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S EACH GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES FOR ITSELF. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP IS THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE OBTAINED IN LITIGATION ONE THERE ARE PROBLEMS THROUGH DISCOVERY. BUT WHAT THE ABSENCE OF A PUBLIC RECORD DOES IS PROFOUNDLY RAISE THE COST FOR OTHER PARTIES I'M TRYING TO SETTLE A DISPUTE. THE COST PREMEDICATION AND DURING LITIGATION THE SUSPECTS NEIGHBORS. AND CITY EXCUSE THE ADVANTAGES- OF LITIGATION IT COULD ENCOURAGE BAD BEHAVIOR IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR CITIES TO MAKE POLICY CHOICES ABOUT THEIR HOUSING MARKET. BY RAISING THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT. IT IS SIMPLY THE CASE THAT NATURAL PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PROPERTY INTEREST. ALWAYS HAS BEEN A NOMINALLY THEY STILL ARE EVEN IF THIS INFORMATION IS STRICTLY THE REGISTRY BUT NOT HAVING BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP IN THE PUBLIC RECORD MAKES IT MUCH HARDER FOR THAT SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO WORK. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. THANK YOU PROFESSOR NEXT WITNESS. HI ANGELA TRIP FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION AND TRANSPARENCY OF CORPORATE AND ARGUMENTS URGENT AND IMPORTANT MATTER TO US THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. IN MAY IT WAS REVEALED THAT PRIVATE EQUITY GIANT THE BLACKSTONE GROUP HAD PURCHASED SIX THOUSAND APARTMENT UNITS IN SAN DIEGO FOR NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WE WERE NOT SURPRISED AS A REPORT EARLIER IN THE YEAR SHOW THAT JOHN HAMMOND OF THE LARGEST CORPORATE LANDLORDS HAD AMASSED HUNDRED AND NINETY ONE BILLION CASH ON HAND DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WE'RE READY FOR A BUYING FRENZY. IN A HAD ALREADY STRESSED BY HOUSING UNAFFORDABILITY FURTHER CONSOLIDATION UNDER LARGE CORPORATE LANDLORDS. WILL UNDOUBTEDLY MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR TENANTS AND HOMEBUYERS HOWEVER NOT HAVING SPECIFIC DATA FOR CITIES COUNTIES AND ELECTORAL DISTRICT IS A BARRIER TO DESIGNING. AND MOVING POLICY THAT ADDRESSES ALL THESE HOUSING ISSUES EFFECTIVELY. LACK OF OWNER INFORMATION IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC AS YOU CONSIDER THAT THE STATE IS EXPECTING TO GRANT EIGHTY MILLION IN RENT- TO LANDLORDS. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITHOUT THAT THEY NEED HOWEVER WITHOUT EIGHTY EIGHT NINE RELATED TRANSPARENCY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE WILL NOT KNOW HOW MUCH WHAT AND BAILING OUT THE DESERVING MIGRANT POPULATION. FIRST OF BAILING OUT YOUR OLYMPIC STAR THAN BUILDING IN NEW. YORK SLUMLORDS LIKE VERITATIS. THE FACT THAT BIG COAL ARE DRIVING IS ALSO VISIBLE WATCH FIVE NUMBER OF WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED THIS YEAR. AS PART OF ONE OF THE MURDERS RELATED. WE ARE IMPACTING THE LENDING PROCESS AS A BANK IN CALIFORNIA WHOSE COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PROGRAM RELIES HEAVILY ON LANDING THE PERFECTLY TO LANDLORDS AND WORKING CLASS EITHER.

TRANSPARENCY BUT ONCE IT'S LIKE COUPLE YOU'LL BE DROPPED THE NAME BLACK ROCK- AND- TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF. THE AND AGAIN THE CORE KNOWLEDGE THIS WOULD NOT COVER PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES LIKE BLACKWATER.

IT'S UP TO THE LAST 1% AND FOR CORPORATE AND LIMIT LIABILITY COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE TO REGISTER- I'VE BEEN THIS BIG- CURRENTLY. MOSTLY TO PROPERTY OWNERS ARE ORGANIZED AS CORPORATIONS AND LLCS THE POINT OF THE LARGE COMPANIES AND IN CORPORATIONS EVEN MOM HOPS REGISTER AS CORPORATIONS AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. AND THIS BILL WILL TREAT THE LANDLORDS DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER SIMILAR BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE USING THE LLC INCORPORATION FALL.

GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CRIPPLING POPULAR WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION AND A LOT OF QUESTIONS THE BILL THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU. MY NUMBER SIX SIXTEEN. HI THERE BIANCA BLANC QUEST WITH SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY AND WE ARE ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ALREADY THANK YOU OTHERS. NO HELLO THANK YOU HERE IS FIVE OH SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. LITERATURE MEMBERS PAT MORAN WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ALREADY THANK YOU. MODERATOR ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANYONE IN Q. OKAY WELL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NOT SEEING ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUST A FEW QUESTIONS- WHILE I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. THE THRUST OF THE BILL IDENTIFYING PROPERTY OWNERS- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THOUGH THAT STILL EXIST ON THE BILL'S BEEN IN PRINT NOW FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS I BELIEVE IT IS. AND THIS IS OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY REVIEW THE BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE. SO WHILE I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF MAKING SURE THAT WE IDENTIFY THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERSHIP SOME QUESTIONS SO IT WAS IT WAS MENTIONED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHAT WOULD BLACKSTONE HAVE TO REVEAL. UNDER THIS BILL IN TERMS OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS. SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE HAVE OUR- THE INDIVIDUAL FROM- GEORGETOWN. TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT'S PROFESSOR PARK WHAT WOULD BLACKSTONE HAVE TO REVEAL. WHAT WOULD LASH DON'T HAVE TO REVEAL I MEAN ISN'T THAT BILL JUST 25% BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST I DON'T KNOW WHO BLACKS DON'T HAVE 25% BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST. SO BLACKSTONE WOULDN'T REVEAL ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT. I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE- THE INTEREST THAT BLACKSTONE TONOTE THAT SOMEBODY HAD 25% BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST OUT BLACKSTONE THEN THAT PERSON WOULD HAVE TO DISCLOSE WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE RIGHT HOWEVER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROPERTY INSURANCE. ANALYTICS AND MATTER OF LITIGATION OVER A PROPERTY INTEREST WOULD HAVE TO SHOW UP TO COURT WHOEVER THAT PERSON WOULD BE ULTIMATELY WOULD BE THE PERSON I WOULD HAVE TO REPORT. ALL RIGHT SO. TRUST. WHAT WOULD THAT BE FOR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS WOULD BE THE GENERAL MANAGER OF A PARTNER WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO. HAS AND THEN I'M GONNA ASK A SECOND WHAT WHAT A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IT IS OURS I'M SORRY SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. WHO WOULD SHOW UP FOR A MINUTE BUT- PETER COMPLICATED QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING DETERMINED BY COURTS OF LAW IT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS BUT THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT COURTS ARE DEALING WITH IT BECAUSE IT ARISES- BECAUSE- SUCH FIGURES AND ENTITIES. ARE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT FOR THEIR PROPERTY INTERESTS. ALL THE TIME THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE IT BEAT. TO BRING THEM INTO COURT IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION HERE BUT THEN WHAT WOULD THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BE. IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR ENSURING THAT- INSURING THAT THE INFORMATION REQUESTED IT ACTUALLY REPORTED IT BUT THE QUESTION SIR WELL FOR VIOLATION OF SHOULD THIS LAW BE ENACTED WHAT WITH THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM BE. IT WELL I THINK THAT THEY'RE WHATEVER- MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE REPORTING OF OTHER KINDS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE ALREADY BUSINESS ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED AND YOU KNOW- TO REGISTER AND PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION JUST NOT BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP WITH THE SIMPLY JUST ADDING ONE MORE LINE. TO AN EXISTING PRACTICE AN EXISTING KIND OF FORM- AND SO IT WOULD UPDATE REGULARLY ADDS FILING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE ARE SUPPOSED TO- REGULARLY BE UPDATED AND REFRESHED. BUT SO IF FOR EXAMPLE A CORPORATION- WITH. SAY TWENTY OWNERS OR TWENTY SHAREHOLDERS- THEY NEED ONLY LIST THE NAME OF THE CORPORATION ASSUMING EACH OF EQUAL SHARE IS THAT RIGHT. IT SOUNDS THAT WAY THE LAN I. PRESENTS BUDGETS BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- INTEREST HOLDING BENEFICIAL OWNERS. BUT IF MY WIFE AND I BOUGHT- FORMED AN LLC AND BOUGHT A UNIT THEN WE WOULD NEED TO NAME OUR INDIVIDUAL NAMES IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT I SEE. OKAY IN WHAT. I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL. IT SAYS UNIVERSITY. WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT I SEE THAT SOMEONE WHO RECEIVES SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS MUST ALSO BE LISTED AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER WHAT WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS. SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS AGAIN LIKE I SAID SOMETHING THAT BEING DETERMINED BY THE COURT I MEAN IT'S GING TO DIFFER A LITTLE BIT JERK DICTION TO JURISDICTION SO I WOULD HESITATE TO SAY EXACTLY. I'M NOT EVEN SURE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING YOU'RE THINKING OF RIGHT NOW- BYE YOU KNOW IT'S FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD RICH WRIST THE INCOME STREAM THAT IS SUBSTANTIAL RELIED YOU KNOW SOME QUANTITY THAT- IT'S SIZEABLE- IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS- BENEFIT FROM THE PROPERTY ITSELF FROM THE OWNERSHIP- THAT SORT OF THING THAT PROBABLY THE MOST OBVIOUS EXAMPLE. SO IF THIS LET'S ASSUME THIS IS A CIVIL VIOLATION. AND IF A JUDGE WOULD INSTRUCT THE JURY HOW WOULD THAT JUDGE HOW WOULD SHE INSTRUCTS THE JURY AS TO WHAT A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS. FOR PURPOSES OF ISOLATION ALONG. IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE JUST REFERRING TO CALIFORNIA LAW AT THIS POINT. I'M ACTUALLY IN WASHINGTON DC IF I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS ABOUT THIS BUT IT'S A FAIRLY INTUITIVE DEFINITION YOU KNOW IT'S A FAIRLY COMMONSENSICAL IDEA THAT IF SOMEONE GETS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INCOME- FROM. SOME KIND OF PROPERTY HOLDINGS- THAT THAT WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS- YOU KNOW I THINK. I DON'T KNOW TO TELL YOU WHAT IT REALLY COMMONSENSICAL IF YOU'RE ASKING EXACTLY WHERE THE LINE IS I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WILL DEPEND ON LOTS OF- OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CASE- BUT THE FAIRLY AGAIN INTUITIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD. FIVE OF- TYPE OF PROVISION SO WOULD THAT BE THE JURY INSTRUCTION THAT A JUDGE WOULD GIVE TO A JURY THAT YOU ARE TO JUST. ASSUME WHAT A SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFIT IS THAT WOULD BE THIS THAT WOULD BE THE DEFINITION FOR I HAVE. YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANY PARTICULAR DAY MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT JUDGES GIVE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF JURY JUDGE. THERE IS NO WAY TO GENERALIZE ABOUT SUCH A THING. BUT I SEE ALL RIGHT WELL I'M GONNA LET THAT GO ALL RIGHT SO- CENTER WHITE HOUSE GIVE A QUESTION. NO NO NO ALL RIGHT- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES SENATOR RUSSELL- YES I UNDERSTAND THERE WERE- CONCERNS RAISED RAISED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS ANOTHER AGENCY- BUT I'M JUST MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR IS THE- ISSUES OR CONCERNS RAISED BY RAISED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE- HAVE YOU OR WILL YOU CONTINUE TO BE WORKING TO- THE SATISFACTION OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE ISSUES THAT. THE SECRETARY HAS RAISED ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- AND ABSOLUTELY I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE TODAY- SHE'S PROVIDED AN ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH THIS WOULD COST IF IT MEANS UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEM- SHE THINK THAT SHE COULD ALSO GET- THE COST DOWN- BASED ON ANOTHER MATTER. AND SO WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TALKING ABOUT IT I JUST BLEW THIS UP FOR YOU HAD OCCASION WE TALK THIS IS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT D. BEING REMOVED WHERE IT SAYS- LIST ADDITIONAL MANAGERS OR MEMBERS AND WE JUST WANT INCLUDE BENEFACTOR OWNER. THERE AND THAT'S THE FORM THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED- PEOPLE ALREADY WITH A FILE LOC THAT INFORMATION IS SENT TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ALREADY BY LAW AND WE'RE WE'RE- ATTEMPTING TO DO IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IT'S JUST LIKE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WHO OWNS PROPERTY. YOUR INFORMATION IS MADE PUBLIC PEOPLE CAN FIND OUT WHO OWNS THIRTEEN FOURTEEN MARKING BARREL LANE WELL WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO L. L. C. NO ONE KNOWS AND WE WANT TO- IT THROUGH THIS BILL TO CREATE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHO IS BEHIND THE L. L. C. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FORM WILL MODIFY. AND SO MY COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE- SECRETARY OF STATE AS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE- IN THIS REGARD THAT IS WHAT ASK THE DEBT IS BODY ALLOW THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE CAN GET. I WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER IN ORDER TO GET- THIS BO- ON THE FLOOR AND PASSED. THANK YOU FOR THE SUMMER GIVES IT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT WHAT'S THE SECTOR STATES POSITION ON THE BILL THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS NO POSITION AVAILABLE ALL RIGHT AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER ALL RIGHT- ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS. ANYTHING. FOR THE MOTION. I'M SORRY. SENATOR ALSO MOVES THE BILL ALL RIGHT MAN CHIEF COUNSEL PLEASE BOTH WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I WANT TO JUST APPRECIATE THE CHAIR WHEN WE ASK THE QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY TO MY UNDERSTANDING MY- HE BEING HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL AND THAT'S 25% OF THE EQUITY INTEREST IN A QUALIFIED ENTITLEMENT- THAT'S WHERE THE INDIVIDUALS WOULD IN FACT BE A DISCLOSE IF THERE'S THAT MUCH OF YOUR INTEREST AS A STAKEHOLDER INTO A PIECE OF PROPERTY OR THE L. L. C. THAT INFORMATION WILL BE IN FACT. DISCLOSED IN ADDITION TO THE S. MEMBERS I THINK THE OPPOSITION WERE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT INDIVIDUALS- STATING WHEN THEY WERE UP IN SUPPORT OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL- I DIDN'T MENTION BLACKSTONE OR ANYONE ELSE- DO WHAT I SHARE WITH YOU IS WHAT THIS BILL INTENDS TO DO AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY. THIS BILL IS TO MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO. KNOW WHO THEY'RE ALL WHO THE NEIGHBORS ARE- WHETHER IT'S A CORPORATION WHOSE BEHIND CORPORATION. AND THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC- MY PROPERTY IS MADE PUBLIC AND WHY SHOULD SOMEONE HIDE BEHIND LOC THE PROFESSOR FROM GEORGETOWN INDICATING- THAT LOC WAS NOT CREATED TO HIDE THE INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. BUT IT'S BECOME THAT AND SO THIS BILL EIGHT EIGHT NINE SIX TWO ONE PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY- WE CANNOT TO EIGHT NINE TO STOP A CORPORATION FROM PURCHASING PROPERTY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KNOW. WHO'S BEHIND THESE CORPORATIONS LLCS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. ALL RIGHTY THEN SHE CANCELED THE CALL THE ROLL YES THIS IS EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GIPSON WITH THE MOTION BY SENATOR DID OFF SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AMBERG ABILITY. AMBERG NOT VOTING. BOARD YES. ZERO THE REST. THE REST SO I CONSIDER THIS. HERTZBERG HERTZBERG NOT VOTING JONES. LAYERED BLARED NOT VOTING SKINNER STERN WHITE HOUSE SKI WHITE HOUSE GATE NOT VOTING THERE IS A ONE TO ZERO SO FAR WITH MEMBERS MISSING ALL RIGHT WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL. PARTY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NEXT- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONSOLIDATES AB. SEVEN OH ONE. THANK YOU. MY TALKING POINTS A GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS AT FIRST OFF I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL OF THE COMMITTEE'S AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS LANGUAGE WHICH RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS TO MAKE NEXT DAY DELIVERY POSSIBLE CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON HAVE FORCED WAREHOUSE WORKERS TO MOVE FASTER SERVICE MORE CUSTOMERS IN RECORD AMOUNTS OF TIME AND RISK THEIR OWN BODIES IN THE PROCESS. EVERY DAY THEY FACE INCREASING WORK SPEEDS TO MEET RELENTLESS PRODUCTIVE PRODUCTIVITY QUOTAS THEIR TIME MOMENTS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN PACKAGE UP TO FOUR HUNDRED ITEMS IN OUR OFFICE IN REGARDS TO SIZE OR WEIGHT OF THE ITEM IS STRICTLY MONITORED BY ALL THE RHYTHM. AI MINUTES BETWEEN SCANNING PACKAGES WHERE THE SYSTEM DETECTS THE WORKERS OFF TASK CAN RESULT IN AUTOMATIC DISCIPLINE AND EVEN TERMINATION. CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON OR SETTING THE INDICES INDUSTRY STANDARD OF WHAT'S CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE AMONG THE MOST PHYSICALLY DANGEROUS JOBS IN PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE NUMBERS DON'T LOOK GOOD. AMAZON WORKERS ARE INJURED ON THE JOB TWICE THE AVERAGE RATE OF THE OVERALL WE'RE HOUSING INDUSTRY AND THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE RATE ACROSS ALL PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC AMAZON SERIOUS INJURY RATE WAS ALL OTHER WAREHOUSE EMPLOYERS. ALMOST 89% OF THOSE INJURED WORKERS HAD TO MISS WORK THE EXPERIENCE LONGER RECOVERY PERIODS AND OTHER WORKERS WAREHOUSE WORKERS. WHERE WORKERS HAVE REPEATEDLY GOTTEN INJURED ON THE JOB BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO RUSH THROUGH SAFETY PROTOCOLS TO TRY TO MEET. THE RATE YET MOST STILL CANNOT SPEAK OUT FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB THESE DANGEROUS PRACTICES ARE CAUSING AMAZON TO TURN THREE WORKERS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE AND IT'S SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE. THE ANNUAL TURNOVER RATE FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WITH AMAZON DISTRIBUTION CENTERS HAS SHOT UP TO OVER A 100% PER YEAR. THEY'RE REPLACING THEIR ENTIRE WORK FORCE A 100% OF THE TIME EACH YEAR. WE SHOULD HAVE TO SPECIFY LAW THAT WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOM DRINK WATER OR THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND SANITIZER APPOINTMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE CANNOT STAND BY AND ACCEPT THESE UNDIGNIFIED IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS AS THE NEW FUTURE OF WORK. EIGHTY SEVEN NO ONE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR WORKERS CANNOT BE DISCIPLINED FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA THAT DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS NO LABOR CODE OR CAL OSHA STANDARDS. THAT COMPLIANCE COULD NOT BE COUNTED AGAINST THEM AS BEING OFF TASK IF A WORKER FACES DISCIPLINE WITHIN NINETY DAYS DAYS AFTER THEY FILED A COMPLAINT ABOUT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO QUOTA. AB SEVEN OH ONE WOULD CREATE EVERY BOTTLE FULL PERCEPTION THAT THE AD ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMPANIES WAS RETALIATORY. EIGHTY SEVEN OH ONE WOULD ALSO DIRECT HELLO SHOULDDEVELOP A WAREHOUSE SPECIFIC SAFETY STANDARDS. THAT MINIMIZE WORKER INJURIES IN WAREHOUSES THAT USE PRODUCTION QUOTAS. AFTER TAKING AMENDMENTS AND SENATE LABOR WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS. THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS INCLUDING LIMITING FORMER EMPLOYEES ABILITY REQUEST QUOTE INFORMATION AND PERSONAL WORKS B. DATA. LIMITING THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION SO CONFUSE REPETITIVELY BY CURRENT EMPLOYEES. IN NARROWING THE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY TO ADDRESS UNSAFE QUOTAS AMONG OTHER CHANGES. THE PAGA. IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL ARE ALL CURABLE WE MADE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE WAS VERY CLEAR ON THAT SO THEY ALWAYS HAVE THIRTY DAYS THEY ALWAYS HAVE DAYS TO CURE. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BILL FOR ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE BUT ESPECIALLY WAREHOUSE WORKERS. I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S STILL AVAILABLE I KNOW HE HAD TIME CONSTRAINTS BUT I DID HAVE RON FERRER THE PRESENTLY LA LABOR FED. AS THE LEAD- WITNESS ALL RIGHT MISS. MR ERA ARE YOU AVAILABLE.

THE WAREHOUSING INDUSTRY IS GROWING IT HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE IN LOS ANGELES WE WELCOME THIS GIRL BUT WE MUST PROTECT THE WORK FORCE AND THE INDUSTRY AND SHARE THIS IT HAS NOT BEEN EXPANDED BY BREAKING THE BACKS OF WORKERS AND MOSTLY YOUNG WORKERS OF COLOR. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT WORKERS ARE REPORTING HAVING TO WORK ON YOUR QUOTE IS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THAT WORKERS ARE FORGOING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH AS USING THE RESTROOM SO THAT THEY CAN MEET THE BRUTAL QUOTAS WAREHOUSES. THAT WORKERS IN THEIR EARLY TWENTIES ARE SUFFERING FROM TORN LIGAMENTS BRANDON SERIOUS INJURIES IN INJURIES THAT LEAVE THEM OUT OF WORK FOR MONTHS AT A TIME THESE JOBS ARE MORE DANGEROUS THAN CONSTRUCTION. AND EVEN COAL MINE. HUNDREDS OF I HAD HELPED CREATE WHERE HOW ALLOWS WORKERS TO MEET CODE. STANDARDS WILL NOT ROCKING THEM. OF THE RIGHT TO SAFETY MINE MEMBERS WORK HARD AND WITHOUT THE FEAR OF GETTING GETTING FIRED FOR SPEAKING UP AGAINST WORKING CONDITIONS. THESE ARE THE STANDARDS WE ARE RECREATING WITH A. B. SEVEN OH ONE STANDARDS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THIS INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND THRIVE STANDARDS THAT CAN PREVENT THE HUNDRED AND 50% TURNOVER RATE WE SEE IN THE WAREHOUSES LIKE AMAZON. I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO LOOK AT THE CORE FUNCTIONS OF THIS BILL AND SEE HOW ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE BASIC PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS IN AN INDUSTRY. THAT IS AT THE CENTER OF OUR ECONOMY FOR THE SAKE OF WORKERS AND-WAREHOUSES. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO LEGISLATE THE STRONGEST STANDARDS POSSIBLE I URGE YOU TO VOTE FOR EIGHTY SEVEN OH ONE TODAY AND ON THE SENATE FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MR ERA.

LAST YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOM TOOK A BOLD STEP FORWARD BY SIGNING MY BILL AB NINE SEVEN NINE WHICH REQUIRES EACH PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION WHOSE PRINCIPAL. EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE A MINIMUM NUMBER OF DIRECTORS FROM UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ON ITS BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. THE GOAL WAS PLAIN AND SIMPLE WE NEED TO INCREASE UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS WAS A PRAISE WORTHY STEP FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. HOWEVER THERE ARE PERPETUAL BARRIERS TO UPWARD MOBILITY THAT EXIST IN OUR PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. IT IS IN THIS SPIRIT THAT I HAVE PUT FORWARD A NUMBER OF CIVIL SERVICE REFORMS. THAT ARE REFLECTED IN A B. ONE OH FIVE. FOR STARTERS AB ONE OF FIVE CALLS FOR DIVERSITY ON THE STATE'S BOARD AND COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERS AS YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION DID NOT ALLOW PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON RACE GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. AND THE OPERATION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. EDUCATION AND CONTRACTING THEREFORE THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT REQUIRE DIVERSITY RECORD REGARDING BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. THAT SOLELY HAVE STATE EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOWED TO REQUIRE DIVERSITY ON BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WERE THE BOARD MEMBER COMMISSIONER IS A VOLUNTEER. MAYBE ONE OF FIVE SIX TO DIVERSIFY THE POSITIONS OF VOLUNTEER BOARD MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONERS AS VACANCIES OCCUR. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ESTABLISHED A PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DIVERSITY AND BEST PRACTICES IN EACH ASPECT OF THE DESIGN. ANNOUNCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF EXAMINATIONS FOR THIS TALISMAN OF EMPLOYMENT LISTS. THE DIVERSE PERSPECTIVE ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE HIRING PROCESS PROVIDES FOR A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND BETTER OUTCOMES. EIGHTY ONE OH FIVE PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES MAY DEVELOP MODEL UPWARD MOBILITY GOALS. TO INCLUDE RACE GENDER AND LGBT Q. AS FACTORS TO EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL EQUAL PROTECTION LAWS. MEMBERS THE INCLUSION OF THESE FACTORS ARE SIMPLY MEANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY. I'M AWARE OF THE PROVISIONS OF PROP TWO OH NINE AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION. OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS. THE COLLEGE OUR WORKFORCE ANALYSIS INSTANCES REPORTS INDICATE CONSISTENTLY THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT. OF THOSE IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ARE WHITE ALE AND FEMALE. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM OVER 60% OF THOSE MAKING LESS THAN FORTY THOUSAND OR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPLICIT BIAS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. FINALLY A. B. ONE OH FIVE REQUIRES THAT COLLEGE ARE SUBMITTED WITHIN ITS ANNUAL WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND CENSUS REPORT ALL OF THE ADVERSE ACTIONS TAKEN BY DEPARTMENTS AGAINST EMPLOYEES. THE CALLS FOR THE REPORTS TO INCLUDE THE TYPE OF ADVERSE ACTION THAT THIS CITY GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION IF AVAILABLE. THE GOAL IS TO SEE THAT. THERE IS A IF SEE IF THERE'S A PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE DEPARTMENT'S. MEMBERS OVER THE PAST YEAR ISSUES OF SOCIAL JUSTICE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION HAVE BEEN. TOP AREAS OF CONCERN NATIONALLY AND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY EIGHT YEARS SINCE GOVERNOR BROWN'S REORGANIZATION PLAN FOR CIVIL SERVICE. COLLEGE R. HAS PROVIDED US OVER SEVEN YEARS OF DATA. THAT HIGHLIGHTS THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT HINDER UPWARD MOBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINE TUNE OUR CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS A MANUAL AMOR FOR CO FOUNDER DIRECTOR ABOUT REACH COALITION OF BLACK EMPLOYEES.

SIX SENATOR- SENT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YES MISTER CHAIR AND- THE I HAVE A QUESTION AS TO WHY- WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF STRIPPING AS P. B. AT THE AT THIRTY TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS. A PERSONAL PRACTICES IT JUST SEEMS COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME AND I IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHY YOU TAKE IT AWAY FROM AN INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATION AND PUT IT SOMEWHERE WHERE. THEY DO ALL THE HIRING AND THE FIRING. SEVEN NUMBER HOLD. I THINK THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSPARENCY AND FOR THERE TO BE- A PROCESS IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR THE KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE- THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROMOTION EVALUATED CAN BE EVALUATED IN A WAY THAT THERE WAS CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE TO THE PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THE- THE THINKING BEHIND. OKAY THE PROBE. SO MY AND MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S- MAKE IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I SEE WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH IT BUT SBB WAS SET UP AS AN INDEPENDENT. ENTITY TO DO AUDITS AND INVESTIGATION OF PERSONNEL PRACTICES SO IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME JUST TO SEND THAT OVER TO KELLY CHAR- WHEN THIS IS REALLY A- A BODY THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO LOOK AT- AND HOW OUR SYSTEMS WORK SO- I'M JUST GONNA. I'LL LAVE THAT THERE- AND- AND I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL- DELIVERY HOLD YOU WISH ADDRESS THE POINTER IN YOUR CLOTHES WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS IT. WELL I APPRECIATE THE POINT AND I'M HAPPY TO- PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE DROVE ON TO REACH THAT CONCLUSION BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS AFTER HAVING- REVIEWED THE CALLOUS OUR REPORTS AND HOW- THE- THE ISSUES THAT WERE. IMPEDING THE UPWARD MOBILITY OPPORTUNITIES. THAT WE WERE SEEN NOT. THE BECAUSE THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WAS IN PLACE AT THE ESPYS WERE IN PLACE SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- SOME CLARITY TO THIS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK THAT. THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER ELEMENTS THAT I'M LEAVING OUT TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU TO. ADDRESS FURTHER YOU'RE CONCERNED. PARTY THANK YOU CENTERS FOR. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HOLD THIS AUTHOR IN HIGH REGARD HE'S BEEN A FRIEND OF MINE FOR DECADES BUT I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH THEM WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN I INTRODUCE. THE UPWARD MOBILITY ACT. AND I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY- ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE. FORTUNATELY MY UPWARD MOBILITY ACT HAD TO DO WITH MY SERVICE TAX THAT NEVER MADE IT ANYWHERE IN. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN. BUT I JUST WANTED TO NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT THE UPWARD MOBILITY ACT WAS THE SERVICE TAX THAT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE AND I OPEN MY FRIENDS GOOD WILL THAT HIS UPWARD MOBILITY ACT DOES IT BETTER THAN BY UPWARD MOBILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ALSO HAD ONE IN TRANSPORTATION CALLED UPWARD MOBILITY THANK YOU SENATOR HERS FOR AGAIN. FOR EITHER OF YOU TWO ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- IT IS- YOU KNOW SIMPLY MEMBER HOLDING- I THINK THIS IS A LAUDABLE GOAL I THINK YOU'VE LEFT OUT TWO VERY IMPORTANT CATEGORIES OF THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED. PERSONS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW A DISABLED AS WELL AS VETERANS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO CONSIDER INCLUDING A MORE COMPLETE LIST OF THOSE WHO SHOULD BE- NOT JUST CONSIDERED BUT ALSO FOCUSED UPON FOR PURPOSES OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION AND CERTAINLY- MISTER CHAIRMAN- I TAKE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS A VERY SERIOUSLY AND AS WE REFLECTED BACK AFTER OUR CONVERSATION IT BECAME. JUST TO REITERATE THAT UNDER NINE SEVEN NINE IT WAS REALLY ESTABLISHING WHAT UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES- WHO ARE NOT EVIDENTLY- ON THESE BOARDS- IN A WAY THAT SHOWS REPRESENTATION. THAT DATA REPORTS THAT WERE IN PLACE THEY WERE COULD JUSTIFY EACH GROUP WHO FALLS UNDER THE UNDER REPRESENTED CATEGORIES- WHY THERE IS AN ISSUE THERE AND WHERE THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THEIR REPRESENTATION ON THESE BOARDS. AND AS I. WAS NOTING- THE S. B. SEVEN OH TWO. A LOW MOAN ESTABLISHES REALLY BACK DATA WHICH I THINK IS VERY CRITICAL TO THE NEXT STEP SO IT'S THE DATA IN THE MANDATE AND WITHIN HER BILL THERE'S A CALLS OUT WITHIN SECTION THIRTEEN OH FIVE B. THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON DISABLED DISABILITY STATUS AND VETERAN STATUS. AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE BOARD MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONS AND SINCE THAT'S CALLED OUT CURRENTLY IN ER BILL WHICH THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED IT IS THE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE PRECURSOR TO THE NEXT STEP WHICH WOULD BE THE MANDATE WHICH THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO AND I'M VERY HAPPY. TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT- AS WE GO FORWARD HOW THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED IN FUTURE BILLS ALREADY THANKS VERY MUCH- I WAS- OUR MOTION YES CENTER THE RUSSELL MOVES I'M SORRY.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- FIRST I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S HERE AND HIS CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH MY TAFF TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE TEACHERS CONCERNS. BOB TURN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT IN A. B. NINE FORTY EIGHT A BILL THAT REQUIRES THAT EVERY CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY. CONTAIN A NOTICE INFORMING THE BUYER AND SELLER OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPORT ANY SUSPICION OF DISCRIMINATORY APPRAISAL. BY A REAL ESTATE APPRAISER THROUGH THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS INTERNET WEBSITE OR TELEPHONE NUMBER. FOR THOSE THAT SEEK TO REFINANCE THEIR PROPERTY THE NOTICE WILL BE PROVIDED IN THE LOAN MATERIAL. MEMBERS THE FAIR HOUSING ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT PROHIBITS HOME APPRAISERS FROM DISCRIMINATING BASED ON RACE RELIGION NATIONAL ORIGIN OR GENDER. HOWEVER OVER FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE ACT WAS PUT IN PLACE THE HOMES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE STILL BEING UNDERVALUED. RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF DOCUMENTED INSTANCES WHERE THE HOMES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE BEING UNDERESTIMATED. FOR EXAMPLE IN MARIN CITY AN APPRAISER S. UNDERESTIMATED A BLACK COUPLES HOME BY NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN OAKLAND AN APPRAISER LOWBALL THE VALUE OF A BLACK AND PORTER RICAN COUPLE'S HOME BY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND. THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL HEADLINES IN NEWS REPORTS OF RACIAL BIAS IN REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. MAYBE NINE FORTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE BUREAU REAL ESTATE APPRAISERS TO PLACE ON ITS EXISTING COMPLAINT FORM. A PLACE FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS OR WITH PERMISSION THE REAL ESTATE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO VOLUNTARILY PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. NINE FOUR EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE BUREAU TO COMPILE THE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. AND SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON OR BEFORE. JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IN TERMS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE AN APPLICANT. FOR APPRAISAL LICENSE INTO A COMPLETE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND ELIMINATION. OF BIAS TRAINING FINALLY THIS BILL ADDS ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT REGARDING DISCRIMINATION AND THE PROVISIONS OF APPRAISAL SERVICES. MEMBERS FOR MANY CALIFORNIA IS THEIR HOME IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE GREATEST ASSET. THE EQUITY IN THEIR HOME ALLOWS THEM TO FIND CONTINUING EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN RETIREMENT AND HEALTH EXPENSES. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TIMELY BILL AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. TONIGHT FOR THOSE OF THOSE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OUR OUT OF BOX WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND MIKE BELOW WITH THE APPRAISALINSTITUTE. ALL RIGHTY MR BELOW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS NOTED I AM MIKE BELOW MY CLIENT IS CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE APPRAISAL INSTITUTE. THE NATION'S LARGEST REAL ESTATE APPRAISER ORGANIZATION. GIVEN THE HOUR I'LL BE LEADING THE FREE- THESE MAINSTREAM MEDIA REPORTS ARE VERY VERY CONCERNING OUR HEARTS HOPE THAT THERE WERE SOME EXPLANATION OTHER THAN RACE. BETTER HEAD SUGGESTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE- REAL ESTATE APPRAISING SHOULD ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF A PIECE OF REAL PROPERTY AT A GIVEN POINT OF TIME. IN THE RACE NATIONALITY ETHNICITY. SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ETCETERA SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VALUE SO WE THINK THAT- MR HOLDEN IS PUT TOGETHER THOUGHTFUL PACKAGE HERE IT'S NOT JUST CONTINUING EDUCATION IT'S DISCLOSURE IT'S A PLACE TO COMPLAIN. IT'S A START START STRAIGHT OUT OF PROHIBITION IN THE FIGURE APPOINTMENT AND HOUSING LAWS WE THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU MR BELOW.

ARE ENTITLED TO AN UNBIASED APPRAISAL IS COMPLETED ONE NATION TO THE PARTIES AND ALSO INJURED NOTICES ARE INCLUDED IN THE MATERIAL SHOULD THE CONSUMER TO BE INVOLVED IN A REFINANCE. OF THE PROPERTY THAT REQUIRED AN APPRAISAL. HOME IS. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT TRANSACTIONS BASSMAN MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WILL EVER MAKE MAKE NO MISTAKE THERE IS A HUGE SOCIETAL CAUGHT THE DEVALUATION OF PROPERTY EITHER FROM BIAS OR FROM SOME OTHER MEANS THE VALUE PROPERTY IS AN OBSTACLE TO BUILDING EQUITY WHICH WORKS TO BRING PETS AWAY INCOME INEQUALITY IN OUR STATE REDUCED PROPERTY VALUES ALSO DESTABILIZED COMMUNITIES AND REDUCING EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THERE IS SO VITAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES- AS THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN THE ALL CLEAR BOTH POINTED OUT OVER THE PAST YEAR ALONE THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HEADLINE MAKING STORY THE COAL MINERS BEING LOW BALLED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. IN THE APPRAISAL PROCESS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN PREDOMINATELY BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE LEGACY OF REDLINING SO WE FOUND IN THIS IS. SIMPLY A POLY. EIGHTY NINE FOUR EIGHT CERTAINLY DOES ACCOMPLISH THEIR GARGANTUAN TASK OF ELIMINATING BIAS IN THE APPRAISAL INDUSTRY BUT THROUGH A SERIES OF BOTTLED BEVERAGES IMPROVED EXISTING LAW. AND WILL MOST DEFINITELY HAVE THE EFFORT EVERY. EFFECT OF REDUCING BIAS IN THE INDUSTRY AGAIN WE ARE SO PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND. ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

AS A BILL THREE TWO THREE LOS TABLETS TO CLEANER STANDARD NECESSARY TO HOLD LICENSE LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR DEATHS BECAUSE UNDER THE REGULATORY DUTY OF CARE. ADDITIONALLY UNCHANGED FOR TWENTY YEARS. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE ADULTS A STATE AUDITOR RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PENALTY AMOUNTS. MOVING FORWARD ROBUST AND CLEAR NURSING HOME OVERSIGHT BY CITY PH WILL BE CRITICAL THE RETURN OF BURKE FURTHER CHARGES THAT I'VE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED. BY THE COLD IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CLASS W. CITATIONS OF THE MOST SERIOUS AND ONLY ISSUE THE CDPH PROVES THAT THE FACILITIES ACTIONS IN THE JURY TO REGULATIONS WAS THE CAUSE. FOR RESIDENTS TO. THE CURRENT DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE LEGAL STANDARD IS STATUTE HAS CREATED INCONSISTENCY WHEN APPLYING CLASS W. CITATIONS IN OUR STATE'S NURSING HOMES. BECAUSE COURTS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE IS CONFUSING. AND UNCLEAR. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS SINCE REJECTED THE APPLICATION APPROXIMATE CAUSE AND PORTS OF CENTRALIZED ON THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST. THE CHANGE TO SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR PROPOSE UNDER EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WHEN NURSING HOMES AND FACILITIES APPEAL CLASS DOUBLE A CITATION AND A SUPERIOR COURT. THE STATE HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF FROM THE JUDGE MUST APPLY THAT CAUSATION STANDARD INSTRUCTION. ADDITIONALLY COUNTY MILES CREATED DISINCENTIVES FOR FACILITIES TO VIOLATE HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND THESE AMOUNTS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE CRUISES AND REVISES THOSE TREACHERY AMOUNTS. OF POSITIONAL SAY THERE NEEDS TO BE A SECOND FORESEEABILITY TEST INCLUDED WAS A CENTRAL FACTOR. THIS HAS BEEN REJECTED BY CITY PH THE CONCERN AND I AGREE IT'S FORESEEABILITY IN THE PRESENCE OF A RESIDENT WITH THE COAL MORBID MORBIDITY. COULD RESOLVE THE FACILITY FROM THEIR DUTY OF CARE. ADDITIONALLY UNDER CURRENT LAW CPA STILL NEEDS A SHOW OF THE DEATH RESULTED FROM A VIOLATION IN REGULATION. DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE DEATH. C. PH FOUR SORRY NINETY IS NOT A DISK. AFFECTING YOUR HOME. IT IS REVEALED FLAWS IN OUR REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABLE TO PROPERLY APPLY OVERSIGHT TO LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE FOR BROWN TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESIDENCE HALL RESIDENTS HARM OR DEATH. BY THIS DOING SO CITY PH CAN ALSO IDENTIFY AND CORRECT A BAD PERFORMANCE FACILITIES OF THE QUALITY CARE. IS IMPROVED FOR FUTURE RESIDENTS.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THIS IS GREGORY KRAMER ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. LAST MONTH THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THE INSPECTOR GENERAL RELEASED- DATASYNAPSE OUT WITH FINDINGS THAT WERE ALARMING BUT NOT SURPRISING THEY FOUND THE OVERALL MORTALITY RATE IN NURSING HOMES ROSE OVER 32% AND TWENTY TWENTY AND THE PRESIDENT OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME INFECTED WITH COPA NINETEEN THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. BUT NOT ALL NURSING HOME STATES CUPBOARDS DEVASTATION EQUALLY NURSING HOMES THAT WERE PROBLEMATIC BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER OUTBREAKS WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE A REPEAT OF THE UNNECESSARY DEATHS. AND SUFFERING THAT WE WITNESSED LAST YEAR. DISABILITY RIGHTS ITS RECORD KEEPING ARCING HOME RESIDENTS SAVE EXPLAINS WHY THE CURRENT LAW FALLS SHORT OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT. IN A REPORT WE DETAIL HUNDREDS OF INCONSISTENT RESULTS AND LICENSING CITATIONS OF NURSING HOME DEATHS. AND THAT THE CURRENT LEGAL STANDARD GOVERNING CITATIONS FOR NURSING HOME DEATHS IS FLAWED AND CONFUSING AND LEADS TO AN UNEVEN AND INSUFFICIENT PROTECTION OF RESIDENTS. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE ADOPTS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR STANDARD A TERM USED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND WHICH WILL HELP PROVIDE CLARITY AND IN TURN MORE CONSISTENT AND BETTER LICENSING OVERSIGHT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS THE FACILITIES THAT TAKE CARE OF THEM AND FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I ASK. FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF BABY THREE TWENTY THREE THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW NURSING RESIDENCE SUFFERED IMMEASURABLY LAST YEAR AND WE OWE IT TO THEM TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF NURSING HOME CARE. OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING CARE STANDARDS ARE PRETTY GOOD AND THEY HAVE BEEN FOR A LONG TIME. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN. ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ENFORCEMENT. WHICH HAS RANGED FROM LACKLUSTER TO ABYSMAL FOR DECADES. SIMPLY BILL THREE TWENTY THREE WILL ENHANCE THE CARE PROVIDED IN NURSING HOMES THE BILL CLARIFIES THE CRITERIA FOR DOUBLY CITATION SO THAT WE BETTER DETER THE CONDUCT THAT CAUSES THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT. IN THE BILL GIVES A LONG OVERDUE INFLATIONARY BUMP TO PENALTY AMOUNTS TO ENSURE THAT DETERRENCE IS NOT ERODED BY DEPRECIATING DOLLARS. OUR CITATION SYSTEM IS VERY. COMPLAINTS AGAINST NURSING HOMES CONTINUE TO RISE EVERY YEAR BUT THE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE COMPLAINTS REMAIN FLAT AND LETHARGIC JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY I SPEAK TO RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE BEYOND FRUSTRATED BE IT BY THE STATE'S FAILURE TO MEANINGFULLY ENFORCE THE RULES MEANT TO PROTECT THEM. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE WILL UPDATE A LOT OF BRING MORE CONSISTENCY IN MORE JUSTICE TO ENFORCEMENT. EIGHTY THREE TWENTY THREE IS ALSO PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA PROTECT PLAN A PACKAGE OF BILLS. AIMING TO REPAIR BREAKDOWNS IN LONG TERM CARE EXPOSED.

FINALLY THEY'RE STILL SIGNIFICANTLY MAYORS AT ELEVEN OH JUNE WHICH WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM LAST YEAR. AND IS IT A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN. THE EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION TEMPLATE THAT WAS CONTEMPLATED IN AT ELEVEN A JUNIOR. STUDENT THAT IS A PROCESS THAT CAN MORE READILY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CHANGES IN H. TWO EIGHT GOVERNING LAW.

THANK YOU SO MUCH- MY NAME ISN'T DERIVED FROM A DIRECTOR OF LITIGATION FOR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE WE CURRENTLY REPRESENT HAPPENED THE PAST RED RECOVERED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS ON ISSUES LIKE THIS EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN DOES NOT CHANGE THE CASE ODD DEFINITION OF COMPENSABLE TRAVEL TIME FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS. IN CALIFORNIA ALL TIME SPENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF AN EMPLOYER MUST BE COMPENSATED. IN COURT AND MARIO MAKE CLEAR THAT EXTENDS TO TRAVEL TIME AND CASES LIKE THOSE REFERENCING THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SDLC AND AL CONTAR REJECT THE NOTION THAT IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT TIME IS CHARACTERIZED AS MANAGER MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY. AND RECOGNIZE THAT AND ILLUSORY CHOICE IS NO CHOICE AT ALL. THAT COMPATIBILITY TURNS ON WHETHER THE EMPLOYER CONTROLS WHEN WHERE AND HOW THE EMPLOYEE GETS TO WORK. H. TWO A. WORKERS ARE BROUGHT INTO THE COUNTRY BY THEIR EMPLOYERS AND ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC HOUSING SITE THEY HAVE NO CARS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS AVAILABLE. AND THEIR ACCESS TO OTHERS IS LIMITED. EMPLOYERS CONTROL THEIR H. TO A CRUISE BY TELLING THEM WHEN AND WHERE TO REPORT NOT TO A FIELD OF WORK-LOCATION BUT TWELVE BUSTER VAN AFTER HOUSING SITE. WORKERS ADVANTECH INTO THE WORK SITE SOMETIMES AN HOUR AWAY. AFTER THE FIELD WORK AND THEY WAIT FOR THE. EMPLOYER TO SEND THE BUS TO COME AND PICK THEM UP. THEY ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE EMPLOYER AND MUST BE PAID FOR THAT TIME AT THE REGULAR RATE OF PAY. WHICH FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS IS GENERALLY BE A WERE A HIGHER RATE OF PAY SET BY FEDERAL H. TWO A. LAW. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO REPLACE U. S. WORKERS WITH H. TWO WAY. THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SEIZE UPON THE VOLUNTARY LANGUAGE OF MARIANE. AND IGNORE ITS ANALYSIS AND THE TWENTY YEARS OF CASE LAW APPLYING IT TO THE BALDING SITUATIONS. THEY DO SO TO PROTECT EMPLOYERS WHO CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT AND ON PLACARDS IN THE BOXES. PRESENT AN ILLUSORY CHOICE BY STATING THAT TRANSPORTATION IS VOLUNTARY WHEN WORKERS HAVE NO REAL ALTERNATIVE. TO GET TO THE WORK SITE. CURRENTLY AND UNDER PROPOSED SECTION. TWENTY EIGHT TEN POINT SIXTY FIVE OF THE BILL. WORKERS H. TWO A. WORKERS WHO HAVE A REAL ALTERNATIVE TO GET TO WORK AND ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE THE BUS. WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTRY'S WRAP IT UP RIGHT AND I'VE- YES THEY ARE. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN MILLION SHARES THAT WORKERS ARE ADVISED TO THESE RIGHT AND OTHER WELL ESTABLISHED RIGHT AND I WOULD BE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I THINK THAT EXHAUST WITNESSES ON THE PHONE MODERATOR ANY OF THE WINDOWS ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION- TO A. B. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN. IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. I HAVE LINE NUMBER SIX SIX FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NAVY. EIGHT FIVE SEVEN- THIS IS KEITH TOMATO WITH- CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED AMERICANS ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THANK YOU VERY MUCH READ NEXT PLACE. TO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME FOR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AND HE BEAT FIVE SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. I HAVE NO ONE QUEUING UP ON THE PHONE ALL RIGHT CAN YOU LET'S COME BACK TO THE FLOOR- QUESTIONS COMMENTS BY MEMBERS YES CENTER BOARD JUST. FIGURES FEATURE. DISTURB POINT OF CLARIFICATION MAYBE I CAN POSE A QUESTION TO THREE YOU TOO THE AUTHOR- IF HE'S WILLING TO ACCEPT MY QUESTION WOULD BE. IT IS THERE ANY CASE LAW THAT. THAT EXPLAINS IN DETAIL THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ENTITLED TO PAY. WHILE IN TRANSIT AND WE HEARD FROM SOMEONE THAT CALLED IN IT SAYS WHEN YOU'RE UNDER THE CONTROL THAT THAT BE THE OPERATIVE- PART OF THE ANALYSIS BUT WAS THIS RESOLVED IN THE COURT SYSTEM. BUT SELLING NUMBER CAR HERE SO THANK YOU THE RESEARCHERS UNDER FARM THE REALITY IS THAT. THE COURT SYSTEM. MORE GENERALLY TALK ABOUT MANITOBA SO VOLUNTARY WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS ACTUALLY A B. V. SEVEN IS DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW. AND ACTUALLY PUTS IN FACTORS TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION BECAUSE ONE CAN SAY VOLUNTARY. BUT AS INDICATED BY THE BY THE WITNESS OFTENTIMES A LOSER YOU SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE DOES NOT A PERSONAL VEHICLE THEY CAN'T TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. TO FROM THE WORK SITE YOU HAVE NO REAL OTHER REAL OR TURNER TO TAKE A TRANSPORTATION. PROBLEM THE REQUIRED BY THE EMPLOYER ASIA TAKE CHANCES PROVIDED FOR BY THE EMPLOYER THESE ALL FACTORS THAT ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH. ON THE SURFACE MAYBE DIDN'T MAYBE DEEMED VOLUNTARY IN ACTUALITY IT'S MANDATED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR DUTIES. R. M. THANK YOU IT SEEMS AS IF THE BASED ON THE REPRESENTATIONS BY AT LEAST ONE OTHER CALLERS AT THIS WAS A MATTER OF. LAW THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND THIS WAS SIMPLY EFFECTUATENG- YOU KNOW SOME SORT OF- CASE LAW DETERMINATION- IT I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO WRAP MY ARMS AROUND THAT IF WE HAVE FEDERAL LAW THAT'S REQUIRING TRANSPORTATION. AND THEN FOLKS ARE- OBLIGING- THAT SERVICE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES- THAT SEEMS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. BUT TO PAY THEM I IN TRANSIT JUST SEEMS LIKE A BIT MUCH WHEN I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT AN AGRICULTURAL AREA AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE DISTANCES ON IT OTHER TIMES- THE RELATIVELY CLOSE. THE WAITING TIME IS THAT THE THRUST OF WHY YOU'RE PROPOSING THIS BILL THAT THEY'RE SIGNIFICANT WAITING TIME EITHER AT THE BEGINNING. OF THE DAY BEGINNING IN A SHIFT TOWARD THE END OF THE SHIFT. THE CENTER THE REALITY IS THAT. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THESE CONTRACTORS ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CONTRACTORS IN TERMS OF WHEN THEIR SHIFT BEGINS AND WHERE THEY GO EVERY DAY FOR THEIR SHARE SO THE REALITY IS IT'S NOT- OPTIONAL- THAT THEY STEP ON THE BUS TO GO TO THE WORK SITE. AND SO THEIR WORK DAY STARTS WHEN THEIR EMPLOYER TELLS THEM THE STARS BECAUSE THEY DON'T STEP ON THE BUS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WORK. ALL RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR IS THAT I'M SORRY GO AHEAD AND I DON'T THEY DON'T FINISH HERE- I THINK I UNDERSTAND- WHAT THIS ISSUE IS- WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A PANDEMIC. WHERE AGRICULTURE AS A WHOLE HAS SUFFERED GREATLY- IN A IN WE SHOULD ALL BE TERRIBLY APPRECIATIVE OF THOSE THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE H. TWO A. VISA PROGRAMS THAT WERE DESPERATELY RELIANT UPON. WE'RE ALSO IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE IN A DEVASTATING DROUGHT IN THAT DROUGHT. HAS IS PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE ON FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO WHEN YOU ADD NOT ONLY THE ENORMOUS REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS. THE DAD- ARE IMPOSED UPON THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BAR NONE THE GOLD STANDARD OF THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO AGRICULTURE. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AS WELL AS LABOR PROTECTION. THAT YOU THEN MOVE INTO. OUR WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH IN THE PANDEMIC NOW MOVING TO DROUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU CAN MORE YOU CAN IMPOSE UPON- IN INDUSTRY. AND NOT EXPECTED TO BREAK- WITH THAT I THINK. ALL ALL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU SORT OF BORED JUST OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISE SENATOR ALSO MOVES THE BILL. ALL RIGHT WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCHER- AND THE REALITY IS THAT- YOU KNOW IN IN RESPONSE OF THE COMMISSAR POSITION- THAT. FIRST OF ALL THE DETAILS THE ISSUE WE WILL WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF GIVING A MORE DISCUSSION LABOR COMMISSIONER AND THOSE WITH ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED- AND- HIS DAUGHTERS. THE REALITY IS FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT MANDATE THESE RICE WE NOTICED A FORMER OCCURS AND THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING. AND ULTIMATELY THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED EMPLOYMENT LAW WHEN IT COMES TO BEING UNDER CONTROL THE EMPLOYER. HAS THE OPTION IS OPPOSITE SHE INDICATED REFER TO TECH WORKERS- FROM THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE'S LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO MAKING A CHOICE OF DRIVING THEIR TESLA TAKING CALTRAIN OR STEPPING INTO A BUS THAT HAS WIFI AND COFFEE AND WENT ON TO WORK IN SILICON VALLEY- AND A FARMER OCCUR AS BEING TOLD WHERE TO LIVE- EIGHT AND IS BEING KEPT UNDER ALMOST COMPLETE CONTROL THE EMPLOYER. AND SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION THAT IS EXPERIENCED BY MANY THOUSANDS AND I'LL END BY SAYING. THAT THE CALL THE CRISIS HIT FARM WORKERS- AS BAD AS ANYONE IN OURNATION AND OUR STATE THEY'RE THE ONES DYING THEY'RE THE ONES ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AND BE WITH OUR FAMILIES AND BE SAFE AND SECURE- AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF. WERE PUTTING A LOT OF TIME INTO THIS BILL A VALUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I'M. GRATEFUL AND WITHOUT A RECIPIENT'S RIVAL. ALL RIGHTY- BETTER CHIEF COUNSEL IF YOU CALL THE ROLL YES THIS IS EIGHT. EIGHT FIVE.

OUT OF THE SEWER LINE DEPENDS ON MAKE WE LEARNED THAT WE COULD ENGAGE REMOTELY DIGITALLY AND TELEPHONICALLY AND WE'RE LOOKING TO RESERVE THAT FOR LARGER SECTIONS THIS BILL ALSO HAS- SOME RESIDENTS BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE THE ORIGINAL BROWN ACT WAS ALSO ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE NINE GREAT COINCIDENCE. THE NOW ALMOST SEVENTY YEARS LATER WE'RE WORKING TO MODERNIZE THE WAY GOVERNMENT OPERATES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS THIS BILL REQUIRES CITY COUNCILS AND COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISOR MEETINGS IN JURISDICTIONS WITH A POPULATION OF OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO RESPECT EITHER THROUGH TELEPHONE OR INTERNET WE KNOW THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE AS LOW GOVERNMENTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED A REMOTE PARTICIPATION OPTIONS RUN PANDEMIC. TO ADDRESS COST CONCERNS ARE TAKEN MANY SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR FAR TOO LONG MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN PRECLUDED FROM PURCHASING GOVERNMENT DUE TO REQUIREMENTS ATTEND IN PERSON THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY SOMEONE WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND SAY A TUESDAY HEARING AT NINE PM. AND SAT THERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS IN ORDER TO MAKE A COMMENT SO THEIR VOICES HEARD BUT AS LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE ALREADY HAD TO IMPLEMENT WAYS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE OUR MULTI WE WANT TO SEE THESE OPPORTUNITIES CONTINUED AFTER THE BAND THAT MAKE IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THE VOICES OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND REDUCE EXISTING BARRIERS IN PLACE THAT STOP THE PURPOSE MAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS ON A. B. ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THREE NINE AND WITH THAT I HAVE HOPEFULLY WHO ARE STILL ON THE LINE IT'S DAVID SNYDER FROM THE EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST MEDICAL MISSION AND BONNIE LIEBERMAN FROM THE SANTA CLARA UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD ALREADY. THANK YOU MR LIEBERMAN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. I AM ALL RIGHT. CLOSE YOUR EYES THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS BONNIE LIEBERMAN I AM A BOARD MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE JANITOR UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT AND. EIGHTY THREE THREE NINETY DAY- THE LOCAL. ELECTED IN A DRASTIC INCREASE IN PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND ENGAGEMENT IN OUR MEETING THEM. IT'S STILL A TIMELY AND VERY MUCH NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AFTER SCHOOL- NUMBER I OFTEN WORK WITH PARENTS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR MEETING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT TRAVEL WITH MY CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR MEETINGS THAT MAY GO ON FOR SEVERAL HOURS. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE BEEN REQUIRED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC. WHICH HAS INCLUDED NEW MEETING. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC REGULAR IN PERSON BOARD MEETINGS WITH A TRACKING MAYBE A DOZEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. DURING THE PENDENNIS CAN BASE PANDEMIC THANKS TO THE LIVE STREAM AND RELATED PUBLIC ACCESS BE A WEAPON ARE AND TELEPHONE. I'VE SEEN IT EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION BECAUSE WE ALLOW REMOTE PARTICIPATION THROUGH OPTIONS LIKE BEER WHICH HAS BEEN CRITICAL AND ENGAGING PARENTS. AND DISCUSSING REMOTE EDUCATION AND THE SAME PRE OPENING UP OUR SCHOOL. I'VE ALSO HEARD FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW THE PUBLIC HAS SEEN A LOT OF DOORS OPEN FOR THEM TO ENGAGE YOU PHYSICALLY AND MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD THANK YOU BYE I REALLY HOPE YOU CONTINUE OFFERING VIRTUAL PARTICIPATION IN BOARD MEETINGS BECAUSE I CAN'T ATTEND IN PERSON. AND BEING ABLE TO ATTEND MEETINGS VIRTUALLY HAS HELPED ME BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE GOINGS ON IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. I KNOW A LOT OF LOCAL AGENCIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE'VE ALREADY FOUND WAYS TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY. AND THE INCREASED AVENUES OF PARTICIPATION ARE WELL WORTH THAT. I'M DELIGHTED OFFICIALS WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO INCREASE OUR OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AND THIS BILL IS A GREAT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND THE AUTHORS MISSION FOR INCREASING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISLI ROMAN MISTER SNYDER. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DAVID SNYDER AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT COALITION WE ADVOCATE FOR FREE SPEECH OPENING IT OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CIVIC AFFAIRS WE HELP JOURNALISTS ACTIVISTS ACADEMICS AND MANY OTHERS ACCESS THE GOVERNMENT AND WE DO SO BY PROVIDING EDUCATION. ONE ON ONE LEGAL COUNSELING LITIGATION AND MORE WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EIGHTY THREE THREE NINE WE BELIEVE IN THE HEALTH OF ANY DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY TO OBSERVE IN INTERACT EACH ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THIS MEANS BEING ABLE TO SEE YOU IN HERE IMPORTANTLY TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC MEETINGS IN REAL TIME BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS USED TO MEAN HAVING TO RANGE CHILDCARE TAKE TIME OFF WORK GETTING A RIDEOR PAYING FOR TRANSIT TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES WITHIN RURAL COMMUNITIES OR WORSE BEING ABLE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO HEALTH CONCERNS OR DISABILITY. THAT'S A BURDEN SO HIGH THAT IT MADE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OUT OF REACH FOR FAR TOO MANY ANALYSTS GOVERNMENT'S FREE TO MAKE. DECISIONS WITHOUT INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S ONE SO LINING FROM PANDEMIC IT IS AN AXIS TO GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING BECAME AVAILABLE TO A BROADER RANGE OF PEOPLE THAT WAS BEFORE. EIGHTY THREE THREE NINE WOULD ENSURE THESE GAMES ARE NOT LOST FOR CITY COUNCIL AND COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISOR MEETINGS. IN JURISDICTIONS WITH POPULATIONS OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. IT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE CONSTITUENTS OF EITHER CALL IN OR INTERFACE INTERNET BASED OPTION FOR PARTICIPATION. FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF AGENCIES DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY COULD PROVIDE THIS KIND OF ACCESS LOCAL DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA DEPENDS ON TRANSPARENCY FOR ITSELF. IT'S WHY ABILITY PARTICULARLY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE AND SO THE FIRST AMENDMENT COALITION URGES THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THIS LEVEL OF ACCESS IS MAINTAINED AS PROVIDED. THANK YOU.

AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE AT THIS TIME ON THE PHONE PLEASE ALL WRITING YOU THANK YOU- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS SITTING YES- JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A SWIMMINGLY. I'M I'M INTRIGUED BY A COUPLE OF ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THAT I AGREE WITH- I DO BELIEVE THAT- HAVING THIS ABILITY TO ACCESS OUR MEETINGS HAS. INCREASED DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA FOR SURE SO I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND ONE CONCERN THAT MAYBE YOU COULD DRESS- WHY THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND- NUMBER- WHY NOT JUST MAKE IT ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THEN NUMBER TWO I NOTICED THAT YOU TOOK. AMENDMENTS AT SOME POINT IN TIME THAT REMOVED- THE STATE. LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE AGENCIES FROM THE SAME REQUIREMENT- WHY EXEMPT WHAT RIGHT WHY REQUIRE THIS ON LOCALITIES BUT NOT THE STATE PLAN I THINK THE ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE. SACRAMENTO AND WHEREVER THE STATE AGENCIES MEET IS ACTUALLY HARDER TO GET TO. THEN THE LOCALITIES THAT WERE REQUIRING- THESE EFFORTS ON. THANK YOU SIR JOHN'S I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY GREAT QUESTION WHEN I BEGAN THE BILL IT DID APPLY TO ALMOST EVERY AGENCY AND BODY INCLUDING US IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE- BUT- GOING TO IT IS A PROCESS I CERTAINLY HAD TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT I DID NOT ENVISION TAKING. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THIS THRESHOLD FOR LARGE COUNTIES IN LARGE CITIES- NOT IDEAL BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT SHOULD BE APPLICABLE IN FACT ACTUALLY ADMINISTRATION HAS A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGEOUT THERE FOR STATE AGENCIES RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW OUR HOUSES WILL CONCUR WITH THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY CERTAINLY SOMETHING I'M INTERESTED IN AND BECAUSE THIS BILL HAS A SUNSET IN TWENTY EIGHT DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS IS AN ISSUE WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING ON. SHOULD THE GOVERNOR SIGNED-IT BUT I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AS EXPENSIVE AS POSSIBLE. YOU'RE IN YOUR INITIAL. A PROPOSAL WHEN YOU STARTED THE BILL WHAT IT DIDN'T HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT. OF TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. I GOT TO READ DOES NOT. TURN FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT LIMIT. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR JOHNSON A COUPLE EURO. MISTER CHAIR- I THINK MIKE MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM IS IT THAT. THE THE BOARD OR THE COUNCIL HAS TO IMMEDIATELY CEASE THE MEETING AND- AND RESCHEDULE IT. I HEARD OF THAT CONCERN VIA THE OPPOSITION BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT CONCERN I MEAN IT'S THE SAME CASE IF YOU'RE HAVING A PUBLIC MEETING IN THE ALL THE POWER WENT OFF. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CONSTITUTES A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF THE MEETING I DON'T KNOW IF MY WITNESS FROM THE FIRST OF A COLLISION WITH THE COMMENT ON THAT BUT I DON'T. READ A SUCH. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT. WELL I AM CERTAINLY WILLING TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR- EX. EXPERT HAS TO SAY BUT- THE BROWN ACT REQUIRES. ACCESS AND IF YOU IF FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM YOU HAVE SOMEBODY THAT DISRUPTS- A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO CALL IN AND TOTALLY DISRUPT THE MEETING I MEAN I WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR CITY IS WHEN PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND THEY DISRUPTED THE MEETING. WE RECESS UNTIL WE CAN GET CONTROL OF THE MEETING BACK AGAIN AND IF WE COULDN'T CONTINUE BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF A DISRUPTION WE HAD TO. CANCEL THE REST OF THE MEETING AND LEAVE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT THANKFULLY BUT I AM. I LIKE TO BUILD. THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT A SYSTEM CAN FAIL. AND IF IT MEANS THAT THE MEETING HAS TO BE CANCELED THEN YOU END UP WITH TIMELINE CONSTRAINTS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO DO THINGS BY A CERTAIN DATE LIKE PASS A BUDGET BY A CERTAIN DATE- POOR FINISH- IF YOU'RE DOING BOND WORK THERE'S USUALLY DEADLINES THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THAT. THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT COULD ARISE AND FOR US TO TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND FRANKLY I DON'T HAVE VERY MANY I HAVE NO CITIES. BUT A COUPLE OF COUNTIES IF THIS WOULD APPLY TO- THAT. SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT IT DOESN'T APPLY IN MY AREA BUT I AM CONCERNED WITH THAT WITH THE CONSTRAINTS. THAT DISAPPEARS TO PUT. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTICIPATION AND IT'S FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE THROUGH WITH COVERT- I JUST WORRY ABOUT THAT TIMELINE AND I WORRY ABOUT. BURDENING IS THAT IT AND NOT HAVING A AN ESCAPE HATCH. OR IF YOUR LINE GOES AND I AND I AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. THIS ACCESS IS ILLUSORY. BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO MOVE GO OVER TO A PARK. OR A LIBRARY IN ORDER TO GET INTERNET ACCESS. AND SO IT'S IT MAY WORK IN- BRILL URBANIZED CENTERS BUT IT IT DOESN'T WORK QUITE AS WELL IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE INTERNET ACCESS IS. IS NOT AVAILABLE SO I AM CONCERNED WITH THE- END RESULT AND BECAUSE OF THAT I PROBABLY WON'T END UP SUPPORTING IT TODAY. UNLESS I GET AN ASSURANCE THAT THERE WILL BE AN ESCAPE HATCH FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT- BUT FOR SOME REASON LOSE ACCESS TO THEIR INTERNET THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH THEIR MEETING AND- AND TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE. THE SENATE CAREER I THINK YOU BRING UP THREE GOOD POINTS- THE FIRST I'LL JUST SAY ABOUT THE DISRUPTION IS YOU KNOW I THINK BECAUSE WE'VE EXPERIENCED HERE IT'S MUCH EASIER TO CONTROL MAYBE A HUNDRED ROWDY GUESTS- VIRTUALLY. THAT A HUNDRED ROWDY GUESTS IN YOUR CHAMBER SURFACE GIVEN DOWN TO THE OPTION OF. ONE OR THE OTHER I THINK WE BUSINESS'S SAKE CHOOSE TO HAVE A VIRTUAL OPTION. AND IT'S AGAIN REMEMBER IS HAVING ADDITIONAL THE OPTION OF TELEPHONIC. OR VIRTUAL SO PEOPLE IN RURAL COUNTIES WHICH OF COURSE WE HAVE A REAL DIGITAL VIBE WHICH IS A REAL PROBLEM- STILL PEOPLE HAVE THE OPTION TO CALL IN OR- ZOOM IN OR WHATEVER ONLINE PLATFORM JURISDICTION CHOOSES TO DO SO. SO I'M HOPING THAT RATHER THAN HAVING TO DRIVE TO YOUR SKIN YOU SEE. IN A RURAL DISTRICT IT'S MUCH EASIER TO SAY DRIVE TO PARK OR GET ON THE PHONE AND CALL IN A PRESCRIPTION. FOR YOUR FIVE MINUTES OF PUBLIC TESTIMONY PROBABLY MORE. MORE EFFICIENT AND THEN I WOULD SAY THE THIRD THING TO THAT POINT IS. TO MY KNOWLEDGE DURING THE YEAR PLUS THEM ENDEMIC I DON'T KNOW OF ANY JURISDICTION WHICH- AND KEEP IN MIND. YOU NEVER IT HAS UNIVERSAL EXISTED BEYOND OR SIX JUST TO UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND. I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FAILURES AND OUTAGES THAT EVER EXISTED. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT IN THE CASE OF THIS JUST BEING EDITION WITH THAT ALSO EXISTS SO I. I GENERALLY DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM BUT I'VE NOT HEARD OF THIS IS AN ISSUE. AND I WOULD AM ASSUMING THAT YOU KNOW WITH A MODERN TECHNOLOGY MODERN. POWER GRIDTHAT I THINK WE WOULD BE PRETTY DURABLE WITH OUR- TELEPHONIC AND DIGITAL SYSTEM SO I'M I'M SAYING THAT. I JUST DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY IN REALITY IT'S GOING TO BE AS DESTRUCTIVE AS IT IS- YEAH. BUT THIS WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION FOR RURAL AND URBAN COUNTIES LIKE TO HAVE MORE MORE. OPTIONS ULTIMATELY. YOU CAN. PLEASE CHAIRMAN I MIGHT. ALL RIGHT MY BIGGEST ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH WHETHER YOU PUT THIS IN THE BROWN ACT. SUCH THAT IT IS REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND AS A CONDITION OF THE BROWN ACT THAT IF. THERE'S ANY PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE. THAT THEY HAVE TO TERMINATE THE MEETING THAT'S MY ISSUE. ON WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH WHETHER IT'S- A- PHONE LINES AND- INTERNET IS. IS FAULTY IN RURAL CALIFORNIA. I MEAN I DID COME OUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT'S FAULTY BUT- BUT THE REAL ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH. THE BROWN ACT REQUIREMENTS REQUIRE CERTAIN THINGS AND IF THIS IS IN THE BROWN ACT AND MY READING OF IT. IS SUCH THAT YOU'D HAVE TO STOP. YOUR MEETING IF YOU HAVE A FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM AND IF I'M WRONG THAT'S THE QUESTION IS AM I WRONG. IF IT NOBODY CAN TELL ME THEN I'M NOT GING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT POSITION SO THAT'S THAT'S THE ONE ISSUE THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. SORRY THANK YOU- SEVERAL MEMBERS LEADING CARRIERS FONT. OR IN YOUR CLOTHES AND CLOTHES. ARE ALWAYS ON MY CLOTHES RIGHT. IN YOUR CLOSER NOW- IN MY CLOTHES ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT A SINISTER. THANK YOU MR- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I YOU KNOW I THINK THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN SOMEONE IN GOVERNMENT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL- CONSTITUENTS FOR FOLKS FROM SAY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO CAN'T GET UP TO SACRAMENTO. MMHM EITHER BECAUSE OF A PANDEMIC OR FRANKLY BECAUSE OF MANY FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PLACE IS INHERENTLY LIMITING TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE MEANS EITHER TO HIRE A LOBBYIST OR TAKE A SOUTHWEST FLIGHT UP TO SACRAMENTO- I'M DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF YOUR LEGISLATION- THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE FIX OFF IT TO EXEMPT ITSELF. FROM THIS BILL AND I THINK I HOPE IT'S NOT A FATAL FLAW ON THIS BILL BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE THIS BECOME LAW BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT REFLECTS VERY WELL ON ON THIS BODY- AND I'M I'M I'M PLEASED THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE THIS HEARING RIGHT NOW- IN ALLOWING REMOTE PARTICIPATION- NOT FROM MEMBERS BUT CERTAINLY FROM THE PUBLIC. I THINK IT'S ENABLED THE GREATER EXPANSION OF DEMOCRACY AND I HOPE THAT CONTINUES BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR LEADERSHIP I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT THE IN LAW SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING ISSUES RETAINING THE STATE LEGISLATURE'S. ROLE IN THIS- AND SO YOU'RE LIMITED NOT JUST A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT TO LARGER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- SO ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT. YOU KNOW THE SMALLER GOVERNMENTS THE SMALLER CITIES THE SMALLER COUNTIES THOSE THE PLACES THAT IT'S EVEN HARDER TO PARTICIPATE SOMETIMES THOSE ALSO DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THAT TWENTY FIFTY THOUSAND PERSON LIMITATION WAS ADDED BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA HURT- THOSE WITHOUT ACCESS- I HOPE GOING FORWARD YOU'LL FIND SOME OPPORTUNITY OR MAYBE THIS BODY WILL FIND OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN THIS MEASURE. I THINK SENATOR JONES BROUGHT UP VERY IMPORTANT POINTS AND I THINK THERE'S IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR SOME BI PARTISAN- AGREEMENT- I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE. THE ELEMENTS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT ALLOW FOR MEMBER PARTICIPATION- FROM IN IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES- TO PERMIT IT TO PERSIST. BECAUSE I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW I CREATE WE DON'T LOSE ANYTHING WHEN I WAS. QUARANTINING AT HOME DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN PARTICIPATING THESE PROCEEDINGS FROM ZOOM- I HAD EVERY BIT AS MUCH STANDING AS ANY OTHER MEMBER. AND I THINK THAT THE TECHNICAL ISSUES CAN BE SOLVED HERE SO I HOPE THAT YOU'LL CONSIDER BOTH SUBJECTING THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES OF THESE BODIES NOT JUST THE PUBLIC TO THIS TO THIS BILL. I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND WHATEVER WHOEVER IS EXEMPTED US HOPE THEY RECONSIDER THAT PROVISION. AND I HAVE TO SAY LASTLY VERY DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THE URBAN COUNTIES TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION I ASSUME THAT MEANS INCLUDE MY OWN COUNTY IN LA- WE'VE WE'VE THRIVED WITH MAXIMUM PARTICIPATION IN LOS ANGELES. AND WE'RE TECHNOLOGICALLY CAPABLE PLACE- THAT YOU CAN CALL ON THE PHONE OR YOU CAN ZOOM IN THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OPTIONSBUT- THAT RESISTANCE TO ME IS- ALLIES ARE ARE ARE UNDERLYING- ETHOS IS AS BOTH THE COUNTY AND- AND AS A STATE SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY. RECEIVE YOUR WORK ON THIS AND I KNOW YOU'RE SORT OF YOU'RE UP AGAINST FORCES BIGGER THAN YOURSELF BUT I HOPE THAT- WE ALL KIND OF RECONSIDER. OUR TREPIDATION HERE AND- REALIZE THAT- AS I SEE MYSELF STREAMING LIVE ON A SCREEN BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT SCARY ABOUT STREAMING PUBLIC SEARCH PUBLIC PROCEEDINGS LIKE THIS AND- THIS IS FRANKLY THE FUTURE. SO. ALTHOUGH I'VE MOVED THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. ALL RIGHTY- OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES THERE WERE KELSEY. LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES WERE STUCK WITH THE FACT THAT THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUT A 210050% CAP ON IT BECAUSE OF I GUESS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL BURDEN SOME OF THIS MANDATE OULD HAVE A SMALLER COMMUNITIES BUT WE HAVE A TWO YEAR SON SAID IN THAT ALLOWS US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THIS POPULATION FLOOR. AND ALSO THE BILLS OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND I GUESS WE'LL HAVE INFORMATION HOW PEOPLE. WILL DO IT WILL PARTICIPATE HOW. THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF ANY IDEA OF HOW WE WILL ASSESS THE POPULATION FLOOR IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY HERE TO REMOTE HEARINGS GOING ON IN THESE SALLER COMMUNITIES LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. HAVE THERE WERE SOMETHING THAT THE ASSEMBLY. WHEN THEY PUT THE AMENDMENT ON YOU THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT SENATOR AND I VALUE I APPRECIATE THE POINT- YES YOU KNOW NOTHING IN THIS BILL OR EVEN EXISTING LAW NOW PRECLUDES JURISDICTIONS OF ANY SIZE OR TYPE FROM HAVING THE REMOTE OPTION I KNOW ANECDOTALLY EVEN FROM OUR DISTRICT THERE WILL BE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE SMALL CITY THAT CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE. ONLINE OR VIRTUAL POSITIONS SOME FORM SO YES THE ACCESSING OF THE DATA WILL PROBABLY NOT BE A PERFECT COMPARISON BUT THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ACTUALLY DID A REPORT I THINK LAST WEEK. AND THEY ALSO DID TALK ABOUT HOW THE ECSTASY OF VIRTUAL MEETINGS ALSO EXPANDED ACCESS SO I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE DATA POINTS I THINK SO LONG AS THEY WERE STILL LIVING IN THIS CURRENT SAID EMERGENCE WE SEE IF WE STILL AT LEAST HAVE THAT DATA POINT WHERE. IT'S MORE UNIVERSAL VIRTUAL VIRTUAL POSITION. AND THEN THERE'S THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN AN EMERGENCY MORE HAVE A COVERT HEALTH SITUATION AND THEN WHEN WE DON'T WE JUST GO ON AND WE DO THIS. AND I WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT I HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE BROWN ACT PARTICULARLY WHEN. NOW I THINK WE'RE MORE SOPHISTICATED WHEN WE POST IF A MEMBER IS GOING TO PARTICIPATE TELECOMMUNICATION OR TELEPHONE NOT TELEPHONICALLY REMOTELY. WE NOTICE IT THE PERSON IN THEIR HOTEL ROOM HAS TO PUT A SIGN UP THAT SAYS I'M PARTICIPATING THIS LITTLE CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND THEN THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO GO IN. TO YOUR ROOM SINCE IT'S NOW AN OFFICIAL AREA AND I'M WONDERING IF WE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN I MEAN. IF WE HAVE A HEALTH. PROBLEM OR HEALTH- I. WHY IN THE WORLD SOMEBODY COULD COME INTO MY HOUSE SO I GUESS IF I WAS PARTICIPATING I JUST WOULD ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME IF THAT LITTLE WRINKLE CONTINUES AND IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS WE GO INTO THE BROWN ACT HE THINKING AS WE'RE MORE SOPHISTICATED NOW THAT SEEMS STRANGE THAT WE WOULD STILL DO THAT IT'S NOT NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ANYMORE SO I'LL JUST. LEAVE THAT AS A pRHETORICAL QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I'LL JUST SAY YOU KNOW AND TO YOUR POINT SENATOR AND SENATOR STARNES POINT I THINK THERE IS MUCH TO BE MODERNIZING THE BROWN ACT EXECUTIVE ORDER BY THE GOVERNOR WAS MODERNIZATIONS DEPEND OF COURSE FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE OFFICIAL SIDE AND I INTEND TO KEEP WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- CONSTITUENCIES TO KEEP MODERNIZING THAT HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE SOME SORT OF CHANGE ON THAT FRONT. THE SORRY. FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SAYING NONE OF THEIR MOTION. OH I'M SORRY CENTER MORICHES. THANK YOU CHAIR. THIS IS A GREAT CONVERSATION I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM MY COLLEAGUES- IN THE COURSE OF- I WAS REVIEWING THIS MATTER HAVING SERVED IN. A CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS A- SUPERVISOR OREO CAPACITY- THE BROWN ACT IS A VERY REAL- SET OF OBLIGATIONS. AND NOT ONLY IS A VIOLATION. READ HAVOC IN CONSEQUENCE OF FOR THE BODY IT CAN ALSO UNDO ALL OF THE POLICY OR LEGISLATION OR DECISION MAKING THAT WAS DONE BY THAT BOARD THE CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN EXPECTATION OBLIGATIONS ARE VERY REAL- I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT I THINK. WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ATTACHED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN TWO BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SIZE OF THE CITY. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL. ISSUES TECH ISSUES THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE IN A POSITION IF IT CANNOT BE ACCOMMODATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THE STEP IN AND PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE EQUIPMENT SPECIALLY IN THESE RURAL. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE RELATIVELY SMALL BUDGETS SO I GUESS AS I'VE HEARD MY COMMENT READ THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY GREW WITH THE IDEA THAT INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST FROM THE PUBLIC BUT THOSE WHO SERVE ON A BOARD OR COMMISSION FOR A MUNICIPALITY OR COUNTY BE IN A POSITION TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL. BUT UNLESS YOU FIGURE OUT HOW THE BROWN ACT. THE UPON THIS IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT. MY CONCERN IS THAT. WE COULD BE OPENING UP A PANDORA'S BOX WITHOUT ANY REAL- SOLUTIONS. AT OUR DISPOSAL SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY YOU KNOW JUST THROW THIS OUT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. WOULD THIS NOT BE A SITUATION THAT. MORE CAN BE DONE TO SEE IF WHETHER THEY BE- MORE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS TO THE LEGISLATION AS WELL AS A BETTER ON THE SET OF DISCUSSIONS THROUGH BOTH HOUSES. TO BRING EVERYONE EXIT SIDE THIS HAS THE THIS HAS THE KERNEL OF A SIGNIFICANT BROWNBACK REFORM ACT. MAYBE MAKE THIS A TWO YEAR BILL. IS WHAT I'M ULTIMATELY GOING TO THROW OUT THERE BECAUSE IF WE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE FINAL. COMMITTEE COMMITTEE OF THIS HOUSE THIS IS GOING TO A FLOOR VOTE IF IT PASSES TODAY AND IT'S MOVING FORWARD. I MEAN SO THIS IS I DON'T THINK THE RIGHT AND THE MISSILE IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR US TO BE THROWING OUT TRULY SUBSTANTIVE. ABSENCES IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS MERITORIOUS I WANT TO GIVE YOU ABSOLUTE CREDIT. AS A FORMER LOCAL OFFICIAL THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE PANDEMIC. I THINK MORE TIME FOR THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT EVEN BETTER. I'LL JUST SAY SENATOR- THE I HAVE  LISTING THE CONVERSATION TODAY SOMETIMES I WISH I WAS ABLE TO START MY BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE OR THIS HOUSE- BUT I'D APPRECIATE ALL YOU DO IS YES I'M FOR IT BUT SINCE THIS IS HAS A SUNSET OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN EFFECT YOU KNOW WE WILL BE BACK HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR. IF THE BILL IS SIGNED- AND WE WILL KEEP WORKING AT IT AND I DO BELIEVE IT IS THE CEILING OF A GREATER PRODUCT REFORM HOPEFULLY IS I THINK TO MY KNOWLEDGE ONE OF THE FEW BROWN ACTIVE REFORM BILLS THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW AND- WE'RE HOPING TO KEEP ENGAGING ALL STAKEHOLDERS LOCAL GOV AD ACTIVISTS ALL WHOLE LIFE FOR DOWNSTATE.

DO YOU ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I DO YEAH ALL RIGHT SO- THANK YOU MR CHAIR AND SENATORS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION AND FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE AMENDMENTS I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION- THE ACLU FOR IN THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL WHILE WE WERE UNABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THEIR CONCERNS I BELIEVE WE WERE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE MAJORITY OF THEIR PRIVACY CONCERNS. AND THAT ARE THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE AMENDMENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS IN ADDITION THE CONCERNS FROM THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION- WERE BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION LATE LAST WEEK DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS I'M ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AS THE MAYOR BILL. MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR CONTAINS LANGUAGE TO SPECIFY THAT THE PROGRAM IS SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND PROHIBITS THE SALE OF DATA BY PARTICIPATING VENDORS IN THE CASE OF DIGITAL PLATES CONSUMERS HAVE A CHOICE OF DEVICES THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH GPS OR NOT WITH THE NON GPS PLATE CARRYING A LOWER PRICE POINT. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR CARRIES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE GPS MODEL BE VISUALLY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE NON GPS VERSION DIGITAL PLATES ARE NOT MANDATORY AND SHOULD THE DEVICE FAILED THE VENDOR IS OBLIGATED TO REPLACE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO NOW I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY OF. OF THESE PROGRAMS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN S. B. EIGHT OH SIX AUTHORIZE THE DMV TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION ALTERNATIVES AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE PILOT PROGRAM ALLOWED SPECIALTY PLATE OWNERS. TO RENEW THE REGISTRATION ELECTRONICALLY THROUGH DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES AND ALLOWED INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS THE REGISTRATION INFORMATION. FROM THE LICENSE PLATES APP ESTABLISHED BY THE PROVIDER. THIS PILOT PROGRAM FOUND THAT THESE ALTERNATIVE REGISTRATION. IMPROVED EFFICIENCY AT THE DMV BY ALLOWING SPECIALTY PLATE OWNERS TO RENEW THE REGISTRATION VIA AN MOBILE APP RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO INTO THE DMV. EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR WILL IMPLEMENT THE FINDINGS FOR THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION ALTERNATIVE PILOT PROGRAM BY AUTHORIZING THE DMB IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CHP. TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION CARDS DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES AND LICENSE PLATE WRAPS. TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE GYM LIGHTS REPRESENTING REVIVER. MR LIGHTS YOU'RE BUILDING YOUR NAME.

WHILE PROVIDING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS AND I JUST WANTED TO INSURE THAT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS- THIS IS- THE DIGITAL LICENSE PLATE TECHNOLOGY WAS INVENTED BY AND THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED BY- CALIFORNIA AFRICAN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS SO WHEN IT COMES TO SURVEILLANCE AND TRACKING CONCERNS WE'RE UNIQUELY SENSITIVE TO THAT AND WE STAND WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD.

HELLO ALLOWS DIGITAL PLATE AND THE RIGHT CARD YOU CAN TRY DEVICES. ELECTRONIC DEVICES CAN GATHER EXTENSIVE IMPLICATION INFORMATION ON EIGHTY EIGHT NINE THREE NINE EIGHT FOUR BUT NOT PROHIBIT UPS TRACKING WHAT THESE DEVICES NOR DOES IT REQUIRE DRIVER CONSENT TO THIS TRACKING. ONLY THAT VEHICLE OWNERS CONSENT. FOR YOU COULD BE TRACKED OR NOT AT WORK PEOPLE ARE BEATING THE MATH AND VIOLENT COULD BE TRACKED WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. BUT HE UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BASED ON THE TRACKING DEVICE IN THEIR LICENSE PLATE OR CR REGISTRATION. RECENT AMENDMENTS YOU'RE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED WE THINK VERY. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAR REGISTRATIONS COULD BE IN THE FORM OF THE MOBILE APPS THERE'S A POTENTIAL THAT THESE DIGITAL TRACKER COULD OFTEN TRACK WHERE A PERSON IS AT ALL TIMES EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT DRIVING. AS WELL AS THEIR CONTACT WHICH WEBSITES THEY VISIT AND MORE. EIGHTY EIGHT NINE EIGHT FOUR OPERATED. VERY OFTEN REQUIRES THAT THE LICENSE PLATE TO BE MORE TRACTABLE.

INDEED IT IS MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE I WANT TO ADDRESS THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN THE LATE OPPOSITION HERE BECAUSE ICE WE SPENT HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS GOING THROUGH THE DETAILS ON A. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR WHEN WAS THE CCPA THE ONE C. P. R. A. PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. WE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CONSULTING LABOR LAWYERS. TO DEAL WITH THE PRECISE ISSUE THAT WAS DISCUSSED. THE DEFINITION IN THE C. P. R. A. WHICH IS PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR WHICH WILL SOON BE THE LAW OF THE LAND. IS THAT YOUR GEO LOCATION IS SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION IS DEFINING YOUR GEO LOCATION IS ANYWHERE WITHIN TWO OR FIFTY YARDS THEY CANNOT PINPOINT YOU. THAT MEANS THAT IF YOU ORGANIZING FROM A LABOUR POINT OF VIEW AND SOMEONE WANTS TO FOLLOW YOU IN TRACK YOU THEY CAN'T. BE SUBJECT TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PENALTIES IT MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO A CLINIC TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CARE PROBLEM ORDER BOOK CLUB OF YOUR PARTICULAR SEXUAL ORIENTATION YOU CAN'T BE TRACKED IT IS DEFINED AS YOUR SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. THE UNDERLYING ISSUES EXPRESSED BY EACH OF THOSE THAT ARTICULATED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS MATTER HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE IN OUR PART OF THE LAW. TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS MEASURE EVER BECOMES LAW IT WILL ALWAYS BE SUBJECT TO. TITLE TO I MEAN PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR WHICH CAN'T BE AMENDED OUTSIDE OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AT BRIGHTS AND PRIVACY RIGHTS AS SET FORTH IN SECTION THREE OF THE MEASURE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THOSE WHO. PUT THEIR LATE OPPOSITION TO TAKE A DEEP DIVE. INTO THE HOMEWORK THAT WE DID IN PUTTING THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE THE CONCERNS THAT THEY RAISED- WHICH I RESPECT TREMENDOUSLY. AND THINK THEY'RE A 100% RIGHT. HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DIRECTED TO AND ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY PROTECTED THAT IN TERMS OF DEFINING. YOUR GEOLOCATION SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN USE SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. UNDER THE LAW IS IF IT'S SPECIFICALLY APPROVED BY THE INDIVIDUAL WHO ALLOWS THEMSELVES TO. TO PROVIDE THAT IF THEY PROVIDE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT SUBSEQUENTLY. TO REMOVE THEIR APPROVAL- AND THERE'S A SPECIFIC PROCESS TO DO SO WELL I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE SENSITIVITY IS REFLECTED. I WOULD SUGGEST AND I ONLY DO SO BECAUSE I'VE PUT JUST AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME IN. PROTECTING EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE THE RACE THIS LATE TIME AT ALL IMPACT THIS LEGISLATION ANYWAY. I OUR LAST YEAR. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IS THAT YES SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MR- VERY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION APPRECIATE THAT FROM- FROM SENATOR HERTZBERG I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF I GET THE AUTHOR JUST TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THOSE. INTERIM CONCERNS BEFORE IT IS VERY IN THAT IN THAT INTERIM PERIOD BETWEEN THE WIN WIN CCPA KICKS IN- THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT- THE EXEMPTION EXPIRES AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE GOT A- YEAR AND A HALF OR MAYBE A YEAR. PERIOD WHERE THE TRACKING WOULD BE ALLOWED- AND THEN WHEN THOSE IN IN THOSE PROVISIONS WOULD KICK IN. THEN IN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO. I JUST WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME JUST A RESPONSE TO I GUESS THE LABOR FEDERATION'S CONCERNS ON THAT IN TERMS THAT THAT ONE YEAR PERIOD IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO REMEDY THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON LANGUAGE- WITH LABOR FED AND OTHERS- TO ADDRESS THAT. RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID IT WAS A LATE OPPOSITION BUT I HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. WITH THEM- AND WE AGREED TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER ON THEIR CONCERNS. THANK YOU BUT THERE STANDING UP WE SUPPORT IN THE- SORRY- CENTER HERZBERG MOVES THE BILL I'M SORRY SENATOR ALSO. OF CLIMBING- IDEA. I DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THAT MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES HAS ON THESE ISSUES AND- I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR. HIS EXPERTISE ON THIS. I STILL THINK. THAT IT'S WORTH IT TO RAISE THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON SO MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE- AND WE NEVER KNOW WHEN. AND HOW. THIS KIND OF INFORMATION CAN BE USED WITH WORKING PEOPLE SO I'D RATHER ERR ON THE SIDE OF BEING MORE CONSERVATIVE. AND FILLING IN THESE- THESE HOLES THAN NOT AND WITH THAT I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR- AND WHEN SHE COMMITS TO WORKING ON THIS I'M SURE SHE WILL AND FOR THAT REASON. AND UNDERSTANDING HI ALL THIS IS THE CORE ISSUE. FOR WORKING PEOPLE HOW EMPLOYERS AND BUSINESSES DO USE INFORMATION THAT THEY GET OUTSIDE OF THE WORKPLACE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES AGAINST THEM BUT WITH THAT AND THOSE ASSURANCES FROM THE OFFICE AUTHOR I WILL BE SUPPORTING. PARTY THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS SEEING NONE. SEVEN MEMBER REVIEWS DO YOU CARE TO ADD TO- CENTER THERE ALSO AND SENATOR HERTZBERG'S CLOSE I WANT TO THANK BOTH THE SENATORS FOR THEIR COMMENTS- AND EDITION OF COURSE- THE SENATOR. FROM THE SOUTH WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY- ALL OF THEM- FOR THIS DISCUSSION I THINK- ITO BASED ON MY DISCUSSIONS- WITH THE OPPOSITION THEY HAVE BROUGHT A LOT OF CONCERNS AND I HAVE ASSURED THEM. YOU KNOW THAT I AM FOR PROTECTING WORKERS RIGHT I AM NOT- I WOULD NEVER INTRODUCE A BILL THAT WOULD AFFECT WORKER PROTECTIONS. I AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS I KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S TRUE I'VE ACCEPTED SIX OUT OF THE SEVEN AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REQUESTED BY THE ACLU PRIOR- TO THIS COMMITTEE AND MY HOUSE THE ONLY AMENDMENT THAT I HAVE NOT ACCEPTED IS TO BAN. THE MANUFACTURE OF AN ELECTRONIC PLATE WITH GPS TECHNOLOGY- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY DEVICES- FOR CARS THAT HAVE GPS TECHNOLOGY WE PROBABLY ALL HAVE GPS. IN OUR CARS WHEN I WAS AN ENGINEER THAT'S WHAT I WORKED ON I WORKED ON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I DESIGNED NAVIGATE TION SYSTEM. FOR CARS AND SO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY. AND WHILE THERE ARE MANY PRIVACY CONCERNS OF THIS BILL DOES CONTAIN LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND LIKE SENATOR HERTZBERG MENTIONED- ALL HIS WORK ON THIS THAT. IS WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN- YOU KNOW THOUGHT OF IN TERMS OF WORKER PROTECTIONS ARE JUST NOT JUST WORKER BUT JUST ANYONE THAT THAT IS USING ANY TYPE OF TRACKING DEVICE. R. AND SO- LIKE BUT I STILL HAVE COMMITTED TO WORKING- WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS- I FEEL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SINCE IT IS. YOU KNOW THEY ARE BRINGING LEGITIMATE PRIVACY CONCERNS THAT I AGREE WITH I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY ARE PART OF THIS BILL OR IT'S COVERED BY THE PRIVACY ACT. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE NEXT MONTH WORKING ON TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL GOING TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER. I'M AND SO- AT TODAY I'M REQUESTING YOUR I. VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU COUNSEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS. IT WAS- CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU. OKAY THIS.

FOUR GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS LIKE TO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT. AS WE ALL KNOW LAST YEAR AT THE BEGINNING OF- THIS COVER NINETY PANDEMIC- IT WAS GOVERNOR NEWSOM WHO ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT. TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED PORTIONS OF THE BROWN ACT REQUIRING IN PERSON MEETINGS AND ALLOWING MEMBERS OF A LOCAL AGENCIES ARE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ATTEND MEETINGS REMOTELY AND IN THIS LEGISLATION HERE THIS EVENING. WHICH HAS A SUNSET DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. PROPOSES TO ENACT- SOME SIMILAR- SOME PROVISIONS ALLOWING BROWN OUT ACT EXEMPTIONS FOR SOME TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS- YOU HAVE A MINUTE ANY FUTURE UP- SO PRO CLAIM STATE EMERGENCIES IN WHICH CERTAIN OFFICIALS HAVE DETERMINED THAT IN PERSON- MEETINGS. WOULD PRESENT AN IMMINENT RISK TO THE HEALTH OR SAFETY OF ATTENDEES AND SO ADDITIONALLY IN AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE PUBLIC CAN JOIN THESE MEETINGS VIA PHONE OR VIDEO CONFERENCE. UNDER THIS BILL LOCAL AGENCIES WILL NOT HAVE TO RELY ON AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT TO HOLD FULLY REMOTE MEETINGS- IF THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY EVENT EMERGENCIES THAT COULD MAKE IT PERSON MEETINGS VERY DANGEROUS OR NEAR IMPOSSIBLE- THIS LEGISLATION HAS ENJOYED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN I VOTED IN AND- I HEAR. THE CV TO- PROVIDE SOME ROOM TEST- IF HE'S STILL WITH US IS MARCUS- DID DEBT WYLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER- MARK IS THAT WHETHER IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. MY NAME IS MARK MARKET THAT WEILER I'M LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THE FDA THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. EIGHTY THREE SIXTY ONE OF THE NARROWLY CRAFTED COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO CODIFY SELECT PORTIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S MARCH TWENTY TWENTY EXECUTIVE ORDERS CONCERNING THE BROWN ACT IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE EMERGENCIES WHICH WOULD. SPECIFICALLY PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GATHERING IN PERSON. BACK IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION GRANTED TARGETED RELIEF TO PUBLIC AGENCIES OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW THE BROWN ACT RECOGNIZING THAT A SELECT FEW OF THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THE ACT. WOULD UNDERMINE EFFORTS TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAFE. THREE SIXTY ONE SIX TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO USE THE MODIFIED BROWN ACTIVE SHOOTERS USED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. IN THE EVENT OF A SIMILAR FUTURE EMERGENCY THAT IS AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. AN EMERGENCY WHICH WOULD PREVENT PEOPLE FROM. GATHERING IN PERSON SAFELY. EIGHTY THREE ONE OF NOT ONLY ABOUT THE PANDEMIC WHAT ABOUT SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR EMERGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAMPFIRE. FOR THE CITY OF PARADISE WAS DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE AND RENDERED UNSAFE TO MEET WITH THEM. THE TERMS OF THREE SIXTY ONE WHAT IF ALLOWED AGENCIES WITHIN THE CITY LIKE THE PARADISE YOUR NATION DISTRICT. TO MEET REMOTELY IN ORDER T ENSURE THE CONTINUED DELIVERY AND RESTORATION OF ESSENTIAL LOCAL SERVICES. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL INCLUDES NUMEROUS SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT OF ACCESS. THIS MODEST MEASURE WAS MADE ALL THE MORE MODEST Y AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE. NOW THE BILL'S TERMS ARE OPERABLE ONLY IN THE INSTANCES WHERE THE STATE HAS DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AS PPOSED TO INCLUDING BOTH STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION. THE BILL AS PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED ALSO HAS A TWO YEAR SUNSET PROVISION MANY OF THE BILL'S PROVISIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO REFLECTION AND EXAMINATION IN THE VERY NEAR TERM. THE EXTENT OF THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO PROVIDE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN EXPLICITLY REFERENCED AND PROTECTED WITHIN THE BILL'S PROVISIONS. AND TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTIONS ARISING BEFORE OR DURING A MEETING WHICH PRECLUDE WOULD PRECLUDE LOCAL AGENCIES FROM TAKING ACTION WITHOUT HAVING FIRST RESOLVE THE DESTRUCTION. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR A B. THREE SIXTY ONE. I WILL REMAIN ON THE LINE AWAKE AND ALERT AND LISTENING FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

GOOD EVENING MAY BEEN PLAYED WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES WE ARE OPPOSED TO MOST AMENDED JP THREE SIX ONE THANK YOU. ALREADY THANK YOU MORGAN TURNED OPPOSITE NO ONE ELSE SECOND Q. ALL RIGHT LET'S TURN OPPOSITION. ANDRES ROM ALSO ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR. KATHLEEN BURKE THE ISLAND DEAN. MR AHMOSE YES GO AHEAD THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ON THE S. ROMMEL'S LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WITH PUBLIC AND BECAUSE- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO TWO EIGHTY THREE SIXTY ONE UNLESS AMENDED. AS A NONPROFIT LAW FIRM AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORKS CLOSELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEMIC CAUSES OF POVERTY AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN PUBLIC POLICY. PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION HOUSING TRANSPORTATION EQUITY AND CLIMATE JUSTICE WE KNOW VERY WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BROWN ACT IN GUARANTEEING THAT THE VOICES OF IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE. HURTING THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THAT'S WHY WE RECKON THE IMPORTANCE OF ENSURING THAT THE BUSINESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CONTINUE. IN AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR IN EXEMPTING LOCALGOVERNMENTS FROM EXISTING PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS. WHICH MAY RESULT IN COMMUNITY MEMBERS NOT BEING ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS FOR OPENING THE DOOR FOR LOCAL AGENCIES USING PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. TO AVOID OUR OBLIGATION TO BE FULLY PRESENT AND LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IS ESSENTIAL TO PUBLIC POLICY MAKING. TO THAT AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT ANY CHANGES TO THE BROWN ARE YOU SURE ABOUT ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES WITH WHOM WE WORK. CAN CONVENIENTLY ACCESS AND FULLY PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC MEETINGS IN AN EQUITABLE MANNER. AGAIN WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS EFFORTS IN THIS AREA WE KNOW THIS BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT IT MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. UNLESS IT'S AMENDED. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON EIGHTY THREE SIXTY ONE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS PRISTINE. THE MILITARY MEMBERS CAME WHEN DEAN BUT DEFENDED ADVOCATE WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION. AS EXPECTED THE OFFICE OPENS ON THURS IN THIS COMMITTEE WE ARE REGRETTABLY OPPOSE EACH WEEK ONE LUCKY WOMAN. FATHER GOAL OF ENSURING THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES. NEED TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES DURING TIMES OF CRISIS OR EMERGENCY ABSOLUTELY LAUDABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST CONDUCT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS. OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. THE LEADING FUNDING FROM. PUBLIC PROTECTION SHOULD BE EXTREMELY RARE AND HIGHLY CERTIFIED. THE PREDICATE FOR THE LOSER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WILL JUST OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN LAST. FALL BUT IT REQUIRES THE STATE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY SUCH AS THE ONE WE'VE BEEN UNDER SINCE MARCH AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER FOR SOMETIME IN A RECOMMENDATION BY A LOCAL OFFICIAL BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF SOCIAL DIFFERENT THINGS I'VE SEEN IN SECTION ONE SUBDIVISION ONE WAY. EACH TERMS ARE UNDEFINED UNDEFINED AND QUITE VAGUE AND WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INVOKE THE EXCEPTION TO THE BROWN ACT. WITH VERY LITTLE JUSTIFICATION. ONE DIRECTION THE X. AXIS EXCEPTION IS INVOKED THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD CONDUCT BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING REQUIRED TO DO SO IN PUBLIC WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY REQUIREMENTS OF DEMOCRACY. UNFORTUNATELY EIGHTY THREE FOR TWENTY TWO FAR RIGHT SENDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM THE OBLIGATION THE BROWN ACT. AGAIN TO FIND A LOCATION EACH TELECONFERENCE OCCASION. IN FROM THE REQUIREMENT THAT TELECONFERENCE LOCATIONS BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. A WELL INFORMED AND ENGAGED COMMUNITY IS CRITICAL TO BUILDING TRUST AND REBUILDING BETTER AND THE PUBLIC ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE BROWN ACT ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN ATTEND MEETINGS IN PERSON I CAN DIRECTLY ADDRESSED MEMBERS OF GOVERNING BODY. WHAT THE REMOVING THE ABILITY IS CONTRARY TO THE BASIC TENANTS OF A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND FOR THESE REASONS PLEASE TELL YOUR CALIFORNIA ACCENT IT'S A CODE EIGHTY THREE SIX ONE. THE NUMBER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SAYING NO ONE OF THE GALLERY SEEING NO ONE ROOM ONE TWELVE ON THE PHONE LINE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION.

I HAVE NO ONE SHOWING UP ON THE PHONE PLEASE CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT- LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE CHAMBER I SEE N MICROPHONES EXCEPT FOR SENATOR STERN CENTER THERE ALSO IS IN CENTER GONZALEZ IS MICROPHONE SENATOR STERN. I SPOKE TO SOON MISTER CHAIR- OKAY A BRIEF JUST A BRIEF. COMMENT I GUESS NOT SO MUCH FOR THE AUTHOR MAYBE MORE FOR THE SPONSORS OF THE SUPPORTERS I JUST. CAN'T HELP BUT NOTE. THE SEEMING DISCONNECT HERE WE JUST HEARD A MEASURE TRY TO EXPAND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REMOTELY THAT WAS ROUNDLY OPPOSED BY EVERYONE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE THINKING OF OUR URBAN COUNTIES AND- VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOURS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. SO I'M- I'M CURIOUS FOR- AND MAYBE EXPERT- THE SPONSORS- IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR AN EMERGENCY WHY ISN'T IT. WHY ARE WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO EXTEND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION UNDER THE SORT OF BROADER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE OPPOSITION- IS ASKING FOR WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE RELUCTANCE TO HAVE THOSE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS OR- AND- RESOLVE SOME OF THOSE VAGARIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE. I DON'T FOR THE AUTHOR MAYBE TO. THE SPONSOR ON THE LINE. I ALL RIGHT SURE THIS DO YOU CARE TO TAKE THE QUESTION SURE- YOU KNOW- I DO HAVE A PATH TO THE SPONSOR ALL RIGHT. IF YOU LIKE TO WEIGH ON IT BE GREAT. THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF ACTUALLY NOT AFFECTED BY THREE THIRTY NINE. AND FOR THAT REASON WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEUTRAL POSITION ON THAT BILL- I WILL NOTE HOWEVER- THE POINTS RAISED BY SENATOR CAFIERO RELATING TO. REIMBURSEMENT AND MANDATES THAT ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE BROWN ACT. YOU CREATE THOSE. NON REIMBURSABLE MANDATES ON LOCAL AGENCIES- IT DOES- MAKES SENSE GIVEN THAT IN THE- POLICY COMMITTEE THAT IS THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. FOR THREE THIRTY NINE- IT HAD REMARKED THAT THE- TELECONFERENCING THAT WE'VE SEEN HAS NEVER BEEN BEFORE REQUIRED OF LOCAL AGENCIES OF ALWAYS BEEN PERMISSIVE. AND MANY AGENCIES STILL LACK THE EQUIPMENT STAFF AND INTERNET ACCESS ANOTHER TECHNICAL SUPPORT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNO TELEPHONIC AND INTERNET ACCESS TO THEIR MEETINGS. TO INTERPRETIVE REQUIREMENT ON TOP OF THAT WOULD POSE A PARTICULARLY COSTLY MANDATES ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. YES SENATOR STERN IF I MAY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. HOW WOULD YOU AVOID THAT WHAT YOU'RE CALLING A COSTLY MANDATE. HE WOULD HE WOULD NOT HAVE INTERPRETERS THEN IN THESE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES OR WOULD NOT. HAVE THOSE SORT OF TELECONFERENCING SERVICES. OR THAT FOR YOU WHAT IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. A TAKE ON THAT COST YOU JUST WANT THE STATE TO REIMBURSE YOU FOR. SO I WOULDN'T BE ABLE NECESSARILY TO COMMENT ON WHAT WE WOULD WANT AGAIN WERE NOT. AFFECTED BY THAT BE A TERM OF THREE THREE NINE BUT YES THE MAJOR FACTOR OF A MAJOR FACTOR OF THE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY IN OPPOSITION THREE THREE NINE- AS I UNDERSTAND IT DOES CENTER ON BE. A MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL VERSES THIS BILL WHICH HIS PERMISSION- IN NATURE. BUT WHAT I'M ASKING IS YOU WOULD YOU WOULD DEPLOY INTERPRETIVE SERVICES. IF THE IF THOSE OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED UNDER THIS LEGISLATION OR OTHER ACCOMMODATIONS TO. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IS THAT LAID OUT OR IS THAT ALL PERMISSIVE THAT'S ALL THE OPTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNDER THREE SIX ONE. THREE ONE DOESN'T SPEAK TO TRANSLATION SERVICES- AS FOR THE TRANSLATION SERVICES AS THEY EXIST AND FINALLY ALATORRE ACT THAT MAY CREATE OBLIGATIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- WHICH OPERATE GENERALLY. WHICH IS. INCLUDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDING TO THE MERGER PHYSICAL SAMPLES. SIR SIR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- JUST ADJUSTED A NOTE OF THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE SO LONG THAT CENTER BOARD IS ACTUALLY CROSS THE ISLAND ALIGN HIMSELF WITH SENATOR SKINNER THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF HOW LONG WE'VE BEEN HERE AND HOW WE WARN CENTER BOARD JUST DOWN. ALL RIGHT- SIR THERE ALSO. IF I COULD JUST AS THE- THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND TO THOSE I I'M SURE IT'S BEEN MIXED UP IN THE ANSWERS BUT THE- OPPOSITION I THINK THERE WERE FOUR. FOR CONCERNS YEAH I'D BE HAPPY ON I APPRECIATE THE LOVE ENGAGING WE'VE HAD WITH OPPOSITION YOU KNOW WE'VE- THE GAUGE OF THEM SINCE THE TIME WE INTRODUCE THE BILL WHEN THEY RAISED. THEIR CONCERNS AND WE'VE TAKEN. NUMEROUS ROUNDS OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW AND I THINK SOME OF THE REMAINING CONCERNS OR SPECIFICALLY THE REQUEST TO MANDY BOTH PHONE AND VIDEO COMMENTS OPTION. IT'S ACTUALLY A PROVISION- THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THEIR OWN SPONSORED BILL IN A. B. THREE THREE NINE AND THE SEMI LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE OF THE BROADBAND DISCREPANCIES THAT WE KNOW EXIST THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING TO RULE RESIDENCE- AND- THESE SMALLER- THESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND SO UNFORTUNATELY REQUIRING BOTH PHONE AND THESE VIDEO CONFERENCING FOR ALL MEETINGS IS NOT. TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE- FOR MANY OF THESE A SMALLER AREAS AND SO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. TRYING TO FORCE THESE TOUGH REQUIREMENTS IN ARBIL- IS- THE- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW A VERY CHALLENGING- KNOWING THAT IT'S BEEN AMENDED OUT OF THEIR BILL AND SO CERTAINLY JUST. YOU KNOW AS WAS MENTIONED HI THIS IS A BILL THAT HAS. BEEN YOU KNOW NARROWLY TAILORED- IN THE SENSE THAT. IN ORDER FOR. THIS TO BE UTILIZED THERE HAS TO BE ONE A PROCLAMATION OF A STATE EMERGENCY. AND THEN- FURTHER A LOCAL- A DETERMINATION BY A MAJORITY VOTE. TWO TWO THAT THAT THAT. SPECIFICALLY STATES THE OTHER RESULT OF THIS EMERGENCY. THAT A MEETING A PERSON WILL PRESENT AN IMMINENT RISK TO HEALTH OR SAFETY OF ATTENDEES AND SO IT'S EXTREMELY NARROW. IN SCOPE- TO REALLY FOCUS ON- YOU KNOW A LOCAL EMERGENCY AS WE EXPERIENCE AMID THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU ON THE SECOND HOUSE. YES THANK YOU- TO THE AUTHOR AND MAY I HAVE THE SAME QUESTIONS AS US SENATOR ASAL- YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME SOMETHING TO ADD THAT COULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW BEST EFFORTS COULD BE MADE IF SOMEONE DOES HAVE GOOD BROADBAND BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT OF NOT HAVING THAT ACCESS. FOR PHONE AND VIDEO BUT IF YOU DO HAVE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT AVAILABLE TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC- SO JUST YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT THE OTHER- COMPONENT WHICH I DON'T KNOW HAD BEEN ADDRESSED BUT IT WAS- IN THE BILL HAD MENTIONED THAT THIS PROVISION WILL ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE BODY TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY HAVING. WITHOUT HAVING TO POST OUR HOME ADDRESS WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND. OR AT THE ADDRESS OF WHATEVER LOCATION FROM WHICH THEY ARE PARTICIPATING SO. I CAN SEE WHERE MAYBE THERE'S SOME DISTRUST AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE THE PUBLIC MAY THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE THANK YOU. YOU KNOW ARE NOT IN THE JURISDICTION THAT USE. SHOULD BE IN- THE WHILE VOTING REQUIRED TO HAVE A QUORUM IN THE JURISDICTION SO JUST SOMETHING ELSE I'M THINKING ABOUT BUT I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- YOU KNOW OPPOSITION ON THIS AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY NARROW SCOPE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YO. ALL RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS- SEEING NONE IS OUR MOTION. SENATOR CAFIERO MOVES THE BILL- WE CARE CLOSE. I'M SORRY.

FORTY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP LATE WITH US. SO REMEMBER RODRIGUEZ FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB THREE SIXTY FOUR THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT ALL OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS. WHO COME TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK RECEIVE COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTIONS FROM WELL DOCUMENTED DECEITFUL PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTY FOREIGN LABOR RECRUITERS. AB THREE SIXTY FORT WORTH CORRECT A DRAFTING ERROR MADE AN SP FOUR SEVEN SEVEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT CREATED THE FIRST FRAMEWORK OF COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTIONS FOR TEMPORARY VISA HOLDERS BY pAGRICULTURAL WORKERS. AMONG ALL TYPES OF BASES THE H. TWO A. PROGRAM VISA PROGRAM THE TEMPORARY VISA CALORIE LINK TO THE LARGEST NUMBER OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. NEWLY RELEASED DATA FROM THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE SHOWS THAT OUR CULTURE WORKERS WITH H. TWO A. VISA REPORTED 70% MORE CASES OF TRAFFICKING. AND EXPLOITATION DURING THE PANDEMIC AND AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THESE WORKERS ALSO REPORTED BEING DENIED MEDICAL ATTENTION AMONG OTHER USES WHAT THEY WERE DEEMED ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES BY UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTS. THESE ARE JUST TOOK JUMP EXAMPLES OF THE WAYS IN WHICH OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS BOTH FEDERALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA. DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THESE WONDERFUL TEMPORARY MIGRANT WORKERS ENTERING CALIFORNIA. DURING THE SERVICES OF FOREIGN LABOR RECRUITERS. THE BILLS INCREASE PROTECTION WOULD JUST DO THAT FOLLOWING THE LAST COMMITTEE'S HEARING. OPPONENTS SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO FIND A COMPROMISE. MY OFFICE REACH OUT BUT THEY REFUSED TO OFFER LANGUAGE. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ONLINE HOPEFULLY STILL THERE STEPHANIE RICHARD REPRESENTING THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING WHO CAN SPEAK.

I REMEMBER HOW EXCITED I WANT THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD. HAVE REALLY HELPED ME AND WOULD PROTECT. ARE THERE ANY DIDN'T WORKERS LIKE ME I WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I HEARD THAT. THE DEAL WOULD ONLY COVER EACH TO BE WORKERS BECAUSE OF INTERESTING A. R. I DIDN'T COME TO THE UNITED STATES ON H. TWO B. VISAS. I CAME IN AND P. ONE VISA AN IT WAS BECAUSE OF HOW CONFUSING DEFEATS THE PROCESS WAS THAT THEY ENDED UP TRAFFIC. I NEED TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE LENGTH THE STORE WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD CHAT. IN THE PHILIPPINES IS LIKE WINNING THE LOTTERY. AND I GET MY VISA. I WAS EXCITED AND I DIDN'T ASK MANY QUESTIONS. I CAME TO CALIFORNIA WITH A RECRUITER BUT MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE. THE E. ONE VISAS. AND WE BELIEVE. WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LEGALLY WORK IN THE UNITED STATES. WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE UNITED STATES MY PASSPORT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. AND I WASN'T GIVEN A CONTRACT OR THE TERMS OF MY EMPLOYMENT BEFORE I LEFT MY HOME COUNTRY. I WAS TOLD A- TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MY TRANSPORTATION. THE UNITED STATES AND IF HE'S- SUPPOSED TO HAVE TO WAIT TEN YEARS. AT A TIME AND HOPEFULLY EARLY EDUCATED IN LOS ANGELES AT THE OFFICE THAT. I WORKED. EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY WITH NO DAY OFF.

YEAH I HOPE ARE YOU WHAT ARE YOU IN EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT. STEPHANIE RICHARD. STEPHANIE RICHARD I'M TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING THE SPONSOR MAYBE THREE SIX FOUR CASTLE THE LARGEST LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE PRIOR FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND UNITED STATES. BASED ON FORECAST MODELS WRITERS APPEARANCE WORKING A TRAFFICKING VICTIMS YOU LEARN THAT ONE OF THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT TRAFFICKING BEFORE IT. WAS TO LIMIT THE FRAUDULENT PRACTICES A THIRD PARTY FOR LABOR CONTRACTORS AT THE TIME OF WORKER RECRUITMENT. TRAFFICKING IS THE DIFFICULT CRIME TO VENT BUT THE DAY WE CAN PROTECT THE VULNERABLE WORKERS AT THE PORT SEVEN SEVEN REQUIREMENTS AS CLARIFIED BY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR OR CRIME SO PROTECTING ALL TEMPORARY WORKERS COMING TO CALIFORNIA. MUCH OF THE DEBATE AROUND EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR FOCUSES ON THE H. TWO A. AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ONLY ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE WORKERS- THE BILL WAS DESIGNED FOR THAT SO WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE OTHER VISA CATEGORIES THE BILL COVERS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS. EVIDENCE SHOWS. THAT HOUSTON SUFFERED BY WORKERS RECRUITED BY FOREIGN LABOR CONTRACTORS AT THE SCENE YOU REGARDLESS OF THE CATEGORY FOR THAT REASON THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR. THE WHOLE WAY BEYOND THOSE EXISTING IN CALIFORNIA OR FEDERAL LAW THEY PROVIDE A SORELY NEEDED ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK COVERING ALL THE THREE CATEGORIES ONE THAT MATCHES WELL BUT DOES NOT OVERLAP WITH EXISTING PROTECTIONS. THE BILL PROVISIONS ARE ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS EMPLOYERS WILL NOT HAVE A VETTED LIST OF LEGITIMATE RECRUITERS THAT THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DIRECTLY RECRUIT THEIR OWN TEMPORARY WORKERS. AND UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THE BUSINESSES USING RECRUITING UNDERPAY WORKERS WILL BE ELIMINATED. THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT THIS IS DOUBLE LIFE CONVENIENTLY THANK YOU MR.

GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR- THIS IS MATTHEW ALLEN WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION I WILL KEEP MY SYSTEM WHEN YOU BREATHE IN A LATE HOUR. WE ARE OPPOSED TO EIGHTY AT THREE FIFTY FOUR- SIMPLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE FIND IT A DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING LAW- BONIVA CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA IN. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAVE TO BE REGISTERED UNDER THE- FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR LOG THAT IS THROUGH THE LABOR COPPER LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. AND THIS- REGULATION WOULD BE DUPLICATIVE TO THAT IT WOULD SUBJECT- ARE POSTED TO LICENSING RESTRICTIONS- THAT- THE JUDGE WILL BE COVERING THE SAME THING AND SO. FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. ALSO BRIAN LITTLE. BEING A TEACHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M QUITE A LITTLE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST ORGANIZATION OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB THREE SIXTY FOUR BECAUSE ALL OPPOSED TO CLICK A REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS TO PARTICIPATE WITH FEDERAL H. TWO A. TEMPORARY CULTURAL WORKER VISA PROGRAM AND FURNITURE CULTURAL PULLEYS ON MANY CALIFORNIA FARMS THE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS HAVE FOR DECADES BEEN REQUIRED TO CLEAN AND MAINTAIN. THE STATE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS LICENSE WHICH REQUIRES FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE AND SATISFACTION BUT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH NUMEROUS IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES INCLUDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR THEIR PERSONNEL PUT YOU AWAY TO BOND FOR CONTRACTORS SEEKING INITIAL LICENSES EXPECTED IT'S CRUCIAL ACQUIREMENT CONTINUING EDUCATION PROPEL SEES SEEK RENEWAL OF THEIR LICENCES EIGHTY THREE SIXTY FOUR IS AN UNNECESSARY EXPANSION THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENT THE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS ALREADY LICENSED BONDED AND SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE EDUCATION ON THE COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS AND MONITORING BY THE OFFICE.

THANK YOU CHAIR BOY IT HAS BEEN ONE HECK OF A DAY- THE GROUP THAT THAT WOULD NINE HOUR MARKER SO- FIVE RISE. IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL ONLY BECAUSE AND I THINK SOME FOLKS THAT ARE YOUR TICKET LATER SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THE- THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS BILL SEEMS MERITORIOUS I MEAN WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE REDUCE OR IDEALLY ELIMINATE TRAFFICKING- IN ORGANIZED CRIME THAT GOES ALONG WITH- THAT ELICIT- ENTERPRISE. THE ISSUE IS WHAT EXACTLY IS NOT WORKING WITH THE TWO OTHER EXISTING REGISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE. OUR REGION IS THAT WE HAVE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE RIGHT NOW. IN ADDING THAT THIRD. YOU'RE WELCOME CLIENTS- I THINK WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF WE IMPROVED IF NECESSARY. THE EXISTING STATE REGISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE- REGIME RATHER THAN CREATE A THIRD ONE SO I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE CAN BE IMPROVEMENTS IN WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AFTER THE WELFARE OF THOSE THAT ARE WORKING IN THIS COUNTRY- BECAUSE WE RELY ON THEM SO MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT THEY CONTRIBUTE TO. OUR INDUSTRY. BUT AT SOME POINT I MEAN. WHEN YOU HAVE THREE SEPARATE REGIMES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IN MANY RESPECTS THE SAME THING- I DON'T SEE. WHY IT COULD BE TERRIBLY USEFUL. AND I THINK WITH THAT I WOULD- RESPECTFULLY LET THE AUTHOR KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE WHAT HE'S DONE BUT- WE TALK ABOUT THE REGULATORY. AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL ARE IN POSITIONS ON ENTERPRISE WE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE DROUGHT AND DISEASE THE OVERALL CONDITIONS WE'VE EXPERIENCED RECOVERED- AND WHAT HAVOC THAT IS READ ON OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WE ARE HELD TO HIGHER STANDARDS IN THE WORLD. IN THESE AREAS OF REGULATION AND WELFARE AND LABOR- I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD NECESSARILY LOOK UPON WHAT IS OCCURRING AS SOMETHING THAT IS INHERENTLY FAULTY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE FEDERAL AND STATE. REGISTRATION REGIMES THAT CAN SATISFY THESE CONCERNS SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU- CENTER MORICHES ALL RIGHT. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES RAISED- IS THERE A MOTION. YES SIR WHY CAL SKI MOVES THE BILL. THERE GOES ALL RIGHT- SIMPLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ DO YOU CARE TO CLOSE YES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL MARTIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGING COUNSEL TO CALL THE ROLL THIS IS EIGHTY THREE SIX FOUR BY A FAMILY MEMBER OVER THE WEEKEND WITH A MOTION BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.

WERE OPPOSED BY PLACEMENT AGENCIES. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS BILLS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE EIGHTY FOUR NINETY NINE- SPONSORED BY PLACEMENT AGENCIES AND PROVIDES FOR NO-OVERSIGHT WHATSOEVER. AND WHILE THAT DOES INCLUDE A HANDFUL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE MAJORITY OF SAFEGUARDS IN THE PREVIOUS BILL. EIGHTY FOUR NINETY NINE IS NOT A CONSENSUS BILL NOR A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL. WHAT THE AMENDMENTS RABBIT REMEDY SOME KEY PROBLEMS DIRECT YOU CRITICAL ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. FIRST EIGHTY FOUR NINETY NINE OUT OF TEN REQUIREMENT TO HOLD REFERAL SORTERS SERVER EXCUSE RESOURCES ACCOUNTABLE. THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN CURRENT LAW. UNNECESSARY DETRIMENTAL.
