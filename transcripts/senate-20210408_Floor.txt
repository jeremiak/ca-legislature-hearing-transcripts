CANCER PATIENTS LIKE GRACE STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THE BEST TREATMENTS AND CURES MADE POSSIBLE BY ADVANCES IN CANCER SCIENCE. IN THE THANK YOU VALLEY WE ARE EXTREMELY LUCKY TO HAVE CITY OF HOLES IN OUR BACKYARD. CYDIA HOPE AND OTHER CANCER RESEARCH CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CONDUCTING CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH TESTING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS AND CURES. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY CANCER PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. STRUGGLE TO ACCESS THOSE LIFESAVING MIRACLES THE BEST CHANCE OF THE CURE IS THE FIRST CHANCE OF UP HERE.

GOOD MORNING PHIL MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR ELEVEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN I WAS EXCITED AND HONORED TO BE RUNNING FOR STATE ASSEMBLY MY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN CANCER. I IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE CAMPAIGN TO FOCUS ON HIS CARE AND TO BE WITH HIM AND MY MOTHER. AND I DUG THROUGH THE COMPLICATED AND RAPIDLY ADVANCING. WORLD OF MODERN CANCER CARE SCARING FOR CLINICAL TRIALS THAT MIGHT HELP HIM. I BEGAN TO LEARN ABOUT IMMUNOTHERAPY GENETIC SEQUENCING AND INTEGRATED CANCER CARE MANY THINGS THAT WERE NOT STANDARD OF CARE AT THE TIME. WITHOUT A LAB IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE GET A FULL GENOME AND EXOME SCREENING. RATHER INEXPENSIVELY AND THEN LITERALLY FOUGHT WITH OUR BRAIN SURGEON ABOUT ACCESS TO THE TISSUE SAMPLES. WE ENDED UP EVENTUALLY PURSUING SIMILAR LIMITED SEQUENCING AND WE PURSUED A RATHER NOVEL APPROACH AND MY FATHER WAS ACTUALLY HAVING QUITE A BIT OF SUCCESS IN HIS BATTLE WITH CANCER WHEN HE EVENTUALLY DIED FROM A BLOOD CLOT. THESE ADVANCES HAVE GOTTEN MORE ORE PROMISING. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE SENSIBLE. A FRIEND PASSED AWAY RECENTLY ATTENDED AND JOURNAL MEMORY FOR A FOR FROM CANCER. HE WAS A VET AND HE THOUGHT HE COULDN'T GET THE INNOVATIVE CARE THAT HE WANTED AT THE VA AND SO WE TURN TO GO FUND ME. WHICH IS A PLACE TO OFTEN NOW THAT IS WHERE PEOPLE GO TO FIND THAT MEDICAL CARE IN OUR COUNTRY. SIR BELIEVE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THESE CUTTING EDGE THERAPIES ARE ACCESSIBLE.

NOW SENATOR MEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THE MORNING MEMBER SORRY FOR JUMPING THE GUN. I'M HONORED THIS RISE TO SPEAK IN RECOGNITION OF SR TWENTY TWO COMMEMORATING NO RUSE. NO ROSE CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AND TRANSLATED INTO TWO WORDS MEANING NEW DAY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MILLIONS OF IRANIAN AMERICANS AND OTHERS WHO OBSERVE THIS DAY EACH YEAR AT THE VERNAL EQUINOX. CELEBRATION FOCUSES ON THE REBIRTH AND RENEWAL THAT COMES WITH THE PASSING OF ANOTHER YEAR. IT BEGINS AT THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING IS WIDELY ENJOYED THROUGH A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT REFLECT THE FRESH BEGINNINGS OF THE NEW YEAR- AND SO THERE'S THE JUMPING OF FIRE ON THE TUESDAY BEFORE THE EQUAL KNOCKS. THE SHAKING OF THE HOUSE OR HOUSE CLEANING THAT'S MEANT TO WASH AWAY THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND NO RUSE AT ITS HEART IS ABOUT BRINGING TOGETHER THE IDEALS OF PEACE RESPECT UNITY AND THE SHARED GOAL OF A FRUITFUL NEW YEAR. THIS NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATION CONNECTS PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES AND RELIGIONS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD.

SEEING NONE IS THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. MEMBERS ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIFTY THREE. SENATOR HERTZBERG. ARE YOU PREPARED. HE IS PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY SEVEN BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACTUAL LEADING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY. SENATOR HERTZBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW. I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE HAVE- DISCUSSED IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT OVER THE YEARS DEALING WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY PARTICULARLY SOLAR ENERGY. ONE OF THOSE AREAS OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO SOLAR IS INFORMED BY PROPOSITION SEVEN THAT WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY WHICH EXEMPTED. NEW NEWLY CONSTRUCTION ON THE DEFINITION OF PROPERTY TAX FOR PURPOSES OF SOLAR. FEDERAL TAX LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX CREATED INVESTMENT TAX STRUCTURE. THAT CREATED WHAT'S CALLED THE PARTNERSHIP FLIP. IN THESE CLIPS BASICALLY ALLOW INVESTORS TO GET THE TAX BENEFITS UNTIL THEY HIT A CERTAIN NUMBER AND THEN TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP THESE ARE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE AND FORMER THE VERY OUTSET OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO DEAL WITH THE TAX STRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH THE EXEMPTIONS AND THE LIKE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HAS CAUSED SOME CONFUSION BY PRODUCING. CERTAIN GUIDELINES THAT PROVIDE CONTRADICTORY DIRECTION BUT THE CHANGE OF OWNESHIP WOULD OCCUR IF THERE WAS MORE THAN 50% BUT- CHANGE OF THAT OWNERSHIP. SO THIS MEASURE TO GIVE CLARITY AND CONFIDENCE TO THE ROBUST SOLAR MARKET THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IN CALIFORNIA AVOIDS THAT CONFUSION AND COULDN'T GET HOPEFULLY INSPIRES THE- THE FOLKS TO CONTINUE TO INVEST TO DOUBLE DOWN ON INVESTMENT IN SOLAR ASK YOUR- VOTE THANK YOU. SAN DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I IF I COULD I HAVE A QUESTION OF OFFER SCREEN TO THE TICKET QUESTION CERTAINLY. TO THE CHAIR YEAH SO- BUT MY QUESTION IS- SOLAR SYSTEMS DO NOT IT PAY LOCAL COUNTY TAXES AND SO WITH THIS- THEN IT UP- AND SECURE ROLE SO THOUGH THOSE TAXES TYPICALLY GO. TO THE COUNTIES IN THE AREAS WHERE THESE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT AND THOSE ARE TAXES THAT HELP- FIND LAW ENFORCEMENT- JUVENILE JUSTICE ALL THOSE THINGS THAT- COUNTIES PROVIDE AND THERE HAS BEEN EXEMPTION SO WHEN THIS CHANGES- OVER DOES THAT DOES THAT MONEY GO TO THE COUNTIES OR TO GO BACK TO THE INVESTORS- WHICH WE CAN GIVE ME SOME CLARIFICATION ON. WHAT HAPPENS HERE YES CERTAINLY. WELL TO THE CHAIR RIGHT NOW SINCE THE VOTERS PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THIS- EXCLUSION OF ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED. DEFINITION FROM PROPERTY TAX THAT THAT'S THAT'S BEEN THE RULE FOR SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. THIS IS ONLY THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW OLD THE CONSTRUCT OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE- FEDERAL INVESTOR TAX CREDIT. HAS BEEN FORMED THROUGH THESE TRANSACTIONS. AND SO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS CHANGING THAT SO THERE'S NO ISSUE ABOUT DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN FLOWING. TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS UNDER THE PROPERTY TAX DISTRIBUTION AT ALL THE ONLY QUESTION IS WILL THAT CHANGE GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO ADOPT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION'S GUIDELINES AND INTERPRETATION. AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT THE PEOPLE THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND THIS LEGISLATURE IS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. PRIORITIZE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THIS AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THOSE INSTRUMENTS OF GOVERNMENT ARE ACTING CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENT AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE PEOPLE. AND IT SHOULDN'T AFFECT A NICKEL TO ANYBODY. EXCEPT INCREASE MORE INVESTMENT MORE RATE OF RETURN AND MORE SOLAR ENERGY. BEING PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE SENATOR HERTZBERG- SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR CORKTOWN- THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY IS BEEN. PASSING A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CONSTITUTE FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY- PROPERTY TRANSFERS FROM- REASSESSMENT AND I THINK THE CONCERN HERE IS WE'VE WE'RE EXPANDING IT TO FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS IF I'M READING THIS CORRECTLY WHICH- KIND OF REPLICATE SIDE THE INFAMOUS DALE SITUATION- WITH THE HOTEL IN- LOS ANGELES WHERE THE COUNTY LOST ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE THEY STRUCTURE THE TRANSACTION. SO THAT NO ONE ON MORE THAN 50% OF TE- PROPERTY WAS OWNED COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS IS NOT LIKE THAT BECAUSE THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION THAT WERE SPEAKING OF IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY IS ADDING PEOPLE SO NO ONE OWNS YOU KNOW MORE THAN 50% AND I THINK THAT'S THE WE DON'T LIKE TO CALL IT A LOOPHOLE WE LIKE TO CALL IT A- AND M. MISINTERPRETATION. OF WHAT OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP SO A LITTLE MORE EXPLANATION ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR LEGISLATURES TAKING A POSITION TO ACTUALLY EXAMS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE COUNTED. AS CHANGE OF OWNERSHIPS. THAT COULD BE HAPPENING AT SIX AND- COMPLETELY. OPPOSED IN THE MICHAEL DELL SITUATION THE HOTEL OF THE TO THE CORNER OF WILSHIRE BOULEVARD AND- OCEAN IN SANTA MONICA WAS OWNED BY PERSON A- THEY HELD IT IN THE CORPORATION. BOTH THE BUILDING AND THE LAND WAS HELD IN THE CORPORATION WHEN MICHAEL DELL PER PURCHASE THAT PROPERTY HE PURCHASED THE CORPORATION A THE PROPERTY WAS NOT REASSESSED IN THAT TRANSACTION BECAUSE THAT WAS NO TRANSFER OF THE REAL ESTATE IN THAT LOOPHOLE JUST THE TRANSFER OF THE CORPORATE SHARES. THAT HAPPENS SUBSEQUENT IN TIME. THIS TRANSACTION IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. ON THE DAY YOU ENTER INTO TRANCE. FIRST IT'S INFORMED BY PROPOSITIONS SEVEN THAT WAS PASSED BY THE PEOPLE. SO THAT THEY CREATED THE EXEMPTION ALREADY EXISTED. THE NATURE OF THE DISCUSSION IS THE PARTNERSHIP FLIP WHEN YOU PUT THE MONEY DOWN HAPPENS ON DAY ONE IT WASN'T A SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTION AND ON DAY ONE IT'S JUST FACILITATES THE ABILITY FOR THE PARTIES TO GET THE BENEFIT OF A ROBUST INVESTMENT ON THE ONE HAND YET FULLY ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF THE TAXES. THAT HELP INFORM AND REDUCE THE PRICE AND COST OF THE PARTICULAR TRANSACTION SO IT REALLY IS NOT COMPARE OF ALL AT ALL ONE IS HAS TO DO WITH THE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION THIS HAS TO DO WITH A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE AND ACTIVISTS ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED AND ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IS TO AVOID THE CONFUSION IN THE MARKET PLACE CAUSE BY THE BOARDOF EQUALIZATION PROVIDING COUNTRY GUIDELINES FOR THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY OUR IN COUNTRYTO THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND COUNTRY TO THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN SENATOR HERTZBERG IS THAT YOUR CLOSER WOULD YOU LIKE THAT'S IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IN THE CAPITAL IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE WERE BLESSED TO HAVE TEN HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS ARE SHARING THEIR STORIES HERE IN SACRAMENTO. BUT WE TYPICALLY BRING SURVIVORS UP TO SACRAMENTO EVERY YEAR FOR TWO REASONS- TO HONOR THEIR LEGACY AND THE SACRIFICE THE SACRIFICE OF THOSE WE LOST AND BECAUSE THEY SERVE AS A LIVING REMINDER OF THE IMPACT OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE LET BIGOTRY GO UNCHECKED. WHEN SURVIVORS SHARE THEIR HEART WRENCHING STORIES THEY OPEN THE MOST INTIMATE WINDOW INTO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T SPEAK OUT AGAINST HATE AND BIGOTRY THESE ARE STORIES THAT ANYONE OF CONSCIENCE CANNOT IGNORE. OVER QUICKLY LOSING THE FINAL GENERATION OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS- INDEED COVERT NINETEEN TRAGICALLY HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY DEVASTATING IN TWENTY TWENTY COVER NINETEEN TOOK THE LIVES OF NINE HUNDRED HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. LIVING IN ISRAEL ALONE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AROUND THE WORLD THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT OPPORTUNITIES TO HEAR FROM SURVIVORS IS SO VITAL WE NEED TO BE THE BEARERS OF THEIR STORIES WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER. AROUND TO TELL THOSE STORIES. SADLY HOLIC IGN IS GROWING AT. RATES WITH TWO THIRDS OF AMERICAN MILLENNIALS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ELSE THAT'S IS. A NEARLY A QUARTER UNSURE IF THEY HAVE EVEN HEARD ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOLOCAUST DENIALISM IS GROWING WITHIN THE INFORMATION VACUUM AND SO TOO IS WHITE SUPREMACY. IN FACT OUR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY CEREMONY IN THIS BUILDING TWO YEARS AGO TOOK PLACE JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING AT THE HOMEPOD SYNAGOGUE. IN AND PULL AWAY AND SO MONTHS THE DAY. AFTER THE COULD. SENATE MASS. IT WAS AND SOBERING REMINDER. THAT THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST ARE EVER PRESENT TODAY. SINCE THEN WE HAVE MEANT THAT WE HAVE WITNESSED MORE MURDEROUS ATTACKS ON AMERICAN JEWS IN JERSEY CITY- AND MANZI. I WITH RECORD LEVELS OF ANTI SEMITIC ATTACKS NATIONWIDE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT HATRED IS NEVER ISOLATED TO ONE GROUP. TESTIS COUNTLESS LGBTQ PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- ROMA AND SINTI PEOPLE WERE ALSO MURDERED BY THE **** ALONG SIDE SIX MILLION JEWS. WE HAVE SEEN SIMILAR SPIKES IN WHITE SUPREMACIST AND HATE MOTIVATED VIOLENCE TARGETING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS MUSLIMS AND LGBTQ PEOPLE AND OUR COUNTRY IN RECENT YEARS. I'M PERHAPS MOST PRESENT OF MINE FOR MANY OF US A YEAR'S WORTH OF HARMFUL LANGUAGE FROM OUR HIGHEST LEADERS ON DOWN HAS INCITED A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN VICIOUS ATTACKS TARGETING. THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO COVERED PROTOCOLS- WE ONCE AGAIN CANNOT HAVE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS WITH US THIS YEAR. INSTEAD WE ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO PERSONALIZE TODAY'S CEREMONY IN A DIFFERENT WAY COLLEAGUES- WE HAVE PROVIDED EACH OF YOU WITH A PRINTED TWEET FROM THE OFFICIAL ELSE FITS MEMORIAL TWITTER PAGE AND IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING UP PAGE.

IF YOU HAVEN'T GRABBED IT ALREADY YOUR FRAMES PHOTO OF THAT TWEET IS WAITING FOR YOU AT THE TABLE ACROSS FROM THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS. AS YOU'LL NOTICE THE TWEET TELLS THE STORY OF A VICTIM OF THE HOLOCAUST WHO SHARES YOUR BIRTHDAY. A SMALL WINDOW INTO THE DEVASTATION THAT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND. REPRESENTING EACH OF OUR BIRTHDAYS COLLEAGUES AS YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURES OF THOSE WHO LOOK WHO WE LOST PLEASE ALSO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING A C. R. TWENTY NINE TO HONOR ND REMEMBER ALL OF THE HOLOCAUST VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS AND TO USE THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS- SPHERE OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I'M HONORED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR TWENTY NINE TO ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA'S HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND SINCE- SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRING THIS FORWARD. THE HOLOCAUST WAS- THE DARKEST LESSON OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND SHOULD NEVER B FORGOTTEN THIS RESOLUTION REMINDS US TO LEARN FROM OUR HISTORY TO ENSURE THAT THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS NEVER ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND UNFORTUNATELY IS MY GOOD FRIEND THAT'S POINTED OUT TO ME PEOPLE. DO NOT KNOW. THIS STORY ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THOUGH THE HOPE AND STRENGTH AND COURAGE AS NEEDED FROM ALL OF US TO OPPOSE INJUSTICE. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND TE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER ATTORNEYS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF WORKING IN SOLIDARITY AND SPEAKING OUT AGAIN IN THE FACE OF BIGOTRY AND HATRED. DO AS AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS OF STOOD WITH ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES TO EDUCATE FUTURE AND THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS OF THEINJUSTICES OF THE JAPANESE AND AMERICAN INTERNET. TO HELP COMBATANTI MUSLIM POLICIES THAT SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE FACE FACE ARISE AND HATE INCIDENTS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF MANY EXAMPLES WE MUST STAND UNITED ACROSS ALL FAITHS AND BACKGROUNDS AND WORK TOGETHER BY SPEAKING OUT FOR PEACE. NOW HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS TEACH US IT STARTED WITH WORDS. IT STARTED WITH WORDS DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE THE PEOPLE. MUST HOLD ACCOUNTABLE ORGANIZATIONS AND CORPORATIONS TO PERMIT TO FLORES. I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH THE WITH A QUOTE FROM A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR- ILLY ZELL HE SAID. PERMISSION TO READ. PROVED YES WE MUST ALWAYS TAKE SIDES. NEUTRALITY HELPS THE OPPRESSOR NEVER THE VICTIM SILENCE ENCOURAGES THE TORMENTOR NEVER THE TORMENTED. SOMETIMES WE MUST INTERFERE ESPECIALLY ASKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A C. R. TWENTY NINE THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. C. R. TWENTY NINE. ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN AS A MEMBER OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE A DAY IN HISTORY. WHAT THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY IS ASKING US TO DO IS TO PUT OURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE. THE JEWISH PEOPLE WHO WORKS TRIPPED FROM THEIR HUMANITY. ENTIRE FAMILIES DESTROYED PEOPLE NOT KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR LOVED ONES. IT'S ABOUT ALLOWING OURSELVES TO FEEL THE AGONY. OF THE PEOPLE WHO FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT WERE PLUCKED FROM SOCIETY HUMILIATED STARVED BEATEN. DEHUMANIZED THEIR NAMES STRAIGHT AND WITHOUT MERCY EXECUTED. JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JEWISH. THE WOMEN EXPERIENCES PARTICULARLY VERY PAINFUL FOR ME AND I'M SURE MANY OF MY FEMALE COLLEAGUES. I IMAGINE COUNTLESS MOTHERS BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN. MANY OF THEM JUST INSTANCE BEYOND HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR OWN WELL BEING HAVING TO WORRY WHERE THEIR CHILDREN WERE. ARE THEY CRYING BY THE FED IS SOMEONE HURTING THEM. AND EVEN WORSE JUST WARNING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT KEEP THEM SAFE. THEY HAVE TO HAVE EXPERIENCED DESPERATION. WONDERING IF THEY WERE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THAT THEY WOULD EVER SEE THEIR CHILDREN AGAIN. AS A TEACHER I HAD LESSON PLANS THAT REQUIRED MY STUDENTS TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE HOLOCAUST. ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY WOULD ALWAYS FIND WAS EXTENSIVE RECORDS. OF DIARIES AND NOTES FROM CHILDREN. AND THE CURRENT TEAM AND THESE DIARIES. WAS A YEARNING FOR EDUCATION TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL AND TO JUST FEEL THE SENSE OF NORMALCY THAT THEY ONCE HAD. IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN HOW DISTRAUGHT OUR CHILDREN OUR FAMILIES AND EVEN OURSELVES HAVE BEEN WITH THE PANDEMIC. NOW IMAGINE FOR US IT WAS JUST ONE YEAR. SAFE IN OUR HOMES FORTY FAMILIES THE LIVING CONDITIONS WERE HORRIFIC AND THE AGONY AND THE PAIN. AND IMAGINABLE. YET WE HAVE IN THE PAST. AS A NATION ALLOW TRANSGRESSIONS AGAINST SPECIFIC GROUPS. AND THE KERN RICE OF HATE AND MISINFORMATION IN OUR SOCIETY AND MOST RECENTLY AGAINST OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THE API COMMUNITY REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. IT WAS PEOPLE ACTING ON I. DS AND HATEFUL RHETORIC LEADING THEM TO ULTIMATELY DO HUMAN NICE. OTHER HUMAN BEINGS. THAT'S WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT. TO REMIND US THAT WE ARE ONLY HUMAN AND THAT WE HAVE TO CONCOCT DAILY WORK AT KEEPING OURSELVES FROM ACTING ON OUR WORSE IMPULSES EVERY DAY WE HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS A BETTER COUNTRY. AND A BETTER WORLD AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. POLITICI THANK YOU. SENATOR DRAWS A. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I RISE IN- SUPPORT MY HONORED TO SUPPORT S. C. R. TWENTY NINE AND ALSO IN HONOR MARIA SCHENKER. A POLISH JEW WHO DIED IN THE CAMP ON AUGUST NINETEENTH NINETEEN FORTY TWO. AS PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE RESOLUTION I FEEL THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT WE LEARNED THAT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THE FULL HISTORY OF THESE TRANSFORMATIVE EVENTS THE CHANGE THE COURSE OF THE WORLD AND OUR LIVES. THE GRAVITY IN THE IMPACT OF THE ATROCITIES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE WHOLE COSTS. ARE IMMENSE. SIX MILLION JEWS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE MILLION OTHER PEOPLE WHO THE GERMANS FELT WERE RACIALLY INFERIOR- MURDERED BY THE **** GERMAN DICTATORS AND IT WAS PART OF A STATE SANCTIONED EFFORT. OF CULTURAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ANNIHILATION. LET US REMEMBER AND EMPHASIZE THE ACTS OF HEROISM LOVE AND EMPATHY THAT ALSO OCCURRED AT THE TIME. THERE ARE COUNTLESS STORIES OF EVERYDAY HEROES WHO PUT THEIR OWN LIVES ON THE LINE TO PROTECT AND SAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN LINE TO BE MURDERED BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE RELIGION OR OTHER DIFFERENCES. THERE'S A VIRAL VIDEO OF A BRITISH GENTLEMAN NAME SIR NICHOLAS WINTON. BEEN SURPRISED AT AN AMPHITHEATER NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SURROUNDED BY STRANGERS WHO ENDED UP BEING SOME OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE CHILDREN HE HELP SAVE FIFTY YEARS EARLIER FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA ON THE EVE OF WORLD WAR TWO HE HELP SAVE THESE CHILDREN FROM THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. THROUGH A REFUGEE PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO HELP KIDS YOUNGER THAN SEVENTEEN RELOCATE IF THEY HAD A HOST FAMILY. HIS EFFORTS INVOLVED DANGERS BRIBES FORGERY SECRET CONTACTS NINE REAL ROAD TRAINS AN AVALANCHE OF PAPERWORK AND A LOT OF MONEY. THE VIDEO IS HEARTWARMING BECAUSE OF THE APPRECIATION SHOWN NOT ONLY BY SIR WIN BUT ALSO BY THE ADULTS IN THE ROOM WHO WERE PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE FULL LIVES BECAUSE OF HIS HEROISM. WE ALSO CAN'T FORGET HIS ABILITY TO SAVE THE CHILDREN ALSO INVOLVED HIM MEETING TERRIFIED PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE ENOUGH TO SAVE THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY SURRENDERED THEM TO STRANGERS IN A FOREIGN LAND THAT SOUND FAMILIAR. SAYS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE JEWISH COMMITTEE. WITH ALL THOSE WHO SUFFERED GREATLY BECAUSE OF THE HOLOCAUST AND ASK YOU ALL TO REMEMBER THE PAST SO WE DON'T REPEAT. ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS EXTEND OUR THANKS THE JEWISH CAUCUS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND IMPORTANT WORK ON THIS RESOLUTION. SENATOR MAN. THE MAN CARE I'D LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- THE CITY OBVIOUS THE HOLOCAUST IS ONE OF THE WORST TRAGEDIES THIS WAS EVER EXPERIENCE AN EXAMPLE. OF THE DEPTHS TO WHICH THE WHOLE HUMAN SOKEN SANK THE EVILS OF WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS CAPABLE OF. THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC BUREAUCRATIC STATE SPONSORED PERSECUTION AND MURDER OF SIX MILLION JEWS. NOW WE TALK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND SAY NEVER AGAIN BUT THAT HAS TO BE A ACTIVE. TERM WE HAVE TO BE ACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND HONOR THE HOLOCAUST AND THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE FRAGILITY OF OUR OWN CIVILIZATION OF OUR OWN SOCIETY CULTURE. AND INSTITUTION AGAINST ON TRACTATE. OVER SEVENTY YEARS AFTER THE HOLOCAUST WE ARE AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED IN DANGER OF FORGETTING THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST. WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW AN ALARMING RISE IN HATE OF ALL STRIPES INCLUDING AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS IN MY DISTRICT WE SAW THE HORRIFIC MURDER OF BLAZE BERNSTEIN. AND OPENLY GAY AND JEWISH YOUNG MAN IN ORANGE COUNTY BY MEMBER OF AN ANTI SEMITIC AND HOMOPHOBIC HATE GROUP. WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF ANTI API ACTS OF HATE AND JUST LAST WEEK IN MY DISTRICT WHO CLOCKS PLAN PROPAGANDA WAS DISTRIBUTED. IN NEWPORT BEACH AND HUNTINGTON BEACH IN MY DISTRICT THEY'RE PLANNING A WHITE LIVES MATTER RALLY IN HUNTINGTON BEACH IN THE COMING DAYS. THE RISE OF HATE IS ON THE MARCH AND AS ELECTED OFFICIALS WE HAVE TO STAY VIGILANT AND CALL THIS OUT WHEN WE SEE IT. SO THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WE NEED TO STAND UNITED WITH OUR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITY AND AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY CONTINUE TO CONDEMN HATE. DISCRIMINATION AND BIGOTRY IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE WAY. I THINK MY COLLEAGUE IN SOME SENSES SCHOOL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ITEM. SENATOR ALAN. ISN'T- PLANNING ON SPEAKING TODAY BUT- BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THIS CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT. ROSS COMMUNITY SOLIDARITY AND THE TWEET THAT- THAT. I'VE BEEN GIVEN FOR MY BIRTHDAY MARCH THIRTEENTH AND I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE NOTICING YOUR BOOKLETS AND MOST OF THE VICTIMS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED. WE'RE IN THE JEWISH BUT THE ONE THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED FOR ME. WAS A POLISH SILESIAN CATHOLIC PRIEST JOSEPH KOWALSKI. WHO IS WHO WAS KILLED- IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR. THIS IS A- AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE GRAPHIC NATURE OF THIS TWEET BUT I'M WITH PERMISSION FROM THE FROM THE CHAIR I'LL READ IT. HE WAS KILLED ON JULY FOURTH. NINETEEN FORTY TWO DROWNED IN A BARREL OF FECAL MATTER IN THE PENAL COMPANY. IN NOW STATES WHERE HE WAS LACED FOR REFUSING. TO TRAMPLE A ROSARY. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MEMBERS THIS WAS A MAN WHO WAS KILLED PRESUMABLY BY BY SOMEONE WHO IT WAS LIKELY RAISED IN THE CHRISTIAN FAITH. I AND YET WHO WHO HAD BECOME SO DEHUMANIZED. BY HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE HOLOCAUST HE WAS WILLING TO WITNESS A MANIFEST A CATHOLIC PRIEST DROWNED IN THIS AWFUL MANNER FOR REFUSING TO VIOLATE HIS OWN FATE BY TRAMPLING ROSARY. REMIND ME SO MUCH OF MY EXPERIENCE I SPENT SOME TIME WORKING AT THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR RWANDA IN AFRICA AND I AND I'LL NEVER FORGET A LINE I READ DURING THAT EXPERIENCE- WHO IS A IS AN INCREDIBLE BOOK CALLED MACHETE SEASON WHICH TALKS ABOUT. THE FOLKS WHO WENT OUT EVERY DAY TO KILL PEOPLE DURING THE GENOCIDE IN RWANDA. AND ONE OF THE QUOTES ON NEVER FORGET WAS FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS A KILLER. WHO BENEFIT ARMOR AND HE SAID- IT WAS A LOT MORE FUN THAN FARMING AND THAT HE REALIZED HE WAS A LOT EASIER TO KILL A HUMAN BEING IN THE TELECAST- AND HE JUST WOULD GO OUT DAY AFTER DAY WITH A MACHETE. AND STRAIGHT DOWN. TOOTSIES AS PART OF THAT GENOCIDE AND FOR ME IT JUST REMINDS IT'S JUST A REMINDER OF THE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF TRAGEDY. THEY PLAY HERE THE DEHUMANISATION IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY INCLUDING THE FOLKS. WHO PARTICIPATE IN THESE IN THESE TERRIBLE ATROCITIES AND I THINK IT'S A REMINDER ALSO OF WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US. TO NOT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS IS A TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED TO THE JEWISH PEOPLE INDEED HAPPEN TO SO MANY PEOPLE AND IT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THE PERILS. OF WHEN WE WHEN WE MARGINALIZE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT REMINDS ME OF COURSE OF THIS FAMOUS POEM FROM THE GERMAN LUTHERAN PASTOR MARTIN NIEM MAULER. THAT'S ABOUT THE COWARDICE OF GERMAN INTELLECTUALS IN CERTAIN CLERGY INCLUDING BY HIS OWN ADMISSION THE MILLER HIMSELF FOLLOWING THE **** RISE TO POWER. IN SUBSEQUENT INCREMENTAL PRGING OF THEIR CHOSEN TARGETS GROUP AFTER GROUP AFTER GROUP AND SOME WITH PERMISSION TO READ. I WILL READ HIS FAMOUS POEM. FIRST CAME FOR THE SOCIALISTS AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I WAS NOT A SOCIALIST. THEN THEY CAME FOR THE TRADE UNIONISTS. AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I WAS NOT A TRADE UNIONIST AND OF COURSE WE CAN. REPLACE THESE GROUPS WITH WITH SO MANY- ON ON THE MARGINS THEN THEY CAME FOR THE JEWS AND I DID NOT SPEAK OUT BECAUSE I WAS NOT A JEW. AND THEN THEY AME FOR ME. AND THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO SPEAK FOR ME. HIRED YOUR VOTE YOUR SUPPORT FOR US YOUR TWENTY NINE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. TWENTY NINE AS RELATES TO CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. TODAY LET US REMEMBER ALL THOSE THAT WE LOST THE SOLDIERS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES TO LIBERATE TO CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND SURVIVORS WHO MIRACULOUSLY INVADED DEATH AND HOPELESSNESS THAT SURROUNDED THEM. MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS OF PASS SINCE THE HORRIFIC AND INHUMANE EVENTS. OF THE HOLOCAUST IN WHICH SIX MILLION JEWS FACED SYSTEMATIC PERSECUTION AND DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THE **** REGIME AND THE CO CONSPIRATORS. THOUGH THE ORGANIZE A STATE SANCTIONED ELIMINATION OF BLOCKS. MANY BLOCKS FACE THE PERSECUTION THE ALIENATION AND THE MURDER OF THE **** PARTY IN GERMANY BUT GERMANS EXPERIENCED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ISOLATION BY WAY OF DISCRIMINATORY POLICIES LIKE THE NUREMBERG RACE LAWS OF NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. WHICH FORCED UPON- STERILIZATION OF BIRATIONAL CHILDREN. BLOCKS WERE NOT ONLY THE SOLELY FASCINATION OF ADOLF HITLER- DURING THAT BUT IT WAS THE- SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIRST. TAKE A TARGET ALL AFRICAN AMERICAN UNIT THEY WERE THE FIRST FACES. THAT THE SURVIVORS OF THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS SAW IT WAS THOSE MEN WHO LIBERATED OUR SHORTS AND THE FATHER CONCENTRATION CAMPS DURING WORLD WAR TWO YES THEY WENT HOME HE FACED UNSPEAKABLE PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY SHOULD REMIND US ALL OF THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF WHITE SUPREMACY. AND IDEOLOGY AND THE POLICE IT HAS GLOBALLY AND THE FAX OF TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD WE- AS WE CONTINUE TO WITNESS DRAMATIC RISE IN HATE CRIMES AGAINST ALL HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED GROUPS. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST. THESE INJUSTICES. IN THE STATE THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE FASCINATION AND CULT LIKE FOLLOWING OF THE ORANGE MAN IS JUST SAW IT ALL PHILLIP START. AND IT CULMINATED IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE SAW AT OUR NATION'S CAPITAL ON JANUARY SIX THIS IS JUST OF THE HOLOCAUST MOVEMENT STARTED. SO AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE WEBSITE JUST STATED- WE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THE PAST MEMBERS LET'S NOT ONLY VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION TODAY WELL WE NEED TO REALLY REMAIN VIGILANT AND PERSISTENT AND FIGHT AGAINST WHITE SUPREMACY BECAUSE IT'S REAL IN THIS COUNTRY IT'S JUST LIKE A WAS IN **** GERMANY. SEVENTY YEARS AGO IT'S REAL AND UNITED STATES IT'S IN THE DNA OF THIS COUNTRY AND WE SHOULD SPEAK OUT AGAINST IT OUR STRONGEST IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE ASK FOR A VOTE. SENATOR AKOWSKI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AYE. AYE CHU WAS NOT PLANNING TO SPEAK IN BUT- AS A- PROUD. POLISH CATHOLIC AMERICAN. AND SOMEBODY WHO'S LIVED IN POLAND FOR TWO YEARS I THOUGHT I'D- SHARE THE BENEFIT OF MY THOUGHTS HAVING. BEEN TO OCEAN ST WHICH IS A SMALL TOWN THAT HOUSE WHICH WAS RENAMED. THE GERMANS DID. CHOSE OCEANS IN WHICH IS A SMALL LITTLE- PLACE OUTSIDE OF A- I KATOWICE BECAUSE IT'S WE'RE- THE NORTH SOUTH. IN THE EAST WEST RAIL ROAD CAME IN. AND THAT. SMALL VILLAGE HAS WILL BE CHANGED FOREVER BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER. HEAR THE POLISH NAME AND KNOW. THE TERROR THAT IT MAN. AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OF YOU KNOW. IT'S COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD OF THE SIX MILLION JEWS THAT WERE KILLED. THREE MILLION OF THOSE WERE POLISH JEWS AND THREE MILLION MORE JEWS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY THERE WERE THREE MILLION. POLISH CATHOLIC OR POLISH ATS THAT WERE KILLED. DURING THAT THAT TERROR WHEN I STUDIED IT YEAH THE ONLY UNIVERSITY. WHICH IS NAMED AFTER KING YEAH GAIL. WHO IN FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AFTER. FERDINAND ISABEL KICKED ALL THE JEWS OUT OF SPAIN INVITED THEM TO SET UP THE CITY. IN POLAND IT WASN'T THEIR FIRST CHOICE AND I'M INTERESTED IN A LOT OF PEOPLE FIRST CHOICE WOULD BE. TO GO TO CRACK ALIBIED. DEFENDER SAID THEY HAD. A PLACE TO LIVE AND THEY WERE THE- IN THE STATE THERE THEY WERE. OF THE EARLY WERE THE TANKS FIRST CAME IN AND THE POLISH ARMY WAS FIGHTING AGAINST. THEM ON THEIR HORSE BACKS AND THE RECEIVERS THE FIRST THING THAT THEY DID ON THE IN THE TERROR WITH THE WOMEN AND KILLED ALL THE MILITARY ALL THE LEADERS OF THE MILITARY. AND THEN THEY WENT INTO YAK ALONG KING INVERSELY AND ILLED ALL THE PROFESSORS FOR THE INTELLIGENCIA AND THE POWER SYSTEM THAT WAS THERE THERE WAS ELIMINATED. AND I'M REFLECTIVE TODAY OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN HUNGARY AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN POLAND. WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT YOU HAVE THE JUDICIARY IN THE EVEN NATION BEING TORN APART. RIGHT NOW IN PUTTING IN. REPRESSIVE FOLKS BETTER. IN THE SAME TYPE OF HORRIBLE RHETORIC THAT WE HEARD FOR VOICE HEARD SEVENTY YEARS AGO SO IT'S WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT I SPEAK TO THE CHAMBER TODAY BUT WITH WITH GREAT HOPE THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THE LESSONS THAT WE DID THAT WE CELEBRATE. WHETHER IT'S THE. THE BLACK CAUCUS FOR THE ASIAN PACIFIC CAUCUS TO THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS OUR DIFFERENCES BUT WE UNITE TOGETHER AS CALIFORNIANS HIS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BODY TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE BIT THEIR LIPS A LITTLE BIT BETTER FOR THE NEXT GENERATION THAT'S COMING. AND ORIGINAL BOX. SENATOR STERN. PRESIDENT OF THE THREE THE SOLIDARITY. I'VE ALWAYS FROM CHAMBERS I THINK SAYS MORE THAN I DO ABOUT. HE NICK SINGULARITY OF THIS EVENT THEY WERE COMMEMORATING TODAY I THINK THE SINGULARITY OF OTHER ATROCITIES AND HOW EACH ONE OF THEM IS SORT OF UNIMAGINABLE ON THEIR OWN- NEED EIGHT ALMOST WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD SIX MILLION AND IT STOPS TO FEEL REAL- MUCH LIKE. SOMETHING LIKE INSULATING MILLIONS OF AFRICANS AND BRINGING THEM OVER TO THIS COUNTRY SEEMS KIND OF BEYOND COMPREHENSION OR THE GENOCIDE OF. MILLIONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS DOESN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE IT'S REAL BUT ALL THOSE THINGS HAPPENED. I'M BUT JUST LIKE THAT THOSE EVENTS IN TRAGEDIES ARE UNIQUELY SINGULAR SO WE'RE THE TRIUMPHS. AND THOSE TRIBES ARE LONELIER SOMETIMES. AND I WANTED TO JUST SHARE ONE BRIEF TRIUMPH THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING PRIVY TO MY OWN LIFE- MY FATHER IN LAW AND MOTHER IN LAW SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. JOSHUA KAUFMAN- AT THE LAST TIME WE HAD A HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL EVENT HERE IN THE CAPITAL. STOOD ON THE FLOOR WITH HIM- AND WITH HIS DAUGHTER. IS NOW MY WIFE. AND LEARNING FROM JOSHUA MARGARET KAUFMAN TO IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES CAME OVER. AFTER THEIR FAMILIES WERE KILLED AND THEY DID NOTHING LAST. AND TRYING TO REBUILD SOME LIFE IN AMERICA. MOVING TO LOS ANGELES AND IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AFTER SPENDING SOME YEARS IN ISRAEL AND IN DP CAMPS AND TRYING TO GO BACK TO HUNGRY AND BEING PUSHED OUT BY THE SAME ANTI SEMITES TO TURN THEM OVER THE **** BUT WATCHING THEM JUST MAKE A LIFE. IN LOS ANGELES WORKING CLASS PLUMBER- STILL HAS HIS PLUMBING TRUCK. JOSH WAS PLANNING- FOR BUYING PROBABLY AROUND THE WEST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES IF YOU EVER SEE IT WAVES- THE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT FORTY CON ONLINE VET. AND HE DROVE THAT PROUDLY WITH AMERICAN AND ISRAELI FLAGS ON TOP AND- SHOWED HIS PRIDE IN BEING AN AMERICAN AND TO THE SENATOR FROM GUARDINO IS POINT. ABOUT THE VETERANS WHO LIBERATED HIM HE HE DID LOSE FAITH IN GOD. HE GREW UP- AN ORTHODOX JEW IN DEBRECEN HUNGARY IN AND HIS RABBI AND SAID TO THE FAMILY JUST PRAY. AND STAY THE RABBI LEFT AND THEY DID STAY AND PRAYED AND IT DIDN'T WORK. THEY LEFT IN BEHIND BUT THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T DIDN'T SHOW UP AND ACTUALLY LIBERATE THEM AND THE PEOPLE HE SOUGHT OUT TO ANSWER PRECISELY. THE AMERICAN VETERANS WHO CENTER FROM GUARDINO SPOKE OF. AND HE HAS A DANGEROUS NOW TRADITION OF KISSING THE SHOES OF ANY VETERAN HE MEETS SO BE CAREFUL- TO THE SENATOR FROM- A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH- IN PICO RIVERA IF HE MEETS YOU YOU MAY KISS YOUR SHOES I KNOW THERE WILL SIGNED- BUT I JUST. WANT TO TELL THAT STORY BRIEFLY BECAUSE HE'S STILL HERE- HE'S IN A HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW TRYING TO RECOVER AND GET HIS FEET BACK UP HONORING AGAIN BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AMONG US WHO HAVE SEEN THIS I HAVE BEEN HERE TO THIS TRAGEDY. AND THEY'RE STILL LIVING. AND THEY'RE PROUD TO BE AMERICANS AND- THEY GRANTED OUT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE SO LET'S USE THESE MOMENTS AND NOT JUST SAY NEVER AGAIN- BUT TO THE SENATOR OF IRVINE'S POINT AS WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO THE ACTION HERE. AND SO I'M TRYING TO SEND JOSH WOULD DOWNTURN THAT KKK RALLY- BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAS A SIGN HE LIKES TO BRING OUT ALL THE HATEFUL RALLIES THAT HE SHOWED UP AT OVER THE YEARS. THAT SAYS- HE CALLS IT HATE MISS. PLEASE YOU MUST FIGHT. HATE S. pKAUFMAN I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TOO WAS NOT PLANNING TO SPEAK BUT WAS TOUCHED BY SO MANY OF THE- COMMENTS AN OBSERVATION SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUES. YOM HA SHOAH IS A DAY OF REMEMBRANCE WHERE WE CAN HONOR THE MEMORY OF THE MILLIONS MURDERED IN THE **** HOLOCAUST. AND IT ALLOWS US TO RE EXAMINE. OUR CONNECTED HERITAGE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IN A KNOWLEDGE OUR COLLECTIVE HISTORY. AND TO RECOMMIT TO FIGHTING AGAINST HATE. BIGOTRY AND INTOLERANCE. AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM GARDENA HITLER WAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN HIS SAVAGE DISPLAY OF INHUMANITY HEALING TO. JEWISH AND BLACK PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WHILE NOT TARGETED IN THE SAME PERNICIOUS WAYS. MANY AS WAS MENTIONED WERE STERILIZED INCARCERATED AND MURDERED SHOWING HIS TRUE DISDAIN FOR WHAT HE CALLED RACIAL ALIENS. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ANTI SEMITISM IS STILL REAL. AND IN X. INSIDIOUS EXAMPLE OF HATE AND INTOLERANCE HATE CRIMES ARE ON THE RISE IN OUR JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED. EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE HOLOCAUST CAN HAPPEN AGAIN MAYBE WITH A DIFFERENT WORD A DIFFERENT TITLE. AND INSTEAD OF TRAINS AND CAMPS AND SHOWERS. TODAY'S TOOLS WOULD BE TECHNOLOGY AND CLICKS. AND DATA MISINFORMATION. BUT THE ONE ELEMENT THAT WOULD REMAIN CONSTANT. IS FEAR. FEAR OF ANOTHER FEAR OF ONE ANOTHER. FEAR OF SOMEONE ELSE. I ASK THAT WE CONTINUE TO. ACTIVATE THE WORD SOLIDARITY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TRULY MEANS TO LINK ARMS. WITH OUR BROTHERS AND OUR SISTERS TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS PERNICIOUS WEED CALLED HATE AND ON BEHALF OF THE SO MANY JEWISH AMERICANS WITH WHOM I REPRESENT IN SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AS C. R. TWENTY NINE. SENATOR BURGESS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I THINK A LOT HAS BEEN SAID TODAY. SOME VERY TOUCHING STORIES. IN A FEW WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO BE- COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE APRIL TWENTY FOUR THE REASON I BRING THAT UP. IS BECAUSE NGUYEN ATROCITIES WENT UNANSWERED. IT FACILITATED INSPIRED. OTHERS TO RE COMMIT ATROCITIES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT WERE EXPERIENCE DURING WORLD WAR TWO IN THE HOLOCAUST. THERE WAS A FAMOUS QUOTE BY ADOLF HITLER- AFTER THE OTTOMAN TURKS HAD- KILLED THE ARMENIANS AND THE GREEKS IN THE ASSYRIANS TO THE TUNE OF OVER A COUPLE OF MILLION PEOPLE. WHO AFTER ALL REMEMBERS THE ARMENIANS. THAT I THINK IS VERY TELLING. THAT A STATEMENT BY A MONSTER LIKE THE FORMER LEADER OF GERMANY OF THE RIGHT. WOULD USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE IN JUSTIFICATION THAT HE COULD COMMIT SUCH ATROCITIES AND NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEM. I THINK WHAT'S INSPIRING NOT ONLY IS WE HONOR THOSE THAT PERISHED DURING THE HOLOCAUST. IS THAT WE ALSO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE- REMIND OURSELVES HOW EASILY THESE THINGS CAN HAPPEN AGAIN. AND HOW THEY HAVE IN THE LAST SEVENTY YEARS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN XINJIANG. CHINA IN THE NORTHWESTERN PORTION AND THE CCP'S POLICIES TOWARD THE WEEK OR- AND THE DETENTION OF MILLIONS OVER THERE IN THE FOR STERILIZATIONS ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE. THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING WHETHER MY COLLEAGUE GO FROM DOWN SOUTH INDICATED HELLO RWANDA OCCURRED AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO I THINK AS WE- TAKE A VOTE ON S. YOUR TWENTY NINE. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY TO HONOR THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN DURING THE HOLOCAUST. BUT TO REMIND OURSELVES REGULARLY. THAT WE MUST STEP UP. ENGAGE BE VOCAL AND TAKE ACTION WHETHER IT'S ON THE ISSUES OF XINJIANG OR EASTERN EUROPE OR WHAT'S HAPPENING STILL OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. WE HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION AS AMERICANS AS HUMANS. WE SEE THESE THINGS WE CANNOT BE SILENT BECAUSE OUR COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER IF WE DON'T AND WE'RE THE LAST VOICE STANDING. THERE WILL BE NO ONE STANDING UP FOR US. SENATOR JONES. PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE BRIEFLY THIS MORNING- A DAY THAT- CHANGED MY LIFE A LITTLE BIT- MY WIFE'S- I'M SORRY MY MOTHER'S GRANDPARENTS IMMIGRATED FROM GERMANY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS. SO I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS SENSITIVE AND KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE HOLOCAUST. ALWAYS TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE LESSONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY THAT. BUT DOES BETTER THAT TEN YEARS AGO MY WIFE AND I WERE VISITING THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY FAIR OR THAT THE DEL MAR FAIR. ON A HOT SUMMER DAY WITH OUR THREE KIDS. AND WORK KIND OF JUST DOING WHAT YOU DO IT AT THE COUNTY FAIR WALKING THROUGH THE RIDES AND- THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE BEING SOLD IN THE EXHIBITION HALLS. BUT WE CAME ACROSS A CORNER OF THE OF THE FAIR THAT- IS KIND OF OFF TO THE SIDE AND- NOT VERY WELL DISPLAYED. BUT IT WAS A TRAVELING HOLOCAUST MUSEUM- DISPLAY. AND I THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT I THINK I KNOW. THAT HISTORY. HI SO I TOOK MY WIFE AND MY KIDS THROUGH THAT HISTORY THROUGH THAT SMALL EXHIBIT WASN'T VERY BIG MAYBE TEN PANELS- TEN FOOT BY TEN FOOT IN DISPLAYING PHOTOS AND ARTIFACTS AND- DIFFERENT THINGS FROM THE HOLOCAUST. MY LIFE CHANGED THAT DAY. WALKING THROUGH THAT DISPLAY- TO SEE IN PHOTOGRAPHS AND IN ARTIFACTS. AND TO GAINES SOME SMALL ASIAN YOU CAN'T REALLY EVER GAIN AN APPRECIATION FOR THAT KIND OF THING ABOUT LIVING THROUGH IT I SUPPOSE- THE SYNAGOGUE OF THAT OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MISSION IS AND HOW WE CALIFORNIAN MY DISTRICT. AND THE RESILIENCY OF THAT CONGREGATION HAS AMAZING. AS HAS WE'VE ALL SHARED THE RESILIENCY OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE IN AMERICA AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. I WAS AMAZED US WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY I LOOKED UP THE LOS ANGELES. ALL COST MUSEUM AND ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY HAVE A VIRTUAL TOUR THANK YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR. I'M GONNASIGN UP FOR ONE AND I'M GONNA TAKE A VIRTUAL TOUR. OF THE LOS ANGELES HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE IS ON MY LIST OF PLACES TO VISIT. BUT UNTIL WE CAN VISIT IN PERSON I'M GOING TO DO THE VIRTUAL TOUR. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF US. AT TO DO THAT OURSELVES AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO DO SO ALSO. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND S. C. R. TWENTY NINE THANK YOU. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SAYING NINE SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR THE- REALLY BEAUTIFUL- COMMENTS ON THIS IN THE HOLOCAUST IS SOMETHING THAT AS CARD- THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN A IN A PERMANENT WAY WHEN I THINK BACK TO THE FRONT OF MY- FAMILY ON BOTH SIDES FLOOD USED IN EUROPE AND RUSSIA- IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY TO ESCAPE VIOLENCE- AND HAD THEY NOT BEEN ABLE TO FULLY- AND HAD. AMERICAN IMMIGRATION POLICY NOT ALLOW THEM TO ENTER THEY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN EXTERMINATED- IN THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY TRUE OF FIVE MOST OF HER A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS. OF THE JURY OF THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS- AND SO IT'S A SORT OF MAKES IT REAL IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS DID NOT ON A LOOKING AT THE- OF THE TWEET OF FOR MY BIRTHDAY MAY ELEVENTH- WHO IS A FRENCH JEWISH BOY NAMES ON ALONG ON YOUR CARD TO DO. WHO WAS BORN. IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE IN ALGERIA. AND IN NINETEEN FOUR. SO HE WAS- EIGHT YEARS OLD- HE WAS TRANSPORTED. TO CONCENTRATION CAMP TALLIS VOTES. AND HE WAS- EXTERMINATED IN A GAS CHAMBER AT THE AGE OF EIGHT YEARS OLD. WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE OTHER PEOPLE- THE HORROR OF THE HOLOCAUST IT'S- AND CENTER AS A SENATOR. FROM LOS ANGELES STATED IT'S ALMOST TWO. LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND- AND THAT'S WHY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY IT'S FADED AND IT GETS DISMISSED PURPOSES TO PAY THAT COULD NEVER POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED- AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE TH PEOPLE NEVER FORGET.

RETURNING TO MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS MEMBER WE'RE GOING TO MEMBERS ARE GOING TO TAKE UP THE ADJOURN AND MEMORIES SENATOR ATKINS. WHEN PRESIDENT THANK YOU AND I WOULD ASK- FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COLLEAGUES- ESPECIALLY TODAY GIVEN THAT THE ADJOURNMENT IN MEMORY IS OF FORMER SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE A JIM MILLS. AND I'M GOING TO BREAK A LITTLE BIT FROM PRACTICE BECAUSE I'M SURROUNDED BY THIS GLASS AND I'M THE LAST PERSON AT THIS MIKE AND I'M GONNA TAKE MY MASK OFF. I RISE TODAY TO HONOR THE LIFE OF SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE REGION MILLS WHO PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK AT THE AGE OF NINETY THREE. AND I'M PARTICULARLY HONORED THAT ARE I'M GOING TO BE JOINED IN DISCUSSION OF THIS ADJOURNMENT BY THE DEAN OF OUR SENATE. I THE GOOD SENATOR FROM TO HEMA AND FROM OUR MAJORITY LEADER. NOW BOTH OF THEM OF COURSE I HAVE ACTUAL. STORIES AND LIFE EXPERIENCES WITH SENATOR MILLS. I HOWEVER I DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING HIM AS AS WELL AS IS THEY DID- ALTHOUGH FROM SAN DIEGO AND MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT JIM MILLS WAS THE SECOND- PRO TEMPORE A FROM SAN DIEGO I AM THE THIRD. BUT I CAME UP UNDER MY MENTOR AND PREDECESSOR SENATOR KIKO- AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE FROM MY DEAR FRIEND. A LOBBYIST CONSULTANT BEEN CLAY I GOT TO HEAR GREAT STORIES ABOUT JIM MILLS I WAS IN AWE OF HIM AND WHILE WE WERE IN TOWN AT THE SAME TIME. I GOTTA BE HONEST I WAS A LITTLE BIT INTIMIDATED TO APPROACH THIS ICONIC MAN WHILE HE WAS A QUIET IN NATURE AND STATURE. I CONSIDERED HIM A GIANT AND HE WAS HISTORIC IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE THINGS THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED WHICH I WILL. LEAD THE WAY IN MENTION IN A MOMENT- YOU KNOW THOSE OF US FROM SAN DIEGO IN SOME OTHER COUNTIES. NOT LA OR SAN FRANCISCO HISTORICALLY NO- THAT A LOT OF THE LEADERSHIP HAS COME FROM- THE GREAT CITIES OF LA AND SAN FRANCISCO SO WHEN. A SMALL TOWN WHICH IS HOW I LEARNED OF SAN DIEGO GROWING UP IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MY DAD CALLED IT A SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN WHEN HE SERVED HERE IN WORLD WAR TWO. SO WHEN I MADE MY WAY WEST SIDE TO SAN DIEGO A GREAT CITY- I THOUGHT OF US AS A SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN STILL EVEN AS I BECAME A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND HEADED TO SACRAMENTO- SO TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF A GIANT LIKE. SENATOR MILLS. IS A GREAT HONOR. AND I LOOK FORWARD- TO THE STORIES- THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUES AS I WRAP UP I WILL GIVE YOU. THE ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE COVERED IN AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND THEN ADJOURNMENT FOR A MAN. LIKE SENATOR MILLS. KIM WAS A NATIVE SAN DIEGANS EARNED HIS BACHELOR'S AND MASTER'S DEGREES IN HISTORY FROM SAN DIEGO STATE GO AS TAX. AND WENT ON TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY IN THE ARMY DURING THE KOREAN WAR. AFTER HIS SERVICE JIM RETURNED TO SAN DIEGO AND TAUGHT MIDDLE SCHOOL. AND RAN IT INTO PERO SERRA MUSEUM. IN NINETEEN SIXTY WITH ENCOURAGEMENT FROM HIS WIFE JOANNA. JIM WON AN ELECTION TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY WHERE HE SERVED FOR SIX YEARS BEFORE RUNNING AND WINNING A SEAT IN THE SENATE. WHERE HE SERVED UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. HE SPENT TWENTY TWO YEARS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE INCLUDING NEARLY A DECADE AS PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE A FROM. NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE TO NINETEEN EIGHTY. TIM'S LEGACY AS A LEGISLATOR WILL BEST BE REMEMBERED- BY MOST FOR HIS FORWARD THINKING WORK ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION. HE AUTHORED A BILL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO CREATE THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY SYSTEM THAT WOULD LATER BECOME A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND MUCH OF OUR STATE'S HISTORY HAS BEEN PRESERVED AS A RESULT OF THE MILLS ACT WHICH IS NAMED AFTER HIM THE LAW HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH SAVING THOUSANDS OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. FROM DESTRUCTION THE RIPRAP PRETTY TAX INCENTIVE FOR OWNERS WHO PRESERVE THEM. JAMES PIONEERING VISION ON THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY AND THE PRESERVATION OF BUILDINGS LIKE THOSE IN HISTORIC OLD TOWN SAN DIEGO. BELIEVE IN ETERNAL FOOTPRINT IN OUR COMMUNITY HE ALSO. A STATUS THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED OUR PORT IN SAN DIEGO. HOWEVER IT'S LESS PUBLICIZED- UNLESS PUBLICIZED ACTION THAT JIM TOOK THAT HAS LEFT A LASTING INSPIRATION AN IMPRESSION ON ME. OVER FORTY YEARS AGO IN THIS CHAMBER THERE WAS A DEBATE ON A BILL THAT WOULD DECRIMINALIZE HOMOSEXUALITY THE BILL WAS PLACED ON CALL. ONE VOTE SHORT IN A TWENTY TWENTY TIE. FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MERVYN DONNELLY WAS IN COLORADO AT THE TIME AS YOU KNOW IN INSTANCES OF A TIE VOTE OR MAYBE WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED THIS SO WE DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER IT ALL BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES IT IS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO SERVES AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE WHO CAST THE DECIDING VOTE. INSTEAD OF ADJOURNING THE SESSION SENATOR MILLS DECIDED TO KEEP THE BILL ON CALL UNTIL LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S VOTE COULD BE CAST HOURS LATER. AND HE KEPT HIS FELLOW SENATORS IN PLACE SO AS TO HOLD A QUORUM AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE TO BE HELD IN PLACE. WHEN PRO TEM JIM MILLS TEMPORARILY LOCKED THE SENATE DOORS HE HELPED COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS PERMANENTLY OPEN THEIR CLOSET DOORS. AND TAKE A GIANT STEP TOWARDS EQUALITY. AFTER HIS TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE JIM SERVED ON THE SAN DIEGO METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT BOARD WHICH I NAMED ITS HEADQUARTERS AFTER HIM I SPENT. A NUMBER OF YEARS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM C. N. T. SERVING ON THAT BOARD OF THAT BUILDING THAT BEARS HIS NAME. HE SPENT TIME ON AMTRAK'S BOARD AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. JIM IS SURVIVED BY HIS THREE CHILDREN BEATRICE ELEANOR AND BILL AND NINE GRANDCHILDREN IT WAS REALLY AN HONOR- IT TO SEE HIM RECOGNIZED AND I WANT TO THANK- THE INDIVIDUAL WAS TRYING SO HARD THIS MORNING TO REMEMBER THE PERSON THAT GAVE ME SO THAT I WOULD LEARN. A LITTLE MORE OF THE HISTORY A COPY OF JIM'S BOOK- A DISORDERLY HOUSE IT WAS INTERESTING READING AND- I WILL TURN IT OVER NOW WITH YOUR PERMISSION- PRESIDENT- TO MY COLLEAGUES TO ADD TO HIS COLORFUL HISTORY AND STORY AND THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR THE INDULGENCE. THIS IS PART OF OUR HISTORY OUR LEGACY AND- WE CANNOT LET THE MOMENT PASS WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING A GREAT MAN. THANK YOU. SENATOR NIELSEN. BETTER PRESENT READY GENTLE OF THE SENATE I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COME HERE DURING THE TENURE OF SENATOR JIM MILLS. AS A FRESHMAN SENATOR. YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO AND YOU NEED A LOT OF HELP AND MENTORING JIM WAS GREAT AT THAT. BUT THE THING THAT I WILL REMEMBER HIM MOST FOR HIS REVERENCE FOR HISTORY. AS YOU'VE COME TO THIS THE SENATE CHAMBER. HE COULD PASS IN YOUR MIND BECAUSE- WHEN THIS CHAMBER WAS DESIGNATED AS AS EARTHQUAKE VULNERABLE. MUCH DEBATE WENT ON IS WHAT DO WE DO. AND A COUNTER PROPOSAL TO RESTORING THIS BEAUTIFUL BUILDING WAS TEREPHTHALIC AND BUILD TWIN TOWERS. FORTUNATELY THAT DID NOT PREVAIL ENGINE BEING ASSISTED IS HISTORIAN INSISTED THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RESTORE THIS CHAMBER. THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE. THE PEOPLE WHO COULD DO THIS KIND OF WORK THE TECHNICAL WORK. THE CAREFUL WOULD WORK REQUIRED TO EMULATE THE CAPITAL. THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL. AND I HAVE A PICTURE OF THE REGIONAL CAPITAL OF PAINTING PICTURE IN MY OFFICE. JIM WAS INSISTENT ABOUT THAT. AND THAT BEING THE CASE THIS IS WHAT WE GET TO ENJOY. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. TODAY AND MORE FOR THE STERILE FACILITY THEY MIGHT BE VERY NICE MAYBE SOME MORE AMENITIES. BUT THIS IS HISTORY. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE ALL OF PAYMENT MORE ATTENTION TO. GEN BEING A HISTORIAN AND A MAGNIFICENT WRITER ABOUT HISTORY. DID CARE ABOUT WHAT WENT ON HERE BEFORE. WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS HIATUS PEOPLE SAID JIM WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW THAN BEFORE I SAID WELL. COLLEGIALITY IS DIMINISHED GOING FOR EACH OTHER. AND A REVERENCE FOR THE PAST OR EVEN A CURIOSITY ABOUT IT. HAS DIMINISHED. AND THAT'S NOT HELPFUL. SO AS WE ADDRESS BILLS. DURING THIS YEAR OF FOR ME AT LEAST IT IS VAN. MEMBERS COME UP WITH LEGISLATION AND THAT WAS THE BRIGHT LIGHT THAT WENT ON AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER TALKED ABOUT IT AND THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. WELL THERE'S VERY LITTLE NEW UNDER THE SUN HERE. JIM KNEW THAT. ANY GOOD COACH PEOPLE ABOUT WELL WHAT WENT ON BEFORE SO THEY MIGHT LEARN FROM THE PRIOR. LEGISLATION THAT HAD BEEN HERE. AND PARTICULARLY KNOWING AND THE REFERENCE TO THE RULES OF THE HOUSE OF THE INSTITUTION. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE MINORITY PARTY AROUND HERE. WE GOT AS CLOSE AS SIXTEEN ONE TIME. BUT I REALIZED THAT THE PROTESTS. THEY ALSO HAD. A SENSE OF THEIR OWN HISTORY. THAT THEY WERE THE PRO TEM. OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. AND THIS INSTITUTION IS ALWAYS HAD A TRADITION OF BEING LESS PARTNERS. IN ITS COMPARTMENT. THEN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. KIM WROTE SEVERAL BOOKS ONE ABOUT PONTIUS PILOT. I WANT TO BACK UP THE BOOK WAS OF PUNCHES PILOT. ANOTHER WAS CALLED THE DISORDERLY HOUSE. IT WAS KIND OF A POKE AT THE STATE ASSEMBLY. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. NOW I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING IN BOTH HOUSES OF BRIEFLY IN THE ASSEMBLY IN A LONG TIME HERE. AND THE TRADITIONS ARE DIFFERENT. AND THE COMPORTMENT IS DIFFERENT. ORDER THE SIMPLE REASONS IS THERE MORE MEMBERS OF THAT HOUSE THAN THIS ONE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO TRADITIONS. AND THERE ARE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT WORDS THAT DESCRIBE. SENATE PRO TEM JIM MILLS SENATORIAL COURTESY. HE WELCOME TO ME AS A CALL. AS DID SOME OF THE OTHER OLD TIMERS THAT EVEN PROCEEDED JIM LIKE RALPH DEALS. I APPRECIATED THAT AND IT'S HELPED ME OVER THESE YEARS BE A MUCH BETTER CENTER. THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. OTHERWISE HE WAS A VERY AMIABLE MAN TO NOT ABUSIVELY. MORE STATE. BUT YET HE HAD A QUIET SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT IN. AND MOST OF ALL HE HAD A REFERENCE FOR THIS INSTITUTION. OFTEN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE I HAVE WALKED DOWN THE HALLWAY HERE AND- LOOK AT THE FORMER PRO TENNIS. AND I'VE KNOWN PROGRAMS ALL THE WAY BACK TO BUTCH POWERS WHO'S IN A TENT GOVERNOR UNDER A WARRANT. IT IS ALWAYS STRUCK ME AS I LOOK AT THOSE FORMER MEMBERS AND KNOW WHAT I KNOW OF THEM HISTORICALLY IN SOME CASES IT WAS EVEN PERSONALLY. AND THEN WATCH THE SUCCESSIVE PRO TEMS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. ALL OF THOSE FOR TENS OF CARRIED ON THOSE TRADITIONS. THE GYM HILLS SO MARVELOUSLY UP HELPED. AND WHEN WE COME HERE. WE NEED TO BE REMEMBER REMEMBER THAT I THINK. A FUNNY STORY. RALPH DEALS AND I HAD AN INTERESTING HISTORY AND WE CALL EACH OTHER BROTHER DEALS AND BROTHER NIELSEN THAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING A CENTER BROTHER WAS A THE BROTHERHOOD'S OF THE VARIOUS. ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS IMPORTANT IN THE EAR OF BROWNFIELDS NOT SO MUCH MY OWN BUT THE ELKS CLUB THAT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD. ORDER A LOT OF FELLOWS OR WHATEVER. AND A PERSON FROM THE ASSEMBLY CAME AND JOINED THE SENATE. AND WE'RE DOING THIS MARVELOUS FEATURES REALLY STARTED UP AND RAISING HIS VOICE AND WAVING HIS HANDS AND. BY SEN ROGER LETTERS DESK. IN ELECT YEP IT'S RALPH GILLES TALL MAN POWERING OVER ME. THEY LOOK DOWN AT ME THEY SAID ARE YOU LISTENING TO THE GOOD CENTER- I SHOULD I'M LISTENING INTENTLY BROTHER DEALS. WELL BROTHER NIELSEN. DON'T YOU THINK WHEN HE FINISHES WE SHOULD GO HAVE A TALK WITH HIM. WELL THOSE ARE CODE WORDS. CODE BEING WELL WE BETTER JUST GUY SOMETHING. CODE WORD WAS YOU GO FIRST AND ALL BACKING UP. SO WHEN. THE GOOD SENATOR SET DOWN I MOSTLY GO OVER AND SAID WELL TO CENTER TO HAVE A MARVELOUS SPEECH. I SAID A FEW MORE THINGS I SAID OF THE MARVELOUS SPEECH TO BE DELIVERED. IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. AND THEN BROTHER DEALS CAME YOU'RE A SENATOR AND HE WAS A GREAT LESSON AND SENATORIAL COURTESY. THAT SENATOR NEVER HAD THAT A PROBLEM AGAIN ALL THE SUCCESSIVE PRO TENS. THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THE PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH HAVE COMPORTED THEMSELVES AND STEWARDED THIS INSTITUTION. IN THE MANNER THAT JIM MILLS DID. MY SUMMATION IS THIS WAS A MAN. OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. AND HE WAS A MAN. OF THE SENATE. A GOOD MAN. L. SURELY MISSION THEY WILL JOURNAL MEMORY. A GREAT LEADER CENTER JEN MILLS FOR TEN OF THE STATE SENATE. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IS- GREAT HONOR TO JOIN WITH OUR PRO TEM AND DEAN OF THE SENATE. IN ADJOURNING IN THE MEMORY OF A FORMER PRO TEM JIM MILLS. MY FIRST JOB IN THE GOVERNMENT WAS WITH THIS BODY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND MY FIRST PAYCHECK AT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH WAS SIGNED BY JAMES R. MILLS CHAIRMAN OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. IT WAS BIG MONEY BACK THEN. AND- EARLY ON AND GET TO KNOW HIM PERSONALLY VERY WELL I JUST AS THE PRO TEM SUGGESTED HER COPPER COMMENTS WAS ALWAYS NERVOUS IN HIS PRESENCE ALWAYS GRACIOUS TO ME AS A YOUNG KID- NOT ONE OF THESE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO I TRIED TO- EXHORTED STORY BUT ALWAYS LISTENED TO. YOU KNOW JUST EXTRAORDINARILY KIND AND GRACIOUS PERSON- I WAS THERE IS AN EMPLOYEE OF MERV DONNELLY. WORKING WITH HIM IN THIS THE CALL CAME IN MERVIN WAS IN CONTENT GOVERNOR SHOULDN'T SAY MARTIN. WAS IN THE COLORADO AND IT REALLY WAS AS THE PRO TEM SUGGESTED. THE PROTON MILLS WHO WAS THE LEADING FORCE BEHIND THIS AND- GOT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO COME BACK AND- YOU KNOW I GONNA SAW SPACES I COULD FROM A YOUNG ON TRAIN DIE- THE POWER INFLUENCE AND COMMITMENT. THAT HE EXPRESSED. I WASN'T IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED BUT IT WAS NEXT TO IT AND I'VE GOT TO OBSERVE IT TO SOME EXTENT. HE CAME HERE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX AFTER THE BAKER CARVE DECISION RESULTED IN THIRTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY MOVING TO THE SENATE. GEORGE OF MEIJIN WILSON ALL HOST OF FOLKS THAT TURNED OUT TO BE IMPORTANT LEADERS. IN THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA AND HE ROSE TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS. HE WAS A CO AUTHOR OF PROPOSITION ONE DAY WITH JUST. THAT BROUGHT US TO A FULL TIME LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX JOIN WITH JESS IN THAT REGARD TRANSFORMATIONAL ENDEAVOR. IN THE BOOK THAT FOLKS TALK ABOUT THE DISORDERLY HOUSE THAT I HAVE A COPY HERE- HAVE A COPY AT HOME BUT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT IN TIME OUR GREAT INCREDIBLE LIBRARIAN GREG LUCAS GAVE IT TO ME. AN IMPORTANT POINT IS OUR DEAN SAYS REVERENCE FOR HISTORY. WE ALL LIVE IN THIS CHAMBER WE ALL EXPERIENCE. THE KIND OF HUMAN INTERACTIONS THAT RESULT IN THE CREATION OF LEGISLATION OR TAX QUIETLY PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN THE HISTORIAN. WROTE THIS BOOK TO TALK ABOUT THE BROWN. THAT BROWN HENRI YEARS THAT WERE TRANSFORMATIONAL IN THE END WE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND SO MANY THINGS THAT WE DID IN CALIFORNIA TO CAPTURE THAT HISTORY. UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW UNLIKE THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION OR OTHERS THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY BOOKS TO WILLIE BROWN BOOK FEW OTHER BOOKS JOHN JACOBS WROTE THE CAPTURE THE HISTORY. BUT I THINK THAT THE POINT THAT THE DEAN MADE ABOUT REFERENCE IS INFORMED BY THE FACT THAT HE TOOK THE TIME TO CAPTURE THAT HISTORY AND I WOULD REALLY IT'S AN INTERESTING READ SB SIX THREE COMPLETE CANDID ABOUT A DIFFERENT TIME IN HISTORY BUT HE CAPTURES THAT MOMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT AND WE RECENTLY COMMUNICATED WITH HIM- AS THE PRO TEM- APPOINTED ME TO REPRESENT THIS BODY ON THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THIS COMMITTEE THAT'S OVERSEEING THE CAPITAL AND AS THE PRO TEM INDICATED HIS REVERENCE FOR HIS STATE HISTORIC BUILDINGS HE WAS IN THE DISCUSSION WANTED TO BE INVOLVED WITH RESPECTTO. THE NEW CAPITAL AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE STILL IN THE GAME THE TIME NINETY TWO YEARS OLD AGAIN NINETY THREE WHEN HE PASSED AWAY STILL IN THE GAME. STILL HAVING THAT. HI PUBLIC SERVICE DNA ABOUT STATE HISTORIC BUILDINGS ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE FUTURE IRRESPECTIVE OF HIS AGE INFORMED BY HIS DEEP COMMITMENT I ASK THAT WE JOURNEY THIS MEMORY THANK YOU. PLEASE MADAM PRO TEM. PLEASE BRING HIS NAME FORWARD TO THE DEATH SO THAT THE SENATE CAN APPROPRIATELY MEMORIALIZED HIM. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TO TURN IN MEMORY OF LESLIE SONG WINNER- I HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND IRVINE OVER LUNCH WELL I DON'T KNOW HER AS WELL AS MANY. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I COULD IMMEDIATELY SEE WHAT A REMARKABLE KIND AND PASSIONATE PERSON SHE WAS. WE STAYED INSIDE TOUCH SINCE THEN AND I WAS SO SADDENED TO LEARN ABOUT HER DEATH LAST WEEK. LESLIE PASSED AWAY ON APRIL FIRST OF THIS YEAR PEACEFULLY SURROUNDED BY LOVED ONES. LESLIE WAS THE ELDEST CHILD OF ALFRED SONG CALIFORNIA'S FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN STATE LEGISLATOR FIRST ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. AND THEN ELECTED TO THIS BODY THE STATE SENATE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. WESLEY WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT KEEPING HER FATHER'S MEMORY ALIVE. AS DIRECTOR OF THE SENATOR ALFORD AND SONG COMMEMORATION COMMITTEE. SHE LED THE INITIATIVE TO NAME THE WILSHIRE MATCH WESTERN METRO STATION AFTER HER FATHER. SO IT'S WORTH BRIEFLY MENTIONING HER FATHER'S CENTER ALFORD SONG IN HIS REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENTS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CENTER SONG WAS A CREAM AMERICAN BORN AND RAISED IN HAWAII. HE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES IN NINETEEN FORTY AND PERSEVERED AGAINST REPEATED DISCRIMINATION THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. WHETHER ISN'T TRYING TO ENLIST IN THE U. S. NAVY OR PURCHASING A HOME WITH RACIAL COVENANTS ON IT. AFTER THE SONG WENT ON TO BREAK SO MANY BAMBOO CEILINGS THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE A GRADUATE OF USC'S COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL. HE WAS THE FIRST KOREAN AMERICAN ADMITTED TO THE CALIFORNIASTATE BAR. THE FIRST ASIAN AMERICAN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND SOMEONE WHO IS SO FAR AHEAD OF HIS TIME IN FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF WORKING CALIFORNIANS. ANY PRESS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER. AMONG OTHER THINGS HE AUTHORED GROUNDBREAKING LEGISLATION PROTECTING VOTER RIGHTS. HE CREATED THE OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OVERALL THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. THE SONG BEVERLY CONSUMER WARRANTY ACT ALSO KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA LEMON LAW. UNTIL MY ELECTION LAST YEAR CENTER SONG WAS THE ONLY GREEN AMERICAN TO EVER HAVE SERVED IN THIS BODY THE STATE SENATE. AND HE LEAVES HUGE SHOES TO FILL. IS A TRULY EXCEPTIONAL LEGISLATOR WHO SERVED HONORABLY HERE FOR TWELVE YEARS. DESPITE HER MANY YEARS OF ADVOCACY TO RECOGNIZE THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HER FATHER LESLIE SONG WINNER. WAS NOT JUST THE DAUGHTER OF ALFRED SONG. SHE LIVED SUCH AN INCREDIBLE LIFE OF HER OWN. INSPIRED BY HER FATHER SHE LIVED AND BREATHED POLITICS WORKING IN THE GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFITS IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC SERVICE THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. ADVOCATING FOR THINGS LIKE MORE RECYCLING BETTER AIR QUALITY IN RACIAL EQUITY. LESLIE WAS FIERCE AND UNAPOLOGETIC IN PURSUING JUSTICE. SHE'S A PARTNER IN A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND LUCRATIVE POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM EARLIER IN HER CAREER BUT LEFT AT THE HEIGHT OF EARNING POWER STATING THIS IS NOT WHY I GOT INTO POLITICS. AND LIKE HER FATHER LESLIE WAS AHEAD OF HER TIME IN THE FIGHT SHE CHOSE TO PICK. AS A FIRE COMMISSION LOS ANGELES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETY SHE BECAME EMBROILED IN CONTROVERSY BECAUSE SHE INSISTED ON STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF MINORITY AND FMALE FIREFIGHTERS. AT A TIME WHEN THIS WAS ON POPULAR THING TO DO. AS ONE COLLEAGUE OF HERS AT THE TIME SAID. A SOMEWHAT INTERESTING SHE'S VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUES. AND WILL FIGHT FOR THEM SOMETIMES FOR OWN PERSONAL AND POLITICAL DETRIMENT. I THINK THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO HER CHARACTER. LESLIE WAS A PROUD KOREAN AMERICAN WHO IS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GREEN COMMUNITY. SHE HERSELF TAUGHT GREEN IMMIGRATION HISTORY AND DONATED A HUNDRED HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS FROM THE FIRST SCREEN AMERICAN SETTLERS TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. SHE IS THE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR OF THE KOREAN VOTERS RESOURCE CENTER. AND SHE STAYED ACTIVE IN RECENT YEARS AT A TIME WHEN MANY WOULD BE ENJOYING THEIR GOLDEN YEARS. AND TWENTY NINETEEN SING THE NEEDS OF THE ON HOUSE POPULATION IN HER COMMUNITY HE BEGAN DELIVERING HOME COOKED MEALS TWICE A WEEK TO MACARTHUR PARK IN LOS ANGELES. AS DEMAND FOR THESE MEALS PICKED UP AND GREW WITH THE RISE IN THE ON HOUSE POPULATION LESLIE ROSE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE. AS IT WAS A PASSION FIRST TO HELP THOSE IN NEED. SHE FOUNDED A NONPROFIT CALLED LUNCH IN THE PARK TO SCALE UP HER EFFORTS TO FEED AND HOUSE WITH HOME COOKED MEALS. AND EVEN TO THE END OF HER LIFE SHE WAS CONTINUING TO HELP OTHERS MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK IN PERSON. SHE IS SURVIVED BY HER HUSBAND AND THREE DAUGHTERS. AND I IT IS A VERY SAD DAY WE'VE LOST A TRULY GREAT AND GENEROUS LEADER. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND MADAM PRESIDENT.
