THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED GOOD MORNING MISS SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO PRESENT STR ONE TWENTY SEVEN DECLARING MAY AS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH. MENTAL ILLNESS IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DISABILITY IN THE UNITED STATES AFFECTING ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR FAMILIES. AMONG CALIFORNIA ADULTS ONE IN TWENTY SUFFERS FROM SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT MAJOR LIFE EXPECTED BODIES. THE RATE HIM AMONG CALIFORNIA CHILDREN IS EVEN HIGHER. ONE IN THIRTEEN SUFFERS FROM MENTAL ILLNESS THAT LIMITS HIS OR HER ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN DAILY. ACTIVITIES. NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL ILLNESS DO NOT RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT DO THE STIGMA. RESOURCES AN ADEQUATE DIAGNOSIS OR NO DIAGNOSIS. WITHOUT A DOUBT WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES SINCE THE PASSAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES ACT HOWEVER THE WORK IS NOT DONE. WE CAN AND MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE STIGMA THAT IS KEEPING TOO MANY PEOPLE FROM ACCEPT ASSESSING ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH. CARE THEY NEED. WE ALSO FIT ARE FACING A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF TRAINED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND INCREASING ACCESS TO THIS WORKFORCE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. EACH OF YOU HAS RECEIVED A VIBRANT GREEN TIRES SCARF AND A PIN AND ASK THAT YOU PLEASE WHERE THE SYMBOL IN SUPPORT OF MENTAL HEALTH. AWARENESS MONTH.

THERE PRESS REPORT AN INCREASE IN RACE RELATED SOCIO POLITICAL TRAUMA. BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE. TOO MANY OF OUR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IMMIGRANTS REFUGEES MINORITIES SUFFER DISPARITIES AND THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE DIAGNOSE AND ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE SERVE THE PEOPLE AND THERE IS NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR LIBERTY AND FOR THEIR HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH IS REAL. COMPLICATED. BUT IT IS IMPACTFUL. IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AND THIS GOVERNING BODY TO REFLECT THE TRUTH IN OUR ACTIONS. BY TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WE CAN HELP REDUCE THE STIGMA THAT PREVENT SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. FROM SEEKING THE SERVICES THEY DESERVE ANSEL RIGHTFULLY NEED. FROM VETERANS SUFFERING FROM PTSD. DEPRESSION TO THE UNDOCUMENTED FAMILY FACING FEAR OF FAMILY SEPARATION. TO THE TRAUMA EXPERIENCED BY YOUNG PEOPLE SIMPLY TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GET AN EDUCATION AND LIVE THROUGH A SCHOOL SHOOTING. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT WE CAN DO.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS YOU'RE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT ACR TWO THIRTY THREE. A RESOLUTION THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THE MUSLIM HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN AND EXPRESS THE LEGISLATURE'S RESPECT. TO MUSLIMS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. YESTERDAY WAS THE FIRST FULL DAY OF THE ISLAMIC HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN WHICH REQUIRES MUSLIMS TRIPS FAME FROM FOOD OR DRINK FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET. EVERY DAY FOR THIRTY DAYS. RAMADAN IS A TIME FOR REFLECTION AND SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE FOR MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN THEY EXPRESS OUR DEVOTION TO FAITH. FAMILY AND SERVICE TO THE LESS FORTUNATE. THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE A PILLAR OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE CITY. ENCOMPASSING NEARLY EVERY ETHNIC GROUP OF OUR STATE. THE RICH DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY HAS THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY PLACED MUSLIM AMERICANS AT THE FOREFRONT A SOME OF OUR MOST PRESSING SOCIAL ISSUES. CONSIDERING THAT HATE CRIMES AGAINST MUSLIM AMERICANS HAVE GONE UP EXPONENTIALLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. WITH THE RISE OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN ALONE. IT IS IMPERATIVE NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT WE AS A BODY TAKEN ACTIVE STAND. A CELEBRATE THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND CONTINUE TO AFFIRM AND DEFEND THEIR PLACE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES EMBODY OUR INHERENT VALUES AS A STATE. AND AS A COUNTRY. AS DOES OUR COMMIT COMMITMENT TO RESPECT. EQUALITY AND PEACE AMONG CULTURES. MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR TWO THIRTY THREE SO THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY WISH OUR MUSLIM FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. A BLAST RAMADAN I WOULD LIKE THE FIRST ROLE TO BE OPEN FOR COAUTHORS. THANK YOU. MEMBERS PLEASE GIVE YOUR ATTENTION TO A SOME MEMBER WEBER. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AND SUPPORTIVE ACR TWO THIRTY THREE AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY AS FOR BRINGING THIS RELEVANT AND HOLY RARE REMEMBRANCE TO THE CELEBRATION. ARE ON THIS FLOOR. I WANT EXTEND MY BEST WISHES TO MUSLIMS IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD HAPPY RAMADAN. RAMADAN IS THE MONTH IN WHICH MUSLIMS BELIEVE THE KORAN WAS REVEALED TO THE PROPHET MUHAMMAD BEGINNING WITH A SIMPLE WORD. IQRA. WHICH MEANS READ. WITH A SIMPLE YET POWERFUL PHRASE THE FAITH OF ISLAM UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF GAINING KNOWLEDGE TO BRING LIGHT INTO OUR HEARTS AND COMMUNITIES. RAMADAN THERE FOR THE TIME WHEN MUSLIMS REFLECT UPON THE WISDOM THE GUIDANCE THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PEACE THAT COMES FROM FAITH. AND RESPONSIBILITY OF HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TO ONE ONE ANOTHER AND TO GOD. LIKE MANY PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT FAITHS WHO HAVE SEEN RAMADAN THROUGH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES I KNOW THIS IS A FESTIVE TIME FOR THEM. A TIME WHEN FAMILIES GATHER IN BILLS THIS YEAR AND THEY FOCUS UPON THEIR FAITH IN THEIR BELIEF. THESE RITUALS REMIND US OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT ALL OF US HOLD IN COMMON. IN ISLAM ROLE IN ADVANCING JUSTICE PROGRESS TOLERANCE AND THE DIGNITY OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS. RAMADAN REMINDS OF THE RICHNESS BOZEMAN'S ADD TO THE RELIGIOUS TAPESTRY OF AMERICAN LIFE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE ALL BLESSED TO LIVE UNDER A CONSTITUTION OF FOSTER'S RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND RESPECTS RELIGIOUS PRACTICE. OUR CONSTITUTION ENSURES THAT MUSLIMS CAN OBSERVE RAMADAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR CONSCIENCE AND UNDER AN UNHINDERED BY GOVERNMENT. BUT JUST LIKE MANY IN OUR MINORITY COMMUNITIES MUSLIMS IN THE UNITED STATES FACE DISCRIMINATION. PACIFIC LIKE A KNOWN AS ISLAMOPHOBIA AND IT IS UP TO US TO ENSURE THAT WE UPHOLD OUR CONSTITUTION. PROTECT THEIR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN RIGHTS AND OF LIFT THEIR VOICE IN STORIES. NATIONALLY RUINS OF MUSLIMS HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES SPANNING BACK TO THE SLAVE TRADE. AND WHICH TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE ENSLAVED MEN AND WOMEN. WERE OF THE MUSLIM FAITH. WE SHOULD NEVER FORGET THIS ROUTE THAT WAS IMPORTANT IN DEVELOPING THIS NATION. THE CONCEPT OF FREEDOM AND LIBERTY AND JUSTICE ARE ROOTED IN THE AT OF THE MUSLIMS THAT WE HAVE. AND WE SHOULD NEVER ALLOW THEM TO BE MARGINALIZED OTHER RISE TO FEDERAL POLICIES AND TO ANTI MUSLIM RHETORIC. THERE ARE ONE POINT SIX BILLION MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE. AND CALIFORNIA'S HOME TO APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION. MUSLIM AMERICANS FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC AND CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS THEIR PRESENCE IN THE STATE AND NATION IN RICHES OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE STRONGER AS A STATE BECAUSE OF IT. IT IS INTERESTING THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT RELIGION WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE DIVISION THAT EXIST BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS. AND THERE BEEN WARS FOUGHT MORE WARS FOUGHT ABOUT RELIGION THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND YET WHEN WE STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES OF MOST RELIGIONS THEY'RE BASICALLY THE SAME PRINCIPLES THAT MOST OF US BELIEVE THEM. FAMILY LOVE THE COMMUNITY HELPING EACH OTHER REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER WORLD. AND YET WE SOMETIMES GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DIVISION AND THE DIFFERENCES RATHER THAN THE THE THINGS THAT BIND US TOGETHER. SO HOPEFULLY AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR MUSLIM BROTHERS AND SISTERS FASTING DURING RAMADAN A TIME WHEN THEY FAST IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHO THEY ARE TO GET TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT THEY BELIEVE IN. AND ALSO TO STRENGTHEN THEIR THEIR PRACTICE OF FAITH. AND THEIR TOLERANCE AND INVOLVEMENT WE STAND AND WE WISH THE MUSLIMS OF CALIFORNIA BEST WISHES ON RAMADAN. WE HOPE THEY WILL HAVE AN EARLY EVENING BARRACK WHICH MEANS A HAPPY OF THE CELEBRATION OF THEIR FAITH. DURING THIS MONTH OF RAMADAN AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS AND MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF OUT OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO ARE MUSLIMS IN THIS COUNTRY. WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AS MUSLIM WHO HAVE ADAPTED SOMETIMES TO SOME CHRISTIAN FAITH WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD ON TO THE MUSLIM IDEOLOGY?

AND WANT TO THANK HER FOR BRING THIS HISTORIC RESOLUTION TO OUR FLOOR. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE THE EMBARK MENT OF MANY OF OUR CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIRTY DAYS OF FASTING? REFLECTING OF RAMADAN. THE MONTH OF RAMADAN IS A TIME WHEN MUSLIMS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ABSTAIN FROM FOOD AND OR DRINK DURING THE LIFE HOURS. TO THE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES THIS MONTH IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST GIVING UP FOOD AND DRINK. IT IS A TIME OF TOGETHERNESS. WITH EACH OTHER THAT STRENGTHENS THE TIES OF THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. IT'S A TIME OF SPIRITUAL NOURISHMENT. THROUGH SELF REFLECTION AND THROUGH PRAYER. AND IT IS A TIME TO PRACTICE COMPASSION. FOR EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. RAMADAN FOSTERS A BEAUTIFUL BALANCE BETWEEN SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SELF KNOWLEDGE. MUSLIMS ARE ENCOURAGED TO SPEND TIME IN SELF RESPECT XIN. BUT ALSO TO BE PRESENT FOR ONE ANOTHER. IT IS A PROFOUND EXERCISE IN REALIZING THAT STRONG COMMUNITIES FIRST AND FOREMOST DEPEND ON SELF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT THERE IS NO SELF WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHERS. THESE ARE THE VALUES THAT I HOLD DEAR. AND REMIND ME OF THE SHARED VALUES MANY OF US PRACTICE. AND IT IS. I AM PROUD. TO BE UP LIFTING THEM AND CELEBRATING THEM TODAY THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION. RAMADAN REMINDS US THAT CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND POWERS MAY TRY TO CREATE DIVISIONS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES BY FOSTERING FEAR AND HATRED. OUR CORBELL USE OF HUMANITY. PEACE EQUITY AND JUSTICE ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF OUR FAITH. AND THAT OUR DIFFERENCES ONLY MAKE US STRONGER AS A STATE. AS A NATION AND AS A PEOPLE. I WAS HONORED TO ATTEND THE MUSLIM COMMUNITIES FOURTH ANNUAL IFTAR THAT THEY HAD LAST YEAR. AND WITNESSED A BEAUTIFUL GATHERING OF WHICH WE BROKE BREAD TOGETHER AT SUNSET.
