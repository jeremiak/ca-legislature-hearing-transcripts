WHAT'S A COMPELLING REASON

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.530
THERE WAS ANOTHER BILL. THAT

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:46.439
WAS. MOVING ON THAT LEFT OUT.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:49.241
LOCAL UTILITY. TAXES AND SO WE

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:49.875

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:50.476
WE'RE ABLE TO CLEAN THIS UP.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:52.311
AND THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY BEEN

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:52.812
SET UP BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.345
