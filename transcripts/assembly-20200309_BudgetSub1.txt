OF TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE UNTIL WE ESTABLISH QUORUM I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE PANEL FOR ISSUE ONE. TO COME FORWARD. WHEN YOU'RE READY SURGEON GENERAL AND APOLOGIES I DID NOT SEE EDUARDO GARCIA WE WILL- TAKE YOU NEXT ON THE AGENDA SO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TIME DOCTOR NEEDING BURKE KERIS CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL. MY NAME IS MATT SCHILLER ALSO WITH THE OFFICERS SURGEON GENERAL. FOR ME TO HAND IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH AMY BERMAN FINANCE. SONNY BETTER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WHEN YOU'RE READY. SEC THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS- SPENT THE PAST YEAR WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE SAYS ON THE FIRST IN THE NATION EFFORT TO- TRAIN PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS TO SCREEN. TO SCREEN FOR AT CHILDREN AND ADULTS FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND RESPOND WITH TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. THIS HAS BEEN AN EXCITING- INITIATIVE AT WITH A BUDGET OF ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS AND REPRESENTS REALLY THE CORNERSTONE OF CALIFORNIA'S- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE- ACES AWARE INITIATIVE. AND AS WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH FIRST ESTABLISHING THIS TRAINING FOR OUR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WE RECOGNIZE THAT ADDRESSING- TRAUMA AN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES DOESN'T BEGIN AND END IN THE EXAM ROOM BUT RATHER- WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO ADDRESSING- ACES AND TOXIC STRESS AS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND FOR THAT REASON- WE HAVE REQUESTED- FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY A NUMBER ONE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF PREVENTION AND- NUMBER TWO TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE AND CROSS SECTOR TRAINING TO TRAIN OTHER- PROVIDERS OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH THE SPECIALTY. INCLUDING EARLY CHILDHOOD PROVIDERS EDUCATORS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- GOVERNMENT WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS- CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY AS A RISK FACTOR AND RESPOND WITH TRAUMA INFORMED PRINCIPLES AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO ME NOT FOR THE DETAILS. SO AS PART OF THE PURPOSE WE'RE REQUESTING A TOTAL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS EIGHT MILLION OF WHICH IS- DIRECTED AT THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN- TO REACH THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS A LOT OF FOR THE CROSS SECTOR TRAINING- BROADLY ACROSS- FOUR SECTORS- EARLY CHILDHOOD- WORKERS- EDUCATION WORKERS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN MORE GENERALLY GOVERNMENT WORKERS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON IS LA- AS ANY PARTICULARLY- WE UST HAVE ONE MINOR ISSUE WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE LIKE TO REYES- THE PROPOSAL CURRENTLY INCLUDES BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXEMPT ALL OF THE CONTRACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS- FUNDING FROM THE- ENTIRE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE THE- MISTER SCHULER AND OTHER STAFF OF OFFERED- GOOD JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY SOME OF THE FUND. WHITE MAKE MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING EXEMPT FROM THE CONTRACT CODE- FOR EXAMPLE THE HOPE TO LEVERAGE- PARTNERSHIPS WITH PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL AGENCIES AND BUSINESSESTHAT MIGHT NOT. BE QUITE THE TRADITIONAL CONTRACTING RELATIONSHIP- AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALL THEY WILL LIKELY BE RUNNING AN AD CAMPAIGN- WHICH- WE THINK WOULD. BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE TRADITIONAL CONTRACTING PROCESS. WE ALSO KNOW THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CONTRACTING CODE SERVES AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC PURPOSE WHICH IS TO ENSURE THE PROPER USE OF STATE FUNDS SO WE SUGGEST EIGHTY A MINOR. REVISION TO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE- WHICH WOULD SORT OF DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TYPES OF CONTRACTS THEY MIGHT ENTER INTO AND REQUIRE- THE OFFICE TO FOLLOW THE PUBLIC COUNTRY CODE FOR THOSE CONTRACTS THAT ARE MORE LIKE- TRADITIONAL COMPETITIVE BIDS. THANK CAN WE HAVE A REPORT IF I MAY SO THAT THE LA- DID RAISE THAT QUESTION EARLIER AND WE ARE CERTAINLY AMENABLE TO WORKING WITH ALL THE LA- HAND THE- SUBCOMMITTEE CONSULTANTS IN ORDER TO BETTER REFINE THAT LANGUAGE AND REALLY GET TO THE- TO THE READER THAT ISSUE THAT SOME YOU JUST.

THAT DAY WE'RE- THANK YOU THERE THE ASUS AWARE DOT ORG INITIATIVE IS A- HAS IS A BROAD INITIATIVE THAT HAS BEEN- STOOD UP TO BE THE UMBRELLA UNDER WHICH CALIFORNIA'S- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE INITIATIVE RESIGNS. TO DATE ALL OF THE EFFORTS OF THE ASUS AWARE INITIATIVE HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS- USING MEDICAID AND PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER INITIATIVE THAT WOULD DRIVE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION- ASPECT OF THAT WORK THAT WOULD ALSO SIT UNDER ACES AWARE- UMBRELLA- BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE DIFFERENT. FUNDING SOURCE YES. THANK YOU- WITH THAT I- BELIEVE WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPENED FOR NOW BUT MAY I ASK YOU AS THE SURGEON GENERAL TO STAY FOR THE NEXT FEW ISSUES IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE TO. AS WE HAVE A PILOT FOR ALL CHILDREN THRIVE IN A FEW STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS RELATED TO TRAUMA THAT MIGHT INTEREST SO. WITH THAT I'M GOING TO HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN THANK THIS PANEL AND INVITE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA TO COME UP WITH GUARDING ISSUE THREE. YEAH. WHEN YOU'RE READY ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COLLEAGUES. WHAT WAS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PRESENTING THAT WHAT I WOULD CALL A MODEST- ASK FOR THE NATIONAL BUT IS NETWORK QUESTION TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALLING FOR CARE AT TRAINING OF EDUCATORS AND WITH ME IS BE A THREE ONE SALAS- EDUCATOR WHO'S A DEDICATED NEARLY TWO DECADES OF SERVICE TO THE JOB I UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS A COORDINATOR FOR EXPANDED LEARNING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THIS CAPACITY- SHE SURE IS THE QUALITY PROGRAM FOR TWENTY ONE SCHOOL SITES AND OVERSEES THE PROP FORTY SEVEN.

SHE IS TO TELL TINA WOMAN OF THE YEAR. SO YOU ARE THE GREAT TO WITNESS HERE TODAY FROM DISTRICTS OF. THE FOR SERVICE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAS INTRODUCED BY MY FAVORITE ASSEMBLYMAN A LOT OF. MY NAME IS A B. GONZALEZ AND I PLAY MANY ROLES IN THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING THAT REPRESENT MEANS SUPERVISOR MENU PER AS AS A BEHAVIOR HEALTH COMMISSIONER. ALSO SERVICE AND ON THE- DOES OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OARD AND CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY LATINO COMMISSION. AND SERVING THE STUDENTS OF THE DISTRICT AS A COORDINATOR FOR EXPENDED LEARNING PROGRAMS I COULD TELL OF A LEE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE BEFORE YOU. REPRESENTING THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE NATIONAL COMBAT IS NETWORK THROUGH OUR PROP FORTY SEVEN FUNDED LEARNING COMMUNITYFOR SCHOOL SUCCESS PROGRAM GRANT. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. DEVELOP A DEEP RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMBAT ISN'T LIKE. THEY DO WORK NATIONALLY BUT THERE LOCALLY SERVING NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE COACHELLA VALLEY CENTRAL VALLEY BAY AREA. AND WE ARE LOOKING TO HELP THEM EXPAND RIGHT THERE ARE CALIFORNIA. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT THE NATIONAL COMBAT IS NETWORK HAS WORKED WITH ORGANIZATIONS AND SYSTEMS TO TRANSFORM. THE APPROACH THEY EMPLOY WHEN DELIVERING SERVICES THAT ARE OFFERED TO CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEIR APPROACHES TO WORK ALONGSIDE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING CHILDREN EDUCATORS SCHOOL PERSONNEL YOUTH PARENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS INTENTIONALLY TRANSFORM MEAN AND NOT TRANSFERRING TRAUMA. BY FACILITATING THE PROCESS THAT HELPS THEM RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS ENCOUNTER TRAUMA. THEY ALSO ADVOCATE FOR SERVICES THAT ARE CULTURAL AND HEALING CENTER. THIS APPROACH OF COMMUNITY HERE LEAN EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES THROUGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RECOGNIZE AND OR REDISCOVER THE CULTURAL TRADITIONS. THEY CARRY WITH THEM THEM AND HELP THEM TO HE NOT ONLY THEMSELVES. THE PAST IN FUTURE GENERATIONS OF. THE GENERATION OF TRAUMA. THE WORK FOR THE NATIONAL COMBAT IS NETWORK IS UNIQUE BECAUSE TRAUMA AFFECTS NOT ONLY BUILDER. BUT THE ADULTS AROUND IN THEM FOR MOST FOR THEIR YOUNG LIVES. THAT DON'T ACTION TO STUDENT AB ISM YOUR FAX. IF YOU'RE IS. THAT IS THE BEGAN WITH AN OUR SCHOOLS SUSPENSE AND EXPULSIONS HAVE DECREASED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE HAVE ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE SUSPENSIONS AND SEVENTEEN EXPULSIONS THE YEAR AFTER AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAD ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN SUSPENSIONS AND ELEVEN NEXT WELL SINCEIN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAD ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE SUSPENSIONS AND SEVEN EXPULSIONS SO DURING THE THREE YEARS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION SO PENSIONS WERE REDUCED. BY A HUNDRED NINETY SIX WE HAD HIM LESS EXPULSION. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE EIGHT SCORED IS NOT DETERMINED BY THE LEVEL OF ADULT EDUCATION TRAUMA FIX THAT ONLY ADULTS MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND THEN HEALTHY ADULT WILL TRANSFER TRAUMA TO A CHILD WITHOUT INTENTION BUT CONTINUE TO CREATE TRAUMATIZED CHILDREN. BY ADDRESSING THE DAHLE REACTION TO STUDENT BEHAVIOR WE CAN CONTINUE TO DECREASE. CANADA PUNISHMENT WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO SECURE TWO MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING NATIONAL COMBAT IS NETWORK WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPAND TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF IMPLEMENTATION INCLUDING WHOLE SCHOOL IMMERSION AND WORKSHOPS FOR THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES MORE ADULTS ADDRESSING THEIR TRAUMA WILL ALLOW FOR THE HEALING PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE THIS CULTURALLY HOLISTIC APPROACH ADDRESSES ROOTED ISSUES WHICH EXIST WITHIN OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO TRANSFORM IN TRAUMA AND NOT TRANSFERRING DRUM. MUCH LIKE A DOCTOR HARRIS'S STORY WE'RE ADDRESSING WHAT'S IN THE WELL.

SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK IT'S A SURPRISE THAT WE'VE BEEN QUITE SUPPORTIVE OF ACES AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE WORKED- I THINK WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE COMMITTEE IN GENERAL IS THAT WE STARTED A PILOT TWO YEARS AGO THE ALL CHILDREN THRIVE. AND REALLY ARE LOOKING TOWARDS THAT AS WHAT. WILL HELP TO GIVE US SOME OF THE IDEAS MUCH LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING HERE. AND SO I'M MAY ASK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO.

AND I APOLOGIZE FOR JUMPING BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO COMMENTS REGARDING ISSUE FIVE. WE WILL HEAR ISSUE FIVE AFTER WE HEAR ISSUE TO. AT. NO. MORALES ROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I'M JUST HERE TO KIND OF GIVE YOU A LIVER BACKGROUND ON WHERE WE ARE AT- WITHOUT THE CONSTANT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE ORCHARD DR PROGRAM SO JUST AS A REMINDER THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALLOCATED TEN MILLION IN A ONE TIME BASIS FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND TO SUPPORT THE ORCHARD DR PILOT PROJECT FROM JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. TO JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FIRST OF THESE FUNDS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ALLOCATED ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AS WELL AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION THREE MANY NINE MILLION DOLLARS WAS AWARDED- VIA- THIRTY MONTH CONTRACT TO THE COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS THE FIRST AGENTS FOR THIS PROJECT. WHAT'S UP CONTRACTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTHY CHILDREN FAMILIES COMMUNITIES TO IMPLEMENT THE PROJECT. THE ALL CHILDREN THRIVE CALIFORNIA PILOT PROJECT WILL TEST THE PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO PREVENTING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA COUNTER ITS EFFECTS AND FOSTER INDIVIDUAL FAMILY AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO PASS IT ALONG TO THE FOR FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND DOING SOME OF THE GREAT WORK. WONDERFUL THANK SO MUCH IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THANKS- THE OPPORTUNITY GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE- PRETTY MUCH HALFWAY THROUGH- ARE FUNDING IT GOES QUICK. SO AS WE JUST HEARD A AND YOU ALL KNOW WELL AND THIS IS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY TO PREVENT. ACES TO COUNTER THEIR EFFECTS TO PROMOTE HEALING TO FOSTER INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN ORDER TO GIVE ALL CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO THRIVE- REGIONALLY WAS THREE YEARS OF MONEY BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT IT'S DOWN TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AND SO WE HAVE- WE'RE JUST ABOUT HALFWAY THERE- PARTNERS IS AS WE SAID PUBLIC OUT THAT BUCKETS- DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE PARTNERS AND YOU SEE LA. HERE'S I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN MY THIRTY YEARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH THIS IS% THE MOST. MEANINGFUL WORK THAT I'VE EVER DONE. SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE- COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATURE FOR FUNDING THIS THE FOCUS IS ON PREVENTION THIS IS ABOUT COMMUNITY LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGIES TO PREVENT TRAUMA. AND PROMOTE CHILD WELL BEING THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ACES THESE DAYS. OF MOST OF THE TALK IS ABOUT MEASURING ACES AND DEALING WITH THEM ONCE THEY'RE THERE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PREVENTING THEM FROM HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH. OUR FOCUS IS ON CITIES TYPICALLY IT'S COUNTIES THAT HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HEALTH ISSUES AND YET PEOPLE LIVE IN CITIES. PEOPLE IDENTIFY IN CITIES AND MUCH OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE ARE RESULT OF LET'S THEIR AND WHAT'S PROVIDED IN THE CITY'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND AGAIN THIS IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL WE'RE LOOKING AT SUSTAINABLE CHANGE BY ENACTING POLICIES. RE ENGINEERING SYSTEMS LEVERAGING NEW AND EXISTING FUNDING INCLUDING HAT NEW AND EXISTING FUNDING IS THE PROP SIXTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING THERE IS FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS DEDICATED TO PREVENTION- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT COULD BE GOING INTO COMMUNITIES- TO BE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK THAT'S EVIDENCE BASED WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS TO CREATE AN ECO SYSTEM IN COMMUNITIES. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND SUPPORT THIS ISN'T ABOUT ONE. MAGIC I DON'T WANNA SAY BULLET MAGIC- ANTIDOTE HELPFUL SAY BUT THE TERM. MAGIC ONE THANK YOU- THIS IS ABOUT REALLY CHANGING THE ECOSYSTEM RIGHT NOW WE LIVE IN IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOSTLY BASED ON- ECONOMIC DRIVERS- POLITICAL DRIVERS MUCH OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND WE SEE THE EFFECTS OF THAT. RESIDENT VOICES WERE REALLY LOOKING AT TURNING THINGS UPSIDE DOWN SO THAT RESIDENT VOICES ARE DRIVING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES THAT THE PRIORITIES ARE BEING SET BY RESIDENTS THEMSELVES IT'S THE RESIDENTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO PARENTS YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN COLLABORATION WITH THIS IS- KEY IS. LEVERAGING WHAT WORKS TO HELP OTHER PLACES BUILD ON IT TO DO WHAT WORKS AND- SUPPORTING EACH OTHER TO GET EVER BETTER. MANDATED IN LEGISLATION IS A FIFTEEN MEMBER EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP I WILL SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH. THEY REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY- GENDER DIVERSITY ETHNIC DIVERSITY- OF CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY ARE. THEY'RE DRIVING THE SHIP ON THIS AND- I LEARNED FROM THEM EVERY DAY SO THEY ARE GUIDING THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INITIATIVE TO ENSURE THAT ACT NURTURES THE WISDOM AND CREATIVITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES- I WILL SAY THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT SIXTY YEAR OLD WHITE MAN WEARING. NICE SILK TIES THINK SHOULD BE HAPPENING THIS IS ABOUT- WHAT COMMUNITIES- KNOW NEEDS TO HAPPEN THERE IS A WISDOM AND A DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND WHAT IS GOING ON THAT REALLY- NEEDS TO DRIVE THE SHIP AND IS DRIVING THIS SHIP- SO THEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE HISTORICAL AN INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND OPPRESSION. THAT HAS- SO LONG BEEN GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES AND THEY GET THAT BY DOING THIS WE'RE GOING TO BE PROMOTING TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY IN COLLABORATION. THAT THE WAY COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA BE WORKING IN THIS IS IF THEY KNOW THEIR VOICES MATTER AND THAT- THE HISTORY OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH- IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED. AND ALL OF THIS IN ORDER TO PARTICULARLY BENEFIT CHILDREN FROM THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE THE GREATEST INEQUITIES. THE FIRST THING THAT COULD ADVISORY GROUP DID WAS COME UP WITH THEIR VALUES AND IT IS THESE VALUES THAT ARE- AGAIN DRIVING THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING PRIORITIZING CHILDREN AND YOUTH FOCUSING STRICTLY ON WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED NOTHING ELSE FOCUSING ON INNOVATION UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE KIND OF INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE IN COMMUNITIES- HAVE RESULTED FROM THE STATUS QUO WE NEED TO BE THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. AGAIN I ADDRESSED- ALLUDED TO THIS IS POWER SHIFTING RE ORGANIZING MUNICIPAL STRUCTURES SO THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF HISTORICALLY- DIS INVESTED CHILDREN. AND SERVANT LEADERSHIP- WE HAVE A REALLY REMARKABLE- POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES. I KNOW LOTS OF CITY OFFICIALS THEY WANT TO DO THE BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP AND FROM LISTENING SESSIONS IS. THAT CITIES CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF LISTENING AND- SERVING RATHER THAN ASSUMING. THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S BEST THERE'S NOTHING LIKELY TO CA. NAM SAY SOME MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THAT- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SUBCONTRACTORS THAT WE HIRED ONE GROSS IS A HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN FIRM THAT- ARRANGED FOR A WHOLE SERIES OF COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS ALL DESCRIBE THE FINDINGS OF THOSE- NEXT. WE HAVE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM WE'VE WORKED WITH UC DAVIS WE NOW HAVE CITY LEVEL ACES DATA THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO EVERY CITY IN THE STATE. WE JUST FINISHED A JOB. ON FRIDAY THE RESULTS FROM PUBLIC A PUT THAT PUBLIC OPINION POLLING DATA. SIX THOUSAND- REGISTERED VOTERS ASKING THEM WHAT DO THEY SEE AS THE- PRIMARY ISSUES AROUND TRAUMA. FACING KIDS- WORKING VASES CONNECTION LONG LONG STANDING- WELL RESPECTED ORGANIZATION- THAT HAS- COALITIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GONNA BE HOSTING OUR OUTREACH. AND LEARNING NETWORK. AND WE'VE HIGHER COURT INK TO DO. THE EVALUATION SO WE STARTED ALL OF THIS WITH A SERIES OF LISTENING SESSIONS IN SEVEN COMMUNITIES IN A SEE THAT THEIR THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- DIFFERENT SIZE DIFFERENT GRAPHICS. WE INTERVIEWED- AND THE CONSULTANTS WONDERS INTERVIEWED CITY LEVEL- LEADERS EXPERTS IN DIFFERENT FIELDS- INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND THEN- IN THOSE FIVE COMMUNITIES WE HAD COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS. WHERE RESIDENTS THEMSELVES TOLD US WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE AND THIS IS WHAT WE HEARD. WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES STABLE HOME LIFE EARLY CHILD IN RICHMOND FEELING SAFE IN THEIR CITY AND I WILL SAY I WAS SURPRISED QUALITY FOOD OPTIONS ARE ORGANIZATIONS TO WORK IN ON OBESITY RELATED ISSUES AND- AND FOOD AVAILABILITY FOR A LONG TIME- IT IS STILL ONE OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES THAT IS THAT. FAMILIES ARE. WHAT'S HOLDING COMMUNITIES BACK HOW HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING CAME UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN THREATS OF VIOLENCE LACK OF PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT FOR YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND THE LACK OF AVAILABLE SERVICES. WHEN THEY WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. SERVICES AND HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FOLKS FOR DOUBLE HOUSING FOR ALL IN IN GENERAL HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT. I'M THEIR DREAMS HI I WILL SAY THIS WAS ONE OF THE- IT WAS A REALLY MOVING- FINDINGS. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY NOT WANTING TO STRUGGLE ACCESS TO COLLEGE WITH THE ABILITY TO GET BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WE HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN PEOPLE WANT TO BE PART OF COMMUNITIES THAT'S BOTH- A SOURCE OF HEALING AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE HEALING TO OTHERS. SO THE PRIORITY IN PENSIONS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH- AND AT EIGHT COME UP WITH. THE WITH RESIDENT INTERVIEWS AND LISTENING SESSIONS INTERVIEWS THE CITY LEADERS AND THIS PUBLIC OPINION POLLING. WHAT WE WANTED TO DO THEIR AT THEIR AND INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT OULD BE GOOD COULD BE GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT IS IT THAT MOST COMMUNITIES MOST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHAT IS IT THAT. WHEN I SEE WHAT IS IT THAT THERE ARE LEFT SHOWS ARE INTERESTED. WHAT IS IT NOT IN THESE. CITIES THAT WE WORK IN BUT OVERALL WHAT IS IT THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE INTERESTED IN DOING. AND IF WE CAN FIND IT IN INTERSECTION WE CAN FIND SOME SWEET PLACES. WHERE SOME SWEET SPOTS WHERE LOTS OF MOMENTUM CAN- BE DEVELOPED. AND SO WE- WERE PUTTING TOGETHER A TOOL KIT WHAT WE'RE CALLING CHANGE PACKAGES FOR EACH OF THESE PRIORITY IS. THE MENTAL HEALTH WHAT WE WHAT WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IS IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE WANT THERAPY WHAT PEOPLE WANT IS COMMUNITY SUPPORT THIS IS STUFF THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE IT JUST TAKES ORGANIZING. SUPPORT GROUPS NONTRADITIONAL CULTURALLY- RESPONSIVE SUPPORT FOR WHAT'S GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES BEFORE THE TRAUMA HAPPENS IT COULD BE AFTER THE TRAUMA HAPPENS TO BUT THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING. YOUNG PEOPLE WITH WHAT THEY NEED ALONG. REALLY CHILD ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS THIS IS ABOUT HAVING PROGRAMS IN NEIGHBORHOODS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES- SUPPORT PARENTS IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OTHER. AND WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CHILDREN. YES EIGHT HOUSE IN AUSTIN SECURITY WHEN AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALL THE LEGISLATURE DOING A LOT BETTER ADDRESS THE HOUSING ISSUE RESIDENTS ARE LOOKING FOR THAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT WHAT WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS- SOMETHING THAT WE TRANSLATED INTO- WHAT WE HEARD WAS LOOKING AT PUBLIC SAFETY IS MORE THAN JUST POLICE AND FIRE WHAT IS IT THAT CAN HAPPEN IN COMMUNITIES SO THAT KIDS FEEL SAFE ARE SAFE. AND HAVE SUPPORT- TO- TO LIVE IN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT IS- THAT IS SAFE AND LOOKING AT THAT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AND ONE OF THE OVER ARCHING PIEES IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AGAIN IS MAKING SURE THAT RESIDENTS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THEMSELVES ARE INVOLVED IN THE MAKING FOR THE COMMUNITY. X. WE'RE NOW IN THE PROP. OF TO WHAT WITH IN THIS CITIES OF THE CITIES WERE. WORKING WE OUR THAT WE DID THE GROUPS AND YOU CAN SEE THE OF SIT OF SEVEN A- WE GONNA BE FOCUSING ON HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMITTEES COLOR WE HAVE THIS DATA NOW THE ACES HOW WITH WHAT THE ACES. ARE IN COMMUNITIES WE'RE GONNA BE WORK WITH THOSE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CITY IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS WHO WHO WHO ARE TO BE. YES WORK- AND WE WANT TO AT LEAST TO START WE WANT TO WORK IN PLACES WHERE THERE'S POLITICAL WILL AND WHEN I SAY POLITICAL WILL I DON'T MEAN JUST THE ELECTED OFFICIALS I MEAN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND- RESTED OF CAN. LEADER WILLING ABLE ATTY TO WORK TOGETHER. PHASE ONE. THESE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A OUR FIRST MEETING OUR CITY TO TEAM IN TODAY- IN EACH CITY WERE IDENTIFYING A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD WE HAVE FUNDING- FROM ALL CHILDREN CALIFORNIA- TO- PROVIDE GRANTS TO THESE- TO THESE TEAMS. JAMES CAN BE MADE OF ADULTS YOUTH CITY LEADER AND SOMEONE FROM THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH THIS IS MY PASSION OUR GOAL AGAIN IS WE- CITIES TO BE OPENED THESE COLD. IT WITH THE TAP INTO M. A. S. A. MONEY. THE VALUES THAT THE EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP CAME UP WITH HIS VALUES THAT WE WANT- AND THEY WANT IN FUSE THROUGHOUT THE WORK SO WE'RE ASKING THOSE DESIGN TEAMS TO COMMIT TO- THOSE VALUES THEY CAN ADD TO THE- AS THEY WISH AND THEN ESTABLISH THIS IS SOMETHING WE LEARNED FROM OUR HEALTHY EATING ACTIVE LIVING CITIES CAMPAIGN THE FIRST PERSON HE'S- TO BE. UP THE TRAJECTORY OF CHANGE IS FOR THE CITIES TO PASS A RESOLUTION IT'S NOT JUST HAPPY THURSDAY RESOLUTION IT'S A RESOLUTION COMMITTING TO VERY SPECIFIC STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT A CHANGE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. NEXT WITH THAT FUNDING AND THE TEAM IS GONNA CONDUCT LISTENING SESSIONS TO IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITY PRIORITIES- THE CITY'S THEN ONCE THOSE PRIORITIES ARE SET THE CITIES THAT ARE WORKING ON SIMILAR PRIORITIES AND BE A PART OF THE LEARNING COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GET TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS RESOURCE AND APPROACH IS AND THEN THEY BIG TO X. AND IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATE WHAT THEY PUT FORWARD. TIMELINE HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON EXT- DESIGN TEAMS GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN IN THOSE CITIES. LAUNCH WEBINARS SUPPORT FOR CITY LEADERS AND COMMUNITIES AND- COME JUNE MONEY'S GONNA BE GOING OUT THE DOOR TO THESE COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM BEGIN DOING THIS WORK. OF LEARNING NETWORK STARTING EARLY IN SUMMER WITH THE END GOAL OF ALL OF THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING CITIES IMPLEMENTING PLANS TWENTY CITIES ADOPTING RESOLUTION SIXTY CITIES IN GAUGING ALL CHILDREN THRIVE BY THE END OF THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- I WILL SAY FOR THE PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE LEAGUE. OF WHEN THIS. AS THIS STARTS GOING THERE ARE CITIES ALL OVER THE PLACE THIS IS A REALLY A TOP PRIORITY OF ISSUES THAT CITIES WANT TO WORK IN AND FOR US TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGIES TO FOCUS ON BRINGING CITIES TOGETHER CITY LEADERS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND RESIDENTS TOGETHER TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PRIORITIES TO DEVELOP THE ECOSYSTEM OF CHANGE. IT'S IMPORTANT WORK AND I DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ON. PUBLIC COMMENT ISSUE. TO SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE FOR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I HAVE A FEW IF I MAY UM.

IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I DON'T HAVE IT I I'LL I'LL LET YOU KNOW PERFECT- YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A CITY RESOLUTION THAT YOU'D LIKE MULTIPLE CITIES TO PASS. DO YOU HAVE A PROPOSED RESOLUTION YEAH SO WHAT WE'RE GOING WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE HAVE IS A IS A- A MODEL RESOLUTION THAT THAT RED RESIDENTS COMMUNITIES THESE TEAMS ARE GOING TO MODIFY- AS THEY AS THEY WANT BUT WHAT WE KNOW FROM. WORKING WITH TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE CITIES OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS ON OBESITY RELATED ISSUES IS A MODEL IS REALLY HELPFUL SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH THEIR BLANKS IN THERE THEY CAN PUT THEIR OWN DATA IN THERE. AND AGAIN THEY CAN THEY CAN MODIFY IT AS THEY WILL BUT IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE A TEMPLATE. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE A- OPINION POLL WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE IS A- I WOULD HAVE.

WHEN YOU'RE READY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES SOME. I'M HERE TODAY AS A CHAMPION FOR LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL FOR REQUEST OF SIX MILLION DOLLARS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. WHICH IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO. THE FUNDING IS FOR THREE YEARS TO FIND A PILOT TRAUMA INFORMED MODEL PROGRAM. FOR CHILD ABUSE VICTIMS IN OUR AREA THAT ENCOMPASSES THE INLAND EMPIRE. WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CHILDREN WELFARE SYSTEM. THE PROGRAM NOW SERVES CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND BEYOND INCLUDING THE COUNTIES OF SALMON YOU KNOW AND RIVERSIDE. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE PROPOSALS THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL WILL FUND AN EXPANSION OF SERVICES THERE ARE MULTIPLE MULTI DISCIPLINARY IT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE SUFFERING. AND VIOLENCE THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE ENTERED DO NOT DEFINE THEIR FUTURE. DECEMBER DINO ALONE. ALTHOUGH REPORT REPORTED CASES OF CHILD ABUSE NUMBER APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ONLY A NARROW SUBSET OF THOSE CHILDREN THE MOST SERIOUS CASES ARE REFERRED TO THE SALMON YOU KNOW COUNTY CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER. THOSE ARE CASES OF RECENT SEXUAL ABUSE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SPECIFIC INJURIES SUCH AS BRUISES AND BURNS HERE WITH ME TODAY. IS DOCTOR AMY YOUNG SNODGRASS. DIVISION CHIEF OF THE CHILDREN'S PEDIATRICS FOR LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. THANK YOU. I FEEL SO LUCKY TO BE ON NOT ON SORRY. STERN NOW I AM A KNOW. THERE I FEEL SO TO BE HERE TODAY AS A PHYSICIAN MOSTLY WORKING IN THE TRENCH I AM ONE OF ONLY LESS THAN FOUR HUNDRED PHYSICIANS BOARD CERTIFIED IN CHILD ABUSE PEDIATRICS ACROSS THE NATION- I'M REALLY IN AWE TO SEE WHAT'S BEING DONE AT THIS LEVEL TO TAKE CARE OFTHE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY. I WILL KEEP THIS TO ST- I HAVE BEEN A CHILD ABUSE PHYSICIAN AT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. AND I'VE TREATED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT I AM HERE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO TO PROPOSE A PILOT PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A TRAUMA INFORMED MEDICAL HOME MODEL FOR ABUSED AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH IS THE PLACE I WAS BORN AND RAISED. THIS PROPOSAL COMES IN GREAT PART DUE TO MY EXPERIENCES IN THIS FIELD. NOT LONG AGO I WAS CALLED TO THE BEDSIDE OF A CRITICALLY INJURED CHILD A BABY WHO HAD SUFFERED MULTIPLE MODALITIES OF INJURY THAT WERE SUSPICIOUS AND UNEXPLAINED. I MET WITH THE FATHER AS I NORMALLY DO TOGETHER HISTORY. DURING THE HISTORY TAKING IN ALL TALKING ABOUT HIS BABY'S INJURIES THE FATHER ENDED UP TELLING ME THAT AS A CHILD HE HAD BEEN IN MORE FOSTER HOMES THAN HE COULD REMEMBER. HE SUFFERED ABUSE IN FOSTER CARE AND THROUGHOUT HIS CHILDHOOD. REPORTED TO ME THAT HE SAW THERAPISTS AND CONSISTENTLY AND HAD MANY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. WHEN HE TURNED EIGHTEEN HE WAS TIRED OF BEING A FOSTER YOUTH HE LEFT THE SYSTEM BECAME HOMELESS AND THEN BECAME A FATHER. WHEN I SAT WITH HIM SOMETHING WAS VERY FAMILIAR TO ME. HE EVENTUALLY TOLD ME ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED HIM TO FOSTER CARE IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN THE MOMENTS THAT CHANGED MY LIFE HE SHOWED ME SCARS ON HIS HANDS FROM ABUSE. AND THAT'S WHEN I REMEMBERED. HE WAS FAMILIAR BECAUSE I WAS THE PHYSICIAN WHO MADE THE DIAGNOSIS OF ABUSE WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY. DESPITE TAKING EVERY ACTION THAT I KNEW TO HELP HIM AND TO BREAK THE CYCLES OF ABUSE I WAS NOW THERE TO WATCH AS HE WAS ARRESTED FOR FATAL INJURIES THAT HE CAUGHT CHILD. THIS STORY IS NOT UNUSUAL OR RARE. CHILD ABUSE IS A PERVASIVE PREVALENT DISEASE PROCESS AMONG OUR CHILDREN. WHEN I HEARD DOCTOR BURKE KERRY SPEAK SEVERAL YEARS AGO MY WORLD WAS ROCKED SHE QUOTED A FELLOW CHILD ABUSE PHYSICIAN WHO SAID THAT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE THE SINGLE GREATEST UNADDRESSED PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT FACING OUR NATION TODAY. SHE TOOK MY WORK OUT OF THE DARK CORNERS OF MEDICINE AND TOLD THE NATION THAT WE ARE SICK IN PART BECAUSE WE DOT DO NOT DO ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE SUFFERED ABUSE AND NEGLECT. PHYSICIANS ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT ACES AND LEARNING HOW TO ASK DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN TAUGHT THIS IN OUR TRAINING. THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE NOW ARE NOT ENOUGH. THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE TIME AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING THAT IS REQUIRED TO DELIVER TRAUMA INFOMED TO MEDICAL CARE. OR THE TREATMENT TEAMS NEEDED TO MEET A CHILD'S SPECIAL NEEDS. MEDICAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS EXIST IN SILOS.

WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A HOSPITAL BE PENALIZED FOR EXPANDING THE SERVICES THEY OFFER IN THAT AREA. AND WE ALSO WANT TO WATCH AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF TERTIARY CENTERS. THAT WE DON'T CREATE INCENTIVES FOR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS FOR EXAMPLE TO CUT SERVICE LINES THAT DON'T MAKE A LOT OF PROFIT OR THAT ARE REALLY COSTS CENTRIC.

MISTER MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE MORE- NEARLY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND MEMBERS ASKED ME CALIFORNIA- WE ARE PROBABLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT BEHIND- THE ESTABLISHMENT OFFICE OF. HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. WE THINK IS CRUCIAL- THAT WE DO TAKE MORE STEPS AS A STATE TO CONTROL THE COST OF HEALTHCARE WE KNOW THIS GROWING AS YOU'VE HEARD- IN GREAT DETAIL HERE- WE ALSO KNOW THAT WORKERS WHEN THEY COME TO THE TABLE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR- DISS ACOSTA AS IT GROWS IT TAKES MONEY OFF OF THE TABLES. OF WORKING PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE NEED IT- WHO NOW HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES ABOUT- YOU KNOW. WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE SO WE THINK THIS IS CRITICAL. AS A UNION THAT REPRESENTS WORKERS I IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS- WE ALSO THINK THAT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE- HAVE THE EQUITY AT NIGHT AND- BUT- THE- GUIDELINES IN PLACE THAT ENSURE THAT. THE SAVINGS THAT ARE- THAT COME FROM A PROGRAM LIKE THIS ARE BORN ON THE BACKS OF WORKERS- BUT WE ARE- CONCEPTUALLY REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.

SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE I WILL NOW ASK THE PANEL FOR ISSUE FIVE TO COME FORWARD. AND IF WE CAN START WITH ALICE CHAN PLEASE. IT'S A SIGN GREAT. MY NAME IS DR ALICE CHEN AND THE DEPUTY. DIRECTORPOLICY IN PLANNING AND DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL AFFAIRS FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE FOR ABILITY I WILL SAY- IT IS HEARTENING THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF. OF THE CONCEPT OF THIS OFFICE IT IS ALSO SOBERING TO SEE THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF AGE GENDER GEOGRAPHY. RACE ETHNICITY ANY WHO ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THIS- SO START BY SAYING- OBVIOUSLY. AFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH CARE IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS IT IS- ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S TOP PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS. AND AS SUCH- THIS OFFICE IS ONE OF THE MINISTRY. IN MINISTRATIONS SIGNATURE PROPOSALS- IT IS REALLY. PROMISED ON FOR GUIDING PRINCIPLE SO FIRST- WE NEED A CLEAR GOAL IF WE DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THERE SO SETTING A STATEWIDE PER CAPITA COST TARGET. FOR A YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE IN COST. SECOND ALL IN EVERY SECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY HAS A ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY TO PLAY IN GETTING US TO THAT TARGET. THIRD ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ANTICIPATE AND HOPE THAT BY SETTING A CLEAR GOAL- CHANGE WILL HAPPEN AND THE SYSTEM ALL LINE BUT IN CASE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN WE HAVE- MECHANISM FOR PER PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT AND LASTLY THAT- WE NSURE THAT SAVINGS A CREW BACK TO CONSUMERS SO THOSE ARE THE FOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES- I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THE KEY COMPONENTS SO IN TERMS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND PLACEMENT- BECAUSE THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR- THIS WILL BE AN OFFICE WITHIN THE AGENCY WITH THE DIRECTOR APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. THERE WILL BE ELEVEN MEMBER ADVISORY BOARD WITH BROAD EXPERTISE REPRESENTING THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BOARD ADVISES THE DIRECTOR AND ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THE OFFICES WORK. IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH CARE COST TARGET- THE OFFICE HAS- THE MANDATE TO SET A STATEWIDE TARGET AN AUTHORITY TO SET SECTOR SPECIFIC AND GEOGRAPHIC TARGETS. THE PROCESS IS THAT'LL BE BASED ON ESTABLISHED ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND THERE IS A ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS WHERE THE ADVISORY BOARD MAKES A RECOMMENDATION. THE DIRECTOR HOLD A PUBLIC MEETING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND DISCUSSION AND THEN IT GETS ADOPTED AT A SUBSEQUENT PUBLIC MEETINGS OF THREE VENUES FOR DISCUSSION. IN TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION- WE'RE GONNA START WITH DATA SUBMISSION FROM PAYERS INCLUDING SELF INSURED PLANS- ON THE OFFICE WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT DATA FROM PROVIDERS IS NEEDED AND JUST AS A NOTE WE- DID NOT WANT TO START OUT WITH COLLECTING DATA. FROM PROVIDERS BEFORE UNDERSTANDING FOR THE GAPS WERE IN THE DATA FROM PAYERS BECAUSE THE DATA SPECIFICATIONS WILL LIKELY CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR AS WE LEARN ABOUT THESE GAPS. THEY WILL BE ADOPTED BY EMERGENCY REGULATIONS HOWEVER THERE WILL BE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC MEETING PRIOR. TO ACCEPTANCE OF- OUR ADOPTION OF THOSE REGULATIONS EACH YEAR THERE WILL BE AN ANNUAL REPORT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PUBLIC MEETING THE OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH ANALYZING REPORTING ON THE DATA IT COLLECTS. PUBLISHING AN ANNUAL REPORT AND HOLDING AND PUBLIC MEETING. ON THE CONTENT INCLUDES COST TRENDS DRIVERS- LOOKING AT KIND OF BALANCED SCORECARD MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF ACCESS QUALITY EQUITY. HIGHLIGHTING BEST PRACTICES ANY IMPACT ON WORK FORCE AS WELL AS ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS AGAIN THIS PROCESS IS DELIBERATELY- OPEN TO THE PUBLIC- WITH AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC IMPORT INPUT. WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT FINALIZED AT A SUBSEQUENT MEETING. IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT THE OVERRIDING PHILOSOPHY IS ONE OF PROGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT SO THE OFFICE STARTS WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- MOVES ON THE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THEN- MAY REQUIRE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN AND IF THOSE FAILED THEN THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR CIVIL PENALTIES AND ESCALATING PENALTIES COMMENSURATE WITH THE- BUT HOW MUCH THE COST TARGET IS MISSED- IN THIS CASE THERE IS A FULL REGULATORY PROCESS TO DEVELOP THAN FOR SPENT PROVISIONS WAS STAKEHOLDER INPUT. INCLUDING A METHODOLOGY TIMELINE IDENTIFICATION OF WARRANTED AN UNWARRANTED FACTORS TO PROCESS THE PEELS I JUST WANT TO FINISH BY HIGHLIGHTING FOR ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE OFFICE- AGAIN I MENTION THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THERE'S A PROVISION TO LOOK AT QUALITY PERFORMANCE- AVOIDING- AS YOU'RE FOCUSING ON COST NEGLECTING COST. QUALITY EQUITY ON THE GOAL HERE IS ONE OF ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION NOT ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE MANDATES BUT REALLY LOOKING TO SEE- WHAT IS A PARTY SET STANDARD MEASURES THAT CAN BE USED. THERE'S ALSO GOAL TO PROMOTE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS OF SHIFTING THE SYSTEM FROM A FEE FOR SERVICE- FOCUS ON UTILIZATION PAYMENT SYSTEM TO ONE THAT REWARDS HIGH QUALITY AND COST EFFICIENT CARE-THIS WILL INVOLVE DEVELOPING STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR A PM CONTRACTING THAT CAN BE ADOPTED. BY PAYERS AND PROVIDERS AND I THINK SOME OF THE SPEAKERS MENTION THEM PORTENTS OF PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS- THOSE WOULD BE KEY AS WELL AS- MODELS OF SHARED SAVINGS OUR POPULATION BASED PAYMENTS. THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF IMPACT AS WE CHANGE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT ON JOBS IN THE WORK FORCE. SO IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF LOWERING STANDARDS ENCOURAGING LAYOFFS- AND SO THE OFFICE WILL HAVE A GOAL OF ENCOURAGING HIGH QUALITY JOBS. AND IMPORTANTLY SUPPORTING TRAINING AND RETRAINING NEEDS BECAUSE WE KNOW AS WE FOCUS ON MAKING THE HEALTH CARE MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE RESPONSIVE ON THERE WILL BE CHANGES AND HOW IT'S DELIVERED AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WORK FORCES TAKING CARE OF AND THAT PROCESS. AND THEN LASTLY THERE IS A- FOCUS ON COST AND MARKET IMPACT REVIEWS- THE INTENT HERE IS TO HAVE A MORE PROACTIVE VIEW INTO THE LANDSCAPE OF HEALTH CARE CONSOLIDATION THERE IS A BROAD SCOPE YOU'LL SEE HORIZONTAL. VERTICAL CROSS INDUSTRY- INCLUSIVE OF ALL SECTORS THERE IS A NOTE OF HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS BEING CALLED THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE READY ARE COVERED BY EXISTING REGULATORY- AGENCIES AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO. DUPLICATE THAT WORK- IN ANY OF FINANCIAL BUT THEN BE REFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL- AND THEN LASTLY IN TERMS OF FINDING A THERE'S A B. C. P. COMING YOUR WAY IN. THANK YOU DOCTOR- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA YOU. WE ARE ALMOST A PART OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE A RESOURCE REQUEST ALONG WITH THIS BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE APRIL TIMELINE BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON- ANY CHANGES TO THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR- AS WELL WITH. US WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THANK YOU MA'AM. BENJOHNSON WITH THE LA- GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE RELEASE OF THE TRAILER BILL WE DON'T HAVE AN ANALYSIS AT THIS TIME BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS LANGUAGE OVER THE COMING WEEKS AND WE'LL SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE- AND THE ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE ON THE TRAILER BILL. THANK THANK YOU SIR I'M SURPRISED THE LA- COULDN'T GET ON IT TODAY I STRUGGLED AS WELL TO GET THROUGH. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. IF I CAN I'LL START WITH COMMENTS AND THEN LOOK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- YOU KNOW I. TOO AM REALLY HAPPY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS WORKING ON THIS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUE- IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US IS THIS AS A STATE TO BEND THE COST CURVE. IN FOR US TO. START AFFECTING AFFORDABILITY WILL ULTIMATELY ALLOW US TO INCREASE ACCESS AND pUNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND SO LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO HELP US TO SET TARGETS AS WELL- REALLY DID WANT TO TALK A LITTLE MORE- ABOUT THE ADVISORY BOARD OF COULD. IT SEEMS AS IF THIS IS YOUR MAIN MECHANISM- IS THE CREATION THIS ADVISORY BOARD. TO ESSENTIALLY BE A COST CONTAINMENT COMMISSION THAT WILL HELP TO COME UP WITH PROPOSALS TARGETS FOR CPAS SIX THURS OR REGIONS AND HOPING YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE COMMISSION SINCE. I DIDN'T GET THROUGH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. YOU'RE NOT A SPEED READER I AM. SO THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED ELEVEN SEVEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO APPOINTED BY THE CENTRAL CAN ROLES AND TO BY THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY- AND IMPORTANTLY. AND WE'VE AND DELINEATED A NUMBER OF CONTENT AREAS WERE- THE GOAL OF THE VISOR BORDERS TO HAVE CONTENT EXPERTS SO- HEALTH CARE ECONOMICS HEALTH CARE DELIVERY HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT FINANCE ADMINISTRATION AND PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES HEALTH PLAN WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY- BOTH HAVE. DEEP CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AND IDEALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND WHO CAN ACTUALLY HELP THE SHAPE. ON THIS THE OTHER PORTION OF HIS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO BE REGARDING ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION AND YOU'VE IDENTIFIED FOR SPECIFIC WAYS AT THE END OF THE AGENDA AND I'M WONDERING IF PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION IS- GOING TO BE BORNE OUT THROUGH THE TELLING PROPOSAL OR IF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY WILL SPECIFICALLY BE WORKING ON THINGS SUCH AS ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITY AND FAILURE OF CARE COORDINATION. YEAH I THINK ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION- IS REQUIRED THROUGHOUT EVERY SINGLE PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM- INCLUDING IN KILLING CERTAINLY THAT IS DISTINCT FROM THIS PROPOSAL- WE REALLY ATTENDED TO IT COMES OF EVERY COMPONENT PIECE OF IT WHETHER IT'S DATA COLLECTION- QUALITY MEASURES- OUR WORK FORCE MEASURES A PM'S WE ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE ADDITIONAL REGULAR. DISTRO BURDENS AND PROVIDERS AND SYSTEMS AND SO THAT'S REALLY- THREADED THROUGHOUT. I'M IN THE ONLY OTHER ASPECT OF THAT  WOULD ADD IS THAT. EARLIER WE HEARD THAT HEALTH CARE IS QUESTION WORKERS AS WELL AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE NOT UNFAIRLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF HEALTH CARE COSTS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AS WE SEE A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR COMPENSATION GOING TOWARDS HEALTHCARE COSTS RATHER THAN TAKE HOME PAY AND THINK IT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE LARGE SHOWING WE HAD HERE TODAY WHO. ARE DOING MANY OF THOSE COMMENTS WITH THAT I WILL LOOK TO THE SUB COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. DR WHAT. YES SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR CHAN FOR THIS- PRESENTATION AND THANK YOU TO THE FOLKS WHO- WERE HERE TESTIFYING EARLIER IN SUPPORT- IN PARTICULAR WOMAN AT THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION- FROM A SE YOU TALKED ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. AND DATA- AND THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY ON THE TOP OF MY LIST PERSONALLY. REFER THE TERM ALL IN HERE- A LOT. AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL I MEAN ALL SECTORS OF THE HEALTH CARE- SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN MY OPINION BEEN LOOKING AT AFFORDABILITY FOR AWHILE NOW AND ACTUALLY HAVE A BILL ON THIS ISSUE- THAT WILL BE WORKING CONCURRENT. WITH OFFICE ON- I NOTED THAT- DAY ONE COMMENT YOU MADE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS WE TALK ABOUT HIGH QUALITY CARE. BUT YOU'VE- AND THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO A NEW. COLLECTIVE PROVIDE DATA AND I THINK THAT- WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTCOMES AND THE QUALIFY QUALITY CARE. THAT PROVIDER DATA BECOMES A- CRITICAL COMPONENT HERE USE ALSO SAD I DON'T WHEN I WAS THE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON PROVIDERS. WHICH I APPRECIATE AS HAVING BEEN A PROVIDER FOR MANY MANY YEARS. SO YOU SAID INITIALLY PROVIDER DAY WON'T. IS NOT. GOING TO BE A PART OF THIS WINDY YOU AT WHAT POINT DO YOU EXPECT OF RECKLESS AND BECAUSE I THINK. AS WE START ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THIS WHICH IS THE- I BELIEVE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. TO THIS IN A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO ARRIVE OUR ABILITY TO RELIEVE. AT HEALTH CARE AND THE- HEALTH CARE. IN OUR GOAL GET EVERYONE COVERED IN THAT THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE AND THAT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL WE- NEED TO DATA. FROM ALSO IN THERE AS WELL SO. JUST LIKE. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU- TWO THOUGHTS ONE IS- THANK YOU FOR LEADERSHIP OF THE HPV BECAUSE ACTUALLY THAT WILL BE CRITICAL FOR THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE OR- HEALTH CARE PAYMENTS. DATABASE SYSTEM I'M SORRY PROGRAM. IS A IS ACTUALLY CRITICAL OF THE WORK OF THIS- OFFICE I THINK FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE COST TARGETS- THEPAIR LEVEL DATA FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING AGAIN LOOKING AT MODELS FROM SOME OF THE EXPERTS THAT YOU BROUGHT IN EARLIER- IS THE NATIONAL CUT TO LOOK AT- EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THE OFFICE SHOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO. COLLECT PROVIDER DATA AS NEEDED ONCE WE DEVELOP- AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE LANDSCAPE IS ACROSS THE STATE WHAT AREAS WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL- GRANULARITY OTHER PEOPLE ARE REALLY- COGNIZANT OF IS THE NEED TO STAND THIS UP QUICKLY AND THE LOGISTICAL AND NOT A LOGICAL CHALLENGES OF BRINGING IN FIGHTER DATA WHAT MUCH MORE VARIABLE FORMAT THAN PAYER DATA ENTRY RECORD PILOT ON THE BACK NOT TO SAY THAT WORK. IN IN THAT WE'RE JUST BEING REALISTIC TERMS WE'RE GONNA BE STEP THEN WANTING TO EARN FROM WHERE ARE SEE WHAT HE'D IT MEANT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE- FOR. WHITER PARTY. I WOULD JUST A PERSONAL PLUG IS LOOK AT I THINK CARE OUTCOMES CRITIC COME HERE IN IN IN THE SYSTEM AND SO IT'S A BECOMES IMPERATIVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE DOING TREATMENT A CERTAIN WAY AND GETTING AND WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES WERE GETTING AND ARE THOSE ARE THOSE THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHICH IS OUT ALSO OF CONCERN IS THAT THAT SAVINGS ULTIMATELY- BE REALIZED BY CONSUMERS AND- AND SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU ENVISION THAT DO YOU HAVE HAS THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONED GOING FORWARD. OF I WILL SAY THIS IS SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING- AND THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME OTHER STATES HAVE- LOOKED AT COST TARGETS BUT DIDN'T HAVE AFFORDABILITY- IN. IN RIGHT IN THE BULL'S EYE AND THEN KIND OF MISS THE MARK THERE- SOME OF THE THOUGHTS WE HAVE ARE. A CREATING A MEASURE OF AFFORDABILITY SO MEASURING-COMPLETELY OUT OF POCKET COSTS IN TERMS OF- OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T GET THE UNINSURED BUT FOR ANYONE WHO. IS INSURED- CONSUMER AM COPAYS COINSURANCE DEDUCTIBLES AND TRACKING THAT IS A MEASURE AS WELL AS GROWTH IN PREMIUMS. AND ACTUALLY TRYING TO. THAT ALSO MEET SOME KIND OF TARGET WOULD BE A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FORD ABILITY COMPONENT IS SQUARELY CENTERED ON CONSUMERS WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT OTHER MECHANISMS OF MECHANISMS LIKE THE AND ALL OUR REBATE. BUT AGAIN WE'RE REALLY LEERY OF GIVING EVERYBODY A TO OUR CHECK WHEN REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO. A MAKE SURE PREMIUM- OVERALL COST OF CARE MORE AFFORDABLE. I'D I'D FOR SMALL AND I'M I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OBVIOUSLY- AND YEAH I THINK WHEN YOU CONSIDER- AND I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT IT HAS HAS BEEN HOVERING AROUND TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION AND THE COST OF. HEALTHCARE SPENDING. OF THE IMPACT ON ON EVERY DAY WORKERS AND THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE HOME A PAYCHECK WHEN ALL THOSE INCOME ALL THOSE RACES SEEM TO BE GOING TO PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE- IT'S COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE AND SO THIS IS- THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT IS- WELL- IF THE TIME IS RIGHT- IT'S BEEN RIGHT FOR AWHILE BUT I'M I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS BUT- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. THE FUTURE THANK YOU QUEST. THANK YOU TO WHAT SIGNAL FOR THERE'S PUBLIC OUR SIDE COMMENTS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE YOU KNOW I WILL I WILL SAY THAT THE LANGUAGE WAS RELEASED EARLIER TODAY AND SO THERE STILL ARE A FEW FINAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN LABOR LABOR AND PROVIDERS THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED THROUGH. BUT WE ARE HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY AT THE REQUEST OF LABOR WHO ASKED US TO HAVE TO HEARINGS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WERE PROPOSAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO THEM AS WELL AS TO THE STATE OUR SECOND HEARING ON THIS ISSUE AND THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE ON MAY FOURTH AND LOOK FORWARD TO INTO DETAILS. REGARDING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON THAT DATE WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN. AND BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER REVERSES HERE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE SIXTEEN. YEAH. SB.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A ONE TIME FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ASKED TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE AND TRANSGENDER HEALTH CARE TRAINING OUR STATE IS HOME TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED RESIDENCY PROGRAMS YET MEDICAL RESIDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA REPORTED THAT ABORTION CARE TRAINING AND TRAINING TO PROVIDE JENNER HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE CERTAIN PROGRAMS OPT OUT DUE TO RELIGIOUS OR MORE PROJECTIONS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS RELATED. FUND THIS LACK OF TRAIN IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR USES A STATE WE'RE COMMITTED TO ALWAYS PROVIDING PATIENTS WITH THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHATEVER REPRODUCTIVE OPTIONS THEY WISH AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING AND SUPPORTING OUR TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE PUTTING PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAVE BEEN STEPPING IN WHERE THEY CAN'T TO FILL IN GAPS IN TRAINING BUT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. THIS MODEST FUNNY SO WOULD FOR THE FIELD IS TRAINING GAP BY PROVIDING PROGRAMS THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE AND EXPLAIN. N. STREET GENDER TRAINING OPTIONS THROUGH ACADEMIC CENTERS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HIDE BUT UP A WITNESS. A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LISA MATSUBARA ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING ALL SEVEN AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA OPERATING OVER A HUNDRED HEALTH CENTERS IN THE STATE- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO MENTION THIS IS A LITTLE FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF FIVE MILLION. TO SUPPORT PHYSICIAN NANCY TRAINING TO PROVIDE FUNDING YOU OFFER TRAINING RELATED TO ABORTION CAME IN CARE THE CIVIC TRANSGENDER PATIENTS. FIRST WE- IN BARRIERS TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN ABORTION CARE- THAT EXIST. PUBLIC FUNDING AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON TEACHING HOSPITALS LIMIT ABORTION TRAINING FOR RESIDENTS. TRAINING MAY BE RESTRICTED TO OBGYN RESIDENTS BEING PHYSICIANS AND OTHER SPECIALTIES SUCH AS FAMILY MEDICINE WITHOUT ACCESS TRAINING. AND OFTEN ABORTION TRAINING PROGRAMS CREATE BURDENS ON THE TRAIN NEED TO DEVELOP A CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. GIVEN THAT ABORTION IS NOT ONLY SAFE BUT COMMON IS TIME FOR A STATE TO LEAD ONCE MORE BY INVESTING IN INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING AND RESIDENCIA GRAMS TO AND ACCESS AND ABILITY AVAILABILITY TO RUSSIAN CARE. THIS PART OF THE PROPOSAL'S BEST TO CALIFORNIA'S WERE TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS.

WHEN SHE CHOSE A RESIDENCY IN BOTH ONLY MEDICINE PSYCHIATRY DR FREDERICK WANTED TO OBTAIN A SKILL SET THAT WOULD PREPARE HER TO SERVE FREQUENTLY MARGINALIZED POPULATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY SHE FOUND THAT THE HEALTH SERVICES FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS WERE NOT INTEGRATED INTO MEDICAL SCHOOL OR RESIDENCY EXPERIENCES. DOCTOR FREDERICK HAD TO SEEK OUT ADDITIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH VOLUNTEER WORK TO GAIN EXPERIENCE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO TRANSGENDER PATIENTS INCLUDING GENDER AFFIRMING SERVICES LIKE HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY. I AM HER AND HAD MORE MONTY IS WORKING TO MAKE TRANSGENDER INCLUSIVE CARE CORE SERVICE SO THAT EVERY SERVICES AFFIRMING FOR ALL PATIENTS. IN ADDITION PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOCATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR TRANSGENDER PATIENTS AND MAKE GENDER FROM HARM THERAPY MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE. THESE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZE AS BEING MEDICALLY NECESSARY AND ARE HEALTH SENATOR MEETING THE INCREASING NEED FOR THESE SERVICES HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL RELATIVELY FEW PROVIDERS WHO RECEIVE TRAINING IN THIS AREA AS PART OF THEIR MEDICAL EDUCATION. IT IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORT MATTER SINCE GONE ACCESS THIS TRAINING. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO THE BILL ABILITY OF QUALITY.

CALIFORNIA FACES A SEVERE AND GROWING SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS WHICH WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT. NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OVER THE NEXT DECADE IT IS PROJECTED THAT CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE A FORTY ONE PERCENT. FEWER PSYCHIATRIST THEN IT WILL NEED DUE TO AN AGING WORKFORCE. THE MAIN REASON THAT PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GROWING. DEMAND IS LIKE A FIVE. TO WITH THEM AFFECTED STRATEGIES INCREASING PSYCHIATRIST IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE EXPANDING THE SIZE OF EXISTING PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND ESTABLISHING NEW PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCYPROGRAMS AS WELL.

IS THERE UC DAVIS UC IRVINE THEIR PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM- FOR THEM TO BE TRAINED IN HOW TO MORE THAN AT HOW DO USE EVIDENCE BASED CRITERIA TO ASSESS PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME AND WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE COME IN. THE SAMANTHA SIZE YOU KNOW THEIR FEELINGS INTO SYMPTOMS A COMMAND AND PEOPLE ARE MORE TRAINED THEY'RE MORE ABLE THAN TO TREAT THEM PROPERLY THROUGH A MEDICATION REGIME BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IT'S VERY HARD TO GET TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. TO OFTENTIMES PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS END UP PROVIDING THAT LEVEL OF CARE AND WE WANTED TO BE AS COMFORTABLE AND AS KNOWLEDGEABLE WITH EVIDENCE BASE. UP AS WE CANCER WITH ME HERE TODAY I HAVE RANDALL HAGAR. AND AS WELL AS DOCTOR. WE CAME IN WHO YOU'VE HEARD FROM PREVIOUSLY THANK YOU I DON'T RECOMMEND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ALSO- THANKS FOR SUPPORT ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND A MAN I REALLY APPRECIATE IT MY NAME IS ROBERT MCCARRON- I I'M A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. AND I'M ALSO PSYCHIATRIST AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE SORT OF IN THE TRENCHES OF VERTICALLY PRIMARY CARE THE TYPICAL PRIMARY CARE VISIT IS ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR A FOLLOW UP VISIT WHICH IS WAY TOO SHORT IN MY OPINION. IT'S HARD TO GET DELIVER CARE DEEPLY ONCE COMPLICATED CARE INVOLVING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY- IT'S CHALLENGING TO SAY THE LEAST I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING LARGELY WITH UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE UNIQUELY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS- FOR MOST OF MY CAREER BOTH IN SACRAMENTO UC DAVIS THAT. GREAT CARE AT UNIVERSITY CALVET PROVIDE SCHOOL MEDICINE APARTMENTS OCCASION ALSO THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION. HER CDC INFORMATION SICIDES HAVE GONE UP ABOUT 30% FOR THE LAST DECADE IN ALL AGE GROUPS HUGE PROBLEM. DEPRESSION NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DISABILITY AMONG ADULTS IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE STATE. HOMELESS POPULATION CONTINUES TO RISE IN ALL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CHRONIC PAIN IS CLOSELY CLOSELY TIED WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY PARTICULAR AND OPIOIDS CURRENTLY THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATHS IN THIS COUNTRY HUGE PROBLEMS. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PSYCHIATRISTS. WOULD BE GREAT IF WE HAD MORE WE NEED A TWENTY YEAR PLAN HAVE MORE PSYCHIATRIST AND I HOPE WE GET THERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RGHT NOW THIS PROJECTED SHORTAGE IS DEFINITELY- ON THE RISE AND FORTUNATELY. OVER 65% OF ALL YOU EVER HEALTH CARE IS NOT DELIVERED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS NOT DELIVERED BY SOCIAL WORKERS OR PSYCHIATRIST DELIVERED BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN A VERY BUSY BUSY SETTING- NOW. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT. ISTHAT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS JUST DIDN'T GET THE TRAINING NOW I'M IN INTERNET STATE THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY TRAINING AFTER MEDICAL SCHOOL. DURING THOSE THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY TRAINING THE AMERICAN BOARD OF INTERNAL MEDICINE MANDATES ZERO MINUTES. ZERO MINUTES. FOR CLINICAL PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING NOW. SHOULD YOU GET SOME LECTURES AND THINGS THAT AFFECT CERTAINLY PROBABLY FOR LECTURES A YEAR- WHICH IS WHICH IS TO WHICH DOESN'T CUT IT AND STATE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. HAVE REQUIREMENT OF TWO WEEKS OF TRAINING. TWO WEEKS OF TRAINING MENTAL HEALTH YEAH THESE ARE FOLKS ON THE FRONT LINE THERE ON THE FRONTLINE. THERE ARE THE FRONTLINE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TRAINING OR THE EXPERIENCE SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION OF THIS I'VE LAID OUT SORT OF A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE PROBLEM WHAT'S THE SOLUTION I THINK. ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION IS TO CALIFORNIA IS TO FIND A WAY TO MEANINGFULLY. IT'S A STANDARD REALLY EXPAND AND OPTIMIZE. MENTAL HEALTH CARE PSYCHIATRIC CARE DELIVERY- SO WE CAN DO THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE HELP OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL OF YOU- BY WAY OF THE TRAIN NEW TRAINERS PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM AGAIN THE IDEA IS TO EXPAND AND OPTIMIZE. THE WORK FORCE THE PSYCHIATRIC WORKFORCE. WE'VE BEEN ABLE. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO INCREASE PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRIC KNOWLEDGE RIGHT QUANTIFIABLE INCREASE- THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. WE'VE ALSO INCREASE THE COMFORT AND SKILL SET LEVEL- FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION. TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS OF COMMON PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS WE DECREASE STIGMA AMONG OUR GRADUATES AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'VE BEEN IN A SITUATION WE'VE BEEN TO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- REALLY. DRAMATICALLY EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED THE WORK FORCE BY TRAINING THESE TRAINERS HOW TO TRAIN OTHER PEOPLE IN THE REGION SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. WITH A GOAL IN MIND OF FURTHER EXPANSION EVIDENCE BASED EXPANSION IN OPPOSITION OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

THE DISTRICT- PRIMARY CARE IS A IS A BIG CHALLENGE- PER WITH PROVIDERS AND THAT MEANS YOU KNOW THAT MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY THEY NEED ESPECIALLY IF A LARGE PORTION WHAT WAS A PORTION DOCTOR MCCARRON YOU SAID HOW MANY PEOPLE. HOW MUCH CARE IS DELIVERED BY PRIMARY CARE OF ABOUT 65% ABOUT SIX OF ALL BE ABLE HEALTHCARE SLIVER BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS YEAH OKAY SO- THAT'S A AND I CAN SEE THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE WHEN WE'RE ALSO LACKING.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOCATE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER THE PERIOD OF FIVE FISCAL YEARS AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING THIRTY TO FIFTY MEDICAL RESIDENTS TO UNDERSERVED AREAS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHERE PHYSICAL MENTAL HEALTH HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST OUT COMES IN THE STATE. THE NEED IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING CAMPFIRE. DIRECTION OF HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. WAS NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICAL STRUCTURES- IS ALSO DEPLETED THE HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE IS ESTIMATED THAT 10215% OF PHYSICIANS LEFT THE AREA AFTER THE FIRE. ADDITIONALLY MANY CURRENTLY PRACTICING PHYSICIANS ARE EXPECTED TO RETIRE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BUTTE GLENN MEDICAL SOCIETY ON THIS ISSUE THEY'VE ACTUALLY FORMED A RESIDENCY TASK FORCE. AND I'VE ALREADY BROUGHT TOGETHER MANY DIFFERENT PARTNERS TO WORK ON THIS INCLUDING UC DAVIS CSU CHICO AND LOW MEDICAL CENTER BUTTE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AND PHYSICIANS FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THE TASK FORCE'S FORMING THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THESE PROPOSED MEDICAL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND HELP RECRUIT RESIDENTS- WHEN THE PROGRAMS OF LUNCHEON WITH ME TODAY ACTUALLY HAVE DOCTOR DAVID ALONSO.

LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS FIND TANGIBLE SOLUTIONS AND PART OF THAT IS LOOKING FOR THIS FUNDING REQUEST AND THAT IS TO SUPPORT NEW RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FUNDING THAT'S BEEN- BROUGHT FORWARD IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL TO HELP EXISTING PROGRAMS EXPAND BUT A CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT BEING A WORLD SO COMMUNITY BEING THAT THERE'S LESS IN THE WAY OF LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS OR UNIVERSITIES WE DON'T HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS. THAT ARE THAT ARE VERY LIMITED UP IN AND THE THING AREA BUT THE WHOLE REGION REALLY NEEDS A MUCH MORE ROBUST- EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AS A PREVIOUS SPEAKER MAY THAT WHEN THE PREDICTOR OF PHYSICIANS PRACTICING AN AREA IS DOING SOME OF THEIR TRAINING IN AN AREA I WOULD NUMBER OF PEOPLE COME TO BE VERY FOR MOST A IN THAT IT YES CAN THIS ONE UP THE STAFF IS NEW PROGRAM EVAN OF.

IS DECLINE. AS WE HAVE SEEN- AND AGING AND THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I KNOW THAT THE COSTS FOR THESE PROGRAMS LIKE- IT IN YOU CHI- IN AND ALSO IN EUREKA- ARE ARE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. AND IF I'M- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY IN HUMBLE COUNTY IT'S A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO KEEP THE PROGRAM GOING. SO I'M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND I'M WONDERING. HOW DO YOU MAKE THIS WORK BECAUSE THIS CAMP THIS CAN'T BE THE WHOLE THIS CAN'T BE THE WHOLE NOT CRIED QUITE FRANKLY. THE IS TO HELP WITH THE STARTING A PROGRAMS AS THE TERM THAT WAS USED GMC NAIVE AREAS. A SOME OF THE EXISTING FUNDING RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE FROM THE TOBACCO TAX INITIATIVE ANOTHER FINDINGS ARE FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS. SO OUR EMPHASIS IS IN. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP GET THESE PROGRAM STARTED IN BROAD TO MORE OF THE REGION RATHER THAN JUST THE HUMBOLDT IN THE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE AN A RATING HAS A SMALL PROGRAM THAT'S- BEEN GOING. WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT ACROSS THE REGION. WITH HOPES THAT ONCE PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING. THEN THEY CAN BE ABLE TO ALSO TAP INTO THE EXISTING FUNDING STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN. THIS FOR CONTINUED SUSTAINABLE FUNCTIONING. IN THE NAMES OF THE DIFFERENT PRESIDENCIES OF LOOKING AT. TYPES AND TALKING ABOUT THIS IS OUR INTENT IS THE NEED IS BROAD. PRIMARY CARE IS THERE PSYCHIATRY IS THERE. BUT THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR THE SPECIALIST ESPECIALLY IN UP IN OUR RURAL AREA I MEAN I CAN SPEAK TO JUST ON FRIDAY I HAD A PATIENT WHO WAS. FRUSTRATED WITH HOW HE'S HAVING TO TRAVEL FROM SHE GO DOWN TOWARD. SACRAMENTO AREA TO GET HIS SPECIALTY CURES FOR UROLOGIST HE COULDN'T. GET INTO SOMEONE LOCALLY SHORE OF ABOUT THREE MONTHS.

PARTY SHOW COMMITTEE TO SEE THAT THEY'RE READY AND THEY WANT TO. START MOVING IN THAT DIRECT. THANK YOU. THANK UP SOME ALMOST THANK YOU MISTER JUST SOME OF THE ON YOU MENTION TRIBAL AND INDIAN HOW IN YOUR PRESENT. SO HOW MUCH THE TWENTY MILLION THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER HE FIVE YEARS WOULD BE ALLOCATED TOWARDS THAT AND WHAT DO YOU ENVISION- WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD GO ON TO HELP THOSE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THERE BEEN PART OF THE COALITION PART OF THE TASK FORCE IN TERMS OF LOOKING FOR RESIDENCY SITES. IT'S STILL A LITTLE BIT UP IN THE YEARS TO. WOULD BE HOSTED BYONE OF THE LOCAL HOSPITALS ANY CHEESE AREAS WITH ROTATIONS WITHIN EACH OF THESE FACILITIES THOSE ARE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE STILL ON GOING TO THE EXACT PROPORTION HOW MUCH WOULD BE A TRIBAL HEALTH HOW MUCH WOULD BE AT THE EXISTING HOSPITAL FACILITIES- BUT THEY'VE BEEN PART OF THIS TASK FORCE SUPPORT DISCUSSION CAN THEY'VE TOLD US. EXPRESS INTEREST THEY'RE READY TO. BE PART OF THIS INTO HOST AND DO SOME OF THE TRAINING AND TEACHING BECAUSE ARE LOOKING FOR IS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IS. SO I'M GLAD ON GOING DIE. IS TO. SO GET MORE CLARITY AS THE PROPOSAL MOVES FOR. YEAH AND THEY AND SO THEY ARE PART OF THE COALITION IS COME TOGETHER- AND CERTAINLY- SO FOR INSTANCE NORTH VALLEY INDIAN HEALTH AND FOR THE RIVER TRAVEL HEALTH OF BEEN CRITICAL PARTNERS IN PROVIDING RURAL HEALTH CARE IN THESE AREAS- HE BUT I THINK BOTH OF THEM OFF UPGRADE FQHCS. CURRENTLY AND SO. IT THEY ARE PART OF THIS. BROADER COALITION AND I WOULD SAY A VERY KEY PART OF THAT COALITION TO HELP ESTABLISH THESE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND AGAIN THIS WOULD. THIS WOULD HELP JUMP START THEM BUT WE'RE STILL WE ARE BRINGING IN PRIVATE WE'RE BRINGING IN ALL THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS TO TRY AND HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM. I MAY HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS IF I CAN I HEARD SOME- COMMENTS REGARDING HOW WE COULD INCENTIVIZE AND SO I JUST. WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT WAS PRESENT WITHIN PROP FIFTY SIX. THAT HELPS COMMUNITIES MUCH LIKE YOURS AND MINE TO BE ABLE TO HELP TO RECRUIT. RESIDENTS TO AREAS- IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE ALSO PASSED IN OUR NATIONAL MAP MEDICAL GRADUATES. A PROGRAM OUT OF UCLA THAT WAS A PILOT THAT WAS CODIFIED THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EXPANDED TO OTHER UC'S. AND MAYBE SOMETHING THAT YOU CONSIDER LOOKING AT A UC DAVIS TO SEE IF WE CAN HELP TO PLACE DOCTORS AN AREA. AND FIND A I WOULD RECOMMEND THE DIRECTION THAT AGAIN DOCTOR WHAT IT'S GOING AND WHICH IS. HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION THERE'S A TEACHING HEALTH CENTER GM ME A MODEL SIMILAR TO THE FQHCS YOU MENTIONED. WHICH ARE FOR NEW SIGHTS NEW AREAS WE CAN HELP TO PLACE REPRESENTS. BUT WANT YOU TO TRY TO COLLABORATE THAT AREA BECAUSE I. THAT'S A GOOD MODEL FOR A LOOK AT. FOR HOW WE TRAIN THE- PEOPLE WHO. WORK IN UNDER SERVED. THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THIRTY OPEN AND THANK YOU FOR PRESENTATION. FROM NOT MISS NEW HAMPSHIRE'S MOTTO IS LIVE FREE OR DIE. IT SURE IS. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THIRTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FORTY. THE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M A FOR YOU TODAY ON ISSUE NOT UNFAMILIAR TO- DOCTOR REGULAR DOCTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE- SEVERAL POLICY COMMITTEES I'VE BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. DRILLING DOWN OR WHATEVER A LOT OF- IN THESE PRESENTATIONS THAT PRECEDED THIS PRESENTATION ON ACCESS TO CARE AND REALLY THE FAILED- EFFORT OF. THE STATE. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE. OF AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE CARE TO EVERYONE WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB OF EXPANDING COVERAGE. THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE'VE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE TIME WE'VE ALL SERVED HERE TOGETHER OVER THE COURSE LAST. FIVE SEVEN YEARS. BUT THE REALITY IS REALLY GOING TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE LIKE DOCTOR RANDALL'S LIKE DOCTOR WOODS AND OTHERS. THERE IS A LACK OF SUPPLY OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. AND WHILE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE WE ALL KNOW THAT AND SO I'M BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH- SEVERAL REQUESTS YOU KNOW- YOUR ADDRESS THIS SUPPLY PHYSICIANS NURSE PRACTITIONERS MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST NURSES- MY CONSTITUENTS ARE STILL FORCED TO. TAKE THAT EMERGENCY ROOM CARE- THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS CHAIR WHICH PAUL SECURITY HAVE PURSUED SEVERAL SHORT SHORT AND LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BUT THIS IS A DIFFICULT SYSTEM PROBLEM. SO MORE MUST BE. TODAY I ASKED WE DOUBLE DOWN THOSE EFFORTS AND PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AS THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION'S FINAL REPORT CLEARLY OUTLINES WE NEED A COMPLEMENT OF INVESTMENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THOSE WORKING IN HEALTHCARE TODAY AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THOSE AND ENCOURAGING THE NEXT GENERATION. MY REQUESTED THEIR CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS. TOGETHER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION WE'RE REQUESTING A NEW ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT TOTALING FORTY NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING. AND PRACTICE OF THE DANCE PRACTICE CONDITIONS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AS ONE OF JUST THREE REGIONS WITH LESS THAN FIFTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN FOR ONE THOUSAND. PEOPLE ADVANCED PRACTICE CAN CONDITIONS ARE PART OF THE SHORT SOLUTION N. P. ISN'T P. A.'S ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN RURAL COMMUNITIES REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF MY COMMUNITY. FOR THIS REASON WE'RE ASKING FOR NEW INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF N. P. TRAINING AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AT UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. ADDITIONALLY I'M CALLING ON THE STATE TO MAKE FIRST TIMEINVESTMENT IN POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS LIKE THOSE THAT EXIST TODAY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. A GOLDEN VALLEY HEALTH CENTER NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE ON BOARD INTO A COHORT MODEL THE GUARANTEES THEY MAXIMIZE OUR SKILLS. IN CARING FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX CARE NEEDS. IN ADDITION I AM PARTNERED WITH C. P. C. A. AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REQUESTING NEW ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS TOTALING SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. TO REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN OR ELIMINATE THE LEVEL THE CRUDE EDUCATIONAL DEBT FOR UNDER REPRESENT PHYSICIANS BEHAVIORS AND OTHER CARE TEAM MEMBERS. THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS BECOME A MAJOR DETERMINING FACTOR THAT PREVENTS MANY LOW INCOME AND UNDER REPRESENTS STUDENTS FROM ENTERING THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. EVEN FOR THOSE THAT TAKE ON THE COST SCHOOL THAT INFLUENCES WHICH HEALTH PROFESSION SUBSPECIALTY AREA TO PURSUE. AND WHERE TO PRACTICE AFTER GRADUATING. WE CANNOT ALLOW RISING COST TO CREATE BARRIERS FOR PURSUING HEALTH CAREERS AND PROFESSIONS IN REGIONS OF GREATEST NEED SUCH AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. RESEARCH SHOWS THE PRIMARY CARE PROFESSIONALS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT ARE MORE LIKELY TO PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. FOR THESE REASONS IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS THE EDUCATIONAL DATA PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS. THESE ITEMS WILL GET MUCH NEEDED TRAINING AND SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND MY CO SPONSORS WERE HERE TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL. AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU SIR. HI THANK YOU SO A MEMBER GRAY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I THINK YOU THE OPTION TO SHARE THIS PROPOSAL MY NAME IS BETH NON ASKING AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED MANY HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HIGH QUALITY CARE SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS IN FACT. AS MISTER. OUTLINES WELL THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPAND INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH WORKFORCE.

NEW FIVE THANK YOU FOR ADVANCE TOWARDS CLINICIAN EDUCATION ENTRY AS WELL NEW DAY FOR DEBT LEAVE FOR PROFESSIONALS ARE. THE FIVE OPPONENTS TO MAKE CONTENT TO PLAY. OUR IS LOOKING TO ADVANCE THIS YEAR. TIME I'LL TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO GO ON DEPTH AROUND THE- MEN'S HERE TODAY. THE NATION'S AND IT'S- FUNDING. CALIFORNIA HOLES. ARE COULD. TO YOU A CARE TEAM A PER. TO GUARANTEE TO. ACCESS TO CARE. WHOLE SENT HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE VALUE OF VANS COULD. IN PARTICULAR NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. AS PART OF THESE TEAMS. THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS TRAINING TO BECOME NURSE PRACTITIONERS THROUGH FINANCIAL SUPPORT. TO UC AND CSU CAMPUS TO EXPAND AND ESTABLISH NURSE PRACTITIONER EDUCATION PROGRAMS COMMITTED TO PRIMARY CARE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. WE REQUEST THIRTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. TWENTY ONE MILLION FOR EXPANSION AND SIXTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION FIRST TABLETS MET BE COMMITTED TO THE SONG BROWN HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THEM TO USE THEIR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUNDING PROCESS EES DISPERSE TO ELIGIBLE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. THIS PROPOSAL IN FACT GOES ONE STEP FURTHER THAN THE COMMISSION SUGGESTING THAT POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITY IS FOR BOTH NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS ALSO BE FUNDED BY THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE SUSTAINABILITY AND GROWTH OF THESE PROGRAMS. POST GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS ARE OPTIONAL RESIDENCY LIKE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY THERE ARE OVER TWENTY HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDING POST GRADUATE TRAINING. WILL SOME PROGRAMS LAUNCHED WITH FEDERAL HER SO FUNDS THERE IS NO I'M GOING FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR THE STATE OR FOR THAT MATTER TO ESTABLISH OR EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS. FOR THIS REASON WE ARE REQUESTING ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION BE IT DEDICATED TO EXPAND NURSE PRACTITIONER AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT FELLOWSHIP WE ALSO BELIEVE THESE FUNDS TO BE COMMITTED TO THE SONG BROWN HEALTH WORKER TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR AGAIN. THERE ARE THEM TO UTILIZE THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTATION AND DISPERSION OF FUNDS. AS ALWAYS TO DEBT REDUCTION I WANT TO GO YOU MOMENTOUS TO WALK THROUGH THE ELEMENT TO THAT PROPOSAL. WITH REGARD TO QUESTION WE'RE ASKING YOU BOLD PLAN THAT AND A BIT ON% THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT OUR STATE HAS REPLACED AB LIST FOR. FORGIVENESS I BELIEVE WE SEE THE LAW. AND FUN OF INITIAL CALL. OF THE COMMISSION. A MERGING CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH LEADERS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WE REQUEST FORTY POINT SIX MILLION TO COVER THE INITIAL COHORT THE TUITION 410% OF ALL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PROFESSIONS. TO ENABLE MORE CALIFORNIANS TO PURSUE DEGREES AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS AND PRACTICE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WE PROPOSE THESE FUNDS BE MINISTERED TO AJ BUT HOUSED HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FUNDER AGE PATH. ADDITIONALLY AFTER CLOSE REVIEW OF CURRENT ASPEN H. BUT THE MINISTERED FUNDS WE BELIEVE IMMEDIATE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO GUARANTEE THAT A FAR HIGHER PERCENT. OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO THESE PROGRAMS ARE RECEIVING FUNDS. COLLECTIVELY THESE PROGRAMS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INVEST IN POSITIONS ADVANCE PURCHASE CLINICIANS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE. REQUESTING TWENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION BE DISTRIBUTED TO AGE PATH FOR- ALLOWING HIGHER PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO BE RECEIVING FUNDS. THESE WOULD BE FOR APPLICANTS TO THE STEVE THOMPSON POSITION CORPS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THE LICENSE OCCASIONAL NURSE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.

DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS SECURITY CONCERNS UNIQUE TO PROVIDING SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE CARE. AND AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE JOB MARKET. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE PROVIDING PATIENT CENTERED HIGH QUALITY INTERESTED CARE WE URGE. THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT PROCREATING A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR A PC LOAN REPAYMENT SPECIFIC TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION TO THE EXISTING. PROGRAM THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM.

TO THE EXPANSION AND INCREASE DIVERSITY OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TRAINING AND PRACTICING IN OUR STATE WELL OUR WORK FOCUSES ON IMPROVING SYSTEMS THAT INTERFACE WITH THE PIPELINE ANY EFFORT TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR DOCTORS CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE COST OF TRAINING. THAT CREATES THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER TO PURSUING PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND HEALTH FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. WE NEED FOLKS TRAINING TO BE IN PRIMARY CARE TEAMS WHO WANT TO GIVE BACK WERE PART OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE AND WHO CAN AFFORD TO SERVE THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. BENJAMIN TRAIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THOSE THAT CAME BEFORE ME IN ADDITION TO THE TESTIMONY HERE I WOULD JUST CAUTION- THAT IF WE TO GET THE MOST BANG FOR THE STATE'S DOLLAR THAT THERE BE A COMMITMENT TO SERVE ANY IT FOR ANY THESE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT THEY SERVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS- AND- OR- BE QUICK ADMINISTRATION OF THE FUNDS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. IT'S VERY VERY VERY NECESSARY- IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE TO SEE IF. THERE'S ANY COMMENTS DR WHAT. COMMENTING ALL DAY HERE BUT- I JUST WANT TO I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER GRAY FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL OBVIOUSLY AND I'VE AS- PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AS WELL. THERE IS A COMMON TO COM LINK THERE WERE A LOT OF US ARE FROM RURAL AREA OR JUST IN GENERAL UNDERSERVED AREAS AND SO. ON THE SENATE MISTER ON THE WAY FORCE CAN. THE NUMBER THAT STICKS IN MY MIND WAS IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE IN TEN YEARS WE NEED SPEND ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER TEN YEARS AND WE'VE ALREADY LAST YEAR THAT SO WE GOTTA GET RATCHETED UP AT SOME POINT. BUT I THINK I THINK YOU I THE CHURCH AT RISK PRACTITIONER THIS IS ASSISTANTS AS WELL BECAUSE- SECRET I HAVE I BELIEVE THAT IF WE IF WE- ARE OF THE ROAD ALL OF OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE HELP WITH OUR PRIMARY CARE. AS WELL AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE ELEGY OF EARLIER IN AND ALSO. OTHER SERVE AREAS AND ATTRACT PEOPLE KEEPING THEM THERE SO I WOULD I WOULD BE THAT WE CAN MAKE IT IN TO HELP KEEP KEEP FOR A LITTLE LONGER. BUT OBVIOUSLY FINE AND AN EDUCATIONAL DATA ARE CRITICAL TO. PEOPLE'S DECISIONS. ON WHAT A PRACTICE. IN ME THAT MADE IT MORE DECISION THIRTY PLUS AGO I THE- CHAIN BUT THE SET BUT BUT THE SEARCH. GENERALLY OVER TIME SO THE NEED IS GREAT ACTUALLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RAMOS HERE HE HE IS ALSO IN A IN A CRITICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA IN THE IN INLAND EMPIRE AS- AS IS THE CENTRAL COAST AS WELL SO- I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND LOOK FORWARD TO. HEARING MORE. WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU TO WOOD ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO. YOU JUST WANTED TO MENTION- IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY- WHEN I AS A TEACHER- THE- STATE OFFERED WHAT THEY CALLED AN HOUR APOLLON. AND SO WE WOULD GET A DISCOUNT OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CALLED IT BUT- FORGET LOAN FORGIVENESS FOR EVERY YEAR THAT WE TAUGHT IN AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. SO THEN THE REQUIREMENT WAS THAT YOU STAYED FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN THE- THE AMOUNT WAS GIVING COULD COMPLETELY BUT IT WAS THE INCREMENTAL BASED ON THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE SERVING IN THAT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY AND KNOW. YOU'VE THOUGHT OF ANY OF THAT I JUST FIGURED I'D- PUT IN MY TWO CENTS IN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE'RE GOING TO. TRY AND KEEP THESE FOLKS- AND WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY OF MAKING SURE THAT- THE INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE IN THEM IS BEING PUT BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AT YOUR- ADVOCATING FOR. THANK THANK YOU. MEMBER AND IF I MAY AT- I DIDN'T HEAR DOCTOR WOULD SAY CENTRAL VALLEY AND- SHORTAGE AREAS AND I THINK IT WOULD. BE REMISS FOR MYSELFAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY KNOCKED TO. REPRESENT THOSE AREAS- I DID WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAD REQUIREMENTS FOR SEEING 30% MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THAT MAY BE SOMETHING YOU WANT TO INCLUDE WITHIN YOUR PROPOSALS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME- STANDARDIZATION AMONGST THOSE PROGRAMS- I WILL SAY THE ONE THAT STUCK OUT. TO ME THE MOST WAS P. A.'S AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS WHO PROVIDE. COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT. OUR FAQ EACH. IN URBAN AND RURAL AND SUBURBAN PARKS ARE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE- WITH THAT YOU HAVE LEFT US WITH SOME WORK TO DO AND- WOULD ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY WORDS TO CLOSE. DOG THAT IF THEY COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMMENTS- AND THE SUPPORT OF THE- PAST SEVEN YEARS- THOSE WAS A CENTRAL VALLEY INCLUDING- THE CHAIRMAN HERE HAVE WORKED. TOWARDS GETTING A MEDICAL SCHOOL PUT INTO- UCSF AND UC MERCED IN A PARTNERSHIP A JOINT- MD PROGRAM BUT MOREOVER BEYOND THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TAKE. KIDS FROM AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY HAVE MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL GET THEM INTO A LOCAL UNIVERSITY A LOCAL MED SCHOOL A LOCAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM AND A LOCAL LAW REPAIR PROGRAM. AND IF WE CAN REPEAT- THAT EFFORT OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO GO TO MAKE IT A HUGE IMPACT BUT- I THINK ALL OF THESE. PROGRAMS WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY FOR INCLUSION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ARE PART OF THAT- HOLISTIC APPROACH. TO IMPROVE ACCESS WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS WERE JUST REALLY LEAVING A TREMENDOUS SWATH OF CALIFORNIA BEHIND- INCLUDING MANY THE DISTRICTS THE FOLKS- SITTING IN FRONT OF ME SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION I HOPE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. IS ITEMS HERE THANK YOU SIR WE HAVE THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUES. OPEN. I'M A POLICE FOR. OUT OF ORDER BUT NOW WE WILL BACK. IN TO ISSUE SICK. EMS AUTHORITY DEPARTMENT AND BUDGET OVER.

WHO IS ELSEWHERE ENGAGED WITH CORONAVIRUS NINETEEN RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. AND THIS IS RICK TRUSSELL OUR CHIEF OF FISCAL ADMINISTRATION AND AS REQUESTED WE WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT IN OUR BUDGET. OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE BY HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE DIVISION TWO POINT FIVE WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING A STATEWIDE SYSTEM WITH THEM SO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL STATE ACTIVITIES CONCERNING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. I AM SET IS A SMALL DEPARTMENT BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT FALL INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES. FIRST PRE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH IS ONE PIECE OF AN EMERGENCY CARE NETWORK THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH WORST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE OVER SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND CERTIFIED EMTS AND NEARLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND LICENSE PARAMEDICS THAT RESPOND TO ABOUT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION NINE ONE ONE CALLS FOR EMERGENCY SERVICE ANNUALLY. WITH FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TEN GROUND AMBULANCES AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN AIR AMBULANCES THEY TAKE IN THE ILL OR INJURED TO ONE OF THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS THAT ALSO MAY BE DESIGNATED SPECIALTY CARE CENTERS LIKE A TRAUMA CENTER. SPECIFICALLY ANSWER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LICENSING OF PARAMEDICS IN DISCIPLINING THOSE LICENSES WHEN NECESSARY AND MAINTAINING THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE. STE TRAINING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR ALL EMS LEVELS INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST STATE. SECOND ONLY WITH MANY OTHER STATE PROGRAMS THE EMS SYSTEM IS A TWO TIER RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES I AM SAID DEVELOPS GUIDELINES AND IMPROVES PLANS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATED BY THIRTY THREE LOCAL EMS AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE.

SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS AND I MAY JUST ASK A RHETORICAL ONE JUST TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST BUT IS THE STATE REALLY PREPARED FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK I CAN ALONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION FROM EMPHASIS PERSPECTIVE WE ARE LEANING FORWARD IN DEALING ALL THAT WE CAN DO. TO INFORM OUR EMS PERSONNEL OF HOW TO WORK WITH THE HIGHLY FRACTIOUS DISEASE AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR PARTNERS. LIKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE IN A TIMELY MATTER AND DISSEMINATED WIDELY WIDELY. I AM REMINDED AND FEEL LIKE A MUST EDITORIALIZE JUST A LITTLE BIT THAT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO TAKE CARE OF AMERICANS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO CURRENTLY ON THAT CRUISE SHIP AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A STATE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTAIN AND TREAT AS MANY AS WE CAN SO- I ADMIRE THAT'S DR DUNCAN IS OUTRIGHT NOW WITH THE CRUISE SHIP IN JUST APPRECIATE THAT HE'S THERE RIGHT NOW. I'M I DO HAVE A QUESTION IF WE CAN- YOU HAD MENTIONED AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAMS BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M SO ALSO HAS HAD IN THE PAST- MOBILE FIELD HOSPITALS AND I'M WONDERING IF. THESE COULD BE ESSENTIAL FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS FIRES OR OTHER TYPES OF EMERGENCIES ARE THOSE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITAL SOMETHING THAT. AM SO USES REGULARLY OR COULD BE USED IN THESE SCENARIOS. SO THE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITAL PROGRAM HAS TRANSFERRED INTO THE MOBILE MEDICAL SHELTER PROGRAM AND WE HAVE STATION TO THESE MOBILE MEDICAL SHELTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE- IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS TO BE USED- AS LOOK THE LOCALS DETERMINE THE NEED- OR WE CAN SAY THAT W HAVE USED THE SHELTERS. IN THAT CONFIGURATION TO- HAVE A RESPONSE LIKE WE DID IN THE CAMP FIRE IN PARADISE WHERE WE USE THEM IN ISOLATION TENSE WE ALSO USE THEM CURRENTLY TO- OUR ENDEAVORS TO HELP THE- AND THE HOMELESSNESS. BY HAVING THEM BE USED AS SUPPORT SERVICES TENSE SO THE TENT STRUCTURES ARE VALUABLE TO US AND WE'RE USING CREATIVE WAYS TO USE THEM AND DEPLOY THEM AT THE LOCAL SITES AS NEEDED. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY OF THESE MOBILE OIL MEDICAL SHELTERS THE STATE CURRENTLY HOUSE AND IS UTILIZING. SO WE STARTED WITH A THREE MOBILE FIELD HOSPITALS WERE CONFIGURED AS A TWO HUNDRED BED LARGE HOSPITALS- WE HAVE ALSO GIVEN ONE TO THE CALIFORNIA- MILITARY DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR USE. AND THEN WE HAVE MADE SIX- INDEPENDENT MODULES OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED BEDS IN SPREAD THOSE OUT THROUGH- CALIFORNIA. FOR USE AS A LOCAL ASSET. I'M JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY IS AN EARTHQUAKE AN EMERGENCY FOR WHICH THESE SHELTERS CAN BE USED THEY CAN BE USED IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS- I FINALLY HAS IS M. SO INVOLVED IN THE ACQUISITION OF COVE IN NINETEEN TESTS FACE MASKS OR OTHER MATERIALS OR EQUIPMENT. AND IF SO CAN YOU PLEASE DESCRIBE. BELIEVE WE'RE. I DON'T THINK THAT WORK DIRECT RECIPIENTS OF BUT WE ARE IN COORDINATION WITH OUR HEALTH CARE PARTNERS AS WELL AS WITH CD PH- WITH THAT AND SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE FORWARD TO ISSUE FIFTEEN BECAUSE I SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN IS HERE AND THEN WE WILL COME BACK TO ISSUE SEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. HAPPY TO JUST DIVE RIGHT IN YES PLEASE MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE BY ALLOCATING FOUR POINT SEVEN BY REQUESTING TO ALLOCATE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TO BE ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE CRISIS THAT OUR STATE IS ENCOUNTERING AND THE SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS STIFLING FOR EXAMPLE THE 8% OF CALIFORNIANS MET THE CRITERIA FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IN THE PAST YEAR OF THOSE ONLY ONE IN TEN RECEIVE TREATMENT. THERE ARE LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND COLISEUM AND DRUG ABUSE COUNSELORS CURRENTLY CERTIFIED IN CALIFORNIA FEWER THAN SEVEN HUNDRED OF THE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PHYSICIANS. HOLD A CALIFORNIA LICENSE MAINTAIN AN ADDICTION SPECIALTY CERTIFICATION. NOW OUR GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN THAT AS- DEDICATED AND HAS DEDICATED FUNDING TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HE HAS INVESTED IN THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE. HOWEVER THE FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROFESSIONALS IS LACKING AND WE ARE REQUESTING THAT ARE SPREAD UTILIZE A SEGMENT OF FUNDS ALREADY ALLOCATED TO ADDRESS THE WORK FOR SHORTAGE. TO SUPPORT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER FIELD IN THREE AREAS ONE TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR VOCATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. TO IMPROVE THE PIPELINE FOR POTENTIAL NEW ENTRANCE BY PROVIDING TRAINING REIMBURSEMENT FEE WAIVERS PROTESTS AND CERTIFICATION. AND THREE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE WIDE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORK FORCE NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKS US. DETERMINE BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND EVALUATE THE STATE'S SYSTEMS FOR REGULATING AND SUPPORTING THIS WORK FORCE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW OR WERE FORCED AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR LEANDER CLARK HARVEY FROM THE LEAD SPONSORING ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS WHO PROVIDE WE'VE COME ON WHEN HIS PROPOSED AS WELL THANK. RETENTION USE A MEMBER. ARAMBULA STEAMED SOMEONE THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT OUT I THINK WE'RE ON LAST EXTRA FOR THE NOW OKAY. I'M UNDER QUICKER EVERY DAY PAUL AND LET OF FOR CD HA AND WE'RE SPONSORED PROPOSED AND WE REPRESENT OVER SEVENTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHICH PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH. AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CO SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS ARE HERE AS WELL TO JOIN ME FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO WE'VE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE- REQUESTING THAT YOU CONSIDER OUR FUNDING REQUEST. TO EXPAND THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE IN OVER TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS HAVE SIGNED IN SUPPORT JUST OVER THE WEEKEND SO IT'S GROWING. WE'VE HEARD MANY STATISTICS TODAY ABOUT THE DISPARITIES IN AVAILABILITY. AND POSITION HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HOWEVER BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA WILL ALSO HAVE A PAUCITY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AND THE RECENT TWENTY TWENTY NATIONAL CONTROL DRUG STRATEGY REPORT INDICATES THAT QUOTE. BUILDING THE ADDICTION TREATMENT WORK FORCE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY TO ADDRESS GAPS AND TREATMENT. AND SO IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN THIS AREA AND EXPLAIN THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DO THIS IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS. I WON'T GO THAT'S BECAUSE THEY YOU CAN. LISTEN UP BUT THE THIRD ONE WOULD HE TALK ABOUT. AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD TALKED EARLIER ABOUT. BEING A PART OF THE FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION AND WHAT THEY DID NOT GET TO DO IS TO IT IN DEPTH EXAMINATION. OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORK FORCE FOR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW FUNDS FOR THAT. WE REQUESTED OFSHE BUT BE THE ADMINISTERING AUTHORITY AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH HOSPITAL IN ANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THIS PROPOSAL MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIFTEEN. BENJAMIN TRIED WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PENNETTA HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT I SUPPOSE- WILL CREATE WORK FORCE THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THANK YOU SIR. P. NELSON WITH THE- CALIFORNIA ADDICTION COMMUNITY THAT RECOVERY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW I DO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD A ONE TIME FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. INVESTMENT LAST YEAR OR FOR ALL SPREAD WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH WITH NO SPECIFIC SET ASIDE FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORK FORCE. I'D I DO HAVE A QUESTION IF I MAY AND I'M TRYING TO FEEL OUT ON THE STATE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HAS TRIED TO GET TO A STATE PEER SUPPORT CERTIFICATION. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD BE THE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORK FORCE AND PEER SUPPORT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT THANK YOU SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PURE SUPPORT WORK FORCING AND- CERTIFIED AND REGISTERED COUNSELORS IS THE COUNSELORS- DO CLINICAL WORK SO THEY WOULD BE DOING THE ACTUAL COUNSELING- CASE MANAGEMENT GROUP COUNSELING EXCEPT FOR THERE ARE TWELVE DOMAINS TWELVE CORE% SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE WHERE IS A PURE WORKER WOULD BE SOMEBODY MORE LIKE A NAVIGATOR SOMEBODY WHO WOULD HELP SOMEBODY MAKE SURE THEY GO TO MEETINGS. TO GIVE THEM YOUR SUPPORT THAT TYPE OF THING SO WE TRY TO REALLY KEEP THOSE TWO THINGS SEPARATE SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T HAVE THE CLINICAL SCRIPTS NECESSARY TO TREAT THE DISEASE THEY CAN BE SUPPORTED HELPFUL PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE WELCOME WITH THEIR MEDICATED STREET GOOD EATING SIX AFTER AND THAT IS THERE SO THEY'RE BOTH VERY IMPORTANT JUST TWO DIFFERENT BANKS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ONLY MEASURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES AND- WE- PROVIDE DOES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES NUMBER THREE HUNDRED SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PROBABLY THE LARGEST. EMPLOYER OF SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELORS IN THE STATE. OF WE ALSO SEE THAT WE SUPPORT- WE HAVE SUPPORTED IN THE PAST AND YOU CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS YEAR. UP YOUR SUPPORT CERTIFICATION FOR SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELORS AND WE SEE THAT IS A- NOT ONLY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN HELPING PEOPLE. I GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND- IN AND NAVIGATE THROUGH SOME OF THE SYSTEMS. BUT IT ALSO IN TERMS OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THE ENTRY LEVEL PLACES THAT. OKAY MOVE INTO IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE- IT IS THE ENTRY LEVEL FOR THEM TO MOVE INTO- AND CONTINUE ON INTO SUBSTANCE USE COUNSELING. THANK YOU MA'AM I'M- FORGIVE ME I DID INTEREST MYSELF FLAYED SHERRY DAILY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM PROTECTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS BEG YOUR PARDON. NO WORRIES- IF I MAY I MAY ASK- LEON READ A FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF REGARDING THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IF WE COULD GET MORE SPECIFICS IN A IN A COST FOR THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUALLY FROM THE THREE ISSUES. NO PROBLEM THANK YOU WITH THAT- ASSEMBLYMEMBER NECESSARY IN ANY CLOSING WORDS. HAPPY TO OBLIGE AND CONTINUE FALL WITH FOLLOW UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. BUDGET OVERVIEW.

HOW CAN YOUR DEPARTMENT MAKE SURE THAT OUR NETWORKS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND AVAILABLE FOR THE PLANS THAT WE HAVE SURE SO MAYBE I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT THAT I MEAN THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE DO IN REGARDS TO NETWORK ADEQUACY IN TIMELY ACCESS AND I THINK WE PROBABLY TALKED QUITE A BIT ABOUT THAT WITH YOU- I THINK WHEN WE COME TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON.

THANK YOU MA'AM. IF I MAY UM C. NO FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND IF I MAY I- WAS HOPING YOU COULD SPEAK TO. THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT IN WHICH WE HAD- GIVEN FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH WORK FORCE PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE SIXTY MILLION TOTAL THAT. THIRTY FIVE FROM GENERAL FUND TWENTY FIVE. FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND FOR THE WET PLAN IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE IN MORE DETAIL- AT FUNDING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. JUST I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SEE JAY HOWARD OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN THAT AREA THANK YOU. I AM SUBJECT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION I'M ACTUALLY WAS DRAFTING A QUICK RESPONSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- SO I'LL START WITH THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO THE PLAN WITH THE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IS- OUR SECTOR THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. I GET MY FIFTIES AND SIXTIES CONFUSED AFTER FIVE O'CLOCK YOU SHOULD TRY IT IN SPANISH AND HAD. SO THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND WAS TO SUPPORT EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE PROGRAMS OR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE A NEXUS WITH MENTAL HEALTH SO WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR WORK FORCE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY LOAN REPAYMENT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS- CROSSOVER. WHERE THEY THEY MADE SUPPORT TRADITIONAL- PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AND ALSO SUPPORT PSYCHIATRISTS AND SO WE WERE. CARVING OUT. PORTIONS OF THAT GENERAL FUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SUPPORT. MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS- THE CURRENT PLAN- RIGHT NOW SINCE WE'RE GOING TO LET THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVE ALSO DRIVE SOME OF THAT ALLOCATION BECAUSE- OF THAT THE NUMBER OF APPLE. ELLIS L'APPLICATION THAT WE RECEIVE YEAR OVER YEAR. FLUCTUATES SO THE PRIMARY PROGRAMS WILL BE USED SUPPORT CLUED THE STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM SO THIS YEAR ONLY BEEN ABLE TO AWARD A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS JUST OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS- TO ELIGIBLE. OLD MAN. PRACTITIONERS IN THE STATE ON A PAYMENT PROGRAM THE STATE ONE OF HIM PROGRAM ALSO HAS A MATCHING COMPONENTS SO YOU KIND OF GET A LITTLE MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. THERE'S A- REQUIREMENTS- OUT OF A ONE ONE. THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS REALLY IN LONER. AWARDS TO KNOWLEDGE ALL. UP MENTAL PRACTITIONERS. STATE LAW. PROGRAM WHERE PLAY TO AWARD APPROXIMATE. SIX MILLION TO REPLACE MENTAL HEALTH MONNING. FOR EVERY. ACTIVE THAT SELL FOR. AND HEALTH WITH COULD BE. WITH DOLLARS IN WE'RE GONNA SEE A LAW GROW IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ABLE TO AWARD- I THINK THAT WITH THOSE FUNDS WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO AWARD. CLOSE TO IF NOT A 100% OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS IN THAT PROGRAM THIS YEAR- TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT SIX AND A HALF OR SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY WILL BE ABLE TO AWARD I'M A PROP UP TO- AND- AND IT GIVE TAKE TO IT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ALL THE APPLICATIONS SCORED YET BUT APPROXIMATELY. UP TO TWENTY FIVE PSYCHIATRISTS THROUGH THE STEVEN THOMPSON LOW PAYMENT% PROGRAM. THAT'S ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS- AND THEN AWARD A FEW PROVIDERS THROUGH OUR ALLIED. HELLO PROFESSIONS REPAYMENTPROGRAM- THAT'LL BE ABOUT SO IN TOTAL THERE'S A ROUGHLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT WILL LIKELY EXPAND THIS YEAR- IN ALL LIKELIHOOD I WOULD EXPECT- HYPOTHESIZE THAT WE MAY SEE A GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS WORD WILL GET HELPS THAT HEY WITH THEIR OR THEIR APPROVING MORE THAN FIVE OR 10% OF ELIGIBLE APPLICATIONS AND SO WE MAY SEE A GROWTH AND THE DEMAND BUT EVEN IF THERE'S NOT THEN IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS SENATE THAT WE SPEND TEN MILLION A YEAR THAT THAT'S SORT OF THE PLAN BUT IF YOU CAN A WAR MORE. ELIGIBLE APPLIQUE NEXT YEAR THAN TEN MILLION THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO IS OF THE PLAN IS TO AWARD AS MANY ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THIS FUNDS- SO THAT'S THAT THE FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THEN THE WORK CURRENTLY CSUS ENGAGING COLDER LANCE. TO COME HOME TO THE PLAN THERE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGHOUT THE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IS FIVE REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- COUNTIES WITH THE X. LA COUNTY THERE OWN READ PARTNERS AND WILL ADMINISTER LOW PAYING SCHOLARSHIP AND PIPELINE AND STATE AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WORKFORCE- WE ANTICIPATE ALLOCATED ROUGHLY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SO 33% MATCH REQUIREMENTS ON TOP OF THAT- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS RUN THE PROGRAM WILL BE ADMINISTERED- AND PLAN ON AND REALLY IN A- GRAHAM PUZZLE THIS SPRING AND HAVE GRANT AWARDS MADE. A FIRST PART OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO. I AND THEN THERE'S AND THEY OF SAID BE OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS SIXTY MILLION FORTY MIN AGO TO THAT. ANOTHER TWENTY MILLION- GO TO WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER TODAY WHICH IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING ON DEVELOPING WHICH IS THE PSYCHIATRIC- EDUCATION CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT'LL SUPPORT PSYCHIATRIC EDUCATION- RESIDENCY SLOTS AS WELL AS PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONER TRAINING POSITIONS OR SLOTS- WE'RE ANTICIPATING TO. AWARD ROUGHLY TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT PROGRAM- AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE STRUCTURING THE AWARDS IS A BIG COMPONENT OF HOW THOSE PLANS WILL BE AWARDED TO PROGRAMS IS ON A- OF COSTUME. BASIS SO WE'RE GONNA A SCORING CRITERIA WILL BE HOW MANY SLOTS CAN GROW ON A PER. CAPITA BASIS SINCE E DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY POSITIONS WILL BE ABLE TO CREATE A WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK ON THAT AND WE THINK IT WE STRUCTURED THE AND SENTENCED TO WAY THAT. IT'LL REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE WHAT WE'RE SIGNAL INTO THE PROGRAMS IS. I AM AT A PROPOSAL IS AT A AT A LOW PER CAPITA COSTS AND THAT'LL HELP YOUR SCORE AND HELP YOUR AWARDS THAT WE CAN REALLY CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO- COUPLE TOGETHER OTHER RESOURCES TO REALLY EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS OR TRAINING. WILL BE EXCITING TO SEE IT IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE GOT THIS WAY GENERALLY AT SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS AWARD FUNDS WHERE THE- WHAT WE MIGHT SAY OH. FOR THREE AND A THOUSAND HE IF YOU KNOW YOU MAKE A PROPOSAL TO GROW BY ONE SLIGHT WILL PAY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WHAT KIND OF FLIPPING IT SOMETIMES LIKE A REVERSE ACTION YOU TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU CAN GROW WITH HOW MUCH MONEY. BUT WE'RE GEARING THE SCORING HEAVILY TOWARDS- LAUREN THAT PER CAPITA COST WE CAN REALLY GROWTHAT NUMBER I CAN MAKE THE BEST USE. THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE A- FOLLOW UP QUESTION IF I CAN WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A PROPOSAL LATER REGARDING ANOTHER ONE TIME FUNDING. AND I'M WONDERING HOW USEFUL IT IS FOR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR. GROWTH OF RESIDENCY SLOTS. IS THERE A NEED FOR. US TO HAVE CONTINUED FUNDING IN THIS AREA AND- DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATED IDEA OF HOW MUCH THAT. FUNDING WOULD BE- OR SHOULD WE- CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR COMING BACK FOR TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. I THINK THAT SOME REALLY COMPLICATED QUESTION ON I THINK OF IT IN THE SCHEMES OF WE HAVE PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCY SLOTS AND PSYCHIATRY RESIDENCY SLOTS AND SPECIALTY SLOTS AS WERE MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO IT'S A IT'S A MORE COMPLICATED QUESTION- YEAH I THINK THAT THAT WHAT WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WAS. IT BE NICE IF WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THIS ON GOING BUT- THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TURN DOWN ONE TIME FUNDS EITHER- AND SO WE'RE AGAIN TRYING TO STRUCTURE OUR- AWARDS. AROUND KNOWING THAT THERE MAY NOT BE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE TRYING TO STRUCTURE THE AWARDS AND THE INCENTIVES SO THAT. THEY CAN PUT TOGETHER A SUSTAINABLE PROPOSAL WITH THE LIMITED AVAILABLE OF THAT WITH WITH WITH THE KNOWN AVAILABLE FUNDS- I WOULD. LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IN THE NEXT ISSUE REGARDING HOW WE ENSURE IT'S EIGHT TWO LOT. AS THEY HAVE SOME. REGARDING SOME OF THE SONG BROWN AND- AS AN ISSUE BUT I DIDN'T. HEAR THAT YOU ALSO DEAL WITH HEALTHCARE DESTRUCTION AND FINANCING AND- YOU BROUGHT UP THE TWENTY TH A- SEISMIC AND- THAT WE HAVE. AND I THINK MY- QUESTION JUST FIRST. GENERAL HOW MUCH OF A NON MANDATE IS THE- SEISMIC BILL THAT WAS PASSED RECENTLY REQUIRING TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE. DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION I WOULD SAY THE AWESOME IT. DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTIMATE THERE IS A STUDY OUT THERE THE RAND STUDY IN WE ASSISTED WITH THAT STUDY A WE CAN INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY THAT ITS CONCLUSIONS OF I SEE PAUL COLEMAN OR DEBBIE DIRECTORS COMING UP HERE YOU MIGHT HAVE MORE TO SAY. GOOD EVENING ALL COMMON OF THE US W. DIRECTOR FOR THE FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE ARCH BUT OUR OFFICES THEY WORK OF PANNING DEVELOPMENT- PART OF THE ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO COST IS THAT IT IS- CONSTANTLY MOVING TARGET- HOSPITALS HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE AB TWENTY ONE NINETY OF PART OF WHAT WAS DRIVING HOSPITALS TO USE THAT- PROGRAM OR THAT EXTENSION WAS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CHANGE THEIR COMPLIANCE. APPROACH METHOD ALSO SOMETIMES WILL START ALSO THEY WANT TO PREVENT THE NOTES CHANGED DECIDE THEY WANTED TO A NEW BUILDING INSTEAD. SO WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THE HOSPITAL SIGNED UP TO. WELL IN THE DOING WE CAN JUST LOOK AT HISTORICALLY WHAT IT HAS COST. TO DO EACH OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPLIANCE. WHICH THAT INFORMATION PROVIDE IN FURTHER STUDY AND I THINK THAT'S HOW THEY AREDERIVED THE NUMBERS THAT THEY CAME UP WITH ANECDOTAL IF I. MAY I. THINK IT'S AWFULLY HARD FOR US TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING AFFORDABILITY AND NOT KNOW. INHERENTLY THE UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT COMES WITH THIS SEISMIC BUILT IN SO I THINK HOSPITALS ARE HAVING DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS NOW STARTING TO PREPARE FOR TWENTY THIRTY AS THESE CONSTRUCTION COSTS CANNOT BE BORE IN A SINGLE YEAR. AND I HAVE CONCERNS COMING FROM A PART OF THE STATE THAT'S NOT A SEISMICALLY. ACTIVE AS THE COASTAL REGIONS THAT- THE HOSPITAL WHERE I TRAINED AT A LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER IS TELLING ME IT'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THEIR HOSPITAL A LOT. I WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE THE DEPARTMENT INTO SOME CONVERSATIONS. AND UNDERSTAND THERE MAY BE MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA BUT- DO FEEL WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO. HELP WITH THIS UNFUNDED MANDATES TO HELP WITH AFFORDABILITY AS WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP ALL COSTS WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD. I WOULD JUST- IF MY MEMORY AND IT MY MEMORIES BEGINS TO- DIMINISH AS WE REACH THE SIX O'CLOCK HOUR BUT MY MEMBER MEMORY WE HAD A HEARING ABOUT THE SEISMIC OF SEISMIC- UPGRADE AT. COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND MY MEMORY OF THAT RAND STUDY IS THAT THE COST ESTIMATES WERE OFF WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. AND I SPECIFICALLY REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT YOUR YOUR HOSPITAL WAS LOOKING AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW HOSPITAL OR A BILLION DOLLARS AS I RECALL TO RETROFIT THE EXISTING HOUSE. AND I BELIEVE IF A FIVE STILL CORRECT MY NUMBERS I COULD BE FLAT ON ALL OF THEM QUITE FRANKLY. BUT THAT HOSPITAL SERVES ABOUT NINETY PERCENT. BUT IT'S MEDICARE MEDICAID- MEDI CAL AND SO HOW DOES A HOSPITAL LIKE THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO. TO DO THE EITHER REBUILD OR OR OR- RETROFIT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE FACE. WELL AND- WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE. EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE- BUT DO THINK SOME QUESTIONS REGARDING HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE. ARE AFFECTED BY DECISIONS HOSPITALS ARE MAKING REGARDING THE SEISMIC CHANGES AS WELL AND SO- JUST. WANT YOU TO KNOW IT'S A HOLISTIC DISCUSSION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DEAL WORKFORCE LAST QUESTION YES SERVICE ON. JUST ONE JUST A QUESTION I WAS AS I'M LOOKING HERE YOU HAVE A YOU HAVE THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION- AND ENCOURAGING DEMOGRAPHIC THEN REPRESENTING GROUPS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE CAREERS IDENTIFYING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF UNMET NEED. ENCOURAGING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND NON PHYSICIAN PRACTITIONERS PROVIDE HEALTHCARE. IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. WHERE DOES THAT WORK ON WONDER THE DO HAVE REAP ABOUT HOW THAT HOW THIS IS GOING- IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING. ON A SAID I AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISS A SOMEWHERE THERE'S A FIRST I'VE SEEN THIS SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THIS WORKS WHERE THE RESORT WHERE YOUR RESOURCES ARE COMING FROM AND WHERE YOUR OUTCOMES. SO THE RESOURCES ARE LARGELY WHAT WE'VE DESCRIBED AROUND THE DIFFERENT LONERGAN PROGRAM SO IT HAS REACHED OUT OKAY FUNDING SOURCES AS WELL AS SOME BROWN AND SO WE HAVE- OUTCOMES REPORTS FOR. BOTH THE WEB PLAN AS WELL AS FOR THE SONG BROWN IS AND WE ALSO PUBLISHED REPORTS ON- THE DEMOGRAPHIC WE'VE THAT PROVIDED A WHAT WAS TO AND WHERE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE PRACTICING SO THAT ENCOURAGEMENT AS FINANCIAL SENATE OKAY I THINK. YES IN THIS IN SOME OF THE ARE FOR PATIENT HAS NUMBER PROGRAMS ARE I LICENSE THE GAMES A SEARCH ON TYPES OF LICENSE. WHAT IS A- MONEY IN WHAT MORE PEOPLE BY THE THERE IS FOUGHT. US THOSE PRO IS DOING ANYA REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE WELL. GREAT THANK. YOU WITH THAT WE WILL ISSUE EIGHT. MOVE TO ISSUE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE AND WELCOME. GILBERT IT'S OUR HEARING AND ABILITY TO SEE YOU. WE HAVE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING JAYCEE COOPER AT ONE OF OUR FIRST HEARINGS. AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE HOUR AND BRING IN YOU AND- I WILL SAY YOU RECEIVED A- AN AWARD FROM A GROUP THAT I'D LIKE TO INSURE THE UNINSURED PROJECT AND- JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE. YOUR LIFETIME WORK. AND LOOK FORWARD TO. HAVING YOU PRESENTS NOW. THEN THE INTRODUCTION WHICH I APPRECIATE- AS YOU KNOW ABOUT A FEW YEARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MEDICAL MANAGE CARE EXPERIENCE AND I'VE ALSO BEEN A PHYSICIAN PRACTICING AND TAKING CARE OF LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ON MAKES A VERY BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN TURNED OVER TO JC COOPER. PROP FIFTY SIX IS PROVIDED REALLY SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AS WELL AS OTHER PROVIDERS THE LIST IS AVAILABLE YOU KNOW IN THE PACKAGE SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE. I FEEL LIKE IT IS REALLY AUGMENTED REIMBURSEMENT AND TRULY KIND OF STABILIZE THE MARKET. SO JC WILL TALK ABOUT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISED AROUND. YOU KNOW SHOWING PROOF OF ADDING BUT WHAT I THINK IT'S REALLY DONE IS REALLY STABILIZED. AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT. THAT YOU KNOW THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS WERE TALKING ABOUT. SOME HEALTH PLANS HAVE DONE SOME INNOVATIVE RECRUITMENT PROCESS SEES TO BRING NEW PROVIDERS IN. BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE ABILITY FOR THOSE PROVIDERS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CARE. AND THAT REALLY ULTIMATELY COMES FROM THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT THEY RECEIVE AN AND PROP FIFTY SIX IS A- PRETTY SIGNIFICANT TO HELP TO THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME ANECDOTES OF ENCOURAGING NEW DOCTORS BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW A FEW AND FAR BETWEEN LIKE BRAND NEW TO COME IN BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENT. BUT AS I SAID I REALLY SEE THE KEY PART OF PROP FIFTY SIX AND REALLY HAVING BEEN ON THE GROUND WITH THAT. AS REALLY JUST. KEEPING THE DOCTORS WE HAVE- AND NEW DOCTORS THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO THE LOAN REPAYMENT OR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT SOME PLAN HAVE DONE. KEEPING THEM GOING AS MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND TO ME THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THE REAL. PIECE OF PROP FIFTY SIX ON THE PHYSICIAN SIDE. AND JC WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER PROVIDER ALL. OVER YOU SEE. THESE NAMES. UP TO PROVIDE SO THE- OVERSEE THE PROP FIFTY SIX- LOW PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR YOUR DENTIST IN POSITIONS AND THAT'S WILL FOCUS ON IT GENERAL OVERVIEW AND- DIG INTO THIS COMMITTEES QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY- SO THE PROGRAM THAT HELPS DEVELOP INCENTIVE FOR PROVIDERS TO. PARTICIPATE IN MEDICARE PROGRAM WE DO SEE. ON THEIR IT IS. A DIRECT CORRELATION INCREASING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES ANYONE WHO JONES IN IN THE REPAYMENT. IS IT SEEMS PROVIDE EITHER A NO ACCESS TO MEDICARE PROGRAM. UP A NEW PROVIDER THE MEDIC PROGRAM. WHICH MUCH WE TARGET HAS. IN WITHIN THE- BY SECOND. THE REST SEE YOUR FELLOW. ON THAT INTENT ON TO IN THE IT WILL HAVE A JUST FOR TEN OF. FIVE YEAR SERVICE COMMITMENT SAME FOR DENNIS IF THEY ARE DOING- A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EXCHANGE DENNIS ALSO HAVE A PRACTICE SUPPORT GRANT. OF UP TO THREE A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH GIVES THEM A TEN YEAR SERVICE OBLIGATION WITH THAT PARTICULAR APPROACH- AWARDEES WILL RECEIVE ONE FIFTH OF THEIR WARD EVERY YEAR UPON REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ACTUAL OBLIGATION. SO WHAT THEY PUT IN THEIR APPLICATION IS THE TESTING TO- WHAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE IN REGARDS TO JUST IN CASE LOW TO MEDI CAL- OR THEIR COMMITMENT ONCE THEY REPORT THAT THEY HAVE MET THAT THEN THEY RECEIVE THE% PAYMENT. UP TO THE FIVE YEARS OF THE OBLIGATION. ON THE DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH PHYSICIANS FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA- TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM DH CS IN PC HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ADVISORY COUNCIL. ON THAT LOOKS AT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA ON THAT LOOKS AT SCORING CRITERIA AND ULTIMATELY GIVES THE FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SO THE SUBCOMMITTEE DID ASK US TO ADDRESS IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THAT FELT LIKE THE OPPOSITION AND LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM WAS RESULTING IN INCREASED PARTICIPATION. IN CO ONE WHICH THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIVE COHORTS CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR THIS PROGRAM DHC HAS AWARDED TWO HUNDRED AND- SEVEN POSITIONS AND FORTY DENNIS BUT A LOT OF REPEAT. PRO ALL IN THE LONG PAYMENT I'M FOR THE FIRST COURT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PRACTICE SUPPORT GRANTS GIVEN. OF IS A SIGNATURE PORTION OF POSITION ARE COMING IN NEW TO THE PROGRAM WHICH WE SAW IS REALLY- AS A GOOD SIGN. THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD POINT OUT IS WE DO HAVE SOME A SUCCESS STORY FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAD A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST WHO APPLIED FOR THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THIS PARTICULAR- INDIVIDUAL WAS AND DID THEIR MEDICAL SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA BUT THE RESIDENCY WAS OUT OF STATE. THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY GOING TO. BE PUTTING THEIR PRACTICE UP IN THE ATLANTA AREA. WHEN HEARING ABOUT THE PROGRAM- THEY DECIDED TO APPLY IN WHEN UPON GRANTED THEY NOW ARE PROVIDER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- PROVIDING SERVICE 294% MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES BY OPENING THEIR PRACTICE THERE. SO THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE IN REGARDS TO THIS PROGRAM. HOWEVER PSYCHIATRIST YES WE DO DEFINITELY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- HOWEVER THIS IS STILL AN EARLY PROGRAM IT IS HARD FOR US TO SIT AND SAY THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS. TO SERVICES- BUT WE DO THINK THAT IT IS VERY PROMISING PROGRAM- THE ONLY THE FIRST CORPS HURT WAS ONLY AWARDED IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND WE DON'T HAVE COMPLIANCE REPORTS YET. THE COMPLIANCE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST COHORT WILL BE DUE TO THE DEPARTMENT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE UPON WHAT THEY COMMITTED TO WHETHER THOSE OBLIGATIONS WERE MET WITH THEM THAT FIRST COHORT. IN THE BE HAPPY TO REPORT TO YOU UPON THE COMPLETION OF COMPLYING WERE. I FOR THE SECOND I WILL BE READY AND FORTY WILL IN. IN MAY OF TWO TWO THE- IS A FOR TO. YOU INTO US THIS PROGRAM OVER CO OR IN IN. TWO YEARS SINCE A WHOLE ALONG TERM CAN. PROVIDE SERVICES MEDICARE BENEFITS. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS QUESTIONS BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN REGARDS TO. THE PROPOSITION SUPPLEMENTAL- PAYMENTS IN REGARDS TO PROP FIFTY SIX. THE PAYMENTS WERE DESIGNED TO INCENTIVIZE AYE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION IN PARTICULAR SERVICES. AS YOU HEARD DOCTOR GILBERT MENTION OF WE DO FEEL LIKE IT HAS STABILIZED. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO MENTION THOUGH IS THERE'S BEEN SUCH A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IN REGARDS ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR BOTH POSITION. AND DENTAL SERVICES WE DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN ACTUALLY CORRELATE BE EXPANSION TO PHYSICIAN SERVICES DIRECTLY TO ONLY PROP FIFTY SIX. FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT HAS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THROUGH THE MEDICAID FINAL ROLE IN PUSHING EXTENSIVELY ON NETWORK ADEQUACY. REQUIRING OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH ADDITIONAL PHYSICIANS. I'M TO PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE WE FELT LIKE THERE WASN'T ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES- THAT IS GOING TO ALSO. IMPACT THE ABILITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS COMING INTO MEDI CAL SO WELL IT CAN'T BE A DIRECT CORRELATION. WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS IT IS VERY COMPLIMENTARY AND ARE MULTIPLE AREAS- PUSHING IN THIS DIRECTION. SIMILAR ON THE DENTAL SIDE- FOR THE DENTAL WE HAVE- DE DENTAL PROP FIFTY SIX- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS BUT WE ALSO HAD THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION. AND PUSHING FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME WHICH WAS FOCUSING ON EVEN OF SERVER. AND AS AS THIS. QUE AND- PUT FOR DE ACCESS TO SERVE. SO THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT MORE. A PRO. THE DEBATE OUR VIEW FOR. ON SAYS TO MEDICAL. OF SERVICE DENTAL SERVE. YOU CAN SAY. ACCESS TO BOTH POSITION AND DENTAL SERVICES ACROSS MEDI CAL WE STILL HAVE WORK TO GO BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE NEXT WE HAVE CJ HOWARD WITH OCEAN. THANK YOU. SO FIRST UP FROM BROUGHT OVERVIEW OF HEALTH WORK FOR PROGRAM AND HEALTH WERE FORCED TO OF WHICH TO ACCESS TO CARE MENTAL K. MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IT SHOULD BE YOU DD CONDUCTS HEALTH CARE WORK FORCE RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF AN UNMET NEED AND IT SHOULD BE DE DE GRANT PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS TO BE SIR TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE CAREERS AND FOR INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED. A PROVIDE A OVERVIEW OF SOME OF OUR MAIN. RAM THE ONE OF COURSE BEING THE SON ROUND TRAIN PROGRAM. SO THE SONG ROWNTREE PROGRAM PROVIDES INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR INSTANCE. THAT EDUCATE AND TRAIN FAMILY MEDICINE AND PRIMARY CARE RESIDENTS FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AND REGISTERED NURSE STUDENTS TO PRACTICE IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OUR MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM OR WHAT PROGRAM AIMS TO DIVERSIFY AN INCREASE THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WORK FORCE TO ME CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS. AS DESCRIBED FOR THAT TWO PRONGED APPROACH OF SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS SUPPORTING SYSTEMS- AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA LUMP TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE MULTIPLE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALL JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF HOW THEIR STRUCTURE AUTHORIZED- FUNDED BUT- WE ALSO HAVE OUR LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS- THAT. AIM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS AND DOESN'T NEED A PRIMARY CARE MENTAL AND DENTAL SHORTAGE AREAS THROUGHOUT. CALIFORNIA THROUGH PAYMENT OF QUALIFIED EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES OR REPAYMENT OF EDUCATIONAL LOANS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND DESIGNATED SHORTAGE AREAS- THE TYPICAL SERVICE RIGHT. COMMITMENTS RANGE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE YEARS- I'D SAY MOST OF THEM ARE TO AND IN MANY CASES THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE YEAR EXTENSIONS AND SUCH SO WE CAN KIND OF DRAG OUT THE- OR- ANY ENHANCE THE RICH% WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS AND WITHIN EACH REGION SO THE THIS. CREATED AS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT SOME THE EFFECT OF FORCED AND OFTEN. SO AS FAR AS I'VE MENTIONED TODAY OFFICE IS LIKE IT'S MORE OF THIS ASSN MEASURE THE IMPACT OF OFFICE FORCE PRO. AND I DON'T TO PAINT WITH TO BE OF A BRUSH HERE BUT I SAY SORT OF CAN'T. THAT IN HIS IS THE STORE WE HAVE A LOT OF THE DATA OUT AWARDED WHOLE. THE DEMO. MY LOCAL I. IN. WE SPENT THE- NECESSARILY GETTING AWAY THAT DO WE DO. THE IMPACT HOW DID WE GET TO IN. ACCESS TO CARE HOW DID WE CHANGE THE LAND. WITH A TELL. THEM THAT'S THAT WERE REALLY TAKE A OF NEW APPROACH TO LOOKING AT SO. WHAT I THINK WOULD BE HEALTH THOUGH. TO IS TO WALK THROUGH A FEW OF A PROGRAM AND- WHAT WE HAVE MEASURED PREVIOUSLY BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MEASURE. COURSE AND THEN ALSO SORT OF PLANS FOR AND- WHAT WE MEASURING. AND IS JUST A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF OUR EFFORTS KNOWING. WE REALLY DO HAVE A IT A NEW LOOK AT WE'RE OF THE IMPACTS PROGRAM HAVE AND STARTING WITH OF COURSE THE- GOALS THOSE PRO. BECAUSE REALLY EASY SAY THAT WE HAVE A- SO. WHY WE JUST GOT RID OF TIPS IS ALSO. WELL MAYBE THERE'S- THERE OTHER THAT MY BE. THE FOR EACH OF THESE FOR. SO WITH THE SONG FOR BROWN. THE STATUTORY DEFINED OF. IS TO INCREASE NUMBER OF AN REPRESENT MINORITY CARE PART. THE TRAIN OLD. PER IN AREAS THAT MANY. AND WE DO THAT. GRANTS TO. TRAINING PROGRAM. THREE YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA CARE WERE. POLICY CAN THAT. MAKES RECOMMEND. ON HOW TO A WAR THESE FUN. COMPLETELY THEIR SCORE IN APPROACH THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY IN THE COMING. YEARS AND NOW START TO HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME DATA AROUND. ARE WE MAKING AN IMPACT ARE THESE FUNDS AN INCENTIVE TO PROGRAMS TO. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES THAT THEY TRAIN AS WELL AS TRAINING PLACE AND IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED- THROUGH A VERY QUICK SO THEY USED TO BE A HISTORICALLY QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND IT'S A VERY QUANTITATIVE APPROACH WHERE THE WE LET THE PROGRAM'S DATA SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN THAT'S THAT DATA THAT DRIVES- OUR AWARDS- AND SO WHAT WE- HOPE TO BE ABLE TO DO IS TO. TO BENCHMARK THAT WE CAN SAY IT. PREVIOUSLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THE PROGRAMS OR APPLYING TO US WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF UNDER REPRESENTED MINORITIES INCREASES WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT TRAINING IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED INCREASES. AND WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT AND DEMONSTRATE THAT NOISE THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO NECESSARILY TRACK BEFORE BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA. I'M SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PLANNING TO LOOK FOR TO DEMONSTRATE OUR IMPACT ON ENSURING THAT WERE CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE ARE PEOPLE BEING TRAINED IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED AND ULTIMATELY. PRACTICING IN THOSE AREAS- CURRENTLY THE WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SOME OR SOME RAM PROGRAMS WE DO KNOW THAT SOME BROWN PROGRAMS. TEND TO BE BASED OFF OF HOW WE AWARD OF THE BILL- APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVE NOT EVERYBODY RECEIVES AN AWARD TO RECEIVE MONEY. WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING GEARED TOWARDS A PROGRAMS THAT SCORE THE BEST AT. THE NUMBER OF YOUR ENDS THAT THEY TRAIN AND REPRESENT A MINORITY SORRY THE FOR THE AFRICAN. AS WELL AS TRAINING IN THOSE AREAS OF UNMET NEED SO WE KNOW THAT WE'RE HAVING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE. BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IF THESE ARE AN INCENTIVE THERE ACTUALLY CHANGING PROGRAM BEHAVIORS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO. MEASURE AND AS AS ONE. ASPECT OF WHAT WE HOPE TO MEASURE IN THE FUTURE- FOR. IT TO THE WAY THE WORK FOR SAID YOU. TRAIN FUNDS. THE MAIL HEALTH SIR. ACT THEIR PRIMARY AIMS TO INCREASE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF A CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORKFORCE IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM- THE- NEW WHAT. PLAN PROVIDES IS IT'S A BEFORE FOR SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND- THAT SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS- AS WELL AS EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRISTS THAT WE TRYING. SO FOR EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MEASURES AND DATA THAT WE HOPE TO GATHER- TO ALTERNATELY MEASURE AND ASSESS. OUR OUR IMPACT- FOR THE SAKE EXPANSION COMPONENT AND PRETTY CLEARLY ONE OF THE OUR OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE THE NUMBER OF NEW SLOTS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IN CALIFORNIA- FOR. THE SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS COMPONENT. THE WORD OR GETTING THROUGHOUT. EFFORT WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO DATA THAT WE DID NOT HAVE IN THE PAST FOR WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO. IDEALLY MEASURE. THE ENTIRE- THE SIZE OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WORKFORCE AND ARE WE HAVING AN IMPACT THAT. INCREASE IN IT. AND ALSO MEASURE RETENTION RATES WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS DO TO OUR- AND IT WAS SORT OF LOOK GLOBALLY BUT THEN I ALSO TRY TO MEASURE MORE. SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PARTICULAR. IF THAT WOULD. BE MAKE AWARDS TO. WE DO KNOW THAT FROM THE PRICE WHAT AND SOME OF OUR OTHER LONGER PRO THAT WITH FOR EXAMPLE PARTY THE PRIOR WHAT WITH SOME HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION WE KNOW THAT THE OLD EASE DID STAY A WE NEED TO DO WORK TO DO MORE ALONG THE RURAL FALL UP THE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE REALLY POTS WHERE A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE MADE A WORDS TO ARE STILL PRACTICING IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM AFTER THEIR- SERVICE COMMITMENT. WITH REGARD TO LET HIM PROGRAM THESE OFF SERVICE BY A- AND A- TOOL AND THEY HAVE IT TOO. IN WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY HIGH PRO COMPLETION RIGHT SO WE'D BE A VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT PREACH THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE AWARDS TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM THEY COMPLETE THEIR SERVICE COMMITMENTS OF BE AT ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS- AND WE ALSO. WE HAVE NATIONAL STUDIES AS WELL AS AN INTERNAL STUDIES IT CAN SUGGEST THAT. UPWARDS OF LIKE OUR STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM OR LIKE OUR STEVEN THOMPSON LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM. REMAIN IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AFTER FOR. AFTER FULFILLING SERVICE. SO WE DO THERE ARE NATIONAL STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PROGRAMS LIKE OURS WORK. SOMETIMES CAN DE THESE PER THESE STUDY CAN BE COST BURDENSOME. BUT ALL THE DATA THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT IMAGE WAS A PARTISAN IN AN- INFORMATION THAT SOME OF THEM. COMPLETE THE SERVICE. AND THEN LEAVE AN AREA ABOUT MEN. THE MOST OF THE BIGGEST WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KIND SO THAT ALL. FOR OF THEM STATE NOW IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN EACH PRO. AND WE TRYING TO MORE WORK AROUND. AND MORE LONG. STUDIES OF THE ORDER. THAT WE'VE MADE AWARDS TO BUT ALL THE DATA THAT WE'VE HAD IN THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE AND ALL THE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THESE PROGRAM ARE EFFECTIVE. BOTH A RETENTION TOOL ALSO. WE HERE AND- FROM PROVIDERS THAT PEOPLE WERE ACCEPTED AT. EMPLOYMENT OFFERS BETTER AND THAT THEY ARE AT LEAST AS NO AT THE B. L. FOR SOME OF THE LONG RIGHT. PRO SO IT IF I CAN TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW. ACCEPTED OFFER HOPE THAT THEY WERE TO BE EL. ULTIMATELY RECEIVE A AWARD BUT WE KNOW THAT IT HAS. A I DON'T WE KNOW THAT IN AND SOMETHING LIKE STATE FUNDED BY PRO. WHERE IT'S- DOLLAR AND I'M NOT LEAVE. FUNDS THE FEEDBACK THAT WE GET FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITIES QUITE PA. THAT WE USE THIS IS SOME. TOOL TO PROVE. TURNS A. GEN ONE. A IN THE PUBLIC NOW OUR STAY IN THE PUBLIC SYSTEM AND STAND THERE IS OF AN UNMET NEED- SO IN CLOSING- WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO USE NEW DATA TO DETERMINE HOW TO MOST THE- ADMIN. PROGRAMS AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO USING OUR RESOURCES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT THAT THEY HAVE ON EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO. GET A ONE MORE QUESTION IF YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER I MEAN IT'S GETTING LATE I DON'T KNOW I DEFINITELY DO ABOUT NUMBER OF NEWS. THAT'S LONG BROWN SO THE NUMBER I'VE NEW. SLOTS AND THAT WE CREATED WITH THE MILLION THINK THAT IT'S AN TO GIVE A CONTEXT OF HUNDRED MILLION FIGURE OF THAT AMOUNT- APPROXIMATELY SOME PORTION OF THE HUNDRED MILLION WAS SET ASIDE FOR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. SOME PORTIONS SET ASIDE ACTUALLY TO AUGMENT THE STATE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM WHICH WE JUST DISCUSSED- END OF THAT A ROUGHLY SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS DEDICATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT EXISTING. RESIDENT PLOTS SO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WAS YOUR MARCH FOR EXPANDING NEW PROGRAMS THE CREATION OF NEW PROGRAMS OR EXPAND EXISTING. GOV IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT PURCHASED SLOT IN THE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDE IT SENT FUND ENTER THE THIS WAS WHEN IS IT THESE PROGRAMS GROW. SO WHAT IS THAT CREATED IT CREATED A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE F. PRIMARY CARE THAT NINE PURSES A FIFTY PRIMARY CARE READ. SLOTS FORTY FIVE THESE. ARE EX. OF EXISTING READ PO. AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF LOTS ARE SO THIS WITH AWARD TO SEVEN. NEW PER CARE AS A TO PRO. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FOR LA BANJO WITH THE LET'S ANALYST'S OFFICE ARE A HAS DONE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THESE ISSUES OR LATER ISSUES THE LAST YEAR'S REGARD PROPER FIFTY SIX WE HAVE KERR DH TO PROVIDE. ON THE AND OF THE PROP TWO SIX THAT LOANER PROGRAM IS LIKE THAT WOULD BE PER AS THE REAL THE FUNDING IS REALLY OFF THE GROUND THIS YEAR I THE BEGINNING OF NEXT BUT SUPPLE BUT PAYMENTS BEEN AND SINCE TWENTY SO EIGHTY. AND WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW THOSE HAVE AND UTILISE AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY PROVIDER ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM AS WELL- REGARDING- THE ARCH BEDS VARIOUS PROGRAMS ROOF WE'VE REALLY STICK OF REPORTS ONE ON MENTAL HEALTHWORKFORCE ONE ON AS AND SEE PROGRAMS ONE ONE PUT. USE OF THE OF JUST TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS WE DID THINK COULD BE TO HELP FUND THE CREATIONS OF NEW RED PROGRAMS- AT IN PLACES WHERE MEDICARE DOESN'T FUND ANY RESIDENCY SLOTS AS MEDICARE COULD- SERVE AS A MORE ONGOING FUND SOURCE FOR SUCH PROGRAMS SO WE WOULD BE INTERRED WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE. THAT DOES LIKE A UP TO USE OF IT TEMP FOR WE DID FOR THAT OVER A THE WORK FORCE PRO I WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE GOOD COMPREHENSIVE VALUE. OF A WHERE THE GREATEST REPORT CHALLENGES IN THIS ARE AND B. WHERE HOW STATE'S PROBE ALL PER IN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING THOSE AND SO WE WOULD OCCUR THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS SORT OF MAKES OF THAT DATA OUT IS AVAILABLE TO THE- SO WE CAN BUY UNDERSTAND THE BILL APPROACH FOR THE LATER TO. THANK YOU ONE OUT PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. WHEN THE WAY WITH WEAPONS THAT ONLINE POVERTY WE SUPPORT THE CA OF THE LOAN WITH PROGRAMS PAYMENTS DOING THE CAL ACCESS AND THINK IF THERE'S A WAY TO YOU MORE SO AFFECT. DESTRY THE LOAN REPAYMENT PRO AT FUNDS I SUCH AS LOWER THE LOWER AMOUNT TO A PRO TO AND- THE NUMBER OF WAR THAT. SHOULD THE WE CAN ABOUT THE ACCESS TO SPECIAL. AND IDENTITY HELP OF IN THAT THERE ARE EIGHT TO COUNTY WITH NO DATA CAP PROVIDER AND SAID COUNTIES WITH ONLY DEDICATE PROVIDER. SO IF THERE A LOT. IS OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER A REACH. APPROACH ENCOURAGE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. KELLY MY BEHALF OF THE- MEDICAL SO WE HAVE. TEACH SIX IS OVER SO OF. IF FUNDING INCLUDING LUBRICANT PROGRAM CMA OTHER STATE ARE. FOR THE PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE PROPERTIES PM FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN TO JULY FIRST TWENTY TWO THREE HOWEVER THERE'S PRESS ON THESE PROGRAM AT THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW- OR THIS REVENUE- WITH THE DECLINE IN PROPERTY SIX TOBACCO TAX REVENUE I'M NOTED IN THE- BACKGROUND. OF THIRTY ONE MILLION A YEAR- DECREASE COMMITMENT TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND ALL THE PROVIDERS FUNDED BY THESE RATE INCREASES. FOR A LONGER TIME PERIOD AND THE ADDITION OF THE INCREASED- ONE HUNDRED MILLION BACK FEEL TO THE PREVIOUS TWO TAXES- AS PROPOSED BY CITY FTA WE ARE CONCERNED ALL OF THESE INCREASED PRESSURES ON PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUE UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE. OF SUPPORTING THE EXISTING PROGRAMS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE CONFIRMED IN THE LAST FEW BUDGET YEARS. ONE WAY TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS IS TO ALLOCATE THE PROPOSED A CIGARETTE TAX TO PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY A PROP FIFTY SIX AS A VOTERS INTENDED.
