00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:02.715
TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:04.417
TWENTY TWO. OUR ANALYSIS FINDS

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.252
THAT THE GOVERNOR DOES LEAVE

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.553
THREE POINT FOUR BILLION AND AN

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.088
ADDRESS OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THE

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.390
BUDGET YEAR SO IN TWENTY TWO

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:12.592
TWENTY THREE. AND ALTHOUGH THIS

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.627
LEVEL OF AN ADDRESS SALAS IS

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.829
RELATIVELY SMALL. THE SALAS

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.497
REALLY CONSIDERED ON A TWO YEAR

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.733
BASIS SO YOU HAVE TO ALSO THINK

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.034
ABOUT IT WITH TWENTY THREE

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.536
TWENTY FOUR. AND IN THAT YEAR WE

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.338
ESTIMATE THE STATE WOULD FACE AN

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.240
ADDITIONAL SAU REQUIREMENTS OF

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:29.375
OVER TWENTY BILLION. WITH ONLY A

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.377
SURPLUS THAT YEAR ESTIMATED AT

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:33.145
ONE POINT SIX BILLION. YOU'D BE

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:34.347
IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE A

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.549
CELL REQUIREMENTS OF OVER TWENTY

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.117
FIVE BILLION IN THAT YEAR AND A

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:41.087
SURPLUS THAT IS FAR TOO SMALL TO

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.989
PAY FOR IT. FINALLY ALTHOUGH IT

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.057
IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.192
WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION WILL

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.760
OCCUR. THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:08:47.827 --> 00:08:50.162
ECONOMIC INDICATORS. THAT WE

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.064
MONITOR THAT HAS HISTORICALLY

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.633
OFFERED SOME WARNING SIGNS THAT

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.835
A RECESSION IS ON THE WAY. AND

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.036
MANY OF THOSE ARE INDICATING A

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.671
HEIGHTENED RISK A RECESSION IN

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:00.806
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT AGAIN

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.242
NOT POSSIBLE THERE'S REALLY NO

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.244
CERTAINTY AND FORECASTING. AND

00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.412
AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.347
FACTORS IN OUR REPORT WE

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.316
RECOMMEND INCREASING THE LEVEL

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.651
OF RESERVES AFTER PARENTS THE

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.819
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION. WE FIND

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.221
THAT THESE ADDITIONAL RESERVES

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.756
WILL HELP THE STATE EITHER

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.257
ADDRESS THOSE FUTURE SELL

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:20.526
REQUIREMENTS. OR WILL HELP AND

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.995
IF THERE IS A BUDGET PROBLEM

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.563
THAT RESULTS FROM A FUTURE

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.732
RECESSION. BEFORE WE TRANSITION

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.967
TO HEAR AN INDIVIDUAL MAY

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:29.135
REVISION PROPOSALS FOR HUMAN

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.537
SERVICES WE WANTED TO JUST MAKE

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.372
ONE FINAL POINT. AND THAT'S THAT

00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.074
ALTHOUGH THE SOUR. REALLY DOES

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.809
PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.177
AND REALLY DOES NEED TO BE AN

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:39.612
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THE

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.747
BUDGET THIS YEAR. WE RECOGNIZE

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.950
THAT YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE SOME

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:44.583
AUGMENTATIONS AS PART OF THE

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.986
BUDGET THAT DO NOT MEET THOSE

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:48.154
REQUIREMENTS. AND IN THESE CASES

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.622
WE REALLY RECOMMEND ASSESSING

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:51.257
WHETHER THE- INTENTIONS MEET

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:53.225
JUST A COUPLE CRITERIA. FIRST

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.393
THEY REALLY SHOULD BE THOSE

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.362
PROPOSALS THAT ARE OF HIGHEST

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.230
PRIORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:09:58.297 --> 00:09:59.632
THEY SHOULD ALSO BE FULLY

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:01.167
DEVELOPED YOU KNOW READY TO GO

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:03.169
READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AND

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.037
THEY SHOULD ADDRESS UNKNOWN

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.639
NEED- AND THE FUNDING SHOULD NOT

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.874
BE MORE THAN WHAT IS REASONABLY

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:12.912
EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO BE SPENT-

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:14.046
IN IN THE BUDGET YEAR. YOU COULD

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:15.548
ALSO CONSIDER PROPOSALS THAT

00:10:15.614 --> 00:10:17.683
HAVE OTHER SECONDARY BENEFITS

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.685
SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO DRIVE

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:21.420
DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING.

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:22.321
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:23.856
CRITERIA WE SUGGEST AS YOU

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.891
CONSIDER AND WEIGH THE MERITS OF

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.526
AUGMENTATION PROPOSALS AND IS.

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.795
NOW CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT. I

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:32.531
THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW OF

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:33.232
OUR INITIAL REACTION TO THE

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.967
GOVERNOR'S. MAYOR VISION AND

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:37.303
LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.404
THE OTHER PROPOSALS TODAY THANK

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.973
YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IF

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:51.684
THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:59.058
IF IT IF THE TWO BIGGEST. AREAS. THAT WORD DEBT UP TO BEING

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.226
SPENT FOR THE STAR RQUIREMENT

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.028
IS TRANSPORTATION AND CLIMATE

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:04.463
CHANGE IS THAT IS FOR THOSE

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.499
AREAS THAT YOU WOULD ALSO

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:08.667
SUGGEST THE REDUCTIONS IN. AND

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:12.872
MORE INTO. WELL AND THEN THE

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.375
CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT- AT THEIR

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.644
OFTEN THAT THE LARGER

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:20.112
AUGMENTATIONS ARE THERE BECAUSE

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.248
THEY ARE ALSO IN THOSE XXL

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:25.084
EXCLUDABLE CATEGORIES THE EXTENT

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:28.020
YOU DO NOT DO A PROPOSAL THAT IS

00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.422
ALREADY YOU KNOW AT A PROPOSAL

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.456
THAT HELPS US MEET THIS HOUR

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:33.359
REQUIREMENT- YOU YOU ASK IT

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.227
REALLY DOESN'T HELP US WITH THE

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:38.798
OVERALL CELL- CONSTRAINT NUMBER

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.668
OKAY. TWO OTHER AREAS OKAY THANK

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:44.503
YOU THANK GOODNESS. THANK YOU

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.473
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- I DID

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.508
HAVE A QUESTION SO WHAT ARE YOUR

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:50.910
RECOMMENDATIONS COURSES ARE

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:53.112
RECOMMENDING CREASING RESERVES-

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.581
MY UNDERSTANDING IS RESERVES

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:58.784
ACTUALLY- STILL COUNT TOWARD THE

00:11:58.851 --> 00:12:01.954
LIMIT. OTHER PLEASE CORRECT ME

00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.155
IF I'M WRONG. SO I GUESS THE

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.024
QUESTION IS THAT- SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:12:05.091 --> 00:12:06.859
IN THE MAY REVISE THE GOVERNOR

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:08.494
IS NOT PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.795
SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH WE

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:11.864
ESTABLISHED- TO GAN BUFFER

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.667
AGAINST RECESSION- WHICH TENDS

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:16.068
TO THIS PORSCHE FACTOR STATE

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.671
SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. SO WE PUT

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:21.807
MORE MONEY ASIDE INTO- THE LET'S

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.976
SAY SAFETY NET RESERVE SO MAKING

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:24.543
A RECOMMENDATION INCREASING

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.546
RESERVES. AND THEN WE END UP

00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.014
SPENDING IS DOWN RECESSION HITS

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:29.682
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT INCREASING

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:34.253
RECESSION RISK AND THEY'LL LET

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.721
WE ALSO INFLATION BY THE WAY

00:12:35.788 --> 00:12:37.256
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. THEN IF

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:39.225
THAT MONEY IS PUT INTO RESERVE

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.759
IT COUNTS STILL COUNTS AGAINST

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:42.795
THE LIMIT AND THEN WE SPEND THAT

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.763
MONEY BECAUSE THERE'S NOW

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.198
INCREASING CASELOAD OR OTHER

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.200
TYPES REASONS IS THAT TELL A

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.768
GALLON AGAINST THE SPENDING

00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.770
LIMITS BUT SINCE WE RE ALLOCATE

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:54.073
RESERVE SO CAN. YOU HELP ME

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.208
CLARIFY- THAT IS IT BETTER TO

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.643
PUT INTO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.845
IS A BETTER TO PRE APPROPRIATE

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.916
IT'S- MEAN. WHAT TO WHICH WE DO

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:04.583
TO BE SURE WE CAN ACTUALLY.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.951
MAINTAIN A LEVEL SERVICE

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:06.652
ESPECIALLY IF CASELOADS

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.687
INCREASE- IS UNFORTUNATELY

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:10.489
USUALLY DO IF THERE'S AN

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:12.324
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN FOR SAFETY NET

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.760
PROGRAMS. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.962
THAT WHAT'S THE BEST STRATEGY

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:19.098
FOR TRYING TO DEAL WITH- GIVEN

00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:20.866
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A GOOD

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.868
BUDGET THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE TO

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:24.670
BUFFER. AGAINST ESSENTIALLY OUR

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:26.872
COUNTER CYCLICAL. SPENDING WHEN

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.841
IT COMES TO HUMAN SERVICES AND

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:30.376
HEALTH LATER WHEN WE HAVE THAT

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:34.380
HEARING LATER BUT WE CERTAINLY

00:13:34.446 --> 00:13:35.581
HERE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:36.348
HUMAN SERVICES. SO YOU'RE

00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.617
CORRECT THAT WHEN YOU PUT THE

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:39.585
MONEY IN THE RESERVES IT WOULD

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:41.287
STILL COUNT TOWARDS- CELLS RIGHT

00:13:41.353 --> 00:13:43.889
SO IT IT'S NOT X. IT'S NOT

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.624
EXCLUDABLE PIECE- WHAT IT REALLY

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:47.560
DOES IT IT IT IT INSURES THAT

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.962
WHEN YOU. HIT THAT ADDITIONAL

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:51.797
SELL PRESSURE NEXT YEAR THAT

00:13:51.864 --> 00:13:53.499
WE'RE PREDICTING THAT YOU HAVE.

00:13:53.566 --> 00:13:55.968
THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO

00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:58.270
POTENTIALLY PAY FOR AND SPEND ON

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.505
THINGS THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE AT

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.707
THAT TIME SO THAT'S REALLY. OF

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.610
THE MECHANICS OF HOW IT WORKS-

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:05.878
SO IT'S NOT THAT PUTTING IT IN

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:08.447
THE RESERVE IS GOING TO COUNT

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:09.648
TOWARDS MEETING A REQUIREMENT AT

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:12.017
ALL. SO JUST TO CLARIFY SO WE

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:15.487
PUT MORE MONEY INTO THE SAFETY

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:17.423
NET RESERVE. AND THEN- LET'S SAY

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:18.657
CASES INCREASE NEXT YEAR LET'S

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:20.693
SAY THERE'S A I DON'T WISH THAT

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:21.594
HAPPENS BUT IF THERE ISN'T

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.096
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN NEXT YEAR THE

00:14:24.163 --> 00:14:24.763
YEAR AFTER. AND NOW WE'RE

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.999
DRAWING DOWN FROM THAT SAFETY

00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:29.134
NET RESERVES. THIS SO IN TERMS

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:33.272
OF THE CELL THE LIMIT DOES IT

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.707
DOES IT BACK GET COUNTED TWICE

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.242
ARE ONLY GET CAO ONCE BECAUSE

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:38.444
AFTER ALL WE'RE THIS IS WE'RE

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.311
NOW QUOTES SPENDING EVEN THOUGH

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.646
WE'RE PUTTING INTO RESERVE

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.014
AGAINST THAT NOW BY PUTTING INTO

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:43.949
SAFETY NET RESERVE WE ACTUALLY

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.818
DRAW DOWN ON THAT. AS THOSE

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:47.786
EXPENDITURES FROM THE DRAWDOWN

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:51.357
ACTUALLY. ALSO COUNT AGAIN OR IS

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:53.359
IT LIKE NO YOU YOU YOU WERE

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.527
COUNTED AGAINST THE LIMIT IN

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.463
THIS YEAR THE FIRST TIME AND SO

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.465
THAT IT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:00.633
THAT WHEN WE ACTUALLY SEE. YOU

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:02.334
KNOW. AND THAT ONE DURING THE

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.336
DOWNTURN. YES NO IT'S A IT'S A

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:05.404
GOOD QUESTION I'M GOING TO

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.206
ACTUALLY TAKE IT BACK THE

VARIOUS PROPOSALS SO I'M GOING

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.830

FOR STABILITY PROPOSAL WHICH IS-

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.735
WOULD COST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.270
FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:57.207

WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.680
ADDRESS WHAT WE HAVE HEARD IS A

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:05.648
BIG AND GROWING AND SORT OF

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:09.686
IMMEDIATE- WORKFORCE. PROBLEM

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.654
AND THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.323
THE PROPOSAL MAY HAVE MERIT THEY

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:14.724
MIGHT HELP WITH THE IMMEDIATE

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.659
PROBLEM OR PERHAPS THEY WOULD

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:17.594
HELP WITH WORKFORCE ISSUES IN

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:19.329
THE FUTURE. BUT THAT IS- SORT OF

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:22.131
UNCLEAR- TO OUR OFFICE UPON

00:58:22.198 --> 00:58:25.368
FIRST- FIRST REVIEW. AND IN

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.971
ADDITION SORT OF GET AWAY OF MY

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.405
COLLEAGUE- IS BELLA'S COMMENTS

00:58:29.472 --> 00:58:31.641
THAT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:33.509
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT THIS

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:36.145
YEAR- THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:39.015
CONSIDER PRIORITIZING- PROPOSALS

00:58:39.082 --> 00:58:41.351
THAT MEET OR EXCEED A HIGH BAR

00:58:41.417 --> 00:58:43.152
SO IN WHAT IN. SORT OF THAT

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:45.655
CONTEXT I WANTED TO RAISE A FEW.

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:49.926
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:50.894
INITIALLY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.895
PROPOSAL. SO FIRST WE KNOW THAT

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:52.929
THERE'S NO ASSOCIATED TRAILER

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.598
BILL SO IT'S HARD IT'S HARD TO.

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:57.834
KNOW HOW THESE PROPOSALS WOULD

00:58:57.901 --> 00:59:01.471
ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED- SO LET

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:03.006
ME START FIRST WITH THE-

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.607
TRAINING COMPONENTS THE TRAINING

00:59:04.674 --> 00:59:07.010
STIPENDS IT'S UNCLEAR- TO US

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.411
WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.079
REALLY AFFECT RETENTION OF

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:12.482
DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WE

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.584
DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THIS IS A

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.953
PROVEN APPROACH TO RETAINING-

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:20.456
STAFF- ON THE INTERNSHIP

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.692
COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL. WE

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:23.960
WOULD NOTE THAT THE INTERNSHIPS

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.762
WOULD BE PAID AT MINIMUM WAGE

00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:28.064
AND THE END RESULT OF THE

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:30.566
INTERNSHIP MIGHT POSSIBLY ONLY

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:32.969
BE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB IN THE

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.571
FIELD AND SO THE QUESTION THIS

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:38.241
RAISES FOR US IS HOW THIS WORD.

00:59:38.308 --> 00:59:39.943
WHILE IT MIGHT HAVE BENEFITS IN

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:43.546
TERMS OF- PROVIDING EXPOSURE TO

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:46.849
PEOPLE OR- TRAINING PERHAPS ON

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.584
ON ENTERING THIS TYPE OF FIELD

00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:49.986
WHAT IT REALLY RESULT IN THE

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:51.554
KIND OF RECRUITMENT AND

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.223
RETENTION THAT'S NEEDED- IN THE

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:56.259
IN THE DDS DIRECT SERVICE

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:58.428
PROVIDER WORKFORCE AND WE DON'T

00:59:58.494 --> 00:59:59.896
KNOW IF THIS IS BEEN-

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:01.297
DEMONSTRATED TO WORK ANYWHERE

01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:05.335
ELSE- WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THIS

01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:06.736
OVER THE COMING WEEKS- AND THEN

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.471
FINALLY ON THE TUITION

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.372
REIMBURSEMENT HE SAID. OF THE

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.340
PROPOSAL WE FEEL THERE ARE NOT

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:12.475
ENOUGH DETAILS PROVIDED- TO MAKE

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:15.278
AN ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL-

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.313
SO AGAIN THINKING OF THE ISSUE

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.848
OF THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:21.084
LIMIT- AND THINKING OF. YOU KNOW

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.720
DOE A PROPOSAL WOULD BE HARD TO

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.422
SPEND THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:30.093
YEAR- AND IT IN LIGHT OF THAT

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:31.794
SORT OF CONSIDERATION WE DON'T

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.163
KNOW IF- IF THE STATE WOULD

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.231
REALLY BE ABLE TO SPEND THE

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.667
FULL. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.602
TUITION FOR INDIVIDUALS IF THEY

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.504
ACTUALLY HAVE TO APPLY. TO

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.973
SCHOOL LIKE HOW THAT TIMING

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.476
WOULD WORK WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT.

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:48.177
CLEAR THINKING OF A SECOND

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.479
CONSIDERATION WITH THE STATE

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.214
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS THE

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.716
PROPOSAL READY TO GO- WE'RE NOT

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:56.352
CLEAR THAT THE WORK REQUIREMENTS

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.788
FOLLOWING SO RIGHT THE PROPOSAL

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.123
SAYS THAT HAS BEEN INDIVIDUAL

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.090
COULD GET THEIR TUITION

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:02.358
REIMBURSED AND THEN THERE WOULD

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:03.926
BE SORT OF A WORK REQUIREMENT

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.528
THAT'S AGREED TO WITH THE- THE

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:08.264
REGIONAL CENTER. I'M WE ARE NOT

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.066

REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE AND IT

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.470
SOUNDS LIKE THAT- WOULD POSSIBLY

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.772
BE DETERMINED ON A REGIONAL

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.640
CENTER BY REGIONAL CENTER BASIS.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:19.108
WE ASSUME THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:20.910
WOULD WANT SOME KIND OF

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:21.778
ASSURANCES THAT THAT THE STATE'S

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.981
DS SYSTEM WE'RE TRULY BENEFIT

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:26.816
FROM. AN INVESTMENT OF THIS SIZE

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:30.186
INTO INDIVIDUALS- ON EDUCATION

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:34.223
EXPENSES. I'M. ONE ANOTHER ISSUE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.558
WITH THIS THE TUITION

CNTERS ARE UNIONIZED WE'RE NOT

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.598
SURE IF THIS WOULD HAVE AN

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:44.467
IMPACT ON THIS PARTICULAR

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.502

THEN I WOULD JUST FINE WE KNOW

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:51.607
THAT THERE'S A FEW SMALL DETAILS

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:52.842
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.477
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO FOR

THE SORT OF DETAILS THAT COULD

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.570
KIND OF HAVE A HAVE A BIG IMPACT
