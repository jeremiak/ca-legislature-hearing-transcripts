OF LABORIOUS HEARINGS AND DELIBERATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS AND STUDY. THE HOPE IS THAT WE COME OUT WITH A BUDGET THAT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT FOR THE LONG TERM. THAT IS OUR GOAL AND AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND WE'VE STILL GOT SOME WORK AT AHEAD OF US. THAT WE DO SENATOR AND LET'S BEGIN BY HAVING THE ROOM A QUORUM ESTABLISH WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MITCHELL. SEND YOUR WELL -- ALSO. WE'RE TAUGHT OF JONES. LEYVA. MCGUIRE. MONNING YEAR MORE LOCK MORRELL [inaudible] PAN [inaudible] ROTH [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN [inaudible] STONE. NUMBER. WHY BECAUSE HE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A QUORUM HAS BEEN NOTED. MR THIS ONE OFTEN. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED COLLEAGUES WITH OF THE FIRST ITEM MARKED ON OUR AGENDA AB. SEVENTY SIX EDUCATION FINANCE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. TO FOR THIS FIRST BILL AB SEVENTY SIX AND I'LL CLARIFY THE START THAT IN EACH OF THESE TRAILER BILLS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DETAILS SOME OF THEM ARE VERY LONG. SO FOR EACH OF THEM ALL MENTION TWO OR THREE OF WHAT WE FINANCE CONSIDER SOME THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS OF IT AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE ITEMS I THINK THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. SO IN THIS BILL -- THREE THE KEY PROVISIONS THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR FIRST APPROPRIATING SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SAID ABOUT FUNDING THIS IS FUNDING OWED UNDER PROPOSITION I HIGHER FISCAL YEARS SO THAT'S MONEY THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. A SECOND HIGHLIGHT OF THIS BILL IS A CHANGE TO THE PROPOSITION NINETY CERTIFICATION PROCESS. REQUIRING THAT THERE BE NO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO PROPER TO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR FOR PRIOR YEARS IT CAN GO UP OR IF WE DO OWE MORE MONEY TO SCHOOLS BUT AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. CANNOT GO DOWN AND IT ALSO ELIMINATES THAT COT ALLOCATION SCHEDULE THAT WAS CREATED IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET ACT THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD USE ACCESS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT APPROPRIATIONS FOR SATELLITE PAYMENTS IN. FUTURE BUDGETS. AND THEN THE THIRD ITEM THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THIS BILL IS AN ADJUSTMENT IN THAT COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT COLA FOR THE LCS FAST -- WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED UNDER LAW -- BUT WHEN COAL -- FOR LCF EXCEEDS THE OVERALL GROWTH IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THERE WOULD BE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THAT CALL LEVEL UNDER THIS BILL SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS MR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST. WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ELABORATION AS TO THE PROHIBITION OF OF NO DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT IN THE FUTURE WE KIND OF INCOME BRING [inaudible] FUTURE. PLAYED. LAKE JURORS -- IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT WOULD THAT HAVE ON THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IN THE GENERAL FUND WERE PAYING? FOR SCHOOL BOND PAYMENTS. SO IT WOULD PROBABLY PUT AN EVER MORE STRESS I WOULD THINK ON THE GENERAL FUND SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC. SO I'LL MAKE A COUPLE POINTS IN AND JUST GIVE MY TEAM CAN ELABORATE AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST THING IN TERMS OF GENERAL ENCUMBRANCE ON FUTURE. LEGISLATURE'S ALL OF THIS IS IN STATUTES SO -- SO ANYTHING -- FUTURE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE ANY ACTION ON ANY OF THE ITEMS IN THIS BILL OR IN CURRENT LAW. IN THE PAST YES -- AND SO AND SO THAT'S THE FIRST BROADER POINT -- I THINK SECOND -- WELL -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION REALIZES FOR SCHOOLS IT CAN BE VERY TOUGH WHEN THEY'VE GONE THROUGH A FISCAL YEAR THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE MONEY THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT AND THEN AFTER THAT YEAR IS OVER -- IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SPEND LESS THAN THAT AND AND THAT CHANGES WHAT THEY GET IN FUTURE YEARS EVEN THOUGH THAT IS THE GUARANTEE WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE IN FUTURE YEARS. SO WE SEE THIS AS GIVING SCHOOLS MUCH MORE PREDICTABILITY -- THAT WE SHOULD HAVE UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WE ALL KNOW IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FORMULA BUT ONCE THE FISCAL YEAR IS OVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF THAT SHOULD BE WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO AND THEN THE LAST THING IN TERMS OF FISCAL PRESSURE THAT YOU MENTION SENATOR MORE LOCK -- THE LAST CHANGE THAT I MENTIONED IN TERMS OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COAL LOT. THAT'S DESIGNED TO ADDRESS IN MANY WAYS THE CONCERN THAT YOU RAISED IN THAT WHAT IF YOU HAVE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT'S GROWING AT A LEVEL THAT'S MAYBE LESS THAN WE ANTICIPATED. AND YET THE COLA THAT WE HAVE IN STATUTE WHICH IS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IS MUCH HIGHER. THAN WE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OR EIGHT MY CROWD OUT YOU KNOW THE LCS OUT FUNDING MY CRIED OUT OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE GUARANTEE AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS IN CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN BUDGET COMMITTEE WHETHER IT'S SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. OR AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING OR OTHER PROGRAMS SO THIS CHANGE IT REDUCES THAT PRESSURE BY ALIGNING THE COLA WITH GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE IF THE GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEES LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE VERY WELCOME SIR TO NIELSEN. YOU. TO SPECULATE ON THE IMPACT ON DECLINING BOTH DISTRICTS OF THIS. THIS ISSUE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED BUT MAYBE NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A NO VOTE ON IT BUT IT DOES CONCERN ME THE I DON'T KNOW I WANNA SEE TAMPERING BUT THE TWEAKING OF FOR THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FORMULA. ONE LET BE. TO SCHOOLS WHOSE. THANK ENROLLMENT. SO I'LL MAKE ONE POINT AND THEN A JESSICA CAN ELABORATE I THINK THE MAIN THING HERE IS THAT. BY OFFERING GREATER PREDICTABILITY AND CERTAINTY FOR PRIOR YEAR APPROPRIATIONS. GIVE THOSE SCHOOLS MORE STABILITY US TODAY AT THE TIME IF THEIR ENROLLMENTS ARE DECLINING. THEY'RE NOT ALREADY ALLOW ALREADY TO DEALING WITH THAT THEY'RE NOT ALSO DEALING WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GUARANTEE. AND THE OVERALL POINT THOUGH IS THAT WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT -- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO SCHOOLS GENERALLY BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF SCHOOLS ARE MANAGING AND JESSICA. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE IS I'M SORRY JUST COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NEED A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST THAT WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE NOT ALL OF THE TESTS. ON THE THE TEST ONE TEST TO TEST THREE THATWE FIND THAT ARE ADA DRIVEN SO CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE ARE IN A DECLINING ENROLLMENT ENVIRONMENT WE ARE IN A TEST. ONE AND THAT ENSURES THAT EVEN IF. THE ADA DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WE'RE STILL RECEIVING THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% -- OF THE STATE BUDGET THAT WAS GUARANTEED WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ON THAT DATES BACK -- TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN AND SO THAT'S THAT IS ONE LEVEL OF PROTECTION I WOULD ALSO JUST REMIND FOLKS THAT -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE LCF APPORTION IT WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE -- THERE IS A A HOLD HARMLESS ESSENTIALLY SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN USE THE EIGHTY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR IF IT WAS HIGHER TO MAINTAIN FUNDING -- IN THEIR CURRENT YEAR SO THERE ARE SOME MECHANISMS IN THERE TO PROTECT THOSE SCHOOLS -- FROM FUNDING DECLINES THANKS FOR REMINDING ME THAT LOCAL. CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA PROVISION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS. SEE NONLOCAL UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND AND THE STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK DAY DONE W APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'D HAVE AN EIGHTY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE.

A SECOND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- AGREEING ON AN APPROACH WHERE WE DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS BY MORE THAN 50% -- SO THEY WOULD GO FROM A LITTLE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CAL GRANTS TO FORTY ONE THOUSAND AWARDS -- FOR THESE COMPETITIVE AWARDS AND WE WOULD ALSO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT STUDENTS UNDER AB FIVE FORTY UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE COMPETITIVE AWARDS -- THE THIRD HIGHLIGHT IS THE ADDITION OF A SECOND YEAR US FREE QUICK COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS -- AND AS WELL AS SOME -- CLARIFICATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FINALLY -- THE CREATION OF A CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT GRANT PROGRAM A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] YEAH YEAH [inaudible] WHATEVER.

BUT IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO WARRANT A NO VOTE. BUT DID. IT'S OF SOME CONCERN. AND IF IT THE LITTLE BIT OF TAMPERING WITH THE CAL WORKS WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY THE GAIN PROGRAM -- RICK RELATED TO THE THE DAY SINGLE SAFETY NET RESERVE PROGRAM. AND THE WORKING REQUIREMENTS. AGAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FATAL FLAW TO THE BILL. BUT JUST TO POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. THANK YOU IN AND JUST TO CLARIFY AS WE WERE ABLE TO CLEAR FIVE SAID THE NIGHT AT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THE ACTION WITH REGARD TO THE SALARY DOESN'T APPLY TO THE CITY IN THE PRESIDENT.

WORKING CLASS CONCEDE THEIR STI DEDUCTIONS COMING OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECK AFTER THAT RESERVE IS EXHAUSTED.

OVER CONTROLLING AGENCIES. WE'RE A CALL [inaudible] HERE. TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. MORE ABILITY TO CERTIFY. COLLECTION OF CATION FEES AND IT'S BEYOND THE CONTROL THE LEGISLATURE'S EVERY YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE'S DOING MORE OF THAT GIVING AS EXCEEDING THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATORS AND THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT TO THE AGENCIES TO MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATIONS. OF THE APPLICATION OF FEES.

ITEM ELEVEN AB NINE FIVE NEW JUDGESHIPS AT A COST OF THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND AS WE ALL DISCUSSED OR AS MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE DISCUSSED AT THE SHOULD BE ALLOCATED THROUGH A NEEDS ASSESSMENT FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND SECOND THIS INCREASES THE TRIAL COURT RESERVE CAP FROM 1% SENATOR ROBB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NOT SO MUCH A QUESTION BUT TO A CONCERN AND I MENTIONED THIS IN THIS FORUM. ON OTHER OCCASIONS BEFORE AND MY CONCERN IS OVER. REPORTS UNCONFIRMED OF COURSE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL INTENDS TO SEPARATE OUT THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPECIFIC JUDGE. POSITIONS FROM THE FUNDING. THAT FOLLOWS NATURALLY FOR COURT ROOM SUPPORT PERSONNEL AND REALLOCATE THE COURT ROOM PERSONNEL FUNDING. IN A MANNER DIFFERENTLY THAN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WOULD CALL FOR THE TRIAL JUDGE POSITIONS TO BE ALLOCATED. IF TRUE THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE FOR HAVING NEW JUDGESHIPS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE A JUDGE IN A COURT ROOM. WITHOUT THE STAFF NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE COR ROOM. I HAVE ATTEMPTED. TO GET SOME CONFIRMATION OF EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AS TO THE ACCURACY OF THOSE REPORTS -- AN AS YET ALTHOUGH I'VE MENTIONED IT IN THIS FORUM BEFORE NO REAL INFORMATION IS BEEN FORTHCOMING FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I ASSUME THEY LISTEN TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SO I'M OBVIOUSLY GOING TO VOTE. FOR THIS TODAY BUT BEING THE PERSON WHO WAS CARRIED A JUDGE BILL IN VIRTUALLY EVERY YEAR OF THE NOW GOING ON SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN UP HERE. I WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF THOSE REPORTS HAPPEN TO BE TRUE AND I WOULD CERTAINLY HATE TO HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. ON THE FLOOR OF THIS HOUSE WHEN IT COMES UP VERY VERY SOON SO. TO THOSE OF YOU LISTENING OUT THERE I WOULD APPRECIATE A PHONE CALL TO LET ME KNOW THAT IN FACT THOSE REPORTS ARE SIMPLY INACCURATE. AND THAT THE SUPPORT PERSONNEL FUNDING WILL FOLLOW THE TRIAL JUDGE FUNDING TO THE COURTS AS DETERMINED. BY THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT NO CRITICISM. I APPRECIATE THE JUDGES THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND. SURE AARON OUTDOORS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- HOPEFULLY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REACH OUT TO AND PROVIDE. MORE CLARITY BOOK BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ALLOCATION. METHOD ALL. THIS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE DIFFERENT COURTS AROUND THE STATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HE NUMBER OF JUDGES. AND SO THEREFORE -- WHEN THEY THE COURTS THAT RECEIVE MORE JUDGES HI GET THOSE JUDGES THE ALL ON THE NATURAL BE PROVIDED WITH MORE RESOURCES WHEN THE COURT USES THEIR -- THAT SYSTEM METHODOLOGY TO DISTRIBUTE OUR SUPPORT STAFF WELL I CERTAINLY HOPE THEY DO REACH OUT OF THE REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE'S A MEMORANDUM FLOATING. AMONG THE JUDGES. THAT DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DRILL DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY TO FIND OUT THE ANSWER TO THIS BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AROUND FOR YOUR HELP ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

B. NINETY SIX EMERGENCY TELEPHONE USERS SURCHARGE JACK FINANCE. SO THIS BILL -- IMPLEMENTS THE PROPOSAL OUT THAT WAS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING -- SINCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY REGARDING THAT DECLINING BALANCE AND SATIN AND STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT -- THIS -- IS NECESSARY FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WHICH WE KNOW IS OUTDATED AND THAT'S COME UNDER STRESS SO THIS IS INVOLVED IN CREATING REDUNDANCIES IN THE SYSTEM MAKING SURE THAT THERE AREN'T OUTAGES AND MAKING SURE THAT CALLS. CAN BE RE DIRECTED WHEN A SPECIFIC NINE ONE ONE DISPATCH CENTER CAN NO LONGER BE REACHED -- SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES THE REASON THE FUNDING AND THAT -- ACCOUNT HAS GONE DOWN IS BECAUSE WE HAVE CHARGED A FEE ON INTERSTATE VOICE CALLS AND AS PEOPLE SHIFT FROM VOICE CALLS TO TEXTING AND OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. THE FEE REVENUE HAS DECLINED SO INSTEAD WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATES A FLAT PER ACT. SAYS FIND FEE WAS A FEE ON MOBILE -- TRANSACT -- PREPAID MOBILE TRANSACTIONS -- TO REPLENISH THE ACCOUNT AND THE LINE OUR SYSTEM WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER STATES IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL THE NEW FLAT RATE FEE WOULD BE BETWEEN ZERO AND EIGHTY CENTS -- WERE AT ESTIMATING CURRENTLY THAT AND AT NEXT MONTH'S IT'S IMPLEMENTED NEXT YEAR WILL BE AROUND THIRTY FOUR CENTS ALTHOUGH THAT IS SUBJECT TO SOME FLUCTUATION IN -- YES WOULD MAKE THE DETERMINATION BASED SPECIFICALLY ON THE PARAMETERS AND THIS TRAILER BILL SO THOSE ARE THE KEY OUTLINES AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS SENATOR. MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER NO QUESTIONS BUT A BRIEF COMMENT. A BRIEF ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH. LOOK. THIS IS GONNA BE THE SECOND TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE POTENTIALLY SEE SINCE ISSUE. AND BEING HONEST ABOUT IT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE ALL SET ASIDE OUR POLITICS -- AND FINALLY GET THIS FEE PASSED -- THERE ARE SOME OF THE CHAMBERS THAT WILL SAY THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE MOVE FOR THE ONE TIME TIMES WE GOT SIXTY MILLION THE BUDGET TO KEEP THE FUND HOLE AT THIS POINT -- AND THERE'S NO OTHER STATE IN THIS UNION. THAT FINDS AND NINE ONE ONE UPGRADE WITH ONE TIME FUNDS. IT'S ALL CHARGED BE A SURCHARGE. AND I REALLY BELIEVE. I THINK MANY OF US TO BEEN IMPACTED BY FIRES BELIEVE THAT IT'S TIME THAT WE PUT THE POLITICS ASIDE AND FIND THE UPGRADE THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. THAT WE'VE KNOWN THIS IS COMMON FOR GREATER PART OF A DECADE IN JUST WANTED TO BE A CIVIC CENTER THIS IS GONNA BE DISCUSSION -- TO BE DETERMINED HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE START HAVING THAT CONVERSATION NOW ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I APPRECIATE USE AND REQUIRING COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE. THIRTY NIELSEN. WELL I WILL REITERATE MY COLLEAGUE DID THAT THIS IS BEEN AROUND A LONG. AND IT'S BEEN. THE FRUSTRATING AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS BEEN PURSUIT. AND I THINK IN NO SMALL MEASURE BY THE MANNER WHICH HAVE BEEN PURSUED HAS BEEN REJECTED. UNTIL NOW. AND NOW I AM CONCERNED. THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT TO IT'S PRETTY TOUGH FOR ME TO SAY NO. BUT I THINK THAT THIS A LITTLE BIT AGREED HERE. WHEN THIS IS ALLOWING AN AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT? TO CYCLE UP TO IS MUCH IS EIGHTY CENTS. RAISING THE NINE ONE ONE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT A FATE. I EXPECTED A LITTLE QUICKLY STARTED EIGHTY IT WON'T END TODAY. AND I DON'T REALLY LIKE GIVING. AUTHORITIES THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY. I LOVE THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY WORK VERY WELL WITH THIS THIS YEAR. BUT THIS ONE IS KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF A DECEPTIVE THING I THINK TO THE CITIZENS. WHEN THEY GET A TO GET THEIR BILLS? MAYBE THEY'LL REALIZE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT.

SO THIS TRAILER BILL -- IT TAKES A NUMBER STEPS CANNABIS I'LL JUST MENTION THREE AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FIRST IT STRENGTHENING THE EQUITY BY A GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAW LAST YEAR. FIVE WHICH TAKES A NUMBER OF STEPS BUT ONE OF THEM IS AUTHORIZING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON BEHALF OF THE BEER OF CABINET CANNABIS CONTROL TO ADMINISTER PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE PROGRAMS FOR THE REVIEW AND GRANTING A FUNDING FOR CANNABISEQUITY PROGRAMS. A SECOND NOTICE CLARIFICATION OF THE AUTHORIZATION FOR LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE CITATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FINES FOR ANY VIOLATIONS -- AND THIRTIES EXTENSION OF THE REPEAL DATE FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSING PROVISIONS.

ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. DOES THIS ALLOW THE IN TERMS OF THE CANNABIS OF THE CIRCUMVENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT. THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT REGULATORY AUTHORITY. SO -- AS IT RELATES TO THAT CANNABIS EQUITY GRANTED DOES HAVE AN ALLOWANCE FOR TWO YEARS -- TO USE GUIDELINES VERSUS THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE FUNDS TO GO OUT SOONER. AND ALLOW THE GOBIZ SOMETIME AND THE BUREAU CAN MISS CONTROLS AND TIME TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM BEFORE AND THEN FORMALIZED THOSE IN REGULATIONS IN FUTURE YEARS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THIS? FOR CONVENTION IS ONLY TEMPORARY THAT THEY HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN AND GO THROUGH THE FULL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING PROCESS YES LATER. OKAY. THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
