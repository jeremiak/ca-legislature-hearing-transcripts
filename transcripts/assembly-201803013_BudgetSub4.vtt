FIVE BOARD MEMBERS THE BOARD

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:47.866 region:rollup2

ONE THE BOARD STOCKETT.

00:27:49.835 --> 00:27:52.671 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A QUICK

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:57.075 region:rollup2
SUMMARY OF.

00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:59.344 region:rollup2
THAT PRODUCTIVITY OF. ISSUES

00:27:57.075 --> 00:28:00.612 region:rollup2

MARION.

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:11.490 region:rollup2
SO THE THE THE THE NEXT QUESTION

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:13.859 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.394 region:rollup2

SHOWS THAT THERE WERE FUNDING OF

00:28:15.394 --> 00:28:19.031 region:rollup2
FOUR FOUR POINT FOUR POSITIONS

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:20.632 region:rollup2
WERE BEING USED IN OTHER PLACES

00:28:19.031 --> 00:28:22.868 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE BUDGET.

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:24.236 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY IS SALARY SAVINGS

00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:26.338 region:rollup2
WE WERE GENERATING A LOT OF

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:28.106 region:rollup2
SALARY SAVINGS A BECAUSE OF THE

00:28:26.338 --> 00:28:30.576 region:rollup2

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:32.077 region:rollup2
WERE INVESTING THAT I IN.

00:28:30.576 --> 00:28:33.946 region:rollup2
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF PER

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:35.614 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT WAS USED TO REPLACE

00:28:33.946 --> 00:28:37.115 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:28:35.614 --> 00:28:39.117 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:41.687 region:rollup2
FIVE OUR CASEMENT WHICH WAS A

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:44.056 region:rollup2

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:46.425 region:rollup2
THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT

00:28:44.056 --> 00:28:47.759 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WAS IMPLEMENTED THE IN

00:28:46.425 --> 00:28:48.961 region:rollup2
THE SEVENTIES WHO IS BEING

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.395 region:rollup2

00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:51.697 region:rollup2
THROUGH SOME OF THE SALARY

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:54.233 region:rollup2
SAVINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

00:28:51.697 --> 00:28:55.934 region:rollup2
GENERATE IN ADDITION SOME COST

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:57.402 region:rollup2
OVERRUNS WITH THE RELOCATION OF

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:58.670 region:rollup2
OUR ALLEY OFFICE HAVE BEEN

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:59.805 region:rollup2
FUNDED THROUGH THOSE SALARY

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.440 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

00:28:59.805 --> 00:29:03.709 region:rollup2
AND IN ADDITION WE WERE LOOKING

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.245 region:rollup2
AT WAYS IN TERMS OF. INCREASING

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:07.980 region:rollup2

00:29:09.781 --> 00:29:12.718 region:rollup2
DOING.

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:15.854 region:rollup2
WITH THE WITH THE SALARY

00:29:12.718 --> 00:29:18.957 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:21.827 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS OR ADDITIONS.

00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:23.629 region:rollup2
THE NEXT QUESTION RELATED TO.

00:29:21.827 --> 00:29:25.397 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING THREE

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:26.765 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO THE BOARD

00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:28.433 region:rollup2
HOW WILL THIS AFFECT THE BUDGET

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:31.036 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A CLASSIC GOOD

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:33.538 region:rollup2
NEWS BAD NEWS SITUATION. THE

00:29:31.036 --> 00:29:34.740 region:rollup2
GOOD NEWS IS FIVE BOARD MEMBERS

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:37.042 region:rollup2
WRITING DECISIONS ALONG WITH

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.710 region:rollup2
LEGAL STAFF IS GOING TO INCREASE

00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:39.845 region:rollup2
THE BOARDS PRODUCTIVITY SO IS

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.280 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

00:29:39.845 --> 00:29:45.550 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE ABLE TO CHIP AWAY AT

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.550 region:rollup2
THE BACKLOG OF CASES THAT ARE

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:49.788 region:rollup2
THAT THE APPOINTMENT OF THOSE

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:51.323 region:rollup2
BOARD MEMBERS IS GOING TO DRY UP

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:52.858 region:rollup2
THE SALARY SAVINGS THAT WE WERE.

00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:54.359 region:rollup2
A ONE TIME MONEY THAT WE WERE

00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:55.360 region:rollup2
USING TO INVEST IN THE

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:57.529 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:03.869 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PER.

00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:04.903 region:rollup2
TO. INCREASE OUR PRODUCTIVITY.

00:30:03.869 --> 00:30:07.305 region:rollup2
AND.

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:09.308 region:rollup2
THE A AND AND WE'RE ALSO

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:11.710 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO USE IT FOR EMPLOYEE

00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:14.379 region:rollup2
RETENTION WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:16.415 region:rollup2
TURN OVER. A OF PURPOSE STAFF AS

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:17.582 region:rollup2
THEY LOOK FOR PROMOTIONAL

00:30:16.415 --> 00:30:19.318 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:20.852 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WE

00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:23.555 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO RETAIN.

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:25.657 region:rollup2
DOES IT INDIVIDUALS AND WE'VE

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.358 region:rollup2
ALSO USED SOME OF THAT SALARY

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.261 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:30.862 region:rollup2
WERE INTENDED TO BE DEVOTED TO

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.130 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

00:30:30.862 --> 00:30:34.633 region:rollup2
THE FINAL QUESTION THAT'S ON

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:36.635 region:rollup2
YOUR AGENDA HAS TO DO WITH.

00:30:34.633 --> 00:30:37.969 region:rollup2
THE TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION

00:30:36.635 --> 00:30:40.305 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR AND

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:41.740 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IMPACT IS

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:43.208 region:rollup2
THAT HAD.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:45.177 region:rollup2
ON PURPOSE WORKLOAD.

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:47.012 region:rollup2
AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IT

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:48.914 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT

00:30:47.012 --> 00:30:50.515 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN WORKLOAD.

00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:54.953 region:rollup2
NOW IT COULD HAVE AN INCREASED

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.288 region:rollup2
IMPACT AWARD COULD ACTUALLY BE

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:58.657 region:rollup2
LESS THAN THEM.

00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:59.558 region:rollup2
MODEST AMOUNT THAT WE'VE.

00:30:58.657 --> 00:31:01.526 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:02.828 region:rollup2
THUS FAR.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.097 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT THAT KINDA

00:31:02.828 --> 00:31:07.265 region:rollup2
CONCLUDES ARE PREPARED RESPONSES

00:31:05.097 --> 00:31:10.302 region:rollup2
BEAT DELIGHTED TO HAVE RESPONDED

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:11.436 region:rollup2
TO QUESTIONS SIR THANK YOU. S.

THE THE THE THE.

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:18.410 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS

00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:20.379 region:rollup2
RETAINING A HIGH POWER OF

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.981 region:rollup2
SEASONED REGIONAL ATTORNEYS.

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:24.583 region:rollup2
THE PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:26.118 region:rollup2
WITHIN PROBE ARE LIMITED.

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:27.886 region:rollup2
AND.

00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:31.423 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR REGIONAL ATTORNEYS

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:32.958 region:rollup2

TO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:39.631 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE STAYING WITHIN THIS

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.566 region:rollup2
STATE SYSTEM.

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.034 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE

WERE ROOF RETAINING A LOT OF

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.471 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT TALENT BUT THE. THE

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:47.706 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT'S NOT

BECAUSE THE THE ARE ANALYSIS

00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:56.248 region:rollup2
INDICATES THAT.

00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:57.416 region:rollup2
THE MORE EXPERIENCE ATTORNEYS

00:31:56.248 --> 00:32:00.018 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY TURNING OUT A

00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:00.786 region:rollup2
HIGHER NUMBER OF CASES THEN THE.

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:03.121 region:rollup2
AND.

00:32:00.786 --> 00:32:04.222 region:rollup2
THEN THE NEW ATTORNEYS.

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.557 region:rollup2

RESOURCES.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:12.123 region:rollup2
IF WE GOT MORE RESOURCES.

AND THEY'VE BEEN THE FOCUS OF

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.778 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:08.313 region:rollup2
THROUGH VARIOUS INITIATIVES BUT

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:10.215 region:rollup2

TAKE MONEY. THAT BELONGS TO SOME

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:03.287 region:rollup2
WORKERS WHO CAN'T GET NOTIFIED

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:05.022 region:rollup2

HAVE?

00:57:59.543 --> 00:58:03.580 region:rollup2
A CASE IN ANYINDUSTRY WHERE

THE EMPLOYER WAS FOUND TO OWE

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.549 region:rollup2

GRANTS AND AND IN DEVELOPING A

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.755 region:rollup2
MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH SO.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:13.923 region:rollup2

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:19.762 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S MORE

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup2

EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO GO

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:35.377 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROGRAM. BASED ON.

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:36.378 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT THEY
