UP AND HAS COME UP IN SOME OF

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:05.290
THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS AND

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.759

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:17.636
ON THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE-

AND THAT'S A- DIFFICULT

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.038

DISCUSSION AND WE THINK THAT'S-

00:17:30.182 --> 00:17:31.984
REASONABLE BUT THERE ARE

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.185

INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH CAN BE

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:40.659
ATTRACTIVE WAYS TO PROMOTE

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.161
JOBS- BUT IF YOU HAVE LIMITED

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:45.164
FUNDING- HOW DO YOU KIND OF-

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.931

UP LIKE I THINK THAT THE-

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.589
QUESTION IS WE REALLY SPOT ON

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:07.325

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.868
ARE WAYS TO OBVIOUSLY IMPROVE

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.036
THE WAY THE VEHICLE INCENTIVE

INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE COULD DO A

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:31.449
BETTER JOB THERE BUT ULTIMATELY

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.284
I THINK BECAUSE OF THE SCALE

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:35.420
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT

00:32:35.486 --> 00:32:38.723
WERE REALLY- NOT ALLOWABLE

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.792
RIGHT THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.860
BE IN TERMS OUT ENCOURAGING

00:32:42.927 --> 00:32:44.395

AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.635
INCEPTION I THINK TWO HUNDRED

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.236
MILLION AS A STARTING POINT OF

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.072
COURSE- BUT REALLY THE QUESTION

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:57.375
AROUND. CONTINUITY IS A KEY ONE

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.310
RIGHT- WHETHER THESE CONSUMERS

00:32:59.377 --> 00:33:01.012
KNOW ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:02.647
IT TAKES YEARS TO EDUCATE

00:33:02.714 --> 00:33:04.949
CONSUMERS BUT IT EVAPORATES ONE

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:06.317
YEAR AND THEN STARTS UP

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:11.055
ANOTHER. DOWN. THE ROAD YOU

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.557
KNOW THOSE ARE. NO WAS ALSO THE-

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:18.363
OF THE- THOSE TYPES OF STARTS.

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:21.032
I GUESS. DIçN OF MISTER BROWN

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.900

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.870
ANYTHING- YEAH I'LL JUST MAYBE

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:28.306
JUST ADD TO- ONE BRIEF

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:31.008
COMMENTS- YOU JUST WANT MORE OF

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:32.143
THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION WHEN

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.344
THINKING ABOUT THE OVERALL

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.146
MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING NEEDED TO

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.581
KIND OF GET TO SOME OF THE

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:37.415
GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID OUT

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.083
AND- I THINK IT'S JUST AROUND

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.918
KIND OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.687
AND KNOWING KIND OF WHAT LEVEL

00:33:42.754 --> 00:33:44.522
OF INCENTIVES NEEDED TO

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:47.258
ENCOURAGE- YOU KNOW CONSUMER

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.926
ADOPTION I THINK THEY'RE YOU

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:49.527
KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:50.995
DIFFERENCE. CHARACTERISTICS

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:53.231
THAT CONSUMERS VALUE AND THEIR

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.298
VEHICLES A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:55.433
FACTORS THAT THEY TAKE INTO

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.002
ACCOUNT THINK. YOU KNOW SYSTEMS

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:58.469
A NICE JOB OF KIND OF

00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.938
IDENTIFYING THE- THE GAP

00:34:01.005 --> 00:34:02.840
BETWEEN KIND OF PURCHASE PRICE

00:34:02.907 --> 00:34:04.776
AND- SAYS VERSUS OTHER

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:07.345
VEHICLES- BUT SOMETIMES I THINK

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:08.279
IT'S IT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:09.247
MORE CHALLENGING TO KNOW KIND

00:34:09.313 --> 00:34:11.015
OF EXACTLY WHAT LEVEL DOES THE

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:12.350
INCIDENT NEED TO BE EXACTLY NOT

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.451
AMOUNTS DOESN'T NEED TO BE A

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:14.786
LITTLE BIT LESS DOESN'T NEED TO

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:16.053
BE MORE IN ORDER TO KIND OF

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.122
ACTUALLY. CHANGE CONSUMER

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:18.890
BEHAVIOR SO I THINK THAT'S KIND

00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.825
OF ONE OF THE OPEN QUESTIONS

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:23.060
THAT MAKES ME OF THIS- YOU KNOW

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:25.129
THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED-

00:34:25.196 --> 00:34:27.265
SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO. ANSWER

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.499
AND SO MAYBE AN AREA FOR KIND

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.168
OF SIZE AND FUTURE EXPLORATION

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:32.003
AND RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE IT

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:33.871
SORT OF BEGS THE QUESTION WHEN

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:35.640
YOU LOOK AT THE I GUESS THE-

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:38.609
HEAD OUT THAT WE HAVE IS IF YOU

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:40.645
THINKING THAT. THE INCENTIVE

00:34:40.711 --> 00:34:41.846
PROGRAM TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.515
BEHAVIOURS BASICALLY TO TWENTY

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.384
TWENTY FIVE YOU GOT FOUR YEARS-

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:48.052
AND THEN THERE'S A SWEET SIXTY

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:48.986
EIGHT MONTHS TO GET A REBATE

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:51.389
THERE'S CLEARLY SOME REFORM

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.191
THAT YOU WOULD PUT MONEY ON THE

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:54.926
HOOD AND SAY IT'S NOT A REBATE

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.594
YOU GET THE MONEY. OFF YOUR

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.463
TAXES ARE OFF YOUR DMV

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.164
SOMETHING SIMPLE THE PEOPLE

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:03.134
HAVE BUT ALSO FRONT LOADED FOR

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:04.635
FOUR YEARS AND SAYING THIS IS

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.604
IT IT'S A BILLION BUCKS AND

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.606
FIRST COME FIRST SERVE YOU YOU

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:09.774
GET YOUR MONEY I DO HAVE A

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.108
QUESTION ON INFRASTRUCTURE

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:12.577
BECAUSE WE GO. THE PRESIDENT'S

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:14.378
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL TALKS ABOUT

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.414
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN PUBLIC

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:18.716
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT NOT NOT

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:20.184
APARTMENT BUILDINGS NOT MY

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:23.554
BACKYARD- IN IF I DO THE MATH

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.756
RIGHT NOW 12% OF THAT WOULD BE

00:35:25.823 --> 00:35:26.724
SIXTY TWO MILLION BUCKS FOR

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:32.997
CALIFORNIA SORT OF. A NICE

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:33.664
NUMBER- THE GOV SCOTT OF.

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.666
DOLLAR THERE. BUT DEPUTY SIGN

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:38.002
HERE TALKING. FOUR TO SIX

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.304
BILLION OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:43.241
AND SO LET'S SAY WE'RE A TWO WE

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:45.376
GET TO SIXTY TWO WERE HORT OF

00:35:45.443 --> 00:35:47.011
THE FOUR BILLION OR MAYBE WE

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.646
MAKE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.281
GOALS BUT THE REST OF THE

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:52.683
TRAJECTORY DOESN'T SHOW AT

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.652
LEAST THE INVESTMENT. IS MY

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:57.054
MATH RIGHT IS THIS IS THIS IS

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.856
THIS GOING TO OUR ARE WE

00:35:58.923 --> 00:35:59.824
MEETING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:01.659
NEEDS FOR THE YEAR TWENTY

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:02.727
TWENTY TWO IF WE GET IT WE SENT

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:05.897
A BILLION BUCKS WE TAKE THE

00:36:05.963 --> 00:36:06.364
MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.534
GOVERNMENT. IT'S A IT'S A GREAT

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:11.769
QUESTION- YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:12.870
GREAT NEWS THAT THE BINDING

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.105
RESTORATION HAS PROPOSED

00:36:14.171 --> 00:36:15.673
INVESTMENTS IN THE CHARGING

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.508
INFRASTRUCTURE. THINGS LIKE

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:19.410
DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING BILL

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:20.945
CERTAINLY COMPLEMENT RIGHT IF

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.513
IT PASSES THROUGH CONGRESS YOU

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.015
KNOW COMPLIMENTS CALIFORNIA

00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:25.750
EFFORT. TO HELP REACH THIS

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:28.119
LARGE TRANSITION GAP ON I'M

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.421
SHOWING WE'RE SHOWING IN TERMS

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:33.190
OF INFRASTRUCTURE. COSTS IT

00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:35.393
WON'T FILL THE ENTIRE NEED

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:37.995
DENTAL- I THINK THAT'S WHERE

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:40.364
THINGS LIKE EASY CHILE PROGRAMS

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:43.467
RIGHT COME INTO PLAY- PRIVATE

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:45.303
INVESTMENTS COME INTO PLAY SO

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.771
THAT'S TRANSITION COSTS I THINK

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.639
THE QUESTION IS. NOT HOW MUCH

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.575
OF TRANSITION COSTS ARE. BUT

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:55.279
REALLY. HOW MUCH SHOULD THE

00:36:55.346 --> 00:36:56.581
PRIVATE. THE SURPRISE AND YOU

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:57.915
TAKE OUT ON HOW MUCH CONSUME

00:36:57.982 --> 00:37:00.785
TAKE THAT ON. FIRST IS OUT

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.086
PUBLIC DOLLARS IN TERMS OF

00:37:02.153 --> 00:37:04.755
PUBLIC. CHANGE AND- HOW LONG DO

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.057
WE NEED TO AS FAR AS IN IT'S

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:08.326
TRUE WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IS. YOU

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:10.461
KNOW OVER THE FIVE NEXT FIVE

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:12.363
SIX YEARS IS A BIG NEED BUT AND

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.465
WE KIND OF HAD A MAGICAL SPOT

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.400
LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH RENEWABLES

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:18.336
AND- WHERE THE INCENTIVES MAY.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:21.973
JUST BASICALLY ARE. I THOUGHT

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:28.179
HE LAST NEEDED OVERTIME. OKAY

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:30.681
THANK YOU SENATOR MCCASKEY WILL

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:36.287
MOVE ON TO SENATOR DOLLY. GOOD

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:37.722
MORNING OR GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:41.626
CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES WE CAN'T.

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.861
MY QUESTION IS A ON THE

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:44.929
INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF IT

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:45.796
ACTUALLY I JUST LOOKED LAST

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:49.867
NIGHT TO. MAYBE PURCHASE A- IS

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:52.003
THAT VEHICLE- BUT IF THE

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.038
STRUCTURE FOR CHARGING WHAT

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.806
WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD IT SEEMS

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:56.707
LIKE TO ME THAT THAT'S ONE OF

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.109
THE BARRIERS THAT ARE HOLDING

00:37:58.175 --> 00:37:59.877
BACK PEOPLE FROM PURCHASING I

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.278
LIKE MYSELF BECAUSE THE

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.480
INFRASTRUCTURE JUST REALLY NOT

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.482
AVAILABLE AND I WOULD HAVE TO

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:05.516
PUT IN A YOU KNOW PUT A

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:09.787
PERSONAL PRIDE. STATION

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:10.321
CHARGING STATION AMOUNT OF

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.889
RESIDENTS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.524
THAT LOOKS LIKE GOING FORWARD

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.092
AND WHAT WHAT WHAT THE NEED IS

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.894
TO GET TO WHERE WE WANT FOR THE

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:19.964
OBJECTIVES TO. MEET THAT- LOFTY

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:28.372
GOALS WE HAVE. SO I CAN TAKE A

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:30.875
AN INITIAL STAB AT IT AND- I

00:38:30.941 --> 00:38:31.809
THINK ACTUALLY THE

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.044
ADMINISTRATION WILL PROBABLY BE

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.612
ABLE TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE A

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:35.746
LOT MORE THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.181
HAS DONE QUITE A BIT OF

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:40.317
ANALYSIS AROUND- INFRASTRUCTURE

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:41.719
AND KIND OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:42.653
MEET THE STATE GOALS I THINK

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.955
JUST. A COUPLE OF NUMBERS MAYBE

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:47.925
AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.728
IS TO MEET ITS TWENTY TWENTY

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:52.496
FIVE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE-

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:54.331
TARGETS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:57.535
THOUSAND- CHARGERS THAT'S ON A

00:38:57.601 --> 00:39:00.104
LEVEL TWO CHARGERS AS WELL AS-

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:01.906
DC FAST CHARGER SO THAT DOESN'T

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:02.873
INCLUDE THE KIND OF HOME

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.008
CHARGERS ARE ONES THAT ARE IN

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:06.243
KIND OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.278
IT'S KIND OF MORE PUBLIC OR

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:09.680
SHARED PRIVATE. CHARGERS RIGHT

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:12.917
NOW I THINK WE'RE AT- CLOSE TO

00:39:12.983 --> 00:39:14.185
SIXTY OR SEVENTY THOUSAND DON'T

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:16.153
QUOTE ME ON THAT EXACTLY BUT

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.288
THERE'S A LOT OF FUN UNITS IN

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.223
THE PIPELINE TO KIND OF BUILD

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:19.623
OUT THAT CHARGING

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.258
INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE NEXT

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:24.128
FEW YEARS AND SO- THERE'S A AS

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.330
A GAP OF ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:27.998
CHARGERS AND I THINK THAT ARE

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:30.901
NEEDED TO KIND OF NEED THAT

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:31.469
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL AND

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.337
THAT'S KIND OF THE- ONE OF THE

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:34.338
MAIN FOCUSES OF THE

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.240
ADMINISTRATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:37.541
PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THE BUDGET

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:38.743
THIS YEAR AND THE BILLION

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:40.745
DOLLARS- AT LEAST A FEW HUNDRED

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:41.746
MILLION OF THAT WILL BE TIME

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:44.849
TO. TO MEET THAT IDENTIFY .COM

00:39:44.915 --> 00:39:46.584
TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.685
ONE PIECE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK

00:39:47.752 --> 00:39:49.420
FURTHER OUT OUT TO TWENTY

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.489
THIRTY AND SOME O THE MORE AN

00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.424
AMBITIOUS GOALS KIND OF LONGER

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:55.726
TERM GOALS- I KNOW SOME OF THE

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:56.727
ENERGY COMMISSION ANALYSES

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.896
SIDES I SAID THAT TO KIND OF BE

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.431
ON TRACK TO MEET THE-

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:01.599
GOVERNOR'S MOST RECENT

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:03.567
EXECUTIVE ORDER GOALS- THE

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:06.170
STATE'S GONNA NEEDS- CLOSE TO

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.972
ONE AND A HALF MILLION CHARGERS

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:08.939
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW AN INCREASE

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:11.008
FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.476
AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO. ONE

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:14.745
AND A HALF MILLION AND TWENTY

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:16.147
THIRTY SO THAT'S A LARGE RAMP

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:17.314
UP AND I THINK YOU'RE PRESS

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:18.382
GETS TO SOME OF THE NUMBERS

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:20.985
THAT- SIMON TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:26.857
AND IN TERMS. OF KIND OF

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:27.458
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED AND I DO

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.058
JUST WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT

00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:28.726
ANY OTHER POINT THAT YOU MAY AS

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:29.460
WELL AS- ONE OF THE BIG

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:30.694
QUESTIONS THINK IS. AND WHAT

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.295
THE STATE'S ROLE WILL NEED TO

00:40:31.362 --> 00:40:32.396
BE AND- SUPPORTING NOT

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:33.130

BRING- TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR

00:41:15.272 --> 00:41:16.974
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AT THE

WELL FOR THE LAST. TWO DIGITS-

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:24.982
FOR TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:27.885
HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.554
IN CONVERSATION- TODAY WE'VE

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:32.223
NOT HEARD ABOUT HYDROGEN AND

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:35.559
HOW THAT IS- IT NECESSARY TO

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:40.431
PLAY IN THE GOLD OF THE FUTURE.

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:40.965
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:41.599
THIRTY FIVE BELIEVE IT OR NOT

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:43.500
IS AROUND THE CORNER WITH WITH-

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:46.503
WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:47.538
SO MUCH ON OUR PLATE. AND I

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:49.740
UNDERSTAND THAT IN TWENTY

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.809
EIGHTEEN I THINK- OUR GOAL WAS-

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:52.710
TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:56.013
STATIONS- AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:56.914
THOUSAND ELECTRIC FEUDING.

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:59.617
CHARGING STATIONS SO IF WE'RE

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:02.486
LOOKING TO COMBINE HYDROGEN AND

00:42:02.553 --> 00:42:03.821
WITH IT AND I AM HOPING THAT WE

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:05.456
ARE WE'VE GT TO THINK ABOUT

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:07.558
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT AS YOU

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.593
TALK ABOUT THE ELECTRIC FUELING

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.662
STATIONS- YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.097
ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:14.531
EDISON COMPANY IN A PARTNERSHIP

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:16.166
WITH SOME ELECTRIC COMPANIES.

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:17.902
IS THAT SOLELY GOING TO BE OUR

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.837
RESPONSIBILITIES STATE TO

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.739
ESTABLISH THESE VARIOUS FUELING

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:24.375
STATIONS AT LOCAL PARKS MARKETS

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.677
WHEREVER THEY MIGHT BE. AND

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:29.847
ALSO IT IS IT IT'S A IT'S A

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.482
NECESSARY I THINK FOR ALL OF US

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:33.183
RIGHT NOW TO UNDERSTAND. THAT

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.552
IF WE DON'T ADD HYDROGEN TO OUR

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.687
GOALS WE'RE GOING TO FALL

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.289
SHORT. AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:41.592
TALKING ABOUT- SMALL VEHICLES

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.494
PURSES LARGER TRUCKS AND SO ON

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.795
AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.096
THESE LARGE TRUCKS COMING OUT

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:49.066
OF- THE CHAIRMAN'S LOCATION AND

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.534
OUT OF THE PORT OF LONG BEACH.

00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.837
CANNOT HANDLE A BATTERY RUN

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:57.041
HUGE HUGE EIGHTEEN WHEELER. BUT

00:42:57.107 --> 00:42:59.944
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE. A EIGHTEEN

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.446
WHEELER CAN BE RUN ON HYDROGEN.

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:04.548
AND TOWARD LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:06.383
ON THAT AND SHE HOW WEAK YOU

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:07.785
FEEL THAT HYDROGEN MIGHT BE

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:11.588
PART OF THIS ENTIRE- SUBJECT

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:13.123

QUESTION. I CAN GET THIS I

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:24.735
THINK. THAT QUESTION ON. YES IT

00:43:24.802 --> 00:43:26.203
SHOULD THE PRESENTATION DIDN'T

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.972
FOCUS ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.206
WHICH INCLUDES PLUG IN

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.574
ELECTRICS AND SHE'LL SELL

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:33.610
VEHICLES WE DO SEE A ROLE TO

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:34.878
PLAY ON THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.081
DUTY TRUCK SIDE FOUR HUNDRED IN

00:43:37.147 --> 00:43:38.716
FUEL CELL TRUCK DEPLOYMENT

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:40.017
ACTUALLY THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:41.585
COST NUMBERS I SHOWED. INCLUDED

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:45.422
BOTH THE HYDROGEN AS WELL AS-

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:49.259
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:50.561
KNOW I'M THE YOU KNOW HORSE IN

00:43:50.627 --> 00:43:53.263
THE RIGHT NOW- THERE ARE WARM

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.065
MODELS ALECTRA PEOPLE'S BEING

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:58.802
DEPLOYED- FIFTY TO SIXTY RIGHT

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:01.638
NOW- NOT AS MANY AT FROM THE

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:04.408
HYDROGEN SIDE BUT I DO THINK.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:06.543
IT IS WORTH. TAKING A CLOSER

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.447
LOOK AT WHETHER OR IN THE-

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:13.317
LATER YEARS TWENTY THIRTY

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.418
TWENTY FORTY WHETHER THE TWO

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.687
HUNDRED MILLION I'M TWO HUNDRED

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.555
STATIONS TARGETED HOW HOW THAT.

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:19.490
IT WILL THAT BE SUFFICIENT

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:22.393
WILL- THEY BE WELL UTILIZED HOW

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.495
DO YOU PUT TOGETHER THE VEHICLE

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.363
AND FEELS TOGETHER IN TERMS OF

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.532
THE INVESTMENTS ON TO MAKE SURE

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.868
THAT EIGHT. FORTY NINE EXCEPT

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:34.405
AS A PRIOR- CENTER SAD. YOU

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:36.206

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:38.308
VEHICLE YOU REALLY NEED TO.

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:40.277
HAVE INSURANCE SAYS THAT YOU

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.179
KNOW THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE NOT

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:43.347
JUST AT THE HOME OF PUBLIC

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.215
INFRASTRUCTURE AND REALLY THAT

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:46.717
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.552
THOSE INTEREST AFTER HAAS

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:52.856
RIGHT. ET AL MAN YOU DIDN'T DIE

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.258
IN THE STRIP OF HIGHWAY RIGHT

00:44:54.324 --> 00:44:56.293
IT WAS A COLLECTIVE DECISION

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.530
TO. TO CREATE A NETWORK RIGHT

00:44:59.596 --> 00:45:00.764
WHETHER IT BE THAT THE

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:03.200
TELEPHONE POLES OF OLDER. AND

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.569
THE CELL NETWORKS AND HIGHWAYS-

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.871
ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE SORT OF

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:10.074
THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT A GOOD

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:17.047
COMPONENT. IT NEEDS TO BE A

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:18.048
PUBLIC BUS. I'D LIKE TO FOUR

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.550
AND OUT THAT BEARD MICHAEL IS

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.952
TO PAY. OF ELECTRIC VERSUS. BY

00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:24.621
TO MAKE IT A- IN OUR GOAL- FOR

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:27.191
OUR ECONOMY AND NOT ONLY ARE

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:30.527
ARE- ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON BUT

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:31.395
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT NINE BY

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:32.596
TWO TO DO THIS PRESENT MADAM

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:34.098
CHAIR I'D LIKE TO. INVITE YOU

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.433
DO THIS WITH IS WELL CAL STATE

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.069
LA. RIGHT OUTSIDE MY DISTRICT.

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.938
THE ENTIRE FLEET OF CAL STATE

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.172
ARE LAKE VIDEO BECAUSE OUR RUN

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.674
ON HYDROGEN THEY HAVE A

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.409
HYDROGEN FUELING STATION. LOOKS

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.411
LIKE A MINI GAS STATION. AND

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.846
THEY RUN ALL THEIR POLICE

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.048
VEHICLES SCHOOL VEHICLES AND I

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.449
BELIEVE THEY HAVE SOMEWHERE

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.685
ABOUT TO TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY

00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:56.620
VEHICLES. AND PRETTY EFFICIENT

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:58.055
AND IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AS

00:45:58.122 --> 00:46:01.492
WELL SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.593
A LOOK AT THAT- BECAUSE I THINK

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.727
I HEARD SOMEONE MENTION THEY

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:06.096
HAD TO. INSTALL THE- THE

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.632
ELECTRIC- HOOK UP AT THEIR

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:11.335
HOME- WELL IF THE HYDROGEN IT

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:12.970
IS THERE IN A PUBLIC LOCATION

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:14.738
AT GAS STATIONS AS THERE IS ONE

00:46:14.805 --> 00:46:17.007
HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEN WE

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:18.642
HAVE A LEG UP. ON

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.611
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE NEEDED TO

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:22.746
PUT THAT ON THE LINE AND- AND

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.847
MAKE IT PART OF OUR FUTURE

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.349
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:28.051
ARCHULETA AND I HAVE A QUESTION

AND I THINK ALL DIRECT THIS TO

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:32.389
DEPUTY DIRECTOR ME AS WELL-

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.992
YOU'D MENTIONED AND THE- BAD TO

SAY THAT YOU HAD SUGGESTED THAT

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.461
WE- SEE THAT CALIFORNIA WAS

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:38.629
LAST FOR CHARGING

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:39.997
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WE'VE-

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.598
MENTIONED THAT. AND NUMEROUS

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.901
TIMES. AND SPECIFICALLY YOU

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.169
CALL THAT THE MULTI DWELLING

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:48.038
UNIT- UP PROGRAMS WOULD BE A

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.474
GOOD START SO. SINCE WE'RE SO

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.508
BEHIND AND I KNOW THAT THERE

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.043
HAS BEEN SOME- PIECES OF

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.179
LEGISLATION THAT OF REDUCE

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.146
BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR MULTI

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:57.981
DWELLING UNIT. OF PROPERTIES

00:46:58.048 --> 00:46:59.249
BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.652
AROUND- THAT AND HOW WE CAN

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:04.788
ACCELERATE THAT AND ESPECIALLY

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:05.422
YOU KNOW. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:06.990
IS IN SPACES LIKE LOW INCOME

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.692
COMMUNITIES IT TRULY REALLY

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:10.494
NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:14.565
INVESTMENTS THERE. YEAH YEAH

00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:16.366
IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION IN

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:18.402
THE DEPLOYMENT TO ENSURE ACCESS

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.504
RIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEPLOY

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:22.806
INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGY C. IS

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.976
PART OF THE- A GROUP OF

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.378
COALITION OF GROUPS INCLUDING-

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:29.947
GREEN LINING AND COALITION FOR

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:33.116
CLEAN AIR- ADVOCATING RIGHT NOW

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.752
OR- INVESTMENTS YOU JOINED

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:40.023
ASPIN INSPITE- TO COMMISSION

AND AS WELL AS AT THE PUCT. TO

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:45.762
ENSURE THAT THERE IS EQUITY

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:48.498
TARGETS THAT ARE ARE FAILED IN

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:50.601
TERMS OF DEPLOYMENT A LOT OF

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:53.337
THOSE INVESTMENTS TODAY- ARE

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:54.838
ARE BEING STARTING TO BE

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.074
TARGETED IS JUST A START THOUGH

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.408
AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THOSE

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.544
MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS ARE

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.245
CRITICAL IN PLACES WHERE YOU

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:03.247
REALLY. YOU KNOW THE TENANT

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:06.083
DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

IN CHARGING- IN BATTERY

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:05.255

STILL WE DO LEAVE THAT NATION

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:20.937
AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:52:21.004 --> 00:52:22.472

THE MARKET- AND CARS AND I

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.909

ESTABLISHING THEIR ROLES AND

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.526
OBJECTIVES OF AGENCIES A MAJOR

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.061
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OF WHO'S

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:53.730

HAS ALL THE ANSWERS WE HAVE TO

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.538
DO THIS TOGETHER AND THEN

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:02.806
FINALLY ENSURING THAT WE'RE

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.007

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.475
THEM FORWARD NOT JUST FOR OUR-

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.143
OWN IMPLEMENTATION BUT FOR A

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.545
FUTURE STATE TONIGHT. I GOT A

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:09.679
TRUCK A LITTLE BIT THAT CENTER

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:10.814
WHITE HOUSE MEANS THAT DON'T

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.082
USE THE WORD IN POWER AND I.

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:13.650
WAS ALREADY MY FLIGHTS BUT- IT

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:14.951
WE DO MEAN THAT IS TRYING TO

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.586
PUT IN POWER MARKET ACTORS TO

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.588
EXCEED EXPECTATIONS IS. PUTTING

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:19.889
POWER IN DECISION MAKING AS

00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:21.725
CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND IS

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:22.759
CLOSE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AS

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:27.564
POSSIBLE. AND SO. ALL THE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:28.465
STRESS. IS AROUND THE SKY OF

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:29.666
CORE IMAGE. AND THE IDEA THAT

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.434
THERE YOU KNOW FOR. PILLARS OF

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:33.670
THE MARKET WE HAVE THE VEHICLES

00:54:33.737 --> 00:54:36.373
INFRASTRUCTURE END USERS AND

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:37.574
WORK FORCE AND WE NEED ALL FOUR

00:54:37.641 --> 00:54:40.677
PILLARS. TO BE AN IMBALANCE TO

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:41.878
BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE MARKET

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.847
TOGETHER. HALF ONE FALLS BEHIND

00:54:43.913 --> 00:54:45.281
WE WE'VE LACKS IT JUST AS WE

00:54:45.348 --> 00:54:46.983
JUST TALK ABOUT IFRASTRUCTURE

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:47.517
WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.953
ENABLE VEHICLES. AND VICE VERSA

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.221
IT'S BUILT ON A FOUNDATION OF

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.123
OUR CORE PRINCIPLES THE FIRST

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.357
ONE AND I'M- INTENSELY THE

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.892
FIRST ONE IS. MAKING SURE THAT

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:56.826
WE HAVE EQUITY IN EVERY

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:58.294
DECISION AND EVERY ACTION SO

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:00.096
IT'S REALLY TAKING. A PRIORITY

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:02.499
COMMUNITY NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT AS

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:03.299
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR

00:55:03.366 --> 00:55:04.934
PLANS. IT'S THE IDEA OF

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.736
EMBRACING ALL THAT PATHWAY SETS

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:07.671
YOU KNOW BATTERY ELECTRIC AND

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.072
FUEL CELL ELECTRIC IT'S HIGH

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:10.640
SPEED RAIL IT'S EVERYTHING THAT

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.575
CAN HELP. GET PEOPLE OUT OF AND

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.678
COMBUSTION VEHICLES AND INTO

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.579
CLEAN MODES OF TRANSPORTATION.

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:17.781
THAT'S VOTES IN A COLLECTIVE

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:18.448
PROBLEM SOLVING WHICH I'VE

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:20.116
ALREADY TOUCHED ON. THE IDEA

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:21.785
THAT PUBLIC POLICY COMPLIMENTS

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:24.287
PRIVATE. INVESTMENT WE REALLY

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.022
NEED PRIVATE CAPITAL HELP SCALE

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:27.257
THIS MARKET IT'S ONE THING TO

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:28.558
GET AT THE TO SEE THE MARKET

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:29.626
WITH PUBLIC CAPITAL BUT THE

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.061
PRIVATE CAPITAL HAS TO COME AND

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:32.862
TO GET READY TO GO AND THAT. WE

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:34.230
HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER AND THEN

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.665
FINALLY THE DESIGNING FOR

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:38.034
RESILIENCE AND OUT ADAPTATION.

00:55:38.101 --> 00:55:39.335
SO IT'S BOTH A CHALLENGE AND AN

00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:40.603
OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW YOU LOOK

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.805
AT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION YOU

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.739
COULD USE THAT ACTUALLY

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:44.441
INCREASE. THE ROBUSTNESS AND

00:55:44.507 --> 00:55:46.176
RESILIENCE OF THE GRID. ALL

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.143
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO FEET UP

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.545
INTO THESE CORE OUTCOMES YOU

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:49.979
KNOW BETTER AIR QUALITY REDUCE

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:52.048
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND

00:55:52.115 --> 00:55:53.516
CRUDE AND IMPROVE MOBILITY

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.351
ACCESS- YOU LOOK AT THE PARTY

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.720
COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR AND

00:55:56.786 --> 00:55:58.421
THEN. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

00:55:58.488 --> 00:55:59.923
JOBS ALL HOLDING OUT INTO YOU

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:05.161
KNOW LARGE. SCALE CAPITAL

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:05.695
MARKET DEVELOPMENT. SO THE

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.063
OVERALL. THAT WOULD TALK WITH

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.764
LOOK BIT UP WITH THE STORE SO

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.199
WE HAVE. AS THEIR STRATEGY WHY.

00:56:09.265 --> 00:56:10.166
WHICH KINDA HOUSES ALL THE

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:11.868
LATEST INFORMATION THE

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:14.637
DOCUMENTS THE PROGRESS METRICS.

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:15.238
THAT WE'RE THAT WILL BE GOING

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.507
THROUGH. AND FROM THERE WE

00:56:17.574 --> 00:56:18.608
HOUSE BOTH IT DOES THAT

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:20.110
STRATEGY DOCUMENTS THIS IS

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.144
REALLY KIND OF OUR GUIDING

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.882
DOCUMENT. THAT I'M- YOU KNOW

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.217
IT'S UPDATED EVERY THREE YEARS

00:56:27.283 --> 00:56:29.786
WE- SET OUT THE PRINCIPLES THE

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.286
CORE OBJECTIVES IN THE

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:32.756
DIRECTION. I'M I HAVE TH TABLE

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:35.592
HERE IS THAT NGOS TO TABLE NINE

00:56:35.658 --> 00:56:36.626
AND THEN IN THE DOCUMENT ITSELF

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.294
I PUT THEIR PURPOSE IS NOT JUST

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:39.696
STATE AGENCIES AS WE NEED

00:56:39.763 --> 00:56:41.264
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ALL OF THESE

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.766
PARTNERS SO. WE HAVE THAT YOU

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:44.033
KNOW HIGH LEVEL THEY HAVE

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:45.268
CONNECTION THE EQUITY

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:46.035
CONNECTION AND THEN THE

00:56:46.102 --> 00:56:47.937
CONNECTION INTO THE PILLARS.

00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:49.672
AND WITHIN EACH OF THESE GROUPS

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.174
GROUPINGS LIKE NGOS OR FEDERAL%

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.642
GOVERNMENT OR STATE AGENCIES

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:55.078
WE'VE IDENTIFIED. I'LL LEAVE

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.846
YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO LEADS AND

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:59.716
SUPPORT FUNCTIONS WITHIN EACH

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:01.518
OF THESE PILLARS. I'M WITHIN

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:02.552
THAT DOCUMENT WE'VE GOT A

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.220
LITTLE DEEPER ON THE AGENCIES

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.989
SO WE SET OUT CLEAR OBJECTIVES

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.590
SO USE GO BUSINESS AN EXAMPLE

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.626
THE FIRST ONE BEING. ORGANIZING

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:10.727
IS THAT STRATEGY AND ITS

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.162
CONNECTION INTO THE PILLARS AND

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:14.063
THEN WE'VE ALSO ADDED. THE

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.366
DOCUMENTS THAT.ARE PRODUCED BY

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:18.001
OUR AGENCIES TO HELP MOVE THE

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.569
MARKET FORWARD AND INCREASED

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.403
UNDERSTANDING IF YOU LOOK AT

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.272
SOME AGENCIES LIKE CARPOOL HERE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:23.873
FROM IN A MOMENT. IF YOU HAVE A

00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.475
VERY LONG LIST OF DOCUMENTS BUT

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.143
THEY ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:30.013
AND ADDRESS KEY QUESTIONS

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:32.148
WITHIN THE SUBMARKET. SO IT'S

00:57:32.215 --> 00:57:34.484
ONE THING TO HAVE. OBJECTIVES

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.619
AND STRATEGY. ANY OF THE ACT

00:57:36.686 --> 00:57:37.754
BILL THAT EXIT STRATEGY IT'S

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:40.190
HARD BUT IT. IS EASY EXECUTION

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:42.058
AS HARD. THE STATE AGENCY

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.493
ACTION PLANS ARE REALLY ABOUT

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.161
EXECUTIONS WE HAVE TWENTY NINE

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:46.796
STATE AGENCIES BET EMBEDDED IN

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.531
THIS PLAN. AND EVERY YEAR THEY

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.200
SAY THERE IS A MEETING. AND

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:52.302
ANNUAL ACTION PLANS WHAT WE'VE

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:54.070
DONE IS CHALLENGE THE AGENCIES

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.338
TO TAKE THOSE OBJECTIVES AND

00:57:55.405 --> 00:57:56.773
THEN PUT OUT THE KEY RESULTS

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.675
THAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE. WITH A

00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:02.212
FOCUS. ON COLLABORATION IN

00:58:02.278 --> 00:58:03.546
EQUITY. AT THE END OF EACH YEAR

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:04.247
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THOSE FEW

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.982
RESULTS A MEASURE AGAINST THEM

00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:07.383
WHAT DO WE GET SHE WHERE DID WE

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:09.018
FALL SHORT WELL WHAT CAN WE

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:10.787
LEARN AND TO APPLY THAT MOVING

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:12.455
FORWARD. SO THESE ARE ALL

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:14.290
POSTED OUR WEBSITE HANKER YOU

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:15.592
TAKE A LOOK AT FUND CLICK

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.993
AROUND THAT WE WE'RE A LITTLE

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.661
BIT LOOSE ON THAT DESIGN IT'S

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:19.929
YOU'LL SEE SOME BUT DIFFERENT

00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:21.531
THAN OTHERS. BUT THE DIRECTION

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.266
IS REALLY TO BE CONCISE OF THAT

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.234
YOU KNOW WE CAN GO IN AND

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.301
QUICKLY UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.736
AGENCY IS UP TO AND HOW IT

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.472
CONNECTS OTHER AGENCIES AND

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:31.007
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND THEN.

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.175
FINALLY YOU MOVING FORWARD WE

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:33.443
WE'RE WORKING THIS IS. UNDER

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:34.577
DEVELOPMENT BUT IT'S WHAT

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.312
RECLINER. IN A PILLAR PRIORITY

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.081
ACTION PLANS. THE ONE OF THEM

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.515
SENDING EQUITY ENGAGEMENT WHICH

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:40.283
THEY DON'T HAVE SKETCHED OUT

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.684
HERE. BUT IT'S REALLY PUTTING

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.219
ALL THE ENGAGEMENT WE DO AS

00:58:43.286 --> 00:58:44.554
THIS AS A STATE ALL THAT.

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.489
ACROSS ALL AGENCIES UNDER ONE

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.791
DOCUMENTS AND ONE ROOF. TO MAKE

00:58:48.858 --> 00:58:50.627
SURE THAT WE ARE. REACHING OUT

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.295
TO THE PRIORITY COMMUNITIES AND

00:58:52.362 --> 00:58:54.364
THAT ORGANIZED. COLLECTIVE WAY.

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:55.198
AND THAT WE'RE FEEDING THAT

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.299
INFORMATION INTO ALL OF OUR

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.901
PROCEEDINGS REGULATORY

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:59.802
DEVELOPMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS.

00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:01.004
AND THE SECOND ONE IS KIND OF

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.405
THIS IDEA OF THIS MULTI COLOR

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:04.641
ACTION PLAN. SO VERY SIMILAR TO

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:05.708
THE STATE ACTION PLANS THIS IS

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.677
MORE OF A COLLECTIVE VIEW WHAT

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:08.778
ARE THE- KEY THINGS WE'RE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.513
TRYING TO ADVANCE- THIS YEAR.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.748
THE TAKE THAT THAT'S KIND OF

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:13.483
THIS COLORFUL CIRCLE HERE THE

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.917
IDEA THAT YOU KNOW

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:15.485
INFRASTRUCTURE IS AN ENABLER

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:15.985
WHAT WE GONNA DO UNDER

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:17.587
INFRASTRUCTURE THIS YEAR. WE

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.855
NEED TO CHANGE BEHAVIORAND YOU

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:20.990
GET PEOPLE THE YES. WHAT WE

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:21.658
GONNA DO THERE AND MEASURE

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.493
AGAINST. ONCE YOU HAVE THOSE

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.194
TWO COMPONENTS SCALE IS REALLY

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:26.562
IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT INCREASING

00:59:26.629 --> 00:59:27.864
INVESTOR CONFIDENCE THAT'S HOW

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.265
WE GET FROM WHERE WE- WHERE WE

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:30.400
ARE TODAY TO WHERE WE NEED TO

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:31.968
BE. AND THEN FINALLY IS THE

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:33.069
IDEA OF BUILDING THE INDUSTRY

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.737
IN CALIFORNIA YOU'LL HEAR FROM.

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.039
YOUR WHOLE CHILL ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.407
IF THIRTY FOUR AS THAT

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.242
MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.343
GET ATTRACT A LOT OF THE

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.211
CAPITAL- AND SO THERE'S A BIG

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.546
OPPORTUNITY TO GREAT. AT

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:45.415
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOBS.

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.616
AND FINALLY THERE'S A LOT TO DO

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.084
AN IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE LASER

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:49.519
FOCUSED ON THAT. IMPLEMENTATION

00:59:49.585 --> 00:59:51.321
AND EXECUTION. AND THEN BELOW

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.022
THAT. WITHIN THE PILLARS THERE

00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:54.524
IT'S IN COMMON BUT SHARED

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.625
UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE THAT

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:56.793
WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOPMENTS

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.194
ITS USE MY HAND WRITING HERE

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.128
ABOUT A LOT OF FUN WITH MY- MY

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.030
SERVICE. AND THE FACT. IDEA

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:01.664
HERE IS YOU KNOW WITHIN

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:02.932
VEHICLES INFRASTRUCTURE END

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.001
USERS WORKFORCE. EACH OF THOSE

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.003
HAS AND THEN I LIKE THE METRIC

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.438
THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP OUT.

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.773
AND FURTHER. REINFORCED TO

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.475
HELP. COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:13.710
WHERE WE ARE IN THE MARKET.

VEHICLE CLASSES WERE SEEKING- A

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.022
LOT OF THIS MOMENTUM IS BEING

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.624
DRIVEN IS REALLY. ROOTED IN THE

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:50.760
REDUCTION IN THE BATTERY COSTS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.528
SO WE'VE SEEN A NINETY PERCENT.

REDUCTION IN THE COST OF

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:54.897
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES OVER THE

LAST TEN YEARS. AND THERE'SA

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.134
LOT MORE COST TO COME OUT OF

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.302
THE BATTERY PACK REPRESENTS

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.370
ABOUT HALF THE COST. OF THE

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.573
VEHICLES BUT BECAUSE THE WHOLE

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.241

COMPANY IN THE WORLD IS NOW

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:12.114
INVESTING IN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.717
MODELS. AND ARE BLOOMBERG NEW

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:15.651
ENERGY FINANCE WHICH TRACKS

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:18.554
THIS- REPORTS THERE WILL BE A

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.056
HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN NEW

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.158
MODELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.259
COMING TO THE NORTH AMERICA

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.728

SCALE. I AM IN GROW FOR

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.144
CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THAT- ONE

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.345
OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE THAT

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.180
IS A GOOD SIGN AS AS WE CHARGE

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.249
THESE VEHICLES. OF THE VEHICLES

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:23.386
GET CLEANER EVERY YEAR BECAUSE

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:24.987
THE ELECTRIC PORTFOLIOS

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:27.490
CLEANING UP SO. LAST YEAR- WE

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:31.360
HAD 63% OF THE ELECTRICITY. IN

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:33.062
CALIFORNIA COMING FROM CARBON

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.363
FREE SOURCES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ON

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.699
ROUTE. TWO HUNDRED PERCENT- NOW

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.434
INCALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S A

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:45.041
NICE FEATURE- AS WELL- I DO

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:48.311
WANNA. OUT THAT- YOU. MISTER

SENTENCE THROUGH THE ENERGY.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.084
QUICK TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM SO

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.385
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:57.653
THIS. BILLION DOLLARS IT DOES

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.655
NOT REALLY APPLY TO THE PROGRAM

01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:01.824
IS MANAGED BY. THE RESOURCES

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.192
BOARD THAT- MY COLLEAGUE

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.026
WILLIAM RANDOLPH IS GONNA TALK

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:06.228
ABOUT- IN ADEPT SO THERE'S

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.931
REALLY THREE FUNDING STREAMS

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:09.565
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THERE IS THE

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.934
MONEY. YOU HAVE ASKED US TO

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:14.003
DEPLOY AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:14.403
THROUGH THE CLEAN

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.971
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THERE

01:06:16.038 --> 01:06:17.907
IS THE MONEY. INVESTED BY

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:19.342
UTILITIES WHICH MY COLLEAGUE

01:06:19.408 --> 01:06:20.943
CLIFF WRECK SHOP IS GOING TO BE

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.244
SPEAKING ABOUT AND THERE'S

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.612
MONEY FROM SETTLEMENTS LIKE

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.147
OTHER B. W. SOMEONE LIKE FIVE

ERICA. SO WE'RE WE ARE TODAY-

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:31.954
WE HAVE SEVENTY THOUSAND

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.156
GOAL FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.991
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. WE

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.259
THAT'S ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.294
MILLION HAPPY OF COURSE WHICH

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.762
IS THE- THE BILL WE BELIEVE

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.397
WE'RE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:44.500
CHARGER SHORT. OF THAT SO- THIS

01:06:44.567 --> 01:06:45.267
THIS FUNDING WE'RE TALKING

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.336
ABOUT- WILL HELP. CLOSE THAT

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.538
GAP BY TWENTY THIRTY THE GOAL

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.107
IS TO HAVE ONE AND A HALF

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.576
MILLION BY TWO CHARGERS AND TWO

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:54.810
HUNDRED THOUSAND. HEAVY DUTY

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:56.512
CHARGES TO SUPPORT A TOTAL OF

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.047
EIGHT MILLION. ZERO EMISSION

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.082
VEHICLES- IS TO GET A SENSE OF

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.485
COST SO TYPICAL LEVEL TWO

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.620
CHARGER. WHICH IS THAT'S THE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.789
VAST MAJORITY CHARGES GOING. WE

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.190
SPENT ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.558
DOLLARS PER CHARGER ON THAT

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.360
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT A THIRD

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.796
OF THE COST- SO WE'RE WE'RE

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.231
PROVIDING THIS INCENTIVE IN THE

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:21.604
WE'RE LEVERAGING. PRIVATE

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:23.105
INVESTMENT. FOR SCHOOL BUS IT'S

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.340
SIX CAME THE CHARGE. TRANSIT

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:26.342
BUS REYES FROM C. TO TWO

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.911
THOUSAND- AND THEN DUTY. M.

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:30.312
HEAVY DUTY- TO BE SIXTY ALL THE

01:07:30.379 --> 01:07:31.480
WAY UP TO TWO HUNDRED TWO

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:35.251
THOUSAND- SO THERE'S A QUESTION

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:38.020
EARLIER ABOUT HYDROGEN- WE HAVE

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.155
FORTY FIVE HYDROGEN STATIONS

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.923
ARE OPEN NOW THE GOAL FOR THE

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.058
STATE THAT WE'RE PURSUING IS.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.461
TWO HUNDRED STATIONS BY TWENTY

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:46.462
TWENTY FIVE WE PROJECT AT THIS

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:47.930
POINT WILL BE TWENTY ONE

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.065
STATIONS SHORT BY THAT TIME HI

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.001
THE AVERAGE COST FOR HYDROGEN

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:54.003
STATION FOR US IS ONE POINT

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.904
THREE MILLION IN THAT

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.605
REPRESENTS ABOUT HALF OF THE

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:59.975
COST THE TOTAL COST- I DID WANT

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.410
TO MENTION AS WELL WE HAVE A

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.746
GOAL THEIR TUITION TO DO 50% OF

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.014
OUR CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE LOW

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.015
INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.350
COMMUNITIES- AND I WOULD POINT

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.718
OUT ONE. ONE POSITIVE

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:11.353
DEVELOPING THIS HAPPENED LAST

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.255
YEAR'S IS A REALLY HEALTHY

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.890
RESALE MARKET A SECONDARY

01:08:14.957 --> 01:08:16.759
MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:20.162
YOU CAN FIND OUT A USED NISSAN

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.730
LEAF FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:23.165
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TYPICALLY

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:27.069
NOT GOING TO BUY. A NEW VEHICLE

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.137
ANYWHERE. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:29.405
IS A IS A PRICE THAT DOES NOT

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:31.040
WORK. WITHOUT UBIQUITOUS

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:33.409
CHARGING AND SO REALLY. ARE WE

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:36.011
WANT TO CHARGING TO BE LIKE.

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.413
YOUR PHONE WHEN YOU GET A PHONE

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.415
YOU NEVER WORRY ABOUT WHERE AM

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:40.549
I GOING TO FIND LECTURES

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.518
OPPONENTS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR-

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.619
HOMES AND OFFICES AND WE HAVE

01:08:43.686 --> 01:08:45.087
TO GET THEIR PARTICULARLY FOR

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.288
LOW INCOME SO I ACTUALLY SEE

01:08:46.355 --> 01:08:48.324
THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. AS A

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.326
NECESSITY I SEE IT AS A AS A

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.428
DANCE INSTRUCTOR JUST AS AN

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.196
EQUITY STRATEGY ACTUALLY. I

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:55.531
WANTED WHEN I WANT TO MENTION

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.199
THAT IS ALSO THINK OF POSITIVE

01:08:57.266 --> 01:09:00.469
FEEDBACK CYCLE. IS THAT-

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:01.937
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING FOR

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:04.173
THE FEW THINGS THAT. GIVES US

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.008
ACTUALLY DOWNWARD FORCE ON

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.077
ELECTRIC RATES SO. ALLERGIC

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.144
VEHICLES HAVE ALREADY

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:10.379
CONTRIBUTED ABOUT A BILLION

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:12.581
DOLLARS TO THE RATE BASE AND SO

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:13.782
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS GOING TO THE

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.718
OIL INDUSTRY IS NOW COMING IN.

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:16.919
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO SPREAD THOSE

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.555
FIXED COSTS OVER. MORE KILOWATT

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:20.956
HOURS ENOUGH TO POWER FORCE

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.825
WHICH IS A POSITIVE. A POSITIVE

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:25.561

CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES. WE HAVE

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.365
BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO

TIMES THAT ARE MOST BENEFICIAL

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.613
OR LESS STRESSFUL THE GREAT

01:30:18.679 --> 01:30:20.848
SUCH AS OVERNIGHT. AND THAT

01:30:20.915 --> 01:30:23.317
ALSO SAVE CONSUMERS MONEY SO

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:25.319

THE COST OF FUELING THEIR CAR

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.935
AT A GAS STATION. THE THIRD

01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:42.837
AREA AS VERY PROMISING AREAS

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.438
THAT WERE DEVELOPING AND ALSO

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:45.873
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ENERGY

GRID. AND SAVE CUSTOMERS MONEY

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.265
THAT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.000
SMART CHARGING WHICH IS

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:15.236
CHARGING AT TIMES THAT ARE BEST

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.038

EXACTLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:33:05.513 --> 01:33:05.947
SEVEN THOUSAND ELECTRIC

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.648
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WE ALL

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:09.850
KNOW THAT WE HAVE ARE THE NEVER

ONE SIXTIETH OF THE VEHICLES

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:17.058

THAT THAT HAS TO THE STATE. AND

01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.371
THEN THE OBVIOUS QUESTION AFTER

IT'S NICE TO TALK I'M BLEEDING

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.248

RIGHT THING I FELT SO RIGHTEOUS

01:33:46.053 --> 01:33:47.755
BEING THE SENATOR VOTING FOR

THE RESULTS THAT WE FIND SO

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:58.299
DESIRABLE. YEAH SO I THINK ONE

01:33:58.366 --> 01:34:00.101
THING ON THE NUMBER AND YOU

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.870
KNOW THAT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:04.305
SEVEN THOUSAND THAT WAS IN THE-

01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:06.007
THE SENATE REPORT SEATED NUMBER

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:07.975
WE USE EIGHT HUNDRED AND THREE

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:08.843
THOUSAND YOU KNOW GOOD BECAUSE

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:09.910
INCLUDES PLUG IN HYBRID

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.846
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THE TIME AND

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.080
SO IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE

01:34:13.147 --> 01:34:14.415
SEMANTICS OF USE THAT NUMBER.

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:15.750
WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO THE ONE

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:18.052
MILLION TARGETS AND IF YOU- IN

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:20.654
A DEAL IN YOUR GROWTH PASSED-

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:21.222
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE EIGHT RUN

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:22.223
TRACK ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.558
MILLION CITY BUT START THERE

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:27.595
MANY OF MY CO PANELISTS BECAUSE

01:34:27.661 --> 01:34:32.199
WHEN TO JUMP AND. I THINK IT'S

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:35.069
AN UNEQUIVOCAL YES- NOT JUST

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:36.904
FROM. THE VEHICLE BEING

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:37.972
DEPLOYED BUT ALSO FROM THE

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.373
VEHICLES BEING MANUFACTURED

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.908
WITH SEVENTY THOUSAND.

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:43.144
EMPLOYEES NOW IN THIS SPACE AND

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.645
WE'RE GROWING AS IMAGES OF

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:46.580
NUMBER ONE EXPORT LAST YEAR. I

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:49.116
THINK WE'RE JUST AT THE- EARLY

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.786
EARLY PHASE OF THIS- SO THE

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:52.920
STATE IS WELL POSITIONED TO

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:54.622
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS IMAGES

01:34:54.688 --> 01:34:57.391
EXAMPLE. NO PROTERRA AND DIVERT

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:58.793
IT MAKING BUSES AND SELLING

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:00.394
THOSE INTO FORTY STATES YOU'RE

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:02.496
SEEING. YOU KNOW. THE STATE'S

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:03.364
YOU WOULDN'T THINK WOULD BE BY

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:05.266
ELECTRIC BUSES ACCEPTOR LINE OF

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.735
TEXAS AND- PLACES LIKE THAT BY

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:09.770
THE END. OF THE BATTERY PACKS A

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:10.838
MAJOR THE BUSES ARE MADE HERE

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:13.274
SO. ALL OF THIS INDIAN WIRE

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:14.308
THOSE COMPANIES HERE ITS

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.077
PROXIMITY TO THE MARKET. IF YOU

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.212
TALK TO CEOS AND I HAVE. THAT

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.680
IS ONE OF THE MAIN KIT TO MAKE

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.382
SO I JUST I THINK THAT

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:22.016
MANUFACTURING IS A PARTICULARLY

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:24.919
EXCITING. THING TO REMEMBER

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:27.755
WHEN ORDERED ECONOMIC RECOVERY-

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:29.857
AND YOU KNOW JUST GENERALLY.

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:32.860
THE WAY THE COSTS COME DOWN-

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.029
FOR TECHNOLOGY. IS REALLY

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.263
SIMPLE BUT IT'S THREE THINGS

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:38.099

FROM. BROUGHT A LOT OF- POINTS

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:40.873
ON REALLY THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.808
WITH A RISK THERE'S A HUGE

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:43.509
DISPARITY ON WHO'S GETTING THAT

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:46.112
THE- THE RESOURCES- WE KNOW

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:47.880

01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:31.477
COMES DOWN AND BECOMES THE SAME

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:33.112
AS A TRADITIONAL CARD IS OF

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.347
COURSE ALREADY CHEAPER TO

01:57:34.414 --> 01:57:35.915
OPERATE ELECTRIC VEHICLE YOU

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:36.816
SAVE ON MAINTENANCE AND OTHER

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.851
COSTS. THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:41.087
INFRASTRUCTURE SPACE RIGHT NOW

01:57:41.154 --> 01:57:43.256
WE'RE SUBSIDIZING AS A STATE IN

01:57:43.322 --> 01:57:44.290
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:46.659
INFRASTRUCTURE IN MULTI FAMILY

01:57:46.726 --> 01:57:49.662
UNITS HARD TO ACCESS MARKET

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.464
SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THE PRIVATE

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.432
SECTOR DOESN'T SEE ENOUGH

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.733
PEOPLE DRIVING ELECTRIC

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.401
VEHICLES TO MAKE THOSE CHARGING

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:58.204
STATIONS PROFITABLE BUT ONCE

01:57:58.271 --> 01:58:00.039
MORE PEOPLE DRIVE THE CARS. WE

01:58:00.106 --> 01:58:02.008
WILL BE ABLE TO STEP BACK AND

01:58:02.074 --> 01:58:03.309
PRIVATE COMPANIES WERE ALREADY

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:04.744
ANXIOUS TO COME INTO THE

01:58:04.811 --> 01:58:06.179
INFRASTRUCTURE REMARKABLE STEP

01:58:06.245 --> 01:58:08.214
IN AND INCREASINGLY THEY'LL B

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:09.849
ABLE TO MAKE A PROFIT GO BE A

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:10.650
BUSINESS CASE FOR THOSE

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:12.885
CHARGES. AS MORE MORE PEOPLE

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:14.220
ADOPT VEHICLES SO YOU'VE HEARD

01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:15.788
THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG THING

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:16.923
WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES MANY

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:18.624
TIMES BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE

01:58:18.691 --> 01:58:19.625
ENVISIONING THINGS WE HAVE TO

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:21.427
GET OVER TO. THE GAP OVER THE

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:23.229
NEXT FIVE TEN OR MORE YEARS BUT

01:58:23.296 --> 01:58:26.766
THEN. THE MARKET WILL BE SELF

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:31.704
SUSTAINING. LAB IS BEEN THAT. I

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:33.105
JUST GOT LOOKED TRYING MEAN

01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:34.740
THAT I THINK THERE OVERLY

01:58:34.807 --> 01:58:36.008
PRICED RIGHT NOW I THINK THERE

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:37.477
RECENTLY PRICE ACTUALLY IF YOU

01:58:37.543 --> 01:58:39.445
START LOOKING AT A COMPARABLE

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:41.914
CARS ON THERE NOT OVER PRICES

01:58:41.981 --> 01:58:43.249
STEP INSTRUCTION THAT'S A

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.184
BARRIER AT LEAST FOR ME- AND

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.786
THE RANGE THAT THAT I WOULD

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:47.887
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW

01:58:47.954 --> 01:58:50.790
COMMUTE. BUT BUT BUT WE'VE I'M

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:51.924
NOT TALK TO THE DEALERS OUT

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.359
THERE WHO'VE BEEN FORCED ME WE

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:54.794
PUT LEGISLATION THROUGH THIS

01:58:54.861 --> 01:58:57.296
FORCE THEM TO HAVE SO MANY CARS

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.931
THAT THEY HAVE TO GET THE DEBT

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:00.366
TO MOVE AND THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:02.301
MOVE AND SO THE DEMAND IDE

01:59:02.368 --> 01:59:03.636
EVEN WITH INCENTIVES AND I

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:09.408
AGREE WITH THE- THE CENTER. OF

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:10.376
MY CASKET IT. WILL IF WE'RE NOT

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:11.143
GONNA INSTEAD OF IT WOULD.

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:11.911
FIGURE WAY OUT TO MAKE SURE

01:59:11.978 --> 01:59:13.713
THAT THE CAN GET A- ON- I THINK

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:15.381
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT AND WE

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:17.283
HAVE TO. SOMEHOW YOU KNOW IT'S

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:19.051
JUST. IT'S MIND BLOWING WHEN I

01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:21.287
SEE. TWENTY NINE AGENCIES THAT

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:22.855
THE FIRST CHART WITH ALL THOSE

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:26.058
ACRONYMS ON THEIR AND- LOGOS.

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:27.727
COORDINATING THIS WHOLE PROCESS

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:30.696
IS. TO ME IS. YOU KNOW I'M I'M

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:32.665
NOT CONFIDENT THAT. THOSE

01:59:32.732 --> 01:59:33.866
AGENCY ALL THOSE AGENCIES

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:36.769
TOGETHER- CAN GET THIS JOB DONE

01:59:36.836 --> 01:59:38.938
AND IF WE DUMPED. BILLIONS IN

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:40.840
THESE PROCESSES AS WELL SO FAR

01:59:40.907 --> 01:59:43.409
SO RIGHT. BUT I ACTUALLY WANT

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:44.577
TO BUY WHEN I LOOKED UP I WILL

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.812

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:03.129
YEARS OUT THAT'S CLOSE TO OUR

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:07.099
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MARK BEFORE.

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:26.926
OF THE OVER THE NEED FOR

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.727
INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE T&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt;

02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:30.429
BOTH THE SEGMENTS OF THE NUMBER

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:32.531
OF CHARGERS TO THEIR OVERALL

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.834
ASSESSMENT AND I THINK AT THE

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:37.970
HIGHER LEVEL GOBIZ KEEPS US ALL

02:04:38.037 --> 02:04:39.104
ON TRACK TO MAKING SURE THAT

02:04:39.171 --> 02:04:44.176
COLLECTIVELY WE ARE MEETING THE

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:46.579
ADMINISTRATION CALLS. YEAH I

02:04:46.645 --> 02:04:48.614
THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK. AND

02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:51.016
SO EACH STATE AGENCY HAS IF IT

02:04:51.083 --> 02:04:52.451
IS NOT DUPLICATIVE IT'S VERY

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:53.786
COMPLEMENTARY THEY WORK HAND IN

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.487
GLOVE TOGETHER ARE ROLLING GO

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:56.789
IS MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUES TO

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:58.257
HAPPEN. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO

02:04:58.324 --> 02:04:59.859
MUCH THEN THAT FRONT REALLY

02:04:59.925 --> 02:05:00.826
EVER BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:02.394
WORKING SO CLOSELY TOGETHER BUT

02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:03.863
IT'S YOU KNOW IF THERE EVER IS

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:05.364
AND THAT DISPUTED WE NOTICED

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.432
SOMETHING IS GOOD HEY THIS IS

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:07.399
ACTUALLY DUPLICATIVE THAT'S

02:05:07.466 --> 02:05:08.734
WHEN WE GO WE TALK WE SORT THAT

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.135
OUT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE-

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:12.071
LEVERAGING OUR RESOURCES MOST.

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.339
EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:13.906
THAT THEREABSOLUTELY

02:05:13.973 --> 02:05:16.442
COMPLEMENTARY ANY THEY WORK

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.543
DECISION THAT COMES OUT OF

02:05:17.610 --> 02:05:19.511
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAS

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:20.713
TAKEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION

02:05:20.779 --> 02:05:23.382
ANALYSIS INTO ACCOUNT. THAT THE

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:24.884
C. SAME THING WITH THE UTILITY

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.352
INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:05:26.418 --> 02:05:29.488
WERE GIVEN THE MARKETS THAT WE

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:30.890
NEED TO. THE MOST. AND IF I

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:33.726
COULD- YOU KNOW AS AN EXAMPLE

02:05:33.792 --> 02:05:37.830
OF- COORDINATION- RECENTLY WE

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:39.498
DID CAN. BE COMPETITIVE

02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:42.001
SOLICITATIONS WHERE HE HE AND

02:05:42.067 --> 02:05:43.502
CARP APPLICATION PROCESS EASIER

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:45.304
STREAMLINED. AND THAT RESULTED

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:47.606
IN FIFTY AND HEARING MISSION

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:48.841
TRADES TRACKS AND

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:52.011
INFRASTRUCTURE- WITH SO THE CDC

02:05:52.077 --> 02:05:53.512
FUNDED THE INFRASTRUCTURE PART

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:54.980
WE FUNDED THE VEHICLE CARE AND

02:05:55.047 --> 02:05:57.783
WE DID IT IN A REALLY

02:05:57.850 --> 02:05:59.718
COORDINATED FASHION. OKAY THANK

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:01.754

CONTINUE TO ADD TO ASK THESE

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:04.556
QUESTIONS AND ENSURE ALL

02:06:04.623 --> 02:06:06.191
COORDINATING EFFECTIVELY BUT I

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.426
APPRECIATE THAT THE ANSWER IS

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:08.994
NONETHELESS. OKAY SO WE'RE

02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:10.129
GONNA I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:11.563
MEMBER QUESTIONS SO WE WILL GO

LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR THE

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.611
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR REALLY IS NOT

02:06:59.678 --> 02:07:01.180
AS WELL UNDERSTOOD FROM

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:06.785
RESEARCHING PUBLICLY. IT

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.821
FEATURES GREATER COMPLEXITY

02:07:08.887 --> 02:07:11.490
WELL CITY OF DATA LACK OF TOOLS

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:16.095
FOR POLICY ANALYSIS INCLUDING.

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:18.097
PROFESSOR RICHIE I THINK YOU

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:22.835

ARE YOU STILL ABLE TO SEE MY

02:07:24.236 --> 02:07:25.971
SLIDES AND GETTING SOON

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:27.773
MESSAGES THAT IT'S QUICK. YES

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.341
YOUR PRESENTATION IS NO LONGER

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:31.910
UP- WE CAN SEE YOU BUT WE CAN

PROCEED- COLLEGE EYES FOR THAT

02:07:37.716 --> 02:07:38.650
I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:41.420
WOULD SOON BUT- SO HEAVY DUTY

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:43.555
VEHICLES ARE RELATIVELY SMALL

02:07:43.622 --> 02:07:46.959
IN NUMBER BUT THERE. THE BIG AN

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:48.594
IMPACT IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:51.730
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:52.798
THOUSAND CLASS EIGHT. TRUCKS

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:55.134
SEES A LARGE THREE AXLE TRACTOR

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.437
IS ALMOST HOLDEN USED DIESEL.

02:07:58.504 --> 02:07:59.471
AND I THINK YOU'RE WELL AWARE

02:07:59.538 --> 02:08:00.606
OF THE DISPROPORTIONATE AIR

02:08:00.672 --> 02:08:02.474
QUALITY IMPACTS OF THESE

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:07.179
VEHICLES- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:08.714
IMPORTANT HEAVY DUTY DIESEL

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:10.716
ATTRIBUTES TO CONSIDER WHEN

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:12.785
DEVELOPING POLICY TO TRANSITION

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:14.853
SERVICE THIS HELPS US TO FIND

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.821
THE VEHICLE TYPES AND

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:17.890
APPLICATIONS THAT ARE TO BE

02:08:17.956 --> 02:08:19.658
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED. THE

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:21.126
FEASIBILITY OBSERVE

02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:22.728
TECHNOLOGIES AND TO BETTER

02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:23.262
UNDERSTAND THE BEFORE AND

02:08:23.328 --> 02:08:26.398
AFTER- IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:28.700
IMPACTS AND SO. THEIR NUMBER OF

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.335
ATTRIBUTES IS INCLUDE THE CLASS

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:31.270
OF THE VEHICLE THAT'S

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:32.471
RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD THE

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:33.772
FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION

02:08:33.839 --> 02:08:35.074
IS A WEIGHT BASED CLASS SYSTEM

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:36.508
WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES INCLUDE

02:08:36.575 --> 02:08:37.676
DIFFERENT CLASSES IN THE

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:41.947
DEFINITIONS OF. WHAT AN HDD IS.

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:43.148
THERE A DIFFERENT VOCATIONS

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.850
THINGS LIKE DRY AGES WITH WITH

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:47.086
HEARD REFUSE SHORT LONG WALL

02:08:47.152 --> 02:08:48.887
AND OFTEN INVOLVES VEHICLES

02:08:48.954 --> 02:08:50.556
WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS.

02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:51.890
THE COMMODITIES OF THESE

02:08:51.957 --> 02:08:54.259
VEHICLES CAREY CAN BE IMPORTANT

02:08:54.326 --> 02:08:55.327
TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEIR

02:08:55.394 --> 02:08:57.729
AGE DISTRIBUTION. IS IMPORTANT

02:08:57.796 --> 02:08:59.098
OLDER VEHICLES TEND TO BE

02:08:59.164 --> 02:09:02.534
HIGHER EMITTING- RECENT WORK

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:07.673
SHOWS. THAT MANY CONSTRUCTION.

02:09:07.739 --> 02:09:09.341
VEHICLES ARE ALL THAN OF WE-

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:11.210
AND THE CONCERT DIRECT IN THE

02:09:11.276 --> 02:09:14.146
AREAS. THE FLEET SIZE IS

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:16.882
IMPORTANT TOO BECAUSE THE OWNER

02:09:16.949 --> 02:09:18.517
OPERATORS AND SMALL FLEETS

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:21.053
MIGHT FOCUS WE THINK ON UP

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:23.789
FRONT PURCHASE PRICES. OF ZIV

02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:26.058
TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN SAY

02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.626
THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP OF

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.061
THE LIFE THE EAGLES SLUDGE

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:31.430
FLEETS MIGHT CALCULATE AND THE

02:09:31.497 --> 02:09:33.232
SMALLER FLEETS MAY FEEL PRICED

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:35.567
OUT OF THE MARKET. ACTIVITY

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:38.137
PATTERNS OF THE VEHICLES ARE

02:09:38.203 --> 02:09:39.805
ALSO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:43.942
EXAMPLE WHETHER THEY RETURNED.

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:44.576
TO BASE AT NIGHT OR EVEN DURING

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:45.744
THE DAY. IT WOULD CASE IT FOR.

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:47.713
ON SITE OR HOME BASE BUSINESS

02:09:47.779 --> 02:09:50.949
ON ROAD CHARGING AND REFUELLING.

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:53.318
AND THE CAR DOORS IN THE

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:54.920
COMMUNITIES IN SWEET KIND OF

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:56.688
HEARD THESE VEHICLES TRAVELS

02:09:56.755 --> 02:09:58.457
THROUGH AND THE RESULTING AIR

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:01.360
QUALITY AND HEALTH IMPACTS CAN

02:10:01.426 --> 02:10:02.528
HAVE IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL

02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:07.733
JUSTICE AND- PUBLICATIONS. SO

02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:09.101
CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT SEVENTY

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:10.135
THOUSAND MILES- INDEPENDENT

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:11.904
OWNER OPERATORS THEY OPERATE

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:13.172
PRIMARILY CLASS AGE WELL IT'S

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:15.140
TRUCKS THEY HAVE A MEDIAN NET

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:17.776
INCOME OF FIFTY THOUSAND

02:10:17.843 --> 02:10:20.345
DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE

02:10:20.412 --> 02:10:22.247
ALSO KNOWN TO RELY HEAVILY ON

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:26.385
SMALL FLEET AN OWNER OPERATOR-

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:28.854
VEHICLES SO HEAVY DUTY SAID

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.222
POLICIES REALLY NEED TO

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:32.291
RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:35.460
ECONOMIC IMPACT. ON SMALL

02:10:35.527 --> 02:10:37.029
FLEET'S WHICH ARE AN IMPORTANT

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.530
WORKFORCE STATEMENT TO AVOID

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.399
POTENTIALLY PRICING THEM OUT OF

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:42.167
THE SECTOR OR CREATING NEW

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:44.369
BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHEN THERE'S

02:10:44.436 --> 02:10:45.904
ALREADY A SHORTAGE OF EVERY

02:10:45.971 --> 02:10:52.277
DUTY AND DRAPES DRIVERS. WELL

02:10:52.344 --> 02:10:55.347
ACTUALLY THE IDEAS OF MINE- WE

02:10:55.414 --> 02:10:57.649
CONDUCTED RECENTLY A SMALL WITH

02:10:57.716 --> 02:10:59.384
VERY DETAILED SURVEY OF TWENTY

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.053
FLEETS FROM SMALL TO LARGE IN

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:03.589
SIZE ACROSS VARIOUS LOCATIONS.

02:11:03.655 --> 02:11:05.424
AND IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS FACTORS

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:07.159
INFLUENCING THE ADOPTION OF.

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:10.596
FUEL HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

02:11:10.662 --> 02:11:11.196
INCLUDING BATTERY ELECTRIC AND

02:11:11.263 --> 02:11:12.431
FUEL CELL. THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:11:12.497 --> 02:11:15.334
SURVEY WAS TO ACT AS A PILOT TO

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.369
DEVELOP A THEORY OF FLEET FUEL

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:19.738
ADOPTION BEHAVIOR AS A

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:20.272
PRECURSOR TO A MUCH LARGER

02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:23.375
SURVEY. WE DOING THIS SUMMER IN

02:11:23.442 --> 02:11:25.177
ORDER TO FORECASTING MODEL IF

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:28.313
YOU DESERVE. ADOPTION THE FACT

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.782
IS THAT EMERGED NOT IN ORDER OF

02:11:30.849 --> 02:11:33.418
IMPORTANCE INCLUDED TECHNOLOGY

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:34.620
CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS THE

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:37.823
AVAILABILITY AND SUITABILITY OF.

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:39.491
AS IN EAGLE IS THE REASON ONE

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:41.193
OF THE AVAILABLE FOR THE

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.694
FUNCTION OF THE SENATE NEEDS.

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.396
OF THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:45.497
WHICH IS PURCHASE PRICE

02:11:45.564 --> 02:11:46.498
OPERATING MAINTENANCE COSTS

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:49.368
RESELL VALUE. THE FUEL CRISIS

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.503
AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE WERE

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:53.005
SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONAL

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.574
CHARACTERISTICS THAT EMERGE ONE

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:58.510
WAS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIOUSNESS

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.812
ONE MIGHT CALL IT. A NUMBER OF

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:02.614
FANS WHO GENERALLY INTERESTED

02:12:02.681 --> 02:12:05.350
IN GREEN TECHNOLOGIES FOR BOTH

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:08.787
SOCIETAL AS WELL AS BUSINESS

02:12:08.854 --> 02:12:11.156
REASONS. SOME FIRMS ALSO

02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:16.061
EXPRESSED A RELUCTANCE TO MOVE

02:12:16.128 --> 02:12:18.163
TO THE NEWER DESERVES HAVING

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:20.132

GAS WAS PARTICULAR CASE IN

02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:28.273
POINT IN THAT MIGHT DELAY THEIR

CONVERSION TO OTHER. GOOGLE'S

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:36.448
THIS WELL. SO LET ME JUST WRAP

02:12:36.515 --> 02:12:38.750
UP IN CONCLUSION I'D LIKE TO

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:41.053

WHICH OF COURSE HELP START

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:05.357
THINGS ARE INCREDIBLY

02:16:05.423 --> 02:16:08.860
IMPORTANT- BUT WANTED TO TALK

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:10.462
ABOUT THIS VERY DIVERSE SEGMENT

02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:12.964
AND SAY THAT. WE CERTAINLY DO

02:16:13.031 --> 02:16:14.566
NOT PREDICT THAT WE WILL NOT

02:16:14.633 --> 02:16:16.234
NEED AND SENATE HAVE TWENTY

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:17.869

HELP START HAVE LAID OUT HERE

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.708
IS THIS THEORY OF CHANGE ABOUT

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.710
WIENER. OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:28.613
DUTY AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. AND

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.949
THAT WE ARE TRANSITIONING IN

02:16:31.016 --> 02:16:32.350
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE WAY

02:16:32.417 --> 02:16:34.486
IN. THE EARLY MOVERS TO THOSE

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:35.020
THAT ARE GOING TO BE MORE

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:40.825
COMPLICATED ON THE RIGHT END.

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:41.426
OF THE SPECTRUM LIKE LONG HAUL

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:42.460
TRUCKS. THAT WOULD THIS IS

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:45.196
REALLY AND WE SEE THAT THERE

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:46.464
WILL BE A NEED FOR ANY KIND OF

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:51.202
FOR A LONG TIME- AND WE ARE

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:52.837
GONNA NEED TO WALK AND CHEW GUM

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:54.306
AT THE SAME TIME TO COMPLETELY

02:16:54.372 --> 02:16:55.740
TRANSFORM THE TRANSPORTATION

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:56.975
SECTOR I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.910
ABOUT EACH OF THESE. FOR THE

02:16:58.977 --> 02:17:00.712
SAKE OF TIME BUT THERE ARE SO

02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:02.547
MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:04.883
THE STATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON-

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:08.887
I'M- YOU KNOW. EQUITY AND WHEN

02:17:08.954 --> 02:17:11.122
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RIGHT

02:17:11.189 --> 02:17:13.224
ROLE OF INCENTIVES- AND

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:14.659
PROVIDING ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH

02:17:14.726 --> 02:17:17.362

AND CLEARING. THE AIR IN THEIR

02:17:19.598 --> 02:17:21.299
COMMUNITIES. BUT I DO WANT TO

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:23.001
FOCUS ON THE LAST ONE WHICH IS

02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:25.804
THAT WE DO IDENTIFY THAT THE

02:17:25.870 --> 02:17:26.538
INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE

02:17:26.605 --> 02:17:28.707
VEHICLE. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:17:28.773 --> 02:17:30.308
COSTS IT'S STILL THE NUMBER ONE

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:32.744
BARRIER. HE THEN ADOPTING A

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:35.080
CULTURE. AND THAT WE REALLY

02:17:35.146 --> 02:17:36.214
THINK THAT WE NEED THE STATE TO

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:41.620
BACK UP YOUR. GOALS AND

02:17:41.686 --> 02:17:55.300
REGULATORY. THIS MS ALEXANDER.

I THINK EVERYTHING IS FINE ON

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:15.687
OUR END. SHE GOT ON OUR END.

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:16.788
OKAY NOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:19.491

SILENT ON THE PHONE FOR HOURS

02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:25.964
AND IT DECIDED TO CUT OUT RIGHT

02:18:26.031 --> 02:18:26.398
IN THE MIDDLE OF MY

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:29.634

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:36.141
WE NEED THE STATE TO BACK UP

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:37.175
OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WITH

02:18:37.242 --> 02:18:45.917
FUNDING. MOST NEEDED IS TO SEND

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:48.253
A SIGNAL TO THE INDUSTRY THAT'S

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:48.820

HEAD SIDE. THAT FUNDING BE OF

02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:56.928
THE AND THEREFORE DEMAND WILL

02:18:56.995 --> 02:18:58.997

TO CONTINUE RAMPING UP THE

02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:12.644
MODELS THAT THEY MAKE AVAILABLE

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:14.312
AND COUNTING ON INCREASED SALES

02:19:14.379 --> 02:19:16.081
VOLUME IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED

GOING TO RAMP UP. OVER THE-

02:20:31.856 --> 02:20:32.791
FIVE TO SIX YEARS. AND THEN THE

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:36.494
OF BEING IN A THIS IS CAL STAR.

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:41.466

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:49.541
TANK WE COULD DECREASE IN AND-

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:52.076
FOR THOSE THE CLASS. IN THE

02:20:52.143 --> 02:20:54.879
PHASE THEM OUT. INSIDERS WILL

02:20:54.946 --> 02:20:56.614
THEN BE A- TO VEHICLE TYPE THAT

02:20:56.681 --> 02:20:58.917

THE STATE AND WE SEE A LOT OF

02:21:22.106 --> 02:21:23.374
SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED

02:21:23.441 --> 02:21:25.844
BUSINESSES IN THIS SPACE I'M

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:26.477
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY UNIQUE

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:29.047
COMPANIES. I THINK THIS IS A

02:21:29.113 --> 02:21:31.516
REALLY POSITIVE MESSAGE SB.

02:21:31.583 --> 02:21:33.384
OVERLOOKS CITED A GREAT JOB

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:35.286
TALKING ABOUT ALL THE AMAZING

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:36.888
BENEFITS WE WILL GET FROM THIS

02:21:36.955 --> 02:21:38.957
TRANSITION. AND WE THINK

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:39.991
CONTINUED JOB GROWTH IN

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:43.461
CALIFORNIA. WILL CERTAINLY BE

02:21:43.528 --> 02:21:45.029
ONE THING. SO REALLY QUICKLY

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:47.398
I'M- NOT GONNA GO THERE

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.766
ACTUALLY. REALLY QUICKLY

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.401
TURNING TO INFRASTRUCTURE FOR A

02:21:50.468 --> 02:21:52.770
MOMENT. WE'VE TALKED A LOT

02:21:52.837 --> 02:21:54.372
ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY-

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:55.506
COMMITTEE ON ALASKA REALLY

02:21:55.573 --> 02:21:57.242
GREAT QUESTIONS I WANTED TO

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:59.477
HIGHLIGHT THAT. THE MEDIUM AND

02:21:59.544 --> 02:22:00.812
HEAVY DUTY INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:04.215
IS REALLY BEHIND LIGHT DUTY.

02:22:04.282 --> 02:22:06.684
I'M CUSTOMERS THAT COSTS FOR

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.219
ESPECIALLY CHARGING FOR HEAVY

02:22:08.286 --> 02:22:09.888
DUTY VEHICLES ARE REALLY

02:22:09.954 --> 02:22:11.723
SIGNIFICANT THEY CAN BE FIFTY

02:22:11.789 --> 02:22:15.693
TO A 100% THE VEHICLE COST. AND

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.228
THE CDC IS COMMITTED OVER THE

02:22:17.295 --> 02:22:19.230
NEXT FEW YEARS TO PUTTING A

02:22:19.297 --> 02:22:20.298
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION INTO

02:22:20.365 --> 02:22:20.765
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:22:20.832 --> 02:22:22.634
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S FROM THE

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:25.036
CUSTOMER SIDE PROGRAMS. AND IF

02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:26.204
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TRAILER

02:22:26.271 --> 02:22:28.640
BILL IS APPROVED THEY'LL PUT IN

02:22:28.706 --> 02:22:30.408
ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION.

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:31.509
WE THINK THIS SENDS A REALLY

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:34.579
STRONG SIGNAL TO THE INDUSTRY-THAT THE STATE WILL BACK THEM

02:22:34.646 --> 02:22:36.514
UP ESPECIALLY FOR EARLY

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:39.183
ADOPTERS. AND WE ARE DEFINITELY

02:22:39.250 --> 02:22:41.286
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA OF

02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:43.988
HAVING A LONG TERM. FUNDING

02:22:44.055 --> 02:22:46.090
SOURCE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WERE

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:48.860
ALSO VERY HAPPY THAT THE QC HAS

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:50.428
AUTHORIZED THE INVESTOR OWNED

02:22:50.495 --> 02:22:52.196
UTILITIES THE POINT I'M

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:54.365
SIGNIFICANT INVESTOR. UTILITY

02:22:54.432 --> 02:22:55.934
FUNDS ONTO THE DISTRIBUTION

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.870
GRID TO PROVIDE THE UPGRADES

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:00.471
NEEDED FOR THESE VEHICLES. BUT

02:23:00.538 --> 02:23:01.940
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT WE THINK

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:04.175
IT'S QUITE IMBALANCED HOW LONG

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:06.077
TERM FUNDING PLAN OR AT LEAST A

02:23:06.144 --> 02:23:08.046
PROPOSAL THAT WE HOPE WILL BE

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:09.614
ADOPTED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:12.083
FUNDING WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING

02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:14.319
LONG TERM PLAN OR EVEN JUST

02:23:14.385 --> 02:23:15.787
THREE YEAR PLAN FOR VEHICLE

02:23:15.853 --> 02:23:16.921
INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR THE

02:23:16.988 --> 02:23:18.990
SECTOR SO. I'LL START WOULD

02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:25.930
LOVE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE ARM.

02:23:25.997 --> 02:23:27.732
TAKE ACTION THERE. YEAH THE

02:23:27.799 --> 02:23:29.000
LAST COUPLE I WAS TO TALK WORK

02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:31.436
FOR. AND WE ARE. SUPPORTIVE OF

02:23:31.502 --> 02:23:33.504
FINDING FINANCING SOLUTIONS FOR

02:23:33.571 --> 02:23:35.807
THE SWEETS ESPECIALLY SMALL AND

02:23:35.873 --> 02:23:36.808
PUBLICLY YOU'RE REALLY GONNA

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:38.910
NEED. WRAPAROUND FUNDING EVEN

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:40.445
IF THEY GET THAT EACH WITHOUT

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:42.413
SURE THEY STILL NEED TO BORROW.

02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:43.548
A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:23:43.614 --> 02:23:45.416
DOLLARS TO BUY ZERO EMISSION

02:23:45.483 --> 02:23:47.352
HEAVY DUTY TRUCK. WE'D LOVE TO

02:23:47.418 --> 02:23:48.987
SEE PROGRAMS LIKE HOW CAP

02:23:49.053 --> 02:23:50.822
EXPANDS SO THAT THEY CAN SERVE

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:51.956
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:54.759
PURCHASERS. AND WORKING WITH

02:23:54.826 --> 02:23:56.594
NRDC WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE

02:23:56.661 --> 02:23:58.096
BUYERS BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE

02:23:58.162 --> 02:23:59.764
THEIR FUTURE SAVINGS AND

02:23:59.831 --> 02:24:03.234
REVENUE STREAMS FOR THOSE LINES.

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:05.903
I'MAND THEN ON. I DID WANT TO

02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.705
SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE THINK

02:24:07.772 --> 02:24:09.907
EVERY CALIFORNIAN DRIVING THEIR

02:24:09.974 --> 02:24:10.875
OWN ELECTRIC VEHICLE ISN'T

02:24:10.942 --> 02:24:13.044
REALLY SHOULDN'T REALLY BE THE

02:24:13.111 --> 02:24:15.446
GOAL- BUT EVERY CALIFORNIAN

02:24:15.513 --> 02:24:17.415
BREATHING CLEAN AIR. AND HAVING

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:20.184
ACCESS TO CONVENIENCE IN ZERO

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:21.819
EMISSION CHOICES FOR MOBILITY.

02:24:21.886 --> 02:24:23.821
AND WHETHER THAT'S A BUSCA BIKE

02:24:23.888 --> 02:24:25.923
WEARING E. V. IS A GREAT CALL.

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:27.392
THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:29.761
APPROACH I AM AND CLEARING THE

02:24:29.827 --> 02:24:31.496
AIR IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:32.497
CONVERTING TRUCK AND BUS

02:24:32.563 --> 02:24:36.300
FLEETS. IS DEFINITELY BRINGING

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:39.570
EQUITY. I'M NOT SURE RAN

02:24:39.637 --> 02:24:40.638
MENTIONED THIS WELL THE NEW

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:42.273
CLEAN UP OFF PROGRAM WITHIN

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.608
IT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:45.410
STATE. CAN SUPPORT PRIORITY

02:24:45.476 --> 02:24:47.979
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT ELEVATES

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:49.881
THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY. AND

02:24:49.947 --> 02:24:51.482
ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE THE LEAD IN

02:24:51.549 --> 02:24:53.284
ADDRESSING THEIR PARTICULAR

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:55.686
LOCAL TRANSPORTATION ISSUES.

02:24:55.753 --> 02:24:57.555
AND FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT WORK

02:24:57.622 --> 02:24:59.991
FOR THEM- SO THESE ARE ALL THE

02:25:00.058 --> 02:25:01.159
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE APPLIED

02:25:01.225 --> 02:25:02.860
FOR FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM

02:25:02.927 --> 02:25:04.062
THERE'S BEEN. REALLY HIGH

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:06.264
DEMANDS WHICH WE THINK IS

02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:08.966
EXTREMELY POSITIVE- THE

02:25:09.033 --> 02:25:10.802
NEGATIVE SIDE OF THAT IS THAT

02:25:10.868 --> 02:25:13.938
ALSO. CMO I'M IN THE SUITE OF

02:25:14.005 --> 02:25:16.274
CARDS EQUITY PROGRAMS USUALLY

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:20.378
GETS. A ONE YEAR APPROPRIATION.

02:25:20.445 --> 02:25:20.978
I THINK LAST YEAR ABOUT A ONE

02:25:21.045 --> 02:25:24.816
TIME APPROPRIATION FROM SAN.

02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:27.051
EARLIER YEAR FUNDS IN SEVERAL

02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:28.486
ALSO YOU'RE ONLY BEING FUNDED

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:30.455
BY G. JURASSIC IS NOT

02:25:30.521 --> 02:25:33.658
NECESSARILY. UNSUSTAINABLE AND

02:25:33.724 --> 02:25:34.892
WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE OTHER

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:37.028
SOURCES OF FUNDING PUT INTO

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:40.198
REALLY CRITICAL CLEAN ABILITY

02:25:40.264 --> 02:25:41.966
PROGRAMS LIKE SAM ALL. BUT

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:44.268
WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. THIS

02:25:44.335 --> 02:25:45.103
YEAR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:47.004
EQUITY AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:49.006
SEE MORE FUNDING INTO EQUITY

02:25:49.073 --> 02:25:51.776
PROGRAMS THAT PROGRAMS LIKE

02:25:51.843 --> 02:25:54.812
THIS CAN EXPAND. I THINK GIVEN

02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:57.081
THE TIME IN THE EVENING I WON'T

02:25:57.148 --> 02:25:58.449

BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIVING

02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:18.409
FURTHER AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS

02:35:18.475 --> 02:35:20.577
THEY'RE SPENDING MORE DOLLARS-

02:35:20.644 --> 02:35:21.912
THERE IN. PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:23.747
INCOME ON TRANSPORTATION SO I

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:24.615
WOULD SAY A COUPLE OF THOSE

02:35:24.682 --> 02:35:27.584
METRICS ARE CRITICAL AND WE ARE

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.520
TRACKING VERY CLOSELY THE

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:30.954
NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION

02:35:31.021 --> 02:35:32.823
VEHICLES AND CHARGERS AND

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.124
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:36.093
ACTUALLY PAYING. AND LOW INCOME

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.028
COMMUNITIES WERE PRETTY MUCH ON

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:39.263
TRACK WITH THE NUMBER OF

02:35:39.329 --> 02:35:42.766
CHARGERS FOR CAPITAL. AND N. H.

02:35:42.833 --> 02:35:45.002
BETTER BY CHAIR RANDALL SHARED

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:46.837
THAT ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:48.305
DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IN

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:49.606
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH

02:35:49.673 --> 02:35:51.041
MEANS THAT THERE ARE CLEANER

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:53.210
VEHICLES ON THOSE ROADS. AND WE

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:55.345
THINK THIS CLEAN VEHICLES MILES

02:35:55.412 --> 02:35:57.281
TRAVELED IS A REALLY CRITICAL

02:35:57.347 --> 02:35:59.149
METRIC I'M IN THE MEDIUM AND

02:35:59.216 --> 02:36:01.585
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. I'M AND THEN

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:02.953
OTHER METRICS WE CAN THINK OF

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.822
IN TERMS OF HOW ARE WE DOING

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:06.457
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED CHEERING I'M

02:36:06.523 --> 02:36:08.192
CONFIDENT CAR WILL DO THIS

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:09.359
TRACK CLOSELY THE NUMBER OF

02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:11.261
DEPLOYMENTS IN EACH VEHICLE

02:36:11.328 --> 02:36:15.632
CLASS. AND HOW ARE THOSE PRICES

02:36:15.699 --> 02:36:17.134
FOR THESE VEHICLES COMING DOWN

02:36:17.201 --> 02:36:18.702
AS WE SAID AS WE HIT THESE

02:36:18.769 --> 02:36:20.437
MILESTONES. AND IT'S NOT JUST

02:36:20.504 --> 02:36:21.472
ABOUT THE INITIAL PURCHASE

02:36:21.538 --> 02:36:23.040
PRICE BUT WE'RE ALL VERY

02:36:23.107 --> 02:36:24.108
FOCUSED ON THE TOTAL COST OF

02:36:24.174 --> 02:36:26.276
OWNERSHIP. AND WHEN ARE WE

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:28.512
GONNA REACH. PARITY WITHIN HER

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:30.614
CLOSE TO BEING THERE. IN SOME

02:36:30.681 --> 02:36:32.950
VEHICLE CLASSES AND YOU KNOW

02:36:33.016 --> 02:36:35.018
BUT WE NEED TO BE CLOUT I AM

02:36:35.085 --> 02:36:36.720
VERY CAREFULLY TRACKING THAT

02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:38.322
METRIC IS THE RUMOR GOING TO

02:36:38.388 --> 02:36:40.891
HIT THOSE CHECKING POINTS. OUT

02:36:40.958 --> 02:36:42.793
SIMON OUR BELL- DOCTOR REACHING

02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:44.962

02:36:45.028 --> 02:36:47.331
QUESTION WELL I WOULD JUST ADD

DOLLY REFERRED TO EARLIER DID

02:36:51.935 --> 02:36:55.205
IDENTIFY THAT. THERE IS MORE

02:36:55.272 --> 02:36:57.341
DATA THAT CARBS SHOULD BE

02:36:57.407 --> 02:36:59.643
COLLECTING AND ANALYZING ABOUT

02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:01.411
THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND WE

02:37:01.478 --> 02:37:02.513
AGREE THAT MORE DATA WOULD BE

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:05.482
HELPFUL. AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T

YOU KNOW VARGAS DOWN SO MUCH AN

02:37:06.683 --> 02:37:08.051

WITH THEIR DIESEL. OR GASOLINE

02:39:53.684 --> 02:39:54.851
COUNTERPARTS AND WE COULD

02:39:54.918 --> 02:39:57.154
START. FOR EXAMPLE PHASING THEM

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:58.088
OUT OF EACH BED YOU KNOW TWO

02:39:58.155 --> 02:40:00.390

THAT IN THE LATTER PART OF THIS

02:40:08.231 --> 02:40:10.000
DECADE WHEN ADVANCE CONTRACTS

COST DOWN AND NOTHING DIFFERENT

02:40:17.007 --> 02:40:18.675
VEHICLE CATEGORIES THAT WE CAN

02:40:18.742 --> 02:40:20.143
PUT THOSE IN FRONT OF DOLLARS

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:21.845
INTO TRUCKS THAT ARE JUST

02:40:21.912 --> 02:40:23.447
COMING TO THE MARKET IN THOSE

02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:25.983
LATER YEARS. I'M AND NOT SWEAR

VOLVO OR DAIMLER WE EXPECT THE

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:14.865
INCREMENTAL COSTS TO BE BETWEEN

02:41:14.931 --> 02:41:17.300

WE KNOW THAT THIS SIGNIFICANT

02:41:30.147 --> 02:41:31.481
COST DIFFERENCES ALSO DUE IN

02:41:31.548 --> 02:41:32.416
