00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.692
WHEN WE CELEBRATE LOVE EVERY

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.561
SINGLE DAY OF THE YEAR. IT'S

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:34.798
BEEN A STRUGGLE AT TIMES- IN

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.400
OUR CITY OUR CITY HAS

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:38.368
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AS PEOPLE

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:41.571
HAVE COME AND GONE. WITHIN OUR

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.573
CITIES COMMUNITY FABRIC. BEFORE

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.476
OUR LGBT COMMUNITY THIS IS BEEN

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.211
AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE I THINK

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:50.414
BACK TO THE TIME WHEN I WAS OUR

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.282
COUNTY'S ASSESSOR RECORDER AND

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.184
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT BEING THE

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.252
PERSON WHO SIGNS MARRIAGE

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.154
LICENSES WOULD EVER BE A

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.455
CONTROVERSIAL THING EVER. IN

00:50:58.522 --> 00:51:01.658
POLITICS. BUT THERE WE WERE AS

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.994
OUR COMMUNITY WAS TRY

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:04.494
STRUGGLING TO FIGHT FOR

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:07.097
MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND OUR CITY

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.698
WAS SO PROUD TO REALLY BE AT

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:12.335
THE FOREFRONT. OF THAT EFFORT

00:51:12.402 --> 00:51:14.204
TO FOCUS AND TO TALK ABOUT

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.440
FAMILIES WANTED TO BECOME

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:19.776
UNITED. AND I REMEMBER. I HAD

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.344
THE HUGE HONOR OF MARYLAND ONE

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:24.314
COUPLE WHEN. GAY MARRIAGE FIRST

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:27.551
BECAME LEGAL AND IT WAS A

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:29.653
CAUCASIAN MALE AN ASIAN AND

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:31.621
ASIAN MALE WHO I MARRIED IN MY

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:34.458
OFFICE. AND I REMEMBER HIS

00:51:34.524 --> 00:51:36.927
CHINESE MOTHER COMING UP TO ME

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:39.563
AFTERWARDS. AND SAY THANK YOU

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:42.265
SO MUCH FOR MAKING OUR FAMILY

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:46.102
HOLE. IT WASN'T THAT. THE MOM

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:48.371
DID NOT THINK OF HER FAMILY'S

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.307
WHOLE. IT WAS SOCIETY'S

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:53.910
PROBLEMS HE WAS OUR PROBLEM

00:51:53.977 --> 00:51:55.045
THAT WE HAD ALWAYS MADE THIS AN

00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:58.648
ISSUE THEY HAVE LONG ACCEPTED

00:51:58.715 --> 00:51:59.216
THIS FAMILY AS PART OF THEIR

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:03.153
FAMILY. BUT REMOVING THIS FINAL

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.323
PART OF STIGMA REMOVING THIS

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:10.360
LEGAL BARRIER SOMETHING THAT

00:52:10.427 --> 00:52:13.663
WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HER THIS

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:14.231
THIS OLDER IMMIGRANT CHINESE

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:17.767
WOMAN. AND SO I THINK ABOUT ALL

00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:22.639
THE OTHER APR IS WHO ARE LGBTQ.

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:25.141
AND THEIR STRUGGLE AS THEY HAD

00:52:25.208 --> 00:52:26.977
TO COME OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:29.779
AND HOW DO. DEAL WITH THAT

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:33.016
PARTICULAR ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:33.850
THAT I KNOW OUR COMMUNITY HAS

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:37.754
REALLY. GROWN ON IT HAS REALLY

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.023
EVOLVED ON I REMEMBER WHEN WE

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.259
WERE TOUGH FIGHTING- THE

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.827
NONPROFIT CAMPAIGN AND TALKING

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.962
ABOUT. HOW WE COULD MESSAGE

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.831
THIS ISSUE IN OUR PARTICULAR

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:51.434
API COMMUNE. IT TO ME IT ALWAYS

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:51.968
CAME BACK TO THE FOCUS ON

00:52:52.035 --> 00:52:55.171
FAMILY. BECAUSE FAMILY IS SUCH

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:56.706
A CENTRAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.441
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.976
AND FOR US THIS IS REALLY

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:02.279
ABOUT. FAMILIES BEING ABLE TO

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.214
COME TOGETHER. BE ABLE TO LIVE

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:05.515
TOGETHER AND TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:09.386
CHOOSE WHO THEY LOVE. TOGETHER

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.587
AND ULTIMATELY WAS THE WINNING

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.522
MESSAGE AND IF YOU LOOK AT

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.624
WHERE OUR COMMUNITY HAS COME

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:15.258
EVEN IN THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:18.228
YEARS. IT'S REALLY MIRRORS THE

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.230
REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT IN MANY

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:23.166
WAYS IT MIRRORS THAT EXACT

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:23.934
THOUGHT PROCESS ONCE THEY

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.002
REALIZED. THAT THIS WAS ABOUT

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.071
PROTECTING THEIR FAMILY ABOUT

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.205
CHOICE FOR THEIR FAMILY IT IS

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.308
ABOUT. LOVE LOVING THEIR

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.977
FAMILY. ALL THE OTHER ISSUES

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.845
DIDN'T SEEM VERY IMPORTANT. AND

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:38.415
SO FOR THAT I RISE AND ASK ALL

COMING KANSEI BEER THE FIGHT I

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.036
REMEMBER EVEN. YES ONLY THIS IS

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:48.103
SOMETHING THAT MEMBERS HAVE

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.371
ASKING FOR LIKE WHEN DID I COME

A COMING OUT THE I JUST KIND OF

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:54.043
EXISTED IN THAT KIND OF ROME I

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:54.977
THINK THAT IS GOING TO BECOME

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.146
MORE OF A TREND AND MORE OF THE

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:59.014
MORE OF THE- WAY THINGS ARE

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:00.716
DONE IN IN THE FUTURE. I

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.184

GROW GROW MORE. I JUST REMEMBER

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:09.658

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:11.493
THAT MOST LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE NOW

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.962
IS. THE MOMENT YOU KNOW THAT

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.931
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.066
WE DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.667
BASED ON THE NORMS OF THE DAY

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.169
IS WHEN YOU START HAVING THAT

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.171
SENSE OF IN CLING THAT'S- YOU

WITH. A WOMAN AT THE TIME SO

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:32.381
IT'S VERY INTERESTING SO EVEN

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.982
OTHER PEOPLE TO TELL OF AND

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:35.284
THIS IS AN INTERESTING TIMES

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.618
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IT WAS

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.153
AND ALSO IT'S GREAT I WAS AND

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:38.887
THERE WAS A PROP EIGHT DAYS AND

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.456
THAT JUST PASSED AND THAT WAS

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.357
REALLY FORMING. THE IDENTITY OF

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:44.326
WHEN YOU KNOW OUR OUR STATE HAD

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.195
JUST HAD A REFERENDUM SAYING IS

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:48.063
GAMERS OKAY OR NOT AND IN

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.198
HINDSIGHT YOU THINK ABOUT TO

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.566
GET THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW I

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.101
THINK THE GREAT STRIDES MADE

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:52.768
EDUCATION AS I REMEMBER USED TO

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:55.304
BE- ALMOST FASHIONABLE TO SAY

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.205
SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE IS

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:58.340
GAY. I THINKING BACK ON IT LIKE

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.208
YOU KNOW DECADES OF FOUR I

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:00.642

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.145

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:05.981
LITTLE BIT BUT I THINK IT'S

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.349
JUST IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.617
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:09.451
EXPRESS THEMSELVES SO THEY'RE

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.253
DIFFERENTLY AND IT'S SO

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.454
IMPORTANT THAT WE RESPECT THAT

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.555
HOW THEY EXPRESS THEIR GENDER

01:13:13.622 --> 01:13:15.190
ACCESS TO HOW THEY LOVE. AND

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.559
