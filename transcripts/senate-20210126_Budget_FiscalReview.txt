BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR AB THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT WHICH INCLUDED EVICTION PROTECTIONS THEY SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH. AND AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE ARE IN CALIFORNIA STILL ONE POINT FOUR MILLION WORKERS WHO REMAIN UNEMPLOYED. ADDITIONALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN PASSING CARES ACT TO PROVIDED TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE- BOTH TO THE STATE TO DISTRIBUTE AND SOME DIRECTLY TO OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND THESE THE- ISSUES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING TODAY. WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO. MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND ADDITIONALLY ADDRESS THE FACT THAT OUR CURRENT BILL WITH THE FICTION MORATORIUM IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

RIGHT I'M GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SKINNER AYE STERN NIELSEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DIRECTLY WITH THE EPARTMENT OF FINANCE- TODAY I WILL BE PRESENTING ON SB SEVENTY NINE AND- A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR WHICH AMENDS THE CURRENT BUDGET AND SB NINETY ONE A TRAILER BILL WHICH EXTENDS THE STATE'S EVICTION MORATORIUM AND CREATE THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE FEDERAL RENTAL AND LANDLORD REALLY FUN- THE STARTING. WITH SB EIGHTY NINE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR- SB EIGHTY NINE AS TO TECHNICAL ITEMS TO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OR ABCD. UNNECESSARY IF ORTIZ AND FLEXIBILITIES TO IMPLEMENT AND ADMINISTER THE FEDERAL FUNDS ALLOCATED TO CALIFORNIA UNDER THE RECENT FEDERAL COULD ONLY FILL. CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THESE TECHNICAL BUDGET ITEMS AUTHORIZED HDD TO TRANSFER AND USE UP 210% OF THE FUNDS PROVIDED. ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. AND MOVING ON TO THE TRAILER BILL SB NINETY ONE INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT EXTEND THE STATE'S EVICTION MORATORIUM AND ESTABLISH THE STATE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND CHARITY NOTED- CORRECT RELEVANT BACKGROUND THAT PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN LOSSES OF INCOME NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CALIFORNIANS. RENTERS AND HOMEOWNERS- WELL DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AND EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND HELP THEM INDIVIDUAL PAY RENTS MANY TENANTS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR PAYMENTS. OCCURRING LARGE AMOUNTS OF RENTAL ARREARS AND MANY LANDLORDS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS TENANTS ARREARS OUT UP. LATE AUGUST IN RESPONSE THIS. PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH INCLUDED THE NATION'S STRONGEST STATEWIDE EVICTION PROTECTION- AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT HAS PREVENTED MANY CALIFORNIANS FROM EXPERIENCING ADDICTION BUT THE PRIMARY PROVISIONS OF THE FLY EXPIRE. ON JANUARY THIRTY FIRST- HE SAID GOING ON- AND I'M SPEND AT APOLOGIES FOR THAT THE BILL MEMBERS ANYWHERE NOW THESE ARE EIGHTY SEVENTY NINE AND EIGHTY EIGHTY- THE BILL EXTENDS THE STATE'S CURRENT EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR TENANTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY RENT YOU TO COPE AND RELATED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FIVE FIVE NINE SO FROM JANUARY THE END OF THIS MONTH UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH. OF THIS YEAR. SENATE CONTINUE TO PAY 25% OF THEIR RENTAL OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED UNDER AB THIRTY EIGHT. THROUGH JUNE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE DURING THIS TIME IF TENANTS CONTINUE TO PAY AT LEAST THE AMOUNT THEY'RE PROTECTED FROM ADDICTION FOR ANY UNPAID RENTS THAT HAS ACCUMULATED. DURING THIS COVERAGE PERIOD. THE BILL ALSO- EXTENDS EIGHTY THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTY EIGHT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS RELATED TO MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE. IT ALSO EXTENDS THE PROHIBITION ON COMMENCING AN ACTION IS SMALL THINGS COURTS RECOVERED- BUT NINETEEN RENTAL THAT- TO AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE GOING INTO THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM- IN THE BILL ESTABLISHES THIS PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE THE RELIEF FINDS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- DESIGNATED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE. CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT SIX BILLION OF WHICH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WILL COME STRAIGHT TO THE STATES. AND ONE POINT ONE BILLION IS ALLOCATED DIRECTLY BY THE US TREASURY TO COUNTIES AND CITIES WITH POPULATIONS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND- THE PROGRAM STRUCTURED THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE ELIGIBLE LANDLORDS WITH IMMEDIATE RELIEF THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF 80% OF THEIR TENANTS. RENTAL ARREARS ACCUMULATED FROM APRIL APRIL OF LAST YEAR THROUGH MARCH OF THIS YEAR. IN RETURN LANDLORDS RECEIVE THAT THE MEDIA FINANCIAL RELIEF AGREED ACCEPTED AS PAYMENT IN FULL SO FOR GIVING THE ROOM REMAINING RENTAL THAT. OF THEIR TENANTS DURING THIS GIVEN TIME. HCD WILL ADMINISTER THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDS RECEIVED BY THE STATE THROUGH EITHER A BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATION TO LOOK LOOK HOLIDAYS OR THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR. LARGER COUNTIES AND CITIES MAY RECEIVE A DIRECT BLOCK GRANT- ALLOCATION FROM THE STATE TO SUPPLEMENTTHEIR DIRECT ALLOCATIONS FROM THE U. S. TREASURY- WHILE FUNDING FOR SMALLER COUNTIES WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- OR IMPLEMENTOR. COUNTIES OR CITIES THAT PREFER NOT TO ADMINISTER A LOCAL PROGRAM CAN REQUEST THAT THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL ALLOCATION FUNDS BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH. THE STATE PROGRAM. FOR CONSISTENT TREATMENT THOUGH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE COUNTIES OR CITIES THAT SUPPLEMENT THEIR ALLOCATIONS WITH THE STATE BLOCK GRANTS- THEY WILL FOLLOW THE SAME STATE RENTAL PROGRAM PROVISIONS THAT WERE DESCRIBED ABOVE. AND THAT'S TO CREATE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE. NOW REGARDING ALLOCATION STATE FUNDING WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF POPULATION- HOWEVER THERE IS A SMALL COUNTY KERR ABOUT SO THE SMALLER COUNTIES THAT HAVE POPULATIONS OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR LESS. WILL RECEIVE A PORTION OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION LARGE JURISDICTIONS WITH POPULATIONS ABOVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND WILL RECEIVE FUNDS BASED ON A PERCENT OF TOTAL POPULATION. BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS MAY APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM- FOR ASSISTANCE THE FEDERAL PROGRAM DOES EMPHASIZE LANDLORD PARTICIPATION IN CASES WHERE LANDLORDS CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE THEY STILL CANNOT GET BACK TO YOU MAKES TENANTS FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT. OF RENT SO LONG AS THEIR TENANT IS PAYING 25% OF RENT- JUST THROUGH THE END OF THIS COVERED. THROUGH THROUGH THE END OF JUNE. IN THESE CASES AN ELIGIBLE TENANT MAY APPLY TO THE PROGRAM ON BEHALF OF THEIR LANDLORD. AND THEY MAY APPLY FOR UP 225% OF THEIR ARREARS- BUT THEY'VE BEEN MUST USE THOSE THAT 25% TO PAVE POPULAR MONTHLY RENTS- IN REGARDS TO TIMING RECOGNIZING BOTH THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A STRICT. FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPLOYING THE FUNDS. HCD WILL ALLOCATE THE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS IMMEDIATELY AFTER JURISDICTIONS OPT INTO THE PROGRAM. AND CONTRACTS ARE EXECUTED GRANTEES MUST THEN OBLIGATELY 65% OF THEIR STATE FUNDING. BY JUNE OF THIS YEAR- WITH ALL OF THE FUNDS BEING EXPENDED BY AUGUST AND THE REASON FOR THESE DATES IS REALLY TO ADHERE TO FEDERAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. WHICH MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. HOWEVER ANY GRANTEE THAT DOES NOT USE OR DOES NOT OBLIGATE AT LEAST 65% OF THEIR FUNDS. BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEM. BASICALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE IT BACK- AND SO WORTH NOTING IN CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO OBLIGATE. AT LEAST 65% OF THE DIRECT APPLICATION THAT WE RECEIVE. THEN WE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL FEDERAL ALLOCATED- REALLOCATED FUNDS- TO ENSURE PROGRAM INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROGRAM FUNDS PROVIDED TO GRANTEES WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME RECORDING AND VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. AS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IN ADDITION HDD MAY REQUEST ADDITIONAL REPORTING TO ENSURE PROGRAM FUNDS ARE BEING USED- APPROPRIATELY- AND IMPORTANT TO KNOW H. CD WILL ALSO BE REPORTING MONTHLY TO THAT- JOINT. LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM- IN REGARDS TO PERFORMANCE METRICS- FOR THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM AND THE AND THE BLOCK GRANTED FUNDS. SO INCLUDING THE INTENT OF THE PROGRAM IS TO REALLY MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BE RECEIVING. HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND TO SET UP A- A DESIGN PROGRAM- THANK IT CAN GET THE MONEY OUT EFFICIENTLY EQUITABLY AND WITH ACCOUNTABILITY IN REGARDS TO THE REPORTING- SO INCLUDING ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY- THANK YOU AND THAT SENIOR STAFF FROM THE- BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. OR HEARING DATE- THERE ON- PARTICIPATING ON THE LINE. AND THEY- HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM SO WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS. WITHIN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WONDER IF WE SHOULD PRESENT ON THE SECOND. BILL SINCE THEY ARE- INTER INTEGRAL TO EACH OTHER IF AND THEN START OUR DISCUSSION PORTION. LOOKS GOOD OKAY SO LET'S HEAR THE PRESENTATION ON AB AT AND THEN WE WILL- SEE IF THERE'S QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR AND FROM COMMITTEE- APOLOGIES- THERE MAY BE ONE ISSUE. FOR A DO THAT. VOTE FIFTIES MAY I JUST WASN'T- I DIDN'T TRACK THAT YOU WERE THAT YOU HAD SAID EIGHTY EIGHT YOU DID BOTH SEVENTY NINE EIGHTY ALL RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT- BOTH AMONG BEFORE US ONE BEING THE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AND ONE BEING THE TRAILER BILL SO WE NOW CAN SEE WHAT. THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS THERE ARE I HAVE A FEW BUT LET ME SEE WHAT'S FROM THE- FLOOR BEFORE BEGIN MINE- SENATOR DORADO THE SENATE OR WHITE HOUSE SKI. OKAY LET ME GET- SENATOR NEWMAN SO LET'S START WITH SENATOR DRAWS SO AND THEN I WILL START A LIST WITH THE OTHERS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- OKAY FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE- WHEN THEY CALLED THE THIRD PARTY THAT'S GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN- A CARRYING THIS OUT- THERE'S SOME INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US. IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE SO FRANKLY SO THAT WE COULD LEARN FROM THE PROCESS AND- KNOLL WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND TRACKING THAT INFORMATION COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THEY WOULD INFORMATION THEY WOULD GATHER. YES SENATOR RAZA I'M GONNA HAVE THAT QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE- AT THE AGENCY THANK YOU. SENATOR HI THIS IS LINDA ON COKE LIEBHARD AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND SO THE- THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR PRIMARILY WILL BE COLLECTING ALL THE INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED TO VERIFY ELIGIBILITY. WITHIN THE APPLICATION SUBMITTED EITHER FOR LANDLORDS OR TENANTS I'M SO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM OUTLINES A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE. THE RECORDING ON THE USE OF THE APPLICATIONS. SO WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO US I DON'T I DON'T MEAN PRIVATE- INFORMATION BUT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO US AS- LEGISLATORS. THAT WE COULD USE TO. UNDERSTAND THE SUCCESS OR THE FLAWS OR WHATEVER IT. IS YOU KNOW WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO US TO KNOW. YES OF THE INFORMATIONAL BE CORRECT COLLECTED INCLUDES- BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO AND WHERE THE WHERE THE HOUSEHOLD IS LOCATED AND THEN- INFORMATION THE BILL WILL PROVIDE I. D. THAT'S REQUIRED OR THAT THEY WILL- INCLUDED AS AN OPTIONAL HE'S BEEN FORMATION ABOUT- THEIR HOUSEHOLD. AND IN THIS AND ALSO INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE APPLICATIONS SO WE WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHO FINANCED THEIR SUCCESS RATE ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE. I DO WITH THE GRANT AND THEN VALUE OF THE GRANTS THE TERMS OF THE GRANT. AND DO YOU- THEIR WAY OF KNOWING THAT WE COULD GET THAT ARE GETTING THAT INFORMATION NOT UNTIL. WENT WITH THE DATES- UNTIL LATER IN THE SUMMER BUT CAN WE GET IT IN SORT OF IN REAL TIME AS CLOSE TO REAL TIME IF POSSIBLE. YES SENATOR I BELIEVE IN THE IN THE BILL LANGUAGE THERE'S A MONTHLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WE'RE THROUGH OUR OUR ENTITIES THROUGH BCS AGING EACH CITY WILL BE PROVIDING A MONTHLY REPORT. OKAY FOR THE MONEY THAT'S GOING STRAIGHT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THE DO THE STATE RULES APPLY TO THEM AS WELL OR IS IT ONLY THE FUNDING THAT WE THAT COMES TO US FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY WILL GO OUT- TO THE JURISDICTIONS. AND OVER THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THE SAME RULES. FORTY FOUR CAN THE LOCAL AREAS ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN RULES ON DISTRIBUTING THE FOR THE ASSISTANCE THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY GET STRAIGHT FROM THE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YES SENATORS IT FOR- PRIMARILY ALL FUNDS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH STILL WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPORT WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN- FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT ELECT TO. TO MINISTER THOSE FUNDS AND THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A STATION OF QUESTION OF THE STATE FUNDING THEN THEY WILL NEED TO LOOK FOR ALSO WHAT THE STATE PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU- WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO- ALLOW THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF A OF A RENTAL RELIEF TO THE BACKGROUND WHAT OTHER BARRIERS TO ALLOW THAT SAME PERCENTAGE WHETHER OR NOT A LANDLORD PARTICIPATES. I CAN ONLY TAKE A SMALL. YEAH THE PRIMARY- STRUCTURE THERE IS REALLY CONVENTION INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION WITH THE LANDLORDS AND THE BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDES HIGHER VALUES THE LANDLORD LEVEL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE A REQUIRE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE THE GRANT BUT THE LANDLORDS AND WE CAN HAVE THE- THE DECISIONAL ARREARS WAIVED AND- REDUCE THE DEBT BURDEN THAT HOUSEHOLDS CARING. IF THE LANDLORD IS NOT WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM AND THE MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE TENANT AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO REMOVE THE ADDITIONAL- DEBTS THAT THE HOUSEHOLD WAS TEARING THEM SO THE RATIOS ARE DESIGNED THAT WAY TO INCENT LANDMARK PARTICIPATION SO THAT WE CAN. GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND HAVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAT HOUSEHOLDS ARE CARRYING OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN- WHAT THE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS AVAILABLE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO RENTERS AS FAR AS PROTECTING THEM FROM RACIAL OR ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION LET'S SAY LANDLORDS USES THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH JUST CERTAIN KINDS OF TENANTS AND NOT OTHER KINDS OF TENANTS WHAT WHAT OPTIONS ARE PROTECTIONS. TO THOSE FOR OUR TENANTS HAVE. YOU MIGHT COULD YOU TAKE A FINANCE MARKET TAKE THAT OR OKAY SURE TERM HAPPY TO TAKE THAT. I AM SENATOR ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE- THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SETS THE SENSUALLY THE SAME STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE FOR- AT HOUSING SOURCES OF FUNDING SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A- NEW REGULATIONS AROUND SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS WHERE. YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING- THIS LANGUAGE INCLUDES THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT THAT THE LANDMARK COULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE SOURCES USING THOSE THAT. THAT THAT THESE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE. RENT ON BEHALF OF THE TIME. OKAY DRAWS AS THE I DO WANT TO ALSO ADD. IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE DO HAVE TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO DEAL WITH SUCH THINGS SUCH AS THIS SO- ONE OF WITHOUT. OKAY GREAT YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO IT- I SPECIALLY OF SUPPORT THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND THE MORATORIUM ON ON THE VACATIONS- OBVIOUSLY. IT'S NOT PERFECT THERE'S SO MANY ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WHEN WE'RE FACING THE TSUNAMI IT IT IT REALLY OF EVICTIONS IT'S REALLY URGENT TO- A SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MOVE FORWARD WITH ACTUALLY WITH BOTH OF THEM. OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE HOLES IN THE PROBLEMS I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK REAL HARD FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS TO ADDRESS THOSE AND USE AS MUCH OF THE EXPERIENCE AND THE- INFORMATION IS POSSIBLE TO DO IT- NOT. WAIT AFTER TILL AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH BUT ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT- TO GET THE INFORMATION SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH VENTURE. THANK YOU SENATOR DRAWS SO I HAVE ON THE LIST NOW SENATOR Y. CASKEY SENATOR NEWMAN SENATOR CORTESE SENATOR MELENDEZ. THEN WE SEE IF THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE OKAY CENTER MCGUIRE. ALRIGHT LET'S PERCENT INTERMITTENT CENTER MINIMALLY. APOLOGIES OF SENTIMENT BUT IN GENERAL. ALL THESE. CENTER IS RAISING CATTLE WITHIN YOUR HAND UP FEATURE ON THE- SO YOU STAND A FUTURE OKAY OF THE WILL- CODE CENTER WORKOUTS SKI RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU FINANCE SO THE LANDLORDS PARTICIPATION IS LIMITED 280% OF THE RENTS THE REAR OF THE CUMULATED FROM APRIL TO MARCH FIRST SO LET'S SAY. THE FIRST LANDLORDS BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY LANDLORD NOT TAKING THIS DEAL BUT LET'S SAY THE LANDLORD TAKES TO DEAL AND THEY GET THE CHECK 480% OF. WHATEVER BALANCES SO THE DEBTOR THE ATTENDANT HAS PAID THE 25% TO. AS STATED IN STATE LAW FOR NOW APRIL FIRST COMES AROUND. AND THE- TO TEN IT PAYS 25% OF THEIR- RENT. AND UNDER THE OF MY UNDERSTANDING LAW THEY CAN'T BE AFFECTED. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE LANDLORD FOR APRIL MAY AND JUNE UNTIL THIS BY THIS MORATORIUMS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT OTHER 75% DO I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE RESPONSE FROM THE AGENCY THANK YOU. SURE THIS IS. YEAH AT THE TIME IN. AND IT. THIS AMY WILSON- FROM THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES A HOUSING AGENCY GOOD AFTERNOON- YES AS YOU CORRECTLY POINT OUT- OF THE- WAY THAT IT'S MORE TIME EXTENSIONS WRITTEN THAT I'M MOVING FORWARD- RENTERS NEED TO- A THE 25% TO. AT YEAH I TOLD THEIR- PUBLICATION UNTIL LANDLORDS AND PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM EVICTION- AND AS YOU ALSO STATE- ANY BALANCE WILL ACCRUE- AS DEAD AS IT HAS PREVIOUSLY- OUR HOPE IS THAT. THE FUNDS WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND- AS WE ARE ADVOCATES- D. CURRENT RENTAL ARREARS THAT. EXISTS RIGHT NOW FOR THE PRIOR PERIOD THAT WILL BE ABLE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION MOVING FORWARD. I GUESS MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION ARE THERE LIMITATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT- FOLLOW UP A REAR EACH PAYMENT. OR WITH THAT. REQUIRE THIS BODY ON ITS OWN TO PUT IN OUR SEPARATE STATE FUNDS IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE THAT JUST THAT LITTLE. THREE MONTH PROBLEM- THERE ARE- THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- DOES- WETRULY EMPHASIZE THE EXISTING RENTAL ARREARS- OVER PERSPECTIVE- PAYMENTS FOR RENT AND SO- THAT'S- BECOME THE FOCUS OF OUR PROGRAM PROGRAM AS WELL- SO THE PERSPECTIVE PAYMENTS- ARE LIMITED TO ARM CERTAIN IN INCREMENTS OF TIME- BUT- AS YOU STATED RIGHT NOW THE FUNDING IS- IS REALLY. AREN'T LOOKING BACKWARDS AND NOT MOVING FORWARDS AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL BE- ADDITIONAL FUNDS FLOWING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL. MAKE THE FORWARD GOING PAYMENTS AVAILABLE THERE ARE NO- THERE ARE NO BARRIERS IN- THIS CURRENT BILL I RELATED TO A PROSPECTIVE PAYMENTS- EXCEPT FOR THE THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL. CIRCUIT MANAGER IF I IF I MAY I. HEARD DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS SAID PRECEDED THIS THE SUNDAY DEAL THAT THERE WAS THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR LEGAL AID ASSISTANCE THING THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE LANDLORD HAS TO HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT THEY FORGIVE AND THERE MAY BE PEOPLE THAT FORGET THAT THEY- FORGIVE THAT TWENTY PERCENT. IS THAT STILL THE ADMINISTRATION'S FINANCE INTENTION THAT THERE'S THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO GO INTO. HELP OUT LEGAL AID IN THE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA NEED HELP. FIVE HUNDRED THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THERE IT STILL REMAINS THIRTY ONE MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE- NATIONAL MORTGAGE- FILAMENT ONE RIGHT NOW I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE WE MADE THAT DECISION IN JUNE WILL WE THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS ONLY SO BIG. AND THE PROBLEM GOT MUCH BIGGER IN THIS IS RATHER COMPLICATED AND I'M WONDERING IF IT WHY THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR LEGAL AID TO DEAL WITH. THIS COMPLICATED. SITUATION AND THEN ALSO COME JULY FIRST WHEN PEOPLE MAY BE ACTUALLY NOT PROTECTED BY THIS BILL IF WE DON'T TO ANOTHER BILL. WHAT'S THE FINANCES THINKING ON THAT. CHAR AND THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WENT TO COLLEGE OF FAITH THAT MAY ALSO BE USED TOWARDS LEGAL ASSISTANCE- SO THERE IS ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IT- ON TOP OF THE THIRTY ONE MILLION- AND THAT IS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET AS WELL. AND IS THAT MONEY GOING OUT THE DOOR FOR LEGAL AID OUR COMMUNITY THAT. IS GOING TO BE. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES SAID DEALING WITH THE TSUNAMI. COMES UP. IS THAT MONEY ARE ABOUT THE TIMING ON THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU I BELIEVE- THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS MORE RECENTLY BEEN- STOOD UP FOR US. BEGUN IN SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THE NUMBER OF FUNDS- BUT YES IT IS IT'S- IT'S AND IT'S AN EXISTING PROGRAM. YEAH I AM WELL WERE MADAM CHARGES. IN THE TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I'VE BEEN FIGHTING WITH FINANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE MONEY GOES TO LEGAL AID. AND I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP THE FIGHT I'M JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEND THE CHECK OUT TO THE COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS REPRESENTATION WITH THAT. HIGHER YIELD. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE- YES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE. INFORMATION THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT- THAT MONEY HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED THE MONEY THAT WAS ALREADY APPROPRIATED. TO LEGAL AID. UPDATE US ON WHETHER IT'S BEEN. DISTRIBUTED RIGHT LET'S HEAR FROM SENATOR NEWMAN FOLLOWED BY SENATOR CORTESE SENATOR MELENDEZ THEN SENATOR MEN AND SENATOR MCGUIRE GO AHEAD ALL RIGHT WITH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BILL PROVIDES UP 280% IS IT UP 280% OR IS IT EIGHTY PERCENT. YEAH I'D- FOR. RENDERERS HI AT 80% SO IT'S A FIX 30% BUT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE APPORTIONED AGAINST A FINITE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS CORRECT. YEAH THAT IS BASED ON THAT- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY GETTING. CHAU DO WE HAVE SOME ASSURANCE. THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE REAR EDGE ACROSS THE STATE. AND WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TRANSACTION- B. THE- I BELIEVE FINANCE WOULD SAY THAT THE ARREARS- THERE'S NO WAY AT THIS POINT TO REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THOSE ARREARS ARE- POTENTIALLY THEY COULD BE AT A CELLULAR STATED BEFORE HUNDRED MILLION- MAYBE EVEN NEED WE THINK THAT'S IN THE LOWER END COULD BE HIGHER- AND SO THIS IS A FINITE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WILL GO BASED ON THE ROUNDS HAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM- AND AGAIN WE WILL WE ARE CONTINUING CONTINUALLY AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM AGENCY SIDE. I'M LOOKING FOR- ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ANY IF IT'S IF IT'S A FIXED PAYMENT OF 80% AND THAT IS A CLEAR AS A VERY OF ITS IT IT'LL BASICALLY FIRST COME FIRST SERVE WILL WILL WILL TO DISPATCH DISPERSES MONEY UNTIL SUCH TIME. AS WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE FUNDS- WELL THAT IT IS A AT FINITE AMOUNT OF A DOLLAR TO PER ITSELF THE SET UP TO. GO OUT AND BROWN'S SO THE FIRST ROUND WOULD REALLY BE- HITTING THE NEEDIEST- HOUSEHOLDS SO THOSE UNDER 50% AREA MEDIAN INCOME- AND THE SECOND ROUND WOULD EXPAND THAT. A BIT AND THE THIRD ROUND AS WELL BUT JUST WANTING TO KNOW-THAT THE IDEA IS TO BE EQUITABLE IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION. BUT ALSO TO HIT WHERE THE NEED IS MOST. AND THAT IS WHAT WILL GO OUT IN ROUND ONE OF THIS PROGRAM I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCY HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. I'M SURE I CAN TRAIN IN- THIS AMY WILSON AGAIN- FROM AGENCY. A GOOD AFTERNOON US SENATOR- I WANTED TO JUST ADD OR EMPHASIZE- THAT- THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO- START FIRST WITH ELIGIBILITY- AND- THEN- MOVE FORWARD IN AT DIFFERENT LAYERS OF PRIORITIZATION AS ERICA DESCRIBED. WITH THE ROUNDS- AND- WE ARE TRYING TO AVOID A SITUATION OF FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT- NOT ALWAYS YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES IT TAKES SOME TIME TO REACH DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- AND- THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT- THOSE IN NEED ARE APPLYING- AND SO THE- THEREFORE THE IDEA OF HAVING THESE- KIND OF. BACKGROUNDS OF PEOPLE CAN APPLY AT ANY TIME IN THE AND BE ORGANIZED INTO ROUNDS BASED ON WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE ELIGIBILITY CATEGORY. I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL THAT IS VERY HELPFUL SO THAT THAN WITH RESPECT TO ELIGIBILITY AT MY UNDERSTAND GUYS THAT THE THRESHOLD IS 80% OF AMI'S TO CORRECT FOR IT AT THE AT THE HIGHEST. YES SIR- BUT THAT THE FOCUS IS THE FEDERAL LAW- AT EMPHASIZES A PRIOR TO USING. GO UP AS HIGH AS EIGHTY IS MY GUESS. SO IS TO THEN THERE THERE'S THEIR SERVICE SEPARATE FROM WHICH- THERE ARE SOME LARGE NUMBER OF. TENANTS WHO HAVE NOT PAID RENT WHO WHO SUGGESTED MEDIAN INCOME IS HIGHER THAN 80% DOES THIS LEGISLATION MAKE ANY PROVISIONS- OR IS THERE ANY ALLOCATION FOR LANDLORDS WHO MIGHT. IHAVE NOT RECEIVED A REQUEST FROM TENANTS WHO ARE ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD. WELL I SHOULDN'T. QUALIFY THAT THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF WAYS TO- DEMONSTRATE. ELIGIBILITY AND SO IN ADDITION TO THAT 80% FIFTY PERCENT- THERE IS- AN UNNAMED. BEING UNEMPLOYED FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MONTHS- IN THIS RECENT CALENDAR YEAR- AND SO THAT IS ONE OTHER WAY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERALIZED. IS IT A FAKE ABOUT THAT 80% AND OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE THIS LEGISLATION THAT IT DID DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT. SPECIFIC PROBLEM- YOU KNOW JUST FOR TENANTS. WHO ARE IN ARREARS BUT WHO DON'T MEET THE 80% OR LOWER A MY THRESHOLD. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE STRUCTURES OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT IS CORRECT. RICHARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU US SENATOR AND SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU RICHARD- KIND OF PICKING UP ON THE ON THE QUESTIONS THAT- THE CALL FROM FOURTEEN TO ASSESS REGARDING THE KNOWN LEVEL THE NEED I THINK THE RESPONSE WAS THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE COULD NO- AND I'LL STIPULATE FOR PURPOSES OF. THE QUESTION COMMON WANT TO MAKE THAT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN NO IN EXACT TERMS RIGHT DOWN TO THE PENNY. BUT I HAVING SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS. IN A ROW HOUSING BUSINESS AS A PRIVATE SECTOR INDIVIDUAL BEFORE INVOLVED. IN FULL TIME ELECTIVE OFFICE AT THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD SOME YEARS AGO- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A LANDLORD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY WHO DOES NOT KNOW- THE NUMBER OF TENANTS WHO ARE DELINQUENT. ON HIS HIS OR HER pIT WITH THEIR INCOME WAS. AT THE POINT THEY WERE APPROVED FOR RESIDENCY AND THAT- IN THAT HOUSEHOLD. IN THAT TENDENCY. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS WHY. WE ARE REQUIRING IN THE LEGISLATION A PRE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT IT WOULD OCCUR UP AND DOWN THE STATE. QUICKLY OBVIOUSLY- THAT WOULD GIVE US AN INVENTORY OR PRE ASSESSMENT. OF THE ANTICIPATED APPLE CAN AMOUNT FROM EACH ONE LANDLORDS IS INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM- I PERSONALLY BROUGHT THIS UP- YOU KNOW THROUGH CHANNELS HERE. I WANT GIVEN THE SPECIFICS OF THAT- POKING OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS SINCE THE PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW HAS HAS ENTERED INTO THE REALM OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION- BUT CAN YOU CAN YOU. PLEASE RESPOND AS TO WHY THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN OR WHY WE ARE GOING TO RECORD TO THE SOURCE. THE SAME FOLKS WHO. WHO NEED TO APPLY TO GET THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION WHY WE'RE NOT ASKING THEM THAT AHEAD OF TIME SO WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THESE DISPARATE NUMBERS. WHICH SEEM TO RANGE FROM. ANYWHERE FROM THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN NEED YOU KNOW DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. WHICH IS CORRECT. SENATOR LYNN LINDA CLEAVER DRUM UP FROM PCS STAGE AND- I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING UNDER THE PROMISE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH FUNDING INTO THE HANDS OF LANDLORDS. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO THE PROGRAM THAT WE DESIGNED REALLY EMPHASIZES SPEED UP DELIVERY- BUT ALSO WITHIN THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM THE- THE WAY THAT WE'RE SETTING UP THE APPLICATION IS ESSENTIALLY A PRE APPLICATION PROCESS. I'M SO THE LANDLORD OR TENANT CAN INITIATE THE APPLICATION. THEY PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND ALSO TO SHOW WHAT THEIR NEED IS. AND THEN FROM THAT THEN WILL HAVE TO BEGINNING OF THE DATABASE OF WILL SHOW US THAT INFORMATION FROM WHICH WE CAN DRAW DOWN APPLICANTS THAT- CAN BE SUPPORTED THROUGH AND THROUGH EACH ROUND. I'M SO WHILE IT'S NOT SPELLED OUT AS A PRE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT BY THE WAY THAT THE INFORMATIONAL COME INTO THE SYSTEM IT WILL HELP US BE ABLE TO SIZE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THAT- THE NEED AND BE ABLE TO THEN- BRITT RESPONDED WITH A- THREE POINT FIVE TO. RESPOND TO THE DEMAND IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE DOING OUTREACH COMMUNICATIONS AND WHERE WERE. INSURANCE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS. IN IN THEIR QUEUE. IS WHAT I'M IN PARK. ABOUT A PART OF OUR- I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT I BELIEVE PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY AS ELECTED OFFICIALS TO COMMUNICATE ACCURATELY TO THE PUBLIC AS TO HOW THEIR EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE CALIBRATED WHEN WE START ROLLING OUT ASSISTANCE AND I'M NOT CLEAR AS YOU DESCRIBE. THIS DE FACTO PREOPTIC AREA APPLICATION PROCESS YOU JUST DESCRIBED. HELLO HOW WE GET THE PROPER NARRATIVE OUT BEFORE ROLL OUT OF THE DOLLARS BUT TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AS TO WHAT THEIR EXPECTATION SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY HERE BUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GONNA BE SOME PEOPLE WAITING. OR IN LINE FOR A LATER ROUND UP. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE- GET THAT INFORMATION IT'S SIMILAR. TO SENATOR ROSEN'S QUESTION EARLIER- HOW DO WE GET REAL TIME INFORMATION THROUGH THIS PROCESS- CORD CORE PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE GET THAT INFORMATION. HOW DOES ANYBODY GET THE INFORMATION. ONCE YOU HAVE IT SO THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE BEFORE. BEFORE THE ROLLOUT OF THIS FUNNY STARTS TO HAVE A- AN IDEA ABOUT THE- YES YES SENATOR WE NEED TO- ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM THAT WE THINK IS CRITICAL IS THAT COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC OUTREACH COMPONENT I'M SO PART OF THE LEGISLATION INCLUDES EIGHTY EIGHT CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE EXISTING HOUSING IS KEY- OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THAT THAT WE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE RESPONSE TO AB THREE OH EIGHT EIGHT. I'M SO AT THE AT THE SIGNING OF THIS DISABILITY WOULD IMMEDIATELY MOVE FORWARD ON COMMUNICATING INFORMATION ABOUT- THE NEW REGULATORY CHANGES AS WELL AS BEGINNING TO STAND UP THE STRUCTURE FOR THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND WE SENT APPLE TIME OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS CREATING AND WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE GEOGRAPHIES OF NEED NOW. WHICH IS CREATED BY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AND THAT ESSENTIALLY PULL SENSIBLE INFORMATION ACROSS THE STATE LEADERS SAID WITH I'M CONFIDENT PACKED COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS AND B. AND IT GIVES US AND ESSENTIALLY AND- A PLACE TO BEGIN TO FOCUS OUR OUR REGION COMMUNICATIONS- MESSAGING YEAH. AND ONE THING THAT'S BEEN REALLY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE RUN RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BOTH WITHIN OUR STATE SOME OF THE OTHER STATES AND CLARITY OF MESSAGE- COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATING THE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AS A FRIEND- ARE TWO THINGS THAT REALLY- HER ACROSS ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THAT THAT OUR STATE IS VERY IMPORTANT- ONCE THAT IT SETS EXPECTATIONS- IN TERMS OF WEIGHT WHO'S ELIGIBLE HIS NOT. AND SHOES SO THAT APPLE CAN SEND THEY DO REQUIRE GOING TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO WE WILL ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND UTREACH CAMPAIGN BOTH- LEARNS FROM LESSONS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THEN REALLY BUILDS ON ON THOSE ON THOSE PRACTICES. AND THE OTHER THING TOO IS THAT WILL REALLY EMPLOYER PARTNER THAT WILL PLAY A PARTNERSHIP BASED STRUCTURE WHERE WE WILL WORK WILL USE THIS INFORMATION AND THEN PUSH IT OUT THROUGH TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NONPROFITS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE DOING VERY WELL IN THAT IT INTO IT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TO HAVE THE- THAT THE HIGH. NEED AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SAN. GETS SYNCED THE HANDS OF THOSE NEED IT NOW. AND THE COMMUNICATIONS WILL ALSO BE ABLE LINGUAL- WILL BE ACCESSIBLE AND WILL BE- AT CREATED IN A WAY THAT THAT HELPS. YOU KNOW MEETS MEETS TENANTS AND LANDLORDS WHERE THEY ARE. AND TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION FLOWING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND- WE WILL BE COLLECTING AND AGGREGATING INFORMATION ON A MONTHLY BASIS. AND PROVIDING THAT AS AS A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT. YOU CAN BE ABLE TO SEE. WHERE THE APPLICATIONS ARE COMING AND I'M WHO THEY'RE SERVING AND STUFF THE FOLLOWING THE. CADENCE OF THE FINANCES THERE IS ARE GOING OUT. BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M- TRYING UNDERSTAND. IS THE ROLE OF THIS COMMUNICATION ENTITY. AS PART OF ITS ROLE BESIDES LETTING INDIVIDUALS KNOW IF THEY'RE QUALIFIED OR NOT LOADING COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND IS PART OF THE ROLE. THAT AFTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS FROM SO CALLED PRE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT THEY WILL ANNOUNCE. TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND- LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. HOW MUCH MONEY WE ACTUALLY HAVE RELATIVE. TO THE PRE APPLICATION THE- IT JUST SAYS YES OR NO WILL THAT BE ANNOUNCED THE MINUTE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. BEFORE MONIES DISTRICT. I THINK THE THAT'S I HEAR YOU ON THE YES AND NO SENATOR- BUT I THINK IT'LL BE A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO GET TO THOSE THAT THAT STATIC POINT IN TIME BECAUSE I. BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATIONS WILL COME IN ON A ROLLING BASIS- AS INDIVIDUALS WILL HEAR ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS INTO THE SYSTEM- SO WE'LL BE DOING ESSENTIALLY POINT IN TIME REPORTING- AS THE PROCESS ROLLS OUT. I'M VERSUS HAVING KIND OF A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT OUT FRONT- THAT WE WITH AND WORK AGAINST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROGRAM. YEAH JUST A- LITTLE BIT OF THE- BUT- I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE'S A PRE APPLICATION PROCESS WHEN I ASKED WHETHER OR NOT. LANDLORDS WOULD BE REQUIRED. TO INDICATE WHAT THEY'RE ANTICIPATING NEED WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE REPLICATION I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY YES WE HAVE BUILT IN. IT SOUNDED LIKE ON A DE FACTO BASIS. BUT NOW I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT THEY WON'T HAVE THAT WE WON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION- COLLECTIVELY. WE WILL WE WILL HAVE THAT ARE ONLY BASIS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT EIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO BE AT ALL. OFFENSIVE IN ALL RIGHT TO JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO- BEEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHERE WE- CERTAINLY HAD SOME ISSUES THERE IN TERMS OF. GETTING INFORMATION OUT ON A TIMELY BASIS OF NOTHING'S PERFECT ESPECIALLY IN A NEW. SITUATION LIKE THIS. BY IT DOES SEEM LIKE TIME AND AGAIN. WE HAVE TRIED TO GET DELIVERY OF DOLLARS OUT DELIVERY OF VACCINES- DELIVERY OF ANY NUMBER OF THINGS OUT WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING THE METRICS OF WHAT THE NEED. IS ANXIOUS SIX SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A POINT IN TIME. APPROACH THAT CAN BE DONE VERY VERY QUICKLY. I WOULD PRESUME IN A WEEK'S TIME. A BY ANY LANDLORD WHO SIMPLY PRESSES A BUTTON ON A ON A- ON A COUNTY PROGRAM. PULLS UP THE RENT ROLL IT DELIVERS THAT INFORMATION IF THEY WANT TO BE ELIGIBLE. OF FOR THE FOR THE ROLL OUT OF DOLLARS SETS ITS OWN SUGGESTING I'M NOT I'M PRODUCING HEARING IS THAT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE PLAN. IN A TROUBLED BY THE END OF CONCERNED BY THAT. IN IT I THINK IT'S- LIKELY TO CAUSE A LOT OF COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS IN A LOT OF BROKEN EXPECTATIONS. WERE DEFEATED EXPECTATIONS BY PEOPLE- CAN I THERE HOW OR THE IMPLEMENTERS. THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS ACTUALLY. SHOWS AND I HEARD THAT THEY HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED. IN ALL THAT IS IT. THIS IS OURS ARE THE CHOSEN. BY COUNTY OR THE OR THE CHOSEN BY AN RFQ PROCESS IN OUR OF P. PROCESS OR THE THIS H. CD ALREADY HAVE A BENCH. OF IMPLEMENTERS READY TO GO IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I'M HAVING SOME UNDER. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DETAIL OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK IN AND pANSWER AND JUST LOOKING FOR SOME OF THOSE BASIC. TOPLINE ADMINISTRATIVE RALPH'S THAT WOULD OCCUR HERE- THE ROUTING. SENATOR AND I'LL CANNOT QUESTION ACK TO MY COLLEAGUE LYNN WHO HAS SOME MORE DETAIL ABOUT HOW- THE PAYMENT WILL TAKE PLACE. THANK YOU. YES SENATORS SO WE HAVE BEEN- WORKING THROUGH EXTENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH- WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SERVICE. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS SHE REALLY I UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY WHAT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICE PROVISIONS ARE IN THE MARKET SPACE. AND AND SO FROM THERE WE WILL WE WILL SELECT EIGHT EIGHT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS THROUGH- HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- AND THEN AWARD BACKS. DOWN THERE. IN ORDER MULTIPLE IMPLEMENTERS IN THE STATE OR ONE PRIMARY WHO IS SERVING OUT. A TWO OTHERS. AS WE ENVISION AND IT'S THE LATTER. THE THANK YOU OF LESLIE I HAVE. THAT'S THE QUESTION HE SAID THE PREVIOUS BUDGET HEARING WHICH I HAVEN'T REALLY RECEIVED AN ANSWER ON WAS HOPING TO RECEIVE IT OFFLINE- AND I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE REST THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BY BY NOW BUT IT WAS JUST A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FEDERAL FUNDS- ARE RESTRICTED. HOW TO RESET THE TO. BUT CASH TENET ASSISTANCE I'M ASSUMING NOT SINCE WE'RE GOING TO BE PAYING MONEY FOR- MARKETING OKAY PARDON THE TURN WE'RE GONNA BE PAYING MONEY FOR HI I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS MAY BE COMING FROM OTHER SOURCES. BUT OVERHEAD FOR HIM IMPLEMENTERS AND SO FORTH IT IS ARE THERE. HOW MUCH LATITUDE DO WE HAVE AN IS THERE ENOUGH LATITUDE. TO DIRECTLY OUT OF THESE FUNDS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY LEGAL ASSISTANCE BUT TENANT MEDIATION PROGRAM STOOD UP- THAT CAN BRING IN- BUT LANDLORDS AND TENANTS CENTER AND A CONTENTIOUS SITUATION AND HELP RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES. ARE AND SENATOR CORTESE APOLOGIES THAT YOU HAD NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS FROM THE PREVIOUS HEARING- I CAN CIRCLE BACK ON THAT BUT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TODAY- B. TWO POINT SIX BILLION AND SPECIFICALLY THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE UP 210% MAY BE USED FOR- ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY INCLUDE THEIR SORT OF THE COMMUNICATION ASPECTS OF IT AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACTUAL PROGRAM ITSELF. SO THAT IS NOT THE SOURCE OF THOSE FUNDS- THE- DIRECT THE OTHER DOLLARS ARE ARE MEANT TO BE DIRECT. PROGRAM USES SO FOR. XANDER UTILITY- WITH A- FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND IN OUR STATE PROGRAM UNDER CONTROL- SO THAT'S SORT OF THE USE OF THOSE DOLLARS- IN REGARDS TO- YOUR QUESTION LEGAL AID. AGAIN THERE WAS- EARLIER QUESTION- IN REGARDS TO THAT AND THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS AN AMOUNT CURRENTLY THIRTY MILLION- THAT GOES THROUGH THE COURTS. FOR LEGAL AID THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL- AMOUNTS OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AND IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT WOULD ALSO GO THROUGH THE COURTS AND I SPECIFICALLY FOR- THAT THE THIRTY. AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT RELATED- CLAIM ON A SYSTEM THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY LEGAL AID BUT THE- THIRTY MILLION PLUS THREE HUNDRED- THROUGH COLLEGE AND THEY MAY BE USED TOWARDS- THE MEDIATION AND LEGAL AID. THANK YOU AND I DID HEAR THE RESPONSE THE LEGAL AID AND- I. AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE GO FROM ALAMEDA BROUGHT THAT UP IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK HE MIGHT EVEN AGREE THAT A MEDIATION ATTEND A HARDSHIP. RESOLUTION PROGRAM- MAY BE SEPARATE FROM FROM JUST LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PUSH BACK AGAINST- AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER THEY SHOULDN'T BE OCCURRING THERE. OF COURSE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS LAST QUESTION. WILL THERE BE A CALL CENTER SET UP- BY THE MASTER IMPLEMENTOR OR BY THE PUBLIC RELATIONS ENTITY. FOUR BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OR BY SOMEBODY OTHER THAN- CONSTITUENT SERVICES IN OUR OFFICES BUT TO RESPOND TO- THE ANTICIPATED- Q. AND A CONCERNS QUESTIONS ETCETERA THAT ARE COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE CONSTITUENTS THE TENANTS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE ASKING THAT QUESTION TWO OF MY COLLEAGUE LYNN THANK YOU. YES SENATOR THAT THAT IS DEFINITELY PART OF THE STRUCTURE OF THIS PROGRAM- SO. THE WAY THAT WE ENVISION IT IS THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STANDING UP A CALL CENTER THAT IS A MULTILINGUAL AND AVAILABLE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK- WE DON'T ALSO HAVE ROBUST EMAIL- TEXTING AND- AND WEB SERVICES AS WELL- WITH THE PHONE SERVICE WE THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF PARTICULARLY BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ISSUE. I'M LEARNING TENANTS AS THEY'RE GOING TO THE PROCESS AND HOW QUESTIONS- AS A FILLING OUT THEIR APPLICATION. I'M SORRY IF YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT BEFORE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT THE MULTI LINGUAL NATURE OF THE OF THE SERVICE OF THIS GOING UP I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AS A CALL CENTER SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU- SENATOR CORTESE- SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST A FEW BASIC ENQUIRIES- UP TO THIS POINT. WHAT IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED FOR THIS PROGRAM. I'M CAN I TURN THAT OVER TO AGENCY. FOR SENATOR I'D HAVE TO LOOK PRECISELY AT THE NOTES BUT IT WAS THE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED- BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT THE PRECISE NUMBER. OKAY SO ROUGHLY ONE POINT TWO BILLION TO DATE AND I ASSUME ALL OF THAT MONEY WAS ALLOCATED AND USED. CENTER I'M SO SORRY HAVE TO CORRECT MYSELF THAT'S THE AT THE OTHER LOCATION IS THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION. OKAY THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION WAS ALLOCATED IN THAT ALL OF THAT MONEY WAS ALLOCATED TO NEWS IS THAT CORRECT. I'M SO SORRY ALLOCATED AND- HONORING US WITH HER TENURE ALL THAT MONEY WAS GIVEN OUT CORRECT. I'M NO NO SENATOR THAT THAT IS JST REACHED US THE STATE THE STATE AND IT WOULD REQUIRE ON THE STAND UP OF THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE. WHAT THE ACTUAL NEED IS. HOW MANY PEOPLE OR THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT. SENATOR I WOULD AGAIN I WOULD GO BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENT THAT THERE ISN'T DIRECT EVIDENCE SUGGESTING- HOW MUCH THE ARREARS ARE- YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT SURVEY DATA TO BASICALLY TELL US WHAT THE MEDIA'S AND BACK INTO. ABOUT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA RANCHER ADULTS WERE BEHIND ON RENT OR IN CERTAIN ABOUT PAYING THAT RENT- AND MORE THAN TEN PER OF RENT HEALTH WERE WORRIED BEING EVICTED- OVER THE NEXT TWO MONTHS SO SAY USING THAT AS A PROXY A 10% OF HOUSEHOLDS CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLD RENTERS IS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS- IF YOU USE THE AVERAGE MEDIAN RENTS FOR THE STATE WHICH IS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS- IF YOU AGAIN USE THAT AS SORT OF A PROXY FOR THE NEED OF. IF THOSE RENTERS ARE A MONTH BEHIND YOU'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN ARREARS IF TWO MONTHS BEHIND THAT COULD BE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. SO AGAIN THERE'S NO- THAT THAT'S BASED ON SIR DATA AND LOOKING AT THE WHO KNOWS HOW. WHO HAVE SAID THAT THERE CERTAIN IN REGARD TO PAYING RENT. AND THERE'S NO. DATA THAT THAT THERE BUT WE USED AS- AS A PROXY FOR THE NEED. THE POTENTIALLY IT COULD- ANY FROM A MONTH OR MORE. AND THAT THE MEDIA- BRENT YOU'RE A AT. AT A MINIMUM HUNDRED OR. YOU'RE DONE OKAY. BUT WILL NOW HEAR FROM SENATOR MEN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING- STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURES TO TRY TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO THOSE STRUGGLING DURING THIS COMPANY KANEMI IS CRITICAL IN MY VIEW THAT WE PROVIDE A LIFELINE TO THOSE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR RENTS AND ALSO THE SMALL LANDLORDS WHO ARE RELYING ON THAT INCOME- FOR THEIR OWN LIVELIHOODS BECAUSE THIS DOWNTURN SO. I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS GENERAL APPROACH AND APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS IS CLEARLY GOT A LOT OF DETAILED PLANNING THAT YOU PUT INTO IT SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO ASK- SO FIRST AS SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE SMALL LANDLORDS. WHO TOLD ME THAT THERE TENANTS HAVE STOPPED COMMUNICATING WITH THEM QUICKLY NOW YOUR PROPOSAL DEALS WITH LANDLORDS WHO WON'T COOPERATE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S NO PROVISIONS FOR THE REVERSE AT UA ATION WHERE'S THE TENANTS THAT MAY NOT BE COOPERATING- pWOULD YOU BE WILLING TO CONSIDER MEASURES TO DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION WHERE. FOR WHATEVER REASON IT'S A TENANT THAT IS NOT SIGNING THE DOCUMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO BUY FOR THIS RENTAL ASSISTANCE. HER AND I AS I SAID- EARLIER THE- PROGRAM IS REALLY GEARED- TRANSACTIONS WITH LANDLORDS- AND- WE DID I GAVE THE EXAMPLE OF A TENANT. APPLY BEHALF OF THE LAND LED BY I THINK YOU'RE AT ABOUT THE UPBEAT BE OPPOSITE OF THAT. AND I I'M NOT I MEAN IT'S PUSHED OVER TO AGENCIES I'M NOT A SURE THAT. WOULD BE AGAIN THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT AND HE MORE TO A PLAN AND OF THAT'S- THE- ON OF TIME. BUT WOULD IT WE NEED A SOME A IS A THAT CORRECT IN SO THE TENANTS WOULD HAVE TO COOPER SO I YOU'RE PROPOSAL CORRECTLY CONTEMPLATES. WHERE THE PLAN SERVICE TO QUASH. RIGHT NAY FUSED INTO THIS- THAT FOR. I'M ASKING THE WHAT IF THE APPLIES WITH THE IS NOT COOPER. I UNDERSTAND IS YOU NEED TENANTS. ON SOMETHING TO GET THEIR RELIEF- SO ARE THERE MEASURE YOU MIGHT. FOR THAT SITUATION. AND WOULD YOU BE ONE TO CONSIDER. YEAH THANK YOU A QUEST PLEASE. YES SENATOR ON THE- THINK ARE ARE HANDS REALLY BIT TIME WITH THE FRONT LAND LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF REQUIRE. THE LAND THE TENANT PARTICIPATE- BUT TO ACCOUNT FOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE STE. IS THIS CAN YOU BASED APPROACH WE- THE- AND- WOULD BE. WITH LOCAL ORGANIZED SUPPRESSED THROUGH OR- AND WE WOULD FACTOR WE WHICH- OUT. AND WE WOULD- SIR NUMBER. OUR REGION. TO BE ABLE- KIND. THE TIME I- TO BE ABLE TO. ITS THE TIME OF THE- THE BILL COME. THE HELP BE ABLE TO. ANY DOC. THAT THEY- THAT THEY WOULD TO BE. TO JUST. AND IN THE PRO. AND- THAT WOULD BE PART THE PROGRAM. ROLE OF THE HELPING INCREASE THE UPTAKE- BUT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO. WORK RECALL- CAN OF THE ADULT JUST- THAT THE FEDERAL LIKE LET'S JUST. I'M NOT A LOT FOR THEM. I THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR THAT MAKE MY SICK QUESTION- I WANT TO FOLLOW ON WHAT'S- CORKER IN OTHER WERE SAYING. ABOUT JUSTIN. OF RULINGS OUT OF FISHING AND GET THE MONEY OUT QUICKLY. TWO MILLION MY CONSTITUENTS RIGHT NOW HAVE LOST FAITH IN STATE GOVERNMENT DUE TO A- FAILURE IS IT WOULD ET WHICH- I WILL NOT. WITH THE- WILL. I SAW IT IS- A GOOD FOR ME TO HEAR EXCHANGE EARLIER. AROUND OF THE MEASURE YOU ALL ARE CAN. WITH THE- PLAN AND OTHER. TO MAKE SURE. THAT ACTS WILL BE THE THAT YOU'RE FOR OVERFLOW THAT'S COME. AND I FOR- ERICA ANSWER OF MY COURSE OF WHERE THE FOR WOULD COME FROM- BY POINTING OUT THAT FIRST. UP 2% INCOME FOR THE FEDERAL ASSIST. I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD TALK ABOUT A MAN. ROLLOUT THAT NEEDS TO I THE LAW IN A FEW WEEKS AND SCHEDULE. AND SO QUESTION IS DO YOU YOU NEED MORE ASSIST FROM THE- I DO MORE. FIND FROM. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NGUYEN H. D. ROLE IS OUT. IT IS YOU KNOW READY TO THAT WAY NOT PROP OF THE THAT HAVE TO ME ROLLOUTS OF THIS TYPE. I AT THE STATE LEVEL IN IN RECENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENTIMENT FOR THAT. THE ONE THING I WHICH I LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. WE ARE TRYING TO. UP ON THE COMPLETELY NEW PROGRAM I MEAN THIS IS A- WIDE RENTAL. PROGRAM YES. BUT WE ARE TRYING TO. WITH THE LOCAL. THAT HAVE ARE BEEN IN EXISTENCE. PURSUANT TO SOME OF THAT CARRIED OUT. DOLLARS THEY WERE RISK. ADDITIONALLY MY COLLEAGUES AND AGENCY UPSET. IT THEY ARE DAVE ARE STARTED. ON- PROCURE. OF THIRD. EMPLOYEE SOLO OF- UNDER- AUTHORITY TO SO I THINK A LOT OF THE- THAT NEED TO HAVE. QUICKLY ARE- BEING CONTENT. AND WE'RE TRYING TO STREAMLINE. OUR STATE. SO IT IS- ABLE TO. SOME OF THE LOCAL. THAT IT'S ALREADY. I WITHOUT WOULD ALSO. OF JUST TO INVITE MIKE. DATA ELSE- IF I. MET ANYTHING. I THANK YOU SO FOR THE OFFER OF SUPPORT AND I THINK WE THING THAT WOULD BE REALLY. IMPORTANT AS AS THIS. ROLE WILL OUT. HAVING- HAVING LEADERS OF- HAVING LET JUST SUPPORT IN TERMS OF PROMOTE THE CON. AND HOW. AND JURISTIC AND CAN- AT BE INFORMED BE AWARE AND BE COMFORTABLE TO PROP. AND I THINK IS GOING TO AN ALL ON JACK TYPE OF PROGRAM SO HAVING THAT- THAT LEADERSHIP SUPPORT WILL BE. CALLS AT. SIX I TO BE ONLY FROM. HERE BUT- I THINK IT'S VERY AND THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT- IN I'M- THEY I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONQUER. IT IS FIND FOR AIDS. FOR THE IF ROLE OF THIS PRO. ASSEMBLY IN THE RULE OF THREE AT THIS GOT ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU ALL. I'M TRYING TO. A LITTLE BIT MORE HOW THE ROLE IS SUPPOSE TO PLAY MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT. THE FUNDING IS GONNA BE ALLAH. TO COUNT. OR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED. BASED ON THEIR WORK FOR AS AS A POP. BE FORMULA- TO BE COMPLETED IN LATER THAN FEBRUARY. OF THIS YEAR- WE CAN ABA. TO DISPERSE ALL FINES BY NO LATER THAN AUGUST FIRST- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT COUNTY SPECIFIC BLOCK GRANT. NOW ON YOUR- OF PRIORITIES. YOU GET ROUNDS PRIORITIES. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS IN COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE MANY. IN THAT NEARLY ENOUGH FUNDING. FOR INTERNATIONAL NEEDS WHERE IS IN PERHAPS A NEIGHBORING COUNTY I DON'T KNOW MAN ANYONE WHO I'M FOR EVERY. CLAIM WILL CLAIM UNDER FUND. BUT BUT SUPPOSED COUNTY- MEANWHILE HAS TOO MUCH FUNDING IS THERE A WAY FOR. US TO HAVE SOME. WHEN WE CAN GO BACK BASED ON THE PRICE. ROUNDS THAT YOU ALL HAS FOR- AND HOW DO THIS HOUSE IS ALSO. TO PLAY OUT WITH THE COUNTY BLAH FUNDING- VISA BE THE ROUNDS THAT YOU KIND OF ASPECTS OF. I DON'T THINK WHAT MAKES SENSE. YES AND I I'LL- AND THAT. FOR THE. THANK YOU SENATE I AM SO FOR THE FUNDING THAT IS GRANTS OUT TO ADDRESS TO FROM THE JURISTIC WHICH IS RISK FOR IMPLEMENTING- IN THEIR- AND THE IT WOULD BE IN A THE THOSE WITH PRIOR SYSTEM AROUND- SO THAT WOULD BE THAT WE BE THAT THE TEST OF HOW PIECE WAS ADMIN- FOR JURISDICTION THAT OFTEN THIS PRO. AND WILL PUT THEIR DIRECT I'M FUNDS THE PROBE. AS AS THE- AS THE APPLICATIONS COME AND THEY WOULD BE PAIRED AGAINST THAT LOCATION- AND THERE WOULD BE THAT THAT. ONE OF THE GOALS OR IN EQUITY THERE MAKING SURE THAT THOSE- THOSE RESERVATIONS POOLS ARE FILLED AND THAT THE- THE FUNDS GO TO THOSE JURISDICTIONS- WE WOULD SUSPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE IN MANY CASES OVER SUBSCRIPTION WHICH IS WHERE THAN THE PRIORITIZATION OF BETWEEN APPLICATIONS IN A JURISDICTION COME INTO PLAY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT I THINK IS THIS WORTH INR FROM REPEATING AGAIN IS. IS THIS CONCEPT THAT- AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE PROCESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO. HOLD BACK FUNDS THAT BEEN OBLIGATED. AND SO WE'VE STRUCTURED- THIS PROGRAM TO HELP WITH SIMILAR- JUST HAVE A SIMILAR STRUCTURE AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHERE FROM THE BLOCK GRANTED FUNDING IF FUNDING IS NOT OBLIGATED IT COULD BE HOLD BACK INTO THE STATE CENTER AND THEN REALLOCATING BASED OFF OF DEMAND INTO THOSE EXISTING RESERVATION POOLS. AND THEN- IN THE. IN THE SAME WAY THE THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY. THIS SYSTEM AT A CERTAIN POINT WE WOULD LOOK ACROSS AND WE WOULD SHIFT AROUND- WE WOULD SHIFT AROUND RESOURCES BETWEEN THE RESERVATION HOLES. TO ACCOUNT FOR DEMAND AND SHE MADE SURE THAT WE COULD ALSO SEND DOWN THE STATE RESOURCES. AND PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. AND SO I GUESS JUST TO CUT TO THE CHASE- I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE 50% OF THOSE THAT ARE UNDER 50% AND I WILL BE PRIORITISED ACROSS THE STATE. IRRESPECTIVE OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN WHO GETS WHAT FUNDING IS THAT IS THAT THE SHORT VERSION OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NOT COULD NOT QUITE- SO IS STILL WE STILL ARE. WE STILL HAVE THESE RESERVATIONS TO ENSURE. THAT THE FUNDS ARE GETTING DISTRIBUTION JUST DISPERSED ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. AND SO THAT WOULD BE. INTEL YOU GET TO THAT POINT WHERE IN TIME WHERE I THINK I'D HAVE TO CHECK AGAIN BUT I THINK IT'S AROUND- JULY. UNTIL YOU REACH THAT POINT THERE WOULDN'T BE MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE BETWEEN THE RESERVATION CALLS- IT WOULD JUST BE PRIORITIZATION WITHIN THE RESERVATION. HOWEVER AT THAT TIME WHEN THEY WOULD BE THE REDISTRIBUTION. CERTAINLY JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD- HIGHER NEEDS OF THE LOWER AIRLINE. WOULD SEE MORE OF THOSE RESOURCES REALLOCATED SHORT. CIRCLE I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. I'M GOOD THERE THANK YOU US SENATOR MEN SENATOR MCGUIRE. BECAUSE OF THAT AND DO SHARE YOUR YOUR YOUR MIKE'S NOT ON YET. OKAY FRENCH FOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH MATTER MEDICARE FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO SAY I THANK YOU TO THE BUDGET YEAR TO THE PRO TEM THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE- BOTH HOUSES THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT CENTRE CABALLERO UP FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO. HAVE BRINGING IT IS CRITICAL PROPOSAL FOR HERE TODAY- THEY'RE JUST TO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS I HAVE- VENTURE IF IT WORKS FOR YOU ONE ON RURAL COUNTIES THE SECOND ON MEDIUM SIZE COUNTIES STATUS- IN ONE A- I I'LL DIRECTORS TO MISLEAD MISLI IF YOU WANT YOU CAN. DIRECT IT OUT TO THE APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUAL OR ANSWER YOURSELF. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE I AM GOOD ON THE CADENCE FOR THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT WILL BE DIRECTLY ALLOCATED FOR COUNTIES LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. TO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FUNDS WILL B MANAGED. BY STATE SELECTED VENDOR. THE DOLLARS WITHIN FOUR FROM THE STATE'S VENDOR. TO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES. WHO WERE WORKING ON WHETHER IT'S TENET OR HOUSING ISSUES. I WANNA IT JUST CLARIFY. DOES THE STATE ACTUALLY GRANT OUT THE MONEY OR WITH THOSE LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND GRANT OUT THE MONEY. SENATE THE STATE WOULD HOLD THE CONTRACT WITH THAT- THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR- AND THE THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTOR WITH AND WORK WITH LOCALS IN REGARDS TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE DOLLARS- IF YOU WANT. FURTHER DETAIL I'D HAVE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE- LATER A NEED. THAT YET BUT MY QUESTION ON THAT OR SPIN THE PROCESS BUT WHO WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE GRANTED THE MONEY IS GONNA BE THE STATE OR THE LOCAL ORGANIZATION. YOU CAN TAKE. I'M SUSPENDED THE GRANTING WOULD BE DONE AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL BY THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER- SO FOR JIM TO BE ABLE TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF BENEFITS- HELP INCREASE FRAUD PREVENTION AND ALSO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES IN ADMINISTRATION AND THE APPLICATION PORTAL AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS SO THAT THE PHYSICAL TRANSFER OF MONEY WHAT HAPPENED BY THE CENTRAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER. THE COMPONENT THAT WOULD BE- HUNTING HELPS AND MANAGED pTHE CURTAIN THE CARD NATION TO BE ABLE TO GET APPLICANTS TO APPLY INTO THAT CENTRAL PORTAL IN ENERGY IN YOUR DEFINITION OF THE CENTRAL PROGRAM- ORGANISERS. IS THE- THE STATE'S SELECTED VENDOR RIGHT IT'S GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TALKING THE SAME THING IS THAT CORRECT. THAT THAT'S CORRECT. AND I'M REALIZING I MIGHT WANNA MAKE ONE MORE CLARIFICATION SURE IS THAT IF IN A JURISDICTION- OFFICE FOR BLOCK GRANTS AND THEN THEY WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WERE. DISTRIBUTING THAT THE FUNDS SAID THE STATEMENT I JUST MADE IS ONLY FOR THOSE OPT INTO THE STATE PROGRAM CORRECT IF A JURISDICTION TAKE CHOOSES A BLOCK GRANTS THAN THEY WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WOULD BE ADMINISTERING THAT THE- THAT. THE FUNDS LOCALLY HOW TO PERSONALLY APPRECIATED SO THAT THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD SEGUE TO MY LAST QUESTION. SO FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE- IN A POPULATION OF 200-100-0400 NINETY NINE THOUSAND. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO ASK EACH CD ESSENTIALLY TO BE ABLE TO GET PERMISSION TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR- STRATEGY ON THE BLOCK GRANTS. EVEN THOUGH THIS JURISDICTION. OF ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED. DIRECT. DOLLARS SIGNING GIVING EXAMPLE. CINNAMON CAN. WILL RECEIVE FOR MAY INJURY ALLOCATION. IF THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RUN- THE BLOCK GRANT PORTION OF THIS FUNDING THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THE BLESSING OF EIGHT CD ON THE STRATEGIEN FORMULA. BUT ANY COUNTIES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ENOUGH. DON'T SO THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR OWN STRATEGY WITH THEIR BLOCK GRANT ALLOCATION SO I JUST WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON WHY THOSE COUNTIES TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND THE FOUR NINETY NINE THOUSAND HAVE TO GET THE BLESSING FROM A CD WHY CAN'T WE JUST SAY ANYONE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND UP. AS WE'RE DOING IT CARRIES A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR NOT CAN RUN THEIR OWN PROGRAM. YEAH I'LL START WITH THAT QUESTION AND HANDED OVER TO A NEW WITH THE DETAILS. AS I STATED EARLIER- PREVIOUS ROUNDS AND CARROTS FUNDING DID GO DOWN TO A STATE- THREE LOCAL COUNTIES AND CITIES- BUT THOSE WERE WITH POPULATIONS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE SO THERE IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY HAVE- TAKING THOSE FUNDS AND HAVE HAD. SOME TIME TO ALLOCATE THROUGH THEIR LOCAL RENTAL. ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS- THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT INSURANCE WITH THOSE ENTITIES THAT ARE SMALLER- AND SO THERE IS THERE SOMETHING BUILT INTO- PROVIDE. VERIFICATION ON THAT BUT- IF I I'LL I'LL TURN IT OVER. TO AMY FOR SOME DETAILS THANK YOU. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR HELLO THERE- SO YES IS ERICA WAS DESCRIBING- THINKING OR THE INTENTION BEHIND THAT WAS SIMPLY THAT- THE- JURISDICTIONS IN THAT TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR NINETY NINE YEAH- SIZE- HAD NOT RECEIVED PRIOR DOLLARS CRF FUNDING AND SO THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO AND YOU HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM- AS ERICA WAS DESCRIBING SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY FELT THEY HAD THE CAPACITY- TO MANAGE THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN ALL THE OTHER ON DEMAND. BASED ON LIKE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT NOW WITH ENDEMIC- AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN- IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO- AND- YOU KNOW IF THEY WOULD LIKE THE STATE TO ADMINISTER BOTH THEIR DIRECT ALLOCATION AND THEIR STATE SHARE- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE. PROGRAM CAN DO FOR THEM- TO RELIEVE THEM OF THAT BURDEN AND ALL OF THAT- YOU KNOW THE VERIFICATION- AND ADMINISTRATIVE REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES- SO THAT'S ONE OPTION- IF THEY'D LIKE TO DO THE BLOCK GRANT- THEN THAT IS- REQUESTING THAT THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE SOME. CAPACITY OR- YOU KNOW APPROACHED FOR HOW THEY INTEND TO DO THAT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PROGRAM IF THEY HAD A PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE. A GREAT WAY OF ESTABLISHING AT. ARMS IT IS SO IT AND THEN THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO JUST CLEAR MY CREE THAT EVEN WITH THAT THE LARGE JURISDICTIONS THERE ARE EXPECTATIONS PLACED ON HOW THOSE BLOCK GRANTS ARE. ARE USED AND- AND SO THERE IS A SIMILAR SET OF. EXPECTATIONS AND RECORDING- AND ALL THE SAME PARAMETERS APPLY FOR THE. TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR NINETY NINE IN THE FIVE HUNDRED. BLOCK OKAY. THIRTY YEARS IN THE PER OF I'M SORRY I WAS WHEN I LOOK AT IT THIS ANALYSIS AND THEN JUST DIGGING INTO THE DETAILS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PARAMETERS BUT- BUT YOU SEE THE SAME ANALYSIS IMPRIMER SUPPLY REGARDLESS OF THE CATEGORY OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN A POTENTIALLY AS FAR AS THE VETTING YEAH YES. GOT IT HEY I REALLY APPRECIATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM HERE AND THANK YOU TO- AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR MAKAROV'S SENATOR DOLLY NEXT AND THEN LET ME LOOK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN SENATOR RICHMOND OKAY SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE- A SECOND SENATE-DISTRICT WE SAW IT. AS JUST A RECENT REPORT THAT TAKE CARES MANY THAT YOU DID NOT GET- ALLOCATED EVENLY TO THE RULE AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SO IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DIDN'T APPLY OR DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO APPLY FOR THE CARES FUNDING BEFORE- THEY WERE LEFT BEHIND IT SO I'M CONCERNED THAT. THE SAME THING COULD HAPPEN IN THESE AREAS WHERE THE POPULATION IS- ONE NINETY NINE AND BELOW SO COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW THOSE RULE AREAS. THAT STILL HAVE THE SAME NEEDS VERY. LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE RESOURCES- BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE DID SEE THAT IN THE- PP ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE WAS- LIKE 50% LESS. SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT I'D LIKE A LITTLE MORE FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE BROUGHT UP. FROM THE FROM THE LAST THE LAST SENATOR THAT SPOKE. SHARE AND JUST ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT THERE IS A THERE IS AN APPLE DISTRIBUTION IN REGARDS TO- EVERY EVERY COUNTY RECEIVING A SET AMOUNT- AND THE SMALL AND GIRLS WILL. WOULD RECEIVE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION WHICH- IS IN AND OF ITSELF TWICE WHAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY RECEIVE IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT HER POPULATION- CUTS. THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE THERE ARE A GREAT NEEDS IN SMALLER RURAL COUNTIES AS WELL AND THE CITY THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES- I WILL DEFER TO AMY FOR ORLAND FOR SPECIFIC DETAILS IN REGARDS TO- OUTREACH. AND OTHER WAYS- OF MAKING SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE AREAS ARE RECEIVING INFORMATION. THAT THEY NEED TO APPLY. YES I GOOD AFTERNOON- BUILDING OFF OF WHAT ERICA WAS JUST SAYING SO- FIRST OF ALL IN- KIND OF CONTEMPLATING HOW THAT MONEY IS. SPENT THERE WAS A LOT OF INTENTIONALITY AROUND ASSURING THAT- THE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS UNDER TWO HUNDRED- THOUSAND WERE- MAKE SURE THAT. THERE WAS AMPLE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SERVE THOSE POPULATIONS THE LANDLORDS AND TENANTS IN THIS POPULATION- WHAT ERICA SAID THE DOUBLING OF THE POPULATION BASED- ALLOCATIONS FOR THOSE AREAS- AND THEN- I WOULD AND THEN AS TESTS AND- DESCRIBED. ALSO THE- THOSE FUNDS WILL BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THEM THE STATE PROGRAM THROUGH THE- PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER THE VENDOR THAT IS GOING TO BE CONTRACTED- AND I WOULD SAY HERE. THIS IS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OUTREACH- IS SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS CONTRACT THAT- WE WILLBE- SECURING WITH A THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE- SOME. EXTENSIVE NETWORKS. IN ALL AREAS OF THE STATE OR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO- EXPAND THE ONES THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE- THEM SO THAT. AND THEN THEN THE REGULAR DATA COLLECTION- AND REPORTING IS ALSO A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ASSURE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. ADJUSTMENTS IN HOW AT REACHES OCCURRING IF WE SEE- YOU KNOW. DIFFERENCES YOU KNOW WE'RE IN IN MODOC COUNTY OVER- WE'RE DOWN ORDER WHEREVER IT IS INTERESTING AT CERTAIN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THERE'S ACTIVITY OTHERS ARE NOT. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS ON TARGETED OUTREACH WE NEED TO ACTIVATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TRUSTED INTERMEDIARIES- TO ABOUT THAT PROGRAM PARTICIPATION. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND WE'RE SETTING HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTER TO FOLLOW. THROUGH ON THAT EXPECTATION. WHAT WOULD BE FINE IF THE IRA. THE LARGE. SENATE DISTRICT G. IN THIS WHERE WOULD I FOR A THIRD VALLEY PARTY I COULD SEND MY VOICE COUNTIES LIKE MODOC COUNTY U. S. NINETY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN IT WHERE WOULD I SEND THEM IF TO GET THAT INFORMATION. TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T GET LEFT BEHIND. SO WE WOULD BE DOING- AS YOU NO ROBUST OUTREACH EDUCATION CAMPAIGN YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT JUST IS NOT JUST. OR YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE THROUGHOUT SOCIAL MEDIA THROUGHOUT AND YOU KNOW THE MOVIE RADIO OR TV ALSO SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT- THESE AT THIS PROGRAM EXISTS- SO. HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE KIND OF FILTERING AND SOME INTERNET ACTIVITY AROUND IT PEOPLE WILL START TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO FROM THE STATE DOWNWARD INTO THE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVATING ARE USING. AND YOU KNOW AND LIKE I SAID TRUSTED INTERMEDIARIES WHETHER THEY ARE THE YOU KNOW- I'M TRYING TO THINK OF CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS CHURCHES- YOU KNOW COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ARE KNOWN WERE ALSO BE PARDONING PARTNERING CERTAINLY WASTE- YOU KNOW C. SACK AND LEAGUE- ALSO WITH CERTAINLY A LANDLORD AND TENANT ASSOCIATIONS- IT'S ON THE GROUND TO KNOCK. ON DOORS IF WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME. EATING IN SIR- CERTAIN- AND- CENTER I CAN CERTAINLY- FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW WE I ALSO ENVISION ON THE LEGISLATIVE DEPUTY OR AGENCY AND I. CERTAINLY ENVISIONED THAT WILL BE- A LOT OF EDUCATION DISTRICT OFFICE. SO THAT- PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THE OPPORTUNITIES ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF THE MORATORIUM EXTENSION BUT ALL OF THE- THAT RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND- YOU KNOW I'LL BE WORKING WITH- THIS TO. BLOW INFORMATION TO TRAININGS THAT- DISTRICT OFFICES- CAN ALSO SERVE AS AMBASSADORS. I WOULD I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I. JUST WOULD SHARE WITH YOU THAT. I HAVE VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THINGS VERY WELL IN THE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE I MEAN WE ARE FIELDING LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CALLS AND E. D. DE RIGHT NOW. AND WE'VE BEEN IN THIS PROCESS FOR TEN MONTHS IS THERE NOT SOME WEBSITE THAT LOCALS ACROSS THE STATE AS A MATTER WHAT DISTRICT AND COULD GO TO GRAB THIS INFORMATION TO FIND OUT. WHERE THERE WOULD BE SO IF YOU'RE A RENTER IN NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE AT. YOU CAN BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT BESIDES HAVE TO CALL THEIR CENTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT THOSE ITEMS ARE I CAN IMAGINE A CHURCH YOU MENTIONED THE- FAITH BASED COMMUNITY DOING THAT MAYBE THERE'S NON PROFITS OUT THERE THAT DO SOME OF THIS I KNOW THAT THAT. THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION THOSE FOLKS ARE GONNA DEFINITELY BE REACHING OUT TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEIR THAT ARE IN THEIR ASSOCIATIONS BUT NOT EVERY RENTER BELONGS TO AN ASSOCIATION THAT. QUITE FRANKLY PROBABLY VERY FEW OF THEM DO SO I I'M JUST LOOK I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET INFORMATION SO I CAN SHARE IT ON FACEBOOK AND ALL THOSE THINGS OF SOCIAL MEDIA WE HAVE BY THE END OF THE DAY- I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS THAT BEHIND A LOT OF THESE PROCESSES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT SO- I WOULD WELCOME SOME LANDING PAGE SOMEWHERE. THAT ALLOWS READERS IN AND YOU KNOW THE OWNERS OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET INFORMATION SO THEY CAN ACCESS- THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT FEET. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK EVERYBODY FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE AS HAVE THREE BRIEF THINGS ONE AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT OF WHICH YOU HEARING AT TEN MONTHS INTO THIS WORLD PRETTY EXHAUSTED AND OUR AND OUR STAFF OFFICES ARE VERY EXHAUSTED FROM THE AMOUNT. OF CALLS A DAY OF THE FIELD WITH WITH VERY LITTLE. WITH VERY LITTLE INFORMATION BEING ABLE TO GIVE TO PEOPLE RIGHT THE WEATHER TDD WHETHER IT'S VACCINES. ANY ANY OF THESE THINGS RIGHT SO WHICH IS IT JUST CONTINUES TO COMPOUND. AND SO I THINK PEOPLE HAVE. HAVING A HARD TIME HAVING FAITH THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO GIVE HOPE- AND CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE CALLING OUR OFFICES AND WERE EVEN MORE FRUSTRATED. SO JUST TO SAY THAT THAT I MEAN. THE SRVER THIRD BIG THING WE'RE GONNA DO SO LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE DO IT WELL- THE OTHER THING IS. SO WE HAVE BEEN INTERACTING BOOK THROUGH THE CARRIER'S MONEY AND WITH EVERYBODY DO WE DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF IDEA ABOUT HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL BE APPLYING. FOR THIS OR IS IT ALREADY THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE- INTERDICTION MORATORIUM ALREADY. SECOND QUESTION AND THEN MY THIRTIES JUST ARE WE DOING ENOUGH FOR MORTGAGE- A LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN PAID WHO ARE STILL SITTING ON MORTGAGES AND COMING DO ARE WE DOING ENOUGH. AND THIS IS BILL. ENVISION US DOING ENOUGH TO HELP THEM. HI YES I AM SO JUST. A QUICK FOLLOW UP ON YOUR FIRST POINT- CENTER AND MEN AND ALSO CENTER DOLLIES WE WAIT THERE IS ACTUALLY A WEBSITE. CALLED HOUSING IS KEY AND THAT'S UP AND RUNNING AND THAT IS- GOING TO BE THAT SORT OF A LANDING SPOT THAT- FOODS CAN GO TO FOR ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF. INFORMATION SO JUST WANTED TO- POINTED OUT TO THE GROUP- IN REGARDS TO. YOUR YOUR QUESTION- I'M MORTGAGE- OWNERS. AND THIS F- WHAT. AB AT WOULD ACTUALLY DO IS EXTEND THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS RELATED TO MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE FOR CLASS THAT WAS ALREADY EMBEDDED IN AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT AND THAT'S THOSE ARE THINGS SUCH AS REQUIRING LENDERS PROVIDING DETAILED EXPLANATION. FOR ANY DENIAL OF HER PARENTS ARE PROVIDING THE HOMEOWNER TWENTY ONE DAYS TO CORRECT ANY MISSING INCORRECT INFORMATION ON THE REQUEST SO A LOT OF WITHIN THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS ALSO. BEING EXTENDED THROUGH- THIS TRAILER BILL. AND I'M SORRY TODAY. BUT AS FAR AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE'S NO ISSUES WITH THAT THAT HAS BEEN THAT HAS BEEN WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM FROM- MORTGAGE HOLDERS. ANYTHING DIFFERENT- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF AGENCY- YOU HAVE MORE INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO FEEDBACK. THIS IS A NEAT- GOOD AFTERNOON US SENATOR I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- MOST MORTGAGES ARE FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGES AND- SO THOSE ARE FALL UNDER THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR FORBEARANCE- AND SO MANY HOMEOWNERS- BORROWERS ARE AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR- EXTENSIONS- A- FORBEARANCE- UNDER THOSE PROTECTIONS AND THEN THIS STATE. AS ERICA MENTIONED- THE STATE LEVEL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- KIND OF SUPPLEMENT THAT- IF FOR SOME REASON THERE IS A DENIAL OF A FORBEARANCE I REQUEST. THE BILL DOES- INCLUDE A CERTAIN- OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DAY. THE HOMEOWNER TO- YOU KNOW CORRECT AND- REAPPLY FOR THE FORBEARANCE IN GAMES AND RECONSIDERATION OF THAT PROCESS. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT ABOUT 70% OF- MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE IS FEDERALLY BACKED SO THAT'S A LARGE CHUNK OF THOSE- PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE- ISSUE TRYING TO HELP THE- I THINK MY COLLEAGUE LYNN COULD SPEAK TO THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT FUNDS WHICH IS ANOTHER SOURCE OF SUPPORT AND THAT WITH THE STATE HAS. FOR HOMEOWNERS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MAY I AM YES THE COMPANY HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY KELLY TRIVEDI HAS LAUNCHED- A SUPPORT PROGRAM THEM USING NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT FUNDS IT'S CHU FACES THE FIRST IS ONGOING NOW AND THAT IS PROVIDING HOUSING COUNSELING SERVICES AND TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ON AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE- AND- THE SECOND PHASE OF THAT IS GETTING READY TO LAUNCH AS WELL IN THE ABSTRACT MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE- TO HOUSEHOLDS THAT THAT THAT ARE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE AND SO THAT WOULD BE ABLE THEM SINGLE FAMILY AND- AND- LANDLORDS TENANTS- PROPERTIES. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL BE DOING HAS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A SWASTIKA POSSIBLE IS IF SOMEBODY WHO MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITHIN AN APPLICATION WHERE THEY WOULD BE MORE ELIGIBLE FOR STATE THE MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WE WOULD HAVE A REFERRAL STRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION I'M TO GET THE TO GET. A HOUSEHOLD TO THE TO THE RIGHT PLACE. FOR ANY DO WE HAVE ANY AYE. ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY AVAILING THEMSELVES TO THIS TO THE TO THE- EVICTION MORATORIUM ARE THERE GONNA BE A BUNCH MORE THAT ARE GOING TO APPLY OR IS IT IS IT IT'S THE SAME MOSTLY THE SAME GROUP THEY'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT. ENGINE TAKEN- YOU RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION. SERVICE CENTER MY- MY SECTION WOULD BE WITH THE EVICTION MORATORIUM IT WOULD JUST MAINTAIN BECAUSE IT MAINTAINS THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE- I NOT- I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT THE SAME POPULATION THERE MAY BE SOME- NEW. AND NEW TENANTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING COULD BE RELATED TO- HARDSHIPS AND WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT THE- THAT DECLARATION TO THEIR LANDLORD- AND THIS WOULD ENABLE THEM TO DO THAT- IF THEY ARE IF THEY MAYBE MORE RECENTLY HAVE EXPERIENCED- A HARDSHIP THAT THEY MORE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR- THIS BILL CREATES THE CONTINUITY THOUGH FOR THOSE- FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN DURING- AND STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS PERIOD. SINCE ALMOST A YEAR NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR EGGMAN LET ME SEE THE FIRE THOSE MEMBERS WHO WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS. YES OKAY I HAVE JUST A COUPLE BEFORE WE OPEN UP AGAIN TO OR NOT AGAIN BUT BEFORE WE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC MIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT- SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS- THIS THIS IS DEPENDENT ON A STATEWIDE ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE STATE PORTION OF THE FUNDS HAVE WE IDENTIFIED ALREADY WHO WILL BE PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION. I BELIEVE- EITHER LYNN OR ANY CORRESPOND TO THAT IN DETAIL. SENATOR WE HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE MARKET RESEARCH- AND HAD AN EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH VENDORS- THAT TODAY HOUSES THE TECHNICAL KEEP ABOUT CAPABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED- BUT WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT- NO WILL WE INSTALL THAT THE BILL IS AN ACTIVE. RIGHT SIR BUT THE- THE EFFORT IS ALREADY UNDERWAY TO FIND SOMEONE HAVE SOME AN ENTITY THAT IS OR ENTITIES. CAPABLE OF A- OF HANDLING DESERVE FULL FUNCTION OF THIS. YES SENATOR THAT'S CORRECT OKAY- I THINK. THERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S- HOW I INTERPRET THESE IS THAT WE ARE WE WANT. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY TENANTS UNDER EXTREME ECONOMIC PRESSURE RIGHT NOW WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE A WAVE OF HOMELESSNESS WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THEIR LANDLORDS ARE ALSO UNDER EXTREME ECONOMIC PRESSURE AND WE DO NOT WANT TO A FURTHER BURDEN THEM OR TO HAVE THEM MOTIVATED TO GET RID OF TENANTS BECAUSE- THAT IS NOT THE KIND OF SITUATION WE WANT TO BE IN RIGHT NOW WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS THAT WAS WELL UNDERWAY EVEN PRIOR TO COBIT. SO HOW ARE HERE THIS IS THAT. AND OF COURSE WE- WILL SEE ALL OF WHAT'S GOING ALL BIT IS THAT THERE IS- WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THIS AND THAT WE WANT TO SEE IT SUCCEED. AND THAT THE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKING OUR TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE SUCCEED AND WE SUCCEED SMOOTHLY. AND SO THAT WE DON'T ADD EITHER FURTHER HEADACHE ON THE PART OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ON SAID I THINK THERE'S AN APPRECIATION THAT EVERYTHING WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN COMPLICATED. DIFFICULT HI THERE ARE STRESSES UNDER SO MANY BUSINESS SECTORS INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC. THAT NOTHING IS EASY BUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. DESIGN THE SYSTEMS SO THAT THEY ARE WORKING. I'LL USE JUST AGAIN THAT SIMPLY EFFICIENTLY AND OF COURSES FRAUD PROOF AS POSSIBLE. AND AS MUCH AS WE CAN USE EXISTING STRUCTURES ALL THE BETTER AND I THINK MANY OF US. LIVE IN REGIONS WHERE THERE ARE EXISTING FERRY FUNCTIONAL AND ROBUST EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND WE KNOW THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S GOING DIRECTLY TO THE LARGE CITIES THAT NEW LIKELY IN LARGE COUNTIES THEY'LL LIKELY USE THEIR EXISTING PROGRAM IF THEY HAVE ONE BUT IT WOULD BE WISE FOR THE STATE TO ALSO LOOK AT THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATING RIGHT NOW AND A PARTNER WITH THEM APPROPRIATELY TO ASSIST US IN THIS TASK- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS THAT WHILE I THINK THIS IS WELL DESIGNED. TO MOTIVATE LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE WHICH IS OF COURSE WE WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ALREADY MORE ALL RIGHT ALWAYS MARKET FORCES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY MOTIVATE A LANDLORD NOT TO. AND IN THOSE AREAS THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE FOR EXAMPLE VERY STRONG RENT CONTROLS AND IF THERE ARE LANDLORDS WHO'VE BEEN. ALL JUST- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WANTING TO. RID THEMSELVES OF TEN X. OR Y. FOR SOME TIME BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT UNDER THE STATE'S VACANCY DE CONTROL LAWS THAT THE- THE RENT THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET WITH THE NEW TENANT MIGHT BE A GOOD DEAL HIGHER. I THINK THAT WE WANT TO MAKESURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WANT TO MONITOR THIS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT TO CREATE. THAT CONTEXT WHERE BECAUSE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY THAT THERE'S SOME NUMBER THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE AND THUS WE FACE ANOTHER INFLUX OF EVICTION ACTIONS THAT REALLY PUT US IN. IT AS WE KNOW IT IS SO MUCH HARDER TO DEAL WITH A HOUSING SITUATION AFTER SOMEONE IS INFECTED SO IF WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE THAT HAS GOT TO BE OUR OBJECTIVE- SO WITH THAT I FEEL LIKE. THIS IS- WE'VE GOT A GOOD INITIAL STRUCTURE THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME THINGS THAT COULD YOU KNOW COULD BE TWEAKED AND WE HAVE SOME TIME BEFORE BETWEEN NOW AND ONE INDEX AND I DON'T EAN BETWEEN WHEN IT EXPIRES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THIS BUT WHERE WE MAY SEE A NECESSITY TO TWEAK. AND I WOULD ALSO JUST REYES QUICKLY THAT FROM WHAT I AM VERY GLAD TO THE BILL WASN'T PRINT AS OF YESTERDAY AND THAT WE HAVE AN ANALYSIS AND THAT WE WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THE FLOOR UNTIL THURSDAY HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW EVEN IN MY BEST BILLS THAT WENT THROUGH EVERY COMEDIAN EVERY PROCESS THAT WE FOUND IN CHAPTER RING FOR EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD SOME TECHNICAL FIXES TO MAKE. SO THERE MAY BE AND LIKELY WILL BE SOME TECHNICAL FIXES ARE DRAFTING ERRORS BUT WE WILL HAVE TIME TO ADDRESS THOSE AS WE REALIZE THEM AND- AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. NOT ACTING GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A DEADLINE FOR OUR EXISTING MORATORIUM. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL FIRST CHECK AND SEE WHETHER WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC HEARING ROOMS MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THERE WAS NOT. THE CORRECT. OKAY THEN- WE WILL GO TO THE- TELECONFERENCE SYSTEM. AND LET'S MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW THE- NUMBER THE PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS. 844-291-6364 THE ACCESS CODE IS EIGHT SEVEN SIX EIGHT NINE FOUR ONE. AND I AM GOING TO ASK THOSE PROVIDING COMMENTS ON. BEACHES ST I WILL KEEP YOU TO A MINUTE AND- I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE VERY IMPORTANT POINTS SO IF YOU HAVE SOME VERY SPECIFIC POINTS TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR- GETTING TO THOSE RIGHT AWAY.

SURE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE. I WOULD LIKE TO. GO TO OUR FIRST COMMENT FROM LINE TEN LINE TEN PLEASE GO AHEAD.

MODERATOR PROCEED. THANK YOU AN OUTLINE FORTY NINE. STE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS GERRY INSURER I'M A PROFESSOR IN THE SOLE PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AND I DIRECT THE PRICING FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION IN THE HOMELESSNESS QUALITY RESEARCH INSTITUTE I WAS SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN PROVIDING STABILITY FOR RENTERS- AS WE KNOW WALL INITIAL CARES ACT OPPONENTS PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS AND PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO STAY CURRENT ON THE RENT RECENT DATA SUGGESTS THAT ONE IN FIVE RENTER HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND. THE BUILDING IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THIS AGREEMENT THE LIABILITY- TARGETING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST IS BOTH STRAIGHTFORWARD AND DIFFICULT DISTRICT COURT IN THE SENSE THAT WE CAN TARGET EXTREMELY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS BUT IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER A PARTICULAR HOUSEHOLD MIGHT BE MOST AT RISK OF BEING AFFECTED OR FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS- IN PARTICULAR IF THIS BILL COULD TARGET COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED WELL BY. OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY MAKE STATUS COMMUNITY NOT BEING A HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS EXPECT TRACK THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION- THE NEXT STEP EITHER WITH THE SPELL OF THE NEXT WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT A LONGER ERM STRATEGY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE RENTAL ASSISTANCE FROM THIS PROGRAM WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN FINANCE THE RENTAL LIABILITY WITH FEDERAL OR STATE RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE CLARITY IN IT WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT THE PAID WHEN IT WILL BE OWED THIRTY THE LANDMARKS AND LOOKING BETTER SO THEY CAN AVOID MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE IN CREDIT MARKETS MARKET DISRUPTION. SO THEY CAN PLAN OR IF YOUR COULD YOU EVER THANK YOU FOR. ME THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NOW TO LINE FORTY. I'D PATRICK WELCH WITH CALIFORNIA UTILITIES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PUBLICLY ON ELECTRIC UTILITY PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES HAVE A OFFICIAL POSITION ON AB EIGHTY BUT WE WANT TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION THAT BOTH THAT THE FEDERAL BILL AND THAT AB AT IN THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR ARE RECOGNIZING THAT MONIES CAN BE PUT FORWARD FOR RENTERS AND LANDLORDS TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS TO PAY DOWN UTILITY DEBT THROUGH THEIR LANDLORDS. WE THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE START TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT- USE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THEIR CUSTOMERS STARTED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UTILITY THAT THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL NOT BE FULLY DRESSED BY THIS INITIAL FUNDING WE THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA INCLUDING ASSISTANCE FOR OTHER TYPES OF CUSTOMERS LIKE HOMEOWNERS. COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND DIRECT ASSISTANCE FOR UTILITIES TO HELP ADDRESS A RESURGENCE RESULTING FROM COLD AT NINETEEN PUBLIC ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND WATER AGENCIES ARE NOT FOR PROFIT OWNED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE RATES ARE BASED ON COST SERVICE.

I KNOW A LOT FOR YOUR WORK ON A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE MY NAME IS LENNY FACTORY AND I'M HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE TECHNICAL CLIENTS NOT AFFECTING THE WHOLE ECONOMY I'M HERE IN BOTH THE PART OF THE EXTENSION OF THE INFECTION MARK TWAIN AND REGULARLY WALK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND SOMEONE IS JUST GIVING UP NOW ONE MOMENT PLEASE. AND NOW TO LINE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MANY VETS HAVE YET ANOTHER TIME THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE INLAND COALITION FOR IMMIGRANT JUSTICE IMMIGRANT RIGHT COALITION IN THE INLAND EMPIRE WE WORK WITH THE RICHEST UNIFICATION I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF. IN THE MARK TWAIN- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- EXPECTS KNOWING THAT. LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY IT WE ARE IN. THE MARKET. THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. EXCELLENT BOND. THROUGH ALL THIS CHATTER IN THE BACK ANYWAY SO- AFTER. WE HAVE NOW HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC. I HAVE A- COMMON I WANT TO MAKE AND THEN I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OF A- MEMBERS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE I TAKE A MOTION SENATOR NEWMAN. AND SENATOR BRADFORD AND THEN I THINK SENATOR WILL OKAY LET ME JUST WRITE THAT DOWN- ALL RIGHT SO ON. FIVE I WANTED TO RAISE ONE ISSUE THAT I THINK IS WORTH CONSIDERING IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO ALTER IN TERMS OF OUR ADOPTION OF THE BILL TODAY BUT I THOUGHT SENATOR CORTESE'S OF A QUESTION OR SUGGESTION WOULD BE TO GET EITHER WAY ABOUT A CALL CENTER HAD SOME MERIT AND I NOTE THAT THE UNTIL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE IS THE EXPECTATION THAT THERE WOULD BE. A WEBSITE THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE APPLICATIONS- YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW ANYTIME YOU SET UP A NEW SYSTEM LIKE THAT THEY KEEP AND- WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE THEY CAN RUN INTO PROBLEMS SO. OF COURSE- WE MAY EXPERIENCE SOME OF THAT. AND BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO KNOW THAT INTERNET ACCESS IS STILL A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT MOST NEED THIS ASSISTANCE. AND ADDITIONALLY- AS WE PUT THE WORD OUT. YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO GO AND SUCH AND SO TO IT I THINK IT IS. WORTHWHILE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IN. ROLLING THIS OUT INDIAN- THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VENDOR. WHETHER SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR WHETHER SEPARATE VENDOR MIGHT OPERATE A- CALL SYSTEM A CALL CENTER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- ASSISTANCE THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ANSWERED AND THOSE FOLKS WHETHER LANDLORDS OR TENANTS. KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO APPLY SINCE OUR THINK ALL OF OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO HAVE THIS WORK AS OPTIMALLY AS POSSIBLE SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT IN. TO THE CONSIDERATION HACK- I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT- CHANGES HOW WE WOULD PROCEED ON IS SOMETHING THAT COULD STILL BE DONE. ALRIGHT WITH THAT LET ME ASK AS SENATOR NEWMAN THEN BRADFORD THAN WILK THEN NIELSEN. AND THANK YOU CHAIR SO I BE VOTE FOR THE TODAY I WANT TO REVISIT ONE ISSUE THAT I RAISED. AROUND THE LANGUAGE. OF A REGARDING THE COMPENSATION LEVEL- AND AS A RESULT NOW IT READS IN FIVE OH EIGHT NINE SEVEN. ASSISTANCE FOR RENTAL ARREARS SHALL BE LIMITED TO COMPENSATION OF 80% OF AN ELIGIBLE HOUSES ON TAPE RENTAL DEBT. THAT IS LESS THAN CLEAR. THAT COULD BE READ VERY EASILY AS LIMITED TO MEETING UP TO BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO. AND SO WHAT I WOULD URGE YOU TO A TECHNICAL FIX TO THAT LANGUAGE. THAT WHICH I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT IS NOT INCIDENTAL SHOWED THE ASSURANCE. THAT WE GIVE LANDLORDS THE AS TO THE AMOUNT PROVIDED TO THEM. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE. YEAH AND SO WITH THAT I GOT ASKED THAT WE CONSIDER MAKING THAT TECHNICAL CHANGE FOR CLARITY SAKE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN CENTER BRADFORD. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK PROTEOME AS WELL AS SHOW FOR ALONG ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING TODAY AS ONE OF THE LEAD AUTHORS LARGE YEAR OF- AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER MEASURE. IT'S NO DOUBT WE ALL HAVE CONSTITUENTS WITH PROGRAMMING TO PAY THEIR RENT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DUE TO COLD BUT NINETEEN. AND THIS CRISIS IS HIT THE LESS FORTUNATE- DISPROPORTIONATELY UNEMPLOYMENT IS FIVE TIMES HIGHER AMONG LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RENTERS AND I THINK WERE ALL HOW THE PRIORITY OF KEEPING FOLKS HOUSED THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT HOWEVER WE ALSO HAVE CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE SMALL LANDLORDS AND THEY'RE HURTING AS WELL. STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGES AND I'M NOT REFERRING TO THE LARGE CORPORATE ENTITIES THAT EXIST AGAIN I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MOM AND POP OPERATORS WHO USE THEIR PROPERTY FOR RETIREMENT OR THE PAY THEIR COLLEGE- THE KIDS. COLLEGE FINE OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THE PRIME EXAMPLE YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS EUROPE- TO BOARD MY PLANE AND WAS FIVE L. A. X. OFFICERS HUDDLED UP TALKING AND ONE OF THEM RECOGNIZE ME BECAUSE I DID A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT CHANGE YOUR RETIREMENT AND THEY CAME OVER TO TALK TO ME ABOUT IT IN THAT CONVERSATION THEY MENTION THAT. OVER LANDLORDS. AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE HEIR MORTGAGE AND THE LAST THING THEY WANTED TO DO. IS THE VICTIM ANY OF THEIR TENANTS MANY WHO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME BUT WHEN SOME DID IT FROM A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS THAT- THEY APPRECIATE TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. BUT SOME OTHER TENANTS ARE JUST STARTING OUT AND NOT MAKING ANY GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO MAKE THE 25% AND ALLOW IT TO. FOLLOW UP IN ARREARS AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE GOING OUT BUYING NEW CARS AND OTHER. ITEMS THAT THEY SEE ON A REGULAR BASIS SO I JUST WISH WE COULD KIND OF LIKE. A LITTLE MORE TEETH AND MAKING SURE THAT A FOOT. TENET IS ABLE TO PAY THE 25% THEY DO SO WITHOUT LED IT ACCRUE AS MANY OF THEM SAY IT'S HAPPENING. THERE'S ALSO- A LONG HISTORY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR USING RENTAL PROPERTIES AS INVESTMENTS. AFTER BEING DENIED OR DISCOURAGE FROM OTHER TYPES OF- INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THIS AGREEMENT BECAUSE THIS RECOGNIZES THE NEED FOR. TENANTS AS WELL AS LANDLORDS TO BE COVERED. IT IS NOT AN END ALL BE ALL LIKE YOU SAY IT'S NOT THE PERFECT WORLD BUT IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. YOU ARE USING JUST- ALLELES INVESTMENT A RANT GET. THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IS STILL A HEAVY BURDEN THAT LANDLORDS ARE CARING TO HELP THE STATE OUT AT THIS CRITICAL TIME SPECIFICALLY SMALL LANDLORDS DESERVE THIS RELIEF. THAT'S WHY TODAY'S ACTIONS IS SO IMPORTANT. THE NEW RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RENT ARREARS AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE. AND THE 20% CUT THERE WERE ASKING SMALL. LANDLORDS TO TAKE IS NECESSARY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THIS IS STILL DESERVES ATTENTION FOR MANY GOOD ACTORS AMONG THOSE LANDLORDS SO THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I'M ASKING ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXISTING TALKS TO DIFFERENT LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO GET THE WORD OUT INCLUDING WORKING WITH TRUSTED. LOCAL VOICES FROM MY COLLEAGUES OF OUR EXPRESSED- WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHETHER ADDITIONAL SUPPORT MAY BE NEEDED FOR RENTERS AND LOWER LOWER LANDLORDS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRORAM PARTICULARLY THOSE IN HIGH COST AREAS WHO EXCEED. THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME REQUIREMENTS BUT ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO FILL ON THAT NOTE I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS NEW POSITION I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO VERY WELL SO ANYWAY I WANT TO DO- IMPARTS IN INFORMATION AND THEN MAKE A STATEMENT AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION. BUT I DON'T THINK DEPARTMENT FINANCES HERE ANYMORE SO JUST THROW IT OUT AND SOMEBODY CAN GET BACK TO ME LATER- WHILE THEY WERE TALKING AND I WENT. ON A SEARCH ENGINE AND I DISCOVERED THAT ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE HOUSING AGENCIES. FOR CALIFORNIA RENTERS ARE ARE IN ARREARS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION TO FIVE POINT SIX BILLION. SO CLEARLY THIS IS JUST A DOWN PAYMENT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT A PANACEA TO OUR CHALLENGES. AND THEN WE HAD THE PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAD ONE THE ASSOCIATIONS FOR WATER AGENCIES TALK ABOUT. THEIR STRUGGLES IN AGAIN- WENT ON AND SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND IN CALIFORNIA IT APPEARS THAT- AT THE RATE PAYERS- ONE POINT SIX BILLION TO CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WITH A BILLION OF THAT BEING IN THE ACTUAL COST OF WATER. BOND BUT ON THIS BILL SO- WE GOT TWO BILLS TODAY I'M GOING TO VOTE YES ON AB SEVENTY NINE ON AB ADR I'M GONNA STAINED. TODAY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION I JUST LITERALLY GOT THIS AN HOUR BEFORE. WE WENT INTO THE SESSION I UNDERSTAND WE GOT AROUND THIS BY AL THE MEMBERS OF THE- I'M TALK. WITH THAT SO TO ME THIS BILL FRAMES THE LANDLORDS TO ACTUALLY HAVING A CHOICE BETWEEN WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT I GOT YOU GOT ASK YOURSELF IS IT REALLY CHOICE BECAUSE EITHER WAY. THE FORCE TO FORGIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RENT OWED THEY CAN EITHER PARTICIPATE IN THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND GET A MAXIMUM 80% OF THE RENTAL ARREARS AND HAVE TO FORGIVE THE REST. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE. IN WHICH CASE YOU GET ONLY 25% ARE STILL EFFECTIVELY FORCED TO FORGET AT LEAST SOME PORTION OF THE REST- BECAUSE THEY ARE BARRED FROM RECOVERING DAMAGES IN COURT. WHEN THEY DIDN'T COOPERATE IN SEEKING RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO. I KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE- I DIED I DON'T THINK THEY REALLY HAVE A CHOICE IN THE END IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK YOU NEED TO BE FULLY FUNDED. AND THEN THE FINAL THING- AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HERE ANYMORE. BUT AFTER TODAY'S DEVASTATING AUDIT FROM THE STATE AUDITOR. AS IT RELATES. TO A FRAUD IN E. D. D. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WAY. THAT THIS RENTAL RATE RELIEF PAYMENT GOES ONLY TO LANDLORDS. WHO HAVE DECLARED RENTAL INCOME WHEN THEY FILE THEIR TAX DOCUMENTS SO WE CAN AVOID THE TYPE OF FRAUD THAT WE'VE SEEN A- DVD. SO WITH THAT- I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN ON THE D. AND I ON ON AB SEVENTY NINE AND AS OF TODAY I'M GOING TO BE A STANDING ON EIGHTY. UNTIL I HAVE MORE INFORMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WORLD- SENATOR NIELSEN. YES SENATOR KABIR MADAM CHAIR I ALSO FIND THIS MERITORIOUS AND WORTHY OF SUPPORT- BUT WITH THE QUESTION. THE ROLL OUT OF THESE MATTERS HILDA FOR HAS LARGELY BEEN CLUMSY. THE FIRST OF THIS WEEK ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE ABOUT EX EXPEDITING THE VACCINE. DISSEMINATION AND IT WAS WHAT PUT PICKED MY INTEREST WAS YOUR MENTION OF A WEBSITE APPLICABLE TO THIS AREA. IT WEBSITE WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE WEEK APPLICABLE TO THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER AFTER ITS ANNOUNCEMENT THEN I FOUND OUT FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE ONLY ONE COUNTY WAS GOING TO BE ACCESSING THAT WEBSITE THE MEDIA ONLY ONE COUNT OF FIFTY EIGHT. AND THE OTHER FIFTY EIGHT LIKELY WOULD TAKE UP TO SIX WEEKS. TO HAVE THAT AVAILED OF THEM. MY POINT IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE IN THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION AND NO MATTER WHAT IT IS. THEY'RE CONSTANTLY DONE INDOOR CHANGED IN THE CITIZENS OF THAT WE REPRESENT ARE AT BEST CONFUSED. I THINK THAT MORE PLANNING HAS TO GO IN TO THE CRAFTING OF THIS LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THESE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT THIS ONE AGAIN. HAS BEEN NOT FULLY COOKED IN THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN GET IT UNTIL YESTERDAY SO WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN THE TRAIN AND BE MORE. CLEAR MORE DEFINITIVE AND DISSEMINATED MORE WIDELY AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE IF THAT'S WHAT'S PROMISED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO THEN SENATOR DRAWS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SAY A FEW WORDS- CENTERS I'M GONNA I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF US SENATOR BRADFORD AND MYSELF ON THE SENATE SIDE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IT BEEN REALLY WORKING VERY VERY HARD ON THIS SINCE WE PASSED SB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. IN AUGUST LOOKING AT OUR CRYSTAL BALL THINKING THAT IF WE GOT OURSELVES TO JANUARY WE'D BE OKAY. AND THE REALITY THE SITUATION IS NONE OF US THOUGHT. A YEAR LATER WE'D STILL BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC WEARING MASKS AND WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A VACCINE OR NOT WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THERE WERE. A NUMBER OF GOALS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. ONE WISH TO PROVIDE AN EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM WHICH ENDS ON THE THIRTY FIRST OF JANUARY. AND FURTHER TO THAT END TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WEREN'T THAT WE WERE PROTECTING PEOPLE FROM ENDING UP HOMELESS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC TO PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO LANDLORDS. WHO ARE. IN ARREARS WITH OUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS OR HAVEN'T SEEN. THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR OWN RETIREMENT. AND AND SO THERE ARE MANY OF THEM ARE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. AND THREE WE WANTED TO PROVIDE HELP TO TENANTS WHO ARE DROWNING IN DEBT. IF THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PAY THEIR 25% THEY STILL OWE LEGAL AID OFFICE TELL ME. THAT THIS DEBT WOULD FOLLOW THEM FOR A GENERATION THAT'S THE THAT'S THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR DEBT. ON THE POOREST. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME AT NIGHT I THANK GOD THAT I'M IN. THE POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO DO THIS WORK AT HOME AND HAVE BEEN DOING IT AND I GET PAID BUT NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT LUXURY. AND SO IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LAID OFF OR THEY'VE ONLY WORKED A FEW HOURS- IF AT ALL. BET REALLY REALLY DESPERATELY NEED HELP AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES ALL OF THAT PUT TO TOGETHER IN A PACKAGE AND AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COMMITTED THAT THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BEEN. TARGETED IN OUR BUDGET FOR LEGAL SERVICES WILL GO OUT AND WE'LL GET PROGRAM TO MEDIATE LEE SO THAT. THESE OFFICES CAN CAN SERVE AS A RESOURCE FOR- TENANTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP AT THEIR OFFICE LOOKING FOR HELP AND DESPERATELY NEED LEGAL ADVICE. AND HELP IN BEING ABLE TO MANAGE THIS THE SYSTEM IS IT PERFECT NO NOTHING'S PERFECT BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXTREMELY HARD- SENATOR BRADFORD AND I STILL HAVE A BILL. WHICH IS SB THREE WHICH WE INTEND TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AS AS ISSUES ARRIVE AND I HEARD SOME GREAT COMMENTS HERE. THAT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO DO SOME WORK ON- BUT I THINK IT THAT- THIS THIS- SOLUTION BILL IS ELEGANTLY DONE IT'S VERY FINELY CRAFTED AND ARE THERE SOME THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE YEAH ABSOLUTELY WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND MAKE SOME CHANGES. BUT I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES EVERYTHING THAT WE WANTED ONE IS TENANTS THAT THE MORE TIME GETS EXTENDED TENANTS GET TO STAY IN THEIR IN THEIR- IN THEIR PLACES. SOME OF THE BILLS GET PAID LANDLORDS GET MONEY AND- AND MEANWHILE WE CAN GET OURSELVES TO THIS PANDEMIC AND SEE WHERE WE ARE WE ARE IN JUNE BUT I. I INTEND TO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND I AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE ASSEMBLY FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH THE SENATE ON THIS. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU. SENATOR CABALLERO AND SENATOR DRAWS OF. YEAH OKAY OKAY- YES I A. R. I WANT TO THANK SENATORS CABALLERO BRAD AND SENATOR BRADFORD FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK I KNOW OFF AND ON I'VE I'VE SPOKEN ESPECIALLY TO CENTER CABALLERO- AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT EVERYBODY'S PUT INTO IT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT AB EIGHTY TO EXTEND THE MORATORIUM- IT'S NOT PERFECT AS EVERYBODY KNOWS BUT IT DOES THE JOB OF PREVENTING THESE MASS NUMBERS OF EVICTIONS THAT COULD HIT CALIFORNIANS UNLESS WE TAKE ACTION ALSO SUPPORT AB SEVENTY NINE. TO IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US- THEIR NUMBER OF HOLES IN PROBLEMS I DON'T BLAME ANYONE AT ALL- THIS IS HIS HEART SO HARD ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FRONTS- IT IS OF CONCERN TO ME THAT IS A CENTRAL ISSUE IS THAT LANDLORDS DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT BUILDABLE RUNNERS ARE PROVIDED THERE ARE RENTAL DEBT RELIEF- THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND THAT THEY NEED OUR GOAL SHOUD BE THAT NO RENTER WHO HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IS FORCED TO LIVE WITH RENTAL DEBT HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS FOR YEARS TO COME. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT A LANDLORD PARTICIPATES ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES- THAT SOMEONE'S UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS COULD ENGAGE IN TRYING TO GET RID OF CERTAIN KINDS OF TENANTS ARE RENTAL HIGHER INCOME RENTER I URGE LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE IN% THIS UP AND THIS PROGRAM IT WILL BE SO ESSENTIAL AND SO IMPORTANT TO THE RUNNERS AND I COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES. TO DO THESE FIXES AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BILL AND HOW IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THIS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU ALL FOR WHO WORKED ON IT AND NOW I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON AB SEVENTY NINE I MOVE EIGHT SEVEN EARLIER JUST MOVED AB.
