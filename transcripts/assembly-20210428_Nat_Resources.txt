LET'S SEE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE- AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AWARD. TO PRESENT AB FIVE HUNDRED. MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A SEVERE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WITH THE DEFICIENCY OF THREE MILLION HOMES AND GROWING THIS ISSUE IS EXACERBATED IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF THE COASTAL ZONE WHERE DEVELOPMENTS FACE SERIOUS CHALLENGES NOW EIGHTY USE AND SUPPORT HOUSING CAN PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS. YET THEY ARE UNDER UTILIZED IN THE COASTAL ZONE IN PART DUE TO THE TIME INTENSIVE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCESS AT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN RECENT YEARS PASS LAWS TO STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS HE'S FOR EIGHTY YEARS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING HOWEVER WHILE DOES HELP CITIES THEY DID NOT EXTEND TO THE CD P. PROCESS WHICH ARE A STATE PROCESS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CLARIFY THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT HOWEVER IT IS NOT EXPRESSLY WITHIN THE COMMISSION SCOPE TO PROMOTE SOLUTIONS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE WITH OPPOSITION FROM THE COMMISSION THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE COASTAL ACT TO REMOVE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING POLICIES FROM ITS JURISDICTION SO AB FIVE HUNDRED WILL REINSTATE THE COASTAL ACT AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES THAT WERE REPEALED FORTY YEARS AGO. AND GIVE THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENSURE THAT NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS CONSISTENT WITH COASTAL ACT POLICIES THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO UPDATE AND STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY C. P. PROCESS FOR EDUS JUNIOR EIGHTY USE AND SUPPORT OF HOUSING WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE. I'M WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENT ITSELF A SIMPLE AN EXPEDITIOUS THE BILL RETAIN SUPPORT FOR THE EVALUATION PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE COASTAL TOWN WHILE REMOVING BARRIERS FOR EIGHTY YEARS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING ALONG COASTAL COMMUNITIES SO BY APPROVING AB FIVE HUNDRED COASTAL COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE NEW HOUSING SOLUTIONS. AND TO ENSURE THAT NOT JUST VISITORS SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS BUT ALSO RESIDENTIAL ACCESS TO THE COAST IS BETTER AFFORDED TO ALL CALIFORNIANS I'D LIKE TO PRESENT MY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL SIR CHRISTIE WHO IS IN THE- THE COMMITTEE ROOM TO AIMED. AT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION AND BILL PRINCE LUCKY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR PEOPLE ORGANIZED FOR WESTSIDE RENEWAL OR POWER WHO IS ON THE LINE. THANK YOU WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH SERRA CHRISTIE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS I'M SURE CHRISTY THE COASTAL COMMISSION'S LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AND I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE COMMISSION'S UNANIMOUS SUPPORT OF AB FIVE HUNDRED YOU'RE ALL VERY AWARE OF COSTA LACK POLICIES PROTECTING PUBLIC ACCESS TO NATURAL RESOURCES SUCH AS WETLANDS AND SENSITIVE HABITAT BUT YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT WHEN THE COASTAL ACT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IT ALSO CONTAINED A POLICY. PROTECTING AND PROVIDED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE. FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM THE COMMISSION AUTHORIZED THE CONSTRUCTION OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS WITHIN MARKET RATE SUBDIVISIONS THAT WERE SPRINGING UP ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST FROM MISSION VIEJO TO SANTA CRUZ. THE COMMISSION ALSO PREVENTED THE DEMOLITION OF OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED EXISTING UNITS. AND COLLECTED TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN IN LIEU FEES. BUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS AS CONTROVERSIAL THEN AS IT IS TODAY SO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL REPEALING THE COMMISSION'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITY. AND EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEMOLISH AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE. IT PROHIBITED THE COMMISSION FROM ACQUIRING HOUSING PROGRAMS IN L. C. PEAS AND IT AUTHORIZED DEVELOPERS WITH EXISTING PERMIT CONDITIONS TO GET OUT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE UNITS. AS A RESULT ONLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE FIVE THOUSAND INCLUSIONARY UNITS WERE EVER BUILT. IMAGINE WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD LOOK LIKE TODAY IF THE COMMISSION HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE PROMOTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE COASTAL ZONE FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS. AB FIVE HUNDRED WOULD RESTORE THE COSTA LACKS AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES AND REPEAL THE PROHIBITION ON LC PEAS. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER RESIDENTIAL DENSITY IN AREAS WITH ADEQUATE TRANSIT THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SEA LEVEL RISE. FINALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UPDATE L. C. PIECE TO REFLECT REAP RECENT CHANGES TO EIGHTY YOU IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING LAWS. SOMETHING THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN RECOMMENDING SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MEMBERS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDO THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST. AND RESTORE THE COSTA LACKS ORIGINAL INTENT OF A COASTLINE THAT IS NOT ONLY ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. BUT LIVABLE AS WELL. THANK YOU ALL REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS CHRISTY- BEFORE WE MOVE ON I BELIEVE WE HAVE A QUORUM. I'M MAD LIKE TO HAVE THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. MEMBERS RIVAS HI I MEAN HERE RIVAS HERE FLOOR.

ONE OF THE PLACES THAT ARE MEMBERS OFTEN TESTIFY. IS AT THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND I CAN NOT. IMPRESSED ENOUGH UPON YOU- YOU HAVE TO REALLY SEE IT FOR YOURSELVES UNDERSTAND. THAT KAFKA ESQUE ABSURDITY OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT THE REASON THAT THEY'RE- PRESENTING THEIR TESTIMONY ON A SPECIFIC LAND USE APPEAL. THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY SPEAK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING OR IF THEY DO SPEAK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING. THAT THE COMMISSION ISN'T TECHNICALLY ALLOWED TO LISTEN TO THAT BECAUSE OF SECTION THREE OH FIVE OH OH POINT ONE SURE YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS WELCOME. TO ROUND UP PLEASE. IT YES.

ALLOWS PROJECT TO BE BUILT WITHOUT COMMENTING ON CHAPTER THREE POLICIES WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ONE MOMENT. NINE THIRTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIRTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THERE ARE NO OTHER LINES IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY THANK YOU WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM. C. NINE ANY WITNESSES THAT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY I DON'T SEE ANY- ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MR STONE THANK YOU THINK YOU RESTORED FOR BRINGING THIS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU TOUCHED ON. IS THAT BECAUSE ONCE THE ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS REMOVED FROM THE ACT. THEN AS JURISDICTIONS ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SHORT TERM RENTALS WITH ANY OTHER WARDENS THE COMMISSION IS ONLY LOOKING AT THOSE POTENTIAL ORDINANCES THROUGH THE LENS. OF ACCESS AND VISITOR SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS AND CANNOT BALANCE THE NEED FOR LOCAL HOUSING. THIS IS WHAT. THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH TO GET THE COMMISSION TO APPROPRIATELY CONSIDER. THE IMPACT OF HOUSING ON A LOT OF THE OTHER DECISIONS THAT THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE MAKING. IT WAS TOO BAD THAT THIS WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. BECAUSE THAT THAT IMBALANCES REALLY SHOWED OVER THE YEARS AS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE TYING TO PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS TRY TO PROTECT HOUSING. AND ESTABLISH FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. THANK YOU SOME NUMBERS THAT I WITNESSED AS WELL TOO WHEN I SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND- AND SO THIS IS AN AUTHOR SPONSORED BILL I SEE TO CORRECT THAT. THANK YOU FOR THE TO MOVE WILL. THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION. SMITH THANK YOU HAVE A CERTAIN TRYING TO GET A GREAT ON SOME OF THE MAYBE THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE FROM HAVING ANOTHER LAYER OF APPROVAL PROCESS. AND MR STONE BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT IN THAT'S THE COASTAL ACCESS POINT. OF I GUESS MY QUESTION IS SO. IS THIS BILL MEANT TO ALLOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO SAVE THAT TO THE BUNGALOWS THAT ARE ON THE SIDE YOU KNOW ON YOU KNOW IN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS. BECAUSE THOSE BUNGALOWS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SMALL IN STATURE- THEY COME WITH A MIGHTY PRICE TAG. SO NINETY PRICE TAG IS UP YOU KNOW SOMEBODY OWNS THAT AND ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A- HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS JACKETS ACTUALLY IF IT'S ON THE STRAND IN MANHATTAN BEACH IT'S A SIX MILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF PROPERTY. AND WOULD THIS RESTRICT THEM. WITH THIS MAKE THEM HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND PROVE THAT THEY'RE DOING SOME OF THESE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR LAND OR SELL THEIR LAND IN LETTER DEVELOPER BUILD WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BUILD THERE BECAUSE- ALSO LAND ITSELF. IS WHERE THE- THAT THAT'S WHERE THE COST IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AS A MEMBER C. R. DOES SO THE ANSWERS ARE YES AND NO- IT DOESN'T. SO NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOME OF THE OLDER STRUCTURES THAT ARE THERE MIGHT STILL. BE AVAILABLE FOR SLIGHTLY CHEAPER RENT BUT SO SHOULD SOMEBODY WANT TO REDEVELOP THE PROPERTY- THEY THEY PROBABLY GOING TO BE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE LUXURY LITTLE MORE HIGH VALUE. WHAT THIS COULD ALLOW FOR IS THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NET NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WERE THERE THE NATURALLY CURL FOR LOWER INCOME OR LOWER RENTAL. PROPERTIES ARE SOMEHOW RETAINED. I'M I JUST FEAR THAT THE- PRICES AT THE BEACH OUR OUR ON THE COASTAL. SECTION OF THE STATE ARE ARE SIMPLY OUT OF THE CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S MORE OF A MARKETING ISSUE- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY WAY TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT IN THE COAST AREA AND SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT ADDING THIS LAYER- OF PROCESS TO. MAKE EXISTING DEVELOPMENT DOWN THERE IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU KNOW THIS SUBSIDY BUILDING AFFORDABLE PROJECT DOWN THERE THERE'S GOT TO BE HUGE. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET PAST THE BUILDING COSTS AS SOON AS THE THINGS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT PROPERTY IS WORTH WAY MORE THAN YOU BOUGHT IT EVEN IF YOU DEED RESTRICTED I AGREE WITH YOU THERE'S A LOT OF MARKET BASED- CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO INTO THE HOUSING- HOUSING PRICING- BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS A SUBSIDY RELATED SOLUTIONS THIS ALSO CAN BE ABLE TO PROMOTE. SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT OFFER INCENTIVE BASED SOLUTIONS TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN OR EVEN DEVELOP MORE MIXED INCOME MIXED AFFORDABLE HOUSING- IN ADDITION TO MARKET RATE HOUSING. WELL THEY THEY TAXPAYERS THAT SUBSIDIZE THAT NEED TO GET THE BANG FOR THEIR BUCK AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET AT THE COAST THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT I SEE THE WITNESS HAS. A POTENTIAL. QUESTION ANSWERS TO MY QUESTION WITH WITH THE CHAIR IN THE AUTHOR'S PERMISSION ASSEMBLY MEMBER SEATTLE. I'M THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU LIKE HER TO CONTEST THANK YOU WANT TO COME AND GO HEAD ASSEMBLY MEMBER I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE COMMISSION IN ITS FIFTY YEAR HISTORY HAS NEVER DENIED AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT. SO I JUST WANT TO GET THAT ON THERE FOR THE RECORD. BUT WE'RE WE'RE THIS BILL. IF THE CALLS ON IS PRIMARILY BUILT OUT NOW IS. RECOGNIZE AND THERE'S A LOT OF EXPENSIVE HOUSING THERE. WHERE THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE MOST BENEFIT TODAY IS THAT IN THE LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE PREPARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION. WHEN THEY'RE BEING PREPARED OR WEIRD WHEN THEY'RE BEING AMENDED. THOSE ARE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT- DESIGNATE THE ZONING AREAS THE DENSITY THAT TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT THE VARIOUS PROCESSES THAT HAVE TO BE- GONE THROUGH IN ORDER TO GET YOUR PERMITS. AT THAT STAGE RIGHT NOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS NO AUTHORITY. TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCREASE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE. BECAUSE WERE SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITED FROM EVEN CONSIDERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THESE LAND USE PLANS WHICH IS ABSURD. BECAUSE THE COST LOOKS STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED FAR FAR BEYOND WHERE THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO STAY. THIS WOULD GIVE US ADDITIONAL SEAT AT THE TABLE ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE IF YOU WILL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT MAY NOT BE QUITE AS COMMITTED AS WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE TO PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO GET BETTER LAND USE PLANS TO GET BETTER ZONING MAPS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THE STATE MOST OF THE COASTAL ZONE IS OPERATING UNDER CERTIFIED LCP WE'RE NOT ISSUING THE PERMITS ANYMORE. SO IT WOULDN'T BE ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY FOR APPROVAL IT WOULD SIMPLY BE MAKING SURE THAT THE NEW DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING FORWARD. ACTUALLY REFER REFLECTS THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITY TO PROVIDE FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN SOME OF THESE LEAST AFFORDABLE AREAS I BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO- THERE'D THERE OFFICIALS ARE DIRECT OR- FOR THE PEOPLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE. IN IN THEIR DISTRICT. AND BUT I THINK THAT VOICE IS BETTER HEARD BY THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT THAT COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THERE IS A LIMITED ABILITY I USED TO LIVE DOWN AND IN THE BEACH AREA THAT'S WHY KNOW ABOUT MANHATTAN BEACH- BUT THAT WAS WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND SINGLE- I HAD MOVED INLAND. IF I COULD AFFORD TO LIVE DOWN THERE AND I NEVER DREAMED THAT I'D BE ABLE TO AFFORD I DON'T I CAN'T STILL. SO ANYWAY. THAT'S A LIFESTYLE CHANGE YOU MAKE BECAUSE OF THE IN AFFORDABILITY OF BEING AT THE BEACH I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE. AND I THINK CITY COUNCILS NEED TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT- IF THEY'RE GOING TO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION. AND THE STATE ENTERING INTO CITY COUNCIL COASTAL CITIES ARE GOING TO HELP FIX THAT WE'RE LOSING DENSITY IN THE COASTAL ZONE BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE APPROVING DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS THAT ARE. THAT ARE DEMOLISHING EXISTING DUPLEXES TRIPLEXES AND FOUR PLEXUS THEY MAY NOT BE CHEAP. BUT IN THE COASTAL ZONE THEY ARE THE MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE APPROVING THEIR DEMOLITION. AND REPLACING THEM WITH GIANT STATEMENT HOMES SO WE'RE ACTUALLY LOSING RESIDENTIAL UNITS IN THE COASTAL ZONE BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN APPROVE THAT UNDER THE MELLOW ACT FROM FORTY YEARS AGO THERE EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED. TO APPROVE THE DEMOLITION OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS AND- TAKE THEM OUT OF THE COASTAL ZONE. THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE THE COMMISSION TO STOP AT LEAST TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NO EXISTING AFFORDABLE UNITS ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA. AND AND I ALSO ARGUED THAT IF WE'RE LOSING A LITTLE BIT OF DENSITY IN THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD HELP TRAFFIC A WHOLE LOT. BECAUSE THERE'S H. EXTREME AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN THOSE AREAS. IT'LL TAKE YOU THREE HOURS TO GET FROM SANTA MONICA DOWN. TO REDONDO BEACH SO. ANYWAY- I I'VE I'VE HEARD IT REFERRED WHAT I NEED TO HEAR AND I. YOUR EFFORTS THANKS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR STONE YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THIS IS ACTUALLY A MAJOR TOOL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE ONCE AT THE L. C. P. IS TO GO TO WITH THE COMMISSION IT BECOMES THE STANDARD OF REVIEW. IF THE L. C. P. AND THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND DO THE THINGS IT NEEDS TO DO DEALING WITH. WITH THE SHORT TERM RENTALS DEALING WITH A MYRIAD OF THINGS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE DEALING WITH ALONG THE COAST MY JURISDICTION CASE IN POINT WE DO HAVE SOME AFFORDABILITY. WHEN PEBBLE BEACH VERY VERY HIGH END WANTED TO BUILD SOME. SOME HOUSING THERE WAS A DESPERATE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IT TO THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT SO THAT BECAUSE OF THE WILLINGNESS OF PEBBLE BEACH AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY REALLY PUSHING ON IT THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE EXACTLY THAT CONVERSATION SO WE'RE REALLY MISSING THE POINT HERE. IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE COMMISSION INTERACTS WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HOW ELSE HE PEES ARE CREATED. AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF CONTROL THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE OVER THOSE DECISIONS THIS IS A BILL THAT GIVES THEM. THE BREADTH OF THAT CONTROL DEALING WITH HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL IMPACT HOUSING IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THAT'S WHY THIS IS A GREAT BILL. WORKFORCE HOUSING AND COAST ARMENIAN AREAS THAT ARE MORE- RECREATIONAL- AND TOURIST- DRIVEN- IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR YOU AND ME. AND LIVING IN ASSEMBLY BELIEVE HE'S ONLY I UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH I KNOW AND I KNOW YOU DO IT I. FEEL THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR COASTAL JURISDICTIONS LIKE MY RIGHT AND CITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT RESPONSIBILITY I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. I OTHER. FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MY STORE MANAGER AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR SCHEDULING THIS BILL FOR HEARING TODAY- I WANNA ALSO KNOWLEDGE FOR THE- THE- THE CALLER FROM LONG BEACH OR ANYBODY ELSE THAT HAS QUESTIONS OR CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL THEY'RE WALKING TO CALL MY OFFICE I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE CONCERNS. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- I DON'T. THANK YOU I'M WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MR STONE. WE NEED A SECOND FROM MISTER WOULD- SECRETARY Q. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I DON'T WANT AB FIVE HUNDRED BY MEMBER BOARD. THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. MEMBERS RIVAS HI RIVAS FIVE FLORA. CHAU CHAU I FRIEDMAN GARCIA MATHIS MCCARTY WROTE TO G. SAY OUR TOTAL. THERE ARE NO STONE STONE I WOULD. I FOR ONE K. FOUR ONE WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M NEXT UP WE HAVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA PRESENTING AB. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING HIV HEPATITIS C. AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL PROTECT THESE VITAL SERVICES BY PROVIDING THESE PROGRAMS AND EXEMPTION FROM SEQUEL REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A RISE IN DRUG RELATED HARMS INCLUDING OVERDOSE DEATHS HEPATITIS C. DIAGNOSIS RATES AND INCREASED RATES OF POTENTIAL HIV TRANSMISSION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCESS TO STERILE SYRINGES REDUCES HIV AND VIRAL HEPATITIS INFECTIONS WHILE BEING SAFE EFFECTIVE AND COST SAVINGS. CALIFORNIA SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SYRINGE ACCESS AND DISPOSAL INCLUDING HIV AND HEPATITIS TESTING OVERDOSE PREVENTION TRAINING AND REFERRALS TO DRUG TREATMENT HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE SERVICES HAVE HELPED TO GARNER THE TRUST IN PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE SEEK OUT HARM REDUCTION SERVICES. BUT RECENTLY UNEXPECTED LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE ARISEN. DESPITE THE CLEAR LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE THAT THIS SECTION IS TO OPERATE NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW ONE COURT IN ORANGE COUNTY HAS AN INTERPRETED SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AS PROJECTS SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM COULD NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT I COLLECTED ALL THE SYRINGES THAT IT DISTRIBUTED SUBSEQUENTLY. THE PROGRAM WAS FORCED TO SHUT DOWN. ANOTHER PROGRAM IN BUTTE COUNTY HAS BEEN FORCED TO RESEND IT CDPH APPROVED APPLICATION IN THE FACE OF SIMILAR LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY A SIMILAR LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED AGAINST A SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM IN SANTA CRUZ AND EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE MUST BE REMINDED THAT THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXPAND SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR LOOMING OPIOID PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE HAS BEEN A SHARP INCREASE IN OVERDOSE DEATHS AS EVIDENCED BY THE CDC. THE NEED FOR ACCESS TO SYRINGES AND OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED BY SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IS NOW GREATER THAN EVER. THESE TYPES OF SUITS ARE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REQUIRING SEACOR REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS IMPROPERLY PLACES DISEASE PREVENTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AT ALL IT'S- WITHOUT A MEDIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH PREVENTION SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY AUTHORIZED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WILL BE CURTAILED. AND NEW PROGRAMS WILL BE DETERRED AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN THE NEED FOR THEM IS INCREASING. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM THE RAPID SPREAD OF HIV. HEPATITIS OR ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY DEADLY OR DISABLING INFECTIONS THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGH THE SHARING OF USED NEEDLES AND SYRINGES BY PROTECTING THESE VALUABLE COMMUNITY BASED SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. I AM JOINED TODAYBY WITNESS MERRY SEE ALLAH SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE AND DR PETER DAVIDSON A UC SAN DIEGO ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES FAR WITNESSES WILL START WISHING MERRY SILVA. HI THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT- YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO PROVIDE YOUR TESTIMONY. YEAH THANK YOU GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERRY FELLOW AND SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE THE NATIONAL HARM REDUCTION COALITION. AND ASSEMBLY BILL GATES FOUNDATION. WE COME TOGETHER TO SPONSOR THE BILL TO PROTECT HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL STEVEN OVERDOSE PREVENTION IN CALIFORNIA. I HE GROUP VIEW PUBLIC PRODUCTS THANK YOU SB. I'M NOT. PLACES DID YOU PREVENT. AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ADALAT. URGE YOU TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE CLOCK AND STOPPING NEAT USED TO ATTACK PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM. BY PASSING AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE EMBERS MAY HAVE. ABOUT THE LEGAL OR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICUM BENCHES TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING I'M DOCTOR DAVIDSON I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. I'VE BEEN CONDUCTING PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH ON HANDS TO FUNCTION IN THE DRUGS FOR ALMOST TWENTY FIVE YEARS ORIGINALLY ANNA STRATTON SINCE TWO THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NEEDLE EXCHANGES A CONTROVERSIAL IDEA WHEN IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE TO HIV BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. AND SO IN THE DECADE SINCE WE'VE CONDUCTED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESEARCH TO TEST WHETHER IT TOO CHEAP TO CONTEND THE NAMES. AND TO ENSURE THAT IT WASN'T PRODUCING UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THE GO TO COMMUNITY. BECAUSE OF ALL THIS RESEARCH WE NOW KNOW THAT NEEDLE EXCHANGE DOES REDUCE HIV HEPATITIS AND OTHER BLOOD BORNE VIRUSES. I KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDLE EXCHANGE INTO DRUG TREATMENT SOONER THAN PEOPLE INTERNET ACCESS NEEDLE EXCHANGE AND ENSURE THE DRUGGIES AD CORREA'S. WE KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES WITH NEEDLE EXCHANGE HAVE LOWER RATES OF NEEDLE STICK INJURIES. WE KNOW THAT NEEDLE EXCHANGES OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE NALOXONE THE PEOPLE USE DRUGS AND THAT DOING SOIS ASSOCIATED. WITH REDUCTIONS IN OVERDOSE DEATHS. AND PARTICULARLY TO THIS COMMUNITY YEAH COMMITTEE AND SEE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH CONDUCTED TO SEE WITH THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES ON STREET JUST GOT A NEEDLE. WE NOW HAVE DECADES OF RESEARCH WHICH IS BEING DONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD WHICH CONSISTENTLY SHOWS THAT NEEDLE EXCHANGES STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN THE STREET DISCARDED NEEDLES. NOT INCREASE ITS- NEEDLE EXCHANGE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ST THIS. COULD HAVE MAILED NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM. TO GIVE THIS REASON EXAM FROM THE LITERATURE THE TWENTY ELEVEN STUDY COMPARING MIAMI AND FLORIDA WHICH DID NOT HAVE NEEDLE EXCHANGE WITH SAN FRANCISCO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAS COMPREHENSIVE NEEDLE EXCHANGE. SO THAT THEY WERE EIGHT TIMES THE NUMBER OF STREET DISCARDED NEEDLES THE THOUSAND CENSUS BLOCKS IN MIAMI COMPARED TO SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN PEOPLE USE DRUGS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDLE EXCHANGE AND REDUCE SINEAD O'CONNOR OFTEN AND WHEN THEY DISCOUNT OF MY DO SO IMPROPERLY. THEY ARE JUST MENTION RENTALS. ON THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU TO WRAP UP. YES IN THIS STUDY I JUST MENTIONED 95% OF PEOPLE USE DRUGS IN MIAMI WITH ANOTHER NEEDLE EXCHANGES RECORDED DESCRIBING THE LAST NAY LED USED ON THE STREET RIGHT THIRTY FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN IN SAN FRANCISCO. DECADES OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT NEEDLE EXCHANGES AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE ST DISCOUNTED NEEDLES I HAVE NO NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD STREAM SUPPORT STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF THEIR AUTHORIZATION ESPECIALLY IN A LOT OF THE WORK STRUGGLING WITH US CRISIS NOT STATE'S HISTORY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR- NEXT WE HAVE TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I HAVE BOB TIED KIMMEL SHOE BUTTE COUNTY SUPERVISOR. AND ROBERT BERRY FROM ROB BERRY LAW. HE JUST TAUGHT HIM SHE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WOULD LIKE TO REFER YOU TO A LETTER FROM BUTTE COUNTY. AS OF MARCH TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUTTE COUNTY OPPOSES ASSEMBLYBILL THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO EXEMPT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORIZED TO REMAIN FIXED. EXCHANGE PROGRAMS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT SEE WHAT IT WAS MORE THE ONLY TOOLS THAT CITIZENS HAVE TO SEEK- IT BERMAN BY MENTAL HARM AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE CD P. H. RECOGNIZED THE HARM. ONCE THE SYINGES USED. TO INJECT ILLICIT DRUGS THAT IS IMMEDIATELY BECOME PROHIBITED PARAPHERNALIA KNOWING THAT'S MANY USERS IMMEDIATELY DISCARD THEIR SYRINGES AFTER THEIR USE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WORK THE SUPPLY OF NEW SYRINGES. IS UNLIMITED AND FREE NEEDLE LITTER IS AN UNAVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCE OF LOOSELY REGULATED DRUG PARAPHERNALIA DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH HAVE NO REQUIREMENT TO POOR EXCHANGE USED NEEDLES FOR CLEAN ONES. WELL CDPH SEEKS. TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES THE DANGER TO THE PUBLIC REMAINS FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN MUST NOW WORRY ABOUT THE DANGERS OF POTENTIAL NEEDLE STICKS WHEN VISITING PLAYGROUNDS PARKS AND WATERWAYS. ONE OF MY ONE OF THE MOST SOLEMN OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT AT EVERY LEVEL IS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS. AND TO ENSURE THE ENVIRONMENT REMAINS PRISTINE AND LITTER FREE AS POSSIBLE. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WE BELIEVE IS UNWISE ON CONTRARY TO THE WIDELY HELD TRADITIONAL PUTTING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AT THE FOREFRONT. OF WISE PUBLIC POLICY FOR THOSE REASONS BUTTE COUNTY URGES YOU TO VOTE NO ON ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR AND AGAIN JUST. TO REITERATE DISCARDED NEEDLES ARE BARTON APARTMENT. WE NEED AND SYRINGES ARE LEADERS DISTRIBUTED IN EASY TO OBTAIN THEIR DISCARDED THOSE ITEMS NEEDLES AND SYRINGES END UP IN PARKS WATERWAYS PLAYGROUNDS IN OUR STREETS WORKING THROUGH THE STATE I THINK WHAT. WHAT PART THAT. KEEP UP YES I WILL THANK YOU WORKING TO SEE WHAT PROGRESS. OR- FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DISTRIBUTE NEEDLES IS OUR ONLY PROTECTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO- PARTICIPATE TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. MY NAME IS BRADBURY AND I'M ONE OF THE ATTORNEYS THAT BROUGHT THE LAWSUIT AND BUTTE COUNTY THAT WAS REFERRED TO EARLIER. THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THE ACCORDS EQUAL LEGISLATION IS TO FACILITATE INFORMED LAND USE DECISIONS BY IDENTIFYING ANALYZING AND MITIGATING DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS OF PROJECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN A STATE AGENCY CAN IGNORE SEQUEL ENTIRELY AS WAS THE CASE IN CHICO. NEARLY SUFFERS THE REBEL HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR SAFETY. AS A RESULT OF THIS DISREGARD FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC COMMUNITIES WE ACTUALLY AGAINST THESE PROGRAMS AS DID DID SHE GO SERVICE. INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE THEIR CONCERNS THE STATE PRECEDED UNMOVED BY PUBLIC SENTIMENT. IN RESPONSE OUR STUDENTS TO ISSUED AND THEN SETTLEMENT. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO WITHDRAW THEIR PROGRAM APPROVAL AND IN A BINDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CONCEDED THEY MUST COMPLY WITH SEQUEL FOR ALL AND ANY PROGRAMS APPROVED IN THE FUTURE. EVEN WITH THAT PROMISE EVERY CITY AND TOWNSHIP IN BUTTE COUNTY HAS NOW ENACTED LOCAL ORDINANCES WHICH BANNED SUCH PROGRAMS OUTRIGHT BY USING THEIR LAND USE POWERS TO DISALLOW THE USE AND TO DECLARE SUCH PROGRAMS A PUBLIC NUISANCE. SUCH A STRONG REACTION FROM CITIZENS IS IT REFLECTIVE OF THE HARMS THAT THEY SUFFERED. OTHER THAN WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS AS REQUIRED UNDER SPEAK WHERE THEY NOW SEEK TO PERMANENTLY OVER POWER THE WILL OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BY PURSUING EXEMPTIONS FOR THEMSELVES FOR THE VERY LAWS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED. TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT NOW AND FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THE ONLY WAY TO ESTABLISH SUSTAINABLE THIS IS SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS TO ENSURE THAT SUCH PROGRAMS ANY AGENCIES WHICH APPROVED THEM REMAIN ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PUBLIC FOR PRESENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS. THIS IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE OF SEQUELS. AND FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WE OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT ENTIRELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.

MR STONE THANK YOU THIS ARAMBULA NEW WE WE'VE CHATTED ABOUT THIS IT'S- ALTHOUGH PART OF ME SHOULD BE HEARTENED WITH THE SUPPORT WE'RE HEARING FOR SEQUEL- THE PROBLEM IS WHAT THE UNDERLYING. AND NOW THIS REALLY IS THE PROJECT AND I HAVE NOT SUPPORTED SECRET EXEMPTIONS I'VE TALKED TO MY- LOCAL ADVOCATES ABOUT THIS I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE SEQUENCE AND CHANGE EITHER BECAUSE TO ME IT'S NOT ABOUT THE UNDERLYING PROJECT. IT'S ABOUT UNDERMINING. THE LAW THAT THAT WE HAVE PUT IN IN PLACE AND I THINK THERE. OUR OTHER WAYS FOR FACILITATING NEW EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. SO I'M SORRY BUT I'M NOT SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT THAT'S WHY. MISTER WHAT THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT- I JUST YOU KNOW I I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF SEQUENCE WELL BUT I DO TAKE OFFENSE THAT SEEK WAS BEING USED TO UNDERMINE PROJECTS LIKE THIS I THINK THAT ARE IMPORTANT I WILL NOTE FOR AND- THAT LEAGUE OF CITIES REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION R. C. R. C. REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION- IT I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN CITIES ARE THERE DO YOU DOING THIS TO ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATE NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM TONIGHT I THINK THAT'S WRONG. SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. MR MCCARTY. YEAH I THINK YOU- AT FIRST I WALKED IN I THOUGHT DOCTOR WOULD THAT NOT A WE HAVE HELPED ME TO GET. IS THIS IS THIS IS A HEALTH- TOPIC I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN PART HELPED ME IN. AND LIKE IN SACRAMENTO I REMEMBER WE JUST I WAS ON THE IS IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND IT IT IT'S BEEN WORKED OUT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT ACROSS THE STREET LEVEL IN THE COUNTY THAT THEY WON'T ADOPT LITTLEST CHANGE AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF SEE BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSERVATIVE. POLITICS SO I APOLOGIZE TO THE CHERUB MISSED THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THIS PRESENTATION ARE THERE DID YOU GIVE EXAMPLES OF JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT DENIED A NEEDLE EXCHANGE FACILITY AND YOU CAN WE CAN POINT THAT SICK ONE WAS WAS WAS WAS THE ISSUE. WE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT CURRENTLY ORANGE COUNTY HAD BROUGHT A LAWSUIT FOR SEACOR WE HAD MENTIONED AS WELL ABOUT BUTTE COUNTY AND HOW SANTA CRUZ HAS A LAWSUIT WHICH. BEGAN IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO ON THE JURIST. THE THAT THE CITY OR THE COUNTY APPROVED A NEEDLE EXCHANGE FACILITY AND IT WAS BLOCKED BECAUSE OF THE SEQUEL LAWSON. IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAD APPROVED THE- SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM IN THOSE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES- WEAPONIZED SEACOR- AND ALSO HAD IF I COULD ADD A LAYER REGARDING SINCE- EARLIER WE HEARD FROM THE BUTTE. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REGARDING THEIR MARCH TWENTY THIRD LETTER BUT IT DID NOT COMMENT ON THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WE TOOK ON APRIL EIGHTH WITHIN COMMITTEE THAT BIFURCATED THIS BILL AND- ALLOWED FOR THE NUISANCE PROVISIONS TO CONTINUE AND US WE HEARD THEIR TESTIMONY STATE THAT IT WAS THE- ONLY TOOL THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND IN REALITY I BELIEVE THEY- STILL HAVE LITIGATION AND OPPORTUNITIES TO. PURSUE WHAT THE LOCALS ARE SEEKING RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANKS. MR TELL. ARE JUST A FOUGHT JUST FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO MR MCCARTHY'S THE LINE OF QUESTIONING- THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG HOW WE JUST SEEN THESE LAWSUITS- IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. THAT'S CORRECT. SHE WAS ABLE TO FIX. GIPSON OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YEAH THAT'S OKAY- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS ROOM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE OKAY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION FROM MR WEBB SECONDED BY MR MCCARTY. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I DON'T TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR BY MEMBER ARAMBULA MEMBERS RIVAS HI RIVERSIDE FLORA FLORA NO CHAU CHOW I FRIEDMAN. GARCIA MATHIS. MATHIS NO MCCARTY MCCARTY I MURATSUCHI SAY ARCHER. STONE STONE NOW WOULD WOOD I. FOUR THREE FOUR THREE I WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN THANK YOU MR ARAMBULA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NEXT UP WE HAVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN PRESENTING AB. THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX DUREX CARB TO REQUIRE ZERO EMISSIONS FROM NEW SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES. SOLD IN CALIFORNIA ON OR AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES OTHERWISE NOT A SORE OUR ENGINES THAT PRODUCE TWENTY FIVE HORSEPOWER LESS. THEY'RE MAINLY USED IN LAWN AND GARDEN EQUIPMENT SUCH AS LEAF BLOWERS AND LAWN MOWERS. AND OTHER OUTDOOR POWER EQUIPMENT. GALLON FOR GALLON THAT THESE ENGINES POLLUTE AT A SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATE THAN OTHER EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES. OPERATING A COMMERCIAL LEAF BLOWER FOR ONE HOUR IMAGE POLLUTION COMPARABLE TO DRIVING A TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TOYOTA CAMRY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED MILES. TO PUT THAT IN ANOTHER WAY ONE HOUR OF A COMMERCIAL THE FLOOR EMITS AS MUCH POLLUTION AS DRIVING A TWENTY SEVENTEEN CAMERI FROM SACRAMENTO. ACROSS NEVADA AND UTAH TO DENVER COLORADO. IN FACT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DALY EMISSIONS FROM SMALL ENGINES ARE PROJECTED TO SURPASS THOSE FROM PASSENGER CARS. BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE EMISSIONS FROM SORE WILL BE MORE THAN TWICE THOSE FROM PASSENGER CARS. THESE EMISSIONS WORSEN AIR QUALITY IN BECAUSE DIRECT NEGATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS INCLUDING ASTHMA AND LUNG DISEASE. JUST THINK ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACTS ON LANDSCAPING PROFESSIONALS WHO BREATHE IN THESE FUMES DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ZERO EMISSION VERSIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT IN THE SMALL ENGINE CATEGORY CURRENTLY REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THE CARD IS REGULATED EMISSIONS FROM THIS CATEGORY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. THIS BILL BRINGS THE EMISSION STANDARD TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE ZERO. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO ACQUIT MINORITY IN USE SO IF YOU HAVE A GAS POWERED LEAF BLOWER YOU CAN KEEP USING IT. IT ONLY BANS THE SALE OF NEW GAS POWERED STORE ON OR AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT FARMING CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ARE PREEMPTED UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT AND NOT SUBJECT TO THIS BILL OR CARD REGULATIONS. ABOUT HALF OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ALREADY SWITCHED TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. BUT IT WILL TAKE MORE TO TRANSITION COMMERCIAL OPERATORS TO ZERO EMISSIONS. TO THAT END AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX REQUIRES CARP TO MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO OFFER COMMERCIAL REBATES. TO HELP LANDSCAPERS PURCHASE ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT. SEVERAL AIR DISTRICTS LIKE SOUTH COAST IN VALLEY AIR ALREADY OFFERS SUCH REBATE PROGRAMS. AND INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE CITY OF SOUTH. PASADENA HAS SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO FULLY ZERO EMISSION LANDSCAPING. ZERO MISSION EQUIPMENT IS IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE AS GAS EQUIPMENT AND WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY OVER THE LIFE OF ITS USE. THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF GAS RICH FUEL IT'S QUIET AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN'T EMIT OZONE FORMING POLLUTANTS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT HUMAN HEALTH. THE COUNTRY TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. AND- WITH ME ARE BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND WILLIAM BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION. TESTIFYING VIA PHONE. THANK YOU. OUR MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SLICKNESS IS TRYING TO. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BILL MCGAVIN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. SMALL GASOLINE POWERED ENGINES LIKE LAWN MOWERS AND LEAF BLOWERS AND SMALL GENERATORS. HAVE BEEN REGULATED FOR YEARS BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD- BUT THOSE REGULATIONS ARE NOW OUTDATED. AND SAID YOU HEARD FROM MR BERMAN AND I'LL REPEAT THIS BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A STUNNING FACT. HE EMISSIONS FROM THESE SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES WELL ACTUALLY SURPASSED ALL THE SMOG FORMING EMISSIONS FROM CARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. AND THAT SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS THE- IT EXISTING ENGINES HAVE ALSO SHOWN HIGH FAILURE RATES IN EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS TEST. WHICH PREVENTS THE PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM BEING REALIZED SO IT'S TIME TO MOVE THE SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT IN THIS CATEGORY TWO ZERO MISSION AND THERE ARE MANY ZERO EMISSION PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THAT USE EITHER BATTERIES. OR THEY CAN PLUG IN. THE BILL IS CRAFTED TO WORK WITH THE ALREADY ONGOING REGULATORY PROCESS- WHICH I'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING AND I AND I CAN VOUCH THAT THAT PROCESS ALLOWS FOR EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. AND DELIBERATION- SO YOU MIGHT ASK THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS ALREADY GOING ON WHY DO WE NEED TO FILL. WELL EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT HAVING A STATUTORY MANDATE BRING CERTAINTY TO RULEMAKING AND- WE'VE SEEN SUCCESSES MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS DIRECTED YEAR RESOURCES BOARD. TO ENACT WILL MAKING IN A CERTAIN AREA AND GIVES THEM A STATUTORY DEADLINE. AND AT THE SAME TIME DELEGATES TO THE BOARD THE FLEXIBILITY TO SETTLE THE DETAILS AND EXAMINE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE RULE. SO WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THE BILL THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITH US IN SUPPORT PLEASE. GOOD MORNING I'M WILL BARRETT ON THE DIRECTOR. ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING. THE MISSION OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS TO SAVE LIVES BY IMPROVING LUNG HEALTH AND REDUCING LUNG DISEASE THE SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINE CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO HAVE AN INCREASINGLY LARGE ROLE IN REAL WORLD LONG HEALTH IMPACTS AND THAT THIS IMPACT WILL CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE COMING DECADE. WITHOUT ACTIONS LIKE THAT BUSINESS BILL. AMONG SUCH PATIENTS TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATED AIR REPORT. RELEASED LAST WEEK FOUND THAT SEVEN OF THE TEN MOST OZONE POLLUTED CITIES. IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS IN NEED COMMUNITIES CAN EXPERIENCE NEARLY A MONTH TO OVER FIVE MONTHS OF UNHEALTHY AIR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION CAN HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES INCLUDING ASTHMA ATTACKS. HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES LUNG CANCER AND PREMATURE DEATH. CHILDREN OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS- ESPECIALLY HEART AND LUNG DISEASES. ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION. OUTDOOR WORKERS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PEOPLE OF COLOR ALSO FACE GREATER RISKS AND OFTEN FACE DISPROPORTIONATE EXPOSURES TO UNHEALTHY AIR. AND THEIR ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE-HEALTH OUTCOMES. THAT CALIFORNIA'S POLICIES HAVE REALLY SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING DOWN REGIONAL AIR POLLUTION. WE KNOW THAT THE INVENTORY OF POLLUTION SOURCES WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT. THAT THOSE HARD FOUGHT POLICIES- HAVE TAKEN EFFECT. AND CLEAN UP OTHER SECTORS. AT- EIGHT THIRTY FORTY SIX REALLY READ. THE GROWING OF THE SORT. WHAT A LONG HELD AND RECALL CAR TO DIE- THE TOP COST. AND FEASIBLE REGULATE. REALLY REFLECTING THE WIDESPREAD AVAILABILITY AND ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES TODAY. AND THEN- TO YOU KNOW MOVES FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT- CARBS IDENTIFYING AND THAT RING TO MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL TRANSITION. FOR NEW ENGINES TO MOVE TO ZERO EMISSIONS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU ADDRESSES THE GROWING THREAT TO LONG HEALTH AND WE URGE DR BODEN THANK THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONE LINES. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PHONE YES PLEASE ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT ON THE PHONE LINES PLEASE.

AB THIRTEEN FORTY SECOND CARDS RECENT PARALLEL POTENTIAL RULE POSE NUMEROUS TECHNOLOGY FEASIBILITY ECONOMIC AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES FOR INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS COLLECTIVELY THESE CHALLENGES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE AND WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIPS FOR MANUFACTURERS RETAILERS AND END USERS CULMINATING IN EARLY MARKETS SHORTFALL OF PRODUCTS WITH HIGH CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL NEED AND DEMAND.

SEE NOBODY IN SUPPORT OF VIDEO TESTIMONY WILL GO BACK OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX. IN THE CHAMBER. SCENE NINE SEE KNOWN IN OPPOSITE- WE'LL SEE NO OPPOSITION IN THE COMMITTEE ROOMS WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I WAS REGARDING THE MISTER WOULD. THANK YOU THAT FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION ON THIS BILL. I JUST WANT TO- TALK TO THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT HE'S THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND WAS VERY DELIBERATE AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND THAT THIS WAS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL WHEN I WHEN THIS WAS PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I REMEMBER THAT. IT WAS THAT A DEBATE WERE ON THE FLOOR OF ONE OF THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S OF THE TIME MISTER CAR DOES NOT CONGRESS MEMBER I REMEMBER HE BROKE DOWN IN TEARS. TALKING ABOUT HOW HIS DAD- WAS A- A GARDENER AND HE WAS GONNA HAVE HIS TOOLS ESSENTIALLY TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED THEM. ON DAY ONE AND SO WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE IS VERY DIFFERENT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE INDUSTRY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS- SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS THAT AND REASONABLE I KNOW THERE WAS LATE OPPOSITION THAT CAME I THINK JUST TWO DAYS AGO YESTERDAY SO- WE HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD FROM PEOPLE THE OUTCRY LIKE WE DID TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. AND JUST THIS WEEKEND I WAS IN THE HOME DEPOT STORE AND I KNEW ABOUT THIS BILL AND I WAS LOOKING ON THE SHELF. AND THE PRICE OF THESE- ELECTRIC BLOWERS HAS GONE DOWN AND WE'RE MAINLY TALKING ABOUT BLOWERS I KNOW. THERE'S CHAINSAWS AND LAWNMOWERS AND OPENNESS TO WOOD TALKS ABOUT CHAINSAWS A LOT UP IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHICH ARE NEEDED BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES BUT- THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE FACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THE LEAF BLOWERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AN THAT'S WHAT IMPACTS. AND NEIGHBORHOODS THE QUALITY OF LIFE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE HEALTH OF THE WORKERS. THEY TWO THINGS. ONE I SAW THIS ON THE SHELF IN IN HOME DEPOT THE POWER OF THESE LEAF BLOWERS HAS GONE UP TREATMENT YOU'RE TREMENDOUSLY I THINK IT'S THE CF AT WHATEVER THE HORSEPOWER WHAT HAVE YOU. AND I AND I I'M A ROBOT ONE ABOUT A YEAR AGO WAS LIKE WELL THIS IS ALMOST LIKE A GAS CARD ONE AND- THE PRICE WAS NOT THAT MUCH WHAT'S THE PRICE IS MUCH LOWER THAN A GAS WANTS TO BE LOOK AT BUYING ONE OF THESE PLUS BUYING AN EXTRA BATTERY PACK OR TWO. IT'S ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT OF THE COST FOR- AND- I GUESS ONE AND YOU WANT WITH THE GAS ONE YOU'RE PAYING GAS OF COURSE HERE YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR GAS YOU SAVE MONEY AND HAVE THE ELECTRIC BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE QUALITY AND I'M UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THERE IS SOME TYPE OF A REBATE PROGRAM THAT CARP YOU TALK ABOUT THAT ONE YET SO WHAT WHAT WE DO- WHAT THE BILL DOES IS- THE ME FIND THE DETAILS- SO REQUIRED. CARD TO MAKE FUNDING OF A- SO DISTRICTS RAMP UP COMMERCIAL REBATE PROGRAMS TO HELP BUSINESSES TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION EQUIPMENT- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- IN THE BILL THAT ISN'T. IN CARBS PROPOSED REGULATION SO THAT'S SOMETHING UNIQUE TO THE BILL AND WHY THE BILL IS SO IMPORTANT- AND WHAT THAT IS UPDATING SOME OF THE- REBATE PROGRAMS THAT CARD HAS. TO ALLOW FOR MORE USES INCLUDING A LOT OF THESE GAS. ELECTRIC POWERED STORE. EQUIPMENT THAT CURRENTLY ISN'T. IT DOESN'T QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN REBATE PROGRAMS AND THE CALL MORE YOUR PROGRAM- UNDER CARBS SO. SOMEWHERE DISTRICTS IN THE BIGGEST OR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. CENTRAL VALLEY- THE LA THE SOUTH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- DISTRICT ALREADY PROVIDE STRONG REBATE PROGRAMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE. AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL USE WE WANT THEM ALL. TO PROVIDE A STRONG REBATE PROGRAMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AND SO THAT'S THE FOCUS OF THE BILL. YEAH BUT THAT I THINK ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE THERE- TO ADDRESS WE'RE AT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK IT'S TIME SO THANK YOU. PRESIDENT THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THE INTENSE LOOK I HAVE A- ELECTRIC LAWNMOWER HAVE AN ELECTRIC LEAF BLOWER HAVE AN ELECTRIC CAR SO- CLEARLY I UNDERSTAND- THE CONCERN AROUND EMISSIONS- I DO- WONDER. THESE REBATE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR. I GUESS YOU'RE THE BILL'S GOING TO COMMAND- CARD TO DO THIS- WILL THAT BE HOW THOSE BE DONE WILL THAT BE SUBJECT TO- THE ENVIRO SKIN. WHERE WHERE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE GOOD AIR QUALITY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS- OR- OR IS THIS GOING TO BE. A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. AND WILL THERE BE LIMITED FUNDING. OVER THE B. A LOT OF FUNDING. BECAUSE I WORRY- BUT IN IN MY DISTRICT- CHAINSAWS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WAY OF LIFE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS WE'RE WE'RE MANDATING- WE'RE NOT MANDATING WORSE WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO MORE HOME HARDENING- AND- TAKE CARE. THAT DEPRESSION VEGETATION THEIR HOME AND- I WILL SAY THAT WELL I DO ENJOY MY ELECTRIC LAWN MORE MY LOGICALLY BLOWER- THE CHALLENGE IN SOME AREAS IS GOING TO BE RE CHARGING THOSE. BATTERIES ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A COMMERCIAL OPERATOR I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES AND THE DAY UNLESS YOU HAVE. YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF BATTERIES- TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO. SO FIRST QUESTION IS. WILL WILL OF THESE REBATES BE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE FOR- NOT JUST COMMERCIAL BUT- CONSUMERS'S WELL. WHEN WILL THEY BE SUBJECTED TO THE ENVIRO CARE- AND THEN SECONDLY- ARE THERE ARE YOU LOOKING AT WOULD YOU CONSIDER ANY SORT. OF- RURAL CO CONSIDER. FOR THIS I UNDER LOOK I AROUND THE CAPITAL HERE IN THE MORNINGS AND- AND I HATE THOSE LEAF BLOWERS MAN I JUST HATE THEM I HATE THE DUST THEY PUT UP AND I HATE THE EMISSIONS AND I THINK. I WORRY ABOUT THE WORKERS. BUT I LIVE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD. SO I HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE CALAVERAS SCREEN COMPONENT BECAUSE I'M NOT I'M NOT THAT INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH WITH WHETHER YOU KNOW IT IS THE APPLICATION OF THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT MOST THESE REBATE PROGRAMS FALL UNDER THE DIFFERENT AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS- THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS SO- BUT AB THIRTEEN FORTY SIX MAKES INCENTIVE FUNDING AVAILABLE BY REQUIRING CARP TO UPDATE FUNDING GUIDELINES. FOR APPLICABLE PROGRAMS TO SEVERAL LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS OFFER ROBUST COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL REBATE PROGRAMS FOR LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT BUT WE WANT TO BUILD ON THAT PROGRESS BY REMOVING BARRIERS THAT RESTRICT LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS ABILITY TO FIND INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO LIKE I MENTIONED A SECOND AGO. THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM FUNDING GUIDELINES ARE RESTRICTIVE AND OUTDATED CURRENTLY ONLY LAWN MOWERS FOR RESIDENTIAL USE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING IT'S ABOUT REQUIRING CARD TO UPDATE THESE GUIDELINES TO INCLUDE COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR SMALL FOR SORE. THIS WILL FREE UP FUNDING FOR AIR DISTRICTS TO OFFER AND EXPAND COMMERCIAL REBATE PROGRAMS. TO HELP LANDSCAPING PROFESSIONALS. THIS IS YOUR OMISSION. SO I CAN GET YOU A LOT MORE INFORMATION. KIND OF. POST POST HEARING ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND WHETHER OR NOT. CALAVERAS CAN APPLIES I'D SIMILAR YOU HAVE. CONCERNS ABOUT CALAVERAS SCREEN. AND ITS IMPACT IN MY DISTRICT- BUT- YEAH THIS IS THIS REALLY DOES. YOU WITH THE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE LOOK A LOT MORE FUNDING FOR THESE REBATE REBATE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE A LOT OF- YOUR DISTRICTS ALREADY HAVE THE FUNDING ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE- THE REBATE PROGRAMS ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE. AND THEN I DON'T KNOW IF I ANSWERED ALL YOUR QUESTION I GUESS AND THEN JUST THE ONE ABOUT ONE OTHER ONE AND LOOK I'M I'M I'M NOT GONNA I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY WITHOUT THAT BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THAT LACK OF INFORMATION BUT- BUT ALSO- WE HAVE A LARGE- ROBUST TIMBER INDUSTRY IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY RELY ON THESE MOTORS TO- FOR LARGE SCALE- FOR LARGE SCALE CHAINSAWS AS PART OF. NOT JUST TO CUT THE TREES DOWN BUT ALSO TO LIMB THEM UP AND SO ON SO- I EIGHT IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE IF YOU'RE OUT IN THE FOREST WHICH MIGHT BE TEN MILES OFF OF A ROAD SOMEWHERE- DOES THIS BILL APPLY TO THOSE THOSE- THOSE BUSINESSES AS WELL IT WILL IT FOR CHAINSAWS- CHAINSAWS OVER OR FORTY FIVE CC ARE. PREEMPTED AND SO I THINK A LOT OF THE CHAIN SAWS ARE USED IN THE TIMBER INDUSTRY OR MUCH MORE HEAVY DUTY. CHAIN SAWS WHERE THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO THEM FOR THE SMALLER CHAIN SAWS IT IT WOULD- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH IF YOU BUY AN ELECTRIC CHAINSAW PLUS ADDITIONAL BATTERIES TO GET YOU THROUGH THE DAY. OVER THE LONG RUN YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY ON BUYING A GAS POWERED CHAINSAW HAVING TO USE GAS CONSTANTLY THOSE CHAINS AUGUST MARCHING SILVA THE END AND GUESTS ARTICLE IN BREAK DOWN MORE OFTEN. YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW THE MAINTENANCE ON THEM- SO YEAH IT WOULD APPLY TO CHAIN SAWS UNDER FORTY FIVE CC THE SMALLER CHAINSAWS NOT FOR AND I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. NOT FOR FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT. THAT IS ALL COMPLETELY EXEMPTED- BUT FOR THE TIMBER INDUSTRY WHAT- SO ALL. SIX EQUIPMENT LIKE LIKE LIKE YOU KNOW CAL- FOLKS HAVE TO REMOVE TREES AFTER A STORM THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL. OR JUST FIRE FIGHTING- YEAH I DO MY NOTES SAY FOR SAFETY PURPOSES- BY GROUPS LIKE CALIFORNIA'S ALL TO CHECK IN ON CALTRANS AND OTHER YOUNG YEAH THE DEPARTMENT- BUT LIKE I SAID I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOR SURE ALSO ALSO WILL SAY WE ALSO POWER SAFETY SHUT OFF PROBLEMS IN MY DISTRICT SO THAT'S A PROBLEM TO RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE POWER AS A MUCH BIGGER BILL I'M LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORTING YOUR BILL WHEN YOU WHEN YOU TACKLE THAT THANK YOU MR BERMAN THINGS DOCTOR WOULD. MISTER THANK YOU MR CHAIR- EIGHT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO WITH THIS BUT- ON ME. THANK YOU ANA A LITTLE HISTORY TRIP OF A LUXURY NOT MY GROWING UP BRIGITTE THAT SO I GREW UP THE PICTURES IN IN THE MOUNTAINS WELL FOUR THOUSAND FEET MY FIRST JOB WAS PUTTING UP THE A SIGN ON THE MAILBOX SAYING YOU KNOW ALL ALL HELP CLEAR PROPERTIES WILL CUT FIRE LINES WILL DO THIS SO. MY FIRST JOB WAS USING THIS EQUIPMENT. A LITTLE HONDA ONE TEN THREE WHEELER WITH A TRAILER ON THE BACK. WITH WITH MY BLOWER AND MY CHAIN SAW IN THE WEEDEATER AND MEANING TOOLS AND EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF THEY THE YOU WOULD NEED. TO BE OUT ON THE COUNTRY SIDE CLEAR FIRE LINE. TO TAKE CARE OF A FARMER RANCH WITH WHATEVER. I CAN DO TO MAKE A BUCK THIS IS A TEENAGER. THERE IS NO WAY. THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. UNDER YOUR BILL. I WOULD HAVE TO CARRY A GENERATOR AROUND WITH ME TO CONSTANTLY CHARGE THESE BATTERIES IS IT AS I WENT ALONG. BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY ALL THESE PLUS AS THEY SET OUT IN THE SUN THE BATTERIES WEAR OUT ANYWAY. SO YOU HAVE THAT. MY OTHER CONCERN ON ON ON THE NATIONAL RESOURCES IN ON THIS IN AN EXPRESSION OF OUR- MIDDLING. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE. EXTRA ADDED BATTERIES IS THE DEPLETE NAGEL THAT. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH. THE THIS EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THE LIFESPAN ON A BATTERY OPERATED ANYTHING- THEY THEY TEND TO BURN OUT QUICKER THEY DON'T LAST AS LONG I STILL HAVE SOME OF THE WE TWO YEARS I HAD. TWENTY YEARS AGO. THAT ARE UP AND RUNNING. SO THEY'RE NOT ENDING UP IN A IN A LANDFILL OR DUMP OR SOMEWHERE ELSE SOMEWHERE. THAT THEY'RE STILL UP AND RUNNING. SO I UNDERSTAND THE SHORT LIFESPAN. ISSUE WITH THE FEW AMENDMENTS AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT BUT WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE SHORE SIDEDNESS OF THESE THINGS. ESPECIALLY ON ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE LIFESPAN. HOW LONG IS THIS PRODUCT GOING TO LAST. IS IT A FIVE YEAR PRODUCT IN THIS IS BURNED OUT I GOTTA GO BUY ANOTHER ONE. AND ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE AND ANOTHER ONE IN THE IN THESE GUYS OVER HERE GET RICH. SELLING GREEN ENERGY BLOWERS. OR DO I BUY THAT HEARTY. TWO STROKE THIS GOING TO LAST ME THIRTY YEARS. IN IN IN I KNOW THAT PRODUCT'S GOING TO LAST I KNOW IT'S GOING TO DO THE JOB AND I KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO BRING THE ENGINE SO THAT THOSE ARE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE I HAVE TO A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS DR WHAT'S- WITH MY RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO GET THE POWER OUTAGES TO GET THE ROLLING BLACKOUTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE OTHER THINGS. NOW THIS FOR THIS PROGRAM MY WORK GREAT IN THE CITY. BUT THE AIR QUALITY IS ALSO DIFFERENT IN IN YOUR BILL- TO DIVE A LITTLE MORE INTO DOCTOR WHICH QUESTIONS. IF YOUR AIR DISTRICTS GOOD YOUR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS. AND FRANKLY A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THINGS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED LIKE KARL MOYER IN THESE OTHER THINGS I KNOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE I WORKED WITH GOVERNOR BROWN. WHEN WE RE DID CAP AND TRADE TO ENSURE FUNDING FOR KARL MOYER IN THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE ALREADY SHORT ON FUNDS. SO WE HAVE THESE BIGGER MORE LARGE SCALE THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GONNA CARRY MORE WEIGHT. IN WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOOD WITH OUR CARBON.NEUTRAL GOALS. IN FRANKLY I. GET WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO MAN. BUT BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST IT'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH THING. IT'S GOING TO CAUSE A LOT OF EXTRA ADMINISTRATIVE WORK. OF AND SUCK UP A LOT MORE FUNDS THAN IT'S GOING TO BE WORTH. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT BIGGER PICTURE THANKS IF WE'RE GONNA GET OUR STATE TO MORE CARBON NEUTRAL AREA. IN IN WE'VE GOT A LOOK AT THE LIFESPAN OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY EASY TO THINK LIKE OKAY WE'RE GONNA. TAKE ALL THESE LITTLE ENGINES OUT. COOL WHERE DID THEY GET IN UP IN A LANDFILL AND THEY'RE GONNA DEEPLY THE GROUNDWATER AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS. SO INTEL WE CAN. LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE AND LOOK AT SOMETHING BIGGER PICTURE THAN JUST A SMALL ENGINE I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS. BUT IT BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS I REGRET NOT HAVING TAKING NOTES- LET ME TRY TO. ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THOSE POINTS OF VERSES AS MUCH AS YOU AND I. LIKE TO FEEL LIKE WE'RE VERY YOUNG- WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OLDER. AND THE TECHNOLOGIES CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE OUT THERE ON THE RIDGE- WITH YOUR WITH YOUR THREE WHEELER AND THE TRAILER WITH THIS EQUIPMENT AND THE EQUIPMENT IS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY- AND MISTER BERMAN I'M I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT BECAUSE I'M ALSO ONE OF TWO MEMBERS OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY THAT TOOK THE TIME. TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY SCHOOL FOR LEGISLATORS. AND I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU ON THAT LIST SO I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND- I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT COMMITMENT MY FRIEND. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT ON BEHALF OF THE OTHER HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN OF US. THE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THE FARM EQUIPMENT. CONSTRUCTION AND FARM EQUIPMENT IS FEDERALLY PREEMPTED. IT'S SO IT'S SO THAT- YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD THAT SHOULD HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE. IF YOU BY LIKE YOU SAID I THINK A CHAINSAW THAT'S GONNA LAST THIRTY YEARS. YOU CAN KEEP USING IT FOR THIRTY YEARS. MY BILL DOES NOT BAN YOU FROM USING ANY GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT. THAT YOU BUY BEFORE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR AFTER ONCE CARBON. MAKES THE REGULATIONS- SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT THAN A TWENTY TWENTY THREE. YOU CAN STOCK UP AND USE THAT STUFF UNTIL UNTIL YOU'RE WELL INTO YOUR RETIREMENT YEARS- THAT YOU CAN. TAKE THE BATTERIES BACK TO. I MEAN YOU. LIKE OR A- BIT. LIKE HOME D. FOR A PSYCH. OF THE BATTERIES YOU MENTIONED. I HOPE BONTA BUNCH OF PEOPLE MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. THE SAME COMPANIES THAT MAKE THE GAS POWERED EQUIPMENT ALSO MAKE THE ELECTRIC POWERED EQUIPMENT SO IT'S THE SAME COMPANIES- WHETHER YOU BOUGHT A GAS POWERED OR THE ELECTRIC- BUT I PUT IT IN AND YOU KIND OF TRY TO MINIMIZE. THE IMPACT OF STORE EMISSIONS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK. I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU ABOUT EXACTLY HOW BIG OF AN IMPACT THIS IS- LIKE I MENTIONED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DALY EMISSIONS FROM STORE ARE PROJECTED TO SURPASS. THOSE FROM PASSENGER CARS. I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL ON SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS- YOU TALK ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THINGS. I THINK THERE'S NO BIGGER LONG TERM IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AN THEN AND THEN TO REDUCE THESE A MISS- FOR THE FUTURE. SO I YOU AND I HAVE A FOR. DISAGREE ON SOME OF THESE. I THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RAISED I'LL TRY TO WORK WITH YOU. TO ADDRESS THEM HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE THINGS I SAID. ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE- BUT I RESPECT WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM THAT YOU PROBABLY WANT IT WOULDN'T GO ANY TO. TAKE ON SOME BIGGER CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES LET LET ME NOW I WILL I APPRECIATE THAT IMITATION THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER. AND WELL WE WENT ON THAT JOURNEY WITH DEVON HELLO GOOD JOURNEY THROUGH HIS CHILDHOOD- I WAS I ONE SIMPLE. AND WE WENT BACK ALREADY- WHERE IS THE FUNDING COMING FROM AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE A FEW OF US THAT ARE ARE FIERCELY PROTECTIVE OF SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE- WE GOT THIS NOT KICKED OUT OF THIS BECAUSE WE SUPPORTED FORMER PROGRAM YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS IT RELATES TO LARGER HORSEPOWER ENGINES. WHERE IS THE FUNDING COMING FROM AND OUT OF WHAT BUCKET IS IT COMING FROM. BUT THAT'S ALL THE LIKE YEAH SO HOLES ARE GOING TO GO FIND THAT. THIS AGAIN BILL BUT A MESS APPEAR. ON THAT JOURNEY- WHICH. ONE WITH US FOR PUTTING ON THE SPOT NO NO NO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION- THAT I JUST. KIND OF GOT. LOST IN ALL MY NOTED HERE- I'M THE FUNDING IS COMING FROM DIFFERENT REBATE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT THAT ALREADY EXIST- SO I MEAN I THINK TO GET TO THE CRUX OF YOUR QUESTION- YEAH THAT'S THE THERE THERE'S- REBATE PROGRAMS. UNDER CARBON OF THE DEVON AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS- AND THAT'S WHAT THE PHONE WILL COME FROM OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANKS. AND I'LL GET BACK TO WITH WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THAT. MISTER SERRA. THANK YOU. ARE SO I THINK OF YOU HAVE HEARD FROM- THE COLLECTION OF. ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE- DIFFERENT AREAS HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND- CITIES OUT IN RURAL AREAS HAVE MUCH DIFFERENT- ENVIRONMENTS- THEN THEY DO AND ABILITIES TO TRYING UC'S EQUIPMENT- I MYSELF HAVE A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE AND SOMETIMES ONE PIECE OF COURT AND THAT'S WORK I SWITCHED TO THE OTHER ONE- I GO THROUGH BAD. A LOT WHICH CONCERNS ME. AND BUT YOU KNOWONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW EXISTS TODAY. IS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES COMMUNITY CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES. HAVE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE THESE IF THEY WANT. AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY MORE OF A LOCAL CONTROL THING THAT I THINK LOCAL LOCALITIES SHOULD DETERMINE- WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR AREA WHAT WORKS FOR THEIR WORKERS. AND YOU KNOW AND ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW AS WE DROP THE EMISSIONS ON CARS YES INDIVIDUALLY THE CARS WILL BE SO LOW THAT ANYTHING ELSE AND IT PRODUCES ANYTHING WILL BE HIGHER. AND AND SO- YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE BUT THIS WITH THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION- WE ALL WANT CLEAN AIR- BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT. OF LIVELIHOODS THAT DEPEND ON THIS THAT. THEY CAN BE IN. SO- THAT THOSE ARE MY- OKAY. THAT AND I USED TO SERVE ON A CITY COUNCIL PALO ALTO WITH THAT BAND- GAS POWERED LEAF BLOWERS IN IT I DID TALK TO. THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. BECAUSE I'M NOT TRYING TO BAN THE USE. YOU KNOW COME A CERTAIN DATE I'M SAYING LET'S BAN THE SALE OF NEW ONES- BUT BUTI APPRECIATE THE POINT ON THE LOCAL CONTROL- FRONT AND- YOU KNOW IS. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CRAFT A BILL THAT NEW WANTS ENOUGH TO ADDRESS ALL THE DIFFERENT- YOU KNOW REGIONS IN THE POLICIES OF CALIFORNIA BUT BUT UNDERSTAND THAT. CONCERNS EXIST PROJECT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY I'D LIKE TO- THANK YOU AND THE OTHER AUTHORS OF THIS LEGISLATION FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- TO ADDRESS WHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE ISSUE IMPACTING AIR QUALITY YEAH THE SMALL AND JUST SMALL ENGINES ARE WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR EMISSIONS AND NOISE POLLUTION WHILE I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY- I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS A REGARDING COMMERCIAL APPLICATION. OF YOU KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WANT TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO MAKE A LIVING YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF LANDSCAPERS AND GARDENERS THAT LIVE IN MY DISTRICT THAT USE LAWN EQUIPMENT- AND YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY COULD NOT AFFORD ON THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND SO I KNOW WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE ABOUT FINDING A FUNDING SOURCE I'M AND I YOU HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT. WILL BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY OVER SUBSCRIBED AND SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE- ALSO YOU KNOW BATTERY TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT CHALLENGING YOU KNOW FOR ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES- TO STOCK UP AND ON MULTIPLE %TERIES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THEM THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO DO THEIR WORK- I KNOW IN LOS ANGELES A LOT OF OUR LANDSCAPERS MOVE FROM- MULTIPLE HOMES IN ONE DAY ALL ACROSS THE CITY. RIGHT YOU KNOW IN IN THIS AREA IN THIS LARGE AREA I'M AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL BE CONTINUING. AND ABLE DO THEIR WORK YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST PROVIDE DOING THIS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES HELLO THANK YOU FOR- COMMITTEE INTO THAT. OKAY THAT- MADAM CHAIR AND THE- YEAH PRESERVE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD AND I TRIED TO HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS BEFORE YOU WERE INTRODUCED THE BILL BECAUSE I KNEW THE SENSITIVITIES. HISTORIC SENSITIVITIES THAT THAT MR MCCARTY RAISED AND IT IS. YOUR CONSTITUENTS IT IS YEAH THE LANDSCAPE WORKERS AND GARDENERS THAT I'M TRYING TO LOOK OUT FOR. BECAUSE CURRENTLY HAVING GAS POWER MACHINES ON THEIR BACKS EIGHT TO TEN HOURS A DAY. SPEWING FUMES RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR NOSE IN THEIR MOUTH. IS DAN- AND WE NEED TO MOVE IN A HEALTHIER DIRECTION. FOR THEM I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU- THAT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKES THAT IT'S- FOR- SO YEAH THAT'S GOING TO A BIGGER THAT WE'RE TO CONTINUE.

THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB THIRTEEN NINETY WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES FOR RETIRED TEACHERS AND FACILITATE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT ON SCHOOL LANDS SCHOOL LANDS ARE LANDS THAT ARE GRANTED TO THE STATE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GENERATE REVENUE THE BENEFIT SCHOOLS THE SCHOOL ANSWER DIFFICULT TO MANAGE OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE BROKEN UP INTO NON CONTIGUOUS SQUARE MILE PARCELS. BECAUSE CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOL PARCELS INTO CONTIGUOUS HOLDINGS IS MORE EFFECTIVE EXISTING LAW AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO SELL ISOLATED NON ECONOMIC SCHOOL AND USE THE FUNDS FROM THE SALES TO PURCHASE READ A REAL PROPERTY THAT WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES THE PROBLEM UNDER EXISTING LAW IS THAT THE COMMISSION IS CONSTRAINED BY THE EXISTING 5% CAP USE THE FUNDS TO PAY ANCILLARY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAND PURCHASES. IN ADDITION IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THIRD PARTY COSTS ARE FOR SPECIFIC SEAL IN THE COMMISSION CANNOT MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON A LAND PURCHASE ON A TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO AB THIRTEEN NINETY CLARIFIES THAT THE COMMISSION CAMPAIGN BETWEEN LAND ACQUISITION COSTS AND REMOVES THE 5% CAP ON THESE EXPENSES THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE COMMISSION TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT FOR POTENTIAL LAND ACQUISITIONS AND BEYOND THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.

THE STATE HAD BORROWED MOST OF THAT MONEY IN RECENT YEARS- BUT RECENTLY REPAID WITH INTEREST AND MARK PURSUING AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY ON THE PART OF THAT PROCESS WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO THAT FOR THE BILL SIMPLY REMOVES THOSE CONSTRAINTS AND IMPROVE THE COMMISSION COMPETITIVENESS IN THE MARKET.

I HAVE TO HOPE I CAN DO ONE. THANK THINK MAN CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER HEARING THE BILL AND INDICATE THAT I ALSO WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE OUR STATE HAS LED THE WAY AN AGGRESSIVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHILE EXPANDING OUR ECONOMY TO BE THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD. ALTHOUGH THIS TEST THERE HAS BEEN GREAT PROGRESS THERE IS MORE AND MORE EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT OUR INVESTMENTS TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE ARE NOT GOING TO THE COMMUNITIES WHERE FUND. THING IS MOST NEEDED. EIGHT JUNE TWENTY TEN TWENTY REPORT AUTHORED BY THE STAFF AND YOU. CENTER FOR SIXTEEN COMMUNITIES. THE STRUCTURE OF A CLAIM INVESTMENT. IS SKEWED TO. THE MOST AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. THIS HAS COME TO THE X. AT THE EXPENSE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ABILITY OR RESOURCES TO ACCESSING EXISTING PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES. FOLDABLE COMMITTEE ARE BEING BY THE WAYSIDE AS OUR STATE ADDRESSES CLIMATE CHANGE. AB SIXTY EIGHTY HIT HELPS TO BRIDGE THAT GAP BY IMPLEMENTING KEY POLICIES RECOMMENDED IN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S RECENT REPORT. PUTTING ALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD I JOBS IN CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY REQUIRED GIGI R. F. APPLICANTS TO USE FAIR AND RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYER STANDARDS TO PROMOTE HIGH QUALITY JOBS. INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT POLICIES TO MAKE SURE APPLICANTS ARE CONTRACTING WITH OTHER RESPONSIBLE ENTITIES AND PREVAILING WAGE FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THE BILL WOULD FURTHER PRIORITIZE APPLICANTS THAT PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT TARGET RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED TRIBAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THE SAME REGION ASK THE PROJECT. THESE PROVISIONS WHICH ARE JUST A FEW OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS PROPOSED BY C. W. D. B.'S HI REPORT WILL PUT PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY ON THE FRONT END OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS RATHER THAN AN AFTERTHOUGHT. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB EIGHTY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH NEED THAT THESE CLIMATE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND. THANK YOU- WE DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES REGISTERED. IN SUPPORT WE HAVE ONE IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE RICHARD MARCUSSEN FROM THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. MODERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINE FOR THE WITNESS. THANK YOU YOUR LINE IS OPEN. A GOOD MORNING A CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS RICHARD MARCUSSEN FOR THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WITH HIS OPPOSITION IS LIMITED TO A SINGLE SENTENCE IN THE BILL IT'S ON PAGE FOUR AT LINE THIRTY ONE IT REQUIRES THAT A CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS- PURSUED UNDER THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND PROGRAM I HAVE TO HAVE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT. INCLUDED IN THEM THE STATE AUDITOR MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S USE OF CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS TO MAXIMIZE THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE BUT NOWHERE IN THE REPORT WAS THERE ANY MENTION. THAT A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WOULD IMPROVE THE PROGRAM'S EFFICACY THERE ARE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES WHO RECEIVED OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROCEEDS FROM. CAP AND TRADE SINCE IT WAS INITIATED- THE STATE REPORT. THAT THE STATE REPORTS THAT OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION. AND WELL LIGHTED THE STATE CLIMATE INVESTMENTS OR A OR B. WEBSITES BREAK DOWN HOW MUCH OF THE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS GREATER THAN A MILLION DOLLARS. YOU CAN EASILY ENVISION HOW THE REQUIREMENT FOR PLA'S. WILL ADD SUBSTANTIAL BURDEN. BOTH TO THE STATE AGENCIES WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE FUNDS. BUT ALSO TO THE GRANT RECIPIENTS TO NEGOTIATE AND EXECUTE A P. L. A. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS. FURTHERMORE STUDIES OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION HAVE SHOWN THE PLA'S AND 15218% TO THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. MEANING THE SINGLE SENTENCE IN AB SIX EIGHTY IS CURRENTLY CRAFTED WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF WORK TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF GREENHOUSE GAS. THAT HAS ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS REASON A WEEK IS SUPPOSED. UNLESS AMENDED TO A. B. SIX EIGHTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BUT THIS WILL BE A PLAN DRAFT BEING NEXT YEAR AND THE HEALTH COMMUNITIES LIKE MY COMPANY BEING COMPROMISED. BECAUSE OF OUR QUALITY AND GHG EMISSIONS THIS LEGISLATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED. EVER TRULY CARE ABOUT ADDRESSING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM AND ALL ASPECTS OF SOCIETY. AND PRIORITIZING OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH IMPACT ON THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY KNOWING THAT ALLOWS US TO.

I AM A PHYSICIAN ADVISER ON CLIMATE AND HEALTH EQUITY FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE I WAS PREVIOUSLY A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN ONE THREE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS NOW DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WE NEED AMBITIOUS CLIMATE ACTION TO AVERT CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE HEALTH IMPACTS BUT THE SCOPING PLAN AS A VITAL PLAN TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH. OUR TRANSPORTATION LAND USE ENERGY FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND BUILDING SYSTEMS ARE RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT ALSO FOR THE PERSISTENT HEALTH INEQUITIES THAT PLAGUE EVERY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. WAITING FOR THOUSANDS OF PREMATURE DEATHS IN LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IF CREATED WISELY THE POLICIES WE ENACT TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE PRESENT GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND REDUCE HEALTH INEQUITIES GREEN CARDS AND CLEAN ENERGY REDUCE AIR POLLUTION HEART DISEASE AND LUNG DISEASE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION REDUCES CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES. URBAN FORESTRY REDUCE OF HEAT ILLNESS AND IMPROVES WATER QUALITY BUT SOME CLIMATE POLICIES CAN WORSEN HELP POORLY DONE HOME WEATHERIZATION CAN WORSEN INDOOR AIR QUALITY CAP AND TRADE CAN PERPETUATE UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH INEQUITIES. CALIFORNIANS WILL SPEND A LOT OF MONEY TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE INCORPORATING A BETTER HEALTH ANALYSIS INTO DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCOPING PLAN WILL PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE INVESTMENT OPTIMIZED HEALTH BENEFITS AND MINIMIZE HEALTH RISKS. ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. CDPH WE HOW IN A OR B. TO IN AND FRAME FOR YOU IN A KIND. HEALTH AND NOW. AND IS PURPOSE MUCH PROVIDE MUCH FOR TO A RP FOR AND I. YEAH A. R. B.

GOOD MORNING I'M WILL THERE AT THE DIRECTOR OF CLEAN AIR ADVOCACY WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA ALSO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT IN FOLLOWING DR RUDOLPH COMMENT I WOULD START BY NOTING THAT I'M MORE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH EVALUATION OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND MEASURES THAT FOLLOWS COKING PLANT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE AMERICAN LUNG SAID AND MANY OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS. WOULD YOU THE UPCOMING SCOPING PLAN AS A CRITICAL EFFORT TO CHART CALIFORNIA'S COURTS RAPIDLY AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS WILL BE ENGAGING WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS AND SHARE THE AGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH FOCUSED MISSION THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE SCOPING PLANTED THE MAJOR TOUCH POINT CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN REDUCING CLIMATE POLLUTION. THE SCOPING PLAN WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS AND INVESTMENT TO BE UNDERTAKEN OVER THE COMING DECADE TO REACH OUR HELP PROTECT THE CLIMATE STANDARDS THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT AT THE PLANT DEVELOP KARBI UTILIZED BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EXPERTISE TO EVALUATE QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT AND BENEFIT. OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND ASSOCIATED STRATEGIES TO FOLLOW THE BILL ALSO CALLS FOR CARD TO DETERMINE WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED TO ADVANCE THIS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH ANALYSIS. IF THOSE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE I THINK THAT A CAR MOVES. TO DEVELOP THE TWENTY TWO AND FUTURE ITERATIONS OF THE SCOPING PLAN. THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH EVALUATION. WILL REALLY ALLOW FOR DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAYS THAT THE POLICIES THAT CALIFORNIA PURSUES MIGHT INTERACT WITH HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY. EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY. THE PROCESS CAN HELP THE REALLY TO IDENTIFY WHICH POLICIES MIGHT NEED TO BREAK BE PRIORITIZED GOING FORWARD. AND YET YOU EXTREMELY IMPORTANTLY TO HELP THE AGENCY BETTER HOME HEALTH PROTECTIVE MITIGATION.

ELECTRICITY NEEDS FROM TWENTY NINETEEN JUMPED FROM OFFSHORE WINDS. AND WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A WORLD LEADER IN TACKLING MANY ASPECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE JUMPED AHEAD OF US IN TAPPING INTO OFFSHORE WIND. UP FOR EXAMPLE MY NEED TO COUNTRY SCOTLAND WITH 97% COVERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY LAST YEAR AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST CORTES WAS FROM OFFSHORE WIND. BUT MATTER IF THEY'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP OFFSHORE WIND TECHNOLOGY HAS IMPROVED SO THAT WE CAN MEDICALLY BLOATING BY.

I'M NEXT- AB TEN EIGHTY SEVEN IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU VENTURE OUT FIRST I'LL BE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO LIMIT THE FUNDING SOURCE- THAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO JUST THE RESIDENTIAL CLIMATE CREDIT TO AVOID IMPACTING THE INDUSTRIALISTS DISTANCE AND SMALL BUSINESS CREDITS. AS WELL AS AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE THIRD PARTY GRANT ADMINISTRATOR AND OTHER CLARIFYING CHANGES. THIS BILL IS ACUTELY NEEDED TO ADDRESS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES DURING CLIMATE CRISIS. DURING RECENT WILDFIRES HEAT WAVES AND POWER SHUT OFFS MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY CHALLENGE WITHOUT SAFE SPACES TO PROTECT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. FROM EXTREME CONDITIONS. RESILIENCE HOPES AREN'T INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY LED SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THIS BILL WOULD AIM TO BOLSTER COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST LIKE LIBRARIES SCHOOLS COMMUNITY CENTERS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP. THROUGH CLEAN ENERGY AND PUBLIC HEALTH UPGRADES TO OFFER COMMUNITIES SAFE SPACES TO GATHER ACCESS CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE BACKUP POWER REFRIGERATION AND CLEAN AIR AND OTHERWISE BE PROTECTED FROM CLIMATE CRISIS. THIS MODEL GOES BEYOND DISASTER RESPONSE BY CREATING HUBS WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS EVERYDAY SERVICES AND A CLIMATE AND IT AND A CHANGING CLIMATE. THE CURRENT PATCHWORK OF PROGRAMS HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENT WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE OBSTACLES ACCESSING BENEFITS ACROSS THESE OPPORTUNITIES. BY REDIRECTING A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE CLIMATE CREDIT THIS BILL MAKES POSSIBLE COMMUNITY SKILLED BENEFITS FROM PROJECTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES.

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HUBS ROGRAM WILL ADVANCE PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. WHILE ALSO ENHANCING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE EVENTS AND OTHER DISASTERS. THE BUILDINGS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE COMMUNITY CENTERS HEALTH CLINICS SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND OTHER PUBLIC GATHERING SPACES AND THE IMPROVEMENTS MAY INCLUDE THINGS LIKE COOLING AND AIR FILTRATION ENERGY EFFICIENCY SOLAR BACKUP POWER. AND ELECTRICAL UPGRADES. MANY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CURRENTLY DIFFICULT ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE ARE COMPLEX OFTEN SILOS YOU HAVE TO APPLY TO MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE UPGRADE OR REQUIRE COMPETING WITH BETTER RESEARCH APPLICANTS. THERE ALSO NO EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON COMPREHENSIVE UPGRADES TO CRITICAL COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS. THIS PROGRAM WILL BE A ONE STOP SHOP THAT INCLUDES DIRECT TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND FUNDING FOR SUITE UPGRADES FOR COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS THAT SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THIS PROJECT PROJECT MUST ALSO DEMONSTRATE COMEDIAN GAUGE MEN AND REFLECT GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF THE STATE THESE ONLY PROJECT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO CREATE FAMILY SUPPORTING JOBS AND SPUR VALUABLE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO KEEP CALIFORNIA AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND HIGH QUALITY WORK IN BUILDINGS.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME HER THINK WE WERE AT THE FIVE MINUTE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MEMBERS I'M WE'RE AT FIVE MINUTES- OF ACCEPTING WITNESSES- IN WHICH- WE ARE LIMITING IT TO BUT IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE THAT WANTS TO SUBMIT. OF THEIR POSITION ON THIS BILL- YOU CAN DO IT VIA OUR WEBSITE THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE THANK YOU. I'M AT. DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM I DON'T SEE ANY WITNESSES IN THE REMOTE LOCATION. THERE ARE NONE- ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I REQUEST MR SARATH SO DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MUCH THE SHIFT IS FROM CONSUMERS INTO THIS PROGRAM. ABSOLUTELY SO- FIRST OF ALL I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THIS BILL WE PROPOSED AN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT- USE OF THE CLIMATE CREDIT IN THE LAST COMMITTEE THAT OT TAKEN DOWN FROM 85% DOWN TO FIVE PERCENT. BOB SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE COST OF THE CLIMATE CREDIT- THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT ON LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS BECAUSE WE EXEMPT OUT- FOLKS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CARE PROGRAM AND IN THE FAIR PROGRAM. AND THEN WITHIN MINUTES WERE TAKEN IN THIS COMMITTEE WE'RE ACTUALLY ALSO EXEMPTING OUT INDUSTRIAL ASSISTANCE AND SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT SO. THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT AND NO NON RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS NO IMPACT ON GIGI R. F. OR ANY THE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORTED THERE SO THE CUSTOMERS WHO WILL BE IMPACTED WILL ONLY SEE A REDUCTION OF ABOUT FIFTY CENTS PER MONTH. SO THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE TOTAL MARKET SURE I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S IN THE FORTY MILLION RANGE I'M JUST I WANT TO ASK- MERION FROM ENERGY SEE IF YOU HAVE THE NUMBER. THE FINAL NUMBER. YEAH IT'S- IT'S FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS. THE FIFTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS AND HOW MUCH IS THIS PROGRAM. GOING TO I MEAN IF THE PROGRAM WERE DONE BECAUSE BEFORE YOU SAID THESE ARE ENERGY I MEAN IT WAS BROUGHT DOWN TO FIVE PERCENT. AND SO OBVIOUSLY AT 80% THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE FUNDING MUCH MORE IS THAT HOW MUCH. A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WOULD BE. WELL IT LET ME LET ME JUST SAY WHAT I THINK THERE IS CONSENSUS ON FROM EVERYONE INVOLVED THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH IS THE NEED IS SOMETHING WE ALL SHARE WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE. COMMUNITY HUBS RESILIENCY HUBS THAT NEED TO BE HARDENED AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE CRISIS- IT OPEN UP TO ME. OBVIOUSLY WENT FROM EIGHTY FIVE DOWN 25% SO I WOULD'VE BEEN FINE FOR US TO. HAVE EXPENDITURES SEVENTEEN TIMES OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT BUT AT LEAST BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING IN THE SPACE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND WE THINK- AND CERTAINLY THE LAST COMMITTEE- UNC. THOUGHT THAT IT MADE SENSE FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD OF THIS SO THAT WE PILOTED. A FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS CD IMPACT- BECAUSE WE NOTICE ARE AVAILABLE COMMUNITIES IT'S OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. IT'S A LOT OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES- THAT ARE IN DIRE NEED OF THIS I KNOW FOR YOURSELF AS A FORMER FIREFIGHTER YOU KNOW THAT ACUTELY. RIGHT AND I DO KNOW THAT ACUTELY AND THAT'S WHY FOR ME IT'S MORE OF AN ISSUE OF. THE PROGRAM IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. BUT WERE JUST MINIMALLY FUNDING IT AND WE'RE DOING THAT ON YOU KNOW BY TRANSFERRING MONEY FROM CONSUMERS ENDED THIS INSTEAD OF USING SOME OF THE MONEY THEY'VE ALREADY PAID IN TAXES. AND CREATED THIS LARGE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE- BUDGET SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE. WE SHOULD JUST PARTNER PRO USING THAT SO SOME OF THAT SURPLUS TO DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SOURCE OF THIS LITTLE DROP IN THE BUCKET MONEY IS NOT GOING TO. MAKE A HUGE IMPACT ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE IN THE NEAR TERM WHICH IS WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO THAT'S MY ISSUE WITH IT SO THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW YOU KNOW LISTEN. TO A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT TRIVIAL. AND THERE HASN'T BEEN CONSISTENT IN THE PAST ON EXACTLY HOW WHAT MONIES WE USE AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST. A PROPOSAL TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IN A TIMELY WAY- BUT AGAIN RESPECTFULLY I. APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON THIS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MR TWO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW AS I STATED BEFORE- THIS IS A MODEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO HELP UPGRADE CRITICAL FACILITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE RESILIENCY OF OUR COMMUNITY STERN CLIMATE CRISIS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT.

ARE CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IMPLEMENTS A CLEAN TRUCK BUS AND OFF ROAD VEHICLE PROGRAM. US OTHERS WERE GETTING THESE CLEAN TRUCKS OUT THERE BUT IT DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF THOSE TRUCKS. VIA A PEER TO PEER TRUCK SHARING PLATFORM. THAT MEANS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CLEAN TRUCKS SOME OF THEM ARE SITTING IDLE WHEN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE USED. IF THEY WERE SHARED- THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR A DEMONSTRATION WHERE USERS CAN PLACE YOUR VEHICLE ON A TRUCK SHARING PLATFORM. WHICH WILL PERMIT THE VEHICLE BE USED INSTEAD OF SITTING IDLE. IT WILL HELP CALIFORNIA IN OUR QUEST TO REACH. OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. BY USING A CREATIVE IDEA LET'S SMALLER AND INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES AND INDEPENDENT OVER TRUCK DRIVERS- USER TRUCKS MORE. AND HAVE ACCESS TO A BROAD ARRAY OF CLEAN TRUCKS TO CARRY OUR GOALS FORWARD.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES WILDFIRES HAVE INCREASED IN INTENSITY AND DESTRUCTIVENESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. USING FOR AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY BETWEEN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO MORE THAN ONE MILLION ACRES ANNUALLY THIS DECADE. THE CONDITION OF CALIFORNIA'S FORCE HAVE LED TO HIGHER INTENSITY WILDFIRES THAT ARE FAR MORE DESTRUCTIVE. THAN WHEN THE FORESTS AND WILDLANDS WE'RE IN A MORE ECOLOGICALLY BENEFICIAL RESILIENT INDIVIDUAL. WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ALSO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND POLLUTION. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A BROAD REPRESENTATION OF LOCAL STATE FEDERAL AGENCIES FINALIZE CALIFORNIA'S FORCE CARBON PLAN TO SET GOALS TO IMPROVE FOREST HEALTH. EVENT AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRES AND PROMOTE CARBON SIX QUEST CREATION ENFORCE AND WILDLANDS. THE PLAN IS THE RESULT OF SEVERAL YEARS OF CAREFUL COLLABORATION INCLUDES VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND FUELS TREATMENT STRATEGIES. FOR CARBON PLAN SCHOOLS ALSO SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S MOST RECENT FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE ACTION PLAN. WELL OFTEN CITED AS A ROAD MAP FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM CALIFORNIA'S DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THE CALIFORNIA FOREST CARBON PLAN GOALS HAVE NO STATUTORY AUTHORITY BEHIND THEM. TO DEMONSTRATE THE STATE'S COMMITMENTS TO IMPROVING FOREST HEALTH. REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIE AND INCREASING CARBON SEQUESTRATION. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE DOES THE FOLLOWING. CODIFIES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY GOALS OF CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIA FOREST CARBON PLAN AND STRESSES THE URGENCY OF IMPROVING FOREST HEALTH. AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WILDFIRES. IT REQUIRES THE STATE TO IDENTIFY THE FOUR RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. AND FINALLY PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE GREATER OVERSIGHT BY REQUIRING. CAL THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND CAL EPA TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE PROGRESS OF MEETING THESE GOALS. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES FIND WORK TO APPROVE THIS BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD.

RT RT MEMBER COUNTIES CONTAINMENT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA'S FORESTED LANDS INCLUDING MORE THAN 70% OF THE STATE'S NATIONAL FOREST LANDS ARE COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY MORE THE MAJORITY OF DESTRUCTION CAUSED BY HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRES BUT THOSE RESEARCHERS SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE YOU'LL LOADS AND THE IMPACT OF A RENEWED DROUGHT. WILDFIRES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY HORRIFIC BOTH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF LIVES INSTRUCTORS LOST BURNED INCLUDING ROUGHLY 4% OF THE STATE LAST YEAR ALONE. WELL WILDFIRE HAS ALWAYS HAD A PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIA ECOSYSTEM MODERN FIRES ARE FAR MORE DESTRUCTIVE IN ADDITION TO THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GG EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM WILDFIRES AND POST FIRE TO K. WHILE PARLAYED AIR POLLUTION IS BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER PROBLEM EVEN IN DISTANT URBAN AREAS. JUST IS AB THIRTY TWO SB THIRTY TWO CODIFIED STATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS AB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE SEEKS TO CODIFY THE FORCED IMPROVEMENT GOALS SET FORTH BY THE FORCE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM. ARE HERE HE WAS A PROUD PARTICIPANT AND THE FORCE CLIMATE ACTION TEAM AND BELIEVES THE GOALS TARGETS AND STRATEGIES THEY SET FORTH ARE VITAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE RESILIENCE OF CALIFORNIA'S FORESTS AND WILDLANDS AB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE ALSO HELPS IMPROVE THE STATE'S LONG TERM PLANNING BY REQUIRING STATE AGENCIES TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHAT RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS.

AB NINE SIX TWO WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR REFILLABLE BEVERAGE BOTTLES. BOTTLE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA BY ALLOWING BOTTLES TO FLOW THROUGH. THE CAL RECYCLE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. RATHER THAN BEING CRASHED FOR RECYCLING THE BOTTLES CAN BE PRESERVED TO BE WASHED AND RE FILLED BY BEVERAGE PRODUCERS SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING JOBS AND REDUCING WASTE. THE DATA SHOWS CALIFORNIANS PRODUCED AN AVERAGE OF TWO TO THREE PACKAGE TO PURCHASE. AN AVERAGE OF TWO TO THREE PACKAGE DRINKS EVERY DAY NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF WHICH ARE SINGLE USE GLASS PLASTIC METAL. OR PAPERBOARD BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THE LARGEST CATEGORY OF THESE ARE BEVERAGES COVERED BY THE CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION SINGLE USE CONTAINERS ANNUALLY. THOSE 7280% OF THESE CONTAINERS ARE RETURNED AND SUCCESSFULLY RECYCLED INTO MOSTLY NEW CONTAINERS NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OF SINGLE USE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE STILL DISPOSED OF ANNUALLY THIS IS A WEIGHTY PROBLEM THAT ISN'T GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. THERE ARE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THEIR PART BY USING REFILLABLE BOTTLES. THESE BOTTLES ARE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE CHOICE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN USING MORE GLASS REFILLABLE BOTTLES. THEY KEEP OUR AIR CLEAN OUR BEACHES PARKS AND ROADSIDES LITTER LITTER FREE PROMOTE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND INCENTIVIZE A RENEWAL OF RETURNABLE GLASS SOMETHING THAT WAS COMMON FORTY YEARS AGO. LAST YEAR I VISITED ORGANS REFILLABLE BOTTLES SYSTEM DROP WHERE IF THE LEVELS ARE STARTED WATCHED STERILIZED INSPECTED AND DELIVERED BACK TO CRAFT BEVERAGE PRODUCERS. CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES THAT HAVE STARTED USING GLASS REFILLABLE BOTTLES ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF STATE TO HAVE THEM WASHED STERILIZED AND INSPECTED. AB NINE SIX TWO WILL LOSE WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL BY CREATING AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR THE USE OF REFILLABLE BEVERAGE BOTTLES BY BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS. IT'S A STATUTORY FIX WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE MARK MURRAY AND RICH NORGROVE CEO AND FOUNDING BREWMASTER. FOR BEAR REPUBLIC BREWING AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BILL. THANK YOU- MODERATOR KEEP PLEASE OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES. CUEBALL FINES ARE OPEN. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- BEFORE PLASTIC BEFORE ALUMINUM REFILLABLE GLASS BOTTLES WERE THE ORIGINAL BEVERAGE CONTAINER. AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION REFILLABLE GLASS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS WERE REGULARLY DISTRIBUTED IN RETURN FOR REFILLING CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THE REFILL GLASS BOTTLES WHEN REGULARLY RETURNS WASHED AND REBUILD HAVE A LOWER COST FOR BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS. EIGHTY NINE SIX TO UPDATE STATUTES TO ALLOW REFILLABLE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS WHICH THE CONSUMER IS ALREADY PAID THE R. B. TWO B. PER TURN FOR REFUND OF THAT C. R. D. WASHED REFILLED AND RE DISTRIBUTED. IN STATE. THEY'RE ALREADY GLASS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS CAPABLE OF RETURN WASH AND REFILL BEING SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. THIS MEASURE IS NEEDED TO ALLOW THOSE CONTAINERS TO BE RETURNED AND WASHED- AND REBUILD TO CURRENT INTERSTATE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WHICH BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS. AND CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY PAYING. WE URGE NIVEAU AND ON AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY. THANKS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

REPUBLICAN TENDS TO BEGIN TO PACKAGE YOUR- INTO A SINGLE RETURNABLE GLASS BOTTLE THIS YEAR. THIS RETURNABLE BOTTLE HAS A 95% LOWER CARBON FOOTPRINT THAN A SINGLE USE GLASS BOTTLE YOU CAN BE WASHED AND FILLED OVER TWENTY FIVE TIMES. RETURNABLE BOTTLE SYSTEMS EXIST ALL AROUND THE WORLD AND WHY NOT HERE. AFTER THE INITIAL GLASS BOTTLE PURCHASED THE COST PER. MILLION RECORDED BOTTLE IS REDUCED OVER THE LIFECYCLE OF THE BOTTLE ALLOWING BEER MANUFACTURES TO BENEFIT. FROM INCREASED COST SAVINGS AS THE BOTTLES ARE REACHED RETURNED FOR REFILLING. WIENER CALIFORNIA BOTTLE BILL TO SUPPORT THE OPTIONS YOU HAVE THIS COST SAVING AND SUSTAINABLE RETURNABLE BEVERAGE BOTTLE BLOWING THROUGH OUR REDEMPTION THE STUDENTS.

AS WE ALL KNOW LAST WEEK. PRESIDENT BIDEN CONVENED LEADERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SUMMIT. TO ADDRESS THIS GRAVE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS FACING OUR GENERATION AND OUR WORLD. PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE A BOLD CALL TO ALL AMERICANS TO CUT OUR NATION'S EMISSIONS AND HALF IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. IN ORDER TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR IF WE DON'T REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE WILL MISS THE POINT OF NO RETURN. WHERE ARE PLANET. OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE STILL ALIVE. WILL SUFFER MASSIVELY. AND MANY MANY WILL DIE. ALREADY TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING FROM THE RAPIDLY UNFOLDING EFFECTS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. EVERY YEAR MORE AND MORE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. LIVES LOST. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC DAMAGES. SMOKE FILLED ORANGE SKIES. RAINING ASH. THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE BREATHING IN. MEGA DROUGHTS. EXTREME HEAT. WHAT WE NEEDED TO. AS THE LEGISLATURE AS LAWMAKERS FOR THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. TO AVERT THIS CATASTROPHIC FATE. THIS BILL PROPOSES FOR MAIN ACTIONS. FIRST THIS BILL WILL CODIFY OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY OR BEFORE TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WITH A NET NEGATIVE EMISSIONS THEREAFTER. A COMMITMENT MADE THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. IT IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN EXECUTIVE ORDER. SECOND THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO CREATE A ROADMAP TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. WITH AT LEAST 90% OF REQUIRED EMISSION REDUCTIONS. TO BE ACHIEVED THROUGH DIRECT EMISSION REDUCTIONS. TO INSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY MAKE NECESSARY REDUCTIONS. BUT THAT WE ALSO pIMPACTS ESPECIALLY IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIRD THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATIVE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE SOLUTIONS. AND WILL REQUIRE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO ESTABLISH REGULATIONS FOR THEIR USE. FINALLY THIS BILL WILL PRIORITIZE THE IMPORTANT USE OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. TO CAPTURE CARBON IN OUR FORESTS SOILS AND OCEANS. I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT ALL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. I WAS GOING TO TURN OVER TO MY JOIN AUTHOR THE CELL NUMBER GARCIA BUT I. DON'T SEE HER AVAILABLE AND SO AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO. TURN IT OVER TO THE TWO WITNESSES ALEX JACKSON JACKSON.

GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS ALEX JACKSON ON BEHALF OF ENERGY C. PLEASED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THE PROVIDED TO THE LEVEL OF AMBITION REQUIRED TO CONFRONT THE ESCALATING QUITE A CRISIS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. I MEAN YOU JUST OUTLINED VIRTUALLY EVERY ASPECT OF OUR STATE TO AVOID EVEN MORE CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS WE MUST ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS TO SLOW STOP AND REVERSE THE BUILDUP OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. WE CAN DO THAT WE NEED COMMITMENT CLARITY IN COLLABORATION EACH. OF WHICH ANIMATES THE SPELL. PERSONAL CONDUCT CAL COMMIT. TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY AS SOON AS- NO LATER THAN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE AIRPORT IS DEVELOPING THE TWENTY TWENTY TO UPDATE TO THIS COMPANY PLAN. AND WILL NEED DIRECTION AND BUY IN FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS AFFECTING A DURABLE FRAMEWORK THANKS FOR NEEDED INVESTMENTS. SECOND FIVE W.

AND I THINK BOTH BOXERS OR BRIEFS MEASURE FOR OUR SITE ASK OKAY. NECK WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE CONSTRUCTION HAPPENING CONSIDER ALLEN ST CHAIR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PROPERTIES TODAY THAT WE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING IN DEALING WITH THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ASSOCIATED EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS FROM HEAT EXTREME HEAT THE FLOODS THE FIRE AND DROUGHT IPCC SCIENTIST THEY TO AVOID SOME OF THE WORST AND MOST DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE TO ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS IN REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY MID CENTURY IF NOT SOONER. AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE WOULD PUT IT ON A PATH TO HELP ACHIEVE SUCH A GOAL BY ACCELERATING EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DIRECTLY IN BY ELEVATING OTHER CRITICAL CLIMATE STRATEGIES LIKE NATURE BASED CLIMATE POLLUTION AND CARBON APPROVALS FOR TECHNOLOGIES SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND OTHER COLLEAGUES SUGGEST THAT WITHOUT INTERVENTION OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING AN INCREASING THAT SOURCE EMISSIONS INSTEAD OF INCREASING THAT SINK TO THE FIRE IN MY AND CONVERSION AMONG OTHER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. THE GOOD NEWS THEN WITH IMMEDIATE ACTION AND INTERVENTION WE CAN CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY REDUCING EMISSIONS ENHANCING CARBON SEQUESTRATION THROUGH A VARIETY OF MANAGEMENT RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES ARE NATURAL LOOKING LAND CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR TEAM OF CARBON NEUTRALITY HOWEVER FOR THESE RESOURCES COMPLAINING POLL WELL TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS THEY NEED TO BE A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY WITH POLICY THAT INVESTMENTS ARE ON PAR WITH OTHER SECTORS. THIS IS WHY WE ARE SO PLEASED THAT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE PRIORITIZES NATURE BASED CLIMATE STRATEGIES AS PART OF THE STATE'S OVERALL GOAL TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY WE RESPECTFULLY- URGE YOUR AYE. VOTE ON IT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE TO WAIT. IN OPPOSITE. TIM JEFFRIES FROM THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF BOILERMAKERS WHICH I BELIEVE IS. IN THE HEARING ROOM.

AND KILL OFF THE RAPID GROWTH OF IN MANUFACTURING THAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW CARVING CHARACTERS NOT SOME FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY. IS NOT DESIGNED TO MERELY CREATE A PATH OF PERMITTED DIVERT DEPENDENCY ON FOSSIL FUELS THE BOILERMAKERS TO THE NORTH HAVE BUILT AND OPERATED A UTILITY SCALE CARBON CAPTURE PLANT.

WE ALSO WORK WITH MANY PROJECTS ARE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE BILL YOU BAY AREA. LA IN KERN COUNTY ON UTILITY SCALE CARBON CAPTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL UTILIZE CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY. TO TAKE CARBON OUT OF THE AIR AND CREATE GOOD JOBS FOR BLUE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS. PEOPLE THAT WANT TO UC CARBON CAPTURE INNOVATION KILLED IN CALIFORNIA ARE FOCUSED SOLELY. ON KILLING A FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. BUT WHAT THEY AREN'T FOCUSED ON ALL THE EFFECTS THAT THIS MISGUIDED POLICY WILL HAVE ON INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY AMEND AFFECTED DESIGNED TO MEET. THE CLIMATE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA'S LEADER MANUFACTORY ELECTRIC CARS AND BUSES TO MEET THE DEMANDS. AND MANDATES WITHOUT CARBON CAPTURE. WE CAN ALSO BID FAREWELL TO THIS TYPE OF MANUFACTURING REALLY EVERY TYPE MANUFACTURING. AS WE LEAVE THE STATE AND IT WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE THE STATE FOR OTHER STATES WERE MANUFACTURING IS OFFSET MY CARBON CAPTURE. AT THE PASSAGE OF NAFTA CALIFORNIA LOST MORE JOBS THAN ANY OTHER STATE.

THAT WAS PRESENT AND CALLED IN OF TO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. SEE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER SEA ARE TO. THANK YOU SO. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO- YOU KNOW HELP OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CREATE CLEAN AIR BECAUSE WE ALL NEED THAT- BUT YES I REALLY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THIS AND THE BIG ONE IS BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT AND THAT'S THE TEN PERCENT. OF A C. C. S. N. AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATING FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH WE JUST SAID WE WANT TO LEAD THE WORLD. IN AND IT YOU KNOW CREATING AND THAT THE CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY POLL ARE THEY ENVIRONMENTAL PUSH- TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS- IF. IN AN EARLY RETIREMENT WIND ENERGY AND LOSING OUR- LOSING TO THE EAST COAST. LOSING THAT TECHNOLOGY OVER THERE- IF WE'RE GOING TO LEAD IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE REST OF THE WORLD. NEEDS THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND SO. IF THEY'RE DEPENDING ON US TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY BUT WORSHIPING THAT WE'RE DISINCENTIVE ICING THE TECHNOLOGY. HOW ARE E GOING TO. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THE REST OF THE WORLD ON BOARD WITH THE TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED. TO TRY TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS BECAUSE WE CAN DO AS MUCH WE CAN ALL GET TO ZERO RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT DOING IT EITHER. ARE NOT NOT ABLE TO DO IT- WORKS WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WE ALL BREATHE THE SAME AIR. SO WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER TO THOSE CONCERNS THAT YOU HEARD OUT THERE BECAUSE THIS CREATES JOBS. AND YOU KNOW THE MANUFACTURING LORD KNOWS WE NEED IT HERE. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT RAISING PEOPLE OUT OF POVERTY THEY NEED JOBS TO DO THAT. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT 10% THANK YOU MISTER SURCHARGE SO I. COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE EVERYONE- THAT SPOKE OF- BOTH FOR AND AGAINST- THIS BILL- AND- NO EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF. THE INNOVATION IN THE CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE SPACE- THIS BILL. BUT DOES NOT. CREATE ANY CAPS FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS CEATED THIS FALSE NARRATIVE OF. YOU KNOW OUR ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND FRAMEWORK TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO PLACE YOU KNOW THE OVERWHELMING EMPHASIS ON THE NEED FOR GROSS EMISSION REDUCTIONS YOU KNOW TO FOCUS ON THIS FALSE NARRATIVE QUITE FRANKLY THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO. CAP CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN FACT. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FOR THE INNOVATION I MEAN IF- IF CALIFORNIA CAN DEVELOP THE BIG CARBON VACUUM THAT CAN SUCK UP ALL THE CARBON IN OUR ATMOSPHERE THEN MORE POWER TO THEM THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT LIMITS THE CARBON CAPTURE STORAGE CONTRIBUTION TO THE- GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THROUGH CARBON CAPTURE AND IN FACT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR- WE HAVE ACCEPTED ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS EVERY ACCEPTED FROM THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEES- THANK THE CHAIRS SIX. RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT WAS TO TAKE OUT THAT 10% LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S CLEARLY- BEEN MISTER INTERPRETED AND USED. TO CREATE THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THEY WERE TRYING TO CAPTURE THE CARBON CAPTURE SO WE ARE TAKING OUT THAT 10% CAP- THAT THAT 10% LANGUAGE. BUT THAT THE MAIN POINT IS THIS THAT IN ORDER TO REACH CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE NEED TO. DRAMATICALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT IS WHAT- A RECENT AARP STUDY ON ON HOW TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BUT TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AS THEY THEY EXPLORED THREE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS BETWEEN YOU KNOW 90% OVER 90% REDUCTIONS 2280% REDUCTIONS BUT IN ANY CASE. YOU KNOW EVERY. CREDIBLE FEASIBLE STUDY THAT IS FOCUSED ON HOW WE GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHETHER THE COMMISSION THAT THE STUDY RECENTLY COMMISSIONED BY THE A RP OR WHETHER STUDIES COMMISSIONED AND EUROPE. HAVE ALL FOCUSED ON. MODELS WHERE WE CAN ONLY ACHIEVE THAT GOAL IF WE FOCUS ON THE NEED FOR GROSS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THE MAIN POINT OF THIS IS THAT WE CANNOT ALLOW CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE. AS AN EXCUSE. IN ORDER TO KEEP BURNING FOSSIL FUELS WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE. THAT THAT DRAMATIC TRANSITION THAT IS THE ONLY WAY- QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE CAN SAVE OUR PLANET. OKAY WELL THAT'S DRAMATIC- AND- BUT I GUESS I HAVE TO SAY IT YOU CAN REMOVE THE 10% LANGUAGE BUT IF YOU LEAVE THE 90% LANGUAGE ALL THAT LEAVES IS 10% AND THAT REMOVES THE INCENTIVE FOR TECHNOLOGY TO DO THEIR THING. TO ENABLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT CAR THAT CCS. TECHNOLOGY TO ADVANCE AND ACTUALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE BY HAVING. YOU KNOW HAVING A MARKET OUT THERE WHERE IT'S NEEDED. OR WHERE IT'S EFFECTIVE DAN IT'S NOT GOING TO EXIST. SO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I JUST DIFFER A LITTLE BIT ON IT THE GRAVITY OKAY- BUT BUT ON THIS I A DIFFERENT ITEMS. I DEFEND MY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON. IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY THE INCENTIVE YOU TAKE AWAY TO THE JOB OKAY OKAY SO I'M THAT. THANK YOU OF IT I MAY BE MISTAKE. AGAIN I YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT AND- AND THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT.

WHICH IS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEARLY TWENTY PROJECTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. MANY OF WHICH INCLUDED A HOUSING COMPONENT. WHILE PROVIDING WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE IN CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET PROJECT ENTITLED.

ELEMENTA CONSTRUCTION IS WE KNOW IT HAS BEEN DECIMATED AND HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NOT THAT WE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT THE HOUSING CRISIS HAS GOTTEN MUCH MUCH WORSE THAN THE PROJECT IN THE QUEUE IN FUTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED.
