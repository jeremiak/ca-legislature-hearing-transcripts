IMPACTS I WANT TO START OFF A

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.870
LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT- BUT OUR

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.638
OFFICES ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:10.908
PROCESS- WE HAVE- AS A

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:12.844
STATUTORY ROOMS PROCESS THAT WE

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.079
PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE. IMPARTIAL

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:17.014
DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:19.283
MEASURE AND IT'S FISCAL IMPACTS

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.285
FOR THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.453
AND UNDER THIS SOMEWHAT NARROW

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.255
ROLE WE DON'T THINK OF THIS ON

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.424
THE MERITS OF MEASURES AND FOR

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:27.525
THAT REASON I WILL BE ABLE TO

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:28.926
SPEAK THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES IN

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:29.994
THE HEARING TODAY BUT YOU DO

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.362
HAVE A NUMBER OF PANELISTS WILL

FOLLOW. AFTER ME WHO ARE BETTER

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:34.799
POSITIONED TO SPEAK TO THOSE

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:37.134
ISSUES BEFORE GETTING INTO THE

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.436
MEASURE I WANTED TO JUST

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.637
BRIEFLY GIVE A BIT OF A

00:35:39.704 --> 00:35:41.339
BACKGROUND ON CALIFORNIA'S

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:44.375
EXISTING PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM.

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:44.909
PROPERTY TAXES ARE THE SO

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.210
LARGEST GOVERNMENT REVENUE

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:49.247
SOURCE IN AND IT IS EXCLUSIVELY

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:50.214
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:52.650
SOURCE PROVIDING ABOUT SIXTY

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:53.618
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:55.887
CITIES. COUNTY SCHOOLS AND

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:57.955
SPECIAL DISTRICTS. THERE'S

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.090
SEVERAL CLASSES A PROPERTY THAT

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:01.425
ARE TAXED ON THE PROPERTY TAX

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:02.727
TO A MAIN CATEGORIES ARE REAL

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:04.529
PROPERTY WHICH OUR LAND AND

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.597
BUILDINGS. ANOTHER MAJOR

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:08.065
CATEGORY. BUSINESS PERSONAL

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.267
PROPERTY WHICH IS ALL THE OTHER

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:10.902
THINGS THAT BUSINESSES ON LIKE

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.637
EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY AND

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:15.306
COMPUTERS AND FURNITURE- THESE

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.407
TWO CATEGORIES OF PROPERTY OR

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.742
TAX-DIFFERENTLY UNDER OUR

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:20.711
CURRENT SYSTEM- REAL PROPERTY

00:36:20.778 --> 00:36:22.480
IS TAXED BASED ON THE SYSTEM

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.148
THAT WAS CREATED BY PROPOSITION

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:25.216
THIRTEEN THAT IS ITS- ITS

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.751
TAXABLE VALUE OR ASSESSED VALUE

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:29.520
IS SET BASED ON ITS- PURCHASE

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.755
PRICE WHEN IT'S PURCHASED. AT

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.123
THE ASSESSOR SENTENCED ACTUAL

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:34.859
VALUE BASED ON WHAT IT WAS BUT

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.594
I WHAT WAS PAID FOR AND- EACH

00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:37.595
YEAR THEREAFTER THAT TACKLE

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.330
VALUES ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:41.399
BY UP TO TWO PERCENT. THE NAME

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:43.067
OF THE PROPERTY IS SOLD AGAIN

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.502
IT'S TAX WITHOUT USE RESET TO

00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:46.137
ITS NEW PURCHASE PRICE. UNDER

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:48.639
THIS SYSTEM- MOST PROPERTIES

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.942
ARE TAX- IT'S SOMETHING BELOW

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.343
THEIR MARKET VALUE OR WHAT THEY

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.411
COULD BE PAID FOR THIS IS

00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:55.846
BECAUSE- THE MARKET VALUE MOST

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:59.483
PROPERTIES GROWS. MORE THAN 2%

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.418
A YEAR. BUSINESS PERSONAL.

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.687
INCOME IS TACK BASED ON ITS

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:08.526
pSOLD FOR TODAY- SO TURNING TO

00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:09.727
HOW THE INITIATIVE WOULD CHANGE

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.462
THIS PROJECT SYSTEM IT WOULD

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.297
MAKE CHANGES BOTH TO. A REAL

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.299
PROPERTY ASSESSMENT AND TO

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:15.833
BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.735
ASSESSMENT. OUR FIRST THE

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.171
MEASURE WOULD- SHIFT COMMERCIAL

00:37:20.237 --> 00:37:21.706
AND INDUSTRIAL REAL PROPERTY TO

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:24.475
MARKET VALUE TAXATION. OF THIS

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:25.876
CHANGE WOULD BE PHASED IN OVER

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:28.145
A NUMBER OF YEARS BEGINNING IN

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.580
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THE

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.049
CHANGE WOULD NOT START UNTIL

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:33.184
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOUR-

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.318
PROPERTIES THAT ARE USED

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:37.088
PRIMARILY BY BUSINESSES WITH.

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:38.489
FIFTY OR FEWER EMPLOYEES AND

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:40.091
THAT MEET CERTAIN OTHER

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:42.526
CRITERIA PROPERTIES USED FOR

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.829
HOUSING AND AGRICULTURAL LAND-

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.697
WOULD REMAIN OF THE PROP

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.265
THIRTEEN SYSTEM WOULD BE TAX

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.000
BASED ON THEIR ORIGINAL

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.968
PURCHASE PRICE. US SOME

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:51.769
COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:53.204
PROPERTIES ALSO WOULD BE

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.271
EXEMPTED FROM THE SHIP THE

00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:56.407
MARKET VALUE TAXATION UNDER THE

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:57.642
MEASURE SPECIFICALLY. OF THOSE

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.510
PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED BY A

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:02.113
PERSON OR BUSINESS THAT OWNS-

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:04.982
IN TOTAL- THREE MILLION OR LESS

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:06.751
IN PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA-

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:08.319
WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THE

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:10.454
SHIFT TO MARKET VALUE TAXATION.

00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:11.956
THE MEASURE ALSO PROPOSES

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.324
CHANGES THE BUSINESS PERSONAL

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.625
PROPERTY THAT WOULD REDUCE

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:17.061
ACTUAL VALUE OF HIS PERSONAL

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:20.231
PROPERTY BY FIVE HUNDRED

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:20.998
THOUSAND FOR EACH BUSINESS. IF

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.701
A BUSINESS HAS LESS THAN FIVE

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:24.268
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:24.902
BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY THAN

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.704
THEY WOULD PAY NO TAX ON THOSE

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:29.106
ITEMS. IN ADDITION ALL PERSONAL

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:32.943
TAXES WOULD BE ELIMINATED FOR-

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.978
BUSINESSES WITH MORE THAN FIFTY

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:35.913
EMPLOYEES AND THAT MEANS. A

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.651
CERTAIN OTHER CRITERIA THEN

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:43.187
TURNING OUR- OF THE FOR OF THE

00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:45.389
MEASURE THE LAW. THE FACT IS

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.258
FROM THE SHIFT OF COMMERCIAL

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:48.659
AND INDUSTRIAL REAL PROPERTY TO

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.095
MARKET VALUE TAXATION. MOST

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.697
OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL REAL

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.565
PROPERTY WOULD. FACE HIGHER

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.267
PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.335
SHIFT THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF

00:38:58.402 --> 00:38:59.403
THOSE PROPERTIES TAX OF VALUES

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.706
NOW FALL BELOW THEIR MARKET

00:39:01.772 --> 00:39:03.741
VALUE. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.443
THESE HIGHER TAXES WE PHASED IN

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.411
OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. WE

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:10.214
THINK THOUGH BY AROUND TWENTY

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.382
TWENTY FIVE MOST- COMMERCIAL

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:12.783
PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BE PAYING

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.453
A HIGHER TAXES. OF BEGINNING

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:17.755
AROUND THIS TIME- TOTAL NEW

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:18.989
REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:21.592
SHIFT. WOULD BE SOMEWHERE

00:39:21.659 --> 00:39:23.394
BETWEEN EIGHT BILLION AND

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:24.762
TWELVE I'VE FOUGHT DOLLARS PER

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:28.799
YEAR. I WE WOULD KNOW THAT THIS

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:29.400
IS A NEW REVENUE STREAM WOULD

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.902
BE MORE VOLATILE THAN THE

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.704
EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.473
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE MORE

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:39.744
CLOSELY TIED. TO FLUCTUATIONS.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:43.481
IT'S AND OF SOMEWHAT OFFSETTING

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:44.248
THE INCREASE FROM THE SHIP IN A

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:46.016
REAL PROPERTY TO WOULD BE A

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:47.051
REDUCTION IN THIS PERSONAL

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:49.286
TAXES PAID BY BUSINESSES WE

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:50.621
ESTIMATE THAT UNDER THE

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.389
MEASURES PROVISIONS BUSINESS

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.924
PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS

00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:55.726
WOULD BE REDUCED BY SEVERAL

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:56.894
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:59.363
YEAR. THE MEASURE ALSO SETS

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.932
ASIDE FROM THE NEW- REVENUE

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.868
MONIES TO COVER VARIOUS COSTS

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.770
RELATED TO THE MEASURE- THIS

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:07.471
INCLUDES PROVIDING SEVERAL

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.206
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.374
TO COUNTING IS. TO COVER THEIR

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.042
COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THE

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:15.513
MEASURE. SO AFTER OFFSETTING-

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.214
THE BUSINESS PERSONAL PROPERTY

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.249
REDUCTIONS AND THE COST OF THE

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.785
MEASURE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:21.952
MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE SOMEWHERE

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.021
BETWEEN SIX POINT FIVE AND

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.923
ELEVEN POINT FIVE. BILLION IN A

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.291
NEW PROPERTY TAX REVENUE TO

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:28.726
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOLS

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:31.562
EACH YEAR- THIS FUNDING WOULD

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:34.498
BE SPLIT 60% TO CITIES COUNTIES

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:36.467
AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ARE WITH

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:38.536
EACH PARTICULAR LOCALITY IS-

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.971
SHARE BEING VARYING BASED ON A

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:41.939
NUMBER OF FACTORS AND IT WOULD

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.507
VERY ACROSS REGIONS OF THE

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.943
STATE AS WELL. THE REMAINING

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.479
40% WOULD GO TO SCHOOLS AND

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:49.814
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THOSE

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.882
ALLOCATIONS INDIVIDUAL

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:57.288
REFLECT THE PEOPLE ALLOCATIONS

EXISTING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:03.294
FORMULA WITHIN THAT

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:03.928
INTRODUCTION OF THE MEASURE I'D

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:24.849
BE HAPPY TO. QUESTIONS. SEASON

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:28.519
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. YEAH

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.287
HELLO I USED TO BE ON THE

BUNDLE CITY COUNCIL AND I KNOW

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.024
THAT OUR CITY IS A- KNOWN LOW

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:36.026
PROPERTY TAX CITY SO WE GET

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.261
VERY LITTLE PROPERTY TAX

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:39.763
REVENUE. AND I WANT TO KNOW

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.498
THAT WHETHER OR NOT TO ALL

00:41:41.565 --> 00:41:42.967
GOVERNMENTS OF SCHOOLS RECEIVE

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:44.602
AN EQUAL SHAREOF THE NEW TAX

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.203
REVENUE FROM THIS MEASURE. WELL

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.371
THE MAJORITY OF THE NEW TAX

REVENUE CODE OF. MORE WEALTHY

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.376
JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE HIGH

VALUE PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED.

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:58.449
YES THERE'S- KIND OF THEIRS AND

00:41:58.515 --> 00:41:59.550
AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A NUMBER

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.185
OF FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT THE

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:04.021

00:42:04.088 --> 00:42:06.156
WHAT IS EACH LOCALITIES CURRENT

SHARE OF THE PROPERTY TAX. AND

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.961
HOW MUCH NEW REVENUE WILL BE

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:13.797
GENERATED- BY THE SHIFT TO

00:42:13.864 --> 00:42:15.366
MARKET VALUE TAXATION FOR

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.600

YEAH SO THE MEASURE- VERY

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:20.183
CLEARLY- EXEMPTS AGRICULTURAL

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.719
LAND FROM THE SHIP TO MARKET

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:25.455
VALUE TAXATION- AS FOR OTHER

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.657
KINDS OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:29.526
RELATED TO AGRICULTURE- IF

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:33.430
THOSE PROPERTIES HAVE A-

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:36.633
COMMERCIAL USE- THAN THIS

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.668
MEASURE LIKELY WOULD SHIFT

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:40.470
THOSE PROPERTIES TO A MARKET

00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:44.741
VALUE TAXATION. AND THEN SO

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.810
JUST TO BE CLEAR ALSO IS IF

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:49.012

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.739
SMALL BUSINESSES LEASE THE

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:37.306
PROPERTY WHERE THEY CONDUCT

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.842
BUSINESS. COULD CERTAIN SMALL

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.344
BUSINESSES STILL BE AFFECTED IF

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.845
THE PROPERTY WHERE THEY CONDUCT

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.714
BUSINESS DOES NOT FALL WITHIN

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.015
THE SMALL BUSINESS DOES

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:56.525
BUSINESS EXEMPTION. THIS IS TEN

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.093
GAUGE I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:04:57.159 --> 01:05:02.565
THAT QUESTION- SO THE AS I

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.333
MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY THE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.037
VAST MAJORITY OF. SMALL

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.505
BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.841
OUR OTHER HOME BASED FOR ALL

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:14.110
THE RIGHT PROPERTY A RELATIVELY

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.912
SMALLER PROPORTION RENT THEIR

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:19.081
PROPERTY. AND PART OF THE

01:05:19.148 --> 01:05:20.650
DESIGN OF THE MEASURE WAS TO

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.318
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TIME FOR

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:27.823
THOSE. RENTERS BUSINESS RENTERS

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.625
TO NEGOTIATE- RENEGOTIATE THEIR

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:33.496
LEASES BEFORE THE PROPERTY IS

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:37.867
REASSESS SO- THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:40.102
I MENTIONED MY COMMENT

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.772
BASICALLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:45.608
EXTEND A PHASE IN PERIOD- UNDER

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.143
THE MEASURE IT'S A MINIMUM OF

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.111
THREE YEARS- BUT THEY CAN

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:52.648
EXPAND THAT FURTHER. THE

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:53.749
INTENTION OTHER THE MEASURE

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:56.152
WOULD BE- TO FOCUS ON

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.653
PROPERTIES WERE THE GREATEST

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.589
DISPARITY IN TERMS OF- THE GAP

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.825
BETWEEN ASSESSED VALUE IN

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:06.762
MARKET VALUE AND SO. MANY OF

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:09.298
THE SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD WRAP

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:10.700
WOULD HAVE AS A STAY A

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.301
SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME IN

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:14.236
WHICH TO RENEGOTIATE THEIR

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:18.441
LEASES. CURRENTLY THE LEASES

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:19.809
THAT THEY PAY YOU ARE

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.378
DETERMINED BY THE MARKET. AND

01:06:22.445 --> 01:06:24.647
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY-

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.850
BUSINESS HAS A VERY OLD-

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.618
PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT I DON'T

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:30.653
BASE YOUR VALUE UNDER

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.856
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. AND AS

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.392
CONSEQUENCES LOW PROPERTY TAXES.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.460
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD THEY'RE NOT

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.829
PASSING THOSE SAVINGS THROUGH

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.398
TO THEIR RENTERS BECAUSE- RENTS

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:45.134
ARE DETERMINED BY THE MARKET.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:49.071
AND SO WHEN THAT KIND OF ORDER-

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:53.175
IS RE ASSESSED BUSINESSES THAT

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:55.311
RAN FROM THAT ORDER WILL BE IN

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.279
A POSITION TO SHOP AROUND IN

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.815
THE MARKET- BECAUSE THE MARKET

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.751
IN EFFECT IS WHAT HAS WHAT HAS

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:05.454
DETERMINED- ACOSTA THE RENT NOT

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:06.889
THAT- PROPERTY TAX RATE THAT

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:10.760
THE OWNER IS PAYING. OKAY THANK

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:15.531
YOU MY LAST QUESTION IF IT OVER.

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:18.267
THIS IS CAROLYN GRAY IF I MAY

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:21.337
I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD ON I'M IN

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.406
RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION

01:07:23.472 --> 01:07:26.776
THREE- I THINK THAT THIS

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.445
QUESTION LEAD TO AND HOW IT WAS

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.848
JUST ANSWERED- THAT NEEDS TO.

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:36.218
BE UNDER SCORED IT BECAUSE-

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:37.920
BILLS THAT LANDLORDS THAT HAVE

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:39.822
PROPERTIES FOR THEIR PAIN LOWER

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:41.690
TAX AND THEY ARE NOT RULING

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:44.760
INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:46.829
I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.664
DECADE THE DEGREE THAT MAN IN

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:54.437
THE UNITY AND ESPECIALLY THOSE.

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.272
IN BLACK AND OTHER. COLOR AND

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.474
SO IT WILL LAST CRITICAL

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.776
SERVICE GAS SUCH AS EMERGENCY

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.345
BUT BY PUBLIC HEALTH OR- SCHOOL

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.613
ON THE THEIR OWN AND FUNDING

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.048
DOING MY PART TO THE BROKEN

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:09.452
PROPERTY TAX. AND SO I THINK-

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:12.087
BACK NEEDS TO BE UNDERSCORED

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:19.028
HERE. THANK YOU AND I HAVE ONE

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.529
LAST QUESTION WHICH I NORMALLY

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.965
GET ASKED BY MANY OF MY LOCAL

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:24.600
AGENCIES BUT ARE THERE ANY

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.268
RESTRICTIONS ON HOW LOCAL

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:32.528
DISINGENUOUS THAT WHEN PEOPLE

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.546
MISREADING A MEASURE TO THINK

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.048
THAT SCHOOLS ARE THE LOWEST

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.151
PRIORITY- THEY'RE NOT- THE

AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING TO

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.155

CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST FISCAL

CHALLENGES I DON'T THINK

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:57.425
ANYBODY DISPUTES THAT WE ARE SO

01:19:57.492 --> 01:19:59.094
OVERLY RELIANT ON A HANDFUL OF

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.662
WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS THAT AND

01:20:00.729 --> 01:20:02.631
BOOM TIMES REVENUE JUST COMES

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.232
FLOWING IN THE DOOR BUT IN

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.968
RECESSIONARY TIMES THE DROP. IS

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:09.538
PARTICULARLY SEVERE INDEED

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.573
REVENUE VOLATILITY IS SUCH A

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:12.240
LARGE PROBLEM THE GOVERNOR

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.109
SCHWARZENEGGER CREATED THE

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:15.477
CALIFORNIA COMMISSION FOR THE

ALSO KNOWS THE PARTS THE

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:19.047
COMMISSION TO COME UP WITH

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:20.982
SOLUTIONS REGRETTABLY THERE WAS

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.517
BROAD CONSENSUS THAT REVENUE

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:24.319
VOLATILITY IS IN FACT ONE OF

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:25.921
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS. BUT

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.422
UNFORTUNATELY THE COMMISSIONERS

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.523
COULD NOT COME UP WITH A

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:30.091
SOLUTION. BUT DURING THE

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.493
COMMISSION'S HEARING PROCESS

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.928

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:42.003
OF VOLATILITY IN INCOME TAXES.

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.471
NOT SO MUCH VOLATILITY IN SALES

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.774
TAXES BUT STILL PRONOUNCED AN

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.009
EXTRAORDINARY STABILITY IN THE

AGGREGATE COULD NOT BE TAX

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.396
BECAUSE THE 2% LIMITATION.

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.764
PROVIDED A HUGE CUSHION TO

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.167

IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVE OUR

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:40.415
CONCLUSION IS WE CANNOT. IT

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:41.883
WOULD E IMPOSSIBLE NOT

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.551
DIFFICULT BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:44.819

SPLIT LAUREL INITIATING. THE

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.331
BIG PROBLEM FOR ASSESSORS AS

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:59.768
MANY IS THE MANY EXCLUSIONS. A

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:02.003
REASSESSMENT IN THE INITIATIVE.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:03.004
FOR EXAMPLE IF IT EXCLUDES

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.472
REASSESSMENT OF SMALL

01:24:04.539 --> 01:24:07.041
BUSINESSES SOUNDS GOOD. WELL

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:08.643
MOST SMALL BUSINESSES DON'T OWN

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.578
PROPERTY THEY PAY THE PROPERTY

01:24:10.645 --> 01:24:12.380
TAXES THROUGH THEIR LEAKS SO

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:14.849
MOST ALL SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.351
WOULD NOT GET THE BENEFIT OF

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:18.486
THE EXCLUSION. THE SPLIT ROLE

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.188
EXCLUDES OWNER OCCUPIED

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:21.689
PROPERTY IN WHICH THE FAIR

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:24.058
MARKET VALUE IS LESS THAN THREE

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:26.728
MILLION STATE WHY. FIRST A SET

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.598

CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OR NEW

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:34.002
CONSTRUCTION AFTER THAT WE ONLY

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.670
TRACK ASSESSED BALLOT.

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.505
ASSESSORS CANNOT DETERMINE THE

COUNTS. THERE'S ALSO A RELATED

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:46.948
PROBLEM THE THREE MILLION CAP

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:48.383
THE THREE MILLION DOLLAR CAP IS

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:51.019
ADJUSTED BY ANNUALLY BY COUNTY

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.554
BASED UPON A LOCAL INFLATION

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.322
FACTOR DETERMINED BY THE STATE

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:56.024
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THE

01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:58.493
RESULT IS OVER TIME DIFFERENT

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.195
INFLATION FACTORS IN DIFFERENT

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:02.263
COUNTIES SO YOU CAN HAVE

OR FOUR MILES APART WITH

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:11.306
DIFFERENT INFLATION FACTOR. THE

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:14.008
RESULT EXACT PROPERTIES WILL

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.109
EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT ASSESSED

01:25:15.176 --> 01:25:18.346
VALUES OVER TIME. FOR THE PAST

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:19.447
THREE YEARS ASSESSORS HAVE DONE

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:20.982
A DEEP DIVE INTO THE FINANCIAL

01:25:21.049 --> 01:25:25.119
pSPLIT ROLE. FIRST WE SURVEYED

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.621
ASSESSORS REGARDING THE IMPACT

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:28.623
THE SPLIT ROLE WOULD HAVE ON

MATRIX WHICH CONCLUDED THAT ARE

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.833
ESTIMATES WERE WAY LOW. AND

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.235
THAT THE ESTIMATED COST TO

IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVE OVER

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.238
THE COURSE OF THE PROPOSED

THREE YEAR PHASE IN. IS JUST

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:47.342
OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS STATE

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:49.444
WHY AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:50.512
THE COMMENSURATE INCREASE IN

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:53.014
COST. FOR COUNTY CONTROLLERS

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:54.482

COUNCIL. THE BALLOT MEASURE

01:25:58.386 --> 01:25:59.921
REQUIRES AS WE KNOW THE

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.789
REASSESSMENT OF ALL COMMERCIAL.

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:04.025

DURING THE GREAT RECESSION

01:26:14.335 --> 01:26:16.538
REQUIRING ANNUAL REVIEW OF EACH

THE FIRST YEAR. IT WOULD BE

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.539
IMPOSSIBLE FOR SANTA CLARA

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:24.072
IN THE COST OF RESOLVING APPEAL.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:27.308
IT TAKES ME FIVE YEARS TO TAKE

SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE A CHEAT

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.936
IT JUST INCREASES THE MISTRUST

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:55.536
AND CYNICISM THAT THE PUBLIC

01:27:55.603 --> 01:27:57.338
HAS TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:59.407
ELECTED OFFICIALS THIS IS A

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.309
SERIOUSLY FLAWED BALLOT MEASURE

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:03.111

HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:12.387
MEMBER BURKE DRAWING GO FIRST I

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.355
HAVE ACTUALLY THREE QUESTIONS

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:15.089
MY FIRST QUESTIONS FOR THE LA

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:18.393
L. ONE OF THE OPPONENTS BROUGHT

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.895
UP THE FACT THAT THE TRIPLE NET

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.397
LEASES WILL HAVE AFFECTS ON

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.598
SMALL BUSINESSES AND MY

01:28:23.665 --> 01:28:25.199
QUESTION WOULD BE HAS YOUR

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.535
ANALYSIS TAKEN THAT INTO- INTO

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.836
CONSIDERATION WHICH I KNOW YOU

01:28:28.903 --> 01:28:30.672
DID MENTION IT DOES BUT HOW.

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.707
AND THEN ALSO DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:34.042
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THAT

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.276
RELIEF WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:37.879
SMALL BUSINESSES IF IN FACT-

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.313
THAT TRIPLE NET LEASE OBVIOUSLY

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.883
WOULD INCREASE THE COST TO

01:28:41.949 --> 01:28:44.585
SMALL BUSINESS. YES THANK YOU

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:48.056
SO THE PRIMARY CHARGE OF OUR-

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:50.658
ANALYSIS IS TO LOOK AT THE

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:54.128
MEASURES FISCAL FAX- ECONOMIC

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:56.097
EFFECTS OF THE MEASURE- CAN

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.633
PLAY INTO- THE ESTIMATES OF THE

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.667
PHYSICAL BUT THEY ARE KIND OF

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:03.738
THE- THE PRIMARY- ANALYSIS FOR

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:06.007
A MEASURE SO. QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.310
HOW KIND OF ECONOMIC POLICY

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:10.678
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.914
AFFECT SMALL BUSINESSES WERE

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:13.915
WERE NOT REALLY WITHIN THE

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.983
PURVIEW OF ESTIMATING THE

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.952
PROPERTY TAX AFFECTS FROM THE

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:22.523
MEASURE. THANK YOU I MEAN WOULD

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:25.526
YOU A TEST THAT. POTENTIALLY

01:29:25.593 --> 01:29:26.761
BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE OF THAT

01:29:26.828 --> 01:29:28.563
TRAFFIC TROUBLE NEED NOT LEASE

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.798
COSTS THAT SMALL BUSINESS WOULD

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:33.134
BE AFFECTED. ALTHOUGH THE PROP

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.335
UP OTHER THE PROPOSITION WAS

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.937
WRITTEN TO TRY NOT TO THINK

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:36.871
SMALL BUSINESS OR WOULD BE

01:29:36.938 --> 01:29:37.805
STILL AND AFFECT ON SMALL

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:41.743
BUSINESS. I THINK I WOULD SAY

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:44.846
THAT- IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:46.814
THAT THERE COULD BE BUSINESSES

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:47.415
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED SMALL

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:50.685
BUSINESS- THAT COULD BE A

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:52.887
RENTING THEIR SPACE- IN A

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.622
BUILDING. THAT WOULD NOT BE

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:56.824
EXEMPT UNDER THIS THIS MEASURE

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:57.525
FROM THE SHIFT TO A MARKET

01:29:57.592 --> 01:30:01.963
VALUE TAXATION- AND- DESPITE

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:06.300
TEN GAUGES. I THINK FAIRLY A

01:30:06.367 --> 01:30:08.369
REASONABLE REMARKS ABOUT A

01:30:08.436 --> 01:30:11.439
COMMERCIAL RENTS BEING SET BY

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:13.040
LARGELY BY KIND OF MOVE THE

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.076
MARKET RATES THERE COULD

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:17.011
POTENTIALLY BE SOME SITUATIONS

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:19.580
WHERE. LANDLORDS FACING

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:21.582
PROPERTY TAX INCREASES COULD

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:24.752
SEEK TO RENEGOTIATE LEASES OVER

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:27.321
TIME OKAY THANK YOU. ARE MY

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:29.223
NEXT QUESTION IS TO THE

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:32.126
OPPONENTS SOME PEOPLE CONTEND

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.161
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.096
EQUITABLY FAVORS LONGSTANDING

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.531
BUSINESSES OVER NEWER

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:37.965

PERPETUAL COME AT PERPETUAL

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:41.769
COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE-

01:30:41.836 --> 01:30:43.037
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PROPERTIES

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.539
ARE SOLD IN THE PAST AND THE

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:46.374
WAY THAT PROPERTIES ARE SOLD-

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.142
IN THEIR DEALS COULD YOU

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:50.812
RESPOND TO THAT CRITICISM. NOT

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:54.148
THE ONLY OF THE OPPONENTS. WELL

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:56.517
THERE YEAH BECAUSE THE PROPERTY

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:59.620
TAX SYSTEM IS SO DIVERSE

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:00.755
DEPENDING ON HOW LONG YOU'VE

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:02.824
OWNED YOUR PROPERTY IF YOU'RE A

01:31:02.890 --> 01:31:05.193
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNER-

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:08.029
THERE IS TREMENDOUS DISPARITY.

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:10.031
IN HIS SO WHEN YOU TRY TO Q.

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:12.800
OR- THOSE DISPARITIES WITH ONE

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.736
BALLOT MANAGER AT ONE TIME IT

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:17.104
CREATES IT WILL CREATE

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.906
TREMENDOUS DESTRUCTION IN THE

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:21.209
SYSTEM. LBC WINNERS THEY'LL BE

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:25.746
LOSERS- AND- I MEAN THAT'S THE

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:26.314
ONLY WAY I CAN ANSWER YOUR

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.616
QUESTION I THINK. I THINK- AND

01:31:28.683 --> 01:31:31.452
THEN FOR THE PROPONENTS CAN YOU

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN- THIS

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:00.348
MEASURE IS A RE WRITE OF A

WITH- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS SO

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.922
FOR EXAMPLE- THE CONCERN THAT

CONVENE A TASK FORCE FOR THE

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.471
PURPOSE OF. LOOKING AT WHAT

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:24.305
WOULD BE INVOLVED IN

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.574

THAT TASK FORCE AND THE

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:33.381
LEGISLATURE- AS I MENTIONED

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:35.983
EARLIER. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:38.786
STAND- PHASE IN PERIOD- SO IN

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.621
THE MEASURE RIGHT NOW IT'S A

MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THERE

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:51.499
HAS TO BE AT LEAST A THREE YEAR

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.301
PHASE IN PERIOD BUT THE STATE

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:55.169
LEGISLATURE COULD EXTEND THAT.

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.171
BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:32:57.238 --> 01:33:01.108
ASSESSORS- SECOND- THE CONCERNS

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:06.213
RAISED ABOUT COST- TWO COMMENTS

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.450
ONE IS I THINK MR STUFF. LA THE

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:12.520
US OF COP WE HAVE NOT LOOKED

01:33:12.586 --> 01:33:14.055
SPECIFICALLY- OR MADE AN

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:15.723
ESTIMATE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:18.292
START UP COSTS-WOULD BE BUT WE

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:19.527
DID LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF

01:33:19.593 --> 01:33:20.895
WHAT THE ON GOING COSTS WOULD

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.763
BE IN OUR BEST SENSE IS THAT

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:24.498
THEY WOULD BE LESS THAN A

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:25.366
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:27.601
YEAR. ONCE THE MEASURES THAT.

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:29.503
WITH RESPECT TO THE- START UP

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.472
COSTS WHOEVER HAS THE MEASURE

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.074
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.575
MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT THE

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.944
LEGISLATURE. IS TO PROVIDE A

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:38.379
GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.780
THE START COSTS WHICH WOULD

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.415
THEN BE PAID BACK FROM THE

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:44.452
REVENUES GENERATED BY THE

01:33:44.518 --> 01:33:46.654
MEASURE ITSELF SO. THAT THE-

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:48.489
RELATE TO OR THE CONCERN

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:53.227
RELATED TO START UP COSTS- SIX

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.929
THREE ONE WITHOUT A- FOUNDATION

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.831
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THOSE START

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.899
UP COSTS ARE ALL COVERED BY THE

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:00.835

WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE- WE

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.883
UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN WE MADE

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:18.085
CHANGES. IN THE MEASURE TO THE

WAY IN WHICH THE ASSESSMENT

01:34:19.453 --> 01:34:20.654

PURPOSE OF. TRYING TO REDUCE

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:29.096
THE- NUMBER OF APPEALS WOULD BE

ALL IT IS THAT THAT. THAT SO

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:08.095
WHEN THAT HAPPENS THOSE SMALL

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:10.965
COUNTIES WOULD BE VERY RETICENT

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:14.702
ABOUT YEAH FRONT MONEY VIA THE

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.837
START UP COSTS WHEN THEY COULD

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.306
GET THEY HAD NO EXPECTATION

WHOLE IDEA PARTICULARLY IN THE

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:28.015
IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT WE

01:36:28.082 --> 01:36:29.783
HAVE IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW

PARTICULAR- TO FRONT COST.

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:47.768
SIGNIFICANT COST TO START. THIS

COSTS IT'S LIKELY THAT MOST

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:00.447
BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ARE NOT

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.650
GOING TO DO THAT. I APPRECIATE

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:04.585
THAT ASSESSOR STONE IN TERMS OF

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.253

FRONTING MONEY AND SOME OF THE

01:37:09.256 --> 01:37:10.558
DIFFICULTIES THERE BUT THERE'S

01:37:10.624 --> 01:37:12.126
NOTHING IN THE MEASURE THAT

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:14.395
WOULD PREVENT. ALL OF OUR

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:16.197
COUNTIES FROM FROM BEING MADE

01:37:16.263 --> 01:37:18.732

THIS THIS NEW BURGER CORRECT I

01:37:23.737 --> 01:37:26.273
MEAN THIS THIS. THERE'S A

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.775
FLEXIBILITY THERE TO RECOUP

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:29.376
THOSE COSTS OVER TIME I

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.312
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT UP FRONT

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:33.380
CONCERNED HOWEVER BRICK BUT

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:34.648
THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:37.585
PREVENT YOU FROM RECOUPING ALL

OF THOSE COSTS OVER TIME

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:40.654
CORRECT. IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.456
REVENUE IS GOING TO COME IN AS

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:44.458
I SAID I BELIEVE IN THE

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:47.528
ASSESSORS BELIEVE. THAT THAT

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:50.698
THAT THE PROJECTIONS ON SIX TO

ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.734
DOLLARS WORTH OF REVENUE IS NOT

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:56.437
GOING TO BE. ANYWHERE NEAR THAT

01:37:56.503 --> 01:37:58.205
AT THE END OF THE DAY AND THE

01:37:58.272 --> 01:38:01.909
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS OF THE

01:38:01.976 --> 01:38:06.513
CHEATING THAT- THERE'S I THINK.

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.815
COUNTIES WOULD BE RESIDENT

DISTRICTS THAT HAVE MOVED OUT

OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

THE NOTION THAT THE BUSINESS

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:30.150
SMALLER SHARE. OF THE PROPERTY

GAUGE A LITTLE BIT. THAT IS

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.827
DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY LAND

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:42.563
KEEPS KEEP IN MIND SINCE

01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:43.030

OUR INDUSTRIAL BASE HAS SHRUNK.

01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:50.904
SO THE PROPORTION. OF PROPERTY

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:52.873
TAX REVENUE RELATIVE BETWEEN

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.209
COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL IS

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:58.011
REALLY AN AN IRRELEVANT. FIGURE

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:00.414
BECAUSE IS DRIVEN MORE BY LAND

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:06.687
USE POLICIES NOT TAX POLICY.

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:07.187
ANY OTHER COMMENT TO MY

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:12.059

YOU YOU HAD- ASKED FOR COMMENT

WITH RESPECT TO-

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.565
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND ONE OF THE

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:19.433
THINGS THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:21.335
DISCUSSED THIS MUCH MUCH THUS

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:25.172
FAR. IN TODAY'S- HEARING IS THE

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:27.774
FACT THAT BECAUSE THE

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:28.942
REASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:31.078
PROPERTY WOULD RESULT IN A

01:42:31.144 --> 01:42:33.914
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND THE

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:36.350
PROPERTY TAX BASE THAT TAKES

01:42:36.416 --> 01:42:38.385
TAX BASED NOT ONLY HAS THE ONE

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.454
PERCENT- TAX APPLIED TO IT BUT

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:43.790
ALSO THE- VOTER OVERRIDE RATE.

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:47.060
AS A CONSEQUENCE- THIS WOULD

01:42:47.127 --> 01:42:49.596
INCREASE THE FISCAL CAPACITY

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:51.131
THE STATE TO SUPPORT

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.332
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A FAIRLY

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:55.269
SUBSTANTIAL FASHION- AYE

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:56.470
MITCHELL LITTLE EARLIER MY

01:42:56.537 --> 01:42:59.006
REMARKS THAT THEN SCHOOLS LOCAL

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:00.507
GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE IN A

01:43:00.574 --> 01:43:03.610
POSITION. TO PROVIDE MORE IN

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:04.978
THE WAY OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.413
PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.749
COMMUNITIES WHERE- MANY OF

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.951
THOSE FACILITIES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:14.655
PROVIDED. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:15.923
MORE QUESTIONS AND ONE HANDED

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:19.393
OFF TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUNE.

01:43:19.459 --> 01:43:20.894
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.863
INITIATIVE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS

01:43:22.930 --> 01:43:24.031
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IS

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:25.933
INVOLVED SAID YET OPPONENTS

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:27.801
MATERIALS AND WEBSITES HAVE

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.470
CALL THIS INITIATIVE AND ATTACK

01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:32.005
ON HOMEOWNERS. WOULD YOU CALL

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.106
THAT STATEMENT CORRECT AND

01:43:33.173 --> 01:43:39.713
ACCURATE. OF THIS IS THE THIS

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:43.183
DRUG POLICY YES I THINK AGAIN

01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:44.551
WE HAVE PUBLIC STATEMENTS

01:43:44.618 --> 01:43:46.553
WHICH- WE CAN CERTAINLY MAKE

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:47.988
AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE FROM

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.890
PROPONENTS ARE INTEREST SOCIO

01:43:49.957 --> 01:43:52.059
THE PERFORMANCE- COMING OUT AND

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.594
SAYING QUITE CLEARLY THAT THIS

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.028
IS THE FIRST STEP IF ANYBODY

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:57.631
BELIEVES. THE LAWSUIT

01:43:57.698 --> 01:43:59.499
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN FOR

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:00.734
BUSINESS PROPERTIES IS SIMPLY

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.936
THE FIRST STEP I THINK I THINK

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:05.172
THERE'D BE FLOWN SO. I THINK

01:44:05.238 --> 01:44:06.306
THERE IS A CLEAR AGENDA HERE

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:10.777
TO- DISMANTLE ALL THE PROJECT

01:44:10.844 --> 01:44:13.981
PROPOSITION THIRTY. FOR THE

01:44:14.047 --> 01:44:16.383
EFFORT THE NFIB REPORTS OF MOST

01:44:16.450 --> 01:44:17.818
SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATE FROM

01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:20.220
THEIR HOME SO WHAT THE SAME

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:25.325
SMALL BUSINESSES BE EXAM. UNDER

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.660
THE MEASURE THEY WOULD BE YES

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:32.899
MADAM CHAIRMAN. ANY OTHER

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:36.837
COMMENT. I GUESS THE QUESTION I

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.572
WOULD HAVE IS IT FOR A HOME

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:41.675
BASED BUSINESS- WHAT IS THE

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.210
PENALTY FOR NOT SECURING YOUR

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:46.680
BUSINESS LICENSE AND- IN IN OUR

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.048
IT AS THERE IS A SHIFT TOWARD

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:50.217
HOME BASED BUSINESSES ARE

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.351
THEY'RE GONNA BE ZONING

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:53.487
RESTRICTIONS AND ARE THEY GOING

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:56.790
TO BE ENFORCEMENT OF. GENERAL

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.358
PLANNING AND ZONING LAWS WITH

01:44:58.425 --> 01:45:00.360
RESPECT TO OPERATING A BUSINESS

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.396
OUT OF YOUR HOME THERE SO. I

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:03.497
THINK THAT'S ONE THING THE HOME

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.165
BASED BUSINESSES DO FEAR AND

01:45:05.232 --> 01:45:08.268
THAT IS OF THE FACT THAT- SOME

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:09.703
OF THE ENFORCEMENT DISEASE WILL

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:12.272
BE LOOKING TO SEE. WHO HAS A

01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:14.174
BUSINESS LICENSE AND WHAT WHAT

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:15.409
HAVE THEY IDENTIFIED AS THEIR

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.511
ADDRESS AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:18.178
OPERATING A BUSINESS IS

01:45:18.245 --> 01:45:20.113
CONSISTENT. WITH THE LAND USE

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:22.215
POLICIES OF THAT CITY SO I

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.550
THINK THAT'S A CONCERN THAT

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.752
WOULD ALL HAVE TO LOOK. LOOK AT

01:45:25.819 --> 01:45:29.956
GOING FORWARD. IN MY LAST SURE

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:32.893
I NAY YES IT IF I NAY CAROLING

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.428
GREAT HERE. I THINK THAT WE

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:36.029
HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT THE RICH

01:45:36.096 --> 01:45:38.932
THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN. THAT

01:45:38.999 --> 01:45:41.635
78% OF THE REVENUE HERE WE'LL

01:45:41.702 --> 01:45:44.671
COME FROM IT 6% OF THE MOST

01:45:44.738 --> 01:45:46.673
VALUABLE. COMMERCIAL AND

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:47.474
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY IN THE

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:50.043
STATE. AND I THINK THAT IT IS

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.845
NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT THE

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:55.182
WEALTHIER. AND COUNTIES ARE I'M

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.818
PUSHING BACK ON THERE IF THE-

01:45:57.884 --> 01:46:01.455
IF THEY WOULD HAVE TO IS BACK

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:03.590
UP. SHARE WE NEED TO INCLUDE

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:06.193
CLOSE IN THE MEDIAN IN WE NEED

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:08.762
THE- REASON WHY BUSINESSES. OUT

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:11.098
OF THEIR HOME THEY SPEAK.

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:13.433
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY THAT VERY

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:16.503
RATE THAT BY THE MARKET NOT BY

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.706
THE PROPERTY TAX. AND WE DO NOT

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:20.874
LEAVE THE HOLDERS THAT THE

01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:24.144
PROPERTY PASSING PROPERTY TAX

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.612
BEIJING ON THE TOPIC THAT THEY

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.547
DON'T DO THAT WE NEED AN

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:29.316
INVESTMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS AND

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:36.890
IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE.
