CALTRANS CAN RESPOND BECAUSE I

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:37.242

THE L. L. A. FOCUSED ON HERE

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.914

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.121
ASSUME THIS IS PRIMARILY-

EXEMPTED THERE AS WELL. THAT'S

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:10.876

00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.816
STOLEN AND THE FRAUDSTERS USE

00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:53.584
THOSE IDENTITIES TO FILE FALSE

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:55.286
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS.

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:56.353
UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEAVES THE

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.956
VICTIM OF IDENTITY THEFT WITH

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:01.292
THE TAX LIABILITY. EDT CAN HELP

THOSE VICTIMS- CLEAR THAT TAX

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.129
LIABILITY BUT THEY NEED AN

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.997
AVAILABLE RESOURCE AT U. D. D.

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:09.099
TO CONTACT DVD ENTERTAINMENT

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:10.267
ASSISTANCE THAT'S WHY WE

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.769
RECOMMENDED ET DE SET UP A

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.671
DEDICATED LINE. TO COMMUNICATE

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:15.105
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:16.974
INEFFICIENT PROCESS WITH THE

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.475
RIGHT KIND OF STAFFING TO

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.411
PROCESS THAT WORKLOAD. WE CAN

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:21.912
SAY THAT FOR RIGHT NOW EASIEST

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:23.247
ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS NOW

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:23.981
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:25.749
CONTINUE TO PAY ATTENTION TO

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.484
THAT WORKLOAD OVER TIME AS IT

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:28.485
MIGHT FLUCTUATE IN THE COMING

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:30.487
MONTHS BUT WE ARE. SAYING THAT

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:31.856
FOR NOW THEY FULLY IMPLEMENTED

00:41:31.922 --> 00:41:34.592
THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:35.726
VERY IMPORTANT AREA. SO THAT'S

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.461
GOOD PROGRESS THAT HE'S MAKING.

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:39.263
ACCORDING TO THE TIMELINE THAT

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.764
WE EXPECTED IT TO.

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:41.832
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ALSO A

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.400
COUPLE KEY AREAS I WANT TO

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.969
HIGHLIGHT WHERE EDT IS NOT ON

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.737
TRACK WITH WHERE WE EXPECTED

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.505
THEM TO BE BY NOW IN THOSE TWO

00:41:48.572 --> 00:41:50.040
AREAS THAT I'LL HIGHLIGHT FOR

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.242
THE COMMITTEE OR IN THE AREA OF

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:54.245
WORKFORCE AND WORKLOAD PLANNING.

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.413
AND THEN- THE CREATION OF A

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.049
FRAUD- UNIT. FIRST ON WORKFORCE

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:00.684
AND WORKLOAD PLANNING SO DURING

00:42:00.751 --> 00:42:02.152
OUR AUDIT WE FOUND SOME

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:04.488
CONCERNS RELATED TO HOW EASY

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.557
WAS ANTICIPATING. UPCOMING

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.826
WORKLOAD- WE SAW THAT IT WAS

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.261
TRYING TO ANTICIPATED UPCOMING

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:12.463
WORKLOAD. BASED ESSENTIALLY ON

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:15.332
HISTORICAL DATA. NOT ON. A

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:16.700
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:18.135
ARE COMING OVER THE PAST FEW

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.937
WEEKS BUT THAT UNFORTUNATELY.

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:21.405
ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE SOMETIMES

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:23.173
THE WORKLOAD WILL INCREASE-

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.975
BASED ON SEASONAL FLUCTUATION

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.111
OR OTHER ECONOMIC INDICATORS SO

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:28.345
WE WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR EDT

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:29.480
TO DEVELOP A BETTER WORKLOAD

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.482
PROJECTION MODEL. AND THAT'S AN

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.449
AREA WHERE THEY STILL HAVEN'T

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:35.619
MADE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.187
SECONDARILY WE HAD CONCERNS

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.856
ABOUT AN AMPLE LARGE IMPENDING

00:42:38.923 --> 00:42:40.157
WORKLOAD THAT YOU DO IS ALSO

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.259
GOING TO NEED TO MANAGE WHILE

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:43.627
IT SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE THAT

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.062
IT CONTINUED TO PAY TIMELY

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.697
BENEFITS. AND THAT IS THE

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.165
DEFERRED WORK THAT UNITY WAS

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:49.967
NOT PERFORMING DURING THE HEART

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:51.869
AT THAT PART OF THE PANDEMIC

00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:53.404
PERIOD. BUT FOR WHICH THE

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.705
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW EXPECTS

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:55.739
YOU NEEDED TO GO BACK AND

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.675
COMPLETE THAT'S A VERY LARGE

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.376
WORKLOAD WE WERE CONCERNED THAT

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:01.278
WITHOUT A VERY. STRUCTURED AND

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.213
RISK BASED PLAN FOR HOW YOU DO

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.815
THE WOULD. ADDRESS THAT

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.183
WORKLOAD IT WAS GOING TO

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.052
STRUGGLE TO ADEQUATELY OR

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:09.787
OPTIMALLY BALANCED IT'S

00:43:09.853 --> 00:43:12.389
COMPETING OBLIGATIONS. WITH

00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:12.990
RESPECT TO ALL THESE DIFFERENT

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:14.925
WORKLOADS. THEY NEED TO HAVE A

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.226
FIRM PLAN IN PLACE FOR HOW

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.227
THEY'RE GOING TO EFFECTIVELY

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.263
MANAGE THEIR STAFF. AND ALL OF

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.764
THESE IMPENDING WORKLOADS AND

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:21.999
THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE STILL

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:24.301
WANT TO SEE MORE PROGRESS FROM

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:25.769
EDT. I MENTIONED ALSO THE

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.538
COMPLETION OF A FRAUD UNIT IS

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:28.539
AN AREA WHERE WE DON'T FEEL

00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:29.773
LIKE EATING HE'S MADE ADEQUATE

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.508
PROGRESS AND RESPECTFULLY. WE

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.610
DO NOT AGREE THAT EDIE HAS

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:34.845
IMPLEMENTED THE RECOMMENDATION

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:36.513
TO CREATE A DEDICATED UNIT

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.949
FULLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:40.784
ITS FRAUD PREVENTION APPROACH.

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:41.919
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT BEST

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.620
PRACTICES WITH THE JUST EIGHTY

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:44.955

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.156
WERE DOING OUR AUDIT WAS A

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.658
FRAGMENTED APPROACH WHERE

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:48.859
VARIOUS UNITS. NEEDED TO

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.327
COORDINATE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.595
SOMETIMES DIDN'T DO SO

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.797
EFFECTIVELY. WE CAN SEE THAT

00:43:53.864 --> 00:44:05.042
EDT HAS TAKEN. SOME STEPS

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.642
TOWARDS CREATING THAT KIND OF

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:14.284
YOU KNOW. THEY. COMMITTEE MIGHT

WELL LET ME OUR FIRST SAY THAT-

00:47:58.075 --> 00:47:59.176
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE'VE

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.612
PUT IN A NEW DASHBOARD IS THAT

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.814
PEOPLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.083
PREVIOUS DASH DASH BOARD.

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:07.818
NUMBER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:10.354

NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE CLAIMANTS

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:46.456
TO UNDERSTAND. SO OFTEN THEY

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:46.957
MAKE MISTAKES IN THEIR

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:49.359

WANT TO MOVE TO THE FRAUD PART

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.382
OF IT I DO REALIZE THAT THERE

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.417
IS A DELICATE BALANCE TO. A

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:36.186
STOP AND INTENDED INDIVIDUALS

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.355
FROM GETTING BENEFITS- LIKE FOR

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.357
INSTANCE THE COUPLE ANDERSON

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.959
CARTY WHO WERE- VESTED BY

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:45.562
POLICE OFFICERS THEY FOUND OUT

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.364
THAT THEY READ AND- WELL LET'S

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.465
SEE HOW THAT THE THEY WERE

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:49.633
DOING DRUG TRAFFICKING HUMAN

00:52:49.699 --> 00:52:51.167
TRAFFICKING CREDIT CARD FRAUD

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:53.103
EDT FRAUD AND THEY ESTIMATED

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:55.405
THAT. THEY ACTUALLY APPLIED FOR

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:56.940
FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.042
IN EDP D. BENEFITS AND WERE

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:01.111
SUCCESSFUL IN WITHDRAWING TWO

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:04.414
POINT THREE EIGHT TWO. MILLION

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:06.950
DOLLARS IN EDT BENEFITS. AND I

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.151
DO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT

00:53:08.218 --> 00:53:10.253
OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.354
THAT MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:13.657
OF MONEY. BUT IS ONE OF THE

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:16.026
FRAUD MECHANISMS THAT YOU HAVE

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.528
IS- LOOKING AT CLAIMS MORE

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:21.998
SOPHISTICATED LEE IF FOR- A CAP

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.066
I MEAN IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.801
CAP. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.336
AVERAGE INCOME AND INDIVIDUALS

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.104
IN COMMUNITIES THAT. LIKE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:30.473
RESTAURANTS- A BARTENDER

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.609
SERVERS FOR THE HOTEL INDUSTRY

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:35.011
THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. IT

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:37.047
WOULD SET OFF AN ALARM IF

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.848
ANYBODY WAS WITHDRAWING-

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:41.051
APPLYING FOR FOUR POINT FIVE

00:53:41.117 --> 00:53:42.919
MILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS. IS

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:46.823
THERE A CALF A REASONABLE CAP

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.560
TO INVESTIGATE ON FRAUD- I MEAN

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:51.127
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.530
REASONABLE CAP IS I'M ASSUMING

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.397
SOMEBODY MAKES FIFTEEN DOLLARS

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:56.299
AN HOUR YOU KNOW FIFTY TWO

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.233
WEEKS FOR THE BENEFIT TO TOTAL

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.768
THAT OUT. BUT IF THERE IS

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.270
SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUALS DURING

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:02.072
YOU KNOW ONE ONE MILLION DOLLAR

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:05.976
CLAIMS PER SE IS THERE A CAP-

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.510
ON ANY TYPE OF THE BENEFITS IS

00:54:07.577 --> 00:54:08.878
THAT MAKES SENSE NOT A CAP TO

00:54:08.945 --> 00:54:09.913
STOP THE BENEFITS BECAUSE

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.114
THEY'RE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT.

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:11.915
YOU KNOW THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IT

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:13.683
BUT- I MEAN IF SOMEBODY APPLIES

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.751
REPORT POINT FIVE MILLION

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.319
DOLLARS IN BENEFITS YOU WOULD

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.487
THINK THAT WOULD SET OFF JUST A

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.522
LITTLE BIT OF AN ALARM. BEFORE

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:20.657
THEY WERE ABLE TO WITHDRAW TWO

00:54:20.724 --> 00:54:22.292
POINT EIGHT THREE TWO MILLION

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:25.562
GOOD GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK.

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.063
IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. WHAT

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.965
HAS HAPPENED IS RATHER THAN

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:31.368
ONE. PERSON APPLYING FOR FOUR

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.269
POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN.

00:54:33.336 --> 00:54:34.738
BENEFITS WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:37.540
SET OFF ALARMS IMMEDIATELY. ALL

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.843
HAVE STOLEN IDENTITIES FROM THE

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:42.879
WEB. HAVE CREATED BACKSTORIES

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:45.081
TO THEM AND HAVE APPLIED

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:47.717
MULTIPLE TIMES. THAT'S WHAT HAS

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.719
BEEN HAPPENING THAT WAS WHAT

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:53.156
WAS HAPPENING NOW NO ONE GETS

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.824
THROUGH WITHOUT GOING TO OUR

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:57.894
FRAGILE TRUCE SO THAT IS NOT

00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:00.697
LIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN. AND WE

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:03.533
ARE CONTROL WE ARE MONITORING.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:07.937
ANY ADDRESS IN WHICH MORE THAN

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:11.107
SEVEN PEOPLE ARE APPLYING AND I

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.976
BRING THAT UP BECAUSE WE ALSO

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.045
HAVE ISSUES WITH SOMETIMES

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:16.946
HOMELESS PEOPLE USING THE

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:20.583
SHELTERS ADDRESS SO WE

ON- CASES ADD CASES L. AND IT

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.393
STARTED TO MAKE A VERY BIG

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.628
DIFFERENCE WHEN A PARTICULAR

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:55.897
PERSON WAS ASSIGNED EVEN IF IT

THE FEW HOURS THAT THEY HAVE

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.303
WITH THIS LADY IS ON BECAUSE

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:04.139
THEY ACTUALLY SOLVE THE CASES

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:06.174
WHICH THEY ARE MOSTLY UNABLE TO

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.743
DO THEMSELVES IF THEY YOU KNOW

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:09.377
JUST TRY DIRECTLY WITH THE D.

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.646

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.883
SUCCESSFUL THE ISSUE THAT

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:15.817
THAT'S NOT THE CORE ISSUE

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.819
THOUGH THAT'S NOT THE REAL

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:20.021
PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:22.357
A PROBLEM. THAT IS ALREADY

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.760

OWNBECAUSE- WE DON'T WANT TO

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.635

OF FOR JUMPING INTO THIS AND-

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:49.451
BEING COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:52.687

REALLY UNDER A MAGNIFYING

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:59.661
GLASS- AND YET WE STILL FIND

01:19:59.728 --> 01:20:00.929
OURSELVES YOU FIND YOURSELVES

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:03.298

MORE WORK HAS TO BE DONE ON

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:11.773
THAT BUT THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.342
ME. IF IT'S SOME OF THE

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:15.844
BENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.813
PROJECT- WHAT WHAT IS THE

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:25.520
TIMELINE. YOU SEE ON ON THAT.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:29.291
THE QUESTION WE ARE NOW IN THE

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:32.127
PROCESS OF PUTTING TOGETHER. A

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:37.265
PLAN TO. WORK WITH A VENDOR. TO

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.000
BRING TOGETHER ALL OF THE

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:41.770
INFORMATION THAT THE- I. T.

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:45.240

OUT WITH THE INITIAL. STAR

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.315
SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION AND WE'RE

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:54.783
GOING TO TAKE THE BEST OF THAT

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:57.018
INFORMATION. WE HAVE BEEN

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.154
FOLLOWING MASS WHAT NATIONAL

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:01.423
ASSOCIATION OF WORKFORCE.

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:05.660
AGENCIES AND WE'VE LEARNED FROM

01:21:05.727 --> 01:21:09.231
THE OTHER OF STATE AND SOME OF

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:11.032
THE STATE'S ACTUALLY HAD A NEW

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.033
SYSTEM WHEN THE PANDEMIC

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.070
STARTED AND WE'VE ALL LEARNED

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:15.570
THAT THOSE SYSTEMS WERE

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:17.706
INSUFFICIENT. AND WE'RE GOING

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:20.041
TO RESEARCH ANY NEW SOLUTIONS

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:23.011
THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THE ACT

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:25.580
TIMELINE IS STILL BEING WORKED

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:29.050
ON BUT I EXPECT TO SEE SOME

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:32.687
PROGRESS BAR BEFORE THE FALL.

01:21:32.754 --> 01:21:37.325

NEWER APPROACH WHICH IS THE

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:25.273
AGILE APPROACH IN WHICH PART OF

GRADUALLY. IN ADDITION TO THAT

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.746
RATHER THAN BUILDING NUMBER THE

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:35.917
HE MUST OF- OF THE SYSTEM WE'RE

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.620

LEVEL 125% POP SO CONSIDER

01:48:39.212 --> 01:48:39.646

WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND-

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:08.408
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT-

01:49:08.475 --> 01:49:10.243
DIFFERENT PERCENT PROVISIONS IN

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.044
THE LEGISLATION I WILL POINT

01:49:11.111 --> 01:49:13.313
OUT THAT THAT MINIMUM 50%

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.381
REQUIREMENT IS ACTUALLY

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:16.082
INCLUDED AND STATUTE THAT WAS

01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:18.318
SOMETHING- THAT WAS DISCUSSED

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.719
WHEN THE ORIGINAL PILOTS WERE

LEGISLATURE- THAT LEGISLATION

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:24.791

HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON. THE SAY

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:31.998
THAT ALL THE COURTS ARE MADE

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.868
50% REDUCTION. I MEAN THAT WAS

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:37.203
A REQUIREMENT THAT A MINIMUM OF

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:40.106
50% ARE A MAXIMUM THE

01:49:40.173 --> 01:49:41.875

ITSELF RECOMMENDED A 50%

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:46.279

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:47.814
AMONG ALL OF THE REDUCTIONS

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:51.384
THAT HAVE HAPPENED IS ABOUT 54%

01:49:51.451 --> 01:49:52.752
THERE'S A RANGE AMONG THE

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.554
COURTS SOME COURTS ARE JUST

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:57.190
BELOW 50% OTHER COURTS ARE UP

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:58.959

REDUCTION THAT THEY PROVIDED TO

01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:03.997
CONSUMERS. SO THAT AMOUNT IS

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:05.999
STILL- OPTIONAL AS FAR AS-

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:07.200

ME GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE KIND OF

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:27.787
WALK ME THROUGH WHY WOULD IT A

01:50:27.854 --> 01:50:30.023
JUDICIAL OFFICER NOT RECOMMEND

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:32.826
A REDUCTION OF TO SOMEONE WHO

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:37.530
IS QUALIFIED. SO ABOUT 75% OF

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:40.567
THE- OF OTHER REQUESTS THAT ARE

01:50:40.633 --> 01:50:42.168
MADE ARE APPROVED BY THE

01:50:42.235 --> 01:50:43.636
JUDICIAL OFFICER WE'VE GONE

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:45.171
THROUGH ON COLLECTED DATA ON

01:50:45.238 --> 01:50:46.706
THE REASONS THAT THEY HAVE NOT

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:49.709
BEEN ACCEPTED 75% OF THOSE THAT

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.444
HAVE BEEN REJECTED. WERE

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:54.247
REJECTED FOR REASONS LIKE- THE

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:56.750
PERSON HAS A MISDEMEANOR IN THE

01:50:56.816 --> 01:50:58.251
CITATION MISDEMEANORS ARE NOT

01:50:58.318 --> 01:51:00.453
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM. THE

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:02.956
REQUESTED TO DUPLICATE OF ONE

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:05.792
ALREADY UNDER REVIEW- THEY'VE

01:51:05.859 --> 01:51:07.527
ALREADY SCHEDULED A COURT DATE-

01:51:07.594 --> 01:51:09.295
THEY HAVE A FIX IT TICKET AND

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:10.230
THEY MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED TO

01:51:10.296 --> 01:51:12.532
COME IN AND FIX THE TICKET AND

01:51:12.599 --> 01:51:13.933
HAVE THE FEE WAIVED. THERE ARE

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.969
OTHER INSTANCES WHERE THE

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:17.504
PERSON'S INCOME ELIGIBILITY IS

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:19.339
HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT WOULD BE

01:51:19.406 --> 01:51:20.373
ANOTHER REASON BUT WE ARE

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.841
SEEING ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:26.513
PERCENT- FIVE APPROVAL RATES OF

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:27.080
THE OF THE REQUESTS THAT ARE

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:31.651
MADE. I THINK THAT JUST THE

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:33.286
ISSUE OF WORK WHAT ARE WE

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:36.156
FACING HERE. EIGHT POINT SIX

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:38.158
BILLION DOLLARS IN FINES AND

01:51:38.224 --> 01:51:40.593
FEES REMAIN OUTSTANDING THAT'S

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.629
AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:46.933
MONEY OWED BY INDIVIDUALS- SO

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.369
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS ARE WE

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.471
REALLY IT REMINDS ME OF THE

01:51:51.538 --> 01:51:56.943
OTHER- LAST YEAR IN THE DAM-

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:59.379
SENATOR MITCHELL RAISED AND

01:51:59.446 --> 01:52:01.648
THAT WE RAISED ABOUT FEES JUST

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:04.384
ACCUMULATING. ARE OVER AND OVER

01:52:04.451 --> 01:52:05.685
YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'RE NOT

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.754
COLLECTING THEM SO WHERE DO WE

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:08.755
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:11.458
OTHER THAN IT JUST HANGS OVER

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:13.626
AND CAUSES ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:16.196
PROBLEMS FOR THOSE WHO- SO-

01:52:16.262 --> 01:52:18.565
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS. ARE WE

01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:20.667
REALLY GETTING ANYWHERE WITH

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:23.336
THIS OTHER THAN- OF PLACING

01:52:23.403 --> 01:52:25.939
THAT PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO PAY

01:52:26.005 --> 01:52:27.507
WHEN THEY OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.742
THE ABILITY TO PAY- I DON'T

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:32.879
KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS.

01:52:32.946 --> 01:52:35.882
ABOUT THAT. I WOULD I WOULD

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:38.451
JUST SAY THAT- THE FILM

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:41.287
CATALYST FOR DOING THIS PROGRAM

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:43.723
IS TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:45.525
NEEDS OF LOW INCOME

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.060
CALIFORNIANS WHO OTHERWISE

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:48.194
DON'T HAVE AN ABILITY TO PAY

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.929
AND SO IT REALLY IS A PROACTIVE

01:52:49.996 --> 01:52:52.265
STEP. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

01:52:52.332 --> 01:52:53.700
RELIEF TO PEOPLE AND TO BREAK

01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:54.801
DOWN SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS AS

01:52:54.868 --> 01:52:56.870
I ALREADY MENTIONED RIGHT WHEN

01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:58.538
SOMEONE HAS TO GO INTO COURT

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.039
AND TAKE A DAY OFF OF WORK OR

01:53:00.106 --> 01:53:02.408
GET CHILD CARE- THOSE ARE THE

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:03.510
SORTS OF BURDENS AND THE

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:06.246
OBSTACLES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO-

01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:08.748
TRYING TO ALLEVIATE WITH THE

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:11.017
ADOPTION OF THIS PROGRAM. YEAH

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:12.218
PLUS THE FACT PEOPLE JUST DON'T

01:53:12.285 --> 01:53:15.855
HAVE THE MONEY. YES- THANK YOU

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:20.393

THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

01:53:32.772 --> 01:53:36.709
SURE SO- AS I MENTIONED-

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:39.078
PREVIOUSLY I CO LED THE

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.246
DECOMPOSITION PROBABLY CONNECT

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.282
THE STAKING LAWCENTER AND

01:53:42.348 --> 01:53:44.417
PRIMARILY- WHAT WE DID IN THAT

01:53:44.484 --> 01:53:47.086
CLINIC WAS ADVOCATE FOR FOLKS

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.354
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR

01:53:48.421 --> 01:53:52.659
COURT- AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS

01:53:52.725 --> 01:53:55.528
THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN KIND OF-

01:53:55.595 --> 01:53:58.198
MAKE MORE- FACING SORT OF LIKE

01:53:58.264 --> 01:53:59.933
THE INJUSTICE THAT ALREADY

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:00.934
HAPPENS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.368
SEE ON THE GROUND SO FOR

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:05.805
EXAMPLE- IF THE AVERAGE- IF

01:54:05.872 --> 01:54:07.941
THERE'S- THAT MUCH LEEWAY

01:54:08.007 --> 01:54:10.243
BETWEEN THE- REDUCTIONS THAT

01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:11.377
PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETWEEN

01:54:11.444 --> 01:54:12.312
FIFTY AND SEVENTY EIGHT

01:54:12.378 --> 01:54:13.413
PERCENT. AND THAT MEANS

01:54:13.479 --> 01:54:14.414
DEPENDING UPON WHERE YOU'RE

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.549
GETTING YOUR TICKET FOR EXAMPLE

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.521
PLACING IN ANOTHER PLACE IN

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.089
ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:25.391
IT TOOK US YEARS TO SORT OF

01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:27.327
PUSH THE COURT AWAY FROM USING

01:54:27.393 --> 01:54:29.596
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE- TO

01:54:29.662 --> 01:54:30.763
USE IN THE HOOD STANDARD IN

01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:33.700
FROM USING THE LOWEST PORTION

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:10.296
IS A- INFORMATIONAL ITEM ONLY

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:12.865
SO NO ACTION IS NEEDED. SURE

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:14.500

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:16.002
I APOLOGIZE SO I AM ACTUALLY

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:17.036
THIS IS AN INTERESTING

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:19.872
DISCUSSION SO- DID NOT HAVE A

01:56:19.939 --> 01:56:21.941
QUESTION TO- COULD GET

01:56:22.008 --> 01:56:23.242
INTERESTING- AND I APPRECIATE

OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ON

FINE SPRAY THEM INTO THAT THAT-

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:33.386
THAT WAS NEVER THE INTENT. AND

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:35.321
THE INTENT OF FINANCES TO

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:35.788
CREATE A DETERRENT FOR

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:38.057
MISBEHAVIOR. WE SHOULD PROBABLY

01:56:38.124 --> 01:56:39.559
WHAT'S THE LOWEST FINE WE COULD

01:56:39.625 --> 01:56:41.361
HAVE TO CREATE THE DETERRENT.

01:56:41.427 --> 01:56:43.830
AND MY QUESTION FOR. ANYBODY

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:44.997
HERE IS HAVE WE GIVEN ANY

01:56:45.064 --> 01:56:46.833
THOUGHT. TO LOOKING AT THIS IN

01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:48.634
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION MAYBE

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:49.635
INSTEAD OF REDUCING FINES

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:51.471
DOWNWARD. WITH RESPECT TO

01:56:51.537 --> 01:56:52.605
ABILITY TO PAY MAYBE WE SHOULD

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.507
JUST FIND UPWARD YOU KNOW START

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:56.442
AT THE AT THE LOWEST NUMBER IS

01:56:56.509 --> 01:56:56.909
A DO IN PLACES LIKE

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.711
SCANDINAVIA- AND DO IT

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:00.179
PROGRESSIVELY BASED ON YOUR

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:01.748
ABILITY TO PAY BUT IN THE OTHER

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:03.549
DIRECTION. I SAW THAT POOR

01:57:03.616 --> 01:57:04.717
PEOPLE ARE BEING PENALIZED SO

01:57:04.784 --> 01:57:08.221
HAVE HAS THAT EVER BEEN PART OF

01:57:08.287 --> 01:57:09.822
THE DISCUSSION. SO IT SURE WHAT

01:57:09.889 --> 01:57:12.225
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- IS- IS A

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:15.628
DAY FIND MODEL- TO MY KNOWLEDGE

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:17.964
THAT HASN'T. BEEN CAN I SEE A

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:19.966
SEAMLESSLY WITH THEIR HAND UP

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:21.100
THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD SAY

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:24.937
IS THAT- WHILE THAT. COULD WORK

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:26.139
IN BE MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THE

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.074
CURRENT SORT OF REGRESSIVE

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:32.445
TAXATION- THAT EXIST. FHWA WE

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.214
UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT I'M

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:37.817
SPEAKING TO SO- AT THE BACK OF

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.618
THE ROLL CALL THE SCENE YOU

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:39.986
KNOW DID A SERIES OF REPORTS

01:57:40.052 --> 01:57:41.454
THERE'S INTERACTIVE MAPS THAT

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:43.523
SHOW ESSENTIALLY YOU CAN MAP-

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:45.925
BLACK BROWN AND- LOW INCOME

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:46.893
COMMUNITIES AND YOU CAN SORT OF

01:57:46.959 --> 01:57:48.394
DETERMINE. WHERE THE HIGHEST

01:57:48.461 --> 01:57:49.896
DRIVER'S LICENSE SUSPENSIONS

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:51.297
ARE NO DON'T GET ME WRONG I

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:52.432
APPRECIATE THAT POINT I'M

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.800
SAYING YOU KNOW LET'S LEAVE IT

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:54.700
LEAVE LEAVING THAT ASIDE FOR A

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.235
MOMENT. YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:57:56.302 --> 01:57:57.403
AMAZING PHILOSOPHICAL

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:58.771
DISCUSSION WE HAD HERE ABOUT

01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:00.606
YOU KNOW IS FOR THE PURPOSE-

01:58:00.673 --> 01:58:03.943
AND ROLL AND USE OF PENALTIES-

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:05.645
AND IT IT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:06.412
THEY WERE LOOKING IN THE WRONG

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:07.313
DIRECTION MAYBE MAYBE HIGH

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.948
INCOME PEOPLE SHOULD VERY. MUCH

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:10.283
MORE RIGHTS TO THEIR THEY'VE

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:11.751
THE PROPORTIONALLY THE SAME.

01:58:11.818 --> 01:58:12.919
DISINCENTIVE TO DO CERTAIN

01:58:12.985 --> 01:58:15.321
THINGS ARE DETERMINES. WHERE

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:19.792
WORKING PEOPLE SHOULD PAY LESS.

01:58:19.859 --> 01:58:20.426
MAYBE THAT SHOULD BE THAT THERE

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:20.927
SHOULD BE THE BASELINE.

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:21.794
YESTERDAY FOR. MODEL WITH THE-

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.329
BE INTEREST TO HAVE A- OF.

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:29.202
GREAT THANK YOU- MISLI. I'M SO

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:31.070
CENTER NEWMAN YOU MIGHT FIND A

01:58:31.137 --> 01:58:32.138
REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT A COUPLE

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:36.542
YEARS INTERESTING IT WAS FINE-

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:37.109
IT WAS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:39.445
STATE'S. BROADER SYSTEM AND SO

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:40.546
ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:58:40.613 --> 01:58:42.515
WE HAD IN THERE WAS THAT WE DID

01:58:42.582 --> 01:58:44.450
RECOMMEND AN EVALUATION OF THE

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:45.885
STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:47.053
CRIMINAL POINTED THE SYSTEM

01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:48.588
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OUR WORK.

01:58:48.654 --> 01:58:51.991
WE NOTED THAT WHERE WE ARE NOW

01:58:52.058 --> 01:58:54.460
INVOLVED FROM BASICALLY LOTS

01:58:54.527 --> 01:58:55.728
AND LOTS OF STATUTES BEING

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:57.663
PASSED OVER NUMEROUS YEARS SORT

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:58.865
OF BEING LAYERED ON TOP OF ONE

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.267
ANOTHER AND SORT OF OVER TIME

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:02.768
KIND OF THE PURPOSE AND KIND OF

01:59:02.835 --> 01:59:04.337
WHAT WERE THE GOALS SORT OF GOT

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:05.938
LOST AND SO I'VE HEARD OF THAT

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:07.874
REEVALUATION. WE SAID THAT

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.575
THERE WERE FOUR KEY QUESTIONS

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:10.977
AND I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:12.044
IS THE FIRST AFTER THE FIRST

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:13.212
AND SECOND QUESTION ARE IN LINE

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:14.514
WITH WHAT WE BROUGHT UP. SO

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.182
FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT SHOULD

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:18.117
BE THE GOALS OF THE SYSTEM AND

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.952
SO WE LAID OUT THIS CONCEPT OF

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:22.054
DETERRENCE VERSUS PROPORTIONAL

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.256
PUNISHMENT VERSES THE

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.491
MITIGATION OF CRIME THEY'RE NOT

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:27.293
NECESSARILY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.561
FROM ONE ANOTHER BUT DEPENDING

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:30.496
ON WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE YOU KIND

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:31.797
OF APPROACH HOW YOU SET THE

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:33.833
LEVELS. ETCETERA AND IN A

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.334
DIFFERENT WAY WHAT SECOND

01:59:35.401 --> 01:59:40.673
QUESTION ALSO TIES. TO YOUR

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.307
COMMENTS IN TERMS OF. WE CALLED

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:43.142
IT THE BILL TO PAY IMPORT. AND

01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:44.877
WE BASICALLY IN KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:59:44.944 --> 01:59:46.412
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO

01:59:46.479 --> 01:59:48.481
THINK ABOUT. AN INDIVIDUAL'S

01:59:48.548 --> 01:59:50.049
ABILITY TO PAY ONE OF THE

01:59:50.116 --> 01:59:51.651
OPTIONS THAT WE RAISED WHAT IS

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:52.952
THE DEFINED SYSTEM IN TERMS OF

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.820
CALCULATING IT BASED ON. ON

01:59:54.887 --> 01:59:56.622
THAT BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:58.157
DIFFERENT WAYS FOR YOU TO

01:59:58.224 --> 01:59:59.725
ADDRESS PAYMENTS SO THAT. THIS

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:01.360
IS RAISING THE ISSUE ABOUT

02:00:01.427 --> 02:00:04.297
COMMUNITY SERVICE ETCETERA AND

02:00:04.363 --> 02:00:05.264
JUST TO ROUND IT OFF OF THE

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:07.266
THIRD QUESTION IT WHAT IS AND

02:00:07.333 --> 02:00:07.800
WHAT SHOULD BE THE

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:09.835
CONSEQUENCES. IF AN INDIVIDUAL

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:12.371
DOESN'T PAY AND THE FOURTH WAS

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:13.472
IT SHOULD FINES AND FEES BE

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:15.207
ADJUSTED. AND SO THAT WAS YOU

02:00:15.274 --> 02:00:16.075
KNOW SHOULD THEY AUTOMATICALLY

02:00:16.142 --> 02:00:17.577
BE ADJUSTED IT YOU KNOW SHOULD

02:00:17.643 --> 02:00:18.611
THERE BE A TIME HERE AND WHERE

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:20.146
BY WHICH LEGISLATURE ROUTINELY

02:00:20.212 --> 02:00:23.916
COMES BACK AND EVALUATES THEM

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:25.117
ETCETERA. MY MORE DETAIL OR

MORE COME. WITH YOU IF YOU'RE-

AND I. IT WOULD BE WEIRD AT

02:00:28.588 --> 02:00:29.455
THIS POINT I SAID I WASN'T

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:31.324
INTERESTED BUT I ACTUALLY AM SO

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.858
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU

02:00:32.925 --> 02:00:34.160
COULD FOR THAT TO ME I I'D BE

02:00:34.226 --> 02:00:37.029

HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE

DETENTION CAN OFTEN ONLY BE

02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:39.097
ALLEVIATED IN THE MOMENTS OF

OUTCOMES. WHICH IS IMPORTANT

02:20:49.674 --> 02:20:50.809
BECAUSE NEARLY EVERYONE

02:20:50.875 --> 02:20:52.243
CURRENTLY INCARCERATED IN THE

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:54.245
STATE WILL BE RELEASED AT SOME

02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:57.115
POINT. THE NEED FOR ACCESSIBLE

02:20:57.182 --> 02:20:58.817
REMOTE COMMUNICATION HAS ONLY

02:20:58.883 --> 02:21:00.418
BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE

02:21:00.485 --> 02:21:02.120

THE COMMUNITY ON THE OUTSIDE

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:19.838
SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A PUBLIC

02:21:19.904 --> 02:21:22.607
UTILITY AND IT IS WORTHY OF THE

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:24.542
STATE'S INVESTMENT. LOVED ONES

02:21:24.609 --> 02:21:26.377

KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH

EXCLUSIVELY NOT INCARCERATED

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:33.151
PEOPLE THEMSELVES. THIS IS TRUE

02:21:33.218 --> 02:21:34.319

INTO SEE IN THE STATE PRISON

02:27:56.734 --> 02:27:58.769
SYSTEM AND THAT IS DETERMINED

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:00.037
BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON

02:28:00.104 --> 02:28:02.340
SOMEBODY'S BOOKS THEY CALL IT

02:28:02.406 --> 02:28:04.242
THEIR ACCOUNT WHICH IS PUT

02:28:04.308 --> 02:28:05.309
THERE BY FAMILY MEMBERS

02:28:05.376 --> 02:28:08.045
GENERALLY- PEOPLE DO GET PAID

02:28:08.112 --> 02:28:09.447
SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY IF

02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:11.249
THEY'RE WORKING IN THE PRISONS

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:12.350
BUT GENERALLY THE AMOUNTS OF

02:28:12.416 --> 02:28:14.652
MONEY ON THEIR ACCOUNTS ARE PUT

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:16.621
THERE BY FAMILY MEMBERS. OKAY

02:28:16.687 --> 02:28:20.358
YEAH RIGHT NOW I'M SURE PHONY

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:21.892
FOUR FIVE EIGHT I JUST THINK.

02:28:21.959 --> 02:28:24.862
IT MIGHT BE OUTSIDE OF FROM AN

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:26.130
OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE A

02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:27.131
DISTINCTION WITHOUT A

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:31.469
DIFFERENCE- IS THE IDEA THAT.

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:34.372
ONE INMATE HAS FAMILY THAT'S

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:35.906
GENEROUS AND PUTTING MONEY UP

02:28:35.973 --> 02:28:37.608
FOR THEM AND ANOTHER INMATE

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:41.345
DOESN'T- MAYBE JUST NEEDS TO BE

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:43.080
DISREGARDED IN THIS CONTEXT IN

02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.849
TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS CAUSES

02:28:44.915 --> 02:28:47.585
I MEAN THE IDEA WOULD BE.

02:28:47.652 --> 02:28:48.119
ALLOWING COMMUNICATIONS TO

02:28:48.185 --> 02:28:51.822
OCCUR. I WOULD THINK FAIRLY-

02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:53.557
EQUITABLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:56.127
IRRESPECTIVE OF. WHO HAS A RICH

02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:58.362
UNCLE OR NOT FROM THIS THAT'S

02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:59.964
OR FOR HOW LONG THAT MAY BE THE

02:29:00.031 --> 02:29:01.499
CASE- BUT ANYWAY THAT'S JUST

02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:03.968
MY- PERSONAL OPINION NO I AGREE

02:29:04.035 --> 02:29:06.804
ESPECIALLY- AS WE HEAR ABOUT

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:08.406
HOW THIS HAS A BIG IMPACT ON

02:29:08.472 --> 02:29:10.141
MENTAL HEALTH THIS HAS AN

02:29:10.207 --> 02:29:12.743
IMPACT WITH REENTRY SUCCESS

02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:14.011
MEAN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:17.682
SORT OF LOOKING FOR- YOU KNOW

02:29:17.748 --> 02:29:19.784
TO CHANGE IN THE IN THE SYSTEM.

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:22.253
THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.921
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T

02:29:23.988 --> 02:29:26.290
THINK OF PHONE CALLS AND VIDEOS

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:28.893
IN CONNECTION WITH FAMILY OF

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.628
WOULD BE SO IMPORTANT TO THE TO

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:32.396
THE FUTURE OF THOSE-

02:29:32.463 --> 02:29:34.565
INDIVIDUALS AND NEWMAN THEY

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:36.267
JUST ADD IMAGE OF MY UNDERSTAND

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:38.002

STATE APPOINTED ATTORNEY

02:33:19.690 --> 02:33:21.225

02:33:23.427 --> 02:33:25.329
AT THE TIME THE ATTORNEY WASN'T

ATTENTION HURDLES TO BEING

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.208
FOUND SUITABLE AND THINGS I

02:33:38.275 --> 02:33:39.109
COULD BETTER WORK ON TO PREPARE

02:33:39.176 --> 02:33:41.345
MYSELF. INSTEAD WE USED OUR

02:33:41.412 --> 02:33:42.746
FIRST MEETING FOR ME TO TELL

02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:44.748

THE PAROLE PROCESS. ABOUT A

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.888
MONTH LATER I RECEIVED AN

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:53.023
APPOINTMENT FOR A COMPREHENSIVE

02:33:53.090 --> 02:33:55.759

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:57.294
A PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

CONDUCTED BY FORENSIC

02:33:58.629 --> 02:34:00.264
PSYCHOLOGIST TO DETERMINE AN

02:34:00.331 --> 02:34:02.199
INDIVIDUAL'S RISK FOR FUTURE

CRIMINAL HISTORY INSIGHT INTO

02:34:09.039 --> 02:34:10.307
WHY I COMMITTED MY COMMITMENT

02:34:10.374 --> 02:34:12.376
OFFENSE WE ABILITY OF WORK I'VE

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:14.011
DONE SINCE COMING TO PRISON AS

02:34:14.078 --> 02:34:15.879
WELL AS DISCIPLINARY HISTORY

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:18.182
AND POST RELEASE PLANS. I'D

02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.483
LATER FIND OUT THAT THESE WERE

02:34:19.550 --> 02:34:21.051
ALL TOPICS THAT WILL BE COVERED

02:34:21.118 --> 02:34:22.519
IN EVEN MORE DEPTH THAT MY

02:34:22.586 --> 02:34:24.355
PAROLE HEARING. AND THE ANSWERS

02:34:24.421 --> 02:34:25.422
ARE GIVEN TO THE FORENSIC

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:27.791
PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE INTEGRAL

02:34:27.858 --> 02:34:28.792
PART OF THE PREPARATION OF

02:34:28.859 --> 02:34:30.260
PAROLE COMMISSIONERS WERE GOING

02:34:30.327 --> 02:34:32.529
TO ASSESS MY SUITABILITY FOR

02:34:32.596 --> 02:34:35.232
RELEASE. I'VE BEEN DILIGENTLY

02:34:35.299 --> 02:34:36.433
DOING MY OWN REHABILITATIVE

02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.168
WORK FOR FIFTEEN YEARS LEADING

02:34:38.235 --> 02:34:39.903
UP TO THIS FINAL SIX MONTHS.

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:40.838
BUT WHILE GOING THROUGH THIS

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:42.339
PROCESS I LEARNED THAT THERE'S

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:44.375
A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:46.343
INTERNALIZING THE SKILLS I NEED

02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:48.445
TO SAFELY REENTER SOCIETY. AND

02:34:48.512 --> 02:34:50.814
EXPRESSING THAT INSIGHT REMORSE

02:34:50.881 --> 02:34:52.883
IN PREPARATION TO OTHERS. MY

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:53.817
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:55.919
PROCESS AND WHAT WAS EXPECTED

02:34:55.986 --> 02:34:57.788
OF ME LARGELY LEFT ME AT RISK

02:34:57.855 --> 02:34:58.689
OF FAILING TO BE FOUND

02:34:58.756 --> 02:35:00.357
SUITABLE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:02.292
WORKING TO REHABILITATE MYSELF

02:35:02.359 --> 02:35:04.528
FOR OVER A DECADE AND A HALF.

02:35:04.595 --> 02:35:06.030
SO WHEN I SAW EARLIER THIS YEAR

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:08.499
THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY. ONLY

02:35:08.565 --> 02:35:10.000
ELEVEN POINT 5% OF PEOPLE WERE

02:35:10.067 --> 02:35:11.368
FOUND SUITABLE FOR RELEASE AT

02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:13.570
THEIR INITIAL HEARING. I WASN'T

02:35:13.637 --> 02:35:15.739
SURPRISED. IN FAR TOO MANY

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.107
CASES THE BARRIER TO BEING

02:35:17.174 --> 02:35:19.009
FOUND SUITABLE ISN'T THE WORK A

02:35:19.076 --> 02:35:21.045
PERSON IS DONE. INSTEAD IT'S A

02:35:21.111 --> 02:35:23.480
LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE

02:35:23.547 --> 02:35:24.114
PROCESS AND WHAT IS EXPECTED OF

02:35:24.181 --> 02:35:26.283

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:27.985

EXHAUSTIVE AND RIGOROUS

02:35:31.655 --> 02:35:33.657
EXAMINATION THAT CULMINATES IN

02:35:33.724 --> 02:35:35.559
A PAROLE BOARD HEARING. THEY

02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:36.660
WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING AN

02:35:36.727 --> 02:35:38.629
ATTORNEY'S GUIDANCE THROUGH

02:35:38.696 --> 02:35:40.397
EVERY STAGE OF THE PROCESS.

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:41.498
GRANTING INCARCERATED PEOPLE

A. TOPICS THE SEAT THE FORENSIC

02:35:51.075 --> 02:35:53.177
PSYCHOLOGIST WILL INTERROGATE.

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:54.511

PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THE WORK

02:36:03.053 --> 02:36:04.488
LACK KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROCESS.

02:36:04.555 --> 02:36:05.456
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST

02:39:55.052 --> 02:39:56.720
HAVING ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY IN

02:39:56.787 --> 02:39:58.355
ORDER TO WALK THEM THROUGH THE

02:39:58.422 --> 02:40:01.758

02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:02.793
DIRECTOR SEES THAT HAVE BEEN IN

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:04.861
PLACE. TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND

02:40:04.928 --> 02:40:06.763
WHAT'S EXPECTED OF THEM I THINK

02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:10.067
WE HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON EVEN

02:40:10.133 --> 02:40:12.502
IF AN ADDITIONAL- FIFTY PEOPLE

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:14.404
PER YEAR WERE FOUND SUITABLE AS

02:40:14.471 --> 02:40:16.306
A RESULT OF THIS. THAT WOULD

02:40:16.373 --> 02:40:18.709
SAVE THE STATE. OWNED I THINK

02:40:18.775 --> 02:40:20.143
EVERY PERSON RIGHT NOW COST THE

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:22.145

02:40:27.684 --> 02:40:33.991
IMPACT. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY

02:40:34.057 --> 02:40:36.593
SOMETIMES IT'S A SOME PEOPLE

02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:38.729
ARE MORE FOCUSED ON THE

02:40:38.795 --> 02:40:40.731
DOLLARS- AND I THINK THAT'S

02:40:40.797 --> 02:40:43.433
VERY IMPORTANT TO. TO INCLUDE

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:44.701

02:40:44.768 --> 02:40:47.204
THE WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON THOSE

02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:54.111

03:01:21.203 --> 03:01:22.972
AND THAT C. D. A. DOES NOT

03:01:23.038 --> 03:01:24.607
CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT

03:01:24.673 --> 03:01:26.642
RESOURCES TO REPAY THIS AMOUNT.

03:01:26.709 --> 03:01:29.612
I AM A I DON'T QUITE GET. THEY

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:33.716
GOT THE MONEY. BUT THEY DIDN'T

03:01:33.782 --> 03:01:37.753
OF ITS SOMEHOW MISSING I DON'T

03:01:37.820 --> 03:01:40.556
KNOW WHAT HOW TO. I DON'T HEAR

03:01:40.623 --> 03:01:42.992
A CLEAR EXPLANATION ABOUT THE

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:44.660
TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS

03:01:44.727 --> 03:01:46.061
AND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

03:01:46.128 --> 03:01:49.398
UP FOR IT BY. FUTURE FUNDS THAT

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:51.467
THEY GET BUT WHAT. WHAT

03:01:51.533 --> 03:01:53.235
HAPPENED TO THIS TWO POINT NINE

03:01:53.302 --> 03:01:58.574
MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE BEST

03:01:58.641 --> 03:02:00.409
AND EASY ANSWER MADAM CHAIRS

03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:04.346
QUESTION WOULD BE CA- IN

03:02:04.413 --> 03:02:06.949
LOOKING AT THE AUDIT- THE

03:02:07.016 --> 03:02:08.717
AUDITOR WAS THE ONE THAT

03:02:08.784 --> 03:02:09.885
IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS

03:02:09.952 --> 03:02:11.687
APPROXIMATELY I WAS LOOKING AT

03:02:11.754 --> 03:02:13.022
THE AVAILABLE PLANS THAT THAT

03:02:13.088 --> 03:02:14.323
EXISTED AT THAT TIME IN TERMS

03:02:14.390 --> 03:02:17.426
OF CASH AND ACT AND ASSETS. AND

03:02:17.493 --> 03:02:19.028
BASICALLY SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T

03:02:19.094 --> 03:02:19.962
THINK THAT CA HAD THE

03:02:20.029 --> 03:02:21.563
HURRICANES OF THAT TIME THERE

03:02:21.630 --> 03:02:22.665
COULD BE A COUPLE REASONS FOR

03:02:22.731 --> 03:02:24.300
THIS- SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT

03:02:24.366 --> 03:02:26.602
COMES INTO CA CAN FLUCTUATE

03:02:26.669 --> 03:02:27.536
FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WHEN WE'RE

03:02:27.603 --> 03:02:28.837
TALKING ABOUT SOURCES OF STATE

03:02:28.904 --> 03:02:31.507
FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE- THE GRANT

03:02:31.573 --> 03:02:32.441
FUNDS LITIGATION PROCEEDS

03:02:32.508 --> 03:02:34.510
ETCETERA. CAN VARY FROM YEAR TO

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:37.112
YEAR AND SO ORGANIZATIONS

03:02:37.179 --> 03:02:39.548
OUTSIDE OF CDA THINK ABOUT YOUR

03:02:39.615 --> 03:02:40.683
STATE DEPARTMENT ETCETERA THE

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:41.517
SENATE YOU'RE MISSING SOME OF

03:02:41.583 --> 03:02:43.419
THOSE DOLLARS WILL MANAGE

03:02:43.485 --> 03:02:45.120
ACCORDINGLY RIGHT NOW ALL

03:02:45.187 --> 03:02:47.556
MANAGED TO THAT FLUCTUATION SO

03:02:47.623 --> 03:02:49.758
THAT'S ONE ISSUE- THEY HAVE A

03:02:49.825 --> 03:02:51.894
CERTAIN LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE I

03:02:51.960 --> 03:02:53.162
DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT DOES

03:02:53.228 --> 03:02:54.330
EXPENDITURES ARE ONGOING OR

03:02:54.396 --> 03:02:55.798
TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND SO THAT

03:02:55.864 --> 03:02:58.567
COULD LEAD. TO SOME OF- THAT

03:02:58.634 --> 03:03:00.235
FISCAL ISSUE THERE THE FINAL

03:03:00.302 --> 03:03:01.036
THING THAT I WOULD JUST

03:03:01.103 --> 03:03:02.471
HIGHLIGHT IN TERMS OF KIND OF

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:06.842
THE REPAYMENTS IS- THAT CDA

03:03:06.909 --> 03:03:10.412
DOES HAVE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF

03:03:10.479 --> 03:03:12.348
MAKING MONEY IS AVAILABLE AND

03:03:12.414 --> 03:03:14.283
SO SOME OPTIONS INCLUDE CUTTING

03:03:14.350 --> 03:03:15.784
THEIR EXPENDITURES IN TERMS

03:03:15.851 --> 03:03:16.518
ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING

03:03:16.585 --> 03:03:18.554
ELSEWHERE. WE WOULD ALSO SAY

03:03:18.620 --> 03:03:19.822
THAT- FOR LEGISLATORS

03:03:19.888 --> 03:03:22.024
CONSIDERATION THAT CDA COULD

03:03:22.091 --> 03:03:23.726
ALSO LOOK AT THEIR REVENUE

03:03:23.792 --> 03:03:25.127
GENERATION SOURCE AND SO ONE OF

03:03:25.194 --> 03:03:25.994
THEIR SOURCES OF REVENUE FOR

03:03:26.061 --> 03:03:27.396
EXAMPLE IS MEMBERSHIP DUES I

03:03:27.463 --> 03:03:29.064
DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS-

03:03:29.131 --> 03:03:31.667
BUT THOSE DOLLARS COULD ALSO BE

03:03:31.734 --> 03:03:33.202
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY INCREASED TO

03:03:33.268 --> 03:03:34.002
GENERATE REVENUE IF THE

03:03:34.069 --> 03:03:36.305
LEGISLATURE- AND CDA FOR

03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:37.306
EXAMPLE WERE INTERESTED IN

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:45.013
HAVING THOSE. DOLLARS REPAID

03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:46.281
FASTER. I NOTICED THAT YOU TERM

03:03:46.348 --> 03:03:48.450
BAR MONIES REPAY. BORROWED MY-

03:03:48.517 --> 03:03:51.387
I'M- AGAIN I'M JUST TRYING TO

03:03:51.453 --> 03:03:53.522
FIGURE OUT DID THIS MONEY

03:03:53.589 --> 03:03:55.724
DISAPPEARS SO IS A MINOR AREAS

03:03:55.791 --> 03:03:57.126
OR IS IT JUST MOVED AROUND

03:03:57.192 --> 03:03:58.594
SOMEWHERE ELSE NINE ISSUES THEY

03:03:58.660 --> 03:03:59.795
THEY SPENT RESTRICTED MONIES

03:03:59.862 --> 03:04:01.630
AND OTHER PURPOSES IS THAT

03:04:01.697 --> 03:04:03.132
RIGHT MOSTLY TO ENSURE THAT

03:04:03.198 --> 03:04:04.500
MONEY'S GONE IT WAS SUSPENDED

03:04:04.566 --> 03:04:05.501
FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THE

03:04:05.567 --> 03:04:06.869
THAN THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE

03:04:06.935 --> 03:04:09.104
RESTRICTIONS. AND SO BUT THEY

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:10.606
CLEARLY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS AT

03:04:10.672 --> 03:04:12.508
THE MOMENT TO REIMBURSE THOSE

03:04:12.574 --> 03:04:15.911
FUNDS TO THE APPROPRIATE COUNTY

03:04:15.978 --> 03:04:20.249
SAID CORRECT. AS A THINKING

03:04:20.315 --> 03:04:21.450
ABOUT SO WHEN YOU'RE CANCELING

03:04:21.517 --> 03:04:22.551
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE STATE

03:04:22.618 --> 03:04:24.119
BUDGET RIGHT THERE IS THE

03:04:24.186 --> 03:04:26.855
GENERAL FUND WHICH IS. WHICH IS

03:04:26.922 --> 03:04:28.590
SORT OF UNREST. AND TO SEE HAS

03:04:28.657 --> 03:04:31.560
AN UNREST GENERAL AS WELL. THIS

03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:32.628
LEGISLATURE ALSO CONSIDER THE

03:04:32.694 --> 03:04:34.096
WHOLE RANGE OF SPECIAL AND

03:04:34.163 --> 03:04:36.231
DOLLARS FROM THERE AND DOLLARS

03:04:36.298 --> 03:04:37.299
FROM SPECIAL FUNDS GENERALLY

03:04:37.366 --> 03:04:38.534
HAVE SOME DEGREE OF

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:39.868
RESTRICTIONS SOME BIGGER AND

03:04:39.935 --> 03:04:42.805
SOME LAST. AND SO FOREST ON THE

03:04:42.871 --> 03:04:44.106
CDA SIDE FOR THESE

03:04:44.173 --> 03:04:45.874
ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS OR STATE

03:04:45.941 --> 03:04:47.242
FUNDING SOURCES OR OTHER

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:48.977
FUNDING SOURCES IF THEY GET

03:04:49.044 --> 03:04:49.478
THEM FOR VERY PARTICULAR

03:04:49.545 --> 03:04:51.180
PURPOSES THEY SHOULD BE GOING

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:53.048
INTO THESE. HEALTH PLANS. AND

03:04:53.115 --> 03:04:55.584
SO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IS

03:04:55.651 --> 03:04:56.351
THAT THE AUDIT FOUND THAT

03:04:56.418 --> 03:04:59.087
DOLLARS WERE BORROW. FROM THE

03:04:59.154 --> 03:05:01.390
B. IS RESTRICTED. FROM THE

03:05:01.457 --> 03:05:02.024
LEGISLATURE VIEWPOINT YOU WOULD

03:05:02.090 --> 03:05:03.926
THINK OF THEM AS SPECIAL PLANS

03:05:03.992 --> 03:05:06.328
AND USING THEM FOR ON. GENERAL

03:05:06.395 --> 03:05:08.564
FUND PURPOSES. I DON'T KNOW

03:05:08.630 --> 03:05:11.700
THAT EXAM HOW- BUT- THAT

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:12.267
PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:05:12.334 --> 03:05:19.575
CLARITY. YOUR YES CENTER

03:05:19.641 --> 03:05:21.977
KICKING HIS FIFTH CAN I JUST

03:05:22.044 --> 03:05:24.480
ASK YOU FINISH THE BOOK BY THE

03:05:24.546 --> 03:05:29.084
SAME UNGREASED. PURPOSE SUCH AS-

03:05:29.151 --> 03:05:32.788
WHAT I MEAN IF I AM AS MICHAEL

03:05:32.855 --> 03:05:34.456
BEST QUESTION OF BECOME A

03:05:34.523 --> 03:05:36.859
SENIOR. I THINK WE HONOR THE

03:05:36.925 --> 03:05:38.327
BETWEEN GENERAL FUND TO

03:05:38.393 --> 03:05:39.428
RESTRICT FRIENDS SO FOR THAT

03:05:39.495 --> 03:05:44.399
THE REALLY SMALL. LAKE WHAT THE

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:46.869
HECK WAS MONEY USED. WE

03:05:46.935 --> 03:05:48.170
UNDERSTAND FROM THE TO THAT

03:05:48.237 --> 03:05:49.705
THEY WERE OF OUR- THE FUNDS

03:05:49.771 --> 03:05:50.939
THAT WERE YOU FOR SOME ELSE BUT

03:05:51.006 --> 03:05:52.040
I THINK WE HEARD WHAT THE

03:05:52.107 --> 03:05:54.476
SOMETHING ELSE WAS. AND I THINK

03:05:54.543 --> 03:05:56.278
THAT THERE'S A SORT OF A PUBLIC

03:05:56.345 --> 03:05:58.680
POLICY INTEREST IN IN UNDER.

03:05:58.747 --> 03:06:00.215
WAS IT USED FOR CONTINUE THAT.

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:03.485
FOR THE BAR FOR IT USED- FIELD

03:06:03.552 --> 03:06:08.357
TRIPS. YOU KNOW. DISNEYLAND AYE

03:06:08.423 --> 03:06:11.159
AYE WE DON'T WHAT IT WAS FOR.

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:13.428
THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A FAIR

03:06:13.495 --> 03:06:16.064
QUESTION AND SO- WHEN WE

03:06:16.131 --> 03:06:19.101
REVIEWED THE AUDIT AND I SIGNED

03:06:19.167 --> 03:06:20.602
A VERY CLEAR THAT NEED WANT TO

03:06:20.669 --> 03:06:22.137
THE AUDIT THIS WASN'T. AUDIT

03:06:22.204 --> 03:06:24.506
DONE BY A PRIVATE COMPANY-

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:28.777
HIRED BY CDA. THE AUDIT FAN

03:06:28.844 --> 03:06:30.379
THAT IT WAS READ READER OR

03:06:30.445 --> 03:06:32.481
BORROW- AND NOT SPECIFIC

03:06:32.548 --> 03:06:35.017
SPECIFY HOW IT. THE DOLLARS.

03:06:35.083 --> 03:06:37.886
WERE USED THAT BEING SAID WE DO

03:06:37.953 --> 03:06:39.054
KNOW THAT CA HAS ENGAGES IN A

03:06:39.121 --> 03:06:40.656
WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES

03:06:40.722 --> 03:06:42.658
RANGING FROM. MY TRAINING TO

03:06:42.724 --> 03:06:45.894
LOBBYING ACTIVITY- IN TERMS OF

03:06:45.961 --> 03:06:47.396
HOW SPECIFICALLY THE DOLLARS

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:49.131
ARE USED TO THAT IS A QUESTION

03:06:49.197 --> 03:06:50.432
THAT IS BETTER ANSWERED BY CDA

03:06:50.499 --> 03:06:52.467
AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT ABLE

03:06:52.534 --> 03:06:52.935
TO PROVIDE KIND OF THE

03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:54.703
PARTICULAR DETAILS. OF HOW

03:06:54.770 --> 03:06:56.705
THOSE DOLLARS REAIS I HAVE ONE

03:06:56.772 --> 03:06:58.206
LAST QUESTION AND SO TO THE

03:06:58.273 --> 03:06:59.274
EXTENT THAT YOU MENTION THAT

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:00.576
CITY AREAS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE

03:07:00.642 --> 03:07:03.478
RESOURCES ON HAND. TO REPLENISH

03:07:03.545 --> 03:07:05.447
THOSE FUNDS IT DID THAT MEANS

03:07:05.514 --> 03:07:07.549
THOSE FUNDS EXCEED CTA'S OTHER

03:07:07.616 --> 03:07:09.618
RESOURCES M. IS THAT CORRECT IS

03:07:09.685 --> 03:07:11.253
WHICH TO THAT'S KIND OF

03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:13.355
ALARMING IF THIS WAS FIRST

03:07:13.422 --> 03:07:13.889
GOING TO A SPECIAL COUNTY

03:07:13.956 --> 03:07:15.891
ADDITION SYSTEM. OTHER USES AND

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:16.925
I GUESS THE BETTER NOW TUNES

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:18.727
AND CORTESE'S LAWYER IT'S YEAH

03:07:18.794 --> 03:07:20.729
IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CONCERN.

03:07:20.796 --> 03:07:22.331
WHO SEEMS TO BE SPENDING IN A

03:07:22.397 --> 03:07:23.098
ONE CLIENTS FUNDS FOR OTHER

03:07:23.165 --> 03:07:27.102
PURPOSES- AND SO. TO THE EXTENT

03:07:27.169 --> 03:07:28.904
THAT THIS DOESN'T SOUND GOOD

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:31.940
WITH HIS WAS IT REFERRED BEYOND

03:07:32.007 --> 03:07:34.176
THE AUDIT MISLEAD SEEMS LIKE IT

03:07:34.242 --> 03:07:37.212
MIGHT JUSTIFY. ADDITIONAL

03:07:37.279 --> 03:07:44.119
EXAMINATION. EVEN BY THE

03:07:44.186 --> 03:07:45.587
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. HE

03:07:45.654 --> 03:07:47.856
STILL IS RE QUESTIONS. ABOUT

03:07:47.923 --> 03:07:49.625
OTHER FIVE. THAT BEEN PROVIDE

03:07:49.691 --> 03:07:52.194
TO CDA FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO AN

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:54.396
EXAMPLE ON THEIR IT RELATES TO

03:07:54.463 --> 03:07:54.963
THE YOU KNOW THE HIGH TECH

03:07:55.030 --> 03:07:56.098
CRIMES THAT WE GET IS AN

03:07:56.164 --> 03:07:57.899
EXAMPLE OF A STREAM OF FUNDING

03:07:57.966 --> 03:07:58.834
THE ASSET FORFEITURE DOLLARS

03:07:58.900 --> 03:08:00.302
ETCETERA. AND SO OUR

03:08:00.369 --> 03:08:01.837
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE

03:08:01.903 --> 03:08:04.706
FUNDS ARE NOW- POTENTIALLY

03:08:04.773 --> 03:08:07.309
UNDER SCRUTINY WE ARE NOT AWARE

03:08:07.376 --> 03:08:09.444
OF AN AUDIT SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS

03:08:09.511 --> 03:08:10.112
CONDUCTED ON THESE

03:08:10.178 --> 03:08:11.546
ENVIRONMENTAL WORKER SAFETY

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:13.415
FINES HAVING BEEN TIME. BUT WE

03:08:13.482 --> 03:08:14.716
ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS

03:08:14.783 --> 03:08:16.284
POTENTIALLY SCREWED ME OUT

03:08:16.351 --> 03:08:20.756
THERE FROM BOTH CA. AND MAYBE

03:08:20.822 --> 03:08:23.892
OTHERS. PRESHEAF GO TO THE

03:08:23.959 --> 03:08:26.328
MINISTRY BE WORTH OF. SO ELSE

03:08:26.395 --> 03:08:30.032
THANK YOU FOR. YEP I FOR THE

03:08:30.098 --> 03:08:31.800
QUESTION FOR ME IS WEEKLY. AS

03:08:31.867 --> 03:08:35.037
BUT IS THE EIGHT AND OUR TRUST

03:08:35.103 --> 03:08:36.972
AND- TO SPEND THINGS A CERTAIN

03:08:37.039 --> 03:08:38.440
WAY THEY DON'T GET ALL OF THEIR

03:08:38.507 --> 03:08:40.409
FUNDING FROM US BUT THEY GET A

03:08:40.475 --> 03:08:42.744
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING

03:08:42.811 --> 03:08:45.881

MAP AS AS YOU CREATE I DON'T

03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:15.182
WANT TO DO THAT I THINK WHAT

03:28:15.249 --> 03:28:16.684
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS TO-

03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:18.886
SEPARATE ISSUES THE FIRST IS AS

03:28:18.953 --> 03:28:20.421
I DISCUSSED IN MY PRESENTATION

03:28:20.487 --> 03:28:25.226
THERE'S A TRADITIONAL- INDIGENT

03:28:25.292 --> 03:28:25.893
REPRESENTATION THAT MOST PEOPLE.

03:28:25.960 --> 03:28:28.062

REPRESENT THE BECAUSE OUR

03:28:37.304 --> 03:28:38.772
INDIGENT AND IT'S TO GO TO

03:28:38.839 --> 03:28:40.875
TRIAL. THAT PART OF OUR

03:28:40.941 --> 03:28:42.710
PRACTICE IS ALWAYS BEEN A

03:28:42.776 --> 03:28:45.179
DISPROPORTIONATE- BECAUSE OF

03:28:45.246 --> 03:28:46.747
RESOURCES AS I'VE INDICATED

03:28:46.814 --> 03:28:49.783
BEFORE. HAVE COME. TO THIS

03:28:49.850 --> 03:28:51.218
COUNTRY'S OFFICE. VARIOUS

03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:52.753
RESOURCES NOT JUST THE COUNTIES

03:28:52.820 --> 03:28:54.788
IN WHICH- THEY RESIDE OUR

03:28:54.855 --> 03:28:56.490
RESOURCES HAVE PREDOMINANTLY

03:28:56.557 --> 03:28:58.692
COME OVER HISTORICALLY FROM

03:28:58.759 --> 03:29:01.028
JETSTAR COUNTIES. AS A STATE

03:29:01.095 --> 03:29:02.830
HAS DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITY

03:29:02.897 --> 03:29:04.632
FOR INJURED RESPECT THE FENCE

03:29:04.698 --> 03:29:07.968
OF THE STATE- EXISTENCE THE

03:29:08.035 --> 03:29:09.703
COUNTY- DEVIZES ACROSS

03:29:09.770 --> 03:29:12.439
CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT IS ONE

03:29:12.506 --> 03:29:15.142
MODEL AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

03:29:15.209 --> 03:29:17.411
AT TIMES FELT. AND STILL

03:29:17.478 --> 03:29:19.647
COMPUTER STILL. THE RESOURCE

03:29:19.713 --> 03:29:24.218
ALLOCATIONS IS UNBALANCED- WHAT

03:29:24.285 --> 03:29:26.086
WE HAVE IS QUITE FRANKLY AND I

03:29:26.153 --> 03:29:27.821
DON'T THINK CANDIDLY INCREDIBLY

03:29:27.888 --> 03:29:31.091
DILIGENCE- COMMITTED. PUBLIC

03:29:31.158 --> 03:29:32.493
DEFENDERS AND WHEN I SAY PUBLIC

03:29:32.559 --> 03:29:34.295
DEFENDERS I DON'T MEAN ME I AM

03:29:34.361 --> 03:29:35.496
COMMITTED TO THE WORK I DO BUT

03:29:35.562 --> 03:29:37.131
I MEAN THE LAWYERS THAT

03:29:37.197 --> 03:29:38.399
MISSILES AND I HAVE IN OUR

03:29:38.465 --> 03:29:41.769
OFFICE WHO- SPARE NO TIME

03:29:41.835 --> 03:29:46.774
ENERGY OR PART OF THEIR LIVES.

03:29:46.840 --> 03:29:47.274
TO PROTECT THEIR CLIENTS

03:29:47.341 --> 03:29:47.841
PROTECT OUR CLIENTS. WHAT'S

03:29:47.908 --> 03:29:49.476
CHANGED NOW AS I MENTIONED

03:29:49.543 --> 03:29:52.146
DRASTICALLY IS. THE

03:29:52.212 --> 03:29:53.747
RESPONSIBILITY OF PUBLIC

03:29:53.814 --> 03:29:55.582
DEFENDERS WELL IGNITED. IS

03:29:55.649 --> 03:29:58.419
RESPONSIVE WE TAKE ON GLADLY TO

03:29:58.485 --> 03:30:01.755
ADDRESS OF THE LAWS OF THE PAST

03:30:01.822 --> 03:30:03.590
THAT CREATED MASS INCARCERATION.

03:30:03.657 --> 03:30:06.293
THAT WE NOW HAVE A SECOND BITE

03:30:06.360 --> 03:30:07.494
AT THE APPLE SO TO SPEAK TO BE

03:30:07.561 --> 03:30:10.597
ABLE TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS

03:30:10.664 --> 03:30:11.832
THAT WE WORKED WITH BEFORE DO

03:30:11.899 --> 03:30:12.900
YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO COME

03:30:12.967 --> 03:30:14.868
HOME. TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR

03:30:14.935 --> 03:30:16.704
FAMILY A RATHER THAN THE REST

03:30:16.770 --> 03:30:18.539
OF THEIR LIFE IN PRISON THAT

03:30:18.605 --> 03:30:20.975
TYPE OF WORK. WE ARE WE WILL

03:30:21.041 --> 03:30:23.110
HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THAT

03:30:23.177 --> 03:30:24.945
WHEN THE LEGISLATURES PASSED.

03:30:25.012 --> 03:30:26.280
NEW LAWS ALLOWING THAT TO

03:30:26.347 --> 03:30:29.750
HAPPEN THEY COME AND FIND IT-QUITE HONESTLY AND SO WE HAVE

03:30:29.817 --> 03:30:31.352
HAD TO TAKE IT OUT OF HIGH FOR

03:30:31.418 --> 03:30:32.720
LACK OF A BETTER TERM.

03:30:32.786 --> 03:30:35.155
EFFECTUATEWHAT WE CONSIDER TO

03:30:35.222 --> 03:30:37.691
BE OUR OBLIGATION AND QUITE

03:30:37.758 --> 03:30:38.993
FRANKLY I THINK THAT WE WOULD

03:30:39.059 --> 03:30:40.928
BE DIFFICULT FOR MISSILE CENTER

03:30:40.995 --> 03:30:42.763
MYSELF OR ANY OF OUR PEERS TO

03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:43.931
CONVINCE OUR ATTORNEYS YOU

03:30:43.998 --> 03:30:45.232
THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT NOT TO DO

03:30:45.299 --> 03:30:47.568
THIS. IT IS A COMMITMENT TO

03:30:47.634 --> 03:30:50.337
HELPING OUR CLIENTS. BEFORE

03:30:50.404 --> 03:30:53.140
DURING AND AFTER. A CONVICTION

03:30:53.207 --> 03:30:54.541
AND SO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWERS

03:30:54.608 --> 03:30:55.476
A QUESTION WITHOUT AGAIN I

03:30:55.542 --> 03:30:57.711
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A ROAD MAP

03:30:57.778 --> 03:31:00.047
FOR ANYONE. BUT THERE IS NO

03:31:00.114 --> 03:31:02.216
QUESTION ABOUT THE YEAH YOUR

03:31:02.282 --> 03:31:07.588
BALANCE LAST YEAR I. THINK IT

03:31:07.654 --> 03:31:08.155
WAS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HERE

03:31:08.222 --> 03:31:08.789

03:31:18.932 --> 03:31:20.968
OF THE- THINGS THAT OUT TO ME

03:31:21.035 --> 03:31:23.737
THE MOST WAS THE SUPPORT STAFF

03:31:23.804 --> 03:31:26.373
ALLOCATION SO THEY'RE FINDING

03:31:26.440 --> 03:31:27.341
WAS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY

03:31:27.408 --> 03:31:29.009
PERCENT. OF THE STAFF THE

03:31:29.076 --> 03:31:30.277
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICER

03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:32.679
TOURNEY WHILE 40% OF THAT

03:31:32.746 --> 03:31:34.948
STAFF. ARE SUPPORT STAFF AND

03:31:35.015 --> 03:31:37.317
THE INVERSE IS TRUE DISCOVERIES

03:31:37.384 --> 03:31:39.920
40% ARE CHINESE AND 60% OUR

03:31:39.987 --> 03:31:41.321

PARALEGALS HE ELEMENT. IT LEGAL

03:31:45.092 --> 03:31:47.361
PRACTICE. BECAUSE OF THAT

03:31:47.428 --> 03:31:49.930
INVERSION FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS

03:31:49.997 --> 03:31:52.533
ARE. I'M FORTY FORCED TO DO

03:31:52.599 --> 03:31:54.902
MUCH OF THE NON PUBLIC DEFENDER

03:31:54.968 --> 03:31:56.537
WORK THAT IS CLEAR OR THE

03:31:56.603 --> 03:31:57.938
RESEARCH IT COULD BE BETTER

03:31:58.005 --> 03:32:01.008
DONE BY EXPERTS SUCH AS SOCIAL.

03:32:01.075 --> 03:32:03.610
AND THEY COULD FOCUS OUR ENERGY

03:32:03.677 --> 03:32:05.746
ON THE LORD WHICH IS. WHAT WE

03:32:05.813 --> 03:32:09.216

THE PASSION AND I'VE SEEN IT

03:32:17.291 --> 03:32:19.493

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:21.628
IS PERSONS ON THAT- IT JUST

03:32:21.695 --> 03:32:23.730

BE MORE DILIGENT AND PASSIONATE

03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:27.000
PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK IT

03:32:27.067 --> 03:32:28.502
WOULD DIMINISH THE PASSION OF

03:32:28.569 --> 03:32:29.536
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY

03:32:29.603 --> 03:32:34.408
