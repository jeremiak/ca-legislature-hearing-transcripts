MY HOPE IS TO GET THROUGH THESE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT WILL BE TAKEN WE WILL ALLOW. TO FOLKS ON A PORT OPPOSITION TO TESTIFIED FOR A STRICT TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU GO OVER YOUR TIME TO GET FOUR MINUTES AND I'M AND CUT YOU OFF.

NINE NINE TWO AS A CONSENT ITEM IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS IN ALSO S. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A CONSENSUS LOW FAT IS. IN THAT I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING A ONE ONE ZERO EIGHT ONE ONE FIVE TO TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE YES SIR THANK YOU. THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE YEAH [inaudible] OKAY. I'M YOU MAY PROCEED TO ANSWER WITH ELEVEN I WAIT YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON JANUARY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN POLICY BY ALLOWING THE STATES TO CONVEY. THE CONDITION THE MEDICAID COVERAGE AND WORK. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES THE UNDERLYING THEORY BEHIND THE WORK REQUIREMENT IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT WORKING CHOOSE TO BE UNEMPLOYED. BUT THERE MAJOR FLAWS IN THE THINKING FIRST OFF MOST MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WHO CAN WORK ALREADY DO SO. POSING WORK REQUIREMENTS WILL ALSO OVER THE BURN SOME PAPERWORK RESULT IN HIGHER STATING COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN A LEADER IN THE IMPLEMENTATION THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST GAINS OF COVERAGE IN THIS COUNTRY. MAKING MEDI CAL CONTINGENT WORK REQUIREMENTS IS A STEP BACKWARDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I DON'T HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIKE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING CHEN FLOOR ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER AND ONLINE POVERTY THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL I THINK THE POLICY REASONS ARE EVIDENT ON WHY WE NEED THIS BILL AND WHY WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION HERE IN THE STATE. AYE AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE FISCAL EFFECTS ARE NEGLIGIBLE -- AND SHOULD WE EVER BE IN A POSITION WHERE CMS IS TRYING TO REQUIRE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HAVE WORK REQUIREMENTS AS WE'VE SEEN THEM DOUBLE DOWN IN APPROVAL LOT OF STATE. WAIVERS AND FIGHT A COURT CASE PROVE THEIR APPROVAL OF A WAIVER WE WOULD WANT THOSE ISSUES TO COME BACK TO THE ANY ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. CAN REALLY TELL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT. MARY VALDEZ HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ARE THERE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE DEPARTMENT FINANCE.% GOOD MORNING TO TELL ME ASSURE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OTHER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOES NOT HAVE A FISCAL ESTIMATE AS THIS BILL RELATES TO FUTURE WAIVERS. HOWEVER FINANCE NOTES THAT LIMITING STATE FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE WAIVERS MAY LIMIT FUTURE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. SEEN NO QUESTIONS THIS ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WE GET AT COMMITTEE THE LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE A VOTE HERE -- WHICH LIKE BECAUSE OF RESPECT FOR US FROM IBM AND CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU OKAY. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO NO IT ALSO ENJOYS A DO YOU PASS AS IT'S THE NEXT TIME. YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE SOME QUESTIONS ON THIS LET ME START BY SAYING WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF HOW AND THE BILL AS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU ON SEVEN AMENDMENTS. SO -- THE AMENDMENT SPECIFIED BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE LIST OF SERVICES BE PROVIDED IN A CLINICAL CARE AREA UNLESS MEDICALLY INDICATED. THEY REMOVE LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE DESTINATION TO BE IDENTIFIED AS SAFE AND APPROPRIATE IN CHANGES TRANSPORTATION STANDARD TO THIRTY MILES OR THIRTY MINUTES. THERE'S ALSO OTHER MINOR CHANGES -- AND IT REQUIRES HOUSE MUST INCLUDE A WRITTEN HOMELESS PATIENT DISCHARGE PLANNING POLICY PROCESS WITHIN ITS ESTABLISH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE POLICY WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ON THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO IMPROVE THE WAY HOMELESS PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITALS. MY STAFF AND SPONSORS HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS TO ADDRESS. MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE CAN. AS PART OF THE EFFORT I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING THE WORK OUT WITH YOUR STAFF WHICH REDUCES HOW FAR HOSPITALS. ARE OBLIGATED TO OFFER TRANSPORTATION AND CLARIFIES AND NONCLINICAL THINGS LIKE OFFERING A MEAL WHICH CAN BE PROVIDED OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL AREA. SAYS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF EMERGENCY ROOMS WITH THESE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE MUCH BETTER POSITION WITH A HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY. EVEN IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE THEIR OPPOSITION ENTIRELY WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I VOTE. SPEAKERS IT'S FINE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KIMBERLY CHEN OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK PARTY A CO SPONSOR OF S. B.. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA'S FACING TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES AND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSE WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CARING FOR THIS. VERY VULNERABLE POPULATION THIS BILL WOULD HELP WOMEN OR EVEN PREVENT COSTS RELATED TO HOSPITAL READMISSIONS SETTING A REASONABLE HUMANE STANDARD FOR HOSPITALS CARE FOR THIS POPULATION. STUDIES SHOW THAT YOU HOMELESS PATIENTS HAVE HIGHER READMISSION RATES OF THE OTHER PATIENTS AND OFTENTIMES -- FOLKS LAND RIGHT BACK IN THE YOUR AFTER BEING DISCHARGED THIS CAUSES PRESSURES ON EMERGENCY RESPONDERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SEE PATIENTS CYCLE THROUGH. HIS COSTS INCURRED BY TAXPAYERS WHO PAY FOR THESE LITTLE SERVICES THEIR COST OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET WHEN A PERSON'S CONDITION DETERIORATES BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T -- PROPERLY CARE FOR AND DISCHARGE IN THE FIRST PLACE. STUDIES SHOW THAT COSTS -- RELATED TO FREQUENT AND PREVENTABLE HAAS MISSIONS CAN BE LIMITED THROUGH DISCHARGE PLANNING AND SERVICE CORPS NATION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. THIS BILL SUCH A CLEAR PROTOCOL THAT WILL ENABLE HOSPITALS TO PROPERLY TREAT THESE PATIENTS AND MAKE ONE HAND OFF SOCIAL SERVICES HOUSING. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IPHONE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ACTUALLY I'M. NO SPAM EQUIPMENT LIKE TO ESTABLISH HAPPY FOR HIM OR EGGMAN SECRETARY [inaudible] GONZALEZ FLETCHER [inaudible] BIGELOW [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] BONTA [inaudible] GROW THEIR CALDERON [inaudible] CARILLO [inaudible] CHAPTER EGGMAN [inaudible] FONG [inaudible] READ GALLAGHER. GARCIA. THIS AREA. OBERNOLTE. QUIRK AND REYES HERE. THANK YOU RENOWNED FULL COMMITTEE. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MITCHELL COVERED IT UP WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND WE REPRESENT HOSPITAL WORKERS INCLUDING SOCIAL WORKERS WHO DO DISCHARGE PLANNING BECAUSE CALIFORNIA LAW ALREADY REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DISCHARGE PATIENTS. AND WHAT WE NOTICED ABOUT EXISTING LAW IS THAT IT IS WRITTEN WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE A HOME AND FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO GO TO ONCE THEY ARE DISCHARGED. AND SO WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GAP IN EXISTING ONE THAT IT DID NOT PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR WHAT TO DO WHEN THAT PERSON HAS NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS. THIS LAW SEEKS TO SPELL SET OUT DOWN THE REASONABLE STANDARD FOR WHAT THE FOR WOULD BE WHAT'S THE MINIMUM REQUIRED -- WE ATTEMPTED TO OF WORKOUT REASONABLE SOLUTIONS WITH THE HOSPITAL'S TAKING OVER TWENTY FIVE AMENDMENTS TO ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS -- AND SO WE THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN WHAT MOST HOSPITALS ARE ALREADY DOING IT I HAVE TO SAY THAT MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS GO FAR ABOVE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. BUT WE WANTED TO SET A HUMANE -- FOR FOR TO CATCH SOME OF THOSE OUT LIARS OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE WE WERE SEEING PATIENTS ROUTINELY DESTRUCTION HOSPITAL GOWNS OR TWO LOCATIONS THAT WERE UNKNOWN TO THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS VERY TIMELY IN THAT IN THIS AREA WHERE WE HAVE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ARCHER I THOUGHT ON THIS MAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARY VALDEZ HEALTH ACTS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. GEN FLORI WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. IF WE MAKE SOME ROOM UP AT THE AYE I'M ASSUMING THERE'S A PRESENTATION AND OPPOSITION TO MY ROOM [inaudible] THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR HIS STAFF IN THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH US OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THEY HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS WHICH DEFINITELY HAVE HELPED. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED FOR TWO PRIMARY REASONS THE FIRST REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THE BILL. THIS WOULD ALLOW A LOCAL CITY OR COUNTY TO PUT IN PLACE LAWS THAT ARE STRICTER THAN WATER IN S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY TWO WE SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH THIS WEEK WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL SHOULD BE THERE FLOOR WE THINK IT SHOULD BE THE CEILING AT LEAST FOR NOW. SECONDLY THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AROUND THE COORDINATION OF REFERRALS WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLY WITH IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT RESOURCES IN EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY TO WHICH WE CAN. SEND TO THESE PEOPLE. TO ON A WEAK CARE FOR THESE PEOPLE BUT WHEN WE ARE. DONE GIVING THEM MEDICAL CARE SOMETIMES THERE ARE NOT SOCIAL SERVICES AND BAILABLE IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY. SO THAT IS THE DILEMMA WE OFTEN FIND OURSELVES IN. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST OPPOSITION. CAPTION HOUSE GOT WITH UNITED HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS COMMENTS I WOULD ADD THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS WILL HAVE ON THE ARE AS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT STUDIES. IPR DELAYS AREN'T GETTING SHORTER THEY'RE GETTING LONGER AND I THINK AS WE HELP MANAGE THIS POPULATION WERE CONCERNED HOW THE EFFECTS OF THIS BILL WILL MANAGE THOSE YOUR ABILITIES. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THEO PALES REPRESENTING TEN AND HOSPITALS WE ALSO REMAIN OPPOSED. A COUPLE OF REAL QUICK POINTS ONE AM TO I'M SORRY. TO SWEEP HER NAME CAMP THANK HIM UP. THING CAO. NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION SHORT WHERE AGAIN ABOUT THE HOSPITAL CORPORATION OPPOSE. START OFF BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I THINK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR CAN TALK TO US BUT WE REMAIN OPPOSED LESSON IN A POSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. WE DO NOT HAVE A COST ESTIMATE -- ON THE BILL WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME HOWEVER OF FINANCE HAS TAKEN ON A POST POSITION TO THE BILL -- AS AMENDED ON AUGUST SIXTH BECAUSE IT MAY CREATE COST PRESSURES ON HEALTH CARE PAYERS INCLUDING MEDICAL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] DOCTOR QUIRK. OUR SO WITH THE RECENT AMENDMENTS. IS THE COMMITTEE -- FINDING THAT THIS WOULD COST THE UC HOSPITALS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS STILL ARE IN THE FACT. YEAH THE REASON I'M THIS DOESN'T GO TO SUSPENSE THAT THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT WILL COST AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AT HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS HOWEVER THOSE COSTS WILL BE FUNDED BY PATIENT CARE REVENUE NOT DIRECTLY BY STATE AND SO OKAY WITH A PATIENT THERE IS A COST OBVIOUSLY TO YOU SEE IN THE US DEPARTMENT HOSPITALS. TO RIGHT AND WHEN WE SAY PATIENT CARE REVENUES OF THAT MEANS. WHAT PEOPLE PAY IN THE HOSPITAL FROM INSURANCE FROM COPAYS NOW FOR MEDI CAL ETCETERA? OKAY -- SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THE HOSPITALS IN. ALAMEDA COUNTY HAPPENS -- RIGHT AND LEFT WE HAVE TO THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER BY THE COUNTY. WHICH CAN BARELY AFFORD TO KEEP THEM OPEN. AND WE HAVE ST ROSE HOSPITAL ARMS I THINK THE LAST PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN -- THAT'S NINETY THEY'RE PART OF A HOSPITAL DISTRICT ARE PART OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM. OUR OTHER THAN SUTTER. HIS CLOSING HOSPITALS ANYWAY -- IT'S LIKE IT'S THE ONLY. HOSPITAL IT TAKES THE HOMELESS FRANKLY IN MY AREA -- OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY AND IF THEY HAVE TO BRING ON MORE SOCIAL WORKERS IT CETERA IT COULD BRING THEM OVER THE BRINK TO BANKRUPTCY. NO I AGREE WITH ALL THE POLICY THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. IN IF THERE WERE STATE FUNDS TO FUND SOCIAL WORKERS HOUSE SCENE AT CETERA. I BE HOT BEHIND IT A 100% BUT I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT MY LOCAL SAINT ROSE HOSPITAL IN HAYWARD. GOING OVER THE DEEP END -- THANK YOU SO MUCH MR QUICKEN YES ST ROSE IS ONE OF OUR KEY SAFETY NET PROVIDERS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME SHOULDERING A LOT OF THE SAFETY NET OBLIGATIONS IN THE REGION. AND IT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE TOOK AS MANY AMENDMENTS AS WE DID TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ON THE OF THE BILL OR NOT ONEROUS IN ADDITION -- WE WOULD SAY THAT WITH OUR SAFETY NET EMPLOYERS THEY ALREADY DO A LOT OF WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THIS BILL AND THIS BILL IS DRAWN FROM THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT DAY IN DAY OUT SEE THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND ARE. ARE ACTUALLY MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL ALREADY WITH THEIR SOCIAL WORKERS I'M ONE MORE THING ALL SAY IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WE THOUGHT THAT THEIR ESTIMATE. FOR THE UC'S WAS HIGH AND BELIEVE THAT THERE'S INDICATION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE REVISING THOSE ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE WE WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. ALRIGHT WELL I'LL OVER FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M GOING TO BE. CHECKING UP ON THIS WITH MY LOCALS THANK YOU. MISS KOREA. UP FIRST WOULD I'M SORRY DOES APARTMENT FINANCE WANTED TO RESPOND TO THAT ARE RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO I JUST WASN'T SURE. WE DO HAVE UPDATED YOU SEE COSTS -- BUT THEY ARE STILL ON SIGNIFICANT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MISCREANT. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS UM AS WELL AS THE OPPOSITION FOR YOUR POINTS TODAY I'M YOU KNOW. LA COUNTY CITY OF LOS ANGELES LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN STATE. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL WHICH RECEIVES THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN OUR COUNTY AND I BELIEVE THE STATE. BOB WHAT THEY CURRENTLY DO FOUND THE CITY OF LA HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED SOME WARNINGS AS WELL. A CURIOUS AS TO THE IMPACT TO THAT AND I BELIEVE THE IMPACT TO THE STATE. PUBLIC VOTING YES ON IT NOW BUT I DO WANNA DO SOME FOLLOW UP INCENTIVE DEPENDENCE ON WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE AND WHAT WE DO DO. FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE UPSET. SO WE REPRESENT WORKERS AT LA SEE USC WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER IN LA COUNTY FOR HOMELESS SERVICES AND YOU'RE CORRECT THE LA CITY ATTORNEY HAS A LOCAL ORDINANCE -- BECAUSE THERE WAS A PATTERN OF IMPROPER PATIENT DISCHARGES IN GENERAL IN THE COUNTY AND THAT RESTRICTS WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE DISCHARGED AND AGAIN GOES MUCH FURTHER -- ABOVE THEIR REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO SAY THAT LA COUNTY LA CITY HOSPITALS. ALREADY EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL SO THEY'RE SORT OF CONTAINED UNDER AT A STANDARD ABOVE -- WE TOOK THE PRE -- AMENDMENT IN THE BILL -- BECAUSE LA CITY ATTORNEY FEAR ASKED US -- TO HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEAL WITH -- THIS ONGOING SITUATION IN LA AND IT DOES SORT OF GET TO SOME OF THAN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FACILITIES LA SEE USC FOR EXAMPLE ALREADY HAS AN ENTIRE WAITING ROOM DEDICATED TO DEALING WITH PATIENT DISCHARGES IN GENERAL FOR EVERYBODY AND SO. THEY ARE SUPER WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THIS POPULATION THEY DO IT EVERY DAY OUR MEMBERS HAVE FLOODING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- AND THEY SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING EVERYBODY UP TO A SIMILAR STANDARD BECAUSE THE SAFETY NET AS I SAID IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK REALLY WELL [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR. IF IF I COULD ADD NOW. I'M SORRY. IF THERE'S THAT AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE IT. THAT WAS DIRECTED DOT COM THE PROPONENTS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IF NOT I'D SAY THIS -- JUST ENJOY A DAY PASS I THINK AT THAT FIGHT GIVEN THE FINANCIALS IT WAS A KIND OF BIZARRE SITUATION BECAUSE WE LOOK AT YOU SEE COSTS AN ARM. IN THE SITUATION IT'S NOT AI PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND -- SO IT IS. FISCALLY A BILL THAT -- WE SUPPORT. AND WILL PUT OUT BUT I'M I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN STATED CONCERNS NOT ONLY FOR MEMBERS ON THIS COMITTEE BUT A NUMBER OF OTHER MEMBERS THAT I WOULD SUGGEST I'M I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AROUND THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE. AND IT WAS GOOD TO SEE IT IS LA CITY THAT CAUSED THE PREEMPTION LANGUAGE WHICH IS NOW CAUSING OTHER PEOPLE ANXIETY -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY I KNOW THERE'S NO DESIRE TAKEN AMENDMENT ON THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE FOR YOU -- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THIS BILL AND I THINK PROBABLY OTHER PEOPLE FEEL THIS WAY IN SAN DIEGO WE'VE HAD A HUGE PROBLEM WITH UCSD IN PARTICULAR. DISCHARGING PEOPLE WHEN I FIRST READ THE BILL I SAID THANK GOD BECAUSE I AM TIRED OF SEEING PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREET YOU NOW. HALF EXPOSED IN A HOSPITAL GOWN AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEM IT'S NOT THAT FAR COMMUNITY AND I'M I I THINK THERE ARE SOME NECESSARY STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN THAT ARE BEING TAKEN A LOT OF TIMES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- I JUST ADDED I JUST HOPE I'M SHOULD MOVE FOR TODAY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AS WELL. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES IT WOULD MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OUT WITH LA TO DO IS JUST TALK ABOUT COMING FULL CIRCLE. WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY ON TWELVE YEARS AGO I SAT IN THIS ROOM AND THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE AND A VERY SIMILAR BILL CAME UP? THEN SENATOR GIL STUDIO AND IT WAS A MUCH MUCH MORE CONTENTIOUS BILLS MANUFACTURE WAS TALKING HOUSE WILL SOLICITATION HOW DIFFICULT THAT WAS IN THE THE DECISION I HAVE TO MAKE. IT DEALT WITH PENALTIES IF THE HOSPITAL'S DIDN'T DEAL WITH THIS. WELL AS YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO GROW DRAMATICALLY. AND WE'VE READ THE STORIES OVER AND OVER HOW PATIENTS ARE LEFT IN THE STREETS EXACTLY AT YOUR COMMENT. AND HOSPITAL GOWNS AND BAD WEATHER. THIS IS THE MOST VOLATILE POPULATION WE HAVE AND I FELT THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IF ANYTHING LEAST THE CONVERSATION TO DEAL WITH THAT VULNERABLE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE. I MADE A VERY CLEAR TO MY STAFF THAT WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION BUT OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T. THERE IS ACTUALLY NO PENALTIES HERE. AND LET ME JUST RESTATE THIS FOR THE RECORD THE HOSPITALS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY VERY TROUBLING AMONGST OUR SOCIETY. MANY HOSPITALS DO GREAT THINGS AND WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY THE PROPONENTS A LOT OF THE HOSPITALS ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS. SO IN CLOSING I WANT YOU TO SAY THIS IS THE FLOOR YES WE HAVE SOME PREEMPTION ISSUES BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW LIKE THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND. I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING ISSUES WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE'VE CAN'T WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS HAVE TAKEN PROBABLY OVER TWENTY AMENDMENTS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND UNFORTUNATE WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE. TO AGREE TO DISAGREE AND I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE POLICY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS THAT HAVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT NOR THE COURTS. STATUTORY DISCRETION TO IMPOSE OR WAVE THE FIVE YEARS SINCE ENHANCEMENT ON SERIOUS FELONY CONVICTIONS. JUST VERY BRIEFLY MEMBERS YOU KNOW BY RESTORING THE COURT'S DISCRETION WE CAN RETURN TO A SPACE WHERE JUDGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAILOR SENTENCES TO FIT THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND WHILE MOST OF THEM HAPPENS CAN BE DECLINED IF THE JUDGE BELIEVES THERE AND JUST THIS ENHANCEMENT IN CURRENT LAW IS MANDATORY IN ALL CASES. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU AND SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. I I AM AMBER ROSE HOWARD OF CALIFORNIA UNITED FOR RESPONSIBLE BUDGET COALITION OF GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS WORKING ON THIS KINDS OF SENTENCING AYE WE SEE THAT THERE'S JUST A BIAS IN THE COURTS -- RACIALLY BIASED PRACTICES WHEN IT COMES -- TO THE THE ENHANCEMENTS WE SEE THAT -- EVEN IN THE REPORT THAT COMES OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS -- IF THE JUDGES ARE ALLOWED THE DISCRETION MEANT TO LOOK OVER A CASE -- THAT WE WOULD SEE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF SAVINGS I IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OUT WITH A HUNDRED PACES STRICKEN ADAM.

SEE NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL [inaudible] I AM. THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR ME WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS BILL DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I ACTUALLY THINK THIS BILL WILL SAVE THE STATE MONEY. I'M I THINK THE BASICS OF THIS BILL ARE PHENOMENAL IT'S SOMETHING I AGREE WITH THAT WE HAD. I HAD ASKED FOR AMENDMENTS AND SELDOM THAT I WILL RECOMMENDED YOU PASS ASSEMBLY WANTED MY AMENDMENTS BUT I'LL CLARIFY THAT THE REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. AND WILL NOT BE SPRINT FOR WITHOUT CHANGING. TO ALLOW STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF ENHANCEMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO SEX CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN -- FORCIBLE RAPE [inaudible] AND CHILD MOLESTATION AND THE REASON FOR THAT QUITE FRANKLY WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION. IS -- AFTER SCENE AFTER WITNESSING IN FACT ALL OF OUR DISMAY ABOUT JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN THE PROP TURNER CASE. AND HOW MEAN -- SEEN A A LOT OF TIMES WHEN AND JUDICIAL DISCRETION MEANS THAT THE JUDGE THEMSELVES ARE BIASED. AND THE RESULT OF THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPEAT OFFENSES THAT THERE ARE SO AND CRITICAL TO OUR COMMUNITY SAFETY. AND SO WHAT IT COMES TO CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN IT COMES A FORCIBLE RAPE I JUST. IN NOT AT A POINT WITH OUR JUDICIARY YET BECAUSE WE WE AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET THERE WHERE WE HAVE AN UNBIASED IN MORE REPRESENTATIVE -- JUDICIARY THAT DOESN'T JUST SEE DEFENDANTS AS THEMSELVES -- IN AND PERHAPS HAVE AND IN SOME CASES AND MORE LENIENT SENTENCE SEEN -- ON CRIMES THAT ARE* THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE'S A CONNECTION THERE -- BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS I'M I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE DISPLAY WITHOUT THOSE -- EXEMPTIONS AND SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT WE ARE STILL AND I'M GOING TO GET THIS OUT ON A DAY PASS RECOMMENDATION. WAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OUR A WITHOUT WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR THINKING VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE -- YOUR OPPOSITION TODAY AND OUR CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT RELY ON IT TO MOVE TODAY SINCE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO SCHOOL IMPACT AND REALLY KIND THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE IS A POLICY ISSUE. AND I'LL HOPEFULLY WE GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE THAT FULLER DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. ON IN MY OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH MADAME SHE THE LAUNDRY LIST OF THE EXISTING SINCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THAT WOULD CONTINUE THE IMPACT THE POPULATION AND THE CHARGES THAT MADAM CHAIR TALKED ABOUT. AND FUNDAMENTALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE REASON I WAS NOT OPEN TO TAKING AMENDMENTS IS I AM ALSO CLEAR THAT IT WAS A A A LEGISLATURE THAT -- LACK TO THE DIVERSITY WE EXPERIENCED TODAY THIRTY FIVE AND FORTY YEARS THAT PASSED BILLS THAT CREATED THE SITUATION WHICH WE NOW LIVE WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED SINCE ENHANCEMENTS ON THE BOOKS. I COMPLETELY SUPPORT AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE JUDICIARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ON OUR TRIP THAT JUSTICE IS TRULY BOTTOM. BUT I AM NOT COMFORTABLE CONTINUING -- IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH A LEGISLATURE -- THAT LACK OF DIVERSITY THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS AGO WHO TOOK A FAR LEANING ON POSITION ON BEING TOUGH ON CRIME. AND TOUGH ON DRUGS POLICIES THAT WE KNOW NOW THANKS TO RESEARCH AND ARE YOU KNOW HINDSIGHT IS TWENTY TWENTY FAILED MISERABLY AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK AT CERTAIN SAN ENHANCEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD WE EMPOWER THE JUDICIARY TO DO THE JOB THAT WE PAY THEM. AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DO. AND I LOOK TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S JUDICIARY DOES REFLECT THE NEEDS OF THE ONES THAT THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE AND THAT JUSTICE IS INDEED BLIND UNTIL THEN I'M NOT COMFORTABLE CONTINUING ON WITH A SET OF POLICIES THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED -- IN THE TIME ALT WHERE PEOPLE WERE APPROACHING THIS BODY OF THE LAW UNFAIRLY AND SO WITHOUT AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE. ACTUALLY APPRECIATE ONE REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE STILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT RAPE OF AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON IS A VIOLENT FELONY SO YES WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO GO ON RACIAL DIVERSITY GENDER DIVERSITY AND THE WAY WE APPROACH THE LOSS IN THINKING WE WILL WORK ON THAT. FOR SURE. AND THAT NEEDS TO GO ON CALL SIR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] MR MCCASKEY [inaudible] YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU NEED NINE THAT'S HERE GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING I S. B. TO NINETY EIGHT ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION RIGHT THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES THAT THE JUDICIAL CANCEL ANTICIPATES MINOR COSTS. WHITTLE THIS DOWN TO A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR PROTECTION OF A MINIMUM BALANCE AND PEOPLE'S BANK ACCOUNTS AND WITH ME IS JUST A JESSICA PARKER WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. ORIGIN I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTRESS A SECOND BY MISS CARILLO YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST ABOUT THE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SPONSOR SUPPORT. AND JUST TO ADD TO THE FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS -- YOU WITH THAT THAT AMOUNT PROTECTED IS A EXPECTED TO HELP PEOPLE PAY THE RENT. JUST BECAUSE YOU OWN MONEY DOESN'T MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE RENT TO PAY A WE BELIEVE THAT WILL PREVENT HOMELESSNESS FROM ADDICTION -- AND ALSO SAY THE COURTS A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY WILL BE SEEKING RELIEF THROUGH THE COURTS ON AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. YES RONALD COLMAN HERE WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION ALSO HEAR THE SPONSOR IN STRONG SUPPORT CERTAINLY WE'VE HEARD THAT THIS BILL CERTAINLY DOES HAVE MINOR COST TO THE STATE BUT IT DOES HAVE A VERY BIG IMPACT THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE PROTECTED BY. THIS BILL CERTAINLY IF YOU HAVE ALL OF THE MONEY WIPED OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES AND MORE DEBT THEY CAN BUILD UP WITH. DIFFERENT FEES THAT HIT YOUR ACCOUNT SO CERTAINLY -- THAT YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS COULD BE THRUST INTO POVERTY MORE AND WITH SO MANY INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA ON THE EDGE OF POVERTY OR IN POVERTY. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAVE THIS PROTECTION IN PLACE FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. MILLION DOLLARS WOULD HELP ACCESS IN SUPPORT. SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. I THINK WOMEN. NEED TO MAKE SOME ROOM AT THE TABLE. YEAH CHAIR WOMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SORT OF GIPSON I'M HERE WITH ENCORE CAPITAL GROUP IN OPPOSITION TO THE RECENTLY AMENDED THE SENATE BILL. TO NINETY EIGHT I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS DO NOT REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THEY ARE VERY INSIGNIFICANT IT ONLY PRODUCES A BLANKET NO QUESTIONS ASKED. DEBT FORGIVENESS ESSENTIALLY OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A PREVIOUSLY WAS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. BANK LOBBIES ARE A A PROCESS THAT IS A LAST RESORT FOR CREDITORS IN ORDER TO RECOVER ON DEBTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING AFTER YEARS OF ATTEMPTING TO WORK WITH CONSUMERS. THERE'S MULTI MULTIPLE TIMES TO RESOLVE THE OBLIGATIONS WITH CONSUMERS. YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THE TOOL THAT CREDITORS HAVE. TO GET REPAID ON OUT SAYING DOT AND WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT. YOU KNOW THIS SHOULDN'T HELP -- WE SHOULD HELP POOR INCOME CONSUMERS THOSE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY PROTECTED THERE'S A TWO PAGE LIST OF LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF EXEMPTIONS FROM BANK LEVEES. THOSE WHO NEED THE PROTECTION ALREADY GET A BY FILLING OUT A ONE PAGE CLAIMS EXEMPTION FORM. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T KNOW QUESTIONS BLANKET EXEMPTIONS FOR EVERYONE WHETHER YOU'RE LOW INCOME OR HIGH INCOME YOU ARE TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY DECIPHER BETWEEN THOSE WHO NEED THE HELP. AND THOSE WHO DON'T AND THAT WE ABSOLUTELY CANNOT SUPPORT WHEAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS PROTECTS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS IF THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THE PROCESS ITSELF. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS AT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS NO QUESTIONS ASKED EXEMPTION HERE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT. WHEN YOU ESSENTIALLY SAY THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS CAN BE PROTECTED IN SOMEONE'S BANK ACCOUNT THAT IS BANQUET IS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS? TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S AND GOODS AND THE SUBSIDIES THAT HAVE BEEN BORROWED IT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT AS ALONE AS LATE AS OF THE FROM THE DENTIST OFFICE FROM YOUR RETAILER. ANYONE AND EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA NOW CAN SHE'LL TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK ACCOUNT IF THEY'RE MULTIPLE BANK ACCOUNTS THEY CAN SPREAD MONEY BETWEEN AND REPETITIVELY USE IT. AND I KNOW THE BILL SAYS IT'S LIMITED. TO THAT SIMPLY IS UNENFORCEABLE AND ASKING JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO IMPLEMENT FORMS -- TO HAVE EX PARTE APPLICATION WITH THE COURTS THESE ARE ALL VERY COSTLY PROCESSES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT NOW YOU'RE HAVING A LOSS. FOR BUSINESSES FOR RETAILERS AND IT'S A TAX REVENUE LOSS FOR THE STATE SO I DISAGREE JUST BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CAN'T SIZE THOUGH BROAD IMPACT THIS HAS I DISAGREE THAT THIS DID NOT HAVE WITH THIS. DOES NOT HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT AND WITHOUT I PLEASE ASK FOR YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SOURCE I CAN SPEAKER HAS A MINUTE LEFT OKAY. I CRISTINA SPEND ONLY FROM CAL BANKERS AYE WE BELIEVE THIS BILL HAS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE TO VULNERABLE CONSUMERS. WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED BY MULTIPLE MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR LAST YEAR AND I REMEMBER IS STAFF WORKING ON THIS I'M WE BELIEVE THEY CAN DECREASE ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS BISEXUAL ESSENTIALLY. IT CLAIMED ECLIPSING THINK LEVEES I'M LEAVING CREDITORS WITH FEW OPTIONS FOR REQUIRES THAT'S THIS INCENTIVIZING SMALLER SMALL DOLLAR LOW INTEREST LOANS. I'M THE COP AND THE CONCERN IS SUPPORTED BY MULTIPLE RESEARCH STUDIES WHICH ALL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS ON BUT WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE FOR YOU -- REDUCTIONS IN AVAILABLE CREDIT OUT IN AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE MAINSTREAM CREDIT LEAD TO CONSUMERS LOOKING TO PAY DAY LOANS. INSTALLMENT LOANS AND OTHER HIGH PRICED FORMS OF CREDIT TO PAY THEIR BILLS AND I THINK WILD WELL INTENDED -- BY THE PROPONENTS AS WE TO NINETY EIGHT ULTIMATELY HARMS CONSUMERS WHO DEPEND ON CREDIT TO SURVIVE AND PUSHES THEM FURTHER OVER THE EDGE. I AT LONG TERM CREDIT ALSO IMPACT THOSE CONSUMERS ABILITY TO BUILD CREDIT AND HAVE A CREDIT SCORE. ASIDE FROM TO NINETY EIGHT BYPASS ROAD SYSTEM PROTECTIONS IN CREATING AYE ATTENDEES ASSUMPTION.

WE HAVE AN A MOTION BY MISS CREEL AND SECOND BY DOCTOR QUIRK. VERY GOOD I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF THEN -- THIS IS SB THREE TWENTY SEVEN IT SEEKS TO CREATE A COMMONSENSE SECURITY REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES SUCH AS WIRELESS ROUTERS SECURITY CAMERA SMART CITY INFRASTRUCTURE. BY DIRECTING MANUFACTURERS OF SAYS TO EQUIP THEIR PRODUCT WITH REASONABLE SECURITY FEATURES SOMETHING YOU WOULD THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO DO. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT MOST OF THESE -- ENTITIES SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN DOING SO AND WE DO LIVE IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD. WHERE INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES HAVE MOVED WELL BEYOND TRADITIONAL DESKTOP COMPUTERS? UNFORTUNATELY -- OUT WE NEED TO REQUIRE BECAUSE AS I SAID WE'RE NOTSEEING THE MOST BASIC SECURITY FEATURES. SO THIS BILL REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO EQUIP THEIR INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICES -- WITH FEATURES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE MACHINE IN NEWS. AND THOSE COULD INCLUDE THINGS HAS THE ABILITY SIMPLY TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT PASSWORD OR DETECT POTENTIAL HACKERS. THIS BILL ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE IRWIN'S PARALLEL MEASURE A. B. NINETEEN OH SIX RECOGNIZE THE EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF CYBERSECURITY. AND THEREFORE WE GIVE INDUSTRY WIDE LATITUDE IN DETERMINING JUST WHAT PRECISE MEASURES ARE NEEDED FOR EACH PARTICULAR DEVICE BUT PRODUCING AND SELLING. OF THESE DEVICES ARE THAT PUTS OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AT RISK NEEDS TO BE RELEGATED TO THE PAST AND THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THIS. MEASURE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS AND CONTINUES TO REVOLUTIONIZE OUR LIVES BUT IT'S UP TO US AS POLICY MAKERS TO ENSURE THE TECHNOLOGY SERVICE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT SECURITY IS NOT AN AFTER THOUGHT BUT RATHER A KEY COMPONENT OF THE DESIGN PROCESS AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE. THINK YOU AND SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] SPEAKERS OPPOSITION. DANIEL KENDO KAISER ON BEHALF OF COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION IN PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE IN SUPPORT. I DO HAVE ANY SPEAKERS OPPOSITION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OPPOSES THIS BILL BECAUSE IT PLACES CALIFORNIA INTERNET CONNECTED DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. WHILE PROVIDING THE MEANS FOR NON COMPLAINT DEVICES TO ENTER CALIFORNIA'S MARKETPLACE. IF I MAY RESPOND TO THAT -- AYE I THINK FIRST DO YOU VERY MUCH AND DOCTOR QUIRK TOM [inaudible] I AM. WHY DID YOU HAVE A SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE IS THE ENFORCER I'M CONCERNED WE HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED STANDARDS AS TO WHAT REASONABLE LAYERS? YOU HAVE CITY ATTORNEYS -- DE A THESE AS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. WELL WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY HERE BECAUSE WE END TFSA PAID THAT THERE WILL BE BEST PRACTICES AS WE GET PEOPLE INTO THE ROOM. AS WE GET THEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT THESE -- BASIC -- STANDARDS ARE FOR SECURITY WHICH WE ARE. BASICALLY TELLING THEM YOU'VE GOT TO CONSIDER -- SECURITY FEATURES AND THEY THEY CAN BE AND SHOULD BE FRANKLY BASED UPON THE NATURE. THE ITEM THAT IS THAT WE THAT NEEDS THAT SECURITY -- HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE CREATED SO THAT WE WILL FIND COMPANIES IN COMPLIANCE -- IT IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE. ONE I WOULD THINK HIM ONE GROUP DECIDE OR ONE ENTITY ONE ENFORCEMENT ENTITY DECIDE WHAT'S REASONABLE AND WHAT IS NOT REASONABLE -- Y. DIVISION GREED THAT. ARTISTS WILL BE VOTING FOR THE BILL NOW WELL I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH YOU FURTHER AGAIN THANK YOU THE PREMISES WE'VE GOT TO GET THESE COMPANIES TO CONSIDER BASIC SECURITY FEATURES [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS THAT YOUR CLOSE NO MY I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF A OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE DO NOT WANT TO CREATE ANY KIND OF A DISADVANTAGE FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WERE VERY HAPPY TO WORK. TO HONE IN ON WHAT THE WORD MANUFACTURE MEAN SO THAT WE'RE NOT -- AGAIN CREATING THOSE PROBLEMS THAT WE JUST LEARNED OF THIS CONCERN I THINK IT'S A LEGITIMATE ONE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM.

PUSH WATER COSTS IN RESIDENT RESIDENTIAL WATER RATES HIGHER ALL THE TIME. A RISING WATER RATES ARE RESULTING IN HIGHER DELINQUENCY RATES ON WATER BILLS WHICH WHICH IN TURN LEADS TO MORE WATER SHUT OFFS. WHILE THEY'RE CONSISTENT LIFE WHY PROGRAMS FOR ELECTRIC GAS AND TELEPHONE RATE PAYERS THERE'S ONLY A PATCHWORK OF LOCAL POLICIES FOR LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS WHEN THEY BECOME DELINQUENT [inaudible] OF S. B. NINE I WOULD SET A BASIC SET OF GROUND RULES FOR WATER AGENCIES ON THAT ACROSS THE STATE THERE NO MAN TO TERRITORY.

SO I SHUT OFF AND HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES FOR EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES. THIS BILL HAS MINOR COSTS AND INCLUDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR LOW INCOME AND DISABLED RESIDENTS INCREASES TRANSPARENCY AND THE ABILITY TO RESOLVE DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS.

A GOOD MORNING CAO JONES IS HERE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. REBECCA MARCUS REPRESENTING FOOD AND WATER WATCH AND SUPPORT. DAN HOLLIS CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. HE CARES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M WENDY WRITER BUSH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES OR AQUA. BOB WAS PART OF A LARGE COALITION OF OPPOSITION TO SB NINE NINE EIGHT INCLUDING NOT FOR PROFIT WATER AGENCIES COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS AND SOME CITIES THAT PURVEY WATER. THE COALITION REPRESENTS 90% OF THE WATER THAT'S DELIVERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHILE WE CONTINUE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR ACCEPTING PRIOR AMENDMENTS TO THE LEGISLATION THE BILL STILL PROBLEMATIC TO OUR MEMBER AGENCIES. SPECIFICALLY ON THE FISCAL FRONT OR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SHIFTING COSTS FROM ONE SET OF CUSTOMER RATE PAYERS TO ANOTHER -- AND THAT MAYBE IT VIOLATE PROP TWO EIGHTEEN WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IT ALSO MAKES THE COST OF WATER LESS AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE THAT SIT. ABOVE BUT NEAR 22100% FEDERAL POVERTY LINE CONTAINED IN THIS BILL WE ARE CERTAIN WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE GOING TO BE FOR WATER DISTRICTS. THIS UNCERTAINTY WAS UNDERSCORED BY A RECENT LETTER SENT BY FITCH WHICH CONDUCTS RATING REVIEWS FOR PUBLIC WATER DISTRICTS TO ONE OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES UNDER A SECTION TITLED FINANCES IN RATES. FITCH ASK OUR MEMBER TO PLEASE DISCUSS NINE NINE EIGHT WHAT WOULD BE THE IF IF THE EXPECTED FISCAL IMPACT TO THE DISTRICT IF IT WAS PASSED AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED. IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE ANSWER TO THAT AND THAT CONCERNS US RATINGS FROM COMPANIES LIKE FUTURE IMPORTANT AS THEY CAN IMPACT THE RATE AT WHICH WATER DISTRICTS BORROW FUNDING TO HELP PAY FOR LARGE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. LIKE GROUND WATER SPREADING BASINS WATER RECYCLING FACILITIES OR ENLARGEMENT OF THE BUT THE GROUND WATER STORAGE RESERVOIRS FOR EXAMPLE. WATER AGENCIES WORK HARD TO KEEP THE COST OF WATER SERVICE DOWN FOR ALL CUSTOMERS. IT'S FOR THIS FISCAL REASON AND OTHER POLICY REASONS THAT WE'VE LAID OUT IN MULTIPLE -- COMMITTEE HEARINGS THIS YEAR THAT WE CONTINUE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB NINE AND EIGHT THINK THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND JASON AYE OCCURRED WITH IDLE STINK OVER ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION.

STATEWIDE DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE NET THERE WATER SHUT OFF BY A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. WE WOULD TAKE THAT A STEP FATHER FOR A FARTHER AND SAY THAT THERE IS NOT. DATA OR AT LEAST NOT EVIDENCE OR DATA THAT WE HAVE SEEN RELATED TO SHUT OFF FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS -- WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR STAFF -- WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL AND WE ALSO FURTHER AS UPSET HAVEN'T SEEN THE EVIDENCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR TO TO SUPPORT THE PREMISE OF THE BILL.

STUDYING IN PARKS AT THE COMPUTER GENOCIDES ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE COMPUTING COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. MY PARENTS ARE SURVIVORS OF THE COMPLETED GENOCIDE. AND I WAS BORN IN THE REFUGEE CAMP AND IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN I WAS. NINE THE GENOCIDE DEEPLY IMPACT THE SOCIAL FABRIC. AT THE COMPUTER SOCIETY HERE AND ABROAD AND IT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS ARE NOT DISCUSS ABOUT IN OUR SCHOOLS. LEAVING MANY CAMBODIAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TEACHERS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS UNABLE TO FULLY COMPREHEND THE IMPACT THAT IT HOUSE ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. SO I URGE YOU TODAY TO PLEASE SUPPORT S. B. EIGHT NINETY FIVE SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. OUR YOUNG ON THE NEED THE NEXT GENERATION.

SPEAK TODAY SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHT POINT. FIVE MY NAME IS GOING QUITE YOU QUEEN IMUS US CITIZEN AND A SCHOOL TEACHER AT THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL IN KIND OF COLORFUL OFFERED TWENTY FOUR YEARS. IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN I FLED VIETNAM WITH MY FAMILY IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM AND ESCAPE COMMUNIST. PARTY. I NOW LIVE WITH MY HAS BEEN AND ME TO CHILDREN IN ORANGE COUNTY FOR ME UNITED STATES HAS OPENED ITS ARMS TO EMBRACE MY FAMILY. TODAY WITH FIRST CAME TO YOUR ENDS COUNTY CALIFORNIA. I SAID TODAY TO MAKE ONLY ONE REQUEST PLEASE PASS THE S. B. EIGHT FIVE FIVE BILL SO WE CAN BUILD THE CURRICULUM TO TEACH STUDENTS. NOT ONLY IN THE SOUTH CALIFORNIA ABOUT TO TO HISTORY OF VIETNAM WAR THE VIETNAM WAR IS TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY POINT. WHY I WANT TO GIVE EXAMPLE OF THREE GROUPS OF STUDENTS WHO I BELIEVE WILL BENEFIT FROM S. B. EIGHT BY? FIVE THE FIRST GROUP STUDENTS ARE NOT INFORMED OF THAT PACKAGE HISTORY OF VIETNAM IN THE CURRENT HISTORY CLASSES. THREE YEARS AGO I WAS TEACHING WHEN A NON VIETNAMESE STUDENTS CAME UP TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT HE REALLY AT MY HOCHI MINH. I WAS SHOCKED AND VERY SAD. I WAS SHOCKED BECAUSE I GREW UP TO LET THAT PUT YOU CAN WAS A MAN WHO FRONTLINE HORRIBLE ACTS OF VIOLENCE LIKE SAILING AMOUNT TO BUILD. THAT RESULTED IN MILLIONS OF FAMILIES X. SCAPIN THEIR HOMELAND TO SEEK PEACE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. LATER I FOUND OUT THAT MY STUDENTS WERE LED TO BELIEVE WHAT SHE MEANT WAS A HERO BECAUSE OF WHAT HE LEARNED IN HISTORY CLASS WHICH LACKS ADEQUATE DETAILS IN ACCOUNTS. THAT APPROPRIATE DEPICT THE EVENTS OF THE VIETNAM WAR AND POST VIETNAM WAR ERA. SECOND ANOTHER INCIDENTS IN MY ONE OF MY STUDENTS VIETNAMESE CLASS I ASKED THE STUDENTS IF THEY KNEW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PAPER THIRTIETH. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE ONE STUDENT JUST ARRIVED TO U. S. RECENTLY SAID THAT ABLE THIRTY FOUR THIRTIETH NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WAS TO DATE BUT SOUTH VIETNAM WAS LIBERATED. WHEN I HEARD BUT MY HEART DROP? BECAUSE TO BE PICKED DAY WAS TODAY BUT MY HOME WAS TAKING AWAY FROM ME. AND FORCED MY FAMILY TO LEAVE HOW PUBLIC. SO WE CAN SURVIVE. THEY ARE AT THE STUDENT TO SEE IF HE WAS JOKING. BUT HE WAS COMPLETELY SERIOUS. I DID TOOK A TYPE WITH HIM TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT MEANING BETWEEN THE COUNTRY LIBERATED PEDAL LOOSING COUNTRY. THIRD. WHEN DAY MICE MY DAUGHTER? BORN AND RAISED IN THE UNITED STATE PASSED MY HAS SPENT. TO POKE A COMMUNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A HISTORY PROJECT FOR HER VIETNAMESE CULTURE CLASS THAT YOU SEE I IN WHICH SHE WAS ASKED TO INTERVIEW AND RECORD OF FAMILY MEMBERS OF THAT JOURNEY. FROM VIETNAM TO STATES HE WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE KNEW. SO THROUGH THIS PROJECT SHE LEARNED TO DEATH AND ACTIVE THE DIFFICULTIES HER FATHER'S. THAT SHE HAD MADE. NEVER LEARNED HAD NOT BEEN FOR HER TO REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT. THEREFORE I BELIEVE TEACHING THE ATLEAST HISTORY OF THE VIETNAM WAR WITH THE VOICES OF THE PERFORMER REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM SOLDIER AND THE VIETNAMESE REFUGEE AND THE BOOK PEOPLE I INCLUDED WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS UNDERSTAND. THE STRUGGLES OF THE VIETNAMESE REFUGEES WHO ARE NOW A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT TO THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE. I BELIEF THAT THE HISTORY TEACHERS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH THE NECESSARY TOOLS AND RESOURCES TWO APPROPRIATE EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS. THE CURRENT HISTORY VIETNAM HAS NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO INCLUDE TO PROSPECTIVE FOR THE VIETNAMESE REFUGEES OR SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM. BUT ONLY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VIETNAM AND THE U. S.. THEREFORE I BELIEVE THAT THIS CLASS SHOULD BE BENEFIT GOAL THAT IS WILL TEACH THE TRUE STORY OF THE VIETNAM WAR FOR THE PPE CLUB ALL PROSPECTIVE. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART AS A PROUD VIETNAMESE AMERICAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I THINK IT WE'VE SURPASSED SEVEN MINUTES NOW AND I AM A SUCKER AND I'M GONNA ASSUME THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THAT SO WE ARE GOING TO GO.
