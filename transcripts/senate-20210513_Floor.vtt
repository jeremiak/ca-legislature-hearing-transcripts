00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.170
REALITY IS THAT IT IS FRANKLY

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.905
EMBARRASSING IN THIS COUNTRY IN

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.549
COUNTRY TO OTHER COUNTRIES.

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:42.853
IT'S EMBARRASSING- AND THAT

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.655
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:47.424
CITIES AND RURAL CALIFORNIA-

00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:49.493
AND OTHER AREAS THAT LACK GOOD

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.662
ACCESS AND SO WE NEED. THIS

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.430
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:55.065
UNFORTUNATELY I COME FROM LOCAL

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.933
GOVERNMENTS- AND I SPENT YOU

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.503

THE SIGHTING OF CELL. TOWERS I

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.977
KNOW OTHERS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.245
WHO WERE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.880
THIS BODY. HAD THE SAME

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:12.215
EXPERIENCE- AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:15.218
JUST GOT SO TIED UP- IN IN A

00:49:15.285 --> 00:49:16.720
NEIGHBORHOOD POLITICS THAT WE

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.922
NEED A STREAMLINED. APPROACH

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.557
AND I THINK THAT THIS HELPS- TO

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:23.026
PROVIDE THAT- AS WITH- THE

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.361
SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO'S BILL A%

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:26.129
FEW YEARS AGO WHICH IS A

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.097
BROADER VERSION OF THE SPELL

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.933
FRANKLY- THIS BILL CONTINUES IN

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.568
THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. BACK

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:32.569
A FEW YEARS AGO AND IS

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:34.237
IMPORTANT NOW CONTINUES TO

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:36.173
PROVIDE CITIES. WITH

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.342
FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF DESIGN

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:41.044
STANDARDS- AND IN TERMS OF THIS

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:43.246
PRECISE CITING. SO THAT IF THE

00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.748
CITY BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE A

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.416
QUICK NOD IN THIS AREA BUT

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.918
ACROSS THE STREET OR THIRTY

00:49:47.984 --> 00:49:49.086
FEET AWAY THIS IS TOO CLOSE TO

00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:51.855
SOMEONE'S HOUSE. BUT SARAH. THE

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:56.493
CITY. STILL HAS THE FLEXIBILITY.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.627
I FOR THAT'S- CITING PLUS THE

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:58.462
DESIGN STANDARDS SO I THINK

00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:00.564
IT'S A BILL WORTHY OF SUPPORT.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:02.733
I DO WANT TO SAY THIS IS ONE

00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.101
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IN TERMS

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:05.402
OF. ENHANCING THE

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.636
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH WE ARE

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:08.004
BEHIND ON AND WE NEED TO CATCH

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:09.973
UP- BUT IT'S NOT THE WHOLE

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.575
SOLUTION WE SAID WE NEED MORE

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:14.244
COMPETITION. BYE IN TERMS OF

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.612
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:16.847
STILL TOO MANY PARTS OF THE

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:18.382
STATE. WHERE THAT PEOPLE

00:50:18.448 --> 00:50:20.584
AFFECTED WE HAVE ONLY ONE

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.753
OPTION OR MAYBE TWO- AND THERE

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:25.322
ARE SMALLER START UPS THAT WANT

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.590
TO PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS THAT

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:28.658
FRANKLY. PROVIDE BETTER AND

00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:30.093
FASTER INTERNET ACCESS BUT THEY

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.895
ARE BLOCKED FROM EVEN ENTERING

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:33.196
THE MARKET SO WE NEED TO TALK

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.298
ABOUT AS WELL BUT THIS IS A

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:36.433
GOOD STEP AND I SUPPORT IT.

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:05.996
CONCEPT THEY HAVE NO

CONNECTIVITY. IN LOS ANGELES IS

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:10.700
ONE EXAMPLE HUNDREDS OF

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:12.536
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS HAD NO

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:15.672
CONNECTIVITY. NOT EVEN NUMBER

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.274
OF PRODUCTIVITY THAT YOU SHOULD

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.376

TERMS ARE USED OVER AND OVER

AND OVER AGAIN AND IT GETS TO

00:51:46.937 --> 00:51:48.405
THE POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T MEAN

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:52.342
ANYTHING IT DOESN'T MEAN-ANYTHING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE A

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:55.278

WANT TO STREAMLINE BUT IN SOME

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:17.033
WAYS WE ARE TAKING AWAY THE

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.402
ABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:22.706

HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONE POSING

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.444
THIS MEASURE ON THE BASIS THAT

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.246
I DO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL.

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:38.982
NONE THE LESS- AS THE DOCTOR

NECESSARY THAT WE MOVE FORWARD

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:46.156
CONSIDERING THAT YOU KNOW

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:46.723
THIRTY ONE OTHER STATES ARE

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.725
ALREADY THERE. IT'S TIME THAT

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:51.461
WE ALSO CATCH UP AND DIE IN

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.196
GENERAL WE'VE LEARNED NOT TO

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:55.098
THIS PANDEMIC IT'S BECOME A

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:57.167
NECESSITY IN OUR JOBS IN OUR

00:53:57.233 --> 00:54:00.136
HOMES AND EDUCATION AND THE

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.972
DISPARITY STILL THERE AND SO WE

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:03.273
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.641
INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE. THE

FIVE SIX EIGHT WHICH WOULD

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.006
REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:37.607
PROVIDE REASONABLE. NON

00:54:37.674 --> 00:54:39.876
DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO

POLES AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL POLES.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:44.881
WHAT I MEAN BY NON

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.416
DISCRIMINATORY AS ITS LOCAL

00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:47.350
GOVERNMENTS ALREADY ALLOW

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.785
UTILITIES TO BE ON THESE POLLS

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.620
SO MINE AT THE COMMUNICATIONS

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:51.254
INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN EXTEND

BROADBAND. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.725

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:56.726
THROUGH THE CRACKS DURING

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:57.994

FOR UTILITIES LIKE I SAID

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.267
THERE'S ALSO A SAFE HARBOR IN

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.970
THE BILL WHERE THE- LOCAL.

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.138
GOVERNMENT CAN CHARGE MORE BUT

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.806
THERE'S A SAFE HARBOR OF TWO

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:11.508
HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS PER-

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:12.742
PULL FOR THEM TO MOUNT THAT

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.711
EQUIPMENT. IN THE PAST YEAR

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:16.913
WE'VE SEEN A GREAT NEED. FOR

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.948
ACCESS TO BROADBAND I ALSO WANT

COMMUNITIES IN THE CITIES AND

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:25.121

ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EQUITY ON

00:55:42.939 --> 00:55:44.507
THIS- MEASURE BECAUSE IT'S

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.543
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW. A LOT OF

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.211
US WANT TO SEE EVERYONE IN OUR

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.479
COMMUNITY EVERYONE IN THE STATE

TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERNET

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:55.485
SERVICE. AND IT AND IT'S BEEN A

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.854
CHALLENGE AND I WANT TO SPEAK

00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:59.656
TO A LITTLE BIT WHY AND WHY

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.624
THIS BILL. WOULD MAKE THE

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:04.427
PROCESS BETTER. AND BECAUSE

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.495
I'VE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:06.863
THROUGH OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.531
SIDE OF MY COMMITTEE FOR MANY

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:10.633
YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN PUSHING.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.770
FUNDS THAT HELP. CREATE ACCESS

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.805
TO BUT BY BRINGING BRINGING

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:16.406
MORE ANTENNAS TO COMMUNITIES

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:19.242
ARE NORMALLY. UNDER SERVED SO

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.343
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN YOU

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.978
HAVE A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.813
THAT'S VERY LOW INCOME.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.749
TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN OUR

00:56:25.815 --> 00:56:27.984
COUNTRY ARE PRIVATE WE DON'T

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.686
REALLY HAVE PUBLIC RUN

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:30.920
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ALL THE

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.989
POLLS INFRASTRUCTURE. IS OWNED

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.258
PRIVATELY. AND THEY HAVE

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:37.193
DECIDED WHERE THEY WANT TO

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:40.997
PROVIDE SERVICE- JUST BY THE-

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.966
REGULAR MARKET DEMAND PROCESS.

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:45.235
AND OVER THE YEARS IN

00:56:45.301 --> 00:56:46.536
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE COME IN TO

00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:47.570
TRY TO GET THEM TO GO INTO

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:48.605
AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T WANT TO

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:49.906
GO BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY TO

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:50.774
BE MADE IN FACT THEY MIGHT EVEN

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.709
LOSE MONEY. THEY GO INTO THOSE

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:54.878
AREAS SO WE HAVE. CREATED A

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.946
SYSTEM WHERE WE SUBSIDIZE THE

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.214
PLACEMENT OF ANTENNAS AND

00:56:58.281 --> 00:56:59.816
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE AREAS

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:00.650
SO THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN GET

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.585
ACCESS. EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.888
PAYING THE FULL COST OF THE

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:07.157
SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED.

00:57:07.223 --> 00:57:09.292
UNDER UNDER THIS BILL AND UNDER

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.860
PREVIOUS ACTIONS WE'VE TRIED TO

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:14.397
FIND WAYS TO. DEMOCRATIZE OR

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:15.465
THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE BUT

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:17.801
ALSO MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FOR

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:18.802
PEOPLE LIVING IN UNDERSERVED

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:21.905
AREAS AND TRY TO ENCOURAGE

00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.940
THESE COMPANIES TO GO OUT TO

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:25.842
THOSE AREAS HAS BEEN VERY HARD.

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:27.010
OFTEN TIMES WE HAVE HEARD

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.711
STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE IN CERTAIN

00:57:28.778 --> 00:57:31.314
AREAS NOT HAVING ACCESS. AND

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.550
AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT THEY DO

00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:35.785
HAVE ACCESS BUT THEY JUST

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.954
THEY'RE JUST NOT CONNECTED AND

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:39.389
WE HAVE PROGRAMS TO CONNECT

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:41.825
THOSE PEOPLE IF THEY KNEW THESE

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:44.160
PROGRAMS EXISTED. SO THERE'S A

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:45.695
COMBINATION OF THINGS THAT ARE

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.797
HAPPENING WITH THIS BILL. WE

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.666
WILL TRY TO REGULATE WITH THIS

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:52.035
BUT WE'LL TRY TO REGULAR PRICE-

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:53.803
THE WAY WE DELIVER SERVICE

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.738
AROUND THE STATE. AND I CAN

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.507
GIVE SOME EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.943
IN SOME MARKETS THAT HAVE A LOT

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.411

COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND

00:58:43.086 --> 00:58:44.654
THOSE FUNDS ARE COLLECTED BY

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:47.724
CITIES DO NOT GO TOWARD MAKING.

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.325
THIS UP MORE ACCESSIBLE TO

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:51.194
UNDERSERVED AREAS YET THE STATE

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.650
AMENDMENT SAID HE'S TAKEN I

01:02:00.716 --> 01:02:02.919
THINK IS BILL HAS MOVED IN IN.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.587

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:05.888
REALLY POSITIVE AND I WANT TO

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.423

THAT I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:10.793
BILL TODAY BUT YOU KNOW PART OF

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.328
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.496
THAT THE FCC IN THE FEDERAL

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.997
GOVERNMENT BASICALLY HAVE

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.800
PREEMPTED LOCAL THE STATE FROM

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.402
REGULATING BROADBAND INTERNET

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:22.171
SERVICES AND THOUGH THEY GIVE

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:22.939
US THE PARAMETERS AROUND HOW WE

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:26.175
CAN. HOW WE CAN INTERACT WITH

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.643
THE COMPANIES AND THEIR THEIR

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:28.678
THEORY IS THAT THIS IS AN

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:31.280
ENTERTAINMENT- FORUM AND WHAT

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.782
WE KNOW IS THAT THIS IS NO

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.150
LONGER ENTERTAINMENT THIS IS A

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.586
NECESSITY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.720
TO FUNCTION IN THE STATE OF

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.455
CALIFORNIA IT'S A NECESSITY FOR

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.857
OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.892
AN EDUCATION IT'S A NECESSITY

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.160
FOR US BECAUSE WE WERE SNT

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:47.230
HOME AND WE HAD TO- ZOOM OUR

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.931
MEETINGS FROM HOME AND IT'S A

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.066
NECESSITY FOR A BUSINESS

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.601
COMMUNITY BECAUSE FRANKLY MANY

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:52.368
OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.403
SURVIVED. BUT FOR INTERNET

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.740
OPPORTUNITIES AND SO- IF THIS

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.176
BILL WITHOUT QUESTION IS GOING

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.944
TO TAKE AWAY THE AUTHORITY OF

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:03.446
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE SOME

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.680
DECISIONS AND AS A LOCAL

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:06.048
GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE FOR

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.217
MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS- I'M

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.086
NERVOUS AND I AND IT WORRIES ME

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.187
TO BE TAKING AWAY LOCAL

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.421
GOVERNMENT CONTROL BECAUSE THE

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.789
LAST TIME WE DID IT WE ENDED UP

01:03:13.856 --> 01:03:15.558
I THINK WITH PORTER CABLE

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.094
SERVICE- AND SO IF WE'RE GOING

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.762
TO DO THAT DO THAT I THINK WE

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:20.563
OUGHT TO GET SOMETHING IN

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:23.432
RETURN. AND SO WHAT I THINK WE

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:25.134
HAVE TO GET IN RETURN IS AN

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:28.371
INSURANCE AND ASSURANCE THAT

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.573
THERE WILL BE BROADBAND ACCESS

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.974
TO DISADVANTAGED AND RURAL

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.176

SAN DIEGO ON IN MY COMMUNITY

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:38.214
THIS IS NOT A QUESTION OF

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:40.950
PAYING- A GETTING A DISCOUNT ON

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.151
YOUR INTERNET IT'S NOT A

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:46.155
QUESTION OF BEING ABLE TO- TO

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:46.722
GET THIS SIR. BUT IT'S NOT.

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:47.890
WHAT WANT THERE IS JUST NO

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.793
SERVICE PERIOD. AND SO IF WE'RE

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.261
GOING TO. PROVIDE AN

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:53.963
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PUT THESE

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:56.299
SMALL CELLS AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:57.600
TELL LOCAL GOVERNMENT OKAY

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.768
YOU'VE GOT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:03:58.834 --> 01:04:00.403
TIME TO DETERMINE. WHETHER

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.437
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GO AND

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.872
WHETHER THEY'RE APPROPRIATELY

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.607
PLACED IN THERE. THEN I THINK

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:06.576
WE GOT IT ABSOLUTELY DEMAND

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:07.877
THAT WE START THE KIND OF

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.912
COVERAGE WHICH IS HIGH SPEED.

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:12.381
