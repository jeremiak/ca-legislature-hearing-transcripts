AND OUR GREAT OPPORTUNITY JUST -- TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THE SENATE AND THE OPTION TO SERVE -- IN THE ASSEMBLY IT'S BEEN A TIME FRAME IT'S BEEN. A GREAT EXPERIENCE AND I KNOW WE HAVE MANY NEW SENATORS HERE -- SOME THAT HAVE COME BACK. AND SERVE -- TO BEFORE BUT WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO SERVE IN THE SENATE AND NOTHING AGAINST THE THE LOWER SENATE IS THE PLACE TO SERVE IN MY OPINION -- THE COLLEGIALITY DOES EXIST IT IS REAL. AND I THINK PRO TEN ATKINS -- IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT AND SHE HAS SERVED AND JUST THE OUR GREATEST OF WAYS IN MY IN MY MIND IN TERMS OF BEING FAIR. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE DEBATE THAT OCCURS -- ON THE FLOOR KIND OF STAYS ON THE FLOOR. WE FIGHT OUR FIGHTS AND WE FIGHT THIS FIGHT OF A LOT OF PASSION. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE CAN SHAKE HANDS -- WEEKEND -- DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS FRIENDSHIPS AND SO -- IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE IN DOING THAT. AND I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH. OPERATIVE MACHEN'S IN TERMS OF WHAT SHE WANTS THE FOR HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW CRITICAL THAT IS. THAT IF WE CANNOT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS THAN HOW DO YOU LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM SO -- I WISH YOU THE BEST OF LUCK IN YOUR EFFORTS AND TO THIS BODY -- IN PROVIDING THAT -- IN THOSE CENTER WINNERS ALSO WORKED VERY HARD NOT CAPACITY. AND HE'S NOW I BELIEVE THE CHAIR OF HOUSING LOOKING FORWARD TO GET THINGS I DON'T KNOW IF I SPOKE INCORRECTLY THERE OR NOT BUT I'M SORRY. SO -- I I'M SURE HE'LL CONTINUE IN HIS LEADERSHIP -- POSITION. A AND I JUST -- WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A COUPLE OF OTHER MEMBERS IF I COULD -- SENATOR MINING -- IT WAS A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU -- I BELIEVE I'M TRYING TO THINK BACK HOW LONG WE SERVE TOGETHER BUT IT WAS A LONG. PERIOD IN ALL OF MY TIME HERE IN THE SENATE. AND I KNOW YOU'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES -- WHEN IT RELATES TO DIE BE THIS AND -- SO I APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS AND WAS -- WE WERE ABLE I WAS ABLE TO SUPPORT. YOUR BILL LAST YEAR -- WHEN IT CAME TO FAST FOOD IN A TYPE OF BEVERAGE A CHILD WOULD GET -- KIND OF AS A DEFAULT MEASURE -- WHETHER THAT BE MILK OR WATER. AND THEN LETTING A PARENT MAKE A DECISION ON WHAT THAT BEVERAGE THE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CHILD THAT DIE AFTER THE JAVA SCRIPT TYPE ONE DIABETES AND THE BRIDGE A REAL FRONTAND CENTER. ON THIS ISSUE ALL THAT IS. TO OUR CHILDREN AND THAT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY ARE -- LIVING HEALTHY LIVES -- IT'S BUT ALSO A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH GOVERNOR BROWN. AT ALL THAT WE HAD MANY DISAGREEMENTS WE WERE -- I WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH HIM AND THIS BODY WAS ON SEVERAL FRONTS -- WITH REGARD TO SENATE BILL ONE IN THE WATER. BOND MEASURE AND HOW CRITICAL THAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN RELATED TO HOUSING -- WE HAVE A POPULATION HAS GROWN BY 50%. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WATER STORAGE -- THAT'S A REAL CHALLENGE SO -- MY HAT IS OFF TO THIS BODY TO THE GOVERNOR. AND TO SENATOR NIELSEN REALLY HAVING THAT OFFERED UP ON THE ON THE WATER BOND. ISSUE AND THEN. MAKING SURE THAT ACTUALLY TURNS INTO A REALITY. YES THE US SO -- THAT THAT WAS WONDERFUL ALSO -- ON PENSION REFORM WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM THAT I DON'T THINK IS REALLY RESOLVED -- BUT WE DID MAKE SOME INROADS WITH THE GOVERNOR -- IN THAT ARENA AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT -- THIS BODY AGAIN WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE REAL CONCERN ABOUT THE FISCAL -- THE CONDITION OF THE STATE SPECIALLY IF WE RUN INTO ANOTHER RECESSION. OUT WHAT IS THE IMPACT KENNEDY. AND HOW DO WE BRING PEOPLE UP. TO ASPIRE TO MIDDLE CLASS -- AND STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE IN THE STATE AND THOSE WHO ARE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. HOW WE KEEP THEM THERE AND -- SO WE'VE GOT A DYNAMIC ECONOMY -- I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. ON THE BOTTOM ARE HAVING SUPPER TIME OPPORTUNITY TO RISE UP AND ENJOY -- ALL THE FRUITS THAT I HAVE IN MY LIFE HERE SO -- THANK YOU SO MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE THE CENTER REQUIRE AND TO ALL OF YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- AS A NEW OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THEY HAVE HAD THEIR CHALLENGES AND I WOULD JUST -- TO DISCUSSION THE FUTURE WE'VE GOT A WHOLE NEW BOARD COMING. FORWARD. AND WE NEED TO FLY STRAIGHT. AND WE NEED TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND WE NEED.
