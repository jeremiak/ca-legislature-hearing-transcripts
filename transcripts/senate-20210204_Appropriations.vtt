OF PRIORITIES AND ELIGIBILITY

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.564

THEM THIRTY PLUS YEARS- THERE'S

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:52.504

THOSE TENANTS WHO WILL BUY

00:27:54.105 --> 00:27:55.507
THEIR HOUSES AT LESS THAN

00:27:55.573 --> 00:27:58.009
AFFORDABLE RATE THE STATE WILL

00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:58.977
MAINTAIN AN INTEREST IN THE

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:01.613
EQUITY- SO UNDER THE RIVER TO

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.381
BILL AND UNDER A CALLALOO BILL

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:04.649
THERE'S A WHOLE DEFINITION OF

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:06.885
HOW THAT IS SPLIT. AND SO THE

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.386
STATE CAN BE MADE WHOLE IN

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:10.755

00:28:10.822 --> 00:28:11.923
TENANTS WHO MEET THE INCOME

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.525
ELIGIBILITY CAN BITE AT LESS

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.560
THAN MARKET RATE BUT THE STAFF

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:17.896
AT WHICH TIME IT GETS SOLD THAT

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:20.398
EQUITY PIECE TO BE THE DELTA

00:28:20.465 --> 00:28:21.666
BETWEEN MARKET RATE AND THE

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:23.301
DISCOUNT RATE THE STATE STILL

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:27.906
HAS THAT INTEREST. IN THAT-

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:28.840
BACK FROM A CARE BILL THAT WAS

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.075

BUILT. THE SEVENTIES. ALL OF

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:33.711
THAT IS TO FIND- THE ONLY WAY

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.313
THEY CAN DO THAT IS IF AND

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.315
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CORRECT

FIFTY FIVE YEARS OR SO THAT'S

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:48.760
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

BY THOSE CURRENT TENANT AND IF.

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:49.847
THE GOAL IS TO KEEP FOLKS

HOLLISTER I AM REALLY I'M

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.085
CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVEL

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.587
OPPOSITION TO THOSE FOLKS WHO

00:30:55.653 --> 00:30:57.622
STATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THERE

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.857
FOR TWENTY PLUS IS SOME STATED

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.359
THIRTY TWO YEARS AND THESE

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:02.860
PROPERTIES AND IF THIS IS SUCH

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:04.896
A GREAT IDEA WHY DOES IT NOT

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:07.765
AFFECT ENTIRE CORRIDOR THAT THE

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:09.867
CALTRANS ONLY'S PROPERTIES FOR.

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:12.237
OVER PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS SHOWN

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:16.207
JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND-

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:18.109
JUST HOW ARE THOSE TENANTS

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.411
RIGHT NOW WHO WERE THERE AND-

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:23.514
GOING TO BE PROTECTED AT. I'M

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:25.550
SORRY I THINK I THINK I HEARD

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.452
TWO TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS- THE

00:31:27.518 --> 00:31:30.321
CURRENT TENANTS. TO RENO. BUT

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:33.558
THE CONDITIONS AND THE ON THE

00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:37.028
NEEDS I THINK ARE PARTICULARLY

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.063
DIFFERENT IN THE L. SERENO AREA

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.232
FROM PASADENA AND SOUTH

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:44.402
PASADENA ALSO. WELL FOR SINGLE

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.605
FAMILY RESIDENCE MORE HISTORIC

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.474
THORTON IS HIS STORY HOMES

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.276
THERE'S A LOT LESS OF

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:54.145
PROPERTIES IT'S JUST TO ADDRESS

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:56.714
THE ISSUES IN THE REST OF THE

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:58.249
CORRIDOR PASADENA SOUTH

00:31:58.316 --> 00:31:59.517
PASADENA IS QUITE DIFFERENT

00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.486
FROM. THE WAY THE WHOLE THE

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:03.688
HOUSING IN THE OTHER IN EL

00:32:03.755 --> 00:32:05.590
SERENO AND ALLEY CITY PARK SO

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.492
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST IF

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:10.161
WE- ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT THE

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:12.930
NEEDS HAVE BEEN. A LOT MORE ON

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:15.533
OCCUPIED A LOT MORE HOT HOUSING

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.236
THAT NEEDS WORK- AND SO ALL

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:19.237
THOSE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAT

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:21.239
IS TO THINK THIS IS BETTER TO

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.174
FOCUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.543
MAJOR ISSUES HAVE BEEN IS IN

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.411
THE EL SERENO PART OF THE

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:28.112
CORRIDOR. WE REALLY WANT TO

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.448
FOCUS IN TWO MOVIES PROPERTIES

00:32:30.515 --> 00:32:33.551
FORWARD AND THERE AGAIN- THE

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:36.487
CHAIRS AS REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:38.589
THAT AREA. KNOWS THAT THERE ARE

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:41.292
DISTINCTIONS THAT WE WANT TO

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:42.427
MAKE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.996
MOE FORWARD WITH AFFORDABILITY

00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:46.764
AND ALSO SELLING IT TO THE

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:48.499
CURRENT TENANTS SO THE CURRENT

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.668
TENANTS WILL BE ABLE TO BUY IF

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:52.170
THEY WANT IF THEY DON'T WANT.

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.072
YOU'LL STAY THERE NOT GOING TO

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.474
BE EVICTED ON YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.943
INCOME LEVELS ARE THAT HAVE TO

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.546
BE MET OF FOR AFFORDABILITY I

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:04.048
THINK IT WAS YOU- CENTER

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.651
PORTANTINO THAT. MAKE SURE THAT

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:07.885
WE HAD THE AFFORDABLE RENTERS

THE LONG STANDING TENANTS SO

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.035
JUST BECAUSE THIS BILLS

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.704
SPECIFIC EL SERENO DOESN'T MEAN

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:00.838
THAT THE OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:02.507
DISTRICT AREN'T GOVERNED BY

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:04.208
PRIOR LEGISLATION INDISPOSITION

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.511
AND CALTRANS. THOUGH NOT MOVING

AS FAST AS ANYBODY WOULD LIKE

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:10.281
IS SELLING THOSE HOMES

ACCORDING TO THAT- PRIOR

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:15.953
LEGISLATION. AND SO- THAT THAT

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.688
I MEAN THAT'S JUST FACTUAL IN

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:20.258
IN HOW YOU KNOW IT'S BEING DONE

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.259

THOSE TENANTS IF THEY'RE IN THE

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:30.735
FORM OF A HOUSING PROGRAM AS

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:32.403
WELL AS THE STATE'S. INTEREST

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.071
IN THOSE PROJECTS BUT WOOD

00:34:34.138 --> 00:34:35.506
MISTER ROGERS DOING IN HER

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.074
SECOND. SECTION IS TWEAKING

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:38.743
THAT SLIGHTLY IN RELATION TO

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.078
THE TO THE NON PROFITS THAT'S

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.513
THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT BETWEEN

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.382
THE REST OF THE DISTRICT. AND

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:49.787
THE EL SERENO PEACE AND SO.

THAT THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.122
MAJOR DIFFERENCE. BUT THE OTHER

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.023
STILL IS GOVERNED ALL OF THE-

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:53.491

AND THEN WORKED WEEK PROBABLY

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.532
SIX TIMES SINCE THEN THE OTHER

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.033
THING THAT'S GOING ON IS

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.001
CALTRANS. I BELIEVE WE'RE STILL

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:04.936
WAITING FOR THE OVERALL

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.270
REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.105
SUPPOSEDTO DRAFT BASED ON THAT

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:10.508
LEGISLATION AND SO. THAT'S PART

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:13.511
OF WHAT. THE AMOUNT OF MY

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:14.846
DISTRICT WANTS TO SEE WHAT

00:35:14.912 --> 00:35:17.248
THOSE REGULATIONS ARE BEFORE WE

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:19.417
GO DOWN CHANGING ANY OF THE

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.585
PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IN

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:22.320
PLACE SINCE THE LATE SEVENTIES

00:35:22.386 --> 00:35:23.754
AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.656
