I THANK YOU FOR THE TIME- I HAVE. REVIEWED YOUR QUESTIONS I AM PREPARED TO ANSWER THOSE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PROVIDE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL POINTS OF INFORMATION FOR. BOTH BRINGING YOU UP TO THE MOMENT AND- WHY C. R. AND- IN WITH CONTACTS FOR OUR COUNTY PLAN REVIEWS- I SEE ARE IS WORKING WITH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE AGENCY AND WORK GROUPS ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THE NEDS OF YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE BEING CONSIDERED AN INITIATIVE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS THIS INCLUDES ALL THE WORK AROUND CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITHIN OUR OWN HEALTH AGENCY. SUCH AS THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AS WELL AS WORK IN THE CORRECTIONAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE COUNCIL ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OR BOARD SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD OR QUEZON WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO MEET WITH STAKEHOLDERS OF ALL PERSPECTIVES. WE HAVE RECONVENES THE CHILD WELFARE A Y. C. R. COMMITTEE. SO FAR WE HAVE HAD ONE MEETING IT WAS VERY PRODUCTIVE AND WE ARE PLANNING ANOTHER MEETING NEXT WEEK. WE ARE MEETING REGULARLY WITH YOUTH JUSTICE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS COUNTY PROBATION. OFFICERS WE ARE ALSO WITH COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND OTHER EXPERTS- I SEE ARE HAS AN OPEN DOOR POLICY. WE ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN SITE VISITS TO THE LOCAL FACILITIES AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH STAFF. USING BECAUSE CITY AND REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS. A BIT OF BACKGROUND ON COUNTY REVIEW PROCESS ALL COUNTIES. SUBMITTED THEIR PLANS TIMELY O. Y. C. R. AND THE HHS STAFF REVIEWED. COUNTY PLANT MULTIPLE TIMES. PURPOSE AND PLAN ABOUT YOU PROCESS WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE CARRYING OUT OUR STATUTORY MANDATE AND ENSURING THAT ALL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR PROVIDED IN ANY PLANS. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED AREAS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING. FOR FURTHER BUILDING OUT FUTURE PLANS WE WERE SEE THIS AN ITERATIVE. AS YOU RECALL WHEN THE PLANS WERE DUE O. Y. C. R. WAS NOT YET- I WASN'T HERE YET AND ONCE WE LOOKED AT THE- THAT'S YOU WE WERE ABLE TO CLARIFY FOR COUNTIES A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WERE. I AND MY STAFF NOT DIRECTLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH COUNTY THIS FIFTY SEVEN CHIEFS OF PROBATION AND ONE DEPUTY CHIEF. WE AGENDA EYES AT THIRTY MINUTES YOU MEETING WITH EACH OF THE COUNTIES. IN THEIR TEENS AND WE GAINED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND CONTEXT ABOUT THE COUNTY AND THEIR PLANS WE ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND WE DISCUSSED. OF REVISIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND OFFERS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THEN OUR COUNCIL LISA HEARTS PROVIDED A SUMMARY OF THE REQUEST FOR SUPPLEMENTATION AND ASK FOR THAT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. WE ARE I'M GETTING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION BACK TO US TIMELY. COMMON REQUESTS FOR REVISIONS WERE UPDATES ON FULL TARGET POPULATION INCLUDING NOT ONLY YOU'VE CURRENTLY IN DJJ BUT ALL YOUTH WAS SERIOUS OFFENSES WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO DJJ THIS WAS CRITICAL TO ESTABLISH BASELINE DATA SO THAT WE COULD MONITOR WHETHER COUNTIES ARE EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF USERS WHO ARE BEING SENT TO A LONG TERM COMMITMENTS. IN THE SECURE TRAFFIC AND TO PREVENT WHAT WE CALL NET WIDE NEED ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO CARE FOR YOU FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME WAS ALSO A- AN AREA FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND DEEP DISCUSSION ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON HOW COUNTIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A SECURE TRACK. WILL SUPPORT YOU IN FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND RE ENTRY WHEN THEY HAVE SENT THEIR USED TO REGIONAL FACILITIES THOSE WERE THREE AREAS OF COMMON SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REQUESTS. COMMON AREAS WHERE WE WILL BE OFFERING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ARE THOSE IN DATA AND THE MEASUREMENT OF- MILESTONES AND OUTCOMES FOR THE YOU. CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING CONNECTIONS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY IN COUNTIES WHERE THERE IS A SCARCITY OF CBO'S. THE END THERAPEUTIC FACILITY DESIGN WAS ALSO A POINT OF DISCUSSION AND REQUEST. FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE INTEND TO WORK WITH COUNTIES AND ADDRESS THESE- AREAS OF NEED BY IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES OFFERING TRAININGS AND OFFERING DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTIES WHAT R. O. Y. C. R. STAFF. WE WILL OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BOTH THAT WE SEE THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- AND WHERE WE ARE ARE ACTUALLY DIRECTLY ASKED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THAT THAT WILL BE DONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WERE DEVELOPING THOSE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND IN THE PROCESS OF- BRINGING ON OTHER- ORGANISING INTERNAL SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND THEN HIRE CONSULTANTS WHERE NECESSARY WE WILL HAVE A COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT WHICH IS ALMOST FULLY HIRED WE'RE GOING TO BE A- TEAM OF TEN VERY SOON. I WILL THEN THAT THEY WILL BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- ARE YOU IN MAY OUR REGIONAL THEY STAFF WILL BE IN PLACE AND THEY'LL BE ON THE GROUND AND ABLE TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH COUNTIES AND LOCAL STATE. COLDER'S WITH REGARD TO THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE WERE DEVELOPING THE DATA RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXPERTISE IN HOUSE AND WE ALSO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH UCLA CLINICAL EXPERTS. FOR YOU HEALTH IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND HOW TO PROMOTE HEALTHY ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT WE- CONTRACTED WITH DOCTORS ELIZABETH BARNARD. DR ERICA BATH AND DR LAURA ABRAMS. WIRE I SEE- IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING CONSULTANTS WITH EXPERTISE IN CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS THERAPEUTIC FACILITIES AND EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. THERE HAVE BEEN- I SEE- FROM YOUR QUESTION CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT SMALLER COUNTIES AND ACCOMMODATING OUR YEARS OUR INITIAL MEETINGS WITH COUNTIES HAVE ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY STRENGTHS AND CHALLENGES- SMALLER COUNTIES SMALLER COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE TEND TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED CARE AND ENGAGEMENT FOR YOU. AND CAN BE QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING YOU OUT OF THE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SOME SMALL COUNTIES INDICATED IN THEIR PLANTS IN IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE CERTAIN RESOURCES NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE THE EASIER FOR INSTANCE THEY'LL MAY LACK TREATMENT STAFF SUCH AS. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST WITHIN THEIR COUNTIES OR FAMILIES WILL HAVE TO DRAW MULTIPLE HOURS TO ACCESS RESOURCES THIS ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO OFFER CERTAIN TYPES OF PROGRAMMING. ADDITIONALLY SOME COUNTIES HAVE A SEVERE SCARCITY OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FINALLY SOME COUNTIES DON'T HAVE JUVENILE FACILITIES. OR THEY DO NOT HAVE A FACILITY THAT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE LONG TERM- STAYS AND SO WE ARE- APPROACHING THESE- THESE- ISSUES. BY LOOKING AT SOME REGIONAL APPROACHES COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE FACILITIES AT ALL OR FACILITIES THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. REPORTED TO US THAT THEY ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED AND TO USE WITH OTHER COUNTIES TO CARE FOR THEIR USE AND REGIONAL FACILITIES. THIS IS BEING DONE EITHER THROUGH PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES OR THROUGH A COORDINATION. OF BY THE COORDINATION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CHIEF. PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT THE LEADERSHIP THAT WAS PROVIDED BY C. POCK DEVELOPED WHAT'S CALLED A- CONSORTIUM WHICH IS A MEMBERSHIP SERVICE TO ALLOW COUNTIES TO COLLABORATE AND SHARE RESOURCES THAT THEY MIGHT LACK. SUCH AS HELPING COUNTIES FIND PLACEMENT FOR SECURE TRUCK YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ALMOST ALL THE COUNTIES HAVE JOINED EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE. HOW IS- YC ARE HELPING COUNTIES BUILD THESE REGIONAL CONNECTIONS OURSELVES ARE COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT WHICH WE ARE CLOSE TO HAVING FULLY STAFFED AS INDICATED IS BASED IN A REGIONAL MODEL AND WE WILL B WORKING TO HELP DEVELOP THE CONNECTIONS ACROSS COUNTIES. AND WITHIN REGIONS BASED ON THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS NOW THAT EACH COUNTY HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REAL LINES YEARS NO MATTER THEIR SIZE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES REGIONALLY TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES. RESOURCES BUILD RELATIONSHIPS IDENTIFY FUNDING NEEDS AND ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS BUILDING THEIR CAPACITY CONNECTING CDOS ACROSS COUNTY LINES. ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS INCLUDING THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY WHERE APPROPRIATE. WHERE TREATMENT OR SERVICES ARE NOT LOCALLY AVAILABLE AND OTHER CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS UP. EARLIER AND THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH THE COUNTIES. THE COUNTIES AS INDICATED- ALL REVISIONS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED REVISIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SUBMITTED BACK TO US AS I INDICATED THERE IS A THIRTY DAY WINDOW THAT WAS- REQUESTED. THERE HAS BEEN A COUPLE OF REQUESTS FOR EXTENSIONS THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE IN BY THE END OF MAY- ONCE THE PLANS ARE APPROVED WE WILL POST THEM ON OUR WEB. WEBSITE ALONG WITH AN OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY BY MYSELF AND MY TEAM. WE ARE STARTING THE SITE VISITS AS INDICATED IN MAY AS WELL. THE FIFTH QUESTION IS DO THE COUNTY PLANS REFLECT NEW MODELS OF CARE FOR LONGER TERM PLACEMENTS OR ARE THE COUNTIES PRIMARILY FOCUSING ON YEARS. OF FOCUSING ON HOUSING IS IN THE JUVENILE HALLS THE FACILITIES THAT EXIST TODAY IN THE COUNTIES TO HOUSE YOU HAVE BEEN RELYING PURSUANT TO SB EIGHTY THREE ARE LARGELY THE JUVENILE HALLS. WE HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS THIRTY EIGHT YEARS IN THE SECURE TRACK FACILITIES TODAY WHO ARE LIVING IN THOSE- SECURE TRACK YOU- FACILITIES HOWEVER THE COUNTIES ARE HUGELY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THESE KIDS WILL HAVE COMMITMENTS FROM THE JUDGE OF ANYWHERE. FROM ONE YEAR TO SEVEN YEARS AS THE COMMITMENT MATRIX CURRENTLY IS WRITTEN TODAY AND THAT IS BEING- LOOKED OUT AGAIN AND AMENDED ON A TEAM OF FOLKS WHICH I AM PART OF THROUGH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SOME COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF. WORK TO CREATE A HOME LIKE SETTING IN THESE LOCATIONS AND TO CREATE AN EXPANSE BASES THAT ARE THERAPEUTICALLY DESIGNS LARGER ROOMS FOR RECREATION SCHOOL AND FAMILY VISITS AND OUTDOOR SPACES SOME OF THE COUNTIES ARE ASKING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING FACILITIES. TO BE TRAUMA INFORMED THERAPEUTIC IN NATURE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES ARE REFLECTED IN THE COUNTY PLANS SOME HIGHLIGHT PARTICULAR MODIFICATION PROJECTS THAT THEY CAN CARRY OUT WITH AVAILABLE FUNDS SUCH AS EXPANDING OUTDOOR SPACE OR SOFTENING THE FEEL OF THE FACILITY. OTHERS ARE MORE AMBITIOUS IN THEIR EXPRESSION OF TRANSFORMATION OF SPACE AS INDICATED THERE ARE ALREADY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT YEARS IN THE SECURE TRACK PLACEMENTS IN COUNTIES AND COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THAT THEY NEED TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CARING FOR THESE YOU. IMMEDIATELY AS OF JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THEN AFTER THE CLOSURE OF DJJ AND THE RETURN OF YOUR TO THE COUNTIES IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. OVERALL COUNTIES DEMONSTRATE A KNOWLEDGE OF THE AVERAGE LENGTH. OF STAY OF THE KIDS FOR THE SIR AND CRIMES. AND THEY CONSIDERED THE NEED. AND THAT THE U. WEALTHIEST IN THIS TRACK FACILITIES FOR APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES THAT WORK THAT THEY ANALYZE FOR THEIR PARTICULAR COUNTIES. AND THEY HAVE PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS FOR THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR THE YEARS. THAT INCLUDES STEP DOWN FROM THE SECURE FACILITIES TO LESS SECURE FACILITIES TO COMMUNITY THROUGH FURLOUGHS TO FAMILY EVENTS COMMUNITY STEPPED DOWN LOCATIONS AND OTHER PRIVILEGES. EVERY OPTION IS BEING EXPLORED AND MODELS FOR CHANGE ARE DESIRED BY THE COUNTIES AND- WHY C. R. IS PREPARED TO IDENTIFY THOSE MODELS AND PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NECESSARY. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF HAVING YOU STAY FOR THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE MOST RESTRICTIVE SET SETTINGS. THERE ARE SOME OF THE COUNTIES TO HAVE CAMPS AND RANCHES WHICH THEY ARE VERY COMMITTED. TO RAINY REIMAGINING AND REMODELING FOR THIS POPULATION AT AT- IT BOTH THEY HAVE THOSE PLANS AND THEY ARE. EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO ROLL OUT THOSE PLANS AS TIME AND FUNDS AND RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. COUNTIES ALSO THE KNOWLEDGE THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE IS STAYING FOR LONGER TERMS IN THERE- IT IN THEIR DESIRE FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ALLOW YOU TO LIVE COMFORTABLY AND CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILIES. WHILE THEY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TREATMENT WE SAW THINGS LIKE KITCHENETTES WHERE YOU CAN MAKE THEIR OWN SNACKS AFTER SCHOOL FAMILY ROOMS FOR YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER. PLAYGROUNDS FOR CHILDREN OF THE USE AND OR THEIR SIBLINGS LIBRARIES GARDENS RECREATIONAL AREAS THAT ARE WELL STOCKED AND PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES TO YOU. AS WELL AS THE HOME LIKE FURNISHINGS IMPROVE PLANNING VOCATIONAL CENTRES AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY MAY BE RIVER RAISING. A YEAR A CHILD. FROM AS EARLY AS AGE FOURTEEN TO PERHAPS AGE NINETEEN OR TWENTY DEPENDING ON THAT COMMITMENT BY THE JUDICIAL OFFICER. THROUGH THE LAST FORMATIVE YEARS OF THIS CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND THESE MODIFICATIONS CAN MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THE YEARS EXPERIENCE. CERTAIN COUNTIES ARE CONSIDERING NEW PROGRAMMING MODELS OF CARE AND NEW APPROACHES TO IN CUSTODY AND INGENUITY PROGRAMMING- I SEE OURS IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND BRINGING ON EXPERTS IN REHABILITATIVE FACILITY MODELS. WITH THEIR HELP- C. R. O. Y. C. R. WILL BE IN A GOOD POSITION TO HELP COUNTIES IDENTIFY. NEW EFFECTIVE MODELS AND ENHANCE OUR ABILITY% TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THIS CRITICAL AREA TO ENSURE THAT THE SECURITY YOU FACILITIES PLAY A- THERAPEUTIC ROLE WITHIN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THAT THESE CAR INVOLVED YOU WILL EXPERIENCE AND AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH OUR DESIRE TO HAVE ARE YOU STATE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME IN THESE- FACILITIES AND I BELIEVE. THAT'S ALSO THE DESIRE OF YOUR CALORIES. THERE ARE ALSO A LOT QUESTION HERE ABOUT HOW WILL- WHY ARE ENVIOUS YOU SEE COLLABORATE TO REVIEW THE JUVENILE FACILITY GROUNDS PROPOSED FOR FUNDING IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. WE ARE IN CLOSE COLLABORATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT BEING A CZ WE HAVE A STANDING MEETING- AT WHICH IS FREQUENTS- I BELIEVE IT IT DIDN'T GET SET AT LEAST BI WEEKLY IF NOT MORE- AND WE NEED MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY. WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO CONCUR ON JUVENILE GRANTS AND ALSO ON REGULATION PROVISIONS FOR THE JUVENILE FACILITIES. WE HAVE MET WITH THE SEC'S JUVENILE JUSTICE STANDING COMMITTEE WHICH APPROVES JUVENILE GROUNDS AND I WILL BE ATTENDING THEIR NEXT MEETING TO FURTHER DISCUSS. ARTISTS ARE PARTICIPATION IN A CONCURRING AND THE GRANTS I'M ON THE EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE REGULATION REVISION. WE AND THE VLCC HAVE DISCUSSED AN APPROACH TO POSSIBLE JUVENILE FACILITY GRANTS. WITHOUT KNOWING MORE OF THE DETAILS IN THE FINAL PROPOSAL IT IS HARD TO BE TOO SPECIFIC BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGES. AND WE TAKE OUR OBLIGATION TO CONCUR WHICH WE BELIEVE MEANS TO ENGAGE AND AGREE VERY SERIOUSLY. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A MEETING OF THE MINDS WITH THE SEC ABOUT THAT APPROACH. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. YOU THINK YOU VERY MUCH DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANY COMMENT. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN A HAN NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT THAT. GOOD MORNING HISPANIC ANYTHING FROM THE L. A. O. SENATOR EDMUND NOTE NO COMMENTS FROM THE L. A. O. THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I AM I AM REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE PROGRESS IS THAT THAT IS BEING MADE. WITH THIS DIRECTOR OF THE CERRO I CERTAINLY HEARD FROM A LOT OF- COUNTIES EARLY ON THAT THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY OR THE RESOURCES OR THE- STAFFING- BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE- IT THROUGHOUT THE FACILITIES- SO TWO QUESTIONS ONE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE REALIGNMENT AND FUNDS IS HAS THERE BEEN CORRECTION FROM. SOME OF THE PAST INEQUITIES OF REALIGNMENTS OR OR WE STILL FINDING LIKE THE COUNTIES ON ON INLAND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUNDING THAN THE COUNTIES- IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IS THAT IS THAT REMAIN A CONSISTENT ISSUE AROUND THIS AREA AS WELL. WHAT WE DID HERE THE HOUSE- AND WE ARE- BUILT INTO THE LEGISLATION IS A REVIEW OF THE FORMULA BY THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE TAKING NOTE OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING BECAUSE I THINK JUST BY VIRTUE OF. DEVELOPING A FORMULA THAT THEY THERE ARE THOSE THAT DON'T. FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AS AS OTHERS COMING FROM THE STATE SO WE ARE TAKING NOTE. AND OUR GOAL IS TO AMELIORATE THOSE DISCREPANCIES AT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN OUR NEXT ITERATION AND HOW THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT. OKAY THAT THAT THAT IS REASSURING- INC. AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE REQUESTING THAT PROPOSED A HUNDRED MILLION TO YOU YOUR AGENCY WILL BE DELIVERING THE GRANTS. YOURSELF SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANOTHER AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING FOR IT'LL JUST BE FROM YOUR DEPARTMENT. TO DECIDE WHAT WATCH GRANTS GET FUNDED WHICH FACILITIES ARE WORKED ON IS THAT CORRECT WHICH PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED. I BELIEVE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE WILL BE PARTNERING WITH- THE SEC AND I KNOW THAT. KATIE HOWARD IS HERE- AND THOSE ARE EXACTLY THAT THE DETAILS THAT WERE GOING TO BE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO. TO IRONED OUT SO THAT IT'S AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. WITH THE ACCOUNTABILITY NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTIES- ARE HAVE A SEAMLESS PROCESS IN APPLYING FOR THE GRANTS. THIS HOW DID YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SENATOR EGGMAN- GOOD TO BE HERE AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR ZERO THAT WAS A VERY VERY HELPFUL BRIEFING- YES THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR JUVENILE FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH DJJ REALIGNMENT IS IN THE BSE SEEN BUDGET I SHOULD MENTION I'M THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE B. S. D. C. SO JUST TO ADD ON. TO WHAT DIRECTOR ZERO HAS ALREADY OUTLINED- WE'RE IN ACTIVE CONSULTATION WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING A Y. C. R. AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY GET THAT ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT TO THE COUNTIES I THINK THERE'S A CLEAR RECOGNITION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE ARE SOME URGENT. INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED PROMPTLY AND AS DIRECTOR OF THE CERRO- HAS ALREADY OUTLINED WE ARE IN REGULAR COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION SO IT IS AN AS YET A WORK IN PROGRESS WE DON'T HAVE A FINAL- GRANTED PLAN AT THIS MOMENT BUT WILL BE VERY HAPPY T SHARE THOSE. DETAILS AS SOON AS THEY'RE AVAILABLE. DO YOU KNOW STATEWIDE THEN HOW MANY HOW MANY USERS ARE STILL BEING HELD AND IN SOME KIND OF A HAPHAZARD UNCERTAIN- AREA IF YOU WILL. WELL I THINK THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF APPROACHES BEING TAKEN BY THE COUNTY'S AND AS DIRECTOR ZERO I SPOKE ABOUT THERE ARE. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PLUS YOUTH WHO HAVE ALREADY MOVED INTO- COUNTY- SUPERVISION WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE J. J. AND AS CASES ARE MOVING THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM- I PERSONALLY VISITED FRESNO COUNTY ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AGO AND SAW THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE THERE TO MAKE SOME FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS FOR. ON THE SIX SECURING A TRACK YOU THROUGH OUR HOUSE FAIR- WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM EVERY COUNTY THAT HAS- BEGUN OPERATING A SECURE YOU'VE TRACKED THE SOLIDITY- A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT IS THEY'RE DOING AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU SENATOR- I THINK THE COUNTIES HAVE COME UP TO SPEED JUST AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN- TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF THE NEW POPULATION AND THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO BE MADE WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS DIRECTOR OF THE CERATOPSIANS REST THINGS LIKE IMPROVED OUTDOOR SPACE AND RECREATIONAL SPACE PROGRAMMING TREATMENT. TRAUMA INFORMED AND SO ON- SO I THINK MY BEST ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR IS THAT COUNTIES HAVE DONE THE BEST THEY CAN UP TO THIS POINT AND ARE EAGER TO MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS YEAH I WOULD AGREE WITH THE EAGER I PIPE CERTAINLY HEARD SOME FROM MIND OF- OF NOT HAVING THE APPROPRIATE FACILITIES FOR YOUTH. UP AND THEN I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION ON THIS FOR- TALKED AND TURN OVER DR PAN AND AGAIN THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE TASK THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON AN- IMPORTANT BUT BUT INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND WE HAVE KIDS LIVES. AND SYSTEMS THAT ARE CHARGED. TRYING TO- YOU KNOW I'M HAVE A HAVE MY ARMS OUT TRYING TO CATCH THESE AS THE AS ARE COMING. I KNOW WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE AND I VISITS FOR SOME OF THE JUVENILE FACILITIES AND SAW. MANY OF MY FORMER STUDENTS SOCIAL WORKERS WORKING- IN THE DJJ ARENA WILL WE BE ABLE DO YOU THINK. IT HAS THERE BEEN ATTEMPTED TO HAVE ANY DATA ON BEING ABLE TO- AND THEY HAVE SOME OF THOSE WORKERS AND MOVE INTO THE COUNTIES. WHERE THEIR FACILITIES WERE LOCATED. SO WE DON'T LOSE THE EXPERTISE OF PEOPLE TO AVOID ARE EVEN WORKING WITH THESE THIS POPULATION. I WOULD DEFER RISKY FOR DIRECTOR OF THE SERRANO SHE'S DONE A LOT MORE CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY PLANTS OKAY- WELL WITH REGARD TO HAVING THIS THE WORKERS WITH EXPERTISE FROM DJJ MOVED INTO THE COUNTIES I WOULD. DEFER TO- DOCTOR BOLTS CALL. THE DOUBLES GOOD MORNING SOCIAL WORKERS YES IT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE WORKERS IN AND WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE SHORTAGE OF SOME MARIJUANA SOME TO SLIP AWAY. SO- BUT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK YOUR OUR OWN PROCESSES WE GO THROUGH THE CLOSURE AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH MANY PARTNERS HOW H. R. ON WHAT THE PROCESS LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF SHUTTING DOWN OUR OUR OUR FACILITIES AND BEING WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM- THERE'S LOTS CONVERSATIONS OF HOW THAT WORKS FOR OUR STAFF THAT BEING SAID ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH HIM WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR STAFF ARE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE IN THE COUNTIES WERE ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH DIRECTOR WAS STERILE. IT'S BEEN GREAT TED DEVELOP A PARTNERSHIP WITH HER AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERSHIP IS THE POP ON INFORMATION SHARING BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH INDIVIDUALS PROVIDE INSIGHTS THAT FOCUS- HAVE QUESTIONS AROUND SOME OF THE PROCEDURES POLICIES THAT DJJ HAS DONE. OKAY THANK YOU THE DOCUMENT. THANK YOU AND- REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION THE WORK BEING PUT IN I GUESS AT THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD SO- AND I KNOW THAT WHEN THE CHALLENGES YOU PRESENTED IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY ARE SMALLER COUNTIES IN RURAL COUNTIES- IS A LACK OF STAFF ALSO I THINK YOU KNOW DISTANCE IS AN ISSUE OR GEOGRAPHY- BECAUSE FOR THE PROGRAM IS TO TRY TO BRING THESE EVEN OUT CLOSER TO HOME RIGHT SO THAT THERE AND- SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THAT SUPPORTS BUT- WHEN YOU'RE DISPERSED GEOGRAPHICALLY. THAT'S CHALLENGING AS WELL COMBINED WITH THE SAID LACK OF STAFF- IT'S ADDRESS- IT AND THEN CERTAINLY IT CAN STAND YOU DOING SOME OF THESE REGIONAL CENTERS AS WELL BUT THAT. A SO ARE. WHAT KIND OF PROTEGER TAKING THAT TO TRY TO CRACK THAT NOT GREAT BECAUSE IN SOME SENSES CREATING A REGIONAL APPROACH IS NOW MAKES SENSE BECAUSE- I TRY TO PULL RESOURCES BUT ALSO. YOU'RE FIGHTING AGAINST THE GEOGRAPHY SO HOW DO YOU KEEP THE YOU SO HI. WHAT'S ON THE THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THE PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER RURAL COUNTIES IN TERMS OF. TRYING TO KEEP. THE SKIP CLOSER TO THEIR HOMES RIGHT- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YEAH AND YET THE SAME TIME- THEY'LL BE SURE YOU CAN PUT THE RESOURCES TOGETHER TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND OF COURSE THEY THEY MIGHT YOU KNOW THEIR HOMES MIGHT BE DISPERSED ACROSS A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA DEPENDING ON THE KIDS AND SO FORTH. SO- I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WHAT KIND OF PURCHASED- YOU'RE FIGURING OUT ON THAT WITH THE COUNTIES. WELL I THINK THAT LIKE YOU SAID THAT'S KIND OF THE GORDIAN KNOT THAT WE HAVE TO UNRAVEL AND- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THAT. THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TREATMENT WITH TELE THREE MEN TELEHEALTH. OUR LOOKING AT WHAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES MIGHT NEED- WE'RE LOOKING AGAIN AT MAKING SURE THAT THEY COUNTIES- ARE ARRANGING FOR FREQUENT FAMILY CONTACT WE HAVE ONE COUNTY THAT. IS PAYING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND I BELIEVE CELL PHONES- AND EVEN MAYBE A HOUSING VOUCHER FOR STAYING THE NIGHT IN A HOTEL SO THAT THE YOUTH CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT FAMILY ENGAGEMENT COMPONENT AS WELL AS THAT- THE KIND OF. VIDEO VISITS THAT WE SAW REALLY EMERGED THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I'M WITH WITH REGARD AGAIN TO THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW BE- REALLY REACHING OUT TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH- AND- CBO'S AND AT I AM IN TOUCH WITH THE COUNCIL OF NONPROFITS WE HAVE A GREAT INTEREST FROM PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THAT WANT THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO WE'RE GONNA JUST BE PUTTING OUR MINDS TOGETHER AND EVEN IF IT HASN'T EXISTED YET WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BUILDING- A SYSTEM RESPONSE THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF AND THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT SINCE WE KNOW IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THE YOUTH TO PASS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. THAT THEY HAVE THAT FAMILY ENGAGEMENT EVEN IF THEY CAN'T BE DIRECTLY IN THE COMMUNITY LIKE WE'RE HOPING I THINK WE HAVE THIRTY THREE FACILITIES I BELIEVE I COUNTED THAT TWENTY TWO COUNTIES DON'T HAVE FACILITIES. SO THAT WE ARE GETTING THAT REGIONAL COUNTY LAYS ON PERSON HIRED BY MY STAFF THAT WILL BE ASSIGNED A REGION OF COUNTIES AND THEIR WHOLE GOAL WILL TO THE WILL BE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SENATOR IT WILL BE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING. WHATEVER WE CAN HAPPEN HAPPENED WHETHER IT'S TECH. WHETHER IT'S NOT A- THE ABILITY FOR CEO FROM ONE COUNTY TO THE NEXT COUNTY WHERE IT'S HIRING LIVED EXPERIENCE YOU. SAID YOU KNOW TO COACH AND TO. TO BE WITH YOU AS THEY GO ON FURLOUGHS I DON'T KNOW I'M YES GUYS REALLY THE LIMIT HERE WORK WERE BUILDING IT AND MORE. WORK WERE USING ALL OF OUR IMAGINATION OR ASKING FOR INPUT FROM OUR LIVED EXPERIENCE- FOLKS SO- I DON'T HAVE EXACT ANSWERS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WERE ON IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME I THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SPECIALIZED. EXPERT IN A Y. C. R. THAT SPECIALIZES IN RURAL COUNTIES AND EVEN SOME CRAP- OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE FIFTY CARE LIES TO THE RURAL COUNTIES. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR COUNTIES FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT THEIR KIDS ARE SUCCESSFUL. IT REALLY APPRECIATE AN ANSWER BECAUSE- SOMETIMES THERE'S A LOT OF LIKE WELL. WE THIS THE USUALLY WE DO IT NO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE BUT THE- ALLOWING US TO THINK OUT OF BOX THINK ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES OTHER TYPE OF THING I MEAN IT'S NOT GONNA BE PURELY TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION EITHER- BUT- NO TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP TRY TO CLOSE THE G. GOT GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE. THINKING THE- THINGS. RIGHT- YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU MOVE THE FAMILIES OVER SO THEY CAN SEE THAT BUT MAYBE I REALIZE THE YOU THERE ARE CERTAIN SITUATION BUT AS TO WHAT THE MOVE THE YOUTH OVER AND STILL KEEP THEM AND YOU KNOW THAT. A SECURITY ADDRESS. I THINK ANYBODY BUILDING OUT THE TEAM CELLS ARE CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO BE INNOVATIVE. AND THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO NOT JUST. SAY WELL WE'LL TAKE THE EXISTING MODEL AND MAYBE DO A FEW TWEAKS THAT TO SAY NOT WELL ACTUALLY LET'S STEP BACK AND- AND REALLY LOOK AT THIS. AND IS THIS A DIFFERENT WAY WE CAN DO THINGS. KNOWING THAT ARE WHAT WHAT REALLY WANT TO DO IS. YOU KNOW RECONNECT THE USE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE- THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T THEM RETURNING BACK TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE WANT AND- WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO. TO THEN BE ABLE LIVE FULL LIVES AND CONTRIBUTE AGAIN SO- SO REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT HOW IS YOUR HAVE YOU DISCUSSIONS. WHAT KIND OF SOLUTIONS COMING WITH WHAT KIND OF INNOVATIONS ARE COMING WITH AND HOW WE CAN BE HELPFUL THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND AGAIN THANK YOU DIRECTOR OF SORROW IS A GOOD. INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION AND WE DO APPRECIATE IT APPRECIATE. THE WORK YOU'RE DOING AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE.

BUT CAN YOU TELL ME THAT DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY MORE EQUITABLE. THE OUTCOMES ARE THAT WE HAVE MORE EQUITABLE SERVICES THAT THE OUTCOMES OF THE PEOPLE RECEIVE THE SERVICES IS ACTUALLY MORE EQUITABLE THAN IT WAS. THEN IT IS NOW. IS THE- IS THE- I MET SELF THE LEADERSHIP. BE UPSET RIGHT NOW SO. THE THE WORKFORCE ETCETERA SO- ARE ARE WE DEVELOPING OUTCOME METRICS- TO GO ALONG WITH THE- PROCESS METRICS. AND THAT THAT YOU'RE DONE FINE. THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES- WE ARE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF HIRING AN AGENCY EQUITY OFFICERS WHO WILL BE LEADING THIS WORK FULL TIME AND PART OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS TO HAVE THE STRATEGIC PLANNING CONTRACTING TIME TO ALIGN. THE MANY INITIATIVES BUT YES WE ENVISION THAT THIS STRATEGIC PLAN WILL BE BOTH INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL FACING LOOKING AT US AS THE LARGEST AGENCY IN THE LARGEST STATE BUT ALSO LOOKING EXTERNALLY AT. THE OUTCOMES AROUND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WITH THE MANY PROGRAMS IN OUR SEVENTEEN DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES FOR CALIFORNIANS AND THAT STARTS WITH PROCESS MEASURES BUT IT ENDS IN OUTCOME MEASURES AS WELL SO. VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES WILL BE ENCOURAGE JUST LIKE THE BY NURSE ADMINISTRATION ASKED ALL SECRETARIES TO DO ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PUBLICLY SHARE THESE EQUITY ACTION PLANS WITH OUTCOME MEASURES AS WELL SO- WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT MAY BE SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC AROUND. INFANT AND MATERNAL MORTALITY THE DISPARITY REDUCTION- BUT THE GOAL IS TO ALIGN AROUND COMMON DEFINITIONS AND WAYS OF MEASURING CREATE THIS A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE SO WE CAN SHARE PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES BOB AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE AIM TO INCLUDE. IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN AS WELL AS IN PHASE TWO OF THE EQUITY DASHBOARD OUTCOME METRICS AT APPRECIATE THAT. SHE SHARED THAT WITH OUR COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE I HAVE A BILL SB SEVENTEEN THAT- ALSO- TRIES TO CREATE THAT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND NO WE'RE STILL NOT TALKING WITH NOW NO WITH THE FOLKS ABOUT THAT- THAT I THINK IN THE AND- AND I APPRECIATE. THAT YOU ARE LOOKING OUTCOME MEASURES DEATHS IN THE AND WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEY THEY THEY DON'T PERFORM IT IF THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE CHANGE AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND APARTMENT BELIEVES AND SO- YEAH APPRECIATE YOU COULD SHARE THAT- AS YOU. FINALLY. THEN APPLY THEM IN YOUR PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEBATE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS. OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE A NUMBER TO THE OFFICE OF RESILIENCE AND RESPONSE AND I THINK WE'LL BE JOINED BY CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER. IT'S QUITE A TITLE ELIZABETH BASNET. HI GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY- MY ANSWER WAS A BASS AND I'M THE CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND I'M- I JUST WANT TO KIND OF DIVE AND SO AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE A SEASON ANY LONGER THE IDEA OF A FIRE SEASON AND WE MOVED THROUGH IT. AND MOVE ON WITH OUR DAY TO DAY WORK DOESN'T EXIST- WE'RE VERY MUCH IN A TWENTY FOUR DISASTER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN DISASTER CYCLE. AND THIS CAUSES DEPARTMENTS TO CONSISTENTLY HAVE TO HAVE PARALLEL OPERATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE DISASTERS. SO WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS IS THAT THE ONSET OF A DISASTER ITS IMPACT THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND WE HAVE THAT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WE'RE STILL ACTIVELY PURSUING WILDFIRE RECOVERY OPERATIONS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE STILL RESPONDING IN SOME WAY TO COPE ED AS WELL AS DROUGHT IMPACTS AND PREPARING FOR ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE SCENES AND WHILE OF COURSE. WE HAVE MORE DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC RESPONSES LIKE OUR BORDER OPERATIONS. SO CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WAS REAL ORIGINALLY DESIGNED MANAGE DATED HARPER RATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AS YOU ALL KNOW. IN THAT MISSION ALONE REQUIRES ALL THE STAFF THAT CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY OVERSEES FULL AND PART TIME EMPLOYEES. SO PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN A DISASTER WORK FOR THE DURATION WAS SHORT TERM AND. YOU ARE WITH THE TEMPORARY REDIRECTION OF STAFF THAT COULD THEN BE REDIRECTED BACK WITHIN PROBABLY LESS THAN THIRTY DAYS OFTENTIMES MAYBE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS DEPENDING ON THE DURATION OF A FIRE OR SEASON OR SOMETHING THAT WAS OF SIGNIFICANT COST. SO THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE WHICH REALLY BRINGS US TO THIS PROPOSAL AROUND FOR A FULL TIME AND DEDICATED OFFICE AND TEAM. WHO ARE MANAGING AND LEADING OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE DISASTER CONTINUE ON. SO THIS REQUEST IS TWO POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING FUNDING ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS FOR NINE POSITIONS TO OVERSEE FIVE CRITICAL PROGRAM AREAS WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS WHICH AS- PREPAREDNESS. RESPONSE RECOVERY MITIGATION RESILIENCE AND THEN SPECIAL PROJECTS. THAT COME ALONG AND I THINK UP AS A RESULT THIS. THIS DEDICATED TEAM ARE CONTINUES TO ALLOW US TO BREAK DOWN CYCLES ARE SILOS BETWEEN OUR DEPARTMENTS. UP PUT THE PERSON MAKE SURE THE PERSON STAYS AND PERSON CENTERED APPROACH THAT WE- VALUE HERE AGENCY AND WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION- AND GIVES US THE FORESIGHT TO CONTINUALLY LOOK AHEAD. AS WE HAVE THIS AN INDICATION OF DISASTERS AND I'LL STOP THERE. AND SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT I CAN ANSWER- DEPARTMENT. NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD THE HELLO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS SONYA PADDOCK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WE WOULD NOTE THAT KELLY TO JAZZ HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS REQUESTING THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THE CREATION OF THIS OFFICE RATHER THAN PERMANENT FUNDING. I'M REALLY IN ORDER TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND REEVALUATE THE NEED FOR THE OFFICE AND WHETHER IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AND WE KNOW HOWEVER THAT THE PROPOSAL LACKS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS RE EVALUATION WOULD WORK SO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD AGENCY CONDUCTS. FORMALISTS THAT'S MEANT. AND WHAT WOULD THEY CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER THAT THE OFFICE HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND WARRANTS PERMANENT FUNDING. I'M NOR DOES THE PROPOSAL DESCRIBED HOW THE AGENCY WOULD INVOLVE THE LEGISLATURE IN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION SO. WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ASPECT OF THE PROPOSAL AND THEN FINALLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ACCOMPANYING. TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE IMPORTANT FOR IRONING OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS AND LAYING OUT EXPECTATIONS FOR THE OFFICE- WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR LETTUCE. FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS AS SOON AS IT'S FEASIBLE FOR THEM TO DO SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MS BEST A CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE FOR THE FOR THE FIRST ISSUE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO I THINK- WHEN LOOKING AT ASSESSMENT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE LAID OUT VERY CLEAR OBJECTIVES FROM THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH WITH ESTABLISHING OFF THE OFFICE YOU KNOW WITHIN A HUNDRED AND STUFF A TWENTY DAYS WORKING WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO. REALLY PERFORM THREAT AND RISK ASSESSMENT FOR EACH DEPARTMENT BY HOUSE FOR WITHIN TWO HUNDRED FORTY DAYS AS THE STOP WISHING THE OFFICE OF RESPONSE AND RESILIENCE UNDERSTAND THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO ALL HAZARDS AND- AN EQUITABLE AND COMPREHENSIVE MANNER SO I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS AND GETTING TO. THE THREE YEAR MARK- ABSOLUTELY PUTTING TOGETHER KIND OF A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT OF NOT ONLY DID WE NEED BASIC METRICS BUT HOW IS IT CHANGING INVOLVED OUR RESPONSE TO DISASTERS. FOR WHAT WE LEARNED OBVIOUSLY IN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS IN RESPONSE TO COVIDIEN EVEN. PRIOR TO THAT AND WHAT OUR DISASTER RESPONSE FOR LIKE VERSUS WHAT IT'S LOOK LIKE ARE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WITH THIS OFFICE AND BE ABLE TO SHOW. THE EVOLUTION CHANGE AND GROWTH AND THEN OBVIOUSLY SHARING THAT INFORMATION BACK. IN AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING MORE NOT NOT AT. ARE WE LOOKING AT SERVICE DELIVERY THROUGH A CRISIS ARE WE LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUALS DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO ADAPT DURING A CRISIS. WELL I THINK IT'S PAUL- IS THE SHORT ANSWER SO I'LL JUST USE DROUGHT FOR EXAMPLE I THINK OBVIOUSLY TOP OF EVERYONE'S MIND SO INFORMATION OBVIOUSLY OUR DEPARTMENTS HAVE THEIR STATUTORY. IS THAT THEY HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY SO FOR DROUGHT ALREADY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENTS NOW HOW ARE WE TRACKING NEW APPLICANTS FOR CALFRESH OR CAL WORKS HOW'RE WE- ARE WATCHING THE CHANGING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY HEALTH CARE PLANS. ON IN A COUNTY THAT'S MAY BE AFFECTED BY D. FOUR EXCEPTIONAL DROUGHT HOW ARE WE LOOKING AT WHAT PARTICIPATION DATA SO WHEN WERE ANALYZING IMPACT DATA. THAT COMES UP TO AGENCY WORK COLLATING AT CREATING A STATEWIDE PICTURE IT ALLOWS US TO INFORM COMPREHENSIVE DECISION MAKING POLICY DECISION MAKING TO EXPAND SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OR WHATEVER THAT MAY D. B. CREATE THAT INTENT SEND IT BACK DOWN AND THEN OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE ALL GROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION ON A COMPREHENSIVE. MISSION THAT'S AN INFORMED POLICY SO I THINK IT'S ON BOTH SIDES. OKAY IN AN- UNTIL IT IS OUR COORDINATION BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF- YES WHICH HAS SOME OF THESE RULES AT LEAST. WHEN A CRISIS IS OCCURRING TWO ONE INTERFACE WITH THE PUBLIC. ABSOLUTELY I THINK WE HAVE A VERY STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH- YES AND EVEN THROUGHOUT THE COVERT RESPONSE WE'VE SEEN YOU KNOW- YES MAINTAINS THAT AUTHORITY OBVIOUSLY TO TRY DIRECTORATE DISASTER RESPONSE BUT THIS ALLOWS THEM. TO KIND OF HAVE THIS SINGULAR POINT OF CONTACT ON THESE LARGER POLICY DECISIONS- AND ENSURE THAT IF THEY'RE PUTTING FOR POLICY DECISIONS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR DEPARTMENTS AND EXECUTING THOSE THINGS SO- VERY TIGHTLY COORDINATED WITH- YES OKAY. THEN I KNOW IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT. I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT BACK AND- AND WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS- AND THEN IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER. OKAY THANK YOU CAN. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF RESILIENCE OFFICER LIKE THAT TITLE WHEN I SEE IF I CAN GET ONE OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER THREE. M. I THINK OUR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ADAM. DONDERO WILL BE PRESENTING THIS. BUDGET GINGEROLS LABOR FINANCE LETTER. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR THIS IS DEANNA MARTIN I'LL BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF ADAM TODAY WELCOME THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU BUT THE YEAR IN THE CENTER PAMPER HEARING OR PROPOSAL TODAY. TWO YEARS AGO THERE WERE ABOUT SIXTY ACTIVE IT PROJECTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS ACROSS HER AGENCY SINCE THEN OUR DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE PRAMAC PROGRAMMATIC ACCOUNTABILITY YOUNGER WORKLOAD. AND OF COURSE CORRESPONDING DEMAND FOR AUTOMATION. WE NOW HAVE NINETY I. T. PROJECTS RICHER IN THE NUMBER IS INCREASING WE HAVE NEW AND ENHANCED PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO REQUIRE NEW CAPABILITIES. PROGRAMS VERY VERY MUCH NEED THE SOLUTIONS TO ENGAGE AND SERVE OUR PUBLIC INTO SUPPORTER MISSION OF HELPING THOSE WHO MOST NEED OUR HELP. AND WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO BUILD THESE SOLUTIONS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. SO ARE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DO THIS REALLY AND FREEWAYS. FIRST OF ALL ARE PROPOSAL CAN REDUCE THE TIME NEEDED TO GET PROGRAMS THE I. T. SOLUTIONS THAT THEY NEED- AND MAKING SURE THAT THE SOLUTIONS BOTH SUPPORT DEPARTMENTS NEEDS AND AGENCY NEEDS SPECIFICALLY OUR STRATEGIC PRIORITIES. WHILE ALSO REDUCING COSTS AND RISKS. WE'LL DO THIS BY ESTABLISHING A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE AND THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE WILL INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF HELPING YOU WITH SPECIFIC HELP IN HUMAN SERVICES SPECIFIC TOOLS TEMPLATES AND PROCESSES DEFINED DOCUMENTED REPEATABLE PROCESSES AND CORRESPONDING ARTIFACTS. THAT WILL FORMALLY A FOUNDATION FOR HIGHER QUALITY FASTER PLANNING- THEIR PROCUREMENTS. BETTER DEVELOPMENT AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND I. T. SOLUTIONS YOU ALSO INCLUDE GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS THAT WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER SEAMLESSLY SO THEY CAN ACT AND THIS ALLOWS US TO CAPTURE AND SHARE DATA AND GENERATE DATA. THAT CAN INFORM OUR POLICY AND PROGRAMS AND SERVICE DESIGN SO WE CAN USE THE DATA WE'RE SHARING INFORMATION ACROSS PROGRAMS CAN GENERATE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE THE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. AARDMAN'S HISTORICALLY BEEN DEPARTMENT CENTRIC THERE'S DEVELOPMENT AND THE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING SOLUTIONS THAT WILL WORK AND TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER. IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE HAVE THIS AGENCY LANDS IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO AFFECT THE WHOLE PERSON NEEDS THAT ARE SO CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA. THE SAME RESOURCES WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE ACROSS ALL F OUR DEPARTMENTS TO HELP AND USE THESE TOOLS WITH THE GOAL OF BUILDING ONGOING SELF SUFFICIENCY AND REDUCING RELIANCE. ON VENDOR SUPPORT FOR PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF I. T. SOLUTIONS. THEY ALSO CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THESE ARTIFACTS IN PROCESS IS BASED ON WHAT WE'RE LEARNING THE LESSONS LEARNT FOR PROJECTS- ULTIMATELY TO EVEN FURTHER SO AT THE SPEED OF OUR DEVELOPMENT ARE ALREADY. THE SECOND WAY. THAT WE CAN HELP SPEED QUALITY AND TIME. WILL BE THAT WE WILL HAVE A RESOURCE IS A SMALL SET OF HIGHLY TECHNICAL RESOURCES SCARCE RESOURCES THAT CAN JUMPSTART AND AUGMENT TEAMS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENTS ESPECIALLY ARE SMALLER DEPARTMENTS YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS AND HOUSE AND WOULD FIND IT VERY HARD TO ACQUIRE THEM. THESE EXPERTS WILL INCLUDE FOLKS IN ENTERPRISE AND DATA ARCHITECTURE WHICH WILL HELP MAKE SURE SOLUTIONS ARE INTEGRATED. AS WELL AS CYBER SECURITY AGAIN VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ENOUGH OF THESE RESOURCES FOR APARTMENTS WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES WHICH HAPPENS SO OFTEN RIGHT NOW IT DELAYS PROJECTS START. IT RESULT IN SOLUTIONS THAT ARE FORMALLY OUR ARCH ARE FULLY INFORMED IN THESE AREAS. AND ULTIMATELY IT MEANS THAT WE INCUR MORE RISK AND IT TAKES MORE TIME TO GET PROGRAMS THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. SORRY BE RUBBER QUEST FOR THE SERIES IS REALLY ABOUT ESTABLISHING THE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE ONE MEASURING ITS VALUE AND THE BENEFIT THAT WE CAN DELIVER FOR AUGMENTING THE TEAM SO WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AND SAY. ARE DEPARTMENTS USING A SERVICE IF IT HELPING OUT ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE SAY IT'S GOING TO DO. FINALLY THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR EXISTING AND OUR REQUIRED I. T. ASSETS. ACROSS AGENCY. WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE WE'VE EEN MORE DEPARTMENT CENTRIC AND HOW WE DEVELOPING MANAGER PROJECTS. HAVING THAT WILL INFORM OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR INVESTMENTS AND WILL REALLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO REPORT ON PROGRESS. AND RESULTS. VERY FOCUSED THESE DAYS ON DELIVERING BUSINESS VALUE IN MEASURING THAT BUSINESS VALUE. IN DOING SO AS I SAY RIDLEY. ULTIMATELY WHAT WILL BE DEVELOPING IS THIS ENTERPRISE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO DO THAT. IT'S GOING TO COLLECT ORGANIZING USED DATA ABOUT OUR EXISTING IT SOLUTIONS. IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE A DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND TOOLS THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO. WILL BE ABLE THEN TO FORECAST NEAR AND LONG TERM CAPACITY GOING TO NEED FOR MODERNIZATION ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW SOLUTIONS. AND IT WILL ALLOW FOR IMPROVED PLANNING AND PRIORITIZATION OF IT PROJECTS IN RELATED FUNDING REQUEST BASED BASED ON WHAT DEPARTMENTS NEED AS WELL AS THE AGENCY NEEDS. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WILL DO THAT'S CRIPPLING SAVES TIME AND MONEY IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT EARLY IDENTIFICATION FOR SOLUTION RADIUS. THIS IS WHEN ONE DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED A SOLUTION TO- IT JUST FOR CASE MANAGEMENT OR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION ETCETERA WE CAN START USING THE INFORMATION FOR CAPTURING CHIU INFORM OTHER EFFORTS THAT NEEDS SIMILAR CAPABILITIES AND RATHER THAN REBUILD SOLUTIONS OR BUILD NEW SOLUTIONS. WE CAN FOCUS ON RE USING ARE LEVERAGING WHAT WE HAVE. SECONDARILY WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR REPORTING BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITH REGARDS TO THE STATE OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AND IN THE FIRST YEAR WORLD LOOKED ESTABLISH THAT AND GET DEPARTMENT BRIAN THE PROGRAM UP AND STANDING. AND WILL CONFIRM THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS AND PROCESSES IN THE PERFORMANCE METRICS WE USE TO DETERMINE IF. THE MONEY WE'RE SPENDING IS DELIVERING THE BENEFIT WHERE RESEARCH ASSISTANT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE PROPOSAL CAN HELP US REALLY SPEND RESOURCES WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED. AND WE CAN GIVE REALLY DELIVER THE BENEFIT OF I. T. MORE QUICKLY AND AT LOWER COST AND THIS WILL ALLOW PROGRAMS TO FOCUS THEIR TIME. AND MONEY I'M REALLY DELIVERING THE SERVICES THEY HELP FOLKS. SO THIS MIGHT BE HAPPENING AFTER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU. FROM FROM YOUR LIPS TO GOD'S EARS WE HOPE THIS WORKS US DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I THINK FOR THAT- BELIAU. RYAN METZGER L. A. L. WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN HERE A LITTLE WHILE I WOULD INCLUDE MYSELF AND DOCTOR PAN HAS HEARD NOTHING BUT A PROBLEMS WITH IT SO THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO THAT- IS A GOOD THING SO WHEN I T. PROJECTS. TAKE TOO LONG THAT COST TOO MUCH DON'T FUNCTION SO THIS ONE DEPARTMENT WILL BE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING THAT VERSES THE INDIVIDUAL PART THE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT WHERE THE I. T. A PROGRAM IS HOUSED IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND. NOT QUITE IT CURRENTLY OUR OFFICE DOES OVERSEE ALL OF THE I. T. PROJECT THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS A LARGE NUMBER WE TEND TO FOCUS ON THE ONES THAT ARE MOST STRATEGIC OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE OUR FRIENDS IT IT CDT CENTER. AT DAYTON TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE OVERSEEING OUR BIGGEST AND MOST COMPLEX PROJECTS WITH LASTING PARTNERSHIP. WHAT THIS SEPARATE WILL REALLY DO IS TRY TO GET AHEAD OF ALL THAT RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE OVERSEEING THESE PROJECTS HAVE RECEIVED THESE TRENDING ISSUES THAT WE THINK WE CAN ADDRESS. REFORM JUST A SMALL CADRE OF RESOURCES WITHIN. THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR OFFICE DO YOU TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE UP FRONT SO THAT WHEN WE'RE OVERSEEING AND WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND WE'RE PREVENTING THE DELAYS AND THE RISKS. OKAY SO IF WE'VE IF WE'VE SEEN A LIGHT AND TUNNEL FOR THE TRAINING ON A DIFFERENT PROJECT WILL BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SAME LIGHT. IN A DIFFERENT TIME ALL. RIGHT WILL BE ABLE TO. IT OKAY. DR PEPPER. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE I DID NOT POSE A QUESTION BECAUSE INTERESTING ENOUGH- IN LOOKING OVER GENDER WE HAVE- LATER ON WE'LL BE DISCUSSING IT DEPARTMENT WHO'S ALSO ASKING FOR I. T. RESOURCES AND- ACTUALLY THEY THEY ACTUALLY MADE THIS THE LEAST AND ANALYSIS THERE'S A STATEMENT THAT- THEY NEED. ONE I. T. PERSON FOR EVERY TEN WORKERS TO SUPPORT TO SUPPORT THEIR I. T. AND SO- I COULD ASK THEM HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THAT NUMBER- BUT THEY'RE NOT I. T. EXPERTS BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S AN AGENCY IN THIS THE PART AND THE PART OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THAT'S NOT THEIR EXPERTISE. SO I GUESS THE I QUESTION TO YOU AND MAYBE EVEN A FOLLOW UP WITH L. A. L. IS THAT- BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING HERE DOING OVERSIGHT WE'RE GETTING THESE REQUESTS. HOW DO WE EVALUATE AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT AND MAYBE THAT PRIMARY TALK TO YOU- BUT- IN TERMS OF THE AYE IT AND KNOWING THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF PARTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES IN A DIFFERENT TASKS AND DIFFERENT HAVE DIFFERENT I. T. NEEDS. IN TERMS OF TRYING. TO ASSESS- THE KNOW LOOKING AT THE LARGER PICTURE RIGHT SO I MEAN I'M SURE EACH DEPARTMENT AND I DON'T AND- YOU MAYBE YOU. YEAH AND I THINK AS YOU PRESENTED. YOU ARE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THESE APARTMENTS BUT A CERTAIN EXTENT SOME OF THE PARTS OF REALLY LARGE RIGHT AND- DAY MAY INTERNALLY HAVE THEIR OWN IT JUST LIKE. THE EIGHTY JUST IS REALLY LARGE HAS YOUR DEPARTMENT. AND THEN WE HAVE FOR THE WHOLE STATE GOVERNMENT WITH DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY SO WE REALIZE A DIFFERENT LAYERS. THAT SO MAYBE CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE PLAYERS ARE COORDINATED IN TERMS OF. DETERMINING THAT WHETHER WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE I. T. SUPPORT FOR EACH OF THE DIFFERENT. AGENCIES AND FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT- PARTICULARLY RELATED TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF KNOWING THAT ONE OF YOUR AGENCIES LATER ON WILL BE PRESENTED TO US REQUESTING SOME IT. SUPPORT WHICH YOU KNOW I. LOOKED FINE AND I'M SURE L. A. L. GIVES THEIR OPINION THAT MORE ANALYZE OPINIONS. BUT I ALSO WONDERED. HOW THAT YOU'RE FACED WITH YOUR REQUEST HERE. YEAH YES SIR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. A ONE TO TEN RATIO THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS GENERALLY USED FOR AT THE- CORE IT SUPPORT NET INVOICING STAFF WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT NEED IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE I. T. PROJECTS THAT ARE OFTEN INCREMENTAL TO THAT. OKAY SO NINE ONE TO TEN IS THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A STANDARD THE THAT- GENDER SO I COULD GET BECAUSE I KNOW I JUST SAW THAT AND WHAT. WE'RE THAT COME FROM SOUTH AFRICA RIGHT INTO ITS DEPARTMENTS GROWING GET MORE PEOPLE THEY NEED MORE I. T. STAFF AT THE END THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT. THAT I BELIEVE DOCTORS USED AS WELL. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO THINK THAT MEANS EVERY TIME WE GROW TEN PEOPLE TO DO WHATEVER FRONT LINE WORK WE NEED. WE THEN HAVE ANOTHER YOU KNOW AFTER AND I DEEPER SO REALLY THAT COMES ELEVEN RIGHT AND THEN. RECOGNIZING OF COURSE DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE WORK AND I THINK THERE'S OF COURSE OTHER TYPES OF PEOPLE THEY NEED AS ALL OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORT AS WELL AND- I CHAU NODDING THEIR HEADS SO YOU AGREE AS WELL. ALL THREE D. AGREE- ONE MY COLLEAGUES BE ADDRESSED. THAT A PROPOSAL LATER ON IN THE JETTA SO. HOPEFULLY THEY CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THAT ONE. OKAY WELL I THIS IS A MORE OF AN I. T. QUESTION I THOUGHT IT ASK IT NOW JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE I. T. EXPERTS VERSES. ASKING AN AGENCY- THAT. MY VIEWS THE STANDARD THAT THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH BUT WOULDN'T AND THAT'S REALLY NOT THE JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE- THEIR- THEIR MAIN TASK IS. NOT HIGH T. CELL OKAY. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO. TO TO ANSWER MY QUESTION AND SET TO TOUCH ON THAT- BUT THERE'S- I THINK THE CHAIR MENTIONED. WE GET TASKED WITH OVERSEEING- AND I WILL BE VERY CLEAR ACTUALLY. THE PROBLEM WITH IT PROJECTS IS THAT. WHEN THEY DON'T WORK THAT'S WHEN THEY HIT THE NEWS SO USUALLY THE NEWS IS JUST LIKE YOU KNOW AND THEY'RE COMPLICATED. WHEN THEY DO WORK. PEOPLE TO DOESN'T MAKE THE NEWS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF IT PROJECTS ACTUALLY WORK THEM FAMILIAR WITH IN STATE GOVERNMENT. I ALSO KNOW IF YOU THAT DIDN'T WORK AND GET THE NEWS. SO WE'D LIKE TO KEEP THE I. T. OUT OF THE NEWS. THAT'S. WHERE THAT WAY I THINK EVERYONE'S HAPPIER THAT WAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU AGAIN. AS THE DIRECTOR WORKING FOR THAT A PRESENTATION. VERY INFORMATIVE. OKAY MOVING ON TO- ISSUE NUMBER FOR SOME TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS- THAT WILL BE.

WITH THE SECOND ITEM RELATED TO FUNDING WITH IN CALLIE TAKE JUST RELATED TO OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND THE EVALUATION AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPENDITURES WILL VARY OVER TIME SO ONE OF THE THINGS WORKING VERY HARD ON RIGHT NOW IS.

AND DEAL ARE IS ASKING FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A PROJECT THAT WILL AND THAT ONE CORPORATE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES INTO RECOVERY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AS JOE EXAME YOUR MENTIONED EARLIER I'M- AT IMPLEMENT HAS BEEN BEEN PROVEN TO BE A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND- IN THE TREATMENT OF A FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISABILITIES. IT SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND- REDUCTION OF VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND- AT LAST FREQUENTED YOUR HOSPITALIZATION LESS INVOLVEMENT WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE ARE A LOT OF PROVEN BENEFITS. OF INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT SUPPORTS IN RECOVERY. AND THIS- PROJECT WILL ALLOW US TO DO THE SAME WHEN IT COMES TO THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I HAVE A PERSONAL CONNECTION TO THIS PROJECT MYSELF I AM A PERSON IN RECOVERY- I'M UP UNTIL EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS AT DAILY USER OF ILLICIT OPIOIDS. AND AND I'M REALLY AGAIN LIKE I SAID. I'M HONORED TO BE HERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY TO PRESENT ON THIS PROJECT. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT COME. TO THE WORK I'M ONE. PROVIDING EDUCATE. TO THE- PROVIDER WORK FORCE SO WE'RE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING% CURRICULUM THAT CAN BE USED WITHOUT EMERGING AT PROVIDER WORK FORCE. TO HELP THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT IN RECOVERY AND ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION OR VR SYSTEM ON THE OTHER WORKFORCE PARTNERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP THE INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR SERVING. AS DAY- AS THEY COMPLETE TREATMENT AND EITHER I'M LOOK FOR WORK OR RETURN TO- TO PREVIOUS EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT COMPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE- WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS THE STAFFING FOR BOTH THE DEVELOPING AND THEN FOR THE DELIVERY. OF THOSE TRAININGS THE SECOND PIECE OF THE PROPOSAL IS AND TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS TO PILOT WITH FOR TREATMENT CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE IN BETTING VIA OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF INTO THOSE CENTERS AS MEMBERS OF THE TREATMENT TEAM. TO PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES A WHILE INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING- OTHER TREATMENT SERVICES AT THE SAME TIME AND TO BE ABLE TO- TO HIGHER. INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE- WHO ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT IN THE AREAS A IN THE- FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT THEY'LL BE SERVING AND SO THAT PIECE OF IT IS- IS TO EMBED BOTH. WHAT WE CALLED QUALIFIED REHABILITATION PROFESSIONALS REHABILITATION COUNSELOR AS WELL AS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS PART OF THE TREATMENT TEAM. TO SUPPORT- EMPLOYMENT SKILLS AND SO OF COURSE OF THOSE IN THE WHO ARE GOING TO TREATMENT. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED IN ADVANCE ON THE FIRST IS THE FUNDING BREAKDOWN FOR THE TO PURPOSES AND SO AS I'VE INDICATED ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AS TOWARDS THE TRAINING COMPONENT FOR THE PROVIDER WORK FORCE AND THE TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR INVITING STAFF INTO- INTO TREATMENT CENTERS TO PROVIDE B. R. SERVICES. AS PART OF A TREATMENT TEAM. THE SECOND QUESTION. WAS REGARDING. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS THE PROGRAM TO BEGIN OPERATING. FOR THE TRAINING COMPONENT OUR INTENTION IS TO BEGIN RECRUITING RIGHT AWAY AND DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM WITH THE- WITH THE GOAL OF BEGINNING TO DELIVER THOSE TRAININGS TO THAT MARGIN WORK FORCE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE THOSE TRAININGS THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE THREE YEARS. THAT YEAH EMBEDDING OF THE STAFF AND THE EMPLOYMENT CENTERS I'M SORRY IN THE TREATMENT CENTERS- FOR THAT COMPONENT WE ARE EXPECTING TO FINALIZE THE TREATMENT CENTERS THAT WILL RECEIVE THOSE STAFF MEMBERS BY AROUND SEPTEMBER OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND THEN BEGIN TO ACTUALLY CO LOCATE STAFF THERE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR TWO OF THE CENTERS- AND THEN LEARNING FROM FROM- THE FIRST CHIU CENTERS CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY TWO ADDITIONAL CENTERS. ON AND THAT THE STAFF. IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE LAST QUESTION THAT WE HAVE WAS REGARDING HOW WE WOULD SELECT THE CENTERS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A PILOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- AS AS AGAIN DRUG DURING SAVE YOUR SPOKE ABOUT- AND AS I'VE HEARD THROUGH SOME OF THE EARLIER PRESENTATIONS REPRESENTATION. MATTERS WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE CHOOSING TREATMENT CENTERS THAT REFLECT VARIED EXPERIENCE WHETHER THAT BE- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE- POPULATIONS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED. OR PERHAPS YOU HAVE BEEN ON. WHO HAVE BEEN- EXCUSE ME I'M- WHO WHO REALLY EXPERIENCED AND BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE OPIOID CRISIS SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CHOOSE TREATMENT CENTERS I'M TO REFLECT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE GREATEST NEED. AND SO WE'D LIKE TO DO THAT WITH- A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH I'M SEEKING OUT THOSE CENTERS WHERE INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED FULL SERVICES IN OTHER WAYS AND PUT OUR STAFF THERE AND IT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO HIRE STAFF WHO ARE CULTURALLY COMPETENT IN SERVING THOSE POPULATIONS AND WITH THE INTENTION OF HAVING THEM BE THEMSELVES AS A PEER SUPPORT SO AS A MEMBER OF THE TREATMENT TEAM BUT ALSO SOMEONE THAT CAN GAIN THE TRUST OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN RECOVERY. AND SPEAK TO THEM FROM AN INFORMED POSITION ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT FOR US BEING THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION AND INTERESTED IN EMPLOYMENT IS INVITING STAFF IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT HAVE A TO. EMPLOYMENT LANDSCAPE SO WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WE'RE TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WHO FOR EXAMPLE ARE IN A RURAL SETTING OR THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT PERHAPS THAN AS TREATMENT CENTER THAT MAY BE IN A METROPOLITAN AREA WHERE THERE THERE MIGHT BE OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT AND DIFFERENCES IN THE NECESSARY SUPPORT SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION- AT AND THE OTHER COMPONENTS THAT GO ALONG WITH. EMPLOYMENT AND WITH WORK EXPERIENCE. I'M WITH I WILL HOW TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE PRINTER TO GROW FROM WERE ALSO VERY GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE ON ON THIS ISSUE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BAKER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME HALFPENNY AS ANY QUESTIONS OF THANK YOU SPITAK. THANK YOU SENATE HEADED FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE JUST HAVE ONE- FAIRLY MINOR COMMENT ABOUT THAT HI THE PROPOSED PILOT PROGRAMS FOR THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND THAT IS- YOUR HAS INDICATED THAT- THAT HAS NOT QUITE WORKED OUT YET HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE THIS NOVEL- PILOT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S- WHETHER IT'S A SUCCESSFUL MODEL THAT AND WHEN THE COULD BE SORT OF REPLICATED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- IN THE CONVERSATIONS THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED. TO US THAT IT IS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS AND THAT IT'S YOU KNOW KIND OF A NUANCED ISSUE- HOWEVER AS WRITTEN THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY MENTION OF AN EVALUATION AND SO THERE IS CONSEQUENTLY NO WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT ONE WOULD BE CONDUCTED. AND OUR OFFICE THINGS THIS WOULD BE SORT OF A MISSED OPPORTUNITY AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ADDING A REQUIREMENT WERE IT TO APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK AYE SEE MS GROVE NODDING SO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT AN EVALUATION WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS. THANK YOU I WAS WONDERING IF I IF I MAY RESPOND. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND YES I AM IT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE V. R. SITE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE THINK WOULD BE. AN INCLUDED IN MEASUREMENTS. FOR THAT YOU KNOW FOR THE TRAINING COMPONENT- OF COURSE HOW MANY PEOPLE RECEIVED THIS TRAINING. I AM AND- THEN AND THEN. THE FRIEND THAT FOR THE IN BATTING THERE THE STAFF INTO THE TREATMENT CENTERS. THERE ARE SOME SOME SIMPLE. OF MEASURABLE SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVED SERVICES WHAT TYPES OF SERVICES DID THEY RECEIVINGA LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY DEAD. HOW MANY AND SHE THEIR WORK EXPERIENCE HOW MANY- ARE EMPLOYED AT THE RESOLUTION OF THEIR TREATMENTS HEY. I'M WOULD LOVE TO- DO SOME FOLLOW UP AS WELL WHERE POSSIBLE AND TO SEE IF PEOPLE ARE RETAINING EMPLOYMENT HOW THEY'RE DOING UP TO NINE MONTHS AFTER. TREATMENTS I'M- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FEEL WE MAY HAVE IS N. FOLLOW UP WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN TREATMENT AS AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW. AND TREATMENT. TYPICALLY DOESN'T FOLLOW A LINEAR PATH FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS AGES IT MAY BE SOMETHING WITH STARTS AND STOPS. AND THESE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES- CAN PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THAT WHOLE AND THAT CONNECTION TO STAY ENGAGE WITH RECOVERY EVEN ENOUGH. IT'S NOT MOVES ON AND WITHOUT FUNDS SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE THINK COULD BE BENEFICIAL BUT WE DO REALLY. NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE TREATMENT TEAMS ARE LOOKING NOT HOW LONG SOMEONE STAYS ENGAGED IN TREATMENT. CAN WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY OFFERING EMPLOYMENT SERVICES EARLY AND SUCCESSFULLY WELL THAT KEEPS THEM ON. ENROLLED IN TREATMENT WILL THAT HAVE A DIFFERENCE ON HOW LONG THEY STAY ENGAGED IN AFTER CARE. SO WE AGREED THAT THAT MEASUREMENT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE'RE I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT AND SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY I DO THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT I DO UNDERSTAND NUANCES BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT REALLY IN AND WORKING WELL WITH ANY POPULATION ESPECIALLY AROUND THE ABILITY SHIN. IS ON- RELATIONSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT- AND SO THEN I WOULD ALSO WONDER PLACES WHERE YOU'RE A BETTING PEOPLE WILL THERE BE A LEVEL OF EVALUATION. ALL FOR EXISTING STAFF ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HAVING EMBEDDED PEOPLE FROM DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. AS PART OF THAT EVALUATION. YEAH I THINK IT'S THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK ACROSS THE SPECTRUM MET THIS BECAUSE THE IDEA HERE IS TO. DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH THAT WE CAN. HOPE TO SCALE ACROSS YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PROGRAM. SO YES WILL LOOK TO DO THE JOB KEEP IN MIND THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH OTHER PARTNERS- AND OBVIOUSLY WILL. HAVE THEIR BY IAN AND IN DOING THIS AS WELL. THE REPLICATION IS ALWAYS THE GOAL OF IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL ON A REPLICA OF SINGLE LIKE THAT AREN'T WORKING WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT IN RETURNING THIS PROJECT THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERSON. AND GOING UPSTREAM AND THEIR EXPERIENCE WE REALLY HOPE. AND BELIEVE THIS WILL CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY FROM THAT FOR THEM IN THE LONG TERM- KNOW HOW IMPORTANT POINTS. IT'S JUST A REALLY I THINK A KEY THING TO BE TAKING ACTUALLY TWO PEOPLE IN WHILE IN RECOVERY- AND I AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST WONDER. ABOUT THE AVAIL. OF TREATMENT CENTERS AND SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL AREAS THAT WE KNOW HAVE BEEN HARDEST HIT WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. IF THEY EVEN HAVE TREATMENT TO START WITH TO IN BED- SOMEBODY FROM THE DEPARTMENT IN THERE SO I THINK THOSE THINGS WILL NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AN ONGOING BASIS GOING FORWARD. THIRTY PAN ANYTHING ON THIS NOW OKAY THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IMPORTANT WORK IN THEM I'M GLAD WHERE WE'RE TAKING IT ON.
