THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I WANT TO JOIN IN THANK OUR COLLEAGUE- AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS FOR THIS YOU KNOW THE HEART DISEASE IS A SECRET KILLER FOR WOMEN AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING THAT THE SIGNS THAT OF THAT EXIST FOR WOMEN WITH HEART DISEASE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE SIGNS THAT EXIST FOR MEN AND FOR DECADES WE BASICALLY IGNORED. THOSE SIGNS AND DIDN'T TREAT HEART DISEASE WITH WOMEN IN GREAT MEASURE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DO THE RESEARCH AND THE REASON WE DIDN'T DO THE RESEARCH IS THAT WELL WOMEN'S BODIES ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND SO IS SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM A FAMILY WHERE HEART DISEASE HAS A BEEN A KILLER OF FOR BOTH THE MEN AND WOMEN IN MY FAMILY I WANT APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW ADDRESSING WHAT IS BEEN FOR FAR TOO LONG A SECRET KILLER OF WOMEN. WE KNOW THAT MEN HAVE HEART ATTACKS AND HEART DSEASE AND CERTAINLY WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT WOMEN ARE EQUALLY IS SEPARABLE AND BY THIS READ PRESS DAY OR FOR SOME TO FOR BLACKS.

YEAH NOT ENOUGH JUST TO LIKE WAITING CALL THE DOCTOR SOMETHING NEED TO BAIL RECOGNIZE AN AXE WESLEY AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- I THINK IS THIS RESOLUTION NOTES AND I APPRECIATE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SANTA BARBARA POINTING IT OUT IS THAT. OFTENTIMES WHAT WE TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE SYMPTOMS THAT APPEAR. IN MEN. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN WOMENARE SUFFERING SYMPTOMS THAT THEN MAY LEAD TO A HEART ATTACK OR STROKE. THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM ARE NOT AS AWARE SO WE NEED TO RAISE THIS AWARENESS- SO THAT PEOPLE CAN RECOGNIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO THEY CAN ACT IN TIME TO BE SURE WE CAN MITIGATE.

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ASK YOU TO. ADJOURN IN MEMORY JOIN ME IN A JOURNEY IN MEMORY FOR WHITNEY DOTSON. WHITNEY WAS A PERSON THAT WAS VERY SPECIAL TO ME BUT HE WAS ALSO VERY SPECIAL TO. THE CITY OF RICHMOND IN EAST BAY HE WAS A LIFELONG ADVOCATE FOR THE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION. OF THE NORTH RICHMOND SHORELINE. HE GREW UP IN A PLACE CALLED PART CHESTER VILLAGE PORCHESTER VILLAGE WAS FOUNDED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO WERE BROUGHT TO. THE EAST BAY TO WORK IN THE SHIPYARDS AND THEY WERE OF COURSE PREVENTED FROM OWNING HOMES. SO IF YOU WERE TO SEE PORCHESTER VILLAGE NOW IT IS RIGHT ON THE SHORE LINE DEFINITELY- AT RISK FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. IN SOMEWHERE MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY OTHER THAN LOVELY VIEWS WOULD NEVER WANT TO LIVE BECAUSE IT'S A MARSH. AND I YET THOSE FAMILIES PARTLY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF WHITNEY'S FATHER THE REVEREND DOTSON. BUILT HOMES AND CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO OWN HOMES. AND THE FAMILIES THAT LIVED THERE ARE STILL FROM THOSE ORIGINAL FAMILIES. AND GROWING UP IN THAT MARSH AREA WHITNEY BECAME A LIFELONG ENVIRONMENTALIST. AND HE WHEN VARIOUS TIMES EITHER TO PUT IN A SMALL AIRPORT OR VARIOUS OTHER THINGS HE AND HIS FAMILY AND THE RESIDENTS OF PART CHESTER VILLAGE WOULD ORGANIZE. AND WORK TO PROTECT IT. I WAS ELECTED TO THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT BOARD THAT'S A INCREDIBLE I'M TO COUNTY REGIONAL PARK AREA IN THE EAST BAY. I AND I REPRESENTED THE WHOLE RICHMOND AREA PLUS OAKLAND BERKELEY AND WHEN I. GOT ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY THE POSITION BECAME AVAILABLE AND WHITNEY RAN AND I BACKED HIM 1100% TO HAVE A LIFELONG RICHMOND RESIDENT REPLACE ME ON THAT BOARD. TO FIGHT FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THAT AREA. AND SUBSEQUENTLY- THE ONE OF THE PARKS IN THAT AREA POINT PINOLE NOW HAS ITS PRIMARY MARSH NAMED AFTER THE DOTSON FAMILY. OUR WHITNEY STARTED THE NORTH RICHMOND SHORELINE FESTIVAL AND HE MADE SURE THAT THE PARK DISTRICT BROUGHT LOTS OF AMENITIES SO RESIDENTS OF RICHMOND WOULD USE IT. BECAUSE THERE'S OFTEN A BIG DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE AREAS THAT WE SET ASIDE AS PARKS IN THE IN THE PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE BEST ACCESS TO THEM WE DON'T ALWAYS CREATE THE- THE TRAILS OR THE WE DON'T CREATE THE KIND OF AMENITIES. THAT WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL WELCOME AND THAT'S WHAT WHITNEY STOOD FOR ANY FOUGHT FOR IT HARD AND HE SUCCEEDED HE PASSED AWAY UNFORTUNATELY IN EARLY JANUARY AT THE YOUNG AGE OF SEVENTY FIVE. BUT HE WILL BE TRULY MISSED BY ALL OF US AND I DIDN'T TELL YOU ABOUT HIS WONDERFUL BACKGROUND. HI IN HEALTH COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES HIS WORK OR THE STATE OR VARIOUS OTHER THINGS BUT ALL LEAVE IT THAT HE WAS A FANTASTIC PERSON. AND THE EAST BAY RICHMOND THE REGIONAL PARKS HIS FAMILY HIS SISTER RE LS START TO NEWMAN AND HIS SONS ARE DAY RJ J. LONNIE AND- LOOK MEN WILL GREATLY MISS MASS WILL LIE THANK YOU.
