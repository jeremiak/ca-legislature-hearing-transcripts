00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.160
ORGANIZATION THAT ANALYZES AND

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.096

DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX THE LARGER

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:05.037
THE FILE THE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:06.705
THEY ARE TO UNINTENTIONAL

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:09.074
ERRORS. AND OF COURSE EXTERNAL

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.644
MANIPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN%

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.012

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.614
I'M- IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND

DUPLICATED BY THE DMV AND LA

00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:27.660

FREESYNC ROSTERS. DUE TO EMERGE

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:38.904
ERROR. A HUNDRED THE THOUGHT I

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.772
THINK IT'S CLOSER TO HUNDRED

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:40.806
SEVENTY THOUSAND HAD POLITICAL

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:41.240
PARTY MISTAKES OR RE

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:44.743
ATTRIBUTIONS. MANY STUDIES OVER

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.212
TIME AND I WILL CITE THE CAL

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.081
TECH AND MY TEA VOTING

00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:51.684
TECHNOLOGY PROJECT REPORT IN

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.484
CONJUNCTION WITH THE- THAT THEY

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.720
DID WITH ORANGE COUNTY- MANY

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:56.221
STUDIES OVER TIME HAS SHOWN

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.891
THAT GENERATING AUDIT DATA IS

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:00.592
NECESSARY TO EVALUATE VOTER

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:03.262
FILE QUALITY AND ALEXIAN

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:06.699
INTEGRITY. AUDIT DATA ALSO

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.233
SERVES TO HELP IMPROVE

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.036
ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES. KEEP

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:13.105
IN MIND THAT AUDITS DO NOT JUST

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:15.808
NEED TO HAPPEN AFTER THE FACT

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.310
THEY COULD AND SHOULD BECOME

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:21.146
PART OF A DAILY PROCESS MAYBE

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.681
EVEN MINUTE BY MINUTE.

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:24.583
CALIFORNIA CAME LATE TO THE

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.685
GAME COMPARED TO OTHER STATES

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.387
WITH CENTRALIZED WITH A

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.689
CENTRALIZED VOTER DATABASE WE

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.891
ARE BIG STATE. AND PROBABLY

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.194
NEEDED THAT TIME- I BELIEVE

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.729
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.263
FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.066
STATES- INCORPORATED AND

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.203
COMPLIED WITH THAT- MANDATE

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:47.840
WITH ALL THAT TIME THE WRINKLES

00:16:47.906 --> 00:16:49.808
WERE CLEARLY NOT IRONED OUT

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.910
BEFORE LAUNCH. THIS ALONG WITH

00:16:51.977 --> 00:16:54.146
THE MOTOR VOTER OR WITH- VOTER

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.248
THAN ASSN SAME DAY REGISTRATION

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:59.284
AND SOON VOTE CENTERS MATE WILL

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.652
MAKE FOR TSUNAMI OF PROBLEMS

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.454
AND ALREADY HAVE THAT SEEM TO

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.690
CONSTANTLY COME TO LIGHT THERE

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:05.524
IS ENORMOUS PRESSURE ON COUNTY

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.960
REGISTRARS TO KEEP UP. AND THIS

00:17:08.026 --> 00:17:10.129
MAKES FOR PROCESS THAT FOR NOW

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:12.664
SEEMS TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.200
HONOR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEMS WE

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:17.936
HAVE FOUND THAT I FE. STARTED A

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.406
VERY FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL WHY ARE

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.174
THERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.342
PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF A

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:25.611
HUNDRED AND SIX WHICH AT LAST

00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:28.080
LOOK WAS THE OLDEST AGE OF. OF

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:30.182
RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA ON THE

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:31.884
VOTER ROLES IS IT DEAD PEOPLE

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.052
VOTING OR MERELY THE QUALITY.

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:36.255
OF THE DATA MAINTENANCE WE

00:17:36.321 --> 00:17:38.223
FOUND THAT IT WAS THE LATTER.

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.626
WIRE LAWSUITS LIKE THE ONE THAT

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:42.494
WAS RECENTLY WON BY JUDICIAL

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.164
WATCH IN LOS AGELES COUNTY-

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.832
WHY DID THEY HAPPEN WHERE THEY

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.467
FIND TWENTY FIRST WHEN THEY END

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.169
UP HAVING TO REMOVE TWENTY

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.738
PERCENT. OF THOSE REGISTERED

00:17:52.805 --> 00:17:54.740
THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.508
44% OF THE ELIGIBLE RESIDENTS

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.944
REGISTERED. TO VOTE. SO WILL

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.546
TAKE YEARS AND MILLIONS OF

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.815
TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ASSESS AND

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.784
THEN FIX THIS PROBLEM. THERE

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.953
MUST BE FILTERS SUCH AS THOSE

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.956
ADDRESSED IN SB FIFTY SEVEN. IN

00:18:11.023 --> 00:18:13.358
MY VIEW SB FOUTS FIFTY SEVEN SO

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:15.828
IT'S FOR SAFEGUARDS ALMOST AN

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:17.229
AUTOMATED FILTERING AN AUDIT

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:19.698
MECHANISM WHICH IS SO VERY

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.133
CRITICAL TO ANY FORM OF

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.969
INTEGRITY IN ALL FORMS OF DATA

00:18:24.036 --> 00:18:26.271
GATHERING. IT MOST CERTAINLY

00:18:26.338 --> 00:18:28.373
WILL SLOW DOWN INTERNAL QUALITY

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.578
DETERIORATION. WE NEED MORE OF

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.746
THESE TYPES OF STOP GAPS WITH

00:18:34.813 --> 00:18:36.482
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS WE CAN

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:38.317
PREVENT PROBLEMS INSTEAD OF

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:38.851
WAITING TO FIND THEM IN AN

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:42.321
AUDIT. MOST IMPORTANTLY THESE

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:43.989
FILTERS PROTECT NOT JUST THE

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.892
INTEGRITY OF THE ROLES BUT

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:47.493

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:51.230

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:25.196
FRAMEWORK OF OUR DEMOCRACY WE

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.064
ALL TALK ABOUT THIS GREAT

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:27.799
DEMOCRACY IN THE FOR AND WE

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.701
HAVE- THE PARTICIPATION LEVELS

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:32.070
AT A IT AREAS SPECIAL DISTRICT

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:33.538
IN THE COMMUNITIES ARE PRESENT

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.241
8% TURNOUT YOU KNOW I WE HAVE A

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:38.176
CORPORATION THE- UNDER THE LAW

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:40.945
UNLESS YOU- HAVE A CERTAIN-

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:42.747
MINIMUM NUMBER OF PARTICIPATION

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:44.182
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A QUORUM

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:46.484
NECESSARY TO CONDUCT BUSINESS.

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.185
AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING FOR

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.853
MANY YEARS WHETHER IT'S THE

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.256
SAME DAY OR WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:52.724
OF THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION DO

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.660
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENHANCE

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.795
OF DISSIPATION MOTOR VOTER HAS

00:29:57.862 --> 00:29:59.964
BEEN SOMETHING THAT THE

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:01.266
NATIONAL LEVEL CERTAIN TALKED

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:02.967
ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME AND

00:30:03.034 --> 00:30:03.635
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE IS PRETTY

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.136
EXTRAORDINARY IN TERMS OF THE

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:09.707
STATE'S NUMBERS- BUT I SEE A

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:11.676
DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT SENATOR

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.679
BATES TALKS ABOUT HERE IN WHAT

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:18.516
THE- LARGER ARGUMENT IS AGAINST

00:30:18.583 --> 00:30:20.318
THIS NOTION ABOUT. XIN AIR THE

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.085
GOAL PARTY MISSTEPS TRUST IN

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:24.355
THE DMV WHEN IN FACT WHAT WE

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:27.492
HAVE BEFORE US SO I JUST

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:31.196
ACTUALLY DO THIS ONLINE THE

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:31.763
OTHER DAY AND TRY TO GET MY-

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:34.165
THE LADY. AT TO THIS DAY I

00:30:34.232 --> 00:30:36.134
THINK OVER THE WEEKEND. FATHER

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:37.535
AND SO THE QUESTION THAT YOU

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.836
RAISED PAGE TWO IS THE ISSUE OF

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:40.171
WHAT BEST DESCRIBES YOU AND

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.472
WHAT WHAT I GOT FROM YOU

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.907
SENATOR BATES WASN'T THAT YOU

WANT AN OPT OUT YOU JUST WANT

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:48.046
CLARIFICATION SO THIS SOMEBODY

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:48.546
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY IS IN

00:30:48.613 --> 00:30:49.314
QUESTION IF SOMEBODY'S ALREADY

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.116
REGISTERED I'M A MOTIVATIONAL

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.117
ANY FURTHER CHANGES THAT'S AN

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.053
OPT OUT THAT SAYS I'M

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:57.455

WHAT I BUT I'M HAVING YET SOME

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.525
CHALLENGE OVER THE ANALYSIS AND

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:01.960
SOME CHALLENGE HERE ABOUT WHAT

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.394
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO THIS

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:05.230
HAS BEEN A LARGER DISCUSSION

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:06.898
OVER MANY YEARS AS TO WHETHER

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.166
THERE'S FRAUD AND ALL THOSE

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.901
ISSUES AND WE CAN CITE BUT

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:12.103
THOSE THINGS ALL DAY LONG. BUT

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.004
WHAT I GATHER FROM YOU IS THAT

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.806
WE NEED A FOURTH BOX AS THE

00:31:14.872 --> 00:31:16.207
CHAIRMAN SAID THE JUST SIMPLY

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.842
SAYS I'M ALREADY REGISTERED

CHECK THAT BOX IS A ONE. MAKE

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:34.792
SURE OF WAS ACCURATE THAT'S

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:41.065

I DIDN'T CHECK THIRD BOX THAT'S

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:50.408

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:51.876
GET TO WHAT YOU PURPOSES HERE

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.178

I'M ALREADY REGISTERED BECAUSE

00:31:56.347 --> 00:31:58.916
THE IDEA HERE THE OPT OUT WOULD

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:00.885
HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.987
PEOPLE REGISTERING AND THERE'S

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.422

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.674
THE PARTICIPATION OF THE

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.376
ANYBODY'S AGAINST THAT WHAT I

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.545
WANT IS CLARITY HERE IN TERMS

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.881
OF WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SEEKING

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:37.555

I'VE GONE KIND OF FULL CIRCLE

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:49.667
ON IT CENTER HERTZBERG BECAUSE

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.501
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THE FIRST

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.569
THING THE SCREENSHOT SAYS TO

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.970
YOU UNDER STATE LAW ELIGIBLE-

00:32:53.037 --> 00:32:54.539

OUT BUT AS I LOOKED AT IT I

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:06.918
THOUGHT FIRST OF ALL THE

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.453
CONCERN WAS DO I REALLY WANT

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:09.420

REGISTERED SO THAT WAS THE

00:33:17.495 --> 00:33:19.931
GENESIS OF LET'S HAPPEN OFTEN

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:22.400
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU.ARE

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.469

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:33.111
A VERSA BUT WHEN I LOOKED AT IT

00:33:33.177 --> 00:33:34.746
AND KEPT LOOKING AT IT REALIZE

00:33:34.812 --> 00:33:36.080
THANKS AND FOR THE A PHYSICALLY

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.382
TO PAGE TWO IT'S CERTAINLY A

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:42.053
SIMPLE FIX TO PUT A BOX IN THAT

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.390
REALLY DESCRIBES YOU. THAT YOU

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.492
EITHER CAN YOU DO NOT WANT TO

00:33:47.558 --> 00:33:48.826

00:33:57.034 --> 00:34:00.705
WANT VOTE SHE DOUBLED. SHE DOES

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:04.008
TO VOTE AND APPARENTLY CHECK

00:34:04.075 --> 00:34:07.011
THAT BOX STILL GOT RED. SO HOW

DO YOU FIX THAT WILL BE IT'S

00:34:07.845 --> 00:34:10.181
CONFUSING BUT IF YOU HAVE A BOX

FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.417
REGISTERED IN. ITALY ARE AND

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:13.651

MORE BOX WHAT THAT'S WHERE I

EVOLVED TO THAT. LET'S JUST PUT

ANOTHER BOX IN THERE AND THAT

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.624
WAY WE CAN AT LEAST MAKE THE

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.325
SYSTEM START TO WORK THE WAY IT

00:34:21.392 --> 00:34:22.393
WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED. DON'T

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.861
WANT TO VOTE YOU GOT A BOX FOR

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.630
THAT. THE ONE TO BE REGISTERED

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.598

REGISTERED PUT A BOX AND FOR

00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:30.835
THAT AND PLEASE DON'T. EDIT OR

CHANGE OUR HOW WE STOP

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:35.606
INFORMATION FROM THE DIEM BEING

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:36.908
GOING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE

00:34:36.974 --> 00:34:39.377
THAT IS REALLY A FOUR ISSUE.

00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:40.745
ARE THAT'S A PRIVACY ISSUE

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.647
PROBABLY ANOTHER FULL THING

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:44.649
BECAUSE THE BILL ACTUALLY THE

00:34:44.715 --> 00:34:45.616
A. B. FIFTEEN THIRTY WONDER

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:46.417
REMEMBER THE NUMBER RIGHT

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:49.854
ACTUALLY REQUIRED. EVERYBODY TO

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:53.858
BE REGISTERED OUGHT UNLESS THEY

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.860
AFFIRMATIVELY SAID DO NOT

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:59.597
REGISTER AND I THINK THERE'S A

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.499
QUESTION ABOUT FORCING PEOPLE

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.935
TO BE JUST. ANOTHER ISSUE BUT

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.036
THAT'S WHAT STARTED WITH. THE

00:35:05.102 --> 00:35:07.472
OP. RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA FIFTY

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.006
ASK FOR THE PRIME RATE. OUR I

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:10.007
WILL TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THIS

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.342
BILL THAT ADDS A FOURTH BULLET

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.344
ON THE SCREEN SHOT I DON'T KNOW

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:17.381
THAT THAT'S- VERY DIFFICULT

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:21.118
VERY EXPENSIVE. I'M NOT

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:24.155
COMPUTER WIZARD BUT WITH SEEM

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:27.658
TO BE A- PART OF OUR OWN.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:30.495
DOCUMENT HE QUIT WE ARE NOT A

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.530
GOOD FOR THE- INSURANCE

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:35.233
USUALLY. IS BECAUSE I SEE KIND

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.934
OF FINISHES IF YOU'RE SAYING I

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:41.105
DON'T TRUST THE D. M. V. WITH

THIS. MISSION THE TRUCK. THAT'S

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:49.714
A DIFFERENT. A WITH HAVING THE

DMV ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS IS

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:52.383
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.085
LONG TIME OKAY WITH THAT. I

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.186
DON'T THINK THE RISK IS REALLY

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:57.922
THAT BIG. IN TERMS IN TERMS OF

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.124

ANYTHING BASED ON YOUR-

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:07.884
ARGUMENTS MAYBE SOME.

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:10.220
AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY WHAT

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:11.455
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:12.856
THINK THIS BILL SHOULD MOVE

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.192
FORWARD WE SHOULD BE. ASSISTING

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:17.594
OUR CONSTITUENTS IN A POSITIVE

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:20.297
WAY TO MAKE VOTING AND VOTER

REGISTRATIONS MUCH MORE

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.333

PERSONAL PRIVILEGE IF I COULD.

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.346
I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE IS

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:38.615
BEEN RECEIVED BY THE SECRETARY

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.684
OF STATE'S OFFICE I THINK THAT

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:42.185
THEY I DIDN'T REALIZE AS YOU

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.387

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:57.100
TODAY HAVE THE SECRETARY STATE

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:57.668
TAKE A LOOK AT THERE'S SOME

00:48:57.734 --> 00:49:00.037
CONFUSION. A FIX IT AND BUT

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:01.438
ULTIMATELY FOCUSES WHICH IS MY

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:04.541
FOCUS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:06.076

POSSIBLE I THINK THAT WOULD BE

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:11.281
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION. IS

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.549
SOMETIMES LEGISLATION ISN'T

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.017
ALWAYS THE ANSWER YOU'VE GOT

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:19.122

YOU THAT CAN MAKE THE CHANGE

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:21.658
PRETTY QUICKLY THANK YOU. THE

00:49:21.725 --> 00:49:25.696
LAST. THEY DID HAVE THIS BEFORE

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:27.197
US YES IT IS WELCOME THAT SAID-

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.265
I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE SOME

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:30.367
GROUNDS FOR AMENDMENTS THAT

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:31.768
BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET THEM

00:49:31.835 --> 00:49:34.304
BEFORE US TODAY BUT I WOULD

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.605
MOVE THE BILL THAT WE MIGHT

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.174
MOVE IT ALONG AND HAVE A

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.476
AUTHORS WORK WITH THE CHAIR

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:41.111
TOWARDS SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.112
OF THE SUGGESTION TO YOU OF AND

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:44.781
I THINK THAT HAS MERIT AT LEAST

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.616
SO I WOULD MOVE THE BILL TO

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:49.353
KEEP IT ALIVE FOR THAT PURPOSE.

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.320
THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN I THINK

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.021
THERE'S A NUMBER DIFFERENT

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.689
CONST FLOAT AROUND ONE IS THE

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:53.790
ISSUE OF THOSE WHO ARE

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:55.592
INELIGIBLE TO VOTE ACTUALLY

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.694
REGISTERING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

GOING TO THE DMV THE SECOND IS

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:04.768
PEOPLE BEING USED AT AND THE

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.537
THIRD IS. WHAT WE ARE NOT THERE

TRYING TO MISTER WHO ARE TRYING

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.043
TO FRAUD THE SYSTEM. IN TERMS

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:13.643
OF THE ISSUE OF CONFUSION- I

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.345
THINK I'M GLAD YOU RACES I

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:16.480
DON'T THINK THE BILL DOES THAT

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:17.714
I THINK THE BILL IS AN OPT IN

00:50:17.781 --> 00:50:20.650
OPT OUT KIND OF THING- BUT BUT

00:50:20.717 --> 00:50:22.285
