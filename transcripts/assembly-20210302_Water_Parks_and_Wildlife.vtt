EXAMINATION OF ALL THE CENSUS

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:12.128
TRACTS- SHOW THAT. I'M HAVING

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:15.732
PARKS AND TREE CANOPY NEED. WAS

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.967
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LIFE

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:23.373
EXPECTANCY TO ME THAT'S A CALL.

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:26.042
TO ACCESS TO. NATURE IS A TOOL

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.410
TO ADDRESS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:31.147
HEALTH DISPARITIES AND A STUDY

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.549
LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE UNITED.

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:37.053
KINGDOM. CENSUS SHOWED THAT

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.222
EXPOSURE TO GREEN STATING

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:43.526
IMPACT OF POVERTY ON.

00:57:43.593 --> 00:57:46.529
CARDIOVASCULAR THE DISEASE AND

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:50.066
THAT'S RIGHT IN TEENS- SO IN

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:54.137
OUR GROUP M. AT UCSF WE DID A

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.239
NATIONAL SURVEY WE LOOKED AT A

00:57:56.306 --> 00:57:58.741
NATIONAL SURVEY STATES AND WE

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:01.511
SAW THAT WHILE ONLY AROUND 25%

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:02.979
ACTUALLY THAT'S PRETTY HIGH OF

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.081
CHILDREN HAD REPORTED NO ACCESS

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.050
TO PARKS THOSE WHO SAID THEY

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.785
HAD NO ACCESS TO PARKS WERE

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:13.089
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NO.

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:13.656
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PER WEEK.

00:58:13.723 --> 00:58:14.791
MORE THAN FOUR OF DAILY SCREEN

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:16.526
TIME THIS WAS BEFORE THE

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:20.296
PANDEMIC- AND INADEQUATE SLEEP.

00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:22.398
AND THEY WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY.

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:24.067
TO BE OVERWEIGHT OR TO HAVE AN

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.302
ADHD DIAGNOSIS. THE THING

00:58:26.369 --> 00:58:28.004
THAT'S REALLY A CALL TO ACTION

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.339
OUT FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORLD

00:58:29.405 --> 00:58:32.208
IS THAT- EXPOSURE TO NATURE IS

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.510
ALSO ONE OF THE METHODS WE

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.913
HAVE. TO DECREASE THE SPREAD OF

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.682
KUWAIT- SO FIRST OF ALL

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.284
EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING THAT

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:43.753
NATURE CAN HELP HELP US GET

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:45.822
THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:47.624
IMPACTS OF ISOLATION A SURVEY

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.492
OF THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN.

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:53.062
JAPAN SHOW THAT HAVING A ROOM

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:56.566
THAT HAS YOU WOULD NEED. SURE

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.268
OR HAVE VISITS TO NATURE DURING

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.169
THE PANDEMIC IMPROVEMENT. SO

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:01.471
HAVE PERMITS THAT CENTERS IN

00:59:01.537 --> 00:59:03.373
THE UNITED STATES SHOW THAT.

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:04.908
THERE WAS LESS DISCREPANCY

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:10.280
BETWEEN RACES IN KOBE- RATES SO.

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.949
THE RACIAL DISPARITY THAT WE'VE

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.885
SEEN IN KOBE WHAT'S LESS IN

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.720
AREAS THAT HAD MORE GREEN. AND

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:18.721
THEN MY GROUP THAT A META

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:21.024
ANALYSIS LOOKING AT MORE THAN

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.458
TEN THOUSAND PAPERS TO SEE

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.360
WHERE COKE IT WAS TRANSMITTED

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:26.329
AND WE SAW THAT LESS THAN 10%

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.264
OF ALL GLOBAL COATED

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.599
TRANSMISSIONS OCCURRED

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:32.769
OUTDOORS.AND AT THE RATE OF IT

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:34.170
THE CHANCE OF GETTING CLOBBERED

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.372
OUTDOORS IS ABOUT TWENTY TIMES

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:38.174
LESS THAN IT IS INDOORS AND SO

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:40.810
IN COMBINATION WITH MASKS AND

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:43.680
DISTANCE AND LESS DENSITY.

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:46.349
BEING OUTDOORS IS ACTUALLY AN

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:48.751
INFECTION CONTROL MEASURE. SO

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:51.521
ALL THIS TO SAY AS YOU ALREADY

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:54.057
KNEW ACCESS TO NATURE IS AN

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:56.826
IMPORTANT PART OF HEALTH- AND

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.462
WE IN PUBLIC HEALTH SHOULD BE

00:59:59.529 --> 01:00:01.764
HELPING YOU INCREASE PHYSICAL

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:04.300
ACCESS TO NATURE BUT WE ALL

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.069
HAVE TO KNOW AS A GROUP THAT

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.171
JUST HAVING NATURE NEAR YOU IS

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:12.642
NOT ENOUGH- AS WE NOTE. THAT

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:15.411
THE- NATURE IS NOT EQUITABLY

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.779
DISTRIBUTED IN THE UNITED

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:18.181
STATES NOT HEARD THAT FROM THE

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.416
PREVIOUS SPEAKER BUT EVEN WHEN

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:23.052
PEOPLE LIVE NEAR NATURE IF IT'S

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:25.621
NOT ASAFE PLACE. THEY WILL NOT

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.857
SPEND TIME IN IT- AND WE HAVE

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:29.592
ALL BEEN WITNESSED THIS YEAR

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:31.627
AND IN THE PAST TO REALLY

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:35.231
pAGAINST. PEOPLE IN THE BLACK

FACT OF BEING OUTSIDE. AND ACTS

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:49.946
LIKE THAT THEY ARE HORRIFIC AND

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:52.181
THEY ARE ALSO SOCIAL SIGNALS.

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:56.085
TO FAMILIES NOT TO BE OUTDOORS

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:56.786
AND NOT TO BE IN NATURE. AND

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:59.188
SURFACE ACCESS IS ONE THING.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:00.957
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO WORK HRD

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.692
ON MAKING THESE SPACES RACISM

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:04.627
FREE AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:05.762
FAMILIES FEEL A SENSE OF

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:08.097
OWNERSHIP AND BEING OUTDOORS.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.600
AND IN THE CONTEXT OF COVE IT

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:12.301
THESE TRAGEDIES AND INEQUITIES

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.103
ARE SUPER DISTRESSING BECAUSE

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.271
THE RIGHT TO BE PHYSICALLY

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:18.074
ACTIVE AND TO PLAY AND TO BE IN

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.576
COMMUNITY OUTDOORS. IS ONE OF

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:21.811
THE WAYS THAT WE WILL HEAL.

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:25.248
PANDEMIC SO IN THE LAST FEW

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.616
MINUTES I'M JUST GOING TO SHARE

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:27.917
WITH YOU SOME STORIES THAT I'VE

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.053
BEEN HEARING FROM MY PATIENTS I

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:33.589
HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO WHAT IS

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.525
CLEARLY AN INCREASE IN PARK

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:38.728
VISITOR **** BUT THE KIDS THAT

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.598
I WORK WITH- ARE NOT. I DON'T

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:43.666
SEE THEM REFLECTED IN THOSE

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.936
NUMBERS SO WE- HAVE BEEN DOING

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.271
INTERVIEWS WITH THE FAMILIES

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.972
THAT WE SERVE IN THIS URBAN

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:53.176
CLINIC- AND THESE ARE SOME OF

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:53.743
THE QUOTES THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.312
SAID. THERE ARE SOME CITY PARKS

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.380
THAT ARE WITHIN WALKING

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.748
DISTANCE BUT THEY'RE UNDER

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.951
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW OF. IN

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.554
WHAT WILL WORK BEST JUST TOOK

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:07.223
ONE PLAY. REALLY THE ONLY TIME

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.358
IT UPSIDE. DOWN THE BLOCK AND

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:13.696
I'M THE ONLY JESSICA GB DUE. TO

01:02:13.763 --> 01:02:14.363
VIOLENT CRIMES THAT WAS A MONTH.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.565
AND I WISH THERE COULD BE MORE

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.366
THINGS FOR CHILDREN TO DO THAT

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.635
ARE SAFE AND HEALTHY FOR THEM.

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.571
AND THAT THEY FELT ENGAGEMENT.

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:24.574
AND JOY AND I WISH IT WOULD

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.210
COULD BE CLOSER IT WASN'T SUCH

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:27.743
A CHALLENGE FOR US TO GET

01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.513
ACCESS TO IT. REGIONAL PARKS

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.347
ARE ALL FAR AWAY FROM WHERE

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.949
WE'RE LIVING. WE DON'T HAVE A

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.951
CAR. AND SINCE THE PANDEMIC

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.385
STARTED THEY'VE CUT DOWN ON BUS

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.887
ROUTES AND SUSPENDED A LOT OF

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:40.056
SERVICES. NOBODY'S COMING TO

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.457
GIVE US A RIDE ANYWHERE R TO

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:43.059
HELP US IN ANY WAY THAT'S

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:45.194
ANOTHER MONTH. I MISS GOING

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.130
OUTSIDE. SOMETIMES I HAVE

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.531
DREAMS ABOUT PLAYING IN NATURE

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:50.700
WITH MY STUFFED ANIMALS. AND

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:53.469
THEY COME TO LIFE. THEY CAN

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:54.403
MOVE AND WALK AND TALKON THEIR

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.907
OWN. THAT'S A SEVEN YEAR OLD. I

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.509
WISH I HAD A BACKYARD BECAUSE

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:00.977
THEN WE COULD GO OUTSIDE AND

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.179
ENJOY BEING IN NATURE. TO HAVE

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.681
GRASS UNDER YOUR FEET BEING OUT

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.016
THERE WITH THE WIND BLOWING.

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.217
IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN SITTING

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:09.719
ON THE PORCH LOOKING AT CARS

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:12.321
DRIVING BY WHICH IS NOT ONE OF

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.723
OUR FAVORITE THINGS TO DO. I

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.991
WISH THAT CODE IT DIDN'T MAKE A

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:16.893
SO CONFINED BECAUSE I THINK

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.928
THAT BY CUT CLOSING US OFF FROM

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.897
NATURE YOU'VE ALSO CLOSED US

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.999
OFF. FROM A PART OF WHO WE ARE

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.801
AS PEOPLE. AND AS A COMMUNITY

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.236
IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:28.304
IN NATURE AND FEEL LIKE THERE'S

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.705
SOMETHING TO DO BESIDES BEING

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.707
COOKED COOKED AT HOME UP. AT

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.377
HOME SORRY I GET EMOTIONAL.

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.778
TAKING THAT AWAY IS HURTING

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.713
PEOPLE MORE THAN IT'S HELPING.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.248
EVEN THOUGH WE WANT TO PROTECT

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.217
EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON NATURE

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.318
PROVIDES ITS OWN PROTECTION AS

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.253
WELL. BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.789
AWAY. SO WE NEED TO FIND A

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.591
HEALTHY WAY TO DO IT. AND I

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.026
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.561
HEARING ESPECIALLY FROM

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.095
FAMILIES WHO HAVE CHILDREN WITH

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:56.299
SPECIAL NEEDS. OR TEENAGERS

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:56.899
THAT THEY ARE REALLY SUFFERING

01:03:56.966 --> 01:04:01.370
AT HOME. SO WHAT DO WE DO. I

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.539
WANT TO SAY THAT AS PUBLIC

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:05.675
HEALTH PROVIDERS PEOPLE WHO

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:08.511
CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:11.614
CONTROL OF CLUB AT NINETEEN. I

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.815
FOR ONE AM HERE STANDING WITH

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.483
YOU WITH MY SLEEVES ROLLED UP

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:17.553
TO SAY THAT SHELTER IN PLACE

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.154
DOES NOT HAVE TO MEAN SHELTER

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:21.691
INSIDE. AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.227
HELP YOU MANAGE THIS. INFLUX OF

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.895
PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE HAVING

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:28.531
BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO AND

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.399
WE NEED YOU TO STAY OPEN. WHEN

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.934
I SEE PICTURES OF LOTS OF

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.402
PEOPLE IN THE PARK I THINK

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:35.004
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE

01:04:35.071 --> 01:04:36.305
THAT'S IN PLACE OF LOTS OF

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.908
PEOPLE INSIDE SPREADING MORE

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:39.475
COPE WITH AND THEY WOULD IF

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.110
THEY WERE OUTSIDE. PEOPLE

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.478
HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR FAMILIES FOR

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.680
MORE THAN A YEAR. I WOULD MUCH

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:46.382
RATHER AN EXTENDED FAMILY SPEND

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.451
TIME IN THE PARK. THEN IN THEIR

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:51.621
HOME. THE RISK OF COVERT IS

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:54.123
LOWER OUTDOORS AND- I FOR ONE

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:55.558
WOULD EVEN BE HAPPY SEEING

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.159
SCHOOLS USE PARKS TO GET

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.595
OUTDOORS. AND OTHER ESSENTIAL

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:03.099
SERVICES. HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:05.935
LANDS IN ORDER TO STAY OPEN.

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.036
THE SECOND THING THAT I THINK

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.405
WE CAN DO IS REALLY A LINE HOW

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:13.376
WE SPEAK ABOUT. TIME IN NATURE

01:05:13.442 --> 01:05:15.578
AND HOW COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.647
TIME IN NATURE. ACCESS TO

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:19.282
NATURE IS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:22.218
STANDING IN PARKS. HEALING IN

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:23.986
NATURE IS ABOUT PLAYING AND

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:25.788
BEING IN COMMUNITY AND FEELING

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:26.956
GONNA SHIP AND KNOWING THAT

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:31.193
YOUR SPACE AND PARKS. IS VALUED.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.162
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:35.164
RELATIONSHIP WITH NATURE FOR

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:37.533
ALL OF HUMANITY. BEING IN

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.368
NATURE RESONATES WHAT WITH ALL

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.704
OF US WHETHER TEACHING TEENS-

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.206
CELEBRATION OR IN MY COMMUNITY

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:46.509
PERSIAN NEW YEAR'S COMING UP

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.143
AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.211

YOU FROM LA KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:56.385
OKAY SO HOW CAN WE BE MOBILIZED

01:05:56.452 --> 01:05:58.854
TO CLEAN. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE A

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.189
LOVE OF NATURE AND I'M IN OUR

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:03.492
CULTURES. AND SO LET US HELP

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:04.126

THANK YOU THEY ARE IN CRISIS.

THERE'S NO SCHOOL FOR THEM

THERE'S NO VACCINE FOR THEM WE

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:45.681
SOMETIMES IS THE PATH OF LEAST

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.916
RESISTANCE WE CAN. PRESERVE

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.685
SOME SPACE YOU KNOW THE ONLY

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.286
WAY OUT OF URBAN AREAS IT MIGHT

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.088
BE EASIER TO DO THAT. TO BUY UP

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.223
MAYBE SOME FORMER RENTAL AND

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:55.891
THE MAKE IT OFFICE SPACE. IT'S

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:58.427
MUCH HARDER TO DO THE WORK EVEN

01:14:58.493 --> 01:15:00.229
OF OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES AND SO

01:15:00.295 --> 01:15:01.763
IS THERE A THOUGHT OR A PLAN OF

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.365
HOW WE CAN GO FORWARD. TO

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.933
PRIORITIZE IT EVEN THOUGH WE

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.871
KNOW THAT'S THE HARDER WORK.

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:09.872
THAT SOMETIMES ENDS UP. PUTTING

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.274
BEING IN THE- KIND OF THE END

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.175
OF THE LAST AND THEN AS OF NOW

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.643
GETTING DONE. BUT IF ANYONE

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.378
OTHER. TO GET BACK TO THAT WORK

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.779
SO A LONG WINDED WAY OF SAYING

01:15:17.846 --> 01:15:19.715
HOW TO BE FIRED. THESE INFILL

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:25.954
URBAN PARKS IN A PARK DESERT'S.

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.322

STATE BECAUSE I DO THINK. THAT

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.123
A PART OF THE VALUE HERE IS

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.891
GIVING ALL THE STUDENTS AND-

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:24.259

IN THE PUBLIC LANDS WORLD OF.

01:19:30.065 --> 01:19:31.466
THE MOST INCREDIBLE STATE IN

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:34.336
THE NATION CALIFORNIA. I

LEAST RESISTANCE TO BE ONE THAT

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.580
GOES BACK TO THE NORM BECAUSE

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:46.481
THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE FOR A

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.216
VERY LONG TIME. AND I WOULD

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:49.384
JUST SAY THE LAST COMMENTS ON

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.819
GRANT PROGRAMS I KNOW THE VERY

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:52.220
TOP THIS IS TALKED ABOUT IN

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.788
TERMS OF CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT BY

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.257
ASKING WHAT HAVE YOU BUT YOU

ARE WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES

01:19:58.860 --> 01:19:59.694
AND YES THE PROPERTY VALUE

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:01.696
MIGHT BE HIGHER. BUT YOU HAVE

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:02.564
YET TO THREE FAMILIES AGAIN AND

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.132
A HOME AND THEY DON'T HAVE

PARTS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.536
SO THERE CAN BE WAYS AS WE LOOK

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:08.737
AT THESE GRANT PROGRAMS TO

01:20:08.803 --> 01:20:10.639
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT EVEN

PROPERTY VALUE AREA THAT

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.244
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.879
FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS. SO WE CAN

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.182
NARROW DOWN AND TAKE A CLOSER

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:25.520

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:16.538
DOWN THERE HOW. USED ARE STATE

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.540
PARKS FACILITIES ARE. ON TOP OF

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:19.507
THAT WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THE

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.276
IMPACTS THAT WERE FEARING UNDER

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:22.510
CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO DIRECTOR

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:24.112
CAN TERRA WAS WONDERING IF YOU

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:25.814
COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:26.781
WHAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS DOING

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:29.651
NOW- TO DETERMINE WHAT SEA

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.519
LEVEL RISE MIGHT MEAN TO MANY

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.821
OF OUR STATE PARKS AND THE

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:35.090
FACILITIES THAT ARE THERE- ANY

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:40.662
PLANS OF ACTIONS TO BE ABLE TO.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:41.296
ADOPT OR TO MITIGATE FOR THAT.

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:42.063
THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR THAT. IS

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:44.366
THAT MEMBERS TAKE PART IS JEFF.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.934
FINISHED A SEA LEVEL RISE

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.636
ADAPTATIONS ADAPTATION

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.437
STRATEGY. AND IT LAYS OUT A

01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:51.940
ROADMAP. TO BUILD A RAPPER NOW

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.975
TO RESPONSE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.710
OR THE COASTAL STATE PARK UNITS

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.979
ALL ALONG THE COAST STATE PARKS

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.981
ACTUALLY MANAGES OVER THREE

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.283
HUNDRED MILES. OF THE COASTLINE

01:22:01.349 --> 01:22:03.318
OF CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS A VERY

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:05.220
CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ALL OF US.

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:06.821
AND SOMEBODY IDENTIFIED ACTIONS

01:22:06.888 --> 01:22:08.256
ARE ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:11.259
FOR EXAMPLE. OR SOME OF THE-

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:11.960
ACTIONS ARE ALREADY BEING

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.795
IDENTIFIED AND WE'RE ALSO

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:16.231
PRIORITY PRIORITIZING OTHERS AS

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:17.866
WE WERE ABLE TO GET FUNDING.

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:19.934
PARTNERSHIPS AND ADDITIONAL

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.804
ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY- YOUR

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.606
QUESTION IS PARTICULARLY

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.974
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:27.742
DOING IN OUR ADAPTATION

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:29.678
STRATEGY IS LOOKING. TO WHAT

01:22:29.744 --> 01:22:31.513
KINDS OF ACTIONS DO WE NEED TO

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:32.947
TAKE NOW IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.416
SEA LEVEL RISE OF SAY THREE

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:37.152
FEET OVER THE NEXT FORTY YEARS.

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.219
AND IT REALLY MAKES A

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.754
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE KINDS

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:42.624
OF PROJECTS THAT WE IMPLEMENT-

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:45.527
HOW WE MANAGE ACCESS AND HOW WE

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:46.928
LOOK AT THE SAUDIS AND ALL OF

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.830
THAT SO IT'S A- IT'S A VERY

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:50.799
HIGH PRIORITY FOR US AND I WILL

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:52.967
ALSO SAY. THAT WITH STATE PARKS

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.436
WE'RE WORKING WITH ORIGINATION

01:22:54.502 --> 01:22:56.404
LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCIES WERE

01:22:56.471 --> 01:22:58.640
ACTUALLY A MEMBER OF WAR WE

01:22:58.707 --> 01:22:59.407
WORK WITH A GROUP CALLED

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:00.675

NETWORK AND WHAT WE DO THERE IS

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.448
WE WORK WITH PARTNERS SO THAT

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:07.682
WE'RE NOT JUST WORKING IN A

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.517
POCKET IN ONE AREA WE'RE

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:11.152
WORKING AS A COLLECTIVE. WITH

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:13.054
OTHER LAND MANAGERS IN THE AREA

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.122
BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED TO BE

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:16.558

EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS. INTO

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.065
THESE PARTNERSHIPS I'VE SEEN.

BASICALLY A FORCE MULTIPLIER OF

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:29.104
KNOWLEDGE. OF RESOURCES IN

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.406
TERMS OF PEOPLE AND FUNDING AND

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:32.607

APART- WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.861
LANDS THAT MIGHT BE. AFFECTING

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.928
WELL THAT MIGHT BE AT RISK FOR

01:23:53.995 --> 01:23:55.897
SEA LEVEL RISE- TO BE ABLE TO

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.999
THICK AND MITIGATE OR ADAPT OUT

01:23:58.066 --> 01:23:58.767
FOR SOME OF THE WILDLIFE

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:03.104
PROGRAMS- AND THOSE IMPACTS WE

01:24:03.171 --> 01:24:05.373
EXPECT FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.742
THANK YOU. SUM OF MEMBER. WE

HIGHLIGHT THOSE. ARE AREAS OF

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:20.522
RESTORATION OR REMEDIATION. FOR

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.857
THOSE POTENTIAL HABITAT THAT

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:24.492
WOULD BE EITHER LOST OR ENTER

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:27.395
DATED AS C. LEVEL RISE OCCURS.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.464
WE'RE ALSO WORKING AS DIRECTOR

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.366
CAN TERO TALKED ABOUT THE

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:33.368
LANDSCAPE SCALE PARTNERSHIP

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:37.572
WITH CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE- OUR-

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:44.312
PARTNERSHIP- THE- ISSUE IS. ALL

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:46.481
THIS WAS HIGH A LOT OF THESE-

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:48.316
WILDLIFE AREAS OR ECOLOGICAL

01:24:48.383 --> 01:24:52.720
RESERVES ARE- DOWN BY URBAN

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:55.356
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE'S NOT A

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:58.193
LOT OF ROOM TO GO WHERE THE SEA

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.662
LEVEL RISES AND WE CAN USE SOME

01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.163
OF THE IN LINE BECAUSE I MEAN

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.299
THE COASTAL LAGOON HABITATS

01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:06.734
THAT ARE SO ESSENTIAL FOR

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:08.369
CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:11.973
BIODIVERSITY- WHAT HAPPENS AS

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.142
THE SEA LEVEL RISE IS. AND

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.845
INTIMIDATION OCCURS- UPWARD IN

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.947
THE CHANNEL SO WE NEED TO BE

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:21.583
THINKING ABOUT STRATEGIC

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:24.185
RESTORATION OR REMEDIATION

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:26.554
PROJECTS WITHIN THE FOOTPRINT

PROPERTIES TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.997
HABITATS ARE MAINTAINED. AND I

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:38.500
THINK THAT IT'S A IT'S A BIG

01:25:38.566 --> 01:25:42.003
LEFT- WORKING ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.404
AGENCIES WHETHER IT'S THE

STATE AGENCIES THAT MANAGE

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:54.415
THOSE HABITATS SO IT'S

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:56.150
BASICALLY EVERYBODY'S GOT A

01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:58.553
LEAD INTO THIS BECAUSE NO ONE

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.188

OUT THERE AND THEN THE NATIONAL

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:08.029
LANDSCAPE. HOW THE GULF COAST

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.265
COMMUNITIES IN FLORIDA AND THE

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.867
BARRIER ISLANDS ARE ADDRESSING

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:14.903
HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:18.740
LEVEL RISE WILL AFFECT CENTRAL-

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:20.675
CRITICAL WILDLIFE AND

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:24.479
ECOLOGICAL HABITATS- NECESSARY

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.114

THE TIJUANA RIVER ESTUARY IN

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.757
MISSION BAY AND OTHER SPACES

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:36.991

THIS A PANEL PRESENTATION.

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:08.756
LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:10.291
PANDEMIC AND OTHER CHALLENGES

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:11.693
THE PAST YEAR THE YOU DID NOT

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.728
HAVE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK ON

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:14.529
DURING YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD

LOVE TO HEAR. HOW YOUR YOUR

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:17.665
THOUGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES ON

THANK YOU. ON THIS SUBJECT IN

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:30.244
BATTLE TO START VERY QUICKLY

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.746
WHAT WE DID WITH THE PARKS AS

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:33.982
WE LOOK. AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.583
TO MAKE PARKS ACCESSIBLE TO THE

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.518
PUBLIC. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:38.720
STATED WE HAD TREMENDOUS

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.254
INCREASES IN PUBLIC VISITATION

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:42.156
APART. WELL WE HAD TO BE REALLY

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:44.826
CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:47.028
WERE PROTECTING FOLKS FROM-

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.396
ACTIVITIES IT COULD CREATE MORE

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.998
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTAMINATION

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.532
SO WE HAD TO DO THINGS LIKE

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.134
REMOVE PICNIC TABLES AND WE

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.068
MADE SURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE CAME

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:56.204
TO PARKS. THEY WERE INFORMED WE

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:57.505
SHOULD BE SIMPLY DISTANCE IS

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.706
USUALLY THE PATIENT KEEP

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.475
MOVING. AND WHAT WE DID IS WE

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.143
USE ALL THE FORMS OF MEDIA TO

01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.545
GET THE MESSAGE OUT. ON OUT

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:05.847
WHERE PEOPLE COULD GO WHAT

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:06.814
KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THEY COULD

01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:09.550
ENGAGE IN- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:28:09.617 --> 01:28:11.019
WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK. THE

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.687
GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE IN TERMS

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:14.489
OF STAYING AT HOME. AND

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.958
EMPLOYEES AND WE WORK WITH THE

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.526
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:21.162
MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE MAKE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.829
CHANGES RELATIVETO PUBLIC

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.165
ACCESS. ON AND HOW WE MANAGE

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.067
PUBLIC ACCESS TO PARKS WHAT IN

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:27.301
LINE WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:29.704
COUNTYWIDE. AND WHAT WE FOUND

01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:31.506
WAS INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:28:31.572 --> 01:28:34.442

ACTUALLY BENEFITED FROM THE

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:28.235
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE BUILT

01:33:28.302 --> 01:33:30.304
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS BETWEEN

DISTRICTS AND LAND MANAGERS

WERE REALLY RECEIVING MIXED

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:47.288
MESSAGES ABOUT WHAT TO DO- AND

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.423
SINCE WE STARTED MEETING FIRST

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:52.226
ON A WEEKLY BASIS- AND THEN WE

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.494
ACTUALLY ENDED UP PUTTING

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:55.129
TOGETHER A SERIES OF THREE

01:33:55.196 --> 01:33:55.997
WEAPON ARTISTS WITH

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:58.232
EPIDEMIOLOGIST. AND INFECTIOUS

01:33:58.299 --> 01:33:59.967
DISEASES PEOPLE GIVING

01:34:00.034 --> 01:34:02.236
INFORMATION TO PEOPLE IN PARKS

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:04.372
BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED REALLY

01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:05.840
PEOPLE PARKS ARE VERY MUCH ON

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.441
THE FRONT LINES OF DEALING WITH

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:10.745
THE PANDEMIC AND- PUBLIC HEALTH

01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:11.812
POLICIES WHICH WERE NOT

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.881
HAPPENING IN A REGION WHERE

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:16.650
WE'RE THROWING UP PARK

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:18.652
MINISTRY- SOFT BECAUSE THEN THE

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.521
POLICIES OF ONE COUNTY WOULD

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.823
IMPACT- YOU KNOW IT WOULD LEAD

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:24.792
PEOPLE TO ALL FLOCK TO ANOTHER

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.895
COUNTY'S. IF BUT PARKS IN ONE

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:29.663
DISTRICT WERE CLOSED AND SO WE

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.165
REALLY TRY TO HELP CREATE

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:33.701
CONSISTENT MESSAGING AND TO BE

01:34:33.768 --> 01:34:35.403
GENERALIZATION FROM THE HEALTH

01:34:35.469 --> 01:34:38.572
SIDE TO PARKS AND I THINK THAT

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:41.342
THE U. INVITING ME TO THIS AND-

01:34:41.409 --> 01:34:43.444
MORE INTO YOU KNOW IF WE CAN DO

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.079
THE SAME AND HAVE MORE INTO HER

01:34:45.146 --> 01:34:48.082
DISCIPLINARY- DISCUSSIONS WE

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:50.184
REALLY WILL BE PREPARED FOR.

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:51.919
THE NEXT PANDEMIC WHICH I AGREE

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:54.121
IS COMING AS WELL AS THE IMPACT

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:57.525
OF CLIMATE CHANGE- I THINK THAT

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.359
PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:59.994
OUTDOORS AND PEOPLE THAT WORK

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.395
IN PARKS ARE ARE ACTUALLY

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.564
FACING VERY MUCH ARE VERY

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:05.433
SIMILAR ISSUES AND WE ARE BOTH

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:07.768
VERY IMPACTED BY INEQUITY

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:10.171
BECAUSE INEQUITY DRIVES. A LOT

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:11.405
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IN

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:18.679
HEALTH AND I'M SURE THAT IT.

01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:19.246
DRIVES A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.082
THAT YOU SEE. I MEAN CAN FOR

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.984
OUT PARKS WHY- AND- BUT I'D

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.886
START THE WHOLE SO AND I'M- NH

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.555
AS PART OF OPTIMA. WE HAVE A

01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:29.223
VACCINE WHICH IS LIKE

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.192
UNBELIEVABLE WE SHOULD ALL BE

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:32.960
REALLY CELEBRATING THAT IT'S A-

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.329
GREAT THING- AND I HOPE THAT

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.263
OUR DISCIPLINES CAN WORK

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:38.999
TOGETHER TO. MAKE THE SUCCESS-

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:41.802
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL- YOU DON'T

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:44.004
FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:46.273
ALL POPULATIONS CAN TRUST. AND

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.875
THAT PARK FOLKS WHO ARE

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:49.176
ESSENTIAL WORKERS HAVE ACCESS

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:52.847
TO IT- AND SO I THINK REALLY

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:54.615
FOR ME IT'S THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.851
BUILT BETWEEN. THESE VERY

01:35:56.917 --> 01:36:00.821
DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES CARING

01:36:00.888 --> 01:36:01.455
FOR THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE ON THE

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.390
PLANET- THAT WE QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:36:03.457 --> 01:36:05.126
LIED AND LEANED INTO AND THE

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.627
TRUTH WE WILL NEED TO KEEP

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:10.965

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.238
QUITE A BIT OF CONCERN GIVEN

01:42:58.305 --> 01:42:59.439
THE PANDEMIC ABOUT THE STATE'S

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:02.576
FISCAL CONDITION- DESPITE THAT

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:03.544
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT GENERAL

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.879
FUND. APPROPRIATION PROVIDED TO

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.681
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A STATE

01:43:07.748 --> 01:43:09.483
PARKS AND OTHER PROGRAMS SO IT%

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.685
JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE ONE WAS

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:12.619
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT CONCERNED

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:16.123
ABOUT. POTENTIAL LOST REVENUES

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:17.524
FOR STATE PARKS BECAUSE OF

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:18.525
REDUCED VISITOR SHIP AN

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:20.661
ACTIVITY- SO THE LEGISLATURE

01:43:20.727 --> 01:43:22.095
APPROVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.697
MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.299
TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN BACK FILL

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:27.801
ANY LOST REVENUES- I BELIEVE

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:30.003
THE MOST RECENT UPDATE IS THAT.

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.538
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:43:31.605 --> 01:43:32.839
ANTICIPATE WE WON'T NEED THE

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.308
FULL ONE HUNDRED FIFTY IT MIGHT

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:35.275
BE MORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.578
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY- ALTHOUGH

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:39.813
THAT'S NOT YET. FINAL IN

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.248
ADDITION THE CURRENT BUDGET

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.450
ALREADY ENACTED INCLUDED TWENTY

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:46.053
MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:46.520
EIGHTY TWO OH NINE BY

THAT LOCATION THAT PARK. AND

01:44:05.839 --> 01:44:06.607
NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. I'M IN

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:07.941

OPEN SPACE AND I JUST WANNA

01:44:14.715 --> 01:44:16.717
HIGHLIGHT ONE IN PARTICULAR-

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.352
WHICH IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.120
ONE BILLION DOLLAR WHILE FILER

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:22.022
FIRE RESILIENCY PACKAGE. THAT'S

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.690
IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE NOW

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:24.691
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT FUNDING

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:27.761
PROPOSED FOR FOREST HEALTH.

01:44:27.828 --> 01:44:30.564
ACTIVITIES TO- REDUCE THE

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:32.633
POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LAW I'LL

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.368
FIRED OWNERS ON OUR STATE LAND

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:36.470
SO THAT INCLUDES. EIGHTY FIVE

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.304
MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU SEE

01:44:37.371 --> 01:44:38.672
HERE IN THE HAND OUT SPECIFIC

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:40.374
FOR STATE PARKS- BUT THERE'S

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.775
ALSO FUNDING FOR SIMILAR

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:44.044
ACTIVITIES. AT THE DEPARTMENT

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:47.347
OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- ALSO

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:48.448
STAYED ON THE LAND. AND OWNED

01:44:48.515 --> 01:44:50.417
BY THE- A STATE LANDS

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:51.351
COMMISSION IN TALLINN

01:44:51.418 --> 01:44:53.086
CONSERVANCY IS WELL SO THAT'S A

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:54.221
MAJOR NEW INVESTMENT I THINK A

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:56.356
RECOGNITION THAT THE STATE HAS

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:57.157
NOT INVESTED IN THOSE

01:44:57.224 --> 01:44:59.359
ACTIVITIES ADEQUATELY IN PAST

01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:03.163
YEARS. AND I'LL NOTE TO THAT-

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.531
POURTANT FEDERAL LEGISLATION

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:07.334
RECENTLY LAST YEAR THE FEDERAL

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:08.268
CONGRESSMEN AND PRESIDENTS

01:45:08.335 --> 01:45:10.771
SIGNED- THE GREAT OUTDOORS ACT

01:45:10.837 --> 01:45:13.473
WHICH PROVIDES- SORT OF LOCKS

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.975
IN A HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED

01:45:15.042 --> 01:45:17.544
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.546
STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL PARKS

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:22.315
THE ANTICIPATION I BELIEVE IS

01:45:22.382 --> 01:45:23.817
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:25.452
WILL RE RECEIVE MAYBE IN THE

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.688
NEIGHBORHOOD OF AN ADDITIONAL

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:28.288
FOURTEEN OR SO MILLION DOLLARS

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:32.993
ANNUALLY. FROM THAT PROGRAM.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.662
LASTLY IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:36.897
OF THE HANDOUT JUST WANNA

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:39.066
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE SORT OF

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:42.002
FISCAL CHALLENGES THAT.

01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:42.569
CONFRONT THE LEGISLATURE AS

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:45.138
YOU. CONSIDER THE DIFFERENT

01:45:45.205 --> 01:45:47.107
ISSUES DIFFERENT CHALLENGES IN

01:45:47.174 --> 01:45:49.076
PROVIDING ADEQUATE PARKING OPEN

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:51.411
SPACE- TO COMMUNITIES. THE

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:54.181
FIRST IS THAT WE KNOW EVEN WITH

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:57.884
OUR EXISTING LANDS- THAT. WE

01:45:57.951 --> 01:45:59.986
HAVE CHALLENGES MANAGING THEM

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:01.922
THAT INCLUDES BOTH- FOR EXAMPLE

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:03.523
STATE PARKS AND FISH AND

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.125
WILDLIFE DEPARTMENTS HAVE

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:06.560
UNDERGONE WITH THEY'VE REFERRED

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:07.627
TO SERVICE BASED BUDGETING

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.663
ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.566
DEFICIENCIES AND MEETING THEIR

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:14.434
EXISTING OBLIGATIONS. WE KNOW

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:15.702
THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:17.170
AMOUNTS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:18.705
FOR EXAMPLE ON STATE

01:46:18.772 --> 01:46:20.841
FACILITIES. AND IN ADDITION

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:23.043
YOU'VE HEARD SOME CONVERSATION

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.078
ALREADY ABOUT INCREASING RISKS

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:27.114
TO OUR EXISTING STATE LANDS DUE

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:28.215
TO CLIMATE CHANGE WEATHER

01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:30.450
WILDFIRE SEALEVEL RISE OR

01:46:30.517 --> 01:46:32.819
OTHER. CHALLENGES BUT IN

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.821
ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGES

01:46:34.888 --> 01:46:36.223
MANAGING OUR EXISTING

01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:39.459
FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACE THERE

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:40.560
ARE OF COURSE THE CHALLENGE HE

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:41.862
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS

01:46:41.928 --> 01:46:43.396
THIS MORNING ALREADY WHICH ARE

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:46.500
THE CHALLENGES OF. THE EXISTING

01:46:46.566 --> 01:46:47.934
PARKS AND OPEN SPACES NOT

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.202
NECESSARILY BEING SUFFICIENT TO

01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.637
MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:52.639
CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES BOTH

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.508
THE- CONCERNS THAT WERE

01:46:54.574 --> 01:46:56.443
DISCUSSED EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:58.345
DISPROPORTIONATE ACCESS THAT

01:46:58.411 --> 01:46:59.212
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:46:59.279 --> 01:47:01.014
BASED ON GEOGRAPHY OR WEALTH OR

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:03.784
OTHER FACTORS- AS WELL AS-

01:47:03.850 --> 01:47:05.819
CONCERN OR AN INTEREST IN

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:08.121
EXPANDING. THE SHARE OF THE

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:10.590
STATE LAND IN COASTAL WATERS

01:47:10.657 --> 01:47:15.162
THAT ARE. CONCERNED FOR THE

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:15.762
FUTURE AND SO THAT. COURSE OF

01:47:15.829 --> 01:47:16.363
REFLECT IN THE GULF EXECUTIVE

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:20.066
ORDER. TO INCREASE THOSE LANDS

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:21.201
TO THIRTY PERCENT- BY TWENTY

01:47:21.268 --> 01:47:23.470
THIRTY. NOW WHETHER THE

01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:26.039
LEGISLATURE THINKING BOTH THE-

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:29.576
ABOUT THE- INVESTMENTS TO

01:47:29.643 --> 01:47:31.278
BETTER PROTECT EXISTING LAN OR

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:33.513
TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PUBLIC

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.448
SPACE THERE ARE OF COURSE

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:38.018
FISCAL CONSTRAINTS AND SO JUST

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.120
TO IDENTIFY AS WE TALKED ABOUT-

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.289
ON THE FIRST PAGE THE STATE

01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:43.990
FUNDING TYPICALLY COMES IN ONE

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:45.926
OF THREE. FLAVORS EITHER

01:47:45.992 --> 01:47:48.929
GENERAL FIND STATE BOND FUNDS

01:47:48.995 --> 01:47:50.797
OR SPECIAL FUNDS WHICH ARE

01:47:50.864 --> 01:47:52.799
TYPICALLY FUNDED THROUGH FEE

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.868
PAYERS ARE TAXPAYERS AND EACH

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:56.536
ONE OF THOSE CAN BE USED TO YOU

01:47:56.603 --> 01:47:58.205
CAN LOOK AT OPTIONS TO EXPAND

01:47:58.271 --> 01:48:00.273
IN THE USE OF ANY OF THOSE FOR

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.808
STATE AND LOCAL PARKS- BUT EACH

01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:03.210
COME WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF

01:48:03.276 --> 01:48:05.078
TRADE OFFS TO BE AWARE OF-

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:07.214
GENERAL FUND OF COURSE- IS

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.649
ALWAYS. SOMETHING THAT- ANY

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:12.352
PROGRAM HAS TO ADJUST TO FIND

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.087
HAVE TO COMPETE FOR ESSENTIALLY

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:15.956
IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS

01:48:16.022 --> 01:48:18.024
INCORPORATING NOW- MOST

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:19.759
RECENTLY BOTH OUR OFFICE IN THE

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:21.461
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:22.629
PROJECTED THAT THERE COULD BE

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:25.165
OUT YUR GENERAL FUND. DEFICIT

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:27.767
AND SO THAT CREATES A CHALLENGE

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.469
TO IDENTIFYING NEW FUNDING THAT

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:31.004
CAN BE USED TO EXPAND PROGRAMS

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:33.673
FROM THAT SOURCE- BOND FUNDS

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:36.209
LIKE PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT-

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:37.377
SOURCE THAT WE HAVE

01:48:37.444 --> 01:48:38.178
HISTORICALLY USED IN THE STATE

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:40.580
TO SUPPORT- PARKS AND IN OTHER

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:42.649
PROJECTS THE- PROBABLY THE MAIN

01:48:42.716 --> 01:48:43.850
THING TO JUST RECOGNIZE WITH

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:45.151
BOND FUNDS AS THOSE ARE ONE

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:46.953
TIME FUNDS. AND SO THAT'S VERY

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:49.589
APPROPRIATE FOR ACQUISITION OR

01:48:49.656 --> 01:48:53.059
DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES BUT

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:55.228
IS NOT REALLY THE BEST USE- OR

01:48:55.295 --> 01:49:01.534
OR THE BEST SOURCE. FOR ONGOING

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:02.736
OPERATIONAL COSTS. IN IN LASTLY

01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:03.336
COURSE YOU CAN ALL LOOK AT ALL

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.738
OF FOR. SPECIAL FOR REVENUES

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:07.274
EITHER FROM FEEDS TAX- THE MAIN

01:49:07.340 --> 01:49:09.209
TRADE OFF TO BE AWARE THERE IS

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:11.511
THOSE INCREASED REVENUES HAVE

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.013
TO BE ASSESSED ON SOMEONE

01:49:13.079 --> 01:49:14.180
WHETHER THAT THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:17.317
ARE VISITING THE PARKS OR-

01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:19.119
OTHER SOURCES AND SO YOU IN.

01:49:19.185 --> 01:49:20.287
CONCERNING THOSE TYPES OF

01:49:20.353 --> 01:49:21.721
OPTIONS YOU ALWAYS GOING TO BE

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:22.856
COGNIZANT OF WHO WOULD BE

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:24.224
PAYING THOSE FEES IS IT

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:28.395
EQUITABLE IN AUTUMN HOW THOSE

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:29.596
FUNDS ARE USED- SO WITH THAT I

01:49:29.663 --> 01:49:31.464
AM. HAPPY AT THE END OF THE

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.066

MEMBERS THAT WILL BE GOING IN

01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:39.239
AND OUT GOING TO TAKE LIBERTY

01:49:39.306 --> 01:49:40.774
THAT. ALLOWS SOME OF THE

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:43.376
MEMBERS TO MAYBE ASK YOU A

01:49:43.443 --> 01:49:43.944

QUESTIONS ONE OF THEM IS A

01:49:57.724 --> 01:50:00.026
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

DOLLARS IT'S ON PAGE- IN FIVE.

01:50:02.929 --> 01:50:03.663
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:05.732
IT WAS THE FACT FIELD BECAUSE

01:50:05.799 --> 01:50:07.400
THE PARKS WERE ANTICIPATED TO

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:11.104
HAVE LOWER REVENUE- AS A RESULT

01:50:11.171 --> 01:50:13.273
OF COVERT YET COVERT DROVE MORE

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:16.076
AND MORE PEOPLE- TO GO OUTSIDE-

01:50:16.142 --> 01:50:18.211
COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHERE THE

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:19.746
REVENUE LOSSES TOOK PLACE AND

01:50:19.813 --> 01:50:21.081
WHERE THE REVENUE GAINS TOOK

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:22.582
PLACE IF MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

01:50:22.649 --> 01:50:28.788
WERE. FREE INDUCING OR OR OR

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.123
FEE GENERATING- ASPECTS OF THE

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:33.960
PARKS. YES I THINK IT'S A

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:35.528
NUMBER IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND

01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:36.763
IT'S- SOMETHING THE PARKS

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.331
DEPARTMENT PEOPLE SPEAK TOO

01:50:38.398 --> 01:50:39.799
WELL BUT I THINK THERE'S A FEW

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:41.368
DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES HERE

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:43.370
THAT EXPLAINS THE INTEREST.

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:47.207
RATE PART OF IT IS I MEAN SO I

01:50:47.273 --> 01:50:50.777
THINK- SOME OF THE- LADIES THE

01:50:50.844 --> 01:50:53.880
N. M. PARKS WERE CLOSED AND

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:56.049
WE'RE WE'RE MORE CLOSED EARLIER

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:57.984
IN THAT THIS PAST SPRING AND IN

01:50:58.051 --> 01:51:00.153
THE SUMMER AND- THAT'S

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:01.287
OFTENTIMES SOME OF OUR HIGHEST

01:51:01.354 --> 01:51:03.456
REVENUE GENERATING PERIODS. AND

01:51:03.523 --> 01:51:04.024
SO THAT'S WHAT WE LOST SOME

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:05.625
REVENUE THERE PART OF IT TOO

01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:06.793
HAS TO DO WITH THE TYPES OF

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:08.862
FACILITIES THAT WERE CLOSED SO-

01:51:08.928 --> 01:51:10.130
FOR EXAMPLE I THINK MANY OF OUR

01:51:10.196 --> 01:51:11.498
MUSEUMS ARE STILL CLOSED AND

01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.867
THOSE ARE REVENUE. SOURCES FOR

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:17.203
US- THERE ARE ALSO- I THINK

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.905
OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE HAD

01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:20.006
GENERATED LESS REVENUE

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:22.809
DEPENDING ON- YOU KNOW RENTALS

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:24.077
AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:26.012
LIKE THAT AND THEN LASTLY I

01:51:26.079 --> 01:51:28.448
THINK IT IS ACCORDING TO THE

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:29.049
CONVERSATION TO HAVE WITH THE

01:51:29.115 --> 01:51:31.017
FARM IS WHERE VISITORS SHIFT

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:32.318
HAS HAPPENED THERE'S BEEN A

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:35.055
SHIFT IN SO. AND NOT ALL NOT

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.823
ALL PARTS CHANGED A CHARGE THE

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.726
SAME VISITOR ACCESS FEES AND SO

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:42.662
DEPENDING ON- WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:43.963
ACCESSING THEY MAY THEY MAY

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.331
STILL BE VISITING IN GREATER

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:45.832
NUMBERS BUT IF IT'S IN

01:51:45.899 --> 01:51:47.333
LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THAT

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.970
GENERATE LESS REVENUE FROM- THE

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:54.174
ACTUAL- FEASTED TO TOOK THE

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.775
PARKING FEES OR THE ENTRANCE

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:57.310
FEE. THAT COULD ACTUALLY

01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:58.978
DIMINISH THANK YOU MY OTHER

01:51:59.045 --> 01:52:00.847
QUESTION- FROM THERE THE

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.582
REFERENCE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:52:02.649 --> 01:52:03.650

ABLE TO ANSWER THIS-

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:06.186
ESTABLISHED A GOAL OF

01:52:06.252 --> 01:52:08.588
PROTECTING 30% OF THE STATE'S

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:11.758
LANDS BY TWENTY THIRTY- THAT'S

01:52:11.825 --> 01:52:14.427
30% OF THE STATE OWNED PROPERTY

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:16.262
IS THAT WHAT THAT REFERENCE OR

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:18.131

KNOW IF IT. BEEN EXACT DEFINE

01:52:26.339 --> 01:52:28.208
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:31.344
INTENTION IS 430% OF THE STATE

01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:33.947
AND 30% OF COASTAL WATERS. TO

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:36.149
BE- PROTECTED OR CONSERVANCY-

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:37.317

BASICALLY DEVELOP A PLAN. THAT

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:46.677
WOULD PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT FOR

02:29:46.744 --> 02:29:49.213

TELL YOU KNOW WHAT NEUTRAL HAS

02:30:09.233 --> 02:30:11.635
DONE. BUT TO DEMONSTRATE HOW

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.471
THESE THINGS CAN BE APPLE A

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:15.606
COUPLE ACROSS THE STATE. I'M A

02:30:15.673 --> 02:30:17.308

WORKING COLLECTIVELY. HOW TO

02:30:25.549 --> 02:30:26.450
MAKE IT HAPPEN AND NOT TO SAY

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.285

THE METRO TRANSIT DEPARTS

02:30:42.566 --> 02:30:43.934
STRATEGIC PLAN. IS THAT WE

02:30:44.001 --> 02:30:45.336
REALLY WANTED TO FOCUS ON TWO

02:30:45.403 --> 02:30:46.904
PROGRAMS ONE BEING COMMUNITY

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:49.039

SINGAPORE MOUNTAINS- ACCESS

02:30:50.775 --> 02:30:52.877
PROGRAM. IN A MINUTE TALK FIRST

ABOUT THE COMMUNITY TRANSIT

02:30:54.044 --> 02:30:55.045
PROGRAM BECAUSE I THINK THIS

02:30:55.112 --> 02:30:56.947
ONE IS SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:30:57.014 --> 02:30:59.150
AS WE'VE SEEN. A RECENTLY OUT

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:00.651
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND THIS

02:31:00.718 --> 02:31:02.553

DELHI COUNTY PARKS DID IS SO

02:31:04.188 --> 02:31:06.090

OUR WORK- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:09.160

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:10.995
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY- I HATE

02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:11.495
THAT TERM DISADVANTAGED

02:31:11.562 --> 02:31:12.730
COMMUNITIES WHILE INCOME

02:31:12.797 --> 02:31:15.099
COMMUNITIES- THAT HAVE NOT HAD.

02:31:15.166 --> 02:31:16.834
THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT- THAT

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:17.802
BROTHERS HAVE HAD OVER THE

02:31:17.868 --> 02:31:21.172
DECADES. ANDO WE FOCUSED OUR

02:31:21.238 --> 02:31:22.740

ADMISSION SEATS. SO THAT'S

02:31:41.859 --> 02:31:42.860
WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING OUR

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:44.361

THE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THAT-

02:31:53.871 --> 02:31:55.506
THAT GRAPHIC WELL THE SANTA

MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES BUT-

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:04.982
IN REALITY A WORLD AWAY BECAUSE

02:32:05.049 --> 02:32:05.916
OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF

ON HOGE'S. LOCATED WITHIN THESE

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:13.557
COMMUNITIES THAT COULD PAY TAKE

02:32:13.624 --> 02:32:14.992
PEOPLE DIRECTLY ON A REGULAR

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:17.695
BASIS AUG TWO PUBLIC LANDS IS

02:32:17.761 --> 02:32:19.163
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:21.265
WE THINK THIS PROGRAM. IS JUST-

02:32:21.332 --> 02:32:24.902
SO VIABLE- ALL WE KNOW IS THAT-

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:25.803
YOU KNOW THERE ARE

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.671
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE STATE IS

OFFERING AND THAT WE HAVE AT

02:32:28.839 --> 02:32:30.474
THE LOCAL LEVEL. I DO TRY TO

02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:32.209
PROMOTE THESE PROJECTS ARE

02:32:32.276 --> 02:32:34.411
IMPORTANT- THAT WE FOCUS ON

02:32:34.478 --> 02:32:35.846
THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH LIMITED

02:32:35.913 --> 02:32:38.148
OPTIONS. THAT WE DELIVER

02:32:38.215 --> 02:32:39.617
COMPREHENSIVE WRAP AROUND

SERVICES AND THAT FRANKLY WAS

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:42.553
STATE FUNDING IS I THINK THIS

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:44.355
COMMITTEE DOES VERY WELL HAS

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:46.156
BEEN CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF YOU

02:32:46.223 --> 02:32:47.658
KNOW STATE FUNDS SO FAR.

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:49.260
BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:50.227
FINDINGS OF DEPARTMENT OF

CALIFORNIA- SPECIFICALLY ON-

02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:41.965
DEAR DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE

02:40:42.032 --> 02:40:44.501
PLANTS. FOR ME IT NEEDS MORE

02:40:44.568 --> 02:40:46.236
FUNDING AND STAFF TO MANAGE IT

02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:47.571
STATE WILDLIFE AREAS

02:40:47.637 --> 02:40:48.772
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH

02:40:48.839 --> 02:40:51.008
INCLUDE MANAGE WETLANDS BECAUSE

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:52.342
THOSE MANAGED WETLANDS COSTS

02:40:52.409 --> 02:40:54.511
SIGNIFICANT SUMS OF MONEY TO

02:40:54.578 --> 02:40:56.413
MAINTAIN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:58.382
EXPENSES RELATED UP PUMPING

02:40:58.448 --> 02:41:01.852
WATER MISKITO ABATE MET FUEL

02:41:01.918 --> 02:41:04.121
NOXIOUS WEED CONTROL HAVE ALL

02:41:04.187 --> 02:41:06.990
RISEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LAST

02:41:07.057 --> 02:41:08.158
TWENTY YEARS BUT THE BUDGETS

02:41:08.225 --> 02:41:09.593
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT KEPT

02:41:09.659 --> 02:41:12.062
PACE WITH THAT- WILDLIFE

02:41:12.129 --> 02:41:13.830
HABITAT QUALITY NOT ONLY

02:41:13.897 --> 02:41:16.266
STOPPERS BUT IT CAN ALSO REDUCE

02:41:16.333 --> 02:41:17.334
TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT

02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:19.803
RECREATIONAL USE ONE FOR

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:22.005
EXAMPLE. WETLAND FLOODING HAS

02:41:22.072 --> 02:41:23.140
TO BE DELAYED BECAUSE THERE'S

02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:25.275
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PUMP

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:27.644
WATER. OUT WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S

02:41:27.711 --> 02:41:28.979
BUDGET DOES PROVIDE SOME

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:31.448
ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUR WORK

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:32.749
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE

02:41:32.816 --> 02:41:34.418
LANDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT I

02:41:34.484 --> 02:41:36.086
THINK A LOT MORE RESOURCES NEED

02:41:36.153 --> 02:41:37.821
TO BE TAKE DEDICATED THERE

02:41:37.888 --> 02:41:39.656
WE'VE GOT A LONG CALL TO GO TO

02:41:39.723 --> 02:41:41.391
REALLY GET THOSE. WILDLIFE

02:41:41.458 --> 02:41:44.161
AREAS OPERATING AT THEIR

02:41:44.227 --> 02:41:47.931
OPTIMAL CAPACITY. SOMETHING

02:41:47.998 --> 02:41:50.300
ELSE OUT WE THINK NEEDS TO BE

02:41:50.367 --> 02:41:53.637
LOOKED AT- WE HAVE A VERY

02:41:53.703 --> 02:41:55.539
ANTIQUATED LICENSE SYSTEM IN

02:41:55.605 --> 02:41:57.474
CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENSE

02:41:57.541 --> 02:42:00.477
SYSTEM AND FISHING LICENSE-

02:42:00.544 --> 02:42:02.045
THAT NEEDS TO BE FULLY

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:03.713
INTEGRATED INTO AN ELECTRONIC

02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:06.716
SYSTEM. WHILE OTHER STATES HAVE

02:42:06.783 --> 02:42:08.985
EMBRACED TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA

02:42:09.052 --> 02:42:11.455
FOR EXAMPLE STILL RELIES ON

02:42:11.521 --> 02:42:11.988
PAPER HUNTING AND FISHING

02:42:12.055 --> 02:42:14.991
LICENSES. THIS NOT NOT ONLY

02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:16.860
MAKES IT MORE BURDENSOME ON THE

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:19.062
HUNDRED CHOIR AND PROVED TO LAW

02:42:19.129 --> 02:42:20.363
ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIELD THAT

02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:22.399
HERE SHE HAS ALL THE REQUIRED

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:24.534
LICENSES AND VALIDATIONS BUT

02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:26.136
IT'S FRANKLY A DISINCENTIVE FOR

02:42:26.203 --> 02:42:28.038
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE BETTER

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:29.606
VERSED IN TECHNOLOGY TO

02:42:29.673 --> 02:42:31.575
PARTICIPATE IN THE HUNTING. SO

02:42:31.641 --> 02:42:32.876
ALLOWING LICENSES AND

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.578
VALIDATIONS TO BE DISPLAYED ON

02:42:34.644 --> 02:42:36.613
A MOBILE DEVICE WOULD PROVIDE

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.782
CONVENIENCE AND ALSO FULLY

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:41.118
BRING OUR LICENSING SYSTEM INTO

02:42:41.184 --> 02:42:43.420
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

02:42:43.487 --> 02:42:44.688
THERE'S A WONDERFUL PROGRAM

02:42:44.754 --> 02:42:46.223
THAT THAT HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS

02:42:46.289 --> 02:42:47.791
SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE CALLED

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:49.726
THE SHARE PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD

02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:51.461
REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT PROGRAM

02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:57.100
EXPANDED. SHARE PROGRAM- IS

02:42:57.167 --> 02:42:58.835
THERE A PROGRAM WHERE THE

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:00.670
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE

02:43:00.737 --> 02:43:03.173
PROVIDES FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.743
TO LANDOWNERS- TO BASICALLY

02:43:06.810 --> 02:43:08.445
ALLOW ACCESS FOR HUNTING AND

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:10.180
OTHER WILDLIFE DEPENDENT

02:43:10.247 --> 02:43:12.649
RECREATION. IN DOING SO THE

02:43:12.716 --> 02:43:14.117
PROGRAM ALSO ENCOURAGES

02:43:14.184 --> 02:43:15.852
LANDOWNERS TO MAINTAIN OUR LAND

02:43:15.919 --> 02:43:17.721
AS WILDLIFE HABITAT SO IT HAS

02:43:17.787 --> 02:43:20.090
THE DUAL BENEFIT. THE PROBLEM

02:43:20.157 --> 02:43:21.858
HAS BEEN THE FUNDING FOR THE

02:43:21.925 --> 02:43:24.094
PROGRAM IT'S BEEN VERY LIMITED-

02:43:24.161 --> 02:43:25.829
IT'S BEEN MOSTLY GENERATED BY

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:28.398
USER FEES- IMPOSED ON THE

02:43:28.465 --> 02:43:30.000
RECREATIONAL PARTICIPANTS IN

02:43:30.066 --> 02:43:31.768
THE PROGRAM. WHICH IS REALLY

02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:32.969
RESTRICTED THE NUMBER OF

02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:35.205
PROPERTIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT

02:43:35.272 --> 02:43:35.939
CAN AND ROLL UP AND DOWN THE

02:43:36.006 --> 02:43:38.775
STATE. SO WE WOULD SAY THAT

02:43:38.842 --> 02:43:40.343
FUTURE YOU KNOW PARKING OPEN

02:43:40.410 --> 02:43:43.013
SPACE BOND SHOULD. BE AMENDED

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:44.981
TO INCLUDE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY

02:43:45.048 --> 02:43:46.116
FOR THIS PROGRAM IT'S A IT'S A

02:43:46.183 --> 02:43:48.051
WONDERFUL PROGRAM WE KNOW

02:43:48.118 --> 02:43:49.886
THERE'S A LOT OF DEMAND FOR IT

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:52.322
AND WE JUST NEED FUNDING TO ARE

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.791
REALLY FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND

02:43:54.858 --> 02:43:58.195
TAKE IT STATEWIDE. WE ALSO

02:43:58.261 --> 02:44:00.864
WOULD RECOMMEND- THE STATE

02:44:00.931 --> 02:44:02.199
CREATED OR STRENGTHENED

02:44:02.265 --> 02:44:04.968
PARTNERSHIPS WITH NON- WITHOUT

02:44:05.035 --> 02:44:06.937
CONSERVATION ON PROFITS A

02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:08.371
GROWING NUMBER OF NONPROFIT

02:44:08.438 --> 02:44:09.940
CONSERVATION GROUPS IMPLEMENT

02:44:10.006 --> 02:44:11.775
PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO GET MORE

02:44:11.841 --> 02:44:13.777
PEOPLE INTO THE OUTDOORS OUR

02:44:13.843 --> 02:44:15.445
ORGANIZATION HAS DEVELOPED A

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:17.747
HUNT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES

02:44:17.814 --> 02:44:19.382
HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC ACCESS FOR

02:44:19.449 --> 02:44:21.751
WATERFOWL HUNTING TO SIXTY

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:23.286
THOUSAND ACRES OF PRIVATE LAND

02:44:23.353 --> 02:44:25.355
INCLUDING SEVERAL PROPERTIES-

02:44:25.422 --> 02:44:26.756
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE

02:44:26.823 --> 02:44:29.259
SYSTEM IN MARCH. THAT WE

02:44:29.326 --> 02:44:31.094
ACTUALLY OWNED IN FEE- THIS

02:44:31.161 --> 02:44:34.064
MOST NOTABLY INCLUDES- SPECIAL

02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:35.565
HONEY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTIVE

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:37.400
DUTY MIDDLE MILITARY PERSONNEL

02:44:37.467 --> 02:44:39.436
AND VETERANS. SO THAT'S A GREAT

02:44:39.502 --> 02:44:44.007
PART OF OUR PROGRAM IN OUR VIEW.

02:44:44.074 --> 02:44:45.575
ALTHOUGH IT WAS CURTAILED LAST

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:47.244
YEAR BECAUSE THE CODE WE ALSO

02:44:47.310 --> 02:44:49.045
OFFER YOUTH AND EDUCATION CAMPS

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:50.914
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.816
INTRODUCE NEWCOMERS TO HUNTING

02:44:52.882 --> 02:44:55.051
FISHING AND THE OUTDOORS- IN

02:44:55.118 --> 02:44:57.687
ADDITION WE ADMINISTER. THE

02:44:57.754 --> 02:44:59.322
BECOMING AN OUTDOORS WOMAN

02:44:59.389 --> 02:45:01.625
PROGRAM. WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:06.930
PROBABLY. FOCUSES ON PROVIDING

02:45:06.997 --> 02:45:08.298
WOMEN WHO TEND TO BE

02:45:08.365 --> 02:45:10.033
UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE HUNTING

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:11.935
AND FISHING COMMUNITY WITH AN

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:14.037
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN OUTDOOR

02:45:14.104 --> 02:45:17.874
SKILLS- IN A SAFE AND-

02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:20.644
ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENT- WE'RE

02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:23.980
ALSO WORKING BY THE WAY WITH-

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:25.215
ON FUTURE INITIATIVES WITH

02:45:25.282 --> 02:45:27.450
OUTDOOR AFRICA EXCUSE ME

02:45:27.517 --> 02:45:30.053
OUTDOOR AFRO. WHICH FOCUSES ON

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.888
CONNECTING AFRICAN AMERICANS

02:45:31.955 --> 02:45:34.224
WITHOUT DOOR EXPERIENCES SO

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:36.192
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

02:45:36.259 --> 02:45:38.161
THE PROGRAMS- THAT I JUST

02:45:38.228 --> 02:45:39.729
TALKED ABOUT RELY HEAVILY ON

02:45:39.796 --> 02:45:41.464
VOLUNTEERS AND DONATIONS TO

02:45:41.531 --> 02:45:42.966
KEEP COSTS TO THE PUBLIC AT A

02:45:43.033 --> 02:45:45.602
MINIMUM- THAT DEMAND FOR THESE

02:45:45.669 --> 02:45:47.404
PROGRAMS TYPICALLY EXCEEDS

02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:49.272
AVAILABLE SPACE. AND SOME

02:45:49.339 --> 02:45:51.007
PEOPLE MUST UNFORTUNATELY BE

02:45:51.074 --> 02:45:53.777
TURNED AWAY. THE MAJOR LIMITING

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:55.345
FACTOR THOUGH IS THE AMOUNT OF

02:45:55.412 --> 02:45:58.214
AVAILABLE LANDS AND VENUES. IF

02:45:58.281 --> 02:45:59.916
THE STATE COULD OFFER UP SOME

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:01.618
OF ITS OWN PROPERTIES WHERE NON

02:46:01.685 --> 02:46:03.486
PROFITS COULD IMPLEMENT THEIR

02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:05.722
OUTDOOR ACCESS PROGRAMS. THAT

02:46:05.789 --> 02:46:07.357
WOULD CERTAINLY ALLOW MORE

02:46:07.424 --> 02:46:10.460
PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE SO I

02:46:10.527 --> 02:46:11.027
THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:46:11.094 --> 02:46:13.797
THERE. I ALSO KNOW THAT- THERE

02:46:13.863 --> 02:46:15.365
ARE SOME STATE PROPERTIES WITH

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:16.633
THE STATES SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.335
THE STAFF RESOURCES TO

02:46:18.401 --> 02:46:20.470
ADMINISTER PUBLIC USE PROGRAMS.

02:46:20.537 --> 02:46:22.305
IN THESE CASES NONPROFIT

02:46:22.372 --> 02:46:24.374
CONSERVATION CONSERVATION

02:46:24.441 --> 02:46:26.443
GROUPS COULD HELP TO FILL THAT

02:46:26.509 --> 02:46:28.211
VOID MAKE THEM YOU KNOW USABLE

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:30.146
FOR THE PUBLIC. SO THEY'RE

02:46:30.213 --> 02:46:32.215
REAL- ARE THESE OPPORTUNITIES

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:33.550
OUT ON THE TABLE AND WE JUST

02:46:33.616 --> 02:46:36.252
NEED TO I THINK FULLY COME

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:38.621
TOGETHER AND- FIVE DAY OUT

02:46:38.688 --> 02:46:40.357
WORKING AGREEMENT AND IMPLEMENT

02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:41.925
THEM AND DOUBT THAT WOULD

02:46:41.991 --> 02:46:43.460
CERTAINLY HELP TO SOLVE SOME OF

02:53:26.329 --> 02:53:28.297
FISHING. I THINK- THERE

02:53:28.364 --> 02:53:30.199
PROBABLY IS ROOM TO DO A MORE

02:53:30.266 --> 02:53:32.301
SCIENTIFIC SURVEY THOUGH OF

WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA.

02:53:34.303 --> 02:53:35.738
SO I WOULD CERTAINLY YES

MORE OF A SCIENTIFIC- ANGLE ON

02:53:47.083 --> 02:53:48.684
ALL THIS SO THAT'S NOT

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:50.753
SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE WE

02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:52.321
SHOULD LOOK TO IN THE FUTURE.

02:53:52.388 --> 02:53:55.725
THANK YOU MARK. THE NEXT

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:58.261

THAT WILL HELP US MOVE THIS

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:20.883
PARTNERSHIP FORWARD ONE I THINK

02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:23.219

OF LIFE AND IT'S REALLY A

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.306
QUESTION OF PRIORITIES AND

03:00:50.372 --> 03:00:52.708
VALUES AND THE CHALLENGE. IS

03:00:52.775 --> 03:00:55.177
RELIABLE ON GOING FUNDING FOR

03:00:55.244 --> 03:00:56.378
THESE PROGRAMS IT'S NOT A

03:00:56.445 --> 03:00:57.980
QUESTION OF WHETHER THE

03:00:58.047 --> 03:01:00.082
STATEWIDE PARK PROGRAM IS. IT'S

03:01:00.149 --> 03:01:01.850

ACCEPTABLE TO COMMUNITIES YEAH

03:01:15.297 --> 03:01:18.467
WE ARE DEPENDENT ON BONDS FOR-

03:01:18.534 --> 03:01:19.735
TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS THAT IS

03:01:19.802 --> 03:01:22.738
NOT. A APPROACH AT THE LA- THAT

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:24.373
APPROPRIATE SOURCE TO SUPPORT

03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:26.141
ON GOING PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE

03:01:26.208 --> 03:01:29.044
UNRELIABLE- WE WANTED WE ALL

03:01:29.111 --> 03:01:30.246
THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE A BOND

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:31.413
LAST YEAR AND UP BECAUSE OF

03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:32.615
CIRCUMSTANCES OUT OF OUR

03:01:32.681 --> 03:01:34.717
CONTROL THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. WE

03:01:34.783 --> 03:01:36.852
HOPE TO HAVE A BOND IN TWENTY

03:01:36.919 --> 03:01:37.653
TWENTY TWO BUT WE DON'T KNOW

03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:39.388
THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN EITHER

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.357
AND EVEN IF IT DOES WE WON'T

03:01:41.423 --> 03:01:44.226
HAVE NEW MONEY UNTIL TWENTY

03:01:44.293 --> 03:01:45.494
TWENTY THREE AT THE EARLIEST.

03:01:45.561 --> 03:01:47.129
THE LAST FUNDING FOR THE STATE

03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:48.931
WIDE PART PROGRAM IS GOING OUT

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:57.106

DIRECTOR MITCHELL MAN CHIMP IS

03:01:58.607 --> 03:01:59.308
HAPPENING ON TWELFTH THAT THE

03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:01.410
LAB ABOUT MONEY YOU'RE BEING.

RESTORE FUNDING THAT PROGRAM SO

03:02:06.849 --> 03:02:09.051
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT DOESN'T SEEM

03:02:09.118 --> 03:02:11.220
TO BE A HOT IT STARKLY A HIGH

03:02:11.287 --> 03:02:13.322
PRIORITY BUT LOOKED AT AS AN

03:02:13.389 --> 03:02:15.224
AMENITY. SO THE CHALLENGE TO

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:17.526
THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEADERS

03:02:17.593 --> 03:02:21.363

FUNDING- PARK ACCESS. IS

03:02:34.243 --> 03:02:36.812
DEVASTATING AND- THE FIRST

03:02:36.879 --> 03:02:38.414
PLACE WE SHOULD START THIS TO

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:39.748
MAKE SURE PARTS ARE WITHIN

03:02:39.815 --> 03:02:42.017
WALKING DISTANCE OF PEOPLE AND

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.119
LOW INCOME DENSELY POPULATED

03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:45.888
URBAN AREAS. WE SHOULD BE

03:02:45.954 --> 03:02:48.057
PUTTING PARKS WHERE PEOPLE

03:02:48.123 --> 03:02:48.824
DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON

03:02:48.891 --> 03:02:52.161
TRANSPORTATION OR- SOME OTHER

03:02:52.227 --> 03:02:54.396
