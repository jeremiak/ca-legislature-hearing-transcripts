PARTICULAR DURING THIS TIME

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:59.810
PERIOD -- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
US TO PROVIDE A TWO WAYS WITH

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:03.247
SOME GUIDANCE AND HAVE A HOLD
REMOTE TELECONFERENCE MEETINGS

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:06.683

WALL I THINK WE ALL HOPE THAT

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:10.220
THE WORST OF CO THAT IS BEHIND
US ON THIS NEED CONTINUES

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:14.424
ALSO WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT
THIS BILL EXPLICITLY GIVES

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:17.828
MEMBERS OF HOAS EXACT SAME
PARTICIPATION ABILITIES AS

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:22.032
IF THEY WERE IN AN IN PERSON
MEETING AND WE'VE ALSO --

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:25.369
PLACE VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEN A PHYSICAL MEETING WOULD

00:48:25.435 --> 00:48:29.473
NOT BE POSSIBLE SO WELL WITH
THAT LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:32.542

THE OPPOSITION VERY QUICKLY
BY POINTING OUT THAT AS YOU

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:42.185
MENTIONED THIS IS A PERMISSIVE
BILL THAT IS VERY NARROW IN ITS

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:46.223
SCOPE AND AS FAR AS ELECTIONS
I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT THE

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:49.126
TESTIMONY FROM THE CALIFORNIA
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION LAW

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:51.862
PROVES OUR POINT WHICH IS THAT
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS ARE

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:55.465
ALREADY ENGAGING IN ELECTIONS
REMOTELY BECAUSE THERE'S NO

00:48:55.532 --> 00:48:59.303
GUIDANCE ARBIL SPECIFICALLY
STATES THAT YOU CAN ONLY HAVE

00:48:59.369 --> 00:49:02.539
A REMOTE ELECTION WHEN THERE
IS A DECLARED OR PROCLAIM

00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:06.143
DISASTER EMERGENCY THAT MAKES
IT UNSAFE OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR

00:49:06.209 --> 00:49:09.546
PEOPLE TO GATHER IN PERSON IT
EXPLICITLY REQUIRES THAT THOSE

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.215
MEETING THOSE BALLOTS HAVE TO
BE COUNTED AND TABULATED BY

00:49:12.282 --> 00:49:15.652
VIDEO CONFERENCE IN FRONT OF
A CAMERA IN A LOCATION SUCH

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:18.221
THAT MEMBERS CAN WITNESS THE
INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS COUNTING

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:21.391
AND TABULATING THE VOTES ARE
THOSE PROCEDURES DO NOT EXIST

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:24.695

COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH STATE AND

IS MISSING FROM THIS BILL FROM
SB THREE NINETY TWO IS A VERY

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:35.805
BASIC REQUIREMENTS THAT THE
ASSOCIATION OF CHAMBER CONSENT

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:41.978
OF THE HOMEOWNER THIS IS A
CORD ASIAN OF STATE AND FEDERAL

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:48.284
PRIVACY LAWS A PRIVATE EMAIL
ADDRESS CANNOT BE USED UNLESS

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:53.322
AND UNTIL THE CONSENT OF THE
OWNER OF THAT EMAIL ADDRESS

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:57.827
HAS BEEN OBTAINED THAT IS SO
IMPORTANT MISSING INGREDIENT

01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:03.399
FROM THIS BILL HIT BASICALLY
IS TRYING TO EXEMPT HOMEOWNER

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:08.671

THAT ASSESSMENT CERTAINLY I

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:57.820
CAN'T PREDICT THAT UNDER THIS
STATUTE ASSOCIATIONS ARE GOING

01:05:57.887 --> 01:06:02.325
TO START TO DELIVER LEGAL
NOTICES BY EMAIL BECAUSE THERE

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:06.762

DOING THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:10.666

IT BY MAIL THEY CAN DO THAT
WITHOUT PROVIDING THE OTHER

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:01.463

WHATEVER COMMUNICATIONS I'VE

PROVIDE AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:22.544
PAPER NOTICES SO I THINK THIS
REALLY DOES SORT OF BALANCE --

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:26.782
I THINK THE INTEREST WILL HAVE
TO NOT INSURE THAT TO MINIMIZE

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:30.119
PAPER WASTE BUT ALSO ENSURING
THAT FOLKS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.354
TO CHOOSE THE DELIVERY METHOD
THAT IS SUITED TO THEIR

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:35.424
NEEDS SO WITH THAT MR KILEY

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:39.628
SO I GOT ABOUT POINT BUT ON THE
OTHER HAND THIS BILL DOESN'T

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:40.796
JUST AUTHORIZED THE H.

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:45.100
AWAY TO SEND THESE -- NOTICES
ELECTRONICALLY BUT ACTUALLY --

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:48.370
REQUIRES THEM TO RIDE SO THAT
KINDA SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:50.939
THAT'S PRETTY SPECIFIC FOR
US TO BE DECIDING ON BEHALF

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:54.343
OF EVERY CHOICE WHY NOT JUST
MAKE IT AUTHORIZED AS OPPOSED

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.079
TO WELL MANDATORY WHEN YOU
THINK ABOUT YOUR HOMEOWNERS

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.882
ASSOCIATION I SHARE THIS WITH
SO MANY I'VE BEEN BROUGHT

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:03.686
REAL ESTATE BROKER FOR OVER
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND WHEN

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:07.523
YOU PURCHASE A HOMEOWNERS --
WELL YOU PURCHASED A TOWNHOUSE

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:10.659
CONDOMINIUM WHATEVER THE
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:14.029
THE STRUCTURE IS SO VITAL IN
THAT PURCHASE PEOPLE DON'T

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:17.266
REALIZE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH REVENUES IF YOU

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:22.738
DON'T HAVE IN US -- -- BACKING
FROM THE PRESIDENT AND SOME

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:27.209
OF THE BOARD MAINTENANCE IS
SO IMPORTANT THE BUDGET IS SO

01:12:27.276 --> 01:12:31.380
IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO ANALYZE
THESE DOCUMENTS IS SO IMPORTANT

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:35.417
AND IF THERE'S A CHANGE BECAUSE
REVITALIZING THE SWIMMING POOL

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:39.788
PLACING ROUGH SHOT AN INCREASE
IN FEES IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:43.792
THEY COMMUNICATE THIS IS THE
JUST TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:48.263
IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY WE CAN
AND WE HEARD EARLIER THAT NOW

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.501
IN THE WORLD OF ZOOMING THAT
THAT'S ALSO NOW ON THE TABLE

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:55.404
BUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THE
DOORS OPEN AS I KEEP SAYING

01:12:55.471 --> 01:13:00.008
AND IT'S VITAL WHEN WE'RE
LOOKING AT CITY AND COUNTY

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:04.046
FUNCTIONS OR CITY OR COUNTY
REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:07.983
THE ASSOCIATION SO EVERYONE'S
GOT A NO AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:11.253
THIS IS THAT EVERY ANNUAL SO
IT'S AN ANNUAL THING THEY'LL

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.857
CHECK AND RECHECK IF YOU WANT
TO GET IT BY EMAIL YOU WANT TO

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:17.960
GET IT BY MAIL IF YOU'VE BEEN
A CHANGE AND THAT'S IT AND

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:21.530
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO OPT OUT

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:25.667
