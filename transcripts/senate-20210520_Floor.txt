THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SB SEVEN TWELVE SIX TO RECTIFY YEARS OF LONGSTANDING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT HAVE DEPRIVED NATIVE AMERICANS FROM A FAIR PROCESS IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO ACQUIRE A STRICTER THAN FEDERAL LANDS AS MANY OF US KNOW THE HISTORY OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE STATE- HAS WITHIN IT MANY MANY SHAMEFUL EVENTS. THAT NOT ONLY REQUIRE. US TO REFLECT ON OUR PAST PRACTICES BUT TO TAKE STEPS NOW TO REVERSE ALL THOSE YEARS OF DISCRIMINATION NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED FROM DECADES OF VIOLENCE MISTREATMENT EXPLOITATION ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THERE ARE DISPOSSESSED DISPOSSESSION OF THEIR ANCESTRAL LANDS EXTERMINATION GENOCIDE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST DESPITE DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO NATIVE AMERICANS. CAME FROM THE GENERAL ALLOTMENT ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH BROKE A PRESERVATION LANDS RESULTING IN A LOSS OF NINETY MILLION ACRES NATIONWIDE. AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TOOK TWO THIRDS OF TRIBAL LAND WITHOUT DUE COMPENSATION. MANY OF US KNOW THAT AND HAVE VISITED RESERVATIONS IN OUR STATE AND I'VE SEEN. THAT OFTENTIMES THE LEAST VALUABLE LAND UNDEVELOPED MOBILE PLAN LAND THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO AGRICULTURAL OR COMMERCIAL. VALUE ARE THE LANDS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE NATIVE AMERICANS WITH THE HOPES THAT THEY WOULD NOT PROSPER. SO THIS. IS AN IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL. I WOULD ALLOW SOME JUSTICE TO BE GIVEN IN THEN SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE AS A FAIR HEARING WHEN NATIVE AMERICANS LOOK TO. ADD OF SOME LAND AROUND THERE THERE. THEIR RESERVATIONS TO THE TRUST. IN SOME CASES COUNTIES HAVE HAD LONG STANDING POLICIES THEY HAVE ACTUALLY HAD LAWS STATING THAT ANY TIME A TRIBE APPLIES THEY WILL BE OPPOSED AUTOMATICALLY THIS BILL CORRECTS THAT THIS UP. THESE BLANKET OPPOSITION POLICIES ARE STILL A REFLECTION OF HISTORICAL STRUCTURAL RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS TO WHICH CALIFORNIA SHOULD NO LONGER HAVE ANY PART OF. THIS BILL REQUIRES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHO OPPOSES AN APPLICATION TO INCLUDE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE TRIBE ON ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT THE TRIED MADE TO THE COUNTY THIS BILL. OF ALLOWS TRIBES CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE- BUT ADDED TO THE FILE. AS THEY ARE OF. THE PIPELINE TO ADD LAND TO THE TRUST. TRIBES ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE JOBS THAT SUPPORT LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS THEY MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCE HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS AMONG OTHER THINGS THEY ALSO BRING IMPORTANT FEDERAL DOLLARS INTO OUR STATE. WE MUST TAKE THESE BENEFITS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN MAKING A DECISION ON WHETHER TO SUPPORT OR SUPPORT OPPOSE APPEAR TO TRUST. ACQUISITION SEVEN TWELVE THIRTY IS A BILL THAT WILL FURTHER OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO RECTIFY PAST MISTAKES AND PROVIDE NATIVE AMERICANS THE FURNACE THEY DESERVE AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.
