CALIFORNIA IS DOOMED.

GROWTH.

01:05:19.115 --> 01:05:22.018 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:24.888 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE IN THE WORK THAT

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:26.756 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DOING HAS RISEN SO HIGH.

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:28.625 region:rollup2
THAT CONTRAST SHARPLY WITH THE

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.627 region:rollup2
ABYSMAL APPROVAL RATINGS GIVEN

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.195 region:rollup2

PASS THE BUDGET.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:48.578 region:rollup2
BUT PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IS ALSO

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.512 region:rollup2
BUT INSPIRED BY YOUR PASSING

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:51.181 region:rollup2
WITH BOTH REPUBLICANS IN

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.982 region:rollup2

PENSION REFORM.

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:57.921 region:rollup2
I DON'T MINIMIZE THAT THAT WAS A

01:05:55.018 --> 01:05:59.489 region:rollup2
BIG PENSION REFORM MAY NOT BE

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:00.390 region:rollup2
THE FINAL ONE BUT IT WAS THERE

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:06.396 region:rollup2

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:15.371 region:rollup2
BOND. THE RAINY DAY FUND AND THE

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:17.240 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:18.808 region:rollup2

AND THERE PASSAGE DEMONSTRATES

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:42.131 region:rollup2
THAT SOME AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:43.766 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAN GET STUFF DONE.

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:46.269 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEEPENING

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:48.037 region:rollup2
PARTISAN DIVISION.

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:49.772 region:rollup2
THE RECENT FIRES A MUD SLIDE

EVEN WHEN THEIR OWN OWN HOMES

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:39.188 region:rollup2
WERE BURNING.

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.490 region:rollup2

IN THIS REGARD. WE SHOULD NEVER

FORTY MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THE

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:43.186 region:rollup2

01:08:47.757 --> 01:08:50.126 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO INNOVATE

CONSTANTLY AND CREATE ALL MANNER

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.196 region:rollup2

THE DEVASTATING FOREST FIRES IN

THE MUD SLIDES ARE PROFOUND AND

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:05.308 region:rollup2
GROWING CHALLENGE.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:07.944 region:rollup2
EIGHT OF THE STATE'S MOST

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:09.979 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:11.347 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.750 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR'S THOMAS FIRE IN THE

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:15.952 region:rollup2

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:18.755 region:rollup2
IN RECORDED HISTORY.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.957 region:rollup2
THE MUD SLIDES THAT FOLLOWED

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:22.525 region:rollup2
WERE AMONG THE MOST LETHAL THIS

01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:24.460 region:rollup2
STATE HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED.

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:25.695 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THE

OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:34.237 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S FIRE SEASON HAS

01:09:32.035 --> 01:09:35.838 region:rollup2
INCREASED SEVENTY EIGHT DAYS IN

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:37.974 region:rollup2
SOME PLACES.

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:39.676 region:rollup2
NEARLY YEAR ROUND.

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:40.643 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE TO BE READY WITH THE

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.645 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FIRE FIGHTING

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:44.747 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY AND THE COMMUNICATION

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:47.383 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS TO WARN RESIDENTS OF

IT'S VITAL FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:21.517 region:rollup2
AND FOR THE WHOLE STATE THAT'S

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:23.152 region:rollup2
TRUE THAT'S WHY. AND THAT'S THE

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.854 region:rollup2
REASON WHY I PERSIST.

EASY.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:40.002 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS ESSENTIAL GIVEN THE

ACTUALLY BUILDING.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:22.831 region:rollup2
TAKES A LONG TIME.

01:18:21.497 --> 01:18:24.733 region:rollup2
WELL AGAIN THE BIG PROJECT THEIR

01:18:22.831 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
OBSTACLES THERE WERE FOR THE BAY

01:18:24.733 --> 01:18:28.204 region:rollup2
AREA RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM FOR

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:30.306 region:rollup2
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IN THE

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.540 region:rollup2
PANAMA CANAL.

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:33.108 region:rollup2
A PASSOVER IN SILENCE THE TIME

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.443 region:rollup2
IT TOOK TO BUILD THE THE BAY

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:35.544 region:rollup2
AREA BRIDGE THAT WAS ALMOST

01:18:34.443 --> 01:18:36.579 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.680 region:rollup2
AND BY THE WAY WAS OVER BUDGET

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:39.481 region:rollup2
BY.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.217 region:rollup2

WELL ONE BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:47.556 region:rollup2
SO THAT HAPPENS.

01:18:46.422 --> 01:18:50.759 region:rollup2
BUT KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WE

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:51.827 region:rollup2
GOT THAT WOULD COVER.

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:53.562 region:rollup2
BUT BUILDING TODAY DID PULL

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:56.432 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTS A BILL THAT WE

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:58.167 region:rollup2
WILL AMERICA'S FIRST HIGH SPEED

EXPANDING AIRPORTS WHICH NOBODY

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.937 region:rollup2

NOTHING IS MORE IN FUNDAMENTAL.

01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:17.406 region:rollup2

PART OF PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN

HEALTHY AND SAFE COMMUNITIES BUT

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:33.088 region:rollup2
THERE STILL IS CRIME. LOTS OF IT

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:34.690 region:rollup2
IN MANY CASES QUITE SERIOUS.

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:36.958 region:rollup2
TO COMBAT CRIME AMONG OTHER

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:38.627 region:rollup2
THINGS CALIFORNIA'S CREATED AN

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.561 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE PRISON SYSTEM

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:40.896 region:rollup2
THAT IS CHANGE QUITE

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:42.364 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY AND GROWN OVER THE

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:44.766 region:rollup2
DECADES.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:46.702 region:rollup2
IN FACT HE GREW SO FAST IT

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:49.237 region:rollup2
BECAME SO CROWDED THAT UNITED

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:51.373 region:rollup2

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:53.442 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED ORDER REQUIRING

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:54.643 region:rollup2
DRASTIC CHANGES.

01:26:53.442 --> 01:26:56.445 region:rollup2
DID GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:58.113 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE THE PROBLEM.

01:26:56.445 --> 01:27:00.048 region:rollup2
HERE'S SOME OF THE FACTS

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:01.983 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.118 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PRISON ONE HUNDRED

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:04.586 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVEPERSONS PRODUCE

01:27:03.118 --> 01:27:06.455 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:08.657 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER NOW STANDS AT THREE

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:10.459 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE.

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:12.461 region:rollup2
THE CORRECTIONS BUDGET THEN WAS

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:14.262 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE PERCENT. OF THE

01:27:12.461 --> 01:27:15.730 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND NOTES  <u><c.green>POINT</c></u>

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:17.532 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT ABOUT TWELVE

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:19.935 region:rollup2
BILLION.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:22.003 region:rollup2
YET LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:23.472 region:rollup2
REPORTED FELONIES WAS ACTUALLY

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:25.607 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN IT WAS IN NINETEEN

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:27.409 region:rollup2
SEVENTY.

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:28.009 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.878 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE HEADED

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:31.079 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:32.748 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:33.281 region:rollup2
THOUSAND WORDS.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:36.084 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY GOT TO PEOPLE

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:38.487 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:40.355 region:rollup2
TODAY THAT NUMBER HAS GROWN TO

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:42.157 region:rollup2
ONE POINT TWO MILLION.

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:43.425 region:rollup2
BY COMPARISON. THE TEN

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:53.301 region:rollup2
COMMANDMENTS RUN JUST UNDER

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:53.969 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED WORDS.

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:57.372 region:rollup2
ONLY TEN COMMANDMENTS IS STILL

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2
TEN.

01:27:57.372 --> 01:28:00.509 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THERE MORE THAN

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.244 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND SEPARATE CRIMINAL

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:04.179 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:05.981 region:rollup2
SO US ONE WHAT IS CRIMINAL WHAT

01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:07.716 region:rollup2
THE PENALTY SHOULD BE. WHAT

01:28:05.981 --> 01:28:10.385 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENT SHOULD BE ADDED AND

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:13.255 region:rollup2
WHAT CREDITS MIGHT BE BR?

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:15.190 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THIS HAS CHANGED.

01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:17.659 region:rollup2
I'D SAY CHANGE OVER OVER AGAIN

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:19.261 region:rollup2
AND TURNED OVER THE DECADES AS

01:28:17.659 --> 01:28:21.062 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IS INACTIVE

01:28:19.261 --> 01:28:22.931 region:rollup2
ENLIST NEW CRIME LAWS AND THE

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:25.133 region:rollup2
VOTERS HAVE APPROVED ONE BALLOT

01:28:22.931 --> 01:28:26.735 region:rollup2
MEASURE AFTER ANOTHER. USUALLY

01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:28.670 region:rollup2
BUT NOT ALWAYS ADDING MORE TIME

01:28:26.735 --> 01:28:30.472 region:rollup2
IN PRISON.

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:32.874 region:rollup2
MY PLEA IS RELATIVELY

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:34.810 region:rollup2
STRAIGHTFORWARD TAKE TIME TO

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:36.611 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM A CRIME

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:38.680 region:rollup2
AND PUNISHMENT HAS INVOLVED HOW

01:28:36.611 --> 01:28:40.615 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.550 region:rollup2
DEVISED THEIR PRISON SYSTEM.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.951 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CHANGES MIGHT WE KNOW

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.686 region:rollup2
ME.

01:28:42.951 --> 01:28:47.088 region:rollup2
I URGE INSTEAD OF ENACTING NEW

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:49.090 region:rollup2
LAWS BECAUSE A HORRIBLE CRIMES

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:50.825 region:rollup2
AND LURID HEADLINES YOU CONSIDER

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:52.294 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL SYSTEM.

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:55.030 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT MIGHT NEED A WHAT

01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:56.565 region:rollup2
TRULY PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:57.499 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE MENTAL

01:28:56.565 --> 01:28:59.501 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND DRUG TREATMENT

01:28:57.499 --> 01:29:07.642 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:09.110 region:rollup2
AND BETTER TRAINED. IMAGES.

01:29:07.642 --> 01:29:10.846 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE GETTING.

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:13.782 region:rollup2
WHAT MORE IS NEEDED?

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:15.450 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HOPE.

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:17.252 region:rollup2
OPENS YOU KNOW IS ONE OF THE

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:19.454 region:rollup2
THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES ALONG WITH

01:29:17.252 --> 01:29:21.723 region:rollup2
FAITH AND CHARITY.

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:23.925 region:rollup2
ONE HUMAN BEING GETS A TWENTY OR

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:25.927 region:rollup2
FORTY YEAR SENTENCE AS TENS OF

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:27.395 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS DO INCENTIVES TO

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:28.997 region:rollup2
REFORM WEAKENED. AND

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:30.865 region:rollup2
HOPELESSNESS AND VIOLENCE

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:33.468 region:rollup2
TAKEOVER MAKING PRISON GANG

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:35.537 region:rollup2
INFLUENCE ALL THE MORE POWERFUL.

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:37.539 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY RECENT MEASURES ARE

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:39.007 region:rollup2
SO VITAL WHICH ALLOW THE

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:41.009 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY IN ONLY THE

01:29:39.007 --> 01:29:43.812 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF EARLIER PAROLE

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
AND MILESTONE CREDITS FOR THOSE

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:54.556 region:rollup2
WHO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND.

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:56.091 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANT OR THE

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:57.959 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO WALKED

01:29:56.091 --> 01:30:00.762 region:rollup2
THE HALLS IT PUT THEIR LIVES ON

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:02.030 region:rollup2
THE LINE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH

ALL MANNER OF IN ME.

01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:06.701 region:rollup2
THEIR JOB IS TO KEEP THE PLACE

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:08.303 region:rollup2
SAFE. NEVER AN EASY TASK.

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:11.239 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF

01:30:08.303 --> 01:30:12.774 region:rollup2
RESPECT IN ORDER IN FOSTER A

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:14.509 region:rollup2
SPIRITED REHABILITATION WHENEVER

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:16.177 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE.

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:17.579 region:rollup2
THERE THOUSAND OTHERS WHO WORK

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:19.180 region:rollup2
IN THE PRISONS WHO ALSO DESERVE

01:30:17.579 --> 01:30:21.049 region:rollup2
OUR SUPPORT.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.717 region:rollup2
IT'S ALL OUT OF SIGHT.

01:30:21.049 --> 01:30:23.918 region:rollup2
BUT PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:25.520 region:rollup2
INMATES WILL BE RETURNING TO

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.455 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:29.257 region:rollup2
MOST A MORAL. AND WE WANT THEM

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:38.199 region:rollup2
TO BE AS REFORM AND

REHABILITATED AS POSSIBLE.

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:41.736 region:rollup2
FOR THE REST.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:44.339 region:rollup2
TWO IS MUCH WE CAN DO TOGETHER

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:45.473 region:rollup2
BEFORE THIS YEAR ENDS.

01:30:44.339 --> 01:30:47.943 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE TRULY EXCITING

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:50.612 region:rollup2
TIMES FULL OF POSSIBILITIES.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:52.280 region:rollup2
