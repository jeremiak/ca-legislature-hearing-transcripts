00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.272
THEY'VE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I

00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:37.007
HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.442
THINK THAT NO ONE IS LISTENING

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:39.009
TO THEM IN THEIR FEARS THAT

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:40.277
THEY'RE LOSING THE COUNTRY.

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:42.546
THAT THEY LOVE. LET ME BE

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:45.115
CLEAR. THOSE WHO ARE COMMITTED

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.416
WHO COMMITTED THIS INSURRECTION

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.751
MUST BE PUNISHED TO THE FULLEST

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.354
EXTENT OF THE LAW. BUT WE MUST

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.688
SHOW UNDERSTANDING FOR THOSE

00:49:51.755 --> 00:49:52.989
RADICALIZED BY SOCIAL MEDIA

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.157
POSTS BY NARCISSISTIC

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:55.892
POLITICIANS AND SHOCK JOCK

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.061
GRIFTERS HAVE GOTTEN RICH OFF

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:58.695
OF EXPLOITING PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:01.398
AND FEARS. WE MUST SHOW THEM

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.432
LOVE AND ASK THEM TO COME HOME

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.867
TO AMERICA BUT HERE'S THEIR

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:08.872
VOICES. YES I'M SAYING THAT WE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:12.109
NEED RECONCILIATION AND HEALING.

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.010
BUT THAT COMES AFTER

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:18.315
ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPENTANCE.

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:20.016
WE CAN BEGIN THAT PROCESS TODAY

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.351
BY STANDING UNITED IN THE

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.953
DEFENSE OF FREEDOM AND

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:24.654
DEMOCRACY AND ANNOUNCING THE

00:50:24.721 --> 00:50:27.791
BIG LIE. AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.526
AND I BELIEVE THAT. OUR LOVE OF

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:30.894
LIBERTY IS WHAT SETS US APART

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.496
FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:34.731
LIBERTY CANNOT INDOOR WITHOUT

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:37.000
RESPONSIBILITY. MANY OF US

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:38.068
WOULD PREFERRED THAT THE

00:50:38.135 --> 00:50:39.603
PRESIDENT WOULD TAKE PERSONAL

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:40.170
RESPONSIBILITY AND RESIGN ON

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.172
HIS OWN VOLITION. SINCE HE

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:44.307
FAILED TO DO SO THE PEOPLE AND

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.542
THE REPRESENTATIVES MUST HOLD

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.611
HIM RESPONSIBLE WITH THE TOOLS

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:50.113
OF THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:50.881
THE PRESIDENT INVITED THE

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:53.450
INSURRECTIONIST HE INCITED THEM

00:50:53.517 --> 00:50:55.185
AND FOR TOO LONG HE DID NOTHING

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:58.255
TO STOP THEM. MEMBERS IF THAT

00:50:58.321 --> 00:51:00.290
IS NOT AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:03.593
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.128

OUR NATIONAL CAPITAL COMPLETELY

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:27.957
APPALLING. I TWEETED ABOUT IT

OF THE THINGS THE AUTHOR IS SET.

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:42.772
WHAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH. IS

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:44.174
THE FACT THAT THE TWENTY FIFTH

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.609
AMENDMENT TIMELINE SIMPLY IS

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:49.846
NOT THERE. REGARDLESS OF HOW

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:53.883
MANY OF ALL OF US WISH IT WAS.

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:56.453
WE HAVE A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT.

00:55:56.519 --> 00:56:00.023
WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING OF COVERT.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.826
WE HAE AREAS IN OUR STATE.

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:03.993
WHERE FAMILY STILL CAN'T PUT

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.796
FOOD ON THEIR TABLE. WE HAVE

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:08.031
PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT I STILL

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:11.568
LIVE IN THIRD WORLD CONDITIONS

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:15.405
AND DON'T HAVE RUNNING WATER.

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.273
BUT INSTEAD THE FIRST THING WE

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:22.112
DO ON THE FLOOR IN CALIFORNIA.

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:23.947
IS THERE A POLITICAL PUNCH AT A

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:26.716
LAME DUCK. I THINK THAT'S TO

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:28.384
BLAME I THINK THE FIRST THING

00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.552
WE SHOULD BE DOING IS HELPING

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:33.089
FAMILIES. WITH COLBY. LOOKING

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:34.691

FRONT LINE WORKERS THAT NEED

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:46.169
THE VACCINE BUT NO WE'RE GOING

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.471

THAT WE AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS DID

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:24.507
NOT TO SHOULD DEVELOP WHEN A

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:26.209
RATIONAL MIND SAYS. IT'S NOT

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.111
THE RIGHT THING TO DO THAT WE

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.513
ACTUALLY MOTIVATED BY THE WORDS

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:06.315
OF OUR LAST SPEAKER HERE TO

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.550
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS RESOLUTION

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.018
AS A REFLECTIVE OF WHO A

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:11.154
REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE. THIS

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.089
ISN'T REALLY OUR FIRST ACTION

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:13.956
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:16.092
BUSINESS- THAT WE HAVE BEFORE

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.661
US AND WASHINGTON DC IN THE

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.096
POLITICS AND THE POLICIES THAT

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.398
HAVE COME OUT OF THERE THIS IS

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.800
A CONTINUATION OF OUR POSITION-

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.636
TO REALLY MAKE IT A POINT TO

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:29.238
SAY THAT WE DO NOT STAND FOR-

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.240
THE POLITICS AND THE POLICIES.

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.976
THAT HAVE BEEN HURTING PEOPLE

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.279
IN THIS COUNTRY- THROUGHOUT THE

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.114
LAST FOUR YEARS AND I THINK

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.283
THIS PANDEMIC CLEARLY IS A

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.985
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT ECONOMY

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.287
THAT WILL HAVE TO FOCUS ON

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.856
PURELY IS A REFLECTION OF THAT

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:49.258
AND SO I ALSO HOPE THAT THE

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.327
TAKEAWAY HERE ISN'T THAT- YOU

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:52.795
KNOW BUT WE ARE MAKING A

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.997
COMPARISON BETWEEN POOR WHITE

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.599
PEOPLE AND POOR. PEOPLE OF

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.301
COLOR BECAUSE THAT'S NOT I

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.369
BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:02.338
SHOULD ENTERTAIN OUR DEBATE

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.740
BECAUSE WE CARE AND THERE IS A

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:06.776
BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:08.277
