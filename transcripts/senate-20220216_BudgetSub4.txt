AFTERNOON THIS MARVELOUS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS WEEK OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT PROVIDING OUR OVERALL COMMENTS ON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING PACKAGE ON THOSE ARE REFLECTED IN SUMMARY IN THE AGENDA BEFORE YOU TODAY- BUT JUST A FEW ADDITIONAL- HIGHLIGHTS. IS WANTED TO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF TO CONTINUE OVERSIGHT ON THE MAJOR INVESTMENTS AND PROVIDING IN RECENT YEARS I'M JUST REALLY THAT THE FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION EARLIER TDAY. ADDITIONALLY NOTING SORT OF A SECONDARY BENEFIT IDENTIFIED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS USING HOUSING AND SELECTING TO WHERE HOUSING IS LOCATED AT THAT WAY TO SORT OF ADDRESS STATES CLINICAL CERTAINLY SORT OF MERITORIOUS IN A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT IN A MORE WORK WILL BE NEEDED OVER THE LONG TERM TO ENSURE SORT OF THERE'S NO FULL ALIGNMENT INTO THINK ABOUT CLIMATE LEARN MORE ONGOING BASIS TO MAKE HOUSING- POLICY DECISION. FOR MARCH THE PROCESSING HOW THE PACKAGE AND TO SEE FORWARD AND IT'S GOALS WILL BE OF. IN PARTICULAR THINKING ABOUT HOW THE BUDGET PACKAGE A LINE THE B. C. A POLICY. TAKEN FOR THE LARGEST STUFF EXAMPLE NO RECENTLY TO STREAMLINE PROCESS. TO ALLOW- TO A CERTAIN BILL TO PUTS ARE SPLIT DOWN LAW INTO THE UPPER TO BRING A- BETWEEN BUDGET AND POLICY INTENT PERHAPS ANOTHER- ACTIONS CAN BE FORWARD. ADDITIONAL INTO AREAS OF THE BUDGET THE STATE OF LIMIT WILL BE ON IS AN WILL BE COULD TO BE AS OF A MAJOR CONCERN. IN THIS NOT BECAUSE OUTLAY PER ARE EX FROM THE FALLA OF THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE IF THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU CAN BE EXCLUDED THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T ALLOCATE MORE FUNDING TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM CAN MAKE OTHERWISE BE- BE AVAILABLE DUE TO SERVICE OUR CONSTRAINTS. I MEAN ULTIMATELY SORT OF ANY PACKAGE OF THE LEGISLATURE- DOES AUTHORIZING A WEEK COULD YOU TO THINK THAT- HAVING STRONG SOARED TRACTOR. AND ENSURE THEIR A KIND OF THE ME FORWARD WILL BE VERY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR YOUR COM- REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE- WE'RE GOING TO BE THE ISSUE BACK TO THE- COMMITTEE AND SEE IF THERE. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. US SAYING NINE I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. I IN THE- TO THE AFFORD HOUSING THE STATE OF. COMMUNITY GRANDPA. IS THAT SET ASIDE FOR A- STILL TEND NEED TO COME FROM MR OLMSTEAD. WHILE WE ADMINISTER ON BEHALF OF THE SPEAKER COUNCILS THE RIGHT. SET OF POLICIES BUT- SO BILLS COULD ALWAYS CERTAINLY BE ADDRESSED AT THIS RECALL COUNCIL BUT THIS AUGMENTATION IS ESSENTIALLY ADDITIONAL FUSION UNDER THE CURRENT RULES. ALL RIGHT SO YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHETHER IT'S STILL 210% OR WHETHER IT'S BEEN INCREASED. IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST NEED TO KNOW YEAH I CAN I CAN EASILY OTHER COLLEAGUES TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO READ BACK YOUR CHRISTENING UP YOU WERE GOING TO PLAN. YEAH CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS AS I CAN TO CREATED THIS IS. THE PROPOSED- INFUSION GENERAL FUND IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE EXISTING- AGENCY PROGRAM SO THERE'S NO PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE SATISFIED BUT- AGAIN WE CAN CONFIRM THAT WAY R. O. PR CAL. COLLEAGUES THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO MY POINT THERE IS THAT. IN THE PAST. THAT CAN PERCENT SET ASIDE WAS CREATED WHEN I WAS ON THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AND SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE NO RURAL COMMUNITIES COULD QUALIFY. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU COME IN WHEN YOU CREATE A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE AWARD IS GIVEN. TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE. YOU'RE pAND YOU WILL NEVER EVER HAVE ENOUGH POINTS IN ORDER TO BE TO QUALIFY SO. SO THE PROGRAM DISCRIMINATED AGAINST RURAL COMMUNITIES WE CREATED A SET ASIDE AND I AND SO IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO ME ON. WHETHER THE SET ASIDE HAS BEEN INCREASE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN OUR DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE IT MAY BE THAT WE WANT THAT. SET ASIDE TO BE IN YEAH INCREASED AND- THE REASON THIS BECOMES PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IS AS WE LOOK AT THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT FUND CATEGORIES WEALTHIER. COASTAL AREAS IS COMPOSED TO THE INNER AREAS OF THE STATE BECOMES PROBLEMATIC THERE ISN'T THE ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND SO THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE QUESTION AND IT IS NOTICED. AND IN IN OUR- OUR SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT AT THAT- THAT THERE THERE ARE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES IN RURAL OR UNDERDEVELOPED AREAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE IF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RESOURCES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT IN THAT WERE WILLING TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF POOR AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL- I THINK THAT'S ALL I. HAVE AS PART OF MY COMMENTS I HAVEN'T NOTED IN A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PLACES BUT I THINK THAT'S THE SUM TOTAL OF ACT THAT ISSUE SO THIS IS A WHOLE DOOR OPEN ITEM. FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THOSE HAVE TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE HUNDRED DAYS SO THAT THE DEADLINE FOR THOSE ACTUALLY SHORTER SO THE COMPLETION DATES VARY DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTUAL CASE ITSELF THEY ALL HAVE TO BE HANDLED WITHIN ONE YEAR.
