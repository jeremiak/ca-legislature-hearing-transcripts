00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:18.764
BRINGING THIS FORWARD- BUT IT

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.233
IS- TOO NARROW TO ME IT DOESN'T

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:23.001
SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND WHETHER

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:25.470
IT WAS A LOOPHOLE OR INTENDED

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:28.206
IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT YOU

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.141

NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. EIGHT

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:34.746
YEARS OLD AT THE TIME- SO I AM

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.249
NOT SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:39.918
EXPERIENCE HERE- BUT I WILL SAY

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:42.954
THAT. YOU KNOW MY SENSE IS THAT

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:45.357
WHEN PEOPLE ARE VOTING ON PROP

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:47.859
THIRTEEN THE FOCUS WAS ON.

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.094
PEOPLE BEING POTENTIALLY PUSH

00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:51.396
UP THEIR HOMES BY HAVING THEIR

00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:52.864
PROPERTY TAXES INCREASE

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.433
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF MODEST

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.903
MEANS ARE ON FIXED INCOMES I

00:23:57.969 --> 00:23:59.304
DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE NUTS

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:02.140

00:24:16.021 --> 00:24:17.455
REGARDLESS OF WHAT WAS INTENDED

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:18.957
OR WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:22.227
LOOPHOLE- RIGHT THE REALITY IS

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.094
THAT WE HAVE A VERY INEQUITABLE

00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:26.464
SYSTEM NOW- AND WE HAVE. THE

00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:29.334
ABILITY OF- PARTICULARLY LARGER

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:37.008
THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN'T. WRITE

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.844
HOMEOWNERS IT'S NOT REALLY

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.712
POSSIBLE TO STRUCTURE

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.947
TRANSACTIONS IN A WAY THAT

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:45.717
AVOIDS PROP THIRTEEN RECESS ON-

00:24:45.784 --> 00:24:48.353
AND THAT'S ABOUT. VERY IT'S NOT

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.021
A RESULT THEY WERE GIVING NOT

00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:53.391
JUST. THE SAME BUT EVEN MORE

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:54.559
PROTECTION THE COMMERCIAL

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:57.062
PROPERTIES- THE OTHER PIECE OF

00:24:57.128 --> 00:24:57.929
IT THERE'S A HUGE INEQUITY

00:24:57.996 --> 00:25:01.399
AMONG. A BUSINESSES AND AGAIN

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:02.200
KEEPING IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.902
WHAT I KNOW BEST THAT YOU KNOW

00:25:03.969 --> 00:25:05.570
YOU HAVE THE SALES FORCE TOWER

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:19.718
HAVING TO HAVING THAT KIND OF

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:22.087
IN EQUITY AND THEN ON TOP OF

00:25:22.153 --> 00:25:24.656
ALL THAT EXIST PHILOSOPHICALLY.

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:26.358
SHOULD LARGE COMMERCIAL

00:25:26.424 --> 00:25:28.526
BUILDINGS RECEIVE PROP THIRTEEN

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:30.462
PROTECTION AGAIN THE ANSWER IS

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:32.330
NO- AND I THINK WE SHOULD

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:34.499
