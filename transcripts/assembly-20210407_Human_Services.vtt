BEYOND THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.360
QUESTION NUMBER TWO QUESTION

IS- NOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.465
HELPING OUT WITH THIS A GRANT-

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:13.702
DO CHIPMAN GAP IN THE SCHOOL-

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.370
HOW DO YOU DEFINE ACHIEVEMENT

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:18.340

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:30.585
I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE INTEREST

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:31.753
AS A PRE- I THINK THE GRAND. IS

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:35.290
ALSO APPRECIATED- AS FAR AS THE

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.692
NUMBERS I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:37.859
DECISION FOR THE BUDGET

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.661
COMMITTEE TO REALLY DETERMINE

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:40.128
WHAT THAT NUMBER WILL

01:16:40.195 --> 01:16:42.464
ULTIMATELY BE. IF WE LOOK AT

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.266
THE GRAND SCOPE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:48.003
AND WHAT WE SPEND FOR ANTI

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.906
POVERTY MEASURES FOR EDUCATION-

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:52.307
WHICH I THINK IS A HUGE ANTI

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:53.709
POVERTY MEASURE RIGHT WE'RE

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:55.243
SPEAKING IN THE THAT TENS AND

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.813
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS UP

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.582
MORE THAN THAT RIGHT SO. THIS

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:02.985
IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY- TO TRY

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.921
TO IDENTIFY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.156
MAKING GOOD INVESTMENTS AND SO

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.458
WE ARE WE ARE INVESTING YOU

01:17:09.524 --> 01:17:10.592
KNOW PROBABLY A HUNDRED BILLION

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.361
PLUS IF YOU START TO TALK ABOUT

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.429
HEALTH CARE AS WELL- SO WE'RE

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:15.697
TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.933
TALK A LOT ABOUT NOT MAKING-

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.301
THE LACK OF MAKING. DATA

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:21.870
INFORMED DECISIONS AND THIS IS

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:23.271
JUST A VERY SMALL EFFORT TO DO

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:27.642
THAT- SO I AGAIN I WILL LEAD-

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.411
LEAVE THE TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.913
AND- THE GRANT MAKING PROCESS

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.748
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.516
CREATING TO REALLY IDENTIFY HOW

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:37.152
TO. DO THAT PASSED I DON'T WANT

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:38.553
TO LEGISLATE EXACTLY HOW IT'S

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.689
DONE BECAUSE- THEN THEY'RE

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:45.127
STUCK WITH IT- AND WE'VE SEEN

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:46.061
THAT THE ERRORS OF THAT WAY. SO

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:49.197
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. OR WILL

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:53.235
BE DETERMINED. BASED UPON THE

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.137
TARGET NUMBER OF ALL PEOPLE WHO

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:59.741
MAY- BE ABLE TO GET THE

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.510
BENEFITS OF FROM THIS- PROGRAM

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.445
WELL I WISH THAT WE COULD MAKE

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.613
DECISIONS THAT WAY BUT I THINK

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.381
THAT WE ARE SIXTY MILLION

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.016
DOLLARS YOU IDENTIFIED YEAH

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.053
BASED UPON WHAT- A DATA HAVE

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.255
YOU PROPOSED TO SIXTY MILLION

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:15.991
DOLLARS FOR TWO YEARS SO THIS

01:18:16.058 --> 01:18:17.192
IS REALLY GOING TO BE INFORMED

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:18.827

UNDERSTANDING DATA- I DON'T

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.406
THINK THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IS

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.176
LIMITED- NECESSARILY BECAUSE

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.811
DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING

01:18:35.877 --> 01:18:36.912

THIS BILL WILL BE FOR THE STATE

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:09.529
TO BEGIN COLLECTING DATA ON THE

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:10.430
USE OF SUSPENSION AND

OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING. THIS

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:23.076
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT. THE BILL HAS

01:51:23.143 --> 01:51:25.111
NO KNOWN OPPOSITION AND IS

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:26.212
INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:28.114
EARLY LEARNING AND CARE MASTER

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:28.882
PLAN RELEASED EARLIER THIS

01:51:28.948 --> 01:51:32.318
YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:33.753
IT'S A BILL THAT'S NEAR AND

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.990
DEAR TO ME I- SPENT SIXTEEN

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.258
SIXTEEN YEARS AS A TEACHER

01:51:38.324 --> 01:51:38.792
THREE OF THOSE AS A

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.760
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND- I CAN

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:43.296
TELL YOU. FIRSTHAND THAT YOU

01:51:43.363 --> 01:51:45.131
CAN ALWAYS TELL WHICH KIDS COME

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:46.766
IN WITH TRAUMA AND WHICH DON'T

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.635
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO

01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:49.469
ADDRESS THE TRAUMA WE WERE

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:51.538
EXPECTED TO. TEACH EVERY CHILD

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.540
THE SAME WAY AND SO FOR ME THIS

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:54.741
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:56.109
WE'RE ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:58.111
THE CAUSE. AND NOT JUST FOR THE

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.212
CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES BUT

01:51:59.279 --> 01:52:00.980
THEY'RE ASSISTING THE TEACHERS

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:01.648
WHICH I THINK IS A CRITICAL

01:52:01.714 --> 01:52:03.950
COMPONENT. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL

01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:05.385
NOT GOOD TEACHERS KNOW A LOT

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:07.187
BUT WE DON'T WE'RE NOT A MENTAL

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:08.455
HEALTH PROVIDERS AND SO THIS

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:09.556
GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:52:09.622 --> 01:52:11.291
PROVIDE THOSE. THAT ASSISTANCE

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.460

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:47.500
CHILD. SO THIS ONE IS A

02:01:47.566 --> 02:01:50.636
PROHIBITING UNLESS A FEW.

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:51.937
EXCEPTIONS TO WHICH OUR WHEN I

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:56.275
HEAR ABOUT. WELL AND OBVIOUSLY.

02:01:56.342 --> 02:02:00.346
THE DECIDE TO FOR EXAMPLE WERE

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:03.049
ARRESTED BEHAVIOR- IF THE CHILD

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:05.651
CARE TIPS ON- MANY DIFFERENT

02:02:05.718 --> 02:02:07.353
FORMS OF AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:10.122
LIKE CRICKETING CONSISTENTLY.

02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:12.825
AND THAT THERE'S A DEAL TO SIDE

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:15.761
OF ALL EQUATION VICTIMS MMHM

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:18.898
OKAY MAYBE WE CAN CALL IT. EVEN

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:21.333
THOUGHT THIS CHILDREN BORN MAY

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:21.934
NEED THAT ON ON WHAT THEY ARE

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:25.538
DOING. UNTIL THEY BECOME OLDER

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:27.473
SO AT THIS A LITTLE CHILDREN

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.841
THIS IS JUST A DIFFERENT

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:31.077
PERSONALITY CHARACTER

02:02:31.143 --> 02:02:34.447
EXHIBITING THAT KIND OF THINGS.

02:02:34.513 --> 02:02:36.749
AND- ON AT UPON DO THAT DON'T

02:02:36.816 --> 02:02:39.719
AS THE GOOD COUPON. BUT IF

02:02:39.785 --> 02:02:41.787
YOU'RE A QUESTION A PARTICULAR

02:02:41.854 --> 02:02:43.989
CHARGES SO CONTINUES TO BE

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:47.727
HARASSED OR BULLIED. ARE THERE

02:02:47.793 --> 02:02:50.362
SOME VICTOR. AND THE CHILD IS A

02:02:50.429 --> 02:02:53.032
PROHIBITED FROM BEING EXPELLED

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:55.301
INTO CONTINUOUSLY COMES INTO

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.836
YOUR CHILD HAPPENS TO BE THE

02:02:56.902 --> 02:03:00.773
VICTIM AND CONTINUES TO HARASS

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.942
YOUR CHILD IS A MENTAL. SPATTER

02:03:03.008 --> 02:03:05.111
SO WILL BE DAMAGED. AND JUST

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:07.146
START START THE PSYCHOLOGICAL

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:11.784
DAMAGE OR BE YOU KNOW HONG. CAN

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:13.719
YOU EXPLAIN THAT ASPECT YOU AT

02:03:13.786 --> 02:03:14.787
THE SIDE OF THE EQUATION

02:03:14.854 --> 02:03:16.388
ABSOLUTELY- WELL FIRST AND

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:17.356
FOREMOST THE CHILDREN WE'RE

02:03:17.423 --> 02:03:18.390
TALKING ABOUT ARE THREE AND

02:03:18.457 --> 02:03:19.959
FOUR YEAR OLDS AND- THROUGH THE

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:20.993
STATISTICS THAT WE WERE

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.062
REVEALING ONE OF THEM THE MAJOR

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:24.864
CAUSES OF THE EXPLOSION HAS

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:27.066
BEEN BITING- IF YOU LOOK AT A

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:29.335
DEVELOPMENTAL CHARRED- THREE

02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:30.703
AND FOUR YEAR OLDS BITE BECAUSE

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.837
THEY CAN'T EXPRESS THEMSELVES

02:03:31.904 --> 02:03:33.272
AND COMMUNICATE. SO THAT'S THE

02:03:33.339 --> 02:03:34.006
ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.808
EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION OR ANY

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.376
YOU KNOW ANY OTHER ANYTHING

02:03:37.443 --> 02:03:38.677
THAT'S GOING ON AT HOME SO

02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:40.146
THAT'S A PRIMARY YOU KNOW

02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:41.781
WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT TO

02:03:41.847 --> 02:03:42.314
THIRTY THREE AND FOUR YEAR

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:44.984
OLDS- BUT TO YOUR POINT AS A

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.885
TEACHER IS A FORMER

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:47.953
KINDERGARTEN TEACHER I CAN TELL

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:48.687
YOU THAT I CAN HAVE THE BEST

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:50.856
PLANS AND THAT- AND ONE DAY AND

02:03:50.923 --> 02:03:52.057
ONE CHILD CAN DISRUPT THE WHOLE

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:54.160
ENTIRE DAY. SO WHEN WE WERE

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:55.127
WORKING ON THIS BILL I TOOK

02:03:55.194 --> 02:03:56.896
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THE

02:03:56.962 --> 02:03:58.764
PROBLEM IS THAT THAT WE CAN

02:03:58.831 --> 02:03:59.965
EXPEL CHILDREN AND THEY'RE

02:04:00.032 --> 02:04:01.500
REALLY NOT GETTING ANY KIND OF

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:03.269
SERVICES WERE JUST REMOVING

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:05.638
THEM FROM THE SITUATION AND ARE

02:04:05.704 --> 02:04:06.605
NOT ONLY ARE WE REMOVING THEM

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:07.807
FROM THE SITUATION THEIR GAIN

02:04:07.873 --> 02:04:09.475
CONDITION THAT IF THEY ACT THIS

02:04:09.542 --> 02:04:11.844
WAY THEY GET TO GO HOME. RIGHT

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:13.679
SO NOW WE'RE ENCOURAGING BY BY

02:04:13.746 --> 02:04:14.847
SENDING THEM HOME WE'RE REALLY

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:16.949
PROMOTING THE FACT THAT HEY IF

02:04:17.016 --> 02:04:18.484
YOU DO THIS YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:04:18.551 --> 02:04:20.319
TO GO HOME AND SO THAT'S ALSO

02:04:20.386 --> 02:04:22.121
DETRIMENTAL TO THE EDUCATION OF

02:04:22.188 --> 02:04:23.722
THAT CHILD AND TO YOUR POINT

02:04:23.789 --> 02:04:24.824
ABOUT THE OTHER KIDS IN THE

02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:27.126
CLASSROOM YOU ARE CORRECT. THE

02:04:27.193 --> 02:04:29.128
POINT TO THIS BILL IS THAT IT'S

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:30.563
NOT JUST PREVENTING THE

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:32.131
EXPULSION ARE THE SUSPENSION

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.166
BUT IT'S ALSO PROVIDING THE

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.302
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR ED

02:04:36.368 --> 02:04:37.837
TRADITIONALLY WE'VE ONLY DONE

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:39.638
IT TO THE CHILD INTO THE FAMILY

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:41.473
AS IF TEACHERS MAGICALLY KNOW

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.775
HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS AND THEY

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.243
DON'T. SO THAT MENTAL HEALTH

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:47.046
CONSULTATION TAKES THE THREE

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.380
COMPONENTS THAT CHILD THE

02:04:48.447 --> 02:04:49.949
FAMILY AND THE TEACHER BECAUSE

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.383
A LOT OF TEACHERS LIKE I SAID

02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.384
I'M AN EXPERT AT A LOT OF

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:55.554
THINGS OR I CAN TEACH A LOT OF

02:04:55.621 --> 02:04:57.523
CONTENT BUT I DON'T I'M NOT

02:04:57.590 --> 02:04:59.458
QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE ANY MENTAL

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.826
HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN

02:05:00.893 --> 02:05:02.695
BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE CHILD CAN

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:04.663
BE ACTING UP- AND YOU THINK

02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:06.365
THEY'RE JUST BEING BULLIES. BUT

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:07.433
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE EATEN IN

02:05:07.499 --> 02:05:11.503
THE MORNING. MOM AND DAD GOT

02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:12.137
INTO A FIGHT IN THE EVENING YOU

02:05:12.204 --> 02:05:12.771
KNOW WE ARE HOLD. OF THIS THAT

02:05:12.838 --> 02:05:13.973
THE IN AND THE CHILDREN DON'T

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:14.874
KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.141
ESPECIALLY THREE AND FOUR YEAR

02:05:16.208 --> 02:05:17.476
OLD. SO THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:19.078
COMPONENT NOT ONLY HELPS THE

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:21.714
CHILD AMBER THE FAMILY. BUT

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:24.250
ALSO THE TEACHER. TO DEFLECT

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:25.885
THE SITUATION DIFFUSE IT AT A

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:27.386
DIFFERENT WAY. BUT IT'S NOT

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.321
JUST. A CHART OF THIS IS WHAT

02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:31.957
YOU DO THIS IS. SPECIFICALLY

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.726
DESIGNED TO SIT WITH THE FAMILY

02:05:33.792 --> 02:05:35.995
WITH A CHILD- THE PARENT AND

02:05:36.061 --> 02:05:38.097
THE TEACHER TO IDENTIFIED THAT

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:40.599
CHILD'S PARTICULAR- WHY THERE.

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:41.500
ARE BEING AGGRESSIVE OR

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:43.269
WHATEVER THAT THE ISSUE MAYBE.

02:05:43.335 --> 02:05:45.604
SO THIS IS NOT. A CHECK OFF

02:05:45.671 --> 02:05:47.673
LIST- THIS IS INDIVIDUALIZED

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:49.475
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THAT

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:50.776
INCLUDES THE TEACHERS SO THAT

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:51.844
THE TEACHER CAN DIFFUSE THE

02:05:51.911 --> 02:05:53.779
SITUATION. NOW IF IT CONTINUES

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:55.047
AND WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT

02:05:55.114 --> 02:05:56.248
WHERE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:05:56.315 --> 02:05:57.850
THEN. THERE THERE SHOULD THERE

02:05:57.917 --> 02:05:59.285
SHOULD BE A MEETING- BETWEEN

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:00.753
THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:01.754
AND THE FAMILY TO TRY TO

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.422
IDENTIFY. IT ARE THERE OTHER

02:06:03.489 --> 02:06:05.658
THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE. AND IF

02:06:05.724 --> 02:06:07.092
NOT. IS THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:08.694
CONSULTATION EVEN HOT OUT

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.262
HELPING AND IF IT'S NOT HELPING

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:11.630
AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE A

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:13.933
MEETING WITH. THE FAMILY. AND

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:15.868
BUT THE PERSONALITIES CALL AND

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:16.835
DECIDE WHAT THE NEXT STEP WOULD

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.971
BE. BUT I THINK AND I BELIEVE

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.139
LIKE I SAID AS A AS A FORMER

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:21.740
TEACHER IS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:06:21.807 --> 02:06:23.008
GETTING TO THE ROOT. OF THE

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:24.810
ISSUE IF WE JUST SEND THEM HOME

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:25.778
YOU'RE JUST SENDING THEM HOME

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:27.646
FOR WHAT. YOU CAN EXPECT. THE

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:29.415
KIDS TO THE CHILD TO COME BACK

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:30.883
THE NEXT DAY AND BE FIXED.

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:32.184
BECAUSE WE HADN'T HAVEN'T

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.686
PROVIDED ANY KIND OF SUPPORT

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:34.586
YOU JUST SENT THEM HOME AND

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:35.587
GUESS WHAT THEY DID ALL DAY.

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:37.022
PLAY VIDEO GAMES WATCH TV

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:39.291
WHATEVER THE ISSUE MAYBE. BUT

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:40.926
NEVER ADDRESS THE ACTUAL ISSUE.

02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:43.862
SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR

02:06:43.929 --> 02:06:45.331
QUESTION THAT. WE CAN TAKE

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.966
STEPS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:06:47.032 --> 02:06:48.534
PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.704
SERVICES- FOR THE TEACHER THAT

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.839
BOTH. THE STUDENT AND THE

02:06:53.906 --> 02:06:55.307
FAMILY TO TRY AND SUPPORT HEM

02:06:55.374 --> 02:06:57.042
THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. IF IT'S

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:58.377
AN EXTREME CASE OF COURSE

02:06:58.444 --> 02:06:59.511
THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED

02:06:59.578 --> 02:07:02.181
LATER- AND IN TERMS OF THE

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:03.349
CHILDREN THAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:07:03.415 --> 02:07:04.783
ABOUT BEING VICTIMIZED. IF WE

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.719
DON'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES. RIGHT

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:11.357
NOW. THAT CHILD. IS GOING TO

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:11.957
CONTINUE IN KINDERGARTEN FIRST

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:12.825
GRADE SO GET INVENTOR GRADE-

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:15.561
ACT. OUT THIS. SO YOUR CHILD-

02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:16.795
THAT YOU WERE THINKING MIGHT BE

02:07:16.862 --> 02:07:17.663
A VICTIM RIGHT NOW MAY BE A

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:19.465
VICTIM FOR CAN TO FIRST AND

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:20.299
SECOND AND THIRD GRADE BECAUSE

02:07:20.366 --> 02:07:21.767
WE'RE NOT FIXING THAT. OR AT

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.869
LEAST ASSISTING THE CHILD AND

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:25.137
WHATEVER ISSUES THAT THEY'RE

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:27.806
HAVING. AND SO. AS A TEACHER I

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:29.408
CAN TELL YOU THAT IT AGAIN I

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.343
CAN HAVE THE BEST LESSON PLANS.

02:07:31.410 --> 02:07:32.678
AND ONE CHILD CAN DISRUPT THE

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:34.480
WHOLE ENTIRE DAY BUT UNLESS WE

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:36.148
ACTUALLY TREAT WHATEVER THE

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:37.549
ISSUE IS. AND INSTEAD OF JUST

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:38.650
IGNORING IT AND THEY JUST GO

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:40.152
HOME. AND THEY COME BACK THE

02:07:40.219 --> 02:07:41.487
NEXT DAY YOU HAVEN'T FIXED

02:07:41.553 --> 02:07:43.756
ANYTHING SO. BUT MY HOPE IS AND

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.858
I THINK- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:46.458
GOING WITH THIS IS PROVIDING

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:48.594
MENTAL HEALTH- CONSULTATION.

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:49.862
WILL HELP THE PARENT THE

02:07:49.928 --> 02:07:52.031
STUDENT AND THE TEACHER TO TRY

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:54.566
AND- IDENTIFY WHAT THE ISSUES

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:55.901
ARE. AND IF THERE ARE EXTREME

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:57.870
CASES OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO SIT

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:58.904
DOWN WITH THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL

02:07:58.971 --> 02:08:00.806
AND FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT. A

02:08:00.873 --> 02:08:03.976
DIFFERENT- A WAY OF ADDRESSING

02:08:04.043 --> 02:08:05.411
THOSE ISSUES BUT SENDING THEM

02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:06.512
HOME DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.714
ANYBODY. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:11.316
QUESTION. ON THAT BRING SAMPLE.

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:16.622
NEXT TO LEVEL OR- A QUESTION-
