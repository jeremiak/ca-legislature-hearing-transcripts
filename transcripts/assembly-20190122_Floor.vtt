WHEN ASKED WHAT WHERE SOME OF

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:20.036

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.759
IMMORAL?

THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO I'M

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.305
I'M OKAY WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE

TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING --

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:00.009
BUT THE ONE THING THAT HAS

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:01.711
ALWAYS BOTHERED ME IS THAT THIS

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.079
RESOLUTION IS BROUGHT UP AND

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.847
THERE IS MUCH DISCUSSION.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:07.416
ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN TO

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.951

DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF

01:03:16.225 --> 01:03:18.794
THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE YET.

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:19.695

UNDERSTOOD WHY THAT IS.

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.471
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.473
IN THESE CHAMBERS ABOUT

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.974

THEY HAVE NO VOICE.

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.556
AND TO THOSE SITTING IN THE IN

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.758
THE GALLERY IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:51.194
THEY HAVE NO ADVOCATES HERE.

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.495

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:18.921
CONVERSATION --

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.022
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING

MY WIFE AT THE TIME IF YOU WERE

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.961
TO BECOME PREGNANT.

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.596
WHAT WOULD WE DO WHAT WHAT

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.665
WHAT'S THE DECISION OF WHETHER

01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:31.233
WE'RE VERY EMPHATIC IN OUR

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.634
DECISION TO SAY THAT I SHOULD

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:33.769
HAVE DOES BECOME PREGNANT

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.270
ABORTION WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:36.705
WE WERE GOING TO PURSUE WE WERE

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:37.606
GOING?

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:38.373
TO HAVE THE BABY --

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.975
NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.044
WOULD BE WHETHER WE FELT WE ARE

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:43.779
MAYBE READY OR NOT BUT THE

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.280
IMPORTANCE OF ROE V. WADE WAS

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:47.149
THAT IT GIVES US GAVE US THE

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:48.717
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:49.651
AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE WEIGHT

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:51.386
IS ABOUT AS HAVE HAVING THAT

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:52.621
OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE FOR

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:54.423
YOURSELF I AGREE AS A MAN I

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:55.757
THINK IT'S IT'S JUST NONE OF MY

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.392
BUSINESS TO TELL A WOMAN WHAT

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.061
THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH THEIR

01:14:59.127 --> 01:14:59.995
BODY THAT IS JUST NOT MY

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:00.896
BUSINESS.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:04.366
AND TO TO NOW HAVE THE SITUATION

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.667
THAT WE HAVE --

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:07.236
RIGHT NOW WITH THIS ISSUE COMING

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.470
BACK UP YOU JUST NEED TO

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:09.671
REMEMBER THAT.

01:15:09.738 --> 01:15:11.773
THIS DOESN'T SAY THAT EVERYONE

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.408
HAS TO BE PRO CHOICE THIS ROBY

01:15:13.475 --> 01:15:14.710
WAY GIVES EVERYBODY THE

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:15.510
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:16.879
DECISION FOR THEMSELVES YOU WANT

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:17.646
TO BE PRO LIFE.

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.681
YOU CAN BE PRO LIFE YOU CAN BE

01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:21.216
PRO LIFE WITHIN YOUR OWN FAMILY

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.784
AND MAKE THAT CHOICE TO NOT GET

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.353
AN ABORTION IF YOU WANT TO BE

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:25.420
CHOICE AND YOU WANT.

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.222
TO X. EXPERIENCE OR NOT

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.024
EXPERIENCE BUT MAKE THE DECISION.

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.192
TO GET AN ABORTION YOU HAVE THE

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.560
RIGHT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AND

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.062
THAT'S WHAT THE LAW SHOULD BE.

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.464
TO TO ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THAT

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.698
CHOICE FOR YOURSELF AS AN

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:38.166
INDIVIDUAL TO ALLOW YOU TO

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.368
DISCUSS THAT WITH YOUR FAMILY

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:40.903
AND MAKE THAT DECISION WITHIN

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.104
YOUR FAMILY.

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.739
AND I CANNOT THINK OF SOMETHING

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.407
MORE INAPPROPRIATE FOR A

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:46.842
GOVERNMENT TO DO THAN TO COME

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.243
INTO YOUR BEDROOM IN TO MAKE

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.811
THAT DECISION FOR YOU.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:50.812
OR TO TAKE THAT DECISION AWAY

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:53.081
FROM YOU SO I I OBVIOUSLY

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:54.816
SUPPORT ROE V. WADE AND I THINK

01:15:54.883 --> 01:15:56.418
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS BODY AND

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:57.419
FOR THE STATE TO RECOGNIZE ITS

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:58.921
IMPORTANCE NOT JUST IN THE STATE

01:15:58.987 --> 01:16:02.324
BUT NATIONALLY.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:02.925
AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.626
AYE VOTE [inaudible]

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.128
MR STONE.

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:06.428
YOUR RECORD.

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.329
THANK YOU.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:07.930
AS AN ALL WHITE MAN I THINK I

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:10.065
NEED TO EXPLAIN --

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.300
MAYBE.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.435
MAYBE MAYBE NOT [inaudible]

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.804
IT.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.372
BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR OUR

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.907
COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO SPEAKING

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.509
ABOUT CHOICE.

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.010
AND SPEAKING ABOUT THE JOURNEY

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:24.046
THAT HIS FAMILY WENT THROUGH.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.647
BECAUSE REALIZE MOST WOMEN FACE

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.816
WITH THIS CHOICE.

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.751
DON'T CHOOSE AN ABORTION.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.454
AND IN FACT WE HEARD THIS BILL.

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:33.622
IN THE COMMITTEE I WAS KIND OF

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.424
ASTONISHED AT THE OPPOSITION

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:35.991
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION WAS

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.125
REALLY MORE FOCUSED ON PLANNED

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:39.328
PARENTHOOD.

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:40.329
AND THEY USED THE TERM THAT WAS

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:42.130
REALLY NEW TO ME THE ABORTION

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:44.266
INDUSTRY.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.300
WHICH WAS A REAL LACK OF

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:46.335
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S WHAT'S AT

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.036
STAKE.

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.071
AND WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE

01:16:49.137 --> 01:16:50.138
BECAUSE WHAT PLANNED PARENTHOOD

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:51.540
PROVIDES.

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:52.641
IS SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.409
LOW COST.

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.545
HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:16:56.611 --> 01:16:57.412
TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT HAD HEALTH

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:59.948
SERVICES.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:00.582
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY WE'RE TALKING

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:01.650
ABOUT HERE.

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.151
WHAT I APPLIED PLANNED

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.153
PARENTHOOD FOR BEING ONE OF THE

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.989
FEW VENUES?

01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:09.224
THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES CHOICE

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.526
[inaudible] TWO ONE THAT'S WHAT

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:13.095
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT ROE VERSUS

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.863
WADE IS ABOUT.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.099
IS SAYING FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:19.001
GET OUT OF THE DECISION.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.802
PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:23.005
DECISION A WOMAN HAS TO MAY.

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.506
AND TO THINK THAT SHE IS NOT

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.575
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT.

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:28.643
THE ON BOARD THE CHILD THAT SHE

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.045
IS CARED IF THE THINK SHE

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:30.612
DOESN'T HAVE THAT CONNECTION

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:30.912
[inaudible]

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:31.913
WELL [inaudible]

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.815
IS.

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:36.685
AS I'M TOLD AND AS HIVE LEARNED.

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:39.788
COMPLETELY UNTRUE.

01:17:39.855 --> 01:17:41.990
SO FOR US TO STAND HERE AS A

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:44.126
BODY AS MEN.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.894
WE SHOULD BE DEFERRING TO THE

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.929
STORIES TO THE PERSPECTIVES TO

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:50.032
THE EMOTION THAT'S INVOLVED.

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:50.899
AND NOT TAKE ANY OF IT FOR

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.602
GRANTED.

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.604
ROE VERSUS WADE WHICH IS UNDER

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.806
ASSAULT AND THERE ARE IN FACT

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.274
MANY RIGHTS.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.909
BETTER UNDER ASSAULT THE

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.377
CALIFORNIA'S TRYING TO PROTECT

01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:04.346
OF OUR PEOPLE.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:05.514
WHICH IS WHY WE WORK SO HARD THE

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.815
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SPACE ON THE

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:08.116
CHILD WELFARE SPACE ON SO MANY

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.384
OTHER THINGS TAKE TAKE TAKE CARE

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:10.752
OF FAMILIES.

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:13.021
THAT DO MAKE THAT DECISION. TO

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.357
HAVE A CHILD AND WHO STRUGGLE

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:16.258
WITH BEING ABLE TO RAISE THAT

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:19.628
CHILD.

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:20.929
SO WE NEED TO SUPPORT.

01:18:20.996 --> 01:18:22.864
PEOPLE'S DECISIONS TO TAKE

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:23.999
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.567
SELVES AND THEIR OWN BODIES

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:27.335
THAT'S REALLY WHAT ROE V. WADE

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.037
IS ABOUT IT'S REALLY.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:30.672
THE SIGNIFICANT PIECE OF IT IT'S

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:32.040
REALLY ALL IT IS ABOUT IS ABOUT

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.175
CHOICE.

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:36.011
AND WHO GETS TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:41.316
SO I STAND SUPPORT OF HR.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.819
SIX ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:47.923
ON THE RESOLUTION HAVING SEIZE.

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:48.590
MISTER MONEY MAY CLOSE

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:48.890
[inaudible]

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.959
THANK YOU.

TODAY WE'VE HEARD OTHER

01:18:52.094 --> 01:18:53.628
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WITH

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:55.130
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES DIFFERENT

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:56.264
VOICES.

01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.599
BUT THE THEMES ARE THE

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.768
IMPORTANCE OF CHOICE.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:01.103
AND HOW MUCH THE STATE OF

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.838
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO STAND%

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.806
BEHIND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.609
AS WOMEN TO MAKE THAT CHOICE NO

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.444
MATTER HOW COMPLICATED.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.513
OR HARD THAT DECISION CAN BE IT

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.715
IS OUR DECISION.

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:15.217
IT'S ALSO THE FORTY SIX YEAR

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.985
ANNIVERSARY.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.521

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.030
DECISION.

01:19:29.097 --> 01:19:31.066
NEXT YEAR WILL LIKELY NOT BE THE

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.134
EXCEPTION.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:33.668

RHETORIC AND THE CONVERSATIONS.

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:40.742

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:43.111
THIS RATE MAY BE TAKEN AWAY FROM

01:19:43.178 --> 01:19:44.045
US.

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.814
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO

REASSURE THE STATE AND THE

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:49.484
TWENTY MILLION WOMEN IN THIS

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:50.652

TO BE THERE FOR SERVICE OR A FEW

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.155
THE STORY IS LIKE THAT OF

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:29.223
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS AND

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.659
ACROSS THE WORLD SOMEBODY WHO

01:30:31.726 --> 01:30:35.496
DOESN'T FEEL FITS THAT BILLING.

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:38.065
HE WAS EIGHTY SAID IN A LINE OF

01:30:38.132 --> 01:30:39.400
TEN CHILDREN.

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:43.604
HE WAS VERY ACTIVE AND ATHLETIC.

01:30:43.671 --> 01:30:46.274
HE WAS FUNNY HE WAS SMART BUT

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:49.477
EARLY ON IN HIS CHILDHOOD HE HAD

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:51.712
DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL HE OFTEN

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:53.381
WAS DISCIPLINE.

01:30:53.447 --> 01:30:55.249
AS A TEACHER MYSELF I THINK BACK

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:58.319
THAT HE PROBABLY DID HAVE ADHD

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:02.089
BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED.

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:05.626
HE WAS BORN TO A TEENAGE MOTHER.

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.929
WHO HAD TEN CHILDREN AND IN THE

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:09.330
TIME THAT HE WAS BORN IN THE

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:12.033
SIXTIES MANY TIMES?

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.302
FAMILIES AT THAT TIME DIDN'T

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:15.937
FEEL THAT THEY COULD.

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.238
APPROACH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:21.108
ASK FOR TESTING AGAIN AS A

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:22.043
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD MOTHER --

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.444
SHE DID LISTEN TO WHAT THE

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.446
TEACHER SAID SO HE WOULD BE

01:31:25.513 --> 01:31:28.649
DISCIPLINE NORMALLY AT SCHOOL

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.251
BUT MANY TIMES AT HOME.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.787
THIS LED TO NOT ONLY ISSUES IN

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:35.256
SCHOOL BUT EARLY INTERFACING

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.124
WITH THE JUVENILE DEPARTMENT

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:38.593
WHERE.

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.162
HE STARTED A PATTERN OF GOING IN

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:43.631
AND OUT OF THE JUVENILE SYSTEM

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.600
AND THAT CONTINUED REALLY THE

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:47.401
REST OF HIS LIFE.

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.604
BILLY WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD A

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.607
YOUNG BOY BEFORE HE WAS EIGHTEEN

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.076
AND LATER A DAUGHTER.

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.111
BUT BECAUSE OF HIS IN IN NOW

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:58.813
WITH THE JUVENILE SYSTEM.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.915
AND BECAUSE OF HIS ADDICTION

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:02.416
ISSUES OF ALCOHOL.

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.552
HIS LIFE CONTINUED ON A PATTERN

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:06.954
OF A DOT DOWN WORLD SPIRAL.

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.456
AND WITH MANY MANY FAMILY

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:10.892
MEMBERS TRYING TO INTERVENE AT

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:13.561
EVERY STEP POSSIBLE.

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:16.297
THERE WAS NO CURE OR FOR SOMEONE

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.565
WITH CHRONIC ADDICTION

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.567
ALCOHOLISM.

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.535
WHICH FOR MANY OF US WHO HAVE

01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:23.337
SUFFERED THAT IN FAMILIES WE

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:24.839
KNOW IT IS A DISEASE.

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:28.676
BUT WHAT WE SEE NOW IS THAT.

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:30.077
WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.946
OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS WE HAVE

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:34.682

PERHAPS SOME TYPE OF SOBER

01:32:36.951 --> 01:32:38.452
LIVING AND YET.

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.788
THEY DON'T RECOVER.

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:43.057
BILLY SUFFERED WITH ADDITIONAL

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.693
ISSUES BECAUSE IF YOU'VE BEEN ON

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.028

CONTINUED IN THE SYSTEM.

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:03.010
AND HOMELESSNESS BECAME AN EVEN

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:06.580
GREATER ISSUE AS HIS MOTHER.

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:09.050
MY MOTHER.

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:11.085
DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BE BY

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:13.788
HIS SIDE THERE STILL WAS NOT A

01:33:13.854 --> 01:33:16.123
PLACE AS SHE LIVED IN --

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.858
A SENIOR CONDO.

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:19.560
SO EVEN WITH HER TRYING TO HELP

01:33:19.627 --> 01:33:21.262
HIM SHE WOULD GET LETTER SAYING

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:23.097
