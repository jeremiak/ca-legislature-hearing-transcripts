00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:54.552
SANTA BARBARA ARE SLIGHTLY OVER

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:56.554
THEIR TARGETS WHEN IT COMES JUST

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:57.455
TO THE STUDENT ENROLLMENT

00:25:57.522 --> 00:26:00.125
LEVELS. THE BILL BEFORE YOU

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:02.027
TAKES OUT THE REFERENCE TO

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:05.063
STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AND-

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.098
FOCUSES ON CAMPUS POPULATION AND

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.501
SO NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT FACULTY

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.202
STAFF ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:14.539
CAMPUS NO UC CAMPUS AS AN EXCESS

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.841
OF THEIR LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:20.378
PLAN TOTAL CAMPUS POPULATION

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:22.247
ESTIMATES. AND WE'RE NOT WE DID

00:26:22.314 --> 00:26:24.849
NOT ASK THAT- I'M SORRY WE ASK

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.252
IN FOR AS YES USE SO I'M SORRY I

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.020
CAN'T ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:30.655
IF THERE ARE SOME CSU CAMPUSES

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.457
THAT ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THEIR

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:35.293
MASTER PLAN ESTIMATES. BUT TO BE

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.930
CLEAR THAT THESE- VISIONS DO

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:41.933
APPLY TO USE PCS USE AND

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.835
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL HIGHER

00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.603
EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS PUBLIC AT

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.738
A PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.406
INSTITUTIONS. LAST OCTOBER FOR

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:50.342
YOU REFERENCES AT PUBLIC HIGHER

00:26:50.408 --> 00:26:52.310
EDUCATION IS BROADLY DEFINED SO

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.045
IT WOULD APPLY TO CAMPUSES AT

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:56.648
ALL THREE PUBLIC STATEMENTS. AND

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:58.750
MY LAST QUESTION IS IN TERMS OF

00:26:58.817 --> 00:27:00.218
THE ITS APPLICATIONS THE SEQUEL

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:02.187
OR CHANGES OR NOT NO CHANGES

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:04.522
WHAT WHAT IS YOUR ANALYSIS DOES

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:06.992
THIS BILL. REVISED PHYSICAL

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:12.497
PROVISIONS AYWAY OR IS SEEK.

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:13.365
WORK LEFT. IN PLACE. I WONDER

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:15.433
THE AS IT DOES CHANGE SOME OF

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.669
THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS SO

00:27:17.736 --> 00:27:20.805
AND- RATHER THAN LOOKING AT. IN

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:23.375
ENROLLMENT IN ISOLATION IT

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:25.744
ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO LOOK AT THEIR

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.612
TOTAL CAMPUS CONTEMPT POPULATION

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.382
THAT IS SOMETHING THEY DO NOW-

00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:32.050
IT JUST GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT

00:27:32.117 --> 00:27:35.220
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO FOCUS. ON

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:37.255
CAMPUS POPULATION WITHOUT HAVING

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.491
TO SPOKE UP ON ANY SUB COMPONENT

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:40.625
OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:43.228
SECRET PROCESS IN ISOLATION AND

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:45.363
ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT HAPPENS IF

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.399
THERE IS A FINDING THAT THEY

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:49.100
HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR CAMPUS

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:51.302
POPULATION TOTALS. IT GIVES

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:53.304
CAMPUSES THESE EIGHTEEN MONTH

00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:56.408
WINDOWS FOR THE COURT- FOR THEM

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:59.210
TO REMEDY SITUATIONS WITHIN THE

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.812
EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE THE

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.814
CAMPUS HAS TO TURN AWAY ANY

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.183
STUDENTS. SO IT IS TRYING TO

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.819
CLARIFY THAT THE SITUATION WENT

00:28:07.886 --> 00:28:09.587
MATERIALIZE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:10.889
BECAUSE CAMPUSES WHAT HAVE THE

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.824
SET EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD SO

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.994
YOU- UNDERTAKE MEDICATION. OKAY

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:19.597
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR- THIS BILL

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.499
REMOVES THAT THE ENROLLMENT

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:25.770
REQUIREMENTS. IN THEIR- IN PLAN

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:29.107
AND IF THEY ARE- EXCEEDING THE-

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:33.878
THE- THE ENROLLMENT CAPS THEN

00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:35.880
ORG ENROLLMENT REQUIRED CRITERIA

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:37.982
IT AND THEY HAVE EIGHTEEN MONTHS

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.317
TO REMEDY THAT WERE TO DO

00:28:39.384 --> 00:28:41.286
ANOTHER IMPACT- AND

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:44.189
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. I

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.957
THINK THAT'S BASICALLY IT RIGHT

00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:47.625
THE EIGHTEENTH MONTH WINDOW I

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:49.894
THINK STARKS WHEN ANTS- IN

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.963
CONNECTION TO A COURT CASE SO

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.531
THAT THIS SPECIFIC INSTANCE

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.500
BEFORE YOU CREDIT REMAINS URIEL

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.702
MATERIALIZE OUT PRIOR TO

00:28:57.769 --> 00:29:00.271
LITIGATION CAMPUS AS CAN-

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.406
BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO THROUGH

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.441
THAT LIKE REGULAR C. CORPUS THAT

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.776
THE WAY YOU SUMMARIZED IT IS

00:29:04.843 --> 00:29:05.610
CONSISTENT WITH OUR

00:29:05.677 --> 00:29:07.011
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WILL

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.546
JUST BE THIS DEFINED PERIOD OF

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.048
TIME UNDER WHICH CAMPUSES MAY

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:11.983
RESPOND. OKAY BUT ENROLLMENT

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:13.451
LEVELS ARE NO LONGER SO THAT

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:15.920
THAT ROMAN REMOVAL IS THAT IS

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:19.157
THAT MINOR CHANGE THAT YOU'RE

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.193
REFERRING TO UNDER SEQUEL. I'LL

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.496
NOT SURE WHETHER YES HAVING A

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:26.197
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.433
BERKELEY COURT CASE WAS THAT

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.602
ENROLLMENT COULD BE THE SOLE

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:32.737
FACTOR TRIGGERING A SEQUEL OF

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:35.106
REVIEW AND ENROLLMENT NOW IN

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:37.208
ISOLATION WILL NOT BE SOMETHING

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:39.043
THAT CAN TRIGGER THE DEFINITION

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.979
OF A SEQUEL PROJECT NONSTICK

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:42.580
WILL REFUSE WILL HAPPEN FOR ALL

00:29:42.647 --> 00:29:44.482
OF THE OTHER REASONS INCLUDING

00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:46.017
THINGS THAT WERE CAMPUS

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:48.520

00:33:24.569 --> 00:33:25.937
AND THERE WOULD BE A JOINT

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.271
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.339
NOTIFICATION WHEN RESTAURANTS

00:33:28.406 --> 00:33:30.241
ARE TRANSFERRED I'M AND THAT

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:31.242
WOULD JUST ALLOW THEM TO MOVE

00:33:31.309 --> 00:33:32.977
MORE QUICKLY I'M AS AS YOU'RE

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:34.679

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:36.647
SYSTEM PROCURED AND IMPLEMENTED.

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.116
WITHIN A SIX MONTH TIME FRAME

00:33:38.182 --> 00:33:39.751
THIS IS A PRETTY SHORT AMOUNT OF

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:42.520
TIME. I'M SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:44.222
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS SURE WELL

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.523
THE SAKE OF WINDOWS HAVE ISSUES

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.658
WITH IT SYSTEMS AYE AYE I THINK

00:33:47.725 --> 00:33:55.900
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT-

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:57.235
TIMES OUT. IN WE'RE MOVING. UP

00:33:57.301 --> 00:33:59.103
FOR THE ONE SO IS THERE. TWO

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.172

TO ACCESS THE FUNDING MORE

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:15.787
QUICKLY. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO AND

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:18.089
I THINK DEPARTMENT FINANCE MIGHT

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:19.757
BE IN A BETTER POSITION BY THE

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.225

SPOT THAT THEY EARNED AT UC

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.624
BERKELEY WE SHOULD AVOID THAT WE

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:49.593
ALL HAVE CONSTITUENTS THAT COULD

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.295
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND BECAUSE

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:53.597
OF OUR ACTION TODAY- THE

00:38:53.664 --> 00:38:55.466

UNIVERSITY HOWEVER. THAT

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:05.443
CONSEQUENCE IN THIS CASE IS NOT

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:07.078
BECAUSE OF THE ANALYSIS

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.213
REQUIREMENTS OF SEEK WHAT THAT

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.615
SEE WHAT REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT IN

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:13.851
CLEAR AND REASONABLE IN FACT

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.686
THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN IN

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.054
PLACE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:18.789
NINE. AND THEIR PURPOSE IS TO

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:21.192
CLARIFY AND LIMIT UNIVERSITY

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:23.694
SEQUEL OBLIGATIONS WHEN THEY

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.896
ADOPT THEIR LONG RANGE

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:29.066
DEVELOPMENT PLANS- IN FACT THE

00:39:29.133 --> 00:39:31.202
CONSEQUENCE IN THIS CASE IS THE

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:33.137
DIRECT RESULT OF THE UNIVERSITY

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.271
DISREGARDING THE CLEAR

00:39:34.338 --> 00:39:36.807
REQUIREMENTS TO ANALYZE CHANGES

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.709
IN ENROLLMENT. WITZIG WHICH

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.578
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AT UC

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:43.047
BERKELEY DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:45.416
UC'S DECISION TO EMPHASIZE

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:48.819
ADMITTING OUT OF STATE STUDENTS

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.654
. THIS ISN'T REALLY A SEQUEL

00:39:50.721 --> 00:39:53.190
LITIGATION RUN AMOK BUT A CASE

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.826
WHERE UC BERKELEY DISREGARDED

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.661
THE CLEAR LONGSTANDING

00:39:57.728 --> 00:40:00.531
REQUIREMENT TO PLAN FOR INCREASE

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:02.299
ENROLLMENT. SO WHAT'S OUR

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:04.869
SOLUTION YOU KNOW THIS BILL

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.637
UNFORTUNATELY REWARDS THE

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:09.507
MISTAKES OF THE UC I BUT I HOPE

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.342
THAT OTHER UNIVERSITIES WILL NOT

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.644
COMMIT THESE MISTAKES AND PUT

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:16.747
STUDENTS ADMISSIONS AT RISK. WE

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:19.717
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:22.953
LETTING THEM OFF THE HOOK FOR

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.323
THIS. IS A BILL. YOU KNOW DOES

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.259
NOT ACTUALLY SUBSTITUTE AN

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:30.461
ANALYSIS OF CAMPUS POPULATION

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.563
FOR ENROLLMENT WHAT IT DOES IS

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.198
ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT TO

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.467
ANALYZE ENROLLMENT CHANGES

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:38.969
CREATING AN INCENTIVE TO UNDER

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.138
STATE STUDENT NUMBERS TO REDUCE

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:42.740
PLANNING AND MITIGATION

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:45.643
REQUIREMENTS. I DON'T QUESTION

00:40:45.709 --> 00:40:46.944
THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.679
AUTHORS AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:51.081
THEY INVOLVED OTHER CHAIRS OF

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:53.317
