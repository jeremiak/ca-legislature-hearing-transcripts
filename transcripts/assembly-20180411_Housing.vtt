HOUSING PACKAGE MEAN VERY

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:37.896 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:39.331 region:rollup2
IF OUR STATE RINA ALLOCATIONS

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.565 region:rollup2
ARE NOT EQUITABLE AND DATA

00:31:39.331 --> 00:31:42.234 region:rollup2
DRIVEN.

00:31:40.565 --> 00:31:44.236 region:rollup2
FAIR AND ACCURATE RINA

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:45.303 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS THAT ENSURE EVERY

00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:46.905 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS PLAYING A

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:48.974 region:rollup2
PART IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:50.542 region:rollup2
CRISIS IS THE MAIN GOAL OF AB

00:31:48.974 --> 00:31:52.744 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE. THE

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:55.280 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROCESS TOO OFTEN

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:57.082 region:rollup2
IGNORES THAT DATA THAT DATA AND

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.784 region:rollup2
ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH

00:31:57.082 --> 00:32:00.752 region:rollup2
BACK TO WHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE

00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:02.754 region:rollup2
WITH. RATHER THAN WHAT THEY CAN

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:05.090 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH OUR ACTIONS

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:06.792 region:rollup2
A ACCOMMODATE WITH CHANGES IN

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.726 region:rollup2
THEIR ZONING.

00:32:06.792 --> 00:32:09.861 region:rollup2
IN AN EFFORT TO ADD AN

00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:12.564 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT VOICE AB SEVENTEEN

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:13.632 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE ADDS EIGHT EIGHT CD

00:32:12.564 --> 00:32:14.1000 region:rollup2
TO THE RAIN A PROCESS.

00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:16.468 region:rollup2
THIS ALLOWS THEM TO DETERMINE

00:32:14.1000 --> 00:32:18.069 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION

00:32:16.468 --> 00:32:19.738 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY IS CONSISTENT WITH

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:21.840 region:rollup2
THE LAW BEFORE THE NUMBERS ARE

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:25.243 region:rollup2
EVEN RUN SO THAT THE COG CAN

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.078 region:rollup2
MAKE ANY NEEDED CHANGES WHEN.

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:28.647 region:rollup2
THEY DO THEIR ANALYSIS.

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:31.216 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING PROCESS PROVIDES A

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:32.684 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE THAT CAN ALLOW POLITICS

00:32:31.216 --> 00:32:34.786 region:rollup2
TO OVERWRITE PROCESS Y

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:37.088 region:rollup2
INCLUDING LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:39.324 region:rollup2
FOR A COG TO ADD. ANY OTHER

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:40.458 region:rollup2
FACTORS TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:42.327 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY.

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:44.162 region:rollup2
THIS BILL NARROWS THAT

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:46.431 region:rollup2
DEFINITION AND I IN NO THAT'S

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:48.433 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A VERY VAGUE.

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:51.269 region:rollup2
TERM MANY OTHER FACTORS SO WE

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:52.637 region:rollup2
NARROW THE DEFINITION.

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:54.806 region:rollup2
OF WHAT.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:55.907 region:rollup2
CONSISTS OF ANY OTHER FACTORS

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:58.176 region:rollup2
SO THAT.

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:59.711 region:rollup2
ACOG CAN REQUIRE THAT ALL

00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:01.546 region:rollup2
FACTORS BECAUSE ACOG WILL

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:03.482 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT ALL FACTORS BE

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:05.183 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE

00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:06.785 region:rollup2
STATUTE.

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:08.587 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALLOWS ORGANIZATIONS

00:33:06.785 --> 00:33:09.421 region:rollup2
TO CHALLENGE RINA NUMBERS AS

00:33:08.587 --> 00:33:11.890 region:rollup2
WELL AS SURROUNDING

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:15.060 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS RIGHT NOW.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:16.461 region:rollup2
ONLY THE JURISDICTION THAT IS

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.796 region:rollup2
ASSIGNED ARENA NUMBER CAN

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:19.431 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND AS YOU MIGHT

00:33:17.796 --> 00:33:21.600 region:rollup2
EXPECT.

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:23.235 region:rollup2
THAT RARELY IF EVER HAPPENS

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.636 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:28.506 region:rollup2
RING THAT SETS

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:29.875 region:rollup2
HOUSING ALLOCATION FLOORS NOT A

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.676 region:rollup2
CEILING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:33.378 region:rollup2
GREEN AS A PLANNING TOOL THAT IS

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:35.213 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO SETTING THE STAGE

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:36.815 region:rollup2
FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:38.316 region:rollup2
IF THE PROCESS IS FLAWED THAT WE

00:33:36.815 --> 00:33:40.485 region:rollup2
DON'T GET HOUSING IN THE PLACES

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:42.821 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST AND SOME

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:44.689 region:rollup2
CITIES UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE

00:33:42.821 --> 00:33:45.991 region:rollup2
TO CONTRIBUTE. TO ADDRESSING

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:48.260 region:rollup2
REGIONAL HOUSING UNITS.

00:33:45.991 --> 00:33:49.861 region:rollup2
WHEN JOB RICH DISTRIBUTIONS

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.063 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO PLAN FOR HOUSING

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:53.532 region:rollup2
IT COMPROMISES ARE ABILITY TO

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:55.100 region:rollup2
MAYOR CLAVICLES AS WELL.

00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:56.568 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON GETTING

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.737 region:rollup2
AN EQUITABLE REDISTRIBUTION

00:33:56.568 --> 00:34:01.640 region:rollup2
WITHIN REGIONS THAT ENSURES THAT

00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:03.842 region:rollup2

THIS COMMITTEE QUITE A BIT.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.462 region:rollup2
OTHER IT'S A THE CRISIS ARE

00:34:23.028 --> 00:34:26.064 region:rollup2
COMPLEX AND THERE'S BUT THERE'S

00:34:24.462 --> 00:34:28.500 region:rollup2
NO QUESTION THAT SUPPLY PLAYS A

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:29.801 region:rollup2
ROLE WE NEED TO PRODUCE FARMER

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.735 region:rollup2
HOUSING THAT WE HAVE BEEN AND

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.237 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY HOUSING FOR

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:34.172 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:38.043 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE CURRENT

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:39.010 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE IS ACUTE. ABOUT ONE

00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:39.678 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.211 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW ACCORDING TO THE STATE

00:34:39.678 --> 00:34:40.946 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.947 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:42.614 region:rollup2
BUT IN ADDITION TO PAVING THE

00:34:41.947 --> 00:34:43.248 region:rollup2
WAY FOR MORE PRODUCTION WE ALSO

00:34:42.614 --> 00:34:43.915 region:rollup2
NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE

00:34:43.248 --> 00:34:44.916 region:rollup2
THE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY NEEDED

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.685 region:rollup2
AND ENSURE THAT THOSE PLACES ARE

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:48.620 region:rollup2
PROVIDING AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES

00:34:46.685 --> 00:34:50.722 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PRODUCTION TO HAPPEN.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.123 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE THE RAIN COMES IN.

00:34:50.722 --> 00:34:54.092 region:rollup2
I WAS ADVISED THAT CITY BY A

00:34:52.123 --> 00:34:54.659 region:rollup2
WISE CALLING TO AVOID ACRONYMS

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.860 region:rollup2
BECAUSE EVERYBODY HATES THEM

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:57.429 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.430 region:rollup2
I MANY IS THIS ONE FOR THE SAKE

00:34:57.429 --> 00:34:59.698 region:rollup2
OF BREVITY AND BECAUSE OF THE

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.031 region:rollup2
TERM YOU CAN HEAR A LOT THIS

00:34:59.698 --> 00:35:02.400 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:03.602 region:rollup2
RINA MERELY SERVES SHORTHAND

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.369 region:rollup2
FOR TWO RELATED THINGS THE

00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:05.904 region:rollup2
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:35:04.369 --> 00:35:06.671 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND THE

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:08.540 region:rollup2
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:09.841 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION PROCESS.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.176 region:rollup2
.

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:12.177 region:rollup2
THE STATE DOES THE ASSESSMENT

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:13.578 region:rollup2
PART EVERY EIGHT YEARS A

00:35:12.177 --> 00:35:15.013 region:rollup2
DETERMINES HOW MANY HOUSING UNIT

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:16.748 region:rollup2
THE REGION NEEDS TO PLAN FOR.

00:35:15.013 --> 00:35:17.949 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE CALCULATION

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.050 region:rollup2
HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS ARE YOU

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:21.119 region:rollup2

EXPLAINING PERIOD MINUS HOW MANY

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.088 region:rollup2
HOUSING UNITS YOU HAVE NOW

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:23.722 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE HELPED PLAN

00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:24.956 region:rollup2
FROM THE REGION.

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:25.824 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER THEN GOES TO THE

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.925 region:rollup2
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS FOR THE

00:35:25.824 --> 00:35:28.793 region:rollup2
REGION WHICH HAVE TO ALLOCATE A

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:29.427 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THE REGION HOUSING NEED

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.095 region:rollup2
TO EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.429 region:rollup2
REGION.

00:35:30.095 --> 00:35:33.531 region:rollup2
THIS IS THERE IN A PROCESS THAT

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:34.966 region:rollup2
THAT ISSUE IN THIS BILL HAVING

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:36.401 region:rollup2
IT OUT GETS ALLOCATED WITHIN A

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.902 region:rollup2
REGION IS CRUCIAL TO SETTING THE

00:35:36.401 --> 00:35:38.670 region:rollup2
STAGE FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:40.472 region:rollup2
IN PREPARING THEIR HOUSING

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.272 region:rollup2
ELEMENT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE

00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.574 region:rollup2
TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:44.876 region:rollup2
SAFE ZONE FOR HOUSING WHERE

00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:45.777 region:rollup2
THEIR. ENTIRE SHARE THE RITA

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.544 region:rollup2
COULD BE BUILT.

00:35:45.777 --> 00:35:47.912 region:rollup2
THE LAW RECOGNIZES THAT CITIES

00:35:46.544 --> 00:35:49.047 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES GENERALLY ARE NOT

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:50.215 region:rollup2
IN THE BUSINESS OF HOUSING

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:51.316 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO PLAY A

00:35:50.215 --> 00:35:52.851 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ROLE THROUGH THEIR

00:35:51.316 --> 00:35:54.552 region:rollup2
ZONING POWERS IN SETTING THE

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:56.221 region:rollup2
STAGE FOR DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN.

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:57.288 region:rollup2
THE LAW PROVIDES NUMEROUS

00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:58.790 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS

00:35:57.288 --> 00:36:00.458 region:rollup2
IS MISTER BLOOM NOTED BOTH

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.292 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AND MARKET A PROJECTS

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:02.761 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROPOSED UNSAFE THAT

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:04.295 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY BEEN ZONED FOR

00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:05.530 region:rollup2
HOUSING THESE PROTECTIONS OR

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:06.398 region:rollup2
ENHANCE LAST YEAR THROUGH A

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.599 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF BILLS AND HOUSING

00:36:06.398 --> 00:36:08.800 region:rollup2
PACKAGE. ESSENTIALLY OF

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:10.568 region:rollup2
DEVELOPER PROPOSES A HOUSING

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.102 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN A LOCATION WHERE

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:14.105 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY HAS PLANNED FOR

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:14.773 region:rollup2
HOUSING IT'S VERY VERY HARD FOR

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:18.309 region:rollup2
THAT PROJECT TO GET TONIGHT NOW.

00:36:14.773 --> 00:36:19.310 region:rollup2
.

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.945 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT NONE THESE LAWS CAN

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.247 region:rollup2
COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:24.082 region:rollup2
IN PLACES WHERE THERE IS LITTLE

00:36:22.247 --> 00:36:25.283 region:rollup2
OR NO THE PLANS ON FOR HOUSING

00:36:24.082 --> 00:36:26.484 region:rollup2
OF A JURISDICTION GET THE LOW

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:28.019 region:rollup2
REMAIN NUMBER THAT EFFECTIVELY

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:29.154 region:rollup2
MEANS THE JURISDICTION CAN SHUT

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:31.156 region:rollup2
THE DOOR FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:36:29.154 --> 00:36:32.557 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT DECADE. EVEN EVEN

00:36:31.156 --> 00:36:33.992 region:rollup2
IF IT'S AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:35.527 region:rollup2
NEW HOUSING. THIS IS WHY IT'S SO

00:36:33.992 --> 00:36:37.228 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO GET THE REALLOCATION

00:36:35.527 --> 00:36:39.030 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.698 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED AND A DATA DRIVEN WAY

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.433 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS A VARIETY OF CRITICAL

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.867 region:rollup2
STATUTORY GOALS SUCH AS CLIMATE

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.102 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:45.503 region:rollup2
REDUCING CLIMATE CHANGE

00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:46.738 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY REGIONAL POLITICS

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:48.406 region:rollup2
OFTEN TAKES OVER RESULTING IN

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:49.507 region:rollup2
LOW ALLOCATIONS TO CITIES THAT

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:51.109 region:rollup2
COULD AND NEED TO ACCOMMODATE

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:53.511 region:rollup2
MORE HOUSING BASED ON A LACK OF

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:55.180 region:rollup2
WILL RATHER THAN ACTUAL DATA.

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:56.715 region:rollup2
THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO BURDEN

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.615 region:rollup2
THE COGS OR CREATE MORE WORK

00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:59.250 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALREADY A LOT OF WORK

00:36:57.615 --> 00:37:00.351 region:rollup2
FOR THEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.252 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO TAKE THE POLITICS OUT

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:03.021 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WERE PLANNING FOR

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:03.655 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND.

00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:04.923 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITIES ARE DOING THEIR

00:37:03.655 --> 00:37:06.691 region:rollup2
FAIR SHARE.

00:37:04.923 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMPLICATED TOPIC BUT

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:10.662 region:rollup2
IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WE

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.996 region:rollup2
ASK FOR AYE VOTE.

GOVERNMENTS ARE THE COGS WERE

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:53.037 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RENO

00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:55.340 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION WE APPRECIATE THE

00:37:53.037 --> 00:37:57.175 region:rollup2
INITIAL AMENDMENT BECAUSE THAT.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:59.310 region:rollup2
HELPED ON SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:37:57.175 --> 00:38:01.212 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.813 region:rollup2
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION.

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:04.816 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO JUST KIND OF

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:06.651 region:rollup2
RAISE A COUPLE OF LARGER ISSUES

00:38:04.816 --> 00:38:07.819 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHY WE'VE TAKEN THIS

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:09.654 region:rollup2
POSITION.

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:11.789 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST IS RECONCILIATION

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:12.957 region:rollup2
THE COGS.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:15.527 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DISTRIBUTE THE RENO

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:17.095 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:38:15.527 --> 00:38:19.330 region:rollup2
THE RENO DISTRIBUTION IS

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:23.101 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THE

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:25.303 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGET.

00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:26.271 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE IN

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:28.540 region:rollup2
SOME CASES THE A EQUITY

00:38:26.271 --> 00:38:29.707 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION MAY BE ENTIRELY

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.809 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE GHG

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:32.944 region:rollup2
REDUCTION AND IN SOME CASES IT

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:34.779 region:rollup2
MAY NOT.

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:36.748 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:38.850 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE AT WITH

00:38:36.748 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
THE FACTORS.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:42.921 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRED A A

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.556 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION. THAT IS DIFFERENT

00:38:42.921 --> 00:38:47.292 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THE

00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:48.660 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM GHG REDUCTION WE NEED

00:38:47.292 --> 00:38:50.562 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF RECONCILIATION

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.763 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THOSE TWO. BECAUSE WE'RE

00:38:50.562 --> 00:38:54.933 region:rollup2
PRETTY SURE THAT A A RP IS NOT

00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:56.668 region:rollup2
GOING TO GIVE A REDUCTION BASED

00:38:54.933 --> 00:38:58.236 region:rollup2
ON THAT BECAUSE WE TELEMEDICINE.

00:38:56.668 --> 00:39:00.071 region:rollup2
SO THIS LAW.

00:38:58.236 --> 00:39:01.573 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE RINA IS TIED TO THE

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:03.741 region:rollup2
RESULT TRANSPORTATION PLAN NEEDS

00:39:01.573 --> 00:39:04.876 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT THAT SO THAT'S

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:05.777 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

00:39:04.876 --> 00:39:07.679 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

00:39:05.777 --> 00:39:09.180 region:rollup2
WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. THE

00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:11.182 region:rollup2
SPONSORS OF BEEN SYMPATHETIC TO

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.749 region:rollup2
THAT IN OUR INITIAL CONVERSATION

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:12.217 region:rollup2
SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:13.151 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:15.220 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE AN

00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.688 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH IS INTRODUCING NEW

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.423 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO THE APPELLATE

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:19.290 region:rollup2
TIMELINE.

00:39:18.423 --> 00:39:21.259 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE HOUSING

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:23.828 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:25.830 region:rollup2
WHEN WE NEGOTIATED S. B. THREE

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:27.532 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE THE JXD LA THE.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.067 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX MONTHS LEADING UP TO

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:30.535 region:rollup2
A REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:35.073 region:rollup2
ADOPTION.

00:39:30.535 --> 00:39:36.741 region:rollup2
WAS CAREFULLY TIMELINE IN ANY.

00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:38.543 region:rollup2
DELAY IN THAT PROCESS

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:40.945 region:rollup2
COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO WHO

00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:42.180 region:rollup2
ADOPTED RTP AND ALL THE

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:44.482 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS RELATED

ADDRESSING VERY IMPORTANT

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:53.458 region:rollup2
FACTORS.

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:54.859 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME SIDE EFFECTS TO

00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:56.394 region:rollup2
THIS BILL THAT NEED TO BE WORKED

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:58.596 region:rollup2
OUT SO BEFORE WE CAN REMOVE OUR.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:40:00.531 region:rollup2
.

00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:03.668 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:05.303 region:rollup2

CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED WHICH

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:20.545 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK ARE INSURMOUNTABLE

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:21.145 region:rollup2
AT ALL. ON BILLION APPRECIATION

00:41:20.545 --> 00:41:22.013 region:rollup2

BUT I JUST SAY I APPRECIATE YOU

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:34.959 region:rollup2
TACKLING THIS AREA THERE'S

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:35.526 region:rollup2
LAWLER MAY HAVE

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.830 region:rollup2
SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:41.265 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:44.335 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND I THINK WE'RE LARGELY

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:46.270 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT ACTUALLY WITH TELL

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:48.072 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT THIS.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.407 region:rollup2
WHATEVER WE DO ON RENO NEEDS TO

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:50.308 region:rollup2
SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S CHICHI

00:41:49.407 --> 00:41:51.175 region:rollup2
REDUCTION GOALS AND NOT IMPEDE

00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:52.810 region:rollup2
THEM SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.444 region:rollup2
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TO

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:53.911 region:rollup2
WORK TOGETHER WE THINK THAT'S

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:55.580 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:56.314 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO AGREE THAT

00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.782 region:rollup2
EXTENDING THE TIMELINE WOULD

00:41:56.314 --> 00:42:00.284 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL KINDS OF NEGATIVE

00:41:57.782 --> 00:42:02.019 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES IT WOULD DELAY RTP

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:03.654 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PUT COGS BEEN IN

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:05.890 region:rollup2
TROUBLE WITH THE FEDERAL

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:07.125 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND IT WOULD ALSO.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.726 region:rollup2
DELAY ADOPTION OF HOUSING ON

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:10.495 region:rollup2
INTO THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH WE

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:12.830 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE AND

00:42:10.495 --> 00:42:14.565 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY. ARE LOOKING

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.068 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH FOLKS ON

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:18.236 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE SORT OF GETS MORE

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:21.839 region:rollup2

00:42:18.236 --> 00:42:24.442 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT.

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:26.210 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN WEIGH IN AT THE

00:42:24.442 --> 00:42:29.781 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE STAGE AS WELL SO

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:33.418 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING GETS

00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:16.941 region:rollup2
NEEDED. AND IS NOT A HUGE FIX

00:51:15.306 --> 00:51:18.542 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION ADDRESSES IT

00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:19.843 region:rollup2

EARTHQUAKE HITS.

00:58:16.727 --> 00:58:20.297 region:rollup2
THE CODE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT

00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:21.765 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR WHEN A BUILDING WILL

00:58:20.297 --> 00:58:23.767 region:rollup2
BE USABLE AFTER A LARGE SEISMIC

00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:27.437 region:rollup2
EVEN NEW BUILDINGS ARE EXPECTED

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:29.306 region:rollup2
TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT REPAIR COSTS

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:30.774 region:rollup2
AND DOWNTIME AFTER A MAJOR

00:58:29.306 --> 00:58:32.075 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE.

00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:34.177 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WOULD BE DISPLACED FROM

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:35.545 region:rollup2
THEIR HOMES AND WE WOULD FACE A

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.980 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DESTRUCTION AND TO

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:38.148 region:rollup2
BE JOE ECONOMY.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.916 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A

00:58:38.148 --> 00:58:41.451 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARDS SO

00:58:39.916 --> 00:58:43.553 region:rollup2
THAT A BUILDING'S STRUCTURE

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:45.389 region:rollup2
FINISHES AND SYSTEMS WOULD

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:46.890 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY OR

00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:47.357 region:rollup2
COULD BE RESTORED TO SUPPORT

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.959 region:rollup2
BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE

TIME.

00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:58.935 region:rollup2
IT REQUIRES THE CBSC TO CONVENE

00:58:57.167 --> 00:59:00.804 region:rollup2
A WORKING GROUP TO PROPOSE THE

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:03.774 region:rollup2

00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.213 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT

00:59:08.812 --> 00:59:11.648 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN ENTER BUILDINGS AND

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:13.817 region:rollup2
RESUME NORMAL ACTIVITY SOON

00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:15.719 region:rollup2

OF THE BILL'S LOUDEST ONE TAKE A

00:59:58.028 --> 00:59:59.162 region:rollup2
FEW MINUTES THE HIGHLIGHTS SOME

00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.997 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:02.532 region:rollup2
AT THE KEY POINTS THAT WE FIND

01:00:00.997 --> 01:00:04.668 region:rollup2
SO IMPORTANT ABOUT IT. AND

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:05.435 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY IS DIESEL ADDRESS ANY

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:06.503 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.637 region:rollup2
S. STRUCTURE ENGINEERS WE

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.139 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE CODE INTENT OF

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.740 region:rollup2
LIFE SAFETY.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:11.541 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.943 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE THAT SAME

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:14.311 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CODE INTENT

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.278 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS BUILDUP GOES TO

01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.280 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE AYE

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:18.615 region:rollup2
MISCONCEPTIONS.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.816 region:rollup2
AT FIRST THE BILL REFERS TO A

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.218 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARD IS

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.619 region:rollup2
A NEW IDEA.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.587 region:rollup2
THIS FUNCTION RECOVERY STANDARD

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.721 region:rollup2
DOES NOT MEAN IMMEDIATE

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:26.356 region:rollup2
OCCUPANCY NECESSARILY FOR ALL

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.891 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS.

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.825 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE'RE

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:30.227 region:rollup2
GOING TO SIGN EVERY BUILDING TO

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.761 region:rollup2
BE LIKE A HOSPITAL.

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:33.029 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A ONE SIZE

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.865 region:rollup2
FITS ALL PRESCRIPTIVE APPROACH

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:36.433 region:rollup2
TO THE BUILDING CODE.

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:37.534 region:rollup2
IT'S INSTEAD IT CONSIDERS AN

01:00:36.433 --> 01:00:39.102 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE

01:00:37.534 --> 01:00:41.304 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE FOR EVERY BUILDING.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:42.739 region:rollup2
BASED ON ITS SPECIFIC USE IT

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:44.107 region:rollup2
OF A DOCUMENT SEE IT'S A

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.509 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC IMPORTANCE TO BUILD A

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:47.177 region:rollup2
OF A COMMUNITY TO RECOVER AFTER

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:48.812 region:rollup2
EVENTS.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:50.814 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.982 region:rollup2
PROTECT LIFE SAFETY IS STILL OUR

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.084 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY RECOVER IN A

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:55.218 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL TIME FRAME.

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.386 region:rollup2
THIS WILL LIKELY BE SOME SORT OF

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.954 region:rollup2
SLIDING SCALE TO GIVE SOME

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.755 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY SOME FLEXIBILITY TO

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.723 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:01.892 region:rollup2
DESIGNED FOR DIFFERENT TIME

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:03.493 region:rollup2
FRAMES OF RECOVERY.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.861 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A NEW IDEA. UP

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.729 region:rollup2
PARTS ARE ALREADY IN THE CODE IS

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.997 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD WE'VE WE HAVE

01:01:05.729 --> 01:01:07.931 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND OTHER BUILDINGS

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.065 region:rollup2
ARE DESIGNED FOR IMMEDIATE

01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:10.534 region:rollup2
OCCUPANCY OR SOME SORT OF

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:11.735 region:rollup2
FUNCTION RECOVERY BETTER THAN

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.636 region:rollup2
JUST THE BASIC BUILDING.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:14.104 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:15.372 region:rollup2
BEEN STUDIED AND IMPLEMENTED A

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEVELS OVER THE LAST

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:17.541 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DECADES IN ISRAELI BE

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:20.277 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED TODAY IF WE WANTED

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:21.811 region:rollup2
TO.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.379 region:rollup2
SECOND DOESN'T CHANGE THE CODE

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:23.613 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOESN'T ACTUALLY

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.314 region:rollup2
CHANGE OUR CHO THEY JUST FORCE

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.549 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP IT'S VERY

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.850 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THIS

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:27.984 region:rollup2
TOPIC.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.519 region:rollup2
BUT THIS WORKING GROUP WOULD

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:31.087 region:rollup2
STUDY THE ISSUE CONSIDER THE

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.422 region:rollup2
CHANGES OF ANY THAT MIGHT NEED

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:34.124 region:rollup2
IT'S THE BUILDING CODE.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.891 region:rollup2
THEN MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.693 region:rollup2
TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:37.827 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND EACH CD.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.529 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS THERE IS CONSENSUS

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.363 region:rollup2
WAS IN THAT WORKING GROUP.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.731 region:rollup2
NOW THESE ENTITIES WITHIN

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.666 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED THESE AMENDMENTS ARE

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.601 region:rollup2
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS APART A

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:46.136 region:rollup2
NORMAL CHO PROCESS VERY PUBLIC

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:47.771 region:rollup2
OPEN PROCESS. AND AGAINST A VERY

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:49.406 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO SOMETHING

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.906 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TOPIC

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.241 region:rollup2
FOR BUILDING BECAUSE THE

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING.

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.410 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IF IF

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.644 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS ACTUALLY GOT

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.845 region:rollup2
MADE IN AND IMPLEMENTED IN THE

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:57.180 region:rollup2
CODE.

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.615 region:rollup2
WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.050 region:rollup2
ONLY INCREASE CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:00.617 region:rollup2
ON A LIMITED NUMBER BUILDINGS BY

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.851 region:rollup2
WOMEN'S AMOUNT OF PERCENTAGE

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:03.353 region:rollup2
POINTS.

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.688 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE END IT WILL ACTUALLY

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:06.456 region:rollup2
SAVE MONEY IN THE END.

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.791 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES OVER BY SAVING IN

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.992 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REDUCING THE LOSSES

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:11.027 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW DAMAGE

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.128 region:rollup2
AND RECOVERY TIME.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:13.263 region:rollup2
THEIR NUMBER PROJECT CASE

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:15.031 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT SUPPORT THESE

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:16.466 region:rollup2
CONCLUSIONS WELLS FOR FEDERER.

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:17.934 region:rollup2
REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:19.869 region:rollup2
PRODUCED.

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:20.670 region:rollup2
SEE OCT SUPPORTS THIS BILL AS IT

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:22.138 region:rollup2
STARTS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:24.107 region:rollup2
ABOUT AMY FOR SOMETHING BETTER

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
THAN LIFE SAFETY IT'S LOOKING AT

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:27.310 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. AND

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:28.211 region:rollup2
IMPROVING OUR BUILDING CODES.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.579 region:rollup2
AS IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:30.614 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.249 region:rollup2
WE ENCOURAGE OUR SUPPORT THIS

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.816 region:rollup2
BILL ON HAPPEN ANSWER ADDITIONAL

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.216 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AFTER DOCTOR JONES

01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:34.351 region:rollup2
SPEAKS.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:37.187 region:rollup2

I CAN TELL YOU WITH ABSOLUTE

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.991 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY THAT THERE WILL BE A

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:42.926 region:rollup2
BIGGER. ON THE SAN ANDREAS

01:02:40.991 --> 01:02:43.460 region:rollup2
FAULT.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:45.895 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT STOPPING PLATE

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.364 region:rollup2
TECTONICS.

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:48.832 region:rollup2
I CAN'T TELL YOU QUINN. BUT WE

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:50.500 region:rollup2

TELLING YOU WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.503 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT INEVITABLE EARTHQUAKE

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.405 region:rollup2
COMES ALONG.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:56.806 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL

TO GIVE US LIFE SAFE BUILDINGS

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:19.029 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS THAT DON'T KILL US AND

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:19.029 region:rollup2
THEY'VE DONE THAT

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:24.401 region:rollup2
QUICK THAT'S

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:25.702 region:rollup2
I JUST ONE IN FOUR. MODERN

01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:28.004 region:rollup2
CURRENT CODE BUILDINGS IN THE

01:03:25.702 --> 01:03:28.471 region:rollup2
BAY AREA WILL NOT BE USABLE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.273 region:rollup2
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.543 region:rollup2
AND.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:35.178 region:rollup2
THIS MAY SEEM EXTREME BUT IT IS

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:37.213 region:rollup2
WHAT WE STILL SAW IN NEW ZEALAND

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:39.015 region:rollup2
CHRISTCHURCH NEW ZEALAND HAS

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.150 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS LIKE CARS THAT HAVE

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:40.617 region:rollup2

APPROACHES.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:45.622 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAD THEIR DESIGNED

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:47.190 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE WHAT THE CODE SAYS

01:03:45.622 --> 01:03:47.991 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BILL TO IN TWENTY

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.492 region:rollup2
ELEVEN.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.161 region:rollup2
THE CODES DID WHAT IT WAS

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.896 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO NOBODY DIED IN A

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.197 region:rollup2
MODERN BUILDING.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.532 region:rollup2
BUT ONCE THE DUST SETTLED THEY

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:57.967 region:rollup2
ENDED UP HAVING TO TEAR DOWN

01:03:55.532 --> 01:03:59.235 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED BUILDINGS.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:00.470 region:rollup2

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.272 region:rollup2

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.940 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:05.275 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.177 region:rollup2
BAD THE NEIGHBORS OF BAD

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:09.345 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS NOW DON'T GET TO USE

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:11.014 region:rollup2
THEIR BUILDINGS SEVENTY PERCENT

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:12.082 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL THE BUILDINGS IN THE

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.383 region:rollup2
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT WERE

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:15.285 region:rollup2
DAMAGED. A HUNDRED PERCENT WERE

01:04:13.383 --> 01:04:16.920 region:rollup2
CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE RISK FROM

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:19.389 region:rollup2
THE BAD BUILDINGS.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.423 region:rollup2
WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:22.225 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GET OUR ECONOMY GOING

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:23.927 region:rollup2

OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.960 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN

COMMITTEE MEMBERS SILVIO FOR OUR

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.863 region:rollup2
IN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.865 region:rollup2
BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE

01:06:06.863 --> 01:06:10.333 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.301 region:rollup2
AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.936 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE BEEN HAVING VERY

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:14.671 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:16.206 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS AND

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.273 region:rollup2
I THINK WE DO BELIEVE THAT ARE

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.274 region:rollup2
REMAINING CONCERNS CAN BE

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:20.443 region:rollup2
RESOLVED.

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:22.712 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD ON THE FIRST OF

01:06:20.443 --> 01:06:23.913 region:rollup2
THOSE CONCERNS AND WE REALLY ARE

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:25.014 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PROCESS.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:27.083 region:rollup2
UNDER THE FIRST THOSE CONCERNS

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:28.251 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE VIEW AS A RESTRICTING

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:29.886 region:rollup2
OF THE WORKING GROUPS WERE ALL

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.454 region:rollup2
IN AGREEMENT THAT A WORKING

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.455 region:rollup2
GROUP SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. A IT

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:33.523 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE POPULATED WITH THE

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:35.291 region:rollup2
BEST AND BRIGHTEST IN THESE

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.693 region:rollup2
VARIOUS FIELDS AND THEY SHOULD

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:39.028 region:rollup2
GET TOGETHER NATION INVESTIGATE

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:40.697 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE. BUT THE BILL MAKES A

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:41.931 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION THAT AFTER THAT

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:44.334 region:rollup2
WORK IS COMPLETE THE OUTCOME

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:45.768 region:rollup2
WILL BE MANDATORY BUILDING

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.504 region:rollup2
STANDARDS.

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:48.505 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE'VE

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.039 region:rollup2
SEEN THE PAST PRACTICE ON A HOST

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.808 region:rollup2
OF ISSUES THAT THAT WORKING

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:53.510 region:rollup2
GROUP SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:55.245 region:rollup2
USE THEIR EXPERTISE TO DEVELOP

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.412 region:rollup2
WHAT EVERTHOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:58.481 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE. AND THEY MIGHT BE

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:59.616 region:rollup2
MANDATORY STANDARDS THEY MIGHT

01:06:58.481 --> 01:07:00.550 region:rollup2
NOT BE THEY MIGHT BE VOLUNTARY

01:06:59.616 --> 01:07:02.151 region:rollup2
THEY MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE AND

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:04.454 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK. THAT THE BILL

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:05.421 region:rollup2
SHOULD JUST MAKE THE PRE

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:08.224 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION WHAT THE OUTCOME

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:09.993 region:rollup2
IS. THE SECOND ISSUE REVOLVES

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:11.327 region:rollup2
AROUND THE AGENCY AND ENSURING

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:14.097 region:rollup2
THAT THE AGENCY RETAINS FULL

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:14.430 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY OVER THE PROCESS AND

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.999 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT.

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.867 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE IN THE BILL THAT

01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:19.602 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE WORKING GROUP HAS

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.703 region:rollup2
BEEN GIVEN THE AUTHORITY TO

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:21.804 region:rollup2
DIRECT THE BUILDING STANDARDS

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.805 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:24.207 region:rollup2
HOUSING COMMITTEE IN A

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:25.475 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.943 region:rollup2
WITH STANDARDS.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:28.745 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED WE

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:30.613 region:rollup2
DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW OF.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:31.114 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER WORKING GROUP THAT HAS

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:33.483 region:rollup2
BEEN GIVEN THAT KIND OF

01:07:31.114 --> 01:07:35.952 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY MOST RECENTLY WORKING

01:07:33.483 --> 01:07:36.853 region:rollup2
ON BOTH RECYCLED WATER AND EVEY

01:07:35.952 --> 01:07:38.821 region:rollup2
CHARGING.

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.856 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES TO GREAT WEIGHT

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:41.424 region:rollup2
AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:42.492 region:rollup2
CAME OUT OF THESE EXPERT WORKING

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:44.727 region:rollup2
GROUPS AND WE DON'T SEE THAT

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:46.663 region:rollup2
THERE BE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THIS

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.464 region:rollup2
EITHER. BUT THE IN THE DAY IT IS

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:50.033 region:rollup2
THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:51.467 region:rollup2
TO PROMULGATE THE STANDARDS AND

01:07:50.033 --> 01:07:52.969 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A PROCESS THEY HAVE

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:54.604 region:rollup2
TIME AND WE BELIEVE. THAT

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:56.506 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION SHOULD AND CAN BE

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:57.173 region:rollup2
MADE TO THEM AND THEN THEY MOVE

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:59.075 region:rollup2
FORWARD FOR THE ULTIMATE

01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:01.110 region:rollup2
DECISION BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.612 region:rollup2
THESE PROCESS TYPE ISSUES CAN BE

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:04.514 region:rollup2
RESOLVED WE HOPE TO WORK WITH

01:08:53.463 --> 01:09:00.403 region:rollup2
TESTED AND THE WORKING FINE.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:03.840 region:rollup2
SIZE SAID THERE SO NOTHING IN.

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:06.309 region:rollup2
ALL BREAK A ROUTING EIGHT

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.111 region:rollup2
WORKING GROUP OUT VIA EXECUTIVE

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:12.949 region:rollup2
ORDER NONSENSE SO WE ARE ALL

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:14.717 region:rollup2
AWARE OF THE EARTHQUAKE THAT

01:09:12.949 --> 01:09:15.251 region:rollup2
THREAT.

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.352 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:16.953 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT?

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.588 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL IF IF YOU DON'T

01:09:16.953 --> 01:09:20.523 region:rollup2
START A CONVERSATION THERE WON'T

01:09:18.588 --> 01:09:20.690 region:rollup2
BE ANY ADVANCEMENT.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.558 region:rollup2
SO.

01:09:20.690 --> 01:09:23.960 region:rollup2
.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:26.029 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS DAY IDEA OF THIS

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.530 region:rollup2
BILL I MEAN JUST.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:29.132 region:rollup2
BY THE FACT THAT IT'S A WORKING

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.466 region:rollup2
GROUP.

01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:32.435 region:rollup2
COMING UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:34.070 region:rollup2
TELLS YOU THAT.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:36.139 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT MANDATING ANYTHING AS

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:37.707 region:rollup2
A BODY. WE'RE NOT FORCING ANYONE

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:40.043 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC THING WE'RE JUST

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.510 region:rollup2
SETTING A GOAL OF HOW DO YOU

01:09:40.043 --> 01:09:43.813 region:rollup2
MAKE BUILDINGS NOT BE

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.947 region:rollup2
DISPOSABLE.

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.649 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT COULD CREATE A

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:48.885 region:rollup2
SEVERE.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:51.120 region:rollup2
MARKET DISRUPTION.

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:53.423 region:rollup2
SO. YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.224 region:rollup2
WORKING ON PRE EMPTING THAT

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:57.827 region:rollup2
SEVERE MARKET DISRUPTION LATER

01:09:55.224 --> 01:10:00.730 region:rollup2
ON BY A VERY SMALL MARGINAL.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:02.732 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT UP FRONT.

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.100 region:rollup2
YOU'VE THE BABY DAYS COOLEY I'M

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.901 region:rollup2
SORRY THE ARGUMENT IS THAT THE

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.602 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT COME COMMISSION YOUR

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.937 region:rollup2
YOU CAN WORK WITH THEM AND THEN

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.639 region:rollup2
THEY CAN.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:12.008 region:rollup2
MEAT THOUGH WHAT YOU U. S.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:12.275 region:rollup2
DESCRIBING RATHER THAN CREATING

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:15.178 region:rollup2
NEW POOL.

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:15.745 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:16.112 region:rollup2
I THINK I MEAN THE BUILDING

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:17.980 region:rollup2
CODE.

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:20.116 region:rollup2
PROCESS HAS HAS.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.285 region:rollup2
GIVEN CALIFORNIA A LOT.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:24.087 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT'S A IT IS LEFT UP

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.855 region:rollup2
UNTIL NOW WITH THE ENGINEERS THE

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:27.356 region:rollup2
DECISION ABOUT WHAT ARE WE

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.424 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.859 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:32.028 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:34.597 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POLICY ISSUE OF WHAT

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:35.498 region:rollup2
TO AS A SOCIETY DO WE WANT. AND

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.999 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S A TECHNICAL

01:10:35.498 --> 01:10:38.634 region:rollup2
DECISION ABOUT HOW DO YOU

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:41.938 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:43.973 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS A PROCESS TO SAY.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:46.743 region:rollup2
THE. PROCESS HAS WORKED TO GIVE

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:47.310 region:rollup2
US LIFE SAFETY BUT IT'S TIME TO

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:50.780 region:rollup2
LOOK AT SOMETHING MORE THAN

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:53.149 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:54.217 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:55.785 region:rollup2

YOU AND I HAVE WORKED ON A

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:00.356 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF EARTHQUAKE SAFETY

01:10:59.055 --> 01:11:02.592 region:rollup2
MEASURES OVER THE YEARS.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:04.393 region:rollup2
I WAS EARLY CO AUTHOR OF THIS

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.561 region:rollup2

BUT HOW WE RECOVER HOW WE ARE

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.296 region:rollup2

AS COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:16.866 region:rollup2

DEVASTATED BY RECENT FIRES AND

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:26.409 region:rollup2
MUD SLIDES. TO KNOW THAT IF WE

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:30.780 region:rollup2
IT'LL COST US BILLIONS UPON

01:24:13.248 --> 01:24:14.983 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE TROUBLE WITH CYPRESS

01:24:14.683 --> 01:24:17.352 region:rollup2
HILL THAT.

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:17.519 region:rollup2
BEING DONE ON THE WITH REGARD

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:20.455 region:rollup2
TO.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:22.357 region:rollup2
THAT FIREFIGHTERS COMMENTS TO

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:23.158 region:rollup2
HAVE DATA TO LOOK AT THE ANY

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:25.460 region:rollup2
THIS TWO POINT ONE IS WHAT DO WE

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:26.628 region:rollup2
COULDN'T WE CONCEIVABLY. PROJECT

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.196 region:rollup2
FOR PARTICIPATION A PROGRAM LIKE

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:31.133 region:rollup2
THIS AND OF COURSE WHAT IS THAT

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:35.103 region:rollup2
MEAN FINANCIALLY FOR THE STATE

01:24:31.133 --> 01:24:36.705 region:rollup2
IS ANNIE CAN DO IS THAT I ADDED

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:38.240 region:rollup2
SEEKING THE BACKUP MAYBE THAT'S

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:42.544 region:rollup2
NOT THERE YET AND I REALIZE

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.211 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING SO

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:43.812 region:rollup2
MAYBE HARD TO.

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:44.513 region:rollup2
TO SAY SPECIFICALLY AT THIS

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.147 region:rollup2
POINT BUT ANY PROJECTIONS

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:46.815 region:rollup2
ANYTHING YOU CAN SHARE IN TERMS

01:24:45.147 --> 01:24:48.050 region:rollup2
OF NUMBERS BALLPARK FIGURES.

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:49.451 region:rollup2
I THINK YEAH I THINK THAT THE

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.285 region:rollup2
CHAIR I HAD DONE SOME ANALYSIS

01:24:49.451 --> 01:24:52.087 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE CAN SHARE THAT ARE

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.588 region:rollup2
ON THE TERMS OF THE COST I'M

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.322 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WHEN WINTERS.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.122 region:rollup2
.

01:24:53.322 --> 01:24:55.524 region:rollup2
A TAX ADVANTAGED AYE

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:56.558 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZING FOR FOR SAVING FOR

01:24:55.524 --> 01:24:57.159 region:rollup2
A HOME THAT WE THINK THAT WILL

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:57.759 region:rollup2
CHANGE BEHAVIORAL IT WE DON'T

01:24:57.159 --> 01:24:59.127 region:rollup2
HAVE A. STUDY WE CAN SHOW YOU

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:02.030 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD THINK

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:02.664 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT DOM

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.266 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO PARTICIPATE DEFLECTED

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:06.201 region:rollup2
IT WITH. THE FIVE TWENTY NINE

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:07.135 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN BUT. WE CAN

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:07.769 region:rollup2
WORK OUT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC YOU

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:09.171 region:rollup2
MISTER GLORIA GET THAT BACK TO

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:11.473 region:rollup2
YOU ITEMS THE COST I THINK IT'S

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:12.040 region:rollup2
IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IT

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:12.240 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE PRIOR PROPOSALS

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:13.976 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.010 region:rollup2
IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OR MORE

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:16.511 region:rollup2
SO SO WE'VE REALLY REDUCE THE

01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:20.415 region:rollup2
AMOUNT A AND THE COST OF THIS

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:20.415 region:rollup2
BILL THAT WAS STRATEGIC I'M ON

01:25:20.482 --> 01:25:22.484 region:rollup2
AND I'M MISTER CHIU MIGHT

01:25:21.917 --> 01:25:23.218 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:24.419 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL.

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.421 region:rollup2
AND SO ACCORDING TO THE

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:28.423 region:rollup2
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE COST OF

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:29.091 region:rollup2
THE BILL IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:31.026 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:25:29.091 --> 01:25:32.427 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:34.196 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTION IS EIGHT MILLION

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:35.197 region:rollup2
DOLLARS I WILL GIVE MISTER

01:25:34.196 --> 01:25:36.765 region:rollup2
STANDARD CREDIT BECAUSE HIS

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:37.399 region:rollup2
INITIAL PROPOSALS WERE IN THE

01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:39.301 region:rollup2
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:42.304 region:rollup2
THIS. THING DOES MAKE IT GO DOWN

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:44.272 region:rollup2
A BIT EASIER.

01:25:42.304 --> 01:25:45.540 region:rollup2
WHAT LEVEL OF THIS IT'S MORE

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.708 region:rollup2
THAT ANNOUNCES I'M?

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.576 region:rollup2
AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.076 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE BUYING INTO NO PUN

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.511 region:rollup2
INTENDED.

01:25:48.076 --> 01:25:51.780 region:rollup2
BUT IT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:53.582 region:rollup2
SUPPORT AND AND I RECOGNIZE IT'S

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.083 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY HARD FOR FOLKS TO BE

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:55.851 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SAY FOR THIS IS CRIED

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:57.052 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE. AND

01:25:55.851 --> 01:25:58.353 region:rollup2
STOMACH MAKE IT COMMENTS ABOUT

01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:59.254 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.689 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE SECURITY

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:01.923 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDES. YAPPING AT SOME

01:26:00.689 --> 01:26:03.158 region:rollup2
LEVEL THERE SOME TURNOVER AND

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:04.993 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME OF REASSESSMENT

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:06.695 region:rollup2
SEMI GENERATED SOME REVENUE FOR

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.096 region:rollup2
THE STATE. NONE OF THAT'S A PART

01:26:06.695 --> 01:26:09.631 region:rollup2
OF THE ANALYSIS OR NOT BUT.

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:10.832 region:rollup2
INTERESTED TO LEARN ARE MORE

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:12.701 region:rollup2
INCLINED TO SEE THIS BIPARTISAN

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:13.268 region:rollup2
COOPERATION OUT FULLY SUPPORT OF

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:15.037 region:rollup2
THE BILL. MISTER SHARP IT'S

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:16.505 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:26:15.037 --> 01:26:17.339 region:rollup2
OF ASSUMING GLORIA OF THE

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:18.507 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.508 region:rollup2
REALTORS WHAT WEEK WE CAN'T HELP

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.642 region:rollup2
BUT OFFICE OF THE PROJECTIONS

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.144 region:rollup2
THE COST OF THE STATE OF

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.811 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AMONG GO BACK TO OUR

01:26:22.144 --> 01:26:23.879 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:25.414 region:rollup2
AND SEE WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS

01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:27.182 region:rollup2
THEY CAN COME UP WITH FOR THE

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:28.216 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO USE OF THE DOWN

01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:29.851 region:rollup2
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITY

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:31.219 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE SPELL. OF I DON'T

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.853 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE THAT

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:35.157 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL DO IT WE CAN FIGURE

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:35.957 region:rollup2
OUT THE. THE SORT OF RANGE OF OF

01:26:35.157 --> 01:26:37.693 region:rollup2
INCOME AND LIKELY HAD THAT COULD

01:26:35.957 --> 01:26:39.494 region:rollup2
BE USED BUT I THINK THAT'S

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:41.763 region:rollup2
HELPFUL MORE DATA IS ALWAYS GOOD

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:43.565 region:rollup2
AND TRYING AGAIN BE RESPONSIVE

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:44.099 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS OF THE FIREFIGHTERS

01:26:43.565 --> 01:26:45.867 region:rollup2
WHICH TYPICALLY YOU KNOW I

01:26:44.099 --> 01:26:50.706 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:51.273 region:rollup2
TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU KNOW A

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:51.540 region:rollup2
SERVER VERSION OF GOVERNMENT

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:51.740 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.741 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.208 region:rollup2
WE PAY FOR ONE WAY THE OTHER

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:54.476 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.077 region:rollup2
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MAY BE

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:56.178 region:rollup2
A MODEST SUBSCRIPTION TO THIS

01:26:55.077 --> 01:26:58.180 region:rollup2
WITH RELATIVELY MODEST OVERALL

01:26:56.178 --> 01:26:59.281 region:rollup2
COSTS. AND IF THAT'S TRUE THEN

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.148 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S HOW HELPFUL FOR

01:26:59.281 --> 01:27:01.850 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO KNOW IF SOME

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:02.484 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WE ALSO KNOW THAT FOR

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:04.553 region:rollup2
A VOTE RIGHT.

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:06.455 region:rollup2
BUT AT FOR TODAY I'M HAPPY TO

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.822 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE BILL WAS DOING THAT

01:27:06.455 --> 01:27:08.323 region:rollup2
YOU THINK YOU.

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.824 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.424 region:rollup2
UP A FEW COMMENTS RIGHT

01:27:08.824 --> 01:27:11.026 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND I SHARE THIS

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:11.660 region:rollup2
WITH THE TWO AUTHORS ON THEIR

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:12.194 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY INDIVIDUAL BILLS BUT

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.361 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST MENTION TO THE

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:14.096 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:15.597 region:rollup2
THAT I'D HAD ABOUT THIS BILL

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.898 region:rollup2
WASN'T EXACTLY ABOUT THE

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:18.166 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF THIS BILL BUT THE

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.367 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THE STATE OF

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:21.069 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDE

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:22.604 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT. TAX SUBSIDIES

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:25.040 region:rollup2
ALREADY TO HOMEOWNERS.

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:26.641 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A STUDY LAST MONTH

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.043 region:rollup2
ARE THAT SHOW THAT HOMEOWNERS IN

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:28.877 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVE

01:27:28.043 --> 01:27:30.579 region:rollup2
SICK

01:27:28.877 --> 01:27:32.013 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. MOSTLY

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:33.748 region:rollup2
FROM MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:36.852 region:rollup2
AND PROPERTY TAX.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:39.154 region:rollup2
BREAKS WHERE RENTERS RECEIVE

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:40.388 region:rollup2
ONE FIFTEENTH THAT SOME OTHER

01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:41.590 region:rollup2
WORDS RENDERS WHO MAKE UP A

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:43.058 region:rollup2
LITTLE ABOUT A LITTLE LESS THAN

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:44.326 region:rollup2
HALF THE STATE.

01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:45.861 region:rollup2
RECEIVE LITERALLY.

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:47.529 region:rollup2
BUT TO HER FIFTEEN MILLION

01:27:45.861 --> 01:27:48.997 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR MULTIPLY THAT BY

01:27:47.529 --> 01:27:51.133 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THAT'S WHAT HOMEOWNERS

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:53.034 region:rollup2
RECEIVE SO FOR ME. IN THE

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:53.902 region:rollup2
CONTEXT OF THAT DISCUSSION AN

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:56.705 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL.

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:58.707 region:rollup2
SET OF OF TAX SUBSIDIES I

01:27:56.705 --> 01:28:00.242 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY LOOK ON WITH THE

01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:02.010 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT SCRUTINY IF A REP TO

01:28:00.242 --> 01:28:03.211 region:rollup2
ME. BUT I THINK THAT WHAT MR

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:05.213 region:rollup2
STEINORTH AND WHAT MR BONTA ARE

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:06.748 region:rollup2
PROPOSING ARE MUCH BETTER

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.383 region:rollup2
TAILORED. TOWARD.

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:10.585 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF FIRST TIME HOME

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:12.788 region:rollup2
BUYERS AND I WOULD IF IT WERE UP

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.121 region:rollup2
TO ME I WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:15.357 region:rollup2
HOW TO SHIFT.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:17.292 region:rollup2
THE TAX SUBSIDY FROM WHAT IS A

01:28:15.357 --> 01:28:18.693 region:rollup2
HIGHLY REGRESSIVE MORTGAGE

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:20.162 region:rollup2
INTEREST DEDUCTION AND FOR THAT

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:21.930 region:rollup2
MATTER I THINK PROPERTY TAX.

01:28:20.162 --> 01:28:23.331 region:rollup2
A EXCLUSIONS AS WELL AND SHIFTED

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:25.033 region:rollup2
TO TO THIS BUT.

01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:26.835 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT.

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:28.503 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORS HAVE PARED DOWN THE

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:30.272 region:rollup2
TAX IMPACT OF THIS BILL.

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.839 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS WORTHY OF OUR

01:28:30.272 --> 01:28:32.507 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:33.074 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.776 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:35.944 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANNA RESPOND MISTER

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:37.279 region:rollup2
GLORIA AROUND THE THRESHOLD

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:38.914 region:rollup2
INITIALLY OUR STAFF HAD

01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:39.915 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED AN EIGHTY PERCENT AND

01:28:38.914 --> 01:28:41.416 region:rollup2
MY THRESHOLD.

01:28:39.915 --> 01:28:43.018 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE CONSISTENT

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:44.219 region:rollup2
ACROSS TO REFER PROPOSALS BUT I

01:28:43.018 --> 01:28:46.621 region:rollup2
THINK GIVEN THAT WE'VE MERGED

01:28:44.219 --> 01:28:48.523 region:rollup2
INTO ONE THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE.

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:49.558 region:rollup2
I DO AGREE THAT ARE REYES AND

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:51.059 region:rollup2
IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT I

01:28:49.558 --> 01:28:52.260 region:rollup2
AM I WILL HELP US CAPTURE MORE

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:54.963 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT ARE CHALLENGING

01:41:14.769 --> 01:41:17.572 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S FIVE LESS THAN

01:41:16.704 --> 01:41:21.475 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WILL THEIR SEVEN

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:22.643 region:rollup2
VACANCIES AMONG THE FIFTY THREE.

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:24.011 region:rollup2
SO IT AND THEN PUT ON TOP OF

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:25.780 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:26.981 region:rollup2

01:41:28.716 --> 01:41:33.821 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A FEE THAT CREATES

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:35.156 region:rollup2

OF THE GOAL. OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:20.147 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO AYE BUT.

01:45:19.213 --> 01:45:20.948 region:rollup2
I THINK THE OPPOSITION RAY

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:21.448 region:rollup2
SEVERAL.

01:45:20.948 --> 01:45:22.816 region:rollup2
VERY PERTINENT POINTS.

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.918 region:rollup2
.

01:45:22.816 --> 01:45:25.386 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF INSPECTORS MEAN TO.

01:45:23.918 --> 01:45:26.787 region:rollup2
IT IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:45:25.386 --> 01:45:29.190 region:rollup2
TO JUST.

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:31.192 region:rollup2
CREATE SOMETHING THAT HAS NO

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:31.759 region:rollup2
THAT IS GONNA OF NO PRACTICAL

01:45:31.192 --> 01:45:33.360 region:rollup2
EFFECT BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE

01:45:31.759 --> 01:45:34.628 region:rollup2
ENFORCED. IS A WASTE OF

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.196 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S TIME AND I DON'T

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:37.698 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S THE GOALS OF WHAT

01:45:35.196 --> 01:45:38.566 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING.

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:39.200 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I

01:45:38.566 --> 01:45:40.901 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT EVERYBODY ON THIS

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:42.670 region:rollup2
THIS BODY STRATEGY WHICH IS NOT

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:46.207 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE TRACK?

01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:48.042 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT THE IDEA OF A WEBSITE

01:45:46.207 --> 01:45:49.243 region:rollup2
YOU SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES

01:45:48.042 --> 01:45:49.843 region:rollup2
MINUTES FOR SEPARATE BUT TODAY

01:45:49.243 --> 01:45:51.412 region:rollup2
BY THINGS PRETTY GOOD IDEA I

01:45:49.843 --> 01:45:52.413 region:rollup2
MEAN THERE'S SOME THINGS I THINK

01:45:51.412 --> 01:45:53.747 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT COULD BE DONE THAT

01:45:52.413 --> 01:45:54.949 region:rollup2
WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL BUT IT

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:56.116 region:rollup2
WOULD STILL BE LESS BURDENSOME

01:45:54.949 --> 01:45:58.652 region:rollup2
AND AND WOULD PROBABLY LONG TERM

01:45:56.116 --> 01:46:01.255 region:rollup2
BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE SO.

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:01.889 region:rollup2
I'D I'M PLEASED THE AYE AYE

01:46:01.255 --> 01:46:02.923 region:rollup2

01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:07.428 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS.

01:46:05.793 --> 01:46:09.630 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT'S AN ISSUE

01:46:07.428 --> 01:46:10.864 region:rollup2
THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE

01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:11.999 region:rollup2
RESOLVED AND YOU KNOW IF THERE'S

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:13.734 region:rollup2
SOME FEE GOING TO PAY THESE

INSPECTORS AND THEN THERE'S NO

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:17.271 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS. AND IT BEGS THE

01:46:15.903 --> 01:46:23.410 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS TO WHERE IS THIS BE

01:46:17.271 --> 01:46:24.011 region:rollup2
GOING. UP AND I THINK THAT NEEDS

01:46:23.410 --> 01:46:27.147 region:rollup2
TO BE TRACKED DOWN AS WELL TO

01:46:24.011 --> 01:46:34.788 region:rollup2

01:53:12.653 --> 01:53:15.522 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS.

01:53:13.487 --> 01:53:16.657 region:rollup2
BUT AS MANY OF YOU CAN ATTEST

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:18.225 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALSO THE CASE THROUGHOUT

01:53:16.657 --> 01:53:20.727 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:53:18.225 --> 01:53:22.029 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:24.031 region:rollup2
BRINGING THAT FORWARD TO THE

01:53:22.029 --> 01:53:26.400 region:rollup2

TO TRY TO SOLVE OUR LACK OF

01:53:34.141 --> 01:53:37.411 region:rollup2

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:42.249 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT TO SEEK MORE

01:53:40.447 --> 01:53:45.519 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME

01:53:42.249 --> 01:53:47.821 region:rollup2

01:53:50.457 --> 01:53:54.728 region:rollup2
THE CASA ADD DOES JUST THAT BY

ALLOWING DEAL DEVELOPERS THE

01:53:54.728 --> 01:53:59.466 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW MANY

UNITS THEY CAN BUILD. RATHER

01:53:59.466 --> 01:54:03.770 region:rollup2
THAN CAP INTENSITY THROUGH OUR

OF DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE.

01:54:05.739 --> 01:54:09.242 region:rollup2
WHERE TRADITIONALLY A LOT WOULD

01:54:07.474 --> 01:54:10.877 region:rollup2
BE RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:13.113 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DWELLING UNITS PER

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:14.815 region:rollup2

FAMILY HOUSING SOUNDS TO SET A

01:54:14.815 --> 01:54:20.153 region:rollup2

REALLY MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:25.092 region:rollup2
UNITS ON SITE.

01:54:23.490 --> 01:54:27.127 region:rollup2
BUT CASA ACT

01:54:25.092 --> 01:54:29.730 region:rollup2
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE A

01:54:27.127 --> 01:54:31.698 region:rollup2

WORK ON THIS ISSUE.

01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:40.327 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:56:38.859 --> 01:56:40.961 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE OPT IN PROVISION I

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:42.395 region:rollup2
THINK IS SIGNIFICANT YOU AND I

01:56:40.961 --> 01:56:45.866 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE GOOD EXAMPLES OF

01:56:42.395 --> 01:56:46.466 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THE DEBT THE DISTRICTS

01:56:45.866 --> 01:56:46.733 region:rollup2
WE REPRESENTED WHEN WE ARE ON

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:47.367 region:rollup2
THE CITY.

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:47.801 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR DISTRICT

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:48.969 region:rollup2
HAS

01:56:47.801 --> 01:56:51.538 region:rollup2
MANY MORE TRANSIT FOR EXAMPLE

01:56:48.969 --> 01:56:53.740 region:rollup2
MANY MORE TRANSIT OPTIONS. THAN

01:56:51.538 --> 01:56:55.375 region:rollup2
WE DO I TO GET FROM IN A RANCH

01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:57.644 region:rollup2
FOR OUR SCRIPTS RANCH TO HELP

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:58.245 region:rollup2
CRAFT STORE EVEN WORSE STEP

01:56:57.644 --> 01:56:59.145 region:rollup2
POINT LOMA OUR SUMMER THERE IS

01:56:58.245 --> 01:57:01.615 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:03.483 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TRANSIT CHOICE IT IS

01:57:01.615 --> 01:57:05.952 region:rollup2
REALLY AN IMPOSSIBILITY ALMOST

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:08.221 region:rollup2
ARM AND AND AND. AS SUCH IS NOT

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:09.523 region:rollup2
UTILIZED BECAUSE TO GET THERE IS

01:57:08.221 --> 01:57:12.058 region:rollup2
A YOU KNOW TWO HOUR BUS RIDE

01:57:09.523 --> 01:57:13.526 region:rollup2
WITH FOR TRANSFERS AND SO AS A

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:16.429 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT NO ONE DOES IT.

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:18.231 region:rollup2
SO I THINK HAVING THAT OPT IN.

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:20.433 region:rollup2
AT UPTON IS VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:23.036 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS THESE REGIONS HAVE

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:24.337 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT NEEDS AYE

01:57:23.036 --> 01:57:25.705 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT ABILITIES TO DO

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:27.474 region:rollup2
THIS A AND M. IS COMES TO I

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:28.375 region:rollup2
THINK YOU HAVE SOME AN HOUR I

01:57:27.474 --> 01:57:30.543 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THE EXACT PERSON

01:57:28.375 --> 01:57:32.078 region:rollup2
BETWEEN HIM SQUARE BUT YOU HAVE

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:32.746 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:33.980 region:rollup2
THE POLICEMAN BETTER TRANSIT OP

01:57:32.746 --> 01:57:35.415 region:rollup2
OPTIONS BUT SOME PROBLEM MORE

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:36.483 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT HOUSING OPTIONS

01:57:35.415 --> 01:57:37.851 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS SORT OF

01:57:36.483 --> 01:57:40.587 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES THAT.

01:57:37.851 --> 01:57:42.055 region:rollup2
THAT BALANCE VERY VERY WELL.

01:57:40.587 --> 01:57:43.823 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S A UNIQUE

01:57:42.055 --> 01:57:46.192 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO TRY TO GET OUT ACT

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:47.494 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO GET A PROBLEM OF HOW

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:49.863 region:rollup2
TO INCREASE HOUSING STOCK BUT

01:57:47.494 --> 01:57:51.464 region:rollup2
HAD WE DO SO IN A WAY. THAT

01:57:49.863 --> 01:57:52.766 region:rollup2
DOESN'T TRAP PEOPLE.

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:55.335 region:rollup2
IN A SITUATION THAT WOULD BE

01:57:52.766 --> 01:57:58.305 region:rollup2
UNSUSTAINABLE BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:57:55.335 --> 01:57:58.905 region:rollup2
HOW THEY DEAL WITH EMPLOYMENT

01:57:58.305 --> 01:57:59.906 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HOW TO DEAL WITH YOU

01:57:58.905 --> 01:58:01.574 region:rollup2

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:02.509 region:rollup2

THE BILL WOULD MAKE COUNTIES AND

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:03.650 region:rollup2
SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOLE THROUGH

02:02:01.848 --> 02:02:04.984 region:rollup2
PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS AND THE

02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:06.619 region:rollup2

02:02:23.303 --> 02:02:26.239 region:rollup2
THIS BILL INCLUDES A CAP ON HOW

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:27.674 region:rollup2
MUCH THE STATE WOULD CONTRIBUTE

02:02:26.239 --> 02:02:30.376 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S

02:02:27.674 --> 02:02:31.644 region:rollup2
A CONTROL ON THE SIZE OF THIS

NEW VERSION OF REDEVELOPMENT.

02:02:31.644 --> 02:02:34.881 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT WILL GROW TO THE

02:02:32.779 --> 02:02:37.317 region:rollup2
SCALE OF FORMER REDEVELOPMENT

02:02:34.881 --> 02:02:37.917 region:rollup2
THAT AMOUNT IS CURRENTLY BLANK

02:02:37.317 --> 02:02:38.551 region:rollup2
AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:40.920 region:rollup2
RIGHT AMOUNT.

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:42.021 region:rollup2
TO AVOID EGREGIOUS ABUSES THAT

SOME FORMER REDEVELOPMENT

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.958 region:rollup2

02:15:32.391 --> 02:15:33.692 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

02:15:32.992 --> 02:15:34.893 region:rollup2
RAISED BY SOME OF THE

02:15:33.692 --> 02:15:35.461 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE WORKED HARD

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:37.930 region:rollup2
IN RECENT MONTHS TO ADDRESS

02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:40.199 region:rollup2
CONCERNS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:42.134 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION WE ARE REQUIRED TO

02:15:40.199 --> 02:15:43.202 region:rollup2
INCLUDE ALL TAX ALL TAXING

02:15:42.134 --> 02:15:44.036 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE PROPERTY

02:15:43.202 --> 02:15:45.337 region:rollup2
TAXES

02:15:44.036 --> 02:15:47.339 region:rollup2
SO THAT INCLUDES CITIES COUNTIES

02:15:45.337 --> 02:15:49.441 region:rollup2
AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS.

02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:51.877 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE BUT ARE BILL IS

02:15:49.441 --> 02:15:53.612 region:rollup2
DRAFTED TO MAKE COUNTIES AND

02:15:51.877 --> 02:15:54.680 region:rollup2
SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOLE THROUGH

02:15:53.612 --> 02:15:55.781 region:rollup2
PASSED THROUGH PAYMENTS AND I

02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:57.282 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME ISSUES

02:15:55.781 --> 02:15:59.618 region:rollup2
AROUND. EXACTLY HOW THAT'S

02:15:57.282 --> 02:16:00.619 region:rollup2
DRAFTED AND A I AM COMMITTED TO

MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:03.288 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS AND

02:16:01.487 --> 02:16:05.224 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD. TO HOPEFULLY DOING

02:16:03.288 --> 02:16:06.959 region:rollup2
THAT IN SHORT ORDER AND THEN.

02:16:05.224 --> 02:16:08.961 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED FOR THE FUNDS

02:16:06.959 --> 02:16:09.895 region:rollup2
THAT WERE DIVERTED FROM SCHOOLS

02:16:08.961 --> 02:16:11.163 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BACK FILLED UNDER PROP

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:12.731 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT SO THIS IS REALLY

02:16:11.163 --> 02:16:13.632 region:rollup2

HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE

02:16:19.505 --> 02:16:22.274 region:rollup2

AS WELL AS CRITICAL

02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:27.446 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF THAT WE

IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR CITIES IN

02:16:42.561 --> 02:16:45.864 region:rollup2
THE LAST MAJOR AFFORDABLE

02:16:44.630 --> 02:16:47.666 region:rollup2
HOUSING PROJECT WAS BUILT.

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:49.501 region:rollup2
ONLY THROUGH REDEVELOPMENT AND

02:16:47.666 --> 02:16:50.102 region:rollup2
AS A ABSOLUTE CRITICAL TOOL FOR

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.303 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

02:16:50.102 --> 02:16:52.371 region:rollup2

CONVERSATION I ACTUALLY WAS PART

02:18:31.370 --> 02:18:34.473 region:rollup2
OF OF THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY THAT

02:18:32.871 --> 02:18:35.908 region:rollup2
HAD REAL CONCERNS WITH

02:18:34.473 --> 02:18:37.276 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT. AND NOT BECAUSE

02:18:35.908 --> 02:18:39.745 region:rollup2
IT DID HAVE MERITS BUT BECAUSE

02:18:37.276 --> 02:18:41.580 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD SEE EXAMPLES OF.

02:18:39.745 --> 02:18:43.615 region:rollup2
ISSUES WHERE IT'S JUST IT WAS

02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:45.017 region:rollup2
TAKEN AWAY FROM. YOU KNOW ONE

02:18:43.615 --> 02:18:46.518 region:rollup2
POT TO GO INTO SOMETHING THAT

02:18:45.017 --> 02:18:48.086 region:rollup2
JUST DIDN'T SETTLE WELL I THINK

02:18:46.518 --> 02:18:49.488 region:rollup2
IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT.

02:18:48.086 --> 02:18:50.856 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION

02:18:49.488 --> 02:18:52.891 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALSO THE EDUCATION

02:18:50.856 --> 02:18:53.859 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT IS LOOKING FOR

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.793 region:rollup2
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES IN

02:18:53.859 --> 02:18:55.594 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FOR FOR THE

02:18:54.793 --> 02:18:58.096 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT.

02:18:55.594 --> 02:18:59.631 region:rollup2
SO I'M GLAD THAT IT'S COMING TO

02:18:58.096 --> 02:19:01.133 region:rollup2
S. IN A NINETY YEAR CONCEPT

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:03.235 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY FOCUS THAT MUCH MORE

02:19:01.133 --> 02:19:04.570 region:rollup2
NARROW. AND SO THAT IT CAN ALLOW

02:19:03.235 --> 02:19:05.404 region:rollup2
SOME OF US HAVE WHO HAVE HAD

02:19:04.570 --> 02:19:08.006 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:19:05.404 --> 02:19:08.874 region:rollup2
WITH THE USE OF SOME OF THIS IN

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.409 region:rollup2
THE PAST

02:19:08.874 --> 02:19:11.310 region:rollup2
TO REALLY HAVE COME ON BOARD SO

02:19:10.409 --> 02:19:12.744 region:rollup2
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:19:11.310 --> 02:19:13.845 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL HAPPEN.

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:15.247 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THE EDUCATION

02:19:13.845 --> 02:19:16.648 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WILL BE INVOLVED BUT I

02:19:15.247 --> 02:19:18.050 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:19.518 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:21.353 region:rollup2
LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ALL AROUND

02:19:19.518 --> 02:19:23.288 region:rollup2
AND IT'S A MISSING PIECE. OF

02:19:21.353 --> 02:19:23.889 region:rollup2
WHERE RAT NOW AND PART OF THIS

02:19:23.288 --> 02:19:25.057 region:rollup2
LARGER EQUATION OF HOW WE GET

02:19:23.889 --> 02:19:26.592 region:rollup2
TO.

02:19:25.057 --> 02:19:28.727 region:rollup2
SOLVE SOME OF OUR HOUSING

02:19:26.592 --> 02:19:32.731 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS.

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:34.867 region:rollup2

THANK YOU CHAIR I. WOULD LIKE TO

02:19:34.867 --> 02:19:37.536 region:rollup2
ASK.

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:41.240 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE MAJOR.

02:19:37.536 --> 02:19:42.774 region:rollup2
.

02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:45.244 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC GUY ISSUE IS.

02:19:42.774 --> 02:19:47.179 region:rollup2
.

02:19:45.244 --> 02:19:51.350 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE

02:19:47.179 --> 02:19:52.484 region:rollup2
pNOT CREATE THAT WE DEVELOP ONE

02:19:51.350 --> 02:19:54.686 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:57.055 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

02:19:54.686 --> 02:19:58.590 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THOSE VOTER APPROVAL.

02:19:57.055 --> 02:20:00.659 region:rollup2
CAN YOU ELIMINATE THAT THAT THE

02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:03.495 region:rollup2
LEFT ON LOCAL PEOPLE OR TWO.

02:20:00.659 --> 02:20:05.197 region:rollup2
DECIDE THIS IS SOME MAJOR

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:09.835 region:rollup2
ISSUES SO.

02:20:05.197 --> 02:20:12.604 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLY AREA THAT DOES.

02:20:09.835 --> 02:20:13.972 region:rollup2
IN ROME.

02:20:12.604 --> 02:20:15.474 region:rollup2
DONNA LET THE LOCAL LAWS

02:20:13.972 --> 02:20:18.710 region:rollup2
CITIZENS TO GET INVOLVED. IF

02:20:15.474 --> 02:20:20.712 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:22.314 region:rollup2
IF THAT THAT IS SO GREEDY OF

02:20:20.712 --> 02:20:23.215 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO SUIT THAT DUNLOP

02:20:22.314 --> 02:20:24.750 region:rollup2
BELIEVES.

02:20:23.215 --> 02:20:26.351 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW IT WAS STRUCTURED

02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:27.786 region:rollup2
UNDER A THAT HAS THAT UNDER THE

02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:28.353 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION THAT IS HOW IT'S

02:20:27.786 --> 02:20:30.122 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED.

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:32.257 region:rollup2
HOW REDEVELOPMENT?

02:20:30.122 --> 02:20:33.425 region:rollup2
WAS FORMED FOR AGAIN WHAT WE'RE

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:35.761 region:rollup2
DOING HERE IS WE ARE LIMITING

02:20:33.425 --> 02:20:37.562 region:rollup2
WHAT THE USES COULD BE. WITH

02:20:35.761 --> 02:20:39.298 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT FROM THE

02:20:37.562 --> 02:20:41.233 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WITH SIGNIFICANT

02:20:39.298 --> 02:20:42.601 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARDS AND GUARD RAILS ARE

02:20:41.233 --> 02:20:43.235 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS FOCUSED

02:20:42.601 --> 02:20:45.370 region:rollup2
ON.

02:20:43.235 --> 02:20:46.305 region:rollup2
ON ON CRITICAL HOUSING AND

02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:48.340 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WITH ALL OF

02:20:46.305 --> 02:20:49.508 region:rollup2
THE LEVELS OF PURPLE APPROVALS

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:51.109 region:rollup2
THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE.

02:20:49.508 --> 02:20:52.077 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUICK ANSWER QUESTIONS

02:20:51.109 --> 02:20:54.713 region:rollup2
THAT IS HOW IT'S STRUCTURED

02:20:52.077 --> 02:20:56.748 region:rollup2
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE

02:20:54.713 --> 02:20:57.649 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION.

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:59.017 region:rollup2
SO IT UNDER THE STATE

02:20:57.649 --> 02:21:00.385 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTION ALLOWS

02:23:04.376 --> 02:23:07.412 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING

02:23:05.911 --> 02:23:08.380 region:rollup2
INTERESTINGLY NOW THAT WE HAVE

02:23:07.412 --> 02:23:09.448 region:rollup2
THE BALLPARK AND ALL THAT

02:23:08.380 --> 02:23:09.614 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY OF COURSE A SPORT OF

02:23:09.448 --> 02:23:11.283 region:rollup2

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:12.751 region:rollup2
.

02:23:11.283 --> 02:23:14.119 region:rollup2

02:23:17.756 --> 02:23:20.826 region:rollup2
THAT MAY GO AWAY FROM AYE AYE

02:23:20.358 --> 02:23:23.395 region:rollup2
INTO WHETHER IT'S LAW

SOME OF THE OTHER PUBLIC

SERVICE I THINK THAT CHYNA NEEDS

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:27.866 region:rollup2
TO BE ADDRESSED BUT

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:29.468 region:rollup2

BUT THOSE SHOULD OF BEEN

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:44.950 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED NOW IT'S TRYING TO

02:23:43.482 --> 02:23:46.585 region:rollup2
FIND A SOLUTION.

FROM OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE

02:24:17.782 --> 02:24:20.018 region:rollup2
AISLE THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES

02:24:18.717 --> 02:24:21.419 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A

02:24:20.018 --> 02:24:22.988 region:rollup2
LACK OF VOTER APPROVAL. WERE NOT

02:24:21.419 --> 02:24:25.157 region:rollup2
INCREASING.

02:24:22.988 --> 02:24:26.725 region:rollup2
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:24:25.157 --> 02:24:28.226 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO

02:24:26.725 --> 02:24:29.895 region:rollup2
YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE

IN AND WHERE THEY SHOULD BE USED

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:38.937 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY SHOULD BE

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:41.173 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZED.

02:24:38.937 --> 02:24:42.707 region:rollup2
I THINK GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS

02:24:41.173 --> 02:24:44.543 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE GIVEN THE

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:46.011 region:rollup2

THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN

02:24:46.011 --> 02:24:49.514 region:rollup2
DIEGO THE ENCAMPMENTS THAT WERE

02:24:47.679 --> 02:24:50.782 region:rollup2

CHALLENGES THAT WERE SEEN AND.

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:53.685 region:rollup2
AS THE MONTHS DISTRICT AND

02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:55.587 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHICH DISTRICT GIVEN THE

02:24:53.685 --> 02:24:56.688 region:rollup2
FIRES AND MUD SLIDES WHAT WE'RE

02:24:55.587 --> 02:24:58.290 region:rollup2
SEEING IN CITIES LIKE MINE AND

02:24:56.688 --> 02:25:01.393 region:rollup2
AND AND EVERY CITY IN THE IN THE

02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:03.194 region:rollup2
STATE. OF THIS CRISIS WAS CAUSED

02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:04.262 region:rollup2
IN PART BECAUSE OF THE

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:06.164 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPED THAT THE ELIMINATION

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:06.665 region:rollup2
OF REDEVELOPMENT AND THE LOSS OF

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:07.699 region:rollup2
A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

FUNDING.

02:25:07.699 --> 02:25:10.669 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:25:09.267 --> 02:25:12.370 region:rollup2
IS TO TO BRING THAT BACK.

02:25:10.669 --> 02:25:14.406 region:rollup2
BUT DO IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:16.908 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF OF CONTROL AND AND

02:25:14.406 --> 02:25:19.110 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT ARE AS WELL AS WITH

02:25:16.908 --> 02:25:21.479 region:rollup2
WITH BY AND FROM LOCALITIES. IN

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:22.981 region:rollup2
A WAY THAT THAT HOLDS A HARMLESS

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:24.649 region:rollup2
A AND INSURES THAT SPECIAL

02:25:22.981 --> 02:25:26.885 region:rollup2
