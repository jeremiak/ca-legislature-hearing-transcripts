REJECT THE PROPOSAL. ON THE

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:10.208

INCREASE IN OUR NEW BUSINESSES

NEW BUSINESS- IN CALIFORNIA THE-

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.529
THE SMALL SIZE OF THE P. REALLY

00:20:30.596 --> 00:20:32.164
IT WOULD NOT BE THE THING THAT

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:33.832
PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM- THE

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.468
OPENING OF A BUSINESS STATE. AND

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:37.736
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.648
AS FAR AS WHICH- FEES ARE BEING

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:52.784
WAIVED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR- AND

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.219
THE LAST PIECE THAT WE RECOMMEND

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.321
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. DIRECT

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:58.190
ADMINISTRATION TO REVIEW THE

00:20:58.256 --> 00:21:05.197
FUND ITSELF BECAUSE- IT. WE THAT

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:07.299

THE BUSINESS CONNECT- SYSTEM IS

IN ITS LAST MODULE HI AND- IT

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.379
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE. THE

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.780
SECRETARY STATES OPERATIONS AND

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.048
BECAUSE OF THAT THEY MIGHT NOT

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.317
KNOW WHAT THE APPROPRIATE FEW

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:29.154
LEVEL OR- RESERVE LEVELS ARE FOR

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:31.223
AT LEAST A COUPLE OF YEARS SO WE

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:32.591
THINK. THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:33.925
EVENTUALLY SHOULD DIRECT- THE

00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:37.629
MINISTRATION REPORT ON WHAT THE

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:38.296
- ROBERT IF YOU STRUCK SHOULD BE

00:21:38.363 --> 00:21:41.233
AS WELL AS RESERVE WOMAN. OKAY

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:44.302
THANK YOU WE WILL NOW OPEN IT UP

FOR DISCUSSION AND QUESTIONS

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:48.907
FROM OUR- COMMITTEE I SEE

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.051
YOU VENTURE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.920
THE COMMON IN THE AGENDA OF THE

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.922
TALKS ABOUT. AND SUGGESTED

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:04.990
BUSINESS IS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:06.692
PAYING HIGHER FEES AND NECESSARY

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:08.660
TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. GIVEN

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.228
THE TRANSFERS TO THE GENERAL

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:12.798
FUND IN THE- ASSISTANCE THIS IS

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:15.167
TIED TO THE RESERVE LIMIT OF ONE

00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:17.402
MILLION DOLLARS I GUESS WHY NOT

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.471
INCREASE THE RESERVE LIMIT AND

00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:24.376
REDUCE. THE BUSINESS FEES

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.611
CHARGED TO BUSINESSES AT THIS

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.780
POINT IN TIME AND THEN ADJUST AS

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.749
NECESSARY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:32.484
WE MOVE TO THROUGH THIS

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:33.852
PARTICULAR MODULE TO WHATEVER

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:42.561
FOLLOWS. ANY TAKERS. SURE I CAN

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.697
AGO FIRSTHAND DON'T. I THINK ONE

00:22:45.764 --> 00:22:48.433
OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.002
UNDERSTAND SHOOT THIS FUND IS

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:52.537
SUPPOSED TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.873
AND SO YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL IN

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.675
ESTABLISHING THE FUNDS THE

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:59.377
STRUCTURE AND- THE RESERVE

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:01.379
LIMITS TO ENSURE THEY CAN'T

00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:03.115
REMAIN TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT I

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:04.950
THINK THAT CONSIDERING THE

00:23:05.016 --> 00:23:06.017
BUSINESS CONNECTION IS GOING TO

00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:07.385
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE HOW THE

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:09.588
DIVISION OPERATES. IT MIGHT

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:10.989
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE WHAT

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.492
RESOURCES SECTOR STATE NEEDS-

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.227
AND WHAT FEW LEVELS MIGHT BE

00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:17.062
REQUIRED AND SO THAT IS WHY WE

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:19.231
RECOMMEND THAT IT BE A DECISION

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:21.533
IS MADE LATER THAT BEING SAID IF

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.601
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:23.602
ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT THEY

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:26.138
CAN DEVELOP SOONER THAN THAT- IT

00:23:26.204 --> 00:23:28.273
DID IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD IDEA.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.241
BUT THAT'S WEIRD WE DEAL WITH

00:23:29.307 --> 00:23:30.842
SPECIAL FUNDS AND SPECIAL FUND

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:33.578
INSOLVENCY ALL THE TIME IN OUR

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:35.714
BUDGET WOULD THIS NOT BE DEALT

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.972
PRACTICE- HOWEVER THIS APPROACH

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.707
DISCONNECTS ME ON THE HEALTH OF

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.175
THE FIND AND RESOLVING

00:34:04.242 --> 00:34:05.510

EXPENDITURES FROM THE FINDS OUT

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:19.824
WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING

PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO MAKE

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.227

IN THE RESPECTIVE FINDS. I'M

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.565

SONG OF SOLVENCY AND PROPOSED

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:38.736
FEE INCREASES WHICH ARE NOT.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:41.405
EASY SUBJECTS TO DEAL WITH AND

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.874
IT'S- IN LARGE PART BECAUSE

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.644
WE'VE- I HAVE CREATED OUR OWN

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:47.645
PROBLEM IN THE CONSUMER

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.780
PROTECTION CONSUMER AFFAIRS AREA

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:52.283
WE- DECIDE FOR PURPOSES OF

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.385
CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT WE NEED

00:35:54.452 --> 00:35:56.254
TO SET UP AN ARCHITECTURE. WHERE

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.189
WE ESTABLISH BOARDS AND BUREAUS

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:00.925
AND WE'VE DONE THAT FOR ABOUT

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.059
THIRTY FIVE OR THIRTY SIX OF

00:36:02.126 --> 00:36:04.695
THEM AS I RECALL. AND WE SET UP

00:36:04.762 --> 00:36:06.397
A PROCESS BY WHICH WE LICENSE

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:07.798
PEOPLE. REQUIRE THAT THEY HAVE

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:09.133
CERTAIN SKILLS AND EDUCATION AND

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.235
TRAINING BUT ONCE AGAIN FOR

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:13.771
CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND TO FIND

00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:16.173
THIS A SYSTEM THAT WE SET UP

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.608
ACROSS THESE VARIOUS BOARDS AND

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:19.644
BUREAUS WHICH ARE STAFFED BY.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.479
STATE EMPLOYEES THE STATE WAGE

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.648
AND BENEFIT SCHEDULE AND ALL THE

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:25.449
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:26.984
WITH GOVERNMENT WHICH ALL

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:29.587
CARRIES A PRICE TAG. WE SET

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:32.657
LICENSE FEES. AND IN PART THOSE

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:33.958
LICENSE FEES PAID BY THOSE

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:37.261
LICENSEES OR TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.129
ENFORCEMENT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:39.997
PEOPLE ARE LICENSED IN THOSE TO

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:41.799
DONATE HERE. TO THE STANDARDS OF

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.734
CONDUCT OR THE STANDARDS OF

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:46.304
PRACTICE OR ARE DISCIPLINED AND

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.273
LICENSES ARE ADJUSTED. BUT THEN

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.442
AS GOVERNMENT TYPICALLY DOES AND

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:52.743
I'M NOT A CRITIC OF GOVERNMENT

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.479
BUT GOVERNMENT HAS A COST WE HAD

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:58.082
SYSTEMS AND PROCESS. WE APPROVE

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:01.752
MO USE. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:02.286
COMPUTER SYSTEMS WHICH GET

00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:05.323
EXPENSIVE. AND THEN BECAUSE THIS

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:06.624
DCA BOARD IN BUREAU PROCESS

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:08.426
WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:09.827
CENTRAL VALLEY KNOWS MUCH BETTER

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:14.265
THAN I DO TO HER PRAYER LIFE-

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:16.367
CARRIES A COST AND IT'S THIS IS

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.035
FUNDED SOLELY BY THE LICENSEES

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:20.371
WE THEN TURN AROUND AND WE ARE

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:22.540
FORCED TO INCREASE LICENSE FEES

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:23.140
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:25.876
ABOUT HERE FUND INSOLVENCY

00:37:25.943 --> 00:37:27.778
BECAUSE BY AND I. T. PROJECT AND

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:30.414
OTHER THINGS. THAT THEN RESULT

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.350
IN A PRESSURE TO INCREASE THE

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:36.354
LICENSE FEES PAID BY LICENSEES.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.255
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.257
COMPLETELY BIZARRE AND

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:43.828
UNWORKABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE.

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.396
SYSTEM AND I KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE

00:37:45.463 --> 00:37:47.231
TO DISCUSS THAT TODAY EXCEPT IT

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.400
IS PART OF THIS AND I'M JUST

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:50.501
TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION AT

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.536
THIS POINT AT SOME POINT WE'RE

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.305
GOING TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.207
TABLE. AND DECIDE WHAT AMOUNT OF

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.642
MONEY LICENSE THE LICENSEE

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.076
SHOULD PAY THROUGH THEIR LICENSE

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:01.212
FEES AND WHAT IT SHOULD BE USED

00:38:01.278 --> 00:38:02.713
FOR AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.148
OTHER PARTS OF THIS THAT ARE

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.850
PART OF STATE GOVERNMENT THAT

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.852
ARE UNRELATED UNRELATED TO WHAT

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:09.420
THE LICENSEES ARE DOING WITH

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:12.289
THEIR LICENSES. THAT OUGHT TO BE

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.691
FUNDED APPROPRIATELY BY THE

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:16.527
GENERAL FUND. SO I'VE NOW GIVEN

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.229
MY LECTURE FOR THE DAY AND I

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:20.064
WILL STOP TALKING BUT I WOULD

00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.365

00:53:49.859 --> 00:53:51.795
SHIFT THE FUNDING FROM COST

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.830
RECOVERY TO GENERAL FUND FOR

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:55.632
APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE

00:53:55.699 --> 00:53:57.100
POSITIONS THE OTHER THREE

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:59.069
MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT MAKE UP

00:53:59.135 --> 00:54:00.637
THE FORTY FOUR MILLION I WOULD

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.439
BE A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION

00:54:02.505 --> 00:54:05.709
FOR- A STATEWIDE REPORTING

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:08.278
CONSULTING CONTRACT DOLLARS THAT

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.580
WE ARE HERE TO FOR. SOARED

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:16.686
WITHIN. YES OUR AFTER A FORTY-

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:18.855
AS I SAY THIS YEAH WOULD ALLOW

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:22.058
US TO BASICALLY TAKE SOME TWO

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:23.593
HUNDRED FIVE POSITIONS ABOUT A

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.729
FIFTH OF HIS OVERALL POSITIONS

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:28.298
MOVING FROM COST RECOVERY TO THE

00:54:28.365 --> 00:54:29.866
GENERAL FUND SO WE'RE NO LONGER

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.468
COST RECOVER FROM THEM THAT

00:54:31.534 --> 00:54:32.669
WOULD INCLUDE ALL OF THE

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:34.904
EXISTING OVERHEAD POSITIONS THAT

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:37.140
ARE STE IN T. S. R. F. AS WELL

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.708
AS SOME OF THE INDIRECT

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:42.145
POSITIONS AS WELL- CDT LOOKS AT

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.514
THREE COST KIND OF PLACES WHERE

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:47.050
DIRECT INDIRECT AND IN OVERHEAD

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.718
SO THIS WOULD AFFECT TWO OF

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.987
THOSE THREE- IT WOULD ALLOW ZTE

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:54.891
TO REDUCE ITS RATES BY

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.393
APPROXIMATELY 10% AND I WOULD

00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:59.629
KNOW. THAT DAT UM C. D. IF THESE

00:54:59.696 --> 00:55:01.965
WERE TO PASS WOULD STILL BE A

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:03.099
PREDOMINANTLY COST RECOVERY

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.435
ORGANIZATION THIS WOULD MOVE US

00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.070
FROM ABOUT RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY-

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.340
CD T. COST RECOVERS ABOUT 86% OF

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:11.975
ITS COST WITH THE WITH THE

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:13.209
REMAINDER BEING. BY LARGE

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.311
GENERAL FUND AT THE REMAINING

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:17.180
40% THIS WOULD MOVE US. FROM

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:20.684
THAT 86% ABOUT 77% SO WE WOULD

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.286
HAVE ABOUT 23% GENERAL FUND- THE

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:27.524
OTHER PROPOSAL. IS A BY THE WAY

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.559

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.238
THAT INQUIRED OF JAN WAS JUST

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:53.076
THIS MAKE SURE. TO YOU AND- IT

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.311
IS A WAY TO AND THIS WE JUST

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.747
SHE- COSTS AROUND AND NOT REALLY

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:58.948
MAKING A SUBSTANTIVE DOES

01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:03.019
SOMETHING DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:03.853
THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN I

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.923
THINK THE QUESTION WE EVER REYES

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.625
BY INCLUDING THIS SHARK IS

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.327
WHETHER OR NOT THE PROPOSED

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.362
SHIFT OF THESE INTERNAL

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.098
ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES FROM

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.365
COST RECOVERY TO THE GENERAL

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.834
FUND WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.869
BRING RATES DOWN BY ABOUT TEN

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:22.238
PERCENT. ACROSS THE BOARD OR ON

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:24.040
AVERAGE I SHOULD SAY- WHAT'S

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:25.408
FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESSED THE

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:27.310
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT CDC IS

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.112
CHARGING FOR SOME SERVICES AND

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.012
WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.415
OFFER- WE ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.749
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.118
THE ADMINISTRATION THEY ALSO

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:36.152
NOTED THAT SOME OF THEIR

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.453
SERVICES EVEN IF THEY WERE

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.722
REDUCED TO DIRECT COSTS ONLY.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.557
WOULD STILL NOT BE COMPETITIVE

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.159
WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.727
ABSENT YOU KNOW IN DIRECTOR

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.229
OVERHEAD COSTS THERE ARE SOME

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.764
SERVICES THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT AS

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:49.966
COMPETITIVE- AND SO WE THINK

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.401
THAT THIS SUGGEST AGAIN BUT THE

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.337
NEED FOR RE RE EVALUATION

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:55.438
PROCESS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.939
THAT WILL BE TAKING PLACE OVER

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.708
THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BUT WE

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.643
THINK THE LEGISLATURE AN

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:01.911
INTEREST- IN CONTINUING TO

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.479
OVERSEE THAT PROCESS AND MAKE

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:05.081
SURE THAT SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:08.951
ABOUT PROCESSOR MADE CLEAR FOR

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.119
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. I WOULD

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.787
HAVE. IT IF YOU WOULD COME

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:12.822
FORWARD TO US FROM FROM

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.223
SUGGESTIONS OF HOW THE

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.458
LEGISLATURE COULD EXERT MORE

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:18.594
FORMAL AND REGULAR AND IN DEPTH.

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:22.198
OVERSIGHT OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:26.002
OF ACQUISITIONS. IT JUST TO ME

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.204
VERY VERY OPPRESSIVE OUT OF

01:03:28.271 --> 01:03:31.174
CONTROL AND NON FUNCTIONAL

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.276
ALMOST ALL OF OUR MAJOR HI TECH

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.511
UPGRADES AND SOME TWENTY YEARS

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.481
IN MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FAILURES

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:42.051
ARE CREDIBLY CAUSTIC. OF SENATE

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:46.355
CABALLERO. WHAT I WANT TO AGREE

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:48.191
WITH THEM WAIT WHAT'S JUST BEEN

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:50.426
SAID I GUESS WHAT I AM WHEN I

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.895
READ THIS EARLIER MY CONCERN WAS

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.730
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE WE WERE

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:57.500
SHIFTING THE COST FROM ONE IT'S

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.435
A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SHELL GAME

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:01.504
AND- AND PART OF THE CONCERN I

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:03.105
HAVE IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.908
US TO KNOW WHAT IT COSTS FOR US

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.043
TO RUN A DEPARTMENT TO DO

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.712
SOMETHING. RATHER THAN THAN-

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.981
CONTRACT FOR IT AND I'M NOT FOR

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:14.550
CONTRACTING OUT BUT- BUT WE'VE

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.018
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF OUR

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.954
DEPARTMENTS THAT DO SERVICE FOR

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.324
OTHERS- A LITTLE BIT- LEANER AND

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.959
MEANER AND WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.361
OUT IF THAT IF THAT NEEDS TO

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.562
HAPPEN IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:29.398
INSTANCE- SO AYE I SUPPORT THE

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.033
ONE YEAR AND THEN I THINK WE

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.802
HAVE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE- IN

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:36.005
THE ANALYSIS OF COST RECOVERY.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.140
AND HOW WE DO THAT IS GOING TO

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.843
BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT- I'D BE

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:44.080
MANY TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE JUST

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.248
TO LOOK AT THAT. I'M MORE MOST

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:47.650
OF A MIND TO SENATOR THAT WE DO

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.318
CREATE A LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.287
COMMITTEE. CENTER OFF YOUR

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.122
THOUGHT. FAMOUS VENTURE WHY I

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:55.791
JUST WANT TO SAY. THAT I'VE SEEN

01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.660
A GREAT DEAL OF IMPROVEMENT IN

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.329
CDC'S PERFORMANCE. AND I. T.

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.898
PROJECT- DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:05.268
ACTIVITY SINCE I LANDED IN THIS

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.068
COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:08.404
TWELVE. OBVIOUSLY THE LARGE

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:11.073
PROJECTS THAT WERE. INITIATED

01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.643
DECADES AGO LITERALLY. AND THAT

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:16.712
UNFORTUNATELY ARE STILL ONGOING-

01:05:16.779 --> 01:05:18.948
SEEM OBVIOUSLY TO BE AN

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.517
EXCEPTION BUT- AGAIN. THOSE SEEM

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.552
TO BE AN EXCEPTION I JUST WANNA.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.755
SAY THAT ABOUT CDC AND HER

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:27.923
PERSONALITY SEE AN- APPRECIATIVE

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.926
I AM OF WHAT YOU TRY TO DO. FOR

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.528
ALL THE REST OF US MY QUESTION

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.096
HOWEVER AND I LOOKED WHEN I

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:36.198
LOOKED AT THIS I WANT TO READ

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.400
THIS. PORTION OF THE ANALYSIS

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:39.101
SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHY

01:05:39.168 --> 01:05:42.104
WHY DO WE HAVE A STATE. THE DATA

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:44.507
CENTER- IF IN FACT. ENTITIES ARE

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:49.145
MIGRATING. TO THE CLOUD. AND

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.012
OTHER PER. FOR A DATA STORAGE

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:54.784
AND THE LIKE. STE THANK YOU ARE

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.319
THE SENATE ROTH FOR THE QUESTION

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.687
AGAIN REST NICHOLS THE DIRECTOR

01:05:57.753 --> 01:06:00.656
OF C. T. R. OUR STATE DATA

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:01.791
CENTER HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:03.893
QUITE SOME TIME WE HAVE A LARGE

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:05.594
MAINFRAME SYSTEM RUNS THERE IN

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.630
ADDITION TO A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:08.297
SERVICES A BULK OF STATE

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.099
ORGANIZATIONS DO HAVE THEIR

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.134
SYSTEMS ON SITE WITH WITH THEIR

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.536
CONFIDENTIAL INSTANT. AND

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.938
IMPORTANT DATA STATE SAYING AT

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.873
OUR SITE IT DOESN'T PROVIDE

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.875
ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUT IT IS NOT

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.510
THE PERFECT SOLUTION FOR EVERY

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.447
SYSTEMS OUT THERE AS SOME OF THE

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.948
NEWER SYSTEMS COME UP IN THEIR

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:27.316
CAPABILITIES HIM PRIVATE SECTOR

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.551
WE'RE ACTUALLY TO SORTING

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:31.354
PROCESS TO ALLOW OUR OUR STATE

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.756
ORGANIZATIONS TO CONSUME

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.125
APPROPRIATE- SERVICES THAT ARE

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.927
AVAILABLE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET.

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:39.362
AND IN SO THAT A SPECIFICALLY

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.930
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A COUPLE

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.198
OF OUR LARGE TENANTS IN THE

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.567
DATACENTER MOVING OFF OF THE

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.901
MAINFRAME AND IN THE CLOUD BASED

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:48.671
SOLUTIONS WHICH GENERALLY ARE

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.106
CAN BE A GOOD THING FOR THE

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.073
STATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REDUCE

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.342
THE COST OF OPERATIONS. IN THE

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:55.745
MEANTIME THOUGH WE STILL HAVE. A

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.247
LARGE NUMBER I SPOKE WITH IN THE

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:00.449
STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.551
THAT USE OF SERVICE SO. IT'S NOT

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.353
AS SIMPLE AS AS A QUICK

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.822
MIGRATION AND RANKLY OF

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.124
SERVICES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.892
ANSWERS ARE NOT ALWAYS SOLUTIONS

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:12.194
OUT THERE THAT ARE EASILY USED

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:14.130
AS A SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE OUR

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.298
BUSINESS OUT THERE AND WE HAVE

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.199
TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT'S

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:19.168
INVOLVED IN THOSE SYSTEMS TO SEE

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.970
IF WE- WANT TO TAKE THE RISK OF

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.037
HAVING THAT. MAINTAIN FIVE

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:23.272
SEPARATE ENTITY BUT TO YOUR

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.674
POINT WE DO NEED TO REEVALUATE

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:26.375
THAT BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.577
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:30.179
RATHER THAN JUST CONTINUING THE

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.480
PRACTICE THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.682
LITERALLY FOR DECADES. OUR WHOLE

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:36.051
INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.720
ARE LOOKING AT EACH AND EVERY

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.422
SERVICE OPERATED MUCH MORE LIKE

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:40.689
A PRIVATE BUSINESS THAT WE KNOW

01:07:40.756 --> 01:07:42.291
EXACTLY WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.793
THAT SERVICE WERE MEASURING

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.361
EFFECTIVENESS NOBODY CREATED BY

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:47.596
THAT SERVICE. FRANKLY IF IT IS

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:50.533
NOT SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO SAY

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:57.206
THAT OUT. LOUD IN EITHER THE

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:57.840
COMMISSION THAT SERVICE S. OR

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.975
FOR WAYS TO ITS THAT IT IS MUCH

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.377
MORE. FIVE THAT IS AREN'T WITH

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.045
THIS. PROM WELL THAT'S WHAT I

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:05.147
MEAN I WAS. TO FIND A IF THERE

TO BE DOING THIS TIME THAT WILL

01:29:21.756 --> 01:29:23.291
BE DIFFERENT. FROM WHAT YOU DID

01:29:23.357 --> 01:29:26.728
LAST TIME- THAT RESULTED IN

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.063
THESE FOURTEEN. AND THEN THERE

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.832
ISN'T ANYTHING IN HERE THAT

01:29:30.898 --> 01:29:33.067
TALKS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS WILL

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:34.235
BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING

IS THERE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT

01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.442
. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WILL

01:29:41.509 --> 01:29:44.412
BE EVALUATING AS WE DO OUR FIELD

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:47.548
SCANNED WE- WHERE IT FIRST

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:48.916
COHORT WAS A PILOT IT WAS

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.852
UNFUNDED REAR OF LEARNED A LOT

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.787
FROM IT IN WE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:54.188
LEARN FROM THAT AND IT IS OUR

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:57.892
GOAL WITH THIS MONEY TO BE ABLE

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:58.960

HAVE. LEARNED A LOT FROM THE

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.402
FIRST COHORT AND AS AND JUST

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:10.638
THAT THAT WAS A- AN UNFUNDED

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.507
MANDATE SO WE PUT OUR-

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:14.542
OPERATIONS MONEY INTO AND I JUST

01:30:14.609 --> 01:30:15.476
WANTED TO HELP THEM BECOME

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:17.411
DESIGNATED. BY THE STATE AND

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.846
ACTUALLY HELPED A LOT OF THE

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.681
CULTURE DISTRICTS. SPRINGBOARD

01:30:20.748 --> 01:30:23.818
INTO OTHER ACTIVITIES. AND

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:25.319
RECOGNITION IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

01:30:25.386 --> 01:30:26.788
BUT IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE GOING

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.990
TO ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:31.125
IN MIND IS IF THIS IS THIS- WE

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:33.528
ARE. ALLOWED TO SPENDING WE PLAN

01:30:33.594 --> 01:30:35.029

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:41.502
EXISTING WITH THE LIMITED

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:43.271
FUNDING THAT THEY HAD PRIOR.

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.472
HOWEVER THE STATE DESIGNATION

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:46.007
IT'S BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL TO

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:47.909
THEM SO WE WANT TO LOOK AND SEE

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.244
WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT HOW

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.479

FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE

01:30:53.648 --> 01:30:55.750
CURRENT COHORT THEN WE WANT TO

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:57.418
WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:59.320
ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY PANEL TO

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:02.290

IDENTIFY HOW THAT FUNDING IS

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:05.827
GOING TO OCCUR MORE. SO THAT

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:08.629

ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE ANALYZED A

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:32.780
TOTAL OF NINE PROPOSALS.

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:35.650
INCLUDING THIS ONE AS PART OF

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:36.517
THE GOVERNOR'S PUBLIC SAFETY

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:39.620
PACKAGE- WE DID RAISE CONCERNS

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.489
WITH SEVEN OF THEM AND RECENTLY

01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:43.291
RELEASED A REPORT THAT OFFERS A

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.293
BROAD FRAMEWORK FOR LEGISLATIVE

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:47.628
DELIBERATION. AS WELL AS OPTIONS

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:49.597
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.165
WE'RE GONNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY-

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.533
ON THOSE THAT RELATE

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.068
SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PROPOSAL.

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.436
AND SO SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:57.505
THIS ONE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.040
THIS PROPOSAL MAY NOT BE

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:01.175
STRUCTURED. TO ACHIEVE THE

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.777
GOVERNOR'S INSPIRED OUTCOME

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:04.512
UNTIL OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:06.614
THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REDUCE

01:33:06.681 --> 01:33:09.350
OPIOID OPIOID OVERDOSES. AS WELL

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:10.851
AS CRIMES AND VIOLENCE RELATED

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:11.852
TO THE SMUGGLING AND

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:13.988
DISTRIBUTION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS.

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.656
HOWEVER OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.491
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:18.693
LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS FOR

01:33:18.759 --> 01:33:20.661
ASSISTANCE TEND TO INVOLVE THE

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:22.930
TARGETING OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:24.231
CULTIVATION AND TRAFFICKING

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.800
WHICH CAN ALSO BE A REASON WILL

01:33:25.866 --> 01:33:28.369
TAKE LIKE ALL BUT IT IS NOT THE

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.804
SAME AS- ILLEGAL DRUGS RELATED

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:32.006
LINKS. TO OVERDOSE JUST AS- IF

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.841
THE STATE IS INTERESTED IN THAT

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:35.676
GOAL OF REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.445
THIS PROPOSAL AS IT'S CURRENTLY

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:42.116
CONSTRUCTED. MIGHT NOT BE AN

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:42.883
EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO SO. MORE

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.085
BROAD. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.920
THINKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE PUBLIC

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:47.621
SAFETY PACKAGE WE DO RECOMMEND

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:49.457
THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:50.958
ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY PUBLIC

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:53.527
SAFETY GOALS. SPECIFIED CLEAR

01:33:53.594 --> 01:33:54.628
OBJECTIVES TO ACHIEVE THOSE

01:33:54.695 --> 01:33:55.830
GOALS AND THEN PROVIDE THE

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.365
FUNDING IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES

01:33:57.431 --> 01:33:58.933
THAT THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.135
ARE ACHIEVED. SO IN TERMS OF

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.437
THINKING ABOUT- THE HIGHEST

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:04.972
PRIORITY PUBLIC SAFETY FALLS.

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.207
THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:08.275
VARIOUS CRIME RELATED OR FIRE

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:10.611
RELATED CALLS SO FOR EXAMPLE-

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.346
WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS DATA

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:13.948
INDICATED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.750
NOTABLE INCREASE AND HOMICIDES

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:17.785
AND AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. I'M A

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.954
RECENT INCREASE IN MOTOR VEHICLE

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.156
RELATED FAST GROWTH IN HOMICIDE

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.392
FIREARM TEST AS WELL AS AN

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.092
INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF

01:34:25.159 --> 01:34:28.963
HOMICIDES AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.964
AND ROBBERIES THAT INVOLVED

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:32.166
FIRE- ADDITIONALLY AS OF JANUARY

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:32.933
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY WERE

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.935
STILL NEARLY TWENTY THREE

01:34:35.002 --> 01:34:36.470
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:36.971
ON THE STATE'S LIST OF

01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.439
INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:39.774
BECAME PROHIBITED. FROM

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.975
POSSESSING FIREARMS AND

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:43.577
AMMUNITION. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE

01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.546
THAT CRIME RATES TEND TO VARY BY

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:47.915
REGION AS WELL AS TYPE OF CRIME

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:49.417
SO THIS MEANS THAT WHILE A

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.785
PARTICULAR CRIME MAY NOT BE OF

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:51.952
SIGNIFICANCE CONCERNED

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:54.422
STATEWIDE. TARGETING SPECIFIC

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:56.223
TYPES OF CRIME IN THOSE AREAS

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.158
WHERE THEY ARE IS TO BE

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:58.559
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN COULD ALSO

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:01.429
MERIT LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION.

01:35:01.495 --> 01:35:03.230
FINALLY AS AN ALTERNATIVE GIVEN

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.865
ABOUT THE TOTAL CRIME RATE IS

01:35:04.932 --> 01:35:07.201
CURRENTLY QUITE LOW RELATIVE TO

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.469
HISTORICAL STANDARDS THE

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.104
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER

01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:12.339
PRIORITIZING PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.041
THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:15.843
REDUCING CRIME. SUCH AS BETTER

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:17.778
ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.480
HOUSING NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.114
WERE INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:21.982
JUSTICE SYSTEM THERE ARE OTHER

01:35:22.049 --> 01:35:24.285
EXAMPLES AS WELL- WE'D BE HAPPY

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:26.921
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:27.922
APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU.

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:28.856
THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:31.158
TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.359
GOING TO START WITH A VICE CHAIR

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:34.762
NIELSEN. WELL TO LAST COMMENT

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:38.132
THE CRIME RATES. COMPARED TO

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:40.534
HISTORIC ARE QUITE LOW- I TEND

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:42.670
TO DISAGREE WITH YOU THERE NOT

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.572
QUITE LOW THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.707
GROWING FAST. IN IN THESE

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:49.443
PARTICULAR AREAS PARTICULARLY

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:52.046
NOW THAT IS NOT MY POINT. I'M

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.882
ALL FOR HAVING ENGAGED THE

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:57.284
NATIONAL GUARD. THAT SHOULD

01:35:57.351 --> 01:35:58.452
NEVER BE THEIR PRIMARY

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.287
RESPONSIBILITY THEY HAVE MANY

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:02.189
OTHERS GRAHAM I THINK MUCH MORE

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.291
IMPORTANT. BUT THE DEGREE THAT

01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:07.128
THE GUARD CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:08.129
TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I'M ALL

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:11.365
FOR THAT. BUT I BELIEVE AS WE-

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:14.201
EXAMINE THIS PROPOSAL- IT NEEDS

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:15.803
TO BE MORE DEFENDER THE REST OF

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.238
WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:19.306
IN WHAT MANNER AND WAIT THEY

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:21.809
WILL COOPERATE WITH LOCAL LAW

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.378
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND WHAT

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:26.180
WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY THEIR

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:29.016
IN- I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:31.118
THE AUTHORITY TO BE ARRESTING

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:35.055
AND- A PROSECUTING. SO WHAT WILL

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:38.559
BE THAT- THAT SUPPORT. THE VOTE

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:41.629
I'M JUST REQUESTING THE LIVE.

01:36:41.695 --> 01:36:43.697
FIND MERIT IN THE PROPOSAL I

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:45.666

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:56.277
DEALING WITH CANNABIS IN ANOTHER

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:58.279
SETTING- AND UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.181
WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:01.448
WITH THE WAY THE- CANNABIS

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.350
PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED AND

01:37:03.417 --> 01:37:07.188
CONTINUES TO BE- OPERATING- WE

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:09.223
CERTAINLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH.

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:12.092

OTHER ASPECTS OF THE CANNABIS-

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:33.247
SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA I THINK

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:34.848
THAT WOULD BE VALUABLE SO IF WE

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.917

02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:24.276
SCHOOLS- AND GIVE THAT TO THE

02:01:24.343 --> 02:01:25.444
CITIES AND COUNTIES TO REIMBURSE

02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:28.014
ARE REALISTS LAW. SO IN ESSENCE

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:29.015
WHAT'S HAPPENING THESE ACCESS

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:31.050
NEARMAP COUNTIES IS PROPERTY TAX

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:33.019
REVENUE IS BEING TAKEN FROM THE

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:35.121
NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS. TO

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.689
REIMBURSE THE CITIES AND THE

02:01:36.756 --> 02:01:38.124
COUNTIES. AND UNDER TEST ONE OF

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.392
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.427
ACTUALLY HAS A VERY ARTIFACT AND

02:01:41.494 --> 02:01:43.095
WHAT IT DOES IS IT WINDS UP IN

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:47.500
EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE.

02:01:47.566 --> 02:01:48.367
LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THAT.

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:50.436
BECAUSE UNDER TEST ONE. THERE'S

02:01:50.503 --> 02:01:52.371
A FIXED PART OF ABOUT 38% OF THE

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:54.707
STATE GENERAL FUND IT GOES TO

02:01:54.774 --> 02:01:55.808
THE SCHOOLS. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:58.044
IS GOING BACK TO MY EXAMPLE THAT

02:01:58.110 --> 02:01:59.345
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS TAKEN

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.746
FROM THE SCHOOLS. AND GIVEN TO

02:02:00.813 --> 02:02:02.982
THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.383
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS BACK FIELD

02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:07.286
FROM THAT X. HOT OF. 38% OF

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.888
GENERAL FUND FOR THEIR BALLOTS.

02:02:08.954 --> 02:02:10.222
AND SO THAT HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:02:10.289 --> 02:02:12.024
COMES OUT OF THE POT AND GOES TO

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:13.192
THE COUNTY SCHOOLS IN THAT

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.061
COUNTY. AND THAT MEANS EVERY

02:02:15.127 --> 02:02:17.730
OTHER SCHOOL IN THE STATE HAS

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:18.864
LOST ACCESS THAT ONE HUNDRED

02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:20.700
DOLLARS. THANK YOU ANOTHER. YOU

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:21.701

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:36.348
YOU UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:38.484
