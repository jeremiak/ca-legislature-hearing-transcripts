THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR MAS WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN LOW FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR A LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED AS A JOINT. RTO ON THIS BILL I THINK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE IN TERMS OF EXPUNGEMENT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PENALIZE- THESE INDIVIDUALS- PROFESSIONAL LICENSE IF THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN I BELIEVE THIS IS THE- THE CERTAINLY CONSISTENT WITH WHERE. THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO IN TERMS OF THE JUSTICE- ERROR THAT WE IN AND I THINK IT'S FALLS THE SQUARELY IN LINE WITH THAT IN THE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE- MEMBER LOCAL BRING IT IS FOR IT AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY AND WOULD LOVE TO BE CONSIDERED. TO BE A PARTNER IN AND ON THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GIBSON MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND ALSO IF YOU ARE TAKING. CO AUTHORS I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AND I JUST LIKE TO SHARE BRIEFLY SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM THE LEGAL PROCESS INVOLVED IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC THING TO GET AN EXPUNGEMENT IT'S THE TECHNICAL TERMS PETITION FOR DISMISSAL. IF IT'S A MISDEMEANOR YOU HAVE TO SERVE OUT YOUR ENTIRE PROBATION PERIOD BEFORE YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR IT THEN YOU HAVE TO PETITION THE COURT THE COURT MUST GRANT IF YOU HAVEN'T. VIOLATED YOUR PROBATION OR COMMITTED NEW OFFENSES- BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC FOR A FELONY IT GOES BEFORE THE JUDGE THAT SENTENCED YOU FOR HEARING AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW WHY IT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE TO HAVE A FELONY CONVICTION EITHER DISMISSED OR REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR AND THEN- DISMISSED I'VE HANDLED MANY OF THESE CASES FOR LEGAL CLIENTS OVER THE YEARS. AND I'D SAY DESPITE ME TELLING EVERY SINGLE CLIENT I'VE EVER HAD AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE CASE HEY THE DAY YOU GET OFF PROBATION YOU NEED TO CALL BECAUSE WE GOT A FILE FOR YOUR PETITION FOR DISMISSAL. LESS THAN HALF OF THEM DO IT SO THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET THE RECORD CLEANED UP ARE MOTIVATED THEY'VE ALREADY SHOWN THAT THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL IN TERMS OF BASIC FAIRNESS I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT FORWARD.
