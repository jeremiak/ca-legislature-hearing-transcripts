00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:58.930
AS CRITERIA FOR US IS THE STATE

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:01.332
TO LEAVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.034
AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:06.804
AS TO WHAT THE SCIENCE- WILL-

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:10.608
STATES FOR. US AS A STATE. YEAH

TRAFFIC OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:21.152
SO I YOU KNOW ALL OF US ALL OF

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.121
US HAVE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:26.191
AMOUNT OF IT THERE THE- THE

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:29.127
FIRST COPY TO- THE AGENT THAT

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:31.029
CAUSES THAT THE COUPLE BECOMING

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:33.064
NINETEEN PANDEMIC KEPT REALLY

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.900
THROWING US SOME CURVEBALLS IF

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:36.834
WE REMEMBER. AFTER JUNE

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.304
FIFTEENTH WE ARE COMING OUT WE

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.905
THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DO

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.440
REALLY WELL THEN THE DELTA

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.575
VARIANCE CAME. WITH ALL

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:46.978
DIFFERENT WAS MORE VIRULENT AND

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:48.580
IT WAS MORE TRANSMISSIBLE. THEN

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.748
THE- MAKRAN VARYING CAME. ACROSS

00:30:50.815 --> 00:30:52.717
VERY WAS DIFFERENT IT WAS LESS

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:55.420
RELIANT COSTLESS DISEASE BUT IT

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:56.487
HAD A MUNIS CAPE THAT MEANS

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.289
PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINATED OR HAD

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.425
PRIOR INFECTION IS ABLE TO

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.760
OVERCOME OVERCOME THAT HAND IT

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:05.830
WAS. INCREDIBLY INFECTIOUS AND

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:06.898
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

00:31:06.965 --> 00:31:08.199
LEARNING MOVING FORWARD IS.

00:31:08.266 --> 00:31:10.868
BECAUSE MOST TRANSMISSION

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:12.971
HAPPENS. WHEN PEOPLE ARE A

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.006
SYMPTOMATIC. THE FOR THE VIRUS

00:31:15.073 --> 00:31:16.841
THE THOUGHT HAVE AN EVOLUTIONARY

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:19.611
REASON FOR IT TO BECOME LESS

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:21.813
VIRULENT OVERTIME. WE HAVE SO

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.681
MUCH TRANSITION HAPPENING ALL

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.384
OVER THE WORLD THAT WE'RE GOING

00:31:26.451 --> 00:31:28.186
TO BE FACING NEW VARIANTS SOME

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:29.787
OF THEM MAY HAVE SOME OF AND HOW

00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:31.823
HOW THEY'RE VERY IT PRESENTS

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:32.957
ITSELF IT MAY BECOME MORE

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:34.993
VIRULENT MORE TALK MORE

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:36.427
TRANSMISSIBLE AND MAY HAVE

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:38.196
REPORTED MEAN ESCAPE. SO WE'RE

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:41.933
REALLY FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW. MR

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.202
HALF COURT INFRASTRUCTURE SO

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.803
THAT WE HAVE GOOD SURVEILLANCE

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:48.506
AND TO RESPOND TO ANY ADDITIONAL

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:49.474
VARIANTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.743
COMPANY HAD. BOB AND I WERE

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:53.211
HOPING THAT IN THE COMING IN THE

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:55.313
COMING WEEKS I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.547
MONTHS WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.383
GET A BETTER FEEL FOR HOW THIS

00:31:58.449 --> 00:32:00.985
IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. IT IT'S SO

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:02.387
HARD TO PREDICT RIGHT NOW WITH

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:05.356
RESPECT TO THE- DICK DECLARATION

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:07.125
OF EMERGENCY YOU KNOW WHAT WE

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:10.461
HAVE TO GO BACK AND SPEAK TO-

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:14.532
ADMIT. THE MINISTRATION AND GET

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:16.501

YOU FOR THAT DOCTOR ARE GONE AND

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.437
BELIEVE IT'S A NECESSARY

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:23.174
CONVERSATION FOR US TO HAVE AS-

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.376
AN INSTITUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:28.913
WE ARE- PROTECTING IN DOING OUR

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.982
DUE DILIGENCE IN OVERSIGHT.

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:32.950
WHILE I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:34.719
THE ADMINISTRATION RUNNING THIS

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:37.355
BILL THROUGH THE NORMAL. PROCESS

00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:39.557
I BELIEVE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:42.126
ALLOWED YOU AND GAVE YOU EXTRA

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:44.595
POWERS TO BE ABLE TO. RUN IT

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.397
THROUGH THE JAIL BC OR ANOTHER

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:49.000

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:51.035
SURE WE HAVE SPECIFIC CRITERIA

AND METRICS THAT WERE ANALYZING

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:56.741
TO DETERMINE WHEN. WE WILL. BE

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:59.277
ABLE TO LEAVE THE STATE OF

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:01.946
EMERGENCY. AS I BELIEVE THAT

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:04.582
WILL RESTORE AND CREATE THE

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.184
RIGHT BALANCE THAT WE NEED

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.118

STAFFING AND THE PANDEMIC THAT

TRY TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THESE

00:35:19.183 --> 00:35:21.953
PATTERNS. FOR EXAMPLE NORMALLY

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:23.421
ONE REGION IN THE STATE AS

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.022

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:42.673
THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WILL SAY

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.910
THAT. CURRENTLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.311
OUR MEDICAL RESOURCES ACROSS THE

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.380
STATE THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:51.449
ONE PARTICULAR REGION THAT IS

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:52.817
MORE HEAVILY SUPPORTED THAN

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:55.219
ANOTHER HOWEVER THE VERY FAR

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.121

NEED THE LAST. HELP IN THIS AREA

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:10.568
BUT I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.203
SOMETHING TO TAKE BACK TO INFORM

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.539
FUTURE FUNDING DECISIONS SO THAT

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:16.841

TEN YEARS IN THE ER AND THE

00:36:34.191 --> 00:36:35.860

THEY PICK UP IN THE FIELD AND

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:46.304
TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

THEY NEED AND I'M HOPING THAT

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:14.031
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COMMENT.

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.466

CONTINUUM OF CARE HOLISTICALLY

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:22.660
AND WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO.

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:24.295
MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT-

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.263

WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:44.648
IMPROVING. BUT NO THAT IT

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:47.918
DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS RURAL AREAS

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:50.554
LIKE MINE IF HOSPITALS. ARE TIED

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:53.491
IN OR IF THE AMBULANCES ARE.

00:39:53.557 --> 00:39:55.526

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.869
ASK MY FINAL QUESTION FOR THE

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:07.471
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- REGARDING

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.774

COVERT COSTS DO YOU ANTICIPATE

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.012
WHAT PORTION OF THIS WILL BE

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:23.821

EXACTLY WILL BE REIMBURSED BUT I

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.287

TAKE BACK. AND PROVIDE SOME HIGH

00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:00.558

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.923
THINK WE HAVE STE WE BELIEVE

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:14.491
WE'VE GOT A LANGUAGE STRIKES A

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.493
CAREFUL BALANCE. BETWEEN

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.328
ENSURING THAT WE'RE MEETING OUR

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.096
FUNCTIONS OF THE OFFICE AND

00:53:20.163 --> 00:53:22.465
ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED BY

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.668
STAKEHOLDERS. THE HOSPITAL

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.603
ASSOCIATIONS- URGE THAT NO

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.405
HEALTHCARE ENTITIES SHOULD BE

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:32.008
HEALTH OF A SPECIAL STANDARD OR

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.009
OR A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:34.444
ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THEIR PART

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:35.378
OF THE ASSOCIATION OF HEALTHCARE

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.113
DISTRICTS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.349
ABOUT COST TARGETS THAT TAKE A

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:41.084
ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:43.153
MAY NOT BE ACHIEVABLE FOR SMALL

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:46.423
RURAL CRITICAL ACCESS FACILITIES

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.024
. H. KIND VERY MCH AGREES WITH

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:50.160
THE PRINCIPLE OF ALL AND AS WELL

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.728
AS THE NEED FOR SOME VERY

00:53:51.795 --> 00:53:53.430
ABILITY AND INDIVIDUALIZED

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:57.033
DETERMINATIONS. I APOLOGIZE THAT

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:01.338
THE MAILBOX WAS HERE. ALL RIGHT-

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.506
SO THE OFFICE WILL ABSOLUTELY

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.609
START WITH AN ALL IN APPROACH IN

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:08.845
TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION AND THE

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.547
TOTAL COST OF CARE CALCULATION-

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.382
WILL INCLUDE DATA FROM ALL

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:14.084
SECTORS OF THE HEALTH CARE

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.518
ENOUGH. TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:17.487
FULL PICTURE OF HEALTHCARE COSTS

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.022
THIS ALL AND APPROACHES HE AND I

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.824
THINK THERE'S BROAD STAKEHOLDER

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.692
AGREEMENT ABOUT THAT. BUT THEN

00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:23.860
THERE ARE ANUMBER OF PLACES

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.528
WHERE A MORE NUANCED APPROACH-

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:27.163
INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH IS

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.199
WARRANTED. THE TRAILER BOAT

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:30.967
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.235
USE OF A RISK ADJUSTMENT

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:34.537
METHODOLOGY FOR THE COST MARKETS

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:36.206
THAT WE THINK ADDRESSES SOME OF

00:54:36.272 --> 00:54:38.675
THE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS WHOSE

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:40.677
ARMS. ARTICLE THREE OF THE BILL

00:54:40.744 --> 00:54:42.379
SETS FORTH THE PROCESS AND

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.446
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COST

00:54:43.513 --> 00:54:45.215
TARGETS AND ALLOWS THE BOARD

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.183
SPECIFICALLY TO ADJUST COST

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.918
MARKETS WHEN WARRANTED. TO

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:53.089
ACCOUNT FOR THE BASELINE COST

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:54.658
ADDITIONALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:55.992
ADJUSTING TARGETS THE OFFICE

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.327
WILL SOMETIMES HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:54:57.394 --> 00:55:00.030
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:01.765
THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THAT. A

00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:02.999
PARTICULAR ENTITY DOESN'T MEET

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.001
THE COST TARGET WOULD MEET WITH

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:06.369
THE OFFICE AND PROVIDE DATA

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:08.371
EXPLAINING THE COST OVERRUN SO

00:55:08.438 --> 00:55:10.640
WE COULD ENVISION THAT BEING-

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:11.875
HIGHER RATES PAID DUE TO A

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.243
SCARCITY OF A PARTICULAR KIND OF

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:15.045
SPECIALIST. A SICKER PATIENT

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.414
POPULATION FOUR INVESTMENT IN A

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.550
CARE MANAGEMENT OR OR ELECTRONIC

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.318
HEALTH RECORD I. T. SYSTEM. THE

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.787
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRES

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:26.589
THE OFFICE IN EVALUATING WHETHER

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.724
AN ENTITY COMPLIED WITH THE COST

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.893
TARGET TO CONSIDER EACH ENTITY'S

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.928
CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH TO COST

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.963
GROWTH IN EXCESS OF THE APPLE

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:36.466
PARK IT. ACTORS THE CONTRIBUTE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:37.834
TO SPENDING IN EXCESS OF THE

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:39.269
TARGET AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.771
EACH ENTITY HAS CONTROL OVER THE

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:43.006
COMPONENTS OF THE TARGET SO WE

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.774
REALLY THIS LANGUAGE WAS ALL

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.477
CRAFTED ON THE RESPONSE TO OUR

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.144
OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.846
STAKEHOLDERS. WE THINK WE'VE

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:51.514
DEVELOPED AN INDIVIDUAL UP

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:53.083
APPROACH THAT ALLOWS FOR

00:55:53.149 --> 00:55:55.685
INDIVIDUALIZED DETERMINATIONS-

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:58.021
TO BE USED AS NEEDED. THE

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.222
HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO OR

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:01.357
JUST THROW STAKEHOLDER. TO SET

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.759
THE COST TARGETS AND WE VERY

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:04.661
MUCH AGREE WITH THAT SO THE

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.262
LANGUAGE REQUIRES PUBLIC BOARD

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:07.363
MEETINGS THAT WOULD BE AN

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.832
IMPORTANT VENUE FOR STAKEHOLDER

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:10.967
ENGAGEMENT. AND THE BOARD WOULD

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.335
ACTUALLY BE REQUIRED TO HOLD A

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:13.837
BOARD MEETING TO DISCUSS

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:16.039
TARGETS- PUBLIC COMMENT WOULD OF

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.241
COURSE BE HEARD AND THEN- THE

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:20.076
TARGETS COULDN'T. COULDN'T BE

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:21.177
SAID AT THAT MEETING BUT THERE

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.612
WOULD HAVE TO BE A SUBSEQUENT

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.280
MEETING SO WE FELT THEN THE

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:25.849
OPPORTUNITY FOR ROBUST

00:56:25.915 --> 00:56:29.285
STAKEHOLDER. ENGAGEMENT THE

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:30.854
HOSPITALS HAVE ALSO RAISED A

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.522
CONCERN ABOUT LOWER RATES PAID

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:34.591
BY MEDICAID AND MEDICARE AND

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.726
THAT THAT REQUIRES- OF THE

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:38.962
HIGHER COMMERCIAL RATES. AND SO

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:41.131
AGAIN WE'RE STARTING FROM- IF

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.766
THAT'S BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.802
NOW- THEN THAT IS AN INPUT. AND

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.604
DATA FROM PUBLIC PAYERS WILL BE

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.373
INCLUDED IN TESTIMONY ON THIS

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.475
POINT WILL BE CONSIDERED. MOVING

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.377
ON TO ACCESS AND QUALITY THE

00:56:54.444 --> 00:56:56.146
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS URGED THE

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:58.014
COST MARKETS NOT BE BASED ON A

00:56:58.081 --> 00:56:59.916
PER CAPITA BASIS AND ADDRESS

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:02.352
ONLY THE RATE OF GROWTH NOT- CUT

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.620
EXISTING HEALTHCARE SPENDING

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:06.489
LEVELS AND AGAIN- WE DID MODIFY

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:07.891
THE DEFINITION OF HEALTHCARE

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:11.427
COSTS FOR. IN RESPONSE TO THIS

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:13.296
CONCERT LAST YEAR. THE HOSPITALS

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:15.131
OF ALL OBJECT DEFECTOR PARKING

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:17.100
AND ARE THE- DIFFERENT TARGETS

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:19.569
AMONG. CAN RESULT IN HIGH RISK

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:22.372
PATIENTS GETTING SHUFFLED TO

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.274
PROVIDERS SEEKING TO AVOID.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.509
TRIPPING THE COST GROWTH MARKETS

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.545
AS PREVIOUSLY IT'S CRITICAL TO

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:29.946
START WITH AN ALL IN APPROACH

00:57:30.013 --> 00:57:31.447
AND THEN WE DO ALLOW SOME

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:33.249
INDIVIDUALIZED ANALYSIS IS

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:36.386
NEEDED IF A PARTICULAR SECTOR OR

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:39.656
ENTITY- THEY GO OVER THE COST

00:57:39.722 --> 00:57:41.090
TARGET. GIVEN SOME SECTORS MAY

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.959
PLAY AN OUTSIZE ROLE IN

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:44.227
CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASING

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.162
COST OF CARE WE BELIEVE IT'S

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:47.764
IMPORTANT FOR THE BOARD TO BE

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.767
ABLE TO SET SECTOR MARKETS. WE

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.001
HAVE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.236
SETTING OF SECTOR TARGETS BE

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:55.171
DONE IN A MANNER THAT MINIMIZES

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.940
FRAGMENTATION AND POTENTIAL

00:57:57.006 --> 00:58:00.076
OPTION THING. AND THE COURAGE'S

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:01.277
CAUGHT COOPERATION AMONG THE

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:05.081
ENTITIES. THE NEXT WE ARE ASKED

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.916
TO ADDRESS- IS ABOUT THE

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:09.252
SPORTSMAN'S- SO HEALTH URGE THAT

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:11.154
THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROCESS BE

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:13.823
ALLOWED AND FOR THAT- AND THAT

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.792
THE OFF SHOULDN'T CELEBRATE

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.894
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BUT BUT

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.096
SHOULD ALLOW A LOT OF.

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:20.964
COLLABORATION AND WE THINK THIS

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:23.499
IS EXACTLY THE ENFORCEMENT

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:24.734
APPROACH IN OUR LANGUAGE. THE

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.269
OFFICE WILL ENFORCE THE COST

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:28.271

WOULD BE- WOULD BE- I'VE- THINK

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.689
IT WOULD BE THAT DEBT. QUITE

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.591
FRANKLY SOME OF THE DUPLICATION.

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:20.563
SOME OF IT IS- IS- HI HI HI

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.465
TREATMENT LOW OUT THE POSITIVE

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:24.667
OUTCOME. THERE'S SO IT'SJUST

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:26.802
GONNA TAKE SOME TIME. TO GET

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:28.404
SORT THROUGH THIS AND I USE THIS

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:31.140
EXAMPLE. OF A LOT BECAUSE IT

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.908
STICKS IT STUCK WITH ME I CAN'T

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.478
I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY- WE KNOW

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:37.480
THAT- FROM STUDIES I BELIEVE IT

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.048
WAS THE CHC OF STUDY THAT

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.850
BROUGHT THIS UP A FEW YEARS AGO.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:43.719
IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE-

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.621
THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:47.223
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THANIT IS

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:50.860
IN CHESTER COUNTY BY ABOUT 20%

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.062
AND ARGUABLY- AND AS ACTUALLY

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:55.998
ACTUALLY NOT ARGUABLY ITS IT'S-

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:58.701
FACT FACT FACTUALLY- THE

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.569
OUTCOMES AND THE QUALITY CARE IN

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.038
SAN DIEGO TEND TO BE BETTER SO

01:09:03.105 --> 01:09:04.840
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES SAN DIEGO

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.642
AND SO CALIFORNIA ABLE TO

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.277
PROVIDE HIGHER QUALITY CARE AT A

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:10.246
LOWER COST IS IT THE RURAL

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.548
NATURE OF SHASTA COUNTY IS IT IS

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.417
IT- IS IT HE PER THE A LARGE

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.552
NUMBER PROVIDERS POTENTIALLY

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:18.187
AVAILABLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WE

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:20.990
DON'T KNOW- IN THE I BELIEVE IN

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:23.125
THE LONG RUN. THAT THAT AN

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.994
OFFICE LIKE THIS WILL HAVE GIVE

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.428
US OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THIS

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:29.665
AND A MYRIAD OF OTHER ISSUES-

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:31.467
THAT- THAT ACCOUNT FOR WHAT

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:33.235
DRIVES THE COST OF COSTS OF

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:35.404
HEALTH CARE- WHAT IS IT WASN'T

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.506
SAID IS THAT THE- IN GENERAL IN

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:38.807
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS MY TIME IN

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:40.543
THE LEGISLATURE THE COST OF

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.011
HEALTH CARE HAS RISEN AT TWICE

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.547
THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND THAT

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.149
IS SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SO

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.552
THE IDEA IS HOW DO WE GET THIS

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:51.587
CLOSER TO INFLATION OR MAYBE

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.656
EVEN A TOUCH BELOW INFLATION IF

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.391
WE WERE TO BE REALLY OPTIMISTIC

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.793
HERE BUT BUT I DID IT IS REALLY

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.929
UNFATHOMABLE IT WE CANNOT GET

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.530
CLOSER TO THAT THE RATE OF

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.132
INFLATION- ME TO ROADS PEOPLE

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.467
SALARIES ERODES PEOPLE'S COST OF

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.270
LIVING- AND IN THE END- ARE WE

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.239
PROVIDING THE SERVICES REALLY

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.741
VALUABLE TO THEM- AS AS AS WE GO

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:15.244
FORWARD SO. SO I WANT TO JUST

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:16.612
HIT ONE ONE THING AND THEN WHEN

01:10:16.679 --> 01:10:18.547
TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR- AND

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.815
ONCE AGAIN JUST OF MY GRATITUDE

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.850
TOWARDS TO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:22.751
FOR CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US ON

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:25.788
THIS- WE DO HAVE A BILL AB

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.456
ELEVEN THIRTY- SINCE SENATE

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:32.061
HEALTH- THE LANGUAGE WILL BE.

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.163
IDENTICAL AT SOME POINT- TO

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.532
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE- AND WE'RE

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:38.000
HOPING THAT THE SENATE- ACTUALLY

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.369
WERE EXPECTING THE SENATE- TO BE

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:43.372
ABLE TO- HERE THIS EARLY- AND AS

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.074
WE MOVE FORWARD- THROUGH THE

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:45.708
PROCESS BUT ON THE QUESTION OF

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.409
ENFORCEMENT I JUST WANT TO SAY

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.478
YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A THIS

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:51.647
IS THE ONE PIECE THAT I THINK IN

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:52.815
GENERAL HAS RAISED A LOT OF

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:56.518
CONCERN. AMONG PEOPLE AND IT

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.920
ISN'T MEANT TO BE UNITIVE-

01:10:57.987 --> 01:10:59.622
THERE'S GONNA BE PLENTY OF A-

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:00.489
FOR. ACTIONS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.391
REVIEW. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.959
YOU'VE GONE OVER YOUR TARGET

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.828
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING-

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:07.796
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:08.464
INVESTMENTS THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.366
THING- IF YOU'VE GONE OVER YOUR

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.801
TARGET BECAUSE YOUR- YOU HAVE

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.370
FOR OTHER REASONS. WE WANT TO

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.804
GIVE YOU TH OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.306
CORRECTION ACTION CORRECTIVE

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:20.009
ACTION. AND THERE WILL BE IT

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.944
THAT THE FINE IS POTENTIALLY BUT

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.846
THE LAST THING ON THE LIST SO.

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.280
SO MY HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.081
JUST BEGIN TO CHANGE THEIR

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:27.783
BEHAVIOR. THINK ABOUT HOW THEIR

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.051
HOW THEIR PROCESS HOW THE

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.185
PROCESSING CARE OR PROCESSING

FEES AND THINGS FOR CARE- AND

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.689
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE REAL

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:35.290
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THIS

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:36.992
THAT ARE. HAVING TO PAY- PAY

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.895
THESE BILLS AND- THEY'RE ANGRY

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.764
THEY'RE FRUSTRATED AND THEY'RE

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.465
SCARED BY THE RISING COST OF

01:11:43.532 --> 01:11:45.234

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.415
