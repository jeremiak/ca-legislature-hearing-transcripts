00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.501
IMPORTANT WOOD- WHAT THE AUTHOR

IS DOING. A TO TRY TO MOVE THIS

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.606
ALONG CERTAINLY- IN MY WORKING

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.174
WITH LOCAL REGIONAL GOVERNMENT

00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:51.977
BEEN A HUGE ISSUE TO TRY TO GET

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:52.945
SOME UNIFORMITY AND- SOME

00:16:53.011 --> 00:16:55.013
STREAMLINING GOING AND WE DON'T

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.648
ALWAYS GET THE COOPERATION OF

SOMETIMES OF OUR OWN PLANNING

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:01.487
PROFESSIONALS- THAT SAID THERE'S

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:03.856
THREE AREAS GOING FORWARD THERE

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.657
ARE A I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK UP

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:08.193
WITH- A LOT OF CONCERN IN IN I

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.296
SEE THAT- CERTAINLY IF. THE

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:14.800
AUTHOR WANTS TO RESPOND. BUT NOW

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:16.201
WE'RE DURING HIS CLOTHES- SO

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.036
WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR

00:17:18.103 --> 00:17:19.905
THAT'S THAT'S UP TO THE AUTHOR

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:20.572
BUT- MORE THAN ANYTHING I JUST

00:17:20.639 --> 00:17:22.374
WANT TO FLAG THESE THREE ISSUES

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.276
FOR ME BECAUSE- IT COULD COME

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:27.146
DOWN. THE TWO FOUR VOTE AT SOME

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:30.315
POINT- I'VE BEEN PRETTY CLEAR ON

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:33.485
THE RECORD- THAT IN IN MY NECK

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.921
OF THE WOODS PREDOMINATELY-

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:36.922
PARTICULAR THE EAST SIDE OF MY

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:40.025
DISTRICT- THAT WE TYPICALLY USE.

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:42.628
AN EIGHT HUNDRED FOOT THE

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:45.197
QUARTER MILE PEDESTRIAN-

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:48.600
LIMITATION IF YOU WILL OF. FOR A

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:50.969
PARKING AROUND TRANSIT STOPS

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.371
WERE WERE JUST PEDESTRIAN

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.307
FRIENDLY A TRANSIT STOPS- I

00:17:55.374 --> 00:17:56.308
THINK CENTER BECAUSE OF

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.576
NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS YOU KNOW A

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:58.477
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I'M

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.312
TALKING ABOUT THE AREA IN THE

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:03.382
TRANSIT AGENCY WORK BILL- TO BE

00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:06.118
WALKABLE- AT HELP AT HALF MILE

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:08.954
DISTANCES TO BE SAFE A NUMBER OF

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:11.490
LEVELS AT THOSE DISTANCES SO. OF

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.725
MY CONSTITUENTS- HAVE A BIG

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:16.929
PROBLEM WITH THAT- SO YOU KNOW

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:19.832
REDUCING THAT DOWN WOULD BE AN

00:18:19.898 --> 00:18:24.069
ISSUE SIMILARLY- ON THE HEIGHT.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:26.171
LIMITS WHICH I'M READING THE

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:28.807
BILL AS A TWENTY FIVE FOOT BY

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.009
RIGHT- WOULD REALLY FLY IN THE

00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:32.778
FACE OF COMMITMENTS I'VE MADE TO

00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:33.812
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN MY

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:35.280
DISTRICT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:36.815
SOME DISCRETION AROUND HEIGHTS

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.717
INCLUDING THE RECENT SB NINE

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.486
DISCUSSION WHICH I WAS WAS A

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:42.387
PROUD CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.056
ABOVE ALSO HAD. TO WORK REALLY

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:45.958
REALLY HARD YOU KNOW WITH FIFTY

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:46.925
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MY

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.995
JURISDICTION TO REASSURE THEM

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:52.598
THAT- WE UNDERSTAND OR

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:53.632
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.201
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE- HI. HER

00:18:56.268 --> 00:18:57.402
LACK OF HEIGHT LIMITATIONS

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.705
CANNOT JUST BE A BY RIGHT ISSUE

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.340
SO I ENDED UP THERE SOMETHING

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:03.208
MORE THAT CAN BE DONE WORKING ON

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.611
THAT. IN THE LAST WEEK- CODE

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:09.248
ISSUES AGAIN I WANT TO HARKEN

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:11.250
BACK TO THE MOST REDLINED

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:13.752
PORTION OF MY DISTRICT- WHICH

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.888
WHICH EIGHT EIGHT I THINK AGAIN

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.589
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO WRITE I

00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.291
THINK THE BE THE GREED THAT WE

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.993
HAVE A VERY RED LINED UP THE

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.263
SIDE OF OUR DISTRICT- IN THAT

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:27.332
AREA WE HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.268
CODE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IN IN A

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.303
SORT OF THE ILLEGAL EIGHTY USE

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.272
SEPARATE CONVERTED GARAGES AND

00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:35.908
SO FORTH I NOTED THAT- IN THE

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:37.609
ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT SAN

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:42.247
FRANCISCO HAVING. OF PERHAPS 8%

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.049
HELLO NINE CODE COMPLIANT EIGHTY

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.817
USE THAT ARE OUT THERE

00:19:45.884 --> 00:19:46.485
ESSENTIALLY ILLEGAL EIGHTY YEARS

00:19:46.552 --> 00:19:49.321
I WOULD. I WOULD. SUBMIT I DON'T

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.189
HAVE THE DATA FOR THAT IN THE

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.824
SIDE OF MY DISTRICT THE NUMBER

00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:54.860
IS FAR HIGHER THAN THAT. IN AN

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:58.797
ADULT IN EIGHT I DON'T. I

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.899
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL SAYS-

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.200
THAT THERE'S ONLY AMNESTY IF

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:03.936
THERE'S NO HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.237
VIOLATIONS BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.306
WHAT THOSE. WOULD BE PRESCRIBED

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.908
TO BE- OR OR HOW LOCAL

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:10.709
GOVERNMENTS WOULD INTERPRET

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:13.512
THAT. HE I JUST THINK IT'S

00:20:13.579 --> 00:20:15.013
HUGELY IMPORTANT HERE TO

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.615
PREVENT. FRANKLY SOME OF THE

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.050
CONDITIONS WERE SEEN RIGHT NOW

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.384
IN TERMS OF HABITABILITY IN

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.054
TERMS OF. FIRE SAFETY IN TERMS

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.990

SMALL SPACES SO- THERE'S LOTS

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.433
AND LOTS OF GREAT STUFF IN THIS

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:37.436
BILL- SO I PAY HEED TO FOCUS ON

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.438
THE THREE THINGS THAT. I WOULD

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:41.406
BE LOOKING FOR SOME CONTINUE TO

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:44.576
WORK ON AND- AND NOT HIGHLIGHT

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:45.544
ALL THE ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.846
BEEN. YOU KNOW REALLY I THINK

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.281

IN THE BILL ON THE POSITIVE SIDE%

BUT- I'M TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IN

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:02.694
TERMS OF. WHAT I THINK IS FOR ME

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:04.329
AND PERHAPS THE- SOME OF OUR

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:05.731
CALL GOING TO BE THE CHAU.

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:07.299

MILE THAT WAS PART OF- AB TEN

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.085
SIXTY NINE THAT ALLOW PEOPLE

THAT WAS SORT OF A STATE WIDE.

00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:38.797
IT COMPROMISE THAT WE TOOK SIX

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:41.333
YEARS AGO- THERE WERE PEOPLE

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.902
THAT OBJECTED TO THAT AT THE

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:46.571
TIME AND I. I REPRESENT THE EAST

UNINCORPORATED AREAS JUST PEOPLE

00:21:57.683 --> 00:21:58.817
GO THROUGH BUT THAT'S WE DON'T

00:21:58.884 --> 00:21:59.851
KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE AN

00:21:59.918 --> 00:22:01.586
ABUNDANCE OF ITS BEING MADE BUT

00:22:01.653 --> 00:22:02.454
THAT WAS SORT OF THIS. LET'S

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.456
MAKE IT AS AN EASY THING SO I'M

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.291

DISCUSSION AND WHAT WE DIDN'T

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.579
REALIZE IS THAT YOU NEED TO

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:32.317
CRAWL SPACE. IN YOUR HOUSE THE

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.952

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:50.168
OKAY WITH THAT RIGHT- BUT

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:52.104
SIXTEEN FEET IS SORT OF A

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:52.971
TRICKSTER'S WAY OF SAYING THAT

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.639
YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE STORY. AND

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:57.042
THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT I HAVE

00:22:57.109 --> 00:22:58.610
A PERSON ON MY LEFT SIDE OF MY

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.445
HOUSE TO MY RIGHT SAID HOUSE ALL

00:23:00.512 --> 00:23:02.380
HAVE TWO STORY BUILDINGS AND IF

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:04.916
I WANT TO PUT A- EIGHTY WILL FOR

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:06.284
MY GARAGE WHICH IS SMALLER THAN

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:07.786
THE TWO STORY ADDITIONS. I

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.221
TECHNICALLY COULDN'T DO IT

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:10.789
BECAUSE IT'S OVER SIXTEEN FEET

00:23:10.856 --> 00:23:12.724
OR I WOULD HAVE TO TRANSMITTER

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.392
PEOPLE WE'VE HAD REPORTS FROM

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:15.660
EACH CITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:18.029
TRENCHING. JUST TO GET THE

00:23:18.096 --> 00:23:20.432
FOUNDATION IN AND SOME SORT OF

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:22.801
PROOF BECAUSE- AGAIN I WAS. NO I

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:23.769
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MAGIC

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:25.270
NUMBER IS BUT THAT'S WHAT THE

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.572
IDEA IS I DON'T WANT IT TO BE.

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.406
BIGGER AND BETTER THAN WHAT

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:30.909
EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE CITY HAS

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:32.611
AND THAT IS. THE BIG COMPANIES

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:33.912
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.480
IS WHAT THAT HIGH LIMIT IS SO

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:37.816
AND I'M OPEN AND I WANT

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.684
EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT. IT'S

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.788
UNKNOWN WHAT'S CINDY WAS FOR ME

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:44.756
AS FAR AS THE CODE ENFORCEMENT

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.625
AS FAR AS THE CODE ENFORCEMENT

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.760
AS WE YOU KNOW WE GET YOU KNOW

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:49.561
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THE BUILDING

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:51.129
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE BUILDING

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:52.597
OFFICIALS NO WE DON'T WANT. WHEN

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:54.733
WE CHANGE THE DEFINITION FROM

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.735
SECOND UNITS TO EIGHTY USE BACK

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:59.004
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE REASON WHY

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.372
SHE SAID ALL THE CITIES IN THE

00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:01.973
STATE PASSED SECOND UNIT ROB

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.875
RIGHT WAS THAT SENATOR HE WAS IN

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.477
THE SETTLEMENT OF TIME PASS A

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.479
BILL SAID ALL THE CITIES HAVE TO

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:09.314
DO A SECONDARY UNITS AND WHEN I

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:11.683
GOT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.318
THERE WERE. LIKE FIVE SECONDARY

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:14.452
UNITS THAT WERE BEING BUILT

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:16.555
STATE IT WAS A IT WAS IT THE

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:18.523
FACT AWAY TO HAVE NO MOTHER IN

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.524
LAW UNITS BUILT LIST YOU'RE RICH

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:21.993
YOU LIVED ON THE HILL AND WHO

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.762
CARES IF YOU JUST THIS PAPER SO

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.764
THIS WHOLE. TRYING TO BILLS IN

00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:27.499
THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN TO TRY

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:28.967
TO TRY TO DO THAT SO THE

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.836
QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.704
THE BOOTLEG UNITS AND AGAIN WE

00:24:32.771 --> 00:24:37.175
PUT HEALTH AND SAFETY IN THERE.

00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:38.810
BECAUSE IF SOMEBODY IS. FIVE

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:40.278
PEOPLE LIVE IN A IN IN THE

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.314
GARAGE AND ALL THAT STUFF THAT'S

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:42.948
ILLEGAL THAT'S DONE. I'VE WE

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.382
DON'T HAVE ANY TOLERANCE FOR

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:46.318
THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE A UNIT.

00:24:46.384 --> 00:24:48.787
THAT YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH. THE

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.522
BUILDING PERMIT BUT YOU BUILD UP

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.457
TO CODE AT THE TIME. AND IT'S

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:53.892
CONTINUED TO BE HEALTHY IT'S NO

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.560
DIFFERENT FROM THE MOTHER HOUSE

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.762
IT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WE WANT

00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:00.432
TO. WE WANT TO GIVE DIRECTION TO

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:01.499
THE BUILDING AUTHORITIES THAT

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:03.335
HAVE THE DISCRETION TO SIGN OFF

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.136
ON THIS WE DON'T WANT. PEOPLE TO

00:25:05.203 --> 00:25:07.138
STAY IN THE DARKNESS AND NOT DO

00:25:07.205 --> 00:25:09.074
IT AND THAT. AND THAT PROVISION

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.375
HAD A FIVE YEAR LIMITATION SO

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:13.712
WE'VE LOST TWO YEARS WE- RIVER

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.847
NOBODY HAS. THE CAN'T GET A

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:17.782
BUILDING OFFICIAL OUT I'M BRAND

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.551
NEW BUILDING IT'S HARD TO GET.

00:25:19.618 --> 00:25:22.921
OFFICIALS THERE SO WE SO WE'RE

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:23.521
THINKING THAT THAT'S THAT'S-

00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:25.790

UNIT AND TRYING TO GIVE A CARE

IF IT'S SMALLER AND HORRIBLE.

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.475
THAT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.176

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:38.910
THAT. CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE A

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:40.011
SECOND FLOOR TO PUT AN EIGHTY

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:42.280
YOU OVER THE GARAGE FOR INSTANCE

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.414
AND WHICH SHOULD BE NEW

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.316
CONSTRUCTION- THAT WOULD GO IN

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:47.919
AND AS YOU'VE HEARD WE WANT A

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:48.953
HARMONIZED AT WHAT WHAT THE CITY

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.655
ORDINANCE ARE ON ON HIGH

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:53.391

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:56.761
IN OR OPT OUT OF PROGRAM. IT IF

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:59.597
THE IF THIS UNIT ALREADY HAS THE

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:02.133
SECOND STORY AND THEY WANT TO

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.701
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE ATTACHED

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:05.170
AND DETACHED IF IT ALREADY HAS

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:07.438
THE SECOND STORY YOU CAN. CUT UP

YOUR HOUSE. HOUSE PROBABLY NOT

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.808
THE MOST ELEGANT THE CHANGE YOUR

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.510
HOUSE SO THAT THAT SECOND STORY

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.412
BECOMES TECHNICALLY A SECOND IT

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.680
BECOMES AN EIGHTY YEAR THAT'S

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:17.382
ALLOWABLE THAT'S ALLOWABLE NOW.

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:19.450
UNDER UNDER THE LAW AND THIS

00:30:19.517 --> 00:30:22.320
WOULD ALLOW A BACKYARD COTTAGE

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:24.789
IF THE TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE OR

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.324
SOME VARIATION COMMENT TO HAVE A

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.760
SECOND UNIT THERE- I DON'T LIVE

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:30.261
IN THE COMMUTER MAY I HAVE A

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.429
COMMUTE A LITTLE BIT OF MY

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.331
COMMUNITY HAS. DETACHED GARAGE

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:34.399
FOR A LOT OF I KNOW LOS ANGELES

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.734
HAS A LOT OF DETACHED GARAGES IN

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:37.802
THE BACKYARD VERY POPULAR FOR

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:39.671
PEOPLE COMMENDED JUST. GOT THEM

00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:41.506
AND THEN MAKE THEM INTO EIGHTY

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.675
USE THIS WILL ALLOW THEM. AT A

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:45.677
PRICE THE BILL THE SECOND THE

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:47.412
BILL THE SECOND STORY AS LONG AS

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:48.947
THEY- YOU KNOW THEY WE HAVE A-

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:51.216
NEW IMPACT FEE FOR SEVEN HUNDRED

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.450
FIFTY FEET SO THAT SEEMS TO BE

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:54.452
THAT. THE HARDLINE. YOU KNOW I

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.987
MEAN IF YOU WANT TO GO BIGGER

00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:58.289
YOU PAY YOU PAY SO IT WOULD BE-

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.557
WITH THE LOOSENING IT WOULD IT

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:01.926
WOULD. I THINK THAT'S HOW IT

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.761
AFFECTED ON THE GROUND. AND THEN

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.296
THE OTHER QUESTION THAT THAT I

00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.732
HAVE FOR YOU IS- WOULD YOU MIND

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:10.568
EXPANDING OR EXPLAINING- TO OUR

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:13.037
AUDIENCE. HOW THIS AFFECTS OUR

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:15.707
DOES NOT AFFECT HOAS YEAH THE

00:31:15.773 --> 00:31:17.275
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION I'VE HAD

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:18.476
SOME FIGHTS WITH HOMEOWNER

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:19.544
ASSOCIATIONS ARE DIFFERENT BILLS

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.646
ON THIS BILL WE DON'T TOUCH THEM

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.681
BECAUSE I THINK. THE HOMEOWNER

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:24.949
WHO BUYS IN A HOMEOWNER

00:31:25.016 --> 00:31:26.718
ASSOCIATION SIGNED SIX

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.486
CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS AND IF

00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:29.921
THOSE CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.956
SAY THAT YOU CAN'T BUILD. AN

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:33.791
EIGHTY YEAR YOU CAN'T FILL THE

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.360
SECOND FLOOR YOU WERE TO THAT.

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.862
ALL THOSE OF US IN REGULAR

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:41.032
SUBURBIA WERE. SITTING COUNTY

00:31:41.099 --> 00:31:42.867
SOMEWHERE- THEY THAT THEY DON'T

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:44.569
HAVE THOSE RESTRICTIONS AND THE

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.070
CITY'S ALLOW THAT CONSTRUCTION

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:48.072
THEN THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:53.811
WITH. THAT BUT THIS THESE. S. B.

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:54.345
EIGHT NINE SEVEN WOULD NOT

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:55.513
CHANGE. AT ALL THE CONDITIONS

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.682
WITH EIGHTY EIGHT- M. H. WAYS TO

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:00.952
FROM BEING CONSTRUCTED

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.420
CONSTRUCTED IN THOSE AREAS IT

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.389
JUST REMAINS THE SAME IT. THERE

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.324
IS ANOTHER BILL I THINK-

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:07.191
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN HAD THE

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:09.193
BILL THAT INVITED EIGHTY EIGHT.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.762
H. WAYS TO CONSIDER WHETHER THEY

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.530
WANT TO VOTE AS A BODY TO ALLOW

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:14.332
THEM BUT THAT'S UP TO THEM. NOT

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.634
THAT THE STATE AND THIS

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:17.935
LEGISLATION DOES NOT CHANGE THAT

00:32:18.002 --> 00:32:23.408
. THANK YOU OKAY. ON ANY OTHER-

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:24.942

BEFORE THAT VARY ON DETAILED

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:33.518
DESCRIPTION I WILL SAY I LIVE IN

00:32:33.584 --> 00:32:35.520
AN H. AWAY WITH QUITE LIMITED

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:36.954
AND WE DID HAVE TO TRANSHIPPED

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.423
TO GET A GARAGE BUT IT'S NO BIG

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.191
DEAL OKAY SO PEOPLE ARE MAKING

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:42.427
OUT IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.729
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.998
THAT- BUT IT IS CONCERNING WHEN

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:49.300
MY ANALYSIS OF THAT THE CCN

00:32:49.367 --> 00:32:52.103
OURS. ARE FOR HOAS ARE OVER

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.005
RULED AND IF THAT'S NOT ACCURATE

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.340
I WANT THAT ON THE RECORD

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:59.644
BECAUSE SENATOR- ARE PROTIUM AND

00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.946
ARE GOOD CHAIR HERE BOTH AGREED

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:03.381
WHEN THEY HAVE THE ADDITIONAL

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:05.983
THAT- CC IN OURS IN TERMS OF

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.220
HOAS FOR ANY ADDITIONAL- MULTI

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.788
FAMILY AND SINGLE FAMILY ZONING

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.690
WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE SO I'M

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:14.292
NOT SURE THAT MIGHT BE AN ERROR

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.494
IN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE YOU ON

00:33:16.561 --> 00:33:18.429
THE RECORD SAYING THAT IS. IT'S

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.330
AT LEAST COMFORTING BUT I'M NOT

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:20.365
GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.467
TODAY UNTIL WE SEE WHERE YOU GO

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:23.568
WITH SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES

00:33:23.634 --> 00:33:25.970
FOR THE RECORD KNOWING THAT

THE H. AWAY AND THAT'S THAT'S A

00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:35.613
THAT'S AN ERROR ON THE TRADING

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.615
OUT FOR GARAGE WE DID AND WE GOT

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:38.850

RESTRICTIONS IN OUR H. AWAY AND

00:33:43.388 --> 00:33:44.455
LESSER THINGS I THINK ARE VERY

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:47.225

SECOND UNIT IN. AND WANTED IT TO

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.810
BE. A TWO STORIES IN ORDER TO

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.146
PRESERVE MORE AT THE YARD FOR

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.948
THAT NOT ONLY THE NEW RESIDENTS

00:36:57.014 --> 00:36:58.382
AND NEED YOU BUT THE EXISTING

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:00.685
RESIDENTS. AND VARIOUS NEIGHBORS

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:03.888
FOUGHT ARE BASICALLY ARGUING YOU

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.223
KNOW SHADE PROBLEMS BUT THEN

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.692
ONCE THEY DID THE SHADE STUDY

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.794
ONCE THEY PUT THE POLES OF

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.595
EVERYTHING THEY FOUND THAT NO IT

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.964
DIDN'T CREATE. IN FACT IT WOULD

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.532
HAVE A BETTER YOU KNOW BETTER

00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:16.534
IMPACT ON THE DIFFERENT LOT

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.070
AROUND IT AS A TWO STORY BEING

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.872
NARROWER. NO MORE CONTENT THEN

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:25.076
IF THEY THEN THE PLAN IF IT WERE

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:27.645
YOU KNOW THE SQUARE FEET ALL IN

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.947
ONE STORY. AND ANYWAY WAS JUST

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:31.949
AN INTERESTING THIS WAS MORE

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.551
THAN TEN YEARS AGO IT WAS JUST

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.720
AN INTERESTING NO DEBATE THAT

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.722
WAS GOING ON AROUND AND PEOPLE

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:40.925
ASSERT IMPACTS. JUST BECAUSE WE

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:43.227
ASSUME WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING SO

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:46.130
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:48.065
PROPOSING IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:51.369
I ALSO THINK THAT WE THAT WHILE

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:53.371
YES MANY RESIDENTS COMPLAIN

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:55.539
ABOUT PARKING. THE REQUIREMENTS

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:57.908
OF PARKING HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

00:37:57.975 --> 00:37:59.276
MAIN REASONS WE CANNOT BESIDES

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.178
ALL OF OUR ZONING RESTRICTIONS

00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:02.179
OTHER ZONING RESTRICTIONS AND

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:04.315
SUCH IT'S ONE OF THE MAIN

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.616
REASONS THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:06.917
TO ACCOMPLISH THE AMOUNT OF

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.419
HOUSING THAT WE NEED IN

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:09.854
CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THAT

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.589
YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:12.690
DIRECTION I SUPPORT THE BILL IF

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:17.828
IT HASN'T. BEEN MOVED ALREADY ON

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.430
THE- GREAT I THINK EVER MEMBER

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:20.631
OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE EXCEPT

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.867
CABALLERO GOING TO ONE TO SAY.

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.402

FOR WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:33.644
HEARING I WAS IN AND THAT THE

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:36.247
COMMITTEE. BUT I JUST THAT THIS

00:38:36.313 --> 00:38:38.215
THIS- THIS BILL. I'VE HAD A

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.350
NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.218
CENTER RIGHT HOUSE KEY ON IT

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.586
AND- IT WILL COME TO GOVERNOR

00:38:42.653 --> 00:38:44.255
GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE.

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:48.926
AFTERWARDS BUT AND SO- MY

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.761
COMMENTS ARE JUST REALLY

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.830
CONSISTENT WITH THE CONCERNS I

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.465
HAVE AND THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.434
IN THE M. IN THE COMMITTEE IS

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.304
THAT- I WHILE I AGREE WITH THAT

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.039
WITH A SENATOR SKINNER SAID.

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:04.108
SAID ABOUT IT CAN'T MIGHT BE

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.077
APPROPRIATE OR DEPENDING ON THE

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:07.178
CONFIGURATION OF THE I THINK THE

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:09.113
CHALLENGE HERE IS. DOES IT.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.815
DOESN'T WORK IN A IN A AND EVERY

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:14.819
COMMUNITY AND- AND I HAVE SOME

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:15.886
REAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT TWO

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.856
STORY. AND IF THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.958
ARE WE GOING TO BE ALLOWING.

00:39:21.025 --> 00:39:22.560
MORE UNITS THIS IS ABOUT WHAT

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:24.495
THE UNITS WILL LOOK LIKE AND HOW

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:26.263
IT WILL IMPACT. NEIGHBORS IN THE

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:30.401
NEIGHBORHOODS AND- SO I THINK

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.036
THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.471
ALREADY. THROUGH THEIR ORDINANCE

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:38.209
ALLOW. EIGHTY USED TO GO UP TO

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:41.011
TWO STORY- AND SO I'M NOT SURE

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:43.080
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.648
BILL THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO ALLOW

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:46.517
IT BY RIGHT AND THAT'S REALLY

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:49.186
WHERE I'M OUT OF THE PARKING AND

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:50.421
ALL THAT IF YOU. I'M OKAY WITH

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:52.523
BUT- BUT THE- IT'S A SAID IT'S

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.992
THE TWO STORIES AND IN MANY

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.762
COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE SITE

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.363
VIEWS THAT ARE PROTECTED VIEW

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.098
SHEDS THAT ARE PROTECTED THIS

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.200
BECOMES A PROBLEM AS WELL. AND

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.870
I'M- SO WE'LL BE LOOKING AT THIS

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:08.139
IN IN IN THE SECOND COMMITTEE

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.641

FORCED TO PUT A TWO EXCLUSIONS

MOVE AWAY FROM SOME OF THESE

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:53.137
RESTRICTIONS. ON UNDERSTANDING

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:54.438
THE BIG PICTURE HERE I

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.240
UNDERSTAND I LIVE IN A

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:56.807
NEIGHBORHOOD TO MY NEIGHBORS

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.343

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.644
HAVE A ROOM AS OPINIONS WITH A

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.513
NEIGHBOR WE ALL OF OUR

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:03.580
NEIGHBORHOODS- BUT WE DO HAVE

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.349
THIS MULTI MILLION HOME

00:43:05.416 --> 00:43:08.218
SHORTAGE. THAT IS THAT IS WORSE

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:10.721
NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE C THAT

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.690
IN TERMS OF THE COST OF HOUSING.

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:14.758
WE SEE A SPIKE IN INFECTIONS OF

00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:16.527
LOW INCOME RENTERS. YOU KNOW

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:18.295
LET'S LOOK AT THE LOW INCOME

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:19.763
RENTERS WHO CONTINUED TO BECOME

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.000
HOMELESS WAVE AFTER WAVE OF LOW

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.269
INCOME RENTERS WHOSE OUR

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:27.171
HOUSING. AND BECOME HOMELESS AND

00:43:27.237 --> 00:43:28.939
IF WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES WITH

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.407
EIGHTY USE TO CREATE MORE

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:32.343
HOUSING A MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:34.278
PEOPLE. AND IF WE HAVE A TWO

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:37.848
STORY. EIGHTY YOU. TRANSLATE TO

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.617
UNITS INSTEAD OF ONE- YEAH OR

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:43.153
HAS MORE SPACE FOR A FAMILY

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.555
THAT'S A GOOD THING AND SO WE

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.390
SHOULD ALLOW THIS KIND OF

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.459
FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY I

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:49.860
SUPPORT THIS BILL. I UNDERSTAND

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.762
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HEIGHTS

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.897
I'D CONSIDERED SUGGESTING AN

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:54.732
AMENDMENT TO SAY THAT YOU CAN'T

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.767
GO ABOVE WHATEVER THE

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.669
SURROUNDING HEIGHT LIMIT IS IF.

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:04.208
IF A CITY HAS A THIRTY FOOT.

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.509
HEIGHT LIMIT FOR SINGLE FAMILY

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:06.677
HOMES. A FIVE HIGH FOOT HIGH

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.612
LIMIT. FOR EIGHTY YOU STRIKES AS

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:09.646
REASONABLE. THE LOCAL

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:10.280
COMMUNITIES ALREADY MADE THAT

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:14.351
DETERMINATION- BUT DOT- I THINK

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.220
WE WOULD LIKE FOR US TO DEAL

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.555
WITH THAT ALL TOGETHER- AND

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:20.057
THAT'S WHY I LOOK FORWARD TO THE

TYPHUS OUTBREAKS AND THAT WAS

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:19.495
BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE MANAGER. DID NOT KNOW

COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ANY

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:53.415
LIKE CAL SKI YEAH MISTER CHAIR

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:56.585
OF ON PAGE. SIX OF OUR REPORT AS

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:58.654
WE TALK ABOUT THIS IDEA OF

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.055
EIGHTEEN HOURS FOUR HOURS WHAT

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:03.225
STATES DO THE TALK ABOUT THE TV

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:04.793
NOW PROVIDES OCCUPATIONAL

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.795
LICENSES JUST WITH THE BUSINESS

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.797
TRANSACTION POR PART. BUT IT

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.899
SUGGESTS THAT MOVING FORWARD YOU

01:16:10.966 --> 01:16:12.801
MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER MODELING

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:15.037
PARTS OF THE TRAINING. OFFER THE

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:17.072
OTHER STATES PROGRAMS INCLUDING

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.774
THE NUMBER OF HOURS TO STANDARDS

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.842
AND ALL THAT SO MY QUESTION IS

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.511
THAT IF YOU RUN AN APARTMENT

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:25.113
COMPLEX. IN YOUR A SITE MANAGER

01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:26.615
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.550
HOURS OF TRAINING DAY TO AND

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:29.785
WHAT'S THAT CONTINUING

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.386
EDUCATION. THAT IS A GREAT

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:32.821
SERVER RIGHT KELSEY I HAVE NO

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.623
IDEA I'M THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.024
COMMITTEE ON MOBILE MANUFACTURED

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.427
HOMES- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:41.263
IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES- SO I

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:42.965
DON'T KNOW OKAY JUST BECAUSE

01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.700
THEY SORT OF DO THE SAME THING

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.368
OF MANAGE THERE MAY BE A

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.636
DIFFERENT. AREA OF LAW BUT SORT

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:52.441
OF WHAT THE WHAT THE WORLD IS-

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.142
THIS IDEA. WHEN THE FEDERAL

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:55.077
GOVERNMENT CHANGE THE BANKRUPTCY

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.012
LAWS YOU HAD TO DO COUNSELING A

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.680
LOT OF SMALL INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.315
DID EDUCATION COUNSELING

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:01.583
FINANCIAL COUNSELING THE WORK TO

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:02.818
GET THEIR DISCHARGE IN

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:04.486
BANKRUPTCY. THE COURTS ALLOWED

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:05.854
PRIVATE ENTITIES- THERE'S A

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.990
BATCH OF THEM THAT DO WITH THAT

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:10.092
THAT. THEY SET THE STANDARDS IN

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:12.260
IN THESE OTHER FOLKS DO IT. THIS

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:13.996
BILL SAYS EVERYTHING'S IN HOUSE

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.365
WITH EIGHT C. D. ALTHOUGH OTHER

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.100
STATES DO THAT DO YOU SEE ANY

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:22.371
BENEFIT OF ALLOWING. INDEPENDENT

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.972
EDUCATION GROUPS TO DO THIS.

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:25.774
TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION THERE

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.677
COULD BE- WE CHOSE H. CD BECAUSE

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.545
IT'S THIS IS A CALIFORNIA LAW

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.547
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT- HAVE

01:17:32.614 --> 01:17:34.483
DIRECT OVERSIGHT OF THE MOBILE

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.451
HOME PARKS SO IT SEEMS THAT THEY

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.519
WOULD BE THE ONES THAT KNOW

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:39.488
WHAT'S HAPPENING. I WOULD BE THE

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:40.555
RIGHT ENTITIES TO BE IN CHARGE

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.691
OF THIS COULD A PRIVATE ENTITY

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.826
DO IT. POSSIBLY I KNOW I'M

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.094
ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT CREATING

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.263
LITTLE COTTAGE INDUSTRIES WERE

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.965
THEY MIGHT POP UP IN CHARGE A

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:52.000
DIFFERENT AMOUNT- THEY MAY NOT

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:54.803
BE- THEY MAY NOT BE IN TUNE TO

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.005
WHAT HCD IS DOING EXACTLY. SO I

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.907
THINK A CD IS THE APPROPRIATE

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.409
ORGANIZATION OR DON'T I MEAN

01:18:00.475 --> 01:18:02.177
THEY THEY WOULD. SET THE

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:03.111
STANDARDS AND WHAT THE HELL

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:05.647
CANNOT BE BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:07.816
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE LANGUAGE

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:10.118
ISSUE SOME PEOPLE ARE. PHYSICAL

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:11.987
LEARNERS ARE VISUAL LEARNERS

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:13.388
VERSUS SITTING ON THE COMPUTER

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:16.892
THERE'S A WHOLE BATCH OF THE

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:17.859
PEOPLE THAT THE WINTER SO BY.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:18.527
CREATING A COTTAGE INDUSTRY

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.328
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DO THAT YOU

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:23.098
GET THAT CERTIFICATE THAT YOU

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:25.167
WANT BUT YOU RESPOND TO. WHAT

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.602
THAT MANAGER IS DOING SO THOSE

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.471
ARE JUST MY COMMENTS I KNOW THAT

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.373
YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.175

WITH FROM THE APARTMENT

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:49.825
INDUSTRY. THAT COULD ANSWER THAT

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:55.030
QUESTION THE POSSIBLE- SURE WE-

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:55.797
WE DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE BILL BUT

01:18:55.864 --> 01:18:57.466
IT IS A QUESTION I'M JUST

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:59.201
CURIOUS BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY

01:18:59.267 --> 01:19:00.902
ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.337
NOT JUST SUPER COMPARISON.

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:03.205
REPRESENTING YOUR QUESTION

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.207
BASICALLY IS WHAT I'M TRYING I'M

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.508
JUST TRYING TO GET MORE

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.610
INFORMATION AS TO THE BALANCE OF

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:09.444
THE NUMBER OF HOURS REQUIRED AS

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.980
A REAL TORE WE HAVE- A NUMBER OF

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:13.682
HOURS THAT WE HAVE TO YOU WERE

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.183
MANDATED TO. TO HAVE CONTINUED

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:17.285
EDUCATION AND I BELIEVE OURS IS

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:18.620
FORTY FIVE HOURS OUT OVER THE

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:20.956
COURSE OF FOUR YEARS SO THAT'S

01:19:21.022 --> 01:19:23.425
YOU KNOW THAT'S SO WHEN I LOOKED

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:25.460
AT WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:26.628
HOURS FOR THIS I THOUGHT

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:27.362
EIGHTEEN HOURS FOR THE FIRST

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.897
YEAR AND THEN UNSPECIFIED. MONEY

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:33.268
BUT WE FOR YOUR PERSON ANSWERS

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:34.703
LET ME JUST SAY THIS AGAIN IT'S

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.705
NOT ABOUT APARTMENT COMPLEXES

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:37.572

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.274
MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS AS A

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.143
REALTOR I BELIEVE YOU WILL

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.310
PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE MORE

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.779
TRAINING THAN A PARK MANAGER. OF

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:45.914

DON'T HAVE ANY TRAINING SO

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:53.655
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.590
MORE. THAT'S WHY THERE'S A

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.526
LITTLE BIT MORE IT THAT'S BEEN

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.561
MY EXPERIENCE MISTER GOVERNOR-

LONG HOWEVER I CAN ATTEST TO THE

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.544

STRUGGLES IS NOT ONLY GONNA BE

01:51:44.864 --> 01:51:46.499
FRIENDLY ON THE ENVIRONMENT

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:48.468

01:51:58.311 --> 01:52:02.849
LOCATIONS- IN- IN- REGARDS TO

01:52:02.916 --> 01:52:04.884
THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY SO

01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:06.786
OFTEN TIMES WHEN A CITY DOES

01:52:06.853 --> 01:52:08.421
THAT THEY DO IT WITHIN THEIR OWN

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:10.657
BOUNDARIES. BUT IN A COUNTY LIKE

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:13.159
SAN DIEGO THAT IS- SO BIG AND SO

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:15.395
DIVERSE ONE OF THE N. STREET SEE

01:52:15.462 --> 01:52:17.097
INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT SAN

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:19.499
DIEGO'S THAT HAS THE LARGEST

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:23.002
AMOUNT OF MOM AND POP FARMS. AND

01:52:23.069 --> 01:52:24.537
THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

01:52:24.604 --> 01:52:25.805
CHALLENGES AND SAN DIEGO TO

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.707
PROTECT THOSE FARMS IN THAT

01:52:27.774 --> 01:52:32.745
PRODUCTION AND THAT LAND USE

01:52:32.812 --> 01:52:33.446
FROM ENCROACHMENT OF HOUSING.

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:34.614
AND IT BECOMES HARDER IN SAN

01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:35.882
DIEGO WHEN YOU HAVE COMPETING

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:39.786
GOALS LIKE THAT. AND SO- THIS

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:42.922
BILL- I THINK WOULD BE A GREAT-

01:52:42.989 --> 01:52:45.725
SOLUTION TO HAVE SANDAG BE

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:48.128
INVOLVED IN. THE FUTURE VISION

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:49.863
IN AND THE ALLOCATION OF

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:52.765
RESOURCES. AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:56.569
THEY WORK CLOSER WITH CITIES. TO

01:52:56.636 --> 01:52:59.806
IDENTIFY. WHERE THOSE RESOURCES

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.574
ARE GOING TO BE INVESTED TO GET

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:03.510
REALLY THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.911
BUCK TO ENSURE. THAT HOUSING

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:07.514
INCREASE IS CREATE IT WHERE IT'S

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:10.350
NEEDED SO WE DON'T PUT AN OVER

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:12.085

GOT MONEY BUT THAT IS NOT THE

02:09:40.439 --> 02:09:41.273
CASE I GUARANTEE IT WE'RE GOING

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.208

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:13.739
WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE. KIND OF

02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:14.740
REVERSE ENGINEERED. HOW TO GET

02:10:14.806 --> 02:10:16.341

MAKE IT WORK SO BASICALLY THE

02:10:28.487 --> 02:10:30.422
IDEA IS THIS AND THERE'S SOME

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:32.257
CHALLENGES AND- I WANT TO. JUST

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:32.824
FOR THE RECORD MAKE SURE WE

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:33.592

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:39.131
BE DONE WE DON'T WITH THE

02:10:39.198 --> 02:10:40.199
FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK. BUT AS I

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:41.433
SUGGESTED YOU CHAIRED TO THE

02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.501
CHAIR OF THAT. THEY HOUSING

02:10:42.568 --> 02:10:44.603
COMMITTEE THE OTHER HOUSE WE CAN

HELP. WITH YOUR HELP. SO THERE'S

02:10:45.537 --> 02:10:47.439
MORE WORK TO BE DONE. BUT THE

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:48.407
BASIC FRAMEWORK IS HERE. SO WHAT

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:50.275
HAPPENS WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT

02:10:50.342 --> 02:10:52.344
AND- PUT ON THE BALLOT WITH A

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.979
TWO THIRDS VOTE. THE TWENTY FIVE

02:10:54.046 --> 02:10:55.214
BILLION DOLLAR BOND ISSUE. THAT

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.448
BOND ISSUES GOING TO HAVE TWO

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:58.183
COMPONENTS TO IT. THE FIRST IS

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:58.984
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WITH

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:00.252
YOUR AMENDMENTS. WHICH IS GOING

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:01.920
TO GO FOR DOWN PAYMENT

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:02.521
ASSISTANCE AND THE OTHER SEVEN

02:11:02.588 --> 02:11:04.756
BILLION IS GOING TO BE TO. HELP

02:11:04.823 --> 02:11:06.191
IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BE

02:11:06.258 --> 02:11:08.026
ABLE TO PAY FOR OFF SITE.

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.027
IMPROVEMENTS WHY IS THAT

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:10.429
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE LOTS OF

02:11:10.495 --> 02:11:11.697
TENSION PEOPLE DEVELOPERS GO TO

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:13.865
DEVELOP. THAT THERE'S THEY DON'T

02:11:13.932 --> 02:11:14.266
HAVE SIDEWALKS OR

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:15.400
INFRASTRUCTURES YOU NEED TO

02:11:15.467 --> 02:11:16.969
FIGURE OUT A FINANCIAL MECHANISM

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:17.936
WE USE THAT FINANCIAL MECHANISM

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:19.972
OVER THE YEARS. IN BELARUS OTHER

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:21.673
THINGS BUT WE NEED A FINANCIAL

02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:24.109
MECHANISM HERE. SECOND THE IDEA

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:25.844
BEHIND THE BONDISSUE IS NOT TO

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:27.312
HAVE THE STATE PAY LIKE REDUCE.

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:29.114
WITH PART BONDS OR HAVE THE

02:11:29.181 --> 02:11:30.616
STATE PAY LIKE REDUCE HOUSING

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:31.583
WITH WITH WITH SCHOOL

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:33.518
CONSTRUCTION. THE IDEA HERE IT'S

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:34.419
CALLED WHAT'S CALLED THE SELF

02:11:34.486 --> 02:11:36.221
LIQUIDATING BOND. SO WHY WE

02:11:36.288 --> 02:11:37.789
DOING A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:39.291
WITH THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT.

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.993
WELL EUROPE UPWARD PRESSURE

02:11:41.059 --> 02:11:42.628
BECAUSE OF INFLATION UPWARD

02:11:42.694 --> 02:11:44.463
PRESSURE BECAUSE OF COSTS. YOU

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:46.164
NEED TO FIND PLACES YOU CAN SAVE

02:11:46.231 --> 02:11:47.432
MONEY WHEN YOU MAKE AN ECONOMIC

02:11:47.499 --> 02:11:49.801
MODEL. IN THIS HOUSING SITUATION

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:51.169
IF WE CAN USE THE BORROWING

02:11:51.236 --> 02:11:52.604
POWER AND THE GUARANTEE OF THE

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:54.606
STATE. AND BASICALLY THE

02:11:54.673 --> 02:11:56.441
MORTGAGES ARE GOING TO PAY BACK

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.176
THE LOAN. THAT REDUCES INTEREST

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:59.811
COST IF YOU REDUCE INTEREST

02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:01.880
COSTS. GIVES YOU MORE LATITUDE.

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:03.915
FOR BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE TO

02:12:03.982 --> 02:12:04.516
HAVE HOMES. SO BY HAVING THE

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:05.851
FULL FAITH AND CREDIT IT'S

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:06.985
CALLED THE SELF LIQUIDATING

02:12:07.052 --> 02:12:09.187
BOND. AND SO THEY'LL BE A LITTLE

02:12:09.254 --> 02:12:14.259
BIT THE INTERESTED WE CAN CHARGE

02:12:14.326 --> 02:12:14.826
WILL BE LOT SMALLER ON THE

02:12:14.893 --> 02:12:16.228
SECOND TRY STAY. ARE HERE'S

02:12:16.295 --> 02:12:17.696
BASS. HOW IT. IN THE SAME. TERMS

02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:20.632

FAITH AND CREDIT OF THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE COSTS WE'RE

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.738
PUTTING IN FOR SKILLED AND

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:41.306
TRAINED PEOPLE ARGUE IN THE

AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD IN THE

02:14:42.674 --> 02:14:44.309
RENTAL SITE WILL THAT COST MORE

02:14:44.376 --> 02:14:45.577
MONEY. WILL GOING TO CENTER

02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:47.512
CRETACEOUS POINT WE'RE NOT GOING

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:49.181
TO SUPPORT A SYSTEM THAT GETS

02:14:49.247 --> 02:14:50.248
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:51.516
WITH THEM EIGHT PEOPLE

02:14:51.583 --> 02:14:52.584
REASONABLE WAGES WITH ALL THE

02:14:52.651 --> 02:14:53.552
VARIOUS BELLS AND WHISTLES ARE

02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:54.853
NECESSARY AND WITH THAT

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:57.456
INCREASES THE COST AT THE END OF

02:14:57.522 --> 02:14:59.057
THE DAY WE'RE NOT WORRIED IT FIT

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:00.525
ROLLS INTO THE PRICE WHICH IS

02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:02.160
THEN PAID WHEN YOU DO THE

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:03.328
ECONOMICS AND WE HAVE THE

02:15:03.395 --> 02:15:05.597
ANALYSIS WHICH I CAN SHARE WITH

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:06.565
YOU WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE

02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:08.533
AND SO BASICALLY IT IS A PRETTY

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:09.801
ELEGANT WAY. TO CREATE

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.269
EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC FEEDBACK

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:13.205
AFFECT THE PROPERTY TAX IMPACTS

02:15:13.271 --> 02:15:14.973
GREAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.641
COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIRMAN

02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:18.510
RAISED WHICH I THINK APPROPRIATE

02:15:18.577 --> 02:15:20.011
IS WE'RE NOT QUITTING LEVITTOWN

02:15:20.078 --> 02:15:21.980
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PLACE

02:15:22.047 --> 02:15:23.248
WHERE WE'RE JUST WE'RE GONNA

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:24.516
HAVE COULD TAKE SOME CONTROL ON

02:15:24.583 --> 02:15:26.751
THIS FALL WILL BE A LOT OF PARTS

02:15:26.818 --> 02:15:28.753
OF THE STATE WITH US WE REALLY

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:29.688
REALLY GREAT. FIRST TIME

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:30.622
HOMEBUYERS GUESS WHAT THEY GET A

02:15:30.689 --> 02:15:33.124
NEW HOUSE WITH NEW APPLIANCES

02:15:33.191 --> 02:15:35.026
WITH NEW EVERYTHING YOU'RE NOT

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:36.361
BUYING GRANDMA'S HOUSE WITH A

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:37.729
LEAKY ROOF AND LEAKY PIPES AND

02:15:37.796 --> 02:15:39.865
ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU BOUGHT IT

02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.399
NOW YOU GOT AN EXPENSE TO FIX

02:15:41.466 --> 02:15:42.434
THE EIGHT THE HVAC SYSTEMS OR

02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:44.169
SOMETHING ELSE WE GOT A BRAND

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:46.071
NEW PLACE WITH WARRANTY PARTS

02:15:46.137 --> 02:15:47.105
AND DONE THROUGH SKILLED AND

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:49.107
TRAINED SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS

02:15:49.174 --> 02:15:51.776
THAT IT IS IT IS A WAY I THINK

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:54.145
PRETTY ELEGANTLY AS I USE THAT

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:56.314

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:57.883
GOALS AND I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED

02:15:57.949 --> 02:15:59.417
AS WE- LOOK AT ALL THE

02:15:59.484 --> 02:16:00.752
LEGISLATION THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:02.687

02:16:02.754 --> 02:16:04.256
THAT WE FACE BECAUSE OF THIS

02:16:04.322 --> 02:16:06.658
RICH POOR DIVIDE HOW DO WE

02:16:06.725 --> 02:16:08.360
CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE ALLOW

02:16:08.426 --> 02:16:10.595
PEOPLE TO BUILD WEALTH HOME IS

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:15.400
WHERE THE WEALTH. IS MOST PEOPLE

02:16:15.467 --> 02:16:16.301
HAVE WELL FOR THE WHOLE WE'VE

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:18.937
GOT A- OF THE GAME WE'VE GOT TO

02:16:26.311 --> 02:16:27.212
THING. AND IT'S A RENTAL. LEVEL

02:16:27.279 --> 02:16:28.813
GETS THE OPS. HEADED GETS THE

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:29.881

TRYING TO DO HERE. AND THE- THE

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:55.941

02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:16.801
PERCENTAGE FOR- MIXED USE WHICH

02:26:16.868 --> 02:26:18.703
I THAT'S KIND OF COOL BECAUSE

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:20.605
YOU GET AT THAT IN. TERMS OF THE

02:26:20.671 --> 02:26:21.539
YOU GET THAT FINANCED WITH

02:26:21.606 --> 02:26:22.473
COMMERCIAL SIDE BUT IT'S REALLY

02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:24.208
MODEL ON A PRIVATE SECTOR MODEL

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:25.910
IN A SENSE OKAY. BECAUSE YOU

02:26:25.977 --> 02:26:27.512
GOTTA MAKE THE RATE OF RETURN

02:26:27.578 --> 02:26:28.880
FROM INVESTORS I KNOW THE POINT

02:26:28.946 --> 02:26:31.249
STRIVERS ABOUT. ABOUT MENTAL BUT

02:26:31.315 --> 02:26:32.383
THEN THAT MEANS IF IT'S RENTAL

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:33.751
THAT MEANS TACKLE USING TAX

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:35.586
DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THIS WE GO TO

02:26:35.653 --> 02:26:38.456
THE L. A. ONLY ASK THE L. A. O.

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:40.224
TO MODEL THIS WE WANT TO SHOW

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:41.492
IT'S A LOW RISK TO TAXPAYERS

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:42.393
OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT BECAUSE

02:26:42.460 --> 02:26:43.628
THEY'RE GOING TOWARD. WITH THE

02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:46.063
WHOLE THEORIES TO MOVE AWAY FROM

02:26:46.130 --> 02:26:48.533
THAT AND MAKE IT A PRIVATE

02:26:48.599 --> 02:26:49.367
SECTOR MODEL NOW. THE PUT IT

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:51.969
WHAT WILL PROBABLY DO IS THE

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:53.504
RESULT OF HOW THE LANGUAGE OF

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:54.505
THE COMMITTEE PUT IN WHICH IS

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:55.640
IMPORTANT I GET IT. WILL

02:26:55.706 --> 02:26:57.575
PROBABLY HAVE SO A DEVELOPMENTS

02:26:57.642 --> 02:26:58.409
IF CONDOS A ROW HOUSES OR

02:26:58.476 --> 02:26:59.710
SOMETHING IN. IT AND- CENTER

02:26:59.777 --> 02:27:01.245
CARPIO'S DISTRICT AND MAYBE

02:27:01.312 --> 02:27:02.980
DEDICATE SOME OF THOSE FOR LOWER

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:04.916
PRICED. BUT THE DELTA HAS TO BE

02:27:04.982 --> 02:27:06.484
MADE UP WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:08.352
HOW TO WORK OUT THAT FINANCE OUR

02:27:08.419 --> 02:27:10.188
FINANCE PEOPLE TO TELL US.

02:27:10.254 --> 02:27:11.556
THAT'S WORKABLE. BUT IT'S NOT IN

02:27:11.622 --> 02:27:13.391
THE NORMAL CONTEXT OF. AS WAS

02:27:13.457 --> 02:27:14.759
INDICATED BY MISTER CALLAHAN THE

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:16.561
TRADITIONAL SUBSIDIZED RENTAL

02:27:16.627 --> 02:27:18.162
MARKET. THIS IS THE MISSING

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:20.064
MIDDLE IT IS THE POLICE OFFICER

02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:21.732
AND THE NURSE. AND THE AND THE

02:27:21.799 --> 02:27:23.668
WORK RATE IS THE TEACHER. WE ARE

02:27:23.734 --> 02:27:25.303
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO EVERY

02:27:25.369 --> 02:27:26.804
SINGLE DAY. ARE SPENDING EVERY

02:27:26.871 --> 02:27:28.472
NICKEL THEY HAVE TO LIVE AND

02:27:28.539 --> 02:27:30.508
THEY CAN NEVER COME UP WITH THE

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:31.742
SCRATCH. FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:27:31.809 --> 02:27:32.476
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A DOWN

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:34.412
PAYMENT FOR SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND

02:27:34.478 --> 02:27:35.446
DOLLAR HOUSE. WE'RE GONNA WRITE

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:37.348
IN THAT CHECK. THEY COME UP WITH

02:27:37.415 --> 02:27:38.282
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:40.184
AND THEY CAN GET A HOUSE. GET ON

02:27:40.251 --> 02:27:41.652
THE ROAD TO START MAKING MONEY.

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.588
AND HAVING ALL THE BENEFITS THAT

02:27:43.654 --> 02:27:44.989
WORK TO KILL ANYBODY. REALLY IS

02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:45.790
NOT. DESIGNED FOR THAT BECAUSE

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:47.692
IT'S A FINANCIAL MODEL. THE I

02:27:47.758 --> 02:27:49.460
DON'T THINK ANYTHING PRECLUDES.

02:27:49.527 --> 02:27:52.563
ONCE THE PROJECTS. WELL WE CAN

02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:54.532
DEAL WITH. YOU HAVE TO THE MODEL

02:27:54.599 --> 02:27:56.567
HAS TO BE THAT MISSING MIDDLE

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:59.437
AND WHAT. IF THE PRICE OF IT IS

02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:00.304
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY

02:28:00.371 --> 02:28:02.473
GOTTA. PUT ALONG TOGETHER FOR

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.575
SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT GETS A

02:28:04.642 --> 02:28:05.643
LOT OF PEOPLE OUT YOU KNOW. AND

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:07.979
IF IT GOES UP TO MILLION IN SOME

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:09.313
AREAS. HE GIVE A 1-005-000-0800

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.514
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THAT

02:28:10.581 --> 02:28:12.416
PUTS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT SO IT

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.652
MAY BE. PEOPLE WITH THAT WORK

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:15.419
FOR US NO THAT DISCONTENT

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:16.554
DISCONNECT DISTRACTED IT'S TRUE

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:19.056
IT'S TRUE IT'S NOT ESSENTIAL

02:28:19.123 --> 02:28:20.191
IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM. WHAT DO

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:21.792
YOUR ECONOMIST SAY ON THE

02:28:21.859 --> 02:28:24.462
FIFTEEN- YOUR BALLOON WHILE I

02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:25.896
KNOW THAT THAT GIVES US COMFORT

02:28:25.963 --> 02:28:27.932
IF I'M HOLDING. THE LOAN BUT-

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.000
TELL ME HOW THAT WORKS

02:28:29.066 --> 02:28:31.002
ECONOMICALLY BECAUSE- BECAUSE-

02:28:31.068 --> 02:28:32.703
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE

02:28:32.770 --> 02:28:33.838
SEEN THE PRICES GO UP.

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:35.373
ASTRONOMICALLY IT'S A NOTHING

02:28:35.439 --> 02:28:37.108
BURGER IT'S EASY PEOPLE GET THAT

02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:39.210
BUT I DON'T KNOW GOING FORWARD.

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:41.178
IF WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT

02:28:41.245 --> 02:28:43.347
APPRECIATION. OF THAT'S GOING TO

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:45.049
MAKE THESE REFINANCING DEALS.

02:28:45.116 --> 02:28:47.051
SIMPLE WELL TWO POINTS THE

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.452
GENERAL CASKET WHAT NUMBER ONE

02:28:48.519 --> 02:28:50.621
IS WE ANALYZE A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:28:50.688 --> 02:28:51.689
FOUR YEARS OF THE GROWTH HOUSING

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.391
IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE REASON

02:28:53.457 --> 02:28:54.458
QUITE FRANKLY. WITH ALL THESE

02:28:54.525 --> 02:28:55.593
INVESTORS ARE COMING IN BUYING

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.194
UP HOUSING EVERYWHERE BECAUSE TO

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.462
UNBELIEVABLY GOOD MODEL NUMBER

02:28:58.529 --> 02:29:00.097
ONE. NUMBER TWO IS WE'VE WRITTEN

02:29:00.164 --> 02:29:02.066
IN THE FLEXIBILITY FOR CALLAGY

02:29:02.133 --> 02:29:05.303
FAYE TO THE EXTENT CHANGE MODIFY

02:29:05.369 --> 02:29:07.104
SO BECAUSE AGAIN. WHAT ARE WE

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.906
DOING HERE EVEN IN TERMS OF

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:10.675
THESE NUMBERS IT HAS TO BE

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:12.043
BALANCED BY OUR PUBLIC POLICY

02:29:12.109 --> 02:29:14.645
IDEAS. WITH A FINANCIAL MODEL

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:17.014
THAT WORKS. BECAUSE THE REASON

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:18.649
FINANCIAL MODELS WORK ON SOME OF

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:19.950
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

02:29:20.017 --> 02:29:21.218
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT USES TAX

02:29:21.285 --> 02:29:23.220
DOLLARS. INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.022
PRESCHOOL OR FOSTER CARE

02:29:25.089 --> 02:29:26.324
WHATEVER AND THEY PAY THE

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:28.726
DIFFERENCE AND SO THIS IS A

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:30.594
PRETTY INTERESTING WAY. TO

02:29:30.661 --> 02:29:32.763
ACHIEVE THAT THAT THAT SPREAD

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.332
HOW DO YOU LIKE OKAY OUR COSTS

02:29:34.398 --> 02:29:35.700
ARE HIGHER BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING

02:29:35.766 --> 02:29:36.734
WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.536
FAIR WAGES WHAT WE'RE GONNA OVER

02:29:38.602 --> 02:29:39.737
HERE REDUCE INTEREST COSTS

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:40.771
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:42.406
STATE. FIGURES THAT WE'RE TRYING

02:29:42.473 --> 02:29:43.841
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WANT TO

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:44.742
INCENTIVIZE DEVELOPERS WITH HIS

02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:48.079
SB THIRTY FIVE WITH THE LATENT

02:29:48.145 --> 02:29:49.547
DEFECTS WITH OTHER THINGS BUT

02:29:49.613 --> 02:29:51.182
GET I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:52.850
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS.

02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:54.618
YOU IF YOU WANT THE BENEFITS OF

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.220
THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE TO BUILD

02:29:56.287 --> 02:29:57.755
UNDER THIS PROGRAM. NONE OF

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:59.457
THESE BENEFITS AND NONE OF THE

02:29:59.523 --> 02:30:00.791
MONEY GETS ACCESSIBLE TO YOU OR

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:03.094
THE BANKS THAT CALIPERS OR TO

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.296
ANYBODY UNLESS WHEN YOU START A

02:30:05.363 --> 02:30:07.565
PROJECT YOU AGREE TO. CONFORM TO

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:09.567
THIS PROGRAM YOU CAN FOR THE

02:30:09.633 --> 02:30:15.506
PROGRAM. NOW. SOMEBODY GOES TO A

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:17.174
LOCAL BANK. THEY IN THEIR SEVEN

02:30:17.241 --> 02:30:18.309
DOLLARS SEVEN DOT FIVE ZERO. AND

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:19.377
THEIR CREDIT REPORT AND WHATEVER

02:30:19.443 --> 02:30:20.544
THEIR NUMBERS ARE. AND THEY GET

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:22.380
A HOUSE YEAH AND THEN THEY CAN

02:30:22.446 --> 02:30:23.781
SELL IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE

02:30:23.848 --> 02:30:25.316
AFTERWARDS WENT OUT OF THE

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:26.784
SYSTEM. BOTH ITS REVOLVING IT

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:29.019
CREATES ABOUT WE THINK ABOUT A

02:30:29.086 --> 02:30:29.653
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND HOUSES

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:30.988
WHAT WE BEST ESTIMATE. AND WE

02:30:31.055 --> 02:30:32.623
SAY FOR EVERY MILLION IT BILLION

02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:34.625
HALF DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND. IN

02:30:34.692 --> 02:30:36.627
THIS DEVELOP AND WE GET TO A ONE

02:30:36.694 --> 02:30:38.262
BILLION AT ONE ELEVEN BILLION

02:30:38.329 --> 02:30:38.929
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:30:38.996 --> 02:30:40.431
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE LOAN THE

02:30:40.498 --> 02:30:42.233
PROPERTY TAX INCREASES LEVEL OF

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:44.034
THE OTHER ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THE

02:30:44.101 --> 02:30:45.403
END LET ALONE ALL THE IN INCOME

02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:47.138
TAX AND STUFF THAT HAPPENS

02:30:47.204 --> 02:30:48.205
RESULT OF THE BUILDING. BUT IS

02:30:48.272 --> 02:30:49.840
AN EXTRAORDINARY ECONOMIC MODEL

02:30:49.907 --> 02:30:51.675
I JUST WANNA TELL YOU. THAT THIS

02:30:51.742 --> 02:30:53.911
IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:54.545
BUILDING HOUSES BUT SOME YEARS

02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:56.480
AGO WE DID A NUMBER OF SCHOOL

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.349
BONDS. AND WHEN YOU TALK TO THE

02:30:58.416 --> 02:30:59.650
FOLKS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES

02:30:59.717 --> 02:31:01.318
THEY SAID THAT THEY SAVE THEM

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:03.320
WHEN WE GOT TO THE DOWNTURN TWO

02:31:03.387 --> 02:31:04.221
THOUSAND EIGHT. BUILDING ALL

02:31:04.288 --> 02:31:05.389
THOSE SCHOOLS WAS ABLE TO KEEP

02:31:05.456 --> 02:31:07.425
MONEY IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:08.426
PEOPLE COULD STILL WORK. AND WE

02:31:08.492 --> 02:31:11.362
DID THAT SO THIS TO ME IT HAS A

02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:13.631
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BENEFITS- BY

02:31:13.697 --> 02:31:15.299
THE COR. GIVING PEOPLE AN

02:31:15.366 --> 02:31:16.600

LIKE THAT SO IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE

02:31:30.848 --> 02:31:35.352
HAVE A LOT OF SPACE TO BUILD

02:31:35.419 --> 02:31:37.087

02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:40.985
CLARIFY YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE A

02:32:41.051 --> 02:32:45.422

WORKFORCE VERSIONS DON'T MANDATE

02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:58.969
UNION MANDATES THE WAGE LEVEL

02:32:59.036 --> 02:33:00.604
AND THE MANDATES THAT A CERTAIN

02:33:00.671 --> 02:33:01.639
PERCENTAGE OF THE WORKERS HAVE

02:33:01.705 --> 02:33:03.173
TO COME OUT OF A START STATE

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:04.742
CERTIFIED APPRENTICESHIP

02:33:04.808 --> 02:33:07.845
PROGRAM- AND THAT CAN BE UNION

02:33:07.912 --> 02:33:09.847
OR NONUNION AND PRACTICE IT WILL

02:33:09.914 --> 02:33:11.949
TEND TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE A

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.517
UNION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE

02:33:13.584 --> 02:33:16.053
LAW REQUIRES OKAY SO JUST MAKING

02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:18.789
SURE SO- FOR THE BIDDING PROCESS

02:33:18.856 --> 02:33:21.225
FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT DOES

02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:22.960
THAT INCLUDE ANYONE THAT IS NOT.

02:33:23.027 --> 02:33:28.232
CONSIDERED A LABOR. AB COMPANY A

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:29.533
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY TO BE ABLE

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:31.602
TO BID ON THIS JOB AND THE

02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.270
REASON I ASK IS THAT I WANT TO

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:35.439
MAKE SURE THERE WAS A COMMON IN

02:33:35.506 --> 02:33:36.607
THE PREVIOUS SPELL THAT. WE ARE

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:38.742
VERY LIMITED I'M NOT SURE IF IT

02:33:38.809 --> 02:33:40.144
WAS ON FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY

02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:41.845
BUT- COMMITTEE OR I CAN MEET

CALIFORNIA THEY CAN CONSTRUCT.

02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:48.385
AND SO WHAT THAT DOES IS IF YOU

02:33:48.452 --> 02:33:50.754
LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:33:50.821 --> 02:33:52.423

CORRECTED ONE OF THE THING THAT

02:36:03.654 --> 02:36:05.823
THINKS IMPORTANT. YOU MIGHT MY

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:07.825
VIEW. IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO

SOLVE A PROBLEM WHICH IS THE

02:36:10.027 --> 02:36:10.794
SAME REASON OF SAYING- BUT JUST

02:36:10.861 --> 02:36:13.063
GO GET PRODUCTION EACH I TRY TO

02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:15.165
DO A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS IN A

02:36:15.232 --> 02:36:16.400
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:17.701
WE'RE ECONOMIC REPORTS GOING TO

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:19.103
SHOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S THE

02:36:19.169 --> 02:36:20.971
HIGHEST RENTS IN THE NATION OKAY

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:22.573
THE AVERAGE WAGES STATEWIDE IN

TO AFFORD AN AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM

02:36:29.747 --> 02:36:32.349
PLACE SO THE IDEA IS IT WOULD BE

02:36:32.416 --> 02:36:34.451
HOLY AND JUST TO BE IN A

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:35.853
SITUATION WHERE YOUR BILL THE

02:36:35.919 --> 02:36:38.489
HOUSE FOR SOMEONE SAY WHO IS A

02:36:38.555 --> 02:36:40.557
TEACHER OR A FIREFIGHTER OR

02:36:40.624 --> 02:36:41.558
WHATEVER. TO GO AND THAT THE

02:36:41.625 --> 02:36:43.127
HOUSE BUT THE WORKER COULDN'T

02:36:43.193 --> 02:36:44.361
SUPPORT SO IT REALLY IS A

02:36:44.428 --> 02:36:46.663
HOLISTIC VIEW IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.232
YOU SAW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:50.234
UNION BUT IT HAS TO BE PEOPLE

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:52.102
TRADE. AND THE OTHER PART OF THE

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:53.403
SKILLED AND TRAINED PIECE IS THE

02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:55.439
QUALITY OF THE WORK. OFF ON YOU

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:57.207
KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE

02:36:57.274 --> 02:36:59.042
HAVE A TEN YEAR LAKE DEFECT LAW

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:00.277
IS BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF THE

02:37:00.344 --> 02:37:02.379
WORK OF WE'RE NOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:03.380

SITUATIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

02:37:11.755 --> 02:37:13.590
OVER THE TIME SO I JUST THINK

02:37:13.657 --> 02:37:14.725
IT'S REALLY KIND OF IN A

02:37:14.792 --> 02:37:15.726
SITUATION AS TO HOW WE'RE

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:17.394
DEALING WITH THIS OFFER THAT I'M

02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:19.596
I'M JUST A- WE WISH BUT WE WILL

02:37:19.663 --> 02:37:20.998
LITERALLY MEET EVERY FRIDAY

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.432
MORNING IN THE SPENDING. SHORT

02:37:22.499 --> 02:37:23.367
AMOUNT OF TIME TRYING TO THINK

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:25.202
IT THROUGH IN A NON POLITICAL

02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:27.538
WAY TO A BUT BY THE WAY THAT

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.506
SAYS HOW DO YOU SOLVE THESE

02:37:29.573 --> 02:37:30.874
MAJOR PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE

02:37:30.941 --> 02:37:31.909
DEALING WITH. IN CALIFORNIA GIVE

02:37:31.975 --> 02:37:33.610
OPPORTUNITY REALLY TO THE MIDDLE

02:37:33.677 --> 02:37:34.812
AND LOWER MIDDLE AND TERMS WITH

02:37:34.878 --> 02:37:40.017
THOSE. NUMBERS ULTIMATELY ARE

02:37:40.083 --> 02:37:41.618
SOME PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT.

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:44.021
JEFF HAD LEFT A YOU. AS A- SO MY

02:37:44.087 --> 02:37:44.822
CONCERN IS THAT THE PREVAILING

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:47.124
AND- FINE WITH THE PRE WAGE AND-

02:37:47.191 --> 02:37:48.292
ON THAT I DO UNDERSTAND IT'S MY

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:50.127
IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:37:50.194 --> 02:37:51.428
ANYTHING THAT IS STATE FUNDED IS

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:52.663
AND QUALIFIES FOR PREVAILING

02:37:52.729 --> 02:37:54.565
WAGE THAT IS NOT AT ALL MY

02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:56.466
CONCERN I THINK MY CONCERN IS.

02:37:56.533 --> 02:37:59.036
MOSTLY AND I PROBABLY THE NUMBER

02:37:59.102 --> 02:38:00.804
ONE PRIORITY IS THE FACT THAT I

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:02.439
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T

02:38:02.506 --> 02:38:03.941
PUT IN STATUTE WHO CAN AND

02:38:04.007 --> 02:38:06.376
CANNOT- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:38:06.443 --> 02:38:08.278
BID ON THESE PROJECTS FOR ANY

02:38:08.345 --> 02:38:10.180
COMPANY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:38:10.247 --> 02:38:11.381
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I BELIEVE

02:38:11.448 --> 02:38:12.683
THAT. I WON I DO BELIEVE IN

02:38:12.749 --> 02:38:14.384
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK

02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:16.420
THAT IS VERY VERY POOR THAT IS

02:38:16.486 --> 02:38:18.522
THE AMERICAN DREAM AND NUMBER

02:38:18.589 --> 02:38:20.557
TWO THAT- WHEN WE WHEN WE

02:38:20.624 --> 02:38:22.259
SPECIFY THE TYPE OF LABOR THAT

02:38:22.326 --> 02:38:23.794
WE WANT OR WHO CAN AND CANNOT

02:38:23.861 --> 02:38:25.796
WORK WE REALLY DISCRIMINATING

02:38:25.863 --> 02:38:27.931
ACTUALLY. FOR THAT OF EACH AB

02:38:27.998 --> 02:38:29.566
FOR THAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

02:38:29.633 --> 02:38:31.101
AND SO THAT THAT IS MY BIGGEST

02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:33.871
BIGGEST CONCERN AND USUALLY-

02:38:33.937 --> 02:38:35.405
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN

02:38:35.472 --> 02:38:37.507
WE DO PUT THESE ARCHELAUS IN

02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:40.110
PLACE IT REALLY AT DESCENT OF

02:38:40.177 --> 02:38:41.912
ISIS PEOPLE FROM BIDDING ON THE

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:43.680
PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:44.848
THE CHANCES OF THEM GETTING

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:47.184
PICKED UP. AS THE CONTRACTOR

02:38:47.251 --> 02:38:49.219
ACTUALLY DIMINISHES THEIR

02:38:49.286 --> 02:38:50.520
OPPORTUNITY FROM ACTUALLY

02:38:50.587 --> 02:38:52.155
PURSUING THESE THESE CONTRACTS

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:55.058
AND SO THAT TO ME IS OF A

02:38:55.125 --> 02:38:56.727
CONCERN BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN.

02:38:56.793 --> 02:38:58.295
BASED ON MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS I

02:38:58.362 --> 02:39:00.631
WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL THAT THEY

02:39:00.697 --> 02:39:03.367
HAVE THE RIGHT IN THE EQUAL

02:39:03.433 --> 02:39:05.335
OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT EQUITY

02:39:05.402 --> 02:39:06.870
THIS IS EQUITABLE TALK ABOUT

02:39:06.937 --> 02:39:09.306
EQUITY. EVERYONE HAS AN EQUAL

02:39:09.373 --> 02:39:11.108
CHANCE OF GETTING THESE

02:39:11.174 --> 02:39:13.577
CONTRACTS- AND AS FAR AS THE

02:39:13.644 --> 02:39:15.245
NOTION OF SKILL AND TRAIN

02:39:15.312 --> 02:39:17.447
BECAUSE IT MAY- YOU ARE

02:39:17.514 --> 02:39:19.216
GUARANTEED A BETTER PRODUCT I

02:39:19.283 --> 02:39:23.487
BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FREE

02:39:23.553 --> 02:39:28.859
MARKET- IN PLACE. THE COM. THAT

02:39:28.926 --> 02:39:31.595
DON'T PROVIDE A QUALITY GOOD.

02:39:31.662 --> 02:39:33.630
WILL NOT BE CHOSEN OR SELECTED

02:39:33.697 --> 02:39:35.032
ON ANY OF THESE FACTORS NO

02:39:35.098 --> 02:39:36.733
MATTER HOW LOWER OR HOW HIGH THE

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.835
PRICES THEY WILL NOT BE IT THEY

02:39:38.902 --> 02:39:40.270
WILL NOT BE SELECTED BECAUSE OF

02:39:40.337 --> 02:39:43.140
THE REPUTATION THAT YOU HAVE OF

02:39:43.206 --> 02:39:46.476
NOT BEING A- QUALITY CONTRACTOR

02:39:46.543 --> 02:39:47.978
OR PRODUCING A QUALITY PRODUCT

02:39:48.045 --> 02:39:50.013
SO I THINK THE NATURAL AT

02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.548
TENNESSEE WOULD BE THAT ANYONE

02:39:51.615 --> 02:39:53.450
THAT DOESN'T NEED A STANDARD

02:39:53.517 --> 02:39:55.252
WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE EXCLUDED

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:56.119
FROM CONSIDERATION FROM

02:39:56.186 --> 02:39:58.522
CONTRACTS SO. I'M VERY MUCH OF

02:39:58.588 --> 02:40:01.024
THE OF THE MINDSET THAT YOU

02:40:01.091 --> 02:40:02.192
BETTER HAVE A GOOD QUALITY

02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:04.261
PRODUCT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE AN

02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:07.130
EQUITABLE AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:08.699
TO BID ON THESE PROJECTS WE

02:40:08.765 --> 02:40:09.766
SHOULD PUT IN PLACE SOMETHING

02:40:09.833 --> 02:40:11.401
THAT WILL BE SENT TO VICE PEOPLE

02:40:11.468 --> 02:40:12.569
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

02:40:12.636 --> 02:40:14.471
WHAT. WE'RE NOT OUR CHANCES OF

02:40:14.538 --> 02:40:15.706
GETTING BIT WE'RE NOT EVEN GOING

02:40:15.772 --> 02:40:17.307
TO GO TO THE PROCESS AND THE

02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:19.443
EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE COST OF

02:40:19.509 --> 02:40:21.111
THOSE PROJECTS BECAUSE WHEN YOU

02:40:21.178 --> 02:40:22.846
HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:24.614
BIDDING ON THESE PROJECTS THEN

02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:26.383
YOUR COST YOU KNOW EVERYBODY

02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:28.218
THAT IS CURRENTLY ABLE TO BID ON

02:40:28.285 --> 02:40:29.519
THESE PROJECTS CAN INFLATE THE

02:40:29.586 --> 02:40:31.722
PRICE A LITTLE- YOU KNOW HIGHER

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:33.790
BECAUSE- THIS IS GOING TO BET ON

02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:35.559
IT. YOU'RE LIMITED ON HOW IT WAS

02:40:35.625 --> 02:40:37.828
TO I MUST HAVE BEEN A NET IT

02:40:37.894 --> 02:40:39.796
INADEQUATE IN HOW I EXPLAIN THIS

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:41.565
THERE IS NO VETTING PROCESS

02:40:41.631 --> 02:40:43.433
THERE IS NO SELECTION THE NEW

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.335
MAKES THE SELECTION EXACTLY A

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:47.537
FREE MARKET THE CUSTOMER SO NOW

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.906
THERE'S THREE DEVELOPERS WHO GO

02:40:49.973 --> 02:40:53.543
OUT AND SAY- FREMONT CALIFORNIA

02:40:53.610 --> 02:40:55.712
AND EACH BUILDING FIFTY UNITS

02:40:55.779 --> 02:40:57.914
OKAY. EACH BUILDING AND THEY'VE

02:40:57.981 --> 02:40:59.649
QUALIFIED IN THIS PROGRAM THEY

02:40:59.716 --> 02:41:04.988
HAVE SB THIRTY FIVE THEY. MET

02:41:05.055 --> 02:41:05.889
ALL THE PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS

02:41:05.956 --> 02:41:06.490
THAT ARE THERE. DEVELOPER ONE

02:41:06.556 --> 02:41:08.692
DOLLAR PER A DEVELOPER FOR. CAN

02:41:08.759 --> 02:41:09.626
WHO MAKES THE CHOI. THE

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:11.628
DETERMINATION OF COSTS ARE. THE

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:13.864
COST OF THEIR MATERIALS WHAT ARE

02:41:13.930 --> 02:41:15.465
LABOR COSTS DON'T HAVE LABOR

02:41:15.532 --> 02:41:16.733
COSTS THE SAME IMAGE ACROSS TO

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.735
THE SAME WILL DOUBLE MODEL THIS

02:41:18.802 --> 02:41:20.337
IN A WAY THAT THEY CAN MAKE

02:41:20.404 --> 02:41:21.538
MONEY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING

02:41:21.605 --> 02:41:23.473
TO DO THIS AND SHE GONNA MAKE

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.275
MONEY. AND THEN IF ONE MAKES A

02:41:25.342 --> 02:41:26.476
BETTER PRODUCT GET THE ONLY

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:27.477
THERE'S NOBODY ALSO MAKES A

02:41:27.544 --> 02:41:29.146
CHOICE THE PERSON MAKES THE

02:41:29.212 --> 02:41:30.480
CHOICE OF THE CUSTOMER I DECIDE

02:41:30.547 --> 02:41:31.448
TO BUY MR MAKOWSKI SAID

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:32.549
DEVELOPERS BECAUSE HE'S RATHER

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:34.518
RATHER MISTER CORTESE'S PRODUCT

02:41:34.584 --> 02:41:35.552
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S QUALITY IS

02:41:35.619 --> 02:41:36.386
BETTER AND THEY MAKE THE CHOICE

02:41:36.453 --> 02:41:38.422
THERE'S NO BIDDING CONTEST IN

02:41:38.488 --> 02:41:40.424
THAT SENSE. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE

02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:41.525
OF THE CONTRACTORS ARE GOING TO

02:41:41.591 --> 02:41:43.260
HAVE THE SAME PRETTY MUCH THE

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:44.995
SAME COSTS FOR LABOR COSTS SO

02:41:45.062 --> 02:41:46.396
YEAH AND SO THE ARGUMENT IS WILL

02:41:46.463 --> 02:41:47.798
INCREASE COSTS BUT THAT'LL BE

02:41:47.864 --> 02:41:49.599
ABSORBED OVER TIME IN TERMS OF

02:41:49.666 --> 02:41:52.235
THE AMORTIZATION. OF THE PAYMENT

02:41:52.302 --> 02:41:54.004
BECAUSE THE HOUSE MAY COST A

02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:55.272
LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE LABOR

02:41:55.338 --> 02:41:56.773
COSTS WITH MORE SO THE DOWN

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:58.375
PAYMENTS AT A BIT MORE THE

02:41:58.442 --> 02:41:59.810
MORTGAGE PAYMENT COSTS ARE LESS

02:41:59.876 --> 02:42:00.977
BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE LESS

02:42:01.044 --> 02:42:02.646
AND IT WORKS IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU

02:42:02.712 --> 02:42:06.083
GO TO LISA TOYOTA. AT THE STORE

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:07.851
YOU DON'T LOOK AT WHAT THE COST

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:08.752
OF THE ALTERNATOR IS THE TIRES

02:42:08.819 --> 02:42:10.787
YOU SEE WHAT'S MY MONTHLY

02:42:10.854 --> 02:42:11.388
PAYMENT THIS IS BASICALLY THE

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:12.556
SAME THING WAS THE QUALITY

02:42:12.622 --> 02:42:14.324
PRODUCT I LIKE IT AND WHAT'S MY

02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:16.059
MONTHLY PAYMENT THOSE ARE THE

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:17.828
THINGS TO THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO

02:42:17.894 --> 02:42:19.396
MAKE A PROFIT. THE BANK NEEDS TO

02:42:19.463 --> 02:42:21.498
MAKE PROFIT TO MAKE IT WORK THE

02:42:21.565 --> 02:42:22.232
OWNERS GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING

02:42:22.299 --> 02:42:23.433
THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY CAN.

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:25.268
THAT THEY LIKE SO NOBODY ELSE IS

02:42:25.335 --> 02:42:26.336
MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF

02:42:26.403 --> 02:42:28.405
PRICE OTHER THAN THE AND THE

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:29.840
QUALITY OF THE WORK OTHER THAN

02:42:29.906 --> 02:42:35.045
THE CUSTOMER AND THAT. AT THE

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:37.047
CORE IS CAPITALISM. OKAY SINGLE

ENERGY COMMISSION JUST DID A BIG

02:48:07.744 --> 02:48:09.612
STUDY ON THIS AND- IF YOU HAVE.

02:48:09.679 --> 02:48:12.048

GONNA NEED TO SUPPORT THIS

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:20.890
TRANSITION. SO WE NEED A ONE

02:48:20.957 --> 02:48:22.425
POINT TWO MILLION OR SEVENTY

02:48:22.492 --> 02:48:23.426
NINE THOUSAND. SOMETHING LIKE

02:48:23.493 --> 02:48:27.464
THAT SO- THE- ONE THING IS CLEAR

02:48:27.530 --> 02:48:29.299
POWERING UP AT HOME. IS THE

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:30.767
CHEAPEST MOST CONVENIENT AND

02:48:30.834 --> 02:48:33.269
MOST RELIABLE FORM OF FUELING AN

02:48:33.336 --> 02:48:35.638
EEVEE- BUT THOSE BENEFITS ARE

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:36.473
FAILING TO REACH COMMUNITIES

02:48:36.539 --> 02:48:38.208
THAT NEED THE MOST. I IN OF

02:48:38.274 --> 02:48:39.509
FOLKS YOU'VE GOT AS SINGLE

02:48:39.576 --> 02:48:40.577
FAMILY HOMES GOT THEIR OWN

02:48:40.643 --> 02:48:42.879
GARAGE IS ALMOST ALWAYS A- PLUG

02:48:42.946 --> 02:48:45.448
THEIR- YOU YOU KNOW IF I'M ABLE

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:46.883
TO CHARGE MY AB FOR EXAMPLE- BUT

02:48:46.950 --> 02:48:49.185
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

02:48:49.252 --> 02:48:50.320
MULTI FAMILY UNITS. ARE NOT SO

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:51.855
LUCKY. HI RETROFITTING CONDOS

02:48:51.921 --> 02:48:53.490
AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS AFTER

02:48:53.556 --> 02:48:55.425
THEY HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. IS

02:48:55.492 --> 02:48:56.860
NOT JUST COMPLEXITY IT'S ALSO

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:58.862
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. A LOT OF

02:48:58.928 --> 02:49:01.130
FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

02:49:01.197 --> 02:49:02.432
AND THEY RUN INTO BRICK WALLS

02:49:02.499 --> 02:49:03.967
BECAUSE THE EXPENSE. R. BUT IF

02:49:04.033 --> 02:49:06.035
YOU INSTALL THE EEVEE READY

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:07.470
CHARGING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

02:49:07.537 --> 02:49:09.806
WHEN YOU CONSTRUCT- IT'S A

02:49:09.873 --> 02:49:11.307
CREDIT IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS

02:49:11.374 --> 02:49:12.408
EXPENSIVE I'LL TALK A BIT MORE

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:14.277
ABOUT THAT. SO THEY DIDN'T THE

02:49:14.344 --> 02:49:16.212
NEWLY IT UPDATED TWENTY TWENTY

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:17.747
TWO CAL GREEN BUILDING CODE ONLY

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:19.282
REQUIRES GIVING 40% OF MULTI

02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:21.317
FAMILY PARKING SPOTS. ACCESS TO

02:49:21.384 --> 02:49:23.286
SOME FORM OF YOU CHARGING.

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:24.420
MEANWHILE THE PATCHWORK OF ONLY

02:49:24.487 --> 02:49:26.356
OVER THREE DOZEN LOCAL BUILDING

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:27.457
CODES IS CREATING CONFUSION FOR

02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:29.125
BUILDERS. IT'S LEAVING BEHIND

02:49:29.192 --> 02:49:31.094
MANY COMMUNITIES SUCH AS FIRE

02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:32.896
FOLKS AND FIRED IF DEVASTATED

02:49:32.962 --> 02:49:35.231
REGIONS AND RURAL AREAS- THESE

02:49:35.298 --> 02:49:40.537
ARE FOLKS. THEY TYPICALLY LACK

02:49:40.603 --> 02:49:42.505
THE CAPACITY TO DO ALL. SO MY

02:49:42.572 --> 02:49:44.274
STAFF IN THE BILL'S SPONSORS.

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:45.842
HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF

02:49:45.909 --> 02:49:47.844
THE FOLKS WHO RAISED CONCERNS

02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:48.678
ABOUT THE BILL- I AM VERY

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:50.246
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM.

02:49:50.313 --> 02:49:52.048
I TO FIND AS MUCH COMMON GROUND

02:49:52.115 --> 02:49:53.049
IMPLEMENTING THIS FRAMEWORK AS

02:49:53.116 --> 02:49:54.584
POSSIBLE. THERE'S THREE KEY

02:49:54.651 --> 02:49:55.652
TOPICS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING

02:49:55.718 --> 02:49:57.320
ON FIRST OF ALL MAKING A VERY

02:49:57.387 --> 02:49:59.756
CLEAR THE BILL ONLY APPLIES. TO

02:49:59.822 --> 02:50:01.925
NEW CONSTRUCTION. TWO

02:50:01.991 --> 02:50:03.993
SPECIFYING- THAT PROVIDING EVEY

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.662
READY CHARGING ACCESS DOES NOT

02:50:05.728 --> 02:50:07.864
OBLIGATE A LANDLORD OR BUILDING

02:50:07.931 --> 02:50:08.665
MANAGER TO PAY FOR THE

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:11.234
ELECTRICITY. TO CHARGE ANY

02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:12.769
RESIDENTS VEHICLE. I UNDERSTAND

02:50:12.835 --> 02:50:14.470
THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOU DON'T

02:50:14.537 --> 02:50:15.338
THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE THERE.

02:50:15.405 --> 02:50:17.440
BETWEEN THOSE WHO DO HAVE ANY

02:50:17.507 --> 02:50:19.175
YOU KNOW THE DON'T. AND FINALLY

02:50:19.242 --> 02:50:21.044
ENSURING THAT THE LEGISLATION IS

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:23.379
WORKABLE. IN INCIDENCES WHERE-

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:24.314
PARKING SPACES ARE NOT PRE

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:25.748
ASSIGNED TO RESIDENCES AND THIS

02:50:25.815 --> 02:50:27.517
IS A CONCERN WE'VE BEEN TALKING

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:28.918
TO FOLKS IN THE APARTMENT

02:50:28.985 --> 02:50:31.020
HONORED COMMUNITY. ABOUT OUR

02:50:31.087 --> 02:50:32.555

02:50:32.622 --> 02:50:34.857

TO. MANDATING THAT AB APARTMENT

03:08:00.202 --> 03:08:02.537

03:08:11.980 --> 03:08:13.882
AFTERWARDS AB MUCH MUCH LESS SO

LECTERN VEHICLES THERE ARE SOME

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:23.659
CONCERNS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE

03:08:23.725 --> 03:08:25.794
STARTING TO RISE ON. OUT WE'RE

03:08:25.861 --> 03:08:27.362
WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH ALL OF

03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:29.798
THESE- BATTERIES AND WHETHER OR

NOT THESE ARE ACTUALLY

03:08:30.866 --> 03:08:32.467
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MEANS

03:08:32.534 --> 03:08:34.536
THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S ONE OF THE

03:08:34.603 --> 03:08:36.004
BEST WAYS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO-

03:08:36.071 --> 03:08:37.973

03:09:03.899 --> 03:09:09.371
IS THAT. BY MANDATING- NEW

03:09:09.438 --> 03:09:11.073

COMMODITY BUT IF I GO WHAT THE

03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:28.457
WORD IS EVASIVE. AND- AND THEN I

03:09:28.523 --> 03:09:30.125
MADE EIGHTY AMENITIES AS AN

03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:32.728
AMENITY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE

03:09:32.794 --> 03:09:37.566
THAT THE STATE MIGHT BE-

03:09:37.632 --> 03:09:39.835
UNINTENTIONALLY CREW BEING

03:09:39.901 --> 03:09:40.569
INNOVATION AND OTHER

03:09:40.635 --> 03:09:43.138
ALTERNATIVE. TO GAS POWERED

03:09:43.205 --> 03:09:46.541
VEHICLES- INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES

03:09:46.608 --> 03:09:50.879
FOR THAT MORE- AB. IN ADDITION

03:09:50.946 --> 03:09:54.049
TO THAT I'M AND ALSO- YOU KNOW

03:09:54.116 --> 03:09:57.185
WE JUST TOWARD- A HYDRANT BUT

03:09:57.252 --> 03:10:00.021
FACILITY IN OUR DISTRICT IN MY

03:10:00.088 --> 03:10:01.189
TWELVE ACTIONS ON MY DISTRICT MY

03:10:01.256 --> 03:10:03.492
BORDERING DISTRICT AND- THERE'S

03:10:03.558 --> 03:10:05.026
A LOT GOING ON IN RESEARCH GOING

03:10:05.093 --> 03:10:08.563
ON WITH WITH THAT SPACE AS WELL-

03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:10.265
WHICH ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

03:10:10.332 --> 03:10:11.867
REVOLUTIONIZE THE TRANSPORTATION

03:10:11.933 --> 03:10:14.302
SECTOR SO. THERE'S A LOT OF

03:10:14.369 --> 03:10:15.837
INNOVATION COMING INTO WITH ZERO

03:10:15.904 --> 03:10:17.172
EMISSION VEHICLES ARE MOVING

03:10:17.239 --> 03:10:19.574
FORWARD AND IF THE STATE IS

03:10:19.641 --> 03:10:20.976
GOING TO COME AND JUST SAY OKAY

03:10:21.042 --> 03:10:22.444
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING WHAT

03:10:22.511 --> 03:10:23.445
WE'RE PUTTING A VALUE TO THEY

03:10:23.512 --> 03:10:26.481
WERE PRIORITIZING ELECTRIC

03:10:26.548 --> 03:10:28.183
VEHICLES INSTEAD OF ALLOWING.

03:10:28.250 --> 03:10:30.385
PER SE THE AB. I'M JUST A

03:10:30.452 --> 03:10:32.053
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURBING THE

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:33.221
INNOVATION THAT'S COMING

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:35.891
THROUGH- WITH OTHER MEANS OF

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:37.626
TRANSPORTATION ASIDE FROM FROM

03:10:37.692 --> 03:10:40.662
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FROM WHAT

03:10:40.729 --> 03:10:41.530
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ALSO

03:10:41.596 --> 03:10:43.431
CONCERN ON WHETHER OR NOT OUR

03:10:43.498 --> 03:10:45.367
GRID WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:46.568
THIS INCREASE IN ELECTRIC

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:48.303
VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS AND

03:10:48.370 --> 03:10:50.205
HOW THAT WILL AFFECT OTHER

03:10:50.272 --> 03:10:51.673
CUSTOMERS ON THE AGING

03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:55.010
ELECTRICAL GRID- IS THERE IS.

03:10:55.076 --> 03:10:58.213
INTERPLAY ON THAT BIGGEST AT. ON

03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:02.951
THAT END AND- AND- AND I THINK

03:11:03.018 --> 03:11:04.719
WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE DOING

03:11:04.786 --> 03:11:05.787
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO

03:11:05.854 --> 03:11:08.290
INCREASE INNOVATION IN ALL

03:11:08.356 --> 03:11:09.291
ALTERNATIVE SECTORS OF

03:11:09.357 --> 03:11:10.625
TRANSPORTATION AND JUST THIS

03:11:10.692 --> 03:11:11.993
SORT OF FOCUSING ON ELECTRIC

03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:13.328
VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:14.462
ARE CONCERNS THAT ARE STARTING

03:11:14.529 --> 03:11:16.464
TO RISE AND MANY MANY PEOPLE TRY

03:11:16.531 --> 03:11:18.133
TO DISCUSS THAT AND IS A

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:20.802
PERMANENT OF LOCAL CONTROL- I

03:11:20.869 --> 03:11:22.270
BELIEVE THAT EACH MULTI FAMILY

03:11:22.337 --> 03:11:24.539
COMPLEX OWNER AB SHOULD EVALUATE

03:11:24.606 --> 03:11:26.541
THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES I

03:11:26.608 --> 03:11:29.177
WHICH YOU MIGHT NOT INCLUDE-

03:11:29.244 --> 03:11:30.178
ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING

03:11:30.245 --> 03:11:32.681
STATIONS- AND ANY MEASURE THAT

03:11:32.747 --> 03:11:34.015
POTENTIALLY INCREASES THE COST

03:11:34.082 --> 03:11:35.717
OF HOUSING IS CONCERNING TO ME.

03:11:35.784 --> 03:11:37.586
SPECIALS IS WE'RE IN THE MIDST

03:11:37.652 --> 03:11:38.954
OF A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS

03:11:39.020 --> 03:11:41.756
SO- I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL

03:11:41.823 --> 03:11:44.159
BUT I REALLY DO COMMEND THE

03:11:44.226 --> 03:11:48.296
MERIT OF TRYING TO INCREASE MORE

03:11:48.363 --> 03:11:49.865
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY-

03:11:49.931 --> 03:11:51.466
OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE AND- YOU

03:11:51.533 --> 03:11:53.635
KNOW. IT IS FIRST I JUST WANT TO

03:11:53.702 --> 03:11:56.338
LET YOU KNOW. I WE HAD CONCERNS

03:11:56.404 --> 03:11:57.405
ABOUT BUYING AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

03:11:57.472 --> 03:11:59.274
BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY FOR MY

03:11:59.341 --> 03:12:00.308
DAUGHTER TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE

03:12:00.375 --> 03:12:02.611
THE STATION SO I GET THAT THAT

03:12:02.677 --> 03:12:03.645
PORTION FOR IT AS WELL. BUT I

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:06.114
AM. BUT I AM OVERALL CONCERNED

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:07.816
ABOUT THE STATE COMING IN IS

03:12:07.883 --> 03:12:09.951
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANNA

03:12:10.018 --> 03:12:10.919
ENCOURAGE BECAUSE IT MAY

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:13.255
UNINTENTIONALLY CURB INNOVATION

03:12:13.321 --> 03:12:16.658
IN OTHER AREAS. ON THAT SEVEN.

03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:18.593
YEAH I KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE

03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:19.594
TOUCHING UPON SOME OF THE BIG

03:12:19.661 --> 03:12:21.429
DEBATES THAT ARE HAPPENING IT A.

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:22.898
R. B. AND R. CLIMATE WORKING

03:12:22.964 --> 03:12:24.599
GROUP AND WE'VE BEEN HAVING ALL

03:12:24.666 --> 03:12:25.467
THESE DISCUSSIONS I KNOW

03:12:25.533 --> 03:12:26.334
ACTUALLY IN PREPARATION FOR

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.737
THIS- LINDA. HUTCHINS I WAS ONE

03:12:28.803 --> 03:12:29.738
WITNESSES OUT AN INTERESTING

03:12:29.804 --> 03:12:32.173
ANALOGY ON THIS ISSUE I ASSUME.

03:12:32.240 --> 03:12:34.609
THAT THAT. WE DID YOU WANT TO.

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.444
DO IT IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO

03:12:36.511 --> 03:12:37.379
THE SENATE QUESTION. YEAH JUST A

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:42.150
BRIEF. THANK YOU SENATOR RIDLEY

03:12:42.217 --> 03:12:44.152
PLEASE. OKAY BREAK. UP I REALLY

03:12:44.219 --> 03:12:45.587
WANTED. TO REALLY GREAT. ABOUT

03:12:45.654 --> 03:12:47.455
BY THIS YEAR THE END DATE. I

03:12:47.522 --> 03:12:48.690
WANT TO SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE. I

03:12:48.757 --> 03:12:50.425
THINK OF REALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:12:50.492 --> 03:12:51.960
UNDERSTAND. BACK IN THE NINETEEN

03:12:52.027 --> 03:12:54.829
SIXTIES. AND OUR COUNTRY WE HAVE

03:12:54.896 --> 03:12:55.697
SUCH A THING CALLED COLDWATER

03:12:55.764 --> 03:12:57.799
FLATS. AND THAT MEANS THAT

03:12:57.866 --> 03:12:59.234
APARTMENT IN LOW INCOME

03:12:59.301 --> 03:13:00.635
COMMUNITIES. DID NOT ACTUALLY

03:13:00.702 --> 03:13:02.404
HAVE COLD WATER. THE BUILDERS

03:13:02.470 --> 03:13:04.072
WANT TO SAVE MONEY. AND THEY

03:13:04.139 --> 03:13:05.607
SEEM TO THINK LOWER INCOME

03:13:05.674 --> 03:13:06.808
RENTERS COULDN'T AFFORD TO.

03:13:06.875 --> 03:13:08.710
DEMAND HOT WATER SO THEY BUILT

03:13:08.777 --> 03:13:09.945
THESE BUILDINGS WITH NO. WITH NO

03:13:10.011 --> 03:13:12.580
HOT BETTER ACCESS. RESIDENTS HOW

03:13:12.647 --> 03:13:14.516
TO BOIL THE WATER ON THE STOVE.

03:13:14.582 --> 03:13:15.717
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE

03:13:15.784 --> 03:13:21.456
GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN. AND SAID THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.

03:13:21.523 --> 03:13:24.025
NOT FAIR WE MUST SURE ALL THE OF

03:13:24.092 --> 03:13:26.027
YOUR- HAVE HOT WATER. BILL IN

03:13:26.094 --> 03:13:26.695
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE A PART

03:13:26.761 --> 03:13:29.197
OF COST THE BILL. THAT THAT

03:13:29.264 --> 03:13:30.999
BECAME. MANY MANY YEARS CITIES

03:13:31.066 --> 03:13:32.734
WERE FOR RESIDENTS TO HAVE TWO

03:13:32.801 --> 03:13:34.936
THE WATER ON THE STOVE. THIS AN

03:13:35.003 --> 03:13:36.571
EQUIVALENT. WHAT WILL NOT BE

03:13:36.638 --> 03:13:39.074
ABLE TO PURCHASE. IT- GAS

03:13:39.140 --> 03:13:41.176
POWERED CAR INTERSTATE IN TWENTY

03:13:41.242 --> 03:13:42.944
THIRTY FIVE. THEY NEED A PLACE

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:44.946
TO CHARGE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. SO

03:13:45.013 --> 03:13:47.215
PLEASE STOP READING THE BUILDING

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:49.484
INDUSTRY TRY TO BILL COLD WATER

03:13:49.551 --> 03:13:50.885
FLAT AND WALK OUT LOW INCOME

03:13:50.952 --> 03:13:52.954
NEED THE COLOR FROM ACCESS TO BE

03:13:53.021 --> 03:13:57.892
CHARGING AT HOME WHERE IT'S THE

03:13:57.959 --> 03:13:58.493
MOST AFFORDABLE. IF I COULD.

03:13:58.560 --> 03:14:00.295
AGREE THE CAN ABOUT THE CELL ARE

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:02.464
. AND NOT WANTING TO- MAYBE

03:14:02.530 --> 03:14:05.000
PRIOR ONE OVER THE OTHER I JUST

03:14:05.066 --> 03:14:06.501
WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. FOR

03:14:06.568 --> 03:14:08.103
THREE REASONS BATTERY POWERED

03:14:08.169 --> 03:14:09.471
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE MUCH

03:14:09.537 --> 03:14:12.240
BETTER THAN FUEL CELL VEHICLES.

03:14:12.307 --> 03:14:14.009
NUMBER ONE THEY'RE EXTREMELY

03:14:14.075 --> 03:14:15.910
MORE EFFICIENT. SO THEY ARE MUCH

03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:16.578
MORE AFFORDABLE FOR EXTRA

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:19.414
DRIVERS. AND THEY ARE MUCH LESS

03:14:19.481 --> 03:14:21.316
EXPENSIVE TO CHARGE DID YOU KNOW

03:14:21.383 --> 03:14:23.885
THAT IT TAKES ONE TO TWO MILLION

03:14:23.952 --> 03:14:26.688
DOLLARS TO INSTALL A HYDROGEN

03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:28.656
FUEL PUMP. THAT IS A HUGE AMOUNT

03:14:28.723 --> 03:14:30.392
COMPARED TO THE COST OF THE

03:14:30.458 --> 03:14:31.860
PHONE WHICH- THANK YOU THANK YOU

03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:33.728
VEHICLE PARKING. I WOULD AFFECT

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:36.398
THEIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:38.566
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

03:14:38.633 --> 03:14:41.302
COLLEAGUES. OKAY TERRIFIC

03:14:41.369 --> 03:14:43.238
DELIVER I'M SORRY TO SOMEONE

03:14:43.304 --> 03:14:44.439
MOVE THE BILL I CAN'T REMEMBER.

03:14:44.506 --> 03:14:47.442
OUR MOTION BY CENTER BY CAL SKI-

03:14:47.509 --> 03:14:48.576
CENTER ON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

03:14:48.643 --> 03:14:50.612
THIS BILL FORWARD I WHICH IS

03:14:50.678 --> 03:14:52.614
CALLED PASSED LONG TIME AGO- IT

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:54.349
IS. IT'S LIKE A TEACHER CAUSES

03:14:54.416 --> 03:14:56.384
ALL PSYCHIC PAIN EVERY TIME AN

03:14:56.451 --> 03:14:58.386
APARTMENT BUILDING OR CONDO

03:14:58.453 --> 03:15:00.422
BUILDING GETS BUILT AND THEN.

03:15:00.488 --> 03:15:03.058
PEOPLE CAN'T CHARGE MTV AND EVEN

03:15:03.124 --> 03:15:06.394
ALREADY DOES EVERYTHING YEAH HI-

03:15:06.461 --> 03:15:10.965
EVEN THOUGH- YOU KNOW WE NEED

03:15:11.032 --> 03:15:12.233
TO. AGGRESSIVELY INVEST IN

03:15:12.300 --> 03:15:15.537
TRANSIT- BUT WE KNOW THAT IN

03:15:15.603 --> 03:15:16.771
TERMS OF CLIMATE THE MOST

03:15:16.838 --> 03:15:18.373
IMPORTANT THING ONE OF THOSE

03:15:18.440 --> 03:15:20.542
FOUR THINGS WE CAN DO IS TO HAVE

03:15:20.608 --> 03:15:21.810
A LOT OF DENSITY NEAR TRANSIT

03:15:21.876 --> 03:15:24.279
AND JOBS- HAVING A MORE

03:15:24.345 --> 03:15:26.081
SUSTAINABLE VEHICLE FLEET IS

03:15:26.147 --> 03:15:28.716
DEFINITELY PART OF THE- SOLUTION

03:15:28.783 --> 03:15:31.986
AND- IT'S JUST. IF WE REALLY

03:15:32.053 --> 03:15:33.388
REALLY REALLY MEAN IT WHEN WE

03:15:33.455 --> 03:15:35.757
SAY THAT WE WANT TO ELECTRIFY

03:15:35.824 --> 03:15:38.026
RIGHT. TRANSPORTATION PLEA. YOU

03:15:38.093 --> 03:15:38.960
HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION

03:15:39.027 --> 03:15:40.962
OF ACTUALLY DOING THAT AND I

03:15:41.029 --> 03:15:42.464
WILL SAY THAT YOU'RE FOR ME

03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:44.099
WHERE I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO

03:15:44.165 --> 03:15:46.101
WHERE I LIVE IN IN SACRAMENTO I

03:15:46.167 --> 03:15:49.537
HAVE. NO ABILITY- TO CHARGE- IS

03:15:49.604 --> 03:15:50.972
AB AND SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE

03:15:51.039 --> 03:15:52.607
TO DO SOMETHING THAT ONE DO

03:15:52.674 --> 03:15:53.241
SOMETHING RIVER GIVING

03:15:53.308 --> 03:15:55.743
SUBSIDIES. AND THEY CAN'T.

03:15:55.810 --> 03:15:57.545
CHARGE AND THEY HAVE TO STRUGGLE

03:15:57.612 --> 03:15:59.280
TO DO THAT IS THERE ANYONE THERE

03:15:59.347 --> 03:16:00.482
WHITE PEOPLE ARE HESITANT TO DO

03:16:00.548 --> 03:16:02.350
THAT IN THE UPTAKE OF BEEN. ON

03:16:02.417 --> 03:16:04.586
NOT NEARLY WHAT WE WANT SO THIS

03:16:04.652 --> 03:16:06.287
IS IMPORTANT AND I SUPPORT THE

03:16:06.354 --> 03:16:07.322
BILL AND I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE

ARE WORKING HARD TO ALSO MAKE

03:16:14.162 --> 03:16:15.330
SURE WE REALLY MINIMIZE THE

03:16:15.396 --> 03:16:17.298
COMPLEXITY FOR BILL FOR- FOR
