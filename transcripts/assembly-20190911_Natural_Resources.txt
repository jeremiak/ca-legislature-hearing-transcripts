OR CALL TRANSACTION ARE LAST TIME AROUND WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT BOTH SB FIFTY FOUR. I WHEN WE WHEN THIS COMMITTEE HEARD THE BILL. IN JUNE ARE WE VERY CLEARLY HEARD CONCERNS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HI THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS REAL CONCERNS. WE REALLY DID TAKE THOSE CONCERNS TO HEART. AND I GOT TO SAY WE WORK TIRELESSLY OVER THE SUMMER AND I JUST HAVE TO. GIVE A BIG SHOUT OUT TO THE STAFF ESPECIALLY WHO JUST WORK SO HARD TO. SOLVE FOR EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS SOLVABLE AND I DON'T SAY THAT. LATELY WE HAD COUNTLESS CONVERSATIONS ALL STAKEHOLDERS THE MINISTRATION. IT'S ADDRESS TO THE BILL NOW IN PRINT REFLECTS NUMEROUS CHANGES THAT WE MADE BASED ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS THE RECYCLING RATES IN THE BILL ARE NOW MATERIAL NEUTRAL SO AS TO NOT PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS AMONG MATERIAL TYPES AND THEY DON'T AS A RESULT THEY DON'T THEY DO NOT RESULT IN THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR PENALTY. UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN INCLUDES EVALUATING POTENTIAL END USE MARKETS FOR MATERIAL. AND EVALUATING TRANSITIONING OTHER RECYCLING PROGRAMS. ARE THE ROLE RETAILERS HAS BEEN CLARIFIED UNDER THE BILL GIVING THEM SOME CERTAINTY AS TO HOW THE PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THAT WAS VERY MEANINGFUL TO PEOPLE. THEBASELINE CALCULATION OFFER WASTE REDUCTION HAS BEEN STREAMLINED AND NOW REALIZE AN EXISTING SERVICE BY POWER CYCLE. OUR BUSINESSES CAN COMPLY. WITH THE SOURCE REDUCTION ELEMENT IN THE BILL BY COMPLETING CHECKLIST THAT INCLUDES CONSIDERATION SUCH AS PROJECT PRODUCT PROTECTION. AND SHELF LIFE IS EXCESS AS SUGGESTED BY OUR STAKEHOLDERS. HOW WE CLARIFY THE NO REGULATIONS DEVELOP INTO THIS BILL COULD CONFLICT WITH ANY FEDERAL REGULATIONS OR LAWS. AND I WILL I WILL SAY THIS IS AN IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP WE'VE SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT LAWS RELATING TO FOOD AND DRUG SAFETY. I AS REQUESTED BY CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURE. HI ANDWE'VE SO WE MADE IT REALLY CLEAR THAT IF THERE'S ANY HEALTH OR SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. THOSE THOSE ISSUES ARE ON ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSED AND- AND IF THERE'S ANY VIOLATION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THE THOSE PRODUCTS WILL BE. ARE EXEMPT. THE BILL ALLOWS FOR EXEMPTIONS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. OUR WE'VE ADDED AN INDEPENDENT STAKEHOLDER PANEL TO CONSULT AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CARRY CYCLE TO ENSURE GREATER STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM. I WE HAD A MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PRODUCERS CHOOSING TO FORMA STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION AND MAKE CLEAR THAT NO ENERGY CAN BE REQUIRED TO JOIN A STORAGE OF ORGANIZATION THAT'S ANOTHER. IMPORTANT THING TO MENTION THERE'S. THERE'S NO COERCION HERE HIDE IT BUT IT IS AN OPTION. WE'VE ADDED THE ABILITY FOR CAROL TO CHARGE A REGULATORY FEE FOR THE COST OF THEIR WORKLOAD IMPLANTING THE PROGRAM. WHICH IS HOW SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN THE DEPARTMENT AND AS WELL AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITH ANY PAIR FUNDED THIS IS THE PROP TWENTY SIX IS GOVERNED BY BY THOSE RULES. MOST RECENTLY WE ALSO AMENDED THE BILL TO DELAY PHASING IN C. R. V. CONTAINERS INTO THE PROGRAM UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX THIS ENSURES THAT THEY GET CREDIT FOR THE INVESTMENT. AND WORK THEY'VE ALREADY DONE AS PART OF THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM BUT STILL ENSURES THAT THE EVENTUALLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIRED RECYCLING RATES AND REGULATIONS. SO. WE ARE WE HEARD FOLKS HERE SAY WE HADN'T DONE ENOUGH HOMEWORK WE'RE HERE IN JUNE LET ME JUST TELL YOU THE RESULTS OF OUR HOMEWORK BECAUSE THESE CHANGES AND I THINK ANYBODY'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH BILLS UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS TO CRAFT THESE THINGS TO ADDRESS THE KINDS OF CONCERNS THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR GOALS SO ARE WE NOT COVERING GROSSES AS HE SHOULDN'T IN SUPPORT. DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY IS IN SUPPORT MANY OTHER GROUPS HAVE GONE NEUTRAL LET'S GO THROUGH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL. AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION DURING GAMBLE S. C. JOHNSON THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION TECH NET WALMART CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA CRAFT BREWERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA BEER AND BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS ANHEUSER BUSCH MILLER COURSE PEPSI ARE BOTH THE BILLS SB FIFTY FOUR AND TWENTY WERE REMOVED FROM THE CHAMBERS JOCULAR LIST I THIS IS ALL TO SAY THAT WE REALLY DID TAKE THE COMMITTEES ASKS. SERIOUSLY WE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR WHEN YOU SAID YOU WANT US TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND GET THIS RIGHT I THINK ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH A BIG BILL UNDERSTANDS I HOW MUCH WORK IS INVOLVED IN IN GETTING ALL THESE PEOPLE ON BOARD AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY THE BILL WHICH ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT ADDRESSING OUR- CRISIS WITH THE REST WASTE MANAGEMENT. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM YOUR CITIES ABOUT HOW THEY'RE JUST BEING BURIED BY THE SHIFT. IN THE WASTE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. AND SO I YOU KNOW I WILL SAY WE DO KNOW THERE ARE STILL SOME GROUPS THAT ARE OPPOSITION THIS BILL MANY OF THEM HAVE A LITTLE HE POPPED UP IN OPPOSITION IN THE FINALWEEK BEFORE PASSAGE SOME OF THEM ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT. DID NOT EVEN EXIST. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. I AND I GOT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW. WE WORKED REALLY HARD I'M THEY'RE JUST SOME GROUPS OUT THERE YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SOME I'M SURE. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE. AFTER ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE THAT THEY'RE JUST SOME GROUPS OUT THERE THAT ARE JUST NOT INTERESTED IN THE END OF THE DAY. IN GETTING THE GAS OR GETTING A NEUTRAL AND IT SHORT OF GETTING THE BILL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE WOULD LOVE TO. SOME OF IT WILL MAKE A STUDY BILL GREAT BUT WE REALLY HAVE A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS HERE WE WANT ADDRESS WE WANT TO STRIKE WHILE THE IRON IS HOT. AND WITHOUT MEMBERS ASK YOUR RIVAL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES. LET ME OPEN BY STATING THAT CHANGES DISCONCERTING IT IS DISCONCERTING TO ALL HUMANS AND TO ALL BUSINESSES. BUT I'M REMINDED OF AB NINE THIRTY NINE THAT IMPLEMENTED OR CREATED THE REQUIREMENT TO DIVERT 50% OF OUR SOLID WASTE BY TWENTY TWENTY. RESIDENTS CITIES AND SOLID WASTE COMPANIES LIKE REPUBLIC SERVICES PLAYED THEIR PART OF MUCH OF IT WAS UNCERTAIN BUT THE JOURNEY OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. WHILE NOT PERFECT HAS INDICATED THAT THE CHANGES BROUGHT BY A. B. NINE THIRTY NINE WERE A GOOD START BUT WE'RE NOT FINISHED. THE CHANGE PROPOSED BY SENATE BILL FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION TEN EIGHTY ALSO CAUSES REPUBLIC SERVICES SOME LEVEL OF CONSTERNATION. BUT THE ALTERNATIVE OF NO BILL TO REPUBLIC IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION HAS STATED THAT WE HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME AS SOLID WASTE OPERATORS AND I WOULD SIMPLY POINT TO THE THIRTY YEARS OF HISTORY THAT SHOWS THAT RESIDENTS. BUSINESSES. SOLID WASTE OPERATORS AND THEIR CITIES HAVE ALL PITCHED IN. IN THIS BILL ENSURES THAT ALL PLAYERS FROM MANUFACTURERS CONSUMERS IN THE SOLID WASTE OPERATORS AND CITIES ALL HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. WE ARE ALSO HEARTENED BY THE COMMITMENT MADE BY SENATOR ALAN AND BY THE OTHER CO AUTHORS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A INFRASTRUCTURE FEE BILL AND TO HAVE THAT BILL INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. FOR PURPOSES OF CONSIDERATION NEXT YEAR. AND SO WE ARE ALL TAKING A GOOD LEAP OF FAITH ONE THAT WE THINK IS WARRANTED. GIVEN THE WORK OF THIS AUTHOR AND THIS STAFF. AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'RE GONNA GET THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND SO WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS WE ARE RICHER AYE VOTE. THANK TWO MINUTES EXACTLY MANAGER MEMBERS AIR MARINO MAP THE COMPANY GROW SOLICITATION IN SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE REALLY WANT TO THANK CENTER AROUND. AS A MEMBER GONZALEZ AND SENATOR SKINNER STOP ALL THE HARD WORK THEY'VE DONE I CAN VOUCH FOR CENTER AROUND WHEN HE DOES SAY THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK THAT WAS PUT IN. BETWEEN THE FIRST TURN THIS BILL AND WHERE WE ARE NOW THEY'VE BEEN VERY MINDFUL ABOUT THE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SPECIALLY TO FOOD. AND WE'RE SATISFIED WITH OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT ADDRESS THAT GROCERY INDUSTRY IS AS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS AND THIS SENDS MESSAGES TO THE MARKET THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR. MORE RECYCLABLE SUPPLIES MORE SUSTAINABLE SUPPLIES AND I THINK THIS WILL HELP OUR BUSINESSES ARE COMPANIES MOVING FORWARD AND AGAIN APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE CENTER ALLEN AND SIMILAR GONZALEZ AND- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A TAPER ANY ANY FIXES THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT LIKE YOU SAID WE NEED TO STRIKE. WHILE THE IRON IS HOT AND HAPPY TO BE A PART OF THAT EFFORT. THANKS VERY MUCH.

IN THE MEDIA AND THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BEEN FOCUSED ON PLASTIC A PLASTIC POLLUTION PLATT IN A REDUCTION OF PLASTIC WASTE ALL VERY HONORABLE THINGS FROM THE GLASS CONTAINERS. INDUSTRIES PERSPECTIVE THERE'S TWELVE FINDINGS IN THE BILL THERE'S TWELVE FINDINGS IN BILL EIGHT OF THE FINDINGS ARE AN INDICTMENT ON PLASTIC. ALL GOOD. THREE ONE FINING IN THERE ABOUT PAPER CARDBOARD WASTE IN THE BLOOD THE PAPER CARDBOARD BOARD WASTE. THERE ARE ZERO FINDINGS IN THE BILL DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM OF GLASS GLASS CONTAINERS GLASS WASTE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO GLASS GARBAGE PATCH IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. GLASSES MADE FROM NATURAL MATERIALS IT'S MADE FROM IN A SENSE MADE FROM SAND SO ACTION LIMESTONE. AND RECYCLE GLASS SO WERE WERE REALLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL BECAUSE WERE IN THE BILL IT REALLY NEVER. WAS THAT BIG OF A CONCERN WHEN THIS BILL IS REALLY JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW CREATING. A SCOPING PLAN AND HAVING CARRY CYCLE LOOK AT THIS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THEN ON SEPTEMBER SIX. BOTH BILLS ON. YOU KNOW CREATED WHAT LEAD COUNSEL READING RIGHT FROM THE DIGEST CREATES A COP PROTECT COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY SCHEME. IN CENTER THING THE LEDGE COUNCIL CHOSE WORDS SCHEME NOT A RATE FOR A PROGRAM OF REGULATORY SCHEME. AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR ISSUE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE GLASS CONTAINER INDUSTRY DOES NOT WANT TO BE PART OF A REGULATORY SCHEME. FOR TO CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY CIRCULAR PACKAGE FOR PACKAGE THAT'S ALREADY A CIRCULAR PACKAGE GOT GLASSES 1100% RECYCLABLE. THIS HANDLE PROPERLY IT COULD. BE A BOTTLE BECOME A BOTTLE ONE BOTTLE CAN BE. NOW IN THE STATE. pRECYCLED CONTENT IN THE IN CLASS CONTAINERS MAIN CALIFORNIA'S 35% RIGHT NOW GLASS CONTAINERS MAY IN CALIFORNIA MEETING A MINIMUM RECYCLE I MEAN MEANING A RECYCLED CONTENT STANDARD OF FORTY THREE AND A HALF PERCENT. THERE'S GLASS CONTAINERS MAY ALL OVER THE WORLD ALL OF THE COUNTRY AND IN A LOT OF THOSE ARE COMING IN IT YOU KNOW FIFTY OR 60% SO I HAVE YOU WRAP OF YOUR COMMENTS AS YOU CAN I WILL WILL SO WE PAY FEES ALREADY IN THE BOTTLE BILL WE PAY FEES WE PAY WE PAY FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY WANT TO WANT TO BE COMPETITION THESE BILLS WE PAY WE DO THIS ALREADY WE HAD WE HAD SUPPORT A SECONDARY PROCESSOR GIVES US MATERIAL.

LET US TO THIS POINT HEARD OF SUPPORT TESTIMONY FROM SEGMENTS OF THE WASTE INDUSTRY A MOMENT AGO BUT NOW YOU'RE HEARING THE REST. AND I SAY A SLIGHT MAJORITY THE WASTE INDUSTRY. WITH OPPOSITION AND OUR CONCERN IS THE OPPOSITE OF MR ROBESON'S WE DON'T WE'RE NOT SURE WHEN THE BILL. TO THE EXTENT THE BILL NOW CREATES A PATHWAY AND ENHANCES. BILL THE- AS THE VEHICLE BY WHICH PRODUCERS CAN SATISFY THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE A PROBLEM. LET ME BACK UP A MINUTE I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF LAST YEAR PROMOTING AS THE SPONSOR. THROUGH MY CLIENTS SB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT RUBIO I WAS DELIGHTED BUT SENATOR ALLEN TOOK UP THE CAUSE OF ADDRESSING NATIONAL SORT. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS IT IN THE DRESSING THAT IT FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EPR PACKAGING A. B. R. HAS NOT WORKED. IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO IN THE CONTEXT OF HARD TO HANDLE MATERIALS IF THAT'S AS FAR AS THE P. R. GOES WERE CONTENT WITH THAT. BUT THE THREAT NOW IS TO OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF EXISTING SOLD WASTE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. DEPENDING ON HOW PARTICULAR PRODUCER CHOOSES TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BILL. A GREAT AMOUNT OF THAT MATERIAL COULD BE DIVERTED FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE NETWORK THAT WE BUILT THE RELIES ON THIS FEEDSTOCK FOR SUSTAINING ITS OPERATIONS. I DARE SAY THAT A LOT OF MY MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATIONS ARE INDIVIDUAL FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES. HAVE CONSTRUCTED MERSE PERSONALLY GUARANTEED THE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY'LL BE OPERATING FOR THE THIRTY YEAR TIME CYCLE YOU NEED TO PAY OFF THAT. LOAN IF INDEED OF. THE P. R. COMES IN AT ALL PACKAGING IS NOW HAVE ANOTHER WAY BY PRODUCERS. IF WE HAD MORE TIME I COULD GO INTO MORE THIS. OKAY WELL THAT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ONE LIST OF THE CLIENTS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER BUT THERE'S STILL THREE REMAINING CENTER.

A CHALLENGE I THINK THAT ON IN THE END OF THE DAY THE GLASS HI IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MISTER OF HIS ABSOLUTE RIGHT IT'S GOT A HIGH RECYCLING RATE I IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT FROM ON THE MACRO AFFRONT FROM A FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE AND THERE'S THERE WITH THE BIG FOLKS INVOLVED WITH GLASS WORKED WITH US THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR THEY GOT THAT WE CREATED A SYSTEM THEIR THEIR BIG CONCERN WAS THAT THEY WERE GONNA BE DOUBLE CHARGED FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION. IN THE C. R. V. PROGRAM AND WITHIN SB FIFTY FOUR A. B. TEN EIGHTY AND AS A RESULT WE STRUCK A DEAL WITH THEM WHERE THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE IN A FOR THOSE FOLKS IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY WHO WERE MEETING THEIR TARGETS WOULD REMAIN IN SEE EVERY PROGRAM AND THEN AT ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND SO THEY WOULD BASICALLY BE EXEMPTED FROM THIS PROGRAM UNTIL THEN. AND THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE BIG PLAYERS IN CLASS LIKE THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION AND A LOT OF THE BEER FOLKS IN IN OTHER BEVERAGE FOLKS TO MOVE INTO A NEUTRAL POSITION THERE IS THIS INSTITUTE THE MISTER ROPES IN A REPRESENTS.

YOU KNOW IF WE HADN'T STRUCK A DEAL WITH THE AB I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD BE QUITE OPTIMISTIC BUT- I STILL THINK WE CAN GET THERE WITH HIM. AND WHEN YOU SAY WE CAN GET THERE JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINE ARE YOU THINKING THAT I'M NOT SAYING HE'S GOING TO. THAT NO IN TERMS OF THE REGULATIONS AS AS THE- INPUT AND THERE'S STILL A REGULATIONS PROCESS RIGHT THIS CREATES A STRUCTURED THIS WILL BE REGULATIONS THERE WILL BE PUBLIC INPUT IN THE REGULATIONS. OR ISN'T THAT KIND OF ACT THAT'S RIGHT ON A TIME WHEN THERE'S AN INTENSE ROBUST THE COLDER PROCESS BUILT INTO THIS BILL. THAT WILL THAT WILL INTIMATELY INVOLVED THE VERY INDUSTRIES THAT WILL BE INVOLVED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION REGULATIONS. ASSOCIATE HERE AND SO THERE WILL BE SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT THE FOLKS IN THE GLASS INDUSTRY. THEIR CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED AS A SAY ON THE NATURAL. THEY'RE ALREADY PRETTY WELL PLACED. TO MEET THE GOALS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RECYCLABILITY. ASSOCIATED WITH. THEIR INDUSTRY. RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS SOME. PARTY YEAH THANK YOU. WELL FIRST OF ALL CENTER AND I KNOW THAT CHANGES. IS REALLY HARD. PUSHING THESE ISSUES ANDTHAT'S WHAT WE SEE HERE TODAY. NO THAT SAY THAT. WITH THE THING ABOUT SOMETHING SO BIG LIKE THIS WHEN WE'RE PUSHING MAJOR CHANGE THAT HALF THE PEOPLE ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OUTCOME THE OTHER HALF 4100% CERTAIN THE DOWNFALL OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. ACHIEVE SO RIGHT SO I GET THIS. YOU KNOW WE SEE THE PLASTIC PROBLEM WITH OUR OWN EYES THAT THE PUBLIC CERTAINLY SEES THAT THEY'RE ASKING US TO ENGAGE AND- I'M NOT CERTAIN THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO. CHANGE ON THEIR OWN THEY HAVE A VESTED INTERESTED. MAKE A LIVING MAKE MONEY BY THEIR PRODUCTS. MAKE A HANDSOME PROFIT AND- WAITING TO SEE THAT OTHER TECHNOLOGIES EVOLVE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE WE ARE HERE TODAY SO I SUPPORT THIS EFFORT I DO HAVE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. AND. THEY KIND OF GO HAND IN HAND SO ONE YOU TOUCHED ON THERE IS THE COURSE THE INDUSTRY THAT MAKES THE PRODUCTS WHICH THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE BUT THAT THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE IN LAYMAN'S TERMS THE HOLLERS AND THE PEOPLE THAT SORT THE MATERIALS I THINK THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN DAY TO DAY THE BUSINESS OF DOING THAT SO IT'S INTERESTING TO ME TO SEE ONE OF THE MEMBERS. IN SUPPORT AND YOUR IN YOUR STAR WITNESS AND THE OTHER IN STRONG OPPOSITION AND OF THE INDUSTRY AND ARE NOW UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE ASSOCIATION IS NEUTRAL BECAUSE AS A NORTH SOUTH SOUTH SPLIT AND BY RULES THAT IF THAT HAPPENS THE WHOLE ASSOCIATION IS IT IS NEUTRAL AND DOES NOT OPPOSE THE BILL SO THANKS FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT THEY BROUGHT UP IS THAT THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS IF YOU ARE PROCESS AND HOW. THAT WOULD THROW A MONKEY WRENCH IN THE ECONOMICS OF THIS ALL WORK AND SO ON I KNOW YOU PARTIALLY ADDRESS THAT IT MAY BE REPUBLIC LARGER PERSPECTIVE MAYBE A LARGER INTERNATIONAL INTERNATIONAL IDENTITY MAYBE THE SMALLER ONES ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SO BY WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP. REASSURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK AND IT GIVE I GUESS TO MY SECOND QUESTION MALES FROM OUT HERE RIGHT NOW THAT'S ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW I THE HOW YOU'RE LAYING THIS OUT HERE IS IN YOUR EYES I WOULD THINK IT'S BASED UPON IMPLEMENTATION FROM CAL RECYCLE AS FAR AS FLEXIBILITY THEM UNDERSTANDING WAS TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE HI MINTA PHASE AND LIKE WE DID MAYBE IT'S ABOUT EXAMPLE LIKE WE DID WITH THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT. GAVE A. R. P. HOW WE THINK OF THEM TIME COME UP WITH POLICIES REGULATIONS IT WASN'T DONE OVERNIGHT AND BY LARGE WE'VE ACHIEVED THE GOALS OF THE TENT. TO GET AFTER BY ADOPTING A MEASURE. SO THAT'LL HELP. YES ON ON THE CHALLENGES WITH IMPLEMENTATION YEAH AND LET ME JUST SAY ON THE ISSUE THE P. R. IT IS TOTALLY PRIMITIVE NOBODY'S FORCED INTO IT INCLUDING THE HOLLERS I AND THE THING IS NO MATTER WHAT WE ARE GOING TO STILL HAVE PACKAGING PRODUCTS AND WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO MOVE THOSE PACKAGING PRODUCTS AND GET IMMERSED MICHAEL TO GET IT TAKEN CARE OF SO NO MATTER WHAT THERE WILL BE. HOLLERS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT FOLKS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS THIS DOESN'T CUT OUT THE NEED FOR THAT INDUSTRY AT ALL EFFECTIVE ANYTHING IT IT JUST EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT INDUSTRY HI I THINK WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY RIGHT ASSEMBLYMEMBER THERE'S JUST NERVOUSNESS ARE VIEWED THE VERY SPOKE TO BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE SPACE OVER TIME I. HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE. AND THEY I'M- IN A EVERYBODY KNOWS THE MODEL IS ACTUALLY FINALLY BROKEN. BUT PEOPLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT ANY CHANGES MIGHT BE MADE TO THE MODEL. AND WHERE THEY FIT INTO THAT SPACE. AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING I THINK YOU SEE I THINK YOU CORRECTLY POINT OUT JUST DISPLAY IT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON THAT LEVEL OF NERVOUSNESS. I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT THE FOLKS WHO DO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. THE BILL AND IT REALLY IS A SPLIT HERE. ARE A WITHIN THE WASTE MANAGEMENT BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALLY RECOGNIZE THAT DATE WILL BE. A CRITICAL PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS PROGRAM THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND THEY WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE DO. BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE A MORE SOPHISTICATED COLLECTION AND RECYCLING SYSTEM. AS A RESULT IMPLEMENTATIONS PROGRAM AND WE HAVE BUILT THEM INTO EVERY STAGE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS THE SCOPING PLAN. THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THEY WILL BE A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. SO I'M. YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I HAVE A SPECIFIC WITH THAT BUT TALK MORE ABOUT. THE LONG TERM THAT THIS THAT CAL RECYCLE REGULATORY SCHEME I'M NOT SURE HOW LEDGE COUNCIL. DESCRIBED AS IS THAT HOW YOU WOULD JUST RATHER THAN A REGIME I SUPPOSE YEAH. BUT HOW WILL THAT WORK IN PLAIN ENGLISH. YEAH WELL AS FAR AS IS BILL BECOMES LAW. SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT YOU'RE NOT OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED HOW IS THAT HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT SO YOU'RE ALL OF BORN IN YOUR ON. YOUR ALLUSION TO THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTION ACT IS A GOOD ONE THOUGH I WOULD ONLY SAY THAT WE HAVE ON. IT IN THE SENSE THAT IT HAS CREATED A CREATES STRONG GOALS. AND IT SAYS FOLKS WE ALL GOT TO GET TOGETHER AND MEET THESE GOALS THESE GOALS ARE GOALS THAT ARE SET BY THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT YOU TO MEET THEM IF THEY'RE IMPOSSIBLE TO. MEET THERE WILL BE OFFENSE AND FLEXIBILITY BUT WE NEED TO SEND A CLEAR MARKET SIGNALS. TO AT TI INDUSTRY AND THE ENTIRE MARKET THAT. CALIFORNIA IS SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THIS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROBLEM AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA. CHART A PATH TO GET THERE. AND THEN BUT THE BIG DIFFERENCE I SUPPOSE BETWEEN. THE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS MAN YOU KNOW GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT. IS THAT THERE'S A MORE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BUILT IN WE HEARD CONCERNS FROM FOLKS ABOUT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH CAR WAS PERCEIVED AS AND RESPONSIVE AND- YOU KNOW DISENGAGED AND AN IMPERIOUS AND WE'VE BUILT IN A MUCH MORE ROBUST PROCESS FOR EVERYBODY TO REALLY BE ENGAGED IN. CREATING THE SCOPING PLAN. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD IS THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY. THE SAME. KIND OF MODEL IS THERE WHICH IS THAT WE SET STRONG GOALS WE CAN WIN POWER OUR GOVERNMENT TO HELP US GET TO THOSE GOALS. AND WE MAKE IT WE DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND ABOUT OUR SERIOUSNESS ABOUT REACHING THOSE GOALS. BUT WE BUILDING ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO. I TO ALLOW US TO CHANGING MANEUVER AND ADAPT TO THE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AS. WELL AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DID NOT WANT TO DO. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY. LAST TO THIS ABOUT HOW WE GET THERE. WE ALL KNOW THEM WHO WOULD HAVE IS THAT THE KIND OF POWER WE'RE CARRYING A POP THE TECHNOLOGY THAT DID THAT DIDN'T EXIST YOU KNOW JUST A DECADE OR TWO AGO. YOU KNOW THERE'S MORE COMPUTING POWER IN THESE THINGS AND THEN THE FIRST THE SPACE OF THE TOOK COMMAND OF THE MAN IN THE MOON. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE CONTINUES TO BE INNOVATIONS IN THIS WASTE MANAGEMENT SPACE AMINU SORTING MACHINES AND- AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOLLERS AND- THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE A BEFORE. AND THAT WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW I HOPE EVEN FASTER NOW THAT WE WAY ONCE WE PASS A BILL LIKE THIS WILL THAT WILL SEND MARKET SIGNAL TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. THAT THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY TAKING THIS WASTE REDUCTION GOAL SERIOUSLY AND MARKET OUT OF RESPOND WITH NEW SORTS OF TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIONS IN. AND WAYS OF ADDRESSING AND SORTING AND- AND ALL OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. SO I. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BIG BIG PROBLEMS. IT ACTUALLY IS A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN. I WHAT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOUR COMPARISON AB THIRTY TWO IS THAT IN SOME RESPECTS. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE KNOW WE CAN HELP TO ADDRESS HERE. BUT THE WE ACTUALLY. HAVE MORE SOLUTIONS HERE THAN WE EVEN HAD WITH A. B. THIRTY TWO THERE'S MORE LOW HANGING FRUIT IN THIS AREA WE KNOW THERE'S BETTER PACKAGING OUT THERE. THE REASON WHY SO MUCH INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WILLING TO PLAY BALL WITH US IS BECAUSE THE MORE MORE FORWARD THINKING FOLKS IN INDUSTRY. HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY DEVELOPING THE PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS TO RESPOND TO MARKETS LIKE OURS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SUSTAINABLE. AND SO THEY KNOW THEY COMMITTEES BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE NEED TO MEET THESE GOALS WE THEY KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE IS A PLANET. TOWARD MEETING THE KINDS OF GOALS. AND DONE AND THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN FOOT DRAGGING SOME OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THEIR LIVES THEIR LITTLE IF THEY'RE USUALLY FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN. BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OF MORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING. AND DONE AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT THAT STRUGGLE WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME IN STATE FOLKS. THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD IN THIS. SPACE AND OTHERS THAT REALLY DON'T WANT TO MAKE MOVES IN A SPACE SO. BUT THIS IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT SEND ABOUT HELPING TO MOVE. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND I MEAN GLOBAL. TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING. I BE IN BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY I SAID THIS BEFORE TO THIS COMMITTEE. WE WILL HAVE I WOULD DEEM THIS A FAILURE. IF WE DON'T SEND THE SORT OF MARKET SIGNALS GLOBALLY JUST AS WE DID WITH SB THIRTY TWO BUT I ACTUALLY WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THIS SPACE. I TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING PRODUCTS. BECAUSE EVERYBODY ALL OVER THE WORLD IS DROWNING. IN THEIR POLLUTION PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. HE FINISHED RECORDING YOU FINISH MISS GARCIA. AT THANK YOU AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK ON ON THIS BILL. NHIáU SAID MISTER PRESS SAID THAT THERE'S A COMPANION. FINANCING INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WORSE THAT AT CURRENTLY SO WE'RE WE'RE INTRODUCING INTENT LANGUAGE WE'RE AND WORD WHAT'S NOT GOING TO PASS THIS YEAR ONE IS THAT BEEN INTRODUCED I THINK BE. AND SINCE WE DECIDED IS THE LEAD AUTHOR AND IT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY CAN CENTER SKINNER. OKAY ART I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY CENTER SKINNER SHE'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARY IN OUR WORK AND ALL THIS AND SO THE BUT WE WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE WE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT IN EVERY STRUCTURED CHALLENGE HERE AND WE ARE OBSOLETE. SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING. AND SO. IF THE IRON IS HOT LIKE HE SAID WHY NOT DO BOTH NOW AND WHY NOT THE LIVE. SUPERMAJORITY LEFT THAT WE NEED TO DO IT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YOUR BILL. IS COMING SOONER OR LATER WHY NOT DO IT NOW AND THE IRON IS HOT AND WILL FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK AS YOU'VE SEEN. I WE TALKED ABOUT THE NERVOUSNESS RIGHT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING BIG WITH SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO IT BUT THERE'S ALWAYS. A LITTLE BIT NERVOUSNESS. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN APPRECIATE AS- A COLLEAGUE I HOW CHALLENGING IT WOULD BE TO. TO ADD ON THE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE OF MEETING A TWO THIRDS HURDLE. I GIVE IN HOW BIG A TASK WE HAVE WITH WITH JUST WITH THIS BILL. BUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT IN CONVERSATIONS WITH INDUSTRY I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY WILLING TO ACTUALLY. IT ENTHUSIASTICALLY GAP BEHIND A STANDALONE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING BILL I BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW NECESSARY IT WOULD BE TOO. I TO REALLY EFFECTUATE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. BUT YOU KNOW WE IN THE END OF THE DAY ON. OUR WITHOUT PUTTING IN PLACE A STRONG SET OF. OF GOALS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR FOLKS IN INDUSTRY TO REALLY GET BEHIND IN THE WAY THAT WE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO REACH THAT TWO THIRDS TRUSSELL. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SINCE I FOR THE FIRST BILL IN MARCH. LAST WEEK THAT TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT YOU STEP THAT DARREN A SIZE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER THIS IS SOMETHING HAS COME UP IN THE OPPOSITION. MULTIPLE TIMES FEE BILLS ARE HARD A IN TWELVE YEARS OUTSIDE THE BUDGET I'VE SEEN TWO OF THEM IN A CARRIED BOTH OF THEM. INSIDE CRISTINA HARD THE FIRE BUT THEY'RE NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. I WORRY ABOUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO START PAYING FOR THIS IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. ARE WE EVER GOING TO HAVE THAT WILL TO GET THAT FEE BILL DONE ARE WE GONNA KEEP COMING BACK AND SAYING HEY LET'S GET AYE CAPTAIN TRADE. LET'S GET OUT OF THE SPACE WHEN I FINISH REFER ANSWER ME BECAUSE THAT'S EVEN WHAT WE SEE IN WITH. OUR COMPOSTING SITUATION RIGHT NOW WE SET A GOAL AND HIGHWAY HELPING FOLKS GET THEIR OR THE MONIES ARE COMING FROM. ALONG THE WAY AND SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TOLD ALL OTHERS ARE GONNA DO THIS NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER THE SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE I NEVER SEE THAT FOLLOW UP. IF I MAY NOT DO I BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE A WILL. YEAH I JUST HAVE CONCERNS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT FULL TIME PORT AND I'VE BEEN BEHIND. ON BILLS INCLUDING OR TALKING ABOUT. AB THIRTY TWO SB THIRTY TWO ON HOW I WAS MOVING AND SO FORTH. ENTER I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S NOT A MERIT TO THAT ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING OUT THERE I DOES HAVE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT. ABOUT THAT IN A I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE IRON IS HOT AND EVERYTHING WE CUT OF THE DENTIST THIS YEAR. WHAT A TIME. THE DEADLINE FOR THAT WAS YESTERDAY AS AN INTRODUCED. US I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THAT DONE THIS YEAR'S I'M NOT ASKING FOR THAT AT THIS POINT BUT- I DO THINK THAT WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT DONE IN MUCH. WOULD HAVE BEEN A BIGGER LEFT BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT. THE AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE- VOLUNTARY STURDIEST STORAGE A PROGRAM OUT THERE. WE HAVE A TRANSFER HOW DID THOSE BETTER HERE WE HAVE ONE ON CARPET ONE ON MATTRESSES A LOT OF TIMES IT'S BEEN I LOOK THIS INCLUDING IN MY OFFICE AND HOPEFULLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE HAVE BETTER MODEL SINCE THAT'S THE MODEL THAT WE HAVEN'T FULLY GOTTEN OUT THERE BUT A MODEL THAT WE SHOULD EXPLORE. WHICH CREATES UNSERVED POSSIBILITIES TRY TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THESE FINANCING ISSUES AS WELL FROM I WOULD DO ONE OF KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'VE- DONE SOMETHING IN THAT SPACE I DON'T WANT TO. YOU KNOW BE ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT- CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME THE DECISION TO BE MATERIAL NEUTRAL AND BRING IN THE GLASS FOLKS INTO SITUATION IF THEY ARE KIND OF WHAT WE NORMALLY TRYING TO AS THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART. SETTING YOU KNOW WHAT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW LIKE THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO CABLE WE ALSO HAVE BEEN SPENDING. AT LEAST THREE YEARS TALKING ABOUT BOTTLE BILL ISSUES HERE I IN THE COMMITTEE RIGHT AND POLISH THAT WE HAVE THERE IN SO THE CAN YOU THINK TO BE THAT THIS ISN'T AS I WAS IN THE ROOM FOR. THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WILL OF THEIR READY DOING THIS ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT THERE'S THAT UNCOMFORTABLE LESSONS OF I PUT THEM IN THAT UNCOMFORTABLE NESS WHAT WHY WAS THAT NEEDED. YEAH OKAY FIRST OF ALL I'M TO BE YOU KNOW. THE REAL FRANK WITH EVERYBODY GLASS IS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BILL FROM THE VERY BEGINNING I YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE THAT THE INTENT LANGUAGES FOCUS ON PLASTIC AND ANY OTHER DAY THIS PLASTIC AND PLASTIC POLLUTION IS THE BIG BIG BIG PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE. BUT FROM A COLLECTION PERSPECTIVE HAVING LASSEN IS VITAL I AND EIGHT WE DID OFFER THIS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RELIEF TO GLASS IN THE CONTEXT OF. OF C. R. V. AND BASICALLY GIVING THEM THE EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTISAN THAT THOUGH YOU THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE MEETING THEIR RATES IN THE BOTTOM BILL. THAT'S THAT'S A BIG BIG EXEMPTION BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY. IF YOU LOOK AT SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD IT'S BEEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO. INCLUDE EVERYBODY. I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL AS THOUGH I AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST NERVOUSNESS. ABOUT A BILL AS BIG AS THIS FROM SOME FOLKS IN INDUSTRY. BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BILL IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE SYSTEM TO BE COMPREHENSIVE. OUT WE MADE OF A MAJOR CONCESSION TO GLASS WITH REGARDS TO OUR R. C. R. V. AMENDMENT. AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE JUST IN IN IN SUCH A BETTER PLACE TO MEET THE CORE GOALS OF THIS BILL. AND THAT'S WHY I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW THROUGH THE COURSE OF AS THE AS YET DIRECTOR PEACE COMES ONLINE AND- WE START THE SCOPING PROCESS I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN GET. MR OF SENATE HIS CLIENT TO A PLACE WHERE WAIT WHERE THEY'LL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WE'RE GOING. SO. NOT UP YOUR TIME WITH A GLASS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND SO UP UNTIL RECENTLY MOST OF US HAVE BEEN CONFUSED THEN AND IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT PLASTICS GLASS IS ALWAYS BEEN AND THE BILL WAS ALWAYS ABOUT WASTE. REDUCTION THAT WAS. YOU'RE IN IN THE LANGUAGE THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOCUS HAS BEEN ON PLASTICS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE THE MOST PROGRESS. I THINK YOU NEED TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I IT'S. I EVEN SAID THIS WHEN I YOU KNOW WINS BUT THE GLASS FOLKS CAME IN AND BEFORE WE- CRAFTED IN IN IN. MAY THIS AMENDMENT WORK ON THE C. R. V. I TOLD THEM I AYE IF YOU WERE THE LAST PEOPLE YOU'D EXPECT TO BE HAVING LIKE A- WEEK BEFORE FILE INTO SESSION CONVERSATION WITH BECAUSE- YOU GUYS. YOU KNOW ARE ARE ARE ARE SO GOOD IN THIS SPACE IN IN IN GENERAL. AND THEY SAY WELL WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT DOUBLE CHARGING THAT WAS THEIR CORE CONCERNED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE CHARGED FOR BOTH THE BOTTLE BILL CRV. AND FOR SB FIFTY FOUR SO THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OKAY LET'S KEEP YOU OUT. IN TILL TWENTY TWENTY SIX OF THE WERE YOU WERE YOU THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU WILL BE CHARGED. FOR START UP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SB FIFTY FOUR TEN EIGHTY TEN EIGHTY. AND THAT WAS ENOUGH. BECAUSE I THINK THEY RECOGNIZE WHAT WE WERE SAYING THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY. THEY'RE THEY'RE IN A STRONG PLACE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO TIE RECYCLABILITY GOALS. ANY OFFICER OF SAN ANSWER YEAH I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY I I'M I'M NOT DISPUTING ANY THAT IT REALLY IS. WE DIDN'T FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE IT WAS. EARLIER IN THE YEAR IT WAS REALLY ABOUT CARRY CYCLE SETTING UP A PROCESS AND HAVING A SCOPING PLAN IN DOING THIS AND THAT TO GET TO A REGULATORY MECHANISM AND IT WASN'T UNTIL SEPTEMBER SIX WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT YOU'RE GONNA RIP YOU'RE GONNA REGISTER AND PAY RATE TORY FEES. YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT'S WHEN THAT'S WHEN WE GOT A LITTLE MORE EXERCISED SO AND THEN AND ALL THAT WORKS PLASTIC CAME OUT OF THE BILL. SO. THE PLOT PLASTIC NOT A LOT OF PLACES THAT YOU'VE GOT A YOU KNOW BECAME. IN AN ART THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT MY CLIENT REALLY LOOKED AT IT AND SAID WELL NOW IT'S NOT A PLASTIC. I'M. I MEAN AT THE MISSILE AND GAVE US A FOR ANSWER OF WHAT WAS IN THERE AND WHAT MAYBE LESS SPINE IN THE MEDIA OR WHEN AND ARE PSYCHOLOGICAL IN OUR HEADS SO AND I IN THE CITY ANSWER. THIS CALL RECYCLE HEREBY H. MR SCOTT SOME PLANTS HERE. WHY DON'T YOU COME UP TO THE TABLE AND- SEE IF. ANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. DID WERE YOU WERE YOU CAN BE FRIENDS REAL SOON AND IF YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE YOURSELF ON THE MY. YEAH THIS IS THIS IS THE START OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL YET SIMILAR ERICA. ALL RIGHT. MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS SCOTT SMITH LINE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF COVER CYCLE. AT THANK YOU AND SO IN THE BILL WE ARE GIVING CAL RECYCLE REGULATORY FEE AT THE ALREADY. A THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. UP NOT I'M NOT A POSITION TO STATE A POSITION ON THE BILL OKAY I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT AS DRAFTED WE DO THINK. THE DEPARTMENT CAN IMPLEMENT THIS BILL. AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW LARGE THE TASK WILL BE OF IMPLEMENTING THE BILL ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. FIVE EMPLOYEES A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT THOUSAND EMPLOYEES DO YOU HAVE ANY CLUE OF WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE GOOD BUT IT'S A FAIR QUESTION IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION WITH ANY SPECIFICITY BECAUSE- THE- THE WAY THE BILL IS. CONSTRUCTED IS THAT IT PROVIDES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO THE PRODUCERS TO DETERMINE HOW THEY COMPLY. AND THEIR CHOICE OF COMPLIANCE WILL IMPACT THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM. WITH RESPECT TO THE FEE ITSELF I. ANTICIPATE THIS WILL BE. OF OUR SMALLER PROGRAMS BECAUSE THE FEE IS STRICTLY FOR THE REASONABLE REGULATORY COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM THERE'S NO WE'RE NOT GENERATING REVENUE TO SUPPORT MARKETS FOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE SPRING IN THIS. IN THIS BILL SO THAT FEE WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED ON ON THAT BASIS. ON THE TO THE EXTENT THAT. COMPLIANCE IS DRIVEN THROUGH ONE MECHANISM OVER ANOTHER. IT WOULD IMPACT THE MAT RESOURCES THAT WE NEED. TO BE DIRECT IN RESPONSE THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM AND IT WILL REQUIRE. A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE FROM FROM THE MINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT. WITH WHAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER PROGRAM WITH THIS TYPE OF DIVERSITY IN THE FRONT END SINCE YOU'RE SAYING IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE FRONT AND IF YOU BY DOING WHAT YOU'LL HAVE TO DO. AND HOW HAS THAT WORKED OUT. SO WE DON'T I CAN'T THINK OF AN ANALOGOUS PROGRAM RIGHT NOW MOST OF OUR STATUTES THAT WE IMPLEMENT EVERY SPECIFIC SO WE AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE FOUR IF YOU ARE PROGRAMS THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIC. AND THAT WE IMPLEMENT THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM AGAIN IS VERY SPECIFIC TO PRESCRIBE HOW HOW WE IMPLEMENT THAT PROGRAM. SO WE DON'T HAVE WELL THERE'S NOTHING CONTEMPLATED IN HERE THAT IS A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH. WE DON'T HAVE AN ANALOGOUS STATUTE THAT HAS THE BROAD ARRAY OF COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO THE PRODUCERS AND. THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE YOUR FLORA. THANK YOU CENTER SEE AGAIN I DO HAVE JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT TRY TO REMOVE PRODUCT OUT OF THE STREAM RIGHT MOVING WASTE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. BUT I CURIOUS IS WHERE WE SENDING THAT MATERIAL. I WE HAVE IT WE IT FEELS A LOT LIKE WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE ALL THIS MATERIAL. CHINA IS NOT TAKING ANY OF THIS ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT DOING IT IN STATE IN HER HARDLY. ANY OF IT IN STATE. SO WHAT IS OUR THOUGHT PROCESS IF WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL THIS IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR GOALS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A FACILITY IN A SYSTEM TO HAVE TO PROCESS THAT WITHIN THE STATE. SECURES YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL THERE'S SOME REALLY GOOD LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT WE HAD IT IN ABOUT IN STATE JOBS INCENTIVIZING POLICY TO MAXIMIZE INCURRED IN STATE MANUFACTURING USING RECYCLED MATERIAL SO THAT WAS ADDED TO SECTION FORTY TWO. ZERO FIFTY ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM DART FOR EXAMPLE I HAS TO DO WITH. AT SECONDARY MURPH INFRASTRUCTURE AND I MAY HAVE THE OPTION TO GO VISIT A SECONDARY MURPH. DOWN IN LOS ANGELES THAT IS YOU KNOW DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF COLLECTING. TOOK INVOLVE THE SET THAT GETS MISSED BY THAT FIRST. BY THE BY THE PRIMARY MARKS. ON ME THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT REAL STRONG COLLECTION AND THEN AND THEN CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UTILIZING THAT MATERIAL. AND A LOT OF IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING YOU DO SEE A LOT OF IN STATE MANUFACTURES AND SOME OUT OF STATE THAT ARE DOING REALLY GOOD WORK IN THIS SPACE ALREADY AND I. YOU KNOW I OKAY BYE BYE BUT THE NESTLE LAN NOT TOO LONG AGO AND THEY ARE YOU HAVE WON A PERCENT RECYCLED. YOU KNOW PLASTIC BOTTLES THAT THEY THEY STARTED MANUFACTURING AND THEY'VE GOT OTHER ISSUES BUT YOU KNOW THAT BUT THAT WAS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE. TO SEE SAID SAID THERE THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE IT NEEDS TO GROW WE NEED TO BUILD OUT AND WE DO WANT TO INCENTIVIZE IT HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS OPPORTUNITIES AND- ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RIGHT HERE AT HOME. IN THERE AND THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT THAT SPEAKS TO THAT. BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT WERE REALLY HOPING TO KIND OF. PUSH UP THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION THIS BILL HI AT THE END OF ANY COMMENTS MARK. MADAM CHAIR THROUGH THE CHAIR OF LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION GO AHEAD A AND THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. THAT WE MADE IN OUR TESTIMONY REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FEE IN THE NEED TO GENERATE REVENUE TO PROVIDE FOR THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE UP. AND WITHOUT THAT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT THAT THE THAT. UNDERMINES THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL AND SO. FORTH FOR THOSE REASONS WERE VERY ENCOURAGED THAT THESE AUTHORS HAVE CHOSEN TO. COMMIT TO MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FEE. FOR NEXT YEAR. AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT ADDRESSES YOUR QUESTION. BUT THAT'S THAT'S INTENSE ESSENTIAL COMPONENT. BUT A LOT OF WAYS I FEEL LIKE WITHOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. WAS A WASTE OF TIME. I MEAN WE'RE JUST GOT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA PROCESS HERE. THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING. WE'RE SHIPPING IT TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE GOING TO BURN IT. AND ALL THESE GREENHOUSE GASES ALL THESE EMISSIONS THINGS WERE TALKING. ABOUT GO TO OUT THE- YOU KNOW JUST BY THE WAYSIDE. AREN'T THEY THEY'RE ALMOST TWO HORSES HELPING TO DRIVE THE CAR RIGHT BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY. WITHOUT THESE KINDS OF GOALS AND MANDATES. THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE PART OF OR TRYING TO DO HERE. IS SEND THE MARKET SIGNALS AND THE REGULATORY SIGNALS. THAT WILL HELP TO PUSH EVERYBODY TO START TO TAKE THIS PROBLEMS YEARS BECAUSE YOUR APPS YOU RIGHT RIGHT NOW. ALL THIS STUFF IS JUST GETTING IT'S A GAME A TREE EYES. AND TALK AND SENT OFF TO ASIA INCINERATED IT'S GOING SENT TO OUR LANDFILLS. IT'S GETTING IT'S ENDING UP IN A RIVERS AND STREAMS. AND WORLD DURING THE COST OF THAT RIGHT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SPENDING HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST ON LITTER CLEAN UP ALONE. THE RATES ARE ABOUT TO GO OUT BECAUSE THE BOMBS FALLING DOWN THE HALLWAYS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I AND SO IT'S OUR TAXPAYERS IT. IN OUR REPAIRS THAT ARE GONNA BE BEARING THE BURDEN OF OUR INACTION. AB SO THEY CAN I DON'T CARRY CYCLE ONCE RESPOND TO WHAT YOU MEANT. YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BUT- RIGHT NOW IN THE FEES. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT THESE FEES CAN BE CURRENTLY WITHIN THIS BILL RIGHT. I KNOW WE HAVE NOT SAID A- A FEE SCHEDULE WHAT WAS IT. ABOUT TWENTY SIX IS THE LIMIT. THERE ARE THERE THERE'S NOT A- NUMERICAL LIMIT. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE SAY THERE'S NO LIMIT BECAUSE- AGAIN. ONCE THE BILL IS PASSED IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM RIGHT AND WHEN WE DO THAT. THE BURDEN IS ON THE DEPARTMENT. TO IMPLEMENT IN A WAY THAT IS THE LEAST BIRDS IMPOSSIBLE AND THAT INCLUDES THE FEE STRUCTURE. SO WE ARE GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW WE PRODUCE REGULATIONS AND THAT IS. PART AND PARCEL OF HOW. WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THOSE RULES SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT'S WHY AWAY ALL. REVIEWS ARE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IN THE LEAST BURDENSOME. WAY POSSIBLE. SO AGAIN AND ALSO TO JUST ADD THAT THAT FEE. IS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE COST OF. MANAGING THE PROGRAM. SO I DON'T ANTICIPATE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW THE WAY STE. THE ENTIRE FEE THESE ARE ALL. VERY HIGH TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ONLY MANAGING THE PROGRAM. BUT WE'RE PROVIDING MARK INCENTIVES AND PAYMENTS FOR THOSE FEES ARE HIGHER. THIS FEE IS NOT GONNA. AS DRAFTED DOES NOT INCLUDE THOSE OTHER TYPES OF. PROGRAMMATIC ACTIVITY. USUALLY WHEN WE VOTE ON FEES LIKE THIS. THERE'S A- A NUMBER THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THERE'S A THERE'S A SET OF NUMBERS THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENCIES AND SAY HEY. FOR THIS PRICE WERE DOING X. Y. AND Z. I DON'T SEE THAT HERE. SO WE'RE GONNA JUST MAKE A BLANKET VOTE. TO JUST WILL ALLOW FEES TO BE INCREASE AT CUT BY FRANKLY THE WILL OF CAL RECYCLE. INTEL YOU GUYS GET THE- THE MONEY YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. I GUESS THE CLOSEST ANALOGY WOULD BE. IN ANY PR PROGRAM WHEN WE IMPLEMENT ANY PR PROGRAM. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRED THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION TO COVER THE STATE'S COST OF RUNNING. THAT PROGRAM THAT WOULD INCLUDE. REVIEWING THEIR PLAN RIGHT AND- ADDRESSING ENFORCEMENT ETCETERA. SO I GUESS WOULD BE ANALOGOUS TO THAT SO WE WOULD DETERMINE WHAT THE COSTS ARE JUST TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD SAID. I APPRECIATE THE CENTER TAKE THE SONG BECAUSE THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE BUT I MEAN AB THIRTY TWO WAS MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES AND IT WAS HERE BEFORE I GOT HERE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE SUCH A BIG ISSUE IT WAS ALSO WE TOOK TIME WE TOOK A COUPLE YEARS TO DO IS A GOOD THING IN A BEING A TO YOUR BILL. SO SOME OF THESE ISSUES LIKE THIS I THERE'S CLEARLY A LOT LEFT OUT HERE TO BE DISCUSSED AND WORKED OUT. YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD TURN IT INTO A TO YOUR BILL I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I CERTAINLY. APPRECIATE THE TIME A CONCERN FOR CENTER IN PROCEDURE YEAH. I APPRECIATE THAT SOME MEMBER. ONE THING I MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE APPROVE. THAT THE SYSTEM THEY SET UP WITH A PRICE THE FEES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND SO THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO WIN THERE. AND THE WHOLE THING IS TETHERED UNDER PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX. THAT REALLY DOES LIMIT THE. EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN. ON YEAH. THESE THESE SORTS OF FEES BUT- THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY WITH REGARDS TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS IN A TWO THIRTY TWO. IS THAT. MAYBE THIRTY TWO WAS ADDRESSING A TRULY GLOBAL PROBLEM. THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AS WELL BUT IT'S ALSO VERY MUCH A LOCAL PROBLEM. AND IT'S HARD TO KIND OF PUT YOUR FINGER ON DIRECT COSTS TO CITIES AND TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS. WITH REGARDS TO GLOBAL WARMING. I WHEN A. B. THIRTY TWO WAS. WAS I WAS PASSED. WE CAN. DROP A LIST OF. HOW MUCH YOUR CONSTITUENTS STAND TO LOSE. IF WE DON'T ACT ON THIS PROBLEM RIGHT NOW TODAY IN REAL DOLLARS. IT REAL DOLLARS THAT IMPACTS CITY BUDGETS REAL DOLLARS AN IMPACT. YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I'M MISTER MATHIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THE AGAIN I MEAN THIS IS SIT HERE AND I THINK BACK TO AB THIRTY TWO I THINK BACK TO THINGS WE'VE DONE WITH THE WATER BOARD I THINK TWO THINGS WE'VE DONE EVEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WE HEAR THE SAME ARGUMENTS. MEMBERS EVERY YEAR THERE'S ALWAYS THIS URGENCY OF WE HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN YOU REALLY DIG INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THIS. WE'RE GIVING THE AUTHORITY. TO CAL RECYCLE. THAT'S THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE IS MEMBERS ME AND YOU COULD SAY. YOU KNOW THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS SO YOU WANT. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO WEIGH IN. AND THEY'RE GONNA SIDE WITH CALORIE CYCLE OVER US. THERE'S VETO POWER THERE'S ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT COME INTO PLAY. WE DEAL WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND. I MEAN SENATOR YOU YOU CALL IT IN POWER IN THEM BUT THE WHERE WHERE I COME FROM WE CALL THAT BIG GOVERNMENT AND GIVEN AWAY POWER. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CALL IT GOALS I CALL IT MANDATES. THE THESE THINGS. NEED TO TAKE TIME IT'S OUR JOB. AS LEGISLATURE'S TO TAKE THAT TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EASE ALL SIDES OF IT WE HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY THERE WAS PEOPLE THAT WERE IN FAVOR GROUPS THAT WERE IN FAVOR NEWMAN MITCH CAME NOW THEY'RE NOT IN FAVOR. YOU GOT THIS BACK AND FORTH. WITH THIS BILL. THAT I THINK THE UNITING MISTER FLOORS RIGHT I THINK WE TOOK THIS IS THE TO YOUR PROCESS. THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO AND REALLY IRON IT OUT. WE CAN MAKE THIS A LOT BETTER THAN IT IS AND I KNOW THE ARGUMENT BACK TO THAT IS GOING TO BE DON'T LET THE PERFECT. GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD. BUT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS AT STAKE HERE. THE PROCESS THE MANUFACTURING HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS GO TOGETHER A LOT OF THIS CAME UP BECAUSE THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA WHICH WERE NOW STARTING TO SEE AN END TO. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN. AND I MEAN. WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD THERE'S ABILITIES TO REIN IT IN THERE'S ABILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO ADAPT TO THIS THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT THE TECHNOLOGY IS HUGE BUT YOU CAN'T FORCE FED IT. TO THEM. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEN. EVERYWHERE ELSE IS WHEN CALIFORNIA FORCE VISIT TO INDUSTRY INDUSTRY LEAFS EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. SO. I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO DIAL IT BACK I REALLY NEED TO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS IN MEMBERS A I ASK OF YOU WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO THIS HOLD BACK LET'S TAKE. THE EXTRA YEAR AND LET'S GET THIS RIDE.

THANK YOU Là MISTER ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION HAN. YOU KNOW OUR ANY ISSUE WAS RAISED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. AND ARE I SUPPOSE I WAS JUST GONNA SAY TO FOLKS THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE WE ARE ALREADY HAVING INDUSTRY STEP UP ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT CERTAINLY TO ATTRACT CERTAIN MARKETS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THIS IS SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING IT. THE MARKET NEED TO LIVE OF KNOWLEDGE TO PUSH US MORE IN THAT DIRECTION HI THE VIRGIN PLASTIC THAT HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF SO MUCH OF OUR PACKAGING IS SO DAMAGING AND SO COSTLY IN THE LONG TERM FOR ALL OF US IN FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AS RATE PAYERS AS TAXPAYERS AND AS- HUMAN BEINGS. BUT THERE IS TECHNOLOGY THERE IT'S RIGHT THERE IT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP THIS REMINDS ME OF THE EXAMPLE OF LOS ANGELES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE AVERAGE KID WAS GOING UP WITH HALF OF THE LUNG CAPACITY OF KIDS GOING UP IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HOW TERRIBLE OUR SMOG WAS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THERE WERE SOME CARS ON THE MARKET THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POLLUTING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR THE SMOG PROBLEM AND YET THEY WERE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE AND THERE'S WASN'T ENOUGH INCENTIVE TO GET THOSE OUT ON THE MARKET. AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE GOVERNMENT STEPPED UP AND SAID LOOK YOU GOT TO DO BETTER ON THE- STREET THEY KICKED AND SCREAMED. THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT. BUT THERE WERE INNOVATORS IN THAT MARKET THEY'RE INNOVATORS IN THAT INDUSTRY WHO STEPPED UP GOT THOSE CARS ON THE ROAD. AND NOW WE HAVE DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN LA AND BETTER QUALITY. EVEN THOUGH I'M STILL DRIVING AROUND IN CARS. HI AND SO IT THERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. IT EXISTS TODAY. WE KNOW WE CAN SCALE THIS. WE KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. AND IF WE DON'T ACT. SOON WE WILL CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON A CRISIS THAT IS DROWNING. OUR CITIES. DROWNING OUR RIVERS AND STREAMS. AND OUR CHILDREN AND I. THINK THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. FOR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP. HI WE WORK REALLY HARD TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE ARE. WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING SO MANY DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. TO ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL CRISIS AND BUT ALSO A LOCAL CRISIS THAT IS IMPACTING EVERYONE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TODAY.
