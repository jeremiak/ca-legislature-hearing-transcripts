thank you all of you for joining us. Before we get into some opening remarks our first panel we want to be able to say thank you to humble state for allowing us to be here and let's give the agents you round of applause. I thank you so much. We want to say thank you to all of our panelists who have traveled far and wide to be able to join us today we want to say thank you to the gentleman to my right. Tom west lose a chief consultant for their joint committee on fisheries and aquaculture round of applause for Mr Wessel please. In on behalf of the joint committee on fisheries and aquaculture we welcome you to our hearing on fisheries in offshore wind development. My name is Mike McGuire and I'm honored to be the be the chair of the joint committee and I really do appreciate all of you taking time out of your busy schedules. To be able to be here today we are bringing out some additional chairs we have a full house and we're grateful for that. And we welcome you to the edge of the humble bay in those who are watchin are streaming broadcasts here about California's burgeoning Pacific after when industry. And how it's emerging is a critical component of our fight against climate change. And while this industry will be an important source of power in the golden state's energy portfolio. It's equally important I think that we can all agree equally important to protect the golden state's fishery in wildlife resources where offshore wind turbines would be located. Our focus today being the joint committee on fisheries and aquaculture is simple. California needs to ensure this new green energy source does not harm our fisheries wildlife and the local economy that depends on a thriving natural resource. And as you all know California has been a leader in this nation by establishing an ambitious a bold goal of relying entirely on zero emission energy for its electricity by. Twenty forty five governor Jerry Brown signed a senator daily own bill mandating the electricity target in early September. Two thousand eighteen he also issued an executive order calling for a statewide a statewide carbon neutrality meaning California removes is much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as admits by. Twenty forty five the Los specific requires that 50% of the golden state's electricity to be powered by renewable sources by. 202560% by twenty thirty while calling for a bold path forward 1100% zero carbon electricity by. Twenty forty five and I think that most of us in this room. I know I do support this initiative and we wanted knowledge the hard work of the redwood coast energy authority RC a has been advancing -- And have been statewide leaders focus on offshore wind we have some commissioners were here today we want to acknowledge him and say thank you for all their work. And we also need to expedite the work of the task force that was created by the federal and state governments to put meat on the bone when it comes to rules and regulations. To protect fishing grounds and our coastal environment where turbines would be located. In many cases turbines would be place. Where there are high winds? Those high winds owns also coincide with up weld waters. These waters have high levels of nutrients which mean there are high levels of food sources which means there are robust fisheries and marine life in the same locations were potential turbines would be located. We also need rules and regulations for the large electric connector cables connecting the turbines with the grade would be laid out on the sea floor. And address the ongoing maintenance and operations that would potentially impact fishing grounds insensitive ocean habitat. California has to get this right we will get this right and it's time to involve the stake holders on a statewide regulatory process you're gonna hear from the C. E. C.. As well was born that they have launched a series of community hearings up and down the state. For us today we need to be a start button that meet under the bone. Our number one goal of today's hearing is to hear from all of you Andy start formalizing the regulatory process. We have an all star lineup of panelists. And I'm so appreciative that they all made it out here today and we're gonna ask each of our panelists bill to keep it within our five minute testimony window we have a pretty tight window here today. As there is another meeting coming in this afternoon that we're gonna have to be able to make room. For I would like to be able to introduce at this time some the dignitaries were here today and thank them for joining us. From this from the Humboldt County Board of supervisors we have supervisor fennel and Wilson if you could please give them a round of applause. Thank you so much supervisors would be. From the arcade city council we have councilmember Winkler here today thank you so much as to regret for joining us. Representing I don't work county ladies and gentlemen we have a harbor commissioner here thank you so much you commissioner Brian stone who is here today think as much as you stone. From the Ferndale city council we have councilmember or work thank you so much for joining us. From the humble bay harbor recreation district we have Mister Coleman here today thank you so much for joining us. We want to take a moment to say thank you to the hard work of congressman Jerd half me he is one hell of an advocate for the north coast. And he is lucky to be able to have miss Imerina Mr Driskell working on his behalf here on the north coast we want to welcome both of them to the meeting today thank you so much. Speaking of hard working advocates we are so grateful that his family member would has been our partner of the 200% of the way on this important issue. And representing some member what here today we have Aaron dot and welcoming. Also from humble bay harbor recreation district where what we would like to be a welcome Mister Richard Marx to the meeting. In finally ladies and gentleman representing the McKinley bill community service district we have Mister mail here today thank you so much and it's for joining us. So everyone should receive an agenda and I'd like to be -- Briefly go over the agenda and then get straight into our first panel. Our first panel. Made up of individual agency representatives we're grateful that -- We're gonna have bone here today with the California energy commission the California natural resource agency as well as the California coastal commission represented our agency panel focusing on all issues of offshore wind. Our second panel is going to be focusing on mitigating potential environmental impacts -- A as well as hearing from the industry itself we're going to be having the we have printable power here today we have humbled state who will be. Focusing on the local projects and we have represented is an American wind energy association. Coming up on our third panel we do have environmental leaders. From the redwood region the Audubon society Surfrider foundation and of course the natural resources defense council we'll Le√≥n round out the hearing hearing. From humble fisheries the fishermen in the fleet represent will have representatives from the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's association the humble fisherman's marking association. As well as the exact director from responsible offshore development alliance this is a well rounded hearing trying to be able to provide equal time for a diverse set of voices and of course. We're gonna open up the microphone to all of you under public comment again thank you for joining us and now we'd like to be able to introduce our first speaker here today on our first panel. She is the chief renewable energy -- Pacific region -- Officer from the bureau of ocean energy management we're very grateful that miss sue might is here today so Mike thank you so much for coming up to the hearing. We're happy that you're here she's gonna be providing us an overview of the federal perspective and then we'll go to miss when. Providing us with the state perspective without further ado let's open up our first panel you have five minutes I'll give you a thirty second pop welcome. The morning if you don't like to sit near -- Button and you were looking for the green button you're on good morning and thank you senator McGuire and I'm pleased to appear before you today to discuss the bureau of ocean energy management or bone for short -- Our wind energy planning process and our current status so my name is nessie so might and I am the chief of the renewable energy section for bonus specific region. Covering California Oregon Washington in Hawaii. In recognition of the role renewable energy can play in independence and supporting economic growth. Bone has been working to advance renewable energy to an expanded and targeted leasing program on both the Atlantic and Pacific coast. To date bonus conducted a competitive wind energy lease sales for areas off short at landing coast consisting of fifteen active commercial wind energy leases. Off shore Delaware Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New York North Carolina Rhode Island in Virginia. It's fully developed these leases could generate more and enough energy to power about six point five million homes. Bones in the planning stages to identify additional potentially serious offshore California Hawaii New York New Jersey North Carolina and South Carolina. The potential demand for offshore wind energy on the Pacific coast has never been greater. With California's target of by. Twenty forty five so pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the state and establishment of a bone California inter governmental renewable energy task force. At the request of former governor Jerry Brown. Balm is been working with the state of California industry and other ocean users since October of twenty sixteen to help to identify areas that may be suitable for future offshore wind development. Bones renewable energies leasing strategy is founded on a process that requires extensive planning and analysis. Partnerships with state stakeholders and other governmental agencies. Bombs renewable energy program occurs in four distinct phases. We have a planning and analysis face. Leasing site assessment and construction and operations. In California we're at the early phase of the process in the planning and analysis face. During this phase we seek to identify suitable areas for wind energy leasing consideration. Through collaborative consultative and analytical process sees that engage stakeholders tribes and state and federal agencies. Bom recently issued a call for information on the nation. On October nineteenth. Twenty eighteen one three call areas one on the north coast into into central coast. Received over one hundred comments and fourteen companies submitted nomination of interest in leasing for all three call areas. The comments the nominations received are now posted on a bomb website. So the next stage of our process is called the identification. Bono use the information it received and the call to inform my decision to offer all or part of the call area for commercial wind leasing. Palmer will identify wind energy areas. If we determine that that there are areas appropriate for leasing consideration. Palmer then initiate a formal environmental review of these areas under the national environmental policy act for potential lease issuance. So throughout the entire process including early planning leasing and then review of less C. plans. Mon strives to engage stakeholders who might be impacted by potential activity including fishermen. Is out region interaction is conducted through meetings workshops soliciting stakeholder's input into projects citing best management practices. And research and monitoring measures. Monning partnership with the state led by the California energy commission and the California ocean protection council. Convened a series of meetings during twenty seventeen and twenty eighteen during this outrage approximately eighty meetings were held with numerous stake holders. Including eighteen meetings with fissures and fishing organizations in crescent city. Eureka Moro bay port Saint Louis Santa Barbara Sacramento and San Clemente. Primary concerns identified by the fishing community were. Potential loss of fishing grounds. Gear entanglement mitigation measures used by the officer wind industry. And loss of income. Results of this out which are included in the offshore wind energy planning out reach summary report that is also available and bombs website. And they were considered during the development of the three call area. Going forward we will use the feedback we receive from the call. And other data gathered to compile and analyzed available fisheries information. To generate a special depiction of important harvest areas off shore in the north and central coast. Regions. Data that will be included in this analysis include fishing vessel tracks commercial and recreational landings. Log book data an ethnographic information. Specific to potential impacts on fishing. At least areas identified and awarded to a company. Ball may include appropriate measures to address fisheries and wildlife concerns in the lease instrument. For example in the Atlantic bone has required lessees to develop a fisheries communications plan for use in communicating with fisheries stakeholders. I'm also develops and fines and manages scientific research to inform assessments. And provide a foundation for sound science based policy decisions that help bill manage offshore energy in an environmentally. And economically responsible manner. That is and bone continues to work with its partners and stakeholders. To further refine its initial analysis so that all potential impacts. Both positive and negative may be understood. Completed an ongoing studies informing renewable energy offshore California are also posted on our website. Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee links to several documents have been related to the bone process and the California activities have been provided to committee staff. And I believe that they will be posted on the committee's website to provide additional background -- As always Mambalam is glad to provide any additional information that the committee may request thank you thank you so much thank you for your testimony we're gonna hold questions until the end. For our entire panel to be able to speak we now would like to better turn it over to miss when representing the California energy commission to be able to give us a first hand look. Of the agency whose partner in the state agency is partnering with the federal agency is when the floor is yours you have five minutes welcome. Thank you a good morning chairman choir thank you for holding this hearing and inviting me to participate. My name is look when when I'm a policy adviser for commissioner Karen Douglas at the end California energy commission. The energy commission as California's primary energy policy and planning agency we work closely with state and federal agencies utilities and other stakeholders to develop and implement. State energy policies. California has a long history of strong leadership an ambitious initiative to fight climate change and promote clean energy. We've set high goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions calling for reduction to nineteen ninety levels by. levels by twenty thirty an 80% below nineteen ninety levels by. Twenty fifty one of California's core strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is I. renewable portfolio standard. Which that's targets for the percent of energy sold to customers that must come from renewable energy. The initial target was 20% by twenty seventeen but it has increased several times and is now 50% by. Twenty twenty six and 60% by. Twenty thirty as you mentioned earlier in addition to these targets California also have the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by. Twenty forty five so we are on track to meet our energy and climate goals in two thousand sixteen we met our greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. For twenty twenty and renewable energy currently serves 32% of our energy demand. Over the last ten or more years the energy commission has had an active role in planning for different renewable energy technologies in different parts of the state. Some examples of these planning efforts that we've been involved in are the doesn't renewable energy conservation plan. And the San Joaquin Valley least conflicts fuller project. The desert renewable energy conservation plan as a landscape scale planning effort. That conserves and manages plant and wildlife communities in the desert regions of California while facilitating the timely permitting of compatible renewable energy projects. The San Joaquin Valley least conflicts fuller project with the stakeholder led process that helps identify more than four hundred thirty thousand acres of land. Most appropriate for solar Peavey development in the San Joaquin Valley. And analyze the transmission capacity available to print to bring Peavey generation on to the existing grad. Both of these planning efforts were highly collaborative and data driven. They emphasize public outreach and engagement throughout this planning processes. It's important when looking at complex levels of planning efforts to coordinate with all of the agencies who will have a role in those efforts. Are planning efforts have involved is working closely with both state and federal agencies. In past efforts we will we've worked closely with the bureau of land management and the department of defense. And now we're working closely with bomb on planning for offshore wind in California. The energy commission has taken a lead role in coordinating the state's participation in the task force. In this coordination role we work closely with state and local agencies such as the ocean protection council. The California coastal commission the department of fish and wildlife the California public utilities commission and the governor's office of planning and research. The task force has been active for almost three years during that time our priorities have been to better understand the potential constraints on offer wind. They called out Richard engagement information and data gathering. And to identify research opportunities. As bill mentioned with our state and federal agency partners we've held over AT outreach meetings and webinars. And on the north coast alone we held meetings in Eureka crescent city Trinidad and blue lake with stakeholders such as the fishing community environmental NGOs the native American tribes. And the public. Last year we also held in integrated energy policy report workshop in arcade it to hear about and discuss. The north coast regional challenges opportunities and solutions to meet California's climate and clean energy goals. The offshore wind resource along the north coast some of the best in the world. Transmission is one challenge that exist in the north coast. However the potential call area from north north coast in size for local need avoiding some of those transmission constraints. Offshore wind has real potential to support our climate renewable energy goals. Have the generation profile that complement fuller. It can utilize existing on shore transmission infrastructure and it promotes clean jobs and investment. Given the potential value of the renewable resource and the parts of the ocean and coastal environment to Californians and the local communities. We believe that it is important to continue improving our understanding of the potential constraints on offer wind through our planning efforts and continued out returning cater to stake holders. So thank you very much for your time and I'm happy to answer any questions you have for the panel at the ends. His mistress when very grateful you're here these are generally now like to turn the hearing over to Mister potter Mister Parker is a program manager -- In is overseen marine renewable energy he's with the ocean protection council so we've heard with the C. E. C. who works directly on all issues with -- Bone now Mister potter and then we're also can hear from I doctor coverage will be focusing on impacts potential impacts on the ground in what could be mitigated and or avoided. To return the floor over now to Mister potter represent the ocean protection council the floor is yours. If I center McGuire -- In thank you for this opportunity to provide testimony today -- Next slide please. Great I'm so they'll see her the ocean protection councils a cabinet level state agency. That is charged with protecting conserving. And maintaining California's ocean and marine resources. For the benefit of current and future generations we work at the intersection of science policy and management in four ways. Taking down silos and coordinating efforts with partners inside and outside of government. Insuring best available science informs policy and management decisions. Recommending actions to the governor and the legislature to protect ocean and coastal ecosystems and finally finding catalytic an innovative -- Projects to advance scientific understanding and improving ocean hell. Next slide please. Great -- So the OPC has a long history of working on marine renewable energy issues in two thousand six it established a state federal. Marine renewable energy working group to address the uncertainties in the regulatory process. In the information needs of agencies and stakeholders. In December twenty eleven the OPC adopted a resolution specifically addressing marine renewable energy. Among other things the resolution acknowledge that wave title now sure win energy may help California meet its long term energy. And carbon reduction goals create new jobs. Diversify the state's energy supplies and reduce air pollution from fossil fuel power generation. In addition it directs the a PC to work with the California energy commission on marine renewable energy policy development initiatives. The OPC worked with the federal bureau of ocean energy management and energy commission and watching the inter governmental renewable energy task force in. Twenty sixteen under the auspices of the task force over the last two and half years we help plan and conduct outreach to the public fishermen tribes. Vinyl groups and other stakeholders to share information and have discussions around potential offshore wind energy development on the north and central coast. We're planning additional north coast out reach to fishing communities later this year. And early. Twenty twenty the OPC wants to ensure. That marine renewable energy projects minimize impacts to coastal and marine environment and the state agencies have sufficient information to and data to carry out their planning and regulatory responsibilities. Relative to marine renewable energy development. Consequently we're funding studies at UC Santa Cruz UC Berkeley humble state university. Then investigate the range of potential impacts to the marine coastal and terrestrial environments that would result from marine renewable energy development. The development of these studies study concepts has resulted from close consultation with state and federal agencies research institutions and stake holders. Currently we're working with very closely with the department of fish and wildlife energy commission coast commission. Ball -- And humbled stay in developing a study. That will investigate the potential impact of fishermen from offshore wind development on the north and central coast. The PC strategic plan. For twenty nineteen twenty twenty four includes an objective to minimize impacts to the coastal marine environment. Recreation and fishing communities resulting from rain renewable energy development. Attached to the subject of our for actions never one to collaborate with research institutions to develop and fund studies and projects. That investigate. The environmental impacts of deploying an operating marine renewable energy technologies. To collaborate with bone in the energy commission I. priorities and operation of the inter governmental task force. Three continue convening the California marine renewable energy working group. And for provide information to stakeholders on the permitting process for marine renewable projects through. Workshops legislative hearings webinars and written materials. As the bone leasing process for offshore wind development on the north and central coast rolls out over the next several years the a BC will continue to look for opportunities. To engage in scientific research out reach marine we noble and J. planning and policy development. Last slide. So this is my contact information I would encourage folks to contact me get away I I and to so we just discuss what's on their mind. I really appreciate this opportunity to provide testimony today they stop miss Parker thank you so much for joining us for grateful you're here will have some questions -- After we hear from Dr bridge she's a senior environmental scientists with California coast commission we appreciate your presence here today the floor is yours you have five minutes. Thank you very much. I can get my presentation appear at thank you so much for having me today and again my name is Kate talk a bridge I'm a senior environmental scientists with the California coastal commission -- And if you could just skip to the second slide -- And I'll just continue talking until they show up -- So as part most of you are probably aware the California coastal commission is charged with regulating development on the coastal zone to ensure the protection of coastal resources as required by the coastal act. Now the coastal act when we're thinking about offshore wind the call select as a couple key policies that will be focused on as we review -- Offshore wind development -- Offshore California and those first two policies I want to talk to I think really aligned closely with the goals in charge of this committee so I wanted to highlight those. The first is a protection of marine resources which include species habitats and water quality. And the second is a protection of fishing which includes both recreational and commercial fishing. In addition to those policies because like include separate policies protecting public access and recreation -- Minimum minimization of impacts to navigation and hazards -- Protection of coastal public views and protection of tribal and cultural resources next slide please [inaudible] So. These projects are strewn projects are incredibly complex and they span a wide you know -- G. R. right geographic area and go through many jurisdictions so I created this very crude -- Diagram just to kind of walk through it. So. As we've been talking about in California were really contemplating offshore wind turbines out in federal waters that's really the purview of the federal government through bone. Does the power from those turbines will be connected through cables that go through both federal waters through state waters and then we'll connect on shore once they reach on shore they'll connected to our existing grid -- Now as part of an overall offshore wind project there may be components on shore such as upgrades to our transmission system or upgrades at the port to facilitate construction of wind turbines. And that's all part of the the picture here. Now the coastal commission is unique I think I think among federal and state agencies and that we have a regulatory role in all of these areas. So out in federal waters we have federal consistency authority and we'll be reviewing offshore wind at two different points one prior to the lease sale. And one as we get further down the line and we're looking at projects specific proposals. In state waters the commission has direct permitting authorities will we will be providing a coastal development permit for any cables that need to be installed. On shore -- Depending on where the connection or the developments that that is proposed a curse the commission either has direct permanence already or in the case where a local government or a port has permanent thirty into the coastal lacked. Most of those projects as energy projects are then appealable to the coastal commission. So because the commission will be reviewing these projects in their entirety in some way and I think that's important to point out -- Next slide please. So what are we doing to address Impacts to California's fisheries and wildlife -- And the first thing I sort of want to point out there is our is our general approach -- The goal is to avoid impacts as much as possible -- If they if impacts can be avoided we want to minimize and then fully mitigate those impacts and I just want to make that really clear and the way that that's accomplished now in the planning process is to cite. Lease areas and eventual projects in locations that accomplish those goals -- And that's really what were we're working on the mitigation discussion is critical but we're not there yet we're still working on that try to avoid and minimize impacts. I will get to mitigation a little bit further down the line at least the specifics of what that might look like. So. I'm not gonna go to too much detail on the activities going on because you've heard that from the other panelists but we're working with our state and federal agency partners to collect and analyze data both existing data. Collect new data through studies We are working to develop a thorough and transparent regulatory process -- And then it as but has been mentioned a lot of time and efforts been put into stakeholder outreach and collaboration and that will be ongoing. Next slide please. So just before I conclude I want to focus on sort of our big next step and commission staff is really focused on preparing. For a federal consistency determination that will occur prior to the lease sale and we have been actively working with bom and all the other state federal agencies to ensure that we have adequate information. To conduct that review. I want to highlight this because I think this is the way the store one regulatory opportunity for the state and stakeholders and the public to weigh in on the leasing and citing discussion. That's going on within a public hearing setting so -- We will be looking for input from all of you and from agencies and anybody who would like to have input -- Once that we go through that phase and will be moving on to really focusing on the development of medication -- And monitoring strategies as we move forward an officer went. So but that'll conclude thank you. Thank you so much for really grateful would like to be able Ted just ask a few questions and we'll bring up our next panel here. I appreciate all of you again for being here [inaudible] I'm -- Talk about the ideal date when we're gonna see these studies back. And how you're going to be a to bring them together. Can you give us a brief synopsis about [inaudible] What each? At universities looking at in where you think our focus needs to be yeah I I can predict what should be a little bit -- In them mark separates here he can talk a bit more in detail what we're finding at humble state but if you. Essentially they did that the three primary projects that we're funding right now. We'll have results -- Within a year's time frame and they will be in our own products. That will -- That will be delivered to the state -- In the timing is such that that we think will note certainly help the cost commission for instance with its consistency -- Determination and and with some of the planning that will be no. Rolling out appears well. So are you gonna go over. Yeah so well -- Leave the humble state so. Sure but okay so the the the study that were funny at humbled is -- You just briefly go over that exam so everyone okay great so basically be looking at the the impacts to the marine environment -- The cost on firemen a look at some of the the port side issues -- It also be looking at I mean you know. Yeah impacts in humble bay itself perfect and they were funny as study yet humble I'm sorry at Berkeley that -- Looks at the potential work force -- Ramping up in California for after wind industry and then we're also funding -- A great integration analysis. And we're still working on the scope of of those two studies but and we anticipate having that. That done probably within the next couple weeks and then something that that is not related Josh sure wind is to study at UC Santa Cruz was just looking at the potential -- For title energy along the California coast. Tile yeah -- High it's actually broader than that it's the whole suite a marine kinetic it's not only title. I'm sorry ma'am what we're gonna have yeah I'm just waiting -- To a Republican I know ma'am so we have a we compromise with you if you just want to write it down and I will make sure we ask the question if that's okay with you. And we're actually right you get assistance with that -- In if you don't I just read your question and we'll get right up. Thank you. Which part or anything else no that's I think that's it okay thank you so much -- Talk to us about. What? On the international -- Side we've seen. Several countries. Aggressively go after offshore wind energy. Can you talk to us about. Lessons learned -- In what California should avoid -- From other nations advancing wind energy open the panel and I'm gonna start with calls commission. So I think I have a it's probably a better question for either Bowman energy commission I think they've been a little bit more engaged on the international front I will say. That we look forward to you too understanding what kind of process sees that was set up internationally that worked and didn't work -- And the data they collected and what information did they used to make these decisions now are optional environment is not the same as either the east coast or internationally so it's not a direct. Link -- But it part of it is for me at least is understanding which process sees were put in place like for engagement -- With different communities or collection of environmental data But I think we're still in the process at least I am of figuring that out and what it. Which ones work too much Winston. When we go to bone anything that we especially want to avoid -- That may not have worked that way -- They actually thought would in anything any model rules and regulations that you think -- The west should be advancing. I'm I thinks certainly we need to learn from those in Europe involvement is international affairs office is engaged with that the various European countries that have developed offshore wind and we have agreements with them to try. To periodically have -- Updates and what they're doing and learn about you know lessons learned a lot of it primarily or though on fixed foundations right now. So -- You know floating foundation is up and coming and Wilk will begin to see that become more majority -- And will continue to have those dialogues with our international partners and to the extent that we can bring that at the state level and we certainly would would be willing to do that. But we are engaging with our European partners to learn -- What's been done there and what didn't work or what would work as it would apply to California so going forward would be interested in. Noble will -- Bring that down to the state that's great. Twenty yes though -- Offshore wind as an advanced -- Are much more mature industry in Europe The energy commission does have memorandums of understanding with both Denmark and Scotland. That we completed in a two thousand eighteen and so we're looking forward to working with those countries to kind of learn from them as to what they've done with their projects -- As they continue to monitor those parties that have been sold what they're seeing in terms of the data. In terms of you know I'm that production is coming from there Offer wind turbines -- You know any other issues that they're experiencing what they did to get those projects completed -- Any medications they had with fishermen and other communities and so we've already kicked off the initial steps to learning from them. We had a meeting in September -- Of last year with. A federal agencies and Denmark and Scott wanted I set up Bates have a basis for learning from them and how we could do an information exchange. And when you expect that to be a coming back to this to the energy commission into this year. As far as the lessons learned that they would not repeat except for when would that when would you be able. To speak to that -- So it's I mean I don't know if there's a certain time frame as to when they'll get us information back What I think our next step is to meet with stakeholders in this off shore? When planning out for and identify key questions that we need to ask them -- You know and provide those that those questions to Denmark and Scotland -- I think they're willing and ready to provide us with any information that they can. We just need to identify what areas that were most concerned with or misleading information. Thank you please part Just. One I think that to the the conversation the eight from the limited exposure I've had -- To the European -- Into after wind industry is the these seem to have developed a fair amount of technology around monitoring which we could definitely use it blind here [inaudible] It's great. There's been a lot of discussion about timeline throughout the state -- That we may be seen turbines by ex date. Phyllis in -- For California when you think that we would actually see. That -- If you will. Constructing on land and installing offshore what is your got -- Certainly we are in the initial phase of the process we have not even identified wind energy areas let alone potential lease areas so we still need to environmental. And that and then issue a lease if all the planets line up and we actually had a lease sale. Mid to late twenty twenty the at least does not guarantee or provide authorization to construct it simply gives the let's see the ability to further characterized. And the ocean and and do some Mike reciting and prepares engineering report. And when they have all of the information on their facility design in complete detail so that we can do and environmental analysis and Andy I. S. level. And that's the only time and it would take them a few years to put that together -- And then only after approval of those plans can they begin to construct. So -- It's a multi year process if you know if we had late last season by twenty twenty eight could be. You know and don't quote me on this but twenty twenty five yeah the time frame again very rough right yeah so it's it's a multi year process and there's plenty of time for engagement and you know. That's a lot of things have to happen before then. Thank you. Talking about fisheries so I wanna go to the doctor there so you talked about were not even. I'm going to paraphrase -- Were not even at the point to start talk about mitigation we are focusing on avoidance. So when it comes to avoiding impacts when with fisheries and especially how challenge California fisheries have been. Over these past four years. What are you looking -- To to be able to avoid those impacts. I don't think we'll be able to avoid all impacts to fishing I just I think everybody in this room understands that's not a likely. Outcome -- Given how broad on the fishing resources are in California especially here in the north coast. So. The point what we're trying to do now is gather information which is a difficult task -- The to give us an understanding of where those resources are and how we can minimize the impacts of those this is. It's actually quite -- Complex process we've been working with local fishing organizations here in the north coast in individual fishermen -- To develop a process that everybody can buy into both the agencies but and the fishing community. So that the results is -- Again up process that everybody is. Working together towards and the product that everybody can buy into and when I see a product when I mean is a discussion of what fishing resources are. And then a discussion about how do we cite offshore winds in these areas so that those impacts are minimized -- The mitigation discussion is a critical component of that I don't wanna make it sound like we're not thinking about that because we most certainly are. But the specifics of what that might look like I think it's for just that's what we're not quite. We haven't quite gone down that road yet -- We're still working with the fishing communities to try to develop the impacts. So. It's weird missus might about -- Very rough -- And we are not holder to this time Mike right but I'm just can use an example let's just say we're looking at putting something in in twenty twenty five just as an example. I wanna make sure that folks are leading understanding the state side about the rules and regulations and how that process coincides with a hard date. After release is been issued and actually being able to see someone bill something off shore. What do folks need to know about the rules the regulations and how those would be adopted and what is that process look like Please. I'm so I can speak to the coastal commission process -- And and again as I mentioned on my side we have a regulatory role here -- Especially on the federal portions of the project which is the which I think is critical -- So and that happens it to look. Two time frames the first is prior to the lease sale as you Heard Mr made mention -- They are going to be doing an environmental analysis on prior to the lease sale will be developing a documents -- But before they go to the lease sale they will submit -- A federal consistency determination to the coastal commission at that point the calls commission will review The least areas of the proposed lease areas and our intent at that point is to do sort of a broad siding scale analysis about what the potential impacts. From when development would be. On those from those proposed lease areas -- And as I mentioned that's an important. Time for everybody here to plug into the state process -- Once if we get past that phase as as again we you heard there's a process where the developers and collect additional data develop their projects more extensively They will develop a plan and go to them for approval of those plans those plans also need to come through the coastal commission for federal consistency review so we will be reviewing the specifics. Of now we would give me where the turbines are located and what the specific we can actually get to the nitty gritty of an impact analysis so that's the other and now is there open regulatory process in front of the coastal commission -- So that's another entry from from the federal side. There's also that initially what on it is that a parallel effort with the feds date that you would be launching. Please talk yeah so it is it is in partnership with the federal government it's a process that's described in the coastal zone management act and the coastal commission implements that. Law for the state of California And so it's and this is how it was done in the in the other states that have done offshore wind or even offshore oil and gas so. It's it is a well established process will be working with the federal government specifically with bom. To make sure that we get all the information we need to do that review -- When we get down to the project specific phase will be working with individual projects proponents as well -- To get all the details of the project so we can review it and of course lacked It's great [inaudible] Spot. I would also mention that you know there's a role of course for the state lands commission in the cables that would come on shore and in you know. In. Leasing for those purposes. In the state lands commission -- As the authority over bay bottom and leases I'm so. So how many you a state agencies would you C. involved in the permitting -- On at the state level the cause commission when I have a burning action state lands would likely have a permitting action -- And city of CDW would have a would also likely have a permitting action and then but that's and that's for the state waters component there are potential on shore components that than having even broader array. Of regulatory needs so for looking at porn improvements that brings in a whole other -- Set of local and state agencies and federal agencies as well that will have action so -- It's a lot of folks that are going to win and wait wait in on these projects. Thank you this went. And while -- So some other agencies to consider while they won't have a permitting role in offshore wind will have -- Regulatory or an exploratory wellness of California and the system operator as well the case as well as the California public utilities commission. And we have included them in our broader efforts around offshore winds. Thank you so much. Any closing comments that you all would like to be able to make -- At this time before we transition to our next panel or any items that out we may have forgotten to ask. Hearing C.. Nine all right thank you so much for your time we're very grateful -- There's gonna be some follows from this panel that we'd like to be able when we advance our second hearing one of the follow ups will have his. Lessons learned I'm especially on the environmental side and fishery protection side and we'd like to be a follow up on those PC -- Studies they're being Vance at universities and make sure that you have the latest information we'd like to be to say thank you to our first panel very much just give them around clasp. We're not gonna be transitioning to our industry panel the focus of our industry panels how offshore wind projects can mitigate mitigate potential environmental impacts at C.. And we're gonna be hearing from The industry we have Kevin banister here today he's fight vice president development for principal power -- Representing the home team we haven't sever here today senior research engineer from humble state university at the shots energy research center who's been front and center on these discussions. We also Danielle mills who's here today she's a director with the American wind energy association based here in California -- As each of those panelists are making their way we're gonna ask to be a switch out the name takes thank you so much to Carlene and to take J. for all the work on that. We'd like to be a welcome the chairperson of the board of supervisors who is here today Mr rex bone thank you so much supervisor bone for joining us as well. I. as our panelists are taking a seat we want to say thank you to our media services team here from the California State Senate thank you so much to Dana in to fill for all their hard work. And our surgeons who are here today Jeremiah in the Roy. So ladies and gentlemen we now would like to be able to welcome our industry panel. To the hearing we're really grateful that the three of you were here we're gonna start out with Mister Bannister he's a vice president of Alvin it principal power. Eight you have five minutes Sir we welcome you to humble county. I will thank you at as Senate requiring and really I honor to be here so thanks for providing personal power to testify -- As said the center said my name is Kevin banister and I'm vice president of development for prince will power. I which means that I'm responsible for the development of our company's global pipeline of projects -- And opportunities but what we're working on here in California -- Is especially close to our hearts -- And that's especially because we're a California company -- And that we've you hear humble county as some. A place that with investment could become the shore side hub for offshore wind appointments up and down. The west coast -- I guess more importantly it's always a pleasure to be here in Eureka I mean it's a pleasure that said this morning the fog did not interrupt -- My travel schedule as it has many times the past so really happy to have gotten here on time -- We're an offshore wind services and technology company that offers the floating foundation solution to developers. I utilities and independent power producers around the world And while we have established offices in Europe and are engaged in significant activities in Asia. The technology itself was born here in California where were headquartered -- At one could say that the technology has been raised in Europe -- Where today we have three projects totalling one hundred megawatts of capacity under construction? Or a it our in advanced stages of development -- These projects will come on line in Portugal Scotland in France in twenty nineteen twenty twenty and twenty twenty one respectively These projects either are or will be project financed meeting that that commercial that providers which tends to be very conservative money -- Have had their questions about technical status in performance satisfactorily answered. This along with progress from other our friends in the industry like Ecuador -- If I. folks have heard of Ecuador and their high when technology which has deployed thirty nine what project off shore Scotland -- Demonstrates that floating wind really has arrived as a viable and important opportunity to meet renewable energy goals. Indeed there are gigawatts thousands of megawatts of projects dependent on floating when foundations under planning and development around the world. In California -- The opportunities immense projects have already been proposed for the central north coast of the state. And a recent report produced by the American jobs project projects the Anderson could employ over seventeen thousand people and provide close to twenty gig watch of capacity to the grid. By the twenty forties previous reports from the national renewable energy laboratory and rail -- Have projected similar numbers so it's clear that offshore wind is a high capacity product. Producing energy in a way and at times that is complementary to the solar resource in the state And that carries the potential to generate significant new economic activity and jobs in humble county is one of the areas that we believe could benefit the most. It's also an emission free and environmentally friendly resource. And is therefore become an important part of national planning globally. To address climate change but for California to benefit from the tremendous promise the industry presents. There are important considerations that should be addressed to proactively. Among the most important is the interaction between floating offshore wind farms and the traditional historical and present users of the ocean space. In many places along the California coast commercial fishing is deeply significant from both economic and cultural perspectives. The knowledge in honoring the meaning for all that the free to play is of genuine importance -- As new activity in the ocean are proposed. And this is why principal power Guided by the partnership that we have with the redwood coast energy authority RCA -- Along with the D. P. R. knack for solutions I prioritized aground up approach deciding our proposed project here. Consulting with local fishing interests and other stakeholders. And ultimately signing in M. O. U. with a humble fisheries marketing association to ensure that we as a project proponents are held to account to the principles of collaboration that we think. Leads to better project development and better outcomes. Generally. At the site that we identified after consultation is about twenty five miles off shore and just for reference. We know that other offshore wind developers in California feel and act the same way castle in for example has worked hard to build its relationship with fishing interest in the Morrell bay area. Aberration in cooperation of this nature is paramount. So California should continue to engage with stakeholders invested in the ocean space. The state should seek to provide developers and stakeholders with as broad an array of options for development as possible so that from them. The best part sites can be considered and if appropriate. Developed. This includes continuing dialogue with the department of defense for example. To pursue science based analysis around areas that should and in some cases should not be open to development. This also includes analysis and action around the benefits that avail from investments in port. Or transmission infrastructure. But because offshore wind excuse me but because all because waters off shore California. Get deep quickly floating solutions are required -- These technologies advanced to the Have been removed now we need to take advantage of the sighting flexibility floating foundation's offer serve California schools. To conclude the opportunity presented California by actually does large so are the challenges to maximize the industry's potential and the benefits that it can provide to the state and nation. The urgency to address these issues is also large and we stand ready to assess. Two is to assist the committee in its deliberations -- And to provide other information very happy to participate in a question answer period after my testimony thank you again for the opportunity to testify today. Thank you so much Mister minister for joining us we will hold questions until each of our presenters were very grateful for the here we want to say thank you so much Mister Severi who's a senior research engineer at charts energy research center. But he really has been here on the ground working it -- In working with the state on all issues -- Avoids how we can avoid impacts to the environment wildlife and fisheries ring turn for over to you Sir we welcome you have five minutes. Thank you Sir Mike McGuire I appreciate the opportunity to ask by the testimony today -- So I believe I have a presentation all just let that come up -- After one complaint important part in California's clean energy future and can help meet this help the state meet its target of a 100% clean renewable energy. By. Twenty forty five Bob Sherman resource in California and in particular on the north coast is one of the best in the continental US. With average wind speeds exceeding ten meters per second in some locations. California's north north coast has a strong opportunity proffer when development. Because of the support Sir Superbowl when resource. Existing deepwater port infrastructure in Humboldt Bay and limited overlap with US military operations. However there are several challenges to development. These include electric transmission constraints part of the structure requirements. Stapler concerns environmental impacts. And geological or geologic or seismic issues in your powerpoint is up and running where. Thank just like find print okay perfect -- Besides energy research center at Humboldt state university is working on feasibility analysis to quantify the opportunities for energy and economic development. And also understand the challenges impacts and constraints of officer one development on the north coast. Next slide please. At the start center we're working on three projects one of which is been funded and the other two have been proposed and are pending funds. The products -- Over one your time line -- Beginning this spring. Results and outcomes will be disseminated by winter and spring of twenty twenty I'll briefly describe the scope and status of each of the three project proposals. The first project looks at the when resource generation profile and transmission constraints this project has been proposed to the bureau of ocean energy management. As pending funding the product will look at the following tasks first. The resource assessment will be used to evaluate the wind speed resource and calculate the potential energy generation profile from different wind farm scales locations on the north coast. Second we'll be looking at the great compatibility which will evaluate the like trickle transmission capacity to connect offshore wind into the regional grad. Transmission capacity is very limited and I'm all county and significant upgrades will likely be required props or when development this task will partner with. Pacific gas -- An electric our local utility to run a power flow transmission model and estimate the required infrastructure upgrade classic costs. For different one farm scales. Next this project will be looking at the ad -- Subsea cable. To determine the options and feasibility first I've C. cable to transmit power from let's centers -- From from wind farms and on the north coast to Los centers in the San Francisco Bay Area -- Lastly we'll. Conduct an economic analysis to develop a bottom up cost model to calculate the cost for offshore wind energy for different development skills in this region. Next there is a project that evaluates the concerns surrounding offshore wind development this is a multi disciplinary project has been awarded and funded through. The California ocean protection council. This project includes four task as described their ingrained. First the environmental impact task. This will analyze the likely and potential environmental impacts to birds marine mammals fish. Ben thank armor organisms and other relevant species we're working with ecological consultants HD Harbin associates to complete this analysis. Second will be looking at coastal infrastructure this task will assess current conditions of coastal infrastructure including the port and harbour and described anticipated upgrades Wilk required. To serve an offshore wind industry Mike McDonald an engineering consulting firm with expertise not for one important event development will be assisting with this work. Next we'll be looking at stakeholder engagement to identify stakeholder benefits and concerns and termin approaches to address these. Issues stakeholders including commercial and recreational fishing community environmental organizations developers regulators labor unions and others. Lastly this project will include a policy analysis to evaluate environmental permitting processes. And energy policy related to offshore wind at local state and federal levels. This portion of the work of a strong focus and energy polity in energy policy. To understand the complex pathway and time lines and a great officer went to St electricity markets. Lastly the third project looks it looks at some additional considerations props or when development. This product has been proposed to the California governor's office of planning and research. And is pending funding. The product is looking at three men issues first military mission compatibility this task will investigate how development officer went on the north coast can be done in a way that is compatible compatible. With military operations in northern California. Next. There was -- Task looking at the geologic and seismic concerns. The staff will assess the geological seismic issues associated with C. four anchors anchoring and in particular bill also look at the issues with horizontal directional drilling for cable and fall into the bay. Lastly there will be -- Subsea cable environmental analysis which will conduct a preliminary environment out of my mental analysis of a sub C. transmission line including impacts of benthic organisms and other marine life and go systems. Next slide please. Where the beginning of a feasibility analyses rocks or wind in the short time available today I'm able to describe our our work at at at a high level but I'm not able to go into that much detail? You're welcome to ask any questions about any piece this now sister followed by email. With more information our contact information shown here. For me and then also for the principal investigator Arne Jacobsen. Arnie is the director of the shot that is a research center and he was on fortune and able to be here because he's traveling internationally for other work. You can look at our centers website for more information and for interim per reports and deliverables that will be published there when they're complete. Thank you again center McGuire for your time here today and I appreciate the opportunity to find this testimony thank you so much we're very grateful Sir in will be essence of questions you're just a bit. We are appreciative that Daniel mills is here she's with American wind energy association based here in California we welcome you miss mills a committee you have five minutes to floors horse. Thank you senator exposure to be here today and really appreciate you welcoming us to this beautiful community on this lovely day yeah -- I'm Daniel mills with the American wind energy association of California a ouija is the US trade association that represents the wind industry -- And our member companies are global leaders in utility scale wind energy technologies were interested in delivering the benefits of utility scale wins both onshore. And offshore to Californians -- American when power was born in California roughly around the same years me -- And after wind energy is the future -- We I. Californian our member companies are applying the lessons that we learned from our experiences with lance bass wind -- As well as our experiences on the east coast with offshore winds. To the California market to make sure that California after wind starts off on the right foot -- And in a manner that maximizes the value that it brings to California. At one of those lessons is that it's really critical to collaborate early with environmental and other stakeholders -- And often throughout the process of development -- And it's clear that officer wind energy is coming to California companies are hiring and watching the market for signals of stability and opportunities for growth. That opportunity is enormous -- Kevin mentioned the the job study that -- Explained that over seventeen thousand jobs could come to California -- If we maximize the potential opportunity and see about eighteen gigawatts of development off the coast that's an enormous number and if we're going to get to a significant -- Market like that we need to make sure that every step of the way we're checking in with critical stakeholders we'll be interacting with these projects on a day to day basis -- So we have to start with the best projects in the best places and make sure that we get it right with our eyes and scaling up. After wind has potential to revitalize port communities like Eureka -- And to bring manufacturing to the stake state and California is very well positioned to tap into that potential -- Given the 1100% clean energy policies that we have -- And our carbon neutral goal. On the east coast after wind continues to advance advance -- Improving economies and through robust strict state policies that have recently been signed into law by a bipartisan group of governors so. Leaders in Massachusetts Rhode Island Connecticut New York New Jersey and Maryland have all made and Virginia also have all made very substantial offshore wind commitments. And we expect offshore wind to continue to mirror they M. Costa claims that we've seen with land based went throughout the country. We know that after winds can complement California's generation and low profile so Kevin also mentions a as did look plan I believe the the complementary nature between wind and solar in the state so as we move. To higher penetrations of renewable energy We know that the seller is very predictable it comes off line around. Six o'clock PM roughly when the sun is setting that is exactly the time where offshore wind resources are ramping up and started to pull the hardest. Those resources can continue to blow throughout the throughout the evening and through the night which can help us charge our electric vehicle fleets California also has very. Aggressive -- Electrification targets and can also help with night time heating loads in the building and industry sector. So there's enormous pop opportunity for D. carbonization her as well -- We also know the officer wind can have a capacity factor between sixty and 70% based on what we've seen in European markets. Roughly what that means is that you see -- Just as a sense of scale coal and natural gas have capacity factors of 5455% -- Throughout the US so essentially officer wind will be generating more of the time and some of those conventional resources it can have enormous D. carbonization benefits -- And we know that it's also -- It's also I'm going to bring those jobs to the state as well. But in order to get there we know that collaboration is going to be key so I'm gonna talk about three different areas where. We is collaborating and individual companies as well -- To make sure that we're doing this responsibly. The officer winds industry we know and through the work that we've done with the department of defense can enhance national security. And is compatible with military operations and readiness -- We know that adding energy a pendant independence in an office or a home grown energy source like off her wins. Can help reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources and enhance our national security -- And and we've seen this undulating bayside -- We're ready to work with the department of defense we're doing so in Washington DC include as well as the Coast Guard and the navy -- We're finding workable project citing locations -- We also know that we can co exist with the commercial and recreational fishing industries and diverse Diversify and strength in the U. S. maritime economy we're seeing that through individual company efforts like what Kevin mentioned -- And engaging as well and some of the ongoing studies that are happening. With the offshore projects on the east coast like block island And we've also learned a great deal from our work with the environmental groups who within we partner on the American wind and wildlife institute -- This is a partnership of industry leaders agencies and conservation groups that work together to insure and facilitate the timely development renewable energy. Excuse me at develop -- Projects responsibly without affecting wildlife with habitat. Excuse my voice -- So in conclusion -- We're really grateful for this I think we have seen that California is already following best practices by having this meeting relief there no projects online we have a really great chance to get this right. And we look forward to working with you in the future. Thank you so much miss bills were very grateful into our panel I would like to be a sort of a some questions -- First of all I would like to be able to go -- To the shots energy center for so [inaudible] Talk about. In your beliefs so there's been some discussion about ten when Turbines off of the humble coaxed. So what type of upgrades you see may be needed if you can just walk us through that. In how many megawatts would that be is at a hundred make watch just just give us a an overview if you don't mind -- Yes so if there were ten megawatts of a typical sized -- People are looking at is maybe ten to twelve megawatts per turbine so that would be around a hundred two hundred twenty megawatts for for that particular farm -- As Daniel mention with a sixty or producing out most -- We'll need to get the details about how much energy the precinct I guess. Will be required in several places not only the port but also in particular transmission upgrades I don't believe that humble county is great has the capacity to absorb. A hundred or even fifty additional megawatts of electricity -- Right now so significant upgrades will be required either in that overland transmission lines going east to the to the interstate five corridor or potentially going south. Along existing utility right away as so will be significant electricity transmission upgrades but then also significant part development will be required both -- To due the assembly but also on going on operations and maintenance of the of the Germans. So since every or an expansion so have how has that price break down. Or in the investment break down Happened in other regions so can you give us -- In rural areas whether it's on the east coast or internationally -- That we need to be able to increase the capacity for transmission. How was that -- Investment breakdown taken hold. Who pays for it? What's a good question -- And certainly it's it's relevant to offer when developing in California -- All right. As well as I'd certainly implied anyway in the and by the previous panel -- It is done differently in different places and where we've seen offshore wind take hold. Sort of first -- Really in northern Europe so maybe and you know Denmark and the Netherlands and even in the U. K. Germany. In these places generally what's happened is that at the central government has -- Has actually provided access to transition to the project developer and that's the and it's incorporated it's not a part of what that what they what the what the developer including the cost that the consumer sees for those projects so it's something that. Obviously it's seen either through taxes or through through a like a feed in tariff type arrangement but so the developer it's taken care of by by somebody else. So transmission or denies or for example sure signs can paraphrase here so let's just say we're gonna have -- Ten off the humble cooks -- Again just I. prophetical ten off the the coast hundred hundred twenty make a whites. It may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to be able to create it to be able to expand. The capacity for those transmission lines in some areas in northern Europe. The the government has paid for the upgrade of transmission lines while the private industry Contractor has installed the turbine turbines and the cantor cables is that accurate. I'm oversimplifying yeah yeah. You know I think from our perspective we think that sent for the project here and humbled we think that -- There may be some ways that we can avoid the major upgrades -- That would result in a you know in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars of costs for an initial project -- I think you fear summarize that situation well though yeah do you want to talk about those about some ways to be able to mitigate that the cost C. if you don't mind -- Well for I I'm not really qualified to talk about sort of the transmission sort of wrap around that we might be able to achieve here and I. in humble county transmission as you may know is it. Like an almost impossibly complex -- Area -- Seven that's that that's that's just tough one for me I'm gonna add that as a follow up okay so will -- Talk about [inaudible] Lessons learned. Internationally. So we're asking the last panel about lessons learned especially when it comes to fisheries and the environment. So what we what measures have been deployed by both private industry as well as government to be able -- To have compatible uses. Allow the fleet to continue to operate as well as have the renewable energy can either three of you talk about that all. Not all at once. I don't have the I don't have the global perspective from Europe I think -- California has had a lot of experiences the previous panel explained with -- You know making sure that we're minimizing impacts for a variety of different technologies and been doing it for hydro power for a long time so there are a lot of different lessons that we can use. And apply from other technologies as well that is other parts of the country but I don't have the information on environmental issues globally. Thank you can follow Please -- I I also have more of a a local focus here but I think I'd say that one thing -- That that could be a lesson learned from the east coast is states setting -- Targets for offshore wind development helps give the industry both a vision of how they're moving forward but also give the state some ability to plan ahead a probe really ball for transmission but also for environmental concerns. The environmental studies. The enviro study that you're dancing now shots [inaudible] How? How will be able to overlap for example the central coast or is it? More just focus on the north coast fill us in on that. This will also be very focused on the north coast we're gonna be looking specifically at two separate areas one of those is the bomb call area and one of them is further south of Cape Mendocino that I was really super wind speeds. Within that area and and just around that we're gonna be looking at population seasonal patterns of migration what type of birds fish marine mammals are there and these are gonna be very specific to the region and the unique -- Ecosystems we have up here so I think maybe some of the results and methods maybe transferable to different regions but I think it to be very focused on understanding one of the potential impacts. The other two cities have yet to be funded let's just say you kick off tomorrow are you today talking twelve twenty four months how long would it take you D. thing to be a complete. These are all twelve month projects -- We're hoping and expecting that -- The other two will be beginning within a month or two and we still expect -- Be heading deadline so five next spring or for results yeah reports in would you describe the studies as initial -- Or you will you need to be able to go back to be to do further review after what you find from this these studies that you're launching now. I think different tasks have will have different levels of detail so for example when we're looking at a subsea cable for long distance transmission that's gonna be a very high level because it's a preliminary thing nothing similar it's been done on the west coast. But other aspects of the study such as the transmission. Integration will be will be detailed and be pretty -- Final. What was that hi aspect about? Would like to be to just talk about -- The floating turbines can you just. Give us thirty thousand foot view of what the time line for construction is off shore -- In what that would look like this so that we have a a visual leaving here today -- I don't know if. Every Mister Bannister yeah sure it M. and an old also just give a quick description of what our technology looks like just just to help people visualize so basically -- Our technology recalled the wind flowed there are three columns that and if you look at it from above effectively form any collateral triangle -- I just circular columns -- Upon one of those columns we have fixed the wind turbine and the ideas that we fix the wind turbine in a protected environment. Of the harbor and then we tow out that fully assembled unit to the project site and at the project site we would have pre deployed -- The mooring and what's called the export cable so the cable that actually brings the power to shore. I saw the operation is what happens all at shore with the exception of the toe out. And then the connection of the mooring lines of the cables so each of these systems will have one morning line that extends off of each of the column so total of three mooring lines -- For each wind turbine -- The foundation itself -- Our team has a from sometime ago has history in oil and gas -- That the foundation is called a semi submersible that's that's sort of the type of foundation it is. This type of foundation I'm has been deployed in places like the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea for decades and decades so there's a lot of experience with this type of foundation. What we're talking about is much much smaller than this sort of the Gulf of Mexico you know enormous like oil? Type of type of systems -- So the construction window -- Can be fairly compressed -- Because we're not reliance on heavy lift operations offshore like you would see -- For what we would call a conventional or bottom fixed offshore wind project where. You know you have a foundation you pile it into the C. bad and then you bring out the whole you know that on a on a vessel you bring out. The tower than a cell the blades then you have to lift that all the way up to what's called the hub height which may be. You know three hundred three hundred fifty feet above the sea surface we do all that work at shore so the offshore works. Are much much simpler with flooding systems like ours so it hundred megawatt projects. That's you know it is confined to some to the to open whether windows we it's difficult can be difficult to be out there in January doing this type of work But in the you know scholars from April through October -- Depending on the consultations that we have with especially the environmental at stake holders and also fishing interests what times are open for those types of activities. It would take two seasons I would imagine -- So you know maybe one summer then another summer to deploy the full. One hundred megawatts -- I think you as the industry matures here in California that will be compressed further as we all you know we learn from learn by doing and get better at it. Got it in you talked about jobs talk with us about permanent jobs one time our temper if you will in the construction phase so. Go through that if you if you don't mind Spencer -- Certainly there construction phase jobs and then there's I went M. at jobs -- Which are for you know for the life of the project and I think one of the things that is quite compelling we're seeing it now in the on shore -- Wind world where a lot of that the turbines and towers that are you know placed on shore now being recommissioned in repowered. And with floating -- Foundation technologies like ours that opportunity exists to do the same so maybe a project has a twenty or twenty five your life. You can tell the foundation back to shore. Replace the turbine the turbine in this case is the sensitive piece of equipment that has shorter life. Then the foundation itself so there is there is the opportunity not to for that for that sort of one time work of of construction the ongoing work of operation and maintenance and then there will be opportunities. For we think for re powering -- Existing projects but we also see that the opportunity in California so large when we're talking about twenty gigawatts. By the twenty forties twenty forties is only twenty you know twenty something years from now That is that that's a lot of work to be done. So they may be one time jobs ask for a particular project but we do use to see the potential -- For projects to be developed in ultimately constructed in parallel. Thank you so much miss mills. We have seen this on Le√≥n bay side as well there right now thirteen manufacturing facilities in California that support. Land based wind -- And wind turbine technician training programs within the state that You know that go out and service turbines throughout the country So if we see you know a robust wind resource in New Mexico or Wyoming they can go there you can do the same thing with offshore winds -- There's also you know I think this is why -- Keeping our eyes on a a larger target is really helpful because that's what will actually bring the supply chain into California earlier in the process so that we can get some of these parts. Manufactured in California and then you know if we get to a point where there's additional development throughout the Pacific be exporting some of those parts -- Throughout. The world. Thank you so much would like to be to see if there's any closing comments and I like to be added to our follow ups as well including comments for either the three of you will start with miss mills and work our way to the left. Since no I just I encourage you to continue to lean on us as a resource and we'd like to interact with a lot of the important stake holders who are here today and moving forward to make sure that we do this right. Thank you thank you so much suffering. I look for the opportunity to present some of our result after we've gotten into the studies will but further every great you have as four think so much Spanish. I would just say that there are several lessons that we are bringing from Europe -- Some of them are you kind of down in the details you know at the things about cable protection systems that -- That will make the cables last one which means that you have to deploy them less frequently. I would say the floating foundations themselves in some ways our lesson learned from Europe -- We C. significantly reduced risk -- And in fact so significantly reduced environmental impact when using floating foundation so we deploy. Pretty conventional offshore anchors that are entirely removable as opposed to doing piling into the C. bad which not entirely but is a very pretty pretty common practice. For the bottom six foundations and we know that. Those you know that since severe sort of acoustic signature that comes with that piling is really detrimental for marine mammals in particular so with floating foundations there's there's you know less impact in the deployment and installation phase. And then perhaps the greatest benefit there's been a lot of discussion about where we are in this part in this practice now is avoidance you know trying to avoid harm. Flown foundations give you greater opportunity to do that because you can't. You're not dependent so much on what the C. bad conditions are or how deep the water is you can go to the place where first maybe where the wind is good. But also maybe the first place that you go is where you know the a variety of stakeholders say this is where we think you should go in the wind resources sufficient to enable an economic projects so it provides. A tremendous amount of flexibility that that's really valuable. Andy so much really appreciate your time if you can please give a round of applause for industry panel thank. As we move forward in our Jim that we want to say thank you to all of you for hanging with us we're gonna be moving into the environmental perspective. Our next panel is title protecting our ocean environment in balancing the need for green energy perspectives from environmental leaders we are grateful that we're gonna have to check -- Can here today he's With the redwood region Audubon society Jennifer savage she is a proud humble resident and she's now the PO California policy manager for the Surfrider foundation. And we have seen deals worth your to date with the natural resources defense council. Ladies and gentleman. We're grateful for all of their work. We are going to then hear from the fleet -- In giving us their perspective from California's fishermen we're gonna have checked here to the left then Jennifer and insane D. All right. I got a plays Janet thank you so much for joining us were really grateful that the three of you are here. Hi thank you for your hard work each of you have five minutes I'll give you a thirty second prompted for getting close we're gonna step is start with Mr Hogan who is with the Audubon society welcome Sir in providing the environmental perspective. Thank you Mister McGuire -- I'm glad to be here thank you for everyone for attending. Tom. All right about chapter along with California Audubon. Is committed to sustainable not hard to carbon energy sources when being one sold beer not being another. Hi to power partial power has its -- The dams and salmon migration and pollute water pollution. So we're not not considering that all. Our Richard beach reason Audubon chapter our purpose. We advocate for protection of birds and wildlife by supporting conservation efforts to protect wildlife and their habitats. Our mission is to promote a wise balance and responsible and ethical use of natural ecosystems on our local national and global scale. And protect the biotic and abiotic components of local national. And global natural systems -- Scope of our chapter covers all of bill nor Kumble county. And adjacent areas of Siskiyou county of medicine -- County and western Trinity county -- Personally I graduated from mobile C. numbers in nineteen seventy with a degree in biology. And after graduation went to work for the for service in southern California -- Working in fire control and then and prescribed burning research -- With the experiment station down in Glendora -- After a four year stint with the US army at the Walter Reed army institute of research in Washington DC. I returned back up normal state university because is a good place to raise a to this area to raise a family where I I began working for read the sciences lab on there -- Actually first on a silviculture project which got disbanded. And then -- Millie picked up by a wildlife project -- In nineteen eighty three and ever since nineteen eighty three until my retirement. Two thousand eleven I worked as a as a wildlife biologist -- I've been involved with them with the Audubon since -- Nineteen nineteen eighty seven in nineteen ninety eight a spirited effort. To get Hubble they complex. Included in the western hills for shore bird reserve network. And that was as a intern as a almost as an international site. And that was just recently upgrade this year. To a hemispheric side -- Very little is known about the bird component do we have off shore out here -- Its it's too far out for regular studies -- Doctor stand Harris -- One thousand or follow G. instructor emeritus mumble sting overstate. Has compiled notes going back -- To nineteen forties and through his stern studies and research both sort of gone off shore have compiled some information on the US pieces we have offshore -- There are at least forty species that utilize the offshore waters off of California -- And I want To I want to highlight a couple of local let me first start Maria -- Including that now was a floating platform your increase in in. Causing a marine ecology area you're you're you're creating a platform with two which allergy will attach -- You'll get invertebrates then are collecting around those -- The LG and fish moving it around those -- Around those two so you're you're creating a a micro environment -- And I'm sure the fisheries people will be addressing that further -- We have a number of pelagic species it -- Such as albatross is. Sure waters petrels -- Cruise the waters off shore. The strong westerlies we have -- Pick up close because new channel willing along the coast that new trend up willing brings a lot of there's a lot of new trenches. To the area -- Providing a lot of food for Bates -- Big fish and then you see these. Long winged narrow long wings -- Oceanic birds. Cruising those water there they are getting left from wind shear. Off of the water soon most of the time they're going to be. Broadly just soaring -- Looking for looking for opportunities but so you figure that once you get to an area where you have -- An offshore structure could be an oil well it could be a piece of of flotsam -- Where you have organisms attached to it creating a small environment -- Gonna get small fish with that and the and potentially -- Balls of bait fish. In which these sure waters -- Or not just cruising flap over a water maybe -- Three meters ten feet high but or circling and soaring high. To spot these big fishing and diving down -- To to get there early to get our food. Thirty seconds okay -- When I go to a to the US slides in please? What a particular you particularly of dress black Brant -- Along the coast here -- Black -- Humble they were the seal grass is very important to to the block. To the Pacific black Brant -- Yeah is they futility they feed on the rest of the band they migrate between Alaska peninsula. And Baja California networks are way up the coast. To humble pan further on north of to the Puget Sound. And then -- My great -- Mike a from future sound up to the Alaska peninsula. And even up -- To up to champ Kamchatka peninsula. You see out. That they're bringing up in the office -- Yours was. In the arctic -- Concern about the black rat population is it's a lot of not a lot is known about. Some of their water ecology and so on the we have about a hundred and fifty thousand black Brant Pacific brand in this area here -- And that's about limit -- Counting those each year up in Alaska peninsula before they migrate south. To allow -- A hunting limit each year based on those numbers -- M. sorry we're gonna have Ted okay great policies would you you have any concluding remarks please. Now thank you no no thank you so much so going to mobile. We took questions will come back with questions on that specific migratory patterns in just a bit okay thank you so much for your presentation. We are grateful that Jennifer savages here she's represent the Surfrider foundation -- In is the California policy manager for the foundation. The floor is yours ma'am. Thank you and good afternoon it's really great to be home and to see so many familiar faces. I Mike from I thank you and I was instructed so well Hey there. Good your J.. I was saying it's great to be home it's great to see so many familiar faces and thank you senator McGuire for holding this forum. And and thank you to the other panelists today it's been really informative so far. In addition to working as Surfrider foundation California policy manager and I'm also a twenty one year resident of humble county has been seventeen of these years. Living in Manila along Humboldt Bay. I'm extremely familiar with the challenges and the benefits of living on the north coast and the pride that we take in our connection to the natural world. I also served on the north coast regional stakeholder group during the marine life protection act implementation process which proved to be a valuable opportunity and privilege really to learn more about our ocean wildlife the concerns of our local fishermen. The complexity of balancing multiple interest. To that end Surfrider NRDC Sierra Club national Audubon society and defenders of wildlife are among the many NGOs that have been tracking and commenting on California's offshore wind energy process as it's been moving along. First and foremost Surfrider foundation always tries to support renewable low impact sources of energy of course I mean that's a no brainer. Breaking free of fossil fuels is a global imperative it's truly the greatest imperative of our time California's commitment to renewable energy is both necessary and admirable. But Bob annual energy is obviously the right thing we still have to do the right things the right way. And that's what the concerns about officer wind energy can men well we supported in concept we remain keenly aware. That as related to our waters the technology is still largely unproven untested launching a project offshore in an area critical to marine life must be done without most Karen preparation. M. as discuss briefly the M. offshore wind farms can harm birds and number of different ways. Electromagnetic fields underwater noises and vibrations can affect orientation and navigational ability. Of our marine mammals one your wind turbine generators produce less sound than older turbines impact of low frequency sound on whales dolphins and other ocean creatures still need to be investigated. Under water support pilings anchoring devices scour protection materials and electromagnetic fields could cross cause an increase or decrease invent the community's ultranationalist vitamins. And possibly a at migration patterns. Loading hit a power cables can lead to entanglement of whales and other marine mammals and there's there's other concerns as well that sandy will be speaking greater details about those and other threats. So I will move on to say. That despite the admirable quantity of meetings that bone in the C. C. have held what we're hearing from community members is the need for improved quality of meetings. Clearly opportunities exist for a more inclusive and transparent process that would ensure site selection reflects environmental and other concerns. Surfrider in our colleague organizations have consistently advocated for a scientifically and stakeholder driven citing process that prioritizes. Environmental sensitivities. Specifically we've asked the state to help secure funding for third party scientific analysis of the data in the database and and the creation of an environmental sensitivity layer. Anteon cyst on a process that such high environmental bar for this new technology in the ocean that is so vital to our economy and our well being. So we were heartened when last November at because the commission meeting representatives of the coastal commission energy commission a state lands commission. Adamantly supported these ask but nearly six months later there's been no follow up. Even today we've heard the phrase looking forward to in regards to figuring out virtually every single detail that needs to happen between now and the actual deployment of the turbines. If we should get so far which is fine and it's appropriate. But it also suggests that building a wind farm out at sea has a lot of challenges yet to be solved. So well we want to increase the promise of offshore wind enthusiastically we definitely need much more information to show that the potential benefits can actually manifest at all. And can do so without harming the birds fish and marine mammals already facing threats. Thank you so much miss savage as a follow up questions here in just a bit. We're not gonna turn over to miss it was worth it representing the natural resources defense council. Says with your five minutes the foreshores thank you. At first like Ted just express my regret that I have to follow John savage. Again I'm sandy Ellsworth with the natural resources defense council and I'm with the energy C. oceans program. I want to thank senator McGuire for hosting. This forum and hearing and also for so whole heartedly embracing the idea right off the bat that. In order to develop offshore wind we need to do it in a way that protects the marine environment and factors and other stakeholder uses. California is a leader in climate change mitigation and marine protections self let's guide with these two principles elevating them both equally we can do at I also just wanted to share that this is the first time I've been -- So far north in California and it was immediately clear driving in yesterday just how special humble bay is. An RTC fully. Recognizes that addressing climate change through dramatic D. carbonization is urgently needed. As such we are of course. Supportive of responsibly cited offshore wind we've been very active in the Atlantic in promoting at and working with developers to ensure that the highest degree of marine protections are upheld. Today I'm going to discuss some of the environmental considerations building on chat and Jen's remarks -- Some of the environmental considerations the Saudis associated with floating offshore wind and I'd also like to highlight some of the science needs. And research priorities that energy C. and other organizations have identified. Can I have the next slide please Great. I briefly highlight some environmental considerations associated with floating offshore wind turbine so hopefully these two images are somewhat instructive. There's concern about habitat loss there's no denying that these turbines will have some sort of benthic foot print they have to attach to the C.. For so where they're placed is very important. They also penetrate all of the water column with very long cables because they use incurring systems. Which is about a fat in some regards. But there is plenty of potential for in all of water interaction with the many cables. There's also concern about secondary entanglement we're very clear on the fact that the mooring lines have a huge circumference. So there's not tremendous concern about primary direct entanglement from marine mammals interacting with those cables. However there is a concern that marine debris and fishing gear could become entangled in. The very many cables within an off shore floating [inaudible] Wind farm. One of the reasons that were so supportive of starting small and then scaling up developments incrementally is to see how these interactions between sea turtles and marine mammals play out with cables. In the field. Citing offshore wind turbines should prioritize avoiding sensitive habitat areas then requiring strong measures to protect wildlife throughout each stage of the development process. And then there should be comprehensive monitoring. Of wildlife and habitat before during and after construction. Following this framework of avoidance. Prioritizing avoidance is essential for responsibly developing offshore wind energy. The next slide please Thanks. And next [inaudible] One thank you. Now I'd like to discuss some of the environmental considerations specific to the humble call area which you'll see up there outlined in yellow. On this side you'll see. Our he said that the outline of the humble call area -- So it's hard to tell from this image but one of the concerns that we have is about the thank the communities. That live on the sea floor I mentioned before that it's going to be important to avoid placing anchors and sensitive habitat. There's limited information about the Ben those of the humble call area. However in twenty sixteen if there was some work -- Using an autonomous underwater vehicle. And that characterized to some of the C. for habitat near the call area. The expedition found twenty species of corals eight species of sponges and eighteen species of fish near the couple humble call area. This observe diversity and density of species demonstrates that a thorough Ben take survey should occur in the call area to identify areas with high levels of diversity. In order to minimize benthic impacts it's also important to note that the call area is situated between two submarine canyons one is your canyon to the south and the other is Trinidad canyon. To the north. Even though we know one minute great thank you very much. One thing to note about the submarine canyons is that they are well documented to service habitats nurseries forage areas refugia in carbon sequenced carbon sequestration and storage areas. It's unknown how development in proximity to these canyons may affect the canyon's ecosystem functions and the services they provide. That's why starting small and monitoring very carefully is critical. Finally it with regard to marine mammals there at least thirty species of marine mammals that live in California coastal waters the wood detailed analysis for only a small number of those occurring in the offshore wind areas. Has been conducted. For many of the species with known distributions the data are not fine enough to make localized. Decisions in a humble call area. There's certainly a need for better data on blue whales and great wealth. Among others I'm sure. To conclude I'm going to underscore some of the key research needs and I can see that my time is up and sell I will really conclude quickly. I'm I wanted to building on what Jennifer mentioned about the importance of prioritizing a robust analysis of the existing information that's in the database and I also wanted to add that having three years of robust baseline data. Has a great potential to actually benefit the offshore wind industry. If you have a in in adequate baseline that could lead to profound delays in the future. Energy C. looks forward to working with the California coastal commission ocean protection council California energy commission and bill meant to ensure. That offshore wind development upholds the highest level of environmental protections thank you thank you so much we're grateful to our pan -- We'd like to be an open up some questions here I would like to be to go -- To miss Ellsworth first so we talked with my energy sees work in the Atlantic -- Is our ongoing monitoring -- Of what you've seen deployed fill us in on that and that's been an issue that wanted that makes that we address today. That's a great question I am not. So here's what I can say about Our work in the Atlantic we were instrumental in developing -- Working with a regional planning process and not is one of the elements of offshore when planning that we seem to be really successful -- For example the Rhode Island -- I'm sure when development. Undertook an extensive planning process in which energy C. was very active and part of that process was identifying important ecological areas so. Some so that offshore wind development was cited with those in mind and as a result the permitting for that project map very quickly -- Another part of our involvement has been working really closely with developers in that protection of the north Atlantic right whale. And after years of negotiations Energy C. into other environmental groups were. Really proud to announce a collaboration with Ben vineyard when where the developer agreed. To certain key mitigation measures cell protecting right wells from the acoustic impacts of geophysical surveys and undertaking. Key construction activities during periods where the wheels were less sensitive. So to summarize about our work in that northeast I would say that -- We've been very involved in both -- Contributing to the science and also -- Advocating strongly to really elevate the scientific. Elevate citing that factors in scientific considerations. You know those mostly floating platforms or they actually drilled and can you just fuller piled on Ben okay there yeah. Right so. In terms of floating. Turbines -- There are there's the project in Scotland and there is no floating project in. The United States right now Connie thank you so much -- For the three of you on going monitoring is an important -- It. Item that you'd like to be a C. dressed. Of both fisheries and wildlife. Yes absolutely I mean with without monitoring we don't know what's happening and so given especially the fact that it's such a new technology and that we don't know how well it will work and what the impacts will be. Monitoring would be critical. Thank you so much miss Ogan so look at humble bays you said in our entire read. Tire north coast region -- It's critical -- For back brand -- Why and -- Also if you could just address that a bit -- And then if you can also just address ongoing monitoring and if you think that is important on one side. Thank you -- Your grass grows throughout the west coast from my canteen. On up most through the whole west coast of North America on up into the Alaska peninsula. Your grass is the primary component -- For forging black Brant -- They migrate down to Baja California and work away up the coast -- In the fall and work your way up to the coast. Through the water time and then Up to their breeding grounds in the north slope of Alaska -- There are no populations of lack of our Pacific Brent there are non migratory seem to be hanging around the a lot Alaska peninsula. And this is a product of global climate change in which so large is now reaching down to the bottoms of the oceans there where the you guys gets enough sunlight to be able to produce energy that they need to live -- I see this is an opportunity with having platforms off shore to be able. To put monitoring devices on these black brown to a large body Berkeley usually Kerio. Real color trance transmitted formation -- As to where they're migrating to wear their marketing from when they're migrating -- Elevation of their migration the callers it'd been developed so far that are being used -- Collect information numbers well they're moving throughout the ocean and then when they get near cell phone cut tower. It downloads information from the last time that that color was -- Downloaded -- Even to even to downloading some information awesome to G. towers off of these species absolutely no thank you and I just made a note of that as well -- For the three of you. What I heard from to view is it's important start I'm paraphrasing here important start formalizing -- The feedback loop -- It especially the closer we get to leases so we may see leases in twenty twenty twenty twenty one right somewhere in that range. And what I'm hearing is that it would be -- For important formalize the feedback loop from stakeholders whether it's environmental organizations fishery groups -- As these leases are getting closer -- To being formalized please jump in. I would say that's absolutely correct and I mean this hearing today has been so instructive in the kind of conversations that we need to be having. And I as I said I think there's a bit of a disconnect -- Where we have on one hand? This you know we're going we have to get like we'd need renewable energy like we absolutely do there's Boston about it -- But there is this sort of pitch to the local community about like we're going to put in the softer wind farm it's going to create a gazillion jobs is going to solve all our problems it's wonderful. And maybe that's all true we don't really have all the information that we need that and yes there's been eighty meetings but a lot of those meetings have been essentially the same thing and it so. You know that it's not like that information is necessarily new or that it's getting to new people or that the and people who are leading have as much of an understanding an overview. About what else is needed I mean I feel like I've learned just like I said so much today I really appreciate this and appreciate the other panelists You have the so in making a feedback loop that is more formal more structured. We can ideally get everybody on the same page which I don't think we are now and again. Like we support renewable energy on just be really clear about we just want. It all to all the information to be up front and available to everybody in the public we need a balanced approach right yeah We can't sacrifice one for the other and by the way the reason why we're moving forward renewable energies at for the planet right and so we have to be able to have -- Forward thinking and mitigation I once we C. deployment please. Short and just setting Ted Jen's comments -- It's really important to note that California has experience in at least -- Elevating environmental considerations and other stakeholder concerned so there was that does renewable energy conservation plan process that went on for over a decade -- And is still in place -- And there it was also the San Joaquin solar siting project wherein. Least conflict areas for development were developed in a six month time frame so I think. Going back to what John just said it seems like there is agreement that the sort of process is necessary one that includes lots of stakeholders one that prioritizes environmental concerns and those of other stakeholders. And so it's getting down to brass tacks and sort of figuring out what who's going to pay for it who's going to convene at and who should participate. But again giving California's experience I think that's eminently doable it just needs to happen and needs to become a priority. Thank you so much we're gonna offer -- Very brief closing comments anything that I may have missed -- Or any items that you would like to be able to advance we'll start to my right worker way dentre let's start with Andy please -- Any closing comments that you'd like to be able to advance briefly. Don't think of anything to add other than -- Again I just really wanted to thank you for advancing this conversation. You so much for being here in super helpful -- In regard to talking about where you've been in the Atlantic as far as energy C. -- And then also how we need to be a formalized process thank you so much please accept. I don't have too much to ask but I would just say that as a long time not because president and somebody who went through that mean like protects not process. And I think that it is very. Clear that when and the state agencies are working on projects in the north coast that they need to make a very. Dedicated and determined effort to understand the particular and unique needs of this area and address them. And I appreciate your efforts in that that world I guess machine thank you so much for being here check. Hi sue this is an opportunity now was. Five or ten years down the road before we really see a developing offshore wind farm. To start doing office do start doing research offshore also these plastics pieces around her finding out getting a bass line and what's out there. And then we'll see -- Once the platforms are established and to be able. To continue that find out. More information on what the speeches are using our current technology cameras and so on like that too check the species and then -- Begin to look at the final results of that. And I think of working with shots energy and their program and now looking at somebody offers pieces is a good chance to also work with them. Thank you so much round of applause for environmental panels they take you so much thank you for your time Grateful. We're trying to get a present a well rounded hearing here today hearing from agencies in the industry the environmental organizations and now were welcoming -- The fleet to be able to come for our last panel Is title California's fisheries and offer winningest energy can win in fish co exist or will the plan flounder -- So we'd like to be able to welcome. I don't know if anyone noticed the pan but you're very welcome On a Friday we are gonna welcome three individuals -- Here to the table -- First and foremost so we're gonna be hearing from Harrison I. Bach is the president of the humble fisherman's marketing association within can hear from no Oppenheim the exact -- Director of the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations and we're really grateful Andy Hawkins is here she's the exact -- Director responsible offshore development alliance so we're gonna start with yours and work our way down to my right -- And we welcome the three to the form thank you so much. For being here try back you have five minutes the floor is yours and give you thirty second prompt. Thank you Sir McGuire. My name is Harrison I. Bach I am the president of humble Fishman's marketing association. The concept of offshore wind energy is not new in other parts of the world. It is not new on the east coast of the United States. But the concept is new to the west coast and especially here in California. What is known as the fact that on the west coast of the United States in a particularly California we have some of the most sustainable fisheries in the world? Here Fishman face many challenges as our fisheries are some of the most highly regulated. With gear restrictions in limited fishing seasons. But notably there also a large amount of areas that are already closed to fishing that exists in this state. We had marine protected areas rock fish conservation areas. Ascential fish habitat. Marine sanctuaries. Scott conservation areas in a wide variety of other areas already closed to fishing. If one were to look at a map it is quite simple to see that the entire state is littered with large areas that are already closed to fishing. These offshore wind energy projects will permanently take away an additional hundreds of square miles of ocean from fishermen as we are unable to fish within these vast areas. This convinces and ships more fishing effort into the ever increasing smaller areas that remain. We is fishermen in this state. Utilize every last bit of these remaining areas. The bottom line is that we cannot afford to lose anymore essential fishing grounds. Fishermen are also worried about a long list of potential and buyer environmental impacts most of which have already been mentioned the previous panel. We understand firsthand how harsh and unforgiving the ocean can be and are concerned about failures with the equipment or even the entire project in general. There's also an element of apprehension about the amount of electricity being generated in its effects on the marine environment. Yup sure win project also raises many safety concerns the proposed site for wind farm in Eureka is going to take away prime fishing grounds that are critical to obtain due to these close. Due to be it being so closer proximity to port. It is also important to retain these local grounds reduce travel time in bad weather that fishermen often face in northern California. They're also navigational concerns here in Eureka fishery must contend with a very dangerous bar to transit to and from the ocean. Increasing the amount of consistent traffic with very large maintenance vessels in a narrow area adds another element of risk to safely pass. Not only the bar but the fleet must also be careful transiting through the wind farm is there will now be many large obstructions we must avoid and Dodge. It will also increase traffic in areas with ships traveling the coast. These are more hazards that a fisherman must face to provide a product that the public desires. Wild sustainably caught seafood is considered to be the absolute best form of seafood on the planet. That we as fishermen strive to make these viable resources available. Yeah it really seems that we are always under attack. Whether it's environmental groups that fight to shut down these fisheries. Or government agencies attempting to take away more fishing grounds. Fishermen are always fighting to defend their livelihoods. The public relies on us to provide a wild sustainable product by means of fishing. And we rely on fishing for survival. Fishermen are not against renewable energy at all. But we are against permanently losing fishing opportunity Thank you. Thank you so much. For a great for now then turn the floor over to known Oppenheim the executive director of the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations now welcome Sir. Thank you chair McGuire it's a pleasure to be here with you. The state of California and the people of the north and the central coast have a lot to be proud of in their commercial fishermen and when it. Our fisheries are among the most sustainable in the world and Fishman work tirelessly to ensure that the public trust resources that you the people right we own. There are the highest quality the revenues from the harvester shared for the public's benefit and their bounty is available to future generations of fishermen and the public for ever. And the economic activity of our members and associates seafood businesses in addition to feeding the state and the world provide a hundred and twenty four thousand eight hundred jobs at last count and over thirty five billion dollars of economic productivity that's in California alone according to a department of commerce. Study clearly fisheries are an important part of our coastal renewable economy in California and threats to these existing jobs in the families they support. Should be free we discuss in forums like this so. Thank you for the opportunity. Our state likewise takes pride its ingenuity and the proactive work that we take to reduce carbon emissions we also take pride in social justice in the equity bill any of our major projects and initiatives. This become of renewed focus of the new some administration in for example the distribution of our scarce water resources. And for that we're grateful it's in the spirit of that of of equity billeted at the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations has been working proactively to defend the rights of our members. And operate -- Imply their craft in the context of wind energy development off shore. The state in the north coast regions -- And the central coast regions are poised to enter the Brave New World of offshore wind energy. If we don't take care if we don't learn from the mistakes made in other parts of the U. S. and other countries we will lose a real opportunity to get this right the first time. Climate change and ocean warming impacts the fisheries have been numerous insignificant already from shifting fish population distributions to closures caused by harmful algal blooms these changes have been unpredictable and sometimes extraordinarily costly even tragic. In addition to these climate impacts regulatory and spatial constraints of severely constrained commercial fisheries costing our members dearly. The impacts the commercial fishing industry resulting from the development of offshore wind resources are likewise numerous insignificant from spatial displacement the gear concentration to business disruption interruption to impacts to safety transit. And logistical impacts to shore side operations. From the fishing industries perspective offshore wind development is equivalent to eminent domain. It's crystal clear to us that the fishing industry that offshore wind area -- Development equates to closed areas. There's been the beneficiaries of these closures will be corporate entities foreign and domestic to sell power to consumers for profit. It's the transfer of assets and resources from one space intensive ocean user group to another in simple this is the set of trade offs like any other eminent domain process. It's a choice for society and for our leaders to make let's make wise choices. It's also clear to us that these call areas beacons being considered here today are just the beginning. Thirty gigawatts of generation and the result and displacement of most commercial fishing activity off our coast appear to be the goal post where could contemplating here today. That's frightening to many. We hear a lot about compensation to fishermen in the in these conversations disruption payments D. impacted businesses will certainly be appropriate down the road. If wind projects and cables are installed in the U. S. easy in our coastal waters we have a lot of work to do first. If offshore wind projects are not appropriate for certain areas of the coast based on impacts of fisheries or under the cesium a consistency process we end the wind history industry need to know this before leasing takes place. The outer continental shelf lands act and the national environmental policy act or to broad legal frameworks that require significant analyses when development impacts to commercial fisheries among others. But because Boeing maintains that it is not reasonably foreseeable that wind of element will result from wind energy leasing the full environmental scoping process including economic analyses will not take place until after tens of millions of dollars. Poured into purchasing leases in engineering studies. This is backwards in my opinion. The fishing industry knows what these impacts are there will not be fishing in wind energy areas we can begin the scoping process now we're grateful that after years of that because he we are starting to see the foundations of economic studies taking shape. We need to look beyond single studies and focus on developing consortia to address specific questions fishing communities and when developers are starting to engage tackle these information challenges on the east coast. We could take a page from their book here. We also need to scope the indirect impacts the commercial fisheries appropriately there are many scientific questions that remain unanswered. That must be it answer by agencies developers before we'd sell these facilities we need to know whether floating when structures aggregate fish stocks result reducing access and fisheries productivity we need to know. What the loss of federal fish population survey stations will mean for our stock assessments and what management constraints we can expect from uncertainty being injected into the federal management process? We need to know about impacts to radar and other navigation tools we do there's no not only about what impacts these projects would have to sensitive. And yes a listed species what those impacts convene for commercial fisheries that those same species already constrained. We are heartened to hear that the state agencies working on this process are already working on many of these coping questions in our industry will be a good faith partner these efforts. We have a lot of pride of faith in California's CZ M. A. consistency process and we will not accept federal rollbacks of our because the commission's authority to enforce the coastal act thirty seconds we are obviously -- We all obviously have a lot of work to do to get this right. And I look forward to working with you senator and many of those here in the room as we move forward thank you. Thank you so much seven I'm very grateful we'll have some a follow up in just a bit were so appreciate any Hawkins is here she's the exact address for the response fostered about an alliance. Sagas the floor is yours you have five minutes and give you thirty second problem welcome. Thank you and thanks so much for inviting me to beautiful Eureka that's a nice -- Diversion for me from the usual D. C. life in the east coast so angrily rejected it the weather is like this every day hi. Yeah I've been here before. Yeah. Okay so -- My name is Anne Hawkins and I'm the executive director of the responsible off shore development alliance or Rhoda. Which is based in Washington DC road is a membership based coalition of fishing industry associations and fishing companies. With an interest in improving the compatibility of new offshore development with their business sense. We currently have members from Maine to North Carolina. On we provide a strength in numbers approach to coordinating science and policy initiatives to minimize conflicts between traditional and historic fishing. And other uses of the outer continental shelf which as we know are increasing rapidly. I mean today's has money I'm gonna focus primarily on offshore when leasing process -- Mike happy right more information on environmental impacts the glass panel cover that well. And then I did submit a letter for the record -- That we that showing some of our concerns with environmental impacts. One of the biggest obstacles rodas attempted to overcome is a lack of information incorrect information about offshore development plans. And the fact that they may or may not have on fisheries note ocean ecosystems. To be clear him anyways offshore wind energy development and sustainable commercial fishing are directly conflicting activities. Unfortunately on the east coast the rapid pace of offshore wind development and the failure to engage and transparent in early engagement with fishing communities. Has led to leasing in project design decisions being made without effectively minimizing impacts our stork sustainable commercial fisheries. Proper consideration of fishing practices and management takes a significant amount of time. Often fishermen regulators are being asked to provide information for purposes. And on special skills that I've never had manager relevance before so these data collection analytical intimate activities can take months or even years together right. The opportunities for public input leasing process alone do not occur often enough for early enough to allow for meaningful cooperation to reduce conflicts. Fishermen must never be seen as merely a stakeholder in the anything off showing developers are simply the newest stakeholders to our into California centuries old fishing industry which provides the state with your place will benefits jobs revenue food security tourism recreation. Actual males on dinner plates traditional ecological knowledge. And a significant contribution to the states for a dining. Sirota form last summer to better amplified the concerns of commercial fishermen and to better include their expansive knowledge and talk show in development process. And in some ways we found pretty receptive audiences -- To that and we recently signed a ten year memorandum of understanding with national marine fisheries service and the bureau of ocean energy management -- To communicate fisheries import better into the leasing process. And Oregon scientific products to better consider fisheries impacts -- So through that M. O. U. we've been able to work more closely alongside our government partners more often in the process -- To enable us to educate our fishing industry membership. Project development and to provide feedback to both names embalmer guarding the industry's concerns. We've also found it useful to work with wind energy developers directly -- We've invited currently holding developers to a joint industry task force that we formed on the east coast. To tackle some of the most difficult conflict areas between the two industries. Working directly together -- Will help identify best practices for up showing proper projects and provide a forum to drive innovative problem solving The state and California leaseholder shin braces club reproach as well -- We find that there's a lot of room for innovation when people actually talk about what's happening on the water they might not come out through the through the leasing process. A couple of houses Spokane to mitigation -- On the east coast aggressive state renewable energy procurement goals -- Drive after when markets which is a little different from here I understand -- And at that opens the door to variable purchase to medication and to destruction payments -- Among projects among areas. These discussions first and foremost need to be transparent and inclusive it is absolutely imperative that fisheries mitigation follows a step wise approach. First to avoid impacts they some possible second to minimize any accent absolutely can't be avoided. Then to mitigate any residual impacts appropriate spatial seasonal or technological controls and then and only then once those steps have been followed. Consider disruption payments for fisheries losses. Since the beginning of offer when development projects or spend the recognition of the need for regional science body to address research and monitoring needs for fisheries offshore wind interactions. Not just on a project specific level but to understand ecosystem impacts from the large scale installation of these new industrial projects. As well as the cumulative impacts of Malta police sites -- The relationship that wrote it has bill with government agencies now for wind energy developers. Has allowed us to assist in the formation of a new five oh one C. three at the response washer science alliance a rose up just affiliated -- Which is a collaborative effort among fishing industry representatives offer when developers and state and federal government agencies. We're working to increase alien incredible data on fisheries and when development and to increase the understanding the effects of wind energy development on fisheries and the ocean eco systems on which they depend. Thirty seconds California must similarly develop and support collaborative and initiatives to increase scientific understanding research monitoring. Which is paramount to achieving future co existence. We found a road on the hope to minimize the divide and conquer approach to interacting with commercial fishermen and rapidly developing ocean. Our successes of come from our ability to collaborate with fishermen and fishing related businesses will be affected by wind energy. Fishermen hold a broad range of beliefs and approaches to their interactions with other ocean users but they're also the single best source of information about the offshore environment. This information has to be brought to bear and constructive in time appropriate manner in order to ensure that one renewable resources and developed at the expense of another thank you. Thank you so much nice work really grateful would like me to open up for questions if it works for the three of you. Would like me to start with Dropbox tell us about -- You know we heard that that the association is in M. O. U. -- With printable power don't wanna say get into the exact details M. O. U. but what are you trying to be able to accomplish to be able to protect the fleet -- Well I've always like that saying -- If you don't have a seat at the table you're on the menu yeah but I think that when it comes to offshore wind energy with commercial fishermen -- We are trying to make is that we do have a seat at the table. But we are always going to be on the menu. Yeah in you talked about losing valuable ground right -- That would otherwise be utilized for commercial fishing. If you wanna talk about any of the other specific concerns to humble -- That we should be aware of that we should be looking at as we move forward. All. I mean. Like I stated and in my testimony -- There's so many closures already in California. We've just been bottlenecked into all of these other confined areas. And if we take away more grounds hundred square miles of area. I mean all we're doing is pushing us further and further in contention as work it's efforts shifted into smaller and smaller areas. So all over ground is very valuable it doesn't matter if we were to move it to the north or moved to the south. The bottom line is that we can't afford to lose anymore grounds. The challenges and one of the boards your mouth is the cumulative impact of what you've seen over the past many years with -- Closures with -- Areas that are now off limits except raise that would that be accurate yes okay thank you thank you very much would like me to go to miss Hawkins -- Can you give us a rundown of best practices that you've heard of it that you've seen in that you've implemented -- And then any lessons learned that would be good for all of us to hear about especially as we go forward with his burgeoning industry. Sure so in terms of best practices it's can this is surely give you a run down because we're still working on them I mean sure so a lot of ways to go all right -- The lane. For sure -- I mean. Like I said it's it's getting the industry's together is getting the fishing industry to the table early and often and not just to check a box not just you know we've we've. Heard here today you know we've had any meetings we've heard on these guys about a hundred fifty meetings on this project. But fishermen don't know where. Where their input is best given into the process they're not gonna bring that information effectively -- And a lot of it has to be driven by the fishing industry is should not ever feel like something that's being imposed on one industry by another. If the truth if the culturally as to to work together -- It's really you know. Co exist or are being more compatible -- So I would say you know is start everything early start your economics impacts studies early start your ecological surveys early you know now if you if you know what's coming now. Start working on it now -- And don't wait until you know you've got the short deadlines with a with the permitting process. You mentioned thank you -- You mention -- There were some conflict areas -- That had started to evolve. What can we learn here in the Golden State about what you're seeing is conflicts? Back east. What can I mean there's a lot of specific ones in sort of more general once I mean one one thing that comes to mind that that's really obvious one is that the first few -- Leases that were issued on the east coast were issued without any consideration of fishing vessel transit so even if you assume that there is gonna be closer to finishing. You know you have people that are going to fishing grounds on other on the other side how are they going to get through that array and and in New England we have a fourteen hundred square mile complex now. Lee says that just keep going on to each other. You know for fishermen on lobster boat across fourteen hundred square miles is no joke right -- But once the developer holds a lease and has developed the their their pricing and send the procurement contracts with the state -- It becomes very difficult for them to remove rows of turbines to allow for fishing vessel access that should have been written into the lease that should have been done up front. And now we're starting to one that that's the type of thing that you can look up a friend there's a lot of other examples like that but that's that's a pretty good. One that said thank you. For the valuable feedback on night. Thanks very good M. shopping hime -- It is about how you like to be a C. a formal process develop -- That would include the fleet -- Here in the months and years to come. That's a critically important question obviously. The I I think engagement with the the OPC. Social protection. Cancel end the coastal commission are the places to start I think we we need to start. Taking the initiative here in California -- Start having stir creating a forum for conversations with the the developers the wind industry -- Who also are seeking certainty in the space I I completely understand that -- That that's the model it's clearly the one that's demonstrating the greatest degree of success on the east coast -- And we are we're taking the baby steps now but without question our organization the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations the local associations closest and proximity. To the wind energy call areas and other associations of fishermen who do operate in these areas as well the to be at the table we've. Started on our industry side to have those conversations they'll continue -- And and we will continue to maintain the style. We heard feedback I am gonna have to wrap it up because we want to make sure that we provide time for folks to be able to provide comment as well we've heard feedback. About ongoing monitoring. In the importance of that -- In being able to have real time feedback if -- We have challenges. How important as it is that to the three view -- As well as far as the on going munching a communication to fleet in being able to build that into any agreements. I'll start with -- Here seem to work our way down in -- I just think it's crucially important that over this process for the next -- As it was stated maybe five years -- That. The fleet really has a say in and how this is done and we really hope that this is done right -- For magnitude research not just for fisheries but also for environmental impact as well I don't wanna say we'll have one shot reading this right but it really seems that we really do only have one shot at getting this right. And so I really hope that -- There's further dialogue in a lot more discussion with Ford with -- As we go through this process thank you so much your of course three with their sins comments -- Monitor is critically important. We need to set bass lines now those include economic bayside's human use bass lines -- But we can't. Do monitoring. In the sense of learning from mistakes and and pulling back from the break so to speak. If it's an all or nothing proposition with respect to development -- I'd love to see the state take a real interest in internet approaches -- Whether that be some sort of smaller scale operational implementation -- Putting ten turbines in the water instead of a hundred to start monitoring the situation there. And then determining whether or not these projects are appropriate or if there are any anticipate unanticipated. Impacts. I have a project if you will something like that right yeah. Absolutely thank you so much. Echo everything they said -- Your Monning is critically important but it's only wanderings only valuable if you have the correct building blocks on either side one is that it you know if you're monitoring and you see an impact -- You see an effect that maybe you didn't anticipate or maybe is worse than you thought what do you do about it so unless you have an action plan for what comes out of the monitoring. The Monning in of itself isn't very helpful and you also need to be able to effectively monitor you need baseline information. And that. In terms of fisheries takes a long time to get and you know one or two year time series of what's going on and in the spatial. Areas is not going to tell you what you need to know thirty years now to see what changes are you need to get. Started on those types of studies and designing those research needs as soon as soon as possible. Has there been -- In my ignorance and I apologize has there been compensation for loss of vision or anywhere else fishing gear -- No anywhere else in the world or on the east coast has there been discussion about data compensation for the fleet. There have been payments made -- In in Europe so in. In the U. K. fishing is allowed in wind energy or is in the rest of Europe it's not and so. The rest of Europe it was very easy to sort of nationally decide what to do with with. Fishing with fishermen who are displaced right because you know they're moving -- In the UK there were payments on the east coast there's payments in discussion and I wouldn't know if any checks Ben cut but but yes -- Unfortunately a lot of those discussions happened early in the process -- Before any impacts are minimized and that isn't going to keep people fishing that's a that's a good way to to pay off people that. That would like to retire anyway Doesn't doesn't do much for training fishermen in keeping so vicious animal M. will follow up on this as well but the sockets I don't mean that paper you twenty questions so thank you for your patience. So wide that describe the difference between Great Britain and then the rest C. Europe of allowing fishing around. Wind turbines and then -- Off limits elsewhere. It has something to do with the Magna Carta and public trust writes in the okay and if you can yeah. That's enough for today. It's it's some that will follow up on in -- On that have you heard of any conflicts so with when industry and at the fleet though -- I've been able to fish around I turbines has there been any challenges a lot of challenges a lot art will definitely follow up on that thank you so much we're gonna look to closing comments briefly please or start with miss Hawkins. Then Mr out -- Oppenheim Mister I bought please I just want to thank you again for for bringing me here and I'm happy to be a resource anytime that I can provide more information to the community or to the city or to anyone -- Working on this thanks thank you so much. Thank you very briefly -- Thank you for creating this forum for allowing the industry. To have a spot at the table -- And it without question we we need strong wise leadership in the future so be looking to you and to the committee for that. And I would just add that we we have an extraordinary opportunity here to learn from mistakes the the state agency. Staff who we've spoken with recently are up to the task and we look forward to supporting their work. Thank you so much trouble -- I just want to let it be known that if anyone would like to have any further discussion regarding any of this small is open and available otherwise thank you very much senator for allowing us to speak. Absolutely in a in a promise you will be following up with each and everyone of you -- We want take moment say thank you to our panelists give a round of applause please. In leasing Jim is Hawkins gets the word for traveling the furnace to so -- Thank you so much for coming -- Away from the east coast. Now we'd like to be able to open it up -- For public coming out we're gonna start out -- In again want to say thank you to the redwood coast energy authority we like to have their executive record to be able to come forward -- Who will lead us off in public comment -- Each individual who will be speaking at will have two minutes to be able to address the committee -- And on behalf of the committee we want to say thank you for hanging with us -- And hang with us. For the morning and now into the afternoon I were welcoming M. at the marshals the executive director of the red because energy authority have been real leaders here in the north coast on the issue of wind energy we welcome you Sir and want to say how much we appreciate. Your work the floor is yours -- Thank you know that I'll be brief M. for those that are familiar that right because Senate youth already is that local government joint powers agency here in humble county. And our mission is to develop sustainable energy initiatives on behalf of the county and all of our member cities. At and we are also responsible through committee J. segregation for the electricity supply part of electricity service here so we're we're responsible for procuring the power that that the power symbol county. And and so as part of that you know we're obviously interested in moving towards the state goals are local goals of a 100% renewable power. And I'm sure win is that is a huge potential there and so did to your point you know I think we're also as a local public agency very committed. To not wanting to have our power be at the expense of you know. Unacceptable impact environmental or fishing and you know concerns and so I think you know are proactive approach has been really to not be. Sort of passive and hope that this moves forward in a way that our community finds acceptable and that addresses environmental and fishing concerns and so. You know make my board is really I think been -- Bolden saying we want to get in front of this we don't want to just you know hope we get a lucky developer that really cares about these things as much as we do. And so that's why we've been very active in trying to to get in front of it and and move this forward with really a community driven process with environmental concerns in the fishing community and that the entire community. With a true seat at the table in the decision making and not being in a responsive reactive mode and so we're we're looking for to kind of continue that process and you know we have to work within the framework of the bomb process and and obviously of course that. The state environmental -- Regulatory process and that were we're eager to move that forward and we appreciate you having this event up here in humble county in non Sacramento and you know. We look forward to kind of continuing the local dialogue really having this conversation here in our community as this goes forward. Thank you no thank you so much in our C. A. allies really set the standards are do appreciate that Sir and please pass our thanks your board as well. We'd like to be able to bring forward I. individuals who now would like to Ben speak we're gonna queue up right over here to the microphone. If you don't mind is given as your first name and if you are with an organization organization thank you again for being with us you have two minutes please -- Dennis mail became legal before started like to tell the community that I we we need to have our thoughts and prayers for McKinley bill. Hello high school today we we had a a young person that seems Committed suicide cancel the trickle of closed and all of our our prayer should go out to the the the children there the family it's just a real bad deal so. Thank you for indulging me and I don't think you so much okay -- I'm Josh mail and wear many hats You said I was from a chemical committee serves a district which is correct and we are a member of this energy deals where that hat that I wear -- Also I worked on drilling rigs all over the country I worked on these platforms that floating don't float so -- I don't have a negative opinion about that and I also support of alternative. But also support that we need to use our natural gas which is fluent mental have lot of disagreement about that but that needs to be one of the other. Tools we have in our toolbox -- You know the the all of these things out really good in the hall to legislate your and on paper. But when they come down to those of us that actually produce. It's a different scenario -- It really it really -- Sure let me let me cut to the chase I I I. riven California commercial beach fisherman. Okay these guys for fish but they also are local crabbers there cooking line fishermen they're the guys to produce this great sustainable product that we need. We don't get the we don't get the support we need from our state and I know you reach out to us Mike we're having discussions right now about the crab closure the ridiculous clap crab closure. So everyone of these things that happen. Look out. It's going to be good -- These guys will protect us we don't trust none of that because it's not that not be in our history. The M. P. age that are out there have cut out a huge portion of our fishing. Unnecessarily this whole region is an MPA practically put the slayings on land. Or put him in the M. P. A.'s what you're just research areas anyway they're not they're they're not they're designed to produce fishing for us -- What other things it will communicate in writing with you -- I know this. Is gonna happen. Okay who who are not stupid we're just trying to figure out which I we want you to Galgiani. Thank you thank you so much to mail it your comments in thank you for being here and thank you for leading off -- On that recognition as well and the tragedy in making the bill's going. No it is it is thank you so much. Sir we welcome you thank you -- My name is Tyler studs I'm with ET P. renewables -- I lied -- The project manager for the red because doctor when project -- I bring to that -- About ten years experience in after when industry including eight with the state of Massachusetts -- Leading the state's investments in multi year multi million dollar baseline wildlife surveys The three points I want to make our number one to speak directly to the question posed in this panel -- I do believe that after wind wildlife and fisheries are compatible your work committed to making that actually be -- D. a yes -- I do believe that there are very good lessons learned but that each project is unique and those lessons learned are more in the process of how we create that then in the science findings themselves -- The third point is that we are I believe that we are on the right track So in terms of lessons learned in process sees -- I echo what's been shared by many of the panelists already and credit you for putting together phenomenal panel now -- Multiple panels. In the process it's key obviously to be engaged early and often with your all of the key stakeholders. Jointly scoping and identifying key research questions is critically important both on the fisheries level and on with -- With wide life -- Advocates in it and non profits -- We are as an industry engaging early right now with -- Key environmental -- Agent actually in vinyl not non profits to identify how we can together jointly scope those pricing join these couples questions and implement those. So I will lastly just advocate you know that this it's critically important the state make investments -- Improvement conducting you know early baseline wireless surveys be able to deal with existing data already to analyze those in the context of archer wind -- And that yeah. We do that you know in a very high priority way. So -- I really appreciate this opportunity provide comments and thank you very much again for not Ted thank you so much we're gonna have I. T. there are currently get your card is well. I before you leave thank you so much I know Tom as your contact contact information as well. Good morning actually good afternoon -- Do apologize for the weight thank you for hanging with this the floor's yours me if you just give us first name thank you -- I'm surely allows government affairs coordinator and tribal member of Trinidad rancheria thank you for and I'm sure that. Has been of a founding member of the the state balm a task force. And so the early engagement. It was conducted with tribes and I just want to say like everybody else I said today early and qualitative engagement is critical. And everything is connected and everything needs balance. And that true that rancheria we own and operate -- Trinidad harbor and so we work closely with the Fisher the local fishermen that fish out of Trinidad. And we also own a crab boat so we're directly impacted with -- Many aspects of the discussions that are happening today so we're following this process and were actively engaged and I just wanna -- Put in -- A plug -- For TKA the tribal -- Ecological knowledge and that that isn't a forgotten or not included when you're looking at the scientific Information aspect thank you says thank you so much really grateful that you're here providing that perspective and you left out the you make good chatter it C. skate. So -- It's a really good but at thank you very much and please pass center. Thanks to the board as well thank you so much it's good to see you and thanks for being here. Good afternoon and thank you for hanging with us the floor is yours. Thank you senator gore. Appreciate us having this meeting in the first place -- My name is Suzanne a tia I'm an investor for the California coastal national monument system. Based out of Trinidad -- With association -- In association with the only M.. The turnout museum in the Trinidad coastal land trust. In the spirit of saving what was left of our great read words we have to be careful not to give away what we can't get back. I'd like to speak for those who have no voice and a no on or not at this meeting right now. The other trust the mirror lets the puffins frigate birds turns. Pelicans and so many others some of which circumnavigate the globe with their ancient and historic flights. Wind farms are currently doesn't meeting birds and bats -- Mitigation and avoidance. Are not currently successful on land. Why should we think it will be off shore? A local sub species of bat will become extinct within the next ten years to land based wind energy. It is a current on it is a current ongoing problem which has not been solved. The birds may be out of sight do not but do not let them be out of mind. They depend on us to protect them. That's it thank you city thank you so much and thank you for being here today were grateful for your comments and your testimony. Taking notes on well good afternoon it's good to see you Sir welcome if two minutes. Thank you Mister chairman. For providing this opportunity today -- My name is Dave built some a local crap and salmon fisherman. Actually fish salmon -- As far south as fibers -- I want to thank -- Of want to talk about the the business of involving the fishing community early in the discussions. And I want to thank our C. eight E.. Eight for doing that to the extent that we've actually signed and M. O. U. with them. One thick principal power like was for reaching out to fishermen. There a couple of things that need to be included in not out reach -- The first is -- The issues of of transit of the harbor -- Of the footprint of the cable it's going to come ashore. What are the consequences of of that cable going to be? Order fishing grounds which it most of go through -- Are we going to be able to continue to come and go. From Humboldt Bay to fishing grounds at the time of our choosing rather than at someone else's pleasure that needs to be discussed soon. And the other thing is -- I heard today for the first time that there's an anticipated expansion if this works. Two of a production on the order of twenty gigabytes -- That could be great for the state of California could be good from all day. Where is the footprint for that expansion going to be? All presumably the of humble call area and the Morrell big call area or the best available sites. And we're looking at maybe two hundred megawatts from those sites we're looking at we we just heard about a proposed hundredfold expansion. Of offshore wind production. Our I would like to see. The energy industries maps as much as they want to see the fishing industries maps -- We have to do that before we get much farther with this expansion to twenty gigs. Thank you thanks much for C. Bates program for free here if you continue to work on behalf of the fleet thank you so much for coming today. All right. Good afternoon thanks for Janet Scott seeder your two minutes my name is Nancy Kirschner Rodriguez and I am here today representing the business network. For offshore wind. The network as we like to be called we're a nonprofit organization solely focused on the development of the U. S. offshore wind industry. And the advancement of its supply chain. We are -- Consider ourself and if Thor's Tatum voice for the offshore winds business community we bring together. Developers policy makers global experts and we have more than three hundred member businesses including numerous labor unions for critical discussions and unprecedented. Networking opportunities we just held our sixth international partnering forum and many of these speakers here today. Participated with us and a 100% of our resources are focused on the offshore wind -- Supply chain development we try to be an advocate for our members were dedicated to building business across sectors into a coherent supply chain. That supports domestic wind farms and really establishes the United States as a global competitor in the offshore wind market -- We were started in -- Twenty twelve in Maryland and we have grown -- To a significant number of as I said across the the state -- Obviously our work here our work here began in twenty sixteen and I want to thank -- Tom as well -- In twenty eighteen we held our floating frontiers. Meeting and produce an environmental -- Impacts paper from that and that is on your website we appreciate that we look forward to continuing to work with you one example that I would just site is that we have worked a lot with -- Jeff the British government and we have obtained -- Information about their debt Brent work with the broadly with the fishing industry and they are very interested in. Working further with you on discussion so I would look forward -- To helping us facilitate that as well and we just look forward to being a strong partner in. The numerous dialogues and also in the regulatory and legislative process thank you so much. Thank you for travelling humbled as well we're grateful you're here. All right we're gonna lock me ma'am. Good afternoon thank you for hanging with this is good to see you you have two minutes to four stores good afternoon thank you so much for putting together this excellent yeah -- Hearing and I want to say I've been to many -- Meetings on this topic and this is by far the most informative I've been. To mostly because of the diversity of voices an interest that have been represented here I think it's really important to have these types of meetings so that we can all hear the the concerns of different interest groups -- Humble bee keeper -- I forgot to say my name is Jennifer calls I'm the director of mobile bay keeper. Thinking and we're very hopeful that wind energy can help California meet our renewable energy targets -- In large part because we really need to slow down the effects of climate change which are -- You know having a a cumulative of a fact on not only marine resources but the fishing industry so ocean acidification toxic algae. Sea level rise are all serious problems here in Humboldt Bay -- I've been really relieved to hear so much discussion about the need for a baseline information to do appropriate citing for this -- Project -- And then also we really need to have an appropriate scale. And having stakeholder engagement that's a meaningful early on as been talked about many many times by many people that is really critical. And looking out the the wide range of companies that responded to the call -- I am really hopeful that our redwood coast energy authority will have priority -- Because they are a board of elected officials that represent the local interest and so we really need input from. Local experts as well as far you know experts from elsewhere -- We really need local stakeholders we need the tribal representatives -- We need everybody to be participating in the US and certainly we need a lot more information about the resources offshore -- Before we launch into this so it as an environmental advocate I just want to really emphasize the point that we're hopeful that the environmental impact analysis. Citing mitigation monitoring can all be done. As well as possible so that we can actually have a successful. Renewable energy project here thank you and Richard thank you so much thanks for coming today for all your work. Discounts when yes I got a work on councilman member it -- City for dell but I'm also have been very involved in the redwood region economic development commission. And I think this has some. Great potential for our area for economic development -- At the same time however -- I think we really need to go out and and look at best practices or people that have gone before us in other parts of the world. I'm sure there are other countries other companies that are -- Leaders in this area that are known for their best practices hopefully or and or have learned from their mistakes. So I'm hoping that will really do that research to be able to bring the best practices before we before we step in the wrong direction or do leases. We also need to make sure and I'm sure through the process it sounds like again we bought some great state colors together thank you. So much for doing that stern McGuire -- And everyone that has been involved here I think that's great -- I do hope that will mitigate for any a water fell fax -- Four I hope we will also -- Do cover the sustainable concerns of the fishing industry. And and their ability to navigate their ability -- To continue to create their own livelihood it's a great industry and I I hope that can continue. To other thought several quick ones -- One is -- That we well one other basically. If we do go forward I'm hoping that we take a look at this. I remember the old internet thing where you started out with a category three or then you went to five and then you went I'm hoping that if we are we do have the potential to do a project program like ten when mills or whatever. And then we're thinking of expanding this along the coast or whatever areas. That we build the capacity up front if we're gonna make a major investment in regards to getting this on shore -- I I hope we don't skinny on it but I hope we have the line capacity to really -- To really expand out. So that we don't have to make the investment twice -- Because we need to look at it forty fifty years out and and what we can really do with it if it is successful so thank thank you for being here. Thank you so much has been great for for your testimony today thank you very. And hang with us good afternoon you've been here since this morning thank you so much it's good to see the floor is yours your two minutes. Answer -- My name is Brad Wilson and you read as a graduate of the renewable or the environmental resources engineering program H. issue -- I see the potential of wind energy as a real asset -- I I'm an advocate -- This was a brilliant meeting today -- It's all grew up front stakeholder coordination across a wide spectrum that these sorts of things are going to be successful -- Those things be noted -- A wind farm off shore of any size -- Really as as locally reported as confirmed by Larry -- To Kerr -- Harbor district yeah commissioner -- Significant upgrades are required to report -- The four were really able to do anything off shore so hundred ten working surfaces new. Ports -- Potentially expanded infrastructure in transmission and distribution. All those things -- The policy table -- Brought it up as a potential issue -- The industry table -- Brought it up again -- That. Often times. The legislature or the local government is called upon to kind of overcome some of those initial baseline. Things to pave the way for industry to pave the way for a developer to come in. I was originally crafting this is a question to you but realizing you don't. Actually have the ability to respond I would suppose it's an encouragement. For the the California legislature to consider. The predecessor tasks that require significant funding -- You know hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the infrastructure to even attempt. An offshore wind farm given the wind farm is you know. Ten fifteen years out of all these process or tasks -- The ability to upgrade the port all of those things need to happen before and as a way to attract -- Industry to our area -- As example by cases in Europe -- So assuming you don't have the ability to respond California legislature is working on anything like that. I would encourage us to consider those things moving forward. No thank you miss Wilson and I'll just take a brief moment and I know that we have several speakers -- Keep it less than sixty seconds I think it's it's key that we look at what those potential up front costs will be for the infrastructure. In what it would take to be able To develop that. In our neck of the woods I think that you're gonna have to significant driving costs. One on the ground for the port. The second I when it comes a transmission line -- The state has assisted. Specific renewable energy on transmission in the past -- Through -- Greenhouse gas emission reduction funds. And that is not even begin been considered on this issue on this project let alone across the state for offshore wind but I promise you it's something that We will take a look at I would love to keep in touch and if it's okay. Thank you thank you so much as was appreciate that. Welcome Sir good afternoon. Thanks for hanging with us. Thank you Sir McGuire into the joint committee for sponsoring a terrific meeting I think it's just because of that it's been quite valuable thank you. My name is Scott Frazier my consulting wildlife biologist from the lake California. Early on in the on land when development hats be I was able to work on some of those projects where there was a high degree of trial and error learning. And that is certainly not what we want to see here off shore in a very difficult work environment. So I think that -- It's important that the baseline studies occur and the research be done before leases or sign so I'm here to strenuously agree with and support the comment no open I made about. Doing that work to know the impacts before the leases are signed. Is important and I think they can C. determination with the state agencies might be a good venue for that. I'd also like to echo Jan savages comment about the quality of information meetings and again today you made a really great start on that. I likewise have been to several meetings but it's basically the same information we heard the previous ones. The maximum future expansion offshore should be described. Due to both the fisheries access issues have been addressed in the environmental impacts that have been discussed earlier. So I think this idea about doing a ten tower project and then well if it works out we'll do some more. Is maybe not the way to adequately plan for a project that many people are here to endorse. So mapping the maximum potential now would be important. I'm here to speak for the migratory birds that don't get to vote and other wildlife generally. And I hope they should be given full consideration along with the human economic impacts including. Fishing and the other -- Livelihoods that people have the I. concerns of thank you for your time. Patricia refer your here today thinks ring with us along. Good afternoon ma'am it's good to see you thank you so much for being here. Hi I'm Stephanie did well executive director of friends of the river. And organization adamantly vehemently agrees that we need a bold action to draw down our reliance on climate destroying fossil fuels. That said we have some serious concerns about the potential impacts of this project. I think in its its worst case scenario -- These a floating offshore wind farms have the potential to cause pretty significant harm to both. Aquatic an avian life and I'm I'm encouraged to hear that the this is a long term plan that people are going into this looking at citing in mitigation very carefully. But I just I want to put this back in the context of of this region and the greater home okay region. And the fact that we are doing so much restoration work right now to save our some on it's species we're taking out dams were doing estuary restoration and yet. Our salmon are still struggling our our our fisheries in general are still struggling in our fishermen are struggling as we deal with things like the the early closure. On crabbing and so when we start looking at adding in what. Everyone in this room it minutes or potentially significant environmental impacts to a region that has historically been. A salmon stronghold in the struggling. I have to question where this fits in our long term thinking in terms of truly sustainable energy. And I I look forward to engaging in seeing how this goes but I do think that we need. To really think of in the local context. For how are we going to savor salmon and what is the significance of the impacts of the supposed to it. Thank you thank you thank you for your testimony today and again thank you for being here with us for so long as well. Thank you so much. Good afternoon and welcome. For yes Monning. Senator McGuire and now Mister west low for bringing everyone here together. My name is Mary Collins I'm a visiting scholar at the California institute for energy environment and I also direct the American jobs project -- And we recently wrote a report collaboration actually many people in the room collaborated on this report now which I'm very grateful -- For and we looked at this opportunity that we have to build a new industry from the ground up and and asking how we're gonna do this in a way that's gonna create. Win win solutions for the environments for fishermen -- You know and for labor -- Really to spark a new wave of innovation in our state. And as I sit here today I see that we have a lot of work to do And you know we need to have investment from the state of California so we can do the study so we can start to build these process sees -- And really create meaningful connections with -- You know the U. K. that's been brought up today there's a lot of great key studies there administer clear Perry just had her. Off shore hurt but the Osher when sector deal that came out that looks at the supply side and they want. To share information and knowledge with California in a meaningful way we've got a lot to learn we also have a lot to potentially offer. Their industry -- So I just want to conclude with the fact that you know this is an enormous opportunity to build this new industry from the ground up -- And I'd be happy to share case studies that we've been looking out over the years with successes from the offshore wind industry and hope that we can continue this conversation in a meaningful way. I would love M. is Connie thank you so much in in time you'll want to get together please let us know Andy under to sit down. Thank you so much for joining us today thank you good afternoon thank you so much for being here the floor source you have two minutes okay thank you our my name is Steven Coleman I am. That third division commissioner for the humble bay harbor recreation and conservation district. And also the community development and resilience director for the blue lake rancheria tried so. Juggling two hats here -- Like everyone is that a good thank you for this -- Holding this form and holding a hearing Eureka as you're well aware of any kind of development. You're on the north coast requires frequent and meaningful stakeholder consultation and engagement so appreciate that. Especially with the fishermen with the tribes with labor and everyone else here -- There's been a lot of dressed here I agree and believe that any development must be taken carefully with the needs of the current stakeholders in mind especially with the fishermen. Including -- In port development of which there is the opportunity to do a lot we have. Unused infrastructure here at that. Could use an influx of money in an influx of development and jobs but all that needs to be done compatible with the fishing industry. And not just not bringing harm but also bringing benefit and I think there's ways that can be done to do that. And I just wanna and with what. Hasn't been said and probably everyone considers doesn't doesn't need saying but I still think you know one of our biggest impacts out there is ocean acidification. And ocean warming and the only way we're going to have any chance of slowing that down even. Reversing that but just slowing down those horrific impacts to the fisheries to life on this planet is to a rapid shift. Towards renewable energy such as this and so. I would just encourage everyone what we're looking at the M. packs. To the environment to consider the positive impacts also for development such as this. And the positive impact that it could have to our fisheries and the positive impact that it can just have to the quality of our life in general. Thank you no thank you so much as common in your apps the right your spot on I in regards ocean acidification and how challenging it's been -- And it's getting worse -- Because of our reliance on fossil fuels so I'm grateful that you made that point today as well. Thank you so much. Good afternoon good afternoon senator requires could destroy us all can Bates humble fisherman's marketing association -- My job has been representing fishermen. Or with land use and zoning and planning person spot in. Nineteen eighty two on I am a couple things to say some of the things that no and person touched on when you talk about the regulations in the matter closed areas in California it's tremendous. The former ticket to to to take a felt pen. And start blacking in the areas off the California coast weather is restricted areas are closures most of the coast close to Scott some sort of encumbrance on it. So when when nor talks about basically compete in an eminent domain essentially these fishing areas this is something that fishermen are so extremely conservative and considered. The word about there's really no place to go. By the same token fishermen understand that these projects have to go forward so. The trick is to try to find a balance home office Sherman's marketing association has about a year's worth of dialogue with. A principal power in with our local energy provider through Matthew Marshall here. And we're so we're slowly moving along there's a lot to lots of work to do. On the second thing that I'd like to touch on is that a lot of people think that these impacts to the fishing fleet. Be it displacement in the ocean or displacement on should always far shore side facilities or something that's going to happen in the far distant future. And that is actually not correct It starts immediately with planning and essentially for for humble Bates it started on the particular date all of the humble bay harbor district put in a request. For a grant to go ahead and look at redesigning redwood terminal number one which is a facility that's 20% occupied by the fishing fleet. So these things have to be planned for way ahead of time. Again the trick is fishermen all these things are coming and to try to minimize the mounting impacts to this industry so that we can survive. Through this and the entire state to prosper thank you. It's Bates thank you so much and thank you for your on going after exam behalf the fleet. Yeah I would like to be a welcome the supervisor at to the hearing thank you so much better supervisor before about this thank you very much senator I'm just here to say. A huge thank you to you because being on the a redwood coast energy authority -- Representing the county of humble -- We have a C. C. E. O. commute -- Community choice -- G. -- Which dedicated itself -- To providing twenty five not twenty forty five three so we're talking about local clean energy but also just the concept of everybody talking together. Is extremely important and there were a couple of things mentioned I'm also on the advisory committee -- For born so I'm very well aware of the project the process they're going through as well but I would like to say that there were a few things were said that really struck me -- Jennifer said doing the right thing the right way. Because we're we're going in the right direction and all of the screener G. also protecting the environment protection the fisheries so we've got a wonderful wonderful task ahead of us. The challenge is great but it's very very exciting so I really hope we we continue with these. Nine anything you put together I'm right there Anderson -- Also I think the idea of offshore wind and and I'm a great fan of these guys that are doing this clean energy have been following them in Europe central. But the idea that they are the new stake holders I think was a a really good one mentioned by and because when a lot of times. Something is going forward it's got a lot of energy it's a big movement and you say we need to include the stake holders -- And it's kind of like Wilk who were at the stake holders well. There to stake holders in our environment and we need to include them but we also need to work very closely together so I just want to say a very big thank you to you. I put myself to working as hard as I can to make sure this works no I appreciate that ma'am supervisor and you have been in yeah I know your name continue to as well appreciate your advocacy. Thank you for being here for the entire time as well -- We're grateful for your testimony today we like to be able to announce our last call for public testimony. Last call for public testimony. Or anyone else would like to be able to address the committee this time. All right here in C. nine would like to be able to bring it back to committee and to be able to have a few closing comments. There's some thank you said we'd like to be able to advance and then -- Closing comments first of all want to say thank you to all of you who have been with us. Since this morning and we are so grateful for your testimony today we're grateful for your feedback and just know. This is just the beginning just the beginning of this process or we want to be able to formalize as we move forward with both the state agencies as well as the federal agencies. We want to say -- Send a hearty thank you to each of the panelists. Who have traveled from far and wide to be able to be here today I think Wiener giver panels another round of applause for these? There's some folks who helped put together this hearing -- And we wouldn't be here without them today again the individual to my right in in particular -- We owe a debt of gratitude to as always that's Mister Tom west Nile the chief consultant countries. That Tom. Want to say thank you to Carly revisions well stated Marcin and also Thomas with soul who is the district representative for humble Trinity as well don't tell our counties. For all their work we would not be able to do without them we want to say thank you to both Dana and Phil were behind the camera -- In if you heard any cussing that was probably Dana with the camera so I do want to say thank you so much we want to say thank you to Jeremiah and the Roy who are the Senate sergeants were here today for all their work. Find the ladies and gentlemen I want to leave with a few words. Number one is early number two is often we need to be communicating early about this issue we need to be communicating often about offshore wind energy. It we need to get together as a group get in front of this to be able to formalize the process. And I'd like to be able to end it as I started. We need to expedite the work of the task force that was created by both the federal and state governments to put meat on the bone. Meat on the bone when it comes to the rules and regulations to protect fishing grounds and our coastal environment where turbines would be located. As we know as we heard in many cases turbines would be placed at where there are high winds which also could coincide with up weld waters. In these waters have high levels of nutrients which mean there are high levels of foods or foods from sources which means our robust fisheries and marine life in the same locations or potential turbines would be located. There are several follow ups including learning from -- What is happened in the past so that we do not repeat those mistakes in the future -- And also learning what has worked in the past so we can replicate those issues in the future here on the north coast. This is not going to be the last time this is just the first that we're gonna be coming together and we promise you here in the next twelve months will be having a follow up hearing -- Is we start working with the regulatory agencies the fireman organizations. Out labor. This is Wells industry to be a start at putting details and firming up the vision of what this will look like here on the north coast. On behalf of the entire committee thank you for joining us -- In if you are in the wind you may also be Andy cannabis. I and we invite you to our one stop shop grand opening at four o'clock today -- Where we're going to be opening up -- The first of its kind at one stop service center that will have five different state agencies all under one roof serving the north coast I just three million dollar investment by the city California. The ribbon cutting is at four o'clock and we hope that you'll be able to join us so we make a licensing and permitting -- Easier here on the north coast Is well four o'clock -- There -- Right it was a time standard is time standard is on the top floor city California will now be on the bottom floor there in downtown Eureka without further ado. Thank you so much we are adjourned
