THE RENTAL MARKET BASED ON

VETERAN OR MILITARY STATUS.

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.878
CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS

00:41:54.845 --> 00:41:57.047
DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS TO

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:58.249

A BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.424
FROM THE MILITARY IT'S OFTEN NOT

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.959
ENOUGH TO COVER THE UP FRONT

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.061
COSTS OF RUNNING IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.832
ALLOWANCE.

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:16.000
DUE TO THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:17.268
WHICH I THINK WAS NOTED IN YOUR

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:18.535
ANALYSIS.

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.671

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.515
TO MESS UP THEIR HOUSING UNITS

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:20.250
AND ENSURES THAT THEY WILL PAY

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:23.987
IN FULL AND I I KNOW THERE'S

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:24.888
SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE BY

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:26.223
REALTORS AN APARTMENT

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.693
ASSOCIATION -- SO I JUST WANT ON

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.395
RECORD FOR PEOPLE TO REALIZE

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:33.163
THAT UCMJ IS.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.199
NOT TOLERANT ALL WHEN THESE

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.867
THINGS COME UP.

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.436
AND BEING A SERGEANT FOR TEN

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:39.970
YEARS I KNOW WE WERE NEVER

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:42.706
TOLERATE -- FOR PEOPLE LASSEN UP

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.608
ON THESE TYPES OF THINGS SO AS

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:46.310
NOT SIR WE'RE WE'RE NOT RUNNING

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:48.178
THESE OUT TO BE FRIED HOUSES FOR

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:51.849
YOUNG SOLDIERS -- SO.

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:53.617
A I JUST WANT THAT OUT THERE SO

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:54.818
MAYBE THAT WILL EASE SOME OF THE

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:59.790
CONCERNS -- BECAUSE IF THEY DO

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:02.426
MASS UP THAN IT DOES ATTACH

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:05.195
THEIR WAGES. FOR PAIN THESE

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.230
THINGS OFF CELL.

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:07.464
I THINK IT'S JUST WORTH BEING

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.532
SAID THAT WAY NOBODY HAS ANY

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.635
HICCUPS ON IT AND WITH THAT'LL

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:15.772
SECOND YOUR BILL. FOR ALL RIGHT

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.975
SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND I

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.978
APPRECIATE THE THE NOTION BEHIND

00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:23.180
THE BILL -- I WAS A REPRESENTS

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:23.981
SAN DIEGO.

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:24.948
PERSONAL PASSIONS ON HOUSING

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:26.150
ISSUES THIS IS A CONVERGENCE OF

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.851
THINGS I CARE A LOT ABOUT.

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:31.121
CAN THE SENATOR TALK ABOUT WHY.

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.123
YOU DIDN'T WHAT WHY.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.957
I KNOW WHY WE'RE TARGETING THIS

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.758
TICKET POPULATION AS MUCH OF THE

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.692
TESTIMONY ABOUT THE UNIQUE

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.394
NATURE IS A MILITARY SERVICE BUT

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:38.061
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.563
THE CONCERNS THAT YOU REPRESENT

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.331
IN THIS BILL ARE APPLICABLE TO

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:43.033
MOST TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.068
pCHOOSE TO GO DOWN A MORE

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.236
EXPANSIVE ROAD -- YEP TAKE THE

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.804
GIVEN THE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:50.941
THAT YOU THAT YOU'RE GETTING --

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.776
THROUGH THE CHAIR -- IT'S

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:54.144
BECAUSE THE RAT FIRST LINE

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:55.345
SENSITIVE TO ANY LANDLORDS AND

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.813
I'M SENSITIVE THE REALTORS

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.515
POSITION BUT BECAUSE THE UNIQUE

00:46:58.582 --> 00:46:59.850
REQUIREMENTS OF BEING AN ACTIVE

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:02.186
DUTY SOLDIER AND UNITED STATES.

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.520
I THINK THERE IS A REASONABLE

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:05.522
REMEDY FOR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:08.058
MIGHT ARISE THAT IS UNIQUE TO A

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:11.061
SERVICE MEMBER VERSUS OTHER --

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.162
MEMBERS OF THE POPULATION SELL

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:14.364
IT IS BECAUSE I'M I'M SENSITIVE

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:15.399
TO WHAT I DON'T WANT ANYONE

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:16.733
MESSING UP THE UNIT NOT BEING

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.268
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT.

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:18.869
AND I THINK IN THE CASE OF

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:21.271
SERVICE MEMBERS THERE IS REAL

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:22.339
ACCOUNTABILITY THERE THAT ISN'T.

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.373
APPLICABLE TO THE REST OF THE

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.975
POPULATION AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.510
DESERVING OF THAT.

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:28.912
PRODUCTION ONE MONTH'S RENT.

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:29.513
WHAT ANALYSIS IF ANY HAS BEEN

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.214
DONE?

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.648
THAT WOULD INDICATE WHETHER OR

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:32.482
NOT THIS WOULD PUT SERVICE

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.450
MEMBERS AT A COMPETITIVE

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.052
DISADVANTAGE FOR NINETEEN IN THE

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.186
PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.521
RIGHT AND THAT THAT'S THE ISSUE

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:40.123
OF DISCRIMINATION RIGHT AND SO --

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.460
AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY --

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.094
THAT THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:44.695
WOULD PROHIBIT THAT TYPE OF

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:46.597
DISCRIMINATION IT COULD GO ON

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:48.432
BECAUSE THAT A SERVICE MEMBER

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.967
SAYS I I AM AN ACTIVE SERVICE

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.335
MEMBER AND I DESERVE A REDUCTION

00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:53.203
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT WE ARE PASSING

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:54.004
LAWS.

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.405
AND WE HAVE A REQUIREMENTS IN

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.740
PLACE.

00:47:56.807 --> 00:47:58.041
TO HOLD THAT LANDLORD

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.576
ACCOUNTABLE IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.011
BUT NO ONE CAN.

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:03.347
SURE THAT -- IT WON'T OKAY WHEN

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.648
SOMEONE SAYS I'M A STUDENT EVEN

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:05.682
THOUGH WE PROHIBITS

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:06.316
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST STUDENTS

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:07.184
AND HOUSING.

00:48:07.251 --> 00:48:08.552
THEY COULD STILL MAKE A CHOICE

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:09.386
AND SO.

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.754
THAT THAT IS THAT THAT IS A

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:11.722
POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.290
CONSEQUENCES.

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:14.358
OF THIS LEGISLATION I WANT TO

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:15.726
ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND IF I DID FIND

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.227
IT TO BE A PROBLEM OUT THERE I'D

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:18.562
COME BACK AND ASK THAT THE BILL

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:20.464
BE REVERSED THAT REALLY WAS THE

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.665
CONSEQUENCE I CERTAINLY WE'RE

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:22.132
NOT.

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:23.867
AIMING TO TO DO THAT FOR THAT

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:24.701
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:25.669
LIKELIHOOD BUT IT IS A

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:31.708
POSSIBILITY OKAY IT IS -- I JUST

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:34.211
I I OBSERVE THAT -- YOUR CITY IS

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:34.811
REALLY HOT HOUSING MARKET THE

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:35.412
VACANCY RATES EXTREMELY LOW I

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:36.913
THINK SERVICE MEMBERS BY VIRTUE

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.883
OF THEIR PROFESSION AND THE THE

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:40.851
STRINGS THAT COME WITH THE

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.019
PROFESSION IS THE MISSION BY YOU

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:43.754
AND BY MY COLLEAGUE.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.957
MISTER MATHIS -- PLUS THE THE DH

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:48.358
IS REALLY RELIABLE SOURCE OF

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:50.027
INCOME -- IS PAID ON TIME THESE

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.995
ARE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.363
THEY GET I WOULD WELL AS RISE

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.164
READ THIS BILL LAST NIGHT I

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:54.931
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:56.800
GETTING AT I DO QUESTION WHETHER

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:57.601
OR NOT IT CREATES.

00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:00.003
PERHAPS THE OPPOSITE INTENDED

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.104
FACTS AND YOU JUST.

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:02.372
GAVE TESTIMONY SAYING THAT YOU

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:03.674
WOULD CHANGE IT IF IT CAME TO BE

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.808
THAT THE STAFF THAT THIS WERE TO

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:06.343
BECOME LAW WHO WERE FOUND TO BE

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.278
ACTUALLY HARMFUL THAN HELPFUL TO

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:09.980
VETERANS. FOR SERVICE MEMBERS.

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.348
I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- FIRST

00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:14.184
UP ON IN LINE -- TO TO CHANGE IT

00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:15.986
THIS THIS BUT BILL BY THE WAY

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:18.388

GUY CAN'T PARK IS IN MY DISTRICT.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:23.260
AND IT WAS THE MILITARY LEADERS

00:49:23.327 --> 00:49:24.461
WHO CAME TO ME AND AND RAISE

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:25.529
THIS ISSUE AS A PROBLEM THEY

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.030
WERE HAVING IN MY DISTRICT WITH

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:27.831
HOUSING.

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:30.367
AND TRANSFER OF OF OF SERVICE

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:31.702
MEMBERS TO THE AREA THAT'S WHAT

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.070
BROUGHT THIS BILL TO MY

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.438
ATTENTION WAS AND WAS IN A STAFF

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:36.306
DRIVEN IDEA IT ACTUALLY CAME

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:37.374
FROM MY FRIENDS IN THE MILITARY

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.909
YOU ASKED ME.

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:39.509
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.711
THEY'RE HAVING MY LAST

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.079
OBSERVATION JUST GIVE IN I CAN

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:43.947
RECOGNIZE THIS NOT THE LAST STOP

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:45.315
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR THIS

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:46.917
BILL -- IS CREATING MORE THE

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:48.352
RECORD IT'S IN THE BILL ANALYSIS

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:51.488
OF OF THE NEED FOR IT -- IS IS

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:53.657
MY UNDERSTANDING OF ON SOME OF

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:56.059
MY BASIS AT LEAST THE ON BASE --

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:58.161
HOUSING IS NOT FULLY UTILIZED --

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:59.896
AND THAT AGAIN IS ON A BENEFITS

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:01.031
AFFORDED TO EVERY TEN IT NO

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:02.099
SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE.

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.266
BUT WHEN CONSIDERING THE TO

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.302
TALLY FOR HOUSING CRISIS YOU

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.403
KNOW HELPING TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.372
PHENOMENON HAPPENS I RECOGNIZE

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:09.473
FOR FAMILIES IT'S OFTEN NOT AN

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.308
APPROPRIATE PLACE VERTICALLY FOR

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:11.775
SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN.

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:14.044
IT IS A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY --

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.479
BUT I WOULD IN FURTHERANCE OF

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:16.613
THE BILL IN ACHIEVING THE POLICY

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.148
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I

00:50:18.215 --> 00:50:19.516
THINK EXPLAINING WHY THAT

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:20.717
VACANCY.

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.352
RATE IS NOT THE S. NOT THE

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:23.587
ANSWER OPTICALLY WHEN YOU

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:24.688
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT TO

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.890
SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES -- SADLY

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.024
THE A SOME OF MY LOCAL CITIES

00:50:28.091 --> 00:50:28.892
I'M TO ALWAYS HAVE THE MOST

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.627
POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.362
MILITARY BECAUSE THE IMPACTS ON

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.296
MINUTES AS I WAS READING THIS

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:34.398

I DON'T WANT TO BE CONFUSED

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:38.402
OTHERWISE -- ANTICIPATING SOME

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:39.035
OF THE PUSH BACK AND TRIED TO

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.570
HELP CREATE THE LEGISLATIVE

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:41.872
RECORD ABOUT WHY THIS IS

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:50.747
NECESSARY AND WHY BETWEEN THE

00:50:50.814 --> 00:50:53.650
THE ALLOWANCE THAT IS PROVIDED

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:54.451
OVER ABOVE THE SALARY.

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:55.852
COUPLED WITH THE ON BASE HOUSING

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:56.686
THAT'S IT'S A PRETTY LUCRATIVE

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.921
BENEFITS ASSUMING THAT IT'S IN

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:58.889
GOOD CONDITION -- AND

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:01.124
GEOGRAPHICALLY APPROPRIATE --

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:02.459
THAT DID THIS BILL STILL

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:03.860
UNNECESSARY AND YOU KNOW THIS IS

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:04.661
SOMEONE WHO THINKS THE HOUSING

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.228
CRISIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE
