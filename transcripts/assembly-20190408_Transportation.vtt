85
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.550

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:45.120
THE INCOME CAP SHOULD BE

87
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.740

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.380

WE'VE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF

269
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.770

FROM THESE COMMUNITIES TO HELP

271
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.400
PEOPLE MAKE A CHOICE TO WALK NOT

272
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.330
NECESSARILY DR -- IT'S ELECTRIC

273
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.000
VEHICLE THAT SUSTAINABLE AND

274
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.310
AND WE FRANKLY FIND IT AN

275
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.970
UNFORTUNATE CHOICE WHEN CARRYING

276
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.430
A COUPLE GALLONS OF MILK OR

277
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:14.780
A COUPLE OF BAGS OF GROCERIES

278
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.090
YOU GO FOR YOUR CAR KEYS AND

279
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.970
USE A TWO TON VEHICLE TO DO

280
00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.150
THAT WE THINK IT'S MUCH MORE

281
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.470
PRACTICAL TO DO THAT AS A

282
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.570
PEDESTRIAN WERE OF VERY HUMAN

283
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.790
CENTRIC COMPANY WERE NOT AN

284
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.380
AUTONOMOUS COMPANY WE HAVE

285
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.830
NO INTEREST IN AN AUTONOMY

286
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.080
WERE ACTUALLY PROGRAMMING

287
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.350
AND TRAINING OUR VEHICLES TO

288
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.040
UNDERSTAND THE WAY PEOPLE MOVE

289
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.470
AND TO MOVE THE WAY THEY MOVE

290
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.170
-- AND AS A HUMAN CENTRIC

291
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.500
COMPANY WE ARE VERY SAFE --

292
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.600
THE VEHICLE WEIGHS MUCH LESS

293
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.090
THAN A BICYCLE WITH THE PERSON

294
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.660
ON IT IT'S MUCH SMARTER THAN

295
00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.970
A BICYCLE GOES MUCH SLOWER

296
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.400
-- WE THINK IT'S GONNA BE ONE

297
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.400
OF THE SAFEST THINGS ON THE

298
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.190
SIDEWALK -- AT IT

299
00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.140
IS -- HAVING A A SENSOR

300
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.420
ARRAY THAT FOLLOWS PEOPLE

301
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.270
IT UNDERSTANDS WHAT A PERSON

302
00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.690
IS AND HOW THEY MOVE AND --

303
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:09.670
STOPS IN CASE THERE'S ANY --

304
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.240

OUR LIST AND WHERE WE WANT TO

308
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.130
BE BECAUSE OF THE CLIMATE BUT

309
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.810

COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR BIGELOW

359
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.250
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN --

360
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.670
COUPLE QUESTIONS HERE --

361
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.710
FIRST ONE IS HAVE YOU DONE

362
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:57.870
THE CALCULATIONS ON WHAT THE

363
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:59.240
IMPACT WILL BE TO THE ELECTRIC

364
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.670
GRID -- AS AS THIS ISN'T

365
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.500
REALLY A TRUE ZERO EMISSION

366
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.590
IT DOES CREATE EMISSIONS TO

367
00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.780
GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND AND

368
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.240
SO THERE WILL BE A DROP ON

369
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.920
THAT FACTOR AND THEN THERE

370
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.370
WILL BE A DRAW UPON THE THE

371
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.890
USE OF ELECTRICITY SO HAVE WE

372
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.030
DONE THE STUDIES TO SEE WHAT

373
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.330
THE IMPACTS WOULD BE CREATED

374
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.480
AS MORE THESE BECOME UTILIZED

375
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.500
YEAH MICHELIN OKAY -- ADDRESSING

376
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.740
THAT QUESTION BUT

377
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:29.100
SO THE THE STUDIES THAT WE'VE

378
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.580
DONE HAVE BEEN MOSTLY COMPARING

379
00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.960
THIS TO ANY VEHICLE LIKE A CAR

380
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.540
TRIP OR OF A MOTORCYCLE OR

381
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.880
SCOOTER TRIP OR EVEN AN ELECTRIC

382
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.570
BICYCLE TRIP IN OUR ELECTRICITY

383
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.760
USAGE IS FAR LOWER THAN

384
00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.560
ANY OF THOSE VEHICLES --

385
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.310
WE COULD GIVE YOU -- A SUM

386
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:49.690
TOTAL DRAW ON THE GREAT IT'S

387
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.220
IT'S VERY MINOR I MEAN THE

388
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.780
THE BATTERY PACK WE USE IS THE

389
00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.030
EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT FOR A LAPTOP

390
00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.220
COMPUTER BATTERIES AND WE HAVE

391
00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.920
A RUN TIME OF AROUND FOUR AND

392
00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.570
A HALF TO SIX HOURS DEPENDING

393
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.900
HOW QUICKLY YOU WALK SO IT'S

394
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.640
NOT A SUBSTANTIAL EXTRICITY'S

395
00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.490
SURGE AND THE SECOND QUESTION

396
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.780
IS AS A PER UP IN PERSON IS

397
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.250
WALKING ACROSS REAL PEDESTRIAN

398
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.640
LIGHT I NOTICE THAT THERE'S AN

399
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.680
EXTENSION BETWEEN THE THE USER

400
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.100
AND THE WALKER AND OFTENTIMES

401
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.870
WE SEE PEOPLE CROSSING WHEN

402
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.830
THERE'S JUST A COUPLE OF

403
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.950
SECONDS LEFT THIS WILL BE A

404
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.680
LAG TIME AND IT WOULD PROBABLY

405
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.690
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE

406
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.790
ABLE TO BE SEEN READILY -- BY

407
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.540
A MOTORIST WHO SOME YOU KNOW

408
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.860
GET READY TO TAKE OFF HAVE WE

409
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.940
ENCOUNTERED OR THOUGHT ABOUT HOW

410
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.690
TO ADDRESS THAT BY TIGHTENING

411
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.160
UP THE GREATEST I CAN ANSWER

412
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.810
-- THE THE G. TO ACTUALLY

413
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.890
HAS A DYNAMIC FOLLOWING DISTANCE

414
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.540
SO IT IS YOU GO SLOWER IT

415
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.210
GETS CLOSER TO YOU IN AS YOU

416
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.690
SPEED UP IT MOVES A LITTLE BIT

417
00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:54.020
FURTHER AWAY NEVER MORE THAN

418
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.110
SIX FEET AWAY FROM A PERSON AT

419
00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.800
ITS TOP SPEED WHICH FOR US IS

420
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.110
SIX AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR

421
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.180
SO THE EIGHT MILE AN HOUR IS

422
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.380
GREAT AND IT IT IS COVERED IN

423
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.050
LIGHTS AND THE LIGHTS ARE THERE

424
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.030
MORE FOR THE BYSTANDERS SO THAT

425
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.320
THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S MOVING

426
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.610
AND THE WHITES ACTUALLY MOVE

427
00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:09.830
IN THE PATTERN OF MOVEMENT SO

428
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.280
YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY IT'S MOVING

429
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.020
-- SO WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

430
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.320
SAFER THAN BEING FOLLOWED BY A

431
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.690
PERSON -- WE ALSO FEEL TO

432
00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:18.330
SAFER DEVICE THAN A BICYCLE OR

433
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.630
A DOG -- BECAUSE IT IT WEIGHS

434
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.710
LESS THAN IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH

435
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.570
SMARTER THAN TEN PERCENT ON

436
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:24.800

768
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.050
WE WOULD BE THE VESSEL OWNER

00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:36.640
TWO OR JUST ONLY THAT TWELVE TO

770
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.700
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD GOT THE TERM

771
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.190
CONFUSE LIKE WHAT WHAT TRY TO

FIGURE OUT WHAT IT DOESN'T IT

773
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.130
DOESN'T COVER JUST EVER VOTE

774
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.640
RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE LAW READS

775
00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.730
IF A BOAT IS A DRAFT WHICH MEANS

776
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:46.950
-- THE PERHAPS A SAILBOAT WHERE

777
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.620
THE -- THE PERSON WHO WOULD

778
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:49.730
BE THE OPERATOR OR MAYBE THE

779
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:51.020
ONLY PERSON ON BOARD GOES TO

780
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.130
WORK THE RATING -- OR CHANGE

781
00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.310
SOME OTHER STATUS ON THE BOAT

782
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.790
THAT PERSON TO TECH TECHNICALLY

783
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:56.710
NOT THE OPERATOR BECAUSE THEY

784
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:57.740
DIDN'T HAVE THEIR HANDS ON

785
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.590
THE CONTROLS ABOUT BUT THEY'RE

786
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:00.530
THE ONLY PERSON THERE WHO'S

787
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.070
COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

788
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.400
THE SAFE CONDUCT OF THE VOTE

789
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.010
SOME REALLY WITH THE TWELVE TO

790
00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.900
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD -- SOMEBODY HAS

791
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:08.440
TO BE RESPONSIBLE THERE SOBRE

792
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.080
AND ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL OF

793
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.430
THE VOTE IN CASE OF EMERGENCY

794
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:12.990
SO THIS BOAT DOES THIS VOTE

795
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.420
SPEAK TO SOBRIETY IN ANY IT'S

796
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.870
COVERED UNDER THE TENETS OF

797
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:17.970
THE BILL IS NOT NECESSARILY

798
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:19.230
DOESN'T IDENTIFY THE GOAL IS

799
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:20.630
TO DEFINE THE PERSON WHO'S

800
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.910
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MINOR AS

801
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.390
AN OPERATOR AND AS AN OPERATOR

802
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.740
THAT RESPONSIBILITY WAS OVER

803
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.020
SO IF I HAVE A BOAT AND I TURN

804
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.370
IT OVER TO ANOTHER PERSON TO TO

805
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.260
TO -- TO PILOT IN THIS PERSON

806
00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.570
KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE A VOTE THIS

807
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.400
PERSON'S VOEPEL EXPERIENCE AND

808
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.700
THEY DO SOMETHING NEFARIOUS

809
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.400
WHEN MY BACK'S TURNED AND GET

810
00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.440
INTO HARM'S WAY OR SOMETHING

811
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.870
THAT'S ILLEGAL WHAT I THE

812
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:42.390
OPERATORS TO BE HELD LIABLE

813
00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:45.790
I GUESS THE KEY PIECE OF

814
00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:46.990
INFORMATION SIR WOULD BE WHO

815
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.830
IS WHO IS A PERSON CURRENTLY

816
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.330
OPERATING ABOUT IS THAT PERSON

817
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:52.850
AUTHORIZED OPERABLE IF THEY'RE

818
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:53.870
TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS OLD

819
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:54.790
THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T BE THE

820
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:55.860
OPERATOR BECAUSE THEY CAN ONLY

821
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.430
OPERATE UNDER SUPERVISION THE

822
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.460
ONE THEY'RE NOT I MEAN THIS IS

823
00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.720
THE ONLY SPEAK TO THAT TWELVE TO

824
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:01.950
FIFTEEN ONE NOW -- IN THE

825
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.710
CONTEXT AYE AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT

826
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:05.010
YOU'RE SAYING YES SIR WE'RE NOT

827
00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:06.040
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CREATE A

828
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.270
GREAT A LIABILITY TO THE OWNER

829
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:08.370
OF THE BOAT VERSUS SOMEBODY WHO

830
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.780
LEGALLY OPERATING ABOUT A PERSON

831
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:10.950
LEGALLY OPERATING ABOUT HAS A

832
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:12.560
VOTER CARD AND THAT PERSON IS

833
00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.580
IN PHYSICAL CONTROL THEN THE

834
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.190
INVESTIGATION WOULD LEAN TO THAT

835
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.430
PERSON BEING THE OPERATIVE ABOUT

836
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.720
SO TOOK DOES THE BILL SPEAK TO

837
00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.050
THE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD

838
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.610
THAT'S WHERE HAVE USES COVER

839
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.240

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.220
THE TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEAR OLD

841
00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.850
THE WHICH I BELIEVE AS THE LAW

842
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:32.070
WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN PEOPLE

CONTROL AS WELL WILL BE LABOR

848
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.470

1136
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.920
-- AND -- DEFINITELY A TRAFFIC

1137
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.860

1138
01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:34.300

I JUST THINK THERE ARE SOME

1167
01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:19.280
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES OF PARTS

1168
01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.560

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.340

1173
01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:28.970

1174
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.660

1179
01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:40.830

1183
01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:48.800
THERE'S A THIRD ONE I THINK

1184
01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.590
THAT WAS CITED -- WHY THEY'RE

1185
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:52.230
INADEQUATE TO COVER THIS

1186
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.540
PARTICULAR TYPE OF CONDUCT

1187
01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.600

WELL WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND

THEY USE THEIR VEHICLES TO

1258
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.680

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:10.830
A REGULATION WHICH WOULD

1713
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:12.270
MANDATE ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE

1714
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.480

THE A ARBY'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE

1718
01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.650
THE REGULATION WOULD RESULT

1719
01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:22.030
IN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

1720
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:23.550

1722
01:21:26.150 --> 01:21:27.290

FUTURE I'M SUPPORT OF IT HI

2247
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:09.860
MY VIEW IS THAT FROM A GOOD

2248
01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:11.170
GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT IN ITS TWO

2249
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:13.540
IS THE TAX DOLLARS -- WE CAN BE

01:37:14.010 --> 01:37:15.980
YOU KNOW HAVING USING TAX ARE

2251
01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:17.820
TO PUT IN CHARGING STATIONS AND

2252
01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.920
THEN USING TAX DOLLARS TO TAKE

2253
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.950
HIM OUT THANK YOU ARE SOMEONE

2254
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:22.130
OVER FONG AND I AGREE WITH

2255
01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:23.320
YOU A THOUSAND PERCENT THAT'S

2256
01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.940
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY

2257
01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:26.870
I INTRODUCED THE BILL -- AND

2258
01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:29.470
-- WITH THE WAY THE CURRENT

2259
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:30.930
CAR REGULATIONS ARE GOING IT

2260
01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:32.640
WOULD BE REQUIRED -- TO RIP

2261
01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.110
OUT ANY CHARGING STATIONS THAT

2262
01:37:34.110 --> 01:37:35.420
DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE CREDIT

2263
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:38.440
CARD -- A CREDIT CARD OPTION

2264
01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.270
IN THE THE COST OF THAT WAS

2265
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:41.800
QUESTIONED BY THE OPPOSITION

2266
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.890
BUT IT'S CARBS OWN NUMBERS THAT

2267
01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:45.220
STATE IT WOULD BE SIX THOUSAND

2268
01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.460
DOLLARS PER CHARGER FOR A TOTAL

2269
01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.530
OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION

2270
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.920
DOLLARS IN WASTED TAXPAYER MONEY

2271
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.240
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RIPPED

2272
01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.290
OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T CURRENTLY

2273
01:37:53.290 --> 01:37:54.890
HAVE A CREDIT CARD AND THE

2274
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:55.950
REASON THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE

2275
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:58.300
CREDIT CARDS EVEN THOUGH -- SB

2276
01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:01.550
-- -- WHAT IS IT FOR FIFTY

2277
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:03.200
FOUR WAS MISREPRESENTED BY

2278
01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.090
THE OPPOSITION SB FOUR FIFTY

2279
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:06.730
FOUR CLEARLY STATES THAT YOU

2280
01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:08.530
CAN HAVE A CREDIT CARD OR YOU

2281
01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:09.550
CAN HAVE A DIFFERENT PAYMENT

2282
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.470
METHOD IT'S NOT AN AND IT'S IN

2283
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:12.970
A WAR I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE

2284
01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.550
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A HAND IN A

2285
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:16.530
WAR AND BECAUSE AS BEFORE FIFTY

2286
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:17.920
FOUR HAD THAT THAT MEANS THAT

2287
01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.670
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHARGING

2288
01:38:18.670 --> 01:38:19.920
STATIONS OUT THERE THAT DO NOT

2289
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.850
CURRENTLY HAVE A CREDIT CARD

2290
01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:24.310
PAYMENT METHOD -- AND SO THAT'S

2291
01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:26.220
THAT'S -- YOU KNOW WHY MY BILL

2292
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.970
IS FRANKLY MORE ACCESSIBLE

2293
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:30.530

2294
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:32.200
FIFTY FOUR WAS BUT ALL SIX MORE

2295
01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.970

IF THEY PROVIDE CREDIT CARD

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.370
OPTIONS ARE NOT -- HOPEFULLY

2303

THAT SMARTPHONE OWNERSHIP IS

2342
01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:46.880

2358
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:11.900
THE ISSUE OF THE COST THAT WAS

2359
01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.800
RAISED EARLIER -- ALL TO SAY

2360
01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.870
THAT WE ALL WANT TO REACH OUR

2361
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:16.360
STATE'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE GOALS

2362
01:40:16.630 --> 01:40:17.920

OUT OF OPERATION TO BE REPLACED

2364
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:21.790
IN ADDING COSTS IS NOT HOW WE

2365
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:23.500
GET THERE AB FOURTEEN TWENTY

2366
01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:24.890

2367
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:26.770

ALL THIS FOR YOUR BILL TODAY

2373
01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.630
YOU KNOW THE -- WITH THE WRONG

2374
01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:41.880
AMOUNT OF CHARGING STATIONS

2375
01:40:43.110 --> 01:40:45.180
NOT ENOUGH YEAH HANDED LIKE

2376
01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:46.350
TO TAKE THAT OTHER HUNDRED

2377
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:48.130
AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND

2378
01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:50.900
ACTUALLY CAPTURE INFRASTRUCTURE

2379
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:52.590
WHEN WE HAVE THESE HUGE

2380
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:54.510
MANDATES MOVING FORWARD AND

2381
01:40:54.510 --> 01:40:56.060
I'VE HAD CONSTITUENTS ACTUALLY

2382
01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.580
COMPLAIN TO ME THAT THEY'VE

2383
01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.270
NOT BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE BECAUSE

2384
01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:01.100
THERE'S TOO FEW AND FAR BETWEEN

2385
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:04.530
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT ADVANCING

2386
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.820
A TECHNOLOGY I DON'T WANNA

2387
01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.520
PUT PARAMETERS IN IN PLACE AND

2388
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.660
ACTUALLY PREVENT US FROM MOVING

2389
01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.290
FORWARD I WOULD THINK THAT WE

2390
01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:15.180
WANT TO PUT THE CART BEHIND

2391
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:17.190
THE HORSE AND ACTUALLY GET

2392
01:41:17.220 --> 01:41:19.190
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE BEFORE

2393
01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:20.920
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE CARS THAT

2394
01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.350
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF BUT ONLY

2395
01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.380
IF THEY CAN BE UTILIZED IN A

2396
01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:27.940
PRACTICAL FASHION WITH THAT

2397
01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:29.060
I KNOW THIS POLICY IS NOT

2398
01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:31.000
PERFECT I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH

2399
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.660
THE OPPOSITION TO FIND SOMETHING

2400
01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:34.890
THAT WILL COME TO A COMPROMISE

2401
01:41:34.890 --> 01:41:37.130
OUR BALANCE BUT

2402
01:41:37.130 --> 01:41:39.410
RIGHT NOW EVERY TIME THAT THESE

2403
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:41.940
AGENCIES PUT ANOTHER SEE OR

2404
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:44.400
COST ON THE CONSUMER MAKES IT

2405
01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.340
FURTHER AND FURTHER UNATTAINABLE

2406
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.590
THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL

2407
01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:51.330

2449
01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.160

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.880
CONTINUE TO RACE AND ANECDOTALLY

2454
01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.100

PAYING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

2463
01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:48.300
FINE IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR THEM

2464
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:49.770
BUT HAVING THEIR CAR IMPOUNDED

2465
01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:51.210

2466
01:43:51.210 --> 01:43:53.390
DETERRENT IN ADDITION THIS

2467
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:54.330

2468
01:43:54.330 --> 01:43:55.410
THAT THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT

2469
01:43:55.410 --> 01:43:57.390
