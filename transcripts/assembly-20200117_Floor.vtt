KING JUNIOR. EVERY YEAR AS WE

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.402

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:26.937

UNFORTUNATELY ABBREVIATED LIFE

00:38:29.006 --> 00:38:30.775
A WORD THAT ALWAYS COMES TO

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.711
MIND IS SERVICE. SERVICE I'M

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.513
SURE IS NOT A FOREIGN WORD TO

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:38.349
ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM. WE ALL

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.351
MADE THE DECISION TO RUN FOR

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:40.985
OFFICE IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.654

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:46.090
ISN'T JUST A WORD. I BELIEVE WE

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.758
STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.161
LEARN WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:50.594
FROM THE WAY DR KING

00:38:50.661 --> 00:38:53.664
EXEMPLIFIED SERVICE. FOR HIM

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.500
SERVICE WAS A NECESSITY. NOT

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.835
BASED ON EGO OR OR ON RECEIVING

00:38:57.902 --> 00:39:00.805
ACCOLADES. IT WAS A LIFE OR

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:04.141
DEATH EVERY DAY DECISION. THIS

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:05.943
WAS EVIDENT BY HIS COURAGE TO

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.978
SAY THE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:08.446
BE SAID. NO MATTER HOW

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:12.183
UNPOPULAR. HIS WILLINGNESS TO

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:12.883
BE IN THE PLACES THAT SAW THE

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.452
GREATEST INJUSTICE NO MATTER

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:17.288
HOW DANGEROUS. AND HIS

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:18.556
COMPASSION WITH THE PEOPLE WHO

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:20.658
FACE THE GREATEST INEQUITIES.

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:21.258
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LOOK LIKE

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:24.662
HIM. AS WE STEP INTO A NEW

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:27.631
LEGISLATIVE SESSION. I IMPLORE

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.033

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.502

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.641
PAGE FROM DOCTOR KING'S BOOK.

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.044

HOPE WE ARE ABLE TO SAY THE

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:47.518
TRUTH EVEN WHEN DIFFICULT AND

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:48.853

SIGNIFICANCE TO US. YOU KNOW

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.248

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:15.052
THINK- TO LIVE LONG ENOUGH. TO

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.887
REMEMBER DCTOR KING. AT

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:19.890
ACTUALLY REMEMBER SEEING THE

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.191
MARCHES ON TELEVISION LIVE

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:23.126
SAYING THERE YOU ARE MARCH ON

00:49:23.193 --> 00:49:24.995
WASHINGTON SEEING THE SELMA

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:26.430
INCIDENTS SAYING THOUGH IT

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:27.531
WATER HOLES TURNED ON

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:28.832
INDIVIDUALS AND THE DOGS TURNED

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:30.834
ON THEM. I'VE ALSO HAD THE GOOD

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:34.438
FORTUNE OF. GOING TO THE SOUTH

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:35.639
OF DURING THE ERA IN THE

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:37.874
NINETEEN FIFTIES AND SIXTIES.

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:38.508
AND BE AND SEEING THE KIND OF

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.610
DISCRIMINATION THAT EXISTED.

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:43.347
AND THE FEAR AND THE DIFFICULTY

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:43.947
OF PEOPLE TRYING TO LIVE JUST

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:46.516
ORDINARY LIVES EVERY DAY. AND

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.352
THEN I HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

00:49:48.418 --> 00:49:50.487
EXPERIENCE OF ACTUALLY BEING

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:51.788
HERE WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:54.825
ASSASSINATED I WAS AT UCLA. AND

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:56.360
WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.695
TELEVISION. AND HAVING THE

00:49:58.762 --> 00:50:01.331
FEELING OF LOSS AND ABANDONMENT

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.734
THAT OCCURRED FROM MY STUDENTS.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.668
WE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.770
SOMEONE FILLED WITH PEACE WOULD

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:07.371
BE TAKEN OUT IN SUCH A VIOLENT

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:09.840
MANNER. AND WE HAD THE

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:11.708
OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL A SENSE OF

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.910
LOSS IN THE MIDST OF. AN ERA

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:14.544
THAT WE THOUGHT WAS FILLED WITH

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:17.981
HOPE. SO IT'S INTERESTING AS WE

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.183
TALK ABOUT THIS AND DR KING'S

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.986
LEGACY COMES FORTH. WE HAD

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.287
YESTERDAY MR MCCARTY SELLERS

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.889
WHOSE FATHER WAS WHAT WHAT PART

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:27.758
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.760
TALK IN PERSONAL TERMS BECAUSE

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:31.428
SOMETIMES WE CAN GET CAUGHT UP

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.462
IN THE SPEECHES AND THE

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.731
STATEMENT THAT PEOPLE MAKE. AND

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:36.500
WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE PERSONAL

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:38.135
COMMITMENT. AND THE PERSONAL

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:40.837
LOSS THAT SO MANY INDIVIDUALS

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.305
SUFFERED IN THIS COUNTRY BLACK

00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:44.474
WHITE JEWISH INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.942
BASICALLY WERE KILLED WHEN THE

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:48.011
CIVIL RIGHTS ERA STANDING UP

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.547
FOR JUST SIMPLE THINGS. LIKE TO

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:51.448
WRITE TO BE ABLE TO VOTE OR TO

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:53.350
MARY WHO YOU WANT WHAT TO DO

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.118
THE THINGS THAT WE TAKE SO MUCH

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.753
FOR GRANTED. AND SO I'VE BEEN

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.054
FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS

00:50:58.121 --> 00:50:59.956
EXPERIENCE OF AS A PART OF MY

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:02.159
LIFE THAT IS A DRIVING FORCE.

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:04.928
ABOUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY IN

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.329
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.030
ACHIEVE THE KIND OF JUSTICES

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.632
THAT BEARD. I ALSO HAVE THE

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.167
UNFORTUNATE FEELING AT THIS

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:13.069
POINT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.438
IN THIS IN THIS IN THE TWENTY

00:51:14.504 --> 00:51:15.872
TWENTY. THAT I'M WOULD BEING

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:18.508
PULLED BACK INTO AN ERA. THAT

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.776
WE DON'T WANT TO EVER GO BACK

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.812
TO AGAIN. THE HATRED. THE

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.780
DISCRIMINATION THE BURNING THE

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.081
SHOOTINGS THE THINGS THAT ARE

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.950
BASED ON RACE AND GENDER AND

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:28.785
RELIGION THAT IS SO UNFORTUNATE

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:31.021
THAT MARRED THIS COUNTRY. THAT

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:32.856
MARRED THIS COUNTRY AND MADE A

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:33.824
MAN HAVE TO GIVE HIS IN HIS

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.293
LIFE FOR US. TO BASICALLY

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.794
REMEMBER THAT THIS SHOULD NEVER

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:40.464
HAPPEN AGAIN. AND SO I FEEL A

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.132
SIN SO IT'S INTERESTING AS I

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:44.134
STAND HERE ON THIS FLOOR-

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.635
HAVING BEEN A PERSON WHO WILL

00:51:45.702 --> 00:51:48.738
BE OBSERVED IT. AND FELT IT AND

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:50.106
THEN STUDIED IT AS A STUDENT AT

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:51.975
UCLA IN MY DOCTORAL WORK TO

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:54.110
LOOK AT THE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:55.512
THAT OCCURRED IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:58.215
AND TO KNOW HOW MUCH SACRIFICE

00:51:58.281 --> 00:51:59.049
THAT PEOPLE PUT INTO MAKING

00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.718
SMALL PROGRESS. AND I SAY THAT

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.120
BECAUSE AS WE SIT HERE AND

00:52:04.187 --> 00:52:05.322
WE'VE ALL BENEFITTED FROM

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:07.257
DOCTOR KING'S PRESENCE WHETHER

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.825
IT'S BEING ELECTED TO OFFICE

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.594
AND HAVING COMMUNITIES TO

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.195
EMBRACE US- THAT NORMALLY WOULD

00:52:12.262 --> 00:52:15.031
NOT HAVE EMBRACED US. WE HAVE A

00:52:15.098 --> 00:52:17.834
TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:23.073
RESPONSIBILITY. TO FIGHT. EIGHT

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.140
TO NOT LOSE SIGHT. TO BECOME

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:24.941
INDIGNANT A- DISCRIMINATION AND

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.443
RACISM AND SEXISM WE HAVE WE

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:27.711
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHARE

00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:29.045
THIS ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT IS

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.580
WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT WHEN WE

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.382
TALK ABOUT CELEBRATING

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.683
INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT IT MEANS

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.986
TO CELEBRATE. IF THERE HAD BEEN

00:52:36.052 --> 00:52:37.254
NO MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY. IF

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.855
THERE HAD BEEN NO A NATIONAL

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.891
CELEBRATION. WE PROBABLY WOULD

00:52:40.957 --> 00:52:42.959
FORGET ABOUT KING. WE PROBABLY

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.961
WOULD LOSE OUR SENSIBILITIES TO

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.229
THE KIDS OF ISSUES THAT HE

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:49.332
RAISED. BUT FORTUNATELY HAVING

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:50.133
A NATIONAL HOLIDAY A STATE

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.402
HOLIDAY IN A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.

00:52:52.469 --> 00:52:54.104
BRINGS US BACK TOGETHER EVERY

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.373
YEAR. TO REMIND US HOW

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:59.109
FORTUNATE WE ARE. BUT MOST

00:52:59.175 --> 00:52:59.976
IMPORTANTLY TO REMIND US OF THE

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:01.978
DEBT THAT WE HAVE TO PAY. THAT

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.713
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT US BUT

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.181
IT'S ABOUT THIS NATION IN THE

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:06.983
FUTURE THAT'S THE YEAR. AND AS

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.518
THIS NATION TEETERS ON ALL OF

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:10.287
THESE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WE

00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:11.788
WILL SEE THIS WEEKEND. THE

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.123
MARCH IS A IN IN VIRGINIA WITH

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:14.558
NOW THERE MAY BE VERY VOLATILE

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.426
BECAUSE- FOLKS OF FIGHTING EACH

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.296
OTHER. OVER THE PRINCIPLES THAT

00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:19.896
WE THINK ARE EMBEDDED IN THIS

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.531
NATION. WE HAVE A

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:23.767
RESPONSIBILITY AS A LEGISLATOR

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.135

CITIZENS. WE HAVE A

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.171

BEINGS WHO WANT A BETTER WORLD

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:32.709
FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN.

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:34.511
I WAS READING THE OTHER DAY THE

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:36.246
THOSE THE SPEECH THAT KING GAVE

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:36.813
WHEN HE RECEIVED THE NOBEL

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.549
PEACE PRIZE. ANY TALK ABOUT ALL

00:53:39.616 --> 00:53:40.951
THE THINGS HE REFUSED TO

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:43.453
ACCEPT. HE SAID HE HE REFUSED

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.588
TO ACCEPT THAT WE ARE

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:46.957
POWERLESS. HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.325
THAT THE NORMAL VIOLENCE AND

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.860
MILITARISM IS A WAY OF LIFE. HE

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.596
REFUSED TO ACCEPT THOSE THINGS

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:53.563
BUT HE ALSO SAID HE HAD AN

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.333
ABIDING FAITH. IN THE ABILITY

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.435
OF MAN TO RESURRECT HIMSELF IF

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.203
FROM THE MIDST OF ALL OF THIS.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.205
AND TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.007
THAT EVEN IF WE LOSE ONE OF THE

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:06.643
BATTLES TO THE EVIL FORCES. IN

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:09.779
THE END WE WILL RISE AND WIN.

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:11.481
AND SO I CALL UPON YOU TODAY TO
