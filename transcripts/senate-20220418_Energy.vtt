THE OPPOSITION IN TERMS OF.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:13:01.447
THERE ARE A- THIRD SUGGESTION

00:13:01.514 --> 00:13:02.348
THAT THIS COULD DISPLACE WORKERS

END OF THE DAY THIS BILL- THAT

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.991
WE SEE IS BASICALLY IT LIVE

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.559
LIMITS ELIGIBILITY TO PROGRAMS

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.294
THAT THAT ARE LIGHT DUTY

00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:17.296
VEHICLES SO IT SIMPLY DOESN'T

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:19.198
IMPACT TRUCKING AND SHIPPING

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:21.267
WHICH IS WHERE THE JOBS ARE NOW

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.401
THAT THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THE

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.137
FOLKS ABOUT REPRESENTS I TOTALLY

00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:26.572
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A KIND OF

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.573
BROADER IDEOLOGICAL SENATE

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.910
CERN'S ABOUT. AUTONOMOUS

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.379
VEHICLES. AND I THINK THAT'S

00:13:33.445 --> 00:13:35.114
SOMETHING WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.081
TO BE WATCHING CAREFULLY AS THIS

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:37.983
WHOLE DEBATE CONTINUES. BUT THIS

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.286
PARTICULAR BILL IS JUST LIMITED

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.421
TO LIGHT DUTY. AND SAID THAT THE

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.223
TYPE OF JOB DISPLACEMENT THAT

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.492
HE'S TALKING ABOUT I THINK

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:47.593

SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT THAT AGE

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:06.612
YOU DON'T HAVE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.013

HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:30.402
THE THINGS THAT WE WORK ON

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.338
EARLY- PROBABLY ABOUT TEN YEARS

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:35.541

WORKERS WASN'T REALLY. A GOOD

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:46.352
THING FOR CALIFORNIA WAS

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:48.387
ACTUALLY BACK THEN. THE LABOR

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:50.389
FEDERATION WAS PUSHING THAT AND

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:53.259
THEIR ARGUMENT WAS. THAT TYPE OF

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.060
POLICY ACTUALLY HELP TO CREATE

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:56.929

00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:34.953

STATEWIDE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AND

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:14.377
AS WE ALL KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.379
TRY TRY LOOKING AT ALL ARE

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.114
HOMELESS PROGRAMS BUT WHEN WE

START BIG PROGRAMS LIKE THE CITY

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.284
A COUPLE OF YEARS TO COME ON AND

I CAN SAVE MY EXPERIENCE WITH

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:24.754
THE SUMMER PROGRAM. AUTHOR IN

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.022
TWENTY FIFTEEN WE COME ONLINE

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.556
UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN AND

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:27.757
STARTED GETTING ALL THE

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:29.325
APPLICATIONS AND IT IS THE

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.094
PROGRAM BY ALL REPORTS IS DOING

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.763
VERY WELL AND THE PURPOSE OF

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.664
THAT PROGRAM WAS FOR THE

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.666
BENEFITS TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:39.435
LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHICH

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:40.970
IS WHAT. WHAT THE PROGRAM IS

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.605
DESIGNED TO DO ON THE ROOFTOPS

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.706
NOW THIS TAKES A DIFFERENT

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:44.474
APPROACH TO ANNA AND I

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.876
UNDERSTAND THAT AND I WOULD BE

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.277
WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.612
THE AUTHOR. IT SHOULD THIS BILL

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.014
MOVE FORWARD TODAY- BUT I THINK

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.952
THE REDUNDANCY- IN AND I THINK

01:00:56.019 --> 01:00:57.553
AS- IT. ARE I THINK IT IS

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.589
POINTED OUT HERE THE SAVINGS TO

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:00.990
THE ACTUAL. LOW INCOME

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.658
CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR POCKET FOR

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.961
THEIR UTILITIES WILL NOT BE AS

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.729
REDUCE WITH THIS AS THIS IS

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.131
UTILITY DRIVEN AND- IN FRONT OF

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.766
THE METER VERSES. ON THE

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.367
ROOFTOPS WHICH WERE STILL TRYING

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.436
TO MEET THAT GOAL OF HOW MANY WE

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.571
CAN GET UP ON THE ROOF TOPS SO.

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.073
FOR THOSE REASONS AND I WILL.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.307
BUT LIKE TO CONDEMN AGAIN IF

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.609
THIS MOVES FORWARD TO CONTINUE

01:01:19.675 --> 01:01:21.778
TO WORK BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.346
ROOM FOR ALL TO OCCUR BUT I

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.714
THINK RIGHT NOW- TO START. AND

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:26.149
SOMETHING NEW THAT'S UTILITY

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:28.317
DRIVEN AND NOT GOING DIRECTLY.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.519
TO LOW INCOME HOUSING AND WE

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:31.921
KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE AND

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.589
COMPLICATED IS TO MAKE. WELL

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.792
HOUSING PROJECTS PENCIL OUT. AT

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.427

IN THE HOUSE- IT'S COMPLICATED

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:46.169
SO. FOR THAT REASON I WILL NOT

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.670
BE ABLE SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:49.072
IF IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD LOOK

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:51.140
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK.

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.576
ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. IT IS

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:59.215
THERE ANYONE ELSE- CENTER REVIEW

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:01.150

CENTER PRESS ANY RIGHT NOW AND-

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:29.412
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:31.080
WORRY ABOUT IS YOU KNOW WHEN

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:31.948

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:33.583

PROGRAM. IS NARROWLY DEFINED AND

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.760
TARGETED DEED RESTRICTED UNITS

01:04:24.827 --> 01:04:26.929
WHICH ARE A FRACTION OF ALL. OF

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.431
LOW INCOME UNITS IN THE STATE OF

01:04:28.497 --> 01:04:31.067
CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S NOT BAD.

01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:33.636
BUT IT'S A THREE HUNDRED

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.472
MEGAWATT PROGRAM. THAT BY LAW.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:40.810
BY THE ACTION OF. OF A GOOD BILL

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:42.278
THAT CAME FORWARD BEFORE. EARLY

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.747
TAYLOR'S- THAT APPROACH A TO

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:48.217
DEED RESTRICTED UNITS- THERE IS-

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.453
A HUGE PIE UNFORTUNATELY OUT

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.989
THERE OF NON DEED RESTRICTED

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.658
UNITS WHICH ARE LOW INCOME-

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:59.095
WHICH- NEED. NEED SOLAR THE

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.130
ROOFTOP SOLAR WHICH IS BILL DOES

01:05:01.197 --> 01:05:03.899
ALLOW FOR BY THE WAY OR- NOT

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:07.203
ROOFTOP SOLAR- IN. IN IN EACH

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.605
CASE- IT'S A DIFFERENT BUSINESS

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.507
MODEL IN THAT. THE INVESTOR

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.876
OWNED UTILITIES HAVE TO PAY IN

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:16.412
BUILT IN THE OF THE THEY HAVE

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.781
THE SKILL TO DO THAT- THE OF THE

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:21.684
LIBERTY TO DO THAT- BUT RETURN

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:26.155
FIFTY PERCENT. OF ALL EARLY. OFF

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.624
THE GRID RIGHT BACK TO THOSE LOW

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.759
INCOME TENANTS UNIT BY UNIT BY

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:34.664
UNIT- SO. SIMILAR OUTCOME PEOPLE

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.699
ARE LOOKING FOR HERE IS TO MAKE

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:37.566
SURE THAT EITHER IN EITHER

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.669
PROGRAM THAT LOW INCOME TENANTS.

FINALLY GET THE ADVANTAGES OF

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.106
SOLAR- BUT A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:45.574
APPROACH IN TERMS OF BUSINESS

01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.676
MODEL AND ONE THEY'RE BOTH

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:48.678
THEY'RE BOTH OFTEN PROGRAMS TO

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:49.945
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNER DOESN'T

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.114
AGREE TO HAVE EITHER OF THESE

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:52.848
PROGRAMS IF IT'S NOT GONNA

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:55.384
HAPPEN- SO I THINK THAT'S THE

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.419
BEST EXPLANATION I CAN. HAS

01:05:56.485 --> 01:06:00.022

THIS THIS IS A BILL WHERE I

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:28.951
THINK SOME OF THINGS WE HEARD

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.853
EVEN FROM OPPOSITION TESTIMONY

AT THAT TO CONTINUE TO GROW THAT

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:42.465

01:22:06.955 --> 01:22:08.657
SO THAT'S MY CONCERN I GET YOUR

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.625
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH.

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.594
DETAILS AND SORT OF. CUTS

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.829
THROUGH A TRICKY POLITICAL. YOU

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:17.032
KNOW LINE HERE BUT I'LL JUST

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.566
RAISE THAT AS IS MY CURRENT

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:26.508
CONCERN. OKAY VERY WELL ANYONE

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:29.010
ELSE TO HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:31.279
MOTION- SERMON DID YOU WANNA

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:34.416
MAKE COMMENTS. YES SO I'VE HEARD

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:35.650
A LOT OF CONFLICTING THINGS ON

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.252
THE VIABILITY OF CARBON CAPTURE

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.688
AS I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.790
RIGHT APPROACH- AS AS A SORT OF.

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.258
THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT MATTER BUT-

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.659
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:45.794
THE OPPOSITION IS STATE

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.995
CONSTRUCTION BUILDING TRADES

01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:48.596
COUNCIL AND I WAS WONDER IF YOU

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:50.899
COULD ADDRESS THEIR OPPOSITION

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.033
AND IT WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:57.505
WITH THEM. THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:58.473
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.742
WOULD BE IF WE LET EVERYTHING

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.610
USE CARBONCAPTURE THE- AT LEAST

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.813
THE IPC REPORT IDENTIFIES

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.114
SEVENTY SIX. WE'RE TRYING TO

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:11.052
NARROW THAT INTO WERE THE

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:13.488
RESERVOIR FOR THE WELL THAT THAT

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:14.856
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE IF THEY

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.392
IN FACT IS GOING TO BE COLOCATED

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:19.361
THERE THAT'S WHAT WE ONLY HAVE

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.363
THREE IN THE PLANT NOW NOW SOME

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.465
OF IT IF IT WORK. IN OF NANCY

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:25.400
SKINNER HAS A BILL THAT ONLY

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:28.236
FOCUSES ON ON CEMENT BUT CEMENT

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.505
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WANTED

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.006
TO DO THAT SO THERE'S A QUESTION

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:34.242
OF WHERE THAT CEMENT PLANT WOULD

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:37.112
BE TO A RESERVOIR PROBABLY NOT.

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:40.382
COLOCATED SO THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:44.219
THE LIMIT- YOU KNOW WE- THE

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:45.987
POTENTIAL IS GREAT I MEAN

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.089
THERE'S A LOT OF CARBON CAPTURE

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:49.657
GOING AROUND. THE COUNTRY THE

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.493
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUT. BUDGET

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.395
DEL INTO A TWO SO THE IDEA IS

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.196
THAT WE WOULD. THROUGH THE

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:57.499
BUDGET. PROCEDURE PUTS SOME

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:58.833
MONEY IN THERE SO AT LEAST

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.069
THESE. WORK COMPETITIVE TO FIND

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.804
OUT WHAT THE BENEFIT IS THAT

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:05.373
MIGHT MIGHT. ROSS THIS WAS THAT

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.375
WE COULD TAKE. ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:08.610
BEST PLACES NOT BETTER

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:10.845
COMPROMISED BY EARTHQUAKES NOT A

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:13.314
COMPROMISE THERE'S IT'S- A VERY

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:14.716
MODEST STEP CONSIDERING THAT

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.584
THERE IS SO MANY. LOCATIONS THAT

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:18.887
ARE POSSIBLE. AND SO YOU'RE A

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.422

RATES TOO. HARD IN OUR GRID

01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:18.538
WHERE WE HAVE CREATED PROGRAMS

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:20.707
TO FIGHT FIRES. THAT THIS SHOULD

01:46:20.774 --> 01:46:22.809
EVEN APPLY TO SAN DIEGO ANOTHER

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.444

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:39.793
SAYING HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.329

HAPPEN. AND SO THAT ADDS OF.

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:46.466
FUEL TO THE PER PER VIEW RUBIO

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:50.170
FIRE HERE. IN THAT- IT GIVES

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.472
RISE TO LEGISLATION LIKE THIS

01:46:52.539 --> 01:46:55.475
THAT. THIS SIMPLY ASKING FOR

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.410
ACCOUNTABILITY SO THIS IS A

01:46:57.477 --> 01:47:02.182
REALLY HARD ONE TO- TO BALANCE-

01:47:02.249 --> 01:47:04.217

AFFECTED LIKE THIS- WE WILL

01:47:13.527 --> 01:47:15.195
THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF

SAN DIEGO RECENTLY AND HAVING

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:17.597

FIGHT FIRES TO CLIMATE CHANGE

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.109

AS A LEGISLATURE NOT TO PUT PUSH

01:47:37.984 --> 01:47:40.086

THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE UP. ON ON

01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:46.026
THE FIGHT TO SOLVE SOME OF THE

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.111
WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:08.281
MEASURES TO THINK TO MAKE THESE

EXPRESSED A SOME OF MY CONCERNS

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:59.459
AND BUT I JUST WANT TO START BY

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:00.827
KNOWLEDGE GENE YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:02.462
THE WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:03.930
THE PAST YEARS AND YOU KNOW I

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.865
WAS PART OF MANY OF THE

01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:06.733
DISCUSSIONS THAT. ARE YEP

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.768
NEGOTIATIONS WITH AB TEN FIFTY

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:10.603
FOUR I BELIEVE IT WAS AND YOU

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:12.439
KNOW WE HEARD THE STORIES OF

01:50:12.505 --> 01:50:14.874
LIVES LOST WE HEARD THE STORIES

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:16.977
OF HOMES DESTROYED AND LET'S

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.411
FACE A SIMILAR TRAUMA THAT THESE

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:20.347
FAMILIES HAVE IT ENTERED I MEAN

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.315
SOMEONE NEVER GET OVER IT SO WE

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:24.317
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:25.819
IS A REAL CRISIS HERE AND WE-

01:50:25.885 --> 01:50:28.355
ARE TRYING TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE.

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:30.156
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DO HAVE

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.125
SOME REAL CONCERNS ABOUT COST

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:33.860
AND THIS IS A VERY AMBITIOUS

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:35.495
PLAN WHICH IS YOU KNOW

01:50:35.562 --> 01:50:36.629
ABSOLUTELY NEEDED AS WE'VE

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:37.897
ALREADY STATED SOMETHING THAT WE

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.666
NEED TO START MOVING FORWARD

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.835
TOWARDS BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:50:41.901 --> 01:50:44.304
THE COST BEING PUSHED DOWN TO

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:45.872
RATE PAYERS AND- AND I DO

01:50:45.939 --> 01:50:47.707
APPRECIATE THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:50:47.774 --> 01:50:49.409
EXTENT PRECISION I HAD OVER THE

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:52.078
WEEKEND WITH AUTHOR IN FACT I

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:52.746
APPRECIATE THE- AMENDMENTS THAT

01:50:52.812 --> 01:50:54.848
WERE SHARED WITH. MORNING ARE

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:57.984
BUT I STILL I BELIEVE THAT- EVEN

01:50:58.051 --> 01:50:59.719
THOUGH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.788
STATES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.490
EXHAUST ALL FEDERAL. AND STATE

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:05.258
FUNDING BEFORE THEY CAN RECOVER

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:07.260
FROM RATE PAYERS I THINK THEY'RE

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:08.995
STILL GOING TO BE A COST ON THE

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:10.430
LASSEN AND WE ARE STRUGGLING IN

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:12.665
TERMS OF- I THINK ONE OF THE

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:14.234
SPEAKERS STATED THE INFLECTION

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.502
INFLICT THE INFORMATION THAT

TALKING ABOUT UNDERGROUNDING HAS

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:47.026
BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR MANY OF

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:48.695
THESE PLACES FOR ALMOST A

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:50.864
HUNDRED YEARS. AND IT WAS

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:56.002

CALIFORNIA EDISON THERE WAS ONLY

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:09.382
ONE MAJOR FIRE IN OUR SERVICE

01:53:09.449 --> 01:53:12.352
TERRITORY IN IT WASN'T CALLS BY

IN ONE BREATH WE WANT TO BLAME

01:53:16.723 --> 01:53:18.591
IT ON CLIMATE CHANGE BUT AT THE

01:53:18.658 --> 01:53:20.593
SAME TIME WE NEED TO BLAME IT ON

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.929

WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO GET LINE

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:35.642
CLEARING DONE. THAT'S THE

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.410
BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW A

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:39.612
COBINATION OF FILLING THE CUT

01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:42.415
DOWN TREES. AND OUR CLIMATE

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.651

THESE POLES AND WIRES HAVE BEEN

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:48.254
IN SOME OF THE SAME RIGHT AWAYS

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:50.023

01:53:56.396 --> 01:53:58.398
OCCURRENCE AS EVEN AUTHORS

THOUSAND SET OUT SIXTEEN.

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:05.004

CHANGE AND WE HAVE SEEN A LOCK A

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:11.578
MANAGING OF OUR FORCE AND THERE

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:12.512
WILL BE A REAL COSTS TO

01:54:12.579 --> 01:54:14.347
RATEPAYERS. THE UNDERGROUND LINE

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:15.882
IS USUALLY ABOUT A MILLION

01:54:15.949 --> 01:54:19.886
DOLLARS PLUS A MILE. AND THAT'S

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.054
BOUNCE ON THE REPAIRS BELIEVE

CALIFORNIA EDISON AND DELAY IN

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:34.867
JUST BY DOING THAT ALONE IT

01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:36.936
WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. THIS

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:39.072
WILL TAKE. YEARS TO GET THE

01:54:39.138 --> 01:54:42.742
AVERAGE UPRIGHTS ARE PROJECT

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:45.178
PLANNED AND DONE AND THEN YOU

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:49.649
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TELCO

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:52.485

01:54:58.291 --> 01:54:59.759
UNDERGROUNDING SPECIALLY HIGH

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:01.828
TRANSMISSION LINES LEADS TO

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.564
LONGER OUTAGES SO WHAT WE WILL

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:06.299
CREATE AS A CUSTOMER BASE WHO

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:08.668
NOW WILL BE COMPLAINING WHY HAS

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:11.471
MY POWER NOW BEEN OFF FOR DAYS

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.106
IF NOT WEEKS AT A TIME BECAUSE

WHEN IT'S OVERHEAD YOU CAN

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:17.744
EASILY SPOT. A BAD TRENDS-

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:20.380
TRANSFORMERS BAD- CONDUCTOR ARE

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:22.782
BAD RESISTIR A BAD WIRE WHEN

01:55:22.849 --> 01:55:25.251
IT'S UNDERGROUND YOU HAVE TO DIG

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:27.253
IN SEARCH FOR THAT BAD OUTAGE

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.322

WE'RE MOVING OUT IN THE WERE IN

01:55:38.698 --> 01:55:40.767
THE WRONG DIRECTION IF WE THINK

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:41.434
UNDERGROUNDING IS GOING TO SOLVE

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:43.169
THIS PROBLEM WHAT WILL SOLVE IT.

01:55:43.236 --> 01:55:44.537
FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR IS

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:46.272
DOING BETTER MANAGING OF OUR

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:48.374
FORCE. APPLYING BLIND CLEARING

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.443
TO REMOVE THE FUEL THAT EXISTS

01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:52.645
THERE TODAY SO I CAN'T SUPPORT

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:55.815

COLLEAGUES FROM LA HE'S

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.466
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NEW CLIMATE

01:56:13.533 --> 01:56:17.904
CHANGE FACTOR IN TRANSMISSION

01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:21.074
RISK- BUT BECAUSE OF THAT THAT

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:24.344
RISK- WITH HIGHER WINDS WITH

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:26.479
HOTTER DAYS. WITH MORE WILDFIRE

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:29.482

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:35.254
TO BE MOVING IT FORWARD- AND

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:37.323
I'VE WHAT I SENSE FROM THE

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:37.924

01:56:45.665 --> 01:56:47.567
FIRESTONE SPECIFICALLY TO

01:56:47.633 --> 01:56:50.603

RATEPAYER COSTS BUT BUT

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.707
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO DEAL

01:56:54.774 --> 01:56:57.810
SPECIFICALLY. WITH WILDFIRE RISK

01:56:57.877 --> 01:56:59.212
AND THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:00.780
GETTING THEIR POWER SHUT OFF.

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.315
YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:03.349
WE'VE SEEN THESE WILDFIRE

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:05.284
MITIGATION PLANS COME OUT. AND

01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:06.619
HIT THE POWER STILL GETS SHUT

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:08.588
DOWN EVERY TIME THE WIND KICKS

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:09.655
IN THE OVER SEVENTY MILES AN

01:57:09.722 --> 01:57:11.424

SERVICES PEOPLE ON NEBULIZERS

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.402
LITERALLY LOSING THEIR POWER

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:24.303
LOSING THEIR LIFELINE- I THINK

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:26.105

APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HERE

02:00:49.542 --> 02:00:52.845
TODAY. A FEW ITEMS AND JUST BEEN

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.013
TAKING NOTES AND I'M GRATEFUL.

02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:55.314
RIGHT NOW P. GENIES BEEN IN

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:57.083
ABOUT ONE POINT THREE TO ONE

02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:59.585
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS PER

02:00:59.652 --> 02:01:01.520
YEAR AND TREE TRIMMING. ONE

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:02.622
POINT THREE ONE POINT SEVEN

02:01:02.688 --> 02:01:05.725
BILLION. SO THAT'S GOING TO GO

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:08.361
ON A PER TUTTI IF WE DON'T DO

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.528
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:12.365
DONE YEARS AGO AND THAT START ON

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:13.666
THE GROUND IN THE LINES. SO THE

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:14.734
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVICE

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.469
TOWARD THE TERRITORY'S ESTY

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:17.970
GENIE SOCAL EDISON PG&amp;E THEIR

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:22.141
BASS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS SIX

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:23.275
. I'M A BIG BELIEVER LOOKING

02:01:23.342 --> 02:01:25.144
FORWARD BUT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:26.846
FORWARD TO GOING TO LEARN FROM

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:28.414
THE PAST WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT

02:01:28.481 --> 02:01:30.650
P. JEANNIE. THEY HAVE VASTLY

02:01:30.716 --> 02:01:32.451
UNDER INVESTED IN HARDENING

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.953
THEIR LINES. THEY HAVE UNDER

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:36.155
INVESTED IN. FOR ME TREE

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:36.989
TRIMMING AROUND THE LINES

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.457
THEY'VE UNDER INVESTED IN FIRE

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.626
SAFETY NAMES UNDER INVESTED IN

02:01:40.693 --> 02:01:44.430
UNDERGROUND. IT'S A NEW DAY. SO

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:46.532
HERE'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:49.402
LITERALLY THE C. E. O. IS SAYING

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.971
THAT SHE WANTS TO UNDERGROUND

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:56.409
TEN THOUSAND MILES OF LINE.

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:59.812
THERE'S NO PLAN. WE NEED TO

02:01:59.879 --> 02:02:01.814
DEVELOP THE PLAN TO GET THE JOB

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:06.419
DONE. 99% REMEMBER THE NUMBER

02:02:06.485 --> 02:02:10.790
99% 99% OF ALL FOREST FIRES.

02:02:10.856 --> 02:02:12.258
THEY DON'T START WINNING

02:02:12.324 --> 02:02:16.429
UNDERGROUND 99% IN WHEN WE TAKE

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:18.864
A LOOK AT WITH THE ADDED USE THE

02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:20.666
OUTAGES. FULL IN NORTHERN

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:21.734
CALIFORNIA ARE LEGALLY GOING

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.436
WEEKS WITHOUT POWER YOU ALL

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:28.207
WEEKS. WE DON'T LIVE IN THE

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:30.676
NATION IT DOESN'T HAVE POWER FOR

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:33.979
WEEKS. AND HOW LONG ARE WE GOING

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.481
TO TOLERATE THIS. WE'RE THE

02:02:35.548 --> 02:02:36.982
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.484
WORLD AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:39.618
HAVE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:41.020
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT

02:02:41.087 --> 02:02:44.657
POWER FOR WEEKS. THIS IS INSANE

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.392
. AND WE'RE ONE OF THE FAILURES

02:02:46.459 --> 02:02:47.426
AND JUST BEING REALLY CANDID

02:02:47.493 --> 02:02:49.695
I'LL GIVE YOU MY BELIEF IN MY

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:51.097
SEVEN YEARS IN THIS LEGISLATORS

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:51.997
NOT HOLDING THIS UTILITY

02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.466
ACCOUNTABLE TO BE ABLE TO FIX

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.434
OUR LINE AND MAKE THE

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:56.602
COMMUNITIES MORE FIRE SAFE. SO

02:02:56.669 --> 02:03:00.940
LOOK NO BILL IS PERFECT. NO I

02:03:01.006 --> 02:03:02.408
DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH THE

02:03:02.475 --> 02:03:04.276
BILLS THAT I HAVE BUT AT THE

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:05.911
SAME TIME THOUGH MY GOD HOW MANY

YEARS IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR US

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:10.583
TO GET. THIS DONE. SO I WANT TO

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:11.984

THAT MAY BE A GOOD IDEA- GIVING

02:15:12.471 --> 02:15:14.906
THE EYES SO THE PRESUMPTION- A

02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:16.341
REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT WHEN

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:17.909
THEY IDENTIFY SOMETHING IS

02:15:17.976 --> 02:15:18.643

THAT'S A GOOD IDEA- AND- YOU

02:15:22.614 --> 02:15:24.416

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:26.451
WE NEED TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL

02:15:26.518 --> 02:15:27.519
SEQUEL- SIMPLIFICATIONS ARE ALL

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:29.054
GREAT IDEAS. NONE OF THEM

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:30.856
REQUIRE CREATING YET ANOTHER

02:15:30.922 --> 02:15:32.858
AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS YEAH

02:15:32.924 --> 02:15:35.460
AND DO WE AT ONE TIME WE HAD THE

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:37.529
CALIFORNIA POWER AUTHORITY- IT

02:15:37.596 --> 02:15:38.463
WENT NOWHERE WE SPENT A LOT OF

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:40.198
TIME AND RESOURCES. CREATING IT

02:15:40.265 --> 02:15:42.634
NO PROJECT CAME OUT OF IT SO I

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:44.269
WOULD REALLY- WE DO WE DO NOT

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:46.905
HAVE THE TIME OR THE ENERGY RATE

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:48.907
NOW TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:50.141
CREATE YET ANOTHER AUTHORITY

02:15:50.208 --> 02:15:51.710
THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE. IS

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:53.144
ACTUALLY THAT THE RIGHT ANSWER

02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:57.782
TO GETTING THIS. TRANSMISSION

BAKER YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO

02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:06.491
MY COMMENTS BUT- THE AYE THE

02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:08.894
IDEA IS AT THE CENTER WORKING

02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.562
WITH COMMITTEE IS GOING TO COME

02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:11.997
UP WITH A BILL THAT ALL ANALYZE

02:16:12.063 --> 02:16:12.998
HOW TO ACT EXPEDITE

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:15.500
TRANSMISSION. HOW TO IDENTIFY IT

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:18.103
WHERE IT'S NEEDED AND HOW TO GO

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:21.239
ABOUT- DOING THAT IN A IN A MORE

02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:22.874
EFFICIENT. MANNER MORE COST

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:25.443
EFFECTIVE MANNER AND SO THE IDEA

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:28.613
IS TO- TO ANALYSIS AND THAT HAVE

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:31.116
A STUDY COME BACK WITH SOME

02:16:31.182 --> 02:16:31.750
RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:34.119
NOT ACCOMPLISH THAT. SO IT'S NOT

02:16:34.185 --> 02:16:36.588
IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE. THE CREATION

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:38.990
OF AN AGENCY BUT IT IT DOESN'T

02:16:39.057 --> 02:16:41.693
NECESSARILY DICTATE THAT THAT BE

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.428
THE ONLY WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:46.798
AGAIN IF- IF WE GO DOWN THIS

02:16:46.865 --> 02:16:49.334
PATH AND ASK FOR A VERY-

02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:51.269
THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS IS

02:16:51.336 --> 02:16:52.971
DONE WE WOULD LIKE EVERYTHING TO

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:54.806
BE ON THE TABLE. THAT WE GET

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.708
ANOTHER ANALYSIS IT GETS TO THE

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.277
CRUX OF HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:00.879
THIS STATE SCHOOLS OF. OF

02:17:00.946 --> 02:17:02.714
CREATING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AT

02:17:02.781 --> 02:17:05.483
THE MOST FISHING COSTS AND MOST

02:17:05.550 --> 02:17:09.220
EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY- AND

02:17:09.287 --> 02:17:10.689
BASICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT THE

02:17:10.755 --> 02:17:12.757
STRATEGY IS TO DO THAT OR WHAT

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:14.693
THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN-

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:17.796

GOOD SO WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT-

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:56.234

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:58.637
KENNEDY WITH THE- ROLE COUNTY

02:17:58.703 --> 02:17:59.304
WERE SET REPRESENTATIVES OF

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:04.843
CALIFORNIA- MISTER KENNEDY AGAIN

WITH RC RC AND ALTERNATIVE IN MY

02:18:08.546 --> 02:18:10.548
COMMENTS TO WHAT WAS SUGGESTED.

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:12.384
STILL TRYING TO WORK MY WAY

02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:14.552
THROUGH IT AND SEE- HOW THIS

02:18:14.619 --> 02:18:16.788
COULD END UP. I THINK WE ARE

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:18.323
GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:20.191
AUTHOR'S INTENT IS TO DRIVE DOWN

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:21.359
COSTS AND TO EXPEDITE THESE

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:23.862
PROJECTS. WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:25.130
WITH ENERGY AFFORDABILITY IN A

02:18:25.196 --> 02:18:27.165
LOT OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:28.867
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:31.670
WITH- WITH DELAYS AND

02:18:31.736 --> 02:18:33.672
RELIABILITY SO WE'RE VERY

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:35.206
INTERESTED IN GETTING TO THE

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:37.008
CORE PROBLEM HERE AND FINDING

02:18:37.075 --> 02:18:38.610
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO GET THERE.

02:18:38.677 --> 02:18:40.578
BUT I THINK EVEN WITH THE A

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:42.280
STUDY WE WOULD STILL HAVE MAJOR

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:43.915
CONCERNS OF THE MODEL INVOLVES

02:18:43.982 --> 02:18:45.583
THE STATE AS AN AUTHORITY WHO'S

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:47.619
DOING THESE THINGS- AND OUR

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:48.687
CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE THE

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:50.288
DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS ON LOCAL

02:18:50.355 --> 02:18:52.223
GOVERNMENTS. FIRST IF THE STATE

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.825
IS INVOLVED IS THE AUTHORITY

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:56.294
OWNING THESE FACILITIES- THOSE

02:18:56.361 --> 02:18:57.862
ARE EXEMPT FROM LOCAL ZONING

02:18:57.929 --> 02:18:59.330
LAWS AND THAT WOULD EXEMPT THEM

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:01.499
FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY TO COME IN

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:03.334
AND DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE

02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:05.236
PLANS WITH THOSE FACILITIES. ARE

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:07.005
CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL PRIORITIES

02:19:07.072 --> 02:19:09.040
AND OBJECTIVES SECOND IF THE

02:19:09.107 --> 02:19:10.742
STATE IS INVOLVED IN OWNERSHIP

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:12.577
IT WOULD- INVOLVED IN A HIT TO

02:19:12.644 --> 02:19:14.546
LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES.

02:19:14.612 --> 02:19:16.247
WHICH IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:17.415
PROVISION OF LOCAL EMERGENCY

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:19.584
SERVICES SO AGAIN IF THE STATE

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:21.586
IS THE ONE WHO IS RUNNING THIS

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:23.188
OWNING THE LAND. THEN WE HAVE

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:24.556
SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THE

02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:26.658
DOWNSTREAM IMPLICATIONS. UNLESS

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.460
THEIR PROPERTY TAX BACKFILL AND

02:19:28.526 --> 02:19:30.128
LAST THOSE PROJECTS ARE SUBJECT

02:19:30.195 --> 02:19:32.130
LOCAL ZONING AS WELL. AND THEN

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:33.631
FINALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE

02:19:33.698 --> 02:19:34.499
AUTHOR SUGGESTED ABOUT

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.835
LIABILITY- I DON'T THINK ANYONE

02:19:36.901 --> 02:19:38.503
WANTS THE STATE TO TAKE ON

02:19:38.570 --> 02:19:39.671
GREATER LIABILITY AND SO LOOK

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:41.206
FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH THOSE

02:19:41.272 --> 02:19:43.775
ISSUES AS WELL- WOULD LOVE TO

AND- RECONSIDER POSITION

02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:50.148
ACCORDINGLY BUT- I THINK IF IT.

02:19:50.215 --> 02:19:52.150
INVOLVES THE STATE AND- THE

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:54.586
