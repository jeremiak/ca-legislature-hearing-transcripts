GOVERNOR ADVANCING THIRTEEN FIRE

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:09.862

SEVENTY FIVE IN THE STATE -- SO

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.141
WHERE.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.876
WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.945

THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.800
REDUCE STRESS FOR ALL

FIREFIGHTERS BY INCREASING NOT

00:09:30.469 --> 00:09:31.604

TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ARE.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.725
THERE IS STILL A GREAT RISK AND

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.227
WHEN MY FIREFIGHTERS TRAVELED

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:33.666

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.567
EIGHT OTHER TALENTS SOME THE

FARTHEST DISTRICT DISTANCES AND

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.475
TO HELPING.

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.777
FIRST OF ALL PROTECT A DEFENDANT

FIREFIGHTERS RETURN HOME SOONER.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:50.316

I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH.

00:10:55.888 --> 00:10:57.156
MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:57.456
[inaudible]

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.225
AND JUST.

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:00.993
MAKE ONE NOTE WE'VE BEEN BEATING

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.595
HIS DRUM I THINK ALL YEAR TALK

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:03.696
WITH LA -- ABOUT IN THE

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.232
ADMINISTRATION.

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.801
RIGHT SIZING THE SCOPE OF OUR

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.836
RESILIENCY BUDGET OVERALL

00:11:10.903 --> 00:11:12.338
WHETHER IT'S ON THE SUPPRESSION

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.740
SIDE ON PREVENTION SIDE LOOKING

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:16.075
IN MITIGATION.

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:18.577
I THINK WE NEED OVERALL A RESET

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:20.279
ABOUT.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:23.315
WHAT IS A LOT OF IT WHAT'S A LOT

00:11:23.382 --> 00:11:24.817
AND WHAT ISN'T AND I FRANKLY

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.420
THINK ALL THIS IS UNDERSIZED THE

00:11:27.486 --> 00:11:29.288
FACT THEY WERE FORCED TO TO SORT

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:30.389
OF FIGHT IN THESE?

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.725
NARROW POTS FOR FUNDING WHEN

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:34.794
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CRISIS STATE

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.028
BUSINESS DATA CALIFORNIA CLIMATE

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.263
CHANGES HERE.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.365
NOT GOING ANYWHERE TO ACTUALLY

00:11:39.432 --> 00:11:41.300
GOING TO GET WORSE SO -- FULLY

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.768
SUPPORT THAT BUT JUST IN THIS

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.303
BROADER CONTEXT IS AS WE GO

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.438
THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:46.705
PRODUCTION FUND WE LOOK AT OUR

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:47.973
PRICE OF CARBON AND WHERE IT IS

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.742
RIGHT NOW IN THIS STATE WHICH IS

00:11:49.809 --> 00:11:51.343
ACTUALLY NOT THE SOCIAL COST OF

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.945
CARBON SEXY HALF OF WHAT.

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:55.147
THE TRUE COST OF CARBON IS AND

00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.115
MORE BROADLY ABOUT OUR

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.550
STRATEGIES AND RESILIENCY FUNNY

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.853
I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO LIFT.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.354
ALL ENGINES AND THE REST OF IT

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:03.956
AT THE SAME TIME BUT WE'RE GONNA

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:06.158
NEED THAT ANALYSIS SO.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:06.459
JUST.

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:08.260
AS THERE BEEN ANY FURTHER

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.563
THINKING IN AT A DEAL WHERE FOR

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:11.931
AT IT AND ELLIE -- OR EVEN I

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.433
KNOW WE HAVE -- P. R. HERE TODAY

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:14.967
AS WELL.

00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.368
WHAT THE SORT OF HOW TO HAVE A

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:17.636
PROPER NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.271
WHETHER WERE ACTUALLY UNDER

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:25.778
SHOOTING ALL OF THIS?

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:26.679
STEPHEN BENSON DEPARTMENT FINDS

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.881
LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT IN A

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:29.849
PREVIOUS HEARING.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.184
HOW FIRE IS AS A KIND OF A?

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.086
SPIN OFF BUT IT IS A PART OF THE

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.254
THE STRATEGIC PLAN THEY FINISH

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.622
THEIR GOING TO BE STARTING TO

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:37.723
WORK ON KIND OF THE LARGER.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.458
ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:40.593
STATEWIDE NEED MORE THAN MAYBE

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:42.528
GAPS AND I THINK THAT'S

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.163
SOMETHING WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.398
TO TRY AND GET TO THIS KIND OF

00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:50.136
RIGHT SIZING CONCEPT -- I THINK.

00:12:50.202 --> 00:12:51.137
CAN BUILDING OFTEN COMMENT YOU

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:51.537
MADE TO ME IN THE

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.638
ADMINISTRATION'S OVERALL

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:54.373
FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUDGET WAS

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.242
THAT OF RESILIENCY WE WANT TO

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:57.943
MAKE SURE THAT.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.445
WHEN WE DO ONGOING INVESTMENTS

00:12:59.512 --> 00:13:01.013
WERE KIND OF KEEPING IN LINE

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.048
WITH WHAT THE ON GOING REVENUE

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.483
LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK THE LAST

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.018
THING YOU WANT TO DO IS INVEST?

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:07.419
IN A BUNCH OF THESE TYPES OF

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:08.487
RESOURCES AND THEN FIND OUT

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.856
ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN AND NOW WE'RE

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:11.390
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.158
THINGS OUT OF THE BUDGET.

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.326
WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE IN

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:14.927
A POSITION WHERE WE'RE LOOKING

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:15.694
AT THAT AGAIN.

00:13:15.761 --> 00:13:18.397
I THINK YOU WELL I CAN'T COMMENT

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:19.465
TO WHAT THE MINISTRATION WE

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.066
PROPOSING OVER THE NEXT TO YOU

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:21.767
KNOW BUDGET.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.903
CYCLES I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:25.404
THIS CONVERSATIONS NOT GOING

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:27.740
AWAY -- THIS ISSUES NOT REALLY

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:28.807
GOING AWAY AND SO WE'RE

00:13:28.874 --> 00:13:29.542
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.376
BE.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.243
TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT A

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.111
TRACKING IT IS THE NEEDS

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.280
ASSESSMENT STUFF IS DEVELOPING

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.514
COMES OUT THAT'S GOING TO BE AN

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.082
IMPORTANT TOOL TO US IN FIGURING

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:38.250
OUT WHERE TO INVEST.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:39.718
THIS PROPOSAL WAS REALLY ABOUT

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.320
TRYING TO SAY WITHIN THAT

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.922
FRAMEWORK OF MAINTAINING BUDGET

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.224
RESILIENCY WHAT KIND OF A

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:48.394
COLLECTION OF INVESTMENTS WE CAN

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.862
MAKE IN SOME NEEDED AREAS AND SO.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:50.696
ALL THAT AVIATION WAS IMPORTANT

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:53.866
WE FELT THAT INVESTING IN THE

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.401
HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF THE OF

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:56.135
THE FIREFIGHTERS.

00:13:56.202 --> 00:13:57.970
WE'RE THE VERY IMPORTANT ENGINES

00:13:58.037 --> 00:13:58.637
IS ALWAYS VERY IMPORTANT STEP.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:13:59.338
THERE'S JUST A WHOLE LOT OF

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:00.839
AREAS WHERE THIS IS SUPER

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:06.779
CRITICAL AND TRYING TO KEEP

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.414
WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK RESILIENCY.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.015
WE TRY TO DO A BALLOT -- AND

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:10.783
THAT WAS REALLY A FRAMEWORK AND

00:14:10.849 --> 00:14:11.750
I AGAIN LIKE I SAID I I DON'T

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:12.451
EXPECT THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.186
YEARS THIS CONVERSATION IS GOING

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:15.221
ANYWHERE WORK AND HAVE TO

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.755
CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT IN HERE

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:18.490
TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP

00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:20.326
ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:21.594
AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.329
ASK IS AS CAL FIRE GOES THROUGH

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:24.496
ITS TEACHING THREE THINKING TO

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:24.964
MAKE IT INTEGRATIVE.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.131
THINK ABOUT HOW TO UTILIZE THE

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:26.765
OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.100
TO LEAN ON THE RESOURCES AGENCY

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.969
RIGHT TO LOOK AT SORT OF OTHER

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:31.136
AGENCIES WITH.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:34.607
THE SORT OF BROADER STAKE IN.

00:14:34.673 --> 00:14:35.341
AND NOT JUST THE BUDGET

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.542
RESILIENCY BUT THE ACTUAL

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.344
PHYSICAL CLIMATE RESILIENCY THE

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:37.796
JANUARY BUDGET -- AND WE'RE

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:38.997
TALKING ABOUT THOSE COMBINED

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:40.599
BUDGETS NOT JUST MAY AND IN THE

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.267
JANUARY BUDGET ON A MAJOR FOCUS

00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:43.902
ON FOREST MANAGEMENT AND FIRE OF

00:21:43.969 --> 00:21:45.303
COURSE I'M COMING OUT OF NINE A

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.105
ONE BUT ALSO JUST COMING OUT OF

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:47.906
THE WORST FIRE SEASON THAT WE

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:48.740
SEE IN.

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.976
EVER IN CALIFORNIA IN RECORDED

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:51.743
HISTORY.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.011
THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.813
CONTINUED IN THE MAY REVISED IN

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.614
FIRE.

00:21:55.681 --> 00:21:57.649
PARTICULARLY ON PREVENTION AND

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.384
RESILIENCE ARE REALLY CRITICAL

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:01.153
THOSE ARE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH

00:22:01.219 --> 00:22:02.554
MITIGATION FIRES AGAIN OR WHEN A

00:22:02.621 --> 00:22:03.855
BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO GREENHOUSE

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:05.123
GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.625
BUT ALSO IN CLIMATE RESILIENCE

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:08.393
WE KNOW THAT THE FIRES WILL

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.828
BECOME MORE SEVERE AND MORE

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.630
FREQUENT GOING FORWARD.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:12.631
AND THESE INVESTMENTS WE SEE AS

00:22:12.698 --> 00:22:15.333
A KEY PART OF A LARGER

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.535
RESILIENCE STRATEGY.

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.336
YOU'LL ALSO SEE.

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:20.038
I'M IN I BE IN THE JANUARY

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.273
BUDGET AND OF COURSE CONTINUE

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.674
THROUGH ON TWO MAY I THIS

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.409
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE

00:22:24.476 --> 00:22:25.377
SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM THAT'S

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.945
REALLY DIRECT INVESTMENT IN.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.180
IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

00:22:28.246 --> 00:22:30.582
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.083
THAT GOES THROUGH THESE

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.717
INVESTMENTS.

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.652
THE MAJOR AREAS INCREASES IN MAY

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.020
ON THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT ARE

00:22:35.087 --> 00:22:38.090
AS FOLLOWS. ONE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:39.091
INCREASE IN THE TRANSFORMATIVE

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.525
CLIMATE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM.

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.561
BRINGING THE OVERALL PROGRAM TWO

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:43.195
HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION WHICH

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.130
IS NEAR IT NOT QUITE AT BUT NEAR

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:47.532
WHAT THE PROGRAM WAS IN ITS

00:22:47.599 --> 00:22:48.834
FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.501
THE REASON THAT WE THE

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:50.802
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOCUSED IN ON

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:51.703
THIS PROGRAM IS THAT IT'S IN

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.038
SOME WAYS IT'S A MICROCOSM THAT

00:22:53.105 --> 00:22:54.172
BRINGS OGETHER ALL OF THE

00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:55.273
DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT WE ALL

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.475
TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.943
CLIMATE MITIGATION AND

00:22:58.009 --> 00:22:59.611
RESILIENCE IT'S A A PROGRAM THAT

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:01.012
IS DONE AFTER COMMUNITY.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.481
SCALE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER KEY

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:03.849
PRIORITIES OF FOCUS ON

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:04.916
INTEGRATING HOUSING

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:06.785
TRANSPORTATION GREEN SPACES AND

00:23:06.852 --> 00:23:08.253
CLIMATE RESILIENCE.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.988
IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WITH

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.990
A BOTTOM UP APPROACH SO WE HEARD

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.592
IN THE AIR BE IN A LISTENING

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:14.626
TOUR LAST YEAR.

00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.394
ON AYE PRIORITIES ACROSS THE

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:17.462
STATE FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.030
REDUCTION FIND HEARD OVER AND

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.365
OVER AGAIN THAT PEOPLE WANTED

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:21.633
COMMUNITY SCALE PROJECTS THEY

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.968
WANTED TO DECIDE.

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:24.569
WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR

00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:25.904
THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THIS

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:28.573
PROGRAM DOES NOT IT'S A VERY

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.309
COMMUNITY SCALP PROGRAM?

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:32.377
WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS.

00:23:32.444 --> 00:23:33.879
ACROSS THE PROJECT.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.580
IN ON EVERYONE OF THE PROJECT

00:23:35.647 --> 00:23:37.549
HAS HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.785
OR GREEN SPACES -- INVOLVED IN

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:40.619
THERE'S A SPECIFIC FOCUSING

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:41.720
REDUCING THIS VEHICLE MILES

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:42.988
TRAVELED NUMBER THROUGH PROJECTS

00:23:43.054 --> 00:23:45.223
AND INCORPORATE MOBILITY OPTIONS

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.824
INCLUDING WALKING BIKING AND

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:46.758
TRANSIT.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:48.059
THAT IS CRITICAL AS A

00:23:48.126 --> 00:23:49.227
DEMONSTRATION OF HOW YOU CAN DO

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.729
THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:52.531
THINK VERY CLOSELY RELATED TO

00:23:52.597 --> 00:23:53.865
THE LARGER HOUSING AGENDA THAT

00:23:53.932 --> 00:23:55.000
THE STATE HAS HOW DO WE BUILD

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:55.767
HOUSING.

00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:57.102
MORE SUSTAINABLY HOW DO WE DO

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:00.238
KIND OF GROSS LOOKING FORWARD.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.273
TO TWENTY FIFTY ANOTHER BIG AREA

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:02.974
OF INCREASE ON IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:05.110
BUDGET IS ON IS REALLY GETS TO

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:06.278
THIS EQUITY ISSUE BUT ALSO THE

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:07.546
TRANSPORTATION POINT I MADE

00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:08.713
EARLIER IN A MEASURE.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.981
ON ON EMISSIONS WHICH IS

00:24:10.048 --> 00:24:11.249
DECREASING AIR POLLUTION AND V.

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:13.084
AND EMISSIONS FROM FOR THE

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:14.486
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WITH THE

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:17.122
FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION IN THE

00:24:17.189 --> 00:24:18.423
INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURAL SECTORS.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.125
SO HERE WE HAVE THREE MAJOR

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:23.061
INCREASES ON ONE HI YOU WERE ALL

00:24:23.128 --> 00:24:24.029
OF WHICH ARE AIMED AT HELPING

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.131
TRANSITION VEHICLES TO BE

00:24:26.198 --> 00:24:27.866
CLEANER AND LESS POLLUTING. ONE

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:29.000
MAJOR ONE IS FIFTY MILLION

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:30.335
DOLLAR INCREASE AFTER THE CLEAN

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.636
TRUCKS BUSES AND OFFERED VEHICLE

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:33.572
PROGRAM THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.739
THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE IN THE

00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:36.041
INLAND EMPIRE IN PARTICULAR.

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.976
AND CENTRAL VALLEY AROUND

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:38.910
FREIGHT EMISSIONS.

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:40.712
SECOND IS A SIXTY FIVE MILLION

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:41.746
INCREASE IN ENGINE UPGRADES

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.114
REPLACEMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.282
VEHICLES THAT'S RIGHT AT THAT

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:45.851
INTERSECTION OF AGRICULTURE

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:47.352
TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRY.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.520
IN AN AREA OF THE STATE WERE

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:50.322
POLLUTION STAYS IN THE AIR IN

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:52.023
LOCAL AREAS FOR MUCH LONGER AND

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.391
IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:54.793
AND FINALLY FIFTEEN MILLION

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.228
INCREASE IN THE ENHANCE FLEET

00:24:56.294 --> 00:24:57.863
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM WHICH I

00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.164
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.432
THAT THE VEHICLE RETIREMENT AND

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:01.967
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM SO THIS IS A

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:03.268
REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OUR

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:05.403
LARGER. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.605
STRATEGY.

00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:07.806
THERE ARE TWENTY SIX MILLION

00:25:07.873 --> 00:25:09.674
CARS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.009
TWO MILLION OF THEM ARE OVER

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.143
TWENTY YEARS OLD.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.612
THOSE ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO

00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:15.614
OUR SMOG BROUGHT THE STATE

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.215
PEOPLE WITH THOSE VEHICLES ARE

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:18.750
NOT HIGH INCOME PEOPLE THERE IS

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.485
A NEED FOR PROGRAMS THAT HELP

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:22.153
PEOPLE TRANSITION FROM.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.155
THOSE TYPES OF VEHICLES TO NEWER

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:24.990
VEHICLES THAT ARE MUCH MORE

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.291
EFFICIENT THE PROGRAM GIVES

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.726
INCREASED INCENTIVES FOR

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:29.427
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND REALLY

00:25:29.494 --> 00:25:30.595
GETS US ON THAT ROAD TOWARD.

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:31.696
YOUR REMISSION IT ALSO GIVES I

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.131
SHOULD SAY INCREASE INCENTIVES

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.232
FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS.

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:36.434
AND A INCENTIVE FOR NOT BUYING

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.470
A NEW VEHICLE AT ALL PURCHASE

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:39.871
DISCREPANCY.

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.306
THE THIRD ON AREA OF INCREASE ON

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:42.741
THE ON THE LINE ITEMS IS IN THE

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.509
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR THIS AS YOU

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:45.844
KNOW IS A CRITICAL SECTOR TO

00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:48.280
CALIFORNIA FIFTY MILLION FIFTY

00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:48.914
BILLION SKEWS ME A YEAR TO THE

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.748
ECONOMY.

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.049
THE FOCUS HERE AGAIN IS ON

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.418
PROGRAMS IN THIS CRITICAL AREA

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:54.286
WHERE WE'RE SEEING.

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:55.654
KIND OF STEADY STATE ON

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.588
EMISSIONS WITH SOME REALLY

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.323
IMPORTANT DECREASES BUT ALSO

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.691
JUST INCREASES ON THE DIESEL

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:01.793
SIDE AS I SAID AN INCREASE IN

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.328
THAT AGRICULTURAL DIESEL PROGRAM

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:06.131
BUT ALSO. TO INCREASES THAT ARE

00:26:06.197 --> 00:26:07.832
REALLY GET AT THE HEART OF

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.634
WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE SECTOR AND

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:11.403
FOR OUR CLMATE ONE OF THOSE IS --

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:13.104
INCREASE IN IN A FUNDING FOR

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:14.973
HEALTHY SOILS WHICH IS A REALLY

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.574
IMPORTANT PIECE OF HOW WE THINK

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:18.076
ABOUT THIS LONG TERM QUESTION OF

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:18.910
HOW DO WE ACTUALLY.

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.545
REMOVE CARPET FROM THE ERROR AS

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:22.380
WELL AS A STOPPING THE ADMITTING

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.783
AS MUCH OF IT -- ALSO AT TEN

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.751
MILLION INCREASE IN THE METHANE

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:28.887
REDUCTION PROGRAM.

00:26:28.954 --> 00:26:30.655
IN ADDITION TO THESE SPECIFIC

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:32.624
ITEMS WHICH ARE ALL INCREASES IN

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:34.059
SPECIFIC AGENCY BUDGETS THERE

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.727
ARE TWO AREAS -- I'VE INCREASE

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:37.462
THAT OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.930
GOVERNOR AND AND YOU SEE THESE

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:40.031
THOUGHT ONE OF THESE IN BOTH AND

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.467
BOTH JANUARY IN MAY AND ONE IS

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:43.201
IN ADDITION IN MAY.

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.469
THE FIRST IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:45.937
INCREASE IN PROVIDING WORKFORCE

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.339
TRAINING AND HIGH ROAD TRAINING

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:48.773
PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP IDENTIFY

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.808
AND SUPPORT.

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:52.277
HIGH QUALITY JOBS ACROSS EVERY

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.912
OTHER AREA OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.413
FINING INVESTMENT.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.715
THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO GET TO

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:59.084
THESE EMISSIONS WE KNOW FROM

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.118
RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE IN MY

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:01.052
COLLEAGUE TIM RAINY FROM THE

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:02.053
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.922
HERE TO ANSWER I'M SURE WHAT

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:04.489
WILL BE QUESTIONS ON THIS

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:05.423
PROGRAM.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.624
WE KNOW FROM WORK THAT THE BOARD

00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:07.993
AND OTHERS HAVE DONE THAT THE

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.894
MAJORITY OF JOBS CREATED BY THE

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:11.730
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINDER

00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:12.263
IN CONSTRUCTION.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.965
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:15.633
CONSTRUCTION SECTOR SUFFERS FROM

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.602
A LACK OF QUALIFIED WORKERS TO

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.571
DO GREEN BUILDINGS BUILDING

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:20.972
UPGRADES INC AND OPERATING MADE.

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:21.773
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE IN

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.241
HIGH QUALITY HIGH QUALITY GREEN

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.509
BUILDINGS.

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:26.177
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHERE PEOPLE

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:29.047
WE SEE A LOSS OF EMISSIONS.

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:30.548
GAINES IT WHEN YOU PUT MONEY

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:31.583
INTO EFFICIENCY IT'S ALL WELL

00:27:31.649 --> 00:27:33.218
AND GOOD IF YOU DON'T ADEQUATELY

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:35.920
MAINTAIN THOSE PROJECTS YOU LOSE

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:36.888
THE GAMES.

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:38.223
SO WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT.

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:39.924
THE WORK FORCE OF THE CARBON

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:41.960
NEUTRAL ECONOMY IS A CRITICAL

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.496
PIECE OF ACHIEVING THAT ECONOMY.

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:45.463
YOU'LL SEE IN THE BUDGET IN

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.066
INCREASED SPECIFICALLY AND MAY

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.101
OR AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE WE

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:51.636
NEED TO SEE A DIVERSIFICATION

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:53.838
AWAY FROM AYE AYE VERY HEAVY JOB

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.373
BASED IN THE FOSSIL FUEL

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:55.974
INDUSTRY SO WE CALLED UP KERN

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.208
COUNTY.

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.243
ON BECAUSE IT'S THE NUMBER ONE

00:27:58.309 --> 00:27:59.677
BY FAR AN OIL AND GAS ON IN THE

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:00.445
STATE.

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.479
AND COUNTY IS ALREADY SEEING A

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.114
DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS JOBS

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:04.449
BECAUSE OF AUTOMATION.

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.518
ALSO SEEING A DECLINE BECAUSE OF

00:28:06.584 --> 00:28:07.485
OTHER STATES HAVING A RAMP UP

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.387
I'M PARTICULARLY GAS.

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:10.989
AND ARE I'D CLIMATE POLICIES

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:12.157
OVER THE LONG TERM AS WELL AS

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:13.358
OTHER COUNTRIES AND STATES

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:14.392
CLIMATE POLICIES HAVE BEEN

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.560
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE OIL AND GAS

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:17.095
SECTOR AS SOMETHING THAT WILL

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.063
AFFECT THE INDUSTRY.

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:19.564
SO WE PUT AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:21.766
THERE FOR A TRANSITION STRATEGY

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:22.667
IN THOSE AREAS OF THE STATES

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.102
WHERE THERE'S HEAVY DEPENDENCE

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.839
ON ONE INDUSTRY -- THAT IS A

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:28.273
HIGH CARBON INDUSTRY

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:28.573
[inaudible]

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.041
IN ADDITION.

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:31.910
YOU'LL SEE A NEW OF FOCUS IN THE

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:33.711
MAPLE REVISE FOR ANOTHER PIECE

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:35.747
OF THE PUZZLE ON HOW DO WE GET

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:36.281
THERE HOW TO GET TO CARBON

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:36.915
NEUTRAL.

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:38.850
I'M AND THAT'S AT ONE POINT FIVE

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:42.053
MILLION A NEW -- ALLOCATION FOR

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.254
A STUDY THAT WILL PROVIDE A

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:44.989
ROADMAP OF HOW TO KERR

00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.157
TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL

00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.592
ECONOMY BY TWENTY FIFTY WITH A

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:49.027
FOCUS WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:49.627
IS.

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:51.029
ON BOTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.230
THE ECONOMIC FACTORS AND YOU'LL

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.065
SEE THAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED THAT

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:55.800
THE AGENCIES ACROSS THE BOARD

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:57.602
INCLUDING LABOR BE PART OF

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:58.736
SCOPING OUT THIS STUDY.

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.004
THE FOCUS WILL BE ON

00:29:00.071 --> 00:29:01.206
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING OUR

00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:03.208
FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND IN THE STATE

00:29:03.274 --> 00:29:03.842
TO REACH THAT CARBON NEUTRALITY

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.944
GOAL BUT ALSO WILL CONSIDER HOW

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.078
THE STATE WILL MANAGE THAT

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:08.446
DECLINE IN FOSSIL FUEL.

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:09.981
SUPPLY THAT DECLINE FOSSIL FUEL

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:12.484
JOBS AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.518
ON SOME OF WHICH IS AS THAT IS

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:14.252
ALREADY HAPPENING THROUGH

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:16.821
AUTOMATION AND MARKET FORCES BUT

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:18.923
WILL LIKELY BE ACCELERATED BY

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.657
THE TYPES OF POLICIES.

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:21.259
NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT OTHER

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:21.893
STATES AND COUNTRIES ARE PUTTING

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.528
IN PLACE.

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.196
SO THAT IS THE HIGH LEVEL.

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:26.865
ANA THE GOVERNOR'S ON PROPOSED

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:27.966
BUDGET AND I KNOW YOU WILL HAVE

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:30.368
MANY QUESTIONS I REALLY WISH I

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:31.035
COULD BE HERE TO ANSWER THEM BUT

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.804
MY VENERABLE COLLEAGUES WHO WILL

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:34.172

PEOPLE AND AND THE ROOM FROM ALL

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:39.911
OF THESE.

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:41.646
AGENCIES SO I WILL.

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:42.347
TURNING TO THEM THEY'RE MUCH

00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:42.947

BROADER FRAMEWORK REVENUE

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:55.660
PROJECTIONS AND KINDA YOU KNOW

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.594
THE NEW MONEY THAT THE

00:29:56.661 --> 00:29:57.729
ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECT IN

00:29:57.795 --> 00:29:59.531
WOULD BE AVAILABLE -- ON THE

00:29:59.597 --> 00:30:01.166
SPENDING SIDE AS WE SAID BEFORE

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:02.800
I MEAN A LOT I THINK A LOT OF

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.169
THE MAJOR DECISIONS ARE AROUND.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.970
JUST DIFFERENT PRIORITIES -- YOU

00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:06.804
KNOW HOW THE LEGISLATURE

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.506
PRIORITY PRIORITISE IS A LOT OF

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:09.340
THE IFFERENT BENEFITS THAT

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:10.708
COULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:11.609
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHETHER THEY

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:15.580
BE -- POLLUTION -- ADAPTATION --

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:18.116
RESEARCH THOSE ARE ALL ALL KIND

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.117
OF WERE THE GOALS AND NOBODY'S

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.051
PROGRAMS CAN ACHIEVE THOSE

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:21.152
THINGS IT'S A LARGE THE AMERICAN

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:22.820
HOW TO PRIORITIZE THOSE THINGS.

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:25.190
ON THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK IN THE

00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:26.891
REVENUE I JUST SOME HIGH LEVEL

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:29.227
NUMBERS HERE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:30.662
RELATIVE TO THE JANUARY PROPOSAL

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:32.297
IS PROJECTING ABOUT SEVEN

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:33.364
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:36.067
DOLLARS MORE AN AUCTION REVENUE

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:36.634
OVER THE CURRENT YEAR IN THE

00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:37.569
BUDGET YEAR.

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.370
AND SO SINCE 60% OF THAT IS

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:40.772
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THAT

00:30:40.838 --> 00:30:42.340
LEAVES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.775
MILLION DOLLARS MORE FOR

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.043
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THE

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:46.444
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.146
ALLOCATE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.814
MILLION OF THAT THREE HUNDRED

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.149
MILLION.

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.418
IN GENERAL WE ARE REVENUE

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:55.053
ESTIMATES ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:56.721
ADMINISTRATION'S PARTICULARLY IN

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.324
THE BUDGET YEAR -- AND THE

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.291
PRIMARY DIFFERENCE I THINK

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:01.392
BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES AND

00:31:01.459 --> 00:31:03.361
THERE'S ARE IN THE CURRENT YEAR --

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:06.464
FOR THE AUCTION THAT JUST

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.465
OCCURRED YESTERDAY.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.967
BASED ON KIND OF CURRENT MARKET

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:10.435
CONDITIONS WERE PROJECT IN --

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:13.304
REVENUE WOULD BE ROUGHLY --

00:31:13.371 --> 00:31:14.072
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:16.174
HIGHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:17.141
IS ASSUMING AND THAT'S ESTIMATES

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:18.943
AND SO THAT LEAVES AGAIN WITH

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.577
TAKING A CONTINUOUS

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:21.713
APPROPRIATIONS OFF ABOUT SIXTY

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:22.981
MILLION DOLLARS MORE.

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:25.183
FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:31.889
THE CURRENT YEAR OR AND SHE'S IN

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:34.492
THE BUDGET OR IN FUTURE YEARS.

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.059
THERE'S A YOUNG AS WE TALKED

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:35.293
ABOUT.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.294
MANY TIMES BEFORE THERE'S A LOT

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:36.894
OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.696
WHAT REVENUE IS GOING TO BE --

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:39.330
ANDS FOR THE MAY AUCTION THE ONE

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.598
THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO RESULTS

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:41.232
FROM THAT OPTION ARE EXPECTED TO

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.066
BE AVAILABLE NEXT.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.802
WEDNESDAY -- AND SO WHEN WE GET

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:45.770
THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT'S

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:47.005
AVAILABLE WE'LL UPDATE THE

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.140
LEGISLATURE WITH WITH UPDATED

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:50.141
REVENUE ESTIMATES.

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:53.177
OKAY -- WE HAVE A CONTINUING

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.979
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE USE OF

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.781
FUNDS IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY

00:31:56.848 --> 00:32:02.754
BUDGET -- FOR PROJECTS.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.322
WHERE THE PROJECTS THAT MIGHT

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:07.125
NOT OF MEAT IS STRICT NEXUS

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:13.131
THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER A. B.?

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:13.865
THIRTY TWO IS IT STILL YOUR

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:16.200
OPINION THAT THE FUNDING

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:18.736
PROPOSAL WOULD -- IN NINETEEN

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.438
TWENTY SHOULD IT HERE TO THE

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:23.007
CONSTRAINTS OF AB THIRTY TWO

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:25.343
BECAUSE MUCH OF THIS MUCH SOME

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.245
OF THE PROJECT I OBJECTS AND

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:27.812
I'VE COMMENTED.

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:31.449
PUBLICLY ABOUT THE BEING STINGY

00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:33.318
ABOUT.

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:34.686
A HEARING TO THE RULE OF LAW

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:37.121
THAT WERE THAT WERE BOUND TO IN

00:32:37.188 --> 00:32:41.793
THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR.

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:43.528
I MEAN I I THINK IT'S IT'S A

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:45.029
LEGAL QUESTION WHERE THERE IS

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:46.931
SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.399
WHAT IT IS YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.268
THE RESTRICTIONS ARE ON THE

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.569
FUNDS NOW I KNOW.

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:52.670
LET'S COUNCIL IS GONNA HAS

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:54.138
WEIGHED IN ON THIS AND AND

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:56.040
THINKS THAT THE FUNDS NEED TO BE

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.408
SPENT ON ON A. B. THIRTY TWO

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.277
RATED ACTIVITIES AND GREENHOUSE

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:02.547
GAS REDUCTIONS I THINK.

REDUCTION.

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:50.646

DAIRIES.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.724
WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THOSE

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.460
DIE GESTURES THROUGH THE HELP

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.895
ARE GONNA BE LOS LARGER DAIRIES.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.830
IN WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS AT FOUR

01:01:07.897 --> 01:01:08.464
HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.099

INVESTED IN PRIVATE FINDS BE

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:13.870
ABLE TO MATCH THAT.

01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:16.873
THE LAST TWO YEARS HAS BEEN

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:17.673
NINETY NINE MILLION INVESTED

AS WELL AS THEIR DIE JESTERS.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:22.779
WE KNOW THAT IT IS ALSO ONE OF

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.247
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE TOOLS

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:25.181
THAT WE HAVE.

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:28.017
WHEN IT COMES REDUCING THAT THAT

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:28.718
CARBON FOOTPRINT?

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.987
IN WHAT THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:33.056
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS IT WE HAVE

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.157
A MANDATE ON INDUSTRY THAT.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:37.293
GENERATES ABOUT 8% OF OUR TOTAL

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.828
FOOTPRINT.

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:41.064
I EN DID NOW HANDICAPPING ON

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.366
ONLY ALLOW ONE ON ONE AREA IN

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.634
THIS MANNER MANAGEMENT

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:44.934
[inaudible]

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.738
SO I AND WE HAVE YOUR BOX I'M

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.107
GRATEFUL THAT WE'VE.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:53.943
OR AT THE THIRTY FIVE BUT ON

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.079
THIS PROGRAM IS ALREADY OVER

01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:59.715
PRESCRIBED -- EXCUSE ME

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:00.750
OVERSUBSCRIBED.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:01.584
COMPARED TO WHERE WE REALLY

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:02.985
SHOULD BE SO I HAVE SOME

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.287
CONCERNS AND UNDERSTAND IS GONNA

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.722
NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.725
HERE -- AS THIS MAKES IT WAY TO

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:12.728
THE LARGER COMMITTEE -- AGAIN I

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.764
THINK THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:16.466
WE HAVE PUT A MANDATE.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.367
UNDERSTANDABLY SO.

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:19.702
ON TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE.

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:21.971
THOSE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.840
POLLUTANTS.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:26.042
AND I PRIOR TO ACTUALLY ROLLING

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.844
OUT WHAT THAT REDUCTION PLANS

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.712
GOING TO BE OR CUTTING BACK THE

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:30.279
FUNDING.

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:32.582
AND NOT PUTTING THE FLEXIBILITY

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.250
AS WE TRADITIONALLY HAD OVER THE

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.585
LAST THREE YEARS THE FIRST YEAR

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:38.187
WE HAD FIFTY MILLION THE LAST.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:38.821
TWO EIGHT NINETY NINE THE STILL

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.255
HAS.

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.090
REAL CONCERNS -- IN REGARDS TO

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:41.691
THAT.

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.359
IN I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.527
NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE.

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:47.563
GREATER DISCUSSION BUT WITHIN

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:48.631
BUDGET SUB.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.366
THE OTHER ITEM I WILL SAY IS

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.567
ALSO.

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:52.735
HAPPENED WILL SEE THE EREKLE TO

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:53.669
DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:54.804
UPGRADE PROGRAM BACK IN THE

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:55.771
NINETY MILLION.

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:56.973
IS THAT IS CRITICAL TO BE ABLE

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.407
TO MEET THE NEEDS PARTICULARLY

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.575
IN RURAL AND AGRICULTURAL

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:00.943
CALIFORNIA.

THAT JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:06.516
THE METHANE REDUCTION SIMPLY

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:11.854
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE ARE --

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.656
SURELY MANY CONSTRAINTS UNDER

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:14.957
THAT PROGRAM THERE'S STILL MORE

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:17.193
WORK TO COME.

ALTHOUGH I DON'T HAVE IT IN MY

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:24.667
DISTRICT I DON'T THINK I MEAN

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:25.968
LARGE JERRY'S BUT I DO HAVE

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.638
SEVERAL SMALLER A SPECIALTY

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:32.175
DERRY'S -- YOU KNOW SO I AM KIND

THE INDUSTRY.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.913
THE LARGE DIE GESTURES SEEM TO

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.347
BE AN IMPORTANT ASPECT TO ME I
