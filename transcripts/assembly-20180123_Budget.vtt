I WE DID GET GOOD NEWS

00:29:45.951 --> 00:29:48.353 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY.

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:50.122 region:rollup2
WITCHES THAT CHIP WAS

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.756 region:rollup2

FREQUENTLY THAT TRANSLATES INTO

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.651 region:rollup2
A CAUTIOUS TO STATES SO WILL

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.987 region:rollup2

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:30.922 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IN AREAS SUCH AS

CONSERVATION APPROVING HUNTING

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:33.858 region:rollup2
AND FISHING CONNECTING MORE

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:35.360 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS WITH THE OUTDOORS.

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:37.328 region:rollup2
AN INCREASING STABILITY AND

SERVICES FOR THE PUBLIC

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:40.198 region:rollup2
INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:41.699 region:rollup2
LASTLY DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND

RECREATION RECEIVES ADDITIONAL

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:45.436 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ALSO UNDER SB ONE THE

00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:46.871 region:rollup2
BUDGET INCLUDES AN INITIAL

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:48.940 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF FIFTY FOUR MILLION

00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:50.908 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF THESE FUNDS. OF WHICH

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.809 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO MILLION WOULD BE

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:53.478 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR INCREASING

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:55.613 region:rollup2
SERVICES ACROSS A VARIETY OF

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:59.817 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS EMPHASIZING THOSE THAT

00:41:55.613 --> 00:42:01.419 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY BENEFIT PARK PATRONS.

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:03.321 region:rollup2
LASTLY OUR NOTE OF CAUTION THEY

00:42:01.419 --> 00:42:04.155 region:rollup2
OFTEN USE THIS CHART AND IT'S

00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:05.990 region:rollup2
JUST A REMINDER THAT THE

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:07.625 region:rollup2
HISTORIC TOWARD TREND IS THAT

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.627 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:11.562 region:rollup2
BALANCED BUDGETS. HAVE BEEN

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:13.231 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY HUGE DEFICITS YOU

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:14.499 region:rollup2
SEE THE RED LINES WHICH

00:42:13.231 --> 00:42:16.000 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THE DEFICITS FAR

00:42:14.499 --> 00:42:17.735 region:rollup2
OUTNUMBER THE BALLOTS BUDGETS

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.170 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE LINE. AND THAT'S

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:20.438 region:rollup2
REALLY A KEY COMPONENT OF THE

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.473 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:20.438 --> 00:42:24.609 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET IS A ROBUST

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:26.511 region:rollup2
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT AND AS

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:28.012 region:rollup2
AFTER YOU TO HELP US WHETHER.

00:42:26.511 --> 00:42:30.148 region:rollup2
THESE HARD TIMES AND I WOULD

KNOW IN OUR RECESSION SCENARIO

00:42:30.148 --> 00:42:32.683 region:rollup2
EVEN AT THIRTEEN POINT FIVE

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.885 region:rollup2
BILLION WHICH IS CERTAINLY

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:35.686 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO A PLOT IN THE

00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:36.754 region:rollup2
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT. OR

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:38.489 region:rollup2
MODERATE RECESSION IS THAT

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:39.624 region:rollup2
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SO EVEN

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:41.292 region:rollup2
THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME

00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:44.429 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WOULD

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:47.298 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE MADE SHOULD WE FACE A

00:42:44.429 --> 00:42:49.033 region:rollup2
RECESSION. WITH THAT AND HAPPY.

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:51.135 region:rollup2

ON HAVE MAC GOING THE WILL TAKE

00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:56.741 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:58.142 region:rollup2
MR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR

00:42:56.741 --> 00:43:00.077 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING.

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:01.579 region:rollup2
ON JANUARY TWELFTH MY OFFICE

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.580 region:rollup2
PUT OUT OUR OVERVIEW OF THE

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.515 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WE DO EVERY

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.349 region:rollup2
YEAR TO PROVIDE SOME INITIAL

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:07.018 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:08.519 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO DO

00:43:07.018 --> 00:43:10.354 region:rollup2
IS JUST VERY BRIEFLY PROVIDE

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:12.123 region:rollup2
SOME HIGHER LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:13.191 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL.

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:15.059 region:rollup2
AND LET ME START WITH HIS

00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:16.627 region:rollup2
OVERALL BUDGET STRUCTURE. UP I

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:18.296 region:rollup2
THINK YOU CAN SEE IN BY MS

00:43:16.627 --> 00:43:19.397 region:rollup2
COSTAS COMMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:20.932 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:22.900 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WHEN THE ECONOMY TURNS

00:43:20.932 --> 00:43:24.135 region:rollup2
SOUTH NEXT AND I THINK THAT'S

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.102 region:rollup2
THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IT CERTAINLY

00:43:24.135 --> 00:43:26.404 region:rollup2
HAS DRIVEN IS BUDGETARY

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:27.972 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

00:43:26.404 --> 00:43:29.874 region:rollup2
BY OUR ACCOUNT IF YOU THINK

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:30.475 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT SORT OF DISCRETIONARY

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:31.742 region:rollup2
MONIES THAT THEY HAD AVAILABLE

00:43:30.475 --> 00:43:33.044 region:rollup2
TO THEM.

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:34.378 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR PUTS ABOUT FOUR

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:37.448 region:rollup2
FIFTHS OF THAT ARE OVER FOUR

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:39.016 region:rollup2
FIFTHS OF THAT INTO RESERVES.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.585 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES VERY LITTLE LEFT

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:42.887 region:rollup2
OVER FOR EITHER ONE TIME

00:43:40.585 --> 00:43:43.788 region:rollup2
SPENDING OR ONGOING SPENT.

00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:45.356 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S A VERY CAUTIOUS

00:43:43.788 --> 00:43:46.424 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:47.725 region:rollup2
IT'S THE MOST CAUTIOUS THING YOU

00:43:46.424 --> 00:43:49.327 region:rollup2
CAN DO BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE YOU

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:51.295 region:rollup2
NOT SPENDING THEM YOU'RE NOT

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:51.896 region:rollup2
COMMITTING TO A HIGHER BASELINE

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:53.731 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:55.500 region:rollup2
AFFORD.

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:56.801 region:rollup2
WHEN REVENUES HEAD SOUTH.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.603 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO IS MONEY THAT GOES

00:43:56.801 --> 00:44:00.505 region:rollup2
INTO YOUR RESERVE IT'S A CUSHION

00:43:58.603 --> 00:44:01.539 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS BY YOU TIME.

00:44:00.505 --> 00:44:03.441 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH ANY DOWNTURN THAT

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:05.409 region:rollup2
DOES COM.

00:44:03.441 --> 00:44:06.444 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR DOES HAVE SOME ONE

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.678 region:rollup2
TIME SPENDING PRIMARILY ON

00:44:06.444 --> 00:44:09.180 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:10.848 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK ARE BROUGH SOME

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.149 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD PROPOSALS.

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:13.384 region:rollup2
A THAT'S THE NEXT MOST CAUTIOUS

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:14.552 region:rollup2
THING THAT YOU CAN DO WHILE YOU

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.286 region:rollup2
ARE SPENDING THE MONEY THEY'RE

00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:16.754 region:rollup2
NOT AVAILABLE TO GO ON YOUR

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:19.323 region:rollup2
RESERVE YOU'RE NOT COMMITTING

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:21.392 region:rollup2
THEM TO ON ON GOING. A SPENDING.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup2
ANY HAS A VERY FEW ONGOING.

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:24.629 region:rollup2
I COMMITMENTS

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:26.631 region:rollup2
NOW CLEARLY E. YOUR MAKE

00:44:24.629 --> 00:44:28.065 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CHOICES.

00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:29.167 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHAIRMANSHIP HIS CLAIM

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:30.501 region:rollup2
THAT HE PUT OUT IN DECEMBER I

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:32.203 region:rollup2
THINK IT FOLLOWS BASICALLY THAT

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:33.371 region:rollup2
SAME OVERALL STRUCTURE THOUGH.

00:44:32.203 --> 00:44:34.438 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT YOUR RESERVES HOW

00:44:33.371 --> 00:44:35.673 region:rollup2
MUCH YOU WHEN IT'S BEEN FOR

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:37.241 region:rollup2
ONGOING SUCH AS DATA

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.875 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT YOU HAVE

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.677 region:rollup2
LEFT OVER FROM ONGOING

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:40.912 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS SO IT'S IT'S A GOOD

00:44:39.677 --> 00:44:42.780 region:rollup2
WAY TO THINK OVERALL ABOUT THE

00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:44.448 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND THE TRADE OFFS OF

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.083 region:rollup2
DOING? EACH OF THOSE THREE

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:47.552 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.085 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT THESE ARE VERY

00:44:47.552 --> 00:44:49.987 region:rollup2
GOOD TIMES BUDGETARY ONLY

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:52.189 region:rollup2
SPEAKING.

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:54.191 region:rollup2
TAKE A MOMENT TO ENJOY THEM.

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:55.159 region:rollup2
.

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:57.161 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'TMEAN THAT YOU

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:57.762 region:rollup2
SHOULD PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AS

00:44:57.161 --> 00:44:58.329 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS CASA STRESSED AND

00:44:57.762 --> 00:45:00.131 region:rollup2
IN.

00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:01.832 region:rollup2
HER COMMENTS.

00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:03.267 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DO YOU WANT TO PREPARE

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:04.335 region:rollup2
THAT RESERVE YOU WANT TO GET

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:06.370 region:rollup2
READY PAY OFF DEBTS GET READY

00:45:04.335 --> 00:45:07.672 region:rollup2
FOR THAT NEXT DOWNTURN.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.372 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DO HAVE OTHER CHALLENGES

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:10.041 region:rollup2
FACING YOU.

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.108 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S

00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:12.810 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE ACTION AT THE FEDERAL

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
LEVEL ON HEALTH CARE THAT YOU

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.779 region:rollup2
MIGHT WANNA RESPOND TO

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:15.980 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT YOU

00:45:14.779 --> 00:45:17.582 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.417 region:rollup2
WILL A TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:20.585 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY FIVE AND DECISIONS

00:45:19.417 --> 00:45:22.520 region:rollup2
THAT COULD AFFECT YOUR FUTURE

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:23.521 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.323 region:rollup2
SO YOU DO HAVE STILL LOTS A

00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:26.524 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES PENSIONS I'M SURE ALL

00:45:25.323 --> 00:45:27.091 region:rollup2
OF YOU ARE HEARING FROM YOUR

00:45:26.524 --> 00:45:27.959 region:rollup2
LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.827 region:rollup2
YOUR.

00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:31.062 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT CAL

00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:32.997 region:rollup2
STIRS CALPERS RATES WHAT IT'S

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:34.432 region:rollup2
DOING TO THEM SO THERE'S STILL

00:45:32.997 --> 00:45:35.866 region:rollup2
LOTS OF CHALLENGES OUT THERE BUT

00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:37.535 region:rollup2
OUT IF THIS IS A GOOD BUDGET

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:40.271 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:45:37.535 --> 00:45:42.473 region:rollup2
LET ME TURN REVENUES.

00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:43.441 region:rollup2
AT AS MISS COSTA MENTIONED THEY

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.142 region:rollup2
HAD PUT THEIR BUDGET TOGETHER

00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:46.644 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE EVEN KNEW WHAT WAS

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:48.145 region:rollup2
THE FINAL ACTION ON.

00:45:46.644 --> 00:45:49.347 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL TAX LAW.

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.314 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:45:49.347 --> 00:45:51.849 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO FINANCIAL

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:53.384 region:rollup2
MARKETS SINCE THE TIME THAT THEY

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:55.052 region:rollup2
SORT OF PUT THEIR BUDGET TO BAD.

00:45:53.384 --> 00:45:57.321 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SNP'S PROBABLY RISEN

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:58.990 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TEN PERCENT. SO BOTH

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:00.491 region:rollup2
FINANCING MY OFFICER SORT OF

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:02.326 region:rollup2
CONSTANT TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:02.493 region:rollup2
WITH NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN WITH

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:04.395 region:rollup2
NEW.

00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:05.496 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DATA.

00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:07.231 region:rollup2
BUT JUST TO A FOR SOME

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.1000 region:rollup2
PROSPECTIVE IF YOU GO BACK TO

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:10.368 region:rollup2
OUR NOVEMBER OUTLOOK THAT WE

00:46:08.1000 --> 00:46:12.203 region:rollup2
PRESENTED JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO.

00:46:10.368 --> 00:46:13.304 region:rollup2
OUR REVENUES FOR SEVENTEEN

00:46:12.203 --> 00:46:14.972 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:16.540 region:rollup2
BUDGET WINDOW.

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:17.942 region:rollup2
ARE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.478 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN FINANCES

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:22.179 region:rollup2
JANUARY BUDGET NUMBERS.

00:46:20.478 --> 00:46:23.381 region:rollup2
AND TO BE CANDID WITH YOU IF WE

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:26.183 region:rollup2
WERE REDOING THOSE NUMBERS TODAY

00:46:23.381 --> 00:46:27.952 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER.

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:30.755 region:rollup2
RIGHT FINANCES WRONG I THINK

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:32.356 region:rollup2
WHAT IT DOES SUGGEST THOUGH IS

00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:34.258 region:rollup2
YOU DO YOU HAVE.

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:34.892 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF UPSIDE ON THE

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:36.027 region:rollup2
REVENUE NUMBERS WHEN YOU GET TO

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:38.629 region:rollup2
MAY.

00:46:36.027 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL MAY.

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.232 region:rollup2
PEPSI WHAT HAPPENS WITH APRIL

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:42.166 region:rollup2
AND. TO SEE JUST WHERE WE ARE I

00:46:41.232 --> 00:46:43.534 region:rollup2
THINK BOTH OF US WOULD AGREE TO

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:45.303 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:46.837 region:rollup2
BUT GIVEN THAT THERE ISI THINK

00:46:45.303 --> 00:46:47.405 region:rollup2
A LOT OF UPSIDE I THINK IT'S

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:49.507 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR YOUR PLANNING

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:50.274 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:46:49.507 --> 00:46:52.410 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:54.111 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.646 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON ANOTHER REASON I

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:56.914 region:rollup2
RAISE THIS IS BECAUSE THIS

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:58.049 region:rollup2
SITUATION WE HAVE NOW IS VERY

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.017 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU. FACED

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:02.053 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:03.954 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAD EXTRA MONEY.

00:47:02.053 --> 00:47:04.488 region:rollup2
USUALLY A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT HAS

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.489 region:rollup2
TO BE SPENT ON PROP NINETY

00:47:04.488 --> 00:47:07.958 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

00:47:05.489 --> 00:47:09.627 region:rollup2
THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:11.262 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS HALF A NOTS MUCH HAVE

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
AT LEAST HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:13.331 region:rollup2
SOME YEARS WE REPENT ALMOST

00:47:12.363 --> 00:47:14.632 region:rollup2
EVERY ADDITIONAL DOLLAR IN NEW

00:47:13.331 --> 00:47:15.900 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

00:47:14.632 --> 00:47:17.668 region:rollup2
FOR SOME PORTION OF THAT NEW

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.803 region:rollup2
MONEY TOWARDS NINETY EIGHT.

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:21.305 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT THE SITUATION THIS

00:47:18.803 --> 00:47:22.440 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:23.174 region:rollup2
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT'S CALLED

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.675 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE FACTOR YOU DON'T

00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:25.509 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.478 region:rollup2
CATCH UP THAT YOU'VE HAD TO DO

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:29.814 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

00:47:27.478 --> 00:47:31.349 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU DO HAVE EXTRA MONEY.

00:47:29.814 --> 00:47:32.683 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF IT IS IN EFFECT

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:33.484 region:rollup2
FREE FOR YES YOU DON'T HAVE TO

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:35.519 region:rollup2
MAKE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS.

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:37.955 region:rollup2
TO NINETY EIGHT.

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:39.857 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION PROP TOO WHICH

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:41.826 region:rollup2
REQUIRES OUR PAYMENTS INTO THE

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:44.662 region:rollup2
RESERVE AND TO PAY OFF DEBTS.

00:47:41.826 --> 00:47:46.697 region:rollup2
THAT ALSO CAN TAKE A BIG.

00:47:44.662 --> 00:47:48.365 region:rollup2
PIECE OF ANY NEW DOLLAR.

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:50.234 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IF THOSE NEW DOLLARS

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:51.168 region:rollup2
ARE RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:53.170 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST THE WAY THE PROP TWO

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:54.805 region:rollup2
FORMULA WORKS.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.573 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:57.575 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO FULLY FUND THE

00:47:55.573 --> 00:47:58.309 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

00:47:57.575 --> 00:48:00.344 region:rollup2
THAT TOO IS NOT A FACTOR RIGHT

00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:02.046 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:03.681 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE POINT I WANT YOU

00:48:02.046 --> 00:48:05.182 region:rollup2
TO WALK AWAY FROM IS IF YOU DO

00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:08.252 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE MONEY WHEN YOU GET TO

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:10.054 region:rollup2
MAY.

00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:11.021 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST ALL DISCRETIONARY

00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:13.124 region:rollup2
MONEY YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:15.025 region:rollup2
WANT WITH IT.

00:48:13.124 --> 00:48:15.693 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SPEND MORE ON SCHOOLS IF

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:17.728 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED YOU COULD PUT IT MORE

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:19.497 region:rollup2
RESERVES. AT INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:21.432 region:rollup2
HEALTH ONIONS WHATEVER YOU WANT

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:23.434 region:rollup2
YOU YOU'RE NOT AS RESTRICTIVE AS

00:48:21.432 --> 00:48:24.969 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.

00:48:23.434 --> 00:48:25.569 region:rollup2
WHEN REVENUES INCREASE BETWEEN

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:27.171 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THE

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.072 region:rollup2
MAY REVISION.

00:48:27.171 --> 00:48:29.774 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.841 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE FOR YOU SO

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:33.277 region:rollup2
JUST TAKE THAT INCOME WHEN YOU

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:34.245 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT DO.

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:37.281 region:rollup2
WITH EVEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:48:34.245 --> 00:48:37.882 region:rollup2
IF WE GOT TO MAY.

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
LET ME TALK FOR A SECOND OUR

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:40.918 region:rollup2
RESERVES. BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.553 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO BUT THREE AND A HALF

00:48:40.918 --> 00:48:44.955 region:rollup2
BILLION AN OPTIONAL PAYMENT INTO

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:46.757 region:rollup2
THE BSA. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:48:44.955 --> 00:48:47.758 region:rollup2
PART OF THEIR PLAN AND OBVIOUSLY

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:50.127 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO BE AN IMPORTANT

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.995 region:rollup2
PART OF YOUR DECISION MAKING.

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:52.029 region:rollup2
NOW THERE'S REALLY TWO KEY

00:48:50.995 --> 00:48:55.166 region:rollup2
ISSUES FIRST WHAT LEVEL OF

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:56.400 region:rollup2
RESERVES DO YOU WANT.

00:48:55.166 --> 00:48:57.701 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT KIND OF RESERVES THE

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.537 region:rollup2
ONE HAVE AT THE END OF THE

00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:00.504 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR?

00:48:59.537 --> 00:49:02.173 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.740 region:rollup2
MAXED OUT THE THE BUDGET

00:49:02.173 --> 00:49:04.708 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OF TEN

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:05.943 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.777 region:rollup2
AND HE ALSO HAS TWO PERCENT IN

00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:08.112 region:rollup2
JUST WHAT WE CALL DISCRETIONARY

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:09.447 region:rollup2
RESERVES.

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:10.948 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TWELVE PERCENT IN

00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:11.916 region:rollup2
RESERVES THAT'S A LEVEL WE

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:13.651 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T REACHED IN IN IN MY

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:14.752 region:rollup2
LIFETIME.

00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:16.487 region:rollup2
ITS A REALLY REMARKABLE

00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:17.521 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT IF YOU WERE TO BUY

00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:19.924 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:20.591 region:rollup2
PROTECTION AGAINST ARE ARE VERY

00:49:19.924 --> 00:49:24.328 region:rollup2
VOLATILE REVENUE.

00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:25.763 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:27.164 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT LEVEL.

00:49:25.763 --> 00:49:28.566 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE HAVE ARGUED IT'S A

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.733 region:rollup2
LOT WE SHOULD BE A LOT MORE.

00:49:28.566 --> 00:49:30.901 region:rollup2
IT'S COSTA MENTION THAT 펟 CAN

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:32.570 region:rollup2
HAVE A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR

00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:33.904 region:rollup2
DOWNTURN PRETTY RAPIDLY.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:34.371 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE SUGGESTED WE SHOULD

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.040 region:rollup2
HAVE GIVEN OUR REVENUE

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:37.308 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
WHICH HAVE A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY

00:49:37.308 --> 00:49:41.145 region:rollup2
OR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT RESERVE.

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:42.880 region:rollup2
NOT THERE'S THERE'S NO RIGHT

00:49:41.145 --> 00:49:44.615 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.951 region:rollup2
IN IN LARGE PART DEPENDS ON YOUR

00:49:44.615 --> 00:49:47.585 region:rollup2
SORT OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES AND

00:49:46.951 --> 00:49:49.720 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT YOU PERCEIVE

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:51.455 region:rollup2
THINGS DO YOU WANT TO PLAN FOR A

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.289 region:rollup2
MODERATE RECESSION.

00:49:51.455 --> 00:49:53.791 region:rollup2
DO YOU WANT A PLAN FOR THE WORST

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:56.060 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE RECESSION

00:49:53.791 --> 00:49:57.761 region:rollup2
WHEN DO YOU THINK IT'S COMING.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.330 region:rollup2
SOON OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS DOWN

00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:00.898 region:rollup2
THE ROAD ALL OF THOSE KIND OF

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.299 region:rollup2
DECISIONS CAN AFFECT WHAT YOU

00:50:00.898 --> 00:50:04.535 region:rollup2
THINK IS THE SORT OF IDEAL

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:06.270 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

00:50:04.535 --> 00:50:07.505 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT GETTING TO AT

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.707 region:rollup2
LEAST THE TEN PERCENT BSA

00:50:07.505 --> 00:50:11.642 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM.

00:50:09.707 --> 00:50:12.877 region:rollup2
IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WOULD BE

00:50:11.642 --> 00:50:13.844 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO AYE

00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:15.646 region:rollup2
AYE WHAT AT THE MINIMUM TRIED TO

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.247 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THAT.

00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:17.414 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER YOU GO BEYOND THAT

00:50:16.247 --> 00:50:18.682 region:rollup2
ARE NOT.

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:20.017 region:rollup2
SORT OF IT HAS TO BE YOUR

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:23.187 region:rollup2
CALCULUS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS

00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:24.488 region:rollup2
THAT I DID MENTION.

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:26.857 region:rollup2
YOU CAN EASILY MAKE THE CASE FOR

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.892 region:rollup2
MORE RESERVES AND IRONICALLY AND

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:29.994 region:rollup2
THIS I THIS IS VERY COUNTER

00:50:27.892 --> 00:50:30.528 region:rollup2
INTUITIVE.

00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:32.763 region:rollup2
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:33.330 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL TO MAX OUT THE RESERVE

00:50:32.763 --> 00:50:34.765 region:rollup2
TO PUT THE THREE AND A HALF

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.066 region:rollup2
BILLION.

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:37.568 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT MORE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:41.372 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BUILD

00:50:37.568 --> 00:50:41.972 region:rollup2
HIGHER RESERVES.

00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:43.140 region:rollup2
AND WE TELL YOU WHY THAT'S THE

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:44.675 region:rollup2
CASE

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.442 region:rollup2
IF YOU MAX OUT YOUR RESERVE IN

00:50:44.675 --> 00:50:47.111 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE BSA AT TEN

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:48.512 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:49.680 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GET TO NINETEEN TWENTY

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.915 region:rollup2
YOU STILL MAY HAVE TO MAKE IN

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.349 region:rollup2
EFFECT PAYMENTS THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:54.251 region:rollup2
SET ASIDE.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:55.052 region:rollup2
FOR RESERVES IN DEBT PAYMENTS

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:57.421 region:rollup2
HOWEVER INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE

00:50:55.052 --> 00:51:00.624 region:rollup2
BSA. THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT

00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:01.825 region:rollup2
ON CAPITAL OUTLAY.

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.726 region:rollup2
NOW THAT COULD BE A REALLY GOOD

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:04.728 region:rollup2
THING WE HAVE LOTS OF CAPITAL

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:05.930 region:rollup2
OUTLAY NEEDS.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:08.265 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT IF YOU WANTED TO BUILD

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.533 region:rollup2
YOUR RESERVE A FIFTEEN PERCENT.

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:11.435 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MAX

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:13.070 region:rollup2
OUT THE BSA MEANS THAT IN AT

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:14.438 region:rollup2
NINETEEN TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.472 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE TO SPEND MONEY THAT

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:17.207 region:rollup2
YOU COULD SET ASIDE FOR

00:51:15.472 --> 00:51:18.042 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESERVES. ON CAPITAL

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:19.243 region:rollup2
OUTLAY WOULD MAKE IT MORE

00:51:18.042 --> 00:51:21.345 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO BUILD

00:51:19.243 --> 00:51:23.047 region:rollup2
HIGHER RESERVES.

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:24.682 region:rollup2
I I I'M NOT RAISING THIS TO AN

00:51:23.047 --> 00:51:26.250 region:rollup2
IF IN TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THE

00:51:24.682 --> 00:51:28.052 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT'S REALLY

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:29.253 region:rollup2
MORE JUST TO NOTE THAT BECAUSE

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:30.854 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE FORMULAS THAT DRIVE

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:32.056 region:rollup2
YOUR BUDGET.

00:51:30.854 --> 00:51:33.891 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S NINETY EIGHT OR

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:36.126 region:rollup2
PROP TO PROP NOW FIFTY FIVE

00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:36.994 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX.

00:51:36.126 --> 00:51:38.595 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DECISION MAKING IS MUCH

00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:40.130 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED IT'S MUCH LESS

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.398 region:rollup2
INTUITIVE.

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.533 region:rollup2
WHO'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:44.468 region:rollup2
INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THESE

00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:45.803 region:rollup2
FORMULAS AND THE WAY THAT THEY

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:47.871 region:rollup2
INTERACT OFTENTIMES NOT AN

00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:49.340 region:rollup2
INTUITIVE WAYS.

00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:51.208 region:rollup2
SO I MENTIONED THAT IT'S JUST A

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:52.943 region:rollup2
REALLY SORT OF INTERESTING

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:55.379 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY COUNTER INTO.

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.846 region:rollup2
INTUITIVE RESULT OF TAKING THE

00:51:55.379 --> 00:51:57.247 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S IN GREEN TO

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:58.349 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S ACTION

00:51:57.247 --> 00:52:01.018 region:rollup2
TO MAX OUT YOUR RESERVE IN

00:51:58.349 --> 00:52:01.852 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:03.420 region:rollup2
LET ME BRIEFLY JUST RAISE A

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:05.589 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.424 region:rollup2
PROP FIFTY FIVE.

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:09.093 region:rollup2
WHICH INCREASED.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:10.861 region:rollup2
HIGH INCOME TAX RATES BUT IT

00:52:09.093 --> 00:52:12.363 region:rollup2
ALSO HAS THIS PROVISION THAT

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:13.964 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ZERO AND TWO BILLION

00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:15.265 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN ANY HERE COULD BE SET

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:17.568 region:rollup2
ASIDE FOR. HEALTH BASICALLY MEDI

00:52:15.265 --> 00:52:19.269 region:rollup2
CAL.

00:52:17.568 --> 00:52:19.770 region:rollup2
AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S CALCUL

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.538 region:rollup2
BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.673 region:rollup2
CALCULATION THAT WOULD BE ZERO

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.640 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND I

00:52:22.673 --> 00:52:24.975 region:rollup2
THINK THEY'VE TENTATIVELY

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.510 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
SMALL AMOUNT LESS THAN THREE

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.746 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION. THAT WOULD GO

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.014 region:rollup2
TOWARDS MEDI CAL IN NINETEEN

00:52:28.746 --> 00:52:31.849 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

00:52:30.014 --> 00:52:34.184 region:rollup2
.

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:35.986 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT A REAL INTUITIVE

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:37.721 region:rollup2
FORMULA THAT PROP FIFTY FIVE

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:39.790 region:rollup2
REFERENCED.

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:41.425 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED.

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.192 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE MEASURE DID IS

00:52:41.425 --> 00:52:42.760 region:rollup2
BASICALLY GIVE THE

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:44.595 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.230 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:48.365 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH FULL DISCRETION TO

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.501 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THAT AS AS. SELF

00:52:48.365 --> 00:52:52.036 region:rollup2
SEAFAIR AT.

00:52:50.501 --> 00:52:54.004 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY MADE A GOOD FAITH

00:52:52.036 --> 00:52:56.206 region:rollup2
EFFORT BUT I THINK I WOULD JUST

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:57.508 region:rollup2
SPEND SOME TIME ON THIS INITIAL

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:58.409 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE WAY THAT THEY'RE

00:52:57.508 --> 00:52:59.777 region:rollup2
DOING THE PROP FIFTY FIVE

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:01.111 region:rollup2
CALCULATION.

00:52:59.777 --> 00:53:01.979 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE KIND OF BE

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:03.714 region:rollup2
A PRECEDENT FOR ALL FUTURE

00:53:01.979 --> 00:53:04.615 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:05.883 region:rollup2
AND WILL OBVIOUSLY BE LOOKING AT

00:53:04.615 --> 00:53:06.517 region:rollup2
THAT IN.

00:53:05.883 --> 00:53:08.986 region:rollup2
TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT ON THOSE

00:53:06.517 --> 00:53:10.287 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS.

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:11.722 region:rollup2
FINALLY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:12.756 region:rollup2
A LOT OF MONEY BY THE GOVERNORS

00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:16.026 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR.

00:53:12.756 --> 00:53:18.062 region:rollup2
REALLY DISCRETIONARY MATTERS.

00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:19.997 region:rollup2
A ONE EXCEPTION IS EDUCATION.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:21.532 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S

00:53:19.997 --> 00:53:22.800 region:rollup2
GROWTH THERE BECAUSE REVENUES

00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:24.134 region:rollup2
ARE HIGHER THERE'S GROWTH IN THE

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.636 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR. THERE'S GROWTH

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:26.470 region:rollup2
OVER THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE

00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:28.272 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR YOU HAD A LOT OF

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.873 region:rollup2
ONE TIME MONIES THAT NOW YOU CAN

00:53:28.272 --> 00:53:31.208 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED THE BUDGET YEAR SO. BY

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:33.644 region:rollup2
OUR CALCULATION YOU HAVE OVER

00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:34.211 region:rollup2
SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROP

00:53:33.644 --> 00:53:35.412 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET THAT TO

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.413 region:rollup2
ALLOCATE.

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:39.016 region:rollup2
FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES K. TWELVE

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:40.451 region:rollup2
INCOMMUNICADO ITS PURPOSE.

00:53:39.016 --> 00:53:42.453 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE K.

00:53:40.451 --> 00:53:43.987 region:rollup2
TWELVE SIDE IS ALLOCATING

00:53:42.453 --> 00:53:46.490 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEIR SHARE IN

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:48.058 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. A

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.627 region:rollup2
APPROVED OF IN THE PAST AND

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:51.628 region:rollup2
THAT'S FULLY FUNDING THE LCF AT.

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:53.464 region:rollup2
AND GIVING A LARGE AMOUNT OF

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:54.965 region:rollup2
BLOCK GRANTS.

00:53:53.464 --> 00:53:56.734 region:rollup2
ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:58.001 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LOT MORE DISCRETIONARY

00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:59.570 region:rollup2
PROPOSES A NEW PROPOSALS THAT MS

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:02.005 region:rollup2
COST DIMENSION.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.707 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA ONLINE PROGRAM

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:05.342 region:rollup2
CTE WE THINK ALL OF THESE

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:08.245 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT WORTH YOUR

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:08.846 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION. THEY'RE NOT EASY

00:54:08.245 --> 00:54:09.780 region:rollup2
THERE'S COMPLICATED ISSUES TO

00:54:08.846 --> 00:54:11.515 region:rollup2
BE.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.850 region:rollup2
DEALT WITH AND I THINK IF YOU

00:54:11.515 --> 00:54:14.485 region:rollup2
WANT TO HAVE

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:16.787 region:rollup2
A RESPONSE TO THESE PROPOSALS

00:54:14.485 --> 00:54:18.422 region:rollup2
AND ENACT THEM IN SOME FORM BY.

00:54:16.787 --> 00:54:20.190 region:rollup2
BY THE BY THE BUDGET IN JUNE YOU

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:20.824 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET GOING EARLY ON THESE

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:22.526 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:23.527 region:rollup2
EASY ISSUES.

00:54:22.526 --> 00:54:26.330 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:54:23.527 --> 00:54:27.765 region:rollup2
ALSO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.265 region:rollup2
I THINK MISS TAYLOR WE GO BACK

00:54:27.765 --> 00:54:30.634 region:rollup2
TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER

00:54:28.265 --> 00:54:31.802 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE.

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:33.971 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A

00:54:31.802 --> 00:54:35.806 region:rollup2
QUESTION POLL FOR THE PARTNER

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.708 region:rollup2
FINANCE AND THE OHIO I'LL START

00:54:35.806 --> 00:54:39.676 region:rollup2
WITH THE MISTRUSTED.

00:54:37.708 --> 00:54:41.645 region:rollup2
THE I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:42.980 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO AYE

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.881 region:rollup2
INCREASE FUNDING FOR THE PSA I

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.315 region:rollup2
THINK A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE

00:54:43.881 --> 00:54:46.650 region:rollup2
DICE ARE BUT IT CERTAINLY

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:48.652 region:rollup2
CATALYZE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:49.219 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. OF

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:51.121 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN THE BSA WOULD BE.

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:53.824 region:rollup2
AND.

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:56.093 region:rollup2
YOU RAISED THE POINT AT THE END

00:54:53.824 --> 00:54:58.362 region:rollup2
OF YOUR PRESENTATION THAT. A ONE

00:54:56.093 --> 00:54:59.396 region:rollup2
YEAR RECESSION IS LIKELY TO COST

00:54:58.362 --> 00:55:00.864 region:rollup2
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:01.832 region:rollup2
REVENUE WHICH THE BSA WOULD

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.966 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT COVER.

00:55:01.832 --> 00:55:04.034 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO IN THE

00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:06.603 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S RECESSION

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:08.405 region:rollup2
SCENARIO YOU PROJECTS THAT IN A

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:09.773 region:rollup2
MILD RECESSION THE TOTAL LOSS OF

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:11.508 region:rollup2
REVENUE WOULD BE ABOUT SEVENTY

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:12.910 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS SO OBVIOUSLY.

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:14.111 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BILLION

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:15.279 region:rollup2
DOLLARS NINETY SA IS NOT EVEN A

00:55:14.111 --> 00:55:17.114 region:rollup2
COME CLOSE TO COVER THAT ONE

00:55:15.279 --> 00:55:17.814 region:rollup2
COVER TWENTY PERCENT SO. I IN

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:19.416 region:rollup2
THE OPINION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:21.018 region:rollup2
FINANCE SHOULD THAT LIMIT BE

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:22.519 region:rollup2
RAISED THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:23.887 region:rollup2
OF TEN PERCENT OF OF STATE

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:25.656 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES IN THE BSA AND IF

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL

00:55:25.656 --> 00:55:29.560 region:rollup2
TO RAISE IT TO.

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:31.028 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I WOULD ALIGN MYSELF

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.696 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE ANALYST

00:55:31.028 --> 00:55:33.630 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT A RESERVE AMOUNT I

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.832 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS ANY

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.266 region:rollup2
MAGIC NUMBER FOR THE RIGHT

00:55:34.832 --> 00:55:37.701 region:rollup2
RESERVE AMOUNT MAKING SOME OF

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:39.002 region:rollup2
THE HOUSE DO YOU. YOU OR HAVE

00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:41.071 region:rollup2
RISK

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:42.239 region:rollup2
A VERSION OR HOW COMFORTABLE YOU

00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.574 region:rollup2
ARE I THINK YOU RAISE A GOOD

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:45.175 region:rollup2
POINT AND WE OBVIOUSLY CAUTION

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:46.843 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN.

00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:48.645 region:rollup2
AS GREAT AS IT IS TO REACH THE

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:50.747 region:rollup2
TARGET APPROVED BY VOTERS THE

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:53.083 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO. IT BUYS YOU

00:55:50.747 --> 00:55:55.185 region:rollup2
TIME IT WON'T ADDRESS PROBABLY

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:57.287 region:rollup2
THE FULL SCOPE OF A RECESSION ON

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:58.589 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.

00:55:57.287 --> 00:56:00.157 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY HISTORICALLY A PUTS

00:55:58.589 --> 00:56:01.191 region:rollup2
US IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION IN

00:56:00.157 --> 00:56:03.093 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS BEEN DURING

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:04.094 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS RECESSIONS.

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.195 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IN THE ELSE'S

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.830 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST I

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.831 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST REMIND FOLKS THERE'S

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.633 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT RESERVE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.901 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS.

00:56:09.633 --> 00:56:12.936 region:rollup2
A ONE IS THE STATE FUND FOR

00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:14.905 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WE DO

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:16.874 region:rollup2
PROPOSE KEEPING MONEY THERE IT'S

00:56:14.905 --> 00:56:18.642 region:rollup2
MORE ON THE LAW ALLOWS IT HAS

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.643 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE LIQUIDITY.

00:56:18.642 --> 00:56:20.978 region:rollup2
VERSES THE BUDGET STABILIZATION

00:56:19.643 --> 00:56:23.013 region:rollup2
ACT

00:56:20.978 --> 00:56:24.548 region:rollup2
SO TO YOUR POINT.

00:56:23.013 --> 00:56:26.550 region:rollup2
I THINK I WOULD LOOK AT BOTH

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:28.151 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS AS BUILDING A TOTAL

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:30.287 region:rollup2
RESERVE AMOUNT WITH REALLY

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:31.755 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE A LOVER'S AVAILABLE

00:56:30.287 --> 00:56:33.357 region:rollup2
SHOULD SOMETHING HAPPEN WON WITH

00:56:31.755 --> 00:56:34.391 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE LIQUIDITY ANOTHER

00:56:33.357 --> 00:56:36.193 region:rollup2
WHICH WOULD PROBABLY INVOLVED

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.461 region:rollup2
MORE THOUGHTFUL LONGTERM PROCESS

00:56:36.193 --> 00:56:38.695 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:56:37.461 --> 00:56:40.864 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:43.033 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION ACT.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:43.967 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AYE MR TAYLOR A.

00:56:43.033 --> 00:56:44.735 region:rollup2
I'D WANT TALK ABOUT STATE

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:47.504 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES.

00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:48.538 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.706 region:rollup2
A OBVIOUSLY IT'S EASY FOR

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:51.141 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO DO A VICTORY LAP

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:52.910 region:rollup2
OVER YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:54.077 region:rollup2
REVENUES ARE UP SO MUCH BUT. I

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.779 region:rollup2
ALSO THINK THAT SOMETIMES THAT

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:56.880 region:rollup2
CALLS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.848 region:rollup2
DEGREE TO WHICH STATE

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.416 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN GROWING

00:56:57.848 --> 00:57:00.450 region:rollup2
AND IN MY OPINION THEY'VE BEEN

00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:02.286 region:rollup2
GROWING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.553 region:rollup2
AT AN ALARMING RATE. IN FACT

00:57:02.286 --> 00:57:04.488 region:rollup2
ALMOST THREE TIMES THE RATE OF

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:06.223 region:rollup2
INFLATION

00:57:04.488 --> 00:57:07.691 region:rollup2
SO I THOUGHT IS THAT LEVEL OF

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:10.527 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE GROWTH SUSTAINABLE

00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:12.362 region:rollup2
LONG TERM IN YOUR OPINION.

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:13.697 region:rollup2
BUT I.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.032 region:rollup2
IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHY THEY'RE

00:57:13.697 --> 00:57:16.767 region:rollup2
GROWING AS THE DAY ARE THEY

00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:18.368 region:rollup2
ONGOING OUR DAY YOU TALK ABOUT

00:57:16.767 --> 00:57:19.836 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND OR JUST GENERAL

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:21.772 region:rollup2
FUND AND SPECIAL FUN.

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.839 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT EXACTLY

00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:24.007 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER THAT YOU'RE REFERRING

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:25.609 region:rollup2
TO I HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:26.943 region:rollup2
AT THE ACTUAL NUMBERS.

00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:28.612 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK HOLISTICALLY I MEAN

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:29.279 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF

00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:30.580 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THINGS.

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:31.648 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS OF THE MINIMUM WAGE

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:33.684 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT CHRISTIAN STATE

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:34.551 region:rollup2
SALARIES OF THE PENSION FUND

00:57:33.684 --> 00:57:35.886 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:37.220 region:rollup2
INTO THE CREASE CONTRIBUTION

00:57:35.886 --> 00:57:39.122 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE BALL THOSE PUT

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.623 region:rollup2
TOGETHER PAINT WHAT I CONSIDER

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.158 region:rollup2
TO BE IN A VERY ALARMING

00:57:39.623 --> 00:57:42.693 region:rollup2
PICTURE.

00:57:41.158 --> 00:57:43.360 region:rollup2
I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER

00:57:42.693 --> 00:57:44.861 region:rollup2
SIDE THAT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO

00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:46.063 region:rollup2
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TO NOT ONLY

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:47.931 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED STE WHAT IS YOUR

00:57:46.063 --> 00:57:48.865 region:rollup2
LONG TERM REVENUE STREAM ONCE

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:50.167 region:rollup2
YOU TRY TO SMOOTH OUT THE

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:51.068 region:rollup2
EFFECTS.

00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:52.402 region:rollup2
OF CAPITAL GAINS ANOTHER ONE

00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:54.371 region:rollup2
TIME THINGS

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:55.472 region:rollup2
AND YOUR EXPENDITURES STRAINING

00:57:54.371 --> 00:57:56.239 region:rollup2
AND CAN YOU BRING THOSE THOSE

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:58.508 region:rollup2
LINES NEED TO BE BROUGHT

00:57:56.239 --> 00:58:00.477 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. AYE YOU'RE SUGGESTING

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:01.845 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE THEY'RE NOT OR THAT

00:58:00.477 --> 00:58:03.046 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BRING DOWN ONE AS

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:04.748 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW MAKING

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.983 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS ON RESERVES TO

00:58:04.748 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THE FLUCTUATIONS IN

00:58:05.983 --> 00:58:08.318 region:rollup2
THE OTHER. I KNOW I WOULD

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:10.220 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY AGREE WITH YOU HAVE TO

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:11.988 region:rollup2
LOOK AT BOTH SIDES. AND YOU WANT

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:14.825 region:rollup2
TO BRING THEM IN BALANCE.

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT THANK YOU.

00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:20.731 region:rollup2
MISS MEDINA.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:22.966 region:rollup2
I I HEARD AND SAW A LOT OF US.

00:58:20.731 --> 00:58:24.668 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS PLAN FOR EDUCATION

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:28.038 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO K.

00:58:24.668 --> 00:58:29.873 region:rollup2
TWELVE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

00:58:28.038 --> 00:58:31.942 region:rollup2
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR OR SEE MUCH ON

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:32.142 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:58:31.942 --> 00:58:34.711 region:rollup2
AND.

00:58:32.142 --> 00:58:36.980 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BOTH

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:38.882 region:rollup2
THE UC REGENTS AND THE CSU

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:41.218 region:rollup2
TRUSTEES WILL BE CONSIDERING

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:43.153 region:rollup2
TUITION HIKES.

00:58:41.218 --> 00:58:44.221 region:rollup2
AND IT STRIKES ME THAT WE ARE

00:58:43.153 --> 00:58:45.822 region:rollup2
GONNA BE ASKING CALIFORNIA

00:58:44.221 --> 00:58:48.458 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:50.861 region:rollup2
IN BOTH THE CSU AND THE UC TO

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:52.763 region:rollup2
PAY HIGHER TUITION.

00:58:50.861 --> 00:58:54.664 region:rollup2
AT A TIME WHERE AS YOU JUST

00:58:52.763 --> 00:58:56.333 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO US CALIFORNIA IS

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.667 region:rollup2
DOING THE BEST.

00:58:56.333 --> 00:58:59.469 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY.

00:58:57.667 --> 00:59:01.505 region:rollup2
AS YOU STATED.

00:58:59.469 --> 00:59:04.541 region:rollup2
RETAILER IN YOUR LIFETIME.

00:59:01.505 --> 00:59:07.077 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A BIG IRONY TO ME.

00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:08.779 region:rollup2
ARE IT IS MY UNDERSTOOD AND.

00:59:07.077 --> 00:59:09.546 region:rollup2
I WILL ASK HOW DO YOU RESPOND AS

00:59:08.779 --> 00:59:11.381 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION

00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:12.582 region:rollup2
SPOT.

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:14.584 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:16.053 region:rollup2
THINK ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:18.555 region:rollup2
A A IN THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE

00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:19.756 region:rollup2
REVENUES ARE THAT MANY OF THEM

00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:21.091 region:rollup2
ARE ONE TIME THE NATURE SOME OF

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.125 region:rollup2
THE GAINS WERE SAYING ON THE

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:23.093 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INCOME TAX.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:24.995 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXTREMELY VOLATILE

00:59:23.093 --> 00:59:26.496 region:rollup2
REVENUE SOURCE

00:59:24.995 --> 00:59:27.898 region:rollup2
IN THE MAY REVISION IN OUR

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:29.399 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION CHAPTER WE

00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:30.901 region:rollup2
SIGNAL TO BOTH THE ISSUE AND YOU

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:32.869 region:rollup2
SEE THAT THEY CAN ANTICIPATED

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:33.970 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT INCREASE WHICH IS

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:35.806 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THE

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:37.641 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET.

00:59:35.806 --> 00:59:39.009 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR ALSO INDICATED BOTH

00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:40.644 region:rollup2
IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AS WELL

00:59:39.009 --> 00:59:42.112 region:rollup2
AS IN OUR PUBLICATION THAT

00:59:40.644 --> 00:59:44.381 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH TUITION

00:59:42.112 --> 00:59:45.615 region:rollup2
INCREASES WE STILL ARE HOPING

00:59:44.381 --> 00:59:47.417 region:rollup2
THAT BOTH THE ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:48.718 region:rollup2
WILL REDUCE THEIR OVERALL COST

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.853 region:rollup2
STRUCTURES IN THIS TO NOT SADDLE

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:51.354 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WITH

00:59:49.853 --> 00:59:53.990 region:rollup2
INCREASED TUITION COSTS.

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:54.791 region:rollup2
AND WE CONTINUE TO.

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:57.027 region:rollup2
WHAT TO SEE THAT WITH BOTH

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:59.095 region:rollup2
SEGMENTS?

00:59:57.027 --> 01:00:00.630 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW UP.

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.965 region:rollup2
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.967 region:rollup2
THERE HAD BEEN AN AGREEMENT

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.268 region:rollup2
REACHED BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.803 region:rollup2
YOU SEE FOR FOUR PERCENT ANNUAL

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:08.305 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:10.073 region:rollup2
BUT THIS YEAR WE'RE ONLY LOOKING

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:12.075 region:rollup2
AT A THREE PERCENT INCREASE TO

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:13.210 region:rollup2
THE UC BUT.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.578 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE A PREVIOUS BUDGET

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.779 region:rollup2
YOURS IN THE CURRENT BUDGET YEAR

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:17.414 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE FOUR PERCENT I BELIEVE

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.682 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR BEFORE THAT

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:19.983 region:rollup2
THEY HAD FOUR PERCENT BUT I

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:21.251 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:23.687 region:rollup2
SEVEN OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:24.788 region:rollup2
CHAPTER. OF NAY REVISION WE KNOW

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:26.890 region:rollup2
TO THREE PERCENT INCREASE FOR

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:28.558 region:rollup2
BOTH SEGMENTS SO WHEN YOU SEE

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:29.493 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT AND ENROLLMENT

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:30.494 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:31.928 region:rollup2
AND NOT KEEPING.

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:33.597 region:rollup2
.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:35.165 region:rollup2
AND NOT RAISING TUITION FOUR

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:36.266 region:rollup2
PERCENT WAS NEVER THE FIGURE

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:38.535 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:39.769 region:rollup2
AGREED UPON.

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.904 region:rollup2
IN PREVIOUS BUDGET YEARS THAT

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.905 region:rollup2
WAS THE FIGURE THAT WAS AGREED

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:43.073 region:rollup2
TO AND NOT IN THE CAR AND NOT

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:46.343 region:rollup2
BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:47.177 region:rollup2
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:51.381 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:53.950 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO BETTER.

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:55.352 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANTED.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.952 region:rollup2
CLARIFY ONE THING AROUND

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:58.722 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH SOON ROMAN

01:00:55.952 --> 01:01:00.123 region:rollup2

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:23.273 region:rollup2
AND.

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:25.642 region:rollup2
.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:27.143 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO ASK WHAT WHAT IS

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:29.713 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S.

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:33.550 region:rollup2
OFFICES POSITION IN TERMS OF.

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:34.884 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.952 region:rollup2
IF IF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:38.255 region:rollup2
PROJECTING DEFICITS IN THESE CUT

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:41.758 region:rollup2
BUDGET TIMES.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:43.059 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:47.998 region:rollup2
WHEN THE END OF UP ALREADY

01:02:43.059 --> 01:02:49.199 region:rollup2
RECESSION DOES HIT.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:50.267 region:rollup2
AS THE ALLIES POINTED OUT I

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:51.635 region:rollup2
THINK MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.736 region:rollup2
HEARING AS WE ARE AS WELL FROM

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:53.937 region:rollup2
BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:56.172 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARDS ABOUT THEIR

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:57.674 region:rollup2
PENSION COST.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
I THINK MY RESPONSE WOULD BE TO

01:02:57.674 --> 01:03:00.644 region:rollup2
THINK OF EDUCATION PREVIOUSLY

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.278 region:rollup2
VERSES NOW IN THE OLD

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:03.747 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL WORLD IT WOULD BE

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:05.282 region:rollup2
EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:06.483 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:08.451 region:rollup2
THESE COST THROUGH THE LOCAL

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:09.552 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:11.121 region:rollup2
AS CONSOLIDATING MOST

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.422 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:14.324 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE MUCH MORE

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:15.759 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THESE ON

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:17.027 region:rollup2
GOING COST

01:03:15.759 --> 01:03:18.628 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE SCHOOL

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:20.764 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS USING THIS NEW

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:22.098 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY AND THIS MASSIVE

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:23.166 region:rollup2

DEMANDS AND MAKE DECISIONS

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:31.374 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY WITH THEIR LOCAL

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:33.276 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:35.245 region:rollup2

IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:10.153 region:rollup2
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR.

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:11.321 region:rollup2
CONGESTED CORRIDOR PROGRAMS

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
THIS FUNDING AVAILABLE OTHER

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:14.457 region:rollup2
SNOW TUNER MILLION DOLLARS YEAR

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.692 region:rollup2
FOR CONGESTED CORRIDORS. THERE'S

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:17.226 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:20.029 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR COMMUTER CORRIDORS.

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:21.030 region:rollup2
YET THIS MONEY ALONG WITH THE

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.565 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT'S GONNA BE

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:24.100 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR ON THE

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:25.368 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION PROJECTS.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.570 region:rollup2
AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND AND THEN

01:08:25.368 --> 01:08:28.104 region:rollup2
SHIFT MORE TOWARDS THE THE

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.072 region:rollup2
PROJECTS PROJECTS ARE MORE

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.340 region:rollup2
READY.

01:08:29.072 --> 01:08:31.741 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY THEN WE'LL LOOK AT

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:33.543 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT HAVE.

01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:35.211 region:rollup2
THAT THE CALL BENEFITS OF SOME

01:08:33.543 --> 01:08:36.346 region:rollup2
CAPACITY INCREASE

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.880 region:rollup2
THAT COME ALONG WITH THE

01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:38.948 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION JUST SO I

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.683 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND AND MAYBE CAN CLARIFY

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:42.018 region:rollup2
THIS FOR ME MYERS AND THAT IS

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.753 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONGESTED CORRIDORS

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:45.188 region:rollup2
FINDING THERE'S A PROHIBITION TO

01:08:43.753 --> 01:08:46.990 region:rollup2
USE ANY OF THOSE FUNDS FOR

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:47.890 region:rollup2
GENERAL PURPOSE LANES.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:48.958 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.593 region:rollup2
I DON'T LIKE THE THE.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:52.128 region:rollup2
.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.962 region:rollup2
THE GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THOSE

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:54.931 region:rollup2
OF THOSE FUNDS ARE ARE STILL

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.299 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED.

01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:58.468 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ISN'T ALWAYS I MEAN

01:08:56.299 --> 01:09:00.470 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU CAN ACHIEVE

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.771 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NOT

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:03.339 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BY ALWAYS ADDING TO

01:09:01.771 --> 01:09:03.973 region:rollup2
SHOW MIGHT SOMETIMES IT'S IT'S

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.907 region:rollup2
COORDINATING THE LANE SOMETIMES

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.042 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:08.077 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COORDINATING THE FLOW

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.911 region:rollup2
OF TRAFFIC SO THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.013 region:rollup2
THAT GOES INTO JUNE BIT TO AND

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.014 region:rollup2
BEEN.

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:12.982 region:rollup2
JUST ADDING ADDITIONAL POINTS

01:09:11.014 --> 01:09:14.784 region:rollup2
NOW ALL THE PROJECTS ARE PROVED

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:16.853 region:rollup2
TO SEE TC'S PROCESS SO THERE

01:09:14.784 --> 01:09:18.821 region:rollup2
WILL BE. GUIDELINES FOR WITH.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:20.223 region:rollup2
IT WHAT MAKES THE PROJECTS WHAT

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:21.591 region:rollup2
WHAT PROJECTS ARE THE MOST

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:23.226 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGEOUS AND THEY'LL HAVE

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:25.461 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO

01:09:23.226 --> 01:09:27.130 region:rollup2
MEASURE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:29.766 region:rollup2
BURKE CHEATING THOSE RESULTS SO.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:31.768 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REDUCING CONGESTION IS

01:09:29.766 --> 01:09:32.802 region:rollup2
IS THE MAIN YOU KNOW THE MAIN

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.003 region:rollup2
RESULT THAT'S.

01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:35.905 region:rollup2
BEING LOOKED FOR OUT OF THOSE

01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.707 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR FUNDS OKAY THANK YOU

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:39.175 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH AND ANSWERS OF. LOVE

01:09:37.707 --> 01:09:40.843 region:rollup2
MOVING TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:45.181 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:51.554 region:rollup2
TO. ALLOCATE SOME FUNDING TO.

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:52.388 region:rollup2
MORE SURFACE WATER STORAGE.

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:54.057 region:rollup2
I HAVE MY STAFF THAT APPEAR

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:56.159 region:rollup2
PROVIDES MORE SPECIFICS BUT AS I

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:58.327 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED EARLIER WE DO HAVE A

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:59.896 region:rollup2
POSTAL TWO. CAN A FOR LACK OF A

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:01.831 region:rollup2
BETTER TERM PRE APPROPRIATE SOME

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:04.367 region:rollup2
OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BONDS

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:06.302 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:08.538 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THAT OBVIOUSLY IS FOR

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:10.039 region:rollup2
OUR WATER AND THAT'LL UNISOM.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:12.075 region:rollup2
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:14.644 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:15.845 region:rollup2
ONE SHE'S ME MATT ARMY

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.779 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:17.947 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO THE VOTERS

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:20.049 region:rollup2
APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE WHICH

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:23.186 region:rollup2
WAS A WATER BOND IN WITH IN THAT

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:24.387 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE OF BOND INCLUDED

01:10:23.186 --> 01:10:25.922 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE WAS ABOUT THREE

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.590 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS OF.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:29.625 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:31.627 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SURFACE STORAGE THAT

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:33.730 region:rollup2
WAS CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IN

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:35.731 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.333 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE JUST RECENTLY ADOPTED

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:39.068 region:rollup2
ITS GUIDELINES.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:39.735 region:rollup2
TO GOVERN THE USE OF THAT AND

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.471 region:rollup2
SO.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:42.805 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING OF THAT THE

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:44.707 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROCESSES THAT YOU GET

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:47.276 region:rollup2
YOURS GOING THROUGH THE. PROCESS

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:49.579 region:rollup2
OF EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:51.247 region:rollup2
THAT OKAY WELL JUST ECHO TO AN

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.814 region:rollup2
ANALYST IS SAYING I THINK WE DO.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.149 region:rollup2
WANT TO FOCUS MORE LONG TERM

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:55.518 region:rollup2
AND.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:58.020 region:rollup2
THE CONCERN I THINK FOR THE A

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:58.921 region:rollup2
LOT OF THOSE FUNDS IS THAT.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:00.189 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING FOR HIM.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:02.258 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROJECTS BUT NOT ONES

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.760 region:rollup2
THAT OF SUBSTANTIAL SIZE TO

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.495 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN WITH IT WHETHER.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.497 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LARGE DROUGHT AS

01:11:05.495 --> 01:11:08.664 region:rollup2
WE'VE EXPERIENCE HISTORICALLY SO

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:10.099 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LIKE PROJECTS LIKE

01:11:08.664 --> 01:11:11.601 region:rollup2
SITES ARE TEMPERANCE.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:13.136 region:rollup2
WHERE IT WILL HAVE SOME

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.637 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS OF THE SAKE

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:16.105 region:rollup2
OF WHERE THEY ARE SIZABLE

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:17.306 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS AND SO I DON'T KNOW

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.040 region:rollup2
IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:20.243 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:22.245 region:rollup2
IN INVESTING SOME OF THE.

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:24.514 region:rollup2
BUT MAKING AN INVESTMENT FROM

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:27.116 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET IN TERMS OF DOING

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:28.618 region:rollup2
LARGE SCALE WATER STORAGE.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:31.020 region:rollup2
A LIKE I SAID I THINK THE.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:32.622 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE SIZEABLE INVESTMENT

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:36.025 region:rollup2
OF PROPOSITION ONE.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:37.527 region:rollup2
THAT DOES REFLECT A IN THAT WAS

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:39.262 region:rollup2
PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:41.097 region:rollup2
WATER ACTION PLAN.

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:42.231 region:rollup2
I SHOULD SAY TOO SO THE

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.599 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THROUGH ITS WATER

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:45.034 region:rollup2
ACTION PLAN IN SUPPORT OF

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:46.335 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION ONE HAS.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:48.304 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT FOR

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:50.439 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL STORAGE CAPACITY

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:51.507 region:rollup2
COMBINED WITH WATER CONSERVATION

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.109 region:rollup2
COMBINED WITH BETTER GROUND

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:54.010 region:rollup2
WATER MANAGEMENT KIND OF.

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:56.512 region:rollup2
.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:58.347 region:rollup2
.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:12:00.917 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE.

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:02.485 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO WATER AND IF I MAY

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:04.587 region:rollup2
THEM OFF OF THE ANALYST COMMENT

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:06.022 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE. SHE'S CAUTIONED I

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.956 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A BENEFIT ONE OF THE

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:08.558 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF REACHING THE

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:10.626 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL TARGET OF

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:12.428 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO IS THAT IN

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.896 region:rollup2
FUTURE YEARS ANY DOLLARS THAT

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:16.032 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:17.400 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACT OR

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:18.901 region:rollup2
UTILIZED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.503 region:rollup2
SO THEORETICALLY IF THE ENACTED

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:22.905 region:rollup2
BUDGET REACHES THAT TEN PERCENT

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:25.007 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL. A HOT TARGET YOU

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:26.075 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.777 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:29.345 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.513 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AND LASTLY JUST IN FUN

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.914 region:rollup2
FORCE MANAGEMENT.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:33.516 region:rollup2
OUT OF SOMEONE ELSE IS GONNA

01:12:31.914 --> 01:12:36.552 region:rollup2
RUN APPEAR AND ANSWER SOME

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:37.687 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS SO I APOLOGIZE LIKE. I

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:39.422 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THE BUDGET HAS FOCUSED

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.923 region:rollup2
A LOT ON FIRE PROTECTION BUT IN

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:42.959 region:rollup2
TERMS OF PREVENTION.

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:43.793 region:rollup2
AND AND HEALTHY FORESTS.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:46.863 region:rollup2
.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:48.264 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH IS ALLOCATED TOWARD?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:50.399 region:rollup2
THE FORCE MANAGEMENT AND HOW

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:52.802 region:rollup2
MUCH IS.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:53.970 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO ACTUALLY PREVENT A LOT

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:55.938 region:rollup2
OF THESE HOW CATASTROPHIC

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.739 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES ARE VERY.

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.507 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY MADE A PRETTY

01:12:56.739 --> 01:13:00.109 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN FORCE

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:01.344 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE CAP AND

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:02.912 region:rollup2
TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN IN THE

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:04.747 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:05.481 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. WE STOP THE

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:07.950 region:rollup2
STATE RESPONSE THAT

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:08.985 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AREA FEE AND HAVE

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.586 region:rollup2
FACT FILLED ALL OF THOSE

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.921 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE FIRE

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:13.823 region:rollup2
SAFE COUNCILS VEGETATION

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:14.690 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION AND

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:16.425 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:17.860 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WITH A VERY HEALTHY

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.662 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE PERIOD FOR FOREST

MANAGEMENT.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:23.032 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:24.667 region:rollup2
SO TRADITIONALLY HOME OR

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:27.136 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD HAD TREE

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:28.137 region:rollup2
MORTALITY DOLLAR SPECIFICALLY IN

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:29.305 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN THE

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:31.641 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR IT'S ACTUALLY THE

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:33.075 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:34.010 region:rollup2
WITH JUST LAST QUESTION I I

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.545 region:rollup2
THINK HE WAS CHAIR.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:37.013 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LIKE TREE MORTALITY

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:39.115 region:rollup2
AND.

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:41.150 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF THESE

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:42.585 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS ARE ARE WORSENING AND I

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:43.552 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE FIRES ARE GOING

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.554 region:rollup2
LARGER.

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:47.423 region:rollup2
IN SO WE OUT SEE CLEARLY NEED

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:49.992 region:rollup2
TO DO A LOT MORE IN FORCE

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:51.127 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND AND AND.

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.828 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT IS TWO HUNDRED

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:54.163 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS ENOUGH I GUESS

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:55.564 region:rollup2
IS THE QUESTION IS THERE AN

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:57.500 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS FROM CAL FIRE.

01:13:55.564 --> 01:13:59.302 region:rollup2
FROM ANY OTHER ANALYSTS ARE

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.970 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT THAT.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.837 region:rollup2
GIVES US A SENSE OF IS THERE A

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:03.806 region:rollup2
GAP THAT WE NEED TO.

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:05.041 region:rollup2
TO MEET

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:06.409 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THAT THIS THIS

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.576 region:rollup2
GROWING PROBLEM. I WOULD POINT

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:08.978 region:rollup2
TO SOME OTHER ALLOCATION

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:11.113 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE OUTSIDE OF

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:13.549 region:rollup2
THE CAP AND TRADE A THINK WE TRY

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.617 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.352 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT WE CALL THE NEW NORMAL

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.654 region:rollup2
WITH CALIFORNIA ARE. THEY REALLY

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:20.456 region:rollup2
ARE MOVING TO REALLY A TWELVE

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:21.891 region:rollup2
MONTH FIRE SEASON SO WE TRY TO

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:23.259 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATE THEIR SOCKS STOPPING

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:24.627 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL.

01:14:23.259 --> 01:14:26.896 region:rollup2
DISSING WE HAVE SOME PROPOSALS

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.630 region:rollup2
TO BRING HELICOPTERS AND UPDATE

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:30.266 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:32.601 region:rollup2
NEEDED HAD TO FIGHT FOREST FIRES

01:14:30.266 --> 01:14:33.602 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS PREVENT THEM. SO I

01:14:32.601 --> 01:14:35.137 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE MADE SOME PRETTY

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:37.873 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THIS

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:41.377 region:rollup2
AREA AND WE'RE CONTINUING THOSE

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:44.513 region:rollup2
IN OUR PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU.

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:47.049 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'VE BEEN MUCH.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:48.818 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ARE MISSING OUT.

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:50.720 region:rollup2
THINK YOU AT A COUPLE COMMENTS

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:53.956 region:rollup2

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.591 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION SIDE AND I WANT TO

ECHO THE VOICES OF THE.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:59.762 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:01.097 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

01:14:59.762 --> 01:15:02.998 region:rollup2
AND THEIR FEELINGS AND

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:05.267 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON THE BUDGET IS NOT

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:06.802 region:rollup2
A LYING TO AND THIS YOU KNOW THE

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:08.304 region:rollup2
CAPITAL STATE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:09.638 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:11.374 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR LOUD AND

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:13.142 region:rollup2
CLEAR SO. I HOPE THAT THOSE

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:14.176 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WILL BE I WILL

01:15:13.142 --> 01:15:17.413 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:18.781 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AIDS TO VERY DIFFERENT

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:20.383 region:rollup2
FEELINGS ON IT OUTLOOKS

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:21.751 region:rollup2
ON AND THE BUDGET. AND

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:23.352 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY I I WANT TO.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.854 region:rollup2
.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.021 region:rollup2
I COMMEND THE CONSIDERATION FOR

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:27.490 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE REDESIGN OF

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:29.759 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDING I KNOW

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:31.727 region:rollup2
THAT THE LA ALSO DID A REPORT

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:33.996 region:rollup2
RECENTLY THAT LOOKED. ON A

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:35.564 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE AT WHAT CATEGORY

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:37.199 region:rollup2
CLOSE LOOK LIKE WHO THE SERVE

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:38.701 region:rollup2
WITH THE DON'T SERVE. AND AND SO

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.136 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE AND SEEMS A

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.570 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT CAME OUT OF

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:42.538 region:rollup2
THAT REPORT IN THERE. AND I

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.807 region:rollup2
THINK IS.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:44.974 region:rollup2
INTERESTING AND I DO HOPE THAT

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:46.776 region:rollup2
IN.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:48.577 region:rollup2
BUDGETS UP TO WILL CONTINUE TO

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:50.613 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT.

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:52.047 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PIECE

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:53.482 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO HOPE THAT IN BUDGETS

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:55.317 region:rollup2
OF TO AND IN HIGHER ED.

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:56.952 region:rollup2
WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE ONLINE

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:57.787 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE I'M TO

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.789 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:01.857 region:rollup2
REALLY IF THAT'S THE VEHICLE TO

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:03.292 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE NOT ONLY DEGREES BUT

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:04.260 region:rollup2
DEGREES FOR THOSE THAT ARE MOST

01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:06.595 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:08.364 region:rollup2
AT PARTICULARLY IN DESERT AREAS

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:10.132 region:rollup2
OF HIGHER AD SO I DO HOPE THAT

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:11.467 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO COMMITTEES I WILL

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:13.502 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION.

01:16:11.467 --> 01:16:16.105 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE STATE

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:19.475 region:rollup2
FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:21.777 region:rollup2
YEAH WE JUST I HEARD AT. THAT.

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:23.979 region:rollup2
YOU DESCRIBE IT HELLFIRE IS NO

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:24.513 region:rollup2
LONGER PAPA GOING TO BE LOOKED

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.215 region:rollup2
AT HAS A SEASONAL BUT YEAR

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.950 region:rollup2
ROUND.

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:29.785 region:rollup2
OUR GOVERNOR ON DECEMBER

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.020 region:rollup2
NINETEENTH WAS IN THE THOMAS

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.688 region:rollup2
FIRE AREA.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.056 region:rollup2
WHICH I REPRESENT.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:36.492 region:rollup2
AND TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING THE

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:38.594 region:rollup2
NEW NORMAL SO MY QUESTION IS IF

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:40.262 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL DO WE USE

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:42.465 region:rollup2
THE STATE FUND FOR ECONOMIC

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:42.665 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY WHICH IS ONE OF THE

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:43.632 region:rollup2
CHIU.

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:45.668 region:rollup2
.

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:46.902 region:rollup2
BUDGET AREAS YOU DESCRIBED AS

01:16:45.668 --> 01:16:49.939 region:rollup2
RESERVES.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:51.974 region:rollup2
TO BE USED FOR EMERGENCY AS THE

01:16:49.939 --> 01:16:54.076 region:rollup2
VEHICLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THIS

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:55.678 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL DO WE

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:57.480 region:rollup2
NEED TO BREAK CONSIDER.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:58.781 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT THAT THE NEW NORMAL

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.349 region:rollup2
HAS

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:02.251 region:rollup2
I'M ON THE BUDGET AND TO REALLY

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.452 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF A RESERVE

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:04.553 region:rollup2
OR IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:06.388 region:rollup2
RETHINK.

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:09.458 region:rollup2
HOW THE STATE IS GOING TO

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:12.428 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO NATURAL DISASTERS AT

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.262 region:rollup2
A MUCH BROADER LEVEL?

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I THINK WE'VE

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:16.365 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED TO DO BOTH.

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:19.201 region:rollup2
I THINK WE TRY TO ADJUST THE

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:20.469 region:rollup2
STOCKING LEVELS AT CAL FIRE. OH

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.704 region:rollup2
YES AND SOME OF OUR OTHER FIRST

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.172 region:rollup2
RESPONDERS.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:24.507 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD FOR US TO PROTECT

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.508 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

01:17:24.507 --> 01:17:27.309 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU IN THE BUDGETS

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.043 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED AND

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:30.679 region:rollup2
WE'VE TRIED DROUGHT WE'VE HAD

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:33.549 region:rollup2
FLOODING HOW FIRES MUDSLIDES SO

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:35.050 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY. SEEMS TO BE MORE

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:36.819 region:rollup2
THE CASE THE NOTS.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.154 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONALLY HAD SOMETHING

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2
THE COMPOUNDS ARE EMERGENCY

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:42.057 region:rollup2
RESPONSES THAT LIKELY MUCH OF

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:43.826 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE REIMBURSED BY THE

01:17:42.057 --> 01:17:47.730 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS A

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:48.264 region:rollup2
LONGER. TERM PROCESS THAT WE GO

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:50.299 region:rollup2
THROUGH WITH THE FEDERAL

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:52.101 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SO IN SOME WAYS THE

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:53.802 region:rollup2
AS AT THE U. IS IS KIND OF

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:55.604 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY PLACED ACTUALLY TO

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:57.573 region:rollup2
HELP US WITH THE SHORT INFUSIONS

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:58.874 region:rollup2
OF CASH TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE A

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:01.877 region:rollup2
MERCHANT THE RESPONSE.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:03.679 region:rollup2
IS QUICK IS TIMELY WELL AS WELL

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:05.414 region:rollup2
AS RECOVERY FRANKLY THROUGH THE

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:07.182 region:rollup2
JAIL BC PROCESS WE'VE NOTIFIED

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.984 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE OF THINGS SUCH

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.952 region:rollup2
AS HAZARDOUS WASTE REMOVAL

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:11.820 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN RIGHT

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:13.422 region:rollup2
AWAY BEFORE THESE COMMUNITIES

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.657 region:rollup2
CAN REALLY BEGIN TO REBUILD.

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:15.958 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S A TWO FOLD

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:17.293 region:rollup2
APPROACH LOOKING AT OUR OVERALL

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:19.562 region:rollup2
STAFFING LEVELS.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:20.796 region:rollup2
BASED ON HISTORIC TRENDS WHICH

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:23.332 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE CHANGING AS WE CALL

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:24.667 region:rollup2
THE NEW NORMAL. AS WELL AS AND

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:27.136 region:rollup2
UTILIZING OUR.

01:18:24.667 --> 01:18:28.837 region:rollup2
SFE YOU FOR THE THINGS THAT

01:18:27.136 --> 01:18:30.506 region:rollup2
INVARIABLY WILL HAPPEN.

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:32.107 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS YOU KNOW

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:34.243 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A HORRIBLE HEPATITIS

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:36.212 region:rollup2
OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO WE ALSO

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:38.681 region:rollup2
SEND SOME FUNDING THERE TO HELP

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:40.849 region:rollup2
WITH THAT. SO THERE IS.

01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:42.518 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET IS A FLUID PROCESS

01:18:40.849 --> 01:18:44.553 region:rollup2
HOME OBVIOUSLY WE PASSED IT IN

01:18:42.518 --> 01:18:46.255 region:rollup2
JUNE BUT THINGS HAPPEN

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.756 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES PUBLIC HEALTH. ON

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:49.458 region:rollup2
NATURAL DISASTERS HAPPEN IN THE

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:53.262 region:rollup2
US AT THE U. HELPS US ADDRESS

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:54.763 region:rollup2
THOSE IN A REAL TIME MANNER.

01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:57.132 region:rollup2
A I WOULD JUST ADD TO.

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:58.701 region:rollup2
TO MISS COST IS A DISCUSSION

01:18:57.132 --> 01:19:00.469 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS

01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:02.037 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO TO ADDRESS KIND OF

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.305 region:rollup2
THIS NEW NORMAL FROM A BUDGETARY

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:05.407 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT.

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:07.509 region:rollup2
IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:09.578 region:rollup2
BUDGET HAS AN ITEM IN AND

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:11.247 region:rollup2
CALLED THE EMERGENCY FUND THE

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.949 region:rollup2
FUND IT'S KIND OF A SHORTHAND.

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:16.752 region:rollup2
AND IT REFLECTS

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:17.653 region:rollup2
WHAT THE A FIVE YEAR AVERAGE OF

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.988 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY.

01:19:17.653 --> 01:19:20.456 region:rollup2
WHILE FIRE SUPPRESSION COSTS

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:22.925 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:24.426 region:rollup2
IN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AFTER A

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:26.028 region:rollup2
SEVERE DROUGHT OF HISTORIC

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.529 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONS.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:29.265 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT THAT.

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:31.700 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION IS BUDGETING

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:32.735 region:rollup2
IN THE FUND HAS GROWN A PRETTY

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.104 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:37.273 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS SO THE BUDGET NOT

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:39.441 region:rollup2
ONLY HAS THE.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:42.011 region:rollup2
SIZEABLE RESERVE TO ADDRESS

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.879 region:rollup2
THESE UNCERTAINTIES BUT IS ALSO

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:46.248 region:rollup2
A BUDGETING WITHIN THIS

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:47.750 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY FUND ITEM. A HIGHER

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:49.918 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO REFLECT THIS.

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.654 region:rollup2
THIS NORM.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
AND SO FOR THAT ESSAY FOR YOU

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:55.391 region:rollup2
FUNDS IT DO YOU FEEL THAT I MEAN

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.393 region:rollup2
JUST IN THE SAME WAY WE ARE

01:19:55.391 --> 01:19:58.527 region:rollup2
RECONSIDERING. AND THE BSA

01:19:57.393 --> 01:20:00.763 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT AND WHETHER THAT

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:02.998 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE MORE THANTHE ALLOTTED.

01:20:00.763 --> 01:20:04.967 region:rollup2
IS THERE VALUE TO RECONSIDER

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:08.037 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL FOR THE AND SAFE

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:09.104 region:rollup2
SFE YOU FUNDS.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:11.006 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE ANOTHER ITEM THAT

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:12.141 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK AT ME REVISE AYE IT'S

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:14.376 region:rollup2
LARGELY DRIVEN BY OVERALL

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:15.944 region:rollup2
REVENUES WHAT WE KNOW OUR

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:17.212 region:rollup2
EXISTING ON GOING COSTS ARE

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:19.648 region:rollup2
INCLUDING IN THE GUARANTEE WHAT

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:21.817 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TWO REQUIRES AND SO

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:23.052 region:rollup2
AS WE REEVALUATE REVENUES GOING

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:23.819 region:rollup2
INTO MAY REVISE WILL LOOK ASSET

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:26.922 region:rollup2
TO YOU AS. WELL.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:30.726 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:31.960 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISS CABALLERO.

01:20:30.726 --> 01:20:33.629 region:rollup2
I THINK MISTER CHAIR I AM

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.097 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AT SECOND WHAT'S BEEN

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:35.731 region:rollup2
SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:37.366 region:rollup2
TO THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:37.933 region:rollup2
IT.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:46.075 region:rollup2
PRUDENT BUDGETING PROCESS I

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:46.909 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD THE PRINCIPLE YOU

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:48.243 region:rollup2
WERE DISCUSSING I JUST COULDN'T

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:50.579 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS SO IT IT

01:20:48.243 --> 01:20:51.780 region:rollup2
MAY BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD DO A

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:53.382 region:rollup2
ONE PAGER IF THAT'S AT ALL

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.150 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT.

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:56.618 region:rollup2
EITHER CONSTITUTIONAL OR

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:59.221 region:rollup2
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:21:01.757 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:02.791 region:rollup2
WE PUSH A BUTTON IN ONE SPOT OR

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:04.693 region:rollup2
PHIL.

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:06.628 region:rollup2
APART IN ONCE BUT WHAT IT DOES

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:08.230 region:rollup2
TO THE OVERALL EXPECTATION THE

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:10.532 region:rollup2
COMING YEAR BECAUSE I I THINK

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:12.735 region:rollup2
THAT. THE POINT YOU MADE IS.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.902 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:15.404 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:16.472 region:rollup2
REPEAT IT IN IF I COULDN'T CAN'T

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:19.842 region:rollup2
REPEAT IT THEN I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:20.476 region:rollup2
TO AVOID IT SO IF YOU COULD GET

01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:21.710 region:rollup2
THAT TO A SAID BEATRIZ ACTITUD.

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2
.

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.245 region:rollup2
I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.380 region:rollup2
THE.

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:26.181 region:rollup2
.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.316 region:rollup2
THE FIRE ISSUE IN PARTICULAR AS

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.518 region:rollup2
IT RELATES TO HUNDRED AND TWO

01:21:27.316 --> 01:21:31.520 region:rollup2
MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES.

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:32.821 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.890 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK VERY

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:37.726 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY AT POLICY CHANGES TO

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:39.561 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO GET THOSE TREES.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:41.230 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FALLING DOWN AND

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.132 region:rollup2
CREATING A GREENHOUSE GAS.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:45.267 region:rollup2
EXPLOSION AND.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:47.536 region:rollup2
WITH THE DETERIORATION OF THE

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:50.105 region:rollup2
PARK UP AND PUT THEM TO GOOD USE

01:21:47.536 --> 01:21:53.342 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S THAT REALLY

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:56.345 region:rollup2
WILL HELP RURAL CALIFORNIA. EMAM

01:21:53.342 --> 01:21:57.846 region:rollup2
TURN TALKING ABOUT THAT BIOMASS

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:59.148 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S SOME SOME CHANGES

01:21:57.846 --> 01:22:00.416 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. IN THAT

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.084 region:rollup2
REGARD AND.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:03.619 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:07.122 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IT BECAUSE.

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:11.427 region:rollup2
THE LOSS OF PROPERTY AND LIFE.

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:12.561 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THIS NEW NORMAL IS

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:15.597 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE MCCARTY DO

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:15.998 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO MAKE

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.332 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CAN.

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:19.935 region:rollup2
.

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:22.137 region:rollup2
PROTECT AS MUCH AS WE CAN THE

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:23.338 region:rollup2
THE FUEL SOURCE THAT REALLY HAS

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:25.140 region:rollup2
THESE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.941 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. SO I

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:26.975 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A QUESTION REGARD

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.910 region:rollup2
THAT I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.744 region:rollup2
IT IS AN ISSUE THAT. I'VE BEEN

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:30.112 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING VERY CAREFULLY AND

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:31.747 region:rollup2
CLOSELY AND.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:33.048 region:rollup2
AND IF IT'S IT'S MORE OF A

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:34.183 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER NOT

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:35.284 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF THESE.

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:36.485 region:rollup2
DEAD AND DYING TREES BUT MORE

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:38.987 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY THE LOSS OF LIFE AND

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:40.289 region:rollup2
AND PROPERTIES IS DEVASTATING SO

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:42.591 region:rollup2
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:45.627 region:rollup2
WANNA MOVE REAL QUICKLY SO I

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:47.462 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE FOR THE. WOMAN WHO RAN

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:49.898 region:rollup2
UP ON.

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:51.800 region:rollup2
I'M ON THE COURT SYSTEM AND I

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.968 region:rollup2
AND I I I I WANT TO TALK I HAVE

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.870 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTIONS THAT THAT'S ONE OF

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:57.172 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:59.141 region:rollup2
BUT WITH THE BUDGET USES THEIR

01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:00.075 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BASED ALLOCATION AND

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.743 region:rollup2
FINING METHODOLOGY UP HAD

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:04.012 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH.

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:05.547 region:rollup2
MY LOCAL COURTS AND THAT.

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:08.083 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY HURTS.

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:09.351 region:rollup2
SMALL WORLD. COUNTY COURT COURT

01:23:08.083 --> 01:23:10.652 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:12.020 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SAM BENITO COUNTY IS

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.423 region:rollup2
LAYING OFF

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:16.391 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME STAFF.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:17.826 region:rollup2
OR A CREATING PART TIME JOBS FOR

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:19.494 region:rollup2
THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:20.996 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO KEEP THEM ON STAFF AND

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:23.198 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THAT FUNDING FORMULA

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:25.100 region:rollup2
THAT WEIGHS.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:26.034 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.936 region:rollup2
DURING THE DOWNTURN IN THE

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:30.372 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AS A SOLUTION TO KIND

01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:32.407 region:rollup2
EQUALIZE THE FUNDING. AND I

01:23:30.372 --> 01:23:33.475 region:rollup2
THINK IT IT DOWN I'D LIKE TO TO

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:35.577 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT FUNDING FORMULA TO

01:23:33.475 --> 01:23:37.412 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER IT REALLY. IS

01:23:35.577 --> 01:23:40.148 region:rollup2
THE CORRECT FORMULA.

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:41.350 region:rollup2
ALL.

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:43.085 region:rollup2
IMAGE ARTIST'S DEPARTMENT

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.186 region:rollup2
FINANCE I THINK THAT ON YES I

01:23:43.085 --> 01:23:46.021 region:rollup2
AGREE WORK FIRST ARE THE

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:47.289 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.257 region:rollup2
WAS DEVELOPED A TIME WHEN THE

01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:50.058 region:rollup2
COURTS WERE AND STRUGGLING

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:51.960 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY. AND I THINK WHAT

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:53.295 region:rollup2
THIS IS ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.164 region:rollup2
READJUST.

01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:58.800 region:rollup2
THE AND ALLOCATIONS BASED ON THE

01:23:56.164 --> 01:24:01.270 region:rollup2
NEW AVERAGE CASE WAIT BY COURT.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.772 region:rollup2
SO SAN BENITO WAS ACTUALLY A LOT

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:05.007 region:rollup2
OF THE CASE WAIT.

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.941 region:rollup2
I AM RIGHT NOW IN THEIR AND

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:06.875 region:rollup2
SERENE TERMS THEY'RE FUNNY

01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:08.377 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY THERE ARE ABOUT

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.611 region:rollup2
EIGHTY ONE POINT SEVEN WHERE THE

01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:11.179 region:rollup2
AVERAGE CASE WEIGHT IS SEVENTY

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.813 region:rollup2
SIX POINT NINE.

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:13.081 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:15.317 region:rollup2
THAN THE AVERAGE I UNDERSTAND

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:16.118 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT. AND CERTAINLY THINK

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:18.287 region:rollup2
A LOT OF COURTS ARE STILL

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:19.988 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING THOSE I'M STAFFING

01:24:18.287 --> 01:24:20.822 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE DON'T AND WE AGREE

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:23.225 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A

01:24:20.822 --> 01:24:24.226 region:rollup2
BUDGET A METHODOLOGY. BUT FOR

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.094 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF ESTABLISHING A

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:27.195 region:rollup2
BASELINE IT MADE SENSE FOR US TO

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:29.164 region:rollup2
USE SOME KIND OF STANDARD METRIC

01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.698 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE IT WAS. THE MOST

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:33.435 region:rollup2
RECENT UPDATED I HAVE KEY

01:24:29.698 --> 01:24:35.370 region:rollup2
SWEETS.

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:36.104 region:rollup2
SO I AM JUST WANNA EMPHASIZE

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:37.606 region:rollup2
THAT OF THEIR CERTAIN

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:39.641 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS THAT WE HAVE OF OUR

01:24:37.606 --> 01:24:40.742 region:rollup2
COURT SYSTEM. AND IT DOESN'T

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.476 region:rollup2
MATTER IF YOU'RE A BIG COUNTY OR

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.377 region:rollup2
SMALL COUNTY WE STILL HAVE

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:44.446 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS.

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:46.348 region:rollup2
WHEN THOSE WHEN YOU CAN'T MEET

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:47.883 region:rollup2
THE MANY LONGER AND YOU'RE

01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:49.584 region:rollup2
STARTING TO LAY OFF STAFF.

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:51.787 region:rollup2
BEDDED BEEN AROUND FOR A REALLY

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:53.655 region:rollup2
LONG TIME OR CUT DID THE HOURS

01:24:51.787 --> 01:24:56.358 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLERK'S OFFICE IS OPEN

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:57.693 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S IT IT REALLY HAS AN

01:24:56.358 --> 01:25:00.429 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY SO I

01:24:57.693 --> 01:25:02.364 region:rollup2
THOUGHT SEEMS TO ME. UP AND WE

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:03.932 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THIS MORE THAT THERE

01:25:02.364 --> 01:25:07.602 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE AT LEAST A BASE

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:10.305 region:rollup2
FORMULA. THAT PROVIDES. ADEQUATE

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:11.606 region:rollup2
STAFFING FOR THE COURTS TO BE

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:12.841 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:13.775 region:rollup2
SERVE THE FUNCTIONS SOME BASIC

01:25:12.841 --> 01:25:15.110 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS AND THEN WE LOOK AT

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:17.913 region:rollup2
THE CASE LOAD IN THE KIND OF.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:18.914 region:rollup2
UP THE SERIOUSNESS OF CASES AND.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:20.382 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE OF RESOURCES ARE

01:25:18.914 --> 01:25:21.750 region:rollup2

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:39.768 region:rollup2
DELAYED TO THE DOWNTURN IN THE

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:43.472 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IT IS THERE A SCHEDULE.

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:45.407 region:rollup2
FOR. THE NUMBER OF COURTHOUSES

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:47.576 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IT WOULD

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:49.845 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD AND DO WE KNOW.

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:51.513 region:rollup2

WITH RESPECT CAPACITY.

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.523 region:rollup2
I WANT FOCUS PRINTS UPS

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:50.158 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY ON A HIGHWAY NINETY

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:52.394 region:rollup2
NINE.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.328 region:rollup2
NOT IT IS. ARGUABLY THE MOST

01:28:52.394 --> 01:28:55.297 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THAT COMMERCIAL.

01:28:53.328 --> 01:28:58.066 region:rollup2
.

01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:59.234 region:rollup2
ROUTE IT IS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.001 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO TRAFFIC.

01:28:59.234 --> 01:29:02.737 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:03.271 region:rollup2
.

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:06.074 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:08.577 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:10.846 region:rollup2
OR ANYTHING IN THE S. B. ONE.

01:29:08.577 --> 01:29:12.514 region:rollup2
TAX INCREASE.

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:14.649 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE FOR

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:16.751 region:rollup2
ACCELERATE.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:18.253 region:rollup2
BRINGING THE TWO LANE NORTH

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:19.120 region:rollup2
SOUTH.

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:21.723 region:rollup2
PINCH POINTS ON NINETY NINE UP

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.225 region:rollup2
TO.

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:24.226 region:rollup2
THREE LANE NORTH SOUTH THE

01:29:23.225 --> 01:29:26.628 region:rollup2
REASON I POINT THAT OUT IS

01:29:24.226 --> 01:29:28.663 region:rollup2
RATHER OBVIOUS.

01:29:26.628 --> 01:29:30.699 region:rollup2
WHEN NORTH SOUTH TRAFFIC IS IN

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:31.600 region:rollup2
THREE LANDS.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:33.435 region:rollup2
ARE THERE AT THE LIMIT.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:34.669 region:rollup2
.

01:29:33.435 --> 01:29:37.072 region:rollup2
IT'S SAFER.

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:39.040 region:rollup2
IT THIS OBVIOUSLY SIGNIFICANT

01:29:37.072 --> 01:29:41.576 region:rollup2
FLOW OF OF TRAFFIC WHEN IT GOES

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.411 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THE. THAT PINCH POINTS.

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:44.646 region:rollup2
A TWO LANE PINCH POINTS

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:47.582 region:rollup2
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS COME ON THE

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:50.118 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC SLOWS DOWN. THE.

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:52.520 region:rollup2
FENDER BENDERS GO UP.

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:53.855 region:rollup2
AND THE FRUSTRATION OF DRIVERS.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:57.359 region:rollup2
GO UP AS WELL.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:58.660 region:rollup2
.

01:29:57.359 --> 01:30:00.929 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AT ALL THAT.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.463 region:rollup2
COULD.

01:30:00.929 --> 01:30:02.631 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THOSE OF US WHO

01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:04.699 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:06.368 region:rollup2
THE NINETY NINE.

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:08.270 region:rollup2
THAT SOME OF THE TAX INCREASES

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:09.504 region:rollup2
IN SP ONE.

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:10.705 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE PRIORITIES OF

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:12.841 region:rollup2
THE OF THE GOVERNOR WOULD

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:14.376 region:rollup2
INCLUDE DATA PRIORITIZING AND

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:15.710 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING.

01:30:14.376 --> 01:30:18.713 region:rollup2
BUT THE LATE ADDITIONS TO NINETY

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:20.415 region:rollup2
NINE.

01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:21.716 region:rollup2
I MEAN AS FAR AS THE OF THEM

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:22.951 region:rollup2
STEVE AUSTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCES

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:23.952 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE.

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.753 region:rollup2
THE THE ACTUAL FUNDING OF THE

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:26.521 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT ARE TO

01:30:24.753 --> 01:30:27.522 region:rollup2
BE CHOSEN. IN ALL THE PROJECTS A

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.190 region:rollup2
THREE PROBE THE PROGRAM THROUGH

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:32.160 region:rollup2
THE CTS.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:33.728 region:rollup2
SO THE THE CHOICE OF WHICH

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:35.664 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:30:33.728 --> 01:30:38.266 region:rollup2
FIRST OR TO TO PROGRAM.

01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:39.968 region:rollup2
IT IS MADE BY THEM HOWEVER

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:41.336 region:rollup2
THERE IS A EITHER THERE'S FIVE

01:30:39.968 --> 01:30:43.238 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:30:41.336 --> 01:30:44.572 region:rollup2
COMBINED AVAILABLE EVERY YEAR.

COMMUTER CORRIDORS AND TRADE

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.711 region:rollup2
QUARTER ENHANCEMENT.

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:51.179 region:rollup2
SO THOUGH THOSE FUNDING BUT

01:30:49.711 --> 01:30:52.414 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS NEW.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:54.683 region:rollup2
YET LET'S STRAIGHTEN IT.

01:30:52.414 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY FROM THE NEW S. B. ONE

01:30:54.683 --> 01:30:59.421 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

STATE.

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:58.239 region:rollup2
AFTER NORTH SOUTH THEIR

TRANSPORTATION.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:01.776 region:rollup2
SORT OF IS GETTING I THINK THE.

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:03.478 region:rollup2

OF REASONS.

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:41.182 region:rollup2
ALONG THOSE CORRIDORS ARE

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.716 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT SELF HELP COUNTIES.

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.251 region:rollup2
A FRESNO BEING ONE OF THE

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:45.119 region:rollup2

BUT WE WILL BE DOING THAT.

01:33:55.029 --> 01:33:58.700 region:rollup2
IN AN EFFORT TO REALLY GET TO

01:33:57.065 --> 01:34:00.735 region:rollup2
AN ACCELERATION.

01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:03.304 region:rollup2

NINETY NINE FROM FRESNO TO

01:34:16.818 --> 01:34:19.988 region:rollup2
MADERA EITHER IN TWO LANES I

01:34:17.919 --> 01:34:20.588 region:rollup2

THE NUMBER I CITED ABOVE ROUGHLY

01:36:11.633 --> 01:36:14.202 region:rollup2
OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND IS JUST THE

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:15.436 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT PORTIONS OF

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:16.838 region:rollup2
FEWER TO LOOK AT ALL FUNDING

SOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:20.675 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S UPWARDS OF FOURTEEN

01:36:18.406 --> 01:36:23.378 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:36:20.675 --> 01:36:24.679 region:rollup2

01:36:23.378 --> 01:36:27.115 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MISTER BECAUSE I THINK

01:36:24.679 --> 01:36:29.284 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FOR SOME SCHOOLS. THAT

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:31.285 region:rollup2
HAVE THE THOSE SOME CATEGORIES

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:32.587 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE SEEING THAT THAT

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:33.588 region:rollup2
AMOUNT BECAUSE I SAY THIS

01:36:32.587 --> 01:36:35.189 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HAS AS

01:36:33.588 --> 01:36:37.225 region:rollup2
GIVEN US A CHALLENGE I THINK IN

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:38.559 region:rollup2
A STATEMENT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:36:37.225 --> 01:36:40.161 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:41.329 region:rollup2
HE HAS A SAID WE NEED TO ASK

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:42.330 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE PEOPLE DOING WITH THOSE

01:36:41.329 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO THOSE

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:45.566 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. AND WE ARE BEEN ASKING

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:47.201 region:rollup2
THAT EVER SINCE WE START GIVEN

01:36:45.566 --> 01:36:48.736 region:rollup2
THE MONEY SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:50.138 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOW AS A BUDGET TO A

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:52.006 region:rollup2
NEED TO TALK ABOUT NOT ONLY

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:54.042 region:rollup2
FUNDING BUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:55.243 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS THAT WE GIVE. A SOLD

01:36:54.042 --> 01:36:57.645 region:rollup2
THOSE SCHOOLS THAT WERE KIDS

01:36:55.243 --> 01:36:59.414 region:rollup2
OURS ARE LEAST LIKELY TO.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:00.381 region:rollup2
OR HAVE THE GREATEST CHALLENGES

01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.783 region:rollup2
I SHOULD SAY SHOULD BE LOOKING

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:03.918 region:rollup2
AT A PROBLEM IN THE ADDITIONAL

01:37:01.783 --> 01:37:07.255 region:rollup2
FOUR TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:37:03.918 --> 01:37:08.823 region:rollup2
PER CHILD. IN THOSE SCHOOLS.

01:37:07.255 --> 01:37:09.424 region:rollup2
YEAH I'VE BEEN AVERAGE LET'S

01:37:08.823 --> 01:37:11.225 region:rollup2
READ THAT WOULD BE THE AVERAGE

01:37:09.424 --> 01:37:12.327 region:rollup2
OKAY SO I I HOPE MY SCHOOLS IN

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:13.861 region:rollup2
LISTENING SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT

01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:15.129 region:rollup2
THEY WERE SCHOOLS THAT A POOR.

01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:16.831 region:rollup2
HAVE FOSTER KIDS THAT HAVE KIDS

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:18.700 region:rollup2
AND LANGUAGE ISSUES THOSEKINDS

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:20.034 region:rollup2
OF THINGS SHOULD BE SEEING ABOUT

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.636 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE PER

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:23.671 region:rollup2
CHILD. TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:25.573 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND SUPPORT NECESSARY TO

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:26.407 region:rollup2
CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP.

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:28.276 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S A COULD THAT

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:30.411 region:rollup2
THAT IS HELPFUL.

01:37:28.276 --> 01:37:31.512 region:rollup2
OKAY. LEASING RESIDENTS GET THE

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.447 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND WE CAN

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:35.216 region:rollup2
GET BACK TO WHAT THOSE NUMBERS

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:36.617 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT VERY

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.685 region:rollup2
MUCH SO BECAUSE. OF.

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.286 region:rollup2
WE'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.687 region:rollup2
SEVERAL TIMES AND BUDGETS AND

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.855 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOTTEN THE QUESTION OF

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.956 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE NOT FULLY FUNDED WE

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:44.125 region:rollup2
DON'T REALLY KNOW WOULD NOT

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:45.360 region:rollup2
REALLY THERE THAT WE DON'T. KNOW

01:37:44.125 --> 01:37:45.593 region:rollup2
EXACTLY SO NOW THE WITH THEY

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.595 region:rollup2
APPEAR.

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:48.863 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:50.431 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF MONEY THESE KIDS

01:37:48.863 --> 01:37:51.866 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE RECEIVING. AND WHAT

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:53.668 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS FOR SCHOOLS IN TERMS

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:54.902 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING AND HOPEFULLY CLOSING

01:37:53.668 --> 01:37:56.370 region:rollup2
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT'S THERE

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:57.638 region:rollup2
SO I I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.907 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING.

01:37:57.638 --> 01:38:02.176 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S SOMEONE

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:04.278 region:rollup2
IS MENTIONED AS WITNESSED REPOSE

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:05.179 region:rollup2
INCOMMUNICADO IT.

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.614 region:rollup2
NOW TO MAKE IT YEAH ONLINE

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:07.448 region:rollup2
COMPUTER COLLEGE AND I'M GONNA

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.716 region:rollup2
HAVE MY COMMUNICATIVE BECAUSE

01:38:07.448 --> 01:38:09.650 region:rollup2
THEY ALL HAVE LOTS OF ONLINE

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:11.185 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:11.853 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M WONDERING WHAT WHAT

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:13.354 region:rollup2
IS THE ADVANTAGE OF SETTING UP A

01:38:11.853 --> 01:38:15.990 region:rollup2
TOTALLY DIFFERENT BUREAUCRATIC

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:17.492 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. FULL ONLINE

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:19.427 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTION AYE I. YOU KNOW

01:38:17.492 --> 01:38:20.728 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ONLINE INSTRUCTION IS

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:22.330 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THEY'RE PROBABLY MORE

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:23.498 region:rollup2
OF A COMMUNICATIVE MAY NEVER SEE

01:38:22.330 --> 01:38:24.732 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND UC'S.

01:38:23.498 --> 01:38:26.434 region:rollup2
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.935 region:rollup2
IS THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:30.438 region:rollup2
SPECIALISMS ONLINE INSTRUCTION

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:33.107 region:rollup2
JUST AS AN ENTITY HAS SAW MANY.

01:38:30.438 --> 01:38:34.942 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF QUALITY

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:36.444 region:rollup2
AND OUTCOME AND ASSURANCE OF

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:37.378 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING

01:38:36.444 --> 01:38:38.780 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING.

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:40.815 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.316 region:rollup2
SOME I'M WONDERING WHAT'S THE

01:38:40.815 --> 01:38:43.684 region:rollup2
RATIONALE FOR THAT.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:45.219 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SO WE WANT TO

01:38:43.684 --> 01:38:47.321 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TARGET THIS ONLINE

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:48.656 region:rollup2
COLLEGE TO INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:50.224 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:51.459 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SEGMENTS

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:53.561 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO POINT FIVE

01:38:51.459 --> 01:38:55.596 region:rollup2
MILLION WORKING CALIFORNIANS.

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:58.266 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WORKING FULL TIME THEY

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:59.901 region:rollup2
HAVE CHILDREN AND THEY NEED MORE

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:01.135 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WHICH WE BELIEVE AN

01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:02.370 region:rollup2
ONLINE PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE FOR

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:03.971 region:rollup2
THEM?

01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:06.207 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO PROPOSING THAT THERE

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:07.575 region:rollup2
BE IN PERSON SUPPORTS WE'VE SEEN

01:39:06.207 --> 01:39:09.844 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH ENOUGH COMPLETELY

01:39:07.575 --> 01:39:12.447 region:rollup2
ON ENVIRONMENT HAVE.

01:39:09.844 --> 01:39:14.315 region:rollup2
SOME CHALLENGES ALONG WITH IT

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:17.084 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THESE

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:19.086 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE ATTENDING ONLINE

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:20.621 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUT OF STATE FOR A COST

01:39:19.086 --> 01:39:21.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT WE

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:23.224 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE TO OUR COMMUNITY

01:39:21.923 --> 01:39:24.959 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

01:39:23.224 --> 01:39:26.427 region:rollup2
ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY AND

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:27.662 region:rollup2
OTHER WESTERN GOVERNORS ARE

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:29.230 region:rollup2
OFFERING THESE PROGRAMS TO

01:39:27.662 --> 01:39:30.965 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITHIN CALIFORNIA SO WE'D

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:32.567 region:rollup2
LIKE TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE KICK

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:33.701 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:39:32.567 --> 01:39:36.037 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH SERVING

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:39.540 region:rollup2
THIS POPULATION OF STUDENTS AND

01:39:36.037 --> 01:39:41.042 region:rollup2
KEEP LOW COST.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.210 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:42.610 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND I'M I

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:43.477 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES WONDER.

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:45.213 region:rollup2
.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:47.148 region:rollup2
HAVING LIVED THROUGH A WHOLE

01:39:45.213 --> 01:39:47.715 region:rollup2
LOT DIFFERENT CYCLES OF OF HER

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:50.751 region:rollup2
IT.

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:53.354 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETIMES THE.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:54.889 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IN ONLINE INSTRUCTION

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:56.557 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUT OF STATE IS BECAUSE

01:39:54.889 --> 01:39:57.625 region:rollup2
OF ITS NOT THAT IS MORE

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:58.759 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBLE IS THAT THEY'RE

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:00.228 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE FEWER DEMANDS MADE

01:39:58.759 --> 01:40:01.629 region:rollup2
ON THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:40:00.228 --> 01:40:02.730 region:rollup2
AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE

01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:03.998 region:rollup2
GOING TO COMPETE IS YOU CAN

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:05.233 region:rollup2
COMPETE TO THE POINT THAT YOU

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:06.701 region:rollup2
GET TO THE LOWEST LEVEL. OF

01:40:05.233 --> 01:40:08.536 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENT

01:40:06.701 --> 01:40:10.104 region:rollup2
EQUALITY AND SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE

01:40:08.536 --> 01:40:11.939 region:rollup2
OF COMPETING.

01:40:10.104 --> 01:40:12.740 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:14.175 region:rollup2
AND I SAY THIS IN BECAUSE

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.244 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MANY ONLINE COURSES

01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:17.845 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO MANY NOT ONLY.

01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:18.980 region:rollup2
THE OF THE PRIVATE ONES BUT OUR

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:20.314 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE A

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.849 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ONLINE

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:23.651 region:rollup2
COURSES AND I PROBABLY HAVEN'T

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:25.520 region:rollup2
HAD A PERSON'S WORK FOR ME WAS

01:40:23.651 --> 01:40:27.154 region:rollup2
NOT TAKEN AN ONLINE COURSE.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.123 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE COMMUTER COLLEGES

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:30.057 region:rollup2
OF BUT I DO KNOW THAT OF THE

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.025 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES THAT ARE MORE

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:33.694 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE OFTEN MARKET

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:34.662 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES. AS NOT HAVING TO DO

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:36.497 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OR THEY'LL COUNT ALL

01:40:34.662 --> 01:40:38.900 region:rollup2
THE. YOUR WORK LIFE AND YOU THIS

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:41.402 region:rollup2
NEED THAT TOWARD THE CREDIT OF

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:42.937 region:rollup2
OF ONE CHEATING SOMETHING SO I'M

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:44.772 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT WE DON'T GET INTO

01:40:42.937 --> 01:40:46.173 region:rollup2
THE COMPETITIVE THING. AND

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:48.309 region:rollup2
DISCOVER THAT IT MAY NOT BE

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:50.344 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY AND MAYBE

01:40:48.309 --> 01:40:53.247 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN WE FIND

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:55.383 region:rollup2
OURSELVES. ARE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:40:53.247 --> 01:40:56.584 region:rollup2
WHO CAN GO TO THE LOWEST RUNG

01:40:55.383 --> 01:41:00.021 region:rollup2
THOUGH OF PERFORMANCE AND

01:40:56.584 --> 01:41:02.790 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT. OF SO I HAVE TO I

01:41:00.021 --> 01:41:05.326 region:rollup2
HOPE WE LOOK AT THAT CAREFULLY.

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:07.094 region:rollup2
IF WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING OUR

01:41:05.326 --> 01:41:09.063 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT A HIGHER

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:12.066 region:rollup2
LEVEL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:13.634 region:rollup2
COURSES THAT ONLINE. A THAT'S

01:41:12.066 --> 01:41:16.938 region:rollup2
ONE THING BUT A SIMPLE

01:41:13.634 --> 01:41:20.474 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRATIC STRUCTURE THIS

01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:22.543 region:rollup2
STRICTLY ONLINE ABOUT IT HAS

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:25.046 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERNS ME.

01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:29.383 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE ALL YOU'VE YOU'VE

01:41:25.046 --> 01:41:32.753 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF LOW OF

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:38.292 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR ALL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:40.094 region:rollup2
IN WORK ON.

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:41.963 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU PRIORITIZE IT WITH

01:41:40.094 --> 01:41:44.165 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO WHAT PRISONS IF WE

01:41:41.963 --> 01:41:46.934 region:rollup2
WERE TO START CLOSING PRISONS

01:41:44.165 --> 01:41:49.003 region:rollup2
WHAT PRISONS WOULD PROBABLY BE

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:50.171 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST LEVEL FOR CLOSING

01:41:49.003 --> 01:41:52.006 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE DON'T END UP DOING

01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:56.844 region:rollup2
GREAT REPAIRS.

01:41:52.006 --> 01:42:00.348 region:rollup2
IN THAT I KNOW THE FANS ARE

01:41:56.844 --> 01:42:01.682 region:rollup2
NOTORIOUS FOR DOING THAT OF A

01:42:00.348 --> 01:42:06.887 region:rollup2
BILL TO HOLD OUT OF ONE OF THE

01:42:01.682 --> 01:42:11.125 region:rollup2
STUFF IN SAN DIEGO MCI DE THEN

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:13.194 region:rollup2
SHUT IT DOWN TO HIT. THEATERS IN

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:14.929 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL PEOPLE NEVER DONE

ANYTHING IN BUT THEY WERE BRAND

01:42:14.929 --> 01:42:21.035 region:rollup2

AND ALL OF THESE.

01:46:25.546 --> 01:46:29.650 region:rollup2
WELCOME BACK TO ONE THING.

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:31.452 region:rollup2
AND IT'S.

01:46:29.650 --> 01:46:32.453 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER.

01:46:31.452 --> 01:46:34.421 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE THE

01:46:32.453 --> 01:46:35.422 region:rollup2
FOREST THE IT'S AN ALL STARTS

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:37.625 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE.

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:39.960 region:rollup2
IN SO.

01:46:37.625 --> 01:46:41.629 region:rollup2

WHO UNDERSTAND THIS THE BEST.

01:46:50.871 --> 01:46:55.409 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SAVE SOME

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:56.543 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY ON THE OTHER END?

01:46:55.409 --> 01:46:58.646 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PAY FOR

01:46:56.543 --> 01:47:00.914 region:rollup2
MORE CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN

01:46:58.646 --> 01:47:03.317 region:rollup2
CLEANING UP GIANT MUD SLIDES AND

01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:04.818 region:rollup2
WIPED OUT ENTIRE AREAS IN KILL

01:47:03.317 --> 01:47:07.388 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AND THESE HORRIBLE FOR.

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:09.123 region:rollup2
WORST FIRES WE CAN ACTUALLY GO

01:47:07.388 --> 01:47:09.923 region:rollup2
DO THE RIGHT THING ON ONE END.

01:47:09.123 --> 01:47:11.592 region:rollup2
AND TAKE CARE THE PROBLEM UP

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:12.593 region:rollup2
FRONT.

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:13.093 region:rollup2
STATE OF SPENDING MILLIONS AND

01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:15.229 region:rollup2
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:16.397 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:17.364 region:rollup2
ON THE BACK IN BECAUSE WE CAN DO

01:47:16.397 --> 01:47:18.799 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT THING IN THE FIRST

01:47:17.364 --> 01:47:20.634 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:23.037 region:rollup2
SO NOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:26.674 region:rollup2
YEAR WE'VE HAD MASSIVE

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:28.542 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHIC FIRES CATASTROPHIC.

01:47:26.674 --> 01:47:31.245 region:rollup2
FLOODS MUD SLIDES

01:47:28.542 --> 01:47:32.579 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE MIND LOSS OF LIFE.

01:47:31.245 --> 01:47:34.481 region:rollup2
ALL BECAUSE WE SIMPLY DIDN'T

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:35.482 region:rollup2
SPEND THE MONEY.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:37.284 region:rollup2
YEAH AT THE FRONT END OF THE

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:39.453 region:rollup2
FOREST.

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:42.222 region:rollup2
THE IN LISTEN TO THE FORRESTERS

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:44.525 region:rollup2
IN AND GET A RIGHT THERE.

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:46.126 region:rollup2
SO WHY THEY ARE THEIR ANALYTICS

01:47:44.525 --> 01:47:47.861 region:rollup2
DON THAT SHOW HIM MAYBE IF WE

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.929 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SPEND THAT THE MONEY TO

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:50.764 region:rollup2
DO THIS UP HERE.

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:52.099 region:rollup2
WE WERE ALL.

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:54.768 region:rollup2
PAY OUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

01:47:52.099 --> 01:47:55.903 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:57.571 region:rollup2
WHAT ONE THING THAT I THINK IS

01:47:55.903 --> 01:47:59.173 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO TO THINK ABOUT AND

01:47:57.571 --> 01:48:00.774 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST MY FIRST?

01:47:59.173 --> 01:48:02.343 region:rollup2
OKAY A ONE THING THAT'S HELPFUL

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:03.477 region:rollup2
TO THINK ABOUT IS AS PART OF CAP

01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:05.212 region:rollup2
AND TRADE LAST YEAR WE HAD THE

01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:06.880 region:rollup2
STATE RESPONSE RESPONSIBILITY

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:09.683 region:rollup2

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.118 region:rollup2
WE STOPPED THAT FEET BUT. AS

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:12.686 region:rollup2
FAR AS SKILL IN SCOPE IT WAS

01:48:11.118 --> 01:48:15.756 region:rollup2
ABOUT AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:17.791 region:rollup2

TO BACK FEELING THAT FEED THE

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:21.328 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:23.764 region:rollup2
INCLUDED TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OF

FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE VERY

01:48:23.764 --> 01:48:27.434 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE WITH IN

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:28.902 region:rollup2

COUNCILS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:32.272 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAD

01:48:30.637 --> 01:48:35.709 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:48:32.272 --> 01:48:36.543 region:rollup2
CAL LOW WE ASK FOR OUR MUTUAL

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.344 region:rollup2
AID LOCAL MUTUAL AID.

01:48:36.543 --> 01:48:39.446 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE PUT IN THE CURRENT

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:40.814 region:rollup2
YEAR SIGNIFICANT NEW RESOURCES

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:42.182 region:rollup2
IN FORCE MANAGEMENT AND ADDITION

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:43.484 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE BASELINE BUDGET

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:45.853 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE FOR

01:48:43.484 --> 01:48:46.787 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE AND OTHER ENTITIES.

01:48:45.853 --> 01:48:49.289 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED

01:48:46.787 --> 01:48:51.225 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY TRUE IMMORTALITY IS.

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:52.626 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED THAT SCALE AND

01:48:51.225 --> 01:48:53.527 region:rollup2
SCOPE I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S

01:48:52.626 --> 01:48:55.829 region:rollup2
UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:57.431 region:rollup2
MILLION A DEAD AND DYING TREES.

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:59.433 region:rollup2
AND SO OUR HOPE IS OBVIOUSLY

01:48:57.431 --> 01:49:01.268 region:rollup2
THIS INFUSION OF HIGH.

01:48:59.433 --> 01:49:02.403 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL GTR OFF MONEY WILL

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:03.771 region:rollup2
HELP US DEAL WITH THIS

01:49:02.403 --> 01:49:05.806 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED DISASTER AND ARE

01:49:03.771 --> 01:49:07.307 region:rollup2
FORCED.

01:49:05.806 --> 01:49:07.875 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE IS THAT FUNDING

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.076 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING WITHIN THOSE

01:49:07.875 --> 01:49:10.644 region:rollup2
BUDGET

01:49:09.076 --> 01:49:12.046 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF ITS IT'S ONE THING TO

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:14.848 region:rollup2
SAY WE'RE GONNA OF HE CALIPHATE

01:49:12.046 --> 01:49:16.016 region:rollup2
OR? OR OR PUT IN ONE AREA BUT

01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:17.151 region:rollup2
IT'S A WHOLE OTHER TO SAY THEM

01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:19.153 region:rollup2
LAYS ACTUALLY GONNA BE

01:49:17.151 --> 01:49:22.856 region:rollup2
INTERJECTED INTO CREATING FOR

01:49:19.153 --> 01:49:24.458 region:rollup2
THREE CONTRACTS TO DO FORESTRY.

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:26.160 region:rollup2
DID INVEST PRACTICES IN FORESTRY

01:49:24.458 --> 01:49:27.461 region:rollup2
VERSUS SOMETHING ELSE

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.962 region:rollup2
HE'S I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD

01:49:27.461 --> 01:49:31.465 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT THAT'S WHERE THE KEY

01:49:28.962 --> 01:49:32.633 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THAT'S BECAUSE THEN.

01:49:31.465 --> 01:49:34.935 region:rollup2
BECAUSE LIFE IN LAND DOWN THE

01:49:32.633 --> 01:49:35.135 region:rollup2
ROAD.

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:36.970 region:rollup2
THE.

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:38.539 region:rollup2
GTR UP FUNDS THE OVER TWO

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:40.074 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION ARE ALLOCATED TO

01:49:38.539 --> 01:49:41.775 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE BUT THE DECISIONS ARE

01:49:40.074 --> 01:49:43.444 region:rollup2
MADE REGIONALLY WITH CAL FIRE

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:44.445 region:rollup2
STAFF OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE

01:49:43.444 --> 01:49:45.979 region:rollup2
ISSUES THROUGHOUT OUR FORCES

01:49:44.445 --> 01:49:47.648 region:rollup2
HAVE AS LIKE DIFFERENCES

01:49:45.979 --> 01:49:49.850 region:rollup2
REGIONALLY. SO IT REALLY IS A

01:49:47.648 --> 01:49:51.485 region:rollup2
LOCAL BASED OUR DECISION MAKING

01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:52.920 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND THEY ARE GRANTS.

01:49:51.485 --> 01:49:54.621 region:rollup2
ON THAT GO OUT.

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.556 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY IN PREVIOUS YEARS

01:49:54.621 --> 01:49:56.924 region:rollup2
WE'VE INCLUDED A LOCAL

01:49:55.556 --> 01:49:59.193 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE MONEY FOR TREE

01:49:56.924 --> 01:50:00.861 region:rollup2
REMOVAL AYE AND RULE COUNTIES

01:49:59.193 --> 01:50:02.329 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE HIGH COST ACTUALLY

01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:04.031 region:rollup2
TO REMOVE SOME OF THESE DEAD AND

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:06.400 region:rollup2
DYING TREES ESPECIALLY FOR.

01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:08.435 region:rollup2
COUNTIES BEYOND FOR HOMEOWNERS

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.471 region:rollup2
FRANKLY ON THE THAT WE HAVE HOT

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:12.673 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AND TO HELP OFFSET

01:50:10.471 --> 01:50:14.141 region:rollup2
THAT COST IS ONE THE PAST.

01:50:12.673 --> 01:50:15.342 region:rollup2
SO BACK THE REPRESSION OTHER

01:50:14.141 --> 01:50:19.580 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS THE SHOW THE COST

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:20.647 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.182 region:rollup2
STEVEN BENSON DEPARTMENT OF

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:23.617 region:rollup2
FINANCE AYE I DON'T YOU CAN

01:50:22.182 --> 01:50:24.151 region:rollup2
ANSWER JUST YES OR NO YEAH I I

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:26.386 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THERE'S GREAT

01:50:24.151 --> 01:50:27.287 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS TO HAND OVER TO SAY

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:29.056 region:rollup2
HERE THIS THIS IS THE KIND A.

01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.891 region:rollup2
OF THE.

01:50:29.056 --> 01:50:32.593 region:rollup2
THE PAYOFF OF THE AND DOLLARS

01:50:30.891 --> 01:50:33.093 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE FUTURE THAT I THINK

01:50:32.593 --> 01:50:34.027 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW IS NOT GREAT

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:36.163 region:rollup2
ANALYTICS.

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:37.531 region:rollup2
AWESOME.

01:50:36.163 --> 01:50:38.899 region:rollup2
I ANALYTICS WERE TRYING TO

01:50:37.531 --> 01:50:40.767 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATE MORE SINCE IT'S

01:50:38.899 --> 01:50:41.201 region:rollup2
COMING FROM GIGI ARE ASKED.

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:42.903 region:rollup2
IS.

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:45.205 region:rollup2
THE REDUCTION OF POTENTIAL

01:50:42.903 --> 01:50:47.040 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:48.141 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT'S SOME OF THE

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.642 region:rollup2
INTERNAL DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.409 region:rollup2
HAVING ON TO MEASURE THE

01:50:48.642 --> 01:50:51.578 region:rollup2
OVERALL.

01:50:49.409 --> 01:50:53.714 region:rollup2
.

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:54.848 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT COULD FORCE

01:50:53.714 --> 01:50:58.118 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT HOUSE ON REDUCING

01:50:54.848 --> 01:51:00.554 region:rollup2
FUTURE ADMISSION.

01:50:58.118 --> 01:51:02.289 region:rollup2
LA JOH GOES HAVE ANYTHING NOT

01:51:00.554 --> 01:51:09.963 region:rollup2
NOTHING THAT RIGHT NOW BUT WE

01:51:02.289 --> 01:51:11.198 region:rollup2
CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO IT OKAY.

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:12.1000 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR AND I THINK.

01:51:11.198 --> 01:51:14.468 region:rollup2
WALTER SHOULD JUST REAL QUICK

01:51:12.1000 --> 01:51:16.403 region:rollup2
BACK TO WELL WHAT ASSEMBLY

01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:16.970 region:rollup2
MEMBER PATTERSON TO SAY WITH THE

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:18.405 region:rollup2
NINETY NINE TRADE QUARTER.

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:21.008 region:rollup2
.

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:23.610 region:rollup2
THE IT STILL BEYOND ME THAT.

01:51:21.008 --> 01:51:25.245 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL AREA IN

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.712 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE WORLD AND IN THE

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:28.282 region:rollup2
ENTIRE COUNTRY. THAT'S

01:51:25.712 --> 01:51:30.551 region:rollup2
PRODUCING.

01:51:28.282 --> 01:51:32.186 region:rollup2
NEARLY SEVEN BILLION GDP WAY

01:51:30.551 --> 01:51:34.054 region:rollup2
WHICH IS DOUBLE ANY OTHER STATE

01:51:32.186 --> 01:51:37.190 region:rollup2
THE NATION.

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:40.594 region:rollup2
IS ON THAT CORRIDOR WE GET.

01:51:37.190 --> 01:51:42.262 region:rollup2
AS THE STATE WE STILL HAVE AN.

01:51:40.594 --> 01:51:43.463 region:rollup2
MAY THAT QUARTER ACTUAL CORRIDOR

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:45.032 region:rollup2
AND WE STILL HAVE THESE PINCH

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.599 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT ARE TWO LANES.

01:51:45.032 --> 01:51:47.401 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT'S THE YOU CAN SAY

01:51:45.599 --> 01:51:48.835 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:51:47.401 --> 01:51:51.038 region:rollup2
A WE DECIDE THESE THINGS OVER

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:52.506 region:rollup2
HERE BOYD.

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:54.241 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE RELIGIOUS FOOD

01:51:52.506 --> 01:51:55.676 region:rollup2
COMES FROM IN HERE.

01:51:54.241 --> 01:51:58.078 region:rollup2
THE STATE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING

01:51:55.676 --> 01:52:00.213 region:rollup2
TO HELP MOVE.

01:51:58.078 --> 01:52:01.982 region:rollup2
ANY OF THAT NAY IN INCREASED

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:03.684 region:rollup2
LENGTH CAPACITY THEIR WORDS.

01:52:01.982 --> 01:52:06.520 region:rollup2
VERY VERY NEEDED IN IT'S BEEN

01:52:03.684 --> 01:52:08.255 region:rollup2
SAID FOR THE LAST DECADE ON HOW

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:09.256 region:rollup2
NEEDED THAT IS. AND WHEN YOU

01:52:08.255 --> 01:52:11.225 region:rollup2
TACK GAINING YOU SAY THERE'S

01:52:09.256 --> 01:52:12.559 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT ARE GONNA TAKE

01:52:11.225 --> 01:52:13.961 region:rollup2
FIVE SIX YEARS.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:16.029 region:rollup2
WE SIT HERE WE GET THESE OUR

01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:18.131 region:rollup2
POPULATION PROJECTION NUMBERS

01:52:16.029 --> 01:52:19.800 region:rollup2
WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE TO

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:20.901 region:rollup2
TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.202 region:rollup2
IN BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE GONNA

01:52:20.901 --> 01:52:23.604 region:rollup2
BE A THIRTY MILLION BY TWENTY

01:52:22.202 --> 01:52:24.338 region:rollup2
FIFTY WERE GONNA BE AT EIGHTY

01:52:23.604 --> 01:52:26.473 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:52:24.338 --> 01:52:29.009 region:rollup2
AND.

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:30.711 region:rollup2
THE FACT IS AND IN WHAT ALONG

01:52:29.009 --> 01:52:32.279 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE NUMBERS WE GET. SIXTY

01:52:30.711 --> 01:52:33.380 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF THAT GROWTH IS

01:52:32.279 --> 01:52:34.748 region:rollup2
GOING TO GO TO THE SOUTHERN SAN

01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:35.849 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN VALLEY.

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:37.684 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT NINETY NINE TRADE

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:38.652 region:rollup2
CORRIDOR.

01:52:37.684 --> 01:52:39.987 region:rollup2
SO IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL THESE

01:52:38.652 --> 01:52:40.854 region:rollup2
YEARS TO BUILD IT.

01:52:39.987 --> 01:52:43.090 region:rollup2
IN THAT'S THE POPULATION

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:44.191 region:rollup2
PROJECTION.

01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:45.292 region:rollup2
THEN WE NEED TO GET WITH THE

01:52:44.191 --> 01:52:46.393 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND START ACTUALLY

01:52:45.292 --> 01:52:47.327 region:rollup2
CALCULATING SOME OF THAT

01:52:46.393 --> 01:52:49.463 region:rollup2
POPULATION PROJECTION OF THOSE

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:50.831 region:rollup2
NUMBERS.

01:52:49.463 --> 01:52:52.599 region:rollup2
SO IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE

01:52:50.831 --> 01:52:54.768 region:rollup2
ON THAT OR WE JUST LOOKING AT

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:58.672 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEEDED TEN YEARS AGO AND

01:52:54.768 --> 01:53:00.474 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL NOT CATCHING UP.

01:52:58.672 --> 01:53:02.309 region:rollup2
THE SP ONE FUNDING EVERY WEEK

01:53:00.474 --> 01:53:03.443 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:53:02.309 --> 01:53:04.845 region:rollup2
THE AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR.

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:06.480 region:rollup2
.

01:53:04.845 --> 01:53:08.782 region:rollup2
ANYHOW WE REPAIRS HAS BEEN

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:10.384 region:rollup2
DECLINING OVER THE LAST YOU

01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:11.685 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE YEARS LIBS LONG AS I'VE

01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:13.287 region:rollup2
BEEN ON THE PHONE FOR AT LEAST

01:53:11.685 --> 01:53:13.687 region:rollup2
LAST TEN YEARS.

01:53:13.287 --> 01:53:15.522 region:rollup2
AND.

01:53:13.687 --> 01:53:17.224 region:rollup2
YOUNG TWO GIVEN THE OF THE FACT

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:18.191 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S A IT'S A PER GALLON

01:53:17.224 --> 01:53:19.793 region:rollup2
YOU WE COLLECT EIGHTEEN CENTS A

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:21.695 region:rollup2
GALLON. PER GALLON IN THE GAS

01:53:19.793 --> 01:53:23.330 region:rollup2
MILEAGE IS BEEN GOING UP SO EVEN

01:53:21.695 --> 01:53:24.665 region:rollup2
WITH ADDITIONAL VEHICLE MILES

01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:26.033 region:rollup2
TRAVELED ADDITIONAL POPULATION.

01:53:24.665 --> 01:53:27.301 region:rollup2
THE NET DOLLARS HAVE BEEN GOING

01:53:26.033 --> 01:53:28.602 region:rollup2
DOWN SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT A

01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:29.202 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE HAD

01:53:28.602 --> 01:53:30.370 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY TO DO ALL OF THE

01:53:29.202 --> 01:53:32.539 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:34.408 region:rollup2
NO.

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:36.343 region:rollup2
S. B. ONENESS HAS GIVEN US AN

01:53:34.408 --> 01:53:37.911 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK FORWARD TO

01:53:36.343 --> 01:53:39.946 region:rollup2
LOOK IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND.

01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:40.747 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE DIFFERENT AREAS

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:42.249 region:rollup2
OF PLACES LIKE HIGHWAY NINETY

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:44.785 region:rollup2
NINE IS A VERY IMPORTANT TRADE

01:53:42.249 --> 01:53:45.385 region:rollup2
CORRIDORS VERY IMPORTANT JUST

01:53:44.785 --> 01:53:45.619 region:rollup2
CONGESTED CORRIDOR FOR PEOPLE

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:47.087 region:rollup2
TRAVEL.

01:53:45.619 --> 01:53:48.422 region:rollup2
.

01:53:47.087 --> 01:53:50.624 region:rollup2
YEAH WE WERE WERE EXPANDING THE

01:53:48.422 --> 01:53:52.559 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AS WE SPEAK I BELIEVE

01:53:50.624 --> 01:53:55.028 region:rollup2
CDCS LOOKING AT ADDING A BILLION

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:57.030 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL PROJECTS

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:58.298 region:rollup2
JUST IN APRIL. ONTO THIS OF THE.

01:53:57.030 --> 01:54:00.033 region:rollup2
.

PROGRAM WILL HAVE.

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:16.316 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWELVE BILLION

01:54:14.114 --> 01:54:18.885 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN CAPACITY SO THAT'S

01:54:16.316 --> 01:54:21.088 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE OVER. A

01:54:18.885 --> 01:54:22.689 region:rollup2
TOTAL CAPACITY BEFORE A IN THE

AROUND TEN BILLION SO THIS IS

01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:30.497 region:rollup2
JUST OVER ABOVE THAT.

01:54:26.893 --> 01:54:32.132 region:rollup2
SO DOES THE.

01:54:30.497 --> 01:54:34.234 region:rollup2

THAT'S ODDITIES THAT HAS IT MUCH

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.952 region:rollup2

MEMBER

01:55:01.061 --> 01:55:03.697 region:rollup2
WE GO ALONG AND WE'RE FIXING THE

01:55:02.396 --> 01:55:04.731 region:rollup2
ROADS WERE ALSO LOOKING TO

01:55:03.697 --> 01:55:06.466 region:rollup2
EXPAND THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO

01:55:04.731 --> 01:55:08.902 region:rollup2

THE GF SIDE AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:55:13.607 --> 01:55:17.544 region:rollup2
SO IF THE GOAL IS YOU ONLY HIT

01:55:15.342 --> 01:55:19.045 region:rollup2
THAT PIECE THE HIGHWAY WANTS AND

01:55:17.544 --> 01:55:20.747 region:rollup2
ONLY HIT ONE OF THAT IS THE GOAL

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:21.381 region:rollup2
THE GOAL BECAUSE THAT NEVER NOW

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.315 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OR WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.417 region:rollup2

TO GO FIX A POTHOLE.

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:32.259 region:rollup2
AND A YEAR LATER COME BACK.

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:33.760 region:rollup2

KNIT DO THAT'S.

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:40.867 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:42.369 region:rollup2
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY IF WE IF WE

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:44.004 region:rollup2
CAN IDENTIFY THAT THOSE TYPE OF

01:55:42.369 --> 01:55:45.539 region:rollup2

WILL START COMING INTO PLAY NOW

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:59.579 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT SO. YOU KNOW A

01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:01.114 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS WE'VE DONE SO FAR

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:03.516 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS XCELERATED PROJECTS

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:05.619 region:rollup2
ARE. AN ATTEMPT TO DO THE THINGS

01:57:03.516 --> 01:57:06.586 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN DO THAT WERE ALREADY

01:57:05.619 --> 01:57:08.054 region:rollup2

YOU'RE COUNTING IN THE MATRIX

01:57:14.995 --> 01:57:16.096 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE POPULATION

01:57:15.529 --> 01:57:17.797 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

01:57:16.096 --> 01:57:19.232 region:rollup2
AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE THE

01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:19.799 region:rollup2
FUTURISTS WOULD TELL US THAT IN

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:21.067 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS FROM NOW EVERYBODY

01:57:19.799 --> 01:57:22.869 region:rollup2

01:57:28.108 --> 01:57:30.844 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THAT IF I MAY WE

01:57:29.609 --> 01:57:32.078 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE A DEMOGRAPHICS

01:57:30.844 --> 01:57:34.214 region:rollup2
CHAPTER WHICH ENCOURAGE EVERYONE

01:57:32.078 --> 01:57:36.216 region:rollup2
TO READ IN OUR SUMMARY AND IT

01:57:34.214 --> 01:57:37.918 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS US. ONLY SLIGHTLY

01:57:36.216 --> 01:57:39.519 region:rollup2
HIGHER THE NATIONAL POPULATION

01:57:37.918 --> 01:57:41.588 region:rollup2
GROWTH CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY NOT

01:57:39.519 --> 01:57:42.789 region:rollup2
GROWING AS IT ONCE DID AND WE

01:57:41.588 --> 01:57:44.357 region:rollup2
EXPECT THE NEXT DOUBLING OF THE

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:45.358 region:rollup2
POPULATION TO TAKE PLACE IN

01:57:44.357 --> 01:57:47.294 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE YEARS.

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:48.128 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE ARE POPULOUS STATE

01:57:47.294 --> 01:57:49.896 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT.

01:57:48.128 --> 01:57:51.264 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS THAT ARE

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:53.233 region:rollup2
DRIVING A LITTLE BIT SLOWING OF

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:55.502 region:rollup2

SURPLUS I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO SEE

IT MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR WOULD

02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:09.302 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY MYSELF.

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:10.570 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS NOT A CITY COUNCIL

CAN'T HELP YOU WE HAVE TO DO WE

02:00:18.578 --> 02:00:21.114 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO FOR THE BUDGET

02:00:19.112 --> 02:00:22.449 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

02:00:21.114 --> 02:00:24.284 region:rollup2
OF THE ENTITY AM ELECTED TO

THAT WHETHER. YOU I DON'T THEM

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:35.395 region:rollup2
OUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

02:00:33.493 --> 02:00:36.463 region:rollup2
SETTING ASIDE IT DOESN'T MATTER

02:00:35.395 --> 02:00:38.098 region:rollup2
REALLY AS MUCH AS.

02:00:36.463 --> 02:00:39.632 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION.

02:00:38.098 --> 02:00:41.301 region:rollup2
OR RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARD TO

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:44.270 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT'S MONEY PUT SHOULD BE

02:00:41.301 --> 02:00:44.270 region:rollup2
PUT RESERVE SHOULD PAY DOWN.

02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:46.473 region:rollup2
IS IT BETTER OFF MAYBE TO PAY

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:48.141 region:rollup2
DOWN DEBT BECAUSE YOU MAKE IT A

02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:50.009 region:rollup2
THREE TO ONE RATIO IN THE OUT

02:00:48.141 --> 02:00:51.644 region:rollup2
YEARS. CAN YOU JUST EXTRAPOLATE

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:52.545 region:rollup2
ON THAT A BIT SURE AGAIN IT'S

02:00:51.644 --> 02:00:53.947 region:rollup2
SORT OF BALANCING THESE

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:55.715 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT NEEDS.

02:00:53.947 --> 02:00:57.050 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANNA HAVE A BIGGER

02:00:55.715 --> 02:00:57.650 region:rollup2
RESERVE YOU CAN BE CAUTIOUS

02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:59.586 region:rollup2
ABOUT MAKING THAT OPTIONAL

02:00:57.650 --> 02:01:01.454 region:rollup2
PAYMENT YOU CAN CONSIDER OTHER

02:00:59.586 --> 02:01:03.423 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT MAYBE YOU CAN.

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:05.592 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THOSE THAT SAME IMPACT

02:01:03.423 --> 02:01:06.326 region:rollup2
OF A RESERVE FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN

02:01:05.592 --> 02:01:08.094 region:rollup2
PUT MONEY IN YOUR DISCRETION

02:01:06.326 --> 02:01:09.963 region:rollup2
RESERVE YOU COULD. PREPAY SOME

02:01:08.094 --> 02:01:11.431 region:rollup2
CALPERS COST.

02:01:09.963 --> 02:01:13.266 region:rollup2
OF THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU

02:01:11.431 --> 02:01:14.901 region:rollup2
COULD DO TO PREPARE YOURSELF

02:01:13.266 --> 02:01:16.569 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN JUST THE BSA IN THE

02:01:14.901 --> 02:01:18.505 region:rollup2
THE SFU.

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:20.039 region:rollup2
NOW YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION

02:01:18.505 --> 02:01:21.341 region:rollup2
AS SORT OF AN ALTERNATIVE TO

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:22.642 region:rollup2
BUILDING UP THE RESERVE OTHER

02:01:21.341 --> 02:01:24.144 region:rollup2
OTHER SMART THINGS THAT WE COULD

02:01:22.642 --> 02:01:25.745 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE MONEY SUCH AS.

02:01:24.144 --> 02:01:27.413 region:rollup2
PAYING OFF SOME THOSE DEBTS YET

02:01:25.745 --> 02:01:28.515 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S AND ALSO A SMART

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:30.016 region:rollup2
THING TO DO.

02:01:28.515 --> 02:01:31.518 region:rollup2
YOU GET THE RETURN AT THIS

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:33.052 region:rollup2
SEVEN PERCENT AND YOU KNOW YOU

02:01:31.518 --> 02:01:34.487 region:rollup2
PAY OFF THESE DEBTS FASTER THAT

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:35.822 region:rollup2
ALSO PUTS YOU IN A BETTER

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:36.890 region:rollup2
POSITION DOWN THE ROAD.

02:01:35.822 --> 02:01:39.225 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW HOW TO

02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:39.993 region:rollup2
HOW TO BALANCE THOSE.

02:01:39.225 --> 02:01:42.562 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER I THINK

02:01:39.993 --> 02:01:43.429 region:rollup2
TO QUESTION.

02:01:42.562 --> 02:01:45.431 region:rollup2

TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:19.933 region:rollup2
YEAR WE'VE VETS SURPLUSES.

02:02:17.931 --> 02:02:23.937 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA FIRST CHARTS.

02:02:26.639 --> 02:02:28.708 region:rollup2
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE LAST

02:02:27.774 --> 02:02:30.009 region:rollup2
TIME BUT LET ME LOOK LIKE FIRST

02:02:28.708 --> 02:02:32.078 region:rollup2
CHART THE LAST HER ACTUALLY

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:33.980 region:rollup2
SHOWS OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:36.349 region:rollup2
BUDGET IN JANUARY WHAT WE'RE

02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:37.517 region:rollup2
PROJECTING FOR BALANCE VERSUS

02:02:36.349 --> 02:02:39.719 region:rollup2
DEFICIT.

02:02:37.517 --> 02:02:41.254 region:rollup2
ON THAT WAS THAT THE BLACK BARS

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:43.289 region:rollup2
IN THE RED BARS ON THE CHARGES

02:02:41.254 --> 02:02:45.425 region:rollup2
THAT THE CHART YOU'RE REFERRING

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:48.027 region:rollup2
TO I SAW A CHART THAT SHOWS.

02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:49.562 region:rollup2
THAT SAID FOR CERTAIN TIME.

02:02:48.027 --> 02:02:54.801 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SURPLUSES.

02:02:49.562 --> 02:02:56.569 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET.

02:02:54.801 --> 02:02:57.170 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA START JUST PUT

02:02:56.569 --> 02:03:00.807 region:rollup2
COMPETE COULD CAN LOOK AT THAT

02:02:57.170 --> 02:03:02.008 region:rollup2
CHART BACK UP.

02:03:00.807 --> 02:03:03.076 region:rollup2
THIS WAS THE ONE I WAS

02:03:02.008 --> 02:03:06.346 region:rollup2
REFERENCING BUT I DON'T THAT I

02:03:03.076 --> 02:03:07.780 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK GROUND FUNDS.

02:03:06.346 --> 02:03:10.683 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A RECESSION SCENARIO

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:13.586 region:rollup2
CHARRING.

02:03:10.683 --> 02:03:17.824 region:rollup2
OR WILL IT PROP NINETY EIGHT.

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:19.692 region:rollup2
NO SCHOOL FOR.

02:03:17.824 --> 02:03:21.895 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S IT BAT.

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:23.396 region:rollup2
AND.

02:03:21.895 --> 02:03:26.332 region:rollup2
THIS IS ACTUALLY OUR RECESSION

02:03:23.396 --> 02:03:28.668 region:rollup2
SONORA RIGHT BUT YOU YOU SHOWED.

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:30.136 region:rollup2
BIG IS THE YELLOW LINE.

02:03:28.668 --> 02:03:32.338 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET WAS

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:32.905 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE OF THE SURPLUS AND

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:34.274 region:rollup2
WE HAD A SURPLUS SINCE THAT

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:36.242 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:03:34.274 --> 02:03:36.809 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SURPLUS RIGHT NOW AND

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:39.345 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR FORECAST CHINESE

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:40.480 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:43.182 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN HAVING STEADY

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:46.119 region:rollup2
SURPLUSES SINCE WHEN WE'VE IT I

02:03:43.182 --> 02:03:47.887 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAD RECESSION.

02:03:46.119 --> 02:03:49.889 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A STEADY SURPLUS.

02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:51.624 region:rollup2
LET ME DO IT ANOTHER WAY.

02:03:49.889 --> 02:03:53.426 region:rollup2
I GOT ELECTED IN TWENTY TWELVE.

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:54.627 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR

02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:55.695 region:rollup2
IT'S MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:56.229 region:rollup2
BEEN ELECTED IN TWENTY TWO YEAR

02:03:55.695 --> 02:03:58.531 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE.

02:03:56.229 --> 02:04:00.400 region:rollup2
ONE.

02:03:58.531 --> 02:04:02.035 region:rollup2
MOST OF US ALL OF US GOT TWELVE

02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.970 region:rollup2
YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX.

02:04:02.035 --> 02:04:05.305 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A STEADY

02:04:03.970 --> 02:04:08.708 region:rollup2
S. AUTOMATICALLY THAT.

02:04:05.305 --> 02:04:09.709 region:rollup2
SURPLUS IS THAT RIGHT OR WRONG.

02:04:08.708 --> 02:04:11.177 region:rollup2
COURTESY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:11.911 region:rollup2
FINANCE AND THAT'S CORRECT SINCE

02:04:11.177 --> 02:04:13.813 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:14.948 region:rollup2
THIS SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:16.249 region:rollup2
WAS THE FIRST HOUR WE HAD TO

02:04:14.948 --> 02:04:17.383 region:rollup2
LOOK FOR IS THE SOLUTIONS.

THANK YOU.

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:22.956 region:rollup2
NO I.

02:04:22.355 --> 02:04:24.324 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING ELSE

02:04:22.956 --> 02:04:26.459 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:04:24.324 --> 02:04:28.261 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME I KNOW WE'VE WE

02:04:26.459 --> 02:04:29.295 region:rollup2
MAKING SOME PRUDENT DECISION

02:04:28.261 --> 02:04:33.032 region:rollup2
SINCE THEN.

02:04:29.295 --> 02:04:33.967 region:rollup2
TO TO ENSURE FOR THE NEXT.

02:04:33.032 --> 02:04:35.902 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT SHORTFALL A

02:04:33.967 --> 02:04:37.603 region:rollup2
RECESSION.

02:04:35.902 --> 02:04:38.771 region:rollup2
I WAS GONNA GO THERE AND SAY

02:04:37.603 --> 02:04:39.906 region:rollup2
SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED WE HAD

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.640 region:rollup2
NOTHING BUT GOOD BUDGET BUT YOU

02:04:39.906 --> 02:04:42.842 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT JUST ME.

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.476 region:rollup2
.

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:45.878 region:rollup2
BUT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE

02:04:43.476 --> 02:04:47.013 region:rollup2
HERE IS.

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:48.414 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE'RE EXPECTING GLOOM AND

02:04:47.013 --> 02:04:50.450 region:rollup2
DOOM.

02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:53.386 region:rollup2
BUT I I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:54.988 region:rollup2
RIGHT LET'S NOT.

02:04:53.386 --> 02:04:56.589 region:rollup2
MISTAKEN IN THIS IS IS THE FACT

02:04:54.988 --> 02:04:59.625 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:04:56.589 --> 02:05:00.159 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD STEADY INCREASES AND

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:01.260 region:rollup2
AS SOME MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:02.962 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT.

TWELVE YEAR MEMBERS.

02:05:16.576 --> 02:05:19.212 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS MORE LIKELY WE

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:20.947 region:rollup2
WILL BE HERE.

02:05:19.212 --> 02:05:22.682 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME IF IT EVER

02:05:20.947 --> 02:05:23.149 region:rollup2

STATEMENTS ONLY YOU CAN ANSWER

02:05:37.697 --> 02:05:40.533 region:rollup2

BUDGET I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:05.191 region:rollup2
CRITICISM. OR DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:06.692 region:rollup2

02:06:08.461 --> 02:06:12.465 region:rollup2
THE MONIES THAT WE HAVE NOT

02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:13.966 region:rollup2

02:06:12.465 --> 02:06:15.401 region:rollup2
I'VE MET I'VE OF ASSEMBLY

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:16.803 region:rollup2

PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:06:18.204 --> 02:06:21.974 region:rollup2
I'M REALLY CONCERNED ESPECIALLY

02:06:20.106 --> 02:06:25.044 region:rollup2
AFTER TALKING WITH THEM.

02:06:21.974 --> 02:06:26.279 region:rollup2
CDC SEE OUR. ANNA CCPOA IN A

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:27.814 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ABOUT HOW

02:06:26.279 --> 02:06:30.516 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE

02:06:27.814 --> 02:06:32.652 region:rollup2
THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS.

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:34.954 region:rollup2
THERE WE HAVE BOTH INSIDE AND

02:06:32.652 --> 02:06:36.722 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF CDC ARE HOW EFFECTIVE

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:38.324 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY ARE NOT PLANTED.

02:06:36.722 --> 02:06:40.226 region:rollup2
TO S. AN AUDIT OF ALL CDC OUR

02:06:38.324 --> 02:06:41.928 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:06:40.226 --> 02:06:43.496 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS

02:06:41.928 --> 02:06:44.030 region:rollup2
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I

02:06:43.496 --> 02:06:45.097 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:47.266 region:rollup2
PROPOSING FOR GRANTS FOR

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:48.734 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION.

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:50.803 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY GREAT THAT WE'RE

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:52.472 region:rollup2
PUTTING MONEY TOWARDS THAT BUT I

02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:54.440 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE.

02:06:52.472 --> 02:06:56.008 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON EVEN MORE SO IS HOW

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:58.945 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE

02:06:56.008 --> 02:07:00.947 region:rollup2
AS MY. COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE

02:06:58.945 --> 02:07:02.648 region:rollup2
LIKES TO SAY.

02:07:00.947 --> 02:07:04.350 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN CDC

02:07:02.648 --> 02:07:06.385 region:rollup2
ARE LIKE ROCK CLIMBING.

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:07.854 region:rollup2
I DON'T OF ROCK CLIMBING.

02:07:06.385 --> 02:07:09.689 region:rollup2
IS AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE WAY

02:07:07.854 --> 02:07:10.990 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO USE THE MONEY.

02:07:09.689 --> 02:07:12.892 region:rollup2
AND QUITE FRANKLY I'M JUST NOT

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:15.695 region:rollup2
CRITICISM ON IF THERE IS A ROCK

02:07:12.892 --> 02:07:17.430 region:rollup2
FRANK CLIMBING CLASSES SINCE IN.

02:07:15.695 --> 02:07:19.031 region:rollup2
AND OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES

02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:21.400 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CRITICIZING IT I JUST

02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:23.469 region:rollup2
WANT TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:24.036 region:rollup2
THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

02:07:23.469 --> 02:07:25.738 region:rollup2
AND THEY DO HELP TO REDUCE

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:27.740 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:29.475 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ON THE BACK END AS WE

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:31.878 region:rollup2
START TALKING ABOUT HOW

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:33.613 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY WE UTILIZE. OUR OUR

02:07:31.878 --> 02:07:35.381 region:rollup2
PRISONS WHETHER WE CLOSE THEM.

02:07:33.613 --> 02:07:37.383 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER WE

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:39.218 region:rollup2
TRANSFER THEM TO BECOME MEDICAL

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:41.087 region:rollup2
FACILITIES INSTEAD OF CLOSING

02:07:39.218 --> 02:07:42.388 region:rollup2
THEM OR.

02:07:41.087 --> 02:07:44.857 region:rollup2
OR REHABILITATION FACILITIES

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:46.392 region:rollup2
STEAD OF CLOSING THEM.

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:48.394 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION I

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:49.996 region:rollup2
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO MOVE

02:07:48.394 --> 02:07:52.098 region:rollup2
INTO THAT AREA.

02:07:49.996 --> 02:07:53.633 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ARE IN

02:07:52.098 --> 02:07:56.936 region:rollup2
THE BENCHMARKS THAT WE SET UP

02:07:53.633 --> 02:07:58.504 region:rollup2
FOR. OUR ARE EFFECTIVE AND SO MY

02:07:56.936 --> 02:08:00.439 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS DO THESE.

02:07:58.504 --> 02:08:02.542 region:rollup2

AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHAT THE

02:08:07.947 --> 02:08:11.751 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS OF OF OF AUDIT SHOULD

02:08:09.815 --> 02:08:13.286 region:rollup2
BE SAID YOU COULD BETTER.

02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:15.254 region:rollup2

WE WELCOME THE DISCUSSION A

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.829 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY I WAS SLIGHTLY

02:08:22.662 --> 02:08:25.531 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN AN AUDIT THAT WE

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:28.234 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:29.268 region:rollup2

TO YOUR POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:08:38.344 --> 02:08:41.914 region:rollup2
THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING

02:08:39.679 --> 02:08:42.982 region:rollup2
UTILIZED EFFECTIVELY. AND SO WE

THAT DURING BAD BUDGET TIMES WE

02:09:00.1000 --> 02:09:04.036 region:rollup2
JUST IGNORE AND HOPE THAT THE

02:09:02.702 --> 02:09:06.505 region:rollup2
BUILDING DOESN'T FALL DOWN

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:09.208 region:rollup2

02:09:33.099 --> 02:09:35.868 region:rollup2
WOULD LOVE TO BE INVOLVED. IN

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:38.504 region:rollup2
THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE

IF WE'RE EFFECTIVE ON A

02:10:28.888 --> 02:10:32.958 region:rollup2
REHABILITATION PROGRAM WE CAN

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:34.794 region:rollup2
CLOSE THAT AND PROBABLY REDUCE

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:36.929 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER DOWN. ON

02:10:45.371 --> 02:10:47.406 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT IS OPERATING.

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:48.941 region:rollup2
SINCE THEY HAVE SOME MORE MONEY

02:10:47.406 --> 02:10:50.576 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:10:48.941 --> 02:10:52.511 region:rollup2
ARE THEY EVIDENCE BASED HAVE

THEY BEEN SHOWN TO WORK.

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:55.281 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S JUST A NECESSARY BUT

02:10:53.646 --> 02:10:55.848 region:rollup2
NOT SUFFICIENT THEY HAVE TO MAKE

02:10:55.281 --> 02:10:56.515 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING

02:10:55.848 --> 02:10:59.218 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:59.819 region:rollup2
IN WAYS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL YOU

02:10:59.218 --> 02:11:01.320 region:rollup2
CAN'T JUST SAY YOU'RE RUNNING

02:10:59.819 --> 02:11:02.655 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM. BUT THE METRIC

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.657 region:rollup2
SEVENTH SO WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO

REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ALAS.

02:11:14.834 --> 02:11:19.138 region:rollup2
SO IF SOMEONE STAYS OUT FOR YEAR

02:11:17.136 --> 02:11:21.107 region:rollup2
DEBTS WE USE TO BE SIXTY FIVE

02:11:19.138 --> 02:11:22.908 region:rollup2
THOUSAND THAT WAS SAFE BY THINGS

02:11:21.107 --> 02:11:23.876 region:rollup2
UP EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND OR MORE

02:11:22.908 --> 02:11:25.845 region:rollup2
THAT WE SPEND ON PEOPLE

02:11:23.876 --> 02:11:27.313 region:rollup2

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:32.218 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WILL TELL ME NO WE

CAN'T.

02:11:32.218 --> 02:11:34.653 region:rollup2
AND THEY'LL TELL THEM WHAT THEY

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:37.323 region:rollup2

SO ONCE YOU GO AND CHECK.

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:45.564 region:rollup2

FORMER LEE INCARCERATED ARE NOW

02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:54.840 region:rollup2
LONG LONGER CAMINO CRAP THAT'S A

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:56.542 region:rollup2
SAVINGS TO BATTLING TO TO THE

02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:57.309 region:rollup2

I KNOW WE COULD DO THAT.

02:12:02.515 --> 02:12:05.551 region:rollup2
SO DO ALSO SOME REALLY EASY WAYS

WE CAN.

02:12:05.551 --> 02:12:09.488 region:rollup2

TO REITERATE TO SOME OF THE.

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:51.096 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES MADE

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:52.631 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE COURT'S EARLIER ON IN

02:12:51.096 --> 02:12:54.633 region:rollup2
OUR DISCUSSION AND.

02:12:52.631 --> 02:12:57.236 region:rollup2
I.

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:59.104 region:rollup2
AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE

02:12:57.236 --> 02:13:00.773 region:rollup2
COURTS COMPARED TO OTHER

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:02.942 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE ARE

02:13:00.773 --> 02:13:05.578 region:rollup2
LAGGING FAR BEHIND. IN

02:13:02.942 --> 02:13:07.813 region:rollup2
RESTORATION OF FUNDING IF YOU

02:13:05.578 --> 02:13:09.081 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. EVEN CONSIDERING A LOT

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.448 region:rollup2
OF THE REFORMS THAT HAVE TAKEN

02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:11.350 region:rollup2
PLACE IN THE.

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:13.385 region:rollup2
MEANTIME BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:14.653 region:rollup2
AT THE BASELINE FUNDING THAT

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:17.156 region:rollup2
EXISTED.

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:18.457 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THE RECESSION HIT

02:13:17.156 --> 02:13:20.259 region:rollup2
THE CONDITION OF THE COURTS WERE

02:13:18.457 --> 02:13:22.595 region:rollup2
AND WHICH WAS GREAT THEN.

02:13:20.259 --> 02:13:24.296 region:rollup2
COMPARED TOHOW WE'VE RESTORED

02:13:22.595 --> 02:13:26.966 region:rollup2
MONEY AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:28.634 region:rollup2
THERE IS MORE MONEY THIS YEAR IN

02:13:26.966 --> 02:13:30.102 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET THAN PAST YEARS. BUT

02:13:28.634 --> 02:13:31.203 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:34.006 region:rollup2
ASSESS

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:36.242 region:rollup2
HOW FAR ALONG WE ARE IN

02:13:34.006 --> 02:13:39.311 region:rollup2
RESTORING THE COURTS TO WHERE

02:13:36.242 --> 02:13:40.546 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE. AUTUMN AND I'M.

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:42.915 region:rollup2
WONDERING IF I.

02:13:40.546 --> 02:13:43.482 region:rollup2
YOUR DEPARTMENT CAN SHED TO

02:13:42.915 --> 02:13:44.884 region:rollup2
EITHER YOU CAN SHED LIGHT ON

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:46.685 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:13:44.884 --> 02:13:48.254 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT ARE ALSO ON THE

02:13:46.685 --> 02:13:50.689 region:rollup2
COURTS WHEN IT COMES TO

02:13:48.254 --> 02:13:52.224 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE I WAS STRUCK BY

02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:55.060 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE

02:13:52.224 --> 02:13:56.195 region:rollup2
FROM SALINAS ABOUT A COURT THAT

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:57.062 region:rollup2
SHE KNOWS IN THAT I'VE HEARD

02:13:56.195 --> 02:13:59.965 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS A MEMBER OF THE

02:13:57.062 --> 02:14:02.801 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. ACCORD THAT.

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:04.470 region:rollup2
NEEDS WORK AND ISN'T EVEN ON

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:08.574 region:rollup2
THE LIST OF SEVENTEEN COURTS

02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:09.708 region:rollup2
THAT IS SLATED FOR FUNDING OVER.

02:14:08.574 --> 02:14:12.511 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY SOUNDS LIKE OVER THE

02:14:09.708 --> 02:14:13.946 region:rollup2
NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OR SO.

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:15.781 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT CONCERNS ME BECAUSE

02:14:13.946 --> 02:14:17.850 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR.

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:20.219 region:rollup2
COURTS

02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:23.289 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN STRAPPED FOR A.

02:14:20.219 --> 02:14:24.924 region:rollup2
I CASH THAT THEY NEED TO DO

02:14:23.289 --> 02:14:27.259 region:rollup2
ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND THINGS

02:14:24.924 --> 02:14:29.228 region:rollup2
OF THAT NATURE.

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:30.663 region:rollup2
AND AND TO IN MANY CASES THE

02:14:29.228 --> 02:14:32.731 region:rollup2
COURTS ARE LITERALLY HELD

02:14:30.663 --> 02:14:33.933 region:rollup2
TOGETHER BY BAILING WIRE AND AND

02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:36.402 region:rollup2
THAT DUCT TAPE TO EVER.

02:14:33.933 --> 02:14:38.137 region:rollup2
ISN'T ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THE

02:14:36.402 --> 02:14:39.405 region:rollup2
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN OUR

02:14:38.137 --> 02:14:43.475 region:rollup2
COURT SYSTEM SOMEONE OR IF YOU

02:14:39.405 --> 02:14:45.244 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY COMMENTS.

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:46.178 region:rollup2
THINK ANY MAJOR ARRESTS AND

02:14:45.244 --> 02:14:47.913 region:rollup2
WHATSOEVER TO FINANCE A THINK

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:49.949 region:rollup2
AND JUST AS THE COMPARISON POINT

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:51.216 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT WERE NOT AT THE LEVEL

02:14:49.949 --> 02:14:53.485 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE FULLY REFUNDED OUT IN

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:54.820 region:rollup2
PRIOR YEARS I'M. GOING BACK TO

02:14:53.485 --> 02:14:56.822 region:rollup2
SEVEN EIGHT WE WERE OUR TRIAL

02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:59.091 region:rollup2
COURTS REFUNDED ABOUT AND THREE

02:14:56.822 --> 02:15:00.592 region:rollup2
POINT THREE MILLION AND WERE NOW

02:14:59.091 --> 02:15:02.227 region:rollup2
I'M JUST UNDER THREE MILLION IN

02:15:00.592 --> 02:15:03.262 region:rollup2
OUR PROPOSED BUDGET. I AM I

02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:04.663 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT WERE NECESSARILY

02:15:03.262 --> 02:15:06.298 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET BACK TO A CERTAIN

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:07.433 region:rollup2
LEVEL BUT TRYING TO MAKE

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:08.867 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE

02:15:07.433 --> 02:15:15.641 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD IN CASE THAT THAT'S

02:15:08.867 --> 02:15:18.477 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE COURTS AND NOW. I AM

02:15:15.641 --> 02:15:19.712 region:rollup2
GOING TO START WITH GILLIAN.

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:20.746 region:rollup2
ASSUME THAT WAS A SLIGHT MISTAKE

02:15:19.712 --> 02:15:21.280 region:rollup2
I APOLOGIZE I ASSUME THE

02:15:20.746 --> 02:15:22.848 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD IS ONLY INCURS.

02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:23.682 region:rollup2
THAT BE CORRECT.

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:24.883 region:rollup2
I THINK SO I MEAN THERE HAS

02:15:23.682 --> 02:15:25.517 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY BEEN CHANGES BETWEEN

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.018 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IN THE

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:26.852 region:rollup2
DATA WITH IN FRONT OF ME

02:15:26.018 --> 02:15:29.054 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:30.656 region:rollup2
AND I CRIMINAL CASE FILENE'S ON

02:15:29.054 --> 02:15:31.824 region:rollup2
CIVIL CASE EILEEN'S I'M ALL OF

02:15:30.656 --> 02:15:33.425 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS CERTAINLY HAVE

02:15:31.824 --> 02:15:35.194 region:rollup2
CHANGED OVER TIME AND THAT IT'S

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:37.429 region:rollup2
SOME DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY

02:15:35.194 --> 02:15:38.597 region:rollup2
AND ACCESS TO COURT SERVICES.

02:15:37.429 --> 02:15:40.299 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT MORE SELF

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:41.600 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED LIBERTY LITIGANTS IN

02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:42.668 region:rollup2
THE COURT SYSTEM NOW WHICH WE'VE

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.702 region:rollup2
MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN

02:15:42.668 --> 02:15:45.504 region:rollup2
THAT AREA TO TRY TO HELP THOSE

02:15:43.702 --> 02:15:46.905 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS. THAT OTHERWISE

02:15:45.504 --> 02:15:48.507 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO GET.

02:15:46.905 --> 02:15:50.209 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE COURTS

02:15:48.507 --> 02:15:51.777 region:rollup2
SO RECOGNIZING THAT WERE WERE

02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:54.380 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE STRIDES IN THIS

02:15:51.777 --> 02:15:56.548 region:rollup2
AREA BUT. AREN'T NECESSARILY.

02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:58.550 region:rollup2
AIMING TO GET BACK TO A CERTAIN

02:15:56.548 --> 02:16:00.619 region:rollup2
FUNDING LEVEL I WANT TO COMMEND

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.854 region:rollup2
YOU ON A PROVIDING MORE FUNDING

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:03.655 region:rollup2
FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS

02:16:01.854 --> 02:16:05.157 region:rollup2
IT IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.925 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT.

02:16:05.157 --> 02:16:09.228 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:16:06.925 --> 02:16:10.896 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THAT HELP IS ONLY ONE

02:16:09.228 --> 02:16:14.333 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE.

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:16.702 region:rollup2
OF OF THE OF THE PUZZLE IF A

02:16:14.333 --> 02:16:18.537 region:rollup2
SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS.

02:16:16.702 --> 02:16:21.040 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET A COURT DATE AND HAS

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:23.575 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK NUMEROUS TIMES IN

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:25.310 region:rollup2
ORDER TO HAVE. A IS A HER ISSUE

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:27.579 region:rollup2
RESOLVED.

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:28.514 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DOING A THEM A

02:16:27.579 --> 02:16:30.482 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

02:16:28.514 --> 02:16:32.117 region:rollup2
A SELFLESS REPRESENT LITIGANTS

02:16:30.482 --> 02:16:33.619 region:rollup2
ARE TYPICALLY PORT THAT'S WHY

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:35.254 region:rollup2
THEIR SELF REPRESENTED.

02:16:33.619 --> 02:16:36.889 region:rollup2
THEIR LOSING TIME FROM WORK OUT

02:16:35.254 --> 02:16:38.390 region:rollup2
OF THEIR SCHEDULES THEY'RE

02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:40.392 region:rollup2
HAVING TO TRAVEL.

02:16:38.390 --> 02:16:41.860 region:rollup2
LONGER DISTANCES THAN THEY DID

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:45.197 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE CLOSE SO

02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:46.899 region:rollup2
MANY COURTHOUSES AND SO I I DO

02:16:45.197 --> 02:16:48.934 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO BE.

02:16:46.899 --> 02:16:51.570 region:rollup2
ASSESSING.

02:16:48.934 --> 02:16:53.505 region:rollup2
WHAT OUR PLAN IS FOR RESTORING

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:56.241 region:rollup2
THE COURTS TO THE PLACE THAT

02:16:53.505 --> 02:16:57.976 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO BE NOW THE? COURTS

02:16:56.241 --> 02:17:00.312 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE THAT OF SO THE

02:16:57.976 --> 02:17:02.214 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.

02:17:00.312 --> 02:17:04.216 region:rollup2
AS A LEGISLATURE AND IN THE

02:17:02.214 --> 02:17:04.483 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH TO ADDRESS

02:17:04.216 --> 02:17:06.518 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES

02:17:04.483 --> 02:17:07.686 region:rollup2
I JUST.

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:09.388 region:rollup2
LEAVE YOU WITH WITHOUT THAT I

02:17:07.686 --> 02:17:11.824 region:rollup2
THINK VERY IMPORTANT.

02:17:09.388 --> 02:17:13.392 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON THE SECOND QUESTION

02:17:11.824 --> 02:17:15.794 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO ASK AND.

02:17:13.392 --> 02:17:17.896 region:rollup2
I SUPPOSE IT'S A IN THE IN THE

02:17:15.794 --> 02:17:19.898 region:rollup2
NATURE OF A BOTH A COMMENT AND A

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:21.100 region:rollup2
AND A QUESTION. OF HAS TO DO

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:22.668 region:rollup2
WITH THE EARLIER DISCUSSION

02:17:21.100 --> 02:17:22.668 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:17:23.402 --> 02:17:23.769 region:rollup2
THE.

02:17:23.836 --> 02:17:29.374 region:rollup2
A RAINY DAY FUND AND AND AND

02:17:27.106 --> 02:17:30.008 region:rollup2
AND THE RESERVE. AND I THINK

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:33.378 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:17:30.008 --> 02:17:35.314 region:rollup2
FOR FOR MOST MEMBERS WE

02:17:33.378 --> 02:17:36.215 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A GOOD

02:17:35.314 --> 02:17:37.082 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE'RE DOING IN A

02:17:36.215 --> 02:17:38.984 region:rollup2
NECESSARY THING TO PROTECT

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:40.018 region:rollup2
AGAINST.

02:17:38.984 --> 02:17:44.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT BUT

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:45.124 region:rollup2
WHAT. IS LEFT AND SAID HERE.

02:17:44.123 --> 02:17:47.760 region:rollup2
WHICH TOUCHED ON IS THE

02:17:45.124 --> 02:17:49.895 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY OF OUR REVENUE

02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:52.231 region:rollup2
STREAMS AND WHAT IS LEFT UNSAID

02:17:49.895 --> 02:17:54.333 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS

02:17:52.231 --> 02:17:56.468 region:rollup2
THAT VOLATILITY. IN THE FORM OF

02:17:54.333 --> 02:17:58.804 region:rollup2
TAX REFORM.

02:17:56.468 --> 02:18:01.373 region:rollup2
OUR OUR OUR REVENUE STREAMS ARE

02:17:58.804 --> 02:18:03.775 region:rollup2
VOLATILE IN PART.

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:04.910 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE RELY ON AN ANTIQUATED

02:18:03.775 --> 02:18:07.045 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:08.847 region:rollup2
APPROVE OF OF REVENUE GENERATION

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:10.449 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE

02:18:08.847 --> 02:18:12.117 region:rollup2
GENERATIONS AGO BUT WE'VE DONE

02:18:10.449 --> 02:18:12.885 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO TAKE CORRECTIVE

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:15.220 region:rollup2
ACTION.

A SEAT NEED FOR THAT KIND OF

02:18:31.703 --> 02:18:36.542 region:rollup2
REFORM BUT THAT IT IS GOING TO

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:39.344 region:rollup2
TAKE LEADERSHIP FROM THE. TOP TO

02:18:36.542 --> 02:18:40.879 region:rollup2

BEEN RAISED TO.

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:58.156 region:rollup2
WHEN THE GOVERNOR US.

WHETHER IT IS SEE THE ONE NO.

02:20:02.728 --> 02:20:06.465 region:rollup2
BY HIMSELF LA SETTING THE PRES

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:08.967 region:rollup2
BOROUGH HALL TO SUPPRESS WOULD

02:20:06.465 --> 02:20:13.372 region:rollup2
BE HANDLED OR.

02:20:08.967 --> 02:20:17.409 region:rollup2

MAKES SUGGESTIONS.

02:20:18.744 --> 02:20:22.381 region:rollup2
.

02:20:20.779 --> 02:20:25.517 region:rollup2
THE THOUGHT DOESN'T JUST MAIS

02:20:22.381 --> 02:20:27.252 region:rollup2
GENERAL CURIOSITY HOW.

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:29.288 region:rollup2
WHAT WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANY

02:20:27.252 --> 02:20:30.522 region:rollup2

SPEND THAT ANYWHERE.

02:20:34.026 --> 02:20:37.529 region:rollup2
BUT THE MY THINKING IS THAT

02:20:34.593 --> 02:20:39.498 region:rollup2
TERM.

02:20:37.529 --> 02:20:41.800 region:rollup2
AND SINCE WE HAVE.

02:20:39.498 --> 02:20:44.903 region:rollup2

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:44.903 region:rollup2
THREE WAY SO MAYBE WE CAN THINK

02:20:44.970 --> 02:20:48.206 region:rollup2
WAY IS SO OBVIOUSLY.

02:20:46.705 --> 02:20:49.608 region:rollup2
.

02:20:48.206 --> 02:20:51.510 region:rollup2

THAT IN CASE OF THAT DOWN WE ARE

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:57.743 region:rollup2

CANNOT. DENY THAT NGUYEN

02:22:07.052 --> 02:22:11.023 region:rollup2
INDEFINITELY CONTINUE. BUT THE

02:22:09.087 --> 02:22:14.493 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION CAN BE ONE TIME NON

02:22:11.023 --> 02:22:18.330 region:rollup2

02:23:12.784 --> 02:23:14.953 region:rollup2
WE'VE OBVIOUSLY GIVING YOUR OUR

02:23:14.086 --> 02:23:16.588 region:rollup2
BUDGET PROPOSAL YOUR SUB

02:23:14.953 --> 02:23:18.090 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES WILL MEET AND CONFER

02:23:16.588 --> 02:23:19.658 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU AGREE

02:23:18.090 --> 02:23:21.660 region:rollup2
WITH OUR PRINCIPLES AS WE.

02:23:19.658 --> 02:23:23.061 region:rollup2
MOVE TOWARDS THE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:24.496 region:rollup2
DEADLINE OF PASSING THE BUDGET

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:25.797 region:rollup2
ON JUNE FIFTEENTH.

02:23:24.496 --> 02:23:27.099 region:rollup2
I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THE

02:23:25.797 --> 02:23:29.534 region:rollup2
ARCHITECTURE OF THE GOVERNOR'S

02:23:27.099 --> 02:23:31.169 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BUDGET IS BASED ON.

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:32.404 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE SURPLUS YOU TO

02:23:31.169 --> 02:23:34.473 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE NATURE OF THE

02:23:32.404 --> 02:23:35.006 region:rollup2
SURPLUS AND MUCH DRIVING IT EONS

02:23:34.473 --> 02:23:37.075 region:rollup2
ON TO THE ANALYST EARLIER

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:38.410 region:rollup2
POINTS.

02:23:37.075 --> 02:23:39.945 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A POINT IN

02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:40.979 region:rollup2
TIME WHEN WE HAVE TO PUT THE

02:23:39.945 --> 02:23:42.013 region:rollup2
BUDGET TOGETHER TO ACTUALLY

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:43.648 region:rollup2
LITERALLY SEND IT TO THE

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:45.450 region:rollup2
PRINTING PRESS AND WE'RE STILL

02:23:43.648 --> 02:23:46.685 region:rollup2
GATHERING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:23:45.450 --> 02:23:48.019 region:rollup2
THE NATURE OF REVENUES AND WHILE

02:23:46.685 --> 02:23:49.187 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMING AND HIGHER BUT WE

02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:50.689 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF ITS ASSOCIATED

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:51.823 region:rollup2
WITH THE. PERSONAL INCOME TAX

02:23:50.689 --> 02:23:53.291 region:rollup2
AND CAP GAINS.

02:23:51.823 --> 02:23:55.660 region:rollup2
THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:56.962 region:rollup2
ITS ONGOING SURPLUS OR FITS ONE

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:58.363 region:rollup2
TIME IN NATURE AND IN OUR

02:23:56.962 --> 02:23:59.931 region:rollup2
ESTIMATION WE ARE PUTTING

02:23:58.363 --> 02:24:01.566 region:rollup2
TOGETHER THIS DOCUMENT WAS

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:03.401 region:rollup2
REALLY ONE TIME THE NATURE. AND

02:24:01.566 --> 02:24:03.635 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY OUR PRINCIPLES ARE

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:04.970 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:24:03.635 --> 02:24:06.238 region:rollup2
.

02:24:04.970 --> 02:24:08.039 region:rollup2
PRUDENT IN BUILDING UP THE

02:24:06.238 --> 02:24:09.541 region:rollup2
RESERVE IS WELL AS LIMITING MANY

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:13.778 region:rollup2
OF OUR EXPENDITURES TO THOSE

02:24:09.541 --> 02:24:14.079 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE.

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:16.448 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF.

02:24:14.079 --> 02:24:18.350 region:rollup2
.

02:24:16.448 --> 02:24:21.153 region:rollup2
IS SURPLUS IS OBVIOUSLY

02:24:18.350 --> 02:24:23.555 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR REVENUE.

02:24:21.153 --> 02:24:23.755 region:rollup2
YOUR PAST RECORD THAT. I SEE IS

02:24:23.555 --> 02:24:25.323 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:24:23.755 --> 02:24:28.093 region:rollup2
.

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:32.364 region:rollup2
NOT GENERAL FUND SPENDING HAS

02:24:28.093 --> 02:24:33.565 region:rollup2
GROWN. AT THE NEARLY THREE TIMES

02:24:32.364 --> 02:24:36.134 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF INFLATION IN

02:24:33.565 --> 02:24:38.236 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:40.705 region:rollup2
SOURCE SINCE WE HAVE MONEY LESS

02:24:38.236 --> 02:24:42.974 region:rollup2
SPENDING SO I THINK.

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:46.044 region:rollup2
IF DIAZ STATE BUDGET. HAS GROWN

02:24:42.974 --> 02:24:46.711 region:rollup2
AT THE RATE OF ONLY INFLATION.

02:24:46.044 --> 02:24:48.313 region:rollup2
THE.

02:24:46.711 --> 02:24:49.681 region:rollup2
BUDGET ORDER BEEN.

02:24:48.313 --> 02:24:52.017 region:rollup2
SELECTED OVER ONE HUNDRED

02:24:49.681 --> 02:24:53.618 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS IS UP ARE. A

02:24:52.017 --> 02:24:55.453 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE BILLION

02:24:53.618 --> 02:24:56.421 region:rollup2
DOLLARS

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:57.022 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT THERE WE COULD HAVE

02:24:56.421 --> 02:24:57.622 region:rollup2
A SAFE THE THIRTY FIVE BILLION

02:24:57.022 --> 02:24:58.924 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:24:57.622 --> 02:25:00.559 region:rollup2
SO WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE

02:24:58.924 --> 02:25:01.693 region:rollup2
EXPERTS EIGHT EXPENDITURE AWAY

02:25:00.559 --> 02:25:05.063 region:rollup2
OR FOR AWHILE.

02:25:01.693 --> 02:25:06.164 region:rollup2
INFLATION RATE.

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:08.200 region:rollup2
I THINK WHEN THE ANALYST

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:09.601 region:rollup2
DEVELOPS THE ONE PAGER ON BUDGET

02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:11.136 region:rollup2
FORMULAS THAT WILL ILLUMINATE

02:25:09.601 --> 02:25:12.537 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT AS SOME OF THIS IS

02:25:11.136 --> 02:25:14.839 region:rollup2
CASELOAD DRIVEN.

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:15.840 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT OF IT IS THAT OUR

02:25:14.839 --> 02:25:16.441 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUR CASELOAD DRIVE AND

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.142 region:rollup2
I AND THE OTHER THING IS THE

02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:19.177 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

02:25:17.142 --> 02:25:21.146 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE OBVIOUSLY AND IT

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:22.514 region:rollup2
DRIVES OFF OF. A COUPLE OF

02:25:21.146 --> 02:25:24.049 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING OUR

02:25:22.514 --> 02:25:25.784 region:rollup2
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND

02:25:24.049 --> 02:25:27.252 region:rollup2
YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH IN

02:25:25.784 --> 02:25:29.354 region:rollup2
REVENUES. SO.

02:25:27.252 --> 02:25:31.723 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS

02:25:29.354 --> 02:25:33.725 region:rollup2
THAT AND HAPPEN ON THE NATURAL

02:25:31.723 --> 02:25:35.227 region:rollup2
AS REVENUES COME IN. AND I THINK

02:25:33.725 --> 02:25:37.062 region:rollup2
THAT ONE PAGE WILL PROVIDE YOU

02:25:35.227 --> 02:25:39.197 region:rollup2
SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON SOME

02:25:37.062 --> 02:25:42.400 region:rollup2
OF THOSE THINGS THAT AND

02:25:39.197 --> 02:25:44.636 region:rollup2
HAPPENED REALLY ON THE NATURAL.

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.870 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

02:25:44.636 --> 02:25:47.105 region:rollup2
SURE I THINK AS MISS COSTA SAID

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.740 region:rollup2
YOU.

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:50.642 region:rollup2
YOU TYPICALLY WILL HAVE TO

02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:51.443 region:rollup2
INCREASE EXPENDITURES FOR

02:25:50.642 --> 02:25:53.979 region:rollup2
INFLATION THEIR PROP NINETY

02:25:51.443 --> 02:25:55.447 region:rollup2
EIGHT FORMULA HAS THAT SORT OF

02:25:53.979 --> 02:25:56.948 region:rollup2
IMPLICITLY BUILT IN ALONG WITH

02:25:55.447 --> 02:25:58.617 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT GROWTH. THE

02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:00.285 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S ALSO MADE YOU KNOW

02:25:58.617 --> 02:26:01.987 region:rollup2
ITS OWN DECISIONS ABOUT

02:26:00.285 --> 02:26:03.054 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT ONE.

02:26:01.987 --> 02:26:05.056 region:rollup2
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES.

02:26:03.054 --> 02:26:07.258 region:rollup2
.

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:10.028 region:rollup2
AFFECTED THE STATE. I DECISIONS

02:26:07.258 --> 02:26:11.496 region:rollup2
TO ADD ADDITIONAL SERVICES OR

02:26:10.028 --> 02:26:13.098 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL HOURS IN.

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:15.500 region:rollup2
AYE H. ASSESS.

02:26:13.098 --> 02:26:17.435 region:rollup2
ADDED MOMENT GROWTH IN YOU SEE

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:18.003 region:rollup2
I MEAN THESE ARE JUST DECISIONS

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:19.004 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE MAKES EVERY

02:26:18.003 --> 02:26:20.238 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:26:19.004 --> 02:26:21.273 region:rollup2
AND IT TENDS TO HAVE SPENDING

02:26:20.238 --> 02:26:22.874 region:rollup2
GROW T AT GREATER THAT

02:26:21.273 --> 02:26:24.676 region:rollup2
INFLATION.

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:26.044 region:rollup2
JUST LOOKING AT THE.

02:26:24.676 --> 02:26:27.512 region:rollup2
THIS IS RELATES TO REALLY MISTER

02:26:26.044 --> 02:26:28.713 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE QUESTION.

02:26:27.512 --> 02:26:30.181 region:rollup2
THE LAST THREE YEARS IT LOOKS

02:26:28.713 --> 02:26:30.715 region:rollup2
LIKE GENERAL FUND SPENDING GREW

02:26:30.181 --> 02:26:32.217 region:rollup2
AT ABOUT ONE PERCENT FOUR

02:26:30.715 --> 02:26:33.485 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:26:32.217 --> 02:26:34.419 region:rollup2
SIX POINT TWO PERCENT AND SELL

02:26:33.485 --> 02:26:35.987 region:rollup2
PROPOSED FOR FOUR POINT ONE

02:26:34.419 --> 02:26:37.922 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:26:35.987 --> 02:26:39.658 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ROUGHLY IN LINE WITH

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:41.326 region:rollup2
YOUR REVENUE GROWTH.

02:26:39.658 --> 02:26:42.227 region:rollup2
SO IT'S JUST YOUR DECISIONS THAT

02:26:41.326 --> 02:26:44.696 region:rollup2
YOU MAKE ABOUT HOW YOU ALLOCATE

02:26:42.227 --> 02:26:46.798 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY.

02:26:44.696 --> 02:26:48.800 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR US OUT A PROPOSED A

02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:50.835 region:rollup2
BUDGET THAT INCLUDES SELF.

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:52.604 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED.

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:54.939 region:rollup2
NEW POLLUTION SAW OUT WITH THE

02:26:52.604 --> 02:26:56.574 region:rollup2
CALTRANS ISSUE WE ARE.

02:26:54.939 --> 02:26:58.209 region:rollup2
HAVE A HEART ABOUT THE.

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:59.344 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE

02:26:58.209 --> 02:27:00.912 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT THE OPERATIONAL

02:26:59.344 --> 02:27:02.047 region:rollup2
CALTRANS.

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:04.082 region:rollup2
NOW IS SO.

02:27:02.047 --> 02:27:05.083 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENCIES OR BECAUSE OF

02:27:04.082 --> 02:27:06.551 region:rollup2
THE PIPE AND YOU EMPLOYEES

02:27:05.083 --> 02:27:08.353 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:11.690 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN STREAMLINING WHILE

02:27:08.353 --> 02:27:13.325 region:rollup2
FINDING SOME. BETTER WAYS OF

02:27:11.690 --> 02:27:14.192 region:rollup2
IMPROVING THE SERVICE SO. THAT

02:27:13.325 --> 02:27:17.529 region:rollup2
THAT THIS HAS SOUGHT JUST

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:19.197 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ADDING ONE TOP OFFER IN.

02:27:17.529 --> 02:27:22.067 region:rollup2
ARE.

02:27:19.197 --> 02:27:24.035 region:rollup2
INEFFICIENT OPERATIONS.

02:27:22.067 --> 02:27:26.271 region:rollup2
I WOULD NOTE TWO POINTS.

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:27.906 region:rollup2
ONE WERE PROPOSING A SIGNIFICANT

02:27:26.271 --> 02:27:29.941 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN SP ONE OF SEVEN

02:27:27.906 --> 02:27:30.709 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS NOT

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:31.343 region:rollup2
SIMPLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

02:27:30.709 --> 02:27:33.378 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

02:27:31.343 --> 02:27:34.846 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER WELLS

02:27:33.378 --> 02:27:37.015 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ALSO WE RECENTLY

02:27:34.846 --> 02:27:39.617 region:rollup2
APPOINTED AN INSPECTOR GENERAL

02:27:37.015 --> 02:27:41.519 region:rollup2
ONTO CALTRANS TO OVERVIEW THESE

02:27:39.617 --> 02:27:43.254 region:rollup2
PROJECT DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT

02:27:41.519 --> 02:27:44.756 region:rollup2
THEY ARE BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY

02:27:43.254 --> 02:27:45.857 region:rollup2
AND EFFECTIVELY.

02:27:44.756 --> 02:27:47.359 region:rollup2
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

02:27:45.857 --> 02:27:48.226 region:rollup2
IS WHEN YOU SPENDING SEVEN POINT

02:27:47.359 --> 02:27:49.728 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:27:48.226 --> 02:27:52.197 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IT DOES

02:27:49.728 --> 02:27:54.032 region:rollup2
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL. ON EMPLOYEES

02:27:52.197 --> 02:27:55.667 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES THAT WE WOULD UTILIZE

02:27:54.032 --> 02:27:57.736 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE BOND FUNDS VERSUS

02:27:55.667 --> 02:28:00.338 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. ON AND SO

02:27:57.736 --> 02:28:01.773 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR. OUR INCREASE STAFF

02:28:00.338 --> 02:28:03.541 region:rollup2
LOAD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:28:01.773 --> 02:28:05.610 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WE THINK WILL BE FUNDED

02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:06.845 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IS THAT THE

02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:08.279 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES A

02:28:06.845 --> 02:28:11.049 region:rollup2
SUCH A PROPOSED THAT BECAUSE

02:28:08.279 --> 02:28:11.416 region:rollup2
SUFFER SP ONE PASSED A

02:28:11.049 --> 02:28:15.720 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

02:28:11.416 --> 02:28:18.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT.

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:20.058 region:rollup2
YOU NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO.

02:28:18.923 --> 02:28:21.659 region:rollup2
BUT ASSEMBLYMAN WE'VE OBVIOUSLY

02:28:20.058 --> 02:28:23.294 region:rollup2
RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CALTRANS

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:24.629 region:rollup2
STAFFING LEVELS IN THE PAST.

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:25.697 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT IT

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:27.465 region:rollup2
IT'S NO QUESTION THAT THEIR WORK

02:28:25.697 --> 02:28:28.466 region:rollup2
LOAD WILL INCREASE.

02:28:27.465 --> 02:28:30.401 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION WAS DID THEY HAVE

02:28:28.466 --> 02:28:32.003 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE ALREADY THAT.

02:28:30.401 --> 02:28:32.604 region:rollup2
COULD HANDLE THIS WORKLOAD SO

02:28:32.003 --> 02:28:36.274 region:rollup2
WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKING A LOOK

02:28:32.604 --> 02:28:37.709 region:rollup2
AT THAT.

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:39.544 region:rollup2
OKAY IF YOU'RE THERE ARE.

02:28:37.709 --> 02:28:40.078 region:rollup2
FINAL IS JUST AS I I I DON'T

02:28:39.544 --> 02:28:42.447 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN.

02:28:40.078 --> 02:28:45.216 region:rollup2
THE FIND ANY SOLUTIONS HERE.

02:28:42.447 --> 02:28:45.717 region:rollup2
I COME FROM US HERE FOR IRVINE

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:47.552 region:rollup2
AND.

02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:48.186 region:rollup2
DOES TOOL TO HELP WHICH IS YOU

02:29:46.277 --> 02:29:49.480 region:rollup2
ROUGH BUDGET IMPLICATIONS FOR

I'M ALL ALONE MY STAFF BECAUSE

02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:00.625 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS LATE BREAKING

02:29:58.990 --> 02:30:01.759 region:rollup2
NEWS BUT ALREADY WHEN WE PASSED

02:30:00.625 --> 02:30:03.228 region:rollup2
AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:04.295 region:rollup2
BUDGET FOR PUBLICATION WE KNEW

02:30:03.228 --> 02:30:06.064 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:07.332 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION TO THE GOOD BASED

02:30:06.064 --> 02:30:09.100 region:rollup2
ON HOW WE HAD BUILT IN OUR

02:30:07.332 --> 02:30:11.503 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS.

02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:13.037 region:rollup2
I'M OBVIOUSLY AND THIS LINKED OF

02:30:11.503 --> 02:30:15.240 region:rollup2
AN EXTENSION IS GREAT NEWS FOR

02:30:13.037 --> 02:30:16.908 region:rollup2
US AND WE JUST STARTED REVIEWING

02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:17.508 region:rollup2
THE BILL SO WE HAVE SOME ROUGH

02:30:16.908 --> 02:30:17.675 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS ON

02:30:17.508 --> 02:30:20.445 region:rollup2
HIM

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:21.546 region:rollup2
TO HEAR.

02:30:20.445 --> 02:30:21.713 region:rollup2
YEAH UNDERSEA DEPARTMENT BY IT

02:30:21.546 --> 02:30:23.781 region:rollup2
SO.

02:30:21.713 --> 02:30:25.083 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:30:23.781 --> 02:30:26.618 region:rollup2
FOR THE ONE QUARTER THAT THEY

02:30:25.083 --> 02:30:28.286 region:rollup2
DID ON THE SHORT TERM BASIS AND

02:30:26.618 --> 02:30:29.420 region:rollup2
SO OUT WE ALREADY KNEW WHEN WE

02:30:28.286 --> 02:30:31.422 region:rollup2
RELEASED THE BUDGET WE'RE GOING

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:33.224 region:rollup2
TO BUILD THAT INTO MAY. AND

02:30:31.422 --> 02:30:34.759 region:rollup2
FRANKLY THE RATES AND THE

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:36.327 region:rollup2
POPULATION IN THAT PROGRAMISN'T

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:37.595 region:rollup2
CHANGING SO DRAMATICALLY THAT I

02:30:36.327 --> 02:30:39.297 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT I THINK THAT

02:30:37.595 --> 02:30:40.965 region:rollup2
ONE FIFTY PER QUARTER IS A

02:30:39.297 --> 02:30:42.166 region:rollup2
PRETTY GOOD RULE OF THUMB SO. IN

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.934 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE GONNA GET

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:44.903 region:rollup2
EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT FEDERAL

02:30:42.934 --> 02:30:45.870 region:rollup2
SHARE I'M IN THE BUDGET YEARS

02:30:44.903 --> 02:30:47.338 region:rollup2
WELL YOU COULD PROBABLY MULTIPLY

02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:49.307 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER BY FOUR GET ROUGH

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:51.309 region:rollup2
SETS.

02:30:49.307 --> 02:30:51.910 region:rollup2
AND AND THIS IS MORE COMMENTARY

02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:53.077 region:rollup2
I GUESS.

02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:54.779 region:rollup2
THE.

02:30:53.077 --> 02:30:55.380 region:rollup2
A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE TWO

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:56.614 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

02:30:55.380 --> 02:30:58.349 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:59.817 region:rollup2
GRANTS THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE

02:30:58.349 --> 02:31:02.186 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING TO HELP WITH.

02:30:59.817 --> 02:31:03.688 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FORCE IF YOUR FUEL

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:05.490 region:rollup2
FORCE CHALLENGES WE HAVE.

02:31:03.688 --> 02:31:06.691 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT ACTUALLY THAT

02:31:05.490 --> 02:31:08.226 region:rollup2
NUMBER MAY BE LOW.

02:31:06.691 --> 02:31:09.827 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WE WHAT WE ACTUALLY

02:31:08.226 --> 02:31:12.163 region:rollup2
NEED BUT ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE

02:31:09.827 --> 02:31:14.198 region:rollup2
GRANT PROCESS MIGHT BE ONEROUS

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:15.066 region:rollup2
AND DIFFICULT AND SLOW.

02:31:14.198 --> 02:31:16.968 region:rollup2
AND.

02:31:15.066 --> 02:31:18.503 region:rollup2
NOT NOT TO IT AS AS IT IS WITH

02:31:16.968 --> 02:31:20.138 region:rollup2
A LOT OF AGENCIES ARE NOT JUST

02:31:18.503 --> 02:31:22.240 region:rollup2
PICKING ON CALPERS ON MY CALVET

02:31:20.138 --> 02:31:23.508 region:rollup2
THIS POINT BUT. BUT IS THERE ARE

02:31:22.240 --> 02:31:25.209 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE AN EMPHASIS HELP

02:31:23.508 --> 02:31:26.210 region:rollup2
EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS THE PEOPLE

02:31:25.209 --> 02:31:28.012 region:rollup2
WE CAN ACTUALLY SPEND THIS

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:29.681 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY PROTECT.

02:31:28.012 --> 02:31:32.617 region:rollup2
LIVES AND PROPERTY AND AND OUR

02:31:29.681 --> 02:31:34.652 region:rollup2
FORESTS OR WILL THIS BE.

02:31:32.617 --> 02:31:36.554 region:rollup2
MORE OF A TYPICAL PROCESS.

02:31:34.652 --> 02:31:38.156 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY HAD AN EXEMPTION FOR

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:39.657 region:rollup2
ALL PROGRAMS FUNDED IN THE

02:31:38.156 --> 02:31:40.692 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR ADDED GIGI ARE AT

02:31:39.657 --> 02:31:42.927 region:rollup2
FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE

02:31:40.692 --> 02:31:44.162 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES ACT ONTO YOUR POINT

02:31:42.927 --> 02:31:46.364 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF ACTS BUT AT SOME OF

02:31:44.162 --> 02:31:47.932 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS GOING OUT SO I'M

02:31:46.364 --> 02:31:50.001 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY THE CAL FIRE

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:52.403 region:rollup2
PROJECT IS ONE THAT WOULD APPLY.

02:31:50.001 --> 02:31:53.504 region:rollup2
FOR THAT EXEMPTION.

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:54.806 region:rollup2
AND JUST YOU KNOW IT WEIRD AS

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:56.207 region:rollup2
YOUR TALK ABOUT METRICS EARLIER

02:31:54.806 --> 02:31:57.842 region:rollup2
AND AND CONCERNS.

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:59.177 region:rollup2
I REPRESENT THE AREA THAT HAVE

02:31:57.842 --> 02:32:01.879 region:rollup2
THE TUBS FIRE.

02:31:59.177 --> 02:32:02.680 region:rollup2
WHICH UNTIL THOMAS FIRE WAS THE

02:32:01.879 --> 02:32:03.448 region:rollup2
THE MOST EXPENSIVE FIRE IN THE

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:05.683 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:32:03.448 --> 02:32:07.819 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK ONE OF THE.

02:32:05.683 --> 02:32:09.520 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS THAT THAT I'VE HAD

02:32:07.819 --> 02:32:11.322 region:rollup2
IN AWHILE WHILE THIS FIRE WAS

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:12.323 region:rollup2
UNIQUE I IN THAT THEY ALL ARE

02:32:11.322 --> 02:32:13.758 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:32:12.323 --> 02:32:16.194 region:rollup2
WE LOST A LOT OF FORCE LAND WE

02:32:13.758 --> 02:32:16.794 region:rollup2
ALSO IS IS DIFFERENT AND SOME OF

02:32:16.194 --> 02:32:17.762 region:rollup2
THE OTHER FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:19.697 region:rollup2
IN THE SIERRAS.

02:32:17.762 --> 02:32:20.164 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING I'M HOPING AT SOME

02:32:19.697 --> 02:32:22.333 region:rollup2
POINT.

02:32:20.164 --> 02:32:23.835 region:rollup2
THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:32:22.333 --> 02:32:24.836 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SYMMETRIX SO WE

02:32:23.835 --> 02:32:26.604 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE.

02:32:24.836 --> 02:32:27.939 region:rollup2
THEIMPLICATIONS OF TO

02:32:26.604 --> 02:32:29.574 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN THESE

02:32:27.939 --> 02:32:31.009 region:rollup2
LARGE FIRES ERUPT I MEAN

02:32:29.574 --> 02:32:32.510 region:rollup2
ANECDOTALLY WE'VE HEARD THAT.

02:32:31.009 --> 02:32:34.712 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE LARGE FIRES.

02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:35.680 region:rollup2
EXCEEDS OR EQUALS.

02:32:34.712 --> 02:32:38.116 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE.

02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:39.350 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM

02:32:38.116 --> 02:32:41.519 region:rollup2
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS FOR A SINGLE

02:32:39.350 --> 02:32:44.555 region:rollup2
YEAR AND WE HAD. MULTIPLE EVENTS

02:32:41.519 --> 02:32:45.523 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR AND SO THAT BRINGS MY

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:46.791 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS ARE WE.

02:32:45.523 --> 02:32:48.960 region:rollup2
ARE WE GETTING OUR BANG FOR OUR

02:32:46.791 --> 02:32:50.328 region:rollup2
BUCK HERE ARE QUITE FRANKLY I

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:53.398 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED IN MY DISTRICT THE

02:32:50.328 --> 02:32:55.900 region:rollup2
WORST AIR QUALITY EVER RECORDED.

02:32:53.398 --> 02:32:57.335 region:rollup2
EVER RECORDED YET.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:58.403 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO OUR

02:32:57.335 --> 02:32:59.270 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS FROM THE AIR

02:32:58.403 --> 02:33:00.538 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BOARD FOR

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:02.306 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF

02:33:00.538 --> 02:33:03.941 region:rollup2
WHICH I REPRESENT A LOT.

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:05.610 region:rollup2
WE DON'T GET THE RESOURCES

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:07.145 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE.

02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:08.713 region:rollup2
AND VIRUS SCAN AND THE WAY

02:33:07.145 --> 02:33:09.247 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE CALCULATED.

02:33:08.713 --> 02:33:11.449 region:rollup2
SO.

02:33:09.247 --> 02:33:13.618 region:rollup2
I WAS LOOKING FOR RECOGNITION

02:33:11.449 --> 02:33:15.119 region:rollup2
THAT. WOW THERE'S A THIS AIR

02:33:13.618 --> 02:33:16.454 region:rollup2
QUALITY IS REALLY BAD AND THERE

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:18.222 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE RESOURCES HERE AND

02:33:16.454 --> 02:33:19.891 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT

02:33:18.222 --> 02:33:21.559 region:rollup2
THIS ACTUALLY IS A CONTRIBUTOR

02:33:19.891 --> 02:33:23.728 region:rollup2
TO GREENHOUSE GASES.

02:33:21.559 --> 02:33:24.295 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT NUMBER REALLY AS

02:33:23.728 --> 02:33:26.130 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:33:24.295 --> 02:33:27.465 region:rollup2
I'D YOU KNOW I'D I JUST WORRY

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:28.833 region:rollup2
THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION I

02:33:27.465 --> 02:33:29.901 region:rollup2
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND I

02:33:28.833 --> 02:33:31.369 region:rollup2
REALLY APPRECIATE BUT THE

02:33:29.901 --> 02:33:32.870 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT MAKE UP THERE. BUT

02:33:31.369 --> 02:33:34.672 region:rollup2
I JUST FEAR THAT IS REALLY

02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:36.908 region:rollup2
REALLY NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:37.408 region:rollup2
SO A MAN ONLY DEPARTMENT FINANCE

02:33:36.908 --> 02:33:39.577 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:40.711 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE KAPPA DRITTE

02:33:39.577 --> 02:33:43.381 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE.

02:33:40.711 --> 02:33:45.349 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS THAT.

02:33:43.381 --> 02:33:47.085 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION

02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:47.985 region:rollup2
RELEASES AN ANNUAL REPORT TO

02:33:47.085 --> 02:33:49.687 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

02:33:47.985 --> 02:33:51.022 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:49.687 --> 02:33:52.290 region:rollup2
INTO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE

02:33:51.022 --> 02:33:53.257 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES

02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:54.892 region:rollup2
THAT HAS.

02:33:53.257 --> 02:33:57.161 region:rollup2
RESULTED AS A RESULT OF THE

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:59.997 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES OF CAPITATE FUNDS

02:33:57.161 --> 02:34:02.133 region:rollup2
IN WITHIN THAT IS A ESTIMATION

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:03.568 region:rollup2
OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS

02:34:02.133 --> 02:34:04.669 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECTS

02:34:03.568 --> 02:34:06.471 region:rollup2
THAT ARE FUNDED.

02:34:04.669 --> 02:34:08.005 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY AT THE

02:34:06.471 --> 02:34:09.207 region:rollup2
HEALTHY FOREST PROGRAM THAT'S

02:34:08.005 --> 02:34:12.110 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED BY.

02:34:09.207 --> 02:34:14.378 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE. THAT IS ONE OF THE

02:34:12.110 --> 02:34:15.446 region:rollup2
MORE COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS NOT

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:17.482 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE.

02:34:15.446 --> 02:34:18.349 region:rollup2
OF WHAT YOU WERE ALLUDING TO

02:34:17.482 --> 02:34:20.084 region:rollup2

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:22.053 region:rollup2
.

02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:23.621 region:rollup2
AVOIDANCE OF.

02:34:22.053 --> 02:34:26.324 region:rollup2
OF.

02:34:23.621 --> 02:34:27.358 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATE WITH FIRES

02:34:26.324 --> 02:34:29.093 region:rollup2
BUT THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:34:27.358 --> 02:34:29.527 region:rollup2
BENEFITS

02:34:29.093 --> 02:34:31.596 region:rollup2
OF.

02:34:29.527 --> 02:34:34.365 region:rollup2
OF TREES

02:34:31.596 --> 02:34:34.832 region:rollup2
SO IT'S KIND OF A WIN WIN ON

02:34:34.365 --> 02:34:36.167 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE LEVELS THAT.

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:38.002 region:rollup2
.

02:34:36.167 --> 02:34:39.670 region:rollup2
YOU NO REDUCES RISK IN TERMS OF

02:34:38.002 --> 02:34:40.238 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY IT REDUCES

02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:40.872 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH

WITH WILDFIRES AS WELL AS THE.

02:34:45.309 --> 02:34:50.648 region:rollup2
HAS CARBON SINK BENEFIT SO.

02:34:47.812 --> 02:34:52.950 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY.

02:34:50.648 --> 02:34:55.019 region:rollup2
WE HAD SUCH A MAJOR INVESTMENT

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:55.553 region:rollup2
IN THE HEALTHY FORCE PROGRAM WAS

02:34:55.019 --> 02:34:58.523 region:rollup2
A FOR THAT VERY REASON YOU

02:34:55.553 --> 02:35:00.124 region:rollup2
ALLUDED TO.

02:34:58.523 --> 02:35:02.793 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND HOPE

02:35:00.124 --> 02:35:04.695 region:rollup2
ON ONGOING BASIS THAT WE CAN.

02:35:02.793 --> 02:35:07.465 region:rollup2
MORE OF THAT I YOU KNOW IT WE

02:35:04.695 --> 02:35:09.834 region:rollup2
HEAR THAT STUFF I'VE HEARD FROM.

02:35:07.465 --> 02:35:11.302 region:rollup2
DEBT THAT PEOPLE IN CARD SOME

02:35:09.834 --> 02:35:11.869 region:rollup2
OF THEM ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT

02:35:11.302 --> 02:35:13.171 region:rollup2
THESE FORCE FIRES OR ACTS OF

02:35:11.869 --> 02:35:14.839 region:rollup2
GOD.

02:35:13.171 --> 02:35:16.574 region:rollup2
I WOULD DISAGREE I THINK THAT WE

02:35:14.839 --> 02:35:18.609 region:rollup2
HAVE MADE SOME OF THE SITUATIONS

02:35:16.574 --> 02:35:20.411 region:rollup2
WORSE UP BY OUR INABILITY TO

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:22.814 region:rollup2
MANAGE FORESTS. AND.

02:35:20.411 --> 02:35:24.182 region:rollup2
AND SO SO I'M JUST LOOKING I'M

02:35:22.814 --> 02:35:26.450 region:rollup2
A NUMBERS PERSON I WANT TO SEE

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:28.819 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH CARBON CAN BE

02:35:27.652 --> 02:35:30.087 region:rollup2
SEQUESTERED WHEN WE ACTUALLY DO

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:31.422 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS. ALSO

02:35:30.087 --> 02:35:32.857 region:rollup2
UNDERESTIMATE HOW MUCH CARBON WE

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:34.058 region:rollup2
BLOW OFF WHEN WE HAVE THESE BIG

02:35:32.857 --> 02:35:35.560 region:rollup2
FIRES I WANT TO SEE THOSE

02:35:34.058 --> 02:35:36.827 region:rollup2
COMPARISONS BECAUSE I THINK WE

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:38.162 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE

02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:40.898 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING.

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:42.099 region:rollup2
