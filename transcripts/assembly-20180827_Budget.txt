TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'M WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THINK IT WAS FROM. NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR WHAT REASON WAS THIS LAST AMENDMENT -- INCORPORATED IT INTO THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL THAT'S ARE THE EMPLOYMENT TRAILER BILL. THIS WAS INCLUDED TO BASICALLY I'M PROVIDED CLARIFICATION THAT. ON PRIOR TO JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH AND THE DECISION THAT IN THIS CASE THAT THOSE FAIR SHARED USE THAT WERE DEDUCTED -- WERE DIE IN THAT WERE PERMITTED AT THE ALLOWABLE UNDER. AND WHY DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS CLARIFICATION SHOULD BE MADE RATHER THAN ABIDING BY THE RULING OF THE COURT. AND REALLY -- AS FAR AS THIS IS CONCERNED I'M A REALLY IS CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- BY MAKING THIS CHANGE IT -- BASICALLY CLARIFIES THE INTENT THAT IT EXISTED PRIOR TO THAT DECISION. OKAY BUT I DON'T I'M NOT GOING TO BE A JOKE ABOUT IT BUT I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU. AND OTHER COURT ACTUALLY DIDN'T RULE ON WHETHER OR NOT THE IT'S RULING COULD BE APPLIED RETROACTIVELY AND I'M SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING SOME KIND OF FEDERAL. PRESIDENT SAID IN ESTABLISHING THAT SO I I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE ANY BUSINESS. ESTABLISHED ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL I DON'T THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT WE DO HERE IS GOING TO STAND. OUT IN PARTICULARLY I DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET SO -- THAT'S ANOTHER OBJECTION I HAVE AS TO WHY IT'S BEING INCLUDED A TRAILER BILL COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY OF THE CONTROLLER TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS AND? IT WOULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT FUTURE LIABILITY ON THIS WOULD APPLY TO ANY KEEP APPENDING OR FUTURE CLAIMS. I WHICH WOULD. TIE BACK TO POTENTIAL YET COSTS FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS. OKAY THAT THAT'S TENUOUS TO ME THAT THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION WE ALWAYS USED TO TIE SOMETHING THAT'S POLICY INTO THE BUDGET. SO ARE AN UNFORTUNATE I WAS LOOKING FOR VOTING FOR THIS UNFORTUNATE NOW BECAUSE OF THIS AMENDMENT. I WOULD HAVE TO OPPOSE IT BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. I THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHT FOUR SIX MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UP OPPOSITION TO SB. EIGHT FOUR SIX OKAY SEEN NUMBER GONNA MOVE FORWARD TO S. B.. EIGHT SEVEN THREE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM ARE USED TO DISCUSS. BUT THAT PLEASE BEGIN. S. B. EIGHT SEVENTY THREE RATIFIES THE CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND BARGAINING UNIT NINE THE ENGINEERS AND BARGAINING UNITS AND SCIENTISTS. OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DO NOT TAKEN. DO NOT TAKE EFFECT UNLESS OF FUNDS ARE SPECIFICALLY APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE BILL APPROPRIATES HUNDRED THIRTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION SIX POINT TWO MILLION WHICH IS GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CAREER COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH BOTH CONTRACTS. OF INCREASE OR THE AGREEMENT WITH PEG I'M IMPACTS APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. NICK WHO THE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE OF FOUR POINT JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND 4% BEGINNING JULY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN OF THE AGREEMENT WITH GUARDIAN TEN IMPACTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND INCLUDES THE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE OF 5% BEGINNING. JULY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN IN ANOTHER 5% INCREASE BEGINNING JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY WITHOUT I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEES MISTER WOULDN'T. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEELS THAT THESE. MEMORANDUMS ARE FISCALLY PRUDENT. SO -- I'LL TAKE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT CONCERN ME SO THE DEMO YOU WITH BARGAINING UNIT. NINE HAS A GENERAL SORRY OF INCREASE OF FOUR POINT 5% THE FIRST YEAR 4% THE SECOND YEAR -- BARDEEN ATTEND THE INCREASES ARE GENERAL SALARY INCREASES THERE'S A NUMBER OF INCREASES FOR PAY DIFFERENTIALS ALLOWANCES RETENTION BONUSES THINGS LIKE THAT SO. IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL. THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THOSE BARGAINING UNITS AND I WAS LOOKING ON YOUR WEBSITE LAST NIGHT. TO SEE IF I'D MISSED SOMETHING AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE TO PUT DEAL LAUGHS ESTIMATE FOR THE INFLATION RATE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN TAKING UP RECENTLY IS STILL WELL UNDER 4%. SO I'M WONDERING HOW YOU FEEL LIKE THESE. THESE INCREASES ARE JUSTIFIED BECAUSE IT'S ALARMING TO ME I MEAN CLEARLY IF WE I CONTINUALLY TO IT TO CONTINUE TO GRANT SALARY INCREASES. IN EXCESS OF THE RATE OF INFLATION TO OUR EMPLOYEES -- WE WOULD RUN OUT OF MONEY VERY QUICKLY STE IT'S CLEARLY NOT A SUSTAINABLE ACTION FOR YOU TO TAKE SO HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THOSE LEVELS OF INCREASE FOR THOSE TWO BARGAINING UNITS. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS THAT -- YOU THESE ARE BOTH AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE. NAM AND THE UNION ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THEY DO INCLUDE OTHER PROVISIONS OUTSIDE OF JUST THE STANDARD GENERAL SALARY INCREASES. I WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE FAIR DEALS ON GIVEN SALARY SURVEYS THAT WERE DONE. TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP THE STATE ONLINE WITH. AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- SO I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THESE DEALS FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PAID CONTRACT. ON THE TWO YEAR BUDGETARY COSTS ON THIS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOW MAY POINT FOUR MILLION WHICH IS GENERAL FUND. THE CONTRACT WITH THE SCIENTISTS THAT IS A THREE YEAR THERE HAS A THREE YEAR BUDGETARY COSTS OF ABOUT SIXTY THREE AND A HALF MILLION. OF WHICH TWELVE POINT ONE MILLION IS GENERAL FUND -- BUT JUST TO REITERATE ME OF THESE ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE. TOM AND THE UNIONS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE FAIR DEALS ON PRESENTED BEFORE YOU. OKAY SO AMEND THE QUESTION WAS. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY? WHY THAT THOSE ARE FAIR GIVEN THE FACT THAT INFLATION IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS? AND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE ANSWER YOU GAVE ME WAS WELL THAT'S WHAT WE NEGOTIATED WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WAS ASKING WAS ASKING. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT BEING A FAIR DEAL. AND I WOULD SAY THAT SOME IN ADDITION TO BEING SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS HOW WE DO LOOK AT SELLERS SERVICE EVER DONE TO HOPEFULLY. ON KEEP THE STATE SALARIES IN LINE WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THEIR PEERS COME IN. YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OKAY I DONE UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T FIND THAT ANSWER SATISFACTORY BUT NORMALLY I IN AND YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I'VE SUPPORTED THEM OR USE THAT. WE'VE HAD WITH OTHER BARGAINING UNITS WHEN I THINK THAT THERE FISCALLY PRUDENT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE STATE I CERTAINLY AM INTERESTED IN COMPENSATING. ALL OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES FAIRLY BRITISH JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T SEEM PRUDENT TO APPROVE THIS LEVEL FISCAL INCREASE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT I THINK YOUR POINT ABOUT INFLATION'S VERY THERE WILL TAKE AND I WOULD SAY I KNOW THAT. THE BAY AREA WE HAVE VERY MUCH RECRUITING AND RETAINING STATE EMPLOYEES. SIMPLY BECAUSE FRANKLY ALTHOUGH I COUNTIES IN MANY OF THE CITY'S ACTUALLY PAY MORE SO THAT OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE IN ONE OF THE FACTORS AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. CHURCH AT NIGHT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER CHAIR AND I'VE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL -- HOWEVER LAWMAKER POINT THAT YOU NEVER CAN ASSUME THAT PAY DIFFERENTIAL IS THE REASON WHY YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE OF RETAINING EMPLOYEES. AND IF YOU SUSPECT THAT THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TO DO A STUDY IN WHICH TO YOU INTERVIEW DON'T EXERT OUR VIEW WITH EMPLOYEES WHO ARE LEAVING. AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHY THEY'RE LEAVING AND WHAT YOU FIND OUT IS IS DISPLAY A WIDE VARIETY OF REASONS AND OF THAT AT THAT. CAN SUGGEST CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR THE STATE BUT YOU CERTAINLY NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT STEP BEFORE YOU RUSH TO GRANTING. A AND M. O. U. S. SALARY INCREASES THAT ARE WELL IN EXCESS OF INFLATION -- YEAH AND THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL. FAIR ENOUGH I BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS MY COMMITTEE. UP WITH THAT OUR PUBLIC COMMENT IS SUPPORT. MONTH S. B. -- EIGHT SEVEN THREE MISTER CHAIRMAN GOOD EVENING I AM A TWO FOR TONIGHT TO TOP AND FOR UNIT NINE AND UNIT. TEN IN SUPPORT OF THESE COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED AGREEMENTS -- TO YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE I'D SAY THAT INFLATION. IS NOT THE FACTOR THAT IS MOST IMPORTANT HERE BUT THE COMPETITIVENESS OF THE JOB MARKET FOR ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS. THIS IS A FULL EMPLOYMENT. ECONOMY WHERE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS HAVE VERY VERY VERY VERY MANY OP [inaudible] AND THIS AGREEMENT BOTH THE PAGAN THE CAPS AGREEMENT. KEEPS THEM COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNTERPARTS [inaudible] AND NOT. PRIVATE SECTOR OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE. TO ALSO TAKE -- SO THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER BOTH FAIR AND REASONABLE AGREEMENTS. WE WOULD URGE ANOTHER. THANK YOU NEITHER PRIOR COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF ANY [inaudible] COMMENTS. IN OPPOSITION TURNER BE EIGHT SEVEN THREE OKAY. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS REMOVED S. B. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN WHICH IS OUR GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRIBAL. S. B. EIGHT SEVENTY SEVEN IS THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT TRAILER BILL ON THIS WAS ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE AUGUST FIFTEENTH HEARING BY THIS COMMITTEE. MEMBER SINCE THAT TIME OUR TECHNICAL IN NATURE EQUAL APPLICATION OF ITS PROVISIONS STALL WARNING BODIES. OF FOR EMERGENCY PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. THANK IN THIS MOMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO. WE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL LAST WEEK I'M AND I DID OFFER SOME AMENDMENTS TO SENATE BILL TO SUPPLEMENTS ARE I GUESS COMPLEMENT THE AUDIT PROPOSAL BY MY COLLEAGUE. AND SAID WE COULD SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN AT THE DMV. AND SPECIFICALLY THE AUDIT WOULD HAVE DETERMINE THE AVERAGE WAIT TIMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AND WITHOUT APPOINTMENTS. I WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED THE STEPS DMB HAS TAKEN TO REDUCE WAIT TIMES IN INCREASE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY BUT ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER WAIT TIMES HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE DMB BEGAN OFFERING. REAL ID DRIVER'S LICENSES ID CARDS. WHAT ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DME IS ON TRACK TO MEET A TIRING EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER EMPLOYEES ARE ADEQUATELY TRAINED AMONG OTHER THINGS? AUGUST EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE REJECTED MY COLLEAGUES PER REQUEST FOR A COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF THE DIEM THE TO INVESTIGATE. THE WAIT TIME CRISIS AND ON THAT SAME DAY. THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BODY CAM BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVED. SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES -- AT WHICH IN MY MIND IS GIVING THE DMB A BLANK CHECK WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTIONS OR STRINGS AND I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS. IN THIS ROOM AND EVEN THOSE WHO ARE AT THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. AT THE DMV AND I DON'T. I JUST WANT EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND I DON'T BLAME. DMB EMPLOYEES I DON'T THINK THEY CREATED THE PROBLEM I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE TO CREATE THOSE PROBLEMS -- I KNOW THE DMB EMPLOYEES THAT I'VE SPOKEN WITH IN FACT THE ONE I WOMAN WE SPOKE WITH. WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS GETTING HER TO PERMIT HER DRIVER'S LICENSE SHE SAID? SHE USED TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ABOUT -- COMPLETE ABOUT. FOURTY TRANSACTIONS A DAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE THAT REMAIN SHE'S NOW DOWN THE TWENTY FIVE SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO MISUNDERSTAND THAT SOMEHOW I THINK DMB EMPLOYEES ARE SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE. I JUST THINK THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE NOR DO WE SO HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY EXPECT THEM TO FIX IT? AND JUST GIVING THEM MORE MONEY I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT MONEY ISN'T THE ISSUE I THINK IT'S THE PROCESS -- SO AN AUDIT WOULD HAVE TOLD US EXACTLY WHERE THE PROBLEM IS BUT UNFORTUNATELY. AND WE DIDN'T GET THAT AUDIT I'M DISAPPOINTED BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE TIME. THAT THE CHAIR HAS ALLOWED ME TO ACT -- TO EXPRESS -- NOT ONLY MY FRUSTRATION I THINK FRUSTRATION OF A LOT OF PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF ALLEN THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S MORE THAN PRETTY SET UP FRUSTRATION ISLAM SPREAD THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY [inaudible] ON KIND OF DEPARTMENT FINANCES ANY COMMENT ON THAT OR NOT. NUMBER PONDERED PUBLIC FINANCING DIDN'T QUITE YOUR QUESTION THEIR OWN. BUT YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT A CONTINUES TO BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THEY'RE TAKING THEM ON YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF MEASURES -- THAT ARE BRINGING DOWN WAIT TIMES -- I THINK -- MC THE BUSIER OFFICES HIGHS OF BRICK BRING HIM DOWN BY. 27% SO THEN ANOTHER MAKING A LOT OF EFFORT THAT THANK YOU -- WITH THAT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE NOT SING IN THE AND I SEE ANY OTHER FURTHER COME ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OPPOSED S. B. [inaudible] EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN OKAY. NOT WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE OUR HEARING. BUDGET COMMITTEE JERKED
