00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:22.335
THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:25.037
EXTENT I'M ONE. OKAY I WAS

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.772
CONCERNED THAT EXTENDING THE

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.609
TIMELINE FURTHER WOULD ENDANGER

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.310
THE INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN

00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:35.648
AT THE S. P. AND C. C. W. F. SO

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:36.649
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.552
SURE. THAT THEY HAVE SAFE WATER

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.320
WHILE THIS TIME LINE IS

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:46.158
EXTENDED- AS I ALSO MENTIONED-

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:48.995
THE- EXTENDED TIMELINE REALLY

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.897
ONLY REPRESENTS A COUPLE OF

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.299
MONTHS- BECAUSE OF THE TIMING

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.067
OF THE- ANTICIPATED A

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:56.202
CONCLUSION OF WORKING DRAWINGS

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.070
WHICH IS NOW EXPECTED TO BE

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:00.006
LATE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR-

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:04.043
SO- IN THE IN THE MEANTIME- THE

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.978
WATER WILL BE CONTINUE TO PLAN

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.347
TO PROVIDE A SAFE WATER

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.682
SUPPLIES TO THE INSTITUTION.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:13.719
OKAY THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES. YES

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:16.188
SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.924
MEDICARE SO THERE'S AN A LA A

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.493
REPORT- THAT INDICATES THERE

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.228
BELIEVE THAT UP TO FIVE PRISONS

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:26.399
COULD BE CLOSED- IS VSP ONE OF

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.033
THOSE PRISON IS LIKELY TO BE ON

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:37.810
THAT LIST. THE LEGISLATIVE

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.445
ANALYST'S OFFICE. WOULD YOU

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.380
LIKE US TO ADDRESS THAT

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.449
QUESTION CENTER NEWMAN. I GUESS

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:44.517
YOU COULD START FIRST NAME LIKE

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.818
HERE FROM CITIES YOUR SHORT I

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.787
GUESS. THE CONCERN IS IF THE

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:50.189
IF- THIS WINDS UP. IF IT IS

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.457
TRUE THAT WE CAN CLOSE FIVE

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.259
PRISONS AND THIS WERE ONE OF

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.628
THOSE PERSPECTIVE FIVE- THE

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:58.631
THAT WOULD PREEMPT THE NEED FOR

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:03.970
THIS PROJECT OBVIOUSLY- SO WE-

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.505
AS AS YOU INDICATED WE HAVE AN

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:09.909
SSN BASED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.477
POPULATION PROJECTIONS. AT THE

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:13.813
STATE COULD CLOSE FIVE PRISONS

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.282
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ONE OF

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:17.516
THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.351
PLANNED TO CLOSE THE DOOR

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:19.919
VOCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.487
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE PRISONS

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.389
THAT LEAVES FOR LEFT IT

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:26.025
APARTMENT HASN'T- INDICATED

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:30.262
WHAT PRISON IT WILL CLOSE- IN

00:10:30.329 --> 00:10:30.896
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.565
WHICH IT PLANS IT HAS INDICATED

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.899
IT WILL CLOSE ONE PRISON BEYOND

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.835
THAT THAT DEPARTMENT HASN'T

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.504
INDICATED ANY OTHER- OR

00:10:38.571 --> 00:10:39.538
COMMITTED TO ANY FURTHER PRISON

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:42.174
CLOSURES- HOWEVER BASED ON OUR

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.644
INITIAL- ASSESSMENT. WE THINK

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.179
THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:50.216
REHABILITATION CENTER IN NORCO.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:52.051
THAT CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY IN

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.986
SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN QUENTIN

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:56.022
STATE PRISON AND CORRECTIONAL

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:57.390
TRAINING FACILITY IN SOLEDAD

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.325
ALL APPEAR TO BE. REASONABLE

00:10:59.392 --> 00:11:01.027
CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE GIVEN

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:03.896
THEIR HIGH INFRASTRUCTURE COST-

00:11:03.963 --> 00:11:05.664
AND RELATIVELY HIGH OPERATIONAL

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.968
COSTS IN COMPARISON TO THEIR IN

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.936
THE CAPACITY. CREATURE THAT'S

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.271
ARE THERE AND THEN BY INFERENCE

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:16.008
THEN THE OBVIOUS P. THAT IS DUE

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.176
FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADE

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.511
WOULD NOT BE ON THAT LIST AND

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.446
THEIR FOURTH THIS IS A

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:20.980
REASONABLE EXPENSE LOOKING

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:25.518
FORWARD. RIGHT AS WE DON'T IN

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:26.852
OUR REVIEW WE HAVEN'T

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.354
IDENTIFIED VALLEY STATE PRISON

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.989
AS A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.458
CLOSURE- ALTHOUGH AS YOU'LL

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.727
HEAR ME DISCUSS LATER IN ONE OF

00:11:34.794 --> 00:11:35.461
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE DO

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.695
RECOMMEND THAT THE-

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.297
ADMINISTRATION COME FORWARD

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.965
WITH A LIST OF LIKELY. AG

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.001
PRISONS FOR CLOSURE FOR THE

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.103
PURPOSES OF THIS IMPLEMENTING

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.438
OUR RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.007
D. AS- PROPOSED AGGREGATION FOR

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:48.874
SPECIAL REPAIR DEFERRED

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.076
MAINTENANCE SO TO THE EXTENT

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:52.144
THE INITIATION DID. INCLUDE

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.047
THAT PRISON AS A- A LIKELY

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:57.349
CANDIDATE THAT IT BELIEVES-

00:11:57.416 --> 00:11:58.684
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR CLOSURE

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.119
THEN OF COURSE WE WOULD HAVE.

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:00.986
CONCERNS WITH THIS CAPITAL

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:03.589
OUTLAY PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD

00:12:03.656 --> 00:12:05.558
FISH AT THAT SO I WOULD SUGGEST

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:07.193
THAT A PRISON WHERE THE WATER

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:13.732
IS. A SUSPECT QUALITY MIGHT BE.

00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:14.300
CONSIDERED AT SOME POINT FOR

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:17.369
THAT LIST. THANK YOU. SECRETARY

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:18.938
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:21.373
GOING BACK TO- PICTURES

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.843
QUESTION ABOUT. SO THE QUALITY

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.111
OF THE WATER OR WRIST THE

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.979
INMATES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:29.014
MONTHS MMHM WELL THE PROJECTS

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:34.753
BEING- RECALCULATED REBUILD-

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.856
WHAT CAN YOU JUST. TAKE A

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:38.390
LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:40.526
WITH US IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.562
WHY THIS IS NOT A RISK I HEARD

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:46.799
OF THE TERM- YOU KNOW THE-

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.334
THAT'LL BE A BLENDED APPROACH

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.670
IN THE MEANTIME- IF YOU'RE IF

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:52.905
YOU'RE TALKING I DON'T WANT TO

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:54.473
PUT WORDS IN ANYONE'S MOUTH OR

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.375
MY OWN MIND IS THAT. THE IDEA

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.744
THAT YOU'RE- DILUTING THE- THE

00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:00.913
ARSENIC AND MANGANESE LEVELS BY

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.751
BY IMPORTING. A WATER- TOOK TO

00:13:05.818 --> 00:13:07.620
BLEND WITH THE WELL WATER IN.

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.221
AND DEPENDING ON THE ANSWER

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.390
THAT QUESTION I GUESS THE FAULT

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:12.892
QUESTIONS WOULD BE. YOU KNOW

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.493
WHY NOT JUST IMPORT WATER INTO

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.128
INTO INTO THE TANKS OF THE

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:18.030
WORLD'S WOULD NORMALLY FEED ON

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.532
INTERFACES OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:22.368
SOME COST TO THAT BUT- TO

00:13:22.434 --> 00:13:27.106
ELIMINATE THE INMATE RISK. YEAH

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:31.110
SURE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:34.547
THE QUESTION- SO THERE IS NO

00:13:34.613 --> 00:13:38.751
EXTERNAL WATER SOURCE- OR- FEES

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.686
FOR THE WATER SUPPLY SO WHAT

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:43.022
THE SITUATION WE HAVE IS THERE

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.958
ARE SEVERAL WELLS SOME OF WHICH

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:49.361
HAVE- THAT ARSENIC LEVELS THAT

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.431
EXCEED. DRINKING WATER

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.099
STANDARDS BUT OTHERS THAT DO

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.001
NOT SEEN BY BLENDING THEM

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:58.671
TOGETHER OR WE CAN STAY UNDER-

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:02.174
THE- THE DRINKING WATER

00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:04.410
STANDARDS FOR ARSENIC AND

00:14:04.476 --> 00:14:08.147
MANGANESE- I JUST NEED IT

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:11.016
BECAUSE WE SEE- A TRANS- IN ALL

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.118
THE WELLS INCREASING LEVELS.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.486
ARE BUT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.622
THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY PROBLEM

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.557
WITH LANDING OVER THE

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:23.562
FORECASTED- PROJECT TIMELINE-

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:26.865
DESERT CIRCLING BACK- TO ELYAS-

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.568
COMMENTS- I WOULD JUST POINT

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.837
OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:33.639
COMMITTED SAID THE CLOSURE OF

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.608
TWO PRESENTS AND NOTHING BEYOND

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:38.978
THAT AT THIS TIME- AND I HAVE.

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.380
AND ALSO I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.048
WATER TREATMENT PLANTS A

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:44.717
SERVICE BOTH ABOUT THE STATE

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.118
PRISON AND THE CENTRAL

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:50.389
CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY-

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:52.725
SO- THE PRICE WOULD BE NEEDED

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:55.961
UNLESS BOTH PERSONS. AND THAT'S

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.130
VERY UNLIKELY SINCE THIS CAL

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:01.634
WOMEN'S IS- ONE OF A FEW

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.005
WOMEN'S PRISON FIFTH. THANK YOU

UP ON THE EARLIER QUESTIONS AS

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.244
WELL. IT IS ONE ONE LAST

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.847
QUESTION WHAT WHAT'S THE TOTAL

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:16.915
GALLONS USED PER DAY- TO SUPPLY

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:40.306
THE FACILITY. DON'T HAVE- LET

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:41.807
ME LET ME LET ME TAKE A SHORT

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.342
CUT WAY OF DEALING DEALING WITH

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.010
WHAT I'M GETTING AT I KNOW YOU

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:46.211
SAID THAT THERE'S NO ALTERNATE

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.313
SOURCE WATER WITH I MEAN

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.580
THERE'S ALWAYS AN ALTERNATIVE

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:51.684
SOURCE WATER WHICH IS TAKING%

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.754
BRINGING IT IN- THERE'S RASHES

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:57.656
AND FACILITIES ALL OVER OF MY

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.725
DISTRICT IN IN THE HILLS OF

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.393
SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT DEPEND

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.861
UPON A PERCENT ON IMPORTED

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:05.264
WATER LIKE THAT- AND I WAS JUST

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.032
TRYING TO GET AN IDEA AS TO

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.901
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S-

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.469
COMPLETELY INFEASIBLE

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:12.237
IMPRACTICABLE I GUESS IN TERMS

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:17.409
OF THE TOTAL USAGE. A PER DAY-

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:18.844
UP. NORTH THAT WAS EVEN

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:21.513
COMPARED YOU KNOW TO THE

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.648
SPLENDID APPROACH AS AS AN

00:16:22.715 --> 00:16:26.218
ALTERNATIVE. AND ALLOW ME SAY I

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.419
AM NOT I THINK THE BLENDED

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.554
APPROACH IS PROBABLY A GOOD

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.622
IDEA I'M JUST I'M JUST CURIOUS

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:33.258
ENOUGH AT THIS POINT TO. ASK

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:33.859
THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.694
NOT YOU COULD BE JUST. SAID HEY

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:38.063
FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS WE'LL

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:38.630
JUST. WE'LL JUST IMPORT THE

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:42.735
WATER. I DON'T HAVE THIS

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:45.537
SPECIFIC- VOLUME INFORMATION AT

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.706
THE- TOOK MY- FINGERS RIGHT

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:50.175
NOW- HOWEVER AS CERTAINLY

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.411
IMPORTING WATER FOR USE WOULD

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:55.247
BE A- MORE EXPENSIVE. A

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:58.350
TEMPORARY. SOLUTION WE WILL OF

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.252

CONSTITUENTS AND THE WATER. AND

00:17:04.723 --> 00:17:06.859
IF NECESSARY WE WOULD MOVE TO

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:08.193
SOME ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO

SAY OF THEM. RIGHT UNDER THAT

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:20.539
THE MOST. OUR WATER HAS SOME OF

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:22.040
ARSENIC IN IT I DON'T KNOW BUT

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:24.676
MAINLY SO- YOU KNOW IT'S ON

00:17:39.625 --> 00:17:41.093
IF YOU CAN BRING IT DOWN BY

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.662
BLAMING THEM A PERSON BECAUSE

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.464
THAT PROBABLY IS THE BEST

00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:46.031
APPROACH BUT AS I SAID I WAS

00:17:46.098 --> 00:17:49.401

00:25:10.976 --> 00:25:12.410
A MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE

ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT.

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.347
IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:50.749
IS A VERY COMPLICATED AND

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.317
SENSITIVE ISSUE ON THEIR MANY

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:53.785
FACTORS BEYOND JUST

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:54.953
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT GO

HAVE BILL BELICHICK OF PROGRAM

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:07.432
OPPORTUNITIES AT THESE

INSTITUTIONS. HAS COVERED HAS

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:10.635
DEMONSTRATED WE ALSO NEED TO

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:12.237
BEAR IN MIND THE INSTITUTIONS

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.172
NEED A CERTAIN LEVEL SPACE TO

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:16.107
PREVENT- AIRBORNE PATHOGENS

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:18.143
FROM BEING EASILY SPREAD- WHICH

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:19.577
IS AGAIN VERY IMPORTANT FOR

PUBLIC SAFETY. AND FOR COURT

00:26:25.216 --> 00:26:26.918

THEY WILL CLOSE. SO IT'S A

00:26:39.698 --> 00:26:41.299
REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:42.767
IDENTIFYING PRISONS FOR CLOSURE

WAS. CONSIDERED FOR POSSIBLE

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.516
CLOSURE SO WE SET OURSELVES UP

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:00.552
FOR FUTURE COSTS- THAT ARE VERY

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:04.055

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:50.108
THE USAGE OF THE FUNDS- SO THAT

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.476
THEY CANNOT BE SPENT ON PRISONS

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.311
LIKELY TO BE CLOSED IN THE NEAR

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:56.114
FUTURE. AND THAT'S BECAUSE AS I

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.949
MENTIONED EARLIER THIS STATE IS

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.384
PLAIN CLOTHES IN NINETEEN

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.352
PRISON IN TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.553
TWENTY THREE AND COULD WE THINK

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.455
CLOTHES- AROUND THREE

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.958
ADDITIONAL PRISONS- AND THESE

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.192
DEFERRED SPECIAL CARE DEFERRED

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.394
MAINTENANCE PROJECTS CAN TAKE A

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.262
COUPLE YEARS TO COMPLETE SO

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:12.430
IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THE

00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:13.931
STATE WOULD BE COMPLETING THE

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:16.100
REPAIR. AROUND THE TIME THAT

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.635
THE PRISON IS CLOSE WHICH WOULD

00:32:17.702 --> 00:32:19.837
NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE. SO WHAT

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:21.072
WE RECOMMEND APPROVING BUDGET

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.940
BILL LANGUAGE RESTRICTING CDC

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.609
ARE FROM SPENDING THE FUNDS AB

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:26.711
PRISONS LIKELY FOR TO BE CLOSED

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.479
TO FACILITATE THAT WE THINK

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.981
THAT THAT MINISTRATION SHOULD

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:32.083
PROVIDE A LIST OF PRISONS TO BE

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.619
CLOSED- ABSENT THAT BASED ON

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:35.787
OUR INITIAL REVIEW AS I

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:36.654
MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:41.559
IDENTIFIED- FOR PRISONS. THAT

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.193
WE THINK ARE STRONG CANDIDATES.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.895
AND THEN THE SECOND. THAT WE

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.563
HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON IS

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.231
THE- HEALTHCARE FACILITY

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.767
REPAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA REAL.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:52.170
ELEVATION CENTER. A SIMILAR

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.605
ANALYSIS APPLIES HERE AND IT

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:56.207
THE PROPOSAL THAT EXCUSE ME TO

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:57.608
PRISON SEEMS TO BE A STRONG

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:58.776
CANDIDATE FOR CLOSURE IN FACT

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.912
ADMINISTRATION ITSELF IS

00:33:00.978 --> 00:33:01.512
PROPOSED FOR CLOSURE. IN THE

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:06.217
PAST- IF THE PROJECT. THE

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.519
PROJECT WHERE THAT. VERY

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.355
POSSIBLY BE COMPLETED AROUND

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:10.922
THE TIME THAT THE PRISON IS

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:13.591
BEING CLOSED AND AGAIN I WOULD

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:15.526
NOT BE COST EFFECTIVE SO UNLESS

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.161
THAT ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:18.363
A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THIS

00:33:18.429 --> 00:33:21.132
PRISON THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:22.834
THE FACILITY OR EXCUSE ME THAT

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.569
THE PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED

00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:25.970
IN ADVANCE OF A POTENTIAL

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.306
CLOSURE DATE- WE RECOMMEND

00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:31.275
REJECTING. THIS PROPOSAL AND TO

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.510
THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:33.811
DOES GIVE THAT IT COULD

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.513
REALLOCATE THE FUNDS TO.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.681
ADDRESS HIGH PRIORITY

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:37.949
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT

00:33:38.015 --> 00:33:40.051

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:43.788
LIKELY TO BE CLOSED. THANK YOU.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:46.691
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK

00:33:46.758 --> 00:33:48.526

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.483
IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.618
THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:15.553
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.789

THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.370
TOWARDS SATISFYING THE SRO

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.338
REPORT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:37.642
INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:40.812
I'VE HEARD THAT THE CDC ARE

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.547
SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT COMPLY

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:45.082
WITH PARTS OR ALL OF THE S. R.

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:47.919
L. R. L. FROM THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:52.323
AND IT'S QUITE DISTURBING- TO

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.559
HEAR THAT RATHER THAN HERE'S

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.194
WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS AS FAR

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.729
AS WE'VE GOTTEN. SOMETHING TO

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.898
SHOW IS THAT YOU ARE SERIOUS

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.767
ABOUT DOING IT OR IF YOU'RE NOT

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.435
SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THAT THEN

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.003
WE SHOULD KNOW AND WE'LL FIGURE

OUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:10.408
SHOULD DO BUT- I THINK IT'S ANA

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:13.244
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS AS

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:17.114
THE CONTEXT FOR THE OUR

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.983

THE LONG TERM OTHERWISE WERE

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:26.591
REALLY WASTING AN ENORMOUS

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.793
AMOUNT OF MONEY- SO I WOULD

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.962
REALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM. OF

00:35:31.028 --> 00:35:34.131

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:12.983
TIME AND WE DON'T HAVE PERFECT

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:16.420
INFORMATION OVER A TEN YEAR-

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:19.090
TEN YEAR PLANNING HORIZON- SO

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.925
WE'RE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.960
AVAILABLE INFORMATION THAT WE

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:25.896
HAVE A BETTER FACILITY. WELL I

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.364
THINK THAT'S THE SAME THING

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:31.535
THAT ANY DEPARTMENT OR- YOU

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:33.070
KNOW ANY DEPARTMENT GOES

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:34.238
THROUGH IS WE DON'T HAVE

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:36.173
PERFECT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.441
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:39.243
NEXT. FEW MONTHS A FEW YEARS

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.644
BUT WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.680
WE CAN- AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:45.382
NEEDS THIS KIND OF INFORMATION.

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:53.858
OF SO AT. MAYBE THE L. A. O.

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.192
COULD COMMENT ON WHAT YOU JUST

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:58.362
SAID RIGHT NOW MISS CAITLYN

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.233
AMOENUS- O'NEILL- SO TOTALLY-

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.401
YOUR POINT CENTER DORADO ABOUT.

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:07.037
HOW JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:40:07.104 --> 00:40:08.005
PERFECT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.241
TO. I MEAN WE CAN'T PLAN FOR

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:12.710
THE FUTURE WE THAT CERTAINLY

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.813
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- IN FACT.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:18.949
THERE'S UNCERTAINTY AND POINT

00:40:19.016 --> 00:40:21.418
IN TIME INFORMATION IS YOURS

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:22.586
ALL THE TIME IN STRATEGIC

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:25.356
PLANNING PROCESSES SO- WE

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:27.558
CERTAINLY DON'T SEE THAT AS A

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:30.127
BARRIER TO. DOINGS TO ENGAGING

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:31.629
IN STRATEGIC PLANNING AROUND

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:33.864
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- ON THE

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:38.402
DEPARTMENT'S ARGUMENT THAT-

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.371
IDENTIFYING PRISONS WAY TO

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:42.339
PRESENT STAFFING CHALLENGES AND

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.308
OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES WE ALSO

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.143
I DON'T SEE THIS AS PROHIBITIVE

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.846
TO- PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:51.282
WITH INFORMATION ABOUT- LONG

00:40:51.348 --> 00:40:53.584
TERM PLANS FOR THE FACILITY SO

00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:54.318
THAT THEY CAN MAKE INFORMED

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:56.120
DECISIONS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.823
PROJECTS. AND WE THINK THAT IT

00:40:58.889 --> 00:41:01.792
COULD IN FACT- I MEAN GIVEN THE

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:02.927
POPULATION DECLINE THE

00:41:02.993 --> 00:41:05.429
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT A PRISON IS

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.364
SCHEDULED TO BE CLOSED AT LEAST

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.233
ONE. STAFF OUT THERE ARE

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.701
ALREADY PROBABLY WONDERING IF

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:12.770
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE PRESENT-

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:14.138
WHICH CAN BE CREATING CERTAIN

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:16.240
AMOUNT OF ANXIETY SO TO THE

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.741
EXTENT WE COULD THEY COULD IN

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.877
FACT BE A BENEFIT TO STAFF THEY

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.847
HAVE THE ABILITY- THEIR LIVES.

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:24.081
KNOWING THAT THEY MIGHT BE

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.182
MOVING PRESENCE AT SOME POINT

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.117
IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S JUST A

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:30.321
DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE. TO TAKE

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:33.324
ON THAT THAT ARGUMENT- I JUST

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.727
HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS-

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:39.663
BUT YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING- OR

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.466
MAYBE I JUST THOUGHT YOU SAID-

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:46.170
OF A PRIORITY BY INSTITUTION-

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:48.239

BY IN INSTITUTION OR DID I HEAR

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.209

THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:13.230
QUESTION- THAT'S SO AS- HAS

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:15.165
BEEN MENTIONING A FEW TIMES WE

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:18.135
DO HAVE THE LIST OF THE ONE

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.170
BILLION DOLLARS OF- AT DEFERRED

CERTAINLY- HAVE THAT LIST LIST

00:42:41.358 --> 00:42:44.795
PROVIDED. OKAY THAT'S A

00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:46.230
MAINTENANCE LIST THE DEFERRED

FOR THE BILLION DOLLARS. ARE

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.807
THERE OTHERS YOU SAID FOR THE

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.642
BALL DOLLARS AT I'M NOT SURE

00:42:58.709 --> 00:42:59.944
YOU'RE REFERRING TO ONE BILLION

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.179
DOLLARS I'VE HEARD THIRTEEN

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:03.681
BILLION DOLLARS- DIFFERENT

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.516
NUMBERS SO WHAT ARE YOU

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:08.319
REFERRING TO. CORRECT SO THE

00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:11.755
BILLION DOLLARS LAST- IS

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:15.626
REPRESENTS A LIST OF. YOU KNOW

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:18.562
PROJECTS OR THAT NEED DEFERRED

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:21.098
MAINTENANCE THAT HAVE A SCOPE

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:24.969
RELATED TO THEM- AT THE

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:25.569
THIRTEEN BILLION BILLION

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:30.374
DOLLARS IS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT-

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.942
POTENTIALLY THE FACILITIES

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:34.979
COULD NEED- BUT THERE AREN'T

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:37.614
SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.451
BEEN IDENTIFIED BEHIND THE

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:41.018
THIRTEEN BUT BILLION DOLLAR

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:45.389
LESS. I'LL OPEN IT UP TO MY

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:50.194
COLLEAGUES. SIR NEWMAN FOR

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:53.330
SECRETARY ZINKE. THANK YOU

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:57.935
THINK MANAGER- IS REALLY A

00:43:58.002 --> 00:44:00.604
QUESTION I THINK. FOR THE L. A.

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:05.609
O. IT IS PRETTY CLEAR WHEN WE

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:07.444
SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO PRISON

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:09.913
SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE YOU KNOW

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.017
THAT WE HAVE- I THINK IT'S-

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.852
JUST BASIC UNREFUTED FACTS ON

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:16.854
THE TABLE THOSE. THOSE ARE

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.256
SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE AND I

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.824
THINK IF WE PRESSED WE COULD.

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:24.595
WE GET CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING-

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.597
TIMELINE AND THINGS LIKE THAT

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:29.466
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU USE THE TERM

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:31.268
LIKELY SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE.

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:33.003
WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.039
DEFINITION OF THAT I MEAN WHAT

00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:37.474
WHAT IS YOUR WORKING DEFINITION

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:39.943
I DON'T KNOW- I MEAN I KNOW

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.545
WHAT IT MEANS IS IN LAYPERSON'S

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.980
TERMS THAT FOR SOMEBODY

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:45.449
SOMEWHERE IS MANDATORY NATION

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:49.653
THAT- MORE PRISONS ARE IN THAT

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.657
CATEGORY I'M JUST WONDERING.

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.059
WHAT'S BEHIND THAT WHAT WHAT

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:58.028
INSPIRES THAT PHRASEOLOGY

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:03.434
LIKELY SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.303
THIS IS CAN'T FIND ANY ALL. HE

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.272
WE DIDN'T WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.074
ANY PRISONS BEYOND DUPLICATION

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.308
OR INSTITUTION AT THIS POINT

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.509
HAVE SPECIFICALLY BEEN

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:16.747
SCHEDULED FOR CLOSURE- WE'RE-

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.749
BEGIN TO. AND PRISONS THAT ARE

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.517
LIKELY CANDIDATES FORECLOSURE

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:23.487
AND BY THAT WE MEAN- PRISONS

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:26.623
WHERE THE STATE COULD CLOSE

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.859
DOWN WITHOUT CREATING MAJOR

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:31.195
OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS THAT WOULD

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.431
BE COSTLY OR- VERY DIFFICULT

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:38.302
TO. DEAL WITH IN OTHER WORDS-

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:39.937
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE CLOSE

00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:43.707
THE PRISON THAT- RELIED ON A

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:45.442
NEIGHBORING PRESENT IF PROVIDE

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:48.245
KEY SERVICES FOR IT OUR SITE IS

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:49.613
A PRIVILEGE THE STATE CLOSE THE

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.681
PRISON THAT WHAT'S PROVIDING

00:45:50.747 --> 00:45:51.815
KEY SERVICES TO A NEIGHBORING

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.617
PRESIDENT THAT WOULD BE- A

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.119
CHALLENGE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:55.919
DEALT WITH IT WOULD HAVE TO

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:58.555
SHIFT. THAT SERVICE TWO OF THE

00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.990
OTHER PRESENT WHICH ISN'T

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.358
NECESSARILY INSURMOUNTABLE BUT

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.559
IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.695
ABOUT- OTHER PRISONS HAVE KEY

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.196
MEDICAL MISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE SO

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.064
THE STATE COULDN'T CLOSE AND

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:09.666
WITHOUT- SHIFTING OUR DATA

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.468
MEDICAL CAPACITY SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:13.370
IN THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER CRITERIA

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:18.142
WE. LOOKED AT IS- THERE THERE

00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:21.011
BECAUSE- TIONAL. AND IN NEEDS

00:46:21.078 --> 00:46:23.447
RELATIVE TO THEIR- INNATE

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.950
CAPACITY SO THAT'S SORT OF A-

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:28.252
ROUGH MEASURES YOU CAN THINK OF

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:28.952
IS SORT OF THE COST

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:31.522
EFFECTIVENESS OR- OF OFTEN

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.956
CONTINUING TO OPERATE THAT

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:35.192
PRISON- AND THEN A THIRD

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:37.561
CRITERIA ONE MIGHT CONSIDER IS

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:39.096
THE LOCATION OF THE PRISONS IN

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:40.964
SOME CASES. IT CAN BE HARD FOR

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.500
CDCR TO RECRUIT RECRUIT AND

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:46.370
RETAIN STAFF- PARTICULARLY

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:48.038
MEDICAL STAFF IN SOME CASES

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.040
PACKED AT PRISON THAT ARE IN

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:52.910
VERY REMOTE AREAS- THOSE ARE

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:54.311
THREE FACTORS THAT WE

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:56.747
CONSIDERED WHEN WE- IDENTIFIED

00:46:56.813 --> 00:46:58.282
OUR PRELIMINARY LIST OF PRISONS

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.116
BUT THERE CERTAINLY OTHER

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.919
FACTORS. THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.121
COULD CONSIDER- WE ALSO NOTE

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:07.024
THAT- IN WE NOTED IN OUR REPORT

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.592
ON PRISON INFRASTRUTURE WHICH

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.794
WE RELEASED LAST YEAR THAT- THE

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:12.496
ADMINISTRATION PROBABLY IS IN

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:16.066
THE BEST POSITION. TO IDENTIFY

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:17.067
THAT. PRISONS ARE THE STRONG

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:19.102
CAN'T FOR CLOSURE GIVEN THAT

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.638
IT'S FAR MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:25.142
DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND- IN

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.010
UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH

00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:30.981
OF THE PRESENCE. YOUR QUESTION.

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:33.717
IT HELPS A LOT AND I APOLOGIZE.

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:34.351
FOR MISS CHARACTERSIN THE

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.819
PHRASE WITH LIKELY CANDIDATES

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:37.988
FOR CLOSURE WOULD BE. I THINK

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.756
THE WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.792
A RIGHT WAY TO. CHARACTERIZE

WHERE I'M GOING WITH THAT

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:03.200
THAT'S SURE SURE IN MY OPINION.

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:03.734
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.404
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE OR- IF

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.906
THE SYSTEM IS THE CDC OURS

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:11.808
PROVIDING THAT KIND OF DETAIL

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:14.010
INEXORABLY. IN A GO BACK TO

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:15.645
MISTER ALAN ASKING P. AS A KIND

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.914

YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. SO THAT IS

00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:22.652
EXACTLY THE KIND OF INFORMATION

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.821
THE KIND OF ASSESSMENT THAT. WE

00:50:24.888 --> 00:50:27.290
THINK THAT THE- DEPARTMENT

00:50:27.357 --> 00:50:28.492
NEEDS TO DO AND NEEDS TO

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:31.395
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE. THE

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.563
CONSULTANT THAT DID AN IN DEPTH

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.665
STUDY OF THE TWELVE OLDEST

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:39.870
PRISONS DID- PROVIDE A LIST A

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.471
SPECIFIC LIST OF RECOMMENDED

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:44.808
PROJECTS. HOWEVER AND ALSO A

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.877
PRIORITIZATION ORDER- HOWEVER

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:49.413
IT'S NOT CLEAR NECESSARILY THAT

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.782
THE STATE AS YOU POINT OUT.

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:53.884
NEEDS TO PURSUE. ROGER X. FOR

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.620
EXAMPLE WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.155
GIVEN SORT OF THE INDUSTRY

00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:00.991
PRACTICES AND STANDARDS THE IF

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.592
THERE WAS A FACILITY MADE OF

00:51:02.659 --> 00:51:03.927
WOOD OF WHICH THE STATE HAS A

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:06.329
NUMBER OF- INMATE HOUSING UNITS

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.697
THAT ARE KIND OF LIKE WOODEN

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:11.668
BARRACKS- THAT THE- CONSULTANT

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.170
AUTOMATICALLY RECOMMENDED

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.372
REBUILDING THOSE FACILITIES. SO

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:17.040
THAT'S A CASE WHERE IT PERHAPS

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.442
THE STATE WOULD COME TO A

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:19.676
DIFFERENT CONCLUSION ABOUT THE

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:20.777
NEED TO REBUILD THAT FACILITY

00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:23.580
AND CDC OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:25.248
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE OF COURSE

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.750
DEALING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:28.885
WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:31.154
THEY WOULD. IT WOULD BE

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:33.256
IMPORTANT FOR AND DIE

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.891
DEPARTMENT ESSENTIALLY IS WHAT

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:35.859
I'M SAYING TO REVIEW THOSE

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:37.227
RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO LOOK AT

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:38.628
THE OTHER PRESENTS. AND SAY

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:41.665
OKAY WHAT IS REALLY IMPACTING-

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:45.302
PEOPLE'S. MY SAFETY AND

00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:46.269
OPERATIONS OF THE PRISON AND

00:51:46.336 --> 00:51:47.304
WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED TO

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.773
ADDRESS- FIRST ETCETERA SO THAT

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.042
IS AN EXERCISE THAT WE THINK IS

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:53.510
IMPORTANT TO THIS OVERALL

00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:55.445
PRISON INFRASTRUCTURE

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:57.280
IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. IS IT

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:58.949
FAIR TO SAY THAT AT SOME POINT

00:51:59.015 --> 00:52:02.419
WERE- EXCEEDING THE SCOPE OF

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.154
WHAT THE L. A- WOULD NORMALLY

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:05.789
DO IN IN MAY BE A FAILURE

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.891
ANALYSIS- OR AN ENGINEERING

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.359
ANALYSIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT IN

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:12.796
OUTSIDE OF CDC OR IS UNABLE TO

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.598

POSSIBILITY A POSSIBILITY THAT.

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:24.674
WE GO DOWN THAT PATH TO GET

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:27.143
THAT KIND OF DETAIL. WE CAN

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.046

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:43.073
FOR FEEDBACK- EVEN FROM CDCR I

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:45.375
ASKED HIM IN PART BECAUSE IF

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:48.078
THERE ARE. IN THE ADAPTIVE

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:49.546
REUSES FOR PRISONS THAT GO

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:52.449
BEYOND. THIS AGENCY BEYOND CDC

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:56.853
ARE- SHOULD WE WANT TO KNOW

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.621
THAT THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT

00:55:58.688 --> 00:55:59.422
TRYING TO BRING THIS BACK TO

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:01.091
MAINTENANCE AGAIN IT MAKES A

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:02.492
LOT MORE SENSE TO PUT A ROOF ON

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.394
A BUILDING THAT ANOTHER AGENCY

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:05.862
OR DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE STATE

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:08.932
HAS AN INTEREST IN- OR IS BEING

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.233
NO SURPLUS TO SOMEBODY WHO

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.801
NEEDS A BUILDING WITH A ROOF ON

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:12.869
IT SO THAT THAT'S WHERE I'M

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:15.472
GOING I CAN TALK TO MORE- AS

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:18.108
YOU SUGGESTED. OFFICE TO OFFICE

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:19.909
SO TO WIN THE TIE UP THE WHOLE-

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.177
COMMITTEE WITH THIS I DON'T

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.979
KNOW IF ANY OF WHAT I JUST

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:26.349
ASKED- I DO WANT TO DENY- THIS

00:56:26.416 --> 00:56:27.717
ROMAN IS IT WILL BE OPPORTUNITY

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.353
TO. TO HE TO MAKE A BRIEF

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.021
RESPONSE TO ANY OF THAT OF

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:33.656
MEDICARE IF THAT'S OKAY WITH

00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:37.794
YOU SURE. STONE JUST NAMING

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:39.429
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN I

00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:40.363
JUST WANTED TO KIND OF

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.965
HIGHLIGHT IT IT'S MORE THAN

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:43.767
JUST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.001
MINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.136
CONSIDER ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:47.537
REASONS TO CLOSE IT IT'S A BIG

00:56:47.604 --> 00:56:49.372
COMPONENT BUT THERE ARE ALSO

00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:51.407
OTHER ISSUES- THANK WHEN FOR

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:52.509
EXAMPLE WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:54.778
LA- BUT HAS A VERY SPECIALIZED

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.146
POPULATION IN HOUSING GET

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:58.114
THROWING ME IN AND ALSO HAS

00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:00.049
EXTREMELY GOOD- PROGRAMMING FOR

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:01.618
INMATES AVAILABLE THERE BECAUSE

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:02.685
OF ITS PROXIMITY IN THE BAY

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:05.155
AREA- HAVE A LOT OF STAFFING

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:06.990
OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AGAIN

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:08.691
BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE LOCATION

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.360
SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:11.828
INVOLVED BEYOND JUST

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.163
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR THE

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:17.066
COST TO KEEP. THE FACILITY

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:18.234
OPERATING. AS FAR AS THE SENATE

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:20.537
QUESTION REGARD. EVENTUALLY YOU

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:22.572
FOR EVENTUAL TO. ON THE ADMIN.

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.274
IS CONSIDERING OPTIONS WHICH IS

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.709
WHY AS PART OF THAT- FUNDING

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.144
FOR DUPLICATION INSTITUTE THIS

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.346
YEAR WE'RE PROPOSING. TO

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:31.314
MAINTAIN ASPECTS CERTAIN

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.016
MINIMUM NUMBER OF THE CITY

00:57:33.082 --> 00:57:34.617
STAFF AT THE PLANT OPERATIONS

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:35.685
AT THE FACILITY CAN BE

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.821
MAINTAINED IN WORKING ORDER. AS

00:57:37.887 --> 00:57:38.688
WE WORK TOWARDS FINAL

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.256
DISPOSITION INTENTIONAL SURPLUS

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.225
OR OTHER OPTIONS FOR USE. I'M

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.194
SO EVEN IF WE TO CLOSE A PRISON

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.796
IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN-

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.832
FACILITIES AT THAT INSTITUTION

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:51.634
AND- FACILITY- AND AS SENATOR

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.136
PER CASE YOU MENTIONED- ARE.

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.104
ENTERTAINING BUT HE SAID HE WAS

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:56.739
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND OFTEN

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:58.775
CASES YEAH EMPHASIZE FIRE LIFE

00:57:58.842 --> 00:58:00.410
SAFETY ISSUES. THINGS LIKE

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.111
COLLAPSING ROOFS OR FIRE

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.179
SUPPRESSION SYSTEMS THESE ARE

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.914
OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:05.915
REALLY CAN'T BE JUST

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.784
MAINTAINED. AS A POTENTIAL

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.118
CLOSURE SEVERAL YEARS OFFICE

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:11.621
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY IT'S JUST

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:13.089
TOO PROBLEMATIC FOR LIKE LEON

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.225
LITIGATION. FOR OBVIOUSLY THE

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:21.731
HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STAFF. AND

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:22.365
INMATES AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS.

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:24.834
I WANNA- SAY. HI KAREN I'M SURE

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:25.602
MY COLLEAGUES CARED DEEPLY

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:28.271
ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.241
THE STAFF IN THESE PRISONS OF

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:34.177
THE OF POPULATION THOSE MEN AND

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.311
WOMEN WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:38.348
THEM. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:39.315
NINE ARE PUTTING US IN THE

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:41.017
POSITION OF EVALUATING WHETHER

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:43.152
OR NOT WE SHOULD DO THE REPAIRS

00:58:43.219 --> 00:58:44.120
OR THE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED-

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.823
OUTLINED THIS IS ABOUT HAVING A

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.092
MORE RESPONSIBLE APPROACH TO

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:51.027
THOSE NEEDS FULFILLING THE

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:53.396
NEEDS OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN

00:58:53.463 --> 00:58:55.832
ARE INSIDE THE PRISONS BUT IT'S

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:58.001
ALSO A RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE

00:58:58.067 --> 00:59:00.203
HAVE AS A AS A LEGISLATURE. AND

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.238
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:04.307
THAT WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

00:59:04.374 --> 00:59:06.376
THESE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.744
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:09.746
COMMITTED TO A LONG TERM PRISON

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:13.249
CLOSURE PLAN OF THE THAT WE

00:59:13.316 --> 00:59:15.451
AVOID SCENARIOS IN WHICH WE ARE

00:59:15.518 --> 00:59:17.387
MAKING UNNECESSARY INVESTMENTS

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:18.688
AND WE UNDERSTAND WHY CERTAIN

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.623
PROJECTS ARE BEING CHOSEN OVER

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:25.828
OTHERS- SO- WE HAVE GOT TO GET

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.997
TO GOT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND

00:59:28.064 --> 00:59:29.565
EVERYTHING THAT YOU IDENTIFY

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.734
MISTER ADLEMAN ABOUT ALL THE

00:59:31.801 --> 00:59:34.737
CONSIDERATIONS FINE. LET'S PUT

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.472
THOSE CONSIDERATIONS INTO A

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:38.741
PLAN AND MOVE US ALL FORWARD

00:59:38.808 --> 00:59:41.577
BUT WE ARE VERY MUCH LACKING IN

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:44.180
THE KIND OF- INFORMATION THAT

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.182
WE NEED THE STRATEGY THAT WE

00:59:46.249 --> 00:59:47.517
MADE AND THE KIND OF

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:48.952
INFORMATION AND STRATEGY THAT

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:50.787
WE WOULD EXPECT FROM ANY

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:54.857
DEPARTMENT OF SO WITH THAT I

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.859
JUST THE- YES I'M SORRY. YES

00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:59.629
YES OF COURSE THE CENTER NEWMAN.

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.230
AND I APOLOGIZE SO I MY

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.865
QUESTION PROBABLY DENTURES FOR

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.300
SOME OF THE DIMENSIONS OF

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.035
CENTER CRETACEOUS QUESTION-

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:07.036
THERE ARE A COUPLE POSTED

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.471
MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE TWO

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.139
NUMBERS FOR DEFERRED

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:11.174
MAINTENANCE THERE'S A BILLION

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.809
DOLLAR. SO FRAZIER RIGHT TO

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.077
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY DIFFERENT

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:15.645
MANAGE PROJECTS BUT THERE'S A

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.413
MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF THIRTEEN

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.715
BILLION DOLLARS SO I I'D BE

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.150
CURIOUS AS TO- WHAT'S THE

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.785
SPREAD BETWEEN WHAT'S YOUR WHAT

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:26.356
EXPLAINS THAT VARIANCE. AND HOW

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.124
OR HAVE TO WE HAVEN'T SEEN OUR

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.959
NEW TO THIS OBVIOUSLY AND SO I

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.828
DO APPRECIATE THE OFFER OF A

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:32.862
SUMMARY OF THOSE PROJECTS

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.031
VERTICALLY AS THEY ARE

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.033
ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC PRISONS-

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.801
BUT IS IT POSSIBLE AS WELL OR

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:40.770
IS BECAUSE IT EXIST- THAT THAT

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.605
REMAINDER OF. TWELVE BILLION

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:44.073
DOLLARS THE VARIANCES THAT ALSO

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.375
ATTRIBUTED TO SPECIFIC PRESENCE

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.876
BECAUSE TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:47.910
QUESTIONS THERE'S CLEARLY A

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.213
VERY COMPLICATED ASSESSMENT

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:51.848
MATRIX THAT IS NECESSARY TO

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:54.017
MAKE DECISIONS OVER EXTENDED

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.852
PERIOD OF TIME- AND THIS WOULD

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.253
BE PROBABLY WHERE I WOULD START

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.888
SO AT THAT THE FAR END OF

01:00:58.955 --> 01:00:59.856
THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THOSE

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.491
ARE PROBABLY. GOOD TO HAVE

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.893
PROJECTS BUT NOT NECESSARY- BUT

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.761
THAT ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:06.062
THRESHOLD SEEMS PRETTY

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:09.198
ARBITRARY SO- AS IT CREEPS INTO

01:01:09.265 --> 01:01:10.266
YOU KNOW THAT SECOND HALF OF

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.567
THE THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:13.069
YOU CAN SEEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME-

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.470
THOSE PROJECTS MIGHT BECOME

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.838
MORE URGENT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:16.806
THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.408
HELPFUL. IN MAKING THESE SORTS

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.976
OF JUDGMENTS SO IF YOU COULD

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:23.112
SPEAK TO THAT- I GUESS- MISTER

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:29.552
LEAVE FIRST- BE HELPFUL FOR US.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:34.791
CERTAINLY SO PERHAPS THAT ON-

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.793
YEAH I THINK YOU CAN IT BIG

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.261
CORRECTLY THAT THE BILLION I

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.596
REPRESENTS A PROJECTS AT-

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:42.832
INDIVIDUAL PERSONS FOR WHICH WE

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:45.635
HAVE HAVE A SCOPE FOR THIRTEEN

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:51.240
BILLION DOLLARS IS MORE A- A-

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:52.775
OKAY BASED ON DISABILITY

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:55.878
CONDITIONS AND- BUT THERE ARE

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.749
NO SPECIFIC PROJECTS- LINES-

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:01.984
THE FACT THAT NUMBER- WE KNOW

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.387
WE HAVE A LOT OF. AGING

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:09.492
SYSTEMS- IN IN THE PRISONS AND-

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.527
YOU KNOW I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.896
ABOUT THE PROCESS OF HOW

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:16.632
PROJECTS GET INTO GET INTO THE

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.701
USE SO THIS REALLY STARTS IN

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.837
THE FIELD AT EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:24.574
INSTITUTIONS. AND IS OVERSEEN

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.108
BY THE CORRECTIONAL PLANT

01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:28.077
MANAGERS- AND THE WARDENS AND

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.779
THEIR MAGIC MANAGEMENT TEAMS

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.881
HAVE DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITY

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.449
FOR OVERSEEING SAFE AND

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:36.252
FUNCTIONAL FACILITIES. I EACH-

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.955
INSTITUTION HAS A M. I MEAN

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:42.692
IT'S BUDGET- WHICH HAD HAS BEEN

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:46.062
A GRANTED IT- IN RECENT YEARS-

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:47.663
WHICH IT WILL BE VERY

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.600
IMPORTANT- GOING FORWARD- SO

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.968
THAT MORE PROBLEMS CAN BE

01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:53.970
ADDRESSED EARLIER IN THEIR

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:57.940
LIFECYCLE TO AVOID- MAJOR.

01:02:58.007 --> 01:03:02.011

DO WE WANT TO CREATE A GREATER

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.770
EMPHASIS ON FOR EXAMPLE

WITH- MORE REHABILITATIVE

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.576
MINDSET IN PLACE COULD WE

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:56.278

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:09.905
I'M SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.074
BIT- TOO SIMPLISTIC TO SIMPLY

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:20.883
LOOK AT THE POPULATION. TRENDS

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:21.450
AND SAY WELL THE POP IS DOWN

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:22.851
TODAY AND WE EXPECT TO BE DOWN

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:24.653
THE FUTURE WE SHOULD BE. AND

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.755
IDENTIFY PRISONS FOR CLOSURE-

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:27.556
WE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT SHE

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:29.658
ACTUALLY HAVE AND I IS BY TO BE.

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:30.259
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:31.827
OUR PRISONS STATE- AND WE HAVE.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.662
FOR THE JUST WITHIN THOSE

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.064
INSTITUTIONS. ARE IN OBVIOUSLY

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.198
CALL PRISON MAKES THAT MUCH

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.866
MORE. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:39.468
SOMETHING THAT'S AT THE TOP OF

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.071
OUR- FIVE THINKING IT AS WE

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.572
WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.674
WHAT THE- JUSTIN SHOULD BE TO

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.443
PRISON CAPACITY IN THE FUTURE.

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:48.510
THE OTHER THING I DO WANT TO

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:52.348
MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR IS THAT

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.182
THE PRACTICE OF. PROJECTING

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.750
WHAT THE- POPULATION BE IN THE

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:58.387
FUTURE- IS A VERY DIFFICULT

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:01.423
ONE- IT APARTMENTS I HAS A VERY

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.725
SOPHISTICATED MODEL AND THEY'RE

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:03.959
VERY GOOD AT PREDICTING WHAT

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:05.995
THE POPULATION WILL BE. ONE OR

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:07.496
TWO YEARS IN THE FUTURE. BUT

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.731
ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THAT TIME

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:10.633
RISE IN THE START OF MY THREE

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:14.003
FOUR YEARS- FIVE YEARS. IT IS A

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:15.938
VERY DICEY PROPOSITION AND

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.172
THAT'S NOT AN INDICTMENT OF THE

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.707
DEPARTMENTS IT'S JUST A

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.376
REFLECTION IF YOU LOOK BACK YOU

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.711
KNOW OVER THE LAST. TEN FIFTEEN

01:11:22.778 --> 01:11:24.146

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:15.208
IT'S REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT

01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:17.711
WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:18.278

DEPARTMENT. AND IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:22.382
DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE SUGGESTS

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:23.850
THAT THE ADDITIONAL RESEARCHERS

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:25.919
HAVE HAD POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:27.988
DEPARTMENT'S OPERATIONS.

01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:30.857
HOWEVER AS FINANCED AS NOTED WE

01:45:30.924 --> 01:45:32.192
DO FIND THAT THAT THE

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:34.428
DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE FOR THAT

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.562
TEMPORARY FIELD OFFICE STAFF

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:37.497
REQUIRED AND ACCELERATE COSTS

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:39.099
AT ADDRESSING THE REAL ID

01:45:39.166 --> 01:45:41.168
WORKLOAD ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:43.637
ON SEVERAL FACTORS SOME OF

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:44.404
WHICH ARE FAIRLY UNSER AND

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.273
SOUTH. AND THESE FACTORS

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:48.375
INCLUDE POTENTIAL FEDERAL

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.010

GETTING A REAL ID IS LESS

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.530
NECESSARY BECAUSE FOLKS ARE

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:12.799
TRAVELING LESS. AND IT KIND OF

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.334

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:19.399
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MAYBE THIS

IS JUST KIND OF TO WALK ME

01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:23.203
THROUGH THIS BUT I KNOW RIGHT

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:25.605
NOW BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND

01:47:25.672 --> 01:47:26.873
THEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:31.111
GUIDANCES- WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE

01:47:31.178 --> 01:47:32.379
TO STAY HOME WE'RE SAYING

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:33.947
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:35.549
NOW TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:39.419
THIS THE SPREAD- BUT YET ON THE

01:47:39.486 --> 01:47:41.254
OTHER HAND ARE I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:45.125
AGGRESSIVE ARE YOUR EFFORTS ARE

01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:47.460
YOU TRYING TO GET THEM TO GO IN

01:47:47.527 --> 01:47:50.063
AND GET THEIR REAL ID. BECAUSE

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:53.633

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:54.534
DEADLINE RIGHT FROM THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT- I KNOW HOW THIS IS

01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:58.805
ALL WORKING NOW IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:02.142
REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO-

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:03.743
PUSHING PEOPLE PEOPLE TO GO IN

01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:06.246
BUT THEN OF KNOWING THAT THAT'S

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:07.747
NOT WHAT WE WANT IN GENERAL

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:10.250
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED- SO

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:10.984
THAT'S JUST ONE IF YOU COULD

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:13.019
COMMENT ON THAT OF THE OTHER

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:17.757
IS- I'M REALLY. CONCERNED-

01:48:17.824 --> 01:48:20.026
ABOUT NOT ONLY PAST EXPERIENCES

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:24.331
WITH THE DM B. R. BUT- THE

01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:26.166
NUMBER IN THE MILLIONS OF

01:48:26.233 --> 01:48:28.668
PEOPLE ARE. AND KNOW EXACTLY

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:30.871
WHAT YOU EXPECT WHAT HOW MANY

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:32.472
MILLION PEAK MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:35.342
YOU EXPECT TO. OF PROCESS

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.310
BETWEEN NOW AND OCTOBER

01:48:37.377 --> 01:48:39.646
APPROXIMATELY OCTOBER BUT AS

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:42.916
THE PANDEMIC LOOSENS UP GOD

01:48:42.983 --> 01:48:44.885
WILLING. ALL ON THE

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:46.786
RESTRICTIONS MORE PEOPLE WILL

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:48.321
WANT TO TRAVEL BILL REALIZE

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.590
THAT THEY NEED A REAL ID. AND

01:48:50.657 --> 01:48:52.492
THEN THEY'LL START OF FLOODING

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:54.461
SO I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:57.063
ABOUT. ARE THESE RESOURCES

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:59.499
GOING TO MEET THE DEMAND. OF

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:00.967
THAT WE'RE EXPECTING FOR REAL

01:49:01.034 --> 01:49:05.338
ID CUSTOMERS- WE HAVE TO AVOID

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.040
YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF A WAIT

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:09.576
LINE- CRISIS. AND DO YOU HAVE

01:49:09.643 --> 01:49:12.946
THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:16.983
TO KEEP UP WITH THAT DEMAND.

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.318
YES THANK YOU MEDICARE'S A

ABOUT YOU KNOW KIND OF IS IT A

01:49:24.457 --> 01:49:26.359
GOOD IDEA TO PULL PEOPLE INTO

01:49:26.426 --> 01:49:27.160
THE CURRENT PERIOD WHEN WE'RE

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:28.395
TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE.

01:49:28.461 --> 01:49:30.196
SEPARATED IN HAND HOW SOCIAL

01:49:30.263 --> 01:49:31.965
DISTANCING I WOULD CONCUR WITH

01:49:32.032 --> 01:49:33.400
YOU THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:34.067
THAT WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:35.268
ATTACKING RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:37.103
THE DEADLINE FROM THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT IS STILL OCTOBER

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:40.540
FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:41.808
THAT IS A HARD STOP AT THIS

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:44.077
MOMENT HOW BAHRAINI CHANGE AND

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.179
IN THAT IN THAT GOAL SO AT SOME

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:47.147
POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:48.882
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME INTO

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:49.916
THE OFFICE WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:49:49.983 --> 01:49:51.484
THOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:52.319
OF TIME IT'S BEEN IN THE

01:49:52.385 --> 01:49:53.853
OFFICE. YOUR NUMBER OF ACTIVE

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.422
HE HEARD THE SO CALLED RAD V.

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:57.524
P. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:58.692
PROPERLY BRANDING THAT BUT

01:49:58.758 --> 01:50:00.060
REALLY WHAT THAT DOES IS ALLOWS

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.194
CUSTOMERS TO DO THEIR

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:02.729
PREPARATION WORK AT HOME ALLOWS

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.531
HIM TO UPLOAD THEIR DOCUMENTS

01:50:04.597 --> 01:50:06.132
BE PRECHECK SO TO SPEAK TO MAKE

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:07.367
SURE THE DOCUMENTS ARE.

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.302
COMPLETE AND VALID FOR- FOR THE

01:50:09.369 --> 01:50:10.603
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE SO WHEN THEY

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:12.539
DO COME INTO THE OFFICE YEAH

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:13.340
THEY'RE THEY'RE STOP THEIR

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:14.507
THEIR STAY THERE COULD BE

01:50:14.574 --> 01:50:16.376
EXPEDITED SO COULD MINIMIZE THE

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:17.377
AMOUNT OF EXPOSURE THEY WOULD

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:19.779
HAVE. SO WE ARE TAKING BACK FOR

01:50:19.846 --> 01:50:21.581
THE TECHNOLOGY QUESTION YOU HE

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:22.949
ENDED WITH WE HAVE TAKEN A

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.084
NUMBER OF STEPS OVER THE PAST

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:26.686
SEVERAL MONTHS TO REALLY FOCUS

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:28.588
ON MINIMIZING THE THAT TOUCHES

01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:30.256
WE HAVE IN THE OFFICE TRYING TO

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.992
GO TOWARDS A- A NO TOUCH

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.159
EXPERIENCE WHICH IS KIND OF THE

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:36.062
NORM TODAY- IN. IN RETAIL I

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:36.830

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:42.635
TOUCH PROCESS TODAY SO THERE'S

01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:44.037
OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THAT TO

01:50:44.104 --> 01:50:45.772
YOU KNOW MAYBE 50% MAYBE

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.007
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. DEPENDING

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:48.742
ON OUR ABILITY TO REACH THAT

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:50.243
POPULATION WHICH IS PART OF THE

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:51.611
CHALLENGE SO THAT YOUR QUESTION

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:52.846
DO WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.014
GET OUT PEOPLE CROWDED IN

EMPLOYEES. IT'S NOT SAFER FOR

01:50:58.084 --> 01:50:59.986
THE PUBLIC BUT WE MAY NOT HAVE

MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PREPARE

01:51:04.657 --> 01:51:05.992
FOR THAT EVENTUALITY IF IT'S

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.360
GOING TO STILL BE THIS YEAR. TO

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:08.828
MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THAT SAFELY

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:11.031
