AJ ARE FORTY EIGHT AT BILLS ON CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CALL FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RESPECT THE CFPB EASE LIKE A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU'S. INDEPENDENCE WITH THE RESEARCH REP WITH THE RESOLUTION CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A LEADER IN DEFENDING. A FULLY FUNCTIONING AND INDEPENDENT CFPB THE CFPB IS MISSION MUST CONTINUE TO BE CENTERED ON CONSUMERS ITS LEADERSHIP MUST ALSO HAVE DEEP EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS HOLDING CORPORATION THE COUNT. ACCOUNTABLE IN KEEPING THE AGENCY ACCOUNTABLE TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. BY HOLDING PREDATORY LENDERS AND ABUSIVE FINANCIAL COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE THE CFPB HELPS TO ENSURE A FAIR AND MORE THRIVING ECONOMY FOR ALL PEOPLE. THIS RESOLUTION AFFIRMS CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECT OFFEND CONSUMERS FROM PREDATORY PRACTICES AND ABUSES IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR BY SUPPORTING A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT CFPB. IN A TIME OF INCREASING ECONOMIC INEQUALITY THE CFPB IS A CRITICAL REGULATORY AGENCIES SERVING AMERICANS WHO ARE VULNERABLE TO FINANCIAL ABUSE WHILE HOLDING FINANCIAL COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE.

TO PROLIFERATE IN THE VERY VERY POWERFUL FINANCIAL SECTOR OF THE CPB IS MISSION IS TO IDENTIFY THESE PRACTICES AND FORCED A LOT OF STOP ILLEGAL ACTS AND SEEK COMPENSATION FOR CONSUMERS WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED. ON HELP GET RESULTS REAL RESULTS FOR CONSUMERS WHEN THEY FILE COMPLAINTS -- BUT WHEN THEY DEMAND JUSTICE FOR BEING WRONG IN THE SEVEN YEARS SINCE IT OPENED ITS DOORS THE CPB HAS PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN PROMOTING AND DEFENDING FAIRNESS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETPLACE HERE IN IN AMERICA.
