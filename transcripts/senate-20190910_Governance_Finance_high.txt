THE BUYING AND SELLING OF DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL BEFORE THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES COME TO THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZING ADDITIONAL SALES TAX INCREASES. IMPROVE EVEN MORE TAXES SO FOR THAT A SIGNATURE WERE OPPOSED WERE ALSO MEMBERS TROUBLED TODAY BY THE INCLUSION OF SANTA CRUZ METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DISTRICT INTO THE BILL. IT SEEMS LIKE IN MEMBERS I COULD BE READING THIS PROVISION WRONG BUT THE DISTRICT APPEARS TO BE EXEMPTING THEMSELVES FROM THE BRADLEY BURNS 2% SALES CAP ENTIRELY NOT JUST PROSPECTIVELY FOR FUTURE TAXES BUT ALSO RETROACTIVELY FOR SAY TAXES ALREADY APPROVED. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ACCURATE MR OR PERHAPS YOU ARE THE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO THAT IN A CLUB THOSE AND IF THAT'S- TRUE WE SEE NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS BECAUSE IT DIMINISHES LOCAL AGENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. AND MAKES IT LIKELY THAT EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE TAXES WILL BE PLACED ON THE BALLOT. AND TAXES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MOVED. CAT BEING IT TO GO BACK IN EXEMPTS THAT 2% AND PRETEND LIKE THIS TAXES DIDN'T EXIST DOESN'T SEEM REAL GOOD FOR VOTER APPROVAL. SOME WOULD ASK FOR NOVA.

WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME RIGHT RE INCREASE SALES TAX AUTHORIZATIONS ALL THE TIME FOR FUTURE PERSPECTIVE TAXES THAT ARE GONNA BE ON THE BALLOT. CELL AND ANY WE WOULD STILL BE OPPOSED TO THAT BUT THIS IS THE FIRST I PERSONALLY SEEN A RETROACTIVE. SORT OF EXEMPTION OF A DISTRICT YOU KNOW AGAINST THE 2% CASH NOW YOU ARE CORRECTED THEY'RE NOT RETROACTIVE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. SHOULD THAT COMMISSION. TURN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. IF YOU HAVE ANY. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AND OR A CLOSING STATEMENT. ARM AS HE SAID WHEN I WAS HERE BEFORE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE TELLING LOCALS WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THEIR SALES TAX AND- THEN THE- NEWSOME ADMINISTRATION DECIDED RATHER THAN REYES.

ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL OF FOR THE BILL AND THE CONTENT OF THE BILL TRANSPARENCY IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THE DEVELOPERS ARE FULLY AWARE UP FRONT WHAT THE FEES ARE GOING TO BE BECAUSE IT IS TRULY. IMPACTFUL TO DEVELOPMENT TO GET THE PROCESS OR ACTUALLY THE PROCESS AND STILL GET TO THE ALMOST THE CLOTHES AND FIND OUT THERE'S ADDITIONAL FEES THAT WERE DISCLOSED AT THE BEGINNING. HAVING SAID THAT THERE ARE A THREE MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR IN WHICH CITIES CAN BEGIN TO COMPLY IF NOT ALREADY THE INFORMATION IS ALREADY THERE IT'S AVAILABLE IT'S JUST. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER AND PLACING IT ON THE WEBSITE WHICH IS NOT. A DIFFICULT HOWEVER APPROPRIATIONS DID YOU GET OUT THE ENFORCED MECHANISM SO THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO THIS TO THIS BILL OUTSIDE OF JUST REQUIRING THE CITY'S POST THEIR FREEZE ON THEIR WEBSITE.

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SAYING THE SAME THING UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS EVEN SAY THIS BUT NO STICK IN REGARDS TO THE FIND FEES RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE COMMITTED. IN OUR PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT IF WE NEED TO BE A LOOK AT SOME TYPE OF. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION TO BE A TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. EVERYONE ON BOARD I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN.

SO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE FORCED INTO THE BILL IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS I WANNA JUST REPEAT WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE MIGHT CONTINUING OBJECTION TO. WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHERE POLICY COMMITTEES THOROUGHLY BAT BILLS AND CRAFT AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING TOGETHER AND- I OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE TWO COMMITTEES WHICH ARE WORK TOGETHER. ON BILLS TOGETHER AND THEN WITH REALLY NO TRANSPARENCY POLICY CHANGES SIGNIFICANT ONES. ARE SHOVED INTO A BILL IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WITH NO POLICY ANALYSIS WITH NO STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ON WHICH THE TOP AND WITH NUMEROUS HOUSING BILLS THIS YEAR. AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A CREEK I'M A MEMBER THE LEGISLATURE WE ALL WENT TO THE STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD STRUCTURE AND IT HAPPENED HERE. IT IS A ROOM STILL IS A GOOD BILL.

I'M COMING UP IN TWENTY TWENTY SO AND GRATEFUL FOR THE COLLABORATION. PLEASE DISCUSSION ABOUT. YOU KNOW I LOOK THE DECISIVE IN A REAL DIFFICULT THING TO COME OUT. PERSONALLY I THINK. CITIES ALREADY DO THE SONG. THE THEY DO OF FEEL ARE NECESSARY. IF YOUR ASHES THE DESCRIBES WHAT THE FEES FOR ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IN YOUR BILL SO I THINK COULD BE PRETTY EASY TO IMPLEMENT THANKED OF. MAKING IT MORE TRANSPARENT IS A GOOD THING AND WE RECENTLY GOT THE REPORT FROM EACH CD AND I READ THE REPORT ON ON FEES THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THE BILL THAT CREATED THAT REPORT AND- I'M SURE THE NEXTYEAR WE'RE GOING TO DO A LOT OF THINGS TO IMPLEMENT. IN THAT REPORT CORRECT IS THAT. WORKING ON YOU KNOW FOR THE FUTURE I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING SAY. THE DIVIDE THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. AND WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT NEXT YEAR AND KEEP WORKING ON IT.

BUT MY AGE IN THIS HOUSE IS TO REPRESENT THE INSTITUTION. TO ME IT'S GOTTEN A MEN'S THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. WE ARE IN THE LAST FEW HOURS OF THIS LEGISLATURE THEY'RE OFTEN REASONS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE GERMANS WORKING ON A MATTER THAT'S BEEN PENDING FOR MONTHS AND IT TOOK AWHILE TO GET A DEAL TOGETHER AS WE KNOW. IT WOULD THAT OURSELVES TOGETHER. AND THE QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT'S THE COMPELLING REASON WHY IS THIS LEGISLATURE AT THIS TIME WHY THIS LATE WHAT HAPPENED. IS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I'M ASKING THE TOUGH QUESTIONS TO A DEAR FRIEND OF MY PARTY IS MANNERS NOT. THAT WE NOW HAVE TO HEAR THIS BILL NOW WE ALL IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO IN FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A SHOWING OF IRREPARABLE INJURY. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOME URGENCY WHAT'S THE URGENCY IT DOESN'T ALLOW THIS THING TO GO FORWARD IN NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION OR MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY ARE YOU COMING TO A NOW DID YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. AND JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY COMES TO YOU IN JUST MY GOD WE GET THESE ALL MY GUYS ALL THE TIME SO I JUST. IN PROTECTING LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT MAKES ENEMIES. I MEAN EVERYBODY GETS PISSED AT ME FOR ASKING THE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW AS THE DEAN OVER HERE US TO ALL DOGS IN TIS PLACE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THIS INSTITUTION. THE NUMBER WOULD CHECK THAT. COMMENT ABSOLUTELY. BACK TO A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE PLEASE THIS THIS BILL WAS ACTUALLY GOT IT IN A PROBES AND WE'RE TRYING TO PUT ME BACK INTO IT. WE'RE TRYING TO PUT THE SUBSTANCE BACK INTO IT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW IN NO UP TO ME AWAKENED ME IN THE MIDDLE HI THIS IS BEEN A LONGSTANDING PIECE OF WORK AND PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE CHAIRS AND MYSELF AS THE AUTHOR AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A TOPIC AND ACTUALLY A PRODUCT OF AB EIGHT SEVEN NINE WHICH WAS A BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. REPORT WHAT DO JUNE THIRTIETH AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT REPORT WAS HELD THE RESULTS OF THAT REPORT WERE HELD FOR A WHILE AND AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE THE REPORT WHAT WE DID WAS. MUCH COLLABORATION WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO PICK THE MOST BOB IT'S AND THE EASIEST TO IMPLEMENT AND PUT THAT IN INTO THIS BILL AND TO PUT SUBSTANCE INTO A BILL THAT WAS ALREADY MOVING FORWARD SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A NEW DISCUSSION SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ANYBODY. BUT SOMETHING THAT LEAVE EVERYONE IF THEY DIDN'T THEY SURE EXPECTED THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY AND JUST PRINT YOU SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOME OF THE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING. FORWARD TO MOVING SOMETHING FORWARD. THAT IS. HEAVY MEET AND- WILL SAVE THAT FOR FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOR NEXT YEAR THANK YOU MOVE THE BILL. COULD ANSWER.

NO LONGER YOU YOU MADE THE MOTION TO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR WHICH IS TO TURN THE BILL TO THE SENATE FLOOR SOME NUMBER IT IS WHEN I GO BACK TO THE- THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A INTENT TO BE A LOOK AT SOME DELAYED IMPLANTATION ORIGINALLY. I JUST WANNA GET YOUR TAKE AND I DON'T MEAN TO DO THIS ON THE FLY WITH UNITED PRE SHEET YOUR PATIENTS EITHER WE- DO A LETTER TOGETHER AND SEND IT OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS OR YOU DO A LOT OF THE JOURNAL. ABOUT ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT WAS YOUR INTENTION NOT TO HAVE THAT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION LANGUAGE IN THE BILL HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO PROCEED WITH THAT AND I DO BETTER DO ONE OR TWO.

I'M I'M JUST GUESSING THAT BOTTOM FOR SOME PEACE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CAME OUT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS PUSHED BACK. FROM FROM CITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE MEANT WE DON'T WANT DO NOT WE DO NOT WE AGREED TO THE ACTUAL X. THE EXPANDED APR PROVISIONS IN THE BILL AS AMENDED SO WE REQUESTED THREE AMENDMENTS. ONE WAS ABOUT THAT POPULATION THRESHOLD AFTER WHICH THE EXPANDED APR WOULD APPLY ONE WAS ABOUT THE REFERENCE TO THIS FEE PIECE WE'RE TALKING TO HOW YOU REPORT THAT IN THE APR. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO PUT THAT ON THE WEBSITE. IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT WOULD BE. JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY BASED ON A CONVERSATION ON. BEFORE. APPROPRIATIONS IN IN LATE AUGUST AND SO.
