00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:14.959
THE TIME SINCE WE'VE LEARNED OF

FROM GREATER CLARIFICATION.

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:19.129
AS MENTIONED BY THE SENATOR VERY

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.230

THE CONSENSUS IS THAT ANOTHER

00:43:34.578 --> 00:43:36.046
LAWSUIT WOULD BE NECESSARY WHICH

00:43:36.113 --> 00:43:37.715

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.390
BEFORE WITNESSING THE CHANGES TO

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:27.791
ZACHARY SEIZURES I WAS VERY

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.393
PREJUDICED AGAINST CANNABIS AND

00:50:29.459 --> 00:50:31.595
I WAS COMPLETELY AN EDUCATED

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:32.729
ABOUT ITS MEDICAL FACTS.

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:34.064
I UNDERSTAND THOSE OF YOU WHO

SPECIALIST HAD WORKED FOR

00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:43.006
ZACHARY.

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:43.707
AND THAT IS THE USERS HAVE

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.475
RESOLVED WITHOUT THE USE OF

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.377
CANNABIS OR PHARMACEUTICALS BUT

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.045
THAT IS NOT MY REALITY.

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:50.881
MY REALITY IS THAT WE EXHAUSTED

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.115
EVERY TREATMENT AND MEDICATIONS

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.617
WITH NO SUCCESS.

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.685
MY REALITY IS OUT OF DESPERATION

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.187
BEFORE TRYING CANNABIS I CHOSE A

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.889
DRUG THAT COULD CAUSE PARTIAL OR

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:00.490
TOTAL BLINDNESS AND 70% OF

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.092
PATIENTS.

00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:04.161
AND IT ACTUALLY MADE THESE

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:04.861
SEIZURES WORST.

00:51:04.928 --> 00:51:05.996
I REALITY IS THAT WITH THE

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.230
ASSISTANCE OF CANNABIS WE WENT

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.765
FROM BEING ON SEVEN MEDICATIONS

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:10.133
AND HAVING ABOUT SIXTY SEIZURES

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.369
A DAY. TO CURRENTLY ONLY BEING

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.937
ON ONE MEDICATION.

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:16.640
AND CANNABIS AND ITS LAST

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:17.240
GRANDMA SEIZURE WAS ALMOST TWO

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:17.874
YEARS AGO.

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.443
MY REALITY IS THAT MY SON THIS

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:21.011
YEAR LOSS NINETY HOURS OF

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:21.778
LEARNING IN HIS KINDERGARTEN

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:23.180
YEAR SO WE COULD PULL HIM OFF

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.916
CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICATIONS

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:27.250
TO KEEP A SEIZURES AT BAY.

00:51:27.317 --> 00:51:28.618
MY REALITY IS IT IS TEACHERS MAY

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:30.253
RETURN DESPITE THE PROGRESS THAT

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.188
WE HAVE MADE.

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:33.056
BUT ALL THIS NOISE SHOULD NOT BE

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.558
ZACHARY'S REALITY.

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:36.359

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:25.208
AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.377
REGARDING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:28.945
PEDIATRICIAN.

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:31.281
I DO THINK THAT -- THAT IS

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:32.916
IMPORTANT.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.251
AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH.

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.686
HOW MANY CHILDREN?

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:39.856

DEFINITELY DO NEED THEM.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.901
I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.335
CHILDREN HAVE TO BE TAKEN OUT TO

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:54.738
RECEIVE MEDICATION THAT'S NEEDED

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.473
FOR THEM THAT IS PRESCRIBED.

PROPERLY PRESCRIBED BY THEIR

00:52:58.108 --> 00:53:00.043
PEDIATRICIAN I THINK IS.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.979
IS IS IS WRONG -- AND BECAUSE OF

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:05.348
THAT I WOULD MOVE TO SPEND.

00:53:05.415 --> 00:53:05.949

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:20.864
RATES IT DOESN'T SATISFY MY

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.999
CONCERNS -- WE HEARD THIS BILL

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.335

YOU'VE TAKEN.

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.563
I STILL AM VERY CONCERNED THAT

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.466
WE DON'T HAVE TRUE PROTOCOLS.

00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.203
ON HOW.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.105
PARENTS SHOULD BE WORKING WITH

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:04.874
PEDIATRICIANS -- DIRECTLY.

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:07.277
WHEN THEIR -- THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:09.512
CREATE SOME SORT OF TREATMENT

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:12.616
FOR THEIR CHILD -- OF MEDICINAL

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:15.018
MARIJUANA DOCTOR WHO OFFERS A

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.653
PRESCRIPTION ONCE A YEAR.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.355
AS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:19.589
IS NOW.

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:20.890

ESPECIALLY WITH.

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:23.994
EXTREME HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.996
ALSO WHAT COULD BE MINOR HEALTH

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:27.364
CONDITIONS RIGHT IT DOESN'T KEEP

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:28.565
A PARENT FROM SAME MIGHT MY

00:54:28.632 --> 00:54:29.766
CHILD HAS.

A MIGRAINES AND I'M PLAYING WITH

00:54:32.135 --> 00:54:36.272

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:37.507
IS WHAT I'VE DECIDED FOR MY

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:40.477
CHILD IF IF I OFTEN ON THE

00:54:40.543 --> 00:54:42.145

AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT YOU

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.162
KNOW THERE WAS A TIME WHEN

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.563
PARENTS THOUGHT A LITTLE WHISKEY

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:01.865
IN A BOTTLE WOULD HELP A CHILD

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.099
SLEEP OR WOULD HELP WITH TV

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.067
RIGHT.

BOB I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.778
COMMITTEE THAT A BANK LEVY IS

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.713

OWED BY THE DEBTOR TO A CREDITOR.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.922
AS A POST JUDGMENT TOOL THE

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:02.325
SCENARIO THAT.

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.092
KEEPS BEING.

PEOPLE WAKING UP AND FINDING

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.097
THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS EMPTIED JUST

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.032
MAKES NO SENSE IN EFFECT THE

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.467
POST JUDGMENT TOOL MEANS THAT

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:13.369
THE DEBT HAS BEEN IN COLLECTION

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.037
FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:16.706
THE CREDITOR THEN MADE THE

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.107
DECISION TO GO TO COURT.

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:19.675
THEY MADE A DECISION TO GO TO

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.444
COURT TO GET A JUDGMENT AND SUE

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:22.812
THE DEBTOR BEGINS THE DAY IT WAS

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.080
NOT IN DISPUTE.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.582
AND BECAUSE THAT WE BELIEVE

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.150
THERE IS AN ABILITY TO PAY.

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:29.885
OR ELSE WHY WOULD THEY INCUR THE

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:31.821
COST OF AN ATTORNEY GOING TO

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:35.191
COURT AND COURT FEES. TO SUE THE

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:36.959
DEBTOR SO THEY WENT TO COURT THE

DEBTOR GOT NOTICE THAT THE ITEM

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:39.762
WAS IN COURT.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.464
A JUDGMENT WAS ISSUED IT WENT

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.032
BACK TO COLLECTION IT'S IN

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.567
COLLECTION AGAIN FOR ANOTHER

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.936
YEAR AT THAT POINT THE CREDITOR

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:49.338
GOES BACK TO COURT A SECOND TIME

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:52.341
TO GET A RICH. TO EXECUTE.

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.009
ALL ON THE BANK ACCOUNT.

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.478
THE PROBLEM WITH ONE OF THE

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.747
PROBLEMS WITH HIS BILL IS THAT

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.215
WELL YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT LOW

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:01.183
INCOME DEBTORS WAKING UP WITH NO

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.385
MONEY IN THEIR ACCOUNT.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.788
IN PRACTICALITY THIS BILL HAS NO

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.289
CONNECTION TO LOW INCOME.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.325
OUT ALL IT APPLIES ALL DEBTORS

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:11.594
WITH THEIR HIGH INCOME MIDDLE

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.128
INCOME.

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.096
ARM OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:18.000
WORKED ON IN THIS AREA WE HAVE

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:18.968
BEEN WILLING TO LIMIT.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:21.237
COLLECTION ACTIVITIES WHEN IT

01:07:21.303 --> 01:07:23.305
SPECIFICALLY TARGETS LOW ACTUAL

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:24.974
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS THE

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.575
EXAMPLES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.611
GIVEN WE CAN GIVE DOZENS AND

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.745
DOZENS OF EXAMPLES OF HIGH

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:31.814
INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BE

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.149
PROTECTED BY THIS BILL.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.750
ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS IS

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.619
BILL IS THAT WE HAVE AN EXISTING

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:38.154
PROCESS IN LAW.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.355
SO THE EXISTING PROCESS IS

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:40.623
CALLED THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.024
PROCESS WHICH WAS SET UP TO

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.726
PROTECT LOW INCOME PEOPLE TRULY

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.027
LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:47.329
THE BENEFIT OF THAT PROCESS IS

01:07:47.396 --> 01:07:49.165
THAT HAS JUDICIAL REVIEW TO

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.366
ENSURE THATYOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:51.801
PROTECTING LOW INCOME PEOPLE

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.135
UNDER THAT PROCESS SOCIAL

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:55.838
SECURITY SS I SS BE UNEMPLOYMENT

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.273
WELFARE ALL.

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:59.308
AUTOMATICALLY EXEMPTED THIS IS

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.677
THE NEW AUTOMATIC TWO THOUSAND

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.680
DOLLAR EXEMPTION ON TOP OF ALL

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:05.748
THOSE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.416
WILL TRULY LOW INCOME PEOPLE

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.984
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE A

01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:10.119
CLAIM.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:12.087
OF EXEMPTION FOR NECESSARIES OF

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:15.124
LIFE WHICH COVER RENT UTILITIES

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.692
FOOD.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.360
ALL OF THE THINGS THE

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:20.529
LEGISLATURE HAS DEFINED IN THIS

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.832
LEGISLATURE IS EXPANDED IN TERMS

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.200
OF THE EXEMPTION.

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:25.267
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.470
THE AUTOMATIC NATURE THE FACT

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:29.305
THAT IT PROTECTS ALL DEBTORS NO

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:30.806
MATTER THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS

01:08:30.873 --> 01:08:32.475
IT'S OVER BALK BROAD AND IT'S

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.778
UNCLEAR WE TALK ABOUT.

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.246
IT APPLIES TO A DAD OR NOT TWO

01:08:37.313 --> 01:08:39.014
ACCOUNTS THERE'S NO WAY THE

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.483
CREDITOR KNOWS WHAT ACCOUNTS THE

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.518
DEBTOR HAS THE BANKS GOT OFF THE

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.853
BILL BECAUSE THEY GOT OFF THE

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.054
HOOK OF HAVING TO MAKE THAT

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.555
DECISION BY THE AMENDMENTS.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.857
BUT IN ESSENCE THE UNDERLYING

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:49.792
PROBLEM WAS MADE WORSE BY ADDING

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.961
ANOTHER WHO PREFER IN ESSENCE

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:53.295
THE CREDITOR TO JUMP THROUGH.

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:56.465
SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE ARE

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:58.667
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU.

01:08:58.734 --> 01:08:59.835
THANKS WITH US PLEASE.

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:00.936
GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE

01:09:01.003 --> 01:09:02.137

GIPSON HERE ON BEHALF OF ON

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.740
COURT CAPITAL GROUP IN

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.042
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- I JUST

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:07.643
WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.478
WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THE

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.114
STORIES DESCRIBED IN TESTIMONY

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:13.582
AS WELL AS TO LOW INCOME DEBTORS.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.751
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL CAST A

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.419
WIDER NET THAN JUST LOW INCOME

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.755
DEBTORS IT IS AN AUTOMATIC TWO

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:21.423
THOUSAND DOLLAR EXEMPTION.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.225
FROM A LAST RESORT COLLECTIONS

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.161
PROCESS FOR ALL DEBTORS AND THE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:28.697
AUTOMATIC NATURE IS THE EXACT

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:31.467
REASON WE ARE CONCERNED -- DEBT

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:33.969
BANK LEVEES ARE A LAST RESORT IN

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:36.305
IN OUR ONE IN FIVE CONSUMERS

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.640
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE AN

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:40.175
ACCOUNT WITH US AND WHAT WE FIND

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.610
IS THAT BANK LEVEES.

01:09:41.677 --> 01:09:43.579
ARE THE LAST RESORT AFTER

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:44.880
SEVENTEEN NOTICES SEVENTEEN

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:45.781
ATTEMPTS TO WORK WITH THE

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.716
CONSUMER IT HAPPENS TO A TWO

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.685
THREE YEAR CYCLE AND OF TWO TO

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:50.920
THREE YEAR PROCESS.

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.121
THE OTHER MISSTATEMENT AYE I

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.689
BELIEVE IS THAT -- THE BANK

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.891
ACCOUNT IS ENTIRELY EMPTIED THIS

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.459
IS JUST NOT TRUE IT'S NOT TRUE

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:58.727
BECAUSE THERE'S BOTH FEDERAL AS

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.196
WELL STATE LAWS THAT PREVENT THE

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:02.364
BANK ACCOUNT FROM BEING LET

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.666
EMPTIED ENTIRELY.

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:04.767
LET'S START WITH THE FACT THAT

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:07.102
WHEN YOU GO TO ISSUE A BANK LEVY

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:09.572
ICE I SUBMITTED TO THE BANK.

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:11.340
THE BANK THAT'S OR THE CREDIT

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:12.908
UNION FOR THE CONSUMER IS

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.443
REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL TREASURY

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:17.012
LAWS TO LOOK BACK TO TWO MONTHS

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.981
OF ACTIVITY IN THE CONSUMERS

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.316
BANK ACCOUNT.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.751
AND AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCT THE

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:25.287
EXEMPTIONS THAT INCLUDE 75% OF

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:27.122
WAGES THAT I'VE MET THAT MAY

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.723
HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE BANK

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.291
ACCOUNT.

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.993
THINGS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.394
SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.762
FEDERAL EMPLOYEE AND CIVIL

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:35.664
SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS AS

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:37.666
WELL AS VETERANS BENEFITS SO

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.634
THAT'S STEP ONE THAT'S AN

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.569
AUTOMATIC PROCESS DONE BY THE

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:41.604
BANK ACCOUNT.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.939
THEN FROM THERE ON THEY RESPOND

01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.374
TO THE AMOUNT OF THE BANK LEVY

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:46.942
AND IF THE CONSUMER AT THAT

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.243
POINT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING MAY

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.045
HAVE BEEN MISSED OR THAT THEY DO

01:10:50.112 --> 01:10:51.714
NEED ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.315
FOOD RENT.

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.117
CAR PAYMENTS AT CETERA THAT IS

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.518
WHERE THEY CAN FILE THE CLAIM OF

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.786
EXEMPTION FORM.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.989
AS A CREDITOR WE HAVE TEN DAYS

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.657
TO RESPOND TO THAT FORM.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:03.659
IF THERE'S SOMETHING UNUSUAL ON

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.127
THE FORM THAT IS WHEN WE WOULD

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:06.528
OBJECT OTHERWISE THERE'S NO

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.097
REASON TO PROLONG THE PROCESS

01:11:08.163 --> 01:11:09.632
WITH A LOW INCOME DEBTOR AND

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.233
OBJECT. TO A CLAIM OF EXEMPTION

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.535
PROCESS SO THAT THE CLAIM IS

01:11:13.602 --> 01:11:15.537
PROCESSED WITHIN TEN DAYS IT IS

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:18.040
ONLY WHEN SOMETHING LIKE A BMW

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.375
AND MERCEDES BENZ IS BEING

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:20.676
CLAIMED AS AN EXEMPTION.

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:22.344
THAT WE WOULD THEN OBJECT AND IT

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:23.712
GOES FOR THE COURT TO DECIDE IN

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.514
THIRTY DAYS.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:26.048
SO AGAIN I JUST WANT TO

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.716
HIGHLIGHT THAT WHAT THIS IS

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.184
DOING IS TAKING AWAY THIS

01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:30.586
PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A REVIEW

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.287
DONE TO SAY DOES SOMEONE NEED

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:34.556
THE HELP OR ARE THEY GOING TO

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.057
JUST BE.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:39.161
GIVEN A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR OUT

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:41.797
FROM DEBT -- FINALLY I I I THINK

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:42.931
THAT DOES IMPLY THAT SIXTEEN

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.833
OTHER STATES HAVE THIS EXACT

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.935
THING UNDER CURRENT LAW IS JUST

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:47.936
NOT TRUE.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.438
THE VAST MAJORITY THERE'S ONLY A

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:51.006
COUPLE THAT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.641
NATURE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.643
STATES HAVE A PROCESS WHAT

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:56.879
CONSUMER MUST APPLY FOR THE

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:57.346
CLAIM.

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.381
JUST AS IT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:01.917
UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.886
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.087
OVERALL AS A PICTURE.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.555
IS GOING TO CAUSE LESS ACCESS TO

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:07.890
CREDIT FOR CONSUMERS HIGHER

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.658
INTEREST RATES I DON'T THINK

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:10.759
THAT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.094
DONE ANYTHING FOR THE BANKING

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.395
INDUSTRY.

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:14.563
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BANKS

01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.598
WILL TRULY BUFFER THEIR LOSSES

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.467
ON A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:19.868
FOR OTHER CONSUMERS BY

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.437
INCREASING INTEREST RATES.

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:23.205
AND AND GRANTING LESS CREDIT TO

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:26.341
LOW INCOME BORROWERS SO WE HAVE

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.010
TO LOOK AT THE LONG TERM.

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:28.410
ALBUMS THAT WILL.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.845
ACTUALLY GO TO THE LOW INCOME

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:31.680

THE THE BANKS EITHER ARE DOING A

01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:54.463
POOR JOB.

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:57.099

WHAT WE'RE GOING WITH AN

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:19.321

TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S NOT

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.560
THAT MUCH I MEAN IT WILL APPLY

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.861
TO ALL THAT IS NOT JUST LOW

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.462

HAVEN'T CHANGED WE HAVE A LOOK

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:36.605
AT THIS.

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:38.740
OF LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS SINCE WE

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.509
CREATE A BANK LEVEES SINCE WE'VE

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:42.277
BEEN IN SAID WHAT'S THE EFFECT

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.613
ON ON HUMAN LIVES AND I'VE.

THIS AREA AND I'M HERE TO

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:49.852
TESTIFY INTO.

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:54.923
EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS NOT THAT --

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.658
BIG OF AFFECT ON THE INDUSTRY AS

01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:57.993
IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE

01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.329
INDIVIDUAL -- CONSUMERS WHO WHO

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.064
ARE DEVASTATED BY HAVING NO

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.333
MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:06.368
YEAH BUT I DON'T I MEAN WHAT

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:08.770
THEY SAID THAT THAT THE PRICE

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:11.974
ALL BETTER SISTER YOU KNOW AND

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.643
CIARA.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.811
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:17.212
YOU SENATOR -- YOU KNOW THAT I

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.647
THINK THAT.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:21.016
WE WE KNOW THE NUMBERS SHOW --

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.317
EARLY STUDIES SHOW THAT ABOUT.

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.752
40% OF AMERICANS SHUT WITH EVEN

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:25.220
A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR EMERGENCY

01:15:25.287 --> 01:15:28.757
AND I THINK THAT IN CALIFORNIA --

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.325
GIVEN THE COST LIVING THE TWO

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:33.161
THOUSAND DOLLARS ISN'T A WHOLE

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.030
LOT IF THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE --

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.165
IT'S NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:42.337
THE OF THE DEBT COLLECTOR -- TO

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.406
ENSURE THAT OUR OF OUR LOW

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.607
INCOME AND AND DOES IT ARE

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.042
STRUGGLING TO GET BY.

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:49.378
CAN CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO GET

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.779
BY WITH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:51.780
THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S OUR

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.081
RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:53.649
THERE'S JUST.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.217
A BASE AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN LIVE

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:59.021
ON AND YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.756
MIDDLE INCOME MORE HIGHER INCOME.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.257
AND HAS MORE ON THEIR ACCOUNT

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:03.792
MORE THAN THEY CAN.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:04.593
TAKE IT ALL EXCEPT THE FOUNTAIN

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.028
OF THE LAST TWO THOUSAND I THINK

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.429
THAT'S ACTUALLY MUCH SIMPLER WAY

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:08.330
OF DOING IT.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:10.032
THEN ALL DID THIS OTHER PROCESS

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:12.067
OF DETERMINING WHAT MEANS THEY

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:15.270
HAVE BEEN -- AND I THINK THAT I

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:19.141
THINK THE TWO THOUSAND IS THE IT

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.776
IS THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO TO

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:22.311
ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.813
REALLY AT THE AT THE CUSP OF ON

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.048
THE EDGE I DON'T.

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.449
WE DON'T FALL OVER THAT CLIFF

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.384
AND SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:34.589
MOVE THE MOVE THIS.

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:35.190
THANK YOU THERE'S A MOTION IS

THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:53.041
I ALSO FEEL LIKE I'M NOT SURE --

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:55.444
I'VE EVER GOTTEN TO THE CORE OF

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.446
OF THE DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.982
PEOPLE SAY THIS BILL DOES --

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.450
IT'S NOT LIKE SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:02.951
PREDATORY LENDING BILLS THAT I

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:05.320
REALLY UNDERSTAND.

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:06.455
NUMBER ONE I THINK TWO THOUSAND

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.756
DOLLARS IS A LOT OF MONEY LIKE

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.624
MY CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE TWO

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:10.192
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.460
ACCOUNT SO WHEN IT'S PRESENTED

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:18.033

REPRESENT OF MAY BE.

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.111
SUBSTANTIALLY POOR COMMUNITY BUT

01:17:29.177 --> 01:17:30.746
VERY FEW PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE TWO

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:31.546
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK

01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:32.014
ACCOUNT.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.249
AND SO WHEN I HEAR THEN IT'S NOT

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.584
MEANS TESTED.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:38.220

WHEN PEOPLE HAVE REAL REAL

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.431
OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.566
PAY NOW I DO UNDERSTAND LIKE

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.168
THEY MIGHT HAVE IT FOR A MINUTE?

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.503
AND AND THAT'S COME THROUGH AND

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:56.071
MAYBE IT'S FOR OVER THREE MONTHS

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:58.840
AND YOU KNOW IT IT AT THAT.

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.442

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:34.943
SOME OF THE RHETORIC DOESN'T

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.312

TOP THE MOMENT THAT THE THE

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:06.141
BANKS GET IT SO YOU CAN IMAGINE

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.843

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES SO

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:30.565
WE'RE BELOW THAT NUMBER AS FAR

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:31.733

DESTITUTE.

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.752
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT I

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:26.054
ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:27.389
KIND OF BLANKET NO QUESTIONS

THAT THE RIGHT ON THE EDGE.

01:20:37.966 --> 01:20:39.000
THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT DO YOU HAVE

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:41.736
THE RESOURCES TO PAY A DEBT.

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:43.371
THAT IS LEGITIMATE.

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:44.739

THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS.

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:03.858
COULD END THE PRACTICE OF LIVING

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.760
BANK ACCOUNTS ESSENTIALLY FOR

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:07.996
THEM BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.998
A DEBTOR NEVER HAS MORE THAN TWO

01:21:10.065 --> 01:21:10.632
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR BANK

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:11.900

ANY MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.451
THE LEVY DOESN'T RECEIVE ANY

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:29.718
MONEY SO.

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:30.952

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:33.688
TRUE I MEAN IT'S JUST MEMBER

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.457
BANK LEVEES ARE ONE TOOL TO DEBT

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:37.425
COLLECTORS HAVE TO COLLECT ON

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:38.426

HERE TO CURB THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:52.073
THAT CAN BE TAKEN OUT OF

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:53.508
PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS BECAUSE IT

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:55.143
REFLECTS TODAY'S VALUE.

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:57.712
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.914
GOING TO BE -- NOT EXISTENT JUST

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:01.216

01:38:09.516 --> 01:38:13.454
COSTS THE LANDLORD HAVE -- TO

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:15.456
EXPERIENCE.

01:38:15.522 --> 01:38:16.557
WITH REGARD TO THE CONCERN THAT

01:38:16.624 --> 01:38:17.992
IT RESTRICTS THE LANDLORDS

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.860
ABILITY TO RAISE RENTS I WANT TO

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:22.329
CLARIFY VAL JEWS DO NOT LIMIT

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:24.632
THE AMOUNT THAT LANDLORDS CHOOSE

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:25.966
TO CHARGE FOR RENT.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.735
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.870
TO APPROVE AN INCREASE ONCE SAID

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:31.272
ABOUT YOUR EIGHTEEN IT IS IS IS

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:34.408
A TENANT -- IF IT'S NOT APPROVED

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:35.809
IN THE TEN IT WOULD HAVE TO MOVE.

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:36.777
THE LANDLORD WOULDN'T BE

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:38.178
PROHIBITED FROM INCREASING THE

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.713
RANT THEY JUST MIGHT LOSE THAT

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.148
SECTION EIGHT TENANT IF THE

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.316
HOUSING AUTHORITY.

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.051
BOB DOES NOT APPROVE THE

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:49.089
INCREASE.

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.791
THERE BEEN EXPRESSED CONCERNS

01:38:50.858 --> 01:38:53.060
WITH REGARD TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:57.498
INCREASED -- LAWSUITS.

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:59.400
AND THE REALITY IS FEE HOP

01:38:59.466 --> 01:39:01.035
PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:02.670
VARIOUS CLASSES OF PEOPLE BUT

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:03.671
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT A

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:04.705
LANDLORD WHO RECEIVED AN

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.674
APPLICATION FROM A QUALIFIED

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.175
TENANT WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF A

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.710
PROTECTED CLASS MUST ACCEPT THAT

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:10.377
PERSON.

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:11.879
IT JUST MEANS THAT THEY CAN'T

01:39:11.945 --> 01:39:13.314
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THEM.

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.848
THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THIS BILL

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:16.617
AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE IT

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:17.918
REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO TREAT

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:20.454
FAMILIES WITH ASSISTANCE FAIRLY

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:23.490
AGAIN IT DOES NOT REQUIRE.

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.492
THAT LANDLORDS EXCEPT THE

ANALYSES ARE QUITE CLEAR THAT

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:37.604
THE BILL IS NOT A MANDATE.

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:39.139

FOCUS ON WHAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:44.338
ON THEIR EDUCATION -- WHEN I

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.507
FIRST GOT MY VOUCHER I ONLY HAD

01:40:46.573 --> 01:40:47.608
TWO MONTHS TO LOOK FOR AN

01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:49.543

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:53.914
I ENDED UP LOOKING AT ABOUT

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:54.948
THIRTY TO FORTY APARTMENTS.

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:57.017
AFTER I GOT MY VOUCHER I HAVE TO

01:40:57.084 --> 01:41:00.020
REQUEST AN EXTENSION SO THAT IT

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.021
WOULD EXPIRE.

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:02.856
I FOUND A PLACE BECAUSE NONE OF

01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:03.991

01:41:04.057 --> 01:41:06.226
I COULD AFFORD.

01:41:06.293 --> 01:41:07.995
WOULD LET ME APPLY WITH MY

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.396
VOUCHER.

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:11.131
KNOWING THAT THE VOUCHER WAS

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:12.599
GETTING READY TO EXPIRE I WAS

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:21.141
I FINALLY DID FIND AN APARTMENT

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:22.910
THAT WOULD ACCEPT MY VOUCHER ON

01:41:22.976 --> 01:41:25.712
THE LAST DAY BEFORE IT EXPIRED.

01:41:25.779 --> 01:41:28.348
EVEN AFTER GIVEN THE EXTENSION I

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:31.285
CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO EXPRESS HOW

01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:33.020

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.788

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:46.633
I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT I REALIZE

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.836
THAT.

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:51.371
I NEEDED TO MOVE. TO A DIFFERENT

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:31.170
IS EQUAL TO OTHER APPLICANTS MY

01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:33.306
INCOME INCLUDING THE VOUCHER IS

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:35.208
EQUAL TO OTHER APPLICANTS THAT

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:36.709
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO CONSIDER MY

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:38.878
APPLICATION AS YOU DO OTHER

01:58:38.945 --> 01:58:41.814
APPLICANTS WITH WITH WITH EQUAL.

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.950
OF RELEVANT BACKGROUND SOLID

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:46.786
BACKGROUND CREDIT HISTORY INCOME

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.554
ALL IT SAYS IS THAT YOU MUST

01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:51.357
CONSIDER MY APPLICATION AS WELL

01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:54.026
THAT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY -- DENY MY

01:58:54.093 --> 01:58:56.562
APPLICATION BASED SOLELY ON THE

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:57.830
SOURCE OF MY INCOME.

01:58:57.897 --> 01:59:00.566
SO WHAT IF ALL THINGS WERE EQUAL

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:01.601
LET'S SAY ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.069
BUT USUALLY HAS YOUR TENANT YOU

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:05.805
HAD. ONE ONE APPLICANT WHO IS

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:08.207
SECTION A AND ONE WHO IS NOT.

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:10.176
YOU CHOOSE YOUR TENANT.

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:11.310
AND THEN I CAN CHU I COULD

01:59:11.377 --> 01:59:12.411
CHOOSE THAT TENET DOES NOT A

01:59:12.478 --> 01:59:13.446
SECTION EIGHT BECAUSE MAYBE I

01:59:13.513 --> 01:59:14.113
JUST.

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.548
I THINK A LOT OF LANDLORDS

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:16.883
ACTUALLY CHOOSE SECTION A

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:18.851
BECAUSE IT'S GUARANTEED INCOME

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:20.253
LIKE IT'S GET GOING TO GET PAID

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:20.920
FOR IT RIGHT SO I THINK I'LL AND

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.588
I THINK THE CONTENTION THAT

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:23.789
SOMEBODY WOULD NEVER WANT TO

01:59:23.856 --> 01:59:26.893
SECTION EIGHT IS NOT REALLY TRUE.

01:59:26.959 --> 01:59:30.263
BUT BUT IF I CHOSE SOMEONE IS

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:31.464
NOT SECTION.

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:32.798
EIGHT IN MY OPENING THE DOOR TO

01:59:32.865 --> 01:59:37.303
LIABILITY OR AT LEAST SOMEONE

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:38.237
BRINGING A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME.

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:38.838
BECAUSE AS YOU SAID YOU DON'T

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:39.639
WANT.

01:59:39.705 --> 01:59:40.439
TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE INTENT

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:42.441
AS YOU WANT LANDLORDS TO BE ABLE

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:43.976
TO CHOOSE WHETHER NOT THEY WANT

01:59:44.043 --> 01:59:44.944
TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:48.514
OR NOT MY INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE

01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:53.886
THAT -- SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:55.821
HOLDERS LIKE OUR WITNESS.

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:59.692
HAS A FAIR SHOT AT FINDING A

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:01.561
HOUSING SUITABLE FOR HER.

02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:04.196
MY INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I

02:00:04.263 --> 02:00:06.198
AM NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.500
SOLELY BASED ON THE SOURCE OF MY

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:10.736
INCOME -- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:14.707
SCAN -- ADS -- THAT THAT I THINK

02:00:14.774 --> 02:00:16.576
WOULD CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTION

02:00:16.642 --> 02:00:19.011
THAT PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT SECTION

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:21.247
EIGHT IT IS A COMMON THING TO

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:24.050
SEE AN AD. TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:25.751
NO SECTION EIGHT YOU SEE IT ON

ON APARTMENTS AND HOMES FOR RENT --

02:00:31.324 --> 02:00:32.558
AND SO I I CHALLENGE AT THAT

02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:33.492
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE

02:00:33.559 --> 02:00:35.595
BLANKET POLICY THAT THEY DO NOT

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.096
ACCEPT SECTION.

02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:39.098
EIGHT AGAIN WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:41.200
IF YOU HAVE -- MULTIPLE

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:43.569
APPLICANTS AND LORD KNOWS TODAY

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:45.905
THIS IS NOT A RENTER'S MARKET

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:47.373
THERE MORE WINTERS LOOKING FOR

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.641
UNITS IN THERE ARE AVAILABLE

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:51.010
UNITS SO YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:52.478
MULTIPLE APPLICANTS.

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:54.447
ALL WE'RE ASKING IS THAT I'M NOT

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:55.948
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BASED ON

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:58.517
MY SOURCE OF INCOME THAT YOU.

02:00:58.584 --> 02:01:00.786
INCLUDE ME IN YOUR DECISION

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.488
MAKING PROCESS.

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:03.923
YOUR ANALYSIS.

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:05.591
CLEARLY STATES THAT IT IS NOT A

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:07.927
MANDATE YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO

02:01:07.994 --> 02:01:09.362
TAKE ME AS YOUR TENANT WE'RE

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.530
SIMPLY ASKING THAT YOU INCLUDE

02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:14.100
ME IN YOUR OPTIONS OF PEOPLE

02:01:14.166 --> 02:01:16.068
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE YOUR SELECTION

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:16.268
FROM.

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.803
READ BUT IF.

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:19.972
IF LIKE WE SAID IN A HYPO IF

02:01:20.039 --> 02:01:21.874
EVERYTHING ELSE IS EQUAL.

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:22.608
AND YOU'RE RIGHT OTHERWISE AND

02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:25.144
I'D AND I DON'T USE THE SECTION

02:01:25.211 --> 02:01:25.311
8%.

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.847
AM I NOT DISCRIMINATING AS A

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:29.448
SECTION EIGHT PERSON BECAUSE I

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.817
AM LOOK AT THE ONLY REASON I'M

02:01:31.884 --> 02:01:32.718
NOT CHOOSING THAT PERSON.

02:01:32.785 --> 02:01:34.286
IS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:36.155
PARTICIPATE IN SECTION.

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:37.790
EIGHT RIGHT ON RIGHT I'M NOT

02:01:37.857 --> 02:01:39.025
SURE THAT YOUR ONLY REASONABLE

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.926
IF WE HADN'T RAM IF YOU READ

02:01:40.993 --> 02:01:42.628
THEM IS IT A HYPOTHETICALLY OKAY.

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:43.696
ALL RIGHT I THINK IT MIGHT BE

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:44.930
HELPFUL TO POINT OUT THAT WE

02:01:44.997 --> 02:01:46.632
HAVE EXISTING SOURCE OF INCOME

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:48.467
PROTECTIONS RIGHT NOW -- THAT

02:01:48.534 --> 02:01:51.137
APPLY TO ALL OTHER FORMS OF OF

02:01:51.203 --> 02:01:53.239
INCOME WE JUST HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:54.674
CARVE OUT FOR HOUSING ASSISTANCE

02:01:54.740 --> 02:01:56.042
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GET AN

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:57.410
APPLICANT.

02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:58.544
WHO INTENDS TO PAY WITH WAGES

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:00.346
FROM A JOB AND ANOTHER APPLICANT

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:01.514
WHO INTENDS TO PAY WITH SOCIAL

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:02.415
SECURITY?

02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:05.518
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THAT

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.185
AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR DECISION.

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:07.119
BUT YOU ARE STILL FREE TO CHOOSE

02:02:07.186 --> 02:02:08.854
AMONG QUALIFIED APPLICANTS AND

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.256
DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF

02:02:10.322 --> 02:02:11.724
LIABILITY CREATED BY YOU KNOW

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:13.392
THOSE PROTECTIONS -- AND THEN I

02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:15.094
THINK THE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:17.096
ON THE LIABILITY QUESTION IS

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.264
THERE IS THIS ADMINISTRATIVE

02:02:18.330 --> 02:02:20.232
COMPLAINT PROCESS -- AND SO EVEN

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:21.701
IF SOMEBODY IS MAKING THE CLAIM

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.169
THAT THAT WAS THE REASON FOR

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:25.071
YOUR DECISION -- IT TYPICALLY

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:26.772
GETS RESOLVED THROUGH.

02:02:26.839 --> 02:02:28.908
MEDIATION AND AND SORT OF AN

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:30.409
INVESTIGATION PROCESS AT THE

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:34.046
IDEA OF THE H. IT RARELY GOES TO

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:35.581
LITIGATION.

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:37.283
RIGHT -- MULLIN ALL THAT I MEAN

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:37.883
OPPOSITION IF YOU WANTED TO

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:38.517
RESPOND ANY OF THOSE POOR THINK

02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:40.286
THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD

02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:42.655
IS THAT -- IF THE ONLY APPLICANT

02:02:42.722 --> 02:02:43.756
AS I STATED EARLIER WERE THE

02:02:43.823 --> 02:02:44.757
SECTION EIGHT APPLICATION YET

02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:46.826
THE OWNER HAD NOT SIGNED A

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.594
CONTRACT WITH YOUR LOCAL HOUSING

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:49.695
AUTHORITY.

02:02:49.762 --> 02:02:51.030
THERE PROBABLY WOULD BE A

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:52.331
MANDATE THAT YOU GO DOWN TO SIGN

02:02:52.398 --> 02:02:53.899
THE CONTRACT I THINK THAT'S

02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:55.534
WHERE WE'RE KIND OF DIFFERING.

02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:56.435
YES IF THERE'S AN THE ONLY

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:57.903
APPLICANT AND THE ONLY AFRICAN

02:02:57.970 --> 02:02:59.405
IS SECTION EIGHT AND YET I

02:02:59.472 --> 02:03:00.206
HAVEN'T SIGNED A GOVERNMENT

02:03:00.272 --> 02:03:02.475
CONTRACT DO I HAVE TO SIGN A

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:03.342
GOVERNMENT CONTRACT.

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:05.044
IF YOU SAY NO.

02:03:05.111 --> 02:03:08.214
WE'RE GOOD TO GO I'M A LANDLORD.

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.815
AND WHEN I POST.

A UNIT THAT'S OPEN THERE'S NO

02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:13.252
CUT OFF TIME AND SO I HAVE

02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:14.787
APPLICANTS THAT COME IN IN THE

I MAY HAVE TEN THAT ARRIVE

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:20.025
TUESDAY WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY SO

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.527
THERE'S NO CUT OFF TIME SO WHEN

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:22.762
YOU SAY YOU RECEIVED ONE

02:03:22.828 --> 02:03:23.996
APPLICATION.

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:26.465
I CAN'T IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN

02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:28.567
THIS MARKET WHERE FOR RENTAL

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:29.802
UNIT.

02:03:29.869 --> 02:03:31.070
THAT YOU GO TO RECEIVE ONE

02:03:31.137 --> 02:03:33.672
APPLICANT PERIOD SO WE'RE NOT

02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:34.807
SAYING.

02:03:34.874 --> 02:03:37.743
THERE'S NO CUT OFF TIME IF I UP

02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:39.445
LIST ON CRAIG'S LIST OR

APARTMENTS DOT COM.

02:03:41.514 --> 02:03:42.381
MY UNIT.

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.650
APPLICATIONS ROLAND CONSISTENTLY

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:46.452
AND THEN I AS A LANDLORD MAKE MY

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:48.053
DECISION ABOUT WHEN I WANT TO

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:49.288
MAKE MY DECISION.

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:50.356
AND SO YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT

02:03:50.422 --> 02:03:53.392
THE ONE APPLICATION EXAMPLE I

02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:54.493
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THAT WORKS

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.895
IT IS NOT LIKELY THE FIRST.

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:58.330
IN THE DOOR THE FIRST QUALIFIED

02:03:58.397 --> 02:03:59.932
IS THE ONE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IF

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:01.834
YOU DON'T WANT TO FACE THE

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:02.935
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM.

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:05.070
SO THAT'S MY POINT IS THE FIRST

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:06.505
IN FIRST QUALIFIED IF YOU'RE

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:07.106
GONNA LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:08.841
WEEKS.

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:10.442
FINE BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:13.445
QUESTION BECOMES WHERE IS THE

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:14.547
LINE IT WHICH YOU FACE

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.115
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE I DIDN'T

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:18.417
ACCEPT THE FIRST INCOME THE

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:20.052
FIRST QUALIFY AND I'M GONNA STOP

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:20.820
THE BACK AND FORTH.

02:04:20.886 --> 02:04:23.756
GRANDSON QUESTIONS FROM FROM

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:24.390
MEMBERS RIGHT I THINK IT HAS A

02:04:24.456 --> 02:04:27.993
POINT AND THAT THAT THAT IS A

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:30.262
HYPOTHETICAL YOU CAN ANSWER THE

02:04:30.329 --> 02:04:30.863
THE SITE AND I THINK THE POINT

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:31.030
IS.

02:04:31.096 --> 02:04:31.864
IT SEEMS TO ME IS THIS THE IT IT

02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:35.167
IT IT POTENTIALLY OPENS THE DOOR

02:04:35.234 --> 02:04:36.602
FOR MORE LITIGATION.

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:38.137
FIRST IN FOR SOMEONE TO SAY WELL

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:39.672
HEY I THINK YOU DIDN'T.

02:04:39.738 --> 02:04:41.073
ADD THAT THINK YOU DIDN'T READ

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.074
TO ME BECAUSE OF THAT NOW THIS

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:42.741
REASON.

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:43.475
RIGHT.

02:04:43.542 --> 02:04:45.711
AND MAYBE YOU DIDN'T WRITE LIKE

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:46.912
YOUR YOUR LANDLORD MAYBE YOU

SORRY JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT

02:06:08.994 --> 02:06:10.596
QUESTION IS THAT HOW IS THAT

02:06:10.663 --> 02:06:12.665
ALSO YOUR INTERPRETATION.

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.600
THAT IS NOT YOUR INTERPRETATION.

02:06:14.667 --> 02:06:16.201
OKAY SIR.

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:16.835
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WRAPPING

02:06:16.902 --> 02:06:18.871
MY HEAD AROUND SOME OF THIS

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:20.172
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:21.840
FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT IN TERMS

02:06:21.907 --> 02:06:23.375
OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS CREATES A

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:24.410
MANDATE SO.

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:25.778
THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEES

02:06:25.844 --> 02:06:27.112
ANALYSIS SAYS THIS DOES NOT

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:29.081
CREATE A MANDATE DEPOSITIONS

02:06:29.148 --> 02:06:30.983
INTERPRETATION AND INDEED JERRY

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.117
BROWN'S INTERPRETATION OF A

02:06:32.184 --> 02:06:32.985
SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:35.254
LAST YEAR WAS THAT IT CREATED A

02:06:35.321 --> 02:06:35.521
MANDATE.

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.222
HI I'M TRYING REALLY HARD TO

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:38.958
RECONCILE THAT PERHAPS IF YOU

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:40.626
COULD TELL ME WHY YOU THINK IT

02:06:40.693 --> 02:06:41.794
DOES CREATE A MANDATE.

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.662
AND THEN THE AUTHOR CAN TELL US

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:46.799
WHY SHE PLEASE IT DOES NOT

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:49.768
CREATE A MANDATE.

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:50.536
AGAIN ON ON A HYPOTHETICAL.

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:51.337
NOT SAYING THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:53.739
ONLY HAVE ONE APPLICANT BUT IF

02:06:53.806 --> 02:06:55.240
WE DO HAVE ONE APPLICANT.

02:06:55.307 --> 02:06:56.241
AND I'M WILLING TO SAY EXCEPT

02:06:56.308 --> 02:06:57.576
SECTION NAY BUT I HAVE NOT

02:06:57.643 --> 02:06:59.111
SIGNED A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT NOR

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:00.312
DO I WANT TO SIGN A GOVERNMENT

02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:02.181
CONTRACT.

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:03.816
THERE WILL BE A LAWSUIT.

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:06.251
THAT'S WHAT OUR CONCERN IS SO WE

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:08.320
SAY THAT IS A MANDATE.

02:07:08.387 --> 02:07:10.990
DOES THAT HELP.

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:11.857
SO THERE'S ONLY AND I MANDATE

02:07:11.924 --> 02:07:13.926
EXISTS ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT

02:07:13.993 --> 02:07:15.995
THERE'S A SINGLE APPLICANT OR

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.863
AMENDED EXISTS IN OTHER AGAIN WE

02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:19.598
WOULD STAND FIRST QUALIFIED EVEN

02:07:19.665 --> 02:07:20.933
IF YOU'RE GOING TO WAIT AND HOLD

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.301
THE DOOR OPEN FOREVER.

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:23.068
IF YOU'RE GONNA WAIT AND HOLD

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:24.336
THE DOOR OPEN FOREVER I WOULD

02:07:24.403 --> 02:07:26.071
ARGUE AGAIN THERE'S LEGAL

02:07:26.138 --> 02:07:27.639
LIABILITY BECAUSE YOU WAITED.

02:07:27.706 --> 02:07:28.540
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT EXCEPT

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:29.975
THAT FIRST APPLICANT BECAUSE YOU

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:32.945
DIDN'T WANT TO GO SIGN THE

02:07:33.012 --> 02:07:34.680
GOVERNMENT CONTRACT.

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:35.914
I WOULD HAVE YOU MIGHT HAVE

02:07:35.981 --> 02:07:37.249
THREE COMING IN BEHIND IT BUT IF

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.084
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE IT OPEN UNTIL

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:39.618
THERE IS NO SECTION EIGHT

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:41.220
APPLICANTS.

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:44.156
THERE'S GONNA BE LEGAL LIABILITY.

02:07:44.223 --> 02:07:45.324
NUYS CA ARE AGREES WITH THE

02:07:45.391 --> 02:07:45.891
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER'S

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.893
ASSESSMENT NOW WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:50.596
OUR MEMBERS ON THIS ISSUE -- AN

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:52.131
INTERESTING FACT FOR THE

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:54.133
CONSIDERATION OF THE OF THE

02:07:54.199 --> 02:07:55.834
COMMITTEE -- IS THAT -- A LOT OF

02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:57.436
PEOPLE FORGET THIS YOU HAVE TO

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:58.804
HAVE A REAL ESTATE LICENSE TO

02:07:58.871 --> 02:07:59.705
PERFORM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:01.340
SERVICES OR OR MEMBERS DEAL WITH

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:02.975
THIS ON A DAILY BASIS -- AND

02:08:03.042 --> 02:08:04.043
WHAT THEY'VE TOLD US THE

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:04.877
FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED FROM

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:07.112
THEM IS THAT EVEN IF YOU GET

02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:08.647
MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS.

02:08:08.714 --> 02:08:09.715
YOU STILL HAVE TO PICK THAT

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:10.749
OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE SECTION EIGHT

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:11.817
APPLICANT OR RISK FACING

02:08:11.884 --> 02:08:13.685
LITIGATION AND SO THIS IS GOING

02:08:13.752 --> 02:08:15.621
TO CREATE A VERY MURKY WORLD --

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.322
IN THE LANDLORD TENANT SPACE --

02:08:17.389 --> 02:08:18.590
AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S WHY

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:21.160
GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO IT LAST

02:08:21.226 --> 02:08:22.227
YEAR [inaudible]

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:24.997
OKAY.

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.098
THEN MAY I RESPOND YEAH.

02:08:26.165 --> 02:08:27.933
FIRST OF ALL I SB FOURTEEN

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:28.901
TWENTY SEVEN IT WAS RAISED BY

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:30.369
THE OPPOSITION THE HOUSING

COMMITTEE AND AND I BROUGHT TO

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:33.672
THEIR ATTENTION AND THAT THAT

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:35.107
WAS NOT A BILL THEY SUPPORTED.

02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:37.242
EITHER SO I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.011
BEING REFERENCED -- TODAY -- IN

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:40.479

WITH THIS PAID SIX SB THREE TWO

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.450
NINE WOULD NOT FORCE IN THE

02:08:44.516 --> 02:08:46.685
LANDLORD THE CONTRACT WITH THE

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:49.054
HOUSING AUTHORITY.

02:08:49.121 --> 02:08:52.524
IT IS NOT A MANDATE -- I MEAN I

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:53.959
DON'T KNOW WE'VE HAD THE

02:08:54.026 --> 02:08:55.828

LANGUAGE OF WHO APPLYING THE

SAME IT IS NOT OUR INTENT.

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:13.412
TO CREATE A MANDATE IT IS NOT

02:09:13.479 --> 02:09:14.012
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ABOUT

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:17.149
SPRING TOLD HOLD ON HOLD ON

02:09:17.216 --> 02:09:17.749

THERE THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY

02:09:35.767 --> 02:09:38.437
PROHIBITED INSURANCE COMPANIES.

INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:59.858
ABLE TO OFFER HIGHER RATES ARE --

LANDLORDS I'VE NEVER BEEN ASKED

02:10:06.198 --> 02:10:08.333
BY MY INSURER YOU HAVE IF I HAVE

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.135
SECTION EIGHT TENANTS.

02:10:10.202 --> 02:10:11.336
THAT'S DELIVERED IN MY

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:11.837
EXPERIENCE AND IT'S MY

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:13.272
UNDERSTANDING.

02:10:13.338 --> 02:10:14.773
AND A BEFORE.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:15.274
FOR SEVEN THAT INSURANCE

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:16.675
COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY BARRED

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:18.076
FROM ASKING FOR INFORMATION

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.344

IS ACCEPTED BY A PROPERTY OWNER.

02:10:21.847 --> 02:10:23.348
SO I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE

02:10:23.415 --> 02:10:24.850
INFERENCE COMES THAT YOU HAVE

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:27.186
INCREASED INSURANCE UNLESS

02:10:27.252 --> 02:10:28.554

VACATED OR OR DAMAGE IN THE UNIT

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:34.793
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT.

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.161
WHY THEY FEEL YOUR INSURANCE

02:10:36.228 --> 02:10:38.530
RATES WOULD BE INCREASE BASED ON

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.799
A BEFORE?

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.034

WHY DO YOU AND YOUR MEMBERS?

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:47.506
THINK THAT YOU'RE GETTING CHARGE

02:10:47.573 --> 02:10:48.807
HIGHER INSURANCE RATES.

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:50.342
UP BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY ARE

THEY MAY NOT INSURANCE INSURANCE

02:10:58.083 --> 02:10:59.318
COMPANIES ABSOLUTELY IT DOESN'T

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:01.386

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:31.650
GOOD THING -- AND I'M THINKING

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:35.053
IN TERMS OF TENANTS WHO NEED

02:11:57.509 --> 02:12:01.480
THAT THE THE SECTION EIGHT IS A

02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.181
IS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS%

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:04.716
BASICALLY STANDING BEHIND

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:05.017
[inaudible]

02:12:05.083 --> 02:12:06.518
THE TENET.

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.120
AT ENSURING THAT THE LANDLORD

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:12.391
WILL BE PAY -- IF I'M A LANDLORD

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.558
AND I'VE GOT A TWENTY FIVE YEAR

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:15.427
OLD WHO.

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:16.461
SEEMS LIKE A GOOD PERSON GOOD

02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:21.199
CANDID -- HAS A GOOD INCOME AS A

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:22.734
MAYBE WORK LONG ENOUGH HASN'T

02:12:22.801 --> 02:12:24.303
ESTABLISHED ENOUGH CREDIT.

02:12:24.369 --> 02:12:26.004
MAYBE I DESIRE.

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:28.173

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.441
LIFE SITUATION MY DAD JUST.

02:12:29.508 --> 02:12:32.611
THIS LAST YEAR SO ONCE THE

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:34.613
PARENTS SIGNED ON HE WAS GOOD TO

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.447
GO.

02:12:35.514 --> 02:12:38.850
SO I'M I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED WHY.

02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:40.118
THIS IS BEING VIEWED A LITTLE

02:12:40.185 --> 02:12:42.387
BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN HOW YOU

02:12:42.454 --> 02:12:45.223
WOULD PROBABLY INTERPRET -- THAT

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:49.628
THAT SITUATION TO ALL THE OTHER

02:12:49.695 --> 02:12:52.397
DAY.

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:53.699
SHIPS THAT THIS WHOLE BILL IS

02:12:53.765 --> 02:12:54.633
TURNING.

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:55.801
NUMBER ONE IT'S NOT A MANDATE.

02:12:55.867 --> 02:12:57.636
THEN WE WOULD SUGGEST.

02:12:57.703 --> 02:13:00.472
AMEND THE BILL. TWO SO STATE THE

02:13:00.539 --> 02:13:03.008
SECOND PART IS NOT ANSWERING

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:05.444
THIS HOLDEN'S QUESTION.

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:06.345
I THINK THE QUESTION WE HAVE IS

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:07.579
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:09.348
GUARANTOR AS A PARENT.

02:13:09.414 --> 02:13:10.716
OF THE GOVERNMENT ISSUE WHERE'S

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.117
THERE'S EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES OF

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.518
REGULATIONS INVOLVED THERE'S

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:15.053
JUST BECAUSE EVICTION AND YOUR

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.455
YOUR REQUIREMENTS ARE MUCH

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:17.322
DIFFERENT.

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:18.323
YOUR PARENTS NOT GOING TO GET

02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:19.758
INVOLVED IN THE JUST CAUSE

02:13:19.825 --> 02:13:21.893
EVICTION REQUIREMENTS -- AND

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.128
RIGHT EIGHT HUNDRED PAGES OF THE

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:24.963
GUARANTOR RIGHT SO I THINK

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.531
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE --

02:13:26.598 --> 02:13:28.400
UNFORTUNATELY -- AND I THINK

02:13:28.467 --> 02:13:30.235
THAT'S WHAT ARE OUR PROBLEM IS

02:13:30.302 --> 02:13:31.536
YOUR PARENTS ON TO COME WELL

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:32.604
MAYBE THEY DO THOSE THOSE

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:34.072
HELICOPTER PARENTS MAY COME AND

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:35.774
INSPECT THE THE PROPERTY BUT YOU

02:13:35.841 --> 02:13:37.209
STILL DO HAVE THE INSPECTION

02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:38.577
REQUIREMENTS THE DELAY

02:13:38.643 --> 02:13:39.745
REQUIREMENTS SIX ADDRESS AND I

02:13:39.811 --> 02:13:39.978
THINK.

02:13:40.045 --> 02:13:41.813
AGAIN IT'S NOT THE APPLICANT

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.181
IT'S NOT THE HIGH SCHOOL OR THE

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:47.652
COLLEGE STUDENT IT'S THE PROCESS.

02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:49.521
MISTER CHAIR IF I MIGHT. TO

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:50.722

ONE THING THAT WE WOULD SAY WITH

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:57.696
RESPECT YOUR QUESTION IS THE

02:13:57.763 --> 02:13:59.131
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- SECTION

02:13:59.197 --> 02:14:00.365
EIGHT OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE

02:14:00.432 --> 02:14:01.199
ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:09.007
CASH EQUIVALENT VOUCHERS FROM

ATTENDANCE WE'RE ABLE TO CLOSE

02:14:11.777 --> 02:14:13.011
THAT LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW.

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.579
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH WHEN

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:15.914
WITH VOUCHERS AND SECTION.

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:16.948
EIGHT IS THAT SECTION EIGHT DOES

02:14:17.015 --> 02:14:18.116
COME WITH A CONTRACTUAL

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:18.917
OBLIGATION WITH THE HOUSING

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:20.485

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:22.320
REQUIREMENTS -- INSPECTION

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:23.955
REQUIREMENTS - THE HOUSING

02:14:24.022 --> 02:14:25.891

HAS TO BE PASSED THROUGH THE

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.495
HOUSING AUTHORITY.

02:14:30.562 --> 02:14:31.129
WHICH FOR SOME LANDLORDS AS YOU

INDICATE IT'S GUARANTEED INCOME

02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:35.000
SO FOR SOME LANDLORDS THEY LOOK

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:35.867
AT THAT IS A BENEFIT IN THE

02:14:35.934 --> 02:14:36.735

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:42.007
NOW.

02:14:42.073 --> 02:14:42.174
NO.

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.341
A HOUSING AUTHORITY -- TYPICALLY

IT WITH RESPECT TO RENT

02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:45.577
INCREASES IN THIS IS SOMETHING%

02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:46.111
THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE IS

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:47.779
PROBLEMATIC GOING FORWARD WITH

02:14:47.846 --> 02:14:49.714
RESPECT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

02:14:49.781 --> 02:14:51.116
WHICH ARE NEUTRAL ON BECAUSE WE

02:14:51.183 --> 02:14:52.551
SEE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:54.686
BALANCE BETWEEN. TEN PROTECTIONS

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:55.787
AND ALSO ALLOWING THE LANDLORD A

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:57.522
FAIR RATE OF RETURN IF THIS BILL

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:59.491
WERE ALSO TO GO THROUGH -- AND

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:01.326
THEN EFFECTIVELY FORCE IN OUR

02:15:01.393 --> 02:15:02.294
ESTIMATION EFFECTIVELYFORCE

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:03.628
PROPERTY OWNERS PARTICIPATE IN

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.130
SECTION EIGHT YOU COULD HAVE AN

02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:06.398
INSTANCE WHERE YOU HAVE A SMALL

02:15:06.465 --> 02:15:07.499
PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:09.067
YOU KNOW AN ELDERLY COUPLE DOWN

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.635
ANOTHER SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE.

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:11.603
AND THEY GET AN OTHERWISE

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:13.238
ELIGIBLE SUCH NEED APPLICANT

02:15:13.305 --> 02:15:14.005
THEY HAD TO TAKE THAT APPLICANT

02:15:14.072 --> 02:15:16.041
THEREFORE SEND THE CONTRACTUAL

02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:16.608
OBLIGATION WITH THE HOUSING

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:17.642
AUTHORITY.

02:15:17.709 --> 02:15:18.677
AND IT HERE TO ALL THOSE OWNERS

02:15:18.743 --> 02:15:20.078
REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING PASSING

02:15:20.145 --> 02:15:22.080
THROUGH ALL RENT INCREASES AND

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:23.348
SO WHILE AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:26.518
IS CURRENTLY SET AT 7% PLUS CPI.

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:31.456
HE COULD HAVE AN INSTANCE WHERE

02:15:31.523 --> 02:15:33.191
THE HOUSING AUTHORITY SAYS NO.

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:34.025
WE'RE JUST GOT WHICH HAVE CPI OR

02:15:34.092 --> 02:15:34.626
CPI PLUS ONE AND THAT COULD BE

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:35.260
EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC FOR SMALL

02:15:35.327 --> 02:15:35.927
PROPERTY OWNERS -- AND SO WE SEE

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:36.461
THAT IS SORT OF CREATING A

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:37.195
DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE

02:15:37.262 --> 02:15:38.697
MARKETPLACE -- WHICH IS WHY IN

02:15:38.763 --> 02:15:40.365
OUR ESTIMATION ASECTION IT

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:41.466
SHOULD REMAIN VOLUNTARY BECAUSE

WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY

02:15:42.801 --> 02:15:43.568
THAT'S WHETHER IS THAT

02:15:43.635 --> 02:15:45.704
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION.

WHAT DO?

02:15:51.576 --> 02:15:53.111
FIRST I I MEAN THIS BILL HAS

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:56.014
DOES NOTHING TO IMPACT WHETHER

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:56.648
NOT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM

02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:57.449
OR NOT.

02:15:57.516 --> 02:16:01.820
IT IS NOT A MANDATE.

02:16:01.887 --> 02:16:03.321
NOT ONE SPEAK TO THE ELEMENTS OF

02:16:03.388 --> 02:16:04.489
THE OTHER BILL THAT'S NOT MY

02:16:04.556 --> 02:16:05.924
BILL AT THE BILL THAT'S ON THE

02:16:05.991 --> 02:16:09.728
TABLE TODAY -- THE BILL IN CHIEF

INTO IT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

02:16:26.845 --> 02:16:28.547
WHEN THE BILL ALREADY IS NOT A

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.048
MANDATE SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY

02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:31.917
THAT'S WHY AS I'VE SAID BEFORE

02:16:31.983 --> 02:16:32.751
I'M NOT ACCEPTING THAT AMENDMENT

02:16:32.817 --> 02:16:33.418

02:16:42.427 --> 02:16:43.595
THE BILL IN CHIEF IS NOT A

02:16:43.662 --> 02:16:46.164

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.108
WHETHER IT SAYS IT'S A MANDATE

02:16:57.175 --> 02:17:01.980

02:17:09.087 --> 02:17:11.022
THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING SO THAT

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:13.592
IS A DECISION AS LEGAL ADVICE

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:15.594
THAT SHE WOULD GIVE TO LANDLORDS

02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:17.562
TO TREAT IT LIKE A MANDATE BUT

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:18.930
IT'S NOT A MANDATE.

02:17:18.997 --> 02:17:20.398
NOW HOUSING DISCRIMINATION LAWS

02:17:20.465 --> 02:17:23.368
SO -- YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.170

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:31.409
DISCRIMINATORY LAWS CRACKED.

02:17:31.476 --> 02:17:33.178
WELL AGAIN THE ARGUMENT COMES

02:17:33.244 --> 02:17:34.479
BACK DOWN TO LEGAL LIABILITY

02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:36.314
FIRST IN FIRST QUALIFIED IS THE

02:17:36.381 --> 02:17:39.017
LEGAL -- TO AVOID A LEGAL

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:40.452
[inaudible]

02:17:40.518 --> 02:17:46.691
BUT I MEAN I DON'T ITEM PRACTICE

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.627
AND THAT'S THE MODEL LANDLORD

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:50.729
WAS A TENANT FOR A LONG TIME --

02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:52.764
THERE.

02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:55.367
YOU CAN MAKE CHOICES BETWEEN

02:17:55.433 --> 02:17:58.603
MULTIPLE APPLICANTS.

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.005
CRACKED I MEAN IF YOU.

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:01.506
YOU DON'T LITERALLY I MEAN IT'S

02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:02.741
NOT LIKE WHICH ONE CAME OVER THE

02:18:02.807 --> 02:18:04.709

02:18:06.478 --> 02:18:07.512
YOU KNOW.

02:18:07.579 --> 02:18:09.080
I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S DECISIONS

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.982
THAT ARE MADE OF IF IT'S LIKE IN

02:18:11.049 --> 02:18:12.550
MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:14.552
WE GET FIVE OR SIX APPLICATIONS

02:18:14.619 --> 02:18:17.389
ALL ON THE SAME DAY RIGHT.

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:19.991
AND YOU MAKE A DECISION.

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:21.826
AND IT JUST CAN'T BE.

02:18:21.893 --> 02:18:23.895
BIASED BY CERTAIN FACTORS THAT

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:26.531
ARE YOU'RE PROHIBITED FROM USING

02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:27.899
AGAINST AN APPLICANT

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:28.199
[inaudible]

02:18:28.266 --> 02:18:30.368
OKAY.

02:18:30.435 --> 02:18:31.903
SO IF A LANDLORDS NOT

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:33.405
DISCRIMINATE DEAN ON THOSE

02:18:33.471 --> 02:18:36.141
FACTORS THEN -- THAN THEIR LEGAL

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:39.678
LIABILITY IS IS NONEXISTENT.

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:41.680
IS THAT CORRECT UNLESS I REFUSED

02:18:41.746 --> 02:18:42.914
TO SIGN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACT

02:18:42.981 --> 02:18:44.282
WHERE ARE WE THEN.

02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:45.083
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.018
STRUGGLING WITH I REFUSED TO

02:18:47.085 --> 02:18:48.687
SIGN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:50.055
THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:52.390
ABOUT THAT PART OF THE MANDATE

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:54.359
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAD ASKED.

02:18:54.426 --> 02:18:54.859
FOR OKAY AND THAT'S THE

02:18:54.926 --> 02:18:56.828
ADDITIONAL.

02:18:56.895 --> 02:18:58.663
IS THAT DIFFERENT OKAY.

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:00.131
I SEE THIS BILL THIS AND I AND

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:02.934
THIS IS WHY I UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:03.501
CONCERNS BUT I SEE THE BILLS

02:19:03.568 --> 02:19:04.969
THIS.

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:06.671
I THINK SECTION EIGHT IS CODE

02:19:06.738 --> 02:19:08.773
FOR SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT SO WHEN

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.208
I SEE A TIME TO BE REALLY HONEST

02:19:10.275 --> 02:19:12.644
WHEN I SEE A SIGN SAYS NO

02:19:12.711 --> 02:19:14.245
SECTION -- EIGHT YOU DON'T SEE

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:15.580
THAT MY NEIGHBORHOOD BECAUSE

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:17.148
EVERYBODY WHO'S RENTERS BLACK OR

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.650
BROWN RIGHT.

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:19.584
YOU SEE IT IN NEIGHBORHOODS

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.020
WHERE -- I'M SORRY I THINK IT'S

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:24.723
KIND OF LIKE.

02:19:24.789 --> 02:19:26.257
WHAT PEOPLE THE LANDLORDS

02:19:26.324 --> 02:19:29.294
ASSUMPTION IS ABOUT SECTION

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:31.262
EIGHT VOUCHER HOLDERS SO I'M

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:33.064
DOING THIS BILL AND I COULD BE

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.332
WRONG I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:35.834
INTENTION OF THE AUTHOR?

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:38.570
AS A WAY TO TO AVOID THAT IN

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:39.304
GIVE.

02:19:39.370 --> 02:19:42.507
OPPORTUNITY TO A VOUCHER HOLDER

02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:43.742
TO PRESENT THEMSELVES TO THE

02:19:43.808 --> 02:19:45.443
LANDLORD GIVE THEM ALL THE

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:47.512
REASONS I HAVE I HAVE INCOME AND

02:19:47.579 --> 02:19:49.681
AND PERHAPS BREAKDOWN SOME.

02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:53.785
PEOPLE'S VIEWS ABOUT WHO.

02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:56.788
WHO HAS TO RELY ON SECTION --

02:19:56.855 --> 02:19:58.223
EIGHT THIS MANDATE PART I I

02:19:58.289 --> 02:19:59.290
UNDERSTAND.

02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:01.292
FEELING LIKE YOU DON'T WANT

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:02.961
PEOPLE TO ASSUME YOU'RE MAKING

02:20:03.027 --> 02:20:04.829
DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS IT'S

02:20:04.896 --> 02:20:06.131
LIKE WELL THEN DON'T MAKE

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.398
DISCRIMINATORY DECISIONS.

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:10.268
BUT I'M I'M I'M CONFUSED --

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:12.504
WHITE IT'S CALLED A BEING CALLED

02:20:12.570 --> 02:20:13.438
A MANDATE.

02:20:13.505 --> 02:20:14.672
WHEN IT'S NOT A MANDATE IT'S

02:20:14.739 --> 02:20:16.641
JUST MORE BREAKING DOWN THAT --

02:20:16.708 --> 02:20:19.577
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE EXCLUSION OF

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:21.746
IT MIGHT DOT.

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:23.214
IS THAT HOW THE AUTHOR SEES THE

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:24.415
BILL I'M KIND I'M JUST KIND OF

02:20:24.482 --> 02:20:26.751
CONFUSED AT THAT I THINK THAT'S

02:20:26.818 --> 02:20:28.920
EXACTLY OKAY POINTS IN THE THE

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:30.054
OPPOSITION.

02:20:30.121 --> 02:20:32.824
IS CHARACTERIZING IT IN A NARROW.

02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:34.692
AS A POTENTIAL MANDATE UNDER

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:36.327
HYPOTHETICAL AND WHAT THE AUTHOR

02:20:36.394 --> 02:20:37.529
IS SAYING.

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:39.931
IS SORT OF IN THE REAL WORLD

02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:41.399
THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:43.868
APPLICATIONS AND TO MR

02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.270
GALLAGHER'S POINT.

02:20:45.336 --> 02:20:46.371
IF THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:20:46.437 --> 02:20:48.807
APPLICATIONS IN FRONT OF A

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:50.742
LANDLORD AND LANDLORDS SAYS I AM

02:20:50.809 --> 02:20:52.677
NOT RENTING TO THIS PERSON

02:20:52.744 --> 02:20:55.914
SOLELY BECAUSE OF THEY HAD THEIR

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.148
BRINGING SECTION.

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:58.483
EIGHT THEN THAT WOULD BE A

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.352
VIOLATION OF LAW UNDER THIS BILL.

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:03.054
IF EVERYONE ELSE IS BEING

02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:04.656
TREATED EQUALLY.

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:06.624
WHETHER THEY'RE BLACK BROWN

02:21:06.691 --> 02:21:08.193
WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:10.328
FINDING IT OR SEX IT IS FINDING

02:21:10.395 --> 02:21:10.628
IT.

02:21:10.695 --> 02:21:12.597
AND THEY THEIR AGNOSTIC TO ALL

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:16.401
OF THOSE DISCRIMINATORY FACTORS.

02:21:16.467 --> 02:21:19.170
THE CORRECT OR PICK A TENANT AND

02:21:19.237 --> 02:21:21.873
THAT TED IS QUALIFIED THAN.

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.074
THEY'RE DONE.

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.609
AND ALSO I WILL POINT OUT THAT

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:25.143
THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:27.178
PROCESS.

02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:29.314
THAT AT THE IF THE H. FOR

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:32.750
VIOLATIONS WHICH IS A FIRST STEP

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.152
FOR ANY DISPUTE AND THAT'S ONE

02:21:34.219 --> 02:21:35.553
OF THE REASONS THAT WE THAT WE

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:37.155
PROBABLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF

02:21:37.222 --> 02:21:38.523
LITIGATION THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:39.457
OF LITIGATION THERE'S A LOT OF

02:21:39.524 --> 02:21:40.959
FEAR FOR THESE DECISIONS BUT THE

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:41.626
REALITY.

02:21:41.693 --> 02:21:43.795
IS THIS IS A COMPLEX WORLD AND

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:45.663
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:46.464
WITH THE BILL IS TRYING TO MAKE

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:48.233
SURE WHICH I AGREE WITH THAT I

02:21:48.299 --> 02:21:51.269
AGREE THAT IT IS NOT A MANDATE.

02:21:51.336 --> 02:21:52.837
BECAUSE THAT.

02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:54.539
LANDLORD HAS THE ABILITY TO HAVE

02:21:54.606 --> 02:21:57.509
SOME FLEXIBILITY IN AND TO TO

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:58.977
MAKE DECISIONS BUT IF THAT

02:21:59.043 --> 02:22:00.211
DECISION IS MADE.

02:22:00.278 --> 02:22:02.313
EXPRESSLY BECAUSE OF A SECTION

02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:03.681
EIGHT VOUCHER UNDER THIS BILL

02:22:03.748 --> 02:22:06.184
THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL OTHER THAN

02:22:06.251 --> 02:22:07.619
THAT THEY HAVE [inaudible]

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:12.290
BROAD DISCRETION.

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:13.591
THIS GALLAGHER AND HOW IT IS A

02:22:13.658 --> 02:22:14.826
VERY QUICK I THINK THAT'S THE

02:22:14.893 --> 02:22:16.027
PROBLEM.

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:18.096
WITH THE BILL THOUGH RIGHT IS IT

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:19.430
FOR SAYING THAT.

02:22:19.497 --> 02:22:20.531
WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHOICE

02:22:20.598 --> 02:22:22.734
TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:23.401
OR NOT.

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:25.837
AND YET ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL

02:22:25.904 --> 02:22:27.772
YOU DECIDE -- I'M NOT GONNA GO

02:22:27.839 --> 02:22:29.741
THERE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:31.609
PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM.

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:33.845
AND WORSE AND WE'RE SAYING HEY

02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:35.280
IF YOU DON'T MAKE THAT CHOICE.

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:36.247
YOU KNOW YOU'RE.

02:22:36.314 --> 02:22:38.149
LIABLE.

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:39.317
THEN THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:40.985
HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE RIGHT

02:22:41.052 --> 02:22:43.321
OR OTHERWISE SUBJECT THEMSELVES

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:45.189
LIABILITY THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

02:22:45.256 --> 02:22:46.324
THE PROBLEM.

02:22:46.391 --> 02:22:47.458
THAT'S NOT THE BILL SAYS THE

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:50.662
BILL SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T DENY ME

02:22:50.728 --> 02:22:53.131
FROM APPLYING THE BILL DOESN'T

02:22:53.197 --> 02:22:54.899
GO SO FAR AS TO SAY.

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:56.834
YOU MUST SELECT ME THE BILL

YOU CAN'T HAVE A SIGN THAT SAYS

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:04.175
NO SECTION.

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:06.110
EIGHT AND IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:08.146
YOU HAVE TWO APPLICANTS THREE

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.414

THEM TODAY.

02:39:12.342 --> 02:39:14.344
THE FIRST IS THAT BORE THE

THIRTY SOMETHING ODD YEARS THAT.

02:39:16.113 --> 02:39:17.648
ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS HAVE BEEN

02:39:17.714 --> 02:39:19.316
LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA THE

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:20.851
LICENSING LAWS REQUIRED A

02:39:24.721 --> 02:39:26.790
WOULD CHANGE THAT TO A LICENSED

02:39:26.857 --> 02:39:28.859
VETERINARIAN NEITHER OF THE TWO

02:39:28.926 --> 02:39:30.460

VETERINARIAN.

02:39:45.342 --> 02:39:47.511
WHICH IT IS A LITTLE VAGUE I

02:39:47.577 --> 02:39:48.612
WOULD SAY BECAUSE IT SIDES TO

02:39:48.679 --> 02:39:50.414
ALL OF THE VETERINARY PRACTICES

02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:52.082
ACT WHICH USES THAT WORD.

02:39:52.149 --> 02:39:55.352

02:39:55.419 --> 02:39:58.789
TO REQUIRE -- PRESENTS -- AND

02:39:58.855 --> 02:40:01.858

TO DRAW BLOOD FROM AN ANIMAL

02:40:02.526 --> 02:40:04.127
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY YOU DON'T

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:05.729
NEED A DOCTOR TO TAKE BLOOD FROM

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:07.264

THAT TO TAKE BLOOD FROM.

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.435
AN ANIMAL.

02:40:11.501 --> 02:40:12.302
THE SECOND CONCERN WE HAVE HAS

02:40:12.369 --> 02:40:12.903
TO DO WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:16.273

02:40:40.097 --> 02:40:42.899
LEGAL MEASURES.

02:40:42.966 --> 02:40:44.134

MY HUNDRED WERE ARRESTED.

02:40:48.305 --> 02:40:49.706
THAT'S THE KIND OF INTIMIDATION

02:40:49.773 --> 02:40:50.841
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE

02:40:50.907 --> 02:40:52.175
PAST AND THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:40:52.242 --> 02:40:53.810

HAVE BEEN PROTECTED.

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:56.313
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT CDFA

ON THE PROGRAMS BUT THERE ARE

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:02.419
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:29.613
CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING IT RIGHT

02:41:29.679 --> 02:41:30.914
FROM THE BEGINNING.

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:31.548

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:45.222
ONES THAT ARE HERE RIGHT NOW

02:42:45.288 --> 02:42:47.390

02:42:47.457 --> 02:42:49.960
THAT ALL OF US WOULD WANT TO

02:42:50.026 --> 02:42:52.929

YEAH IT WAS IN THAT DIRE

02:42:55.665 --> 02:42:58.001
SITUATION -- SO.

02:42:58.068 --> 02:42:59.669
I I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING

02:42:59.736 --> 02:43:01.505

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:08.278
THE INDUSTRY THAT WE HAVE -- IN

02:43:08.345 --> 02:43:11.214
THE STATE RIGHT NOW -- AND I

02:43:11.281 --> 02:43:12.482

THAT WERE BROUGHT UP -- BY THE

02:43:16.853 --> 02:43:17.888
OPPOSITION IT SOUNDS LIKE

02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:20.290
THEY'RE OPEN TO THIS CONCEPT A

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:21.958

WHOLE TIME WITH MISTER LEE ****

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:08.705

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.540
LAID OUT ON ISSUE ONE WE'RE

02:44:10.607 --> 02:44:11.341
GONNA BE ADDRESSING IN THE AG

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:13.443
AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WAS NOT

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:15.745
APPROPRIATE. TO DO IT IN THIS

02:44:15.812 --> 02:44:17.847
COMMITTEE AND I RESPECT THE

02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:19.583
CHAIR FOR YOU KNOW JUST.

02:44:19.649 --> 02:44:20.850
WORKING IN HIS AREA OF

02:44:20.917 --> 02:44:22.419
JURISDICTION A LINE THAT TO THE

02:44:22.485 --> 02:44:23.420
AG COMMITTEE SO I'M ASSUMING

02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:25.555
WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT RESOLVED

02:44:25.622 --> 02:44:27.324
AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TERMS

02:44:27.390 --> 02:44:29.392
OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IT HAS

02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:30.126
NOTHING TO DO WITH PEOPLE AND

02:44:30.193 --> 02:44:31.928
ONLY HAS TO DO WITH THE HEALTH

02:44:31.995 --> 02:44:33.897
OF THE ANIMALS -- THERE'S A LOT

02:44:33.964 --> 02:44:35.699
OF POTENTIALLY MISINFORMATION

02:44:35.765 --> 02:44:37.901
ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY OUT THERE

02:44:37.968 --> 02:44:41.805
AND THE REASON WHY THEY'RE SO --

02:44:41.871 --> 02:44:43.540
THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES IS

02:44:43.607 --> 02:44:44.441
BECAUSE THERE THERE IS NO

02:44:44.507 --> 02:44:47.344
TRANSPARENCY AND SO WE'RE JUST.

02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:48.712
MAKING ADVANCE WOULD BE MADE

02:44:48.778 --> 02:44:51.781
AVAILABLE -- INFORMATION ON THAT

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:53.450
THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMALS AND

02:44:53.516 --> 02:44:54.818
FRANKLY I THINK MORE

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:56.686
TRANSPARENCY ACTUALLY HELPS TO

02:44:56.753 --> 02:44:58.255
SEND INDUSTRY DOES NOT HINDER IT

02:44:58.321 --> 02:45:01.524
SO.

02:45:01.591 --> 02:45:04.261
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND THIS

02:45:04.327 --> 02:45:05.729
IS TOUGH.

02:45:05.795 --> 02:45:07.197
I HAVE A VERY BRIEFLY I I WOULD

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:07.964
JUST SAY THAT -- IT'S NOT

02:45:08.031 --> 02:45:11.234
TYPICAL TO EXPOSE -- LICENSING

02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:13.803
AND INSPECTION RECORDS -- AND IT

02:45:13.870 --> 02:45:15.939
IS TYPICAL -- TO PROVIDE

02:45:16.006 --> 02:45:17.307
AGGREGATED DATA BUT THAT'S A

02:45:17.374 --> 02:45:18.541
LITTLE BIT OF AN ISSUE IN THIS

02:45:18.608 --> 02:45:20.176
INDUSTRY WHERE THERE ARE ONLY

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:23.513
TWO COMPETITORS -- AND FINALLY I

02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:28.685
I WOULD SAY THAT THE IN ORDER TO

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:30.520
BE LICENSED AN APPLICANT HAS TO

02:45:30.587 --> 02:45:31.988
PROVIDE THE PROTOCOLS WHICH IS

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:34.224
BASICALLY THE STEP BY STEP EVERY

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.325
ASPECT OF THE BUSINESS IT'S A

02:45:35.392 --> 02:45:37.427
ROAD MAP FOR COMPETITORS AND

02:45:37.494 --> 02:45:40.163
OTHERS -- TO COMPETE WITH THEM

02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:41.531
AND WE THINK THAT'S NOT

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:42.499
APPROPRIATE TO BE DISCLOSED

02:45:42.565 --> 02:45:44.100
EITHER SO THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIC

02:45:44.167 --> 02:45:46.169
THINGS WE WANT TO PROTECT

02:45:46.236 --> 02:45:48.371
OTHERWISE -- I I THINK WE'RE

02:45:48.438 --> 02:45:50.273
VERY CLOSE TO AGREEMENT ON THAT

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.342
OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK THERE

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:53.943
ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES.

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:54.811
THIS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS I

02:45:54.878 --> 02:45:56.880
MEAN OBVIOUSLY AND WE DID NOT

02:45:56.946 --> 02:45:58.581
HAVE THOSE BUT THOSE P. R. A.

02:45:58.648 --> 02:46:00.016

TATE THE DELIVERED OF PROCESS.

03:07:56.465 --> 03:07:58.033
TO DO SO I CONDUCTED THE FIRST

03:07:58.100 --> 03:08:00.235
MOCK JURY STUDY EVER INCLUDED

03:08:00.302 --> 03:08:01.269
FELLING JURORS AND NON FELL

03:08:01.336 --> 03:08:03.305
INJURES RESULTS INDICATE THE

03:08:03.372 --> 03:08:04.573
CONVICTED FELONS APPROACH

03:08:04.640 --> 03:08:05.807
DELIBERATIONS THOUGHTFULLY AND

03:08:05.874 --> 03:08:07.209
ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

03:08:07.275 --> 03:08:08.510
ON TO THEORETICALLY DERIVED

03:08:08.577 --> 03:08:10.379
MEASURES OF DELIBERATION QUALITY

03:08:10.445 --> 03:08:12.648
TIME SPOKEN AND RECOLLECTING HER

03:08:12.714 --> 03:08:13.649
RECOLLECTION OF CASE FACTS

OUTSCORED THEIR NON FILLING

03:08:16.284 --> 03:08:17.386
COUNTERPARTS.

03:08:17.452 --> 03:08:18.620
WHEN ALL THE MEASURES OF

03:08:18.687 --> 03:08:20.122
DELIBERATION QUALITY FOLGERS IN

03:08:20.188 --> 03:08:21.289
NON FELL INJURES DID NOT DIFFER

03:08:21.356 --> 03:08:22.758
STATISTICALLY?

03:08:22.824 --> 03:08:23.925
THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THE

03:08:23.992 --> 03:08:25.527
CONVICTED FELONS AT A MINIMUM DO

03:08:25.594 --> 03:08:26.828
NOT UNDERMINE IN MAY IN FACT

03:08:26.895 --> 03:08:29.064
ENHANCE JURY DELIBERATIONS.

03:08:29.131 --> 03:08:30.198
ACCORDINGLY JURISDICTIONS A BAR

03:08:30.265 --> 03:08:31.833
US FROM JURY SERVICE MAY I

03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:32.901
NECESSARILY DISCARDED VALUABLE

03:08:32.968 --> 03:08:37.606
VIEWPOINT IN THE JURY'S QUEST

03:08:37.673 --> 03:08:38.140
FOR JUSTICE.

03:08:38.206 --> 03:08:38.974
THE CHARACTER RATIONALE ALSO

03:08:39.041 --> 03:08:39.875
FACES THE CONTEXTUAL CHALLENGE

03:08:39.941 --> 03:08:40.709
AS I ALLUDED TO THE START OF MY

03:08:40.776 --> 03:08:43.045
TESTIMONY CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF

03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:43.845
TWENTY NINE JURISDICTIONS WHICH

03:08:43.912 --> 03:08:44.880
A CONVICTED FELON CAN

03:08:44.946 --> 03:08:46.815
SUCCESSFULLY BECOME A MEMBER OF

03:08:46.882 --> 03:08:47.115
STATE BAR.

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:48.984
BUT IS FOREVER EXCLUDED FROM THE

03:08:49.051 --> 03:08:49.918
JURY POOL.

03:08:49.985 --> 03:08:51.887
THIS IN MY OPINION STRETHES THE

03:08:51.953 --> 03:08:52.654
BOUNDS OF LOGIC.

03:08:52.721 --> 03:08:54.089
WHILE BOTH LEGAL ROLES REQUIRE

03:08:54.156 --> 03:08:55.490
UP STANDING MORAL CHARACTER

03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:56.825
CALIFORNIA ALLOWS FOR THE

03:08:56.892 --> 03:08:58.627
PROSPECT OF REDEMPTION IN THE

03:08:58.694 --> 03:08:59.961
CONTEXT OF ENTRY TO THE LEGAL

03:09:00.028 --> 03:09:00.796
PROFESSION.

03:09:00.862 --> 03:09:02.197
GET IGNORES THAT POSSIBILITY

03:09:02.264 --> 03:09:04.266
WHEN IT COMES TO JURY SERVICE A

03:09:04.332 --> 03:09:06.001
CRUCIAL CIVIC COMMITMENT.

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:07.502
SO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WELL I

03:09:07.569 --> 03:09:09.471
CAN DEFEND A CITIZEN FACING THE

03:09:09.538 --> 03:09:11.006
ULTIMATE PENALTY DEATH.

03:09:11.073 --> 03:09:12.541
I AM NOT PERMITTED NOT TRUSTED

03:09:12.607 --> 03:09:16.211
ENOUGH BY THIS STATE TO DECIDE

03:09:16.278 --> 03:09:18.413
EXAMPLE IN THIS PLACE FENCE.

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:21.116

THE ONLY JURISDICTION THAT

03:09:30.726 --> 03:09:32.294
ALLOWS CONVICTED FELONS TO SERVE

03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:33.328
STATE OF MAINE.

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:34.830
WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT SUBJECT

03:09:34.896 --> 03:09:36.364
SPOKE OF THEIR INCLUSION IN JURY

03:09:36.431 --> 03:09:38.600

THESE THINGS THIS INCLUSION

03:09:48.243 --> 03:09:49.711
TRIGGERED CRIMINALS ASSISTANCE

03:09:49.778 --> 03:09:51.847

AS WE KNOW AND IS INDICATED TO A

03:20:05.360 --> 03:20:07.695
VERY WELL IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS

03:20:07.762 --> 03:20:09.263
THAT USING JUST THE DMV AND

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:10.798
VOTER ROLLS EXCLUDES.

03:20:10.865 --> 03:20:12.233
A LARGE SWATH OF OUR POPULATION

03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:13.668
VERTICALLY LOWER INCOME PEOPLE

03:20:13.735 --> 03:20:15.403
OF COLOR AND AGAIN I THINK THE

03:20:15.470 --> 03:20:16.704
GOAL IS TO HAVE.

03:20:16.771 --> 03:20:19.407
A JURY THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF

03:20:19.474 --> 03:20:21.376
THE COMMUNITY -- IT INTO WHICH

03:20:21.442 --> 03:20:22.977
ARE BEING IMPANELED -- AND WE

03:20:23.044 --> 03:20:24.078
KNOW THAT OF HISTORICALLY THAT'S

03:20:24.145 --> 03:20:25.246
REALLY NEVER BEEN THE CASE

03:20:25.313 --> 03:20:26.814
ALTHOUGH THAT THINK WE'RE ALWAYS

03:20:26.881 --> 03:20:28.149
TRYING TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION

03:20:28.216 --> 03:20:30.084
I THINK HAVING THE TAX FILING

03:20:30.151 --> 03:20:32.019
STATUS IS DEFINITELY A MOVE.

03:20:32.086 --> 03:20:33.755
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- TO

03:20:33.821 --> 03:20:36.724
INCREASE APPLE AND YOU KNOW

03:20:36.791 --> 03:20:38.126
HAVING WORKS ADOPTED PUBLIC

03:20:38.192 --> 03:20:39.961
DEFENDER FOR THAT IN YEARS AND

03:20:40.027 --> 03:20:41.462
IN PANEL DANGER IS MYSELF -- I

03:20:41.529 --> 03:20:43.765
WILL SAY THAT -- FIRST OF ALL --

03:20:43.831 --> 03:20:46.167
BUT ANYONE THAT IS ON PAROLE OR

03:20:46.234 --> 03:20:53.541
PROBATION -- THAT SHOWS UP FOR

03:20:53.608 --> 03:20:55.543
JURY SERVICE AND IS WILLING TO

03:20:55.610 --> 03:20:57.612
DO THEIR CIVIC DUTY AS CITIZENS --

03:20:57.678 --> 03:20:58.713
WE SHOULD APPLAUD THAT WE SUPPLY

03:20:58.780 --> 03:21:00.314
THE FACT THAT THEY WANT TO BE BE

03:21:00.381 --> 03:21:01.716
INTEGRATED AND REHABILITATED IN

03:21:01.783 --> 03:21:02.984
SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY

03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:03.751
WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

03:21:03.818 --> 03:21:05.420
EVEN IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF.

03:21:05.486 --> 03:21:07.488
THAT LED THEM TO THE CONVICTION.

03:21:07.555 --> 03:21:08.389
I THAT'S IN SOME WAYS A TRUST IN

03:21:08.456 --> 03:21:10.425
THE SYSTEM THAT MANY OF US DON'T

03:21:10.491 --> 03:21:11.359
EVEN HAVE.

03:21:11.426 --> 03:21:12.794
THAT THAT MAY NOT HAVE TONY

03:21:12.860 --> 03:21:14.362
CONVICTIONS.

03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:15.863
LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT

03:21:15.930 --> 03:21:17.765
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT

03:21:17.832 --> 03:21:20.635
SOMEONE COULD BE EXCUSED -- BUT

03:21:20.701 --> 03:21:22.103
IT'S THERE -- A PART OF THE JURY

03:21:22.170 --> 03:21:25.540
POOL -- CERTAINLY FOR BIAS --

03:21:25.606 --> 03:21:30.912
BUT IF HE IF A FABLE UP.

03:21:30.978 --> 03:21:32.013
IS ONE THAT HAS A FELONY

03:21:32.079 --> 03:21:34.449
CONVICTION -- BUT CHOOSES TO

03:21:34.515 --> 03:21:36.651
REVEAL BY S. CLEARLY -- THEY'LL

03:21:36.717 --> 03:21:37.785
BE EXCUSE JUST LIKE A VICTIM OF

03:21:37.852 --> 03:21:39.520
A CRIME ALTHOUGH I WILL TELL YOU

03:21:39.587 --> 03:21:41.589
ABOUT VICTIM OF CRIMES IMPANELED.

03:21:41.656 --> 03:21:43.024
AS A AS PART OF A JURY BECAUSE

03:21:43.090 --> 03:21:43.624
THEY'VE INDICATED THEY THEY

03:21:43.691 --> 03:21:44.258
DON'T THEY THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

03:21:44.325 --> 03:21:45.393
BIAS THAT THEY CAN BE FAIR AND

03:21:45.460 --> 03:21:47.328
IMPARTIAL AND IF THE ONE THAT

03:21:47.395 --> 03:21:48.296
HAS A CONVICTION CAN INDICATE

03:21:48.362 --> 03:21:49.063
THAT THEY'LL BE FAIR AND

03:21:49.130 --> 03:21:49.730
IMPARTIAL.

03:21:49.797 --> 03:21:50.631
THEY SHOULD BE IN THE

03:21:50.698 --> 03:21:51.999
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE NOW THEY

03:21:52.066 --> 03:21:55.069
CAN STILL BE EXCUSED -- BUT YOU

03:21:55.136 --> 03:21:56.237
KNOW BY A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE --

03:21:56.304 --> 03:21:57.872
AND ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS I

03:21:57.939 --> 03:21:59.273
KNOW WASN'T NESTLE DISCUSSED

03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:01.342
YOUR BILL WAS REFERRED TO IN THE

03:22:01.409 --> 03:22:03.277
STAFF ANALYSIS IS HARDSHIPS --

03:22:03.344 --> 03:22:04.946
MANY MANY JURORS ESPECIALLY LOW

03:22:05.012 --> 03:22:06.481
INCOM JURORS DO NOT SERVE

03:22:06.547 --> 03:22:08.382
BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.

03:22:08.449 --> 03:22:11.452
AND I THINK THAT BY EXPANDING

03:22:11.519 --> 03:22:13.454
THE POOLOF THOSE THAT

03:22:13.521 --> 03:22:14.922
PRESUMABLY.

03:22:14.989 --> 03:22:17.024
WOULD BE LOWER INCOME BUT BUT

03:22:17.091 --> 03:22:18.292
THE SERVING JURORS ESPECIALLY

03:22:18.359 --> 03:22:19.093
THOSE THAT MAY HAPPEN ANY

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:21.462
CONVICTIONS ARE EXPANDING -- THE

03:22:21.529 --> 03:22:22.497
ABILITY TO HAVE A JURY THAT

03:22:22.563 --> 03:22:24.298
ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE COMMUNITY

03:22:24.365 --> 03:22:26.834
IN WHICH A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT IS

03:22:26.901 --> 03:22:27.869
ON TRIAL.

03:22:27.935 --> 03:22:31.372
AND SO I I THINK THAT YES YOU

03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:33.374
KNOW THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF

03:22:33.441 --> 03:22:34.609
FEAR THAT COULD BE SEWN INTO

03:22:34.675 --> 03:22:36.544
THIS BUT THE REALITY IS.

03:22:36.611 --> 03:22:38.513
THAT -- IF WE TRULY WANT TO

03:22:38.579 --> 03:22:41.415
BELIEVE -- AND ONE DOES THAT GET

03:22:41.482 --> 03:22:43.918
RELEASED TO BE SUCCESSFUL UPON

03:22:43.985 --> 03:22:45.152
GETTING RELEASED THEN WE SHOULD

03:22:45.219 --> 03:22:47.421
OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE.

03:22:47.488 --> 03:22:49.156
IN THE SAME MANNER THAT WE DO SO

03:22:49.223 --> 03:22:51.259
MANY OTHERS AND SO I'M VERY

03:22:51.325 --> 03:22:52.927
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I

03:22:52.994 --> 03:22:54.095
THINK THAT IT'S IT'S ABSOLUTELY

03:22:54.161 --> 03:22:55.630
THE RIGHT STEP PRESS THE TAKEN

03:22:55.696 --> 03:22:57.265
CALIFORNIA'S BEEN BEHIND.

03:22:57.331 --> 03:22:58.533
I THINK IT'S OKAY IF WE TAKE A

03:22:58.599 --> 03:22:59.700
STEP IN ACTUALLY BEING A

03:22:59.767 --> 03:23:08.976
LEADERSHIP ROLE OF IT AT THIS

03:23:09.043 --> 03:23:10.444
TIME AS WELL.

03:23:10.511 --> 03:23:12.580
THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS

03:23:12.647 --> 03:23:13.080
COMMENTS.

03:23:13.147 --> 03:23:14.682
THIS CHIP.

03:23:14.749 --> 03:23:16.050
FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR

03:23:16.117 --> 03:23:16.884
FOR BEING SUCH A STALWART

03:23:16.951 --> 03:23:18.352
CHAMPION FOR PROGRESSIVE COLONEL

03:23:18.419 --> 03:23:19.487
JUSTICE REFORM I THINK OF

03:23:19.554 --> 03:23:20.354
SUPPORTING YOU AND EVERYTHING --

03:23:20.421 --> 03:23:22.356
THAT YOU HAVE PUT FORTH I WILL

03:23:22.423 --> 03:23:23.291
SAY AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED AS A

03:23:23.357 --> 03:23:23.958
FORMER DA THIS BILL DOES GIVE ME

03:23:24.025 --> 03:23:25.426
A LITTLE BIT OF HEARTBURN --

03:23:25.493 --> 03:23:27.194
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS SET

03:23:27.261 --> 03:23:29.797
THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL

03:23:29.864 --> 03:23:31.365
DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S WRITTEN IS

03:23:31.432 --> 03:23:34.101
THAT -- PROSECUTORS WILL USE

03:23:34.168 --> 03:23:36.404
THEIR PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES --

03:23:36.470 --> 03:23:38.272
TO STRIKE -- FELONS WHO ARE IN

03:23:38.339 --> 03:23:40.107
THE JURY POOL I AND AT SOME

03:23:40.174 --> 03:23:42.944
LEVELS -- IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY

03:23:43.010 --> 03:23:45.446
DISADVANTAGE -- THE D. A.'S AND

03:23:45.513 --> 03:23:46.714
SO -- AS WE DISCUSSED I'M

03:23:46.781 --> 03:23:48.215
WILLING TO PROVIDE YOUR COURTESY

03:23:48.282 --> 03:23:50.885
VOTE TODAY MY HOPE IS THAT THE

03:23:50.952 --> 03:23:53.054
TWO PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO TO

03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:53.955
DISCUSS THIS I KNOW.

03:23:54.021 --> 03:23:56.157
THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION AROUND --

03:23:56.223 --> 03:23:58.426
POTENTIALLY ALIGNING -- THE

03:23:58.492 --> 03:23:59.694
REQUIREMENTS HERE WITH VOTING

03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:01.729
REQUIREMENTS I THINK THAT IS --

03:24:01.796 --> 03:24:03.364
AN INTERESTING PATH TO CONSIDER --

03:24:03.431 --> 03:24:04.599
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING

03:24:04.665 --> 03:24:05.566
ABOUT THE DISCUSSION I THINK

03:24:05.633 --> 03:24:07.535
THERE'S SOMETHING HERE -- BUT I

03:24:07.602 --> 03:24:09.837
I DEFINITELY HOPE THAT WE CAN

03:24:09.904 --> 03:24:11.572
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO ADDRESS SOME

03:24:11.639 --> 03:24:12.907
OF THE CONCERNS AND REYES TO

03:24:12.974 --> 03:24:14.842
MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE DON'T

03:24:14.909 --> 03:24:16.644
HAVE THE THE IMMEDIATE

03:24:16.711 --> 03:24:18.646
HANDICAPPING OF THE PEOPLE STATE

03:24:18.713 --> 03:24:22.950
A CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES -- TO

03:24:23.017 --> 03:24:26.487
SELECTING JURORS [inaudible]

03:24:26.554 --> 03:24:27.355
THIS FEATURE.

03:24:27.421 --> 03:24:28.522
I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL

03:24:28.589 --> 03:24:30.424
TODAY AS WELL -- BUT I I DO WANT

03:24:30.491 --> 03:24:31.926
TO ENCOURAGE THE ARE THE SENATOR

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:32.426
TO CONSIDER SOME OF THE

03:24:32.493 --> 03:24:33.694
AMENDMENTS AT THAT WE HEARD

03:24:33.761 --> 03:24:36.697
TODAY I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE

03:24:36.764 --> 03:24:37.098
KIND OF EXPENSIVE.

03:24:37.164 --> 03:24:38.432
THANKS MUCH.

03:24:38.499 --> 03:24:41.135
THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW. FIVE MEN

03:24:41.202 --> 03:24:43.804
MIGHT RESPOND BRIEFLY TO THOSE

03:24:43.871 --> 03:24:47.008
COMMENTS AROUND THE AMENDMENTS --

03:24:47.074 --> 03:24:48.609
WELL IT'S STRUCTURE CLOSER YES

03:24:48.676 --> 03:24:49.577
YOU MAY [inaudible]

03:24:49.644 --> 03:24:52.046
OKAY.

03:24:52.113 --> 03:24:54.782
I'M AS MISTER MORRISON MORSE

03:24:54.849 --> 03:24:55.616
FROM THE DA ASSOCIATIONS

03:24:55.683 --> 03:24:56.784
INDICATED MY OFFICE SANDAY

03:24:56.851 --> 03:24:58.552
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IN

03:24:58.619 --> 03:25:01.122
DISCUSSION -- WE CALIFORNIA.

03:25:01.188 --> 03:25:02.790
VOTING RIGHTS.

03:25:02.857 --> 03:25:06.527
BUT EXTEND.

03:25:06.594 --> 03:25:07.762
TO PERSONS WHO ARE FORMERLY

03:25:07.828 --> 03:25:10.164
CONVICTED OF A FELONY BUT WHO

03:25:10.231 --> 03:25:13.567
ARE NO LONGER ON ROLL.

03:25:13.634 --> 03:25:16.570
ON NOT SURE IF IT'S ALSO PRO OR

03:25:16.637 --> 03:25:18.239
PROBATION OR PURCHASE ONE BUT

03:25:18.305 --> 03:25:21.142
WHAT I AM WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING

03:25:21.208 --> 03:25:23.110
IS AND I'M VERY OPEN TO

03:25:23.177 --> 03:25:24.412
POTENTIALLY.

03:25:24.478 --> 03:25:26.380
MODIFYING THE BILL SO THAT IT

03:25:26.447 --> 03:25:28.349
REFLECTS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH

03:25:28.416 --> 03:25:29.650
OUR VOTING RIGHTS.

03:25:29.717 --> 03:25:32.420
NOW THE OTHER ISSUES AROUND --

03:25:32.486 --> 03:25:34.889
EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES

03:25:34.955 --> 03:25:37.425
OF OF PEOPLE I THINK IT'S MUCH

03:25:37.491 --> 03:25:39.160
MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE IF WE

03:25:39.226 --> 03:25:40.761
RAISE FOR EXAMPLE.

03:25:40.828 --> 03:25:42.363
THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION

03:25:42.430 --> 03:25:45.066
CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

03:25:45.132 --> 03:25:48.369
IF WE HAVE A PERSON WHO WAS --

03:25:48.436 --> 03:25:50.204
HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF A VIOLENT

03:25:50.271 --> 03:25:53.474
FELONY WE COULD HAVE VIOLENCE IN

03:25:53.541 --> 03:25:54.508
THE COURT ROOM.

03:25:54.575 --> 03:25:58.679
DID THE REALITY IS THAT -- NOT

03:25:58.746 --> 03:26:00.014
ALL VIOLENT PEOPLE.

03:26:00.081 --> 03:26:04.452
ARE ARRESTED OR CONVICTED -- AND

03:26:04.518 --> 03:26:06.954
STEW. FOR US TO ASSUME THAT

03:26:07.021 --> 03:26:08.823
EXCLUDING ONE CATEGORY WOULD

03:26:08.889 --> 03:26:10.458
SOMEHOW GUARANTEE THAT WE DID

03:26:10.524 --> 03:26:12.326
NOT HAVE PEOPLE ON JURIES THAT

03:26:12.393 --> 03:26:15.129
HAVE A TENDENCY TOWARDS VIOLENCE

03:26:15.196 --> 03:26:17.164
IS A VERY INACCURATE NOTION --

03:26:17.231 --> 03:26:18.499
ALL THAT THE FELONY CONVICTION

03:26:18.566 --> 03:26:22.269
REPRESENTS IS THAT THAT PERSON

03:26:22.336 --> 03:26:26.107
WAS ACTUALLY -- CONVICTED -- WE

03:26:26.173 --> 03:26:27.475
KNOW THAT THERE'S IF THERE'S

03:26:27.541 --> 03:26:29.477
MUCH VIOLENCE THAT NEVER EVEN

03:26:29.543 --> 03:26:32.613
GETS REPORTED AS A CRIME SO --

03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:35.883
AND ADDITIONALLY IF WE TAKE THE

03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:41.422
THE THE REFERENCE -- TO IT'S THE

03:26:41.489 --> 03:26:42.990
REGISTRY OF SEX OFFENDERS.

03:26:43.057 --> 03:26:44.692
WE COULD HAVE MANY RAPISTS THAT

03:26:44.759 --> 03:26:46.026
ARE SITTING ON A JURY POOL

03:26:46.093 --> 03:26:48.829
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF REPORTED

03:26:48.896 --> 03:26:52.133
RAPES IS SO TINY.

03:26:52.199 --> 03:26:54.201
AS TO BE ABSURD NOW I DON'T

03:26:54.268 --> 03:26:56.137
BRING THAT UP TO SAY THAT I

03:26:56.203 --> 03:26:58.305
WELCOME A RAPIST ON A JURY POOL

03:26:58.372 --> 03:26:58.639
NO.

03:26:58.706 --> 03:27:00.341
BUT I'M BRING IT UP BECAUSE OF

03:27:00.407 --> 03:27:03.410
