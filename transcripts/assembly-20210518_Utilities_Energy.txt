ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY WHERE WE ARE HERE FOR AN OVERSIGHT HEARING TO DISCUSS SUMMER READING THIS SPECIFICALLY HOW ELECTRIC SYSTEM RELIABILITY HAS BEEN PRIORITIZE SINCE THE ROTATING. OUTAGES LAST AUGUST. WHERE WE BEGAN I HAVE SOME HOUSEKEEPING TO GO OVER. WE ARE PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING- HERE AT THE CAPITOL WEARING MASKS AT ALL TIMES AND THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING NOT ONLY IN THIS CHAMBER BUT THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SPACE. SO OUR PANELISTS WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. WE ALSO HAVE ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI PARTICIPATING REMOTELY. WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING THE CALL IN DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT SEGMENT OF THIS HEARING THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IT IS AREA CODE. 877-692-8957 IN THE ACCESS CODE IS TWO FOUR TWO. SIX TWO THREE SEVEN YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL AS ON THE TV SCREEN ADDITIONALLY I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY. IN ORDER TO HEAR AS MUCH FROM THE PUBLIC WITHIN THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WE WILL NOT PERMIT CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS OR OTHERWISE IN PEACE THE ORDERLY CONDUCT OF THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDING ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAMBER. OR REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED. BEFORE WE BEGIN I WANT TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CLARIFYING NOTE TO AVOID CONFUSION. TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON A ROTATING OUTAGES. WHICH ARE CALLED BY THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME TO HELP EASE DEMAND ON THE ELECTRIC GRID AND CONTROL THE RISK OF A LARGER OUTAGE OCCURRING. THE ROTATING OUTAGES LAST AUGUST LASTED A FEW HOURS. AND ROTATED FROM AREA TO AREA SO NO SINGLE NEIGHBORHOODS ELECTRICITY WAS DOWN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THESE OUTAGES ARE UNIQUE FROM PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. OR PBS'S WHICH ARE CALLED BY THE UTILITIES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. IN THOSE OUTAGES POWER IS SHUT OFF ON AT RISK CIRCUITS UNTIL THE WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS HIGH WIND FOR LOW HUMIDITY IS LESSENED AND THE RISK OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SPARKING A WILDFIRE. IS REDUCED THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED PS PS IS DURING OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING IN MARCH SO TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON ROTATING OUTAGES. ROTATING OUT IT IS CALLED LAST AUGUST SERVED AS A WARNING ELECTED RELIABILITY MUST NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. WHAT WAS INTOLERABLE WAS THE POWER WAS TURNED OFF WHEN MANY CALIFORNIANS WERE MOST VULNERABLE. IN THE MIDST OF A WEST WHY HE'D STORM THE SAW RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHICH LIMITED PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO SEEK SHELTER AND PUBLIC INDOOR SPACES. AND WITH FIRES RAGING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS I SAID DURING OUR PREVIOUS HEARING ON THE TOPIC IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. THESE OUTAGES WEAKEN OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS OPERATOR AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE SYSTEM RELIABILITY. FOLLOWING THE VENTS LAST AUGUST YOU THREE WROTE TO THE GOVERNOR AND NOTED THAT YOU AND YOUR AGENCIES SHARED IN THE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR WHAT MANY CALIFORNIANS UNNECESSARILY AND DEWART. THIS COMMITTEE HAS ASHLEY BACK TODAY TO DETAIL HOW SERIOUSLY YOU'VE TAKEN THIS RESPONSIBILITY WHAT PREVENTABLE ACTIONS OCCURRED LAST AUGUST THAT HAVE BEEN REMEDIATED FOR THIS UPCOMING SUMMER. AND JUST HOW PREPARED WE ARE. WHEN WE MEET. EVER CHANGING ROAD CONDITIONS. NOT ONLY THIS COMING SUMMER BUT FOR MANY SUMMERS TO COME. I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS SUMMER WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TEST FOR THE STATE I KNOW YOU HAVE RECENTLY STATED HOW YOU ARE GUARDEDLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT MEETING RELIABILITY. BUT WE NEED TO HEAR THAT YOU'VE TURNED EVERY OVER EVERY ROCK. THAT YOU SCOURED EVERY POSSIBILITY I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH A RELIABLE POWER SYSTEM IT UNDERPINS OUR ECONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. PEOPLE DEPEND ON ELECTRICITY FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR WELL BEING. BUT ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA IS AT THE VANGUARD OF RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY THE NATION AND THE WORLD ARE WATCHING TO SEE HOW WE INTEGRATE RENEWABLES BUT ALSO WHETHER WE CAN INSURE RELIABILITY WHILE DOING SO. I KNOW YOU ALL FEEL THE WEIGHT OF AND DEDICATION TO THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AND I WELCOME YOU TODAY TO SHARE THE ACTIONS TAKEN TO ENSURE RELIABILITY THIS COMING SUMMER. AND BEYOND- AND AS I INTRODUCE OUR PANEL A LET ME ALSO NOTE THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF EVENTS GOING ON THIS MORNING OR THIS AFTERNOON- WE HAVE A CAUCUS THAT IS- CONCLUDING HERE SHORTLY AND WE HAVE. BUDGET HEARINGS OF SOME OF OUR MEMBERS MAY BE COMING IN. AS WE BEGIN THIS- THIS HEARING. NOW I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR PANEL. FIRST PRESIDENT BASHER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION FOLLOWED BY SHARE HOT SCHULTZ OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND PRESIDENT MANGER OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE DO APPRECIATE- THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IN THIS INTERIM PERIOD WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY INDIVIDUALLY AND- WITH SOME SMALLER GROUPS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND SO WE ARE GETTING A SENSE THAT. YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY TO CONFIRM THAT AND TO ELABORATE ON THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE UNDER WAY- DRESSING AND SO WE WELCOME YOU NOW AND YOU MAY BEGIN IT WILL START WITH. PRESIDENT BATCH. WELL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND CHAIR HOLDEN AND VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BEFORE I GET UNDER WAY I WANT TO SAY. INDEED W ARE- PRESENTING TO YOU REMOTELY CLEAR AT- THE OFFICES OF THE COMMISSION HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M IN OUR CONFERENCE ROOM I AM JOINED TODAY BY. EDWARD RANDOLPH THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY. AND A BYGRANTED MAN BECAUSE OUR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. ALL THREE OF US HAVE BEEN VACCINATED AND- THEREFORE WE ARE NOT WEARING MASKS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THEM HERE WITH US. AND WE ARE AS YOU CAN SEE- SITTING AT QUITE SOME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER SO THANK YOU. FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A FOLLOW UP TO LAST OCTOBER'S HEARING AND PART OF THE STATE'S PREPARATION FOR THIS UPCOMING SUMMER. I WANT TO ALSO THANK YOU CHAIR FOR EARLIER ACCOMMODATING MY SCHEDULE AND RESCHEDULING OF THIS HEARING TODAY. TWO INDEED ARE THE EIGHTEENTH. ONE OF THE LESSONS FROM LAST AUGUST ISTHAT IT IS CRITICAL WE ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND BETTER INFORM THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES WE SEE AHEAD OF US. THIS AND SUBSEQUENT SUMMERS THE VARIOUS PUBLIC MEETINGS HOSTED BY OUR RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS OVER LEFT LAST YEAR INCLUDING THESE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS HAVE SERVED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT IMPORTANT LESSON AND RESPONSIBILITY. IN THAT SPIRIT WE HAVE ALSO APPRECIATED FULFILLING YOUR REQUEST REVISED MONTHLY REPORTS TO THE COMMITTEE SINCE LAST OCTOBER ON OUR PROGRESS IN EXECUTING THE ACTIONS RECOMMENDED IN THE FINAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE REPORTS OUR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN MOVING ALMOST NONSTOP TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THIS SUMMER WE WROTE TO THE GOVERNOR LAST AUGUST THAT YOU MENTIONED MR CHAIRMAN THAT WE SHARED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAD WHAT MANY. CALIFORNIANS AND NECESSARILY IN TOWARD AND WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO IMPROVING THE STATE'S POSITION TO WITHSTAND A SIMILAR EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS IN THE FUTURE AND TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THOSE WE SERVE. MEETING THIS COMMITMENT HAS REQUIRED AN ENHANCED LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND PROBLEM SOLVING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE AND THANKS FOR THE COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT THE LEADERSHIP AND THE STAFF OF OUR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN SO DOING. TODAY YOU WILL HEAR OF THE NUMEROUS TASKS EACH OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS HAVE COMPLETED TO BETTER POSITION THE STATE. AND THOUGH NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE WEATHER AND RATE RESOURCE CONDITIONS ON A GIVEN DATE WITH A 100% CERTAINTY WE KNOW WE ARE ARE IN A STRONGER POSITION THAN WE WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR. FOR THE CBC'S PART WE HAVE FACILITATED THE DIRECT PROCUREMENT AND CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT HAVE. MEANINGFULLY INCREASED DEMAND AND SUPPLY SIDE RESOURCES FOR THIS SUMMER AND NEXT SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE ORDERED INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO PROCURE A MINIMUM OF AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT 5% OF RESOURCES FOR ALL CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TERRITORIES REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE INCREASE OF THE PLANNING RESOURCE MARGIN FROM THE EXISTING 15% TO SEVENTEEN POINT UTILITIES TO PILOT AN EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT WILL GIVE DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMPANIES PROVIDING NEW SERVICES TO MANAGE THEIR ELECTRICITY DEMAND THE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE RESOURCES CAN SUPPORT THE GRIT. WE HAVE ORDERED THE UTILITIES TO MODIFY THEIR CRITICAL PEAK PRICING PROGRAMS WHICH CHARGE A HIGHER PRICE FOR ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION DURING PEAK HOURS ON SELECTED DAYS. AS PART OF THIS WEEK ORDERED SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE CRITICAL PEAK PRICING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE CRITICAL HOURS OF A GRADE EMERGENCY. WE ALSO ORDERED THE MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS TO EXPAND PARTICIPATION INCLUDING TEMPORARILY ALLOWING YEAR ROUND ENROLLMENT IN THE UTILITY INTERRUPTED INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAMS. FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AND LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN ADDITION WE INCREASED DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM ENROLLMENT INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS WE ALSO IMPROVED A NEW STATEWIDE FLEX ALERT PROGRAM TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF CONSERVATION HELP CUSTOMERS UNDERSTAND GREAT CONDITIONS AND INFORM CUSTOMERS OF THE NEED TO CONSERVE WHEN ENERGY DEMAND. IS AT ITS HIGHEST. THE ABOVE IS JUST WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS. THERE IS ALSO AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCES COMING ONLINE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. FROM PRIOR FROM PRIOR CAN A COMMISSION DOES DIRECTIVES WITH TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE MEGAWATTS COMING ONLINE FOR THIS SUMMER. THE COMBINATION OF PRIOR COMMISSION DIRECTIVES AND DIRECTIVES FROM ACTIONS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCES ONLINE THIS SUMMER COMPARED TO LAST WITH IN THIS REPRESENTS A TENFOLD INCREASE. OF THE STORAGE RESOURCES FROM LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME SO THAT IS REALLY TWENTY VERSUS TWO THOUSAND A THOUSAND PLUS FIFTEEN HUNDRED SUMMER RELIABILITY- DECISIONS ALSO INCLUDE THAT TOTAL. SOME OF THESE DECISIONS WE MADE ARE NOT ONES FRANKLY WE CELEBRATE. SOME OF THE INCREMENTAL CAPACITY WE WILL DEPEND ON THE SUMMER ARE NOT CLEAN RESOURCES BUT MOST OF IT IS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE PURSUED THESE PAST FOR THIS SUMMER. DURING LAST AUGUST EXTREME HEAT WAVE WE ALSO CONTENDED WITH COBIT NINETEEN DRY CONDITIONS AND WILDFIRES. AND THOUGH THOSE RISKS ARE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR THEY REMAIN CONSIDERABLE FACTORS AS WE CONTEMPLATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LOSS OF ELECTRICITY TO A COMMUNITY. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ARE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE PROGRESSES FORWARD AND WILL ONLY ACCELERATE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. THE CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED EVENTS OF LAST AUGUST ONLY FURTHER CRYSTALLIZED THE NEED TO BUILD A MORE RELIABLE GRID BY WAY OF ZERO CARBON RESOURCES. THE ORGANIZATIONS HERE HAVE COLLABORATED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IN DEVELOPING THE JOINT AGENCY SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED REPORT THAT ASSESSED VARIOUS PATHWAYS FOR MEETING ARE 1100% CLEAN ENERGY GOAL OUR ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW COLLABORATING I'M CRITICAL PLANNING EFFORTS THAT WILL FACILITATE THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT. AT THE CPUC SPECIFICALLY WE ARE MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE PROCUREMENT AT THE REQUIRED PACE TO MEET THOSE GOALS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES INNOVATIVE DEMAND RESPONSE PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. THE OUTAGES OF LAST AUGUST WERE AN ACCEPTABLE. BUT A SILVER LINING IS IT HAS FURTHERED OUR RESOLVE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO POWER THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IN THE WORLD AND TO LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK MY ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERS FOR THE WORK WE HAVE DONE TOGETHER AND MUST CONTINUE TO DO TOGETHER AND AGAIN THANK YOU OUT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY'S DISCUSSION AND I WILL NOW HAND IT OVER TO. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION CHAIR DAVID HEARTFIELD. HE'S SO MUCH FOR THE BACHELOR AND THANK YOU SURE HOLDEN BUSTER PATTERSON PATTERSON NOT ENOUGH IS A COMMITTEE. ISSUED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU ACCEPT IN OUR DAVID HOPES WILL CHAIR THE ENERGY COMMISSION. ARE IN MANY WAYS I WOULD SAY THAT SUPPORTING ELECTRIC RELIABILITY BECAUSE OUR FIRST SECOND AND THIRD. PRIORITY FOR ALL OF OUR AGENCIES BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU AT THE OUTSET THAT IN THE TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA ENERGY POLICY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN COLLABORATION AS CLOSE AS I'M SEEING IT TODAY BETWEEN THREE AGENCIES- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES- APPETIZER IN PCM OR STAFF FOR REPORT THAT LEADERSHIP I ALSO WANT TO INTRODUCE MY NEWEST CARLY GET THEIR TUITION SO THE CONDUCT OF THE GOVERNOR. APPOINTED TO BE A COMMISSIONER IN MARCH I'VE ASKED COMMISSIONER GOING TO FOCUS. SOLELY ON SUPPORT ELECTRIC LIABILITY BRING HIS CONSIDERABLE MODELING FORECASTING AND INTERAGENCY COORDINATION TALENTS TO BEAR AMERICANS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO- TO ANSWER MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS AS WE GO FORWARD. SO AGAIN THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S LEADING ROLE OUR- FOCUS IS PRIMARILY. ON PERFORMING STATEWIDE PLANNING- WHICH IS THE DEMAND. I ANALYZE DIFFERENT. APPLIANCE INTO TO ZERO. AND WE LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE LAST SUMMER THAT WE NEED TO BUILD UPON OUR PAST NOTICES. AND BUILDS A NEW ANALYTICAL PRODUCTS SO THERE'S MISSION IS DOINGTHIS. BY ENHANCING OUR FORECAST IN A COUPLE WAYS WE'RE EXTENDING THE DEMAND FORECAST TO COVER A FIFTEEN YEAR. HORIZON INSTEAD OF A TEN YEAR HORIZON AND WE'RE USING CLIMATE MODELS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING. OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS- WE'RE EXPANDING OUR COUNTY FORECAST TO SAMMY WIDER RANGE OF WEATHER PATTERNS AS YOU RECALL LAST SUMMER THE- HOTTEST RELIABLY RECORDED TEMPERATURE IN WORLD HISTORY HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA. IN AUGUST. WE'RE ALSO LAUNCHING SOME NEW RELIABILITY ASSESSMENTS ARE RELIED RELIABLE ASSESSMENTS WILL LOOK AT NEAR TERM MID TERM. AND LONG TERM- IN THE NEAR TERM WE'RE ASSESSING SUPPLY DEMAND UNDER DIFFERENT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND WE CONDUCTED THE SUMMER RELIABILITY ASSESSMENTS THIS YEAR. AND WILL BE CONDUCTING SUMMER ASSESSMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR COMING CORD FOR MID TERM WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD FIVE YEARS. AND FOR LONG TERM WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY BUILD OUT AND TRANSMISSION CONFIGURATIONS. FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES WERE EVALUATING THEIR PERFORMANCE BENEFITS AND HOW THEY IMPACT RELIABILITY AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE PC AND CONSOLE. ON PLANS FOR CONTINGENCIES EVERY CASE ANOTHER EXTREME HEAT EVENTS LIKE WE DID LAST SUMMER. WE IDENTIFY ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN CALL ON. AND THEN LEVERAGING THE ENERGY COMMISSION WORK IN SOME OTHER AREAS I THINK YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT ARE EXCITING DIVISION OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS LOOKING. AT SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO EFFICIENCY EVER EXISTING FLEET WE HAVE SEVENTY NINE JURISDICTIONAL THERMAL PLANTS- IN CALIFORNIA IN THE INTERVIEW COMMISSIONS- LEAD TO BE OVERSEE. THERE WERE KERN CURRENTLY REVIEWING AND APPROVING PETITIONS FOR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO ADDITIONAL MEGAWATTS OF INCREMENTAL EFFICIENCY UPGRADES AT SEVEN POWER PLANTS. AND ANOTHER TWENTY THREE HALF MEGAWATTS OF EQUIPMENT UPGRADES FROM BATTERY ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS UP TO EIGHTY NINE MEGAWATTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE BY THE START OF SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THESE ARE. TYPICALLY HOT GAS PATH UPGRADES. AT- THERMAL PLANTS. WE'RE ALSO WE'RE WITH THE P. CARE. OR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RESPONSE. I WAS A GENERAL CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN PUNCHING BELOW OUR WEIGHT OR DEMAND RESPONSE WITH A LOT OF URGENCY TO GET THAT- IMPROVED AND SO WE CONVENE IT ROUND TABLE. WITH ALL THE AGENCIES- WITH THE KEY DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS IN% OUR CONTINUE TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL DEMAND SPONSOR IN THE SHORT TERM. AS WELL AS LONG TERM SO WE HAVE SOME PROGRESS ON THAT THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT FROM MY COLLEAGUE. MISTER ALSO EARLIER% THIS YEAR WE RELEASED OUR DRAFT LOAD MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AIMED AT ENABLING MASS MARKET DEMAND FLEXIBILITY. THROUGH AUTOMATED RESPONSE TO GREAT SIGNALS- AND OUR OUR CROWN JEWEL RESEARCH PROGRAM THE EPIC PROGRAM ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE. HAS NOW PROVIDED SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GRANTS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT DEMAND FLEXIBILITY I WOULD SAY GENERALLY. THE MODEL IS CHANGING FROM YOU KNOW THE OLD VIEW OF SEEING DEMAND IS THIS FIXED THING. TO NOW- WHAT. WE SEE WHAT WE CAN MANIPULATE THAT DEMAND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT MERGING FIELD- AND SO WERE ESTIMATED FROM THAT INVESTMENT THAT TIME OF THE TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS WITH A FLEXIBLE DEMAND CAPACITY. FROM COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AN EIGHTEEN MEGAWATTS FROM IRRIGATION PUMPING LOAD. SHIFT. I WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS SUMMER. ALL OF THIS IS. TO THE WORKER. IN THE DOING. OTHER BUT RELATED AREAS- BEFORE I TURN THE MIKE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE ALAN MINSTER BECAUSE SO. I DID WANT TO JUST RECAP AND SOME OF THE KEY CLEAN ENERGY MILESTONES BECAUSE THIS IS. OF COURSE CLIMATE IS UNDERLYING A LOT OF THE THREATS REFUSING TO BE GREAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING ON CLEANING UP- DIRECTOR GRANT SO LAST YEAR IN CALIFORNIA- WE WERE AT 63% CARBON FREE ELECTRICITY COURSE ON ROUTE 2100% BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE- AND- WE'VE ALSO SEEN. A LOT OF HELP COMING FROM CUSTOMER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEHIND THE METER SO TODAY WE NOW HAVE FORTY THOUSAND BEHIND THE METER ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS DEPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. ADDING FORTY OF THOSE A DAY. WE'RE AT ONE POINT TWO MILLION ROOFTOP SOLAR. ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE STATE TODAY. AND WE'RE ADDING FOUR HUNDRED A DAY- AND THEN ELECTRIC VEHICLES LONG TERM ARE ALSO REALLY AN ASSET. TO THE GRID WERE NEARLY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOCTORS VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN PART IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ADDING SIX HUNDRED FIFTY A DAY. ON AS YOU ALL KNOW LAST YEAR AND I LOOK AT PEOPLE'S BECAME THE NUMBER ONE EXPORT FROM THE STATE CALIFORNIA. I WOULD NOW WANT TO PASS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO GET TO. EIGHT MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND THAT TOGETHER REPRESENTS MORE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND. MEGAWATT HOURS OF STORAGE AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. CONSIDERING THAT 96% OF A VEHICLE'S USEFUL LIFE IS SPENT PART. THAT IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND THESE TWO THINGS. ARE COMING TOGETHER- ENERGY STORAGE. HELLO VEHICLES BE WE'VE BEEN SO IN ACTUALLY TAKING. USED ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES CAR BATTERIES THAT. MAY NOT HAVE THEIR FULL NAME PLATE RATING BUT STILL HAVE A LOT OF USEFUL LIFE AND RE PURPOSING THEM- A STANDALONE- ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS THAT CAN SUPPORT ENERGY STORAGE FOR BUILDING SO. THIS IS WHERE INNOVATION- REALLY CAN CAN SUPPORT OUR LONG TERM NEEDS. I WITH THAT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR DIRECTION AND LEADERSHIP ON BOTH CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS. AND OTHER GREAT RELIABILITY AND ALL PASSED TO MY TO MY COLLEAGUE GOT PRESIDENT ELEMENTARY CASTLE. THANK YOU CHAU SHELLED. OUT GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN FIGHTER PATTERSON. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE WITH YOU TODAY. I'M ALSO JOINED BY THE CASES SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER MARK ROSS LEADER. IT IS YOU MAY RECALL I DURING THE AYE SO SHORTLY AFTER LAST SUMMER'S HEATWAVE THE FACT. IT WAS STILL BEING ACCLIMATED TO THE ISSUES WHEN OCCURRED BRIEFLY BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AST OCTOBER. SINCE THEN I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE I SO AS BEEN UNEQUIVOCALLY FOCUSED ON BEING AS PREPARED AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SUMMER WE'VE TAKEN THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE C. P. C. C. E. C. TO AVOID A REPEAT. OF LAST YEAR'S OUTAGES. I'VE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH PRESIDENT BASHER CHAIR WHO SHOW THEIR TEAMS. THE TIME AND ENERGY WE HAVE SPENT WORKING TOGETHER ON THESE ISSUES HAS ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY THE PRESSURE POINTS THAT MANIFESTED DURING LAST AUGUST'S HEAT WAVE. AND FOCUSED ON THE HIGHEST PRIORITY ACTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE SUMMER. INDEED SHAREHOLDERS HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO STONE HAS BEEN UNTURNED IN SEARCHING FOR RELIABLE OUTCOMES THIS SUMMER. AT THE I SO WE'VE TAKEN MULTIPLE ACTIONS SINCE LAST SUMMER TO ENSURE EFFICIENT MARKET OPERATIONS HI AVAILABILITY OF EXISTING POWER TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY IMPROVED COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION WITH MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND STAKEHOLDERS. THE ACTIONS WE'VE TAKEN INCLUDE CLARIFYING MARKET RULES FOR SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA'S LOADS EXPORTS AND TRANSFERS ACROSS THE ISO GRID. SHE'S ESTABLISHING MINIMUM CHARGING REQUIREMENTS FOR BATTERY STORAGE RESOURCES SO THEY CAN RETURN ENERGY TO THE SYSTEM AFTER SUNSET DURING STRESS GREAT CONDITIONS MAKING SURE THAT OUR MARKETS AND STRONG PRICE SIGNALS FOR IMPORTS AND DEMAND RESPONSE. ENSURING THAT PLAN GENERATOR OUTAGES TO DR GRADE RELIABILITY DURING PERIODS OF PEAK DEMAND IN STREAMLINING THE GRID INTERCONNECTION PROCESS TO EXPEDITE NEW SUPPLY. WE'VE ALSO WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND NEIGHBORING BALANCING AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE COORDINATION AND CLEAR CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED GOING INTO THE SUMMER. FROM THE OPERATORS IN THE CONTROL ROOM FLOOR TRUCK COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT WE HAVE ASSESSED EVERY DIVISION TO FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE TIMELY ADVANCE INFORMATION ABOUT CREATED WEATHER CONDITIONS TO PROMOTE AFFECTED DECISION MAKING AN IMPACTFUL DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS. OUR ANALYTICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN UPDATED WITH LAST YEAR'S WEATHER EVENTS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE FORECAST OF THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE SUMMER WE'VE SEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GENERATION STACK. THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF MANY OVERALL CAPACITY HAS IMPROVED COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY WITH APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THIS TOTAL INCLUDES TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCESCOMING ONLINE IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET TO SERVE OUR NET PEAK DEMAND COMPARED TO THIS TIME LAST YEAR. AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW RESOURCE CAPACITY SOME OF WHICH WILL COME FROM BEHIND THE METER UNDER EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PILOT PROGRAM INITIATED BY THE C. P. C. WE'VE ALSO NOTED THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HANDLING EXTREME TEMPERATURE EVENTS HAS IMPROVED WITH INCREASED MAINTENANCE ON THERMAL GENERATORS THIS PAST WINTER. AND HEALTHY TRANSMISSION CONNECTIONS TO ADJACENT REGIONS WHILE HYDRO CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW AVERAGE THE DIGITAL MEGAWATT SECURED BY THE STATE AGENCIES PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION. THAN LAST YEAR. DOES THAT MEAN THAT WE ARE IN THE CLEAR. NOT NECESSARILY. I HAVE USED THE TERM GUARDED OPTIMISM BECAUSE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THE CPUC NCC CLEARLY PLACE US IN A BETTER POSITION RELATIVE TO LAST SUMMER. HOWEVER THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR GRID RELIABILITY REMAINS EXTREME HEAT. PARTICULARLY HEAT THAT SPREADS ACROSS THE WIDER WESTERN UNITED STATES. ANY CONTINUES TO GET HOTTER EVERY YEAR WE ARE NOTICING EXTREME HEATWAVE EVENTS ARE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE. AS A RESULT THE GREAT WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN VULNERABLE TO HIGHER LOADS DECREASED IMPORTS DURING A BROADER WEST WHY KEEP WAY THAT THAT LIKED WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR. ITS IMPORTS TRY OUT AND WE'RE LIMITED TO CAPACITY THAT'S RIGHT SECURED UNDER RESOURCE ADEQUACY CONTRACTS WERE FACING THE POSSIBILITY OF SCARCITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY THIS SUMMER. FINALLY THE RISK OF WILDFIRES AFFECTING SUPPLY AVAILABILITY. REMAINS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT THREAT. CALIFORNIA'S RELIANCE ON IMPORTS REQUIRES INCREASED COLLABORATION WITH OUR ENERGY NEIGHBORS AND BETTER COORDINATION DURING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS AND IDENTIFY COORDINATED SOLUTIONS SHOULD ANOTHER EVENT OCCUR. THE CASE SO HELD A SUMMER READING THIS LEADERSHIP ROUND TABLE WITH REGIONAL UTILITY EXECUTIVES AND CONDUCTED TABLE TOP EXERCISES WITH UTILITIES AND ADJACENT BALANCING AUTHORITIES. TO WALK THROUGH GRADE SERIOUS AND FIND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT IN OUR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CQC AND OTHERS WERE ALSO RE ESTABLISHING AND EXPANDING THE PAID ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN FOR FLEX ALERTS AND WE WILL AGAIN BE DEPENDING ON CONSUMERS. TO ANSWER THE CALL FOR CONSERVATION. WHEN THE GREATEST MOST IN NEED WE REMAIN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF CONSUMERS ENERGY SAVING ACTIONS FROM LAST SUMMER WHICH PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AVOIDING EXTENDING PERIODS OF ROTATING OUTAGES. WE ALSO INTEND TO HOLD A SOME RECESSED BRIEFING FOR THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE IN A FEW WEEKS. AT THE END OF THE DAY I BELIEVE WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES THE SUMMER COMPARED TO LAST YEAR NEW MARKET. ENHANCEMENTS ADVANCED COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION AND A GREATER. OF OPERATE RISK WILL PROVIDE TREMENDOUS VALUE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HOLDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES WITH YOU TODAY. THIS CONCLUDES OUR OPENING STATEMENTS AND WE ARE ALL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANKS AGAIN. WELL THANK YOU- AND CERTAINLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR THOUGHTFUL OVERVIEW ALL THREE OF YOU. AND HIGHLIGHTING THE- THE CHANGES THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON FROM LAST SUMMER- I JUST WANTED TO ASK A QUICK QUESTION JUST TO GET US STARTED AND I'LL TURN TO ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BUT I'M CURIOUS IF YOU COULD CONTRAST WHAT HAPPENED IN AUGUST VERSUS WHAT HAPPENED IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST. LAST YEAR. IN BOTH INSTANCES AN INTENSE HEAT WAVE BROKE OUT. ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND FLEX ALERT. WERE CALL. YET WE EXPERIENCED ROTATING OUTAGES IN AUGUST BUT AVOIDED THEM IN SEPTEMBER. WHAT WAS DIFFERENT IN SEPTEMBER HEY WE ALREADY APPLIED THE LESSONS LEARNED IN AUGUST AND HOW MIGHT THAT INFORMERS AND OUR RESPONSE THE SUMMER. IT FOR ANYONE OF YOU BUT- SO WHAT BY ALL MEANS. CEMEX ARE YES I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE INITIAL. ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK SO I THINK THERE WERE THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LESSONS LEARNED ON THE VERY FIRST WEEKEND IN AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH VERY QUICKLY. I THINK IT THE I SO WE IDENTIFIED THE SENATE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH WITH SCHEDULING POWER AND OUR ABILITY TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE PHYSICAL SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCE WISE THAT WE QUICKLY RECTIFIED SO THAT WAS ADDRESSED TO AYE WITHIN EVEN THE FIRST WEEKEND THE SECOND THING I THINK REALLY THE BIG DIFFERENCE MAKER. AS KEY AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO BE VERY VERY HOT ACROSS THE BOUNCER BOX IN THE WEEKEND WAS THAT THERE WAS JUST A SIGNIFICANT MOBILIZATION OF COMMUNITY COMMUNICATION COORDINATION AND ON THE AND THAT SIGNIFICANT DEMAND RESPONSE EFFORT I MEAN THE EFFORTS THAT INDUSTRY AND CONSUMERS MADE CALPERS CONSERVE POWER ACROSS. OR SO I THINK IT WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON BOTH THE GENERATION AND THE DEMAND SOCCER MADE AVAILABLE IN THE STATE WAS ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND PREVENT ADDITIONAL ROTATING OUT IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO DO OUT FOR THIS UPCOMING SUMMER IS TO SORT OF SYSTEM THAT TIES A LOT OF THOSE EFFORTS THAT WERE DONE ON A BIT MORE OF AN AD HOC BASIS. LAST SUMMER MUCH GREATER COORDINATED CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR BOTH SUPPLY RESOURCES AND DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES AND ANOTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO BE I THINK VERY DIFFERENT THIS SUMMER THAT WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF LAST SUMMER IS THAT OUR COMMUNICATION IN ADVANCE WARNING SYSTEMS ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE I SO WILL BE PROVIDING SEVEN DAYS OF ADVANCE WARNING FOR TEMPERATURE EXCURSIONS AND HEATING ADVANCED REGARDING REAL TIME UPDATES. ON GREAT CONDITIONS GETTING THAT INFORMATION WIDELY DISSEMINATED TO THE UTILITY UTILITY COMMUNITY AND THE OPERATING COMMUNITY AND THE FLEX ALERT PROGRAM I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE A SET OF VERY DISTINCT AND VERY ACTIONABLE MESSAGES THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS. SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO BE PART OF THE RELIABILITY EQUATION IF WE DO INDEED RUN INTO STRESS GREAT CONDITION SO IT TAKES BOTH A HEALTHY SUPPLY STAR WHICH THE CPC ENERGY COMMISSION OF HEALTH INCREASE FOR THE SUMMER AND A REALLY STRONG AND COORDINATED DEMAND RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY ACTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS SUMMER RESULT. IN DIFFERENT OUTCOMES THAN LAST SUMMER. SHAREHOLDERS I'LL ADD TO THAT. IN HI I DO- WANT TO THAT I APOLOGIZE LITTLE BIT. EARLY IT BECAUSE HE WASN'T EVEN IN THE CHAIR WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER- HEAT STORMS. AND RELATED FIRE- SITUATIONS SO. IT IS THOSE VERY THINGS THAT LEN ENUMERATED JUST NOW I THINK THAT IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- THAT WE DID YOU USE THE WORD COMMUNICATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WAS EXTREMELY INSTRUMENTAL. IN HELPING US COORDINATE. AND HELPING ALL OF US IN TERMS OF THE DEMAND RESPONSE- INITIATIONS AND PROGRAMS- AND I IT TRULY MADE THE DIFFERENCE- HAVING SAID THAT. THEY THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE HAD TO DO. THAT NONE OF US WANTS TO DO AGAIN- THERE WERE IN PART THANKS TO. CHAIR HI SHIELDS WHO. PERSONALLY CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF NAVY. AND GOT THE SHIPS OUT IN THE SAN DIEGO HARBOR TO. MOVE OFFSHORE ENERGY AND MOVE ON TO. THEIR THEIR DIESEL- THERE WAS A LOT OF THAT THAT WE ALL HAD TO CALL UPON- IN TERMS OF. RESOURCES THAT WE TYPICALLY WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE ENGAGE BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION. AND BECAUSE OF THE HARM TO ON. OUR GREENHOUSE GAS GOALS- SO IT WAS THAT MOBILIZATION. EFFORT THAT- WE REALLY- I HAVE SAID TO MY COLLEAGUES WE ARE ALL IN THE FOXHOLE TOGETHER. AND WE WENT TO BATTLE AND WE DID IT AT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AND IT TOOK A LOT OF HARD WORK FROM OUR THREE AGENCIES AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO- L. IT DID A VERY. GOOD JOB- AS SHE WHAT WE HAD TO DO AND WHAT THOSE THINGS LET US TO START FOCUSING ON FOR THE SUMMER. I'VE YEAH I'LL JUST ADD ALSO JUST FOR THIS SUMMER JUST A COUPLE OTHER PIECES OF ELABORATION IF I MAY HAVE TRAVELED AND IS YOU KNOW THE CAPACITY ADDITIONS THAT HAVE MADE THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP FOR THE SUMMER- PARTICULARLY THE BATTERIES IN THE ENERGY STORAGE RESOURCES WERE PERHAPS HOSTED TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY SPRUCE EXPLICITLY DESIGNED. RIGHT ONTO THE GRID TO ADDRESS THAT. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE RAN INTO LAST SUMMER OF. STRESSED WHY FOLLOWING SUNSET YOU KNOW WE ARE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW OUR RENEWABLE RESOURCE FLEET BEHAVES BEHAVED EXACTLY AS EXPECTED AND WE AS WE'VE KNOWN AS WE'RE MOVING TOWARD A SYSTEM THAT RELIES MORE ON VARIABLE RESOURCES LIKE WITH IT SO THAT WE NEED TO COMPLEMENT THAT. WITH OTHER RESOURCES SO FORTUNATE THIS SUMMER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MUCH EXPANDED ENERGY STORAGE FLEET WHICH WILL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN HELPING ABSORB EXCESS ENERGY DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY IN AND FEEDING THAT BACK INTO THE GRID AFTER SUNSET TO HELP. SUPPORT RELIABILITY SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE- THIS SUMMER RELATIVE TO LAST YEAR AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THAT- SURE HARSH OUT OF MENTIONED IN HIS PRESENTATION THAT. WE'RE- FIGHTING THE LOWER WEIGHT I THINK OR SOMETHING TO THAT EXTENT- AS IT RELATES TO A DEMAND RESPONSE I WANTED TO GET SOME SENSE OF HOW YOU'RE- ALL SEEN THAT. HE'S COMING TOGETHER BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST AS WE GO INTO- THE SUMMER MONTHS. YEAH WELL I AM BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT DIG INTO THE CODE NINETEENTH SO- BUT I WOULD SAY ME. WITH TO DEMAND- DEMERITS ONCE WE HAVE BEEN PUNCHING BELOW. BUT IT'S BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS FOR US IN TERMS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS WE FUNDED- THAT WAS LIKE ON CONNECT WHICH IS DOING A MASSIVE PROGRAM THIS SUMMER TO REACH OUT TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS AND GET PEOPLE THE NON PROGRAMMABLE THERMOSTATS LIKE NEST UNDER THE PROGRAM NOW- AND ACTUALLY MAYBE LA YOU COULD SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DEMAND RESPONSE EXPERIMENT FOR THE SUMMER. I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S HELPFUL I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR US TO STATE I THINK CRIME I THINK. FOR BOTH THE CBCP CCMA IN THE GOVERNOR SO YOU KNOW IT WITH IN OUR IN OUR FINAL ROUTE CAUSE ANALYSIS. WE PUT OUT RESOURCE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION ACROSS THE WIDE SPECTRUM OF RESOURCES AND WE IDENTIFIED SOME ISSUES IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PATCHES WITH. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RESOURCES RELATIVE TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY EXPECTATIONS WE DID NOTE. TO CERTAIN AGREES THAT IN SOME CASES WE SAW SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES. THAT INSTIGATED A I THINK A VERY VERY ROBUST CONVERSATION WITH THE DEMAND RESPONSE COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK WE ALL LEAD INTO AND LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY WHERE WE'RE WE LOOK AT THE DATA. AND WE TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RESOURCE CAPABILITIES AND THE ACTUAL RULES FOR THE DEBATERS FUNDS PROGRAMS AND SODA COULD BE MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT- WITHIN THE THREE STE AT ENTITIES. TO LEAN IN AND TO LOOK FOR SOME ADDITIONAL WAYS WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. TO BETTER ENABLE THOSE RESOURCES TO MEET THEIR PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES THAT I THINK THIS SMMER WILL BE PARTICULARLY TRUE. WITH RESPECT TO THE THIRD PARTY RESOURCES AT THE AYE SO WE'VE MADE SOME CHANGES TO OUR BASE LINING METHODOLOGY WHICH SORT OF ESTABLISH A DEMONIC IT'S WHICH THEIR PERFORMANCE IS MEASURED. THE HOPE IS TO SEE IF THAT OPENS UP SOME ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY. THE CPC'S EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO REALLY CARRY OUT. CAPABILITY WITH STRONG PRICE SIGNALS- TO ACCESS THAT CAPABILITY. AND THEN OF COURSE THE FLEX ROUTE COMPLEX ALERT PROGRAM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID USE LAST YEAR IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN TERMS OF ITS BEST MESSAGING. VISIBILITY IN IN THE CLARITY OF WHAT WILL BE ASKING AND ENCOURAGING OF CONSUMERS SO ALL THREE OF THOSE LEGS THE THIRD PARTY. PERFORMANCE THE BIG E. L. R. P. PROGRAM. IN THE FLEX ALERT SHOULD WORK IN TANDEM TO HOPEFULLY GET EVEN GREATER DEMAND RESPONSE FROM SOCCER BLASTER AND WILL COME OUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SUMMER. CONSOLIDATE MESSAGES TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS TOGETHER. I WITH THE D. OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS YOUR CAROLINE JUST FOR THE ARE TO GET COUPLE THINGS. THAT- I COLLEAGUE HAVE ARE ALLUDE TO AND I MENTIONED IN MY OPEN REMARKS AS- AS ELLIE IT- JUST SPOKE ABOUT THE EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT C. E. L. R. P. PILOT. AND THAT CAME OUT IN THE DECISIONS THAT WE PUT FORTH IN MARCH. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ALLOW PG&amp;E AND SCE EDISON. AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. AND I SAID TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS IN THE ELECTRIC USE DURING TIMES OF HIGH DEMAND. WHEN THERE WILL BE LIMITED GENERATION TO MEET THAT DEMAND. AND AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT EMERGENCY PROGRAM- AND IT'S REALLY. DESIGNED TO BE A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. DEPLOYED THE WHEN THE GREAT. AS AT THE EDGE AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING ITS EMERGENCY AND IT'S PERHAPS ONE TOOL THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL FOR US BUT ONE WE- WE HOPE WE NEVER GET THAT CLOSE- ALSO AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS WE HAVE MODIFIED THE I. O. U.'S CRITICAL PEAK PRICING PROGRAMS. THE C. B. P. IS A RETAIL RATE WHEREBY THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES CHARGE. HIGHER PRICES OF FOR ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION DURING THE PEAK HOURS. OF THE SELECTED DAYS- FOR THAT PROGRAM WE HAVE SHIFTED THE CPP. A WINDOW TO THE HOURS OF FOUR PM TO NINE PM THAT P. CONNECT PEAK. TO BETTER ALIGN WITH THE GRID NAMES. INCREASE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CPP EVENTS ALLOWED PER YEAR. AND ARE PROVIDING CUSTOMER EDUCATION WITH A FOCUS ON IMPROVING. THE PARTICIPATION AND THEN. ALSO HAVE MY- SOME OF OUR EXISTING DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS FOR THE YEARS OF TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO THROUGH A HOST OF CHANGES INTENDED TO EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY AND INCREASE INCENTIVES- THESE INCLUDE. THE I'LL USE BASE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM WHICH WE CALL THE FIFTH THE I. P. AND THE CAPACITY BUILDING PROGRAM. SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL TERRACE AND GRANDJEAN- S. C. EDISON. THE PROPOSAL TO CREATE A SECOND PHASE OF THE VIRTUAL POWER PLANT PILOT TO TEST DISPATCHABLE TECHNOLOGIES DURING GRID RELIABILITY OF THIS INCLUDING. D. E. L. R. P. WHICH I JUST TO MAKE MENTION AND THEN L. IT WILL SPOKE ABOUT THE- FINDING A NEW STATEWIDE FLEX ALERT PAID MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH A FOCUS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND DIGITAL MEDIA AND I WOULD ADD THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS NAME REVISED ADDITIONAL MONIES. FOR THE FLEX ALERT ON CAMPAIGN SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST YOUR SOME OF THE DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS THAT ON THE CPUC HAS- EITHER STARTED OR- MODIFIED IN LITERALLY TWO DECISION ONE DECISION IN AND- JANUARY- SKEWS ME THAT RIGHT AND ONE IN MARCH. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ELLIOTT AND DAVID FOR YOUR RUN REMARKS AND DEMAND RESPONSE AS WELL. THANK YOU I DO APPRECIATE THE EVEN THE COLLABORATION ON ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE ALL WORKING IN HARMONY I APPRECIATE THAT. AND TO SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE TO ALL WHO ARE WATCHING THIS. HEARING JUST HOW- NOT ONLY COLLABORATIVE YOU'VE BEEN BUT HOW YOU ARE ALSO GOING OUT IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE DETAILED ISSUES GRANT EARLY. THAT REQUIRE THAT KIND OF ATTENTION SO THEY WERE IN A STRONGER POSITION GOING INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS APPRECIATE THAT I'M GONNA PAUSE ON MY QUESTIONS I'M GONNA TURN TO DR QUIRK AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO MAY HAVE. QUESTIONS ASK. OUR THANK YOU ALL FOR RIDE BE RESPONSIVE TO US REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ALL BEING HERE. SO YES I'M BILL CORK AND I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A PROBLEM THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO RUN OUT OF ENERGY IN THE WINTER. WHEN WE'RE GONE TO RENEWABLES WHICH'LL PRIDE DOMINANTLY BI SOLAR- CALIFORNIA WIND ACTUALLY GOES TO THE OFFSHORE WIND GOES DOWN DURING THE WINTER- SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF. ENERGY GENERATION DURING THE WINTER I BROUGHT THIS UP WITH THE CLIFF OF COMMISSIONER OF CPUC COMMISSIONER CLIFF RUSSIA OFTEN. AND WHAT DO WE DO- FOR THE WINTER- MONTHS AS WE APPROACH A HUNDRED PERCENT- PEOPLE HAVE VARIOUS IDEAS YOU CAN'T DO IT WITH BATTERIES THEY WON'T HOLD A CHARGE LONG ENOUGH AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LITHIUM AND COBALT ANYWAY. BOB YOU CAN'T DO IT WITH- PUMPED STORAGE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH. SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CREATING HYDROGEN FROM SOLAR AND STORING IT. WHATEVER WE DO WHEN YOU STORE SOMETHING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IT'S LIKE PUTTING MONEY IN THE GROUND- IT'S GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE. THAT MUCH- PROJECT- BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT'S BEING DONE NOW TO LOOK AHEAD. TO THAT ISSUE OF RELIABILITY FOR THE WINTER MONTHS AS WE GET CLOSER CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT A BIT- SO. FOR ONE THING- WHAT ONE OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS AT THIS POINT FUNDED ABOUT SIXTY ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. WITH VIRTUALLY EVERY CHEMISTRY MENTIONED LITHIUM ION WHICH IS THE PREDOMINANT FORMA STORES TODAY AND CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THE LEADER IN THE SPACE BUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF OTHER CHEMISTRIES VANADIUM IRON CHROMIUM AND OTHERS WE JUST FIND IT COMICAL FORM ENERGY. WHICH HAS A VERY VERY VERY LOW COST BUT VERY INEFFICIENT ROUNDTRIP EFFICIENCY SO LOOK AT MY OWN IS ABOUT 90% ROUGHLY ROUND TRIP EFFICIENCY THIS CHEMISTRIES ABOUT 50% CONTRA PROFICIENCY BUT IT'S SUPER CHEAP- AND THERE IS A CHANCE WHAT WE HAVE SURPLUS RENEWABLES AND SURPLUS SOLAR DURING THE DAY. ARE TO ACTUALLY CHARGE WHEN YOU HAVE EXTRA ENERGY AND USE IT FOR A SEASONAL STORAGE SO THAT IS A AN EMERGING FIELD THAT I DO SEE GROWING- IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT ALL OF THE POWER TO BE SOLD FOR EXAMPLE WE WANT TO DIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING WIND INCLUDING OFFSHORE WIND WOULD FOR PUTTING A LOT OF WORK INTO RIGHT NOW. INCLUDING GEOTHERMAL AND OTHERS AND SO DIVERSITY OF RENEWABLE GENERATION IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STRATEGY AUGMENTED BEEFING UP STORAGE GENERALLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S- BUDGET- IN REVISE IS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO JUST DO LONG DURATION STORAGE SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR. FOCUS FOR US- IN THE YEARS AHEAD. I'LL JUST ADD TO IF I MAY UM. SENATOR THAT AT THE SEAT U. C. WE I AGREE SO. WITH THE SAN- IDEAS. THE CHAIR JUST PUT FORWARD AND THAT IS A DIVERSITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO OR THE PORTFOLIO IS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND WE HAVE THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS THAT DOES DICTATE INDEED- A THREE YEAR FORWARD LOOKING- PROCESS THAT THEN LEADS TO- BORDERS OF A PROCUREMENT THAT WE AT THE CPUC- PUT FORWARD SO- THE DIVERSITY OF THE PORTFOLIO IS REALLY CRITICAL AS AT THE CHAIRMAN SAID WE DON'T JUST WANT TO SURVIVE ON SOLAR AND SOLAR. BACKED UP BATTERY AS WELL BUT- WE'RE ENCOURAGING IN OUR I. R. P. PROCESS AND DECISION WHICH WILL BE FORTHCOMING IN THE NEXT MONTH THE CURRENT ONE THAT WILL COVER TWENTY TWENTY THREE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY SIX. A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO SO I'M GONNA TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE EDWARD RANDOLPH TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT I MISSED THAT YOU LIKE TO ADD OR THAT WOULD ADD ON TO WHAT- CHAIR PUNCTUAL JUST SENT HER- THANK YOU PRESENT A BACHELOR AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY COVER IT I'LL JUST ADD. ON IF YOU LOOK AT THE MODELING FOR THAT ARE DONE WITH AN I. R. P. COMPARE THAT WITH MODELING HAVE BEEN DONE- WITH THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT- MODELING THAT'S BEING DONE AT A RP IN RELATION TO- SCOPING PLANS BUT THEN ALSO VERY IMPORTANTLY MODELING HAVE BEEN DONE BY- VARIOUS ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS. OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE THEY'RE CONSISTENTLY SHOWING- THE ROAD MAP TO GET TO THAT NINETY PERCENT- CARBON FREE- IS COST OF. COST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO GET THERE AS LONG AS WE PURSUE A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THAT INCLUDES- A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT CAN OPERATE IN DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY- GETTING TO THAT NEXT TEN PERCENT- MAY BE MORE OF A CHALLENGE BUT- YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY THINK LET'S GET TO THE NINETY PERCENT- AND THEN KEEP PUSHING THROUGH THERE. BUT THERE ARE NOW ALSO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MODELING EFFORTS IT CHAU- THE RESOURCE DIVERSITY MIXES WE CAN FOLLOW TO GET TO THAT- 100% THAT ARE OUT THERE AND YES R. I. R. P. PRECEDING WILL HAVE SOME DECISIONS COMING OUT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- THERE'S BEEN SOME JUDGES RULINGS OUT THERE THAT YOU KNOW INDICATING NEED FOR- SOME BILLS OUT VERY SOON OF GEO THERMAL- OF THAT LONG DURATION STORAGE- THAT STORAGE CAN HELP BOTH COVER YOU- FOR MULTIPLE HOURS BETWEEN THE DAY AND THE NIGHT BUT THEN ALSO- THE SEASONAL STORAGE OUT THERE- AND- YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE A DECISION OUT THERE THE BILL'S ON. ON THE JUDGE'S COMMENTS PLUS COMMENTS WE'VE HEARD- FROM STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT PROCEEDING. I THANK YOU. FOR I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SOMEONE ELSE FIRST IF I COULD YEAH BUT WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU APPRECIATE THAT- SO MEMBER OF ARCADIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH US IT'S OBVIOUSLY AS PRESIDENT BETTER POINTS OUT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT. THE POWER STAYS ON FOR CALIFORNIANS SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION AND CLEARLY THEY DIDN'T DEDICATION. THAT IS EVIDENT IN THE WORK YOU'VE DONE TO DATE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE IN A BETTER PLACE THIS SUMMER. REALLY GRATEFUL TO HEAR US TALKING ABOUT INCREASED ENERGY STORAGE I THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL TO OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO AND I THINK THAT THAT. IT OFTEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY OH THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO CONTINUE. TO INCREASE NATURAL GAS AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS REALLY THE HEART OF WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO WHICH IS STORE CLEAN ENERGY TO ENSURE IT'S AVAILABLE DURING THAT PEAK DEMAND. AND SO I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT DEMAND RESPONSE I WANT TO TOUCH ON AND THE THIRD ROUTE BECAUSE THE YOU ALL IDENTIFIED- WHICH WAS THAT SOME PRACTICES IN THE DAY AHEAD ENERGY MARKET EXACERBATED THE SUPPLY CHALLENGES UNDER HIGHLY STRESSED CONDITIONS AS I READ THAT THAT'S A FANCY WAY OF SAYING THAT WE WERE EXPORTING ENERGY ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH WHEN WE NEEDED IT SO BADLY- RATHER THAN USING THE ENERGY BEING CREATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I KNOW YOU THEN SUSPENDED CONVERGENCE BIDDING WHICH WE SAW ON THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED THAT THAT ALLOWED US TO EXPORT LESS ENERGY BUT ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY EXPORTING ENERGY AND THAT IS A MAJOR REASON WHY WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO MEET HELP TO ME CALIFORNIA'S DEMANDS THAT DAY. AND I JUST WANT TO EXPAND ON WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ADDRESS THAT I KNOW YOU PUT THAT CONVERGENCE MEETINGS BACK THAT SEEM TO BE WHAT ADDRESSED IN THE SHORT TERM BUT IT APPEARS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO OTHER THINGS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT IN THE POSITION TO BE EXPORTING ENERGY AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE HEAT EVENTS THIS SUMMER. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I'LL- TRY TO ADDRESS IT IS DIRECTLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED. NUMEROUS TIMES. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE- JUST WHERE IS TRANSPARENT AND AS CLEAR AS WE POSSIBLY COULD ABOUT ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT ON A DAY AHEAD BASIS. ARE GOING INTO THE AUGUST FOURTEENTH FIFTEENTH TIME FRAME. OF THE ISO DID. INDICATE THAT HE COULD SUPPORT GREATER EXPORTS I IN A DAY AHEAD MARKET. MIND YOU WE WERE STILL ANTICIPATING BEING A SIGNIFICANT NET IMPORTER BUT AT DURING THAT DURING THAT TIME FRAME BUT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH BECAUSE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW ENTITIES THAT WERE ATTEMPTING TO BUY OUT OF OUR MARKET. AS IS COMMON. IN THE COMBINATION WITH THE CONVERGENCE BETTING THAT WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT MORE EXPORTS ONCE WE SAW THAT. WE WERE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PURCHASE BACK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT ENERGY IN THE SUBSEQUENT DAY HOURLY AND REAL TIME MARKET SO WE'VE MADE THAT DIFFERENCE OUT BETWEEN DAY AHEAD AND ARE REALLY REAL TIME SUCH THAT BY THE TIME WE ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE HOURS DISPATCH. ON THE FOURTEENTH FIFTEENTH WE WORDS. IMPORTING I THINK APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY WE WERE STILL BY FAR AND AWAY THE NET IMPORTER IN THE MOST OF THAT IMBALANCE HAD BEEN RECTIFIED. THAT SAID WE CLEARLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT GOING FORWARD WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIDUAL UNIT COMMITMENT PROCESS MADE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE MOST ACCURATE SCHEDULING BEHAVIOR WE POSSIBLY COULD. AND MADE SURE THAT IF WE THAT IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE MERGING OF OUR PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL MARKET MECHANISMS THAT WE HAD CLARIFIED AS WE ARE ABLE TO CLEAR THEM UP VERY QUICKLY. IN ADDITION TO SINCE LAST AUGUST- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK. I WISH WITH. EIGHT AND BECAUSE ACROSS. THE TO ME SURE THAT THE SCHEDULING PRIORITIES FOR LOAD SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA FOR EXPORTS OUT OF OUR MARKET. ENTRY OTHER ENTITIES WHO WIELD POWER ACROSS OUR SYSTEM ARE CLARIFIED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE SO WE WERE VERY TRANSPARENT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION- THAT THAT WAS A- FACTOR THE CONSTRUCTING TRIBUTE TO THE STRESS THE- PRECONDITIONS. YOU KNOW WE HAD THOSE MARKET MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR MANY MANY YEARS WORK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT A PROBLEM UNTIL WE GOT TO THE OUTER EDGE OF OUR RESERVE MARGIN AND SO THE OTHER VARIABLES COMPETITION REALLY CREATE THE PROBLEM SO IT CERTAINLY BY ITSELF. I WAS NOT GOING TO GET WAS NOT GONNA SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM WE SAW EVEN GREATER. LOAD FORECASTS IN SUBSEQUENT DAYS IF IT WASN'T FOR THE MOBILIZATION- THAT YOUR WHOLE SHIELD AND PRESIDENT PATRICK TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. WE WOULD HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL ROTATING OUTAGES EVEN WITH THOSE FIXES TO THE MARKET SO I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO OWN IT AND THAT THEIR ISSUES BUT IT WAS FIVE. CERTAINLY NOT- THE LONE VARIABLE- THAT CONTRIBUTED THE OUTAGES AND ALL THE OTHER CHANGES THAT WE'RE MAKING. IN INCOME IN COORDINATION WITH THE STATE AGENCIES ARE ESSENTIAL. FOR RELIABILITY GOING TOWARDS UP THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I AND I HOPE THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO. THANK YOU AB ALSO TO ADDRESS. AND THE I'M SURE ALL OF YOU SIDE BUT THERE WAS A MARCH THIRTY FIRST ARTICLE BIG KQED CAME OUT WITH THIS GUY SAYING THAT- SHUT DOWN RATHER THAN TURN UP OF THE PENDERS FACILITY BY A PG&amp;E 8EDULING. COORDINATOR I GUESS THE QUESTIONS WERE RAISED IN THAT ARTICLE ABOUT WHETHER THAT WAS AS- INDICATED ACCIDENTAL WHETHER THEIR INCENTIVES IN PLACE TO INCENTIVIZE AND I OWE YOU THAT ALSO CONTROLS ACCESS TO ENERGY DURING. A SHORTAGE. AS WE SEE POWER THE COST OF ENERGY GOING UP. SURE AS IT IS IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER THAT WAS INTENTIONAL OR NOT OR WHETHER THERE IS INCENTIVE OR NOT TO DO THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE SAW. YOU GUYS SO PUT OUT A REQUEST TO P. GINNY THE SCHEDULING COORDINATOR THEN REACTED THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU HAD INSTRUCTED AND I'M SEVEN BORN STEEN AS HE MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE SAID YOU KNOW ARE WE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNICATIONS ARE CLEAR IN THE WITH THE ISO IS AFTER CALLOUS OF ASKING FOR IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE EVENTS. SO THEY WERE NOT EVEN THOUGH WHETHER THAT WAS THE FINAL TIPPING POINT AS INDICATED OR JUST ONE OF SOUND LIKE A LOT OF FACTORS WE NEED TO BE GETTING IT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ENSURING CLEAR COMMUNICATION OF OUR ENERGY GREAT THINGS LIKE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR SO I WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED YEAH VERY MUCH SO NO GOOD AT THE TWO THOUSAND. YOUR QUESTION AND YOU KNOW AGAIN- THIS IS ANOTHER ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW IN IN OUR EVALUATION OF ALL THE EVENTS OF AUGUST FOURTEENTH THE FIFTEENTH WE WENT BACK AND WE LOOKED VERY CAREFULLY AT THE DATA. WE LOOKED WE LISTENED TO ALL THE COURT REVIEWED ALL THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN OURSELVES AND PG&amp;E AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW I'M SURE THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DISPATCH ORDERS DELIVERED DURING THOSE PERIODS THIS WAS ONE WHERE THIS THERE WAS A COMMUNICATION MIX UP- WITH THE PLANT OPERATOR. IN THE UTILITY AND I KNOW TO THEIR CREDIT P. JEANNIE ACTUALLY SPOKE PUBLICLY AND OPENLY IN IN- IN THIS. LAST YEAR AND- WE CERTAINLY DO NOT SEE AN AND SO. FOR THEM WHAT'S TO BE. GENERATION IN EVEN MORE PRO NINETY. CLEAN PORTLY. THE DEPARTMENT OF MARKET MONITORING OUR INDEPENDENT MARKET MONITOR. I HAD ACCESS TO JUST. REBEL AMOUNTS OF DATA WENT BACK AND REVIEWED EVERYTHING AND FOUND ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE OF WITHHOLD STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING OR MARKET MANIPULATION DURING THIS PERIOD SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S- IMPORTANT ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ENERGY MARKETS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN YOUR SECTOR EVENING. VERY VIGILANT AND DILIGENT BUT CERTAINLY IT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE COMMUNICATION EXCEPT. I WAS CERTAINLY BY FAR AND AWAY NOT THIS WEEK THE SWING ISSUE THAT THAT WITH THE CITY BUT THE STATE AND THE DISTRUSTING DITIONS THE HEAT. AND THE LOADS AND ALL THE OTHER VARIABLES ARE MUCH MUCH MUCH BIGGER. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS- AND I THINK THAT THAT ISSUE HAS BEEN RECTIFIED. AND GOING FORWARD WE CERTAINLY WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OURSELVES AND CERTAINLY THE UTILITIES IN THERE TOO AND THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE BECAUSE CLEAR AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE CAN YOU SAY HOW. IT'S BEEN RECTIFIED. YEAH I MEAN. JEFF WELL FIRST OF ALL- A COUPLE THINGS. LAST SEVERAL WEEKS- IN ADDITION TO HOSTING. THE READING THIS ROUND TABLE WITH LEADERS FROM EIGHTEEN UTILITIES AND ASSET OWNERS AROUND THE WEST REVIEWING ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. OUR SYSTEM OPERATORS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING TABLE TOP EXERCISES WITH THE UTILITIES. AND ALL OF THE ADJACENT SYSTEM OPERATORS TO GO RIGHT THROUGH. THE SET OF OPERATING SCENARIOS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS PLAYBOOKS. THAT GOVERN COMMUNICATIONS AND DISPATCH BETWEEN THE SYSTEM OPERATORS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER POTENTIAL MISTAKES THAT WERE. THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S OUR PARTICULAR SITUATION WAS. ABSOLUTELY THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE I THINK THE VAST VAST VAST MAJORITY OF DISPATCHES A COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN OURSELVES AND UTILITIES AND UTILITIES THEY'RE- IN THE SCHEDULING COORDINATORS ARE ASSETS WORKS JUST FINE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE HAD THAT ONE INCIDENT- AND I BELIEVE IT'S BEEN RECTIFIED AND WE'LL. WE'LL KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU I HAVE ONE LAW QUESTION. IT ONLINE. THANK YOU AND THIS ONE'S FOR PRESIDENT ROGER. AND WE'VE MENTIONED A LOT THE VALUE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR IN BEHIND THE METER RESOURCES ADAM I THINK- YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL OF YOU AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT ONE OF THE THINGS. AND THAT IS YOU MAY KNOW I'M WORKING ON AND I KNOW THAT THEIR PCS SAID THEY'RE WORKING ON IS NOT ONLY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE BEHIND THE METER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE FOR DEMAND RESPONSE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL. BUT ALSO SO WE CAN DEPLOY THAT ENERGY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE HAD ENOUGH ENERGY BEHIND THE METER. TO AVOID THESE- ROLLING BACK OUT SO I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE P. YOU SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT. BEHIND THE METER ENERGY IS MORE MEANINGFUL IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBER ON. THE BEHIND THE METER RESOURCES ISSUES SAID I HAVE. PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN ON OUR CLEAN ENERGY- AND RELIABILITY OBVIOUSLY OF THE OF THE GRID. AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS- AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMERS WHO WANT INSTALLED BEHINDTHE METER SOLAR. STORAGE LIKE THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND THE NET. ENERGY METERING PROGRAM- SOME BEHIND THE METER STORAGE SYSTEMS ARE SIZED TO HAVE EXCESS ENERGY THAT COULD BE EXPORTED TO THE GRID. HOWEVER WHEN THEY- WERE INTERCONNECTED TO THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM THE CUSTOMERS DID NOT ALWAYS ELECT TO HAVE THE- I. O. U.'S NOT COMPLETE- A DISTRIBUTION IMPACTS STUDY WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY YOU KNOW. AS A NECESSITY OR HAVE THE AYE SO COMPLETE A DELIVER ABILITY STUDY SO THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR CONCENTRATION AND- DEVOTION TO- TO THE DIFFERENT BEHIND THE METER PROGRAMS I'M GONNA ASK. MY COLLEAGUE AND RANDOLPH TO ADD ANY OF THE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE RAISED MEMBER- AND ANSWERS TO SOME OF THEM- AGAIN THANK YOU PRESIDENT BADGER ON THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD ON TO THAT IS. WHAT WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IS THE EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM- AND THAT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL TO IT ALLOWS- VARIOUS- ENTITIES TO. OUR BED IN OUR TOP FOR- EITHER DEMAND RESPONSE RESOURCES OUR GENERATION RESOURCES- TO THE ICE SO TO THE AYE- TO THE GRIT- IN THE EVENT A OF WORK IS CALLED. ONE OF THE- RESOURCES IS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EMERGENCY LEVEL REDUCTION PROGRAM THAT WE HOPE THEY DO PARTICIPATE AND- IT IS- WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE AND REFERRED TO AS NET EXPORT OF BEHIND THE METER STORAGE AND ALLOWING- BEHIND THE METER STORAGE THAT IS INTERCONNECTED TO THE GREAT IN A WAY WHERE THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ALREADY NET EXPORT- TWO BILLION TO THE- ERP AND PARTICIPATE THERE- THAT SET UP AS A PILOT PROJECT SO THAT WE CA- GET GREATER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT THE CAPABILITIES OF THOSE RESOURCES ARE ON IN BETTER DESIGNING MARKET RULES- MORE OTHER RULES AROUND THOSE PROGRAMS IN FUTURE YEARS SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING COMPENSATED FOR THE VALUE TO PROVIDING- BUT AT THE SAME TIME- THEY'RE. PROVIDING THE VALUE THEY'RE GETTING COMPENSATED FOR. THANK YOU I FOR THAT I. THE WORK THAT DOING HOPEFULLY CAN MOVE THAT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THIS IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR CALIFORNIA. DURING THE INTERESTS YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE SUMMER OUTAGES- DURING THIS HEAT WAVE MOST ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE DURING THE PANDEMIC TO STAY HOME SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO HAPPEN THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREATER. DEMAND AT THAT TIME. IT ALSO IS A STARK REMINDER OF HOW MUCH WE RELY ON THE GRID IN OUR THAT DAILY LIVES. I THINK THAT GIVEN OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE USE THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEM HERE. AND ALSO CONSIDERING OUR EXISTING NEEDED TO MAKE THE GRID MORE RELIABLE IT SEEMS THAT WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING RESOURCES. TO OFFSET DEMAND AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE CLEANEST OPTIONS AVAILABLE. HI MIKE MY QUESTION TO- PRESIDENT DOWNTURN. AGAIN THE BRITS RELIABILITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE DO HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THESE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ME IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. AND SO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED SPECIFICALLY AS WE TRY TO MEET OUR TRANSPORTATION GOALS. IT THIS IS ENORMOUS SO THE QUESTION IS HOW IS THE ELECTRIFICATION PROCESS BEING CONSIDERED IN REGARDS TO THE- OVERALL DEMAND. AND THE RELIABILITY OF THE GRID AND WHAT STEPS IS THE CPUC TAKING. TO ADDRESS THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION NEVER ON THE ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- AS YOU SAY AS YOU STATED WE ARE MEETING OUR GHG GOALS- IN AND THE ENERGY SIDE OF THE FENCE WE ARE BEHIND- AND THEN IN THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE AS CHAIRMAN HAWKSHAW SAID- SOME OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNOR HAS DONE NOT NOT ONLY IN THE MAY REVISED EARLIER AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ARE CRITICAL TO ADVANCING MORE LIKE TO VACATION- OF OUR TRANSPORTATION- SECTOR WHICH OF COURSE IT REPRESENTS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT. OF OUR G. H. G. SO. IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT- I THINK I THINK CHAIR HAWK SHIELD REALLY DESCRIBE VERY WELL THAT- AS WE INCREASE OUR ELECTRIC. VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE AND THE WORLD FOR THAT MATTER. THOSE ARE LITTLE POWER PLANTS PLANTS IF YOU WILL THEY THEY WILL BE ABLE TO STORE A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY AND THAT ENERGY CONNECT BE EXPENDED- WHEN IT'S MOST NEEDED. AT TIMES OF DAY WHEN- SOLAR AND WIND ARE ABATING- SO WE ARE WE HAVE PASSED SEVERAL ON DECISIONS THAT HAVE- FUNDED OR- ALLOWED FOR PROCUREMENT OF NOT ONLY ON. EXPANSION OF. CHARGING STATIONS IN SAN DIEGO AND IN AND THE SAN DIEGO SERVICE TERRITORY IN THE EDISON TERRITORY PRIOR TO MY COMING ON TO THE COMMISSION THERE'VE BEEN OTHER. MAJOR EXPANSIONS OF WHAT WE AS A COMMISSION HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF ELECTRIC- VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS IN PARTICULAR- I REALLY THINK THAT SURE HOW SHE'LL PROBABLY HAS A GREAT DEAL TO STICK TO- SAY ABOUT THE SUBJECT AS WELL IF I MAY TURN TO HIM. TO ADD TO THAT THE RESPONSE. THANK YOU PRESIDENTIAL I WOULD JUST ADD YOU KNOW IN THE MAY REVISED BUDGET YOU KNOW THERE'S- A TWO POINT ONE BILLION FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION HALF OF THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. IN CONCERT WITH A MAJOR PUSH FROM FROM THE PC- AND CARBS WELL BECAUSE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR US BUT IT IS ACTUALLY MANAGEABLE- JUST FOR CONTEXT IT OFF FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT AN 8% INCREASE IN OUR ELECTED DEMAND. HOW WITH YOUR PERMISSION ASSEMBLY WOMAN LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUE COMMISSIONER GOODELL JUST TO SPEAK TO THIS. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN DOING THE MODELING FROM A- AS THOUSAND YEAR CAN UP WITH ANSWER. WOULD TO REMIND YOU I'M FROM EMINEM- SO I VERY SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED ALSO IN WHAT IS HAPPENING. IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND ALSO SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY- VEHICLES AS OPPOSED TO JUST LIKE DUTY YES LET ME LET ME SPEAK TO THAT IF I COULD BRIEFLY WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING SECTOR EVERY SINGLE MAJOR. AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURER IN THE WORLD IS INTRODUCING AN INVESTING HEAVILY NOW IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES- THE FORD F. ONE FIFTY WHICH PRESIDENT BIDEN- VISIT THAT MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT IS GOING ELECTRIC. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR'S CHEVY SILVERADO ALSO COMING OUT WITH A FOUR HUNDRED MILE RANGE. ELECTRIC VERSION AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MUCH MUCH MORE THAT INTO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY AS WELL- OBVIOUSLY TEXAS MAKING ELECTRIC SEMI THERE'S A THERE'S A BUNCH OF ACTIVITY THERE- I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER SECTOR START- SORT OF THE PIONEER BUT THEN. AS BATTERY COSTS COME DOWN BASICALLY A HUNDRED DOLLARS A KILOWATT HOURS WHEN ELECTRIC VEHICLE BECOMES CHEAPER. THAN A CONVENTIONAL VEHICLES WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY NOW BUT THERE'S A PATHWAY TO GET TO EIGHTY- SO THIS IS WHY ALL THE CAR COMPANIES ARE INVESTING. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THIS MASSIVE SHIFT BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET WILL HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MODELS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AVAILABLE FOR SALE SO. A HUGE INCREASE OUR PREDICAMENT YOU'RE GONNA. MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS QUESTION. YEAH I'M THINKING. M. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. THE QUESTION THEY'RE JUST HIGH LEVEL I THINK I WANT TO COVER TWO OR THREE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING DO. I TO HELP PREPARE FOR THIS AND SINCE. SO WHAT I THINK IS TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ON WE AND WE ARE IN TERMS OF. THE PEAK DEMAND CONTRIBUTION AND THE ENERGY CONTRIBUTION. FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES TODAY I WANT TO BE IN ANTICIPATING IN TWENTY THIRTY AND WORK WITH ANTICIPATING IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO DO ON. ENSURING WE COULD USE SOME OF THOSE AS STORAGE ON THE- OF THE OTHER TECHNICAL SUPPORT FROM A CHARGING PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO. CONVINCE THAT'S PERFECT. SO TO BEGIN WITH TODAY THE OTHER TWO VEHICLES CONTRIBUTE AND REALLY NEGLIGIBLE OF BOOKS pWELL AS- THE PEAK DEMAND PERSPECTIVE. THAT LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OUR CURRENT MODELING I SUGGEST THAT AT THE END OF TECHNICALS WILL CONTRIBUTE. A CLOSE TO A ONE POINT NINE ARE CLOSE 22% AFTER THE PEAK DEMAND IN TWENTY THIRTY. AND UPWARDS OF 4% CLOSE 25% IN TWENTY. THIRTY EST ANIMAL CONSUMPTION GOALS. IN TWENTY FIFTY OR TWENTY FORTY FIVE TIME FRAME WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT NUMBER EXPANDING TO ALMOST 20% OF ELECTRIC ENERGY USAGE IN THE STATE. SO A FEW THINGS WERE TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW THE OF CHARGE TODAY AND GATHER INFORMATION AND DOUBLE UP SCENARIOS ON HOW THEY CAN OPTIMALLY CHARGING DECLARED. A TIE SO AS A PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY I FOR. THE QUESTION THAT THE LAND A FEW SCENARIOS TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO CHARGE TO ENSURE GREATER. WE MODEL SOME OF THOSE AT THIS LAST YEAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO MODEL THEM- TO PROVIDE MORE SITUATIONAL BUSINESS. ON THIS TOPIC YOU ALSO RAISED A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES SB SIX TO DEMAND RESPONSE. AS WELL AS THE ARMY SOURCES. SO WE ARE MODELING AS A PART OF THE SP. ONE HUNDRED AND NOW SAYS AS WELL AS THE ANY THIRTY. HOW DO TO THINK ABOUT AVAIL. AND DRD SOURCE ON THE- AND YOU THINK TO WHAT THAT'S ME FROM A BULK AT TO A DISTRIBUTION. A GOOD PLANNING AND IN CLOSE CO. WITH CPUS. AND PROVIDING DOZEN. THE SO. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A- AS QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE BUT THAT'S A HIGH LEVEL CALL. OKAY AND YOUR QUESTION. I COULD A GOOD TO HAVE THE X. GIVING ANSWERS WE JUST GET ASK ANSWER ASK THE QUESTION. BUT I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR OWN. CHAIR CHILD. AND WANT TO GO BACK TO THE IN THE FINDINGS ON THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. IT'S SUGGESTED AND I'LL QUOTE THE ENERGY ENTITIES SHOULD PRIORITIZE AND ARTICULATE A CONTINGENCY PLAN. IN THE EVENT FURTHER ANTICIPATED EVENTS OCCUR SO THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES THAT OCCURRED IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ARE READILY MOBILIZED IF NEEDED. NOW IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SO YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY WORKING ON THIS CONTINGENCY PLAN THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BEFORE SUMMER. I ASKED MY STAFF WHEN THE SUMMER BEGAN THEY SAID JUNE TWENTIETH SO MY QUESTION IS WILL THE CONTINGENCY PLAN BE READY BEFORE JUNE TWENTIETH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WERE ACTUALLY I I'D LIKE TO ASK COMMISSION GOOD TO SPEAK TO THAT IS DEVELOPING. YEAH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST AT A HIGH LEVEL OF THE CONTINGENCY PLANNING- WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I. PROVIDE THE CONTEXT HERE OKAY SO HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO TEST ESTABLISHED IN MEANS THAT HAS MENTIONED. TO REALLY THINK THROUGH SOME TABLE TOP EXERCISES ON THE SOME OF THE CONTINGENCIES. I JUST. ANSWER THE QUESTION A TEN THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL AND WE CAN GO INTO DETAIL IF YOU WOULD LIKE. WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND TALK THROUGH THE PROCESS ON HOW BEST TO ENSURE THAT THIS CONTINGENCIES ARE AVAILABLE. ARE SOME OF THE CONTINGENCIES INCLUDE OUR DEPENDENCE ON THE NEIGHBORING BALANCING AUTHORITIES- IN COORDINATION WITH THAT CPAC HI SO. WE DID A SUMMER AT IN THIS WORKSHOP A WEEK AGO AFTER A WEEK AGO AND THAT'S THAT'S YOU TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS. SO WE EXPECT A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUR BALANCING AND NEIGHBORING BALANCING AUTHORITIES- WE DO HAVE A VERY CLOSE COORDINATION I HAVE A D. W. R. I. TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST THEY CAN SUPPORT OF SOMEBODY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO. SUPPORT SIGNIFICANTLY LAST YEAR- BUT THAT DOESN'T. LOOK LIKE A FEASIBLE AS WE MOVE IN BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS BUT THEY WILL STILL DO WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO. ON THE TOP OF THAT AND INTERESTING MEANS THERE AND- LISTENED AB THAT'S IT HAS MENTIONED AT THE EFFORTS ON AND SPECIFICALLY THE FLEX ALERT THAT'S ANOTHER CONTINGENCY. OVERALL BETWEEN THE NUMEROUS AMOUNT OF CONTINGENCIES THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY. WE WE BELIEVE CAUTIOUSLY THAT THAT'S ENOUGH TO. SUPPORT AN EXTREME SITUATION. IN IN SPECIFICALLY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION ON BAND THAT WOULD BE PUBLIC- WE ARE HOPING TO MAKE. KIND OF A WRITTEN DOCUMENT AT A HIGH LEVEL PUBLIC FROM THE THREE AGENCIES- IN A MONTH. TIME FRAME THAT JUST PROVIDES HIGH LEVEL COORDINATION ELEMENT AND HIGH LEVEL MEASURES WHAT. THANK YOU- I WILL BEFORE I TURN TO KIRK WHO HAD A COURSE ASKING WHY TO SCANNED THE ROOM. WAS THE CUNNINGHAM WE HAVE- ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH TO ASK THE SUMMIT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS FOR MR MAINS- AND IT'S JUST A SIMPLE ONE BUT I'M CURIOUS AS TO. HIS TAKE ON IT- WHAT IS THE STATE'S SINGLE GREATEST RISK FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR. WELL I THINK FOR THEIR REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW WORSE I THINK WE'RE NOPE WE'RE SAT LARGELY SAID AT THIS POINT WITH THE GENERATION FLEET WE HAVE A WE'VE GOT OUR OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK IT IS GOOD SHAPE WE POSSIBLY CAN BE IN TERMS BOTH THE GENERATION FLEET THE TRANSMISSION LINES. I THINK THE COMMUNICATION COORDINATION PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN VASTLY. IMPROVED I THINK THERE WERE IS THE OUR OF A EXTRA HOT WEST WIDE HEATING ABOUT NO THAT'S WHAT US LAST YEAR AND THAT'S THE THIS THAT I THINK PLAN THE GREATEST FOR- WE KNOW THIS YEAR WERE ALL EX. A WARM CHAMP- THE HYDRO CONDITIONS NOT JUST AS THEY WILL BE LIKE TO BE SIGNATURE BELOW AVERAGE THE THIS MORNING TO GRAB WHAT THIRD DRY WATER YEAR RECORD. IN SO THE HIGH CONDITION OR STRESS. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING FIRES AND SO YOU KNOW IF WE SEE THIS PATTERN. OF EXTREME HEATING. THAT CONTINGENCY PLAN. THAT COMMISSIONER GOING TO JUST TO GOING TO BE DEPLOYED- VERY VERY ACTIVELY AND WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING TO MAXIMIZE COMMUNICATION COORDINATION AMONGST ALL THE UTILITIES. AND WE WILL BE ASKING CONSUMERS TO TAKE SPECIFIC STEPS SPOKE BEFORE. OF THE HEATING VENTS YOU KNOW THE MORNING THE AFTERNOON PRE COOLING THEIR HOMES. LOOKING FOR WAYS TO KEEP THE- KEEP THE HOMES THIS COUNTRY AS POSSIBLE EVEN PRE PRE COOKING MEALS AND THEN WE GET TO THE FOUR O'CLOCK TO NINE PM OUR- WHEN THE GRID STARTS EXPERIENCING THAT STRESSES THE SUN STARTS SETTING IN ROAD SPEAK UP- WILL BE ASKING FOLKS TO. YOU KNOW REALLY REDUCE THEIR USE OF MAJOR APPLIANCES. HOW TO TURN OFF UNNECESSARY LIGHTS. AND ALSO IF THERE HEALTH SUPPORTS IT TO KEEP THAT THERMOSTATIC ROUGHLY SEVENTY EIGHT DEGREES AND COLLECTIVELY. IF THEY LEAN IN WITH US. WE CAN. HOPEFULLY MAKE IT THROUGH WITHOUT ANY ROTATING OUTAGES THE PRESENT EXTREME HEATING SCENARIO. THAT IS THE ONE THAT I THINK WE'RE MOST WORRIED ABOUT. THANK YOU. OUR DOCTOR GROUP YOU HAD A THE QUESTION. THANK YOU CHAIR- WE'VE TALKED QUITE A BIT OF THE- THE PANEL HAS ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NET IMPORTERS. OUR WHICH I SUSPECT. HAS A LONG HISTORY PROBABLY FOR FINANCIAL REASONS THAT IT'S PROBABLY CHEAPER TO IMPORT THEM TO BUILD A PLANT HERE OR YOU KNOW WHAT DOES BECAUSE THE FACT THAT WE'RE DOING SO MUCH MORE IMPORTING AND EXPORTING. I CHANGE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT- SURE PRESIDENT DR WE CAN GET. YOU KNOW HOW CALIFORNIA IN WHICH WE ARE WE ARE IN MANY WAYS FORTUNATE AND YOU KNOW WE SAW THIS PLAY OUT EARLIER THIS YEAR. NO TEXAS WOULD THAT THAT WE ARE PART OF A VASTLY CONNECTED WESTERN UTILITY GRANT. AND CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ACTUALLY AT THE NET IMPORTER OF ELECTRICITY FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND IT SPEND. SOMETHING IN MANY WAYS IT'S BEEN MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. FOR THE CHASE REGION AYE AYE I SPENT THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS WORKING ARE A PART OF A PARENT MINISTRATION WE ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THOSE IMPORTS WE ARE THE EXPORTER TO CALIFORNIA DURING THIS. LATE SPRING AND THE SUMMER IS THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR OF OUR AVAILABLE HYDRO AND THEN WHEN WE GET INTO THE WINTER WHEN CALIFORNIA CHEST STRAP LOWER LEVELS WE WOULD IMPORT OUR- HOW TO CALIFORNIA TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST FOR WINTER PEAKING SYSTEM SO THE EXCHANGE OF ENERGY CAPACITY BETWEEN REGIONS IS VERY VALUABLE AND WE HAVE AN IMPORTER. THE PROBLEM AND THE CHALLENGE NOW THAT WE HAVE TO PAY MUCH MUCH MUCH GREATER ATTENTION TO. IS JUST. RECOGNIZING THAT AS WE CHANGE OUR REESE MAY AND WE WERE TO THE CAR VERSUS AND WE ARE SELF NATURAL GAS- THE WHICH THE NATURE F THE TYPE OF RESEARCH. THAT WERE PUTTING ON THE GRID- IN CONTINUE TO THAT CLASS. THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCE ACROSS THE WAY. THERE'S A LOT OF TRANSMISSION IN. THE ACROSS THE WEST WE CAN. TO TAKE A OF THIS CAPABILITY BUT NOT BECOME OVERLY RELIANT TOWARD AND CERTAINLY HIGHLY CONSCIOUS THE OF THE WHEN. OF THE BACK OF. AND CONTINUE CAPE. IF WE GET INTO THIS EXTREME HEAT. EVENTS SO I CAN. HOW WERE. BONNEVILLE POWER TO. YOU GOT MORE THAN YOU. NOW AREA. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'RE IMPORTING I BELIEVE FROM ALL OVER THE WEST AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHAT BECAUSE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE LESS GENERATION IN THE STATE- SO THAT WERE NET IMPORTERS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE KNOWS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION OTHER THAN ITS ECONOMICS BUT- MAYBE THE CPUC OR THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS AN IDEA. WELL NUMBER I THINK YOU NAILED THE- THE NAIL ON THE HEAD IT'S IT IS IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH ECONOMICS AND IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THAT. AS AS PRESIDENT- AND CEO MEANS- IT IS SAID IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH WHERE- WHERE THE ENERGY IS ONE THERE'S NEATLY UP WE HAVE STATES THAT- WE'RE NEIGHBORS NEIGHBORS OF OURS THAT HAVE A GREATER NEED IN THE WINTER THAN WE DO AND WE HAVE A GREATER NEED IN THE SUMMER THAN THEY DO. SO IT'S SAY A FLOW AND THAT LUCKILY WE'RE- VERY. CAPABLE OF MANAGING AND- TAKING PART OF- BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S BOTH THE TYPE OF SEASONAL NEEDS WE HAVE AND ECONOMICS. I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT ONE ONE POINT OF SETTLEMENT KIRK WHICH IS I THINK IT DOES A CREW TO OUR% BENEFIT OVER TIME TO BE CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THE WEST AND IF YOU COMPARE HERE WE'RE ALL HERE IN THIS HEARING HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. BECAUSE OF AN OUTAGE THAT LASTED TWO HOURS ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND THEN OUR HALF ON AUGUST FIFTEENTH AFFECTED ABOUT HALF MILLION CUSTOMERS THE OUTAGE THAT TEXAS HAD. FEBRUARY WAS FIVE HUNDRED TIMES WORSE SO pCONSERVE THEY HAD- EIGHT HUNDRED WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS. AND THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY AN ISLAND AND SO I THINK VERY MUCH YOU KNOW. THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD- YOU KNOW ACCESS TO SURROUNDING RESTORED MEAN JUST GENERALLY. I DO THINK THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REST WEST- HAS ITS BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA. YEAH I TURN NINETY THREE ON THAT. I'M CERTAINLY SUPPORTER OF A WIDER BALANCING AUTHORITY WITH THE I SO. CALIFORNIA IS SO MERGING WITH OTHERS BUT- WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A- A NICE DREAM HOW NOT SURE WE'LL EVER GET THERE BUT DIE I APPRECIATE THAT- THERE'S- BETTER COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BALANCING AUTHORITIES AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WILL HAVE TO DO IF WE CAN'T. GET AROUND SOME OF THESE POLITICAL PROBLEMS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NUMBER EIGHTY FIVE IF I MAY I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD ONE ADDITIONAL DETAILS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIA IS GOING THROUGH- YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE ADEQUACY. CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW IN AND REALLY WORKING ON THAT ISSUE WITH A WITH ALL OF ITS CAPABILITY BUT WE ARE NOT UNIQUE IN THAT- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS NOW. PLAYING ACROSS THE WEST UNITED STATES ACTUALLY ALL OF THE MAJOR SUBREGIONS AND WESTERNIZED STATES ARE DEPENDENT 21 DEGREES ANOTHER ON IMPORTS. AND ACTUALLY THE COMPETITION FOR THOSE IMPORTS IS NOW BECOMING INCREASINGLY. STRONG AND SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ARE GIVEN THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BUY POWER FROM OTHER REGIONS IS THAT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH WERE DEPENDENT. ON THOSE IMPORTS FOR OUR PEAK NEEDS WE NEED TO HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO FORWARD CONTRACTING IN LINE AT THE SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT FORWARD BASIS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ARE UTILITIES IN THE STATE INCREASING ATTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE HEDGING. THEIR EXPOSURE TO BILLS PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS IT'S A IT'S THAT FORWARD CONTRACTING IN THOSE LONGER TERM- BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS. INTO THE BROADER MARKET THAT COULD SUPPORT THAT CAN HELP US. MANAGE THAT INTERDEPENDENCY WITHOUT IT. BECOMING TOO MUCH OF A LIABILITY FOR US. YEAH MY CONCERN THERE IS JUST THE WE HAVE ALL THE C. C. MANY OF WHICH ARE QUITE SMALL. AND DINNER SO I WORRY ABOUT. COORDINATION OF THE GOING TO BE SUPPLYING. OF VERY LARGE FRACTION OF THE STATE'S ENERGY PROBABLY ALL OF IT IN SAN DIEGO AND PATERNITY- AND- JUST THE FACT THAT THERE. MANY OF THEM ARE JUST VERY SMALL IT'S HARD TO SEE HOW THAT- HOW WE COORDINATE THAT. DR KIRK REALLY APPRECIATE IT- THAT QUESTION AND CERTAINLY ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS KEEP THE FAITH- THERE IS- OR THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY- IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK AND THEN WE'LL TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT- AND AS DR COURT MENTIONED A CALIFORNIA REMAINS STRONGLY IMPORT DEPENDENT. HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DO WE HAVE ANOTHER WESTERN WIDE HEATWAVE OCCURS THAT OUR IMPORTS WILL SHOW UP. AND WHAT ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS OR TOOLS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR OUR SYSTEM PLANNING GIVEN THE REGIONAL NATURE OF OUR ELECTRIC GRID AND RESOURCE PORTFOLIO. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO. EXPLAINING IT THAT FIRST YEAH OKAY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW- CHILDREN THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR QUESTION AND JUST FOR FREE SHAKE IT GENTLY YOUR ENGAGEMENT UP ON THOSE TOPICS YOU KNOW THE- THE ISSUE OF IMPORTS AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF A WIDESPREAD HEATING EVENTS- ARE THE SINGLE PUBLIC BIGGEST RISK VARIABLE- THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OUR OUR SUMMER ASSESSMENT THIS UC'S ANALYSIS ARE ALL LOOKING AT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT AND SO ALL OF OUR CONTINGENCY PLANNING. ALL OF OUR RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE REALLYBASED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO RIDE TO THAT SCENARIO WITH BETTER RESULTS THAN WE HAD LAST YEAR AND I WOULD EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW THE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION AND THE COLLABORATION WITH OUR ADJACENT SYSTEM OPERATORS AND UTILITIES IT'S JUST BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER PART OF OUR FUTURE SUCCESS IN SERVE BETWEEN THE BRIGHTNESS ROUND TABLES AND THE TABLE TOP EXERCISES. AND OF COURSE- TO CONTINUED STRENGTHENING OF OUR ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED WITH WITH UTILITIES ACROSS THE WEST WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A PATHWAY TO NOT ONLY STRENGTHENING OUR ABILITY TO WRITE THROUGH DISTURBANCES LIKE WE SAW LAST SUMMER BUT JUST IN GENERAL I TO CREATE MORE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND INTO CREASE THE EFFICIENCY AND THE ABILITY AND THE RESILIENCE. OF OUR SYSTEM SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE- OUR OUR EFFORTS TO WORK AS COLLABORATIVELY WITH AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE UTILITIES ACROSS THE WEST REACHING OUT TO CALIFORNIA. UNDERSTANDING OR CODEPENDENCY IS A WARNING TO CONTINUE TO CALL OF ALL BUT THAT'S NOT I THINK IT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO DERIVE VALUE FOR ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA IN INDIA AND DRIVE PROGRESS ACROSS THE WEST AS WELL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE BOB WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'LL TURN TO ANYONE WHO'S IN THE GALLERY FIRST IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS. ON PUBLIC COMMENT WHO WERE IN THE GALLERY OF- WILL TURN TO YOU KNOW WE SENATORS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTER MR CHIU MISTER BY CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS TERRELL OF LAJOS ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY WE DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- ATTENTION TO- RELIABILITY PG&amp;E IS COMMITTED TO SAFELY DELIVERING RELIABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND WE'RE DOING OUR PART. IN MORE TO HELP THE STATE ACHIEVE ITS RELIABILITY OBJECTIVES EVEN THOUGH P. GENIES ENERGY. CREASED AS CUSTOMERS HAVE MIGRATED TO OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. WE HAVE NEVERTHELESS BEEN ASKED TO STEP UP AND SUPPORT STATEWIDE RELIABILITY EFFORTS INCLUDING BY PROCURING RESOURCES FOR NON PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS FOR THIS SUMMER. WE'RE DOING MUCH OF THIS THROUGH THE CPC'S ENERGY EMERGENCY RELIABILITY PROCEEDING- WHICH EARLIER THIS YEAR DIRECTED THE IOUS TO PROCURE SUBSTANTIAL. DEMAND AND SUPPLY SIDE RESOURCES FOR THIS COMING SUMMER ON BEHALF OF DOZENS OF LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN THE AYE SO FOOT PRINT. DESPITE A TIGHT ENERGY SUPPLY MARKET IN THE WESTERN U. S. AND UNIQUELY TIGHT TIMELINES TO PROCURE INCREMENTAL RESOURCES FOR THE SUMMER PG&amp;E IS LEAVING NO STONE UNTURNED IN OUR EFFORTS TO HELP THE STATE PROCURE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THE EMERGENCY PER CLIPS ARE SUPPLY PROCUREMENT. WE ARE MAKING OTHER EFFORTS SUCH AS SOFTWARE UPGRADE CENTER GATEWAY AND COLUSA GENERATING STATIONS TO INCREASE THEIR OUTPUT WE CAN DEPLOY A TEMP CHEN DESIGNED FOR PS PS IF NEEDED- WE'VE ALSO PROCURED HUNDREDS OF MEGAWATTS OF BATTERY STORAGE- MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THAT WERE PART OF PRIOR. CPUC ORDERS MUCH OF WHICH HAVE. CONTRACTUAL ONLINE DATES OF AUGUST FIRST. AS PRESIDENT BADGER MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY DEMAND RESPONSE EFFORTS FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER P. GINNY IS TARGETING TO PROVIDE FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS THROUGH OUR DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS AND OF COURSE CUSTOMERS. HEAVY OUTREACH- TO OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS ABOUT HOW THEY CAN TAKE ACTION TO HELP REDUCE THEIR ENERGY DEMAND DURING HOT SUMMER DAYS. AND FINALLY MISTER CHAIR IN CONCLUSION. IF DESPITE THESE BEST EFFORTS THE I SO DETERMINES THERE IS A RELIABILITY EMERGENCY AND ORDERS ROTATING OUTAGES THIS SUMMER. WE'RE PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT THE ISO'S DECISION THROUGH A NEW PROCESS OPERATED REMOTELY BY SKATER. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO EXEMPT THE CENTRAL CUSTOMERS FROM ROTATING OUTAGES IMPACT YOUR CUSTOMERS AND RESTORE POWER MORE QUICKLY. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU. NEXT BAKER CHAIR HOLDEN VICE CHAIR PATTERSON AND MEMBERS I'M VERY MULLIN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS LOCAL PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT SERVE A QUARTER OF THE STATE. RELIABILITY IS PARAMOUNT AND CALIFORNIA'S PO USE TAKE SERIOUSLY THEIR OBLIGATION TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. MORE THAN HALF OF THE STATE'S PO YOU'D PROVIDE ELECTRIC SERVICE AND COMMUNITY OWN BALANCING AUTHORITIES WHICH MANAGE THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY. DURING THE AUGUST THE WAY THESE COMMUNITY ON AGENCIES HELP SUPPLY POWER TO THE ISO GRID OR REDUCE THEIR ISO IMPORTS. THE STATE'S OTHER PO USE SERVE IN THE ISO BALANCING AUTHORITY DURING THE AUGUST THE WAY THESE PEOPLE USING COURAGE CUSTOMERS TO CONSERVE ENERGY. A RAMPED UP THEIR OWN GENERATION OUTPUT TO ASSIST THE GRID. ALL CALIFORNIA PO USE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE AUGUST TO FURTHER ENHANCE THEIR SUMMER PREPAREDNESS INCLUDING COORDINATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ISO. THE PEER USE OUR PARTNERS IN ENSURING RELIABILITY AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DIALOGUE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CHI SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THERE ARE ONLY TWO THAT I UNDERSTOOD WE'RE IN THE GALLERY THAT HAD COMMENTS BUT IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN pSUPPLY CHEERING COMMITTEE- MY NAME SUNNY SUMMER I REPRESENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY AND WORK CLOSELY WITH ANOTHER NUMBER NUMBER OF MY PO YOU PARTNERS- SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY. SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE READINESS AND RELIABILITY IS A KEY AND HIGH PRIORITY FOR NCPA. AND THE EVENTS OF TWENTY TWENTY AND C. K. AND ARE. YOU PARTNERS WORK TO SUPPORT RELY BILLION SYSTEM BY INCREASING GENERATION CAPACITY DURING HIGH LOAD EVENTS AND DURING TIMES OF NEED. WORK TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION PRODUCED IN OUR COMMUNITIESTO SUPPORT RELIABILITY. ALSO WORKED TO CONSERVE. POWER AND WORK FOR THE CUSTOMERS TO INSURE THAT WE COULD HELP REDUCE STRESS FROM THE GRID. BUT AS WE WILL AS WE WORK TO LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE INCIPIENT APPEAR YOUR PARTNERS. ARE SQUARELY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE'RE WELL PREPARED AND POSITIONED TO SUPPORT RELIABILITY IN THE SYSTEM LOOKING FORWARD. TO THE KEY AREAS THAT WE'VE REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS PART OF OUR PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES. IS FOCUSED ON RESILIENCY TO ENSURE THAT WERE PROPERLY MAINTAINING OUR GENERATION FACILITIES SO THAT. THEY'RE READY TO OPERATE AT THE TIME OF NEED. FOCUSING ON ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN. A FUEL- DEPENDENT FIELD- DURABILITY IN OUR SYSTEM PARTICULAR WE OWN AND OPERATE A NUMBER OF LARGE HYDROELECTRIC FACILITIES. IN THE LIGHT OF THE CURRENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SYSTEM SAY. WE'RE WORKING TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN AS MUCH DISCRETIONARY GENERATION AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN. SUPPORT THE GRADE AT THE TIME OF NEED ALSO WORKING TO MANAGE AND HARDEN OUR SYSTEMS FOR WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS. IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT IN PAST EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN WILDFIRE CONDITIONS. SOME OF OUR GENERATION FACILITIES ARE UNABLE TO OPERATE DURING TIMES OF NEED SO WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING TO. IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO MITIGATE THAT RISK SO THAT IN THE EVENT THAT WE EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE OF CONDITIONS. THE CHANCE OF A GENERATION BEING AVAILABLE AS HIGH I. AND EMPATHETIC SECONDLY FOCUS ON HIGH LEVEL OF COORDINATION EFFORT AS NOTED IN THE DISCUSSION DURING THE PRIOR PORTION OF THIS MEETING. WE HAVE AND WE'RE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OUR GREAT OPERATOR TO ENSURE THAT WE TEST OUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION. SO IN THE- MOMENT OF NEED WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE CAN COORDINATE AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE AND WE SHOULD RESPOND IN A COORDINATED WAY. WITH A GREAT OPERATOR AND ALSO WORKING ACTIVELY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND ENGAGE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO INSURE THAT WE DEVELOP. PROPER COMMUNICATION TOOLS SO WHEN THE SYSTEM IS UNDER STRESS CONDITION WE HAVE THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO COMMUNICATE THAT SITUATION SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FOR CUSTOMERS. TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL CONSERVATION AND IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL GENERATION SUPPORT THROUGH. THE USE OF DISTRIBUTED GENERATION RESOURCES WE JUST WANT TO PROVIDE THESE COMMENTS TODAY TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE THAT WE ARE WORKING AT WORKING ACTIVELY OUR PARTNERS TO ENSURE. WE'RE PREPARED FOR THE SUMMER- IN FRONT OF US. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENTS. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS IS THERE ANYONE. ELSE IN THE GALLERY THAT WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE A STATEMENT OR ASK A QUESTION. SAN NINE WILL TURN TO OF WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE.

THE TERM MEMBER LEARNING MORE REPRESENTING SAID MAC WHICH IS- THE ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS THE DEMAND RESPONSE IN THE STREET. SACRAMENTO BUT WE HEARD TODAY DEMAND RESPONSE POLITICAL WON'T STABILIZE IN THE GREAT LAST AUGUST FADING AND TAKE A LOT OF POWER EVEN THOUGH MARKET CONDITIONS ARGUABLY ONE WERE NOT IDEAL. TO SUPPORT THAT CONTRIBUTION FOR EXAMPLE THE RESOURCES HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHER RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO BE RESOURCE ADEQUATE YOU NEED. IN ORDER FOR DEMAND AFTER THE DEMAND RESPONSE WEEK RESOURCE TO BE WELL. AND BE ABLE TO BE UTILIZED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE OPENLY IN THE MARKETPLACE. WITH FEWER CONSTRAINTS. INTO WAR FOR QUESTION REMOVAL OF SOME OF THE CURRENT IMPEDIMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY CONSTRAIN. THE UTILIZATION OF THIS RESOURCE. CLAIM IF ABOLITION OF A D. R. REDUCE PARK. FOR THIS COMING SUMMER. THE ELIMINATION OF COULD PROCUREMENT. X. BUDGET FOR THE DEMAND RESPONSE ACTION MECHANISM GRAM. BUT I ATTENTION THE RIVER. TO D. R.

I THINK YOU HELLO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY- AND AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT MY NAME IS JULIA POSH NICK AND I AM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION AMONG THE CPC CC CAROUSEL AND THE HARD WORK TO THE STAFF AND APPEARING FOR THE SUMMER IN THE PROCUREMENT OF SHORT TERM STORAGE. WE ENCOURAGE THE AGENCY TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM TO PLANNING FOR CARE LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE THE UPCOMING- SUMMER TEACHER. VERY A LOT OF GREAT. MIGRATION ENERGY STARTED A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ENSURING CALIFORNIA CAN WHICH IS KIND OF GO. AS OUTLINED IN AS HE HUNDRED. AND WE HONOR CLIMB EMERGENCY ARE BECAUSE NEARLY IN THAT. THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE FOR TWO. PERMITTING AND BUILDING THAT AT THIS. AND CAN MAKE. THE FACTORY CAN MOVE TOWARDS OUR ENERGY GOALS. COURSE BEGIN COUNCIL THAT ON THE STATE. AND YOU CAN TO APPROACH. OUR KIND OF DEADLINE EIGHTY MUST FOCUS ON INCLUSIVE ACCORDING PLANNING. FOR THEM THE IN SECURING NEW CLEAN AND RESEARCH. A CALIFORNIA AGENCY WE CAN STEPPING TO MAKE HAPPEN QUICKER WE ARE OF AN INCORRECT PRESSURE THESE CLEAN ENERGY EFFORTS. ALLEN IN THE FINAL ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT IN THE LAST HONEST I CATCH THE MORE ACTIONS THAT CAN BE COMPLETED THIS SUMMER THE BETTER OUR CHANCES IN THE ARTICLES WILL BE. FOUNDATION AND STORAGE. THE COURT THE WEAPON AGENCIES AND AGREES TO STAY IS INSTRUCTOR POSITION GOING INTO SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LAST SUMMER CAROUSEL'S GPT HAS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL REVENUE OUT OF THE ATTENTION NOTHING LIKE JEFFREY WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS SUMMER BUT WE CAN'T STOP THERE AND MUST CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK AND INSURANCE I'M SURE WE ARE PLANNING A PROCURING FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND NEXT. POSTED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CHALLENGES OF MAINTAINING AVAILABLE GRAD ACCIDENT EXPECTED TO GROW IN THE COMING DECADES AGO MARGARET NOBLE COME ONLINE MY BASIC RESOURCES ARE TAKEN OFFLINE I LIKE TO SEE DEMAND GROWS FROM ELECTRIFY.

TO ENSURE WE ARE READY FOR THE NEXT COMPLEMENT THE- THANK YOU CAN THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE. REMOVING A COLON UNDER WE CAN BE YOUR WORK. AND DEDICATION TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU NEXT A LITTLE ONE OF TWENTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YOUR NUMBER- THAT YOU'RE HOLDEN BY SURE PATTERSON BURKE AT THE COMMITTEE RIGHT BACK AND WE ON BEHALF OF DIRECT ENERGY AND IS CURRENT COMPANY AND R. G. THANK YOU TODAY FOR THIS IMPORTANT HEARING AT AGE DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDER IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE PLEASED TO MEET THE COST ANALYSIS. RECOGNIZING THAT NOT ONLY THEIR ACTED PROVIDERS HAD MET OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY OBLIGATION BUT ALSO HAD THE MOST ACCURATE DATA HAS MOBILE CAPS WHICH MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON THE CALIFORNIA I. S. O. TO MAKE A BILL CURRENT ADJUSTMENT LAST AUGUST. CURRENTLY DIRECT ENERGY IS EXCEEDING OUR BY OUR KEY RESORT ADEQUATELY PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS BY 40% WENT LONG TURN SOLAR AND ENERGY STORAGE CONTRACT. MEDIA REPORTS SAID ALONG WITH THE DIVERSE BIO ENERGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN OUR PORTFOLIO GOLD POSITION I BELIEVE COMPLY WITH OUR RPI IN A ONE HUNDRED OBLIGATION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU HOW WE CAN HELP COMPETITION WITH WITH- CCESS MODEL HELP SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S RELIABILITY CLEAN ENERGY AND. AFFORDABILITY COOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE NEXT ABOUT LINE OF THE THIRTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ADAM GAME. AND I'M THE WESTERN EDGE OF ADDRESS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS. I'M KNOW IF YOU'VE BEEN TO CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVING THE INCREASE IN EXTREME THAT WERE HE AND GET THREE THIRTY SHOWN. THAT WITHOUT ACTION TO REDUCE EMISSIONS BY MID CENTURY PERCENT OF THE SUBSTATION IN THE FAMILY VALUE WILL EXPAND THIRTY OR MORE DAYS PER YEAR OF EXTREME TEMPERATURES THAT COULD LEAD. TO QUITE A DETERIORATION AND FAILURE AND WE'VE OFFICE ENOUGH INFORMATION LINE FROM CONVOCATION UNDER EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS. SO WE SEE A CRITICAL THAT THE STATE FOCUSED ON RELIABILITY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE I'M A CONCLUDE NON WIRE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS THE MAN RESPONDED ENERGY STORAGE. AND MAYBE NOT CONTINUE. TO MOVE AWAY FROM RELYING ON NATURAL GAS POWER. IN ADDITION THE END ELECTION WEATHER ON ENERGY. DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT LOW IN AND- COMMUNITIES- HIGHER BILL THAT IN THE RATE- ON FIFTEEN. I'VE LOGGED ARE THE ON HEALTH AND PASS BECAUSE WITH PARA. THE COURT AS A POLLUTION IS BACKED BY OUR THE- WELL INCOME AND- COMMUNITIES. I WANT PROPOSAL THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE SEE A- THE SWINGLE. IS THAT COME CALIFORNIA BAR NOT A LINE. THAT WOULD COMPENSATE LOW INCOME HOW. FORTY ENERGY USE DURING. DURING SEVENTY PERIODS. SO HOPING THAT THE AND CONTAINED TOOK SCHOOL DEMAND ACCOMPLISH LIKE THAT ONE OUT OF THE- I'M TRYING TO INCREASE LIABILITY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT CAN YOU COMMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND MY TO ONE AND THEN ZERO ANY COM. MISTER WE HAVE NO FOR PUBLIC COMMENT Q. THANK YOU- NOT A MODERATOR WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE WHO- DECIDED TO BE A PARTOF THIS HEARING TODAY AND TO FIND OUT THE KIND OF WORK THAT OUR- ENERGY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN. ARE DILIGENTLY WORKING ON AND THEN ALSO TO SHARE YOUR COMMENTS WITH THE COMMITTEE IS VERY HELPFUL TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PROCESS- I'D LIKE TO TURN TO OUR MOISTURE- PATTERSON HE HAS SOME CLOSING COMMENTS AND THEN IF THERE ARE ANY. THOUGHTS THAT ANY OF OUR PANELISTS MIGHT HAVE THAT THEY LIKE TO TAKE. A MINUTE AND MAKE- WE CERTAINLY WILL- ALLOW THAT AND THEN WE WILL CLOSE OUT THIS HEARING. THRESHER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. UP EIGHT YEARS- I HAVE SERVED AS THE VICE CHAIR. OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SAME. DIFFICULTIES WE ARE FACING TODAY ARE THOSE THAT WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT YEARS. OUR RELIABILITY IS DECREASING WELL OUR COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE TO RATE PAYERS. AND HERE WE ARE TODAY GOING OVER THE SAME OLD GROUND. RELIABILITY KEEPS OUR. ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS- AWAKE AT NIGHT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT ENOUGH ELECTRICITY ON THE GRID FOR THE DEMAND. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING COSTS GOING UP. TO RATE PAYERS AND WHAT OUR SOLUTIONS- SAYING TO CALIFORNIANS WHEN YOU COME HOME ON A HOT DAY STOP USING YOUR AIR CONDITIONING BETWEEN FOUR AND NINE O'CLOCK OR WASH YOUR CLOTHES IN A MUCH MORE INCONVENIENT TIME FOR COOK YOUR DINNER DO OTHER CHORES THAT REQUIRE ELECTRICITY AFTER NINE. PM THIS IS NOT A REAL REALITY- THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN LIVE WITH. ON TOP OF THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING TIME OF USE RATES. PRICING AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING OUT OF THE REACH OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE CREATING WHAT AMOUNTS TO RATE INDUCED SCARCITY. AND UNDER THE PHRASE AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY AT DEMAND RESPONSE. WE ARE LITERALLY POWERING DOWN PORTIONS OF OUR ECONOMY. BECAUSE WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLY. THIS IS THE GRID THAT HAS BEEN CREATED. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON THE PLANET. HIGH COST QUESTIONABLE RELIABILITY PRICE INDUCED SCARCITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. AND WE'RE FORCING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE THE EXCRUCIATING CHOICE. YOU EITHER PAY RENT BUY GROCERIES OR PAY THE ELECTRICITY BILL. WE HEARD TODAY FROM MANY OF THOSE WHO HAD THE BUREAUCRACIES TO OPERATE THIS GREAT. I AM MAKING A PLEA FOR THE VOICES OF THOSE WHO HAVE TO USE THIS ELECTRICITY AND PAY FOR IT. UNRELIABILITY GOES DOWN AND COSTS GO UP MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FORCED AWAY FROM AN ELECTRICITY GRID THAT IS RELIABLE THAT THEY CAN GO TO THE WALL TURN IT ON. CAN AFFORD TO USE IT. WE CONTINUE TO SEE. THIS DIFFICULT DICHOTOMY RELIABILITY ON THE DECLINE. COST ON THE INCREASE ESSENTIALLY. TELLING PEOPLE TO USE THEIR ELECTRICITY AT INCONVENIENT TIMES. EMPOWERING DOWN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNFORTUNATELY IN EIGHT YEARS OF THE VICE CHAIRMANSHIP HERE I HAVE SEEN NOTHING- THAT WOULD SATISFY MY CONCERN. THAT WE ARE CREATING AN ADEQUATE GRID FOR THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE PLANET. WE- THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO THOUGH THAT WE'RE IN A TRANSITION PERIOD. WHICH BEGAN BEYOND THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED ON YOUR SERVICE. VALUABLE SERVICE TO THIS COMMITTEE. BUT THE TRANSITION IS MOVING US FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO RENEWABLE FORM OF ENERGY THAT CAN POWER GRID RECOGNIZING THE IMPACTS OF A DROUGHT THAT HAS A SUSTAINABLE DROUGHT. THE RECOGNIZING THAT THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING AND IMPACTING ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DO THINGS AS USUAL THEY GOT US INTO THIS MESS- WE ARE. WORKING HARD AS YOU KNOW AND- AND OUR ABILITY TO TRANSITION TO SMART TECHNOLOGY. STORAGE AND OTHER FORMS WE HAVE RESOURCES THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE. CONSULTANCY AREA LITHIUM DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL ALLOW FOR US TO HAVE GREATER TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES AROUND BATTERY STORAGE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF TRANSITION. AND I BELIEVE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS TRANSITION WE HAVE BEEN VERY DILIGENT TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE TAKING THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO PROTECT THE RATE PAYERS. AS YOU AND I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE ON. THE DISCUSSION THAT LED TO A QUESTION HERE TODAY. IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES EXPANDING. OUR IMPACT OF OUR GRID. AND COLLABORATING WITH OTHER STATES MEAN IN TERMS OF DRIVING COSTS DOWN. AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT IT IS GOING TO BE VERY VALUABLE TO THAT END. EVEN IN THE- EXPLORATION OF THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET IS LEADING US IN THE PAST THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET US IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE. SURE WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND ON THAT BUT EVEN IF WE JUST ARE AT THE PLACE OF UTILIZING THE YEAH I AM IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THE SERVICE IS NOT EASY- THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT AND WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING. AS WE GO THROUGH. YEARS OF MASSIVE WILDFIRES. NOW HEAT WAVES THAT ARE IMPACTING ON THE STABILITY OF THE GRID BUT AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING TRANSITION TO ADDRESS. THE NEED TO TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUEL. TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SO I THINK THAT- IT'S NOT EASY BUT GREAT THINGS DON'T HAPPEN EASILY- REQUIRES COMMITMENT IT REQUIRES DEDICATION IT REQUIRES. PERSEVERANCE AND WE HAVE TO DO THIS COLLABORATIVELY AS AN ENTIRE STATE AS INDUSTRY AS REGULATORY AS GOVERNMENT AS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE EVERYONE DOING THEIR PART. WE'RE IN UNCHARTED WATERS IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE- WHEN LAST SUMMER WE SAW A HUNDRED AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THOSE ARE SET AS DEATH VALLEY. TEMPERATURES SO THIS IS EVEN OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS- THE CLIMATE IS NOT HAPPY AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST MOST RESPONSIBLE TRANSITION AS WE CAN SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE IT- AND ALSO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS. RIGHTEOUS TO THE TO ALL RATEPAYERS ALSO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS- BUT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO CONTINUE TO FIND THOSE IMPORTANT SOLUTIONS TO THIS PERPLEXING AND VEXING PROBLEM I'LL TURN TO- OUR PANELISTS AGAIN I'M- COURTESY IF YOU HAVE- THIRTY SECONDS A CLOSING COMMENT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE ME UP ON THAT BUT I CERTAINLY. WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY HAVING HEARD PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY. IN PASSAGE YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH US. MISTER CHAIRMAN- THIS IS MIRABEL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MR VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STATING THAT THIS ISN'T EASY AND IT ISN'T. BUT YOU HAVE OUR PLEDGE AT THE C. P. U. C. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FROM I. SO ALLIES SO AND FROM THE CDC WOULD AGREE THAT. WE- I THINK THAT CHAIR HOCHSCHULE SAID THAT IS ONE TWO AND THREE IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN ALL OF OUR- TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF WORKEVERY DAY HOW- HOW ABSOLUTELY CONCENTRATED WE ARE AND DEVOTED WE ARE. TO MAKING SURE THAT- WE DO MEET THE RELIABILITY NEEDS OF THE STATE BUT WE DO IT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. THAT IT DOESN'T BREAK THE BACKS OF THE RATE PAYERS IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AT ALL TIMES. SO YOU YOU REALLY CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER YOU MUST SO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE PRIVILEGE TO. BE A PART OF THIS HEARING TODAY AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AT THE C. P. U. C. I. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HOLDEN AND- MEMBERS- I WOULD JUST WHAT YOU HAD TO WHAT- PRESENT THAT YOU JUST SAID THERE AND MY ONLY POINT WOULD BE. THAT THE MOMENT WE'RE IN REALLY REQUIRES US TO DO. TWO THINGS WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS THAT WERE INTO WHETHER THEY WERE FACING- AND THEN FOCUS ON ON THE RESILIENCE OF TRYING TO BUILD BUT ALSO TO THE UNDERLYING ISSUE WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT EITHER BECAUSE AS BAD AS THIS IS IT COULD GET A LOT WORSE. IF WE DON'T GET A HANDLE ON CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP. ON BUILDING A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE MATTERS MORE THAN EVER ANDI WOULD JUST- REMINDED WHEN YOU KNOW THE SOLUTIONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SOLAR WINDS ELECTRIC VEHICLES BATTERY STORAGE THESE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE BORN IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SCALING AROUND THE COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE- OF YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES AND- THIS GOVERNOR PREVIOUS GOVERNORS AND WE HAVE TO KEEP KEEP GOING. TO PERFORM THE CHILDREN GET TO SCALE- SO THAT WE CAN BETTER PROTECT OUR STATE. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. MANSER YOU'RE YOU'RE ON MUTE. CHARLES AN INVESTOR PATTERSON MEMBERS NOT MUCH MORE TO BE SET UP AND VOTE FOR PRESIDENT PATRICK CHAIR WHO SHELLED. OF THE PREGNANT VERY WELL I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I THINK THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE JUST GOT DISCUSS TODAY. AROUND COMMITMENT AND FOCUS AND PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION THAT IF WE PRACTICE THOSE. ON A REGULAR BASIS KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL MAINTAIN OUR FOCUS- THAT I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY PROMISING FUTURE ON THIS PATH TO DECARBONISATION FROM ALL OF US AT THE AYE SO WE REALLY VALUE PARTNERSHIPS. COLLABORATION AND THANK YOU CHARLTON AS WELL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND KEEP MYSELF FOCUSED IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY FOR TODAY. AND THAT CONCLUDES THIS HEARING.
