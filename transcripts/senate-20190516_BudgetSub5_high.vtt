THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED

OVER OVER THE PROLONGED POWER

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:10.275

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:12.811
VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES TO COME

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:13.545

AND WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST

BATHS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE.

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:35.033
SO THE VERY STATE AGENCIES WHO

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.502
DON'T HAVE THAT BACKUP POWER

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.572

DURING ANY TYPE OF SHUTDOWNS ONE

00:20:43.175 --> 00:20:44.443
EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD IS THE STATE

00:20:44.509 --> 00:20:45.844
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS

THOSE AREAS IT COULD LEAD -- TO

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:01.893
A LOT OF FOOD GOING BAD AND THE

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.732

IN THE STAFF REPORT SHOWS YOU'VE

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.107

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:17.175
WELL FIRST.

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.311
IT'S LEGITIMATE FOR GIVEN WHAT

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:20.679
WE'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR WITH

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:21.980
THE FIRES AND KNOWING THAT THERE

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.782
IS BEEN SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:27.185
OUR POWER LINES.

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.588
THAT IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.957
PUBLIC SAFETY TWO AT TIMES THE

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.125

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:35.894
BAND -- IT SO THAT'S YOUR BIG

00:21:35.961 --> 00:21:36.728
KNOWLEDGE IN NOW AND THAT'S THE

00:21:36.795 --> 00:21:38.330
POINT OF THIS ITEM BUT I NOTE

THAT YOU INDICATE THAT.

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.967

POWER IF SUCH AN OUTAGE OCCURS

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.978
YOU MENTION VARIOUS OTHER THINGS

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.646
LIKE THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.114
GOVERNMENT STAFF PLANNING GRANTS

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:57.149

PREPAREDNESS WHICH MAY.

00:21:58.617 --> 00:22:00.285
REQUIRE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:03.055
TO IDENTIFY WHAT CRITICAL.

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:05.524
SERVICES THEY MAY BE OPERATING

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.626
THAT DON'T HAVE BACKUP POWER --

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:10.896
AND BE ABLE -- TO ADDRESS THAT

00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:13.732
AS WE GO FORWARD.

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.599
YOU MY SALE THAT.

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:15.534
BECAUSE IT'S ALL LISTED HERE BUT

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.603
THEN I NOTED YESTERDAY IN THE

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.507
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WHEN ASKED

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:23.709
THE QUESTION.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:24.743
THE ANSWER WAS THAT SEVENTY

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.244
MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS BACKUP

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:28.280
GENERATORS FOR STATE FACILITIES.

00:22:28.346 --> 00:22:30.816
AND ONLY FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL

00:22:30.882 --> 00:22:31.750
PLANTS.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:33.752
AND THAT SEEMED A BIT SKEWED TO

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:36.021
ME WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.355
DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:39.925
STATE FACILITIES HAVE BACKUP.

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:41.893
WE ALSO KNOW I MEAN ESPECIALLY

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.428
WHEN WE MENTION HERE.

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.430
THE ISSUE ABOUT LIFE SUSTAINING

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:46.531
EQUIPMENT.

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:47.933
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.735
OPERATE ON THERE OBVIOUSLY IN

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.737
PLACES OTHER THAN OUR FIRE

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:52.537
STATIONS.

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.706
SO IT JUST SEEMED A LITTLE

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:55.107
SKEWED [inaudible]

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.542
RESPONSE.

00:22:57.609 --> 00:22:58.810
A SERVICE TO THE ANSWER THERE SO

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:01.613
OUR PLANNING ASSUMPTION ON THE

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.014
LOCAL PLANNING GRANTS.

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:05.484
OF IN IS BUILDING OFF OF THE

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.185
LOCAL PLANNING CUT CONTINUE ON

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.487
THAT THEY HAVE FOR EMERGENCY

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:09.654
RESPONSE.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.690
SO THE GOAL OF THIS FUNDING WAS

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:12.891
TO PROVIDE.

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.459
GRANTS SO THAT THEY COULD

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:16.495
REVISIT THOSE EMERGENCY PLANS IN

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.863
THE LIGHT OF THESE EXTENDED

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:21.500
PROLONGED OUTAGES AND BE ABLE TO

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.068
CONVENE A MULTI.

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.036
THE FACETED STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.638
INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.607
THE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS --

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.509
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:32.043
ENSURING THAT THEY'RE WORKING

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.979
WITH LOCALLY WITH THEIR NON

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:36.047
GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:37.249
THEIR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER

00:23:37.315 --> 00:23:38.216
APPRECIATE THAT.

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:39.951
AND I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:41.453
SPOKE TO THAT NEED RIGHT WHEN

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.555
I'M RACING IS THAT I HAVE A B.

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:45.090
C. P. THAT HAS A LOT OF DETAIL.

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.758
OF A LOT OF NEEDS BUT THEN IN

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:50.629
THE ANSWER ATTY ASSEMBLY.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:50.862
BY WAS.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:51.630
HEARD.

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:53.231
AND SAW THE THE ANSWER WAS

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:54.166
SEVENTY MILLION WOULD GO TO THE

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.934
STATE FACILITIES AND ONLY FIVE

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:57.769
MILLION FOR THESE LOCAL NATURE

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:58.670
DESCRIBING SO IS THAT YOUR

00:23:58.737 --> 00:23:59.871
INTENTION.

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:01.873
A THAT WAS A PLANNING ASSUMPTION

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.875
THAT WENT INTO THE PART OF IT IS

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:05.243
SORT OF A WHY ALL THE LANGUAGE

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.378
AROUND ALL THESE OTHER NEEDS

00:24:06.444 --> 00:24:09.481
WHEN IN FACT REALLY THE MAJORITY

00:24:09.548 --> 00:24:10.582
DID NOT I MEAN THE MAJORITY I

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:13.185
MEAN THAT.

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:15.020
FINDING IS GOING TO GO FORWARD

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.221
THE STATE AGENCY I JUST THINK

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.023
IT'S A MORE ACCURATE DEPICTION

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:23.261
OF WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO

00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:24.863
APPROVE.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.631
WELL SO AS I MENTIONED BUILDING

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.400
ON WHAT THE LOCALS ARE ALREADY-DOING IN REGARD TO THEIR LOCAL

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:29.534
PLANNING THIS WAS A WAY TO HAVE

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.936
THEM ASSESS THAT AND BE ABLE TO

00:24:31.002 --> 00:24:33.371
TRAIN AND EXERCISE AND I GUESS

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:34.573
VALIDATE THOSE PLANNING

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:35.841
ASSUMPTIONS FOR THESE PROLONGED

00:24:35.907 --> 00:24:36.741
OUTAGES.

00:24:36.808 --> 00:24:38.276
AND THEN KNOWING THAT THE STATE

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:39.611
DEPARTMENT'S ON HOME THOSE LOCAL

00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:42.514
DEPEND -- FOR SUSTAINABLE

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:45.817

CAPABILITIES THERE ADDITIONAL

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.957
RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT THE

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:53.959
LOCALS SO -- KNOWING THAT SOME

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:55.126
OF THE CRITICAL THAT

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:56.661
INFRASTRUCTURE TO HARD IN THOSE

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:58.997
FACILITIES WILL COST MORE THAN

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:01.333
AND THEN AND THEN PERHAPS FROM

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.401
THOSE PLANNING FROM THAT.

00:25:03.468 --> 00:25:05.003
THOSE LOCAL EFFORTS SEEING WHAT

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.271
COMES OUT OF THOSE -- THOSE

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:09.708
REGIONAL EFFORTS TRAINING AND

EXERCISES FAR AS WHAT'S NEEDED --

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.045
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:16.781
CENTER MOORLACH I THINK I JUST

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:17.349
WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT

IS THAT A GRANT IS IT ALONE YEAH.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.492
SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE A

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.660
MODEL THAT WE USE UNDER OUR

FLEXIBILITY -- WE ALSO.

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:34.092
THE AGENDA NOTES THAT VISUAL

00:26:34.159 --> 00:26:35.760
LANGUAGE LANGUAGE WILL BE ADDED

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:36.895
TO REPORT BACK TO THE

SUBCOMMITTEE -- SO.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.101
WELL THERE ISN'T MUCH QUIRK

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:46.538
CLARITY RIGHT NOW IN MUCH DETAIL --

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:49.074
WORK REALLY AND EXTRAORDINARY

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.311
TIMES WITH -- THESE IDEAS ABOUT

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:58.917
US YES WE ARE TIED TO IT.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:00.218
I THINK A REALLY RAISING IS THAT

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.419
I HAVEN'T I HVE MATERIAL FROM

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:02.320
THE ADMINISTRATION THAT

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:04.022
DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF VERY

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:06.691
IMPORTANT PURPOSES. FOR SEVENTY

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:08.226
FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ASK BUT WHEN

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.795
DRILL DOWN WE FIND THAT. SEVENTY

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:12.597
MILLION OF IT GOES TO ONE OF THE

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:14.232
DESCRIBED THIS IS AN ONLY FIVE

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:16.234
MILLION TO A WHOLE NUMBER OF

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.837
OTHER DESCRIBED PURPOSES SO THAT

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:20.805
IS REALLY THE ISSUE FOR ME.

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:24.309
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT.

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:25.243
IT.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.945
THAT THE STATE DOESN'T NEED THE

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:28.213
SEVENTY MILLION FOR OUR STATE

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.614
FACILITIES IT'S MORE THAT.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.116
HOW DO I EVALUATE WHAT YOU

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.384
REALLY HAVE IN MIND WHEN I'M

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.652
BEING GIVEN A LOT OF RATIONALE

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:35.787
FOR AN EXPENDITURE BUT THEN I

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.589
FIND OUT THAT REALLY THAT

00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:39.557
RATIONAL ONLY APPLIES?

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.226
TO THIS MUCH OF THE EXPENDITURE

00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:43.128
AND THE OTHER RATIONALE.

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:45.530
APPLIES TO THAT MUCH.

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:47.365
GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR I JUST LIKE

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.333
IT MAYBE CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.567
FURTHER WE WE SPOKE WITH THE

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:50.902
DIRECTIONAL AFTER AT THE

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:52.303
ASSEMBLY HEARING AND WE'VE HAD

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.805
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AT WITHIN

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:56.074
THE MINISTRATION I JUST WOULD

00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:57.042
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT.

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:58.443
WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS KIND OF

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.378
INFORMATION GATHERING AND THE

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:02.647
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FIGURE

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.449
IS KIND OF A AN ATTEMPTED

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:05.016
ASSESSING.

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:06.584
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE CROSSED

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:09.487
PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.688
EIGHT WITHIN THE STATE SO THAT

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.323
THE I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE'RE

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.224
AT A POINT HOLDEN NOT PUBLIC

00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.794
SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE UP AND

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.161
DOWN THE STATE?

00:28:16.227 --> 00:28:17.562
STATE.

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.597
FACILITIES YES STATE STATE

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:20.832
INSTITUTIONS STATE FACILITIES.

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.400
WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN NEEDS

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:23.334
THERE?

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:24.469
I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT A POINT

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.805
NOW WE'RE SAYING THAT OF THE

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:27.572
SEVENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.908
SPEND SEVENTY OF IT ON THAT.

00:28:29.974 --> 00:28:31.109
I THINK WE'RE STILL IN THE

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.977
PROCESS OF DOING IS IDENTIFYING

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:34.779
WHERE ALL THE GAPS IN NEEDS ARE

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.181
AND THE INITIAL GRANTS THAT GO

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.682
TO THE COUNTIES WE'LL BE

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:39.451
TOGETHER SIMILAR INFORMATION

00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:41.252
FROM THEIR SIDE.

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.387
THE IDEA WITH THE PROVISIONAL

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:45.256
LANGUAGE IS TO HAVE A FLEXIBLE

00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.958
PART OF MONEY SO THAT.

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.426
AS THESE EVENTS START HAPPENING

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.628
AND WE KNOW WHICH REGIONS ARE

00:28:50.695 --> 00:28:52.931
GOING TO BE HIT THE HEAVIEST AND

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:55.800
WHAT -- GAPS ARE KIND OF THE

00:28:55.867 --> 00:28:56.734
MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE CAN

00:28:56.801 --> 00:29:01.072
INVEST IN IN THOSE GAPS.

00:29:01.139 --> 00:29:01.673
AND THAT WILL BE A MIX I THINK

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.942
OF BOTH STATE AND LOCAL OF

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:05.009
PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE I

00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.611
JUST I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:10.615
GOING OFF OF EARLY INFORMATION

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:12.350
YAK IS IS WE MENTIONED THAT THIS

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:13.718
IS SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.487
SOMEWHAT NEW AND EVOLVING AND

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:17.021
WE'RE TRYING TO GATHER RELEVANT.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:18.490
INFORMATION SO WE KNOW THE

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.258
BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR OWN

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:22.293
ABILITIES -- AND I THINK THE

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:22.794
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:24.496

THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW.

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:38.176
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:40.311
DEFINITIVELY THE SPLIT IS GOING

00:29:40.378 --> 00:29:41.679
TO BE SEVENTY AND FIVE I THINK

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.748

ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE BELIEVE

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.465
THAT THIS IN CONCERT DEFINITELY

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:42.166
MAKES SENSE -- CERTAINLY THERE

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.468
ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.203
SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO POWER

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.405
SHUT OFFS -- HOWEVER WE BROUGHT

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.573
UP I'D JUST SOME KIND SOME

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.475
GENERAL -- COMMENTS ABOUT THE

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:51.876
LACK OF CLARITY ON THE THE

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:55.446
SPECIFIC USES OF THE FUNDS AND

00:31:55.513 --> 00:31:56.547
ALSO HOW ARE WE AS WE COORDINATE

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.149
WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.450
WHO MIGHT BE DOING.

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:00.518
SOME ACTIVITIES ALSO AROUND

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.987
POWER SHUT OFF AND SO WE'D SAID

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.555
THAT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:06.924
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PURSUE THIS --

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.260
APPROACH IN THIS GENERAL CONCEPT --

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:10.995
A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT

00:32:11.062 --> 00:32:11.663
COULD THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:13.364
CONSIDER -- ONE OF THOSE IS

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.299
BUDGET BILLING WHICH THAT WOULD

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:15.767
PRIORITIZE THE USE OF THOSE

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:16.467
FUNDS ARE FOR EXAMPLE OF THE

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:17.902
LEGISLATURE WANTS A CERTAIN

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.737
PERCENTAGE TO GO TO LOCALS

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.506
VERSES -- THE STATE THAT COULD

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.408
BE PROVIDED AS PART OF THE

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:24.008
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.943
APPROVED -- YOU COULD PROVIDE

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.312
THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A MORE

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:30.014
LIMITED DURATION JUST NINETEEN

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:30.581
TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE WITH SOME

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:31.816
REPORTING BACK ON THEN YOU'D

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.017
HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THAT MONEY

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:34.986
IS -- EXPECTED TO GO OUT AND AND

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.854
IS ACTUALLY GOING OUT BEFORE

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.123
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING --

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.058
OR YOU COULD MAKE THE FUNDING --

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:41.859
AVAILABLE PROVISIONALLY BASED ON

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.061
THE SUBMISSION OF A MORE

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.429
DETAILED REPORTS OF THOSE ARE A

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:45.797
FEW OPTIONS THAT WE LAY OUT --

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:47.098
NOT NECESSARILY MUTUALLY

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.633
EXCLUSIVE BUT WE DO THINK IS A

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.734
REALLY IMPORTANT PURPOSE IT'S

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:50.702
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.804
THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- OVERSIGHT

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.372
AND THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:32:54.439 --> 00:33:00.712
PROVIDES ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:01.312
THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE THOSE

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:07.051
DECISIONS.

00:33:07.118 --> 00:33:09.554
YES I AM A I AM SOMEWHAT

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.956
STRUGGLING WITH THE THE MOTION I

00:33:12.023 --> 00:33:16.928
WOULD LIKE -- TO BECAUSE THIS.

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:18.563
FIVE I TOTALLY SEE THE NEED.

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:19.997
AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE DON'T

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:21.699
FULLY HAVE THE INFO YET AND THE

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.701
PART OF ACTING ON THIS IS IT

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:27.305
WILL ALLOW -- YES TO GET SOME OF

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:29.741
THE INFO IT'S JUST HARD TO SAY

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.709
YES TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:33.378
WITHOUT REALLY HAVING

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.279
UNDERSTANDING YET OF HOW I MEAN

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:36.881
THERE COULD BE THAT.

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:39.217
POTENTIALLY THAT OUR OWN STATE

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:42.653
OFFICES NEED MORE THAN THAT FOR

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.289
THIS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH --

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:49.293
BACKUP POWER OR MAYBE A LOT LESS --

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.996
YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW -- SO RIGHT

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.765
NOW THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION

00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:55.299
WOULD BE PLACE HOLDER BUDGET

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:56.901
APPROVING WITH PLACE HOLDER

00:33:56.968 --> 00:33:58.169
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:01.839
REPORTING USES OF THE FUNDING --

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:03.040
THAT WOULD INFORMACIóN HOURS

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:04.876
USED BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.677
PUT IN [inaudible]

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:10.248
THE CONTINGENCY OF SOME OF ALL

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:12.350
OF FUNDING BASED ON THE

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:17.288
SUBMISSION OF MORE DETAIL -- I

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:17.822

BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IS COLLECTING

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.483
INFORMATION SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.351
