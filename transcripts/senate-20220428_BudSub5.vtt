THAT I'M SENSING RIGHT NOW IS

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:19.110

DON'T HAVE BACK ISSUES HI AM NOT

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.011
A NINETEEN VOTE I'M PERSONS ARE

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:57.281
AT AS FAR AS WHAT'S- AND DURING

00:36:57.348 --> 00:37:05.856

WHICH OKAY MISS MONTGOMERY. SO

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.637
THE QUESTION THAT I'M HEARING IS

00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:22.173
THE THREE DAY IN PERSON VISITING

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.942
VERSUS VIDEO VISITING- NOT NOT

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:27.678
NOT VERSES BUT OKAY IN ADDITION

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.747
IN ADDITION THIS IS THIS IS WHAT

00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:30.715
I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.950
SUPPOSED TO BE THREE DAYS OF IN

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:36.187
PERSON VISITING. PROVIDED OKAY-

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:41.225
SO. AGAIN THAT'S NOT MY PROGRAM

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:44.028
I YOU KNOW AFTER. REFER TO TODAY

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:46.364
ON- IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.365
THREE DAYS OF IN PERSON

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.967
VISITING- AND NOT THE VIDEO

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.802
VISITING. IT FOR IMPLEMENTING

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:52.470
MATTER IF IT'S MAINLY BECAUSE OF

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.905
OUR WE'RE SHARING THE ROOMS

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:57.642
BETWEEN. AND I APOLOGIZE AND SO

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.709
I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.611
MORE VIDEO VISITING AND I

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:01.579
APOLOGIZE FOR IT SO THE REASON

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.381
THE REASON IS THAT WE USE THE

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.516
SAME AREAS SO WE'RE VIDEO

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:09.086
VISITING WERE ALSO USING- THAT

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:11.222
IS OCCURS IN THE SAME ROOM AS

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:13.557
THE- IN PERSON BUSINESS. AND SO

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.326
IT TAKES THE COMPUTERS AND ALL

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.428
THAT STUFF TAKES UP SPACE- FOR

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:20.898
US TO CONDUCT IN PERSON MEETING

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:27.505
WITH A VISITING. OKAY WELL. MY

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:28.773
UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S NOT

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:31.876
SUPPOSED TO SUBSTITUTE I

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:32.376
UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.178
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY BE

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:36.180
MORE CONVENIENT FOR SOME BUT

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.448
FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.684
GOTTEN AND WHAT WE'VE OF

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.619
COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.921
THIS IS NOT THE IN PERSON

00:38:43.988 --> 00:38:46.924
VISITING IS NOT OR THE REMOTE

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.726
VIDEO REMOTE IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:52.296
FOR THE IN PERSON AND SO I THINK

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:54.331
WE KEEP I KEEP HEARING FROM YOU

00:38:54.398 --> 00:38:56.600
IS HOW SUCCESSFUL THE VIDEO

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.602
CONFERENCING- VIDEO VISITING IN

THAT ARE TECHNICAL AND NON CROP

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.415
CONTROVERSIAL IN NATURE- AND SO

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:46.249
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:48.184

TRULY- TECHNICAL AND NON

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.164
CONTROVERSIAL IN NATURE FOR

00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:03.066
EXAMPLE. THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.969
CONSIDER- EXCLUDING PROJECTS AT

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:07.971
PRISONS GIVEN THE CONCERNS THAT

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.806
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THIS

00:55:09.873 --> 00:55:12.175
COMMITTEE AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT-

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.810

POPULATION AND POTENTIAL FUTURE

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:23.286
PRISON CLOSURES- IT COULD ALSO-

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:25.989
EXCLUDE. AT LEAST REVENUE BOND

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.090
PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF

DEPARTMENT THAT ARE OVER A

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:29.626
CERTAIN DOLLAR THRESHOLDS THAT

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.695
WOULD JUSTIFY GIVEN THE SCALE OF

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:34.864
THE PROJECT- INCREASED OVERSIGHT

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:37.600
FOR EXAMPLE- AND THEN THE SECOND

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:38.568
AREA TO CONSIDER WOULD BE

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:41.971
TIMING- SO. IT'S IN SPECIFICALLY

00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:43.306
IT IT TENDS TO BE MORE DIFFICULT

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:44.374
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.309

CODE COMMITTEE IS IT WAS CREATED

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.978
BY THE LEGISLATURE AND- IT'S

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:50.413
BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE JANUARY

TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE MANDATE

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.448
TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO

UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION AND

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:02.091
IMPROVING JUSTICE MEDICALLY

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:03.492
CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL LEGAL

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:05.428
SYSTEM WE'VE PUT OUT TOO MANY

01:06:05.494 --> 01:06:06.729
RECORDS SO FAR IN OUR MOST

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:07.897
RECENT ONE WE RECOMMENDED

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:11.033
EXPANDING THE MCRPC CTRP

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.168
PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:13.969
THIS AFTERNOON- AS YOU HEARD

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:15.171
THESE ARE EXISTING PROGRAMS AT

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.039
CDC ARE RUNS THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:18.441
TO SPEND THE LAST MONTHS OF

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:23.479
THEIR INCARCERATION IN. A

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:24.447
SECURED SETTING IN THE

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.648
COMMUNITY. THE REASON MANY WAS.

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.950
TO THIS I WAS BIG THE RE THAT-

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.085
MISTER- SPOKE ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.253
I WON A- THE- A BIT- THERE IS

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.054
RESEARCH FROM THE STANFORD

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.357
PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM THAT- WAS

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.758
ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.793
CAUSATION WAS ABLE TO. IDENTIFY

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:39.662
A CONTROL GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO.

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:41.330
COULD HAVE GONE INTO AN M. C. R.

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:42.932
P. PROGRAM BUT DIDN'T FOR

01:06:42.998 --> 01:06:44.166
REASONS BEYOND THEIR CONTROL AND

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:45.368
THOSE WHO DID COMPLETE THE

01:06:45.434 --> 01:06:46.736
PROGRAM SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:49.338
TO ISOLATE AND SAY. THE M. C. R.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:50.172
P. HAVE THE HAVE AN EFFECT ON

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.507
REDUCING RECIDIVISM THEY

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.242
CONCLUDED THAT THAT YES IT DID.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.610
AND YOU KNOW THE STUDY LOOKED AT

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:55.811
MOE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.848
PEOPLE WHO WERE RELEASED BETWEEN

01:06:58.914 --> 01:06:59.849
SEPTEMBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN IN

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:01.117
JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN SO IT'S

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.585
RECENT THAT EXTREMELY RELEVANT

01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:04.487
TO THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY. WHAT

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:05.888
THE RESEARCHERS FOUND WAS THAT

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.656
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED. NINE

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:09.892
MONTHS AND M. C. R. P. HAD THAT

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.227
92% REDUCTION IN THE

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:12.762
RECONNECTION RIGHT THAT MR BOND

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:14.463
MENTIONS THAT SO. THAT'S A BIG

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.198
REDUCTION. THEY ALSO FOUND

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:17.466
SIMILAR REDUCTIONS IN THE RE

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.135
ARREST RATES SO THE FIRST

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:20.569
PACIFISTIC WITH PEOPLE.

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.104
CONVICTED OF NEW OFFENSES AND

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.372
THE SECOND ONE IS ABOUT PEOPLE

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.508
WHO ARE ARE REARRESTED. AND THEY

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.877
FOUND A 20% REDUCTION IN THE

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.779
REARREST RATE COMPARED TO THE

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:31.580
CONTROL GROUP FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:33.015
DONE AT LEAST SEVEN MONTHS AND

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:35.551
MCRPC- SO. THESE ARE AS I SAID

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:36.352
THESE RESULTS ARE VERY STRIKING

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.988
AND- ARE YOU KNOW IT'S RARE TO

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:42.858
FIND A STUDY OF AN EXACT PROGRAM

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:44.560
THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO EXPAND

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:45.694
SELECT COMMITTEE- WAS

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:46.495
PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED BY THE

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:47.296
ASSEMBLY. RENDITION OF THIS OVER

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.131
A FEW OTHER THINGS THE COMMITTEE

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:49.965
CONSIDERED- THE RECONNECTION

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:51.467
RATE FOR WOMEN WHO GO THROUGH

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.302
THE C. C. T. R. P. PROGRAM AND-

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:55.304
YOU KNOW THE ACRONYMS ARE. FAST

01:07:55.371 --> 01:07:56.338
AND HEAVY IN THIS WORLD AS WE

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.307
KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PROGRAM

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.842
THAT. SERVES WOMEN IN

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:00.576
PARTICULAR. THEY HAD A MUCH

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.111
LOWER REARREST RATE THAN THE

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:04.280
OVERALL REARREST RATES ALMOST.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.482
20% FOR C. C. T. R. P. VERSUS

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.651
35% OVERALL. AND THAT WAS IN THE

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.319
CONTROL GROUP STUDY LIKE THE

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:11.187
STANFORD STUDY BUT IT'S

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:12.421
CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FINDINGS

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:13.322
AND SUPPORTS THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.090
IMPACTS HERE. AND FINALLY THE

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:16.325
COMMITTEE ALWAYS LIKES TO LOOK

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:17.827
AT WHAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:19.361
DOING- AND TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.464
BE THINGS THAT CAN BE TRANSLATED

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.631
INTO THE CALIFORNIA CONTACTS.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.099
INDEED THERE IS A HELPFUL MODEL

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.568
HERE THAT'S THE FEDERAL BUREAU

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.369
OF PRISONS. WHICH NOW HAS MORE

01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:28.437
PEOPLE IN ITS PRISONS SOMETHING

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.005
WE DO. ALMOST EVERYONE RELEASED

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.207
FROM FEDERAL PRISON IS GONNA

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:32.908
SPEND UP TO THE LAST YEAR MAKES

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.144
SENSE- SIMILAR PROGRAM- SO AS

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:37.847
YOU AS YOU HEARD YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.414
RELEASING THIRTY THOUSAND.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.315
PEOPLE A YEAR FROM PRISON THAT'S

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.016
ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE A DAY MORE

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:42.384
THAN EIGHTY PEOPLE A DAY. WE

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.419
HAVE LESS THAN A THOUSAND OF

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.721
THESE BEDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE-

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.923
AND SO BASED ON THAT DATA

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.524
RESEARCH THE PENAL CODE

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.692
COMMITTEE CONCLUDED. THERE WOULD

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:51.527
BE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:52.661
PUBLIC SAFETY AND OTHER POSITIVE

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:55.030

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:40.462
OF THE- SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IS-

WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THIS

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:11.153
PROGRAM IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.121
BE THINKING ABOUT IT WHAT WHAT

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.322

FORWARD AS IT COMMITTEE- TO

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.928
POSSIBLY ALLOCATING FUNDS TO DO

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.130
THAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:22.498
FOR TO GET TO SOMETHING

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.267
REALISTIC THAT STRESS TO-

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.169
REPLICATE EXPAND THIS VERY

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:31.039
PROMISING MODEL. THAT'S A GOOD

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:33.408
QUESTION I CAN. TRY TO ANSWER

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:35.077
THAT SO THE PER CAPITA COST FOR

01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.012
US TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT WE

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:39.481
JUST ALL A COSTS TYPICALLY.

01:13:39.548 --> 01:13:41.950
RANGES FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:43.352
FIFTY TO A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE

01:13:43.418 --> 01:13:45.454
DAY THE PER CAPITA COSTS ON A

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:48.924
FOUR CAR STREET XIN I BELIEVE IS

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:49.558
AROUND TWO HUNDRED NINETY- DAYS

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.093
SO. EITHER CERTAINLY COST

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.494
SAVINGS THERE BUT YOU ALSO GET

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.096
COST SAVINGS ON THE COST

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:56.298
REDUCTION FROM RE CONVICTION

01:13:56.365 --> 01:13:58.300
WHICH IS ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND

01:13:58.367 --> 01:13:59.835
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

01:13:59.902 --> 01:14:01.637
RECONNECTION. THE DENSER THAT'S

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:04.673
OCCURRING SO TO THE EXTENT. IT I

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:05.474
THINK I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:08.010
YOUR- DESCRIPTION THESE ARE DEAF

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:08.577
TO REASON OTHERWISE YOU'RE

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.913
YOU'RE PURCHASING FACILITIES IN

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:12.514
COMMUNITIES SO I ASSUME THAT'S A

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.783
SEPARATE COST MISTER BOND- ON ON

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:19.087
TOP OF. THE YOU KNOW THE DAILY

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.389
PER CAPITA EXPENSE. SO THOSE ARE

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.224
ACTUALLY THE ALL IN COST PAYS

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.792
FOR THE COST OF THE FACILITY AS

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.728
WELL SO IF WE COULD WORK WITH

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:27.362
LANCE B. OR OTHER- PROPERTY

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:28.597
OWNERS SIDE OF LEASE OR PURCHASE

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:30.399
PROPERTY THAT THE PRICE THAT I

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:31.400
MENTION FOR OUR SERVICES

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:32.968
ACTUALLY INCLUDES THE COST OF

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:35.771
EITHER LEAVES SCENE. OR IT

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.240
TYPICALLY LEASING OR PURCHASING

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.209
A PROPERTY. BUT SEARCHING CHAU

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.010
IS AND THEN IN TERMS OF.

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:44.980
PROSPECTIVE CAPACITY BUILDING

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:45.747
WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. YOU

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.083
KNOW WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS ON

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.218
HOW FAST. WE COULD EXPAND THIS

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.086
PROGRAM TO GET TO SOMETHING.

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.288
LIKE THE NUMBER THAT I THINK I

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:54.456
THINK MR OFTEN DESCRIBE A THIRTY

01:14:54.523 --> 01:14:58.360
THOUSAND- IN MY TWO YEAR YOU

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.561
KNOW SO HOPEFULLY MOVING THROUGH

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.496
THIS PROCESS. I WOULD SAY OUR

01:15:01.563 --> 01:15:04.032
ABILITY TO REALLY IDENTIFY- RAMP

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:06.368
UP PURCHASED OR LEASED NEW SITES

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:07.369
AND THEN TRAINED WORK FORCE AND

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:10.005
SO I WOULD BELIEVE THAT. WHAT IS

01:15:10.072 --> 01:15:11.807
BEING PROPOSED AS A REALISTIC-

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.409
RAMP TO THAT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.812
WANT TO ADD TOM ANYTHING TO THAT

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:17.679
IN TERMS OF TIME LINES BUT WE

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:19.815
BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE ABLE TO RAMP

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.018
UP. THERE BEFORE ME PROVIDERS

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:24.620
THAT DO THIS SERVICE AND OTHERS

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:27.422
THAT COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THIS

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.424
WELL TO DO IT. I'M NOT SURE

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:32.194
KEVIN THEIR ONLINE SEVENTY. YOU

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:33.729
KNOW I THINK THE ONLY THING I

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.597
WOULD I WOULD ADD IS- YOU KNOW

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:36.765
IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WE WERE

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.367
ABLE TO DOUBLE OUR PRISON

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.768
CAPACITY IN ABOUT TEN YEARS SO I

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.336
THINK WE'VE SHOWN THAT WE CAN

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.571
MAKE THE KIND OF INVESTMENT IN

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.606
THE SYRIAN HOPEFULLY IN A- IN A

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.141
WAY THAT- IS LITTLE MORE CITIES

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.542
A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THAT WAS

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.478
SOMETHING ELSE OF THE PENAL CODE

01:15:49.544 --> 01:15:51.246
COMMITTEE CONSIDERED IN MAKING

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.849

01:15:54.983 --> 01:15:56.518
THINGS WE FIND THAT CAN BE

01:15:56.585 --> 01:16:00.389
DIFFICULT IT'S CITING. PROGRAMS-

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.925
INDIA'S AND OF COURSE- THAT CAN

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:05.861
BE AN ISSUE BUT- SO FAR WE'VE

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.329
BEEN PRETTY LUCKY WITH THE

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.264
SCIENCE THAT WE HAVE AND I'VE

GOING TO OFFER A TWENTY- ARSENIC

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:37.292
VISUAL INFORMATION ON THE PER

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.394
CAPITA COST AND YOUR QUESTION

01:16:39.461 --> 01:16:42.531
SENATOR NEWMAN- WHILE IT IS TRUE

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.566
THAT THE DAILY COST TO HAVE THE

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:47.035
AVERAGE COST TO HOUSE A PERSON

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:49.504
IN A STATE OPERATED PRISON-

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:52.975
COMES OUT TO AROUND. TWO HUNDRED

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.643
SEVENTY DOLLARS A DAY AT THE

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.611
CURRENT AVERAGE COST OF AROUND A

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.847
HUNDRED THOUSAND- DOLLARS A YEAR

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.148
WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.717
RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE POPULATION

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:02.951
BEING PARTICULARLY LOW DUE TO

01:17:03.018 --> 01:17:06.521
KOBE- I JUST. WANTED TO KNOW

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:09.358
THAT- DEAD COST OF THE STATE

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:11.560
ACTUALLY SAVES ONE IT. NO LONGER

01:17:11.626 --> 01:17:13.161
HOUSES A PERSON IN A STATE

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:16.565
OPERATED PRISON. IS CLOSER TO

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:18.100
THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY OR

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.634
THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR- THAT'S

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.436
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. THE STATE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.105
DOESN'T GET THE FIXED COST

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.706
SAVING ESSENTIALLY DOES.

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.241
SALARIES BEING THE BIG TICKET

NORTH DAKOTA WHERE WE'VE SHOWN-

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:36.891
BOTH PAROLE SUPERVISION

POPULATIONS OF PROBATION AS WELL

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.629
AS FACILITY POPULATIONS- AND

01:26:41.696 --> 01:26:43.898
THAT LED TO- THAT THOSE INSIGHTS

OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY IN THAT

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.211
CASE- AND THAT WAS DRIVEN

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.613
DIRECTLY BY NOT ONLY THE DATA

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.648
BUT ALSO HAVING IT- TRANSPARENT

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:03.418
AND AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC-

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.919
SAYS OF THE PUBLIC. DASHBOARD

SIDE- WE ALSO BUILD- LINE

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:11.693
SETTLES TOOLS FOR. EARLY IN TO

01:27:11.759 --> 01:27:13.661
BETTER UNDER WHAT'S- WITH THE

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:16.397
PEOPLE THAT BASED. AND WE WILL

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:17.365
USE THAT IN MANY STATES

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:18.800
INCLUDING IDAHO NORTH DAKOTA

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.034
ETCETERA THERE'S A GREAT VIDEO

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.869
ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE INTERESTED-

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:23.137
ON YOU TOO BUT JUST ONE OF A FEW

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.340
WEEKS AGO ABOUT HOW IN IDAHO WE

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:29.110
WERE ABLE TO- ROUTE- EITHER-

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.378
RELEASED FROM SUPERVISION

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:31.879
ALTOGETHER OR REDUCE THE

01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:35.617
SUPERVISION LEVEL. OF 5% OF THE

01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:38.486
PEOPLE ON PAROLE JUST BE JUST

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:41.089
JUST BY- MANAGING THE DATA AS IN

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.457
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.092
ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE ALREADY BUT

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:46.594
IDAHO'S DATA SYSTEMS- WEREN'T

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.730
EQUIPPED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AND

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:50.965
SO WE AS RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:51.532
MAKE THAT HAPPEN- AND THEN

01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:53.167
THURSDAY IS LEADERSHIP TOOLS AND

01:27:53.234 --> 01:27:54.636
THAT'S YOU CENTER ON ONGOING

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:57.205
BASIS FOR- IN MOST CASES THEY DO

01:27:57.271 --> 01:27:59.273
YOU SEE LEADERSHIP TO SEE. IN

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:04.245
REAL TIME HOW THE REFORMS AND IN

01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:05.046
MANY CASES CHANGES THEY'RE

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.815
MAKING- AFFECTS THEIR

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:15.523
POPULATIONS- NOT ON A- ANNUAL OR

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.791
QUARTERLY. BUT ACTUALLY ON A

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:19.360
WEEKLY BASIS IN REAL TIME. OKAY

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:21.095
AND COULD HOW LONG YOU BEEN TO

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.631
THIS WHAT WHAT IS THE- WHEN DID

01:28:23.698 --> 01:28:26.000
YOU COME UP WITH THIS IDEA- SO

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.368
WE'VE BEEN AROUND AS AN

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:28.536
ORGANIZATION FOR A LITTLE BIT

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:31.406
OVER THREE YEARS. WE STARTED AS

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:33.808
A WHAT'S CALLED A 20% PROJECT IN

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:37.011
GOOGLE- SO OUR FOUNDERS ARE.

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:40.148
FORMER GOOGLE- AND TECHNOLOGISTS

01:28:40.214 --> 01:28:42.417
AND- AND THEN EMERGE OUT OF

01:28:42.483 --> 01:28:44.385
GOOGLE I OR THE ORIGINS BECOME

01:28:44.452 --> 01:28:45.987
KIND OF BEFORE THOSE THREE OUT

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.321
HERE THIRTY THREE SHARES- BUT

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:50.958
WE'VE BEEN A NONPROFIT FOR ABOUT

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.527
THAT MUCH TIME. YOU KNOW- WHEN I

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:53.995
WAS READING ABOUT THIS IT. KIND

01:28:54.062 --> 01:28:55.363
OF REMINDED ME I DON'T KNOW IF

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.965
THIS IS CORRECT- TO MAKE THIS

01:28:58.032 --> 01:29:00.535
CONNECTION BUT WHAT WAS THAT OF

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:03.204
BASEBALL MONEYBALL. IT IS THIS

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.073
IS THIS KIND OF LIKE ALONG THOSE

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:09.444
LINES OR OR MY TOTALLY OFF. AS

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.312
IT'S A GOOD PARALLEL ACTUALLY SO

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.881
IT IN BUSINESS ELEMENTS OF

01:29:13.948 --> 01:29:15.149
SOFTWARE ENGINEERING THAT GOES

01:29:15.216 --> 01:29:16.617
IN INTO THIS AND THEN THERE'S AN

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:18.319
ELEMENT OF DATA SCIENCE. AND

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:19.987
CERTAINLY ON THE DESIGN SIDE IT

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.956
CAN FEEL LIKE MONEYBALL IN THAT-

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:24.892
WE CAN JUST BETTER UNDERSTANDS.

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.427
WHAT THE DATA MEANS WHAT THE

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:28.429
NUMBERS MEAN- IN REAL TIME BUT

01:29:28.496 --> 01:29:30.331
ALSO PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:33.067
AND SOME MONEYWHILE YOU'RE

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:33.601
SAYING. ESSENTIALLY DATA

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:36.337
PROJECTION WHICH WE ALSO DO. NOT

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:40.041
OKAY. OKAY I. CAN I CAN INCREASE

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.310
OF COURSE THANK YOU I- FIRST OF

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.445
ALL THE JUDGES ONE OF THE CHAIRS

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:46.280
MY LEAF ENDED. THE GERIATRIC

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:51.119
APPLIES TO PEOPLE OVER. AND ALSO

COOL WITH IT- BUT I AM CURIOUS

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:57.391
ABOUT THE UNIT YOU KNOW TO YOUR

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.293
ENGAGEMENT MODEL RIGHT SO DID IN

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.261
MY EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS STATE

01:30:00.328 --> 01:30:02.230
GOVERNMENT. WE'RE NOT AS GOOD

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:04.198
WITH DATA AS- I THINK WE'D LIKE

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.333
TO BE WHEN I WAS GOOD WITH

01:30:05.399 --> 01:30:07.535
TECHNOLOGY ON BOARDING AS WE

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.937
LIKE TO BE. SO YOU KNOW IT WENT

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:10.505
RECIDIVISTS IS ENGAGE WHAT

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.173
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP. HOW TO

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.342
HOW DOES IT WORK SO THAT YOU

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.376
KNOW THERE'S SOME INFO SURE

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:19.814
INSTEAD- PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING

01:30:19.881 --> 01:30:20.815
AT AND TRIPPING THE DATA WELL.

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:23.985
THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION-

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:24.919
TO. YEAH THERE THERE THERE'S TO

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.454
ENGAGE IN MODELS- BUT I THINK

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:28.556
ARE IMPORTANT HERE. WHAT IS OUR

01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:30.158
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE D. O. C.

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.392
THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS IN

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:33.594
THIS CASE CDCR- IS IMPORTANT

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:35.496
BECAUSE- THE FOUNDER LINE DATA

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:37.098
THAT FLOOD AS IF THAT. IS

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:38.633
NECESSARY FOR US TO DO REALLY

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.701
MEANINGFUL WORK- IS DATA THE CDC

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:44.038
ARE- HAS A HISTORICAL DATA- SO

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.540
BUT- I'M GLAD TO SAY WE HAVE A

01:30:45.606 --> 01:30:47.875
DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH CDCR

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:48.576
WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON A

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:50.344
NUMBER OF OTHER FRONTS- THAT.

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:54.415
THAT LINE STAFF TOOLS- TOOL THAT

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.817
I MENTIONED FOR PAROLE OFFICERS.

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:56.818
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:59.420
TALKING CDCR ABOUT- ROLLING OUT.

01:30:59.487 --> 01:31:01.189
SELLING BEST IN TERMS OF GETTING

01:31:01.255 --> 01:31:02.423
THE BEST THAT'S THE FIRST THE

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.292
STRIDES IT'S MAKING SURE WE HAVE

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:05.626
THE RIGHT DATA. THAT WE'RE-

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.261
SPEAKING WITH AND CONNECTING

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:09.130
WITH THEIR- RESEARCH AND

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:12.033
TECHNOLOGY TEAMS. ALL OF WHICH

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.268
IN CALIFORNIA ARE ARE LINING UP-

01:31:14.335 --> 01:31:15.736
AND THEN YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:18.706
THAT ON THE- LEGISLATURE SIDE.

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:20.474
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO HAVE

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.310
THE DATE OUT THERE BUT TO MAKE

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:23.377
SURE THAT IT'S EASILY

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.679
UNDERSTANDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE-

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:27.048
AND I AND AGAIN I WOULD

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:28.249
ENCOURAGE- I THINK. MY FAVORITE

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.750
THING TO SHOW FOLKS AND IF YOU

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.986
IF YOU WANT EVEN SCREEN SHARE-

01:31:32.053 --> 01:31:33.421
BUT BUT EVERYTHING IS TO YOU THE

01:31:33.487 --> 01:31:34.555
DASHBOARDS FOR. AGAIN

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.257
PENNSYLVANIA NORTH DAKOTA JUST.

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.926
GOOGLE RECIDIVISM. D. I. D. I.

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:41.629
Z. AT THE END- AND PENNSYLVANIA

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:43.598
YOU'LL SEE IT'S- AND YOU'LL SEE

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:45.366
HOW EASY IT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:47.501
DATA HOW YOU CAN CHANGE- THE

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:48.336
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS THAT YOU

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:50.471
WANT TO SEE. IN BEEN VERY SIMPLE

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.840
TO UNDERSTAND VISUALS- AND IN

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.342
ADDITION IF YOU GO TO OUR

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.543
WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE IF YOU CLICK

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.411
ON THE- ON POLICY. YOU'LL SEE

01:31:57.478 --> 01:31:59.380
THAT WE NOT ONLY JUST SHOW THE

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.917
DATA IN VISUALISATIONS. WE ALSO-

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:05.386
ENCAPSULATE THEM IN ONE PAGE

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:07.288
POLICY MEMOS. SO YOU'LL SEE ON

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.123
THAT LIST- ACTUALLY DID BEGIN TO

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.458
THE DATA SCIENCE MONEYBALL

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:12.526
QUESTION- YOU'LL SEE THAT WE

SUPERFICIAL POPULATION THE

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.103
SECOND IS A COMPONENT OF EACH

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.505
COUNTY'S MOST RECENT RETURN TO

01:37:24.572 --> 01:37:26.674
PRISON RATE AND A COMPARISON

PRIOR YEAR HI THIS IS A

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:31.178
COMPARISON OF YEAR TO YEAR DATA

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:31.679

DID IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THE

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:40.988
THIRD COMPONENT IS TO ESTABLISH

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:43.457
A FLOOR IT PROVIDES A MINIMUM OF

REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE. A CODE

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:50.331
NINETEEN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:51.232
AFFECTED THE FIRST TWO

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.400
COMPONENTS I TO GIVE A DETAILED

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.336
COMPARISON AND PERSPECTIVE OF

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.639
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE STATEWIDE-

01:37:58.706 --> 01:37:59.607

PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED TWELVE

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:15.689
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:16.490
HOWEVER DURING THE TWO TWENTY

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:18.259
YEAR. AND IN THE MIDST OF THAT

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:20.494
BUT- ONLY FRACTION THE KIND OF

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:21.462
STANDARD NUMBER OF IN. ON PRO

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:23.497
WERE RETURNED PRISON OUT BECAUSE

01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.399
OF THE PANDEMIC POLICIES IMPACTS

THE COURTS AND LOCAL LAW

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.636
ENFORCEMENT. AND HAD THE

01:38:28.702 --> 01:38:30.304
STATUTORY FORMULA REMAIN THE

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:31.972
SAME THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:33.274
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:34.441
MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED TO

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:36.343
COUNTIES FOR THESE PURPOSES-

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:37.378
WHICH IS WHY LAST YEAR THE

01:38:37.444 --> 01:38:38.912
ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE

01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:41.215

TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION FOR THE

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.788
GRANTS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.089
TWENTY TWO- THE AMOUNT WAS

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.824
DETERMINED FROM THE HIGHEST

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.559
LEVEL OF PAYMENT BY EACH COUNTY

THREE YEARS- AGAIN. THAT WAS

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.098
JUST A ONE YEAR POLICY THOUGH

01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.433
AND WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.701
PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.736
EXISTING FORMULA. OUR DATA SO

DIFFERENT COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:18.185
OR PRACTICES VERY CONSIDERABLY.

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:19.653
OUT WE ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE THESE

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:21.755
CHANGES BECAUSE OF COVERAGE-

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:23.424

TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:32.499
WHICH IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:33.967
CONTINUES TO PROPOSE THAT ONE

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:34.735
HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:35.836

TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:41.508
WE ANTICIPATE KIND OF THAT THE

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:43.844
LONG TAIL A LINGERING IMPACTS OF

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:44.511
THE PANDEMIC WILL. FULLY

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:46.847

AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:39:49.016 --> 01:39:54.088
THAT. THIS PROPOSAL IS TEMPORARY

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:55.589
. XIN IS COMMITTED T REVISING

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:56.657
FORMULA NEXT. AFTER THE FACT

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:59.293
DEPEND FOR NO. OF IN THE DATA I

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.260
ENSURE THAT THE- MAINTAINS THIS

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:01.295
OF THINGS. COUNTY FOR

MADAM CHAIR AND IT'LL BE PER

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:21.749
LINE A SENTENCE AGAIN OKAY. WE

01:40:21.815 --> 01:40:22.716
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:23.984
EXTENDED THE PROPOSED

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:26.820
MODIFICATION OF FORMULA ON A ONE

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.789
YEAR CASES AS OPPOSED TO THREE.

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.391
THE EXTENT ANY ADJUSTMENTS ARE

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:32.693
NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE THE

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.727
ADMINISTRATION COULD PROPOSE-

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.262
FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AS

01:40:35.329 --> 01:40:37.498
PART OF THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.166
FOUR BUDGET PROCESS. TWO MAIN

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:40.634
REASONS THAT ARE LEADING TO OUR

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.803
RECOMMENDATION. THAT FIRST IT IS

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.204
UNCLEAR WHY MODIFYING THE

01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:46.807
FORMULA FOR THREE YEARS IS

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:47.674
NECESSARY. GIVEN THAT THE FULL

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.710
SET OF INFORMATION IS NOT YET

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:52.312
AVAILABLE. RIGHT AND THEN SECOND

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:54.047
THE PROPOSED MODIFICATION COULD

01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:56.717
UNNECESSARILY UNDERMINE THE

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.919
INTENT OF SB SIX SEVENTY TWO

01:40:58.986 --> 01:40:59.787
AWARD COUNTIES BASED ON

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:02.055
PERFORMANCE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:03.424
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.926
GROUND MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:07.227
BUDGET YEAR. BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:07.294 --> 01:41:08.362
COULD CONSIDER SUCH SUGGESTIONS

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:11.331
AT THAT TIME WHEN IT. AND IT'LL

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:13.066
HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO DO SO

01:41:13.133 --> 01:41:15.569
YOU CAN I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:17.371
QUESTIONS. AS NEEDED. GREAT

THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SENATOR

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:23.343
NEWMAN. I GUESS JUST A REAL

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:26.413
QUICK QUESTION FOR ELLIE OF. I'M

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.815
SO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:29.283
ADJUSTMENTS TO OBJECT TO THE

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:31.351
FORM OF ID DO WE HAVE DATA ARE

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:32.453
THE COMPELLING SHOWS THAT THIS

01:41:32.519 --> 01:41:34.588
PROGRAM IS DOES IT WORK IS IT A

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:37.057
CHEATING ITS DESIRED EFFECT OVER

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:45.432
TIME. THIS IS TRUE SO TO WORK

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:46.934
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.070
OFFICE SO ON IT PRIOR TO THE

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.674
FORMULA BEING PAS- THEY DIDN'T

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.977
COLLECT DATA ON THE NUMBER OF.

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:58.612
PEOPLE WHO WERE ON COUNTY FELONY

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:00.380
SUPERVISION WHO WERE PREVENTED

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.749
FROM COMING TO THE STATE- AN

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:04.318
ESTIMATE OF THAT AMOUNT AND IT

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:05.953
DID SUGGEST THAT THERE WERE

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:07.955
PEOPLE WHO OF YOUR TO BE

01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:09.656
PREVENTED FROM COMING TO STATE

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.258
PRISON AS A RESULT OF THE

01:42:11.325 --> 01:42:12.392
PROGRAM. AND HAS THERE EVER BEEN

01:42:12.459 --> 01:42:14.928
ANY PROCESS ON A UNITS FOR THE

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:16.930
NOTE AND R. O. Y. SORT OF METRIC

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:19.766
TO SEE IF THIS IS BE MORE.

01:42:19.833 --> 01:42:22.936
IMPACTFUL ARE BETTER USE OF

01:42:23.003 --> 01:42:23.871
FUNDS AND OTHER APPROACHES. SO

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:26.473
THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS THE

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.741
WAY THEIR PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.743
DESIGNED WAS THAT IT WAS

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.079
INTENDED TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF

01:42:32.145 --> 01:42:34.181
THE STATE SAVINGS THAT OCCURS.

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.782
WHEN ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:37.985
PREVENTED FROM COMING FROM. A

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:39.920
STATE PRISON SO WHEN THIS WILL

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.288
THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:43.957
DEVELOPED THAT AMOUNT WAS TAGGED

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.325
AT ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:48.896
DOLLARS- COOL PER- FELONY

01:42:48.962 --> 01:42:50.497
PROBATION OR DIVERTED FROM STATE

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.299
PRISON. SINCE THEN AND SO AT

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:55.335
THAT POINT- IT WAS- RELATIVELY

01:42:55.402 --> 01:42:56.670
CLEAR THAT THE STATE WAS

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:58.872
ACHIEVING SOME SAVINGS. SINCE

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:01.275
THE PROGRAM HAS EVOLVED OVER

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:04.778
TIME TO HAVE DIFFERENT POTS. AND

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.747
ALSO BECAUSE STATE PRISON COSTS

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.081
HAVE CHANGED FROM WHEN THE

01:43:08.148 --> 01:43:10.584
PROGRAM WAS FIRST DONE. ON THAT.

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:12.853
DAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS CLEAR

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.622
AS TO HOW THE COST OF THE

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:21.194
PROGRAM COMPARES TO THE SAVINGS. BUT THAT'S SOMETHING CERTAINLY

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:22.963
WORTH EXPLORING. IF THAT DID NOT

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:26.767
DIED THANK YOU- YES N. M. FROM

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.168
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MISTER

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.771
ADELMAN COULD YOU. RESPOND TO

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:33.240
THESE ISSUES I KNOW AND IT'S

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:35.442
SOMEWHAT MADE REFERENCE IS HERE

01:43:35.509 --> 01:43:38.011
WE ARE GUARANTEEING OUR FUNDING

01:43:38.078 --> 01:43:39.780
WHEN IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:44.284
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE BASED SO

01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:46.820
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT.

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:48.722
AGAIN I THINK THE ISSUE AND

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:49.957
WHILE WE'RE GONE WE'RE PROPOSING

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.658
KIND OF THIS TEMPORARY FREEZE IS

01:43:51.725 --> 01:43:53.827
BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:55.829
DETERMINE IN THE MIDST OF THE

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:56.697
PANDEMIC WHICH COUNTIES ARE

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:58.599
ACTUALLY PERFORMING KIND OF DIS

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:00.300
INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAMS AND

01:44:00.367 --> 01:44:03.203
INITIATIVES. TO HAVE FEWER-

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:05.072
INDIVIDUALS RETURNED TO PRISON

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:06.974
OR IF THERE ARE OTHER KINDS

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.241
EXTERNAL FACTORS THAT ARE

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:10.243
REDUCING THEIR RETURN TO PRISON

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:12.012
RIGHT NOW IT'S COUNTIES- YOU

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:14.047
KNOW SOME COUNTIES HAD A MAKRAN

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:16.316
SHUTDOWNS IN OUR COURT SYSTEM

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:18.619
THROUGH- JANUARY- THERE IS A

01:44:18.685 --> 01:44:20.354
LIMITED INTAKE TO STATE PRISONS

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.689
THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWENTY

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:24.825
TWENTY ONE. ENDS AND SO WE'RE

01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:26.960
SEEING KIND OF THIS THIS NOISE

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:29.129
IN THE DATA THESE ARE OF WHAT

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:30.497
COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:32.532
ACTUALLY DOING PERFORMANCE WISE

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.001
AND SO SOME COUNTIES MIGHT HAVE

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.869
LOWER RETURN TO PRISON RATES

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:37.237
BECAUSE OF OTHER FACTORS SOME

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:39.106
COUNTIES MAY HAVE HIGHER RETURN

01:44:39.172 --> 01:44:40.340
TO PRISON RATES BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:44:40.407 --> 01:44:41.775
BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN KIND OF

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.777
PROSECUTING INDIVIDUALS. AND SO

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:45.579
IT'S JUST REALLY THE KIND OF

01:44:45.646 --> 01:44:47.347
STUFF STYLE WHAT IS A PROBATION

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:53.420
DEPARTMENT DOING VERSUS YOU.

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.022
KNOW KIND OF THESE OTHER

01:44:55.088 --> 01:44:59.192
FACTORS. MMHM OKAY- BUT DOES

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:00.594
THAT DO YOU HAVE SPECIFIC

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:03.263
INFORMATION THAT HAS TO DO WITH

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.631
BY ASKING FOR A THREE YEAR

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:07.000
EXTENSION VERSES ON A ONE YEAR

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:09.636
EXTENSION IF WE'RE IF WE'RE UP

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.304
IN THE AIR ABOUT THE ACTUAL

01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:13.407
INFORMATION HOW DOES THAT LEAD

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:15.776
O THREE YEARS INSTEAD OF ONE

01:45:15.842 --> 01:45:17.711
YEAR FOR ITS PART THE THREE OR

01:45:17.778 --> 01:45:19.379
FIVE THE REASON IF WE KIND OF

01:45:19.446 --> 01:45:21.114
CAME UP WITH THAT IS OBVIOUSLY

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:22.215
THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DATE IS

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.717
STILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:25.452
MORE KIND OF DIRECTED IMMEDIATE

01:45:25.519 --> 01:45:27.287
KOBE RESPONSES A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.122
HAS LINGERED INTO TWENTY TWENTY

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:30.457
TWO ALTHOUGH. THANKFULLY THINGS

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:32.192
DO SEEM TO BE OPENING UP ONE OF

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:33.660
THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:36.563
WANTED TO. KIND OF TAKE INTO

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:37.931
ACCOUNT THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:39.232
TWO DATA WITH IT THERE MIGHT BE

01:45:39.299 --> 01:45:41.435
SOME KIND OF COURT IMPACTS AS

01:45:41.501 --> 01:45:43.070
FAR AS BACKLOGS FOR CASES THAT

01:45:43.136 --> 01:45:44.905
HAVE KIND OF BEEN- DELAYED AND

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:46.440
DISPOSITIONS I DON'T HAVE

01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.141
SPECIFIC BY COUNTY DATA FOR THIS

01:45:48.208 --> 01:45:50.243
BUT WE HAVE HEARD KIND OF

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:51.945
ANECDOTALLY THAT HAVE. BEEN

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:54.114
SENDING REDUCE DISPOSITIONS

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.282
PARTICULAR ON THEIR FELONY

01:45:55.348 --> 01:45:57.350
CASELOADS I'M JUST BECAUSE OF

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.252
KIND OF GENERAL IMPACTS AND A

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:02.322
POTENTIAL BACKLOG- IN SO TO THE

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:03.990
EXTENT WE THOUGHT THAT THE

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.625
TWENTY TWENTY TO DATE WOULD CAN

01:46:05.692 --> 01:46:06.526
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE KIND

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:08.695
OF NOISY OR KIND OF EXTENUATING

01:46:08.762 --> 01:46:10.030
CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:11.732
THAT AND THEN THE REASON FOR THE

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:13.366
THIRD YEARS IS LARGELY BASED ON

01:46:13.433 --> 01:46:15.202
THE KIND OF YEAR TO YEAR

01:46:15.268 --> 01:46:16.837
COMPARISON AT THE EXISTING

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:17.838
FORMULA CONSIDERS. SO WE WANTED

01:46:17.904 --> 01:46:20.507
TO KIND OF HAVE A SPACE BETWEEN

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:21.942
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY

01:46:22.008 --> 01:46:22.609
TWENTY THREE ONE THING'S KIND OF

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:24.377
OUR ARE ANTICIPATED AND

IF WE ARE EACH YEAR. ADDING ONE

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.638
TIME FUNDS HAD SIMPLY HAVE TO

01:51:51.704 --> 01:51:53.339

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:57.644
FACTO THE ONGOING NEED. YET

01:51:57.710 --> 01:51:59.245
PARTS OF THIRTY SEVEN MINUS THE

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:00.680
REGULAR OF IT BUT I'M GOING

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:11.291
FORTUNATE A SURPLUS RIGHT NOW WE

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:13.526
WON'T HAVE IT FOREVER. SO IT'S

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:14.160
IMPORTANT MAKE SURE THAT WOULD

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:15.829
THAT THESE THINGS DON'T. SUFFER

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.397
AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OUR

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:20.400
FISCAL POSITION OF THE REALLY

01:52:20.467 --> 01:52:21.868
IMPORTANT IF THEY IF THEY YIELD

01:52:21.935 --> 01:52:23.136
RESULTS. SURE MY APOLOGIES FOR

01:52:23.203 --> 01:52:24.137
MISUNDERSTANDING A QUESTION THIS

01:52:24.204 --> 01:52:26.106
WEEK- IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT

01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:28.575
THE RIGHT NUMBER IS IF I JUST

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:29.943
FOR EXAMPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:33.413
HAPPENED RECENTLY- ARE OUR MOST

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.781
RECENT SOLICITATION LIKE I SAID

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:37.450
WE RECEIVED. A REQUEST FOR IN

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:38.451
EXCESS OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:41.354
MILLION- IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:44.791
RECEIVED REQUESTS IN EXCESS OF A

01:52:44.858 --> 01:52:45.825
HUNDRED NINE MILLION. SO THE

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:48.128
NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT HARDER

01:52:48.194 --> 01:52:50.763
TO POINT DOWN- BUT THAT THEY'RE

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:52.665
SO MANY IT YOU KNOW IS IN NEED

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.868
AND WE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:56.736
ALLOCATE NOT AS MUCH FUN AS WE

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:57.504
POSSIBLY CAN. READ AND I GUESS

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.973
THAT YOU KNOW THE BEST MOST

01:53:00.039 --> 01:53:00.607
OBVIOUS METRIC FOR SUCCESS IS

01:53:00.673 --> 01:53:02.942
RECIDIVISM. THE END I GUESS

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:04.911
THAT'S WHERE RECIDIVISM MAY COME

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:06.379
AT RIGHT THERE'S A COUPLE OF.

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:07.580
THOSE SINCE YOU KNOW THEIR

01:53:07.647 --> 01:53:09.215
TESTIMONY THIS COUPLE AREAS

01:53:09.282 --> 01:53:11.351
WHERE DATA ANALYSIS PROBABLY.

01:53:11.417 --> 01:53:13.119
NECESSARY VERY USEFUL TO FIGURE

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:14.787
OUT WHAT'S THE BEST USE OF

01:53:14.854 --> 01:53:16.222
FUNDS- I THINK INTUITIVELY KNOW

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:17.957
THAT THESE YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.626
ADULT REENTRY PROGRAMS FAR.

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:21.728
EMILY EFFECTIVE BUT DID IT BE

01:53:21.794 --> 01:53:23.530
REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT BY

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.365
WAY OF DATA SO THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:28.301
BETTER DECISIONS AS TO HOW WE

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:30.470
ALLOCATE FUNDS. SHOULD THANK YOU

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:31.070

OKAY I THINK WE'RE DONE- OKAY

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:44.150
JUST ONE QUESTION HOW MUCH OF

01:53:44.217 --> 01:53:46.186
FUNDING HAS GONE TOWARDS

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:47.620
