TWO FOR HAVING APPROVED A THE- REQUESTED MONIES FOR INCREASE OUT FOR SOME OF OUR- THAT AND THROUGH THE- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WANT TO THANK YOU FOR SIGNING OFF ON THE FUNDS THAT WERE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THAT DAD THAT HELPED US TREMENDOUSLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT. I BELIEVE OUR BUDGET. TRANSFERRING I BELIEVE OUR BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AT THE PARTY TO JUSTICE SO I MAY TRY TO FOCUS ON A FEW THINGS. AND I SUSPECT YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. ABOUT OTHERS. OUR WHILE MOST THE ATTENTION I THINK IT'S TAKEN UP IN THE NEWSPAPER AND MEDIA BY THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN REGARDS TO THE- ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN. AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UP QUITE HONESTLY THAT CONSTITUTES ABOUT JUSTICE HERE CALIFORNIA DOES. OP THAT 1% IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY THE LOS THAT. WE FILED. AT THE CENSUS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DONE IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PURCHASE. PARTICIPATE WITH PORTENT. ENDS A BILLION DOLLARS AS YOU KNOW IS AT STAKE AS A RESULT OF A CENSUS COUNT. UNDERCOUNT WE LOSE. ARE WE GONNA THE ISSUE PROTECTING HE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO. CALLED DREAMERS AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE SPRING COURT WAIT FOR DECISION ON THAT CASE. ARE WE ARE LEAD AND USED BEING THE- CORRECT JUST FOR. THE CALIFORNIA. MANAGER THE A. C. H. HERE BUT ALSO FOR THE RIVER THAT. AS WELL AND CASE NOW HEADING BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. BUT AS I SAID 99% THE WORK THAT WE DO. HAVE NOTHING YOU. WITH ANY ACTIONS. HE TO FACT. CONTEST SEGREGATION WAS STILL OCCURRING IN OURS DISTRICTS SAID IN THIS CASE IN MARIN SOUTH LEGAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE WE- WERE ABLE TO GET THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MOVE AWAY FROM- SEGREGATION PROGRAM THEY HAD WHICH KEPT MOSTLY MINORITY CHILDREN SEPARATED FROM- WHITE MAGIC IT'S BY THAT IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK UP WE- IN THE PAST. A HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MISSING PEOPLE AS A RESULT OF THE WORK THAT OUR FRIENDS X. UNIX DOES. WE COLLECTED SOME TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SETTLEMENTS OVER THIS LAST YEAR- AND SOME OF THEM YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE ACT- THE CASE AGAINST EQUIFAX THE CASE THAT WE GET A CASE AGAINST AETNA. WE RECENTLY DID TO MEDICATE MENTIONS WELL BUT ALL THOSE COME TOGETHER TO SHOW THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THEM. PRETTY TOUGH TO GET INTO SOME PARTICULAR. ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE WOULD BECOME VERY VERY ACTIVE A PLACE WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DIDN'T USUALLY FOCUS. ITS ENERGIES DIRECTLY WE DID NOT HAVE A SEPARATE UNIT. DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE ISSUES BUT SO MUCH OF AS A RESULT OF THE AC AND OTHER THINGS. HAS MADE THIS IS NECESSARY. SUTTER HEALTH I THINK YOU NOW KNOW THAT THE LARGEST HEALTH CARE THE- IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH US. AND OTHER PLAYERS AT WHERE. YOUR MICROPHONE AN- OUT WHERE. THEY HAVE AGREED TO PAY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR OUR PURPOSES THEY'VE AGREED TO MEN JUMPED OF TERMS WHICH WILL PREVENT FROM ENGAGING IN WHAT WE BELIEVE IS VERY. THANK BETTER BEHAVIOR AND THE RESULT WILL BE THAT. OUR EMPLOYERS ANY. ALL THEIR CUSTER AND THEIR EMPLOYEES FAR BETTER. WHEN IT COMES TO THE INSURANCE THEY GET FROM THE LARGEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE JOHNSON AND JOHNSON- WE RECENTLY SECURED A THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR JUDGMENT AGAINST JOHNSON JOHNSON FOR MARKETING. A OUT PUBLIC MASH IMPLANT IN WOMEN WHO HAD. INCONTINENCE ISSUES AND THAT WAS THE CASE JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE FORTY TWO OTHER STATES THAT SETTLED WITH J. AND J. ON THAT SAME ISSUE FOR TOTAL OF A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE GOT JUST FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE WERE UNWILLING TO SETTLE THE CASE. ARE THAT THE WHATEVER PHARMACEUTICAL CASE WHERE WE GOT CLOSE TO SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR BECAUSE THEY WERE THE WHAT WE CALL IT PAY FOR DELAY WITH THEY WOULD GENERIC PERSONABLE COMPANY NOT PRODUCE. OVER OF BRAND NAME. WHICH GAVE THE MIX CITY TO SELL JULY AND TO MAKE MUCH MONEY OFF ITS- WOULD THEN GIVE A CALL. BROUGHT TO THAT. ERIC WE WERE ABLE TO GET SOME SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM TELE FOR HAVING DONE THAT THAT'S ANTI COMPETITIVE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE WHY USE D. A. B. C. P. FROM OUR APARTMENT TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR- UNIT THAT DEALS WITH HEALTHCARE HEALTH RIGHT AXIS- UNITY. FOR TO DO THAT WORK ALONG WITH THE WORK GOING AFTER ANTI COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES TOTAL REQUEST THERE FOR TEN TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. CCB A- INTERNET PRIVACY PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS RIGHTS IN THE IN OUR OVER THE INTERNET SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER STATE OR THE PHOTOGRAPH IT HAS DONE TO DATE. OUR THAT LAW IS NOW IN EFFECT WE IN PREPARATIONS TO START OUR ENFORCEMENT COME JULY FIRST WHEN OUR RIGS ALIVE. AND I WANT TO THANK- THIS LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING US SOME OF THE RESOURCES NEED OPERA GIVE YOU. BLURB BASS I WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER STATE ACTORS WHO ARE IN THIS BASED PRINCIPALLY IN EUROPE WHERE THEY HAVE G. P. R. A SIMILAR. I REACHED MOVED THE- DINNER PRIVACY THEM I WROTE. SHE HAD HIM OF A ROOM FORTY PEOPLE. SHE HAD POPULAR IN THE- EIGHT THREE MILLION PEOPLE THE P. IS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE. BILLION DOLLARS. I SAT DOWN WITH THE U. CASE COMMISSIONER. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SIXTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE THERE. I'D BE A TWO POINT SIX TWO TRILLION DOLLARS. HE HAS A D. E. P. THAN EITHER ONE OF THOSE TWO NATIONS ARE OUR GDP IS TWO POINT NINE TRILLION BIGGER THAN YOU CASE. WE HAVE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE A TEAM OF TWENTY PEOPLE ENDS YOU CAN SEE THE HURDLES THAT WE WILL CONFRONT IN TRYING TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOW ARE YOU OF ALL OF OUR- CITIES WHEN IT COMES TO UP. THE INTERNET PRIVACY THAT THEY'RE NOW GOING TO EXPECT ANSWER TO EVERYTHING WE CAN OUR REGULATIONS AS A CENTER CLOSE TO GOING LIFE AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ITEM FORCE GIVEN THAT UNDER THE STATUTE WE ARE THE ONLY AGENCY THAT HAS THE- POWER. OF THOR TO DO THE FOUR K. AS JUST A QUICK WORD I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU PROBABLY ARE HEARING BACK HOME WITH BEHIND. I SPECIAL AND FOR I WANT TO DO WITH THE WAY BY GETTING A PAIN PAYING TAXES IS FEELING THE BURDEN OF THE MAJORITY OF PLAYERS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT AND IF YOU TALK TO MANY WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE GROUND AND THEY'LL TELL YOU THEY'RE THEY'RE OVERWHELMED AT SOME CASES OUTGUNNED ESPECIALLY THE RURAL COUNTIES AND I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO PLAY STATE TO HELP THEM LOOK. TO MAKE SURE HAVE A WAY FOR NAY WITH SO WE AFTER THOSE WERE TRYING TO DO WITH THE WRONG WAY IF WE IF WE REALLY MET THAT WE WANTED TO. A LOT CRIMINAL BASIC CAN BUT REYES. THE WE SHOULD DO A THE RIGHT WAY. DID YOU SEE THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL. THERE WAS A LONG STANDING BACKLOG OF SOME. ELEVEN HUNDRED OR SO CASES THE STATE AUDITOR WROTE A REPORT ON THAT- YOU ALL GAVE US THE TASK AT HAND THANK YOU FOR SOME RESOURCES ON THAT. TODAY THE OF THE ELEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE CASES WE REPORTED LAST YEAR THAT WE'RE BACK LIVE. A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE ARE LEFT. NOW AT THE SAME TIME WE CONTINUE TO GET CASES COMING IN. AND OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE CASES ADD TO THAT ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED OR SO THAT ARE CURRENTLY BACK WHAT FROM THE NEW LOW THAT IS COMMON. AND SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE TRYING TO PROCESS ALL THOSE THAT ARE WORKING THROUGH BUT- WE HAVE PROCESS SOME. OF FORTY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO CASES. THIS YEAR. ALONE BUT WE RECEIVED FORTY FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR CASES IN THIS YEAR OF THEM SO IT'S A IT'S A CONSTANT ISSUE OF. NOT ONLY TREAD WATER TRYING TO GET AHEAD. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. GO AFTER THAT AND HERE'S WHAT WERE YOU ARE I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL HELP US BECAUSE- WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT RATHER THAN JUST TRY TO DAY CARE THIS BACKLOG OF. CASES WHERE LICENSES ARE DOING. AND THE WORK BEING AND TO TRY TO. FIND OUT IF THESE FOLKS THESE AIR- GIMLI SHOPS ARE ABLE TO GET RELICENSED. IS IT'S THAT WAY TO LAST MOMENT WHEN THEY'RE UP AFTER TWO YEARS TO GET THEIR LICENSE RENEWED. WE SHOULD BE DOING WORK RIGHT NOW OF OVERSIGHT. AND SO WHEN WE GET TO THEM IT'S NOT THE LAST MOMENT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE OVERSIGHT. AND SO IT'S LIKE GOING TO RESTAURANTS. YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT IF THE COUNTY SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT RESTAURANT IS CLEAN. ONLY GOING. ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS WHEN IT'S TIME FOR THAT RESTAURANT TO GET RELICENSED. YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS WHAT THE- YOU KNOW IF THEY GET CAUGHT JUST ADVISE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT AND THEY WANT CLEAN IT UP RIGHT BEFORE IT'S TIME TO GET LICENSE. AS YOU WANT TO GET AN- AMBITIOUS AND HOW WE DO THIS IS THAT A WAY TO THE VERY END. SO WHEN I JUST TAKE CARE BACK WHAT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE- BCP QUEST. THERE IS THE ARE GAMBLING CONTROL FUND THAT'S USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. IT HAS RIGHT NOW NINETY MILLION DOLLARS WERE AT FOR FIVE MILLION FIVE POINT FORM. DOLLARS FROM THAT FUND. SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DO MORE WORK. EARLY SAID WAIT TO THE END. AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. CLARK OR- THE APP. THE OPERATIVE PERSON AND PROGRAM AGAIN FOR YOU FOR HELP IN ADDRESSING THAT. THE HISTORICAL BACK WHAT THAT EXISTED FROM. SOME MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY GONE NOW AND WE TRY TO REDEFINE WITH YOUR HELP IN FACT BY STATUTE WE'VE SORTED REDEFINED THE BACKLOG SO EVERYONE. IS ON THE SAME PAGE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON THE ARE PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM AND SO WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. BOB THIS YEAR WE HAVE CONTINUE THE PROGRESS WE'RE EXPANDING TO REACH OUT TO WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT A BIT MORE WE'RE FINDING THAT IT'S OF IT'S FAR MORE EFFECTIVE IF WE TRY TO GET WEAPONS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHEN WE FIND OUT SOMEONE IS PROHIBITED. THE WAITING TO TRY TO CATCH AFTER THEY GOT INTO THE EXTENDED CAP AND- RE JEFF. YEAH APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED CASES COMMITTEE IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE REMOVED APPROXIMATELY NINETY SEVEN HUNDRED CASES FROM THE LIST SO WERE AS I SAID WE WILL REMOVE THE BACKLOG WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PACE THE COMMUNITY BUT HERE'S THE REAL ISSUE THAT WE HAVE THAT I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOU. ARE WE HAVE FORTY KIDS TO DO THIS WORK. WE USED TO HAVE FIFTY OUR OUR OUR AGENTS ARE BEING PAID SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN- A SEAT P. OFFICER FOR EXAMPLE IS PAY OUR AGES WHEN THEY GET OPEN MORNING THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THEY'RE GONNA GO TRIED REMOVED WEAPON FROM SOME PROHIBITED THAT MEANS YOU'RE EITHER FELONS. OR DANGEROUS THAT'S WHAT THEY DO EVERY DAY AND UNTIL THEY GO TO BED THAT'S WHAT THEY DO YET THEY GET PAID AB MARK RATE BELOW BUT AS HE HI. AS PER KEEP UP BUT OUR AGENTS DO SOME IMPORTANT WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT THOSE FORTY FIVE AGENTS. THAT MEANS GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EACH AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIRTY SIX HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. EACH AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RAIN EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE. JADE IS RESPONSIBLE BECOMING MORE THAN AND COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S NOT DOABLE WITH FORTY FIVE AGENTS WE CAN'T DO IT WITH THE PAY THAT THEY RECEIVE AND SO WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SEE. RECOGNITION BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE DIRECT CONTROL OVER CLICK BARGAINING. BUT THAT WE CANNOT COME WE HAVE A FOR. VACANCY VACANCY RATE WE USED TO HAVE FIFTY EIGHT SINCE WE'RE DOWN OUT TO FORTY FIVE- AND STOP PAY IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPETE WITH LONG SPENT ELSEWHERE. YET THESE FOLKS MANY WOMEN ARE EIGHT DO. VERY DIFFICULT WORK. OF ONE OR TWO MORE FRIENDS X. WHICH WANT TO. MAKE SURE EVERY WITH CLEAR WHAT WE MEAN MY FRIEND. OF WHEN YOU SEE THAT KIND OF A PAIN IN THE NEAR. CALIFORNIA FATHERS CHARGED WITH MURDER FIVE OF HIS IT FINCH. NEW DNA TECHNOLOGY HELPED OFFICIALS CRACK A CASE THAT ITS STAR FOR A DOZEN YEARS. THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE DO AT OUR IN OUR FRIDGE FRIENDS X. BUREAU- IN A EVIDENCE EXONERATES HIM OF MURDER AFTER TWENTY YEARS IN THE- THAT'S THE WORK THAT OUR FRIENDS SIX. DOES ODD THESE ARE THINGS REDDING EDGE IN FACT OUR FORENSICS UNIT. IS ONE OF ONLY THREE SHOTS IN THE ENTIRE NATION AND THE OTHER TWO ARE THE FBI AND THE ARMY WHO ACTUALLY CAN NOW DO MITOCHONDRIAL- DNA FULL GENOME SEQUENCING THAT WHEN WE TRY TO GET INTO WHAT THAT IS OTHER THAN TO SAY TO BREAK THROUGH. IT LETS US GO AFTER BUT INSTEAD MAYBE BILL OR BE DONE BY OTHERS AND THE RESULT OR THINK LIKE WHAT SEE REPORTED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND THAT IS THAT ARE LIGHT LAUGHTER DOING THINGS THAT OTHERS CAN'T. PRIVATE LABS CANNOT DO WHAT WE DO PUBLIC LABS DON'T DO THE MISSING PERSONS IN FACT FAMILIAL DATABASE WORK THAT WE DO- WE PROVIDE EXTENSIVE FORENSIC CONTESTING FOR FORTY SIX OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S APPROX WE FOUR HUNDRED AGENCIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE RESEARCH PROX BUT THE SEVEN THOUSANDTH QUEST FOR NOW. HUNDRED TALK ABOUT DATA THANK SAMPLES. THERE'S TALK THESE DAYS THAT WE BE CHARGING. OUR PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. OTHERS AT RISK THE DA'S. FOR THE SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE. WILL TELL YOU THAT IF WE DO THAT THE FIRST QUESTION THAT EACH OF THESE AGENCIES BASKETS. SO WHICH CASE DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO SEND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. FOR ANALYSIS BECAUSE WE ONLY LIMITED. SO IF YOU WANT ME A I TELL ALLEN ANALYZE THE STE A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE. YOU WANT ME TO PUT A PROPERTY OR GIVING YOU THE EVIDENCE ON THE MURDER CASE OR VICE VERSA. NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE JUDGMENTS THEY GIVE US THE EGGS. BUT IT'S FOR BOTH. WE DO THE- I JUST I RIGHT NOW IN THE ATTACK ON RETIREMENT GIVING. OUR PARTNERS IN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RESOURCES I THINK THE BE UNFAIR FOR THEM TO HAVE TO. TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EVIDENCE IS MOST IMPORTANT AND SO I URGE YOU TO. CONTINUE O SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS EXPERIMENTALLY BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST ONE OF THE BEST THE NATION. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO SHOW THAT WE HELP OUR PARTNERS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO THE- THEY MUST. HAVE AN EARLY I WANT TO MENTION SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FORENSICS WE'RE HOPING TO CONSOLIDATE OUR LAB. FOR THREE PRINCIPLE REASONS. WE CAN EXPAND OUR LAB IN RICHMOND. OUR SPACE IS LIMITED. OUR RENT FOR RENTING FROM THE PRIVATE DATA- AT LAMBERT IS EXPENSIVE. AND WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T HIGHER IN THE BAY AREA FOR WHAT WE PAY. AND SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO COME IN SACRAMENTO SAC STATE IS LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH THEY'D LIKE US TO LOCATE ALONGSIDE THEM BECAUSE THEY WANTED THEY WANT KIDS. TO GO INTO FORENSIC IN THIS THAT FORENSIC SCIENCE AND THEY WOULD PROVIDE US WITH THE PERSONNEL THAT WE NEED MOVING INTO THE FUTURE. MOST OF FOR. LEON WHY BECAUSE THE WE END UP TRAINING THEM PROFESSIONAL EYES IN THE THAN THE GO GET MORE MONEY OUT IN THE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE AVERAGE HIGHER AB AVERAGE AGE OF THE HIGHER IN IN OUR RICHMOND LAB IS TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE. WHEN DO THEY LEAVE THEY LEAVE RIGHT WHEN THEY'RE THIRTY SEVEN IN THEIR PRIME. THEY'RE VERY SKILLED AND THEY MAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY OUR PAY DIFFERENTIAL DIFFERENTIALS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH OUR PUBLIC LAPS. AT THE PRIVATE LABS AND SO. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE IT BE EASIER TO RECRUIT HERE IN. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IF WE GOT A PARTNER AND CAL STATE LOOKING TO WORK WITH US SO. WITH THAT SAID I WANTED TO STEP BY STEP. I WANT TO. UNDERSTAND I SAID I THANK YOU FOR THE HELP IN RATIFY. THE CONTRACTS. OR AGENTS. THE ALARM FOR. BUT THAT CARD A SEAT THAT WAS A CENTER FOR OPERATIONS. IN I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL OF COULD. TO SEE THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SOMETHING AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN YOU ALL GAVE US. NEW ASSIGNMENTS THAT TOTALED FOUR BCP'S. I DID IN THIS TIME AROUND WE'RE HAVING TO REQUEST TWENTY ONE BCP'S BECAUSE F THE WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ASK DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DO AS A WE'RE READY TO DO IT WE JUST NEED THE RESOURCES AND I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS DEPARTMENT. EVEN THOUGH THEY LOVE TO BE PAID A LITTLE BIT MORE- HARD ARE DOING A SUCCESSFUL- JOB AT THIRD AT THEIR OPPOSITION TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME. QUESTIONS OKAY YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO I JUST. FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN DOING IN TRYING TO GET THE- WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PROHIBITED PERSONS HOWEVER- RIGHT I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN- AJ ASKED TWENTY. MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE CARE THAT BACKLOG AND WE SAID YES YOU MAY HAVE TWENTY FOUR MILLION BECAUSE WE ALL CARE ABOUT THESE GUNS BEING PICKED UP. THE BACKLOG IS STILL AT ABOUT NINE THOUSAND. SO I UNDERSTAND AND I HI BUT I IT SEEMS. YEAH YOU GOT RID OF SADDAM BUT NOW YOU HAVE NEW ONES ADDED AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW. THE RATIONALE HERE IN. THE INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE BECAUSE THE AT THE FIRST TIME WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WE WEREN'T TOLD WELL IT'S BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY PEOPLE ENOUGH IT'S WE JUST NEED MORE BODIES NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD WHAT WE CAN'T. AND I'M- THING OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT THE JOB IS NOT BEING COMPLETED BECAUSE WE NEED TO PAY PEOPLE MORE AND I. I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT- THAT'S TOUGH JOB IN THE SHOULD BE PAID WELL TO DO IT BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE A LITTLE DISJOINTED AND WHY WE AREN'T ABLE. TO GET THIS JOB DONE AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. IT'S NOT A STATIC ENVIRONMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE ADDED TO THIS LIST EVERY DAY BUT I. I THINK EVERYBODY ON. THE WEATHER YOU'RE SO I'M AND PARKS INTERN MY YOU. KNOW WANT AND IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE HAS TO HAVE THEM SO COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT BUT PLEASE. REMEMBER THIS THANK YOU FOR THE ARE. AND I THINK OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO. SORT OF. MMHM COMPARTMENTALIZE PEOPLE COULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE TODAY'S APPS PROGRAM IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE TWENTY THIRTEEN APPS PROGRAM SO FOR A FOR EXAMPLE. THE BACKLOG THAT EXISTED THAT. OF MONEY WAS PROVIDED FOR TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT'S GONNA. THAT WAS ADDRESSED BUT AS YOU MENTIONED. ALWAYS GETTING CASES AND ON TOP OF THOSE THAT EXISTED IN WERE PART OF A BACKLOG. AND AS I MENTIONED- OUT WE HAD ABOUT EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED NEW CASES COME IN THIS. WEEK CLEARED SOME NINETY SEVEN HUNDRED OF THEM. BUT HERE'S THE OTHER THING WE TRY TO DO FOR OF TRANSPARENCY. A LOT OF THOSE CASES THE THOUSANDS THAT YOU MENTIONED. ARE GONNA BE DIFFICULT EVERCLEAR. BECAUSE THERE'S A CATEGORY AND WE TRY TO READ READ TO FIND THE CATEGORY SO IT'S NOT CONSIDERED AT THE BACKLOG BACK WHAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE A CASES THEIR STOCK HAS ME WORK IT HAS BEEN. CLEARED THE CASES THAT WORKED. BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR OR WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CLICK THE ME GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE. OUR SOMEONE MOVED OUT OF STATE. IF THEY MOVED A STATEMENT BEFORE WE CLEAR THE WE CAN'T TAKE HIM OFF THE LIST EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION TO GO AFTER THEM GO OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THAT PERSON WE PROBABLY WOULD NEVER GET THE CLEARS THROAT A CALIFORNIA THEY READ SOME OF THE BEST STE THEY ALONG WITH COUNTLESS OTHER NOW STATE. MAIN ON THAT LIST AND LIKE THEY'RE SITTING THERE NOT UP THERE SOME PEOPLE WHO FROM WEAPON FOR PERCENT. OF THE FEDERAL PROBE MISSION WE DON'T THE JURISDICTION TO IT IN FOR. THAT LAW TO REMOVE. SO EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE WEAPON WE DO THAT WITHOUT OUR FOR PARTNER GOING INTO THE WORK AND SO THAT PERSON MAY SHOW UP BUT WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SOMEONE I'D- HAVE THE IN. THERE'S A DIFFICULT PLACE WE THAT PERSON AND IN FACT ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT PEOPLE THIS TAX YEAR WERE. THE FACT. THAT DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE MOVED OUT OF STATE THAT ARE STILL ON YOUR LIST WE CAN GET THAT NUMBER I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME RIGHT NOW BUT WE COULD PROBABLY GET OUT AND I'D BE INTERESTED IN CHECK OUT OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA EVERY OF THEM BUT- I THINK. THEY SAY I JUST. AS SOME MORE QUESTIONS COME TO MIND IT PLEASE CONTINUE EXCEED ONE OF THE THINGS. WE'RE HOPING IT TOO. AND BY THE- I THINK COMMITTEE REQUEST WAS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BE IS THE SYSTEM THE DATABASE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE USING IS SO ANTIQUATED THAT I WE SOMETIMES CAN'T SPIT OUT NUMBERS TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE WAY THE SYSTEM. IT TO FIFTY OF. TO DO IS MAKE IT SO IT'S- WHEN WE SAY A BACKLOG WHAT IS IT REFER TO WOMEN CASES PENDING WHAT WE FOR IT WHEN WE SAY CASES ACTIVE. BUT WE REFERRING TO BECAUSE THE CLEAN ACTIVE CASEWOULD. BRING TO SOMEONE'S MIND THAT WE ARE WORKING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO. IS AN ACTIVE CASE TODAY SO RATHER THAN USING BACKLOG AND ALL THE REST WAIT WAS IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. WE'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT CASES ACTIVE. OR PENDING ENDING A LOT OF THE SPACES THAT WE MAY NEVER GET TO TOUCH. AND IT'S ALL IT SEVERAL. PENDING BUT- JUST HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE CASES ARE THE ONES THAT WE THINK WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET TO EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE SOMEWHAT OLD BUT WE THE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PERSON MAY COME BACK INTO THE STATE. TO WORK THEM. BUT YOU THE- CONSTANT. THE NEW CASES EVERY YEAR WHAT THE CASE IS GOING OUT BUT YOU'RE STILL THAT BIG MASS IN THE MIDDLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER SERRA IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED THE WHAT'S THAT TO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN FIRST AGAINST THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN VARIOUS VENUES AND- I KNOW ONE OF THOSE LAWSUITS HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THE CREATION FOR WITHHOLDING FEDERAL FUNDS FROM STE TO CLEAR SANCTUARY CITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO LAST WEEK WE HAD A RIPPLING FOR SECOND CIRCUIT APPEALS STEP THAT THE- RUSSIAN DID. THIRTY TWO. A RULING FROM THE NINTH CIRCUIT THAT APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA- THAT HELD THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD IN THIS CASE IT WAS JAG GRANT MONEY FOR OUR LOCAL LAW. AGENCIES NINE MILLION FOR THE- YOUR SOAP BECAUSE TO SIXTY MILLION. WE ONE THAT THAT CASE BOTH IN THE LOWER COURTS IN IN THE APPELLATE COURTS SO THE SECOND QUARTER BUT- ONLY. APPLY IN THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT. THAT IS IT NEW YORK AREA BUT WHAT RENTS FOR CALIFORNICUM IT THANKS IT'S RULING SO THAT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT WITHHOLD. THE MONEY CAL. BECAUSE. HAVE A CLASH IN RULINGS CHANCES ARE WE WILL SEE THIS REACH THE SUPREME COURT TO MAKE IT. ON WHETHER NOT THE ADMINISTRATION FEDERAL MINISTRATION COULD TRY TO WITHHOLD SOME OF THOSE FUNDS AND- OKAY THANK YOU BUT- THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT ON. WHICH IS THAT. LOTS OF OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS FEEL LIKE THE CAUGHT THE CROSSFIRE HERE BECAUSE WE'VE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS FILE TO ME NOT AS OF LAST FALL'S OVER SIXTY LAWSUIT- PARTICIPATED ON A WHAT THE CURRENT NUMBER SEVEN OUTLINES. I PRESENT SEVEN CITIES AND A YEAR OF MY CITY ARE SAYING HEY LOOK YOU KNOW WE ARE IN A NET TAX TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET OUR FAIR SHARE OF THAT MONEY BACK YET DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT ALL OF US. I'M SORRY BRING OUR RELATIONSHIP. GOVERNMENT BECAUSE- EVERY TIME WHICH OUR EUROPE. AT ODDS THEM IF I. LOS OR IN CORD AND IN YOU KNOW THIS IS A NEED TO HAVE A BETTER. WITH THE FOR. MINISTER NOT AWAY REALLY. RESPOND TO THEIR CRITICISM. THAT THE POINT THAT. WE DO NEED TO HAVE A GOOD RELATE. IN FACT. WE SPEAK. MY AGING ARE. WORKING I. WITH THE FBI. D. E. A. NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS. IF WE DO A GREAT DEAL WORK WITH THEM WHETHER IT'S- GOING AFTER. HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. OR TAKING. GANGS WHETHER THE- WE'RE DOING ON. DRUG ENTERED. YOU DO THE- FEDERAL. AND IT'S WORKING. A VERY. AS WE ARE GOING TO SEND YOU. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE WANT YOU TO ENFORCEMENT LAWS WITH US. AND WHAT WE'VE IS. WITHOUT EVER. YOU HAVE EVERY IN FOR IMMIGRATION LAWS THAT'S VERY PART PRIVATE. BUT UNDER THE TO THE MEMBER YOU CAN TELL US DO YOUR FOR A- AND SO WILL CONTINUE TO SAY. YOU DO IMMIGRATION AND WE WON'T GET YOUR WAY IT JUST EXPECT US TO DO FOR. AND THAT'S WHAT WOULD POOR BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT STOPPING THEM FROM DOING THE WORK. WE JUST SAID YOU CAN'T FORCES TO DO YOUR WORK WITH YOU AND- AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS. I MEAN OUR OUR MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO THIS WORK. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR COURT FIGHTS GOING ON AND ALL THE REST. BUT I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE PARTNERSHIP THEY HAVE WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW FORCED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT COULD DO THE STATE DAY IN DAY OUT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO A NUMBER OF GANG TAKE DOWNS BECAUSE THOSE ARE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL- THE CANNABIS WORK WE DO THAT. DAILY WITH OUR OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- AND THAT WON'T STOP AND I HOPE.% I THINK ALL OF US WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD RESOLVE THE LEGAL TENSIONS THAT. BUT I HAVE TO FLY DEBATE. THAT'S BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TRY TO TAKE AWAY FROM AS THE GOES DIRECTLY TO OUR- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. THAT'S BEEN A BIG HURT. WE PROVED IN COURT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE. MONEY FROM US SURE. I WILL. CERTAINLY THAT IS TRUE IN THE SENSE OF COOPERATION FLOP PURSUANT AGENTS. BUT WHAT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS THAT. MY ELECTED OFFICIALS FEEL LIKE. THEY'RE VERY MUCH. OF BESIEGED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETS COLOR BY THE THINGS THAT GET DONE HERE. AND CHECK. ON THAT GOES WAY BEYOND. JUST IMMIGRATION I'M- OCT ABOUT THE FOR. WITH I LOST COVER WIDE VARIETY TOP SO IF I JUST WANT TO PASS ON THAT FEEDBACK BACK YOU THAT YOU ARE THE MUCH FEEL. THEY'RE REALLY WITH GOVERNMENT ABILITY TO BRING THEM BACK TO QUE IS BE IMPACTED BY THOSE TO SAY BUT HEY I AM YOU FOR DAUGHTER AT FARM ANALYST I. WE TRY TO BE WHERE WE LOCAL PARTNERS IT'S GOING ON RIGHT THANK THANK YOU STONE. GOVERNMENT REGARDLESS ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATES. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STANDING UP FOR CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS. AND WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. TO BE THAT STRONG ADVOCATE AND ENSURING THAT THAT OUR VALUES ARE PROGRAMS. ARE BEING. OF HELD IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY SO. THAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB IN THAT STANDPOINT A WRECK. REALLY RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA'S VALUES OVER ALL THE IF EN AB STONE IF I COULD JUST COMMENT BRIEFLY- GO BACK TO WIN. SO NUMBER. THE IT. IS NOT QUE. WE DON'T REACH OUT TO THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE WE SU IN EVERY CASE WE ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION WITH WHAT WE TRY TO GET RESEARCH PUT IN RIGHT. IS DEALING WITH FRANCE FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT WHETHER IT'S BEEN THE CASE IS BARB INVOLVING THE ENVIRONMENT- WE HAVE ALWAYS. COMMUNICATED OUR CONCERNS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEFORE WE TAKE AN ACTION FACT WE'RE ALMOST REQUIRED TO BECAUSE MOST OF THE ACTIONS ARE BASED ON ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHERE THERE'S A LEGAL COMMENT PERIOD AND SO WE REACHED OUT TO THEM WE'VE ALSO DURING THE COMMENT PERIOD PROVIDED OUR COMMENTS IN WRITING SO IT'S NOT AS IF WE'RE- WE'RE AT TRYING TO YOU KNOW DO AN END RUN- BROADSIDE ANYBODY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT OUR CONCERT. THEN IF THE- TIMES THAT. CAN ACT AS WELL NOT BEEN ABLE TO. IT'S FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT PROTECTS THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE DISAGREEMENT ABOUT. WHICH TRULY IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECT THAT BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY FOLKS DON'T GET INFORMATION. ON THESE CASES THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE SUBTLETIES ESPECIALLY THE LEGAL SUBTLETIES. OF THE CASE BUT WE DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO BOTH IN. FEDERAL OUR LOW. BECOMING DOWN. LET'S SEE. ENGINE THE- THAT THE WASHINGTON DC SENDING OUR WAY. AND I- AN ABBEY WORK WITH YOU FOR AWHILE AND I APPRECIATE NOT ONLY A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE- AND I. COMMEND YOU ON COMING IN AND HAVING SOME REALLY DIFFICULT THINGS TO WORK ON- ONE OF THINGS I WOULD. TO HELP YOU WITH IF THE- INDIVIDUAL WORKED IN THE MORTUARY INDUSTRY FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. AND HELP BUILD. THE FORENSIC RELAPSE DAY HAS BOTH THE MONEY IN THE CITY AND CAL STATE LA. WHERE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEARNING TO GO INTO THE FORENSIC SCIENCE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- I CAN SEE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS DO YOU. WHAT DID IN LA SIR WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO REPLICATE IT IN SACRAMENTO BECAUSE THE VALUE. OF BRING IT THE END. EDUCATE MODEL AND THEIR HANDS REAPPLY EXPERIENCE. I'M YOU YOU GET THAT IT. AND I AB FIVE WHEN. SPOT FIRSTHAND- REALLY IMPRESSED STUDENT BODY. SOCOULD WORK TOGETHER TRY CREATE. A GREAT MAY NOT WHAT THE- DID YOU. THAT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE THING. TWO MORE BOB I AND ALSO AND THE RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT DID DREAMERS AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE- AND RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED HOPEFULLY I KNOW LAWSUIT. JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON IN HUGE YOU MAY HAVE TO DO A ADJUSTMENTS TO GET MORE BUT I THINK THIS IS ONE THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- REALLY IMPORTANT A CALIFORNIA REALLY IMPORTANT TO MY DISTRICT AND SO WHAT RESOURCES DO YOU NEED TO CONTINUE THAT. THAT DIALOGUE AND BUT WITH THE COURT. AS YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IS IT'S THE FUTURE. THIS FEATURE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO STE TO INVEST IN IT AND PROTECT THEM- AND THEN- THE LAST THING IS CANNABIS. WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET REALLY THE ILLEGAL MARKET- I HAVE A BILL WERE RIVER WE WANT TO TAKE. FUNDING FOR WILL TAKE THE PENALTIES FROM THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TO MAYBE FIFTY THOUSAND ON LANDLORDS. AND THEN MAYBE USED TO LANDLORDS TO KICK THESE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS TO LOSE THEIR BUSINESS AND MAYBE WE COULD WORK TOGETHER. TO USE THAT IS AB HOPEFULLY A VALUABLE TOOL TO SHUT DOWN DALY CANNABIS AND IN THE STATE LIKE IN A YOU KNOW A LOT LA. IS MAYBE I CAN FORTY FOUR LEGAL ONES IN OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED ILLEGAL ONES. IT JUST NO WAY YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH IT. BUT IF WE LAND. FORCED HIM OUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR BUILDING. ORGAN AND BEEN BEING JUST PROPERTY OWNER HONEST CAL. COULD BE. EFFECTIVE AND HOPE. WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TWO SIDED WITH THREE THINGS HI ALL JUST COMMON. WE MATCH ON THIS ON THE LAST ONE AND SAY- WE'RE READY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S A ROLE THAT WE COMPLY. AND I WOULD ASK THAT WE INCLUDE. AS WELL THE LAW. PARTNERSHIP HAVE IT ALL LEVEL. NO THEY HAVE SOME. VERY GOOD COUNSEL TO PROVIDE AND THE LAW I KNOW THEY WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE BE PART OF ANY SOLUTIONS AND THEY'RE GONNA BE THE ONE THAT ARE ASKED TO RESPOND FIRST. THANK YEAH I DID THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M JUST GOING BACK TO OUR- THE DIALOGUE THAT YOU'VE BEEN HAVING WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO FROM WHAT I CAN SEE BETWEEN FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BILL HAS BEEN ABOUT ROUGHLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO. HOW MANY MORE LAWSUITS ARE YOU GONNA FILE AND HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST TAXPAYERS WHO SAW HOW MANY MORE AT IT DEPENDS ON MANY MORE TIMES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA TRY TO DO THAT WOULD BREAK OR THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA WHAT IT COSTS WELL THANK YOU QUICK IDEA THAT THOSE TWO LAWSUITS JAG GRANT MONEY FOR LOCAL FORSMAN. SAVES MILLION DOLLARS. I BUT IF FOR A FOR A FACT A IT IS TWELVE MILLION THAT'S A ONE FIFTH OF THE COST OF TO THE LAWSUIT SAID WE BEGIN WITH THAT I THINK HOURS WOULD AGREE THAT IF WE HAVE DECENT WITH THE CENSUS THE- THAT. PERMITTED US TO GO FOR WITH THAT. THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE SENSES COULD SAVE US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. YOUR QUESTION IS TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER TRAJO JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE OR QUESTIONS ROCK REGARDING CAPS TO REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK- THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ON APPS I. SHARES THE SAME CONCERN THAT IS REGARDING THE- WORK THAT IS STILL PENDING CAN CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW MANY. IN THE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF. CASES ARE THE CASES THAT YOU BELIEVE YOUHAVE THE ABILITY TO CLEAR RIGHT NOT BUT THE ONES THAT WITHOUT A STATE THAT THE ONES THAT ARE FEDERAL JURISDICTIONS NOT THE ONES THAT. FOR LET ME TELL. HOW BIG A NUMBERS ON THAT WOULD BE SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN SO IT'S STILL SO STILL FROM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LARGE THE MAJORITY OF NINE THOUSAND THAT MY COLLEAGUE REFERENCED SO TO ONE ISSUE THAT WE TALKED TO YOU IN THE ISSUE ARE ARE. BEING EQUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I. YOUR LAST YEAR WE HAD. WHY NOT. A POTENTIALLY INSTEAD OF TO TRY TO COMPETE WITH LOCAL OFF OF PETITIONS WHY NOT THANK YOU JUST DO A GRANT PROGRAM WHICH GRANT MONEY TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU MISTER YOUR OFFICES ARE ARE STATIONED HERE. IF WE WANT TO GO TO LAKE ELSINORE TO GET SOMEBODY'S GUNS THEY HAVE TO FLY THERE RIGHT NOT FROM THERE THEY'RE NOT ON THE GROUND- AND IF THEY IN THE- THEY DON'T GET THE- FLY BACK HERE. SO WHY NOT GIVE IT. COUNTY OR THE CITY. CAN WORK WITH THEM THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY GO WHO AND THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL DAY LONG THAT'S WHERE THEY LIVE THAT TO DETER PEOPLE THEY MAIN WELL. WHY NOT. OR DOES IT THE HUGE NUMBERS OF NOT HUGE NUMBERS BUT THE LARGE SUMS OF LOCAL LAW FOR THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY- GO APPREHEND THESE KINDS THAT WE THINK ARE THAT PATENT THAT'S EXACTLY THE GERMAN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND WE'VE BEEN. IS THE FIRST YEAR WE HAD DONE A DEEP. IN THE PROGRAM. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE HAD WAS THAT WE ACTUALLY START THE PARTNERSHIP UP WITH OUR LOCAL LAW FORCED HER PARTNERS. UP FORTY FIVE AGE CAN'T COVER THE ENTIRE STATE APPS THERE ARE THINKS SEVENTY SEVEN BOB SWOPE. NOW YUP. THAT'S THAT'S A BIG FORCE. TWO THINGS WITH HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH RESOURCES UNDERSTOOD RIGHT AND SECONDLY THE STILL HAVE TO WORK WITH US BECAUSE- EACH OF THOSE AGENTS. YOUR SIX ONLY IN THEIR JURISDICTION. A COUNTY SHERIFF CAN'T GO BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE COUNTY A CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT KEPT WILL BE ON THE BOARD SO SOON IS THAT. ARM ARE PRETTY PRICES THERE BUT- THEY CAN'T MATCH. THEY HAVE TO CALL NEXT AGENCY DASKA SO WE'D WE CAN WE CAN GO ACROSS ALL THOSE JURISDICTIONAL WHY. AND SO WE CAN PROVIDE THE GLUE KEEP THE- THE WORK GOING TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO WORK UP THE CASE AT THE BEGINNING. THE FIGURE OUT THIS TO THAT IS ON THE- DO THEY LIVE AT THE OLD DRESS HAVE BEEN MOVED ON. ANY WEAPONS REGISTRY YOU WORK ON. THAT OF COURSE YOU START WITH THE FIELD WORK PREPARING FOR THE FILL WORK TO ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE TO- A CV CAN APPREHEND THE WEAPON. AND THEN IT'S THE RIVER. AFTER MUCH BURKE OF FORTY AFTER. USED LOCAL FORTUNE HASN'T BECAUSE A- WIRED. KURD SO SOMETIMES WE FELT WE ACTUALLY. WIELD THERE WERE A- CHEN ON LIST WHO APPARENTLY HAD BEEN WE WORK IT UP GO OUT IN THE FIELD. PERSON SAYS I TURN THAT INTO YEARS AGO. AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT SURE ENOUGH THEY TURNED IT IN IT'S IN THE- EVIDENCE LOCKER OF THE LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY BUT THEY NEVER REPORTED TO US SO IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK UP THE CASE CORRECTLY. MICHAEL SO THAT'S WHERE WE CAN USE OUR PARTNER. THAT AND THEN EVERYBODY THEN REPORT AFTERWARDS THE RESULTS THIS WAY OUR NUMBERS. ARE THEY THEY THEY THEY CORRESPOND WELL. YOU LOOK WE'RE WE'RE ALL- ALMOST AT WILL I WILL I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF I MEAN I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OF YOU CONTINUING TO. OKAY THIS EFFORT BUT I THINK THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBED IS THOSE FORTY ONE OF THOSE FORTY FIVE AGENTS WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE GROUND. WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S WHERE. THE BOTTLENECK ACCOUNTING BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED. YEAH YOU JUST. DIVIDE. SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE FORTY FIVE AND IT'S A FAIRLY. THE TICKET NUMBER LESS ONE PERSON. THOUSAND GUNS STATE OF SO I MEAN- HOW HOW DO YOU. HOW DO WE GET THIS PROBLEM AND YET STILL BE ABLE TO SCALE YOUR FORTY FIVE. OFFICERS IN THE SAME TIME BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE LIKE YOU SAID THE SEVENTY THOUSAND LOCAL OFFICERS THAT WE HAVE. I THINK IF THE LEGISLATURE THINKS OF APPS AS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM. THAT INVOLVES EVERYONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS EVERYONE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE A DUTY TO HELP RECOVER A WEB. THEY'LL GET SOME RIGHT TO THE DONE. THEN WHAT WE DO IS TRY TO FIGURE TO COURTNEY INNOCENT BY WAS NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THE COURTS AS WELL BECAUSE THE COURTS TO THE ONE THAT ULTIMATELY CALLOUS DISPERSED LONGER HAS. THE RIGHT TO. AND SO WE- WERE NATIVE BECAUSE IT IS FAR EASIER AS I SAID EARLIER. TO RETRIEVE A WEAPON. BEFORE THE PERSON GETS LOOSE. AND ROAMS THE STATE. THEN AFTERWARDS- THE BEST JOB WE CAN DO IS AT. THE MOMENT THE PERSON BECOMES. A NAME ON THE APPS SYSTEM WE GET THE BEFORE THEY GET LOOSE. SO IT'S MORE MATTER COORDINATION THAT'S WHY THINK WE ARE ENTERING A NEW. STAGE WITHIN THE APPS PROGRAM. I THINK FUN. AS MY COLLEAGUE EARLIER MENTIONED. IN THE PAST. POINT EN EN. APPROPRIATE THE RESOURCES THAT WAS REQUESTED AND IT WASN'T IT WASN'T WE NEED TWENTY FOUR MILLION AND X. Y. Z. WHICH IS WE NEED FOR MILLION WE KIND OF ASSUME THAT WE WOULD SEE- SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE ON THE BACKLOG I THINK THERE'S- I THINK FRUSTRATION FROM THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE DONE OUR PART. PORT FOR DOESN'T. LIKE IT'S THE AS MUCH PROGRESS AS WE HAD HOPED AND SO I THINK THAT- I THINK GOING TO STAND THERE NEEDS TO BE. BETTER COORDINATION BUT HERO I ITEM I DON'T KNOW THAT MONEY BY ITSELF SOLVE THE COORDINATION ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ME YOU KNOW WE CAN APPROPRIATE MONEY I CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE OR GET A ROOM OR TO DESIGN A PLAN- AND SORT OF. WORKING ON THIS SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WE- ALL THOUGHT THE SENSE OF URGENCY THERE THERE IS NO. I DON'T THIS IS A SINGLE PERSON IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT AS OPPOSED. TO INSURANCE YOU GET THE ARE ADEQUATELY SAYS THAT- LOCALLY GET THE ARE. AS WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE BIT. ON THE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WALL WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC GET THEIR GUTS. UP JIMMY BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS AN ACT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY PREDECESSORS IN THE WORK THAT WAS DONE BUT THAT MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. I DO KNOW THAT. IS WITH THE MONEY ONE WAS IT WAS FOR THE- THERE'S JUST WAY HIGHER. TO DO THIS WORK WITH SO WHEN WE SAY SOME TO SOMEONE YOU GETTING THIS JOB FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE TO DO THIS FOR SIX MONTHS AND I CAN GUARANTEE DO YOU JUST GET TO STICK AROUND TO ONE OF THE THINGS I NEED. TO BE THEN. THE MONEY EVAPORATED IT WAS FOR FIVE YEARS I BELIEVE SO IT BY THE TIME I CAME IN IT WAS ESSENTIALLY GONE- AND- I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE- WE REQUESTED MONEY THIS LAST TIME FOR áP. SECOND TELLS. IF YOU ARE PERMANENTLY I CAN'T SEE WHAT YOU WERE BUT I AT LEAST KEEP YOU WANT PERMANENTLY CANNOT NETWORK THE LOW TO YOU POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK NOW LOCAL LAW SEE A FUTURE IN AB FOR THEM. AND A MATTER OF. THANK YOU IT A- THERE'S ABSOLUTE NEED THOUSAND SWORN PIECE OFF OUT IS OUT THEY CAN DO WAY THAN FORTY FIVE AGENTS AND IT'S MATTER OF SURE THAT WE DO WE'RE ESSENTIALLY THE GLUE YEAH THAT KEEPS EVERYONE WORKING TO AND I THINK THE SOONER WE GET TO THAT THE BETTER OFF CAL. LOW. GREAT THE BILL WITH. TO SEE. YOUR PROFITS RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE OFF CAN TO BE ON THE CLOSE GOTTA BE COORDINATOR FOR THE PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MORE CONCERNED BECAUSE FOR WHATEVER REASON HAS THE OP HASN'T REALLY BEEN A TO. LEADERS WALLS WITHOUT HI WOULD JUST TELL YOU A WAS. IN TASK TASK TO GIVE. AT OUR HIGH WILL ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT THERE WAS NO WAY PLUS IN THE TWENTY THIRD INTO. TWENTY I SUSPECT EACH OF YOU COULD PROBABLY NAME LEAST FOR DAY LAWS THE YOU. THAT ACTUALLY INCREASED IN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE LIST. AND SO IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE THAT LIST AT. THERE I'M CATEGORIES WHO WHO NOW FALLEN THE CAT INTO THIS CLASS WHO THE RIGHT ACCESS WERE. AND SOAK IT JUST. I THINK ACKNOWLEDGE NOW I THINK EVERYONE OF TO MAKE THE CSUS WORK. AND PART OF IT IT'S ALL OF A- NOT JUST LOCAL ON. THE DIGITAL JERRY STILLER. IN IN THEIR- SHE OR HER TEAM HAD MADE SOME GOOD I THINK THAT'S CONCERNING REMARKS REGARDING- YO. DESPITE THE FACT THAT- ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WERE GIVEN. THAT THERE SEEM TO BE A REDUCTION IN THE EFFICIENCY OF THOSE. INDIVIDUALS ARE JUST WONDERING WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT THE- SO. AGAIN THIS WHICH I SORT OF INHERITED THIS AGAIN- THIS IS THAT WE'VE A MORE LONG TERM ISSUE THAN EVEN APPS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE- GAMING LAWS IN PLACE FOR A LOT LONGER I'M I'M TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. THEY NEVER BEEN A AN AMBITIOUS THE PAPER THIS AMBITIOUS EFFORT. TO ENFORCE OUR GAMING LAWS IN THE STATE. AND I THINK THE STAKEHOLDERS KNOW THAT. I CAME IN AND I TOLD ALL THE STICKLE. FROM ALL PERSPECTIVES OF THIS. AND SO HERE I'M TALKING TO BE HONEST UP TO BE CLEAR WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE CARD ROOM OWNERS. INDIAN GAMING I SAID TO THEM. I KNOW EVERYBODY'S BEEN UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY IN FOR SPENCE BEEN DONE. I'M GONNA CHANGE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU LIKE OR NOT BUT I'M TO CHANGE IT I NEED TO GET A NEW DIRECTOR IN BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DIRECTOR AND WE GET A NEW DIRECTOR I GOT A NEW DIRECTORY. WE'RE NOW MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO FORCE SOME PEOPLE LIKE SOME PEOPLE HATE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU THIS WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA START DOING OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT THAT'S WHY RECENTLY WE WENT AFTER HAWAIIANS GARDEN CASINO WE THEM THREE OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR VIOLATING THE GAMING LOST- WE GET IT THAT EMERGENCY CLOSURE OF MEGA. SENA WE FOUR CASES NOW PASS REPOSE CASINO AND TINO MERS BILL ON THEIR LICENSES AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IS WE'RE GONNA START TO ENFORCE. SO TELL ME WHAT YOUR POINT WHAT I THINK WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT WAS WE WENT WE STILL THE RIGHT BEFORE THE SINCE. ABOUT THE- NEW. AND WHAT. DEVELOP AND THE THAN THE DEATH. PRETTY MUCH DONE WITH THE BACK BUT HE WHAT I TELL YOU WHAT ARE MY STUMP BLOCK. WE WERE HAVING ANALYST TO THE- OF IT MINISTRY PERSONNEL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ADMINISTRATIVE PERSON OF THAT THAT THE CLERKS THE CLERK OF FOLKS. SO THE ALLIES WERE THERE NOW SAYS AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD. YOU OF THE AUDITOR REPORTS SO I TOLD BY TEAM YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE SOMEONE DO SOMEONE ELSE'S JOB DO YOUR ANALYST DROP SO THAT THAT THEY'RE DOING BUT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH.% ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF I NOTICED SUPERVISORS DOING THE WORK OF SO WHEN IT'S IN SOME CASES FOR CLASSES. CLASSIFICATIONS BELOW THEM AND SO WE'VE AT RISK REQUESTED DOLLARS FROM THE FROM FUND THAT'S OF WHAT HAS NINETY MILLION WE'VE REQUESTED FIVE BILLION SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT WORK BUT RATHER THAN JUST WAIT TO THE LICENSE IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE IN THERE NOW ASKING FOR RENEWAL. THE CHECK. SINCE WE'RE GONNA START CHECKING ALL THE WAY. AND THIS WAY WE KEEP YOU ON YOUR TOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS IN AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO NOW DOING REGULATIONS ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES WHICH I SUSPECT YOU ALL WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH WAY CAR I'M JOHN. AND DEALER ROTATION ISSUE AND ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN KEEP BE SO CALLED CROSS BANKING BETWEEN. CASINOS THESE ARE ALL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME. SO MY SUSPICION IS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF. CHURNING ABOUT. WHERE THIS WILL TAKE THEM. AND QUITE HONESTLY I'M LIMITED BY THE EXISTING STATUTE. AND YOU ARE WILL BE LIMITED UNTIL YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE STATUTES AND SO WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE SUPPOSED. TO FIND OUT THERE TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO DO OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE NOT GONNA. BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AUDITOR'S. FINDINGS I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERNING PART IS BECAUSE- ON IT FROM A FROM A BUDGET COMMITTEE STANDPOINT. IF WERE GIVING MORE MONEY AND WE'RE SEEING LESS EFFICIENCY. ARE SORT OF RAISES A RED FLAG SOMEONE IF YOU COULD JUST SPECIFICALLY COMMENT ON THAT ONE CHICKEN FRIED YEAH AND THAT I'M NOT I CAN. TO HAVE THINGS WE HAD BEEN SENT TO THE PAST. LAST YEAR I MENTION THE NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE HERE WHEN I MENTIONED NUMBERS BUT- WE HAD. AT THE TIME THE AUDIT THERE WERE. WHEN THE- AND TWENTY NINE CASES THAT WERE BACK. THAT WERE WAITING FOR LICENSE. AND HAD NOT BEEN PROCESSED- THAT WAS A YEAR AGO. TODAY THAT NUMBER IS NOW DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. SO WE CLEARED ALMOST ALL THAT BACK. AND WE'RE DOING IT WITH THE AND MY SUPERVISORS HAVING TO DO THE WORK OF SOMEONE IS FOR THREE TO FOUR CLASSIFICATIONS BELOW THEM BECAUSE I'VE TOLD THEM YOU DON'T USE ANALYST TO DO THAT YOU USE ALICE TO START DOING THE- THAT DOES IT FOR THE- PROBLEM. A AND WHAT WE'RE REQUESTING A MONEY IS A THAT WE CAN FINALLY PUT MONEY INTO THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED IT AND MIKE MIKE MY COMMITMENT TO YOU IS IF WE GET THE RESOURCE AB I WILL SHOW YOU THE NUMBERS AND ADAM BE TRANSPARENT WITH A NUMBER. AND I HOPE. AGAIN AS WE DID. YOUR SECOND SHOW YOU RESULTS THE- OTHER ONE QUESTIONS MAKS. COMPLETE SENSE TO ME THAT. THE ENFORCEMENT. ARM OF THESE LAWS IS IN YOUR AGENCY I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD A SENSE OF THE LICENSING PART OF IT BECAUSE LICENSING TRADITIONALLY WOULD BE SAY IN DCA WHEREAS YOU KNOW JUST LIKE WE HAVE WITH CANNABIS RIGHT THE ENFORCEMENT PART IS IN YOUR AGENCY IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT DCA BOTH ENFORCEMENT BY SOMETHING. ARM WHICH WE YOUR A HAS BOTH BEEN TAKEN AND IF YOU HAVE THOUGHT TO WHAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE SEPARATE OR REMAIN TOGETHER- IT IT SEEMS THE ONE AREA. WHERE HI YOU HAVE BOTH. AND I JUST GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE'D TOTALLY NON NON SEQUITUR BUT WE HAVE A RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH IS KIND OF FAILING BECAUSE WE HAVE AN AGENCY THAT DOES THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO WAS IN CHARGE OF ENFORCING THEN IN THAT OTHER AGENCY WE ARE TAKING A HARD LOOK WHAT AT THAT CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE. YET WE CAN. POINT OUT A COUPLE OF OTHER. AND THAT THE AREA OF. PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL LICENSING THERE'S SOME ISSUES AND THERE'S A MODEL THAT HE HASN'T TOTALLY WORK- WHERE WE ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONES TO PROSECUTE THE CASES ACT BUT ANOTHER AGENCY ACTUALLY% INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND TOO OFTEN WE'RE FINDING THAT THE SKIT WORK IS INCOMPLETE. AND WE HAVE TO ASK NICKEL BACK BEFORE WORK BETTER PROSECUTED CASE SO AT THERE'S A VALUE IN HAVING SOMEONE WHO COULD CONNECT ALL THOSE. AND BY YOUR SITE AND THE ENFORCEMENT CASE AND THIS IS A- THIS IS A SENSITIVE AREA- GAMBLING HAS TRACTORS AND A BAD SUPPORTERS AND I MEET AT- DETRACTORS AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I THINK IF SO LONG AS- I CAN GET THE SHOP IN PLACE WE HAVE THE PERSONNEL THAT WE NEED. AND THAT YOU WILL. WITH THE READ THIS. THAT AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS WORK OUT WE WILL DO RIGHT FROM A DIZZY AND WE WILL PERFORM AND WE WILL SHOW YOU THE NUMBERS AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SEE THAT WE PERFORM IF WE DON'T THEN CERTAINLY I THINK YOU SHOULD. CONSIDER SOMETHING ELSE BUT I WOULD HOPE YOU GIVE US A CHANCE TO SHOW THAT WE CAN PERFORM. OKAY BUT I'M SAYING YOU MY FIRST YEAR I THINK IS BUDGET CHAIR- WE GAVE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS IT'S JUST PER THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS IN THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FISCAL YEAR SO THIS IS NOT AGAIN THE FIRST TIME THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND AGENCIES COMES AHEAD IT WAS POSITIONS. THE MESSAGE WHICH DAPSONE. IT A WEEK I DON'T THINK WE PICKED. THE THIRTY TWO POSITION THAT THE THAT THE REQUEST OF THE- DEPARTMENT LEAVE WITH A FEEL THAT REQUEST I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM KNOWING. THE BACKLOG KNOWING- AGAIN THE WORK THAT NEEDED TO BE THERE BUT THEN AGAIN WHEN THE AUDITOR. FINDS A LACK OF EFFICIENCY REGARDING A PARTICULAR THOSE POSITIONS I THINK THERE'S SOME CONCERN HAVE FOR FUTURE POSITIONS IT IT IF I HAD BEEN YOUR TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN. I'D BE RISK ENDING AS BEST I COULD. NOT HEAR THEN I LIKE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED THEN BOOK BUT I CAN DO IS GERMANY'S. TELL YOU WHAT I WILL MAKE SURE MY TEEN DIES AND ANY PASTOR HAS DONE. AND I WOULD HOPE THEN THAT YOU WOULD JUDGE THE DEPARTMENT ARE OUR WORK. BY WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE CAN DO I WISH I COULD TELL YOU I COULD. THIS IS A TO YOU WHAT HAPPENED WITH APPS BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN I COULD TELL YOU WHAT. THEY WANT. I CAN TELL. YOU RIGHT NOW. WITH THE WHICH THERE WILL. WE CANNOT YOU YOU. S. ATTACK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GAME. AND AGAIN AN AUDITOR REPORT CAME BACK AS IT WAS A REAL TROUBLE. TO US TO DO. STATION THE SEARCH. AND NOW NOT ONLY RABBINIC UP WITH NEW RAGS NOW WORLD DO INSPECTING THE LA POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR SOME REPORTS OF HOW THEY HAD CONDUCTED THEMSELVES ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT MY TEAM UNDERSTANDS THAT WE GOT MARCHING OR WILL BE THE BEST WE CAN AND I AM NO PROBLEM WE CAN FORM. A STATE GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT WHAT SO LONG AS WE GOT IT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN. THANK YOU. OKAY ONE THANK YOU- THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES I THINK PROBABLY THE QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. I HOPE SO. ONE OF ONE WANT TO THANK THE AG I KNOW WHEN YOU COME- WE KEEP YOU IN A LONG TIME ON HOW TO SEE BECAUSE I DON'T SEE WHAT ONCE A YEAR THAT'S OKAY THAT'S ENOUGH. IT'S ENOUGH TO GET YOU GOING FOR THE YEAR BUT UP CLEARLY WE RAISE A NUMBER OF ISSUES WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE THUS FAR AND YOU HAVE SOMETIMES INITIATED THINGS LIKE THE GATE ISSUE THAT THAT THAT CAME OUT. AND HAVE BEEN WORKING TO READ TO BASICALLY ENFORCE MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE. WANT TO THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY FOR THE DESCENT DISCRIMINATION QUE THE CARD THAT THAT THE GAME KATE THE CARD CALIFORNIA WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT THAT THAT THAT AREA IS. THE TO SEE IT WE WILL IMPORTANT AND THE- SEE SOME POP UPS FROM. FROM WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN NUMBER. I. CORD CLEARLY AYE AYE AYE WE ARE ALL CONCERNED CAN SITUATION AS BY SINCE BELIEVE THAT US NOW BELIEVE CANNABIS IS GONNA SO ALL THE FOR PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD AND KIND OF LIKE THE LOTTERY AND UP AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT MAGIC BRING THAT'S GONE SOLVE EVERYTHING NOW WE- HAVING MORE. PROBLEMS I AT ALL TO DO WITH WITH WITH ALL THE LEGAL STUFF I'VE I THINK SOMEONE'S WE MAY WE SHOULD MAKE IT ALL THE LEGAL AGAIN SO WE CAN STARTLED AND THOUGH EVERYBODY OUT. AND START A DIFFERENT WAY BUT- AB HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT A COMMISSION IT'S GOT TO GET THE WORKING THAT HASN'T WORKED YET. AND A HOST OF OTHER THINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE IT- THIS MAKES SENSE AT THIS POINT BUT- AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION AND- AND THAT HAPPENS WHEN THINGS ARE. TO DO THE BALLOT AND DON'T GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO. IMPLEMENT AND- YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S OUR FAULT BECAUSE WE SAW COMING AND DIDN'T DOLE OF THINGS ANCE BUT- PRAISE. UP I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. THE WORK. STILL STUFF. DONE ISSUE. YEAH PICKING UP THE GUN AND THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT THERE WOULD BE NICE I THINK FOR YOUR OFFICE TO PRY GIVE US A REAL SO OF PROGRESS AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE I HEAR SEVEN THOUSAND BUT I ALSO HEARD A NINE THOUSAND EARLIER AND SOME OTHER EMBERS AND THEN NUMBER COMING SO IT IF YOU. THAT JACK WHAT WHERE HOW MUCH WE DONE WHERE WILL WHAT NUMBER WHERE WE NOW HOW MUCH WAS. BASICALLY TAKEN OFF THE LIST SO WE GET A SENSE OF PROGRESS KNOWING THAT IF WE'RE FOR EVER- TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY. THAT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A LIST AND LET'S WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. AND SO I THINK MOST WAS WILL FEEL LIKE THE LIST IS GROWING WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR GROWTH IN THE NUMBER. AND THE STEM THOUSAND IS LISTED BUT- I WOULD NOT KNOW WHETHER THE NINE IN THE SEVEN TOGETHER. SIXTEEN A WHAT WELL. IN WHERE WE ARE. NICE IT ALSO THE WE GET SINCE THE OKAY WE- GOT RID OF ALL THE- AND WE- GOT ALMOST ALL THE OTHER WAS DONE THEN SO- WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE AT. EVERY YEAR I GET THE SAME WE GET THE SAME QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT. SURE MAYBE THERE'S SOME VITTLES OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP US TO SEE WHAT'S COMING IN WHAT'S GOING OUT. AND HOW MUCH PROGRESS WE HAVE OR HAVE NOT YET I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO THOSE TWO SITTING HERE. BUT THAT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TEAM FOR BEING HERE- WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE OF THE- REQUESTED TO HAVE. FOURTH AND HOPEFULLY WILL. IN TWENTY TWENTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AFTER MY COULD DOES A PRIEST ALL THE FIGHT YOU PUT IN IN DEALING WITH WASHINGTON I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET A LITTLE WE GET CONCERNED BUT- MOST OF MY FOLKS WOULD TELL YOU FIGHT ALL. HERO BECAUSE THEY FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT ARE THERE AND WE ARE IN SOME DIFFICULT TIMES SO I APPRECIATE. AND IT'S A DELICATE THING TO ANOTHER TO DEAL WITH AND- HOPEFULLY WE WILL GET GET TO A POINT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE SUCH CONTENTION BETWEEN CALIFORNIAN THE REST OF THE WORLD YOU KNOW. BUT I'M NOT THAT OPTIMISTIC BUT THANK YOU ANYWAY. OKAY I WANT TO THANK THE- AG FOR BEING HERE- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND ISSUE WHICH IS UPDATE ON CAL GETTING REGISTRY. OF IT'S A SECOND ITEM WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ELLIE OLD IT'S HERE. OKAY MADAM CHAIR ASM STAFF FROM OUR DEPARTMENT JUST AS THEY WILL PROVOKE SOME DEPARTMENT JUST IS GOING TO BE ON THE PANEL.

OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THE DO YOU MAY ISSUE- REVISED REGULATIONS ON CAL HANG UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. UP WITHIN. HAD A SIXTEEN DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. UP THOSE RIGHT. ALL REVIEWED BY THE- MINISTRY OF LAW- IF THE- IT AWAY EL APPROVES THOSE REGULATIONS- THEIR SCHEDULE TO GO INTO EFFECT. ON IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY- SO THE REGULATIONS- IF YOU'VE ALL HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THEM. TRY TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO ON STRENGTHENING. THE CRITERIA FOR ENTRY INTO THE DATABASE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- THERE IS A MUCH MORE RIGOROUS. THREE PONEN. THERE ARE ARE AUDIT MECHANISMS A DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE IN UNDER THE REGULATIONS- DOJ IF IT FINDS THAT. A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS NOT COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS- THE DOJ HAS A THREE RIGHT OF MEASURES THAT IT CAN TAKE- ONE IS TO ISSUE A LETTER UP AND THE OTHERS ARE TO. SUSPEND OR REVOKE ACCESS TO CAL KING. I SAW THAT YOU MADE REFERENCE TO. THE DAY OF. OUR LIVES THIS YEAR IT EVER A OF ARE NOW THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING A INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE CASE. ENTRIES OF BY LAPD. GIVEN THE ALLEGATIONS OF FALSIFICATION OF RECORDS. ARE WE I'M WEST PART PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN IN. TUNE WITH. OF OUR- IT'S STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES BUT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO DOING OUR OWN INDEPENDENT AUDIT- SEPARATE AND APART FROM WHATEVER LAPD IN THE POLICE COMMISSIONER DOING- THAT WILL INCLUDE NOT ONLY REVIEW OF RECORDS FROM THE METRO DIVISION- WHICH IS WHERE THESE ALLEGATIONS AROSE FROM- BUT OTHER PARTS OF LAPD AND WILL INCLUDE REVIEW OF THE IN CAMERA FOOTAGE- AT ARE THE STOCK. THE ENTRIES INTO CAL GET- WE ARE ALSO REVIEWING ALL OF THEIR PROCEDURES AND POLICIES FOR- HOW THEY ARE ADMINISTERING CAL KING- WE HAVE A RIGHT I'M OBSERVE TO THEIR RETRAINING OF OFFICERS. IT OUT CAL- ONCE REGULATIONS GOING TO AFFECT THERE WILL BE A NEW ROUND OF TRAINING AND SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO. USE OUR OBSERVATIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WENT WELL WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED THE HELP- INFORM THOSE THOSE TRAININGS AS WELL- OF COURSE- THAT'S NOT- THAT'S NOT ALL THAT WAS THAT WE MIGHT DO IF WE- FIND OUT THROUGH OUR OWN. VIEW OR WE HEAR FROM OR OR FROM THE POLICE MISSION REALLY PD- WEEK WE CAN WE WILL- TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION. ANY COMMENTS EMILIO OKAY FINE ANY MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. MANY QUESTIONS IN INCOME QUESTIONS. I THE- OKAY THANK YOU BOB ONE- WHAT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU THE OFFICE FOR TO OF FULL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE ISSUES DE AND TERMS OF THE GANG OF THE GANG LIST AND THE DATABASE THAT'S THERE AND WHAT WHAT IS DECIDED- CAN YOU. OF HOW MUCH% HAS IT HAS TE LIST CHANGED OVER THE YEARS- I MEAN- HAVE WE ACTUALLY BEEN PURGING FOLKS FROM THE LIST I GET SOME INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. SOME I'M CURIOUS IS WHAT WE'LL SEEING AT THIS OVERALL STATEWIDE LEVEL YEAH- SO. FIRST OR IS A THE REGULATIONS OF REPOSE ARE ARE NOT YET INTO A FACT I DO BELIEVE THAT ONCE THOSE REGULATIONS ARE IN EFFECT THAT WILL AFFECT- THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE OF FOLKS IN THE BASE- I WILL SAY THAT- BUT JUST. WITH MOST CRITICS I'M AWARE OF IN THE SAP TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THERE ARE ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL AND THE DEBATE AND- ABOUT THE ENTER PURGED FROM. ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND PURGED EACH YEAR RIGHT TWENTY THE ENTERED THE MEMBERSHIP CHANGES BY AND NOT THAT I MEAN TWENTY THOUSAND EITHER ENTER OR PURGED AND TO STAND FOR OKAY OKAY SO THE LIST REMAIN YEAH YEAH. I WE WERE WE IN TERMS OF THE SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WERE PASSED THAT- SAID THAT PEOPLE HAD TO BE NOTIFIED THAT THEY'RE ON THE LIST AS SOMEONE DOING THAT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT YOUNG PARENTS HAD TO BE NOTIFIED AND I KNOW IN ONE OF THE CLEARLY CITY WOULD NOT GO TO FIVE. I AM SO. UP TO NOT LOOK IS PLACED ON THE LOCAL LAUNCH AGENCIES- I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT THE TIP OF MY FINGER TIPS AS TO WHETHER OF THE ELEAZAR ARE COMPLYING WITH THOSE NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF COURSE- THE ALLEGATIONS AROUND LAPD CAME OUT BECAUSE- IT WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT. ON HER CHILD SUSPECTED NOT SO WITH ANY TOTALLY IN THAT STUDENTS THE HOME THE NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS WERE BEING COMPLIED WITH. DO YOU HAVE A- OKAY I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT IN THE IN THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT. WE WILL WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE OVERSIGHT OVER ELLIE ETS COMPLYING WITH THEIR NOTIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WAS WE TOOK A OBVIOUSLY HE GANG GET CAL GANGS OUT OF THE HANDS OF LOCAL AND PUT IT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HAVE IT. AND I'VE HEARD WE HAVE ANY. NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT OUR IDEA OF WHAT THE NET LOCALS ARE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR OWN LIST. AND I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT HAPPENING OKAY THAT WAS A RUMOR THAT OF MANY OF THE LOCAL STILL HAVE THEIR OWN LIST AND AS THE SCHOOL THEY DON'T SHARE IT BEYOND THEIR JURISDICTION THEY CAN KEEP THEIR OWN LIST. YEAH I'D I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT OF THAT HAPPENING- A I WAS AS YOU WELL KNOW FOR AB NINETY PLIES NOT ONLY TO CAL GANG BUT TO ALL SHARED DATABASES INCLUDING DATABASES AND WE HAVE REGULATIONS AS AS RIGOROUS AS THE REGULATIONS FOR AB FOR THE ANY OTHER SHARED TO GAIN DATABASE. NO SOME. THE PRESS IN SIN EL AND I WAS VERY PLEASED TO SEE YOU TAKING THE THAT THAT. I WE CONTEMPLATING IT KIND OF. ACTIONS AGAINST THOSE FOLKS WHO FOUGHT WHO FABRICATED DATA THAT WENT INTO THE GAME LIST. I MEAN WHAT I KNOW IS THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY BEING LOOKED AT- BY THE LA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MMHM- I ALSO THAT- THE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS WE SPEND AND ACTED THAT POSSIBILITY. SO I THINK WE WILL KNOW WHERE TO SEE HAPPEN WITHOUT THOSE EFFORTS BUT WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING ANY ACCIDENTS ARE AND NOT AT THIS TIME THE WAY WE'RE IN COMMUNICATION. OKAY OKAY. OKAY ANY OTHER COMMENTS YES MISS JONES SAWYER TONIGHT I WOULD LISTEN TO JUNE I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS. OF AND OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE THAT'S- PREJUDICIAL TO ANYONE OR ANY. AND BASICALLY ANY BAD OFFICERS AND- I WAS STRUCK BY YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING MORE RETRAINING AND- COULD SOME OF THIS BE AS A RESULT OF THE POLICIES. THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED. ARE WE LOOKING AT THAT VERSUS WHAT WAS TRULY IN YOUR HEART THAT SOMEONE- TRULY WANTED TO PUT SOMEONE ON A GANG LIST BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE ON THERE AS OPPOSED TO BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES IN A WAY ARE STRUCTURED WITHIN US LAW MEANT. GROUPTHAT THAT MORE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED OR COULD. IS THAT WE BY REACH I MEAN IN AND LOOKING THE- YES A RIGHT I THINK YOU'RE THE VERY GOOD POINT THAT NO SET OF POLICIES OR REGULATIONS CAN PREVENT PEOPLE FROM IF THEY REALLY WANT TO BLATANTLY FIRE FALLS I RECORDS YOU KNOW PUTTING SOMEONE IN. AS A CAL GAME DAY. ARE THE TRAINING OF. YOU KNOW WHAT WILL THE STANDARDIZED TRAINING THAT WOULD BE. REQUIRED ONCE WE- ONCE REGULATIONS ARE IN PLACE WILL INCLUDE A COMPONENT ON. THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY AND INDIVIDUALS BEING INCLUDED INTO CAL GETTING SO. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE GETTING AT. IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS. AS OPPOSED POLICIES THAT THAT'S YEAH THAT THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE TRAINING AROUND THE NEW CAL GAME RAGS FIX OUR FOR GOVERNMENT AND SOMETIMES. THE PARTICULAR POLICY. WHICH PROBABLY NOT GOOD. AND I FOLLOW I HAD TO FOLLOW THE POLICY. AND ENDED UP MAKING HUGE MISTAKES AND AS OPPOSED TO WHAT I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE JUST DONE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF POLICY PROBABLY GOT ME FIRED BUT WOULD BEEN OUT OF POLICY- AND SO I'M- JUST WONDERING EFFORT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THE POLICY. HAVE RABBIT. BUT STATEMENT IS OR EVEN BECOME PROBLEMATIC. IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP MORE SO. THAN MAYBE EVEN HEARTS AND MINDS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS GETTING AT. RIGHT ONE LAST THING UP YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK AS I STILL SEE THIS HUGE NUMBER OF EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE LIST. AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT IS. A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF ACTIVE GANG MEMBERS AND CALIFORNIA THE EIGHTY THOUSAND IT'S AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE ON A LIST. OF AND SO I KNOW ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WAS THAT WE JUST KEEP ADDING PEOPLE TO THIS LAST OR YOU KNOW FOR BECAUSE OF THE- VERY WEAK STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE FOR ADMISSION TO THE LIVE. ADDITIONAL NOT CONSISTENTLY GROUPS OTHER THAN BLACK AND I'M GROUPS THAT ARE ON THIS LIST ARE THERE ANY SKINHEADS CONSIDERED GANG MEMBERS ON THIS LIST OF I KNOW OF ONE POINT SOMEONE TOLD ME AND ON SENATOR COUNTY SAID NO AND A LOT OF THEM IN SAID COUNTY SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO HAVE WE DONE MUCH TO AT LEAST. BREAK THIS SITE GANG MEMBER HAS BLACK. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE THE ALL WITHIN CAL GANG THERE ARE MEMBERS OF WHITE SUPREMACIST RIGHT SUPPORT THE GROUPS THAT ARE THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS GANGS. OKAY WILL BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE NUMBERS. IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE THIS THERE. YEAH IF WE LOSE OVER REPRESENTED BUT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ARE IN OUR OUR FOCUS ON ON GAINES IS OFTEN BEEN THOSE TWO GROUPS AND YET WE IGNORE A LOT OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT RESULT IN HATE CRIME. AND INJURY TO PEOPLE THAT THAT. WE LOOK AT JUST THE BEHAVIOR WITHOUT THE FACES WOULD INDICATE THAT THIS IS A KIND OF A- GANG MOB MENTALITY. THAT IS EXISTING AND YET WE DON'T REALLY HAVE. LEAST MIGHT WHEN I ASKED MY FOLKS IN SAN DIEGO THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE A LIST. OF ALL OF THE SKINHEADS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS LIKE THAT IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA. AND THEY MAY HAVE A NO ONE NEED KNOW ABOUT IT BUT THE HEY. THEY TO CLAIM THEY DON'T HAVE ONE AND SO THAT'S KIND OF A- A NARROW PERSPECTIVE OF GANG ACTIVITY- ESPECIALLY SINCE THOSE GANGS OFTENTIMES. VIOLENCE AND THE KIND. OF THE BEHAVIOR PRETTY. A DRAMATIC. KAY THANK YOU WE HAVE A HEAR PUBLIC COMMENTS OF FOLKS WITH A CONCERNING THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. ITEM TWO. LIST LIMIT YOU TO ONE MINUTE TO A COMMENT TO MAKE- ONE MINUTE. WE HAVE THREE PEOPLE WHO DECIDED THIS. ONCE WOULD FORM THE LIST. DON'T PEOPLE PLEASE DON'T KEEP ADDING TO THE LIST IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK. ARE NOW IS YOUR MOMENT TO GET IN LINE WE HAVE ONE PERSON ANYONE ELSE. THIS HERE TO CONCERNING THE GANG LIST. ANYONE ELSE. IF YOU IN LINE AND THAT THIS. OKAY THE LAST PERSON I SEE IN LINE IS A GENTLEMAN WITH A- WHY IT HAD ON. OR IS IT THE BLACK CAT WHICH ONE WAIT AT THE END ALL RIGHT WHITE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE LAST THIS THE LAST PERSON IN THIS LINE OKAY SO THOSE ARE THE FOLKS LISTENING TO FOR ONE MINUTE THANK YOU YES. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAN AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE OF LA. I DON'T AGREE WITH THE CALIFORNIA AGAIN DATABASE BECAUSE IT IS JUST A WAY TO TARGET PEOPLE PEOPLE. SIMPLY BY THE WAY THEY LEAD THEY DRESS OR WHERE THEY READ RECITE. COM WHY DO YOU SEE HAVE THE FREE LEGAL CLINIC ARE WE COAST EVERY SECOND FOR SATURDAY OF THE MONTH. AND WE HAVE HAD- HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE COMING AND FOR MY COMMUNITY- ASKING TO BE REMOVED AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM TO BE REMOVED FROM THIS CAN BE BASS. AND WE HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF STORIES OF HOW THIS IS A FACT IN PEOPLE'S LIVES. I WANT TO GIVE UP PERSONAL- STORY FROM MY NEIGHBOR ARM HE WAS PUT ON THE GAME DATA BASE WHEN HE WAS ELEVEN- HE DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS IN THE GANG DATABASE ON ONE TIME HE WAS STOPPED. FOR A TRAFFIC XIN THAT'S WHERE HE FOUND EVERYTHING TOTALLY ESCALATED. OUR IN. HERE HE HAD NEVER COMMITTED ANY CRIME JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE WHERE HE LIVED ADAM THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE GAME DATABASE IS AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES THANK. WHO GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR WEBER AND THE COMMITTEE ON MY NAME'S KEN MCGILL FROM YOUTH JUSTICE COALITION WE WERE SPONSORS OF SENATE BILL FOUR FIFTY EIGHT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO NINETY EIGHT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETY AND THE STATE AUDIT THAT REVEALED A LOT OF THE INACCURACIES AND PROBLEMS WITH THE DATABASE I HAVE TO SAY AFTER WORKING WITH DOCTOR WEAPON OTHER. TO CHECK THIS IS YOUNG PEOPLE AND YOUNG ADULTS ARE FIXING IN TERMS OF GETTING OUT OF WERE AT A PLACE NOW IS HUGE AS COALITION THAT WE BELIEVE THE ENTIRE SHARE DATABASE ESTAMOS WILL CAN AND SHOULD BE SHUT. THE DEPARTMENT OF ARGUE THAT THEY HAD HAD A BALANCED APPROACH TO IT. THE REGULATIONS BUT WE SAW THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE PROCESS. THE COMMUNITY WOULD COME IN WITH VALID CONCERNS. THE REGULATIONS WOULD BE SLIGHTLY ALTERED AND THEN BY TIME LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. GET A SENSE WOULD BE BACK. IN MOST OF US HAVE- AGREED THAT NOW THE RIGHT TIONS ARE EVEN WEAKER. FOR AB NINETY WAS PASSED WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE REGULATIONS PROCESS FOLLOW THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW. WE URGE IF THE DATABASE IS NOT MERELY SHUT DOWN. THERE AT THE VERY LEAST IT SHOULD BE TWO YEARS AND NOT FROM. PURCHASE ALL THE- SUGGEST THAT. WOULD LINK. PERCENT IS GETTING INVOLVED IS INVOLVED. IS BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEARS. THAT YOU HAVE TO REQUIRE PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A STOP. NOT REASONABLE SUSPICION WHICH IS TOO WEAK OF A STANDARD. THAT WE HAVE TO THAT THE DATABASE CONTINUES TO BE VAGUE AN OVERLY BROAD IN TERMS OF CRITERIA. THAT ASSOCIATION- SCENE AND A GANG- ADDRESS OR LOCATION. AND SEEN WEARING GANG A TIRE OR STYLE OF DRESS. TIED TO SPECIFIC GANG IS TO BROUGHT. ON THAT YOU HAVE TO ELIMINATE GANG. HITS AS A CLASSIFICATION. OF OVERLY BROAD AND BRINGS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE- ARE NOT GETTING INVOLVED. I'M SELF ADMISSION IS SO OFTEN INCRIMINATING AND RIDICULOUS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE TO BE THE MOST LOGICAL THING TO GO BY BUT SO OFTEN PEOPLE ARE EITHER TRYING TO CREATE A REPUTATION OR COURSE IN THE SAME THING SO I WOULD REQUIRE. ON THAT THAT RIGHT TO BE LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY. ON THREE BEING ARRESTED FOR AN OFFENSE CONSISTENT WITH GANG ACTIVITY IS ALSO INCLUDES THINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE GANG BECAUSE- THE STEP BACK HAS SO MANY OFFENSES THAT. PRETTY MUCH COVERS THE NOT NOT GOING TO SAY COVERS THE WHOLE PENAL CODE BUT IT'S A VERY EXTENSIVE LIST. SO SHOULD COME WITH AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT YES OKAY WE'VE GOT ALL YOU RENT DACIANS AND OTHERWISE WE- WILL GET YOU WILL GET A CHANCE TO TALK I APPRECIATE THAT.

IT'S MOVING NOW TO THE ITEM THREE. OF WHICH IS THE OUT OF THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING AND ASSOCIATED BUDGET CHANGE PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. A STATE AUDITOR'S WANTS TO GO FIRST OKAY ON ISSUE ITEM NUMBER THREE. TO GET A CHANCE WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER TWO YEARS SOMEONE. TWO FOUR. OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON NOT CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARK RUN OR DO WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I WAS THE SUPERVISOR ON THE TEANECK UP TO THE AUDIT RELEASED IN MAY LAST YEAR I'VE BEEN OUT TODAY TO PROVIDE BRIEF REMARKS THE KEY OF OUR OP AT. BUREAU CAMPING CONTROL AS WELL AS AN UPDATE ON THE RECOMMENDATION STATUS. AND FINALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THOSE TWO THINGS- A SUMMARY OF OUR OUR BRIEF REVIEW OF THE- BUDGET ITEMS BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY SO. ARE FOR WITH ISSUED IN MAY OF LAST. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE UNIFIED ISSUE WITH THE- EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LICENSING REVIEW PROCESS. FOR GAMBLING APPLICANTS. HE GAME. ROLL PACIFIC WE FIGHT THAT THE- HAD NOT. MADE EFFICIENT USE OF THE TWO. TERM POSITIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD PROVIDED IT. IN ORDER TO CLEAR A BACKLOG IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER THE CASE PROCESS PER FULL TIME. MY SINCE ISSUE. THE FISH DECLINED EACH YEAR. THIS CLEARS FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I A RESULT OF THOSE EFFICIENCY PROBLEMS ARE WE DETERMINED THAT IT HAD MADE ONLY LIMITED PROGRESS IN CLEARING ITS BACK OF APPLICATIONS. WHICH PAINT AT ABOUT ONE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS. I'M OF OUR IF YOU. IN TERMS OF THE COST IS FOR SHOES WE FOUND OUT FLAWS AND INCONSISTENCIES IN THE GIRLS LICENSING PROCESS THESE ARE THESE INCLUDE INEFFICIENCIES AND HOW THEY PROCESS INCOMING APPLICATIONS. ARE INCONSISTENT PROCEDURES FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSE APPLICANTS AND SOME FLOOD OVERSIGHT OF SYNCING STAFF SPEND THEIR TIME. AND OF THE MANDATE WE MADE THE- AT SIX MY AND KERN AS OF TODAY THE BILL HAS MADE PROGRESS IN IMPLEMENTING SOME OF OUR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY IT HAS FULLY OR PARTIALLY IN. NINE OF THE THIRTEEN RECOMMENDATION. I DO A COPY AT THAT BY SAYING. SOME OF THESE CHANGES THAT THE BUREAU HAS MADE SOME THE INTERVENTIONS ARE QUITE RECENT. BRIGUS PULL IT UP. SOME LICENSING PROCESS. IT'S TIME OUR TIME REPORTING OVER PROCEDURES AS RECENTLY AS A PERSON EXCUSE ME AS RECENTLY AS LATE OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND AS A- NOT SUFFICIENT TIME TO A- AN MEASURE THE AFFECT EFFICIENCY GAINS THAT DOESN'T BUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE INTENDED TO ACHIEVE. IN TERMS OF THE TIMES BEFORE YOU TODAY. STARTING WITH THE REGULATORY- ITEM FIRST ALTHOUGH THAT ITEM MENTIONS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND ITS JUSTIFICATION. THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN QUESTION ARE NOT MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE BODY OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSAL AND SO I'M UNABLE TO SPEAK TO TYPICALLY WHICH RECOMMENDATION. ARE THE DEPARTMENT IS IT AS SIMPLE WITH THOSE POSITIONS ARMED. WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER ITEM THE LINK TO OUR SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE EFFICIENCY OF THE PROCESS ARE MORE AND MORE CLEAR I'M HOWEVER I WOULD MAKE TWO ONE IS THAT. THE ACT THAT THE HAS IDENTIFIED FOR THESE NEW POSITIONS IN TERM INTAKE OUR ACTIVITIES THAT WERE ALREADY IN PLACE TIME OF OUR IF. NOT MANDATE. THE NOT FROM WHAT TIME BRING IN. AND TIME NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT TO US WHY IMPLEMENTING A DRUG. WERE NECESSARY INC INCLUDING THAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STAFF AT THE AT THE FEAR OF. THE OTHER THING THAT I. JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THAT- ALTHOUGH THE BUREAU HAS MADE PROGRESS IN SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. SOME OF THOSE PROCESSES ARE ONGOING. BEING A TIME STUDY. STUDY THAT WE DIRECTED THE BUREAU TO PARTICIPATING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE GAMING CONTROL COMMISSION TO REALLY ASSESS HOW IT'S- IN THEIR TIME HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO COST LONG TERM. AND HOW TO INSERT AS HOW TO SET UP THINGS LIKE- APPLICATION- DEPOSIT RATES GOING FOR WHICH IS A SEPARATE ISSUE BUT- ALL BEING SAID. IT APPEARS TO US THAT. ORTON ABOUT IN INCREASING EFFICIENCY GOING ON RIGHT NOW THE BUREAU SO. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. NOTHING CERTAINLY SEVEN. ONE HI MY NAME'S. THANK MEMBERS. THANK YOU YEP SHOULD BE ON YOUR OKAY BEYOND THAT HI MY NAME IS STEPHANIE SMILES I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU FAMILY CONTROL- THINK THE OUTER IN BRINGING UP YOU KNOW THE UPDATE WE ARE VERY PROUD WE OF FULLY MEND HIS OF THOSE RIGHT STATIONS YOU HAVE MADE A WE WERE DILIGENTLY TO. TIGHTEN UP ALL FEATURES TO MAKE SURE WE ARE MORE EFFICIENT AT THE ISSUE THE ARM ON RIGHT TOWARD TENSION I'M. JUST TO COMMENT. REALLY THE ON THE B. C. PIECE THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU- IN THE AUDIT THE STATE OUT OF RECOMMENDED THE BTC ANALYZE ITS INVESTIGATION PROCESSES AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURAL CHANGES TO IMPROVE ITS TIMELINESS AND PROCESSING UP. SO LATE THEY HAD REALLY CONNECTION WITH SOMETHING SAYS AND WE DID I'M- LOOK AT THE RECORD. IN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. WITH RESPECT TO THE SIXTEENTH SECTION. BUT TO BE CLEAR THE LIGHTS PROCESS ISN'T SOLELY ON THE BILL THE LIGHTS SUCH THAT THEY DO COORDINATE AND WORK EVERY DAY WITH IN THE VISUALS OF THE COMPLAINTS ENFORCEMENT SECTION AS WELL AS THE AUDIT SECTION SAID THEY WERE COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER. WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO- INSTILL THAT WITH OUR EMPLOYEES THAT THEY NEED TO BE TALKING TO WORKING TOGETHER. SO WHEN REVIEWING DELAYS THAT- THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING THE BACKLOG WE TOOK IT A STEP FURTHER AND THEN LOOKED AT THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND HOW THE INDIVIDUALS WORK TOGETHER. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ARE SPECIAL AGENTS OUR FIELD REPRESENTATIVES AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE AUDITOR'S. OFTEN WORK IN MORE OF A REACTIVE MANNER. SO STAFF IN THESE ROLES- THE RESPONSE REQUEST FROM LICENSING. THEY INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND THEY ALSO RESPONSE REQUEST FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY ALSO CONDUCTS SITE INSPECTIONS AND FINANCE FOR IS REVIEWS EVERY TWO YEARS AS THE LICENSE RENEWAL PROCESS COMES UP SO LICENSES ONCE ARE ISSUED EVERY TWO YEARS THEY COME UP FOR RENEWAL. AND DURING THAT TIME RIGHT BEFORE OR- RIGHT BEFORE THE BEFORE THE LICENSING PROCESS. FIELD REPS AGENTS DO INSPECTIONS THE AUDITOR'S DEAL FINANCIALLY VALUATIONS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS BECAUSE WE FOLLOW WITH CYCLES SOMETIMES ISSUES FOUND. IT TAKES TIME SO WE HAVE TO INVEST EIGHT AND WHAT IT DOES IS THE LAYS THE RENEWAL PROCESS AND THE RULES ARE OUR PRIORITY- WITHOUT THOSE- LIKE THIS IS A PLACE PEOPLE CAN OPERATE THEY CAN'T WORK SO THAT WAS OUR OLD THE FIRST THING. TO GET OUT THE DOOR. AS LIKE TO. WAS IN. HE DOES POSE IT. ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. WHICH IS THE BACK THAT WE'VE TRYING TO ADDRESS. I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT WE MADE REALLY GREAT SONG THE BACKLOG- AS THE OTHER SAID WE ARE STILL IMPLEMENTING PROBLEM POLCIES WE ARE INVITING AS WE GO ALONG WE SEE ISSUES BECAUSE WE REALIZE IT'S KIND OF THE- ONGOING PROCESS. I'M AS ANY JOURNAL MENTIONED- WE GET THE NUMBERS BACK IN MARCH THIRTY FIRST AND INCLUDED THOSE NUMBERS IN THE INITIAL RESPONSE OUT OF HER. THOSE AT THE BACKLOG WAS ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IF WE LOOK AT FAST FORWARD TO TODAY OF THOSE NUMBERS A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE LEFT. AND AGAIN AS THINGS ROLLING THE- WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM SO IT'S NOT. GETTING RID OF THOSE THAT ARE OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BACKLOG IS IF IT'S IN THE BUREAU FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS WE CONSIDER A BACKLOG SO IS TRYING TO REMOVE THOSE OLD CASES BUT ALSO THAN KEEPING THE NEW ONES FROM ROLLING INTO THE- WE LOOK AT. ALL CURRENTLY. OF OUR PENNY LICENSES WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY IN HOUSE THAT ARE OVER SIX MONTHS OLD SO. WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE THERE A LITTLE WORKING TOWARDS THAT BUT WE'VE BEEN MAKING REALLY GOOD PROGRESS THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WERE PROUD OF. SO THE- ONE B. C. P. WITH THE- THE REGULATORY THE LARGER BCP. IT IS TO HIRE MORE SPECIAL AGENTS MORE FIELD REPS- MORE INVESTIGATIVE AUDITORS SO WE ARE DOING MORE ROUTINE- REVIEWS SO. NOT JUST ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS BUT YOU'RE IN THERE EVERY MONTH OR YOU'RE IN THERE EVERY QUARTER. LEAD TO ASSIST WITH THE LICENSING PROCESS BUT TO WORK WITH THE LICENSEES SO IF THAT WE SEE PROBLEMS WE CAN DRESS THEM PROACTIVELY GET PEOPLE BACK ON TRACK AND NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES COME UP AT THE END OF THE LICENSING PERIOD. SO ANALYSTS VIEW UNIT. THE US THAT UNIT CURRENTLY LOOKS A GAME APPROVAL DOCUMENTS THIS IS FOR A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF RESPONSIBILITIES WE WOULD LIKE THOSE GAME ANALYST THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN THE RULES OF THE GAME THAT WE APPROVED TO BE ACTIVELY OUT THERE GOING OUT INSPECTING WORKING SPECIAL AGENTS WORKING FIELD REPS- SINCE THE EXPERTISE ON ALL OF THE ACTUAL RULES OF THE GAMES ARE BEING PLAYED- IN THE CARD ROOM SO IT IS DIFFERENT- THE REST. TO OF THE BETWEEN TO HELP WITH THE WORK LOAD TO ENSURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT TO THE INDUSTRY IS CONSISTENT LEGALLY SOUND A LOT OF THOSE- HISTORY REPRESENTATIVES BRING IT ARNE'S HOME LIKE TO BE A PART BE A LOOK SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS NOW WE DO THINK THAT THE ADDITIONAL ADVISORY TO THE COME TO END INTO A- SEE THE LET THE NOSE AND ADDRESS THEM AND ALSO PROBABLY SOME MORE REGULATIONS TO TYPE THING. I WAS UP. POSITIONS HELPFUL FOR THOSE. ONE FINAL. YEAH I NEED ONLY WITH THE LARGEST ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE COME ON BCP'S WILL START WITH THE LICENSING ONE- ON THE LICENSING ONE WE ARE RECOMMENDING- REJECTING THE PROPOSAL FOR BEING PREMATURE FOR TWO REASONS- THE FIRST THREE IN IS A CONCERN THAT IS SHARED BY THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF A NUMBER CONCEIT AND PROCEDURAL JAZZ IN SAID HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENT QUITE RECENTLY AND SO THE FULL IMPACT OF THOSE CHANGES ARE UNKNOWN. AND FOR THE LETTER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL ONGOING RESOURCES THE FULL IMPACT REALLY SHOULD BE MEASURED AND CAPTURED THE SECOND IS RELATED TO THAT IS THAT THESE REQUESTS FOR NOT ANALYST POSITION INS SHOULD WE BE CONSIDERED CONCUR ME THE- FOR PERMANENT ANIL. JULY COMING DE BECAUSE- FOR THE EXPIRE. AND THE REASON FOR THE IS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE SHIFTING INTO THESE NON ANALYST POSITIONS WOULD OTHERWISE BE DONE BY THE ANALYSTS. AND SO THEY REALLY SHOULD BE TAKEN AND HOLE IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE TOTAL LEVEL OF RESOURCES. AND THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF STAFF THAT ARE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR THE OVERSIGHT PCP WE ARE RECOMMENDING MODIFYING THAT PROPOSAL- BY NOT APPROVING THREE OF THE THIRTY POSITIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THAT BCP WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE A UP- AN ISSUE WITH THE PROACTIVE APPROACH. RELATED TO THE SPECIAL AGENTS IN THE GAME IN EXETER. THE THREE POSITIONS IN QUESTION ARE RELATED TO THE IN HOUSE LEGAL RESOURCES- AND SO THESE WOULD BE POSITIONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING REVIEWING. THE WARNING LETTERS SITTING IN ON MEETINGS WITH- LICENSEE ATTORNEYS ETCETERA. AND WE HAVE THIS RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE WE GENERALLY FIND OTHER ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DEALING WITH THAT WORKLOAD FOR EXAMPLE. INCREASED TRAINING FOR IT LESS THAN THEIR SUPERVISORS COULD BE USED TO ENSURE THAT LETTERS ISSUED IN BOTH AN APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT LEGALLY SOUND WAY. CAN YOU COME IN I'M SURE I DIDN'T ADDRESS I ONLY JUST ONE OF THE BC PIECE OF A MAKES BIG BRIEFLY TO THE LICENSING SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO WE DO UNDERSTAND YES WE WILL BE COMING BEFORE YOU NEXT YEAR WITH THE B. C. P. FOR PERMANENT FUNDING FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO OR SOME. NUMBER OF THOSE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS SO JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS. IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THAT ONE. AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR THINGS THERE ARE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR'S SUGGEST. THAT THE NEW DUTIES THAT THE INTAKE UNIT HOUSE CHIU DOING LETTERS. DOING IMOGENE AND PUTTING THINGS IN THE DATABASE SO WE THINK THERE'S ALREADY CURRENTLY WORK LOW. WHO WOULD ALSO KNOW THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT MORE NON ANALYST'S DUTIES TO THAT UNIT- TO THE CAN BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT. WE DON'T WANT THE ANALYST- BE. THE ONE THE CONSTRAINED. INVESTIGATIONS OF THERE ARE THINGS THAT OTHER OF LOWER. CLERICAL SUPPORT LEVEL TYPE OF POSITIONS CAN DO WE THINK THAT'S AN EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THE ANALYSTS ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO ALSO IN THE LICENSING SECTION- THERE IS NO SUPPORT STAFF SEWER ASKING FOR A COUPLE OF OFFICE TECHNICIANS FOR THOSE TWO UNITS. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE EITHER ANALYSTS OR MANAGERS HAVING TO HAVE SENT OUT LETTERS AND DOING COPYING THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE BALL ROLLING TO MAKE SURE THE AND LET'S GET THE WORK DONE AND THE MANAGERS ARE ABLE TO REVIEW IT AND GET IT DONE SO WE HAD IDENTIFIED THINGS THAT WE THINK WILL MAKE US MORE. EFFICIENT IN A SURE THAT- WE ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND ALSO THAT WE DON'T BACKSLIDE INTO DOESN'T COME BACK. THE QUESTION. YEAH OKAY. THANKS VENTURA I JUST OPENED IT JUST ASK THE AUDITOR TO ADDRESS THE- ITEM IN THE AGENDA THAT TALKED ABOUT. AND THE TEAM'S FINDINGS REGARDING P. EFFICIENCY OF THE ORGANIZATION- OBVIOUSLY THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS. SINCE THE DEPARTMENT HAS SHOWN- INEFFICIENCY WITH THE APPROPRIATION WE DID AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO FURTHER APPROPRIATION NOT US IF LA HAS A COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. SO IN TERMS OF OUR FINDING- AS I SUMMARIZED- THIS IS THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT THOSE POSITIONS HAD MARKEDLY DECREASING IN IMPACT ON ON THE CASELOAD AT THE BILL WHICH RAISE CONCERNS FOR US BECAUSE THEY WERE REQUESTED. UNDER THE AUSPICES OF CLEARING THAT BACKLOG. EQUALLY CONCERNING TO US IS YOU WOULD READ IN OUR REPORT IS THAT. ON THE PIER WASN'T REALLY ABLE TO PROVIDE A CONVINCING OCCUR HERE AT REASON AS TO WHY THAT DECREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY OR EFFICIENCY WAS OCCURRING- THERE ARE REFERENCES TO DIFFERENT POOLS OF APPLICANTS TAKING A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF TIME- HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CASE LOAD AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF IT THAT. WASN'T REALLY. LINKS CLEARLY TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WERE SEEING I'M SO THEY DID SEEM TO THE PROBLEMS DID SEEM TO BE INSOFAR AS WE CAN DIAGNOSE THEM TO BE PROCEDURAL IN TERMS OF. ANALYZING THE COMPLETENESS OF APPLICATIONS AS THEY COME IN THE DOOR AS OPPOSED TO WAITING FOR ANALYSTS TO DO IT LATER. ON SOME OF THE OTHER. CLERICAL QUOTE UNQUOTE TYPE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS REFERRING TO NOW. AGAIN I WOULD JUST REITERATE FROM A FROM A RESOURCE PERSPECTIVE. ARE FINDING WAS THAT WAITING TO DO THOSE THINGS- ACTUALLY MADE THEM TAKE LONGER BECAUSE GETTING IN TOUCH WITH SOMEONE WHAT SUBMITTED AN INCOMPLETE APPLICATION YEARS PRIOR. WAS A MORE TIME SINGING ACTIVITY FOR THE ANALYST ASSIGNED THANK YOU TO DO SO COMING IN THE DOOR. INTO THE REFERENCE TO THINGS LIKE LETTERS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SENT OUT. THOSE ARE REQUIRED BY BY LAW SO- I WILL AGAIN WOULD SAY THAT THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS PLACED ON ON THE BUREAU- SO ALL TOLD I JUST REITERATE THAT. I'M GIVEN OUR OUR FINDINGS GIVEN OUR- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE UTILIZATION OF THIRTY TWO POSITIONS. I DON'T SEE A CLEAR LINK BETWEEN- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS BARRING SOME ADDITIONAL. DATA THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU SIR I DON'T HAVE THE OTHER RUN FOR ME BUT WHAT WHICH RECOMMENDATION THAN. SELF IF NOT NEW POSITIONS WITH THE RECORD. FROM THE RECOGNITION OF THE BACK WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE- POSITIONS WE RECOMMENDED THAT THEY EXTEND THAT WOMEN ARE NOT IN. TWO YEARS. TO ALLOW THE PROTON COMMON OUR MANDATE THEM BUT WE HOPE WILL. AGAIN XIN C. M. BIG KNOWLEDGE THE REPORT WE BELIEVE THAT SO NUMBER OF THOSE TWO BIT. ARE WARRANT ON AN ONGOING DUE TO A- WILLIAM SINCE THEY WERE FIRST OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER WE DON'T. GET TO OF. THIRTY TO A STOP OF HISTORICAL. IN YOUR AUDIT OF THE OF THE BEER TO JEFF ANY. THOUGHTS ABOUT THE QUESTION I RAISED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHETHER WHETHER REALLY MADE SENSE. TO HAVE BOTH. ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS LICENSING FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER THE DUTCH REALLY BE SEPARATE. NO THAT WAS NOTHING THAT WE LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY AND IN FACT THAT. ARE THE MAJORITY OF OUR OF OUR FINDINGS OUR FOCUS WAS IN FACT ON ON THE LICENSING SIDE WHICH HAS- AS I SAID NGUYEN IT'S MY PLACE TO SPEAK TO THE REQUEST FOR THE ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS. CANNELLA JIM DID YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE- THOUGHT OF FINDINGS- IN TERMS OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS- WE- THIS ISSUE HAS POPPED UP NUMEROUS YEARS THROUGH CONFERENCE COMMITTEE EXCITER AND IT'S BEEN A PERSISTENT PROBLEM. AND SO THE ISSUES OF THE DECLINING PRODUCTIVITY WERE CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF- SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE LICENSING BECAUSE IT- NON ANALYTICAL POSITIONS. IN PARTICULAR YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS AND HOLE. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND SOME OF THAT INVOLVES THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED ON EACH PARTICULAR APPLICATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU'RE BACKLOG IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT YOU MIGHT BE DOING CERTAIN THINGS TO GET IT DONE AND GET IT OUT OF THE WAY. BUT THEN MOVING FORWARD ON AN ONGOING BASIS THE PROCESS MIGHT LOOK SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND REQUIRE. A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF RESOURCES AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING- CONSIDERING IT IN HORRIBLE AT PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET LIKELY BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FEEDBACK I'M JUST REALLY QUICKLY IN TERMS OF THE M. KIND OF HAVING THE ENFORCEMENT A LICENSING TOGETHER I JUST WANT TO REITERATE KIND OF WHAT THE- CAN MOTIVATE MOTIVATED US WITH ONE OF THOSE BCP'S IS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR ENFORCEMENT OUR INVESTIGATIVE AUDITOR'S IN THE LICENSING SECTION BECAUSE THEY DO RELY ON ONE ANOTHER IN THEY WORK COLLECTIVELY TO THAT. MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE ARE. GET ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY ATION AGAINST THEM SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I DO I DO WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT SOME FOLKS THINK WE'RE KIND OF SILO TO- AND WHILE THEY DO HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES THEY DO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER SO IT THINK THAT IS ONE THING. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES AND ONE PLACE- ESPECIALLY FOR MELINDA MISTREATED ISSUES TO THEY KIND OF OVERLAP AND WORK HAND IN HAND TOGETHER. YEAH AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A- COMMENT I THINK IF YOU IF YOU TALK TO SOME OF THE- PUMP ESTABLISHMENT TO COME IN FOR LICENSING. THEIR THEIR FEEDBACK TO- TO US HAS BEEN THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE SORT OF. TREATED LIKE CRIMINALS. THAT THEY- ARE ARE TREATED- AS IF THEY'RE GUILTY UNETHICAL PROVE THEIR- THEIR INNOCENCE THROUGH THAT LICENSING. PROCESS I THINK AND I THINK JUST THE WAY I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT IS. IF WE PUT IN I MENTION THIS WHEN THE TORNADO CAME. IF WE PUT. THE CANNABIS LICENSE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I THINK WE HAVE. ALMOST ZERO PARTICIPATION JUST BECAUSE OF THAT POTENTIAL FEAR. ON THE SO I JUST CURIOUS HOW HOW YOU FELT ABOUT THAT CUTURE IF YOU'VE HEARD THAT. SORT OF FEEDBACK IF YOU HAD HEARD. ON THAT CONCERN FOR MANY OF THE LICENSEES THAT HAVE THROW YEAH OVER THE YEARS I THINK I'VE ONLY BEEN THIS POSITION FOR TWO YEARS BUT- I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY AND I'VE I'VE HEARD BOTH I'VE HEARD THANKS FOR NOT TREAT US LIKE CRIMINALS I'VE HEARD BY HE TREATMENTS LIKE CRIMINALS. AND I WILL SAY THAT WE TRIED TO BE REALLY- OBJECTIVE WHEN A LICENSING APPLICATION COMES AND WE HAVE SPECIFIC- AND SO WE ASK AND WE DO FOLLOW UP FOR INFORMATION- I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS KIND OF A- IS A WORKLOAD FOR PEOPLE AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE OTHER BUSINESSES OF THEY'RE RUNNING BUT WE- IT'S- THE REGULATED ENGINE. INDUSTRY FOR GOOD REASON AND I THINK THAT- ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASK AND ALL THE INFORMATION WE GET I MEAN AT LEAST AS TO WHERE WE CAN MAKE A GOOD RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMISSION US EXCELLENCE LET IT'S AN NOT. PRICE PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR THE REGULATION. ALSO WHO ARE CONCERNED OF THAT. THAT THEY'RE DOING THE- DEPARTMENT TREAT. TO ESTABLISHED UNFAIR. UNEQUAL SO THAT SEEMS BE CO NOT SINCE THE- CA. WITH MY FEEDBACK AS WELL. I WILL SAY THAT. WE HAD LOOKED AT REALLY HARD OUR PROCESS IS WHEN THE AUDIT REPORT CAME OUT IN TERMS OF- ARE WE TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY ARE THEY HAVING DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES SO WE'VE BEEN- REALLY HONING IN ON MAKING SURE THAT. NO ONE GETS SPECIAL TREATMENT YOU KNOW AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE ALWAYS GO TO THAT ONE PEOPLE AFTER SOMETHING IT'S LIKE. NO WE'RE TREATING EVERYONE THE SAME AND I THINK WE HAD BEFORE BUT REALLY SPEAKING IT OUT LOUD NOW THAT'S NO YOU DON'T GET BUT LINE FOR SOME. NO YOU DON'T- WE DON'T GET I'M HAVE CERTAIN SPECIAL. INTERESTS THINGS LIKE THAT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WELL WE'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT WE HAVE BEEN- OBJECTIVE AND TRY TO TREAT EVERYONE FAIRLY UP. UNDER THE PERCENT. OR TRYING TO MAKE. CERTAINLY ALL OF US IN RURAL THAT ALSO THE INDUSTRY KNOWS THAT TO. SHOWING YOUR TEARS YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT'S BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'VE- TREATED PEOPLE. BUT BASS AND NOT LOOK BACK TREAT TREAT PEOPLE UNFAIRLY. I DON'T BELIEVE SO. AND HISTORICALLY BEFORE YOU GOT THERE WOULD YOU WOULD YOU. I BELIEVE THAT OUR BELIEF IS THAT THERE'S ANY SORT OF UNFAIR. UNEQUAL TREATMENT NOT A NO I AM. JUST HELP ME I HAD BEEN ON THE GALA CONTROL COMMISSION FOR SIX YEARS PRIOR TO THIS I DID IT. AT THE STATE IN ANOTHER STATE AGENCY BETWEEN BUT- AS AS KIND OF I GUESS AN OUTSIDER- WHEN I VIEW THE BUREAU I DID NOT FIND THAT I DID NOT HAVE THAT CONCERN THAT THEY WERE TREATING PEOPLE- UNFAIRLY. CERTAINLY WE GIVE- RECOMMENDATIONS PEOPLE DON'T LIKE AND- WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM AND IF WE DON'T THE COMMISSION WELL THEN FIND A DIFFERENT. MAKE DIFFERENT VERSIONS SO WE'RE ALWAYS- I THINK IT'S VERY TRUE. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW ORDER. THIS IN SOME WE GIVE. THE THIRTY TWO LIMITED- TO YOUR POSITIONS FOR LICENSING WHY WHY THE NEED FOR MORE. WELL SO THESE ARE I MEAN THOSE ARE JUST STRICTLY FOR THE ANALYTICAL POSITIONS THERE THE SSA NAY GPA LEVEL THE- THE REQUESTED WE HAD FOR THE- FOR THE I BELIEVE IT EIGHT POSITIONS IS STRICTLY FOR THE NON ANALYTICAL TO SUPPORT WORK THINGS SAID WE WANT TO WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T WANT THE ANALYSTS TO DO TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE IMPORTANT BUT THEY'RE DOING. AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE MORE ROUTINE THE YOU KNOW IF USE SETTING UP FILES AND SENATE REVIEWING SENDING OUT LETTERS AND DOING ALL THOSE THINGS THE WORKLOAD IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS COME IT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THOSE THINGS FOR THESE- APPLICATION SO WHAT DOES THE ANALYSTS. THEIR WORKLOAD TO PAY ON OF TYPE OF THIS HAVE HOW DO IT WITH THE SEARCH ARE WITH THE WITH THAT WE COULD THIS IS PARCEL OUT BECAUSE IT IS CORRECT I'M GOING WORKLOAD FOR IS GOING PRES NOT GONNA WAIT WHAT. OLDER WORKERS. IT IS THE ONE WHY DO YOU THINK THE AUDITOR FOUND ON A LACK OF EFFICIENCY WITH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE STAFF YEAH I THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEIR BELIEF IS THAT. THERE MAY NOT BE A NEED FOR ANY MORE STAFF WHICH I ALWAYS LIKE TO HEAR. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING. DO A HARD LOOK AT WHAT OUT OF THOSE THIRTY TWO WE NEED TO COME BACK TO YOU FOR NEXT YEAR. I MEAN WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GAINING EFFICIENCIES AND WE'RE GOING WE KNOW WE HAVE TO JUSTIFY THOSE POSITIONS SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE WILL BE COMING BACK TO NEXT YEAR TO DO. SO IT'S NOT AN INCREASE RIGHT NOW IN THOSE THIRTY TWO ON THE ANALYTICAL POSITIONS THIS IS KIND OF A- A NEW WORKLOAD THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING AND I SHOULDN'T SAY NEW WORKLOAD BECAUSE IT THE ART WE ARE DOING SOME OF THAT RIGHT NOW. IT HAS INCREASED SINCE WE IMPLEMENTED SOME THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE THINK IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AGAIN TO KEEP US ON TRACK. MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN GET THOSE CASES DOT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE. A LIVER ANALYSTS DOING- DUTIES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. THE AUDITOR HAVE POINTED OUT THERE WAS. HELLO OF NON CASE WORK WHICH IS WORK THAT THE AUDITOR I'M SORRY THE ANALYSTS HAVE TO DO BUT THEY WEREN'T SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO- A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION THEY HAVE TO TAKE CALLS FROM THE INDUSTRY THEY HAD TO WORK ON OTHER THINGS. SO WE'VE REALLY BE UP. LIMITED AT RISK THE ALL THE SUPERVISORS HAVE TO APPROVE ANY WORK OF THAT KIND AND SO. DOES PLEASE TALK IS A THE NON PAY OR- TO IT. AND THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING TO MAKE THE ENDLESS ARE. THAT BEFORE. THE FALL SOME. NASTY AND WE HAVE A- LOT ABOUT WHAT. KIND OF. IS AND WE ONLY DON'T THE MANAGER. NOW TO SPENT ALL THEIR TIME DOING. THINGS BUT THE NEED TO BE OVERSEEN MAKING SURE WERE. YOU KNOW. ALTHOUGH NEW. AND GETTING THE WORK OUT. SOME TARGET TO THE HOSPITAL SO COULD COULD YOU CAN YOU. JUST DESCRIBED TO ME IN SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY WHAT THIS NEW WAR LOOKS LIKE THIRTY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE SORRY THE THIRTY POSITIONS OR THE LICENSING SUPPORT STAFF I THINK BOTH HERE- YEAH SURE OKAY SO WILL I THINK WITH THE WITH THE REGULAR TALKING BEHIND THE REGULATORY BCP. IT IS A NEW WORKLOAD BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- THIS CERTAIN LEVEL OF BASELINE OF WHAT. OUR FOLKS DO. FOR FIELD REPS AGENTS AND AUDITOR'S WE WANT TO INCREASE THE TIME THAT THEY ARE IN THE CARD ROOMS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FINANCIALLY EVALUATION SO THAT IT'S DON'T. IT'S WORKING ON AN ONGOING BASIS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND NOT JUST RIGHT BEFORE WE GET UP TO THE TO YOUR RENEWAL CYCLE SO THAT IS- AN ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. OTHER THINGS LIKE WITH THE GAMES REVIEW UNIT IT'S NEW WORK BECAUSE ARE NOT CURRENTLY DOING IT NOW WE DON'T SEND THEM OUT TO THE FIELD WE DON'T HAVE THEM REVIEW. SURVEILLANCE WE DON'T HAVE WORK SO MUCH WITH THE AGENTS UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY NEED COME TO THEM FOR SOME HELP WE REALIZE THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REGULAR INEFFECTIVE IT'S THAT WE TO FOR THOSE GAME RULES ARE. BEING FONGBE IN THE CALM THE ESTABLISHMENTS MORE OFTEN OVER THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD PERSIST AT THE END OF THAT TWO YEAR PERIOD. IT SEEMS LIKE TO BE TO BE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE ESTABLISHMENT JUST INSTEAD OF. DOING ALL THE AND YOU JUST SPREADING IT OUT OVER TWO YEARS WHY WOULD THAT BE ADDITIONAL WORK WELL THEY WOULD GO INTO THE DO AN INSPECTION LET'S SAY ONE SECTION LET'S SEE DURING THAT TO YEAR CYCLE RIGHT NOW THEY WOULD BE GOING IN. EVERY MONTH. SO THAT IS AN INCREASE IN THE WORK LOAD. BOB IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT- WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THEY HAVE TO GO IN EVERY SINGLE MONTH. I THINK IS BEING PRESENT IN THE CARD GAMES AND MAKING SURE I MEAN IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO. ENSURE THAT THINGS ARE. WATER SOURCE ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP TO YOU WE HAVE. WE HAVE FOUND ISSUES YES. IT IS SO. AND SO WHY. WOULD YOU DO THAT ACROSS THE BOARD VERSES WITH CERTAIN ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH YOU MAY HAVE ISSUES. YEAH AND I SHOULD HAVE GOT THAT WITH THAT IF WE DO SEE- PROBLEMS IN AN REFER THE LICENSEE OR IF WE NEED TO DO SOME MORE ENFORCEMENT WORK THAT- IT IS MORE THAN. LIKE WILL GO WHEN THEY'RE DURING TO YOUR REAL PSYCHO. FOR WE WILL GO BACK. NOT JUST DON'T ONCE YOU IN. SO WE DO. TARGET BUT WE IF WE SEE AN ISSUE WE WILL GO BACK MORE TO THAT WAY PLACE BUT WE WILL LIKE TO IN ALL THE MORE BUT I DON'T THINK THEY WERE GOING TO GO THERE ONE IF WE DO THE WILL GO BACK WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH LICENSEE TO GET IN COMPLIANCE YOU KNOW WE ISSUE SOMETIMES AND YOU UP TO MAKE SURE THEIR INCOME. SO WE WHICH MAKES CA SO BUT ARE USING THAT YES STOP NEEDS THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF ATTENTION THE I THINK WE'RE TO BE TRYING TO BE EQUAL ABOUT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT AGAIN TREATING EVERYONE FAIRLY MAKING SURE WERE IN THERE AND LIKE YOU SAID SOME STUFF AND JUST A REALLY SMALL SO THE INSPECTION WILL BE A LOT MORE UP. YOU KNOW BRIEF I THINK WHERE IT IF THERE'S IN THE VERY LARGE CARDIUM THERE MAY BE THINGS MORE THINGS TO LOOK AT THAT WILL SPEND MORE TIME AND THEY'RE JUST BECAUSE THEY NEED TO COVER MORE SPACE TO LOOK AT. THINGS I WOULDN'T. UNDERSTAND WHAT'S PROBLEM WHICH- TO SOLVE I STILL ON. THAT I MEAN WE- WHEN YOU COME THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE WILL ALWAYS TRYING. AYE SOLUTION TO. WITH PROBLEM THAT. YOU MIGHT. THE KNEES. NEEDS THIS. STAFF RIGHT. I THINK TO. THAT WERE. THE DELAYS THAT WE HAD SEEN. OMIT SOMETHING THEY WERE FOR. WITH THAT WHEN THAT RUNS. I COME OUT THE- FINAL. COMES UP. THAT IF WITH. ISSUE IT'S ALWAYS THIS GRANT. TRYING TO REDO THE A- AND AN IT HOLDS THINGS UP. SO THAT IS A DELAY. REALLY AT THE ON. RECOMMEND KIND OF BRANCH OUT FOR. THAT THAT IS SOMETHING ONE WE WANT TO ELIMINATE THAT DELAY. AND THEN I THINK SO. IT IS JUST TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN DO OUR JOBS MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY WE DO HAVE. WE DO HAVE- WE HAVE THERE ARE ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE FOUND. AND WE WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON TOP OF IT. BUT IT SEEMS IF YOU WANT TO BE MORE EFFICIENT YOU THIRD HER. QUESTION BEFORE MORE. AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE TO THE FOUR TO THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH IS IT DOES SEEM ODD BECAUSE IT SEEMS. TO THE AUDITOR FOUND WHICH WAS. THAT THERE WAS SOURCE. SYSTEM ISSUES A LACK OF PEOPLE. YEAH AND THE IT PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE A- FOR THE LICENSE SUPPORT. WAS AS A RESULT OF WHAT AT THE I. FOR ON AND IDENTIFY THOSE EFFICIENT. INEFFICIENCIES AND OF THAT HAS TO DO WHO'S DOING THE WORK MAKE SURE THE WORK GETS DONE. IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T BACK UP. YEAH BUT LIKE I SAID IT HI IT'S ODD DO WITHIN A FEW. BY FOR MORE OF THE- IN IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WITH A DE TYPES OF FOLKS THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO. WITH THAT. ARE YOU YOU REDUCE THOSE OTHER OF FOLKS PRODUCTIVE. WHAT WE WILL LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF AN- THAT WE NEED. NEXT YOUR BRING FOR THAT BE BUT THESE. DESERVES ON AT ANALYST BE. REDEDICATED TO US MOTHER. TASK WELL THOSE ARE ANALYSTS THE ARE AT A AND A LITTLE COLD LET. RIGHTS WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE AT THE O. TWO THE OFFICE SAID. LEVEL THE PRO TAKE LEVEL. THE ARE YOU KNOW. STEPS BELOW THOSE TO SEE THAT WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE WHO MAY DON'T HAVE ANALYTICAL SKILLS WHO CAN DO THE WORK THAT IS JUST REVIEWING AN AND A- LIKE. AND THINGS THAT. THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN AN- LEVEL. YOU KNOW. WE WANT THEM TO CALM. ON BACK IN THIS. SO THAT IF INTO YOUR TOO MANY. MAYBE YOU NEED MORE TECHNICIANS OF HEARING. I DON'T WANNA SAY WE NEED YOUR LIFE THAT WHAT ONE EVER ARE OUR GUESTS I NEVER GET THE AND THE SKIN WE WILL WE DIDN'T REALIZE WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR OUR NEXT YEAR PERMANENT FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO OR NOW OF THOSE THIRTY TWO. SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT AFTER IMPLEMENTING THOSE PER SAY YES PETER JUMP. YEAH LET'S JUMP IN. MY NAME'S EDWARD BUT DRAW I'M THE CHIEF FOR THE DIVISION OF LAW AND I. WANTED TO SOMETHING OVER WANT TO COME. AS WE WHAT IS IT WHAT WE TRY. IT'S ACTIVITIES AT OCCURRING WITHIN CARD CLUBS AND THAT INCLUDES ALL VARIOUS FORMS OF. MONEY LAUNDERING OPERATIONS WHERE- HIGHLY ENGAGED NOW WITHIN SAN IN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. IN ENGAGING- WITH MORE PROACTIVE ENFORCEMENT- INVOLVING. A MONEY LAUNDERING ARE AT A CASINOS IN CALIFORNIA'S PRIME BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PART OF THAT WE HAVE. IN CALIFORNIA SO WE SPECIFICALLY ONE STOP FOR THAT AND BEING IN CASINOS MORE OFTEN LOOKING AT THAT. THAT COULD BE LOOKING AT. A LOOKING. THIS MISSION ACTIVITY REPORTS INSURING THAT THEIR- EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO PREVENT. FACT ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING. A PROVISION A PLACE IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE OTHER PARTIES ADEQUATE FINANCING WE HAD TO CLOSE. A DEAL I COULD SEE NO. NOT THAT LONG AGO BECAUSE- MINUS WHICH GOT OF THAT SO WE KNOW WE THIS PROBLEM ARE CAR. MOVING FOR NOT REACTING TO THEM EMERGENCY CLOSURE SHOULD BE LAST AND WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR IN THERE- ACTING- APPROPRIATELY NOT PROPERLY BACKING INTO PRO ACTIVELY- IN IN ENSURING THAT ALL THESE CASINOS ARE HAVING ENOUGH PROPER FINANCING ENSURE THAT WOULD SOMEWHAT TO CASH IN THEIR CHIPS. THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO CASH IN THEIR CHIPS SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES. SINCE YOU'VE USED THE TERMINOLOGY CARDROOM IN CASINOS INTERCHANGEABLY. SO YOU'RE SAYING SO IT TOOK THIS IS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED- AT CHI CARBONS NOT AT CASINOS NOPE WE'VE IDENTIFIED APPLE FOR. BOTH THE- AND YOUR AND YOUR- I'M LOOKING AT BOTH. YES HEY ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS IS SOMETHING SORT OF. A CROSS THE BORDER THAT IS OCCURRING OR JUST AT- SPECIFIC ESTABLISHMENTS SO CRISTINA IS BECAUSE OF THE CASH OPERATIONS IS A PRIME LOCATION FOR THESE SELECT. WHETHER IT BE A CARTER MORE CASINO THERE IT'S BOTH WHETHER YOU WANT TO STRUCTURE YOU WANTED. HOWEVER YOU LIKE TO. WANDER THE MONEY THERE'S NOT. TO DO THAT SO WE BOTH. DOES THE CARD WELL THIS IS OUR CONCERN TO ME THIS SOME OF THE WORST THAT HEARD THAT YOU WERE SAYING ACROSS THE BOARD AT OUR GAMBLING IS TO UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT YOU VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MONEY LAUNDERING HAPPENING AT PRETTY MUCH ALL WELL I THINK YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY ALL OF THEM BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE CERTAINLY 90% OF THEM FIFTY OF THEM WE TALK ABOUT OUR- BUT HARD TO PUT INTO JOHN I'M BUT SICK WILL. I'M IN THE TALKING PERCENT. NINE FORTY. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE MEDIA. A TELL YOU THE ONE. PRETTY EGREGIOUS FOR EXAMPLE IT ATTORNEY GENERAL MENTIONED- HAWAIIAN GARDENS WITHOUT SOME OTHER ACTIVE CASES GOING ON WE- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY OUT THERE SOME. WOMEN I I'M NOT. JUST DISAGREEING RIGHT BED. AGAIN I THINK YOU'RE MAKING SUPPOSITIONS SO. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MENTIONED ONE. CAR TRUMP BUT IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE TO ONE CARD ROOM AND I DON'T KNOW I FORGET HOW MANY CARD AND YOU WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ME. THE CARD CZAR BUT I MEAN IT'S A TO TECH IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SORT OF ONE INDIVIDUAL AND- A WHOLE CLASS OF. TWO THIRDS MORE THAN ONCE REALLY LATE ALSO OR IS ONE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW- WE MENTIONED- CASES GET APOSTLE ROLES IS ONE MARYSVILLE. I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW. IF YOU WANNA PERCENTAGES BE HARD FOR ME TO GUESS I WOULD- GIVING US MISSION IS NOT THE ENTIRE. CARD CLUB INTERVIEW BY. BY CHANCE BUT I WOULD SAY FIFTEEN TWENTY PERCENT. BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGES I MEAN WHAT WHETHER IT. BE GREEN JUSTICE OF THE 1% IS VERY IMPORTANT. MORE NO ABSOLUTELY DOES BECAUSE- AGAIN. IF THIS IS AS- IS MASS PROBLEM YOU HANDLE IT BY. CHANGING YOUR ENTIRE SYSTEM TO ADDRESS. ALL THE ESTABLISHMENTS EQUALLY. IF THIS IS. SOMETHING HAPPENING WITH ONLY YOU KNOW. TEN OR LET'S SAY ASSUME THAT YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE TARGET BECAUSE WHY WHY WOULD YOU. WASTE RESOURCES ON THE PORTAL QUOTE OTHER 80% IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY SUSPICION THAT THERE IS. A LEGAL ACTIVITY GOING BUT THAT WOULD ASSUME THAT THAT THE TARGET SEE STATIC SO I MEAN AS AS YOU ADDRESS MONEY LAUNDERING ONE LOCATION- AND EITHER COME COMPLIANCE WE TAKE SOME KIND OF ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THEM. WHAT WOULD BE THE NATURAL RESPONSE BY A SOMEONE WANTS TO HONOR MONIES TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER LOCATION. SO IF IT'S A YEAH I PROBABLY SHUTS OUT ATTIC YEAH RIGHT BUT IF YOU SHUT DOWN ONE LOCATION THAT'S ANOTHER QUICK KISS PARTS OF. THE NUMBER STILL STAYS THE SAME. OR STILL CHASING THE PROBLEM THAT WE NEED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT AGREE DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT- WHAT WHAT I HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR WAS A- ACROSS THE BOARD BROAD BRUSH APPROACH. TO THE ISSUE. NOT A- TARGETED APPROACH WHICH SEEMS MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT. YOUR FUND AGAIN. COM THAT. I'M NOT SURPRISED NOW THAT THE AUDITOR MY FOUND INEFFICIENCIES BECAUSE AGAIN. IF YOU'RE SPENDING IF YOU TREAT. WRAPPING UP PLANS TO RAMP UP ENFORCEMENT OR LICENSING ACROSS THE BOARD. AND YOU HAVE. THE SAME NO LOGISTICS. PERCENT NOT EVEN THE EARLIER. 70% OF. US MISSED REALLY HAVEN'T EXHIBITED A KEY PROBLEM MORE. SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY BUT YOU'RE SPENDING ALL THESE RESOURCES TO. AGAIN ASKED THEM TO SORT OF X. Y. Z. THAT THE LEASE QUESTION AS- TO WHAT NO WONDER THERE'S AN EFFICIENCY GOING ON. AT YOU. WITH THE TWENTY CHANNELS WHAT WERE WE DON'T WANT TO BE THERE THERE'S A WE WILL TO ENSURE THAT PROBABLY DOES OCCUR AND SO HOW WE KNOW IF THAT PROBLEM SHIFTING WE'RE TAKING FORSMAN. OR WE'RE LOOKING AT ANOTHER CASINO SO WE HAVE TO ACROSS THE BOARD BE INSPECTING THESE LOCATIONS SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LEVEL OF THE PROBLEM IS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT PROBABLY IS MIGRATING TO THE CASINO THAT'S I THINK WHAT US TRANSIT. PERCENT I GUESS THE QUESTION. THE LEVEL OF THIS. RIGHT I'M AND AGAIN- IT. THE IS THE LEVEL OF INSPECTION TODAY. HOW OR INADEQUATE AND THAT AND THAT THAT THAT I THINK THAT'S SORT OF THE QUESTION THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SAYS THAT IT'S INADEQUATE AND HAS HIGHLIGHTED SORT OF ACROSS THE BOARD SYSTEMATIC CREASED AS ON THE LEVEL OF WORK BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH YOUR YOUR- PARTICULAR- DEPARTMENT THAT WE HAD IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. IS EVERY- THEY GET NOT I WITH THE TRUCK PARTS PROJECT THE EVERYBODY COMES TO THIS RIGHT IN EVERY EVERYBODY SOLUTION TO EVERY PROBLEM WE SEE IS JUST GETTING GETTING MORE BCP'S GETTING MORE PEOPLE. BRING IT OUT AND WE HAVE AN ALL THAT SAID ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE NOT ON ALL THE OTHER ISSUES ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT REALLY MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT SOLUTION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE HAVE I THINK SOME FOLKS WHO WANT TO MAKE STATEMENT YOU EACH HAVE ONE MINUTE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY BEHIND IN OUR SCHEDULE TODAY. WE HAVE A- THREE MORE ITEMS TO GO THROUGH AND WE'VE ONLY DONE THREE SO WE'RE HALFWAY THERE IN TERMS OF THE ITEM SO YOU EACH HAVE ONE MINUTE- TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE SOME OF YOU HAVE STATE MATERIAL WITH ME EARLY SO I'M I'M AWARE OF THE CONSTRAINTS SO WILL BEGIN I THOUGHT. THE FIRST PERSON YES- MADAM CHAIR DR WEBBER- MEMBERS OF THE- SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN LEVEL IT. ENDING A PLAYER CLUB INTERNET THEIR BASE IN VAN BUT- BEFORE I. IN IN ANOTHER LIFE I WAS- ASSISTANT CHIEF DEPUTY LA CITY CONTROLLER AND USED TO DO AUDITS- WHAT I WOULD STRONGLY COMMAND TO THIS COMMITTEE. IS THAT BEFORE YOU TAKE ANY ACTION. APPROPRIATING A NICKEL CUT IN HALF FOR THESE ACTIVITIES YOU GO BACK AND YOU REALLY LOOK AT THE AUDIT AND YOU LOOK AT THE- TAPE OF THE HEARING I MEAN I THINK IT'S AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS NOT IN THE WHEEL HOUSE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE- AGENCY THAT IS MORE EQUIPPED TO DO LICENSING IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. AND THEY DO IT THEY DON'T MISS DEADLINES- AND I WOULD- SUGGESTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ALTERNATIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU. VENTURE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS ED MANNING WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND I- REPRESENT HAWAIIAN GARDENS FEMALE. SO I WANT TO TALK ON TWO LEVELS ONE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE- SEVERAL REFERENCES TO LÏNG GARDENS. BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE BAFFLING ON TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD. THE AUDIT ADDRESSED LICENSING ISSUES AND- THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THAT WHICH ARE WELL ESTABLISHED SOMEHOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MANAGED TO BOOTSTRAP ONTO AN AUDIT THE RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LICENSING PROCESS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THIRTY NEW. E. WISE FOR ENFORCEMENT. LICENSING IS NOT THE SAME AS ENFORCEMENT ALTHOUGH THEY TRIED TO CONFLATE TO ARM THE AUDIT AS IS POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE LA OWN STAFF THE AUDIT MAKES NO MENTION OF AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE YET YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND OVER FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST FOR THIRTY NEW PERMANENT HE- FOR ENFORCEMENT WHICH- IS. NOT JUSTIFIED AND JUST TO POINT OUT ONE OF MANY FACTORS ONE YOU'VE GOT LESS THAN HALF THE NUMBER CAR CLUB JUDGE TWENTY YEARS AGO CURRENTLY SO IF ANYTHING BEEN MOUNTAIN THE PORTS AND SHOULD BE DOWN SECOND YOU HAVE A REGULATION THAT WILL ELIMINATE IN CARD CLUBS WHICH RAISES OTHER CONCERNS BUT CERTAINLY THERE WOULD BE A NEED FOR US AND FORCE MEANT NOT MORE. UP IF YOU THE WHOLE THING GUARD AND A JUST THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED JUST FOR THE COMMITTEES PERSPECTIVE- VERY QUICKLY YES- THAT WAS A AND SENATE MINISTRATION FIND. THIS TO CLEAR IT'S IN A MINUTE PENALTY BY IN THE STRAIT OF AGENCY AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION IT'S A RECORD KEEPING VIOLATION. NOT MONEY LAUNDERING NOT A CRIMINAL VIOLATION NOT EVEN A CIVIL VIOLATION AND I HAVE THAT COMPLAINT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT I'M CHAIR TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA GRAND CASINO. MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE HALF AS MANY CARD CLUBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. THERE WE HAD TWO DECADES AGO. AND IF THESE ONEROUS NEW REGULATIONS COME THROUGH WE MAY HAVE HALF. IN A YEAR FROM NOW THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY SO THE IDEA BAGS THAT WE NEED. LESS REGULATION AND ARE A LESSON FOR SPENT IN CERTAINLY WAS BEING CALLED FOR- BY THE- THE BUDGET REQUEST TODAY. OF USE MY THIRTY SECONDS TO SAY THIS. IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS. IT IS RARE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN SOMEONE COME TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO ASK FOR THIS MUCH. REINFORCEMENT THESE KINDS OF P. WISE WITHOUT FIRST EXPLAINING WHAT THEY ARE ALREADY DOING WITH WHAT THEY HAVE. AND SECOND OF ALL CLEARLY DELINEATING WHAT THEY WOULD DO WITH WHAT THEY WERE GIVEN. A PREMATURE AND IT'S UNNECESSARY THANK YOU.

I JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY STRONGLY OPPOSES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL BUDGET REQUEST FOR THIRTY NEW POSITIONS THIS REQUEST IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE BROKE DOWN THE CONTROL CURRENTLY HAS THIRTY FOUR VACANT POSITIONS. THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL ONLY AS I'M SORRY HIS OWN FILLED A HUNDRED NINETY TWO OF THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FUNDED POSITIONS THE BILL HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN WHEN OR HOW THEY WILL FEEL THE THIRTY FOUR VACANT POSITIONS. LET ALONE THIRTY ADDITION MISSIONS WHICH IS ASK FOR WHICH WILL ONLY INCREASE THE BUDGETS VACANCY SIXTY FOUR POSITIONS WITH THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS INCREASE PRESSURE. NOT LEGISLATOR HAS PREVIOUS APPROVED EMBRACE. THIRD TO A POSITION. WHICH MORE THAN TWO THE BEER SLICES STAFF STAFF. DESPITE THE INCREASE STAFFING THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REVEALED THAT THE PRODUCTIVITY ACTUALLY DIMINISHED- WITH THE HIRING OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND THE BACKLOG INCREASED. ARE THESE POSITIONS EVEN NECESSARY. NO I LIKE TO ALSO REFERENCE THE FACT THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS ONE EMPLOYEE PERK. NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT LICENSEES. ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL BOARD HAS ONE KHLOE PER A HUNDRED NINETY SIX LICENSEES SO AGAIN OUR POSITIONS PLEASED TO KNOCK IT DEFINING THIS. VERY MUCH MA'AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF A NEW WAVE SHORT ON TIME SO HOPEFULLY THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO LAWS THAT. WE DON'T NEED THE POSITIONS WE'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE SHORTER OKAY BUT THE OTHER IDEA. ABOUT MAKE JEWEL IT YOU ALLOW. TEND TO MY H. THAT MY THE PATTERN ON. BEHALF AGAIN ASIAN. THANK YOU. REPORTED A DISH FUNNY FROM THE PAST AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT WERE TO THIS ADDITIONAL WITHIN WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK IN A- NOW THAT THE BACK SCHOOL AND ALSO THE AUDITOR'S HAVE IN A WRECK OF AND- ALLOW THEM TO DO THE WORK AND SEE HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK OUT FOR A GIVE THEM MORE POSITIONS ALSO TO DATE SINCE THE REALLY HOT IT WE HAVEN'T HAD OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE B.

I'M CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEGAN LOPER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA COMMERCE CLUB APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND THAT. AN ANALYSIS DONE B THE STAFF THE AUDITOR ENDS AT THE LA- AND THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DEBATE THAT YOU ALWAYS COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO PERMANENT FUNDING VERSUS TEMPORARY. FUNDING AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION HERE WE ARE VERY CONCERNED. I WITH THIS CURRENT REQUEST THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DANIELLE GARDEN HERE REPRESENTING CASINO MERCED. I WAS TELLING A FRIEND THIS WEEKEND ABOUT THE BUDGET REQUEST SEEKING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SWORN PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS TO FIFTY EIGHT. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATIONS THE COVERS THREE POINT SIX MILLION PROFESSIONALS HAS SIXTY SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. THE BUREAU HAS ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND LICENSEES YOU CAN IMAGINE MY FRIENDS CONFUSION AND OUTRAGE. THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS THE BUREAU'S BUDGET REQUEST IS OUT OF PROPORTION OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND TO OTHER STATES. GAMBLING CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT IN NEED OF MORE FUNDING TO AN INEFFICIENT BUREAU IT NEEDS RESTRUCTURING. A SYSTEM WHERE COSTS ARE PROPERLY ALIGNED BETWEEN LICENSING AND REGULATORY FEES AND REDUCE BY GREATER EFFICIENCY IS NEEDED. WE ASK THE BUDGET REQUEST BE DENIED AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER CONSOLIDATING THE CURRENT PRICE FOR KIDS STRUCTURE INTO AN EFFICIENT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THAT SERVES LICENSEES AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN A JUROR PLANNING ON BEHALF OF LUCKY CHANCES CASINO- ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES AND STRONGLY URGE YOU GUYS TO CONSIDER- OF RECONSTRUCTING THIS THIS AGENCY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY I THINK WE'VE HEARD OF. BOTH ALL SIDES AND WILL OBVIOUSLY TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION WHEN WE GET READY TO TALK ABOUT BUDGETING AND MEETING THOSE NEEDS IN THE REPORT TO COME THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE OF YOU CAME. THAT THEN BRINGS US TO OUR FOURTH ITEM WHICH IS THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES. FUND AND EQUIPMENT REFRESH. OKAY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA. MANAGER CHRIS RYAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SO KEEP IT BRIEF- WE ARE ASKING FOR A- PROPOSAL TO ASSIST WITH THE BACK FILL IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST YEAR- IT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR. FOR ONE TIME ON A ONE TIME BASIS- SO THE BACK FILL AMOUNT IS THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS- GENERAL FUND. AND THERE'S ALSO A SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR EQUIPMENT. REFRESH THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL- I THINK LA- HAS MAY HAVE SOME OTHER. ITEMS TO DISCUSS BUT THAT'S OUR THAT PROPOSAL. OKAY IN. BUT FOR FINANCE ANY COMMENTS HELLO HEAVILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE ARE RECOMMENDING APPROVAL- THERE IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN JUSTIFICATION HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT IT IS NOT A PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORTING- THE BUREAU AND SPECIFICALLY THIS ISSUE OF THE DECLINE AN ON GOING CRIMINAL FINE IF YOU REVENUE DEPOSIT INTO DENIED IDENTIFICATION FUND TO SUPPORT THEM. HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO BACK FILL SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH US SO TO ADDRESS THIS ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS WE ARE RECOMMENDING TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO SUPPORTING- THE BUREAU SPECIFICALLY WE ARE RECOMMENDING REQUIRING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY HAVING THEM PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE SERVICES. THAT THEY RECEIVE AND SO CURRENTLY- THESE LOCAL AGENCIES ABOUT FORTY SIX COUNTIES ARE NOT BEING CHARGED FOR SERVICES AND THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT THAT THEY RECEIVE- AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT IN CHARGE FOR THEIR SERVICES THERE REALLY IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO THINK ABOUT- HOW WHAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE TO CLAPTON KIND PRIORITIZING WHAT THE COMMITTED TO JAY BEYOND. ITS CAPACITY AS WE DO CAN I TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE MANY ONE YEAR DELAY IN ADDITION TO THAT ARE RECOMMENDING- THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT TO BE OJ TO REPORT PLAN FOR ALL CHELATING. THE ARE. I'M THE LOCAL WOULD REPRESENT WERE WRECKED WOULD UP OF ABOUT 50% OF THE BUREAU'S OPERATING BUDGETS- AND THIS WOULD EFFECTIVELY REPLACE THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DOJ AND WORKING THROUGH THE PLAN COULD TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS AND STRUCTURED IN VARIOUS WAYS TO- RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT DIFFERENCES BASED ON THE TYPE OF FRIENDS EX SERVICE THAT'S OFFERED ON THE SIZE OF THE AGENCY AND ALSO SPEED OF SERVICE AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND XIN OF THAT REPORT IN TIME FOR CONSIDER. AS PART OF MY PEERS BUT AND IF THE STRUCTURE PER LEE IT WOULD PROVIDE A PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTION TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS I'M JUST ONE LAST PIECE- THERE IS A SEPARATE REQUEST FOR NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR THIS CONSOLIDATED FORENSIC LABORATORY THAT WAS REFERENCED PREVIOUSLY THIS NEW APPROACH COULD CHANGE DOJ'S WORKLOAD IN OPERATIONS AND SO TO THE EXTENT IT DOES WE JUST RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT DOJ TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY FUTURE FUNDING FOR REFLECT THOSE CHANGES. WE HAVE. COME ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS. OKAY ONLY ONLY QUESTION I HAD WAS AND THIS IS- AND MAYBE YOU CAN REASSURED ME THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE THAT IF WE START CHARGING SOME OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR SERVICES THAT THEY MAY WANT FEWER SERVICES IN A TIME WHERE WE PROBABLY NEED GREATER SERVICE IS GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN- SOMEHOW ANOTHER EXONERATED BECAUSE OF DNA EVIDENCE AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY'LL BE FAIRNESS AND EQUITY FOR ALL PERSONS IF WE YOU KNOW IN SOME JURISDICTIONS CHOOSE NOT TO USE YOU AS MUCH BECAUSE IT ON THE RESOURCES A MAN CHAIR BERRY MILLER FROM THE GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THAT QUESTION- WE THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE DON'T- THAT'S OUR CONCERN AS WELL IS THAT. IF WE DO START TO- PUT A FINE ON LOCAL AGENCIES FOR FORENSIC SERVICES THERE WILL BE HARD CHOICES THAT HAVE TO BE MADE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY CAN AFFORD TO SUBMIT A PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT LEAD TO. A ANALYSIS THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES CLOSER TO A CASE WE'RE ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH THE FACT THAT- THERE WOULDN'T BE EQUAL ACCESS TO THAT JUSTICE WITH THE VICTIMS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ACTUALLY DO WANT THEIR EVIDENCE ANALYZED. AND WE DID PROVIDE A REPORT TALKING A LOT ABOUT THAT- IN AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE WERE IN THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO- MANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS. YES MADAM CHAIR EDWARD MACHADO. SO PRIOR TO THIS POSITION I WAS PLEASE SHE FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND CITY MANAGER FOR TWO AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE START LOOKING AT MAKING DECISIONS- OF WHAT TO SEND IN BASED ON WHAT AN ITEM WAS GONNA COST TO BE PROCESSED BY A FORENSIC LAB WILL DEFINITELY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY NOT ONLY PLEASE CHOOSE BUT CITY MANAGERS WHO HAVE TO DO SO LOCAL CITY BUDGETS. AND IT WAS AS THE LA- SAID YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON PRIORITIZING WHAT EVIDENCE TO SEND TEN- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT EVIDENCE WILL PRODUCE IN TERMS OF SENDING SOMETHING AND THAT IS OF HIGH VALUE OUR LOW VALUE CONNECTS THE DOTS TWO OF THE CRIMES THAT WE DON'T KNOW- THAT COMMITTED HOW CAN IT HELP US. MAKE A CASE FOR EXAMPLE OTHER INDIVIDUALS IT'S HARD TO TELL- THE MORE INFORMATION THE MORE SAMPLES WE HAVE THE MORE EVIDENCE THAT'S TURNED ON I THINK. MORE PEOPLE ARE SERVED- IT IN TERMS OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THEN IF FOR MAKING DECISIONS ON HOW MUCH IT COST TO SEND SOMETHING IN. ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I THAT THAT'S MY MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE WITH THE PROPOSAL- MAYBE I'VE BEEN- INUNDATED WITH READING THE BOOK JUST MURPHY JUST MERCY. AND KNEW MOST OF THE STUFF BUT I WAS AS ONE ONCE AGAIN. AS THE GOVERNOR SAID IT'S BETTER TO BE GUILTY AND RATES THAN TO BE POOR AND THE SECOND CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN OF MINE THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO. I SERVICES PROVIDED FOR EVERYONE AND SOMETIMES PUTTING FEEL ME SERVICES- THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION NOT TO GO THAT WAY IN A MAYES TOLERATE THE PERSON OR THEY'LL MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PUTTING THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO CONVICT SOMEBODY BUT NOT EXONERATE PEOPLE SO. IT'S AN ONGOING A BATTLE I GUESS WITH THE QUESTION OF BECAUSE EVERYONE DESERVES THE SAME LEVEL OF JUSTICE. AND THAN OTHERS YOU KNOW AND I THINK EVERYONE DESERVES A LAB THAT'S REALLY FUNCTIONAL AND REALLY SUPPORT IT. AND THAT'LL BIG SEATS CAN DO THAT A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN WELL CITIES AND- SOLD IT BUT THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WILL TO HEAR FROM. OVER THE LAST THREE GROUP THAT WOULD DO HERE. OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND ONCE FOR THOSE TWO GROUPS WOULD NOT AT THE FIFTH ITEM WHICH IS UPDATE- I'M SORRY TO. CATCH ME EITHER. TO ANY WHO TURNED YOU OWN. LARA. I THINK THESE THINGS OF US AROUND A- YOU KNOW RECALL ALL I THOUGHT MIKE. OH MY GOODNESS MAKES PARANOID UPDATE ON INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE- USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROGRAM.

TIFFANY JOHNSON AND STEVE THERE HAVE. TOM THOMAS YEAH WHAT IS A JOHNSON. MY BRAIN IS GONE FIFTY DOLLARS A OKAY. SO GOOD MORNING FIRSTLY MADAM CHAIR AND ARE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ALMOST LEAVING YEAH. I'M TOMATOES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA- CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I'M ALSO SITTING BOARD MEMBER AT THE CHAPTER PRESIDENT OF SAN CLIMB. AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU OFFER LET MUST BE HERE THIS IS MY FIRST TIME DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'RE GIVING US. I'VE BEEN A DEPARTMENT FOR APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN YEARS AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER. DURING THAT TIME COMING AND IT BASICALLY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY I'VE BEEN A PART OF THE BEGINNING STAGE OF THE CHANGE WHERE WE WENT FROM THE OLD WAY OF DOING THINGS. TWO ONE ALL THE NEW PROGRAMS CAME ON AND I THAT I CAN SEE A LOT OF POSITIVES AND HOW IT HELPS THE COMMUNITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME ISSUES. IN REGARDS TO HOW THAT AFFECTS US AS OFFICERS BECAUSE WE'VE KIND OF BECOME THE FORGOTTEN ONCE. I LEARNED EARLY IN MY CAREER THAT MY POWER OF OBSERVATION. WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL TOOLS IN MY TO ABOUT. HAVING THE TIME AN ABILITY TO LEARN THE INMATES HABITS AND ROUTINES. I BECAME A GREAT PREDICTOR OF EVENTS AND PRO ACTIVELY SAVE A LOT OF LIVES. STAFF AND INMATES ALIKE. HOWEVER THE DECREASING STAFFING LEVELS. IN THE FACE OF INCREASING PROGRAMS. NO LONGER AFFORD THIS THE TIME TO OBSERVE WE'RE ESPECIALLY TAXIS GETTING ONE IN MAY TWO POINT AB AND C. AND THEN RE ACTIVELY RIAGE IN ALONE IN AN INCIDENT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. RESULTING IN INCREASING VIOLENCE AND OFFICER EXPOSURE. TO TRAUMA AND CRITICAL INCIDENTS. LET ME REITERATE I WILL NOT GRIPE ABOUT THE PROGRAMS. I'M FROM THE BAY AREA AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE INMATES. WILL BE COMING OUT ON THE STREETS AND THEY WILL BE MY NEIGHBORS. THEY WILL BE THE PARENTS OF THE CHILDREN. IN OUR SCHOOLS. THEY WILL BE IN OUR GROCERY STORES IN OUR CHURCH WITH US. THE ISSUE IS THAT WITH THE AND- OF THE PROGRAMS. YOU'RE DECREASING STAFFING LEVELS. AND INFLICTING SOME WOUNDS THAT HAVE YET TO BE. IDENTIFIED OR ACKNOWLEDGED. FOR THE STAFF THAT ATTEST TO CARRY OUT THAT JOB. THE FIRST DECADE OF MY CAREER I SPENT SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK MANDATED TO WORKING SIXTEEN HOUR SHIFT DURING THE STREET EIGHT AND SIXTEEN HOUR SHIFTS SPENDING MORE TIME IN PRISON THAN AT HOME. I WAS TAX WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING CONDITIONS IN DEALING WITH THE POPULOUS THAT HAS BEEN CONDITIONED TO THINK THAT WE ARE THE ENEMY WHICH IS IN DIRECT OPPOSITION TO MAINTAINING THEIR SAFETY AND SECURITY AS WELL AS OURS. WE WITNESS EXTREME I WAS A VIOLENCE OVER THIRTY PLUS YEAR CAREER. THAT IS A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON A PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND MENTAL ILLNESS. WE'RE DEALING WITH A POPULATION OF TRAUMATIZED PEOPLE. THAT INFLICT INFLICT TRAUMA OR OTHER INMATES AND STAFF. AND THEN WE ARE EXPECTED TO GO HOME AND MANAGE THAT TRAUMA. WITH OURSELVES. AND TRYING NOT TO RE TRAUMATIZE THEIR FAMILIES. BY EXPLAINING WHAT WE SAW DURING THE DAY. MUCH LIKE INMATES WE GET INSTITUTIONALIZED. IT'S NOW REFER TO AS CORRECTION FATIGUE. WITHOUT GIVING IT A NAME BUT WE STILL LACK THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS IT. THE LACK OF TENDERNESS MEETING IN CONNECTION THE ENVELOPES THE PRISON CULTURE AFTER CONTINUE TO EXPOSURE DOES SOMETHING TO OUR MINDS BECAUSE I AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE SPEND MORE TIME IN PRISON. THAN WE DO AT HOME. IF YOU INCLUDE THE PREP TIME TO COME TO PRESENT. AND THE DEBRIEFING PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THERE ARE COMMUTE SO THAT WE DON'T COME HOME A BECOME APATHETIC ROBOT STORE FAMILIES. PERSONALLY THAT REALIZATION CAME TO FRUITION SEVERAL YERS AGO. AT A SOCIAL FUNCTION WITH MY FAMILY WHEN I EXPERIENCE THE ARTS THE STATION OF BEING A SPECTATOR IN MY OWN LIFE. AS IF I'M WATCHING THE WORLD HAPPEN AROUND ME VERSUS ENGAGING. AND PARTICIPATING I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AMONG THE RANKS IT TAKES THAT TO TAKE THE CHILL OFF. WITH RESPECT TO TIME OF SHARE A COUPLE OF EXPERIENCES IF YOU DON'T MIND. WHEN AN INMATE JUMPED TO THEIR DEATH FROM THE FOURTH HERE. EVEN THOUGH THEIR BRAIN APPEARS TO BE UNCONSCIOUS THEIR ARMS AND LEGS CONTINUED MOVED IN A FAILED ATTEMPT TO GET UP. WITH THEIR SHATTERED FACE AND TORSO STUCK TO THE GROUND. DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN THE OXYGEN IS DEPLETED FROM THE BRAIN ONE ONE HANGS THEMSELVES. THEIR BODIES FOUGHT VIOLENTLY LIKE A FISH. WHAT WERE TASKED. TO TRY TO CUT THEM DOWN SAFELY. I FORGOT TO MENTION THEIR FACES BLOW UP TWICE THE SIZE THAT'S AN IMAGE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA COME HOME AND TELL YOUR SPOUSE YOUR CHILDREN ABOUT THAT. FOR ONE YOU DON'T WANT TO TRAUMATIZE THEM BUT NUMBER TWO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU EVERY DAY WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK. THAT IS OUR NORMAL THAT WE EXISTING HENCE WHY REGULARLY GET CAUGHT PHONE CALLS FROM MY PARTNER STRUGGLING BETWEEN THE HOURS OF MIDNIGHT TO AM. THERE TOO AFRAID TO CONTACT THE PEER SUPPORT TEAM. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF CONFIDENTIALITY. AFRAID THAT ONE WRONG WORD WOULD RESULT IN A WEAPONS RESTRICTION THAT WILL TAKE THEIR JOB FROM THEM. IT WILL BE FURTHER UP THE CREEK WITHOUT A PADDLE. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WE GRACIOUSLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE. IN OUR ENDEAVORS TO CULTIVATE EXPAND WELL THIS TOOL FOR STAFF SUCH AS PEER SUPPORT ME P. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO IMPROVE THOSE CONDITIONS WITHIN THE WALLS AND THOSE PROGRAMS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH YOU. BECAUSE WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE AS FAR THAT CORRECTIONAL FATIGUE THAT'S COME ONLINE. IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ACTUALLY WORKS FOR A MEMBERS. THANK YOU YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS STEVEN TERMS I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AT THE CITY I CATCH ME FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER. OVER MY CAREER I'VE WITNESSED MANY EXTREME EVENTS OR VIOLENT ACTS IN SUICIDES NOT ONLY WITH MY PARTNERS BUT MY- BY. INMATES EARLY IN MY CAREER IS WORKING A UNIT AND WE WERE FEEDING THE EVENING MEAL. OUR PARTNER YELLS OUT THAT WE HAVE A HANGER. TWO OF US WENT INTO THE CELL AS I WRAP MY ARMS AROUND THE INMATE AND CARED LIFTED THEM UP. MY OTHER PARTNER JUMPED UP AND TOOK THE NEEDS ARE. THAT WAS NINETEEN YEARS AGO AND I STILL SEE THE ENEMY IN MY MIND. OKAY. START LIKE AFTER THE INCIDENT WE'RE OFFER PEER SUPPORT IN BEING A YOUNG THE NEW OFFER I BELIEVED I WAS SUPERMAN I REFUSE AND WHEN I GOT HOME THAT NIGHT I CLOSED MY EYES AND COULD SEE THE INMATE WHO HAD DIED. NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO WAS SIGNIFICANT EVENT OR INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR CAREERS. WE CAN RECALL ALMOST EVERY SENSE OR A LITTLE DETAILS. THAT'S CORRECT LAUNCHERS WE SEE THINGS THAT NO PERSON SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO. WE HAVE BEEN WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF STAFF SUICIDES THAT HAS BECOME AN EPIDEMIC. IN HIS LEAVING THOSE ALL SCRAMBLING TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS. I BELIEVE FIRST WE MUST LOOK AT WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE DEPARTMENT DURING THIS TURN. WE SAW AN INCREASE OF. IN SUICIDES DURING THE FURLOUGH TIMES AS MANY OF OUR PARTNERS WERE LOSING EVERYTHING THEY OWN AS WE LOST 15% OF OUR PAY. AFTER THAT WE SAW IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STAFFING STANDARDIZED STAFFING. THAT THE STATE HAS ATTEMPTED TO USE A STANDARD STANDARDIZE RULE WHEN EACH AND EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT BASED ON LAYOUT AND DESIGN OR PROGRAM. THIS REDUCTION IS LEAVING OUR PRISON STAFFING LEVELS SO LOW THAT IT IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE JOB DONE. MOST EMPLOYEES IN THE DEPARTMENT YOU DON'T WANT TO FAIL IN THEIR TAX BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE. THIS IS WHAT THE STAFF CUTTING CORNERS JUST TO GET THE INMATES TO THE PROGRAMS. WHICH OPENS OURSELVES UP FOR DISCIPLINE TO THE DEPARTMENT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS CHANGED. IN THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN THE RELEASE A LOWER LEVEL WITH OFFENDERS AND THIS IS LEFT US WITH THE MOST VIOLENT INMATES REGULATION STRANGERS DEBTORS TIED THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDS IN DEALING WITH A MADE TO FILL THE PROGRAM AND ARE IN A MORE VIOLENT TOWARDS STAFF AND OTHER INMATES. MOST OF OUR LEVEL FOUR YARDS IN THE STATE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE IT IS ROUTINE FOR OUR STAFF TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE BY THAT THE VENTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WOOD NOBILITY THAT THE COMPRESS OR EVEN WRITE A REPORT BEFORE THE NEXT VIOLENT EVENT. THE CYCLE CONTINUES SOMETIMES INTO THE MAKESHIFT OR THE NEXT DAY. THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE THAT STAFF FOR BEING SUBJECTED TO IT'S CAUSING AN INCREASE IN THE CASES OF PTSD. ADDING TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT. WHEN AN OFFICER NEEDS TO TAKE A DAY OFF. FOR THEIR OWN MENTAL WELL BEING ANY OVERTIME THAT THEY HEARD GETS CONVERTED TO NORMAL PAY. THIS GREAT FEAR THAT THEIR PAY WILL BE REDUCED AND MEANS OFFERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO TAKE THE TIME OFF THAT THEY NEED TO RECOVER. THE DEPARTMENT HAS A PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM. AN EDP HOWEVER MOST EMPLOYEES WILL NOT UTILIZE IT. OUT OF FEAR WORST FEARS DERIVED FROM HELP QUICKLY DEPARTMENT TRIES TO DISCIPLINE STAFF FOR THE SMALLEST INFRACTION AND THAT MOST EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT THESE PROGRAMS WILL PUT THEIR CAREER RISK. SO STAFF WILL PUSH THROUGH. AND DEAL WITH. AND PTSD CONTINUES TO CREEP UP. THIS COULD BE IN THE FORM OF SELF MEDICATION ALCOHOL OR OTHER FORMS RATHER THAN TRULY DEALING WITH THE ISSUES ULTIMATELY EVERY PERSON HAS A BREAKING POINT AND IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE. FOR SOME THAT IS IN THE FORM OF SUICIDE FOR OTHERS THEY RESOLVE. BOTH OF WHICH HARM THE DEPARTMENTS OVER ON YOUR HOUSE. ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. STILL FIFTH. THANK YOU BOTH FOR SHARING THAT INFORMATION I MEAN WE ARE TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT THE- NOT ONLY THE INMATES WITH THOSE WHO WORK IN OUR IN OUR FACILITIES AS WELL AND THEIR WELL BEING THAT'S WHY WE ASKED YOU TO COME. OF IT. THERE ARE. THE VICTIMS IN AN ON A ALL SIDES WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE WE HAVE. PEOPLE TRYING TO WORK FOR HARDEN SO MANY AND IF CONFRONTED WITH SO MANY ISSUES THEMSELVES- SO- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST- SHARING THAT WITH US AS WE BEGIN TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS. TO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE FACE WITH OUR OF OUR EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS WITH THE INMATES. OF A AND MAKING SURE THAT. WE DO WHATEVER WE CAN IN SUCH A VERY INTENSE. PROFESSIONS AND SOMEONE THANK YOU BOTH FOR. OF FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. THANK YOU YOU KNOW AND- AND BEING ABLE TO OF. CONTINUE TO WORK AND THAT'S THAT'S DIFFICULT I KNOW WE LOSE A LOT OF FOLKS NOT ONLY IN IN THE PRISONS BUT ALSO IN LAW ENFORCEMENT ITSELF THERE THE YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS HORRIBLE- IT AFFECTS EVERYBODY. IN SO THAT'S WHY WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE OF THE IMPACT. AS WELL AS PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT PEOPLE ME IN ON SO THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT IN OUR IN OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED GREATLY CONCERNED. QUE WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL- THAT'S MADE UP OF A PRISONER SUICIDES AND THIS WAS SOMEONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. ALSO MICHAEL BEHAN ROSEN BIEN GALVAN AND- ROME FELL THE CO COUNSELS ON COLD ONE VERSE NEWSOME AND ARMSTRONG VERSUS NEWSOME- AS WELL AS DOCTOR LAVERICK. NOT FREAKED. WHO'S A SENIOR PSYCHIATRIST AND SPECIALISES CDC OCT OKAY. FIRST OKAY. YOU CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON- MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY- I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND CART INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS MY NAME IS MICHAEL BEING. MY OFFICE IS CO COUNSEL FOR THE COLEMAN PLAINTIFF CLASS ALL PRISONERS OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE C. D. C. R. A CASE THAT'S BEEN PENDING BUT OR NOT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. SUICIDES ARE THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND SEE YOU SEE OURS THIRTY EIGHT SUICIDES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WAS A TRAGIC RECORD. THERE'S BEEN A MULTI YEAR TREND OF WORSENING RATES OF SUICIDES IN OUR PRISONS. CCAR'S TWENTY NINETEEN RATE OF SUICIDE WAS THIRTY POINT THREE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND ALMOST DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF SIXTEEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. THE RATE OF SUICIDES AND SEIZE YOUR PRISONS HAS SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED EACH YEAR FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS. OF THE RATE WAS SIXTEEN POINT NINE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOURTEEN. CCAR'S HOMICIDE RATE IS ALSO FAR HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL PRISON RAPE. TWENTY SEVEN OF THE THIRTY EIGHT PERSONS WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE IN TWENTY NINETEEN WERE COMMON CLASS MEMBERS SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. MANY HAD BEEN MOVED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE SUCH AS PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS BEDS IN HOSPITALS AND MONTHS BEFORE THEIR DATHS AND THEN DISCHARGED PRIOR TO THEIR SUICIDES. TEN OF THE SUICIDES RUN SEGREGATION. THE RATE OF SUICIDE SINCE IT'S CCR SEGREGATION UNITS REMAINS EXTREMELY HIGH. TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND. WELL CECE ARE SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR REDUCING ITS USE OF SEGREGATION IN THE AST FEW YEARS COLEMAN CLASS MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO SAID YOU SEE OUR CONSIDERS THE MOST SERIOUSLY ILL. ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE IN SEGREGATION AND OTHER PRISONERS AND OUR OUR FARM PLEADED DIED OF SUICIDE AND SEGREGATION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SEVEN OF THE TEN SEGREGATION SUICIDES WERE BY COMMON CLASS MEMBERS. CSP SACK EXPERIENCED NINE SUICIDES IN TWENTY NINETEEN FAR ABOVE ANY OTHER SINGLE PRISON IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. BUT ZACK HAS HAD A BAD RECORD FOR SUICIDE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS LEADING ALL CALIFORNIA PRISONS. SAC ALSO EXPERIENCED FIVE HOMICIDES IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND ONE SO FAR IN TWENTY TWENTY. AS WELL AS NUMEROUS STAFF ASSAULTS INCLUDING SOME VERY SERIOUS STABBINGS OF OFFICERS. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PRISON IN A DANGEROUS PRISON SYSTEM. HERE ARE SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS TWENTY NINETEEN SACKS SUICIDES ALL INE WERE COMMON CLASS MEMBERS AND EIGHT IN THE NINE RIGHT THE E. O. P. LEVEL OF CARE MEANING THEY NEEDED A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT UNIT. SIX OF THE NINE WERE IN SEGREGATION OR SOLITARY CONFINEMENT UNITS FOR EACH FOR. PEAS FIVE IN IN UNIT CALLED THE PS YOU AND ONE IN THE E. O. P. A. S. U. UNIT. ALL TREATMENT IN THESE UNITS ARE PROVIDED AND TREATMENT MODULES CAGES. WE PROVIDED PHOTOS OF TREATMENTS IN CAGES TO THE COMMITTEE WHICH WERE REPRODUCED IN THE AGENDA. WHILE SOME PATIENTS IN THESE UNITS HAVE TV'S. THE CABLE SYSTEM NEEDS REPAIR PLACEMENTS OF THE TV'S ARE USELESS. FOR THE NINE SUICIDES AT SAC INVOLVE RECENT DISCHARGES FROM A LICENSE PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS OR HOSPITAL UNIT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS. AND AS LITTLE AS FIVE HOURS BEFORE THE SUICIDE. SIX OF THE NINE SUICIDE HAVE BEEN RECENTLY HOSPITALIZED AT C. H. C. F. STOCKTON PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT PROGRAM. A NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FACILITY. WHICH IS COMPLETELY. WHICH IS TRANSFERRED FROM THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITAL TO SEE YOU SEE ARE OUT RECENTLY IN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SUICIDES WERE FORESEEABLE ARE PREVENTABLE EACH OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN ARE VALUABLE HUMAN BEINGS NONE OF THEM WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH AND NON DESERVE TO DIE. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU OUR OPINION AS THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE HIGH SUICIDE RATE AND SHE'S HERE TODAY. AND SUGGEST SOME INITIATIVES OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING PROBLEMS. FIRST DESPITE CDC OURS OVERALL COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWENTY ELEVEN UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION AND PLAZA. REQUIRING A REDUCTION OVERCROWDING TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT 5% THE COLEMAN CLASS REMAINS IN DANGEROUS IN OVERCROWDED CONDITIONS TODAY. THAT IS BECAUSE THE COMMON CLASS HAS NOT SHARED EQUALLY IN THE POPULATION REDUCTION CALIFORNIANS PRISONS. THERE ARE MORE CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE MORE COLEMAN CLASS MEMBERS IN OUR PRISONS TODAY THAN THEY WERE IN WHEN THE SUPREME COURT MADE ITS DECISION IN TWENTY ELEVEN. AND THEY ARE AT HIGHER ACUITY MEANING THEY REQUIRE MORE CLINICIANS AND MORE SPECIALIZED HOSPITAL BEDS. SINCE THE OVERALL PRISON POPULATION HAS DECLINED BY MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND. THE COMMON CLASSES NOW A FAR GREATER PERCENTAGE THE PRISON POPULATION WERE NOW ABOUT 30% CITIES YOUR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS I FELT PRESSURE TO PREMATURELY DISCHARGE COMMON CLASS MEMBERS FROM HOSPITAL BEDS AND TO LOWER THE LEVELS OF CARE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN. ON THE OVER CROWDED SYSTEM. SUICIDES HAVE RESULTED AT SAC AND ELSEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM FROM THIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE. THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM WELL BEYOND THE CAPACITY OF CGC OURS LIMITED CLINICAL RESOURCES. IT WILL TAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT LEAST SEVERAL MORE YEARS TO CONSTRUCT. SUFFICIENT SPECIALIZED PSYCHIATRIC BEDS TO MEET CURRENT DEMANDS. NOT INCLUDING THE REPLACEMENT OF INADEQUATE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIC BEDS THAT REMAIN IN USE TODAY. MORE THAN 25% OF THE ALLOCATED PSYCHIATRIST POSITIONS REMAIN VACANT. AND THEIR HIGH LEVELS OF VACANCIES IN OTHER CLINICAL DISCIPLINES SUCH AS SOCIAL WORKERS. THE SYSTEM IS IN A DANGEROUS SPIRAL CAREENING TOWARDS CATASTROPHE. THE CHARGES OF CLINICAL STAFF AND SPECIALIZED BEDS PUT MORE STRAIN ON THE EXISTING STAFF WHO ARE UNABLE TO TIMELY DELIVER CARE. BURN OUT AND TURNOVERS HIGH AND RECRUITMENT RETENTION OR OF REPLACEMENTS IS DIFFICULT. TO MAKE THINGS WORSE THE DELAYS MISTAKES MENTAL HEALTH CARE BECAUSE PATIENTS WHO SHOULD BEEN STABILIZED BE MORE PRONE TO DECOMPENSATION PSYCHOSIS AND HOSPITALIZATION. THE MORE STRAIN ON THE ALREADY OVER CLINICAL STAFF. SECOND LIFT AND SHIFT THE TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS THE CDC ARE FOR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS AND THREE PRISONS SALINAS VALLEY STOCKTON'S VACAVILLE. HAS BEEN IN MY OPINION A FAILURE NUMEROUS PATIENTS REQUIRING THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PSYCHIATRIC CARE RECEIVE LITTLE OR NO TREATMENT IN THE C. C. R. RUN PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SOME OF THEM DIED AS A RESULT. AS WE FEARED CCAR'S TURNING THESE EXPENSIVE LICENSE HOSPITALS INTO SEGREGATION UNITS WERE THE CLINICIANS ARE UNABLE TO BUY TREATMENT TO THE PATIENTS. CDC ARTS CURRENT PLAN IS TO INTRODUCE WHAT THEY CALL TREATMENT MODULES AND WE CALL CAGES INTO THE LICENSE HOSPITALS MAKING CONDITIONS FOR THE ACCU LEO PATIENTS EVEN WORSE. CAGING MENTALLY ILL HUMAN BEINGS FOR TREATMENT A PRACTICE THAT SHOCKED THE SUPREME COURT SO MUCH. THAT IT ATTACHED PICTURES OF THE CAGES TO ITS PUBLISHED OPINION TWENTY ELEVEN HAS NOT STOPPED IN FACT CAGES ARE NOT REQUIRED BY SHOULD YOU SEE OUR FOR EVERY MINUTE OF TREATMENT FOR EACH AND EVERY PATIENT. HOUSE IN CERTAIN SEGREGATION UNITS RESERVE FOR PRISONERS A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THE SOLUTION IS MORE TREATMENTS SUPPORTED BY APPROPRIATE STAFFING. TO ASSURE THE BOTH PATIENTS AND STAFF FOR SAFE. NO OTHER LICENSE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL USES CAGES FOR TREATMENT. THIRD CDC ARE HAS STILL NOT STILL FAIL TO COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION MODIFICATIONS PROCEDURES. THAT AGREED TO DO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN DESPITE REPEATED ORDERS OF THE COURT. THESE INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE FAILURES AND ROUNDING AND OBSERVATION BY COSTS THE OFFICERS IN NURSES YOURS AND SUICIDE RISK VALUATIONS AND SAFETY PLANNING BY CLINICIANS AND REPEATED FAILURES BY CLINICIANS AND CUTS THE OFFICERS TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. TO PATIENTS EXPRESSING RECITAL FAUCHER MAKING SUICIDAL GESTURES. PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL IS ADVOCATED FOR TRANSFERRING ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE FUNCTIONS TO THE PLOT A RECEIVER FROM C. C. R. AS A PATH FORWARD. TO YOU SEE OUR SEEM SIMPLY INCAPABLE OR UNWILLING TO FULLY IMPLEMENT ITS OWN COURT APPROVED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. FOURTH AS JUST EXPLAIN TODAY BY REPRESENTATIVES OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CCPOA. CITIES YOUR CUSTODIAL STAFF FOR OPERATING UNDER EXTREME STRESSORS. ARE THEMSELVES EXPERIENCING HIGH RATES OF SUICIDE. COSTLY OFFICERS SERVING IN OVERCROWDED AND UNDERSTAFFED SEE SEE OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS HAVE NO CLINICAL TRAINING BUT RESPONSIBLE FOR NUMEROUS DAILY FUNCTIONS. FOR ACUTELY ILL PATIENTS EXPERIENCING DECOMPENSATION. AND PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS AND BEHAVIORS. THE EXTREME BRUTALITY AND ABUSE BY CUTS THE OFFICERS DOCUMENTED A DONOVAN PRISON AND BY THE WAY IT'S A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE. ADDRESSED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN LAST WEEK'S HEARING WHEN MY COLLEAGUE DON SPECTER TESTIFIED. IS TO BE EXPECTED IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL AN OVERCROWDED PRISON SYSTEM. THE VICTIMS OF ABUSE DONOVAN OUR PRISONERS WITH DISABILITIES SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND OTHER MEDICAL AND PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS. AT SAC PRISON LEVELS OF SUICIDE VIOLENCE AGAINST PRISONERS AND CUSTODIAL STAFF ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL SIMILAR PROBLEMS ARE BEING REPORTED OTHER HIGH SECURITY PRISON SUCH AS CORCORAN SALINAS VALLEY IN LEC OVERCROWDING FIELD FEEDS A VICIOUS SPIRAL OF STRESS VIOLENCE LOCKDOWNS CANCEL PROGRAMMING ACTIVITIES LEADING TO MORE STRESS AND VIOLENCE EXACTLY WHAT THE CBO IT WAS TESTIFYING ABOUT. IN THESE CONDITIONS SYSTEMS A MENTAL ILLNESS WILL GET WORSE INCREASING DEMANDS ON BOTH CLINICAL IN CUSTODY STAFF AND THE NEED FOR PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION. UNNECESSARY AND AVOIDABLE DEATHS BY SUICIDE AND HOMICIDE HAVE RESULTED. FINALLY FAR TOO MANY PRISONERS A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE HOUSED IN HARSH AND INHUMANE SEGREGATION UNITS FOR FAR TOO LONG WITHOUT OF CELL TIME AVERAGING LESS THAN THREE HOURS A DAY. THESE UNITS EVEN THOSE DESIGNED FOR COMMON CLASS MEMBERS ARE PRIMARILY PLACES OF PUNISHMENT AND CONTAINMENT NOT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. CDC ARE STILL FAILS TO PROPERLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN ITS DISCIPLINARY PROCESS BEHAVIOR RELATED TO SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. BOTH THE BEHAVIOR AND THE MENTAL ILLNESS ARE EXACERBATED BY HER SEGREGATION HOUSING. SACKS TWENTY NINE. TEEN HORRIFIC YEAR OF TRAGEDY IN DEATH AS A RESULT OF THESE POLICIES. THESE ARE SEVERAL THERE ARE SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO THAT WE RECOMMEND. FIRST CAMERAS MUST BE PROMPTLY INSTALLED AT ALL CALIFORNIA PRISONS BEGINNING WITH A HIGH SECURITY PRISONS. BODY CAMERA SHOULD BE PURCHASED REQUIRED TO BE WORN USED BY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. HAMMERS ARE PROVEN TO REDUCE VIOLENCE HELP CONTROL THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF ILLEGAL DRUGS AND REDUCE OVERDOSE DEATHS. CAMERAS WILL ALSO BRING FAIRNESS THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR PRISONERS AND ALSO PROTECT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS FROM UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS. IT IS INEXCUSABLE THE CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS REMAIN VIRTUALLY CAMERA FREE. SEE C. R. NUMBER TWO C. C. R. AS BEING PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH AND IT'S INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN CLINICAL STAFFERS MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. THE LEGISLATURE MUST REQUIRES CDC ARE TO FILL ITS VACANT POSITIONS. ESPECIALLY PSYCHIATRISTS. BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING SALARY BENEFITS IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS TARGETED BONUSES LOAN FORGIVENESS AND OTHER CREATIVE STRATEGIES MUST BE CONSIDERED. THIS IS A COMPETITIVE MARKET THE CDC OUR PEERS STEP GIVEN UP. THREE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DEMAND A REPORT FROM CDC ARE AND IT'S INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC PROGRAMS THAT TOOK OVER D. S. H. AND MAKE CLEAR THAT IT WILL NOT FUND OR PROVE THE INSTALLATION OF CAGES FOR TREATMENT IN LICENSE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS. FOR CBC ARE MUST BE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS IN HARSH SEGREGATION UNITS IN HIGH SECURITY HOSPITAL UNITS. BY ASSURING ACCESS TO WORKING ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES SUCH AS TV'S AND RADIOS AND PERSONAL PROPERTY. ADDITIONAL STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO REDUCE OR BANNED THE USE OF SEGREGATION FOR PRISONERS ARE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. SHE'S HERE OFFICIALS HAVE RECENTLY VISITED NORWAY TO OBSERVE AND STUDY A PRISON SYSTEM THAT TRULY FOCUSES ON REHABILITATION NOT PUNISHMENT. LEGISLATURE SHOULD FIND MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO SEGREGATION POLICY THAT FLOW FROM THIS LEARNING PROCESS. FINALLY LEGISLATURE SHOULD FUND AND ENCOURAGE YOU SEE ARE TO INCREASE EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND RE ENTRY SERVICES FOR THE COMMON CLASSES DURING FOR EXAMPLE THAT HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE IN PLACE BEFORE JUST CHARGE. AND THAT WE PUT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO THAT SAFE AND APPROPRIATE AT WITH ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DIANA TASHA. OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. AND I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON ON THE SUPPORT AND TALKED TOPIC. AT CDC ARE SUICIDE AS A MATTER OF FACT HE TAKES SERIOUSLY BOTH AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND AS HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS IN CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. AND WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THE CARE OF ALL OUR PATIENTS. I WANT TO REITERATE CLEARLY ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT. THAT ONE SUICIDE ALONE IS ONE SUICIDE TOO MANY. AT CDC ARE CONTINUES TO CAREFULLY EXAMINE EACH INCIDENT FOR LESSONS AND INSIGHTS ON HOW WE CAN PREVENT THESE TRAGEDIES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. SUICIDE IS A CRISIS OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS INSIDE OUR PRISONS AND SUICIDE IS REACHING EPIDEMIC LEVELS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY INCLUDINGIN MANY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE MILITARY. THE MOST CONCERNING FOR US. BEAN HAS MENTIONED THAT TO SIDE HAS STEADILY INCREASED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRESS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE TO SAID OCCURS EACH SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPT CREATES A SIGNIFICANT RIPPLE EFFECT. THAT IMPACTS STAFF. OTHER INMATES. I DO IN ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF SUICIDE DEALING WITH THE AFTERMATH AND IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO BE PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING SUICIDE IN PRISON AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A FEW THE INITIATIVES. CITIES HERE CONTINUES TO STRIVE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU SHORT OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO DEVELOPING A ROBUST SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM EMPLOYING NATIONALLY ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS. UNLIKE BEFORE WE PROVIDER STAFF BOTH HEALTH CARE AND CUSTODY WITH MANDATORY SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING EACH YEAR WE ENSURE ALL POTENTIAL FIRST RESPONDERS ARE TRAINED IN EMERGENCY PROCEDURES AND LIFESAVING SKILLS SUCH AS CPR AND BASIC LIFE SUPPORT AND WE EXTENSIVELY TRAIN OUR TALENTED AND DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT. SORRY AND WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR IDENTIFYING AT RISK INMATES AND REFERRING THEM TO RECEIVE PROPER CARE WE REGULARLY REACH OUT TO OUR INMATES VIçT VIDEOS PAMPHLETS AND INSTITUTIONAL EVENTS TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT INMATES MIGHT BE HAVING AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM IF THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES. IN AN INSTANCE. OF AN INMATE'S SUICIDE THE DEPARTMENT COMPLETES A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI DIPS DISCIPLINARY REVIEW BY HEALTH CARE AND CUSTODY STAFF. FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS OPERATION. THIS PROCESS IS MONITORED BY THE FEDERAL COURT AND THE DEPARTMENTS POST SUICIDE REVIEWS ARE RIGOROUS RESOURCE INTENSIVE. COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSIDERED THE GOLD STANDARD OF SUICIDE REVIEWS. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES A THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THE PROPER APPLICATION OF CURRENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WITH THE GOAL OF DETERMINING WHAT IMPROVEMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCES OF SUICIDE IN SOME INSTANCES. WE FIND THE NEED FOR PROOF LOCAL TRAINING. IN OTHERS REVISION TO LOCAL PROCEDURES AND WE WERE DESPERATE WE DIRECT THE INSTITUTION. TO COMPLETE A MONITOR TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE IN OTHER INSTANCES WE FIND AREAS OF POTENTIAL STAFF MISCONDUCT. AND REFER REFER THOSE TO OUR OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR DIRECT DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR INVESTIGATION. AS YOU KNOW IS MISTER BE MENTIONED CSP SACK IN PARTICULAR HAS SEEN IN EXTREMELY DISTRESSING INCREASING IT INCREASE IN SUICIDES. AS A JUST IN FEBRUARY CDC ARTS CENTER MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM TO PERFORM AN INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW OF EXISTING OPERATIONS AND PROGRAMS AND ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW WHERE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL SPECIAL MASTERS TEAM AS WELL AS- A MEMBER FROM MR BEANS LAW FIRM. THIS TEAM'S GOAL WAS TO AND CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS THAT WERE LEADING TO THE INCREASED SUICIDE THAT SOCK AND TO THEN DEVELOP AN ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE FACTORS. A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES WERE IDENTIFIED TO HELP IMPROVE SEIZE THE SACK SUCH AS HAVING GREATER SOCIALIZATION FOR PATIENTS AND CHANGES TO MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO DISCUSS CD ZERO SIX THAT THE PROVIDER PREVENTIVE MEASURES AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THERE'S AN ANNUAL SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING FOR ALL STAFF ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINES. INCLUDING CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. THIS TRAINING HAS RECENTLY BEEN RECENTLY UPDATED WITH APPROVAL AND INPUT FROM THE LONG TIME FEDERAL COURT MONITOR. CDC ARE HAS IMPLEMENTED CRISIS. INTERVENTION TEAMS WHICH ARE MULTIPLE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS CONSISTING OF CUSTODY AND HEALTH CARE STAFF. THE GOAL OF THE CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM IS TO PROVIDE TIMELY. AND RESPONSE OF CRISIS INTERVENTION STRATEGIES TO HELP QUICKLY RESOLVE PATIENT ISSUES BEFORE THEY ESCALATE. ISSUES CAN INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE MEDICATION ISSUES PROPERTY ISSUES AND CHANGES TO HOUSING FOR THE FOR THE INMATE ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES BEFORE THEY ESCALATE OFTEN PREVENT THEM FROM ESCALATED TO CRISIS LEVELS. ALSO WHEN A PATIENT WHEN AN INMATE IS PLACED IN SEGREGATED HOUSING THERE TO BE PLACED IN RED OF RETRO FITTED INTAKE CELLS WHICH ARE MODIFIED TO PREVENT LEGIT LITERATURE TYPE POINTS. THIS PRACTICE WAS INSTITUTED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE FEDERAL COURT EXPERT ON SUICIDE PREVENTION AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ADDITIONAL CELL RETROFITS AT FOURTEEN INSTITUTIONS. FOR STAFF WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES A HEALTHY STAFF WILL HELP MAINTAIN HEALTHY PATIENTS AND SO WE HAVE THE CDC OUR PEER SUPPORT PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AND GOALS FOR THE STANDARDIZATION IS TO TRAIN CITIES ARE EMPLOYEES TO CARE FOR FELLOW EMPLOYEES AFTER SIGNIFICANT EVENT AS WELL AS FOR DAY TO DAY CHALLENGES THAT INDIVIDUAL SPACE. WE ALSO HAVE STRESS RESILIENCY TRAINING WHICH IS A ONE HOUR ON THE JOB TRAINING FOR STAFF TO PROVIDE COPING AND RESILIENCY TOOLS TO EXIST IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON THE BODY. AND WE ALSO HAVE ENGAGE WITH DOES OUR WATERS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. TIME TO THE SYSTEM WELL OF CORRECTION STAFF BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE EVIDENCE INFORMED RESOURCES. AND SUPPORTS. SO AS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR ISSUED A REPORT IN AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND I FOUND THAT CDC ARE NEEDED TO INCREASE ITS EFFORTS IN PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO INMATE SUICIDES IN AMONG THE INITIATIVES IDENTIFIED THAT NEEDED ATTENTION IMPROVEMENT WERE. TRAINING AND MENTORING OF STOPPED TO SUPPORT THEM IN RESPONDING TO SUICIDES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF KEEP POLICIES TO DIRECT STAFF IN HOW TO DO SUICIDES AND REGULAR AUDITING TO ENSURE OUR STAFF COMPLY WITH RISK EVALUATION AND TREATMENT PLANTS. ARE KEY TO HOW WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING AN IMPROVING OUR PROCESS SEES. BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR CONTINUED PHILIP VIGILANCE AND INCREASED IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PROCESS SEES AND ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THOSE DEFICIENCIES. AND IS PENSION PREVIOUSLY AS A STATE WE NEED TO ADDRESSMENTAL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS IN PERSON. AND TO SAY PREVENTION BEGINS IN COMMUNITIES IN HOMES NOT AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL COMES TO PRESENT. THERE MUST BE A MULTI PRONGED EFFORT AT ALL LEVELS INSIDE AS WELL AS OUTSIDE OF PRISON TO ENSURE WE'RE ABLE TO TREAT THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS WHILE IN THE MIDST OF THEIR DESPAIR. AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAKES BOLD STEPS TO MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION AND HELPING INDIVIDUALS MANAGE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. SO MEDI CAL HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL INITIATIVE THIS INITIATIVE SEEKS TO COORDINATE AND INTEGRATE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVELY AND PROVIDE MORE SERVICES. THAT SUPPORT PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX POSITION THE STATE TO BETTER CONNECT INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND INDIVIDUALS% EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. AND THE JUSTICE INVOLVED WITH THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED MAKING THESE CONNECTIONS WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THESE INDIVIDUALS HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IN ADDITION THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WILL FIND COUNTY OPERATED COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SYSTEMS. THIS WILL HELP SPEARHEAD SYSTEM CHANGES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL INCLUDING DATA SHARING FOR CARE COORDINATION TO ENSURE QUICK RESPONSE TO ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BEFORE THEY MEN'S MANIFEST INTO SUICIDE SUICIDAL TENDENCIES. AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES A RADICAL SHIFT IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IT LAUNCHES A NEW STATE FUND FOR DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AUGMENTING RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND STABILIZE IMPORTANT CARE HOMES. AND THE GOVERNOR IS ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE EARLY ACTION ON ESTABLISHING THIS FUND SO THAT THE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS ARE READY TO BE DEPLOYED IN THE SUMMER. CITIES YOUR VIEWS THESE MEASURES TWO WAYS. FIRST IS A SYSTEM THAT CAN CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL IN THE COMMUNITY SO THEY DON'T COME TO PRESENT. AND SECOND AS A SYSTEM THAT CAN SUPPORT OUR PATIENT POPULATION AFTER BEING RELEASED SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO RETURN TO PRISON. THANK YOU. I'M GOOD EVENING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE MY NAME'S INNOVATE MON I MISS. OF WORK FOR SEIZE THEIR FOR NINE YEARS I HAVE HAD VEGAS BUT WITH CITY SEE OUR WORK DEADLINES BY DIRECT PATIENT AND ALSO INVOLVE IN POLICY DECISIONS AND DISCUSSIONS- ABOUT HEADQUARTERS SO WANT TO START BY TELLING EVERYONE PSYCHIATRISTS- ARE MEDICAL DOCTORS WHO HAVE COMPLETED MEDICAL SCHOOL JUST LIKE YOUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS YOU'RE A CARDIOLOGISTS- YOUR PEDIATRICIAN'S. FOLLOWED BY FOR YOUR SPECIALTY TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY. AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CDC ARE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE NINETEEN NINETY TWO COLEMAN FEDERAL COURT CASE LAST OCTOBER FEDERAL JUDGE MILLER MADE A STATEMENT THAT TRULY CAPTURED SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES AND CITIES ARE MENTAL HEALTH. SHE SAID THAT CITIES HERE ADOPTED A LASER FOCUS IN AN EFFORT TO OBTAIN TERMINATION OF COURT TO THE PENSION AND IT APPEARS TO HAVE LOST COMPLETE SIDE OF THE REASONS THAT THE MEDIATION WAS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO REMINDED US THAT LEGAL CASES HAVE HEARTS AND SOULS ABOUT MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS HOUSE BEHIND BARS HAVE THE UNDENIABLE RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONALLY ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. SUICIDES AND CDC ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG CD SALES FOCUS ON FROM UNDER FEDERAL OVERSIGHT HAS LED TO SOME WARPED PRIORITIES. THE POLICY AND WILL FIND TO MAKE NUMBERS GOOD COVER UP THE DEAL IT'S SUCH AS INADEQUATE. IS THAT FOR STAFF TO MAKE BACK DECISION. I ABLE ON. STAFF TO MAKE MEDI TREAT AND MEDICAL STANDARD OF TO SAYS. MEANT THAT BALL. MOMENT IN AND THESE POLICY ENABLE TO MINIMIZE OF PHYSICIAN INVOLVEMENT IN PATIENT. STAFFERS SAID I FOR FAILURE CDC ARE NOT KIND OF FINE PROBLEM POLICY AND FOR. THAT ARE FREE MISS AND TO. THEY WERE THIRTY EIGHT COMPLY SO IT'S AND SEE YOUR INTO NINETY AS MY- IF AN ALARM THESE ON INCREASE. I RECENTLY. TO FIVE OF THINKING BECAUSE I THOUGHT TIME FOR ALL OF THEM OCCURRED WITHIN DAYS TO MY AFTER THE PATIENT'S MOUTH LEVEL OF CARE. MOST WOULD HAVE BENEFIT FOM C. AFFECT SOONER THAN WAS REQUIRED BY PAUL. I BELIEVE THE ARKANSAS HAVE BEEN TO IF THE MAKING THE TRIP DECISION DIDN'T FEEL PRESSURE TO DO THE BAY MINIMUM. AND IF WE FOLLOW COMING STANDARD I WON A DOG BREED ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S. EIGHTEEN INCOMPETENT CONSCIENCE PSYCHOTIC. IS OUR VIEW PROBLEM NOT. THEM WE CANNOT RETAIN PSYCHIATRIST BECAUSE HE YOUR ALLOWS NON MET STAFF OVERRULE PHYSICIAN DECISION I WORKING FIRST SANTA CHOIRS IF DEGREE OF COUPLE. THAT ALLOW OF SECOND JUST CANNOT HANDLE ORDER CHOIRS WITH TO FIGHT SYSTEM WHICH OCT BONE MOST OF OUT AND HAS POTENTIAL FOR IT WITHOUT A DONALD VIGILANCE THE SYSTEM REVERTS TO UNSAFE PRACTICES CDC ARE BLAMES THE AS SO ON INTO. JUDGE MILLER IDENT. LAST YEAR AGAIN BUT THE EXTRA. AND IT. ADDITIONAL X. IN. THE WOULD BE FOR HER. AND I'M- THIS WORK. THAT DOES NOT VALUE THE ESSENTIAL PRESS THAT PSYCHOLOGY HAVE TO. AND CREATES AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE MORAL IS LOW. THE ON PORTS REALITY IS FOR OVER TWO FIVE YEARS OF PEACE THAT SUFFER AND STATE HASN'T SAVE ANY MONEY. WE NEED CHANGE OUR CULTURE AND AMID A INTO TO. WE MUST ADDRESS THE SCOPE OF BACK IS TO THAT AND GOT IT ON CALL STAFF TO OVER TEN MEDICAL DECISION. WE NEED TO EMPOWER TOOK OUR- AND TELL IN POLICY DECISION WHICH THEY IN OP. TO EXISTING STANDARDS FOR SO PREVENTION AND PSYCHIATRIC CARE. UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THESE ACTIONS ARE PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER AND WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE FOR PATIENT OUTCOMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME. OKAY. YES SO I WHEN I WAS TO OF THIS COMMITTEE I REMEMBER TRYING TO GET BODY CAMERAS OF FOR ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE DID- WE DID A STUDY THERE WERE ONE YEAR TWO YEAR STUDY SO THAT WE CAN DETERMINE HOW MANY HOW MUCH THE COST OF DATA- AND- WE STILL DON'T HAVE. H. P. WOOD WOOD BODY CAMERAS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THAT AND-% IT'S A I DON'T THINK. STE OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL HAS COME HERE TO YOU TO ASK FOR BODY CAMERAS I DON'T KNOW IF CDC OURS COME TO THIS COMMITTEE ASKED FOR BODY CAMERAS AS A PART OF IT IS YOU GOT ASK. AND YOU HAD A WARNING. AND SO I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT DISCUSSION GOES TO HEADED DEPARTMENT SAID A WEEK IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY TO NEEDS NEEDED ONE YOU'VE GOT YOU GOT ASKED FOR TO BE ABLE TO GET IT- UP TO I. DID THE WHOLE. SYSTEM OF SUICIDES IN THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF IT BUT DO YOU YOU HAVE MORE DATA ON- THE CORRECTION OFFICERS TODAY HERE IT IS A SPIKE. BUT IN A NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THEY'RE ALSO HAVING IT'S SUICIDE WHICH TELLS YOU THAT IT'S JUST IT'S NOT JUST THE INMATES IN GIVING THEM WHAT THEY NEED. ALL THAT THEIR SUPERVISING THEM KEEPING THEM SAFE FROM PROTECTION PRODUCTION FROM EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT HAVE WEEK EVERYFULLY. GONE INTO MAYBE LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT. ARM THE HAVE THE STIGMA OF GOING TO SEE OF A METAL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL- MIGHT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOUR CAREER MIGHT NOT BE GOOD. FOR YOU TO WORK WITH SOMEONE ELSE M. THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF DOING THINGS WE MAY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOX AND NOT JUST A STANDARD WHAT. THIS PERSON IS AN ADULT AND THAT IS DONE OTHERWISE. YOU'LL SEE YOU YOU MAY START TO SEE THE END MAYES GO DOWN IN NUMBER SUICIDE BUT I THINK IT'S JUST AS APPALLING. THAT WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS- SUICIDE THEY'RE GOING UP AND SO HAVE. AND WE REALLY ADDRESS THAT COULD THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. THERE THAT WE- WE DEFINITELY NEED TO ADDRESS. OKAY YEAH I BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE JUST TIME SO TEN AB I THERE MAY A FEW OF YOU WANTED TO PUBLIC ON THE SURE IF LEFT. ONE WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE. SOUNDS GOOD. OKAY I'M SO YEAH NO I DO THE WANT TO A LITTLE BIT AND- YES OUR PRESENCE IS IN JAIL SO CALIFORNIA BECOME CA OF A TO MEADOW HOUSES WHICH IS WHICH IS INEXCUSABLE. BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ABOUT THE LACK OF REHABILITATION IS PART AND PARCEL TO THIS CONVERSATION WE HAVE I THINK YOU SERIOUS CULTURAL ISSUE WITHIN CDC ARE THAT PROBABLY LEADS TO A LOT OF THE OUTCOMES ULTIMATELY THAT WE'RE- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK INCLUDING. DOCTOR YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT. PHYSICIANS OR PSYCHIATRISTS WHO ARE TRYING TO BE A PART OF THE SYSTEM. AND TO GET OVER RULES ARE OVER RUN BUT I JUST. SO THERE'S REALLY A LOT HERE TO THAT I THINK FOR US TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND LOOK FOR. BUT JUST IN THE TESTIMONY AND THE STUFF THAT IT'S COME COME ALONG FOR CDC ARE. WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD BE THE THERAPEUTIC BASIS FOR. THE CAGES AND FOR TRYING TO. EVEN TEMPORARILY PUTTING SOMEBODY IN A CAGE AS PART OF THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAM AND DOESN'T THAT ABSOLUTELY AND DO WHAT EVER ELSE MIGHT BE BEING TRIED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THAT SESSION AS I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE NOT THERE FOR THAT'S NOT THEIR PERMANENT PLACE BUT THERE THERE IT ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTATION HERE. FOR THEIR THERAPEUTIC. APPOINTMENTS OR OR ENGAGEMENT AT HOW IT ALL. IS THAT CONDUCIVE TO ADDRESSING ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT IN MAY MAY HAVE. SO WE HAVE WE CDC ARE HAS UTILIZED THE THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MODULES FOR. A NUMBER OF YEARS I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE AND- WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WITH THE PLAINTIFFS AND SPECIAL MASTER ALTERNATIVES FOR- TREATMENT. AND THEY WERE WERE USED THEM TO KEEP THE BOTH THE INMATE AND THE STAFF SAFE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- IT'S NOT SAFE FOR OTHER FOR OTHER ENGAGEMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME. SEE HOW ANY PROGRESS CAN BE MADE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN THEY'RE RECEIVING TREATMENT. AND IF IT'S IN A CAGE LIKE THAT I'VE SEEN THOSE I DON'T THINK I COULD EVEN STAND UP IN ONE LET ALONE NECESSARILY EVEN SIT IN ONE. JUST GIVEN MY SIZE SO IT'S REALLY ASTONISHING TO ME TO SEE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING USED AND IS CURRENTLY A MAJOR PART OF HOW. TREATMENT AND I SORT OF EVEN HATE TO USE THE WORD GETS DELIVERED. EVEN IN A DIFFICULT CITING LACK OF PRESENCE SO I DID I THINK THIS REALLY UNDERSCORES WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE GUARDS WHAT WE HEAR FROM THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN CUSTODY IN OUR PRISONS AB YES THERE IS A SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE ACROSS SOCIETY AND THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE TREATING PEOPLE IN OUR CUSTODY IN OUR CARE. IN WHAT WAS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT AND IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE CITY SEE ARE BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES GIVEN UP ON THE THERAPEUTIC COMPONENTS SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE INCLUDING SOME SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL CHANGES. WITH WITHIN THE SYSTEM SO I JUST FOR ME I'M IN. I CAN'T SAY THAT I'M HAPPY-THIS IS COME TO US AND THAT WILL BRING IN UP BUT I AM GLAD WE'RE ASKING QUESTIONS WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS. BECAUSE THIS IS THE SYSTEM WE ARE FUNDING. AND I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN EXPECT THINGS TO CHANGE WITHIN THAT SYSTEM EVEN AS WE TRY TO WORK ON A LARGER SOCIETAL ISSUES. WITH THAT THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THEY EXIST. I MADE SOME HOW EFFECTIVE BUT LET ME BILLS WOULD STAY WE CAN BE A ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS DOUGLAS CHIP OUT ON BAIL OF THE AFTER LOCAL A SIX UNION AMERICAN. AND DENTISTS GIVEN LATENESS OF THE HOUR WE NUMEROUS PHYSICIANS HERE AND SECOND.

THE IS THE DON'T WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY IMPROVEMENTS OR HERE IN A LOT OF TALK BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING MANY IMPROVEMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK ALL OF YOU WHO CAME TODAY. AND YOU KNOW IT IT- AND I'VE SEEN THE CAGES AT THE END WHEN I WAS A DONOVAN RECENTLY. WE I CALL FOR THIS HEARING BECAUSE OF- MY DEEP CONCERN AS I WATCHED THE NUMBERS RISE. OF THAT WHILE WE WERE DRESSING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN TERMS OF REHABILITATION AND- VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF- ISSUES REGARDING STAFFING OR WHATEVER WAS. THAT WE WERE ONCE AGAIN MISSING SOME CRITICAL ELEMENTS AS TO WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO PREVENT IT- END OF MY COLLEAGUE IS MR STONE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE'VE GOT A CULTURAL. ISSUE THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY WITH REGARDS TO INCARCERATION. AND EVEN WITH OUR BEST EFFORTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD TO REDUCE THE POPULATION AND DO A VARIETY OF THINGS WE STILL HAVE. OF SOME ENORMOUS CHALLENGES- THAT ARE SO EMBEDDED IN OUR SYSTEM- THAT IT IS A TOXIC ENVIRONMENT THAT ONLY FOR OUR- INMATES BUT ALSO FOR EMPLOYEES. AND WE HAVE TO SOME POINT ADDRESS THAT YOU KNOW. TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE DO AROUND THE WORLD BEING SOMEWHAT SUB ON TO OTHER PLACES AND LOOK AT PRISON VITAMINS. AND SEE SOMETIMES A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF REALITY YOU KNOW THE LENGTH OF STAY PEOPLE ARE SAYING OUR PRISONS ARE SO LONG THAT IT. DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS THEIR THEIR MENTAL STATE IN THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE THERE- I. YOU KNOW IT'S SO IT'S REALLY I'M IT'S BOTHERING ME PERSONALLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE GET IN OUR MENTALITY WE PROMOTE CERTAIN THINGS WITHOUT ACTUALLY SAYING SO. YOU KNOW I- WHEN I WAS DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF LETHAL FORCE- I BEGAN TO NOTICE IN SO MANY WAYS HOW WE PROMOTE. OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE IN IN IN LONG. OF IT WAS JUST LOOKING AT TV GRAMS LIGHT THE BLUE BLOOD IN SOME OF THESE OTHERS WERE. IT IT BEEN COPLEY THE IS ONE BE BEAT UP GET IN FOR OUT OF THEM OR WHAT IT MAY BE AND WE WHAT'S THAT IS IN A TWO WITHOUT OUTRAGE AND SO THE AND SOMEHOW ANOTHER THE SUB CONSCIOUS LEVEL. WE SUPPORT THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT OCCURS IN AN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AS I SAID THE OTHER TIME WE HAD A HEARING LAST WEEK I SAID IT IT BOTHERS ME WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAY WHOEVER'S BEEN ARRESTED AND WHOEVER IS GOING TO BE COULD BE. SENT TO PRISON THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME JONES GIRLFRIEND. NOW THAT PROMOTE SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN PRISONS I MEAN AND PEOPLE LEARN TO EXPECT THAT. AND TOLERATED- I WAS. MEETING WITH ONE OF OUR OUR SERGEANTS AFTER MY LAST HEARING AND HE WAS TELLING ME HE HAD A MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY THAT WAS INCARCERATED. AND THE BRUTALITY THAT THIS YOUNG MAN HAD IN DOOR. AND EVENTUALLY JOINED A GANG TO PROTECT HIMSELF YOU KNOW IN THIS ENVIRONMENT AND SO HE'S TELLING ME THIS STORY. AND HE'S HE SAID LISTEN TO SOME OF THE THINGS IN AND HE WAS DRIVING ME I EITHER TO THE AIRPORT OF YET OR FROM THE AIRPORT WHEN I DON'T REMEMBER LAST WEEK. BUT IN IN ANY EVENT. HE HE'S HE'S SEEING IN HIS OWN FAMILY THE KIND OF. OF TRAUMA THAT EXIST WHEN A PERSON IS INCARCERATED. AND WAS SAYING TO ME YOU KNOW WHAT THE THIS YOUNG MAN RIGHTS. MY MOTHER'S LETTERS AND SAYS IT WAS IT WAS A STEP BROTHER HE SAID. AND I'M JUST A SHAME OF THE THINGS I'VE HAD TO DO IN HERE TO SURVIVE. YOU KNOW SO WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT STUFF SOMETIMES THAT THINGS ARE SO EMBARRASSING. THAT THEY AS A PERSON HAS ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN TO THEM. JUST TO STAY ALIVE THAT- IT WE HAVE IT MAKES IS WE HAVE TO RETHINK OUR INCARCERATION WE HAVE TO RETHINK. THE CULTURE THAT'S THE- YOU KNOW. I WAS LOOKING AT SOME MOVIE THE OTHER NIGHT IN THE SO. THEY HAD THEY WERE BEATING UP ON THIS GUY- AND- AND THE GUARD WAS IN AT HIS DESK HEARING IT. NOT STOPPING IT BUT HEARING IT. BECAUSE THAT'S THE EXPECTATION THAT THOSE FOLKS WILL BEAT UP ON EACH OTHER AND SO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF. OF VIOLENCE IN AND FEAR AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT THEY'RE IN SO YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE MENTAL STATE THAT A PERSON. LIVES IN WHEN THEY'RE IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT AND THAT WE SAW THE REPORT TO CAME OUT AND SO. WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS ISSUE AND I CAN CITY PERSONALLY BOTHERS ME. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SUICIDE SOME THINKING WELL. YOU KNOW WE'RE WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR FOLKS NOT WORSE. YOU KNOW OF THESE OF FOLKS WALKED THE STREETS EVERY DAY AND WOULDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE. THEY GO ON TO OUR PLACE. AND THEY DO OR MEMBERS. FEAR COULD NOT AS THE- CO. THAT THERE IN AND AS A RESULT IT'S TEARING THEM APART INSIDE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHO THEY WANT TO BE AND MANY A MARTY ARE QUITTING OR DOING WHATEVER THEY'RE GOING TO DO. AND IT'S A DIRECTLY AFFECTING THEIR FAMILY THEIR FAMILY LIFE FOR ME. THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT I MEAN YOU KNOW SO. AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE HUGE NUMBERS AND THE FACILITIES AND HOW THEY LOOK IN ALL THESE THINGS. IT IS REALLY- IT'S ALARMING YOU KNOW AND INTERESTING TO ME I HAVE BEEN TO. ALMOST A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NOT HOME WAS ALL THE PRISON IN CALIFORNIA. NOT AS A LEGISLATOR BUT WHEN I WAS A TWENTY TWENTY YEAR OLD SINGER I USED TO GO SING IN PRISONS. AND IT BOTHERED ME THAT YOU KNOW TO THE GOAL BUT I'D GO BECAUSE THESE GUYS ARE SO HAPPY TO SEE FOLKS COME. AND GIVE THEM SOME ENTERTAINMENT DURING A AND THOSE WHO WERE- HAD BEEN GOOD GOT A CHANCE TO GO BUT- BUT I SAW ALL THE YOU KNOW THE CAJUN OF INDIVIDUALS AND EVENTUALLY IT WORKED ON. I GOT TO PROVIDE LIKE TO GO BUT I WOULD GO SOMETIMES- BECAUSE IT IS A IT IS NOT A HEALTHY PLACE TO BE. AND THAT WAS YEARS AGO WHEN WE DIDN'T INCARCERATE AS MANY PEOPLE BEEN CARS RIGHT NOW. IS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE SO THIS IS A TOTALLY AND SO YOU GO IN THERE NOW. AND IT IS. I MEAN IT'S NOT A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT. AND NOT THAT HE WOULD WANT TO SET REALISTIC PRISON SO ONE FOR ABOUT ONE GOAL NO ONE WANT TO GO ANYWAY. BUT AT LEAST IT CAN BE A PLACE WHERE YOU GOAL. AND YOU'RE NOT OF. FOR YOUR LIFE. EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW AND I'VE HAD. MOTHERS SO IN CHURCH COME IN ASK FOR PRAYERS BECAUSE SON TO GOING TO HAVE TO. MAJOR SURGERY. ALL WAS SOMETHING THAT HAVE. AND THEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PRISON AND SO. AND WATCH THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE NOT. THIS WE PEOPLE COMING TELL ABOUT THE GLADIATORS AND THE WHATEVER BLANKS AT THE- ORGAN I IN THE PRISONS. WHAT KIND OF CRAZY THIS IS THIS YOU KNOW I- AND YET WE KNOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN. AND LET THEM COME. IT'S VERY ALONG TO I'M AND I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU DISMANTLE. SUCH A SYSTEM AND REBUILD IT BUT SOMEHOW ANOTHER WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO BECAUSE EVEN IF WE REDUCE OUR POPULATION IF THE FOLKS WILL COMING OUT HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS KIND OF WORLD. IT CHANGES WHO THEY ARE IN THE WORST KIND OF WAY RATHER THAN THE BEST KIND OF WAY. AND I'VE I'VE I HAVE GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR EMPLOYEES WHO ALSO NOW EXPERIENCING THE KIND OF TRAUMA THE PTSD OR WHATEVER IT IS WORKING IN THAT ENVIRONMENT AND HAVING TO MAKE PEACE WITH THEMSELVES OUT LOOKING AT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HERE AND WAS ALMOST IN TEARS JUST TO DISCUSS WHAT SHE HAS SEEN. OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF AS AN AND A GENTLEMAN AS WELL I MEAN YOU YOU ENJOY THAT KIND OF VISION AND YOU IMMEDIATE I THINK OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN AND WHO'VE BEEN IN VIETNAM AND THE NIGHTMARES THAT THEY HAVE AND THE THINGS THAT OCCUR IN THEIR LIVES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT. SO WE HAVEGOT TO DO SOMETHING AT YOU KNOW AND I I'M NOT SURE. WHAT IT IS BUT AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WHICH WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS WE'VE GOT TO GO SOME OTHER PLACE AND SEE WHAT THE PEOPLE DUE. TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND PLACES WILL WHERE ARE SO RIGHT TO DO THAT. AT ROLE AND GET BETTER. READ THESE FEARFUL TRAPS THAT ARE IN I GET THE SENSE THAT ARE YOU'LL PLEASE IF YOU COULD SURVIVE PRISON PROBABLY CORRECT BUT BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT INVITE BUT THEY'RE PUTTING BOOKS IT IS REALLY. REALLY TOXIC FOR EVERY ONE AND I'M WE'VE GOT TO FIND A SOLUTION. WE'VE ACT OF SOLUTION THERE IS NO CARRYING ON FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS WE ARE THE FINAL XIN WHAT I'M DOING. OTHER IS THE SOLUTION. WE HAVE. AND THAT. BOTHERS ME THE THIS IS THAT IT'S NOT. ONLY NOT SIGN GO THE OTHER PLACE IS. IT IS BAD IT IN EVERYTHING THEY WHETHER FROM. FROM LA SCHOOL OF UP AND HOW THEY TREAT EACH OTHER AND THOSE WHO IN TROUBLE AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS WE HAVE JUST GOT TO DO A BETTER JOB AND THIS IS TRULY. NOT A GOOD REFLECTION ON CALIFORNIA OR EVEN ON THIS NATION. IT IS SET. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING APPRECIATE IT HAVE A GOOD DAY THIS MEETING IS THE CHAIR.
