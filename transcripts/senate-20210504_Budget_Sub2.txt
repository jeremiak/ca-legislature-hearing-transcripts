A. 002% AND THEN WE WILL HEAR FROM. OUR GOOD FRIENDS IN THE MINISTRATIONS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD SECRETARY ROSS AND DIRECTOR BELCHING ME. KATE ALEJO. I'M GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE. THANK MINUTES WITH THE LATEST ANALYST- OFFICE IS BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE AND CAN STAFF TO PRESENT THIS AGRICULTURE A BUDGET PLAN- WITH AGRICULTURE BUT PLAN IS. OF SEVERAL. ARTICLE TO FOR HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUND- THIS IS MADE UP OF A EIGHTYMILLION DOLLARS FOR A GRANT PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE ALTERNATIVES. CULTURAL BURNING IN ORDER REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION FOR THE FORMER PROGRAM WHICH IS A GRANT PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES FUNDING TO REPLACE AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT. IN ORDER TO REDUCE SOME POLLUTION. NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT SPENDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TRANSITION TO SAFER SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL. FUNDING WOULD GO TO DPR FOR ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT OTHER PROGRAMS. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT GRANT PROGRAMS WITHIN DPR AND CFA. I WILL PROVIDE MY NEEDS- COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. FIFTY MILLION FOR THE ALTERNATIVE ANYWHERE MESSAGE THAT ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IMPLEMENTS NON DIGESTER PRACTICES TO REDUCE AND AVOID METHANE EMISSIONS. AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR CDFA TO CREATE A DNA BARCODES BARCODE REFERENCE LIBRARY FOR CALIFORNIA AND SEX. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ONE SURE THERE'LL BE SOME QUESTIONS LATER ON BUT WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION MY COLLEAGUES- TALKING IN THE HALL RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T WANT WE JUSTTURNED TO- SECRETARY- BLOOMIN HAS A- HAS IT'S BEEN. ALL OVER THIS CULTURAL PRACTICE- THE PROPOSAL GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING JERRY HOUSE THE YOU DOING. I'M IN THE GREEK LOTUS THEY SAY. IT. THIS IS A RECORD THAT MANY HERE BLUE I'M SECRETARY KELLY- AND SHARE AYE AYE BE SO MAIN ON THE **** MIL INCREASE THAT ASPEN OF THE PROPOSED I'M ALSO TRUMP AT THAT THANK BANG OUT. WELCOME I'M ALSO HAPPY TO THOSE BUT I'M PRIMARILY GET FOCUS. THE MIDDLE. I'M AND JUST GIVE KIND OF A I WILL EVEN THAT HAPPENS. TO GO TO QUESTIONS AND WE LOOK HAVE- AS THE MEN. A COMPLICATED WAY ARE SIMPLE WAY OF SAYING SOMETHING COMPLICATED WHICH IS THAT IT'S BASICALLY THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. AND IT'S COLLECTED IS A FLAT RATE ON- HAVE POUNDS OF PESTICIDE SOLD IRRESPECTIVE OF THE POTENTIAL HEALTH OR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PESTICIDES AND- YOU KNOW IT IN DOING THIS JOB FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND BEFORE THAT WORKING WITH WHICH THOMAS- IT'S CLEAR THAT EVERY SINGLE PASS AND CHAT. AND COMMITTEE WANTS TO MOVE AWAY TO LESS TOXIC PESTICIDES IF YOU TALK TO FARMWORKERS OLE- FAMILIES THEY EAT FOOD ALL SUPERMARKETS THAT SELL FOOD- THE FARMERS THEMSELVES. I'M SO WE THIS THIS IS REALLY PART OF AN INTEGRATED PLAN TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARDS LESS TOXIC PESTICIDES ISN'T THE SOLE WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT'S PART OF THAT TRANSITION. SO AT THE MOMENT WITH SENDING A PRETTY CLEAR SIGNAL- THAT'LL PESTICIDES ARE EQUAL BY TEARING IT NAMELY THE MORE TOXIC PESTICIDE THE HIGHER THE FEES WILL BE ASSESSED FOR SENDING A CLEAR MARKET SIGNAL. TO EVERYONE TO MOVE TOWARDS LESS TOXIC MATERIALS- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A AND NECESSARY IN INNOVATIVE CHANGES SUPPORTS. THIS TRANCE TRANSFORMATION AS I DESCRIBED IT SAYS. ONE ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP FARMERS AND I WAS RECENTLY- IN FRESNO TALKING TO FARMERS WAS. THAT THEIR ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S OFTEN A WILLINGNESS CHAD TO DO IT BUT NOT THE TOOLS TO HELP. FARMERS WHO INCREDIBLY BUSY I'M DOING A WHOLE SET OF THINGS I UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE THAT CHANGE SO THE KID MAILED BOTH ENCOURAGES THE USE OF LAST TEXT TOXIC PESTICIDES BUT ALSO MOST IMPORTANTLY. AND THIS IS KIND OF I THINK A KEY ISSUE THAT'S COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN OUR DISCUSSIONS PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL. WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIND THE BUDGET DEFICIT- THAT EXISTS WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION WHICH IS BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE'RE SAYING IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS CHANGE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT AND FARMERS AND IN THE FUTURE. OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SEVEN THE PROPOSAL TODAY WHICH- COMES OUT A TOTAL OF. ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. REAL SPEND MOST OF THE MONEY ON WORKING WITH PHAM AS WELL WITH ACCENTURE THAT USE IN OTHER TO DO WHAT'S CALLED INTEGRATE PEST. IT'S AT. HOW HOW DO THINK OF THIS IS DID BUT HAD WE PROVIDE THOSE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FARMERS WILL ALSO LOOKING AT STRONGER ENFORCEMENT. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TO PRODUCE BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES- WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THROUGH THE AB SIX ONE SEVEN PROCESS REALIZING THAT COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE ADJACENT. TO FIELDS THAT ARE STRAIGHT- HAVE A VERY STRONG CONCERN ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IMPACTS OF THAT SPRING AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TWO THINGS WE HAVE. ENFORCEMENT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS WE HAVE NOTIFICATION SO. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY'RE BEING SPRAYED. ALL THE FIELDS ADJACENT TO THEM BEING SPRAYED AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EXACT ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES ARE. SO IN SUMMARY- WE REALLY WANT TO. DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO SPEED UP THE DEVELOPMENT AND MOVEMENT TOWARDS EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES THAT'S WHERE. THIS HAS TO HAPPEN- WE NEED TO SPEED THAT RESEARCH PROCESS OUT SO THAT WE CAN- ALSO SPEED UP DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. SO THAT THE HEAD LESS TOXIC PESTICIDES ALL THE ALTERNATIVES THE. QUICKER THEY GO ON TO THE MARKET. SO JUST FOR CONTEXT WE'VE BEEN USED THESE INTEGRATE PEST MANAGEMENT. PRACTICE TODAY- IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE ISLAMIC PROGRAMS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM- FROM HIS ZERO TAYWAN TRACTORS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE PAUL PATTON IN PRACTICE THE PEOPLE ARE DOING IT WE JUST WANT TO. DO THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF PESTICIDES MOVE THOSE TO HAPPEN QUICKER. SO WE- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT- WE NEED THE FUNDING TO HELP MAKE- THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- REMOVES AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF NOT RAISING THIS FEE- WE WANT TO EXPAND AND MONITORING THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL ELEMENT THAT HAPPENS IN THIS PLANCHETTE. IS WE TRIED TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT WHEN MEASURING THE TOXIC AND CRITERIA. I AND CONTAMINANTS BUT WOULD NOT MEASURING PESTICIDES INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH THE END RESULT IS BALD WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SET UP PILOTS. WE NEED TO EXPAND THAT NOW. I'M WE CONTINUE TO WORK AND BUILD ENGAGEMENT THROUGH THE STATE- MEETING WITH BOTH PESTICIDE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. AND MEETING WITH TOM GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HEARING THAT ISSUES INVOLVED ONE OF THE PROPOSALS- THAT WE'VE HAD IS WELL JUST LET'S JUST FIND THE P. OPPORTUNITY IS. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL SPECIALLY WITH BOTH INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING THE ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SAD THAT WE HAVE. A LONG TERM FUNDING TRAJECTORY WHAT WE'RE HEARING AGAIN AND AGAIN IS DOWN. YEAH WE LOCK TWO YEARS OF FUNDING BUT REALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE STUDY INTEGRATED. PEST MANAGEMENT FUNDING THAT GOES ON- DAY IN DAY OUT AND SOME PREDICTABILITY WHICH THE MAIL PROVIDES SAID IN CLOSING I'M AGRICULTURE IS A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY. THIS PROPOSAL IS AN INVESTMENT AND ITS FUTURE AND CALIFORNIA'S AND WITH A CHANGING CLIMATE WHICH WILL LIKELY. BRING NEW AND DIFFERENT PEST PRESSURES IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE MAKE THIS. NOW TO IN HEALTH POLLINATOR HEALTH. THE SOIL AIR AND WATER- WHICH'LL FOUND TO STATE AGRA. SECTOR AND WITH THE I'LL CLOSE AND I'M TEN BACK TO YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT I'M- THIS IS. THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT BRINGS MANY MANY GROUPS TOGETHER- I'M I HOPE E'LL GET TO BE ABLE TO REACH RESERVE RESOLUTION ON IT THIS. SESSION THANK YOU YEAH AND THEN S. FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT THE- THE BUDGET PLAN ON AS OUTLINED ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE IT SHOULD UNDER THE HEADING OF TRANSITION TO A SAFER SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT. IT SHOULD BE A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM OF FORTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY NOT IT SAYS IT SAYS FORTY SO WE'LL HAVE THAT. I SECRETARY BLOOMFIELD AT THE- THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL YOU KNOW IF IT AGAIN WE- EACH MALES WORTH THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION THREE POINT NINE MILLION AS FAR AS YOU GO OUT INTO THE DISTANCE BUT YOU WERE THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE US THE SENATE AGRICULTURE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS TALKING ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MILLS TO SUPPORT COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. AND IN ANOTHER YOU KNOW MILFORD TO ENHANCE YOUR BEDSIDE MONITORING THERE'S A THIRD OF A MILL FOR THE- AB- SIX ONE SEVEN BUT IT DIDN'T ONLY TWO BILLS FOR THE FIVE FIVE PM PROGRAM AND THEN ANOTHER MALE FOR THE EDUCATION OF- FIVE PM. AND THEN BUT A MILL THERE INTO MILLS BASICALLY FOR- THE RESEARCH AT- C. ISSUE IN AT- THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU TELL ME SOME IDEA OF HOW YOU THINK THAT THE COUNTY ACT COMMISSIONERS AND A TWO AND A HALF MILL SAID THEY WOULD BE GETTING. AND ALSO THE- THE OUTRAGE WITH THE CAL THE HEALTH SYSTEM MERCY ISSUE SYSTEM OF THOSE WORK TOGETHER AND WHAT CAN WHAT CAN THE FARMERS ON THE- ON THE GROUND EXPECT TO COME FROM THIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. TO THOSE COUNTY FOLKS. YEAH I'M I'M HAPPY TO GET INTO THAT AND ALSO SECRETARY ROSS- AND DIRECTOR DOES SEEM TO CONTROL CAN ALSO BOASTED IT. JUST SEVEN PEOPLE% I'M LISTENING ON. CONFUSED BECAUSE IT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS LIKE WHEN WE SET TO MAIL IT'S NOT TWO MILLION IT'S THE MIDDLE FEE WHICH IS. THE NEW MALCHOW PAD- PESTICIDE SOLD- SO IN THIS PLAN JUST BROADLY BECAUSE THIS DOES THE FOLKS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WILL MAINLY BE USED THE EXTENSION AND OTHER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY THEY'VE BEEN DOING IS A SECRETARY RUSSELL WILL ATTEST. AN INCREDIBLE JOB FOUR YEARS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO- TO FAMAS BUT THAT MONEY HAS BEEN VERY INTO INTIMATE AND- WE ARE KNOWN AROUND THE COUNTRY AS AS HAVING ONE OF THE BEST IBM PROGRAMS BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY FUNDED IBM PROGRAM- AND SO WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THEY WOULD WHAT WITH THE I. COMMISSION AS BUT OFTEN SEPARATELY- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BASED ON THE TYPE OF CROSS BASED ON THE- TYPE OF PASSED. THE LOOK AT HOLISTIC SOLUTIONS AND REPLICATE THOSE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE WORKED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE OR COUNTRY OR EVEN THE WILD THE ACTIVATION IS HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC REGULATORY ROLE UNDER FEDERAL PESTICIDE REGULATIONS- THEY'RE ACTUALLY THE DELEGATION GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE AG COMMISSIONERS THOSE AT COMMISSION IS KIND OF HAVE A DUAL ROLE ONE IS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE APPOINTED BY THE LOCAL. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BUT THEY ALSO RECALLED BACK OUT TO- BOTH HAD SECRETARY ROSS AND DIRECTED ALL CD- IN THE CONTEXT OF PESTICIDES THE ADVANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ISN'T PESTICIDE DRIFT DRIFT IS A TIME WHICH MEANS PESTICIDE IS GOING AND BEING SPRAYED FONG ON NON TARGET- ENTITIES WHICH COULD BE AND HAS IN THE PAST UNFORTUNATELY BEEN FARMWORKERS THEMSELVES HAS BEEN SCHOOLS- HAVE BEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NON TARGETED MAKING SURE THAT ENFORCEMENT HAPPENS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT BECAUSE WE OWN THAT FEDERAL DELEGATION- THAT WE'RE ENGAGING SETTING CLEAR PERFORMANCE METRICS CLEAR- ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES ALL WHAT NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED SO THAT COMMUNITIES CAN FEEL SAFE AT THE MOMENT. WHEN WE TOLD HIM WE NEEDED THESE AS ASSEMBLY. SOME OF EVER. DATA FOR IN ABOUT INCELS. WE ONLY GET AOUT TO FACT- HOW WILL WORKING. AND IT NEEDS TO TRAINED AND FUNDING HELP THAT THE THAT COMMISSION. CHAD WHO- I DO. WAY TOO MUCH WAY TOO LITTLE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORKLOAD IS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE PUT ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE PROJECT TO HELP THEM- SO WE CAN- BALLOT OLE. OLE OLE SECRETARY ROSS CAN TALK THROUGH THE BUDGET FILM IN MORE DETAIL AS CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT BASICALLY THE GOAL IS. IS TO PROVIDE CONSISTENT LONG TERM FUNDING TO ALLOW THE SYSTEM- TO WHACK IN A WAY THAT- THAT THE AND COMMISSION IS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF FUNDING WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF. ACCOUNTABILITY AND ASSURANCES. THE PUBLIC HAS- IN THIS PROPOSAL THE ABILITY THE FUNDING TO HELP THEM ENGAGE BECAUSE OFTEN. THERE THERE'S NO WAY OF A BUILDING THAT LOCALS COMMUNITY SUPPORT. TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES- AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT MONITORING TO SHOW. THAT THE PESTICIDES- STAYING WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO- AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. OKAY I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT OTHER. MATTERS ON THE TIER YEAH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CRITICS THAT BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THE MOST TOXIC PESTICIDES FARMERS REALLY DON'T WANT TO USE THAT AND ONLY USE IT SPARINGLY. IN THE MIDDLE MALLETS AND. THEN BY PUTTING A HIGHER. MILL FEED ON THAT. YOU WERE- IT COMPROMISED THEIR BILL TO RAISE THEIR CRY- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AND WE WILL HEAR FROM THOSE CRITICS BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY JUST. GENERALLY ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE MELFI. THANK YOUR QUESTION CHAD YES SAID THAT THE BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF THE MILTIE IT IS MUCH LIKE HOW THE- DEVICES THE USE FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE TO A HIGHER FEE ON THE MOST POLLUTING- SUBSTANCES- AND THEN THE NOTE IN THE CASE OF THIS. WAS SAYING JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED THAT THE MORE TOXIC THE COMPONENT AND THIS IS IN US DECIDING IT- WE'RE BASICALLY LOOKING AT THE LABEL. AND US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY COMES OUT WITH AS LABEL- AND WE DIVIDED THAT INTO THREE SAID THE LEAST HARMFUL WE'RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE BY HAVING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FEE- AND- THE MOST WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST FEES AT THE MOST TOXIC FOR THE- DETAILS UPSET. VERY BASIC APPLICATION OF THE FOOD- PAGE PRINCIPLE WITH TRYING TO USE FINANCIAL MECHANISMS AND INCENTIVES TO SAY HELLO ON THE SHELF HERE- YOU SHOULD SEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY COSTING LESS. I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL TO SAY SOMETHING THAT'S OFTEN NOT. UNDERSTOOD ABOUT PESTICIDES SALES IN THE STATE HAAF OF THEM I'M SURE WHITE HOUSE YOU HAPPEN IN THE OPEN AREA SO HOT FOR THE MAIL IS GENERATED THROUGH ELEVEN SALES THAT BLEACH THAT'S MOSTLY THINGS UNDER YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER- SO THE WAY WE'RE GONNA MAIN HERE FROM AGRICULTURE TODAY THEY PAY HIGH OFF OF THAT SHE- SAID IN THIS SCHEME. OF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION- DAY WOULD PAY HOSTAGE TWO AND A HALF MILLION THE REST JUST TO GIVE YOU A CLEAR EXAMPLE- AND THERE'S A LOT OF CALIFORNIA BRANDS THAT SELL THESE BUT A NON TOXIC WINDOW CLEANER. WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A BLEACH ALTERNATIVE AND WHEN YOU SEE IT ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF YOU- AT A SUPERMARKET YOU WHICH DAY- THIS ONE'S BOTH LESS EXPENSIVE. AND BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT PLAYS OUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE- PANOPLY. PESTICIDES SOLD AND. YET HAS A SITE INCLUDE. EACH IS OLD OF THIS. BECAUSE THAT WILL READ. BY US IN THE TRI GOVERNMENT AS SO IT'S SEND THE MARKET SIGNAL THAT CLEAR- JUST AS WE WOULD WITHIN. VEHICLE IF YOU IT'S SIX. THAN A D. CAR. I AS THAT ONE IF YOU SEE IT'S LESS IT'S- TO. A A LESS TOXIC PESTICIDE OUR GOAL IS TO MOVE THE MARKET IN THAT DIRECTION PROGRESSIVELY. ONCE AGAIN A FINE EXAMPLE OF THAT URBAN RURAL PARTNERSHIP HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LET'S NOT TURN TO SECRETARY ROSS IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST WITH THE OFFICE OF PESTICIDE- MISTER. BOSSINEY SECRETARY ROSS HEY MISTER CHAIRMAN MORNING AND THANK YOU- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- SHARE IT SHOWS GREAT PROFICIENCY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT VERY COMPLEX AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM- SO I DON'T WANT TO BE REPETITIVE BUT I DO WHEN I CALL IN TWO THINGS ONE IS THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS- IT IS UNIQUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK HAVING THAT VOCAL ARM OF A REGULATORY AGENCY HAS BEEN A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SUCCESS OF AGRICULTURE DURING THE CONTINUAL ADAPTATION THAT IT'S DONE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO NEW REGULATORY PROGRAMS. THEY OFTEN TIMES ARE THE SPONSORS AND SPRAY SAFE AND OTHER- FIBER TO THE TEETH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REGULATED COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE NEW REGULATIONS ARE BUT THE CHANGES ARE AND HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE THAT SO THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERS PRESS AND I JUST WANTED TO CALL OUT THE ROLE BECAUSE. IT IS UNIQUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SECONDLY WE HAVE LOST OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES IN PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC TO. THE AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES DIVISION. WHICH IS OVERSEAS COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. AND THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE HELD ON CAMPUSES. WITH SPECIALIST WE DO THE RESEARCH TO CREATE THE CONTENT IN THE KNOWLEDGE. AND GIVE US WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD OUT PROGRAMS BUT WHAT MAKES BUT COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SYSTEM. SUCH A VALUE PROPOSITION IS THE TRANSLATION OF THOSE RESEARCH FINDINGS. TO THE END USER AND A VERY PRACTICAL WAY IN THEIR REGION AND THEIR CROPS. THEY OFTENTIMES ARE DOING FIELD TRIALS TO BE ABLE TO SHOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE. AND BEING ABLE TO INVEST THE MAP. ON A ON A CONTINUAL BASIS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE- IT'S LOST THAT SPENDING BY PM PROGRAM HAS LOST SIGNIFICANT FUNDING OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS- WE ALSO LAS SPENDING FOR THE FILE. DEBATED FARMING SYSTEMS WHICH IS A SMALL GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE RUN. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE IN BASIC PASSED PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. WE OFTEN TIMES WHEN THERE'S A NEW CAST WE ARE DEVELOPING THE CUTTING EDGE IPM APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THOSE INFESTATIONS. AND WE CONSTANTLY ARE LOOKING TO OUR PARTNERS AT UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. THE ROLE OF CSU IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE EDUCATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEST CONTROL ADVISORS AND PAST MANAGERS WITHIN FARMING OPERATIONS. SO BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM A STEADY STREAM OF FUNDING. THAT THEY CAN USE TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT BOOTS ON THE GROUND WITH PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO DO THE RESEARCH ON CAMPUS. WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE THIS A VERY ROBUST PROGRAM AND TRULY ASSIST. IN SUPPORTING THE TRANSITION OF AGRICULTURE TO MEET THE MULTIPLE. DEMANDS FROM THE MARKET PLACE AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY. THAT WE HAVE WITH. AND I YOUR- TO MAKE THIS COMMENTS SECTOR COULD YOU. ENLIGHTEN ME ON THE DNA BARCODE REFERENCE THE LIBRARY OF CALIFORNIA ONCE THIS IS ONCE THIS REFERENCE LIGHT BEER BREWERY IS COMPLETELY BUILT OUT HOW MIGHT IT HELP US IN THE FUTURE LEADERS. YEAH SO IT'S A VERY EXCITING- POSTAL I WAS THRILLED TO SEE MY FRIENDS- WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND IT REMINDED ME OF WHAT WE'VE WORKED ON SO HARD OVER THE YEARS TO DO SEEK BANKING. ALL WITH OUR NEW DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS AND THE NEW ABILITY TO SEQUENCE FACT THAT GENETICS- THIS WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IN OUR ECOSYSTEMS HOW IT'S MOVING AND I BELIEVE IT CAN HELP US- IDENTIFIED BASIC PASSED EARLIER BUT ALSO TRACK- HOW ARE POLLINATORS ARE MOVING AND WHERE THEIR DECLINES ARE AS WE REALLY WORK AND NEW PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY ON POLLINATOR HEALTH. IT WILL INFORM OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE DO EXTENSIVE TRAPPING AND LOOK FOR ALL KINDS OF TOOLS TO EXCLUDE AND BASIC PASSED WITH SECRETARY BLUMENFELD IS EXACTLY RIGHT WE ARE SEEING NEW INVASIVE PASSED WE'RE SEEING THEM HERE FOR LONGER- SEASONS- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE MERITS OF THIS WILL INFORM OUR PROGRAMS. GIVE ME A VERY PRACTICAL WAY. AND WHAT IS THE IMPROVE AS UNDERSTAND IT WILL ALSO MADE. THIS BRIDGE. OF GENETIC. MATERIAL AVAILABLE FOR ACADEMIA AND FOR FARMERS AND RANCHERS- WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST ENTOMOLOGIST I'M NOT ONLY IN THE NATION BUT WE HAVE SOME WORLD RENOWNED EXPERTS AT OUR AT OUR PLANT DIAGNOSTICS LAB. AND WE SEE THIS AS BEING A VERY HELPFUL TOOL FOR OUR WORK AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO CONTINUED RESEARCH AND PROTECTION OF OUR POLLINATORS AND BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT. YES SECRETARY ROSS GIVEN THAT RICH URBAN RURAL- HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA DO YOU SEE THAT AT SOME TIME THAT EVEN URBAN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH SIZE SPECIES POLLINATE WHICH PLAN IN WHICH EATS WHAT PASSED THAT THERE MAY BE. SOME COMMUNICATIONS TO SUBURBIA UP AT THIS IS THE TYPE OF. DO YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR BACKYARD BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO ATTRACT THIS PAST WHICH COULD EAT THIS BAD INVASIVE SPECIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I MEAN IS THAT WE END UP WITH THIS YEAH DEFINITELY BECAUSE- THERE ARE THERE ARE ENTITIES- DATABASES. THAT ARE HOUSED AT SEVERAL OF OUR UNIVERSITY AND ACADEMIA PARTNERS- I WILL CALL OUT IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF COOPERATIVE EXTENSION WHICH HAS. A PERSONNEL IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AN EXTENSIVE- MAKEUP OF CITIZEN SCIENTISTS AND MASTER GARDENERS WHO WORK SPECIFICALLY ON THESE KINDS OF THINGS SO THAT THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ARM THEM WITH THAT INFORMATION. AND TEACHING- THE RIGHT PLANTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND HOW TO DO- THE LOWEST IMPACT PEST MANAGEMENT POSSIBLE THIS IS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED- THROUGH THAT SYSTEM OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE DOING COMMUNITY OUTREACH- TO GARDENERS TO GOLF COURSES- AND TO BERMAN LANDSCAPERS A VERY IMPORTANT AUDIENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. WHILE THERE MUST BE SOME PEOPLE IN SUBURBIA THAT REALIZE THAT OUR AS OUR STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT A 99% DECLINE IN MONARCH BUTTERFLIES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY IN LAST FORTY YEARS AND IF THEY KNEW. WHAT TYPE OF PLANT THEY SHOULD PUT IN IT WHEN THEY GO TO HOME DEPOT WHEREVER THEY GO THAT PLANTS PLANTS. UP THERE MIGHT BE GOOD INFORMATION. E. GOOD LET'S. GET TO. THE S. MANAGEMENT WE HAVE DIRECTOR OF BELT ALL STEAMY WHICH IS THE DAHLE SINI WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF PRESS REGULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR GENERAL MICHAEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S TIERED MIL PROPOSAL TODAY AND FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE CENTRIST IN THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF REALLY GOOD MEETINGS WITH LEGISLATORS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WITH OTHERS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. WE MET WITH NOW. NEARLY THIRTY LEGISLATORS AND WE WERE HERE BEFORE SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES. BUT IMPORTANTLY WE'VE ALSO REACHED OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE REALLY FROM THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE- PROPOSAL TO THOSE THAT HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WE REALLY KEPT AN OPEN DOOR IN THE OPEN MIND WHEN IT COMES TO. OF THE WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE THAT TRANSITION TO. SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PASSED. I WOULD OFFER SIMPLY A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS TO HELP OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY. THE FIRST IS THAT A MILL IS ONE TENTH OF ONE PENNY. SO IT'S A PRETTY SMALL AMOUNT- AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR SECRETARY BLUMENFELD SAID. REALLY THE PRIMARY. OPERATING FUND FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD ABOUT THE ALCHEMIST AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SECRETARIES ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AYE COMMISSIONERS. IT REALLY ARE ARE ESSENTIAL PARTNERS IN THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OF THEIR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED OR SO PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT STAFF AN ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGIST. THAT WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH. DPR AND CDFA TO ENSURE THAT. PESTICIDE USE LAWS ARE BEING ENFORCED APPROPRIATELY THAT PESTICIDE ILLNESSES ARE BEING INVESTIGATED PROBABLY. THE TRAINING SESSIONS FOR PESTICIDE USERS HAPPEN ON A REGULAR BASIS- THAT SAMPLING PRODUCE FOR ILLEGAL PESTICIDE RESIDUE AMONG MANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES. SO WE FEEL LIKE THAT INVESTMENT INTO IMPROVED COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT IS GOING TO BE REALLY. ESSENTIAL GOING FORWARD AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST ADD SHERMAN BY CAL SKI THAT. THIS ONE EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING BUT WE'RE REALLY MOVING ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION. ON WAYS TO EFFECT THIS TRANSITION TO SAFER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PASSED. OUT WHEN WE TOOK ACTION ON FOR PURIFIES. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. MONEY WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVES. AROUND QUARTER OF AUSTIN THAT IS A CENTRAL PART OF THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL REALLY. LOOKING AT BOTH CDFA MTPR PROGRAMS TO FIND THAT ALL IMPORTANT RESEARCH. AND THEN WE'RE ALSO WAS IN THE MIDST OF THE KICKING OFF THE WORK OF A SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT WORK GROUP WHICH IS GOING TO LOOK AT WAYS TO OFFER CALIFORNIANS A ROAD MAP FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PESTS. WHETHER IT'S IN THE BACK FORTY OR THE BACKYARD OR A PUBLIC PARK WERE IN OPEN SPACE OR- JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE YOU CAN IMAGINE AND WE'VE REALLY COLLECTED A GOOD. DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF CALIFORNIANS FROM ACADEMICS TO PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES TO. CHEMICAL COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES FARMERS AND OTHERS WHO WILL HELP GUIDE THE WORK OF THAT WORK GROUP OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S INCLUDED NETWORK GROUP ISN'T URBAN COMPONENTS AS WELL SO AS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD POINTED OUT. IN A PEST MANAGEMENT EXISTS IN THE URBAN SPACE AS WELL SO. WE REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GREAT PROPOSAL THAT MOVES THE STATE TOWARD SOME. OF THAT CONTINUED TRANSITION TO SAFER MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PASSED. INTO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT FARMERS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING I PM SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND- YOU ONLY NEED LOOK AT OF THE ALMOND INDUSTRY AND FOLKS. IN THE CITRUS INDUSTRY STRAWBERRIES. YES GREAT EXAM OF TRUE I CAN'T WE- THIS WILL. DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS REALLY MAKES THAT WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD AS A STATE. AND SO I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING ON THE PROPOSAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO. ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE YEAH I WANTED TO JUMP IN ON THE AIR MONITORING NETWORK THE PESTICIDE CARE MINING NETWORK BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS. LOTS OF POLLUTION PROBLEM FAMILY I'VE I'M ALWAYS FIGHTING ABOUT REDUCING CARBON VERSUS SOME CLEANING UP THERE THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE POLLUTION PROBLEMS CAN YOU. EXPLAIN HOW THE- YOU KNOW. I DON'T THINK THE FARMERS OF THE PEOPLE BY BLEACH ONE OF. FOR THE WHOLE HI THERE POLLUTION PROBLEM THE CENTRAL VALLEY TELL ME HOW YOU TARGET JUST THE PESTICIDE MONITORING UNDER THIS PROGRAM SO PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO PAY THE FEES WERE GOING TO BE MONITORING AND IMPROVING THEIR QUALITY THAT THE PESTICIDES. DIMINISHES SURE YOU KNOW THE PESTICIDES CARE MONITORING NETWORK THAT EXISTS TODAY CONSISTS AT DPR OF THREE PERMANENT LOCATIONS. OF THOSE CARDS SITES GENERATE INFORMATION AND DATA TO IDENTIFY IMPACTS AND TO. INFORM AND BETTER GUIDE OUR REGULATORY EFFORTS HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. WHAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD LIKE TO DO IS ADD ANOTHER FIVE AIR MONITORING SITES TO THAT. WE HAVE HAD OVER THE YEARS- CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AIRPORT TO. USE ANOTHER FIVE SITES AND HAVE WORKED WELL WITH THOSE SITES BUT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THEM PERMANENT NOW. AND NOT ALLOWED YEAR MONITORING WORK THAT WE DO HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO- SUFFERED THROUGH THE VICISSITUDES OF THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT. PARTICULARLY AS YOU POINT OUT SHERMAN MAKOWSKI OF FOR PESTICIDE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN THE VALLEY. BUT WE ALSO DO IMPORTANT THEY'RE MONITORING WORK FOR EXAMPLE IN VENTURA COUNTY AND IN THE SALINAS VALLEY AND I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE WITH COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS WHERE OTHER AIR MONITORING SITES MIGHT BE LOCATED IN THE FUTURE. TO ENSURE THAT. WE'RE DEVELOPING THE MOST ROBUST. HOW TO SET THAT WE- AND TO THEM TEND INFO. REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE IF WE FIND FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEIR- EXCESSIVE EXIGENCES A PARTICULAR FUMIGANTS OR OTHER PESTICIDES IN. DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. SO I MEAN I ASSUME YOU KNOW WE'RE SPENDING A BUNCH OF DATA ON AIR MONITORING. EQUIPMENT IN. THE CAP AND TRADE I'M NOT THAT'S NEXT WEEK HEALTH I'LL BE MAD NEXT WEEK BUT- YOU GET THAT THAT IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WE'RE EXPANDING THIS. YEAR MONITORING THESE FIVE LOCATIONS BUT THE ACTUAL DATA THAT COMES IN. THERE IS HE IS IT EASY TO SEPARATE- THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDES THIS IS THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR QUALITY BOARD THIS IS FROM. POLLUTING TRUCKS DIESEL TRUCKS I MEAN IT IS THAT SOME OF THE CHEMICALS THAT SHOW UP COULD ONLY BE FROM THE PESTICIDES RIGHT AYE AYE OR TO MATCH AND- RIGHT AND SO THE- BEST. MY THAT WE DO FOCUSES ON. THIRTY ONE SPECIFIC PESTICIDES AND THEN FIGHT DEBT RIDDANCE SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THIRTY SIX. PESTICIDE SPECIFIC. THE DATA POINTS SECRETARY BLUMENFELD I'M JUST GONNA USE IT AND ALLOW SAID- GERUND AND SAY THAT THE WHAT WHEN YOU GUYS SEE ONE OF THESE- AND MONITORING FACILITIES THAT THAT DOES PESTICIDE IT IS BASICALLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND SENSORS- AND SO IT'S VERY VERY NARROWLY SPECIES EIGHT EIGHT TO THE SPECIFIC. REYES THIRTY ONE PESTICIDES THAT BOWS MENTIONING YOU COUNTING IT OUT THROUGH A NORMAL PM TWO POINT FIVE ALL OF THAT ARE THAT AND MONITORING THAT LOOKS UPSET OR- OR DUST YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT LEVEL OF DATA THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT I'D SAY IS THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROCESS SO AS WE DURING COMMUNITY MEETINGS. TO UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUES AND CONCERNS THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM COMMUNITY GROUPS IN AGRICULTURAL REGIONS THE BALLAST POINT ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. OKAY AND I KNOW THAT THE MANY ARE LAW TO THE- KNOW THAT INTEGRATE. MANAGEMENT DOES LIVE. PESTICIDES JUST REDO THEM SO ON THIS WE'RE GONNA IT- PUMP UP THE GRANT PROGRAM IN THE OUT REACH PROGRAM. IS THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ALREADY. BELIEVE IT I GUESS IS A FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM THEY'RE THEY'RE USING AN INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK IS GONNA HAPPEN OF ASSUMING THIS COMES UP. HOWEVER WE ARE PEOPLE GONNA GET THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN WAITING EVENT TONIGHT WHERE YOU GONNA GET OTHER- BRAK ARE YOU GET IT HOPE TO CHANGE THE PRACTICES OF SOME. LATE ADOPTERS RIGHT THE% EARLY ADOPTERS ARE ALREADY YEAH I GET THAT RIGHT AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY SO THEY CAN GET THAT MONEY BACK TELL ME HOW YOU SEE THE GRANT PROGRAMS IN THE- REGION IMPLEMENTATION WORKING. WELL SPEAKING FOR THE DPR GRANT PROGRAMS AND- I'LL LET SECRETARY ROSS SPEAK TO. SEE HERE AS GRANT PROGRAMS. AREN'T RICH PROGRAMS FOR RESEARCH INTO ALTERNATIVES ARE OFTEN IF NOT ALWAYS OVER SUBSCRIBED SO I THINK THAT WITH THIS INVESTMENT. FROM THIS YEAR NO PROPOSAL WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT ACADEMICS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE. COME TO THE DEPARTMENT ON FOR VARIOUS. RESEARCH INTO THE BIO PESTICIDES AND BIO CONTROLS OR OTHERWISE TOXIC WAYS OF. MANAGING PASSED IN THE AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY IN EUROPE AND FIRE. IN ADDITION SIR YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT INTO. THE NON GRANT IPM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE DPR WHICH INCLUDE ARE HEALTHY SCHOOLS. PROGRAM IN. AND VARIOUS OTHERS HE AT THE TO WE'VE CREATED INTEGRATED CUSTOMER BRANCH IN. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH REALLY HAS WORKED WITH. CHILD CARE CENTERS AND SCHOOLS AND OTHER SENSITIVE SITES AROUND THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT FROM TO ADMINISTER THE KINDS OF% PESTICIDES THAT YOU MAY FIND IN THE CLEANING CLOSET. ARE DOING SO IN A WAY THAT. DOESN'T IMPACT THE HEALTH OF STUDENTS OR OTHERS WHO WORK IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE APPLICATORS THEMSELVES. SO THEY'RE SORT OF A TWIN INVESTMENT INTO BOTH THE GRANT PROGRAMS AT DPR WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIAL HAVE YOU KNOW THE- REALLY IMPORTANT RESULTS. AS WELL AS THE IPM PROGRAMS. THAT WE HAVE HERE IN HOUSE. SECTOR RESCUE JUMP IN REAL QUICK I THE CITY OF. I WOULD LOVE TO OUR GRANT PROGRAMS ARE FAIRLY SMALL PROGRAMS THAT THEY'REVERY EFFECTIVE THEY DO IN SEVERAL THINGS ONE IS WITHIN A STATE THAT HAS FOUR HUNDRED CROSS MANY OF THEM ARE SO SPECIALIZED THAT IT'S HARD TO ATTRACT. A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO CREATE PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS FOR SOME OF THOSE CROPS THERE IS A REGIONAL APPROACH THAT'S FUNDED THROUGH THE FARM BILL CALLED I ARE FOR THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE WHAT WE CALL BURKE AND CROPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ALTERNATIVES. AND BEING ABLE TO PUT SOME STATE FUNDING OUT THERE WITH THAT KIND OF WORK IS A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVES TO THE MOST TOXIC PESTICIDES AS A WAY TO GET THAT SYSTEM GOING IN THAT DIRECTION THAT'S ONE WAY WE DO OURS. THE OTHER ONE IS IN IN RESTARTING THE BIOLOGICALLY INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM THIS IS ABOUT- A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER COULD BE A RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT IT COULD BE USED TO COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. THAT ORGANIZES GROUPS OF FARMERS- IN A REGION AROUND THE COMMODITY TO DO DEMONSTRATION OF HOW TO DO MORE SYSTEMS APPROACH TO NOT JUST LOOK AT THE PAST MANAGEMENT CASE BUT TO LOOK AT THE OVERALL SYSTEM INCLUDING SOIL HEALTH AND OTHER PRACTICES THAT WILL REDUCE THE PAST PRESSURE AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR INTERVENTION. AND THIS IS THE WAY WE'RE FOCUSING ON INCORPORATING ALTERNATIVES TO THE MOST TAXED TAXING PAKCIK PESTICIDES AND OUR THIRD ONE IS ON PROACTIVE I PM. WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE OUR MAPPING TOOLS TO SEE EMERGING PAST ISSUES AGAIN IT'S PARTNERING WITH THE RESEARCHER COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND A COMMODITY GROUP TO START TO TEST WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAYS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY SHOULD THAT HAPPEN AND THAT'S USUALLY AROUND BIOCONTROL WHICH IS FINDING A FRIENDLY PASSED. THAT WILL WILL DESTROY THE AND BASIC PASSED THOSE ARE. THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE USE OUR VERY SMALL PROGRAMS REALLY. BEST AS A WHOLE. I WOULD SAY PRO. THAT PAIR OF. THEMSELVES DOING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR OTHER FARMERS WITH COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ON FIELD TRIALS IS ONE OF OUR MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS AT GETTING THOSE PRACTICES OUT THERE AND REALLY GETTING ADAPTATION AT SCALE IN CALIFORNIA. EXCELLENT AND I KNOW SECRETARY BLUMENFELD I REALLY WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU ON THAT THE TIERED MIL FEE BUT DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ABOUT THE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. SIX WHICH IS SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS ON THE AGRICULTURAL BURNING AND WHAT THIS MAY MEAN UP PROPOSALS FOR THE AIR QUALITY IN THE- IN OUR AGRICULTURAL BASIS. WELL THEN YEAH THANK SEVENTY ROSS AND I. HAVE BEEN ACTING ON THIS ONE AS WELLWITH THAT EVERY SOURCES. BOARD- SAYS. RIGHT THIS I JUST VERY THE REALLY WANT TO COME AND- AGRICULTURAL IN THE VALLEY- THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IS AN ASH AND- IS IN SEVERE NON ATTAINMENT OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT STANDARDS CHáVEZ I WAS AND PARTICULAR MAD AT AND- IT'S PARTICULARLY STUBBORN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY. OF THE VALLEY- WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THAT YOU KNOW A IN IN WAYS TO THE TO THE LA BASIN BUT HAS A LOT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES SO. OVER THE LAST DECADES AGRICULTURE. VOLUNTARILY IS COME AND STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND SAID HOW DO WE HELP HOW TO EXPAND RESEARCH HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT ADOPTING NEW PRACTICES- THE FOLLOW PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW. POSSIBLY FUNDED THROUGH USDA WITH OTHER PROGRAMS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TRACTOR CONVERSION PROGRAMS PROBABLY IN THE WILD. AND THE FAMAS LOOKING EVERY DAY AT WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT. DIFFERENT FARMING PRACTICES THAT HELP REDUCE EMISSIONS SO I JUST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY FOR THAT. AND THEN SECONDLY SAY IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA AND THAT ANY- WHICH IS. A LONG AND COMPLEX ISSUE WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I'VE GOT TO A POINT WHERE DOES THE SCIENCE WAS IN THAT WE NEED TO SET AN END DATE FOR THAT- BUT WE REALLY CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT PROVIDING MEANINGFUL. I'M FUNDING TO ALLOW PRACTICES THAT EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO NEED TO HAPPEN IT JUST NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A CONTROLLED MANNER- ON THAT SONG SO THAT THE EMISSIONS DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION AND SO. THIS THIS IS- BEEN A AB EIGHT VERY- I THINK COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH THE AGRICULTURE- THEY DO NOT. ONE NECESSARILY IF YOU'RE THERE IN THE ROOM THEY WOULD BE LIKE WE LIVE LONGER BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE RESOURCES BOARD- HAS. EIGHT EIGHT DATE ON ENDING AND BANNING AND IN THAT. REMAINING THREE YEARS WE NEED TO WORK. TO GET THAT TO THE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS ISN'T. THAT IS REALLY PART OF - AND- HOWEVER. AROUND OUR OUR THAT. TO A LOT OF THE WOULD WILL BE DIFFICULT I'M AN EXAMPLE AND CHAD IS. THAT KAREN IS MOST FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE IS AN INDUSTRY THAT SHE REPRESENTED BUT IN THAT. IN THE TABLE GRAPE AND WINE INDUSTRY- THE HOMAGE- THAT'S BUILT OUT OF METAL AND HAS WIDELY GOES THROUGH THE VINES HARRY HOW YOU TAKE THAT Y. ALEX- SO THAT IT CAN PROBABLY BE. AND AND HOW YOU MANAGE THOSE MATERIALS THESE NEED TO ALSO BE TRANSFORMED AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF- ON THE VERY POSITIVE SIDE THAT RELATES TO REGENERATIVE. AG AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THIS IS A NEW TO BUY CHIPS STRINGS. SO THAT DOZEN NEED TO KNOW BE. IT CAN BE CHIPPED- AND- PUT BACK NTO THE SOIL I'M AS AN AMENDMENT- TO HELP THAT OIL HEALTH AND THAT COMMON IN THE SOIL BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FUNDING TO DO IT SAID THIS IS A- THANK. YOU PROBABLY WON'T FIND AN ISSUE THAT KAREN AND I FEEL MORE PASSIONATE ABOUT. HOW THE OTHER THAN IBM AND THIS ONE YET ANYTHING ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL. DETAILS ON IT AT THE END OF THE SEASON SECRETARY ROSS SAID TO COMPLEMENT WHAT I. WAS SAYING HOPEFULLY THANKS. ALL RIGHT LET'S. I'M SORRY SECRETARY. NO I WAS GOING TO CALL IN FARMERS AND HE'S REALLY GOOD. THANKS FOR THE ALL I DID WANT TO COME THAT THIS IS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE HAVE A PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE SMALL AND MID SIZED GROWERS ARE ABLE TO DO THIS- INSTEAD SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TAX. TO WORK WITH THEM BUT THE INDUSTRY HAS AS THEY ARE- THEY KNOW THAT THIS CAN WORK. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE MORE RECENT ONE OF A NEW PRACTICE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIND THROUGH OUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS UNDER HEALTHY SOILS. WHICH IS CALLED WHOLE ORCHARD RECYCLING WHICH IS A HUGE COOPERATIVE HUGE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT CAN COME OUT AND LITERALLY PULL OUT THE WHOLE TREE. AS WE KNOW. ALMOND ORCHARDS LAST POSSIBLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND THEN THEY ALL HAVE TO BE REPLACED- IN THIS PULLS THOSE TREES OUT AND THEN DOES THE CHIPPING RIGHT THERE IN THE FIELD. AND THEN REINCORPORATED INTO THIS ALSO WE CAN CONTINUE THAT CARBON SEQUESTRATION PRACTICE- THAT ONE IS A NEWER PROJECT FOR US AND IT IS NOW FUND IT'S ARE HEALTHY CELLS PROGRAMS. AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR THE ALMOND INDUSTRY BUT SMALL FARMERS WILL HAVE SMALLER AMOUNTS OF WOODY BIOMASS STAND. THERE WILL BE A NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET. THIS KIND OF EQUIPMENT AND THESE KINDS OF PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY- TO ACCOMMODATE THE DIVERSITY OF FARMERS THAT WE HAVE. EXCELLENT WELL LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE PANEL I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE VICE CHAIR DALIAN AND ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO LIKE TO. HAVE QUESTIONS OF OUR PANEL. OR THE- WITH A- BATTLE OFFICE. SENATE ALI THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR SO I'M I DIDN'T I WANTED. SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT ACT TALK ABOUT THE SO I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS IS A- THIS IS ISSUE BY DPR THIS IS ACTUALLY AND APPLICATORS PERMIT I BELIEVE I'M THE ONLY LEGISLATOR THAT. HOUSE ONE. I SHOW THIS IN EQ- WHICH IS ALLOWS ME TO USE. S. TRAINING ME TO USE. HERBICIDES PESTICIDES ON MY PHONE. AND I HAVE TO GO TO CONTINUING EDUCATION EVERY TWO YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY EMPLOYEES AND I'M DOING USING SAFE PRACTICES ON OUR FARM SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND IN THIS AREA AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. BARMY I'M A FARMER AND WE GET WE GET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO. THAT YOU KNOW. SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS ON FARMS. AND IT'S REALLY NOT. EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS ON FARMS ITS IT'S- MAYBE- THEY'VE BEEN EDUCATED IN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE GROUND AS MUCH AS MAYBE THE SECRETARY AND SOME OTHERS BUT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THE CHALLENGES OF BEING ON A FARM IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE ALL FIRST OF ALL NUMBER ONE I'M JUST FOR EXAMPLE I'M DOING SOME ORGANIC FARMING I JUST STARTED THE PAPERWORK LAST YEAR TO FOR THIS LAST WEEK TO- START DOING ORGANIC FARMING BUT I DO NEED THE TOOLS OF HERBICIDES I DON'T USE ANY PESTICIDES THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE ANY BUG PROBLEMS- SO FAR I HAVEN'T HAD THOSE- BUT IN MY DISTRICT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT. 95% OF THE- STRAWBERRY PLANTS NOT TO BURY% ITSELF BUT THE PLANT THE NURSERIES ARE IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY GROW THE PLANT SO THAT IN WATSONVILLE THEY CAN. GROW THE VERY. FOREIGN BORN MEXICO OR SOMEPLACE ISN'T ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THERE'S CERTAIN- FUMIGANTS AND DECIDES IN HERBICIDES IT THEY HAVE TO HAVE THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE FOR THESE PESTICIDES AND HERBICIDES AND THEY USE THEM AS MOST FARMERS THE FIRST POLICY THAT'S A COST NUMBER ONE TO APPLICATIVE TO YOU TO BY THE CHEMICAL TO ALWAYS IN THE COST TO IT AND SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO DRIVE OUR COST DOWN. BECAUSE WE COMPETE IN A GLOBAL MARKET I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GETS MISSED IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS THE WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL MARKET. AS WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT WANTING TO BE THE LEADERS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL- SPACE AND WE ARE WE HAVE THE SAFEST FOOD IN THE WORLD AND WE PRODUCE. THE GREATEST VARIETY OF COMMODITIES IN THE WORLD HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE DO A REALLY GOOD JOB AT IT BUT FARMERS HAVE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND WHEN YOU TO STAY IN BUSINESS MEANS THAT YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST. OTHER COUNTRIES MEXICO. IS A HUGE COMPETITOR OF OURS WHEN IT COMES TO. THE SALAD BOWL OR THOSE TYPES OF COMMODITIES STRAWBERRIES THINGS THAT WITH FRESH FRESH PRODUCE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOR DID THEY HAVE THE SAME LABOR LAWS OR THE I MEAN THE LIST GOES ON AND ON ON. SO IF WE WANT TO BE LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE FARMER ON THE GROUND. IF YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF BUSINESS YOU HAVE DEFEATED YOUR PURPOSE BECAUSE HE'S THEY'RE MOVING TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WHICH THEY STILL SELL THEIR PRODUCTS HERE. BUT IT PUTS THE FARMER IN CALIFORNIA AT A DISADVANTAGE SO I JUST WANTED LATE I WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT ARE. ARE DIFFICULT AS SOMEBODY WHO DOES IT EVERY DAY. I WAS ON A TRACTOR SATURDAY WHEN. WHEN I WAS WORKING ON ONE ACTUALLY WHEN THE CHAIR CALLED ME TO TALK TO ME ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS WE HAD IN THIS. COMING UP IN THIS COMMITTEE. SOMEONE SAY I SUPPORT AG COMMISSIONERS WE HAVETO CALL THEM BEFORE WE APPLY AND LET THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA APPLY. PRODUCT TO OUR FIELD SO THEY KNOW THAT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO WITH THERE'S STANDARDS ON WIND. A. N. ALL KINDS OF PROTOCOLS OF SAFETY FOR YOUR FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. WHEN YOU SPRAY IN FACT I DON'T ALLOW ANY MY PLACE OF WORK TO DO IT I DO IT BECAUSE IT'S JUST A BETTER WAY TO KEEPING. THEM SAFE. BECAUSE OF THE REGULATIONS ARE. VERY STRICT SO I WANT TO SAYI'M I'M A BIG PROPONENT OF THE AG COMMISSIONERS AND THE UC. I'VE DONE MYSELF. PROJECTS ON MY LAND WITH THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION TO. TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FARM IN A MORE. EFFICIENT AND MORE- FRIENDLY SAFE. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONE AREA THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT AND I BELIEVE THAT I'VE SOME OF EVEN I DON'T HAVE A COLLEGE EDUCATION TO PROVE IT. I HAVE A LIFETIME IN THE GENERATIONS OF FAMILY ON THE SAME PIECE OF LAND. MAKING IT GROW THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO EAT. SO I WANT TO JUST THAT'S THE PREFACE OF WHAT WAS IT THE MIL TAX I HAVE A pI HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP COMMENTS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS. IT SEEMS TO ME AS A LEGISLATOR THAT. YOU KNOW ONCE SOMETHING GETS IN THE PIPELINE THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY TO EVER CHANGE IT WHEN IT WHEN IT. ONE IS NOT WORKING RIGHT WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WE'VE BEEN TO I'VE BEEN TALKING IT WITH DPR IN OUR LAST HEARING. EARLIER THIS YEAR. I ASKED THE- THE SECRETARY ABOUT MARIJUANA GROWS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE IN THE POLLUTION. THE MASSIVE POLLUTION THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE RULE- THE URBAN RURAL AREAS. OF THE STATE SO BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION I WANT TO JUST MAKE A STATEMENT TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THIS YEAR THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT STAFFING THIS IS THE DPR WAS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN P. Y. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ENTIRE STAFFING WAS THREE SEVENTY SEVEN POINT TWO WHICH IS EQUATES TO GROWTH OF TWENTY TWO P. WEISS OVER THE FIVE YEARS THE BCP INCREASED THE NUMBER OF P. WISE BY FIFTY ONE IN JUST TWO YEARS. SO CONNECTED THIS IS MY QUESTION CAN THE DEPARTMENT FIND THAT MANY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS TO FILL THESE POSITIONS. SOME GROWTH MAY BE REASONABLE BUT THIS IS ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GROWTH WE WENT FROM A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR. I B. I P. M. FUNDING TO EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION. THAT'S A SEVENTEEN FOLD IN A VERY SHORT TIME SO. AS IT AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN AROUND GOVERNMENT MAYBE TOO LONG TO FIND OUT THAT. CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET IT DONE WE HAD THE HEARING A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. LOOKING AT OIL WELLS AND THERE WAS TWENTY SIX POSITIONS IN THAT AND THEY HAD THEY HAD HIRED THREE IN THE YEAR IN THE US FOR TWENTY SIX MORE SO I'D LIKE TO. LET SEVEN THOUSAND ELECT TO HAVE THEIR INTERNAL SOCIAL JEANNIE TALK ABOUT THE- INCREASE IN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDES AND IT CAN THEY GET THE QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO EVEN AND IT IS OUR THE RESEARCHERS AT. AVAILABLE AT THE UC'S DUST DUST IS THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. SENATOR DOLLY I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND YOUR QUESTIONS HERE AND YOU SPEAK WITH REAL AUTHORITY ON THESE ISSUES AND I'M SURE YOU ARE THE ONLY LEGISLATOR TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE CARDS IN YOUR WALLET. AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE WORKED WITH BOTH YOUR AYE COMMISSIONERS IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE PR STAFF PRESUMABLY OVER THE YEARS. ON THOSE ISSUES. YOU KNOW YOU RAISED SOME GREAT POINTS ABOUT. THE USE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND PRACTICES AROUND THE STATE AND SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YOU POINTED OUT THE- YOU KNOW I PM THAT BIG IPM TOOLBOX CONTAINS THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE USING IN YOUR OPERATION. AND THAT FARMERS ARE USING ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT IT DOES IS ALSO FOCUSES THOUGH ON. A MORE SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO MANAGE PESTS IN THE BIO CONTROLS AND CULTURAL PRACTICES. HABITAT MODIFICATION THAT'S ALSO A CENTRAL PART OF I. P. WITH REGARDS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT STAFFING- YOU KNOW OUR STAFF HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BECAUSE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE GROWN OVER THE LAST. SEVERAL YEARS AND WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO MORE AS A DEPARTMENT. AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITIES IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THAT WE'VE REALLY DONE A LOT OF WONDERFUL WORK THERE- WITH REGARDS TO BRINGING NEW STAFF ON SIR YOU KNOW THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR. A STATE AGENCIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN CHALLENGING FOR US BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. A LOT OF QUALITY CANDIDATES FOR WORK HERE DPR- YOU KNOW I HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE. A NUMBER OF WHICH ARE IN THE FIELD THE BULK OF WHICH ARE IN SACRAMENTO AND THEIR SCIENTISTS AND GETTING ON. A HIGHLY QUALIFIED ECO TOXICOLOGIST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA EFFORT BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. AND IN TERMS OF THE EXPANSION OF THE IPM PROGRAM WHERE WE'LL SEE. A NUMBER OF NEW STAFF I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE ON BOARD TO HELP US DELIVER THESE PROGRAMS FOR. CALIFORNIANS AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY ON THE CAMPUS ISSUE YOU AND I HAD A GOOD EXCHANGE WHEN I WAS BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND SINCE THEN WE'VE DONE SOME FOLLOW UP. WITH YOUR STAFF ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE STATE TO. ADDRESS THE POLLUTION THAT YOU FIND AT ILLEGAL GROW SITES. WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND COUNTY SHERIFF'S WHERE WE CAN. AND BEFORE TOO LONG I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER TO COME UP TO YOUR DISTRICT AND- AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF A TOUR BUT- WE'RE WORKING HARD ON THAT AS WELL. I THINK YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL PART OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND STAFF I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT I WHEN I ALSO WANTED. IT THANK YOU FOR THE- WHAT MY ACTUALLY MY- ASSEMBLY WOMAN DOLLY DID A TOUR AND ASKED FOR SOMEBODY TO COME FROM THE DEPARTMENT- UP TO SISKIYOU AND- THEY WERE ABLE TO. MEET THAT OBLIGATION SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT- DURING OUR EQ HEARING I MENTION IT TO SENATOR ALAN AND- IF THE CHEROKEE Q. WHO WHAT WAS GOING TO GO AS WELL SO WE'RE GONNA DO A TOUR- SOON AND I. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT SOMEBODY FROM THE AGENCY IS ABLE TO GO AND SEE- WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE ENVIRONMENT- MAINLY AND- SISKIYOU COUNTY IT'S OUT OF CONTROL AND NOT RIGHT. SO I THOUGHT. SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WAS THE BURN IF THAT'S OKAY WE. WE MOVED INTO THAT IS IF WE MAY. SO THOSE ARE NOT FRUSTRATION MIND- SO AS MANY LEGISLATORS KNOW THAT I'VE I'VE WORKED ON BIOMASS FOR IT SEEMS LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE- IT IS COMPLICATED AND IT'S DIFFICULT AND- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT MAINLY ON THE ON THE FOREST FIRE PART BUT- WHEN WE DID. AB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH WAS A TRAILER BILL SOMETIME AGO I'VE WE ACTUALLY EXTENDED BIOMASS CONTRACTS ARE OF FORCED THE UTILITIES TO BUY ENERGY FOR BIOMASS PLANTS IN THE IN THE E. J. COMMUNITY CAME IN AND MANY IN IN MANY INSTANCES AND OPPOSED OUR LEGISLATION- AND MAINLY IN THE VALLEY AND SO- WE HAD A 60% HI HI HI. HI THE FUEL HAZARD ZONES AND 40% COULD COME FROM ANYWHERE ELSE AND THAT GOT CHANGED IN THE SENATE THAT TIME I WAS IN THIS ASSEMBLY BUT BUT THE POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OPEN BURN. AND YOU TALK ABOUT THE VALLEY THE BASIN AND THERE ARE HUGE CHALLENGES AS- WAS STATED EARLIER ABOUT JUST THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE VALLEY AND HOW. IT DOESN'T CARRY THOSE EMISSIONS OUT SO IF YOU'RE GONNA IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA IT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA OPEN BURN. IT IF YOU CAN BURN IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT IT'S A LOT LESS- CARBON IN AND POLLUTANTS. AND BUT DURING THE LAST EIGHT YEARS OF WRANGLING THE E. J. COMMUNITY IN THE VALLEY HAS OPPOSED. USING BIOMASS PLANTS AND THEY SHUT HIM DOWN SO THERE IS NO PLACE NOW FOR THE FARMER TO TAKE THAT ALMOND TREE- OR IN THE SMALL FARMERS IN THE BIG FARMERS FARMERS THE I HEARD THE SECRETARY ROSS TALK ABOUT DOING SOME. YOU KNOW- MULCHING IN PUTTING THAT BACK IN THE SO AS A FARMER I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU- SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE ON THE GROUND AND SEE YES YOU CAN. YOU CAN TAKE THE BIOMASS AND PUT IT BACK IN THE GROUND IN A BUILDER SO WE ALL KNOW THAT I DO I USE BIO CHAR MY OWN FARMS IS AS A- AS A- A SOIL. ADDITIVE THAT IS VERY HELPFUL IN THIS AND STORES CARBON AT THE SAME TIME. BUT THE PROCESS IS THAT ACTUALLY A TAP ON THE GROUND ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND NOT EASY TO DO AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR SOME OF THOSE. PROJECTS IN INTO QUITE FRANKLY IN SOME IN JUST LET PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT I DON'T WANT I WILL I GET IS THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. YOU CAN'T FORCE EVERYBODY IN THE SAME BOX OR HAS TO BE MORE THAN ONE TOOL. TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND IF WE DON'T HAVE BIOMASS PLANTS THAT BURN. YES THEY BURN AND THEY AND THEY BECAUSE EMISSIONS BUT THE MISSIONS ARE SO MUCH LESS THAN AN OPEN BURN. AND WHEN THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION THAT'S A BETTER OPTION THAN AN OPEN BURN OPTION AND SO- I JUST WANT TO TIE THAT IN TO. TO THE SUSTAINABLE FARMING MEANS THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET EVERY THERE'S NOT EVERY SINGLE FARM IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE ALL THESE TREES BACK INTO THEIR FARM IT JUST IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THAT. TO BREAK DOWN AND ACTUALLY BECOME ORGANIC MATERIAL THAT'S GOING TO BE USABLE AND STORE THAT CARBON. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THAT WE YOU KNOW. IN SACRAMENTO WE TALK ABOUT FARMING AND WHEN YOU GET ON THE FARM IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT. IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALLGAME. AND I WANTED TO TIE THAT BACK TO MY- OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT. IF WE DON'T HAVE CALIFORNIA FARMERS HERE. YOU KNOW. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY. PEOPLE I KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN. FARMING IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME WHO JUST PUT A CONSERVATION EASEMENT ON THEIR LAND AND WALKED AWAY FROM IT. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY YOU TO FOLLOW YOUR TO SET IT ASIDE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. NO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN SOON BUT IT'S HAPPENING INCREMENTALLY AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE. SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR- I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A REAL GOOD CLOSE LOOK AT THIS MAIL- P. AND HOWARD'S. HOUSE DIVIDED UP IN THE AG COMMUNITY ARE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE LAND. AND IF YOU GO OUT AND MEET WITH AND THEY'RE AWESOME PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE PEOPLE ARE GREAT THAT COMMISSIONERS ARE AWESOME WE HAVE SEVERAL THERE WERE AT LEAST WHEN I WAS AT THE COUNTY WE HAD SEVERAL AG COMMISSIONER'S. POSITIONS OPEN IS A VERY DIFFICULT- REQUIREMENT TO BE AN AG COMMISSIONER SOME ACT MISTERS WERE SHARED WITH OTHER COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST PARTNER THERE A TECHNICAL AND IT'S A RIGOROUS- THE SCHOOLING TO GET TO WHERE THEY TO GET THEM AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS THAT WE CAN IF WE CAN GET TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GO HERE SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE'S TWO AND A HALF. MILL IS. PART OF THE FEES ARE IN THERE FOR ACT. OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY. IMPORT RE HAVE DO YOU THINK YOU NEED TO YOU WANT TO DO ON THIS FIVE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DOLLAR RECORD SENATE AGRICULTURAL PROPOSAL. HEY CHRIS LEISURE KNOW WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WOULD JUST START OFF. BY SAYING WE'RE STILL IN THE SENATE AGRICULTURAL BUDGET PLAN- BUT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS. JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT IN RELATION TO- THE MIDDLE SEGMENT- AS NOTED IN THE SENATE ACT PACKAGE IT ONLY INCLUDES LIMITED TERM GENERAL FUND FOR THE TRANSITION TO SAFER SUSTAINABLE PEST MANAGEMENT- WHICH I SECRETARY. MENTION IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT ADDRESS THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OVERALL- IN TERMS OF A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. OR THEY NEED TO EXPAND IDEA ANOTHER ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- THAT YOUR NOSE THAT'S WHEN APPROACH WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A SUSTAINABLE. LONGER TERM SOLUTION- THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE APPROPRIATE REFERENCE REVENUE SOURCE- THE MIDDLE ASSESSMENT RATHER THAN A JOB. THANK YOU MISS A STEP TOWARD YOU DON'T IT'S OKAY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT ONE OF THE SENATE PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE IT'S ALL RIGHT WE LIKE THAT WE LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS A PARTNERSHIP. I KNOW SOMETIMES WERE HERE IN SUB TOO BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY OKAY FOR FINANCES SAY. GOODNESS GRACIOUS THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN UP WILL IT'LL IT'LL BE BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEES AND THE SECOND TIME THINKS. EVERYBODY WHO TESTIFIED AND PARTICIPATED AND LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FOUR WHICH IS ANOTHER SMALL SENATE PROPOSAL FOR A WILDFIRE PREVENTION. RESILIENCY PACKAGE THIS. OPPOSES OF FIVE. DOLLAR PROGRAM OVER A FIVE YEAR IN LET'S HEAR FROM THE- KELLY ALSO OFFICE TO BE THIS. GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS HELEN CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE THIS MORNING OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE SENATE'S WILDFIRE PACKAGE FOR YOU TODAY. BUT BEFORE YOU JUMP INTO TE PROPOSED PACKAGE I WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BRIEF CONTEXT ON RECENT WILDFIRES IN THE STATE AND THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST MONTH. WITH REGARD TO RECENT FIRES- I DO YOU KNOW I WANTED TO NOTE THAT AND MANY OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S RECORDED HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND OF COURSE TWENTY TWENTY WAS A PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING WILDFIRE YOUR FOR THE STATE. THE PATTERN OF INCREASED WILDFIRE RISK IS BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL FOREST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASED DEVELOPMENT IN THE WETLANDS. NOTABLY UNCONTROLLED LARGE WILDFIRES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT WE THOUGHT RAVAGE THE STATE LAST YEAR CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ECONOMY AND OF COURSE STATE AND LOCAL BUDGETS. THE LAST MONTH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT ALLOCATED VERY SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TOWARDS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE INCLUDED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR FOR ROUGHLY TWO DOZEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS OVER HALF OF THE FENCE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION SUPPORTED PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROMOTE HEALTHY FORESTS AND LANDSCAPES GENERALLY BY REMOVING. HAZARDOUS FUELS. MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE- HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION. THE END STILL. DATE OF WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS AND THE REMAINING FUNDS TOTALING FIFTY FIVE. TO PRY FROM. CAN HARD. FORCED ECONOMIC. AND SCIENCE BASED ME FOR MANAGED. I SO ARE THE TOTAL WAS FOR MOST OF IT FOR HUNDRED NUMBER MILLION WAS FROM THE FUND A ONE TIME. HI THERE ARE FINDS HUNDRED TWO FIVE MILLION WERE FROM G. YEAR AT. CONSISTENT WITH ASKING. OH ONE. THIRTY EIGHT. OF THE EARLY ACT WELFARE PACKAGE WITH A- TO ENABLE. TO START WORK. ON CRIED RATHER THAN WAITING TILL PASSAGE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IN I STARTED WORK IMMEDIATELY ADMIN. IN THE- THAT IT ANTICIPATES THE PROJECT WILL BE IN PLACE. ROUGHLY ONE FIRE SEASONS THANTHEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE. AND WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE STATE IS AT SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR ANOTHER VERY BAD FIRE SEASON THIS YEAR GIVEN HOW HOT AND DRY IT SPENT. WITH THE EARLY ACTION WELFARE WAS PASSED WAS AND KNOWLEDGE MEN MAN MAN. BUT IT WAS REALLY A FOR STEP I BASED. CERTAINLY BUT A FIRST STEP AND THEN WORKED ANYBODY CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. WITH THAT CONTACTS THE THING PROPOSE. IT PACKAGE ADDS THIS NEXT STEP. AND THE PACKAGE INCLUDES BILLION DOLLAR. IN FUNDING FOR USED OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY BY LANDS. REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES I NAY COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT TO WILDFIRES WHEN THEY DO OCCUR. THIS IS A GREAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL PROVIDES FOR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO BE SET ASIDE IN A NEW SPECIAL FUNDS THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE SPENT. THE INTENT IS THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE USED FROM THIS BAND AND IT WOULD BE WOULD BE APPROPRIATED EACH YEAR BY THE LEGISLATURE- AND THAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR FIVE YEARS. AND THE SENATE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR FROM TWO YEAR AFTER FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT IS WITH A SENSE EXTEND THE COMMITMENT UNDER SB. NINE A ONE. SO NOW TO BUY YEAR. FOR THE BUDGET THE SAN PACKAGE PROVIDE ONE BILLION DOLLARS SO IT EIGHT HUNDRED AND- ABOUT BE FROM THE- PREVENTION AND- FIND INTO MY- MILLION. EACH YEAR. IT WOULD BE ALLOCATED AS- IN THE- TART ON PAGE TWO OF THE AGENDA- THERE'S A- GOING IN THIS FIGURE OUT TRY TO WATCH IT WATCH THROUGH IT. I THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN SIXTH. THE FIRST K. THAT YOU'LL SEE IN. TABLE IS RESULT. WILDLY SOME. THAN HALF OF THE FACT. FIVE THIRTY. WE GO TOWARDS. IN THIS CASE. AND THESE PLEASE. WERE GENERALLY MAKE WHILE LANDS MORE RESILIENT. VERY HAS. FUEL THIS INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND- FIVE. FOR FOREST. PROGRAM FIFTY NINE. FOR THE FOURTH IMPROVE MY PROGRAM FOR SMALL- TWENTY MILLION THE FOURTH. LEGACY AND- NURSE. PROGRAM FIFTEEN. FOR URBAN FORESTRY. NINETEEN MILLION FOR TRAVELING GAUGE MEANT. NINETY MILLION. FOR EACH OF TWO DEPARTMENT THAT DEPART. PARKS ARE. AND THE- OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. TO SUPPORT WHILE. MANY ON THE LAND. AND IN A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION TO VARIOUS CONSERVANCY TO SUPPORT FOREST. AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. THE NEXT CATEGORY IS WHILE FUEL. ABOUT A QUARTER OF THIS IN THE- TO HUNDRED FIVE. WE GO TOWARDS THESE WILDFIRE KILL BREAKS BASICALLY FORTY MILLION FOR CALIFORNIANS FIRE CREWS PROJECTS EIGHTY MILLION FOR FIRE PREVENTION GRANT FORTY MILLION FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE ENHANCECREATORS TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THE FORESTRY CORPS PROGRAM. AND SIXTY MILLION FOR THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM. THE REMAINING CORE. OF THE FIND THE PAST WOULD BE ACROSS NEXT K. COMMUNITY HARDENING STANCE BASED MANAGE. ECONOMIC STIMULUS- SOME OTHER PROGRAM. WITH REGARD TO COMMUNITY HARD NAY. THERE'S ABOUT A FORTY FIVE MILLION THIS CASE- AND MOST OF IT THIRTY MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS HOME HARDENING THE REST. WOULD GO TOWARDS DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS SEVEN MILLION FOR THAT ACTIVITY AS WELL AS LAND USE PLANNING AND PUBLIC EDUCATION OUTREACH AND THERE'S EIGHT MILLION FOR THAT. I NEXT SPENT BASED MANAGEMENT THERE'S FIFTY THREE MILLION FOR THIS CATEGORY WHICH INCLUDES TWENTY MILLION FOR ECOLOGICAL MONITORING AND RESEARCH. FIFTEEN MILLION FOR REMOTE SENSING FIVE MILLION FOR PERMIT EFFICIENCIES EIGHT MILLION FOR THE USE OF SATELLITE DATA. I'M SORRY FINALLY THE SATELLITE DATA AND EIGHT MILLION TO CONDUCT WILDFIRE COMING ADAPTATION. SO NEXT OF COURSE CAN TO THERE'S NINE MILLION FOR THIS CAT. WHICH IS THIRTY THREE MILLION KIND OF FOR. TWENTY MILLION FOR WORK ABOUT. SIX MILLION FOR MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND TEN MILLION FOR TRANSPORTATION GRANTS FOR TIMBER AND WOOD REMOVAL. FINALLY I THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT MILLION PROPOSED FOR OTHER PROGRAMS MOST OF THIS IS A FIFTY MILLION IS PROPOSED FOR FOREST AND WATERSHED HEALTH. PROJECTS THERE'S ALSO EIGHT MILLION FOR COOLING CENTERS EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND BACKUP SOLAR. SO YOU'LL NOTICE IN THIS TABLE AND IT ALSO HAS A COLUMN THAT SHOWS WHAT WAS IN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGING YOU'LL NOTICE THAT MANY OF THIS MANY SIMILAR PROGRAMS WERE FUNDED AS PART OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE BUT THIS- CERTAINLY AUGMENT THE FUNDING TOWARDS. THOSE PROGRAMS I ALSO FIND A FEW NEW PROGRAMS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE SENATE PROPOSES ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS AND EVALUATION MEASURES AND THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE ASSESSED THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE ACHIEVED WITH THE SPENCER THIS IS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION OF. STATE FUNDING AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP AND ENSURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT THAT THE RESULTS OF SPENDING IN THE THESE FUNDS ARE AND CAN HOPEFULLY INFORM FUTURE DECISION MAKING ON THE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE. THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU MR CARSON LET'S A LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCES- SECRETARY CROWFOOT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SENATE PROPOSAL. FOR IT SO MUCH SENATOR WILL LISTEN FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE SENATE LEADERSHIP IN PASSING THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. I CAN REPORT THAT THANKS TO THAT ACTION AND STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE PURCHASING EQUIPMENT. I IN REAL TIME CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO SURGE UP ON PROJECTS AND WE'RE GETTING A FUNDING OUT TO GRANTEES IN REAL TIME. SO BIG THANKS- WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND ALL THE PROPOSALS HERE TODAY. I THINK THERE IS BROAD ALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE SENATE ON THIS WILDFIRE APPROACH CLEARLY WE ALL RECOGNIZE THERE NEEDS TO BE A QUANTUM LEAP. OF INVESTMENT. INTO UP FRONT PROACTIVE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WE TALK ABOUT REALLY THREE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES. INVESTMENTS WITHIN COMMUNITIES ON HARDENING DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PLANNING AROUND COMMUNITIES ARE WITH THESE EMBLEMATIC. OP ARE MERGING SEA PRODUCTIVE FUEL BREAKS AND ACROSS LANDSCAPES WE USED TO CALL US FOREST MANAGEMENT BUT THAT'S A MISNOMER THIS IS LAY. MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZING THAT ACROSS CALIFORNIA OUR. COMMUNITIES I HAVE DIFFERENT LANDS IT'S OUR THEM WHETHER THAT'S- OR- OAK WOODLAND ARE KIND OF FOR. THIS BUDGET FOR THE FOR TIME- REAL CONSCIOUSLY AVOID A ONE FITS ALSO FROM SAN. REALLY IDENTIFY THAT ARE REGIONAL. AND WHILE. CHALLENGES AND THEIR WHILE BY SAFETY. REALLY PROUD THAT OUR BUDGET IN IN THE DEBATE OF REGIONAL PRIORITIES- THAT WILL FOCUS MOST IMPORTANTLY ON PROTECTING THE COMMUNITIES FROM THE UNIQUE THREATS IN EACH REGION. I AND SO WE FIND THE OUTSIDE INVESTMENT INTO THAT THOSE REGIONAL PRIORITY SETTING AND THEN OUR GOAL WITH THIS WAS BUDGET IS TO OVER TIME OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ACTUALLY IN BASK. IN THE PIPELINE OF PRIORITIZE PROJECTS DOES NOT START AGAIN STOP AGAIN- ALSO MENTIONED THAT WE MAKE WE CAN IN SOUND INSTITUTIONAL TO GETTING MORE DONE INCLUDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GETTING MORE TRAIN FOLKS ACTUALLY OUT THERE TO DO THE WORK SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. WE CAN MOBILIZE SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR MORE RURAL AREAS TO ACTUALLY DO MORE OF THIS WORK AND THEN CRITICALLY REGULATORY EFFICIENCY FRANKLY HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN TOO HARD TO DO THE WORK WE NEED TO ACROSS LANDSCAPE AND GROWTH SO. THROUGH EFFICIENCIES LIKE THIS OUR VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM PROGRAMMATIC E. IR WE'RE CREATING ESSENTIALLY- I STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR APPROVAL OF THE LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PROJECTS WHAT USED TO TAKE YEARS WELL. NOW TAKE MONTHS. SO BETTER REALLY- WITH YOU KNOW YOUR LEADER IN ALL THE ON THE- AND GLAD TO. I'M YOU AND QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE A MENTOR HUGE. REPORTER HIS TEAM CAL BY. THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY THE CORNERS OF THIS. THIS IS TRUE A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT THOUGH INCLUDE I HAD TO. ACROSS OUR AGENCY AND ACROSS OTHER AGE AS SO MY JESSICA MORE HERE TO ANSWER SPECIFIC AS- I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY YOU SEE THAT THERE'S MONEY IN THERE FOR. SUBSIDIZING TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THERE'S ADDITIONAL MONEY IN THERE FOR PLANTING TREES IT IS ONE THING TO HAVE IN THEIR THREE CREEK TO TREES. AND GET THE TREES IN IN THE GROUNDS WORK WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED- I GUESS SAID DEPUTY MOSS FOR MORRIS. OF THAT THE WE DON'T KNOW IF THOSE TO THE RIGHT NUMBERS BUT WE'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR INPUT ON THAT AND ATTENTION AS YOU GUYS GO THROUGH YOU'RE- A REVISION YOU TALK TO THE FINANCE DOWNSTAIRS. ON IF THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER AGAIN THIS IS A FIVE YEAR PROGRAM SO. THE ATTENTION TO MORE TREE PLANTING MORE MARIE. OF WHAT PRODUCTS FROM THE FOREST FLOOR TO GET TO THESE BIOMASS FACILITIES WOULD BE IMPORTANT. YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. DEPUTY WELL LET ME JUST SAY FOR PHILOSOPHICALLY I IT TURNED OVER JUST MOMENT THE PHILOSOPHE WE ARE. THAT WE NEED TO. LEVERAGE MORE PRIVATE AND BASS. IN EAGLE I BASE. LANDSCAPE RAJ. SIMPLY PUT TAXPAYER DOLLARS BE AT THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO ACTUALLY DO THE AMOUNT OF. ENVIRONMENTALLY BASED- LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO SO. WE'VE IDENTIFIED OBVIOUSLY PROPOSED INVESTMENTS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALL HAVE. IDENTIFIED ADDITION PROPOSED- BUT PROBABLY I SPEAKING I THINK WORKFORCE. ALIGNED JUST GOT. ABSOLUTELY AND SAM WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT PROPOSAL WE PUT FORWARD I'M MOVING FORWARD AND WITH WHAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF- CONSENSUS AND CLARITY AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE REALLY ON LEVERAGE BUSINESS AND CAN USE THIS INVESTMENT. TO NOT ONLY HELP JUMPSTART CATALYZED MORE BUSINESSES IN THIS SECTOR PARTICULARLY IN MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVEN'T HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES- BUT THEN HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT AT LEAST IS BECOMES A SUSTAINABLE OPERATION AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE AREAS. THAT WE PROPOSED IN THE STRATEGY IN THAT- IS GOING FORWARD IN THE BUDGET WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CLIMATE CATALYST WHICH IS CREATING SMALL BUSINESS LOANS TO HELP AND UP SMALL BUSINESSES WHETHER IT'S IN THE WOOD INNOVATION SECTOR SO. IN THE ANNUAL OF THIS BIOMASS OR IN THE TRADITION SACK WHERE YOU'RE AT- MICRO THAT GO THE BACK OF PICKUP TRUCKS THAT. SMALLER WOULD COMING OUT OF THE IS SHIP- AND TO WIN BUT INSTEAD HAS NOT. TO BE MAILED IN LUMBER AND CREATE JOBS THAT'S ALSO WHY WE'RE NOT IN THE WERE FORCE YOU ASPECTS OF THIS PROGRAM LIGHT ADVANCEMENT IN. COLLEGES HELP TRAINER FOR THIS AND INVEST TO GROW LIKE CHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP EACH SIERRA COUNTY- CALAVERAS COUNTY AND- AND EIGHT TRIBES IN THE AREA THAT WILL HELP THAT TRAINED THEM IN BECOMING BUT WORK CREWS SHOW THAT THE WORK IN INVESTMENT WE'RE PUTTING ON THE LANDSCAPE. IS ACTION WORSE IN A LONG TERM AREN'T RELIABLE EFFORTS AND ONE ASPECT I WANT TO POINT OUT IN OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WENT FORWARD IS WE REQUESTED LONGER. HER ON THESE DOLLARS FOR THEM TO BE AN EXPANDED- OVER ABOUT YEAR PERIOD IN THE FROM IS SO THE WOULD BE BY CAN LARGER CRY. AND THEN THE COMMUNITY CAN OR. YES WE DID HEAR THEM ON THAT ONE BECAUSE THE FIVE YEAR PLAN INCREASES THAT YOU KNOW CONTINUED FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO GO ON AND MORE TIME TO SPEND THAT BEFORE I GET TO CHIEF- PORTER CAN YOU COMMENT QUICKLY ON THE MONIES THAT'S- DIRECTED TO THE PARK AND RECREATION STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM AND FISH AND WILDLIFE WHAT. A SECRETARY CROWFOOT WHAT THIS MIGHT MEAN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INVESTMENT FOR OF RESILIENT WILDLAND SAID THOSE TWO AGENCIES INTO THE STATE'S SYSTEM. YEAH WE HAVE TO WALK THE WALK WITH STATE LANDS AND PARKS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE. STEWARDS SOME OF OUR MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDS IN THE STATE. AND HISTORICALLY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN THE INVESTMENTS IN PROACTIVE YOU KNOW. LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT RESILIENCE MEASURES. SO THIS IS A HUGE INVESTMENT AND PROTECTING BEES BE SENSITIVE LANDSCAPES. ARE STATE PARKS IMPRESSION WILDLIFE ARE ARE READY TO DO THE WORK AND AS I MENTIONED BECAUSE THEY'VE RECEIVED SOME FUNDING IN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY OUT THERE I GETTING THE EQUIPMENT AND AS JESSICA MENTIONED YOU KNOW THAT THE LENGTH OF OUR PROPOSED INVESTMENT. WILL ALLOW ACTUALLY THE PROJECTS THERE YOU KNOW CONTINUE AND HAS TO WORK THROUGH THESE PIPELINES OF PROJECTS. BECAUSE STATE PARKS IN ECOLOGICAL PRESERVES OUR NEXT TO PRIVATE LANDS THIS ALSO DOES A BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING THOSE PRIVATE LANDS AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE. VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT DOES. DIRECTOR PORTER WITH CALIFORNICA I THINK YOU'RE HERE THANK YOU HERE GOOD MORNING ANYTHING IN THIS FIVE YEAR SENATE PACKAGE THAT YOU LIKE THAT YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON. WELL YOU GOOD MORNING- SHARE Y. CASKEY AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- WHAT I'D SAY ABOUT- OUR OUR- THE BUDGET THAT IS PROPOSED IS THAT IT REALLY IS A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS- AND THAT TRULY IS- THAT WE NEED A- HOLISTIC SOLUTION- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT LANDSCAPE RESILIENCE- WE NEED TO BE% LOOKING AT FUEL REDUCTION PROJECT WORK IN BETWEEN. AND LOOKING AT- DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE HOMES AND COMMUNITIES AND WE FEEL THAT OUR- EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS- THAT WE'VE BEEN FEEDING AND- SB NINE NO ONE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE- THAT THOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO MOVING US FORWARD AS A STATE- THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS- THAT CAME OUT OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT- TO THE GOVERNOR IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ALL OF THEM. I HAVE. IN THOSE PROGRAMS- AND CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO DO A FIRE PREVENTION AND INCREASE OUR NEED IS THAT THE- DEMONSTRATED NEEDFOR MORE RESOURCES TO DO THAT TYPE OF WORK AND TOO RESPONSE TO WILDFIRES AS THEY OCCUR. A DRUG TO PORTER I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT TO- TREAT OR TO PAY ATTENTION TO A MILLION ACRES IN THE FOREST LAND IN AND GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL LOOK FOR ONE BILLION DOLLARS SAID WEPRESUME TO ACHIEVE THAT SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THIS WAS. WAS THE BILLION DOLLARS THAT FROM THE JANUARY BUDGET WAS THAT ENOUGH TO TREAT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ACRES WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA PORTION IF THIS WERE TO PASS AND THERE WAS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS THAT GIVE US SOME ADDITIONAL THE OR CAN YOU TELL US HOW WE HOW THAT'S GOING TO TREAT THE GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AND THEN. NATURALLY BEGS THE QUESTION HOW OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS DOING- WE LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS IS A SIGNAL TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THAT TOO THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION AND THIS LEGISLATURE SERIOUS ABOUT ATTACKING THIS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM PUT SOME MONEY ON THE TABLE ALSO SO IF YOU COULD ADD. THAT ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. D. FOR YOU OKAY OKAY IF I JUST SOME LEVEL- BRING UP. SO AS YOU KNOW CENTER THE GOVERNOR WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE CHIEF LAST SUMMER SIGNED THIS SHARED STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT COMMITTING EACH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PER YEAR. OUR PROPOSED BUDGET FROM JANUARY WOULD ACHIEVE THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ALL WE THINK A YEAR OR TWO EARLY SO WE WOULD BE MEETING OUR OUR- COMMITMENT. IT'S VERY CLEAR TO US AND WE MADE IT CLEAR PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS INVESTMENT INTO ITS REGIONAL AGENCIES MEET THEIR COMMITMENT. AND THE GOVERNOR'S HAD CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY AND WE'VE HAD. GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR CALIFORNIA DELEGATION SO. I REMAIN HOPEFUL ACTUALLY WILL SEE. A COMPARABLE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT ARE SIGNIFICANT SIZEABLE INCREASE OF INVESTMENT IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE ON THE HOOK WITH THAT COMMITMENT FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL AGENCIES. I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ULTIMATELY THE FEDERAL BUDGET THAT COMES OUT AND. PROVIDING THE CAPACITY FOR THEM TO DO THAT. OUR CHIEF ANYTHING YOU WANT ADD THEIR- NO SECRETARY GROWTH WHAT YOU YOU HIT IT RIGHT ON- THIS INITIAL INVESTMENT WILL GET US- TO THAT NUMBER SOONER THAN WE WOULD HAVE WITHOUT IT. EXCELLENT PROBLEM IN THESE THERE'S A OF A MIX CHIEF WITH THEM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GOING DIRECTLY TO CAL FIRE IN THE GRANT PROGRAM YOU RENT AND OUR PARTNERS IN THE CONSERVANCY THAT ARE DOING WORKING CAN YOU. ENLIGHTEN US OF HOW THE CONSERVANCY'S AND CAL FIRE WORK TOGETHER. ON THE SAND ON THE PROPOSAL OR- HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE WORKING TOGETHER BETTER. OTHER POLLS OUT. IT CHAIR I WILL A REFERENCE ONLY THE CAL FIRE PIECE OF THAT- WE ARE COORDINATED WE DO HAVE A REGULAR MEETINGS AND- AND TALK ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN'T AND THERE ISN'T- UNNECESSARY OVERLAP BUT THERE IS COORDINATION AND- SO THAT IS- VERY WELL TUNED PROCESS WHAT- IS IMPORTANT I THINK TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT THESE GRANT PROGRAMS ARE OVERSEE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND WE ARE ABLE TO- OF FUND THE PROJECTS AND GET THEM ON THE GROUND AND HOUSE FOR THE NEXT ROUND CYCLE WHEN IT COMES OR BE ABLE TO SHIFT BETWEEN ARE DIFFERENT- CONSERVANCY'S OR IT OR DEPARTMENTS- APPLICATIONS THAT. THAT MEET THAT. NEEDS TO WHERE THE MONEY IS. WE JUST. I WOULD JUST THAT THE TEMPERATURE STATE CONSERVE IS WE HAVE A REMARKABLE TOOLS ACTUALLY NEED A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE BALLS THANKS HERE IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY FOR EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED REGIONAL PRIORITIZED- PROJECTS THAT THINK AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING OUR CONSERVANCY THEN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LIKE WHY SAN DIEGO RIVERS CONSERVANCY FOR EXAMPLE IS TAKING THIS EARLY ACTION FUNDING PLUGGING IT DIRECTLY INTO PROJECTS THAT DEVELOP. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE INVESTMENT IN CONSERVANCIES ARE CERTAINLY COMPLIMENTARY TO CAL FIRE- BOTH CAL FIRE IN THE CONSERVANCIES ARE GONNA BE IN THE SAME ROOM DEVELOPING THESE REGIONAL PRIORITIES- WITH THEIR RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT WITH THE COUNTY AND WITH THE CITY- SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHERE DOES BRINGING- YOU KNOW MORE MORE TOOLS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BY GOD BY RESOURCING CONSERVANCY THAT ONLY HOPE THAT THE MONEY THAT THE OPR HAS ON THE WILDFIRE ADAPTATION PLANS AND CLIMATE AT A- ADJUSTMENTS THIS COLLABORATIVE CENTER IN THERE ARE ALL EVERYBODY'S IN THE ROOM AND WE CAN WE CAN SAY OKAY THIS IS WHERE THEY- A CUTE FIRE DANGER IS. THIS IS A GRANT PROGRAM THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR OWN MONEY AND THAT HOW THOSE THINGS CAN GET PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE PROJECTS. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- LET'S FINANCED FIT FOR I GET THE MEMBERS MEMBERS. HAVE QUESTIONS. YOU HAVE. ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THIS. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL. MORNING HERE IN IN MEMBERS AND STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YEAH SO WE'RE AT WORK WE'RE STILL REVIEWING REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL THE AND WE IGNORE ALL IS THAT IT INCLUDES NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT WE WERE WORKING ON THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT APPROACH IT'S OBVIOUSLY HELPFUL AFTER CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND- FOR REVIEWING IT- OBVIOUSLY WILL BE A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO BE ABLE TO- TALK ABOUT HOW THIS WORKS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION ONCE THE MAYOR VERSIONS RELEASED SO WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THIS AS WERE AS WERE GETTING THEIR VISION BUTTONED UP IN AND OUT AND THEN LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH EARLY. ACTION AND- IS THAT GOING THAT- THE COMMENTARY MADE TODAY. THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE WE THINK IT'S REALLY. A IN THE FIRST. AND WE THINK IT IT REALLY HELPS TO GET SOME THINGS GOING RIGHT AWAY AND- AND JUST LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD AS WE WORKED OUT THAT PACKAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BENSON WE WILL FEEL NO. ILFC TOWARDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE MAY REVISE ACTUALLY EXCEEDS. WHAT THE SENATE IS LAID OUT TODAY IF YOU. ARE SO BOLD DOWNSTAIRS IS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER THAN. LITTLE SUB TO IN THE SENATE THAT WOULD BE OKAY WITH US- OKAY LET'S- LET'S TURN TO VICE YOU'RE DALITS ARE WITH SOME QUESTIONS. WELL I WANTED TO GIVE SENATE MCGUIRE CHANCE IF HE WANTED TO JUMP IN ARE YOU SURE GO HEAD OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I WANT TO START FIRST. FIRST I WANT TO SAY- THIS IS EXCITING TIME I THINK FOR CALIFORNIA TO FIRST OF ALL BE TALKING IN THE TERMS THAT WERE AT LEAST TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I'VE LONG FOR A LONG TIME SO I WANT TO THANK THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN. AND THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE WHO ARE. CHALLENGED WITH THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. PUT THESE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND SO I JUST HAD A QUESTION I KNOW THAT OUR TARGET WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. AND WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MEET THAT GOAL- FINANCIAL WISE THAT'S I THINK SOMETHING THAT. I'D LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED IF YOU HAVE THAT THAT THE INFORMATION. YEAH JESSICA YOU'RE PROBABLY BEST TO CALCULATE THOSE IN YOUR HAD. AND WE SAID THAT YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUDGET BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT BY ONE THOUSAND ACRE GOLF YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO EARLY BUT I THINK WITH THE SENATORS ASKING FOR IS LIKE WHAT'S THE MONEY BUT THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. YEAH IF YOU AVERAGE IT OUT IT COSTS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE- SOME MAKERS ARE CHEAPER SOME MAKERS YOU KNOW ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE BUT ON AVERAGE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ACRE- SO. YOU KIND OF DO THE MATH ON THAT FRONT- BUT ONE OF THE BE YOUR CONSTRAINTS. IS BUT YOU CAN'T JUST PUT MONEY. AT THE PROBLEM AND SAY HERE'S- HERE'S THAT AMOUNT PLEASE GO AND STAND AND DELIVER THE SPEAKERS YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS. THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES WHICH IS WHAT'S SO EXCITING ABOUT THIS BUDGET THAT IT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. THAT HAVE BEEN SLOWING HER PACE SUCH AS- INCREASING THE WORKFORCE. PUTTING MORE EQUIPMENT ON THE LANDSCAPE TO GET THIS WORK DONE. HAVING MORE- PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIVE. I'M AT THE TABLE TO START EXECUTING THIS- AND- I AND SO THAT IS WHAT'S GOING TO BE INCREASING. OUR PACE IN ADDITION. TO THE DIRECT RESOURCES. TO ACTUALLY GET THESE PROJECTS DONE. OKAY THE YOU- SO. WANTED TO JUST STATE I THOUGHT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO CONDUCT ASSESSMENT HAVE THEY HAVE A- HAVE THEY DONE THAT. YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND- SPECIFIC PROJECT THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE REQUESTED FOR THEM TO ASSESS THEIR OWN LAND YES HAS THAT BEEN IS I'VE BEEN COMPLETED AND I BELIEVE THAT'S UNDER WAY WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF THAT PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU- SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO JUST SHARES THAT I DON'T KNOW. THAT I SERVED ON THIS YEAR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY FOR. SEVEN YEARS. AND I THINK THE CONSERVANCIES ARE A GREAT PLACE- TO SEND RESOURCES QUITE FRANKLY THEY- THEY PARTNER- AT LEAST THE SIERRA. CONSERVANCY WHICH I SAID ON ON. DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY OTHER WITH THE OTHER STRUCTURES OF THE OTHER ONES ARE BUT- AND THAT. THEY HAD IN IN ON THE CONCERT IN THE SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER- AND THEY DO A REALLY GOOD JOB OF THE ACTUALLY GETTING PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AROUND COMMITTEE. COMMUNITIES AND THEY WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEY DO THEY THEY- HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTNER THEIR GRANDSONS ERIC EXTEND THE MONIES AND- IN A VERY BROAD WAY TO BRING IN LIKE A QUICK DOLLARS. THEY WORK WITH THE R. C. D.'S IN THE AND THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS I KNOW THAT- DURING THE BUDGET HEARING- ON THE EARLY ACTION STUFF SENATOR THERE TO ASK THE QUESTION. ABOUT WHAT THE PERCENTAGE WAS SO I'M ASSUMING THAT WILL COME LATER I'M NOT ACTUALLY ASKING THAT QUESTION BUT I JUST WOULD SAY THAT. FOR ME. A PRIORITY TO. UP THE AMOUNT TO- THE CONSERVANCY'S- I THINK THEY I THINK IT'S A GOOD DEA I THINK AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT- THE NIGHT THE- I THINK THAT CAN. YOU KNOW HOW FAR IS- THERE FIGHTING FIRES. THE END AND THEY BEEN CONSUMED WITH FIRE THE LAST. COUPLE YEARS AND TO GET THOSE TWO TO GET THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO GET DONE AND AMOUNT ACRES WE NEED TO TREAT- IS A- TALL TASK. AND TO HAVE A NOT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO O THOSE. ON THE GROUND PROJECTS IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. SO I DID WANT TO ASK I DID SEE A MAP AND I DID SEE SOME NUMBERS ABOUT. HOW YOU CALCULATE. THE AMOUNT OF ACRES THAT ARE TREATED AND- I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD ANSWER THIS MAYBE- SECRETARY VELCRO FOOTER OR ONE THE OTHERS- SO I SAW THE MAP WHERE THEY WERE COUNTING. THE TIMBER HARVEST TEACH PEATLANDS IN TREATED ACRES- AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT- TO MY KNOWLEDGE DON'T COST US ANYTHING THEY'RE ACTUALLY. MONEY GENERATORS FROM BECAUSE THEY'RE PRIVATE PEOPLE DOING. FOR ST- MAINLY ON THEIR PRIVATE LANDS- SO CAN THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED IS THAT COUNTED IN THE EQUATION OR NOT BECAUSE IF IT IS A WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- DOING ACCOUNTING TO MAKE SURE HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING SPENT WHERE- AND I THINK IT'S JUST DUE TO THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW. HOW MUCH WE'RE ACTUALLY TREATING. OVER AND ABOVE. WHAT. IT WOULD NORMALLY BE TREATED UNDER T. H. P. YEAH SO OUR HIGH IN JUST CAN FILL IN AND- CORRECT BUT- SHORT OF IT IS THAT YEAH COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY THAT'S- YOU KNOW BASED ON ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT. IN THE FORRESTER ON LANDSCAPES DOES COUNT FOR. WORKFORCE OR LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT- AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE SAID YOU KNOW TAXPAYER FUNDED- INVESTMENTS ARE ARE ONE IMPORTANT SOURCE OF LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT BUT MARSHALL ACTIVITY. IS AS WELL. SO TODAY THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ACREAGE THAT WE FIND. AND I THINK WE COULD RECOGNIZE OUR THAT SECTOR IN ACTUALLY HELPING BUILD OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE- SO DIRECTLY INTO YOUR QUESTION I BELIEVE IT IS. JESSICA IN OUT OF THERE. HE MIGHT A LITTLE HISTORY- AND WHERE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE NUMBER COMES FROM THAT COMES FROM THE FOREST CARBON PLANTS. AND SO THE WHICH WAS A COLLABORATIVE REPORT DONE BY SCIENTISTS AND- AND EXPERTS. AYE IDENTIFYING WHAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF LAND OWNERSHIP WORST RECEIVED IS A HEALTHY FOREST YOU THE ESTIMATED THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY MILLION ACRES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE IN NEED AT THAT. OUT OF THE THIRTY MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION ACRES WERE NEEDED INTERVENTION. AND AND SO THE BASS LINE IN THAT TARGET A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. ASSUMES IT BUILDS INTO IT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- OF PRIVATE. WE IT TREATED LANDSCAPES- INCLUDING TIMBER HARVEST. I AND I AND THEN THE REMAINDER IS ON THE STATE AND WE'VE SEEN THE STATE PORTION AND- REALLY INCREASED DRAMATICALLY- AND THIS BUDGET WILL HELP US. REALLY DELIVER THOSE TARGETS PART OF THE REASON YOU HAVE. BOTH TIMBER HARVEST AND VEGETATION TREATMENT WITH AND IDENTIFIED BY THAT TARGET IN THE FOREST CARBON PLANT IS BECAUSE. THAT'S HOW THE FOR SERVICE DOES THEIR ACCOUNTING AS WELL- SO IT'S IT HELPS KEEP PARITY. UNDER AND COMPARE. WHAT GETTING TREATED AT WHERE- AND SO I CAN DO TO CHEAT ORDER TO MAY HAVE. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS ON THIS BEING OUR STATE FORESTER CAN BE ABLE TO OFFER SOME INSIGHTS INTO HOW THIS ALL WORKS. CHIEF THANK YOU JESSICA- STAND SENATOR DOLLY DOLLY FOR YOUR QUESTION WHAT I THE ONLY THING THAT I WANTED TO ADD IS THAT. COMMERCIAL TIMBER OPERATIONS ON PRIVATE LAND ARE NOT FUNDED IN ANY WAY BY ANY OF THESE DOLLARS. THAT IS WHOLLY SEPARATE HOWEVER AS US SECRETARY CHROMEBOOK MENTIONED THEY ARE APPROPRIATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS PLAN MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY AND TO THE FORCE PRACTICE RULES UNDER THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION AND- REGULATED BY US- AS THE INSPECTION AGENCY- WE DO INSURE THAT THOSE FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN I MEAN THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS MEET- THE FUEL REDUCTION. COMPONENT FOR THE AREA THAT THERE AND SO IT'S- AND ALL A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH BUT THAT IS WHERE PRIVATE INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE- ECONOMICS ARE ACTUALLY DRIVING SOME OF THE GOOD WORK IN THE FUEL REDUCTION AND FOREST RESILIENCE. SPACE I THANK YOU FOR THOSE THE QUESTION THAT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S A PROPERTIES% WELL I'M NOT I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU BUT I. DO WANT TO SAY THAT. WE TALK ABOUT. THE ROOM THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING SPENT IF YOU'RE COUNTING IF YOU CAN'T PUT IT ALL IN ONE POT THE ACREAGES IN ONE POT I SHOULD SAY. AND HALF OF THAT OR THREE THOUSAND ACRES THAT IS BEEN TREATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHICH IS GOOD. WE NEED TO DO THAT. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE SIDE THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY ON WHICH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THE COST PER ACRE GOES WAY UP BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. MY GOAL IS BUT- I'M NOT OPPOSED TO SPENDING THE MONEY I WILL I THINK PRIVATE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE HELPING OUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE AND WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. BUT WE NEED TO CATCH ACT WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OUT THERE. AND I THINK TO A MAN I KNOW THE PRIVATE SIDE. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT OF THE- IN IN MANY CASES NOT NOT IN SENATORS TURNS DISTRICT WHERE YOU HAVE CHAPARRAL AND THAT'S A 100% COST AND- AND I THINK. MISS MORRIS. STATED IT PERFECTLY THAT SOME ACRES ARE REALLY HIGH TO. TREAT AND SUMMER LOW- AND SO IT BUT THE BALANCE IS BUT WE- BUT ONE MORE COUNTY DOING ACCOUNTING. WE NEEDED DIVIDE OUT WHAT IT'S REALLY COSTS AND FOR THE PUBLIC- BECAUSE- A FEW YEARS AGO WE PASSED. A PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE THAT ALLOWED. CAL FIRE TO HELP. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. DO CONTROLLED BURNS. AND SO LAST FALL ACTUALLY WENT IN TO THE LOCAL CAL FIRE- OFFICE AND IN BEAVER. AND I'VE WANTED TO DO WANTED TO BURN BECAUSE WE HAD A WINDOW AND THAT YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK THAT I HAD TO GO THROUGH TO BE ABLE TO DO A BURN. IN THE TIME FRAME THAT I NEEDED TO DO IT AS HORRENDOUS FOR A SMALL. THE LANDOWNER AS MYSELF AND SO WHAT WHY SAY THAT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ABILITY BE ABLE TO HELP THE- THE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO DON'T HAVE A COMMODITY. THAT ACTUALLY OFFSET THE COST AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO STREAMLINE THE REGULATORY PROCESSES FOR THOSE LANDOWNERS THEY CAN'T THAT THAT ARE TRYING TO DO A T. H. P. TO DO THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO- AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DRIVE THE COST DOWN AND TREAT MORE ACRES. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTION OR STANDS WHAT OF WHAT OCCURS WERE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IF YOU THROW MON OF THE SAME POT. SOME OF THOSE ACRES THE TAXPAYER. DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP TREAT THOSE ACRES AND SOME MAKERS THEY DID AND AMOUNTS AND THE COST. IS HUGE IT'S A IT'S A HIGH DOLLAR COMPARED TO WHAT- IT HAPPENED ON THE PRIVATE SIDE SO I JUST WANT TO DRAW THAT DISTINCTION I WANTED TO ADD ONE MORE THING MISTER JOURNAL BE QUIET- ON THE TRANSPORTATION I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR. REACHED OUT TO ME ABOUT THAT THE HELPING THE TRANSFERRED THE BIOMASS TRANSPORTATION AND I JUST WANT TO I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST WE'VE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO. TO- HELP. THE TRANSPORTATION COST OF BIOMASS WE CAN ACTUALLY GET IT TO A- RENEWABLE SOURCE- BUT HOW IT WORKS NEEDS TO BE. THE DETAILS OF HOW THAT WORKS- THERE WAS. BECAUSE I'M IN THE FORESTED AREAS AND I KNOW. THE CONTRACTORS IN THE PEOPLE THAT USE THESE PROGRAMS. THAT THE SYSTEM WAS GAINED AND I DON'T WANT THAT I WANT MORE ACRES TREATED. IS THE GOAL IF THE PUBLIC IS GONNA BE PUTTING RESOURCES IN IT I DON'T WANT THEIR ABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO BE. THAT IT. TO BE GAINED AND IT WAS SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE. FIRST OF ALL IN DIVORCE AFTER WEEK TALK IN BONE DRY TIMES WE DON'T TALK AND GREEN TOWN SO WHEN YOU HALL IN A LOAD TO A BIOMASS FACILITY. IT'S GOT SO MUCH MOISTURE IN IT THAN A LOT OF THAT IS THEY THEY DRY IT AND THEY- FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH THE WAY IT IS IN A BONE DRY TIME SO WE SHOULD BE TALKING IN BONE DRY TIMES NUMBER ONE. AND THE SUBSIDY SHOULD BE BASED ON MILES AWAY FROM THE PLANT. THE CLOSEST PLANT. BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS. CONTRACTORS FOR THE PLANTS. GET THE SUBSIDY. AND THERE ARE HAULING IT RIGHT BY ONE PLAN TO GO TO ANOTHER PLANT THAT'S FURTHER. WHICH MAKES IT WHICH DOESN'T DO THE PUBLIC ANY GOOD WORK TRYING TO GET BIOMASS TO THE PLANT. THE CLOSEST PLANTS WE CAN TREAT MORE ACRES WITH THAT. WITHOUT SUBSIDY SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO- HELP PUT LANGUAGE IN THERE AT SOME POINT THAT EXPLAINS LIKE A IT WAS OVER THIRTY MILES IT'S- SO MANY DOLLARS A BONE DRY TIENEN NEED TO GO TO THE PLANT AND THEY NEED TO BE THE ONES THAT. ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BACK. TO THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW THAT LOOKS SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE. I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA IF YOU IF YOU WERE ABLE TO PUT FIVE DOLLARS. A BONE DRY TIME. AT A HALF ME AS AS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS IT'S GONNA GET. COME OFF OF OUR FORCES LOT AWESOME- SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR. TALK TO ME ABOUT IT ON SATURDAY AND I JUST WANT TO SAY. THE WEEK WE CAN SET IT UP IN A GREAT WAY TO WHERE WE CAN GET MORE DONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR DOLLARS AND- I WANT TO THANK THE AGENCIES. AND THEIR STAFF- FOR BEANIE ON TODAY. I KNOW FINANCES LISTENING EVERYTHING WAS SAID. I WILL BE RIGHT ON IT- LET'S GO TO CENTER STERN. HIS HAS HAD HIS HAND UP AND- I HAVE. NOT NOTICED SAID ANIMAL GO TO SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANKS MISTER CHAIR- ME DROP MY HAND DOWN HERE OKAY GREAT YEAH MY COMING THROUGH OKAY. PERFECT ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU FIRST STEPPING UP YET AGAIN MISTER CHAIR- WATER NOW FIRE- NOT. NOT WAITING IN A CRISIS BUT LEADING I THINK THE SENATE'S BEEN REMARKABLY BOLD HERE AND INITIATING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND TAKING YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP CHARGE ANY BROUGHT OUT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET EARLIER THIS YEAR SO I JUST ON THE WHOLE I WANT TO APPLAUD YOUR WORK IN BEING AGGRESSIVE IN INITIATING HERE AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO- IN. INVOLVING OUR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE STRATEGY AND LOOKING SAID THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND BECAUSE OF THESE FIRES AND- AND REALLY DIGGING DEEP HERE SO I SENSE IN THE RHETORIC THE CATEGORIES THE WAY IT IS ALL STRUCTURED AS A REAL EVOLUTION IN OUR THINKING EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW NAMING A WHOLE CATEGORY RESILIENT WILDLANDS AND REALIZING THEIR OTHER WILDLANDS BESIDES FORESTS- DOWN TO NEED TO FOCUS ON ON PLANNING AND COMMUNITY HARDENING SO ON THE WHOLE I MEAN I'M- JUST. THRILLED THAT- WE'RE PUSHING THE CONVERSATION FORWARD HERE I WAS HOPING WHILE WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF L. A. L. HERE WE GET A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR WHY I'VE HAD. I'VE BEEN A BIT OF A- I HAVE- I WOULD NOT SENATE REQUIRES A BIT CRUNCHY OVERALL. FEW YEARS ON- ON ON SOME OF THE FUNDING. CYCLES AND HOW IT'S- REDID DIFFERENT FIRE RISK ZONES- SO I DON'T KNOW IF ELIO IS STILL ONLINE BUT- ONE OF DISTRICT I TWO TOPPINGS ON TOUCH SAID THE SORT OF FORCED HEALTH SPACE WRIT LARGE. AND THEN THE HARDENING SPACE- SO HISTORICALLY LMAO HAVE YOU GUYS ANALYZED- SO IT'S A ON FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION WHAT THE- THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN HAS BEEN FOR FUNDING HISTORICALLY. MISTER SINISTER BROWN. YEAH I CAN- JUMPING ELEVEN NINETY MY COLLEAGUE CAN ADD- ACTIVATED SMOKE THINK HE'S LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT HISTORICALLY THAN DAY NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE HAS HAS OFTEN HAD- MAYBE- HAD MORE THE FINDING IN SOME OF THESE AREAS THEN AND THEN THE SOUTH AND IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF STATE THERE'S MORE STUDENTS THAT TRADITIONAL FOREST PLANTED SOME OF THE POOREST HEALTH. FUNDS HAVE GONE I THINK- MORE TO THAT AREA BUT MY COLLEAGUE I BRAIN BROWN THE ALSO HAVE. HAVE SOME WORDS TO ADD AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- RYAN BROWN WITH THE L. A. L. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THAT. MS CHRISTINE POINT WE DID LOOK PARTICULARLY AT THE- CALIFORNIA- IS A FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE FORCE HEALTH PROGRAM. IN BOTH CASES WHAT WE LOOK AT WAYS. FOR ALL THE GRANT PROVIDED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH GPRS FINDING. VERY LARGE SHARE THE FUNDING AND I CAN PULL UP THE NUMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES INTERESTED. I'M SURE OF IT WENT TO USE CERTAIN REGION OF THE STATE PREDOMINANTLY THE SIERRA NEVADA REGIONS. NORTH COAST IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN A MUCH SMALLER SHARE OF A WIN TO. SOUTH OF THE TO HELP TAXIS- WE HAD SOME SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE RESOURCES AGENCY THEY CAN PROBABLY SPEAK. MORE TO IT I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY SEVERAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OVER TIME- THEY REPORTED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEY RECEIVE RELATIVELY FEWER APPLICATION FROM SOME OF THOSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THAT WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THAT AND TOO MUCH THAT THE AT- AND- IT MAY ALSO HAVE SOME. SOMETHING TO DO WITH SOME OF THAT FACTORS THAT- SUPPORTIVE PROGRAMS SOME OF THE CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO EVALUATE PROJECTS SO- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THOSE ARE GIGI R. F. FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE. FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR ON- IT WILL RELEASE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN EVALUATING THOSE PROGRAMS AND IN GRANT APPLICATIONS IS THE- THE CARBON BENEFITS AND THERE MAY BE CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS. ARE THERE MORE PREDOMINATELY IN SOME OF THOSE ARE LARGER TREE FOR CITY AREAS THAT- SCORE BETTER ON ON SOME OF THOSE CRITERIA. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M AND I. TO THE CHIEF AND THE SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND THEIR TEAMS AND- I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD NOTHING BUT WILLINGNESS AND- CREATIVITY ON THEIR PART TO TRY TO. SOLVE THAT- THE HISTORIC INEQUITY JUST. THE NUMBERS 3% OF TOTAL FUNDS FROM FOREST HEALTH HISTORICALLY OF GOING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND NINE PERCENT. OF FIRE PREVENTION HAVE OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAMS- BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S THEY'RE SORT OF THE LOCAL. THE LOCAL WILL QUESTION WHERE I KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN GRANTED TURN IN TURN DOWN OR OR OR A RETURN BUT THESE CRITERIA QUESTION- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A QUESTION IT'S- MAYBE MAYBE I'LL START WITH THAT AND- CAL FIRED G. PORTER YOU GOT. IF YOU GOT THE- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE WILLING- IN THE IN THE EARLY ACTION BUDGET ITEM THOUGH THAT WE PUSHED PUSHED OUT- ARE YOU GONNA BE RESTRAINED BY THE SAME KIND OF CRITERIA AND HAVE TO SCORE APPLICATIONS. AS RIGIDLY AS MR BROWN WAS REFERRING TO WEAR. IT'S SORT OF IT'S THAT CARBON METRIC OVER EVERYTHING ELSE AND THEREFORE A LOT OF THESE OTHER PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE. ON A PER ACRE BASIS THE SAME GHG AVOIDANCE POTENTIAL BUT A TON OF PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS FOR INSTANCE. DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY UNDER CURRENT LAW OR IN THE PAST ALLOCATION. TO IT TOO TO BE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE AS YOU SAID KIND OF IN THAT PROBLEM SOLVING MINOR OR IS THERE IS THERE NEED FOR FURTHER DIRECTION. THE SENATOR STERN GREAT QUESTION AND- I'M GONNA TURN TO OUR EXPERT IN THIS AREA THAT IS- ANGELA LOUDEST. ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE AND ENERGY. YOU CHIEF CORNER AND THANK YOU SENATOR SENT THE QUESTION I WE DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE FUNDING- BOTH THE G. G. R. I. FUNDING AND THE GENERAL FUND FUNDING SPECIFICALLY- WE CONSIDER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS- FOR PROJECTS. AS ONE OF JUST THIRTEEN CRITERIA IT HAS A BIT OF ADDITIONAL PREFERENCE OVER OTHER CRITERIA THAT WE USE FOR PROJECTS ELECTION ALTHOUGH WE DON'T- IT'S NOT ARE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IN THE WAY THAT IT FITS ECOLOGICAL GOALS IS THAT IT GETS MORE POINTS THAN ANY OTHER YOU THAT WE- ARE ABLE TO LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE FUNDING. THAT FORCED HEALTH- IS GIVEN IN THE EARLY ACTION PLAN WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK ACROSS ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT A PROJECT BRINGS TO THE PROGRAM- AND THEN TO SPEAK TO THE POINT ABOUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CALCULATIONS BUT YES WE DO HAVE EVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH- CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL. ARE AT WITH AN- THE WITH THE PROJECT WILL BE ON GENERAL. TO NOT NEED TO PRIORITIZE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT THAT THE CRITERIA HAVE NOT CHANGED SINCE WE'VE HAD THIS 3% AND 9% ALLOCATION BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT CHANGED THE SCORING CRITERIA WE HAVE- WE HAVE PUT AND WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR OWN STAFF AND WITH OUR PARTNERS TO- TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL TO DO MORE OUTREACH FOR. PROJECTS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND TO ENCOURAGE PROJECTS IN- NINE COMMERCIAL FOREST ECOSYSTEM TYPES SO- DON'T UNDERSTAND ENCOURAGEMENT POINT BUT MY POINT IS IF. YOU HAVE THE SAME CRITERIA BEFORE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ENCOURAGING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO APPLY. BUT YOUR CRITERIA ARE STILL WAITING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS A AT LEAST A CRITICAL METRIC IN THAT THEY'RE STILL NOT GOING TO. SCORSO AND NOW THEY WERE USING GENERAL FUND WHITE WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT METRIC AT ALL SENATOR I WANT TO JUMP IN HERE BECAUSE ALSO THE OTHER PIECE OF YOUR QUESTION IS RELATED TO THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS YES I SO I WANTED TO TOUCH ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND THEN ASK- CHEAPER LAND TO SPEAK AS WELL. BUT WITH THE WITH THE- THE COR CRITERIA HASN'T CHANGED- THE OUTRAGE IS THE KEY COMPONENT BECAUSE THERE ARE PROJECTS THERE ARE VIABLE PROJECTS IN PROJECT AREAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT JUST WEREN'T APPLYING BECAUSE OF THE WORD FOREST. AND SO I BASS WHERE THE DIFFERENCE AND NUANCES HERE WERE WERE WORKING WITH. THE LOCAL- FOLKS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR YOU AND ME AND THIS CONVERSATION IS SOUTH OF THE DASH OF BEES I UNDERSTAND THAT- THAT AREA- AS TRADITIONALLY LOOK AT THOSE GRANTS AS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY- WHERE WE'RE CHANGING THAT IN THE NARRATIVE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS BUT WE'RE ALSO- I WANT TO GIVE. A CHEAPER LAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRE PREVENTION SIDE OF THIS BECAUSE IT IS. A HUGE PIECE OF THE EQUATION AS WELL. THANK YOU BUT YOU A- THANK YOU ENSURE YOU OF THE COMMITTEE CHEN AFTER INTO RECTOR HELP. UP RIGHT OFF THE BAT- CENTER CEREMONY DRESS YOUR CONCERN FOR THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS- JUST AS- ENCHILADAS MENTIONED WE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS BUT ALSO THE WILDFIRE AVOIDANCE BUT TO YOUR COURT APPOINTED TO THE- FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS WE ARE SPECIFIC BUILD OUT IN VALUE WEIGHTING FACTORS THAT ARE WAITED HAD MUCH HEAVIER RELATED TO WILDFIRE THREATS. FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY- PROTECTION OF PEOPLE PROTECTION OF HOMES- WE TAKEN SOME OTHER FACTORS LIKE LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY VEGETATION TYPE. IS NOT A COMPONENT AND AT THE END OF THE DAY A WILDFIRE AVOIDANCE WHETHER YOU ARE IN A FORESTED AREA CHAPARRAL AREA OR ANY OTHER PARTY CALIFORNIA. WILDFIRE AVOIDANCE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF HOW WE EVALUATE OUR GRAND SO. TO YOUR POINT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR FOCUS REALLY IS ABOUT TRYING IN. OUR REGION DO MORE WORK TO GET GOOD QUALIFIED APPLICATIONS BECAUSE IT'S NOT A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE THAT IS PREVENTING US FROM GRANTING MORE PROJECTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'M HOPING THAT. WITH THE HELP OF YOUR STAFF- INDIANS WORK WE'VE DONE AND WORK WE BUT DONE WITH OTHER. OTHER ENTITIES ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT THIS YEAR WE WILL SEE MORE GOOD QUALITY APPLICATIONS DATA WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION. PROGRAM AND DANIEL YOU'VE BEEN YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING IN THIS HEARING YOU BEEN DOING THIS WORK BEHIND THE SCENES TO SO I REALLY WANT. TO APPLAUD YOU AND THE WHOLE TEAM FOR. MAKING YOURSELF OF. TO US. THE ISSUE I I'VE BEEN IS NOT THOUGH G. THAT- THEY DON'T QUITE THERE FOR IN THE PRO IS CALLED FOR. BUT ALL. BECAUSE RESTORATION PROJECTS WEREN'T. PREVIOUSLY ELIGIBLE EITHER IN THE IN THE AUDIT LEAST ON THE FOREST HEALTH THROUGH THE FIRE PREVENTION INSIDE SO THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU DID INVASIVE GRASS REMOVAL PROJECT. YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE IN SAN DIEGO OR RIVERSIDE OR YOU KNOW. LOS ANGELES. THAT THE FUNDS WEREN'T THERE TO DO THAT DID IT BACK IN PEACE SO IF YOU HAD THE GOATS COME THROUGH A CANYON AND DO THE CLEARANCE WELL THEY JUST DO NEW TO THE LANDSCAPE BUT THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING. ON THE BACK AND IN THE FINE THAT MAKES IT ELIGIBLE TO DO LIKE NATIVE. LANDSCAPE RESTORATION THERE AS WELL DO YOU HAVE THAT NOW CAN YOU DO SAY RESTORATION OR SAY LIKE THE ROADSIDE TREATMENT ISSUES ANOTHER HUGE ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE. YOU A LOT OF REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO RIGHT NOW THE MUSTARDS COMET RIGHT IT'S ALL ALONG THE ROAD SIDES. AND IT SPREADS THROUGH THE ROAD SIDES OFTEN BUT- WE'RE NOT- IT TYPICALLY HAS BEEN THE FOCUS BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN A GROUP YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A LOT OF ACREAGE OUT OF THAT PROJECT RIGHT YOU'RE GONNA GET A VERY SORT OF. NARROW BAND BUT A VERY HIGH HEAT YOU KNOW HI PREVENTION QUALITY. SO DO YOU HAVE. SORRY TO KEEP DRILLING FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN BUT DO YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO. ROAD SIDE TECHNICIAN AND THEN ALSO THAT THAT RESTORATION P. SO ESPECIALLY WHEN AREAS THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT EROSION THAT YOU CAN. YOU CAN KIND OF. DO BOTH ENDS OF THE PROJECT. THE MITIGATION THE TREATMENT. AND THEN ON THE BACK AND THE RESTORATION. THE SHADOW I I'D LIKE TO IN YOU ON ON THE SPECIFIC- WHAT WHAT WE HAVE- IS A PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES AND- THEY'RE REALLY GEARED TOWARD THAT FUEL REDUCTION AND- WILDFIRE AND LANDSCAPE RESILIENCE- AND THEN COMMUNITY PROTECTION. SO THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS- THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY IS BUT ALSO OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE THAT ARE C. D.'S ARE C. D.'S- AND- AND OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS- RUN THROUGH AGRICULTURE AND INTERIOR. THAT ALSO HAVE A SPACE YEAR- AND THEN RELATED TO ROAD SIDE SPECIFICALLY AND I HAVE A SPACE IN THAT RESTORATION PEACE AND YES WE CAN FIND SOME OF THAT- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON ON THE ACRES THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE EXPECTED TO DELIVER OVER TIME- WITH THAT OTHER PIECE AS AS- ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. ROADSIDE IT WE'RE WORKING WITH CALTRANS VERY SPECIFICALLY- WITH SOME OF THEIR- PLANNING EFFORTS AND- MINGLING ARE ARE PROGRAMS AND MAPPING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING COMPLEMENTARY WORK. ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE- BOTH ROADSIDE IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE- UPSLOPE OR DOWNSLOPE AREAS- TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND IS THAT THROUGH THIS FOREST HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT THAT CALTRANS PARTNERSHIP YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT YOUR YOUR MAIN TOOL THAT TO DO THAT MERGING IS THAT FOR SALE. THAT THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR YEARS ON BUT BUT NOW- WITH THE- FOREST AND FIRE RESILIENCE TASK FORCE FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE- WITH PATRICK RIGHT AT THE HELM- WE ARE EMBEDDED TOGETHER AND WORKING ON THE- THESE KIND OF ACT. NOT JUST CALTRANS AND HEALTHCARE BUT THOSE ARE TWO OF THE BIG- YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S ROAD SIDE THEN YOU THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I DON'T PUT A ROUND PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE HERE SO. IS FOR IS FORCED HEALTH. THE FINE THAT'S GONNA DO. THAT WORK OR IS IT OTHER FUNDS USING THE MIX IT'S A MIX OF MINES YEAH. I MEAN I WOULD SAY MOST PROBABLY LOOK POINT TAKE AND THAT. AS WE SHIFT. AND EMPHASIZED. THE REGIONALLY DRIVEN STRATEGIES WE NEED TO ASSESS OUR HISTORICAL PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE ACTUALLY THAT THEY PROVIDE RESOURCE AS AN EQUITABLE WAY ACROSS REGION. WE DIFFER IN OUR INTERPRETATION OF DATA YOU INSTEAD 329% WE THINK 25% OVER THE LIFE BUT WE TAKE AND- WE NEED IT WE NEED TO MODERNIZE. ADOPT OUR PROGRAM SO THAT THEY ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE GETTING ACROSS THE STATE SO SENATOR YOU KNOW WE FULLY EXPECT. YOU TO HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE ON THAT I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW WE CAN REPORT BACK TO YOU ON THAT ON THE CHANGES THAT WE MAKE. I GET WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR WHICH IS OKAY YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A SUITE OF PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE. EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ACCESS BY YOUR LOCAL FOLKS DOWN THERE TO ACTUALLY. DO ALL THE TYPES OF WORK YOU NEED TO DO. SO THROUGH THAT FOR THROUGH OUR WORK IN THE- WILL WILL ENSURE THAT HAPPENS AND THEN WE CAN CIRCLE BACK AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW THAT'S CHANGED. THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT'S GETTING ACROSS THE STATE NO MORE I GOT AWAY. WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY. IT'S NOT EVEN THAT I'M- MY END RESULT MIGHT MY DREAMS THERE IS NOT THAT YOU KNOW THE EVERY COUNTY GETS THE SAME EXACT PERCENTAGE OR THAT YOU KNOW MY BACKYARD GETS. YOU KNOW EXT PERCENT IN RIVERSIDE GET 6% THE METRICS DRIVING THIS I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE OUGHT TO BE. CLICK SAFETY RISK THAT THAT RISK TO LIFE AND PROPERTY AND I KNOW WE BACKED INTO THE GOALS OUT OF A CARBON FROM CARBON PLACE ORIGINALLY IS AS YOU JERRY SECRETARY PUT IT SO IT'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE YOU GUYS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO YOUR WORK THIS IS SUPER HELPFUL FEEDBACK THOUGH AND- AND I APPRECIATED. AND I JUST I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALSO I DON'T WANT TO UNDER CUTS THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE GOLD I DON'T WANT TO UNDERCUT THE MO YOU WE WANT YOU TO GO I WANT YOU TO DO THAT WORK RIGHT LIKE I I'M BODY IN ON BACK TO YOUR PROJECT I THERE'S A STANFORD STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT LAST MONTH. THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE SORT OF ACREAGE BASE GOALS ON LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT THAT WE NEED TO GO FASTER FURTHER YOU KNOW AND WE WANT TO PUSH YOU TO BE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO COUNT WE WANT TO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE LET'S TRY TO KNOCK OUT YOU KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR OR TRY TO GET ABOUT HALF A MILLION. I JUST BE WHAT THE STANFORD STUDY POINTED OUT- IS THAT THAT THAT FUNDING BACK PIECE IS ONLY GONNA SOLVE ONE ELEMENT SO BUT MY SECOND QUESTION WAS REALLY ON THAT HARDENING SIDE IF YOU START FROM MEANS IGNITION AT THE HOME. AND SORT OF WORKED BACKWARDS ALL THE WAY TO THE FOREST VANCE WE'VE GOT. A CO EQUAL KIND OF EMPHASIS HERE- WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN TRYING TO JUST YOU KNOW AGITATE ON THIS POINT EVEN IN OUR SENATE PLAN HERE- I THINK WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW 3% OF FUNDING TO HARDENING TOM HARDEN. I DID A STANFORD STUDY RECOMMENDS A THIRD OF THE FUNDING GO TO HARDENING. SPECIFICALLY IN THE HOME AND NOT NECESSARILY ALL PUBLIC DOLLARS BUT SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW MATCH DEFICIT SO WE'VE GOT SUCH A BIG EMPHASIS ON THE LANDSCAPE SIDE BUT ON THE HEARTENING SIGHT I KNOW WE PUT OUT THE INITIAL TWENTY FIVE. AND YOU GUYS CAN TRY TO SCALE THAT HOPEFULLY WOULD FEED OUR PARTNERS. IS BEING MADE TO MAKE IT A HUNDRED BILLION. YEAH UPDATES FOR US THERE ARE WHAT WE EXPECT. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN IS GO AND YOU DON'T- COMMIT BUNCH OF MY- RIGHT UP FOR BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY WORKS. AD NOTING DUES PRIVATE ENGAGEMENT TO WIN THAT. BERMAN INSURANCE IS OBVIOUSLY HUGE FACTOR HERE TO AND DRIVING SOME OF THAT. THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU KNOW ENGAGEMENT I'M NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE WANT. SUBSIDIES TO MALIBU HOMEOWNERS TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES WHEN YOU KNOW THEY'RE SITTING ON A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE AND WE NEED THAT HARD. IT'S MORE LIKE THE PEOPLE IN CHATSWORTH LIKE MANNER ON FIXED INCOME IT'LL TWO BEDROOM IN THE WILL WE OR OTHER FOLKS IN LAKE COUNTY YOU'RE- AN OPEN BEAVER WHEREVER ELSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. I WE TALKED LAST TIME THAT. THE ESTIMATE WAS THAT YOU GET TWELVE THOUSANDS I THINK HOMES INSPECTED. OR MAYBE WAS HOMES HARDENED OUT OF THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION SKILLED ONE HUNDRED. CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE UPDATE ON. WHERE THINGS LOOKING LIKE IN THE HARDENING WORLD WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT TO SEE IN. YOU KNOW IN MY FANTASY WORLD I WANT CO EQUAL ALLEN HARDENING UP AGAINSTLANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT IS A BILLION AND A BILLION NOW WE'RE- YOU KNOW THIRTY MILLION IN A. BILLION WE GOT A WAYS TO GO BUT- WE TALKED A FOR THE CAN. ON THAT I'D BE REALLY HELPFUL FORMER WILL BE GOOD DON'T MISS CURSED HAD OR HOW. UP WITH HERE SO. IN SO EVERY. REALIZES THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE. BILLION FOR THE ENTIRE. EARLY BUDGET AND REGULAR BUDGET THIS IS FIFTY FIVE MILLION IF THIS PROPOSAL STATUS OF THE RICE YES TWICE AS MUCH. IT MAY NOT BE A PERCENTAGE BUT SECRETARY CRAWFORD DID YOU WANT TO TRY THAT. YEAH I MEAN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO RAMP UP OUR INVESTMENTS WITHIN COMMUNITY. AND INCLUDES HOME HARDENING. AND YOU'RE RIGHT SENATOR WERE WORKING THE LEVERS AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN PROPOSED INVESTMENT FOR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN BEAM UP ON WHICH WOULD BE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOT- JPA IS FORMING BETWEEN CAL FIRE AND- WE ASK THE MANAGE THESE. THAT THIS PILOT. FILE WOULD BE LOCATED IN TWO TO THREE- SPECIFIC AREAS CERTAINLY ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M SOME CONSTRAINTS DO YOU THINK FEDERAL FUNDING ON ON PRIVATELY OWNED HOMES THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WORKING THROUGH WHAT IS THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE NASCENT PUBLIC SUBSIDY FOR THIS WORK. RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW WE HAVE ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN HIGH HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES SO HOW DO YOU ACHIEVE SCALE. WE THINK THIS IS AN AMBITIOUS PILOT GIVEN ITS TALE OF A HUNDRED MILLION THAT IT'S GOING TO BE IN DIFFERENT PLACES THAT WILL WILL LEARN FROM. AND IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO ALLOW US TO OF ALL ABOUT THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN THE HOME HARDENING. I THINK YOU KNOW GONE IS THE DEBATE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE SPENDING MONEY IN COMMUNITIES OR HELPING. YOU KNOW EXPAND HOME HARDENING WE RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO DO THAT. WE JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST ROLE FOR- DOES THE STATE FUNDING. DOESN'T ANYTHING YOU'D ADD. MISS KIRSTEN DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING. OUR THIS IS ON THE- POINT- I JUST HAD MY- TO- TO MAKE SURE FOLKS WERE AWARE THERE IS ALSO. THAT WE IN THE- EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. BILL LANGUAGE. THAT WAS INTENDED TO GET IT SENATORS STERN'S CONCERN ABOUT THE REGIONAL AND INEQUITIES AND THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. AND SO THAT LANGUAGE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED HEALTHCARE TO PRIORITIZE AND PROJECTS THAT PARTICULAR POPULATION AND LARGE NUMBER OF STRUCTURED. STRUCTURES REGARDLESS OF VEGETATION TYPE. I MEAN HE'S USING OUTRAGE AND THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SO I JUST WANTED TO. I'M JUST LIKE THAT FOR THE COMMITTEES TO THE COMMITTEES AWARE AND- ALERT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR LISTENING TO OUR NEEDS. ARE AWARE THAT ON THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN SOME ACTION TO TRY THAT AND BRING SOME BALANCE TO THOSE PROGRAMS AS WELL. HI I HAVE TO MOVE US ALONG I HAD NO SENATE REQUIRE HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I THANK YOU CENTER. STERN AND THANK YOU. FOR THIS PURPOSE. I DO I WAS STILL I'M SORRY TO I DIDN'T GET ANSWER HOW MANY HOMES THEY PLAN TO HARDEN THE FUNDING. JUST WEST HOPING TO GET THAT HOW MUCH WE MIGHT GET OUT OF THIS BUT WE CAN STILL LOOK THAT BACK YOU. CENTER STERN- OFFLINE OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'LL BE AT. WE CARE SO FIRST AND FOREMOST JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU TO- THE SENATE BUDGET TEAM FOR WORKING THIS ISSUE TO THE VICE CHAIR CENTER STERN FURTHER FOCUS ON THIS LANDMARK INVESTMENT FIVE BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS- THIS IS WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS THIS IS WHAT CALIFORNIA IS GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMBAT THE REALITY THAT WERE IN. A AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND DECADES I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS AN EARLY INVESTMENT MEANING I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO MORE. THE MORE WE SPEND EARLY THE LAST WERE GONNA SPEND LONGER TERM BOTH ON THE DESTRUCTION THAT WE SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS- WILDLING. END S. SECRETARY CROWFOOT NOTED NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS DEEPLY ENGAGED WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS BUT WE NEED ABOUT TWO TO THREE BILLION EVERY YEAR MOVING INTO OUR FOREST LANDS AND WILDLANDS AT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DENT IN THIS MASSIVE PROBLEM THAT ALL OF US ARE FACING- IN THAT MAY MEAN ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ON THE TABLE FROM THE STATE. BUT ABSOLUTELY I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY FOCUSED ON IS ENSURING THAT OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME. AGAIN THOUGH- WILL SAY CANDIDLY DATE. THE FIVE BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS. RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME. JUST AT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION GUARANTEE FOR THE WILD AND RESILIENCY IT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE SHOT IN THE ARM. FOR THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS LET ALONE THE COMMUNITY HARD THE FIRE BREAKS. AND WHAT I'M ALSO GRATEFUL FOR MISTER CHAIR IS YOUR FOCUS ON THE FOREST AND WATERSHED RESTORATION. THE CHAIR AND I WERE TALKING JUST YESTERDAY ABOUT. THESE LANDS WE USED THE MENACING NATIONAL FOREST AS EXAMPLE THEIR NEWT. I AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THE SAME FORCE CONDITIONS IN THAT FORCE FIRST CENTURY. BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATION AND HOW HOT THAT FIRE BURNED. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT WATERSHED AND FOREST RESTORATION I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT MORE INTO THAT. HERE IN THE COMING YEARS QUICKLY. CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS I JUST WANT TO MENTION GREATLY APPRECIATE THE TWELVE HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS ARE MOVING FORWARD- IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT THE STATISTICS SHOW US THAT WE HAVE TO GO FURTHER. OVER THE LAST DECADE WERE DOWN FORTY TWO HUNDRED HAND CREWS FROM CDCR. INMATE HAND CREWS FORTY TWO HUNDRED- AS OF ABOUT SIXTY DAYS AGO WE HAVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED TWENTY SIX TOTAL INMATES IN THE SYSTEM. NOR ADDING TWELVE HUNDRED AYE SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS THIS YEAR IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH A DECADE AGO WE DIDN'T SEE THE DEATH THE DESTRUCTION THE SIZE AND THE SCOPE- IN THAT HAS TO BE A CONTINUED FOCUS UNDERSTAND WHERE WE NEED TO GO UPSTREAM BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO COMBAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE RESPONDING TO FIRES. YOU KNOW THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS ORIGINALLY GONNA BRING FOR POTENTIALLY ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POSITIONS THIS YEAR FROM CAL FIRE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT. THIRD I AND I HAVE JUST ONE LAST POINT AFTER THIS IS CONTRACT COUNTIES SO CONTRA COUNTIES- AS WE KNOW- OVER THE LAST- GOSH ALMOST CENTURY. I HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FIRE COVERAGE IN THE COUNTIES THAT INCLUDE ORANGE LOS ANGELES VENTURA SANTA BARBARA MORAN IN KERN- THEY HAVE A FOCUS OF ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT TWO MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL HAND CREWS IN THOSE COUNTIES. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT AT THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME SPENT ON FIRE CREWS IN CONTRACT COUNTIES ARE ON S. ARE ALIENS- AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO BE WORKED OUT HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS- AND I KNOW THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS ALSO GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THAT- IN THE LAST PIECE OF THE SAY IS A LONGER TERM IN REGARDS THE BIO MASS TRANSPORTATION COSTS. IN MAKING THAT- THAT A MEGAWATT- WORK- THE COSTS MAKE UP FOR OUR WORK. IS GOING O BE THAT TRANSPORTATION COSTS NO THAT THAT TEN MILLIONS IN THERE BUT I THINK LONGER TERM ESPECIALLY TAKING OUT. THOSE DEAD AND DYING TREES AFTER THE FORCE WORKING NEED TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION IN THE COMING MONTHS. BUT AGAIN MISTER CHAIR NO B. S. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR pGRATEFUL I HAD TO MISS ROY AT REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK- TRULY. INTO THE PROTEINS OFFICE FOR THEIR DUE DILIGENCE ON THIS AND I KNOW THAT I SECRETARY CRAWFORD IS. BEEN ALL OVER THIS IN THE SECTOR THANK YOU TO YOUR TEAM AS WELL. TURNED BACK OVER TO MR. ANY COMMENTS FROM. THE CHIEF PORTER HAS CREW. OUR DAILY I WANT CENT REQUIRES REMARKS. WELL JUST SAVE MOST BROADLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE WE FOCUS ON RESILIENCE TODAY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN REALLY STRONG RESPONSE CAPACITY A CAL FIRE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THEM IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING FORCE IN THE WORLD SO- YOU KNOW IT ANOTHER TIME WE CAN GO INTO MORE IN DEPTH IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENTS. IN IN BUILDING THAT CAPACITY- BUT THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE IN THE ENTIRE- COMMITTEE FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP JUST IN EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF CAL FIRE WE'VE DONE YOU KNOW EXPANDED CALPERS RESPONSE ABOUT THE I DON'T OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO RECOGNIZED THAT CONTINUES TO BE CRITICAL. WE'RE REVIEWING THOSE APRIL LETTERS AS WE AS HIS HEARINGS GOING ON OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND THANK YOU EVERYBODY BUT IT WITH THE MINISTRATION FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING IN FOR INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT THE PARTICIPANT TOLL FREE NUMBER AND ACCESS CODE IS POSTED ON A COMMITTEE WEBSITE.

OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE IN ROOM THREE ONE NINE ONE. PLEASE COME FORWARD AND- TRUSTEE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN HERE TODAY ON BEHALF A NUMBER OF AGRICULTURAL CLIENTS THE FIRST ONE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE SENATE FOR PUTTING FORTH AN AGRICULTURAL FUNDING PROPOSAL- IT'S BEEN WELL THOUGHT OUT AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR IS IT AT HIS SEEKS TO ADDRESS LIKE TO MAKE JUST A COUPLE MINOR COMMENTS ON THAT PROPOSAL ITEM TWENTY THREE FIRST OF ALL FORMER FUNDING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR FORMER FANTASTIC AS YOU KNOW IT IS A GREAT PROGRAM INCENTIVE BASED PROGRAM THAT DELIVERS REAL RESULTS AND IS ACCOUNTABLE. WHEN IT COMES TO THE MONEY FOR AG BURN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT OF TWO NOTED THAT THE ONLY REASON WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT ISSUE HERE TODAY IN THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IS BECAUSE THE AIRPORT REJECTED THE PROPOSAL FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR DISTRICT FOR THEIR REDUCTION IN AG BURN ANY MONEY FOR THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON THE SAN JOAQUIN AIR DISTRICT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS IS COMING FROM AND IF WE MAKE THIS OPENED ALL AIR DISTRICT ONLY GONNA SLOW DOWN THAT PROCESS AND REALLY MAKE IT UNATTAINABLE FOR THE SAME WALKING A DISTRICT TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET OUT. ON METHANE DIGESTERS THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS THE REASON WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT METHANE DIGESTION THE REDUCTION OF METHANE IN DERRY IT DOES NOT HAVE A TECHNOLOGY PREFERENCE WHEN IT COMES TO THE REDUCTION OF METHANE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SHOULD BE SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEM TO DETERMINE WHICH TECHNOLOGY IS BEST USED TO REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND THEN FINALLY. HOW ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION WE DO SUPPORT THE PET DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IF STRUCTURAL DEFICIT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE DO NOT SUPPORT A TILT CURED MIDDLE SEGMENT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN JUSTIFIED AND THE BASIS FOR IT IS NOT WELL SUPPORTED WE ALSO DO NOT SUPPORT THE FULL PROPOSAL OF FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO CREATE STAFF POSITIONS- AND IT'S GOING TO CREATE A BURDEN ON THE INDUSTRY. WE THINK IT'S COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR THE SENATE TO CONSIDER FUNDING WITH GENERAL FUND AT THIS TIME- BECAUSE WE. DO HAVE THE GENERAL FUND TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN BUT WHEN THAT SENT WHEN GENERAL. GOES OUT. THAT WILL BE BORN BACK BY INDUSTRY. TO SUPPORT A PROGRAM WHICH WE DON'T BELIEVE HAS BEEN FULLY JUSTIFIED SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. S. MAKAYLA. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRIS MAKAYLA HERE ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES ON ISSUE TWENTY FOUR MISTER CHAIR WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND THAT OF THE SENATE ON WILDFIRE RESILIENCY IN THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE- WE DO SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION ALSO WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE'VE HAD WONDERFUL CONVESATIONS WITH SECRETARY CROWFOOT A CHIEF PORTER OF MISS MORRIS AND OTHERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND HOPE TO SEE THESE FUNDING PRIORITIES I WOULD LIKE TO NOT GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BUT SPECIFICALLY DO CALL OUT THE ONE MENTIONED BY SENATOR MCGUIRE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO GO BIZ FOR A TRANSPORTATION TO GET SOME OF THOSE FUELS OUT OF THOSE OUT OF THE FOREST. I ALSO AGREE WITH SENATOR OF MCGUIRE WHO SAID WE HAVE A LONG ROAD AHEAD. IF THE STATE AND THE FEDS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR COMBINED ONE MILLION AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE JUST SHY OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION ACRES IN THE STATE SO INDEED WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. THE OTHER POINT I'D LIKE TO RAISE WHICH WE DID WITH THE EARLY ACTION- EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. IS WE ALSO HOPE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POLICY CHANGES THAT ARE MADE. INCLUDING ON PRESCRIBED FIRE LIABILITY. HOPEFULLY A ONE PERSON IN CHARGE TO GO AFTER THOSE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- ON THE STATE SIDE. AMONG OTHERS SO WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT- MODERATOR WE WILL NOW OPEN THE PHONE LINES TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. LET ME CHECK TO SEE IF MEMBERS ARE IN TWENTY FORTY.

COLLUDING ORGANIC FARMERS WHO PRODUCE FOOD WITHOUT THE USE OF THESE TOXIC PESTICIDES- WE'VE ANALYZED IT PROPOSED TIERED FIT- FEE SCHEDULE AND WE'VE SEEN THAT MATERIALS IN THE LOWEST HERE WILL ONLY GO UP ONE HALF OF ONE CENT PER DOLLAR UNDER THE PROPOSED MIL FEE SCHEDULE. WE JOIN WITH PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN A TRANSITION AWAY FROM HARMFUL PESTICIDE USE INCLUDING RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WILL HELP FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS MANAGE PASSED SAFELY INCLUDING THROUGH ORGANIC METHODS. A DNA BARCODE LIBRARY AND EXPANDED PESTICIDE AIR MONITORING NETWORK IT'S ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE INVEST IN DIRECT PROTECTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES HARMED BY PESTICIDE USE AND URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO ADD A COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUND TO THE BUDGET TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AT GREATEST RISK OF HARM FROM PESTICIDE USE.

BUT WE FUNDED RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ORGANICALLY GROWN STARTS ARE AS HIGH QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVE AS THOSE GROWN CONVENTIONALLY. INVESTING IN PUBLICLY FUNDED ORGANIC RESEARCH AND EXTENSION THROUGH THE- REVENUES THAT BY THE END THROUGH FROM THE INCREASE MELFI CAN ACCELERATE PROGRESS IN THIS AREA AND MAKE ORGANIC STARTS MORE WIDELY. AND ECONOMICALLY AVAILABLE. A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPING ALL ALTERNATIVE PEST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IS NOT SUFFICIENT. AND WE SUPPORT IMPLEMENTING THE CHEERED ME MELFI SCHEDULED TO PROVIDE THE ONGOING RESEARCH AND EXTENSION NECESSARY TO EQUIP FARMERS TO DECREASE THEIR USE OF HIGHLY TOXIC PESTICIDES AND TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE EXPOSURE TO THESE MATERIALS.
