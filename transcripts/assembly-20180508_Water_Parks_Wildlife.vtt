SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE. FAT

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DISPIRITO REVIEW OF THE SEE IT

00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IS THE LARGEST LAKE IN TERMS OF

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:16.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SURFACE AREA IN THE STATE

00:49:16.653 --> 00:49:18.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXTREMELY SALINE BECAUSE IT HAS

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:21.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NO OUTLET. SO AS THE SALTY WATER

00:49:21.258 --> 00:49:22.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COMES IN FROM AGRICULTURAL

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:23.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RUNOFF IT HAS NOWHERE TO GO AND

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:25.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF AS IT EVAPORATES THE SALTS

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARE LEFT BEHIND. THE LAKE IS

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:28.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SHRINKING WHICH IS ONE OF THE

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:30.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ISSUES WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
M. IT BEEN PART BECAUSE IT HAS

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:34.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NO OUTLET AND IN PART BECAUSE OF

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:36.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT SOME WATER TRANSFER DEALS

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN PARTICULAR THE QUANTIFICATION

OTHER AREAS OF SOUTHERN

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CALIFORNIA REDUCING THE RUN OFF

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
INTO THE LAKE THAT HAS BEEN

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MITIGATION WATER BEING PROVIDED

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS BUT

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:51.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT OUT REQUIREMENT ENDED IN

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:53.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECEMBER SO THAT'S REALLY NOT

00:49:53.623 --> 00:49:54.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHANGING THE STATE OF THE LAKE

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
RAPIDLY NOW.

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AS THE LAKE SHRINKS DRY LAKE BED

00:49:58.895 --> 00:49:59.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS PLAYA IS

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:03.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
TALK ABOUT TODAY.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DOWN AT THE AT THE BOTTOM

00:50:06.002 --> 00:50:06.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BULLET YOU CAN SEE THE

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADMINISTRATION HAS ESTIMATED

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:09.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUNDRED ACRES OF PLAYA ANNUALLY

TEN YEARS IT VARIES YEAR BY YEAR

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:18.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT THAT'S THE AVERAGE ESTIMATE.

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:21.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO TURNING TO PAGE TWO.

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:24.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHY DOES THIS MATTER WHY IS THIS

00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:25.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

FUTURE I DROUGHT CONTINGENCY

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.959 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE
UNDERGOING.

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:02.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT IT'S GOING TO START NOW

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:03.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
SELF

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND ALL OF THIS FUNDING AND BOTH

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:07.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED AND

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEN SPENT IS PRIOR TO THE TEN

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
YEAR PLAN.

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND FOR EFFORTS NOT ASSOCIATED

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:15.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WITH THE TENURE PLAN.

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION OF

00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:19.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:20.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TEN YEAR PLAN AND THE PROJECTS

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THERE.

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO TURNING TO PAGE FIVE.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
M..

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:28.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE FIRST BULLET JUST ADDRESSES

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:29.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT FIGURE THAT FOR ABOUT FOUR

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:30.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION HAS BEEN

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AUTHORIZED THAT'S FAR. THE PLAN

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:34.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ESTABLISHES TENURE GOALS AND

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSOCIATED COSTS OF ROUGHLY FOUR

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HUNDRED MILLION SEPARATE AGAIN

00:55:37.667 --> 00:55:39.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

TABLE HERE.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO HOW WE GONNA PAY FOR THAT

00:55:41.838 --> 00:55:42.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WELL

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

BONTA THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN

ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
IF VOTERS APPROVE FAT.

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:22.378 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:40.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SONGS. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:46.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT A LONG RANGE PLAN FOR THE

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOLVENCY. THOSE TWO DON'T GO

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:47.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TOGETHER VERY WELL IMMEDIATE

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:48.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ACTION ON LONG RANGE PLAN.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:51.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOLELY BIFURCATED THE PROCESS.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
AND TO TO.

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SEGMENTS ONE AS OF THE TEN YEAR

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PLAN.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE. WATER

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
POURED.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALONG WITH A STIPULATED ORDER

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:03.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND THE OTHER IS A LONG RANGE

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:06.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PLAN THAT WE ARE WORKING ON NOW.

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WILL ENCOMPASS THE ENTIRE

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
CITY AND WILL LOOK AT.

01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:14.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE THINGS LIKE WATER IMPORT ON

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:15.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
NEXT WEEK.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WEEK AFTER NEXT.

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
A WERE HAD WE HAVE A PUBLIC

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:21.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MEETING WITH THE. IMPERIAL

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:23.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
COUNTY ON THOSE.

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WATER IMPORT PROJECTS.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE GOAL OF THAT IS TRYING

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:29.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO DEFINE SOME THAT ARE. DIDN'T

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:32.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
MAKE THEM.

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:33.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH FIT THE CRITERIA WE HAVE

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:34.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
FOR.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:36.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
COST.

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I IMPLEMENT HOW FAST WE CAN

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IMPLEMENT THEM.

01:17:39.888 --> 01:17:41.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:44.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOCUMENTATION Y. NATICK SACHA?

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:48.296 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
SO THAT WILL START THE REVIEW
OF.

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:50.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE LONG RANGE PLAN THAT DOESN'T

01:17:50.098 --> 01:17:52.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MEAN THE LONG RANGE PLAN WILL BE

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:53.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
A WATER IMPORT PLAN. QUITE

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:56.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FRANKLY. RIGHT NOW IT'S DESIGNED

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS A SMALLER BUT SUSTAINABLE

01:17:58.306 --> 01:18:01.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
CITY PLAN. THAT HAS.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE. ACCOUNTS FOR THE. EXPOS

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PLAYA YOU SAW. TED TALK ABOUT

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL OF THAT EXPOSED FLY AROUND

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:10.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THE SOLVENCY.

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOW IT WILL BE BUILT SO THAT THE

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LONG RANGE PLAN IF IT'S WATER

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IMPORT. CAN STILL BE BUILT IN

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:18.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OTHER WORDS WILL BUILD THE.

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:21.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THE ARM.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE BURNS HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:23.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
CAN DO EITHER ONE.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:26.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COSTS A LITTLE MORE QUITE

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
FRANKLY.

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:30.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:31.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO ENGINEER BUT IT GIVES US THE

01:18:31.473 --> 01:18:34.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FLEXIBILITY WE NEED LATER.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
GIVEN THAT WE ARE.

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION A

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LONG RANGE PLAN TO THIS POINT.

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:42.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE OF THE OTHER COMMENTS WAS

01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:47.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EARLIER WAS FEDERAL FUNDING.

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:50.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND WE HAVE A MINOR AMOUNT OF

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
FEDERAL FUNDING.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:54.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE HAVE AN AMMO YOU SIGNED WITH

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:58.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
FOR.

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MAY NOT HAVE MADE THE OPERATION

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:02.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND MAINTENANCE OVER THE NEXT

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TEN YEARS FOR THIRTY MILLION

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
DOLLARS.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THREE MILLION A YEAR PLUS OR

01:19:06.508 --> 01:19:09.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MINUS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY MONEY

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:12.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FROM THAT AGREEMENT CHAIR.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:14.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW.

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EARLIER WAS ASKED WHAT COULD THE

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:19.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
STATE LEGISLATURE DO.

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ONE OF THE THINGS THE STATE

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:23.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HIS LOOSENING THE RULES AND

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
PROPOSITION MONIES.

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:28.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOW THESE ARE OF THIS IS A WISH

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:31.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LIST AND I DON'T KNOW HOW.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:33.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HOW OF WHETHER OR NOT?

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
THOSE SORT OF THINGS CAN BE
DONE.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IF YOU REALLY IF YOU RELAX

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THE RULES ON.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PROPOSITION MONEY YOU COULD

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:42.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TIME.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:44.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE WHICH

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:46.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE BECAUSE

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:49.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TO BUILD THIS.

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:53.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PUT OUT A PRETTY ROBUST

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:57.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPERATION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TOO ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A GROUP THAT'S WORKING CANONISTS

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:05.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:09.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HA SCAT IS LEAVING US.

01:20:09.137 --> 01:20:10.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND LOTS WE GET THE LOCKS

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGED ON THE DOOR BEFORE HE

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:14.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN TURN BEFORE IT GETS THERE.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:15.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:18.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WE HAVE M. PROCESS.

01:20:18.713 --> 01:20:20.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO IDENTIFY A NEW REPLACEMENT

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:23.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SCAT HAS PROMISED TO HELP UNTIL

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:26.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT REPLACEMENT COMES ON BOARD.

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OH THERE WAS A LOT ACCOMPLISHED

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:31.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
AT THE DFW OFFICES.

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE LIKE THE TIME SCOUT WAS

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:34.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:36.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AND HABITAT.

01:20:36.164 --> 01:20:37.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND DONE PERMITTING AND OTHER

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:40.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WE ARE UNKNOWN.

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERY GRATEFUL CATTLEYA FOR HIS

01:20:43.805 --> 01:20:45.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
EFFORTS.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A TED IS IS BEEN WORKING ON THIS

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:49.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROJECT LONGER THAN I HAVE I

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:51.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:53.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A AND HAD HIS GROUP HAS PROVIDED

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:56.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORTER.

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:57.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND CONTINUES THROUGH PROVIDE

01:20:57.786 --> 01:21:00.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT. THEY

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:02.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE ONE PERSON CHARTER. ALSO BUT

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
FILLING THAT POSITION.

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO LET'S SAY WITHIN THREE TO SIX

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:11.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MONTHS THOSE POSITIONS WILL

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
LOBBY FILLED.

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M WILL HAVE A FULL CONTINGENCY

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OF PEOPLE.

01:21:16.271 --> 01:21:18.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
NOW AS WE GET.

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:21.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS WE START TO RAMP THIS UP.

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:22.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY'RE PROBABLY THEY'RE NOT

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:24.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROBABLY THERE WILL BE MORE THAN

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONE PROJECT GOING AT THE SAME

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TIME.

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:30.285 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
LEADER FROM A DESIGN
PERSPECTIVE.

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:31.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OR A DESIGN AND BUILD

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PERSPECTIVE OR BOTH.

01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE PROBABLY WILL NEED MORE

TO FINISH THE EASEMENT ISSUE.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:15.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONCE WE FINISH THESE MINUTES TO

PROJECT WILL USE THAT AS A.

01:24:23.591 --> 01:24:25.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMPLE FOR THE OTHER. HE IS A

BUT THEY'LL THEY'LL BE A.

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:33.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING OZZY'S

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:34.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND PARTICULARLY WITH DESIGN

SOME KIND OF.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:43.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
PHASED APPROACH TO E. IS

WE LOOK AT AT A YOUNG DESIGNED

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL ALLOWS YOU TO GET STARTED

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:51.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EARLIER BUT IT DOES LOOK. IT

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOES REQUIRE ENGINEERING TO DO

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:54.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:57.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO WE'LL LOOK AT HOW BEST.

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE. INTEGRATE THAT INTO THE

FEW MONTHS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:11.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FILL THOSE. ROLES THAT IN ITSELF

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:12.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CREATES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:13.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONCERN AS IT RELATES TO THE

NOT I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. BUT

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:30.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO ASK THAT

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:31.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE REALLY GIVE US SOME REALLY

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
POINTED ANSWERS

TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:37.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BY GOTTEN HERE BEFORE. OF MYSELF

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:37.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE SOME

01:27:39.053 --> 01:27:40.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTIONS AS WELL. SO I GUESS

01:27:41.055 --> 01:27:42.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE FIRST THING IS HOW ARE WE

01:27:42.156 --> 01:27:44.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOING TO TRY TO MAKE UP FOR THEM

01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:47.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A. TIMEFRAME THAT'S BEEN SET UP

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THAT THE STATE WATER

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS SAID

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:52.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME SOME BENCHMARKS FOR US TO

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:55.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOME TOOLS THAT DESIGN BUILD

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:58.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
COMPONENT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH
UP.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A AND WHEN WILL WE SEE THE FIRST

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
A CONSTRUCTION I KNOW YOU

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:04.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MENTIONED THE MAYBE AT THE END

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF THE YEAR BUT IS THERE

01:28:05.179 --> 01:28:06.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO. TO

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXPEDITE SOME OF THAT PROCESS IN

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:10.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE AISLE THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:12.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.955 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
A JUMP RIGHT IN A PICK THE
FIRST.

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WE WILL START CONCERT

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
BY.

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HIS BIGGEST TO THE MICROPHONE

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:21.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIRST PLAY WILL ALSO WON'T WE

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WILL START CONSTRUCTION BY

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DECEMBER.

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:27.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHO THE WATER ORDER DOES GIVE

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:29.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
US A SECOND YEAR? TO HIT CAUGHT

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UP INTO SUPERIOR THE FIRST YEAR

01:28:31.305 --> 01:28:33.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO. WOULD BE HARD TO KEEP UP

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BECAUSE.

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT TO

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO BUILD THE

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROJECT. ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BILL

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:42.350 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THEATER NINE HUNDRED ACRES.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT UNTIL YOU GET A BILL THAT

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THE.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:48.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A TOTAL SO WE HAVE TWO YEARS.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:52.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOW OF DEVELOPING. WERE REQUIRED

TO DEVELOP.

01:28:54.128 --> 01:28:56.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A PLAN FOR TO GET CAUGHT UP.

YOU SAW OF THE WHAT.

01:28:59.267 --> 01:29:00.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TED CALLED THE ALCOTT ROAD

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROJECT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ANSWERS TO.

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:06.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW DO WE SPEED UP AND HOW DO WE

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MOVE THIS FORWARD?

ARM.

01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:12.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I THINK THEY'RE FROM FROM THE

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:16.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
POINT OF VIEW OF.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:18.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE LEGISLATURE YOU FOLKS

01:29:18.086 --> 01:29:20.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE.

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
AND PROVIDING.

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FUNDING AND HABITAT.

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:28.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:31.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:32.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LEGISLATURE AT THIS POINT.

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:35.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:38.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK HEARINGS LIKE THIS HELP

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:40.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BECAUSE THEY DO PUT US ON.

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTICE THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:44.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:46.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK INVOLVING OUR PARTNERS

01:29:46.314 --> 01:29:47.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN THE HEARING IS IS ALSO A

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:48.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
GREAT IDEA.

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
MOVING FORWARD.

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.487 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
<u>&lt;c.red&gt; SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS</u>
<u>EARLIER&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:29:52.553 --> 01:29:54.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I IDEA IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO.

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:56.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWO LINES HAS BEEN VERY VERY

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:58.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
HELPFUL.

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:01.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
YEAH AND MOVING.

01:30:01.162 --> 01:30:03.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF AN S. C. H. NSCA JUST SORT OF

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:06.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CORNERSTONE. OF THE PROJECTS

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MOVING FORWARD SO. THAT'S THE

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:09.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PROJECT TO GET STARTED IN

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:11.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DECEMBER.

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:13.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THAT'S OUR FIRST PROJECT.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:14.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN WE MOVED TO THE OTHER

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:16.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SIDE OF THEM SLIMMY ASK A

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:19.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE AB.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:20.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DELAYED ALREADY WITH THE

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROJECT OR

01:30:21.949 --> 01:30:23.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THAT PROJECT.

01:30:23.785 --> 01:30:26.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOES THAT AUTOMATICALLY DELAY US

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:27.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM MOVING FORWARD WITH OTHER

01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:28.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECTS THAT ARE WITHIN THE.

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

WETLAND.

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:03.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS BEING DEVELOPED. RIGHT NOW

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:05.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WHILE WE'RE STILL WORKING

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THROUGH THESE MENDACIOUS NOW ALL

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.864 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
OF THOSE HAVE THESE MONEY
ISSUES.

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:11.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT ONCE WE GET ONE WORKED OUT I

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THINK WE CAN.

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WORKOUT THE OTHERS FASTER

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:16.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THERE'S ALSO A.

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NORTH IN PROJECT WITH TORRES

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
MARTINEZ.

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT HANNAH HAD ACTUALLY HAS THE

01:31:22.009 --> 01:31:23.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BENEFIT OF NOT HAVING QUITE AS

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
MANY.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REGULATIONS ATTACHED TO IT.

01:31:27.215 --> 01:31:30.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH.

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:32.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I GETTING HOME PAYS RENTS FOR

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT SO THAT WE CAN.

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE CAN EXTEND TENURE TO BUILD

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:39.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HARD TO BUILD THINGS WHILE WE'RE

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:41.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WAITING TO FINIAL FINALIZE.

01:31:42.063 --> 01:31:43.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOME OF THE ISSUES ON THE LARGER

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:46.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
SCALE PROJECTS.

01:31:46.667 --> 01:31:48.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OKAY I WANTED TO. ASK THE

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:49.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:50.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EASEMENTS BECAUSE YOU'VE

01:31:50.571 --> 01:31:51.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MENTIONED THAT A COUPLE TIMES

01:31:51.906 --> 01:31:53.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I THINK ON THE GROUND. IT'S

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:54.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
BEEN.

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SAID THAT THERE'S IT'S BEEN

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
DIFFICULT.

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:59.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE OTHER PARTNERS ARE AGENCIES

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INVOLVED IN THIS CAN YOU TELL US

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT HAS BEEN THE CHALLENGE. AND

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:06.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WHAT IT IS THAT.

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WEEKEND SET UP IN PLACE TO TRY

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO AVOID OR ELIMINATE THESE

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
TYPES OF.

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:15.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LONG LASTING NO NEGOTIATIONS ARE

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:17.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
DELAYING.

01:32:17.431 --> 01:32:18.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:19.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROJECT.

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:21.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BIGGEST DELAY HAS BEEN A

01:32:22.036 --> 01:32:24.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ESTABLISHING LIABILITY.

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR THE EXISTING PLY AND NOT THE

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROJECTS.

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:30.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND OBVIOUSLY IDEA WOULD LIKE.

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT LIABILITY COVERAGE AN

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:34.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
OBVIOUSLY. WERE NOT TOO

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:35.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GIVING WE

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DON'T MIND. GIVING IT ON THE

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECTS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT.

01:32:39.153 --> 01:32:41.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TOUGHER FOR US TO GIVE US.

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:43.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I ABILITY UNDER EXISTING.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLAIMS OUT THERE ARE EXISTING

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBLEMS OUT THERE. SO ONE OF

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:47.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
DO.

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HERE'S PASSED SOME KIND OF

01:32:50.631 --> 01:32:51.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
LIMITATION.

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:54.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
OUR TIME.

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:58.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE TAKE TOOK THAT LIABILITY

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ISSUE AWAY.

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DOES THE LIABILITY THAT THE

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

BACK AND FORTH WITH AYE ID WOULD

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:13.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
BE REALLY.

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:15.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

PROJECT THAT DOES.

01:33:17.925 --> 01:33:20.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RELATED TO EXISTING CONDITIONS

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:21.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THAT THE SOUND CITY.

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:22.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUR ATTORNEYS BELIEVE IT DOES

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:24.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOT.

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:27.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THAT'S THE CERCLA CONCERNS.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
ON APPLY OF PREVIOUS.

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:36.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:33:37.044 --> 01:33:38.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I MEAN IT MAYBE I MAYBE BECAUSE

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:39.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY I AM I

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:42.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
MISSING THE THE.

01:33:42.116 --> 01:33:44.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POINT THERE. BUT THE END IN THE

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:45.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BIG PICTURE I MEAN WE HAVE A

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HUGE LIABILITY OUT THERE. THAT

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:49.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ULTIMATELY FALLS ON THE SIDE OF

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:51.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE AND IF WERE GOING BACK

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND FORTH ON THIS TYPE OF UP.

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:56.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DETAILED MAY BE OF SIGNIFICANCE.

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:57.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I MAYBE IT'S NOT REGISTERING

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH ME I THINK WE'RE PUTTING.

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT RISK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:03.371 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
LIABILITY THAT WE HAVE OUT
THERE.

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:06.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF HAVING IT

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:07.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NEGOTIATED A NEEDS MET RIGHT

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AWAY AND. MAYBE I'M MISSING

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:10.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE I THINK

01:34:10.911 --> 01:34:12.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL I I DON'T I THINK I DID A

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:13.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BAD JOB OF EXPLAINING.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:17.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:19.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REQUIREMENTS FOR OF THE STATE.

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:22.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHEN IT COMES THE LIABILITY.

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:24.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THOSE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE WAS GETTING IN THE WAY.

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:30.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO IS THAT AN AREA THAT WE.

01:34:30.297 --> 01:34:31.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT BECAUSE

01:34:32.033 --> 01:34:33.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AS YOU JUST MENTIONED ONCE WE

01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:35.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GET THIS ONE EASEMENT ISSUE.

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:37.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
IN PLACE.

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:38.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WILL SEPARATE STUDENT

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOVING FORWARD ARE WE GONNA HAVE

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO DEAL WITH THIS PROJECT BY

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:43.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROJECT.

01:34:43.277 --> 01:34:44.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS WE GO THROUGH THE MANAGEMENT

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
PLAN.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'LL SET PRECEDENT MOVING

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORWARD NOW HAVING SAID THAT.

01:34:49.617 --> 01:34:51.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EACH PROJECT WILL HAVE A

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:53.287 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NEW I'M
STILL.

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUT THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY.

01:34:55.790 --> 01:35:00.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WELL HAVE BEEN DEALT.

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:03.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT'S THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:04.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:07.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LIKE WHO WHO GETS TO MOVE ON TO

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:08.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AND HOW DO

01:35:08.269 --> 01:35:10.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE ACTUALLY. SET SOME BENCHMARKS

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:11.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE ABLE TO MEET SOME OF THESE

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CALLS AND SAY WE'VE GOT TWENTY

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIVE DAYS THIRTY DAYS TO FIGURE

01:35:14.675 --> 01:35:15.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS OUT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:17.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.

01:35:17.411 --> 01:35:18.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHALLENGE BEFORE IS WHAT WHAT IS

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:20.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT SYSTEM LOOK LIKE.

LIMITED TO A COUPLE PEOPLE.

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I HAD AYE ID'S REQUEST AND AND I

01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:32.293 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
REQUEST MAKES MORE SENSE TO

THE DESIGN BUILD PROCESS

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE IS IS I

THAT COMFORT BELT THAT A BETWEEN

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PARTNERSHIPS I THINK IS GONNA GO

ON WAYS.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:25.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
WE MIGHT LOOK AT.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:26.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WAYS THAT WE CAN SHORTEN OUR

01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:27.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
STREAMLINE.

01:38:28.002 --> 01:38:29.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BIDDING PROCESS WE DO HAVE

01:38:29.136 --> 01:38:30.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SOME GETTING.

01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:32.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INVOLVED IN THIS AND WE DON'T

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:34.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WANT TO GIVE UP THE. OPTION FOR

01:38:34.808 --> 01:38:37.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BED OVER DESIGN.

01:38:37.144 --> 01:38:38.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BILL WHAT'S PREVENTING US FROM

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:39.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
DOING THAT.

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
NOTHING.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE JUST THINK THAT DESIGN BUILD

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:43.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THIS FASTER.

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:47.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUT LET'S SAY SOMETHING.

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:50.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:53.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
CAUSES.

01:38:53.227 --> 01:38:56.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
HOUSE TO.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAUSES US TO HAVE A DELAY IN THE

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:01.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
DESIGN BUILD PROCESS.

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW WE COULD FALL BACK AND THE

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:06.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DESIGN SAID FILLED PROCESS?

01:39:06.307 --> 01:39:09.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND IF WE HAD SOME TIME.

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:12.279 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
SOME ABILITY TO SHORTEN THE
TIME.

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOW THE ADVERTISEMENT IT WOULD

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:16.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
BE HELPFUL?

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:16.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:19.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOOKING AT DOING NOW HOURS AT UP

01:39:19.553 --> 01:39:20.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO WERE WAITING I THINK WE

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:22.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
SHOULD.

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:24.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DO YOU NEED DIRECTION FROM.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:26.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOMEONE ELSE DO YOU NEED DAHLE

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OUR INSISTENCE AND PUSHING THAT

01:39:27.728 --> 01:39:29.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD IT REQUIRED

01:39:29.663 --> 01:39:30.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TO MOVE.

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THAT DIRECTION IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL HELP US.

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:41.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SHORTEN THE TIMEFRAME.

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WILL LOOK TO SEE IF IT

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:51.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
MYERS WELL.

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:53.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
USE IT TAKE QUESTIONS COLLEAGUE.

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:56.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND I APOLOGIZE I JUST WALKED IN

01:39:56.323 --> 01:39:58.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE.

01:39:58.158 --> 01:39:59.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I JUST IN THE BRIEF TIME THAT

ARE HERE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:02.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

TO MOVE THIS ALONG. IT QUITE

01:40:12.339 --> 01:40:12.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FRANKLY I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
JUST.

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:15.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
KIND OF WEIRD SITTING URGES.

01:40:15.909 --> 01:40:17.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVING CONVERSATION INSTEAD OF

01:40:17.311 --> 01:40:18.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLY ANY KIND OF RESULTS I

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:19.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

SO WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOO FAR

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALONG AND THAT BUT THAT'S THE

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:19.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NEXT. THAT'S THE NEXT PRIORITY.

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:21.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I I DID OUTLINE A FEW THINGS

01:42:21.568 --> 01:42:24.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT THE. LEGISLATURE CAN DO

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:26.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
QUITE FRANKLY.

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
A LOT OF WHAT THE.

01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:30.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HOW WERE THE DELAYS ARE I DON'T

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:32.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
KNOW THAT IT'S OF?

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:33.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LEGISLATURE AND THESE ARE THE

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:36.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
LASER.

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECAUSE BY REVIEW PERIODS OR.

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:43.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SOME KIND OF.

01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:45.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF NEGOTIATION OF WHO WOULD I

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:47.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CAME TO THE.

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEGISLATURE SIX MONTHS AGO WITH

01:42:48.529 --> 01:42:50.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
THE.

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTAMINATION ISSUE WE MIGHT BE

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:54.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FURTHER ALONG WE DIDN'T THAT WAS

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
MY HAIR. WE SHOULD.

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:00.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARM BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK.

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:02.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEYOND WHAT I LISTENED ALREADY

01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:03.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THERE'S A SPLIT THERE'S A

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:07.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO.

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:09.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CERTAIN BUT MY CONCERN IS.

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:11.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AGAIN JUST IN THOUGH IN THAT

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:12.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONVERSATION EARLIER YOU STATED

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:12.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:15.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOUGH THAT THIS IT'S IMPORTANT

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:16.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR US HAVE THESE OVERSIGHT

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:17.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HEARINGS SO WE CAN BACK GET BACK

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:18.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ON TRACK THAT'S WHAT THREW ME

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:20.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OFF OF THE CONVERSATION IS. YEAH

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WELL SO WHAT I'M HEARING IS IF

01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:22.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERSIGHT OP

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEETINGS THAT WE WOULDN'T BE ON

01:43:25.332 --> 01:43:25.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRACK AND THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:26.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:27.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
USE THAT YOU SAID ABOUT TWO OR

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THREE TIMES AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:30.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THESE

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:31.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
HEARINGS. AND SO THAT'S

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:33.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I IT

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASICALLY MEANS TO ME THAT IF WE

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T KEEP YOU ABA KEEP BRINGING

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:39.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU BACK THAT THAT THIS IS NOT.

01:43:39.613 --> 01:43:41.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO OUR

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:42.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTINUE THE PROJECT AND THAT'S

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:43.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
WHAT TO ME OFF.

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:46.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IS THAT IF

01:43:46.119 --> 01:43:46.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WE DON'T KEEP HAVING THESE

01:43:46.687 --> 01:43:47.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEARINGS WERE NOT GONNA BE ON

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRACK WHILE I'M EXPECTING BAD.

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:50.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WEATHER WE HAVE THE HEARINGS ARE

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:51.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOT THAT WE SHOULD BE ON TRACK

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:53.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:55.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE THE PROJECT ITSELF.

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:56.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY AND

01:43:58.098 --> 01:43:59.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:01.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MY FRUSTRATION LEVEL IS AS HIGH

01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:04.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AS YOURS QUITE FRANKLY.

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:07.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT HAS TAKEN OZONE AQUARIA LONG

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TIME TO GET HERE. THE REFERENCE

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:11.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO THE MEETINGS OR I THINK IT

01:44:11.945 --> 01:44:12.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
HELPS US.

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:14.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:15.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TO THE

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:17.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
GENERAL PUBLIC.

01:44:17.551 --> 01:44:20.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CAN'T REACH OUT TO EVERYONE.

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY WE CAN

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:24.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND INFORM

01:44:24.491 --> 01:44:26.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEM WHAT'S GOING ON. LOOK AT

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:27.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT BUT WHY CAN'T WE REACH OUT

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:29.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TO EVERYONE.

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:31.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE. TIME OR

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:32.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE RESOURCES TO REACH OUT TO

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:34.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EVERYONE SO IF YOU CATCH.

01:44:34.735 --> 01:44:36.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
SOME PEOPLE.

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:39.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

COMMUNICATION.

01:44:48.815 --> 01:44:50.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I THINK THAT THAT LEADS TO A A

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD POINT AND A GOOD QUESTION

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:53.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN TERMS OF THE APPROPRIATE THAT

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

FAST ON THE DEPARTMENT. HOA THE

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONTRACTING PROCESS DOESN'T GO

MAY KNOW THAT THE OF THE

01:50:51.444 --> 01:50:53.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLANNING PROCESS WE UNDERSTAND

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:55.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
FROM A DEPARTMENT.

UPON THIS SUNDAY ON SCIENCE THE

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PROJECT LET ME ADD OTHER

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HOUSEHOLDER THAT OUR. PETS THE

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:23.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
REASON FOR THE DESIGN BILL.

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:23.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE CAN GET THAT UNDER CONTRACT.

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:26.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MUCH FASTER.

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:28.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY BE

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:30.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
CONSTRUCTING.

01:51:30.316 --> 01:51:32.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PART OF THE PROJECT OUR

01:51:32.085 --> 01:51:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DESIGNING THE OTHER PART OF THE

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROJECT.

01:51:34.754 --> 01:51:36.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SAU WAS THE IDEA BEHIND A SIGN

01:51:36.456 --> 01:51:38.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
DON'T.

01:51:38.124 --> 01:51:40.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRY TO SPEED THAT PROCESS UP.

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXAMPLE I

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:43.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:45.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
OF A PROCESS THAT IS.

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BEEN COMPRESSED AS MUCH AS WE

01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAN COMPRESS IT IT JUST TAKES

01:51:49.536 --> 01:51:50.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT LONG TO GET THROUGH THAT

01:51:50.603 --> 01:51:52.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROCESS.

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:55.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WAYS.

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:57.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE WAY MY COMPRESSORS AND MATT

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAS BEEN ON BOARD FOR WHAT THREE

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:01.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
WEEKS OR SO.

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:03.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HARD TO COORDINATE THAT AND SEE

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF THERE ARE WAYS TO COMPRESS IT

01:52:04.851 --> 01:52:07.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
EVEN FURTHER.

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:08.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT AFTER THAT AFTER A CERTAIN

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:11.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
POINT.

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE JUST ISN'T ANY MORE SWEET

01:52:13.293 --> 01:52:15.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ZERO I MEAN YOU CAN'T.

01:52:15.428 --> 01:52:17.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU CAN COMPRESS THAT BEYOND YOU

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:20.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN.

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:24.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN HARM.

01:52:24.237 --> 01:52:26.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TIME FRAMES FOR THE.

OF THE.

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:22.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NOT SO MUCH RANKING THE LEVEL OF

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:23.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPORTANCE BECAUSE I WOULD SAY

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:25.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT THEY'RE BOTH EXTREMELY

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:27.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

OROVILLE.

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:57.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND WE COULD LOOK AT WHY WE

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:58.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
COULD LOOK AT. THAT TO SEE IF

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THERE WAS.

01:54:00.567 --> 01:54:02.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND EMERGENCY DECLARED OR WHAT

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:04.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
PROCESS WAS USED.

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:06.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT OROVILLE THAT COULD SPEED

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINGS UP BECAUSE CERTAINLY.

THAT WAS AN EXPEDITED SCHEDULE.

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:14.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT.

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:16.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
IT IS THERE IS THERE.

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:17.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AN EMERGENCY THAT NEEDS TO BE

LOCALLY WE'VE DECLARED IT AS. A

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:27.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS STATE OF

OUR PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT.

OF ECONOMIC THREAT OUGHT TO THE

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:33.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
REGION I MEAN IS THERE A

SOMETHING OF THAT SORT OF ACTION

01:54:35.768 --> 01:54:36.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

THE CALL.

01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:52.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

GOVERNOR WE CAN MAKE THE CALL

01:54:52.952 --> 01:54:54.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

SOMETHING MAYBE. ARM.

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:59.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FOR THE DEPARTMENT THE DESIGN

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:01.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUILD PROCESS IS BRAND NEW.

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:03.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE IS A STEEP LEARNING CURVE

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TO FIGURE

02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:05.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

WE ARE MAKING GOOD STRIDES IN

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:13.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:01:13.566 --> 02:01:15.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I THINK ONCE WE ESTABLISH

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:16.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:18.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
FACILITATE.

02:01:18.237 --> 02:01:20.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOVING CONSTRUCTION FORWARD MUCH

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:22.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

AND SO WHAT'S IN THE WAY OF

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:31.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALLOWING ONE OF THOSE PARTNERS

02:01:31.784 --> 02:01:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE LEAD ON

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:34.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT PARTICULAR PART OF. WHAT

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:36.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE

CONSULTING FIRMS AND DESIGN

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:54.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

STATE STAFF TRYING TO DO ALL THE

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:58.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DESIGN WORK AND AND THAT'S WHAT

02:02:58.604 --> 02:02:59.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO.

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:01.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HOMICIDE DO THINK THAT WILL

FIGURE OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:11.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ESTABLISH THAT AND THEN LET ME

02:03:11.317 --> 02:03:13.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADD THAT I DON'T THINK AT LEAST

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:16.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RIGHT NOW. THAT STAFF IS THE

02:03:16.789 --> 02:03:18.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
PROBLEM AND.

02:03:18.724 --> 02:03:20.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
AND LEARNING THE.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND DEVELOPING THE DESIGN BILL

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:25.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S THAT'S OUR

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:27.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
EXISTING STAFF LEARNING AND

02:07:51.997 --> 02:07:53.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPACT OF THE

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:54.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SALTON SEA ON THE POOR AIR

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:56.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUALITY. AND ITS EFFECTS ON

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:58.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
HEALTH IN THE REGION.

02:07:58.337 --> 02:07:59.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SALTON SEA IS ALREADY.

02:07:59.772 --> 02:08:01.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:03.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:05.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HEALTH THE COACHELLA VALLEY. ON

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:06.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HEALTH ASSESSMENT SURVEYS HAVE

02:08:06.745 --> 02:08:08.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOUND THAT IN THE REGION AROUND

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:09.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SALTON SEA ASTHMA RATES ARE

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:11.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMEPLACE APPROACHING DOUBLE THE

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:14.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RATE IN CALIFORNIA IN GENERAL.

02:08:14.586 --> 02:08:16.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS

02:08:16.321 --> 02:08:18.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE

02:08:18.624 --> 02:08:19.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEALTH EFFECTS BUT BE ASSURED

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:21.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT. CHRONIC ILLNESSES RELATED

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:25.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON QUALITY

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:28.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF LIFE AND DAYS OF WORK LOS

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ILLEGALS CERTAINLY INCREASE IF

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:31.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE SOUND SEEMED FIREMAN

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:33.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DEGRADES FURTHER.

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:34.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:36.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LUNG DISEASE THAT STRONGLY

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:37.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INFLUENCED BY THE QUALITY OF THE

02:08:37.709 --> 02:08:39.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AIR THAT WE BREATHE. UP WE IN

02:08:39.311 --> 02:08:40.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:42.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:42.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:43.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
POLLUTION AND HEALTH.

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:44.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
INCLUDING LONG AND

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
GENERAL FACTS ON HOW.

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT IT'S ALSO EVIDENT THAT

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:50.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
POLLUTION IS NOT THE ONLY

02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:51.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AFFECTING

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HEALTH.

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:54.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT POLLUTION HAS BEEN STEADILY

02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:56.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DECREASING IN AMERICAN CITIES

02:08:56.895 --> 02:08:58.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S A NAGGING STATISTIC THAT

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:00.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ASPIRATE CONTINUE TO INCREASE?

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:01.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:03.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMPLETELY IDENTIFY ALL THE

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:05.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RELEVANT FACTORS AFFECTING

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PULMONARY AND CARDIOVASCULAR

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:08.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HEALTH.

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:09.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO ONE DEVELOPMENT AREA OF STUDY

02:09:09.808 --> 02:09:10.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
IS THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:11.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICULATE MATTER IN THE AIR.

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:09:13.612 --> 02:09:15.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND IT'S IMPACT ON HEALTH. ONE

02:09:15.881 --> 02:09:18.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MAJOR INDICATOR OF OF VERY SMALL

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:19.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AEROSOL PARTICULATES IS CALLED

02:09:19.952 --> 02:09:21.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PM TEN. WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF

02:09:21.987 --> 02:09:23.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MATERIAL THE AIR LESS THAN TEN

02:09:23.455 --> 02:09:25.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
MICRONS IN SIZE.

02:09:25.657 --> 02:09:27.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SO FOR REFERENCE OF TEN MICRONS

02:09:27.626 --> 02:09:29.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS LESS THAN A TENTH OF THE

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:32.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AVERAGE HUMAN HERE. IN AND. WITH

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:33.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:35.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TYPICAL POLLEN GRAINS.

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:37.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE PARTICLE SIZES MOST RELEVANT

02:09:37.269 --> 02:09:39.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BECAUSE HE'S EXTREMELY SMALL

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:40.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PARTICLES ARE ABLE PENETRATE

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:42.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DEEP INTO THE LUNG TISSUE. AND

02:09:42.808 --> 02:09:45.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRIGGER INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES.

02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:46.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDIES THAT PREVIOUSLY SHOWN

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:47.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY A

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:51.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AVERAGE NUMBER OF DEATHS OR

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:53.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
EXCESS DEATHS.

02:09:53.152 --> 02:09:54.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM PULMONARY OR CARDIOVASCULAR

02:09:54.953 --> 02:09:56.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAUSES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FOUR

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DAYS FOLLOWING DUST STORM WITH

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:00.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HIGH LEVELS OF PM TEN.

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:01.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE WOULD BE CONSIDERED ACUTE

02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
EFFECTS

02:10:02.594 --> 02:10:04.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT IS AFFECTED OCCUR QUITE SOON

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:06.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AFTER EXPOSURE IN CONTRAST TO

02:10:06.465 --> 02:10:07.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHRONIC EFFECTS WHICH TAKE YEARS

02:10:07.866 --> 02:10:09.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
TO DEVELOP.

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THESE ACUTE EFFECTS ONLY BEGIN

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:12.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO POINT OUT THE EFFECTS OF LOW

02:10:12.905 --> 02:10:14.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DOSE CHRONIC EXPOSURES ON

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:16.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES

02:10:16.341 --> 02:10:19.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INCLUDING ASTHMA AND COPD.

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:20.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO IT'S ALREADY EVIDENT THAT

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:21.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AEROSOL PARTICULAR THROUGH

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:22.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HEALTH

02:10:22.414 --> 02:10:24.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
RISKS.

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:25.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NOTE ALSO THAT CHRONIC DISEASES

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:27.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SUCH AS ASTHMA DO NOT HAVE

02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:29.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
SIMPLE CURES.

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:30.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THESE ARE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT

02:10:30.889 --> 02:10:31.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER

02:10:31.857 --> 02:10:33.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
TIME.

02:10:33.425 --> 02:10:35.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO THERE MEDICAL AND ECONOMIC

02:10:35.394 --> 02:10:36.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPACTS STAYS WITH US IN THE

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:39.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
LONG TERM.

02:10:39.331 --> 02:10:40.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN THE STUDIES OF COACHELLA

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:41.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
VALLEY DUST TO DUST STORMS THAT

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:43.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
I MENTIONED.

02:10:43.335 --> 02:10:44.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE DUST

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:46.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONTRIBUTING TO THE FACTS HAVE

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:48.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
NOT YET BEEN ANALYZED.

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:49.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SALTON SEA

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:51.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HOWEVER THE COMPONENTS OF THE

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:53.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
DUST ARE RELEVANT.

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT THE EXPOSED LAKE BED THE AT

DISEASES.

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:34.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASED AEROSOL PARTICULATES

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE ALSO INSISTED WITH SYSTEMIC

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:50.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THESE EFFECTS SIMPLY POINT TO

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:51.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE OVERALL GENERAL HEALTH

HAS EXAMINED THE THE AEROSOL

02:12:12.424 --> 02:12:13.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DUST IN THE VALLEY AND FOUND

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:15.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT AS MUCH AS SEVENTY PERCENT

02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:16.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:18.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
PLY AT THE SALTON SEA.

02:12:20.899 --> 02:12:22.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S THE PHONE THING DRIES UP

02:12:22.334 --> 02:12:23.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
DUE TO REDUCED INPUT FROM

02:12:23.635 --> 02:12:25.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:26.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DUST WILL NOT ONLY COMPRISE A

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:27.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
GREATER PROPORTION OF THE

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AEROSOL PARTICULATE. BUT WILL

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:30.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ALSO INCREASE THE OVERALL

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:32.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONCENTRATION OF PARTICULATES IN

02:12:33.045 --> 02:12:34.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE VALLEY.

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS NOT ONLY NARAL CONCERN TO

02:12:36.615 --> 02:12:37.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE PEOPLE LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO

WINTER AND SPRING MONTHS.

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:02.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:04.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MONTHS THE WINDS ALSO CARRY

02:13:04.576 --> 02:13:05.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICLES NORTH AND WEST WHERE

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE CITIES OF PALM DESERT IN

02:13:07.646 --> 02:13:10.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PALM SPRINGS ARE AFFECTED.

02:13:10.182 --> 02:13:12.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE SULFURIC ODORS EMITTED BY

02:13:18.023 --> 02:13:19.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DRIFT

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:20.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AS FAR AS ORANGE AND SAN

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:22.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BERNARDINO COUNTIES WHEN THE

02:13:22.327 --> 02:13:24.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WINDS ARE JUST RIGHT.

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:26.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO IT SHOULD BE NO COMFORT TO

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:27.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW THAT INCREASING LEVELS OF

AS WELL.

02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO MANY OF OTHERS HAVE ALREADY

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:35.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR TO THE CRISIS OF THE SALTON

THAT WAS VALUABLE THAT SERVES AS

02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:13.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FOUNDATION OF THE SALT SEA

02:23:13.918 --> 02:23:15.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT IS A MODEL

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS.

02:23:20.258 --> 02:23:21.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PART OF THE SOLUTION MOVING

02:23:21.225 --> 02:23:22.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FORWARD HAD WE KEEP THINGS ON

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:24.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRACK LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WORKS

02:23:24.662 --> 02:23:26.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WHAT HAS WORKED.

02:23:26.431 --> 02:23:28.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND WHAT IS CONTINUING TO WORK

02:23:28.366 --> 02:23:30.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OH I SUBMITTED SOME WRITTEN

02:23:30.234 --> 02:23:32.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TESTIMONY. PER REQUEST FROM THE

02:23:32.337 --> 02:23:34.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHAIR THAT WILL GO INTO ALL THE

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:35.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DETAILS CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

02:23:35.606 --> 02:23:36.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
READ IT IN THE INTEREST TIME.

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:38.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE WITH

02:23:38.409 --> 02:23:41.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LOCALS LEAD WE ALL SUCCEED

02:23:41.079 --> 02:23:43.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AN EXAMPLE THIS IN RECENT MEMORY

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:46.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE LAST MONTH. THE LOCALS WITH

02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:47.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE SALT SEA AUTHORITY HAS LEAD

02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:49.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AGENCY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:52.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:53.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:54.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOWARDS MARTINEZ CAHUILLA DESERT

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:56.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TRIBE.

02:23:56.194 --> 02:23:58.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLEADED THE FIRST PHASE OF THE

02:23:58.196 --> 02:23:58.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TOWARDS MARTINEZ WETLANDS

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:00.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROJECT.

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THIS IS THE FIRST STATE FUNDED

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:03.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECT EVER COMPLETED AT THE

02:24:03.301 --> 02:24:04.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SALTON SEA.

02:24:04.869 --> 02:24:06.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WHILE IT IS SMALL IT IS

02:24:06.804 --> 02:24:09.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CERTAINLY OF MONUMENTAL IN THE

02:24:09.073 --> 02:24:10.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FACT IT IS BEGINNING OF FIRST

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:11.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TANGIBLE STEP.

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:12.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TOWARD WHAT MUST HAPPEN A

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THOUSAND TIMES OVER.

02:24:14.712 --> 02:24:17.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NOW WE HAVE THE MEANS WE HAVE

02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:18.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE CAPABILITY THE COMPETENCY OF

02:24:18.716 --> 02:24:20.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:24:20.251 --> 02:24:21.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO DELIVER ON TIME ON BUDGET AS

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT PROJECT WAS AS WELL IS THE

02:24:23.888 --> 02:24:24.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY ACTION

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:26.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PLAN I MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:24:26.824 --> 02:24:29.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WE HAVE THE MOTIVATION AT THE

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:31.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
LOCAL LEVEL IN CONCERT.

02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:32.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE STATE

02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:34.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND I THINK THAT IS THE KEY

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:36.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WORKING THE LOCALS INTO A SENSE

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:38.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF WHAT THE STATE OF HOW WE GET

02:24:38.503 --> 02:24:40.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON BOARD.

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:41.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:43.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IF THE LOCALS HAD NOT SET ASIDE

02:24:43.107 --> 02:24:44.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
DIFFERENCES.

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:46.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LONG YEARS AGO THAT SEPARATED

02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:48.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEM AND DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO

02:24:48.546 --> 02:24:50.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MOVE FORWARD AND UNIFIED FASHION

02:24:50.415 --> 02:24:52.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ON PLANS AND PROJECTS.

02:24:52.383 --> 02:24:53.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND IT AT A UNITED EFFORT

02:24:53.951 --> 02:24:54.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
APPEARS SACRAMENTO AND BACK IN

02:24:55.019 --> 02:24:56.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
DC

02:24:56.287 --> 02:24:57.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT THE LOCALS CAME TOGETHER WE

02:24:57.789 --> 02:24:59.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STARTED TO SEE PROGRESS.

02:24:59.957 --> 02:25:01.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD

02:25:01.626 --> 02:25:03.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ESTHER LOCAL LEADERSHIP.

02:25:03.327 --> 02:25:04.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND WITHOUT THAT IF WE JUST

02:25:04.796 --> 02:25:06.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CONTINUE TO GO DOWN THE PATH OF

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:08.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRUSTING THE STATE TO MOVE. AND

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:10.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:12.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF LOCAL FRANKLY HAD VERY LITTLE

02:25:12.203 --> 02:25:13.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FAITH THAT WHAT'S GOING TO

02:25:13.304 --> 02:25:14.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
HAPPEN ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE.

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:17.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE LOCALS DECIDED THEY WOULD.

WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES

02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:34.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LET'S MAKE SURE THOSE CHALLENGES

SEE WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE GOING

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:13.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO BE LOCATED BUT WHAT'S MORE

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:15.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IMPORTNT IS WHAT YOU DO NOT SEE

ON THAT MATTER. WHAT YOU DO NOT

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:19.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

COMMUNITIES ARE LEADING TO THE

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:23.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SALTON SEA? AND TO WHETHER THESE

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:23.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
COMMUNITIES GET TO.

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:26.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM SOME OF

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:27.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:28.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PROPOSED

.

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:33.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I DID OUT PUT A MAP RIGHT NEXT

02:29:33.764 --> 02:29:35.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
TO IT THAT SHOWS. AND.

02:29:35.833 --> 02:29:37.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BREAD AND THE THE REASON THAT

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:38.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THESE COMMUNITIES ARE RED IS

02:29:38.536 --> 02:29:39.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BECAUSE THEY ARE DEEPLY

02:29:39.637 --> 02:29:41.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

02:29:41.639 --> 02:29:41.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
YOU.

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:46.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
pTWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT

THE SEA.

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:51.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
AND THERE ARE OF FOR

02:29:51.549 --> 02:29:54.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COMMUNITIES BONE BY BEACH NORTH

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:54.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%

02:29:54.885 --> 02:29:57.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
ANON.

02:29:57.154 --> 02:29:58.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE THE SALTON SEA AREAWEST

02:29:58.322 --> 02:30:00.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHOICE AREA THAT REALLY IN THE

02:30:01.058 --> 02:30:02.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TEN YEAR PLAN DO NOT GIVE

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:03.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
ADDRESSED

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:05.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HOME OUT EXCEPT I SHOULD SAY

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:06.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT THERE ARE SOME RECENT

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:08.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ATTEMPTS THAT MAYBE ARE NOT

02:30:08.265 --> 02:30:09.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REFLECTED IN THE TEN YEAR PLAN

02:30:10.034 --> 02:30:11.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO DO SOMETHING IN WEST SHORE

02:30:11.569 --> 02:30:13.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SINCE I'VE HEARD RECENTLY.

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:15.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M SO WHY I'M THAT IS IMPORTANT

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILL IT'S NOT ONLY ON THAT MAP

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:19.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK THAT TEN WHEN

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:20.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
YOU READ AT THE.

02:30:21.011 --> 02:30:23.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
TEN YEAR PLAN.

02:30:23.247 --> 02:30:25.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
YOU ALSO SEE THAT OF ARE

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:28.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMUNITIES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN

02:30:28.119 --> 02:30:30.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE USED

02:30:30.755 --> 02:30:30.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TO IDENTIFY.

02:30:31.055 --> 02:30:31.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:30:31.789 --> 02:30:33.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROJECTS.

02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:33.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
OR.

02:30:34.058 --> 02:30:35.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:30:35.593 --> 02:30:37.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OR THE LOCATION FOURTHS OF SUCH

02:30:37.294 --> 02:30:39.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROJECTS SO ON THE TEN YEAR PLAN

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:41.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STIPULATES THAT THE AIR QUALITY

02:30:41.298 --> 02:30:42.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MITIGATION WILL CONSIST OF

02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:44.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MEASURES TO KEEP EXPOSE PLAYA

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WET. OR VEGETATED.

02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:48.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT ALSO SAYS THAT DETERMINATION

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:50.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF PI EMISSIVITY WILL DRIVE THE

02:30:50.608 --> 02:30:51.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
LOCATION OF THAT DUST

02:30:52.009 --> 02:30:53.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
SUPPRESSION PROJECTS

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:54.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
NEITHER THE PROJECTS WERE

02:30:54.745 --> 02:30:56.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MITIGATING DOES NOR THE CITING

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THESE PROJECTS TO GIVE SENATE

02:30:58.115 --> 02:30:58.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CONSIDERATION TO IMPROVING

02:30:58.682 --> 02:31:04.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
QUALITY OF LIFE.

02:31:04.522 --> 02:31:06.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO BY OVERLAYING THE CURRENT MAP

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:08.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THE EXISTING COMMUNITIES I

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:09.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
REALLY THINK THAT ON IT COULD

02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:12.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SERVE THE STATE ASSEMBLY MINDER

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:14.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT THE STATE HAS AN OBLIGATION

02:31:14.532 --> 02:31:16.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S FAR GREATER THAN ADHERING

02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:17.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO THE QUANTIFICATION SETTLEMENT

02:31:17.568 --> 02:31:19.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AGREEMENT. AND THE RECENTLY

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:21.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AMENDED STIPULATED ORDER THE

CALIFORNIANS ONTO THIS AND.

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:28.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HEALTH IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD IN

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:29.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ITS BROAD DEFINITION TO INCLUDE

02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:51.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION.

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:52.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
TALKED ABOUT OUTREACH

02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:54.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE

02:31:54.905 --> 02:31:57.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAS COME A LONG WAYS IN THEIR

02:31:57.875 --> 02:31:59.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WILLINGNESS TO ON TO.

02:31:59.109 --> 02:31:59.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
OUTREACH

02:31:59.910 --> 02:32:01.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
BUT.

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:03.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL BUT WE

02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:05.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WANT TO SEE IF SINGLE ANCIENT

02:32:05.282 --> 02:32:06.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT PROCESS.

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:08.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OUTREACHES WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:32:08.252 --> 02:32:10.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

THAT WE SAW ON THE DICE.

02:32:28.606 --> 02:32:30.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S FRUSTRATION AND THERE'S

02:32:30.274 --> 02:32:32.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REALLY NO VENUE FOR INPUT

02:32:32.943 --> 02:32:33.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
NOW WE KNOW THAT.

02:32:33.744 --> 02:32:35.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

AND SO AGAIN WE NEED TO START

02:33:04.408 --> 02:33:06.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOKING AT OUR COMMUNITIES ASK

02:33:06.176 --> 02:33:07.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE STATE WE

02:33:22.293 --> 02:33:23.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

TRUE PARTICIPATORY ENGAGEMENT ON

02:33:31.302 --> 02:33:32.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PROCESS AND WE.

02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:34.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIRST OF ALL IS THAT WE NEED TO

02:33:34.238 --> 02:33:36.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE THE PROCESS AS ONE THAT IS

02:33:36.206 --> 02:33:37.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
INTEGRATED AND.

02:33:37.207 --> 02:33:39.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AS THE TEN YEAR PLAN HAS

HAPPENED IS THE PLANNING HAPPEN

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:42.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON ONE END AND NOW IT'S LIKE

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:43.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE'RE BACK PEDALING TO GOING

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:45.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INFORM THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE

02:33:45.182 --> 02:33:46.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
RESPONSIBILITIES AND HOW ARE WE

02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:53.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GOING TO REALLY BRING SOLUTIONS

02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:59.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PEOPLE LIVING NEAR THE SEA.

PROCESS

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:01.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A SECOND AS WE NEED ENGAGE IN

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:02.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FACILITATION A COMMUNITY

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:03.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ENGAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE A TWO WAY

02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:04.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
STREET.

02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:06.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:08.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THIS REQUIRES THE STATE TO BE

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:08.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILLING TO LEARN AND KNOW HOW TO

02:34:09.006 --> 02:34:10.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
ASK

02:34:10.341 --> 02:34:12.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUESTIONS AND ENGAGE IN DIALOGUE

02:34:12.176 --> 02:34:13.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT COULD INFORM A POSSIBLE

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:14.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ACTION. THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:17.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GENUINE INTEREST IN LISTENING TO

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:18.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND REFLECTING THE NEEDS THE

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:20.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONCERNS THAT DREAMS THAT THIS

02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:23.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMMUNITY HAS FOR THE SEAT.

02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:25.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ACCESSIBILITY.

02:34:25.689 --> 02:34:26.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOCUSING ON THE PROCESS ALLOWS

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:28.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE MEETINGS WITH THE COMMUNITY

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:30.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BECOME OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD

02:34:30.794 --> 02:34:32.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RELATIONSHIPS RATHER THAN SIMPLE

02:34:32.229 --> 02:34:33.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TRANSACTION.

02:34:33.631 --> 02:34:33.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

02:34:35.165 --> 02:34:37.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BUILD SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BEING ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF WHAT

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:40.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEEDS TO HAPPEN OF THE SCENE. AT

02:34:40.371 --> 02:34:42.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE SCENE.

02:34:42.806 --> 02:34:44.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT.

02:34:44.274 --> 02:34:46.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO LOOK AS MUCH AS TO WHO

02:34:46.210 --> 02:34:48.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITHIN THE ROOM. WHERE THE

02:34:48.078 --> 02:34:50.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MEETINGS ARE LOCATED ON HOW THE

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:51.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INFORMATION IS PRESENTED?

02:34:51.949 --> 02:34:53.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND THE SPACES NEED TO BE

02:34:53.784 --> 02:34:55.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
COMFORTABLE.

02:34:55.886 --> 02:34:57.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR RESIDENTS WHERE INFORMAL

02:34:58.055 --> 02:34:59.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS.

02:34:59.356 --> 02:35:01.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE ARE VALUED AS

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:02.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MUCH AS THE AGENCY PRESENTATIONS

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
AND DATE.

02:35:04.294 --> 02:35:06.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
AND FINALLY FOR THIS.

02:35:06.363 --> 02:35:07.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PORTION IS THE STATE REALLY

02:35:07.998 --> 02:35:09.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
NEEDS TO EMBRACE TRANSPARENCY

02:35:09.533 --> 02:35:11.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND ACCEPT ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE

02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:12.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
COMMUNITY.

02:35:12.836 --> 02:35:14.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
MANY OF THE QUESTIONS.

02:35:16.373 --> 02:35:18.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT WE OWE HERE IN FORUMS IS

02:35:18.609 --> 02:35:19.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE MONEY

02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:20.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HOW IS IT SPENT AND.

02:35:20.978 --> 02:35:22.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I MEAN THE FIRST PRESENTATION

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:23.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GIVE US VERY GOOD INFORMATION ON

02:35:23.681 --> 02:35:25.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT BUT BEYOND THAT I THINK THE

02:35:25.549 --> 02:35:27.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
STATE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR AND SET

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CLEAR PARAMETERS THAT DEFINE THE

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:31.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PURPOSE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

02:35:31.989 --> 02:35:33.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES FROM

02:35:33.924 --> 02:35:35.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT WHAT IS THE PURPOSE TO ENGAGE

02:35:35.759 --> 02:35:37.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE COMMUNITY IF OUR INPUT IS AT

02:35:37.227 --> 02:35:39.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE END WILL NOTBE REFLECTED ON

02:35:39.196 --> 02:35:41.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE PLAN. AT THAT'S THE KEYS

02:35:41.432 --> 02:35:43.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
STONING AGENTS.

02:35:43.701 --> 02:35:45.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT AND THEN MOVING ON TO.

02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:47.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:35:47.104 --> 02:35:48.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COLD BENEFITS BEYOND DUST

02:35:48.672 --> 02:35:50.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
MITIGATION

02:35:50.207 --> 02:35:53.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE

02:35:53.077 --> 02:35:54.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TEN YEAR PLAN FAILED TO CONSIDER

02:35:54.978 --> 02:35:56.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HOW ITS HABITAT AND THAT'S

02:35:56.246 --> 02:35:57.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
MITIGATION EFFORTS IMPACT

02:35:57.715 --> 02:35:59.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
QUALITY OF LIFE. YET THERE IS AN

02:40:24.548 --> 02:40:26.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND NOW THE POTENTIAL OF HAVING

02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:27.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT

02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:29.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
YOU KNOW TO ME THAT'S LIKE.

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:31.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

MADE IT TO THE WORLD SERIES IT.

02:40:33.056 --> 02:40:33.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
BUT THEN IT WENT.

02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:35.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
RIGHT.

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:37.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET AS

02:40:37.928 --> 02:40:39.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IT RELATES TO WHAT NEEDS TO

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
HAPPEN.

02:40:40.664 --> 02:40:42.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%

GET A CONFIRMATION IF I IF I

WROTE THIS DOWN CORRECTLY.

02:40:51.108 --> 02:40:52.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AS YOU SAID THE SEVENTY PERCENT

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:52.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

OF THE DUST

02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:05.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M YOU CAN ACTUALLY DETERMINE

02:41:05.455 --> 02:41:06.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHETHER IT'S SAFE FROM DESERT

02:41:06.990 --> 02:41:08.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOILS THAT SORT OF THING. AND

02:41:08.859 --> 02:41:10.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT SET UP

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:12.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TO SEVENTY PERCENT IS COMING

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:13.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIRECTLY FROM THE EXPOS PLY.

THAT'S NOT A A STATISTIC THAT I

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:42.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAVE HEARD BEFORE. CERTAINLY

02:41:42.225 --> 02:41:43.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

THE AIR QUALITY IN THE REGION

02:41:55.372 --> 02:41:57.574 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
AND THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT WE
KNOW.

02:41:57.641 --> 02:41:59.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT THAT WILL TRANSLATE INTO

GREATER PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS.

02:42:01.611 --> 02:42:02.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

IN YOUR OPINION I JUST BASED ON

02:42:28.872 --> 02:42:30.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PRESENTATIONS A RESEARCH THAT

02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:31.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
YOU'VE DONE?

TO DECREASE THAT SEVENTY

I AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT LEAD

02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:41.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO THE SEVENTY PERCENT DUSTIN

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:43.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THEM THAT WE'VE HAD SOME

02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:45.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE BREED

02:42:45.489 --> 02:42:46.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
CENTER ON ON THE QUESTION I

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:47.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:49.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THERE ISN'T AN IN THE

02:42:49.593 --> 02:42:51.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT THERE ISN'T

02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:52.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A LOT OF DETAIL ON WHETHER OR

02:42:52.996 --> 02:42:54.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NOT. THESE.

02:42:54.564 --> 02:42:55.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DUST SUPPRESSION.

02:42:56.032 --> 02:42:57.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ACTIVITIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING

02:42:57.701 --> 02:42:58.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO BE EFFECTIVE AND I THINK

02:42:59.002 --> 02:43:00.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S ONE CONCERN BECAUSE THE

02:43:00.770 --> 02:43:02.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EXPOS PIE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:43:02.439 --> 02:43:02.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
GROW.

02:43:03.039 --> 02:43:04.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
SOME I WOULD ALSO.

02:43:04.541 --> 02:43:06.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MENTION THAT YOU KNOW WHERE

02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:09.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO HAVING TO LOOK AT IT YOU

02:43:09.179 --> 02:43:10.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T JUST HAVE TO LIVE BY THE

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:11.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SHORES OF SOUND SEEM TO BE

02:43:11.381 --> 02:43:12.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
AFFECTED

02:43:12.415 --> 02:43:13.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BECAUSE OF THE PARTICLE

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:15.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TRANSPORT REALLY GOES THROUGHOUT

02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:17.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THE. COACHELLA VALLEY.

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:18.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
AND SO.

02:43:18.655 --> 02:43:21.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT IS A CONCERN NOT JUST

02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:24.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOCALLY TOM TO THE DUST AT THE

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:25.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AT THE PLAYA BUT ALSO EXTENDING

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:27.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THROUGH THE.

02:43:27.297 --> 02:43:28.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
VALLEY.

02:43:28.198 --> 02:43:29.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I THINK

02:43:29.432 --> 02:43:30.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THINK

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:32.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
OF IN TERMS OF THE TOM

02:43:32.869 --> 02:43:34.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POPULATIONS THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ARE AFFECTED. MAIN BE SOMETHING

02:43:36.873 --> 02:43:38.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TO IT CAN THE CONSIDERATION

02:43:38.208 --> 02:43:39.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
BEYOND JUST THE.

02:43:39.543 --> 02:43:42.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DUST AND THE DUST SUPPRESSION

02:43:42.345 --> 02:43:44.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BUT ALSO AT THE LEVEL OF WHERE

02:43:44.314 --> 02:43:46.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PEOPLE LIVE WHERE THEY WORK.

02:43:46.082 --> 02:43:48.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KIND OF TAKING AN ASSESSMENT OF

02:43:48.084 --> 02:43:50.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT EXPOSURES AND WHAT RISKS WE

02:43:50.587 --> 02:43:53.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
ARE ACTUALLY. NAM THAT.

02:43:53.256 --> 02:43:54.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEEING AMONG THE COMMUNITIES I

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:55.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THINK THAT MAYBE ANOTHER

02:43:55.825 --> 02:43:57.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
PERSPECTIVE TO LOOK AT.

02:43:57.961 --> 02:43:59.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THANK YOU I I WANNA THAT GET

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:00.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INTO THE COMMUNITY OUR REGION

A.

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:13.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT'S THE GAP THAT WE NEED TO

02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:14.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
KIND OF FILL IN HERE BECAUSE.

02:44:15.045 --> 02:44:17.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

NOT NOT JUST WITH THE.

02:44:26.756 --> 02:44:28.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN WHICH IS

02:44:28.091 --> 02:44:29.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE I THINK THE FOCAL POINT OF

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE PRESENTATION. UP BUT IN

02:44:31.761 --> 02:44:33.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING MOVING

02:44:33.396 --> 02:44:35.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

TO YOU KNOW VISIT DAY EVERY

02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:09.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

REACH POPULATION SPAS THAT'S

02:45:12.836 --> 02:45:14.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHAT WE DUBBED IT THE HARD TO

02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:15.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
REACH POPULATIONS.

02:45:15.639 --> 02:45:17.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF SOME OF THE REMEDIES CAN

OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ME THE

02:45:19.109 --> 02:45:20.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE THAT

02:45:20.477 --> 02:45:22.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FOR EVERY ACRE EXPOSE WE HAVE A

02:45:22.646 --> 02:45:24.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DOSE OF MITIGATION YOU KNOW FOR

02:45:24.781 --> 02:45:26.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

AT THAT RATE. THE REALITY IS IS

02:45:28.485 --> 02:45:29.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT COMMUNITY WILL HELP WAS

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TELL YOU THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE

02:45:37.994 --> 02:45:39.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WERE FOCUS ON THE LOCAL

02:45:39.362 --> 02:45:40.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

IN TERMS OF OUR DEAN WHAT'S A

02:46:06.856 --> 02:46:08.391 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LARGER FIX THAT'S WHAT I THINK

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:09.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TIME AND TIME AGAIN OVER THE

02:46:09.759 --> 02:46:10.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE SAID

02:46:17.667 --> 02:46:19.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WE CANNOT REVERSE.

02:46:19.769 --> 02:46:22.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IN A HALF A CENTURY OF THIS

I THINK IS THAT THERE IS NO

02:48:36.706 --> 02:48:38.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLEAR POINTS FOR WHEN COMMUNITY

WHAT WE'RE DOING.

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:57.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
THAT IF INFORMATION

02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:59.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT IS NOT ENGAGEMENT.

02:48:59.362 --> 02:49:02.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WHAT WE HAVE ASKED THE STATE.

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:04.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE SALTON SEA TEAM THAT'S

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INVOLVED WITHOUT REACHED ON IS

02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:07.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THEY PROVIDE US WITH WHERE

02:49:07.770 --> 02:49:09.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ARE THOSE KEY MILESTONES ON

02:49:09.472 --> 02:49:10.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUILDING HEALTHY COMMUNITIES IS

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALREADY ENGAGING COMMUNITY.

02:49:12.175 --> 02:49:13.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE WANT TO BRING THEM TO THIS

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:15.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MEETINGS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

02:49:15.078 --> 02:49:16.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SURE THAT IT'S MEANINGFUL AND

02:49:17.013 --> 02:49:19.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'M WE HAVE YET TO RECIEVE FOR

02:49:19.148 --> 02:49:20.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THOSE KEY MILESTONES.

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:22.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WILL BE AND WHERE WE CAN TO

02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:24.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUT THE

02:49:25.054 --> 02:49:25.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
OTHER.

02:49:25.822 --> 02:49:29.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GAP LIKE GUINNESS IN THE PLAN.

02:49:29.359 --> 02:49:31.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE ARE A ON PROJECTS ARE BEING

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:33.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOCATED BASED ON IN THE CITY. IT

02:49:33.796 --> 02:49:35.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DOESN'T MEAN THAT NINA NEXT TO

02:49:35.798 --> 02:49:37.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
NORTH SHORE WEST CHOICE.

02:49:37.567 --> 02:49:38.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
MECCA THAT THERE'S NO

02:49:38.935 --> 02:49:41.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EMISSIVITY IT JUST MEANS MAYBE

02:49:41.137 --> 02:49:42.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THERE'S MORE IN SOME AREAS

02:49:42.539 --> 02:49:43.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAN.

02:49:43.139 --> 02:49:45.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAN IN OTHERS.

02:49:45.642 --> 02:49:47.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT WE'RE NOT PRIORITIZE SEEN

02:49:47.944 --> 02:49:49.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE RIGHT

02:49:49.546 --> 02:49:50.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEXT TO THE SCENE EVEN THAT IF

02:49:50.813 --> 02:49:52.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE'S LOW EMISSIVITY ON THE

02:49:52.582 --> 02:49:54.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WEST OR THE EAST WHY ARE WE NOT

02:49:54.484 --> 02:49:56.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOING ANYTHING THERE. BECAUSE

02:49:56.119 --> 02:49:57.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S MORE EMISSIVITY IN THE

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:59.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
SOUTH AND I MEAN I DON'T KNOW

02:49:59.422 --> 02:50:01.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HOW NEAR THE COMMUNITIES I'M NOT

02:50:01.724 --> 02:50:01.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
AS FAMILIAR.

02:50:02.025 --> 02:50:03.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:04.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WITH HELP NEAR THE COMMUNITIES

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:05.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE TO THE SEA BUT I KNOW THAT

02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:06.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY WERE

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:08.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
LIVING RIGHT NEXT TO IT AND

02:50:08.097 --> 02:50:09.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE.

02:50:09.999 --> 02:50:10.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
MISTER ROSE TRAILER YOU HAVE.

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:12.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:13.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY

02:50:13.937 --> 02:50:14.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TO TAKE THE LEAD ON SOME

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:16.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
PROJECTS.

02:50:16.639 --> 02:50:19.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A AYE YOU SHARED A BIT ABOUT THE

02:50:19.175 --> 02:50:20.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A TORCH MARTINEZ PARTNERSHIP.

02:50:20.777 --> 02:50:23.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE MAGNITUDE OF PROJECT ISN'T

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:24.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ANYWHERE NEAR THE SCALE OF SOME

02:50:24.948 --> 02:50:26.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE WERE

02:50:26.082 --> 02:50:28.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DISCUSSING EARLIER BUT. CAN YOU

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:31.020 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
CAN YOU JUST STEP APPLY THE
SAME.

02:50:31.087 --> 02:50:32.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
APPROACH METHODOLOGY

02:50:33.022 --> 02:50:35.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TWO PROJECTS SAME SIZE OR LARGER

02:50:35.258 --> 02:50:36.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE REASON WHY I ASKED THE

02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:38.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUESTION IS YOU KNOW YOU'RE

02:50:38.094 --> 02:50:39.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
GOING TO BE TASK WITH THAT A

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:40.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
CHUNK OF MONEY.

02:50:40.597 --> 02:50:41.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POTENTIALLY THE COMES FROM PROP

02:50:41.864 --> 02:50:42.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
SIXTY EIGHT.

02:50:42.665 --> 02:50:44.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:50:44.534 --> 02:50:46.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ARE THERE PLANS TO GONNA TAKE

02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:47.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT MONEY AND BEGIN TO

02:50:47.804 --> 02:50:49.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES

02:50:49.906 --> 02:50:50.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT ARE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT

02:50:50.540 --> 02:50:51.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
PLAN ALREADY. KNOW MISTER

02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:53.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CHAIRMAN THAT IS OUR HOPE IS TO

02:50:53.509 --> 02:50:55.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAKE WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED AT THE

02:50:55.712 --> 02:50:57.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
SCALE OF COURSE MARTINEZ.

02:50:57.981 --> 02:50:59.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A WETLANDS PROJECT MANY OF THE

02:50:59.349 --> 02:51:01.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SAME.

02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:03.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
KINDS OF PROCESS SEIZE THE

02:51:03.086 --> 02:51:05.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERMITTING A PROCESS THESE ARE

02:51:05.421 --> 02:51:06.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE SAME WHETHER IT'S A LARGE

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:09.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROJECT OR A A SMALLER PROJECT

02:51:09.792 --> 02:51:11.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THE THE THE SAME STEPS HAVE

02:51:11.828 --> 02:51:13.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TO BE TAKEN.

02:51:13.596 --> 02:51:15.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGARDLESS OF SCALE IN IN MANY

02:51:16.032 --> 02:51:17.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
INSTANCES SO WHAT. GOOD BEING

02:51:17.934 --> 02:51:19.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ABLE TO TAKE A PUT MORE OF A

02:51:19.502 --> 02:51:21.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PILOT SCALE LEARN FROM THAT AND

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:24.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEN EXPAND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:51:24.073 --> 02:51:25.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE WANT TO DO WITH THE SALT SEA

02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:27.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WE HAVE A. NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT

02:51:27.777 --> 02:51:29.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
NOW TO DOUBLE THAT TOWARDS

02:51:29.779 --> 02:51:31.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MARTINEZ WETLANDS PROJECT WITH

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:33.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FACE TO THAT'S A MINUTE THAT AS

02:51:33.883 --> 02:51:35.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE SPEAK. DO WILL BEGIN THAT

02:51:35.985 --> 02:51:37.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
EXPANSION THAT'S I SHOULD

02:51:37.654 --> 02:51:39.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CLARIFY THAT'S UNDER A THAT A

02:51:39.288 --> 02:51:41.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POT OF MONEY FROM PROPERTY FOR.

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:42.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THIS WOULD NOT BE.

02:51:42.825 --> 02:51:44.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TAPPING INTO THAT EIGHTY

02:51:44.427 --> 02:51:46.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MILLION THOUGH UNDER PROP ONE OR

02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:47.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT PROP SIXTY EIGHT BUT OUR

02:51:47.664 --> 02:51:49.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
EXPECTATION IS THAT.

02:51:49.165 --> 02:51:52.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WAS MENTIONED EARLIER OF.

02:51:52.568 --> 02:51:53.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:51:53.603 --> 02:51:55.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
S. C. H. IS THE CLOSEST PROJECT

02:51:55.371 --> 02:51:57.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE STATE HAS TO ACTUALLY BEING.

02:51:57.106 --> 02:51:57.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED

02:51:58.041 --> 02:51:59.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
CONSTRUCTED.

02:51:59.542 --> 02:52:00.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THAT IS A

02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:02.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROJECT CONCEDE THAT THE NORTH

02:52:02.512 --> 02:52:04.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND NORTH LAKE WHICH WOULD BUILD

02:52:05.014 --> 02:52:06.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
INTO A LARGER. ABOUT.

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:08.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PERIMETER LIKE POTENTIALLY

02:52:08.284 --> 02:52:09.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AROUND THE EDGES OF THE SEA THAT

02:52:09.652 --> 02:52:10.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WOULD ADDRESS OF THOSE

02:52:10.486 --> 02:52:11.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
COMMUNITIES THAT TO MY

02:52:11.654 --> 02:52:13.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COLLEAGUES AWAY POSIT MENTION.

02:52:13.189 --> 02:52:16.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO OUR INTENT IS TO EXAMINE.

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:18.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROJECTS IN THAT AREA THAT WE

02:52:18.761 --> 02:52:21.664 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
CONCEIVED TO BE NEXT IN LINE
FOR.

02:52:21.731 --> 02:52:23.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IMPLEMENTATION AS FELLOW BRUCE

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WILCOX MENTION THERE IS A TASK

02:52:26.002 --> 02:52:26.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ORDER THAT IS.

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:28.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
HAS BEEN. RELEASED TO DO

02:52:29.005 --> 02:52:31.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FURTHER DEFINE THAT PROJECTS

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:32.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD CONFORM TO THE STATE

02:52:32.475 --> 02:52:35.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CRITERIA. BUT IT ALSO WILL MEET

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:38.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ADDITIONAL OF MULTIPLE DELIVERED

02:52:38.114 --> 02:52:40.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BENEFITS OR LOOKING FOR IN TERMS

OF RECREATION ECONOMIC

02:52:41.551 --> 02:52:43.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OPPORTUNITY WE THINK WE CAN DO

02:52:43.352 --> 02:52:45.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALL OF THOSE. IF WE INTEGRATE

02:52:45.955 --> 02:52:47.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE MULTIPLE BENEFITS IN A WAY

02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:50.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT CREATES DEEPWATER HABITAT.

02:52:50.259 --> 02:52:51.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:53.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AROUND THE CITY TO HIGH PRIORITY

02:52:53.162 --> 02:52:54.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT DONE. AS

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:55.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WELL AS PROTECTING THE

02:52:55.998 --> 02:52:57.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMUNITIES AND PERHAPS BUILDING

02:52:57.667 --> 02:52:59.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:00.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
CREATES A FINANCIAL TO WE

02:53:00.603 --> 02:53:01.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULDN'T HAVE OTHERWISE I KNOW

02:53:01.938 --> 02:53:04.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YOU'VE BEEN WORK IN A CLOSELY

02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:06.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY I.

02:53:06.375 --> 02:53:07.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:09.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY.

02:53:10.012 --> 02:53:12.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
THAT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
THE.

02:53:12.749 --> 02:53:14.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO SOME EXTENT YEAR THAT SAYS

02:53:35.838 --> 02:53:36.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBABLY NOT THE IDEAL WAY TO

APPROACH THIS.

02:53:38.407 --> 02:53:39.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEY MADE ADJUSTMENTS THEY

THOSE AGENCIES THAT WE THINK

02:55:46.102 --> 02:55:47.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COULD BRING TOGETHER THE FEDERAL
