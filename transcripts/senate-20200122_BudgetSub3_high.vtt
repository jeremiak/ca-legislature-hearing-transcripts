THEY'RE BEEN PREVIOUS EFFORTS

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.196
TO MEANS THE MOST RECENT TO

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:38.731

ATTEMPTS TO REFORM THE SYSTEM I

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.343
BELIEVE THE LAST- SIGNIFICANT

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.311
EFFORT WAS MADE IN EARLY TWO

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:56.215

THAT EXISTS TODAY. AND DUE TO-

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.459
RECESSIONARY CHALLENGES AT THAT

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:07.260
TIME THE EFFORT WAS SORT OF.

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.729
ECHO OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THAT

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:10.930
WAS IT THAT WAS JUST ONE I

FURTHER IN THE PAST. OKAY AND

00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:16.202

SERVICES TO MIX THAT WERE

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:48.180
UNDERSTANDING THINGS LIKE

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.315
STAFFING RATIOS ARE STAFFING

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.883
LEVELS THE PRODUCTIVITY OF

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.418
STAFF THAT IS TO SAY HOW MUCH

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.719
TIME THEY'RE SPENDING ON

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.054
BILLABLE ACTIVITIES WERE SADDAM

BILLABLE ACTIVITIES. ULTIMATELY

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.324
WE WERE PRETTY PLEASE WITH THE

PARTICIPATION WE HAD NOT

00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.293
PROVIDER SURVEY WE HAD ABOUT

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.795
ELEVEN HUNDRED VENDORS SUBMIT A

ADDITION TO THE VENDOR SURVEY

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:07.299
WE CONDUCTED AN INDIVIDUAL

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:08.701
FAMILY SURVEY ACTUALLY THROUGH

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.336
ONE OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS ON

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.670
THIS PARTICULAR ENGAGEMENTS THE

HUMAN SERVICES RESEARCH

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.406
INSTITUTE. AND THAT WAS

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.075
DESIGNED TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:16.909
AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.577
IMPORTANT TO INDIVIDUALS AND

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.978
FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE SYSTEM SO

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.280
WASN'T DESIGNED TO CAPTURE

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.215
COSTA DATA SO TO SPEAK THAT WAS

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:23.982
GATHERED TO THE PROVIDER

UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT THE

00:16:26.518 --> 00:16:27.886
VALUE OF THE SYSTEM WHAT THEY

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:28.854
THINK IT'S STRONG POINTS ARE

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:30.255
AND POTENTIAL AREAS FOR

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:33.892
IMPROVEMENT. RECOGNIZING THAT

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.794
PROVIDERS COSTS ARE DRIVEN MORE

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.329
THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY THE RACE

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.464
THEY'RE BEING PAID TODAY WE

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.699
ALSO ENDEAVOR TO IDENTIFY WHAT

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:41.867
WE CALL INDEPENDENT SOURCES OF

00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:43.502
DATA. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:44.837
I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT AT SOME

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.138
LENGTH DURING THE LAST TIME I

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:47.172
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.474
TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE. WAS

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.708
INFORMATION FROM THE BUREAU OF

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:50.843
LABOR STATISTICS WHICH

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.778
PUBLISHES. CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.279
WAGE DATA FOR A VARIETY OF

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.482
OCCUPATIONS. WE LIKE TO USE

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:57.683
THAT AS A INFORMANTS TO OUR

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.650
PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S CROSS

00:16:58.717 --> 00:17:01.086
INDUSTRY. IT'S NOT RELY TO JUST

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:03.856
ON WHAT DVD PROVIDERS ME DIAZ

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:04.556
FOR BITERS ARE DELIVERING IT

00:17:04.623 --> 00:17:06.091
REALLY LOOKS AT. I INDUSTRIES

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.426
THAT ARE COMPLYING COMPARABLE

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.795
STAFF. BUT IN OTHER SOURCES OF

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.096
INFORMATION INCLUDE VARIOUS

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.064
FEDERAL PUBLICATIONS ABOUT THE

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.599
COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.200
TO THE INDIVIDUAL STATES- WE

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.135
USE THE INTERNAL REVENUE

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.770
SERVICE'S STANDARD MILEAGE RATE

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:19.004
TO COST OUT TRANSPORTATION

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:20.339
RELATED EXPENSES WE USED

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.107
INFORMATION FROM THE- WORKERS

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.776
COMPENSATION INSURANCE RATING

00:17:23.842 --> 00:17:25.210
BUREAU TO. SET THE WORKERS COMP

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:26.645
RATES AND THE WRESTLING INTO A

00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:27.980
VARIETY OF OTHER DATA SOURCES

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:28.580
SIMILAR TO THAT AS WELL THE

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:31.617
IDEA WAS. TO MAKES THAT WE'RE

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:32.117
NOT CREATING A CIRCULAR

00:17:32.184 --> 00:17:33.252
ARGUMENTSWERE PROVIDERS COSTS

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:35.120
REFLECTIVE OF THE RACE ARE

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:36.755
BEING PAID TODAY SO. IF WE WERE

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:38.056
JUST CITY SIMPLY BASED. ON

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.425
INFORMATION WE WOULD.

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.492
EFFECTIVELY END UP IN THE SAME

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.361
PLACE WITH THAT WHAT WE

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:43.996
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE SOME.

00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:44.797
ISSUES WITH AT LEAST FOR THE

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:46.532
SOURCE CODE. THAT WE THINK

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:52.471
ABOUT THE ADDRESSED. ALSO AS

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:53.305
PART OF THAT GOT A CALL. PHASE

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:54.273
WE DID OF LOT OF WORK TO. READ

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:54.907
DIFFERENCE IN CALL SAYS

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:55.707
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM CAN. CAL

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:57.576
IS A DIVERSE STATE. AND SO TO

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:58.343
MAKE SENSE FOR US TO SEND A

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.945
SINGLE RATE THAT WOULD APPLY TO

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.914
EVERY SINGLE. REGION OR AREA OF

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.383
THE STATE. INTO THE AREAS WE-

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:06.185
FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR WERE

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.086
WAGE DIFFERENCES. DIFFERENCES

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:09.521
IN TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.457
DISTANCE BETWEEN PROVIDERS AND

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:11.990
THE PEOPLE TO WHOM THEY'RE

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:13.459
DELIVERING SERVICES. AND REAL

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:15.227
ESTATE EXPENSES. WE ACTUALLY

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.361
PUBLISHED A SEPARATE COMPANION

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.664
PIECE IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.631
NINETEEN THAT DETAILED EXACTLY

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:20.766
HOW DOES ONE ABOUT THAT SINCE

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:22.601
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.736
COMPONENT OF. THE RATE STUDY.

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:25.704
HAVING DONE THAT DATA

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.240
COLLECTION ANALYSIS WE MOVED ON

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:28.807
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF RATE

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:32.077
MODELS. BAND ONE OF THE KEY.

00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:33.178
COMPONENTS ARE ONE OF OUR KEY

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.013
PRINCIPLES IN THIS WORK WAS TO

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.514
MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:37.049
TRANSPARENCY TO THE GREATEST

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:40.085
EXTENT POSSIBLE. SO THAT RESULT

00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:41.787
IN ANY RATE PACKET THAT

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:43.288
RECESSED EXCEEDS NOW ABOUT

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.556
THREE THOUSAND PAGES BUT WE ARE

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.125
NOTHING IF NOT THOROUGH. SO

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.926
WE'D OUTLINED OUR SPECIFIC

00:18:47.993 --> 00:18:50.062
ASSUMPTIONS OUR DATA SOURCES

00:18:50.128 --> 00:18:51.497
AND OUR METHODOLOGY SO THAT

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:53.332
FOLKS CAN RECREATE EFFECTIVELY

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:55.234
OUT AS WE ESTABLISH THE RATES.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.101
AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE IT

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:57.236
REALLY HELPS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.804
THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS WAS

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.606
VALUE ADDED IF ALL WE WERE TO

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:01.273
SAY THAT WE THINK RATE OUGHT TO

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.542
BE. THIRTY DOLLARS. ON THE WE

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:04.576
WILL GET PROVIDER SAY THAT WE

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.011
THINK ARE THE THIRTY FIVE BUT

00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:07.713
WITHOUT ANY BASIS FOR-

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.248
IDENTIFIED THE DIFFERENCES AND

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.782
WHERE WE'VE WAITED WE REALLY

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:11.984
CAN'T HAVE. AND FORM

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.285
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER OR

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:15.888
NOT THE THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE

00:19:15.954 --> 00:19:17.890
IS MORE APPROPRIATE. AT SO OUR

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.391
PROCESS WE BUILT THREE MODELS

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.293
WAS TO BUILD A BASE RATE MODEL.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.461
TO SAY THESE ARE WHAT WE THINK

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.162
TO BE. REASONABLE COSTS ARE

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.998
DELIVERING SERVICES CONSISTENT

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:27.633
WITH THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:29.535
AN INDIVIDUAL SERVICE PLANS.

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:30.903
AND THEN FROM THERE WE APPLIED

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:32.137
WE CALLED REGIONAL ADJUSTMENT

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.171
FACTORS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.273
COUNTING FOR THOSE OUT FOR

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:37.142
MENTION DIFFERENCES IN WAGES

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:39.278
TRAVEL AND REAL ESTATE EXPENSES.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:41.613
WE DELIVER THOSE RATE MODELS IN

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.849
FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:44.416
NINETEEN THAT WAS FOLLOWED

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:45.150
SHORTLY THEREAFTER BY THE

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.119
PUBLICATION THE FULL RATE STUDY

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.186
MARCH FIFTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:49.988
NINETEEN. AND THOSE TWO

00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:51.557
DELIVERIES KICKED OFF A PUBLIC

00:19:51.623 --> 00:19:52.691
COMMENT PROCESS WHICH I KNOW

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:53.892
WILL TALK ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.894
LATER ON THIS AGENDA SALAS

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.428
PROVIDE A QUICK HIGH LEVEL

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.030
OVERVIEW OF. BUT AFTER

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.364

STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE WRITTEN

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:05.904
FEEDBACK TO US ABOUT WHAT IT IS

00:20:05.971 --> 00:20:07.839
THEY THOUGHT. WAS WELL DONE WHO

00:20:07.906 --> 00:20:09.308
ARE AREAS WHERE THEY THOUGHT WE

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:11.710
SHOULD POTENTIALLY LOOK TAKE A

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.277
SECOND LOOK ABOUT THE GIVEN

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:14.413
ASSUMPTIONS. AND AGAIN WILL GO

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:16.348
INTO THE RESPONSE TO THOSE

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:17.182
COMMENTS AND WHAT SOME OF THE

00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.084
CHANGES WE MADE WERE. IN A FEW

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.119
MOMENTS BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY-

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:22.588
THE COMMENTS TO RESULT IN

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.289
LITERALLY DOZENS OF CHANGES TO

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:25.324
OUR RATE MODELS PUBLISHED BACK

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.792
IN MARCH. AND RESULTED IN THE

00:20:26.858 --> 00:20:28.460
AVERAGE RATE INCREASING BY

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:29.795
ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT-

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.229
CERTAINLY SOME RATES INCREASED

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.230
BY A GREATER EXPANSE IN

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.065
RESPONSE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:35.167
AND SOME. INCREASED BY LESSER

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:36.635
EXTENT OR IN A HANDFUL CASES

00:20:36.702 --> 00:20:37.869
ARE ACTUALLY SLIGHT REDUCTIONS

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.404
THE RACE BUT OVERALL. WE'RE

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.238
LOOKING ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF

00:20:40.305 --> 00:20:42.774
PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:45.143
AVERAGE RATE. AND WITH THAT AS

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.645
THE DIRECTOR STAFF MENTIONED-

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:47.813
WE NOW DELIVERED FINAL RATE

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.281
MODELS IN RESPONSE THOSE PUBLIC

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.049
COMMENTS IN THOSE WERE

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:53.418
PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS MONTH.

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.286
WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:55.654
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.389
ABOUT THE RATE SETTING PROCESS.

00:20:57.456 --> 00:20:59.925
OKAY THANK YOU AND- WE WILL BE

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:02.327

BOTH THE COVER PUBLIC COMES IN

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:05.330
NEXT STEPS IN AND ANOTHER PANEL

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:07.165
I KNOW YOUR BACK YOUR FOR THAT.

00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:11.403
THE DOCTOR- SO BUT I DO HAVE

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.904
SOME TERMS OF YOUR METHODOLOGY

00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:15.407
SO FIRST OF ALL- AT THOSE

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.843
QUESTION LA BUT- HE SAID SO HOW

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:20.112
THE DATA THAT'S IN THE- MOST

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:22.481
RECENT. VERSION THAT WAS.

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:25.050
PRESENTED IN JANUARY. IS THAT

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.752
IS THE STEP HAS THERE BEEN

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:29.788
UPDATED- GIVEN. FROM THE

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.024
ORIGINAL DATA IN TERMS OF- I

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.892
UNDERSTAND WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.727
DATA THAT YOU WORKED WITH IN

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:36.328
THE BEGINNING SO IT'S ONE KNOW

00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:39.264
WHAT. DATA IS BEING USED IN THE

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:41.900
MOST RECENT REPORT. AND NANCY

00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.269
BARGE MEN- AGAIN MISTER POLICY

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:45.837
CAN GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:48.874
BUT AS AS NOTED THAT THE-

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.108
PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN THE

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:51.510
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME OF

00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:53.712
THE UPDATED INFORMATION THAT

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.447
THAT IS PROVIDED AS THE SOURCE

00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.916
OF THE UPDATED- GREAT MODELS

00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:59.718
AND THE FOR THE FINAL REPORT

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:01.720
THAT WAS POSTED AND SO. IT WAS

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:05.157
BASED ON THAT REGIONALLY ON

00:22:05.223 --> 00:22:05.824
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND IT WAS RE

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.526
BASED WITH UPDATED INFORMATION

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:08.860
FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN I

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.395
BELIEVE IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.797
CORRECT AND IT ABOUT

00:22:11.863 --> 00:22:12.931
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TWO

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.067
POTENTIAL- BLINDS OF

00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:16.902
QUESTIONING. THE RATE MODELS

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:19.137
THEMSELVES REFLECT WHAT WE

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.372
THINK A REASONABLE COT

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.074
ASSUMPTIONS AS OF JANUARY FIRST

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.142
OF TWENTY TWENTY. SO WHEN WE

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.610
PUBLISHED THREE MODELS IN MARCH

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:27.079
OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OF

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.914
COURSE THE IDEA WAS THE SOONEST

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.582
THE MOST OPTIMISTIC THE MOST

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:31.416
OPTIMISTICALLY THAT COULD BE

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:32.918
IMPLEMENTED WAS IN. THE FISCAL

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:35.053
YEAR AND NOW FISCAL YEAR

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:35.620
NINETEEN TWENTY AND WE CHOSE

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:36.221
THE MID POINT OF THAT FISCAL

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.091
YEAR. AND SO AS PART OF OUR

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:40.692
UPDATING THE RATE MODELS WE DID

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.960
LOOK TO SEE IF NEW DATA HAD

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:43.795
BEEN PUBLISHED IN OF COURSE IN

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:44.930
THE SPAN OF ALMOST TWO YEARS

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.498
THAT WAS THE CASE SO WE USE NEW

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:48.200
BLS DATA. WE USE NEW

00:22:48.266 --> 00:22:49.901
INFORMATION FROM THE W. C. I.

00:22:49.968 --> 00:22:52.137
R. B. WE USE THE IRS'S FINAL

00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:53.705
PUBLICATION FOR THEIR STANDARD

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:55.340
MILEAGE RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY.

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:56.308
THAT BEING SAID THE RIGHT MODEL

00:22:56.374 --> 00:22:57.876
STILL REFLECT WE THINK OF THE

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.978
COSTS AS OF JANUARY TWENTY

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.580
TWENTY INCLUDING BY STATE WHY

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:02.314
MINIMUM WAGE OF THIRTEEN

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.316
DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO IF THE

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:05.584
RIGHT MODELS WERE TO BE

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.052
IMPLEMENTED IN THE FUTURE YEAR.

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.120
LIKELY WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE A

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.020
LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:09.988
ASSUMPTIONS INFLATE THEM

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.524
FORWARD TO JANUARY TWENTY

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:13.158
TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:23:13.225 --> 00:23:14.659
OR AT WHATEVER STAGE. OF THE

00:23:14.726 --> 00:23:15.727
STATE WOULD CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:17.696
THE RATE MODELS SO THAT'S WHAT

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:18.964
THE RATE MODELS REFLECT ON THEM

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.632
AS THE DIRECTOR MENTION AN AS

00:23:20.699 --> 00:23:21.900
MISS PADDOCK MENTIONED IN TERMS

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:24.202
OF THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:25.937
THAT WAS BASED UPON ANALYSIS OF

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.606
FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:28.640
CLAIMS THE CLAIM TO DRIVE THE

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:30.175
RATE MODELS BUT IT TO DRIVE THE

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.977
FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS. AND WE

00:23:32.043 --> 00:23:32.844
TALK A LITTLE BIT WE'LL TALK A

00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.912
LITTLE MORE ABOUT THAT I THINK

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.347
LATER IN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.948
SOME OF THE UPDATES TO HOW WE

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.316
FORECAST THE FISCAL IMPACT OF

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:39.785
THAT ON YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.620
AT THE END OF THE AGENDA. BUT

00:23:41.686 --> 00:23:42.888
IT IS NOW UPDATED TO REFLECT

00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:44.356
CLAIMS DATA BECAME AVAILABLE TO

00:23:44.422 --> 00:23:47.659
US AFTER THE PUBLICATION MARCH

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:51.830
OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND

00:23:51.897 --> 00:23:52.831
AN YEAH I KNOW YOU CAN TELL A

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:53.565
LOT MORE PUBLIC BUT I THINK THE

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:55.467
SS DEUCE SIR IF THE STUDY

00:23:55.534 --> 00:24:00.405
ITSELF THE OF THE CHARGES FOR

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.474
THE STUDY WAS AROUND THE ISSUE

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.109
OF. BE SURE YOU HAVE AN

00:24:04.176 --> 00:24:06.144
ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF PROVIDERS IN

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:07.813
YOUR METHODOLOGY DEVELOPING THE

00:24:07.879 --> 00:24:10.282
STUDY HOW DID YOU TRIED TO DO

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:12.083
YOU DRESS THAT OR DID YOU TO

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.419
ADD TO. THE OP THAT ISSUE IN

00:24:14.486 --> 00:24:16.454
TERMS OF YOUR DESIRE. BOB YOUR

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:18.623
DESIGN AND OUT NOW THE RESULTS

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.759
IS A ARE YOU DID. STEPPING

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.228
ADDRESS YOUR YOUR MIND AS THE

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.063
PERSON WHO DID IT. SO IN MY

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.598
MIND WE CERTAINLY DID TRY TO

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:29.334
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT THE-

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.870
RATE STUDY DOES NOT. RECOMMEND

00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:33.572
OR SUGGEST A SPECIFIC QUANTITY

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.906
OF PROVIDERS WERE A RATIO OF

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:35.640
THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS TO

00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:37.342
INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING SERVICES

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:38.076
THERE ARE NO NATIONAL STANDARDS

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:39.845
IN THOSE REGARDS. IF YOU TAKE A

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:40.912
LOOK AT THE FEDERAL RULES

00:24:40.979 --> 00:24:42.714
AROUND ACCESS TO SERVICES IT

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:43.915
TALKS ABOUT THAT FOLKS ON

00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.550
MEDICAID OUGHT TO HAVE ACCESS

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:46.885
TO SERVICES COMPARABLE TO THOSE

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:48.553
ON PRIVATE INSURANCE. BUT

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.821
THAT'S REALLY CHALLENGE AND THE

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:50.989
X. CBS ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THAT

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:51.957
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WE'RE

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:52.824
TALKING HOSPITAL RATES ARE

00:24:52.891 --> 00:24:54.292
POSITION RATES BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.427
HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE FOR

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:57.262
HOSPITALIZATIONS OR POSITIONS.

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.597
THERE REALLY IS EFFECTIVELY NO

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:00.332
PRIVATE MARKET FOR HOME AND

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:01.600
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WE

00:25:01.666 --> 00:25:03.001
DON'T HAVE A STANDARD BY WHICH

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.469
WE CAN MEASURE ACCESS TO CARE

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:07.038
QUITE AS EASILY. AS WE DO WHEN

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:07.672
WE DO ACCESS TO CARE STUDIES IN

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:09.207
OTHER STATES FOR- YOUR

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:11.009
TRADITIONAL MEDICAID SERVICES.

00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.744
THAT BEING SAID WE ENDEAVOR TO

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.346
BUILD RATE MODELS THAT WE AS I

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:15.380
MENTIONED DURING MY REMARKS

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:16.915
WERE REFLECT ABOUT THE COST OF

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.650
DELIVERING SERVICES. SO WE TO

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:19.651
TAKE IN ACCOUNT THINGS LIKE

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:20.919
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND ONE'S

00:25:20.986 --> 00:25:22.153
RECOGNIZE THAT THE COST OF

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.321
LIVING SERVICES IN THE BAY AREA

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.689
IS DIFFERENT THAN THE COST OF

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.858
DELIVERING SERVICES. INLAND FOR

00:25:26.925 --> 00:25:28.526
EXAMPLE WE THINK THROUGH HAVING

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:29.661
RATES THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:31.329
THOSE COSTS THAT OUGHT TO BE

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:33.131
SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT AN

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.666
ADEQUATE SUPPLY PROVIDERS I

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.201
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. IS

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:37.168
WORTHWHILE CONTINUE TO MONITOR

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:38.436
OVER TIME AND CERTAINLY YOU

00:25:38.503 --> 00:25:39.771
KNOW THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.239
EXECUTIVE HAVE BEEN CRITICALLY

00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.607
INTERESTED IN DISPARITIES IN

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:44.576
ACCESS TO SERVICES. BASED UPON

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.511
DIFFERENT LINGUAL- RACIAL

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:47.412
ETHNIC GROUPS AND CERTAINLY I

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:48.513
THINK. IT'S WORTHWHILE TO

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.215
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT ACCESS

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.518
AS WELL AS ACCESS ON A

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:56.121
GEOGRAPHIC PERSPECTIVE. YEAH ME

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:57.289
MADE REFERENCE TO. SAY NO SIR

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:58.924
THINGS ARE. IF THERE. HAD

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.659
HEALTH CARE RELATED TO MEDI CAL

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:02.460
RATES AND WE HAVE WON THE

00:26:02.527 --> 00:26:04.162
LOWEST MEDICAL RATESIN THE

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.563
WHOLE COUNTRY AND I THINK

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.132
THERE'S A LOT OF. IN FACT MANY

00:26:07.198 --> 00:26:08.033
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.936
DELIVER MEDICAL SERVICES. GET

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.837
ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES. FROM THE

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.439
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO WHERE

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:17.175
DOES MEDI CAL RATES USE FOR

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.444
THOSE PARTICULAR SERVICES. ARE

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.613
WHERE THEY ADJUSTED FOR ACTUAL.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.515
PAYMENT AND THAT FULL PAYMENT

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.684
NOT JUST THE MEDI CAL RATE. SO

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.285
WHEN WE PUBLISHED THE REYES

00:26:27.352 --> 00:26:28.820

UMBRELLA UP INTO DEVELOPMENTS

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:48.406
AS YOU KNOW WE DID PROPOSED TO

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:50.442
TIE THOSE RATES TO THE RATES

00:26:50.508 --> 00:26:52.577
PAID ON UNDER THE MEDICARE FEE

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:53.945

ANOTHER PROGRAM AT THE MUCH

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.188
SMALLER PROGRAM. HERE IN

PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.094
METHODOLOGY WAS WITHDRAWN AND

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:09.928
RATHER THAN TIME RATES TO THE

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.096
MEDI CAL FEE FOR SERVICE

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:12.831
SCHEDULE WE DID ACTUALLY

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:15.166
DEVELOP RATE MODELS FOR- THOSE

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:16.134
THAT HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:17.335
PROPOSED TO BE TIED SO THERE

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:18.436
ARE NOW RATE MODELS FOR

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.337
SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.672
SERVICES TO LIVE UNDER SERVICE

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:22.674
CODES ONE FIFTEEN ONE SIXTEEN

00:27:22.741 --> 00:27:24.275
ONE SEVENTEEN. ADAPTIVE SKILLS

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:25.143
TRAINING AND INFILL DEVELOPMENT

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:26.611
SERVICES THEIR INDEPENDENCE OF

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:30.582
THE MEDI CAL RATES. OKAY

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.851
BECAUSE I MEAN I THINK. TALK

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:35.620
ABOUT CIRCULAR. RIGHT NOW ARMS

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:36.821
ARE MEDICAL RATES ARE NOT BASED

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:38.857
ON MARKET IS THERE IN FACT-

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:40.291
THERE'S ACTION EXPECTATION THAT

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.126
PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:44.929
SERVICES ARE SUBSIDIZED- FROM

00:27:44.996 --> 00:27:45.730
REIMBURSES THEY'RE GETTING FROM

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:48.333
COMMERCIAL OR THEY ARE CLINICS

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.437
THAT CAN GET YOU KNOW AGAIN-

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:53.538
PROTECTED PAYMENT THERE ARE

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:55.206
OTHER TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS-

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.307
THAT THAT ACTUALLY NHANCE

00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:58.209
THEIR REIMBURSEMENT SO SOON IS

00:27:58.276 --> 00:27:59.778
THE CHAIR SUBCOMMITTEE OVERSEES

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:01.546
MEDI CAL QUITE AWARE. AND ALSO

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:02.947
AS A MEDICAL PROVIDER IS A

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:06.217
PEDIATRICIAN- SO LET THE SO I

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:07.519
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE NO

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:10.221
TO THOSE THINGS- WHEN IT COMES

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.156
TO IN TERMS OF YOU SAID YOU

00:28:11.222 --> 00:28:17.662
DEVELOP THESE RATE MODELS. HOW

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:19.330
SO WITH IT LIKE A ONE IS ISSUES

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:22.200
THAT- ALSO LOOKING AT WAS THE

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:24.302
STATS- TRYING TO RATIONALIZE

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:26.071
THE PAYMENT SYSTEM AS WE HEARD

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:29.474
FROM OHIO IT'S A IT'S A- SO

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.243
WHAT KIND OF WORK DID YOU DO SO

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.912
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE VARIOUS

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:35.313
METHODOLOGIES TRY TO COME UP

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.815
WITH THE AMOUNTS AND SO FORTH

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.683
BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY TRYING

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.218
TO BETTER RATIONALIZE THE

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:42.353
PAYMENT SYSTEM IN THESE-

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.289
WORKING CAN YOU DESCRIBE ABOUT

00:28:44.355 --> 00:28:49.327
THE- HOW HE CAME ABOUT- DOES

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.262
SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS. SHORT SO

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:52.430
I THINK THE REALLY TWO PRIMARY

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:54.199
THINGS THAT WE SOUGHT TO DO IN

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.266
RESPONSE THAT PARTICULAR

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.168
REQUIREMENT A. B. X. TWO ONE.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.670
FUNDAMENTALLY WE DID WANT TO

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.271
ESTABLISH RATES THAT ENSURE

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.539
THAT PROVIDERS DELIVERING THE

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:03.274
SAME SERVICE WITHIN THE SAME

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:04.976
REGION RECEIVE THE SAME RATE.

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:06.111
AND SO HAVING SPENT A FAIR

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.445
AMOUNT OF TIME LOOKING AT

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:09.514
ACTUAL CLAIMS DATA THERE ARE.

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.416
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITHIN

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.550
A REGIONAL CENTER AND THEN

00:29:12.617 --> 00:29:13.751
BETWEEN REGIONAL CENTERS EVEN

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:15.019
THOSE THAT ARE A JOINING AND

00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:16.554
THE RATES PAID TO PROVIDERS. SO

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:17.422
THERE MIGHT BE A PROVIDER

00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:18.623
THAT'S DELIVERING A SERVICE AND

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.557
BEING PAID FORTY DOLLARS AN

00:29:19.624 --> 00:29:20.725
HOUR AND A PROVIDER IS

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.926
LITERALLY DELIVERING THE SAME

00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.495
SERVICE WITHIN THE SAME REASONS

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:24.596
BEING PAID TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS

00:29:24.662 --> 00:29:26.498
PER HOUR. SO THE MOVEMENT TO

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:27.765
STANDARDIZE BE SCHEDULE WOULD

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.367
ENSURE THAT A MORE LEVEL

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.035
PLAYING FIELD FOR VENDORS

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:32.737
ACROSS THE STATE NOW AGAIN WE

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:33.638
ON THE STATE WIDE RATE BECAUSE

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.173
AS I MENTIONED IN AS EVERYONE

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.341
ACKNOWLEDGES THE TOSS IN THE

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.208
BAY AREA ARE DIFFERENT ON THE

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:38.843
COST. MORE INLAND SO THAT WAS

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.078
THAT THE FIRST THING WE WANTED

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:41.880
TO DO WAS TO- INSURE MORE

00:29:41.946 --> 00:29:43.081
PARITY AND THERE'S COURT

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:44.816
REASONS WHY THESE THINGS HAVE

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.217
TRANSPIRED OVER TIME IN TERMS

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.085
OF THE RATE FREEZE IS WHEN

00:29:47.152 --> 00:29:47.852
PEOPLE BEGAN DELIVERING

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.587
SERVICES SO. THAT'S NOT MEANT

00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:51.356
AS A NET CRITICISM NECESSARILY

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:52.323
BUT JUST NOT SURVEYS AND THERE

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.359
WAS A LOT OF INEQUITY. IN THE

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.460
SYSTEM AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:57.028
THE STANDARDIZED RATES IS

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.763
INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT SOME

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.667
OF TO. CREATE A MORE RATIONAL

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:05.403
SYSTEM. BUT THAT THE RATES OF

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.237
THE- INCLUDE AND STILL

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:06.971
CONTINUES TO INCLUDE ALTHOUGH

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:07.739
PER. NOT TO. THE SAME DEGREE

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.140
WHAT. MORE APPROPRIATE. SOME

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.576
SERVE CODES CALIFORNIA HAS FROM

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.578
AND IT SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE ONE

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:16.014
THE MORE COMPLEX- SERVICE

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.216
DELIVERY SYSTEMS- IN TERMS OF

00:30:18.283 --> 00:30:19.217
THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:20.318
SERVICES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:21.052
AND SOUGHT THAT. OTHER STATES

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.453
ARE PROVIDING SIMILAR SUPPORTS

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.655
BUT THEY'RE DOING IT UNDER A

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.456
PATIENT'S LESTER NUMBER OF SORT

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:26.457
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL SERVICE

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:28.593
CODE SO. WHERE APPROPRIATE WE

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.394
DID LOOK TO COLLAPSE SERVICE

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.162
CLOSER- SEEKING TO ACCOMPLISH A

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:32.797
SIMILAR TASK INTO A SINGLE

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:34.098
SERVICE CODE SO WE DON'T HAVE.

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:36.534
PAID A SITUATION WHERE. AGAIN

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:37.902
WE HAVE TO PROVIDERS DOING

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:38.903
EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING I

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:39.637
WANT PROVIDERS DOING IT UNDER

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:43.107
SERVICE CUTBACKS IN ANOTHER

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.309
PROVIDERS DOING UNDER SERVICE

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:45.810
CALLED WHY IT MADE SENSE THAT A

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:50.815
FOUR DOOR. BUT IT. THIS CODE.

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:55.119
ACTIVITY IN JEW SO IT'S CONCEPT

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.854
OF BASED BUDGETING AND WAS THAT

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:58.323
CAN OUR COURT IN DEVELOPING THE

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:03.294
RIGHT MODELS. BUT FOR THE YEAH

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:04.996
SO REGARDING EXPLORING

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:07.398
ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF PAYMENT-

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:08.333
THOSE ARE CONTINUE

00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:10.368
CONVERSATIONS TO THIS IS THE

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:11.869
THAT WAS A ROCK SIDES EYES

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.171
ENCLAVE IN TERMS OF FLEX INTO

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:14.639
ALL IN THE CURRENT RATE STUDY

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:15.773
YEAH  WAS ALSO TAKING A LOOK

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.209
AT YOU KNOW WITHIN- AND AS

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:19.978
MISTER PULASKI HAD IDENTIFIED

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.646
THE FEE FOR SERVICE- SO IT

00:31:21.713 --> 00:31:23.781
WASN'T ATTACHED TO THEN. OKAY

00:31:23.848 --> 00:31:25.149
TO SERVICE OUTCOMES

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.217
SPECIFICALLY AND SO THOSE ARE

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:27.986
THAT CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS TO

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.120
HAVE OKAY SO IT WILL WILL GET

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.555
BACK TO THEM THEY'LL PADS

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:31.522
WONDERING TO WHAT DEGREE WAS

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:33.491
THAT DO DEAL WITH IT'S YOU WERE

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:34.993
DEVELOPING THIS THIS STUDY

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:37.295
THAT'S PRESENT A WEEK YEAH YEAH

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.630
THANK YOU WE WHAT WE DID DO IS

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:40.898
THAT WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:42.600
OTHER HELP OTHER STATES ARE HOW

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.535
OTHER. SYSTEMS HAVE AN APPROACH

00:31:44.602 --> 00:31:46.738
IN DELAY OF PAYMENT MODELS OKAY

00:31:46.804 --> 00:31:48.373
AND SO CONSIDERING ALL OF THE

00:31:48.439 --> 00:31:50.375
FACTORS IN CONSIDERING KIND OF

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.376
THE PRIORITIES WITHIN THE RATE

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:52.877
STUDY THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:53.611
WERE WERE VIEWED AND BY YOU

00:31:53.678 --> 00:32:00.051
WAITED. ON ANYTHING IT JUST. A

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:02.253
SOUND TO DIRECTOR MARGINS FROM.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.022
AS SHE NO WE DON'T HAVE. A SET

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.290
OF AT THE FOR BUT OUTCOMES THE

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:06.424
NOT TIE PAYMENTS THOSE OUT. BUT

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:09.060

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.210

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:14.759
A LOT TO PROXIMALLY FIVE HOURS

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.027
PER WEEK OF DRIVE TIME THREE

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:17.528
HUNDRED MINUTES. THAT'S TEAM

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.463
MINUTES PER VISIT IF WE STAY

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.232
WITH THEIR TWENTY THREE VISITS

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:24.301
PER WEEK. WHICH IN OUR WORLD

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:25.770
COUNTY IS NOT DOABLE AND IT'S

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:28.673
ALMOST LIKE A BOY. SANDERS STE.

00:38:28.739 --> 00:38:30.541
I'M IT. VERSUS VERY VERY

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.509
COMPLICATED. BUT COMPLICATED

00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:32.843
NOT MEAN BROKEN IT MEANS THAT

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.811
WORKING WITH INFANTS AND

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.546
TODDLERS IS NEW ONES. AND IT

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.214
TAKES MORE TIME IN REALITY THAT

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:40.317
ON PAPER. ANY PARENT WHO'S EVER

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:40.951
TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE DOOR IN

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:41.519
THE MORNING WITH A TODDLER

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:43.220
KNOWS THIS. AND EVERYTHING

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.388
TAKES LONGER THAN WE THINK IT

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.691
WELL. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:48.125
FOR US IS THE PROPOSED RATES

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:50.394
OCCUR IS A CRISIS SORRY ANOTHER

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:51.896
SICK NEED ISSUES AT THE

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.364
PROPOSED RATES. IS IT ACROSS

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:54.965
THE BOARD ADMINISTRATION COSTS

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.134
ALLOWANCE OF TWELVE PERCENT. I

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.269
RUN A PRETTY TIGHT SHIP AND I

00:38:58.335 --> 00:38:59.737
STILL CAN'T GET OUR ADMIN COSTS

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:02.406
DOWN BELOW FIFTEEN PERCENT. AND

00:39:02.473 --> 00:39:04.075
MORE TYPICALLY IT'S 18%

00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:05.076
LIABILITY AND PROPERTY

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:07.611
INSURANCE WENT UP ALMOST 56%

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.413
FOR US FROM NINETY TWO THOUSAND

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.581
AND NINETEEN TO TWO THOUSAND

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:11.882
AND TWENTY. DUE PRIMARILY TO

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.484
THE CONTINUING NATURAL

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:15.886
DISASTERS IN OUR AREA. WORKERS

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.022
COMP WENT UP 40% OVER THE PAST

00:39:18.089 --> 00:39:19.790
TWO YEARS RENT GOES UP 3% A

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.859
YEAR IF. I COULD GO ON. WHEN I

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:23.027
LOOK AT THIS PERCENTAGE AND I

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:23.894
LOOK AT THE DAILY OPERATION

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.563
COST OF TEN DOLLARS PER DAY PER

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.630
FULL TIME EARLY INTERVENTION

00:39:26.697 --> 00:39:28.032
SPECIALIST I WONDER HOW LONG

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:30.634
AGENCIES LIKE MINE WILL SURVIVE.

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.603
ANY FROM SINGLE SINGULAR

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.971
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO THE

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.206
REGIONAL CENTER WILL BE THE

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:36.807
ONLY SERVICE PROVIDERS LEFT.

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.242
WHO CAN AFFORD TO WORK ON AT

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:40.344
THE PROPOSED RATES. IT MIGHT

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.645
SAVE MONEY BUT I BELIEVE IF WE

00:39:41.712 --> 00:39:43.414
LET THIS HAPPEN WE WILL BE LEFT

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:44.515
WITH THE SYSTEM OF FRAGMENTED

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:46.250
UNSUPERVISED AN UNSUPPORTED

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.319
PROFESSIONALS. A LITTLE QUALITY

00:39:48.385 --> 00:39:49.920
CONTROL ONE MORE THING. THE

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:50.788
RATE REFORM COMMITTEE DID A

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:52.223
TREMENDOUS JOB AND THE

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.624
CONSULTANTS PROVIDED US ALL

00:39:53.691 --> 00:39:54.959
WITH THE BASIC ROAD MAP. BUT

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:57.061
NOW THAN MATT NEEDS WORK AND I

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.295
BELIEVE IT NEEDS WORK FROM THE

00:39:58.362 --> 00:39:59.230
PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW THEIR

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:02.233
OWN TERRITORY ONE SUBCOMMITTEE

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.033
THIS GOING TO DEAL WITH THE

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.401
WHOLE SYSTEM OF CARE I DON'T

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:05.803
BELIEVE CAN COME WITH UP WITH A

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.671
QUICK IMPLEMENTATION SYSTEM.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.807
BUT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SO

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:11.041
I'M PROPOSING THAT YOU THINK

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.610
ABOUT. IMPLEMENTATION

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.678
SUBCOMMITTEES BASED ON THE

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.814
SERVICE DELIVERY PROFESSIONALS

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:19.116
IN THAT SYSTEM THE LEARNING

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:21.552
CURVE WOULD BE LESS STEEP. OKAY

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:22.620
THANK YOU AND AGAIN WILL HAVE

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.455

THE TRANSPARENCY THROUGHOUT THE

PROCESS. THE RATE STUDY IS A

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.573
FAIR IS FAIRLY SOLID IN IN

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.974
ALIGNMENT WITH HOME AND

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:19.176
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. THIS

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.611
REPORT DOES DOCUMENTED DEFICIT

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.146
IN FUNDING OF COMMUNITY BASED

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:24.648
SERVICES OF ONE POINT EIGHT

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.250
BILLION DOLLARS I DO WANT TO

THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.086
LEGISLATOR FOR RECOGNIZING THE

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:32.790
IMPORTANCE. AND MAKING AN

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:33.357
INITIAL INVESTMENT INTO THE

00:41:33.424 --> 00:41:34.925
SYSTEM. WELL WE COULD USE THIS

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.160
HEARING TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.596
OF THE STUDY I BELIEVE. WE MUST

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:41.098
INSIST- WE MUST INSTEAD DISCUSS

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.433
THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING A

00:41:42.499 --> 00:41:44.735
COMMITMENT TO BEGIN PROVIDING

00:41:44.802 --> 00:41:46.737
THESE NEEDED RESOURCES. WHAT WE

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.372
KNOW WAS MORE THAN EIGHTY CENTS

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.107
OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT FOR

00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:51.709
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES GOES

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:52.776
DIRECTLY OUT OF TO THE

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:55.079
WORKFORCE MOSTLY THE DIRECT

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.548
SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. THE RATE

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.617
STUDY DOES DOCUMENTED THAT MUCH

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.185
OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.020
NECESSARY TO SLOW DOWN THE

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:04.321
MIGRATION OF THE WORK FORCE

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:06.557
FROM SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS TO

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.392
WORKINGOTHER JOBS SUCH AS IN

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:08.959
RESTAURANTS AND THINGS LIKE

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:10.794
THAT. IT IS NOW COMMON

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.162
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TURNOVER

00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.664
RATE AMONG PROVIDERS IS

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:16.967
APPROXIMATELY 45% EACH YEAR.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:18.502
FILLING AND RETAINING EMPLOYEES

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:20.170
TO SPEAK TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:21.772
SAFELY WHILE MEETING THE

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:22.773
REQUIREMENTS OF HOME AND

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.875
COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IS A

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:26.610
DAILY STRUGGLE FOR PROVIDERS.

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.479
MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE

00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.281
ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATOR

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.815
EXCEPT AND ACT UPON THE RATE

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.118
STUDY CONCLUSION. THAT A MAJOR

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.253
INVESTMENT IS NECESSARY AND

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.588
THAT WE FOCUS THOSE RESOURCES

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.890
ON REBUILDING OUR SYSTEM. IT IS

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:42.092
IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:43.727
THIS REFORM WILL NOT HAPPEN ALL

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:45.129
RIGHT. NEEDS TO BE A FULL

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:47.398
PROCESS. FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:49.199
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.201

THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:10.654
TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.523

COLLABORATIVE. I'VE WORKED

EXTENSIVELY ON THE STATE. A

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.795
RATE STUDY AND BELIEVE IT'S A

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.664
CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS NEEDED

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:56.300
REFORM AND I WAS ASKED WHAT IS

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.836
MY OPINION ON HOW TO MOVE THE

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:01.305
RATE STUDY FORWARD. WELL THE

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.606

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:03.807
HUGE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:05.209
DOLLAR DEFICIT IN SERVICES FOR

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:05.909
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.444
DISABILITIES BUT IN SOME WAYS

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:08.879
THE RATE STUDY WAS THE EASY

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:10.881
PART OF REFORM. WE ALREADY KNEW

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.349
THE SYSTEM WAS EMBARRASSING

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.151
THERE'S ONLY UNDERFUNDED BUT

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:16.186
NOW WE MUST DECIDE HOW TO PAY A

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:17.955
NEW PATH FORWARD. AND CREATE A

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.990
SYSTEM WITH ACCOUNTABLE AND

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.026
MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. WE CAN'T

00:44:22.092 --> 00:44:24.361
JUST THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM

00:44:24.428 --> 00:44:26.296
AND EXPECT BETTER RESULTS. WE

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.065
NEED AND WE SUPPORT A STRATEGIC

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:29.666
PLAN. A PLAN THAT WILL HELP

00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:31.769
ENSURE MONEY GOES TO QUALITY

00:44:31.835 --> 00:44:33.604
PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE QUALITY

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.273
SERVICES. AND THAT'S OUR NEXT

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.641
STEP DEVELOPING CLEAR AND

PERSPECTIVE I MEAN THE AND THEN

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.656
THERE'S BEEN SOME STAKEHOLDER

FEEDBACK I PRESUME YOU IN SOME

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.425
OF YOUR- COLLEAGUES HAVE

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.897
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED SO WHAT

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:55.399
WITH THAT SO YOU DID MENTION

00:48:55.465 --> 00:48:56.566
ABOUT HAVING SERVICE PROVIDER

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:57.701
IN TERMS OF THE TATIAN BUT

00:48:57.768 --> 00:48:58.969
EVEN. LEADING UP TO THIS ARE

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.771
YOU SAYING THAT THE- CURRENT

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:02.139
RATES THAT HE'S STILL NOT

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:04.174
ADDRESSING THE FACTORS THAT

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:05.809
LOOK THAT STORAGE RESTING THE

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:06.476
ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP.

00:49:06.543 --> 00:49:09.646
TODAY I HAVE FROM WHERE I SIT

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:11.748
RUNNING AN AGENCY. I WHAT I

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:14.351
THINK HAPPENED IS THAT ONE THE

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:16.386
RATE THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.288
VERY VERY COMPLICATED. AND MANY

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.523
PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE EARLY

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:20.290
INTERVENTION- INDEPENDENT

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.025
CONTRACTORS ARE WORD BEFORE YOU

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:23.727
KNOW THE AB SEED WILL CHANGE

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.662
THINGS. M. AND AS AN

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:26.997
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IF

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.465
YOU'RE A SINGLE PERSON WITH A

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:29.866
SINGLE CASE LOAD YOUR OVERHEAD

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:30.801
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN AN

00:49:30.867 --> 00:49:32.669
AGENCY YOU ALSO HAVE VERY

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:35.305
LITTLE. OVERSIGHT IF YOU WELL

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:36.773
AND IN THE EARLY INTERVENTION

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.475
WORLD THERE'S A LOT OF

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:41.411
INDIVIDUAL VENDORS. THEN I'M

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.813
PROBABLY LESS SO THAN AGENCIES

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.581
THESE DAYS SO I THINK THAT'S

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.982
ONE THING IS IF YOU QUERY AN

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:48.385
INDIVIDUAL WHAT THEIR OVERHEAD

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:49.019
IS IT LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:50.354
AN AGENCY. WHO HAS A WHOLE

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.155
BUNCH OF. CALIFORNIA LABOR A

00:49:52.222 --> 00:49:53.757
LOT OF FOLLOW SO I THINK THAT'S

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:55.125
ONE THING I ALSO THINK PEOPLE

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.159
WHO FILLED OUT THE SURVEY

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:59.062
PERHAPS WERE NOT. IN MY CHAIR

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:04.935
OF BEING IN CHURCH PLEASE. I'M

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:05.602
VERY INTIMATE THE- RUNNING IN A-

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.170
THEY WERE. PROFESSIONALS WELL

00:50:07.237 --> 00:50:08.739
MEANING BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:10.640
HOW MANY KIDS CAN YOU SEE IN A

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:12.008
WEEK WHAT IS THE PRODUCTIVITY

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:15.112
FACTOR NEW LOOK AT WHAT A

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.680
CASELOAD IS VERSUS WHAT YOU

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:17.914
ACTUALLY COULD SEE WOULD BE

00:50:17.981 --> 00:50:18.882
LIKE ASKING YOU HOW MANY

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:20.016
PATIENTS DID YOU SCHEDULE IN A

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.785
WEEK BUT HOW MANY ACTUALLY

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.887
SHOWED UP. AND THAT'S A

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:26.289
DIFFERENT NUMBER AND I THINK

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.291
THAT THE RATE STUDY WAS

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:29.826
COMPLICATED ENOUGH WHERE VERY

00:50:29.893 --> 00:50:31.128
WELL MEANING PEOPLE FILLED IT

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.362
OUT AND DIDN'T ACTUALLY

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.330
UNDERSTAND ALL THE QUESTIONS

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.799
THAT WERE BEING PASSED SO IN

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:36.900
THE ROOM I MEAN BECAUSE THE

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.635
FIRST VERSION OF THE RATE

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.703
RECOMMENDATIONS IS VERY

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.537
DIFFERENT THAN THE SECOND

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.339
VERSION WHEN THERE WAS A LOT

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.775
MORE INPUT. FROM FOLKS LIKE ME

00:50:44.841 --> 00:50:46.676
AND HEAVY DUTY IMPOSED AROUND

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.311
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT SO I

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:49.146
THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:51.848
DISCONNECTS BUT I ALSO THINK

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:54.084
THAT- LIKE I HAVE SOME

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.986
QUESTIONS EIGHT IN THE FIRST

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.888
STUDY THAT AVERAGE

00:50:57.954 --> 00:50:59.589
RECOMMENDATION FOR PAYING AN

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.291
EARLY INTERVENTION SO THIRTY

00:51:01.358 --> 00:51:02.359
SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR THIRTY FIVE

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.360
DOLLARS AN HOUR AND IT WENT

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:04.594
DOWN TO TWENTY NINE DOLLARS AN

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:06.963
HOUR. YOU FOR USING LABOR

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.899
STATISTICS EXCITER HOW COME IT

00:51:08.965 --> 00:51:11.201
WENT DOWN AND IN SOME OF THE

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:12.702
OTHER FACTORS WHEN UP SO

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:15.505
THERE'S JUST SOME QUESTIONS. I

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:17.007
EARLY INTERVENTION IS A VERY

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:19.509
STRANGE SORT OF CAR ABOUT OF

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.611
THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IT'S

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.113
GOT A LOT OF RULES A LOT A LOT

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.247
AS A LOT OF WAY OF DOING

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:25.449
BUSINESS I AM NOT SAYING THAT

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:26.082
EVERYTHING ELSE IS IN

00:51:26.149 --> 00:51:29.653
COMPLICATED BUT WHEN YOU REALLY

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:33.056
LEAVE SUCH A CALM HATED SYSTEM

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:34.591
IN THE RATE STUDY COMMITTEE

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:40.030
THINGS. WHEN WE WERE OUR TO GET.

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.631
WE CAN TRY TO SEARCH OF PROVIDE

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.633
A WEEK BEING TO YEAH WILL GET

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.968
YOU THE BEST GONNA GET YOU GUYS.

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.803
THINK I. THE DILIGENCE BE OF

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.572
THE- I'D THAT CAN. DE A REALLY

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:50.207
GOOD JOB ESPECIALLY THE SECOND

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.175
TIME AROUND BUT I THINK THE

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:53.743
SYSTEM ITSELF HAS. SOME

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.946
COMPLICATIONS THAT JUST SIMPLY

00:51:56.012 --> 00:51:59.316
CALM WITH BABIES. AND A LOT OF

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:00.417
THOSE FACTORS WERE TAKING AND

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.718
I'M GUESSING I'M NOT THE ONLY

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:03.687
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HE THINKS A

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:07.090
12% OVERHEAD. IS NOT VERY

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:09.526
REALISTICIN THE CURRENT WORLD

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:12.596
WE LIVE IN. AND WE'RE A SMALL

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:13.196
NONPROFIT WE DO THE VERY BEST

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:16.333
WE CAN. OKAY OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:17.634
THE POLICY WISE WE LIKE TO KEEP

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.002
THE OVERHEADS LOS FACET LAKE

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:21.004
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:24.508
REASONABLE. DIAZ I MEAN DE LA

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:25.942
AND OUT OF THIS IS MORE

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:29.045
SPECIFIC TO EARLY INTERVENTION-

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:31.948
BECAUSE YOU ALSO SEEM TO REFER

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:34.518
TO THERE'S A TENSION ARE

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:37.053
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE AGENCY

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.122
FOLKS WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF AND

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.157
YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY HE

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:43.026
INDIVIDUAL OYSTER CONTRACTORS

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:44.394
OR RIGHT INDIVIDUAL

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.062
PROFESSIONALS DON'T THINK

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.230
TENSIONS THE RIGHT WORD I THINK

00:52:47.297 --> 00:52:48.732
THAT IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT OF

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:51.801
COST. RIGHT IF OKAY I FIGHT

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.637
HAVE TO PROVIDE AND WHAT IS A

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:55.005
REASONABLE FORTY HOUR A WEEK

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:57.374
JOB TO AN EMPLOYEE AND HOW WE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.875
BUILD CASELOADS AND WHAT OUR

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:00.110
EXPECTATIONS ARE WHAT OUR

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:02.112
SUPERVISION IS WHAT OUR

00:53:02.178 --> 00:53:03.980
TRAINING IS ALL OF THAT STUFF.

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.549
AND YOU THE INDIVIDUAL CAN DO

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:06.883
ANYTHING YOU LIKE AND YOU

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.486
AVERAGE A CASELOAD OF TWENTY

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:10.053
NINE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.755
WANT TO WORK YOU WILL WORK OUT

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.156
OF YOUR HOME SO YOU HAVE

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.392
VIRTUAL EXPENSES HAVE. YOUR

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.860
YOUR WORK LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:19.462
THAN AN AGENCY WORK IF THAT

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.197
MAKES SENSE OKAY BUT I GUESS

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.465
THAT A YES WILL. DO I GUESS

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.200
WHEN WE GET TO THE YEAH THAT HE

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:26.436
WILL SEE ME AT THE TOP OF IT IS

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:32.075
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE

00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:32.676
OVERALL WORK FORCES WERE THEY

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.477
ARE. AND WHAT AND THEN HOW DO

00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:36.012
YOU MAY. LESS EFFECTIVE YOU

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.248
KNOW USE OF. SO OKAY I AGREE

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:40.584
ALL RIGHT AND THEN- I THINK I

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.954
JUST GOT IT BUT- DISTRESSED YOU

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.755
TALKING ABOUT- IN TERMS OF

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:48.725
REFRAINED QUALITY- SO YOU SAID

00:53:48.792 --> 00:53:50.126
THAT THERE'S A- THERE'S AN

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:51.895
ABSENCE OF SERVE QUALITY

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:54.397
STANDARDS. OKAY TO DO CAN YOU

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:57.100
ELABORATE A BIT ON THAT WELL-

00:53:57.167 --> 00:53:58.068
WHEN WE WERE PREPARING THE

00:53:58.134 --> 00:54:02.105
DOCUMENTS FOR- STARTING.

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.340
STARTING OFF THE PAVE PROJECT.

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:06.409
I DID A- RESEARCH I ACTUALLY

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:07.410
FOLLOW THE REYES STUDIES

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:09.112
REFERENCES BECAUSE I THINK

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:09.846
THEY'RE RIGHT THE RATE STUDY

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:11.448
SAYS THERE'S AND- THERE'S NO

00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:14.317
CONSENSUS ON QUALITY. AND I

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.652
DON'T THINK THAT'S A FALL WITH

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:16.419
THE RATE STUDY BECAUSE THE RACE

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:18.321
THAT HE WASN'T RIGHT CONTRACTED

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:20.256
FOR THAT AND SO I STARTED WITH

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.725
THEIR ARTICLES THAT THEY

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.627
REFERENCED AND I. AND I DID A

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.261
NATIONAL SEARCH AND I CHECKED

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.397
IN WITH- STEVE AGAIN WHEN HE

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:28.498
PRESENTED HIS HE HASN'T SEEN

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:31.768
ANYTHING NEW- THERE. WHAT WHAT

00:54:31.835 --> 00:54:33.937
I BELIEVE IS THAT. TO SOME

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:37.941
EXTENT- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF.

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.709
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS ON

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.678
QUALITY IN THE MEDICAL FIELD

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:45.882
AND- AND THERE'S BEEN LESS.

00:54:45.949 --> 00:54:49.285
LESS METHODOLOGY WORKED ON IN

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.588
A- IT FOOD DEVELOPMENTAL

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:53.189
DISABILITY SERVICES NOW IN

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:55.358
TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE STUDY

00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:55.925
WE HAVE THE NATIONAL CORE

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:57.794
INDICATORS. AND THAT'S VERY

00:54:57.861 --> 00:54:59.729
SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT'S FOCUSING

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.598
ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN WE

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:04.634
GET TO LOOKING AT WHAT IS A

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:07.704
GOOD SERVICE. THE METHODOLOGY

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:11.207
TENDS TO BREAK DOWN. AND SO

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.375
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN ORDER

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:13.376
BECAUSE WE WANT TO CLEAR

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:14.678
STRUCTURE FOR OUR STRUCTURE

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.846
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAVE TASK

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.882
FORCE WHAT WE'VE- WHAT WE'VE

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:23.553
DONE IS. RE TOOLED- METHODOLOGY%

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.321
FOR LOOKING OUT WHAT IS A

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.923
QUALITY. DEVELOPMENTAL

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.591
DISABILITY SERVICE AND I THINK

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:29.592
THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:32.128
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- MEDICAL

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:33.163
MODEL WHICH IS LOOKING AT

00:55:33.229 --> 00:55:35.865
ILLNESSES AND DISEASES AND

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.700
WHICH IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:39.235
AND THEN. TO SUPPORT SERVICES

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:40.537
THAT DEVELOPMENTAL

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:43.707
DISABILITIES- SERVICES PROVIDE

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.408
THERE IS THE METAPHORS MORE

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:47.277
SUPPORT VERSUS CARE. ESPECIALLY

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:48.378
WHEN WE'RE GOING FROM AN

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:50.513
INSTITUTIONAL TYPE OF CARE TO

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.682
COMMUNITY. TO COMMUNITY CARE

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:54.651
AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:56.219
LOOKED AT WE DIVIDED UP THE

00:55:56.286 --> 00:55:59.022
SERVICE- THIS SERVICE DELIVERY

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:00.523
WE DIVIDE UP SERVICE OUTCOMES

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.758
INTO SERVICE DELIVERY WHERE THE

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:02.926
SERVICE PROVIDER DELIVERS A

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:05.395
SERVICE. AND WHAT THE- USER OF

00:56:05.462 --> 00:56:06.830
THAT SERVICE THE PERSON WITH

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.298
THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:10.433
WHAT THEY DO WITH THAT SERVICE

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.634
TO ACHIEVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.603
GOALS. THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.005
IN SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY TELL

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.040
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:18.608
DISABILITIES HOW TO LIVE WHAT

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:20.577
WE DO IS WE MEASURE IF THAT

00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.879
SERVICE. ACTUALLY HELP THEM DO

00:56:22.946 --> 00:56:25.115
THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.717
THINK WILL- GET THROUGH THIS

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.053
IMPASSE AROUND WHEN QUALITY AND

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.355
CAN FORM THE BASIS FOR VALUE

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:34.858
BASED PURCHASING BUT WE CAN. DO

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:37.093
VALUE TO A PERSON PURCHASING IF

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:42.699
WE KNOW. WHAT WOULD PURCHASE.

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.434
OKAY AND ACTUALLY. TOWARD END

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:45.001
THAT WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:45.635
THIS LEADING TO VALUE BASED FOR

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:47.437
SO OUT THAT THREE DIFFICULT DO

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.506
THAT BASE FOR. WE HAVE A IN IN

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:51.074
IN IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WE

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.542
DRESS UP A LITTLE BUT WE ALSO

00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:54.644
HAVE A FULL DOCUMENT THAT WE

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:55.712
SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.581
THAT YOU COULD- REFERENCE THAT

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.517
HAS SEVERAL PAGES ON VALUE

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.652
BASED PURCHASING. OKAY ALL

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:05.588
RIGHT. AND THEN- MISS ANDERSON

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.557
I THINK GUIDE YOU CHECK. YEAR

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.526
IN YOUR REMARKS CHIU FOCUSED ON

00:57:09.592 --> 00:57:13.596
THE UNDER FUNDING- BUT YOU ALSO

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:18.268
MADE REFERENCE TO THE- WORK. TO

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:19.569
IT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE- RIGHT I

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:20.937
THINK WAS IT WAS A PUBLIC. IN I

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:22.105
ALSO HAVE ABOUT AND WE'LL PRIDE

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.006
GET BACK INTO IT WHEN WE TALK

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:26.009
RESPONSE PUBLIC. SO IN YOUR

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:27.677
MIND I MEAN DO YOU TALK ABOUT

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:28.611
COMPETITION OBVIOUSLY WITH

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:33.783
OTHER TYPES OF JOBS- WHAT SORT

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.318
OF APPROACHES DO YOU THINK I

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:36.953
SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THE- ARM IN

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.688
TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:39.989
THIS. DON'T THE RED ONE THE

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:41.157
ORIGINAL CHARGES WHICH IS THE

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:43.092
WORK FORCE TO. SO THERE'S BEEN

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:45.195
SOME PEOPLE COMMENTING THAT WE

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:46.830
DIDN'T SUPPORT DIDN'T REALLY

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:48.031
DEAL WITH THE WORKFORCE ISSUES

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:50.033
AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE IT TO OUR-

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:55.038
DEAL WITH IT- SO. WHAT IN YOUR

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:55.638
MIND WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU'D

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.707
THINK THAT THE PART AND ARE THE

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.809
ARE A BURNS ISSUE SHOULD DO TO

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.544
BETTER ADDRESS THE WORKFORCE

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.048
ISSUES ARE ARE YOU SATISFIED-WITH HOW MUCH DATE. DID I'M

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:08.718
GUESSING IT AND SINCE YOU

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.653
MENTIONED IT BUT- THE- LA YOU

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.355
TALK THREE A FOR YOURSELF. YEAH

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:14.324
NO YOU KNOW I. THE OVERALL

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:16.359
STOCK I IT WAS SOUTH I MEAN.

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.994
THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS THAT YOU

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:19.562
KNOW FROM A PROVIDER'S POINT IF

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:20.997
YOU WERE GONNA SAY. WE WOULD

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:23.233
LIKE TO HAVE. IT ON OUR END BUT

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.168
I THINK OVERALL IT IS SOLID.

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:26.603
THE WORK FORCE ISSUE IS A

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:28.504
PROBLEM NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:31.307
BUT IT IS NATIONALLY. AND YOU

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.142
KNOW HIGHER WAGES IS ALWAYS

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.744
GOING TO. YOU KNOW HELP THE

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:36.913
SITUATION. BUT I THINK WE ALSO

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.348
NEED TO LOOK AT THE TYPE OF

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.128
WERE THE COMMENTS AND THEN

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:07.697
TAKING A LOOK AT THE APPROACH.

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:08.631
IN UPDATING THE RIGHT MODELS

01:01:08.698 --> 01:01:10.366
AND THEN ULTIMATELY THEN

ANSWERING A COUPLE THE

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.336
QUESTIONS REGARDING KIND OF

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:15.271
THAT THIS CALL PIECE TO IT. BUT

HOW PER SE REGARDING THE

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.042
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.843
HAVE IN THE AGENDA TO TALK

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:21.944
ABOUT NEXT STEPS TO WORK AT THE

SURE THAT I- RESPOND TO THE

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.385
SENATOR'S QUESTION REGARDING

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.387
THE CENTRAL VALLEY- A

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:34.590
REPRESENTATION. SO I'M WITH AT

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:35.158
ALL I'LL GO AHEAD AND HANDED

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:38.895
OVER TO. KLAUS THANK YOU CAN

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.631
RESEARCH SIMPLY WITH MISTER. AS

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:42.799
WITH THE OVERVIEW THE RAY SORRY

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:44.033
I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND A FEW

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.234
MINUTES BRIEFLY TALKING ABOUT

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.936
THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE SINCE

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:47.970
WE LAST GOT TOGETHER AFTER WE

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.705
PUBLISHED THE RATE STUDY MARCH

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.008
VERSES THE- UPDATE AND FINALIZE

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.376
RATE MODELS PUBLISHED EARLIER

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.611
THIS MONTH. AND SO THE PUBLIC

01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:56.412
COMMENT PROCESS WAS CERTAINLY A

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.947
LARGE PART OF THAT BUT THERE'S

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.382
ACTUALLY THREE COMPONENTS OF

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.917
CHANGES THAT WE MADE TO BOTH

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:03.352
THE RATE MODELS AS WELL AS THE

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:04.687
FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS ON. TAKE

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:07.023
BOTH OF THOSE ALL THREE THE-

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.358
SAME TURN. SO FIRST WE MADE A

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.060
NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL

01:02:11.127 --> 01:02:12.495
CHANGES IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:15.031
FORECASTING COSTS AND WILL GO

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.799
INTO MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS-

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:17.667
WHEN WE GET TO SOME OF YOUR

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:18.734
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AT THE END

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:19.502
OF THE AGENDA WHEN YOU'RE

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.070
QUESTIONS WAS ABOUT THE OVERALL

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.872
COST IMPACT AND HOW THAT HASN'T

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.773
CHANGED SINCE. WHAT WE PUBLISH

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.675
BACK IN MARCH BUT- HAS DRUG

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.343
DEPARTMENT ALLUDED TO EARLIER

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.145
IN HER REMARKS. THAT REALLY IS

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.447
A FUNCTION OF US HAVING ACCESS

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:32.181
TO MORE RECENT CLAIMS DATA.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.117
THAT ALLOWED US TO UPDATE OR

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.018
FOR CASTING TRANSIT THE

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.653
SERVICES THAT. THAT WOULD BE

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.955
THAT WOULD RECEIVE LARGE

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.323
INCREASES FOR THE RACE A MAN

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:41.324
COMMITTED ARE GROWING AT A

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.025
SLOWER PACE THAN THE STUFF. THE

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.827
SERVICE CODES. THAT WE GET A

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.362
GLASS. OF MORE MODERATE

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:48.698
INCREASE- IF THE RACIALLY WERE

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:49.699
TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO WE SEE A

01:02:49.765 --> 01:02:51.767
SHIP FROM- ONE GROUP OF

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.035
SERVICES TO ANOTHER GROUP OF

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.138
SERVICES. WE ALSO MADE SOME

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.973
TECHNICAL CHANGES TO HOW IT IS

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.574
WERE FORECASTING ESTIMATED

01:02:58.641 --> 01:02:59.475
COSTS MISCELLANEOUS SERVICE

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.145
CODES- AND THAT'S A TERM OF ART

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:03.813
THAT'S USED IN DDS FOR A

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:04.814
HANDFUL THE SERVER NUMBER

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.349
SERVICE BECAUSE IT DON'T HAVE.

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.284
A LOT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.086
WHICH POSES OF A CHALLENGE FOR

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.521
US BECAUSE WITHOUT A-

01:03:11.587 --> 01:03:13.122
STANDARDIZED DEFINITION OR

01:03:13.189 --> 01:03:14.190
APPROACH TO REVERSING THOSE

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:15.825
SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. WE

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:16.826
HAVE TO MAKE A NUMBER OF

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:17.727
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.128
AVERAGE RATE IS AND HOW THAT

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:20.730
WOULD CHANGE BASED UPON. THE

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:22.331
RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED IN THE

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:24.200
RATE STUDY. AND WE ALSO MADE

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.635
AGAIN SOME CHANGES RELATED TO

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.203
HOW DOES WERE FORECASTING THE

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.905
PERCENTAGE OF COMMUNITY BASED A

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.406
PROGRAMS THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.707
HIGHER RATES FOR HAVING A

01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:33.809
MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL FOCUS SO.

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:34.944
WE THINK THEY'LL BE LESS OF

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:35.545
THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.413
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. SO

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.248
THOSE MYTHOLOGICAL CHANGES ALL

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.683
RELATED TO HOW WE WERE DOING

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:43.019
THE FISCAL IMPACT ANALYSIS THEY

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:43.619
DIDN'T CHANGE THE RATE MODELS

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.821
PER SE. THE SECOND GROUP OF

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.324
CHANGES WE MADE TO THE- PACKAGE

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.158
WE DELIVERED BACK IN MARCH

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.393
WHERE WHAT I REFER TO AS

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:52.528
TACTICAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO ONE OF

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:53.696
THOSE TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS WE

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.231
TALKED ABOUT IN THE EARLIER

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:56.899
PANEL AND THAT SIMPLY COUNTY

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:58.201
FOR MORE DATA THAT'S BECOME

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.769
AVAILABLE SINCE WE PUBLISHED

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:01.571
THE STUDY BACK IN MARCH SO.

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.239
THERE'S BEEN NEW DEAL BLS DATA

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:16.285
TIME WE HAD ACCESS TO MORE

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.653
CURRENT DATA. WE WANTED TO USE

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.854
THE MOST COURT CURRENT OUT

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.556
AVAILABLE TO US AN UPDATE THREE

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:24.093
MODELS. THERE ALSO AT THE

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.895
HANDFUL OF CORRECTIONS WE HAD

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:26.929
TO MAKE TO THE RATE MODELS ON

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:27.964
THAT THREE THOUSAND PAGE

FORMULAE THAT WERE- ABRONIA SO

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.469
SOME FOLKS. SOME OF THOSE WERE

POINTED OUT TO US BY COMMENTERS

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.105

TO. WORK TO FINALIZE THOSE

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:40.243
REMODELS. AND FINALLY OF COURSE

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.010
WE MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.378
THE RAM MODELS THE RESPONSE OF

01:04:42.445 --> 01:04:43.746

CHANGES RESPONSE PUBLIC

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:55.024
COMMENTS WHICH COULD RESULT. IN

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:55.491
CHANGES TO THE MODELS

01:04:55.558 --> 01:04:56.859
THEMSELVES. I WILL GO THROUGH

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.594
ALL OF THOSE AS I SAID THERE

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:00.329
WERE LITERALLY DOZENS OF

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.063
CHANGES MADE IN RESPONSE TO

THAT WE RECEIVE WE- THOUGHT

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:04.286
ABOUT THAT A SECOND TIME AND

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.621
THEN. DECIDED PERHAPS WAS NOT

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.323
THE BEST PATH FOR TO

INDEPENDENT LIVING SO

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.731
PRIORITIZING KNOWS ADDING THOSE

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.833
INTO THE PROPOSAL OF THE

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.502
SUPPLEMENTAL RATE INCREASE SO

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.070
THAT IS PROPOSED ADDITIONALLY

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.571
REALLY GETTING SOME

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:50.539
FOUNDATIONAL WORK ON TAKING A

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.608
LOOK AT HOW DO WE TIE OUTCOMES.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.376
AND PAYMENT SO NOT ONLY DO WE

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:55.377
HAVE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF

THIS. I'M RATE JOE WE TO CA TO

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.324
.COM. BUT WE ALL NEED TO A LOOK

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:14.129
AT TO DO SIR TO RE CENTER ONE

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:17.633
THE WAY. OTHER STATES HAVE LONG

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.468
AT. IS THE AND HOW ARE WE DOING

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.069
THAT CASE CORD. AND THAT. THE

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:20.969
LAW COUPLE YEARS FOCUS BECAUSE

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.304
IT ON THE IMPORT WORK UP

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.039
OVERSTATE ACCOUNTED. AND WITH

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:26.108
REGIONAL CENTERS. I'M TO BUILD

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.644
ON THAT SO IN ADDITION TO OUR

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:31.046
REORGANIZATION IN ADDITION TO

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.781
SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:33.348
ALREADY BEEN DOING. REALLY

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:35.117
TAKING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.885
TO SAY WHAT ARE THOSE THOSE

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.887
FOUNDATIONAL OUTCOMES THAT

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:40.556
INDIVIDUALS ARE ASKING TO BE

01:12:40.622 --> 01:12:43.158
ABLE TO IMPROVE. IMPROVE AND

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.928
HAVE THE BEST QUALITY OF LIFE

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:46.729
AND THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.297
MEASURE WHAT MATTERS. SO RIGHT

01:12:48.363 --> 01:12:50.265
NOW THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL-

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:52.000
REFORM WORKGROUP I'VE ASKED HIM

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.135
TO REALLY FOCUS ON THIS WITH

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.603
US. SO WE CAN REALLY IMPLEMENT

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.739
SOMETHING IN A VERY TIMELY WAY.

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.107
SO IF WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE

01:12:58.173 --> 01:12:59.608
FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL OF

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:01.610
THAT PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE. I'M

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.345
PROGRAM IT REALLY IS GOING TO

01:13:03.412 --> 01:13:04.847
BE FOUNDATIONAL FOR US TO MOVE

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:07.249
THE SYSTEM TO A- ADVANCE THOSE

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.618
DISCUSSIONS. IN TIENE SOMETHING

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:10.719
THAT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:12.521
WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. WE

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:13.722
ALREADY HAVE THE PERFORMANCE

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.157
CONTRACTS THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.625
WORK ON. AND WE'LL TALK SOME

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:18.160
MORE ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW IS A

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.395
YEAH WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.597
BUT AGAIN THAT FOUNDATIONAL

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.499
WORK WITH THE SYSTEM AND FISCAL

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.900
REFORM DISCUSSIONS I THINK WILL

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:27.569
BE REALLY CRITICAL- SO. THEN

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:28.904
MOVING TO MAKING SURE THAT

01:13:28.971 --> 01:13:30.272
WE'RE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:34.376
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.179
I'M THE GOALS OF THE GROUP

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:37.780
REALLY IT WILL THEN BE HAVING

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:39.248
CON. BOTH ON. KIND OF THOSE

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.849
NEXT STEPS FORWARD GIVING US

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.985
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO AS WE

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.553
MOVE FORWARD WITH ANY.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.721
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.156
LEGISLATURE WITH THE

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.390
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:49.558
THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEN

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.627
ALSO WHETHER- STAKEHOLDERS.

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:53.462
THAT WE HAVE THAT FOUNDATION

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:53.996
FOR THOSE THOSE DISCUSSION

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:56.031
POINTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:13:56.098 --> 01:14:00.803
QUESTIONS. OKAY AND I THINK WE

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:01.904
STILL HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.907
HERE THAT I THINK YOU'LL GET TO.

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:08.710
SO NOW THE RATE STUDY. TO QUIT

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.180
THREE YEARS RIGHT AND- AND I

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.981
THINK IT. WAS INITIATED BEFORE

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:15.117
I BECAME CHAIRED THE

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:15.717
SUBCOMMITTEE AND JUST REMEMBER

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:19.188
EACH TIME. COME UP THEN WHILE

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.222
WE WERE WAITING FOR THE RIGHT

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.423
SAY WAIT TODAY'S RATE SAY NOW

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.091
WE HAVE THE RATE STUDY. AND I

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.426
GUESS WHAT ONE OF THE QESTIONS

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.428
IS THAT OKAY SO WHAT I'M

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:27.696
HEARING IS WE HAVE THE RIGHT

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:28.530
STUDY WE'VE UPDATED WE HAVE IN

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.666
YOU. KNOW UPDATED RATE STUDY

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.502
FOR. JANUARY ITS BENCHMARK FOR

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.938
STARTING IN JULY OF TWENTY

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:38.207
TWENTY RIGHT MID YEAR RATE

01:14:38.273 --> 01:14:39.908
THAT'S- THE UNITED

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.777
RECONSTITUTED THIS. TASK FORCE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.846
WERE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS.

01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.681
AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.583
ENGAGEMENT. AND THAT'S REALLY

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.652
IMPORTANT. BUT I THINK ALSO

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:53.322
HEARING THAT WELL. JUST BECAUSE

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:54.323
WE'RE TALKING DOESN'T MEAN WE

01:14:54.389 --> 01:14:59.228
CAN'T DO SOMETHING MORE AND SO.

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.363
A SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.365
IS THAT SO WHAT ARE WE DOING IN

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:05.434
TERMS OF ACTUALLY TRYING TO

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.236
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE PAYMENT

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:10.505
MODELS ALSO MADE MENTION NOW

01:15:10.572 --> 01:15:11.907
AND AGAIN I WANT RECOGNIZE THAT

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:13.508
THE THIS BUDGET IS THAT THE IN

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:16.812
DOLLAR OR MORE THIS YEAR THAN.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.914
LAST YEAR SO I MIKE KNOWLEDGE I

01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:20.515
SAID THAT IN THE VERY BEGINNING

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:21.917
I THINK SIX HUNDRED SOMETHING

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:24.019
IN THE GENERAL FUND- BUT SOME

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.787
OF THAT'S MORE CASELOAD RELATED

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.155
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARY AND THEN

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:28.323
OF COURSE WE DO HAVE SOME SOME

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.892
TARGETED RATE INCREASES BUT WE

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.660
ALSO KNOW FROM THE RATE STUDY

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:33.128
THAT WERE ONE POINT EIGHT

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.364
BILLION DOLLARS SHORT NOW. WE

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.865
COULD BE RE STILL WE'RE TALKING

01:15:36.932 --> 01:15:38.166
ABOUT RESTRUCTURING SOMETHING'S

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:40.769
BUT LETS YOU TELLING ME THAT I

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:43.605
A WRONG I LIVE FEELING THAT

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.340
EVEN IN THE RESTRUCTURING AND

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:46.842
WE MOVED TO VALUE BASED

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.076
WHATEVER I'M NOT SURE WE'RE

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.511
GOING TO BE REDUCING THE

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:52.281
DEMAND. THE NEED BY ONE POINT

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.549
EIGHT BILLION SO HE'S SPEAK SO

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.886
WE HAVE THE STUDY NOW. LAST

01:15:57.953 --> 01:16:01.390
SPRING UPDATED YOUR HAD

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:04.459
PROVIDER IN AT THE YEAH PUBLIC

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:07.763
COMMENT IT CETERA- WHAT IS THE

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:10.065
NEXT STEP- SO I KNOW THERE'S

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.733
SOME BUDGETARY STUFF THAT I'VE

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.901
SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:14.536
AND WE MAY BE HEARING MORE IN

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:16.405
OUR BUDGET THANK HEARINGS BUT

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:18.173
WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S PLAN

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.541
TO START. AND THINGS SOME OF

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:22.411
THESE THREE ADULTS AND ALSO-

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.546
AND WE ARE FINANCE YOUR MAY CON

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:25.614
IS THAT OKAY I MEAN I SEE WHAT

01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:27.516
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING BUT IT'S

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:35.357
SEEMS LIKE THE- STILL. DOES IT.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.758
NOT QUITE CLOSING THE GAP.

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:37.426
RIGHT AND THAT THAT THE GAP

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.327
THAT THE DEBATE STUDY AND THAT

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.761
OF. AND EVEN IF DO REFER. MY IS

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.330
THAT NOT GOING TO CALL. THAT'S

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:41.964
GO TAKE CARE OF THE GAP EITHER

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.665
SO CAN SPEAK TO LIKE OKAY NOW

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:44.900
WE HAVE THE STUDY WHAT ARE WE

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:48.003
DOING WITH IT. I THINK IT THAT.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.105
THE RATE STUDY DID A NUMBER OF

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.974
THINGS FOR US AND IT IT'S

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.444
CERTAINLY OUTLINES- THE ADDRESS

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.779
THE AREAS IN WHICH- IT WAS

01:16:57.846 --> 01:17:00.148
ASKED TO DO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:01.950
ON THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR SYSTEM

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:04.353
TAKING A LOOK AT REALLY WHAT IT

01:17:04.419 --> 01:17:06.455
BUILDING A RATE MODEL THAT

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.690
COULD BE TRANSPARENT AND ALL OF

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:09.958
THOSE PIECES. THE OTHER THING

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.426
THAT THE RATE STUDY DID FOR US

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:12.995
IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.796
THOSE THOSE ELEMENTS OF IT IT

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:17.432
ALSO IDENTIFIED THEM IF WE WERE

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.034
TO IMPLEMENT THERE WERE CERTAIN

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.435
STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.637
HAVE TO REALLY EVALUATE AND SEE

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.638
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WHETHER

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:26.074
IT'S STATUTE REGULATION LOOKING

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.643
AT WAIVER YOU KNOW AMENDMENTS

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:29.978
WAIVER APPLICATIONS THERE'S A

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:31.146
NUMBER OF THINGS BUT THE OTHER

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:33.415
PIECE THAT IT DID IT REALLY HAD

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.017
US TAKE A STEP BACK IN ADDITION

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:37.285
TO. KIND OF THE COST OF

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:39.087
IMPLEMENTING BUT THEN WHAT ARE

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.655
THOSE TRENDS THAT ARE HAPPENING

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.657
IN OUR SYSTEM THAT WE STILL

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.693
NEED TO IDENTIFY IT TELLS US

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.894
THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.263
VERY CLOSELY AND TO OUR SYSTEM

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.831
AS I SAID EARLIER NOT

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:52.801
MINIMIZING IMPORT OF TAKING A

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:54.569
LOOK AT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:17:54.636 --> 01:17:56.304
THAT THERE'S SOME RELIEF

01:17:56.371 --> 01:18:00.475
CERTAINLY LAP AT. THAT WOULD

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:07.783
TAKEN THE MINISTER ALLEGE. TO

01:18:07.849 --> 01:18:10.519
OF. IT HAVING THE SUPPLEMENTAL

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:13.088
RATED. WE DOES EQUAL TO FOR

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.122
HUNDRED MILLION OVER TO. YOU

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.723
KNOW OF GENERAL FOR. YOU KNOW

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:15.624
HAVING THAT INVEST IS WAS A

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:16.625
STEP STONE. AT THOSE THREE TO

01:18:16.691 --> 01:18:17.993
SERVE CODES YEAR IS ANOTHER

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:20.062
STEPPING STONE IN IN AND

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:22.130
PRIORITIZING THOSE AREAS AS FAR

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.133
AS THE- SERVICES TO CHILDREN AS

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.602
WELL AS TO AN H. CBS COMPLAINTS

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:28.804
BECAUSE THE INDEPENDENT LIVING

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.705
SKILLS BECAUSE GET TO THAT. BUT

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:32.641
THE OTHER PIECES SAYING WAIT WE

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:33.842
NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:34.943
SYSTEM AND FISCAL REFORM SIDE

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:38.513
OF IT. AND THE PAYMENT- THE

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.982
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.951
WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS IT

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.653
REALLY IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THAT.

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.822
THAT DISCUSSION AND THOSE NEXT

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:49.257
STEPS AS WE'VE TALKED TO OTHER

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:51.793
STATES AS WE REALLY EVALUATED.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.395
AS FAR AS HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.197
SYSTEM CHANGE IT IS AN

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.798
ITERATIVE PROCESS THAT DOES

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:59.067
TAKE TIME. AND HAVING AN

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.702
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT A

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:03.171
VALUE BASED INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.606
RIGHT NOW THAT WE CAN DO WITHIN

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.942
THE REGIONAL CENTERS. REALLY

01:19:07.008 --> 01:19:08.743
DOES TAKE US A STEP TOWARDS.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:10.812
OUR NEXT STEPS TO SYSTEM

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:13.381
CHAINS- SO THOSE ARE THE STEPS

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:14.850
IT IS PROPOSED IN THE

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.051
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THOSE ARE THE

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:18.019
STEPS THAT WERE TAKING. BEING

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:19.154
INFORMED BY THE RATE STUDY

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:20.755
BEING INFORMED BY THAT PUBLIC

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.991
INPUT THAT WE'VE HAD AND TAKING

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.393
THOSE PRIORITIES- WE WILL HAVE

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.462
TO GO AHEAD AND APPLY FOR. A

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:29.131
WAIVER AMENDMENT IT WAS NOTED

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:30.432
FOR THOSE THREE DIFFERENT

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:31.833
SERVICE CODE SO IT WOULD BE

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.735
IMPLEMENTED- FIRST PART OF

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:38.106
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY. ONE FOR

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:44.279
THOSE THREE SERVICE. SO I GUESS.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:46.148

DOING THINGS BUT- I MEAN IT THE

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:58.727
PLANET A TIME LINE BECAUSE I

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:01.196
THINK- THAT THAT HELPS KEEP

01:20:01.263 --> 01:20:03.765

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.708
US TO BE THAT WOULD PRECEDE

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:15.177
HAVING AT TIELINE SAYING OKAY

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.245
WE YEAH WE GOT THREE STAY LAST

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.147
SPRING WE GOT PUBLIC AND CUT A

OTHERS RIGHT DIFFERENT

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.055
ACTIVITIES ARE INVOLVED IN THIS.

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:29.291
BUT WHAT POINT DO WE EXPECT.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.692
LIKE OKAY FINE WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:30.759 --> 01:20:32.260
TALK ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:35.463
WITH ABOUT. WHAT'S THE TIMELINE

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:36.965
FOR FORGETTING OF THEIR MAYBE

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:37.999
YES ADVENTURE WAIVERS AND SO

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.335
FORTH. SO WHAT IS THE TIMELINE

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.803
FOR US TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT

01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:45.674
TO GET TO- YOU KNOW WITHIN

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:46.708
SPECIFIC SPENT THREE YEARS ON

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:49.344
THIS RATE STUDY RIGHT- AND-

01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.078
LOOKED A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.546
THINGS AND THAT WE'VE HAD

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:54.316
ANOTHER. SIX MONTHS TO GET

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:56.284
PEOPLE TO GIVE THEIR FEEDBACK

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:58.220
SO FOURTH WE SHOULD SERVICE BE

01:20:58.286 --> 01:21:00.055
ABLE TO SKETCH OUT A AND YOU

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.089
SAID OKAY WE GOT THESE

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.023
DIFFERENT THINGS WERE LOOKING

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:04.626
AT AND I GOT I- IF PROCESS BUT

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.628
THERE'S GOT IT IS THE- THERE'S

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.862
GOAL OR GETTING TO AND I MEAN I

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.564
GUESS. FLAT OUT I MEAN WHO ARE

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:11.600
WE PLANNING TO IMPLEMENT-

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:12.901
REALIZING THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:13.902
ADJUSTMENTS AND SO FORTH MADE I

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.338
MEAN ARE WE EMBRACING THIS THE

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:19.207
SIZING OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO.

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:21.910
YOU KNOW GET- SOME VERSION OF

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:23.378
THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE PAYMENT

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.980
MODELS WITH THAT WHAT THE CODE

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.281
SO THAT WE A RATIONALIZED

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:28.416
PAYMENT- WE'RE GOING TO YOU

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:30.552
KNOW GET AIMED AT TRYING TO GET

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:31.519
THE AND WE HAVE ECONOMIC THINGS

01:21:31.586 --> 01:21:32.721
AT THE DEAL WITH THAT AIM TO

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:35.090
GET TO SOME LEVEL OF FLEECE

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.958
FULL FUNDING AT YOU KNOW IT

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:38.927
CERTAIN SOME POINT TIME OUT IN

01:21:38.994 --> 01:21:42.197
THE FUTURE- BASED ON- BASED ON

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:43.565
THE METHODOLOGY I MEAN UNLESS

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:44.566
WE DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:46.234
METHODOLOGIES CORRECT. AT AGE

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:48.036
THAT SERVE TOLD US WHAT WE NEED

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:49.004
TO AND SOME OF THAT WILL OF

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.939
COURSE BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.507
YOU KNOW. ADJUSTMENTS YOU MAY

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.842
MAKE YOU KNOW IN THE INTERIM

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.744
BUT THAT THERE IS THAT THAT IS

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.445
SOMETHING WE ARE SETTING AS A

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:59.781
GOAL AND AN DEL EX NUMBER YEARS

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.249
THREE YEARS OR WHATEVER I'M

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:03.218
JUST SELL EX NUMBER YEARS WE

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:04.219
PLANT WOULD GO TRY TO GET

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:09.124
THERE- I. SO I THINK THAT. IS

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.393
THAT SOMETHING THAT THE

01:22:11.459 --> 01:22:13.828
DEPARTMENT CAN CAN CAN CAN DO

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:18.066
AND PERHAPS PERCENT- IN MARCH I

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.301
GUESS IS WHEN YOU'LL PROBABLY

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:20.302
BE BACK UP AGAIN I HAVE THE

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:24.739
EXACT DATE I THINK. WHEN HE IS

01:22:24.806 --> 01:22:27.642
WORKING ON THAT. SEARCHERS

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:28.143
ASKING A TO DO A PLAN A

01:22:28.209 --> 01:22:29.244
TIMELINE. AND WE WILL WILL GO

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:30.912
AND HOW COME. IS TO

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.013
CONSTRUCTION OF WHAT ARE. THE

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.416
NEXT STEPS ON ON CONVERSATIONS

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:35.383
ABOUT THE SYSTEM IN FISCAL

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:37.152
REFORM YEAH. I MEAN I THINK I

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.119
THINK THE THINGS WE HAVE THE

01:22:38.186 --> 01:22:40.088
RATE STUDY AND I KNOW IT'S LIKE

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.456
I ASSUME THAT. YOU KNOW IF

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:42.691
WE'RE ALL SAYING THAT. THIS IS

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:44.392
GOING ON FORM WE'RE GONNA GO

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:44.893
FOR IT I MEAN I THERE'S

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:46.094
OBVIOUSLY OTHER FEES

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:46.761
INFORMATION AND WE'RE USING

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:50.732
THIS TO. TO RE LOOK AT HOW

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.233
WE'RE DOING THINGS AND HOW MUCH

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.501
WE SHOULD BE FUNDING AND SO

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:54.736
FORTH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.237
PLANNED FOR SAYING AND

01:22:56.304 --> 01:22:57.639
REALIZING THAT YOU'LL DETAILS

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.574
MAY NEED TO BE FILLED IN. BUT

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.142
WE SHOULD HAVE A TIME LINE OF

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:03.945
THE GOALS FOR WHEN WE HOPE TO

01:23:04.012 --> 01:23:06.247
ACCOMPLISH THIS OR IF THE OTHER

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.816
RESPONSES THAT. GREAT STUDY WE

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.217
SPENT THREE YEARS ON WE CAN'T

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:10.285
TO LATER THAT'S NOT WHAT WE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:12.120
WANTED THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:14.189
THAT TOO SO I THINK IT'S- BUT

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.390
WE'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS. THE

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:17.359
BASIS OF YOU KNOW THIS IS. THIS

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.327
EFFORT IS GOING TO INFORM HOW

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:19.894
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IN THE

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.797
FUTURE AND THEN. SOME BUT WE

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.199
HAVE SET A GOAL FOR SAYING WELL

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:25.767
THIS IS WHEN WE EXPECT. YOU

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.504
KNOW WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE TO

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:32.207
TRY TO ACHIEVE. YEAH SOME FIRST

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.976
OF THE STRAITS. FUND BILL FIVE

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.344
THAT WORD THAT'S WERE GONNA TRY

01:23:36.411 --> 01:23:38.646
TO. THAT MAKES SENSE. THE AND I

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:40.315
DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.883
RATE STUDY HAS INFORMED MANY

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.819
DECISIONS. AND SO IT HAS IT IT

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:46.087
REALLY HAS BEEN FOUNDATIONAL

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.489
AND KIND OF EIGHT MANY OF THE

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:48.390
DECISIONS HAVE BEEN ANCHORED

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:49.824
INTO INFORMATION THAT IS.

01:23:49.891 --> 01:23:50.592
GATHERED THROUGH THE RIGHT

01:23:50.658 --> 01:23:54.195
STUDY. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE-

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.397
SUPPLEMENTAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:56.731
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADDITIONAL

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.032
SERVICES AND THAT AND ALIGNED

01:23:58.099 --> 01:24:00.168
WITH- THE PRIORITIES OF MAKING

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:01.603
SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING KIND

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:02.904
OF THOSE REALLY KEY PRIORITIES

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:05.173
WITHIN- THE SYSTEM IN

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.941
ADMINISTRATION- AND THEN.

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.576
REALLY LOOKING OUT AGAIN THAT

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.577
THE PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:11.312
PROGRAM AND TYING THOSE VALUES

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.914
AND THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE IT

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:13.815
IS TIED TO THE DELIVERY OF

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.784
SERVICES AS WELL. YOU KNOW SO

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.918
JUST WANTING TO REALLY MAKE

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.086
SURE THAT THERE'S- A

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:20.822
RECOGNITION THAT- THAT THE RATE

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:21.923
STUDY IN INFORMATION THROUGH

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.158
THAT PROCESS HASN'T BEEN

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.193
SHELLED. IT REALLY HAS BEEN- A

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.694
PART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS IN

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.830
MAKING DECISIONS TO- SOME OF

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:29.998
THE IMPORTANT STEPS THAT WE

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:31.566
HAVE PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:32.934
BUDGET AS WELL. ALL RIGHT.

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:34.202
ACTUALLY IT MAY QUESTION FOR

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:39.274
FINANCE- SO. WE REALIZED. IS A

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:41.009
YEAR BY YEAR SAYING BUT ALSO

01:24:41.075 --> 01:24:42.010
AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR TALKS

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:43.411
DOES BUDGET TALKS ABOUT OUT

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:44.746
YEARS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.481
BUDGET WE TALK ABUT HOW YEARS.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:49.751
SO GIVEN THE RIGHT STUDY GIVEN

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:51.052
WHAT WE KNOW FISCAL YOU KNOW

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.520
WHAT THE STUDY AT LEAST

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:55.557
INDICATES THAT WHERE WE ARE- IN

01:24:55.623 --> 01:24:58.159
TERMS OF. WHAT THAT WHAT'S

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:01.129
NEEDED TO PROPERLY FUN. WHAT IS

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:03.064
THE WHAT SORT OF ASSUMPTIONS.

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.700
IS FINANCE USED TO PROTECT THE

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:08.303
OUT YEAR EXPENDITURES FOR-

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.805
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. IS THE

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.006
ARE YOU TALKING SO WHEN THE

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.541
GOVERNOR SAYS OKAY WE HAVE THIS

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:16.478
OUT YOU'RE GOING OUT. WHAT WHAT

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.646
WHAT WHAT WE ASSUMING AND

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.681
LOOKING AT THE OUT YEARS WHEN

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:21.783
IT COMES TO- THIS PARTICULAR.

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:22.684
SAID DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND

THE RE PLANNING ANY FURTHER

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.548
INCREASES IN THE OUT YEARS OR

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.182
WE'RE JUST. BASICALLY SAYING

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:28.983
WHAT WE HAVE AN INCREASE THIS

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.118
COMING YEAR AND THEN FOR THE

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.386
USER JUST STAYING THE SAME I

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.854
MEAN I GUESS THAT'S THE

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:34.822
QUESTION BEFORE THE EXPIRATION-

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:35.857
JACOB FOR WITH DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:42.697
FINANCE- THE FORECAST- THAT-

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:44.799
FOR THE MULTI YEAR. DOES NOT

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:48.336
REFLECT- ADDITIONAL INCREASES

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:51.439
BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN S.

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:54.609
ENACTED THIS THIS CURRENT YEAR

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:55.543
AND THEN THE ONES THAT WERE

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:58.646
PROPOSING- THERE ARE INCREASES

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.715
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF- CONTINUED

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.116
INCREASING CASELOAD YOU'D AND

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:05.153
UTILIZATION- AND ALSO THE

01:27:05.219 --> 01:27:07.388
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES. OKAY SO

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:08.022
THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT FOR

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:10.358
MINIMUM WAGE CASELOAD CHANGES

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:16.297
BUT NO OTHER OKAY. AT EIGHT SO

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:20.935
I GUESS. WE HAVE A STUDY THAT.

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:25.239
WE COMMISSION THE STATE THAT-SAYS WERE ONE POINT EIGHT

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:27.141
BILLION SHORT AT LEAST AS OF

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.677
ROUGHLY TWENTY THREE L. TWENTY

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:32.880
TWENTY OR SOMETHING- IS SO IS

01:27:32.947 --> 01:27:34.515
THERE BEEN DISCUSSION ON AND

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:39.721
FINANCE- ABOUT TWELVE. WE MIGHT

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:40.321
NEED TO CLOSE THAT UP A LITTLE

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:43.524
BIT. SO I WOULD ONLY KNOW THAT

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:44.926
THE I BELIEVE THEONE POINT

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.461
EIGHT BILLION DOESN'T REFLECT

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:47.795
THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:49.397
INCLUDED ALREADY SO IT SHOULD

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:51.799
BE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.667
THE DELTA IS THE ONE POINT

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:54.268
EIGHT BILLION MINUS THE FOUR

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.203
HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN ANNUALIZED

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.138
AMOUNT THAT WAS PROVIDED IN

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.106
TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. AS

01:27:58.172 --> 01:27:59.440
WELL AS THE THIRTY SIX MILLION

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:01.075
THAT'S PROPOSED IN THE TWENTY

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:02.276
TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:04.579
OKAY SO NOW I GUESS WE'RE DOWN

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:05.146
TO WHAT. ONE POINT SOMETHING

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.449
BILLION. LIKE ONE POINT TWO.

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:10.284
ONE POINT TWO OKAY I CAN. OUT

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:11.419
OF THEM YEAH. EXACTLY THAT I

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:14.422
THINK- YOU KNOW AS WE'VE-

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:16.991
DIRECTOR RODRIGUEZ DISCUSSED-

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.259
YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:21.562
SUPPORTIVE OF- EFFORT. TO KIND

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:23.031
OF LOOK AT. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.033
WE DO. IN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:29.570
THE SUSTAINABLE- YOU KNOW THE-

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.472
YOU KNOW. WE NOT ONLY HAVE THE

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:34.275
ISSUE OF THE- YOU KNOW THAT

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:37.645
THEIR- RATE STUDY THAT. SHOWS

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:39.380
THIS UNDER FUNDING BUT THERE'S

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:41.382
ALSO THE ISSUE. OF THE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.018
CONTINUED GROWTH IN IN. YOU

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.054
KNOW CASE LOADING UTILIZATION.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.189
SO WE REALLY ARE YOU KNOW I

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:49.557
THINK WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:52.593
FINANCE- OF LOOKING AT. YOU

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.561
KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KIND

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.096
OF START WITH THOSE THE

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.531
UNDERLYING. YOU KNOW STRUCTURE

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.633
AND SCHOOL REFORMS. THAT WE CAN

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:01.102
THEN YOU KNOW BUILD A VERY COST

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:04.238
EFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW- SYSTEM. ON

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:06.641
ON TOP OF SO. UNDERSTANDING

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.609
THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:11.813
SIGNIFICANT- INTEREST IN IN

01:29:11.879 --> 01:29:13.081
MOVING FORWARD SOMETHING AND I

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:14.115
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

01:29:14.182 --> 01:29:15.683
LEGISLATURE DID. COME TO AN

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.185
AGREEMENT LAST YEAR OR YOU KNOW

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.620
FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- AND I'M

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:20.855
SURE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:22.523
CONTINUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.592
OKAY WELL I THINK THAT-

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:26.194
INSTANCES AN INFORMATIONAL

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.730
HEARING- I GUESS- WE'RE NOT.

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:29.964
JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS COMING

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.734
YEARS BUDGET BUT- AS YOU. HEARD

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.135
MY CONVERSATION WITH DIRECTOR

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.370
MARGIN AND JOB I MEAN I THINK

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:37.672
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:38.973
WHERE WERE WE GOING TO WRITE

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:47.682
SO. AGAIN APPRECIATE. THE TO GO

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:48.583
DOUBTS THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:49.984
DOING THE APPRECIATE THE

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.853
GOVERNOR'S. FOR THE YEAR BUT I

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:52.820
THINK IN TERMS OF THINKING

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:55.256
ABOUT WERE WE GOING. FOR THE

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:58.459
YEARS OUT- AND WE CAN EVEN WE

01:29:58.526 --> 01:29:59.827
WILL TALK ABOUT THIS YEAR BUT

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.628
WE'LL TALK ABOUT FUTURE

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:02.396
HEARING- BUT IT WAS WORTH

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:06.100
THINKING. THINKING ABOUT. HIM

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.302
LET'S TRY IF LET'S THINK ABOUT

01:30:08.369 --> 01:30:10.772
PLAN FOR WERE WE GOING TO. END

01:30:10.838 --> 01:30:12.974
UP RATE- WHAT WHAT'S OUR GOAL

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.743
AND MY GUESS IS THAT ISN'T JUST.

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.078
THE INCREASE THIS YEAR AND THEN

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:19.447
STAY STILL RIGHT I MEAN WE HAVE

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:22.817
ON GOING WORK TO DO- TO DO THAT

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:25.253
AND- I THINK THE RATE STUDY

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.388
WHETHER WE FULLY AGREE WITH ALL

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:30.691
THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT. AND

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.160
THEY'RE PO CERTAINLY AND I

01:30:32.226 --> 01:30:33.094
APPRECIATE THE PART IS GOING TO

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.796
WORK- IN STAKEHOLDERS TO WORK

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.063
ON IT WILL TRY TO FIND MORE

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:37.098
COST EFFECTIVE WAYS OF DOING

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.168
THINGS- BUT I DON'T SEE US

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.235
BEING ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT

01:30:41.302 --> 01:30:43.104
ANOTHER ONE POINT TWO BILLION

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:45.573
THAT WAY. AND SO THERE'S THAT

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.542
AND SO I HOPE THAT AS WE'RE

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:50.678
LOOKING GOING OUT- THAT. WE

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:54.182
THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE- IN A

01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:55.716
MORE REALISTIC WAY PLAN FOR

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:58.319
WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- GOING

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:01.622
OUT. TO BE SURE WE MEET THE

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:03.090
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE I MEAN

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:04.492
THERE'S NO WE'VE WE'VE

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:05.693
ESTABLISHED CHAIRED THE LANTERN

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.628
MAN ACT. RIGHT SO WE HAVE AN

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:08.729
OBLIGATION THAT WE REALLY HAVE

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:10.798
AN LAW. AND SO HOW WE CAN MEET

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:12.233
THAT OBLIGATION ANY KNOW THAT

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.401
ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO DO

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:16.470
THAT SO- SO. I KNOW WE'RE NOT

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.340
GONNA DO IT ALL IN ONE YEAR- IT

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:21.843
BE GREAT IF WE COULD- BUT-

01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:24.011
LET'S. YEAH WE HAVE SPENT THE

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:25.279
EFFORT ON THE STUDY LET'S

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.781
FIGURE OUT HOW WE TAKE IT AND

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:29.217
THEN HOW WE THE OUTLOOK. IN

01:31:29.283 --> 01:31:30.918
LESS WE COME BACK AND SAY OH

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.119
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T LIKE IT

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.120
WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:33.921
WHATEVER BUT THAT'S NOT WHY

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.324
HEARING THEN. IF THAT'S SO AND

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.258
IT'S AND APPRECIATE THAT'S

WHERE WE WANT TO GO- WITH THIS

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:44.765
OUT AND SEND IT TO AND SET A

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:47.802
TIME LINE. FOR TRYING TO DO

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:53.207
THAT. WE ALL AGREEMENT ON THAT.

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.276
I SEE SOME NODS WILL CONTINUE

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:58.346
TO HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS IN TURN

01:31:58.412 --> 01:31:59.847
OKAY WELL AT THE I HOPE

01:31:59.914 --> 01:32:02.383
CONCEPTUALLY RIGHT WE ALWAYS

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:03.584

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.472

THAT WILL REQUIRE A WAIVER

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:52.506
AMENDMENT SO WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.440

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.044
WERE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE THE

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.045
ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.413
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCHEDULED

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.715
HOURS. VERSUS PROVIDED HOURS WE

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:15.282
WERE PRETTY CLEAR THE

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:16.283
INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE LOOKING

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.351
FOR THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF DRY

01:39:17.418 --> 01:39:19.787
CAT WERE PROVIDED. NOT

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:20.754
SCHEDULED WE HAD A SEPARATE

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.423
AREA WE'RE ASKING FOR WHAT THE

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:24.191
TYPICAL. A NUMBER OF

01:39:24.258 --> 01:39:25.659
UNDELIVEREDHOURS WERE SO WE

01:39:25.726 --> 01:39:27.027
HAD A DIFFERENT LINE REPORT

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.629
THOSE. THOSE MISSED APPOINTMENT

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:31.565
SO TO SPEAK. AND SO WHAT WE SAW

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:32.533
TO THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:34.768
PEOPLE REPORTING- I'LL BE ABLE

01:39:34.835 --> 01:39:36.236
TO DELIVER BETWEEN TWENTY SEVEN

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:37.771
AND THIRTY HOURS OF DOUBLE

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:38.806
ACTIVELY PER WEEK WE THOUGHT

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:41.308
THAT WAS TOO AGGRESSIVE SO.

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.242
CERTAINLY OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:45.279
LESS THAN IT WAS. TO THE

01:39:45.346 --> 01:39:47.548
PROVIDER SERVE AT. I DON'T

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:48.148
THINK I WAS DRIVEN BY THE-

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:48.716
BETWEEN AGENCY. IN IN THE

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:50.417
PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE DID THE

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:52.219
SURVEY ANALYSIS AND WE START IN

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:53.120
THE WEEDS ABOUT HOW DOES WE

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:54.388
APPROACH THAT BUT- WE'LL-

01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:55.689
CALCULATE BOTH WEIGHTED

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:56.957
AVERAGES WAITED BY THE SIZE THE

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.859
PROVIDER AND MEDIANS. HANDS THE

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:00.060
WEIGHTED AVERAGE IS NOT GONNA

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.061
BE IMPACTED VERY MUCH BY

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.062
INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS BECAUSE BY

01:40:02.129 --> 01:40:03.731
DEFINITION ARE NOT DELIVERING

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:05.265
AS MUCH SERVICES AS AGENCY

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:06.934
PROVIDERS ARE SO. OUR

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.369
ASSUMPTION AS RELATES TO

01:40:08.435 --> 01:40:10.471
BILLABLE HOURS IS LESS THAN THE

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.873
PROVIDER SURVEY CALCULATED BOTH

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:13.474
AS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AS WELL

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.676
AS A MEDIA. THE ISSUE OF

01:40:15.743 --> 01:40:17.711
ADMINISTRATIVE. RATES A

01:40:17.778 --> 01:40:18.679
SOMETHING THAT EXTENDS FAR

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:20.180
BEYOND THE INPUT ABOUT THE

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:21.548
PROGRAM AND CERTAINLY NOT

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:22.449
SOMETHING THAT WE DID GET

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:23.484
FEEDBACK ON AS PART OF THE

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:25.085
PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS IN FACT

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:26.286
I THINK I PROBABLY TALKED ABOUT

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.522
THAT. BACK IN MARCH SO THE

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:29.723
APPROACH THAT WE TOOK TO

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.625
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS TO

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.494
ATTEMPT TO TARGET. THAT

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:34.762
PARTICULAR COMPONENT THE RIGHT

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.830
MODEL TO CURRENT EXPENSES THAT

01:40:36.897 --> 01:40:39.700
PROVIDERS ARE INCURRING. SO THE

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:41.402
AGAIN WE GO INTO SOME DETAIL

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.936
ABOUT THE RACE CITY REPORT AS

01:40:43.003 --> 01:40:43.971
WELL AS THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT

01:40:44.037 --> 01:40:45.506
THE PROVIDER SURVEY TOLD US

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.174
THAT PROVIDERS WERE. OPERATING

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.675
AND ADMINISTRATIVE RATES UP

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.711
ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT.

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:52.146
HOWEVER WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:53.414
TO INCREASE THE RATES BY ABOUT

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.349
40% SO IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.117
THAT 12% IS GOING TO APPLY TO A

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:59.420
MUCH LARGER BASE OF SPENDING.

01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:00.053
IT GENERATES THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.157
MONEY. AS THE 17% DOES ON THE

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:04.525
LOWER BASE OF SPENDING SO THE

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:05.726
IDEA WAS WE DON'T WANT TO ADD

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:06.660
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:08.162
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BUT

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.997
EFFECTIVELY TO MAINTAIN PARITY.

01:41:10.063 --> 01:41:10.831
IN TERMS WERE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:12.299
EXPENSES ARE OUT NOW AS THE

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.600
RATE MODELS. BUT I WOULD MAKE

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.402
NOTE THAT THAT ASSUMPTION MEANS

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:19.606
THAT WE OF INCREASE THE RATES.

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:20.741
THAT WOULD NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.242
DONE YET SO I'VE- WHAT YOU SAY

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:24.912
BUT YEAH. STE CERTAINLY MISTER

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:26.814
CHAIR BACK THE I MEAN THE WHOLE

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.848
PREMISE IF THE RATES WERE

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.650
IMPLEMENTED AND- RIGHT BEN BEN

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:31.485
AS A PERCENTAGE OF THAT LARGER

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:32.719
BASE THEN YOU'D GET BUT IN THE

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:33.554
ABSENCE OF HIS MERE MINUTES I

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.055
WAS OF THE 12% AS A CAP ON WHAT

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:35.923
PROVIDERS CAN DELIVER THEY

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:36.824
DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:38.225
OPERATE AT THE 70% THROUGHOUT

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:39.760
TODAY IF THE RATES. REMAIN

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:41.762
UNCHANGED. WHICH AS MR HOUSE

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:42.863
REPORT ABOUT THE NOT ON CHANGE

01:41:42.930 --> 01:41:43.864
RIGHT THERE'S BEEN A FOR THE

01:41:43.931 --> 01:41:46.700
MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE- LIVE

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:47.801
WITH THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:49.970
MAKE THOUGH IS AS THE IF THE

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:50.838
RATE MODELS RECOMMENDED IN THE

01:41:50.904 --> 01:41:52.239
FUTURE YEAR AND THEY CONTINUE

01:41:52.306 --> 01:41:53.740
BE UPDATED AS WE WOULD SUGGEST

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.375
ACCOUNT FOR INCREASING RISE IN

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.777
THE COST THAT. 12% WILL

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:57.678
CONTINUE TO APPLY TO A LARGER

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:59.746
LARGER BEARS AND GENERATE MORE

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:00.948
ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS OVER THE

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.249
LONG TERM SO I THINK THOSE ARE

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.384
THE TWO PRIMARY CRITICISMS THAT

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.886
I HEARD DURING THE EARLY

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:09.890
REMARKS. OKAY AND THEN I GUESS

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:12.493
THE TERM. OF WORK FOR SELF

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:13.694
HEARD NOW. THIS YEAR BUT- PRIOR

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:15.362
HERE. ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:17.064
THE LARGE RATES OF TURNOVER AND

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.466
SO FORTH. IS AT THEIR

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.201
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. NOT JUST IN

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.536
TERMS OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:24.071
WE'RE- THE RATE STUDY LOOKING

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:26.173
AT BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD AND

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.541
MEANS THAT. WE TALK ABOUT

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.076
QUALITY MEASURES AND SO FORTH I

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.544
MEAN IT'S A SERVER PROCESS

01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:32.279
MEASURED TO. AND I KNOW THE

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:33.647
THAT'S ALSO IN CHILD CARE AND

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.415
SOME OTHER FIELDS WHERE. THERE

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:37.551
WERE WE'VE MAKING SOME EFFORTS

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:38.952
TO MONITOR. THE RATE OF

01:42:39.019 --> 01:42:41.622
TURNOVER BECAUSE- YOUNG WHEN

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:43.223
YOU JUST A DISTRICT A PROVIDER

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:44.591
TURN OVER DEBTS. IN

01:42:44.658 --> 01:42:45.893
RELATIONSHIPS THEY'RE HAVING TO

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:47.661
BE RENEWED OR CHANGED AND SO

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.096
FORTH AND THERE'S- THERE'S A

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:51.665
COST TO THAT TO BOTH PHYSICALLY

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:53.901
AND ALSO- FOR THE QUALITY S

01:42:53.967 --> 01:42:57.271
WELL SO. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:59.039
THE DEPARTMENTS. LOOKING INTO

01:42:59.106 --> 01:43:01.108
MONITOR. OF THE THOSE ARE NOW

01:43:01.174 --> 01:43:02.576
ARE PAYMENTS ALLOW YOU KNOW

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:06.813
CAUSING HIGH RATES OF. NO TURN

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.347
OVER TO WAYS WE CAN REDUCE

01:43:07.414 --> 01:43:11.251
TURNOVER. YEAH THANK THE-

01:43:11.318 --> 01:43:12.252
HAVING THE GRANULAR DETAIL THIS

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:14.087
THAT TURNER IT AS STATE LAW IS

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:16.290
TO STATE IT'S NOT IT VISIBILITY

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:18.158
THAT WE HAVE HOWEVER YOU KNOW

01:43:18.225 --> 01:43:19.259
WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS WE FOR

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:20.827
THE CONCERNS FROM THE-

01:43:20.894 --> 01:43:22.596
COMMUNITY BOTH THE- PROVIDERS

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:23.997
AND FAMILIES SO WE ARE

01:43:24.064 --> 01:43:24.998
EXPLORING THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.833
MECHANISMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.403
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DO-

01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:30.871
REVEALING ASSESSMENTS ARE WORKS

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:31.772
POINT WHAT THOSE OPTIONS ARE

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:32.873
WHERE THERE'S A NATIONAL CORE

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.375
INDICATORS ARE WAYS TO BE ABLE

01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:36.443
TO TAKE A LOOK AT STAFF

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:37.945
STABILITY AND- AND WHILE WE

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.313
HAVEN'T- ESTABLISHED A

01:43:39.379 --> 01:43:41.982
MECHANISM- AS OF NOW WE ARE

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:42.683
AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.217
EXPLORING HOW WE CAN. GET IT

01:43:44.284 --> 01:43:46.286
JUST ON VISIBILITY INTO INTO IT

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:48.088
OTHER THAN JUST ANECDOTAL

01:43:48.155 --> 01:43:50.057
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:50.657
BY THAT TIME THEY'LL BE THAT

01:43:50.724 --> 01:43:51.725
MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOME

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:53.427
MECHANISM TO BE DEVELOPED THAT

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.195
IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:56.730
KNOW MYRA QUALITY AND SERVICE

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:58.231
AND SO FORTH AND IF YOU DO

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:00.400
EVENTUALLY GO TO VALUE BASED-

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:02.970
PROCESS OF. THAT NO QUALITY

01:44:03.036 --> 01:44:04.271
DATA COLLECTION THINK CERTAINLY

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:07.975
ONE OF THE ITEMS TO LOOK AT IS-

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.910
PERFORCE TURNOVER RATE AND- IT

01:44:09.977 --> 01:44:11.678
IS SAID THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:14.748
COST TO TURNOVERS SO AND SO

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:15.949
WILL THEIR DATA COSTS SHOULD

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:18.885
THEN BE REINVESTED TO WORK FOR

01:44:18.952 --> 01:44:19.820
STABILITY INSTEAD OF SPENDING

01:44:19.886 --> 01:44:24.791
IT ON CONSTANTLY. BOWL AND THE

01:44:24.858 --> 01:44:27.594
IN IN PLANTS TO NEED TO GET IN

01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:28.729
TOUCH ANOTHER PROVIDER WHAT

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:29.563
THEIR SAID IS BECAUSE THAT

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.865
PERSON'S CHANGED EIGHT YEN ELF

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:33.734
THE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WITH-

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.968
SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN PUT

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:41.775
INTO PLACE. TO MONITOR THAT.

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.076
AND GET THAT KIND OF. IT

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.212
ADDITION TO MY BECAUSE WE AS A

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:47.247
ARE FACING SIMILAR CHALLENGES

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:48.582
THAT OTHER SYSTEMS ARE ARE

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:50.450
FACING AS FAR AS WORKFORCE SO

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.152
WE YOU KNOW NATIONALLY IT IS IT

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:55.288
A CONCERN AS TO YOU KNOW- IN IT

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:58.025
THE AVAILABILITY OF WORK FORCE

01:44:58.091 --> 01:45:00.494
SO WE ALSO ARE WANTING TO

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.395
WITHIN THAT DEVELOPMENT SERVICE

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.362
THAT'S WORSE IN THE WORK THAT

01:45:02.429 --> 01:45:03.330
WE'RE DOING IT AND THEN YOU

01:45:03.397 --> 01:45:04.998
KNOW LOOKING AT OUR- OTHER

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.267
STATE PARTNERS- IN IN OTHER

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:08.935
STATES AS TO HOW TO ADDRESS

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:10.037
SERVICE DELIVERY AND

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.938
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THAT

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:14.641
ARE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- WITHIN

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.909
OUR EXISTING MODELS BUT ARE

REFORM. TWO IMPORTANT THINGS

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:15.815
THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE DONE BY

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:16.750
THE SUBCOMMITTEE OR WORKING

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:19.352
WITH THE STATE. IS TO. MAKE

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:21.721

01:49:21.788 --> 01:49:22.856

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:38.939
DEALS WITH THE- INDEPENDENT

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:39.706
LIVING THE STATE HAS DONE

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.441

MEDI CAL IN OTHER WAYS AND SO.

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:44.678
I THINK THE STATE. SHOULD

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:46.613
CONSIDER THAT THE OTHER. IS

SHOULD THE MEETING SHOULD BE

01:49:55.288 --> 01:49:57.857
POSTED PUBLICLY. I THINK THAT

01:49:57.924 --> 01:49:58.458

01:49:58.525 --> 01:49:59.392

WAY TO DO THAT AND LASTLY- WE

01:50:24.884 --> 01:50:25.552
