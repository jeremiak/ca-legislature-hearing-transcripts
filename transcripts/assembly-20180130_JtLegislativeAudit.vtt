CALIFORNIA'S WE STREAM.

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:09.013 region:rollup2
THIS POLICY APPROACH IS

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.881 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.849 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE FOR PRODUCTS THAT HAVE

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:12.917 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AND OF LIFE IMPACTS

00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
SUCH AS MATTRESSES.

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:15.486 region:rollup2
CPSU SUPPORTS I REQUEST TO

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:16.788 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE MATTRESS

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.956 region:rollup2
RECYCLING COUNCIL IS FULFILLING

00:39:16.788 --> 00:39:20.158 region:rollup2
THE GOALS OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:21.526 region:rollup2
MATCHES RECYCLING LA.

00:39:20.158 --> 00:39:23.061 region:rollup2
THIS IS A TARGETED AUDIT THAT

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:24.062 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES SOME KEY ISSUES TO

00:39:23.061 --> 00:39:25.396 region:rollup2
ASSESS THE SUCCESSES AND

00:39:24.062 --> 00:39:27.131 region:rollup2
FAILURES OF THE EMBASSIES

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:28.266 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THUS FAR.

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.334 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO WORKING WITH MRC

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:30.568 region:rollup2
ENCOUNTER CYCLE TO ADDRESS

00:39:29.334 --> 00:39:32.437 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT DON'T FALL WITHIN

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:33.338 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THIS AUDIT REQUEST.

00:39:32.437 --> 00:39:34.772 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROGRAM IS OFF TO A

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:35.940 region:rollup2
FAIRLY GOOD START AND WE HAVE

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:37.342 region:rollup2
SEEN SOME POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.209 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO SEEN INDICATIONS OF A

00:39:37.342 --> 00:39:39.711 region:rollup2
NEED TO ASSESS THEM MARCY'S

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:40.511 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.080 region:rollup2
A KEY REASON THAT THIS PROGRAM

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:44.082 region:rollup2
WAS ESTABLISHED WAS TO REDUCE

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.682 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL DUMPING OF MATTRESSES

00:39:44.082 --> 00:39:46.251 region:rollup2
AND ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:47.385 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE.

00:39:46.251 --> 00:39:48.353 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL DUMPING IS STILL A

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.721 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN

00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:51.956 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:53.258 region:rollup2
ARE BURDENED WITH RELATED COSTS.

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:54.525 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS THAT THE MRC COULD BE

00:39:53.258 --> 00:39:56.427 region:rollup2
DOING MORE TO FULLY REALIZE THE

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:58.263 region:rollup2
GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:39:56.427 --> 00:40:00.265 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GEORGIA PROGRAMS ARE

00:39:58.263 --> 00:40:01.466 region:rollup2
NIGHT APR EPR PRODUCER PAY MODEL

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:02.934 region:rollup2
NOR A GOVERNMENT COMMAND AND

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:03.968 region:rollup2
CONTROL APPROACH WE'VE SEEN SOME

00:40:02.934 --> 00:40:05.470 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE'S PROGRAMS FACE

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.671 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.572 region:rollup2
THIS AUDIT WILL HAVE IT'S GET

00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:09.240 region:rollup2
AHEAD OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:10.241 region:rollup2
THE MATCHES PROGRAM TO ADDRESS

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:13.945 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT AND NOT WAY AS WE DID

00:40:12.043 --> 00:40:14.379 region:rollup2
ON CARPET FOR EXAMPLE.

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:15.914 region:rollup2
WE NO THE INCREASING

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:17.015 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:18.516 region:rollup2
IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE

00:40:17.015 --> 00:40:19.284 region:rollup2
MATTRESS RECYCLING PROGRAM WILL

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:21.185 region:rollup2
HOPE IS COLLECTIVELY MAKE

00:40:19.284 --> 00:40:22.887 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY. TO

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:24.022 region:rollup2
AVOID FAILURE DOWN THE LINE.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.356 region:rollup2
AS CALIFORNIA'S GOING BACKWARDS

00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:26.925 region:rollup2
ON A RECYCLING RATE WHILE TRYING

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:28.559 region:rollup2
TO REACH THE STATE SEVENTY FIVE

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:29.294 region:rollup2
PERCENT WASTE RECYCLING GOAL WE

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.561 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE A REVIEW OF THIS

00:40:29.294 --> 00:40:32.297 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO WE CAN ENSURETHAT

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:34.032 region:rollup2

OF THE PROGRAM RIPPING MATT

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.790 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:00.091 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND WE WOULD BASICALLY

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.259 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:02.794 region:rollup2
IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING THE

00:41:01.259 --> 00:41:05.029 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:05.930 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM THIS POLICY USES A

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:07.865 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODEL WHERE THE

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:10.234 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:11.569 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN THE INDUSTRY IS

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:12.070 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THE FUNDS FROM

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:14.872 region:rollup2

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:16.574 region:rollup2
MATTRESS.

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:18.843 region:rollup2
THE BILL BILL TELL YOU THAT THE

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:19.811 region:rollup2
STATE MAKES US CHARGE THIS TEN

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:22.213 region:rollup2
FIFTY OR THIS.

00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:22.780 region:rollup2
ON THE MATTRESS BUT IN FACT

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:25.049 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO THE MATTRESS

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.851 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:28.553 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT IN THIS LEGISLATION

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.121 region:rollup2
WE FOUGHT WE HAD BUILT OVERSIGHT

00:41:28.553 --> 00:41:32.256 region:rollup2
INTO THIS PROGRAM OVERSIGHT BY

00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:33.524 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLE. AND OVERSIGHT BY AN

COUNCIL

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:38.463 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE EVIDENCE OVER THE

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:41.032 region:rollup2
LAST SIX MONTHS IS THAT THOSE

00:41:38.463 --> 00:41:43.668 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS ARE WORKING.

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:45.503 region:rollup2
ARE THE MATTRESS INDUSTRY WE'RE

00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:46.637 region:rollup2
NOT SATISFIED WITH TWENTY FIVE

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:48.406 region:rollup2
PERCENT RECOVERY RATE WHEN

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:49.407 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE AND A

00:41:48.406 --> 00:41:51.876 region:rollup2
HALF MILLION MATTRESSES BEING

00:41:49.407 --> 00:41:53.978 region:rollup2
GENERATED POTENTIALLY DISCARDED.

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:56.080 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT PRIVATE SECTOR AND

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:58.149 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SECTOR UP OPERATORS LIKE

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.550 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE

00:41:58.149 --> 00:42:01.586 region:rollup2
COLLECTING USED MATTRESSES AND

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.653 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T GET THOSE MATTRESSES

00:42:01.586 --> 00:42:04.122 region:rollup2
INTO THE RECYCLING STREAM

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:05.790 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE

00:42:04.122 --> 00:42:06.657 region:rollup2
NOT BEING PAID ENOUGH.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.226 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:09.761 region:rollup2
SURPLUS THAT IS GOING TO

00:42:08.226 --> 00:42:12.363 region:rollup2
APPROACH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:09.761 --> 00:42:14.298 region:rollup2
FOR A PROGRAM. THAT IS HAS OF A

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:16.067 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL.

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:18.503 region:rollup2
INCOME REVENUE STREAM THAT SEEMS

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:20.505 region:rollup2
LIKE AN AWFULLY LARGE BUDGET

00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:21.572 region:rollup2
SURPLUS TO HAVE WHEN YOU'RE NOT

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:23.408 region:rollup2

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:26.144 region:rollup2
YOUR PROGRAM OBJECTIVES.

00:42:23.408 --> 00:42:28.813 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THAT THIS OVERSIGHT

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:30.415 region:rollup2
BY BY THE. J. LACK MAY BE THE

00:42:28.813 --> 00:42:31.949 region:rollup2
ONLY GAME IN TOWN IN TERMS OF

PROVIDING OVERSIGHT THAT WE MAY

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:35.319 region:rollup2
HAVE TO. THE LEGISLATURE MAY

00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:37.088 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RE EXAMINE WHETHER OR

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:38.589 region:rollup2
NOT THIS KIND OF POLICY EVEN

00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:40.358 region:rollup2

BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE

00:42:44.462 --> 00:42:46.798 region:rollup2
ONLY MECHANISM WE HAVE TO KIND

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:48.232 region:rollup2
OF TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING

00:42:46.798 --> 00:42:49.867 region:rollup2

ANY RECYCLING FACILITIES BECAUSE

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:58.322 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT CONTINUES TO BE A

00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:59.756 region:rollup2
HUGE ISSUE.

00:55:58.322 --> 00:56:00.691 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL DUMPING IS ONE OF THE

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:02.659 region:rollup2
THE MAIN.

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:03.927 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF THE PROGRAM IS TO

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:05.095 region:rollup2

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:13.403 region:rollup2
AS A A A PRIORITY AS WELL.

00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:14.938 region:rollup2
THE THE NATURE OF.

THIS PROGRAM WHICH FOLLOWS SOME

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:18.542 region:rollup2
EXTENDED PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:20.043 region:rollup2

00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:22.012 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:22.412 region:rollup2

00:56:22.012 --> 00:56:24.314 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:26.550 region:rollup2
STORAGE ORGANIZATION HAS SOME

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:28.552 region:rollup2

ITS.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.458 region:rollup2
APPROVAL OF THE FIRST DOWN

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:36.093 region:rollup2
REPORT HIGHLIGHTED SOME AREAS

00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.828 region:rollup2
WHERE WE THOUGHT THAT. UP SOME

00:56:36.093 --> 00:56:39.897 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL UP WORK NEEDS TO BE

00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:41.632 region:rollup2
DONE AND I THINK THAT MRC

00:56:39.897 --> 00:56:42.666 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZES THAT IT AS WELL.

00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:44.468 region:rollup2

00:56:44.468 --> 00:56:49.172 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING TO OBTAIN TO TRY AND

TRIED TO DO DURING THE FIRST

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.815 region:rollup2

THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE TO

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:02.252 region:rollup2
TRY AND IDENTIFY.

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.854 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DATA SO THAT

OUR MOST RECENT AUDIT HAS SHOWN

01:26:30.318 --> 01:26:34.156 region:rollup2

EXCUSE ME.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:51.339 region:rollup2
SO.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:54.076 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT LEAD UP TO THIS

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:55.944 region:rollup2
AUDIT REQUEST HEAD.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:57.713 region:rollup2
HAS THERE BEEN ANY EVIDENCE OR

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:59.181 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU UNCOVERED ANY EVIDENCE

01:26:57.713 --> 01:27:01.016 region:rollup2
OR IS ANYONE PRESENTED YOU WITH

01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:02.517 region:rollup2
ANY EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:04.419 region:rollup2
THIS MISS CLASSIFICATION WAS THE

01:27:02.517 --> 01:27:06.288 region:rollup2
RESULT.

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:06.822 region:rollup2
OF INTENTIONAL CONDUCT OR

01:27:06.288 --> 01:27:09.191 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:10.258 region:rollup2
ANYONE.

01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:12.727 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE.

01:27:10.258 --> 01:27:13.929 region:rollup2
LAPD ORGANIZATION.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.330 region:rollup2
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:16.865 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION THAT I'M TRYING TO TO

01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:18.967 region:rollup2
PRESENT FORWARD IS THAT THERE'S

01:27:16.865 --> 01:27:21.103 region:rollup2
ANY INTENTIONAL. MISCONDUCT OR

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:22.337 region:rollup2
MANIPULATION HOWEVER I THINK WE

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:23.572 region:rollup2
LIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:24.706 region:rollup2
WITH THE PUBLIC TRUST WITH LAW

01:27:23.572 --> 01:27:26.508 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT HAS ERODED

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:28.810 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY. AND I WOULD LIKE

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:31.146 region:rollup2
TO BUILD THAT BACK IF THERE ARE.

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:32.881 region:rollup2
A SUSTAINABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:27:31.146 --> 01:27:34.449 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN ERROR RATE THAT CAN

01:27:32.881 --> 01:27:35.784 region:rollup2
BE EXPLAINED THAT IT SHOULD BE

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:37.119 region:rollup2
DONE SO THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT

01:27:35.784 --> 01:27:38.453 region:rollup2
AUDITOR.

01:27:37.119 --> 01:27:40.088 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY GOAL

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:41.957 region:rollup2
IS TO TRY TO BUILD PUBLIC TRUST

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:44.092 region:rollup2
BACK IT'S NOT TO LA.

01:27:41.957 --> 01:27:44.960 region:rollup2
TWO ALLEGED THERE'S MISTRUST.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:46.261 region:rollup2
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.896 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT MEAN THIS IS A AN

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.030 region:rollup2
ERROR RATE IT'S.

01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:50.565 region:rollup2
BARELY BEEN ESTABLISHED ON

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:52.501 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS BY

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:55.570 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DIFFERENT METHODS NOT.

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:56.338 region:rollup2
YET BY THE STATE AUDITOR.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:58.573 region:rollup2
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:59.441 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES IT AND IT

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:01.409 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE THE FEDERAL BUREAU

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:03.044 region:rollup2
OF INVESTIGATION IS DEVELOPING A

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:04.412 region:rollup2
NEW SYSTEM THAT LAPD WILL

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:05.881 region:rollup2
UTILIZE WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:08.216 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEM NUMBER OF MISS

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:09.651 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATIONS.

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:10.719 region:rollup2
AND IF IN FACT THAT'S THE CASE

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.553 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:13.522 region:rollup2
CASE BUT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:15.023 region:rollup2
PRESENTED.

01:28:13.522 --> 01:28:15.824 region:rollup2
THEN I'M CONCERNED OF FOR GOING

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:17.459 region:rollup2
TO SPEND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:19.161 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO HAVE

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:20.862 region:rollup2
OUR STATE OUGHT TO GO AND VERIFY

01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.898 region:rollup2
THAT THE OTHER RATE IN FACT IS

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:25.066 region:rollup2
NINE OR TEN PERCENT.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:26.368 region:rollup2
FOR MISS CLASSIFICATIONS.

01:28:25.066 --> 01:28:28.603 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT THE RESULT OF ANY

01:28:26.368 --> 01:28:30.138 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT OR OR

01:28:28.603 --> 01:28:32.541 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL ACT ON THE PART OF

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:34.743 region:rollup2
LAPD OR THE MAYOR ANYBODY ELSE

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:36.978 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO.

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:38.246 region:rollup2
TO ARTIFICIALLY LOWER.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:40.048 region:rollup2
IT COULD A CRIME RATE IN THE

01:28:38.246 --> 01:28:41.550 region:rollup2
CITY THEN I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:43.819 region:rollup2
ARE AT THE END OF THE AUDIT ARE

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.419 region:rollup2
WE WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH IS

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.587 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THERE'S A NINE OR TEN

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:47.522 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:49.491 region:rollup2
MISS CLASSIFICATION RATE AND

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:50.859 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND FBI FIGURED OUT

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.627 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET LOWER BUT THAT

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:53.962 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.162 region:rollup2
ASSUMES A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS

01:28:53.962 --> 01:28:56.698 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:58.200 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE FACTUAL AND THAT'S

01:28:56.698 --> 01:28:59.868 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE LIKE THE OUTSIDE

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.169 region:rollup2
AUDITOR TO COME INTO VERIFY.

01:28:59.868 --> 01:29:02.838 region:rollup2
THEIR THERE VERY WELL MAY BE

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:04.940 region:rollup2
SUBMITS AND SOME ACTUAL

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:06.875 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL AND MANIPULATION OF

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:08.410 region:rollup2
NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:09.444 region:rollup2
SUSPICION OF MANY IN THE PUBLIC.

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:10.812 region:rollup2
AND THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:12.480 region:rollup2
CRAFT.

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:14.916 region:rollup2
FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:16.518 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND AS LEGISLATURE

01:29:14.916 --> 01:29:18.553 region:rollup2
CULTURALLY STATISTICS AND SO THE

01:29:16.518 --> 01:29:20.322 region:rollup2
STATISTICS ARE VERY VERY

01:29:18.553 --> 01:29:22.257 region:rollup2
IMPACTFUL ON THIS ENTIRE STATE.

01:29:20.322 --> 01:29:24.960 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE MISREPRESENTATION OF

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:25.460 region:rollup2
FACTS TO THE DEGREE I MEAN THEY

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:27.762 region:rollup2
INDICATE A THREE HUNDRED

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.031 region:rollup2
THOUSAND. THAT'S A LOT LOT OF

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:32.434 region:rollup2
SALADA CRIMES AND WHEN WE HAVE

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:34.803 region:rollup2
EVEN AT A TEMPER SENT RATE. OF

01:29:32.434 --> 01:29:37.239 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT COULD BE A CRAFTED

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:39.307 region:rollup2
DOWN TO FIVE OR FOUR PERCENT.

01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:40.342 region:rollup2
THEN WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:41.977 region:rollup2
VERY THING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:43.578 region:rollup2
WE'RE MAKING HONEST DECISIONS

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:44.880 region:rollup2
BASED ON HONEST INFORMATION WE

01:29:43.578 --> 01:29:47.315 region:rollup2
DON'T GO TO MY QUESTIONS IS

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:49.618 region:rollup2
BEING CRITICAL I MEAN I I THINK.

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:51.419 region:rollup2
SORT OF A.

01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:52.988 region:rollup2
OF A BIPARTISAN QUESTIONER WHEN

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:53.922 region:rollup2
IT COMES TO BEING IN HERE

01:29:52.988 --> 01:29:55.457 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S AN AUDIT COMING

01:29:53.922 --> 01:29:56.958 region:rollup2
FROM THE LEFT OR NOT COMING FROM

01:29:55.457 --> 01:29:58.793 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT AYE I TEND TO BE

01:29:56.958 --> 01:30:00.262 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.862 region:rollup2
AND I USE THE TERM FISHING

01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:02.764 region:rollup2
EXPEDITION AND THAT SHOULDN'T

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:04.633 region:rollup2
BE.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:06.568 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TO BE A CRITICISM IT'S

01:30:04.633 --> 01:30:08.203 region:rollup2
NOT BUT I TEND TO BE A LITTLE

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.804 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WHEN WE SEND OUR STATE

01:30:08.203 --> 01:30:11.706 region:rollup2
AUDITOR OUT ON A.

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:13.775 region:rollup2
ON A MISSION WHERE THERE IS NO

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:15.477 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE TO INDICATE.

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:16.578 region:rollup2
A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE FOR

01:30:15.477 --> 01:30:17.078 region:rollup2
THOSE YOU IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.247 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.615 region:rollup2
OCCURRED.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:22.217 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:23.184 region:rollup2
QUESTIONING BUT I WON'T BELABOR

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:24.886 region:rollup2

AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL RUN INTO

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:35.897 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE. THE REQUEST

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:37.999 region:rollup2
FOR AN AUDIT IS PERCEIVED AS

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:39.868 region:rollup2
ADVERSARIAL. AND A DOESN'T SEEM

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.635 region:rollup2
TO ME THAT IN THIS CASE IT IS I

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:41.903 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE'RE ALL THE SAME

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:43.071 region:rollup2
TEAM HERE WERE TRY TO REDUCE THE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:44.606 region:rollup2
ERROR RATES OF THE

01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:46.341 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION OF THESE CRIMES.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.809 region:rollup2
ARE BUT IN READING THE

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:49.377 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE IT SEEMS

01:30:47.809 --> 01:30:50.545 region:rollup2
LIKE THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT

01:30:49.377 --> 01:30:51.947 region:rollup2
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:53.748 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT'S BEING CALLED INTO

01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:55.383 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I CERTAINLY DON'T.

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:57.686 region:rollup2
DON'T ENTER PREDICT THAT WAY.

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:59.254 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION IS THIS IF.

01:30:57.686 --> 01:31:00.822 region:rollup2
THE

01:30:59.254 --> 01:31:03.425 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE OF THE STATE AUDITOR

01:31:00.822 --> 01:31:04.693 region:rollup2
WOULD PA WOULD BE HELPFUL IN

01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:06.127 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHING PROCEDURES THAT

01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:07.929 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE AIR RAID I THINK THAT

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:10.365 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WOULD BENEFIT.

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:11.967 region:rollup2
ANSWER MY QUESTION USE IS WOULD.

01:31:10.365 --> 01:31:13.468 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR BE OF ASSISTANCE IN

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.970 region:rollup2
THAT RESPECT AND IF NOT THEN WHY

NOT.

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:18.173 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR POSITION THAT THE ART

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:19.474 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE OF LITTLE OR NO

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:21.042 region:rollup2
VALUE TO US IN THE REASON FOR

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.177 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.578 region:rollup2
EXTERNAL AUDITS THAT ARE

TIMES.

WE HAVE ASKED THE FBI UP FOR

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:47.302 region:rollup2
MORE GUIDANCE ON WHAT IS AN

01:31:48.603 --> 01:31:52.073 region:rollup2
FULLY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH

01:31:50.472 --> 01:31:53.575 region:rollup2
OUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES.

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:55.377 region:rollup2
I'M I THINK OF WHAT WAS

01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:57.379 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER UP BY THE VICE

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:58.313 region:rollup2
CHAIR IS TRUE WE EXPECT THAT

01:31:57.379 --> 01:31:59.514 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE FOUND AN

01:31:58.313 --> 01:32:01.783 region:rollup2
ERROR RATE. TO THE EXTENT

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:03.718 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANY AN ALLEGATION OF ANY

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:05.487 region:rollup2
INTENTIONAL MANIPULATION WHICH

01:32:03.718 --> 01:32:06.554 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY BUT WHEN

01:32:05.487 --> 01:32:07.889 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

01:32:06.554 --> 01:32:09.624 region:rollup2
UP IN THE PAST THE DEPARTMENT

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:11.259 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED A VERY THOROUGH.

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:12.594 region:rollup2
INTERNAL INVESTIGATION MARIE HAD

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:13.928 region:rollup2
THE A POWER AND ABILITY TO

01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:15.063 region:rollup2
COMPEL.

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:17.365 region:rollup2
OFFICERS TO SPEAK AND

01:32:15.063 --> 01:32:18.466 region:rollup2
DETECTIVES AND THERE WAS NOTHING

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.868 region:rollup2
FAILED TO SHOW INTENTIONAL

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:22.237 region:rollup2
MANIPULATION OR THE ANY

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:22.871 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR ALLEGATIONS TO THAT

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:23.538 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PENDING THAT I'M AWARE

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:26.408 region:rollup2
OF.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:28.143 region:rollup2
SO SOMEBODY COMING IN AND AND IF

01:32:26.408 --> 01:32:29.477 region:rollup2
EXPENDING THAT THOSE RESOURCES

01:32:28.143 --> 01:32:31.613 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE MIGHT BE

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:33.214 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BUT. GIVEN OUR

01:32:31.613 --> 01:32:34.616 region:rollup2
OPENNESS OR TRANSPARENCY THE

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:36.551 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT WE

01:32:34.616 --> 01:32:38.052 region:rollup2
SPEND CURRENTLY I I WOULD NOT

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:40.488 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO FIND ANYTHING THAT

01:32:38.052 --> 01:32:41.923 region:rollup2
WOULD CERTAINLY BE. LIKELY TO

01:32:40.488 --> 01:32:44.025 region:rollup2
REDUCE OUR RATE FROM.

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:45.894 region:rollup2
SIX PERCENT TO TWO OF WE'RE

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:46.628 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY DRIVING TO DO THAT

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.328 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING IS VERY

01:32:46.628 --> 01:32:48.997 region:rollup2
PORTANT.

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:50.632 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY

01:32:48.997 --> 01:32:52.333 region:rollup2
MISREPRESENTATIONS OF OUR CRIME

01:32:50.632 --> 01:32:53.668 region:rollup2
STATISTICS

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.502 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ALWAYS INDICATED THAT

01:32:53.668 --> 01:32:56.104 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ERROR

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:57.639 region:rollup2
RATE AND WHAT WE'RE REPRESENT

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:59.374 region:rollup2
WHICH IS. FAIRLY KNOWN

01:32:57.639 --> 01:33:00.842 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY I THINK

01:32:59.374 --> 01:33:03.111 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WOULD WOULD BE MORE THAN

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:04.913 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO DO IS IF THERE IS AN

01:33:03.111 --> 01:33:06.848 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN LOOKING AT OUR. UP

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:09.217 region:rollup2
PROCESSES ARE PROCEDURES ALL OF

01:33:06.848 --> 01:33:10.852 region:rollup2
OUR INTERNAL THE EXTERNAL AUDITS

01:33:09.217 --> 01:33:12.320 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTANDING OF OF THAT.

01:33:10.852 --> 01:33:14.155 region:rollup2
WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.757 region:rollup2
AS WE DO IT FREQUENTLY WE WERE

01:33:14.155 --> 01:33:17.892 region:rollup2
ONLY TOLD OF THIS INTEREST IN

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:19.294 region:rollup2
DOING AN AUDIT LAST WEEK.

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:20.995 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'VE BEEN SORT OF IN A

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:22.964 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE WE'RE NOW.

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:24.466 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SHOW THE MANY MANY

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:26.668 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING

01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:28.069 region:rollup2
SINCE THE ORIGINAL REPORT. WAS

01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:29.637 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:31.039 region:rollup2
WELL JUST TO BE CLEAR EYED

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:34.843 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN REQUEST I READ

01:33:31.039 --> 01:33:36.911 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT ANY OF THE. ERRORS

01:33:34.843 --> 01:33:38.746 region:rollup2
IN REPORTING ARE INTENTIONAL.

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:39.714 region:rollup2
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT. WE AT

01:33:38.746 --> 01:33:41.449 region:rollup2

OUT PATHWAYS FOR REDUCING THE

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.320 region:rollup2
ERROR RATE I'M I'M I THINK WE'RE

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:46.855 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALL MOTIVATED GIVE YOU

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.022 region:rollup2

SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.357 region:rollup2
ANSWERING THE QUESTION THANK

MR OF THE NINETIES COMMENT JUST

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:58.833 region:rollup2
CORRECT FOR SURE THAT THIS

01:33:57.866 --> 01:34:01.035 region:rollup2
DOESN'T APPEAR TO ME TO BE AN

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:01.870 region:rollup2
ADVERSARIAL WINE OR WHINE WHERE.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:03.638 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR IS.

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:05.206 region:rollup2
JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:06.808 region:rollup2
AUDIT I THINK

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:08.109 region:rollup2
I WENT WHEN I LEARNED OF THIS

01:34:06.808 --> 01:34:09.177 region:rollup2
AUDIT REQUEST AND SAW SOME OF

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.078 region:rollup2
THE BACK WHEN I THOUGHT AS A

01:34:09.177 --> 01:34:11.880 region:rollup2
STATE LEGISLATOR I WOULD REALLY

01:34:10.078 --> 01:34:14.449 region:rollup2
LIKE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION%

01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:16.451 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. LA IS THIS LARGEST CITY

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:18.119 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA AND WEIGHS IN ON

01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:19.854 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE VOTING

01:34:18.119 --> 01:34:21.489 region:rollup2
ON LAST SESSION THE SESSION AND

01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:24.759 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:26.828 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO ASK OUR AUDITOR.

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:28.730 region:rollup2
THINK TWO QUESTIONS.

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:30.899 region:rollup2
IF IF THE THE SCOPE OF THE

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:33.234 region:rollup2
AUDITED AS AS YOU UNDERSTAND IT

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:35.303 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW YOU TO FIND OUT.

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:36.971 region:rollup2
INCLUDE BY LOOKING EVER TENURE

01:34:35.303 --> 01:34:37.539 region:rollup2
PERIOD WHAT OF THE ITEMS THAT

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.806 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN CHANGED HAVE BEEN

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:40.175 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:41.242 region:rollup2
I LIKE A CAUSAL LINK BECAUSE

01:34:40.175 --> 01:34:42.110 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:43.511 region:rollup2
WHEN I'M READING IN THE

01:34:42.110 --> 01:34:44.679 region:rollup2
RESPONSES AND OTHERWISE IF

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.981 region:rollup2
CHANGING THINGS AND OUR ERROR

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:48.283 region:rollup2
RATE IS BETTER. WE HEAR A LOT IS

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:50.251 region:rollup2
OF LEGISLATORS THAT THERE'S

01:34:48.283 --> 01:34:53.087 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUT THERE AND THERE FOR

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:54.556 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE ENTITY HAS IMPROVED

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:55.823 region:rollup2
SOME RATE OF.

01:34:54.556 --> 01:34:57.058 region:rollup2
RETURN OR SOME RATE OF

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.459 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS BUT THEY CAN'T

01:34:57.058 --> 01:34:59.794 region:rollup2
DRAW A LINE BETWEEN HERE'S WHAT

01:34:58.459 --> 01:35:01.696 region:rollup2
WE DID HERE AND THIS IS WHY IT

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:03.131 region:rollup2
WAS EFFECTIVE. I WOULD LIKE TO

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:03.698 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT DOES THIS AUDIT GIVE

01:35:03.131 --> 01:35:04.832 region:rollup2
YOU THE CAPABILITY OF DOING

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.634 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:07.402 region:rollup2
YES IT DOES THERE ARE SPECIFIC

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:09.170 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES THAT.

01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:10.939 region:rollup2
MISTER LACKEY HAS ASKED US TO

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:13.341 region:rollup2
LOOK AT STEPS THAT LAPD HAS

01:35:10.939 --> 01:35:15.109 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE AND

01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:16.211 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED IN LOOKING AT

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:19.247 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:21.716 region:rollup2
OVER THE WEEKEND THEY. THE LAPD

01:35:19.247 --> 01:35:22.817 region:rollup2
SHERIFF I MEAN I'M.

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:24.852 region:rollup2
CHECK CHIEF BACK I APOLOGIZE

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:26.254 region:rollup2
CHIEF BACK ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.722 region:rollup2
A DATA INTEGRITY UNIT I THINK

01:35:26.254 --> 01:35:29.157 region:rollup2
IT'S REFERRED TO SO WE WOULD

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:31.559 region:rollup2
WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AS PERHAPS.

01:35:29.157 --> 01:35:33.561 region:rollup2
A BEST PRACTICE THAT LAPD IS

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:35.597 region:rollup2
USING WHEN DID THAT UNIT ONE WAS

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:37.165 region:rollup2
AT UNICREDIT AND WHAT'S THE DISK

01:35:35.597 --> 01:35:39.167 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW MUCH WAS

01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:41.402 region:rollup2
MIS REPORTED ARE UNDER REPORTED

01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:43.071 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO. AND NOW SUBSEQUENT AS

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:44.806 region:rollup2
AS A GENTLEMAN INDICATED THERE

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:47.075 region:rollup2
ARE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

01:35:44.806 --> 01:35:49.010 region:rollup2
WORKING ON REVIEWING REPORTS TO

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:50.478 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THEY'RE. APPROPRIATELY

01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:52.313 region:rollup2
CLASSIFIED AND ENTERED INTO THE

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:54.082 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO I THINK. IF THEY'RE

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:55.583 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHEN SOME OF THOSE

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:57.185 region:rollup2
MEASURES WERE TAKEN WE CAN LOOK

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:58.820 region:rollup2
AT THE BEFORE AND AFTER AND I

01:35:57.185 --> 01:35:59.787 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S WHY MISTER LACKEY.

01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.190 region:rollup2
ASKED US TO LOOK AT A TEN YEAR

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:04.192 region:rollup2
WINDOW I THINK THAT'S GOOD

01:36:02.190 --> 01:36:05.927 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT THAT TO ME.

01:36:04.192 --> 01:36:08.296 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE GET AT THE END OF THE

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:11.065 region:rollup2
LINE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE EITHER

01:36:08.296 --> 01:36:11.566 region:rollup2
KOZOL. AYE CONNECTION OR SO THAT

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.234 region:rollup2
WE CAN BE MAKING BETTER

01:36:11.566 --> 01:36:14.736 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT WILL AFFECT THE

01:36:13.234 --> 01:36:16.271 region:rollup2
STATE BECAUSE AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:36:14.736 --> 01:36:17.372 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING FROM LOS ANGELES

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:18.940 region:rollup2
THE POLICIES THAT. ARE

01:36:17.372 --> 01:36:20.275 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED AT THE STATE LEVEL

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.609 region:rollup2
ARE FACT IN THE AREA AND OTHER

01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:25.346 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:27.515 region:rollup2
AND AND I ALSO WANT TO.

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:28.383 region:rollup2
ASK THE OTHER AUDITS THAT HAVE

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:29.884 region:rollup2
BEEN MENTIONED THE INSPECTOR

01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:31.552 region:rollup2
GENERAL OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:33.021 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF THOSE AS PART OF

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:34.822 region:rollup2
YOUR. WORK I THINK IN YOUR

01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:35.823 region:rollup2
OPENING TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED

01:36:34.822 --> 01:36:38.559 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THEM

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:40.495 region:rollup2
AND AND SO I'M.

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:42.764 region:rollup2
IT THAT BECOMES NOT DUPLICATIVE

01:36:40.495 --> 01:36:43.331 region:rollup2
BUT THAT CAN BE USEFUL TO YOU

01:36:42.764 --> 01:36:44.499 region:rollup2
AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:45.967 region:rollup2
ALREADY OUT THERE.

01:36:44.499 --> 01:36:47.335 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY AND IN PREPARATION

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:48.836 region:rollup2
FOR THE HEARING I ALWAYS I HAVE

01:36:47.335 --> 01:36:50.938 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE BACKGROUND BINDERS THAT

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.472 region:rollup2
STAFF PREPARE FOR ME SO I CAN BE

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.640 region:rollup2
OKAY A LITTLE BETTER UP TO

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:53.708 region:rollup2
SPEED.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.643 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS

01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:57.512 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT SO YES ABSOLUTELY WE

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:59.247 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK AT INSPECTOR GENERAL

01:36:57.512 --> 01:37:00.715 region:rollup2
REPORTS ANY INTERNAL AUDITS THAT

01:36:59.247 --> 01:37:01.883 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DONE AND UNDER OUR

AUDIT STANDARDS THAT MY OFFICE

ACCEPTED AUDITING STANDARDS WE

01:37:07.555 --> 01:37:10.625 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT OTHER

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:12.193 region:rollup2
WORK IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE SO

01:37:10.625 --> 01:37:13.528 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THAT

01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:15.163 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN RELY ON

01:37:13.528 --> 01:37:17.198 region:rollup2
IT AND NOT DUPLICATE WORK THAT'S

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:18.333 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN DONE. I WAS VERY

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:19.734 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN SEEING THE

01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:20.968 region:rollup2
INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT THAT

01:37:19.734 --> 01:37:22.537 region:rollup2
WAS DONE ON THE LA SHERIFF'S

01:37:20.968 --> 01:37:24.105 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HOW THEY WENT ABOUT

01:37:22.537 --> 01:37:25.740 region:rollup2
SELECTING THEIR SAMPLE WHAT THE

01:37:24.105 --> 01:37:27.041 region:rollup2
SIZE WAS WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS

01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:27.975 region:rollup2
THEY ASKED.

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.544 region:rollup2
BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AS

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:31.312 region:rollup2
FAR AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO

01:37:29.544 --> 01:37:32.447 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD WE WOULD START

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:33.981 region:rollup2
BY LOOKING AT WHAT'S ALREADY

01:37:32.447 --> 01:37:35.550 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE LEARN FROM THAT AND

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:37.251 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW THAT WILL AFFECT

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:38.453 region:rollup2
OUR APPROACH. IN CONDUCTING THIS

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:40.288 region:rollup2
AUDIT IF THE COMMITTEE DECIDES

01:37:38.453 --> 01:37:42.223 region:rollup2
TO PROVE IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR AYE

01:37:40.288 --> 01:37:43.257 region:rollup2
I DO YOU SEE AN END PRODUCT THAT

LAPD. I LOOK AT THIS AS

AGAIN NOT ADVERSARIAL I LOOK AT

01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:31.272 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:38:29.537 --> 01:38:31.839 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENT THE RESOURCES THAT

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:33.808 region:rollup2
THE LAPD IN INTERNAL AUDITS

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:34.976 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:38:33.808 --> 01:38:36.878 region:rollup2
I LOOK AT THIS AS AN

01:38:34.976 --> 01:38:38.646 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE TO BE

01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:39.981 region:rollup2
ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:42.116 region:rollup2
THEIR. YOU KNOW POLICIES AND

01:38:39.981 --> 01:38:42.884 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES BUT ALSO TO JUST YA

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:45.052 region:rollup2
CAN'T HAVE A BACKSTOP.

01:38:42.884 --> 01:38:46.254 region:rollup2
IT IT CERTAINLY A TIME GOING TO

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:47.188 region:rollup2
SPEND.

01:38:46.254 --> 01:38:49.390 region:rollup2
THE STATE RESOURCES HE SHOULD

01:38:47.188 --> 01:38:50.558 region:rollup2
HAVE A A THE POSITIVE OUTCOME IN

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:51.993 region:rollup2
TERMS OF. YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF

01:38:50.558 --> 01:38:53.561 region:rollup2
INFORMATION THAT WERE WERE

01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:55.463 region:rollup2
SEEKING AND ONE WHAT THE END

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:56.764 region:rollup2
GOAL AS. A BUT I LOOK AT THE

01:38:55.463 --> 01:38:58.566 region:rollup2
BACKDROP OF WHAT I HEAR IN THE

01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:00.935 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IN FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

01:38:58.566 --> 01:39:02.203 region:rollup2
OF. YOU KNOW THAT JUST THAT THE

01:39:00.935 --> 01:39:03.738 region:rollup2
OVERALL CRIME RATE AS SOME OF

01:39:02.203 --> 01:39:05.440 region:rollup2
THAT VIOLENT CRIMES AND THEY'RE

01:39:03.738 --> 01:39:07.241 region:rollup2
VERY CONCERNED A WITHOUT NOT

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.243 region:rollup2
ONLY THE.

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:10.678 region:rollup2
THE REPORTING BUT ALSO JUST THE

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:12.079 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND I THINK THIS IS AN

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:14.182 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THAT COULD BE.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:15.316 region:rollup2
POSITIVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME I

01:39:14.182 --> 01:39:16.717 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT FABULOUS WORKED AT

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:17.819 region:rollup2
THE.

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:19.320 region:rollup2
THE OFFICERS ARE DOING ON THE

01:39:17.819 --> 01:39:21.823 region:rollup2
STREETS AND AND FRANKLY I THINK

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.558 region:rollup2
A COMMAND STAFF IS IS DOING.

01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:24.392 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO WORK AND

01:39:23.558 --> 01:39:25.960 region:rollup2
IN AND FRANKLY IT TOUGH

01:39:24.392 --> 01:39:27.728 region:rollup2
SITUATION THIS LEGISLATURE'S

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:29.096 region:rollup2
MADE IT VERY VERY CHALLENGING

01:39:27.728 --> 01:39:31.199 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:32.533 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE WITH A PROP

01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:33.301 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN AND EIGHT ENDEAVOR

01:39:32.533 --> 01:39:35.870 region:rollup2
TO MAYBE ONE A NINE AND OF

01:39:33.301 --> 01:39:38.272 region:rollup2
COURSE PROP 47-57 THAT THE. THAT

01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:40.141 region:rollup2
THE ARM VOTERS HAVE APPROVED

01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:41.776 region:rollup2
IT'S MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:43.010 region:rollup2
FOR THESE POLICE AGENCIES AND SO

01:39:41.776 --> 01:39:44.479 region:rollup2
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.513 region:rollup2
HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED IN

01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:47.315 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO

01:39:45.513 --> 01:39:48.182 region:rollup2
GET THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED

01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:50.384 region:rollup2
IS A LEGISLATURE.

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:52.620 region:rollup2
TO TO HAVE THAT THE PROPER ON.

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:55.256 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:56.557 region:rollup2
AND AND I I HOPE IT'S NOT EVER

01:39:55.256 --> 01:39:58.159 region:rollup2
CONSTRUED AS ANY KIND OF OUR.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:59.660 region:rollup2
OF AN INDICTMENT OF WHAT'S

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:00.394 region:rollup2
HAPPENING YA INTERNALLY A

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.896 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

01:40:00.394 --> 01:40:02.997 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WITHOUT OF THE RANK

01:40:01.896 --> 01:40:04.432 region:rollup2
AND FILE OFFICERS ON THE STREET

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:05.666 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING A FABULOUS JOB I

01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:06.767 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THEM YOU KNOW ON A

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:08.369 region:rollup2
REGULAR BASIS.

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:09.704 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY ANNA A WHOLE LOT OF

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:11.339 region:rollup2
LIVE IN MY DISTRICT AND I AYE

01:40:09.704 --> 01:40:13.474 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH THEM REGULARLY AND

01:40:11.339 --> 01:40:15.376 region:rollup2
AYE HERE ISSUES THAT I THINK.

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:16.911 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN HELP

01:40:15.376 --> 01:40:18.646 region:rollup2
ADDRESS A NOT NECESSARILY

01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:19.247 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS AUDIT PROCESS

01:40:18.646 --> 01:40:20.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS A KIND OF A

01:40:19.247 --> 01:40:21.649 region:rollup2
SEPARATE ISSUE.

01:40:20.214 --> 01:40:22.950 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY.

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:24.252 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT WILL GIVE US AN

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:25.453 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A BASELINE

01:40:24.252 --> 01:40:26.954 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYONE IN THE STATE CAN

01:40:25.453 --> 01:40:28.756 region:rollup2
NOW TAKE A LOOK AT AND SAY WELL

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:30.157 region:rollup2
HERE'S SOME BEST PRACTICES HERE

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:32.159 region:rollup2
SOME THINGS THAT THAT WERE YOU

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:33.327 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WERE DONE VERY WELL BY

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:34.428 region:rollup2
LAPD AND I'M SURE THAT'S GOING

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:36.697 region:rollup2
TO BE. THE CASE.

01:40:34.428 --> 01:40:37.899 region:rollup2
AND AND ALSO IF WE HAVE AN

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:39.534 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATION THAT IT'S A FOUR

01:40:37.899 --> 01:40:40.368 region:rollup2
PERCENT TO SIX PERCENT OR TWENTY

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:41.602 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:42.703 region:rollup2
ERROR RATE WHATEVER IT HAPPENS

01:40:41.602 --> 01:40:45.172 region:rollup2
TO BE.

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:46.974 region:rollup2
WORK ON AND NOW HAVE THE FACTS

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:49.176 region:rollup2
AND I I WAS ONE AIR ON THE SIDE

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:50.611 region:rollup2
OF HAVING DATA. O. EVERYWHERE I

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:51.812 region:rollup2
I SAID IN THIS LEGISLATURE

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.914 region:rollup2
WHATEVER BODY AND WHATEVER

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:54.148 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IT'S ON I LIKE TO HAVE

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:55.182 region:rollup2
THE DATA AND I THINK THIS IS

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.784 region:rollup2
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:58.519 region:rollup2
THAT. BUT CERTAINLY AT A WITH

01:40:56.784 --> 01:41:00.755 region:rollup2
ALL RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:01.923 region:rollup2
OF THE LAPD I THINK THIS IS A

01:41:00.755 --> 01:41:03.758 region:rollup2
GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR.

01:41:01.923 --> 01:41:05.393 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:06.928 region:rollup2
GET THE INFORMATION AND I THINK

01:41:05.393 --> 01:41:08.329 region:rollup2
YOU OFFER YOU KNOW YOU'RE BRING

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:09.697 region:rollup2
IT FORWARD THANK YOU TO THE

01:41:08.329 --> 01:41:11.332 region:rollup2
AUTHOR'S NAME ONLY BRIEFLY.

01:41:09.697 --> 01:41:13.267 region:rollup2
CLARIFY A POINT THAT THE HON

01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:14.168 region:rollup2
THAT WAS JUST MADE UP FIRST WELL

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:15.336 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT SEE THIS AS

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:17.471 region:rollup2
ADVERSARIAL AS WELL.

01:41:15.336 --> 01:41:18.072 region:rollup2
I OVERSEE OUR OWN INTERNAL

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:20.041 region:rollup2
AUDIT THE VISION I UNDERSTAND

01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:21.943 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUDITING IS DIFFICULT

01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:23.077 region:rollup2
AND CHALLENGING SO WE DO NOT I

01:41:21.943 --> 01:41:24.679 region:rollup2
THINK OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:25.880 region:rollup2
WAS NO DISCUSSION WITH US TO

01:41:24.679 --> 01:41:26.914 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:29.116 region:rollup2
ARE. I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:31.619 region:rollup2
MISPERCEPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:33.754 region:rollup2
WAS INDICATED THAT THE CONCERN

01:41:31.619 --> 01:41:35.222 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE THE RELATIVE CRIME

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:37.391 region:rollup2
RATE AN ERROR RATE DOESN'T

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:38.893 region:rollup2
AFFECT THE RELATIVE CRIME RATE

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:40.528 region:rollup2
IF THE ERROR RATE IS RELATIVELY

01:41:38.893 --> 01:41:42.330 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT OVER TIME. THE

01:41:40.528 --> 01:41:44.065 region:rollup2
RELATIVE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN

01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:46.434 region:rollup2
CRIME DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU

01:41:44.065 --> 01:41:47.935 region:rollup2
HAVE A FIVE TEN PERCENT ERROR

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:49.170 region:rollup2
RATE YEAR TO YEAR AND THAT IS

01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:51.472 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THE INDEPENDENT

01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:53.841 region:rollup2
INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS FOUND SO

01:41:51.472 --> 01:41:57.411 region:rollup2
ARCTIC CRIME RATE REDUCTIONS

01:41:53.841 --> 01:42:00.147 region:rollup2
THAT INCREASES. ARE NOT AFFECTED

01:41:57.411 --> 01:42:04.752 region:rollup2
BY THAT ERROR RATE OF THE SECOND

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:08.589 region:rollup2
THING IS THAT. WE DO NOT USE FBI

01:42:04.752 --> 01:42:09.190 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATIONS TO TO DEPLOY

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:10.925 region:rollup2
RESOURCES

01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:12.126 region:rollup2
SO HOW WE CLASSIFY A CRIME UNDER

01:42:10.925 --> 01:42:13.494 region:rollup2
THE UC OUR SYSTEM HAS NO IMPACT

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:14.061 region:rollup2
ON HOW WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:15.129 region:rollup2
SHOOTINGS AND OTHER THINGS

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:16.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE. THE FBI SYSTEM OF

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:17.198 region:rollup2
REPORTING DOES NOT MARY OUR

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:18.432 region:rollup2
MATCH UP

01:42:17.198 --> 01:42:19.333 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE IN ANY

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:20.434 region:rollup2
WAY. SO THIS IS A WHOLE

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:21.235 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REPORTING SYSTEM

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S THERE AND I THINK OUR

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:23.804 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS COULD WE GET SOME

IT'S LACKEY WHICH LIKE CLOSE.

01:43:29.236 --> 01:43:31.939 region:rollup2

WELCOME AN AUDIT.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:42.750 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY.

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:44.251 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE

01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:45.186 region:rollup2
CONSENT DECREES TO COMPLY WITH

01:43:44.251 --> 01:43:48.656 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF.

01:43:45.186 --> 01:43:48.656 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES TO

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:51.992 region:rollup2
YOU THAT. THERE IS A PROTECT THE

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.960 region:rollup2
REASON WHY WE BROUGHT THIS

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.295 region:rollup2
FORWARD AT BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.298 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

01:43:54.295 --> 01:43:58.833 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF DOUBT THAT HAS BEEN A

01:43:57.298 --> 01:44:00.634 region:rollup2
PERMEATED IN THE MINDS OF MANY

01:43:58.833 --> 01:44:02.203 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS AND MANY PEOPLE

01:44:00.634 --> 01:44:03.304 region:rollup2
WHO RELY ON.

01:44:02.203 --> 01:44:04.772 region:rollup2
ON THE TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:44:03.304 --> 01:44:05.906 region:rollup2
AND AND.

01:44:04.772 --> 01:44:07.208 region:rollup2
BUT TYPICALLY LOS ANGELES POLICE

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:08.776 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:10.111 region:rollup2
AND AS A OF THE VICE CHAIR OF

01:44:08.776 --> 01:44:13.114 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE

01:44:10.111 --> 01:44:13.881 region:rollup2
RELY. ON GOOD STATISTICAL

01:44:13.114 --> 01:44:15.583 region:rollup2
INFORMATION TO MAKE GOOD PUBLIC

01:44:13.881 --> 01:44:17.952 region:rollup2
POLICY.

01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:19.086 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS CLEARLY A RESERVE

01:44:17.952 --> 01:44:20.654 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER A

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:23.090 region:rollup2
REASONABLE DOUBT OTHERWISE I

01:44:20.654 --> 01:44:24.825 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE HERE. I'M I GET NO

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:27.528 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION OUT OF BRINGING.

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:29.296 region:rollup2
THIS KIND OF CHALLENGE FORWARD

01:44:27.528 --> 01:44:30.698 region:rollup2
TO IT AT A DEPARTMENT THAT I

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:31.932 region:rollup2
HAVE GREAT ADMIRATION FOR HAVING

01:44:30.698 --> 01:44:32.967 region:rollup2
SERVED TWENTY YEARS A LOT FOR

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:34.568 region:rollup2
SOME MYSELF.

01:44:32.967 --> 01:44:36.170 region:rollup2
SO THERE IN MY OPINION AND THE

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:37.705 region:rollup2
REASON WHY WE'RE.

01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:39.340 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE TODAY IS

01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:40.841 region:rollup2
THERE IS A REASONABLE DOUBT. IN

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:41.909 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE MINDS OF MANY THAT I

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:43.077 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS AUDIT WOULD BE

01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:44.245 region:rollup2
ABLE.

01:44:43.077 --> 01:44:46.213 region:rollup2
TO BRING FORWARD AND TO

01:44:44.245 --> 01:44:47.915 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE AND I THINK IT'S VERY

01:44:46.213 --> 01:44:49.550 region:rollup2
CRITICAL THAT WE ELIMINATE THAT.

01:44:47.915 --> 01:44:51.252 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL OF DOUBT THAT'S BEEN

01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:55.289 region:rollup2
PERMEATING FOR A LONG TIME QUITE

01:44:51.252 --> 01:44:57.558 region:rollup2
HONESTLY. AND I I DON'T A.

01:44:55.289 --> 01:44:58.726 region:rollup2
WANT TO TO CREATE IT DID

01:44:57.558 --> 01:45:00.728 region:rollup2
A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I HAVE

01:44:58.726 --> 01:45:02.129 region:rollup2
ANYTHING TO GAIN FROM THIS OTHER

01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:03.531 region:rollup2
THAN GOOD INFORMATION THAT THE

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:05.699 region:rollup2

01:45:03.531 --> 01:45:07.201 region:rollup2
DESERVES AND WE TRULY NEED RIGHT

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:09.036 region:rollup2

ENFORCEMENT HAS.

01:45:09.036 --> 01:45:13.307 region:rollup2
THE A DISTRUST OF THEY DO AND

01:45:11.205 --> 01:45:14.241 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN ARGUABLE THAT WE NEED

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:16.210 region:rollup2
TO BUILD OUR OUR PUBLIC

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:18.012 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE NOT LEAVE IT THIS.

THE AUDIT WHEN WORK WHEN WERE

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:31.123 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S

MORE AT MY PERSPECTIVE ARE END

02:15:31.123 --> 02:15:34.126 region:rollup2
DOING THE ANALYSIS WOULD STAFF

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:35.794 region:rollup2
IS. LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC THE

02:15:34.126 --> 02:15:37.262 region:rollup2
POSITIVE HOPEFULLY IN MOST CASES

02:15:35.794 --> 02:15:38.697 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

02:15:38.697 --> 02:15:41.734 region:rollup2
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE IT'S

CURRENTLY BEING CONSTRUCTED AND

02:15:41.734 --> 02:15:45.571 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY AND FUTURE PHASES

02:15:43.736 --> 02:15:46.939 region:rollup2
OF ON HIGH SPEED RAIL SO WE

02:15:45.571 --> 02:15:48.173 region:rollup2
WEREN'T NECESSARILY LOOKING AT

02:15:46.939 --> 02:15:49.742 region:rollup2
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THAT IN THE

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:52.011 region:rollup2
PAST WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT. THE

02:15:49.742 --> 02:15:53.479 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN FOR THE HIGH SPEED

02:15:52.011 --> 02:15:55.180 region:rollup2
RAIL AUTHORITY THE FIRST AUDIT

02:15:53.479 --> 02:15:56.749 region:rollup2
THAT WE DID OPT SEVERAL YEARS

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:58.684 region:rollup2
AGO NOW LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS

02:15:56.749 --> 02:16:00.753 region:rollup2
PLAN AND LOOKED AT. FINANCING

02:15:58.684 --> 02:16:03.122 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THE EXPECTATIONS AS

02:16:00.753 --> 02:16:05.391 region:rollup2
FAR AS FEDERAL MONEY COMING AND

02:16:03.122 --> 02:16:06.625 region:rollup2
THE RIDERSHIP ARE HOW MUCH.

02:16:05.391 --> 02:16:08.093 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:10.763 region:rollup2
GENERATED REVENUE GENERATED FROM

02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:11.997 region:rollup2
RIDERSHIP WOULD HELP PAY FOR THE

02:16:10.763 --> 02:16:14.366 region:rollup2
SYSTEM PARTICULAR MAINTENANCE

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:15.601 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS ONGOING I DON'T SEE

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:17.970 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE. CURRENT SCOPE AND

02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:19.772 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES THIS IS MORE ABOUT

02:16:17.970 --> 02:16:22.274 region:rollup2
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT CHANGE

02:16:19.772 --> 02:16:24.209 region:rollup2
ORDERS AND THEN. CONTRACTING

02:16:22.274 --> 02:16:25.811 region:rollup2
WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THE

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:28.380 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN DERIVED

02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:29.381 region:rollup2
FROM THAT NOT NECESSARILY

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.716 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT.

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:32.618 region:rollup2
AND THE SYSTEM WILL BE.

02:16:30.716 --> 02:16:33.652 region:rollup2
WILL NOT NEED SUBSIDIES FROM

02:16:32.618 --> 02:16:36.422 region:rollup2
EITHER STATER OR FEDERAL.

02:16:33.652 --> 02:16:38.691 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

02:16:36.422 --> 02:16:40.292 region:rollup2
OKAY FAULT BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO

02:16:38.691 --> 02:16:41.160 region:rollup2
BE CYNICAL BUT IF IT SEEMS LIKE

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:42.161 region:rollup2
A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY FOR

02:16:42.161 --> 02:16:43.595 region:rollup2
LARGE MATTER CONSTRUCTION

02:16:42.694 --> 02:16:45.664 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:46.331 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:47.900 region:rollup2
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL GOES

02:16:46.331 --> 02:16:49.968 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THAT THE ANSWER IS

02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:52.337 region:rollup2
CLEARLY YES AND MAYBE QUITE

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:52.938 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY. HOW MUCH

02:16:52.337 --> 02:16:53.906 region:rollup2
SO KNOW EVER I DON'T THINK I

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:55.307 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ALONE IN OPINING THAT

02:16:53.906 --> 02:16:56.275 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO UNDERTAKEN

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:57.843 region:rollup2

ENTRUSTED IN.

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:05.551 region:rollup2
AN EVALUATION OF THE QUESTION OF

02:18:17.689 --> 02:18:20.559 region:rollup2
OF THEIR ANALYSIS OF THE

TO ANY ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS

02:18:31.036 --> 02:18:33.238 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:34.439 region:rollup2
IT GOES TO THE HEART OF THE

02:18:33.238 --> 02:18:36.542 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:38.277 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. IS

02:18:36.542 --> 02:18:39.978 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY BENEFICIAL FOR THE

02:18:38.277 --> 02:18:42.347 region:rollup2
STATE IF IT CAN SELF SUSTAIN ITS

02:18:39.978 --> 02:18:43.749 region:rollup2
OPERATION. THAT'S ALSO THE BASIS

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:45.617 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW AS A BUSINESSMAN

02:18:43.749 --> 02:18:47.286 region:rollup2

THAT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

02:18:49.188 --> 02:18:52.724 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION.

02:18:50.989 --> 02:18:53.892 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD BE HAVING THAT

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:54.693 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH YOU WHETHER

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.961 region:rollup2

THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY

02:19:09.308 --> 02:19:13.312 region:rollup2

CAST SOME LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE

02:19:15.147 --> 02:19:19.017 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO DO

02:19:16.014 --> 02:19:20.886 region:rollup2
AN AUDIT LET'S DO A THOROUGH ON

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:21.486 region:rollup2

02:19:28.794 --> 02:19:31.763 region:rollup2
TWO QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SO

02:19:30.329 --> 02:19:33.699 region:rollup2
IN THE QUESTION FIRST ONE AND

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:35.033 region:rollup2
THEY'RE A FOR THE AUDITOR.

02:19:33.699 --> 02:19:37.202 region:rollup2
IT FOLLOWS UP ON OUR COLLEAGUES

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:37.769 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THOROUGH THE

02:19:37.202 --> 02:19:39.838 region:rollup2
OUT IT COULD BE BECAUSE WE

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:41.573 region:rollup2
REALLY. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:43.041 region:rollup2
NOT SETTING FORTH AN AUDIT THAT

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:45.177 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY HAS A FOREGONE

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:47.613 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION BUT JEN'S UP.

02:19:45.177 --> 02:19:50.015 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE SIDE <u>. AND WITH</u>

02:19:47.613 --> 02:19:51.984 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

02:19:50.015 --> 02:19:53.185 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL CAN HAVE A

02:19:51.984 --> 02:19:54.519 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS VERY

02:19:53.185 --> 02:19:55.087 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IN TELLING THAT IT'S

02:19:54.519 --> 02:19:57.656 region:rollup2
IT'S HAVING A REAL IMPACT.

02:19:55.087 --> 02:19:58.957 region:rollup2
.

02:19:57.656 --> 02:20:00.259 region:rollup2
DOES DUTY BOUND MODERATE DOES

02:19:58.957 --> 02:20:02.527 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR'S WRITTEN GIVE YOU

02:20:00.259 --> 02:20:04.229 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT. NOT JUST

02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:06.265 region:rollup2
THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S HAVING

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:06.798 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING

02:20:06.265 --> 02:20:07.899 region:rollup2
SPENT ARE NOT BEING SPENT

02:20:06.798 --> 02:20:09.234 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE.

02:20:07.899 --> 02:20:09.901 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE

02:20:09.234 --> 02:20:11.103 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE SPENDING THE DOLLARS

02:20:09.901 --> 02:20:12.804 region:rollup2
IN THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY WE

02:20:11.103 --> 02:20:15.040 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY CAN.

02:20:12.804 --> 02:20:18.076 region:rollup2
AND AND GETTING THE BEST RETURN

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:19.177 region:rollup2
FOR TAXPAYER DOLLARS NOW. ARE I

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:20.178 region:rollup2
IN THAT SPIRIT OF ONE MAKE SURE

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:20.979 region:rollup2
IT'S A THOROUGH AUDIT.

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.581 region:rollup2
WONDER IF YOU HAVE THE

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:23.782 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO NOT JUST LOOK AT

02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:24.650 region:rollup2
HERE'S HOW MANY JOBS HAVE BEEN

02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:25.684 region:rollup2
CREATED HERE'S THE ECONOMIC

02:20:24.650 --> 02:20:27.152 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY AS A RESULT OF HIGH

02:20:25.684 --> 02:20:28.520 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL.

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:30.289 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY OR

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:32.324 region:rollup2
FREEDOM OR.

02:20:30.289 --> 02:20:33.525 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY OR YOU COULD SAY

02:20:32.324 --> 02:20:35.460 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S WHERE COULD HAVE BEEN

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:36.762 region:rollup2
SPENT FOR THIS WAS THE BEST WAY

02:20:35.460 --> 02:20:39.631 region:rollup2
TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE

02:20:36.762 --> 02:20:42.734 region:rollup2
THAT'S EVEN MORE VALUABLE TO US

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:43.235 region:rollup2
AS A. AS A BODY.

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:45.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

02:20:43.235 --> 02:20:47.105 region:rollup2
.

02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:48.006 region:rollup2
THAT AS I INDICATED. IN THE AND

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:49.975 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE IT WOULDN'T

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:50.542 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BE CONTEMPLATED IN

02:20:49.975 --> 02:20:51.310 region:rollup2
THE SCOPE OF THE OUGHT RIGHT

02:20:50.542 --> 02:20:53.545 region:rollup2
NOW.

02:20:51.310 --> 02:20:55.814 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE COULD LOOK AT THE

02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:56.815 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:58.550 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT AND

02:20:56.815 --> 02:21:00.118 region:rollup2
AS MISTER RICHARDS INDICATED

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.920 region:rollup2
THERE SOME CAP AND TRADE MONEY.

02:21:00.118 --> 02:21:03.388 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY THERE'S POLICY

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.489 region:rollup2
DECISIONS AS TO WHAT.

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:06.491 region:rollup2
CAPTAIN TRADE MONEY COULD BE

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:08.694 region:rollup2
USED FOR I THINK WHAT WE WOULD

02:21:06.491 --> 02:21:10.796 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THIS.

02:21:08.694 --> 02:21:11.963 region:rollup2
AUDIT IS LOOK AT HOW THE HIGH

02:21:10.796 --> 02:21:13.732 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS USING

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:14.800 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FUNDING

02:21:13.732 --> 02:21:16.168 region:rollup2
AND THE BENEFIT THAT'S BEING

02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:18.303 region:rollup2
DERIVED FROM THAT I DON'T THINK

02:21:16.168 --> 02:21:20.605 region:rollup2
WE COULD NECESSARILY. APPLYING

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:21.974 region:rollup2
OR MAKE A DETERMINATION WELL

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:23.875 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE BETTER

02:21:21.974 --> 02:21:26.445 region:rollup2
BEEN BETTER SPENT FIXING ROADS

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:27.979 region:rollup2
OUR BRIDGES OR WHATEVER OR

02:21:26.445 --> 02:21:30.215 region:rollup2
INVESTING IN SOME OTHER.

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:31.383 region:rollup2
POLICY AREA ON THE STATE OF

02:21:30.215 --> 02:21:32.784 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK.

02:21:31.383 --> 02:21:34.386 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED

02:21:32.784 --> 02:21:36.188 region:rollup2
FOR IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT

02:21:34.386 --> 02:21:37.989 region:rollup2
BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN LOOK AT THE

02:21:36.188 --> 02:21:39.825 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT THE AUTHORITY IS

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:41.259 region:rollup2
USING AND HOW IS THAT MONEY

02:21:39.825 --> 02:21:43.562 region:rollup2
BEING INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:21:41.259 --> 02:21:45.130 region:rollup2
IS THERE. AN ECONOMIC BENEFIT

02:21:43.562 --> 02:21:46.798 region:rollup2
SHORT TERM AND CERTAINLY LONG

02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:48.600 region:rollup2
TERM OKAY WHAT WOULD WOULD.

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:50.268 region:rollup2
A I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT I I

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:51.169 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE US AS A BODY TO MAKE

02:21:50.268 --> 02:21:52.437 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CONSIDER THAT AS

02:21:51.169 --> 02:21:54.239 region:rollup2
WELL. WHICH IS THERE'S AN

02:21:52.437 --> 02:21:56.007 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY COST FOR EVERY

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:57.943 region:rollup2
DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT AND YOU

02:21:56.007 --> 02:21:59.244 region:rollup2
HAVE GOT A VERY LONG LIST OF

02:21:57.943 --> 02:22:01.079 region:rollup2
OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS

02:21:59.244 --> 02:22:02.347 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD BE HAVING A GREAT

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:03.548 region:rollup2
RETURN ON THE DEPTH OF MOBILITY

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:04.783 region:rollup2
AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:06.118 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

02:22:04.783 --> 02:22:07.486 region:rollup2
AND THOSE DOLLARS ARE GONNA GO

02:22:06.118 --> 02:22:09.221 region:rollup2
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:22:07.486 --> 02:22:10.122 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S A LENS

02:22:09.221 --> 02:22:11.223 region:rollup2
THROUGH WHICH WE NEED TO DO THAT

02:22:10.122 --> 02:22:13.024 region:rollup2
I WISH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE THE

02:22:11.223 --> 02:22:13.592 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:15.093 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:22:13.592 --> 02:22:16.161 region:rollup2
ALSO ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:18.730 region:rollup2
IMPACTS

02:22:16.161 --> 02:22:19.965 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT

02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.665 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL HAVING THE

02:22:19.965 --> 02:22:23.268 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL THESE FROM ITS

02:22:20.665 --> 02:22:24.069 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES.

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:25.003 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:22:24.069 --> 02:22:26.405 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS A TO REDUCE

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:28.306 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES AND YOU HAVE A

02:22:26.405 --> 02:22:30.108 region:rollup2
POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:31.676 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS MORE HOW

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:33.779 region:rollup2
YOUR GOING TO BE EQUIPPED TO

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:34.980 region:rollup2
DETERMINES THAT THOSE.

02:22:33.779 --> 02:22:36.048 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ARE REAL

02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:37.816 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO

02:22:36.048 --> 02:22:39.384 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES AND THAT IT IS

02:22:37.816 --> 02:22:40.886 region:rollup2
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:42.587 region:rollup2
I THAT IS HAVING THAT POSITIVE

02:22:40.886 --> 02:22:44.089 region:rollup2
IMPACT IF THERE IS ONE AND NOT

02:22:42.587 --> 02:22:45.957 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:22:44.089 --> 02:22:48.093 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT CAN WAY AND BECAUSE

02:22:45.957 --> 02:22:49.428 region:rollup2
WE ARE AS A STATE RIGHTLY SO

02:22:48.093 --> 02:22:50.328 region:rollup2
TACKLING GREENHOUSE GAS

02:22:49.428 --> 02:22:51.530 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS AND I THINK

02:22:50.328 --> 02:22:53.398 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:54.900 region:rollup2
DOING THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:22:53.398 --> 02:22:56.301 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T ASCRIBE TO HIGH

02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:57.335 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL REDUCTIONS IN

02:22:56.301 --> 02:22:57.803 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:58.603 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE HAD NO CAUSAL

02:22:57.803 --> 02:23:00.405 region:rollup2
CONNECTION.

02:22:58.603 --> 02:23:01.740 region:rollup2
CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT PLEASE

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:02.407 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE'S AN OBJECTIVE

02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:04.409 region:rollup2
IN THE AUDIT.

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:05.610 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT TALKS ABOUT

02:23:04.409 --> 02:23:06.578 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY AND CERTAINLY

02:23:05.610 --> 02:23:08.480 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ECONOMIC AND

02:23:06.578 --> 02:23:10.282 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THAT

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:11.716 region:rollup2
THE WAY TO THE OBJECTIVE RIGHT

02:23:10.282 --> 02:23:12.918 region:rollup2
NOW IS CRAFTED IS TO START WITH

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:14.319 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITIES EFFORTS TO

02:23:12.918 --> 02:23:16.087 region:rollup2
EVALUATE TO WE WOULD HAVE TO

02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:17.823 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE MAY NEED

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:19.791 region:rollup2
TO HIRE AN EXPERT TO ASSIST US

02:23:17.823 --> 02:23:22.661 region:rollup2
IN THE* AND ALSO DETERMINING

02:23:19.791 --> 02:23:23.862 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN ISOLATE

02:23:22.661 --> 02:23:25.730 region:rollup2
THEY ECONOMIC I MEAN THE

02:23:23.862 --> 02:23:27.132 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT HIGH

02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:28.633 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL WILL BRING TO THE

02:23:27.132 --> 02:23:31.303 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE YOU

02:23:28.633 --> 02:23:33.805 region:rollup2
ABLE TO AS OR IS THE STATE OR

02:23:31.303 --> 02:23:35.874 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY ABLE TO. ISOLATE

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:37.909 region:rollup2
THAT IMPACT AND IF THEY THEY'RE

02:23:35.874 --> 02:23:39.411 region:rollup2
CLAIMING TO THEN HAVE SOMEONE

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:42.280 region:rollup2
ASSIST US IN DOING AN ANALYSIS

02:23:39.411 --> 02:23:43.949 region:rollup2
THAT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:46.251 region:rollup2
EVALUATION IS.

02:23:43.949 --> 02:23:47.919 region:rollup2
REASONABLE OP I THINK THAT IS

02:23:46.251 --> 02:23:48.620 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH THAT WE WOULD TAKE

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:51.022 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT TIME.

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:52.891 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PARTICULAR OBJECTIVE

02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:53.859 region:rollup2
OKAY BECAUSE I I I THINK THAT'S

02:23:52.891 --> 02:23:55.460 region:rollup2
GONNA BE CRITICAL ON THAT FOR IN

02:23:53.859 --> 02:23:57.796 region:rollup2
ORDER FOR THIS TO HAVE A RESULT

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:59.631 region:rollup2
AT THE END THAT IS USEFUL TO US.

02:23:57.796 --> 02:24:01.233 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S HERE'S WHAT WE NEED

02:23:59.631 --> 02:24:03.335 region:rollup2
TO DO FOR CALIFORNIA AND HERE'S

02:24:01.233 --> 02:24:04.636 region:rollup2
THE POSITIVE IMPACT HAS IT IS

02:24:03.335 --> 02:24:06.104 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL THAT. YOU HAVE THE

02:24:04.636 --> 02:24:08.707 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT AND I

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:09.341 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE IT. AND THAT THOSE OF

02:24:08.707 --> 02:24:09.641 region:rollup2
THE TWO QUESTIONS BUT ALSO JUST

02:24:09.341 --> 02:24:11.276 region:rollup2
THE COMET.

02:24:09.641 --> 02:24:12.544 region:rollup2
.

02:24:11.276 --> 02:24:13.945 region:rollup2
EVERY RED FLAG YOU COULD

02:24:12.544 --> 02:24:16.314 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY RAISE ABOUT A PUBLIC

02:24:13.945 --> 02:24:17.048 region:rollup2
WORKS PROJECT.

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:19.417 region:rollup2
IS REYES WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:21.653 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL AND IT'S NOT THROUGH.

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:24.089 region:rollup2
A BAD ACTORS IT'S IT'S JUST A

02:24:21.653 --> 02:24:25.290 region:rollup2
FACT WHETHER IT'S COST OVERRUNS

02:24:24.089 --> 02:24:26.725 region:rollup2
CHANGE ORDERS IN THE COSTS THAT

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:28.960 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD FOR THE PROJECT.

02:24:26.725 --> 02:24:30.729 region:rollup2
AND THE LITIGATION IMPACTS AND

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.397 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE SO I I'M PLEASED TO

02:24:30.729 --> 02:24:33.465 region:rollup2
SEE A AND AUDIT THAT IS

02:24:32.397 --> 02:24:35.166 region:rollup2

UNIQUE BIPARTISANSHIP TO THIS

02:24:38.603 --> 02:24:41.606 region:rollup2
REQUEST THAT WE DON'T OFTEN SEE

02:24:40.272 --> 02:24:43.875 region:rollup2
WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. IT'S

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:45.110 region:rollup2
ALARMING THE RED FLAGS THAT GET

02:24:43.875 --> 02:24:46.711 region:rollup2
REYES WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND

02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:49.147 region:rollup2

02:25:36.828 --> 02:25:39.664 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN.

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:41.199 region:rollup2
QUICK.

02:25:39.664 --> 02:25:43.101 region:rollup2
BUT I. THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:25:41.199 --> 02:25:44.970 region:rollup2
UP TO RESPOND TO US.

02:25:43.101 --> 02:25:45.804 region:rollup2
THE BI PARTISANSHIP HERE THE

02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:48.540 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN

02:25:45.804 --> 02:25:51.076 region:rollup2
RAISED.

02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:52.944 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO DO?

02:25:51.076 --> 02:25:55.380 region:rollup2
IS TO GET PAST ALL OF THE NOISE

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:57.282 region:rollup2
TO GET PAST ALL OF THE POLITICS.

02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:59.384 region:rollup2
TO GET DOWN INTO A THOROUGH

02:25:57.282 --> 02:26:01.353 region:rollup2
AUDIT THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US A

02:25:59.384 --> 02:26:02.654 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD HEADS UP. AS TO WHAT

02:26:01.353 --> 02:26:03.221 region:rollup2
IS IT IS THAT'S WHAT IS COMING

02:26:02.654 --> 02:26:06.191 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAS.

02:26:03.221 --> 02:26:07.993 region:rollup2
HAS HAPPENED.

02:26:06.191 --> 02:26:08.526 region:rollup2
IN A BIPARTISAN WAY WE HAVE MADE

02:26:07.993 --> 02:26:10.262 region:rollup2
AN UNDERSTANDING WITH ONE

02:26:08.526 --> 02:26:10.762 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

02:26:10.262 --> 02:26:12.797 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL KEEP TO THAT

02:26:10.762 --> 02:26:15.300 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

02:26:12.797 --> 02:26:15.900 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I NEED TO POINT OUT THAT

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:18.203 region:rollup2
AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS MENTIONED

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:20.005 region:rollup2
AND. NOT TO PUT.

02:26:18.203 --> 02:26:21.339 region:rollup2
WORDS IN HIS MOUTH AT ALL.

02:26:20.005 --> 02:26:22.707 region:rollup2
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

02:26:21.339 --> 02:26:24.075 region:rollup2
SERIOUS

02:26:22.707 --> 02:26:26.144 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:27.846 region:rollup2
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:26:26.144 --> 02:26:29.114 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT HELPS US GET THERE.

02:26:27.846 --> 02:26:30.682 region:rollup2
I WILL BE LOOKING.

02:26:29.114 --> 02:26:32.684 region:rollup2
GENUINELY

02:26:30.682 --> 02:26:34.686 region:rollup2
FOR THIS BUSINESS PLAN WITH NEW

02:26:32.684 --> 02:26:36.054 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

02:26:34.686 --> 02:26:37.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR ME THE BIG QUESTION

02:26:36.054 --> 02:26:39.324 region:rollup2
HERE IS.

02:26:37.322 --> 02:26:41.292 region:rollup2
WITH THE COST.

02:26:39.324 --> 02:26:43.895 region:rollup2
EXPLODING.

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:46.064 region:rollup2
AND THE FINANCES FINITE.

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:48.066 region:rollup2
IS THERE ENOUGH MONEY.

02:26:46.064 --> 02:26:50.502 region:rollup2
A COMPLETE

02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:51.836 region:rollup2
FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.

02:26:50.502 --> 02:26:53.071 region:rollup2
I INTO THE SILICON VALLEY I I

02:26:51.836 --> 02:26:55.073 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE SOME REAL

02:26:53.071 --> 02:26:57.242 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT.

02:26:55.073 --> 02:26:58.943 region:rollup2
AND SO YES THE AUDIT DOES HAVE

02:26:57.242 --> 02:27:00.245 region:rollup2
SOME OF ADDRESS SOME OF THAT.

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:02.380 region:rollup2
BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:27:00.245 --> 02:27:02.881 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THERE WILL BE WITH NEW

02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:04.449 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES AND WITH NEW.

02:27:02.881 --> 02:27:06.618 region:rollup2
.

02:27:04.449 --> 02:27:08.319 region:rollup2
A AT THE END OF A NEW LOOK.

02:27:06.618 --> 02:27:10.355 region:rollup2
BY THOSE NEW EXECUTIVES.

02:27:08.319 --> 02:27:11.289 region:rollup2
FOR THIS BUSINESS PLAN.

02:27:10.355 --> 02:27:12.791 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

02:27:11.289 --> 02:27:13.892 region:rollup2
REAL OPPORTUNITY.

02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:15.894 region:rollup2
TO TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT THAT

02:27:13.892 --> 02:27:18.063 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN.

02:27:15.894 --> 02:27:18.863 region:rollup2
AND I AM HOPING AND I BELIEVE.

02:27:18.063 --> 02:27:20.265 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WILL BE A GOOD FAITH

02:27:18.863 --> 02:27:22.600 region:rollup2
EFFORT.

02:27:20.265 --> 02:27:25.103 region:rollup2
TO DEMONSTRATE WHETHER YOU CAN

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:26.538 region:rollup2
OR CANNOT GET INTO SAN JOSE.

02:27:25.103 --> 02:27:27.772 region:rollup2
THIS IS FOR FOR CENTRAL

02:27:26.538 --> 02:27:29.874 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT AT

02:27:27.772 --> 02:27:32.577 region:rollup2
STAKE HERE.

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:34.179 region:rollup2
A. BROTHER YOU'RE FOR IT OR

02:27:32.577 --> 02:27:35.547 region:rollup2
AGAINST IT A YEAR AGO YOU'RE AT

02:27:34.179 --> 02:27:36.648 region:rollup2
NONCOMMITTAL THE WORST THING

02:27:35.547 --> 02:27:37.982 region:rollup2
THAT CAN POSSIBLY HAPPEN IS IF

02:27:36.648 --> 02:27:39.651 region:rollup2
THE BUT IF WE WITH WE STARTED IN

02:27:37.982 --> 02:27:41.886 region:rollup2
A FIELD OUTSIDE BAKERSFIELD AND

02:27:39.651 --> 02:27:44.322 region:rollup2
ENDED. IN A FIELD OUTSIDE MERCED

02:27:41.886 --> 02:27:46.758 region:rollup2
SO COMPLETION REALLY DOES BRING

02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:48.827 region:rollup2
THE FULL FRUITS OF.

02:27:46.758 --> 02:27:50.628 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE A ARE ARE HEARING

HERE FROM THIS BIPARTISAN

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:53.431 region:rollup2
GROUP SO I'M REALLY GOING TO

02:27:52.263 --> 02:27:54.532 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD TO DIGGING IN I'M

02:27:53.431 --> 02:27:55.867 region:rollup2
GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL

BULLDOG SPARTAN ALLIANCE.

02:30:13.071 --> 02:30:17.342 region:rollup2

EVERY OTHER YEAR.

02:30:23.915 --> 02:30:27.118 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:30:24.382 --> 02:30:29.420 region:rollup2
THERE IS A A SANERGY IN

02:30:27.118 --> 02:30:31.489 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS.

02:30:29.420 --> 02:30:34.492 region:rollup2
AND THE BUSINESS SENSE.

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:36.628 region:rollup2
OF CONNECTING SILICON VALLEY.

02:30:34.492 --> 02:30:38.897 region:rollup2
WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:30:36.628 --> 02:30:42.400 region:rollup2
AND.

02:30:38.897 --> 02:30:44.469 region:rollup2
THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:47.071 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY THAT'S

02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:47.906 region:rollup2
IMMENSE.

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:50.708 region:rollup2
AND.

02:30:47.906 --> 02:30:52.343 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT APPLE AND.

02:30:50.708 --> 02:30:53.912 region:rollup2
INTEL AND.

02:30:52.343 --> 02:30:55.413 region:rollup2
ALL THE GREAT COMPANIES THAT WE

02:30:53.912 --> 02:30:56.247 region:rollup2
HAVE IN SILICON VALLEY THERE IN

02:30:55.413 --> 02:30:58.917 region:rollup2
MY DISTRICT.

02:30:56.247 --> 02:31:01.219 region:rollup2
.

02:30:58.917 --> 02:31:04.155 region:rollup2
IT IS IT IS IT IS IT IS A

02:31:01.219 --> 02:31:05.290 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY. IT DOESN'T EXIST

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:07.625 region:rollup2
UNLESS THERE'S A TRUCK.

02:31:05.290 --> 02:31:09.928 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

02:31:07.625 --> 02:31:12.063 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

02:31:09.928 --> 02:31:14.232 region:rollup2
IT HASN'T EXIST IN THE PAST I

02:31:12.063 --> 02:31:16.000 region:rollup2
WON'T EXIST IN THE FUTURE.

02:31:14.232 --> 02:31:18.736 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE HAVE IT ADEQUATE.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.505 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:22.707 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I THINK THE ECONOMY.

02:31:20.505 --> 02:31:25.910 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS.

02:31:22.707 --> 02:31:27.278 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY DRIVES RIDERSHIP.

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:30.448 region:rollup2
AND RIDERSHIP DRIVES THE

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:33.184 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL.

02:31:30.448 --> 02:31:35.186 region:rollup2
HIM IMPACT IN TERMS OF.

02:31:33.184 --> 02:31:37.422 region:rollup2
COST PER RIDER AND IN TERMS OF.

02:31:35.186 --> 02:31:39.157 region:rollup2
.

02:31:37.422 --> 02:31:40.959 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE NOT A SUBSIDY IS NEEDED

02:31:39.157 --> 02:31:42.293 region:rollup2
GO? AND SO FORTH AND I THINK.

02:31:40.959 --> 02:31:42.760 region:rollup2
TILL WE.

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:45.797 region:rollup2

SYMBOL SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

02:31:47.165 --> 02:31:50.368 region:rollup2
.

02:31:48.633 --> 02:31:51.235 region:rollup2
THEY CAN CERTAINLY AYE I WOULD

02:31:50.368 --> 02:31:52.603 region:rollup2
ASK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:54.772 region:rollup2

.

02:31:57.408 --> 02:32:00.345 region:rollup2
THAT THEY FOCUS ON BECAUSE THE

MAYBE GIVE US SPECIAL ATTENTION

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:08.052 region:rollup2
MAYBE HAVE SOME INDEPENDENT

MONTHS.

02:32:16.127 --> 02:32:20.264 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:21.499 region:rollup2
CHAU IT'LL PROBABLY BE A RANGE.

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:22.967 region:rollup2
NO BECAUSE A PROJECTS NOT TO BE

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:24.469 region:rollup2

RANGER GOING HAVE A.

02:32:31.109 --> 02:32:33.745 region:rollup2
IT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.613 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:33.745 --> 02:32:37.248 region:rollup2
THE BULLDOGS CAN'T COME TO SAN

02:32:35.613 --> 02:32:39.617 region:rollup2
JOSE AND THE SAN JOSE CAN'T COME

02:32:37.248 --> 02:32:41.019 region:rollup2
TO THE BULLDOGS. OF THAT COULD

02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:42.086 region:rollup2
BE THE LOW END OF THE RANGE THE

02:32:41.019 --> 02:32:43.154 region:rollup2
HIGH AND THE RANGE IS WHAT I'M

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:45.223 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE

02:32:43.154 --> 02:32:46.491 region:rollup2

02:33:59.797 --> 02:34:03.768 region:rollup2
MISS HOWELL.

02:34:00.131 --> 02:34:05.603 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR MENTIONED A ABOUT A

02:34:03.768 --> 02:34:07.138 region:rollup2
RULE ABOUT AMENDING AUDITS

BOB.

02:34:11.375 --> 02:34:15.780 region:rollup2
YEAH AND OF COURSE ANY WE RULE

02:34:13.077 --> 02:34:16.414 region:rollup2
CAN BE WAY WE JUST WAVED ONE A

02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:17.949 region:rollup2
LITTLE LITTLE BIT AGO ANOTHER ON

02:34:16.414 --> 02:34:18.649 region:rollup2
IT.

02:34:17.949 --> 02:34:20.451 region:rollup2
A TO A MOVE CONSENT COUNTER.

02:34:18.649 --> 02:34:23.588 region:rollup2
.

02:34:20.451 --> 02:34:25.957 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE THE THE THE ALL THE

02:34:23.588 --> 02:34:26.624 region:rollup2
STE DOES TALK ABOUT.

02:34:25.957 --> 02:34:28.226 region:rollup2
THE.

02:34:26.624 --> 02:34:30.061 region:rollup2
WHETHER NOT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:34:28.226 --> 02:34:31.429 region:rollup2
SELF SUSTAINING OUT ABOUT THIS

02:34:30.061 --> 02:34:32.263 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:33.731 region:rollup2
INVOLVED GREED THAT THAT'S

02:34:32.263 --> 02:34:35.900 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE REALLY NEED THIS

02:34:33.731 --> 02:34:38.102 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN. THAT SEEMS TO ME

02:34:35.900 --> 02:34:39.237 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN AMENDED IN NEEDS

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:41.539 region:rollup2
TO BE AMENDED AGAIN.

02:34:39.237 --> 02:34:43.107 region:rollup2
IT WAS SOLD TO THE PUBLIC IN A

02:34:41.539 --> 02:34:46.778 region:rollup2
CERTAIN WAY THIS THIS YOU KNOW.

02:34:43.107 --> 02:34:48.813 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSITION AND NOW IT

02:34:46.778 --> 02:34:50.314 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE WERE WERE THE OTHER

02:34:48.813 --> 02:34:51.449 region:rollup2
THAT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE

02:34:50.314 --> 02:34:52.984 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AND WORK GOING

02:34:51.449 --> 02:34:55.052 region:rollup2
BACKWARD SAYING IS THIS EVEN

02:34:52.984 --> 02:34:56.454 region:rollup2
VIABLE. DO YOU SEE IT POSSIBLE

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:58.556 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT

02:34:56.454 --> 02:35:01.359 region:rollup2
WITHOUT MATERIALLY CHANGING.

02:34:58.556 --> 02:35:02.059 region:rollup2
THE COST THE TIME FRAME IT

02:35:01.359 --> 02:35:04.128 region:rollup2
CETERA.

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:06.764 region:rollup2
THIS AUDIT BEING ABLE TO

02:35:04.128 --> 02:35:09.033 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASS WHETHER OR NOT HIGH

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:11.335 region:rollup2
SPEED RAIL. AYE IS SELF

02:35:09.033 --> 02:35:11.869 region:rollup2
SUSTAINING AND I HAVE A. COMMENT

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:14.172 region:rollup2
OR FOLLOW UP AFTER THAT.

02:35:11.869 --> 02:35:15.940 region:rollup2
FOR ME.

02:35:14.172 --> 02:35:18.042 region:rollup2
WELL AS I AS I INDICATED.

02:35:15.940 --> 02:35:19.110 region:rollup2
MR CUSTER WERE WITH MR ARE

02:35:18.042 --> 02:35:20.011 region:rollup2
OBERNOLTE QUESTION IT IT ISN'T

02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:21.179 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED IN THE CURRENT

02:35:20.011 --> 02:35:22.747 region:rollup2
SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES.

02:35:21.179 --> 02:35:24.949 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL

02:35:22.747 --> 02:35:26.517 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE BOMB I THINK WHAT WE

02:35:24.949 --> 02:35:27.685 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO DO AND MISTER

02:35:26.517 --> 02:35:28.986 region:rollup2
RICHARD I THINK INDICATED THE

02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:30.822 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN WAS COMING OUT IN

02:35:28.986 --> 02:35:32.356 region:rollup2
APRIL OR MAY PERHAPS. IT WOULD

02:35:30.822 --> 02:35:33.958 region:rollup2
BE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE WOULD

02:35:32.356 --> 02:35:35.693 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO OVER AND ABOVE WHAT'S

02:35:33.958 --> 02:35:36.994 region:rollup2
IN HERE. DETERMINING WHETHER OR%

02:35:35.693 --> 02:35:38.329 region:rollup2
NOT IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:40.131 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S.

02:35:38.329 --> 02:35:41.799 region:rollup2
A NEW OBJECTIVE.

02:35:40.131 --> 02:35:43.601 region:rollup2
I THINK THE COMMITTEE YOU. KNOW

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:45.670 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO DECIDE IF THAT'S

02:35:43.601 --> 02:35:45.937 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND MEMBER. WANTED TO

02:35:45.670 --> 02:35:47.572 region:rollup2
AMEND IT.

02:35:45.937 --> 02:35:48.840 region:rollup2
.

02:35:47.572 --> 02:35:50.308 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY COULD LOOK AT THE

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:52.276 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN BUT IF YOU WANTED

02:35:50.308 --> 02:35:54.879 region:rollup2
US TO DO YOU ANALYSIS SIMILAR TO

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:56.480 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DID IN OUR PRIOR AUDIT.

02:35:54.879 --> 02:35:57.982 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THIS. A FAIR AMOUNT OF

02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:00.284 region:rollup2
WORK AS FAR AS LOOKING AT THE

02:35:57.982 --> 02:36:02.687 region:rollup2
BUSINESS PLAN AYE UNDERSTANDING

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:03.621 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES

02:36:02.687 --> 02:36:05.256 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CONCERN WE HAD IN

02:36:03.621 --> 02:36:06.991 region:rollup2
THE IN THE FIRST AND IT WAS

02:36:05.256 --> 02:36:08.659 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRST BUSINESS PLAN WAS.

02:36:06.991 --> 02:36:10.661 region:rollup2
THE RELIANCE ON PRIVATE SECTOR

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:11.429 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AS OPPOSED TO FEDERAL

02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:13.297 region:rollup2
MONEY COMING AND THERE WAS

02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:14.832 region:rollup2
FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS PROPOSED

02:36:13.297 --> 02:36:16.234 region:rollup2
BUT AT THAT POINT IT REALLY THE

02:36:14.832 --> 02:36:17.568 region:rollup2
ONLY FEDERAL MONEY THAT WAS

02:36:16.234 --> 02:36:19.704 region:rollup2
INVESTED THAT POINT TIME WAS.

02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:21.572 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE RECOVERY ACT WITH I

02:36:19.704 --> 02:36:22.773 region:rollup2
THINK A COUPLE. MAYBE A COUPLE

02:36:21.572 --> 02:36:24.342 region:rollup2
BILLION OR I DON'T REMEMBER HOW

02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:25.810 region:rollup2
WHAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WAS BUT

02:36:24.342 --> 02:36:27.411 region:rollup2
IT WAS LIMITED AS FAR AS FEDERAL

02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:29.347 region:rollup2
MONEY THERE WAS QUESTIONED AS TO

02:36:27.411 --> 02:36:30.648 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH. PRIVATE SECTOR MONEY

02:36:29.347 --> 02:36:32.550 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INVESTED SO THERE

02:36:30.648 --> 02:36:33.150 region:rollup2
REALLY WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:35.486 region:rollup2
OF RELIANCE AT THAT POINT AND

02:36:33.150 --> 02:36:37.788 region:rollup2
TIME. ON THE BOND MONEY AND STE

02:36:35.486 --> 02:36:38.856 region:rollup2
AND STATE FUND SO WE WOULD NEED

02:36:37.788 --> 02:36:41.792 region:rollup2
TO DO.

02:36:38.856 --> 02:36:43.427 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AT THAT QUESTION AND

02:36:41.792 --> 02:36:45.630 region:rollup2
TO DO A FAIR ANALYSIS.

02:36:43.427 --> 02:36:46.998 region:rollup2
I THINK IT.

02:36:45.630 --> 02:36:48.699 region:rollup2
A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

02:36:46.998 --> 02:36:50.167 region:rollup2
HOURS WOULD NEED TO BE ADDED TO

02:36:48.699 --> 02:36:51.535 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT TO REALLY TAKE A HARD

02:36:50.167 --> 02:36:53.437 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE BUSINESS PLAN AND

02:36:51.535 --> 02:36:55.640 region:rollup2
ENGAGE WITH. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:36:53.437 --> 02:36:58.209 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY

02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.778 region:rollup2
CAME UP WITH THEIR NEW. PLAN.

02:36:58.209 --> 02:37:02.513 region:rollup2
YA PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:03.915 region:rollup2
FINANCING FOR THE SYSTEM AND

02:37:02.513 --> 02:37:05.750 region:rollup2
THEN THEIR EVENTUAL.

02:37:03.915 --> 02:37:06.317 region:rollup2
GOAL OF HAVING IT BE SELF

02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:09.287 region:rollup2
SUSTAINING. I DON'T KNOW IF

02:37:06.317 --> 02:37:11.455 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:37:09.287 --> 02:37:12.490 region:rollup2
WELL AGAIN IT'S THE COMMITTEES

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:14.158 region:rollup2
YET IT IS THE COMMITTEE'S

02:37:12.490 --> 02:37:14.992 region:rollup2
PURVIEW AND AND AND I THINK

02:37:14.158 --> 02:37:16.894 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW

02:37:14.992 --> 02:37:18.529 region:rollup2
THAT THIS SHOULD BE ONE OF THE

02:37:16.894 --> 02:37:19.797 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS THAT WE

02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:21.666 region:rollup2
ASK.

02:37:19.797 --> 02:37:24.068 region:rollup2
IN THIS PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS

02:37:21.666 --> 02:37:24.835 region:rollup2
AN OPPORTUNITY THIS FAR IN A

02:37:24.068 --> 02:37:25.970 region:rollup2
MINUTE DECADE VIRTUALLY INTO

02:37:24.835 --> 02:37:27.138 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:28.973 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE PROPOSITION IN THE

02:37:27.138 --> 02:37:31.175 region:rollup2
FUNDING STARTING TO ROLL OUT ITS

02:37:28.973 --> 02:37:33.377 region:rollup2
CETERA THAT WERE. WE LOOKING ITS

02:37:31.175 --> 02:37:35.446 region:rollup2
MASSIVE COST OVERRUNS AND DELAYS

02:37:33.377 --> 02:37:36.781 region:rollup2
AND WEARING THEEASIEST PART OF

02:37:35.446 --> 02:37:38.382 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION IN MY HUMBLE

02:37:36.781 --> 02:37:39.450 region:rollup2
OPINION NOT BEING INSTRUCTION

02:37:38.382 --> 02:37:41.986 region:rollup2
MAGNET HERE.

02:37:39.450 --> 02:37:43.354 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL

02:37:41.986 --> 02:37:44.789 region:rollup2
THE REPORTS ALL THE STUDIES

02:37:43.354 --> 02:37:46.123 region:rollup2
INDICATE THEY SHOULD BE THIS THE

02:37:44.789 --> 02:37:47.258 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THIS BEEN LAWSUITS

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:49.160 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S BEEN DELAYS ETCETERA

02:37:47.258 --> 02:37:50.594 region:rollup2
I AND THAT'S JUST. PART AND

02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:52.897 region:rollup2
PARCEL BUT.

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:54.332 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN A EVEN APPROACH THE

02:37:52.897 --> 02:37:55.533 region:rollup2
TO HATCH BEACH YET TO GET IT TO

02:37:54.332 --> 02:37:56.233 region:rollup2
LA WHICH IS WHICH IS BY THE WAY

02:37:55.533 --> 02:37:58.302 region:rollup2
A COMMITMENT OF.

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:59.670 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSITION.

02:37:58.302 --> 02:38:00.371 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS SELF SUSTAINING AND

02:37:59.670 --> 02:38:01.105 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO MEET THESE

02:38:00.371 --> 02:38:02.907 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN THESE

02:38:01.105 --> 02:38:03.741 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

02:38:02.907 --> 02:38:05.676 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT FOLKS IN MY

02:38:03.741 --> 02:38:07.244 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. THEY'LL TELL YOU

02:38:05.676 --> 02:38:08.979 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DRIVE SOUTH

02:38:07.244 --> 02:38:11.582 region:rollup2
HALF AN HOUR AND LITERALLY

02:38:08.979 --> 02:38:12.783 region:rollup2
BYPASS BURBANK AIRPORT AND THE

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:14.085 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE AIRLINES THAT ARE

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:15.252 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE THERE.

02:38:14.085 --> 02:38:16.987 region:rollup2
TO GET ON A TRAIN AND AND GO

02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:18.289 region:rollup2
NORTH WHEN THEY CAN JUST BE ON A

02:38:16.987 --> 02:38:19.190 region:rollup2
PLANE IN AN HOUR AND AND THAT'S

02:38:18.289 --> 02:38:20.758 region:rollup2
THAT'S A THAT'S A SUBJECT FOR

02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:22.460 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DEBATE BUT IT'S PART AND

02:38:20.758 --> 02:38:23.828 region:rollup2
PARCEL WITH. THE DISCUSSION THAT

02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:25.663 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING HERE BECAUSE THE

02:38:23.828 --> 02:38:27.798 region:rollup2
POLICY DECISIONS THE WEATHER

02:38:25.663 --> 02:38:30.634 region:rollup2
FUTURE. GOT CAP AND TRADE MONEY

IS IT IS IS IS ALLOCATED IS

02:38:30.634 --> 02:38:34.105 region:rollup2
INFLUENCED.

02:38:32.470 --> 02:38:35.673 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:38:34.105 --> 02:38:38.242 region:rollup2
BY ALL THE ASPECTS OF THE

02:38:35.673 --> 02:38:39.710 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC DATA AND THAT'S A BIG

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:41.912 region:rollup2
THE WITHOUT ONE OF THIS IS IF WE

02:38:39.710 --> 02:38:43.614 region:rollup2
ALL KNEW IN THIS BODY.

02:38:41.912 --> 02:38:44.515 region:rollup2
AN ART IRRESPECTIVE CHAMBERS

02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:45.182 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WAS GOING I'M JUST

02:38:44.515 --> 02:38:46.317 region:rollup2
PULLING NUMBERS OUT OF THING AIR

02:38:45.182 --> 02:38:48.052 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE FIVE

02:38:46.317 --> 02:38:49.320 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR YEAR SUBSIDY OR

02:38:48.052 --> 02:38:51.288 region:rollup2

02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:52.823 region:rollup2
OR. IT'LL MAKE MONEY THOSE WILL

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:54.492 region:rollup2

CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS NOW TO GET

02:38:54.492 --> 02:38:57.995 region:rollup2
THIS CONSTRUCTED FOR A FUTURE

02:38:55.926 --> 02:38:59.263 region:rollup2
BENEFIT. I THINK IT'S SELF

02:38:57.995 --> 02:39:01.065 region:rollup2
EVIDENT IS THAT ARE EVEN MENTION

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.966 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BUSINESSES BEING IN

SORTIR DEAR BUSINESS BUT.

02:39:11.308 --> 02:39:14.545 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POLICY

DECISION THAT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE

02:39:14.545 --> 02:39:17.848 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STATE ENTIRE STATE

OF IT NOT JUST SILICON VALLEY.

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:22.586 region:rollup2
ARE NOT JUST THE SPARTANS THE

02:39:21.652 --> 02:39:24.221 region:rollup2
BULLDOG SCENE OF MAYBE THE

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:23.633 region:rollup2
A YEAR AND SAVE TENS OF BILLIONS

02:57:21.397 --> 02:57:25.135 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS. SO WITH THAT SAID I

02:57:23.633 --> 02:57:26.269 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO

02:57:25.135 --> 02:57:28.004 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED WE HAVE

02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:28.905 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED SUCH AN EXERCISE AND I

02:57:28.004 --> 02:57:29.706 region:rollup2
THINK THERE WILL BE A TIME TO DO

02:57:28.905 --> 02:57:31.774 region:rollup2
SO.

02:57:29.706 --> 02:57:34.777 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER TIME.

02:57:31.774 --> 02:57:36.079 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT'S

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:37.514 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED ONE WERE

02:57:36.079 --> 02:57:38.948 region:rollup2
WRAPPED UP WITH ALL THE

REMAINING ACTIVITIES.

HAVE.

02:57:46.422 --> 02:57:50.560 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:52.729 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE

COMMITTEE MS RUBIO.

02:57:52.729 --> 02:57:56.399 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A COMMENT I UNDERSTAND

02:57:54.464 --> 02:57:57.600 region:rollup2
AND I CAN FEEL THE THE TENSION

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:58.801 region:rollup2
HERE BUT IT'S REALLY

02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:00.970 region:rollup2
CONDESCENDING WHEN YOU BRING A

02:57:58.801 --> 02:58:01.771 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF THIRTEEN BINDERS HAS

02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:03.106 region:rollup2
THEREFORE NOT KEEP LEVEL OF

02:58:01.771 --> 02:58:04.474 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIRTEEN

02:58:03.106 --> 02:58:06.142 region:rollup2
BINDERS IS HARD TO COME UP.

02:58:04.474 --> 02:58:08.444 region:rollup2
WHATEVER'S GOING ON.

02:58:06.142 --> 02:58:10.547 region:rollup2
BETWEEN YOU AND MR LEVIN SHOULD

02:58:08.444 --> 02:58:12.715 region:rollup2
NOT BLEED INTO OUR OUR OUR

02:58:10.547 --> 02:58:13.650 region:rollup2
POSITION HERE I HAVE NO IDEA

02:58:12.715 --> 02:58:14.784 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON I'M FROM

02:58:13.650 --> 02:58:16.319 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S

02:58:14.784 --> 02:58:18.321 region:rollup2
REALLY JUST FEELS VERY

02:58:16.319 --> 02:58:20.456 region:rollup2
DISRESPECTFUL. TO GET OF A

02:58:18.321 --> 02:58:22.125 region:rollup2
PICTURE OF A BINDER SO I CAN BE

02:58:20.456 --> 02:58:24.294 region:rollup2
JUST A SARCASTIC AND ASK YOU

02:58:22.125 --> 02:58:24.827 region:rollup2

02:58:24.294 --> 02:58:25.562 region:rollup2
GONNA SEND PICTURES TO THE

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:26.596 region:rollup2
AUDITOR.

02:58:25.562 --> 02:58:27.964 region:rollup2
I I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT

02:58:26.596 --> 02:58:30.333 region:rollup2
OUT BECAUSE AGAIN IT FEELS VERY

02:58:27.964 --> 02:58:31.935 region:rollup2
DISRESPECTFUL WHATEVER IS GOING

02:58:30.333 --> 02:58:34.037 region:rollup2
ON BETWEEN MR LEVINE AND YOUR

02:58:31.935 --> 02:58:36.005 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS NOT WHAT I'M HERE

02:58:34.037 --> 02:58:36.940 region:rollup2
TO ASSESS. SO I JUST WANTED TO

02:58:36.005 --> 02:58:39.776 region:rollup2
POINT THAT OUT.

02:58:36.940 --> 02:58:42.145 region:rollup2
I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE MERITS

02:58:39.776 --> 02:58:44.347 region:rollup2
OF THAT THE REQUEST OF THE AUDIT

02:58:42.145 --> 02:58:46.482 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE

02:58:44.347 --> 02:58:47.717 region:rollup2
WHEN THE MEMBERS ARE HAVING

02:58:46.482 --> 02:58:50.086 region:rollup2
SPATS BETWEEN THE DEPTH OF THEIR

02:58:47.717 --> 02:58:52.322 region:rollup2
THEIR AGENCIES. AND AND AGAIN I

02:58:50.086 --> 02:58:53.690 region:rollup2
WOULD CAUTION YOU FOR NEXT TIME

02:58:52.322 --> 02:58:54.791 region:rollup2
DIED WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:56.259 region:rollup2
HAPPENED SOMEBODY LIKE ME WOULD

02:58:54.791 --> 02:58:57.961 region:rollup2
BE COMPELLED JUST TO DO THE

02:58:56.259 --> 02:58:59.429 region:rollup2
AUDIT JUST BECAUSE. OF THE

02:58:57.961 --> 02:59:01.664 region:rollup2
SARCASM INVOLVED.

02:58:59.429 --> 02:59:02.732 region:rollup2
BUT MY APOLOGIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:59:01.664 --> 02:59:04.167 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT I THINK

02:59:02.732 --> 02:59:05.268 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

02:59:04.167 --> 02:59:06.569 region:rollup2
REALLY CONVEY IS THAT A

02:59:05.268 --> 02:59:07.870 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND

02:59:06.569 --> 02:59:09.939 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVENESS THAT WE HAVE

02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:11.608 region:rollup2
ALREADY PROVIDED. AND WE THOUGHT

02:59:09.939 --> 02:59:12.976 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD BE LESS KERN.

02:59:11.608 --> 02:59:13.910 region:rollup2
IN YOUR FACE IF YOU WILL THEN

02:59:12.976 --> 02:59:15.878 region:rollup2
BRINGING UP THE BINDERS

02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:17.213 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES WHICH YOU KNOW IS

02:59:15.878 --> 02:59:18.381 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD TAKE UP AS A HUGE

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:20.750 region:rollup2
MASS SPACE THAT WOULD BE A.

02:59:18.381 --> 02:59:23.086 region:rollup2
SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE ON ITSELF

02:59:20.750 --> 02:59:24.988 region:rollup2
AYE BUT POINT TAKEN.

02:59:23.086 --> 02:59:28.124 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT CENTER BAKER THENCE OF

02:59:24.988 --> 02:59:29.759 region:rollup2
BURRIS.

02:59:28.124 --> 02:59:30.727 region:rollup2
AND MS BAKER THEN CENTER BELL.

02:59:29.759 --> 02:59:32.495 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:59:30.727 --> 02:59:33.663 region:rollup2
I.

02:59:32.495 --> 02:59:34.931 region:rollup2
SUPPORT YOUR ORIGINAL AUDIT

02:59:33.663 --> 02:59:36.532 region:rollup2
MISTER LEVINE I THOUGHT IT WAS

02:59:34.931 --> 02:59:38.101 region:rollup2
VERY WELL WRITTEN SEVERAL MONTHS

02:59:36.532 --> 02:59:39.302 region:rollup2
AGO I'M ONLY SORRY THAT IT

02:59:38.101 --> 02:59:40.203 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAPPEN EARLIER BECAUSE WE

02:59:39.302 --> 02:59:41.504 region:rollup2
DO HAVE THE BALLOT MEASURE

02:59:40.203 --> 02:59:42.305 region:rollup2
COMING FORWARDBEFORE BAY AREA

02:59:41.504 --> 02:59:44.440 region:rollup2
VOTERS WHERE THIS WOULD BE

02:59:42.305 --> 02:59:46.175 region:rollup2
HELPFUL INFORMATION HOW.

02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:47.910 region:rollup2
AND I DISAGREE THAT IT'S NOT

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:48.911 region:rollup2
NECESSARY I UNDERSTAND THERE

02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:50.613 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN STUDIES AYE AYE

02:59:48.911 --> 02:59:52.482 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING EAST BAY DISTRICT I

02:59:50.613 --> 02:59:53.983 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUSANDS OF NOT TENS OF

02:59:52.482 --> 02:59:55.718 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF CONSTITUENTS PAIN

02:59:53.983 --> 02:59:57.587 region:rollup2
THOSE TOLLS EVERYDAY. GOING

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:59.489 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

02:59:57.587 --> 03:00:00.890 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WHAT WHAT HAS NOT

02:59:59.489 --> 03:00:03.026 region:rollup2
HAPPENED ISN'T JUST THAT WE'VE

03:00:00.890 --> 03:00:04.460 region:rollup2
LEARNED OUR LESSON.

03:00:03.026 --> 03:00:05.795 region:rollup2
ITEM NUMBER FOUR IN THE REQUEST

03:00:04.460 --> 03:00:07.530 region:rollup2
WHICH IS HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR

03:00:05.795 --> 03:00:09.699 region:rollup2
PRACTICES.

03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:11.734 region:rollup2
THAT IS PROBABLY THE SINGLE BEST

03:00:09.699 --> 03:00:14.170 region:rollup2
PART IN MY OPINION OF THIS AUDIT

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:16.306 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN.

03:00:14.170 --> 03:00:18.441 region:rollup2
AND AND WHAT YOU DON'T WANT. IS

03:00:16.306 --> 03:00:20.376 region:rollup2
BINDERS AND STACKS OF REPORTS

03:00:18.441 --> 03:00:21.878 region:rollup2
INTERNAL.

03:00:20.376 --> 03:00:22.679 region:rollup2
I REVIEW THAT LISTS ALL THE

03:00:21.878 --> 03:00:24.547 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

03:00:22.679 --> 03:00:27.350 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY STACKED UP AND NOT

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:29.852 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY APPLIED IN PRACTICE.

03:00:27.350 --> 03:00:31.754 region:rollup2
SO. I WAS HOPING THAT THERE

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:32.789 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A FULL EMBRACE OF THIS

03:00:31.754 --> 03:00:35.024 region:rollup2
AUDIT FOR THAT REASON ALONE

03:00:32.789 --> 03:00:36.125 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

03:00:35.024 --> 03:00:39.262 region:rollup2
YEP FOLKS WHEN THEY SEE SUCH A

03:00:36.125 --> 03:00:40.797 region:rollup2
PROJECT WITH SUCH COST OVERRUNS.

03:00:39.262 --> 03:00:42.131 region:rollup2
BEYOND WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY

03:00:40.797 --> 03:00:43.866 region:rollup2
EXPECT IN A. IN A PUBLIC WORKS

03:00:42.131 --> 03:00:45.268 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

03:00:43.866 --> 03:00:45.902 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR ANY

03:00:45.268 --> 03:00:47.336 region:rollup2
DO ALL THE STUDIES TO FIND OUT

03:00:45.902 --> 03:00:48.471 region:rollup2
WHAT WENT WRONG THEY'RE GONNA

03:00:47.336 --> 03:00:49.605 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE

03:00:48.471 --> 03:00:51.341 region:rollup2
THEIR PRACTICES.

03:00:49.605 --> 03:00:52.942 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE ONLY AUDIT I'VE SEEN

03:00:51.341 --> 03:00:55.078 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:57.180 region:rollup2
WILL REALLY LOOK AT HAVE YOU

03:00:55.078 --> 03:00:58.648 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DONE IT NUMBER ONE.

03:00:57.180 --> 03:01:01.217 region:rollup2
SO IT IS NEEDED AND I I HOPE

03:00:58.648 --> 03:01:02.018 region:rollup2
THERE WILL BE A FULL EMBRACE.

03:01:01.217 --> 03:01:02.585 region:rollup2
AND IT GETS ME NUMBER TWO

03:01:02.018 --> 03:01:04.654 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S TOO LITTLE

03:01:02.585 --> 03:01:05.822 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE

03:01:04.654 --> 03:01:07.890 region:rollup2
THAT A AND M. T. C. ARE

03:01:05.822 --> 03:01:09.826 region:rollup2
BASICALLY ONE IN THE SAME.

03:01:07.890 --> 03:01:11.661 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ONLY THREE VOICES

03:01:09.826 --> 03:01:13.763 region:rollup2
AND IN THEM.

03:01:11.661 --> 03:01:15.531 region:rollup2
AND I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE

03:01:13.763 --> 03:01:18.067 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF NONPARTISAN

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:20.303 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT COMPLETELY OUTSIDE

03:01:18.067 --> 03:01:21.804 region:rollup2
AUDIT TO LOOK AT. NOT ONLY THE

03:01:20.303 --> 03:01:23.339 region:rollup2
OTHER AT ELEMENTS OF THE OUT OF

03:01:21.804 --> 03:01:25.508 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR NUMBER FOUR.

03:01:23.339 --> 03:01:27.710 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK YOU MISTER LEVINE

03:01:25.508 --> 03:01:28.745 region:rollup2
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I I

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:29.979 region:rollup2
LIKE TO ASK THE AUDITOR IT'S

03:01:28.745 --> 03:01:31.247 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE I DON'T KNOW THAT

03:01:29.979 --> 03:01:34.016 region:rollup2
THIS WILL BE.

03:01:31.247 --> 03:01:36.285 region:rollup2
OUT AND AVAILABLE TO US IN TIME

03:01:34.016 --> 03:01:38.221 region:rollup2
FOR THE BAY AREA TO DECIDE IF

03:01:36.285 --> 03:01:40.123 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA RAISE ITS TOLLS.

03:01:38.221 --> 03:01:41.491 region:rollup2
AND END TO SEE THAT YOU'VE

03:01:40.123 --> 03:01:42.859 region:rollup2
EARNED THE AT THESE ENTITIES OF

03:01:41.491 --> 03:01:44.927 region:rollup2
EARNS THAT ADDITIONAL MONEY IN

03:01:42.859 --> 03:01:47.063 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THEIR PRACTICES.

03:01:44.927 --> 03:01:48.564 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

03:01:47.063 --> 03:01:49.999 region:rollup2
START WITH ONE PARTICULAR PART

03:01:48.564 --> 03:01:52.168 region:rollup2
OF THE AUDIT AND REALLY DIVE

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:53.436 region:rollup2
INTO THAT FIRST IS THAT.

03:01:52.168 --> 03:01:54.737 region:rollup2
AT IS THAT PRUDENT WITH THAT

03:01:53.436 --> 03:01:55.805 region:rollup2
MESS UP THE ABILITY FOR YOU TO

03:01:54.737 --> 03:01:56.973 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EFFECTIVE OUTCOME

03:01:55.805 --> 03:01:58.708 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT IS

03:01:56.973 --> 03:02:00.510 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE INFORMATION BUT I'M.

03:01:58.708 --> 03:02:01.577 region:rollup2
AND I AM NOT LOOKING NEITHER WAS

03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:02.912 region:rollup2
I BEFORE TO AMEND THE AUDIT I'M

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:04.180 region:rollup2
JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE THE

03:02:02.912 --> 03:02:06.649 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO.

03:02:04.180 --> 03:02:09.218 region:rollup2
GET TO A QUESTION EARLIER.

03:02:06.649 --> 03:02:10.453 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE THAT TO US.

03:02:09.218 --> 03:02:12.755 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY CAN'T DO THAT.

03:02:10.453 --> 03:02:14.157 region:rollup2
WHAT WEEK WE COULD DO ON THIS

03:02:12.755 --> 03:02:15.625 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROJECT AND AS I

03:02:14.157 --> 03:02:17.126 region:rollup2
NOTED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS

03:02:15.625 --> 03:02:18.261 region:rollup2
THERE THERE WEREN'T ANY AUDITS

03:02:17.126 --> 03:02:20.463 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE WAS A SPECIFIC

03:02:18.261 --> 03:02:21.230 region:rollup2
DEADLINE REQUESTED BY? THE

03:02:20.463 --> 03:02:23.533 region:rollup2
MEMBER.

03:02:21.230 --> 03:02:24.634 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE WE COULD TAKE TWO

03:02:23.533 --> 03:02:26.302 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TO THIS PARTICULAR

03:02:24.634 --> 03:02:28.037 region:rollup2
PROJECT IF IT'S THE DESIRE THE

03:02:26.302 --> 03:02:29.772 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO HAVE THIS BE A.

03:02:28.037 --> 03:02:30.606 region:rollup2
PRIORITY I HAVE TEAMS AS I

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:32.408 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT ALREADY HIT THE

03:02:30.606 --> 03:02:33.543 region:rollup2
GROUND RUNNING SO. IF THE

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.844 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE CHOOSES TO APPROVE

03:02:33.543 --> 03:02:36.712 region:rollup2
THIS AUDIT WE WERE ASSIGNED

03:02:34.844 --> 03:02:38.748 region:rollup2
STAFF TO IMMEDIATELY. GET THE

03:02:36.712 --> 03:02:40.383 region:rollup2
AUDIT STARTED WE COULD AGAIN

03:02:38.748 --> 03:02:41.384 region:rollup2
TAKE TWO APPROACHES.

03:02:40.383 --> 03:02:42.585 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY THROW ADDITIONAL

03:02:41.384 --> 03:02:44.020 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AT IT TO TRY TO GET IT

03:02:42.585 --> 03:02:45.288 region:rollup2
DONE.

03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:46.622 region:rollup2
BEFORE I THINK THE REGIONAL

03:02:45.288 --> 03:02:48.424 region:rollup2
MEASURES ON THE BALLOT FOR EARLY

03:02:46.622 --> 03:02:50.426 region:rollup2
JUNE SO THIS WOULD BE A VERY

03:02:48.424 --> 03:02:51.994 region:rollup2
TIGHT TIMEFRAME. THE OTHER THING

03:02:50.426 --> 03:02:53.329 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD DO IS IF THERE'S A

03:02:51.994 --> 03:02:55.965 region:rollup2
DESIRE BY THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:57.834 region:rollup2
ANSWERS TO CERTAIN OBJECTIVES.

03:02:55.965 --> 03:02:59.168 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AS

03:02:57.834 --> 03:03:00.970 region:rollup2
WE'VE ISSUED TWO REPORTS THERE'S

03:02:59.168 --> 03:03:02.672 region:rollup2
A POINT ONE THAT ADDRESSES THESE

03:03:00.970 --> 03:03:04.140 region:rollup2
TWO OBJECTIVES AND HERE'S A

03:03:02.672 --> 03:03:05.775 region:rollup2
POINT TO THAT ADDRESSES THE

03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:08.010 region:rollup2
REMAINDER OF?

03:03:05.775 --> 03:03:09.078 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT MR LEVINE AND

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.980 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE COMMITTEE IF THE

03:03:09.078 --> 03:03:12.682 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE APPROVES THE THE AUDIT

03:03:10.980 --> 03:03:14.383 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THAT'S AN OPTION THAT

03:03:12.682 --> 03:03:17.820 region:rollup2
NAM WE COULD CONSIDER AS WELL.

03:03:14.383 --> 03:03:19.789 region:rollup2
AND AND AND I WOULD WELCOME AT

03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:20.356 region:rollup2
IT WITH RESPECT TO OUR.

03:03:19.789 --> 03:03:21.224 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES HAVE AUTHORED THE

03:03:20.356 --> 03:03:22.625 region:rollup2
AUDIT

03:03:21.224 --> 03:03:24.093 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT

03:03:22.625 --> 03:03:25.495 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I DO THINK THE

03:03:24.093 --> 03:03:26.529 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE OF THIS IS SO

03:03:25.495 --> 03:03:28.331 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR THE DECISION THAT

03:03:26.529 --> 03:03:29.999 region:rollup2
WILL BE MADE. PROBABLY JUNE

03:03:28.331 --> 03:03:31.100 region:rollup2
MAYBE NOVEMBER.

03:03:29.999 --> 03:03:33.336 region:rollup2
AND.

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:35.338 region:rollup2
AND A IN THE INTEREST OF FULL

03:03:33.336 --> 03:03:36.806 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND OWNING THAT

03:03:35.338 --> 03:03:39.575 region:rollup2
BOTH THAT MEASURE AND.%

03:03:36.806 --> 03:03:41.010 region:rollup2
BAY BRIDGE OPERATIONS HAVING

03:03:39.575 --> 03:03:42.445 region:rollup2
THIS OUT THERE IF I MAY ASK

03:03:41.010 --> 03:03:43.079 region:rollup2
MISTER LEVINE DO YOU HAVE ANY

03:03:42.445 --> 03:03:45.815 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO

03:03:43.079 --> 03:03:47.483 region:rollup2
OPTIONS.

03:03:45.815 --> 03:03:48.050 region:rollup2
WHICH I MEAN TO SPRING ON YOU I

03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:48.885 region:rollup2
DIDN'T REALIZE THEY WERE TO

03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:49.552 region:rollup2
OPTION THAT WE HAD IT'S AN

03:03:48.885 --> 03:03:50.786 region:rollup2
INTERESTING QUESTION I I

03:03:49.552 --> 03:03:51.954 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HAD HOPED WHEN I

03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:51.954 region:rollup2
PRESENTED THE AUDIT LAST YEAR

03:03:52.255 --> 03:03:55.057 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING

03:03:55.124 --> 03:03:57.293 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE COMPLETED.

03:03:56.559 --> 03:03:58.728 region:rollup2
.

03:03:57.293 --> 03:04:01.864 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BY NOW.

03:03:58.728 --> 03:04:03.232 region:rollup2
I THAT ACTUALLY NTC BATTER

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:05.635 region:rollup2
CALTRANS COULD ACTUALLY

03:04:03.232 --> 03:04:06.669 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE GOOD NEWS OR IF

03:04:05.635 --> 03:04:08.337 region:rollup2
THERE WAS WORK TO DO.

03:04:06.669 --> 03:04:09.839 region:rollup2
REMEDIATION

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:10.706 region:rollup2
TO BURN.

03:04:09.839 --> 03:04:12.475 region:rollup2
THE TRUST IN SUPPORT OF THE

03:04:10.706 --> 03:04:14.911 region:rollup2
PUBLIC

03:04:12.475 --> 03:04:17.079 region:rollup2
JUST IN GENERAL NOT SPECIFIC TO

03:04:14.911 --> 03:04:18.814 region:rollup2
ON A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN AROUND

03:04:17.079 --> 03:04:20.716 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF ARM THREE WHICH WE

03:04:18.814 --> 03:04:22.051 region:rollup2
DID NOT KNOW. A DATE AND THAT WE

03:04:20.716 --> 03:04:23.085 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'VE

03:04:22.051 --> 03:04:24.320 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SET A DATE YET WHAT HAS

03:04:23.085 --> 03:04:26.055 region:rollup2
BEEN SET HAVE.

03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:27.757 region:rollup2
SO ON I KNEW THAT THAT WAS WHAT

03:04:26.055 --> 03:04:28.891 region:rollup2
THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING. BUT IT

03:04:27.757 --> 03:04:29.825 region:rollup2
WAS MY HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:31.360 region:rollup2
ABLE TO YOU KNOW EVEN IF THEY

03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:32.728 region:rollup2
GOT A BAD.

03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:35.064 region:rollup2
SCORE RIGHT OUT OF YOU KNOW ON

03:04:32.728 --> 03:04:36.566 region:rollup2
THIS TEST SO TO SPEAK

03:04:35.064 --> 03:04:37.733 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A LOOK YOU KNOW

03:04:36.566 --> 03:04:38.167 region:rollup2
WE'RE GLAD WE GOT THAT SORTED DO

03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:39.302 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

03:04:38.167 --> 03:04:40.436 region:rollup2
.

03:04:39.302 --> 03:04:40.703 region:rollup2
SO BY THE TIMING OF THIS IS

03:04:40.436 --> 03:04:42.838 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT

03:04:40.703 --> 03:04:44.006 region:rollup2
I THINK.

03:04:42.838 --> 03:04:46.876 region:rollup2
THE THING THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

03:04:44.006 --> 03:04:47.343 region:rollup2
TO ME AND I THINK TO THE MEMBERS

03:04:46.876 --> 03:04:48.711 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE AUDIT IS.

03:04:47.343 --> 03:04:49.979 region:rollup2
.

03:04:48.711 --> 03:04:51.013 region:rollup2
EXHAUSTIVE AND AND INEFFICIENT

03:04:49.979 --> 03:04:53.783 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME.

03:04:51.013 --> 03:04:56.018 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S USABLE AND USEFUL

03:04:53.783 --> 03:04:59.121 region:rollup2
BY THE AGENCIES AROUND AS WELL

03:04:56.018 --> 03:05:00.189 region:rollup2
AS SIDE TO THIS BODY.

03:04:59.121 --> 03:05:02.091 region:rollup2
ON TO PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT

03:05:00.189 --> 03:05:05.294 region:rollup2
THAT'S NECESSARY AND I DON'T

03:05:02.091 --> 03:05:06.862 region:rollup2
WANT TO SIT HERE AND AND.

03:05:05.294 --> 03:05:08.431 region:rollup2
DICTATE HOW THE AUDITOR USES HER

03:05:06.862 --> 03:05:10.232 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND I WOULD TRUST THE

03:05:08.431 --> 03:05:11.767 region:rollup2
AUDITOR TO USE OUR RESOURCES IN

03:05:10.232 --> 03:05:13.970 region:rollup2
A WAY THAT HELPS HER UP PURSUE

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:15.204 region:rollup2
THAT MISSION.

03:05:13.970 --> 03:05:16.772 region:rollup2
OF I MEAN I I THINK YOU AND I

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:17.707 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT I HEARD.

03:05:16.772 --> 03:05:19.508 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR IN A

03:05:17.707 --> 03:05:20.476 region:rollup2
FEW HOURS AGO WAS WE'VE WE HAVE

03:05:19.508 --> 03:05:22.111 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WE HAVE TIME WERE

03:05:20.476 --> 03:05:23.646 region:rollup2
READY.

03:05:22.111 --> 03:05:25.915 region:rollup2
AND WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:05:23.646 --> 03:05:27.016 region:rollup2
OF A TIME SENSITIVITY. I'M ALSO

03:05:25.915 --> 03:05:28.784 region:rollup2
HEARING THAT YOU'VE I THINK IT

03:05:27.016 --> 03:05:29.785 region:rollup2
ORIGIN AMOUNT THAT YOU CAN GET

03:05:28.784 --> 03:05:31.854 region:rollup2
THIS WORK DONE.

03:05:29.785 --> 03:05:33.055 region:rollup2
EVEN UNDER AN EXPEDITED I I

03:05:31.854 --> 03:05:34.790 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:35.624 region:rollup2
BIFURCATING THERE ARE DOING

03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:36.792 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PARTS OF DIFFERENT

03:05:35.624 --> 03:05:38.294 region:rollup2
TIMES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT NEEDS

03:05:36.792 --> 03:05:39.462 region:rollup2
AN ADDITIONAL MOTION OR IF THIS

03:05:38.294 --> 03:05:41.364 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS A

03:05:39.462 --> 03:05:43.366 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IF WE AGREE. COULD

03:05:41.364 --> 03:05:44.300 region:rollup2
COULD DIRECT BUT I WOULD HOPE

03:05:43.366 --> 03:05:46.168 region:rollup2
THAT THE RESULTS

03:05:44.300 --> 03:05:48.404 region:rollup2
TO THE OUT IT COULD BE AVAILABLE

03:05:46.168 --> 03:05:49.071 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS

03:05:48.404 --> 03:05:50.339 region:rollup2
ON THE TIME FRAME YOU'VE

03:05:49.071 --> 03:05:52.208 region:rollup2
INDICATED WITH THE RESOURCES

03:05:50.339 --> 03:05:53.876 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE SAID YOU MAY BE ABLE

03:05:52.208 --> 03:05:55.945 region:rollup2
TO DEDICATE TO IT. AND THAT'S

03:05:53.876 --> 03:05:56.879 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD MOVE IT IF IT HAS

03:05:55.945 --> 03:05:58.114 region:rollup2
NEVER BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED

03:05:56.879 --> 03:06:01.183 region:rollup2
NIGHT. SOUNDS LIKE IT MAY BE

03:05:58.114 --> 03:06:04.720 region:rollup2
AGREEABLE.

03:06:01.183 --> 03:06:06.389 region:rollup2
I YEAH.

03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.956 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK IT.

03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:07.823 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS A

03:06:06.956 --> 03:06:09.158 region:rollup2
MOTION I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU

03:06:07.823 --> 03:06:10.659 region:rollup2

YOU CAN DO THAT.

03:06:10.659 --> 03:06:14.130 region:rollup2
IS TO PUT YOUR RESOURCES INTO

03:06:12.628 --> 03:06:15.698 region:rollup2
IT AND I WOULD URGE US TO DO

03:06:14.130 --> 03:06:16.332 region:rollup2
THAT IF IT TAKES ACTION FROM

03:06:15.698 --> 03:06:19.835 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE I WOULD URGE THAT

03:06:16.332 --> 03:06:21.270 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

03:06:19.835 --> 03:06:22.905 region:rollup2
WELL AS I INDICATED MS BAKER WE

03:06:21.270 --> 03:06:24.407 region:rollup2

ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT THEN

03:06:48.764 --> 03:06:51.801 region:rollup2

BUT WE CAN DO IT.

03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:22.531 region:rollup2
