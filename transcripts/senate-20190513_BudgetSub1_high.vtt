FINANCIAL AID REFORM I DO WANT

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:32.558
TO NOTE -- ONE ITEM THAT I COULD

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.459
AT LEAST BE PARTIALLY

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:34.794
RESPONSIBLE SOME CONCERNS OF

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.529
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE HAD RAISED.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.497
WHICH I THE CHILD SAVINGS

ACCOUNTS WHEN -- I WAS HERE A

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.534
WEEK OR TWO AGO -- THAT MEMBERS

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.702
OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAD

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.504
EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN THAT THE

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.438
EXISTING PROGRAM THAT WERE

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.774
RUNNING -- IT DIDN'T INCLUDE

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.375
PROGRAMS IN SOME REGIONS OF THE

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:50.977
STATE -- AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.779
DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.580
LANGUAGE IN THE EVERY KID COUNTS

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.314
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CURRENT

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:55.915
PROGRAM.

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.383
DID NOT ALLOW FOR THE FUNDS TO

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.085
BE USED FOR START UP FOR SORT OF

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.554
JUMP START FUNDS AND THIS

00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.855
PROPOSAL IN THE REVISED.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.224
INCLUDE A SPECIFIC SET ASIDE

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:05.792
ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF THE

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:07.794
FUNDS PARTY'S DESIGNATED FOR NEW

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.262
PROGRAMS TO SORT OF HELP THEM

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.164
GET OFF THE GROUND SO -- WITH

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.898
ANY LUCK IF IT WERE TO BE

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.833
APPROVED WE WOULD -- WANT TO

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.268
WORK WITH YOUR OFFICES AND WITH

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.036
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LEADING

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.337
CALIFORNIA CITIES AND SO FORTH

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.205
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:20.640
COVERING MORE REASONS OF THE

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.708
STATE INCLUDING THOSE THAT --

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.376
THAT MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.911
HAD MENTIONED AT THE LAST

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:26.479
HEARING ON THIS.

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.980
THANK YOU YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.550
REGARDING THE LA OWES.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.685
ANALYSIS OF I GUESS IT WAS THE

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:38.191
TEACHERS SERVICE CREDIT

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:38.658
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:39.392
IN THE COMMENTED PROSPECTIVE

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:39.992
APPLICANTS WOULD NEED TO KNOW

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:41.060
ABOUT THE PROGRAM BEFORE THEY

00:07:41.127 --> 00:07:41.894
DECIDE WHICH SUBJECT HERE ISN'T

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:42.495
SCHOOLS TO TEACH AND AND THE

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:44.063
FOLLOWING COMMENTS ABOUT HOW

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.065
THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.333
WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.436
CONCERN -- AND WE WOULD WANT --

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.537
TO PROBABLY WORK WITH THE

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:52.972
ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.174
THERE IS SOME ALLOWANCE IN THE

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:57.009
LANGUAGE -- IF THERE'S A DESIRE

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.344
TO DO SO FROM -- FROM THE

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.046
LEGISLATURE TO DO SOME OUTREACH

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.615
ON THE FRONT END -- SO WE'D BE

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.383
HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:04.884
LEGISLATURE ON THAT THE

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.919
ADMINISTRATION TO SEE IF -- TO

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:07.887
SEE IF THAT CONCERN CAN BE

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.089
ADDRESSED FINANCE WAS THAT JUST

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:11.624
SIMPLY AN UNINTENDED.

00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:13.626
DEVELOPMENT SO I I THINK THE

00:08:13.693 --> 00:08:15.061
KIND OF ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR OF

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.829
THE PROPOSALS THAT WE DO REQUIRE

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.531
THIS YOU NEED COMMISSION TO WORK

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:19.165
WITH THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER

00:08:19.232 --> 00:08:20.633
CREDENTIALING. TO KIND OF

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:21.934
IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE BEST

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.903
OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH TEACHERS

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.838
TO INFORM THEIR DECISION FROM

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:26.939
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.975
THIS PROPOSAL ISN'T NECESSARILY

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.877
ABOUT TACKLING THE LARGE TEACHER

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.278
SHORTAGE THAT EXIST IN THE STATE.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:36.816
BUT RATHER IT'S A ONE TO PURSUE

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:38.918
TEACHING THAT'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:40.286
IN SCHOOL SITES THAT HAVE HIGH

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.321
NUMBERS OF PROVISIONAL OR

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:46.259
CONDITIONAL WAIVERS.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:46.926
SO IN OTHER WORDS ARE YOU SAYING

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.361
THIS.

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:48.928
THE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.763
WHERE THEY ARE AND AND AND

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.397
THEY'RE GONNA QUALIFY WHERE THEY

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.765
ARE.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:54.033
A NOT NECESSARILY I THINK I

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.234
THINK THE POINT IS OF THE

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:56.769
PROPOSALS THAT THE TWO

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.337
COMMISSIONS WORKING TOGETHER

00:08:58.404 --> 00:08:59.138
WILL DEVELOP.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:01.274
A LIST OF WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.109
HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF THESE

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:05.411
PROVISIONAL WAIVERS AND PERMITS.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:06.979
AND HEN BASED ON THAT THEY'LL

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.915
PRIORITIZE AWARDING THE GRANTS

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.383
TO STUDENTS WERE TEACHING IN

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.152
HIGH PRIORITY AREAS SUCH AS STEM

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.755
FIELDS OUT THOSE SCHOOL SITES.

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:19.025
I SEE.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.626
AND IF I MAY ADD TO THAT DRUG

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.694
JUST BEFORE THIS HEARING AID

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.029
NOTIFIED YOUR STAFF THAT WE'RE

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:23.763
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:25.231
LANGUAGE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:26.632
AND WILL ATTEMPT TO GET THAT

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.301
YOUR STAFF AS QUICKLY IN ITS

00:09:28.367 --> 00:09:30.870
EXPOSITION EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:31.437
CAN [inaudible]

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:35.007
PERFECT.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.409
ANYTHING FURTHER ON THIS

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.744
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:39.345
COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS THEIR

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.213
LEVEL.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.581
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.383
MORNING EVERYONE HAPPY MONDAY.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.954
I HAVE A QUESTION -- I BELIEVE

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.822
IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PROPOSAL TO

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.224
PROVIDE FUNDS FOR RAPID --

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.592
RESPONSE FOR HOMELESS AND THE

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.461
HOUSING NEEDS OF IN OF OUR IN

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:56.996
SECURE STUDENTS.

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:59.031
BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT IT

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.433
DOESN'T GO TO OUR MOST

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.034
VULNERABLE POPULATION AND WE'RE

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.070
NOT HELPING STUDENTS THAT NEED

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:04.670
IT THE MOST.

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.505
SOME WONDERING AND I'M NOT SURE

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.173
WHO ARE ONCE ANSWER THE QUESTION

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:10.242
CAN -- WHAT THE RATIONALE IS FOR

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.411
EXCLUDING LOW INCOME COMMUNITY

00:10:12.478 --> 00:10:13.379
COLLEGE STUDENTS?

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:15.281
OR ACTUALLY ONCE THAT ARE FACING

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:19.652
THE HIGHEST NON TUITION COSTS.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:22.054
AND SO THE THE PROPOSAL IS SIDE.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:23.089
THREE POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:24.957
FUND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.659
SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TO THE

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.260
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY --

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:30.730
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE NOT

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:32.631
INCLUDED WITHIN THAT PROPOSAL --

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:33.933
BASED UPON THE AVAILABLE

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.235
RESOURCES WITHIN PROPOSITION

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:36.902
NINETY EIGHT SO I DON'T THINK IT

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:37.937
WAS NECESSARILY.

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:39.538
A JUDGMENT CALL AS TO THE

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:41.307
IMPORTANCE OF OF RAPID RE

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.242
HOUSING -- FOR VULNERABLE

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.011
POPULATION SO MUCH AS IT WAS THE

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.079
AVAILABLE RESOURCES WITHIN THE

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:47.380
GUARANTEE.

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:48.547
SO IT.

00:10:48.614 --> 00:10:50.683
IS THERE MORE MONEY IMPROPER

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.718
NINETY EIGHT THAT I DIDN'T SEE

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:54.920
THAT'S GOING TO HELP THEM.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.455
NO I THINK WHAT WHAT WERE

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.024
INSINUATING IT'S THAT THE

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.792
PROPOSITION NINETY PACKAGE

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:00.659
GLOBALLY.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.728
IT WAS VERY TIGHT THIS YEAR AND

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.163
DIDN'T ENABLE US.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.464
TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:06.565
AT THIS TIME.

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.501
OKAY -- EVEN THOUGH THERE PUBLIC

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.102
THE ONES THAT NEED IT THE MOST.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.070
YEAH I WOULD CERTAINLY

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:12.405
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A NEED

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.673
IN THE SYSTEM OKAY SO IS THERE

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.574
ANY OTHER.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.876
ANOTHER APPROACH THAT WE CAN

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:18.677
TAKE HOW DO WE HELP THESE

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:19.578
STUDENTS.

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.080
YOU KNOW I MEAN I MEAN IF I WAS

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:22.281
A STUDENT I WAS JUST LOOK AT MY

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.749
CELL THEY'RE GIVING ME THE UC'S

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.151
AGREEMENT THIS ISSUES BUT THEY

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:27.019
JUST CLEARLY DON'T CARE ABOUT ME

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:29.655
AS A COMMUNICATOR STUDENT.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:31.323
SO I THINK WE'LL CRTAINLY WORK

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.525
WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:33.659
SEE IF THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES I

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.428
KNOW IN THE PAST THAT THERE HAVE

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.863
BEEN ALTERNATIVES -- THAT HAVE

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.765
BEEN LEGISLATIVELY CONSIDERED --

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.234
SUCH AS EMERGENCY GRANTS --

00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:44.737
THINGS OF THAT NATURE OF WE'VE

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.405
ALSO HEARD IN THAT BILL LAST I

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:47.840
BELIEVE IT WAS LAST SESSION THAT

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:49.208
THERE WAS A BILL TO THAT.

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:50.476
AFFECT THE WOULD ALSO SAY THAT A

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.944
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISN'T

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.579
PRECLUDED FROM USING SOME OF ITS

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.714
FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE --

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.550
THERE'S A A A CHANCELLOR'S

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:00.986
OFFICE LEGAL INTERPRETATION THEN.

00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:02.455
AT THIS TIME INDICATES THAT THEY

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:02.755
CAN'T DO SO.

00:12:02.822 --> 00:12:04.390
OKAY.

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:05.558
ALRIGHT BUT HOPE WE CANNOT

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:06.592
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FOR THE

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.095
STUDENTS -- AND I ALSO WANT TO

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.030
EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE ONE

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.998
TIME FIVE MILLION BECAUSE THE

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:13.966
TWO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.435
MOST LIKELY IMPACTED BY THAT.

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:18.237
IS THE INLAND EMPIRE -- WHICH IS

00:12:18.304 --> 00:12:19.839
MY DISTRICT AND CENTER RAS

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.108
DISTRICT AND THEN ALSO THE THE

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.844
CENTRAL VALLEY SO IF IF WE'RE IT

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.846
IT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MAY NOT

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:27.713
SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.481
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE A

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:30.082
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.250
STUDENTS THAT WE REPRESENT SO I

00:12:31.317 --> 00:12:32.852
WOULD WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.973
PROPOSALS ON THAT THE THIRD

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.774
PROPOSAL FOR RAPID RE HOUSING IS

00:19:02.841 --> 00:19:04.676
COMPARABLE TO A PROPOSAL FOR CS

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.445
USE WITHOUT IT BE HELPFUL FOR

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.779
YOU FOR THE CSU PORTION JUST.

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:10.015
MENTION THAT ONE TIME TO TO SAY

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:11.483
THE COMMITTEE SOMETIME THERE.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.051
ON THE FIRST PROPOSAL FOR A YOU

00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:14.853
SEE OUR P..

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.255
WE THINK THIS RAISES A FEW

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.089
ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.991
CONSIDERATION.

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:20.325
THE FIRST ISSUE IS A IS A RATHER

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.160
BROAD ISSUE AND IT'S ISSUE THAT

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:23.328
YOU FACE EACH YEAR AS OUR DECIDE

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:24.763
DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE ONE

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.032
TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE

00:19:27.099 --> 00:19:28.767
STATE'S VARIOUS LIABILITIES.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:29.535
OTHER STATE FUNDS THREE

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:30.903
DIFFERENT PENSION SYSTEMS

00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:32.871
CALPERS CAL STIRS AND USE YOUR

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.873
P. AND THERE'S A BROAD QUESTION

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.642
YOUR FACE BUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:37.175
FUNDING AMONG THOSE THREE

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:37.943
SYSTEMS.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.611
WHAT APPROACH AVAILABLE TO THE

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.113
LEGISLATURE COULD BE TO

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:42.247
PRIORITIZE FUNDING?

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:44.683
A TO CALPERS AND CAL STIRS FIRST.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.385
THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:47.819
APPROACH WOULD BE THAT THE STATE

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.555
DIRECTLY ADOPTION PENSION

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.590
BENEFITS IN THE FUNDING POLICIES

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:52.658
FOR THE SYSTEMS.

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.793
I THOUGHT EITHER A CLEAR ROLE IN

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.028
TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.663
REMAINING UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:19:59.231
RESULTING FROM UNDER FUNDING THE

00:19:59.298 --> 00:20:01.867
PENSION SYSTEM BY CONTRAST I

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.036
EASY THE UC REGENTS ADOPT THE

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:05.270
PENSION BENEFITS.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.939
I'M IN THE FUNDING POLICY FOR

00:20:07.005 --> 00:20:07.973
YOU SEE OUR P. NO THAT'S SAID

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.309
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT STILL WANT.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.677
TO ADDRESS SOME COST PRESSURES

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:12.911
THAT YOU SEE YOU MIGHT WANT TO

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:13.979
PROVIDE SOME ONE TIME FUNDING TO

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.882
ADDRESS THAT UNFUNDED PENSION

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:17.783
LIABILITY.

00:20:17.849 --> 00:20:18.617
OUR SECOND CONSIDERATION IS THAT

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:19.451
IF YOU IF THAT WAS THE GOAL OF

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.253
THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.020
THAT YOU GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF

00:20:22.087 --> 00:20:24.122
THIS POTENTIAL SAVINGS RESULTING

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.357
FROM THIS APPROPRIATION.

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:26.658
OF THE LEGISLATURE AS OF YET

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:27.859
HASN'T RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE OF

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.561
THE ASSOCIATED SAVINGS OF

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:31.563
PROVIDING THE ONE TIME FUNDING.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.065
THE THIRD CONSIDERATION IS IF

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.333
YOU WERE TO PROVIDE FUNDING YOU

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.168
COULD ALSO CONSIDER.

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:37.769
A DOUBLE CHIN SOME SORT OF MATCH

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:39.638
WITH UC'S NON STATE OF FUNDS

00:20:39.705 --> 00:20:40.906
SOURCES.

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:41.873
THE REASON FOR THAT IS USE YOUR

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.574
PIECE.

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.076
ABOUT TEN BILLION DOLLAR

00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:45.577
UNFUNDED LABILITY IT REFLECTS

00:20:45.644 --> 00:20:47.145
THE LIABILITY ACROSS BOTH ITS

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.680
CORE BUDGET AND ITS NON CORE

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:50.148
BUDGET INCLUDING ITS MEDICAL

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:52.150
CENTERS -- HOUSING AND DINING

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:53.385
PROGRAMS.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:54.486
I'M INTO SOME SORT OF MATCH

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.488
WOULD REFLECT THE THOSE NON

00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:58.023
STATE SOURCES ALSO SHARING AND

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.659
CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR PORTION OF

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:02.027
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- BASED

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:02.761
ON PAST CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

00:21:02.828 --> 00:21:04.262
WE'VE HAD WITH YOU SEE WE

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.330
THOUGHT AS A VERY ROUGH RULE OF

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:06.098
THUMB.

00:21:06.164 --> 00:21:07.899
I WANTED A TWO DOLLAR MATCH

00:21:07.966 --> 00:21:09.635
EVERYONE DOLLAR GENERAL FUND

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.269
COULD BE REASONABLE SO IF YOU

00:21:11.336 --> 00:21:12.037
WERE APPROPRIATE TWENTY FIVE

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:12.671
MILLION.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:14.006
OF YOU CAN EXPECT A MATCH FROM

00:21:14.072 --> 00:21:14.906
THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT FIFTY

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:16.308
MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU COULD

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:17.275
WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY TO

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.610
REFINE THAT OF MATCHING

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.545
EXPECTATION MORE IF THAT WAS OF

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.747
INTEREST TO THE COMMITTEE.

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:25.651
KAMALA LET ME JUST MAKE SURE I

00:21:25.717 --> 00:21:28.086
GET THIS.

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.021
SO WE'RE GOING.

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.355
TO WE'RE GOING TO PAY DOWN SOME

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:31.890
UNFUNDED LIABILITY YOU SEE

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:32.524
RETIREMENT.

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.426
THE UC RETIREMENT SYSTEM HAS

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:36.028
SOME COMPONENTS ONE OF THE I

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.796
GUESS THE FACULTY.

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:40.599
THE STAFF ON THE THE NON HEALTH.

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.601
CAMPUS CAMPUSES.

00:21:42.668 --> 00:21:45.570
AND THEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:46.938
EMPLOYED ON THE HEALTH SIDE IF

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.507
YOU SEE YOU SEE HELPS OF

00:21:48.573 --> 00:21:50.342
PHYSICIANS.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.243
NURSES ALLIED HEALTH

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:54.980
PROFESSIONALS [inaudible]

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.648
WIRE WHEEL.

00:21:56.715 --> 00:21:59.384
THE HEALTH SIDE OF THE UC.

00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:01.420
GENERATES A FIRM -- CASH FLOW MY

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.789
RECOLLECTION.

00:22:03.855 --> 00:22:05.924
IS FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:08.060
LAST TIME I SAW THE FINANCIALS

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:11.029
FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEMS SITES.

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:12.497
WHY ARE WE?

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:13.865
DEALING WITH THE UNFUNDED

00:22:13.932 --> 00:22:17.736
LIABILITY FOR THE HEALTH SYSTEMS.

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.271
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IT

00:22:19.337 --> 00:22:22.274
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNTANGLE --

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.876
THE CORE NON CORE PORTION OF THE

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:26.745
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:28.847
IN PAST YEARS WE'VE IT SOUNDS

00:22:28.914 --> 00:22:30.515
LIKE A AS A RUFFLE FROM ABOUT A

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:31.516
THIRD.

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:32.984
OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY COULD

00:22:33.051 --> 00:22:34.453
BE A SORT OF SO SEATED WITH THE

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.721
CORE BUDGET.

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:36.922
I'M I WISH I COULDN'T WE

00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:37.589
COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:38.924
MECHANISM THAT WOULD JUST

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.926
ISOLATE THAT CORE PORTION OF THE

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:42.094
UNFUNDED LIABILITY OTHER THAN

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.261
SORT OF EXPECTING THAT MATCH

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:44.629
THAT'S FOR THE MATCHING

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:46.164
RECOMMENDATION COMES FROM -- BUT

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.833
IN THE PAST YEARS THE STATE

00:22:47.899 --> 00:22:49.267
HASN'T EXPECTED THAT MATCH THOSE

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:51.269
RESULTS THE STATE OF PROVIDED

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:52.771
FOR EXAMPLE PROPOSITION TWO

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:54.639
FUNDS TO HELP ADDRESS THE

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:55.774
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:56.675
AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS BECAUSE

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.676
IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS THE

00:22:57.743 --> 00:22:59.644
UNFUNDED LIABILITY IN SOME TIRED

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:02.080
IT'S BENEFITTED BOTH OF THE CORE

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:03.582
AND NON CORE PORTIONS OF THE

00:23:03.648 --> 00:23:04.649
UNIVERSITY'S BUDGET.

00:23:04.716 --> 00:23:06.618
THAT'S A KEY QUESTION FOR YOU TO

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:07.552
CONSIDER IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:08.420
CAN.

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:09.321
I AM SURE THAT IF YOU'RE IF

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:11.123
YOU'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THE

00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:12.224
UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.425
UC'S NON STATE FUNDS ARE ALSO

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:14.860
CONTRIBUTING TO THAT AND THAT'S

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:15.994
WHERE THE MATCHING.

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.629
A CONSIDERATION COMES FROM.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.164
I GUESS THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.032
TO HAVE THE HEALTH SYSTEMS.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.634
DUMP IN SOME MONEY TO PAY DOWN

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.035
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FROM

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:25.637
WITHIN YOU SEE.

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:26.638
AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WORDS

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:27.973
SUGGESTING YOU COULD CONSIDER IS

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.908
HAVING SOME SORT OF MATCH TO THE

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:30.475
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WELL I'M

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.777
SURE.

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.478
YOU SEEN AND I'LL HAVE SOME

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:34.546
CONVERSATION IN A MINUTE BUT I

00:23:34.613 --> 00:23:36.515
MEAN JUST MAKE SURE HE'S HE'S

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:37.849
FINISHED HE FINISHED.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.184
WE ALSO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.852
THE SECOND OF A BULLET POINT

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:43.221
THERE ON PAGE TWO WHICH IS THE

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:44.656
DYSLEXIA CENTER.

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:45.157
WE THINK THEREFORE

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:45.624
CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.691
LEGISLATURE.

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.493
THE FIRST IS -- WE UNDERSTAND

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.195
THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:54.065
IS -- TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS TO

00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:56.735
TEST AND ADDRESS STUDENTS WHO

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:59.037
HAVE -- DYSLEXIA AND OTHER FORMS

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:00.772
OF LEARNING DISABILITIES THE

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.107
PILOT WOULD BE AT A AT A AT A

00:24:02.174 --> 00:24:03.608
SELECT NUMBER OF SCHOOLS WITH

00:24:03.675 --> 00:24:05.443
THE ULTIMATE INTENTION OF ON

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.611
LEARNING THE RESULTS OF THE

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.480
PILOT AND THEN HOPEFULLY SCALING

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:11.650
IT UP STATEWIDE TO THE EXTENT

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:13.151
THAT THE PILOT IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:14.019
THE FOUR CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:16.988
WHAT WHAT ITS FIRST THAT -- WE

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:18.557
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE I

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:19.257
WORK WITH THE MOST

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.725
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:21.927
THIS PILOT WHEN INTERACT WITH

00:24:21.993 --> 00:24:23.595
THE STATE'S EXISTING SPECIAL

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.130
EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:26.932
INCLUDING THINGS LIKE SOFAS AND

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:28.767
THE REAP REGIONAL DIAGNOSTIC

00:24:28.834 --> 00:24:31.002
CENTERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:33.038
SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- TO HELP IN

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:35.473
THE TESTING AND AND EDUCATING OF

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.943
STUDENTS WHO HAVE.

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.678
LEARNING DISABILITIES.

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:42.848
THE SECOND CONSIDERATION IS --

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:44.516
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE --

00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:45.250
WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:46.918
UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE ULTIMATE

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:48.486
END GAME OF THE PILOTS OF THE

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:49.421
GOOD FOR GOAL IS TO SCALE IT

THIS ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:12.136
WAS THE FACT THAT -- FROM THE

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.472
CITY'S PERSPECTIVE OUR OUR FIRST

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:16.574
AND FOREMOST CALISTA FUNDED THE

00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:17.842
BALANCE OF OUR GRADUATION

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:18.643
INITIATIVE.

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:19.710
THERE'S A NEED FOR ANOTHER

THIRTY MILLION OLLARS FOR THAT

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:22.213
INITIATIVE I THINK IF THAT'S

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.481
FULLY FUNDED.

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:24.815

NINETY THOUSAND DIGITAL STUDENTS

00:36:27.919 --> 00:36:29.220
AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE GOAL

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:30.988
IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:32.490

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.728
GLOBAL AMOUNT AGREES THAT THE

SAY GENERALLY SPEAKING IS IS

00:36:59.684 --> 00:37:01.185
THAT OUR PRIORITY WOULD BE FOR

OUR CORE REQUEST.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.422
THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT

00:37:04.488 --> 00:37:06.357
WE WANT TO ADDRESS OBVIOUSLY BUT

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.692
WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THE

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.260
CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA --

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:11.996

LIMITED GENERAL FUND DOLLARS --

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.605
FOR NOT ONLY THE EDUCATIONAL

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.973
COMPONENT OUR CORE MISSION AS A

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:25.343

ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:28.846
NUMBER OF THESE STUDENTS

AND IT'S A MATTER OF OF

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.998
BALANCING PRIORITIES THE

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.933
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES VERSUS

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.567

I DON'T KNOW IF.

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:51.181
YOU'RE THE RIGHT PERSON TO

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.451
TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:55.552
PROPOSAL.

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.621
THE I. S. THIS BEFORE WHEN WE

SUBJECT.

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.992
BUT WHAT IS THE RIGHT WHAT WAS

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:05.062
THE RATIONALE.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.296
TO BECAUSE THE PROGRAM TO BE

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:08.432
DESIGNED AROUND A CONCENTRATION

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:11.101
GRANT FORMULA FOR EXAMPLE MORE

LUNCH FOSTER KIDS ENGLISH

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.008
LANGUAGE LEARNERS GIVEN THE FACT

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.409
THAT.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:21.145
SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS WITH

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:22.312
SPECIAL NEEDS ARE SPREAD

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:23.380
THROUGHOUT DISTRICTS AROUND THE

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.382
STATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:28.418
HAVE 55% OR NOT.

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:30.187
AND DOESN'T THAT CREATE A SYSTEM

00:46:30.254 --> 00:46:32.689
OF WINNERS AND LOSERS AND ARE WE

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:34.391
DEAL WITH.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.526
RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:36.627
QUESTION SHOVEL DO DEPARTMENT OF

00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:39.429
FINANCE -- SO THE FUNDING IS

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.497
GOING TO LIKE YOU MENTIONED

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:43.200
RIGHT FOCUS ON SCHOOLS WITH OVER

00:46:43.267 --> 00:46:45.702
55% SINCE SIMILAR.

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:46.336
TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.572
CONCENTRATION GRAN AND NOW CFF --

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:49.139
AND IT WAS HARD IT THIS WAY

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.274
BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.808
REALLY FOCUSED ON LOOKING AT AT

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.076
THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:55.379
POVERTY RIGHT -- POVERTY IMPACTS

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:57.080
SO MANY ASPECTS OF A PERSON'S

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:58.682
LIFE IN OF A OF A CHILD'S LIFE

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:00.851
AND SO THE FUNDING IS GOING ON

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.386
IN THIS WAY TO FOCUS ON KIND OF

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:03.620
AREAS OF NEED IN THE STATE TO

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:04.988
HAVE THESE HIGH RATES OF

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.623
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.491
SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.992
AND ALSO HIGH RATES OF STUDENTS

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:11.528
WITH OTHER NEEDS SUCH AS LIVING

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.829
IN POVERTY AND IN YOU KNOW IN

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:15.165
FOSTER CARE -- AND SO IT'S JUST

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.600
AT  DIFFERENT WAY TO KIND OF

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:18.335
TARGET ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:21.805
ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO TARGET

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:22.940
AND I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO DEAL

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.908
WITH THIS IS WE GRAPPLE WITH

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:26.143
DIFFERENCES IN THE BUDGET.

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.611
TO TRY TO RECONCILE THINGS BUT

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.379
I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY -- IT'S

00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.648
ONE LET YOU ALL KNOW CONNECTING

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:35.786
POVERTY WAS WITH THE SPECIAL

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.187
NEEDS AND THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.655
STUDENTS IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:39.723
THAT THEY HAVE AND HOW TO DEAL

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.124
WITH -- SO I'M I'M REALLY HAVING

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:41.992
A DIFFICULT TIME I MEAN IF WE'RE

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.560
TRYING TO RELIEVE POVERTY THERE

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:45.429
OTHER PROGRAMS TO DO THAT I

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:47.531
WOULD THINK IN THIS.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.032
ONE SEEMS TO BE TARGETED TOWARD

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.834
DRIVING MORE MONEY TO DOWN TO

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:52.436
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND INTO

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.438

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:57.207
EDUCATE THOSE IN SOME CASES WAS

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:59.576
VERY VERY DIFFICULT. TO DEAL

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.745
WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND I DON'T

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:03.714
SEE HOW.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.282
I AM HAVING TROUBLE MAKING THE

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:06.250
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.263
HOW THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.564
TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.299
SPECIAL ED MONEY BUT THAT'S A

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:23.834

ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.609
OVERVIEW OF THIS MAN A REVISION.

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:06.977
OF THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.211
THERE ARE REALLY THREE KEY

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.414
NUMBERS TO KIND OF TELL THE TALE

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.082
OF OF THE BUDGET FOR YOU.

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.183
I TURNING TO PAGE ONE OF OUR

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.152
HAND OUT THE FIRST IS SEVEN

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:16.553
HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.088
THAT'S THE TOTAL INCREASE IN THE

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:19.423
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:20.824
GUARANTEE ACROSS THE THREE

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:21.458
BUDGET YEARS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:24.428
AT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:25.095
NINETEEN TWENTY AND SO THAT KIND

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.129
OF TELLS YOU HOW MUCH.

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.464
NEW FUNDING IS POTENTIALLY ON

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.466
THE TABLE FOR THINGS AND

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:30.100
PRIORITIES THAT YOU MIGHT CARE

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:30.734
ABOUT.

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:32.402
MOST OF THAT INCREASE IS

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:34.404
ASSOCIATED WITH EIGHTEEN

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.605
NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:37.240
IT'S RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.276
REVENUE ESTIMATES -- AFTER THE

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:40.444
STATE BUDGET YOU PROBABLY ALL

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.546
KNOW THAT APRIL WAS A PRETTY

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:47.250
GOOD MONTHS -- FOR A STATE TAX

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:49.953
COLLECTIONS -- TURNING TO PAGE

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:50.721
TWO I THINK THE OTHER NEXT KEY

00:49:50.787 --> 00:49:53.123
NUMBER IS THREE HUNDRED AND

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.657
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:54.825
MILLION THAT'S THE SIZE OF THIS

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:55.992
DEPOSIT.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.028
INTO THE STATE'S PROPOSITION

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.563
NINETY EIGHT RESERVE I THIS

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:00.430
ISN'T SOMETHING WHERE THE

00:50:00.497 --> 00:50:02.099
ADMINISTRATION SORT OF LOOKS AT

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.333
EVERYTHING AND JUST PICKS A

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.202
NUMBER THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:07.003
SET OF CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULAS

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.939
THAT DETERMINE.

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:09.840
THE DEPOSIT.

00:50:09.906 --> 00:50:12.609
THEY'RE ALMOST AS COMPLICATED AS

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:13.443
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ITSELF --

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.778
BUT THE KEY THINGS THAT REALLY

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:16.346
TRIGGERED A DEPOSIT ARE THE

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:17.681
STATE ARE RECEIVING CAPITAL

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:20.183
GAINS ABOVE THE LONG TERM

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.119
AVERAGE OF ABOUT 8% OF GENERAL

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:23.253
FUND REVENUE.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.355
AND THEN THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:27.124
EIGHT MINIMUM GARRETT HE ITSELF

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.692
A GROWING MY QUICKLY ARE BEING

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:30.127
ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.795
LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.697
STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND INFLATION

00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:34.464
FACTOR.

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:35.932
AND SO THAT THREE HUNDRED AND

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.100
EIGHTY NINE DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS FOR

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.902
ABOUT HALF OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:40.103
AND FORTY SIX MILLION IN NEW

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:45.275
FUNDING THAT -- IS ASSOCIATED

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:46.410
WITH GROWTH AND A GUARANTEE.

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:47.277
AND THEN THE FINAL NUMBER REALLY

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:49.312
GETS TO THE PROGRAM A COMPONENT

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:49.980
OF THE OF THE ME REVISION.

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:52.382
THIS WITH A BUDGET HAS A HUNDRED

00:50:52.449 --> 00:50:52.983
NINETEEN MILLION IN ADDITIONAL

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.251
FUNDING.

00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:55.051
BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.453
BUDGET. FOR THE SPECIAL

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.988
EDUCATION CONCENTRATION GRANT

00:50:58.054 --> 00:51:00.690
PROPOSAL AS YOU HEARD IT ALSO

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:02.426
MAKES ALL THAT FUNDING ON GOING

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:05.796
INSTEAD OF RELYING ON A MIX OF

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.230
ONE TIME AND I'M GOING FUNDS.

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.799
ARE THE TWO MOST NOTABLE

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.601
PROPOSALS OUTSIDE OF PROPOSITION

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:12.235
NINETY EIGHT YOU ALREADY HEARD A

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:12.936
LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.204
THAT PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.573
PENSION RATE RELIEF IN NINETEEN

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.307
TWENTY THE OTHER PROPOSAL I

00:51:17.374 --> 00:51:19.209
THINK WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE

00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:21.178
I CHANGED TO THE KINDERGARTEN

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:22.512
FACILITY GRANT.

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:23.980
THE GOVERNOR HAS A PROPOSAL TO

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.248
TARGET THOSE GRANTS A LITTLE BIT

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.083
MORE NARROWLY SPECIFICALLY ON

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.418
DISTRICTS THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:29.619
CONVERT PART TAKEN A GARDEN

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:31.188
PROGRAMS THE FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:32.856
HE'S ALSO PROPOSING A LITTLE BIT

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.891
OF A SMALLER -- ALLOTMENT FOR

00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:36.993
THAT PROGRAM DOWN FROM SEVEN

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.061
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:41.765
JANUARY TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION.

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:44.201
UNDER THE MADE THE DECISION.

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:45.435
I PAGE THREE OF OUR HAND OUT IS

00:51:45.502 --> 00:51:46.169
REALLY JUST A OVER JUST AN

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:47.404
OVERVIEW OF ALL OF THE SPECIFIC

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.405
SPENDING PROPOSALS I'LL BE

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:49.439
TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT THOSE

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.475
AND OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO SO

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.043
I WON'T GET INTO THAT LEVEL OF

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:55.011
DETAIL HERE.

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:57.380
I TURNING TO PAGE FOUR WE THINK.

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:59.216
THIS MAY REVISION HAS A NUMBER

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.517
OF POSITIVE ELEMENTS.

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:03.653
WHEN WE LOOK AT ANALYZING?

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.554
A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS W ALWAYS

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.456
HAVE TO START WITH THE ESTIMATES

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.158
OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.559
AND THOSE ARE DRIVEN -- HAVE A

00:52:09.626 --> 00:52:11.094
LOT TO DO WITH WITH WHAT'S

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.462
HAPPENING WITH STATE GENERAL

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.097
FUND REVENUE.

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.232
I REVENUE ESTIMATES THIS YEAR

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.601
ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER -- IN

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:18.568
TERMS OF THE REVENUE THAT

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.270
AFFECTS THE GUARANTEE I THINK

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.105
WE'RE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:25.475
OR SO BELOW THE ADMINISTRATION

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:26.109
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:26.776
MILLION PER YEAR ABOUT THE

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:30.847
ADMINISTRATION AND EIGHTEEN

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:31.448
NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY BY.

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:32.582
ANY SORT OF HISTORICAL STANDARD

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.150
THAT'S A VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:35.452
MOST OF THE DIFFERENCES IN OUR

00:52:35.519 --> 00:52:38.488
ESTIMATES HAVE TO DO WITH -- OUR

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.023
OUTLOOK BEING COMPLETED JUST A

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:40.957
LITTLE BIT LATER WE A LITTLE BIT

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:42.959
BETTER -- MORE UPDATED DATA THAN

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:44.027
THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:52:44.094 --> 00:52:45.362
I WOULD ALSO JUST HAVE DIFFERENT

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:47.097
WAYS OF MODELING -- THE AFFECTS

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.499
OF INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:50.800
CALIFORNIA COMPANIES.

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:51.635
YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS BUT A

00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:53.003
PRETTY HOT TOPIC LATELY AND

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.638
THAT'S HAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:57.674
EFFECT ON SOME OF THE REVENUE

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:58.642
ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE.

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:01.344
ALSO ACROSS THE SEVENTEEN

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:01.912
EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN TWENTY

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:02.479
PERIOD OUR ESTIMATES OF THE

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:03.847
MINIMUM GUARANTEE ARE ONLY TWO

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:05.482
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION.

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.416
ABOVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.618
ESTIMATE SO JUST A VERY SMALL

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:09.986
FRACTION OF THE FUNDING THAT

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:13.256
SCHOOLS ARE ARE ARE RECEIVING.

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.891
WE THINK THE FOR MAKING THE

00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:16.226
FIRST DEPOSIT INTO THE

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.161
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:18.662
IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:53:18.728 --> 00:53:20.597
DEVELOPMENT -- GIVEN ALL OF THE

00:53:20.664 --> 00:53:22.165
COMPLEX CALCULATIONS WE LOOK

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:24.334
PRETTY CLOSELY AT THE NUMBERS TO

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:25.635
THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:29.406
AND WE THINK THAT THEY BUT FROM

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:31.308
AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.577
TO PROPOSITION. TWO FOR THE

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:34.878
FIRST TIME AT THE STATE WILL

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:35.912
REALLY HAVE IT SORT OF A

00:53:35.979 --> 00:53:37.847
DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING --

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:38.949
TO HELP SCHOOLS GET THROUGH THE

00:53:39.015 --> 00:53:40.383
NEXT SORT OF SLOW DOWN OUR

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.319
ECONOMIC RECESSION -- BEYOND

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:43.787
JUST SORT OF GENERAL PURPOSE

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:44.621
RESERVES ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:47.457
BUDGET THESE THIS OP PROPOSITION

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:48.091
NINETY EIGHT RESERVISTS REALLY

00:53:48.158 --> 00:53:50.527
SPECIFICALLY TO HELP SMOOTH OUT

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:51.094
SOME OF THAT VOLATILITY FOR

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:51.828
SCHOOLS.

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:54.164
ALSO I THINK COMPLIMENTS SOME OF

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.831
THE OTHER EFFORTS YOU MAKING TO

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:57.934
TRY -- TO BUT THE STATE BUDGET

00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.936
AND EVEN MORE FIRM FOOTING.

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:01.905
AT IN TERMS OF THE MIX OF ONE

00:54:01.972 --> 00:54:03.673
TIME AN ONGOING PROPOSALS WE

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.141
THINK THIS MAKE THE VISION IS

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:05.742
GENERALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:06.743
DIRECTION.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.612
AT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.480
ACTUALLY PROPOSED SPENDING ABOUT

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.982
EIGHTY MILLION MORE ON ON GOING

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:13.783
PROGRAMS AND IT HAD AVAILABLE

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.518
AND I'M GOING RESOURCES SO THAT

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:17.220
FELT A LITTLE BIT OF A DEFICIT

00:54:17.287 --> 00:54:19.089
INTO THE BUDGET. FOR THE NEXT

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.924
YEAR OTHER MAJOR REVISION

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:23.994
ELIMINATES THAT DEFICIT STILL

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.895
RELIES ON SOME. ONE TIME FUNDS

00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:27.597
TO PAY FOR ONGOING COSTS BUT IT

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.866
ALSO HAS SETS ASIDE SOME OTHER

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:30.734
MONEY FOR THINGS THAT AREN'T ON

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.568
GOING.

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:33.069
AND SO KIND OF TAKING ALL THOSE

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:35.038
FACTORS TOGETHER IT ACTUALLY HAS

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.840
A SMALL SURPLUS OF KIND OF

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:37.707
STRUCTURAL IS WHAT WE THINK OF

00:54:37.774 --> 00:54:39.209
AS A STRUCTURAL SURPLUS OF ONE

00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:40.810
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ON AN

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:44.247
ONGOING BASIS -- FINALLY ON THAT

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.682
CAN OCCUR IN FACILITY GRANT WE

00:54:45.749 --> 00:54:48.551
THINK THAT IS ALSO A POSITIVE

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.452
STEP -- THE CHANGES.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:50.687
THAT ARE IN THE MAY REVISION I

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:52.222
THINK WE'LL GET THE PROGRAM --

00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.623
WHAT CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.191
CORE OBJECTIVE YOU SET FORTH

00:54:55.258 --> 00:54:56.793
WHICH WAS TO ENCOURAGE MORE FULL

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.328
DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS?

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:00.030
COULD ALSO ENCOURAGE MORE LOW

00:55:00.096 --> 00:55:02.032
INCOME DISTRICTS TO APPLY GIVEN

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.099
THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS A LITTLE

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.267
BIT MORE OF THAT MATCH THE LOCAL

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.702
MATCH TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.771
THAN THE STATE TO PICK UP A

00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:09.072
LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE COST.

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:10.373
WE STILL THINK THAT DEMAND FOR

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.474
THE PROGRAM PROBABLY WILL BE

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.709
LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:55:12.776 --> 00:55:13.910
AND SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:15.612
WAYS TO FREE UP FUNDING FOR SOME

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.013
OF YOUR OTHER PRIORITIES --

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.615
LOWERING THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE A

00:55:18.682 --> 00:55:19.749
WE THINK OF VERY REASONABLE

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:22.752
PLACE TO START.

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.054
I FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE FIVE

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.855
OF HIGHLIGHT JUST TO CONCERNS

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:26.423
THAT WE HAVE WITH THE MAJOR

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:27.691
VERSION.

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:30.160
THE FIRST IS THAT THE REALLY THE

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.461
THE BUDGET QUESTION.

00:55:31.528 --> 00:55:33.863
STILL REMAINS VERY SMALL -- BY

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.165
TYPICALLY.

00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:36.466
OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS FOR

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:38.501
EXAMPLE THE STATE SET ASIDE

00:55:38.568 --> 00:55:39.836
ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION KIND

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:41.938
OF AN ONGOING FUNDS FOR ONE TIME

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:42.972
ACTIVITIES.

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.908
AND THAT GIVES YOU A GOOD BUDGET

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.342
CUSHION IN CASE THE MINIMUM

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:48.511
GUARANTEE DECLINES OR SOMETHING

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:49.979
HAPPENS NEXT YEAR THOSE ONE

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:51.648
TIMES FUNDS JUST EXPIRE YOU

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:52.682
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE.

00:55:52.749 --> 00:55:55.351
REDUCTIONS IN ONGOING PROGRAMS.

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.586
AT THE GOT THE MAY REVISION HAS

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:58.922
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN

00:55:58.988 --> 00:56:00.657
KIND OF A A ONE TIME QUESTION.

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.392
BUT THAT'S THAT'S VERY SMALL

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.860
ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.662
TYPE OF DOWNTURN RECESSION THE

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.297
STATE MY EXPERIENCE -- IN THE

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.566
NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND SO AS YOU

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:10.767
START THINKING ABOUT ALL OF

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.168
THESE SORT OF SPECIFIC SPENDING

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:13.236
PROPOSALS.

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:14.404
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THINK

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:17.006
ABOUT SHIFTING EVEN MORE FUNDING

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.074
TO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES A LITTLE

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:21.344
BIT LESS ON ON GOING PROGRAMS.

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:22.479
AND THEN FINALLY I'LL SPEAK TO

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:23.813
THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL I

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.081
KNOW THAT'S A PRETTY HOT TOPIC

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.016
THIS YEAR -- WE HAD WE SHARE

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.518
SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:30.854
THAT YOU REYES MISTER CHAIR --

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:32.388
AND THE WAY I THINK WE

00:56:32.455 --> 00:56:34.691
ARTICULATED IS THAT THIS.

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:38.294
PROPOSAL -- IS ONE WHERE -- THE

00:56:38.361 --> 00:56:39.729
WE THINK THE FISCAL INCENTIVES

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.798
ARE REALLY -- WORKING -- VERY

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.633
MUCH AT ODDS WITH THE INTENT OF

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.335
THE PROGRAM -- THE I THINK THE

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:46.870
GOAL OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:49.038
GRANT WAS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:50.140
OF STUDENTS WERE IDENTIFIED FOR

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:52.175
SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES WHO

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:53.476
NEED EXTRA SUPPORT.

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:55.478
BUT BY TYING THE FUNDING TO THE

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:56.112
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WRITE DOWN A

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:56.846
FIDE.

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:58.148
THE STATE WOULD EFFECTIVELY

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.382
PENALIZE DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.617
SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:02.485
IDENTIFICATION RATES AND REWARD

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:03.920
THOSE TO KEEP IDENTIFICATION

00:57:03.987 --> 00:57:04.988
RATES HIGH.

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.389
AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:08.158
SMALL POTATOES HERE THE ON THE

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:09.292
MARGIN THE AMOUNT FOR PER

00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.693
STUDENT WOULD BE MORE THAN TEN

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.295
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO THAT IS

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.163
GOING TO WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.197
PRETTY STRONG AFFECTING HOW

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:15.665
DISTRICTS THINK ABOUT SPECIAL

00:57:15.732 --> 00:57:17.100
EDUCATION AND HOW MANY STUDENTS

00:57:17.167 --> 00:57:18.668
TO IDENTIFY.

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:19.402
WE THINK YOU HAVE SOME BETTER

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.271
ALTERNATIVES STACK YOU COULD DO

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:22.972
IN PLACE OF THIS PROPOSAL. ONE

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.307
WOULD BE TO EQUALIZING SPECIAL

00:57:24.374 --> 00:57:25.875
EDUCATION FUNDING WE THINK THAT

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.410
COULD.

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:28.444
I PROVIDE DISTRIBUTE FUNDING

00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:30.013
MORE BROADLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:31.815
HISTORICAL INEQUITIES THAT

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:32.415
YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IN

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:33.550
THE PAST.

00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:34.617
WE ALSO THINK YOU COULD THINK

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:35.685
ABOUT HAVING A PROGRAM

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.822
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON AT A

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:39.756
PRESCHOOL.

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.257
SPECIAL EDUCATION CURRENTLY THE

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:42.225
STATE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:43.693
DEDICATED FUNDING FOR THAT EVEN

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.428
THOUGH DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:46.396
PROVIDE IT.

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:47.463
I WE THINK A SMALLER MORE

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.232
TARGETED PROGRAM COULD ADDRESS

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:50.567
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:53.136
ADMINISTRATION IS IDENTIFIED AND

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:55.872
YOU MIGHT HAVE IN THAT AREA.

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:56.506
SO WITH THAT LET ME TURN THINGS

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.640
THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.209
A QUICK RUN.

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:01.277
ON THE PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:02.745
SAID THE BUDGET BUT BEFORE WE DO

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:05.014
THAT I MEAN.

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:06.449
MY CONCERN WITH THE SPECIAL ED.

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.851
PROPOSAL MAYBE PERHAPS I COULD

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:09.853
BECOME CONCERNED ABOUT THE MONEY

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.521
BEING DRIVEN TO ELEAZAR WITH

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.056
MORE THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:13.623
SURE OF STUDENTS WITH

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.457
DISABILITIES.

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:15.959
BUT YOU'RE LEAST DRIVING THE

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:18.194
MONEY DOWN. TWO STUDENTS WITH

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:20.830
SPECIAL NEEDS MY CONCERN IS THIS

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:23.066
55% OF THRESHOLD FREE AND

00:58:23.132 --> 00:58:24.100
REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.335
LEARNERS.

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:27.203
FOSTER KIDS I DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.738
WHAT THAT HAS TO DO.

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:29.973
THE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.475
SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:33.543
DO YOU.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.510
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:36.279
REASON WHY I WOULD SWITCH

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:37.914
SUGGEST WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:40.350
THIS PROPOSAL -- THEY'RE JUST

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:41.784
WAITING BETTER WAYS TO TARGET.

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:44.053
THE MONEY THIS DOESN'T REALLY WE

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.622
THINK GET AT KIND OF THE QUICK

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:47.023
CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.424
TO ADDRESS BECAUSE AS I'VE

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:51.094
IDENTIFIED IN A IN A PREVIOUS.

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.663
SESSION IN THIS BUDGET

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:55.765
SUBCOMMITTEE I HAVE CONCERNS.

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:56.466
WHAT ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:57.133
GRANT ITSELF AND HOW THAT

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.501
OPERATES WHEN YOU HAVE TO

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.236
SCHOOLS ON EITHER SIDE OF A

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.771
DISTRICT LINE? ONE IN THE

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:04.140
DISTRICT WITH 56%.

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.709
AND ONE OF THE DISTRICT OF 46%

00:59:06.776 --> 00:59:07.877
BUT THE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:11.114
EACH HAVE 70% OF THE STUDENTS.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.182
FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH ENGLISH

00:59:13.249 --> 00:59:13.750
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:14.951
KIDS.

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:17.153
AND IT DOESN'T COST ANY LESS TO

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.488
EDUCATE THOSE STUDENTS IN THE

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:21.157
DISTRICT WITH 46%.

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:22.659
THAN IT DOES IN THE DISTRICT

00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.227
WITH 56%.

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:27.830
AND NOW WE'RE LAYERING ANOTHER.

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:30.166
MUCH OF STUFF.

00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.201
A TIED TO CONCENTRATION GRANTS

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.137
SO ANYWAY.

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.772
NOW WE CAN SHIFT OF ANOTHER

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:38.007
GIVEN MY AROUND YOU.

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:40.209
YES MA'AM.

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:41.077
GOOD MORNING THEIR CARD HAS LA --

00:59:41.144 --> 00:59:42.578
I WAS ASKED TO GIVE A HIGH LEVEL

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:44.247
OVERVIEW OF THE EARLY EDUCATION

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:45.415
BUDGET AS A CHILD CARE AND

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:46.282
PRESCHOOL.

00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:48.217
THE MAY REVISION INCREASES --

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:50.186
TELL CAN PRESCHOOL SPENDING BY

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.287
SEVENTY NINE MILLION COMPARED TO

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.889
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THIS

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.324
IS A COMBINATION OF A DECREASE

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.892
IN GENERAL FUND AN INCREASE IN

00:59:55.959 --> 00:59:57.260
FEDERAL FUNDS.

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.128
I'M A FEW MAIN A FEW MAIN THINGS

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.563
TO KNOW WITH THE DIFFERENCES

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.598
BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:03.900
AND THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL.

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.301
ON THE GOVERNOR IN JANUARY

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:07.136
PROPOSED TEN THOUSAND FLIGHTS TO

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.638
START JULY -- ONE AND SOME OF

01:00:08.705 --> 01:00:10.173
THAT DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND IS

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:11.074
BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING THAT

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.443
START DATE UNTIL APRIL ONE SO

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:15.678
DELAYED START SO DELAYED COSTS.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:16.980
ON THIS THIS A SECOND THING WITH

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:21.217
REGARD TO STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:21.918
IS THE GOVERNOR'S WITHDRAWING

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:22.952
HIS THREE YEAR PLAN JUST TO

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:23.987
INCREASE TO PROVIDE THIRTY

01:00:24.053 --> 01:00:25.355
THOUSAND SLOTS WITHIN THREE

01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:25.922
YEARS AND ONLY PROVIDING THE

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:26.656
FIRST.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.224
ONLY PLANS PROVIDE THE FIRST OF

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.292
THOSE.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.260
THE FIRST OF THAT PLAN THE TEN

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:34.998
THOUSAND FLIGHTS -- WE DO NOT

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.666
HAVING A LONG TERM PLAN TO SERVE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.867
LOW INCOME FOR REAL SO TO

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.435
PROVIDE THOSE THIRTY THOUSAND

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:40.269
FOUGHT TO RAISES SOME CONCERNS

01:00:40.336 --> 01:00:41.671
FOR US WITH REMOVING THE WORK

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:42.739
REQUIREMENT.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.007
A WE THINK REMOVING THE WORK

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:47.043
REQUIREMENT COULD RESULT IN

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.311
SERVING FEWER CHIN -- SERVING

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.480
FEWER CHILDREN -- AND SERVING

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:52.448
LESS WORKING FAMILIES -- JUST

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.684
THE WAY SOME OF THE SHIFTING

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.319
MIGHT HAPPEN THAT WITH SOME.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.453
REPHRASE RE RE RAISING SOME OF

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.254
OUR CONCERNS WE'VE HAD IN

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.889

LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLD BY THE

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.161
STATE COULD EXACERBATE SOME OF

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:07.330
THOSE CONCERNS.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.064
THE THE THE IN THE MAY REVISION

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.332

A WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH -- THAT

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:26.482
THESE MAY REFER MAY REVISION

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:29.385

DEVELOP A LOT OF THE TO THE KEY

TWENTY TWENTY SO AND MOVING ON

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.644

GOING.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.255
AND THE GOVERNOR LAYS OUT A PLAN

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.056
FOR HOW TO SPEND THESE FEDERAL

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.192

PROGRAM.

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.030
WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.164
ONE WAY TO SPEND THE FUNDS WITH

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:16.399
THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.700
DISCRETION ON ON HOW TO SPEND

01:02:17.767 --> 01:02:20.002

THE LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:26.576
LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE TO USE

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.810

KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL FOR

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:54.876
FACILITIES WE'RE COMFORTABLE

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:55.677
WITH THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:56.511
DOLLARS.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.980
AND WE DO ASK YOU TO PLEASE FIX

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:00.649
THE ELIGIBILITY ISSUES SO THERE

01:22:00.715 --> 01:22:02.550
IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDS

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:03.351
THAT YOU WOULD RECEIVE IN THIS

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:04.252
PROGRAM.

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:05.887
AND OUR TYPICAL SCHOOL FACILITY

01:22:05.954 --> 01:22:07.289
PROGRAM WHERE SCHOOLS RECEIVE

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.723
FUNDS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.326
MODERNIZATION -- RIGHT NOW A NEW

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:12.460
CLASSROOM THAT YOU WOULD BUILD

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.228
THROUGH THE FULL DAY

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:14.729
KINDERGARTEN SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:16.364
DOLLAR PROGRAM WOULD END UP

01:22:16.431 --> 01:22:18.033
BEING CHARGED AGAINST YOUR BASS

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.068
LINE ELIGIBILITY IN THE SCHOOL

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:21.269
FACILITY PROGRAM.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.404
SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WOULD

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:25.106
BE A HIT AGAINST FUTURE PROJECTS

01:22:25.173 --> 01:22:26.207
THAT A DISTRICT MAY NEED TO DO

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.542
IN THE K. THROUGH SIXTH GRADE

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.243
CATEGORY.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.611
SO NOT JUST KINDERGARTEN IT'S

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:31.012
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN FIX WE

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.180
URGE YOU TO DO SO.

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:33.748
BUT WE ALSO DON'T SEE A NEED TO

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:37.052
ADJUST THE MATCH FROM 5275% THIS

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.186
IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE DOLLARS

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:39.621
IN THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ARE

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.923
BEING TARGETED TO LOW INCOME --

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.591
DISTRICTS THOSE ARE DISTRICTS

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:44.993
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.928
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP PROGRAM WHERE

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:48.496
THEY SEE A LARGER MATCH FROM THE

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:49.264
STATE.

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:51.099
SO THERE'S NO REASON TO ADJUST

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.802
FROM 5275% BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:55.770
ALREADY RECEIVING MORE -- AND

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.472

RIGHT NOW FUNDED ABOUT 30% LESS

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:22.770

THEY HAVE THE SAME OBLIGATION.

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.076
WE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:30.745
PUTTING IN THE MONEY THAT HE'S

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:33.915
PUT IN -- IF THOSE DOLLARS WERE

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.783
EARMARKED TOWARDS EQUALIZATION

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.818
WE WOULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:38.986
THAT GAP.

01:32:39.053 --> 01:32:40.588

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.156
DISTRICTS AND SELF AS AN OUR

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:44.158
HIGHEST FUNDED IT DOESN'T SOLVE

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:45.693
THE ADEQUACY PROBLEM THE FEDERAL
