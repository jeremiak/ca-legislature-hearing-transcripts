00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.353
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ARE THERE

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:22.888
A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE THERE'S

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:24.222
A LITTLE BIT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:26.658
PERHAPS -- IN IN TERMS OF THE

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:27.259
CONSISTENCY JUST WANTED TO

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:31.196
OF THE ALLOCATION ONE FOR EQUITY

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:40.772
AND AND AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:41.573
BIT -- UNUSUAL THERE AND THEN

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.474
THE SECOND PIECES OUT USING

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.242

TO AS IF THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:48.380
INTERESTED COULD CERTAINLY ASK

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:49.781
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.383
RATIONALE FOR USING THE FUNDS

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:52.584
FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT'S THE NEXT

00:25:52.651 --> 00:25:53.852
THING WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.153
THAT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.755
REGARDING THE LEGISLATIVE ROLE

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.556
IN DIRECTING THESE FUNDS.

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.191
AS WELL AS FINANCE MENTION THESE

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:01.226
FUNDS ARE CONTINUOUSLY

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:02.794
APPROPRIATED SO THE LEGISLATURE

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.095
DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.430
APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS.

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.364
I'M AND THERE'S SOME LACK OF

00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:07.799
CLARITY ABOUT IN THE LANGUAGE

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.801
ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:12.270
LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT THE FUNDS.

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:13.905
I'M HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT WE

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:14.940
THINK THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS A

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.875
VERY IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT ROLE

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.243
REGARDLESS OF OF HOW MUCH YOU

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.644
CAN DIRECT THE FUNDS

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:20.378
SPECIFICALLY.

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:22.013
I'M WE RAISE SOME SPECIFIC

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.749
QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE THE

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.117
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER.

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.052
STE ONE HERE ON THE BOTTOM OF

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:28.520
EACH FOR IS WHETHER THE

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:29.487
ADMINISTRATION IS PROVIDED

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:31.189
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON IT

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.524
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.660
WE NOTETHAT THIS PLAN INCLUDES

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:37.195
FOR THE FIRST TIME I FUNDING FOR

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:38.496
SOME NEW PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:39.731
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF SOME

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:41.132
EXISTING PROGRAMS.

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.534
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.069
WANNA MAKE SURE IT IT'S

00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:45.003
UNDERSTANDS AND IS COMFORTABLE

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.438

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:49.641
POPULATIONS ARE GONNA BE SERVED.

00:26:49.708 --> 00:26:51.476
AND YOU KNOW HOW THESE HOW THESE

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.111
FUNDS WILL GO OUT THOSE KINDS OF

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:56.581
THINGS AND SOME CASES -- THERE

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:58.416
THESE PROGRAMS ARE STILL UNDER

00:26:58.483 --> 00:26:59.584
DEVELOPMENT TO DO SO.

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:03.221
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE ARE

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:03.855
STILL IN SOME CASES BEING WORKED

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:04.322
OUT.

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.956
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:05.590
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:06.524
A ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:09.194
NEW POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS --

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.829
THIS PACKAGE OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:12.530
GONNA ENSURE THAT IT HAS

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:14.032
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:15.367
THOSE POSITIONS THERE WEREN'T --

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:16.668
TRADITIONAL BUDGET CHANGE

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:18.403
PROPOSALS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.305
AND SO ON THIS OF THE KINDS OF

00:27:20.372 --> 00:27:22.374
OF THING VILLAGES YOU'RE GOING

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:22.874
TO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT

00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:24.442
UNDERSTANDS -- IN THE CASES

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:25.810
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:26.878
FEEL LIKE IT HAS SUFFICIENT

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.413
INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.814
THESE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WOULD

00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:31.716
OCCUR OR THESE PLANS OUT

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:32.584
CERTAINLY WE THINK IT'S

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.019
APPROPRIATE. TO HAVE THE

00:27:34.085 --> 00:27:35.220
DEPARTMENT'S REPORT BACK AT AT

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:38.690
HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE ON

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:39.491
THOSE PLANS.

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:40.692
THE NEXT MAJOR SET OF QUESTIONS

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:41.292
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.293
WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT OUTCOMES

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.528
THE DEPARTMENTS ARE EXPECTING TO

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.663
ACHIEVE WITH THESE FUNDS.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.664
SO THIS YEAR IN NINETEEN TWENTY

00:27:46.731 --> 00:27:48.466
THE IT'S EXPECTED THAT ABOUT TWO

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:49.000
HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:50.402
AVAILABLE FOR THESE ALLOCATION

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.336
THREE ACTIVITIES THAT COULD

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:53.571
CERTAINLY GROW OVER TIME IS THIS

00:27:53.638 --> 00:27:54.172
MARKET MATURES.

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:54.672
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:56.207
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:27:56.274 --> 00:27:57.709
THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE

00:27:57.776 --> 00:27:59.377
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO MAKE

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.612
SURE THAT IT'S COMFORTABLE ON

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:02.013
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.882
APPROPRIATELY -- IDENTIFIED

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:05.817
OUTCOMES THIS WILL HELP THE

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:06.584
LEGISLATURE MAKE SURE THAT CAN

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.086
HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.822
ACCOUNTABLE -- FOR WHAT IT'S

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:11.990
ACHIEVING.

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:12.490
IN CASES WHERE THE

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:13.324
ADMINISTRATION HS AND IDENTIFY

00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:14.392
THOSE OUTCOMES EITHER THE

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.527
LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THE

00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:17.028
ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT OR IT

00:28:17.095 --> 00:28:18.329
COULD BE EXPRESSED LEGISLATIVE

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:20.732
INTENT -- REGARDING ITS OWN

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.767
GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.035
AND THEN FINALLY -- THE QUOTE

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.270
THE LAST QUESTION THAT WE

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:26.905
HIGHLIGHT IS HOW ON THE

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.840
IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES WILL BE

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.008
MONITORED AND EVALUATED.

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.242
I'M SO WE CERTAINLY THINK IT'S

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:32.644
APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.846
TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.381
TRACK I'M NOT ONLY SAID OUTCOME

00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.516
MEASURES BUT ALSO TRACK HOW IT'S

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:40.652
ACHIEVING THOSE -- FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:41.986
THE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:43.988
THAT REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:45.190
TO PROVIDE OUTCOME ONGOING

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.525
REPORTING ON WHAT IT'S DOING

00:28:47.592 --> 00:28:49.160
WITH THESE FUNDS WHAT OUTCOMES

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:50.762
HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED -- WE ALSO

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:54.165
KNOW JUST ON A TRAILER BILL --

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:55.667
IT IT CAME ALONG WITH THE MAYOR

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:56.634
VISION PACKAGE -- IT PRESENTS A

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.669
NUMBER POLICY CHOICES FOR THE

00:28:57.735 --> 00:29:00.472
LEGISLATURE -- IT PROBABLY TRADE

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:01.406
OFFS ASSOCIATE WITH A VARIETY OF

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.108
THOSE -- AND CERTAINLY IF THE

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.442
LEGISLATURE WANTS ADDITIONAL

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:05.944
TIME WITH THAT AND IT'S PROBABLY

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.679
NOT NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE PART

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:08.513
OF THE BUDGET PACKAGE YOU COULD

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.218
BE -- SEPARATED OUT IF IF THAT

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.586
WAS PREFERRED.

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.321
THANK YOU -- WITH.

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:17.589
COULD YOU GO THROUGH EACH OF

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:21.793
THOSE ISSUES PLEASE AND RESPOND --

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.429
I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE HAND

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.565
OUT IN FRONT OF ME HERE

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:27.866
[inaudible]

00:29:27.932 --> 00:29:33.138
THANK YOU -- I THINK.

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:35.306
AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:36.474
GENERALLY COULD SCENES

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:38.476
CONSISTENT -- I THINK WE DO

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:39.711
THINK THAT THEY ARE IN FACT

00:29:39.777 --> 00:29:41.746
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENTIONS

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:44.315
AND ALLOWABLE USES UNDER PROP

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:45.049
SIXTY FOUR FOR BOTH THE EQUITY

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:49.020
PROGRAM AND THE CHILD CARE SPOTS --

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:51.122
EQUITY PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.724
THE BEER OF CANS CONTROL IF YOU

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.959
READ THE STATUTORY.

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:57.195
USES THEY CAN GO TO ADMINISTER

00:29:57.262 --> 00:30:00.165
IMPLEMENT ENFORCE -- ACTIVITIES

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.233
THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER THE

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.269
BEING PICO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.403
THE EQUITY PROGRAM IS WITHIN

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.405
THAT CODE -- AND WE THINK THAT

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.574
THAT MAKES SENSE -- THE CHILD

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.476
CARE SLIDES -- ARE FUNDED OUT OF

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:14.379
THE USE PROGRAM AND IT BASICALLY

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:16.281
SPECIFIES THAT THAT THE PROGRAM

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.382
SHALL EMPHASIZE ACCURATE

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:19.317
EDUCATION EFFECTIVE PREVENTION

00:30:19.384 --> 00:30:20.818
EARLY INTERVENTION SCHOOL

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.287
RETENTION AND TIMELY TREATMENT

00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:23.588
SERVICES FOR YOUTH THEIR

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:25.456
FAMILIES THEIR CAREGIVERS.

00:30:25.523 --> 00:30:27.192
ALSO AGAIN WE THINK THAT --

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.726
SUBSIDIZING CHILD CARE FOR

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:30.695
INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES TO KEEP

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:32.096
THESE CHILDREN IN OCCUPIED

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.598
ENGAGED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.533
US -- DISCOURAGING SUBSTANCE USE

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.834
DISORDER DOES MAKE SENSE AND

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:42.140
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION --

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:42.740
SIXTY FOUR I THINK THAT'S WHAT

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:43.174
I'VE HEARD THE MOST.

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.209
CONCERN.

00:30:44.275 --> 00:30:47.111
IT IS THE IS THE ISSUE OF KIND

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:50.315
THE CHILDCARE SLOTS WITH THIS.

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.317
UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I DEFINITELY

00:30:52.383 --> 00:30:55.553
THINK THAT IT'S FITS WITHIN THE

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.055
ALLOWABLE USES BUT A YOU KNOW

00:30:57.121 --> 00:30:58.423
ADMITTEDLY IT'S THAT.

00:30:58.489 --> 00:30:59.657
PROBABLY ISN'T ON THE FOREFRONT

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:02.060
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS WHEN THEY READ

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:05.363
READ THE LANGUAGE -- SO.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.233
THE LEGISLATURE PLAYING -- AN

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:11.135
OVERSIGHT ROLE -- I THINK THE

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.637
ADMINISTRATION IS.

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:15.773
DOING -- OUR BEST HERE TO BE --

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.610
PARTNERS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.011
WHERE SHARING -- THROUGH THE

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.546
EIGHT PAGES WE HAVE LIKE A TEN

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.014
PAGE DOCUMENT WE'VE BEEN MEETING

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.449
WITH STAFF HOT AND DOING SOME

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:25.650
BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.618
THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.019
AVAILABLE SO WE UNDERSTAND

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:30.054
WITHIN THE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:31.756
BUT ALSO REALIZING THAT THIS IS.

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:32.924
A LITTLE AND TRADITIONAL IN THAT

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:35.693
IT'S CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED --

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.162
FINDING -- IN THAT.

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.598
PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR BASICALLY.

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.166
TOLD US THAT THIS MONEY WOULD

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.067
BECOME AVAILABLE WE SHOULD

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:44.836
GENTLY SPEND ON THESE ACTIVITIES

00:31:44.902 --> 00:31:46.904
AND THEN ACTUALLY DETERMINED

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.239
WITHIN THESE COMPONENTS WHO

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:50.074
SHOULD SELECT WHAT THOSE

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.110
ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE SO -- I

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:54.012
THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:56.981
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND TRY --

00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:58.316
TO KEEP DOING THAT THROUGH THE

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:01.286
BUDGET PROCESS AND YOU KNOW I

00:32:01.352 --> 00:32:02.887
THINK WE SHARE IN THE CONCERN OF

00:32:02.954 --> 00:32:04.555
MAKING SURE THAT THESE

00:32:04.622 --> 00:32:06.257
INVESTMENTS GO -- TO MEANINGFUL

00:32:06.324 --> 00:32:07.592
OUTCOMES ABOUT WE HAVEN'T%

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:09.360
ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING FORMALLY

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.797
I WOULD SAY YOU TO SORT OF

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:13.665
SOLIDIFY THAT.

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:14.465
SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF MORE

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:17.302
SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH ON A ON

00:32:17.368 --> 00:32:18.836
GOING BASIS THE LEGISLATURE.

00:32:18.903 --> 00:32:23.207
WOULD BE INVOLVED OR I AGAIN I

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.576
THINK WE'RE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW --

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.577
WITH THE RELEASE OF THE MAY

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:27.612
REVISION SHARING THIS

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:30.081
INFORMATION SHARING OUR PLANS

00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:32.350
THROUGH -- NARRATIVE DOCUMENTS

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.252
MEETING WITH FOLKS -- AND SO I

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:35.787
THINK WE ARE TRAINED TO KEEP THE

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:37.388
LEGISLATURE AND INVOLVED AND

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:39.357
ENGAGED BY ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:40.925
IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT IT'S

00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:42.360
NOT A BUDGET ACT PREPARATION.

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:43.795
AND NOT AND GOING TO THAT

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:45.663
TRADITIONAL PROCESS BUT WE'RE

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.799
HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN WHAT AND

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:49.000
WHATEVER WAYS THROUGH HEARINGS

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:50.501
AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.669
LIKE WE ARE TODAY.

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:55.640
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:56.240
FULL UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE

00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.076
TRYING TO DO.

00:32:58.142 --> 00:32:59.844
OKAY BOOM I THINK THERE'S A FEW

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:05.750
MORE OF WITH REGARDS TO ONE

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:06.751
HUNDRED EIGHT THIS THE STAFFING

00:33:06.818 --> 00:33:08.886
THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:11.155
STAFFING.

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:13.391
YES SO -- THERE ARE A HUNDRED

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:15.293
EIGHTY POSITIONS I THINK -- A

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.128
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE WE

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:19.630
HAVE PROVIDED SORT OF AT LEAST --

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:21.432
I'VE OF PARAGRAPH OR SO PER

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.000
PHYSICIAN OR GENTLY WHAT THOSE

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.335
POSITIONS WILL BE DOING FOR A

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:25.636
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE GOES

00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:28.639
AND SOME OF THOSE ARE REALLY --

00:33:28.706 --> 00:33:29.974
I WOULD SAY THAT THE POSITIONS

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.809
KIND OF FALL INTO SIN GENERAL

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.411
CATEGORIES OF GRANT

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:35.847
ADMINISTRATION AND ADDITIONAL

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:37.148
SORT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.850
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE TODAY OR

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.418
THAT WILL HELP FURTHER SORT OF

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.787
ACTIVITIES THAT WERE SPECIFIED

00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.255
IN PROPOSITION.

00:33:44.322 --> 00:33:45.957
SIXTY FOUR SO I DO THINK THAT WE

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:48.126
HAVE PROVIDED GENERALLY --

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:49.260
INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:51.396
POSITIONS WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING --

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:52.597
AND I THINK THEY ARE SORT OF

00:33:52.663 --> 00:33:54.098
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:58.836
INTENDED UNDER PROPOSITION.

00:33:58.903 --> 00:33:59.871
SIXTY FOUR AND WITH REGARD TO

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:02.440
THE OUTCOMES THE YOU COULD CHECK

00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:06.077
OUT HOW WILL YOU GET TO THOSE IN.

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:09.447
DEVELOP THOSE OUTCOMES -- AS I

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:11.282
KIND OF MENTIONED THAT SOME OF

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.851
THESE ALREADY I THINK HAVE IT

00:34:13.918 --> 00:34:15.019
REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON THE

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:16.354
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM AND WHAT

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:17.789
WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I THINK

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:19.056
EACH ONE OF THEM.

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:22.860
HAS IS WAS SELECTED -- BECAUSE

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:23.928
ONE WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT IT'S

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.596
A WORKING PROGRAM AND WE WANT TO

00:34:25.663 --> 00:34:28.032
INVEST MORE IN THAT AREA BECAUSE

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:30.268
WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A NEED --

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.303
OR THAT WE SHARED SHARING YOUR

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.805
INTEREST OF MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:34:33.871 --> 00:34:34.872
HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES BUT SOME

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:36.107
OF THESE ARE SO NEW THAT WE

00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:37.608
HAVEN'T RELEASED IT UP.

00:34:37.675 --> 00:34:38.910
A COUPLE OF LIKE THREE OF THESE

00:34:38.976 --> 00:34:40.478
GRANT PROGRAMS I THINK THIS IS

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:41.746
PROBABLY A LITTLE PREMATURE TO

00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:43.514
DETERMINE WHAT OUTCOMES WILL

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.782
ULTIMATELY BE CHEATED BUT WE'RE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.017
GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:48.719
TRY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:49.854
THOSE AREAS.

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:50.855
YES SIR TO SEEMS LIKE IF YOU'RE

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.723
NOT SURE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.091
THAT YOU WANTED CHIEF HOW DO YOU

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:56.093
COME UP WITH A NUMBER OF A

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.329
HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS.

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.231
YEAH THOSE HUNDRED EIGHTY ARE

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:01.732
SPREAD ACROSS ACROSS A LOT OF

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:03.601
AREAS I THINK GENERALLY THE MOST

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:05.169
OF THEM FALL INTO THE

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.705
ENFORCEMENT -- OF ILLEGAL

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.807
CULTIVATION AND REMEDIATION AND

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:11.642
CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES AND THE

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.010
RESOURCES BUCKET.

00:35:13.077 --> 00:35:15.680
OUR COMPONENT OCASIONES SORRY --

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:18.182
AND SO I THINK THAT AGAIN AND

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.851
SOME OF THOSE FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:22.019
IN PARTICULAR ALREADY HAS SOME

00:35:22.086 --> 00:35:23.488
OF THOSE POSITIONS AND IS DOING

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:24.689
SOME OF THAT WORK TODAY SO IT'S

00:35:24.755 --> 00:35:26.557
REALLY JUST AN EXPANSION OF

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:29.193
EXISTING ACTIVITY -- AND I THINK.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.261
I THINK THOSE DEPARTMENTS WOULD

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.062
TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.763
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.000
CULTIVATION -- THAT IS OUT THERE

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:38.102
THAT NEEDS TO ONE BE ENFORCED

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:39.537
AGAINST AND THEN AFTER BE

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.639
REMEDIATED AND CLEANED UP AND SO

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.941
I THINK THIS IT WILL HLP US.

00:35:44.008 --> 00:35:44.976
YOU KNOW START TO MOVE TOWARD

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.944
THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IN ANYWAY

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.513
IT'S YOU KNOW IN A STE POLICE

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:52.917
ALL OF THE PROBLEM.

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:54.118
I FIGURE WITH.

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.786
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET -- WHAT

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.154
YOU EXPECTS SPRINGS HAS BEEN UP

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:58.322
UNTIL NOW?

00:35:58.389 --> 00:35:59.824
WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT

00:35:59.891 --> 00:36:00.858
YOU'RE?

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:02.894
YOU KNOW I THINK IT GIVES US A

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.262
BASE FROM WHICH IS THE OKAY.

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.163
THIS MAKES SENSE HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.832
OR NINETY WHATEVER IN THE IN THE

00:36:07.899 --> 00:36:09.333
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU'RE HERE

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.635
ALLOCATED STUFF.

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:14.138
BUT IT'S WHEN YOU WILL ONLY SEE

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:15.873
IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY NEW

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.142
POSITIONS BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT

00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.844
IS LINKED TO AND I THINK MAKES

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:21.546
IT [inaudible]

00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.581
MORE DIFFICULT.

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:25.216
A DIFFICULT FOR US IS THE

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:25.516
LEGISLATURE.

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:27.485
IN A WE HAVE SHARED SOME

00:36:27.552 --> 00:36:29.353
ADDITIONAL DETAILS WITH THE LA --

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.355
AND STAFF ON SOME OF THESE

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.290
PIECES.

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.992
AND SPEAKING TO THE HUNDRED AND

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:35.927
EIGHTY I I DON'T KNOW OFF THE

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.461
TOP OF MY HEAD THE NUMBER THAT

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:38.029
WE'VE SHARED SOME OF THOSE

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:39.497
DETAILS BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:42.300
OVER 50% OF THOSE.

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.234
WE'VE SHARED -- KIND OF IT WHAT

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.435
WHAT ACTIVITIES WILL BE TAKING

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.970
PLACE AND THEN LIKE IT'S IN SOME

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:46.971
OF THESE OTHER ONES ARE SMALLER

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:48.573
AND IT'S MORE A GRANT

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:49.607
ADMINISTRATION.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:52.944
TYPE OF ACTIVITY MORE

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.245
ADMINISTRATIVE WORK [inaudible]

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:56.881
SENATOR YES.

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:58.516
I'D LIKE TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.384
ON THE CONCERNED JUST RAISED.

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:01.886
BUT THE CHAIR AND AND ON OTHERS

00:37:01.953 --> 00:37:03.955
AS WELL.

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:07.058
THIS IS A VERY MAJOR.

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.392
POLICY CHANGE IN THE HISTORY OF

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:11.262
CALIFORNIA.

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.064
AND HOW CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.365
CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS AND RAISE

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:16.701
OUR CHILDREN.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:17.602
THE SOCIETAL IMPACTS ARE VERY

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.770
SIGNIFICANT.

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:22.273
SO THE IMPLEMENTATION CANNOT BE

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.140
TAKEN CASUALLY.

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:26.777
IN MY OPINION.

00:37:26.844 --> 00:37:28.346
IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT.

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:31.148
ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN TO THE

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:32.984
REGULATORY PROCESS AS YOU

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.251
PROMULGATE.

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:38.322
AS YOU MOVE AHEAD THE POLICIES.

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.223
TO TO HANDLE CANNABIS IN

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.825
CALIFORNIA WILL THEY BE DONE

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.425
REGULATORY EARLY.

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:44.862
IS THAT A PART OF IT -- WELL

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.731
THAT THREE MAIN LICENSING

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:49.734
ENTITIES -- DID -- COMPLETE

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.636
THEIR FINAL REGULATIONS IN

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.037
JANUARY I THINK TWO THOUSAND OLD

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:54.605
REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:55.640
CONTINUE TO BE A PART.

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:57.775
YEAH YEAH I MEAN I DO THINK THAT

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:59.010
THAT'S TYPICAL FOR THERE'S ALL

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.444
KIND OF THINGS ARE GOING TO COME

00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:03.414
UP AS THIS MOVES ALONG AND IT

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.249
NEEDS TO BE DONE REGULATORY NOT

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:06.183
BY FIA.

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.219
MEANING YOU TO STILL PUT OUT A

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:09.020
MEMO AND SAYING THIS IS A NEW

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.689
DEAL YOU'VE GOT A REGULATION.

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:14.492
AND A STATUTE TO SUPPORT.

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:15.660
THE REGULATIONS SO.

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:19.330
JUST A REMINDER [inaudible]

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:23.501
AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW IN THIS

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:25.803
WHOLE REALM.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:26.871
WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE?

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:29.540
OVERSIGHT IS.

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:31.075
THE WHOLE THING SOUNDS A LOT

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.943
LIKE [inaudible]

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.513
UC'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:38.449
[inaudible] TO MEET.

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:40.151
END OF THAT IS INDEED OF SOME

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:42.486
CONCERN.

00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:43.854
AND DO UNDERSTAND CONTINUES

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.322
APPROPRIATION DOESN'T MEAN

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:47.825
AUTOMATIC PROBATION FOREVER THAT

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:48.059
CAN BE.

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.794
CHANGED.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.095
I DON'T HAVE A LEGAL OPINION HOW

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.263
THAT BOUNCES UP AGAINST

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:53.798
INITIATIVE BUT IT IS OF SOME

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:56.834
CONCERN.

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.969
AND THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:01.005
CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY.

00:39:01.072 --> 00:39:02.973
THE MONITORING.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.109
IN THE STABLISHMENT OF GOALS

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:05.409
[inaudible]

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:07.578
THIS CRITICAL.

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.879
AND WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY AS

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.581
WELL AS JUST GOING TO INVOLVED

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.349
IN WILL GET AROUND TO IT.

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.951
NOT ENOUGH SERIOUSNESS ABOUT IT

00:39:14.018 --> 00:39:15.619
AND I HEAR THAT.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.088
IN THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR YOU

00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:20.925
HEAR THAT IN MY COMMENTS. TO TO

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:22.093
PRESENT THIS WHOLE NEW

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:23.627
EXPERIMENT.

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.063
IN THIS STATE.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.399
AND HAVE IT WORK.

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:29.734
THINGS NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR AND

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.569
MONITOR.

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:33.137
AND I WOULD ARGUE PARTICULARLY

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.807
IN THIS SENSITIVE AREA. ONE OF

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:37.742
OUR GREATEST PROBLEMS IN

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.777
GOVERNMENT IS WE PASS MILLIONS

00:39:39.844 --> 00:39:41.412
OF BILLS [inaudible]

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.848
YEAH MILLIONS [inaudible]

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:46.617
OVER DECADES.

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:49.153
BUT WITH A LITTLE HEAT. TO

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.223
MONITORING THE SUCCESSES.

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:54.258
A NEW PROGRAM.

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:56.193
THEN THE WE WATCH THE PROGRAM

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.162
AND DO WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.897
THE PROGRAM OR THEIR BENCHMARKS

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:00.798
OTHER MILESTONES [inaudible]

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.666
FAILURES.

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:04.168
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIGH TECH IN

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:08.139
CALIFORNIA IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE.

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:10.241
I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THAT

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:10.541
[inaudible]

00:40:10.608 --> 00:40:12.276
HAPPEN HERE.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:17.114
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE.

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.182
YOU TO GET A LOT MORE SERIOUS.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.251
ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS.

00:40:20.317 --> 00:40:22.153
AND ABOUT THE GOALS SO THEN WE

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.321
HAVE A BENCHMARK.

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:26.857
WITH THE INFORMATION WE GET. TO

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.927
REFERENCE AND JUDGE.

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:35.399
THANK YOU GIPSON.

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:37.601
UNDER ANY INCREASES.

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:40.304
I'M SO I I THINK ONE THING THAT

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.908
WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IS.

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:46.043
A LOT MORE EXPLICITLY THAN

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.812
WHAT'S HERE [inaudible]

00:40:47.878 --> 00:40:49.647
IS WHAT.

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.015
YOU KNOW WHAT THE BREAKDOWN OF

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:53.951
AUTHORITY IS.

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:55.853
THE GOVERNOR AND WHERE THE

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.656
LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IS.

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:02.593
WHERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF --

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.595
WILL.

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:07.097
IT WILL BE CORDIAL AND LET THE

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.966
LEGISLATIVE YOU KNOW LET THE

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.201
LEGISLATION NO.

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:13.204
OR HOW MUCH OF A REQUIREMENT IS

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.404
THAT.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.773
TO CONSULT SO I THINK THAT KIND

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.374
OF CLARITY BETWEEN WHAT THE

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.542
GOVERNOR'S.

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.444
ROLL AND WHAT THE LEGISLATORS

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:23.547
ROLE LEGISLATIONS ROLE IS WOULD

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.816
BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I A I

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:28.285
KNOW THIS WAS PASSED WITH SOME

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:28.485
VERY.

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:31.388
EXPLICIT OF THINGS THAT NORMALLY

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:46.810
AMERICA'S CANADA AND MEXICO.

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:49.746
IN EUROPE IT'S GERMANY THE

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:52.515
NETHERLANDS AND THE UK.

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:53.550
A IN THE E. U. IN GENERAL AND IN

00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.051
ASIA IT'S CHINA JAPAN.

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.320
KOREA INDIA HONG KONG AND

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.723
VIETNAM.

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.524
SO I THINK THAT -- THIS IS A

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:02.892
VERY MINIMAL INVESTMENT.

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.928
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES FOR

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.429
EXAMPLE JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME.

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:11.067
PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WASHINGTON HAS.

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.369
SIX PEOPLE IN THIS AREA.

00:56:13.436 --> 00:56:15.271
IT IS. FIVE POINT CALIFORNIA'S

00:56:15.338 --> 00:56:16.573
FIVE POINT THREE TIMES AS LARGE

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.308
AN ECONOMY.

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.944
MINNESOTA HAS TWELVE PEOPLE IN

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:21.511
THEIR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.113
GROUP.

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.380
WE ARE EIGHT TIMES LARGER AS AN

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.015
ECONOMY.

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.284
IN COLORADO HAS TEN PEOPLE WE

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.153
ARE A POINT ONE TIMES AS LARGE

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:30.453
[inaudible]

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.489
SO.

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.357
THERE HAS TO BE A MINIMAL

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:35.492
INVESTMENT WE HAVE.

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.627
HUNDREDS OF DELEGATIONS COMING

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.229
TO SEE US WE HAVE THE

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:40.897
OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERT THOSE

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.699
INTO INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.100
AND CALIFORNIA JOBS.

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:45.935
BUT WE WE CANNOT CONTINUE THIS

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:47.437
LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IF WE WANT

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:48.438
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:49.806
AND IF WE WANT TO REVERSE THE

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.674
DECLINE IN OUR MARKET SHARE FOR

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.543
EXPORTS IN OUR MARKET SHARE FOR

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.845
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT.

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:58.148
THEY ARE GOING TO OTHER STATES.

00:56:58.214 --> 00:57:00.049
CAN YOU GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:01.084
ABOUT HOW.

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:04.053
HAVING THE STAFF WOULD.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.922
BLOOM PRODUCE GREATER RESULTS

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:06.890
AND WHAT WE'RE GETTING

00:57:06.956 --> 00:57:08.892
ESPECIALLY IN A MORE COMPETITIVE.

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:11.661
SURE WORLD -- FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF

00:57:11.728 --> 00:57:12.996
THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO THERE

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.899

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:18.568
COMMERCIAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE.

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:19.936
THEY HAVE TWELVE OFFICES IN

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:21.838
CALIFORNIA AND THEY ALSO HAVE AN

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:23.773
OFFICE IN EVERY EMBASSY AROUND

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.142
THE WORLD THIS IS U. S. OFFICES.

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:28.978
ON I WANT TO DEVELOP VERY%

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:31.514
FOCUSED BUSINESS PLANS OFFER A

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.082
FIFTEEN TOP EXPORT AND FOREIGN

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:34.617
DIRECT INVESTMENT MARKETS THE

00:57:34.684 --> 00:57:36.052
COUNTRIES THAT I JUST NAMED.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.654
WHERE WE WOULD WORK HAND IN

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.055
GLOVE WITH US COMMERCIAL

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.324
SERVICES TO INCREASE THE LEADS?

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:42.959
INCREASE THE MARKET ENTRY

00:57:43.026 --> 00:57:45.562
STUDIES -- INCREASE THE TRADE

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.096
MISSIONS -- AND BE ABLE TO

CONVERT THOSE INTO TANGIBLE

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:50.366
BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE OF

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:51.000
CALIFORNIA.

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:53.937
SO SOME OF IT IS ALSO WORKING

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:54.504
DIRECTLY WITH OUR REGIONAL

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.672
PARTNERS.

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:58.174
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT OUR OFFICE

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.043
IS CLOSING IN TWO THOUSAND THREE

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.844
WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.045
THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE GOTTEN

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.813
A LOT STRONGER.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:05.081
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ALLEY CHAMBER

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:08.284
WHO'S HERE TODAY THEY'RE HAVING

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:10.820
THEIR SACRAMENTO DAY -- WHERE

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.355
THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL EDC OR

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:13.590
THE FRESNO BUSINESS COUNSELOR

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:14.424
EDC?

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.526
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:18.127
ZERO STATE SUPPORT.

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:18.862
THEY HAVE HAD TO GET A LOT

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.263
STRONGER AND NOW IT HAS BEEN

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.331
GREAT.

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:22.732
BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE ALL

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:24.567
WORK TOGETHER.

00:58:24.634 --> 00:58:26.369
IS REALLY SHARE BETTER HAVE A

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:27.971
BETTER DIRECTION.

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:30.406
NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS AND BE IN

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:31.975
A POSITION TO REALLY LEVERAGE

00:58:32.041 --> 00:58:34.077
THAT NEW FOUND POWER THAT WE

00:58:34.143 --> 00:58:36.412
HAVE IN THE CALIFORNIA REGIONS

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:37.614
AND EXTENDED OUT TO THE WORLD.

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.282
SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:41.918
THINGS THAT I WOULD SEE US DOING

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:45.421
MORE OF CENTER [inaudible]

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.757

GOVERNMENT AND AND THIS IS MY

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:06.242
OPINION -- ANTIPATHY IN TERMS OF

CALIFORNIA WE SEE ANYTHING.

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.513
CHANGE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS --

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.816
WITH RESPECT TO OF FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:17.186

ORGANIZATIONS.

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.927
I'LL GIVE YOU A TWO PART ANSWER

00:59:23.993 --> 00:59:25.461
THE FIRST PART IS THAT.

00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:27.764
GENERALLY WHAT WE FIND -- IN THE

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:28.698
U. S. COMMERCIAL SERVICES WHICH

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.533
IS A PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:31.267
COMMERCE.

00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:34.170
THE THE PERSONNEL THAT IS

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.672
DIVIDED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND IS

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.240
FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA NO I

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:39.842
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THEY WANT

00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:41.544
TO HELP US THEY'RE ACTIVELY

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:42.879
ENGAGE WITH US IN FACT I HAVE A

00:59:42.946 --> 00:59:43.646
MEETING WITH THE SOUTHERN

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:44.647
CALIFORNIA.

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:47.917
HEAD THAT COVERS THE ARIZONA AND

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:49.352
NEVADA AND HAWAII AND SO THE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:50.753
CALIFORNIA TOMORROW DOWN IN

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.188
ORANGE COUNTY SO.

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.157
AND AND THE ONES UP HERE THE THE

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:55.191
REGIONAL HAD FOR NORTHERN

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:56.826
CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THE

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:58.294
WESTERN STATES IS IN UTAH BUT

00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:59.529
HE'S VERY COOPERATIVE AND AND

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:03.099
GOOD.

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.735
THE TWELVE OFFICES AGAIN.

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:06.336
A COOPERATIVE IN FACT SOME OF

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.037
THEM ARE HEADING OF CALIFORNIA

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.073
DISTRICT EXPERT COUNCILS SO THAT

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:15.778
I THINK -- HAS BEEN GREAT -- WAS

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:19.015
MY SECOND POINT.

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.383
MY POINT WAS GIVEN WHAT I

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.484
BELIEVE TO BE THE TIP OF THE OF

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.051
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:22.986
RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS OF THE

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.020
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:24.787
ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS.

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.990
CALIFORNIA WEATHER'S BEEN A

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:28.891
CHANGE YES -- MY I REMEMBER

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:29.892
START -- THE SECOND POINT IS WE

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:30.994
HAVE SOMETHING A FEDERAL PROGRAM

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.329
CALLED STEP IT'S THE STATE TRADE

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.797
EXPORT PROMOTION PROGRAM.

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:37.200
PART IT THIS IS AN ANTIPATHY BUT

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.135
IT'S BAKED INTO THE LAW -- IT

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:39.969
WAS.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.938
DEVELOPED BY SOME SENATORS FROM

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:43.806
SMALLER STATES SAYS ABOUT

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:44.874
SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.743
DOLLARS AVAILABLE AND THESE ARE

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:47.877
THREE TO UP TO THREE THOUSAND

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:51.114
pBUSINESSES.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:51.914
WORKING WITH ISABEL'S GROUP

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.283
OUGHT TO DO MARKET ENTRY -- BUT

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.253
STUDIES OR TO GO INTO ON A TRADE

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.255
MISSION OUT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY --

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.758
WE ARE CAPPED AT NINE HUNDRED

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.425
THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S THE MOST

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.260
THAT ANY STATE CAN GET.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.262
THAT'S ABOUT 5% OF THE MONEY BUT

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.931
WERE ABOUT 12% OF THE POPULATION.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.434
WERE THE NUMBER ONE TRADE STATE

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.668
WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN AGRICULTURAL

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.637
EXPORTS NUMBER WHEN A MACHINERY

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:15.638
EXPORTS NUMBER ONE ELECTRONICS

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:16.205
EXPORTS.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.507
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.342
WE'RE DOING WELL AND WE NEED TO

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:21.744
CONTINUE TO DO WELL -- BUT IT'S

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.147
HARD WHEN WE CAPPED AT 5% SO I

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.149
WOULDN'T CALL THAT ANTIPATHY BUT

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:30.253
I WOULD SAY IT IS BAKED INTO THE

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:33.189
LAW AND I BET.

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.690
THAT'S THE CHANGE THE LAST TWO

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:36.392
YEARS NOW NOW THAT HASN'T

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.160
CHANGED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SO

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.795
BUT BUT MY SECOND POINT IS IS

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:39.462
THAT THAT THERE'S A I GREW UP IN

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:40.263
THE MIDWEST THERE'S A REASON WHY

01:01:40.329 --> 01:01:41.330
STATES IN THE MIDWEST SUCH AS

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:42.265
MINNESOTA NEED TO DEVOTE.

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.901
FAR MORE RESOURCE TO TRACK

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:45.835
BUSINESS THERE THAN CALIFORNIA

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:46.135
[inaudible]

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.837
DOM.

01:01:47.904 --> 01:01:49.705
WELL BUT THAT'S JUST JUST A

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:51.441
COMMENT YOU DON'T NEED THE ONLY

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:52.408
RESPOND TO THAT WELL IT.

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.444
IT'S TRUE -- WE HAVE SOME --

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.545
GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGES THAT ARE

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:59.015
AMAZING AND BUT WE ARE LOSING

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:03.486
SHARE SO THOSE ARE THE FACTS --

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.554
I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.923
SAYING THERE I SERVED ON THE LA

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:09.492
CONVENTION VISITORS -- BOARD --

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.660
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:14.664
AND LOS ANGELES BEING WELL KNOWN

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.732
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BEGAN TO

01:02:16.799 --> 01:02:18.000
SORT OF KICK BACK.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:20.736
AND JUST LET OUR REPUTATION.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.572
YES AND WE BEGAN TO SUFFER

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.873
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T PAYING

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.808

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:16.325
BASICALLY GOVERNED BY THE

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:16.993
INDUSTRY.
