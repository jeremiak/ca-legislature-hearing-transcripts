SAID SO THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:26.817
IS -- RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:30.954
WRITTEN I THINK COUNTIES OVER --

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:31.755
SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND AND THEN

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:34.024
COUNTIES BETWEEN TWO FIFTY AND

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:34.591
SEVENTY THOUSAND SUBJECT TO

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:35.625
APPROPRIATION.

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.860
AND IS ONE THING WE HAVE TO

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:37.461
MENTION AND WE'VE TAKEN SOME

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:39.830
AMENDS TO MAKE -- THIS PROCESS

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.164
SIGNIFICAN LESS EXPENSIVE THAT

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:43.600
HAVE BEEN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED.

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:45.035
I THINK MOST OF THE INITIAL

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.603
REACTION FROM THE COUNTIES WAS

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.805
THEY WORRY ABOUT EXPENSE -- BUT

00:51:48.872 --> 00:51:51.408
NOW THAT WE HAVE THE GRAND JURY

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:53.543
CONTRIVING THE THE THE THE

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:54.611
SELECTION PROCESS.

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.012
FOR BUSY ADMINISTERING THE

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:56.880
SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.148
COMMISSIONERS IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.349
LESS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE YOU DON'T

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:01.084
HAVE TO CONVENE A BRAND NEW BODY

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.219
TO DO THAT.

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:04.988
AND SO WHERE WHERE WE'RE BECAUSE

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.456
THERE WERE CONCERNS IN YOUR

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.824
COUNTERPART COMMITTEE OVER ON

00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.759
THE SENATE SIDE THAT THAT --

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.194
THIS MAY BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.163
SMALLER COUNTIES WE'VE FOCUSED

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.231
ON THE LARGER COUNTIES --

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.565
WHETHER BE LESS OF AN IMPACT

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:16.967
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MUCH BIGGER

00:52:17.033 --> 00:52:18.835
BUDGETS AND THE TOTAL COST.

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.871
EYES WITH AN ESTIMATE TO BE A

00:52:20.937 --> 00:52:22.339
LITTLE LESS TO A THOUSAND WITH

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:23.139
THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT SENATOR

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.107
AND THE CONCERN.

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:25.609
THAT I HAVE IT AS FAR AS BEING

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.277
ABLE TO HAVE THE PROCESS AT THE

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:28.545
LOCAL LEVEL WITH THE COUNTIES

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:29.913
BEING ABLE TO AGENDA IS IT HAVE

THIS AREA I DON'T AGREE WITH

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:37.821

WHERE THE BILL IS HEADED I JUST

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.324
THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE MORE.

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.792
INPUT FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL MOM

00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:44.094

FOR THIS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THEY

HAVE TO HAVE FIVE HEARINGS OVER

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.605
THE PUBLIC THERE'S A IS A VERY

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:57.140

PRODUCE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.252

DIVERSION OF PROPERTY TAXES

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.222

AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR I

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:42.291
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.060
MECHANISM FOR A GENERAL FUND

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.461
BACK FILL OF THOSE PROPERTY

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:47.763

THE SHORT TERM.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:52.001
WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THAT

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:53.736
THAT MECHANISM ITSELF MAKES

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.339
EDUCATION -- MORE RELIABLE ON

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:57.840
THE VOLATILE GENERAL FUND OVER

THE LONGER TERM THAT RELATIVELY

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.711
STABLE PROPERTY TAXES AS AN

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:03.646
EXAMPLE OF THE RISK -- DURING

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.148
THE GREAT RECESSION OF THE LAST

IT'S NOT NECESSARY BUT MORE

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.031
IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT IT ALSO

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.733
DOES NOT PROVIDE THE SAME TYPE

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.334
OF PROTECTIONS THAT EXIST IN

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.236

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.410
BE A A REAL DEFICIENCY OF THE

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.479

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:04.980
DESIRABLE TO THE A IS IS THE

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.682
SAME THING THAT MAKES IT

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:07.249
IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO

PROTECT.

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:09.384

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.824
PRODUCTIVE PART OF OUR WORKING

OF THE STANDOFF MILE W. OF THAT

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.529
SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.397
THAT WE HAVE WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:23.365
ELIMINATION OF OUR WORKING

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.267
WATERFRONT OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW

THAT CARGO -- WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.305
THAT AS THE STATE MOVES FORWARD

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:31.940
WITH AYE IF THESE -- THEY DO IN

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.175
A WAY WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.778
SB -- SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:36.345
HOLLINGS WAS PASSED SEVERAL

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:37.513
YEARS AGO.

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.515
THAT REQUIRES THE STATE LANDS

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.750
COMMISSION AND THE SEAPORT TO

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.485
WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE.

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:44.953
THAT PROVISIONS MOVING FORWARD

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.321
IN AN I FD PROCESS ARE

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.389
CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:48.824
DEPARTMENT'S TRUST.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.259
THIS AVOIDS THAT PROCESS

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.527
UNNECESSARILY.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.061
IT WAS THE CITY COUNCIL IN

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:56.231
CONTROL OF STATE PROPERTY --

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.801
WHICH IS IMPROPER AND

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.969
INCONSISTENT WITH THE TRUST --

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:03.038
AND SO IT DOESN'T MEAN FAN THOSE

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.606
PROTECTIONS IN CURRENT LAW.

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:06.575

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.488
DIFFERENT REASONS.

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:20.756

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.357
WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE WITH ME

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.092
TODAY JUST REALLY BRIEFLY

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.761
MEMBERS WE ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.629
INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS --

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:28.730
IT SHOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:31.333
VOTE BEFORE BONDS CAN BE ISSUED --

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.768
I HAVE TIAS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR

OVER THIRTY YEARS IN STATUTE AND

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:35.871
THEY'VE ALWAYS REQUIRED A TWO

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:37.606
THIRDS VOTE AND WE BELIEVE THAT

01:14:37.673 --> 01:14:40.008
SHOULD REMAINING IN PLACE -- FOR

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.476
THE SIMPLE REASON THAT LONG TERM

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:42.344
DEBT THAT'S GOING TO BE ON

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:45.180
PROPERTY TAX ROLLS FOR DECADES --

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:46.782
INCLUDING TAX INCREMENT SHOULD

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.117
REQUIRE A HIGHER VOTER THRESHOLD

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.285
AND THAT'S ALSO BECAUSE I IF

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.620
HE'S ARE TRADITIONALLY NOT

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.288
BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.490
CREDIT OF A LOCAL GENERAL FUND.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.158
THAT'S INCREASING RISK FOR BOTH

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.560
BOND HOLDERS AND TAXPAYERS AGAIN

01:14:58.627 --> 01:14:59.394
ALL THE MORE REASON WHY YOU'D

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:02.164
WANT -- BROADER LOCAL SUPPORT

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.600

MAKES IT CLEAR THIS IS SIMPLY

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.124
NOT THE CASE.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.592
THERE DEVELOPMENT WILL REQUIRE

AND SIGNIFICANT COST TO OAKLAND.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.957

SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC DELAYS.

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:11.126
THAT WILL HINDER.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:12.694
THE CONTINUED FUNCTIONALITY OF

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.596

THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT DEAL PURE

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.606

VALUABLE REAL ESTATE AND LUXURY

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:01.476

THRESHOLD COULD YOU EXPLAIN A

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:02.624
LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.594
I AM CERTAINLY THIS IS -- IT

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:06.895

PASSED THE PROTEST LANGUAGE ONLY

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:23.812
REQUIRES A 25% TO FILE AND THEN

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:27.549
IT DOES GO TO THE BALLOT -- THIS.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:30.151
THIS WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST.

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.854
