THIS YEAR WE WILL AGAIN BE COMPLYING. WITH ALL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS ARISING OUT OF THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. NO LAST WEEK CALIFORNIA HAS. WAS HOME TO THE LOWEST SEVENTY POSITIVELY RIGHT OF A COVER NINETEEN HOURS IN THIS COUNTRY STATEWIDE ALMOST TWELVE MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FULLY FASCINATED AND CLOSE TO SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOLKS HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY VACCINATED AS OF APRIL TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REPRESENTS OVER 57% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. YOUR CASE WILL COVER NINETEEN HOURS ARE AVERAGING AROUND. TWO THOUSAND AS OPPOSED TO A PEAK OF FORTY THOUSAND CASES A DAY LAST. WINTER DOES TO RECOVER NINETEEN ARE AVERAGING UNDER ONE HUNDRED AS OPPOSED TO A DAILY HIGH OF CLOSE TO SIX HUNDRED DEATHS. A DAY OF THE HIGHEST PART OF THE SEARCH. LAST MONTH THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED JUNE FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE TARGET TO FULLY REOPENING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. IF CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUE GET VACCINATED AND HOSPITALIZATIONS REMAIN LOW THE STATE IS ON COURSE TO MEET THAT DATE. AS OF TODAY NOT A SINGLE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE STATE'S MOST RESTRICTIVE WASH FOR TIER AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE COUNTIES ARE THE MODERATE OR MINIMAL HERE NOW. THESE NUMBERS ARE WELCOME NEWS ESPECIALLY THOSE HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES PANDEMIC FOR WELL OVER A YEAR NOW. OVERALL THE OUTLOOK IS BRIGHT BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET OUR GUARD DOWN. AS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE THE DEPARTMENT IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. MOST OF WHOM ARE SENT TO WORKERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE LUXURY OF WORKING FROM HOME. THESE FOLKS NOT ONLY ARE GREAT RISK CONTRACTING THE VIRUS. BUT THEY OFTEN HUNDRED BALANCE CHILDCARE AND DISTANCE LEARNING ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT IN THE CENTRA JOBS. IN MANY INSTANCES THE GREATEST REST OF COMMUNITIES IN THE DISASTER OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TO REACH WITH HELP. THIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND MAKE PROVIDING AN EQUITABLE RESPONSE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING. TODAY WE WILL HAVE AN INCREDIBLE PANEL TALK WITH THESE CHALLENGES. ON OUR FIRST PANEL WE WILL HEAR FROM CHIEF DARYL OSBY THE LOSS ON COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT.

THANK YOU FOR TODAY'S HEARINGS UNTIL THE END THANK FOR TRANSPARENT AND PLEASE HOLD AND QUESTION TO THEM. WITHOUT THE STRICKEN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL- CHIEF OSBY LIKE TO BEGIN. WELL GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER FREDDIE RODRIGUEZ AND THE HELLO. MY NAME WITH THEIR ALLOWS THE FARCICAL BOSTON IS COMING FOR AN APARTMENT. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. AND ALSO- SHARE MY THOUGHTS- IN RELATION TO THE- MAKE AVAILABLE IN ADDITION TO THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS BOB FIRST OF ALL IF YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF ALL SANDERS IS THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OVER TEN MILLION PEOPLE. FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE AN ALL RISK ORGANIZATION ALONG- WE ARE INVOLVED IN OGDENSBURG DISEASE EXCEPT I SOMETIMES SAY SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE REQUIRE CONST LOS LAW ENFORCEMENT SO EARLY ON- BLOSSOMS COMING APART APARTMENT PARTNERED. WITH THE- PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH HERE LAWSUIT CAN- WE GAVE AND ME. MISTER MANAGEMENT TEAM TO HELP WITH THE INITIALLOGISTICS OF THE PANDEMIC ABOUT OPERATION ROOM KEY. DETAILS ABOUT OUR SERVICES. ARE NEEDED THE FIRST THIRTY. TEST SITES BECOME BOSTON. AND HAD LATER COLLAPSE WITH- PUBLIC HEALTH TWO SEVEN PARTS IN BLIGHTED SET UP FIVE. OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES IN LA CITY HAVE THEIR MAJOR PART OF LOT OF A GARCIA WHO ANOTHER PARTS OF THE FOREST SERVICE. MCCARTY AND THIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA- MEDICARE- COLLABORATION SUPPORT AS IT RELATES TO. A PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND COVERED BY TAKING. OUT I KNOW THAT. I WERE TRYING TO TRANSITION OUT OF THE- THAT'S NATION PROCESS I BELIEVE CARRY FIRE BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING A FOR A WHILE AND FOR SEASON AND BECAME THE LIFE GUARDS. IT'S A STEP IN THE BUT THAT'S MY AND OF IT THE PART ONLY PARTNER. WITH OUR HEALTH APART IN HEALTH AGENCIES WE GAVE ONE MILLION OF HERE. LOS ANGELES CA TO. OUR CITIES. AS YOU KNOW IS A NORMAL- MY ORGANIZATION WE ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE INITIATIVES. ABOUT WE TRY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TO OUR NEEDIEST COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. BECAUSE TYPICALLY THOSE ARE BUSIEST COMMUNITIES AS IT RELATES TO OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES MISSION OUR PARAMEDICS SO THE SAME THING A CURRENT WHEN WE PARTNER WITH OUR PUBLIC. HEALTH AGENCY THAT WE ASSURED ME THAT- WE PUT PARTS IN SOME OF OUR NEEDIEST COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT- THOSE. OPPORTUNITIES GOT THE SERVICES THEY NEED IT FROM SUPPLIES TO. ALL TESTING INTO LATER VACCINE I WORKED WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH. ALL THE LAWSUIT IS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ALSO MY COUNTERPART OF BARBER FOR RARE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH WITHIN. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM I THINK THAT WE OVERALL DID WELL AS THE INCIDENT AND I'LL I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS. SAVE SOME OF. THE QUESTIONS THAT OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK. BUT AS ANY- INSTEAD OF HAD A THE CAREER AND I AND IT IS PREVENT FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. I'M THERE'S ALWAYS LESSONS IN TO WOULD BE FINE AND I THINK. WALKING FROM ACCOUNTING EXPERTS WITH COUNTY AGENTS. AS WE HAD STONE WE WERE TO. RESOLVE THOSE TALENTS AND EXPERTISE MANNER- YEAH BEEN SOME INSTANCES THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE T. THE EX OF FOR THE STATE. BUT I THINK THAT IN SOME INSTANCES FROM- YES OF M. SORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I WE COULD COLLABORATE A LITTLE BIT BETTER- EDUCATION TO COMMUNICATIONS BOB AS WE SOMETIMES SAY IT'S AN EMERGENCY INCIDENTS THAT ALL PARTIES ARE LOCAL AND THEN HE SPED OUT TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES FOR ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THEY'RE IN SOME AREAS ALTHOUGH A VERY. OBJECTIVE WAS WORLD INTENDED BECAUSE DONE WELL AS FAR AS COORDINATION- OVERALL PROJECT WAS TO GET SHOTS OF PEOPLE'S ARMS AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT THE LAST THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY- TO THE CONDO- IS. I MEAN WE IS FOR. AND FROM MY BUDGET THE SOLAR CHOSEN SURE EVERYONE BELT BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE. IT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE GET. OF RAMPARTS BUT SINCE I KNEW THAT LIVES WERE AT STAKE- I PUT THAT ON THE BACK BURNER BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF GETTING REAL. BURST OUT THROUGH. OF FAME- OR THE COUNTY OR THE STATE AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF OUR OWN COMMITMENTS ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY BEFORE I. AM THIS IS THERE I WE WORK VERY WELL WITH CAL POLY HAS. AS IT RELATES TO PRE POSITIONING FUNDING- THE GOVERNOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO. UP AWARDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OR FOR FUNDING INITIALLY FOR OUR WELLNESS SAID. BUT REALLY THAT. FUNDING IS FOR- ALL RISK FACTOR. IN SO WE'VE USED FUNDING. A WALL FIRE HIM AN FLOODS. ARE WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT CAN MAKING A CURRENT BUT- WE WERE ON A TO USE THE FUND FOR. AND I THINK THAT OF THE LESSON LEARNED WITH THAT THEY ABOUT. YOU KNOW TO HELP MORE DIAL TO TALK ABOUT LEARNED IT. WHAT WE DO WELCOME CAN DO TO IMPROVE. AND ALSO TO. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE STATE ALLOCATES TO ALWAYS ASK FOR PRE POSITIONING. FOR ALL FROM ALL RISK IS THIS REALLY. A DROP IN THE BUCKET. YEAH I THAT. AWFULLY THIS CALL. OTHERS THAT WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER JOB IN RELATION TO THE- PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO ALL WE ASK FOR A STATE MISSIONS. ARE WE LOOK AT THE CHILE FROM A FARMER'S PERSPECTIVE- OVER 56% ALMOST SIX PERCENT. OF RESOURCES FOR MUTUAL EIGHT. COME FROM LOCAL RESOURCES PROCESS ABOUT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THEIR- RESPONSES AND I THINK THAT. THERE'S NO NUMBERS THERE'S NO DATA YET. IN RELATION TO THE COMMITMENT. THAT WAS GIVEN BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. A FOR THESE MISSIONS I THINK THAT. HELLO IS ONE OF THE ACCOMPLICE BEGIN ADDITIONAL FIVE. OF THE WITHIN THE MICRO RIGHT NOW IT WILL HAVE WITHIN. GIVEN HOW LONG I COULD. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD TELL ME THAT B. O. THEY BROKE OTHERS SPEAKERS AT FOLLOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M VERY MUCH OF ALL OF THE- NEXT WILL HAVE. A ME SESSION HOPEFULLY PROFESSOR FROM THE ALL PARMER THE PUBLIC. CARE WHEN YOU'RE A ANY. YEAH COULD COULD MORE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HEAR. OKAY WELL THANK YOU FOR THE UP TO PROVIDE THE PERSPECTIVE OF A SMALL LOCAL APARTMENT REGARDING THE ROLL OUT OF CODE NINETEEN VACCINES AND OTHERS HEALTH OFFICER FOR YOLO COUNTY I'VE GUIDED OUR COUNTIES COVERT NINETEEN pVACCINE ROLLOUT. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE I FIRST TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IN EARLY FEBRUARY I AM PLEASED TO REPORT. THAT OUT OF SUNDAY RESIDENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE AND ARE FULLY VACCINATED. A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOSES HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED IN OUR COUNTY OF TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. YOUR COUNTIES HELP DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AS ADMINISTERED OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOSES. WELL THE COUNTY ITSELF HAS GIVEN MORE DOSES TO COUNTY RESIDENTS THAN ANY OTHER VACCINE PROVIDER WE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN 2408% OF RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF MANY PROVIDERS INCLUDING CHAIN PHARMACIES FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS FIRE DEPARTMENT AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES PERSONNEL UC DAVIS AND A CITY UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP KNOWN AS THE DAVIS TOGETHER. TO DATE YOUR COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO VACCINATION HAS BEEN A HYBRID OF MASS VACCINATION A DRIVE THROUGH CLINICS AND MORE FOCUSED MOBILE OUTREACH. HOWEVER EVEN OUR MASTER ACTIVATION SITES OR MOBILE THESE CLINICS ROTATE FOR SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTY TO PROVIDE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD PRIMARILY IN OUR THREE LARGEST CITIES OF WOODLAND WEST SACRAMENTO AND DAVIS. MATHIS VACCINATION IN A SMALL COUNTY LIKE YOLO MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN L. A. COUNTY WE CONSIDER ANYTHING WITH THREE HUNDRED OR MORE DOSES PER DAY TO BE A MASS VACCINATION CLINIC. INITIALLY WE USED EVENTBRITE PUBLIC LINKS FOR SIGN UPS THAT MASS VACCINATION SITES BUT WE MIGRATED TO THE MY TURN PLATFORM RECENTLY AS REQUIRED BY THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR ITS NEW TP A NETWORK ONCE THE SYSTEM HAD THE FUNCTIONALITY WE NEEDED. WE RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THAT WE NEEDED ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO REACH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HARDER TO REACH POPULATIONS. WE WORK WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO WOULD NEED SUCH NEED MORE SUPPORT AND THEN SATISFIED DOSES FOR MEMBERS OF THESE GROUPS AT MATH VACCINATION CLINICS USING PRIVATE EVENTBRITE LINKS. PHONE NUMBERS WERE PROVIDED TO SUPPORT THOSE WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS OR LIMITED DIGITAL LITERACY. WE OFFER DEDICATED VACCINE EVENTS FOR CERTAIN GROUPS USUALLY OUT OF FAMILIAR SIGHT AND SOMETIMES WITH INCENTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE ONE CLINIC FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS WAS ADVERTISED BY FIRST FIVE HELD AT THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND OFFERED FREE DIAPERS AND OTHER GIVEAWAYS. WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH TWO ONE ONE TO SIGN UP THOSE WHO NEEDED A VACCINE IN THEIR HOME AND WORKED WITH AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE THESE IN HOME VACCINATIONS. HELLO COUNTY HAS A SUBSTANTIAL FARMWORKER POPULATION WHO ARE PRIMARILY LATINO. WE SURVEYED FARM BUSINESSES REGARDING HOW MANY EMPLOYEES WANTED VACCINES AND THEN SCHEDULED THESE EMPLOYEES INTO VACCINE CLINICS HELD ON THE FARMS THEMSELVES. THANKS TO THESE EFFORTS WE ESTIMATE THAT COUNTY HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. YET DESPITE THESE CONCERTED EFFORTS TOWARDS BACKING UP WITH THE VACCINE IN EQUITY IS PERSISTENT YOLO COUNTY. NEARLY ANY WAY YOU SLICE THE DATA CERTAIN GROUPS HAVE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF VACCINATED PERSONS THAN OTHERS. THE DISPARITIES ARE PARTICULARLY VISIBLE BY ETHNICITY AND BY ZIP CODE. YOLO COUNTY'S MOST DISADVANTAGED APPROACH I'VE MEASURED BY THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX IS NINE FIVE SIX OH FIVE IN WEST SACRAMENTO. COMPARED TO THE COUNTY AVERAGE OF 48% OF RESIDENTS AT LEAST PARTIALLY VACCINATED ONLY 29% OF RESIDENTS AND NINE FIVE SIX OH FIVE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. BECAUSE OF THIS GAP ARE MULTIFACTORIAL AND INCLUDE TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS LANGUAGE BARRIERS IN SPANISH AND RUSSIAN SPEAKING POPULATIONS AND BAXEEN HESITANCY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS. WE HAVE RESPONDED FOR THE DISPARITIES BY HOLDING VACCINE CLINICS IN NINE FIVE SIX OH FIVE DEDICATED TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK AND THE ZIP CODE. WE PARTNER WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO SIGN UP INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS AND TO PROVIDE LANGUAGE SERVICES AT THE CLINICS. JUST OUTSIDE OF NINE pVACCINATION SITE IS OPEN FOR THOSE WITH APPOINTMENTS AND FOR WALK INS. FREE TRANSPORTATION IS AVAILABLE TO THE SITE. FOR NOW EXPLORING INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATION. ONE LESSON LEARNED FROM OUR EFFORTS IN WEST SACRAMENTO IS THAT WE ARE NOT BUILDING A FIELD OF DREAMS IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS IF YOU BUILD IT A. K. A. VACCINE. THEY WILL COME. ACCESS TO VACCINE IS JUST ONE PIECE OF A COMPLEX PUZZLE. AN ADDITIONAL FORM OF VACCINE IN EQUITY IN YOLO COUNTY IS UNDER VACCINATION OF LATINOS. MARTINO'S COMPRISE 32% OF PEOPLE COUNTY RESIDENTS BUT ONLY 18% OF YOUR COUNTY RESIDENTS VACCINATED TO DATE. THIS DISPARITY IS DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO POOR DATA. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S BAXEEN DASHBOARD NEARLY 15% OF THOSE VACCINATED AND YOU'LL COUNTY TODAY ARE OF UNKNOWN ETHNICITY. IN SOME CASES YOUR COUNTY ACTUALLY HOUSE A NECESSITY DATA ON THESE UNKNOWN PERSONS BUT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE STATE'S IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY UPDATED. USING YOLO IS IMPROVED DATA ONLY 6% OF THOSE VACCINATED ARE MISTING ETHNICITY COMPARED TO THE 15% REPORTED AS UNKNOWN BY THE STATE. INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF LATINO VACCINIA IS FROM 18% TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. WHILE IMPROVED WE STILL FALL SHORT OF THE 32% LATINO POPULATION PROPORTION. YOUR COUNTY IS NOW FUNDING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS TRUSTED MESSENGERS TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATION AMONG LATINOS. WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO MAKE VACCINES MORE CONVENIENT RECOGNIZING THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE VACCINATED BUT THEY WON'T TURN DOWN A VACCINE THAT LANDS IN THEIR LAPS. IN THE COMING WEEKS WILL BE OFFERING VACCINE AT CATHOLIC CHURCHES LATINO GROCERY STORES. OF WORKPLACES AND SCHOOLS AS WELL AS AFTER WORK AND ON WEEKENDS. I REMAIN CRITICAL OF STATE LEVEL APPROACHES TO IMPROVE TIMELY ACCESS TO VACCINES PARTICULARLY MY TURN AT THE T. PA NETWORK. BOTH WERE WELL INTENTIONED BUT THEY ARRIVED ON THE SCENE TOO LATE TO SOLVE FOR WHICH THEY WERE CREATED. THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY ANYONE'S FAULT. IT SIMPLY DIFFICULT FOR LARGE ENTITIES TO PIVOT AS SITUATIONS CHANGE WHEREAS SMALLER ENTITIES CAN BE MORE NIMBLE. FOR EXAMPLE BY THE TIME MY TURN WAS TECHNICALLY ABLE TO LIMIT REGISTRATIONS BY COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AND STATE POLICY ENABLED SUCH GEO FENCING IN ORDER TO RESTRICT VACCINE FOR ISLAM MANY COUNTIES USING MY TURN HAD SEEN A DECREASE AND DEMANDS. THEY ENDED UP USING THE GEO FENCING FEATURE FOR ONLY A SHORT TIME BEFORE OPENING VACCINES TO ALL. THE VACCINE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES CHANGES QUICKLY AND LARGE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS JUST CAN'T KEEP UP AS WE MOVE FROM VACCINE SCARCITY TO VACCINE HESITANCY WITHIN JUST A FEW WEEKS FIVE. THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF THE TP A NETWORK DEVELOPED TO IMPROVE VACCINE EFFICIENCY AND EXPAND VACCINATION CAPACITY IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THE TP A NETWORK HAS DONE LITTLE TO EXPAND YOLO COUNTY VACCINATION CAPACITY IN ROLLING FEW NEW PROVIDERS AND HAS CERTAINLY NOT IMPROVED EFFICIENCY. I NOW SPEND SEVERAL HOURS EACH WEEK COMPLETING SPREADSHEETS AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH BLUE SHIELD REPRESENTATIVES TO REVIEW PROPOSED VACCINE ALLOCATIONS ONLY IN MANY CASES TO FIND THAT THE TPPA DID NOT ALLOCATE THOSE THOSE TO PROVIDERS AS RECOMMENDED. AS THE FDA LOOKS TO AUTHORIZE THE FIVES OF VACCINE FOR ADOLESCENTS TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS OLD I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MOVING AWAY FROM THE TVA NETWORK AND TOWARD AN EXISTING NETWORK OF PROVIDERS. KNOWN AS VACCINES FOR CHILDREN OR VFC PROVIDERS. COMPRISED OF PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN OFFICES VFC PROVIDERS ARE A TRUSTED SOURCE OF INFORMATION VACCINES AND INFORMATION ABOUT VACCINES. RATHER THAN PUSHING ALL THESE EXISTING VFC PROVIDERS ON TO THE NEW TP A NETWORK I ENCOURAGE USE OF THE EXISTING VFC ABOUT WORK AND ADDITIONAL PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS TO VACCINATE YOUNGER CALIFORNIANS IN THE NEXT PHASE OF THE VACCINE ROLLOUT. PSC PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY PARTNERED WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO DELIVER OTHER VACCINES. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCEPT BORDER FIZER SHIPMENTS AND TRANSFER SMALLER NUMBER OF DOSES TO INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS KING OF THE STORE OR USE THE LARGE MINIMUM SHIPMENTS AVAILABLE FROM FIZER FIFTY P. EIGHT DOES NOT HAVE THIS ABILITY. WITH ALL THE FOCUS ON VACCINATION TESTING FOR COVERT NINETEEN HAS FALLEN OFF THE RADAR OF SOMEBODY. YET IT REMAINS A CRITICAL STRATEGY IN CONTROLLING SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. BECAUSE 40% OF COVERT NINETEEN CASES HAVE NO SYMPTOMS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE CONVEYED THIS TO TEST THEM FOR KOBE. ONCE VACCINATED THE NEED FOR TESTING THOSE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS GOES AWAY. BUT CENTS LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD STILL BENEFIT FROM REGULAR COBIT TESTING. EXISTING TESTING SITES ARE UNDER UTILIZED ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN YOLO COUNTY DESPITE TEST BEING FREE AND RESULTS BEING PROVIDED FASTER THAN EVER TYPICALLY ONE DAY AFTER TESTING. SOME TESTING PROVIDERS IN YOLO COUNTY ARE EXPLORING INCENTIVES FOR TESTING INCLUDING A RECENT TESTING EVENT AT A MIGRANT HOUSING CENTER THAT OFFERED FREE TACOS FOR PARTICIPANTS. IN SUMMARY YOUR COUNTY HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN VACCINATING NEARLY HALF OF ITS RESIDENTS WITH AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. HOWEVER THAT'S PROGRESS HAS NOT REACHED ALL RESIDENTS EQUALLY WITH LATINOS AND CERTAIN ZIP CODES BEING LEFT BEHIND. CONCERTED EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO IMPROVE VACCINATION RATES IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THE WORK IS HARD AND PROGRESS SLOW. DESPITE THIS CHALLENGE WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS WORK BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS DEADLY VIRUS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION THIS MORNING. THANK YOU AMY NOW WILL LOOK TO HEAR FROM DR PAUL SIMON FROM LOS SOUNDS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THANK YOU ARE COMMITTEE CHAIR ROD REGUS AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME AGAIN TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT L. A. COUNTY SCOPE AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. INCLUDING THE VITALLY IMPORTANT PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL AND STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES IN SUPPORTING THESE ACTIVITIES. AS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE- WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN COVERT NINETEEN CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS IN L. A. COUNTY IN RECENT WEEKS. OPENS FOR FLOOD THE NUMBER OF FACTORS BUT OF CENTRAL IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN THE CONTINUED COOPERATION AND COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND OTHER PARTNERS INCLUDING OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. AND OTHER COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS OUR STATE COUNTERPARTS. L. A. COUNTY HAS A VAST VACCINE DISTRICT DISTRIBUTION NETWORK WHICH CURRENTLY INCLUDES OVER SEVEN HUNDRED VACCINATION SITES DISPERSED ACROSS THE COUNTY. THIS NETWORK IS SUPPORTED BY PARTNERSHIPS WITH HOSPITALS FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS. OTHER COMMUNITY CLINICS PHARMACIES AND PRIVATE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. PART OF THE NETWORK BUT COUNTY IT'S ALSO BEEN OPERATING BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT MASS VACCINATION SITES SINCE MID JANUARY WITH THE CAPACITY TO VACCINATE 1-800-022-0000 PEOPLE A DAY. I AS CHIEF OSBY MENTIONED- IN TOTAL OVER ONE MILLION VACCINATIONS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED AT THE SITES OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF MONTHS. FOR THESE COUNTY RUN MASS VACCINATION SITES PUBLIC HEALTH SHARES UNIFIED COMMAND WOOD COUNTY FIRE AND OUR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE. THROUGHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP WITH FIRE AND- EM WE HAVE USED A SHARED MANAGEMENT APPROACH. PUBLIC HEALTH IS MAINTAINED THE OVERALL SITE LEADERSHIP OF THESE COUNTY VACCINATION SITES INCLUDING FINANCING FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND COST MANAGEMENT STAFF RECRUITMENT AND SUPERVISION CLINICAL PROTOCOLS AND PROCEDURES BAXEEN MANAGEMENT APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING AND REGISTRATION. BAXEEN RELATED DATA COLLECTION REPORTING AND BAXEEN MESSAGING AND COMMUNICATIONS. HOW THE FIRE HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL PART BEEN A SUPPLIED PHYSICAL SITE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT. AS POSSIBLY MENTIONED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AT EACH OF THESE SITES A QUICK MINTON'S REPLY ORGANIZATION REPLENISHMENT TRAFFIC CONTROL ONSITE FIRE AND AMBULANCE SERVICES CRISIS RESPONSE PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND HAS SERVED AS LIAISON WITH OFF SITE PUBLIC SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. STAKEHOLDERS COUNTY OEM HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERALL MISSION MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION INCLUDING SITE SELECTION LIAISON WITH VENUE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. MOBILIZING BACKS- A MASS VACCINATION SITES HAS BEEN AN IMMENSE EFFORT THAT IS REQUIRED EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TIME AND COORDINATION. THESE SITES HAVE PLAYED AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN GETTING VACCINE OUT QUICKLY WELL BEING SUPPLEMENTED BY MANY OTHER STRATEGIES TO GET VACCINE INTO THE ARMS OF RESIDENTS. WELL VERY EFFECTIVE IN GETTING A LARGE NUMBER OF VACCINATIONS ADMINISTERED EARLY ON WHEN DEMAND FOR VACCINE WAS VERY HIGH. THESE LARGE COUNTY VACCINE SITES WERE LESS EFFECTIVE IN REACHING RESIDENTS IN THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. TRANSPORTATION OTHER ACCESS BARRIERS AT THE SITES. MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THE EARLY INEQUITIES IN VACCINATION RATES IN THE COUNTY THE SUBSTITUTING ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO TARGET TARGET THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD SPECIFIC CLINICS AND OTHER FOCUSED APPROACHES. PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH FIRST RESPONDERS IN OUR WORK WITH MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS L. A. COUNTY AS PART OF OUR MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY TO VACCINATE HOMEBOUND RESIDENTS. SPECIFICALLY WERE WORKING WITH MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO VOLUNTARILY BACKS THE WHOLE BY RESIDENTS IN CITIES JURISDICTIONS. AND USING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO IDENTIFY HOME BOUND RESIDENTS INCLUDING CLIENT. REFERRALS FROM COMMUNITY PARTNERS CITIES AND REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDING SERVICES TO HOMEBOUND RESIDENTS. INDIVISIBLE FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE ALSO GIVEN THE OPTION TO VACCINATE HOMEBOUND INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED BY THEIR TEAM WHILE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDED HOMEBOUND CRITERIA PROVIDED BY PUBLIC HEALTH. PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO ALLOCATING VACCINES TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE L. A. COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO REACH HOME BOUND INDIVIDUALS THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY FOUR. THANKS TO THESE MANY PARTNERSHIPS AND OTHER IMPORTANT STRATEGIES TO DATE WE HAVE ADMINISTERED MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION TOTAL DOSES OF VACCINE L. A. COUNTY. WITH ABOUT FIVE MILLION FIRST DOSES AND THREE MILLION SECOND DOSES. UNFORTUNATELY JUSTICE IN YOLO COUNTY WE CONTINUE TO SEE LARGE DISPARITIES IN VACCINATION RATES ACROSS THE COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME OF OUR MOST AFFLUENT CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. MORE THAN 60% OF THOSE SIXTEEN AND OLDER RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. WELL IN SOME OF OUR LEAST AFFLUENT CITIES LESS THAN DOSES. SIMILARLY WE CONTINUE TO SEE LARGE DISPARITIES IN VACCINATION RATES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WITH THE HIGHEST RATES AMONG WHITES AND ASIANS AND THE LOWEST RATES AMONG LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. WE ALSO SEE HIGHER VACCINATION RATES AMONG WOMEN THAN MEN. WE HAVE SEEN SOME PROGRESS IN REDUCING THESE INEQUITIES FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. WHO HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY AMONG BLACK LATINO AND AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE RESIDENTS THAN AMONG WHITES AND ASIANS. HOWEVER MUCH MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CLOSE THESE UNACCEPTABLE GAPS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO INCREASING THE VACCINE DOSES ALLOCATED TO THE HARDEST HIT ZIP CODES IN L. A. COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE STEADILY INCREASED THE ALLOCATION OF VACCINE DOSES. TO OUR NETWORK PROVIDERS LOCATED IN THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES WITH NEARLY 75% OF THOSE IS NOW GOING TO THESE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION TO ALLOATING CLOSEST TO PROVIDERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES MOBILE OF ACCIDENT VACCINATION TEAMS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING DEPLOYED. TO THESE HIGH NEED AREAS FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TEMPORARY VACCINATION SITES WILL BE ESTABLISHED. BY THESE TEAMS THAT SENIOR HOUSING SITES SENIOR CENTERS HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THESE AREAS. CAN I SIT REACHING THE REMAINING POPULATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN VACCINATED WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING GIVEN THE RELUCTANCE OF MANY TO BE VACCINATED. THEREFORE WE LOOK TO IMPLEMENT TARGETED STRATEGIES TO CONTINUE IMPROVING OUR OVERALL UP ACTION AND APPROXIMATION RATES WITH THESE GROUPS INCLUDING PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. PARTNERING WITH NONPROFITS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO SERVICE VACCINATION SITES AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MAKING APPOINTMENTS IN PROVIDING PATIENT EDUCATION. OFFERING DIFFERENT POINTS OF VACCINE ACCESS INCLUDING CLOSED VACCINE DISPENSING SITES FOR THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES AND FOR ELIGIBLE ESSENTIAL WORKERS MOBILE VACCINATION CLINICS. OFFERING WALK UP SITES AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES WITHOUT APPOINTMENTS NEEDED FOR OLDER ADULTS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THOSE WHO ARE HOME BOUND AS WELL AS- OTHER. RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN HARD HIT COMMUNITIES. THE PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN VACCINATION DEMAND IN RECENT DAYS HAS ALL HAS ALSO IMPACTED THE COUNTY PARK OPERATIONS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO PLAN FOR STAFFING. NEEDED VACCINE SUPPLIES FOOTPRINT REDUCTIONS AND OTHER OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES DECREASED DEMAND HAS REQUIRED US TO IMPLEMENT. NO APPOINTMENT NEEDED APPROACH AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WHICH MAKES SITE STAFF AND RESOURCE PLANNING MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST THE STATE'S SUPPORT OF A MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATION PROGRAM AND SUPPLY OF CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL STAFFING FOR THE BEST VACCINATION SITES HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS MISSION AND WE ENCOURAGE CONTINUED SUPPORT IN THIS AREA. THE STATE'S VACCINE APPOINTMENT AND REGISTRATIONS CORRECT REGISTRATION SYSTEM. ARE HAS DOCTORS THIS MANSION HAS REMAINED A CHALLENGE LOCAL STAFF OF HAD TO DEVELOP NUMEROUS WORKAROUNDS TO OVERCOME DATA SYSTEM A LIST OF THE MEDICATIONS. WHICH ARE DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES IN THE COUNTY. HOWEVER WE DO APPRECIATE THE STATE'S EFFORTS IN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. AND THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED ENHANCEMENTS OF THE SYSTEM. WE ALSO MUCH APPRECIATE INCREASED WE WILL ALSO MUCH APPRECIATE INCREASED COORDINATION WITH CAL- E. S. AND FEDERAL PARTNERS UNDER VACCINATION EFFORTS IN OUR JURISDICTION. AS UP- AS- RECTOR HOUSE BE MENTIONED- WE BELIEVE THAT- WELL WE WERE READY PROJECT THE OP THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE FEDERAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY AND SUPPORTING OUR VACCINATION EFFORTS WE DO FEEL THAT WE ARE COULD HAVE BEEN THAT COULD BE IN THE FUTURE MORE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE WITH INCREASED COORDINATION. ON CBO'S AND FAITH BASED A PARTNER SENIOR CENTER IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITES AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN REACHING HARD HIT POPULATIONS FUNDING FOR THESE PARK- PARTNERS EVEN SMALL STIPEND AMOUNTS WOULD ASSIST IN HAVING BROADER REACH FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE INVESTING STAFF. TIME FOR INVESTING STAFF TIME SPACE OUR REGION OTHER RESOURCES TO MOBILIZE THEIR CONSTITUENCIES TO CONTACTS NATION SITES TO ASSIST OUR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT RESIDENTS WE WOULD WELCOME SUPPORT FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS WHICH CREDIT WHICH IS CRITICAL. FOR MOBILE VACCINATION EFFORTS. FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT WILL HELP A. COUNTY IN THE STATE ARE CURRENTLY IN A RELATIVELY GOOD PLACE WITH REGARD TO THE PANDEMIC VACCINATION EFFORTS WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WE REMAIN VULNERABLE. WE KNOW THAT CASE NUMBERS ARE RISING IN SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING STATES. AND WE DO NOT YET HAVE SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE VACCINATED TO PREVENT FURTHER COMMUNITY SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. AND SUSTAINING SUSTAINING OUR VACCINATION EFFORTS REMAINS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED COLLABORATION WITH EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE OUR VACCINATION GOALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PAUL. AND NOW LAST FROM OUR FIRST PANEL WILL HAVE. A SHAUN ROGOFF DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FOR GLOBAL MEDICAL RESPONSE. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO THIS MANY- AGAIN MY NAME IS GYRO AFTER AFTER SPECIAL OPERATIONS FOR GMR- I'VE BEEN WORKING AS- THE INCIDENT COMMANDER FOR JIM MARRS COBA NINETEEN RESPONSE SINCE LAST MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY- GMR IN A. M. ARE. AT ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. TO INCLUDE CONTRACTED SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA AND STUFF ARE ALL PATIENT TRANSFERS WILL GROUND AN ERROR WITHIN THE STATE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH HELLO YES BOTH IN THE FIELD AND EMBEDDED. IN THE STATE COMMAND CENTER. WE HAVE WORKED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE VACCINATION SIDE SUPPORTS NDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT WE HAVE THAT BUT MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES. ADULT TRAINING TO BECOME TRAINED INOCULATE YOURS- WHICH IS A SPECIAL SKILL SET FOR BOTH FOR BOTH PARAMEDICS AND EMTS I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A QUICK REVIEW. OF SOME OF OUR AREAS OF SUPPORT WITHIN THE STATE. I IMPERIAL COUNTY. WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING TWELVE LOCAL VACCINATION SITES SINCE FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR I WOULD SEVENTY TWO EMPLOYEES. ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND WE PROVIDED UP TO- NINE THOUSAND VACCINATIONS TO DATE. IN VENTURA COUNTY. MARCH AS IN WITH FIFTEEN PERSONNEL MANNING THREE SITES TO IN OXNARD TO IN CAMERA RIO AND ONE IN SANTA PAULA. IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY I WE'VE HAD THREE PARAMEDIC INOCULATED IS WORKING AND RANCHO CUCAMONGA WE'VE HAD TO AND REDLANDS AND MAKE THAT TO WORKING IN A CLINIC IN VICTORVILLE- WE'VE HAD TO DO AT THE COUNTY SUPERSITE I'M WORKING AS AN ARTICULATORS. WE'VE ALSO HAD PARAMEDICS ON STANDBY ON THE BACKS AND ASIAN SIDE AT ST MARY'S HOSPITAL. I IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS SALUS STAND BY UNITS. OF MANY DIFFERENT VACCINATION SITES. BY OUR FIRST DATE IN SUPPORT OF DURING THE INOCULATIONS. IN CINEMA COUNTY. WE'VE HAD TWENTY FIVE G. OF OUR EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN ASSISTING IN VACCINATING UP TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. IN SACRAMENTO AND THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION. NOW WE'VE SUPPORTED VACCINATION CLINICS AND THE LOS RIOS SCHOOL DISTRICT- AND YOLO COUNTY WE'VE ACTUALLY STARTED VERY EARLY SUPPORT IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN PRESENT AT ALL THE EAGLE COUNTY VACCINATION CLINICS AS WELL AS PROVIDING VACCINATIONS SUPPORT FOR PRIVATE FARMS ARE FOR HIGH SCHOOLS IN WEST SACRAMENTO AND YOLO. AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR HOME BACKS NATION'S FOR THOSE WHO COULDN'T- COULDN'T MAKE THEIR WAY TO AN ACTUAL INOCULATION SITE. I'LL PROBABLY ARE OUR BIGGEST SUPPORT EFFORT TO DATE HAS BEEN IN OAKLAND AT THE OAKLAND COLISEUM. SUPERSITE THE VACCINATION SITE THERE I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT OPERATION AND MID FEBRUARY AND WE ARE STILL CURRENTLY SUPPORTING IT. THAT ENERGY OF FORTY TO FIFTY EMPLOYEES AT THAT LOCATION. EVERY DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK I HAD AND TO DATE. THE SYSTEM PROVIDING OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND- VACCINATIONS TO THEIR COMMUNITY- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE BIGGER AREAS I THINK WHERE WE'VE BEEN SUPPORTING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY- CHANGE FOR ME ARE SAN DIEGO ALONG WITH VOLUNTEERS. FROM THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF SAN DIEGO IN THE LATINO EQUITY COUNCIL I HAVE GONE DOOR TO DOOR MARIO LITTLE BIT. TO HELP INFORM RESIDENTS ABOUT THE VACCINE- AND GET THEM SIGNED UP FOR APPOINTMENTS. OUR TEAM TO PARTICIPATED IN OPERATION COLLABORATION. WHICH IS AN EFFORT AIMED TO GETTING THE VACCINE HOW INTEGRAL COMMUNITIES. AND IN ADDITION. TO OPERATING TO FIX SITES IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA.

THERE'S BEEN CHALLENGES AND CIVIL BASS TO MANY OF THE- BUT STATE ARE AND- LOCAL AGENCIES AS IT RELATES TO THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE THE PARAMEDICS AND I THINK.

THANK GOOD MORNING THIS IS A QUESTION FOR CHEAP OSBI ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. MORNING CHIEF HOW ARE YOU. THE MORNING GOING GREAT THANK YOU. EIGHT SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS WHEN DID. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GET APPROACHED TO START THE LOGISTICS PROCESS- BECAUSE EARLY ON THIS IS JUST KIND OF A NIGHTMARE. AND THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT WHY DON'T WE LET THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO LOGISTICS BEST. ASSISTANCE IN THIS AND MIKE I'M KIND OF CURIOUS WHEN WE STARTED WHEN YOU GUYS GOT INVOLVED WHEN THEY APPROACHED YOU- AS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT- TO GET INVOLVED IN THE LOGISTICAL- PART OF THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF LOS GATOS COUNTY AND MARK. COUNTERPART OF PUBLIC HEALTH DONALD REGARDING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE PACIFIC LEVEL. I'M WE DISCUSSED THE DYNAMICS OF THE LOGISTICS OF SUPPLIES PROVISION TIRE COUNTY. AND I ADVISED OF MY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL OR DIRECTOR PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WE HAVE THE SKILL SETS TO RUN THE- JUST SIX WORTH APPLYING GOING TO. WORK OUT NICK NEEDED ASSISTANCE ALSO PROVIDENCE REPEAT MAP ALL THE MONSTERS COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. OR HARDWARE BLOOD BEACH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WE RAN THE ADDITIONAL MAJESTIC'S OUT OF THE LONG BEACH CONVENTION CENTER AND WE DID THAT AND TELL ON. PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT WERE ABLE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER POINTS- MANAGE THE SYSTEM AND THEN OTHER AGENCIES MANAGE THEIR OWN OTHER SYSTEMS AND SO I THINK IT'S- A SPEAKS TO BE COLLABORATION. AND THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND THOSE THINGS ARE. VITALLY IMPORTANT PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. I'M IS NOT THE BEST- HI IN- PRACTICE TO TRY TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS DON'T HAVE AN INCIDENT STOKE ESSEX THE MESSAGE APPEAR BUT WE WERE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT LEVEL. RIGHT AND WHAT MONTH WAS THAT INCIPIENT LEVEL. WAS AT LAST WAS IT AUGUST LAST. YEAR NUMBER ONE THANK. I'M I'M JUST GUESSING RIGHT NOW. AB LAST MARCH OR APRIL WHEN THERE AS THE CHAIN WITH- BASKET SUPPLY IN GALA. SO DOES ESTIMATES WAS MORE OF LAST YEAR WHEN WE BEGAN TO MAKE INTEL WERE ABLE TO IT BACK OVER TO THE. MY HOTEL IS I AM THAT PART FOCUS I THE VACCINE PART OF THIS. WHEN A DAY GET YOU YOU. STILL HAVE TODAY YOU YES. I'M SORRY YEAH I'M MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION. SO THE DEFINITION PROCESS. ONLY. I'M TRYING TO THINK AMERICA NATIONALLY WE WERE INVOLVED IN THE VACCINES ARM WHEN THERE WAS A CHALLENGE OF SETTING UP MAKE MEGA SCIENCE ROBAXIN UNTIL IT FINALLY CITY SET UP THE FIRST THIRTY SIX THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND THEN WHENEVER THE DAY WELL IT'S THERE ARE WE TRANSITION FROM. VACCINES TO MAKE PROTESTING THE VACCINES THAT'S WHEN WE BEGAN TO CLEAR BUT SINCE I DON'T HAVE ACCURATE DATA PUT IT RIGHT NOW OKAY VACCINES BECAME AVAILABLE WE WERE INVOLVED IN THAT MISSION RIGHT I AND OKAY SO IT IT BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF MY QUESTION OR MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY DIDN'T ENGAGE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO DO LOGISTICS PASSED SOON ENOUGH IN THIS PROCESS WHICH IS WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE VACCINES ON THE HORIZON AS LATE R. AS EARLY AS LAST JULY. THAT'S WHEN THAT PLANNING PROCESS STARTS AND SO I YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TRY TO DO LIKE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIS WHEN YOU TRY TO DO LOGISTICS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIRE EIGHT IT'S PRETTY HECTIC AT THE BEGINNING- IT'S BETTER IF WE HAVEN'T DONE WAY AHEAD OF TIME SO THAT THAT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT- SECOND QUESTION I HAD AND THEN I'LL LET SOME OTHERS ANSWERS ASK SOME QUESTIONS ARE YOU TALK ABOUT PRE POSITIONING IN THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS GIVEN. FOR PRE POSITIONING WHAT KIND OF PRE. IS WAS WITH NO AND HOW MUCH. WHAT IS THE AMOUNT NEEDED TO OFFSET THE AGENCY COSTS JUST FOR L. A. COUNTY ALONE- SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT ALLOCATIONS ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE THOSE FROM THE STATE BUDGET. YEAH SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO- ARAMBULA. REPOSITIONING FUNDS THAT ARE ALLOCATED- YES IT'S TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. I COULDN'T SIT THERE RIGHT NOW AND TELL YOU WHAT. WE SHOULD HAVE I MEAN I THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AS IT RELATES TO. THE WALL AND FIRE RISK AND. RESIDUE AS WE TRANSITION INTO THE- MAY. WHATEVER OF BOSTON CAN AND THEN WAS MODELED ON THE TOWN. UNTIL THE STATE OVER THERE ARE MY- IS THAT WE ARE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS FAILING BECAUSE OF THE SERVERS. SO IF THEY'RE RELATED TO. THE INVESTIGATION MY THOUGHT WAS AT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS FAIL. THEN WE GET BY ONE THOUSAND GOING TO BE UNABLE. TO TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOMS SO WHAT WE DID OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS THERE. WE PARTNERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND WE DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S AN ACTUAL PLAN. CAN WE STARTED PUTTING CHIEF OFFICERS CAPTAINS AND PARAMEDICS. AND ENGAGING THEM HAVE. LOCAL HOSPITALS OF THE ARTS. TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR SEARCH. NOW I DID THAT ON MY OWN DIME BECAUSE LIKE I SAID. IF I HADN'T DONE THAT THEN AREN'T WE WHAT WOULD WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ARGUMENTS MISSION. I DON'T HAVE A COST FOR THAT RIGHT NOW BETTER LATER DATE- YES THEY COME UP WITH THEIR- PLAN. TO INSERT PARAMEDICS AND- ARMED. FIREFIGHTERS IN THE HOSPITALS WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT PLAN ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT EFFECTIVE. IT WASN'T FORTY MAYBE WHAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES M. AS A REGIONAL COORDINATOR OF THE SIX WITH THE CORNERS AND THE STATE I'VE HAD MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS. TO YES THAT'S RIGHT TO MY PERSPECTIVES- I WON'T SAY THAT BY PERCENT PERSPECTIVES WERE COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED. BUT BE WARNEDCORPORATE IN INTO THE PLAN. AND THAT'S WHY I SAID I THINK LATER WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT LESSONS LEARNED. WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER COLLABORATE. THE FUTURE THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE RIGHT NOW OUT YOU KNOW THIS KIND THEM IS REALLY A NOMINEE FOR THIS. GENERATION OF MOST RESPONDENTS. WELL MAYBE WE CAN GET THE FINANCE- THE PEOPLE ON THAT WOULD THAT ISSUE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE AGENCY IS REIMBURSED AND- IT DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE POCKETS OF. THE. FOLKS THAT HAVE DONE ALL THIS SERVICE I GOING TO. ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO AHEAD NOW I HAVE OTHER. BUT ALL LET OTHERS FOR NOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ORDER. YES THANK YOU I'M THINKING FOR THE PRESENTATION MORNING AND- FORMER ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AND CALLING- FROM ALL YOU AGENCY FOR A YEAR OF SERVICE AND WILL. HAS BEEN OF THE MOST CHALLENGES- OF YOUR CAREER SO- SINCERELY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR DOING AND CONTINUE TO DO. I HAD QUESTIONS FOR ON BOTH THE DOCTOR SIMON IN DOCTOR SAYS AND I THINK FROM A LARGE AND SMALL COUNTY PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW EFFORT KIND OF THINKING FOR ABOUT HOW TO REALLY GET THROUGH HOPEFULLY THESE FINAL MONTHS. I'M WONDERING HOW YOU'VE BEEN INTEGRATING YOUR CONTACT TRACING STRATEGIES AND YOU'RE SORT OF GETTING THE MESSAGING OUT THERE THAT TESTING CONTINUES TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MONITORING FOR- BEING A POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS POTENTIAL CLUSTERS- WE KNOW THE CONTACT TRACING BECAME. MORE RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE TOOL AS SURGEONS WERE HAPPENING BECAUSE IT JUST BECAME OVERWHELMED BUT NOW WE'RE BACK IN A STATE WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY START TO ISOLATE ANY COMMUNITY UP BREAKS- AND THEN FURTHER MORE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND I'M CONCERNED WITH UP IN EUREKA- AND HUMBLE COUNTY I KNOW NEITHER OF YOU- REPRESENT THAT BUT- DO YOU HAVE SORT OF CONTINGENCY PLANS. PREPARED SHOULD YOU START TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY A SIGNIFICANT CLUSTER A COMMUNITY OPERATE TO REALLY KEEP THAT CONTAINED. I'M HAPPY TO START THIS IS SOFTBALL SIMON L. A. COUNTY- WELL WE YEAH WE REMAIN VERY COMMITTED TO- CONTACT TRACING AND IN FACT. NOW IT'S BECOME MORE MANAGEABLE WITH THE NUMBERS BEING DOWN. WHERE THEY ARE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE SURGE I MEAN WE REALLY HAD TO- YOU KNOW JUST CONTINUE A LOT OF- THOSE. EFFORTS SO IT REMAINS A PRIORITY- NOT ONLY. ARE TO HELP FOLKS. GET TESTED AND TO GET THE OTHER SERVICES THEY NEED BUT ALSO WE VIEW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE VACCINE HESITANCY ISSUE- WE ARE HEARING- FROM A NUMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS THAT ONE. REASON WHY SOME ARE- DECIDING NOT TO BE VACCINATED IS BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY HAD INFECTION THAT JUST DON'T THINK- THAT VACCINATION THEREFORE IS NEEDED AND SO. WERE UP WE'RE REALLY. URGING THEM FROM TO BE VACCINATED AS PART OF OUR CONTACT RAISING OUR CASE INVESTIGATION WORK AND THEN AS WE REACH OUT TO CONTACTS UP LIKE WISE TO DO THE SAME AND THEN ONCE WE DO VACCINATE PEOPLE NOW URGING THEM TO ENCOURAGE THEIR FRIENDS AND- FAMILY MEMBERS TO BE VACCINATED- TO THE UP TO THE ISSUE THE OUTBREAK CONTROL. BEEN THAT REALLY IS BRAND BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH AND I THINK AS VACCINATION COVERAGE. RATES CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND HOPEFULLY CASE UMBERS CONTINUE TO GO DOWN WILL BE ABLE TO TREAT THIS. AND ETHNIC- MORE LIKE WE TREAT OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WHERE WE DO HAVE A VERY VIGOROUS. TOP RESPONSE- TO THE TO OPERATE CONTROL. YEAH THIS IS DOCTOR SAYS THAT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD TO IT WILL IT DR SIMON SAID ALL MADE IN YOLO COUNTY WE CONTINUED MESSAGE THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING I THINK EVERY TIME I GIVE A PRESENTATION AND SPEAK WITH THE MEDIA THAT IT'S THAT IS ONE OF MY MESSAGES IS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO REMAIN UNVACCINATED THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING WE'VE BEEN PARTNERING WITH HEALTHY DAVIS TOGETHER WHICH IS DOING EXTENSIVE TESTING IN THE- IN THE CITY OF DAVIS AND ALSO THAT THE UNIVERSITY DOING EXTENSIVE TESTING OF ITS DICKINSON AND STAFF. AND SOME OF THEIR OR THEIR DEEPER POCKETS AND- WORKING WITH THEIR MARKETING COMPANY TO HELP ADVERTISE- OUR OPTUM CERTAIN OTHER TESTING SITES AND ALSO EMPHASIZING TESTING IT IN OUR MIGRANTS- WORKER A COMMUNITIES WHO RECENTLY ARRIVED IN INYO COUNTY FOR THIS YEAR AND START GROWING SEASON- SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A BIG PIECE OF WHAT WE CONTINUE TO DO IS GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING- WE ARE SIMILAR TO L. A. COUNTY EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES KEEPING UP WITH THE SURGE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES AND HOW TO PRIORITISE. WHICH CASES RECEIVE FULL CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE WERE ABLE TO DO A FULL CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING ON EVERY CASE- BUT WE RELY HEAVILY ON A BORROWED STAFF FROM THE STATE'S REDIRECTS I BELIEVE WE HAVE FIFTY ONE THE STATE RE DIRECTS OR ASSISTING WITH THE CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING AND YOLO COUNTY- WERE HEARING THAT THEIR THEIR MISSION. MAY AND THE IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE AND SO PLANNING FOR THAT TRANSITION AND ALSO LEVERAGING A SOME OF THE RECENT FUNDING COMING FROM THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STAFF UP OUR YOU'LL COUNTY STAFF TO FILL IN BEHIND THE STATE REDIRECTS WHEN THEY RETURN TO THEIR THEIR THEIR DAY JOB SO TO SPEAK SO A LOT OF US STAFFING. SHIFTS HAPPENING ON ALL BY. BUT CAUGHT- WITH EACH THE YOUR COUNTIES THE AS WELL AS THE STATE REDIRECTS FOR THE TIME BEING THAT WE CAN DO A FULL CASE INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT TRACING. ABOVE ROUTINE CASES AS WELL AS IN OUTBREAK SITUATIONS. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IGOR KOREAN QUESTION YEAH GOOD MORNING AGAIN THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER TODAY AS WELL THANK YOU TO FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART FOR ALL OF THE PRISONERS TODAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE IS DIRECTED TO A DR SASAN- FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR YELL COUNTY AND HOW MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VACCINATED. BUT I DO HAVE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP IN I WANTED TO SIGNAL ITS FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE RIGHT SMALL COUNTIES ARE MORE FLEXIBLE- AND NIMBLE AND CAN PIVOT QUICKLY. AND I THINK THAT WE WERE PUT IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION WE WERE TRYING TO GET- MY TURN UP AND- IT KIND OF I THINK WAS A HICK UP NOT FOR. OUR SYSTEM I THINK SHE DID THAT HER DEPARTMENT DIDN'T INCREDIBLE JOB BUT- HAVING TO PIVOT WAS. WAS DIFFICULT I THINK AND IT TOOK A LOT OF TIME AWAY FROM. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS GETTING VACCINATIONS OUT TOWARD OUR PEOPLE- THE QUESTION I HAVE THIS COME UP WITH JUST FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IS THAT HOW DO WE KNOW AND THIS COULD BE PROBABLY ANSWERED BY ANYONE. HOW DO WE KNOW OUR NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE FOR AT VACCINATIONS BECAUSE- I HAVE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. THE LIVING YOLO COUNTY THEY GOT VACCINATIONS AND SOLANO COUNTY. I HAVE VERY GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. ARE THAT THE- GOT VACCINATIONS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY HOW WAS UP INFORMATION- PUT TOGETHER SO THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR YOLO COUNTY. ARE INCLUSIVE OF THOSE OTHER COUNTIES WHERE FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE GONE OUT OF OUR COUNTY FOR THE VACCINATIONS. YEAH BUT BUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO HOW YOU QUERY THE DATABASES- BUT WE DO CAPTURE THE ADDRESS OF THE PERSON WHO'S BEING VACCINATED NOT JUST THE LOCATION WHERE THEY ARE BEING VACCINATED SO WHEN OPPORTUNITY NEUROLOGISTS GOES INTO THE SNOW FLAKE DATABASE ARE. TO RUN THE DATA YOU'LL COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO WERE BACKS WHO'VE BEEN VACCINATED TO DATE THAT IS BASED OFF ON THE ADDRESSES- SO WHETHER YOU'RE A YOU'LL COUNTY RESIDENT WHO GETS VACCINATED IN SOLANO COUNTY OR IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHEN WE QUERY BY ADDRESS- FOR YOLO COUNTY WE WILL FIND YOU- SO YOU WON'T SHOW UP AS BEING VACCINATED BY YOLO COUNTY- BUT YOU WILL SHOW UP AS A YOLO COUNTY RESIDENTS- AND SO. YOU WILL BE IN IN OUR DATA- SO YOU CAN BE YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT- AS LONG AS YOU LIST YOUR CORRECT ADDRESS OF RESIDENTS IT WILL YOUR VACCINATION WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO YOUR COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. NOT THE COUNTY WHERE YOU ARE VACCINATED. HELLO THAT I KALRA WITH YOU BUT INITIALLY I THINK WITH SOME FRIENDS THE FAMILY DID NOT NECESSARY PUT THE RIGHT ADDRESS ON THERE SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE- VACCINATION IN ANOTHER COUNTY. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT- AND LASTLY HOW CAN WE HELP YOU- I THINK ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT NOW THAT THEY'VE HAD THE VACCINATION THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE TESTED. AND SO AS THE LEGISLATURE WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU. TO HELP THAT MOVE ALONG BECAUSE UP I AGREE THAT YOU ARE DOING A GREAT JOB DAVIS HAS A GREAT WEBSITE THAT COMMERCIAL. BUT STILL PEOPLE ARE HESITANT THEY FIGURE THEY'RE DONE- WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU. WELL THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT I UP APPRECIATE THE OFFERS WHAT I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST SUPPORT THAT. ARE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND OTHERS I CAN PROVIDE IT IS REALLY IN THE ECHOING THE MESSAGES THE THAT WERE PUTTING OUT FROM. FROM OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENT SEVEN AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY IS- PARTICULARLY AROUND VACCINATION EMPHASIZING THAT IT IS. THAT IT IS SAFE THAT IS THAT IT IS EFFECTIVE THAT IT'S FREE AND THAT IT'S WIDELY AVAILABLE. I'M ONE OF THE SORT OF MIXED BLESSINGS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE MORE SUPPLY THAN DEMAND- IT IS THAT IT'S NOW EASIER TO GET A VACCINE THAN IT EVER. HAS BEEN AND SO I THINK SHARING THAT NEWSLETTER I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING NOT WANTING TO HAVE TO STAY ON THE LINE. ALL OR HALF OF TO FIGHT AND JOCKEY FOR A VACCINE BY REFRESHING THE BROWSER EVERY FIVE MINUTES- IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THAT NOW IS THE NOW IS THEIR TIME THE PERSONAL LINE- SO ENCOURAGING THOSE WHO'VE BEEN WAITING TO GET VACCINATED BUT ALSO. JUST IT REALLY PUSHING THE MESSAGES ABOUT THAT THE SAFETY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS. AND THE NO COST NATURE OF. THE VACCINES. REALLY OUR OUR TECH OUT OF PANDA. YEAH IN MY LAST COURSE IS THAT- I PRE. THE MOBILE. OF SERVICES CLINICS THAT HAVE BEEN USED PARTICULAR FOR FARMWORKERS- AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH THE FARMERS IN YOLO COUNTY. I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO DO LESSONS LEARNED WITH SOME OF MY CENTRAL VALLEY FRIENDS. THAT ARE STRUGGLE HAVE STRUGGLED TRYING TO GET THE FARMWORKERS- VACCINATE I'M SURE YOU HAVE BUT- I HEAR THAT QUITE A BIT FROM MY CONSTITUENTS A DIFFERENT MEETINGS THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FARMWORKERS ARE NOT BEING- VACCINATED SO- JUST AS THE- LOVE FOR YOU TO SHARE. OUR LESSONS LEARNED WHAT'S BEEN THE SUCCESS INYO COUNTY. AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SERVICE I APPRECIATED. WHAT THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR A MEMBER FROM OUR FIRST PANEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PARTICIPATION. NOW YOU HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION. OF UP TO ONE AND ONE MORE QUESTION FOR GOING SECOND HIM YET BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS BETTER IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK- AND THIS CAN BE FOR. ANY OR ALL OF THE PEOPLE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WORK WE WERE STRUGGLING TO GET TAKE A DATE TO GET VACCINATED. THERE IS IT'S EITHER  LACK OF ACCESS OR LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE. RIGHT NOW WE ARE WITH THE MARKET IS FLOODED WITH VACCINATIONS AND SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WHAT IS OUR BIGGER CHALLENGE. BEFORE I WAS TOLD WELL IT'S KIND A LITTLE OF BOTH I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A LITTLE VOTES BUT IT'S EIGHTY TWENTY OR SO WHAT IS THE BIGGEST. THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO GETTING THOSE COMMUNITIES THERE DISADVANTAGED. THE VACCINATION IS IT A LACK OF WILLINGNESS OR LACK OF ACCESS. WE COULD START WITH G. BONTA BEYOND THAT. OKAY THINK AYE SAMMY YES WE CAN ACHIEVE OKAY YEAH SO I'M NOT THE EXPERT IS THE RELATES TO VACCINATIONS BUT- I'LL GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE- FIRST. THIS IS THE LACK OF ACCESS. ARM I THINK THERE WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY. COMMUNITY AND IN OUR COUNTY. THAT WAS CHALLENGE. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IT'S A PLACE TO ACCESS FOR HEALTHCARE OR OTHER SERVICES. OUR THAT WAS THE SITUATION. PREDATED COVERT NINETEEN AND SO WHAT COOPER NINETEEN OF HER. THERE'S THAT CHANGED OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HOPE NINETEENTH OF THE MOST ST COMMUNITIES THAT STRUGGLED FOR- HEALTH CARE ACCESS. OR PARTICLE ANYTHING WITH THE SAME COMMUNITIES THERE IT'S STRUGGLING NOW. AND THAT'S THE SUM A LARGE. ARM STRATEGIC APPROACH TO HOW WE ADDRESS THAT- MOVING FORWARDS- SILVA REYES TO VACCINES NOW I THINK IT'S AN ADDITIONAL ACCESS I THINK ITS WILLING THIS. I'M GONNA WE HAVE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES THERE ARE ARE ARE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BAD THING I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUOUSLY PROMOTE THE VACCINATION PROCESS AND TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE VACCINE AND IT ALSO COME UP WITH A STRATEGY. TO WORK WITH A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE MEDICARE AND HALF PROFESSIONAL HEALTH DISEASE OR VENDORS- GO TWO THESE ARE ALSO A PUBLIC COMPANY I BELIEVE THAT THOSE OF EXPERTS. ALSO TO IMPROVE THE- GET HOME DEPOT COMMITTEE THE COMMUNITY TO GET BACK TO DONE I KNOW. WAS MADE EARLIER. IN SOME WE'RE GOING THE PART. THE SYSTEM OF THE OWN VACCINE. OF PROCESS AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS THE PARTY BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR PARAMEDICS- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MISSING THEM I'M NINETY ONE MISSION. AND THEY WERE GETTING INTO THE FIRE SEASON BUT I BELIEVE IT'S AN ABERRATION WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES. TOP AGENCIES AND- PRIVATE ENTITIES AND VENDORS TO BETTER PROVIDE ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES. IN NEED FOR VACCINES. I AM VERY GOOD CHIEF THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'LL DO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE UP. HERE TO HELP YOU GUYS WITH THE WILDFIRE SEASON TO. ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO A TO THAT BEFORE MOVING TO THE NEXT. WITH THAT SAID ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PARTICIPANTS ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR.

SEDATE ABSOLUTE OVER NINE CALUMET MEMBERS ON THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DEPLOYMENTS AGAIN TO SUPPORT OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEDICAL MISSIONS. INCLUDING THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE RESPONSE. MEMBERS ARE ALSO BEING UTILIZED TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE PUBLIC VACCINATION CLINICS. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCOR PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO RECRUIT LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INCLUDING RETIREES USING THE DISASTER HEALTHCARE VOLUNTEER SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVE PROGRAM APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AMPS IS REGISTERED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS IN THE DHD SYSTEM AND ON BOARDED OVER TWELVE HUNDRED. HEALTH CORE CLINICAL PROFESSIONALS FOR IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT TODAY HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL. OF FILLED OVER THIRTY SIX HUNDRED SHIPS. BUT WITH MATH FACILITIES JUST A OVER NINETEEN RESPONSE. THE REST WILL BE STAR. THE BILL POOL RED ALSO SIR TO BOLSTER THIS HELP BONTA MEDICAL WORSE CORPS AND COME OUT MEMBERS MEMBER SAYS HELP OR WERE READ. JUST A PROGRAMS WERE APPROACH. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CORP TRANSITION TO MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE- OTHER SUCCESSES BRIEFLY INCLUDE AT THE PHD SYSTEM DISASTER HEALTHCARE VOLUNTEERS IT'S THE MANAGES THE PHD PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCALLY ASSIGNED DH GAVE MEDICAL RESERVE CORPS COORDINATORS. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR LOCAL USED TO SUPPORT LOCAL RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES ONE YEAR AGO THERE WERE SEVENTEEN THOUSAND REGISTERED VOLUNTEERS CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS. REGISTERED IN THE DHD SYSTEM DURING THE COPA NINETEEN RESPONSE OVER FOUR THOUSAND DHD AND MRC VOLUNTEERS WERE DEPLOYED TO SUPPORT LOCAL RESPONSE EFFORTS- ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL WAREHOUSE SPACE WAS A SUCCESS FROM STUFF. BEFORE THE CODE RESPONSE- YEP SAYS DMS DIVISION RAN ALL OPERATIONS OUT OF ONE THIRTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT WAREHOUSE. FROM MARCH TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH CURRENT. I AM SAYS ALLIANCE. BUT TWO LARGE WELL WAREHOUSES TO NOW SUPPORT RESPONSE EFFORTS WITH A COMBINED SPACE OF JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF THIS ALLOWS US TO ACCEPT HOUSE ORGANIZE AND MAINTAIN OUR GREATLY EXPANDED RESOURCES. AND ALSO SERVED AS THE STATE REPORT REPOSITORY FOR VENTILATORS AND ALL DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AS REQUIRED BY OUR LOCALS AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. THE AMBULANCE STRIKE TEAM PROGRAM IS CERTAINLY WORTHY OF ITS OWN CONVERSATION SPENT ON IMMENSE SUCCESS IN ATTRACTING PROGRAM PROVED INVALUABLE DURING SEVERAL ASPECTS OF CODE NINETEEN AND THE TWENTY TWENTY WILDFIRE RESPONSE. ACTIVITIES INCLUDED A STATE WIDE SUPPORT FOR PATIENT MOVEMENT- EVACUATION OF THE DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP SUPPORT TO IMPERIAL COUNTY. DURING WHICH SHOT MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY PATIENTS WERE MOVED OUT OF THAT COUNTY DURING THE FIRST SEARCH THERE TO HELP DECOMPRESS HOSPITALS- ALSO EVACUATING MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PATIENTS DURING THE WILDFIRES. IN ALL OVER SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PATIENT TRANSPORTS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED STATEWIDE. THROUGH THE STATE WIDE- DISPOSITION CENTER AND ANNALYNNE STRIKING CENTER PROGRAMS ARE THERE BEEN MANY LESSONS LEARNED REGARDING PATIENT MOVEMENT AT THE END OF THE STRIKING PROGRAM. IT'S A PLANS TO CONTINUE LEADING THE EVELYN STRIKE TEAM AND FIVE THREE WORK REAL. WELL WHICH DID KICK OFF JUST SHORTLY BEFORE COVERED RESPONSE IS OBVIOUSLY BEEN ON HOLD THROUGH THIS RESPONSIBILITY THAT READY TO RESTART THAT PROGRAM. AND TO HELP BUILD ON LESSONS LEARNED TO ADVANCE SCANDAL STRUCTURED PROGRAM. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUS GANDA'S TRACKING PROGRAM IS NOW BEING UTILIZED TO. CREATE A- VACCINATION DELIVERY PROGRAM FOR THE HOME BALLOT- YES IS IMPROVEMENT PLANS CURRENTLY AND AFTER ACTION PLANS CURRENTLY INCLUDE. UPDATING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FROM OUR LESSONS LEARNED ALL THREE IN COVERT RESPONSE AND FIRE RESPONSE. THE PROTEAS TO ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES ENSURING EFFECTIVE AND IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS SAYS COMMENTED EARLIER- AND PROCESS FLOW FOR SITUATIONAL REPORTING RESOURCE REQUESTING RESUPPLY AND RESOURCE TRACKING. ENSURING EFFECTIVE STATEWIDE PATIENT MOVEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF STAFFING NEEDS TO THE SIZE AND DURATION OF THIS RESPONSE. AND LASTLY IMPROVING THE EMS HOSPITAL SYSTEM DATA INTERFACE TO IMPROVE. S. I. E. THE STATE AN ABSOLUTE TOWARDS DIRECT AND REAL TIME DATA ACCESS SO THAT WE CAN MORE CLOSELY TRACK THE MOST IMPORTANT DATA SETS TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS. THE QUOTE HEALTH OF OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM I'M NOT HAVING REAL TIME DATA WAS- A CHALLENGE DURING THE CODE RESPONSE AND WE ALL WANT TO PUSH TOWARDS A REAL TIME DASHBOARDS AND READY ACCESS TO DATASETS AS AS REQUIRED. ABOUT A QUICKLY MY REPORTS OF PENDING ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR DUNCAN ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE A CRTE JOHNSON ON THE LINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING FROM THEM SO BEFORE GOING TO THE NEXT THE- PERSON. OUR GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. I KNOW- DR DUNKIN I THINK COVERED REALLY ALL THE ASPECTS OF THAT I WOULD DOUBLE GINGERLY. COMMENT ON HOWEVER I AM HERE TO ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO NOW THE NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A DOCTOR THOMAS ARE GONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- DR THOMAS. OKAY GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHURCH RODRIGUEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AND LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING LOCALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL DISASTERS ARE LOCAL AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO HAVE REALLY I HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN SOME OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO SAY. THAT I WILL SUMMARIZE FOR YOU. FIVE I ALSO COME FROM LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF MY FIFTH MONTH SO BRING SOME OF MY LOCAL PERSPECTIVE INTO WHAT I REPORT TO YOU TODAY. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME NUMBERS. SO AS OF YESTERDAY. IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE ONLY TWO DEATHS THAT WERE REPORTED. THIS IS THE LOWEST CAL THAT I AM THIS IS THE LOWEST COUNT THAT I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER I HAD TO DOUBLE CHECK JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS NOT AN ERROR. OUR EFFECTIVE REPRODUCTIVE NUMBER IS LESS THAN ONE IT'S ABOUT POINT EIGHT EIGHT. OUR DAILY. THE POINT 1% FOR THE MOST RECENT WEEKS FOR WHICH OUR DATA IS AVAILABLE FOR- THE UNITED STATES- CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF ITS CASE RATE IS THE NUMBER ONE HAS A LOOP HAS THE LOWEST CASE RATE IN THE COUNTRY IN IN THE MAINLAND. IT IS ONLY IN HIS RANK TWO IF YOU INCLUDE HAWAII. IN TERMS OF TEST POSITIVITY WE HAVE THE LOWEST TEST POSITIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES. IN TERMS OF HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS WE ARE RANKED NUMBER TEN. IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF DEATHS AMONG THE TOP THE TEN MOST POPULOUS STATES WE HAVE THE LOWEST DEATH RATE. OVER THE PAST WEEKS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT CUMULATIVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT CUBA- DEATH RATE WE HAVE INTEREST IN TERMS OF- BEING IN TERMS OF- HAVING TO THE LOWER NUMBER WE WOULD BE TWENTY NINTH MEANING THAT- WE HAVE AMONG THE LOWEST CUMULATIVE DEATH RATES. IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT'S REMARKABLE CONSIDERING THAT CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AREAS WHERE CO THAT ENTERED AN IMPACT IT IMPACTED IN IMPACTED BOTH THE WEST COAST AND EAST COAST FIRST. IN TERMS OF ACTING UPDATE THE OPERATING HEARD SOME OF THE NUMBERS OVER A THIRTY POINT FIVE MILLION DOSES HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED. WE HAVE TWELVE POINT SIX MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FULLY VACCINATED THAT FORTY POINT FOUR. WE HAVE SIX POINT TWO MILLION VACCINES ARE ADMINISTERED IN DEBT WHETHER WE CALL THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX QUARTILE ONE WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN AND IN A MOMENT. OVER 60% OF OUR POPULATION HAS RECEIVED OVER ONE DOSE. OF PERSONS OVER SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD 75% HAVE RECEIVED. MORE THAN ONE DOSE AND SIXTY ONE OF THEM OF SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER ARE FULLY VACCINATED. THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS UNFORTUNATELY PLEASE CONTINUE TO HAVE VACCINE INEQUITIES THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX WHICH HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY OUT ABOUT WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN A CATEGORIZING LOOKING AT ACROSS CALIFORNIA LOOKING BOTH THE CENSUS TRACTS IN ZIP CODES LOWER INCOME AREAS AND HIGHER INCOME AREAS PLACES THAT ARE ARE ARE LEFT RESOURCE IN PLACES WHERE PERSONS OF COLOR- CONCENTRATE. CURRENTLY IN THE QUEUE ONE QUARTILE WHICH IS THE LEAST ADVANTAGED THE LOWEST INCOME R. O. ONLY 47% HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE BE WE SHOULD BE PROUD THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED 47% HOWEVER IN OUR HIGHEST INCOME QUARTILE THE MOST ADVANTAGE ADVANTAGE IT'S SEVENTY ONE PERCENT. AND THAT'S THE IN EQUITY IN THAT THE GAP THAT WE REALLY WE REALLY NEED TO CLIP WE WOULD REALLY NEED TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE THAT WE BEEN USING OUR TO LEAD WITH SCIENCE COMPASSION EQUITY. TO INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION OVERALL TRANSMISSION ANYWHERE AND THE IMPACT IN THE MOST THE MOST LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ANY TRANSMISSION THAT HAPPENS WE KNOW THAT IS THE ESSENTIAL THE CENTRAL WORKERS HAVE BECOME INFECTED THEY BRING IT BACK INTO THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. WHICH TEND TO BE OVER COURT OVERCROWDED AND TRANSMISSION IS VERY IS VERY HIGH. AND THEN OF COURSE WE ALSO WANT TO PRIORITIZE UP FOCUSING ON THE HIGHEST IMPACT COMMUNITIES. THE WAY THAT WE HAVE FOCUS ARE FAXING PROGRAMS HAS BEEN WITH THREE KEY PRINCIPLES SAFETY. EQUITY AND TRANSPARENCY. SO I HAD MENTIONED THAT THE H. B. I. COURT DATES BACK QUARTILES HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN USE CONSISTENTLY WE USE THAT DURING OUR OUR BLUEPRINT TO INCENTIVIZE TO INCENTIVIZE TESTING AND GETTING FOCUSED ON THE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND THEN WE USE THAT FOR A VACCINE EQUITY MET UP AT METRIC WHICH IS ZIP CODE BATES THE REASON WHY WE USE THE ZIP CODES BASED MASSIVE METHOD BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CENSUS TRACK IS THAT NOT EVERYBODY WILL GIVE YOU THEIR ADDRESS BUT PEOPLE ARE USUALLY WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE ZIP CODE. SO THERE WAS. A QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW IT- IF SOMEBODY- YOUR ACCOUNT BEEN BACK. AND SO THAT THAT'S A THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ARE TERM OF OUR DAY STRATEGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE THE ZIP CODE BASIS THAT WILL ALL SEACM K. RATE BY THE DIFF TACK. BUT ALSO A LOT TOWN SAN DIEGO WHO IN THEIR ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN ACROSS THIS. THE OTHER POINT THINK ABOUT OUR FAX. THIS WAS. BOB ARE PER. STRATEGY AND WE DO IT HAVE IT DURING THE HIGH. SEARCH WHEN THE HIGH. WITH THE HIGHEST SEARCH FOR HAPPENING LET ME FOR OF ALL SIR SAYING THAT WE KNOW THE- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THOSE THAT MOST AND- PUTTING THOSE. WERE OF WITH THE GROUP WAS MOST IMPACT MEDINA REPRESENT THIRTY NINE. OF THE POP. IN CALIFORNIA THEY REPRESENTED 60% OF THE CASES. AND 46% OF THE DEATH. PAID PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE. THAT MEANS THAT. THE IN THE HOT IN THE HOSPITAL DURING THE SEARCH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOSTLY IMPACTED WHO WERE IN THE HOSPITAL I SEE YOU. AND WE'RE DYING. WERE PEOPLE OF PEOPLE OF. COLOR PRIMARILY LATINO. AND WE'RE REAL IS THAT WE NEED TO SHOW TO IN A BASED. BECAUSE WE HAD TO WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A THIRD STRATEGY THAT WAS SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT AND THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITH SPEED THE IDEA WAS IS THAT. BURGO WE KNOW THAT. THE OLDER OLDER FOLKS ARE THE ONES THERE AND THEN UP IN THE HOSPITAL AND DYING AS OUR FAXING STRATEGY HOW TO PAY THAT BY PRIORITIZING. BY PRIORITIZING AGE THEN WE PRIORITIZE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND THEN PERSONS WITH DISABILITY AND THE LAST IMPORTANT PILLAR OF THE STRATEGY IS THE CONCENTRATOR OUT REACH AN ALLOCATION AND OUR EFFORTS. IN THE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES QUARTILES ONE INTO SO THE COMBINATION OF AGE MEDICAL CONDITION DISABILITY AND THEN. AND THEN- CONCENTRATING IN. THE AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. SO WHEN YOU THE- OVERALL OVERALL STRATEGY THERE WERE THERE WERE FIVE MAJOR AIR FIVE MAJOR AREAS THAT- THAT. THE WHAT'S CALLED THE THAT BOTH THE STATE AND THE T. PAY THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOCUSED ON WAS ALLOCATIONS OF 40% THE VACCINES. THAT INITIALLY GOING TO THE H. P. I. ONE QUARTILE THE- THAT THE LOWEST INCOME. DEVELOPING A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR DOCTOR- AMY SISKIND WHO MENTIONED THE I. YAHOO BENCHES- THE VFC PROGRAM FOR CHILDHOOD VACCINATIONS. AND THAT THAT PROGRAM WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT NEEDING TO BE ENROLLED IN THE T. PH. D.'S VACCINE PROVIDERS ALREADY KNOW HOW TO FAXING TO VACCINATE CHILDREN. HAVE AS ITS AS THE CHILDHOOD VACCINES BECOME AVAILABLE THEY'RE ALREADY IN PLACE THEY'RE ALREADY CONNECTED TO OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. DATA WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATE THAT WE GET AS MANY KIDS VACCINATED. AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THIRTY AREAS WORKING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE AREA IS WITH IS WITH DATA. AND DATA WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. HISTORICALLY WE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE GOT A VACCINE REGISTRY FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS NOT AT THE LEVEL OF. PREPAREDNESS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR US TO REALLY HAVE THE QUALITY OF DATA SO THAT WE CAN REALLY TRACK METRICS. I KNOW EXACTLY WHO'S GETTING VACCINATED WHERE THEY LIVE AND COLLECTING SUFFICIENT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WE CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS ON EQUITY. SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE DISPARITIES I MENTIONED TO YOU EARLIER ARE POSSIBLE WE COULD SEE THE DISPARITIES BECAUSE OF A QUOTE THE QUOTE DATA. QUALITY IMPROVED AND OF ALL SEVERAL STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEMS INCLUDING OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY OUR INVENTORY SYSTEM CALL CA FAX MY TURN THAT HAD A COMPONENT WHERE ANYBODY CAN LOG IN INTO MY TURN REGISTER- AND GET AN APPOINTMENT AS WELL AS MY TURN CLINIC SO. PEOPLE COULD RUN A CLINIC. A TURN THAT DATA WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT STANFORD. WHO TOOK ALL THE ALL THE ALL THE WE KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS ALTHOUGH WE KNEW ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND HELPED US TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY. OF HOW WE CAN END THIS PANDEMIC AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND THE FASTEST WAY OF ENDING THIS PANDEMIC IS BY FOCUSING ON THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. THAT'S WHERE TRANSMISSIONS HAPPENING MOST BY AND THAT'S THE THAT THE FASTEST ROUTE INCIDENT THAT THE THOUGHT LEADING WITH SCIENCE WE CAN TELL THE WHOLE STATE HOPE. THAT BY FOCUSING ON THESE COMMUNITIES EVERYBODY BENEFITS. PUBLIC EDUCATION WE HAVE VACCINATE ALL FIFTY A CAMPAIGN DURING A TREMENDOUS FORMATIVE RESEARCH- FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- OUR RESEARCHERS FOUND IN LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING VACCINATED WHEN YOU LOOK AT LATINOS WITH A YEAR. SPANISH DOMINANT FOR BILINGUAL FLASH ENGLISH IT TURNS OUT THAT LATINOS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WILLING TO GET VACCINATED. SO REALLY. IT IS PRIMARILY AN ISSUE OF ACCESS. OPPOSITE ISSUE OF OUTREACH. OF AND THEN THE OTHER GROUP WHERE THERE IS IT THERE IS THERE'S LESS WILLINGNESS TO GET VACCINATED AND THAT'S IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO THERE'S LIKE A CONTRAST THERE WERE WE HAVE TO DO MORE WORK TO BUILD TRUST WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE'RE IT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING A NEW VACCINE EQUITY PLAN THE RIGHT NOW'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THIRTEEN COUNTIES. WHERE WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET TAT THE GOAL IS TO GET 75% COVERAGE OF IN THE EIGHT IN THE QUARTILE ONE THE LOWEST INCOME QUARTILE BY JUNE FIFTEENTH A LOT OF WORK AHEAD- THAT'S OUR GOAL LOOK WE'RE GONNA SEE YOU EVER GONNA BE ABLE TO REACH IT A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING AROUND THAT. AND AT THIS POINT IT'S REALLY ABOUT GETTING HYPER LOCAL I'LL JUST GIVING EXAMPLES OF TWO WEEKS AGO I WENT TO VISIT IN THE NATION IN THE MISSION DISTRICT- I WENT TO GO VISIT THAT WAS HAPPENING- HOW THEY WERE DOING OUR REGION IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO I WENT TO ST PETER'S CHURCH. IN THE CHURCH THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE SPANISH MASS THE PRIEST WOULD ASK PEOPLE HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN VACCINATED HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE DROPPED IT HOW MAY BE OF THE VACCINATED THEN AND THEN THE PRIEST WILL TELL THAT WELL. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVEN'T BEEN VACCINATED RIGHT AFTER CHURCH WE HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE OUT OUTSIDE THE DOORS SITTING THERE FOR WHAT CAN GET TO REGISTER. RIGHT AWAY TO GET TO GET VACCINATED. AND SO THAT A WE HAVE STOPPED THAT FROM PAUL. HEALTH ALSO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AS A WORKING WITH THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY WAS REALLY CRITICAL THEN I JUST WALKED OUT OF TWENTY FOUR THE MISSION WHERE THEY HAVE THE VACCINATION SITE. AND THE VACCINATION SIDE OF ONE SIDE OF THE STREET WHERE THEY DID VACCINATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE STREET THEY DID TESTING. IT'S A IT'S A TRANSPORTATION HUB WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE. BECAUSE YOU USED TO TAKE OUT THE SUBWAY. AND THE BUSES OUR MISSION STREET. AND SO WHEN YOU GET WHEN YOU WOULD GO THERE PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY FEEL VERY AT HOME- THEY WOULD HAVE MUSIC. THEY MADE THE PLACE VERY WELCOMING WHERE PEOPLE WERE SITTING DOWN- AFTER THEY RECEIVE THE VACCINE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FIFTEEN MINUTE OBSERVATION PERIOD. THEY WOULD COME AND TALK TO THEM FIND OUT HOW ARE THINGS GOING AT HOME HOW CAN WE SUPPORT YOU. IS THERE ANYBODY AT HOME THAT'S NOT VACCINATED- AND REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE GETTING BACK VACCINATED ARE THE BEST AMBASSADORS. ARE THE BEST AMBASSADORS. FOR GETTING VACCINATED RIGHT BECAUSE THEY CAN GO HOME AND BRING PEOPLE BRING PEOPLE BACK. BUT THE OTHER THING IS ACTUALLY I WE HAVE ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WAS TELLING US HOW THEY HAD A CAMPAIGN WHERE THEY JUST WENT DOOR TO DOOR DOWN THE COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS. INTO EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS. AND SAID AND TALK TO THE WORKERS ARE YOU IF YOU'RE NOT VACCINATED. WE'RE HERE TO GET YOU WE'RE HERE TO GET YOUR REGISTER TO GET YOU CONNECTED- THINGS LIKE PHONE BANKS YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE IN THE IN THE COMING WEEKS ABOUT THE EFFORTS THAT. CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE DOING INCLUDING PHONE BANKS. OF DOOR KNOCKING CAMPAIGNS WORKING WITH THAT FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS- OF LOCAL GRANTS FOR COMMUNITIES YOU ALREADY HEARD. FROM MS THAT ABOUT THAT. AT HOME VACCINATION PROGRAM AND THERE IS ALSO A FREE. A FREE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. SO I DO WANNA SAY TERMS OF. LESSONS YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT OF A LOT OF FOLKS CAN SAVE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE- WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THEM THE INEQUITIES EXISTED- BEFORE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE PET THAT MAKE JUST. REVEALED CAN AMPLIFY THE INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE AND WE JUST HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GO WE GO BACK AND FIX AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND THEN THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE REALLY SORT OF BALANCING HOW WE WORK WITH THE LOCALS AND THE LOCALS ARE REALLY ARE REALLY THE BEST THAT UNDERSTANDING THEIR COMMUNITIES AND REALLY DOING THAT LAST MILE OF ACTUALLY GETTING. GETTING A VACCINE VACCINES INTO COMMUNITIES THEY THEY UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE THE STATE ON THE OTHER HAND HOW SOME CAPABILITIES BECAUSE WE CAN WORK ACROSS COUNTIES WE CAN MOVE ASSETS ACROSS THE STATE WE CAN SUPPORT THEM WE CAN WORK A LARGE DATA SYSTEMS. THAT CAN REALLY HELP HELP HELP GUIDE THEM BUT ALSO HELPS GUIDE THE STATE EVERY PRIORITIZE RESOURCES AS THINGS EVOLVE SO I JUST FINDING THAT RIGHT BALANCE AND REALLY WORKING ON THAT PARTNERSHIP- I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY CRITICAL I WANT TO AGAIN THANK- THE CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK ALL THE LOCAL FOR ALL THE AMAZING WORK THAT YOU DO AND- RIGHT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS IN A GOOD PLACE SO KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. WE HAVE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE VARIANCE AND- YOU KNOW THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEFEAT THE PANDEMIC SO IT'S REALLY IT REALLY IS IT'S A IT'S A TEAM EFFORT IT'S ALL STATE EFFORT. YES I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR TO EVERYBODY FOR ALL THAT YOU DO. ALL SUPPORT THAT YOU GIVE US THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOT PURSE THAT AND FINALLY. HERE FROM OUR LAST- BUT IT'S BEEN WE HAVE DIRECTOR MARKED OVERDUE CHU FROM THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- MARK ARE YOU THERE. BROWN'S ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING THANKS A- ZURCHER ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGING THE STATE'S COVERT RESPONSE IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AT OF EQUITY. HERE IS A STATE AGENCY THAT THE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE OVERALL STATE'S RESPONSE TO DISASTERS OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MUCH THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT ABOUT THE OPERATIONS THAT SO MANY OPERATIONS THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THE CORPORATE RESPONSE AND MANY OTHERS YEAH WALL BOB WE'RE DEALING WITH COVERT BUT TODAY. I WANT I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF CALLAWAY GAS IN THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO VACCINATE CALIFORNIA'S. MOST AT RISK COMMUNITIES. AS A STATE HAVE BEEN- WE HAVE MUCH TO BE PROUD UP WE IMPLEMENTED INNOVATIVE FIRST IN THE NATION PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE THE PANDEMICS OF FACTS. ON THE STATE'S MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY COBIT NINETEEN IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. WE MUST COMMIT OURSELVES TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING OUR PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFY AND IDENTIFY EVEN MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER SERVE THEM. AS A STATE AS WE LEARN MORE FROM THE OUTCOMES OF THIS PARTICULAR EVENT. AS OF MAY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE STATE HAD A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF OVER THREE POINT SIX MILLION PROGRAM RELATED CASES AND FORTUNATELY OVER SIXTY THOUSAND. EIGHT CALORIES HOWEVER TODAY WE HAVE A POSITIVITY RATE OF ONE POINT ONE WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWEST IN THE NATION. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CELEBRATE. EQUITY IS AT THE CORE OF THE STATE'S COVERT RESPONSE. FULLY INTEGRATING EQUITY PLANNING PRINCIPLES IT ALL PHASES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HELPS EMERGENCY MANAGERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE OF COMMUNITY AND HOW TO CREATE PROGRAMS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THAT FOR FILL THOSE NEEDS. EARLY IN THIS OF AT HELLO YES ESTABLISHED WELL OVER TWENTY TASK FORCES WHICH INCLUDED EXPERTS FROM VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES TO DEVELOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE ON ALL ASPECTS OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOR THIS EVENT. WELL ACCURATE WELL EQUITY WAS CERTAINLY A KEY PRIORITY FOR ALL. TRUE PASSED FORCES STAND OUT CONSIDERABLY AND OUR COMMITMENT. TO AN EQUITABLE RESPONSE TO THIS VIRUS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY PASSPORTS IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE IMPACTS. TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY REGION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PREVENTION AND REDUCTION OF COVERT NINETEEN TRANSMISSION. AND A WHOLE SECTOR APPROACH. AND THE VACCINE TASK FORCE WHICH CONVENE TO INSURE CALIFORNIA HAS COMPREHENSIVE EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO EDUCATION AROUND COVERT NINETEEN VACCINATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON SAFETY AND- EFFICIENCY. THE NETWORK OF TASK FORCES WERE KEY IN DEVELOPING MANY OF THE PROGRAMS FOR SUPPORT G. SECTORS OF OUR COMMUNITIES THERE ARE SOME KEY EXAMPLES. PROJECT ROOM HE- THE FIRST SUCH PROGRAM IN THE NATION TO SECURE FEMA APPROVAL PROVIDE SAFE ISOLATION CAPACITY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OUR GOAL REQUIRE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ROOMS TO SERVE THIS COMMUNITY WAS REACHED ON MAY ELEVENTH TWENTY TWENTY. GREAT PLATES IS A FEEDING PROGRAM AIMED TOWARD SENIORS AND ADULTS AT HIGH RISK FROM KROGER NINETEEN. URGES THEM TO REMAIN AT HOME AND STAY HEALTHY BY DELIVERING THREE NUTRITIOUS MEALS A DAY. TODAY IT HAS SERVED OVER THIRTY TWO MILLION MEALS. HOUSING FOR THE HARVEST PROVIDES TEMPORARY EMERGENCY NON CONGREGATE SHELTER FOR FARMWORKERS UP A PLACE FOR SELF ISOLATE ISOLATION KEEPING THEIR FAMILIES EVER GREATER COMMUNITY SAFE. AS A CENTRAL WORKERS. HOTEL FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS HE WAS CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL SAFE AND HEALTHY BY REDUCING THE SPREAD OF THE COVER NINETEENTH VIRUS THROUGH FREE OR DISCOUNTED HOTEL ROOMS TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS OR PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS WHO GIVE CRITICAL CARE THE COVER NINETEEN PATIENTS SO THEY DO NOT BRING HOME. THE VIRUS FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD. VACCINATION SITES A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO THE PAD THAT MAKE. WAS IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WHEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE FIGHTING HERE SAID MINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A FIRST OF ITS KIND PARTNERSHIP TO BRING LIFESAVING VACCINES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES WERE CHOSEN AND WORK JOINTLY OPERATED BY- YES AND FEMALE. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THIS OPERATION THERE ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND STAFF FROM OVER FIFTY FIVE DIFFERENT STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. AND PRIVATE SECTOR DEDICATED TO THIS EFFORT WORKING ON THE GROUND AT THE SITE THE STATE AND FEDERAL SITES. TO BETTER SERVE THE COMMUNITY. AT THE AMPLIFY OUR EQUITY. REQUIREMENTS WE DESIGNED IT IMPLEMENTED A MOBILE VACCINATION CLINIC PROGRAM. IN EACH OF THESE LOCATIONS. BEYOND THE FIXED SITE. AND MOBILE UNITS WOULD GO OUT AND PENETRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY INTO THOSE AREAS THAT WERE MOST UNDERSERVED- AND AS WE'LL DISCUSS LATER. TO BE VERY IMPACTFUL THE COMMUNITIES. THESE TWO SITES ONE OF THE OAKLAND COLISEUM. EVERYONE AT THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY LA AWKWARD WHERE A DENTURE TGP LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES IN EAST LA. EVERY AREAS WHERE WE SAW HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF PROGRAM RELATED IMPACT AT ANY FOR OAKLAND ARE BOTH UNDER SERVED UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. IN TOTAL AS OF APRIL TWELFTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE ADMINISTERED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND VACCINATIONS TOTAL AT BOTH MASS VACCINATION SITES. A HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND OF THOSE VACCINATIONS OR THROUGH THE MOBILE UNITS. THE COMMUNITY VACCINATION CENTERS INCLUDED IN PERSON INTERPRETATION FOR SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPANISH VIETNAMESE KOREAN. HI ALL MANDARIN AND CANTONESE. ON SITE AS WELL AS PROVIDED IN PERSON A. S. L. INTERPRETATION. AND THE COMMITTEE VACCINATION CENTERS HAVE DEDICATED PARA TRANSIT LINES TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. OF THEIR SERVICE WITHOUT MUCH AGREEMENTS WITH THE PARA TRANSIT PROVIDER FOR FREE SERVICE TO AND FROM THE HOME OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH APPOINTMENTS WE UTILIZE SHUTTLES THAT FERRY BACK AND FORTH BUT LOCAL BOSTON TRADE SITES. IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. OVERALL THE MOBILE UNITS PROVIDED FIVE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND VACCINATIONS. OF THESE ALAMEDA COUNTY. AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND IF FORWARD MISSTATED LOS ANGELES. THE SUCCESS OF THE MOBILE UNITS IS A TESTAMENT TO THE RELATIONSHIPS WE BUILD WITH THE TRUSTED PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY. BE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALAMEDA PUBLIC HEALTH CONTRA COSTA PUBLIC HEALTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH BUT THE LOS ANGELES MAYOR'S OFFICE. AND THE LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPARTMENT THE SCHEDULE THE MOBILE SITES IN. IN LOCATIONS OF GREATEST NEED. WE IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED BY LOOKING AT TWO MEASURES IMMUNITIES IN THE LOWEST QUARTILE OF HEALTHY PLACE INDEX. ADMITTED WITH THE LOWEST VACCINATION RATE EACH MOBILE CLINIC. AS A HOST COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH THE OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IN THE VICINITY TO DO OUTREACH. LEADER TRUSTED COMMUNITY VOICES THAT CAN REACH COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN A WAY THAT WE JUST COULDN'T. IT WAS OUR JOB TO BACK THEM UP. WE MADE REAL TIME CHANGES ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AT THE MOBILE SITE. TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE IF WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS MORE. HOW TO LOG SPEAKERS AT ONE SITE FOR MORE WHEELCHAIRS WERE NEEDED AT ANOTHER RESPONDED IT REAL TIME TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. DURING THE EIGHT WEEK- YES FEMA MISSION WE PARTNERED WITH FORTY ONE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT SERVE. AS THE COMMUNITY LEAD. OUR MOBILE UNITS NINE CBO'S AT ELEVEN FBOS ALAMEDA AND FIFTEEN CBO IS. AT SIX FBOS IN LOS ANGELES. OF THOSE SERVED AT THE MOBILE CLINICS IN OAKLAND AS OF APRIL TWELFTH TWENTY TO. TWENTY ONE ALMOST 26% IDENTIFIED. AS LATICS. OVER 20% OF BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN AND OVER 23% OF ASIAN. AND LOS ANGELES OVER SITES IDENTIFIED AS LATICS. ALMOST 19% WERE BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN AND OVER 5% WERE ASIAN. SO NOW I LIKE TO PUT UP A CHART TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AS TO THE IMPACT. OF THE- OF THE MOBILE CLINICS AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THAT IS SHOWING THE- MOBILE VACCINATION KEEP FAX. AND YOUCAN SEE- FROM THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA BAR IN LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND. ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF- OF PENETRATION INTO THE- VARIOUS DEMOGRAPHIC. CHAPTERS AND IT IT REALLY OUR FOCUS WAS TO CONTINUALLY WORK TO- YOU KNOW REACH THESE. EQUITY NUMBERS HE'S EQUITY METRICS THE TEAM I DON'T WE ASIN FEMA AND ALL OF OUR PARTNERS CBO'S AND FBOS REALLY FOCUSED TO TRY APPLE FIVE THE ABILITY TO GET SHOTS IN ARMS INTO THESE COMMUNITIES IN MANY WAYS THESE MOBILE CLINICS ROCK THE SHOTS TO THEM. THIS WAS AN EFFORT OF GOING TO THEM. AT PLACE OF TRUSTED AREA. CHURCHES CLINICS AND OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY FELT MOST COMFORTABLE- TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SHOT YOU CAN SEE BY THOSE NUMBERS. ARE WHERE WHERE THINGS ARE HELLO LOOK LIKE. SO I'LL SHOW YOU KNOW WHAT HEATMAP UP AND GO TO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IT DEMONSTRATES- OUR. OKAY SO THESE ARE THESE ARE HEATMAPS THIS IS LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND- THIS IS ON A THREE FIVE- AS UNDERSERVED POPULATION RISK ANALYSIS AND YOU COULD SEE ARE IN THE IN THE- TRIANGLE THERE ON THE LEFT THE HIGH RISK HIGH VACCINATION LOW RISK LOW VACCINATION LOW RISK HIGH VACCINATION BY COLORS AND YOU CAN SEE. IF YOU IF YOU LOOK IN THE CENTER PART OF THAT- HEATMAP YOU SEE A LOT OF READ A LOT OF HIGH RISK LOW VACCINATION THIS IS EAST LOS ANGELES THE SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES- AREAS WHERE WE- E KNOW WE'RE SETTING UP MOBILE CLINICS- WE HAD OUR FIX LOCATION AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY LA AND THIS WAS THAT REPRESENTING- WE'RE FOR THE LITTLE GREEN DOTS ARE WHERE WE WERE PUTTING. OUR MOBILE CLINICS WORKING WITH CBO'S FBOS- AND THIS WS A VERY CONCERNING VERY INTENSE EFFORTS OF OUTREACH OF BEING ABLE TO BUILD TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY ARE BEING ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE VACCINE AND THIS WAS WORKING WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES THIS IS WORKING WITH OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND OTHER TRUSTED SOURCES ARE PASTORS AND OTHER KEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE TRUSTED TO BE ABLE TO HELP US AT THE SITES UP SO. THIS WAS ONE THREE FIVE GOES NEXT LIGHT. WE'LL SEE THAT- WE ARE- THESE ARE EIGHT P. I. I WILL TO IN SERIOUS YOU'LL SEE BUY THREE FOR. TEN DAYS LATER. YOU START TO SEE A REDUCTION IN THE- BOB OUT OF RED SO YOU'RE NOW MOVE- FROM THE HIGHER LOW VACCINATION. UPWARDS TOWARDS THE HIGHER RISK HIGHER VACCINATION. BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IF YOU GOT MORE DARKER GREEN. IN THAT AREA NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO ON THREE TWENTY FOUR- AGAIN NOW THINGS ARE LOOKING EVEN MORE DIFFERENT THIS IS WHERE WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HOW YOU SEE ALMOST NO RAD- NOW AND- AGAIN YOU'RE IN THAT MIDDLE ZONE BETWEEN. OUR LOW VACCINATION HIGH VACCINATION- AT STILL IN THE HIGH RISK. AREA OF THE COUNTY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THREE THIRTY M. R. LA AGAIN NOW- JUST THE YOU CAN SEE A CONTINUED TO MAKE MOVEMENT GETTING TOWARDS MORE TO THE GREEN OF THE HIGH RISK HIGH VACCINATION AND IN SOME AREAS GETTING INTO THE LOW RISK HIGH VACCINATION. NEXT LIVE WITH. RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN ALMOST ALL HIGH RISK HIGH VACCINATION. AND LOOKING VERY VERY POSITIVE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN OUT FOR THIRTEEN- REALLY YOU'RE NOW ALL- IN GREEN- HIGHLY VACCINATED- AND YOU WE SEE WE'RE MAKING EXTREME AT THE END OF THE UNDERSERVED- UNDER OUR RESOURCE AREA. EXACTLY OKAY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY SAME SORT OF STORY- HERE AGAIN H. B. I'VE WANTED TO ARE YOU SEE ON OUR OFFICE CENTRAL- EAST LOT EAST OAKLAND THIS IS UP THROUGH- UP THE THROUGHA THIRTY TOWARD RICH MAN AND BUT MOSTLY DOWN IN THE CORNER OF OAKLAND A PROMINENT AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY ASIAN COMMUNITY- AND YOU SEE ALL HIGH RISK LOW. VACCINATION NUMBERS NEXT LIKELY. BUT BUILT. LIGHT GREEN- DOT IS THE SITE AT THE OAKLAND COLISEUM END UP LIKE THE DARKER GREENS ARE THE MOBILE SITES THAT WE PLAY STRATEGICALLY I BET WORKING WITH C. B. HOURS AND THE COUNTY OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE. IMPLEMENTED OKAY SO THIS IS THREE FIFTEEN NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THREE TWENTY FOUR NICE START TO SEE THINGS TURN PRETTY GREEN AND GLASS READ THREE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THREE THIRTY. ALMOST ALL GREEN- IT'S KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN THE RED AND THE AND THE AND THE AND THE LIGHT GREEN THAT'S LIKELY TO. THAT'S WHAT WE- RIGHT AND SO YOU SEE WE'VE NOW MOVED INTO THE HIGH RISK HIGH VACCINATION- AREA AND IN MANY CASES YOU'RE SEEING A HIGH RISK A LOW RISK HIGH VACCINATION AS WE FLIPPED OUT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING A GOOD PENETRATION OF VACCINATION. EXACTLY OKAY I THINK THAT'S IT. SO A STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE NETWORKS KEY TO BUILDING OUT THE BETTER PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS FOR DISASTERS AND SWIFTLY MEETING IMMUNITY NEEDS DURING AND AFTER EMERGENCY EVENTS FOR EXAMPLE. HELLO YES IS LEAST BILLS PROGRAM WE DELIVERED EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THROUGH LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS WHICH ARE ISSUED TO CBO'S THE FUNDING DELIVERY OF IMPORTANT EMERGENCY INFORMATION IN A MANNER THEY DETERMINE IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE. UNDERSTANDABLE AND TIMELY CBO'S ARE GIVEN THIS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY ACTOR COMMUNICATE IN THE MOST CULTURALLY COMPETENT WAY. AT THE ONSET OF THE CORPORATE NINETEEN WE WORK TO SIMPLY. SIMPLIFY PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING. AND MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR THE PUBLIC AND VULNERABLE GROUPS WITH INFORMATIONAL PRINT AND ONLINE MATERIALS AND SOCIAL MEDIA GRAPHICS. THE COORDINATED STATEWIDE COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED BY THE CAMPAIGN REACHED A BROADER AUDIENCE OF ORGANIZATIONS VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TARGETED BY THE CAMPAIGN. IN CLOSING NATURAL DISASTERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES DO NOT. IMPACT ALL CALIFORNIANS THE SAME THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC MADE THAT PAINFULLY OBVIOUS. FORTUNATELY THE NEWS MINISTRATION. HAS MADE EQUITY FOR VALUE AND FUNDAMENTAL TO ITS FUNCTIONS. HELLO YOU HAVE HAS EQUITY DEBATE THE INTO WITH THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY CONSTRUCTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE GROWING INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES THE LOOMING THREAT OF THE NEXT BIG EARTHQUAKE AND ESPECIALLY THE THREAT OF A NEW PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN A MANNER THAT IS EQUITABLE FAIR. AND ENSURES THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US ARE ADEQUATELY PREPARED AND PROTECTED. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING STRONG AND EQUITABLE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC. TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS ONE THANK YOUR DIRECTOR AND THANK ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS FOR THEIR TIME AND TESTIMONY IN TODAY'S ARE HEARING. US WITHOUT WILL BRING IT BACK TO. THE COMMITTEE FOR OF MEMBERS QUESTIONS I HAVE A TWO QUESTIONS SO- ONE FROM I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE NUMBERS REGARDING. THE EQUITABLE OF- ISSUE. INEQUITIES WERE HAVING ENOUGH DISTANT COMMUNITIES NO A DOCTOR ARE GOING TALKED ABOUT FORTY ONLY VACCINATED BUT THEN AGAIN LOOKING AT THE COLOR CHART IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT BIKE THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE LIKE IT'S 70% RYE BROOK C. THAT THE COLOR CHANGES HAVE REALLY CHANGED A LOT SO THAT REALLY HAS ME A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHAT REALLY IS ARE THE PERCENTAGE BECAUSE I'M HEARING ONE NUMBER BUT THAT I'M SEEING A COLOR CHART THAT LOOKS TOTALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOUGH THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WERE THE HARDEST HIT WE CAN ALL AGREE. AND WE'RE DOING A LOT BETTER NOW BUT I'M JUST LOOKING FEES REGARDING THE COLOR CHART THE PERCENTAGE THAT'S ONE QUESTIONAND THE SECOND QUESTION I JUST HAD IS REGARDING- THE STATEWIDE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS REGARDING GREAT PLATES DELIVERED. AND PROJECT ROOM KAY I'M JUST ON THAT NOTE JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THOSE. HAVE BEEN OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE SO. WITHOUT ANYBODY CAN AFTER THOSE TWO. MAYBE THIS IS DOCTOR ERICA MAYBE I'LL TAKE THE FIRST ONE. SO IF YOU IF YOU GO TO THE GOVERNOR'S WEBSITE COVED NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV. AND THERE'S A LINK THERE THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE FACT THE BACK AT THE TOP OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THE TICKET A VACCINE. THE VACCINE DATA. AND IF YOU GO THERE YOU'LL YOU'LL GET TO SEE THEM. THAT BREAK OUT WHERE I GOT THAT THE THAT THE STATISTICS NE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS. IS THAT THERE'S TWO MAJOR STATISTICS THAT THEY'LL GIVE YOU THEY WILL SAY. OF ALL THE VACCINES THAT WERE GIVEN WHAT PROPORTIONS WENT INTO DIFFERENT QUARTILES THE H. BACK QUARTILES. SO THAT'S ONE TYPE OF STATISTIC. ED- AND YOU'LL END IT THAT'S THERE FOR FROM THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY MAXES OUT WITH WITHIN A QUARTILE. WITHIN A QUARTILE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. WHAT PROPORTION HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. A THAT GETS CONFUSING. BOTH BOTH OF THOSE THE TWO THINGS ARE IMPORTANT STATISTICS ONE GIVE AN IDEA OF THE ALLOCATION AND THE OTHER ONE GIVES THE SECOND ONE GIVES YOU THE IDEA OF COVERAGE WITHIN A QUARTILE. AND THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT BUT THEY CAN BE VERY CONFUSING AND IT'S UP IF YOU CAN BE A CHALLENGE. SO OFF FROM THE FROM THE WEBSITE WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS. WITH VAN QUARTILE ONE OF THE WITHIN QUARTILE ONE FOR VACCINE COVERAGE FOR VACCINE COVERAGE FORTY SEVEN POINT 1% HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOES- WITH AGAIN WITH AND WITHIN THAT QUARTILE TWENTY NINE POINT 6% ARE FULLY VACCINATED. THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S 53% OF ELIGIBLE PEOPLE THE COURTHOUSE IN INDIO COURTHOUSE ACROSS THE STATE THAT STILL NEED TO BE VACCINATED. NOW WITHIN THE HIGHEST QUARTILE HIGH SINGLE QUARTET WHICH IS QUARTILE FOR. POINT 4% HAVE RECEIVED- AT LEAST ONE SOUTH. 47% OF THOSE ARE FULLY VACCINATED AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S A REMAINDER OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT POINT SIX PERCENT. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL DISPARITY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT A SEVERITY TO FOCUS ON AT THE END OF THE DAY IS WHAT IS THE COVERAGE. I MEAN THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUCH A BIG FOCUS ON QUARTILE ONE IS BECAUSE WE WANTED WE WANTED WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE AS HIGH AS QUARTILE FOR THE HIGHER INCOME. TO ALL IN THERE THANK YOU. OKAY FIFTY S. NOT AND SO THIS IS UP SMART DR ARE GONNA. ALWAYS HELPFUL- I DON'T ALSO- SO I THINK DOCTOR ARE GONE LOOK- IN THE AGGREGATE BROUGHT. ACROSS THIS AND ARE EFFORTS WERE VERY. IN TWO- COMMUNITY VERY HI COMMITTEE- ADD THAT THE- THOSE THOSE. IN THE THOSE FOLKS. BEEN CUT BY. ABOUT THE LARGER NUMBERS BY COMPARISON TO SOME OF THESE TARGETED AREAS IN THE MISSION THAT. WE HAD- YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT NUMBERS IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE FOCUSED. OUR AREA CONCENTRATED THERE IF YOU WOULD THAT'S BE ABLE TO OPPORTUNITY FOR US THAT. OP ACTUALLY NUMBERS. AND I AM I'M SORRY- SOME I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR SECOND QUESTION. ARE THE SUB ONE WAS REGARDING THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SUCH AS GREAT PLATES DELIVERED AND PROJECT ROOM K. DISTRICTS HAVE THEY BEEN ADOPTED IN EVERY COUNTY OF THE STATE. YEAH SO THAT WELL BUT THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS BEEN LAID OVER IN EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE AND THAT OF COURSE IS YOU KNOW THEY- THE OP THE PRIVATE MINISTRATION MADE AND SHIPPED- AND- BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE THESE THESE ELIGIBLE PROGRAMS WE'RE GOING TO BE REIMBURSED AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT- AND- IT WAS NOT THE CASE WHEN WE STARTED THE. PANDEMIC IT WAS AT A COST- BUT NOW IS AND HOW 2% AND IT'S AND THOSE CAN THAT WE DON'T- YES AS WE- WITH EVERYTHING IN THE STATE WERE WORKING WITH US SAT REPUBLICAN CITIES WORKING WITH EACH OTHER CAL ADMITTED. ARE TO BE OVER- BUT THERE BY THEIR THIRD LOOK LIKE IF THE SO MANY OF THE COUNTIES HAVE NEEDED TO GET- EXPEDITE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE WERE THAT THE EX BUT I FOR AND THEIR- EDITOR BY SO IT HELP THEM BALANCE ALL- AND- YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF GREAT PLACE WELL I WANTED TO MENTION THAT. THAT YOU KNOW GREAT PLACE PROGRAM WAS WAS WAS PRETTY. IT WAS A DOUBLE BENEFIT REALLY IT WAS THE- I CAN'T TROUBLED BY. IF NOT ONLY PROVIDED. THAT TO EITHER SURE OR SENIOR THAT COULD GET OUT. IT A LOT IT WAS RUN. LOCAL REST IN THE- SO I FOR. RESTAURANTS THE- TO WE- UP ED KEEP FLOW AND BUT IF I ALLOW- RESTAURANTS KEEP PEOPLE IN. SO WE GOT A- WE HAVE A REST THE STATE OF. BOB AND WE WERE ABLE TO SERVE MEALS- ACROSS THE BOARD AND- AND AGAIN. FOR DATA THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BOTH. BOTH ROOM HE AND A GREAT PLACE. AND HOW HARPER HARPER'S HOUSING. FOR THE HARVEST. ALL ALL ALL WOULD BE UNDER THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND- AND L. FOR COUNTIES TO GET RECOUP COST. THANK YOU I THINK OF COURSE BY MEMBER DR YOU QUESTION YEAH GOOD. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESS- SO MUCH OF MY DAY DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THE INDUSTRY- AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FULL RE OPENING. ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. DO YOU KNOW IF CALIFORNIANS DOES CALIFORNIA NEED TO REACH ANY PARTICULAR METRICS IN ORDER TO FULLY OPEN ON JUNE FIFTEENTH OR IF WE WILL CONTINUE THE TREND THE WAY WE ARE. WILL THAT BE ENOUGH TO GET THE FULL RE OPENING. SO CURRENT CURRENTLY YEAH THE IN TERMS OF THE METRICS WERE LOOKING PRIMARILY AT THE VACCINATION COVERAGE AND THE DISEASE- OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF CASES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATHS. AS A STATE OVERALL WE'RE DOING FANTASTIC. AND IN TERMS OF VACCINATIONS WERE ALSO DOING VERY WELL. AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO ADD IS THAT THE FACT THAT THERE'S THAT THERE'S A VACCINE COVERAGE WHICH GIVES IMMUNITY. BUT THERE'S ALSO A PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION THAT HAD NATURAL INFRACTION INFECTION. SO THEY HAVE SOME OF THE MUNITY FROM THE NATURAL INFECTION SO WHEN YOU COMBINE ALL THAT UP- THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE- COMMUNITY RIGHT DOWN THE STATE IS GOING UP. SO WE'RE MOVING WERE ABSOLUTELY MOVING IN THE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT IT WILL BE A TRANSITION PERIOD. WE WANT THAT THE RATES TO CONTINUE TO BE AS LOW AS LOW AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THAT MAKES HIGHER RISK ACTIVITIES. A SAFER. I DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD WILL CONTINUE TO ASK PEOPLE TO WEAR A MASK ESPECIALLY INTO INDOORS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER JEFF QUESTION. YES I MEAN JUST A COMMON AND SEEMS LIKE WE STILL I THINK HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND SPECIFICALLY REACHING OUT TO LATINO COMMUNITY- IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES- SEE THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE BUT I THINK ONE. ONE THING I WOULD KNOW IS- I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF GO AND I THINK- DR PERASAAN- MADE THIS POINT I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE AS YOU KIND OF YOU NEED TO BE GOING TO THE PLACES THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW AND I THINK THE CHURCH IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHERE THAT REALLY WORKED WELL- ONE THING I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR FROM ANYBODY IS WHERE WERE OUR FOLKS IN LIKE IN THE VALLEY. ESPECIALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY- I KNOW WE HAD THESE MOBILE CLINICS AND I'VE BEEN IN OAKLAND AND LA- BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN LIKE WHERE IT'S BEEN A REAL FOCUS THE OUT REACH. FOR EXISTENCE IS TO THE FARMWORKER COMMUNITY- AND I REALLY THINK IT IT'S A MATTER WHAT I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE BEST PROGRAMS THAT ARE DONE REALLY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL- YOLO COUNTY I THINK FOR EXAMPLE- AND OTHERS HAVE REALLY TRIED TO FOCUS ON HOW DO WE GO OUT. ACTUALLY TO- THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY'RE AT WHERE THEY LIVE WHERE THEY WORK. TO REALLY- NEIL- ENSURE THAT THEY GET VACCINATED ARE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AN ACCESS TO I THINK HAVING THE REALLY LARGE EVENTS WHERE YOU COME COME TO A PLACE TO ME IT JUST FROM THE OBSERVATION DON'T SEEM TO BE WORKING AS WELL LIKE GETTING TO VACCINATING THESE COMMUNITIES ARE THEY GONNA DO A LITTLE MORE OUT REACH TO WHERE WHERE THEY'RE THERE AT- SO MAYBE W. ONE THING IS JUST HAVE. YOU GUYS RESPOND TO THAT- HAS THERE BEEN ANY REAL FOCUS ON. ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN TERMS OF DOING MORE OUTREACH- I HEARD THE OTHER MOBILE CLINICS IN THE AND- MORE URBAN PARTS OF THE STATE BUT- HOW ABOUT IN SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. YEAH THIS IS DOCTOR ERIC I'LL TAKE A FIRST SHOT YEAH. YES SIR THERE HAVE THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS. BUT THAT OF COURSE IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH IT'S SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE REAP REDOUBLING EFFORTS. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL ACTUALLY MAYBE SOMETIME THIS WEEK THIS WEEK- WILL BE ANNOUNCING ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. THERE IS GOING TO BE A FOCUS ON. THIRTEEN COUNTIES. WHERE WERE REALLY YEAH THAT'S GOING TO INCLUDE AREAS LIKE A FRESNO KERN BUT THERE MADERA- MERCED RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO SAN JOAQUIN STANISLAUS. INTO LARI SO WE ARE GONNA BE DOUBLING UP OUR EFFORTS AND IT'S REALLY A IT'S REALLY AS A STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE REALLY IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. IF THE CHURCHES IF THE CBO'S IF THE SCHOOLS. WITH A PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET REALLY HAVE TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO BUILD TO BUILD TRUST. UNDER IT THE STATE BY ITSELF CANNOT CANNOT DO IT. AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT THAN EVERY DIFFERENT LOCATION BECAUSE THE EVERY EVERY COMMUNITIES VERY VERY DIFFERENT BUT- YOU WILL SEE MORE EFFORTS YOU'LL SEE MORE EFFORTS IN THAT AREA OF MARDAN MOBILE CLINICS- THAT THERE IS THE HOME BROWN PROGRAM THAT YOU HEARD YOU HEARD ABOUT- FROM AND STUFF. SO STAY TUNED. FOR THE NEXT THE NEXT THAT A FEW WEEKS. MY EVERY MARKET ME JUST. DR GONE FOREVER AT THE EXIT AFTER OF WORK AYE LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A HUGE HUGE EFFORT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TASK FORCE THAT WENT ON. DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD BAD- THAT THAT REALLY TRY TO FOCUS ON THE HIGH CASE RATES AND MORBIDITY OF THE CENTRAL WORKERS THE ACT WORKERS- BUILT THE LATINO POPULATION THE DRESS THE ISSUES THAT THE- TASK FORCE WAS. CREATED TO FOCUS ON FOR BETTER OUTCOMES IN THESE COUNTIES AND IT WAS ENGAGE WITH WITH THAT CBO'S- WITH- WITH GROUPS REPRESENTING- FARMWORKERS- REPORTER AND BUSINESS OWNERS FARMERS. ARE WITH HOSPITALS AND WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ENTITIES ARE WITHIN THOSE- WITHIN THE REGION BOB THE EIGHT COUNTIES- AND WE DID A SIMILAR THING IN IMPERIAL COUNTY AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE GROWING SEASON THERE AND OF COURSE WE HAD CHALLENGES IMPERIAL COUNTY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH. QUALITY OF INDIVIDUALS THE CROSS THAT LIVE IN MEXICO AND CROSS THE BORDER FOR COMING TO WORK IN IMPERIAL COUNTY IN THE FIELDS AND IT'S A CRITICAL AT ENTITY A CRITICAL ELEMENT BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT FOOD SUPPLY AND SO WE HADN'T REALLY PUT A LOT OF EFFORT AND IT OF COURSE IMPERIAL COUNTY HAVE HIGH CASE. RATE NUMBERS AND SO IT WAS A THERE IS NOT JUST A CONCERTED EFFORT OF ADDRESSING- YOU KNOW THE EDUCATION BUT BUT EVERYTHING FROM MEDICATION P. P. ZERO UP SETTING UP ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES TO US THE QUESTIONING FOLKS TO- OF METERING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT COME IN. OUR AND UP FOR SETTING UP THIS STUFF HARVEST HOTEL FOR HARVEST WORKERS TO BE ABLE THAT TWO SEPARATE WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE CULTURE. OF THESE COMMUNITIES CULTURE THE FAMILIESIS AS A FAMILY THE STAY GATHER. AND THAT WAS ONE THE ISSUE THAT WE TO DO A LOT OF IT YOU. WHAT TRUST THE SOURCES TO BE ABLE. ADDRESS THAT SO I WILL JUST TELL YOU THAT. OVER TIME THE- MEDICAID THAT WE PUT IT. THE OPERATIVE BOTH IMPERIAL AND CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT AND DID DID. IT MAKE THE TURN- AND HELP TO ADDRESS IT BUT THE DOCTOR ARE BONDS POINTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S ONGOING AND NEEDS TO. CONTINUE TO HELP APPLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS. NO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I WAS REALLY MORE FOCUSING AND NARROWING IN ON VACCINATIONS. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE JUST HAVE. WE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. AND I THINK LIKE IN OUR LAST HEARING I THINK IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY THAT ARE BROUGHT UP THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS. YOU KNOW YEAH. YOU KNOW EXPONENTIALLY MORE UNITS MOBILE UNITS IN SOME OF THE MORE URBAN AREAS AND NOT. NOT AS MANY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY DO YOU KNOW IF THAT IS CHANGED BECAUSE I. AGAIN I THINK THE REAL. EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ON OUT REACHING GOING TO. YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE AT AND SO I YOU KNOW I. I REALLY THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR NUMBERS- ON AN EQUITY BASIS OF REACHING ALL- DEMOGRAPHICS IN IN IN THE STATE- I WILL SAY I'M GREAT PLATES I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF FANFARE ABOUT IT. I CAN TELL YOU MY COMMUNITY WE DIDN'T SEE WE HARDLY SOUGHT- I DON'T KNOW OF ANY RESTAURANTS THAT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- SO I MEAN I. I SEE HOW WHERE MAYBE IT WORKED AND IN CERTAIN AREAS BUT I DON'T. I THINK THE COMMITTEE ASKED FOR DATE ON EVERY COUNTY. AND I DON'T THINK LEAST WE STILL HAVEN'T REALLY RECEIVED THAT INFORMTION ABOUT HEY HOW HOW BROADLY WAS THIS MADE IN. AND THAT'S BEEN JUST ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I THINK- IN DEALING WITH THE GOVERNOR DURING THIS IS. WE GET SOME BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT SOME PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE. AMAZING AND I'LL TELL YOU A LOT OF PARTS OF THE STATE DON'T REALLY SEE THAT EVER ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION. THAT'S NOT TO UNDERMINE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BUT ASSIST. I YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN I SEE IT LIKE- THIS WAS EVERYWHERE AND IT WAS SO GREAT FOR ALL PARTS OF THE STATE I MEAN. WE DIDN'T SEE IT. SO AND I DO THINK IT'S- YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GET THAT DATA. NOW WHERE WAS A SAD AND EACH EACH PART OF THE STATE COUNTY BY COUNTY- AND LOOK I MEAN. AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO HAD I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE NEGATIVE I THINK THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS I WILL REITERATE THAT AGAIN BUT WE STILL HAVE TO I THINK YOU ARE. A BETTER JOB OF GETTING TO ALL PARTS OF THE STATE AND ALL DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE- AND RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS JUST GOT TO BE ON VACCINATIONS RIGHT AND ENSURING THAT- WE'RE WE'RE REALLY GETTING TO THESE POPULATIONS. MR QUICK COMMENT HAVE A ONE MORE COMMON VIA SOME VICE CHAIR CERTAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IN A KIND OF PIGGY BACKING ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER'S COMMENTS. YOU KNOW THE MOST EQUITABLE AND WE'VE SAID THIS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN-KIND OF SAYING THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE MOST EQUITABLE APPROACH. TO DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC. IS TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE VACCINATED AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT OF TIME. BECAUSE THAT COVERS EVERYBODY AND THAT'S AS MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO GET IT. AND RIGHT I AT THE BEGINNING THERE WAS A SUPPLY ISSUE AND WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE OUT WELL IT'S YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT HERE AND A LITTLE BIT THERE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY GET END OF EACH OTHER. AND IT REALLY SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN. RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING. A SUPPLIER VACCINATIONS THAT WE HAVE MORE SUPPLY THAN DEMAND PROBABLY. AND AND SO NOW IS IT IS THE TIME THAT THIS THIS OUTREACH IS SUPER IMPORTANT. BECAUSE ANYBODY HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY IF WE GIVE IT TO ARM TO GO DO THAT AND MR GALLAGHER IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND GET THAT. NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT AS OTHERS GET. THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT FALL INTO THOSE CATEGORIES- GET VACCINATED-THEY- THEY CREATE LESS EXPOSURE FOR THOSE THAT DO FALL INTO THOSE CATEGORIES. WHEN THEY'RE AT THE MARKET WHEN THEY'RE AT- WHATEVER OTHER EVENTS ARE OUT THERE- WHEN THEY'RE WALKING AROUND AT DISNEYLAND- OR OR ANY OTHER THINGS WERE MASS CROWDS GRABBED THE BEACH. SO ALL OF THAT HELPS CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT OUR MAIN GOAL HAS TO BE IN A PANDEMIC. WHICH IS GET AS MANY PEOPLE WHO WANT VACCINATIONS VACCINATED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN AT THE END WE'RE ABLE TO GATHER THOSE THAT HAD THE HESITANCY THEY WERE SLOWING THE PROCESS DOWN WE CAN LET THE PROCESS GETS SLOW DOWN LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU GUYS APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION TODAY. THANK YOU WITHOUT TO QUICK QUESTIONS REGARDING ONE REGARDING- VACCINE HESITANCY IN THE FACT THAT- ONE THING JUST CAME TO MIND MY SON ACTUALLY WORKS AT A- TESTING FACILITY DOWN IN L. A. COUNTY NEEDS TELLING ME TODAY THAT- BECAUSE THEY'RE SOLD OVER TURNOUT FOR FOLKS GETTING TESTED THAT THERE ARE CLOSE IN ONE DAY OUT OF THE WEEK SO. JUST CHRIS ARE WHAT ARE THE PLANS TO GET MORE FOLKS OUT THERE TO GET TESTED. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING REGARDING- FOLKS THAT ARE STILL HAS A TEN REGARDING VACCINES ANYTHING NEW THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS YES SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE- THE STATE IS VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TESTING. AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THAT SO WE HAVE A TESTING PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TESTING. TO THE WORK FORCE AND TO SCHOOLS. AND THEN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S- THERE'S- THERE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE RISK FOR PEOPLE BECOMING INFECTED BECAUSE THE VACCINE IS NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT. WHERE PEOPLE ARE A BY. IN THERE RIGHT NOW. POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE SO WEAK WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEE CASES OF TESTING WILL WILL CONTINUE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND. INFRASTRUCTURE YEAH THE REASON WHY THAT'S REALLY AND- IS BECAUSE OF THE VERY. WE NEED TO HAVE. ON HOW THE VIRUS IS EVOLVING. TO SEE THAT GETTING AROUND IT'S GETTING AROUND- OUR OUR OUR VACCINES OR ARE AN IMMUNITY. AND THEN THE SECOND THING ABOUT VACCINE HESITANCY- YES YOU WE ARE WE ARE THE YOU'LL SEE OVER THE COMING WEEKS. YOU'LL SEE A DOUBLING UP ON EFFORTS TO REALLY DO OUTRAGE TO THE DIFFERENT THAT. DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA. NOT JUST A CARPET CAMPAIGN BUT ALSO THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL ENTITIES. TO REALLY REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED. IT'S IT HAS TO BE VERY IT HAS TO BE VERY LOCAL YOU HAVE TO GO INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TRUSTED. TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND TRUSTED SITES WHERE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE. AND SO THAT'LL THAT'LL BE. THE EFFORT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCALS. WITH THE ANYMORE COURSE. C.
