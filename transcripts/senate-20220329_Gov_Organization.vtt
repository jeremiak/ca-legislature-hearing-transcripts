00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:34.613
EMERGENCY IS THE THREAT POSED TO

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.050
OUR DEMOCRACY BY MISINFORMATION

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.918
. A FEW SMART WRITERS HAVE SAID

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:42.888
OUR FREE SPEECH AND OUR

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.722
DEMOCRACY ARE BEING OVERWHELMED

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:47.025
BY. CHEAP SPEECH. WE'VE ALWAYS

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:48.827
HAD LIARS AND FRAUDSTERS WHO

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.496
HAVE SOUGHT TO MISINFORM AND USE

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.831
MISINFORMATION TO UNDERMINE OUR

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:55.701
DEMOCRACY. BUT IN THE INTERNET

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.804
AGE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:00.172
TWO METHODS OF SPREADING

SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SUPPORT THOSE

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:22.194

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.463
IS THAT CHEAP SPEECH HAS BECOME

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:28.300
MORE WIDESPREAD THAN FREE SPEECH

00:19:28.367 --> 00:19:29.268

ISSUE THERE'S BEEN LONG

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:58.256
DEVELOPING. I WATCHED OVER THE

00:30:58.323 --> 00:31:00.091
YEARS FOR THE LOCAL HOMETOWN

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:03.728
PAPERS DIED. I WATCHED OVER THE

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.797
YEARS WERE. EVEN LARGE

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:07.899
NEWSPAPERS LIKE THE SANTA ROSA

00:31:07.966 --> 00:31:09.734

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:26.150
ALWAYS WARY. OF GIVING MORE

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.519

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.989
PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GIVING

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:32.690

GRANTS MONEY. THESE PAPERS WILL

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:38.830
BE DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT. AND

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.999
GOVERNMENT AS A SUBTLE AND NOT

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:44.636

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:47.739

00:31:50.508 --> 00:31:51.809
DEPENDING. I BELIEVE THERE ARE

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:54.579
OTHER WAYS TO SAVE OUR HOMETOWN

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:57.382

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.552
OF- SMALL PAPERS AND SMALL

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:37.522
OUTLETS- JUST BY WAY OF

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:40.191
REFERENCE- WHEN I FIRST EMERGED

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.859
ON THE POLITICAL SCENE. IN MY

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.895
NECK OF THE WOODS THE FRESNO BEE

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.730
WAS THE DOMINANT NEWS OUTLET.

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:48.266
NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT IT BEING

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.301
COVERED EVERYTHING WAS COVERED

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:54.639
AND THEY HAD A SIGN REPORTERS-

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:56.674
IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE AREA. AND

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:59.277
AT THIS POINT- UNFORTUNATELY

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.578
IT'S GONE THROUGH THE TRANSITION

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.880

THE MCCLATCHY FAMILY OF MATERIAL

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.923
THAT IS THAT IS PRODUCED. AND SO

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:14.325

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.641
A PROPOSED TO BE FORMED. SO THE

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:07.311
FIRST IS THERE A WAY TO INCLUDE

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:10.614
OR TO CONSIDER- FOUR TWO MAYBE

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:15.553
CLARIFY. THAT THE LOCAL PAPERS.

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.688
ARE INDEED LOCAL AND COMMUNITY

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:21.625
OUTLETS BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT-

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:24.061
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE. THE

00:39:24.128 --> 00:39:25.863
LOCAL PRESS OR THE COMMUNITY

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.065
PAPER IS NOT REALLY FROM THE

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.834
COMMUNITY SO MAYBE THERE'S AN

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.235
OPPORTUNITY JUST TO ARTICULATE

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.703
THAT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.138
THAT THERE'S A GRANT COMPONENT

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.673
AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.208
THAT THOSE GRANT DOLLARS ARE

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.642
GOING TO LOCAL COMMUNITY PAPERS

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:40.644
OR MEDIA OUTLETS THAT ARE

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:41.779
SHARING LOCAL NEWS SO THAT WAS

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:44.048
JUST ONE THOUGHT AND THEN I KNOW

00:39:44.115 --> 00:39:45.783
THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:47.918
PAST AND THIS BILL. IS NOT

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.720
DEALING WITH THE SECOND ISSUE

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:51.555
THAT I'M GOING TO BRING UP. BUT

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:54.291
WE DO KNOW THAT CITIES ARE

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:57.128
REQUIRED. BY LAW TO PAY TO POST

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.563
IN PUBLIC NEWSPAPERS. AND WE

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.501
KNOW THAT. THAT PAYMENTS- IS

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:05.736
REALLY IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.738
FOR OUR LOCAL PRINT NEWSPAPERS

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.206
THAT ARE OFTENTIMES STRUGGLING

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:11.142
TO STAY IN BUSINESS. AND THEN WE

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.611
ALSO KNOW HAT THERE ARE ONLINE

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.880
OUTLETS AS WELL. AND THE LAW

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:18.082
DOES SAY PRINT NEWSPAPERS BUT IS

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.050
THERE MAY BE ALSO WAY IN SORT OF

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:22.052
HOW THIS CONTINUES TO GET FRAMED

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.454
AN ARTICULATE TO MAYBE CONSIDER

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.489
ALLOWING FOR THOSE PAPERS FOR

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.424
THOSE MDIA OUTLETS THAT HAVE

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.960
BOTH A PRINT AND ONLINE-

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:32.496
PRESENCE. THEN MAYBE ALLOW FOR

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.831
SOME OF THE POSTING TO HAPPEN

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:35.966
AND I ONLY SHARE THAT BECAUSE I

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:37.635
HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:39.370
INCREDIBLY INTERESTED IN LOCAL

00:40:39.436 --> 00:40:41.438
JOURNALISM. AND EVERY TIME

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:42.606
THERE'S A BILL THAT COMES UP

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:45.276
THAT'S ON THIS ISSUE. I GET TONS

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:48.712

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:50.714

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:20.751
SOMETHING WE ALL SEE YOU KNOW

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:23.087
THIS IS A SLOW MOTION CRASH WERE

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:25.389
ALL WATCHING IT OKAY WE SEE IT-

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:26.190
IN FRONT OF US WE KNOW HOW

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.592
IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT IS TO A

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:31.028
THRIVING DEMOCRACY WE KNOW THAT

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:33.497
THAT'S A CRUCIAL ELEMENT AND OUT

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.966
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY IT TO

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.168
SHORE UP THAT FOUNDATION. THIS

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:38.836
NOTHING'S PERFECT THIS BILL MAY

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:41.305
NOT BE PERFECT BUT WE'RE OPEN TO

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.006
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE IT

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:45.309
BETTER- WE HAVE PURPOSELY

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:46.844
CREATED A MODEL THAT DOES NOT

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:48.579
HAVE GOVERNMENT DICTATING WHO

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:51.682
GETS WHAT IF THE BUDGET WAS TO

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.884
ALLOW FUNDS TO FLOW THROUGH THIS

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:56.320
COMMITTEE SET UP TO BE APPOINTED

00:45:56.386 --> 00:46:00.057
BY PARTISAN DIVERSE- ETCETERA

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.658
AND SO THE IDEA THAT THAT

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:02.726
GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO BE

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.495
CONTROLLING THE MEDIA I THINK IS

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.763
A FALSE ONE IT'S NOT GONNA

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.133
HAPPEN UNDER THE BILL THIS AS

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:10.567
BEFORE YOU TODAY- BUT IT'S NOT A

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:11.668
PERFECT MODEL BUT IT IS A MODEL

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:13.804
THAT HAS WORKED. IN THE COUNTRY

MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK YOUR

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.237
POINT IS WELL THE BILL IS SILENT

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:28.671
AROUND THE CHARGING

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.140
INFRASTRUCTURE CLEARLY IF THE

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.576
STATE MOVES IN THIS DIRECTION IT

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:36.512
WILL HAVE TO- HAVE ASSOCIATED

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.713
WITH THAT THE CHARGING

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.949
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.851
OUR STATE FLEETS. ONCE THEY ARE

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:44.086

01:03:51.394 --> 01:03:54.030
WITNESSES IS THAT THE GOOD THING

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:56.365
OF. THE STATE LEADING BY EXAMPLE

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.668
IS THAT NUMBER ONE BECAUSE THE

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.436
STATE IN A FLEET PURCHASE BUYS A

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.471
LOT OF VEHICLES AT ONCE IT CAN

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.007

DOES SEND OUT MARKET SIGNAL TO.

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:18.120
TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN BECAUSE

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.822
IT INCREASES THE DEMAND. AND TO

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:21.691
INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.493
MODELS AS WELL AS INCREASING THE

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.263
INVESTMENT IN CHARGING WHICH
