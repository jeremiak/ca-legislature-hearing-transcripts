PROVISION THAT ALLOWS PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO DO THE SAME THING THERE AT THREE PURPOSES ONE IS TO RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE AND SACRIFICE OF SERVICE MEMBERS TO IS TO ACT ACTUALLY ISN'T AN INDUCEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO JOIN THE MILITARY AND THREE IT ALLOWS THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO HIRE VETERANS WHAT WHICH I THINK.

IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR INDEED CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS A PREFERENCE PROVISION FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS SB SIX SIX FIVE SIMPLY MODERNIZE. MODERNIZE THIS PREFERENCE TO BE USED FOR VETERANS WHO SERVED AFTER THE VIETNAM WAR. IT ALSO FAIR VETERANS BRING UNIQUE SKILL SETS THAT RENDER THEM QUALIFIED FOR THE POSITION THAT THEY SEEK EVEN IF THE RESUMES PERHAPS LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THOSE WHO TOOK A MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTE. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A TIE BETWEEN CANDIDATES IT IS NOT AN FAIR IN FAVOR THOSE WHO ELECTED TO SERVE. AND DELAY THEIR PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT CAREERS.
