AND THEN WE WILL HEAD INTO SPECIAL ORDER -- WE NOTICED THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM SO WILL BE STARTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WILL BEGIN THEN WITH THE FIRST AUTHOR THAT WE HAVE PRESENT WITH US. IN FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY THREE BY A DOCTOR EGGMAN THANK YOU. YOU CHAIR AND AN MEMBER. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN FORTY THREE TODAY WHICH Y. BELIEVES A SIMPLE BILL TO PROTECT VETERANS AND TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND ALSO A PRICING I ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- DENOUNCES ALSO PROVIDES A ROBUST HISTORY OF THE ISSUE BUT I'LL START WITH A BRIEF LITTLE RECAP IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES CONGRESS TO ACTION TO PROVIDE FOR THE REGULATION OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS TO ENSURE. POSITIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND THE PROTECTION OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT WILL FUND THEM. WHEN THE PRIMARY PIECES OF THIS WAS EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN ROLE WHICH MAKE CLEAR THAT NO MORE THAN 85% OF THE FOR PROFITS TUITION REVENUE COULD COME FROM FEDERAL AID AND FEDERALLY BACKED LOANS? WITHOUT THIS PROTECTION FOR FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY ACT AS FULLY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZED CONTRACTORS WITHOUT ANY COST CONTROLS IT TYPICALLY COME ALONG WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP. THE RULE IS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR PROFITS BY ENSURING THAT THE PROGRAM HAS VALUE ON THE OPEN MARKET AND THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN GOV THE GOVERNMENT. IS WILLING TO PAY AT LEAST 15% OF THE STUDENT'S TUITION. THE RATIO WAS EVENTUALLY WEAKENED TO THE NINETY TEN FOR TITLE FOR FEDERAL AID -- WE AND WE HAVE A SEPARATE EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN RULE FOR THE GI BILL AND VETERANS ENROLLMENT BUT THESE RATIOS DON'T AVERAGE UP TOGETHER THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY INTERSECT. SO. SAY THAT THEN THAT IT BECOMES A LEGAL FOR TO BE A 100% GOVERNMENT FUNDED WITHOUT A MANDATE A PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. TO PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT BENEFITS. THAT'S NOT THE ROLES FOR PROFITS ARE ROLLED MEMBERS AS POLICY MAKERS -- WE KNOW FROM -- FROM THE STAFF REPORT -- AND THE NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE IT NINETEEN FORTY TWENTY FOURTEEN RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THAT LINK BETWEEN FEDERALLY FUNDED AVAILABLE EIGHT AND TUITION COSTS A FOR PROFIT INSTANT INSTITUTIONS. IN FACT THESE HAVE DEFINITE CORRELATIONS THE HIGHER THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE REIMBURSED THE HIGHER THE COST GOES -- BECAUSE AS WE KNOW FOR FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS IT'S NOT ANYTHING TO JUDGE. BUT THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD MEMBERS AND NOT TO THE STUDENTS THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO FOR FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IT'S UP. TO US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT. OR THE PEOPLE AS WELL AS TAX PAYER DOLLARS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CONTAIN COSTS TO A BLANKET EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN ROLE ON TAXPAYER FUNDING. IF SCHOOLS CAN'T MAKE THAT THRESHOLD THEY CAN STILL ENROLL STUDENTS AND THEN JUST SPEND AS LITTLE AS 50% OF WHAT THEY BRING IN -- BACK ON STUDENT INSTRUCTION MONEY INTENDED FOR STUDENTS SHOULD BE GOING. FOR THOSE STUDENTS NOT JUST FOR SHAREHOLDER PROFITS -- THIS IS NOT A BILL TO CLOSE DOWN STOCKS SCHOOLS BUT BUT IT WILL WILL THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICE AND TO EVALUATE. WITH THE PRICES THEY ARE REALLY CHARGING IS FAIR TO STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS -- IF THE THEY FORFEIT THE STUDENTS ARE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE VERY HIGH LOANS THAT THEY TOOK OUT -- AND OFTENTIMES WALK AWAY WITHOUT A DEGREE AND AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS JUST TO SAY EIGHTY FIVE TO FIFTEEN OR 50% OF WHAT YOU BRING AND GOING TOWARD STUDENT INSTRUCTION -- WITH ME TODAY AT GREG HAYES AND SETH REAP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP TO TWO MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT IT. GOOD MORNING GREG HAYES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES I CABS WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IT'S A CONSORTIUM OF SIX AGENCIES AROUND CALIFORNIA THAT SERVES -- VETERANS IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. I CABS IS -- MISSION IS TO SERVE THOSE VETERANS SO THEY CAN -- THRIVE AND INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. THE PURPOSE OF THE NINETY TEN ROLE AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER A WELL ARTICULATED WAS TO ENSURE ACCURATE PRICING. WHEN TAXPAYER DOLLARS USED TO PURCHASE ITEMS OR SERVICES THE US GOVERNMENT HAS WAYS OF ENSURING WE ARE NOT OVER CHARGED PRICE MEETING IS USED WHEN CONTRACTING FOR HIGHWAYS WEAPONS ETCETERA? THE GOVERNMENT DICTATES WHAT IT'LL PAY FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURES COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID -- MEDICAID SO TO ENSURE FOR PROFIT PRICE SCHOOLS -- PRIVATE SCHOOLS PRICE TUITION AT THE MARKET VALUE RATHER THAN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT AMOUNT -- OFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE NINETY TEN ROLE WAS CREATED REQUIRING THAT AT LEAST 10% COME FROM A PRIVATE SOURCE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE TITLE FOR FUNDING. THE NINETY TEN RULE DEFINES PRIVATE -- AS TO WHICH IS NOT RECEIVED FROM TITLE FOR AND WHEN AT THE TIME TOTAL FOR WAS THE ONLY SOURCE OF FEDERAL AID WHEN THAT NINETY TEN ROLE WAS ESTABLISHED WHEN LATER CREATED THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL. AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STUDENT AID WE'RE NOT CREATED UNDER TITLE FOR SO THEREFORE LEGALLY COUNTED AS PRIVATE MONEY. VETERANS ARE TARGETED FOR THEIR OWN BENEFITS BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH VETERANS USE THEM AS THE SAME IN IN THE SAME MANNER STUDENTS DO WITH PELL GRANTS. THEY ARE COUNTED AS PRIVATE DOLLARS FOR EACH POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOLLAR THEY RECEIVE. FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS CAN LEGALLY TAKE IN NINE MORE DOLLARS IN TOTAL FOR DOLLARS. AB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE CLOSES THE LOOPHOLE BY INCLUDING VETERAN BENEFITS AS FEDERAL STUDENT AID REQUIRES THAT 15% OF PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS REVENUE FROM TUITION COME FROM AN ACTUAL PRIVATE SOURCE. THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES PROTECTIONS IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARTICULATED AND WE'D GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT SO VETERANS ARE NO LONGER TARGETED FOR THEIR DOLLARS IN AN UNFAIR MANNER. THANK YOU.

THEY TEACH EVERYTHING FROM TRUCK DRIVING COSMETOLOGY NURSING L. B. AND YOU NAME IT. ANYTHING YOU DID LAST WEEK DURING SPRING BREAK BUT HE WENT TO THE VETERINARIAN YOU WENT TO THE DENTIST YOU WENT TO THE STORE. YOU MET ONE OF OUR STUDENTS THEY WILL ALL BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL I AGREE WITH THE MEMBER OF THE BILL IS VERY SIMPLE IT CREATES AN ARBITRARY FORMULA. THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN BUCKETS OF MONEY IT DOES NOTHING IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCHOOL PERFORMANCE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GRADUATION RATES HAS NOTHING DO WITH PLACEMENT RATES IT'S SIMPLY IS AN ARBITRARY FORMULA THAT SAYS. WHERE YOUR TUITION COMES FROM HAS TO BE THESE POTS OF MONEY -- FOR INSTANCE IS SCHOOL COULD HAVE LOW TUITION AND HIGH GRADUATION RATE. SAME PROGRAM NEXT DOOR COULD HAVE HI TUITION AND LOW GRADUATION RATE THE HIGH TUITION SCHOOL WILL QUALIFY UNDER THE BILL BECAUSE THEY'LL HAVE THE MARGIN OF ERROR -- TO MEET THE EIGHTY FIVE FIFTEEN WHERE THE LOW TUITION SCHOOL WILL NOT BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTROL HOW MUCH DEBT STUDENTS COME TO OUR SCHOOL WITH WE CAN CONTROL THE TUITION. BUT IF THEY HAVE THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED UNDER FEDERAL LAW THEY COULD ACTUALLY PAY FOR A 100% OF THE PROGRAM. OR 90% -- AND AGAIN WE CAN'T CONTROL THAT BUT WE CAN CONTROL OUR STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING WITHOUT COPS ON SO WE DID A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERSHIP APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR SCHOOLS WOULD FAIL THIS FORMULA. LA -- NUMBER SAY WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AT OUR SO WELL OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE A PROGRAM AGAIN THESE STUDENTS ARE CHOOSING OUR SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU YOU SEE THEY DON'T ACCOMMODATE WITH THE STUDENTS ARE LOOKING. FOR THERE'S A REASON THEY COME TO OUR SCHOOL SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. MISTER CHAIR SCOTT GOVERNOR AFTER UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX CERTAINLY WE CONCUR WITH MISTER BACK I WOULD LIKE TO SAYS SPOKE TO THE AUTHOR AND I NOTED YOUR STAFF MEMBER THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DRAFTING ERROR. WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER -- RIGHT NOW THE BILL SUPPOSED TO BE PROSPECTIVE BUT AS DRAFT THAT IT'S HALF PERSPECTIVE AND HALF ATTRACTIVE AND HOPE YOU FIX THAT. THE OTHER THING IS THE CURRENT LAW THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS NINETY TEND TO SAY THIS IS CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE WOULD SUGGEST KEEPING THOSE NUMBERS INSTEAD WE ARE CREATING AN ENTIRELY. NEW NUMBER THAT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE SO WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONALWITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO.

THAT MIGHT BE -- HAVE SOME TO GET TO GET THE BALL BACK TO THEM BUT AGAIN ALL WE'RE SAYING IS YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE AS MUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT WILL PAY. CHARGE THAT MUCH WITHOUT HAVING SOME KIND OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT COMING IN WE KNOW VETERANS ARE TARGETED BECAUSE PEOPLE KNOW THEY COME OUT WITH MONEY AND THAT MONEY IS GONE AFTER IN VERY AGGRESSIVE WAYS -- AND IF YOU IF YOU DO MEET THAT THRESHOLD THEN JUST PUT ARE YOU CAN'T MEET THEN JUST PUT 50% RIGHT BACK INTO TEACHING STUDENTS AND NOT JUST GOING OUT TO RECRUIT MORE.

SOMEWHERE PLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU HI I'M HERE THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE IN HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH PROVIDE CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO SAFEGUARD NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THAT ARE ENROLLED ONLINE A FOR PROFIT IN OUT OF STATE ONLINE INSTITUTIONS. THE LARGEST SHARE CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED ONLINE AT SCHOOLS AND OTHER STATES ARE ENROLLED IN FOR THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES IT'S ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLE BUSINESS SECTORS IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND WE HAVE A U. NEATLY TRAGIC HISTORY WITH SUCH BUSINESSES. OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS FEDERAL CALIFORNIANS HAVE WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUT COMES THEN CALIFORNIA BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS. THE SHARE BORROWERS WHO END UP IN DEFAULT IS ALSO HIGHER AT OUT OF STATE DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS THAN IN STATE PROVIDERS. SO WE I AM BRINGING THIS BILL TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO OUR STUDENTS THAT SEEK THESE ONLINE. FOR PROFIT DEGREES FROM THESE OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TODAY TO SPEAK ON MY BILL I HAVE ANGELA PERRY A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. AND BRENDA OR RIANA FROM ERA WHO READ TAROT WHO READ A STATEMENT FROM A STUDENT WHO WORKED WHO WENT TO SCHOOL KAPLAN ONLINE. EVERY MUCH WELCOME. COME MORNING ARE ANGELA PERRY WITH TI GUESS THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS -- WELL SOME HOPE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN HELP MORE STUDENTS EARN COLLEGE DEGREES THE PROMISE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION ALSO HAS PERILS. THE CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING ACADEMIC RIGOR AND STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS CAN BE EVEN GREATER THAN IN TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OVER PRICED AND POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS LEAVING STUDENTS WITH DEBTS THEY CANNOT AFFORD. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY WITH PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF MANY LAWS DESIGNED TO PROTECT STUDENTS ENROLLED IN CALIFORNIA FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. HOWEVER THESE LAWS HAVE TRADITIONALLY ONLY APPLIED TO SCHOOLS LOCATED WITH IN CALIFORNIA NOT SCHOOLS IN ROLLING CALIFORNIANS BUT BASED ELSEWHERE. CALIFORNIA TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BY REQUIRING OUT OF STATE COLLEGES TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION AND TO PROVIDE GREATER ASSURANCES OF FINANCIAL RELIEF TO THOSE STUDENTS WHOSE PROGRAMS WERE CLOSED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE REGISTRATION SYSTEM THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS SUFFERS FROM THREE CAN'T FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS. FIRST THE STATE LACKS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO IDENTIFY RESTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. SECOND THE STATE LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO REVOKE A SCHOOLS REGISTRATION IF THE WRIST TO A STUDENT IS IDENTIFIED. AND THIRD THE SYSTEM LACKS A COMPLAINT PROCESS MEANING THAT STUDENTS HAVE NO WAY TO IDENTIFY THE ISSUES. TO THE BUREAU DIRECTLY. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO REPORT WHEN KEY OCCURRENCES TAKE PLACE THAT MIGHT SIGNAL REST TO STUDENTS. EMPOWERS THE BEER TO TAKE ACTION IF THEY DETERMINE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE AT RISK AND CREATES A COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN ONLINE PROGRAMS. THESE ARE ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL STEPS FORWARD FOR THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE AND SECOND LEVEL HI. I WANTED TO DO FOR THE REST OF THE TIME TO BRENDA -- SURRENDER JANA READING FOR SUSAN CURTIS MY NAME IS SUSAN KURT CURTIS AND I ATTENDED KAPLAN UNIVERSITY FROM ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE IN PARALEGAL STUDIES. IT WAS ALWAYS MY GOAL TO BE A COLLEGE GRADUATE AND MOVE FORWARD IN LIFE FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON I BECAME INTERESTED IN PARALEGAL STUDIES. WHILE I SERVED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT IN INSURANCE CLAIMS DEPARTMENT WHERE IT EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS LITIGATION. KATHLEEN UNIVERSITIES XCELERATED ONLINE EDUCATION WAS A BROAD STROKE APPROACH TO THE ELEMENTS OF BASIC LAW I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE CURRICULUM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA'S. MOST ENTRY LEVEL JOBS OR JUNIOR PARALEGAL OR LEGAL SECRETARIAL POSITION MY EDUCATION DID NOT MEET MOST OF THE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES REQUIRED FOR ENTRY LEVEL PARALEGAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA. KAPLAN UNIVERSITY DID NOT PERFORM ANY READING ASSESSMENT OF A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO WRITE A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LEVEL WHICH I THOUGHT SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD IN THE PARALEGAL PROFESSION. ALTHOUGH I PREVIOUS COLLEGE COURSEWORK I HAD NEVER COMPLETED IN ENGLISH COMPOSITION AT A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LEVEL I NEVER RECEIVED ANY EVALUATIONS ON ANY LEGAL WRITING. AN ANALYSIS SO I NEVER KNEW HOW STRONG I WAS IN LEGAL WRITING NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH WOULD YOU KINDLY WRAP OF YOUR COMMENTS -- AFTER TEN YEARS MY EDUCATION A CAP ON YOUR IS IT IS NOT BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE TO ITS COST LOCAL TO YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TEACHERS STUDENTS THE NECESSARY SKILLS FOR EMPLOYMENT AT A LEGAL PROFESSION.

THREE ONE THREE FOUR FIVE IT WOULD SIMPLY CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES IN CURRENT LAW RELATED TO RECRUITERS -- FOR THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES RELATED THEY'RE KICK BACKS INCENTIVES FOR SIGNING UP STUDENTS -- CURRENT LAW ONLY PREVENTS KICKBACKS BY EMPLOYEES AND DOESN'T INCLUDE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ALSO CURRENT LAW DOESN'T EXPRESSLY PREVENT KICKBACKS BASED UPON AWARDS OF FINANCIAL AID. THIS BILL ADDRESSES BOTH THESE ISSUES WE KNOW THAT ALMOST EVERY MAJOR SCANDAL RELATE TO A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE. STARTS WITH THEIR SO CALLED OUR RECRUITERS AT THESE RECRUITERS ARE REALLY JUST HIGH PRESSURE SALES PEOPLE -- PAY TO GET BODIES INTO SEATS AND WHAT'S THE IMPACT ON OUR FAMILIES OUR STUDENTS AND OUR TAXPAYERS.

THE COMMITTEE. AND THEN CHANGED THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL TO PROHIBIT COMPENSATION QUOTE RELATED TO TO RECRUITMENT ENROLLMENT AND CONTINUED ENROLLMENT. TO INSTEAD SAY CONTINGENT UPON RECRUITMENT ENROLLMENT AND CONTINUE TO GROW. THAT MEANS THE BILL NOW MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE KINDS OF COMPENSATION SITUATIONS WHERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT CONTINGENT MEANS. OR CAR OR EXIST ONLY BECAUSE OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES ABOUT US. THIS BILL AS AMENDED ON APRIL NINTH IN THE LAST COMMITTEE. ONLY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION SAYS THAT UNLESS A SALES PERSON WE'LL BE PAID CERTAINLY IS TOLD UP FRONT THAT THEY WILL BE PAID. BASED ON A PARTICULAR -- A BENCHMARK. THAT'S WHEN THE BILL APPLY. CONVERSELY IF SOMEONE AFTER THE FACT A SALES PERSON AFTER THE FACT. SIMPLY IS REWARDED FOR DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE EMPLOYER RETAINS DISCRETION FOR GIVING THAT PERSON A GOOD JOB THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY. AN EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT MOMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE POSSIBLE OVER BREADTH OF THE BILL AND CERTAINLY IF THERE.

OUR SCHOOL DON'T DO IT -- AND AND THE LAW ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA ALLOWS REGULATORS TO GO AFTER YOU IF YOU DO BUT IF THEY WANT TO MAKE THE BILL STRONGER MAKE THE LOS STRONGER WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AGAIN BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS DON'T DO IT -- SO WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN NARROW THE THEIR LANGUAGE.

THEN BACK TO FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY BY SEPTEMBER. TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COLLEAGUES APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB -- THIRTEEN FORTY LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBER AND SOMEONE ELSE THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM OVER PRICED INEFFECTIVE CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS BY REINSTATING A STATE VERSION OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE RECENTLY SCRAP BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THIS RULE WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THE ALL TOO COMMON STORY OF A STUDENT PROMISED BY RECRUITER THAT HERE SHE WILL FIND A JOB IN AN INDUSTRY. WHO TAKES OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT ONLY TO FIND UPON GRADUATING THAT NO JOBS EXIST IN THAT SPACE -- THEY FACE ASTRONOMICAL DEBT PAYMENTS OR EVEN LOAN DEFAULT. THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE APPLIED TO CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. UNDER THE RULE A PROGRAM AND I'LL MENTION NOT AN ENTIRE SCHOOL BUT AN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM. DIDN'T PASS MUSTER IF MORE THAN HALF OF ITS GRADUATES HAD AN EXCESSIVE STUDENT LOAN DEBT BURDEN WHEN WEIGHED AGAINST INCOME AFTER COLLEGE. BASED ON INITIAL DATA FROM THE FEDERAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA DID NOT PASS THIS TEST. THE SHODDY PROGRAMS GRADUATED FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO LEFT SCHOOL WITH NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. LAST YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION MOVE TO SCRAP THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE FUELING THE GROWTH THE PREDATORY SCHOOLS IN ABANDONING SAFEGUARDS THAT PROTECTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. THIS BILL WOULD REINSTATE THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE THAT WAS RECENTLY SCRAPS OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER AND WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. WITH ME IS BOB SHERMAN FROM THE CENTURY FOUNDATION AS WELL AS THERESA WAS A FORMER STUDENT FROM A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE MISTER SHERMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO MORE THAN THREE MINUTES PLEASE GOOD MORNING -- ON APRIL NINTH THEY SHARE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE I'D COMMITTEE ABOUT ATTENDING A FOR PROFIT TRADE SCHOOL. CALLED THE BROOKS INSTITUTE -- OWNED BY CAREER EDUCATION CORPORATION. I'M SORRY CAREER EDUCATION CORPORATION EXPLAIN HOW THE SCHOOL AND THEIR PREDATORY MISLEADING MARKETING PRACTICES LED TO A STUDENT LOAN BALANCE THAT HAS SINCE BALLOONED TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND HOW IT HAS AFFECTED MY LIFE. TODAY I'D LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR THAT I'M FAR FROM BEING AN OUT LIAR. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS THAT ATTENDED BROOKS AS WELL AS OTHER CC SCHOOLS. IN A RECENT SURVEY OF JUST THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FORMER BROOKS STUDENTS THEIR COMBINED FEDERAL AND PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN DEBT WAS OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. AGAIN THAT'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE STUDENTS. IN ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS THE COMMON THEME IS THAT BROOKS IN THEIR ADMISSIONS REPRESENTATIVE. LIE TO STUDENTS ABOUT JOB% PLACEMENT RATES DEBT LEVELS POST GRAD SALARIES THE TYPES OF LOANS TO STUDENTS WERE TAKING OUT. AND THE TRANSFER ABILITY OF THE CREDITS THEY AREN'T. AND THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT PARTLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE FOR THIS TYPE OF SCHOOL AT THAT TIME SO STUDENTS CAN FACT CHECK THE INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE GIVEN. I'VE GOTTEN PERMISSION FROM A FEW STUDENTS TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND TO TELL YOU HOW IT AFFECTED THEM. HI DIAN TYSON STAFFORD A COUPLE WHO ATTENDED BROOKS TOGETHER ENDED UP WITH A COMBINED TOTAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT OF NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. FORTUNATELY THEY WERE LATER ABLE TO SETTLE FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. JACQUELINE HUBBARD ANDHER HUSBAND ALSO ATTENDED TOGETHER THEIR COMBINED A IS OVER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY BOTH WORK IN FULL TIME IN FIELDS UNRELATED TO THEIR COURSE OF STUDY. TWO OF THEIR THREE CHILDREN HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS AND I CANNOT FOR THE THERAPY AND THE TUTORING THAT THEIR CHILDREN NEED. SHE'S BEEN IN UNABLE TO TRANSFER ANY OF THE CREDITS THAT SHE EARNED. LASTLY DIRTY GRAY MADE HER DECISION TO ATTEND BROOKS BASED ON INFORMATION GIVEN TO HER IN BAD FAITH BY THE SCHOOL. THAT HAS BALLOONED FROM ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE TOLD ME THAT HER APPLICATION TO BECOME A FOSTER PARENT WAS DENIED SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THIS DIRE. I COULD GO ON BUT I THINK YOU GET THE POINT WELL HUNDREDS OF FORMER BURKE STUDENTS HAVE APPLIED FOR BORROWERS DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT. DEVICE IN HER DEPARTMENT OF ED ACTIVELY SEEK TO PREVENT US FROM GAINING REDRESSED GOING SO FAR AS TO STRIP SCHOOLS LIKE BOOKS FROM THE GAME FOR EMPLOYMENT ROLE. I HOPE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL AGAIN TAKE THE LEAD AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TRUTHFUL RELIABLE INFORMATION WHEN THEY ARE CHOOSING THEIR SCHOOLS. OPTION SENIOR FELLOW AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION WHILE MANY FOR PROFIT ST STUDENTS RESPONSIBLY UNFORTUNATELY STORIES LIKE TRIPLE -- LIKE TO RACES ARE FAR TOO COMMON -- THEY USE THE HOPES OF A WELL PAYING JOB TO RECRUIT STUDENTS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPTIMISM USE GOVERNMENT LOANS TO ENROLL THEM AND THEN THE STUDENTS AND UP STOCK WOULD WITH DEBTS THEY CANNOT REPAY. AND DEBTS THAT ARE NOT DISCHARGED BOWL IN BANKRUPTCY COMMONSENSE POLICY THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT ROLE WE TRACK STUDENT DEBT YOU TRACK INCOMES AND IF MORE THAN HALF OF THE STUDENTS ARE FOR OUR HAVE UNAFFORDABLE THAT GIVEN THEIR EARNINGS. THAN THE PROGRAM HAS TO STOP IN ROLLING NEW CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

MISTER MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR HERE BEHALF AT UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX FIRST THE UNIVERSITY HAS NO PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN JEOPARDY PURSUANT TO THIS BILL. NONETHELESS I'VE WORKED WITH THE BUREAU AND ITS SUCCESSORS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THERE'S GOING TO BE A HOT SUNSET REVIEW IN. TWENTY TWENTY THERE'S A HEARING IN THE SENATE A FEW WEEKS AGO CONCERNING ONGOING COMPLAINT ISSUES THE BUREAU. I CAN SAY FOR MY CLIENT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE RECEIVE COMPLAINTS IN THE BUREAU WE RESPOND WE GET NOTHING IN RETURN THERE ARE NO CLEAR COMPLAINT PROCESS SEES IN PLACE. TO THE EXTENT THIS MEASURE WILL ADD EXPONENTIALLY TO THE BUREAU'S WORKLOAD WE SEE NO BENEFIT TO STUDENTS. IN FACT THE ANALYSIS WHAT VERY COMPREHENSIVE REFERS TO THIS AS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT'S NOT WHAT GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IS YOU ARE CREATING COMPLETE -- LISTS YOU ARE COMPARING DATA WITH EDT YOUR DOING ITS UNIFICATION IN FACT IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER WHEN THEY ELIMINATED THIS ASPECT OF G. E.. THEY WERE PORTED SAVINGS OF TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS SO YOU KNOW WE THINK THE BUREAU COULD ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO DO THIS HOWEVER LET'S WAIT FOR THE SUNSET REVIEW LET'S SEE HOW THOSE REFORMS HAVE WORKED. BEFORE WE EFFECTIVELY DOUBLE THEIR WORKLOAD WE SHOULD PUT STUDENT COMPLAINTS IN FURTHER RISK THANK YOU. BACK UP SYNC OFFERED ASSOCIATION PURPOSE SECONDARY SCHOOLS WE ALSO WERE OPPOSED -- THE DATA MATTERS AND AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA SO THE BILL SINCE THE MAYOR'S FEDERAL LAW COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL SUED THE FEDERAL LAW AND THE COURTS FOUND THAT THE ORIGINAL GAME PLAN POINT LAW HAD FLAWS. AND AND THEY BASICALLY FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE IT THIS BILL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THOSE CHANGES IT IT ADOPTS THE VERSION BEFORE THE LAWSUITS. THE EDT ONLY HAS W. TO INFORMATION IT DOES NOT HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR INFORMATION SO ANYBODY MASSAGE THERAPY PARKS COSMETOLOGY EXCEPT FOR THEIR INFORMATION WILL NOT BE AT DD THERE FOR THE BUREAU CANNOT CALCULATED -- ALSO OUT OF STATE STUDENTS SO WE DO HAVE GRADUATES ARE OUT OF STATE OR MAYBE MOVE OUT OF STATE HE DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON THEM THEREFORE OUR PROGRAMS CANNOT PASS. ALSO REGIONAL DIFFERENCES SOMEONE WORKING IN SAN FRANCISCO CERTAINLY MAKES MORE THAN SOMEONE IN BAKERSFIELD THIS DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REGIONAL DIFFERENCES SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED THANK YOU.

THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS -- BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DATA WE'VE SEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DID NOT PASS THIS TEST FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO WERE VICTIMIZED IN THE WAY THAT THERESA. WHO JUST TESTIFIED WAS VICTIMIZED AND WE NEED TO ENSURE? THAT WE REINSTATE THE ROLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS IN PLACE SO THAT WE PROTECT FUTURE STUDENTS WITH THE REST OF DATA AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO MAKE SURE THE DATA IS PUT IN PLACE I WANT JUST NOTE THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF PUT OUT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRING THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT EDUCATION.

TWO FORTY ONE BY SELLER COME LONGER DOES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL. TWO FORTY ONE AB TWO FOUR ONE WOULD REDUCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE BY REQUIRING CONTINUED MEDICAL EDUCATION COURSES TO INCLUDE. CURRICULUM ON IMPLICIT BIAS FOR LICENSEES UNDER THE MEDICAL BOARD PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOARD AND THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING. IMPLICIT BIAS THE ATTITUDES OR INTERNALIZE STEREO TYPES THAT SUB CONSCIOUSLY AFFECT OUR PERCEPTION PERCEPTIONS ACTIONS AND DECISIONS. EXISTING OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF PEOPLE BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY GENDER IDENTITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISABILITY AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS [inaudible] RACISM SEXISM ISMS DO NOT EQUAL BIAS WE ALL HAVE UNINTENDED BY A SEIZE WITHOUT REALIZING EVEN WHEN WE WISH TO TREAT PEOPLE EQUALLY. INGRAINED A STEREO TYPES CAN AFFECT OUR PERCEPTION OUR MEMORY AND OUR BEHAVIOR. IN HEALTH CARE IMPLICIT BIAS PARTICULARLY CAN THREATEN THE LIVES OF PATIENTS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS CONSTANTLY MAKE RAPID DECISIONS UNDER STRESSFUL CONDITIONS THAT MAY ALTER THE LIVES OF THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE FOLLOWING. WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN TREATED BY A FEMALE PHYSICIAN. BLACK PATIENTS OFTEN ARE PRESCRIBED LESS PAIN MEDICATION THAN WHITE PATIENTS WHO EXPRESSED THE SAME COMPLAINTS. LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANS OR QUEER AVOID DOCTORS OFFICES FOR FEAR OF DISCRIMINATION IN PROVIDER BIAS. LATINO MEANING CALIFORNIA ARE BEST TREATMENT FOR HIGH RISK LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER THAN WHITE MEN. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN ARE TWO HUNDRED AND 43% MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH RELATED CAUSES THAN WHITE WOMEN. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY STATISTICS THAT DEMONSTRATE HOW BIAS WHETHER EXPLICIT OR NOT AFFECT THE WAY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TREAT PATIENTS DIFFERENT FROM THEMSELVES. WE CANNOT JUST WAIT AND HOPE THAT THESE NUMBERS CAN IMPROVE ESPECIALLY WHEN LIVES ARE ON THE LINE. LEADERS IN MEDICINE INCLUDING THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS THE MAYO CLINIC KAISER PERMANENTE AND VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER INCREASINGLY ARE URGING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO LEARN ABOUT PERSONAL BIAS AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS BIAS THESE. IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT OFFERS EQUAL TREATMENT TO EVERYONE. OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT TO IMPROVE TREATMENT AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN UNDER SERVED BY THEIR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. AB TWO FOUR ONE TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO REDUCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE. I HAVE TWO SPEAKERS HERE TO TESTIFY DR PEARY ACKERMAN BARGER ASSISTANT CLINICAL PROFESSOR AT UC DAVIS IS BETTY IRENE MOORE SCHOOL OF NURSING AND KIMBERLY PAPPY ON ATTORNEY AND NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT ON MEDICAL LEGAL AND JUDICIAL DECISION MAKING. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. Q.. HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE VERY WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE HEALTH CARE LITERATURE THEIR PERNICIOUS AN ON GOING. SOME FURTHER EXAMPLES ARE THAT BLACK AND HISPANIC PATIENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE ANALGESIA THAN WHITE PATIENTS WHEN PRESENTING WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS. AND THIS WAS TRUE FOR BLACK AND HISPANIC CHILDREN AS WELL. LGBT PATIENTS ARE UNDER ASSESSED UNDER RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE TOPICS RELATED TO THIS COMMUNITY ARE OFTEN AVOIDED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. UNCONSCIOUS BIAS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN LEAD TO HEALTH DISPARITIES SUCH AS IN ADEQUATE TREATMENT OF CONDITIONS LIKE PAIN. OBESITY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ASTHMA AND MENTAL HEALTH. NOT ONLY DOES UNCONSCIOUS BIAS CONTRIBUTE TO UNDER TREATMENT BUT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PROVIDERS WITH MORE IMPLICIT BIASES. ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS. THIS IMPACTS THE TRUST THAT PATIENTS HAVE AN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PATIENTS WILL SEE CARE HEALTH CARE. THE PARADOX WITH UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IS THAT THE THINGS THAT DWELL IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR PERSONAL VALUES. THIS MEANS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GROUP OF BAD PROVIDERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTH DISPARITIES. RATHER IT IS LIKELY THAT IT IS A COLLECTIVE ISSUE THAT INCLUDES CARING WELL INTENTIONED PROVIDERS WHO AT TIMES. ARE MAKING HEALTHCARE DECISION BASED ON BY US RATHER THAN STANDARDIZE CARE. THIS MOST LIKELY HAPPENS WHEN PROVIDERS ARE TIRED ON CERTAIN OVERBURDENED OR HAVE MULTIPLE DEMANDS TO THEIR ATTENTION HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUS BIAS CAN BE MITIGATED [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING A CHAIR IN HIS TEAM MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME -- MY NAME IS A KIMBERLY POPPY ON AND I AM A JUDICIAL PROFESSOR WHO TEACHES ON THE NARROW SENSE OF DECISION MAKING TO JUDGES AND PHYSICIANS PRIMARILY -- WHAT WE FOUND OF THE ON TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND SIMPLY DOES IMPLICIT BIAS EXIST -- IT IS THIS. ABSOLUTELYEXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY THAT THERE ARE NARAL SCIENTIFIC COR LET'S THAT WE CAN ACTUALLYIDENTIFY THAT DETERMINE HOW DECISIONS WILL BE MADE -- AND WHAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS THEY CAN BE COMMUNICATED THROUGH TRAINING THAT WILL LOWER ONCE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS SPECIFICALLY. IT WILL CHANGE THE KNURLED PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS OF THE BRAIN SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF BIAS. AND THAT WILL LOWER SPECIFIC OF NEURAL PHYSIOLOGIC REACTIONS THAT WE HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERN ABOUT WITH POSITIONS -- IF YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS FOR INSTANCE TOWARDS AFRICAN AMERICANS THE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ACTIVATES WHEN YOU SEE A SPIDER OR SNAKE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO ACT THE WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE WHO LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE SHAQUILLE O'NEAL. THEN MET DAMON IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A POSITION WALKING INTO AN EXAMINATION ROOM AND FEELING AS IF YOU'VE JUST SEEN A SPIDER OR SNAKE WHEN YOU INTERACT WITH YOUR PATIENT. ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT THE LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS CAN PREDICT THE LEVEL OF PAIN EMPATHY PHYSIOLOGIC PAIN EMPATHY. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT YOUR POSITIONS ABILITY A. R. INSTABILITY? APA'S OR IN PEAS ABILITY TO ACTUALLY AFFECTED FLEA TREAT AND EMPATHIZE WITH PATIENTS IN THEIR TIME OF NEED THANK YOU TENS AGREEMENT -- THAT THAT TRAINING CAN SPECIFICALLY ALTER THESE BRAIN REACTIONS EFFECTIVELY AND THEREFORE INCREASE THE LEVEL OF EQUITY IN HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT SIMPLY NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO.

I KNOW IT NEVER HURTS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE ABLE TO AND NOT JUST IN OUR PRACTICE BUT I THINK IN OUR PERSONAL LIVES AND JUST HOW WE HOW WE INTERACT WITH THE WORLD. IN GENERAL TO BE ABLE TO DIG DEEP AND LOOK AT ALL OUR IMPLICIT BIAS HE'S IS IMPORTANT I JUST THINK. FOR AND HUMANITY AND FOR US TO KEEP GOING FORWARD SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE YOUR BILL. IT'S COURT THE COMMISSION AND I'M JUST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WELL FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD OUT OF YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE CUSTODY WITNESSES RESONATE FOR ME. I AM MY OWN LIVED EXPERIENCE -- I RECOGNIZE MAY NOT BE EVERY MEMBERS EXPERIENCE IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- BUT MANY OF US KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE PROVIDING EDUCATION TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS -- I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU FOR IN THIS FORM HAVE TO SECOND THE MOTION.

ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUES AND THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND FOR THE GREAT WORK OF YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF -- IMPLEMENTATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I AM RUNNING AS OF THEIR THREE BILLS AS A COMPANION -- THEIR COMPANION BILLS TO THIS THAT TALK ABOUT IMPLICIT BIAS IN AREAS WHERE ONE'S LIFE AND DEATH ARE AT STAKE -- AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL PARTIES TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION AND AND IN FACT I THINK THE FACT THAT -- IT TOO OUT OF THE THREE GROUPS THAT ARE -- TOUCHED BY THIS BILL HAVE WORKED WITH US TO ADDRESS AND WHEN TAKE IMPLEMENTATION CONCERNS ANY EITHER HAVE NOT HAD OPPOSITION OR HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION. THEIR OPPOSITION FROM THIS BILL SHOWS THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS NOT A SUGAR COATED KUN BY YA BILL BUT SOMETHING THAT IS SUBSTANTIVE -- AND THAT WILL HELP US AS A STATE A KNOWLEDGE IMPLICIT BIAS IN AREAS LIKE I SAID WHERE ONE'S LIFE OR DEATH ARE AT STAKE -- AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT POLICY AND THEN IT'S ANOTHER TO WORK WITH THE TECHNOCRATS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE AN AM AND LIMITATION IN A PROCESS THAT IS MEANINGFUL -- BUT IS ALSO A FREQUENT -- AND BENEFICIAL. WONDERFUL AT THE VERY MUCH FOR FOR ADDRESSING THAT AS YOU KNOW I HAVE SPOKEN THERE WERE SOME OF THOSE INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT YET.

REAL DIFFICULT TO SIT HERE AS A BUSINESS OWNER CALIFORNIA'S GETTING HAMMERED EVERY DAY. AND WE'RE DOWN WE LOSING SOMETHING ELEVEN THE PERSON THAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING AFTER THEM SO. I'M GONNA LAY OFF YOUR BILL TODAY AND I HOPE WE COME UP WITH SOME MEAT WAY TO GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK MARKETING AND SELLING FOR CASH. AND OUR BUSINESS OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT PAY THE TAXES WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THE OUTCOMES OF THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS IN THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE FACED WITH IS WHERE THAT TAX IS SUPPOSED TO GO. THANK YOU MISTER DYFI POINT IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN EXCELLENT ONE AND ONE THAT WERE VERY SENSITIVE TO AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT ALSO WE ARE. SEEKING A SIGNIFICANT BUDGET REVENUES TO HELP WITH ENFORCEMENT TO HELP CRACK DOWN. ON THE PLAYERS IN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND THE GRAY MARKET -- WHO ARE WE AB ALSO AGREED THAT SHOULD BE -- CONTINUING TO OPERATE SO WE HAVE A CARROT AND A STICK IT'S IT'S SORT OF A A TO TO DO ALL EFFORT -- THERE WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME -- MANY BUSINESSES WITH GOOD INTENTIONS WHO JUST CAN'T GET THROUGH THE ECONOMIC BEAR WHO WANT TO ADOPT AND EMBRACE THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE BUT NEED SOME ASSISTANCE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE IT'S NOT PERMANENT LOWERING TAXES. IT'S JUST THAT FOR THE THE BEGINNING OF A UNIQUE MARKET WHERE IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR A LONG TIME AND HAS RECENTLY BECOME LEGAL AND SO HOW DO WE HELP PEOPLE ADOPTING CHANGE -- AND TAKE ON THOSE NEW COST AT THAT COME WITH A REGULATED MARKET PLACE BUT WE WE ARE WE ARE NOT BLIND. TO THE NEED FOR ENFORCEMENT -- WE HAVE A BUDGET ASK IN THAT AREA IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US ON THAT GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT WE LOVE TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS AMERICAN HIM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE OF ONE QUESTION AND A COMMENT. AND MY QUESTION IS CAL -- COLORADO OREGON AND WASHINGTON I BELIEVE HAVE LOWER RATES THAN WE CURRENTLY DO A D. AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED THIS BECAUSE I CAME IN HALFWAY THROUGH THE PRESENTATION BUT WELL WHAT ARE THEIR TAX RATES ON A LEGAL CANNABIS RIGHT NOW. AND MAYBE ONE THE WITNESSES COULD ANSWER. THEY ARE LOWER -- IT BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY I THINK COLORADO IS AROUND -- TWELVE AT THEIR ALL OVER 10% AND SO ON AT LEAST WITH THAT THE REDUCTION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX THAT WOULD ONLY BE A TEMPORARY. ON SO THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE REDUCTION FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OKAY BUT THEY ARE THOSE THREE STATES ARE PRESENTLY HAVE LOWER RATES THAN WE HAVE. ABSENT THIS BILL. IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY. YES IT'S DEFINITELY TO RECOGNIZE THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW COMMENT WAS. WE HAVE A BLACK MARKET PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY I MEAN THAT'S ON UNDENIABLE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS ON THAT -- I DO BELIEVE LOWERING THE TAX RATE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS -- TO AND AND STUDYING IT AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE STUDY PROVISIONS LET'S LET'S WHICH WE SHOULD DO THAT MORE IN THIS BUILDING LET'S DO SOMETHING TEMPORARILY. ON A PILOT OUR TESTER TRIAL BASIS GO DO SOME RESEARCH AND FIGURE FIGURE OUT WHETHER IT'S WORKING TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE AND THAT'S THE APPROACH THIS BILL TAKES I THINK THAT'S THAT'S VERY WISE I THINK TAXATION IS PART OF THE BLACK MARKET PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK IT'S ALL OF IT I THINK THE LICENSING AND REGULATION. THE REGULATORY SCHEME IF YOU WILL -- NEEDS. TO PERHAPS BE ANALYZED TO SEE WHETHER WE'RE MAKING THAT OPTIMALLY EFFICIENT. AND I KNOW THAT'S OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE BUT YOU -- TOO NUMBERS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS SHOWN TREMENDOUS LEADERSHIP IN THIS INDUSTRY AND IT'S A POLITICALLY DICEY AND CONTROVERSIAL AREAS SO I I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. AND AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND CARRY MORE BILLS TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS BLACK MARKET PROBLEM. PLEASE BE MINDFUL OF ALSO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE REGULATORY SCHEME. AT PROP SIXTY FOUR REQUIRES AND SETS FOR CERTAIN PARAMETERS ON THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A LICENSE OR SCHEME. BUT LET'S MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR THE MOM AND POPS AND FOR THE START UPS -- SO THAT THEY CAN COME INTO THIS MARKET PLACE AND THEY'RE NOT IN ADVERT LEADER -- OR UNINTENTIONALLY PUSHED INTO INTO BLACK MARKET SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON PROUD TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM JUST TO TO YOUR YOUR EARLIER QUESTION JUST COMPARING WASHINGTON TO CALIFORNIA WASHINGTON DID HAVE A COMMERCE CULTIVATION MANUFACTURING AND RETAIL RECENTLY. SIMPLIFIED IT TO A STREET 37% EXCISE TAX AT THE POINT OF RETAIL SALE. IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT WITH ALL THE TAXES -- CUMULATIVELY LOCAL TAXES STATE EXCISE TAX CULTIVATION TAX IT'S ABOUT 45% SO AGREE THAT SOME -- STUDIES THAT CAN GUIDE US TOWARDS WHAT THAT SORT OF SWEET SPOT IS FOR THE APPROPRIATE. A TAX RATE THAT GENERATES REVENUE -- AS PEOPLE CALIFORNIA PROMISED A PROP SIXTY FOUR BUT ALLOWS THOSE BUSINESSES WITH GOOD INTENTIONS WHO WANT TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE LIGHT AND EMBRACE THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE A SIMILAR BONTA DO WISH TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SUMMER BONTA AND AS MORE LACKEY AS YOU RECALL FROM LAST YEAR OF BE PASSED THIS SIMILAR INTEGRATION OF THIS BILL. OUT OF COMMITTEE AT THE SAME TIME I DID SHARE A NUMBER OF% RESERVATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTENT OF THE BILL ITSELF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. THE LOWERING THE TAX WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT WE WE GET MORE INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE AS GOOD ACTORS AND STAMP OUT THAT OF THE BLACK MARKET. AS OF TWO AS OF MONDAY. AS THE BILL WAS BEING PRESENTED I STILL DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT REGARD THE DISTINCTION WAS THAT LAST YEAR WE GIVE THE COURTESY OF THE SUPPORT -- IN THAT INTEGRATION AND AS OF MONDAY THEN I'D ARTICULATED TO YOU THAT I WAS NOT CONFIDENT THAT THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH THE INTENT OF THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. HAVING SAID THAT -- SINCE THEN AS WE SIT HERE TODAY I GIVE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED A NUMBER OF KEY PROVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE INTENT TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD. PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AS A COMMITTEE WAS THAT OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY YOU'LL THE RESULTS OF THAT YOU'VE SUGGESTED WHICH WAS THAT YOU SUGGESTED THAT THIS BILL WOULD -- COUNTER INTUITIVELY ACTUALLY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REVENUE BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE MORE COMING FROM THE GRAY AND BLACK MARKET INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE. AND OTHER PROVISIONS THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO AND COMMITTED TO IN COMMITTEE OUTLINED THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME -- TIMELINE TO BEST ASSESS WHAT NOT THAT IN FACT IS THE CASE IN ANY CASE IN FACT IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THAT THIS PROVISION WOULD BE SUNSET IT ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF THE CULTIVATION AN EXCISE TAX WE ARE JUST A DRESSING THAT OF CULTIVATION. AND NOT ABOUT OF THE EXCISE -- AND SO THAT IS WHAT -- YOU'VE COMMITTED -- TO IN THIS COMMITTEE TODAY A WHICH IS A DIFFERENCE IS TO ALLOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS WILL NOT THIS IS ACTUALLY WORKING. AND THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE -- THIS DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION I JUST WANT TO REMIND ONLY THE AUTHOR'S BUT COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT UNFORTUNATELY JUST GIVEN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WE SEE PIECEMEAL APPROACHES TO SOLVING THIS WIDE ISSUE. WITH THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE AND I ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR VICE CHAIR -- SUMMERS -- CUNNINGHAM AND DOLLY WITH RESPECT TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN A COMPREHENSIVE FASHION THIS COMMITTEE SOL PROPOSALS TO BAN DELIVERY OF OF CANNABIS TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. SIMILE TODAY WE HAVE ENOUGH A COMPETING A MEASURE TO FOR CITIES TO ALLOW DISPENSARIES WE HAVE A PROVISION HERE WITH RESPECT TO TAXATION -- SO I WOULD JUST STATES THAT I THINK WOULD BE PRUDENT THAT WE COLLECTIVELY TAKE A LOOK AT A COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION. FOR EXAMPLE IF WE WOULD HAVE A SUNSET IN THE BUREAU OF CANVAS CONTROL TO LOOK AT A COMPREHENSIVE FASHION OF MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT ISSUE SO -- WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED EFFORTS IN THIS AND I HOPE THAT WILL TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT ARE REGULATED MARKET AND ALSO ARE GOOD ACTORS WHILE ALSO STEPPING OUT THE BLACK MARKET AS WELL TOO SO. I WITH THAT -- THIS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WITH THE COMMITMENTS THAT YOU'VE MADE IN COMMITTEE AS THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD -- SO WITH THAT COMMITTEE SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE I AM DOCTOR ADAM HOW OUR PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUT OUT YOUR MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WE ARE THE CO SPONSORS OF A. B. FOUR OH SEVEN WHICH WOULD IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS TO PERFORM FOR OSCAR P. AND IMPROVE PATIENT SAFETY. FOR HER HISORICAL PERSPECTIVE IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A RESOLUTION THAT CHARGE THE NOW DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO DEVELOP EXAMINATIONS AS APPROPRIATE TO THE PARTICULAR PROFESSIONAL DISCIPLINE WHEN YOU SOME FLORA SKIPPY. HOWEVER A QUICK REVIEW OF THE TESTAMENT CHARLES WILL SHOW YOU THAT NOT TO BE THE CASE. MORE CONCERNING HOWEVER IS A PROCESS THAT EVEN TAKES TO TAKE THE STATE MANDATED CERTIFICATION EXAM. THE TEST ITSELF MUST BE SCHEDULED A THIRD PARTY TO SIT TESTING FACILITY. YOU MUST FIRST APPLY WAIT TO RECEIVE THE STUDY GUIDE MATERIALS AND PREPARE FOR THE EXAM AND WAIT UP TO TWO MONTHS FOR THE RESULTS. ALL THE WHILE UNABLE TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED TO PERFORM THE SURGERIES WE WERE TRYING TO DO. THIS PUTS PATIENT SAFETY IN JEOPARDY. ASSEMBLY I IS FOR US TO BE FOR THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES FREQUENTLY IN THE OPERATING ROOM. REDUCING FRACTURED BONES FUSION OF JOINTS IN CERTAIN AN IMPLANT INTO THE FOOT OR ANKLE REMOVING FORM BODIES AND MORE. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE LIKELY REDUCE A FRACTURED BONE OR REALIGN A JOINT. IS THE IMPLANT CORRECT IS IT EVEN THE RIGHT SIZE. MAKING A STAB INCISION TO REMOVE A FOREIGN BODY IS ALSO MUCH EASIER IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO MAKE THE INCISION IN THE FIRST PLACE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW AND WHY FOR OSCAR P. IS CRUCIAL FOR THE OPERATING ROOM. COINCIDENTLY AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FACILITIES A CREDIT BY THE JOINT COMMISSION MUST ENSURE THAT ALL SURGEONS AND ALL PERSONNEL. PERFORM FLORA SKIPPY UNDERGO ANNUAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEM FOR OSCAR PIECE RADIATION SAFETY. AS A CONDITION OF THE ACCREDITATION. THIS TRAINING. WE'LL BE MORE GERMANE TO THE RADIATION SAFETY AND APPROPRIATE TO THE PROVIDER IN THE CLINICAL SETTING UNLIKE A KERN EXAM WHICH IS NOT SPECIALLY SPECIFIC. BUT RATHER ANTIQUATED AND QUITE FRANKLY REDUNDANT. AB FOR A SEVEN IMPROVES THIS PROCESS ALLOWS THE POSITION AND SURGEON OR DOCTOR PUT ACTOR MEDICINE TO PROVIDE FOR US COULD BE SERVICES IN A SETTING THAT IS COMPLIANT WITH THE CENTER FOR MEDICARE. AND MEDICAID SERVICES RELATED TO RADIATION SAFETY WITHOUT A PERMIT. SINCE SURGEONS ARE NOW RECEIVING THIS ADDITIONAL RADIATION SAFETY TRAINING ANNUALLY THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS SURGEONS TO USE THAT TRAIN IT TO SATISFY. CURRENT EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS REGARDING FOR OSCAR P. AND RADIATION SAFETY IN FRONT OF YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE A FOR US COULD BE IMAGE OF A RECENT SURGERY I DID. ON A SEVENTY SIX YEAR OLD. FEMALE DIABETIC PATIENT. THANK YOU KINDLY A RAPPER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WELL WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU CAN KINDLY STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION AND WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BOB BACK IN ABOUT HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF RADIOLOGISTS ARE POSITIONED SPECIALIZE IN. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING RADIATION SAFETY. WE APPRECIATE. THE SUMMONS EFFORT HERE TO MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM IN TERMS THE EFFICIENCY OF OBTAINING A PERMIT BUT WE BELIEVE IN THE PERMIT AND THE PROCESS ITSELF -- IT DOES. EMPHASIZE RADIATION DOSE FEDERATION SAFETY WAS DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AFTER A REVIEW BY THE RELIGION HEALTH BRANCH OF THE TRAIN THAT WAS GOING ON THE FIELD IT STANDARDIZES IT. MAKES THE PERMIT PORTABLE SO THE POSITIONAL PAINS THAT PERMIT CAN WORK IN MULTIPLE HOSPITALS -- WE THINK THE TEST IS A AFFECTED AND HAS BEEN UPDATED -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE PASS RATE IS 83% SO CERTAIN CERTAINLY THE TEST IS NOT AN IMPEDIMENT IN ITSELF TO OBTAIN A PERMIT. SO WE'D LIKE TO WORK ON MODERNIZING HOW YOU OBTAIN A PERMIT NOT ELIMINATING ALL TOGETHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME'S RACHEL CAMPBELL I'M A RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGIST REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS. I AM THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE FOOTBALL COLLEGE RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AT THE RADIATION PHYSICS AND EXPOSURE. CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES CD PH THROUGH THE RADIOLOGICAL BRANCHES FOR ALL PERSONS USING RADIATION ON THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA EDUCATED AND QUALIFIED. OUR REGULATIONS CURRENTLY DO JUST THAT THEY REQUIRE EVIDENCE RADIATION KNOWLEDGE TO TESTING CMS AND JOINT COMMISSION DO NOT REQUIRE INITIAL EDUCATION OR PROOF OF KNOWLEDGE. THOSE CMS NOW FOCUSING ON HIGH DO SITUATIONS EDUCATION KNOWLEDGE CAN HELP US AVOID HIGH DOSES IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE BY PROTECT YOUR PATIENTS AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS LIKE MYSELF. CMS REQUIRES ONLY THAT A LICENSEE WHO BILLS PERFORM THE PROCEDURE NATIONALLY FEW NON RADIOLOGIST PHYSICIANS HAVE CURRICULUM IN THEIR COURSE WORK TO THE PASS RATE FOR LICENSE IT'S AS LOW PROVING THE POINT THAT MORE EDUCATION IS NEEDED NOT LESS. THE FACT IS THAT AN OPERATOR WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING WILL INCREASE THE PATIENT GOES BEYOND WHAT IS REASONABLE EVEN WITH LOTUS EQUIPMENT. FOR OSCAR B. AS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD THE TOOL THAT CAN HELP DO AMAZING THINGS BUT IN THE HANDS OF AN EDUCATED CAN DO GREAT HARM SUCH AS RADIATION BURNS SEEN IN OTHER STATES. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED BY MAINTAINING THE STRICTEST RADIATION PROTECTION LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS BILL WOULD UNDO ALL OF THE GOOD THAT IS DONE BEEN DONE IN CALIFORNIA BY REMOVING THE SAFEGUARDS EDUCATION PROVIDES. THE DOCTORS IN CHARGING -- ARE MUCH LIKE THE PILOT FLYING THE PLANE THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS ESSENTIAL REGARDING THE SAFE UTILIZATION OF THE EQUIPMENT AND PROVIDING KNOWLEDGEABLE DIRECTION TO HEALTHCARE TEAM. IT WAS YOU OR A LOVED ONE IS A PATIENT ON THE TABLE WE WANT THE MOST EDUCATED AND MOST QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS OPERATING THE EQUIPMENT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS JOE BARTLETT AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND OF HEARING HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS OF CALIFORNIA. I'M A THIRD GENERATION LICENSED HEARING A DISPENSER AND I ACTIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- OUT OF CHICO CALIFORNIA OTHER PRACTICING FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF MY LICENSE. IN ADDITION A TRAINING ON MY FATHER USING THE INTERNATIONAL HEARING SOCIETY DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM AVAILABLE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO. AT THE TIME AND PASSING THE STATE EXAM TO BECOME A LICENSE HEARING A DISPENSER I'VE ALSO EARNED MY NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFICATION FROM THE NATIONAL BOARD FOR CERTIFICATION HEARING INSTRUMENT SCIENCES.

AC IS A BACCALAUREATE LEVEL COURSE PACIFIC WE DESIGNED FOR HEARING INSTRUMENTS DISPENSERS WITH TWO OR MORE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS I'VE ALSO COMPLETED HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL CONTINUING EDUCATION HOURS BY TRAIN NUMEROUS HEARING AID DISPENSERS. THIRTY DISPENSERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE HAMPERED BY THE RESTRICTION OF PERFORMING SERMON MANAGEMENT TO PUT ON THE TREE. SERVER MANAGEMENT IS THE REMOVAL OF WAX FROM THE EAR. WHEN MAKING HEARING AIDS WE OFTEN NEED TO MAKE SILICON CAST OF OUR CLIENTS HERE'S EVEN THE SLIGHTEST WAX CAN COLOR CAST TO BE MISSHAPEN? CURRENTLY MUST REFER CLIENT OUT TO THEIR DOCTOR PHYSICIAN IN ORDER TO REMOVE EXCESS EAR WAX. MANY COME BACK WITH THE SAME AMOUNT THAT WE SENT THEM AWAY WITH. WE FEEL THAT BECAUSE OUR LICENSE IN TRAINING REQUIRES THAT WE SPEND THE BULK OF OUR TIME IN THE EAR CANAL WE CAN DEMONSTRATE CORE COMPETENCIES TO BE TRAINED TO PERFORM SORT OF A MANAGEMENT. TO PUT ON THE TREE IS AN OBJECTIVE REFLEXIVE SHOULD A SCREENING TEST OF THE MIDDLE YEAR THAT IS NON INVASIVE AND IS NOT IS OFTEN PART OF BATTERY OF HEARING TESTS TO ASSESS THREE LOSS IN THE NEED FOR HEARING AID. WHEN OTHER HEARING TESTS FAILED TO YIELD CONSECUTIVAS CONCLUSIVE RESULTS TO PUT ON A TREE CAN USE A SERVICE A TIE BREAKER? UNDER THIS BILL TO BUT I'M SHE WOULD ONLY BE USED AS A SCREENING TOOL FOR PURPOSES OF REFERRING PATIENTS TO SPECIFIC YOUR NOSE AND THROAT PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. AND IN FACT HELP DETERMINE IF A CLIENT SHOULD NOT RECEIVE A HEARING AID BECAUSE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL ATTENTION COULD HELP THEIR HEARING LOSS. WE ALSO SEEK TO CODIFY FEDERALLY APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PATHWAY TO BOLSTER OUR EDUCATION STANDARDS PEOPLE WHO INTER PROFESSION MUST MOSTLY UNDERGO SOME SORT OF ON THE JOB TRAINING.

WILL MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT TWENTY TWO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR WHEN. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AB EIGHT TWO TWO WOULD ALLOW HEALTH FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS THAT AUTHORIZED THE TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF NEW BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS AND DEVICES. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT REQUIRES FULL BOTTOM IS TO USE NEEDLES TO DRAW BLOOD EVEN THOUGH NEW NEED ON THIS. NEED A LESS BLOOD COLLECTION METHODS EXIST CALIFORNIA PATIENTS DESERVE GREATER ACCESS TO NEW MEDICAL PRACTICES THAT ARE SAFE AND COMFORTABLE. I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDED TO CLARIFY THAT A FULL BOTTOM IS CANNOT INSERT OR REMOVE AN IV AND CANNOT STOP OR START AN INFUSION. WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DOCTOR P.. TO THE DEAD GONE OF A LOT OF VASCULAR AND DOCTOR FRED BROWN OF GROWTH AND HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR P. TO DUB DONE ON THE CO FOUNDER AND CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF A LOT OF VASCULAR THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY. I'M ALSO THE INVENTOR OF ARE FDA CLEARED NEEDLE FREE BLOOD DRAW TECHNOLOGY CALLED PPO. THE SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE DEVICE THE TEMPORARILY CONNECTS TO A HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS PREFER Là AB CATHETER LIKE THE ONE I HAVE DEMO TO MY HAND. NOW TO ENABLE A VIRTUALLY PAINLESS A RELIABLE BLOOD DRAW. HOSTELS AROUND THE COUNTRY INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA -- ADOPTING IV CATHETER BLOOD COLLECTION WITH PEOPLE TO IMPROVE THEIR PATIENTS EXPERIENCE AND ELIMINATE PAINFUL NEEDLE STICKS. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE TO THE PROVIDERS AND STAFF AND TO IMPROVE THEIR IMPROVE THEIR LABORATORY EFFICIENCY. THERE'S ROBUST CLINICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING BLOOD DRAWS WITH IV CATHETER ARE FROM I. B. CATHETERS WITH PEOPLE. WHICH I WON'T GO INTO ALL TODAY. IN ADDITION THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE DOES BEEN IS ABOUT TO CROSS ROUGHLY ABOUT A MILLION PROCEDURES PERFORMED TO DATE. THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED BY TRAIN PHLEBOTOMY US IN OTHER STATES. THERE BEEN ZERO ADVERSE EVENTS OVER ALL OF THOSE DROSS. AS A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE I LIKE TO SHARE -- WERE CONDUCTED BY INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTHCARE -- WHO MEASURE PEOPLE'S IMPACT ON THEIR CARE THE LARGEST HEALTH SYSTEM IN UTAH NEARBY? LIKE MOST LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM THEY RELY ON THE FULL BOTTOM IS TO COLLECT THE MAJORITY OF THEIR IMPATIENCE SAMPLES. THE ADOPTED PEOPLE SYSTEM WIDE ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. THEY TRACKED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DRAWS ON TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS CREATING THE LARGEST VASCULAR DATA SET AS FAR AS WE KNOW IN THE COUNTRY. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS DATA SAID INCLUDE NO CHANGE AN IV CATHETER REPLACEMENT RATES. OF FROM THE FULL BOTTOM STE USING PICO A 40% REDUCTION IN REJECTED SAMPLES. WHEN THEY'RE COLLECTED WITH PECO AND THEY REMOVE ROUGHLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION IN PATIENT NEEDLES FROM THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT? PATIENT SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT IN THIS NEW PROCEDURE STILL HAS NURSING CONTROL THE PATIENTS IV THERAPY. EVEN FUSION IS RUNNING THROUGH AN IV CAPITAL IN THE BLOOD IS DRAWN. BUT THE WHEN A BLOOD DRAWS REQUIRED THE PATIENT'S NURSE AND ONLY THE NURSES CAN DECIDED BRIEFLY PAUSING THAT INFUSION IS APPROPRIATE. AND IF SO THE NURSE WILL FLUSH THE IV LINE BEFORE THE PHLEBOTOMY STRAWS THE BLOOD SAMPLE WITH PEOPLE. THIS COORDINATION BETWEEN NURSING AND PHLEBOTOMY IS NOT ACTUALLY NEW AND ACTUALLY IS PRETTY STANDARD TODAY AROUND THE HOSPITAL EVEN WITH BEING A PUNCTURE. THE BOTTOM IS TO BE CLEAR WILL NEVER START STOP OR PAUSE ANY RUNNING IV INFUSION. LAST LEAVE OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE NURSES COMPLETE IN PERSON TRAINING AND DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE MAJORITY BLOOD DRAWS ARE CONDUCTED BY FULL BOTTOM THIS AND HOSPITALS. AND THIS BILL ENABLE THEM TO UTILIZE SAFER TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCEDURES MOVING FORWARD I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIRTY SECONDS LEFT.

IT STARTED OFF WITH OUR NURSES IN OUR I SEE YOU AND THEN THROUGHOUT THAT THE TIME FRAME WE'RE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR SUPPORT. TO TRANSITION TO HAVE FULL BY MISS AND TECHNICIANS CONTROL THE USE OF DRUG BLOOD DRAWS -- SO AGAIN I'M HERE IN SUPPORT AND AND AS A SUCCESSFUL USER OF ABOUT. THANK YOU I URGE YOU TO VOTE HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY IN OUR STATE CAPITOL ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEE NO ADDITIONAL WIN ASSISTANCE PART I LIKE TO CALL UP WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP HERE TO THE TABLE. AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RANT MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. I'D LIKE TO STIPULATED AT FIRST WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT DEVICE I'M AND IT'S BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND THE DEBTORS OF I HAVE GIVEN YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF HOW EFFECTIVE IT'S MAN. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THE DEVICE THIS IS ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO BE USING THE DEVICE ON THE PATIENT -- OUR CONCERN DEALING WITH THE POPULATION WHEN THEY'RE ACUITY OF THEIR DISEASE CAN BE ON THAT THE CHANGE IN IN DELIVERY OF CARE CAN BE. HARMFUL TO THEM -- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHO'S ACTUALLY USING THE DEVICE AT THE TIME THE PATIENTS BEING CARED FOR THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING A FULL BOTTOM MUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- RUPTURES AN ARTERY RUPTURES IN THE CATHETER ITSELF -- AIR IN THE CATHARINE SELF IF YOU DON'T HAVE A NURSE STANDING RIGHT THERE ARE DOING IT THEN YOU RUN THE RISK OF THAT PATIENT HAVING A AN ACUTE EPISODE -- AND NOBODY THERE IN THE MOMENTS AFTER TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH HIV THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR OUR FOLKS WHO ARE ARE IN HOSPITAL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERROR MEMBER OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE. OF THIS COURSE PLAYING G. WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION REPRESENT OVER WONDER THOUSAND REGISTERED NURSES WHO ARE OPPOSED TO AB. EIGHT TWENTY TO ASK MR RAN JUST STATED I MUST STATE THAT AS A PATIENT ADVOCATE CNA IS NOT. OPPOSED TO THIS ADVANCEMENT IN TECHNOLOGY WHICH MINIMIZES PATIENT NEEDLE STICKS HOWEVER WE DO OPPOSE THE USE OF UNLICENSED IN AND KLAY TRAINED THE BOTTOM IS TO ACCESS. INDWELLING IVY'S FOR THE PURPOSE OF WITHDRAWING BLOOD FROM PATIENTS RECEIVING INFUSION THERAPY. THIS PROCEDURE IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF A THE BOTTOM ES EMPEZAR POSES A THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. KERN EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS TO BOB PREPARE FOR BOTTOM IS FOR THE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF PERIPHERALLY INSERTED INTRAVENOUS CATHETERS. AS THE PROPONENTS -- MENTIONED THE STARTING STOPPING FLUSHING EVALUATING AND RESTORING A BY VIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DIRECT CARE REGISTERED NURSE SO WHY DO WE NEED THIS LEGISLATION. NURSES ALREADY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO MINIMIZE PATIENT NEEDLE STICKS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A REGISTERED NURSE START AND I'D BE LYING TO EVALUATE THE IV LINES STOP AND PLUS THE WIND IN HALF A MILE UP THE BOTTOM IS. ATTACHED TO CAP THEIR TO THE LINE DRAW THE BLOOD THEN HAVE THE REGISTERED NURSE FLUSTERED WE START THE LINE IF NEEDED. THIS IS A DISRUPTION A WORK FLOW. WHICH PULLS THE NURSE AWAY FROM OTHER PATIENTS THAT NEED NURSING CARE WHEN THE NURSE CAN JUST USE INTO THE NEW DEVICE HER OR HIMSELF. THIS IS A SINGLE SOURCE BILL SPONSORED BY COMPANY THAT WANTS TO PUT THESE DEVICES IN THE HANDS OF MORE HOSPITAL PERSONNEL. FOR INCREASED SALES AND PROFIT THESE DEVICES SHOULD BE USED BY LICENSE AN ATTIC LEE ADEQUATELY EDUCATED PROFESSIONALS PATIENT SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN INCREASE PROFITS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE ON AB. EIGHT TWENTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN YOUR FILIATION AGAIN.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST THOUGHT I JUST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE YOURSELF. FOR REALLY WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS AND OF COURSE WE'RE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE AMENDMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE THEY EMPHASIZE THAT MEDICAL LICENSING WITHOUT ACTUALLY -- TAKING AWAY THE RATIO AND THE EXAM LOCALITIES THAT HAD A POST PROP SIXTY FOUR A BALLOT MEASURE THAT EITHER. ONE REJECTED A RETAIL LICENSEE ORDINANCE OR TO APPROVED AN ORANGE PROHIBITING RETAIL LICENSING -- AGAIN -- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT PEOPLE THAT THE VOTERS WHO VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR HAVE ACCESS TO CANNABIS ESPECIALLY THE JURISDICTIONS THAT APPROVED IT? IF YOU LIVE IN A JURISDICTION THAT DID NOT APPROVE IT THIS WILL NOT IMPACT YOU AT ALL. RASKIN THE JURISDICTIONS THAT DID APPROVE IT TO ISSUE -- UP PERMITS FOR CANNABIS SO THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER PERMITS THOUGH EQUAL UP 225% THE LIQUOR LICENSES WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SENSIBLE SOLUTION TO ENSURE THAT THE VOTERS. THE VOTERS WILL GETS IMPLEMENTED ON PROP SIXTY FOUR AN ON CAMPUS WITH THAT HAVE A FEW -- WITNESSES TESTIFY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL ALLOW UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS ERIN AUGUSTA SOME THE FOUNDER OF THE VETERANS CANNABIS GROUP. NOW WE SEE GROUP MADE UP OF VETERANS USE MEDICAL CANNABIS WE ARE CO SPONSORING THIS BILL. AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I UNDERSTOOD ME TO THE TRANSITION FROM MILITARY LIFE TO CIVILIAN LIFE IN CANNABIS HELPED CALM ME DOWN AND BRING MY MIND INTO THE PRESENT. CANNABIS IS CRITICAL FOR VETERANS BATTLING PTSD AND CHRONIC PHYSICAL PAIN AS PART OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT WE ADVOCATE FOR AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR HELPING US TRANSITION OFF OF OPIATES. UNFORTUNATELY ALTHOUGH VOTERS PASSED PROP SIXTY FOUR IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN MORE THAN 76% OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE CANNABIS RETAIL BANDS. THIS IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN CANNABIS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE SOME VETERANS CANNOT EVEN GET CANNABIS BECAUSE THE NEAREST DELIVERY SHOP IS MORE IS TOO FAR AWAY. SEASONING FOR DRIVING. AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX WILL EXPAND BETTER ACCESS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHO RELY ON THESE TREATMENTS. THE GOVERNMENT RELIED ON THIS FOR INTELLIGENCE WHEN WE ARE ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY AND NOW WE'RE ENCOURAGING YOU AS LEGISLATORS TO LISTEN TO US NOW. ON THE FRONT OF THE BATTLE FRONT FOR PTSD AND FOR OTHER -- MEDICAL ISSUES THAT WERE FIGHTING. SO PLEASE I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS FLORENCE PERSON AND I'M AND I JUST SAYS PROVIDER FROM MERCED COUNTY. I PROVIDE HOME CARE FOR TO CLIENTS THROUGH THE STATE'S IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. I CARE FOR MY MOTHER WHO LIVES WITH SEVERE SEVERE COPD AND DIABETES AND I ALSO CARE FOR ANOTHER CLIENT WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. MY UNION UT W. REPRESENTS OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND I JUST AS PROVIDERS LIKE MYSELF. WHO CARE FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE? MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE FOUND RELIEF THROUGH THE USE OF LEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS. WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL BECAUSE WE AND OUR CLIENTS DESERVE ACCESS TO GET CANNABIS. IF IT INSURES THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE CONDITIONS FOR WHICH CANNABIS HAS A DEMONSTRATED AND EFFECTIVE MEDICAL APPLICATION. ENSURING SAFE AND CONVENIENT ACCESS FOR THEM IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. UNFORTUNATELY NOT EVERYONE HAS EASY ACCESS TO CANNABIS ALMOST DO NOT ALLOW FOR EVEN ONE CANNABIS DISPENSARIES. FOR CARE GIVER SEEKING THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF COMFORT AND DIGNITY. FOR THEIR CLIENTS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY. I'M SORRY ONE OF MY FELLOW CAR GIVERS IN PLASTER COUNTY HAS TO CLIENTS HER FATHER IS A VET WITH PTSD AND HER UNCLE LIVES WITH. SEVERE ANXIETY AND PSYCHOTIC EPISODES. THEY BOTH HAVE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH THE USE OF CANNABIS. THE PLASTIC COUNTY HAS NO DISPENSARIES. THIS IS NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF HAVING TO DRIVE FOR WAY TO OBTAIN CANNABIS. BUT ALSO THE DANGER OF LEAVING HER CLIENTS ALONE WHILE SHE IS GONE WOULD YOU CAN THE WRAP UP AND REST. IF YOU COULD KINDLY WRAP UP FOR US OKAY SO. NO ONE SHOULD BE BURDENED BY THE LACK OF ACCESS AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SIX MEANS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WHO NEED CANNABIS WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE?

SEE NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE TABLE HERE AND WILL PROVIDE UP TO THREE MINUTES. FOR TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHARLES HARVEY ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- TESTIFYING TO HERE IN OPPOSITION THE BILL IN SHORT -- IS IS VERY TROUBLING -- IT WOULD COMPLETELY A ROW THE LOCAL CONTROL OF CITIES AND COUNTIES REGULATE BRICK AND MORTAR. RETAIL CAñADA SHOPS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- FROM THE LEAST POINT OF VIEW THIS MEASURE IF PASSED WOULD SERVE AS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A BROKEN PROMISE -- TO THOSE WHO PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR TO THE BELIEF THAT LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY WOULD BE PRESERVED -- YOU KNOW MANY ALERT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME DEVELOPING DETAILED REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT PERMIT THE OPERATION OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL CANVAS BUSINESSES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE RETAIL OPERATIONS -- AND MOREOVER SOMEONE NOTED SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE ARBITRARILY SELECTED BENCHMARK OF USING THE NUMBER OF LIQUOR STORES TO DETERMINE A JURISDICTIONS RETAIL CANNABIS CONCENTRATION. SO WITH REGARD TO THE MANDATED -- ONE TO FOUR RATIO AS OUTLINED IN THE BILL -- THERE'S SIMPLY NO NEXUS BETWEEN THE CITY'S PURPORTED ISSUES ON CITIZENS -- MEDICAL CANNABIS ACCESS AND THE NUMBER OF LIQUOR STORES LOCATED IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO -- FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED ENERGY NO VOTE. GOOD MORNING CAMERON SOME WE HAVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE IN OPPOSITION -- QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS NOT AN ACCESS BILL ARE REGULATIONS ALLOW FOR DELIVERY INTO ANY JURISDICTION CURRENTLY -- AND WE BELIEVE IT IS A DISTRACTION FROM THE LICENSING PROCESSES STATE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH STATE AGENCIES TO CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR DUAL LICENSING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE THIRTY COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY. HOW WE ARE WORKING HAND IN GLOVE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FAIR AND WELL REGULATED MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS BILL FLIES IN THE FACE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WE ARE JOURNAL VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AT NOW OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TINO WHEN THIS IS IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME DR ED. THANK YOU -- WHAT IS THE RATIO WONDER FOR CALM AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED OTHER OPTIONS I GUESS IS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AND THEN -- SIXTY FOUR DEALT WITH RECREATIONAL USE AND NOW WE'RE SAYING WE'RE THIS IS FOR MEDICAL USE SO THAT'S ALSO LIKE A DISCREPANCY FOR ME AND I HAVE ONE OF MY MUNICIPALITIES -- TO THIS WOULD HAVE -- AND OF IMPACT ON SO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS FOR ME. SURE SURE WE STARTED ON WE BASED ON LIQUOR LICENSES WE WE CHOSE. A REASONABLE NUMBER RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF LIQUOR LICENSE TO JURISDICTION HAD -- WE STARTED OUT THE BILL -- FOCUSING ON RECREATIONAL AND MEDICINAL WE TOOK A MAN'S IN THE COMMITTEE TO FOCUS MORE ON MEDICINAL. OKAY WHICH MUCH DOESN'T KNOW EVERYTHING TO A PROP. SIXTY FOUR AGAIN. TO THE TIME FORTUNATE THAT THE THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES -- REALLY HAVEN'T FOR FILLED THE WILL OF THE VOTERS -- TO PROVIDE GREATER LEGAL ACCESS ON PROP -- SIXTY FOUR WE WE HAVE THE NUMBERS JUST LOOK AT IT 77% OF CITIES BAND. LOCAL STORE FRONTS 89% OF CITIES BAND MEDICAL NON STORE FROM RETAILERS THE NUMBERS JUST CONTINUE TO GET WORSE -- SO IT'S AGAIN -- SINCE. WE GOT TO COMMITTEE WE DECIDED TO THE TO COMMITMENTS. TO THE BILL SO THAT WE COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS -- CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE BOARD SINCE SIXTY FOUR HAVE HAS PASSED HAVEN'T REALLY HELPED GET US OUT THE BLACK MARKET THAT WAS REALLY THE PROMISED THAT THAT AGAIN. WAS MY CANNABIS WASN'T AVAILABLE CAMPUS IS AVAILABLE IS THAT THERE'S IT'S A HUGE BLACK MARKET SO WHAT WE WANTED WAS TO LEGALIZE IT BRING IT OUT OF THE BLACK MARKET. IN OF COURSE UNFORTUNATELY CITIES AND COUNTIES REACTED BY. HAVING ALMOST A WHOLESALE BAN. UP ALL SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I'M GONNA. KEEP WATCHING IT AS IT MOVES TOWARDS THE FLOOR SWEEPING IT'S MORE THESE THINGS RESULT AFTER FOUR ABSOLUTELY AND WE CONTINUE -- TO WANT TO WORK AND DISCUSS WHAT OPPOSITION TO TRY TO TRY TO FIND A PATH THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. BIGGEST CHAIRMAN AND HE WAS CHIANG FOR A FOR THIS LEGISLATION FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES I STILL. AM TRYING TO SUSS OUT THE DIFFERENCE SO THAT THE THE TRIGGER FOR WEATHER ON A LOCAL JURISDICTION WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK TO COLLECTIVE ACTION. ON IS WHETHER OR NOT A MAJORITY VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR WHAT WAS A WHICH WAS ABOUT A DAHLE USE OF CANNABIS. OF BUT THE LEGISLATION IN ITS CURRENT FORMATION IS AROUND MEDICINAL USE AND I'M CONFUSED ABOUT THAT THAT. CONTRAST I THINK IT'S I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- GOING THROUGH A DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMITTEE I I THINK -- THE COMMITTEE SENSE WAS THAT HE WAS BY BETTER TO MAKE THE BILL MORE NARROW. AND MAKE IT FRANKLY -- SORT OF EASIER -- TO TO ILL TO YOU KNOW WHY A WIDER VARIETY IF YOU KNOW MEMBERS SO YEAH WE WE DECIDED TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION OKAY. AND WITH REGARD TO SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN I THINK THE NARROWING ADDITIONALLY FOR COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY HAVE TAKEN THIS SORT OF VOTE -- IS APPROPRIATE -- GIVEN THAT YOUR BEARD YOUR TIME IS TO SIXTY FOUR THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE -- LOOKED AT THIS. BY PRISON POSITIVELY AND NEGATIVELY -- AND SO EXEMPTING THEM SEEMS TO MAKE A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE I DO PUSH BACK ON THE SUGGESTION THAT. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ARE EMBRACING THIS OCCURS IN IN MY COUNTY THAT ISN'T REALLY THE CASE -- I I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER OF TIME AHEAD OF OF CITIES -- IN THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE HAVE EIGHTEEN I THINK A SMALL MINORITY ACTUALLY HAVE ANY KIND OF AT THE MEET AND ABLY LEGISLATION ON IT. THE COUNTY HAS A VERY RESTRICTIVE -- LEGISLATION AROUND IT AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE ACCESS IS CERTAINLY CURTAILED BY THINK FOR JURISDICTIONS LIKE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHO STEPPED UP AND ACTUALLY PASSED AN ORDINANCE. EMILY VERY RESTRAINED -- BUT THE END RESULT IS ONE WHERE THEY'RE DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS. OF THE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS -- WHILE OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT -- AND SO THERE'S AN EQUITY HERE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS I WOULD HAVE IS THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 25% FIGURE WHICH IS A BIG CONCERN TO ME JUST ON THE TOP LINE -- FIRST OF THE 20% OF GENERAL SALES PERMIT SO IT'S NOT EVERY RESTAURANT EVERY BAR EVERY LIQUOR STORE ON EVERY GENERAL MERCHANDISE DEPARTMENT STORE THAT SELLS LIQUOR IT'S JUST LIQUOR STORES. THAT KIND OF PERMIT RIGHT TO THE PROBABLY FAR LESS THAN WHAT PEOPLE THINK CORRECT BY QUARTER LOOK THINK OF THE LAST QUARTER LIQUOR STORES IN AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF FILTERS THAT YOU'VE PUT THIS THROUGH IN ORDER RIDE IN A FINAL FIGURE SEVEN SPEAKING. WITH SOME OF THE BILL PROPONENTS BUT WE SHARED WITH ME IS IT A CITY LIKE SELANNE BEACH AND MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT HAS OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE UP WHAT HAS FORTY LIQUOR LICENSES UNDER YOUR BILL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ONLY -- ONE CAMPUS RETAIL LICENSE WOULD BE ISSUED IN A CITY OF THAT NATURE THAT THAT'S RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE THE BILL ALSO SET THE FEELING. OF ONE LICENSE PER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO WHAT WHICHEVER SMALL AND SO IT WENT AYE NEGATIVELY THEY'LL BE NEW STORIES WRITTEN ABOUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. ANYONE WHO RUSHES TO SAY 25% OF IN THE CASES LONG BEACH THE FORTY LIQUOR LICENSES -- NOT SUPER GREAT ON MATH BAG EVEN THAT WHEN I CAN DO -- FOURTEEN WE TELL LICENSES MEANS TEN DISPENSARIES OR TEN WE TELL ESTABLISHMENT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR BILL DOES IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OF THIS ONE MOST. COASTAL CITY IT WOULD BE -- ONE AGAIN INFORMATION PROVIDED ME IS THAT THE DEL MAR AND EVEN SMALLER CITY WOULD STILL JUST BE. ONE THAT'S RIGHT AND IN THAT'S IN CONTRAST TO THE ZERO THAT BOTH OF THOSE CITIES CURRENTLY HAVE WHICH COULD SEE YOUR POINT ABOUT WHO ACTUALLY IS HAVING ACCESS THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK I THINK MY CITY SAN FRANCISCO'S FACING SIMILAR -- SITUATION TO YOUR CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHERE ARE WE HAVE BEEN SORT OF EARLY ADOPTERS I'VE MISSED MEDICINAL AND RECREATIONAL UNFORTUNATELY THE SURROUNDING CITIES IN THE BAY AREA HAVEN'T REALLY FOLLOWED SUIT SO THEN. IT REALLY ENCOURAGES EVERYBODY TO COME INTO SAN FRANCISCO JUST TO PURCHASE CANNABIS AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS JUST A SLIGHTLY MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN IN THAT RESONATES FOR ME AGAIN WAS OF SHARON -- THE CITY SAN DIEGO THE CITY THE PILL BEACH I THINK OF TAKING ACTIONS BUT THAT'S TWO OF THE FIVE CITIES I REPRESENT OF THE BOUNCE OF WHICH NOT TAKEN ANY SPECIFIC ACTION AND WHILE THIS FEELS AGGRESSIVE -- I RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY SIGNIFICANT BLACK MARKET AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD STAND BY ENABLE OR ASSIST THE BLACK MARKET TO CONTINUE TO EXIST -- WHETHER THAT'S THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT UNDOUBTEDLY HAS IN YOUR DISTRICT IN MINING DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OR TO THE SAID THAT IT UNDERMINES THE WORK OF OF LEGITIMATE OPERATORS ARE GOING TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS. TO ACTUALLY TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW -- I THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE IN THE BUSINESS OF TRYING TO HELP THAT I'M NOT SURE IF THIS BILL IS PERFECT IN ITS CURRENT FORM -- BUT I CERTAINLY TRUST YOU MISTER TING TO CONTINUE TO BE A DECENT STEWARD OF OF THIS KIND OF IDEA CONTINUE TO FIND IT AGAIN LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE IN WONDER -- HOW UNNECESSARY THAT MIGHT BE -- BUT THE THE MMC TAKEN TODAY I AM I THINK OUR STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WAS WITH BILL TODAY THEY AND AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO AGAIN REFINED THE PERCENTAGE -- THE OTHER PART IS THE YOU KNOW MY PERSONAL CONCERN IS THAT IF WE DON'T SUPPORT. THE LICENSED -- LICENSED OPERATORS RIGHT NOW WE ARE POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A PERMANENT BLACK MARKET WHICH WOULD REALLY -- MOVE US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS -- THANK YOU MISTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING I APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT IT AS WAS MENTIONED SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THE DATA WE SEE QUITE A SPLIT ON NOT ONLY THE SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE OPPOSITION? THAT BEING SAID ORANGE COUNTY. HAS ALSO CHAU NGUYEN -- VERY SLOW -- LOOK AT IMPLEMENTING THIS WITH REALLY ONLY TWO CITIES COSTA MESA AND SANTA ANA I KNOW THAT DIDN'T FULLER TEN WHICH IS THE LARGEST PART OF MY DISTRICT -- THAT -- WE THERE'S BEEN NO STEPS -- TAKING AT THIS POINT AND YET THE BLACK MARKET IS WORKING. VERY ACTIVELY WORKING IN BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE -- ON THAT PUBLIC SAFETY SIDE THE ENFORCEMENT. IT JUST SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME YOU ARE. MOVING INTO A NEW LOCATION IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEY'RE POPPING UP AND IT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS FOR THEM TO CLOSE. DOWN -- OPERATION -- THAT. AND AGAIN BY THE TIME THEY CLOSE ONE DOWN YOU SEE ANOTHER -- FOUR FIVE POP UP SO THAT IT -- THE CONCERN IS THERE IS THERE USING THE SYSTEM AND AS A STATE WITH THIS LEGALIZATION ONE OF THE THE OPPORTUNITIES WAS THAT WHEN WE BROUGHT IT INTO THE FOR FRONT DOOR OUT OF THE BLACK MARKET WE WOULD START TO SEE. SOME TYPE OF REVENUE THAT WOULD. NORMALLY BE USED FOR EDUCATION BUT MANY OTHER THINGS AND SO WITH THAT I'M HOPING THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD THAT YOU'LL LOOK AT THAT THRESH FOR THE REST A SKEWS ME THRESHOLD SO THAT -- WE CAN IN FACT GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS AND GIVE THEM THE CONFIDENCE THAT WERE UNDERSTANDING BOTH SIDES. THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK -- AT THE RISK OF OVER GENERALIZING OUT WHILE YOU HAVE TO CITIES IN YOUR COUNTY THERE ARE ARE LEGALLY -- SELLING CAMPUS I WOULD. OFFER A GAS THAT EVERY SEAT AT THE YOU CAN GET CAMPUS IN ALL THE OTHER CITIES IS JUST IN THE BLACK MARKET. IN REALLY WHAT THAT HURTS SAUCES IT MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT FALLING HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HEALTH THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING WORKPLACE CODES. THERE ARE NOT FOLLOWING -- THE TAX LAWS AND CHARGING TAXES SO THEN THEY CAN CHARGE YOU KNOW X. PERCENT LAST AND THE LICENSE DISTRIBUTORS SO AGAIN. THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO CREATE AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD AND AGAIN I THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE ARE CALLING FROM SAN DIEGO SAID. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT -- YOU'RE TRYING -- TO LEADER A CITY WITH A HUGE NUMBER OF THEM BUT REALLY ASKING EVERY CITY JUST TO DO THEIR THEIR SMALL PART AS LONG AS THEY'RE THEY'RE VOTERS HAVE. HAVE AGREED WITH PROP. SIXTY FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. ACCESS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ME ESPECIALLY IN PARTICULAR WITH MEDICINAL USE. HAVE MUCH IS ALREADY BEEN SAID BY MY COLLEAGUES I CONCUR WITH THEM -- IT APPEARS LIKE THE BILL IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BASED ON AMENDMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN ALL I ASK IS CONTINUE TO WORK ESPECIALLY WITH LEGACIES IN OPPOSITION. AND DO THE REFINEMENT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO AND ALL VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY BUT WILL DEFINITELY BE WATCHFUL AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE FLOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM AT THIS TIME. SEE NO ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM CONSUMERS AT THIS TIME AS A MEMBER TING TO WHICH TO CLOSE AGAIN JUST ONE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE -- YOUR STATIC ME CHAIR AT THE THE STAFF AND ALL ALSO THE MEMBERS FOR THE GREAT QUESTIONS. JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR TING AS WE'VE SAID EARLIER IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WE HEARD A PREVIOUS BILL ON TAXATION IF FOR CANNABIS THIS IS. ANOTHER PROPOSAL TO HELP SUPPORT AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT THE REGULATED MARKET AND TO TRY AND GET MORE OF THE GOOD ACTORS. GETTING OUT OF THE GRAY AND THE BLACK MARKET -- AND AGAIN AS WE STATED BEFORE TOO THIS IS JUST% ONE APPROACH -- TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BUT AGAIN THE RECOGNITION AND CONCERNS FROM SOME MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL CONTROL OR THE ENFORCEMENT TOWARDS THE BLACK MARKET -- WE SHOULD HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO HOW WE CAN SUPPORT. OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY -- WITHIN ALL THE THE VANTAGE POINTS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A WIN THIS BILL WAS FIRST PRESENTED IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM I ALSO SHARED WITH YOU SOME SIGNIFICANT RESERVATIONS. THAT I SHARED WITH YOU -- A PRETTY GREAT RESPECT BACK TO THE CITY THAT I COME FROM THE CITY OF CAMPBELL TO WHICH VOTERS SPOKE VERY RESOUNDINGLY ON THE ISSUE. AT HAND HAVING SAID THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WITH RESPECT TO TRYING TO MAINTAIN ADDITIONAL LOCAL CONTROLS DON BUT I APPRECIATED THE RECOGNITION. OF THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FOR TO THE CAN TO CONVERSATION HAD SO THIS DOES IT ENJOYED TO PASS RECOMMENDATION THERE IS A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. MOTION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON IS THEIR SECOND.

WHEN I MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN WHICH IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE THIRTY BY DR QUIRK WITH HIM. AND AGAIN THE DOCTOR QUIRK WILL PROVIDE -- TESTIMONY UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU KAREN MEMBERS THANK YOU ALSO TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR ANALYSIS. I AB TWELVE THIRTY WOULD -- PROHIBITIVE VETERINARIAN FROM DECLINE IN ANIMAL EXCEPT FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES FOR EXAMPLE TO AMPUTATE AN INJURED CHAU. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT -- IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE ARE MANY GOOD SUGGESTIONS. OUT ONE OF THEM IN WHICH I WILL ACCEPT ONE IS NEARING THE SCOPE OF THE BELL -- FROM ALL ANIMALS TO DOMESTIC CATS ONLY NOTED NOTABLY THIS WOULD ALLOW VETERINARIANS. TO FOR EXAMPLE CONTINUE REMOVING THE DEW CLAWS ON DOGS -- SECOND CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF DECLINE BY ENUMERATING SPECIFIC -- SURGICAL PROCEDURES AND ALSO CLARIFYING AND THAT THE VETERINARIAN MEDICAL BOARD WOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF DISCRETION IN DETERMINING WHAT TO DO IF SOMEONE WERE TO VIOLATE THE BAN. OF THE SPECIFIC AMENDMENT LANGUAGE PROVIDING ON PAGE SIX IN THE ANALYSIS WOULD REPLACE THE CONTENTS THE BILL WITH AN INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENT. HOWEVER THIS IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT OF THE VETERINARY ASSOCIATION -- THERE FOR THE BILL WOULD DO NOTHING -- IN ADDITION THE PARTICULAR -- DECLARATION THAT'S ASK FOR THERE IS ACTUALLY OUT OF DATE. THE AMERICAN VETERINARY SOCIETY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A NEW -- DECLARATION. OF INFORMED CONSENT TO REFLECT MODERN -- RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE HARM DONE TO CATS -- SAYS SCRATCHING IS A NORMAL FELINE BEHAVIOR THAT MAY BE MANAGED BY PROVIDING SCRATCHING POLLS TRIMMING CLAUSE. OR PROVIDING -- SOFT SYNTHETIC NOW CAPS. ARE IN DECLINE IS MORE THAN JUST REMOVING THE NAIL IT'S ACTUALLY THE AMPUTATION OF THE LAST BONE OF THE CAPS TOES. IN HUMANS IS WHO PRIVILEGE OF AMPUTATING ALL FINGER TIPS AND OFTEN CHOSE FROM THE FIRST KNUCKLE. THEREFORE THE VETERINARIAN PROFESSION IN MANY COUNTRIES CONSIDER CACTUS DECLINE MUTILATION WHEN CARRIED OUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF AN ANIMAL'S OWNER. RATHER THAN THE BENEFIT OF AN ANIMAL. SHOULD A VETERINARIAN IN IRELAND FOR EXAMPLE PERFORM THIS PROCEDURE FOR ANY REASON THE VETERINARIAN WOULD FACE DISCIPLINARY ACTION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THEIR LICENSE REVOKED -- IN A LAND THAT IT'S ACROSS EUROPE IN THE U. K. AT CETERA -- THAT THIS IS BEEN BANNED. IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD INCHES ME IN NORTH AMERICA DECLINE IS ALREADY BANNED IN A CALIFORNIA CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA. WEST HOLLYWOOD IN CANADA THE VETERINARY ASSOCIATION OF SIX PROVINCES HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF THIS ISSUE. BY VOTING THAT THEIR MEMBERS WILL NO LONGER PERFORM DECLINE. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE DECLAWING CATS IS. BAD FOR CATS. IN THE JOURNAL OF FELINE. MEDICINE AND SURGERY THERE'S A RECENT ARTICLE BY -- DOCTOR MORAN -- WHICH IS LOOKED AT THREE HUNDRED CATS AND LOOKED AT KAT CITY BEEN DE CLAWED AND CATS THAT HADN'T. THOSE CATS THAT HAD BEEN DE CLAWED WERE MUCH LIKELY TO HAVE BAD BEHAVIORS. SUCH AS URINATION OUTSIDE THE LITTER BOX BECAUSE OF PAIN WHEN DIGGING. LOSS OF HAIR TO DO EXCESSIVE GROOMING THE EQUIVALENT OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER BACK PAIN. BITING AND AGGRESSIVENESS -- DOCTOR JUST WILD ON THE FAR LEFT HERE HAS ADOPTED. ARE TWO KITTENS THERE WERE TWO CATS THAT WERE DE CLAWED. THE FIRST WAS A MALE THAT HAD BEEN DE CLAWED WENT TO A PUBLIC. SHELTER BECAUSE OF YOUR URINATING OUTSIDE THE LITTER BOX. HAD HE NOT BEEN ADOPTED HE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A FEW DAYS. DENNY WAS PULLED FROM THE SHELTER. BY DR GENS FAULT. AND DOCTOR JANICE FAULT TOOK HIM INTO HIS HOME AND FOUND THAT IF YOU USE. A CARDBOARD BOX THAT THE ANIMAL WOULD URINATE IN THAT AND WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE ANIMAL FOR MANY YEARS. THROUGH ITS NORMAL LIFE. THE SECOND WAS A FEMALE WHO HAD BEEN DE CLAWED AS A KITTEN. THE CAB AS IT GREW OLDER BECAME ON PREDICTABLY AGGRESSIVE IN WOULD BITE AT THE SLIGHTEST PROVOCATION. WITH THE INTERNET COULD NOT DEAL WITH CATS MATERIAL CAMPER -- DOCTOR JANICE FALL TOOK THE CAT INTO ITS OWN HOME. AND RAISED IT. BOTH OF THESE CATS HAD BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE FOUND MORE OFTEN AND DECRIED CLASS HE'S ME. DECLAWED CATS. AND BOTH CATS CAME CLOSE TO BEING KILLED DUTY AND TOLERANCE OF THESE BEHAVIORS. IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO BE UP HERE CALLING FOR AN END TO THIS PRACTICE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO HURT AN ANIMAL THEN SAVE IT. GIVEN ALL THAT IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CITIES BANNING DECLINE OF SEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CATS RELINQUISH TO SHELTERS SINCE THEIR BANDS WHEN INTO A FACT THAT TO DECREASE. IN THOSE THAT ARE REFERRED TO SHELTERS. WELL SOME VETERINARIANS BELIEVE THAT YOU MEAN HEALTH ISSUES NEW TEST YET NECESSITATE DECLINE THIS IS INCORRECT -- WE HAVE IN FACT TESTIMONY FROM THE HEM APHELIA COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA. BOTTOM LINE HAVE A FEEL HE IS NOT A REASONS TO CLAW YOUR CAT. WE HAVE A LETTER FROM A HAM APHELIA. SHE'S ME. HAMMER MYCOLOGICAL ONCOLOGIST SAYING THAT [inaudible] HE HAS. PATIENTS WHO ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS HE HAS PATIENTS WHO HAVE. POOR IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND YET HE WOULD NEVER. ASK THE CATS BE CLAWED BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY NOT AN ISSUE. WHEN I'VE TALKED TO THE VETERINARIANS THEIR MAIN REASON? FOR ALLOWING THIS IS THE FACT THAT IT HELPS HUMAN HEALTH FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FACT HAVE A PHILLY ACTS OR ON BLOOD THINNERS. AND IN FACT. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ACCORDING TO THE HUMAN DOCTORS. FURTHERMORE. IF THE CAT CANNOT SCRATCH IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BUY THIS LEADS TO INFECTION -- WHICH CAN'T FAT CAT SCRATCHES REALLY DO. THUS THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL DOES NOT RECOMMEND PEOPLE WITH COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM SUCH AS HIV DE CLAWED THEIR CATS. DOCTORS WHO TREAT THEIR YOUTH THESE PATIENT POP POPULATIONS WAITED TO SAY THEY HAVE NEVER RECOMMENDED THAT THEIR PATIENTS TO CLAW THEIR CAPS. NOR SEEN FACE ANY HEALTH PROBLEMS DUE TO CAT SCRATCHES. FINALLY. WE ASKED A DISCIPLINE A DISABILITY ADVOCATE ORGANIZATION WHETHER CLAUSE CAN HARM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISABLED PERSON AN ARTISTIC PERSON IN THEIR CAT. THERE WAS RESPONSE WAS TO REGISTER FORMAL SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE. WHAT SOME VETERINARIANS ALREADY DECLINED O THE CLOCK CATS OTHERS DO IT RARELY? OFFER TOO MANY THOUGH DECLINE IS STILL A ROUTINE PROCEDURE -- WE HAVE DATA SHOWING THAT UP IN SOME CASES UP 220% OF CAPTURE THE CLOT. I HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THESE MEASURES -- DOCTOR JUST JAZZ. JAZZ WORLD IS NOT GOING TO TESTIFY BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS THROAT BUT I'VE GIVEN YOU IS BOUGHT. POINTS DIRECTOR JENNIFER CONRAD THE FOUNDER AND DIRECTOR THAT. BOB PROJECT AND BRENDA BARNETT GENERAL MANAGER OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF AN ANIMAL SERVICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WELCOME. I'M THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER CONRAD I'M A VETERINARIAN AND I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW. THAT THERE'S A REASON THAT WE BROUGHT THIS FORWARD IT'S A CRUEL THING TO DO TO ANIMALS I HAVE REPAIRED THE PAWS OF BIG CATS AND LITTLE CATS WHO HAVE BEEN DE CLAWED AND WHEN I GET A CALL. FROM THE OWNER WHO HAS DE KLERK WHO HAS A CAT HE'S NOT USING THE LITTER BOX OR WHO IS BITING MY STAFF 1100% OF THE TIME SAYS WHEN WAS THAT CAT DECLAWED I YOU. VETERINARIANS ARE USING A SURGERY TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOR PROBLEM. IN HUMAN MEDICINE THAT WENT OUT WITH LOBOTOMY. INFORMED CONSENT DOES NOTHING IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GET A NEW APP ON YOUR PHONE AND YOU SAY I AGREE NO ONE'S READ THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO PROTECT CATS. I RESPECT. TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MATT IS BRENDA BARNETT I AM THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LA ANIMAL SERVICES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU BRIEFLY THIS MORNING. I WANT IS JUST MENTION THAT IN THE FIVE YEARS BEFORE WE PASSED THE DEFAULT BAN IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE HAD TWENTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO CAPS ADULT CAT OWNER SURRENDERED. FIVE YEARS AFTER THE BAND WE HAD HAD FIFTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX WE'RE A DATA DRIVEN. ORGANIZATION THAT WAS A FORTY THREE POINT 3% DECLINE IN OWNER SURRENDERS -- ONCE WE WERE NOT DECLINE CATS IN THE CITY. I ALSO WANTED TO JUST MENTION THE CHALLENGE AND THE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING CATS THAT ARE NOT DIG CALLED WITH PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD SEVERELY AUTISTIC GRANDSON HE HAS NEVER NOT HAD A CAT IN HIS HAND AND THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DE CLAWED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD DO WITHOUT AS KITTENS. NOW I THINK -- THE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS THAT I'VE SAME FROM FRIENDS. FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURRENDERED THEIR CATS URINATING OUTSIDE THE LITTER BOX IT'S A TERRIBLE PROBLEM TO HAVE IT'S ONE I HAD A FRIEND WHO HAD A CAT WHO'D BEEN DEFAULT. DO ANYTHING SHE COULD DO IS EVERY FEW YEARS SELL HER CONDUCT TO THEY COULD RIP OUT THE CARPET AND MOVED TO A NEW CONDUCT SHE WAS THAT COMMITTED TO OUR CAT NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE. THE OTHER THING IS THE BITING NO ONE WANTS A CAT HE JUST BITES. THIS IS AN IN HUMANE THING TO DO TO CATS AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT STOPPING THIS PRACTICE AND FOR US IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE CATS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. GARY COOPER WORKING WITH THE POWER PROJECT IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT DEAL REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE OF WITH ME HERE IS DOCTOR CAN PLOW SKI IF YOU HAVE ANY MEDICAL QUESTIONS WHEN I FINISH HERE. THIS IS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE FOR VETERINARIANS AND TO BE HONEST IT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN ABOUT THE SURGERY ITSELF BUT THE ISSUE OF PRECEDENT. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PUT SOMETHING IN THE VETERINARY PRACTICE ACT -- AND CALL IT AN UNLAWFUL PROCEDURE AND THEN WE ASK A WHERE DOES IT END THERE ARE SOME SMALL GROUPS -- THAT WISH TO BAN A RABIES VACCINATIONS THERE ARE SOME OTHER GROUPS THAT WOULD -- BAND SPAYING AND NEUTERING SO AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE PROCEDURES DONE FAR LESS TODAY THAN IT WAS EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. AS A NUMBER OF VETERINARIANS HAVE TOLD US WE DIDN'T GO TO ALL THOSE YEARS OF LAW SCHOOL TO HARM ANIMALS -- WE THINK THAT -- PUTTING INFORMED CONSENT -- IN THE MEASURE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- TO DIET DOCTOR QUIRK OF THE VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAVE SOME GUIDELINES BUT ARE THERE NO REQUIREMENTS SOME VETERINARIANS USE THOSE -- BUT WE THINK BY PUTTING IT INTO LAW AND THEN PUTTING IN THE CLIENT'S FILE -- WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JUST AS THE FROM AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD WE REGULATE THE LARGEST POPULATION OF VETERINARIANS IN THE NATION AND OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ANIMALS. BY REGULATING LICENSING LICENSEES PROMOTING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS AND DILIGENTLY AND FORCING THE BY NAME AND MEDICINE. PRACTICE ACT. AND IS ABLE SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEETING THE VENDOR MEDICAL BOARD AND THE PUBLIC CONDUCTED A LENGTHY DELIBERATION REGARDING THE PROVISIONS I'VE BEEN CONCERNS WITH AB. TWELVE THIRTY RESPECTFULLY THE BOARD IS TAKEN IN OPPOSITION. TO AB TWELVE THIRTY THE BOARD IS CURRENTLY ABLE AND DOES TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST VETERINARIANS FOR NEGLIGENT AND INCOMPETENT HACKS. SHOULD SOMETHING GO WRONG DURING THE PROCEDURE AN ANIMAL IS HARM THE BOARD'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS GRANTED BY THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS FOR ANIMAL PATIENTS IN THEIR OWNERS. AS STATED IN OUR LETTER THE BOARD MEMBERS IN GENERAL AGREE THAT DECLINE SHOULD NOT BE A PROCEDURE PERFORMED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE ANIMAL PATIENT. HOWEVER THAT DETERMINATION IS BEST LEFT TO THE VETERINARY AND THE ANIMAL OWNER. IN ADDITION CONCERNS WERE RAISED THAT PROHIBITING THE CALL PROCEDURES WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT. THE ABILITY OF CAST TO EITHER STAY IN EXISTING HOMES OR BE ADOPTED INTO A NEW HOME. CONCERN HAS WAS ALSO REYES REGARDING BACK ALLEY PROCEDURES WERE WHERE ANIMAL OWNERS WILL ATTEMPT TO DO CALL THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES. WELL THE BOARD IS NOT DISCUSS THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE NOW SAYS I DO BELIEVE THE ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS RAISED ANTICIPATED FOR SUPPORTING THEM TO THE GO THROUGH. TEN SECONDS LEFT. HM -- SO MY EXPERIENCE -- IS THAT THESE BECAUSE CATS CAN LIVE WITH IT EXCELLENT LIFE AND THERE WAS A SURVEY OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE OWNERS AND I'M SORRY I CAN'T NAME INFORMATION PLEASE SORRY I'M SURE WATER HOUSE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BETTER MEDICAL BOARD LOCATE AND SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION. AND SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION VERY MUCH OUR TIME IS UP FOR THE THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION SO NOW GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEE NO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. I DO NOT SEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM KEY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME AFTER COURT DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE -- YES -- SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT I HAVE. SO MOST KNOWN HERE. NOT WHAT I HAVE IS A MEDICAL STUDY. IN THE JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY. LOOKING AT THREE HUNDRED CATS SHOWING THE ADVERSE IMPACTS FURTHER. WELL YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE VETERINARIAN HERE THAT THIS IS A WAY TO KEEP CATS IN THEIR HOME -- THIS IS NOT A WAY TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOME AS YOU HEARD FROM MY WITNESS. THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES IF THEY'RE NOT DE CLAWED WE FIND THIS -- IN THE CITIES AND WHERE DECLINE HAS BEEN OUTLAWED [inaudible] SO. THE OTHER THING IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT IF WE DO THIS AND I GOT A BAND VACCINATIONS THE ANSWERS NOW -- WE'RE ALWAYS PRESENTED WITH THE IDEA OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE BUT IN FACT. WE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS WE HAVE TO DRAW LINES WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME. AS JOB [inaudible] LEGISLATORS. I'M PRESENTING THAT THIS HARMS CATS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE.

ONE I THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIFTEEN SIXTY FIVE WILL ALLOW KITTENS TO BE MADE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION. TWO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WAVING THE THREE DAY HOLD PERIOD. CURRENT LAWS ALLOWS FOR THE IMMEDIATE EUTHANASIA OF UNCLEAN KITTENS AT AND SHELTER WITHOUT THEIR MOTHER. ONE REASON FOR THIS IS THE KITTENS ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO CONTAGIOUS DISEASES DUE TO THEIR IMMATURE IMMUNE SYSTEMS AND CAN EASILY CONTRACT AN ILLNESS. THIS TICKET WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME ATTENTION AND RESOURCES CARE FOR AND BECOME A DRAIN ON THE SHELTER. IF KITTENS CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELTER TO A HOME WITH GREATER CAPACITY TO MANAGE THE HIGHER MAINTENANCE NEEDS. THEY HAVE A MUCH GREATER CHANCE OF A POSITIVE OUTCOME. AND I WILL SAY THAT I'VE HAD FRIENDS DOING THIS YOU CAN DO THIS IF YOU'RE PART OF A LOCAL NONPROFIT. LIKE A ANIMAL PROTECTION -- ANIMAL WELFARE ORGANIZATION WHAT YOU CAN'T DO AND WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE. JUST VOLUNTEERS TO DO IT. SO THAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS BILL WITH ME TODAY ISSUES AND RAKES WITH THE ASPCA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THIS DOES ENJOY DO PASS RECOMMENDATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT. BOOK RIGHT THANK YOU ALL THE ALL THE BRIEF THAN A SUSAN RIGS WITH THE ASPCA THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND ON THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD REALLY ADDS TO YOU -- THESE IMPLEMENT MEMBERS -- POINTS IS THAT YOU OFTENTIMES THESE KITTENS ARE COMING FROM LITERALLY THE BUSHES OR SOMEONE'S BACKYARD THERE ARE PART OF A CAT COLONY FERAL.

WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE PASSED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TOOLS FOR GETTING MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. THANK YOU UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THINGS WE HAVE FOUND THAT UP GOES TO TAX PREPARERS. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ASK THE TAX PREPARERS. TO MAKE CLEAR UP FRONT WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE. AND SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN MAKE. A REAL CHOICE THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE DIVIDER PROGRAMS WHERE. OUR CONSTITUENTS CAN GET FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICES AND NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FEES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO INTO THOSE TRANSACTIONS KNOWING WHAT'S AT STAKE BECAUSE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THOSE THE ITC PAYMENTS GO INTO THE POCKETS OF THE FAMILIES WHO.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SOLANO RICE AND ON BEHALF OF PROSPERITY NOW I SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FORTY INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THIS BILL I CREATE STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR TAXPAYERS IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURING THAT LOW INCOME WORKING TAXPAYERS RECEIVE THE FULL BENEFITS. OF BOTH THE CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IN A TIME WHEN OUR STATE IS LOOKING TO EXPAND THE SUPPORT OF FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T RISK HAVING TAX REFUNDS ARE ROUTED BY HIGH COST OR PREDATORY PAID TAX PREPARATION SERVICES. I IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ESTIMATED THAT AS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE THANK AT TAXPAYERS. PAID TAX PREPARERS RAKED IN ABOUT SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS JUST LAST YEAR. I HAD THE CLEAR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS BILL WILL GIVE TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA REAL CHOICE BY HIGHLIGHTING IN PLAIN LANGUAGE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH SPANISH CHINESE TAGALOG VIETNAMESE AND KOREAN. THAT THEY CAN HAVE THEIR TO RETURN PREPARED BY A PAID PREPARE KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH THEY'LL PAY AND COSTS AND FEES RIGHT AWAY. SOMETHING ALREADY DONE BY H. AND R. BLOCK ONE OF THE LARGEST TAX PREPARATION OUTLETS OUTLETS CHAINS OR THAT THEY CAN TURN TO A LOCAL VITA PROGRAM. WELL THEY'LL HAVE THEIR RETURN PREPARED ACCURATELY AND ENTIRELY FOR FREE. AND ACTING CLEAR DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS ON TAX PREPARATION WILL STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S TAX PREPARER REGULATIONS WHILE ENSURING THE STATE'S. INVESTMENT TOWARD BUILDING FINANCIAL SECURITY WEALTH AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL FAMILIES AND NOT PAID TAX REPAIRS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR.

PUT SOME ON UNFAIR BURDEN ON TAX PREPARERS. AND THIS COSTS WOULD PROBABLY BE PASSED ON TO THE CLIENT -- WHY MOST OF OUR TAX PREPARERS HAVE FEES POSTED? ARE AVAILABLE. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE. TO TELL THEM EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE TAX RETURN. IS GOING TO COST BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHAT SURPRISES MIGHT COME UP. SOMEBODY COMES IN AND HAS EVERYTHING ITEMIZED TOTALED CLEAN. NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION OTHER PEOPLE COME IN WITH BOXES OR BAGS. AND WE HAVE TO WALK FURTHER THROUGH IT.

AS I'M SURE YOU MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF NURSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY HEALTH IMPACT 85% OF HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED DEMAND. FOR NURSES BEING GREATLY OKAY BEING GREATER THAN THE SUPPLY. THE SAME REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN BEHIND THE NET NATIONAL AVERAGE OF NURSING PER NURSES PER CAPITA. THIS HIGH DEMAND OF NURSES IS LIKELY TO BE FURTHER INTENSIFIED BY THE DECREASING NUMBER OF UNINSURED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS THE HIGH GROWTH RATE OF SENIOR POPULATION WE ALL KNOW IT IS A SILVER TSUNAMI -- THE PEER REVIEW JOURNAL AMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL QUALITY RECENTLY REPORTED. THE NURSING SHORTAGE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW BY TWENTY THIRTY THE REPORT ESTIMATES A SHORTAGE OF OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND NURSES. AT THE SAME TIME OF OF HIGH DEMAND FOR NURSES ANY PROJECTED NURSING WORKFORCE DISPARITY. THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAS EXTREMELY LIMITED ENROLLMENT ON NURSING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT STUDENTS SEEKING A MOMENT IN THE NURSING PROGRAM ARE FORCED TO WAIT FOR UNPREDICTABLE AMOUNTS OF TIMES ON WAIT LIST OR PROGRAMS ARE FORCED. TO DENY THE ENROLLMENT ALL TOGETHER. NOT ONLY DOES THIS DISCOURAGE STUDENTS FROM EVEN APPLYING TO NURSING SCHOOLS IT ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE REASONS WHY IT IS SO CRITICAL TO ACT NOW AND ENSURE CALIFORNIA IS TAKING EVERY STEP TO EXPAND THE NURSING WORKFORCE. AND AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THIS BILL WILL EXEMPT BEER ARE AN APPROVED NURSING PROGRAMS THAT MAINTAIN A HIGH PASS RATE ON THE STATE LICENSING EXAM AND ARE PART PROBLEM OUT PAGA MATT. I CAN'T SEE THE WORD. PROGRAMS ARE ACCREDITED BY IN NURSING ACCREDITING AGENCY FROM ADDITIONAL B. R. AND REGULATIONS AND OVERSIGHT INCLUDING ENROLLMENT CAPS AND FACULTY APPROVAL. THE ABILITY TO USE UP 250% OF SIMULATION BASED LEARNING AND THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN NURSING PROGRAMS AND CLIENT OF CLINICAL FACILITIES.

YOU TO DEVELOP A PRE LICENSURE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING DEGREE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE STATE'S GROWING NURSING SHORTAGE. OVER THIS PAST DECADE WE'VE GRADUATED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY B. S. AND NURSES FAR BELOW OUR CAPACITY. DUE TO REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WG WAS ONLY PERMITTED TO ADMIT FORTY NEW STUDENTS JUST 2% OF ALL QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. OUR PRE LICENSURE OF OUR PRE LICENSURE GRADUATE 61% ARE FROM ETHNIC ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. 44% ARE MEN AND THE AVERAGE AGE IS THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD. OUR FIRST TIME LICENSING EXAM PASS RATES THE AND CLICK SEE EXAMINE CALIFORNIA'S 97%. AS COMPARED WITH THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR LIKE PROGRAMS THAT SO TUITION AND FEES FOR OUR PRE LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM IS LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TOTAL. W. CHOOSE ABILITY TO FULFILL OUR MISSION SIR CALIFORNIANS STRANDED LEARNERS. AND ALLEVIATE THE STATE'S NURSING SHORTAGE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY HINDER DUE TO THE DUPLICATIVE ONEROUS AND EVEN PUNITIVE.

CHAIRMAN LOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICOLE SRB I AM A GRADUATING SENIOR AT WEST COAST UNIVERSITY AND I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR MY FAMILY IMMIGRATED FROM AFGHANISTAN AND I WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN I BECAME A UNITED STATES CITIZEN. THE DAY I BECAME AN AMERICAN WAS AN INCREDIBLE DAY YET AT TEN YEARS OLD I WAS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE TRULY UNDERSTOOD. THE GRAVITY OF THAT MOMENT OR EVERYTHING MY PARENTS HAD SACRIFICE IN ORDER TO GRANT ME FULL FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY. AS YEARS PASSED I BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT BEING AN AMERICAN MEANT THAT MY RACE MY GENDER MY RELIGION MY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS NONE OF THESE THINGS SHOULD PLACE A BARRIER OVER MY ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. YET THESE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTHS WERE CHALLENGED WHEN I BEGAN PURSUING MY DREAM OF BECOMING A REGISTERED NURSE. I SIMULTANEOUSLY HELP THREE SEPARATE MINIMUM WAGE JOBS WHILE TRYING MY BEST TO NAVIGATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM LOCAL PUBLIC COLLEGES WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED IN FOR YEARS I SAT ON WAITING LISTS ARE OFFERED IRRELEVANT COURSES. IN ORDER TO STAY REGISTERED AS A STUDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT CONCLUDES THAT THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NAME AN AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. MAP BACK REPRESENTING CAPS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN ADDITION A WHEN THIS IS IMPORTANT I LIKE TO CALL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WOULD WITNESSES LIKE IN OPPOSITION WISHING TO SPEAK. A KILEY COME UP TO THE TABLE HERE AND WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FOR PROVIDE UP TO THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN TOTAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DIANE HAS TO LACI ON THE DEAN OF HEALTH SCIENCES AND HUMAN SERVICES AT SADDLEBACK COLLEGE IN MISSION VIEJO CALIFORNIA. NURSING PROGRAMS EDUCATE OVER FIFTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS EDUCATE OVER 50% OF ALL PRE LICENSURE REGISTERED NURSES IN CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGISTERED NURSING PROGRAMS OFFER SOCIAL MOBILITY TO UNDERSERVED SOCIO ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS VETERANS AND SECOND CHRIS STUDENTS WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF CRUSHING EDUCATION RELATED DEBT. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF NURSING EDUCATION AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE A LOW COST PATHWAY. TO THE PROFESSION OF REGISTERED NURSING THUS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE A. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR PROPOSESTO UTILIZE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ACCREDITATION AS A PROXY FOR BEER AND REGULATION. REGULATION AN ACCREDITATION ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS BEER AND REGULATIONS ARE ENFORCEABLE SET MINIMUM STANDARDS AND CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE MINIMAL FACULTY AND CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS A COLLEGIAL PROCESS TO ENSURE ECKEL DISTRIBUTION OF LIMITED BUT ESSENTIAL CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. TO REPLACE YOUR IN REGULATION WITH ACCREDITATION REMOVES PATIENT PROTECTIONS AND PUTS PATIENTS AT RISK. THIS LEGISLATION IS SPONSORED BY INSTITUTIONS THAT SEEK TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT WITHOUT BEER AND REGULATION. AS A RESULT OF THE RAPID GROWTH OF TWELVE NEW PRE LICENSURE PROGRAMS IN ORANGE COUNTY. MANY WELL ESTABLISHED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS MANY WELL ESTABLISHED HIGH PERFORMING NATIONALLY CREDITED COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DECREASE ENROLLMENT. TWO YEARS AGO ALL FORMS COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE NOTIFIED ABLE TO HAVE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS OF THE PRIMARY PEDIATRIC FACILITY IN ORANGE COUNTY. I WAS NOTED THAT IT WAS NOTED AT THIS TIME THAT A RELATIVELY NEW RAPIDLY GROWING PRIVATE NURSING PROGRAM MADE A DONATION TO THE PEDIATRIC FACILITY OF MORE THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND HAD COINCIDENTLY THREE TIMES MORE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS IN THE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMBINED. FORTUNATELY THANKS TO BE OUR AND INTERVENTION COMPROMISES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE PEDIATRIC FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ALTHOUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DECREASE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BY 40%. CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WERE PRESERVED WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEER AND ADVOCACY WHICH WAS ESSENTIAL IN REACHING A COMPROMISE WITHOUT THEIR INTERVENTION A LOW COST PATHWAY TO THE REGISTERED NURSING PREVENTION. PROFESSION WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PRESERVED IN ORANGE COUNTY. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR POSES A THREAT TO THE LONG TERM. SUSTAINABILITY OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES. COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE THIRTY SECONDS LEFT. I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO CURTIS. AFTERNOON CURSE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G WITH THE&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION CNA AS OPPOSED AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR IN THE AMENDMENTS I'LL JUST SUM IT UP BY SAYING SEE NAY SUPPOSED TO IN ADDITION TO WHAT TIME TO SET. SEEN AS OPPOSED TO THE AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD INCREASE SIMULATION -- UP 250% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLINICAL HOURS RATHER THAN EXISTING LAWS CAP ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS OF ALLOWABLE SIMULATION IN A PARTICULAR COURSE. THIS ABOUT THE MEANS THAT 100% OF AN INDIVIDUAL COURSE COULD BE SIMULATION RATHER THAN DIRECT PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCE AS LONG AS NO MORE THAN 50% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CLINICAL HOURS WITH SIMULATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME INTO MY FROM NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. THANK YOU CHIRLA MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION.

AND HE'S READY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE NO OFFICIAL POSITION AT THIS TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE BILL AND AMENDMENTS AS PRESENTED WE THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR HER WORKING WE WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH HER IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU I HAVE OF COMMON AND ONE QUESTIONEIGHT I BELIEVE PROBABLY FOR THE OPPOSITION -- IT OCCURS TO ME THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS NURSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA -- IT ALSO OCCURS TO ME OFFICERS JUST ON A PERSONAL ANECDOTE MY MOM WENT THROUGH A AND ARE IN PROGRAM OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH BACK TO WORK IN HER FIFTIES -- SHE HAD WAITED TIRE YEAR BECAUSE OF AN ARTIFICIAL LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF SPOTS TO SIT FOR A YEAR WAITING FOR THE SPOTS TO OPEN UP THE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO. I KNOW FROM THAT AND THEN AS PRICE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO MAYBE TEN BUT I AND I KNOW FROM THAT THAT THE THESE PROGRAMS ARE DEFINITELY IMPACTED. IN WE HAVE A NURSING SHORTAGE. I HEAR THE CONCERNS ABOUT. OF THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. BUT AS I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL IT'S LIMITED TO TO PROGRAMS THAT CAN STILL SHOW AN 80% PASS RATE ON THE ON THE BOARDS. SO COULD YOU ADDRESS WHY THAT. THAT -- THAT DOES DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN AND THESE PEOPLE STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE NATIONAL TESTS AND THEY STILL UP THIS. TO PASS 80% IN ORDER FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. TO TO REMAIN VALID UNDER THIS BILL ADDRESS THE PASS RATE OF THE PASSWORD IS ONLY PART OF THE CALL THE COMPETENCY EVALUATION. WHICH IS A THAT I GOT TWO PART OF COURSE WE'RE CONCERNED ESPECIALLY WITH THE SIMULATION AND HANDS ON PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCE IS THAT WOULD BE CUT BACK BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME IN SIMULATION RELATIVE TO ACTUAL PATIENT CARE EXPERIENCES. AS WELL AS A LIMITATION ON THE B. R. AND REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE -- TO REGULATE. THE ARM. THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR CURRICULUM MINIMUM FACULTY QUALIFICATIONS AND TO HELP WITH SEEK CLINICAL DISPLACEMENT ISSUES THAT EXIST. ASSEMBLY MEMBER A LIKE TO ADDRESS THE NURSING SHORTAGE THIS BILL IS BASED ON A SO CALLED NOR SOME NURSING SHORTAGE -- BUT THE REPORT THE PROPONENTS RELY ON IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH ANY OTHER STUDY THAT HAS LOOKED AT CALIFORNIA'S NURSING WORKFORCE NEEDS. USE UCF CALL YOU SEE S. F. HAS CALLED THIS STUDY IN OUT LIAR INSTEAD AT UCSF HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY NURSES GRADUATING FROM NURSING PROGRAMS AND SURPLUSES IN LA REGION WHICH INCLUDES ORANGE AND VENTURA COUNTIES. AND THE SACRAMENTO AND INLAND EMPIRE -- REGIONS SO ONE OF THE PRIMARY JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN EXIST WHICH IS THE SO CALLED NURSING SHORTAGE. THE CHAIRS INTELLIGENCE CAN ASK IF THE THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS EITHER. THE COMMENTS IN RESPONSE. WELL I WILL JUST ADDRESS I SAID ON AGING ON LONG TERM CARE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OR RIDGES IN LA COUNTY IN THE MORE. AFFLUENT OR DANCE COUNTIES BUT YESTERDAY'S AGING LONG TERM CARE -- MEETING ADDRESSED THE ISSUE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORK FORCE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I APPRECIATE THAT. BECAUSE I'M FROM LA COUNTY AT THAT WE HAVE AN OR BRIDGE IN LA COUNTY HOWEVER I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE ENTIRE STATE AND THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE -- IN THE RURAL AREAS AND I DO REPRESENT DALY COUNTY HOWEVER I AM ALSO A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH WHICH AREAS. HAVE MORE AND THE ONES THAT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WILL TOO BAD FOR THEM FOR ME I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ESPECIALLY WITH THE SILVER TSUNAMI THAT'S COMING -- THEY'RE ALL THERE ARE OLD PEOPLE IN THE VALLEY TO AND THEY NEED CARE OUR LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES HAVE A SHORTAGE AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT STATISTICS -- AND THERE'S AN ODD SHORTAGE IN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS WELL AND JUST FURTHER WE DON'T CAP THE AMOUNT OF TEACHERS THAT GO TO SCHOOL ATTORNEYS WE DON'T CAP THE AMOUNT OF ANY OTHER PROFESSIONS. AND I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD CAP A THIS CRITICAL -- COMPONENT OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SO THAT'S MY OPINION BUT IN TERMS OF THE THAT TECHNICAL ISSUES GEORGE DO YOU WANT. TO TALK ABOUT THAT. YEAH ONE ONE I'D DON'T THINK WE DISAGREE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT SIMULATION IS ONE PORTION AND AND THE THE EXAM IS ONE PORTION AND AND YOU GOT A LOOK AT THE BODY AS A WHOLE I ALSO DON'T THINK THAT YOU GET IN THE WE ALSO AGREE THAT. IF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SEATS ARE AVAILABLE THAT IS THE LOWEST COST OPTION AND WE'RE NOT THAT THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SEATS ARE AVAILABLE THAT'S A GREAT OPTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT TO GET IN INTO YOUR EIGHTY AND IF YOU WANT TO GO BEYOND. THAT OR WHAT HAVE YOU THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS IN IN IT IS AN ISSUE AND THE AND THE THE THE CLINICAL SLOTS ARE AN ISSUE. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO OPEN UP THE FLOODGATES HERE. WE ARE TRYING TO WEAVE I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS PUT IN SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS. WITH THAT COMMITTEE OFFERED AMENDMENTS ABOUT MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOSPITALS AS IT WAS ALLEGED. OR MENTIONED I SHOULD SAY A MOMENT AGO. TO PUT A PROHIBITION IN PLACE. THE COMMITTEE PUT IN A COHORT DEFAULT RATE WHICHIS ACTUALLY LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE. FOR ACCOUNT NANCY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PERFORM IT TWICE THE LEVEL OF AN INSTITUTION QUALIFYING FOR CAL GRANTS SO I THINK THE COMMITTEE IS DONE A LOT. TO IT TOO TO TAKE THE BILL AND ACTUALLY TAKE IT AND MAKE IT A BETTER BILL TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THEN DENTAL WAS AS WE INTRODUCED IT. AND I THINK THAT. THE THE SPONSORS WANT TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I HAD A I HAD A REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM SEIU LAST THURSDAY WAS VERY ENCOURAGING I THINK WE AGREED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK MOVING FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE HERE WANTS WE DO NOT HAVE THIS. MANIFEST DESTINY YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA GRAB ALL OF THE SLOTS AND AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE IMPORTANT. IN MY FATHER'S A GREAT ANYWAY DOES MATTER [inaudible] IT'S IMPORTANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AS A MEMBER FONG. AT JUST THE FOLLOWING ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM IS -- THAT QUESTIONS I'VE MAYBE IT'S DIRECTED TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS I REPRESENTS A CENTRAL VALLEY OCCURRING COUNTY WE CLEARLY HAVE WAITING LISTS IN OUR COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND WE ALSO WE DEFINITELY DO HAVE A NURSING SHORTAGE -- IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO -- IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THAT HOW BORING THIS BILL WHICH I I DON'T WANT SUPPORT TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE NEGOTIATED. AT TELL THEM AND BE IMPROVED UPON HOW HOW WOULD DO WE GET MORE NURSES IN THE SUCH ABOUT. THE BIG CAP THAT YOU REFERRED TO IS IT WAS REALLY NOT THE NUMBER OF NURSES THAT CAN BE EDUCATED BUT SEE A NUMBER OF CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THAT EXIST IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THE EDUCATION THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE HOURS AND OF A CLINICAL INSTRUCTION THAT ARE REQUIRED AND EDUCATIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF THE NURSING PROGRAM. SO WHEN GROWTH IS CENTERED IN THE CENTRAL AREA SPECIFIC AREA HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE AGENCIES ARE OVER RUN WITH REQUEST TO SUPPORT NURSING STUDENTS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. SO THE CAP EXIST IN THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS WHEN A NEW PROGRAM COMES IN AND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS ARE FULL OR CAPPED AND HAVE NO MORE ROOM SOMEONE ASKED TO LEAVE. THEY HAVE TO MAKE ROOM AND HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE DISPLACED BY THE GROWING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE GROWN WITHOUT REGULATION AND VERY RAPIDLY. IF I MAY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE THE SCHOOLS THE SPONSORS -- ARE ADDING A MORE SCHOOLS THESE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR AM I MISTAKEN. YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTION WAS HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS. I DO KNOW THE WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY IS ACTIVELY LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIPS IN THE VALLEY I KNOW THAT THEY ARE. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL AND I BELIEVE IT IS STOCKTON ABOUT PARTNERING WITH THEM ON BEING ABLE TO DO CLINICAL ROTATIONS. SAID THEY ARE VERY MUCH -- THINK THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING TO WORK IN. THE PARTNERSHIP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL IN AREAS THAT. THERE ARE -- MORE ACUTE SHORTAGES YOU THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT YES OR SOMEWHERE FONG JR AND I'M AND I'M I I I'M NOT MY QUESTIONS AS VISITING SPECIFIC SCHOOLS -- MY MY QUESTION IS JUST IN IN TERMS OF THERE IS A NEED -- I THINK OUR HOSPITALS OF CERTAINLY ARE LOOKING -- TO TO HIRE MORE NURSES WITH THEIR NOW FORCED TO BRING -- NURSES FROM OVERSEAS -- NOW ON A TRAVEL NURSES AS WELL AND SO THEY MADE. FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A A CLEAR I MEAN -- PEOPLE'S LIVES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE ARE ARE BEING IMPACTED RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF A NURSES COMING THAT SUCH ABOUT. THE BARRING ANY OTHER AREA -- LATE SO IN CALIFORNIA -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA -- SO AND IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ADDRESS A SPECIFIC NEED IN MY COMMUNITY -- I I WAS JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS OF HOW WE ADDRESS THAT BARRING. PUTTING WINTERS IS IN THE PIPELINE. IT WAS IT WAS IT BUT JUST AS THE S. M. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SEMI FONG WOULD JUST -- GOING TO THE ANY OTHER MEMBER ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA -- YES -- TO THE AUTHOR I'M SORRY DID NOT HAVE A CONVERSATION BEFORE AS I'M SUBBING TODAY BUT THIS CONVERSATION AS FAR AS THE COMMENTS WERE MADE. AS FAR AS THE PLACEMENTS AND SOMETIMES. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS NOTED THAT THERE WAS A CONTRIBUTION. AND THEN THERE WAS A SCENARIO THAT DEVELOPED -- BETWEEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DIDN'T NOW THE PLACEMENT -- THAT THEY ARE USUALLY EXPECTED SO THAT THEIR STUDENTS COULD GET THE ACTUAL PRACTICE -- AND THAT ACTUALLY HAS OCCURRED -- AS I'VE HAD. IN MY LOCAL DISTRICT A CYPRESS COLLEGE WHICH IS WELL KNOWN FOR THEIR NURSING PROGRAM THE DIRECTOR -- SPEAK TO ME ABOUT HOW. THEY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR PROGRAM WHEN THEY CAN'T GET THE PLACEMENT AFTER THE STUDENTS ARE. DOING THEIR BASIC WORK AND NOW THEY NEED TO BE PLACED ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES IS WE HAVE A PRIVATE COLLEGE THAT IS WITHIN THE SAME. RADIUS AND IT IN AND IT APPEARED THAT THOSE STUDENTS WERE BEING TAKEN AHEAD OF THE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO -- WITHOUT GIVING TOO MUCH MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT IT IS A BIG CONCERN AS I KNOW IN HERE OFTEN THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE WAITING THEY MAY EVEN ATTEND ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN -- TAKE COURSE WORK THERE I HAVE FULLER CHEN COLLEGE OF AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE OTHER ONE BUT THEY'RE STILL WAITING SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO BE A NON VOTE JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO SIT DOWN AND FIND OUT. MORE ABOUT THIS AS THEIR IT SEEMS TO BE MIXED INFORMATION OF DO WE HAVE NURSES MOVING THROUGH THE PIPE LINE OR ARE THERE. I CONTINUE TO HEAR ABOUT IT AS GETTING NURSES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND SO FORTH SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME [inaudible] FOR AND THE THE AUTHOR SEEN NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO JEWISH TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT ACCESS I'M A COMMUNITY COLLEGE A PRODUCT OF EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE MYSELF AND SO I BELIEVE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION BUT I ALSO BELIEVE IN. ACCESS FOR FOLKS THAT DON'T HAVE -- THE LUXURY OF WAITING -- IN MY PARTICULAR AREA ESPECIALLY IN EAST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE WAITING ANOTHER YEAR JUST MEANS WAITING ANOTHER YEAR TO START A CAREER THAT THAT NOT ONLY WILL HELP THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT ACT HEALTH ACCESS BUT ALSO. AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATE I WAS ABLE TO GET TO WORK IMMEDIATELY AND SO EXPANDING ACCESS TO THESEPROGRAMS WILL HELP AND AGAIN SITTING IN LAW -- AGING AND LONG TERM CARE GAVE ME THE THE THE SNAPSHOT ABOUT NON LA COUNTY FOLKS THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AGAIN I REPRESENT -- THE FOURTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN LA COUNTY BUT I'M ALSO CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVE IN MY JOB I SEE AS I SEE IT IS -- TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE COMMUNITY SO THAT WE ALL CONTRACT TOGETHER -- AND SO WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS SOMEONE RUBIO THIS DOES ENJOYED TO PASS RECOMMENDATION I KNOW THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUED. WITH RESPECT TO FOCUS ON THE QUALITY CONTROLS IN THE CRITICAL DISPLACEMENT ASH AT THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND COMMITTEE SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY FOUR MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS LOW THOUGH I BROKE BLOOM. BUT MY CHEN CHEN AYE CHIU. CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM I. DOLLY EGGMAN. WHEN I FONG FONG AYE GIPSON?

THE BILL HAS THIRTEEN BOTH BELIEVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU REST MEMBERS WE ARE ON A FINAL BILL. AND THIS IS. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE SO THE MEANTIME IT AGAIN IF -- MEMBERS ANYONE ELSE'S LISTENING TO KILEY CALL ARE BEING P. MEMBERS TO COMMITTEES A SO WE CAN FINISH AND CONCLUDE AND ADJOURNED SO HAVING SAID THAT AGAIN MEMBERS THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY SEVEN AB [inaudible] FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE VERSUS. FIRST LET ME EXCEPT THE ARE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE YOUR WORK ON THE ISSUE WHEN CALIFORNIA VOTED TO LEGALIZE CANNABIS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN UNDER PROP. SIXTY FOUR THEY ALLOWED CITIES THE ABILITY TO LICENSE BUSINESSES FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS SUCH AS LOUNGES OR CAFES. AND WHILE THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN THESE BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE THERE IS NO CONSUMPTION LICENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL PRESENTLY. LOUNGES ARE CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT ALLOW FOR THE ON SITE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS CURRENTLY BUSINESSES THAT'S THAT -- RECEIVE A LOCAL CONSUMPTION LICENSE MUST OBTAIN A STATE ADULT USE CANNABIS RETAIL LICENSE AND CONFORM TO THOSE REGULATIONS HOWEVER THESE REGULATIONS ARE GEARED TOWARDS RETAIL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. AND SPECIFICALLY THEY DO NOT ALLOW NON CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD WHICH MEANS THAT A CANNABIS LOUNGE CANNOT SELL. NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. THE ISSUE WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH HERE CREATING A SEPARATE LICENSE AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES WITH ACCOMPANYING RULES AND REGULATIONS ALIGNED WITH THOSE BUSINESSES. IS NOT NECESSARY SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE EFFECTIVELY. CANNABIS CONSUMPTION LOUNGES MAY SOON BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE NIGHT LIFE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM ECONOMIES IN THE CITIES THAT AUTHORIZED THEM. THUS CREATING APPROPRIATE REGULATIONS FOR THESE BUSINESSES IS NECESSARY AND SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL WILL CONFORM STATE POLICY WITH LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT ARE RELATED TO THESE EMERGING HOSPITALITY VENUES. HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR THAT A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE LEAVES IT UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOW THESE LOUNGES IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THEIR CITY AS THEY CURRENTLY CAN DO. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL'S JOHN LEONARD WITH THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP TO THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN LEONARD AND I'M WITH THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION SIXTY FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD ELECTED TO GRANT LICENSES FOR CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. AT THAT TIME IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT CONSUMPTION LOUNGES WOULD OBTAIN RETAIL CANNABIS LICENSES FROM THE STATE BUT WOULD ONLY SELL PRODUCTS FOR ON SITE CONSUMPTION. WHEN THE FREDDIE AND WHEN THE CITY FIRST STARTED WRITING IT'S CANNABIS ORDINANCE DRAFT STATE REGULATIONS LLOWED FOR THE SALE OF NON CANNABIS PRODUCTS? WHICH COULD INCLUDE FOOD AND BEVERAGES. WITH THIS IN MIND THE CITY ENVISIONED THAT CANNABIS LOUNGES WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES ALONG WITH CANNABIS PRODUCTS. HOWEVER WHEN FINAL CANNABIS REGULATIONS WERE RELEASED IN JANUARY. THIS PROVISION HAD BEEN CHANGED AND ON CANNABIS PRODUCTS WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED. THE PROHIBITION ON THE SALE OF NON CANNABIS PRODUCTS MAKES SENSE FOR RETAIL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR CONSUMPTION LOUNGE TO BE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING FOOD. NINE CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO WEST HOLLYWOOD'S CONSUMPTION LOUNGES BECAUSE THESE LOUNGES WILL BE HIGH QUALITY HOSPITALITY BUSINESSES. AS MORE CITIES CONSIDER ISSUING CONSUMPTION LOUNGE LICENSES IT ALSO MAKES SENSE TO HAVE SPECIFIC STATE REGULATIONS REGARDING THEM INSTEAD OF SIMPLY USING. STATE RETAIL REGULATIONS SINCE THE BUSINESS MODELS FOR THESE TWO BUSINESSES ARE DIFFERENT. WITH THIS IN MIND AB FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD CREATE A NEW LICENSE TYPE AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR CONSUMPTION LOUNGES. ANALYZE THE BUREAU CANNABIS TOOK CONTROL TO CREATE REGULATIONS FOR THIS LICENSE TYPE. DURING THE TIME THOSE REGULATIONS ARE BEING DRAFTED AB FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALSO ALLOWS THE BUREAU TO ISSUE A RETAIL LICENSE. THE CONSUMPTION LOUNGE DESIGNATION TO CANNABIS LOUNGES THAT ARE READY TO OPEN. THESE BUSINESSES WOULD BE A WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADHERE TO ALL STATE RETAIL REGULATIONS WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS. INCLUDING BEING ALLOWED TO PREPARE AND SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES FOR ON SITE CONSUMPTION. THIS WOULD ALLOW THESE BUSINESSES TO OPERATE AS ENVISIONED WHILE THE FINAL REGULATIONS ARE DRAFTED IN CLOSING. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR CURRENTLY ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PERMIT CANNABIS CONSUMPTION BUSINESSES IF THEY DESIRE. TO BUT RECENTLY ADOPTED STATE REGULATIONS DO NOT ALLOW THOSE BUSINESSES TO PREPARE AND SELL NON CANNABIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES FOR THEIR FOR ON SITE CONSUMPTION. WHICH IS IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS AB FOURTEEN SIXTY FIVE ALLOWS THOSE BUSINESSES TO PREPARE AND SERVE FOOD AND ALSO ALLOWS THE BEER TO BEGIN THE PROCESS. OF CREATING REGULATIONS TAILORED TO THE GROWING CANNABIS CONSUMPTION INDUSTRY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.
