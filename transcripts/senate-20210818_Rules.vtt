THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT'S IN

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.832
WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.735
WATER CAPTURE. WATER RECYCLING

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:32.438
GROUNDWATER CLEANUP- WE ALSO

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.073
HAVE TO REINVEST NOT JUST IN

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.841
THE BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IN

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.610
THE PEOPLE INFRASTRUCTURE OUR

CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY AS

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:47.753
SHOWN THAT. CLEAN AND CLEAN AIR

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.021
BE THE- OF. TWENTY FIRST

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.923
CENTURY ECONOMY AND HAVE TO BE

EXIST START COMMUNITIES TOO

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:35.301
OFTEN BASED OFF OF RACE. AND

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:36.502
THAT ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.404
WATER AND SANITATION IS THE

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.706
BASIS FOR ANY ODERN. ECONOMY

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:43.209
AND FOR ANY ANY COMMUNITY THAT

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:44.143

FROM FROM FROM OUR PROGRAMS

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.513
THAT CAN SEEM INFLEXIBLE OR

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.981
BUREAUCRATIC. AND I KNOW THAT

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:25.150
WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN VERY MUCH SO

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:26.352
TO ENSURING THAT WE BEST

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.619
UNDERSTAND WHERE WHERE

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.121
FLEXIBILITY IS INTO VERY MUCH

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:30.656
EXPRESS IT AND I KNOW THAT

00:16:30.723 --> 00:16:31.990
THERE'S BEEN A PARTICULARLY

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.926
WHEN IT COMES TO. POPULATION

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:36.962
CAPS AND HOW THEY TIE INTO

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.931
CERTAIN FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR US

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:40.099
CAN BE SOMETIMES VERY

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.301
FRUSTRATING AND CANDIDLY WE

00:16:42.368 --> 00:16:43.869
CONTINUE TO SEE LARGER

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.038
COMMUNITIES OF SIZE. STRUGGLING

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:47.072
WITH WITH A LOT OF THE SAME

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.507
CHALLENGES MANY OF OUR SMALLER

00:16:48.574 --> 00:16:49.975
SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN FACING WITH

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:52.044
FOR YEARS AND SO IT'S ALWAYS

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:53.579
GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:16:53.645 --> 00:16:54.279
FOR US TO CONTINUE TO BE

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.447
FLEXIBLE WITH OUR PROGRAMS AND

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:56.849
MAKE SURE WE DON'T JUST HAVE.

00:16:56.915 --> 00:16:58.717
OUR NUMBERS IN PLACE THAT-

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.452
DON'T APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED OF

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.721
THE NEEDS THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:05.457
N. A. N. IT LEADS TO. THE NEXT

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.259
OF MY TWO QUESTIONS AND IT'S

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.361
HAS TO DO WITH THE CULTURE AND

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:10.662
I THINK OTHER PEOPLE WILL TALK

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:11.964
ABOUT THE LARGER CULTURE AND

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.499
THEIR TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.567
DIVERSITY AND OTHERS. THAT THAT

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:19.338
ARE. REALLY WORTHY OF LOOKING

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:19.872
AT BUT- THE ONE WE HAD OUR

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.039
MEETING TALKED ABOUT I WAS

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:22.374
AWARE ONE PARTICULAR WATER

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:24.209
RIGHTS SITUATION THAT IS IN MY

00:17:24.276 --> 00:17:26.245
HOME AREA THAT TOOK FOUR YEARS

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.813
ED AND I TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.081
SAID TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU DON'T

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:30.482
UNDERSTAND THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.718
QUICKEST ONES WE'VE DONE. IT

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:35.554
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:35.921
A WHOLE ISSUE OF

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:38.457
RESPONSIVENESS. AND IT IF YOU

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.759
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:41.894
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.396
EXPEDITIOUSLY THAT YOU ADD FOR

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.299
THEM. ASK FOR THEM COULD YOU

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.268
SPEAK TO JUST SORT OF. LIKE THE

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.769
CULTURE OF THE AGENCY WITH

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.704
REGARD TO BEING RESPONSIVE AND

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.206
HOW YOU'VE WORKED ON THAT AND

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:55.007
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE WAYS

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.608
YOU'VE ADDRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT

00:17:56.675 --> 00:18:03.015

STATE BOARD MEMBERS HAVE SOME

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.657
SPECIALIZATION- AND HI MY SEAT

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.659
IS THE PUBLIC ONE AND SO I FIND

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.994
MYSELF OFTEN. CONTEMPLATING

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:17.129
WHAT IS IT THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO

00:18:17.196 --> 00:18:18.864
BE BRINGING THEM TO THE BOARD I

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:20.833
THROUGH THE PUBLIC SEAT AND

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:23.168
RESPONSIVENESS TO THE NEEDS.

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.239
DECISION MAKING ARE SUCH A

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:28.807
STRONG PILLAR TO THAT TO WORK

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.943
THE WAY I SEE I REALLY BUT I

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:32.444
NEED TO BRING AS A LENDS TO MY

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:35.147
WORK. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ANY

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:37.282
CRITICISMS AROUND. THAT SORT OF

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.017
THE SLOW PACE OF RESPONSE FOR

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:41.987
OR OTHERWISE- I NEED FOR US TO

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.622
BE MORE TRANSPARENT IN OUR IN

00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:45.624

WE'RE DOING AND WHEN. I THINK

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.243
THAT WHAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.077
REMEMBER IS THAT TAKES

TECHNICAL WORK AT THE BOARD IN

A DROUGHT. A RATHER SEVERE ONE.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:44.309
AND I READ THE NEWS ACCOUNTS OF

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.144
THE BOARD'S DECISION WITH

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.914
REGARD TO THE FIRST. DELTA

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:51.016
WATER RIGHTS. AND I HAD SOME

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:52.451
CONCERNS BASED ON THE NEWS

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.286
ACCOUNTS AND SO IN OUR MEETING

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:56.588
I ASKED YOU ABOUT IT AND- IT

00:20:56.655 --> 00:20:58.090
SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WERE A

00:20:58.156 --> 00:20:59.725
LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT MORE

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:01.893
IN EVIDENCE IN THE NEWSPAPER

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.562
ACCOUNTS THAT HELP EXPLAIN THIS

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.831
DECISION AND ONE OF THE

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.933
SURPRISES TO ME. WAS WHEN I

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.402
HEARD THAT MY CLOSE FRIEND TOM

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:12.170
BIRMINGHAM AND WESTLANDS WATER

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:14.406
DISTRICT SUPPORTED WHAT THE

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.941
BOARD DID WHICH YOU WOULD NOT

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:18.610
GET FROM THE NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS

00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.646
AND SO I WAS WONDERING. IF YOU

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.381
MIGHT TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.250
IN A WAY THAT. THAT WE COULD

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:27.152
CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.021
HOW PEOPLE WIND UP AND WHAT THE

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:30.489
IMPACT OF YOUR DECISION IS

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:34.326
GOING TO BE. THANK YOU SENATOR

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.094
I'LL TRY MY BEST TO DISTINCT

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:38.864
AND BRIEF- WATER RIGHTS. AND IF

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.365
THE DISCUSSION AROUND IT CAN

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.733
CAN TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE BUT

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.934
I THINK IT'S THERE'S A PRETTY

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:44.903
SPENT SIMPLE FUNDAMENTALS.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.205
AMONGST THAT WORK AS AS WE ALL

00:21:47.272 --> 00:21:49.641
KNOW THAT WATER RATES SYSTEM IS

00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:51.109
HOW WE ALLOCATE WATER IN THE

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:53.378
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YEAH

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.881
IT IS IT IS NOT LOST ON ME BUT

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:56.748
IS ACTUALLY ONLY THE THIRD

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:59.017
TIME. IN THIS TRIAL NOW THAT

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:00.085
THE BOARD HAS ACTUALLY

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:02.054
CURTAILED RIGHTS MEANING WE'VE

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.022
WE'VE WE'VE HOTEL BECAUSE THE

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.792
HYDROLOGY IS SO POOR. AND

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:08.260
OTHERWISE WE HAVE A PRETTY

00:22:08.326 --> 00:22:10.462
LIGHT TOUCH ON OUR WATER RATES

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:11.463
ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE OF

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.165
CALIFORNIA. IT'S ONLY A FEW

00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:15.000
YEARS AGO THAT WE BEGAN

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:16.768
REQUIRING YEARLY REPORTING FROM

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.603
ALL OF OUR WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.038
OTHER DIVERSIONS FROM THE PRIOR

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.406
YEAR SO YOU THINK OF A WATER

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:22.274
RIGHTS SYSTEM IN ITS

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.109
ADMINISTRATION. IT IT CAN BE

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:25.577
PRETTY SIMPLE HERE IT'S ABOUT

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:27.079
WHO'S TAKING WHAT OUT OF THE

00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:30.248
SYSTEM AND WHEN AND- MEETING IT

00:22:30.315 --> 00:22:31.817
TO BE A TAG TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:22:31.883 --> 00:22:33.351
HYDROLOGICALLY AVAILABLE. AND

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:34.052
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:35.754
COMPLICATED THING AS SIMPLE OF

00:22:35.821 --> 00:22:37.489
A CONCEPT IS A CAN SOUND. AND

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:39.791
SO- THERE'S JUST A INCREDIBLE

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:41.293
NEED FOR US TO CONTINUE TO

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:42.227
ENSURE THAT THE WATER RIGHT

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.296
SYSTEM IS HERE AND CAN BE

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:45.630
RESPONSIVE. IN THE FACE OF

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.332
DROUGHT IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:49.101
CHANGE AND SO THE BOARD'S

00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:51.636
ACTION WAS TO. DO WHAT WE CAN

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.472
ALL SEE THAT QUITE CLEARLY

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.773
WHICH IS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.575
WATER TO FILL ALL THE RIGHTS IN

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:58.176
THE WATERSHED. AND SO WE NEED

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:59.644
TO BEGIN TO CURTAIL THOSE IN A

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.880
WAY THAT HELP US KEEP GAP TO

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.415
PROTECT THEM AND KEEPING

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:05.684
CRITICAL ARTICLES HERE IN MIND

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:07.786
WHICH ARE LIKE. WHICH INCLUDES

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.588
KEEPING WATER UP IN OUR

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:10.889
RESERVOIRS WHAT WE WERE SEEING

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.324
WAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.826
DEPLETIONS MEANING WATER THAT

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.928
WAS BEING. RELEASED FROM THE

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:18.330
RESERVOIRS WASN'T MAKING IT TO

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.065
THE DELTA DEPLETIONS BEFORE

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:22.567
WATER MADE OUT TO THE DELTA SO.

00:23:22.634 --> 00:23:23.802
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE BOARD

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:25.904
WAS NEEDING TO ACT- BECAUSE WE

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:27.773
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PRESERVE AS

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:28.940
MUCH WATER NOW AS WE CAN IN OUR

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:34.246
RESERVOIRS IN ANTICIPATION. OF

00:23:34.312 --> 00:23:35.313
A CONTINUED DR YEAR. AND SO-

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:35.814
YEAH THE COVER. I MAYBE

00:23:35.881 --> 00:23:37.549
SOMETIMES MAKE ITS KIND OF A

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.117
GOOD OR BLACK BAD BLACK OR

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:41.353
WHITE SORT OF- ACTION AND THAT

00:23:41.419 --> 00:23:42.554
THE BOARD DID SOMETHING THAT

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:44.489
WAS VERY RIVAS OR INTEREST TO.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:47.425
A LOT OF- THE COMMUNITIES OUT

00:23:47.492 --> 00:23:49.694
THERE FARMERS PARTICULARLY. AND

00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.496
I THINK WHAT IS BIG THE-

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:54.599
REALITY IS THAT WE NEED TO BE.

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:55.967
AT ENSURING THAT THE WATER

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.435
RATES SYSTEM IS WORKING THAT WE

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:58.570
NEED TO BE CURTAILING IN TIMES

00:23:58.637 --> 00:23:59.938
OF DROUGHT. THAT'S HOW WE

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:01.273
PROTECT ALL OF OURSELVES

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:03.408
COLLECTIVELY OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.142
AND THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:06.511
ITSELF. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SAW

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.013
A NUMBER OF- AGRICULTURAL

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.214
INTERESTS ACTUALLY INCLUDING

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.950

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:18.190
IS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE.

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:21.193
REQUIRES US TO ACTUALLY ENSURE

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:22.227
THAT. INDIVIDUALS ARE TAKING

00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:23.762
WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM WHEN

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:24.796
THEY DON'T HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.832
TO IT OR WHEN WE'RE NOT ABLE

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:30.135

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.777
THE SITUATION. THE FACT THAT

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.979

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:03.134
COMPLEX POLICY ISSUES. WE HAVE

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:05.337
LEGISLATORS LEGISLATORS HAVE TO

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:07.372
DEAL WITH SO IT'S BEEN

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.006
CHALLENGING TO ME BECAUSE I DO

THAT IS- CERTAINLY WERE

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:13.712
CHALLENGED BUT NOT TO THE

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.413
DEGREE THAT HAS GONE ON WITH

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.883
THE DELTA AND ALL OF ON THE ON

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:28.260
ADDRESSING. THE PREVENTION THE

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.929
LONGER TERM- WATER RESOURCES

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:32.898
NEEDS ORANGE COUNTY A LEADER IN

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:34.933

THE GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS. EX

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:40.939
EXTREMELY- SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

BACK IN THE EARLY TWO

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:53.952
THOUSANDS. AND BECAME REALITY

CAN DO THESE THINGS AND- THEN

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:02.994
THEY THEY DO A FINALLY APPEAR

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.930
BAD INCETIVE IS NEEDED.

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:06.865
RESOURCES FINANCIAL ARE NEEDED

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.233

OTHER BAD TOM THERE'S ALWAYS

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:35.060
GOING TO BE THE ISSUE WITH

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.895
WHERE DO WE GET WATER WHEN WE

WATER RECYCLING WHEN IT COMES

00:27:51.102 --> 00:27:52.804
TO DRINKING WATER MEANING. THAT

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:54.305
IT EITHER GOES TO A GROUNDWATER

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.808
BASIN LIKE AN ORANGE COUNTY- OR

00:27:56.875 --> 00:27:58.610
MIGHT GO TO A DRINKING WATER

00:27:58.676 --> 00:28:00.245
RESERVOIR BEFORE MAKING IT TO

00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:01.479
THAN A DRINKING WATER TREATMENT

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.882
PLANT- AND WE HAVE PROJECTS

WILL BE OUR DIRECT POTABLE

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.758
REUSE PROJECTS MEANING. THAT

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.060
THE WATER THAT'S RECYCLED WILL

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:17.095
GO DIRECTLY INTO DISTRIBUTION

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:18.830
AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS.

00:28:18.897 --> 00:28:20.865
THIS IS A HUGELY HI IT IS NOT

00:28:20.932 --> 00:28:23.034
DONE LIGHTLY WORK FOR

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:26.337
CENTURIES- AT MELANIA- WE HAVE

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:27.639
KNOWN THAT WE HAVE TO SEPARATE

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.407
OUR SANITATION SYSTEMS AND OUR

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.242
DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. AND TO

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:32.977
COMBINE THE CHU IS TIPPED TO

00:28:33.044 --> 00:28:34.779
OPEN UP. THE POSSIBILITY FOR

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:36.748
PATHOGENS AND OTHER CHALLENGES

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.851
AND SO. WHAT THIS OUR STATE HAS

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:41.920
BEEN A LEADER AND IS STRIVING

00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:44.089
WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS. AND

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:45.490
NOW THESE DIRECT POTABLE REUSE

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:46.591
PROJECTS ARE THAT NEXT

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.326
GENERATION SO AS WE DEVELOP

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:49.561
THOSE REGULATIONS WE ALREADY

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:51.963
SEE PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.032
AND WITH WITH THE METROPOLITAN

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:55.867
WATER DISTRICT AND L. A. COUNTY

00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.869
SAN COMING TO PROVE THAT BEEN

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.504
DISCUSSING COMING TO FRUITION.

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.872
AND OTHER PLACES IN THE STATE

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:01.639
THAT WILL TAKE THESE

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:03.341
REGULATIONS AND DEVELOP THAT

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.976
NEXT GENERATION OF PROJECTS. SO

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:06.945
WE HAVE TO BE READY TO INVEST

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:07.946
IN THEM AND WHAT WE NEED TO

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:10.048
HAVE BEEN. CONTINUING TO ADD WE

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:11.916
HAVE A RECYCLE WATER POLICY AT

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.518
THE STATE WATER BOARD- WE'RE

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:15.220
LOOKING TO BE UPDATING THAT WE

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:16.488
RECENTLY MADE SOME CHANGES

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:18.022
GIVEN TO DATA GATHERING. SO

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.591
THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.059
MUCH WATER RECYCLING IS GOING

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:23.027
ON IN THE STATE AND CONTINUE TO

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:27.365
YOU PRIVATE. AND METRIC WHY

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:28.700
IT'S NOT ON MY WE DO WITH

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:29.667
OXNARD CHANGE GOALS YOU KNOW

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:31.169
THE MEASURE IT LET'S LET'S THE

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:32.871
POLICY. AND THE PHOENIX OF IT

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:35.306
AND WITH WATER RECYCLING.

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:36.641
RECORD YOUR COMPLETELY SPOT ON

00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:37.876
CENTER THOSE ARE THESE ARE THE

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.310
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROJECTS

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:40.645
THAT WE NEED TO BE DEVELOPING

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:41.846
AND INVESTING AS WE MAKE THIS

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:43.314
GENERATIONAL REINVESTMENT IN

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:45.116
INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE GOING TO

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:46.551
HELP MAXIMIZE OUR SUPPLIES GET

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:49.053
US THROUGH BROWSE AND CONTINUE

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.622
TO TAKE HIM BACK SEMIS JUST THE

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:52.991
USE OF THE RESOURCES. WE HAVE

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:54.692
AT HAND NOW AND I THINK THERE

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:55.860
IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:56.761
DO THAT AND YOUR POINT THE

00:29:56.828 --> 00:29:58.930
CENTRAL VLLEY. HAS ACTUALLY A

00:29:58.997 --> 00:30:00.465
COUPLE OF PROJECTS OUT THERE

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:01.766
BUT NEEDS AND THERE ARE

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.668
OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT MORE AND

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:04.702
SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.304
UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO INVEST

00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:07.405
IN THOSE IMPROPER THAT THE

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.374
BOARD. AND BANKS WILL TO THE

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.109
LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP

AND THE GOVERNOR FOR. PROVIDING

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:13.878
THE BOARD ONE POINT THREE

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.480
BILLION DOLLARS NOW IN

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:16.814
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WASTE WATER

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:18.416
DRINKING WATER SYSTEM. AND

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:21.986
LOOKING TO SEE HOW WE CAN ALSO

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:22.854
BROKE OUT FOR WATER RECYCLING.

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:24.789
AND WHAT ABOUT THE CELL SINCE

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:26.191
THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:27.559
COUNTRIES AND CERTAINLY ALL THE

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:31.296
SAN DIEGO- EXPERIENCE FIVE HAS

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:33.698
BEYOND ALL QUITE SUCCESSFUL.

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:36.401
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.770
THINK THAT LIKE. IT IS A TOOL

00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:40.705
AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I AM

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:42.006
FOR COMMUNITIES TO ASSESS SOME

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.374
MONTHS THEIR PORTFOLIO OF WATER

00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:45.143
PROJECTS OUT THERE IMPORTANTLY

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.978
THE BOARD ACTUALLY HAS A D.

00:30:47.045 --> 00:30:49.080
CELL POLICY- IT IS THE

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:51.783
REGULATORY STRUCTURE BY WHICH-

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.685
PROJECTS MAKE THEIR WAY AFTER

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:54.852
REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL

00:30:54.919 --> 00:30:56.521
BOARD AND I THINK THAT. WHAT IS

00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.623
PROBABLY AN AND HELPFUL IN THE

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.824
OFFING IS MAYBE A DISCUSSION

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:01.125
ABOUT UPDATING THAT POLICY TO

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:03.595
SAY HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT IT'S

00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:05.863
THEIR TO CONTINUE TO. PROTECT

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.098
CERTAINLY OUR WATER RESOURCES

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:08.466
THAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:09.767
THAT IN THE LONG TERM FOR ALL

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.569
OF OUR PROJECTS AND ALL OF OUR

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.571

THAT DON'T DO THAT HARM AND I

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:18.710
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING

00:31:18.776 --> 00:31:21.012
TED TO CONTINUE TO BETTER

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.114

ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS AND HOW

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.110
I FELT LIKE THAT WAS AN ISSUE

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:33.378
THAT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.713

ON DIGGING WELLS THAT ARE

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.322

FIRST QUESTION I WOULD ASK YOU

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:26.798
IS ABOUT THE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA

00:34:26.864 --> 00:34:28.266
GROWS WE DID TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:29.600
WE EXCHANGED SOME TEXT MESSAGES

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.835
AND EMAILS AND YOU SAID YOU'RE

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:32.703

TO ME- ABOUT IT OR MY STAFF A

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:36.407
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.509
THOUGHT MAYBE IN YOUR PURVIEW

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.845
IS THE ILLEGAL CHEMICAL- THAT

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.947
CARBON FUERAN WILL QUARTER

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.316
TEASPOON WILL KILL AN ADULT

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:46.684
PERSON AND IT'S ONE OF THE

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.419
HIGHLY CONTAMINATED CHEMICALS

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:49.587
THAT ARE FOUND IN THESE ILLEGAL

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:51.389
MARIJUANA GROWS. AND I KNOW

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.424
WITH PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN-

00:34:53.491 --> 00:34:56.260
THOUSANDS OF THESE GROWS HAVE

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:57.929
ENDED UP ON OUR DESERT FLOOR HE

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:01.566
CAME IN- THERE SQUATTERS MOSTLY

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.367
AS A IT'S NOT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:04.602
WE'D LIKE TO GO AFTER THE LAND

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:05.870
LEASE THERE'S LANDOWNERS IF

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.038
THEY'RE LEASING PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:35:07.104 --> 00:35:08.372
DOING YOU KNOW LISTEN TO PEOPLE

00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:10.608
AND FIND A WAY TO STOP THAT THE

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.310
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE JUST

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:13.110
SQUATTERS ON OUR DESERT ALLEY

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.912
FLOOR HE CAME IN AND THEY JUST

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.014
PLOW DOWN EVERY JOSHUA TREE IN

00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:18.983
SIGHT AND WHEN SMALL

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.551
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:21.652
TO PAY YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:22.820
DOLLARS FOR A JOSHUA TREE

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.789
REMOVAL IN ORDER TO HOOK UP TO

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:26.390
THIS SYSTEM WATER DO YOU KNOW

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.326
THAT SEWER SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:31.529
REQUIRED TO BY LAW AND IS THE

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:36.701
CHEMICAL BASE GETTING BACK. TO

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.336
YOUR PER VIEW OR A DIFFERENT

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:41.138
WATER AND AGENCY. IT WOULD IT

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:44.775
WOULD DEPEND ON- THE ACTUAL

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:47.712
INCIDENT- AND HERE WE ARE

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.313

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:51.983
AUTHORITIES ARE BUT I KNOW WHEN

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:54.619
IT COMES TO WATER QUALITY

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.254
VIOLATIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.556
ARE WORKING WITH COUNTIES ON

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.525
ILLEGAL GROWS AND GO RIDING

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.326
ALONG ON ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IS

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:04.262
BECAUSE THERE ARE WATER QUALITY

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.297
VIOLATIONS AND WAR. WHEN IT

00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:07.698
COMES TO ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS OF

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:09.500
SURFACE WATER PERHAPS- THOSE

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.469
ARE OR WHERE OUR FORTIES OUR

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.371
FIRMEST THE CHALLENGE BECOMES

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.139
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ILLEGAL

00:36:15.206 --> 00:36:18.643
WELLS AND OR- GROUNDWATER BUT

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.111
WE'LL MAKE SURE TO FURTHER

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:21.946
TEASE OUT BUT I KNOW FOR SURE

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:23.247
THAT WE DO HAVE A ROLE WHEN IT

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:24.815
COMES TO ENFORCING AND

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.417
RESPONDING TO WATER QUALITY

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:28.052
CHALLENGES ALONG WITH SOME OF

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:28.786
THE NUMBER OF OUR SISTER

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:31.455
AGENCIES- THAT HANDLE

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.723
PESTICIDES AND TOXICS AS WELL

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.192

AUTHORITIES ARE AND WHAT CASES

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.833
THE BOARD CAN HELP WHEN IT

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.769
COMES TO ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.370

THAT THE WATER GROUND WATER

00:36:54.111 --> 00:36:55.212
CONTAMINATION BECAUSE MY

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.381
DISTRICT IS VERY VERY CONCERNED

00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.816
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THAT

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.151
CHEMICAL THAT THEY FEEL IS

00:37:00.217 --> 00:37:01.652
GOING INTO THE GROUND WATER.

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:04.155
AND THAT'S MY DESERT COMMUNITY

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:05.489
I ALSO REPRESENT THE SECOND

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:06.824
LARGEST FOOD PRODUCING COUNTY

00:37:06.891 --> 00:37:09.327
IN THE WORLD A KERN COUNTY AND

00:37:09.393 --> 00:37:11.228
IN TULARE COUNTY IS THIRD

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:13.431
FRESNO IS FIRST. BUT WE KIND OF

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.498
STAIR STEP DOWN THE CENTRAL

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.033
VALLEY IN THIS RECENT WATER

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.269
TRUMP KERR ACREE TELLEMENT-

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:23.107
ORDERS BY THE STDC RCB HAS.

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.542
KIND OF PUT SOME OF OUR GROWERS

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:25.810
IN A LITTLE BIT OF A PANIC IN

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.678
SO I JUST WONDERED WHEN

00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.113
DECISIONS ARE MADE LIKE THIS

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.048
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LIST IN

00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:32.049
FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:33.818
PROVIDE IT TO YOU. THERE ARE

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:35.419
SEVERAL COMMODITIES GROWN

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:36.587
COMMODITIES THAT ARE GROWN IN

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:42.460
THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE GROW.

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.628
99% OF THAT FOOD SOURCE. 99% OF

00:37:43.694 --> 00:37:45.896
ALMONDS THE LONG. STASHED USE

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:46.897
NINETY NINE. OF THE CUTIES THE

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:50.134
HALOS. M. 99% OF SEVERAL

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:52.036
DIFFERENT I THINK THERE'S OVER

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.205
FORTY COMMODITIES THAT WE GROW.

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.740
IF WE DON'T GROW THOSE

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.942
COMMODITIES IT ACTUALLY AND I

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.377
KNOW IT SOUNDS KIND OF

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.645
OUTLANDISH BUT IF YOU THINK

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:03.180
ABOUT IT. JUST BASIC AND SIMPLE

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.582
IF WE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR

00:38:04.649 --> 00:38:06.684
THAT WE GROW YOU KNOW 99% EASE

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:07.918
PRODUCTS AND WE DON'T GROW

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:09.420
THEM. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:11.389
ACCESS TO WATER WHICH IS

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:13.424
REQUIRED TO ALLOW THEM TO GROW.

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.660
AND WHAT HOW DOES THAT DISRUPT

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:18.796
THE FOOD SUPPLY AND ARE YOU. IN

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:20.197
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER STATES

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:20.865
IN THE NATION OR THE

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:23.067
ADMINISTRATION. REGARDING A

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.402
POSSIBLE DISRUPTION OF THE FOOD

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:25.670
SUPPLY FOR THESE COMMODITIES

00:38:25.736 --> 00:38:27.938
ARE ONLY GROWN IN THE CENTRAL

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:28.506
VALLEY THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:31.208
WATER. THANK YOU SENATOR YEAH

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:32.810
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.045
DROUGHT AND THE PRESSURES THAT

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.012
IT'S PUTTING ON ALL OF OUR

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.547
COMMUNITIES AND THE AG SECTOR

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:39.483
IS VERY FRONT OF MIND AND- YOU

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.619
KNOW WE AT THE BOARD- WHEN IT

00:38:41.686 --> 00:38:43.154
COMES TO CURTAILMENT. I THINK

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.789
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. IF

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:46.957
THE BOARD DIDN'T CURTAIL IT

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:47.491
WOULD MEANT THAT WE WOULD

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:49.560
CONTINUE TO SEE. PEOPLE PULLING

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.628
WATER OUT OF THE SYSTEM THAT

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:52.129
THEY DON'T HAVE REAL LEGAL

00:38:52.196 --> 00:38:55.199
RIGHT TO AND- I THINK THAT- AND

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.001
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS CAN

00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.569
BE THAT THE BOARD'S ACTION

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.905
ITSELF. THAT CAN LEAD TO THESE

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:02.039
THESE THESE CHALLENGES THESE

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:03.874
ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO-

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:06.277
DESTRUCTION OR JUST TRULY THEY

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:08.012
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND-

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.747
IMPACT THAT HAS ON ON LOCAL

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:12.750
COMMUNITIES- WHEN. THOSE TAX

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:14.852
REVENUES IN THOSE JOBS AREN'T

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:15.986
THERE IN THE AG SECTOR BECAUSE

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:19.256
OF DROUGHT- AND SO KNOW THAT

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:21.358
YOU KNOW I VERY MUCH YOUR THE

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.393
FRUSTRATION OF THE BOARD'S

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.329
ACTIONS. AND A FEELING THAT

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:27.531
THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THESE

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.400
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES BUT I

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:30.401
THINK WE HAVE TO AGAIN REMEMBER

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:32.403
THAT. THE PROUDEST IS CAUSING

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.371
INORDINATE AMOUNT OF IMPACT IN

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:36.040
OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK WE HAVE

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.742
TO BE READY TO RESPOND AND SO.

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.744
THERE I THINK WE DO NEED TO SEE

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.313
SUPPORT FOR A BI I COMMUNITY

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:43.547
SAID TO WHETHER THIS DROUGHT

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:45.082
BUT IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:45.716
CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE LONG

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:48.252
TERM. ON HOW WE CAN BEST

00:39:48.319 --> 00:39:50.254
IMPLEMENT SIGMOD IN A WAY THAT

00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.023
IT IS FAIR BUT RECOGNIZES THAT.

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.458
WE WE'VE MET OUR PHYSICAL

00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:56.160
LIMITS IN MANY WAYS IN THE

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.829
STATE AND NEED TO. BEGIN TO

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.297
REALLY RESPOND TO AN

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.233
ACKNOWLEDGE- THE CLIMATE CRISIS

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:04.802
THAT WE HAVE. SO WHEN IT COMES

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.070
TO FOOD AND DISRUPTION OR THE

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.204
POSSIBILITY OF THIS DROUGHT

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.806
WHICH IS WEST WIDE AS YOU KNOW

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:12.710
SENATOR- AND WHAT THAT MEANS-

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.545
I. IT IS FURTHER DISCUSSION TO

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:15.980
HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE FLAG

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:20.985
ON THAT- AND WOOD. REMEMBER

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:22.353

ACTUALLY WE BASS MANAGE THROUGH

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.823
DIFFICULT TIMES LIKE DROUGHT IN

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:28.125
A WAY THAT- DOESN'T JUST LEAVE

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.226
US AS HONOR A RACE TO THE

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:32.229
BOTTOM- AND WE HAVE TO. BE VERY

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:33.697
AWARE AND ACKNOWLEDGING

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.132
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AND

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.801
IMPACTS FOR COMMUNITIES AND

00:40:36.867 --> 00:40:37.935
RESPOND TO THEM. AND SUPPORT

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.637

OUR CURTAILMENT ORDERS WHICH

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.439
HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR HUMAN

HOW. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:05.856
PRETENDING WE DIDN'T MEET

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.024
STORAGE TARGETS AND IT'S TO

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:09.393
PREVENT DOWNSTREAM CITIES FROM

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.527
BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THE

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:11.362
RIVER AND THEIR SOURCE OF

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:13.130
WATER- SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.565
THAT IN IN BEING PROTECTED IN

00:42:14.632 --> 00:42:15.733
THE WATER RIGHT SPACE

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:17.501
ADDITIONALLY THERE IS I KNOW

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.637
DISCUSSION I AND THIS IS MORE

WITH OUR OPERATORS OF THE STATE

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.573
WATER PROJECT WE HAVE THE

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.041
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REALLY MOVE

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:25.709
WATER AROUND IN THE STATE. AND

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.611

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:32.583
DISCUSSION OUT THERE ARE MONTHS

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.685
URBAN'S AROUND THE POTENTIAL

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:35.753
FOR A WATER BANK IF YOU WILL IN

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.288
THERE YOUR POINT IT'S YOU KNOW

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.223
HOW BEST TO. HAVE A POOL OF

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.491
WATER AT LEAST FOR THOSE THAT

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:41.258
ARE CONNECTED TO THE STATE

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:43.627
WATER PROJECT- IN ORDER TO

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.596
ACCESS AND IN THESE DIFFICULT

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:48.165

OUR CALVET ORDERS HUMAN HEALTH

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.871
AND SAFETY EXEMPTION SO THAT

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:56.340
CITIES ARE ARE PRIORITIZED AND

00:42:56.407 --> 00:43:02.212
IF YOU WILL AND. IN THEIR

00:43:02.279 --> 00:43:02.947
ACCESS IN THE WATERS. NO

PROBLEM MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.082
THE QUESTION TO- THERE'S A

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:07.017
WATER BREAK IN MY- I KNOW YOU

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:08.519
PROBABLY ARE AWARE OF THAT. AND

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:09.186
WATER MAKING MY DISTRICT

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.587
SOMEBODY STERN LYNDA RESNICK

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:11.956
AND- THEY'VE BEEN DRINKING

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:15.492
WATER FOR. QUITE AWHILE AND- SO

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:17.027
ANOTHER THING THAT I HAD THAT I

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:20.364
WANTED TO ASK YOU IS- YOU KNOW

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.532
ONE OF THE MAIN COMPLAINTS THAT

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.834
I GET FROM MY GROWERS- IN MY

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.637
FARMERS THAT PRODUCE FOOD IS A-

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:28.672
THE ISSUE THAT. EVEN THOUGH

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.940
THIS CURTAILMENT THERE ARE

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:31.809
UNDER CONTRACT WHERE THEY PAY A

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:33.711
CERTAIN OLLAR AMOUNT AND

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:34.345
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ENTITLED

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:35.512
TO A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WATER.

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.114
BUT EVEN THOUGH THE WATER HAS

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.849
OVER THELAST FEW YEARS BEEN

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:40.584
CUT BACK THEY STILL HAVE TO PAY

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.419
FOR THAT WATER. A PERFECT

00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:43.821
EXAMPLE IS LIKE GOING TO THE

00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:45.189
GROCERY STORE AND PUT IN A

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:46.190
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.191
GROCERIES ON THE ON THE BELT

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.460
AND- PAYING FOR THAT GETTING IT

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:50.761
BACKED UP AND THEN WALKING OUT

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:52.896
WITH NOTHING- IN THIS CASE OR

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.499
5% OF WHAT YOU PURCHASED. IS

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.668
THERE AN- IT'S KIND OF IT I

00:43:57.735 --> 00:43:58.802
KNOW IT'S A LOADED QUESTION

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.771
BUT- IS THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.207
GOING ON TO REDUCE THE- PRICE

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:05.743
THAT- OUR WATER USERS ARE END

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:07.277
USERS ARE PAIN. SINCE THEY'RE

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.613
NOT GETTING THE WATER IT THEY

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.316
WERE PROMISED TO GET. AT THANK

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:15.152
YOU I IMPORTANT HERE- TED TO

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:15.986
DIFFERENTIATE THAT THERE ARE

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:17.755
THOSE THAT ARE ON PROJECT WATER

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.523
SO EITHER A LOCAL PROJECT FOR

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.025
THE STATE WATER PROJECT OR THE

00:44:21.091 --> 00:44:22.526
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT- OR TWO

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:23.727
MAIN PROJECTS OR THEY'RE

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:24.895
DIVERTING STRAIGHT FROM A

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:25.996
STREAM. AND THEN HAVE A WATER

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.898
RIGHT- THAT WE'VE WE'VE

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.900
CURTAILED AND SO THAT I KNOW

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.568
THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR SOME

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:32.970
YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY MAY

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:33.904
HAVE A WATER RIGHT THEY MAY BE

00:44:33.971 --> 00:44:35.205
DIVERTED THAT IS NOW CUT OFF

00:44:35.272 --> 00:44:36.974
AND IN A YEAR LIKE THIS. THE

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.609
CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT ON FOR

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:40.944
SOME OF ITS ITS CONTRACTORS

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.014
THERE AT 0% ALLOCATION- THOSE

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.482
ISSUES OF THE PRICE OF THAT

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:46.717
CONTRACT WATER WITH THOSE

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.986
PROJECTS. THEIR THERE LONG

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.688
TERM- YEP ABILITY TO DELIVER

00:44:51.755 --> 00:44:53.257
THOSE AMOUNTS KNOW WHAT IT

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:55.459
MEANS FOR THAT THE CONTRACTORS

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:56.760
ON THIS PROJECT SO THAT I CAN

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:58.429
TRUST AND CITIES ARE OFTEN

00:44:58.495 --> 00:45:01.365
TIMES- IS AN ISSUE UNLESS THE

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:03.267
BOARD'S PURVIEW THOUGH- BUT IT

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.701
IS SOMETHING THAT WE- ARE ARE

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.537
AWARE OF AND- AND- IS PART OF

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.772
THIS. DISCUSSION I READ LARGE

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.107
AROUND HOW BEST WE ARE MANAGING

00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:12.776
OUR WATERS- BUT JUST IMPORTANT

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.678
TO NOTE THAT THE ACTIVITIES OR

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.413
THE ACTION OF THE BOARD AGREED

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.249
TELLING. WATER RIGHTS- IS

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.684
TANGENTIALLY CONNECTED TO THAT

00:45:20.751 --> 00:45:22.052
THE ISSUES ARE BROUGHT UP WHEN

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.987
IT COMES TO. GROWERS PAYING FOR

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.789
WATER NOT RECEIVING IT THROUGH

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:28.258
THERE THERE THERE'S BETTER- THE

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:31.361
PROJECTS- AND YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:32.863
WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF AND

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.831
WORKING WITH ONE ANOTHER IN

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.566
THAT SPACE AND- A LOT OF THAT

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.701
IS WITH THE PROJECT MANAGERS AT

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.303
THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IN

00:45:39.369 --> 00:45:40.871
THE STATE WATER PROJECT WORK.

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.039
SOME OF THOSE OTHER LOCAL

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:43.841
PROJECTS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.410
TIME. WITH CERTAINTY IN

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.278

SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME. SO

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:56.386
THERE'S A NEW BIOLOGICAL

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.355
OPINION OUT THERE- THAT CAME

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.090
OUT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO- A-

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:02.192
ON OUTFLOWS THAT WOULD GENERATE

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.161
MORE RESEARCH MORE. RESOURCES

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:06.797
IN WATER RESOURCES TO THAT

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:07.664
GROUND I GUESS STATE OF

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:14.004
CALIFORNIA DO. IT REGARDLESS OF

IMPORTANTLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:42.866
PROJECT AND SO THOSE BIOLOGICAL

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:45.402
OPINIONS DICTATED AND WERE

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:47.304
FIRST DEVELOPED- YOU KNOW WELL

THE LATE AT 200-020-0072

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:56.079
THOUSAND EIGHT. WAS WHEN. ONE

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:57.814
OF THE REAL BIOLOGICAL OBJECTS

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.082
FOR CAME IN WERE PUT INTO PLACE

00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:00.951
THE REPLACED AS HE SAID. TWO

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.391
DISCUSSIONS GOING ON WITH THE

KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING ON.

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:14.231
AND REGARDING WHAT TO DO

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.832
REGARDING THEIR LAWSUIT THAT

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.601
THE STATE ENDED UP. TRIGGERING

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:20.003
LAST YEAR- WHEN THOSE

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.339
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WENT INTO-

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:23.607
WHEN INTO A FACT AND THE

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:24.641
DISAGREEMENT THAT THE STATE

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:28.212
HAD. ON THEM- SO- ALL THAT TO

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.680
SAY THAT I BELIEVE THOSE

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.281
BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM TWO

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.816
YEARS AGO ARE STILL. UP FOR

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.151
DISCUSSION CURRENTLY MY

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.253
OPINIONS ON THE MARK. IN THEIR-

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.521
FEDERAL THERE AND ENDANGERED

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.456
SPECIES ACT I'M REALLY FOCUSED

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.891
ACTUALLY ON MAKING SURE THAT

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:41.925
OUR WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:44.595
UPDATE. IS UPDATED I THINK IT'S

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.730
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:47:46.797 --> 00:47:48.465
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS ONE-

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.467
STANDARD IS AN EMERGENCY ROOM

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.502
APPROACH TO OUR CHALLENGES. WE

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.504
NEED REALLY- A WHOLE OF SYSTEM

00:47:54.571 --> 00:47:57.140
WATER SHED WHY. APPROACH TO THE

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.508
CHALLENGES THAT OUR SPECIES AND

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:00.444
ECOSYSTEMS ARE FACING. BECAUSE

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.412
IT'S AN OVER OVER FOCUSING ON

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:03.547
JUST WHAT THE PROJECTS ARE

00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:06.350
DOING AT THE PUMPS- THAT IS IN

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:08.819
PART. WHY WEEK WE NEED TO AND

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:09.920
WE HAVEN'T HAD AS MUCH PROGRESS

00:48:09.987 --> 00:48:12.189
I FEEL IN THE REST OF THE WATER

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:12.923
SENSE THAT WE NEED AND SO LOOK

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.658
FORWARD TO. TEACHING US ALL

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.326
TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT MAKES

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:19.062
MOST SENSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:48:22.899 --> 00:48:24.601
WHOLE OF THE WATER SYSTEM

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:32.075
ITSELF. AND THE LAST. QUESTION

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:32.643
I HAVE IS THERE IS THERE IS

00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:33.744
SAM. AS WE WATER S. WATER. TO

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:34.344
IN THIS VALLEY THEY A LOT OF

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.178
INTO. THROUGHOUT STATE HAVE

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.847
GUARD. A NEW TECHNOLOGY I KNOW

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.048
YOU'RE AVAILABLE YOU'RE

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.182
FAMILIAR WITH THE QUEEN THE

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.684
WATER PROJECT- WHERE THEY'VE

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:42.286
TAKEN PRODUCE WATER BLENDED IN

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:44.821
MADE ACT WATER. WHICH IS- MEETS

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.156
THE WATER BOARD'S STANDARDS AND

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:48.025
THEN THERE'S- THERE'S- OTHER

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.092
WATER THAT'S BEEN PRODUCED

00:48:49.159 --> 00:48:50.260
WATER THAT'S BEEN APPROVED BY

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:51.128
THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

00:48:51.194 --> 00:48:52.863
CONTROL BOARD. THAT IT'S KIND

00:48:52.929 --> 00:48:54.264
OF I GUESS THE BEST WAY TO

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:55.599
EXPLAIN IT IT'S NOT A REVERSE

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.800
OSMOSIS SYSTEM BUT IT'S LIKE

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.669
THAT. IT ACTUALLY GOES INTO

00:48:58.735 --> 00:48:59.536
MINES ALL THE MINERALS THAT ARE

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.238
IN THE WATER. OF BORON AND

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:04.007
THINGS LIKE THAT- TO REMOVE IT

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:06.043
M. AND THEN HAVE THE WATER THAT

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:07.844
EXCEEDS THE STANDARDS- FROM

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:09.413
STATE WATER BOARD. THERE'S A

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.681
LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.783
IS ARE YOU OR YOUR TEAM OR DO

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.284

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:32.836
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA OR IS

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:33.337
THAT. SOMETHING THAT YOU

LEAST FOR ME VERY TOP OF MIND.

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:40.010
WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:42.412
INNOVATION UNIT OR- TEAM IF YOU

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.181
WELL THAT IS JUST FOCUSED ON

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.449
TECHNOLOGIES BUT OUR DIVISION

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:48.151
OF DRINKING WATER. IT IS THE

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.252
REGULATORY ARM THAT WOULD

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:51.221
APPROVE ANYTHING THAT ANY NEW

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.689

MEET STANDARDS AND OF DELIVER

00:49:56.259 --> 00:49:57.861
DRINKING WATER ANY SYSTEM THAT.

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.629
WOULD LIKE TO SERVE INNOVATOR

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:00.697
OR HAVE SOMETHING IMPROVE WOULD

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:01.531
GO THROUGH THE DIVISION OF

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.266
DRINKING WATER. I HAVE HAD.

00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:05.001
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR OUR-

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.303
DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER HAD

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.038
TERRAPLANE MESSED. AROUND HOW

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:10.040
WE CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE TO

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.675
YOUR POINT. NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:13.877
AND CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.712
WE'RE INNOVATING IN THE SPACE

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:17.781
OF DELIVERY OF CLEAN WATER. AND

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:18.415
WASTE AND HOPEFULLY BRING DOWN

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:20.517
THE COST- AND YES YOU KNOW

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:21.918
REVERSE OSMOSIS IS OUT THERE

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:23.820
IT'S A- TRIED AND TRUE. BUT IT

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.155
IS ENERGY INTENSIVE IT IS COST

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.857
INTENSIVE IN SHAREPOINT. THERE

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:30.994
ARE. I THINK INNOVATIONS. BEING

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:32.162
BEING PULLED TOGETHER. IT WITH

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.764
PACE IF LIKE LEAST BEEN READING

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.965
AND TRYING TO KEEP ON TOP OF

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.466
THE LITERATURE. THE QUESTION IS

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:37.768
HOW HOW DOES THAT BECOME

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:38.802
IMPLEMENTABLE HOW DOES IT

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:39.569
BECOME SOMETHING THAT'S

00:50:39.636 --> 00:50:41.571

OUR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND-

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.076
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION WE DON'T

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:47.811
LIKE I SAID AS I UNDERSTAND.

00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.679

00:53:45.188 --> 00:53:47.457
KNOWLEDGE MEANT. WHEN IT COMES

00:53:47.524 --> 00:53:49.392
TO THE THAT SMALL SYSTEMS IN

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.627
THE STATE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:53.263
STATE BOARD I BELIEVE IN WITH

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:54.030
SOMEWHERE AROUND OVER THREE

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.032
THOUSAND. I SYSTEMS THAT WE

00:53:56.099 --> 00:53:57.500
OVERSEE AND THE STATE AND SOME

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:59.202
OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW OUR OUR

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:01.004
LARGE URBAN AGENCIES AND YOUR

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:03.273
POINT. TOO MANY ARE SMALL

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.408
STRUGGLING SYSTEMS. I THINK

00:54:05.475 --> 00:54:06.643
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.378
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELP US

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.080
BUILD OUT MANY OF OUR SYSTEMS.

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:12.215
I HAD IT WAS WITH GREAT FEDERAL

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.117
INVESTMENT SUBSIDY AND SUPPORT

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:15.018
THAT OUR WASTE WATER AND

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:16.720
DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AFTER

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:17.320
THE PASSAGE OF THE CLEAN WATER

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.589
ACT AND- SAFE DRINKING WATER

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:22.726
ACT- WERE WERE WERE BUILT OUT.

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.260
AND THAT IT WAS REALLY IN THE

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.695
EIGHTIES AND THE START OF THE

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.697
EIGHTIES THIS- THIS THIS

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:29.366
PROGRESSION FROM INVESTMENT.

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.334
FROM ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AND

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.903
INSTEAD OF SHIFTING TO. LOCAL

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:36.640
REPAIRS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.274
AND IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE ACT

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:39.042
YOU EITHER AND THAT THE

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.977
COMMUNITY OF SIZE TO BE ABLE TO

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:43.179
MAINTAIN. AND CONTINUE DELIVER

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:45.882
AND REINVEST IN AND OUR OUR

BEER DRINKING WATER

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.584
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTINUE TO

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:49.786
MAINTAIN. A LEVEL OF SERVICE OR

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.855
NOT. AND WE HAVE TOO MANY

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.289
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE OR

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:55.125
NOT CATEGORY IN FACT THE STATE

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.760
WATER BOARD RECENTLY CONDUCTED

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.294
A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IT'S NOW A

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:00.597
YEARLY JUST ONGOING ASSESSMENT

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:01.865
OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:03.700
NEEDS OF OUR SYSTEMS. IT

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.035
INCLUDED ALL OF OUR DOMESTIC

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.569
WELLS IN THE STATE ALL STATES

00:55:06.636 --> 00:55:08.071
MALLS MEETING THEIR UNDER

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.873
FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS. AND THEN

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:13.109
THOSE THAT ARE UNDER THIRTY

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:13.710
THREE HUNDRED CONNECTIONS AND

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:16.012
WHAT WE FOUND WERE WELL OVER

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.013
SIX HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT WERE

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.249
AT RISK. WE WOULD TERM AT RISK

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.317
OFF OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS AND

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.385
METHODOLOGIES I ENCOURAGE

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:24.020
EVERYONE TO TAKE  LOOK AT THAT

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:29.726
DOCUMENT IT IS. AN INCREDIBLE-

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:32.095
FIRST I ROLLED. DIVE INTO SEEN

00:55:32.162 --> 00:55:33.963
OUR- DATA INFORMATION IS SOLD

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.665
TEMP. PART OF THIS RISK.

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:36.900
BECAUSE IF WE KNOW THE STATUS

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:37.867
OF THE SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:38.835
THAT THEY'RE AT RISK FOR

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.770
FAILING AND WE DON'T. GET TO

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:42.539
THEM BEFORE THEY FAIL WE HAVE A

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.374
SYSTEM IN PLACE IT IS IT IS

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:46.042
REACTIONARY TO THIS THIS CRISIS

00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:47.944
AND THIS CHALLENGE. AS OPPOSED

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:49.446
TO MAKING ACCORDING FOR THE

00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:51.514
INVESTMENTS WE NEED. SO WE'RE

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:52.949
FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE SAFE AND

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.417
AFFORDABLE FUND THAT'S THE

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:55.185
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:55.852
A YEAR THAT THE STATE

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:57.921
LEGISLATURE. PROVIDED THE STATE

00:55:57.987 --> 00:55:59.155
BOARD TO HELP START TO CLOSE

00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:00.457
THIS GAP TO SPEND IT ON

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.092
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. TO

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:03.660
HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:05.128
BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND I

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.429
THINK I. MAY HAVE MADE THIS

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:08.264
POINT- BEFORE IT IS JUST THAT

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.333
WE- YOU HAVE THAT THE PROGRAMS

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.001
THAT WE HAVE. USUALLY BEST

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.470
SERVE THOSE LARGER SYSTEMS AND

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:15.238
IT'S THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:15.772
NEED MORE THESE TECHNICAL

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.407
ASSISTANCE DOLLARS. EVEN GOT A

00:56:17.474 --> 00:56:19.008
PROJECT TO CONSTRUCTION THEY

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:20.477
GOT A TO A POINT WHERE THEY CAN

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:21.945
RECEIVE YOU KNOW PART OF THE

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:22.946
ONE POINT THREE BILLION THAT WE

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:24.581
JUST RECENTLY. RECEIVED THE

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:25.381
STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:26.883
GOVERNOR TO INVESTING CAPITAL

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.918
SO. I FEEL WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:30.153
OPPORTUNITY HERE TRULY IS A

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.822
GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY. TO

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.491
REVERSE WHAT IS THIS TREND OF

00:56:34.557 --> 00:56:36.226
SMALL FAILING SYSTEMS. AND

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.594
INSTEAD ENSURE THAT OUR

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.596
COMMUNITIES I HAVE ACCESS TO

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:40.997
CLEAN AND SAFE WATER HERE INTO

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:42.665
THE FUTURE AND UNDERSTAND. IT

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.033
IT'S ALMOST A DIFFERENT SERVICE

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.703
MODEL IT'S A DIFFERENT PROGRAM

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.104
ALL TOGETHER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:50.306
OUR FOR SMALLER. SYSTEMS THAT

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:52.208
THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:54.210
GO TO. THE USUAL YOU KNOW

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.111
PROGRAMS LIKE THE STATE

00:56:55.178 --> 00:57:00.650
REVOLVING FUND OR. IS OTHER

00:57:00.717 --> 00:57:02.318
PROGRAMS THAT- THE FEDERAL.

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:02.952
HASN'T REALLY KEPT UP IN THE-

00:57:03.019 --> 00:57:04.587
ON IN AS MANY THAT. SYSTEMS

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.156
COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE NATION

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.390
AND IN THE STATE HAVE BEGUN TO

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:08.558
FALL TO THE CRACKS AND THAT'S

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.059
WHERE. WE CAN JUST SO PROUD OF

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:11.628
THE WORK THE STATE HAS DONE.

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:12.962
WITH THE SECOND AFFORDABLE FUN

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:16.332
WITH THE SAFER PROGRAM. TO BE

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:17.801
ABLE TO REALLY REVERSES KIND.

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.068
WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT IT

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:20.837
SEEMS LIKE YOU YOU HAVE A

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:22.972
VISION FOR HOW THE STATE CAN

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.909
BEGIN TO BALANCE- THE NEEDS AND

00:57:25.975 --> 00:57:27.544
THE CHALLENGES. OF THE HAVE

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.780
NOTS- VERSUS THE HABS. AND

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:32.515
SOMETIMES HOW YOU DEFINE HAES

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:33.850
AND HAVE NOTS MAY BE VERY

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.819
DIFFERENT BUT I THINK WE HAVE

00:57:35.885 --> 00:57:38.488
TO BE REALLY. FAIR AND JUST

00:57:38.555 --> 00:57:39.689
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:41.257
HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS. AS IT

00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:42.592
RELATES TO WATER WHICH IS

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:46.396
INCREDIBLY- CRITICAL. RESOURCE

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:48.164
YOU KNOW I ALWAYS WONDER LIKE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.033
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU KNOW

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:51.267
ARMAGEDDON HITS ARE WE GOING TO

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:54.137
pWATER WORLD AND IT SEEMS LIKE

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.172
WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS MAD MAX

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:58.741
WHICH IS. INCREDIBLY SCARY-

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.777
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS TENSION

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:03.746
BETWEEN. WATER RELIABILITY AND

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:05.715
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:06.816
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:09.219
ABOUT IN LOS ANGELES. I KNOW

00:58:09.285 --> 00:58:10.420
IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.222
THOUGHT ABOUT- IN THE CENTRAL

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:14.757
VALLEY. AS WELL- AND IN

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:16.626
NORTHERN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:17.660
AND I KNOW THAT THE BOARD HAS

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.362
UNDERTAKEN. YOU KNOW MANY

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:21.664
ACTIONS TO PROTECT FISHERIES

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.900
AND THE ENVIRONMENT- WE DON'T

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.068
HAVE A LOT OF FISHERIES IN LOS

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.070
ANGELES SO I AM. INSTEAD OF

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:28.938
HONING FOR A FRIEND I'M ASKING

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.474
FOR A FRIEND- AND IMPROVED

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:32.575
CONDITIONS FOR FISH AND

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.110
WILDLIFE RESTORATION ARE

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:37.247
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GOALS- I

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:38.581
KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:40.583
EXPECT TO SEE. EVEN MORE

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.318
FREQUENT AND LONGER LASTING

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:45.088
DRAFTS I FEEL LIKE WE SORT OF

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:45.722
ONCE WE AND ONE WERE IN ANOTHER

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:48.424
ONE. AND SO WANTED TO KNOW AND-

00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:49.893
IF YOU SUPPORT VOLUNTARY

00:58:49.959 --> 00:58:52.662
AGREEMENTS- AS A WAY TO BALANCE

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:55.965
THE NEEDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:58.534
AND WATER SUPPLY RELIABILITY.

00:58:58.601 --> 00:59:00.203
YES YEAH I MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.873
AT THE ENORMITY OF THE WORK AND

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.408
TASK THAT WE ALL HAVE IN OUR

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.610
WATERSHEDS IF YOU. TO ADDRESS

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.646
THE CLIMATE CRISIS TO ENSURE

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:12.148
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN CAN

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:13.983
THRIVE INTO THE FUTURE HERE

00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:15.885
KNOWING- THE CHALLENGES AT WORK

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.654
WE'RE HEARING TRACING. IT

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.390
REQUIRES LOCALS WITH LOCAL

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:22.392
LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE TO OWN

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.027
THIS CHALLENGE AND COME TO THE

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:26.696
STATE WITH WITH. WITH WORK WITH

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:29.732
AGREEMENT ON ON HOW BEST TO

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:30.900
MOVE FORWARD. BUT IT'S

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:33.102
IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS KNOW THAT

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.570
YOU KNOW VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:35.672
NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING TO AIM

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.840
TOWARD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:41.144
WE ALSO SET THE BAR TO WHICH

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.980
AGREEMENTS MEET AND THEN WE CAN

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.748
SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT YES

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.383
THIS VOLUNTARY EFFORT IS

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:49.752
PROTECTED. ISN'T HIS ENSURING

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.587
THIS COMMON OUTCOME THAT WE ARE

00:59:51.654 --> 00:59:53.589
ALL DESIRING. I FEEL SOMETIMES

00:59:53.656 --> 00:59:55.525
THERE'S JUST SOMETIMES A FALSE

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:56.492
DICHOTOMY THAT'S THAT'S PLACED

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:58.561
BEFORE WHAT'S REGULATORY

00:59:58.628 --> 01:00:00.830
WORKING WITH A VOLUNTARY ACTION

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:01.431
AND I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY A

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:04.600
CONTINUAL. EFFORT BETWEEN THE

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.535
TWO AND ALL TOGETHER IT'S ABOUT

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:06.970
THE OUTCOMES IT'S ABOUT THE

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:08.338
COMMON OUTCOMES THAT I THINK WE

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.306
ALL SEE AND WANT FOR A

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.542
COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS ACCESS TO

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.277
CLEAN WATER WHICH IS CONTINUED

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.913
ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND VIABILITY

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:20.416
AND TO PROVIDE. A COMMON A GOOD

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:23.453

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.301
WHILE ALSO HELPING FOLKS

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.536
UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.839
WATER RELIABILITY- AND THE

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.574
CRITICAL ILLNESS OF MAKING SURE

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.376
THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE ON TO

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.912

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.591
ARE PATHWAYS THROUGH IT BUT I

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.293
THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.462
ROSS US ALL TO BE JUST BE. VERY

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:13.563

WE'RE FACING. AND TO REALLY

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.567
RECOGNIZE THAT WERE RECONCILING

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:18.468
A SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL

01:02:18.534 --> 01:02:20.837
INHERITED. WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.572

INFRASTRUCTURE IN TWENTY FIRST

01:02:24.607 --> 01:02:26.776
CENTURY CHALLENGES. AND THE

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:28.744
REALITY IS THAT WE BUILT OUT SO

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:31.114
MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE. FOR A

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.515
CLIMATE THAT NO LONGER EXISTS

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.784
SIMPLY NO LONGER EXISTS. AND

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.853
RECONCILING THAT FACT

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:39.088
RECONCILING THESE INVESTMENTS

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.890
AND ENSURING THAT THE

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:41.724
INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE NOW CAN

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.359
START TO. MOVE TOWARD THE

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.062
REALITY OF. A CALIFORNIA WITH

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.364
THE REDUCED IMPACT. INCREASING

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.366
AND LONGER DROUGHTS FLASH

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.635
FLOODS RISING SEA NEEDS. WE'RE

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:54.403
GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.906
THINK OCT HERE AND RECOGNIZE

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:57.907
THAT THE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.876
NOW ARE SENDING US ON A PATH

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.677
FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. AND

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:04.180
THAT WE NEED TO ACT JUST BE

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.448
HONEST WITH OURSELVES WITH THE

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.516
ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGES WE

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:09.585
FACE. AND I FEEL NOW I'LL JUST

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.387
SAY CANDIDLY THAT OFTENTIMES

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.955
SOME ARE STILL CLINGING TO THE

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:15.691
STATUS QUO. THAT AGAIN

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.326
REGRETTABLY IS NO LONGER HERE.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.262
OUR CLIMATE HAS CHANGED OUR

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.563
WATER SYSTEMS WERE BUILT FOR A

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.430
DIFFERENT CENTURY IN A

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:22.832
DIFFERENT TIME AND WE'RE GONNA

THINKING LET ALONE A

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:31.974
GENERATIONAL REINVESTMENT. IN

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:32.942
THE SYSTEMS THEMSELVES. AMEN

AROUND CERTAINLY AND THE

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.452
CLIMATE CRISIS YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:51.487
FEELING IT- IT'S HERE BUT SO

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.256
ARE THE RACIAL INEQUALITY SAID

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:56.392
THAT WE SEE AND WE CAN WE- NEED

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.527
TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND BY SENIOR

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:01.230

UNDERSTAND AND AN ADDRESS. YOU

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:05.835
KNOW HI IT I'LL JUST SAY THAT.

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.837
RACE ISN'T AN EASY THING TO

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.272
TALK ABOUT RACIAL INEQUALITIES

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.341
AND INEQUITY IS NOT A SIMPLE

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:13.643
DISCUSSION FOR ANYONE FOR

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.711
MYSELF- I KNOW I CARRY MY OWN

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.014
BIAS SEES LIFE I AM. I AM PROUD

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.916
OF MYSELF IN PERFECT BUT ALSO

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:22.351
THAT AS GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:23.953
IT'S NOT AN EASY THING CUT

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:25.354
UNDERTAKEN DISCUSSION AROUND

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.490
RACIAL INEQUALITY. BUT I THINK

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.125
THAT NOT UNLIKE CLIMATE CHANGE

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.726
AND THE OBVIOUSNESS OF THE

01:05:30.793 --> 01:05:32.662
LANDS FROM WHICH IMPACTS ALL OF

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.330
OUR WORK AND THEN THE NEED TO

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.632
UNDERSTAND IT CUT. TO FIGURE IT

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:38.701
OUT TO THEN NAVIGATE AND MANAGE

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.636
THROUGH IT SO TOO I FEEL ARE

01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:41.637
THE CHALLENGES OF THE RACIAL

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:42.938
INEQUITIES AND INEQUALITIES

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.740
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES WITH.

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:45.675
AND SO THE BOARD HAS

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.377
UNDERTAKEN- RACIAL EQUITY-

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.446
INITIATIVE AND PART OF THAT IS

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:51.314
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.749
RESOLUTION- AND IMPORTANTLY

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.618
IT'S TAKEN US A YEAR TO

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.887
ACTUALLY DRAFT IT AND BECAUSE

01:05:57.953 --> 01:05:59.622
WE'VE NEEDED TO OURSELVES HAVE

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.858
CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT THE ISSUE

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:03.859
AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:09.932
IS AN ISSUE INTO IT INTO ALSO.

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:10.566
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- SOME MAY NOT

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:11.967
SEE IT EMISSIONS SOME HAVE HAVE

01:06:12.034 --> 01:06:13.969
SAID THAT BY. RACE OR RACIAL

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.339
INEQUALITY. IF IT IS ITSELF

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:19.842
CREATING- WHICH IS INTERESTING.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.444
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE WHAT

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.213
WE CAN DO- IS TO HAVE A

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.649
DISCUSSION BE MINDFUL THAT

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:29.118
RACIAL INEQUITY INEQUALITY IS.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.087
SUCH A HUGE IMPACT WHEN WE LOOK

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:32.955
AT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACCESS TO

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:33.889
CLEAN WATER ACCESS TO

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:37.226
SANITATION. AND THAT WE NEED TO

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.795
UNDERSTAND. THAT IN ORDER TO

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:41.764
NOT PERPETUATE. THE

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.833
INEQUALITIES THAT WE SEE AND

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.468
HOPEFULLY HELP CONTRIBUTE TO.

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.503
THE EQUITY TO THE SORTS OF

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.871
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT WE WANT

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.107
TO SEE I THINK. IT'S NOT LOST

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.908
ON ME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.810
THAT YOU LOOK BACK FIFTY YEARS

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:56.379
AGO WHEN THE BOARD ITSELF WAS

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:58.180
WAS WAS CREATED UNDER QUARTER

01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.949
CULLEN. YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.250
WATER ACT YOU LOOK AT THE SAFE

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.785
DRINKING WATER ACT. THOSE WERE

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.488
ALSO AND THE DANGER SPECIES ACT

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:06.021
THESE YOU KNOW THESE THESE

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:09.191
REALLY BIG ARE. INCREDIBLE THIS

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.092
IS A LEGISLATION THAT REALLY

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:12.194
SHIFTED THE WAY THAT WE SEE AND

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:13.629
ACKNOWLEDGE OUR CHALLENGES. BUT

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.197
THOSE TWO WERE WERE HAPPENING

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:16.899
AT TEN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT.

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.667
IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS WITH OUR

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.603
DISCUSSION AND THAT RACIAL AND

01:07:20.669 --> 01:07:22.805
INEQUALITY SEGREGATION SO MUCH

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.374
OF. THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:26.976
WERE WERE LEFT IN THE PAST ARE

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.577
STILL A CHALLENGE NOT UNLIKE

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:29.712
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES WE

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.414
SEE TODAY. SO I THINK IT'S

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.582
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO. AS AS

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:35.584
ALL GENERATIONS DUE TO RECOMMIT

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:38.788
OURSELVES. TO WHAT WAS THEN A

MAKE TWO OF TO A POINT I THINK

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.600
THE VICE CHAIR. STARTED TO TALK

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:26.835
ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT. TOOLS IN

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:27.903
THE TOOLBOX OF WHICH

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.538
DESALINATION IS ONE AN

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.573
OBVIOUSLY WORKING THROUGH THE

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.409
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AROUND-

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:37.312
MAKING IT A BETTER JOB. TYPE OF

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:40.649
ODD TOOL- ENVIRONMENTALLY. IN

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:45.454
THIS THE. PARTNER AGENCIES THAT

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:46.555
YOU HAVE TO WORK WHEN THEY'RE-

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:47.256
THAT HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.558
COASTAL. THOUGH WATER QUALITY

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.226
CONTROL BOARD AND I'M NOT SURE

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:54.763
WHO ELSE- IS THAT PROCESS

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.800
GETTING SMOOTHER ARE YOU GIVE

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.134
ME JUST A COUPLE OF SENTENCES

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.737
ON. HOW YOU SEE THAT PER YOU

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.238
KNOW PROCEEDING AT THIS POINT

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.473
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OBVIOUSLY

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.974
WE'LL HEAR THE STORIES WERE

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:08.644
THEY DON'T. GO SO SMOOTHLY BUT

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.013
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. YEAH I

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.581
THINK WE I APPRECIATE THAT

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.082
SENATOR I HAVE TO SAY I THINK

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.851
WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.786
BACKWARD NATION UP- MET SOME

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.022
MONTHS PROJECTS- PROJECTS IN

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:21.256
SOMETIMES GET LOST IN THAT

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.825
PERMIT SHUFFLE IT IS NOT AN

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:25.327
EASY PROCESS- AND I KNOW MY

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.462
MIND GOES TO. THINGS LIKE

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.730
INFRASTRUCTURE DASHBOARDS THAT

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.065
I KNOW WERE DEVELOPED ON THE

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.134
FEDERAL SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:33.869
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.671
ORDER TO ON THEIR SIDE AND

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:36.972
BETTER COORDINATE THAT

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.540
PERMITTING ACTIVITY AMONGST

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.709
NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES. SO I

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.443
THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.278
WE CAN DEFINITELY BE THINKING

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:46.014
ABOUT HOW WE IMPROVE THOSE- AND

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:47.349
YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THESE

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:39.284
THE COMMISSION- IN ADDITION TO

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:40.886
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:42.621
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE-

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:44.890
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND

02:07:44.957 --> 02:07:48.627
OSHA- WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN.

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:51.230
HELPING TO- CROSSING GUIDELINES

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:52.998
FOR THE INDUSTRY- OF COURSE

02:07:53.065 --> 02:07:54.566
THEY HAVE THE HARDSHIP LIKE

02:07:54.633 --> 02:07:55.134
MANY OF THE BUSINESSES WHEN

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:57.302
THEY HAD TO CLOSE- AND WHEN I

02:07:57.369 --> 02:08:01.507
GOT TIME TO RE OPEN. HOW DO

02:08:01.573 --> 02:08:02.307
LEVY OPEN SAFELY. SO WORKING

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:05.377
CLOSELY GUIDELINES FOR THEM- TO

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:06.712
SAFELY REOPEN IT ONE OF THOSE

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:08.881
INCLUDED OUTDOOR OPERATIONS

02:08:08.947 --> 02:08:09.882
THAN THAT CAME A LITTLE BIT

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:11.683
LATER ON. BUT THE EMERGENCY

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:13.652
BRAKES PACKAGE THEN CONSISTED

02:08:13.719 --> 02:08:15.621
OF LET ME LET ME BACK UP JUST

02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:17.189
ONE MORE MINUTE IN TERMS OF

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:18.257
THINGS THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF THE

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:20.759
REGULATIONS. SO WE DID- WORK

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:23.195
TO- EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN PLACE

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:24.163
THAT WOULD GIVE THEM SOME

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:26.231
RELIEF BY PUSHING BACK THE

02:08:26.298 --> 02:08:28.267
DATE. WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THEIR

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:29.968
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE DUE

02:08:30.035 --> 02:08:31.437
WITCHING BACKDATES WHEN THEIR

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:33.172
TABLE FEES WOULD BE DO SO WE

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:34.406
DIDN'T DO THAT A COUPLE OF

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:36.208
TIMES TO GIVE THEM SOME RELIEF.

02:08:36.275 --> 02:08:37.142
WHEN THEY HAD TO HAVE THE DOORS

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.344
CLOSE FULLY EMERGENCY RENTALS

02:08:39.411 --> 02:08:41.280
TO HELP THEM- SAFELY RE OPENED-

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.749
THEIR DOORS FOR BUSINESS. AND

02:08:43.816 --> 02:08:47.386
AROUND THAT CAME ONE WAS- TO

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:49.655
ALLOW THE COLOR OF MY ACCOUNT.

02:08:49.721 --> 02:08:50.923
SOME OF THESE CARTOONS ARE VERY

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:54.059
SMALL AND SO THE- NORMALLY YOU

02:08:54.126 --> 02:08:55.561
HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE IN

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:56.862
THE COUNT ROOM BECAUSE YOU NEED

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:57.896
TO HAVE THE WITNESSES AND WE

02:08:57.963 --> 02:08:58.997
HAVE TO. THE CHECKS AND

02:08:59.064 --> 02:09:01.967
BALANCES SOME OF THEM WERE- ARE

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:03.669
VERY SMALL AND THEIR PROBLEMS

02:09:03.735 --> 02:09:05.270
IS VERY SMALL SO THEY CAN

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:06.672
ACCOMMODATE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL

02:09:06.738 --> 02:09:07.773
DISTANCING RULES THAT COULD

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:09.208
ACCOMMODATE HAVING THAT NUMBER

02:09:09.274 --> 02:09:11.176
OF PEOPLE SET INTO THE ROAD. SO

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:13.045
WE WILL WE ALLOW THEM THE

02:09:13.112 --> 02:09:15.914
REGULATION WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

02:09:15.981 --> 02:09:17.950
HAVE REMOTE- HAVE SOMEONE

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:19.618
LOOKING REMOTELY TO DO THE

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:22.421
CHECKS AND BALANCES. SO THAT

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:26.091
WAS ONE OF THEM- THE OTHER. WAS

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:33.832
WITH. RESPECT TO- THERE ARE

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:35.200
THERE ARE TALK ABOUT THE FEES

02:09:35.267 --> 02:09:37.302
BUT WE RESPECT TO- IF YOU JUST

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:38.704
ALLOW ME ONE SECOND I KIND OF

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:49.915
ABSOLUTELY. ELSEWHERE. SO WE

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:52.050
ARE EVENTUALLY I HAD TO

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:54.052
LEGISLATION BOOK WORK WITH

02:09:54.119 --> 02:09:56.255
WHICH IS AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.423
AND THAT GAVE THEM RELEASED

02:09:58.490 --> 02:10:00.659
FROM- FROM FEES FOR TWO YEAR

02:10:00.726 --> 02:10:01.493
PERIOD OF TIME SO WE'RE HAPPY

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.495
THAT THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:04.730
INTO LAW AND THAT WOULD GIVE

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:07.499
THEM SOME SOME RELIEF AS WELL.

02:10:07.566 --> 02:10:11.470
SO I THINK THAT WHAT WE DID-

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:15.407
ALLOW THEM TO OPEN SAFELY- OPEN

02:10:15.474 --> 02:10:17.309
THE DOORS BACK FROM BUSINESS TO

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:18.911
AND- A LOT OF THE PUBLIC BACK

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:20.812
IN I WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:22.848
SANITATION PLAN HAVE THAT

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:25.884
SANITATION PLAN- HANDED IN TO

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:26.852
THE TO THE BUREAU INTO THE

02:10:26.919 --> 02:10:28.587
COMMISSION SO THAT THEY CAN BE

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:31.523
CHECKED- AND- THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:34.126
THEM TO SAFELY OPEN SO I THINK

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:35.961
IT WAS I THINK WHAT WE DID WAS

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:37.896
VERY HELPFUL FOR THEM AND GOING

02:10:37.963 --> 02:10:40.098

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:42.768
TO SEE- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SAY

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.536
BECAUSE- AS ERIC MENTIONED WITH

THIS DELTA VARIANT. I DON'T

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:46.505
KNOW THAT SOME F THESE

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:51.877

RIGHT. AND THE ARE. ADJUSTED SO

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.855
THAT. SOME OF THE IT ESPECIALLY

02:11:03.922 --> 02:11:05.657
SENATE PLANTS SO THAT THEY

02:11:05.724 --> 02:11:06.491
COULD LOOK TO THE LOCAL

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:08.961
JURISDICTIONS MAKE IT LOOK TO

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:12.331
THE- CDC AND OSHA GUIDELINES IN

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:14.266

TO DO THE SANITATION SO. SOME

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:20.839
OF THESE CONTINUE. CURRENTLY

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:22.608
THE WAY IT IS THEY BY OPERATION

02:11:22.674 --> 02:11:24.509
OF LAW THEY'RE GOING TO EXPIRE.

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:28.647
BUT WE VISIT AND SEE IF THERE'S

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:30.616
