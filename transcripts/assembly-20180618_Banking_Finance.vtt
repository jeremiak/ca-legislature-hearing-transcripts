00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:45.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SUPPOSED TO COLLECT SALES TAX ON

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:47.373 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
DISPENSARIES SO I ASKED HOW
MUCH.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO WE COLLECTED NOBODY KNEW THE

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
ANSWER.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL A PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:53.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SCHEDULE ONE NATURE BUT

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SECONDLY AB ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WAS THE LACK OF BACKING ACCESS.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT OR

00:06:58.684 --> 00:06:59.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH WE

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:00.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
COLLECTED.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:02.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OF THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WE

00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:04.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FIGURED WE COLLECTED ABOUT FORTY

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:06.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NINE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:07.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND I THINK THAT'S ONLY ABOUT

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
25% OF THE TAXES THAT ARE

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLY DO AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:12.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
WE CANNOT AUDIT.

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:15.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CASH SO WE NEED A PAPER TRAIL

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:17.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND NOT ONLY IS THIS BILL GOOD

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IT ALSO IS

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
GOING TO CREATE THAT PAPER

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRAILS THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THAT PEOPLE ARE PAYING.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:23.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEIR FAIR SHARE OF TAXES IN

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%

SUPPOSED TO BE THE CUTTING EDGE

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:39.438 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%

THE INTERNET ONLY RELATES TO

RIGHT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE THE

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

STOP PEOPLE FROM GETTING IN BUT

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ONCE THEY BREAK IN WE'VE SEEN

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT'S HAPPENED AT UCLA.

00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:53.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE STATE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE BLOCKCHAIN IS BY ITS NATURE

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:57.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT AND IN

ESSENCE EACH PIECE OF DATA
HOUSE.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
OUR UNIQUE NUMBER.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IT HAS A NUMBER THAT'S ATTACHED

TO THIS PIECE OF DATA A NUMBER

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S ATTACHED TO THIS SPEECH

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:08.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TODAY TO AND IT'S DATED IT'S

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IN

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ORDER TO GET FROM POINT A TO

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
POINT B..

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:14.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU HAVE TO TRACE EVERYTHING

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALONG THE LINE IT'S ALMOST

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:16.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IMPOSSIBLE TO BREAK THE CODE

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S WHITE STARTED WITH BIG

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:20.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POINT IF IF ANYBODY SAW RECENTLY

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S BEEN A SERIES OF ADS ON

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TELEVISION FOR A MAJOR COMPANY

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:25.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ADVERTISING BLOCKCHAIN. FOR

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:26.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

MAY BE.

00:12:30.749 --> 00:12:32.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS I

00:12:32.218 --> 00:12:33.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WANTED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO

00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
INTRODUCE THIS NOTION THE

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEGISLATURE I STARTED OUT WITH

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:37.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
THE CONCEPT.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF OF DOING NON TITLE A LAND

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TITLE I MET WITH THE PRIME

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THEY'RE DOING BUT WE COULDN'T DO

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT BECAUSE THE TITLE INSURANCE

00:12:48.134 --> 00:12:49.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
COMPANIES WILL.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS WANTED

STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS TOO

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPLICATED SO HOW CAN I STICK

S. AMBER SOME.

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I JUST JUST THE COMET I'M AND

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK LOOKING AT DIFFERENT

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:35.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TECHNOLOGIES IS IS IS GOOD AND

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IS INTERESTING.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:38.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:39.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT ULTIMATELY HAS TO GET OUT

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:40.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WITH HIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BLOCKCHAIN THE BLOCKCHAIN PUBLIC

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:42.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
KEY PRIVATE KEY.

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ENCRYPTION AT ITS AT ITS

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:45.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIMPLEST ME THAT'S REALLY.

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:46.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ULTIMATELY ALL THAT IT IS IN

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE SOME PROTECT BUT UNDER THE

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EXISTING BLOCKCHAIN BITCOIN FOR

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXAMPLE THAT'S BEEN USE IT HAS

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SOME VULNERABILITIES WHEN.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH OR WHEN YOU

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:57.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
USING IT?

00:17:58.377 --> 00:17:59.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:01.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ANOTHER CHAIN APPAREL CHAIN

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT'S CREATED SO IF YOU'RE

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:03.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
USING.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOUR SAMPLE SIZES ARE SMALL

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS POTENTIALLY NUMBER OF FOLKS

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN A CLOSELY HELD CORPORATION.

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:09.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
AND YOU USING THAT AS A

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:12.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MECHANISM TO TRACK THE THE STOCK

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND ANY STOCK TRANSACTIONS

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE JUST TRACKING THE STOCK.

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:17.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IRA Y. WOULD NEED YOU SOMETHING

00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:19.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
THIS COMPLICATED.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:19.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT IF WHAT YOU DO IS TRY TO

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:20.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
TRACK.

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
TRANSACTIONS THEN THAT'S

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:23.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SOMETHING THAT THAT THE

00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:25.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
BLOCKCHAIN CAN BE SOMETHING

00:18:25.871 --> 00:18:27.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR BUT IF YOU

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE A SMALL ENOUGH NUMBER OF

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:29.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
USERS IN THAT.

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEN YOU HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
OF HAVING A SECONDARY CHAIN

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:34.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S GREAT ADVICE BUT BY FOLKS

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT COME IN AND PARTICULARLY

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REPLICATE THAT DATA ESPECIALLY.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PRIOR TO THAT THAT THE NEXT

00:18:39.985 --> 00:18:41.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHATEVER THE NEXT BLOCK IS BEING

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
VERIFIED SO THEY CREATE A

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:45.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COMPETING BLOCK THAT THEN GETS

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:47.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
VERIFIED BEFORE YOUR EXISTS IN

00:18:47.159 --> 00:18:47.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS INTO THE EXISTING

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
TECHNOLOGY.

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:49.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEFORE YOUR CURRENT POCKETS TECH

00:18:49.761 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
GETS VERIFIED.

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THEN THE FRAUDULENT CHAIN NOW

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BECOMES THE PRIMARY CHAIN AND

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU'VE NOW ABSOLUTELY CORRUPTED

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE INTEGRITY

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
IN IN YOUR SYSTEM.

00:19:00.873 --> 00:19:02.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THINGS

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:03.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I THINK THAT THOSE WHO WERE

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:04.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOING THE RESEARCH AND REALLY

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
DIGGING INTO INTO BOXING

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:07.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
TECHNOLOGY.

00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT HAS SOME REALLY INTERESTING

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
POSSIBILITIES BUT ALSO HAS SOME

00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
VULNERABILITIES IN FOR MANY USES

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:13.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR SOMETHING INSIGNIFICANT

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
SECURITIES.

00:19:14.152 --> 00:19:16.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHICH I THINK IS VERY VIABLE WE

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:16.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PRODUCTS ARE THERE THAT THE

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.291 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE IN
PLACE.

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SITUATION THAT WE'RE CREATING A

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PHANTOM CHAIN THAT THEN.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OVER ESSENTIALLY OVERRIDES IN

00:19:27.065 --> 00:19:29.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND OVER VALIDATES THE THAT THE

00:19:29.134 --> 00:19:30.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
PRIMARY CHAIN RECORD THE

00:19:30.435 --> 00:19:32.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ORIGINAL CHANGE SO SETTING UP

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:33.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE POSSIBILITY HAS GOT TO BE

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE BUT WHAT I THINK WHEN THE

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PIECE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:36.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
NEED.

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IS THAT IS SOMETHING TO TO BE

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABLE TO VERIFY AND ENSURE THAT

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE IS IN FACT [inaudible]

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SECURITY.

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:45.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AROUND HOW THAT CHANGE DEVELOPS

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:47.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OVER TIME AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE HAVE THE VIABLE CHANGE

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND NOT THE PHANTOM CHAIN THAT

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:53.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GETS THEN BUILD AND TAKES OVER

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
KNOW THE AUTHORITY OF THAT THAT.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE CHAIN THAT IS THE THAT IS

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE THAT IS THE AUTHORIZED AND

00:19:58.463 --> 00:19:59.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:02.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BA YEAH GREAT INTERESTING BUT I

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:04.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I HAVEN'T SEEN IMPLEMENTATIONS

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:07.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YET THAT WE'RE QUITE THERE BUT

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:08.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AS FAR AS OPENING UP THE

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:11.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
POSSIBILITY AND SIMILAR CALDERON

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:12.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS A BILL TO ASK THE STATE TO

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:14.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOOK AT BLOCKING TECHNOLOGIES.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:16.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S I THINK A MECHANISM TO BE

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:18.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABLE TO BUILD IN THE SAFEGUARDS

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE HAVE A

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ROBUST AND THE THE PROTECTIONS

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:24.256 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
AROUND IT REGARDLESS OF THE
SIZE.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:27.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
OF THE USERS FEAR THAT THAT ARE

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
USING THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:20:29.494 --> 00:20:31.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOOD SO BUT I THINK THIS IS THIS

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:33.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
APPROPRIATE STEP AT THIS POINT.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:34.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THANK YOU SOME NUMBERS SHOWN A

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:39.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SOMBER JUDGE I THANK YOU IDEA --

00:20:39.738 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WOULD BE SUPPORTING NOT DISARM

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:44.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SADDAM NOT MY UNDERSTANDING --

00:20:44.242 --> 00:20:45.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
USING --

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO A

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:49.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
RECORD -- OR

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE TRANSACTION A INFORMATION

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NAMES IN --

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:56.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHATEVER ELMONT CYCAS.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.925 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SO A
NEW.

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:02.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AUTHORIZATION USING THE PLOT

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
CHAIN VERSUS ARE.

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:06.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ALREADY ARE.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MY OWNERSHIP OF A CERTAIN STOCK

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
IS ALREADY.

00:21:10.202 --> 00:21:13.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
UP CAPTURE THE IN.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
BY THE BE SURE.

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HA HA MANY SHARES HIGH HAVE.

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:18.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE US NUMBER ONE QUESTION

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:20.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
NUMBER -- TO

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:22.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUESTION AND JUST TO FINISH UP

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:25.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
IS THAT THE ARE.

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IT IS SAID THE BLOCKCHAIN

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TECHNOLOGIES SAME AS SOMETHING I

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
HEARD THAT BITCOIN.

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:34.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
THAT I CAN USE.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OBVIOUSLY I I I I CAN I CAN CASH

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:39.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
OUT THE MY YOU KNOW THE STOCK

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:42.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WORDINGS AND THAT THAT IS A CASH

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:42.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
[inaudible]

00:21:42.534 --> 00:21:46.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
BUT THE IT IS OF VERY

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CONTROVERSIAL --

00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:50.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT THAT THE BITCOIN NATURE

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:51.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT THE WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
WITH THIS I MAY BE.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIS OUR TECHNICIANS SECOND CAN

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:57.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
EXPLAIN FOR THE THE

00:21:57.582 --> 00:22:00.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
DISTINGUISHING --

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THIS SO IT

00:22:02.754 --> 00:22:04.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
QUEENS AND THE BLACK CHAIN.

00:22:04.189 --> 00:22:05.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
OF RECORDING.

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:07.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAH FIRST OF ALL THE THE IDEA

00:22:07.726 --> 00:22:09.461 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
OF THE LEDGER THE WRITTEN
LEDGER.

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:11.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ENGAGED IN THIS SERIES OF

00:22:12.597 --> 00:22:13.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LEGISLATION TODAY IT SEEMS LIKE

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:15.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IT'S OLD STUFF.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BUT WE HAD PROBLEMS OF ALL HAVE

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BEEN ONLY WHAT SIGNATURES COULD

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
USE A FAX TRANSMISSION COULD YOU

00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:22.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
USE DOCUSIGN.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:24.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
HAVE DEALT WITH OVER THE LAST

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:26.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY YEARS IS TRYING TO UPDATE

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
THE LAW.

00:22:27.345 --> 00:22:29.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AS TO FINDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND DEFINED IN THE LAW AND SO

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:33.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THIS DOES THAT NUMBER.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE TWO I THINK IT HELPS PRESENT

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROTECT AGAINST FRAUD BECAUSE

00:22:36.321 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH YOU WANT TO USE IT YOU NEED

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO PUT YOUR ARTICLES OF

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:39.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
INCORPORATION.

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:41.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IF SOMEBODY WERE TO GO TO A BANK

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:43.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY WOULD THEN ASK THE QUESTION

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:45.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A OF OF OF WHERE THE LEDGER WAS

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:46.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IT'S A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:47.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IT.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO IT'S IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WERE WERE MODERNIZING THE LAW

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AND HAVING INCREMENTAL CHANGE

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:53.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WITH RESPECT TO SOME LEVEL OF

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
SECURITY.

00:22:54.806 --> 00:22:56.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE IDEA BLOCKCHAIN IS JUST

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
SIMPLY ONE OF THE MECHANISMS BY

00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:01.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WHICH YOU BUILD ON BUT SHE'S

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:02.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
MADE --

00:23:02.714 --> 00:23:04.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BITCOIN IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MANY A WASTE TO UTILIZE THE

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BLOCKCHAIN THE BLOCKCHAIN IS THE

00:23:08.286 --> 00:23:09.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FOUNDATION ALMOST LIKE THE

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTERNET AND AN ARM THAT IS USED

00:23:12.257 --> 00:23:13.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FOR DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT BECAME HAD NOTORIETY AND IT'S

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUT SET BECAUSE THE BLOCKCHAIN

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:18.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS REALLY THE PLACE WHERE SHE

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
IS ME BITCOIN WAS THE PLACE

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:21.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
WHERE WE FIRST STARTED.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YET SO IT'S USUALLY NO NEXUS

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:25.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BETWEEN THE TWO EXCEPT FOR THE

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:26.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BIT COINS BE USING THE

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BLOCKCHAIN HERE WE'RE NOT AS IS

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:29.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
NO CONNECTION AND WHAT WE'RE

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:32.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOING THAT POINT AT ALL YOU WILL

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THROUGH BUT POINT AS A RESULT OF

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THIS.

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:36.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
OKAY.

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:37.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THINK.

00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:37.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
COMMENTS.

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALRIGHT THIS BILL DOES HAVE A DO

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:42.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PASSED TO ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE.
