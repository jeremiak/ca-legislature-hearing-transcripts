SERVICES COMMITTEE TODAY WE HAVE NINE BILLS ON THE AGENDA WITH FIVE BILLS ON CONSENT. AS A REMINDER WE LIMIT TESTIMONY TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. EACH WITNESS HAS TWO MINUTES TO TESTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WE ALSO TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION WE'RE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE. WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT I DO SEE AN AUTHOR MY FAVORITE SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA COME ON UP. ON ITEM NUMBER NINE SB. SEVEN THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON. AND HAPPY TO BE HERE AN EXCITED THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ACTUALLY PRESENTING ON THIS BILL. SB SEVEN THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE TO SPECIFIC ELEMENTS. THAT APPLICATION AND REDO TERMINATION FORMS FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDE A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE APPLICANT NEEDS ACCOMMODATIONS. DUE TO A DISTURBED DISABILITY OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXPERIENCE ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS ALREADY TOLD THE CASE WORKER THAT THEY NEED ACCOMMODATIONS THE FIRST PAGE OF THEIR CASE FILE WILL ALERT. ANY OTHER CASE WORKER THAT THE APPLICANTS NEED THE NECESSARY ACCOMMODATIONS CURRENTLY COUNTY SHOES THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM SAWS TO MANAGE ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY FOR CAL FIRST CAL WORKS MEDI CAL AND GENERAL ASSISTANCE AMONG OTHER THINGS. UNFORTUNATELY. SOME FORMS FOR THESE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS DO NOT ASK ABOUT THE APPLICANTS NEED FOR DISABILITY OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACCOMMODATIONS. SO THOSE APPLICANTS MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT CERTAIN ACCOMMODATIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM. WHEN TRYING TO ACCESS MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES AND SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? RECEIVED ACCOMMODATIONS THEY NEED WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSTANTLY DISCLOSE OUR SITUATION. IN ADDITION LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB EIGHTEEN ELEVEN WHICH MEANS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME SSI RECIPIENTS. WERE SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER OR PEOPLE OF ANY AGE WHO ARE BLIND DISABLE OR DISABLED WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE CAL FRESH BENEFITS. THIS CHANGE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE AN INFLUX OF NEW APPLICANTS AND RECIPIENTS WHO MADE NEED ACCOMMODATIONS. GIVEN THE ALREADY HIGH CASELOAD FOR WORKERS. SB SEVEN THIRTY FIVE ENSURES THAT A PRACTICAL AND EFFECTIVE PROCESS IS IN PLACE TO IDENTIFY BENEFICIARIES WHO MAY NEED ACCOMMODATIONS TO DO THEIR DISABILITY OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EXPERIENCE. TODAY WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT IS KEVIN AS ALONG FROM THE CAL COALITION OF WHERE FOR RIGHTS ASSOCIATION ORG ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION EXCUSE ME.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DESK ABOUT LOW THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ARE A SPONSOR IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- THAT CURRENTLY EBT CANNOT BE USED ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER STE -- PAYMENT CANNOT BE USED ONLINE AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL PIN CODE -- AND AND IT'S TO PROTECT THE CONSUMER -- FROM HAVING THEIR BENEFITS STOLEN -- THE PROPOSED. AS PILOTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES ALLOW SOMEBODY TO PURCHASE THINGS ONLINE BUT WE FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS FOR CALIFORNIA FIGURE OUT -- WITH REGARDS TO CASH BENEFITS AND HOW THEY'LL BE USED ONLINE -- MAKING SURE THAT THE FOOD PURCHASED THROUGH -- ONLINE PURCHASES IS IS SAFE AND HEALTHY -- AND THAT. THE DELIVERY FEES ARE EXORBITANT OR OR OR MORE COSTLY FOR THE POOR A COMMUNITIES -- AND SO THIS BILL BASICALLY ESTABLISHES -- DIRECTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO ESTABLISH -- A CONVERSATION A TABLE WHERE WE CAN ALL COME TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE. THAT KIND OF NEW ABILITY TO PURCHASE ONLINE LOOKS LIKE AND HOW WE BEST PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS THIS STATE AND THIS BODY THE LEGISLATURE HAVE LED THE WAY IN AB T..

THIS MEASURES DESIGNED TO HELP HARD WORKING INDIVIDUALS KEEP THEIR JOBS AND THEIR EDUCATIONAL ALL OPPORTUNITIES ALTHOUGH MANY WORKING PARENTS ARE ELIGIBLE AND EVENTUALLY APPROVED FOR CAL WORKS CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE. SOMETIMES IT'S TOO LATE AND THIS LACK OF CHILDCARE RESULTS IN JOB LOSS. OF TODAY WE HAVE UP HERE AS WITNESSES KEVIN OF LANI IN AND JUST AGO BIRTH FOLLOW. THE KEVIN AS THE COALITION CALIFORNIA WHAT RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS THE REASON WE WORKING ON THIS BILL IS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD. A SEVERAL FAMILIES THAT CAME INTO OFFICE. BECAUSE COMPLAINING THAT THEY HAD A JOB THEY NEED A CHILD CARE THEY COULDN'T GET THE CHAKA THE TOOK THIRTY DAYS THAT OFF THE JOB WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE BILL WE ORIGINAL VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DISCOVERED LOWER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ALSO A SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND AND AGREE WE'VE HEARD FROM CLIENTS WHO HAD THIS VERY SITUATION AND THEY END UP STAYING ON A LONGER -- WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEIR KIDS ARE ARE LESS WELL OFF AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY I'M NOT ONLY GOOD POLICY BUT ALSO A GOOD INVESTMENT? SAID THANK YOU AND WE ARE DRIVE BELT. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE COME FORWARD STATE YOUR NAME. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. WE CAN SEE CHRISTIAN SENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. HEARING IS SAYING NONE BUT BRING IT BACK TO THE BODY. MR CHOI. DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY SENATOR -- I I HAVE GREASY MOST OF FROM A MORE TRUSTING -- YOU ARE. REQUIRING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THE A CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE 100% COUNTY SO WOULD PROVIDE THE THE CASH ALLOWANCE SO OR HOW HOW DO THEY HELP WITH THAT THE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND HOW LONG. IN A HOME WITH THAT THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE REIMBURSED -- TO COUNTIES HELP FROM THE STATE THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS OKAY JUST REAL QUICK AND THEN YOU CAN REALLY FEEL IT AND BUT THIS IS -- BASICALLY TO JUST -- ESTABLISH THE ELIGIBILITY QUICKER RATHER THAN WAIT THE THIRTY DAYS THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT WERE ASKING FOR BECAUSE THEY END UP BEING ELIGIBLE. BUT GETS DONE SO SLOW THIRTY DAYS LATER THAT THEY'VE ALREADY LOST THE UP EITHER LOST THEIR JOB OR THEY LOST IT BUT PARTICIPATING THE TRAINING PROGRAM SO IT'S TO SPEED UP WHAT WOULD BE ELIGIBILITY ANYWAY. BUT TO DO IT SOONER IF YOU KNOW YOU'LL BE YOU'LL BE IN REQUIRE SUCH A MEDIA -- CHILD CARE SERVICES SO SO THAT MEANS UP BRING IT UP. SOONER RIGHT AND THAT THAT THE LENGTH THAT WILL BE EXTENDED TO MY THINKING. IF THAT'S THE CASE THERE ARE BE ADDITIONAL COST. TO THE COUNTY WHETHER THAT -- COST WOULD BE REIMBURSED BY THE STATE. HOW LONG WILL THAT PERIOD TO BE? WITH THIS WILL COST BECAUSE THE TRAILER BILL RIGHT NOW PROVIDES THERE'S A NEW TRAILER BILL THE BUDGET PASSED. IN A PROVIDES THAT YOU GET STAGE. ONE FROM THE MINUTE THAT YOU NEED CHAO KILLA YOU CAN STAGE ONE FOR ONE WHOLE YEAR. AND THAT'S ALL PAID FOR SO THERE WILL BE NO COUNTY COSTS. FOR CLARIFICATION ACTUALLY WITHIN THE BUDGET BILLS THAT WE VOTED ON THERE'S FUNDING THERE SO THE STATE WOULD BE PAYING FOR THE COST -- ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS OCCURRED WITH THE CENTER I THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL I'D LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. AND THIS IS NOT EXTENDING WHAT OR ALREADY THE RULES IT'S JUST BILL. OF FAST FORWARDING THE ELIGIBILITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANKS OF THAT THIS IS GOOD I'VE SEEN THIS IN MY DISTRICT -- AND EVEN DURING MY TIME DURING COLLEGE. AND SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE ABILITY. TO AFTER SCHOOL BE ABLE TO GET THAT JOB AND THEN HAVE CHILDREN -- AND AND BALANCE THE HOLY ENTIRE THING YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE THAT DAY CARE. RIGHT AWAY FOR SAYS HAVING TO BE ON A WAIT LIST IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL AND GETS THESE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN NEED WORKING SOONER RIGHT -- AND CONTRIBUTING IN THEIR TAX DOLLARS BACK TO THE STATE TO PAY FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THIS THANK YOU THANK -- CURRENTLY WE DO NOT HAVE A MOTION.

LEAVE YOUR NEXT BILL IS SENATE BILL THREE NINETY EIGHT THIS ALSO AS A SUPPORT SUPPORT SECOND. THANK YOU WELL -- I COULD JUST SAY VERY QUICKLY -- MEMBERS -- THE NINETY EIGHT SB THREE NINETY EIGHT UPDATES THE STATE LAW REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY. TO REFLECT RECENT UPDATES TO FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY. AGENCIES -- I WOULD JUST. LET ME INTRODUCE OUR WITNESSES KERR CHILD OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND THEN THEY ARE RIVERA OF CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. SIX A BUTCHER CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW WE ARE THE PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE LARGEST -- SUCH ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION -- ARE -- THIRTY DERIVES -- IN LARGE PART FROM FEDERAL LAW AND WE HAVE WITHIN THAT -- FEDERAL LAW THREE SEPARATE -- PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT -- GIVE US AUTHORITY -- TO BASICALLY -- ENTER INTO IN THE FACILITY AND GET RECORDS IN THOSE FACILITIES WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PERSON WITH A DISABILITY THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO ABUSE OR NEGLECT WE HAVE HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA CODIFIED -- THOSE FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN AND IN STATE LAWS SO THIS BILL DOES -- JUST THAT WITH THE LAST SET OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED IN. TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SO THIS CONFORMS -- WITH -- WITH FEDERAL LAW AND IT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE WE THINK THE NECESSARY TRANSPARENCY IN STATE LAW -- SO THAT WE CAN AVOID ANY DISPUTES ON THOSE VISITS TO FACILITIES THAT WE ULTIMATELY -- NEED TO VISIT THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT CLARIFIES THAT A FACILITY OR PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES -- THOSE FACILITIES USED TO HOUSE -- OR DETAIN INDIVIDUALS AND AND IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS -- SO THIS -- CLARIFIES THAT WE HAVE THAT AUTHORITY AS WELL AND WE'VE BEEN USING THAT WITH A LITTLE MORE -- REGULARITY -- AS WE'VE MADE SOME VISITS INTO FOR EXAMPLE ADELANTO AND PRODUCED A REPORT FROM THERE BUT ALSO IN THE YOUTH FACILITIES OPERATED BY OR ON OUR WE ARE CHAIR I VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS ANDREA RIVERA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB -- THREE NINETY EIGHT AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DETAINED AND IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS AND SUFFER FROM A MENTAL IMPAIRMENT OR ILLNESS ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE -- THE SERVICES THAT THEY REQUIRE NOT ONLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BUT LEGAL SERVICES AS WELL. BY EXPANDING THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF A FACILITY -- PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA'S ADVOCACY AGENCY LAWS WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL GAIN ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY REQUIRE. IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB ONE OH THREE WHICH DIRECTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MONITOR AND PRODUCE REPORTS ON THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE FOUND IN IMMIGRANT DETENTION FACILITIES AND OUR STATE -- THE AG'S OFFICE ISSUED THEIR FIRST REPORT AND FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR AND THEY FOUND THAT DETAINEES HAVE -- MULTIPLE BARRIERS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FEDERAL OFFICIALS ALSO REPORT THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS -- WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESSES AND ARE IN THESE FACILITIES DO NOT GET THE ACCESS THAT THEY DESERVE? ALSO -- I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT STATE -- SUICIDE AND YOU KNOW OTHER. ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO MENTAL ILLNESS ARE AT AN ALL TIME HIGH AND AGAIN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING -- THE AXIS THAT THEY NEED TO SERVICES -- ONE OF THESE CASES ACTUALLY RESULT IN WHAT IS NOW KNOWN AS THE FRANCO ROLLING -- SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS CASE THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL MISTER JOSE ANTONIO FRANKEL GONZALEZ -- HE WAS DETAINED -- FOR FIVE YEARS WITH NO HEARING OR A LAWYER IN THIS FAMILY WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE HIM DURING THAT TIME. AND SO ALTHOUGH -- THAT CASE DID RESULT IN SOME PROTECTIONS -- CALIFORNIA'S STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO IN ORDER -- TO TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE REQUEST THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT SB. THREE NINETY EIGHT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. ALL RIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.
