00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.058 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WAS THAT.

00:32:38.824 --> 00:32:42.360 region:rollup2
.

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:45.096 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SERVING LOW

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.766 region:rollup2
RISK NOBLE LOW RISK LOW NEED.

00:32:45.096 --> 00:32:48.033 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN

00:32:51.636 --> 00:32:53.872 region:rollup2
AT THE RELEASE YA

00:32:52.771 --> 00:32:55.841 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS

00:32:53.872 --> 00:32:57.275 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND WE RELEASED A

00:32:55.841 --> 00:32:58.443 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:32:57.275 --> 00:33:01.213 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN JULY AND

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:03.048 region:rollup2
DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FROM

00:33:01.213 --> 00:33:04.716 region:rollup2
THE UP THE CAMP PROGRAM.

00:33:03.048 --> 00:33:06.651 region:rollup2
FORTY PART FORTY TWO PERCENT UP

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:08.954 region:rollup2
POPULATION WAS HIGH RISK.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:10.422 region:rollup2
IF YOU ADD IN THE MODERATE RISK

00:33:08.954 --> 00:33:11.923 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT

00:33:10.422 --> 00:33:13.492 region:rollup2
OF WHO ARE EITHER MODERATE TO

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:15.894 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK.

00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:17.863 region:rollup2
TO RE OFFEND.

00:33:15.894 --> 00:33:20.065 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY.

00:33:17.863 --> 00:33:21.633 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN ONLY THIRTEEN PERCENT

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:23.602 region:rollup2
OF THE POPULATION HAD EITHER A

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:25.570 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED.

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:27.005 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT TIME ABOUT WHEN

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.507 region:rollup2
WE LOOK AT THIS POPULATION IT

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:30.141 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY POPULATION THAT HAS.

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:32.878 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:36.548 region:rollup2
F. FAIRLY HIGH.

00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:38.183 region:rollup2
NEED FOR STABLE HOUSING FOR

LACKEY NAT THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE

00:33:39.985 --> 00:33:43.522 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOM. WOULD BE RIGHT UP

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:45.023 region:rollup2
THERE WITHOUT WITH OUR GENERAL

00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:47.792 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:50.028 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SORT OF.

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:51.162 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK WE'VE GOT IS THAT THIS

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.563 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUT AN EVIDENCE BASED

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.164 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:33:51.563 --> 00:33:55.133 region:rollup2
WILL THERE ISN'T ANOTHER

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:56.768 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LIKE IT'S FOR US TO SAY

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.969 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN

REPLICATED ELSEWHERE.

00:33:57.969 --> 00:34:01.673 region:rollup2
MOST PROGRAMS DON'T START OUT

00:34:00.038 --> 00:34:03.308 region:rollup2
AS EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS BOMB

00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:05.343 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:06.845 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE DO THE CONTRACT FOR

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:08.146 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDER.

00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:09.347 region:rollup2
THEY WILL USED EVIDENCE THEY

OPPORTUNITIES AND GETTING

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:24.930 region:rollup2
PAROLEES ARE EMPLOYED. REDUCES

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:25.530 region:rollup2
THE RISK TO OFFEND WHICH IS

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.265 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY AN EVIDENCE BASED

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:30.335 region:rollup2

PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S

00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:26.424 region:rollup2
UNLIKELY TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AT

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:30.528 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS CITED AS ITS

00:35:27.826 --> 00:35:31.596 region:rollup2
PRIMARY GOAL. FOR THE PROPOSAL.

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:33.198 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:34.1000 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE FOR THREE REASONS

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:36.801 region:rollup2
FIRST IT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASE

00:35:34.1000 --> 00:35:38.103 region:rollup2
THAT IS THERE WERE NOT AWARE OF

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.337 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:41.306 region:rollup2
FOUND FOUND TO BE WRITTEN

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:43.475 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. I'M AT REDUCING

00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:46.444 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM AND THERE'S ALSO NO

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:48.947 region:rollup2
PLAN TO FOR A. REBUT INDEPENDENT

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:51.149 region:rollup2
OR RIGOROUS ENOUGH EVALUATION TO

00:35:48.947 --> 00:35:51.683 region:rollup2
ASSESS WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:53.251 region:rollup2
INDEED EFFECTIVE ONCE IT'S

00:35:51.683 --> 00:35:54.786 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:56.254 region:rollup2
SECOND IT'S TARGETED I PAROLEES

00:35:54.786 --> 00:35:58.523 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE WHO APPEAR TO BE.

00:35:56.254 --> 00:36:02.160 region:rollup2
AMONG THE LEAST LIKELY TO NEED

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:03.495 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN CDC ARE A. AND THIS

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.529 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.864 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO RECRUIT PRIMARILY

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:06.865 region:rollup2
INMATE FIREFIGHTERS AS YOU'VE

00:36:05.864 --> 00:36:08.666 region:rollup2
HEARD.

00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:09.968 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A POPULATION THAT IS

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:11.236 region:rollup2
BELIEVED GENERALLY TO BE OF LOW

00:36:09.968 --> 00:36:13.038 region:rollup2
RISK TO THE COMMUNITY AND HAS

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:14.072 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS AND

00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:15.640 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO WORK.

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:17.509 region:rollup2
I THROUGH THE FIRE THEIR

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.743 region:rollup2
ASSIGNMENT TO THE FIRE CAMP HOW

00:36:17.509 --> 00:36:20.345 region:rollup2
AND YOU HEARD SOME STATISTICS

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:21.680 region:rollup2
JUST NOW I AM I THINK THE KEY

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:23.081 region:rollup2
THING TO NOTE IS.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.916 region:rollup2
HOW THEY COMPARE HOW THE?

00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:26.618 region:rollup2
FIRE CAMP POPULATION WOULD

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.887 region:rollup2
COMPARE TO THEM E. THE REMAINDER

00:36:26.618 --> 00:36:30.455 region:rollup2
OF THE PAROLEES AS FAR AS THEIR

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:31.790 region:rollup2
THEIR RISK IN NEEDS.

00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:33.658 region:rollup2
.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.759 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AN ADDITIONALLY IT'S

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:37.262 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:39.731 region:rollup2
PROVIDED AT PLAN AS TO HOW THEY

00:36:37.262 --> 00:36:40.899 region:rollup2
WOULD TARGET. BUT I AM.

00:36:39.731 --> 00:36:42.067 region:rollup2
INDETERMINATE BEAST OF THE

00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:43.134 region:rollup2
PROPOSED SERVICES TOWARD

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:45.136 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.337 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED NEED NOT JUST RISK OF

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:48.039 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM BUT NEED FOR

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:49.507 region:rollup2
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:51.376 region:rollup2
OR HOUSING ETCETERA THAT THE

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:52.143 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WOULD. POTENTIALLY

00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.511 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:54.579 region:rollup2
IN OTHER WORDS THE

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:56.181 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IT APPEARS IS

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:58.049 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO TARGET THE PROGRAM

00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:59.718 region:rollup2
TO PAROLEES WHO LIKELY HAVE LESS

00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:02.220 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SO TO SPEAK

00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:03.621 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO. THE GENERAL PEARLY

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.323 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:07.125 region:rollup2
OR TO OTHER POTENTIALLY MORE

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:09.060 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK PAROLEES OUT THERE.

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:10.595 region:rollup2
AND THIRD IT APPEARS UNLIKELY TO

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.563 region:rollup2
LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT AND THE

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:13.098 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HASN'T DONE THE

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:14.566 region:rollup2
LABOR MARKET ANALYSIS.

00:37:13.098 --> 00:37:16.134 region:rollup2
FOR POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE

00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:18.770 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR GRAD.

00:37:16.134 --> 00:37:19.738 region:rollup2
GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM. AND

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.839 region:rollup2
IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH AN

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:22.407 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES WE'VE TURNED TO

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:24.943 region:rollup2
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE WHICH SUGGEST

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:25.543 region:rollup2
THAT THE MARKET FOR FIREFIGHTERS

00:37:24.943 --> 00:37:26.511 region:rollup2
IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND THAT

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:28.680 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL

00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:30.482 region:rollup2
BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. FOR

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.716 region:rollup2
THOSE WITH FELONY RECORDS.

00:37:30.482 --> 00:37:32.851 region:rollup2
MOVING ON WE THINK THAT THE

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:35.153 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE

00:37:32.851 --> 00:37:36.888 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO OTHER RECIDIVISM

00:37:35.153 --> 00:37:39.023 region:rollup2
REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS.

00:37:36.888 --> 00:37:40.758 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE SAME ANNUAL

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:41.826 region:rollup2
COST OF THE PROGRAM CCR COULD

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:43.695 region:rollup2
INSTEAD PROVIDE COGNITIVE

00:37:41.826 --> 00:37:44.762 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WHICH IS AN

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:47.265 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION THAT'S BEEN FOUND

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:48.767 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM.

00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:50.335 region:rollup2
TO OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND INMATES

00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:51.769 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY.

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:53.338 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:55.673 region:rollup2
PROPOSED LARGE UP FRONT CAPITAL

00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:57.275 region:rollup2
OUTLAY INVESTMENT FOR A PROGRAM

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:58.543 region:rollup2
THAT APPEARS TO BE UNLIKELY TO

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:00.578 region:rollup2
BE EFFECTIVE AND HAS NOT BEEN

00:37:58.543 --> 00:38:02.080 region:rollup2
TESTED VIA PILOT.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.648 region:rollup2
I HAVE FURTHER MORE IT'S UNCLEAR

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.617 region:rollup2
WHETHER ALL OF THE REQUESTED

00:38:03.648 --> 00:38:07.118 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED GIVEN

00:38:05.617 --> 00:38:08.887 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:10.522 region:rollup2
PROVIDED FIRM PLANS ON SEVERAL

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:11.756 region:rollup2
OF THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL.

00:38:10.522 --> 00:38:13.424 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THERE

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:14.526 region:rollup2
ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:16.628 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY NINE PEARL E.

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:18.062 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS THAT

00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:19.564 region:rollup2
DON'T REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.899 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM.

00:38:19.564 --> 00:38:21.933 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING AND TO

00:38:20.899 --> 00:38:23.968 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:25.737 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN. REDUCING

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:27.138 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM I COULD REDIRECT SOME

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:29.707 region:rollup2
OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:30.141 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO. SUPPORT EVIDENCE

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:33.678 region:rollup2
BASED REHABILITATIVE

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:34.279 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING.

00:38:33.678 --> 00:38:37.582 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:41.352 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

00:38:37.582 --> 00:38:42.287 region:rollup2
YEAH LISTA JONES SAWYER I'M.

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:43.922 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MOSTLY A PROGRAM AFTER

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:45.857 region:rollup2
IN A.

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:48.426 region:rollup2
HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT.

00:38:45.857 --> 00:38:50.328 region:rollup2
DECADE ON WITH PROP 47-57

00:38:48.426 --> 00:38:52.363 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WILL BE NEW.

00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:54.532 region:rollup2
AN UNTESTED NAM AND HOPING THAT

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:54.799 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE NEW. AND UNTESTED

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:57.669 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:58.169 region:rollup2
THAT'S TWO WAY WE NEED TO GO

00:38:57.669 --> 00:38:59.070 region:rollup2
BUT THE OTHER THING IS.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:39:01.940 region:rollup2
.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:04.008 region:rollup2
THE CONSERVATION CORPS WHEN I

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.210 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH STEVE LOS ANGELES I

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:07.045 region:rollup2
WAS THE LANDLORD WHEN THEY WERE

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.112 region:rollup2
ON THEIR STILL ARE A MAIN STREET

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:10.648 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THE WORK THAT THEY'VE

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.516 region:rollup2
DONE. AND YOU PROBABLY GET SOME

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.550 region:rollup2
DATA.

00:39:11.516 --> 00:39:14.185 region:rollup2
FROM THE CONVERSATION COR THEIR

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.787 region:rollup2
SUCCESS.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:17.088 region:rollup2
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IN MY

00:39:15.787 --> 00:39:19.057 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND CLEAN UP

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:19.757 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS ALLEYS AND THINGS

00:39:19.057 --> 00:39:22.627 region:rollup2
THAT NATURE.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:23.728 region:rollup2
.

00:39:22.627 --> 00:39:25.396 region:rollup2
MY COUSIN WAS IN A CONSERVATION

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:27.098 region:rollup2
CORPS.

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:27.899 region:rollup2
AND JUST RECENTLY RETIRED FROM

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.800 region:rollup2
THE C. LOS ANGELES POLICE

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:30.568 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.670 region:rollup2
AS TOM.

00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:33.972 region:rollup2
NINE ONE ONE OPERATOR.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:36.274 region:rollup2
AND SHE WOULD TELL YOU WHO WON

00:39:33.972 --> 00:39:38.076 region:rollup2
FOR CONSERVATION CORPS. OF.

00:39:36.274 --> 00:39:38.943 region:rollup2
DIRECTING HER IN A MORE POSITIVE

00:39:38.076 --> 00:39:41.579 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:43.281 region:rollup2
SHE WOULD HAVE SPENT THE LAST.

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:44.716 region:rollup2
OF THIRTY SIX YEARS OF HER LIFE

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:46.651 region:rollup2
NAM.

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.952 region:rollup2
WORKING FOUR LAPD AND MOST

00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:50.655 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE WAY.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:52.624 region:rollup2
AND SO I.

00:39:50.655 --> 00:39:54.158 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE IN IT I'VE HAD

00:39:52.624 --> 00:39:55.760 region:rollup2
SEVERAL BILLS THAT WILL ATTEST

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:57.362 region:rollup2
TO IT.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.963 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR

00:39:57.362 --> 00:40:00.164 region:rollup2
AND FINANCE EVERYBODY'S APPS

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:01.566 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT WE DO NEED TO SET

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:03.134 region:rollup2
UP SOME MEASURES.

00:40:01.566 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
SIR WE CAN TELL WHETHER NOT THE

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:08.573 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS WORKING. AND I WOULD

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:10.308 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE NAM HELLFIRE LA WITH

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:12.076 region:rollup2
THEM CONSERVATION CORPS TO

00:40:10.308 --> 00:40:13.344 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THOSE METRICS

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:15.213 region:rollup2
IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. ON

00:40:13.344 --> 00:40:16.247 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY.

00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:17.448 region:rollup2
TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT ESPECIALLY

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:19.918 region:rollup2
TO ME.

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:21.686 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE RISK

00:40:19.918 --> 00:40:23.354 region:rollup2
RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:24.722 region:rollup2
BEEN TTC OUR AND OTHERS AND WE

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:27.759 region:rollup2
START MEASURING.

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:29.827 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL THAT.

00:40:27.759 --> 00:40:30.762 region:rollup2
ON EXCITE WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:32.297 region:rollup2
A LOT OF FUN AND. ALSO BELIEVE

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:35.199 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO PROBABLY GIVE EXTRA

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:36.501 region:rollup2
MONEY SO WE HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:38.269 region:rollup2
TO DO THE AUDITS BOGAN DO.

00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:40.571 region:rollup2
SOME ON TIME IN REAL TIME.

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:42.040 region:rollup2
.

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.640 region:rollup2
EVALUATION SEEK TO MAKE

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.641 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS AS YOU GO ALONG.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.877 region:rollup2
.

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.578 region:rollup2
SO I I.

00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:49.480 region:rollup2
I HOPE WE JUST DON'T ABANDON

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:52.617 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA BECAUSE.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.185 region:rollup2
OF I DO BELIEVE THAT THE SKILL

00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:55.653 region:rollup2
SET THAT YOU GET. IN THIS TYPE

00:40:54.185 --> 00:40:57.956 region:rollup2
OF TRAINING.

00:40:55.653 --> 00:41:00.658 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY COULD LEAD YOU INTO.

00:40:57.956 --> 00:41:01.292 region:rollup2
BECOME A FIREFIGHTER BUT

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:04.529 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS SKILL SET TO LEAD YOU

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:07.432 region:rollup2
TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS NOT JUST.

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:10.168 region:rollup2
I'M GOING INTO FIREFIGHTING OF.

00:41:07.432 --> 00:41:12.337 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE THE OLD CONCEPT OF.

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:13.671 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO GET UP ON TIME

00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:15.573 region:rollup2
SHOW UP TO WORK ON TIME

00:41:13.671 --> 00:41:18.009 region:rollup2
SHINE YOUR SHOES.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:19.177 region:rollup2
GET DRESSED PUT UNIFORM ON SHOW

00:41:18.009 --> 00:41:20.511 region:rollup2
UP BE POLITE.

00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:22.480 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:24.816 region:rollup2
TAKE CONSTRUCTION.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.085 region:rollup2
THAT IS JUST AS VALUABLE.

00:41:24.816 --> 00:41:28.786 region:rollup2
AS ANYTHING ELSE AND I'VE SEEN

00:41:27.085 --> 00:41:29.988 region:rollup2
IT WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:31.756 region:rollup2
MISSILES LIKE THAT WOULD BE THE

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:33.458 region:rollup2
CORE OF THIS PROGRAM.

00:41:31.756 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF

00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:37.128 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY'RE LOW RISK HIGH

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.363 region:rollup2
RISK THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED.

00:41:37.128 --> 00:41:39.931 region:rollup2
THEY NEED THAT KIND OF A

00:41:38.363 --> 00:41:41.632 region:rollup2
TRAINING TO MAKE THEM A MORE

00:41:39.931 --> 00:41:44.335 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS SO I.

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:45.737 region:rollup2
I HOPE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY.

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:47.705 region:rollup2
A GROUP OF FINANCE AND HOPEFULLY

00:41:45.737 --> 00:41:49.474 region:rollup2
THAT WE. MOVE FORWARD TO COME

00:41:47.705 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:52.543 region:rollup2
PUT IN THOSE MATRIX THAT I THINK

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:53.911 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY VERY THAT IT'S

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:55.780 region:rollup2
VALID.

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:56.814 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO TO HAVE

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:58.716 region:rollup2
THOSE BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END

00:41:56.814 --> 00:42:02.320 region:rollup2
OF THE DAY WHEN YOU FINISH AFTER

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:03.488 region:rollup2
ONE YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.589 region:rollup2
I WILL BE HERE TEN YEARS FROM

00:42:03.488 --> 00:42:06.190 region:rollup2
NOW BUT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE

00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:07.825 region:rollup2
SITTING HERE AND THEY WILL LOOK

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.227 region:rollup2
AT BILLS MATRIX AND SAID I'M

00:42:07.825 --> 00:42:10.595 region:rollup2
GLAD THEY PUT GO THEN. BECAUSE

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:12.330 region:rollup2
NOW WE SEE THE VALUE OF IT AND

00:42:10.595 --> 00:42:13.498 region:rollup2
WE CAN QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:14.932 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT.

00:42:13.498 --> 00:42:16.100 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT RECEIVED A BAITED THE

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.602 region:rollup2
DELTA NUMBER YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.404 region:rollup2
WE SAVED FAMILIES THAT WE KEPT

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:21.439 region:rollup2
GATHER AND WE CAN ULTIMATELY

00:42:19.404 --> 00:42:23.307 region:rollup2
QUANTIFIED AND SO I. I WOULD

00:42:21.439 --> 00:42:25.076 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE THAT WE DON'T STOP

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:26.644 region:rollup2
HERE THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

00:42:25.076 --> 00:42:28.746 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD.

00:42:26.644 --> 00:42:30.715 region:rollup2
IN A PERMITS.

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:33.584 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THOSE VALUES THAT YOU

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:34.018 region:rollup2
ENUMERATED WOULD ALSO BE OF

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:36.454 region:rollup2
VALUE I THINK IN THE

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:37.088 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

00:42:36.454 --> 00:42:37.655 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING THE LA A

00:42:37.088 --> 00:42:38.956 region:rollup2
NERVOUS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.123 region:rollup2
ADDING MORE.

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.291 region:rollup2
TO.

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:43.394 region:rollup2
A PROJECT LIKE THIS BUT IT BUT

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:44.962 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:46.364 region:rollup2
WE KNOW HOW TO DO THE FIRE CAMPS

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:48.266 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:42:46.364 --> 00:42:49.901 region:rollup2
CDC ARE AND AND FIRE AND WE

00:42:48.266 --> 00:42:51.235 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE

00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:53.237 region:rollup2
OF THE SEAS AND WHAT.

00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:53.838 region:rollup2
WHAT GETS PROVIDED?

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:57.008 region:rollup2
BUT I I THINK SOME OF THIS IS

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:58.576 region:rollup2
IS.

00:42:57.008 --> 00:43:00.678 region:rollup2
WHICH I UNDERSTAND BANG FOR THE

00:42:58.576 --> 00:43:02.413 region:rollup2
BUCK HERE IF YOU WELL AND. HOW

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:04.482 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE BEING SERVED HERE

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:06.951 region:rollup2
WHICH OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY AT

00:43:04.482 --> 00:43:08.352 region:rollup2
RISK OR NOT? BECAUSE AS WE TRY

00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:10.455 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:12.457 region:rollup2
WHERE WE WANNA PUT I RAGS WHAT

00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:14.392 region:rollup2
BASKET AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE

00:43:12.457 --> 00:43:15.827 region:rollup2
THE OVERALL SYSTEM?

00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:16.861 region:rollup2
FALLING BACK ON THINGS THAT WE

00:43:15.827 --> 00:43:18.296 region:rollup2
SORT OF KNOW IT SORT OF

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:20.465 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS.

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:22.100 region:rollup2
IT IS COMFORTING BUT MAYBE NOT

00:43:20.465 --> 00:43:23.201 region:rollup2
ANSWERING ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.869 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ANSWER AND THAT'S

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.871 region:rollup2
KIND OF HOW I TO. KELLY OWES

00:43:24.869 --> 00:43:28.873 region:rollup2
COMMENTS HERE IS IT'S UNCLEAR

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:30.808 region:rollup2
HOW MANY PEOPLE WE BE REACHING.

00:43:28.873 --> 00:43:33.211 region:rollup2
HOW HOW EFFECTIVE THIS IS GONNA

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:34.745 region:rollup2
BE VERSUS OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT

00:43:33.211 --> 00:43:36.147 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD WE COULD BE MAKING

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:37.448 region:rollup2
FOR ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK

00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:39.917 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:41.419 region:rollup2
ALWAYS DO A VERY GOOD JOB?

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:42.386 region:rollup2
WITH A HIGH RISK POPULATIONS AND

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:45.022 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:47.158 region:rollup2
CDC ARE. TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:48.493 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD TO START TO

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:51.329 region:rollup2
MOVE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRISON

00:43:48.493 --> 00:43:52.630 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND LOOK FOR OTHER

00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:53.898 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.399 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BOTH

00:43:53.898 --> 00:43:56.767 region:rollup2
FROM PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:58.936 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE

00:43:56.767 --> 00:44:00.104 region:rollup2
RETURNING FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:01.038 region:rollup2
AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE PUTTING

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:02.473 region:rollup2
THEM TO WORK TO GET IN THE HOUSE

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:04.041 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:05.877 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT GIVING THEM ALL THE

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:07.812 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE THAT WE

00:44:05.877 --> 00:44:08.846 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE AND SO IT'S HARD

00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:10.815 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TO LOOK AT A PROPOSAL

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:11.382 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:12.316 region:rollup2
THE THINGS BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.518 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY KNOW. ALL OTHER

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:14.952 region:rollup2
EFFECTS

00:44:13.518 --> 00:44:16.821 region:rollup2
AND IF WE COME UP WITH A BETTER

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:18.322 region:rollup2
WAY OF WERE OF EVALUATING UP A

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:20.491 region:rollup2
PROJECT LIKE THAT'S. HOW MANY

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:21.926 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WERE SERVING AS OPPOSED

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.894 region:rollup2
UNDER PROGRAM LIKE THIS IN WHERE

00:44:21.926 --> 00:44:24.495 region:rollup2
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:44:22.894 --> 00:44:26.030 region:rollup2
PUTTING OUR INVESTMENTS?

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:28.099 region:rollup2
THAT SEE THE RESULT THAT WE

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.233 region:rollup2
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR.

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:30.501 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.736 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:33.638 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN WOULD BE

00:44:31.736 --> 00:44:35.273 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN IN THIS CONTEXT.

00:44:33.638 --> 00:44:37.708 region:rollup2
SO AND THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT

00:44:35.273 --> 00:44:39.043 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE THE SEAS OR OR THAT.

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:41.012 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS PROGRAM REPRESENTS I

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:42.980 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM? IT'S

00:44:41.012 --> 00:44:44.982 region:rollup2
HOW WE EVALUATE THIS ON THE

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:47.184 region:rollup2
BIGGER PICTURE AND UNDERSTAND

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:48.986 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT IT REPRESENTS TO US

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.987 region:rollup2
AND THAT IT'S MOVING US IN IN

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:51.589 region:rollup2
THE DIRECTION THAT WE ULTIMATELY

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:52.156 region:rollup2
NEED TO GO ON THAT THOSE ARE

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:53.791 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE.

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:53.958 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUESTION.

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.993 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:44:53.958 --> 00:44:57.094 region:rollup2
.

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:58.429 region:rollup2
YOU SAID YOU HAD A WIDOW OVER A

00:44:57.094 --> 00:45:00.331 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN

00:44:58.429 --> 00:45:01.732 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROGRAM.

00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:02.934 region:rollup2
THOUSAND RELEASES FROM FAR THE

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.402 region:rollup2
WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH THE FIRE

00:45:02.934 --> 00:45:05.436 region:rollup2
CAMP WHO WERE RELEASED IN THAT

00:45:04.402 --> 00:45:07.071 region:rollup2
SIX MONTH PERIOD YEAH SO ABOUT

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:07.872 region:rollup2
THE. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:09.774 region:rollup2
ON THEM.

00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:11.309 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO THEM GETTING

00:45:09.774 --> 00:45:13.511 region:rollup2
JOBS OR.

00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:14.912 region:rollup2
WE.

00:45:13.511 --> 00:45:16.614 region:rollup2
AND FATIGUE TO YOUR POINT INTO

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.148 region:rollup2
INTIMATE MISTER SOUNDS POINT AS

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:17.982 region:rollup2
WELL AND AND MISTER JONES

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:19.951 region:rollup2
SAWYER.

00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:21.519 region:rollup2
WE WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF

00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:21.919 region:rollup2
THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM THE

00:45:21.519 --> 00:45:23.154 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS.

00:45:21.919 --> 00:45:24.922 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:45:23.154 --> 00:45:26.791 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OUT

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:28.292 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE A PLACE TO GO WHO'D

00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.261 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE PGA IN IN THE CHEESE

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:31.796 region:rollup2
FIRE PROGRAM WHO HAVE A PLACE TO

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:33.864 region:rollup2
GO STABLE HOUSING ALREADY HAVE A

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:34.432 region:rollup2
JOB A PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
COMMIT TO AN EIGHTEEN MONTH

00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:37.635 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.803 region:rollup2
SO. WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING AT

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:40.738 region:rollup2
LEAST ON THE PURL SIDE IS THAT

00:45:38.803 --> 00:45:41.772 region:rollup2
MANY OF THOSE WHO DO COMMIT TED

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:43.174 region:rollup2
AYE EIGHTEENTH MONTH EIGHTEEN

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:44.875 region:rollup2
MONTH PROGRAM ARE PROBABLY CAN

00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:47.078 region:rollup2
BE THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE?

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:47.912 region:rollup2
CONCRETE HOUSING THEY DON'T KNOW

00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:49.714 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:51.015 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:52.917 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE SOUTHERN REGION

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:54.285 region:rollup2
INITIALLY TO POPULATED FROM

00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.987 region:rollup2
THOUGH SOUTHERN COUNTIES.

00:45:54.285 --> 00:45:57.555 region:rollup2
THAT TENDS TO BE THE HIGHER

00:45:55.987 --> 00:45:59.256 region:rollup2
RISK AND OF THE END OF THE

00:45:57.555 --> 00:46:01.225 region:rollup2
SPIRIT THAT SPECTRUM BECAUSE

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:02.660 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THERE.

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:04.228 region:rollup2
HOMELESS OR THEIR CALLOUS

00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:05.830 region:rollup2
CHIRPING THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:07.565 region:rollup2
ARM WE CAN GET JUST ABOUT ANY

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.634 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:12.103 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM THOSE THOUSAND

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:13.804 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT LAUGHED NAM AS TO

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:15.373 region:rollup2
HOW MANY LEFT IN OUR YOU KNOW

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:17.174 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT IN STABLE HOUSING HOW

00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:19.110 region:rollup2
MANY GOT HIM WILL GOT EMPLOYMENT

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:20.845 region:rollup2
WITHIN SIX MONTHS THOSE KINDS OF

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.879 region:rollup2
THINGS WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT.

00:46:20.845 --> 00:46:23.848 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:25.116 region:rollup2
PROCESS IT WOULD DIFFICULT TO GO

00:46:23.848 --> 00:46:27.118 region:rollup2
MUCH BEYOND THOSE NUMBERS THAT I

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.885 region:rollup2
GOT YOU THERE.

00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:31.088 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD.

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:32.823 region:rollup2
SOME DATA WITH REGARD TO I MEAN

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:34.325 region:rollup2
I THINK MOST OF US HAVE A SENSE

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:35.993 region:rollup2
OF THAT IT. PROBABLY IS A

00:46:34.325 --> 00:46:37.528 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITHIN THAT

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.729 region:rollup2
IS AS AS WAS JUST DON'T POINT

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:39.730 region:rollup2
OUT WHERE THAT IT'S A PROGRAM

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:41.399 region:rollup2
WITH THEM.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:43.534 region:rollup2
GREATEST AMOUNT OF BANG FOR THE

00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:45.002 region:rollup2
BUCK COULD NOT. IS IS WHAT

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:45.836 region:rollup2
BECOMES THE ISSUE AND OBVIOUSLY

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:48.005 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF DATA IT

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:50.207 region:rollup2
BECOMES. EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:51.509 region:rollup2
OUT DO THAT IT IN THE REPORT

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.910 region:rollup2
THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION

00:46:51.509 --> 00:46:53.878 region:rollup2
ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.813 region:rollup2

REFERENCE TO.

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:03.587 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING IS IT.

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:04.789 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THERE

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:07.091 region:rollup2
DEMAND I THINK THAT WAS THE

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:07.258 region:rollup2
OTHER QUESTION IS THEIR DEMAND
