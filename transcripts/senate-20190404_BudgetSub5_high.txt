OPEN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SAFETY IN THE JUDICIARY ON I HAVE SOME -- CHANGES IN THE AGENDA THAT I WILL READ A MOMENT BUT LET'S TAKE A ROLL CALL FIRST. CENTER SKINNER HERE CENTER MORE LUCK WITH CENTER ABOUT. A GREAT SO THE SUBJECT OF OUR HEARING TODAY'S PRIMARILY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE OR ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOUR FIRST YEAR HERE. I'M IN BEFORE YOU COME UP TO THE TABLE. I WON IT ON THE AGENDA THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE US BEFORE YOU ACCUSE ME SHOWS. ON ISSUES ONE THROUGH ELEVEN AS VOTE ONLY WE WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THOSE TODAY. AND WE WILL NOT BE VOTING ON TODAY BECAUSE THE IF IF YOU WERE TO HAVE LOOKED AT THE DETAIL ON THOSE ITEMS. THE IN TOTAL WHILE THEY ALL RELATE. TO BILLS THAT WERE PASSED IN TOTAL THE REFLECTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INCREASE. TO THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. AND WHAT I'VE ASKED STAFF TO DO IS TO GIVE ME A LITTLE MORE ANALYSIS BECAUSE WHEN WE WENT BACK. AND WE LOOKED AT THE U. PROBES ANALYSIS ON THE POTENTIAL COSTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE BILLS. THERE WAS THE GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OR BY OTHER OFFICES. VERSES WHAT'S PRESENTED TO US TODAY SO I WANTED -- TO HAVE STAFF DIG A LITTLE DEEPER ON AND FOR EXAMPLE IF WE TAKE THE ITEM ISSUE TO ON THE SEX OF BENT SEX. OFFENDER REGISTRATION. I'M. THAT BILL. WOODS ULTIMATELY HOPEFULLY REDUCE THE WORKLOAD OF DOJ BECAUSE THE BILL. CHANGES UP UNTIL THAT BILL WAS PASSED CALIFORNIA'S SEX REGISTRY WAS LIFETIME FOR EVERYBODY ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND NOW BILL ADJUSTED IT SO THAT YOU HAD PEOPLE ON SOME PEOPLE IN TEN YEARS SOME PEOPLE TWENTY OR SO -- IN OTHER WORDS LAST TIME ON THE REGISTRY. AND WHEN THE BILL PASSED IN THAT VERY FISCAL YEAR. OR WAS IT LAST YEAR ALWAYS FORGET BUT WHATEVER. WE APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR DOJ AND SOME POSITIONS BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THERE WOULD BE. OBVIOUSLY YOU'D HAVE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO BE ON SOFTWARE THAT THE COMPUTER I. T. I T. IN ORDER. TO THE APPROPRIATELY ADMINISTERED THE CHANGE AND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ON GOING F. T. E. ASSOCIATED. OUR BUT THE ITEM THAT'S ON THAT WOULD ONLY WOULD INCREASE ON TOP OF WHAT WE HAD ALREADY APPROVED THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. EAT. AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF SEX OFFENDERS WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY -- HUNDRED THOUSAND HUNDRED THOUSAND FIVE ENDERS NEW PEOPLE ADDED EVERY YEAR BUT NOW THERE WILL BE PEOPLE BEING TAKEN OFF EVERY YEAR. SO ANYWAY I ASKED STAFF TO GET INTO THE LITTLE MORE DETAIL. ON THOSE DIFFERENT -- ITEMS VERSES ARE TRYING. TO I GO INTO THE WEEDS ON THEM EACH INDIVIDUALLY DURING THIS HEARING SO WE WON'T BE VOTING ON THEM. BUT I WANTED TO RAISE THE ISSUE THAT. I SO AT LEAST THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS WHY WE AREN'T BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE LOOKING AT THE REQUEST FOR THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND KNOWING WHAT WE APPROVED LAST YEAR. AND THE B. C. P. DOESN'T NECESSARILY. INCORPORATE ANY DISCUSSION OVER HOW WOULD USE THE FUNDS WE ARE A PROVIDED. AND WHY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO Y. ON TOP OF THAT THIS NEW -- REQUIREMENT IS SO ANYWAY THAT'S WHY I WANT TO EXPLAIN THAT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE ON OUR LIST FOR DISCUSSION ITEMS TO ISSUES AROUND THE DNA. ONE OF THEM IS JUST THE BACK FILL ON DNA IDENTIFICATION FUND WHICH I THINK WE DO NEED TO DISCUSS. AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS AROUND -- IT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION COST REALART SLATED TO A. B. FIFTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND THAT ONE HIS. WHILE IT'S NOT A HUGE EXPENDITURE. IT'S SIMILAR IN TERMS OF FITTING INTO THE ITEMS THAT YOU SEE ONE THROUGH. ELEVEN ON SO I'M IN A MOVE THAT TO THAT LIST THAT STAFF IS GOING TO GIVE US MORE ANALYSIS ON BEFORE WE DISCUSS SO I'M REMOVING IT FROM THE DISCUSSION AGENDA THAT'S ISSUE. EIGHTEEN AND THEN FINALLY OUR OVERSIGHT ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE. FOURTEEN I'M AND THAT'S ONE THAT ONE IS OVERSIGHT THE REST OF THEM WERE BCP'S I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE END OF IT GEN. RATHER THAN TO BE OUR THIRD DISCUSSION ITEM [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] ALL RIGHT -- SO WITH THAT. WE WILL START. WITH OUR THE GENERAL AND WHOEVER ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO THE TABLE -- AG MISSOURI. AND ON A OVERVIEW AN UPDATE ON DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHANCE TO BE WITH YOU -- I HAVE A TEAM THAT'S HERE WITH ME AS WELL. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU WANT TO PROBE DEEPER IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S BUDGET AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE. IF I CAN START BY SAYING -- A BIG THANKS TO ADJUST THE PERSONNEL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. ALONG WITH FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME FOR THE WORK WE'VE ALL DONE GATHERS A TEAM TO TRY TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH THE PROTECTION AND SAFETY THAT THEY EXPECT. AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE ADVANCE THEIR RIGHTS AS BEST WE CAN TO DEFEND THEM. AND ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA SUCH A GREAT PLACE AND NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I LIKE THE I LIKE JUST A FEW THINGS AND THEN -- THIRTEEN ANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- IT'S I THINK IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT SOME OF OUR PARTICULAR TEAMS ARE DOING BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES IT IS -- NOT KNOWN BY THE PUBLIC JUST HOW MUCH WORK THEY DO. OUR FOR IN. SIXTEEN WHICH I SERVICES MOST OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF PROSECUTORIAL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AND DOES SO WITHOUT CHARGE. TESTED MORE THAN -- TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE GETS LAST YEAR. WE ARE UP TO DATE AND HAVE NO BACKLOG WHEN IT COMES TO THE TESTING OF THOSE VERY IMPORTANT -- EVIDENCE GETS. OUR TAX RECOVERY AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TEAM. WHICH GOES OUT AND TRIES. TO MAKE SURE WITH WERE THROAT VOTE FOR THOSE WHO ARE TRYING. TO UNDERCUT OUR ECONOMY NOT PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TAXES NOT A FAIR WAGES. DO THINGS IN THE WRONG WAY WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO IN THE RIGHT WAY. THAT TEAM -- WHICH WERE COVERED BY THE WAY SOME SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT IT NOT BE PAID AND WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAD BEEN COVERED BY OTHER TAXPAYERS. THAT TEAM LAST YEAR BUSTED A AN OPERATION THE OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF AN OPERATION CALLED RAINBOW BRITE WHICH WAS AN ADULT AND CHILD CARE FACILITY IN THE BAY AREA. THAT FACILITY THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY JUST TAKING CARE OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN WAS ALSO TRAFFICKING IN WORKERS IT WAS DEALING WORKERS WAGES. AND IT WAS TRAFFICKING INDIVIDUALS FOR SEX I AND IN SOME CASES SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES -- WERE BEING RAPED -- THIS OPERATOR OF THIS ADULT AND CHILD CARE FACILITY ALSO WAS FOUND TO POSSESS FIREARMS IN SOME CASES MAINTAINING FIREARMS AT THE CHILD CARE CENTER -- OUR OUR TAX RECOVERING UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TEAM. BUSTED THAT OPERATION AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WITH YOUR SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER THOSE WERE TRYING TO DO THINGS THE WRONG WAY. THE DISADVANTAGE THOSE WANTED WITH THE RIGHT WAY AND COMPLETELY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MANY WOMEN WHO WORK IN THE STATE AND DESERVE TO BE PAID TO WRITE WAGES. OUR BUREAU FIREARMS AGENTS CONTINUE TO DISARM DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS -- QUICK EXAMPLE IN A JINT OPERATION WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT LAST FALL. OUR AGES BECOME BIRD -- SEVEN ASSAULT WEAPONS FIFTY SIX HANDGUNS TWENTY ONE SHOT GUNS TWENTY FOUR RIFLES THREE LOWER RECEIVER OF THE WEAPON. ON TOP OF THAT HE'S MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION. FIFTY HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES ARE AND THAT WAS IN JUST ONE OPERATION WITH. THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. WE HELP SEVEN PUBLIC FORMS RECENTLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS DEALING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THE NEW LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED. THAT WILL -- NOT ONLY BE A LANDMARK -- STATUTE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE ENTIRE NATION NO ONE ELSE HAS DONE THIS. AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING. TO FORMULATE THE REGULATIONS THAT WILL BE USED TO IMPLEMENT ENFORCE THAT LAW THAT WILL GIVE PEOPLE. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS OVER THE INTERNET AND YOUR USE OF THE INTERNET. WE'RE FIGHTING IN COURT AS WE SPEAK TO DEFEND [inaudible] CALIFORNIA'S. CLEAN CAR STANDARDS AND THE NATIONAL CLEAN CAR STANDARDS THAT NOW -- PREVAILED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AS A RESULT OF OUR TEAMS WORK. THERE ARE SOME THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DREAMERS -- APPLICANTS INTO THE DOCK A PROGRAM WHO CONTINUE TO HAVE STATUS -- BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WE DID -- IN PROTECTING THE DOC A PROGRAM FROM ELIMINATION PURSUANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ORDER -- WE SECURED SIGNIFICANT AND IN SOME CASES HISTORIC SETTLEMENTS AGAIN SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN AMERICA A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS -- AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA GAS UNDER TWO MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST. BRITISH PETROLEUM ENERGY. SEVENTY EIGHT A HALF MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST FIAT CHRYSLER. AND THERE ARE MORE. AND WE CONTINUE TO DO ALL THIS AS WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH ANY EXTERNAL THREATS COMING FROM OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA'S WELL. WE FOR EXAMPLE PREVAILED IN OUR LAWSUIT CHALLENGING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ATTEMPT TO ADD A QUESTION ON THE STAND THE QUESTIONNAIRE THAT WOULD DEAL WITH IT IS A SHIP. THAT WOULD HAVE HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS IF WE HAVE A AN UNDERCOUNT OF OUR SENSES COMING UP NEXT YEAR. AND WE CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE AT THAT WILL GO BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT SOON. WE CHALLENGE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S UNLAWFUL ATTEMPT TO FORCE CALIFORNIA. TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS AS EXCERPTED COACH AND AS A RESULT WE WERE ABLE TO PROTECT SOME FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN. JAG FUNDING THAT GOES TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND WE WERE. ABLE TO INTERCEDE IN A CASE THAT PROTECTS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND AS OF TODAY THERE ARE TWENTY ONE STATES. THAT ARE IN THIS FIGHT TO PROTECT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT FROM ELIMINATION. IT'S THANKS TO THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM I JUST WITH THIS -- LEGISLATURE -- BUT WITH OTHER. AGES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND IN MANY OTHER WAYS. WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY -- ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THIS WORK. SO WE HOPE TO BE A CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE THAT. PROGRAM THAT LETS US RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS THEM. A STRONG APPS PROGRAM HE MADE EVEN STRONGER -- WE ISSUED A REPORT THAT OUTLINED SEVERAL WAYS THAT WE COULD DO SO I TO CONTINUE GETTING ILLEGAL WEAPONS OFF OUR STREETS. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THE APPS PROGRAM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF TWENTY SIX POSITIONS THAN FIVE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT. THE GROWING APPS WORKLOAD AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE MEAN BY APPOINT WORKLOAD. INGEST SOME TEN YEARS. KNOWN FIREARM OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. GOING FROM SOME NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND OR SO IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TODAY'S NUMBER OF TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN OUR AGENTS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE NOT HINDERED BY JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES LIMITATIONS SO THAT IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DISARM A DANGEROUS INDIVIDUAL WE HAVE TO STOP. IF WE CROSS THE COUNTY BORDER AND THAT'S WHERE THE WORK OF THE STATE DOJ AGENCY SO CRUCIAL -- I SHOULD MENTION THAT THE BUREAU FORENSIC FORENSIC SERVICES. WHICH HAD DONE YEOMAN'S WORK IN TRYING TO HELP SOLVE CRIMES. IS RUNNING INTO DIFFICULTY BECAUSE THE DNA ID FUND WHICH IT RELIES ON FUNDING HAS BEEN DEPLETED AND CONTINUE TO GO DOWN. BUT THE WORK THAT WE DO ON BEHALF OF HUNDREDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTE. PROSECUTORIAL AGENCY. WOULD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE NOT FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO. IN OUR FRANTIC UNIT TO TRY TO HELP THEM SOLVE CRIME TO PROVIDE THE EFFORTS TO MOVE FOR THE PROSECUTION IN THE CASE AND WE DO ALL OF THAT AS I SAID EARLIER. WITHOUT CHARGING ANY THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PROSECUTORIAL EIGHT THESE A PENNY FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO GET -- DOING THE FRIENDSHIPS WORKED ON THAT. HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH WE CONTINUE SEE GROW CALIFORNIA IS GROUND ZERO FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE HAVE THE MOST ARTS BITES AND WE HAVE THE MOST INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE'RE TRYING TO CONTINUE TO BEEF UP OUR EFFORTS TO GO AFTER THAT. HIDEOUS CRIME. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. TRAFFIC WHICH COULD INCLUDE LABOR [inaudible] FOR COMMERCIAL CHECKS. BUT WHAT WE FIND MOST OFTEN INDICATES WE TRIED TO DEAL WITH -- ARE THOSE OF YOUNG GIRLS MOST OF THEM OFTENTIMES UNFORTUNATELY UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WERE BEING DRAFTED BUT I DID MANAGE THE CASE OF RAINBOW BRITE. WHICH WAS -- THAT. ADULT AND CHILD CARE CENTER THAT WAS TRAFFIC. EMPLOYEES AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AS B. C. NECESSARY WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL HELP US AS WE CONTINUE WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE'VE BEEN HANDED BY. THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR WE NEED MODERN MODERNIZE OUR FIREARMS IT SYSTEMS SO WE NEED TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE. RIGHT ANYMORE TO POSSESS WEAPONS. WE WANT. TO BE ABLE. TO TELL THE AMERICAN TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC THAT WE WILL FORCEFULLY -- INSURE THEIR RIGHTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MANAGING THE REGISTRATION OF KNOWN. SIX NEW TIERED SYSTEM THAT MANAGER YOU MENTIONED AND WE EVEN WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MISSION REGULATE. THE MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTING EVENT RAFFLE PROGRAMS. AFTER PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FINALLY AND AS ALWAYS AS IT'S IMPORTANT STRESS I JUST THE EXCELLENCE OF THE WORK THAT ARE YOU J. PERSONNEL PERFORM -- UNDER VERY CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES IT ALSO POINT TO MENTION THEY DO THEY DO THIS UNDER VERY CHALLENGING INDIVIDUAL CIRCUIT. OUR ENTRY LEVEL DIVISIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE PAID APPROXIMATELY 44% BELOW THE AVERAGE SALARY OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. OUR FORMER YOHJI CRIMINOLOGIST PARALEGALS IN OUR OFFICE WHO HAD MOVED ON TO SIMILAR POSITIONS WITHIN LOCAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE FIRMS. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DOUBLE THEIR SALARIES WHEN THEY LEAVE OUR OUR SHOP. AND OUR HIGHEST SALARIES FOR OUR SENIOR ATTORNEYS. WHO DO TRULY COMPLEX LITIGATION REACHING THE SUPREME COURT? THEIR SALARIES ARE COMPARABLE TO WHAT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES FROM THE PRIEST RISKY JUST LAW SCHOOL COULD MAKE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THEIR FIRST YEAR. OUT OF WHAT. AND SO IT'S A CHALLENGE THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY TO NOT NLY TALK ABOUT THE SUCCESSES OF OUR PROGRAM TO TALK BOUT THE CHALLENGES BUT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND AS I SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING. MOVING FORWARD PARTNERSHIP SO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- LOOK FOR TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IN THE LAND. THANK YOU M.. MR BASURA [inaudible] I'M. I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS R QUESTIONS BUT LE LET MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU. CENTER MORE LOCK. IF YOU'RE GONNA LET ME START. GET A WARM UP FOR YEAH THEN MADAM CHAIR OF GOOD TO SEE YOU ATTORNEY GENERAL DISCERN. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO YOUR OFFICE -- SIX WEEKS OR SO AGO THANK YOU PROJECTED DISCUSS APPS THE ARMS AND PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM. IT'S ALL START THERE WAS SOME SOME CONCERNS -- HAVING ALSO HAD THE JOY OF BEING A DEPARTMENT HEAD IT IS A BIG JOB IT IS FULL TIME. NOTE AND YOU KNOW THIS IT'S A BIG JOB YOU JUST LISTED JUST. MAYBE JUST A FRACTION OF WHAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO YOU INHERIT A SENIOR STAFF. AND AND YOU STEP IN AND HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF MOST OF THE KINKS BUT A YOU KNOW STATING THAT. 44% -- ARE PAID BELOW INDUSTRY AVERAGE -- IN WE KNOW THAT SOME OF YOUR SENIOR. LAWYERS ARE ARE ARE MAYBE IT STARTLED STARTING LEVEL. FOR SO. AS A DEPARTMENT HEAD -- ONE WHY DID THAT HAPPEN IS THAT SOMETHING YOU INHERITED OR IS IT JUST SOMETHING. THAT SENIOR MANAGEMENT WASN'T WORKING ON OR OR WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS OR WHAT WE'RE THAT. EMISSIONS THAT THAT OCCURRED. AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND I NAM THE MEN AND WOMEN AT THE BAR MAJOR SPECIES -- PROBING. I I'D SAY IT'S BEEN IT'S BUILT OVER TIME AND AS YOU KNOW AS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS RUN AN OPERATION. I DON'T HAVE TO CONTROL THE SALARIES FOR FOR THE PEOPLE. BARBARA JUSTICE THAT'S DONE BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES. HAVE AND SO WE TAKE THEM WITH THE SALARIES THAT THEY GET BASED ON THEIR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE DIFFERENT AGENTS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER TIME I THINK ESPECIALLY DURING THE TIME THAT WE HAD A REALLY? MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE STATE WHEN WE HAD A AND ECONOMIC TURNDOWN WAS. WE DIDN'T KEEP PACE. AND SO ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE STATE WAS ABLE TO SAVE SOME MONEY. IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE UP FOR SHORTFALLS WESTON NOT INCREASE OUR AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS PROBABLY MORE CUTE THAN OTHER AGENCIES AS OUR ARCHERY FOR DOUBLE GO TO THE SUPREME COURT. MOST OTHER STATE AGENCY LAWYERS DON'T. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING. TOP NOTCH IN EVERY RESPECT ARE YOUR J. AGENTS. THERE ARE NOT MANY. YOUR TO GO. SEEK OUT PEOPLE WHO ARE DANGEROUS. TO TRY TO DISARM THAT'S WHAT OUR AGENTS DO EVERY DAY. BUT IN THE PROCESS OVERSIGHT. THE SALARIES STOP BEING COMPETITIVE. OUR AGENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THE CHANGEIN PENSIONS. TODAY IF AN AGENT IF AN OFFICER FROM ANOTHER AGENCY COMES UNDER THE OLD THE OLD PENSION SYSTEM. THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY COME AND WORK FOR US UNDER THE NEW PENSION SYSTEM. SO IT'S TOUGH TO RECRUIT OFTENTIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN SALARIES LOWER AND PENSION. BENEFITS WOULD TAKE A HIT SO DO YOU. WELL AT ALL TOGETHER. YES SO MUCH OF OUR WORK AS A BERNESE OCCURS IN THE BIG CITIES. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW TOUGH IT IS TO RECRUIT A PARALEGAL. SAN FRANCISCO. AT THE STATE -- SALARIES FOR A PARALEGAL WE JUST CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR MAKES IT TOUGH. SO THEN THE CENTER MORE LIKE THE POLISH SO I JUST WANTED HIM TO IT. TWO AT ON THIS VERY QUESTION IF YOU COULD EXPAND. AND THEN YOU PROCEED JUST. ORTIZ AGENTS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ALL PART OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT IN ISN'T THIS THE THE I MEAN THIS IS NOT A SALARY SCHEDULE THAT IS SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PART OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT ALL THE FACT EVERYONE OF THE PERSONNEL WHETHER IT'S THE ATTORNEYS. FOR THE PARALEGALS OR THE AGENTS ARE ALL PART OF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING -- AGREEMENT AND SO THEY ARE. FIXED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION. IN THAT THEY NEGOTIATED GOSHI YEAH AND THAT'S GOING TO MY POINT MANAGER I DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH THEM THAT'S I DON'T EVEN COULD CONDUCT THE NEGOTIATION WITH THEM.% AND I DON'T GET TO CHANGE THAT I GET. WHAT THE NEGOTIATIONS? RESULTED IN. AND BY WHAT THE YOUR OFFICE DOZEN NEGOTIATE WITH THEM SORRY IT'S DONE BY THE BOSS GO AHEAD. IF THEM BY THE HUMAN RESOURCES AGENCY FOR THE STATE THEY GOT BECAUSE IT STATEWIDE IT'S NOT JUST THE O. J. AGENTS WERE PART OF THAT CLASSIFICATION STATUS DOJ ATTORNEYS WERE PART OF THE ATTORNEYS -- BARGAINING UNIT IT'S STATEWIDE AND SO THEY ARE STATEWIDE BARGAIN DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE AGENCY IN CHARGE WITH THAT. WELL THEN IF IT'S A STATE WHY WELL. JUST. IT'S HARD. IT'S HARD TO PRECIADO THAT THE ISSUE FOR US ROUTE WITH RETENTION IS. THE SALARY AND BENEFITS. WHEN THE ENTITY? THAT THE IF THEY'VE NEGOTIATED THE SALARY AND BENEFITS AND IT'S NOT A FIXED SALARY SCHEDULE THAT THE STATE IS DETERMINED. AND IT'S NOT EVEN SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD TRY TO CHANGE BY TRYING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE RESOURCES IT WOULDN'T GO TO SALARY. I POINT THAT OUT SIMPLY TO DEMONSTRATE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS SOMETIMES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF WHETHER IT'S RETRIEVING WEAPONS. OR FINDING THE SKILLED ATTORNEYS WE NEED. WITH CREAM COURT. OPINION I JUST WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE GET TO DO OUR JOB. FROM YOU BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY. WITH THE OUTSIDE SECTOR WHEN YOU GOT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT THAT SETS THE TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT PAY AND COMPENSATION. CENTER MORE LIKELY THAT YOU GET TO MANAGE THROUGH THAT COULD YOU STILL HAVE TO GET THE JOB DONE. HE BROUGHT BUT SHOULD LOWERS SO THEN YOU WERE WORK WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A. P.. IN. THAT THAT YOU HIGHER. INDIVIDUALS THAT REQUIRE A COLLEGE EDUCATION AS A MINIMUM. WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT -- SO IS THERE A DIFFERENT WAY TO LOOK AT HOW WE PURSUE THIS BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED IN OUR OUR DISCUSSION THAT. YOU KNOW IF WE GET IT ALL DONE AT THE FRONT END THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL THAN YOU COMING BACK IN THE MAKING THE THREE CONTACT YEAH. SO THEN. INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT HIRING STAFF. IS THERE A WAY FOR YOU TO SAY TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT. YOU TAKE CARE OF IT. AND BILL IS THE TIME. AND THEN WILL REIMBURSE YOU AT THEIR HOURLY RATE. IN THAT WOULD. MAYBE TAKE CARE OF YOUR MANPOWER SHORTAGE WHAT REMEMBER EVEN IF WE WERE TO GO THAT ROUTE. THEY'RE BILLING RATES ARE HIGHER THAN OURS SO WE HAVE TO END UP PAYING MORE FOR THE SAME SERVICE. AND THEY ARE LIMITED BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE JUST PAYING AN HOURLY RATE YOU WOULD BE PAYING FOR A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT U. F. TO EASE SO YOU'RE. RIGHT BUT IF YOU WANT TO GET THE SAME PRODUCTION OVER ONE HOUR FOR ONE DAY OR ONE YEAR IF YOU STILL ARE PAYING MORE PER HOUR PER. MONTH PER YEAR. WHAT WE COULD DO AND THIS IS WHERE THAT WE TO GETTING DIED THIS PAST YEAR AND WHEN WE ISSUED A REPORT? FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE IS THIS ABSOLUTELY. AN OPPORTUNITY TO FOR MORE COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE AS AS YOU JUST MENTIONED CENTER WE SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO RETRIEVE WEAPONS WELL AFTER THE DANGERS PERSON HAS BEEN. ON THE STREETS OR WHO KNOWS WHERE WITHIN CITY CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD RETRIEVE THAT WEAPON WHEN WE HAD THE PERSON IN CUSTODY. AS BEST WE CAN SO WORKING BETTER WITH THE COURTS WORKING BETTER WITH PROSECUTORS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE. WE THAT PERSON LEAVES ARE. OFFICIAL GRASP. WE'VE TRIED TO REMOVE THE WEAPON FROM SOMEONE WHO'S CLEARLY LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS IT. AND THAT'S WHERE THE COORDINATION WHICH REALLY SHOULDN'T COST. OF TOO MUCH MONEY I THINK THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS WILL TELL YOU WE'RE GONNA NEED SOMEBODY. TO SHIFT SOME OF OUR RESOURCES TO DO THIS WORK WITH YOU. BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WILL BE A FOR MORE EFFICIENT WAY THAN JUST HIRING UP A BIGGER FORCE. I WANT TO AFFIRM YOU FOR STAYING CURRENT. THANK YOU A LARGE NUMBER EVERY YEAR BUT WE'RE STILL. WE STILL WE STILL GOT A CRACKED THE BIG NOT THAT JUST KINDA LINGERS SO -- HOW ARE YOU DOING ON YOUR I. T. SOFTWARE YOU ALSO BROUGHT THAT HAPPEN AGAIN AND THAT SOMETHING YOU'VE INHERITED? SO WHAT DO YOU AS A NO. EXCELLENT MANAGER GOING TO DO TO GET THROUGH THAT. AQUA I'M GONNA SIT HERE TALK TO YOU OUGHT TO SEE IF YOU'LL HELP ME BECAUSE WE ARE USING. A IT EQUIPMENT THAT -- I THINK EVEN BILL GATES WAS IN A BILLION OR AT THE TIME THAT WE STARTED USING THIS EQUIPMENT AND SO -- IT IT IS EXTREMELY OBSOLETE AND IT DOES SLOW THINGS DOWN BUT IT'S A BIG SYSTEM. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TRACK SO MANY DIFFERENT DATA POINTS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST SORT OF BY THE NEW COMPUTER AND WE BUT WE WILL NEED TO MOVE BECAUSE IT JUST THE VOLUME OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ENTER INTO THE APPS SYSTEM OR COULD. HAS GROWN AND WE NEED TO TRY TO KEEP PACE AND THE BETTER WE CAN DO IT TO EFFICIENCY FIRST JUST STAFFING UP. THE BETTER ALL THIS WILL BE. AND THEN I'M. WE HAD A  KID A A A BILL AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE BY SOON CHIU. WHICH REQUIRED THE POSTING OF A SIGN IN A PREGNANCY CLINIC THAT SAID THE STATE PROVIDES. THE FOLLOWING SERVICES SORT OF CONTRARY TO WHAT. THEY WERE DOING FOR LIKE TELLING A CHEVY DEALER TO PUT AFFORD. SIGNER LOBBIED DOWN THE STREET OR SOME YOU JUST SEEMED AWKWARD BUT BUT WE DO BILLS AND THEY GET SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THEN THEY GET LITIGATED AND THIS BILL. WAS LITIGATED ALWAYS OF THE STATE THE US SUPREME COURT. AND SO THAT COMES AT A AT A COST IN IN SO. WE HAD ANOTHER BILL THIS WEEKEND ONE OF MY COMMITTEES AND I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT IT LIKE ALL THIS IS GOING TO GO DOWN THE SAME ROAD. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY BUT I DON'T THINK WE KNOW AS LEGISLATORS. HOW MUCH WE'RE INCURRING? FOR A CASE LIKE THIS IS THERE IS THERE LIKE A RANGER AND AMOUNT THAT YOU WOULD. KNOW HOW MUCH WE WE ALLOCATED TO THIS PARTICULAR [inaudible] CASE ANY TIME YOU HAVE TO DEFEND A LINE CORD IT STARTS TO ADD UP ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO UP THE UP THE LADDER. IN IN APPEALS AND CERTAINLY IF YOU'RE GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE US SUPREME COURT THAT DOES THAT AND EXPENSE -- WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSULT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ON VARIOUS MEASURES ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE. INFORMED ABOUT THE OF THE PARTICULAR LEGISLATION SO WE CAN. PROVIDE SOME OF OUR A SENSE ABOUT THE THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS. BUT WHEN YOU DO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT YOU WILL END UP IN A SPENDING GOOD MONEY -- FORTUNATELY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS I JUST PENSION ARE TURNING. ON HIS CLASS THE AS THAT'S LITIGATING AGAINST US -- OUR OUR LEGAL BILL IS USUALLY A LOT SMALLER EVEN THOUGH WE WE HAVE. JUST AS CAPABLE OF NOT MORE CAPABLE FOLKS BUT NO DOUBT THERE ANYTIME YOU HAVE TO DEFEND THE LAW. AND IT'S CONSTITUTIONALITY YOU CAN START SPENDING SOME MONEY. WELL WE WILL. WE I HEAR THE WHISPERS ON THE ON THE ON THE CHAMBER FLOORS LIKE OTHER THE OPTICS IS I CAN'T VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. BUT I KNOW IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT HOW DO YOU VOTE NO AND THEN OFTEN DOES AND AND NOW WE'RE SPENDING MONEY SO. FOR THE FOR A. B. SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WHAT DO WE SPEND TEN MILLION FIVE MILLION ONE MILLION. OR THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION THAT ACTUAL BILL AND HOW WHAT WAS THE COST YEAH DEREGULATION MAYBE I SHOULD ASK DIFFICULT DIFFERENTLY. AT YOUR RUNNING UP ONE OF THE LARGEST LAW FIRMS IN THE NATION DO THEY PREPARE TIME REPORTS WE DO AT WE WE BILL IN DIFFERENT WAYS -- FOR EXAMPLE ON THE CRIMINAL SIDE SINCE WE DO ALL THE APPELLATE WORK. IT'S A DIFFERENTPROCESS THAN ON THE CIVIL SIDE WHERE IT'S IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE WHAT YOU SEE INA LAW FIRM. IN THE BILLABLE HOURS ON THE PUBLIC RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE HE'S -- CASES USUALLY THAT TAKE QUITE SOME TIME TO MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS -- IT'S IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT BUT BUT FOR THE MOST PART YOU CAN TRACK THE COST BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REPORT -- OUR COST TO THE STATE AND SO THERE IS A WAY TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT SOME OF THESE. MEASURES WOULD COST. THE TOTAL WOULD DO IT. WHAT A COSTA WE KNOW WHICH OF THE DRIVER KNOW FIRST ONE PARTICULAR CASE I COULD GET BACK TO I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD? BUT I COULD GET BACK IF YOU LIKE ON I I'M JUST YOU JUST I'M JUST SO I CAN KIND OF SEE OKAY. FOLKS THIS IS GOING TO COST US. YOU KNOW YOUR NAME YOU KNOW DO WE JUST HAD A GOOD HEADLINE IN THE IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE THAT. YOU KNOW WE GOTTA DO THIS FOR YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER WE GOTTA GET UP BY THIS ONE ALWAYS. YOU KNOW IN AND I GET IT BUT IT'S LIKE. BAG I REPORTS TAXPAYERS OPEN ON A NO OVER. SPENDING. WE HAD ANOTHER REASON ISSUE -- WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S DECIDED TO REPRIEVE? SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS OF INDIVIDUALS ON DEATH ROW FOR THE TIRED TIRED TERM. OF HIS GOVERNORSHIP SO I'VE. KIND OF CURIOUS YOU HAVE TO HOLD. THE WIND YOU KNOW TO BE THE WORST OF THE WORST THAT. YOU KNOW YOU WENT THROUGH A PRETTY ELABORATE PROCESS AND WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE GREAT RECESSION WE WOULD DEBATE R. D. A.'S SAYING REALLY HAS BEEN OTHER MILLION DOLLARS. YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. TO GET THE DEATH SENTENCE AND SO NOW IT'S ON HOLD AND I'VE. I I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU'D LIKE. TO LET ME KNOW. YOUR POSITION AS WE GO THROUGH THIS. SO THE THE GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER. TO ISSUE THE REPRIEVE -- OR TO COMMUTE OR DEPARTMENT. AND HE USED THE POWER HAS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO ISSUE THE REPRIEVE. IN THE FORM OF A MORATORIUM FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO SIT ON DEATH ROW -- THAT MEANS THAT DURING HIS TERM OR UNTIL HE CHOOSES TO KEEP THAT QUARTER FORCE THAT. HE HAS THE ABILITY THE POWER. TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE WILL MOVE TOWARDS ACTUAL EXCEPT EXECUTION WHO SITS ON DEATH ROW. HOW THAT? PLAYS OUT MOVING FORWARD. AFTER. GOVERNOR LISA FINISHES HIS TIME. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT THE NEXT GOVERNOR DOES OR WHAT THE PEOPLE THE STATE CALIFORNIA SAY BECAUSE WITHIN OUR CONSTITUTION WE HAVE THE PROVISION THAT PROVIDES FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. AND TO THIS DAY THE THE COURTS INCLUDING THE US SUPREME COURT HAVE NOT HELD THE DEATH PENALTY TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. NOW YOU HAVE HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED WAYS EXECUTED IN WAYS THAT KEEP US WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDS. CROONING UNIT IF YOU'RE A USUAL PUNISHMENT FOR EXAMPLE BUT AT THIS STAGE CALIFORNIA HAS. A PROVISION IN ITS A CONSTITUTION THAT PROVIDES FOR THE DEATH PENALTY AND A HAPPY FALLS ON THE I'M A JUSTICE IS A MENTIONED EARLIER WE DO ALL THE APPELLATE WORK. SO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OF THE WANT TO PROSECUTE THE CASES IT AT TRIAL. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SEEK OUT THE DEATH PENALTY. WHEN THAT CASE IS DONE IF THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY? AND FOUND GUILTY AND SENTENCED TO DEATH. THOSE CASES SHOULD THEY BE APPEAL BY THE DEFENDANT. OR SHOULD THE DEFENDANT TRIED -- TO HAVE THAT. A CASE REVIEWED THOSE CASES AND GO BEFORE THE APPELLATE COURTS. AND AT THAT POINT THE DOCTOR FROM THE JUSTICE OUR JOURNEYS TAKE OVER THE CASES. THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES SEVERAL HUNDRED CASES THAT ARE STILL WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THAT PROCESS. AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY -- TO PROVIDE THE COUNCIL IN IN THOSE CASES AND WE ARE DOING THAT. AND WE'VE GOT PROBABLY THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THEM ALL RIGHT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA SO WHO? YOU WANNA PINE ON THAT. YOU MEAN THE THE SERIAL KILLING ALL THE STATE OR THE STICKER HE'S GOING TO THE PROCESS I BELIEVE THE DESCRIPTOR ANYTHING HAS -- CALL FOR THE THE DEATH PENALTY IF HE IS ULTIMATELY CONVICTED. THAT WOULD WORK ITS WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS WHAT IT MEANS GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S MORATORIUM IS THAT -- SHOULD ANY INDIVIDUAL. WHETHER TO GO THE STATE KILLEARN OR ANYONE ELSE. MOVE ALL THE WAY TO ON TO DEATH ROW. THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD UNDER THE MORATORIUM. NOT AT THIS DURING THE THE TERM OF GOVERNOR HE SAID. NOT BE ACTUALLY EXECUTED. I THINK MADAM CHAIR THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW BUT I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO INTERRUPT YOU WHEN YOU'RE ASKING YOUR IT WOULD BE FINE IN ABOUT -- YES -- I JUST WANT TO SAY PROPOSED CHAIR RUNS THE MEETING AND THE MAJORITY PARTY. POINT TO CHAIR AND YOU CAN ALWAYS TRY TO BECOME SURE BY GETTING A MAJORITY OF YOU FOR MEMBERS SELECTED OKAY. ATTEMPT AT I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT BECAUSE THE CHAIR IS -- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED BY THE DEFINITELY A AND AND I NEVER REALLY. FROM THE LA -- AND OTHER SOURCES. DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE COST OF WHAT IT COSTS TO HAVE DIFF ROLE AND THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED THE APPEALS -- ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- BECAUSE I GET ASKED THAT A LOT YOU KNOW PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT WHAT IS THE COST. TO TO OPERATE THAT AND I WOULD THINK THAT IT COSTS MONEY TO PUT SOMEBODY IN -- PHYSICAL FACILITY OR SAN QUENTIN AND THERE'S A BIG THIRTY YEARS SO -- WOMEN AND SHALL CHILLER. AND I'VE TALKED TO BOTH. I'VE BEEN TO BOTH PLACES MANY TIMES IN ALSO. I KIND OF BEEN IN THERE AND SEE THE FACILITIES -- AND THEN THE LEGAL COSTS THOUGH EVERY EVERY DEATH ROW INMATE PROBABLY HAS A LAWYER I ASSUME RIGHT IS NOT THE REQUIRED THANKS. AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR A CLEAR THE TAXPAYERS. SO THEN YOU HAVE LAWYERS TO DO THE APPEALS AND SO FORTH. AND THEN THERE IS -- HEARINGS IN THE JUDGE'S CHAMBERS AND THEY HAVE TO THAT COSTS MONEY SO SO I'M KIND OF INTERESTED IN -- JUST WHAT HAS ANYBODY EVER FIGURED OUT THE OVERALL COST OF THE SEVEN I THINK IT'S SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY OR SO. PEOPLE. TO THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. IS THAT -- I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS DONE THAT I'M INTERESTED NOT SEE I I'M THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO. I GOT ASKED THAT KIND OF QUESTION I THINK IT'S ON THE IF IF YOU TO WORK WITH THE LA ALL AND TRY TO MAKE SURE WE COVER EVERY COST ME WE CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING. AND ITS ONGOING -- AND EVERY YEAR. GOVERNOR NEWSOME ALSO IN HIS -- MORATORIUM STATEMENT. OUTLINES QUITE A BIT OF THAT ABOUT THE OFFICE AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT I NEVER SEEN LIKE THE WHOLE PITCHER PUT TOGETHER IN. ONE THANK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THAT ARE THE ONLY -- IS. ATTEMPTED TO PULL SOMETHING TOGETHER BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE -- THE TAXPAYER EVERYBODY KEEPS ASKING ME THIS OKAY SO I JUST. MAYBE MAYBE CAN WORK WITH -- ARE -- ILIO ANOTHER STAFF THE BUDGET STAFF THEY COULD PULL SOMETHING TOGETHER SO WE CAN SEE ALL THE MAKE SURE HAS EVERYTHING IN IT YOU KNOW LIKE BALL ACOSTA -- BECAUSE IT THE THE AVERAGE TAXPAYER YOU KNOW THEY DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT WE SHIP THE DEFINITELY NOT BUT THEY ALWAYS OUT US. EVERY TIME. WHAT IS THE COST GENERAL WHAT IS THE COST? NO I I WAS FIGURING YOU KNOW. SOMEBODY TOLD ME ONCE IT WAS LIKE FOR A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER INMATEBUT I YOU THINK IT'S HIGHER SEE EVERYBODY DEBATE. SO I DON'T KNOW I MEAN WE FIND IT IN THE BALLOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSITION TO END THE DEATH PENALTY YEAH BUT THE BUT I I I SAW THAT THE DEAD INCLUDE EVERYTHING SEE THAT'S THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE BALLOT BALLOT PROPOSITION. BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME OTHER CLASSES MORNING COMMUTED SO I I KIND OF I KIND OF I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE -- THAT SHOULD WE SHOULD GET. YOU KNOW LIKE WHAT IT COSTS NOW OKAY THEM JUST [inaudible] YOU KNOW. SAYING THAT THAT SOME NAY WE CAN WORK ON HERE MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF I HAD I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES -- WE'RE FINDING OUT IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT OF THE POLICE HAVE TRAINING IN TERMS OF USE OF FORCE. OUR FROM POST. BUT THEN WE FOUND OUT IN THIS COMMITTEE THE MOST POLICE FORCE. HAVE. TRADING OF USE OF FORCE THAT'S NOT. PART OF CLOSE THEIR THEIR THEY HIRE CONSULTANTS. TO DO THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING AND WE ALSO FOUND OUT THERE'S NO SYSTEMATIC -- LICENSING -- STATE. QUALITY CONTROL KIND OF THINGS ON THE TRAINING OF USE OF FORCE. AND I'M INTERESTED IN THAT BECAUSE I I AUTHORED THE BILLS ON THE TRAINING. FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT WAS PASSED AND NOW WE HAVE A COMPONENT IN THE POST TRAINING. FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ABLE TO RECOGNIZE -- OF SOMEBODY WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OR AUTISM OR OR SOME KIND OF CONDITION LIKE THAT SO THEY'LL BE ABLE. TO UNDERSTAND AND THEN DEVELOP. OF WAYS OF HELPING. US SOMEBODY WITH THAT KIND OF CONDITION SO I'M I'M -- OF I THINK THAT WAS -- ONE OF MY LANDMARK BILLS THAT I DID. SO BUT I AM BUT I'M GONNA LOOK AT POST A SEE THIS USE OF FORCE. IS SORT OF CONFLICTING. MAYBE WITH THE OF MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE IF. IT RELIES TOO MUCH ON INSTINCT IT COULD WIPE OUT THE LOGICAL KIND OF EVALUATED AND THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL ISSUES BEFORE THEY USE FORCE. AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE BILLS ON THE SUBJECT HERE. BUT CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION -- DO YOU THINK THAT -- HOW DO YOU DO WITH YOUR STAFF ON THE USE OF FORCE? DO YOU THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE -- HIGHER LEVELS OF PROTOCOL OR TRAINING OR THESE OUTSIDE TRAINERS SHOULD THEY BE. YOU'RE ALSO QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM OR WHAT WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE. THERE IS A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE LIKE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS YES -- SO -- WHAT WHAT IS YOUR WE WE TRY TO MAKE USE OF THE -- THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WE KNOW OF AND WE TRY TO INSTITUTE THOSE AS BEST WE CAN WE JUST FINISHED -- THE FIRST HALF OF REPORT WE DID -- INVOLVING THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- WHICH I BEGAN LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF CHIEF -- DANIEL HYNES IMITATION -- TO EXAMINE SACRAMENTO'S -- PLEASE -- PRACTICES AND AND POLICIES AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF THE PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY CLICK HERE CALIFORNIA ALREADY. THAT SEEM TO BE THE MOST PROMISING WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF USE OF FORCE. SO WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TELLING FOLKS WHAT SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES ARE WE TRY. TO WHAT DOES A DEFECT IN IN OUR DEPARTMENT. AT THIS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AS WELL. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GONNA FIND IS AS THIS WHOLE DEBATE MOVES FORWARD ON USE OF FORCE AND WHERE. THANK YOU MAY WE TURN TO GO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT MORE MORE INCLUDING WITH THE SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE TRAINING. THE PROTOCOLS. ARE ARE GONNA BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND ESPECIALLY SHOWING THAT THERE WILL BE ACCOUNTABILITY IS A RESULT OF THAT TRAINING IN THOSE PROTOCOS. AND SHOW TO YOUR POINT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS NO ONE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINING. EVERY AGENCY CAN DO WHAT IT WANTS NOT EVERY AGENCY PARTICIPATES IN POSTAGE VOLUNTARY. POST IS OUR STATEWIDE AGENCY TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE AND TRAINING. AND I THINK THE MORE WE GET INTO A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THIS THE FLOOR AT LEAST OF TRAINING MUST BE. I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY GET CLOSER TO FINDING A WAY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT USE OF FORCE. THERE'S THERE'S PEOPLE THAT. JUST KIND OF ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I OBSERVED IS THERE'S PEOPLE FOR THESE ON REGISTERED ALL KHôNG TRAINERS. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE BROUGHT IN FROM OUTSIDE A CALIFORNIA THEIR THEIR THEIR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH CALIFORNIA LAWS. YOU KNOW THAT WE APPROVE. AND THEN THEY TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE USE OF FORCE BASED ON OF CURRICULUM THAT THEY DEVELOP AND THEN THEY FOR MEN AND TRAIN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA. PEACE OFFICERS -- ON THE USE OF FORCE THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF OR VERY LIMITED YOU KNOW NO CREDENTIALED KNOWLEDGE OF LOS. AND THAT KIND OF DISTURBS ME A LITTLE BIT OKAY. BECAUSE HOW CAN THEY TRAIN SOMEBODY ON USE OF FORCE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE CALIFORNIA LAWS OR AND AND THEY MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN. IN GEORGIA OR FLORIDA OR SOME OTHER PLACE. AND I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T THINK. THEREIS ANY REGISTRATION QUALITY CONTROL. YOU KNOW I I SEE SOME OF THE VIDEOS IS SERVE LIKE. YOU KNOW SUBJECTIVE. YOU KNOW THINKING. WARY IF YOU THINK SOMETHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU BETTER ACT FAST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE IN DANGER YOUR PERSONAL SAFETY. SO THIS KIND OF FACTORS ARE VERY -- VERY IMPORTANT -- AND AND I THINK THE PUBLIC IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WE HAVE LAWS ON THIS COMING UP -- I I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR INVESTIGATION OF THAT THE UNREGISTERED. PEOPLE THAT COME IN THERE'S NO. AND PERHAPS YOU COULD ADVISE US ON A PROPER LAW THAT COULD BE DEVELOPED. REGARDING THAT. I CAN ARE YOU. RIGHT OFF THE BAT BECAUSE TRAINING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS LEGISLATIVE. RIGHT CALIFORNIA STATUTE AND THAT EACH AGENCY WHOSE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE TRAINING AND THE AND THE START AT NEW PEOPLE TO START UP. BASED ON TRAINING THAT THEY RECEIVED THAT -- I WOULD I WOULD AGREE THAT THERE'S A NEED TO TRY TO STANDARDIZE THE TRAINING THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT ANYONE WHO WORKS LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA. AS ESSENTIALLY RECEIVED LEAST THAT MINIMAL AMOUNT THAT WE THINK WOULD BE REQUIRED BEFORE YOU START -- PATROLLING STREETS. WHETHER YOU COULD ACTUALLY STANDARDIZED IT. IN A WAY BY STATUTE IS ANOTHER QUESTION BECAUSE WITH YOUR RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY VERSES LA COUNTY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT APPLY AND ALTHOUGH I THINK IF SO LONG AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WERE WHAT WHICH WE'RE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS THE BEST PRACTICES. AND THOSE BEST PRACTICES HAVE TO BE NEW ONES FOR THE DIFFERENT. NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND I THINK WE'LL GET THERE AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE SUPPORT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. YEAH I THINK OF MY IDEAS LIKE SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THESE CURRICULUMS THE MAN. RON YOU KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME IN FROM DIFFERENT PLACES. AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE SAY WELL THAT'S OKAY THAT ONE MEETS OUR STANDARDS. I WAS ON SOME KIND OF PROCESS FOR THAT YOU KNOW. AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS A LOT OF PROFESSIONALISM IN THIS AREA WHERE YOU HAVE. A NUMBER OF ENTITIES AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ON THE TASK OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THOSE BEST PRACTICES AND SO YOU CAN TURN TO SOME REALLY -- NOT JUST DOWN TO FOLKS WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD BUT WHO SHOWN THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE THE PRODUCT WHEN IT COMES. TO A BEST PRACTICES YES OKAY I HEARD I HADN'T -- PASS LAWS HERE AND WE EXPECTED FORCE ONE OF OUR LAWS THANK YOU AND AND YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SAYS AS TO DO A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT -- SOMETIMES WE PASS LAWS IN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS. OKAY OR OTHER AGENCIES THEY DO THAT AND ONE OF THE LAWSUIT WAS PASSED YOUR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO FORCE. IS SB -- FIFTY FOUR THIS IS OUR STATE LAW REGARDING -- IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR SOMEONE FOR SPACES THAT DON'T WANT TO ENFORCE THE PUBLIC HAS STATED. THEY WON'T ENFORCE THE LAW. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE PASS A LAW. AND PEOPLE SWEAR TO UPHOLD THE LAW THEY MAKE A SWEARING STATEMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IT AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THE SHOULD NOT QUESTION. ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO ENFORCE THE LAW. THE OTHER RUN FOR OFFICE AND HELP. WHAT WHOEVER THEY WANT TO GET ELECTED IN AND GO THROUGH A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS? SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON ON SB. FIFTY FOUR AND AGENCIES THAT HAVE. PUBLICLY STATED. THAT THEY DO NOT. WANT TO ENFORCE SB. FIFTY FOUR IF I CAN BEGIN BY SAYING STARTED TO CENTER MORLOCKS POINT -- THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOUR LAWS ARE ACTUALLY CONSTITUTIONAL SB FIFTY FOURTH PROTESTED. RIGHT IT HAS BEEN FOUND CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THIS IN STATE CALIFORNIA OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THE STATE BELIEVES IT'S IT'S PRIORITIES AND FOR US IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND NOT DOING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND SO. WE'VE ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION IN COURT -- DEFENDED AND ONE ON SB. FIFTY FOUR I WILL TELL YOU CENTER AND I'M I'M I'M I INVITE YOU TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION ON SOME OF THESE AGENCIES BUT MOST OF THE AGENCIES I'VE DEALT WITH UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THE FORTUNE SB FIFTY FOUR BECAUSEI THINK THEY REALIZE THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THE COOPERATION OF THE FOLKS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IF THEY'RE PERCEIVED AS TWENTY TWO IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT -- FOR FOR ICE AND SO WHETHER IT'S SOUTHERN PART MIDDLE PART UPPER PART OF THE STATE I THINK MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS HEY YOU KNOW WAT. IF THIS IS A LOT GOING TO TRY TO DO IT NOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ARE ROGUE YOU KNOW YOU GOT YOUR FREE AGENTS SOMETIMES A WHAT DO SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY. WELL THAT'S A PUBLICLY SO I'M KIND OF LIKE. AND LISTEN TO THEIR THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS RIGHT SHERIFF'S EVEN -- SO THEY MAKE STATEMENTS I MEAN IT'S IT'S LIKE. IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN THAT. CERTAIN SHARES OF SAID. THEY DON'T WANT TO FORCE SB FIFTY FOUR AND EVEN IN CASES WHERE PUBLIC COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY CERTAIN ELECTED OFFICIALS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION. IT'S NOT BEEN THE WITH THE DEED IS NOT CONFORM TO THE WORD AND SO BUT WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO ALL THE AGENCIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SB IFTY FOUR SO LAW THE STATE AND IT'S OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING ENFORCED AND SO YOU HAVE A LOVELY VIEW OR SOME KIND OF PROCESS TO REVIEW -- CASES THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN THE INTERACTION WITH THE IMMIGRATION -- IS THERE A WAY TO AUDIT. OR OR TO LOOK AT THOSE CASES. WHERE COMMUNICATION WAS GIVEN -- REGARDING -- FROM FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT REGARDING YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT MAYBE AT A PARKING TICKET OR TRAFFIC TICKET OR THOSE KIND OF OFFENSES THAT. WE PUT IN SB FIFTY FOUR IS NOT. PERTINENT. WE PUT THE SERIOUS CRIMES OF COURSE IN THERE. TO ALLOW THAT KIND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION BUT SOME OF THESE OTHER CRIMES SERVE LIKE. ROUTINE TRAFFIC TICKETS. OTHER TIMES A MINOR MINOR ISSUES. WE A WE HAVE PUT OUT THE WORD WE PUT OUT GUIDANCE IS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO SAID TO GIVE. OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA A SENSE OF HOW -- THE WAS IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED AT LEAST GIVING THEM GUIDANCE AS TO HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL EXPECT THEM TO BE ENFORCED. AND THEN WE WILL -- TAKE ON ANY MATTER IF SOMEONE BRINGS -- INFORMATION TO OUR ATTENTION THAT MAY SHOW THAT WAS MAY NOT BE -- ENFORCE THE WAY THEY SHOULD ARE NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED THERE WAS A TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS WELL. AS LONG FIRST REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE [inaudible] IF THE GAVE INFORMATION TO ICE THE ARMY TO CLOSE THIS CLOSE IN FROM YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE. GIVING INFORMATION TO ICE. ARE THEY REQUIRED TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE. THE SALMON -- I'D I KNOW NOTHING THAT AFFIRMATIVELY REQUIRES THEM TO DISCLOSE BUT THEY HAVE TO RECORD ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES AND SO THERE WOULD BE A RECORD OF ANYTHING THEY'RE DOING AT LEAST. MAYBE DOCTOR SAYING BUT CERTAINLY ANY ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE UNDERTAKING THEY PROBABLY HAVE RECORDS OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH. IN MOST CASES -- INDIVIDUALS EITHER. HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OR IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM YEAH OKAY -- ANOTHER. ONE AND THE LAST QUESTION I'M SURE I JUST -- THREE THE AND THAT'S IT THE ICE. THE HAS CONTRACTED WITH PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO RUN. FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS A PRIVATE OWNED FACILITIES THAT. HAVE CHILDREN OF VARIOUS PEOPLE IN THEM OF THE DIFFERENT LEVELS -- HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY [inaudible] EXAMINE OR DETERMINE THE QUALITY OR ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IT SEEMS TO ME IF A PRIVATE FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF THEY'RE NOT A FEDERAL FACILITY EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE A FEDERAL. CONTRACT AND THEY'RE MAKING A PROFIT OR MONEY OFF OF THE FEDERAL CONTRACT ASSUME THAT. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY DO IT RIGHT? THEY SHOULD -- THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE OUR STATE. LICENSING LAWS REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- THE DISABILITY RIGHTS ORGANIZATION -- RECENTLY WROTE A REPORT. THAT WE RECEIVED ON THE FACILITY IN. A TOWN ON A BLUE IS ADELANTE. LARGE FACILITY THERE THAT THEY'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT CLOSING CITY VALENTI. I THINK GOT A HOLE THAT RECORDS SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. WHERE THEY HAD CHILDREN IN A PRISON LIKE ENVIRONMENT SO -- WITHOUT. IS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WE DO TO REGULATE PROPERLY THESE PRIVATE FACILITIES. PRIVATE PRISONS IF YOU WILL THAT ARE LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW WOULD WE WOULD WE WOULD. WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND WE DO REGARDING THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES FACILITIES TO ASSURE THE OBSERVER? THE STANDARDS WHICH WE HAVE FOR FACILITIES WITH CHILDREN AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT -- YOU'VE ALREADY IN QUITE A BIT AS YOU KNOW -- IN PROVIDING THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE WITH THE AUTHORITY TO INSPECT THESE VARIOUS CIVIL IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES. WE JUST ISSUED OUR FIRST REPORT -- AFTER THAT WATER PERFECT I CAN MENTION A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND YOU ALSO -- PROVIDED -- FOR RESTRICTIONS ON WHEN A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CONTRACT. A USING PUBLIC RESOURCES WITH IMMIGRATION -- AUTHORITIES TO DETAIN PEOPLE AND SO ON THE REPORT THAT WE ISSUED AND WE DID GO TO OTHER UNTIL AS WELL -- BUT WE DID HAVE LIMITED -- ACCESS BECAUSE ICE WOULD BURST RESTRICTED HOW MUCH WE COULD DO BUT WE HAVE. ADDED LITIGATE THAT LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED THEY GAVE US THE AUTHORITY. TO INSPECT THE VARIOUS I THINK OR TEN OR ELEVEN DETENTION FACILITIES. AND WE HAD IT HAS SURVIVED A TESTED IN COURT AND SO WE CONTINUE TO INSPECT I WILL AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM TRYING TO REACH CONTRACTS WITH ICE TO DO THE DETENTION WORK. BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE. SOME LIMITED CONTROL OVER WHAT'S DONE. AND AND I THINK SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM DOING THAT. YEAH THE DISABILITY RIGHTS SO ORGANIZATION THAT DID REPORT THEY HAVE A FEDERALLY. A FEDERAL STATUTE RIGHT TO INSPECT THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL AS A STATE STATUTE RIGHT TO EXPECT THOSE FACILITIES WITHOUT HINDRANCE. SO THEY'RE ALLOWED A MUCH BROADER. OF ALLOWANCE FOR INSPECTING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT CIVIL RIGHTS ON THE DISABILITIES KLAY -- PRESENTED -- THE INFORMATION. TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS IN THE SENATE. THEY CAME TO OUR MEETING AND DID A PRESENTATION ABOUT. EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IN THOSE FACILITIES AND WE WERE SHOCKED WE WERE QUITE FRANKLY SHOCKED AT THE WAY CHILDREN ARE TREATED AS PRISON INMATES. AND I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH THE KIDS AND THE WAY THEY'RE BEING TREATED. WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ACT QUICKLY TO PREVENT ANY OF THESE FACILITIES EVER TREATED CHILDREN'S AS PRISONERS IN IN IN A AND TOLERABLE. MANNER. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL THEY WERE TREATING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OF SOMEBODY HAD A FOR EXAMPLE SOMEBODY HAD. A MENTAL HEALTH OF TRAUMA. REACTION TO BEING IN IN ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES -- THEY WOULD BE PUT IN A SHOE FACILITY AND THEY'RE LIKE A SEGREGATED HOUSING. ISSUES. EN EN OF THESE DETENTION FACILITIES AND YOU KNOW LOCKED IN A SINGLE CELL WUSHU FACILITY. WHICH IS LIKE THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO FIRST. TRAUMA PSYCHOTIC BREAKDOWN HAPPENING YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD THAT SHOULD BE A MEDICAL ISSUE. TO TREAT HIM WITH THE MEDICAL CARE. SO SO I THINK THE I THINK WE NEED. HIGHERLEVELS OF INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF STATE LAWS. OUR REGARDING THOSE RESOURCES I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. FROM YOU IN THE ADVICE OF WHAT FURTHER WE COULD DO IN THAT AREA IF YOU IF YOU. I THINK THE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT CIVIL RIGHTS THING IT MIGHT. THE THE AUTHORITY YOU GAVE US TO CONTINUE DOING THE POTENTIAL WORK IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE PROBABLY THE THE THE THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECT OF THAT WORK IS THE FACT THAT. THESE CENTERS KNOW THAT. WE'RE GONNA GO IN AND INSPECT. AND IT. SUNSHINE IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT AND SO THE MORE THAT WERE ABLE TO ASK SOME LIGHT. ON THE CENTERS I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE CENTERS WILL TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY HAVE EITHER CONTRACTS OR GOVERNMENTAL OF THE THIRTY TO DO THE DETENTION. THEN I I THINK WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN. WITH THE LAWS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO PRO PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU MENTION. AND SO I'D SAY THAT IF YOU CONTINUE TO JUST SUPPORT -- THE LEGISLATION THAT NOW IS LAW THAT ALLOWS US FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS. TO DO THOSE INSPECTIONS THAT THAT WILL BE A GREAT WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE DEGREE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE DETENTION IMMIGRATION CIVIL IMMIGRATION DETENTION IN CALIFORNIA. AT LEAST WE KNOW THAT THE THE RIGHTS AND OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THOSE FACILITIES WILL BE PROTECTED AND THE CONDITIONS WILL BE WHAT ARE EXPECTED CALIFORNIA LAW. DOES DOES CENTERED RAZA WHO'S GOT A LEGISLATION -- ON THE SUBJECT AND SHE WAS AT OUR MEETING. AND PASSED OUT THE INFORMATION SHE'S GOING TO ATTEMPT. TO WORK WITH ALL OF US SAID THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS -- AS THE LEAD IN THE SENATE ON THE SUBJECT SO. WE WE WE REALLY THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT -- THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT. THE THE CHILDREN AND JUST EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THOSE FACILITIES ARE TREATED. IN A MATTER CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT WE HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CERTAINLY. AND CENTER MORE LEFT. YOU MAY -- YES [inaudible] I'M YES. THE APP S. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE GOING TO END. IS THAT CORRECT. SO WE HAVE TO KEEP CAñADA AUTHORIZED THE THE APPS PROGRAM AND SO -- THE WORK WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE DOING IT AND THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE. AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO HAVE THE APPS IS A PROGRAM WORK WHICH ALLOWS OUR AGENTS TO GO OUT AND AND AND DO THIS WORK WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE GET. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT. RICK IN OUR GIVE ME SOME MORE OF YOUR THINKING SO I UNDERSTAND BETTER WELL IF IF IF WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO RE AUTHORIZE. AND I'M UST TRYING TO MAKE SURE I GOT IT YOU SHOULD BE DOING THE APP YES. CONSTANTLY RIGHT INTO YOU GET DOWN TO ZERO RIGHT. RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT REPORTING COMPONENT IS. BEING ELIMINATED IN SO I'M WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CONTINUE SO WE HAVE THE IT'S PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE TO ASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANY QUESTIONS YOU'D LIKE ON APPS WE DO HAVE THAT. WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO EVEN MORE DISCUSSION. ON THAT ONE BECAUSE WE HAVE IT ON OUR IT IS LITERALLY THE NEXT ISSUE ITEM. AND WE CAN GET INTO MORE DETAIL WHICH I HOPE TO ALSO ON AND ONE MORE QUESTION CERTAINLY YES THIS ONE IS THE THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY AND I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG EIJI STAYING BUT THIS OPPORTUNITY AS OVER OVER VIEWS AND THEN WE'RE GOING MORE DETAIL NO NO YOU GO AHEAD. NO GO AHEAD GO AHEAD -- THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT -- WOULD PROVIDE MORE FULL DISCLOSURE YOU JUST USED ARM. SUNSHINE IS REALLY. BUT IT SEEMS WITH RELATING TO SB ALL FORTY ONE THAT YOU'RE. NOT RELEASING INFORMATION THAT CASE THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SB PUTS RIGHT THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. THANK YOU FOR DYSLEXIA. I'M SORRY MANAGER. THAT ARE ASKED ME THE QUESTION AGAIN PLEASE. FULL DISCLOSURE. FOR POLICE RECORDS AND THE REST SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR THIS FROM MY READING THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT BEING COOPERATIVE WITH THIS SUNSHINE OPPORTUNITY -- AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. BECAUSE I THINK THE THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ACHIEVE THIS MILESTONE TO PASS. THE THE LEGISLATION -- WAS WAS CRITICAL. TO THAT TRANSPARENCY. IN THE PROCESS OF PASSING THE LEGISLATION -- THE THE NEW THE NEW LAW NOW. CHANGES A REGIME WE HAD BEFORE WHERE SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WOULD NOW BE DISCLOSED. USED TO BE CONSIDERED PRIVATE INFORMATION. AND A QUESTION QUESTIONS BEGAN TO BE RAISED ABOUT WHETHER. THE THE LAW WOULD APPLY MOVING FORWARD FROM THE DATA BECAME EFFECTIVE. OR IF IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL DATA THAT'S BEING HELD INCLUDING PRIVATE DATA THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD PROTECTIONS UNDER LAW. FOR PRIVACY REASONS. I I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY. YOUR ONE CHANCE TO DO IT RIGHT IF YOU. AND FINE BUT IF YOU DISCO SO MUCH PRIVATE INFORMATION AND YOU WERE WRONG. YOU CAN'T UNRING THAT BELL. THAT PRIVATE INFORMATION IS NOW OUT THERE. FOR EVERYONE TO SEE AND YOU CANNOT SORT OF PULL IT BACK. AND SO BECAUSE THERE WERE CONFLICTING -- ACTIONS BY OUR COURTED TRYING TO INTERPRET -- SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE POSITION I TOOK WAS THAT AS SOON AS I HAVE A A CERTAINTY OF A POSITION FROM THE COURTS. I WILL DO IT WE'RE READY TO DISCLOSE IF THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS SAY IN FACT WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN COURT ON A CASE IT APPLIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHERE [inaudible] STATEMENT. THAT IF BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION THE DATA THREE TWENTY NINETEEN SHOULD ALSO BE DISCLOSED. SO I I HAVE A FEELING WE SEE WHERE THE COURTS ARE GOING TO TAKE US. AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE. ANOFFICIAL DECISION ON THE MERITS WILL BE PREPARED TO ACT BASED ON THAT MITCHELL DECISION -- THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF CASES THAT HAVE COME UP. SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE SAID THE INFORMATION THREE TWENTY NINETEEN SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SAID THAT ARE SAID TO HOLD OFF STILL AS WE GET CLOSER TO DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE CASE. I HOPE SOON THAT WILL HAVE A OF A RESOLUTION ON THE MERITS. SO THAT DAHLE AGENCIES WILL HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THEY COULD OF PUT FORWARD THIS INFORMATION. WE ARE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SACRAMENTO CASE OF THE STUFF ON CLARK SHOOTING -- BECAUSE WE DID THAT IN COOPERATION WITH THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT -- IN THE SECOND POLICE DEPARTMENT AS INDICATED THAT IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE ALL THE ALL THE RECORDS THAT WERE USED. DURING IT THEIR INVESTIGATION OF THE SHOOTING -- BECAUSE WE WERE PART OF THAT I'VE MADE THE DECISION. AND I HAVE THE DISCRETION TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO DISCLOSE IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE OF THAT INVESTIGATION WE WILL DISCLOSE ALL RECORDS THAT WE HAVE WERE PRIVY TO AS WELL. INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE PRE. TWENTY NINETEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR [inaudible] CERTAINLY. I WILL A TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE BUT I WANTED TO RETURN. TO SEVEN BECAUSE THIS OPENING IS SORT OF THE OVERVIEW. AND WHAT I NOTE I RAISED IN MY COMMENTS IN CHANGING THE AGENDA THAT THERE'S ON THAT MANY OF THE BCP'S RE RECEIVED THIS YEAR. ARE ALL GENERAL FUND INCREASES NOW. YOUR DEPARTMENTS BUDGET WHICH IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT IS BEFORE US WOULD GO UP TO ABOUT A BILLION. IN THIS UPCOMING YEAR IT'S A MIXTURE OF GENERAL FUND AND SPECIAL FUNDS -- AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED LAWS THAT TO INCREASE YOUR WORKLOAD. BUT INTERESTINGLY WE HAVE ALSO PASSED MANY LAWS THAT WOULD DECREASE YOUR WORKLOAD AND YET WHAT THE PATTERN THAT I SEE. IS NOT BCP'S DIRECT KNOWLEDGE THE DECREASE IN WORKLOAD BUT RATHER CONTINUAL ONGOING ASSUMPTIONS OF INCREASING WORKLOAD. AND WHAT I NOTE FOR EXAMPLE IS THE PERIOD. FROM. THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET TO THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WAS A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND INCREASE. SO ISN'T THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL GENERAL FUND INCREASE SINCE. OVER A DECADE AND THEN BE INCREASE THAT'S BEING ASKED THIS YEAR FOR CHEN JUST GENERAL FUND WE'RE NOT TALKING ALL THE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS. IS THIRTY SEVEN MILLION SO NOT AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE SIXTY BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT IF IF I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE. THE GOVERNOR IN HIS PRESENTATION OF A BUDGET RAISES THE ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE -- FAR MORE UNIVERSAL EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR OUR ZERO TO FOUR KIDS. NOW THE GOVERNOR DID NOT PROPOSE IN THE BUDGET FINDING THAT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE TO DO IT BUT THE FUNDING THAT HE ID PROPOSE TO BEGIN TO EXPAND THAT WERE ALL ONE TIME ONLY. AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE IN LEAST IN HIS ARGUMENT THAT WE HE COULDN'T PROJECT THAT WE WOULD HAVE ON GOING REVENUES TO JUSTIFY. THE ON GOING EXPENSE. SO WHY I RECESSES BECAUSE EVERY DOLLAR SPENT IN GENERAL FUND -- WE SPEND WE AUTHORIZED IN GENERAL IS COMPETING WITH AGAINST EVERY OTHER GENERAL FUND. EXPENDITURE AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THAT TOTAL. AND I LOOK AT LAWS THAT WE ALSO PASSED THAT REDUCED WORKLOAD -- I I DON'T SEE -- I DON'T SEE THE SAME RECONCILIATION FROM THE AG'S OFFICE. ROGER I'M -- INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHERE YOU THINK THAT OUR WORKLOAD HAS GONE DOWN BECAUSE THE SEX OFFENDER WILL MAKE YOUR WORKLOAD GO DOWN. AND MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS BUT NOT RIGHT NOW KNOWN WE GAVE YOU TEN MILLION LAST YEAR AND POSITIONS TO ASSIST THAT AND CERTAINLY IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ADEQUATE. BUT IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT ANOTHER SEVENTEEN MILLION IN THIRTY SEVEN F. T. E. ON GOING NOT ONE TIME WOULD BE NEEDED GIVEN THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT THE WORKLOAD WILL GO DOWN OVER TIME. VENTURE LIBYA AMID ASK CHRIS RYAN WHOSE WE I DON'T WANT TO GO IN TO GET INTO THAT WHEN IN GREAT DETAIL THIS IS A OVERVIEW. OKAY BUT I I I SHOULD HAVE A SENIOR JUST IN CASE I SEE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT CORRECT -- BECAUSE HE'S A HEAD OF OUR OUR OUR BUDGET IS HEAD OF OUR OPERATIONS DIVISION BUT ALSO -- IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BUDGET. WHAT I'LL TELL YOU WITH REGARD TO THE SEXUAL OFFENDER MATTER? BECAUSE THE TEARING SYSTEM IS ONE WHERE WE CANNOT GET IT WRONG. IF WE MISS CLASSIFY. A AND OFFENDER AS OF LESS. SERIOUS OF AN OFFENDER THAN WHAT HE OR SHE MAY TRULY BE AND AS A RESULT THAT PERSON IS REMOVED FROM. IDENTIFY LESS. WITH NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE THE THE THE THE CHURCH WE MAKE THE WRONG DECISION. AND SO BECAUSE THIS IS A TOTAL CHANGE IN THE WAY WE CLASSIFY. WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET IT DONE IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WAS CALLED FOR BY THE LEGISLATURE. CHRIS CAN GET INTO THE DETAILS AT SOME POINT LATER IF YOU LIKE BUT WHAT WE ASK FOR WAS JUST SO THAT WE COULD MEET. THE PHARMACIST OR OR THE REQUEST THAT WERE MADE IN THE LEGISLATION FOR US TO BE TO MEET. THAT SEX OFFENDER TEARING PROCESS. WHICH IS A GREAT GREAT THING TO DO BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO IS A VERY LOW LEVEL OFFENDER HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COULD NOT BE CLASSIFIED. WITH THE WORST THE WORST. IT'S JUST THAT WE CANNOT MAKE A MISTAKE. AND SO WE'RE WHAT WE DID WAS WE AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAUSE YOU GAVE US A CHANCE TO REALLY DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IS TO BE ASKED TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER. WHEN YOU BASS? BUT I WE CAN I DON'T WANT T GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON IT NOW BECAUSE MY STAFF WILL HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU WHICH YOU CAN THEN WE CAN GO INTO DETAIL ON IT LATER BUT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE NONE OF US WANT TO HAVE. ANYBODY WRONGLY PUT ON A TWO YEAR. IT'S HARD TO SEE WHY WE WOULD NEED THIRTY SEVEN NEW F. T. E. ON TOP OF THE F. T. EITHER WE GRANTED TO ACHIEVE THAT. WHEN THEY'RE SAID NO MORE THAN FOR ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SIX VENDORS ADDED PER YEAR BUT WE WILL GET INTO THAT DETAIL LATER? WE'RE GOING TO SOME OTHER ISSUES -- AND WE'LL GET MORE INTO THIS IN THE APPS DISCUSSION BUT FOR EXAMPLE SENATOR MORE LOCK RAISED. THE ISSUE AROUND THE LOCAL AGENCIES. AND YOUR RESPONSE WAS YES IN MANY CASES ARE LOCAL AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS ARE PAID BETTER THAN OUR STATE. ON IN JUST STEPPING BACK MY POINT ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THING WAS MORE THAT IT WAS. IT FELT TO ME LIKE WE WERE DESCRIBING OURSELVES AS A VICTIM OF SOMETHING VERSES OF SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE INFLUENCE OVER. CERTAINLY SO THAT THAT WAS WHY I INTERVENED IN THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING JUST BECAUSE WAIT A MINUTE WE'RE NOT IT'S THIS IS NOT JUST. THROWN DOWN ON US WE HAVE THERE IS A ROLE WE HAVE BEEN IF WE FEEL THAT. THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE MADE WITH THE SET OF STAFF THAT ARE FULFILLING AN OBLIGATION WE FEEL WE HAVE AND IT'S NOT ADEQUATE. FOR IS NOT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION TO RETAIN THE POSITIONS THAT THAT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION BUT THAT SITE THAT'S WHY RAISE THAT BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS SOMEWHAT FIXABLE. NOW. ON THE ISSUE OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BEING PAID BETTER THAN MANY OF OUR STATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS TRUE HOWEVER. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN MANY PLACES SEVEN ELM STREET IS ALREADY. JOINING IN IN ENFORCING THE APPS. NOW. IF WE MANDATE THAT THEY DO. YES WE HAVE TO FULLY COVER THE COSTS [inaudible] WHAT [inaudible] IF WE ENGAGE IN COOPERATION WITH THOSE AGENCIES THAT ARE MORE THAN WILLING. TO AND CLEARLY IN OUR MATERIALS IT EVEN DESCRIBES HOW MUCH TRAINING AND ALL. THE YOUR OFFICE HAS DONE WITH DIFFERENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO EQUIP THEM TO DO SO. AND ON ANY YET WHEN DATE HAVE BEEN DONE SIGN DONE SO. WE HAVE NOT COVERED THEIR COSTS WE'VE COVERED THE TRAINING OF IT. AND WE CERTAINLY COVER YOUR COSTS FOR UPDATING. THE APPS WHEN THEY RETRIEVE THE WEAPON BUT WE'VE NOT. REIMBURSE THE AGENCY. FOR BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO UNLESS WE EITHER MANDATED OR DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THEM TO DO SO. SO I THINK THAT. WHAT? MANY OF US AND WE CAN GET INTO MORE DETAIL WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS IN THE THE NEXT I AM BUT I THINK ROOM. WHAT MANY OF US ARE IN YOU MADE THE POINT THAT [inaudible] DEAR J.. IS BY ITS NATURE A CERTAIN SIZE. WE DO HAVE A VERY LARGE STATE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE. PRESENCE OF DOJ LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SUCH NUMBERS ACROSS THE STATE TO BE ABLE. TO ADEQUATELY HIT ALL THE G. WERE HUGE STATE. I'M FOR THAT ENFORCEMENT OF APPS. WHEREAS WE KNOW WE HAVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EVERYWHERE. AND SO THE MORE THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE MORE WE CAN ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO. THE BETTER BECAUSE IT HELPS ENSURE THAT OUR OBJECTIVES IN GETTING -- WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE PEOPLE ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST. ON SO I THINK. AND I AM NOT TOO DON'T WANT -- TO INTERPRETER SPEAK FOR MY A COLLEAGUE ON THE DICE BUT I THINK THAT FOR MANY OF US WE WANT TO SEE. MORE OF THAT ENGAGEMENT. AND WE ARE WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LOCAL THAT REALLY DON'T WANT. TO BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THEY REALLY DO WANT TO AND SO. THE END BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT. AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE MAY NOT BE LEGITIMATE INCREASES THAT. THE DOJ MAY NEED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT CERTAINLY I WOULD NOT I CANNOT ENTERTAIN. TRYING TO INCREASE DOJ TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING CAPACITY TO COVER THIS ENTIRE STATE. JUST BECAUSE THE NATURE OF THE MANAGER THE THE REQUESTED FUNDING WHICH OF THE GOVERNOR -- INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET DOES NOT -- TAKE US TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD COVER THE ENTIRE STATE. IT'S SIMPLY RIGHTS THIS EXPAND TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM. THEN WE CAN COVER AND SO -- WE ARE. FOR FAR FROM GETTING ANYWHERE CLOSE TO BEING ABLE TO TRULY COVER THE ENTIRE STATE. BUT I CAN -- AGREE COMPLETELY THAT WE COULD -- WORK CLOSER WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO IN SENT THEM TO WANT TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY CAN ALREADY DO IT AS YOU'VE MENTIONED IT IS I'VE AND MANY HAVE. MANY HAVE. IN LIMITED WAYS. IN VERY LIMITED WAYS. LA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IS A IS ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS THAT REALLY DOES WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT LA COUNTY HAS THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE APPS SYSTEM. AND THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM IF THEY'RE THESE FOLKS ARE ROAMING THE STREETS SO THEY WANT TO WORK CLOSE TO THAT. BUT I COULD GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF A CASE IN RIVERSIDE. OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO RESIDED IN RIVERSIDE WHO WAS ON THE APPS SYSTEM. SO WE WE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO GO. RETRIEVE WEAPONS WE FOUND OUT THAT THE WEAPONS THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL SAID -- THAT HE POSSESSED. HE SAID HAT THEY WERE NO LONGER IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE THEY WERE WITH -- RELATIVES OR FRIENDS SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S MIGHT WANT TO WORK WITH US. BUT THE MOMENT THEY HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE RIVERSIDE THEY LOSE ALL JURISDICTION. AND SO THEY COULD WORK THIS CASE THE WAY OUR OUR OUR AGE DID ALL THE WAY THROUGH BECAUSE IT TAKES WEEKS TO WORK THESE CASES. BUT THEY HAVE TO STOP AT THE BORDER. AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO OVER CRISIS TO GET -- GET THOSE WEAPONS. WE DON'T HAVE THAT WORRY WE CAN'T BUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS NOT TRY TO DO ALL THE WORK THAT RIVERSIDE OR LA COUNTY WOULD WANT TO DO FOR US WITH US. WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS? HAVE A NETWORK THAT WORKS TOGETHER SO IF RIVERSIDE IS GONNA DO SOME OF THE APPS RETRIEVAL. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE. TO GET SOMEONE WHO'S NOW CHRISTER COUNTY BORDER. THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THROUGH ARE WORKING WITH THEM TASK FORCES FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT THERE'S NO DELAY. WE HAD A SITUATION UP IN THE BAY AREA WHERE AGAIN THE INDIVIDUAL WEEK WE HAD THE INDIVIDUAL MAKE CONTACT THE INDIVIDUAL SAID THE WEAPONS WITH MY SISTER WHERE'S YOUR SISTER. IN ANOTHER CITY WAS IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ARRANGEMENT WE HAD A WAIT. TELL OUR AGENTS DROVE ALL THE WAY IN THE BAY AREA WITH TRAFFIC TO GO TO THAT CITY THE GOAL LOCATE THE SISTERTO SEE IF WE GET THE WEAPON. AND AND SO. IT IF WE COULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY WHERE THAT. SISTER WAS LOCATED SAY CAN YOU SEND SOME OFFICERS OUT THERE. AT THAT POINT I THINK IT'S LEGITIMATE FOR THAT AGE TO SAY WE WANT THAT RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THAT WEAPON. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT PULL OUR OFFICERS WERERIGHT NOW DOING PATROLLING TO GET THAT WEAPON IT'S GOING TO MOVE THE BOY FROM SOME OF THE OTHER WORK SO I THINK LEGITIMATELY THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY. THIS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME. RESOURCES FOR US TO DO IT AS WELL OTHERWISE HE BE DOING IT RIGHT NOW. MORE IT'S JUST THAT IT IS RESOURCES AND WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM AND I THINK I MENTIONED JUSTICE CENTER MORE OUT PREVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CREATING THAT NETWORK. WHICH DOESN'T COST MONEY. IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION WHERE SOME OF THESE AGENCIES WILL SAY NOW WE'RE GETTING UP REALLY AGGRESSIVELY INTO THIS WITH YOU WE'RE PULLING OUR OUR OFFICERS FROM WHAT THEY WERE DOING FORTY SOME OF THIS THAT'S COSTING US MONEY. AND TIME THERE'S WHERE I THINK IT'S A IT'S A FAIR -- A NOTION TO COME UP WITH RESOURCES FOR THE BUT THE THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS YEAR. IS NOT TO EXPAND TO DO IT OURSELVES IS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO. JUST TO CATCH UP WORK AND THEN HOPEFULLY DO A BETTER JOB OF TRYING TO COORDINATE WITH THOSE AGENCIES BECAUSE LA COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY WAS A WE CAN'T GO THERE ANYMORE. SO THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE TO TAKE OVER THE CASE WE CAN'T JUST DROP IT. AND SO IT'S IT'S A TIME INTENSIVE. LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS THE EARLIER WE DO IT AS CENTER MORE LIKE MISSION THE BETTER WE ARE. THE MORE WE CAN GET BY AND FOR THE AGENCIES NOT JUST BOB FORSMAN THE COURT. THE EASIER IT WILL BE TO RETRIEVE SOME OF THESE WEAPONS. TOMORROW IS THE CAN GET INTO A BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT IN A SECOND SO I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD. MOVE US TO THOSE BUT LET ME JUST BRING UP TO OTHER POINTS YOU RAISED -- THE FIVE YOUR WRIST DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE WHAT I FEEL IS VERY GOOD LITIGATION THAT YOU'RE PURSUING AROUND THE PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S OWN LAWS RELATIONSHIP TO A BACKSLIDING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN. ARM AND CLEARLY THERE IS -- YOU KNOW THAT TAKES RESOURCES BUT YOU ALSO IN IN REFERENCE THE RESOURCES FOR DEFENDING SOME OF OUR LAWS THAT ARE. ON IN OF THE GET CHALLENGED AND WE KNOW THAT. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR A LAW THAT WE PASSED TO GET CHALLENGED. ON AND IN SOME CASES WE SUCCEED N. MEANING THAT WE WENT IMPROVE IT WE PREVAIL IN COURT ARE LOCKET SO PELTON OTHER CASES NOT. I'M NOW THE THE DE SOME OF THOSE LAWSUITS AND AFFECT OUR ELECTIVE ON OUR PART. MEANING THE AG'S OFFICE BUT SOME ARE WE HAVE TO IN OTHER WORDS ONCE CALIFORNIA PASSES A LAW WE HAVE TO DEFEND IT. N. ON SO THERE ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT RESOURCES THAT COVER KIND OF BOTH -- BUT IF I TAKE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FOR EXAMPLE. BE. YOUR DECISION AND YOUR OFFICES DECISION TO NOT RELEASE RECORDS HAS NOW RESULTED. IN THE STATE BEING SUED. SO WE ARE NOW BEING SUED BECAUSE WE DID NOT UPHOLD OUR OWN LOT. NOW YOU DESCRIBED THAT. YOUR SENSE WAS THAT GIVEN THAT. THERE WAS -- THE LAW UNTIL SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CHANGED IT. THESE INVESTIGATORY RECORDS WERE NOT. ALLOWED TO BE PUBLIC. AND ONCE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PASSED AND WENT INTO EFFECT. THESE RECORDS WERE ALLOWED TO BE MADE PUBLIC. AND THERE WERE SOME COURTS THAT PUTS STAYS. NOW IN THE THERE ARE SOME COURTS TO PUT IN STAYS BUT EVERY COURT. THAT IS HELD A HEARING. ON THE BILL. HAS UPHELD THE BILL. AS WAS INTENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH THE TERM RETROACTIVE IT'S NOT ANY MATERIAL TERM HERE. BECAUSE RETROACTIVE WOULD BE. IF I REQUESTED RECORDS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN THE LAW IS NOT IN EFFECT IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT THE ISSUE OF WHAT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE TO ME. BECAUSE THE LAW WAS A AMENDED THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN BECAUSE THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. DEALS WITH RECORDS. RECORDS THAT AARON AND AGENCIES POSSESSION. SO WITH. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AGAIN. RECORDS THAT ARE IN THE AGENCIES POSSESSION AS OF THE POINT THAT THE LAWS IN EFFECT OR THAN AVAILABLE NOW EVERY COURT SO FAR HAS APPEALED THAT WHO HAD A ROOT WHO ACTUALLY HELD HEARINGS. FURTHER ON MARCH. TWENTY NINE APPEALS COURT STATE APPEALS COURT. ISSUE A STATEWIDE RULING AND IN THEIR OWN. THEY INDICATED THAT THIS RULING. TAKES EFFECT STATEWIDE. UNTIL A DIFFERENT COURT OF APPEALS. IF ONE DOES ACCESS TO OVERTURN THAT. SO WE NOW HAVE. A MARCH TWENTY NINTH RULING BY AN APPEALS COURT. YES YOUR OWN OFFICE ISSUED A LETTER ON APRIL SECOND. INDICATING YOU'RE STILL. HOLDING RECORDS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE RELEASING RECORDS. SO UNDER WHAT SCENARIO. GIVEN THAT WE NOW HAVE A COURT RULING ON THIS. DO YOU GET A GREEN LIGHT. THE BELL CURVE -- UNLESS YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT A CASE I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WHERE THE APPELLATE COURT ISSUED A RULING THAT WAS A RULING. THAT WAS BASED ON A PETITION FOR A RE SENSUALLY A STAY. IT WAS IN A AGAIN UNLESS THIS IS A DIFFERENT CASE THIS IS THE FIRST APPELLATE COURT -- AND IT WAS A DECISION. THAT WAS RENDERED ON WHETHER OR NOT THERE SHOULD BE A STATE. OF THE TRIAL COURT THE LOWER COURT COURT ACTIONS. IT WAS IN AND A RULING ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. IT RULED THAT THE SUPPLIES STATEWIDE. AND THAT THE RECORDS WERE THAT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE APPLY TO REORDS IN IN AGENCIES POSSESSION. AS A AS I SAID F IT MAYBE THAT'S A DECISION THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH BUT IF IT'S THE DECISION THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING. TO AND THE FIRST BILL COURT. THEN IT IS NOT A RULING ON THE MERITS IT WAS A PETITION THAT WAS FILED -- BY ONE OF THE PARTIES TO STAY THE LOWER COURT ACTION. AND THE THE RULING IS ON WHETHER OR NOT. OR IT SHOULD STAY THE LOWER COURT ACTION YES AND THE LOWER COURTS ACTION WAS ON THE MERITS SO IN OTHER WORDS EVERY COURT THAT IS HEARD IT ON THE MERITS HAS RULED THAT THEIR RECORDS CAN BE RELEASED. AND SO THE APPELLATE COURT JUST UP HELD THAT. BRITISH ON THIS DAY ISSUE BUT IT DID NOT RULE ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE IT MADE A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT DOESN'T GO TO THE TO THE NEED -- TO TO MAKE A DECISION ON THE ON THE PETITION FOR THIS DAY BUT WHAT IT DID MAKE AS I SAID IN MY OWN -- REMARKS IS THAT IT MADE A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT ABOUT WHERE IT WAS HEADING. I GET THAT. AND SOON I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A DECISION ON THE MERITS THAT WE CAN RELY ON BECAUSE THAT QUIRK FUNDS AND WHAT COURT. SORRY THERE IS COURT THAT'S IN COURT IS GOING TO HEAR THE CASE. THE AGAIN THE RULING BY THE COURT DOESN'T DISPOSE OF THE ISSUE. THE RULING THAT THE COURT ISSUED SIMPLY SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN FORSMAN. WHILE WE GET READY TO LISTEN TO THE CASE. SO IT WAS NOT A RULING ON THE CASE ITSELF ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE IT WAS A RULING ON A PETITION BY ONE OF THE PARTIES A WHERE IT WHILE WE'RE GOING TO WHERE YOU CAN REVIEW THIS. PUT A HOLD ON EVERYTHING THE COURT SAID OF THE VIDEO SO THE DIFFICULTY I'M HAVING IS THAT. AS THE PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IN AFFECTING FORCING THE LOS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PRESIDENT'S IN PREVIOUS IN ALL PREVIOUS COURT RULING TO NOT TO DO WITH JUST FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BUT IN GENERAL AROUND THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS. IS AN FIVE I DON'T HAVE -- RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THESE COUPLE OF CASES THAT I'M GONNA RIP REFERENCE BUT I DID IN IT INDEPENDENT -- COMMUNICATION TO CITE THEM [inaudible] THAT. EIGHT LOCALITIES WHOEVER THAT ONE CANNOT OPT NOT TO FOLLOW A LAW THAT WAS ENACTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ASSUMING THAT. THE LAW IS GOING TO BE. THEN REVERSED BY THE COURT SO IN OTHER WORDS THE THERE ARE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT RULINGS THAT BASICALLY SAY ONCE THE LAWS ENACTED. EVEN IF SOMEONE SUSPECTS THAT IT MIGHT BE OVERTURNED THAT UNTIL THE COURT ACTS TO OVERTURN IT. AT A LOSS TO BE RESPECTED ENOUGH FELT. SO. THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE NOT YET HAD ANY COURT ON THE MERITS. REVERSE THE LOCK. SO THE LAW IS IN PLACE IT WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND SO I GUESS FOR ME THE TROUBLE IS AS OUR ENFORCER OF OUR STATE LAWS. WHY IS IT THAT? YOU ARE NOT HONORING THAT LAW. LET ME USE YOUR FRAMING OF OF THE MATTER AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL EXPLAIN. IF THIS WERE A CASE WHERE IT WAS SIMPLY A MATTER OF INTERPRETING. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE THIS NEW LAW AND WHAT WE DO WITH REGARD TO RECORDS. THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE NOT DISCLOSED. UNDER A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. I COULD UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN YOU RAISE ABOUT THE THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF WHAT WE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE NEW STATUTES. AND HOW YOU SHOULD INTERPRET AND YOU SHOULD WAIT FOR COURT TO MAKE A DECISION. BUT AS YOU SAID ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MY JOB IS TO ENFORCE IN A POLL TO LAWS. THERE IS A PARTY THERE WERE PARTICULAR WHAT'S. THAT WERE IN THE BOOKS EXISTING BEFORE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE BECAME LAW THAT PROTECTED. PRIVATE INFORMATION OF OFFICERS. THAT EXISTED IN LAW FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THERE IS NO RULING IN ANY COURT SAYING THAT THAT LAW IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT NO BUT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE REVERSE THOSE WERE THAT WAS AS YOU POINTED OUT A LAW THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUT SO THAT STATUTE OF PROTECTION. WAS PUT IN EFFECT BY THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE THEN REVERSED THAT STATUTE. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT YOUR THAT. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE CHANGE THE THE TYPES OF DOCUMENTS AT A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. REACH. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING IN YOUR BILL THAT PASSED THAT. AS EXPRESSLY. AND DID THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT ALONG FORSMAN OFFICERS HAVE HAD. AND SO WHAT I SAID. IN TRYING TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR THOSE PUBLIC RECORDS THAT-PRE DATED JANUARY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN IS. THERE IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE YOU HAVE EXISTING LAWS THAT PROTECT. THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THAT -- FORTY TWENTY ONE THOSE WHO -- OURS IS THE PROPONENTS YOU YOU AND OTHERS HAVE SAID AND DID THOSE [inaudible] PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. MY SENSES AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE STATEMENT BY THAT APPELLATE COURT RECENTLY THAT THAT'S WHERE THE COURTS WILL GO. BUT I CAN'T GO BASED ON WHAT WE THINK THE COURTS MAY DO ONCE I PROVIDE DOES PRIVACY RECORDS OF THOSE. POLICE OFFICERS. CAN'T PULL THEM BACK IF THE COURT SHOULD ULTIMATELY END UP RULING. NO THOSE ARE STILL PROTECTED BECAUSE FOURTEEN TO TWENTY ONE DIDN'T EXPRESSLY -- REPEAL THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE IF I COULD IF YOU GIVE ME ONE ONE MINUTE THE ME EXPLAIN SO WHAT THE POSITION I'VE TAKEN. I AM RIGHT OW BEING SUED BY THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. BECAUSE THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WANTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO RECORDS PHARMACEUTICAL RECORDS PER PRESCRIPTION RECORDS OF CALIFORNIANS. UNDER OUR CURE SYSTEM ARCHERS DATABASE WHERE WE KEEP FOLLOWS PRESCRIPTION RECORDS OF CALIFORNIANS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY WANT THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SOME INVESTIGATIONS. WE WANT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THOSE RECORDS. THEY ARE TRYING TO SECURE THOSE RECORDS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED AN ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA WHICH IS SHORT OF A WARRANT. WE'VE GOING FOR JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE TO GET A WARRANT. TO GET ACCESS TO PRIVATE INFORMATION IN OUR CURES DATABASE OF CALIFORNIANS PRESCRIPTION ACTIVITIES. WE ASK D. E. A.. TO TO PROVIDE US WITH THE THE DETAILS OF WHAT THEY WERE PLANNING TO USE THOSE RECORDS THAT THEY WERE GONNA ACCESS OF CALIFORNIANS. FOR AND TO COMMIT THAT THEY WOULD USE IT ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE. IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. D. A. SAID NO WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO GET THOSE RECORDS TO OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA. I SAID YOU MIGHT BUT THERE'S A COURT A FEDERAL COURT RULING. THAT SAYS THAT PRIVATE INFORMATION CAN I JUST BE SECURED. AT WILL AND SO WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT WE EVEN THOUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE -- PRIMACY IN THESE MATTERS THAT UNTIL COR TELLS BE THAT I HAVE TO LET GO OF A CALIFORNIANS. PRIVATE. PRESCRIPTION DRUG INFORMATION THAT I'M NOT GOING TO RELEASE IT TO BECAUSE SOMEONE SAYS THAT. IT'S OKAY AND SO. IN THE IN THIS SENSE OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OR IN THE CASE OF THE D. E. A. REQUESTED -- PRESCRIPTION DRUG RECORDS. IF I'M TOLD BY QUIRK. THAT I MUST RELEASED I WILL BUT UNTIL THEN I WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AS BEST I CAN MISTER MISTER. I WILL AT IT IS AN INTERESTING ANALOGY BUT IT IS -- NOT EVEN APPLES TO ORANGES I WOULD CALL IT APPLES TO A PIECE OF STEAK. AND THE REASON IS YOU ARE REFERENCING WHAT A FEDERAL AGENCY WANTS FROM YOU THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IN DEFIANCE OF CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. WHAT I AM REFERENCING IS A? CALIFORNIA STATE LAW WELL YOU FIFTY CURES YOU SAID IS PRIVATE. SO THERE'S BEEN NO ACTION THAT I'M AWARE OF BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THAT WOULD SAY TO YOU. RELEASE THOSE RECORDS TO THAT THE D. E. A. ONCE. THERE HAS BEEN AN ACTION BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR AND UP HELD BY THE APPELLATE COURT. TO MAKE A CERTAIN AND LIMITED SET OF INVESTIGATORY RECORDS NOW PUBLIC. SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. TO SET IN THIS SEAT. AND HAVE THAT ANALOGY BE MADE AS TO WHY THAT IS SOMEHOW SIMILAR TO YOUR DE A CASE. BUT SECONDARILY IT RACES. WELL I DON'T HAVE A PARTICULAR OTHER LAW THAT I CAN BRING UP RIGHT NOW BUT I'M SURE IN A HALF AN HOUR OR SO ONE WILL COME TO ME. THAT IT'S RATE LIKE AN ELECTIVE DECISION AS TO WHICH OF OUR LARGE WILL ENFORCE IN WHICH YOU WANT SO I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE OTHER PRIVACY LAWS. OR LAWS RELATING TO SOME ASPECT OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED TO BE A PREVIOUSLY PROTECTED PRIVACY RIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CHANGED. FOR WHICH I AM NOT AWARE THAT THE AG'S OFFICE THAN DID NOT ENFORCE. SO I IT. IS A I THINK THAT -- I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE AGENCY HAS PUT ITSELF IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION IN RELATIONSHIP TO BEING THE ENTITY THAT UP HOLD CALIFORNIA STATE LAWS AND YET IN THIS CASE HAS CHOSEN. NOT TO FOLLOW. THE LAW. VENTURE AYE AYE I RESPECT THE POSITION TAKEN I APPRECIATED THAT AND I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL APPRECIATE THE POSITION I'M IN IN TRYING TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS THERE WERE OTHER LAWS IN EFFECT BEFORE. FORTY TWENTY ONE THAT PROTECTED THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS INFORMATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THOSE ARE NOT IN AYE ABLE NOT DENIABLE BUT MOST EVERY LAW WE ENACT. NOT ALL BUT MOST EVERYONE WE ENACT. ON DOES. A PREVIOUS STATUTES SO WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW -- WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT IN A SEPARATE. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION DISCUSSION ON ANY OTHER OVERVIEW COMMENTS FOR GET INTO OUR ITEMS KNOWN. I'M GLAD THE DISCUSSION OF THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER IS OVER WITH WITH YOU -- I WOULD CHOOSE I HOPE THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. I'M JUST ON ACTUALLY CENTER IT'S ALMOST IT IN MANY WAYS -- THERE'S A SIMILARITY IN THAT -- THAT'S WHY I'M RISEN IS YEAH. YEAH. MY JOB IS TO BE I'M LEARNING THE NATURE OF YOU. AND IT'S A DELL PC VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION YOU'RE LEARNING THE NATURE MADE THOUGH. THE DIP THE DIFFICULTY FOR ME IS THAT. ONCE YOU [inaudible] GIVEAWAY. CERTAIN RIGHTS IN THIS CASE PRIVACY OF YOU JUST KEPT PULLING BACK AND SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A MOVE WE MAKE A MOVE. LIKE THAT IS THE LEGISLATURE'S PROACTIVE IT IS BACK BENCHER AND THAT'S WHY AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THESE COURTS RULE WE WILL BE READY TO DO WHATEVER THE COURTS TELL US. AND WE DON'T MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT. A GIVEN THAT THIS IS A BUDGET HEARING MY ONLY LAST COMMENT ABOUT THAT WOULD BE THE FACT THAT. PART AS YOU RACE AND YOU WERE THE PERSON THAT RACE THIS THAT HE'S VERY SCORE CASES TAKE RESOURCES AND SO THE COURT CASES THAT ARE NOW SUING YOU ON THIS QUESTION ARE ONES THAT YOU ELECTED. TO HAVE TO MAKE US VULNERABLE TO AND YOU WILL HAVE TO USE RESOURCES TO DEFEND IT. WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THE OPTION TO ABOUT FELT THE LAW? I I APPRECIATE WE'RE SAYING I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE GET A CLARIFICATION FROM THE COURTS AND I THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY. PEOPLE'S PRIVACY IS CRITICAL AND IF I'M GONNA DISCLOSE PEOPLE'S PRIVATE INFORMATION ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT A PROFESSION THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD THAT PROTECTION. I'M GONNA MAKE SURE I DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO -- TO THE DISCUSSION ITEMS. AND I MEAN WE ALREADY HAD YOUR UPDATE THANK YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO GET INTO THE APPS. AND THE I'M SURE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE'VE ALREADY RAISED. WE WON'T HAVE TO REPEAT -- AND CERTAINLY IN THE PRESENTATION NOW ANYTHING THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY RAISED WOULD APPRECIATE ALSO IF WE DON'T REPEAT JUST SO THAT. ALL OF US KNOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND WE CAN USE OUR TIME. JEFF IT'S OKAY WITH RIGHT YOU IN THE COMMITTEE I WILL STAY AS LONG AS I CAN BUT OBVIOUSLY I'VE GOT THE EXPERTS HERE. OKAY EXCELLENT SO. THIS IS THE BUREAU FARMS WORKLOAD AND APPS -- INVESTIGATIONS GO AHEAD THE BCP'S RELATED TO IT. MENTOR CHRIS RYAN THE CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OPERATIONS AND THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST. FORTY THREE POSITIONS AND SIX POINT NINE MILLION IN FUNDING IN NINETEN TWENTY AND SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING IN THE DEALER'S RECORD OF SALE. A SPECIAL ACCOUNT FUNDING THE REQUESTED FUNDING WILL SUPPORT NINETEEN NEW POSITIONS TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS CURRENTLY. WORKING IN THE BLANKET AND TWENTY POSITIONS WITH LIMITED TERM FUNDING. THE POSITION OF AUTHORITY IS EXPIRED SO IT'S A IT'S A COMBINATION OF ISSUES -- GOING ON HERE THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS A PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU'S CRITICAL TIME SENSITIVE REGULATORY WORKLOAD WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE TEMPORARILY ABSORBED. AND MARTIN WHO RAN THE DIRECTOR IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES WE HAVE ASKED SOME ARE THERE ADDITIONAL ONES I GUESS THE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK BUT IS GIVEN THAT. SOME OF THIS IS -- RELATED TO THE DROSS. COUNTING FUNDS WE HAVE FROM DROST. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE AGENCY HAS THE AUTHORITY. TO ADDRESS THE DROSS FEE BASED ON INFLATION. AND I DON'T SEE THAT THE AGENCY HAS PUT FORWARD ANY RECORD ANY MOTION TO DO SO WE DON'T YOU DON'T EVEN NEED OUR APPROVAL FOR THAT. BUT WHAT I DO SEE IS A REQUEST FOR GENERAL FUND THAT MIGHT. AT SOME LEVEL OF IT MIGHT BE COVERED IF THE FEE WERE ADJUSTED TO COVER THE AND WHAT'S AT THE INFLATION SINCE THE LAST TIME. THE MANAGER THERE IS CURRENT AUTHORITY TO ADJUST THE FEE -- RELATED TO THE DRESS FUND IN THE GAS PROGRAM HOWEVER THE PROPOSAL FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO REQUEST RELATES TO THE APPS PROGRAM. AND SO THE THE PROPOSAL WOULD FIND THAT THERE IS IT AFTER PROPOSAL -- THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND. RATHER THAN USING THE FEE SOURCE FROM THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE FIND. THAT THAT'S THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE WHY YOU'RE SEEING -- GENERAL FUND ASK AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER FUND -- FOR THE THE THE PRIMARY ADDRESS -- FOR ACTIVITIES IS READY TO SCRIBES THAT THERE IS OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL OF GROSS AND NET IT ALSO DESCRIBES TRYING TO MAKE UP SOME GENERAL FUND FOR THAT OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL. SO WHAT I'M RAISING IS. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE SHORTFALL WOULD BE ONCE THE FEE WAS ADJUSTED. DUE TO A BASED ON THE AUTHORITY YOU HALF. OVER TO DO A FEE INCREASE. THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS -- WE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE IT I BELIEVE IT'S SIX DOLLARS RIGHT NOW SIX OR SEVEN DOLLARS TO KEEP UP. I'M NOT ASKING THAT I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO ADJUST THE FEE BASED ON THE INFLATIONARY. AND IT WOULD IT MIGHT NOT GIVE YOU THE FULL RECOVERY BUT IT. AND I DON'T I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WHAT THAT. MIGHT PROVIDE YOU IN TERMS OF REVENUE BUT IT WOULD GIVE ME THEN A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THAT. REVENUE. AND WHAT GENERAL FUND BACKFILL WE MAY NEED. SO. I'M JUST I UNDERSTAND AND AND I RELATES PRIMARILY TO THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT OUR APPS PROGRAM RELATED. THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIFFERENCE IN THE MATERIALS I HALF BUT THAT'S OKAY BUT I THINK A WOULD BE. USE FOR AT LEAST. THIS COMMITTEE WOULD APPRECIATE. I'M GETTING SOME ESTIMATE OF WHAT REVENUE THE DROSS ACCOUNT WOULD RECEIVE. IF THE FIGHT FEE WAS ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. OKAY AND WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF TO GET THAT GREAT. GREAT CENTER MOORLACH -- I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW YOU INTEND TO HIRE THE TWENTY SIX POSITIONS. SB ELEVEN YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MARTIN RAN DIRECTOR OF GIRL FARMS. SO ARE HIRING METHODOLOGIES HAVE CONTINUED -- AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST AND WE WOULD CONTINUE WERE WERE HOPING FOR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS IMPROVED -- PAY PACKAGES THAT WILL FURTHER ALLOW US TO BETTER RECRUIT AND RETAIN INDIVIDUALS -- BUT EVEN IF THAT. DOES NOT HAPPEN WE ARE DOING OUR BEST. TO ADVERTISE AND AND AND DO EXAMINATIONS FOUR TIMES A YEAR WE'RE JUST HAVING A LOT OF DIFFICULTY NOWADAYS BECAUSE OF OUR OUR PAY LEVELS HAD STAYED RELATIVELY -- STAGNANT FOR SOLAR YEARS WIPING A LOT OF AGENCIES HAVE GRADUALLY INCREASED. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WITH THE PENSION SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS WE WOULD NORMALLY ON A REGULAR BASIS RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. BUT BAY ARE GRANDFATHERED IN TO THE PREVIOUS PENSION SYSTEM SO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO LEAVE AND COME TO THE STATE -- THEY WOULD NOW COME INTO THE NEW LOWER TIER. SO -- THAT ALSO MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US -- TO RECRUIT AND AND HIGHER INDIVIDUALS WE'RE STILL PROGRESSING DOWN THAT PATH IT'S JUST A MUCH. SLOWER PROCESS AND THERE'S FEWER INDIVIDUALS -- TO EXAMINED DURING THE TESTING AND SELECTION PROCESS. WHICH IS ALL ALREADY VERY DIFFICULT SO THE THE FAILURE RATE BASED ON EXAMINATIONS -- POLYGRAPH MEDICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL THERE'S THERE'S A HIGH -- DROP OUT RATE DURING THAT PROCESS MANY YEARS AGO WE HAD. UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WOULD TAKE THE EXAMINATION. WHEN THEY WERE OFFERED -- NOWADAYS IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR PROCESS TO RECRUIT -- AND GET OUT AND EXPRESS FURTHER WHAT W DO HOW WE DO IT HOW WE CAN HELP LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND TRY TO RECRUIT FOLKS OVER IT JUST MAKES IT MUCH MORE. DIFFICULT GIVEN THE CURRENT -- SALARY DISPARITY THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IS IT CONSIDERED AN ENTRY LEVEL POSITION. WELL WE HAVE TWO POSITIONS -- THAT WE WOULD BRING IN AS ENTRY LEVEL ONE WOULD BE -- AN EXPERIENCED LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATOR COULD LATERAL INTO OUR AGENCY. THE OTHER WHICH IS MORE OF THE ENTRY LEVEL POSITION THAT WE WOULD COMPETE WITH WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD BE SOMEBODY WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WITH NO LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERIENCE. WE CAN BRING THEM ON AND SEND THEM TO THROUGH A FULL POLICE ACADEMY. AND START THEM IN THE PROCESS AS AN INVESTIGATOR THROUGH THAT ROUTE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS OUR ENTRY LOWEST LEVEL POSITION AND IT PAYS FAR LESS THAN -- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS. THANK YOU MAKE MANAGER THE IT DOES SEEM WHEN WE LOOK AT THEM MATERIALS THAT THE WHILE THE BUDGET WELL THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A BUDGET THAT DID. INCREASE FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF APPS ENFORCEMENT AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS. AS YOU'VE STATED YOU WERE ABLE. TO RETAIN OR YOU DIDN'T ACHIEVE THAT NUMBER OF POSITIONS SO. I GUESS THE WHAT. WHAT PART OF OUR QUESTION IS TRYING TO GET AT IS IF IT REALLY IS A PROBLEM OF THE? SALARY -- THE STATE WIDE -- I FORGET WHAT THE WORD IS CAUGHT WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE SETTING OF THE SALARY THAT ON THE STATE LIST. WHAT IT SET AT [inaudible] IS. ONE I GUESS WHY ISN'T THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TALKING IN ADMINISTRATION ABOUT AN APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS. BECAUSE YEAH CLASSIFICATION AFTERWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU CLASSIFICATION THANK YOU -- CLASSIFICATION RIGHT BECAUSE WE END UP. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THEY DON'T GET FILLED. BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY EACH YEAR AS WE LOOK AT ALL RIGHT THERE STORY -- ACT LIKE THEY'RE STILL WORKLOAD SO WHEN WE HAD MORE POSITIONS BUT IT'S LIKE WE'RE ADDING POSITIONS ON TOP OF POSITIONS BUT POSITIONS ARE AN EVEN FELT SO WE DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW. IF THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS WERE ADDING. ARE EITHER TOO MANY OR INADEQUATE OR ADEQUATE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE THEM FULLY STAFFED YET FOR US TO MAKE ANY OF THAT KIND OF DETERMINATION SO IF THE PROBLEM IS THAT CLASSIFICATION. A MENTOR YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE ESSENTIALLY REPEAT WHAT I'VE SAID TO MY TEAM AND WE SAID TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND THAT IS. IS THERE SOME WAY FOR US TO WORKING WITHIN THE REGIME WE HAVE AND PART OF IT IS SOMETHING. WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT DIRECTLY CAUSE IS THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS IS YOUR LAST VACATION IS AND YOU CAN GET THE CLASSIFICATIONS CAN'T GET ADJUSTED BY AND AND AND SO WE BASS IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE COULD. CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATIONS FOR THESE POSITIONS SO THEY COULD BE AT A HIGHER LEVEL SO THAT WE WE COULD COMPETE. FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO COME AND WORK WITH US BUT IF THEY'RE AT THOSE LOWER CATEGORIES IT DOES MAKE IT DIFFICULT THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR US IF YOU'RE GOING BACK TO THAT. TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN PERIOD WHEN. APARTMENT JUST GOT A A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE APPS PROGRAM IS THAT IF YOU LOOK CLOSE YOU'LL FIND THAT MANY OF THOSE POSITIONS THAT WE WERE PROVIDED. WE'RE LIMITED TERM AND SO IF IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE BASED ON COMPENSATION WAGES AND GO AND PENSION AND BENEFITS. IT WAS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU COULD DO WE COULD TELL UP AND BY THE WAY WE CAN ONLY GIVE YOU THIS POSITION FOR A YEAR SO. AND SO IT MADE IT REALLY TOUGH TO HIRE PEOPLE ON IT THAT'S WHY HAVING PERMANENT POSITIONS MAKES IT EASIER FOR US TO BRING FOLKS SAID. BECAUSE NO ONE'S GOING TO LEAVE A JOB THAT PAYS MORE GIVES A BETTER PENSION BENEFITS. TO KNOW THAT THEIR ONLY GET TO DO FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME. RIGHT SO. I AM BUT I DON'T WANT TO SOUND CONTRADICTORY THAT I'M IN FAVOR OF INCREASING GENERAL FUND AT AT ALLOCATION HEARING YET I THINK THAT HE IF WE HAD A BETTER HANDLE ON WHAT IS THE RIGHT CLASSIFICATION SALARY TO RETAIN THE POSITIONS. WE MIGHT THEN WHILE WE MIGHT SEE AN INCREASE INITIALLY WE MIGHT END UP. NOT HAVING AS MUCH. THE SAME NUMBER OF FTP NEED OVER TIME TO MEET THE WORKLOAD BECAUSE THE F. T. E. WILL. BE FELT WHICH IS THE SITUATION WE'RE IN NOW IS IT'S NOT EVEN FILLED SO IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO DETERMINE WHAT THE REAL. WORK LOAD IS THE STAFF LEVEL OUTPUT FOR THE WORKPLACE IN STATE WE HAVEN'T EVEN FOR SHORT GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. IN ADDITION TO THE BC PLEASE YOUR HAVE SUBMITTED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THE MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE A A FACTOR IN INFLUENCE ON EITHER THE WAY WE MIGHT UTILIZE. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASSIST US IN THIS PROCESS OR OTHER ASPECTS THAT MAY INFORMED THAN WHAT WE DO. FINALLY ON THIS BUDGET. ANY OTHER. OKAY CENTER ABOUT JUST -- I'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE LONGER SO I'VE. AT A CENTER HANCOCK WAS A TEACHER AND I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE -- AT THAT POINT SO I'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE LONGEST. AND WE'VE HEARD THIS OVER AND OVER HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. GIVE US THIS MONEY AND AND HERE'S OUR PLAN AND THEN WE DON'T HIRE THE STAFF AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND SAY WELL HERE'S HERE'S OUR PLAN NOW -- WE WANT TO DO THIS AND AND WILL REDUCE THE BACKLOG AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS KIND OF LIKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT THE END. OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF VACANCIES BECAUSE WE CAN'T HIRE THE SAME THING WITH YOUR YEAR IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME THING WHAT [inaudible] I PERCY I PERCEIVE THE MODEL YOU USE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK. IS NOT THE RIGHT MODEL. YOU HAVE TO REINVENT YOUR MODEL LOOK AT MAYBE SOME OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF GUNS ARE OUT THERE MAYBE -- TECHNOLOGY TEAM. OF YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE SOME REINVENTION OF SOME NEW. MODEL TO SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM I'D BE HAPPY TO TO SUPPORT. IF YOU HAD A DIFFERENT DIRECTION I THINK THE SAME DIRECTION I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT I MEAN I CAN'T. JUST EVERY YEAR UNTIL I LEAVE YOUR DO THE SAME THING I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF NOT. APPROPRIATE I THINK. OF THIS ISN'T WORKING SO SO YOU'RE. EVERY YEAR THERE'S YOU KNOW THE SAME NUMBER YOU HAVE X. AMOUNT COMING IN X. AMOUNT GOING OUT YOU KNOW. YEAH -- THE PROHIBITED LIST OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME VERY BASIC WAY OF OF RUNNING THAT BETTER. YOU KNOW MAYBE START IN THE BEGINNING WHERE THEY FIRST GET ON THERE FOR HIM LISTEN GO BACK FURTHER. TRY TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING ON THE LIST A REDUCING. THOSE PEOPLE THERE'S OTHER. I. T. WAYS OF DOING IT I THINK SO IT I I THINK. I THINK YOU'RE IN MAYBE MAYBE YOU HAVE THE WRONG GROUP OF STAFF MAYBE YOU IN THE PEOPLE THAT CAN ASSIST YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE MORE MAYBE A OF THE LOWER LEVELS THE TECH TEAM. THAT DOES THE ASSISTANT OR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT I AM I AM CONVINCED THAT. WE NEED TO REINVENT THIS. PROCESS IN YOUR TEAM TO MAKE IT WORK EFFECTIVELY. OF THE WEATHER REASONS WHY IS YOU KNOW WE YOU KNOW SO SOMEBODY GETS ON THE LIST AND THEN THERE'S TOO MUCH TIME. BEFORE THEIR CHECK IN GUNS ARE TAKEN AWAY IS JUST IS LIKE SELECT DMV. THE WATER REDUCE THE WAIT TIME YOU KNOW. SO SO YOU KNOW IT AND IF IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE DOESN'T WORK. IF -- WE HAVE TO KIND OF REINVENT THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TO HAVE A SO THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF -- IF IN THE MID. THE TIME IT TAKES. IF WE CAN HAVE SOME. IDEAS THAT COULD. WORK BETTER ON THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW BECAUSE I'M KIND OF HARD. PRESSED TO JUST THROW MORE MONEY AT IT I MEAN THAT'S I'M NOT I'M NOT. THAT'S DOES MARTIN IN A LONG TIME RIGHT THE SAME. JENNIFER COULD YES YOU MAY THANK YOU MANAGER. FIVE RESPOND -- WHAT YOU JUST SAID I ESSENTIALLY SAID ABOUT A YEAR AGO TO OUR TO THEIR TEAM I SAID? WE WE CAN'T EVEN. TALK ABOUT NUMBERS AND AND HAVE PEOPLE AGREE WITH WHAT OUR NUMBERS REFLECT. SO WE SORT OF STRIP EVERYTHING DOWN INSTEAD OF MORE LIKE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO TO GO THROUGH THIS WITH US WHEN WE ISSUED A REPORT. WE WENT THROUGH AND STRIPPED DOWN BECAUSE WHAT BACK WINNER BACKLOG CASES -- THERE WAS NEVER EVEN A DEFINITION OF WHAT WE CONSIDER THE BACKLOG AND SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS ONE WE TRY TO CLEAR THE DECKS AND MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WE'RE DOING. SO WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE VARIOUS PEOPLE WHO SIT IN THE APPS PROGRAM AND WHY. BUT TO YOUR POINT OF TRYING TO MAKE THIS WORK BETTER WE WE THINK WE IN THE PROCESS FIGURED OUT. WHAT WE SOME OF THESE WE NEED TO DO AT FIRST I THINK THE THE PERSONAL DOING A? PHENOMENAL -- THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GO OUT THERE NEVER ONCE IN THE TEN OR SO YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN OPERATING. HAS THERE BEEN AN INCIDENT AND MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND WEAPONS HAVE BEEN CONFISCATED NEVER ONCE HAS ANYONE GOT HURT. WE DON'T TYPICALLY GO IN WITH WARRANTS WE HAVE TO ASK. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET FOLKS TO HELP US AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL PROSECUTIONS LIKE THIS THE THE CASE IMAGINE AND ONLY COUNTY BUT AS I MENTIONED TO CENTER MORE. THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED CLEARLY THAT WE COULD DO RIGHT AWAY AND AND SOME OF IT WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOME A WE DON'T. WANT. THE COORDINATING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO IT ALL BY OURSELVES ENFORCEMENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO JUST LET US KNOW WHEN THEY FOR TWEET RETRIEVED A WEAPON RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING THAT OBLIGATES THEM TO LET US KNOW HEY WE PICKED UP THIS WEAPON. WE'RE WORKING THAT'S PERSON UP WE'RE DOING ALL THE WORK WE GET ME TO GO OUT THERE WE FIND OUT HEY I TURN THAT IN. A MONTH AGO. WHENEVER FORMED IS A WE DID ALL THIS WORK. TO FIND OUT THAT THE WEAPONS BEEN RETRIEVED IF WE CAN GET LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO NOTIFY US WHEN THEY RETRIEVE THE WEAPON. AND IN THREE AS WE SAID BEFORE. IS GETTING THE COURTS TO WORK WITH THIS ANDLOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY HAVE. ESSENTIALLY SAID. YOU'RE NOW DONE OR YOU BIãU BEEN PROSECUTED AND CONVICTED. AND WE KNOW YOU'VE GOT A WEAPON BECAUSE WE KNOW HAVE A WEAPON IF. WEEKS OF TURNER CONSERVE BODY TO YOUR POINT BEFORE WE LET THEM GO. GET IT NOW. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TELL THE COURTS OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS. AND THAT'S WHERE THE COOPERATION WOULD REALLY HAVE AS BEFORE MORE EFFICIENT AT THE FRONT END. IS THAT A TRIED TO DO IT SENATORS YOU MENTIONED AT THE BACK IN. THE JUDGE'S SO [inaudible] THANK. YOU KNOW I'VE RAISE THE DIE WAITED TO THE CHIEF. AND DOES SOME OF THE JUDGES AND IT'S MORE A MATTER I THINK OF HAVING THEM INCORPORATED WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THEY COULD BE IN SAY IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE MONEY FOR THEM TO DO THAT BUT WE JUST DID HAVE BETTER COURT COORDINATION. AND MAKING SURE. GOING WELL DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST FELONY THERE ARE SOME -- DANGEROUS MISDEMEANOR CONVICTIONS AS WELL AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOMEONE IS CONVICTED COULD BE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN -- ADJUDICATED BE DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES OR TO OTHERS OR SOMEONE WHO HAS -- OUTSTANDING. OUT. OF ORDERS -- RESTRAINING ORDERS AGAINST AND THAT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO GO IN THERE AND CONFISCATE THESE WEAPONS THERE'S FELONY CONVICTION -- AS AS A FAMILY CONDITION IS TO SEND SINCE IS BEING. THE THE OTHER CONVICTED AND THEN THERE'S A SENTENCING HEARING. BETWEEN THERE ARE. THEY SHOULD BE BEFORE THEIR SENTENCE. THAT COULD BE THE THE TIME YOU COULD ASK TO GET THE GUNS. BUT JUST YOUR TURN YOUR GUNS N.. IRAQ IN OUR LINGO IT ALL RIGHT IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THAT BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T THEN YOU GOT THE SENTENCING OR YOU CAN HOLD OVER. YOU GOT AWESOME DID YOU TURN ON YOUR CONCEPT [inaudible] DAHLE [inaudible] OKAY -- GO BACK TO JAIL WE'RE GOING TO WAIT TO DO THAT -- TO THEY WANT ALL THOSE GUNS TURNED ON BEFORE WE DO THE SENTENCE OR THE OR YOU CAN SAY WELL YOU TO AND YOU REFUSE TO COOPERATE. YOU KNOW. YOU DON'T HAVE REMORSE GUESS WHAT YOU KNOW TWO MORE YEARS. A HEARING -- YOU KNOW THERE'S WAYS YOU CAN. THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME. WHERE YOU COULD -- HAVE THE JUDGE. HELP WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND LAW ENFORCER AT THAT. TIME AND HIS FOLKS ARE UNDER PAROLE. THEY'RE HAVING TO REPORT THAT ARE PRO OFFICERS IF WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE WEAPONS YET. THEY ARE UNDER THAT JURISDICTION AND WE SHOULD BE A TO GET THE COOPERATION TO GET THE WATER OUT IN PAROLE THERE MANY WAYS A NEW SYSTEM. IT JUST THE COOPERATION THE COORDINATION. SO I KNOW. WATER IS WHENEVER TENER VOICES CORPORATION I THINK I YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA HAVE EVERYBODY DOING AT YOU KNOW CROSS TEAM COLLABORATION. ANYWAY SO IT'S CLEAR IT'S NOT ONLY THE MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE BUT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY MANY LEGISLATORS AND NIGHT -- THAT OBVIOUSLY THE FULL ENFORCEMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR APPS PROGRAM IS A PIE HIGH PRIORITY. AND SO THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN EVERY YEAR ATTEMPTS TO EITHER PROVIDE NEW RESOURCES ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT. AND STILL FEELING LIKE IT'S NOT YET ACHIEVED AND OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS BEEN NEW WORKLOAD THERE BEEN NEW LAWS THAT ADD. ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO THAT LIST BUT I THINK. WHAT -- AS WE HOLD THIS OPEN AND WE LOOK AT THE OTHER BILLSTHAT ARE GOING TO LEGISLATURE WHICH MAY AGAIN IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO TO DO THIS PERHAPS -- IN A BROADER MORE EFFECTIVELY HOWEVER. THEN WILL WE CAN CONSIDER THAT IN THE CONTEXT NOW OBVIOUSLY WILL PRY BE ADOPTING THE BUDGET PRIOR. TO THESE BILLS BEING SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BUT AT LEAST WE WOULD. THEY MIGHT INFORM. THE HOW WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND MANY MEN GERMAN EXCUSE MYSELF AT THIS STAGE BUT I THINK YOU AND MEMBERS FOR THE RIGHT PERHAPS RIGHT BEFORE YOU LEAVE SINCE WE ARE NOW MOVING -- TO AND WE ALREADY HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ON THIS BUT WE ARE MOVING TO ISSUE FIFTEEN WHICH IS THE SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE I YOU NEED TO STAY FOR THE WHOLE THING BECAUSE WE'VE HAD OBVIOUSLY BIG DISCUSSION BUT I WOULD SITE SINCE I HAVE THE FIRST PUBLIC COURT RULING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME. THAT FOR THE REASONS STATED THIS IS -- I AM NOW READING FROM THE RULING FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE TRIAL COURT APPELLANTS ARGUMENT IS WITHOUT MERIT. SO BASICALLY. THE INTEL THEY DID ROLL ON THE MERITS. AND I SAID IT IS WITHOUT MERIT AND DUST. WHILE THE RECORDS MAY HAVE BEEN CREATED PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN THE EVENT NECESSARY TO TRIGGER APPLICATION OF THE NEW LAW. A REQUEST FOR RECORDS MAINTAINED BY ANY AGENCY NECESSARILY OCCURS AFTER THE LOSS EFFECTIVE DATE. SO THE APPELLATE COURT RULING. A AGAIN MA'AM CHAIR AT I I UNDERSTAND I I KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF THE USE IT'S JUST THAT THAT WAS NOT A RULING ON THE MERITS THAT WAS A RULING ON THE PETITION FOR A STAY. I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE -- STINKS THAT BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY I WILL BE ABLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL LAWS THAT WERE ENACTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAD SOME IMPACT SOMEWHERE ON PRIVACY. FOR WHICH ENTITIES UP HELD. N. N. FOLLOWED AND PROBABLY HAD SUBSEQUENT COURTS. A RULE IN A WAY THAT EITHER LIMITED THEM WERE OVERTURNED THEM BUT NOTHING. BUT UNTIL THE COURTS FINALLY ACTED PREVENTED ANY ENTITY FROM. FOLLOWING THE LAW AS IT WAS PASSED BEFORE THE COURT BASICALLY RULED ON THE MERITS TO NOT UPHOLD THE LAW WHICH AS YOU INDICATE THERE'S NO COURT. YET THAT HAS RULED ON THE MERITS TO UPHOLD IT NO COURT HAS RULED YET TO NOT UPHOLD IT. I THINK WE HAVE PIZZA ARRIVING AT SEVEN MINUTES IF YOU WANT TO STAVING COULD SHARE PROVIDES LUNCH IF YOU WANT. A GRACIOUS IN THE HAVE A REQUEST -- FO SOME POSITIONS AND OF COURSE -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE NEEDING ANY POSITIONS RIGHT NOW GIVEN THAT. YOU'RE NOT RELEASING RECORDS BUT MAYBE YOU WILL SOON AND SO THEN YES MAYBE YOU DO NEED SOME NEW F. T. GO AHEAD. AND WITH THIS MY MY TEAM TAKE OVER FROM HERE MA'AM CHAIRED MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU FOR BEING. MADAM CHAIR CHRIS RYAN AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SO I REQUEST IS FOR THREE FOR THREE POSITIONS AND PRICING -- FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IN GENERAL FND TO PROCESS -- THE WORKLOAD THAT WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED WITH THIS BILL A SPECIFICALLY IT'S FOR INCREASED TO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE INCREASED PR A REQUEST -- RELEASE FOR PERSONAL RECORDS CONSISTING OF PERSONAL FILES RECORDS TRAINING RECORDS AND FILES AND THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS -- FILES AND RECORDS AS WELL I'M -- WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS BUT THEY ACTUALLY WERE ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR MANY MORE POSITIONS? IT WAS REYES THAT -- THE INITIAL REQUEST THAT ARE GETTING BEING RECEIVED NOW. COVER. ANY AND ALL RECORDS IN AGENCIES POSSESSION AND SO OF COURSE THE WORKLOAD RELATED TO THE INITIAL REQUEST IS GOING TO BE FAR HIGHER. BECAUSE ONCE THOSE RECORDS ARE RELEASED THEN THE ONLY RECORDS THAT WOULD PERTAIN ARE THOSE OFF COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS. AND THAT THAT WORK LOAD ONE WOULD AND COULD VERY WELL -- NO THAT WOULD BE LOWER -- SO WHERE DID YOU FACTOR IN. THE INITIAL LARGE WORKLOAD AND THEN THE FACT THAT THE WORKLOAD WOULD BE LOWERED IN TERMS OF THIS REQUEST. OUR ESTIMATE AND MARTY CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE REAL ASSUMED THE ON GOING NOT NECESSARILY THE THE BIG BANG AT THE BEGINNING BUT IT WAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED ON ON ANNOYS ONLY TO KEEP UP WITH THE THE REQUEST. OKAY. MANAGER DID INCLUDE THE ON GOING -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT CHRIS A STATED -- THE BUREAU FIREARMS -- SWORN PERSONNEL -- WEAR BODY CAMERAS ON EVERY ENFORCEMENT ACTION THEY'RE THE ONLY BUREAU THAT'S REQUIRED TO DO THAT SO EVERYTHING RELATED TO THESE RECORD REQUEST WILL ALSO TYING INTO. THE BODY FOOTAGE OF BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE. AND REVIEW AND REDACTION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT. AND IN ON ON OUR CASES IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY MAYBE PATROL YOU MIGHT HAVE ONE PERSON OR TWO PEOPLE AT AN INCIDENT OR SOMETHING OCCURS. WE TYPICALLY HAVE THREE TO SIX PEOPLE SO YOU HAVE CAMERAS ON EVERYBODY'S SOUL REQUIRE THE REVIEW OF ALL OF THOSE VIDEO FOOTAGE. ITEMS AND REDUCTION AND SO FORTH. THOUGH IT IS FOR A VERY LIMITED SET OF ITS ONLY COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS OF SUSTAINED. INCIDENTS OF TAMPERING WITH. EVIDENCE WITNESS INTERFERENCE. ON SEXUAL ASSAULT ON THE JOB. OR SO IN THOSE CASES. I WOULD IMAGINE AND AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW YET BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE RECORDS RELEASE BUT I WOULD. IMAGINE THAT THERE IS NOT THAT LARGE OF A NUMBER OF RECORDS WITHIN DO JEEZ DOJ'S POSITION RELATED TO THAT SORT OF THING. AND THE OTHER USE OF DEADLY FORCE. IS FORCE THAT MAY BE -- MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY LARGER AND THAT'S OF COURSE WHERE THE BODY CAM FOOTAGE WOULD CERTAINLY APPLY -- BUT AGAIN WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT RECORDS ARE YOU KNOW YOU MEAN YOUR POSSESSION DOUBT THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME SENSE THAT WOULD GIVE US AN INDICATOR OF WHAT MIGHT BE NORMAL ON GOING. SO IT'S HARD TO TO JUDGE. UNDERSTOOD AND AND AGAIN I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO GIVE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE GIVE RIGHT SPECIFIED AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORKLOAD WILL BE INITIALLY. AND NOT FALL BEHIND ON THE PROCESS OKAY OKAY. I DON'T THINK LA -- INTERVIEW ANY COMMENT ON THIS ONE NOW AND OKAY. GO AHEAD SENATOR ABOUT. SO ON THE BODY CAMERAS ARE GOING TO TREAT THOSE IS EVIDENCE OF SOME KIND OF EVIDENCE STANDARD. FOR THE BODY CAMERA MATERIAL. YES -- SO IT HAVE EVIDENCE OF RELATED STANDARD THAT'S SIMILAR OF CRIMINAL EVIDENCE. RIGHT YES OKAY AND THEN -- ENTERS A THE BUDGET -- OF IT IS SENDING WITH THING ANYWHERE I SERVE YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE FEES FOR THIS. BY GOV I MAKE A REQUEST IS THERE GOING TO BE. I I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH YOUR BILL. BUT ARE TEY ARE THEY PLANNING TO HAVE A CHARGE FEES OKAY AND YOU HAVE A OF EXPECTATION OF WHAT THE REVENUE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. THAT'S ON THIS PROPOSAL IT RELATES TO OUR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT YEAH. STAFF AND SO RIGHT YOUR YOU ARE ALLOWED THIS IS A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST TO AND YOU ARE ALLOWED TO CHARGE FEE BUT ONLY A FEW RELATED TO THE COST OF COPYING OF THE MATERIALS YEAH SO WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE SITUATION WITHOUT -- TYPICALLY WE DO CHARGE FOR PAPER -- FOR COPYING COSTS -- BUT THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF OTHER COSTS THAT TECHNO TECHNOLOGY COSTS -- THE EVIDENCE STANDARD YOU MENTIONED REQUIRES US TO SORT THINGS ELECTRONICALLY -- SO MOST OF THIS RELATES TO THOSE COSTS -- FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND THE TECHNOLOGY SO IF YOU HAVE A OF SO I COME IN I WANT SOMETHING. THEN YOU HAVE TO DO A LOT OF TECH WORK TO GIVE ME THAT STUFF SAVE NOW. COPIES OF THE VIDEO TAPES -- INTACT THE GUYS UP. TO DO SOME WORK TO PREPARE TO GIVE IT TO THE REQUEST FOR THIS REQUEST ARE GOING TO BE CHARGED A FEE FOR THAT ARE. ALSO DOING THAT OR REFILL OUR WE TYPICALLY CHARGE FOR THE SHIPPING COST WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY COVER ALL THE PERSONNEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ASSESS YOUR CHARGING A MUCH REVENUE YOU EXPECT FOR THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT CENTER BILL OR IT DON'T HAVE THAT IN FOR THOSE. SO THAT COULD BE PART OF THE BUDGET. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE. I WANT TO GET A CLEAR BECAUSE AN HONOR -- WHEN SHOULD IT BE IT'S WITH EXPLICIT? YOU MAKE A REQUEST ON THIS -- FOR GOING TO HAVE THE REVENUE WE SHOULD. WILL HOPEFULLY LIKE MOST EVERY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE STATE THE AGENT'S OFFICE WILL BE RELEASING RECORDS BEFORE WE ADOPT THE BUDGET SO THAT WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT REAL WORKLOAD MIGHT REQUIRE -- I A AIRED IN NOT ASKING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE APPS -- SO IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE APPS. AND MY APOLOGIES AND AND NOW IF THERE IS A PUBLIC COMMENT NOT. YES GO AHEAD VENTURES OKAY IF I COMMENT ON APPS YES YES I JUST WANTED TO ADD CLARIFICATION IF IF THERE WASN'T CLARIFICATION ON THE VACANCIES. IT'S NOT THAT BAD IS A STAGNANT NUMBER OF THE SAME VACANCIES IT'S A VERY FLUID PROCESS. FOR OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL THE HIRING PROCESS IS ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS LONG TO GO THROUGH A FULL. INVESTIGATION OF BACKGROUND BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS -- UNFORTUNATELY BUREAU FARMS WAS MORE LIKE A TRAINING GROUND WE WOULD HIRE PEOPLE. AND THEY WOULD MOVE ON EITHER EITHER TO ANOTHER LONG FIRST NATIONS SIR TO YOUR OWN RACK RIGHT THAT'S WHERE WE SAW MOSTLY RIGHT LOT OF YEAH SO BECAUSE WE ONLY HAD THE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS AS SOON AS THEY WERE ELIGIBLE THEY WOULD PUT ON THE TRANSFER LIST TO GO. TO A ANOTHER BUREAU POSITION THAT WAS A PERMANENT PENSION. WE WERE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FILL BEHIND THE THE FLOW OF VACANCIES NOT. NOT THAT WE COULDN'T FILL OUR VACANCIES IT WAS JUST TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THEM RIGHT RIGHT. OKAY MADAM CHAIR PROVIDING CLARIFICATION ON APPS MAY I SUGGEST THAT OF OFFER YOU ON THE C. P. I. CALCULATION YOU ASKED. I THINK YOU WERE ASKING WHAT AMOUNT COULD WE ADJUST RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT STATUTE IN CPR US. OF ADDRESS FEES AND THAT WOULD BE SEVEN DOLLARS -- IS WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ALLOWED UNDER THE STATUTE TO COVER THE FULL BUDGET ASK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW WE WOULD HAVE TO INCREASE THE FEE TO APPROXIMATE THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- AND WE CAN PROVIDE THAT RECONCILIATION THAT'S THAT'S TO CHRIS THE STAFF. THANK YOU JUST WANT TO READ THAT THANK YOU FREE **** ALL RIGHT NOW PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE ITEM BEFORE YOU MOVE TO OUR NEXT ITEM. ALL RIGHT THANKS SO MUCH IN COLLEAGUES WILL NOW MOVE TOWARD NEXT I AM COMFORTABLE. RIGHT SO ISSUE SIXTEEN THE DISPOSITIONS WORKLOAD INCREASE. HE ASKED ABOUT OF WHAT ARE YOU OKAY WITH MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SENTENCE GREAT OKAY. SO WE'RE NOW ON ITEM -- SIXTEEN PLEASE PROCEED. OKAY SO THIS IS A REQUEST THAT FOR TWO POSITIONS AN APPROXIMATE TWO HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IS SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA WHERE WE HAVE LEGISLATION -- AND WE'RE ASKING FOR RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION ON THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR I'M THERE TO FOR TWO BILLS -- THAT WE ESTIMATED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE THERE WAS THERE'S WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH IT -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE RESOURCES [inaudible] OKAY -- LA -- I DIDN'T CALLING YOU AROUND APPS MOSTLY BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT WE WEREN'T ACTING AND WE KNEW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE GREATLY REVISED BY THE TIME WE GOT IT BUT YOU CERTAINLY YOU HAD SOME COMMENTS ON THIS PLEASE PROCEED. LEE -- ANY DAILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RELATED TO THIS B. C. P. WE ARE RECOMMENDING -- TO YOUR LIMITED TERM FUNDING RATHER THAN ONGOING FUNDING IS REPLACED BY THE STATION AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE FOUR PIECES THE WORKLOAD THAT ARE LISTED AND GENDER BEFORE YOU -- WE THOUGHT THAT THE WORKLOAD WAS REALLY EITHER LIMITED TERM IN NATURE OR AT THAT THE WORKLOAD WAS UNCERTAIN BECAUSE A REALLY RELIED ON HOW PEOPLE WOULD REACT. ESSENTIALLY TO THE LEGISLATION AND SO LIMITED TERM FUNDING WOULD PROVIDE YOU DO WITH THE RESOURCES TO DO THE WORK BUT ALSO TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD IMPACTS AND TO THE EXTENT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. LEGISLATURE WOULD THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ACTUAL DATA THAT THEY CAN ACT ON I'M. AND OF COURSE WE JUST THE EXPERIENCE IN HEARD FROM THE FACT THAT BY OUR LIMITED TERM FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE APPS CASE WE WERE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN THE FOLKS THAT WE HIRED FOR AS LONG AS WE MIGHT HAVE INTENDED BECAUSE AS SOON AS THERE WAS A PERMANENT POSITION OPEN THEY MOVED OVER TO IT. SO I THINK WE'LL AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT I AM I AM CERTAINLY THERE IS A NUMBER OF THE ITEMS THAT. WE HELD. ON THAT I FEEL WERE POTENTIALLY ONES THAT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE LIMITED TERM -- IN THIS ONE I THINK WE'LL I WOULD ENCOURAGE STAFF TO LOOK AT MORE TO SEE WHETHER THAT. WILL WORK IN WITHOUT AND THE UNINTENDED AND EXPECT YOU KNOW NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. BUT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENT YEAH MANAGER ON IN THE BACKGROUND ON THIS PROPOSAL IN THERE'S A THE OTHER PROPOSAL THE WRIST RELATES TO LEGISLATION THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS MANY ARE NUMEROUS BILLS THAT COME THROUGH -- OFTENTIMES WITH VERY SMALL IMPACT -- BUT IT WE WENT BACK A YEAR AGO AND WE LOOK AT WHAT THE IMPACT OF TWENTY THIRTY BILLS PASSING THAT HAVE A MINOR IMPACT THERE WAS A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO WE'VE CHANGED OUR PROCESS -- INTERNALLY TO IDENTIFY THESE UP FRONT WHEN THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WE WE ARE YOU KNOW TAGGING THEM WITH THE SCHOOL IMPACT. AND THEN TO THE BEST WE CAN WE'RE PACKAGING THEM ONLY ASK FOR BUDGET RESOURCES -- SO THAT THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BACKGROUND ON THIS OKAY. RESHAPED THAT. I'M. BERMAN FINANCE YOU DO NEED TO COMMENT OKAY ANY COMMENTS FOR MY SMALL POTATOES WILL TAKE. YOUR LOOK AT LIKE CAN YOU ABSORB THIS AND WITHIN YOUR BUDGET MY COMMENT. SENATE BILL. ONE RICHARD PRYOR RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WILL NOW I PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT. ONE ANYTHING ON ISSUE. SIXTEEN RIGHT WILL MOVE TO ISSUE SEVENTEEN THE DNA IDENTIFICATION FUND REVENUE BACK FILL. SO THIS IS A SIMILAR PROPOSAL THAT WAS HER LAST YEAR OKAY. AND THIS IS A CONTINUED BACKS BILL -- LAST YEAR'S BUDGET INCLUDED A TWO YEAR BACK FILL AND SO THIS IS -- TO ENSURE THAT THE BACK FILL STAYS IN PLACE NEXT YEAR -- THAT ALSO I THINK THERE WAS A EQUIPMENT COMPONENT LAST YEAR THAT'S IN A SEPARATE PROPOSAL -- SO BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS ARE ARE ARE BACK THIS YEAR. AND VERY MILLER'S WITH ME -- TO ANSWER ANY OF THE LAB QUESTIONS CERTAINLY [inaudible] OKAY -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES. SOMEONE FINGERPRINT FEES WHICH I THINK WE HAVE. WHERE WAS THAT? ONE THAT'S NOT ON OUR BET ON I GUESS BY. YOU KNOW WE WE DO YOU. THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY NINE DID GIVE US. REVENUE FOR THIS PURPOSE -- AND IF I UNDERSTAND FROM THE BACKGROUND IMAGE IT'D BE. THAT THAT REVENUES BEEN DROPPING -- THERE'S ALSO SOME DISCUSSION AROUND FORTY SEVEN BUT I AT THAT WOULD ALSO INDICATE TO ME THAT THERE IS A REDUCTION IN WORKLOAD. SO -- CAN YOU. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ABOUT YES WE KNOW THE REVENUES BEEN DROPPING [inaudible] BUT CAN CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN WHY THE WE STILL HAVE THE SAME COSTS. ABSOLUTELY MANAGER THANK YOU I'M VERY MILLER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT WOULD SEEM LIKE. AS THERE WAS THIS DROP IN REVENUE THERE WAS A DROP AND WORK WELL NO NOT AT ALL DROPS IN REVIEWER SO SHE WAS DROPPING WORKLOAD BUT SOME ARE -- THE THE FACT IS WE HAVE AREAS THAT HAVE IN FACT SEEN SOME WORK LOAD REDUCTION BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN AREAS THAT HAVE HAD WORKLOAD INCREASES AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT IS -- THE SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. AND SO WHILE WE SEE SOME OF THESE MINOR DRUG OFFENSES REDUCED WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE CHANGES IN THE DNA WORKLOAD -- IT ACTUALLY INCREASES -- MORE THAN THE REDUCTION. WHEN YOU SAY THE SEXUAL EVIDENCE SAW KID WORKLOAD HAS INCREASED? DO YOU MEAN THAT MORE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SENDING YOUR LAB -- EVIDENCE TO BE TESTED -- THEY SEND IN MORE EVIDENCE EVERY YEAR WE SEE AN INCREASE IN THE DNA REQUEST OF A HAVE NOT JUST RELATED TO SEXUAL RIGHT BUT YOU'RE ALLOWED. TO YOU RECOVER COSTS RELATED TO THAT YOU DON'T PROVIDE THAT SERVICE FREE TO THOSE AGENCIES NO MA'AM. WE ABSENT WE PROVIDED FOR FREE. WE DON'T WE DON'T CHARGE AGENCIES FOR THAT AT ALL. IN I BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED THIS LAST YEAR AS WELL -- THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS CONTRA COSTA AND ALAMEDA THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LADDERS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LABORATORIES. AS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE DON'T CHARGE FOR THAT SERVICE AT ALL [inaudible] OKAY. ANY QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS. ONE WHICH COUNTIES HAVE FALLEN LABS THAT. NECESSITY -- TO USING THEIR COUNTY LABS VERSES THESE THESE FACILITIES. AND ARE YOU GETTING -- CERTAIN COUNTIES TO USE YOUR FACILITY OTHER COUNTIES NOT USING A FACILITY. I'M SORRY YOUR IS THERE VARIATION. OF USE BY COUNTY. WELL THE MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE THEIR OWN LABORATORIES USE% THEIR OWN LABORATORY FOR MOST OF THEIR STANDARD SERVICES THERE ARE SOME SERVICES THAT ONLY WE PROVIDE SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA DNA DATA BANK. WE WE RUN THAT -- AND WHERE THE CENTRAL POINT FOR CODIS THE COMBINED DNA INDEX SYSTEM AS WELL SO THEY ALL FEED INTO THAT. AS FAR AS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW MANY -- EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE -- TWELVE COUNTIES -- LABORATORY SUCH AS WALMART WERE THOSE LOS ANGELES ALAMEDA -- WHILE ANY TO HAS -- ONE SAN DIEGO HAS TO LOS ANGELES HAS. TO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN THE LIST BUT THEY'RE CONCENTRATED IN THE BAY AREA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REALLY THE BIGGEST COUNTIES YES. SO WHICH ARE THE BIGGEST COUNTIES WITH DONNA [inaudible] US. PROBABLY FRESNO IS ONE OF OUR LARGER COUNTIES THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LAB. SO THEY'RE BASICALLY YOU'RE SAYING IS THE BIGGEST COUNTIES HAVE THEIR OWN LEVEL OF ORANGE COUNTY SAMBAR NATO RIVERSIDE -- LA SAN DIEGO. WHEN WE SAY BIGGEST YES MORE POPULOUS YEAH YEAH I KNOW MALLS? LAND MASS WE WE WILL -- WE HAD NO POPULATION WE HAVE WE HAVE A YOU KNOW TWELVE COUNTIES THEIR CANCERS OF LARGE COUNTY PARK THIS AND AND I CHIRLA SO. THE TWELVE COUNTIES ARE MEMBERS OF THE ARE THE ONES THAT THE HIGHEST POPULATION. RUSH OAK SO THEY MOST OF THOSE HAVE. THEIR OWN THEIR OWN FACILITIES YES OKAY SO -- SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONES ARE POPULATED LOWER THAT. YES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LOWER POPULATED COUNTIES BUT ALL OF THEM SO. FORTY SIX OF THE CALIBER FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE OURS RIGHT OKAY SO NOT. SO WHAT I GET WHEN I GET FROM YOU IS THE BIGGEST COUNTIES THEY YES THEY ARE GETTING MONEY FROM US. WITH THIS BUT THE OTHER ONES. THE DAY OF THE GET THE SERVICES YOU DO. FOR FREE OKAY YES SO SO HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED CHARGING A MONEY. FOR WE'VE THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT MODEL SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST -- IT'S IT'S COME UP ALMOST -- OF IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS IN THE COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE FIRST OF ALL. GENERALLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE CHARGED FOR THE SERVICES OR TO OUTSOURCE TO THEM. AND HAVE THE MONEY. THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD OUR SERVICES THAT -- WELL ANY FEAR THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT CHARGE ANY FEE. NOT YOU KNOW. THIS SITE IS LIKE IS LIKE OF THE STATE DOESN'T CHARGE. ANYTHING. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF CHARGING MAYBE EVEN SOME OF THE FEET SOME OF THEM OUT OF THE COST. YOU KNOW OU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW IT'S NOT EITHER CHARGE ON THERE FOR EVERYTHING VERSES CHARGING NOTHING IT'S WE CAN CHARGE ROOM HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED AT THAT KIND OF THING. YES -- WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU DID THAT? WHAT HAPPENED WAS WE BROUGHT IT OVER WITH THE CHARGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO PER COUNTY YEAH IT DIDN'T GO WELL WITH THE LOCAL YEAH THEY DON'T LIKE IT'S HIS -- GET EVERYTHING FOR FREE IS LIKE A FIVE DID THAT TO MY GRANDSON HE WOULD. COMPLAIN TOO SO BUT YOU KNOW HOW MAY. IT ALSO SO -- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE IF WE ACTUALLY? CHARGE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COST. WELL. I CAN JUST GIVE YOU ONE A REAL CONSEQUENCE AND THAT IS THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD DECIDE WHAT THEY WANTED TO SUBMIT TO A CRIME LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS AND VICTIMS WOULD BE THE ONES THAT WOULD SUFFER. YEAH YOU THINK SO I BELIEVE SO SO IF WE DID CHARGE NOTHING WE CHARGE NOTHING. VERSES 20% SAY WITH A COUNTIES. YOU THINK THEY WOULD ACTUALLY. NOT HEY YOU BECAUSE AND IF THEY WOULD NOT PAY YOU BECAUSE THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS BETTER NOT TO PAY YOU THAN. TO HELP AFFECT. I THINK THAT THEY WOULD NOT BRING ME THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH PIECE OF EVIDENCE WAS MORE IMPORTANT BASED ON THEIR BUDGET. YOU THINK SO I DO. OKAY SO SO THE OTHER TO THE BIGGER COUNTIES THEY DO IT ON THEIR OWN. WHY ONE DAY -- JUST CLOSER FACILITIES DOWN WOULD YOU DO IT FOR FREE. AND THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IS YOU KNOW. CLOSING DOWN THE LARGER YEAH HY WOULD THEY HAVE A FACILITY IF THEY CAN GET YOU TO FOR FREE. I CONVENIENCE HELP WITH SOMETHING THAT -- YOU WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO ASK THEM BUT THEY STARTED THE LAMBERT I'M TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO OF OF FIND OUT IF YOU'RE WRONG. ECONOMIC MODEL IS CORRECT LIKE YOU SAYING THERE WOULD BE -- WITH THE CALL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. WELL AS THE MUNICIPALITIES AS AS MA'AM SKINNER AND I JUST TALKED ABOUT. THEY SOMETIMES DO CHARGE FOR SERVICES SUCH AS CONTRA COSTA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY DOES CHARGE IT'S LOCALS FOR ITS SERVICES BUT MOST OF THOSE COUNTIES ARE RUN THROUGH EITHER SHERIFF'S OFFICER DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE WE'RE A LOT OF MONEY FROM. THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND THEY DON'T CHARGE THEIR LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. RIGHT. SO -- IT'S A MATTER OF THEIR ECONOMIC MODEL IS THE SAME AS OURS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACT THEY'RE PROVIDING THE SERVICES FOR THEIR COUNTY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET THAT WORK DONE. WHEN WHEN -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REGIONAL IZED AND WENT TO ITS. BOTTLE OF HAVING THE LABORATORIES IN LOCATIONS IT DID IT DID THAT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE FORENSIC SERVICES. SO THOSE LOCALITIES DO THE SAME ECONOMIC MODEL YEARS AT THREE YEARS THREE YEARS OF WE CHARGE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD IN HEAVEN. THEIR DESIRE TO USE THE SERVICES. YES OKAY SO WHERE IS THE PROOF OF THAT. WHERE'S YOUR PROOF DO YOU HAVE ANY FOR FOR THE WELL IT SENATOR AS FAR AS PROOF I I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO ORDER SO I GOTTA ASK QUESTIONS WILL HAS HAD HAVE YOU KNOW. I DON'T MAKE A USE CASE BUT I'D I'D REALLY HATE TO BRING YOU A PIECE OF PROOF THAT SAID THEY DIDN'T TURN THIS PIECE OF EVIDENCE AND IN THIS PERSON GOT MURDERED SO HERE'S YOUR PROOF BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RUN THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO SELL. IT UP TO THAT GROUP THAT THE MEASURES -- THAT'S KIND OF A STUPID THING TO SAY BECAUSE IT YET THE PROOF THE PROOF WOULD BE THE PREFERRED BE THAT THEY DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE OF A FEE IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. NOT BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE OF NOT GIVING EVIDENCE WILL. ABSOLUTELY IF I IF I GO OUT TO HUMBLE COUNTY AND I DECIDED O TRY AND CHARGE THEM FOR EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT I WORK FOR THEM THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR BUDGET. AND I THINK THAT'S A MATTER OF LOGIC NOT NECESSARILY MATTER THEORY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WELL I'VE I'VE HEARD HEARD ENOUGH FROM YOU. NOT HERE A LITTLE BIT FOR ME YEAH I LOVED SO IT'S AN ORAL ANTI -- HAS TWO LABS. IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION WHEN I WAS A SUPERVISOR YEAH RIGHT AS THE SHERIFF HAD A LAB IN THE DA HAD A LAB [inaudible] AND THERE WERE JUST A A LOT OF UNIQUE HAVE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF WHO SENT WHAT TO CODICE AND ALL THE REST AND IT WAS. AN UGLY LITTLE. A FAIR THAT I STEPPED INTO -- WHEN I BECAME A SUPERVISOR OUR LAB WAS -- IN BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND FOR THE D. A. -- REAL INTERESTING. SITUATIONS ONE STORY BUT BUT WE HAD A SET UP KIND OF A SUB COMMITTEE. WITH THE CEO OF THE COUNTY THAT TRYING GET THE SHARE FOR THE D. A.. YOU KNOW JUST TO COORDINATE HIS WHY. THEY EACH HAD THEIR TURFS RIGHT. IT GOT TO BE REALLY ACCURATE -- BUT NOW THAT I'M NOT A SUPERVISOR JAMAICA DONE IT FOR FREE I CAN A FIRED EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT YOU. SO YOU HAVE THIS CHANNEL ABS. IT READS ARE SOLELY DOWN AND SO. YOU HAVE TEN REGIONAL LABORATORIES WHERE ARE THEY LOCATED IN. MY TEN REGIONAL EPITAPH. RICA REDDING CHICO SANTA ROSA SACRAMENTO -- FRESNO RIVERSIDE. RIBBON. SANTA BARBARA. AND SANTA CRUZ DOES THE REGIONALS AND THOSE WHO MANY AND JUST ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- WELL RIVERSIDE SANTA BARBARA -- IN SANTA BARBARA AND RIVERSIDE WERE OKAY WE'RE GOING TO CALL THAT OKAY. WHAT CLOSER IN BIRMINGHAM BUT -- IT WAS VERY VERY A VERY STRANGE SITUATION. SO OBVIOUSLY LARGE COUNTIES HAVE D. A.'S AT HAVE COMMENCED THEIR BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN LABS -- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE THAT IN THE ISSUE WAS WHY SHOULD THE D. A. WHOSE PUSHING [inaudible] PUSHING THESE. CASES WHY SHOULD BABY ALSO. DURING THE DNA LIKE THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTERESTS ARE YOU. HOW DO YOU RESOLVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST? IS IT. WHAT IT WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU CAN LIE? IS THERE WITH THE DNA SAYS THAT YOU'RE THE PERSON AND WHEN WHEN THAT IS NOT IN IN FACT THE CASE. HOW DO YOU PREVENT THAT KIND OF AGGRESSIVENESS BECAUSE I I HAD A DA THAT WANTED TO GET A 90%? CONVICTION RATE SO SOMETIMES YOU CAN JUST [inaudible] MOW DOWN. AND GET YOU KNOW FALSE COMPASSION OR WHATEVER HOW DO YOU PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING -- AT SENATOR IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION WE ARE NOT -- POLICE OFFICERS WERE NOT INVESTIGATORS WE RUN EVIDENCE AND PRODUCE SCIENTIFIC RESULTS WHAT THE INVESTIGATORS AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S DO WITH THAT. THAT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE HOW THEY USE THAT REPORT THAT WE HAVE GIVEN THEM SO. JUST TO CLARIFY. THE THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES IS THAT AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY ARE YOU UNDERNEATH YOUR TRAIN GENERAL'S OFFICE WE'RE IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OKAY SO THAT'S WHERE I'M. MAKING THE INFERENCE SO YOU'RE SAYING WERE IMBEDDED BUT WERE INDEPENDENT. AND WE'RE JUST PROVIDING. SCIENTIFIC DATA. NOT. MADE TO ORDER. BUT I'M BIASED THAT'S CORRECT. AT THAT'S ALL I WANTED THAT WAS THE QUESTION APOLOGIZE FOR UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT COMMUNICATING BUT WE WE JUST HAD SOME INCIDENTS THAT I WANT TO GO THROUGH ALL KINDS OF WAR STORIES BUT JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT THANK YOU MANAGER [inaudible] CERTAINLY NOW. THE I THINK. WE WERE TOUCHING ON SOME ITEMS THAT IF WE LOOK AT JUST ONE EXAMPLE. THE WHOLE ISSUE AROUND. THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FRUSTRATION AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT BILLS TO TRY. TO BOTH GET OUT BACKLOGS IN TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE THE DNA IS EXTRACTED AND PUT IN A DATABASE. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES IS WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT. SEND THEIR MATERIALS TO THE STATE LAB IN EFFECT AT NO COST TO THE COUNTY. ON NOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE COUNTIES WORDS SENDING IT ALL. BUT AT LEAST ONCE THE ISSUE WAS MORE REYES YOU SAW A LITTLE MORE BEING SENT FROM THOSE COUNTIES AND THEN YOU HAVE TO COUNTIES THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LABS WHERE. IN VERY OFTEN THAT LAB CHARGES THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN THE COUNTY. SO THEN THAT. INTO TIAS MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE COST ISSUE LESS WILLING OR MORE SELECTIVE ABOUT WHAT THEY SEND WHICH WAS FOR YOURCONCERN. THAT THEN IF. THEN WE DON'T HAVE. FULL DATA BUT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT SOME PLACES LIKE THAT WHERE IT WAS A COST TO THEM. WOULD LEAVE THE EVIDENCE ON THE SHOPS. SO YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT THAT BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS KIND OF ODD SITUATION WHERE. WE KNOW THAT IT COSTS US MONEY. TO EXTRACT THE DNA AND GET IT INTO THAT. DATABASE. THERE'S A COST. BUT THEN WE'RE HAVE A ON LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN TERMS OF WHO PAYS FOR IT. YES THE TAXPAYER ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR IT BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S THE STATE WIDE TAX PAYER PAYING FOR A WHOLE SET A COUNTIES AND IN OTHER CASES IT'S JUST THE LOCAL TAXPAYER. PAYING FOR IT JUST WITHIN THEIR COUNTY. AND THAT MAY BE. A BASIS FOR SOME OF OUR PROBLEM OF NOT. GETTING THIS EVIDENCE IN. SO BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOW POSED WASTE WITH JUST DEALING WITH HOW TO FILL THE STATE LAB BACK FILL IN NOT THE ENTIRE. STATEWIDE ISSUE ON BUT THIS DNA FEE THAT WE HAVE THERE IS SOME PORTION OF IT THAT IS GIVEN TO COUNTIES CORRECT. SO THE COUNTIES ARE SO WHILE THEY MAY NOT. GET ALL OF THE JUST THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE A BACKLOG SOME MONEY DOES GO TO THE COUNTIES. YES MA'AM IT'S THOSE WITH THEIR OWN LABS TO DO GET SOME MONEY FROM THE STATE. PROBABLY VERY INADEQUATE TO COVER THEIR FULL. LAB COSTS BUT THEY GENERALLY -- USE IT THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S WILL GENERALLY USE IT FOR COLLECTION COSTS FOR THE REST THE PROGRAM. BUT EVERY COUNTY DOES HAVE SOME DNA IDENTIFICATION -- FUND MONEY FROM PROP SIXTY NINE IN A LOCAL TREASURY ACCOUNT THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR PROP. SIXTY NINE SO IT WILL INFO ANYWAY WHAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING IS THAT PROP. SIXTY NINE CREATED THE FINE FOR THIS. AND IT'S INADEQUATE TO COVER. OUR STATE COSTS THAT COVER THOSE COUNTIES THAT DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN LAB IT'S ALSO IN ADEQUATE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE GIVE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES. TO COVER THEIR COSTS [inaudible] THAT. IT IT IS BUT PROPOSITION SIXTY NINE WAS PRIMARILY -- TO TO BUILD AND ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT THE DATA BANK THERE WAS A FURTHER GOVERNMENT CODE HAT WAS ADDED TO ADD OTHER CHARGES WHICH IS WHAT WAS AFFECTED BY PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE REASON WE HAVE A DEBT THE DEFICIT RIGHT ALL RIGHT. TO DEAL WITH A BACKLOG. NO SENATOR THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE OF DECLINING REVENUES TO MAKE UP FOR MONEY THAT WE'VE LOST BASED ON THOSE LOSSES THANK YOU -- OKAY SO. ANY COMMENTS FOR MORE. BERMAN FINE ISRAELI -- GO AHEAD LA OF IT'S NOT A CONCERN WITH THIS ISSUE IT'S JUST IN AS PART OF YOUR DISCUSSION. THERE'S THE PROP SIXTY NINE MONEY THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ADDITIONAL FOUR DOLLAR FEE THAT THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THAT'S PART OF THE OVERALL DISCUSSION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ON CRIMINAL FINES AND FEES IT'S PART OF THAT BROADER ASSESSMENT SO THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL MONEY GOING IN THERE BUT IT'S SUBJECT. TO THE SAME ISSUE SO I JUST WANTED TO OFFER THAT FOR YOUR DISCUSSIONS. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS OPEN. PRECIADO A WITH THINK WE'LL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IT WE DON'T A SOLUTION BUT WHATEVER WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE -- IDENTIFIED EXISTING REVENUE TO COVER THE COSTS THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH FOR GENERAL FUND WERE WILLING. TO EARN. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF ALL RIGHT THANKS SO MUCH WE WILL GO TO ISSUE. NINETEEN THE OUR CONSUMER PRIVACY -- ACT ITEM. AGAIN THIS IS A A TWO TWO BILLS THAT WERE ENACTED THAT THIS LAST YEAR. A AND I REQUEST IS FOR PERMANENT AUGMENTATION IN POSITION AND SPENDING AUTHORITY. TO IMPLEMENT THE MANDATE TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. THE REQUESTED RESOURCE IS WOULD ALLOW DOJ TO ENFORCE THE GROUND BREAKING PRIVACY MEASURE WHICH GRANTS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SPECIFIED RIGHTS. RELATED TO THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED SHARED OR MAINTAINED BY A BUSINESS. AND THE RIGHT TO EQUAL SERVICE AND PRICE. THE REQUESTED FOR TWENTY THREE POSITIONS. FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ON GOING IT'S CURRENTLY THE PROPOSAL SPLIT BETWEEN GENERAL FUND AND THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW FUND -- ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION AS GENERAL FUND TWO POINT NINE IS THE SPECIAL FUND KNOWN AS THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. FUND AND I HAVE STACY IN MICHAEL HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES THE DOJ RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS. BILL. ALL RIGHT I'M -- THIS IS CLEAR AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY -- LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE. ENACTED SO IT DOES -- IT WILL REQUIRE. SOME AUGMENTATION -- FOR IMPLEMENTATION BUT LA -- I THINK YOUR COMMENT WAS NOT ON WHAT WAS THE REQUEST BUT RATHER WHAT DEFINES SOURCE WAS. CORRECT -- OF THE NEW THE THE LEGISLATION CREATED AND YOU FIND A CONSUMER PRIVACY. FIND AND SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING US OF A DRUG DIRECTOR PREPARATION ALONE TO THAT FINE BECAUSE THAT FUND WAS CREATED BY STATE LAW TO RECEIVE. A CIVIL PENALTY REVENUES THAT WERE ASSESSED FOR VIOLATING THE LAW AND THE INTENSE WAS FULLY OFFSET DOJ'S COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. AND SO. ALONE WOULD ENSURE THAT DOJ HAS A SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO GET STARTED BUT WOULD ALSO COMPLY WITH LEGISLATIVE AND THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS. BY DOING THIS -- METHODOLOGY IT WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCT OVERSIGHT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT SO FOR EXAMPLE TO THE EXTENT THAT NOT ENOUGH CIVIL PENALTY REVENUE COMES IN. TO COVER COSTS AS THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT NEED TO GO IN AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE ACTION. FOR EXAMPLE CHANGING THE AMOUNT OF PENALTY THAT COULD BE CHARGED FOR A VIOLATION [inaudible] OKAY. QUESTIONS BY. MEETING ON THIS [inaudible] ONE BERMAN FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON CAME TO BE TREATED ON A FINANCE AM. NOTE THAT ALTERNATE RECOMMENDED BY THE LA -- CREATES A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES SUCH AS WHEN THE SETTLEMENT MONEY WILL ARRIVE HOW MUCH WILL BE RECEIVED AND WHEN IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE LOANS. AND SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. IF NOT ENOUGH SETTLEMENT MONEY ARRIVES. ADDITIONAL LOAN OR GENERAL FUND WILL THEN BE NEED TO PROVIDE. S. S. SET UP -- THAT THE NEED. I PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS VERY ABILITY BY PROVIDING THE GENERAL FUND AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LOAN FUNNY NOW. REDUCTION OF THESE FUNDS AND RESOURCES CAN BE REEVALUATED WHEN THE REVENUE FROM THE SETTLEMENT. IT COMES DOWN. BOTH APPROACHES SEEM TO HAVE PROBLEMS ON THE ONE HAND. THE APPROACH OF JUST FOR RUNNING THE CONSUMER BINDING. AND IT'S NOT AND IF IT DOESN'T COME THROUGH IN IF WE DON'T RECEIVE THAT KIND OF REVENUES AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO COMPENSATE THE CONSUMER FUND WITH THE GENERAL FUND BUT FRONTING THE GENERAL FUND AND NOT BEEN. SEEKING TO REPAY THE GENERAL FUND WITH THAT. SO MAYBE THERE'S A HYBRID ON IN STAFF. THINK ABOUT THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENT. I MEANI THINK WHAT PARTLY WHAT I HAVE BEEN. IT'S NOT BEEN NECESSARILY EXPLICIT BUT IN A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WE KNOWTHAT THERE'S A REVENUE SOURCE. ON THAT WE HAVEN'T YET EITHER MAXIMIZED ARE UTILIZED AND THEN WE USE GENERAL FUND BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO WE RARELY SEEM TO EVER REPAY THE GENERAL FUND. I'M TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOME ABILITY. TO AB MAXIMIZER USE OF SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THEIR PURPOSES -- THERE ARE MORE LACK. I'M JUST CURIOUS I'M WHEN YOU GET A MANDATE LIKE THIS DO YOU ET UP BY THE INDIVIDUAL. DEPARTMENT DEAL WITH THIS AND YOU DEVELOP A BUSINESS PLAN. WHAT IS TWENTY THREE PEOPLE WILL BE DOING A FOR THEY'RE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT? PLAYERS I'M JUST CURIOUS. YES THAT ARE MORE LIKE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE THE PROGRAM STAFF HERE WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL AND AND MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE BECAUSE THE STATE START. I THINK WAS LAST YEAR YOU STARTED WITH THE REGULATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT KICKED IT OFF SO WE CAN DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STACY SHAS ARE I AM THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE PRIVACY UNIT WHICH IS PART OF CONSUMER. I'M THERE ARE SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NEEDS TO ME UNDER THE CCPA ONE OF IT IS ENFORCEMENT ONE OF IT IS I PROMULGATING REGULATIONS -- AND IN ADDITION RIGHT NOW IS THE LOG SAYS WE ALSO HAVE A REQUIREMENT. FOR PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO BUSINESSES THAT SEEK OUR ADVICE. THE ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE WE'RE REQUESTING POSITIONS -- BECAUSE ENFORCING THIS LAW IS. IS GOING TO BE A MONUMENTAL TASK IT'S A GROUNDBREAKING LOTS THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY -- IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF ATTENTION TO TECHNICAL TECHNOLOGY AND TECHNICAL COMPONENTS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE LAW HOW THE LAW IS BEING COMPLIED WITH BY BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE BUSINESSES. AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE -- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENFORCEMENT -- RAMP UP THAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE IT IS EXCLUSIVELY ON FORCED AS BEST STATUTES THAT'S WORTH BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SO. IT'S US WE ARE THE THE FULL COPS ON THE BEAT FOR MAKING SURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE COMPLYING. IN ADDITION TO THAT AND AS CHRIS JUST MENTIONED WE HAVE BEEN -- DOING AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF WRITING REGULATIONS. WHICH THE STATUTE PROVIDES AUTHORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DO. WE ARE DRAFTING THESE REGULATIONS SO THAT THE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ALIKE WILL KNOW HOW TO MAKE. THE LAW WORK FOR THEM THEY CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS AS WELL AS BUSINESSES CAN. I UNDERSTAND HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE THE CCPA BUT IN ADDITION TO THESE THIS INITIAL SET OF REGULATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO DRAFT. AND DOING SO WITH GREAT YOU KNOW IN A GREAT RUSH SO THAT BUSINESSES WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO WE HAVE ONGOING REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND WE CAN PROMULGATE LAWS THAT WILL ADDRESS FOR EXAMPLE. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES OR OBSTACLES TO IMPLEMENTATION AND PRIVACY CONCERNS THE STATUTES FORTH. A SPECIFIC. AUTHORITY FOR US TO UPDATE THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OR UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS AS THESE FAST TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. TO HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WERE TRACKED THIRTY SPEAK. AND SO GIVEN THAT THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR ENFORCING THIS LAW. YOU'RE A YOU'RE HAVING THE JOY OF DEVELOPING EVERYTHING. AND IF SO HOW DO YOU SAID METRICS FOR YOURSELF IDEA MANAGERS OUT [inaudible] WELL. WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD I BASICALLY RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY THEPRIVACY UNIT IS A STAFF OF FIVE INCLUDING ME I'M A SUPERVISOR AND WE HAVE. FOUR IN CREDIBLY TALENTED ATTORNEYS I HAVE THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND BEFORE CCPA WE WERE ALREADY VERY ACTIVELY INVESTIGATING COMPANIES THAT ROOM VIOLATING STATE AND FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS. THAT PERHAPS YOU MAY HAVE READ ABOUT YOU KNOW IN THE NEWS. WE HAVE PULLED SOME OF THOSE TEAM MEMBERS OFF OF THEIR WORK IN TERMS OF INVESTING IN CONDUCTING THEIR INVESTIGATIONS ARE ONGOING AND NO CRITICAL TO ENFORCING STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MEET THESE IMPOSED DEADLINES -- BUT THAT HAS YOU KNOW REQUIRED ME TO DO A LOT OF REDEFINING -- AND MANAGING PEOPLE'S TIME SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH WITH THE THE TASK AT THE TASKS THAT THE STATUTE IS IMPOSING. AND SO. I'M YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF HIGH HIRING. TWO ATTORNEYS GENERAL ON BASED ON THE THE WORKLOAD THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US LAST. LAST SESSION I BELIEVE AS WELL AS AN ADDITIOAL PROGRAM PERSON FROM THE SAME WORKLOAD. SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL GIVE US SOME REPRIEVE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE THINGS ACROSS THIS INITIAL -- DEADLINE I'M BUT TO BE QUITE HONEST I MEAN WE ARE WE'RE WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD AND THEN ONCE THE CCPA GOES INTO A FACT. THAT WILL JUST CREATE EVEN ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD FOR US. FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY ENFORCING AT THE MISTRESS FURRY ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT TWENTY THREE POSITIONS WILL DO THE JOB. I CERTAINLY HOPE SO I MEAN I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S A A MIGHTY ARMY -- FOR THIS TYPE OF BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS AND WORKED WITH TWENTY THREE POSITIONS YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE. TO FILL ALL OF THEM YOU'RE SAYING -- I THINK WE COULD EASILY FILL THEM. WE WENT. I WILL DEFER. TO YEAH SO -- WE USE ARE THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER -- TO THE TO MONITOR OR TO TO GENERATE HOURS RELATIVE CERTAIN YOU KNOW PASSED SO THAT WE CAN PROJECT NUMBER OF HOURS NEEDED TO GET THINGS DONE AND SO. WE DO HAVE HOURS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND DEVELOPING THE REGULATIONS AND BASED ON THAT. AND WHAT THAT WHAT'S. REQUIRED IN THE BILL MOVE FORWARD WE'VE BEEN ESTIMATED THE NUMBER STAFF NEEDED. I THINK YOUR POINT IS A KNOT I I'M NOT SURE THAT WE EVER NOW BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE IMPORTS COMING IN. AT THIS POINT IN THE CALLS COMING IN IN THE INVESTIGATIONS AND AND THERE'S MORE COMING IN THEN THEN NOT AT THIS POINT. STRANDED I COME. FROM EXECUTIVE POSITIONS SO BEING A LEGISLATORS SORT OF DIFFERENT -- I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR WORKING HARD TO DEVELOP AND JUST TO THIS LEGISLATION -- AYE. I AS AN EXECUTIVE HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY WITH WATCHING CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN. YOU'RE AT THE STATE. TODAY WE HAD A BILL ON THE FLOOR ADD TO EXTEND THE CANNABIS LICENSE YOU KNOW IF I WHY DID THEY GET. DONE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON WHY DO I HAVE A DMV THAT. TAKES YOU KNOW ALWAYS LONG LINES WHY DO I HAVE. THIS GAL THAT'S RUNNING A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT AWAY. YOU KNOW THE LIST JUST GOES ON AND ON OF OF THINGS THAT ARE JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING. TO ME IS AN EXECUTIVE TYPE PERSON -- AND SO NOW AS A LEGISLATOR I GET LIKE WHAT TEN MINUTES OF YOUR TIME. THE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN AND I WOULD RATHER YOU COME UP TO THE FRONT AND SAY. I NEED TWENTY EIGHT POSITION. THE COVER THIS AND TO HAVE A SATISFACTORY RESULT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO DO IT. AS OPPOSED TO SAYING I GET TWENTY THREE WHEN YOU COME BACK TO ME AND SAY WE GOT IT BACK BILL WE HAVE A BACKLOG OR WE HAVE A THIS OR THAT. BY AND ADAM HOW TO HOW TO DO THAT TEN MINUTES [inaudible] RIGHT -- I GUESS I NEED. TO TO ENCOURAGE YOU THAT YOU'RE EMPOWERED. YOU KNOW THE THE BILL DOES THE UNIT BUT ALSO. BUILD IT SO THAT. IT DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO THAT MAKES SENSE SO THAT SO THAT I'M HAVE. TO WHINE ABOUT. NO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE COMING BACK NEXT THURSDAY AND WELL WE REALLY MISSED THIS ONE ARE ARE FOR I'D RATHER YOU CAN MAGAZINE WILL YOU LOOK AT ALL THE PROSECUTION'S OF AT ALL. BUT WE'VE GOTTEN LEGAL WITH CIVIL PENALTIES BUT ALL WE DID WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. UNDERSTOOD CENTER WERE LOCKED IN AND WE DO GO THROUGH A PROCESS -- WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND AND LA OVER. AND LOOKING AT THE WORKLOAD IN LOOKING AT OUR ESTIMATES AND WE'RE WE'RE GIVING THE BEST ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME GIVEN THE WORKLOAD TODAY. DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO COME BACK I'M AND I WOULD LIKE OR THE BACKLOG YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS. IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW PROGRAM AND WE'RE DOING. A REASONABLE ESTIMATE THAT WE ASK FOR MORE SURE -- WE COULD YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE WE'RE ASKING FOR WHAT WE THINK IS REASONABLE REASONABLE AND ACHIEVABLE IN THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE JOB SO. I'M LIKELY WILL HAVE TO COME BACK IN AND ADJUST IN THERE LIKELY WILL BE OTHER. LEGISLATION THAT GOES THROUGH TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I'M WHAT WILL BRING IT BACK IN AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS DO SOMETHING. ASK FOR RESOURCES THAT WE KNOW WE CAN DEPLOY AND AND HAVE UP AND RUNNING AND GET THE PROGRAM GOING. AND NOT HAVE RESOURCES SITTING IDLE -- BUT I ASSURE YOU WE WILL BE BACK HAVING A CONVERSATION AT SOME POINT. BOB THANKS FOR CUTTING TEETH ON WHAT IS A VERY COMPLEX AND UNIQUE SITUATIONS. BUDGET THANK. THANK YOU CENTER MOORLACH END UP BUT I WHAT I WOULD RAISE IS THAT IT IS [inaudible] I'M. DIFFICULT OF COURSE IN THIS MOMENT TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A WE KNOW IT'S AN INCREASED WORKLOAD. IS THIS AN OVERSTATEMENT OF NEED OR AN UNDERSTATEMENT IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE. BUT I NOTE THAT. THE TASKS RELATED TO THE FILAMENT ARE DEVELOPING REX. AND THEN PROVIDING GUIDANCE THOSE TWO TASKS WELL THE GUIDANCE MAYBE ON GOING IN TERMS OF WHAT'S POSTED ON A WEBSITE. THOSE FIRST TWO TASKS ARE. NOT. SO ONE GOING THERE ONCE THE REX ARE DEVELOPED ONCE THE AND THEN THE GUIDANCE WILL BE LESS. I SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. THIS NUMBER OF POSITIONS ARE NEEDED NOW. BUT ONCE THE REX ARE DEVELOPED IN VARIOUS THINGS THAT IT MIGHT BE LESS BUT THAT. I GUESS WHAT I AM. ASKING IN WHAT I DIDN'T SEE AN PREVIOUS REQUESTS NOT RELATED TO THIS ONE IS THAT [inaudible] ANYTIME. A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE NEW LAW. WAS IMPLEMENTED HE DIRECTS WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR OTHERS THERE WAS NO CON COMMIT AND REDUCTION THEN IN LIKE -- WE'RE GETTING THESE REQUESTS FOR NEW JOURNAL JOURNAL FIND. WHY WOULDN'T BE F. T. WE CREATED? FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RAKES ON BILL TAX. TWO YEARS AGO THAT'S DONE WHY WOULDN'T THOSE F. T. BE SHIFTED. BOB THE RAKES IN THIS ONE THEN STATE NO LONGER HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THOSE WRECKED SO. THAT THAT'S THE GENERAL -- THAT'S THE REQUEST THAT I HAVE TOWARDS THE AT THE OJ FOR ALL OF ITS BCP'S THAT I DON'T SEE. I JUST DON'T SEE COMING FORWARD. AND JEREMIH PROVIDE CLARIFICATION AND PROGRAM FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN. I THINK WE DID CONSIDER IN ASKING FOR THE POSITIONS RELATIVE THING RAGS -- BUT THERE WOULD BE SOME. DIRECTOR SOME OTHER WORK THAT WOULD COME ABOUT BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THESE REGULATIONS OR THE REGULATIONS ASSOCIATE WITH THIS PROGRAM WE SEE BEING NOT NECESSARILY A ONE TIME. THAT WE SEE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ONGOING NEED OR REGULATION WORK AND THAT WAS FACT. THIS -- THAT IS PART OF WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE ONGOING NATURE OF THIS ASK FOR THE REGULATION. RIGHT NOW ONE MAY BE DEBATABLE BUT YOU ALSO REFERENCE AND YOUR LAST COMMENT THE CENTER MORE LACKED SOMETHING ABOUT ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND I WOULD JUST -- THAT THIS. THE C. P. IS NOT BASED ON ANTICIPATION OF A BILL THAT IS NOT YET APPROVED. OKAY BIKES ARE ASKED RELATIVE TO THE FISCAL ESTIMATE WE DID ON THE TABLE YOU BILLS A REFERENCE IN THIS BE. A SEVENTY FIVE AT ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AND IN OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THOSE TWO BILLS. MY COMMENT THE CENTER MORE LIKE WAS MORTGAGE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. I JUST KNOW THAT THE AG'S OFFICE IS SPONSORING A BILL THAT HAS SOME RELATION. IT'S GOING TO THE PROCESS BY. WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DOUG SUPERS ON BEHALF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY CO SPONSORS OF AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE COMPANY. PRIVACY ACT PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU TODAY AMYNTAS ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO ENSURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF PERFORMANCE. PORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT I WAS ALSO ASKED TO VOICE. SUPPORT FOR THE REQUEST OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND COMMON SENSE. THANK. QUESTION IF YOU HAVE YOU REVIEWED THE BUSINESS PLAN YOU MAY. IF YOU WERE REVIEW THEIR BUSINESS PLAN AT ALL ARE. THE B. C. B. S. -- THE CCP A THAT. THIS DIVISION IS DOING. YEAH I THINK WE ARE SERVICE AREA OF YOU AND IN CONTACT AT ALL WITH THE DEPARTMENT. YEAH I THINK A OUR TEAM'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENGAGED IN THE FREE WORLD MAKING PROCESS THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH AND WE'VE. LOOK TO THE B. C. B. AND I THINK ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED ABOUT YOU KNOW. TRYING TO FORECAST THE HOPE OF NEED FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT IS. PROBABLY DIFFICULT BACK BUT WE THINK THAT THIS IS. YOU KNOW A GOOD A GOOD START AND WILL EVOLVE AS IT GOES ON BECAUSE THERE IS. LIKELY ONGOING REGULATORY NEED AN INPUT IN IT. THANKS FOR THE COLLABORATION. THANK YOU MEDICARE [inaudible] WELCOME. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY D. A.. B. C. P. RELATED TO THE INTERNET CONSUMER PROTECTION IN NET NEUTRALITY ACT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS THE CALIFORNIA INTERNET PROTECTION A NET NEUTRALITY ACT. TWENTY EIGHTEEN I AND WE'RE REQUESTING AN AUGMENTATION OF POSITION AND SPENDING AUTHORITY IMPLEMENT THE MANDATE TO THE CALIFORNIA. INTERNET CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IS. REQUEST RESOURCES WOULD ALLOW DOJ TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC AND THESE. WERE IN VIOLATION OF THE ACT. IT IS ASKING FOR NINE POSITIONS. PULLING ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THE UNSOURCED IT'S THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW. AND I HAVE A PROGRAM SUPPORT HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. IF ANY BACKGROUND IF NEEDED. THE ONLY -- ABOUT THE TIMING OF THIS. IS A LAWSUIT. LISTEN TO THE LA -- AND URBAN OF FINANCE. ARE -- WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE IDENTIFIED FUNDING IS ZERO ONE BUT WE DO HAVE -- WE ARE RECOMMENDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE SPECIFYING THAT DOJ CAN ONLY USE THIS FUNDING. ONCE ALL THE QUIRK PROHIBITIONS PREVENTING IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT ARE REMOVED. AND IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHETHER THAT WILL BE GONE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. SO IN YOUR AGENDA THEY THERE IS -- THIS IS HE'S TWENTY SEVEN AREA DONE IT DOES LAY OUT PIECES OF LITIGATION THAT ARE PENDING. THE STATE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHERE THE LATTER TWO BULLETS THE LAWSUIT AGAINST CALIFORNIA WERE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED UNTIL THE FEDERAL CASE WAS DEDICATED. AND EXCHANGE CALIFORNIA READ NOT IMPLEMENT. I'M THE BILL UNTIL CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. I WILL RECOMMEND. THIS SOMEBODY -- TERMS OF THE COURT CASES. WHAT'S THE TIMING ON THE WORK CASES BUILT TO THE BUDGET HOUSE OR YOU. THE BUDGETING AND HAD THIS REQUEST -- WELL MONSTER. HOW DID YOU? THE TERM THE DOLLAR AMOUNT AND I REQUEST BASED ON A THE BILL OKAY SO. PROBABLY SHOULD BE LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF LIKE WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S COURT CASES ARE GONNA BE ALSO BY JULY FIRST EARLIER WHAT DO YOU. AFTERNOON CENTERS MICROSOFT AND PROVIDING THE COMMISSION ON ACTION. THE LAWSUIT. THE THE ONE LAWSUIT THAT IS MOVING FORWARD AT THIS TIME IS THE ONE THAT OR WHERE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AMONG NUMBER OF STATE BOTH MOTHER STAKEHOLDERS. SUIT AND BARBARA TITIAN YOU. AGAINST THE REPEAL YES THIS IS ORDER REPEALING AND NEUTRALITY. THAT THAT LAWSUIT HAD AN ORAL ARGUMENT ON FEBRUARY BIRTH MOVED FOR QUITE QUICKLY. FISHING SPOT BACK IN AUGUST. WE'RE WAITING AND ASIAN. AS AS WITH THE WORLD. THANK YOU YOU KNOW WITH THAT WITHIN ABOUT A QUARTER OF THAT NATURE. WE'RE NOT GIVEN AN ESTIMATE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. WELL THAT WE WOULD IT WILL BE HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THEN THERE WOULD BE ALRP RIGHT. THEY WOULD NOT THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO FEEL. ONE WAY THE OTHER SOMEBODY WITH A ONE WAY OR THE OTHER RIGHT. IT'S IT'S TRUE CENTER ALTHOUGH AS YOU KNOW THIS IS. THIS IS A PECULIAR. ISSUE WEBER WITH THEIR POSITION IS. IN THE COURT OF APPEALS ON FIRST HEARING SO THE APPEAL HERE WOULD BE TO THE SUPREME COURT ON SIR SO. THERE IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY THAT. NOT PROCEED MIGHT NOT WANT RUNNING. ON WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SEND THAT -- YEAH TO BE A REASONABLE PERSON THEIR DECISION. I'M IF THE LEAD AGAINST HER FILED CASES AGAINST CALIFORNIA AND THEN DECIDE. TO REQUEST TO STAY THEN THAT PROCESS HAS TO KIND OF KICK OFF AND HAS TO BE LITIGATED. AND ADJUDICATED BEFORE THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO PIECES GOING ON AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IS LAID OUT ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA WHAT'S THE BOTTOM THE TWO CONDITIONS YOU'LL SEE IT HIGHLIGHTED NUMBERS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A CONSIDERATION. THE COMMITTEE WILL WANT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ROOMS OF THE THERE'S WAYS WE CAN SPEND MONEY WE CAN SEE THAT IN THE BUDGET AND THEN THERE CAN BE LIKE A DECISION LATER TO SPEND MONEY BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS AT WORK IS. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU CAN DO A ONE WAY THE OTHER YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL. SOMETHING IS DECIDED IN A COMMAND JUST GET A MONEY SPENT ON IMPLEMENTING SAYING OR YOU CAN. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. I AM A TIMING WISE -- I AGREE IT IS KIND THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE I THINK. ONTHE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LA -- TO PROVIDE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE LIMITING -- NOT ALLOWING THEM TO USE MONEY UNTIL WE KNOW THE PENDING CASES OF THE CORE I THINK I'M WE WOULD BE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION -- AND THEN THAT WAY IF IF YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO USE THIS MONEY THAT GOT REVERTS BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN WE CAN USE IN THE FUTURE YEARS BUT I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE READY. IN CASE YOU KNOW THEY CAN START USING THIS FUNDING WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO RESPECT AND EVERY PROCESS -- TO PROVIDE THEM THE RESOURCE WHAT'S MORE LIKE A PROVISIONAL ALLOCATION. PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. IS NOT ONLY OVER WELL WITH THE MOUNT BE BASED ON JULY FIRST OR WHAT. THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA BE JULY FIRST FOR SURE IS DETERMINED. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION US AS AT THIS IS HONOR VALUATION OF THE PCP WE THINK THAT. THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE IN TERMS OF THE CALCULATION AGAIN IT'S AN ESTIMATE. SIMILAR TO THAT -- AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE INDICATED IT WOULD MAKE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IF THEY DON'T SPEND IT ALL IT DOES REVERT BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND YEAH AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IN AND IF IT DOESN'T. GO INTO A FACT THEY CAN'T USE AS OF JULY ONE THEY START FOR EXAMPLE IN DECEMBER AND HE WAS JUST BE HAVING ACROSS FROM DECEMBER THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEN WHATEVER. I'M SORRY FATE MAY REALLY FAST I DO WANT TO JUST CLARIFY THAT I MISSPOKE IT IS NOT THE GENERAL FUND IS UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW AND SO IT GOES BACK TO A SPECIAL FUND. I'M SO THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND IMPACT I'M SORRY APOLOGIZE. YEAH OKAY OKAY THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW OKAY THANKS. I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS I GUESS. AND AS WE'RE HOLDING THIS SO WE WILL FIND MORE AB DO THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE'LL GET MORE INFORMATION. YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY ORDER LIST. LOOK AT OR MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THE A AG IMPLEMENTS A BILL. AFTER WE'VE APPROVED IT OR HE WAY TO OF THE ART [inaudible] RULE. WE HAD A DISCUSSION YET AT ALL I'M WHAT. WHAT? A SO WE JUST HOLD WE'RE JUST HOLDING. THIS WILL BE A UNDER YOUR SPECIAL NOTE FOR YOUR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIVISION THEN WE ARE BOTH WITHIN THEIR CONSUMER LAW SECTION HOWEVER OKAY. IS THAT. I THIS UNIT IN AND ARE YOU WRITING REGULATIONS ARE DOING ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE AT THIS POINT OR JUST ON ALL. ON AN INEQUALITY IN THAT WE WOULD NOT. THIS WOULD BE ENFORCEMENT. I'M REQUEST WE WOULD OCCASIONALLY AS WE DO IN WITH OTHER. WOULD BE ABLE. I WOULD NOTE FOR THE RECORD IF THIS IS A FEDERAL STATE. ON THE ENTIRE STATE. SO THE LAW WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED WERE ALLIES IN THE OTHER CASES. WE HAD STAYS IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. FOR WHICH EVERY CORTES HEARD THIS DAY AS LIVE. A SIMILAR SCENE EARLIER THAT I MISSED THAT. NOT SURE. ANYWAY JUST FOR THE RECORD. BUT ON THIS ONE THOUGH WHAT I MEAN WERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL BUT CERTAINLY IN EVERY. THE BILL IS LAW [inaudible] AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE WOULD APPROPRIATE. AND WE WOULD. THEN RECOVER IT OF COURSE TO RETURN IT TO THE FIND IF IT'S IF WE CAN'T BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION. SO THAT THAT IS CERTAINLY. BACK THAT ANYTHING WE APPROPRIATE COULD BE CHALLENGED IN THE COURT. IS ALWAYS AVAIL IS ALWAYS A PRESS IS ALWAYS OF WHATEVER. ACTOR SO. WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN BUT I THINK WE WILL. YOU KNOW MY RECOMMENDATION THE WORLD ANYWAY WILL BE. AS WE TAKE THAT BUDGET ACTIONS WAS WE WRAP UP TO ACT ON THIS. ONE ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY SO ISSUE TWENTY ONE THEN WE HAVE OUR OVERSIGHT THIS IS A NEW AND EXPANDED CRIMES PCP. THE NEW AND EXPANDED FRIENDS PCP IS AGAIN IT'S A PROPOSAL. RELATED TO SOME LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED -- WERE REQUESTING ONE POSITION AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ON GOING. THE INCREASED WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH UPDATING AND MAINTAINING A STANDARDIZED SET OF TABLES TO BE USED BY CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES AND SUBMITTING CRIMINAL RECORDS AND INFORMATION OR YOU JUST OF IT. RIGHT I LA -- WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO PROVIDE KIND OF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION OR WHY RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED AND IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY. THE STATE THE LISTS CANNOT BE UPDATED WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES LEGISLATURE WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE LEGISLATURE AN AXE BILLS EVERY YEAR. THE TABLES SHOULD NEED TO BE UPDATED ONCE A YEAR. AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY DOING AND AREN'T AVAILABLE TO DO IT. I'M MOVING FORWARD [inaudible] GOOD POINT -- WITH RC JUST DIVISION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW PROJECTS QUITE A BIT OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS -- LANDED WITH THE C. JUST DIVISION AND THIS IS -- AN ESTIMATE ON WHAT'S NEEDED. TO HAVE THIS SERVICE OR TO HAVE THIS WORK DONE ON A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS. AND TO HAVE A RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO DO THAT -- SOME OF THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN NINE FIVE THREE THE SB THREE FOR THE EXPANDED TEARING BILL. WAS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND AND THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS. IS A DIVISION AS A WHOLE SO THIS WAS -- SIMILAR TO THE ONE I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGISLATION WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A RESOURCE ON ALL THOSE. WERE ASKING FOR SOME OF THOSE IN A MORE STRATEGIC MANNER OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A BROAD. RESPONSE BUT AGAIN IT'S I GUESS I HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF THE LA -- ON THIS ONE BECAUSE IF THE WELL I A MIGHT QUIBBLE WITH WHAT THE DETAIL IS IN THE EXCEPT UNDER. ONE AS OF BY SEN I DIFFERENT SENSE I HAVE OF WORKLOAD. THIS ONE DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE. WHAT THE WORKLOAD IS YES GENERALLY THAT WE MIGHT HAVE MORE? AND YET IF IT'S REALLY JUST UPDATING -- LISTS THAT ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. ARE THEY WHY WE NEED THIS IS THIS KNOCKED MANAGER -- ADDITIONAL [inaudible] ALLOCATION. WE HAVE A MARK SAME HERE FROM A DIVISION WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO WRITE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE. IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL I CAN DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OF THE PROCESS OF THE DAY -- THE WAY THAT THE TABLES ARE MAINTAINED IT IS VERY REACTIONARY PROCESS. NEW OFFENCES AS GET ADDED TO THE TABLE AS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FOR THEM AT TIME OF A REST. IT'S NOT DONE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AT THERE'S NOT STAFF THAT CURRENTLY SUPPORT THE STATE WIDE. ABEL'S IN GENERAL. IT'S DONE BY REDIRECTING STAFF THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. WHAT ALSO IS PROBLEMATIC ABOUT THAT PROCESS IS DUPLICATION OF STATUTES THE GIFT BUT ON TO THE MASTER TABLES? AS ONE AGENCY ASKED FOR AN OFFENSE TO BE REPORTED THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VARIATION OF HOW THE REQUESTED THAT IN A DIFFERENT AGENCY. ONE AGENCY MAY REFER TO IT AS THE CODE SECTION ANOTHER MAY REFER TO IT AS A SUBDIVISION. SO THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE ON THE TABLE TODAY THERE ARE REPEALED CODES THAT STILL EXIST. THERE'S CODES THAT ARE DUPLICATED BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN REPORTED BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES SO WHAT WE HAVE INTENDED TO DO AS PART OF GENERAL KAMEL HISTORY IMPROVEMENT. IS TO CHANGE THE PROCESS FOR HOW INFORMATION IS TABLED. OUR INTENT IS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE LOOKING AT IT FROM THE TIME THAT A NEW BILL IS INTRODUCED. AND ANALYZING IT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS I'M WORKING WITH HELLO JUSTICE AGENCIES. PRIMARILY THE COURTS D. A.'S AND AUSTIN AGENCIES LAW ENFORCEMENT. MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY NEED THE INFORMATION TO BE TABLED. SO THAT IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR THEM IT'S BASICALLY A A CHANGE THE WAY WE'VE DONE THINGS HISTORICALLY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE MORE CONSISTENCY IN THE DATA AND TO REDUCE THE DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION OUT THERE. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS RATHER MINOR IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT I THINK IT IS YES AT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION. TO IN TERMS OF HE OVERSIGHT WE PROVIDE. IS THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE YES [inaudible] WITHOUT ANY. ANY ERA INCREASE REQUEST. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. ALL RIGHT WE'RE ALL NOT OPEN. AND WE ARE NOW GOING. TO OUR LAST ITEM. WHICH IS -- A FOURTEEN IT WAS ZERO F. AMBLING CONTROL OVERSIGHT. IT'S ITEM. FOURTEEN YOU MAY PROCEED. MADAM CHAIR STEP MISSION MáS WHO IS HERE FROM THE YOUR FAMILY CONTROL. THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE LAID OUT IN THE END. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON. LOOKS LIKE I'M JUST REVIEWING STAFF COMMENTS IF THERE IS TO BE THREE ISSUES THE BACKLOG ANALYZE INSPECTION. AND THEN TWO OTHER ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH -- TRYING TO ADDRESS WHICH IS THE BLACK JACK ISSUE AND THE ROTATION OF THE THEIR DEAR POSITION ISSUE. I'M JUST KIND OF VERY -- GENERALLY ABOUT THE LICENSING SECTION. ARE THERE A BOX AND ONLY ONE HUNDRED SOUTH ON IN THAT SECTION WHO -- MONTHS RATHER RESPONSIBILITIES CONDUCT BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. IS REQUESTING RIGHT RATIONS LICENSESAND WORK PERMITS OR CARD ROOMS AND FOR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. OPPOSITION PLAYERS SERVICES WHICH I WORE [inaudible] RT PROVIDERS [inaudible] I'M. THE SCOPE OF EACH SUITABILITY INVESTIGATION VARIES DEPENDING ON LICENSE PLATE. AND AND THE COMPLEXITY OF IT TO THE ABSENCE HISTORY. THE ANALYST DO THEY RESEARCH ANALYZE EACH. BACKGROUND UTILIZING VARIOUS PERSONAL PUBLIC IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES. THEY ALSO LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS OF BUSINESS OWNERS IN ENTITIES -- VERIFY THAT ALL PERSONS WITH OWNERSHIP INTEREST FOR CONTROL IN THE GAMING OPERATION IDENTIFIED. IMPROPERLY LICENSE. THERE'S NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS IF YOU'RE IS FACING A LOSS OF THIRTY TWO POSITIONS IN THE LICENSING SECTION. A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE PAIR OF CHANGE WELL POSITIONS TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG IN THE SECTION. ON IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE BEER WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POSITIONS FOR THIS. WE THINK MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THOSE THAT MISSION OPPOSITIONS -- THOSE POSITIONS HAVE HELPED US A PRESS THAT BACKLOG IN THE LICENSE. THE FOR NUMBERS FOR EXAMPLE IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF THREE THOUSAND TWENTY NINE LICENSE APPLICATIONS. AFTER THE ADDITION OF THE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS AND THE REQUIRED ONBOARDING TRAINING. OTHER BACKLOG WAS DECREASED TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIX APPLICATIONS BY JUNE OF SO THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS INITIALLY PROCESS BE LESS COMPLICATED APPLICATIONS. AND EVERYTHING WE TRANSITION TO PROCESSING THE MORE DIFFICULT. WELL THESE POSITIONS ARE FULL TIME PERMANENT POSITIONS YOU'RE ONLY RECEIVED LIMITED. FUNDING FOR THEM WHICH BASICALLY HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF MAKING THEM FUNCTION IS TEMPORARY. WE'REHOPEFUL THE FUNDING WILL CONTINUE FOR THESE POSITIONS IN THE NECK. I'M ALSO NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE LICENSING SECTIONS PROCESSES A WORKLOAD. AND BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND WE LOOK FOR CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM THE AUDITOR'S THAT WE CAN USE. BUILD UPON -- DEFICIENCIES IN THE SECTION AND AND ENSURE THAT THE NUMBER OF ANY APPLICATIONS. IS REDUCED IN ALL THE FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT COME IN ARE DRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER -- ANY QUESTIONS I CAN MOVE ON TO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THEAND THE BLACK JACK IN THE ROTATION ISSUE [inaudible] I'M. THE QUESTION I HAD IS THAT BE A LIMITED TERM FIRST POSITIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. THERE'S NO B. C. B. ON THIS. SO WHAT WAS YOUR INTENTION YOU. DO HAVE THEM EXPIRE OR TO WAIT UNTIL THAT AUDIT IS DONE OR WHAT. WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING. WITH ADMINISTRATION THERE THERE IS THE AUDIT IT IS ONGOING AND THERE HAS. THEN IT IS NOT FINISHED AND SO I THINK WE WERE ALL LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS MIGHT BE. A AND TRACKING WITH THE BUDGET -- SO WE ARE TRACKING IT WE ARE AWARE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS POSITION ARE NEEDED THERE IS A PROPOSAL IN THE ONGOING. POLLUTION THAT NEEDED A AND WE RECOGNIZE THE EXPIRED AND LONG WAY OF SAYING I THINK THEY WERE WAITING WITHOUT A RECOMMENDATION. AGAIN. IT MAY IS WHEN THE RIGHT WE WOULD GET THE MAY REVISE MAYES THE A BM ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE THE AUTO. THERE ARE MORE LIKE. TRENDS ARE IS THERE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS. WERE BEING OFTEN STATED. BY THE GAMBLING. OPERATIONS. THE INDIAN RESERVATION CORRECT. I'M JUST WONDERING IS A UBER SPENT AT THESE ARE SAID SOME KIND OF COST. OR AYBE A REVENUE ENHANCEMENT TO THE STATE.

HAVE SOME KIND OF THOUGH THE BEER WAS BASICALLY FUNDED BY TWO SPECIAL FUNDS ONE THE INDIAN GAMING DISTRIBUTION FUND AND THEN THE ON THE CONTROL FUND THE SERGEANTS AND THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS BASICALLY. THEY'RE SO THE LICENSING THE BACKLOG DISTRICT LEADERS TO THE GARDEN OF THE THIRD PARTY -- WELL THE BUREAU DOES DEFINING DISABILITIES ON THE WAY ON THE TREBLE SIDE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT FOR THESE -- IN TERMS OF THE BACK. WITH ALL IN THE FAMILY. AND A COLD THIS IS NEW TERRITORY FOR ME THAT'S BY MASKING BASIC. QUESTIONS I'M JUST. WONDERING IF THERE'S A AN INCENTIVE FOR US TO BE A LITTLE MORE. BUT IN THE END IT WELL IT. WHAT WHAT DOES THAT WHAT IS THE CARD ROOM AFTER A DEALER THE STATE. THE CARD INTO THE FUND BASED ON DIFFERENT FACTORS SO THERE IS AN ANNUAL FEE THAT EITHER -- IT EITHER BY NUMBER OF CABLES BUT IF THEY MEET A CERTAIN THRESHOLD -- FOR FOR THE MONEY THEY MAKE THEN THE ISLAND. WAY UP. IN THE EAST WITH THE LICENSING INVESTIGATIONS THERE THOSE ARE GENERATED FROM -- IN PART BY -- EAT THEY PAY DEPOSIT APPLICATION FEES. A ONE TIME APPLICATION AND MEN ARE THERE IS A DEPOSIT PROVIDED AND BE ON AND BILL AGAINST IT WITH THE AND I THINK. I'M GONNA AFFECT MY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR LICENSING BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES DIFFER BETWEEN DIFFERENT. PARTIES AND CARD ROOMS PM [inaudible] THE I I AM I TO BE A DEALER. AND THE ESTABLISHMENT SAYS WELL WE GOT YOUR BACK JACK WE GO THROUGH THE I GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND I'M DOING FINE BUT I KIDS I GOT A HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO A FOR DEALERS THAT WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE. WITH THE WITH THE WORK. WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PEOPLE WHO. LIKE THE OTHERS WOULD HAVE TO GET A WORK PERMIT WHICH IS A LOWER STANDARD OF REVIEW. THANKS FOR EMPLOYEES THOSE WHO SUPERVISED OR HAVE AN OF DISCRETIONARY DECISION MAKING WITHIN THE PROCESS. AND A HIGHER LEVEL. THE OWNER OF IT. THE WORK PERMIT -- ARE ARE RELATIVELY. YOU KNOW THOUGH WE WHEN WE STARTED WITH THE BAT WE DO HAVE -- ADDITIONAL. I'M IN EVERY YEAR -- WITH THE BACK BUT WE REALLY KIND OF TALKING ABOUT ALL THE ANY APPLICATIONS BECAUSE IT KIND OF GOING THROUGH ALL THE OPPRESSED LONGER BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT -- YOU KNOW. THE SIDE -- EMILY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT FIRST WE IN ORDER ME A DIFFERENT ALLEN NOT ANALYST. WE HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WORK UNDER. THE WORK OUT ANALYSTS THE ONES BM. ANALYSTS TO THE IN AROUND MORE IN A MORE EXPERIENCED WOULD YOU LIKE TO PARTY MODE SO THEY KIND OF YEAH. AND THOSE. ARE DOOMED THE OWNER WANTS THOSE TAKE THE AND THE THIRD PARTY OWNERS TAKE A MUCH LONGER. THE BIGGER COMPANIES MORE THINGS TO LOOK AT REALLY INTERESTED IN -- ALL THE FINANCIAL [inaudible] FUNDING. THE TIME JUST. YOU KNOW. WE'RE REGULATING MINISTRY OF WORLD WHERE THE LOG JAM RIGHT. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT? THIS IS BENEFITING THE STATE HOW DO WE I SHORTENED THE EMPTY LOT YEAH I THINK IT'S SOME I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DESPITE THE END OF THE A NUMBER OF PENDING APPLICATIONS BUT ALMOST EVERYONE IS ABLE. TO WORK A LITTLE BIT INTERNALIZED THEY'LL GET THINGS THAT WERE NOT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM WORKING IN OUR I'M IN THE INDUSTRY SPELL BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE FULLY LICENSED -- YOU KNOW WITH A MUCH MORE STRINGENT. LONGER PROCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY WORKING. REALLY SHOULD BE WORKING. THANKS FOR LETTING ME ASK. BASIC [inaudible] HE EARLY IT'S THE POSITIONS AND WHETHER THEIR CONTINUED OR NOT THAT OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE. REVISITING ONCE. BUT THE OTHER -- ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AROUND R. SOME OF THE NEW REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT BE BEING PROMULGATED AND I'M NOT CLEAR THAT THERE WAS ANY. THE MEANING LEGISLATIVE ACTION YOU DIRECT. THOSE NEW RAG [inaudible] I'M. JUST BACK ABOUT WHAT. YEAH NO ONE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THE ROTATION THE THEIR DEALER. SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WERE GOING THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS. FOR SO IT JUST A BACKUP IN TERMS OF LIKE NOTIFICATION. BACK IN. NUMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COLLEGES I SHOULD'VE REYES THE PART OF THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE [inaudible] LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHERE ARE THE ROOMS ARE LOCATED? HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THERE'S POTENTIAL. FOR NEW RAKES YOU IMPACT THE REVENUE THAT THEY RECEIVED AND QUESTION IS SPEND THAT SINCE THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY STATUTORY CARD ROOMS. THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS. ELICITED THIS NEED FOR THE NEW RECORD [inaudible] SO. GOING BACK THEN SO IN TERMS OF THE THE PIRATE EITHER ROTATION THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE PLAN TO REGULATE. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT ACTIONS THREE THIRTY POINT. ELEVEN BY. LANGUAGE IN THERE ABOUT CONTINUES A SYSTEMATIC ROTATION THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE REGULATION SO. AND THIS ONE LITTLE BIT FARTHER BACK SO I THINK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE WAS SOME EFFORT TO ADDRESS -- THIS ISSUE -- THERE WAS A PROPOSAL IT WAS -- AS PROVIDED IN TERMS OF WHAT ROTATION MEANS. OF THAT WAS CHALLENGES AN UNDERGROUND READ IN THE UP TO THE MINUTE OF LAW. PLEASE READ. IT THAT'S KIND OF ARE THE BUSINESS POINT B. THE ACTUAL REGULATORY PROCESS BECAUSE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW. WE ARE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS -- YES -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE WE HAD NOTIFIED THE PARK ROOMS -- AND WE NEED A WE NOTIFY ORGANS AND THIRD PARTIES AND WE ALSO DO THE SAME WE NOTIFY THE GAMING. WELL EVERYONE KIND OF HAS AN INTEREST WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS MEET WITH THEM ON THE SAME DAY TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S GETTING THE SAME -- BACK IN -- I STARTED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE MET WITH.

KNOWING THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OFF ON DOING ANYTHING -- WAS IN THE SESSION AT THE END OF AUGUST WE MET AGAIN WITH THE GROUP INSTEAD LOOK NOTHING WAS. THERE WAS NO LEGISLATION SO WE'RE GONNA GO HEAD NUMBER AND ADDRESS CERTAIN ISSUES AND WE LAY THEM ALL OUT. ONE OF THEM BEING THE THIRTY THE ROTATION IS TO LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE RULE MAKING PROCESS -- HELLO WE'VE DONE SO FAR IS GOING THROUGH KIND OF THE REGULATION WORKSHOP WE DO A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WE DID NOT PROVIDE ANY CRAFT -- REGULATIONS WE WANTED TO WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS A SAYS WE'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION BEFORE WE ACTUALLY.
