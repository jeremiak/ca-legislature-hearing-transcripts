no I know we don't have to go park in napa I'd like to thank the co chairs and like thank for all of you for coming to you know as we know state federal actions have a dramatic impact on California's wine industry its ability to be successful for example earlier this year China retaliated to two hundred fifty billion dollars worth of terrorists imposed by the U. S. by slapping its own retaliatory tariffs including an additional ten percent tariff on wine this action place wines are produced in the United States at a price disadvantage unfortunately this affect California the most as ninety percent of white shipped around the ship the bride is produced right here in this state as co chair of the Senate select committee on California's wine industry and chair of the Senate governmental organizations committee I want to make sure that California's actions don't result in such negative impacts in that we take every opportunity to listen to those that will be affected by any such decisions as such I'm excited to be here today with all of you to discuss what the state can do to help ensure that the wind industry is thriving I one of things I wanted to mention -- my partner over in the state assembly is ill today he was planning on being here he could not make it -- but I'm sure he's at home watching this streaming live from his -- from his yes from his bet -- but with that -- have a Republican leader assembly member -- Waldron which I say a few words thank you and I'm so excited to have this meeting here because you know how I'm always talking about our wineries and our great growers down in San Diego and also to macula and we've got our the San Diego can even there's association he's sitting over there in a lonely table but he'll be but I am so excited because I do represent the healthiest district in the state because not only do we grow grapes and have wonderful wineries but we also known for avocados and are all of oil in our citrus and our sunshine so you can't beat that for the healthy district is I I have the whole city of Temecula in my district they're celebrating fifty years and as we know San Diego has been -- doing whining growing grapes for over a hundred years in Escondido one of the other cities in my community has a special day every year call great day recognizing the grape growers from going back well over a hundred years so I'm very excited and we can you know keep highlighting the economic positive -- impacts of great growing and the mind is the industry in not only this region but California thank you what grades so we'll move on and get to the actual meat of why you're all here today -- first I would like to introduce and welcome -- ed Embley -- he is -- with the San Diego wine industry I got to chat with them a little bit before we started and we have a lot of in common -- particularly farming and he -- at one time is family raised chickens and -- X. they did the egg industry and that's a tough industry to be in but he's moved on to bigger and better things and to work with the plain industry -- and he's with the farming background involved in agriculture his entire life in state animal science at Cal Poly Pomona I'm sorry was at cal Polly Seles Obispo we'll talk about that later and -- with that without further ado -- welcome at thank you very much for that introduction -- and I would like to welcome those senators and assembly members and to our beautiful skyline of San Diego and the wonderful rain that the you brought with you from up north -- I'd like to state that -- send you county actually was the location of the first one read it was established in California in seventeen sixty nine by the Spanish mission system and -- that's something that's always overlooked many times but we are very proud of that in even the logo of association -- we kind of put that in there too that this is will wind began in the state gold rush southern California was really the the center of warning great growing in the state and -- this continued for many years and even as late as eighteen seventy -- the city of Los Angeles was noted its nickname was the city of vines and -- kind of represents can water background in southern California is what really change the the landscape of San Diego county one of the the landscapers Inyo county warning industry was prohibition in nineteen twenty -- probation -- it affected the southern California industry especially to the extent that there were only two wineries that really exist today that were there at that time or prior to probation and -- they they survived by making sacramental wine and also producing wine grapes that people could buy and you know make it and make one in a bathtub but -- due to one reason tenure with county that did manage to survive today as the burn are wondering in Rancho Bernardo and also the for one week now named -- the forgotten bill winery in in -- Escondido we could fast forward to two thousand and ten -- that's with that's with the county of San Diego adopted the turn one new ordinance by the board of supervisors of this ordinance reach me generated the entire industry in San Diego county -- the the orders were spearheaded by our local supervisor Diane Jacobs -- she led the whole industry with this led to a whole new industry of boutique wineries in the county -- my next line yeah -- this slide represents the number of -- one gorgeous this is the way more licenses that are issued in the different counties of the state are you can see that same day -- actually has a hundred and seventy four license to one growing -- a permits in the state and we exchanged -- to make it -- by almost a hundred percent -- of these hundred and seventy four of Lysons winegrowers tied to Lysons -- hunt one hundred and fifteen of the more active wineries in the county for and you can see by this slide that up until two thousand four we had a a real low issuances of new licenses -- ran from one to to actually here and end with the anticipation because that one is was and was worked on for many years but with the anticipation of -- that one is coming to affect the world more applications for you -- applied for and you can tell that in two thousand and ten it really took off because of the application rate -- exit ended up I think in two thousand seventeen we had a a twelve a two thousand sixteen we had a total of -- twenty six licenses issued in the county of San Diego -- the F. thirty the in I I will explain a little bit the dip in the end of the graft that was only up until -- July of this year so it it kind of construed that crafted shouldn't take that sharp did because we have had quite a few a licenses issued since that -- in two thousand and we did an economics impact study -- of the -- warning growing and industry and saying you county two thousand sixteen and we read -- fresh that study in two thousand seventeen in a couple of the -- with on the two thousand and seventeen study our industry -- generated twenty six million dollars in sales -- for in the county and it had a fifty million dollar a year impact in this represented a forty and forty percent increase from the previous study really the dynamics of the industry is really growing -- okay dish map shows the county of San Diego and also the -- three ABA use the represented in the county and -- so San Diego county is home to three AB aids the light green door which covers most of this map is actually the south coast -- ABA and it stretches from our room all the way down to -- the Mexican border and it covers most of the county -- we have a a little bit darker map and that is the scene you know I mean that is a remote valley ABA and you can not quite make it out but between with the Ramona Valley aviators in Escondido there's a small were it's almost a more yellowish tented area and that's the samples call Valley eighty eight and actually the simple call valley AVA is one of the oldest -- eighties in the country I think it ranks third or fourth grade behind napa and though it might be one Ohio I think there's actually the first one but -- so we were pretty proud about that and -- actually most of the warnings in the county coast eighty eight although it does get confused a lot of times with to macula because Temecula actions in the same but -- since it encompasses rural area we we share that with them -- let me back up to the slide once again I one thing I would like to point out of the black dots on the map that represents -- each dot represents a different winery in the county in our industry is very diverse -- it stretches from the north the county to the south the county to the east county and along the coast -- so as opposed to some other is that were wineries are very concentrated -- we're really spread out throughout the county a one thing this does do this allows for many variations in the the growing environment of grapes -- which is really -- because really if you come to San Diego county -- you do get a a it you can taste a lot of different types of wine -- slide five represents the increase of a production in the county and and -- also the increase of acreage in the county anything will come of that amount of a correction of the incomes harvested -- our average production runs about two tons per acre and this remains the grapes and the one or the one in the in the produced in the county -- change a very -- concentration of flavors and complexity with low production yields -- slide six service the different varieties and how they're distributed in accounting -- Cabernet Sauvignon being the the most -- slanted but -- really there's not a lot of difference between -- the ten top of righties here -- as far as some of the concerns with some of the gross in the county -- one of the concerns is the state water board investor là discharge permit that is a -- permit this required of any -- commercial agricultural processor a producer in the state -- no matter what the size and we found that the the small boutique wineries really have very minimal effect on the watershed in the county but you know we're really treated like thousand acre farm that might use a large amount of irrigation might have more impact -- and that's an issue that I know the can't Sania county farm bureau has been working with -- the local of water board of to see if -- we can maybe come to some interest understanding and some recognition that the impact that we have on our ecosystem is not as large as as what of the permit might think it is and a few comments about myself eight did have a nice introduction but I am the president of the case Sandia counties veterans association which represents over half of the wineries in the state in the in the county excuse me of this association is composed of urban -- book teeth Jose wineries and small wineries are and they are located in the unincorporated areas of the county and also several cities within the county ever control my life growing up in a business with cal poly promoter wearing graduated there I serve time in a nice lunch marine corps during the Vietnam era and more recently along with my wife and son we started hungry hawk vineyards in Escondido and -- actually the adoption of the two thousand and ten -- boutique winery órdenes in the county was one of the main -- points the promised to starting the winery because if this had not happened -- the economic to cross before the enactment of this -- legislation -- would have been the application of major management and general accounting goes will run up to a quarter million dollars which will ages does away with the small forming aspect of the boutique winery industry of just to sum up my should in the San Diego county jury grand jury from two thousand seven two thousand eight as a the committee chair of the Auburn at auto in the ministration committee and I also served on the house of accountable for six years since I wasn't have called industry for a period of time -- thank you for everybody listening to what I had to say and -- welcome and I really look forward to the rest of this question today thank you so thank you very much Mister Emily and I'm going to first ask if any of the -- committee members have questions the summer Waldron okay thank you -- since my son is -- right now is looking to going to college is a senior in high school so I heard about -- your Vince viticulture technician apprenticeship program and labor gap could you tell us more about that and how that got set up and how it works all we do have one member of that committee here to the hearing today and she was going to go into depth on that but -- that is a program that was really started -- to help provide people to grow up into the industry -- we do everything manually and by hand and our wineries in our vineyards -- because there's the small small size we can't really afford mechanized methods of pruning or harvesting so it does get back to do manual labor -- it does require a skill set a sales a to properly to that and the bill to cultural program was really bad on to help provide a basic course to people in the in the the room wanting to get into the industry -- and it also educate them on -- how when we operates in sales -- taste hero so it's a very broad based -- room -- something that I'm very happy to be involved with I serve on the board of directors for that organization and -- I am proud to be in that position yeah Mister Emily -- as you know each state has different wind shipping regulations can you discuss the impact that this may have on your members and what you do to educate them on the different -- shipping regulations yeah that's a real can of worms -- the wine institute has been a great purveyor of information on that subject and it really gets down to a point for vault small when Reyes to ship out of state it's almost impossible on your own -- each day normally requires a license and a permit -- to be renewed each year at sometimes preserve central rates -- the bookkeeping so without some -- other industries that help support us in that it would be almost impossible name sharper and I'm not trying to make a promotion here but actually we sell one to them they do all the paperwork -- they ship us being sent us a label -- the ship and -- they collect all the money in it for the money minus their and expenses to us and they have all with the state permits -- and they take care of the book worked -- Adam well I find it quite reasonable fee which with that company maybe nine months prior to that we had individual lessons for the state of -- Michigan Colorado in I believe Arizona even just three states really made a pretty it impacted office work you asked one question right now I'm sure someone's going to have more questions afterwards -- please contribute as we move forward okay thank you very much thank you so much Sir in a wonderful job okay thank you as you all know today we're gonna be focusing on regulations level in this next panel we have brought together a true all star group to be able to have different perspectives ensure those perspectives with you first of all we'd like to go to bring up Linda make Williams she's a wine maker and owner San Pasqual winery to small urban winery here in San Diego county we're grateful that she's can be providing her perspective -- coming from a director producer county we're truly appreciated the Jacob Jacob apple Smith director of California department of alcohol beverage control is here today he's been with the brown administration since he was Attorney General job of regulating all alcoholic beverages across the state he's going to providing the state by perspective the last person we're gonna be hearing from from this panel's mac McDonald president of the association of African American vintners an owner in wine maker that vision sellers we hear so much about the fruit -- in the wind in the stories behind it really where there's a lot of work is on the regulations -- and being able to comply and we welcome all three of you to the panel of five to seven minutes -- give you thirty second warning in the floor is yours and good morning my name is Lynn heavy use the Mike if you don't mind good morning up my name is Linda make Williams my husband and I own Santa squall winery where local urban winery just outside of San Diego in the city of la mesa and also the wine maker one of the almost twenty women wine makers in San Diego county yeah about ten years ago now when it was located in a small warehouse producing a few hundred cases of wine a year I was a middle school speech therapist and my husband was and continues his full time employment as a research psychologist we had plenty of experience with wine drinking but no experience with wine making similarly the vast majority of San Diego county vendors and wine grape growers are first generation taking down the challenges enjoys a vineyard and winery ownership while keeping their day jobs or after retirement our goal had been to open a wine bar we signed urban winery for sale just after the regulations changed that allowed wineries to also sell wine by the glass instead of just a wine tasting it seems that it could be the wine bar without the middle man if we could make our own wine we bought the winery and when I wine maker was no longer available I went back to school nights in Somers while taking on wine making duties I completed one production class at a local community college during our first production season and then the online winemaker certificate program from UC Davis now we produce about four thousand cases of whining year and we have won numerous awards from the county state and international wine competitions yeah we're excited thank you we now currently employs sixteen people at four different locations in the San Diego area also send wondering is one of the almost twenty urban wineries in San Diego county typically located in city industrial areas urban wineries do not have their own vineyards but by grapes from local growers within the county state or some even from outside of California we checked the grapes here and produce the winds in our facilities although not bound by the county winery ordinance regulations urban wineries was followed local city regulations in addition to the state A. B. C. T. T. B. and now FDA regulations I was also the first woman president of the San Diego county vintners association from twenty fourteen to twenty seventeen and I currently serve as the alternate director for southern California for the wine institute the San Diego county vendors association has worked to address challenges to building our local wine industry unlike more established wine regions San Diego does not have an adequate supply of trained winery and vineyard workers available in the area to remedy this the business association worked with local Cui America community college and the department of apprenticeship services to develop a two year apprenticeship program the San Diego viticulture technician apprenticeship program we call it the tap as the program is based on apprentices taking designated classes at the community college that may be more generic such as your occasion and then learn the specifics related to vineyard management and wine making during the on the job training apprenticeships to develop an on the job training curriculum base we developed a list of critical task for working in the vineyard winery and tasting room and assigned hours that may typically be required to develop mastery in each each a press takes one class per semester on the community college campus and completes fifteen hundred hours per year of paid on the job training at local vineyards and wineries I just building vineyards and wineries demonstrate and teach best practices and report back regarding apprenticeship apprentice progress towards meeting these establish goals thanks to the California apprenticeship initiative grant through the California community college division of workforce and economic development we were able to install a half acre demonstration vineyard on the queen American college campus for our premises to participate in an actual installation and now vineyard maintenance and a couple of years we look forward to the premises harvesting and making our first wine I next step is to help add viticulture class to the community college curriculum the apprenticeship program is sponsored by grants fundraising and small contributions from the STC VA and apprentices employers unlike most apprenticeship programs we are not the beneficiary beneficiary of large labor unions apprenticeship employers must hold workman's comp insurance and have a payroll system in place that being said unfortunately the majority a vineyard and winery owners in San Diego county were small and family owned and operated carrying workman's comp insurance for the small produces is a financial hardship so they are not able to participate in the apprenticeship program to share their knowledge and experience and benefit from an additional hand we hope to address these issues in the future traditional grants to assist small vineyard and winery owners to be able to access this we did have our first graduate last spring who is now on an entrepreneurial track as a vineyard consultant for small vineyards in our county her experience in the program was truly life altering moving from from a desk job to the vineyards where she sees a horror movie life ahead of her her new found skills have also positively impacted the quality of grapes from local vineyards where she has worked I second apprentice will graduate in December we currently have six apprentices and will interview new candidates in the coming weeks we are expanding our reach to individuals who will turn twenty one during their time in the apprenticeship those under twenty ones will be able to vote on the job training time to the vineyard and winery without tasting of exposure I program is small but growing at a rate so our local vineyards and wineries can hire newly graduated of apprentices as they are available two minutes thank you our predecessors will also be qualified to continue to a four year college program if that's their desire remain such as the maze of different regulations for out of state direct to consumer shipping as well as finding the time and gaining expertise to address the growing numbers of forms reports and paperwork required by kind of governmental agencies now including the FDA it is difficult to start up a new small business of any kind let alone one depended on agriculture there's so many variables that cannot be controlled such as whether water shortage vectors plant disease and natural disasters such as fire some of these challenges can be controlled are changes in government and regulatory policy such as reduction of standardization and or standardization of paperwork elimination every step redundant reporting of information to different agencies the water runoff standards standardization of federal and state tax rate categories for alcohol levels and reporting schedules other state shipping regulations and antiquated regulations regarding wine sales and advertising of wine and winery off site events another challenge is the length of time for application approval for -- to license or modification to a current license now six to eight months or longer if there any complications such as simple clarification information or delays into police department reviews the length of time for an initial -- to license to be processed improved is a major hindrance for wineries in general but particularly for small family owned wineries as wine cannot be made before production licenses granted production of red wine takes up to eighteen months of more from harvest to market our colleagues in breweries can bring saleable product in thirty days and wine shops and liquor stores are just a phone call away from their distributor to fill their shelves modifications to existing licenses is also unlikely process that starts pretty much from the beginning rather than a more streamlined process giving existing license data that's currently on file with the A. B. C. for example a recent application to add a production component to an existing tasting facility took more than six months we do appreciate the recent changes implemented such as reduce federal excise taxes the ability to have corporate tasting rooms hosting more than one winery and sharing access to tasting room space for adjacent wineries and breweries and closing the wine industry in San Diego is a great success story we're we're still facing a number of challenges thank you for the opportunity to share our story and concerns thank you so much miss with billion miss Williams very grateful for your testimony today I know that we're gonna have questions what we're gonna do is we're gonna hold questions until each of our presenters have an opportunity with a could be to turn the floor over now to take a bath apples with the California department of alcohol beverage control Sir thank you so much of five to seven minutes we're grateful you're here great thanks center -- I wanna I'm gonna touch on three things just a quick overview of the department I'm gonna talk about tight house rules and how the one is you fits into them and then cover three of the most -- commonly asked questions of me in the wine industry in terms of some of all being issues so quick on the department -- we have four hundred and fifty eight employees we had four hundred and fifty six employees in nineteen fifty five when we were found it so we've grown by two people over the years government bloat at its worst right there -- we are about forty eight percent peace officers -- who are focused in around licenses talismans we do variety of narcotics and prostitution and other lots of underage drinking can focus in around bars and restaurants for the most part very few prostitution things we've done our wineries for example any of that so -- then the rest of us were devoted to licensing industry we have two offices in San Diego right downtown in the state building and then also in the city of San Marcos -- we have twenty four offices around the state and our our goal is to or regulatory philosophy you put it better I suppose is trying to get good people in business for trying to help them stay in business and comply with the difficult laws that they face and we're we're going to crack down on people who make the industry look bad because they are abusing alcohol and encouraging others to do so and running criminal enterprises in around our establishments it's a tiny little group of people but it's the kind of people they can give all of our industries of as a bad name and not something we want for all the obvious reasons -- the being under the tight house issues -- coming out of prohibition every state adopted tied house losses sensually divide industry into three groups manufacturers which would be wine makers on wine grape growers -- the distributors and and wholesalers who essentially take of manufactured product who then distributed to retailers or the third tears over the years many many exceptions have grown so our code has gone from like this stick to this there -- in every single year each of the you probably have someone who wants a tight house exception coming to your office -- asking for and why it's a wonderful idea in a lot of them really are wonderful ideas -- but it's it's created a situation where our laws we have become enormously complex traditionally distilled spirits are the most are the most closely regulated because of their intoxicating of fact -- beer next so mostly because of the history of how it developed in prohibition it was really the vat and distilled spirits almost to a lesser degree were were some of the biggest concerns in terms of abuse of alcohol in the beginning of the end of the twentieth century arm and then wine has a special place and even though in some ways the laws of the most complex related to wine it's because you really have the most exceptions from the tide health system right so you can actually operate as distributors you can distribute your own lines you can just read other people's winds most manufacturers are either not allowed to hold retail licenses at all or with rarely very narrow exceptions wine makers actually can hold -- retail licenses in a variety of forms with some limitations but generally you can operate restaurants -- and you can operate off sale you can operate liquor stores a again with with with various -- to them but I think that's largely the the exceptions for one have largely been because it's been let it was less of a concern in terms of alcohol abuse historically and then your industry has just done a fabulous job of promoting itself and promoting wind as food and part of lifestyle as opposed to something that's primarily intoxicating that is a huge achievement for California wine supports and it's something that you need to preserve and continue always important to emphasize the value and what you do and what you bring to California -- the other to the other -- parts of the manufacturing sector certain sector of not traditionally been as effective but but they're getting their rights so craft beer for example ten years ago Joe off pretty fledgling industry and now largely due to pioneers in San Diego actually as opposed to just alcohol as a commodity right and distilled spirits are are starting to come along there's a crafty still movement in California that is still in its relatively nascent stages but -- there is a mention of the joint tasting rooms with beer and wine and thanks to ms act we are curry there will now be craft distillers in their group so you're now going to have these up potential for some really fantastic locations where you're going to have the three core three types of our call with craft orientation there's a place in Sacramento right now to is developing a space like that and they're gonna have also all these craft kitchens along with it so here is small business at its best here is an ability to actually bring us all together in a way that promotes again California food lifestyle and the place of alcohol in that in incredibly responsible and and forward looking way so that is that is great -- other things however are a little more confusing for wineries such as marketing that's true for all industries very -- it's a very difficult land say to get your arms around because there's all kinds of prohibitions on primarily retailers and manufacturers advertising together to me we've made of right we've made a variety of exceptions their winemaker dinners there's the abilities of wine makers to provide tastings at retail outlets -- but again this goes back to the the history of tied house in the sense that one of the evils of of prior prohibition was pumping cheap alcohol all kinds advertising it to be primarily poor communities and creating tremendous alcohol abuse problems so those laws still exists today and and we need to take a better look though at how they're changing and evolving in ways that actually make work don't encourage access a good example just plain social media right so right now you can post the names of retailers so they can find your wine but you can't allow anyone to then take a picture of themselves out a retailer and post on your website and now it has to do with prohibitions between a about the ability of a manufacturer to advertise for retailers not really what was intended -- and something we should be looking at to make that less confusing more intuitive for people but but if someone of the nature of the tide health system in the exceptions have been made -- it's just complicated but were really there to help people get in front of that if you have challenges in your industry should come talk to us we can find solutions for you because are you generally ways to make things work the don't raise those kinds of concerns for us -- as a secondary I want to mention in terms of all being issues of concern to the industry all of our call industry is by twenty twenty one you're gonna have to have all the servers in your tasting rooms trained in responsible beverage service that's going to be true for all servers in all aspects of the industry in California we estimate it's anywhere between eight hundred thousand a million people which is really -- just a staggering number but it just goes to show the size of our hospitality industry -- it if the law rose out of a terrible thing that actually Kerr down here on a camp Pendleton a marine gotten this car and it really really drunk anyone often he killed three medical students and critically injured another one -- and so what out of that effort was the kind of thing that really pushed over the efforts to have responsible beverage service has a right now though we're developing regulations were trying to make it as easy for you as possible we know you have to keep track of tons and tons of government requirements we're trying to make an automated system for you that'll minimize the administrative slash bureaucratic burden and then the final thing I just want to mention is cannabis -- lots of lots of stories in the news all the time about people putting cannabis and whine about people having wine and Candice pairing dinners -- all that is entirely unlawful that you can have cannabis now call together which got to do in the privacy your own home you cannot have it in any public establishment -- what I would say about the stories about cannabis and wine cannabis and beer cannabis now culturally the tend to be a little over blown in the sense that for every ten complaints we get we go out look at -- maybe one anyone's actually doing something so I think the industry has been really responsible I think they understand that probably not a good long term business model to mix these two narcotics in essence together and keep them separate so we're we're really trying to provide people guidance -- some in the industry of come with to us with ideas about de alkyl alcohol Ising things there are ways to do that if that's what you want to do and make it legal again we're here to help you on that but generally our philosophy is cannabis now call should be separate so thank you known great job travels with I know we're gonna of questions here just a bit so we've heard from an individual Ventnor we've heard from the state now we're gonna be hearing from association about -- all issues of regulations and rules we're grateful that Mr McDonald is here he's the president of the association of African American men years he also is an owner and wine maker of vision sellers miss McDonald we're grateful that you took the time to be here welcome -- you have five to seven minutes in the for sure Sir thank you everyone for inviting us to take part in this -- one for discussion -- does a couple errors on the back of the sheet where it says winemaker an owner of vision sellers I'm married to miss little you don't own anything so I -- I make all the ones who vision sellers were you that don't know about vision sellers you can watch the del Mar if you get a and you can get aye why is there -- but I'm here base so talk about the association of African American then this is a new wine dinner is anyone is all over the country and as I would across the country doing these wind and as I got back home and I was really excited one day and I says the national us you know wanting something going on here and she's is what you're talking about a so you know just got to swing into North Carolina Alabama and Texas and there was no African Americans in my dinner I'm Anne my Danish and she looked at me and she says well hunting there's not any in California Inyo dinner so it got me to thinking about you know why so talk to a couple buddies in two thousand and two thousand and I kept going talking about it and I got together with some guys and we start at the association of African Americans in the nation yes folks it's not a black thing yesterday more people's to drink wine quite frankly I don't care who won a drink I just want people to enjoy a glass of wine so I put together this group with the idea that we're going to spend time in the African American community to talk about why and consumption of wine and I think you put it very bluntly here not red fox report not that type of stuff when I'm talking about you know Ryan did you can enjoy on a daily basis or weekly basis will every other day or whatever you I and I looked at it I thought the wind was really small business back when I was really getting going at this stuff really snobby it was kind of a little actually and I'm just going to give you my opinion I don't care if you have with eighteen point five Zinfandel which will catfish topical issue -- money to spend with that concept -- we started this group and we do things that can Harlem of Philadelphia south Dallas one is points throughout the country to get more African American to appreciate wine it is a five oh one C. six organization and bass -- what the mission of the organization is to get more folks understand line I'm a great grow -- and I'm economic bottom line and I want to take that information that I have along with the other members of the association and share that information with others who are trying to get into the wind business now some time you may reach up and it says -- mac and the other African American have to work harder to accomplish their goals I don't agree with that I think anybody in this business you better be able to work hard I don't care who you are high small you on big your you gotta work real hard you may have to work a little bit harder -- as a small and wondering -- because of the challenge for the association of American business is how find out into the market that's been a lot of time out there yep yep he was out there that know what they're doing -- you distributors still -- well take you around unless you produce a lot of on an even bigger really having a product you know just to do that traveling feeling all when you're going to let you know that type of stuff you know so I got a rules you know tell them okay market would you go to pick Mullin running around a lot of food and I'm a beginner so I'm trying to get that the into the -- African American associate to the Afghan association for people who want to get in the business a little understand those rules and if I was his instrument honor thousand conditions I would bring you don't either because they have a lot of expense in a lot of you build your brand so the idea that I'm trying to do with the association is come together as a group and then all for these distributors you know thirty forty thousand cases are wrong and then they may want to put some effort like has market aligned with a lot of us Senate on yeah I want to hear nine and June you know when slow was felt that they were kind of free and I kind of keep that in mind just to have withdrawal cam this summer we've been able in the past to send some student Chau -- you know for those troops middle class is just about perfect okay but there are other colleges and I'm working with you know a Texas tech and what taxes moderation over to where you can go to those classes and learning about wine and then you'd be more than happy to be more successful this to talk business on here and all my men have talked about these rules and regulations you know I don't know that that's what we thought may compress drummer could ripple and done a bird is because it was in the neighborhood thank you for explaining that can make a lot of balls anymore another time I'll be around to chat with you about the association of American business and how may be able to assist us -- on here I got a good and then I will listen thank you for your time eighty so much as Madonna we're grateful you're here nice job today thank you would like to go to open it up to the committee to be able to ask any questions or if you have any comments who would like to be able leaders saw I'll be more than happy to do that our culture so I'm gonna ask a couple questions -- Linda I really appreciate you telling me before we met earlier and also express -- well how you work with UC Davis online classes I was not aware of that and I live eleven miles from UC Davis so could you show just a little bit -- how that works do you -- you know I was just thinking a Mister macdonald is a good way for maybe some of his people to be interested in getting into wine is being able to use the online -- classes and I think that's really -- so how that work well it works is that you know we require the the the person to go to the class now we didn't do this stuff for start go to the class once they complete a class then we reimburse that money back because you know we we did just want to pay somebody some money and they decide they want to go to class so that's that's how how that works but what we we found in the past that it is very very hard to find you know African Americans in a position to even attend those classes because the the kind of friend of the business -- overall -- when I do these classes and all these community they think this is still a snobby gaming so when we got all the chain that snob in this is a wine and that's what I go to the philosophy is your money and whatever you want to have with your line that's your money you spent the way you want Linda how do you do the apprentice approach apprenticeship program as well okay a let us start with the UC Davis op which was is a wonderful resource for all of us and internationally -- the online program they have is is the one makers certificate program -- which is out a wonderful vehicle for people who yes such as myself living not near UC Davis having a job and family at home -- to be able to access that knowledge and information through the on line venue and and the subsequent chat sessions that go with that with that fellow class members and then you people from all over the world -- is part of that ideas and information and and really develop some some friendships that way too so I I was if -- if should we travel to Chile Argentina as we could I could email one of my classmates and we can connect up and so you build some collegiality there as well is as it being a wonderful -- source of information -- those classes for that why makers to the care program are fairly pricey -- but the but you pay for it did the ease of accessibility for that I think other venues where people can get similar information would be -- currently through University has in town here has a program for wine business and they go they look at the business aspect of that starting to integrate a couple of hands on classes -- with a little bit of information and exposure to wind production but then again our community college system -- is is really I think that pretty much the hot bed for ease of accessibility expense -- and that's that's what -- our apprenticeship program is working to to build into besides having the apprenticeship itself to start building in viticulture and wine production classes one of our community colleges mayor coast up in in north county -- has had a one production and that a culture class there for a number of years now and -- they they they are regularly full classes so it there there is a need beyond people that are looking for the work force we have quite a number a large number of home wine makers home backyard wine grape growers who who really have some substantial their own grapes and make their own wine and and always want to learn more too so I think -- we have lots of accessibility for people on all levels with millions of the complaints at travel Smith did you are chairman of this one as well that's okay okay center dot so I've got one for you Smith OB you talked about the complexity of of of the the rules and regulations of a that I think the the -- the of people here would be interested in hearing what you do to -- -- inform licensees of new rules and regulations or existing or what could existing licensees due to stay up on it themselves so new regulations we really don't have because we don't have a right we haven't had a regulatory unit many years so we've sort of call them out here and there it's really something that is lacking I think that in this coming budget year -- we're gonna probably get the funding to do that because there's a lot of things we could do -- proactively that would actually be beneficial for the industry unlike most regulatory agencies designed to stop people from doing things that actually to help them do things because in California law you can't do anything unless there's a statute that's been California alcohol you cannot do anything lesser stature rule that says you can so like with the social media I think there's lots of things we could put in place would make that workable for them -- but in terms of issues where we think things are difficult we do issue industry advisories so we've been -- as the as the statues have a vault that we have -- been issuing advisories on cannabis for example just to make it really clear you cannot do virtually anything on an alcohol premise with cannabis and vice versa available -- to licensees -- particularly we we can't just give day today advice but as particularly when there is issues that are impacting the industry -- we try to work with them and then let the industry groups no we work really closely with the one is to with the family wine growers and then we're also really excess will come talking to people servi time I'm at one of these things I always say I will come speak to your group if you want me to I'm gonna be in Monterey to speak to the Monterey vendors next month so that's something that's really great because we can put out information but also we we just learned a ton of stuff right every time we go out and we're in the field actually talk to people so so take to the long way of getting to we do as much as we can we should we should we're we're not institutionally set up to be a systematic as we should and that's something we're working on I think it's transit issue questions comments please mentally of a really quick -- my district includes fall broke pama valley center Escondido parts of simple school family in San Diego county which we're seeing more more people getting into growing grapes and when I had attended the San Diego vintners association meeting a little while back things that came up because more and more people cutting down the row of a kind of trees and now starting the plan vineyards because of the cost of water especially I'm and I I remember and I don't remember all of it but the vendor's association is very active in helping people figure out how to navigate you know setting up their winery coming out to visit them can you speak a little bit about that like how you encourage people when they have you know an interest in starting up in your well that's one thing that we that's that's a real positive about being part of San Diego county veterans association is because we are spread all over the county there's somebody that's going to be next door who wants to start up or just thinking about it -- has a friend and we are all of our members were all glad to share our our information and experience in and help introduce people to others that may be able to help give additional help and support -- but we're we're very -- supportive association and and work cooperatively together to try to to make these things happen we also bring in outside speakers talk about -- putting in vineyards and add vineyard S. practices for for vineyards and and wineries up because I mission is to make sure that aye wineries in San Diego county are making it the best wine that we can and keep moving that toward increasing quality and and having people have a real positive experience streaking San Diego winds and seek them out to hope I answered your question I wanna thank you to the panelists for a great testimony to this not might for tech this is not my area of expertise but -- but yeah I mean all you adding really human element to help books of myself understand is an industry actually the question for the doctor if I may and nobody puts on a taught in a tough spot I know because sometimes be difficult Astarte directors like nature of your business you're kind of generally in those right I just wanna make the observation in my district offices in our state building here in San Diego I see many of your staff that worked extremely hard they're very responsive to my district staff us some of whom are here today -- on issues of great concern we have about alcohol consumption in the seventy eight gas and district Pacific beach north park -- I know oftentimes it that is initially felt by who may have complaints or concerns of from a budgetary perspective what would you hope that we could advocate for as legislators I know there's a lot of calm conversations within the caucus on what we have is party you sort of alluded to it but he put a finer point on what we do from resources you think would be helpful -- to making sure the department can be -- with the with the to the workers who are clearly working really hard -- are well supported answered the constituents that we serve field was supported by the department as well -- so so are our biggest challenge has been -- really modernizing our electronic services we finally got money to go through the state approval processes to to have online payments members with information that's automated and members of prevention community one understand what's going on of right now we process a hundred and fifty thousand personal physical touch paper checks a year because we can't accept electronic payment which is just embarrassing at annoying in a Paris and center on so I think we're on the right road to that -- but we also just on the enforcement level some of that to make it more efficient we just don't we just don't have enough people -- but but I I don't want to sound like a typical you know state bureaucrat always complains about resources but I I really do think finally we've gained some traction with our control agencies because as I said at the outset you know we have to more people than we had in nineteen fifty five and we have now you know about three times as many people in the state and more than twice as many licenses so we're really trying to modernize our balls I don't think it's that much bigger than we are it's not some gigantic growth curve -- but it's really in the areas of trying to automate mourn for spent and then some -- field staff particularly I would say in San Diego and Los Angeles where we have -- as no just of a very involved community we we work for the pro tem as well really well -- very involved community both in terms of entrepreneurs but also in terms of people concerned about neighborhoods lots of protest lots of complexity same thing in Los Angeles so that's really what we're trying to get to is is is us a real to think is relatively slight growth it'll actually modernize is in a position us to be left behind the curve and exits quick follow up even if you on the path to kind of getting the automation that would be reflective of the state of Silicon Valley and -- what would actually cost to get their image on the past but like was how much will it takes that sound like a one time costs are now we have a as a seventy five million dollar annual budget and what we've real what we're projecting that out to be is really in the neighborhood of about a million dollars so it's it's it's not huge dollars it's just -- we we've just been as you know everyone in state government have been relatively Oster austere is that authorizes that on money an author on no but it will be we we've gotten to the project we're now going to have numbers that come out of that stage to the power process sorry for anyone outside of Sacramento doesn't know what powers but it's the state approval process for project so we will have a budget come out about that we hope is going to make it into the January budget okay please keep us posted I spend any happy advocate for that the budget process step and keep very much when your comments and I have all those communities are very active in concerned by neighborhoods never ever going to complain about a wine -- bar so thank you to the industry for being good actors and and and risk the neighborhoods where -- this is often a sense of such a big the switch is quick question take it take a look at wineries and now they're looking at additional revenue input into looking at -- developing spirits on -- with a different license so you have one family that may be operating a winery and then also -- establishing a business that is running spirits and then they have a spirit club like they want to be able to have a wine club but they can't ship spirits like they can ship wine in state any thoughts on that the state -- not to a club at the mall right well that's right that you have not really looked at it closely but there are -- there are generally what work just concerned about mostly is that -- we were just not putting them in the hands of minors etcetera people should not have them sure I'm spirits also just have had a much more traditional distribution system notes largely because of the potential danger of of spirits that are -- are poisonous for lack of a better way to put it there's a good reason why one of the one of the best things about the three tier system is we just don't have a lot of alcohol poisoning based on -- defective alcohol in this country and one of the arguments for that is that we actually have a distribution system that prevents retailers from getting -- tainted alcohol now but direct shipment of course is another thing altogether but I think that I also in individual right now in a at will belabor the point and go off line on this but if if I wanted if I belong to a spear club though like a wine club I can go in and buy for example four to six bottles and walk out with them -- but I can't get a mailed to my house so that's just -- a piece -- if your club -- but anyway it's it's it's a conversation for another day do understand should be anything you're hearing on the federal level that's one of the biggest challenges that we hear from vendors shipping out of state I'm in it is become incredibly challenging with UPS and fed ex except ra anything you're hearing on the federal level that -- will there currently is a challenge to -- to the titles laws that in the U. S. Supreme Court that may actually change the way some of this works I am myself -- defendant just by virtue of my position of case in Sacramento were an out of state shippers trying to ship in the California and ways that we don't allow their trying to ship one -- the the part of the problem of course is that under the twenty first amendment states can do whatever they want they don't have to allow shipping at all or they can restricted anywhere they want the ability to actually standardized out is probably not something the federal government can impose what would be a better approach would be to try to get the state's to actually come to agreements themselves to make it simpler so that we don't have to go through middle men who are specialists to take away a lot of your money by by being in the business of that because especially with wine again not a product were is much concerned about the safety of the product that as we are with spirits and told to a slightly lesser degree here thank you so much stricter just two last questions -- madam chair Mister chair is a to miss make Williams and then -- Smith Donald can you just give us an overview Q. Sealy -- is your when you for example like a custom crush facility where you're buying fruit are you buying just use would love to be a they give us a quick overview on that and then Mister Donald if you can just give us a -- overview in California how many African American wine makers would you say there are here in California even if it's in a total -- as well as those who are -- involved in growing as well please Mr claims -- except as well winery and we buy grapes and and do all the the question manufactured production in are bonded licensed facility -- and I believe that that is the the operating procedure for most wineries in the county at as opposed to say a custom crash backyard growers are joining together with their friends and neighbors I think they're starting to advance to a point where they are looking for something such as a a custom crush facility for themselves their and their group so I I believe that is at in expanded market here in in the county I can think of one the two wineries that are are working towards that are planning to work towards that it at this time so I I think that's going to be a growing area for us here in San Diego as well Turkish a question about after American growers gonna give you an estimate about twenty five in as about thirty years so -- growers with real small growers you know for example you know Michelle and I you know we we we just from about twelve acres of up a PMR approaches are most my print from other growers I like it that way because I don't have all of my aches and wind up you know so -- we -- we -- we think the Sonoma napa county is really really expensive and and can say lets you have a whole pocket full of money you know this is a tough business to last two days and then plan in a payment could four years or so before you get anything off of it if you getting hit off of it and you can make world class wine but you got to sell it so it takes a lot of dollars to get into that so collectively what we trying to do is come together so we can help each other out and help the wine industry on the to save time so that's the best dressed to go look around and look at all the stuff is going on mowing the folks popping up in that is both a smoke met right under my nose and African American and I only over there are are probably get ten calls a week or ten emails a week -- someone in some parts of the country want to grow grapes and you know what the hell I know about what type of Georgia you know I have no idea so -- but which is of course a growing business operation question for in okay thank you all very much panel now I really appreciate your participation thank you the second panel MailChimp smelter and fill long senior weather coming up I think that what -- -- Mister macdonald up about the expense and everything -- of what they say in napa is you know how to -- a small fortune in the wine business start with a large one yes -- he spot on commodity get let's let's lighten up here a little bit okay thank you so it's it's my great pleasure to welcome by the next panel it will be discussing years how federal law is impacting is important topic our first senior and he's -- wine maker and founder of logic hit longevity winds -- feel long begin his journey making wine in the garage with his wife Debra now with -- close to two decades of wine making experience in a list of awards too long to Pratt bill continues his journey constantly improving he says in the business of wine making the minute you think you know what all it's time to get out that's kind of the way it is a politics to the Livermore valley in two thousand six other longevity label using other facilities it was only a matter of time before production -- was moved out -- from other facilities to longevity is own facility in the Livermore valley -- yearly production ranges from five hundred to three thousand cases fill also serves as incoming vice president of the association of African American bidders bill thank you very much for being here and what do you get started will thank you thank you everybody for having me Assemblymembers senators -- is great to be here so good morning little bit about some of the challenges were facing it really relates to small business in direct to consumer shipping and I know this is such a pond earlier the bottom line is every single state in our country has a different set of rules permits and regulations for shipping wine into their state for direct to consumers if you want to ship wholesale into their state and have your one distributed to the state that's another set of rules regulations permits registering if you were just to try to file literally permits in every state that allow shipping into in the United States it would be about fifteen thousand dollars out of your pocket just to get the permit is then you will have to do up to for reports per year per state the compliance work is an absolute night so that being said it was brought up earlier I to use readership veto shipper is kind of a god send because veto shipper is a third party shipper that literally garner's all of those permits in all of the states that allow shipping to and they add as they can as they become available for a small fee it it actually is a fairly small fee I believe it's four seventy five order and seventy five cents per bottle is their feet in essence they become your distributor they distribute your wine and it's kinda cool I moved I have a little bit of web background you build a store there appears on your website that looks like your website through code you're not really making the sale very making the sale so they're taking the order they're taking the revenue and their depositing in your account your portion minus their fee every two weeks so they're kind of a god send but there are things on the horizon there are going to make it difficult for all of us especially small business year is a new all on line age verification law there is more than just today you can't sign for wine if you're under twenty one periods on every box it goes out you have to pay the additional fee to whoever using to get the signature there's a new law that is asking for the age to be verified at the point of sale online that's software starts at around seven to nine thousand dollars I can't afford that the what that's going to do that's going to give veto should for they're going to have to purchase it because they're making the sales but then that obviously trickles down to the smaller wineries and we're gonna our fees are going to go off so there's that's making it difficult for direct to consumer sales in general and not everybody knows about veto ship rear -- once the don't are still going state by state trying to procure Lysons wanted time and trying to keep up with the compliance paperwork -- before we had of Reno shipper we had licenses in other states as well it doesn't matter if you don't sell a bottle of wine usually have to file the paperwork every quarter so they are kind of a god send there are challenges coming for all of us there's also new move with the started in New York that possibly wineries websites need to be AT a compliance right okay -- I understand eighty a need they have their needs but I don't think it's tops with wineries doesn't that become every website on the planet so we do have our challenges helping with that in the end for us we have phone it is actually easier to ship to other countries than it is to ship to other states UPS is partnering with small businesses and wineries to help remove them in offering all sorts of special services to small people who want to ship across the sea and we are moving in that direction because we don't have to have a life state we don't have to register we have to pay taxes and -- okay but you're doing that per country not every time for state four times a year so the director consumers will be coming it never having a difficult area for us and a challenge for us to get our product to consumers are the solutions beyond veto shipper I think it was mentioned earlier if stage could just come together and talk maybe that would help -- also want to thank the ABC for the tax break I mean come on thank you for the excise taxes that's a big help that is obviously affecting is even across the board is this whole terror finger to work it's -- affecting us in both directions most of the small business small wineries use imported glass usually from China as of September the chair of his ten percent on imported glass from China as of January one is going up to twenty five percent that not only drives my Costa even my glass supplier is wondering if he's going to be able to stay in business with those types of in of terrace imposed on glass so situation three we we can't get our glass for what we used to and if we want to ship to try to -- by the way there's a fifteen percent tariff on that too so I think for the small business the direction things are going is becoming more more difficult when you're a large corporation in this industry to look you you can source your glass worldwide I mean you can go wherever will just go to this country is that we can't we can't do that the that's just not feasible for us so I know someone contemplating I'm not understood of listen server issues in getting our product to customers and the process in the regulations to do that -- I also heard mentioned earlier looking to go through through the names about workman's comp insurance which we're fortunate to have in our water but there was a whole big who our Valley they shot the winery down they used to use volunteers and someone got hurt an unfortunate the owner not the best out of to the world didn't cooperate and he got shut down after about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in fines I think there needs to be a way we can offer workers comp insurance to volunteers is a huge the industry's use volunteers for hundreds of years and all the sudden one answer without one it's gone instead of finding a way to make it work it just has gone away so anyway those are my main issues -- little bit about the winery you know we're we were the first urban winery in the Livermore valley now somewhere between sixty and seventy -- our fruit or close truths across the street from will have to go that far for a ninety five percent or -- Livermore alkylated but winds and we're just mom pop were between three five thousand cases and trying to get our product out there -- we also use readership for we do a private label for show business the we use in our support for her wind as well so I think there there's some hope but there's some challenges as well so thank you for your time thank you this long will be -- taking questions after the next speaker speaks in that speakers Tim smelter Tim has been the vice president the California state relations for the wine institute since two thousand sixteen previously seltzer served as the White institute's director of legislative and regulatory affairs for eight years his most recent focus has been the environmental and labor policy areas needs also advocated in the alcohol beverage control law and taxation policy areas arenas use me -- earlier in his career Schmelzer service the manager of the state legislative policy for southern California Edison and the legislative director for the California energy commission in total he has over twenty seven years of experience working with California state government smelter was born in California lives with his wife Karen and three children in Sacramento welcome to hold my very good well -- thank you you and -- also great to see you -- some remember Gloria and Waldron -- so as you know you've got the vice president for California state relations here for wine institute to talk to you about federal and international trade so go a little little easy on me aware but -- one institutes California wineries -- we have winery and associated business members -- throughout the state and -- advocates on all levels her today somebody on wine institute is is actively working on those issues for example my colleague -- Steve gross -- has a -- phalanx of folks working in every state in our country -- helping to -- work with these like direct to consumer shipping issues -- and that you mention sometimes it's easier to ship overseas than in the state in the -- state and quick comment on that up one institute -- was -- one of the big -- organizations that help with the formation of an organization called the worldwide trade group at goals to get member countries together to kind of standardized related to the import and export of our wine products could look at to do within the United States of for example so to talk to about -- today is some of the issues once it's active on -- in Congress and also -- touch upon just a few the international trade issues are gonna be by no means -- all of them but I I thought I just point out some of the highlights priority right now is -- to extend the provisions of the act -- this past of just over a year ago and represented the first time in eighty years reduction for our another unfortunate part of getting that done is we had to -- to compromise essentially and take a two year -- extension when we are pushing for -- permanence -- so we are to get in place legislation that would extend that permanently bipartisan support for this and it's really a matter and Congress of finding the right vehicle an opportunity to make it happen -- this is something that -- I think you all can help with and talking to your your areas and encourage them to sign on -- one of things that allowed us to get that legislation passed in the first place with a huge number of co sponsors we had in both the Congress and Senate -- we did not have every California member signed on to that and it's a goal of ours to get their -- I know some of them are like Mike Thompson representing several of you guys he's obviously signed on to that but -- -- anyway it's -- whatever help you can do to push your -- congresspersons to support that we don't think that it's -- of any consequence -- relative to the -- it passed the bill that the house flip to Democrats of this issue and in fact -- have the we don't know if that's a plus is gonna end up speaker probably but -- with Kevin McCarty and and that's politically in the two leaders in Congress both being from California that can't hurt our chances -- secondly hard for a while now -- on the farm bills -- we think that there is a -- very decent chance of the farm bill -- get extended another -- five years during the lame duck session and -- the couple programs in there that are -- -- consequence to the wine industry are the market access program commonly referred to as the map program funds -- the export -- programs the -- bummer with that is -- we've lost a lot of funding from that program over time Congress where more and more people of that have been applying for that funding -- we once were receiving -- fifteen million dollars a year for that program for to support the export of United States wine and -- we're going to consider to win this year if we get eight so it's it's been pretty dramatically reduced over over time -- that's something that we really hope to see more funding into that program in the future -- it's only the entire map programs only two hundred million dollars which is a very small piece of the overall farm bill context for that by the way the overall funding for that hundred million dollars that is still less than and the European Union has just for one so that's the in there's many other countries that export one as well so it -- compared to other countries -- you know I I think our country frankly could stand a step up a little bit in this in this area -- the other element that's -- importance -- for us out of this farm bill is specialty crop funding -- this -- fortunately has received a bump in funding in recent years it's likely remain flat and the new farm bill that given our games in the recent past -- that's something that we're not overly concerned about -- the to the wine industry they get supported for that are -- in particular -- work on -- past -- TV quiz Pierce's disease class wing sharpshooter program of winegrowers throughout the state small increase -- for that program this year -- which would be -- pretty happy about million dollars -- into that program that's in addition to money that -- growers themselves put in -- through an assessment crop block program is a -- importance to the wine industry and in particular -- our work on the California's sustainable a lot of -- work to -- develop that program into -- the ability to -- influence regulation and doing research to support -- new sustainability projects is funded from there and we had a -- nice string it success in getting getting those farm bill -- gets done and this lame duck session great -- at a minimum -- we -- look to get that -- work done by July first which is -- really kind of art timeline when that funding is going to become critical for us to -- international issues -- the -- now after -- the new agreement called the -- ischemic this is I cannot get it U. S. Mexico Canada agreement the the key thing they screwed up here is given it city Akron and so anyway -- this is actually and -- when it's aye Reyes of of all places and -- this is something -- we are actually quite excited about -- this all some of the key issues -- we are having an trade -- you may not be aware of this but Cañada is actually the number one -- trade partner for U. S. wine and -- one of the key features huge to us is -- we had been fighting with British Columbia unfair trade practices in the ability of our winds to be placed on grocery store shelves in British Columbia and their practices and -- our access to the Canadian market will be greatly improved -- it doesn't solve all of our problems we have similar issues and Quebec and Ontario that to work to work on but the such an excellent president and -- we're we're quite pleased -- that this agreement occurred so was a real positive development for us and I think worthy of our industry support on a less positive note and and frankly there's nothing positive to say about it is been devastating and they're going to get worse -- before they get better -- to date our -- our members that ship into -- this growing market and now United States is the number one -- wine consuming -- country critics take that to within the next five to ten years so this is the market some days and because it's so painful -- this is becoming a system retailers are scheduled to go again soon to the point where -- with tax into before we even had a retest so we see a hundred percent markup this this -- to give you an idea what kind of disadvantaged with products so so beginning in January first -- in nineteen the correct percent this will be paying for every -- US one goes into China does it have a great this is for you to Australian sure the mount storage rooms and please tell us -- going into that country as well -- I just think it's a to -- for us I was sad development of construed to frankly see this one right now it's just so I wanted to mention we can sit situation thing to us and as number two -- export market for -- American line and when I say American line ninety percent of that is from California so I'm just be a nice when I say that's really California -- in any case -- with this break that situation some opportunities for for us -- the European Union -- has been difficult for for us to negotiate frankly -- the protective practices -- to protect their industries -- California is the number four one market in the world right as far as production -- France Italy and Spain are the ones that are ahead of us so it's once the brexit deal is ratified begin negotiations -- with United Kingdom directly and we can negotiate some -- better -- trade arrangements we now experience -- through the European Union so -- believe it or not there's it's some positive -- aspect to that -- for our for our product -- even though I know you know think what you will about it in general there is an opportunity there for for California I believe or not -- and lastly I want to mention will turn positive for us is of the United States is negotiations with Japan -- this is the number for export market -- for -- wine products was one where it was a real lost opportunity for us -- when the trump administration chose not to go forward with the -- Pacific trade -- agreement -- we had negotiated -- the terrace our products in a number of Pacific Rim countries -- when that agreement was torn up we lost that deal essentially and to pay fairly steep terrace in Japan while those -- Chile New Zealand Australia -- are all going to be hitting zero on that terrace market deal that we were frankly -- one of the authors of originally for us -- with United States into these negotiations and we're going to be pushing hard be to be eliminated completely so we can be on equal footing that important market for us and so that was all I had for you -- I can answer questions on this and also in the area of my actual expertise which is California policy for question appears whose number three dang it would be -- so we have Canada Japan U. K. -- you know it it's -- the E. U. yeah very good yes very good any other questions of either yes well maybe you can give us some highlights of what we have to look forward to this year and are legislative session as far as things you're advocating for -- well a lot of issues that that we're working on our -- have been touched upon by some of the folks that preceded me -- issue of -- waste discharge which was was brought up here something that -- legislature's going to get involved in but -- wine institute in and notably those -- San Diego county farm bureau has been a part in these talks is working on a new statewide -- waste discharge requirements -- for wine -- this is a tricky situation because you got to get it right but -- wanted to keep beneficiaries of this we believe is going to be a smaller wineries and giving them -- essentially administrative compliance and a formal regulatory recognition of the indeed very low risk that they pose to the environment so that's something we're working on the on the regulatory front a very difficult situation right now -- that arose out of a Santa Barbara that it's -- has the ability to impact -- wineries throughout the state as a condition of getting a fermentation tank -- approved was required to put on their fermentation tank -- emission control device add to capture ethanol which is a -- though very low reactive it says on precursor that's why they had jurisdiction in the matter of our concern -- is both the -- large costs associated with a almost negligible improvement in air quality but -- of greatest concern to us here is that putting any sort of duct work on top of -- your from mentor creates all sorts of problems for your wine maker -- the pressure in the fermentation tanks can affect one quality the potential for spoilage he even varietal integrity -- can be a risk here because these would all be tapped into the same -- control device so we have -- tremendous -- concerns about this issue -- we have in the legislature -- looking at potential solutions here we don't know what that's going to be but this is gonna be a major focus of ours -- in the legislature this year great -- center McGuire thank you so much interaction with longest day talk with us so if you don't mind doing a little bit of a deeper dive on the issue of the shipping and know that you're talking about individual property being able to work with service but has there been -- discussion about bringing small there's together to be able to go in it since is a coop to be able to do one contract talks about that because that that it seems to be an ongoing challenge the ball from cinema county the majority of wines are ten thousand cases -- lessons number county right so it's small mom and pops that are struggling to be able to -- figure out how to get there their product out -- through ship in there has been some discussion I was approached of actually becoming a distributor for several entities and as a distributor for law center several injuries then you assume the license in that state and let's just say you're doing it for general every rule there's ten licenses the don't need to be at through the A. B. C. of the lives of being a distributor and the complications of being a wider industry to the same time I think the ABC of more of that than I do -- but it would be a process of someone to do it is a of is it is a part of my business I mean I'm I'm I'm I'm cleaning up the president didn't hang nails should I really start distributing did to save that and again I think veto shipper is a is a godsend for all of us -- because it really eliminates a lot of that thank you great I'm not seeing any more questions I want to thank you both for being here today and for your testimony answer those questions we're moving now to public comment I anybody from the public anybody in the audience wishing to -- ask a question we've got the microphone right in front this is your opportunity to tell your legislators what you like what you don't like job well you know we're gonna get out of here on time that's one thing will look at I really appreciate the opportunity -- all of us do to be able to be here to listen to the industry this the first you know most the time in our hearings for the select committee on wine we're either and napa or so the home -- and you know we have a big California wine industry and I know that all three of our chairs really wanted to make sure that -- growers and winery owners throughout the state of California outside of those areas no whatever stay at -- that we get it and that we have significant wind industries all throughout the state and what you think is very very important us and so I really like to take this opportunity to thank you all aye and now what we're gonna do is center McGuire would you like to make some party comments thank you so much and Mister chair I just want to say thank you all the for hanging with us today -- in this beautiful San Diego whether -- as -- the good to some members said in all seriousness wonderful presentation by each of our panelists have been able to present whether you are an individual one we honor and association had indoor -- brokers in the government we are grateful for your work thank you all for being here in another special thanks to the assembly side for all the special services -- as well as a single now where curry's team who took a charge of this hearing very grateful for your work on this and I think you Mister died and and item leaders well so -- what I enjoy about these that I listen and -- we've had numerous -- opportunities to talk about the wanted to see for some time and we did do some bills last year -- for farmworkers small farmer farmers program to the CDFA they just actually hired somebody that's going to now take over that position so there are some things that are out there that I hope that you'll take advantage of through the California department of food nag it's a great program -- it's for the smaller farmers because I to a small farmer I small I'm fine with my brothers eighty acres which is not much of walnuts but you still have a lot of paperwork and I have one employee and after my father passed -- I was all of a sudden sitting there thought the paperwork because he hoarded his paperwork and his checkbook for years but we went through things and I was us -- just flabbergasted about how many pieces of paper a small businesses to go through and so -- I will continue as well as my colleagues is to make sure that we can -- have our small businesses or small farmers thrive in I think we've made some headway on some of the legislation that we have run we did the bill this past year with the a co location of breweries and wineries and in my community it has tripled their income and -- spy the best thing that could happen to a small business in a real community so -- you know keep asking us the questions don't be shy you might know me man I want to speak today but we are here to listen and to hopefully make your lives better and to help the state of California in this industry so thank you very much for coming -- Marie thank you just briefly -- it's exciting that you are here in San Diego and we can kind of both a little bit about our our wine industry so even though the weather's not that well -- on behalf of the some Limón Gloria and myself representing San Diego county -- thank you for coming in as -- a chairwoman Aguilar Kerry said we are here we're going to continue working through the legislative session coming up so he and beginning of the year the first three months as opportune time to work with us to get legislation going so will you know will be happy to and to work with you thank you and I'm sure that -- I can speak for assembly member chairman gray who's on his sick bed that he's been watching every step of the way and consumed all this information is right there with us as he always is business -- your from his district so with that would like to thank everybody all the staff assembly and Senate really job well done thank you for putting this on -- Democrats and we're gonna do you can hammer down
