ONE A BY SO PAD CAN COAST RESOURCE INTO LEVEL- MAN PRO TEM WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CO- I APPRECIATE THE COURTESY OF BEING ABLE TO GO FIRST. I AM HERE TO PRESENT SB ONE AND NOT MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES I WILL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. COLLEAGUES WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE FROM DISASTERS LIKE MASSIVE WILDFIRES WERE WE'VE LOST HUNDREDS OF LIVES SAME PROPERTY DESTROYED AND SUFFERED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER COST TO LONG PERIODS OF SEVERE DROUGHT. WHICH HAS AFFECTED ALSO OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO GROW FOOD. I'M A CHANGES ALSO ACUTELY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S COAST AND MORE SUBTLE IN DAMAGING WAYS THROUGH SEA LEVEL RISE. TURNING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE CALIFORNIA COULD EXPERIENCE THE LEVEL RISE OF HALF A FOOT IN THE NEXT DECADE AND UP TO SEVEN FEET BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. ATIKA EVENTS LIKE COASTAL STORMS AND KING TIDES WILL AMPLIFY THESE EFFECTS. THESE CHANGES COULD VERY WELL INAND DAY LOW LYING COASTAL AREAS AND EVEN INLAND AREAS. WREAKING HAVOC ON BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT THE DEL MAR BELUS ARE ERODING AWAY A MAJOR REAL LINE IT'S THE SECOND BUSIEST RAIL LINE IN THE COUNTRY RUNS THROUGH THESE PLUS AND WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT REPAIR AND ATTENTION TO THE STATE THE ATTENTION. THE STATE IS IN DANGER OF NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE PEOPLE AND GOODS EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY. STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ONLY. EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING FOR AND ANTICIPATING SEA LEVEL RISE THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE COSTLY THE DAMAGE WILL BE IN FACT THE L. A. RECOMMENDS MORE FUNDING GREATER STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL COLLABORATION AND BETTER INFORMED PLANNING AND LAND USE DECISIONS TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE. SB ONE ESTABLISHES A STRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES NEW PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND PUBLIC AGENCY COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA LAW. FURTHERMORE SB ONE REQUIRES THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO ADOPT AND PERIODICALLY UPDATE STANDARDS FOR USE IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL COASTAL PLANNING IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY ASSESS AND MITIGATE SEA LEVEL RISE. SB ONE ALSO ESTABLISHES A NEW CROSS GOVERNMENT COLLABORATIVE TO ENSURE THE IMPACTS OF SEA LEVEL RISE ARE ANTICIPATED AND ADDRESSED BEYOND SIMPLY ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO BY OUR TRANSPORTATION AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCIES AND FINALLY. A PROVIDES NEW FUNDING CONTINGENT UPON APPROPRIATION IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET FOR STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN. FOR AND MITIGATE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. IN ADDRESSING SEA LEVEL RISE WE CANNOT FORGET ABOUT ADDRESSING OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL EXPANDS THE EXISTING CAL EPA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANT PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED FROM SEA LEVEL RISE HAVE A VOICE IN THE ACTIONS GOVERNMENT TAKES TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. SEALABLE RISES A PROBLEM I'VE SEEN TAKE ROOT IN MY COMMUNITIES AND THOSE OF MANY SENATORS ACROSS THE STATE. AND FINALLY I WANT TO DISABUSE YOU OF THE NOTION THAT THIS IS A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM FOR WEALTHY COASTAL ENCLAVES LIKE POTENTIALLY MALIBU ARE LAHORE YEAH. IN REALITY SEALEVEL RISE WILL DO MOST HARM IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD TO ADDRESS IT. COMMUNITIES LIKE IMPERIAL BEACH AND CHULA VISTA IN MY REGION. OF PORT WHY NINI AND MARINA IN OUR CENTRAL COAST AND MIL PAETUS AND CRESCENT CITY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR STATE. SB ONE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SEA LEVEL RISE. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK I HAVE ONE MAJOR WITNESS IN SUPPORT. SERUM IS ADDED WHO IS A COASTAL COMMISSIONER. AND AN EXPERT ON SEA LEVEL RISE- OF WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO HER AS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT BUT LET ME ANNOUNCE. NO PLEASE COME FORWARD. BUT LET ME ANNOUNCE THAT APPARENTLY THE PHONE NUMBER WASN'T CORRECT ON THE SCREEN. SO FAR IF YOU WISH TO ARE USED TO TELECONFERENCE BECAUSE WILL BE TAKING WITNESSES AFTER OF THIS PRESENTATION THE CORRECT NUMBER. IS. 844-291-6364. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR. AND THE CODE IS- SIX FIVE FOUR TWO EIGHT NINE SEVEN COMMISSIONER WELCOME TO THE- WHAT WHATEVER WORKS. THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS TERRY I'M INSIDE IT AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE- AS THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED I'VE STUDIED THE IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE ON SHORELINE AREAS. AND ADVOCATED FOR NEEDED POLICY REFORMS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. I ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. BY NOW THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MANY OF WHOM HAVE AUTHORED KEY RELATED BILLS ON THE TOPIC ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE REACH OF SEA LEVEL RISE. WE KNOW THAT IMPACTS WILL NOT HAPPEN SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY AS THE FAR OFF TIME HORIZONS OF TWENTY FIFTY AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED MIGHT IMPLY. BUT INSIDE IN AND YET PREDICTED EMERGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREME WEATHER AND ULTRA HIGH TIDE EVENTS. I WANT TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE IMPACTS TO UNDERSERVED OMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM COASTAL AREAS THROUGH STATE SANCTIONED EMINENT DOMAIN. RELEGATED TO AREAS VULNERABLE TO FLOODING THROUGH REDLINING AND FEDERAL HOUSING PROJECTS AND WHO LIVE IN LARGELY PARK POOR AREAS. SEA LEVEL RISE AND STATE ACTIONS OR IN ACTIONS WILL PERPETUATE INEQUITIES AND DISPARITIES THAT ALREADY EXIST IF WE DO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS LIKE THAT IN SB ONE. LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS AND THOSE WHO LIVE IN RENTAL UNITS IN PLACES LIKE TO LIVE IS TO IMPORT WHY NIIMI ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DISPLACED BY FLOODING AS COMPARED TO PROPERTY OWNERS BECAUSE THEY LACKED THE FUNDS TO REBUILD. AND HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER THEIR SAFETY. IN PLACES LIKE MARIN CITY IN ARCADIA RESIDENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO WORK OR CENTRAL SERVICES WHEN ROADS FLOOD. AND IN AREAS VULNERABLE TO SEA LEVEL RISE LIKE SAN PEDRO AND LONG BEACH SINCE THE WALLS WILL FURTHER REDUCE ACCESS TO COASTAL RECREATION AREAS. FOR LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS LIVING L. AND MAY ACCESS THE BEACH RARELY AND BYPASS BIKING OR WALKING. THEY CANNOT CREWS TO THE NEXT BEACH WHEN THE REGULAR SPOT IS FLOODED- RENDERED UNSAFE FOR USE. SB ONE WILL CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR TAKING ACTION BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. SB ONE AN AXE THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE SEA LEVEL RISE PROGRAM IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND ESTABLISHES FUNDING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES. TO PLAN FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. WOULD MAKE UP TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR ADAPTATION PREPAREDNESS WORK AND EXPLICITLY I'D C. LEVEL RISE TO THE EPA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANTS PROGRAM. SENDING CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT- GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE WILL ALLOW FUNDS TO BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH EXISTING CHANNELS ALLOWING US TO EXPEDITE THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. EVERY YEAR THAT WE DO NOT TAKE ACTION TO PREPARE STATE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. MEANS A SET OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHOICES LOST AND WE KNOW THAT THESE LOSSES WILL BE FELT MOST SHARPLY BY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE DOLLAR SPENT NOW ON PREPARING NASS WILL SAVE A SIX DOLLARS ON FUTURE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND TO LEARN YOUR VOICES TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL REFORM THIS SESSION. THE COMMISSION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS BELT AND LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUED WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE INCLUDING ON ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING TECHNICAL MOMENTS.

OUR WILL NOT THE MOTION TYSON EGGMAN FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YES MISTER JONES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NUMBER TIM I HEAR YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE SAME SIDE ON SEVERAL PROJECTS IN SAN DIEGO THAT HAVE BEEN FOR THAT WE'VE TRIED TO SUPPORT AND GET. DONE AND- THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS FRUSTRATED A LOT OF THOSE PARTS NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THEM AND- MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL CREATES AN ADDITIONAL. BUREAUCRACY A NEW GOVERNMENT PRIVACY WITH IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION- ARE YOU NOT CONSIDERED I'M CONCERNED AND I GUESS THE QUESTION ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED THAT THAT'S GOING TO FURTHER FRUSTRATE GOOD PROJECTS WHEN THEY COMMON AND WANT TO GET PATH A BUILT IN AD OR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE FIVE. TESTING THANK M. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION I OF COURSE LIKE YOU COME OUT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE WE SEE PROJECTS- AND OF COURSE WE'VE HAD A HISTORY OF- BOTH LOVE A AND- MAYBE DISSATISFACTION WITH SOME RULINGS OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHETHER IT'S AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE THAT'S BEEN REPORTED OR WHETHER IT'S A DEVELOPMENT- I HAVE CERTAINLY WORKED WITH THE COMMISSION AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER ON PROJECTS IN IN SAN DIEGO AS YOU HAVE- I'M NOT I REALLY THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY- TO WEIGH IN AND FRANKLY- THE LOCAL COASTAL PLANS ALREADY ADDRESS A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES THE REAL FOCUS OF THIS BILL. IS BRING IN OTHER ENTITIES ON BOARD TO WORK WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND NOT JUST THE E. P. A. AS I STATED IN MY THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EPA AGENCIES BUT TRANSPORTATION AND ON OTHERS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO BROADEN THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S IMPACT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS HEALTHY TO BE SKEPTICL OF HOW ANY AGENCY WORKS AND ALL OF US WHETHER WE SUPPORTED AGENCY OR NOT IN PHILOSOPHY OR PRINCIPLE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT'S STAND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION AS HAD THE HISTORIC DESIGNATION OF HAVING TO PROTECT THE COASTLINE WHICH HAS BEEN NO SMALL FEAT- SO I AM NOT BUT I BUT I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AND I THINK IT WILL BE UP AND COMING UP ON ALL OF US TO HAVE. THAT COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU. FATHER KIRK. MISTER WEISS. BERRYHILL FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD I STARTED WORKING WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND. NINE APPROXIMATELY ON THIS ISSUE- ON ON A PLANNING STRATEGY ON HOW TO COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE AND IT'S BEEN. I DON'T QUITE A TIME OF WORK SO I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. TO CARRY ON AND CARRY FORWARD WITH THAT WITH THE MEASURE SUCH AS THIS AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OFTEN IS NOT CONSIDERED. IN THIS IN THIS CONVERSATION IS HOW MUCH. OF WATER THAT NATURALLY AND USED YOU KNOW NATURALLY JUST OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN SEQUESTERED IN INOWROC OFFERS AND ARE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW ARE ARE. THE STATE'S RESERVES OF WATER KNOCK FIRST HAS BEEN GREATLY DEPLETED WHERE WOULD SOME AREAS WE'VE SEEN THIRTY FIVE FEET OF. FIRST AND THAT ALSO IS PART OF THE EQUATION OF- OF MAKING SURE THAT I MEAN NOT ONLY DOES THAT WATER SERVE THE PURPOSES OF AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN USE BUT IT ALSO HELPS TO COMBAT CIVIL SEALEVEL RISE SO WHEREVER WE CAN- YOU KNOW PUT SOME RESOURCES INTO RESTORING ESTABLISHING THAT ALSO. PART OF THE STRATEGY I THINK THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT THAT. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE I'VE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO RESTORING THE SALTON SEA AND WE'VE SEEN THAT- THAT LAKE GO BACK- IN. IT IN A SEA LEVEL IT ITS OWN LEVEL HAS BEEN GREATLY DEPLETED AND IF WE USE THAT ALSO AS A STORAGE WATER COULD HELP. THE ENVIRONMENT AND- IN FIFTY DIFFERENT WAYS TO REVENUE MANAGER HERE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. BUT THAT ALSO CAN HELP COMBAT SEA LEVEL RISE NETWORK WHERE WE LOOK AT ANY- LAKES. WITH NATURAL LAKES RESERVOIRS. AQUIFER'S ALL THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART THE STRATEGY- IN AND ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHERE WE HAVE HAVE THE DEAD SEA THE- OVERALL SEE ACROSS THE WORLD WE SEE. AN ENORMOUS- EMPTYING OF AQUIFER'S AND WATER BODIES THAT USED TO ONCE BE VIBRANT BODIES ARE NOW COMPLETELY DECIMATED BECAUSE OF HUMAN USE NOT HAS TO BE PART OF PART OF CALIFORNIANS ADVOCACY CROSS TO WORLD CHEN COURAGE THAT THANK YOU. OF MATTER PRO TERM FOR YOUR ENORMOUS WORK IN YOUR COUNTRY YOUR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE THIS IS A WONDERFUL BILL AND I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED. AS A CO AUTHOR IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. FURTHER OUR COMMENTS ARE QUESTIONS. IN I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS THIS IS THE ONE I HAVE BILLS OTHER THAN OF COURSE MY OWN. I FEEL PASSIONATE ABOUT IT IT IS HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE. IT IS FORTY YEARS AGO THIS NOVEMBER THAT I WAS FIRST ELECTED TO CITY OFFICE AND THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF A COASTAL TOWN WE HAD A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER FOR EROSION. AND WE HAD A ROUGH TIME AND THE STATE AT THE TIME REQUIRED. A MAJOR BEACH AREA IN OUR CITY AND IT WAS UP TO THE CITY TO PASS THE DESIGN AND WE DID SOMETHING THAT ALIENATED A KEY CONSTITUENCY GROUP IN SANTA CRUZ OF THE SURFERS BECAUSE WE WANTED THE ROAD TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET BACK. WE ENDED UP DOING IT AND THEN THE FORTY YEARS SINCE THEN NOW THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT EROSION. IN SOME OF THE PLACES EXACTLY. AS WE PREDICTED AND THEN WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE JUST TWO OF US IN ENTIRE SIX YEARS TO DO THE BILL IN ANY WAY ON SEA LEVEL RISE AND IT WAS DESIGNED. OF THE BILL THAT DIED IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME WAS DESIGNED TO ASK LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PLANNED FOR SEA LEVEL RISE AND HALF THE CONSTITUENCY GROUP SAID. WE WON'T SUPPORT IT UNLESS THERE'S A BASELINE IN THE BILL AND THE OTHER HALF SAID WHAT SUPPORT IF THERE IS A BASS LINE AND THE BILL. SO THAT IS WHAT KILLED THE BILL AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD. I END UP BEING RESOURCES SECRETARY IN CHARGE OF THE SCIENCE THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDED THE BASELINE FOR PLANNING. AND. THE SCIENCE WE APPROVED. ON THE DAY. THAT AND FOR THE- OCEAN PROTECT COUNCIL WHICH NINE TO BILL ON THE DAY THE SUIT. HIT FROM. JAPAN AND IT REALLY. DESTROYED TWO HARBORS IN CALIFORNIA ONE WAS IN MY DISTRICT AND THIS WAS WHEN THE TIDE WAS OUT BEFORE SEALEVEL RISE. AND AS I SAID AT THE TIME C. AUTHORIZES NOT LIKE A BATHTUB SLOWLY FILLING UP. IT IS ACTUALLY THE EXTREME OF THAT IT IS THE TWO YEAR OLD CANNON BALLING INTO THE BATH TUB AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT TSUNAMI AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR. AND WE DID GUIDANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BASED ON THE SCIENCE WE FUNDED UPDATES AND LOCAL COASTAL PLAN SO THAT PEOPLE COULD START TO PLAN FOR SEA LEVEL RISE. AND AS SENATOR EGGMAN SAID. THE BETWEEN A TEN YEAR FLOOD IN THE DELTA. AND A HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD IN THE DELTA IS ONE FOOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE SO THIS IS NOT JUST A COASTAL ISSUE. AND SO THE QUESTION IS AS THERE'S BEEN THIS PROGRESSION IN THE SCIENCE AND IN THE PLANNING WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THIS BILL. IT REALLY SETS IT UP IT SAYS THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO COLLABORATE UP AND DOWN THE COAST BECAUSE IT INVOLVES EVERY BRANCH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IT INVOLVES ALL THESE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AND THIS BILL SETS THE FRAMEWORK FOR MOVING AHEAD AND MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND SO. I'M GOING TO BE PROUD TO SUPPORT IT I HOPE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I COULD BE A CO AUTHOR. AND I ALSO NOTED FOR THE RECORD THAT- YOU HAVE AGREED TO ADD SENATOR STERN AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. YES AND IF YES MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COURSE AND ALSO I'M AWARE THAT US SENATOR HERTZBERG WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED SO BETWEEN THIS COMMITTEE AND APPROACH TO MAKE SURE ALL OF THE- RELEVANT MEMBERS WHO WANT TO BE ADDED WILL BE ADDED. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. ARE YOU WANT TO COMMENT SENATOR STERN OKAY GO AHEAD. MADAM SORRY COULDN'T BE FOR THE PRESENTATION OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION I'VE- DEFERRED TO ARE SENATE SOURCE OF WISDOM ON ALL THIS AND SHARE AT THIS AT THIS POINT THANK YOU FOR THE INSIGHT AND I WAS GOING TO FORMALLY HAS TO BE SIGNED ON BUT I JUST APPRECIATE THE MEASURE- AND WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING SB FORTY FIVE RIGHT ON THE HEELS OF THIS MEASURE I THINK THOSE ARE WELL PAIRED THOSE THOSE IT GROUP INITIATIVES THE PRICE TAG IS ENORMOUS. I SAY IT'S A T. NOT A B. THOSE ARE SCARY NUMBERS WHEN YOU LOOK AT ENTIRE TRAIN SYSTEM FALLING INTO THE WATER ALL THE REPAIRS IN YOUR AREA HOURS- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE AND THINKING BIG BECAUSE INCREMENTALISM WON'T DEAL WITH SOMETHING AS BIG AS THE TIDES- THANKS WELL YOU'LL BACK THANKS THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS- A TIME YOU. CLOSE THANK YOU- I WOULD. APPRECIATE SO MUCH THE COMMENTS AND CERTAINLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN- IN THE- THE SEA LEVEL RISE HAS RISEN ABOUT EIGHT TO NINE INCHES SINCE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. A THIRD OF THAT IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF DECADES THAT YOU MADE REFERENCE TO. AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST ADD I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE SUPPORT THAT I HEARD ON THE PHONE. TELECONFERENCE FROM A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS IN BUT I JUST ALSO WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS. IN MY OWN COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO THE IMPACT TO OUR MILITARY INSTALLATIONS WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT WE ARE- OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST MILITARY INSTALLATION- IN THE WORLD- IN CALIFORNIA AND IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OUR WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANT OUR CONVENTION CENTER THE AIRPORT THE RAIL LINE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED. AND MY COMMUNITY IS SIMILAR TO MANY COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF COASTLINE. SO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES. THAT WOULD BE- IN TERMS OF. OUR ECONOMIC IMPACT I WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT OUR ECONOMIC IMPACT. THE OCEANS ECONOMY INCLUDING TOURISM RECREATION AND MARINE TRANSPORTATION IS VALUED AT FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO OUR ECONOMY. SO THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO DO THIS AND TO BE PREPARED AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT ON THE PLATE TODAY. CERTAINLY WANT TO ADD ALL OF THE CO AUTHORS BETWEEN NOW IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED. I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND JUST BEFORE WE MOVE TO A VOTE WE'VE ALSO HAD A REQUEST FROM SENATOR LAMAR. TO BE ADDED AS CO AUTHOR. I SAW ESTAMOS. FACTORED PLEASED THE ROLL.

FOR FORTY FIVE WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO- UMBANDA WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FORTY FIVE- BUT I WANT TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO US SENATORS ALLEN AND STERN WHO LED THIS CHARGE LAST YEAR AND WHO ARE- JOINT AUTHORS WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER SENATORS SO THANK YOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE- FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER WITH MEXICO CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY EXPERIENCING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE JUST HEARD. THE PRO TEM DETAIL SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS FOR US WE NOW HAVE AN ETERNAL FIRE SEASON WE USED TO TALK ABOUT. FIRE SEASON BEING A CERTAIN CONFINED TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MONTHS AND COURSE NOW IT'S- TWELVE MONTHS LONG. WATER SHORTAGES AND INCREASED DROUGHT MORE SEVERE FLOODING AND OTHER DISASTROUS WEATHER EVENTS AND AN ESCALATING NUMBER OF EXTREME HEAT DAYS. THAT PUT OUR RESIDENTS AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AT RISK. THESE EVENTS ARE ALREADY COSTING CALIFORNIA BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR THAT'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR IMPACT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION NOW TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THESE EFFECTS TO ADAPT OUR CHANGE TO OUR CHANGING CLIMATE. DEVELOP CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND MITIGATE CLIMATE DISASTERS THAT WILL SURELY BE AHEAD OF US IF WE SIT ON OUR HANDS AND DO NOTHING. TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB FORTY FIVE THE WILDFIRE SAFE DRINKING WATER DROUGHT PREPARATION AND FLOOD PROTECTION BOND ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH WILL PUT A BALLOT MEASURE BEFORE CALIFORNIA VOTERS TO FIND THE SOLUTIONS WE DESPERATELY NEED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA FROM FURTHER RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WILDFIRES ARE A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT WHAT NOT LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE PROLONGED DROUGHT AND INCREASED TEMPERATURES. HAVE KILLED OFF MILLIONS OF TREES IN THE LAST DECADE ALONE LEAVING YOU SWATCH OF HIGHLY COMBUSTIBLE TENDER. RECORD SETTING FIRES IN TWENTY TWENTY. TOPPED RECORD SETTING FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH TOP RECORD SETTING FIRES JUST A FEW YEARS PRIOR. MORE THAN FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES BURNED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN THE LAST FOUR YEARS CALIFORNIA FIRES HAVE KILLED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE DESTROYED FORTY FOUR THOUSAND STRUCTURES. AND POLLUTED AIR FOR MILLIONS. WORSE STILL. THE WILDFIRE CLIMATE FEEDBACK LOOP IS DEVASTATING CLIMATE CHANGE TRIGGERS MORE MASSIVE AND MORE FREQUENT WILDFIRES ANY EXTRA FIRES DON'T MILLIONS MORE TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND WIPE OUT CARBON SEQUESTERED FARCE DWARFING THE PROGRESS CALIFORNIA'S MADE REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM VEHICLES AND THE ENERGY SECTOR. SEVERE DROUGHT COUPLED WITH SOME OF THE HOTTEST YEARS EVER RECORDED MEANS WITH PRECIPITATION DOES WHEN PRECIPITATION DOES FALL IT COMES DOWN AS RAIN AND RUSHES TO THE OCEANS INSTEAD OF LINGERING AT SNOW PACK IN OUR MAJESTIC SIERRA'S. THIS ISN'T JUST A PROBLEM FOR SKIERS HISTORICALLY MUCH OF STATES FRESH DRINKING MUCH OF THE STATE'S FRESH DRINKING WATER COMES FROM THE SLOW TRICKLE OF MELTING SNOW. OUR STATE PLANS ASSUME THIS BEAUTIFUL LIFE FORCE WILL MAKE ITS WAY BACK INTO OUR ACTUAL FILTERS FOR YEAR ROUND FRESH WATER THAT HOLDS US OVER INTO DRY YEARS. BUT IF THAT SNOW ISN'T THERE YEAR AFTER YEAR WE HAVE NO WAY TO ADEQUATELY WOULD CHARGE OUR GROUNDWATER BASINS. SEALEVEL RISE AGAIN WE JUST HEARD OF- ABOUT THAT SEA LEVEL RISE IN RESULT IN COASTAL FLOODING IS ALREADY RUNNING CALIFORNIA'S COASTLINE AND IS EXPECTED TO THREATEN NEARLY HALF A MILLION RESIDENTS. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY AND THIRTY FIVE. HUNDRED MILES OF ROADS WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS WITHOUT ADAPTIVE MEASURES IN PLACE. IN ADDITION. TO MORE DROUGHT AND INCREASING SEA LEVELS CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO BRINGS US. MORE CONCENTRATED RAINSTORMS FROM ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS INSTEAD OF STEADIER LIGHTER RAIN VASTLY INCREASING THE FLOOD RISK FOR CALIFORNIA'S GROWING RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS SOME FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BUILDINGS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FLOODING. AND 20% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION ALREADY LIVES IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS AND THESE FIGURES EXCLUDE ESSENTIAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ROADS AIRPORTS AND SEAPORTS. THE STATE IS INVESTING LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT IT IS NEEDED TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE GROWING FLOOD RISK FROM THESE MORE INTENSE WEATHER EVENTS THE COST TO REPAIR EXISTING LEVY IN DEFENSE OF FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE. IS EXPECTED TO BE THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS PROPER INVESTMENT IN FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE CAN PROTECT BUILDINGS AND AGRICULTURAL WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESERVING ECOSYSTEMS AND WILDLIFE HABITAT.

CALIFORNIA SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHILE AND DURING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOSSES DUE TO DISASTERS. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIMAGINABLE A DECADE AGO. SB FORTY FIVE REPRESENTS THE SMARTEST PLAN YET. FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS. THAT ARE INHERENT WITH THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENT A COHESIVE COLLABORATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH MODERN DISASTERS. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ONLY CONCENTRATE ON SUPPRESSION CHECK OUT THE MAKES NO SENSE TO GET A MARK FUNDING JUST FOR PREVENTION. WE WILL BE MONITORING FIVE TRILLION MUCH NEEDED TO TRY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION MUCH NEEDED DOLLARS TO ENHANCE CAL FIRE CAPACITY FOR FIRE PREVENTION. PEOPLE MANAGEMENT EMPIRE RESPONSE. CALIFORNIA WILL BE IN A BETTER PLACE FOR THE INEVITABLE BECAUSE OF THIS BOND. MONEY IS DESIGNED TO BE CAREFULLY SPENT ON UP ON THOSE PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES TO CATER. CAL FIRE LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO'S LEGISLATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT INVESTORS WILL BE PART OF THAT FUTURE. BONTA FINANCE PROJECT WILDLAND FIRE PREVENTION STATE DRINKING WATER CROWD PREPARATION AND FLOOD PROTECTION IS INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE WE TALK ABOUT PROTECTING THE NEXT GENERATION. AB FORTY FIVE ACCOMPLISHES THAT GOAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT- HE WAS TEED UP TO BE- A MAIN WITNESS AT THE BEGINNING SO FOR THE THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT JUST DID TO ME TOO YOU WERE NOT ROBBED.

AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THEIR LINE NUMBER IN PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FORTY FIVE PLEASE PRESS ONE. ZERO NOW. SO WHAT'S PROVED TO- WITH. THE MESSAGE HERE WE HAVE NO ONE TO ONE UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WE GOING TO BRING THE MATTER BACK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATE REGNANT. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CENTER PORTANTINO IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND- TAKING ON THIS BIG HUGE ISSUE- MY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WILL BE. ASSOCIATED AND AROUND THE AREA REPRESENT THE DELTA- SO IN IN PAST BONDS LANGUAGE HAS BEEN INCLUDED THAT STATES THAT NO BOND MONEY CAN BE USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION- OF THE CONVEYANCE PROJECT- AS THE WATER AGENCIES WHO WILL PROFIT FROM THAT SHOULD BE THE ONES PAYING FOR THAT- IN THE PAST WE'VE HAD THAT LANGUAGE IN EVERY CHAPTER I DON'T KNOW THAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS ONE BUT I'D CERTAINLY CURIOUS. IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING AND I WOULD HOPE SO TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE LIKE THAT THAT NO BOND FINANCING CAN BE USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONVENIENCE AND THEN SECONDLY I WONDERING ABOUT OUR LEVEES IN ORDER WE CAN WE CAN KEEP HIM OUT SEALEVEL RISE AND MAINTAINING BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A VAST LIBBY SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE MAINTAINED SO IF THERE WOULD BE- FUNDING AND THEREFORE OUR LEVEE SYSTEM AND BEING ABLE TO GET IT UP TO EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS WHICH MOST OF OUR LEVEES DO NOT MEET EXISTING FEDERAL STANDARDS RIGHT NOW. AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND THAT THEMSELVES SO OF COURSE AROUND. LANGUAGE THAT- AND THEN AND I'LL ALSO ADD THAT THE LEVEES ARE MORE THAN THE YELLOW BYPASS PROJECT. BUT DOWN INTO THE DELTA AND THEN BY FINAL QUESTION AROUND THAT IS AROUND- INVASIVE SPECIES- AND IF THEY'LL BE MONEY FOR THAT WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM. WITH THAT NUTRIA BURTON BURROWING INTO OUR LEVEES AND- AT. WEAKENING THEM. AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME WITH WITH A CLICK CLIMATE CHANGE WE AS AS YOU KNOW HAVE EXPERIENCE. REALLY HIGH HEAT- BIN THEN BECAUSE- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE DELTA. WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF- WATER HYACINTH BACKLOGS WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF ALGAE THAT REALLY TAKES BROUGH IN THE SUMMERTIME. MAKING IT THAT WATER TOXIC- FOR KIDS FOR ANIMALS FOR EVERYBODY WHO TOUCHES IT. SO MY THREE YEAR IT'S ALL AROUND THE DELTA. I HAD NO COULD NO MONEY FOR CONVENIENCE- DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THEN THE IDEA OF- INVASIVE. SPECIES BOTH FLORA AND FAUNA. GREAT- SO AS FAR AS THE ONE GOESI MET WITH THE FIVE COUNTY- DELEGATION THEY MENTION THE SAME CONCEPT I ASKED THEM TO SUPPLY THE LANGUAGE AND THEN I WOULD SEND IT TO THE COMMITTEE- TO MAKE. IT THE DELTA NEUTRAL- I DIDN'T SAY A THROUGH THE THROUGH THE COMMITTEE I'M WAITING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO GET BACK TO ME. IF IT IS SOMETHING STANDARD THAT'S AND EVERYBODY I DON'T SEE AN ISSUE WITH IT BUT I. JUST WANT TO SEE THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEEN AND PASS BONDS AND HAVE THE STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER TO DISCUSS IT SO. IN PRINCIPLE I'D SAY YES BUT IN PRACTICE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I GOT ALL MY EYES AND- DOT ACROSS ON MY TEASE BEFORE I SAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. ON THAT BUT YES IT'S GOING THROUGH THE RIGHT SYSTEM. ON THE LEVEES OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BOND IS REGIONAL AS IT AS POSSIBLE WE HAVE A CERTAIN FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE TO STAY WITH- SO. AGAIN WITHIN THE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE I CERTAINLY AM OPEN TO INCLUDING BRINGING UP THE LEVEES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW I LIVE IN WEST SAC AND I. WALK ON THE LEVEES OR RIDE MY BIKE ON THE LEVEES EVERY DAY AND SO- I SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE LEVY SO. AS LONG AS IT FITS INTO OUR FIVE FINANCIAL CONSTRUCT I DON'T SEE ANY ISSUE. MISTER ALAN DO YOU SEE ANY ISSUE WITH THAT. I THE LEVEES I'M IT'S MORE OF A FINANCE ISSUE THAN. BEEN A FOR. ISSUE SO WITH. RUN THAT THROUGH A- THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND ON THE INVASIVE SPECIES. AGAIN I. BEEN CONCEPT AGREED THAT WE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THAT AND IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE YOU WANT TO ADD. YEAH BRING IT TO US AND I'LL CERTAINLY BRING IT BACK TO THAT TODAY STAKEHOLDERS AND WOULD LOVE YOUR INPUT. FURTHER ON ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES UP IN TASTIC AT THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK AND UPGRADE IT AND THEN LIKE I SAY IT CONCEPT I SUPPORT ALL OF IT AND AS WE GET THE DETAILS WORKED OUT AND- THEN WE'LL SEE AS AS WE GO FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS. TURN AROUND I MEAN I HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND IT BUT I KNOW THERE IS SOME MONEY IN THE BEEN THERE FOR LEVEES ALL ALL ON. IT WHETHER IT'S UP TO THE FEDERAL STANDARD OR NOT THAT'S THE PIECE I DON'T KNOW. MONEY IN THERE BUT HOW MUCH. AND HOW MUCH WE CAN GET. THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION. WELL I. GET THE COMMENT. THE IF. ARMY CORPS OF. APPROVES OF PRO. IN ITS JUST QUESTION OF WHETHER. OF FUNDS ARE IN THIS MEASURE THAT ARE ALLOWED TO MATCH IT. AND SO. THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER IT MEETS THE STANDARD AND- I WOULD ALSO JUST. AS A NEUTRAL. ON THIS ONE JUST OFFERED THAT A LEVY BOND MEASURE WAS DONE PROP ONE EIGHTY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THE AMOUNT OF IT WAS BEFORE I RECALL ABOUT A THIRD OR HALF FOR SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY OF THIS TOTAL BOND SO I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD BE AN EXPECTATION THAT IF THERE'S ANY LEVY MONEY IN HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT TOWARD WHAT THE NEED THIS. SENATOR ON I WANT THANKS CALIFORNIA I MOVED FROM OF THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION IS THERE ARE THERE FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIS SING NINE THAN SENATOR PORTANTINO YOU CAN CLOSE THIS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTED I GOT A TEXT WHAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT THE LANGUAGE THERE'S BEEN AND EVERY BOND FOR TWENTY YEARS SO I'M NOT ANTICIPATING AN ISSUE WITH IT I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINAL LANGUAGE SELF RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. BRITAIN WANTS US THE SECRETARY TO CALL THE ROLL. OKAY SB FORTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE FIRST BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE LAYERED BY LETTER TO. JONES JONES NO ALLEN. ALLEN ALL RIGHT EGGMAN. EGGMAN HI GROVE. GROVE NO HERTZBERG HUESO. LOAN HI THE MOON I STERN. WE WILL HOLD THAT ARE OPEN UNTIL WE CAN AT THE ABSENT MEMBERS. THANK YOU. APAR IS MR STERN GOING TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR AND PRESENT HIS BILL. YOU'RE POINTING AT SOMETHING. PROFORM RIGHT. WITHIN THE NEXT NON COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT THIS PRESIDENT. UNLESS THIS IS SENATOR STERN. NO THAT'S DEFINITELY NOT SENATOR STRUCK. BUT THAT IS SOMEBODY THAT'S IN FRONT OF SENATOR CALVET EURO IN LINE AND- SO- THEN WE WILL MOVE- TO HIRE FILE ITEM SIX SB EIGHTY FOUR SENATOR PER TANTO OIL AND GAS WELLS CENTER ROTANA WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. AT GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO START A BY A STEP IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REFLECT ON PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE NOW SIS. AND TO THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL. COLLEAGUES IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR THE KERN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD A HEARING. ON THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY REGULATIONS. SUPERVISOR SCRIVNER SAID SOMETHING DURING THIS HEARING THAT LED ME TO DRAFTING THIS BILL HE SAID. CALDERON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OLDER WELLS AND I WANT TO SEE MORE MONEY SENT TO US FROM ORPHANED WELLS AND ABANDONMENT PROGRAM. I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON COASTAL COUNTIES ON THAT PROGRAM AND YET AGAIN. BUT THE MONEY COMES FROM THE KERN COUNTY BUSINESSES. SO WE NEED MORE OF THAT TO BE HERE. SB EIGHTY FOUR IS NOT ABOUT OIL OR AND OR ENVIRONMENTALISTS THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUITY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LONG BEEN LEFT BEHIND. IT IS ABOUT REAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THIS IS A REPUBLICAN ISSUE ANY DEMOCRATS ISSUE BECAUSE IMPROVED AIR QUALITY IS GOOD FOR EVERYONE'S HEALTH. THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE NATION'S MOST POLLUTED REGION AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO REMEDIATION FUNDS AS THEY DO IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT SAID SB EIGHTY FOUR REQUIRES ENHANCED REPORTING RELATIVE TO HAZARDOUS LONG TERM IDOL AN ORPHAN WELLS. TODAY THERE ARE POSSIBLY A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND ACTIVE OR IDLE OIL AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF CURVES AND THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY. IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THIS REGION A NUMBER OF LONG TERM IDLE AND ABANDONED OIL WELLS THAT ARE NOT PROPERLY DID COME DECOMMISSIONED CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THE STATE HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS AND PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE REMEDIATION OF LONG TERM IDOL AN ORPHAN WELLS ALONG THE COAST AND DOES REQUIRE OPERATORS TO PAY FEAR SUBMIT A PLAN TO ADDRESS THEIR IDOLS. THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ON WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THESE WELLS ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE. SB EIGHTY FOUR PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY AROUND ORPHAN WELL REMEDIATION AND GIVES US A BETTER PICTURE OF WHAT EQUITY AND WATER REMEDIATION CAN AND SHOULD LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OR WE HAVE NO LISTED- LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SO WE WILL GO TO. BORROW WITNESSES. FOR A NAY MAN OR- IN SUPPORT IS THERE ANYBODY IN THIS COMMITTEE WORLD THAT WISHES TO OFFER SUPPORT. THIRTY ONE IN ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SAYING NO ONE AT THE PODIUM THEIR MODERATOR OF THIS WOULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR NAME AN ORGANIZATION FROM ANYONE IN SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB. EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE. ZERO NOW. ONE MOMENT THE CHAIR.

MY ABILITY TO STATE PROJECT THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED WAS ESTIMATED TO BE. FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THE ESTIMATE TO MEDIATE ALL SEVENTY THOUSAND IDLE AND ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL WELL. GOOD COPIES MUCH AT FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO REMEDIATE IN CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO SEE MORE DESERTED AND IDYLLWILD FUTURE OF THE STATE OIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO DECLINE AND MORE COMPANIES ABOUT A BUSINESS. ATTENTION TO FURTHER WELL DUE TO THE COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS WILL CALL THE STATE TAXPAYERS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM ONLY FILL OUT THE BILL DON'T FALL SHORT OF DOING THAT. ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO KNOW IS THAT OUR MEMBERS WERE EXTREMELY UNHAPPY LAST YEAR WE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION CONTENDER. AND TWELVE BUT THE BILL WOULD LATER BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE VERY LANGUAGE THAT THE CONCERNED ABOUT. THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT THAT ISSUED TODAY- AND THEN WE HAD TO RESTART OUR OPPOSITION WE DON'T WANT A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT SENATOR WILL REMAIN COMMITTED TO HER DECISION TO ACCEPT THE CALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE WE JOURNAL ARE. THREE MINUTES TOTAL. THE WITH THE- AND I THE FOR ONE FOR LEAD OPPOSITION USED ALL THAT TIME. BUT LET ME GIVE THE- FOR BRIAN WICKED CENTER FOR BY ONE.

WILL BE PLEASED TO REVIEW THIS BILL AND REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WITH THE PROPOSED CHANGES THANK YOU TO SENATOR CADDO AND TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING ON THOSE. THE ONLY THING TO ADD TO ITFINE ALREADY SAID IS THAT AT THIS POINT WE SEE CAL JIM GETTING THROUGH ONLY THIRTY CAN WELL SPREE YEAR OF CLOSING. IDLE WELLS AND- ANDREW. THEM SO GIVEN MANY WELLS WE CURRENTLY HAVE IDLE WELLS IN THE STATE THAT CAN TAKE US. OVER A THOUSAND YEARS TO GET THROUGH ALL THE WELLS IN CALIFORNIA BUT NEED CLOSURE. AND REMEDIATION. WE VERY MUCH WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO ADDRESS WHAT KEPT AT TAHOE CAL JOHN. XCELERATED THOSE EFFORTS AND- AND TO SEE HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY FIX THAT PROBLEM.

A PROVISION ABOUT THE SUPERVISORS PEOPLE- AND WE'RE AND WE'VE- BACK THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD THE PROVISION IN WHICH ARE EQUIPMENT POSITION THE FACT THANK YOU MUCH YEAH. THANK OTHER SPEAKER NOT THIS. ONE OF MY THIRTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO. I WANT MEET AMONG WITH AUDIBLE CAL. WE WILL BE REMOVING OPPOSITE ONE THE AMENDMENTS CALL IN TO COURT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR DISSECTING TO AND QUEUE. YES IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE AND NOW IT'S BACK IN OF THE FOR OR COMMENTS. YES SIR GROVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND TO THE AUTHOR MISTER SADDAM I SUPPORTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND LET THE SENATE FLOOR AND THEN YOU- TOOK SOME AMENDMENTS. ON THE ASSEMBLY SITE THAT- WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY SUPPORT BECAUSE- THE BILL LAST YEAR THE WAY IT WAS WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH I'D WELLS WHICH WE NEED TO ADDRESS. ESPECIALLY IN KERN COUNTY WE OF THIS WE PRODUCE 75% OF THE STATE'S OIL IN. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES IN KERN COUNTY WHICH YOU'RE A PART OF- THE REPRESENTATION IN IT THE ITEM WILL ISSUE DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT YOUR BILL JUST EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM. A ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THE MAJOR PROBLEM WE HAVE IS WE NEED PERMITS AND TO BE ISSUED FROM CAL JAM TO BE ABLE TO- ADDRESS SEASIDE WELLS AND A FAIR PRICE NEEDS TO BE PAID. I KNOW THAT- A LOT OF OPERATORS THAT GO INTO- FIX SEASIDE WELLS AND APPROPRIATE- PROPERLY DISPOSE OF THEM OR TO SEAL THE UP. AND TO GET A PERMIT OR A CHANGE PERMIT FROM CAL JIM IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND IT TAKES TIME. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A QUICK MEANT AND EVERYTHING ON THE JOB AND WHEN YOU GET INTO THE GROUND AND YOU FIND A PIECE OF METAL AND METAL WASN'T PART OF THE PERMIT TO REMOVE YOU HAVE TO CALL CAL JAM. GET AUTHORIZATION THAT TAKES WEEKS PEOPLE ARE STUCK ON THE JOB THEY'RE PAYING PEOPLE TO NOT DO A JOB SO THE PROBLEM IS CAL JIM. AS FAR AS THE PERMIT PROCESS GOES IN ORDER TO HELP- WELLS BE CLOSED OUT- I DID WAS TO BE CLOSED OUT PROPERLY. THE OTHER PART THAT WE HAVE AS A- IN QUE JIM. THAT AND- YOU KNOW THERE ARE OPERATORS OUT THERE THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE ON CERTAIN LEASES LIKE I'VE AN OPERATOR NOW IN KERN COUNTY THAT'S WAITED. ALMOST TWO YEARS. TO TAKE ON A LEASE THAT WAS ABANDONED BY A PRIOR OPERATOR AND TO OPERATE THAT LEASE- WELL AND WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL. OF POLICIES THAT- THE- CALIFORNIA. REQUIRES A IN THIS OPERATOR IS GOING TO EXTENT TO. OBTAIN PERMITS FROM CAL JAM WHICH TWO YEARS IS STILL NOT PROVIDED TO THIS OPERATOR- I'M ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS NOW BECAUSE NOW THE- THE LAWFUL LEGAL OPERATOR THAT WOULD DO A GREAT JOB OPERATING THESE WELLS WERE ABANDONED. IS THROWING HIS HANDS UP AND GONE LOOK I GET WITH THIS FOR TWO YEARS I'M DONE- SO IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING SO THE SOLUTION IS TO FIX WHAT'S GOING ON AT CAL JAM. AND NOT TO PUT FORTH A BILL- AND I'M JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOU NOT TO PUT FORTH A BILL THAT- IN THE BEGINNING. DID DO SOMETHING TO HELP IT REALLY DID THE BILL YOU FOR SUBMITTED IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THE SENATE SIDE THAT WE VOTED FOR AND SUPPORTED. LAST YEAR DID DO SOMETHING TO HELP AT LEAST IT MOVE THE BALL A LITTLE BIT FORWARD TO WHERE RESOURCES WILL GO BACK TO KERN COUNTY. AND OPERATORS COULD BE PAID EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T GET THE PART THE PERMITS. FROM CAL JIM OR THEY WERE DELAYED IN THE PROCESS. IT'S JUST A BACKLOG IN CALCIUM. AND SO. AND THEN YOU TOOK AMENDMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE UNDER PRESSURE I'M SURE WHICH REMOVED- INDUSTRY OPPOSITION AND I VOTED NO WHEN IT CAME BACK TO THE SENATE FLOOR. I DIDN'T COME BACK TO SIMPLER BUT I WOULD HAVE VOTED NO. AND BECAUSE IT DID IT JUST FURTHER EXACERBATED THE PROCESS. AND SO ON. I HAVE TO DEPRIVE TO NOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT JUST FURTHER EXACERBATES A PROCESS. IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FIX THE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE. AND IF THE GOAL WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD GOAL IS TO SHUT DOWN THESE IDLE WELLS OR HAVE GOOD OPERATORS TAKE OVER THESE IDLE WELLS. AND PRODUCE THE ENERGY SAFELY NUMBER EMILY FRIENDLY. IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF IN VENEZUELA OR OTHER FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE DISMAL HUMAN RIGHTS. AND POLICIES AND HORRIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. AND KEEP JOBS HERE KEEP DOMESTIC ENERGY HERE. AS IF THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND CAL JIM WITH THE PERMIT PROCESS AND- ON IDOL WELL PROCESSES WELL. BECAUSE THERE ARE GOOD OPERATORS OUT THERE THAT WANT TO TAKE OVER IDLE WELLS. AND FIX THINGS- BUT THE BACKLOG IS IN IN CAL JIM. AND- SO. I'M SORRY BUT IT REPRESENTING KERN COUNTY AND- RESHARE. BILL YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO BRING MONEY BACK TO THE DISTRICT BUT- YOU CAN BRING ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD BACK TO THE DISTRICT BUT THEY CAN'T GET A PERMIT TO CLOSE DOWN AYE WELL IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. THE CIVIC CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRESS AND YOU'RE CLOSE. DISH YES ABSOLUTELY OKAY CENTER OUR PART I'M IN A DIFFERENT I'M JUST. WELL UNLESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING SOMETHING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN- I AGREE THAT IS- IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT BACK COLLEGE AND HAVING TO TAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO FIND THEIR LEVEL PARTY. AND DID IT WOULD HAVE EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW BUT BUT NOW NOW- BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO LITIGATING KEEP RIGHT ON THE PAN AM WELLS OPEN LONGER AND- BUT NOW NOW THE BILL JUST REQUIRES REPORTING ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS IS GOING SO I. IT WHICH OF COURSE IT HELPS TO. KEEP THINGS MOVING SO I GUESS I'M- I'M NOT SEEING HOW THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTER AT A GIVEN THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE BILL TODAY. ASKING ME THAT QUESTION. FARMS BOB. BASHARA FUTURE OKAY SO I'M IN A I'M HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH INDUSTRY AND TO COMMUNICATING WITH INDUSTRY THEY SEE IT ON THE GROUND I MEAN I DON'T OPERATE WELL YOU DON'T OPERATE WELL BUT INDUSTRY SEES THIS IS AN EXACERBATIONS OF THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM TO ADDRESS SEASIDE WELLS AND SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S PROBLEM ABOUT THE IDOLS ARE HERE IS TO GET PERMITS OUT OF- TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN AND SHUT THESE WELLS DOWN. AND IT'S A VERY UNIQUE SKILL THERE AREN'T VERY MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE HAT DO THIS TO PROVIDE RESOURCES THAT SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO DOCTOR TO SHUT THESE WELLS DOWN WHICH WOULD ALLOCATED IN THE PAST AND ALSO A LITTLE DARKER DARKER PROVIDE PERMITS SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE AND I WORKED WITH CAL JIM NOT DOCTOR SKIS ME CAL JIM. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WHERE OPERATORS HAVE COME INTO SHUT DOWN THESE WELLS AND DO IT BUT WHEN THEY GET INTO THE GROUND THEY FIND THESE WELLS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE GROUND FOR A HUNDRED YEARS THAT HAVE METAL AND JUST ALL THE STUFF THAT THEY USED TO PLUG THE WELLS BEFORE WE HAD ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT DID DID AN REGULATED THIS IN SO. THEY CAN'T GET THE- PROCESS THROUGH. CAL JAM IN ORDER TO GET THE PERMIT TO ADJUST TO. TO REMOVE THE METAL TO- YOU KNOW TO ADJUST FOR THE WHAT THEY FIND IN THE GROUND. AND SO ON I'M RELYING ON INDUSTRY H<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; TRUST&lt;/c&gt;</u> IN THERE THAT SAYS IT'S GOING TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. WHAT ABOUT THIS EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM. WHAT A PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM. SO THAT THE PREVIOUS BILL IS WHAT IS SHE WAS WHEN SHE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. AND WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE PROCESS OF THIS BILL IN THE PROCESS DOESN'T. BUT WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE THIS WILL TAKE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. WHEN SHE GIVES A WORD THAT SHE'S NOT WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT WHAT I'M TELLING YOU IS IT OKAY EXACERBATIONS FOR YOUR WARNING HER ABOUT. SO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OF THE BILL NOW BUT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT TURN INTO LATER. YES WORD THE SAME ISSUE THAT WE FACE THE OPPOSITION BASED. IS IT SHE TOOK AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR TOOK AMENDMENTS. AFTER WE VOTED ON THE BILL- AND THEN SHE RETOOK AMENDMENTS BACK ON THE SET TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE BILL WHICH WE HAD WHICH- EGGS. YOU KNOW FRUSTRATED THE OPPOSITION- WHICH WAS CLEARLY STATED IN THE TESTIMONY. AND SO THIS BILL AS IS. EVEN WITH THE REPORTING PROCESS DOES NOT. FIX THE PROBLEM. THE IT DOES FIX THE BILL THE- WHAT WE NEED TO SORT OF MAKE POINTS AND BE ABLE TO MOVE ON THE SO. IS THERE ANY FURTHER ON THIS THE GOAL IS TO CLOSE DOWN IDLE WELLS IN THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT AND IT DOESN'T HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN OKAY. I FACE OKAY THAT I THAT I MISSED DROWNED IF YOU JUST HAVE A COMMENT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE THAT'S NOT A QUESTION OF SOMETIMES I JUST RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE FIVE EXACTLY DISAGREE. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTION OR COMMENTS MR TRUMP THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I. ENJOYED THE SPECTATOR. POSITION OF THE DEBATE OVER THERE SO YOU ARE ONLY SPEAKING FOR YOURSELF THAT YEAH I'M- YES I AM ONLY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF ACTUALLY HOW WE DO IT HERE YEAH- ACTUALLY THAT'S THE ONLY THAT'S NOT UNHEALTHY THING TO HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION OUT LOUD SO THAT. THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ACTUALLY DO- DEBATE THESE THINGS AND GET INTO A WOMAN AND REALLY PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS AND STUFF SO. ACERTAR I WAS. PREPARED TO VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY BUT- BASED ON THE- CONVERSATION OF AMENDMENTS COMING AND- YOU KNOW NOT I DON'T HAVE AN ANALYSIS ON THOSE POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS- MY RECOMMENDATION TO THE CHAIRS THAT WE HOLD THE BILL IN COMMITTEE- LET THOSE AMENDMENTS GET. PUT INTO THE BILL AND LET'S BRING IT BACK IN A WEEK OR TWO- OTHER THAN THAT- I'M GONNA HAVE TO LAY OFF TODAY SO. K. FOR THE COMMENTS. JUST BEFORE WE CLOSE LET. R. FOUR I APOLOGIZE SENATOR LEE MON. TWENTY RECOGNIZE YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT IS TAKING PLACE I DO SOME WORK AROUND THIS PIECE AND I THINK I WANT. THAT RECOGNIZE THAT AT. THE CENTER FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY MENTIONED THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST ON THE COAST ALTHOUGH I REPRESENT THE COAST AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THE BAND DIDN'T WORK AND WELLS I'M IN THE DISTRICTI REPRESENT TO AYE ABSOLUTELY IT IS NOT LIMITED OR RESTRICTED TO A PROBLEM ON THE COAST SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. I WAS PREPARED TO ALSO LAY OFF FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BUT WITH THE AUTHORS THAT SHE WILL BE. AMENDMENT I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT I THINK WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT AMENDMENTS LIKE. BUT I THINK. EVEN THOUGH I MYSELF SOMETIMES AT IN OPPOSITE PERSPECTIVE AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BUY TALK TO EIGHT DO YOU WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT I THINK I'VE HEARD BOTH SIDES OF THIS PERSPECTIVE I'M SURE THERE ONE THAT THE IMPACT OF IDLE AND ABANDONED AND ORPHANED WELLS I HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND TO THAT WE AGREE THAT THERE IS- A BACKLOG. ADD TO ASK HOW CHEN AND SO I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE TWO POINTS I THINK WE OFTEN FIND OURSELVES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE- AND THE PERSPECTIVE I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS A PARTISAN ISSUE I THINK IT'S A PERSPECTIVE- IT'S A LIVED EXPERIENCE FOR ME- OF THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT AS I KNOW IT IS FOR COLLEAGUES I'M IN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT I AM GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALSO REMEMBER. THE TWO THINGS WE FOUND IN COMMON TODAY- THAT THERE IS AN IMPACT TO HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT OF THE BAND IN AN ORPHAN WELLS THAT ARE NOT READY TO PROPERLY- AND ALSO THAT WE WANT TO DO MORE TO ALLOW CALTRAIN. TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AND NOT SEE THE BACKLOG THAT WE HAVE SEEN. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAN BE WE WILL GO TO A CLUB OUR TO MAKE A COMMENT AND THAT IS IT. WHEN CENTER GROVE SLIPPED AND USED TO WORK DOGGART IT WAS DELAYED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS FOR ME. BECAUSE I SUPERVISED ORDER FOR EIGHT YEARS. AND THE- THE ISSUE THAT SENATOR LA MON JUST OUTLINED SWELL IS PROFOUND IF- WE HAD ABANDONED AND ORPHANED WELLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE MONUMENTAL COST TO THE TAXPAYERS. IN ADDITION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT THAT COMES FROM THEM AND SO I SALUTE SENATOR HER TADO FOR TAKING THIS ON AND I THINK. THE AMENDMENTS MAKE THIS BILL BETTER WE WILL ALL BE LOOKING AT IT AS IT MOVES ALONG TO MAKE SURE THAT ADDRESSES THOSE ISSUES. AND TO SENATOR GROVE LET ME JUST TELL YOU. ONE OF THE MOST AMUSING MOMENTS FOR ME DURING MY TIME IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. WAS WHEN THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN MCCARTY STOOD UP. AND AUTHORED A BILL TO RAISE FEES IN THIS AREA. AND IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS SLOWER REGULATION THE INDUSTRY PAID THE FEES WHEN THEY PAID THE FEES IT WOULD MOVE THE PROCESS ALONG. BUT I ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD YIELD FOR A QUESTION AND ASK THEM IF THIS WAS THE FIRST OF MANY FEE BILLS THAT HE WAS GOING TO PUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE ASSEMBLY CAN. HE BLUSHED IT DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER BUT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THIS PRECISE ISSUE THAT HE HAD TO MOVE ALONG TO FEES TO MOVE ALONG TO REGULATION TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. THAT IT HAPPENED AND I THINK IT HAS TO BE NOTED THAT IT IS THE INDUSTRY. THAT PAYS FOR THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND IF THEY DON'T PAY ENOUGH THEY DON'T GET THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO BE ALLOWED TO DO IT AND SO ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE WRAPPED UP IN THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHY. I SAID THE CENTER FOR BE WILLING TO TAKE IT ON. OUR OWN IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS BILL OUR MOTION BY AIKMAN. OF THAN WHAT. OF THE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM S. B. EIGHTY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD TREE FIND ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANTS WHO WORKED WITH MY STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS ON RECENT AMENDMENTS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND ACCEPT. THE ONE CLEAN UP AMENDMENT AS WELL. SB FORTY SEVEN CREATIVE. CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE INCOME TAX TO HELP PROVIDE A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING TO CAL FIRE'S URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON SMALL URBANIZED COMMUNITIES THAT LACK. GOVERNMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FOR THE LONG TERM CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SHADE TREES THIS BECAME A- A REAL ISSUE FOR ME IS HOW WAS CAMPAIGNING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IN THE SUMMER AND IT GETS TO A HUNDRED AND TEN DEGREES- I HAVE. TWENTY SEVEN CITIES IN MY DISTRICT BUT TWENTY FOUR OF THEM THAT ARE SMALL. URBANIZED AREAS BUT- ARE POOR FARMWORKERS COMMUNITIES AND BOTTOM LINE IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. TO BE ABLE TO REQUIRE. THE PLANTING OF TREES AS PART OF THEIR URBAN FORESTRY- NEEDS AND YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE THE HEAT ISLANDS ARE JUST INCREDIBLY INTENSE. URBAN TREES COVER CANNOT COVER CANOPIES VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU HAVE A GREAT- LIST OF THE KINDS OF. OF COVERAGE YOU GET IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE STATE AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THE DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COUNTY AN INCORPORATED THERE IS HAVE LESS CANOPY. CANOPY COVER THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE COST OF TREE CARE IN THE INABILITY TO MANAGE TREES AT CIVIC INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE COMMUNITY STRUGGLE TO FIND AND MAINTAIN THEIR URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAMS LEADING TO THE INEQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND SUFFER FROM GREATER URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS AND WORST AIR POLLUTION. CALIFORNIA'S URBAN FORESTS FACE MULTIPLE CHALLENGES SUCH AS INVASIVE PEST CONTROL BUT THE ISSUE THAT SB THREE FORTY SEVEN ADDRESSES IS THE SIMPLE FACT. THE TREE PLANTING PROGRAMS COME AT A COST. IN THE COMMUNITIES IN GREATEST NEED OF TREES HAVE SCARCE RESOURCES TO INVEST IN TREES AS INFRASTRUCTURE. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AND CALIFORNIA FOREST PROGRAM WORKS WITH NINE GOVERNMENTAL ORGAN. AND THEY'RE REALLY THAT THE- THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WANT TO HELP SALAS TO HELP TO SOLVE THIS ON THE TAX FORM- LIKE OUR SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA URBAN FORESTRY COUNCIL AND CALIFORNIA RELIEF. I'M THEY HELP TO DELIVER PROGRAM FUNDS TO COMMUNITIES NEED TREES. SB THIRTY THREE FORTY SEVEN SIX VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS CORPORATIONS AND FOUNDATIONS INSTEAD OF GENERAL FUNDS BONDS ARE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND SOURCES. AND THE END NGOS THAT WORK WITH. WORK CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE TODAY GAINED A GREAT TOOL TO BE ABLE TO MARKET. BOB THIS PARTICULAR FUND TO THEIR THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN GETS CALIFORNIA HOME OF THE ORIGINAL TREE HUGGER A CHANCE TO GIVE DIRECTLY TO THE COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD TREE FIND IN ORDER TO GENERATE DEPENDABLE.

ONCE AGAIN THAT'S ONE THEN THEY WROTE. BEGIN OPPOSITION ABOUT. FIFTY THREE FORTY SEVEN. THOMAS THE HERE NO ONE IS SHOWING UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A SENATOR JONES. THANK YOU TOM CENTER I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE INCOME TAX RETURN FORM- IN THERE ISN'T ALREADY NINETEEN OTHER. CHECK OFFS ON THAT FORM ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT- THIS IS GOING TO GET LOST IN THAT. MORASS OF ALREADY CHECK OFFS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR- THAT THE WAY THAT THE CHECK OFF SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT IF YOU DON'T RATE IF YOU DON'T RAISE ENOUGH MONEY- AND I BELIEVE THAT CUT OFFICE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS YOU LOSE YOUR PLACE IN LINE AND SO- BY I WOULD BE WORRIED IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE BACKING OF A NUMBER OF TREE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WILLING TO GO OUT AND URGE THEIR MEMBERSHIPS TO MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS. OKAY AND THEN JUST A FOLLOW UP OF AYE MATE GERMAN OPERATE A REGARDING THE FUNDING YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE RAISES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND I'M- OUR ANALYSIS IS SHOWING MAYBE UP TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. URBAN FORESTRY IS ALREADY RECEIVING A LOT OF MONEY FROM. PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT. FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- FROM- IN. NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN- IN THE PRIOR- BOND BILL THAT TIME MR PORTANTINO IS PROPOSING- THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT- FOR URBAN FORESTRY. AND SO- MAYBE YOU WANT TO TALK TO YOU KNOW HOW DOES HOW DOES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY GRAND OR FIVE HUNDRED GRAND MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING. MULTIPLE I TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. WELL THE THIS IS PRODUCE SPECIFIC IT SPECIFICALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IS THE IS THE INTEREST IN THE FOCUS. THE G. R. G. MONEY IS A BASS LEADS- PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT IS GETTING THE END. TO THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SO NEW BOND MONEY IS GREAT BUT IT'S- USUALLY ONE TIME FUNDS AND ONCE IT'S USED THE- THERE'S NO OTHER- FUNDING SOURCE I LOOK AT THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE CONTINUAL FUNDING. AND IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DEPENDED ON TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE- IT'S NOT JUST PLANTING THE TREE IT'S GIVING THEM MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN. CONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TREE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME- AND SO HAVING A AND AB. SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT IS CONTINUING IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IS THE ORGANIZED ORGANIZATION TREE CITY USA ONE OF YOUR SUPPORTERS. I DON'T IT'S ON OUR ANALYSIS SO AND SOMETIMES THE REPUBLICANS GET. WE DON'T GET ALL OF THE LETTERS IN SUPPORT BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PORTAL DOESN'T ALWAYS- DISTRIBUTE THEM CHRIS I JUST WANTED MY ABOUT MY HOME TOWN JUST A TREE CITY USA SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY IS ONE. WOULDBE GREAT IF THEY IF THEY WOULD I MIGHT WE'RE GETTING LETTERS KIND OF AS WE SPEAK SO IS MINE BUT THAT'S A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. MIGHT NOT BE GETTING INVOLVED IN CALIFORNIA BILLS. WELL THEY OUGHT TO. I AGREE- NOTE THIS MOMENT I WAS GONNA LAY OFF I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL THIS MORNING I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA DO A GOOD JOB ON IT AND I THINK FOR. FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. LET ME JUST MAKE ONE BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE THAT AND THAT IS THAT FIGHT MINISTER THIS BOND PART. IN IT IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED IT WAS ALWAYS OVER SUBSCRIBED. AND THERE ARE ALWAYS MANY MANY CITIES IN LINE THE MINUTE THE MONEY RAN OUT. AND SO TO HAVE A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE. TO THE DEMAND IS THERE THIS WILL MEET IT THEN I THINK OF HER RATE IF IT'S IN A BOUGHT. OPERATE IF WE STILL HAVE BOND MONEY BUT WE WILL RUN OUT AND THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE THERE AND BE STUDY. AND THERE IS JUST TO DEMAND ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO I SALUTE YOU FOR DOING THIS- DID WE HAVE A MOTION. EFFORT CENTER EGGMAN BEAT YOU TO IT THIS TIME BUT OPERAS SO THAT'S A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE ALL I'M A DOCTOR STATEMENT AS MY CLOSING AND JUST SAY THAT- PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF THESE REALLY SMALL COMMUNITIES IS THEIR LAST IN LINE THEY THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO UP A GRANT APPLICATION IT'S A- COMPETITIVE AND SO I'M HOPING THAT SOME OF THIS WILL TRICKLE INTO THE COFFERS OF THOSE. THOSECITIES THAT REALLY NEED IT RIGHT THANK YOU ARE WITH THE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM TEN S. B. THREE FORTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. LAYARD BY LAYERED I'D JONES. JONES HI ALLEN. ALLEN AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN HI GROVE. GROOVE HI HERTZBERG WAY SO LONG. THE MONITORING HI I GUESS I DON'T HEAR THE SOUND LIMÃ³N AND STERN AYE STERN HI THAT HAVE OKAY THAT IS ENOUGH VOTES BEHOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE END OF THE HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU SENATOR WE APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE. A B. C. THREE. US SENATOR STERN WELCOME TO YOUR OWN COMMITTEE. AND IF JOHN JUST WAS TO BECAUSE HIM ABOUT THAT BILL HE'LL TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT LATER. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR THIS IS THE- GIVE THE GAS TO SOME KNOWS MUCH MORE- THAT ANYONE THE BUILDING. IF I RESOURCES I APPRECIATE I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS WHOLE HEARING IN MY- OFFICE IN THE DEBATE. IS ACTUALLY BEN EXCELLENT I KNOW IT'S BEEN LONG BUT REALLY THOROUGH AND SUB- THANK YOU FOR IT. SB SIXTY THREE. IS AN INTERESTING. ERIDGE OF IDEAS- WHERE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT IN HOW WE DISTRIBUTE FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING IN A WAY THAT- ADVANCES BOTH BUILDING SAFETY- BUT ALSO PRESERVES- ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY IN SOME OF OUR MOST ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE FIRE ZONES SO. TODAY I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP WE'VE DEVELOPED WHERE THE BUILDING INDUSTRY HAS REALLY COME TO THE TABLE AND STEPPED UP AND SAID YOU KNOW WE CAN BUILD FIRE SAFE NOT JUST IN THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES BUT AN OPENNESS TO EXTENDING THAT KIND OF BUILDING STANDARD THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION IN HIGH OR MODERATE- FIRE ZONES BECAUSE AS WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THESE FIRES. IF YOU LOOK AT- TUBS IN COFFEE PARKER I EVEN- DOWN THROUGH SANTA CRUZ OR BY THE FIRES HAPPENED IN OUR BACKYARD THEY'RE NOT JUST BURNING IN THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOUNDS SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THE NEW HOUSING THAT WE ALL NEED TO BECAUSE INTO THESE OTHER COMMUNITIES IS- AS RESILIENT AS POSSIBLE THAT IT ADOPTS EMBER RESISTANT- PRINCIPLES AND WE KNOW IT A LOT OF THESE FIRES COME DOWN TO THAT ONE AMBER ZIPPING THROUGH THAT EVENT. WORK OR- IT ONLINE GASKET IN YOUR GARAGE OUR RIGHT TO YOUR FURNACE IN THAT TAKES IT ALL DOWN IT COULD BE THAT THAT ONE LITTLE DIFFERENCE THAT THAT PIECE OF MASTERING EVE IT- IS AN OPENER GUTTER THAT HASN'T BEEN CLEANED. OR FOR THOSE SORT OF STANDARD ELEMENTS OF HOUSING THAT WE THINK CAN MAKE EVERYONE SAFE SO- THAT'S PART OF THIS BILL BUT THE OTHER PART OF IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY IS HAS STEPPED UP AND ENJOYING THIS IN PART AS PARTNERS HERE IN IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING ALSO FOCUSES ON AREAS LIKE RIGHT AGAINST ROADWAYS- REMOVING INVASIVE GRASSES UP WE KNOW A LOT OF IGNITION. OCCURS RIGHT ALONG THE ROADSIDE PEOPLE FLICKING A CIGARETTE OUT THE WINDOW- THIS IS NOT JUST LIGHTNING AND IT'S NOT JUST UTILITIES- THERE ARE OUR A LOT OF HUMAN. OF WILDFIRE AND WE HAD I THINK SIX OR- IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS IN OUR DISH IN IN MY BACKYARD THAT HAVE THANK GOD BEEN PUT DOWN BUT- THE WINDS OF SORT OF SAVED US ON THOSE. MORE COMING- SO WE THINK FOCUSING ON AVOIDING TYPE CONVERSION LOOKING AT ROADWAYS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SORT OF A CUTE AREAS OF RISK OR CRITICAL AND SO. WE'RE ALSO ADDING SOME OF THOSE ELEMENTS TO HOW THE STATE APPROACHES ITS FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY- I COULD TALK FOREVER ABOUT THIS I JUST APPRECIATE WITH WELFARE WORKING GROUP IS DONE IN THE SENATE. WHAT THE PRO TEM IS DONE IN PUSHING EARLY ACTION AND REALLY TRYING TO SAY WE CAN'T WAIT TILL NEXT FIRE SEASON TO MAKE THINGS MOVE SO I'M HOPING THIS BILL HELPS XCELERATED THAT EFFORT AND BUILD FURTHER PARTNERSHIPS. WITH THAT'LL YOU'LL TO UP TO MY SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE- TO THE FIRST ONE. IS HERE WITH US WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS I'M BOB BREMER SENIOR ENGINEER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED BY THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION INDICATE THEIR STRONG SUPPORT AS WELL- THE STATE ALREADY HAS OF FIRE SEVERITIES MAPS. FOR THE VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES- THE SENATORSBILL WOULD EXPAND THAT AND REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TO FINISH THE MAPS. FOR THE MODERATE IN THE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES AS SOON AS THAT GETS DONE- THE FIRE MARSHAL AND HCD WILL MOVE TO EXPAND APPLICATION. OF OUR FIRE HARDENING BUILDING STANDARDS- TO THE VERY TO THE HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES. AND ALSO CONSIDER. ADOPTING A- APPLICATION- TO THE MODERN ZONES AS WELL- THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE STANDARDS REALLY WORK- WHEN YOU HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMBINED WITH FIRE HARDENING BUILDING STANDARDS. THE HOMES HAVE ABOUT A THREE TO FOUR TIMES SURVIVABILITY RATE- ABOVE THOSE THAT DON'T. AND SO WITH THAT WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THE OTHER. LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS IS A RICK HASELEY OF THE CHAPARRAL INSTITUTE AND HE'S ON THE CO HOST PHONE LINE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATORS AND- THIS IS A RECALL THE FROM THE ALL THAT BROKE. IT AND- I JUST WANT TO SAY INTEREST RENT AND OWN INSURANCE SB. SIX THREE- YOU KNOW IF YOU'LL TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT IT EMPIRE. OR A FIRE IN YOUR HEART. AND WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO TO PREVENT RISK I'M GETTING TOO MUCH AND THAT IS YOU PUT STRAINS ON YOUR HARD ON THE SCREEN OVER YOUR CAMPFIRE. AND YOU DO THAT BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE EMBERS SHANKAR'S IN EIGHTY EMISSIONS MORALES. AND PATRICK COMPONENT WITH THIS BILL ADDRESSES EDIT ADDRESSES THE NEED TO REPLACE IT YOU'LL CENTER CROTCH. IT TO THE FARMERS REDUCTION AND ACTUALLY LOOKS AT THE THINGS THAT ACUALLY NINE HOMES. ACTUALLY EVERY HOME IN THE LAST TEN YEARS OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES HAS BEEN IGNITED. NEW TO EMBERS SENATOR STERN RT SAID. THE WAY YOU REDUCE VIRUS AND IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE FUEL CENTRING POSITION THAT. DOMINATES THE CONVERSATION NOW IN TERMS OF HAVING THAT CLARENCE LOGGING WHEN IN FACT WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING- THESE NUMBERS ARE TRAVELING A MILE OR MORE AND IF I HAVE A FIRE FRONT AS COPY PARK REVEALED IN THE TUBBS FIRE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DAMAGE IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS GOOD BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES NOT JUST THAT BUT IT GIVES SOME POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE. ONE IT DEALS WITH. YEAH THAT REDUCE THE FINAL OF DO AMBER'S NEVER BEEN ADDRESSED PEOPLE IT ALSO A PUBLIC EDUCATION- PROGRAM OR FUNDS AT EAST. TO HELP PEOPLE MAKE THEIR HOMES FIRE SAFE. AND IT ALSO DOES SOMETHING IS VERY IMPORTANT WHICH OKAY DARGAN WHO IS A FORMER FIRE MARSHALL HAS ALWAYS BEEN ADVOCATING IS NOT STANDARDIZED. FIRE RISK REDUCTION CHECKLIST. UNITIES WHICH INCLUDES NOT JUST EDUCATION AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE BUT IT TALKS ABOUT THE FLAMMABILITY OF THE HOME ITSELF WHICH IS WHY HOMES BURNED. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT ALSO. TERMS OF ACTIVATIONS AND SUCH THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN PROBLEMATIC IN A LOT OF THESE FIRES. THIS BILL PASCAL FIRE OR AT LEAST NOT CALIFORNIA BUT CALTRANS RATHER TO ACTUALLY BE PART OF THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF REDUCING FLAMMABILITY ALONG ROADWAYS. SOME OF THE PLANTATION THEN TAKEN FAX EDUCATION ACT KIND OF A THING ACTUALLY INCREASED FIRE RISK. SO HAVING THEM AT THE TABLE WILL REALLY HELP- AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE IT'S ALL ABOUT AMBER'S. IT'S NOT ABOUT HUNDRED PLAYING LINKS AND IN LOGGING POOREST. HABITAT IS ABOUT MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER MEMBERS. SO THANK YOU- SENATORS TURNED. CAUSING US.

AS YOU UP- TEN ALL THE LACK OF OPPOSITION BUT THERE'S ONE GLARING- ELEMENT OF THE BILL THAT I'M I'M REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME WITH. AND SO IF YOU MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT- ONE OF THE ELEMENTS AS IT ALLOWS A HOMEOWNER TO CLEAR THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY. TO MEET THE HUNDRED FOOT DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT WITH OUT. THAT NEIGHBORS PERMISSION- BACK IN- AND MY DISTRICT. WE'VE GOT PRETTY GOOD NEIGHBORS BUT- GOOD FENCES MAKE FOR GOOD NEIGHBORS.

YEAH I'M NOT A I'M LOOKING FOR THE BILL TAKES I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY PROVISION THAT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO GO ON TO ANYONE ELSE'S LAND THIS IS MORE ABOUT SORT OF STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT TWENTY JUST POINT POINT POINT IS IT AND WILL. WELL TO A LOOK. THIS WASN'T INTENDED TO BE- SOME BROADER. YEAH I DIDN'T THINK SO EITHER- OKAY I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH I DON'T HAVE THE- I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT. THE INTENT WAS MORE TO BE.

WE THIS WAS IT THIS WAS A HOLDOVER FROM THE END OF SESSION LAST YEAR HE GOT NO NO VOTES LEADING UP TO IT WAS A CASUALTY OF ALL THAT SO I'M HOPING WE COULD JUST KEEP THIS MOVING AND MAKE SOME REFORMS AND GET. GET CALIFORNIA TO RESILIENT PLACE SO THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'VE- OKAY. ARE WITH THE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. YOUR MOTIONS. IT'S A GREAT THE MOTION IS PASS THE FIRST BE RE RE TO THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSING. THAT'S FILE ITEM THREE SB SIXTY THREE LAYERED HI HI. JONES VOTING JONES NOT VOTING ALLEN. ALLEN HI A WIN. EGGMAN AYE. GROVE I HER. HI HIGHWAY. MON I LIMON A STERN I STERN HI AND THAT HAS ENOUGH BUT WE HOLD THE OF. AND I NOTICED HERTZBERG HASN'T THIRTY- ITEM O GO TO SO IF WE ARE STILL GOING AT THAT TIME I'M GONNA CALL THE ROLL ON ALL THE OUTSTANDING WANTS TO ALLOW HIM TO COME ON THE- MISTER CHAIR. JUST TO CLARIFY IF YOU DO END UP REOPENING THE ROLE DID YOU CLOSE THE ROLE AND THAT MEANT NO. OKAY I'M NOT CLOSE THE ROLE IN THE SINGLE MARKET PERFECT SO I WAS JUST GONNA SAY IT HAS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL ZONING. SO THAT SPECIFIC IN THE BILL JUST MR STERN IF YOU WANNA TALK TO MARK AROUND BECAUSE WE HAVE A MILLION. YEAH TO WORK HIS CENTER ALLEN ARE YOU READY TO PRESENT YOUR BILL ON DOWNS. I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS. THE WORKER TO MOVE THE FINAL. FIVE SB EIGHTY THREE. FROM SENATOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER. AND I MY UNDERSTAND WERE SUPPOSED TO. STATE OUR SEATS. ALREADY HERE THAT'S CORRECT ALL RIGHT SO. WE HEARD THIS- THE PRO TEM BUILD ON OUR SEA LEVEL RISE THIS REALLY TO THE- NINE. DON'T HAVE TO THE POINT ABOUT TIME THE THREAT THAT THIS ARE BOTH TO PEOPLE PROPERTIES AND OF COURSE THE FINANCIAL THREAT- THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY COULD BE AT RISK OF FLOODING BY TWENTY BY. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED. AND SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ESTIMATE STATEWIDE. SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ONE OF THE MANY CHALLENGES OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOW TO WITH WITH ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS. THEY'RE TRYING TO BALANCE A VERY LIMITED BUDGETS AND VERY FEW GOOD OPTIONS WITH THE NEEDS OF HOMEOWNERS. AND CLEAN AREAS ALREADY EXPERIENCING FLOODING BUYING OUT LOCAL RESIDENTS AND RELOCATING THEM IS VERY VERY CONTROVERSIAL AND IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW COST PROHIBITIVE. BUT SO OF COURSE IS THE EVER- AND ULTIMATELY LOSING BATTLE AGAINST THE C. HANSI WALLS- ARE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THE THEY WILL NEVER ALTERNATELY WIND- BUT THEY DO THEY'RE CERTAINLY A DECENT AS- HIM. BUT VERY VERY SHORT TERM ALTERNATIVE BUT- BUT THEY ALSO DO COME WITH SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES IN THOSE ARE OUTLINED. IN THE ANALYSIS. SO THE ONLY TIME THAT A FASCINATING SERIES ON THIS TOPIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT CITIES ARE FACING IN TOWNS UP AND DOWN OUR COAST. ARE VERY TOUGH CHOICES ABOUT THEIR BUT THE TOP OF THE CHOICES ARE GONNA GET A WHOLE LOT HARDER- WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE TO COVER PROPERTIES BANKS WILL PROVIDE MORTGAGES. TO A PROPERTIES THAT ARE AT RISK OF SEA LEVEL RISE AND SO YOU KNOW. WE I THINK BACK ON THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS TOPIC I THINK BACK. TO OTHER BIG CHALLENGES WHAT WHAT HOW MUCH YOU KNOW IN LIVES AND TREASURE WE COULD HAVE SAVED WE TAKE AN ACTION TWO DECADES AGO- TO TAKE STEPS TO LOWER THE RISK OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. AND SO SIMILAR SIMILAR TO FORWARD THINKING IDEA HERE THE IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUCK IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT POLITICAL PREDICAMENT. ASSOCIATED WITH AND WITH THE IDEA LIMITED CITY COFFERS AND- THE CHALLENGES OF PROTECTING PROPERTIES ON THE COAST WE WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH AN INNOVATIVE FINANCING OPTION. TO ALLEVIATE THE RISKS OF SEA LEVEL RISE TO THE PROPERTIES IN THEIR TOWNS. WHILE I PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS THE IDEAS WE HAVE A REVOLVING LOAN FUND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH THE AYE BACK. TO BRIBE PROPERTIES THAT WOULD BE THREATENED AND IN IT THERE WILL BE THREATENED IN A DECADE OR TWO OR THREE. ALLOWING THE OWNERS TO SELL WHILE THE HOUSE STILL HAS VALUE. AND THEN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN RENT OUT THE PROPERTY REPAYING THE LOAN AND PREVENTS POTENTIALLY EVEN EARNING REVENUE. AND THEN WHEN THE PROPERTIES AT RISK OF FLOODING FROM RISING SEA LEVELS THE HOUSE COULD BE DEMOLISHED OR RELOCATED. WITHOUT LOCAL RESIDENTS OR TAXPAYERS. DURING THE COST. SO WE'VE WE WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY REACHING OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS FOR FEEDBACK- AS THE MOUSE'S NOTES IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS I KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ADD MORE SPECIFICITY ANALYSIS ASK FOR IT WE GOT SOME GREAT SUGGESTIONS ALREADY FROM THE COASTAL COMMISSION- AND MANY OTHERS. HI I ALSO WANT TO DISCUSS THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS ENGAGEMENT ALREADY I'M I'M CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAFF AND INTERESTED MEMBERS AS WE GATHER FEEDBACK AND FURTHER WORK TO REFINE THE BILL- BUT ANYHOW I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JENNIFER SAVAGE WITH SURFRIDER FOUNDATION IS ABOUT AND SALAS POTTER WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHO ARE GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR LET'S MOVE TO THOSE- TWO. WITNESSES INSUPPORTABLE FROM THE CO HOST FROM ONE.

WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THE ENTIRE CLOSELY LEVIN DEPEND ON WHETHER DEVELOPED OR WILD WE MUST ALSO HELP OUR COMMUNITY LEVY AT THE RISK OF RISING OCEAN WHILE PROTECTING BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS AND NATURE. IN THEORY CONSIGNED TO COURT SHOWS 55% OF CALIFORNIA COASTAL HABITAT IS IN JEOPARDY ALL RIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT SB EIGHTY THREE WILL ALSO BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP ADDRESS THE CLIMATE IMPACTS TO HABITAT AND THE- FUNDING FROM THE AYE BANK COULD BE PRIORITIZED TO PROPERTIES THAT PROVIDE WILL PAY BENEFITS.

WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS. I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN THIS IMPRESSIVELY CHILI COMMITTEE ROOM. ON BEHALF OF S. B. TWO SIXTY SIX. IT IS A DISTRICT BILL WHICH WILL DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. TO INCORPORATE INTO CHINO HILLS STATE PARK THREE PARCELS OF LAND. THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR ACQUISITION AND PRESERVATION TO LOCAL CONSERVATION EFFORTS. AND FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS ALREADY BEEN SECURED NATURAL STATE PARK WHICH IS LOCATED PREDOMINANTLY IN MY DISTRICT. IS ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY STATE PARK UNITS MANAGED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION. IT IS LOCATED IN THE HILLS AROUND SANTA ANA CANYON INTHE COUNTY OF ORANGE RIVERSIDE AND SAN BERNARDINO THE PARK LIES WITHIN THE DENSE LOS ANGELES BASIN WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN A TWENTY FIVE MILE RADIUS AND ENJOYS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND VISITORS ANNUALLY. THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WOULD INSTRUCT PARKS TO RECEIVE AND INCORPORATE. INTO THE STATE PARK THREE JASON LAND PARCELS ALL WITH WILLING SELLERS OR DONORS THE LARGEST OF THE THREE PARCELS IS A TWELVE HUNDRED ACRE PARCEL KNOWN. AS THE FIRST NATIONAL INVESTMENT PROPERTIES. THIS OPEN SPACE PARCEL DO NOT CURRENTLY TECHNICALLY PART OF THE PARK FALLS WITHIN A PART OF THE PARK. DESIGNATED BY THE CHINO HILLS STATE PARK GENERAL PLAN AS A CORE HABITATS KNOWN. AS SUCH THIS OWN INCLUDE SENSITIVE WILDLIFE HABITATS THAT ARE CRUCIAL TO THE MOVEMENT AND SURVIVAL OF MANY PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES INDIGENOUS TO THE REGION. BUT PORTION OF THIS PARCELS CHARACTERIZES WALNUT WOODLAND ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S RARE AND IMPERILED NATURAL COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND OF THE THREE PARCELS IS A THREE HUNDRED ACRE PARCEL KNOWN AS CHINO HILLS THREE HUNDRED. IT IS SURROUNDED ON EITHER SIDE BY THE EXISTING PARK AND THE FIRST NATIONAL INVESTMENT PROPERTIES PARCEL. THIS PARCEL IS ALSO PART OF THE PARK'S GENERAL PLAN. THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS NATURAL OPEN SPACE ON. THE THIRD PARCEL IS AN ELEVEN ACRE WALNUT WOODLAND PARTIAL. KNOWN AS THE B. PROPERTY THIS PARCEL BORDERS THE PARK ON TWO SIDES AND ALSO IS LOCATED. WITHIN THE CORE HABITAT ZONE THE OWNER OF THIS PARCEL HAS COMMITTED TO CONVEYING THIS PARTIAL TO THE STATE FOR INCLUSION IN CHINO HILLS STATE PARK. AS A DONATION. THE TWO LARGER PARCELS REFERENCE YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED AS PRIORITY ACQUISITIONS FOR DECADES AS PART OF THE PARTS GENERAL PLAN. IF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE THESE PROPERTIES IS MISSED THESE PARCELS WITH MORE WITH MORE THAN LIKELY BE SOLD TO PRIVATE DEVELOPERS. INTERVENTIONAL DISPOSITIONAL HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE FUTURE CHARACTER OF THE PARK. AND THE EXPERIENCE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO VISIT THE PARK. FURTHERMORE ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CALIFORNIA HAS A LARGER NUMBER OF THREATENED SPECIES. THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE U. S. MENTION OF THE STATE PARK IS HOME TO MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED SPECIES OF BIRDS AND MAMMALS MANY REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS. THOUSANDS OF SPECIES OF INSECTS AS WELL AS ONE OF THE PLAN COMMITTEES SEVERAL WHICH ARE DEEMED THREATEN TO DANGER SPECIALLY PROTECTED. ACQUISITION OF THE THREE PARCELS OF LAND WILL AVOID THE PROSPECT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION. THE LEADING CAUSE OF SPECIES ENDANGERMENT OR EXTINCTION. AS I NOTICED AT THE OUTSET NO ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND OR OTHER PUBLIC COUNTS. WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE INCORPORATION OF ANY OF THESE PARCELS INTO THE PARK. ONE OF THE PARCELS IS A DONATION AN EXISTING FEDERAL STATE AND PRIVATE FUNDING SOURCES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR THE ACQUISITION. OF THE OTHER TWO PARCELS. WITH ME TODAY IS. SHE BACK HILLS FOR.

THE VITAL LOCAL ISSUE AFFECTING MY COMMUNITY IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE A MINE IN THE SOLID THAT CANYON.
