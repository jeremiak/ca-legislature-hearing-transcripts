00:40:45.843 --> 00:40:48.078
AS BEEN CHANGED IN SO MANY

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:50.014
WONDERFUL INCREDIBLE WAYS BY THE

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.316
MAGIC OF THE INTERNET.

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.884
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY GENIUS OF SO

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.753
MANY.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.822
HAS MET SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

00:40:57.888 --> 00:41:00.024
THAT WE NOW TRY TO DEAL WITH IN

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.359
THIS LEGISLATION OTHERS AROUND

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:04.562
THE GLOBE OF SOUGHT TO DEAL WITH.

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.397
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.865
IDEAS THAT ARE OUT OF THE

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.967
CONTRACT YOU AND LEARN THINGS

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:11.468
ABOUT YOU ON THE ONE HAND THAT

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.636
PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.805
EXTRAORDINARY SERVICE.

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:16.307
BY THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.175
PROVIDES INFORMATION ACCESS THE

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.610
PEOPLE ON HEARD OF IN HUMAN

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.478
HISTORY.

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:22.446
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY CREATE

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:24.849
CHALLENGES THE ROLE OF

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:25.449
GOVERNMENT.

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.351
OFTEN WHEN THOSE KINDS OF

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.752
TENSIONS ARE MET IS TO MEDIATE

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.688
THOSE CHALLENGES.

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.389
HOW WE GOT HERE THROUGH THE

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:34.358
INSPIRATION AND GENIUS OF THE

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:35.626
PERSON WHO CHOSE [inaudible]

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.995
TO GET ENGAGED THE FRUSTRATION

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.231
THAT'S CAUSED BY SO MANY THAT BR

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:41.866
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IS A

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.400
PROCESS THAT ONE PERSON CAN

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.469
LEVERAGE THE PROCESS.

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:46.904
BUT THAT HAS BEEN THE HISTORY OF

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:49.139
DEMOCRACY ALL ALONG.

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.875
EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE AROUND THE

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.076
GLOBE THERE HAVE BEEN A SMALL

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:54.144
GROUP OF PEOPLE STOOD UP.

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:55.112
THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME IN THE

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.413
RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GOT

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.481
ATTENTION IN ORDER TO SOLVE A

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:58.983
PROBLEM.

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.618
SO I THINK THAT AS WE HEAR IN

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:02.286
THIS BUILDING IN THIS BUBBLE

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:05.222
OFTEN GET CONSUMED BY OUR OWN

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:05.522
[inaudible]

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.424
IMAGINATION.

00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:08.659
THERE'S A LARGER PICTURE OUT

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:09.660
THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:12.363
TRYING TO DO. ONE OF THE REASONS

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.531
WHY INDUSTRY HAS THE HESITATION

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:15.866
IS THAT THEY DO WAS OUR SPHERE

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:17.368
OF THAT.

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:20.638
PRECEDENT THAT WILL BE SAID HERE.

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:21.772
CAN BE IT CAN SPREAD ACROSS

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.008
OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN OTHER

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:24.308
COUNTRIES.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.844
OTHER STATES.

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.646
AND THE RIGHT I THINK IT WILL.

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.714
AND I THINK THEIR THEIR RIGHT TO

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.750
DO THAT SO WHAT DID WE DO.

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:34.285
WE EXPANDED I THINK I IN A

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:36.487
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY WHAT WAS

00:42:36.553 --> 00:42:38.355
BUILT ON BY MR MCTAGGART.

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:40.157
EQ YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:41.225
TODAY BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE A

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:42.526
CAMPAIGN IF THIS DOESN'T PASS SO

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:43.794
HE'S GOT US DEFEND THE STATUS

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:44.628
QUO.

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:45.763
BUT I'M HOPING THAT HE CHANGED

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.231
HIS TUNE.

00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:49.066
AFTER THE FACT IN TO EXPRESS HOW

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.135
IMPORTANT THIS IS.

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.703
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY AS WE

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.838
EVIDENCE TO SENSITIVITY TO SO

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:55.773
MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:57.474
RAISED BY IS NOT A TIME I WALK

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.810
DOWN THE HALL AT GERMAN HERE

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.577
TALKS DOWN THE HALL [inaudible]

00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:03.080
DODD.

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:03.714
SAY CAN YOU FIX THIS CAN YOU FIX

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.049
THAT.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:05.983
THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEING

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.618
ASKED TO FIX OUR SMALL TECHNICAL

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:08.752
QUESTIONS THAT RELATE TO

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.487
INDUSTRY IN LARGE MEASURE.

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:12.756
WHAT I FIND SO ENCOURAGING IS AT

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:13.824
ALL LEVELS FROM ALL THE BIGGEST

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:15.592
COMPANIES?

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:17.061
THEY GET THEY UNDERSTAND WITH

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.162
THIS FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTS THEIR

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:19.730
CUSTOMER.

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:21.332
THERE OKAY WITH IT BUT THERE'S

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.967
SOME ISSUES AS TO THEIR BUSINESS

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:24.802
MODELS OF SOME OTHER ISSUES THAT

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.704
PART PROVIDES CHALLENGES QUITE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.204
FRANKLY.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:29.540
AND THAT'S RIGHT IF WHEN YOU

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:30.341
TALK TO THIS GOOD DID IT DO

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:31.842
DISTRICT COMMITTEE.

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.410
IN THE OTHER HOUSE AT NEW JIVE

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:34.611
BUT TALKING TO THEIR FORMER

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.347
STAFFER WHO STEPS THIS COMMITTEE

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.448
NOW.

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:38.983
IT IS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO OVER

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:40.384
THERE IS CORRECT THE LAW WE

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.552
DON'T CORRECTED BECAUSE WERE

00:43:41.618 --> 00:43:42.753
WRONG WE CORRECTED BECAUSE THE

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.621
WORLD CHANGES.

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:45.889
AS I SAID YESTERDAY BRIEFLY THE

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.458
NOTION OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:49.560
CAME IN THE GRISWOLD CASE IN

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:51.395
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE COUNCIL.

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:51.996
THAT WHERE --

00:43:52.062 --> 00:43:53.764
JUSTICE OR A BILL DOUGLAS CAME

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.599
UP WITH THIS NOTION WAS EXTENDED

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.434
BY DURAN CHAU WHO WROTE IT INTO

00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.970
THE CONSTITUTION IN NINETEEN

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:01.405
SEVENTY TWO OF CALIFORNIA.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.873
BUT THOSE WERE BROAD CONCEPTS

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.807
TRYING TO EXTEND WHAT THE

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:06.210
CONSTITUTION MET ON THE ONE HAND.

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:08.112
AND THE OTHER HAND AS WE HAVE

00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:10.414
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY CREATES THE

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:11.815
KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:13.717
GOVERNMENT WAS INTENDED. TO

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:17.588
DESIGN FOR SO I JUST WANNA.

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:19.323
SPIKE THE BUMPS AND BRUISES THE

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.858
TEST OF COURSE.

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.826
IS MAYBE TO SOME EXTENT HOW WE

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.094
GOT HERE.

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.496
THOSE REQUIRE A DISCUSSION FOR A

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.431
DIFFERENT DAY.

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:30.501
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS TOMORROW.

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.369
AFTER THIS LAWS IMPLEMENTED HAVE

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:34.405
WE DONE SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:35.472
HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT AND

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.907
INNOVATION ON THE ONE HAND.

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:38.175
AND YET MEETS THE VERY

00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:39.777
LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.145
WITH RESPECT TO WHAT PRIVACY

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.479
MEANS ON THE OTHER.

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.448
I'M TELLING YOU I THINK IT DOES.

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.783
I'M TELLING YOU OVER IN ART FOR

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:48.218
THIS PROCESS WAS THE PRODUCT IS

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:50.087
BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER

00:44:50.154 --> 00:44:51.755
THAN THE STATUS QUO.

00:44:51.822 --> 00:44:52.456
THAT IN MY JUDGMENT NO

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.758
DISRESPECT A PRODUCT BY ORDERS

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.061
OF MAGNITUDE IS BETTER THAN WHAT

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.996
THE INITIATIVE WAS.

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.564
IT WAS INSPIRED BY OUR HONEST

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.832
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH A

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:04.468
VERY DIFFICULT AREA OF THE LAW.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.537
BUT WE FELT THAT THIS PROCESS OF

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.172
THE LAST THREE MONTHS HAS

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:09.573
INFORMED THIS IN A WAY THAT IS

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.208
GOOD.

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:12.776
I WANT.

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.778
TO GIVE ROCKSTAR ACCOLADES TO

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:16.413
THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE.

AND THE WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THIS

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:43.841
HAPPEN WITHOUT MISTER DODD THIS

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.543

ONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.338
GUIDELINES FOR FAIR INFORMATION

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:50.440
PRACTICE PRINCIPLES OR FIPS.

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:51.374
DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:52.442
SEVENTIES IN RESPONSE TO

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:53.577
CONCERNS ABOUT DATA BASES HELD

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.679
ON MAINFRAMES.

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:56.446
THESE PRINCIPLES ARE KNOWN AS

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.718
AND THEY'VE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:10.460
YET THESE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:21.771

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:25.108

ISSUE OF OUR DESIRE.

00:56:59.115 --> 00:56:59.983
NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:01.684
CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:02.519
TO LEAD IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:08.158
PRACTICES WERE.

00:57:08.224 --> 00:57:09.926
WELL AS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:11.361
WHEN FORGERY SOON REALIZE THAT

00:57:11.427 --> 00:57:12.562
MOST CONSUMERS DON'T ACTUALLY

WEEK PRIVACY POLICIES.

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:15.131
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN IF

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.933
THEY DID THAT LITTLE CHOICE IN

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:17.500
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:18.535

COMPANY'S PRACTICES DID A MARKET

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.870
FAILURE.

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:21.771
THIS MY THE MEASURES TODAY ARE

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.840
SO CRITICAL.

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.942
LAST FALL I HOPE MR RETARDED

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.043

THOSE PROVISIONS WE OUTLINED IN

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.083
THAT INITIATIVE ARE INCLUDED IN

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.653
AB TWO SEVEN FIVE TODAY.

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:37.587
SPECIFICALLY THE ABILITY FOR

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:40.657

OR INFERRED ABOUT THEM.

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.760
AND GENERALLY WHERE WAS OBTAINED

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.228
AND WHOM IT WAS SHARED WITH IS

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:47.530
AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:48.631
MORE SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER IS THE

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:49.699
ABILITY TO ALLOW CONSUMERS TO

00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:50.867
OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR

00:57:50.934 --> 00:57:52.101
DATA SOMETHING THAT CONSUMERS

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:53.937
HAVE OFTEN ASKED FOR BUT HAVE

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:55.872
NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO.

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:56.673
THE RIGHT TO DELETE DATA

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.274
ADDITIONALLY WHEN CONSUMER NO

00:57:58.341 --> 00:57:59.375
LONGER WANTS TO USE A SERVICE

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:01.177
WILL ALSO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY IN

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:03.379
REDUCING HARM TO CONSUMERS AND

00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:05.481
COMPANIES EXPERIENCE DATA WHICH

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.683
NO MORE INSTANCES OF YOUR DATA

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.417
BEING.

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:08.785
NOT LEAK FROM A SERVICE YOU HAVE

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:11.321
IN USE IN A DECADE.

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.388
THE BILL WOULD OPT OUT INTO THE

00:58:12.455 --> 00:58:13.189
ONE SIMPLY HELP PROTECT

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.858
CONSUMERS BUT IT'S MY OPINION

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.359
THAT WILL SPUR INNOVATION AND

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:17.527
THE WAY COMPANIES MONETIZE THE

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:20.263
SERVICES THEY NOW OFFER.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.431
INCENTIVIZE CLEAN COMES SORRY

00:58:21.497 --> 00:58:22.765
INCENTIVIZING COMPANIES WITH

WHOM CHO CONSUMERS HAVE A

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.702

LEFT LITTLE ROOM FOR MEANINGFUL

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:36.305
POLICY NEGOTIATION.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.607
WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:39.008
A BILL THAT STANCE IMPACTS

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.376
NEARLY EVERY CALIFORNIA BUSINESS

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.845
AND CONSUMER.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:43.679
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS VERY

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:45.615
BROAD AND IT'S NOT MONOLITHIC

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:46.949
AND MANY IMPACTED PARTIES HAVE

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:47.483
NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:48.684
PROCESS.

01:04:48.751 --> 01:04:50.219
ADDITIONALLY MOST OF US ON THIS

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:51.621
LEGISLATION FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:52.655
I'M ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:54.190
WORLD WHEN IT CAME INTO PRINT ON

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:55.258
THURSDAY.

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:55.825
AND WE WERE TOLD TAKE IT OR

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.126
LEAVE IT.

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:58.561
DESPITE THAT NO AMENDMENTS WERE

01:04:58.628 --> 01:04:59.428
PUT INTO PRINT MONDAY MORNING

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.863
EXPANDING LIABILITY IN WHAT IS

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.098
SUPPOSED TO BE THE DATA BREACH

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.599
SECTION OF THIS BILL AND THEY

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:04.934
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PRIVACY

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:05.668
THEY'RE JUST ADDITIONAL

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.770
GIVEAWAYS TO TRIAL ATTORNEYS.

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:08.838
WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS OF THE

01:05:08.904 --> 01:05:09.805
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THIS

01:05:09.872 --> 01:05:10.806
BILL BECAUSE IT EXPOSES

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.541
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO MASSIVE

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:13.976
ADDITIONAL LIABILITY.

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:14.443
AND BASED ON THESE NEW

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.845
AMENDMENTS.

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:17.046
THAT LIABILITY WILL PIE

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:18.314
SITUATIONS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.649
AS DATA BREACHES UNDER CURRENT

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:20.883
CALIFORNIA LAW.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.451
A LAW THAT IS ALREADY ONE OF THE

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.320
MOST AGGRESSIVE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.221
MOREOVER THE NEW AMENDMENTS

01:05:25.288 --> 01:05:26.422
REMOVED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD HAVE

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:27.690
CARVED OUT SMALLER BUSINESSES

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:28.891
FROM LIABILITY UNDER THE PRIVATE

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.860
RIGHT OF ACTION ON TOP OF THAT.

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.128
THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR SIGNIFICANT

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.929
STATUTORY DAMAGES TO BE AWARDED

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:35.298
WITH NO PROOF OF ANY INJURY.

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.465
TIME AND AGAIN WE'VE HEARD THAT

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:38.134
IF COMPANIES ARE GOOD ACTORS

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:38.968
THEY WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:40.002
THIS LAW.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.370
THAT SIMPLY NOT TRUE WITH THIS

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.738
LAW MEANS THAT SOON AS THE

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.507
COMPANY SUFFERS A DATA BREACH OR

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:45.174
AGAIN WITH THIS LANGUAGE

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:46.409
SOMETHING MORE THEY WILL BE

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.677
SLAPPED WITH A LAWSUIT.

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.111
AND A WORLD WHERE NO PROOF OF

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:50.813
INJURY IS REQUIRED TO BE ON THE

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.315
HOOK FOR HUGE STATUTORY DAMAGES

01:05:52.381 --> 01:05:53.082
MANY COMPANIES WILL BE

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:53.949
LEVERAGING TO IMMEDIATE

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.851
SETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:56.419
STRENGTH OF THEIR DEFENSE AT

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:57.987
TRIAL. FOR THOSE REASONS SUCH

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:59.055
CAN'T CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.289
IDENTIFIED SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:01.957
ANOTHER BILL THIS YEAR.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:02.892
S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AS A JOB

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:05.728
KILLER.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.662
YET.

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.030
DESPITE HER OBJECTIONS TO THE

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.765
MASSIVE INCREASE RELIABILITY OF

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:11.267
THIS BILL AND OTHER PROBLEMS

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:12.702
WITH THE LEGISLATION.

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.136
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ISN'T AN

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.738
UNTENABLE SITUATION.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.406
ALTHOUGH EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:18.674
FIVE IS DEEPLY FLAWED THE

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:21.243
PRIVACY INITIATIVE IS MUCH WORSE.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.812
AND THE STAKES ARE ASTRONOMICAL

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.080
BECAUSE IF THE INITIATIVE IS

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.581
PASSED THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.716
VIRTUALLY UNABLE TO AMEND THE

01:06:26.782 --> 01:06:28.451
LAW ON THE FUTURE.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.418
THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BOTH BECAUSE

01:06:29.485 --> 01:06:30.653
OF THE SIGNIFICANT FLAWS IN THE

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.221
INITIATIVE AND BECAUSE WE WOULD

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:33.489
HAVE TO REJECT RETURN TO A VOTE

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.990
OF THE PUBLIC IN ORDER TO CHANGE

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.659
THE LAW AN AREA WHERE BUSINESSES.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:37.727
AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE CONSTANTLY

01:06:37.793 --> 01:06:39.462
EVOLVING.

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:40.096
THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD OUTCOME

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.364
FOR ANYONE.

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:42.865
SO AT THIS LATE HOUR WE PREFER

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:43.466
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO THE

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.768
INITIATIVE.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.103
THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.337
AND REMAINS DEDICATED TO

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.705
CRAFTING REASONABLE PRIVACY

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.474
LEGISLATION WE STRONGLY URGE THE

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.808
LEGISLATURE TO FIX THE NUMEROUS

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:54.043
PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY THIS BILL

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.578
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:56.345
THESE INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.880
LIMITED.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.048
TO THAT LANGUAGE IN MANY PARTS

01:06:59.115 --> 01:07:00.449
OF THE BILL IS CONFUSING IT

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.550
COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR

01:07:01.617 --> 01:07:02.418
BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS

01:07:02.485 --> 01:07:03.686
UNDERSTAND THAT WILL CERTAINLY

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:06.155
LEAD TO MORE LITIGATION --

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.423
I PARTY TOUCH ON SOME OF THE

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.224
PROBLEMS WITH THE PRIVATE RIGHT

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.425
OF ACTION BUT THERE'S ONE

01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:10.726
ADDITIONAL POINT TO BE RAISED

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.061
ADAM THE USE OF THE WORDS

01:07:12.128 --> 01:07:13.329
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE LEAVES

01:07:13.396 --> 01:07:14.363
OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT A

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.031
VIOLATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:16.799
BILL.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:17.600
COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THIS

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.667
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.102
EXAMPLE THE CUSTOMER OPTS OUT OF

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:21.570
THIRD PARTY DATA SHARING AND

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:22.872
COMPANY MISTAKENLY SHARES IT

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.106
WITH A THIRD PARTY.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.274
ARGUABLY THAT COULD BE

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:25.975
CONSIDERED UNAUTHORIZED

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.476
DISCLOSURE AND THERE'S NOTHING

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:28.344
IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.346
BUILT EXPLICITLY PREVENT SUCH AN

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:31.247
INTERPRETATION.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:32.615
ALTHOUGH STATEMENT WAS MADE IN

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.083
YESTERDAY'S HEARING --

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.351
AND THERE'S APPARENTLY A LETTER

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:37.086
TO THAT EFFECT THERE'S NO INTENT

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.654
TO APPLY THE DATA BREACH PRIVATE

01:07:38.721 --> 01:07:40.456
RIGHT OF ACTION THE OTHER PARTS

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:42.591
OF THE BILL --

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:44.226
WE I DON'T RECALL HEARING A

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.295
COMMITMENT MADE ON THE RECORD --

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:47.196
TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE BEFORE THE

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:48.264
LAW -- TAKES

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.665
THE FACT AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.934
WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.569
FINALLY I WANT TO RAISE A FEW OF

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:54.770
THE EXAMPLES OF THE MANY

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:55.905
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:56.505
BILL.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.006
THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.741
APPRECIATE.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:07:59.975
THIS BILL COULD JEOPARDIZE THE

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:00.976
ABILITY OF RETAILERS PROVIDE

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.077
LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS TO

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.679
CUSTOMERS.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.580
IT COULD PREVENT COMPANIES ROTH

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.016
ACTUATING PRODUCT SAFETY RECALLS.

01:08:07.082 --> 01:08:08.184
IT COULD IMPACT THE THIRD PARTY

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.552
SHARING OF DATA FOR FRAUD

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.120
PREVENTION AND DETECTION.

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:12.154
AND SOME OF THE DISCLOSURE

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.289
REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL COULD

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:14.690
BE READ TO FORCE COMPANIES TO

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:15.958
REDUCE INFORMATION ABOUT ONE

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:17.359
CONSUMER TO ANOTHER.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.561
WHICH GOES AGAINST THE PRIVACY

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.030
BECAUSE OF THIS LEGISLATION.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.398
AGAIN THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:23.466
NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:25.034
AND FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.936
WE ARE POSED AB THREE SEVENTY

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:27.803
FIVE BUT ULTIMATELY.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:28.938
WE MAINTAIN A PREFERENCE FOR

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:30.439
THIS LEGISLATION OVER THE BALLOT

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:31.006
INITIATIVE BECAUSE IT IS FAR

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:34.243
WORSE.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:36.178
THANK YOU MISTER MCKINLEY

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:36.479

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.981
THANK YOU FINANCE KEVIN KELLY

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.850
WITH INTERNET DISSOCIATION THIS

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.718
BEEN A DIFFICULT PROCESS.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.119
AND WE HAVE MANY SUBSTANTIVE

01:08:44.186 --> 01:08:45.087
POLICY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.522
PROPOSAL.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:48.090
HOWEVER WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.925
LEGISLATORS EFFORTS TO TAKE THIS

01:08:49.992 --> 01:08:51.327
IMPORTANT COMPLICATED DISCUSSION

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:52.528
WAY FOR THE BALLOT BOX AND BRING

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.163
IT IN WARM PART.

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:54.663
APPROPRIATE VENUE OF THE

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.198
LEGISLATURE.

01:08:56.265 --> 01:08:57.666
AS CAL CHAMBER MENTIONED DATA

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:58.501
REGULATION POLICIES HIGHLY

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.102
COMPLEX.

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.337
AND IMPACTS NEARLY EVERY SECTOR

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.371
OF THE ECONOMY INCLUDING THE

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.106
INTERNET INDUSTRY.

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:05.975
IF THE INITIATIVE BECAME LAW THE

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:07.376
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE VIRTUALLY

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.644
UNABLE TO AMEND ITS PROVISIONS

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:10.112
GOING FORWARD.

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.247
A DANGEROUS PROSPECT GIVEN HOW

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.482
NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE THE STATE

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:14.049
MUST BE IN ITS POLICIES TO

01:09:14.116 --> 01:09:15.251
ENSURE.

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:16.185
WE REMAIN A GLOBAL LEADER

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.953
INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.088
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.656
WITH THE LEGISLATURE MOVING

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.824

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.295
THING WAS KELLY WE ALSO HAVE

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:01.823
I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.325
DISCUSSION FOR US TO BE HAVING

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.127
IN A STATE THAT'S THE BIRTHPLACE

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.161
OF A LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.863
USE THIS DATA.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.665
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE PART

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:11.667
OF SHAPING PRIVACY POLICY FOR

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.001
THE ENTIRE NATION AND MAYBE THE

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.403
WORLD FOR OTHER COMING.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:15.470
BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S VERY

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:16.538
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE HAVING

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:19.174
THIS DISCUSSION AS A LEGISLATURE

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.343
AND I DEEP CONCERNS WITH THE

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.811
INITIATIVE MOVING FORWARD OF MR

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:24.246
MCTAGGART IT'S NICE TO SEE NOT

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.681
UNDER LESS ADVERSARIAL

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:26.815
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.051
WE HAD A ROBUST DEBATE ABOUT THE

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.085
INITIATIVE.

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:31.320
PA THE INITIATIVES COMMITTEE AT

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:32.654
OUR PARTY CONVENTION.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.523
A I DO HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:36.091
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT'S GREAT THAT

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:36.758
WE'RE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION AS

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:37.759
A LEGISLATURE I THINK IT'S

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.194
APPROPRIATE ARE IT'S VERY

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.729
ABBREVIATED JUST BECAUSE OF KIND

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.630
OF THE ARTIFICIAL DEADLINES

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.465
IMPOSED BY.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.766
THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE INITIATIVE

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.935
SO ARE.

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:48.904
IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX TOPIC AND I

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:49.738
THINK IF YOU LOOK AT HOW

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.340
VOLUMINOUS THE BILL ALREADY IS

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.441
IT'S VERY CLEAR.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.309
THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.644
ATTENTION TO DETAIL TO GET THIS

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.245
EXACTLY RIGHT SO WE GOT TO

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.947
BLATANT IMPLEMENTATION IN HERE

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.482
WHICH IS GOOD GIVES US ALL THE

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:01.383
TIME TO WORK THROUGH.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.460
INEVITABLE IMPLEMENTATION

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:12.861

IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD

01:20:58.920 --> 01:20:59.588

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:00.789
WORKED VERY HEAVILY ON THIS

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:01.923
PROCESS TO CREATED IN THE FIRST

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.991
PLACE.

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.226
AND WANTED TO GET --

01:21:04.292 --> 01:21:06.127
HEARINGS DONE WAS HIT WITHIN

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:06.928
THIRTY DAYS AFTER 25% KNOWS

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:08.029
WHICH THEN WOULD HAVE.

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.699
MOVE THIS FORWARD.

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:13.501
THIS VERY HUMAN ANSWER TO THIS.

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:14.936
FIRST OF THE GIVEN THE THOUGHT

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:15.503
WE'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.471
DONE.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:17.606
I JUST DON'T THINK ANYBODY

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.207
THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE.

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:20.208
AND I DON'T THINK THERE WAS REAL

01:21:20.275 --> 01:21:21.409
SERIOUSNESS OF PURPOSE BECAUSE

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.179
OF THAT [inaudible] TO THE

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:26.381
NATURE OF ADVOCATES OF WHICH I

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.383
AS A LAWYER M..

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.819
EAST ARGUE FEW YOUR INTERESTS.

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:32.320
AND SO WHAT WE SAW AS WE

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.289
CONTINUALLY WERE FRUSTRATED

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:36.157
ASKING EVERYBODY UNDER THE SUN

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.926
GIVE IMPORTS WE HAD ADVOCACY.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.861
WOULDN'T GET SOLUTIONS WE CAN

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.197
GET COMPROMISE.

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:43.064
PARTLY BECAUSE IT THINK IT WAS

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:44.299
IN THE GET DONE AND PARTLY

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.300
BECAUSE OF THAT INCIDENT BURKE

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:47.369
AT THE CLOCK.

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.137
IT IMPOSED UPON US WE FELT THAT

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.272
NO MORAL OBLIGATION TO INCLUDE

01:21:50.338 --> 01:21:50.905
AS MANY [inaudible]

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:52.907
WE COULD.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.309
I THINK IT WAS SAID HERE'S THAT

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:55.010
WOULD LOBBY GROUPS THAT PROBABLY

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:56.478
DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THEMSELVES

01:21:56.544 --> 01:21:57.579
AS PART OF THIS DISCUSSION

01:21:57.646 --> 01:21:58.647
BECAUSE IT WAS GENERALLY.

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:00.215
ARM.

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:02.450
A A COUCH IN THE FORM OF TECH.

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:03.318
AND THERE ISN'T MUCH BROADER

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:04.286
AFFECT WE LOOKED AT THE

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.388
RETAILERS OR AS A LOT OF A A

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.956
FOCUSES SMALLER BUSINESSES NOW

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.557
THE TWENTY FIVE MADE ARE CUT OFF

01:22:09.624 --> 01:22:11.259
BUT STILL SOMEONE COULD BE.

01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:11.993
IN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.261
WHATEVER NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF

01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:16.131
TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION SO

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:16.665
IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:17.632
HOMEWORK THERE.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.034
SO WHAT WE DID WAS IS

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.969
RESPONSIBLE LEGISLATORS TRYING

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:23.305
TO BALANCE OUT THIS CHALLENGE.

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.840
ON ON THE ONE HAND ARE AND ON

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:27.409
THE OTHER HAND TRY TO REALIZE

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:29.044
THAT THERE WOULD BE LEGITIMATE

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.046
ISSUES THERE ALWAYS ARE MENTION

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.213
MY OPENING COMMENTS.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.415

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.160
GRAPPLING WITH WHAT WE DO WITH

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:47.329
FAX MACHINES CAN WE TAKE A FACT

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:48.630
SIGNATURE AND HOW DO YOU GET

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:49.831
PAST THAT WHAT SIGNATURE ON A

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:50.765
DOCUMENT.

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.400
THINGS THAT TODAY WE TAKE FOR

01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:54.402
GRANTED AND YET YEARS AGO THEY

01:22:54.469 --> 01:22:56.171
WERE HUGE ISSUES ABOUT WHAT THAT

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:56.938
LOOKS LIKE IT HOW WE

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.440
AUTHENTICATE DOCUMENTS AND ALL

01:22:58.506 --> 01:22:59.174

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.507
THE LEADERSHIP YET BUT THE IDEA

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.042

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:08.109
SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.878
THAT YOU HAD.

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:10.545
ALL ONE HAS TO DO IS LOOK AT THE

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:12.580
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE

01:24:12.647 --> 01:24:13.681
IN THE INITIATIVE WHICH IS JUST

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.383
A COUPLE PAGES LONG.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:15.984

CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I REALLY

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.763
HOPE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.331
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS IN THE

BEFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.335
OF THIS BILL THERE IS THAT WE

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.204
DON'T EXPAND THE PRIVATE RIGHT

01:24:36.271 --> 01:24:37.405
OF ACTION IN THIS BILL TO DATA

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.607
BREACHES THAT ARE UNRELATED TO

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.242

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.015
HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN WORK ON THAT

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.516
MOVING FORWARD BUT I WANT TO

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.150

CAN SOMETIMES BE REALLY BAD AND

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:06.868
ONE OF THE THINGS I HOPE WE WILL

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.736
LOOK FOR IS WHAT AND SAID I'M

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.538
HEARING A VERY AUTHENTIC

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:11.406

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:12.407
THOSE.

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.375
PROVISIONS THAT ONCE THAT I AM I

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.944

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:16.744
THAT THERE CAN BE AN AGREEMENT

01:25:16.811 --> 01:25:17.712

RIGHT OF ACTION THAT CAN MAKE.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:25.119
WELL INTENTIONED LEGISLATION

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:27.121
COST SO MUCH EXPONENTIALLY MORE

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:30.425
AND HAVE REALLY BAD CONSEQUENCES --

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:32.060
AND SO I AYE ECHO THAT.

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:34.696
THE OTHER HAS TO DO WITH THE M.

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.231
NEWSPAPER PUBLICATION COMMENT.

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:39.701
NEW TECHNOLOGY WE ALSO HAVE NEW

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:42.770
OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE VICTIMS AS

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:46.741
PARTICULAR EXAMPLE THAT WAS

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.543
RAISED IS NOT WHAT I HEARD

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.112
BEFORE IT DOES ADAM.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:52.680
BECAUSE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.516
A WE MAY HAVE.

01:25:54.582 --> 01:25:57.318
A A PROBLEM OF FINDING OUT HOW

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:59.387
THOSE YOU CAN CAUSE CRIME ME NO

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.856
I DON'T SEE A RECOGNIZED FACE OF

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:02.991
SAY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OF

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:04.259
POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION OR

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.760
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY

ALSO BE PART OF UNDERSTANDING

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.563
WHAT WE DO WITH DATA BUT I

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:09.731

ON THAT WHEN I HAVE ONE MORE

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:12.000

ON SHARE ARE WHO WE ARE MINDFUL

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:18.039
OF OF EVERYONE WHEN WE DRAFTED

01:26:18.106 --> 01:26:19.908
THE THE LANGUAGE INTO.

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:21.976
A WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:24.479
INSERTED INTO A LANGUAGE THAT --

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.147

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:52.473
OUR DISA HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:55.944
DELETION CONTACTS IN AND OUT THE

01:26:56.010 --> 01:26:57.779

MANY OF THESE ARE POTENTIAL

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.400
