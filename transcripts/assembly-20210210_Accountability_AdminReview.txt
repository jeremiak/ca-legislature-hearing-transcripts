AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S VACCINE ROLLOUT STIR STRATEGY FROM HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE FROM OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND FROM FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS TODAY OUR GOAL IS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS UPDATE. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE STATUS OF VACCINE DISTRIBUTION. OUR GOALS FOR CALIFORNIA THE PLAN TO GET US THERE AND SPECIFICALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S NEW DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH BLUE SHIELD. FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THE COVER NINETEEN VACCINE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT DISTRIBUTION IS SWIFT SAFE AND EQUITABLE SO THAT WE CAN DEFEAT THIS PANDEMIC AND BEGIN THE REPORT OF REBUILDING CALIFORNIA. THANKS I'LL HAND IT OVER TO MY CO CHAIR FOR TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATRICK. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME EVERYONE FOR JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON LOOKING FOR TO CANDID AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION. THEM FIRST LIKE MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATRICK RECHARGE FOR CODE SHARING THIS TURN ON THE STATUS OF STATUS OF CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO DISTRIBUTE THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE. I THINK ALL OF US CAN AGREE THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROVIDE VACCINES TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS A THIRTY YEAR VETERAN OF RICH MEDICAL SERVICES THE FATHER OF A SON WHO'S A DEPUTY SHERIFF AND A DAUGHTER WHO IS A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE CHALLENGES ARE FIRST RESPONDERS AND FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE. BEEN FACING ON A DAILY BASIS THROUGHOUT MY CAREER I'VE BEEN A CHOPPER PROVIDING THE TRAINING RESOURCES AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THESE EVERYDAY HEROES NEED TO SAVE LIVES AND KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. READ THE MINISTRATION AND BUILT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OF DIRECTION IN ITS APPROACH TO DELIVERING AND ADMINISTERING VACCINES ACROSS THE STATE. THE STATE HAS CONTRACTED WITH CRUCIAL TO ALLOCATE VACCINES DIRECTLY TO PROVIDERS. THAT EFFORT TO IMPROVE DISTRIBUTION EFFICIENCY. AND PROVIDE THE STATE WITH THE BETTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AS A PERMANENT JERRY WILL ALSO RUN A SEPARATE VACCINATION PROGRAM FOR NINE MILLION MEMBERS. ADMINSTRATION ALSO STATED ITS GOAL OF SIMPLIFYING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR VACCINES SO. THAT HEALTHCARE WORKERS INDIVIDUAL SIXTY FIVE AND OVER EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WORKERS WILL ALSO BE ELIGIBLE START MAKING APPOINTMENTS TO BE VACCINATED. BY MID FEBRUARY ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHED ITS NEW SYSTEM CALLED MY TURN. WITH THE GOAL OF ESTABLISHING AN ONLINE TOOL FOR CALIFORNIANS TO LEARN WHEN AND WHERE THEY CAN BE VACCINATED. GIVEN ALL THESE NEW INITIATIVES TODAY'S THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR DENTURES ADMINISTRATION. TO PROVIDE US WITH AN UPDATE ON THE OVERALL VACCINATION TIME GOES. AND IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HEAR ABOUT ALL THESE RECENT CHANGES IN HOW WHAT IMPACT OPERATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THE LAST THING ANYONE WANTS TO DO IS TO STRIP SUCCESSFUL LOCAL OPERATIONS. FOR THAT REASON I AM PLEASED THAT WE HAVE DOCTOR AMY SYSTEM OF THE YOLO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND DR PAUL SIMON FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HELP PROVIDE. A BOOST ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS ISN'T GOING TO BE HEARING ABOUT HINDSIGHT THIS HEARING IS ABOUT CLARITY GOING FORWARD. SPECIFICALLY WHAT ARE THE VACCINATION GOES MOVING FORWARD. HOW WAS RESIDENTS KNOW WHEN AND WHERE THEY CAN BE VACCINATED AND HOW CAN WE BE SURE THE VACCINES ARE BEING ADMINISTERED AND EQUITABLE MANNER TO REACH OUR MOST UNDERSTOOD UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE BEST POSITION MOVING FORWARD ALSO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MORE PARTNERSHIPS. EVERY SIX. I RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE HEARD FROM MANY IMAGE PROVIDERS AND- SERVICE PERSONNEL. THAT THEY ARE BEING UNDER UTILIZED IN BOTH TERMS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE AND ESTABLISHING AND RUNNING INCIDENT MANAGEMENT COMMAND TEAMS. AND IN THE TERMS OF BILLION FOR THE CREW TO MINISTER VACCINES. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WE NEED. TO DO MORE TO DOUBLE DOWN EFFORTS TO LIST THESE TRUSTED PARTNERS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST COVERT NINETY. AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY AND PARTICIPATION. IN WITHOUT SAID WE CAN MOVE ON TO OUR FIRST. A PANEL PANEL ONE FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AN UPDATE. AND I THINK WE HAVE DOCTOR PAUL SIMON CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER LOST JONES COUNTY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND DR AMY SAYS ON PAPER PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER YOLO COUNTY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- FOR YOUR ON THE LINE OR VIDEO YOU CAN GO FIRST. HOWEVER WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR AB SYSTEM THE HOLD OFFICER FOR YOU'LL COUNTY AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE COBRA NINETEEN VACCINE ROLLOUT IN YOLO COUNTY. AS WE DISCUSSED VACCINE OR ALLOCATION IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO MAIN STREAMS THROUGH ITS THROUGH WHICH VACCINE COME INTO YOUR COUNTY. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTLY ALLOCATES DOSES TO YOUR COUNTIES HELP DEPARTMENT AND THESE ARE DOSES THAT I AS THE HEALTH OFFICER HAVE CONTROL OVER. CDPH ALSO ALLOCATES DOSES TO LARGE HEALTH SYSTEMS CALLED MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES OR M. C. E. IS AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. EACH M. C. EAT DISTRIBUTES DOSES WITHIN ITS REGIONAL NETWORKS. THERE ARE FOUR MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES THAT SERVE YOLO COUNTY RESIDENTS DIGNITY KAISER SUTTER AND UC DAVIS HEALTH. I HAVE NO CONTROL AND ONLY LIMITED VISIBILITY OVER THE MC ITO SAYS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR YOLO COUNTY RESIDENTS. I RECEIVED TWO WEEKLY EMAILS ANNOUNCING VACCINE ALLOCATIONS ONE ON SUNDAY NIGHT FOR SECOND DOSES OF VACCINE FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND ANOTHER ON TUESDAY NIGHT FOR FIRST DOSES. AFTER RECEIVING THESE NOTIFICATIONS I MEET WITH OUR VACCINE PLANNING TEAM TO DETERMINE HOW MANY DOSES TO KEEP FOR COUNTY USE AND HOW MANY THE ALLOCATE TO PARTNERS. IN PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE WE ARE ALLOCATING 25% OF DOSES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS TO VACCINATE UNDERSERVED CLIENTS. DOSES CAPPED BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR ADMINISTERED THROUGH DRIVE THRU VACCINATION CLINICS AT SITES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY USING A SMALL TEAM OF COUNTY STAFF PAIRED WITH A LARGE CONTINGENT OF VOLUNTEERS. OUR TEAM HAS THE ABILITY TO ADMINISTER MUCH MORE VACCINE THAT WE ARE RECEIVING. RETRACTORS IS ALLOCATED TO THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT USING SPREADSHEETS AND GOOD OLD FASHIONED COUNTING OF WILES IN COLD STORAGE. DOSES ADMINISTERED BY THE COUNTY ARE ENTERED INTO A SPREADSHEET AND UPLOAD IT ON MOSS INTO THE STATE'S IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY CARE TO WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. AS OF FEBRUARY FIFTH YOU'LL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED JUST OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOSES AND ADMINISTER TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED DOSES. WE KNOW THESE NUMBERS ARE CORRECT BECAUSE WE HAVE PAPERWORK FOR EVERY DOSE ADMINISTERED. HOWEVER THE STATE IS CURRENTLY REPORTING THAT YOU'LL COUNTY HAS RECEIVED FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOSES ADMINISTERED JUST SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOSES. NEITHER THE NUMBER RECEIVED NORTHERN NUMBER ADMINISTERED BEING REPORTED BY THE STATE MATCHES WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE IN YOLO COUNTY WITH NEARLY 30% OF DOSES ADMINISTERED MISSING. YOLO COUNTY STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE STATE CONTRACTOR TO TROUBLESHOOT THE DISCREPANCIES TO NO AVAIL. I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT THE DISCREPANCIES WILL RESULT IN REDUCED FUTURE ALLOCATIONS. IF THE STATE USES ITS CURRENT DATA TO DETERMINE FUTURE ALLOCATIONS YOLO COUNTY COULD BE PENALIZED FOR WHAT THE STATE SEES AS AN ADMINISTRATION RATE OF 51% BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AN ADMINISTRATION RATE OF SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALLOCATION DECISIONS BE BASED ON ACCURATE DATA RIGHT NOW CDPH DOES NOT HAVE ACCURATE DATA FOR YOLO COUNTY. A DECISION BASED A DECISION BASED ON BAD DATA WILL BE A BAD DECISION. CALIFORNIA'S VACCINE ROLLOUT IS HAMSTRUNG BY POOR DATA QUALITY AT THE STATE LEVEL AND ITS EMPHASIS ON SPEED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT THE PRIVILEGED MORE THAN THE UNDERSERVED. WELL I DISAGREE WITH THE DECISION TO BRING IN A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WITH NO EXPERIENCE IN VACCINE ALLOCATION NOW THAT THE STATE HAS COMMITTED TO THIS CHANGE IT IS CRITICAL THAT DATA TRACKING BE IMPROVED BY ELIMINATING THE DATA UPLOAD ERRORS THAT PLAGUE THE CURRENT CARE TO SYSTEM. IN ADDITION MORE ATTENTION MUST BE PAID THE BACKSEAT EQUITY BY ENGAGING LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS WITH ON THE GROUND ALL AGE TO DIRECT- SISTER PROVIDERS THAT SERVE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND TO ALLOW APPOINTMENTS TO BE SET ASIDE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND SCHEDULED USING A SIMPLE PHONE CALL IN THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE. GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE ABOUT BOXING PRIORITIZATION HAS CHANGED MANY TIMES MAKING PLANNING DIFFICULT. CALIFORNIA AND YOLO COUNTY- CURRENTLY VACCINATING IN PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE WHICH INCLUDES THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER ALONG WITH FRONTLINE WORKERS IN THE SECTORS OF EDUCATION CHILD CARE AND URGENCY RESPONSE AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. THE LIMITED VACCINE SUPPLY MEANS THAT WE MUST PRIORITIZE WITH IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE DATA ARE CLEAR TO SAVE THE MOST LIVES WITH THE FEW DOSES WE HAVE WE MUST PRIORITIZE THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER OVER YOUNGER ESSENTIAL WORKERS. IN YOLO COUNTY WE ANALYZED MORTALITY RATES BY AGE AND FOUND THAT A VACCINE GIVEN TO A YOLO COUNTY RESIDENTS SIXTY FIVE OR OLDER IS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SAVE A LIFE THAT A VACCINE GIVEN TO OUR RESIDENTS YOUNGER THAN FIFTY. DESPITE COMPELLING DATA SUPPORTING THE NEED TO VACCINATE OUR OLDEST RESIDENTS BEFORE ESSENTIAL WORKERS STATE PRIORITISATION GUIDANCE HAS ACTUALLY MOVED IN THE OPPOSITE% DIRECTION. CDPH SHIFTER GUIDANCE ON JET SHIFT SHIFTED FROM GUIDANCE ON JANUARY THIRTEENTH TO PRIORITIZE OLDER ADULTS OVER YOUNGER ADULTS WITHIN PHASE ONE B. THE GUIDANCE ON FEBRUARY FOURTH THAT MAKES NO DISTINCTION IN PRIORITY BETWEEN OLDER ADULTS AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS WITHIN PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE. DECISIONS ABOUT VACCINE PRIORITIZATION MUST BE ROOTED IN SCIENCE AND INSULATED FROM POLITICAL PRESSURES. THE VACCINE ROLLOUT IS PROCEEDING FASTER THAN STATE DATA SUGGEST LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE PUTTING DOSES INTO ARMS AS QUICKLY AS WE RECEIVE THEM UNFORTUNATELY THE STATE DATA DO NOT REFLECT THE TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO DATE. THE SYSTEM ISN'T BROKEN IT JUST LOOKS LIKE IT IS BECAUSE DOSES BEING ADMINISTERED AREN'T SHOWING UP ONE CDPH HAS ACCURATE DATA THE DATA WILL REFLECT THE YEOMAN'S WORK BEING DONE AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO GET RESIDENTS VACCINATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT WE HAVE OUR NEXT- PERSON A PAUL SIMON OF BELIEVE HE'S ON THE PHONE VIA AT&amp;T AT&amp;T OPERATOR CAN CONNECT OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HELLO THIS IS THE A. T. AND T. OPERATOR WE DO NOT HAVE A WHOLE I'M ON OUR LINE. ABILITIES IN THE QUEUE IF YOU CAN CONNECT THEM. AT&amp;T. THREE PEOPLE IN THE QUEUE- DO YOU KNOW WHICH WHICH LINE NUMBER IS. LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE TWO ONE THREE. A PAUL SIMON IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE PLEASE PRESS STAR TO. ARE IT LOOKS LIKE I FOUND JUST ONE OF THE. IN LINE TWENTY TWO YEAR LINE UP. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS IS DOCTOR PAUL SIMON. YEAH SPEAKING AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT VIA WEBEX TODAY BUT UP. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT- I. L. A. COUNTY EXPERIENCE WITH THE CULVERT NINETEEN VACCINATION- EFFORTS. AS OF FEBRUARY FOURTH I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT L. A. COUNTY IS ADMINISTERED OVER ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOSES OF VACCINE ACROSS THE COUNTY. BUT OVER 80% OF VACCINES ADMINISTERED WITHIN FOUR DAYS OF RECEIPT. TODAY OVER 10% OF OUR COUNTY POPULATION SIXTEEN OLDER HAS RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOSE OF VACCINE. SO I WILL SAY ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT DOCTOR SYSTEM TALKED ABOUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT AT ALL OF THAT IS REFLECTED IN IN THE STATE- DATA SYSTEMS. WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE VACCINATION SITES ACROSS THE COUNTY INCLUDING SIX LARGE COMMUNITY VACCINATION SITES AND A LARGE NETWORK OF HOSPITALS. COMMUNITY CLINICS FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS PHARMACIES AND MANY PRIVATE PROVIDERS. UNFORTUNATELY THE BIGGEST ISSUE WE CONTINUE TO FACE. IS THE SCARCITY OF VACCINE SUPPLY AND VERY ABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF VACCINE WE RECEIVED FROM WEEK TO WEEK. WHILE THE SUPPLY WE RECEIVED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS HAS SLIGHTLY INCREASED. IT REMAINS FAR SHORT OF THE NEED GIVEN THAT NEARLY TWO MILLION COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE. TO RECEIVE VACCINE UNDER THE- STATE'S FRAMEWORK. AND MORE PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED WE ARE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY TO ASSESS PROGRESS IN ENSURING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE. WE ARE GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT CONDITIONS IN WHICH PEOPLE WITH FEWER RESOURCES HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THE VACCINE. EITHER BECAUSE OF LIMITED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION LET'S ABILITY TO SPEND TIME GETTING AN APPOINTMENT. AND OR LESS ABILITY TO TRAVEL TO OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTY TO GET THE BACKS THE- DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA HUMANIZATION REGISTRY WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR GAINING A BETTER pVACCINATED AND WHERE THE GAPS ARE OCCURRING. FOR EXAMPLE AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE REGISTRY DATA WE DID THIS WEEK INDICATED THAT LATINO AND BLACK RESIDENTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPRESENTED AMONG THOSE WHO HAD BEEN VACCINATED SO FAR IN OUR COUNTY. THESE EARLY RESULTS ARE EXTREMELY ALARMING AND INDICATE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS AND WORKERS TO BE VACCINATED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDERS THEY TRUST. IT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COUNTY'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT ALL DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED GROUPS ARE ABLE TO GET VACCINATED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS INCLUDES A COMMITMENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VACCINATION SITES IN HARD HIT COMMUNITIES. PENITENTIAL VACCINATION BY TOURE ADDED THIS WEEK IN EAST LA AND SOUTH LA. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO VACCINE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER AND HAVE LIMITED MOBILITY AND NEED ASSISTANCE SECURING APPOINTMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE ORGANIZING MOBILE TEAMS TO BRING VACCINATIONS NEXT WEEK DIRECTLY TO SENIORS LIVING IN SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OR ACCESSING SENIOR CENTERS THAT ARE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO HAVE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS IN THE HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES WHO ARE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO RESIDENTS ABOUT HOW TO GET VACCINATED. AND TO DISPEL MYTHS AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT THE VACCINE. AS YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS THE VACCINATION EFFORTS STATEWIDE WILL BE COORDINATED BY A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH BLUE SHIELD AND THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES- THING I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. FIRST TO ENSURE EQUITABLE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE WE URGE THE STATE TO ALLOW LOCAL JR HEALTHCARE SECTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL. PROVIDER NETWORKS TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR FQHCS ARE KEY COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN OUR COUNTY ESPECIALLY IN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND THEY NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CLIENTS. SECOND ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AND STATE REVENUE IS CRITICAL IN PROVIDING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WITH THE RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY TO IMPLEMENT. THE MERRY OUT OF ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. INCLUDING THE SWIFT AND BROAD ADMINISTRATION OF A COVER NINETEEN VACCINES. IN ADDITION TO THE STATE CENTRALIZE ROLE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER VACCINES AS WELL AS CONDUCT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMMUNICATIONS DATA TRACKING AND ANALYSIS. AND INSURING EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. THIRTY WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE I'M GOING AND TIMELY ACCESS TO DATA. ON VACCINE ALLOCATIONS AND DOSES ADMINISTERED WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS TO SUPPORT LOCAL PLANNING AND EVALUATION AND LET ME UNDERSCORE WHAT DOCTOR SYSTEMS THAT IT REALLY MUST BE ACCURATE DATA. LASTLY GIVEN THE URGENCY OF SCALING UP VACCINATIONS QUICKLY FACING LIMITED VACCINE SUPPLIES CONSISTENT AND COORDINATED MESSAGING FROM THE STATE WILL BE ESSENTIAL IN SUPPORTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN THEIR EFFORTS TO MANAGE PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS AND MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND SUPPORT FOR THE VACCINATION ROLLOUT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS LA COUNTY'S CULVER NINETEEN VACCINATION.% IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS WITH YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. DR PAUL SO AT THIS TIME WILL OPEN UP FOR DISCUSSION I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION WHEN ASKED WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT EQUITY SEEMS A BIG. ISSUE DAILY THAT THERE WERE WILL BE TALKED ABOUT HERE AND THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS THERE A WAY HOW IN OUR LOCAL LEVELS WERE MEASURING SUCCESSES PROVIDING BOXING STAR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WELL I WILL SAY AGAIN THIS REQUIRES ACCURATE DATA WE THERE'S A GREAT INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT. WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOKS LIKE HERE AND WE ARE STRUGGLING. WITH THE DATA THEY MENTION WE DID AN INITIAL ANALYSIS LOOKING AT. HOWEVER PRESENTED. OUR RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS ARE AMONG THOSE VACCINATED AND FOUND THAT CERTAIN GROUPS ARE UNDERREPRESENTED BUT- THE RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA IS NOT PARTICULARLY COMPLETE. IN THE CARE SYSTEM. AND IN ADDITION THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT ACCURACY IS AS WELL. THIS IS DOCTOR SAYS IT ALL ECHO WHAT WHAT DOCTOR PAUL L. A. COUNTY SAID- WE DID INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THOSE VACCINATED AND YOU'LL COUNTY SO FAR BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ONLY ABOUT 15% OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED ARE HISPANIC OR LATINO YET THEY REPRESENT 32% OF OUR POPULATION- BUT APPROXIMATELY A THIRD OF PEOPLE WHO'VE EXACERBATED THERE IS NO DATA. ON THEIR RACE OR ETHNICITY SO THAT THE DATA IS INCOMPLETE AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT SOME OF THE DATA. SOME OF THE DOSES THAT HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED AREN'T SHOWING UP AT ALL IN THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY WHERE WERE PULLING UP RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FROM. ON THE BACK AND SO I THINK THERE'S WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE USING TO DETERMINE. THE EQUITY OF OUR VACCINE ROLLOUT. OKAY THANK YOU SO ANY. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAD A QUESTION. A QUESTION OF VICE CHAIR KELLY HAD A QUESTION THANK YOU- FIRST OFFER EACH YEAR COUNTIES DO EACH OF YOU HAVE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY FOR YOUR COUNTY. VETERANS HOW MANY HOW MANY DOSES CAN YOU GIVE A WEEK. SO IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IDEALLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE UPWARDS OF ABOUT A HALF A MILLION. DOSES A WEEK. THAT MAY SOUND LIKE AN AWFUL LOT BUT WE HAVE TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY AND EIGHT MILLION ADULTS. AND DIFFICULT HOLLISTER VACCINATE PERIOD WE NEED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOSES A WEEK RIGHT AND WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST NETWORK OF PROVIDERS AND I THINK WE COULD BARELY VERY QUICKLY RAMP UP. TO THAT LEVEL THE VACCINATION- IF WE HAVE SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. SORRY DO YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF YOU IF YOU WERE ABLE TO GET. WE DO WE DO OKAY I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT I HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THE VALUE MY BIGGER CONCERN IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO REACH THOSE POPULATIONS THAT MAY BE HESITANT. TO BE VACCINATED OR FOR WHATEVER REASON HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING NEEDED SERVICES SO I THINK WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE. SACRIFICE VOLUME IN SOME CASES TO TRY TO REACH THOSE. ARE GROUPS THAT HISTORICALLY OF THE HAVE- NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY SERVED THAT WAS GONNA BE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR ME FROM YOLO COUNTY CAN I HEAR YOUR MAXIMUM CAPABILITY PER WEEK. YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN THOUSAND A WHICH WOULD HAVE A SAID MINISTERING ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOSES A DAY. WE CAN EASILY DO A THOUSAND DOSES A DAY AND NIGHT IN A DRIVE THROUGH CLINIC AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE. MULTIPLE OCCASIONS SO I THINK GETTING TO TEN THOUSAND IN A WEEK OUR WOULD BE WOULD BE DOABLE AND THAT BY COMPARISON WERE WE GOT TWO THOUSAND THIS WEEK SO WE COULD DO AT LEAST FIVE TIMES WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY RECEIVING. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN. ON TO THE SECOND QUESTION ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION INTO. AREAS WHERE WE ARE INTO MINORITY COMMUNITIES WHERE WE MAY NOT BE GETTING- DID THE- COOPERATION WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE. DO WE KNOW WHY- THIS IS IT ACCESS IS IT INFORMATION OR IS IT HESITANCY ON THEIR PART. BECAUSE OF. VS NOTIONS THAT- R. FX AND THEY'VE HAD WITH OUR EFFORTS TO THEY'VE HAD WITH THE VACCINES ARE THEY AFRAID TO GET IT OR THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO GET. WELL I GUESS I'LL START I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS YOU'VE MENTIONED I THINK THERE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE AFRAID BUT BUT IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT IN SOME CASES IT'S ALSO JUST A GENERAL LACK OF TRUST GIVEN. RIGHT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES OF GROUPS OR YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE OF EXPERIENCES HAVE GIVEN INDIVIDUALS IN IN OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE. THEY'RE JUST AS A GENERAL LACK OF TRUST. AND- SOME DOUBT AS TO WHETHER THE VACCINES ARE SAFE AND REALLY WORK. BUT IN ADDITION THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WE'RE SEEING CHALLENGES. AMONG SOME GROUPS AND NAVIGATING OUR SYSTEM IS. HIM TO WRAP UP VOLUME L. A. COUNTY WE'VE WE'VE OPENS- STICKS VERY LARGE POTS POINTS OF DISPENSING. AND THAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MORE VACCINE IN PEOPLE'S ARMS BUT IT HAPPENED. ADDRESSING THE EQUITY ISSUE THAT THOSE GROUPS THAT. YOU KNOW MAY MOST NEED VACCINE ARE ALWAYS WELL SERVED BY THESE LARGE POTS PARTICULARLY SENIORS. BUT ALSO- RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS I THINK. THE BEST SUCCESS WILL BE SEEN IF WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE VACCINE TO TRUSTED PROVIDERS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES CLINICS AND ALSO PHARMACY'S- AS WELL. AND YOUR. YEAH I AGREE WITH WHAT. DR PAUL HAS HAS SAID IN AN L. A. COUNTY I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS FOR WHY IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO REACH CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND SOME THAT ARE REALLY SPECIFIC TO THE FACT THAT IT'S THE OVER OR SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER POPULATION WHICH IN GENERAL TEND TO BE LESS CONNECTED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND- YOU KNOW COMPUTERS EMAIL TEXT MESSAGES OR SOCIAL MEDIA EASIEST WAY FASTEST WAY TO GET INFORMATION OUT BUT THAT IS NOT HOW WE ARE HAVING SUCCESS IN REACHING THE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER COMMUNITY SELF. SO SLOWER OUTREACH WITH MORE DOOR TO DOOR BOOTS ON THE GROUND PHONE CALLS- IS NECESSARY TO GET THAT GROUP ENGAGED- WE ALSO SEE LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND SO NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR ADVERTISING EFFORTS ARE MULTI LINGUAL ARE THERE ARE SOME MISCONCEPTIONS AND FEARS ABOUT THE VACCINE BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING WHERE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES MAY BE NERVOUS ABOUT MAKING AN APPOINTMENT IN ADVANCE AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE AND YOU'LL COUNTY IS SETTING ASIDE DOSES. OF FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT SO THAT THEY CAN WALK IN- AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO GIVE INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT IN ADVANCE SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT WERE SEEING TO OUT REACH PARTICULARLY TO THE LATINO AN OLDER ADULT COMMUNITY. GREAT THANK YOU I HAVE ONE MORE HOUR EACH QUESTION BUT I'D RATHER WAIT AND LET OTHERS ASKING QUESTIONS. AND THEN I'LL ASK LATER THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK SOME. A DARKER. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU A BOTH- DR SIMON IN THE SUN AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE DOING INCREDIBLE JOB. DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FOR YOU. HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- WHAT RESOURCES THE STRATEGIES ARE BEING EMPLOYED TO CONNECT PEOPLE WHO CAN'T ACCESS ONLINE SCHEDULING PLATFORM WITH VACCINATION APPOINTMENT. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED GOING DOOR TO DOOR PHONE CALLS BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONLINE SCHEDULING PLATFORM. YEAH ALL RIGHT OF HEAD DOCTORS THAT. STEPS THANK YOU A LOT OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WERE DOING IT IN YOLO COUNTY IS LEVERAGING OUR TWO ONE ONE A RESOURCE SO WE'VE PROVIDED THEM WITH SCRIPTS AND I PUT THE WORD OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO ONLINE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT THAT THEY CAN CALL TWO ONE ONE. AND TWO ONE ONE HAS MULTIPLE LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES AS AS WELL- SO IN ADDITION TO OUR DOOR TO DOOR OUTREACH WHERE WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO DOOR TO DOOR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TO SIGN PEOPLE UP THERE ALSO NOTIFYING PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN CALL TWO ONE ONE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU. I LIKE QUITE A LOT ANGELES COUNTY REUSING TWO ONE ONE AND WE'VE ALSO ESTABLISHED OUR OWN CALL CENTER. YOU KNOW ELIGIBILITY FOR VACCINATION WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. WHICH IS. ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN L. A. COUNTY. THE SYSTEM WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED AND- THAT'S WHY WE'VE I THINK ALSO DECIDED TO ROLL OUT A MORE- TARGETED APPROACH WERE USING A MOBILE- UNITS TO ACTUALLY GO DEEPER INTO COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO HELP REGISTER PEOPLE FOR VACCINATION WE HAVE A WHOLE CADRE OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS THAT ARE. DIRECTLY OFF WORKING WITH HIGH RISK GROUPS AND THEN I THINK AS WE TRANSITION INCREASINGLY INTO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. DELIVERING VACCINE IT WILL BE EASIER I THINK FOR PEOPLE TO GET. APPOINTMENTS HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE WITH. CAN THE- STATE DETAIL WHAT THE DATA CHALLENGES CURRENTLY ARE AND THE STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THIS INCLUDING HOW MY TURN CAN HELP CORRECT THEM. AND I'M ASKING THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATOR- I WANT TO KNOW HOW CAN WE HELP YOU. IS THAT A GOOD GOT A QUESTION FOR THE STATE BOTH SIDES IN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE LINE AS WELL WITHOUT. WITH THEIR WITH YOUR IMPORTANCE OF HOW CAN THE STATE WHAT KIND OF THE IT CHALLENGES DO YOU FIRST SEE THEM HAVING RIGHT NOW I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S MANY SYSTEMS THAT WE WERE ALL WORKING WITH AND- OBVIOUSLY SOUNDS VERY VERY COMPLICATED- BUT WE'RE JUST WONDERING HOW CAN WE HELP YOU. YOUR DOCTOR SAYS AND ALL ALL THE- TIME AND- I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW CHALLENGES- SOME HAVE TO DEAL WITH JUST A LARGE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IN THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS IN WHICH DATA ARE BEING IMPORTED AND SO- THERE AT THAT THE STATE IS CURRENTLY DEALING WITH A LOT OF ON MATCH DATA- WHERE THEY HAVE SOME INFORMATION BUT NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO LINK THOSE DOSES TO THE RIGHT PROVIDER IN THE RIGHT COUNTY SO THEY'RE SHOWING UP- AS- UNACCOUNTED FOR. BUT THERE ARE AN ON MATCHED BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME DOSES THAT WE'RE SEEING IN IN YOLO COUNTY THE 30% OF DOES IS THAT I MENTIONED ARE MISSING FROM OUR DATA. THEY'RE NOT ON MATCH THEY JUST AREN'T SHOWING UP AT ALL AND WE THINK THAT IT HAS% SOMETHING TO DO WITH- SO. THE WIN THAT DATA IS UPLOADED ON THE BACK AND INTO THE IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY THAT EVEN THOUGH WE RECEIVE A CONFIRMATION. THAT IT THE UPLOAD HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT SOMEHOW THAT DATA IS NOT SHOWING UP IN THE REGISTRY AFTER ALL. AND- IT SO I WOULD- I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHY THAT'S HAPPENING- BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR THE STATE TO WALK BECAUSE I'M- HEARING FROM MULTIPLE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IN THE GENERAL IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO REGION THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE WITH MISSING DOSES. YEAH THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT POINT WHERE WE'RE WE'RE- SEEING THE SAME THING YOU'RE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ARE CONCERNED. ON THE REGISTRATION SITE MIGHT TURN THEIR SOME FUNCTIONALITY. PETER IS THAT I THINK WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND MAYBE THE STATE IS ALREADY WORKING ON THESE BUT FOR EXAMPLE WHEN SOMEONE GOES IN. TO TRY TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT OR UNABLE TO DO SO IF THERE WAS- AND I'M A FUNCTION THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO LEAVE THEIR- NAME AND WHATEVER OTHER INFORMATION IS NECESSARY SO THAT ONE OF THE APPOINTMENT DOES BECOME AVAILABLE. THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED. AND CAN REGISTER SO IN OTHER WORDS SORT OF LIKE A WHIPPING WAITING LESS. AND IN ADDITION IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR FOLKS TO. PUT IN THE ZIP CODE. OF RESIDENTS AND THEN- BE NOTIFIED OF AVAILABLE POINT APPOINTMENTS AT ANY SITES NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE THAT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WE HEAR LOTS OF FEEDBACK FROM. OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS ON WAYS ASSISTANCE COULD BE IMPROVED. FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE SOME RUMOR PETRIE-NORRIS THE QUESTION. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU BOTH AT THINK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING- THAT THAT LOCAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT WE KIND OF GOT THE A SMALLER COUNTY AND THEN WE HAVE THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE AND YOU ALL HAVE ACTUALLY REALLY SIMILAR PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES AND AT. THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO CONFRONT I HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO- THE- ANNOUNCED THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TRANSITIONING TO A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SYSTEM AND THAT- RULING THAT OUT SHORTLY I THINK FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN VACCINATING CALIFORNIANS QUICKLY SAFELY AND EQUITABLY IS ENSURING THAT THERE'S CLARITY AROUND EVERYBODY'S ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND WHO'S DOING WHAT AND HOW THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE FIT TOGETHER. I KNOW WHEN THAT ENHANCEMENT WAS FIRST MADE THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM A LOT OF COUNTIES ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION- I'M FOR BOTH OF YOU HAVE THOSE QUESTIONS BEEN ANSWERED AND HAS THAT THAT AREA OF CONFUSION BEEN CLARIFIED OR IS THAT IS THAT STILL SOMETHING THAT- THAT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED FOR YOU. YEAH FROM MY PERSPECTIVE HERE IN IN YOLO COUNTY WE STILL HAVE. MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR BEING BROUGHT ON WILL WILL MEAN FOR US AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEVEL IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WILL RECEIVE FEWER DOSES. AND THAT OUR ROLE WILL BE TO FOCUS ON THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- BUT THAT'S REALLY KIND OF ALL WE KNOW ABOUT- WHAT THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THERE THERE REALLY IS A SHORTAGE OF. OF DETAIL FOR WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS FOR HOW THINGS WILL BE DONE DIFFERENTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNDER THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- SEVERAL REALLY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND- I BELIEVE OUR DIRECTOR AND HEALTH OFFICER. WILL VERY SHORTLY BE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STATE TO. TRY TO. ADDRESS THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS. THANKS THAT'S HELPFUL. ALL RIGHT IN NEW MANAGER COULD I HAVE ONE MORE CLASS ONE LAST QUESTION I HAD. SO I BELIEVE THE DISTRIBUTION AND HOW IT'S DONE IS BEING DECIDED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IS THAT NOT YOUR UNDERSTANDING FOR BOTH OF YOU. IT DEPENDS ON IF THEIR DOSES THAT CALM TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR DOSES THAT GO TO A MULTI COUNTY AND CITY OR LARGE HOSPITAL SYSTEM. SO IF IT'S DOSES THAT COMES OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON THE HELP OFFICER OR SOMEBODY ELSE AT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DETERMINES HOW THOSE DOSES ARGUES USE WHETHER THEY'RE CAPPED BY THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT- IT. ALLOCATED SO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR OR OTHER PROVIDERS BUT IF IT'S A DOES THAT'S ALLOCATED DIRECTLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM THAT'S DONE AT THE STATE WIDER THE REGIONAL LEVEL. AND THEN WITHIN THEIR AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS OR OUR MOTHER SHIP IF IT WORKS THEY MAKE THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WITHIN THEIR OWN SYSTEMS- AND THAT'S NOT CONNECTED TO A COUNTY LEVEL IT IN MANY CASES SO FOR EXAMPLE. KAISER DOES NOT HAVE A HOSPITAL IN YOLO COUNTY BUT THEY DO PROVIDE SERVICES TO MANY OF OUR OUR RESIDENTS BUT THEY DON'T KAISERDOESN'T HAVE A PIECE OF THE VACCINE PIE THAT GETS DIVIDED UP. FOR YOU'LL COUNTY RESIDENTS INSTEAD YOU'LL COUNTY RESIDENTS WOULD RECEIVE A VACCINE FROM KAISER OUT OF FACILITY AND EITHER SOLANO COUNTY OR SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO THE EMBASSY IS DON'T NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT DOES THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE. OF THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AT ALL OKAY. SO THE REASON I ASK THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE I WAS WONDERING IF THE COUNTIES HAVE CONSIDER THAT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVE CONSIDERED USING BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG LOGISTICS ISSUES WHAT IT IS. AND IN ORDER TO DO A DISTRIBUTION YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING ORGANIZED AND PUT HIM IN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF WORK. AND WE DO HAVE AGENCIES DISTRICTS AS CENTER OUT THERE LIKE A SCHOOL DISTRICT. THAT HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO ORGANIZE COMMUNICATE. AND DISTRIBUTE- USING PERSONNEL THERE ARE AND- THAT CAN ACTUALLY CARE OF PROBLEM ONE THING ONE OF A IS GETTING OUR- BACK TO SCHOOL. AND THE OTHER ONE IS GETTING THE TEACHER PACKAGE TEACHERS VACCINATED WHICH CAN ALSO TRANSLATE INTO FURTHER IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL. GETTING THE PARENTS OF THOSE STUDENTS VACCINATED ALSO. SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS AN OUTREACH EFFORT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PERHAPS GET THEM INVOLVED IS A POD- TO. BE ABLE TO COORDINATE AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE DIVIDED INTO CLASSROOMS THEY CAN EASILY MANAGE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EVERY SINGLE PARENT. IT TAKES CARE OF ALSO TAKES CARE OF THE ISSUE OF- ACT IT'LL PULL DISTRIBUTION- I KNOW IN OUR DISTRICT IN THE AREA THAT WE COULD HAVE EVERY TEACHER VACCINATED IN TWO DAYS USING THE R. ENDS THAT WE HAVE. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF THAT HIS BAND BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE TO ME. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE LOCAL LOW HANGING FRUIT AND THATSEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT. HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED IN A IN A POTENTIAL WHEN DID TO GET THESE VACCINATIONS OUT. AND TAKE CARE OF ANOTHER PROBLEM BESIDES JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER IS. BECAUSE ALL OF ANY OF IT HELPS. BECAUSE IT TAKES THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM OF NEED. AND AND THEY CAN DO IT A LOT QUICKER THAN WE CAN ALL MEN. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS THAT ARE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS DOCTORS NURSES. AND PROBABLY CAN ASSEMBLE A PRETTY GOOD VOLUNTEER NETWORK- TO ASSIST IN THAT AND- SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF YOU GUYS HAVE. THOUGHT OF THAT I KNOW MIGHT BE A LITTLE HARDER IN L. A. COUNTY- BUT SOME OF THE SMALLER. AIRCRAFT MIGHT. CIGRAND ACTUAL A LOT OF INTEREST IN L. A. K. AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS- LA UNIFIED UP FOR EXAMPLE IS ALREADY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AND- PARTNERING WITH SOME CITIES. IN ADDITION CITIES ARE VERY INTERESTED- AND THEY HAVE- YOU STAFF THE MERGES C. RESPOND YOURS WHO ACTUALLY CAN ADMINISTER BACKSTAGE AND THEY HAVE GREAT LOGISTICS SUPPORT. COOL DISTRICTS EAGER TO HELP OUT YEAH REALLY THE LIMITING STEP HERE GIVEN HIS VACCINE. SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET MORE VACCINES WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP THAT DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. AND THEY COULD BE LOCALIZED IN THAT WAY. AND SPEED THAT UP ABSOLUTELY. YEAH THAT'S ALL I HAVE RIGHT THANK YOU I'M HAPPY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- JUST JUST A COMMENT NOT A QUESTION- BUT JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS I THINK FROM WHAT I HEARD OF THE PANELISTS I THINK ONE IDEA THAT I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD AS MAY BE UTILIZING FQHCS- A LOT MORE THAN WE HAVE BEEN AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE- I THINK THE PRESIDENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS STARTED SAYING HEY WE'RE GOING TO SEND. VACCINES DIRECTLY TO IT FQHCS IN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY. THEY DO OFTEN HAVE A LOT BETTER CONNECTION TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND HELP AND OUT REACH ALREADY IN PLACE THAT I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL SO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD. THE THING THAT CAME OUT OF THIS- I THINK WE ALL HEARD. POOR DATA. AND SO YOU KNOW WE NEED BETTER TRANSPARENCY ON. HOW MUCH VACCINE IS ACTUALLY BEEN OUT THERE HAS IT GOT NOW- AND BETTER DATA TRUCK TRACKING. AND SO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK I HEARD- IN THIS PANEL- ONE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT SO MUCH BUT I THINK IT'S STILL A BIG ISSUE IS. THERE'S A LOT OF DISPARITY AS TO HOW THIS THING IS BEING DONE AND SO FOR INSTANCE. IT WAS MEANT IT WAS REFERENCE LITTLE BIT THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER AND FRONTLINE- WORKERS IN ONE B. WOULD BE ABLE TO BE VACCINATED TOGETHER. SOME COUNTIES ARE NOT DOING THAT YOU KNOW- SOME KIND YOU'RE SAYING NO ONLY SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. AND IT CREATES CONFUSION BECAUSE PEOPLE THEN GO TO SIGN UP AND THINK THAT THEY CAN GET VACCINATED. AND THEY CAN'T AND SO. AS MUCH AS THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT. YOU KNOW THIS CHANGE MAY WHAT WE DO REALLY NEED IS A UNIFIED- SYSTEM THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS YOU CAN SIGN UP AND YOU ARE AVAILABLE TO GET VACCINATED THAT WE DON'T HAVE DISPARITIES IN MY OWN DISTRICT. BUTTE COUNTY FOR INSTANCE IS HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF DOING BOTH. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET BOTH SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER. AND EDUCATORS AND OTHERS AND ONE BE VACCINATED. NO OTHER COUNTIES DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT BUT- IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE RIGHT. OR WHAT YOUR ZIP CODE IS. ARE CERTAINLY WHAT YOU'RE RACES RIGHT AND SO WE NEED TO. REALLY ENSURE THAT THAT'S UNIFIED AND WE'RE GETTING ALL TO. ALL THESE AREAS AND MUCH AS I THINK THERE'S BEEN GREAT JOB DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT WORKING WE DO NEED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WORK WE ARE LATINO AGAIN WE SEEM MORE LIKE CLOSE TO LAST PLACE IN GETTING THE VACCINE OUT SO. THERE DOES NEED TO BE SOME CHANGE. AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT. WITH THAT GIVE PERFECTLY TEED UP OUR SECOND PANEL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. AND THANK YOU DOCTOR SIMON AND DOCTORS TO SEND BOTH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR. I'M JUST THE REALLY HERCULEAN WORK THAT YOU AND YOUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN DOING FOR COMMUNITIES OVER. OVER THE PAST YEAR- THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WITH THAT WE'LL MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL WHICH- WILL BE AN UPDATE FIVE STATE UPDATE AND AFFECTS IN DISTRIBUTION PLANNING. WE WILL BE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MINISTRATION DR THOMAS ARAGON WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. YOUR LENDER RICHARDSON THE SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY MARTA GREEN THE PROJECT COORDINATOR AT THE STATE WIDE VACCINE NETWORK T. PA. TINA CURRY THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FROM CALLAWAY EST LORENA SERRA THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING FROM HELLO YES. MARICELA RODRIGUEZ THE DIRECTOR OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR- I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO YOU REALLY INFORMATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION. I WITH THAT I WILL GO AHEAD AND DO THAT HE HANDED OVER TO AFTER ARAGON TO BUS STARTED. WHAT GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR THE LAST ARTICLE STAPLE HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MY PRIOR TO BECOMING THE DIRECTOR OF C. PH I WORKED IN SAN FRANCISCO OVER TWENTY YEARS AND HEALTH OFFICER ROLES WAS A HEALTH OFFICER SERVICES CURRENTLY WORK FOR TEN YEARS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TO OUR PRESENT INFORMATION CALL WITH FAXING DISTRIBUTION IN CALIFORNIA. TO BRING YOU UP TO DATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY TO ADMINISTER OVER FIVE MILLION VACCINES IN THE LAST NINE WEEKS WE ARE NOW DOING IS A STATE MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE VACCINES PER WEEK GARY THE ELIGIBILITY YOU'RE CURRENTLY AWARE OF WHICH IS HEALTH CARE WORKERS LONG TERM CARE RESIDENTS INDIVIDUALS OVER SIXTY FIVE AND WORKERS IN EDUCATION AND CHILD CARE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. AND EMERGENCY SERVICES. COUNTIES MAY BE INTO PLACES ALONG THIS CONTINUUM DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION SIZE SO SOME HAVE SOME HAVE MOVED FORWARD AND ARE DOING OUT OF THISWORK SECTORS IN SUMMER STILL FOCUSING ON A SIXTY FIVE THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE ON. THE FEDERAL PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP FOR LONG TERM CARE PROGRAM WHICH IN CALIFORNIA INVOLVED CVS TO WALGREENS. HAS VACCINATED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND OF OUR ACTUALLY HAVE ADMINISTERED OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND VACCINES. IN THE STATE OF NURSING HOMES. CURRENTLY WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIX PROVIDERS WERE SIGNED UP TO PROVIDE VACCINES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE. STARTING ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH THE FEDERAL RETAIL PHARMACY PROGRAM WILL BEGIN NATION WIDE OR FORTY THOUSAND LOCATIONS INCLUDING HUNDREDS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL INVOLVE CVS AND RITE AID. AND THEY WILL BE RECEIVING- DIRECTOR ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I THANK GOD THAT ISN'T IN ADDITION TO WHAT THIS. WHAT ARE CALIFORNIA'S GETTING. HELLO PER RIGHT NOW TELL REMAINS THE AMOUNT OF VACCINE AVAILABLE THE STATE. ULTIMATELY OUR SUCCESS AND BACKS DISTRIBUTION IS DEPENDING ON RECEIVING A SUFFICIENT AND RELIABLE SUPPLY OF VACCINES FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'M GOING TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON A PRIORITIZATION VACCINE ARE PLENTY BEGAN IN APRIL OF- TWENTY TWENTY AND IT RELY PRIMARILY ON. GLOBALIZING OUR WELL ESTABLISHED EXISTING UTILIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS THAT HAD ALREADY EXISTED. THE BIG CHALLENGE THERE ARE ALWAYS REALLY THE SCALE AND SPEED OF DISTRIBUTION THAT'S REQUIRED FOR KOBE NINETEEN VACCINATION IT'S MUCH LARGER THAN ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE THEIR EXTRA CHALLENGES WITH FAXING. ESPECIALLY THE FIRST TWO THAT ARE- THAT APPROVED WHICH IS ULTRA COLD STORAGE REQUIREMENT TO USE A VACCINE IMMEDIATELY REQUIRING PERSONS TO COME BACK FOR THE SECOND DOES TWO TO THREE WEEKS LATER. THAT'S PART OF PLANNING GOVERNING USING CREATED THREE ADVISORY COMMITTEES INCLUDING THE SCIENTIFIC SAFETY REVIEW WORKGROUP. A GUIDELINE DRAFTING WORK GROUP. AND THE COMMUNITY VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THESE THREE COME OF HOW KILL SURE BACK SAFE. PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR DISTRIBUTION PRIORITIES TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OF THE PUBLIC. ON OUR ON A REGULAR BASIS WE ALSO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH THE HEALTH EXECUTIVES IN THE HEALTH OFFICERS ARE CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THEIR INPUT AS WELL. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST SHIPMENTS CAME TO CALIFORNIA ON DECEMBER FOURTEENTH AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS REALLY HISTORIC THAT WITHIN A YEAR OF A- OF A OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC OF THE SEVERITY THAT WE ACTUALLY EVEN HAVE A VACCINE- SO IT'S BOTH IT'S BOTH POSITIVE BUT THE CHIP BUT WE STILL HAVE CHECK OUR CHALLENGES AHEAD. THE FAXING PRIORITIZATION APPROACH WAS STARTED WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES ARE WHAT WE CALL A C. I. P. OUR OUR- GUYS. GROUP IN OUR COMMUNITY FAXING ADVISORY COMMITTEE WORKED WITH THIS INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. TO DEVELOP A VACCINE PRIORITIES FOR CALIFORNIA THIS IS WHAT WE NOW CALL PHASE ONE A. AND ONE B. WHICH IS OUR AND OUR- OUR COBIT. NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE. THE CURRENT ALLOCATION WORKS LIKE THIS. WE TAKE WEEKLY AMOUNTS OF VACCINE FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND DIVIDE THEM CURRENTLY TO TWO POLES. 20% OF THE VACCINES GO TO THE MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT THE KAISER'S INSIDERS THE DIGNITY. THE UC SYSTEM. AND 80% OF THE VACCINES GO TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS AS YOU HEARD FROM THE HEALTH OFFICERS. UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM ALLOCATION FORMULA. IS BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE PRIORITY GROUP IN THEIR IN THEIR COUNTY- MULTI COUNTY ENTITY. WE ARE TO BECAUSE WE TRANSITION INTO ONE BEING. THAT THE FORMULA IS NOW MORE POPULATION BASED AS OPPOSED TO. INITIALLY. WHICH WAS PRIMARILY HEALTH CARE BASED. ONE THING WE RELY THAT ALL OF THIS WOULD HAPPEN AT THE VERY TIME VERY SAME TIME THAT WE HAVE THIS TREMENDOUS SURGE. THE SURGE REALLY FOCUS NOT FORCES TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW. WE CAN IMPROVE OUR RACKS AND VACCINATION APPROACH REALLY FOCUSING ON SAVING LIVES TO ACHIEVING EQUITY. AND REALLY THERE IS THREE THREE KEY WORDS ARE REALLY SORT OF CAME OUT OF AND THAT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON SPEED SIMPLICITY AND SCALE. BOB BECAUSE HE REALIZES THAT WEEK IN ORDER FOR IN ORDER FOR US TO IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER. BUT AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM ARE PEOPLE WHO-CAME FROM FROM DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES PRIMARILY LATINO. AND AFRICAN AMERICAN. SO FOR ME AS A CDPH DIRECTOR PART OF MY ROLE IS TO REALLY SORT OF FOCUS ON HEALTH EQUITY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS OF THE SURGEON GENERAL CALIFORNIA TO DEVELOP EQUITY METRICS AND ALLOCATION PRINCIPLES ENSURE VACCINE IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE MOST IMPACTED AREA. ACCORDING WITH THE AIM OF THIS AS LAUNCHING A VACCINATION A PILOT SITES IN OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES THERE WILL ALSO BE. ALSO BE WORKING TO SET OF SIGHTS AND OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY HIGHLY IMPACTED. I WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED AND AGAIN JUST TO GO BACK TO THE IDEA HERE IS SPEED SIMPLICITY AND SCALE. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A LOT OF ISSUES AROUND THE DATA WE HAVE TO IMPROVE THE DATA. WE WANT TO WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE VERY ABILITY THAT'S AND THAT'S UNNECESSARY. AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO SUPPORT. NEED TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEMS THE PHARMACY SYSTEMS ARE CLINICS OR SOMETHING AND ALL OF US NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO WORK ON OUR STRENGTH. TO DO WHAT WE'RE BEST AT TO DO WHAT WE'RE BEST AT DOING AND THAT'S REALLY WHY THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WAS BROUGHT ON BOARD. THE SCALE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. WE NEED EVERY HAND ON DECK WE NEED EVERY WE NEED IT EVERYBODY EVERYBODY THE HOUSE THE CORE COMPETENCIES THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LARGE SCALE- VACCINATION PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL. IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS OUR COUNTIES AND OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PITTING WERE- COMMITTEE TO THIS APPROACH. I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER NOW TO SECONDARY ALONG THE RICHARDSON WHO'S GONNA BEGIN TO PRESENT YOU BY THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. AND THE GOALS OF THE PARTNERSHIP I WILL BE AVAILABLE HERE FOR QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE TRICIA BLOCKER. WHO'S R. C. PH ARE- PROGRAM READY FOR VACCINATIONS AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS LATER. BOB BAKKEN TRIP OVER TO SECRETARY. RICHARDSON THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR DON APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INTENSIVE WORK UNDER WAY TO BUILD THE STATEWIDE VACCINE DELIVERY NETWORK. AS YOU MAY KNOW IN EARLY JANUARY GOVERNOR NEWSOM ASKED ME TO BRING OPERATIONS THINKING TO THE JOB OF DELIVERING THE CULVERT NINETEEN VACCINE IN CALIFORNIA AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCELERATING THE DELIVERY OF VACCINE ENSURING EQUITABLE ADMINISTRATION AT THE EXACT SAME STATEWIDE. AS YOU'VE HEARD US SAY WE WANT TO ENSURE. THERE IS TO BE NO BARRIERS TO THE EQUITABLE AND SPEEDY DELIVERY OF VACCINATIONS EXCEPT THE PACE WITH WHICH VACCINE SUPPLIES I'M TO THE STATE. MY INVOLVEMENT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS AND COUNTIES HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS WORK TO PLAN FOR VACCINE DELIVERY IN EACH OF THE STATE'S LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK FOR DR ERICA PAN AM AND DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS DID IN COLLECTING INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE EXPERT WORK I PUBLIC HEALTH BURKE EXPERTS FROM THE STATE'S SCIENTIFIC SAFETY ENTRAPPING GUIDELINES WORKGROUPS. THIS IS THE WORK THAT WILL SERVE AS THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM. NOW COMES THE HOUSE HOW DO WE ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF VACCINE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. TO ACHIEVE TRANSPARENCY EQUITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AFTER SIX AFTER ASSESSING OUR INITIAL APPROACH WE IDENTIFIED A NEED TO SCALE UP QUICKLY AND DETERMINED THAT USING A TRUSTED HEALTH PLAN PARTNER WOULD BE THE BEST APPROACH. SO THAT WE COULD VACCINATE THE STATE AT THE PACE WE NEED WHILE ALSO ENSURING WE HAVE THE DATA WE NEED TO MAKE A STRATEGIC DECISIONS TO ALLOCATE TAXING FOR OPTIMAL RESULTS. YOU MAY HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT RECENTLY THE STATE HAS ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA. TO CREATE A SINGLE STATEWIDE NETWORK. SERVING AS THE STATE'S THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. GOING FORWARD USING A SINGLE STATEWIDE NETWORK GIVES US THE INSIGHTS WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE AN EYE ON EQUITY NOT JUST A COUNTY BY COUNTY LOOK. AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES MOST AFFECTED BY COVERT NINETY. DEATH AND ILLNESS WHERE VACCINE IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. AT THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST WORKING WITH OFFICIALS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. WE ASSESS WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING CERTAINLY THE LACK OF SUPPLY. IS WHAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN FOCUSED ON IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE SEE NOW. BUT IN RECENT WEEKS I'M SORRY IF IN RECENT WEEKS IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS TAKING TOO LONG TO GET THE VACCINES ADMINISTERED. AND A SYSTEM IN PLACE FAVORED INDIVIDUALS WITH TIME AND RESOURCES. TO NAVIGATE COMPLEX PORTALS AND LIMITED APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY. ADDED FAVOR THOSE WITH TIME AND RESOURCES TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO GET BACKSTAGE. FOR THIS REASON THE STATE CHAU ANY TOM WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS LOS ANGELES COUNTY BROUGHT UP THE MY TURN TOOL FOR STATEWIDE USE. MY TURN HAS THREE COMPONENTS HELPING THE PUBLIC LEARNED WHEN IT IS THEIR TIME AND TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS HELPING VACCINATORS SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS AND MANAGE THEM ON THE BACK IN AND HELPING VACCINATORS STATEWIDE REPORT THEIR DATA ON VACCINE DOSES ADMINISTERED. THE FRONT END PORTAL ANSWERS THE QUESTION ON THE MINDS OF SO MANY CALIFORNIANS WHEN WILL IT BE MY TURN TO GET THE VACCINE. TODAY MY TURN ENABLES ANYONE TO REGISTER FOR NOTIFICATION TO LEARN WHEN IS THERE TIME. THIS WILL BE THE PRIMARY PLACE CALIFORNIANS CAN GO TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS. TO GET VACCINATED IN THE COMING MONTHS. ARE MY CURRENT OR MY TURN DOT CA DOT GOV SYSTEM SHOWS THE FOCUS WE PLACE. ON MAKING OUR TOOLS ACCESSIBLE TO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE. MY TURN IS AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AND ADDITIONAL AN ADDITIONAL SIX LANGUAGES BY MALE MID FEBRUARY. IT IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY A TOLL FREE NUMBER FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WITH OPERATORS WHO SPEAK ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WITH THE ABILITY TO ADD A THIRD PARTY TRANSLATOR FOR ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR LANGUAGES. AS OF MONDAY ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR NOTIFICATIONS TO KNOW WHEN IT'S THEIR TURN. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND VACCINE APPOINTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE VIA MY TURN MOSTLY IN LA AND SAN DIEGO WHERE WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT WITH THE TOOL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AS YOU HAVE HEARD YES TREMENDOUS WORK BEING DONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO VACCINATE CALIFORNIANS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND I KNOW THE PASSION THESE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS HAVE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. STILL ARE EARLY METRICS SUGGEST THE VACCINE IS NOT REACHING THE COMMUNITIES MOST AFFECTED BY THE DISEASE. AND WE MUST DO BETTER. IF EVER EQUITY IN THIS MATTER IN THE STATE IT SHOULD MATTER AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF A SHOT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. AS WE SHIFT TO USING BLUESHIELD AS A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TO ADMINISTER VACCINES STATE WIDE. EQUITY IS OUR NORTH STAR AND IT WILL BE BAKED INTO EVERYTHING FROM THE CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT TO THE SELECTION OF VACCINE PROVIDERS. WILL USE IT TO BUILD STATEWIDE PROVIDER NETWORK THAT DOESN'T LEAVE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC BEHIND. AND WILL USE MY TURN. TO ENSURE APPOINTMENTS ARE ALLOCATED EQUITABLY SO MASS VACCINATION CLINICS DON'T ONLY SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE TIME. AND THE RESOURCES AND OUR ONLINE STAFFING. USING BLUESHIELD TO HELP US BUILD STATE VACCINE. NETWORK IS ALSO ABOUT SCALE. AT THE END OF JANUARY WE DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION DOLLARS DOES THIS FOR WEEKS THAT WILL NOT GET AS CLOSE TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. WE ARE BUILDING CAPACITY FOR THE STATE TO DELIVER FOUR MILLIONS D'EUROS DOSES PER WEEK WHICH IS FOUR TIMES WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. THAT WILL HELP US GET TO A COMMUNITY IMMUNITY FASTER AND IT WILL ADVANCE HE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINES STATE WIDE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES. WHO HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK AS PARTNERS IN THE STATE NETWORK OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. WILL CONTINUE. TO RECEIVE VACCINE SUPPLY TO ASSIST WITH HELPING HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES GET VACCINATED. ROSS THE STATE HOWEVER THERE WILL BE A FASTER DISTRIBUTION PROCESS WITH STANDARDIZED REPORTING TO THE STATE TO OPTIMIZE THE ALLOCATION OF VACCINES. AND ACHIEVE THE TRANSPARENCY EQUITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED. DR GALLEON I WILL PARTNER ON ENSURING THAT VACCINES ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A FOCUS ON TRANSPARENCY AND EQUITY AND WE WILL BE MAKING THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION DATA AVAILABLE ON THE COBIT NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV WEBSITE. OVER THE NEXT MONTH BLUESHIELD WILL BE PARTNERING WITH OUR COUNTY HEALTH PROVIDERS TO BUILD THE STATE WIDE NETWORK. PROVIDERS WHO WISH TO BECOME PART OF THE NETWORK WILL BE CONSIDERED BASED ON CRITERIA THAT ENSURE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACCELERATE VACCINES ACROSS THE STATE. IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE EQUITABLE AND EFFICIENT. PROVIDERS WILL ALSO COMMIT TO USING THE SYSTEMS AND DATA REPORTING NEEDED TO TRACK PERFORMANCE. ALL PROVIDERS IN THE STATE MY BACKS THE NETWORK WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE MY TALENTS TO ENSURE THE STATE HAS WHAT WE NEED TO ENSURE WE ARE MEETING OUR GOALS. UNDER THE STATEWIDE NETWORK WE WILL OFFER INCENTIVES TO PROVIDERS FOR MEETING EQUITY SAFETY HALL YOU AND EFFECTIVENESS TARGETS. START UP COSTS TO GET PROVIDERS ON THE NETWORK WHO WILL HELP US MEET EQUITY GOALS. AND FUNDING FOR DISTRIBUTION SITES MOBILE CLINICS AND FUNDING TO SUPPORT IN HOME VACCINATIONS FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT TRAVEL TO VACCINES SITES. I'M CONFIDENT THAT OUR STATE WIDE NETWORK IN THE RESOURCES BEING DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING VACCINATION AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. GIVES US THE BEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING A CRITICAL GOAL OF ENSURING OUR PROGRAM IS A VACCINATION PROGRAM FOR ALL NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE WELL RESOURCE AND TIME RESOURCE TO CHASE DOWN VACCINATION. AT EVERY STEP WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS. I KNOW THAT THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS COMING ON VERY QUICKLY. BUT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL OPERATE WITH TRANSPARENCY AND WE WILL SHARE DATA IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. AS THIS NETWORK IS BUILT OUT COMPLETELY AND ADDITIONAL VACCINE SUPPLY ARRIVES. AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO MARK GREEN OUR PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH BLUE SHIELD BLUESHIELD TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PARTNERSHIP. AT I THINK THAT. OR MAYBE EVEN YOUR. I THINK YOUR MIKE YOUR MIKE IS ON MUTE. MY APOLOGIES FOR HAVING A LITTLE BIT OF A CAMERA CHALLENGE HERE. THANK YOU SECRETARY RICHARDSON MEMBERS OF THE OMMITTEE I'M MARTHA GRAHAM THE PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR THE STATE BY TAKING PROGRAM. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY TO EXPLAIN WHAT A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IS AND HOW YOU INTEND TO WORK WITH BLUE SHIELD TO HELP ADVANCE THE EQUITABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF CONNECTING VACCINATION STATE. I WOULD HAVE TO BE A PART OF THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT BECAUSE MY PERMANENT CAPACITY. I OVERSEE THE TPO THAT ADMINISTERS CALPERS SELF FUNDED HEALTH PLANS AS WELL AS ALL OF ITS INSURED HEALTH PLANS ON BEHALF OF STATE. LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCY AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. ADDITIONALLY PRIOR TO CALPERS HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF THE HEALTH PLAN REGULATOR WHICH GIVES YOU UNIQUE INSIGHT. HOW TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT. BUT THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS SIMPLY SERVES. AS AN ADMNISTRATIVE OR COORDINATING ENTITY FOR THE DELIVERY OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA IS A STATE WIDE NOT FOR PROFIT HEALTH PLAN. AT THE STATE WIDE REACH WE NEED TO HELP US WITH THE MASSIVE COORDINATION INVOLVED. IN THE EQUITABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF VACCINES TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AT THE FACT THE- SUPPLY ROUTES. BASED ON OUR GUIDELINES BLUESHIELD WILL SELECT PROVIDER STRATEGICALLY THE MY TERM APPOINTMENT TOOL. FOR TERRY SAID WE MEAN BUSINESS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY. ACTIVE WILL BE ALLOCATED TO COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN PERFORMANCE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE TO PROVIDERS WHO WORK WITH TO VACCINATE INDIVIDUALS THE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. START UP COSTS WE MADE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS LOCATED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO GET ON THE STATEWIDE NETWORK AND MOBILE VACCINATION SITES WE DEPLOYED TO COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BRICK AND MORTAR. VACCINATION SITES TO ENSURE WE REACH ALL CALIFORNIANS. THERE WILL ALSO BE HOME BASED VACCINATIONS FOR PEOPLE UNABLE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES DUE TO THEIR DISABILITIES. THE STATE WOULD PROGRAM A LARGE WITH ITS FIRST MAJOR PROVIDERS INCLUDING PRESENCE. WITH THE COUNTY BY COUNTY ON BOARD APPROACH THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AS THE SECRETARY SAID BLUESHIELD AND STATE LEADERSHIP WILL MEET WITH EACH FUNDING PARTNER TO ENSURE THE MOST CRITICAL PROVIDERS TO HELP US MEET OUR EQUITY TARGETED EACH COMMUNITY. OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE NETWORK. I AM CONFIDENT THAT OUR STATEWIDE NETWORK AND RESOURCES BEING DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING TAXATION UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE OF ACHIEVING A CRITICAL GOAL OF ENSURING OUR PROGRAM IS A VACCINATION PROGRAM FOR ALL. NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE WELL RESOURCE AND TIME RESOURCE TO CHASE DOWN TACTIC. AT EVERY STEP WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS AND BEING TRANSPARENT IN ALL WE DO.

EACH MOBILE UNI WILL HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOSES ADMINISTERED PER DAY. WE ARE COORDINATING BE FAXING EFFORTS WITH ALL THE OTHER EFFORTS. CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY I SECRETARY RICHARDS ANDTHAT ARE BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE YEAH. THE NEXT SPEAKER MY CELL RODRIGUEZ WILL THINK MORE ABOUT HOW WE HOPE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER GROUPS TO HELP US SERVER CALIFORNIA'S MOST HARD HIT COMMUNITIES. BUT I'M SURE THAT ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO AND GET FASCINATED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME OKAY. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU TO OUR CHAIRED AN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE STATE'S PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN- AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS- SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR BUT A PART OF MY ROLE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITH TO HELP OVERSEE THAT ABSENCES CAMPAIGN ARE TWENTY TWENTY SENSES EFFORTS AND WE'RE TAKING A LOT OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED. AND APPLYING THEM NOW TURKOMAN NINETEEN RESPOND AND ACTING EDUCATION EFFORT. THE GOAL OF THE RECTORY OFFICE CAMPAIGN IS TO HELP EDUCATE MOTIVATE AND ACTIVATE. CALIFORNIANS TO GET VACCINATED WHEN IT'S THEIR TURN. THE KEY MESSAGING TOPICS FOR THE CAMPAIGN INCLUDES. PROVIDING BASIC OF ACTING FACT. ADDRESSING BARRIERS LIKE HESITANCY AND AXES. HELPING CALIFORNIA'S NAVIGATE ACTING OUT ABILITY AND PROCESS. WHAT EQUITY AND THEIR CORE FOCUS THE CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON REACHING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CO THE NINETEEN. THROUGH THREE KEY STRATEGIES. FIRST THE TAKING ON A DATA DRIVEN APPROACH. SECOND IS LEADING COMMUNICATION EFFORTS WITH CULTURAL HUMILITY AND THREE IS DRIVING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THROUGH TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AS I MENTIONED OUR FIRST STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE DATA TO INFORM OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE WE ARE REACHING CALIFORNIANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY THE PANDEMIC AND THIS INCLUDES LEVERAGING THE HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND COVERED POSITIVITY RATE. IN ADDITION WE WILL BE MONITORING THIS AND DISINFORMATION AND DIFFICULT- RUMORS IN IDENTIFYING INTENTIONAL ACT TO MISLEAD PEOPLE USING. SOCIAL LISTENING TOOLS. WE WILL ALSO COLLECT INPUT FROM OUR COMMUNITY GROUPS ON THE GROUND- MAYBE- IDENTIFYING AND EXPERIENCING THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY ON THE GROUND. LASTLY THE CAMPAIGN IS ROOTED IN BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH PROTECTING MESSAGES AND CREATIVE ACCESS WITH OUR TARGET COMMUNITIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH MESSAGES WILL RESONATE MOST. ENTERED INTO BY BARRIERS AND MOTIVATORS TO HELP ACTIVATE CALIFORNIANS TO UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS BACK THE APPLICATION. THE SECOND OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO ALWAYS COMMUNICATE WITH CULTURAL HUMILITY. THIS INCLUDES DEVELOPING MESSAGES AND MATERIALS NOT ONLY INFORMED BY THE COMMUNITY RESEARCH I JUST MENTIONED. AND IN MORE THAN A DOZEN LANGUAGES BUT ALSO LEVERAGES TRUSTED MESSENGERS AS WE KNOW FROM OUR OUR OTHER CAMPAIGNS THE MESSAGE IS CRITICAL AND EVEN MORE SO WHO DELIVERS THAT. SIX STRATEGY LEANS IN ON TRUSTED MESSENGERS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRULY IN FRONT THE TRADITIONALLY HARD TO REACH POPULATIONS. THIS IS ALSO WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IN OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS TO BE CLOSELY COORDINATED. THE CAMPAIGN ALSO RELIES HEAVILY ON ETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL MEDIA WHICH HAS IN MANY CASES A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF TRUST THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AMONG THOSE WHO SEEK TO REACH. ETHNIC MEDIA OUTLETS ARE OPEN OVER ADVOCATING FOR THEIR AUDIENCES AND ISSUES OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. AS AN EXAMPLE CURRENT EFFORTS REPORTING ETHNIC MEDIA BRIEFING. ENGAGING TRUCKED MESSENGERS. REPORTING LIVE FRIEDMAN RADIANT YOUR FORTY ETHNIC MEDIA OUTLETS AND COVERING EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. AB AND INVESTING IN PAID MEDIA EFFORTS INCLUDING SPANISH TELEVISION. THE THIRD ASPECT OF OUR STRATEGY IS A TESTAMENT TO LEVERAGE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FOR TRUSTED MESSENGERS. WE ARE PRIORITIZING QUALITY AND ENGAGEMENT. ON INFORMATION ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIANS CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITY FROM COVER NINETEEN. PROVIDING REFERRALS TO THINKING THAT SERVICES INFORMATIONAL WORKERS RIGHT AND THE COMPANY CAME BACK CLEAN. THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED FOR SB ONE ONE FIVE AT THE STATE IS INVESTING THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTREACH PROJECT. ITS INVESTMENT SUPPORT THE HUNDRED FIFTY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LEVERAGING THE HISTORY AND ESTABLISHED NETWORKS THEY HAVE WITH HARPER TO REACH POPULATIONS. TO HELP US MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. HELP THAT RICH PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON TOP PRIORITY POPULATIONS INCLUDING ASIAN AMERICAN BLACK AFRICAN. AMERICAN INDIAN NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL LATINO MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS LGBT Q. FIVE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OLDER ADULT WOMEN IN ENGLISH PROFICIENT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND PEOPLE LIVING IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS. WHAT THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROJECT OR STATEWIDE THE COMPANY TO WORKPLACE SAFETY EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED FOR HIGHER RISK INDUSTRIES ARE LOCATED. THESE INCLUDE AGRICULTURE FOOD PROCESSING SERVICE JANITORIAL WAREHOUSING LOGISTICS AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY. TODAY AT SEVENTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN AWARDED TWO HUNDRED TEN CEOS MORE EXPECTED BY THE END OF FEBRUARY. THIS VIDEO NETWORK IS BEING MANAGED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CENTER OF THE YEAR HEALTH FOUNDATION. AND AMERICA CALGARY COMMITTEE FOUNDATION. WE WANT TO BE WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH OUR SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS ARE UNIQUELY EQUIPPED TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. THE STATE IS ALSO CASACORNELIA WITH THE TOGETHER TOWARDS HEALTH EDUCATION CAMPAIGN A PROJECT SUPPORTED BY PHILANTHROPY TO FUND ADDITIONAL CBO TO MAXIMIZE THE REACH AND IMPACT. AND SIMILAR TO OUR TWENTY TWENTY PRESENT EFFORTS WE WANT TO LEVERAGE OUR STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS AND WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP EACH CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THIS CRITICAL WORK. THANK YOU AN ALTERNATE CALL HIM TURN IT BACK. TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THANK YOU TO TWO OF OUR PRESENTERS FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THAT WILL MOVE TO NUMBER QUESTIONS. CARE RODRIGUEZ DURING THE START OR- YES SEVERAL QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST. GET TO ABOUT THE WAY US SECRETARY RICHARDSON I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE PRESENTATION ONE THING THAT STRUCK MY MIND RIGHT AWAY WAS YOU SAID EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO A PLACE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE FOUR MILLION BUCKS IN THE WEEK- DO WE HAVE A TIME FRAME WHEN THAT WILL OCCUR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW WE ARE WORKING ON PROJECTIONS TO SEE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE I THINK YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT TODAY. ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT CAPACITY IS STILL AS WE TRANSITION TO THE CPA THAT WILL BE THEIR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS TO FIGURE OUT WHATKIND OF CAPACITY IS SO WE CAN SEE WHERE THE GAPS ARE SO WE CAN WORK ON THE GAPS. OKAY JUST ONE MORE. QUICK QUESTION. OF SOMEBODY ELSE. OF BEING THAT OUR PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS OR- IN THE BUSINESS OF MAKING THE VACCINE TO. AND MEDICATIONS OUT. AND WHATNOT. HAVE WE'VE CONSULTED WITH THEM TO LEARN ABOUT. ANY EXISTING DISTRIBUTION PROCESS AND THEY HAVE SINCE THEY'VE- COME IN THAT REALM ALREADY SO JUST KIND OF CHRISTOPHER. REEVE REACHED OUT TO EVERY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES ABOUT WHAT THEY DO TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINES OR MEDICATIONS. ANOTHER WOULD HELP US IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH WE HAVE BEEN TALKING DIRECTLY WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT DIRECTLY WITH THE MANUFACTURERS ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION PROCESS. BUT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION HOW THEY HAVE BEEN IN TALKS WITH THE MANUFACTURERS TO REALLY TRY TO EXPEDITE GETTING MORE VACCINE- TO THE STATE'S. MEDINA THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF THE CHAIRS OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR- BRINGING US TOGETHER FOR THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT- HEARING. I WANT TO STATE THE OBVIOUS WHEN I SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OR TO THIS LEGISLATURE. THAN THE SUCCESSFUL. EXECUTION OF THE VACCINE A ROLLOUT. AS I HEARD SPEAKERS SAY IT IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH- AND I. WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CHALLENGES THAT IT HAS BEEN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR ALL THE PRESENTERS RIGHT HERE THIS AFTERNOON- BUT I WANT TO SHARE. A CALL THAT I HAD THIS AFTERNOON ON MY WAY OVER HERE. I REPRESENT- THE CITIES OF RIVERSIDE MORENO VALLEY AND PERRIS AND ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. EIGHTY SIX YEAR OLD COLLEGE EDUCATED- MAN- CALLED ME. HE IS MORE TECHNICALLY SAVVY AND COMPUTER LITERATE THAN I AM. BUT HE'S EIGHTY SIX YEARS OLD. AND HE SHARED WITH ME THAT SINCE THE VACCINE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. IN RIVERSIDE. HE'S AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE THEY HAVE LOTS OF TIME ON ON THEIR HANDS AND HE'S BEEN SPENDING HIS TIME TRYING TO GET AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE VACCINE. AND HE'S EIGHTY SIX YEARS OLD. ADD UP TO THIS AFTERNOON HE WAS UNABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT OR EVEN TO KNOW ACTUALLY WHERE TO GO. HE WAS OF AT A LOSS AT A LOSS LIKE MOST. ESPECIALLY ELDERLY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN. AT A LOSS OF KNOWING WHAT TO DO WHERE TO GO HELLO WHAT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH THAT SAID. I WILL HAVE TO AGREE I REQUEST MY COLLEAGUES- FROM CHICO THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW IS NOT WORKING. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN SO FAR- IT IN THIS ROLLOUT HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF CHAOTIC. IN AT THE BOTH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEETING YESTERDAY AND THE RIVERSIDE CITY COUNCIL. THERE WAS- FRUSTRATION EXPRESSED THE BOTH OF THOSE MEETINGS RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- POINTED TO THE NUMBERS THE NUMBER VACCINES PER POPULATION IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY HAD THE LOWEST PER THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND- IN RIVERSIDE. FOREIGN I HEARD DR I DON'T SAY THAT THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT AT FIRST THE ROLLOUT WAS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS. IN THE COUNTY AND IF YOU KNOW I CAN ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THAT MAY VERY WELL BE BUT THOSE DISPARITIES DO NOT SIT VERY WELL WITH THE COUNTY WITH THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- OR OR THE CITY'S- HOW HOW DO WE HOW TO AND HERE'S MY QUESTION HOW HOW CAN WE BE ASSURED THAT RIVERSIDE COUNTY WILL NOT BE LEFT BEHIND DID RIVERSIDE COUNTY WILL GET ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE- DOSES OF THE VACCINE. IF SOMEONE COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION FORM. THE DOCTOR ARE GOING I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO AHEAD AND START AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS- AND WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THIS IS WHY THE DATA ISSUES ARE VERY IMPORTANT EARLY ON YOU HEARD THE HEALTH OFFICERS- AT FROM BOTH- YOU'LL COUNTY LOS ANGELES DESCRIBED THE CHALLENGES WE'RE HAVING WITH DATA. AND SO OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY INTENSE FOCUS FOR US. CLEANING UP THE DATA. GET IMPROVING THE PROVING THE QUALITY MAKING SURE THAT EVERY DOES GETS ADMINISTERED. BECAUSE WITHOUT GOOD DATA WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE VISIBILITY ON THE CHEAP IN ANY OF OUR GOALS- AND AS YOU HEARD FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE AN ANALYSIS OF THEIR DATA AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE OUT OF REACH THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. HAS NOT BEEN WHERE WHERE WE WANTED AND THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE TRUE ACROSS COUNTIES. SO THE DATA IS GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S AN EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION. ACROSS THE STATE- I'M GONNA I WILL ALSO LEAVE IT IF ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO ADD MORE TO THE. NOT HEARING. ANYONE SPEAKING UP. I WAS GONNA SAY I WAS GOING TO SPEAK UP AND SAY TO TALK ARTICLE IT'S POINT. IS WHY. IN THE STATEWIDE NETWORK WE'RE REALLY EMPHASIZING THE USE OF MY TURN I THINK THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE. OF MAKING SURE THAT IN THAT SCHOOL WE WILL BE ABLE TO ALLOCATE. APPOINTMENTS TO THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN GET IN TO SEE SEEN. ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A CALL CENTER THAT HAS THAT SAME CAPACITY AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN REACH PEOPLE IN THE LANGUAGES THAT ARE- MOST COMFORTABLE FOR THEM. I THINK WILL HELP US TO MAKE SURE NOT ONLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. BUT WE'RE REACHING ALL OF OUR TARGETED POPULATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS FAR AS MY TURN OF THE PLATFORM- THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE YET CORRECT ACROSS THE STATE. THAT'S CORRECT RIGHT NOW IT'S STILL BEING PILOTED IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM BUT IT WILL BE AVAILABLE YOU'LL BE ROLLED OUT AFTER THE FIFTEENTH OF THIS MONTH. WELL YOU LANDA AND DEAD THAT'S CORRECT IN TERMS OF THE THAT BACK IN FOR THE CLINICAL DELIVERING CLINICAL SERVICES BUT YOU CAN GO RIGHT NOW WE JUST REGISTER YOUR NAME AND INFORMATION. BUT THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC ONE IS AVAILABLE. AT AND YOU'LL BE CONTACTED FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND YOU CAN TELL WHEN YOUR- RETURN IS. NOT NOT YET. OKAY BUT YOU CAN REGISTER YOU COULD YOU COULD YOU CAN SHE SHE BROUGHT UP THE STATISTICS EARLIER ABOUT- I THINK I BELIEVE YOU SAID YOU WANTED IT'S MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE READY TO RIP JUST REGISTERED. THAT IS CORRECT SO WHAT POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE GONE ON TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A NOTIFICATION THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT AN APPOINTMENT ABSOLUTELY THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE STATE. I'M SURE I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I WILL STOP AND BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THIS- LEGISLATORS CONCERNED YOU'RE- ASKING US TO HAVE MORE FAITH- IN IN. YOU'RE GOING TO DO GOING FORWARD. THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST THAT THANK YOU. LET ME JUST ASK A COUPLE OF QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AROUND MY TURN SO- YOU'VE EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF MY TURN BOTH A THINK IS A FRONTEND INTERFACE FOR CONSTITUENTS AND- BACK IN FOR DATA MANAGEMENT. CAN YOU GIVE US SOME MORE SPECIFIC MILESTONES FOR THE STATEWIDE LAUNCH AND ROLLOUT OF THE MY CURRENT SYSTEM. HI EVERYONE- THIS IS INCOME AND THAT THE STATE'S CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER I'M ACTUALLY- LOGGING IN FROM YOUR LOT THAT SECRETARY RICHARD RICHARDSON CAMERAS SO YOU SEE HER NAME BUT I'M HERE TO- CHIME IN THE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE QUESTION OF MY TURN- YES THERE ARE- I ALSO THOUGHT WE MARCHING TOWARDS TO. GET AS MANY COUNTY AS POSSIBLE IF NOT ALL OF THEM BY MARCH I'M SORRY FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. AND GETTING THEM ONBOARD IS ONE THING IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT THE COUNTIES ARE STILL STARTING TO PUT THEIR SCHEDULE INVENT A VACCINATION SITES ONTO THE MY TURN SYSTEM. SO THAT WHEN THE RESIDENT UP THAT COUNTY. OF ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR TURN BIG COULD TURN AROUND AND SCHEDULE THOSE APPOINTMENTS USING MY TURNED. IN SO FAR- THERE ARE ONLY SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES ARE PUTTING THEIR SCHEDULE ON MY TURN AND THIS IS THE PROCESS WE'RE GOING THROUGH I'M FOR REST OF THE COUNTY. ON TO THE METRIC SYSTEM. GREAT THANK YOU WHAT IS WHAT'S THE SCALE FOR THAT. AB CAN YOU GIVE US THAT CAN YOU GIVE US THAT SCHEDULE AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS HEARING. YES WE CAN SEND THE- SCHEDULE BUT THE TOP LINE. DO THEY THAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR IS TO GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD AGUIAR-CURRY FIFTEEN HOWEVER WE DO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE COUNTY FUTURE FINISH THEIR CURRENT SCHEDULE EMAIL WILL GO BEYOND THAT SO WE ARE. WORKING WITH COUNTY ONE BY ONE FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST TIME TO TRANSITION THEIR NEW SCHEDULES INTO MY CAR FOR THE ONBOARDING SHOULD FINISH BY FEBRUARY. OKAY SO THE GOAL IS TO HAVE ALL COUNTIES ONBOARDED. ON TOP MY TURN BY FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. THAT'S OUR GOAL I KNOW THERE ARE COUNTIES ARE. WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS BUT THAT IT'S OUR INTENTION TO GET THE CHILD HE'S ON BOARD IT AND THEN AND THEN- ACTUALLY AFTER THAT HAVE ALL OF THEIR SCHEDULES TO BE ON MY TRUCK. OKAY GREAT IN IN AYE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT JUST FIVE DOCTOR ARE GONE TO CLARIFY THAT YOU FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT MIGHT TURN SYSTEM IS NOT LIVE STATEWIDE IT'S KIND OF LIVE FOR LIKE A PRE REGISTRATION- IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY. WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY CONNECTED WITH COUNTY DATA AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE TO MAKE APPOINTMENTS THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR FOR US TO SAY THAT THAT SADDAM HAS GONE LIVE- AND IT DOESN'T ABOUT THAT'S EVEN. LOWER CONFUSING EXPECTATIONS. FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. RIGHT I. WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU- ALL THE MEMBERS OF MINISTRATION- HERE TODAY TO ANSWER SOME OF THESE TOUGH QUESTIONS AND HOPEFULLY- HELP US IMPROVE WHAT'S HAPPENING AS FAR AS EXPERIENCEBURKE CONSTITUENTS UNDERCOVER NINETEEN AS IT RELATES TO VACCINES- AND FRANKLY BUREAUCRACY- YOUR THIS IS BEEN. LET LET LET ME START WITH THIS CAN ANYONE ON HERE TELL ME. HOW MANY MASS VACCINATION SITES ARE IN L. A. COUNTY. ANYBODY ON THE PANEL HAVE THAT INFORMATION. I'LL BE DARNED IF THEY DON'T. DR GOD YOU KNOW HOW MANY SITES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY I KNOW THEY I WITH A PRESENTED THEY PRESENTED THAT THEY HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE SITES. THE I KNOW THEY HAVE ONE A DOCTOR STADIUM WHICH IS PROBABLY THEIR BIGGEST SITE. AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE SOME MEDIUM MEDIUM SIZED SITES BUT THAT I I'M NOT AWARE OF THE SIDES OF THE- OF THOSE SITES. IT AT THE POPULATION OF L. A. COUNTY IS ROUGHLY- TEN MILLION IS THAT. YOUR UNDERSTANDING. YES THAT IS A LITTLE OVER TEN MILLION THAT'S CORRECT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT POPULATION OF THE SILICON VALLEY THIS. I KNOW I DO NOT IT'S ROUGHLY FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE RUNNING FROM- BAKERSFIELD UP- THROUGH STUFF STOCKTON SAN JOAQUIN- THERE'S CURRENTLY ZERO MASS VACCINATION SITES- THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY I THINK WE HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE STILL DON'T HAVE A VACCINATION THAT SPECULATION SITE- OBVIOUSLY NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT IT'S INEXCUSABLE THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE LARGE SCALE VACCINATION SITES IN LA AND ZERO- IN FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES IF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WAS ITS OWN STATE WOULD BE THE TWENTY FIFTH LARGEST STATE IN THE COUNTRY. NO MASS VACCINATIONS ARE. D. DATA. THAT I KEEP GETTING. POINTS THERE WERE BACK TO THE GOLDEN RULE. HERE SHE WHO HAS THE GOLD MAKES THE RULES. AND LET ME SHARE A FEW DATA POINTS WITH YOU. I WENT LOOKED AT ALL THE COUNTIES BY MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. TURNS OUT THAT- SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND POINT 83% OF THE POPULATION BACKS AND. NAPA COUNTY WITH A MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS HAS 17% SANTA CRUZ AT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND AS 14% LOS ANGELES SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND HAS 11% WELL NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE HAVE NOTS. MERCED COUNTY MY HOME TOWN WELCOME. FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN THREE THREE MEDIAN INCOME FIVE POINT 49% OF THE POPULATION TAXES. KINGS COUNTY. 570005% OF THE POPULATION BACKS TULARE. FIFTY SIX THOUSAND SIX POINT 9% TEHAMA COUNTY FIFTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE MARIPOSA FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE POINT ZERO. WE GO ON ON THE WHAT APPEARS CLEAR IS THOSE THAT HAVE ARE GETTING VACCINATED. AND THOSE THAT DON'T ARE NOT END I DON'T KNOW YOU'RE A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WE GET THESE DEEP DIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DATA. WHEN IT FEELS LIKE WERE SKIRTING THE QUESTION OF JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE ROLL OUT RESOURCES AND EVERY COUNTY AND EVERY PART OF THE STATE. IN AS EQUAL- YEAH WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES LED TO GIVE LIP SERVICE TO EQUITY AS WELL- IT IT MEANS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN LANDS BUT SOME SENSE OF FAIRNESS WE'RE WE CONSIDER CONSTITUENTS YES. THERE'S A NATIONAL SHORTAGE BUT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE'RE ALL MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER. NOT THE SITUATION WHERE AN HOUR SOME COUNTIES MOVED FROM. TIER ONE TO THE NEXT YEAR SOME EXPAND POPULATIONS OTHERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO EVEN DO THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AND I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE MADE. LET ME GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THAT THE TWO OF US HAVE SPENT THE LAST NINE YEARS IN THIS BODY. TRIED TO FIGHT. FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION. IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ELEVEN PRIOR. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PLACES THAT. THE PHYSICIAN TO PATIENT RATIOS ARE DISMAL YOU KNOW AND IN MY HOMETOWN MY HOME COUNTY IT'S NINETY ONE. PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN- ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. END THOSE INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE PLAYING OUT IN THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE LEGITIMATELY DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT YOU ALL ARE DRESSING WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING TO TACKLE THE DATE ISSUES THAT THIS COMPUTER DONE TALK TO THAT COMPUTER BUT IN THE MEANTIME THE BASIC DATA POINTS THAT WE HAVE. ARE POINTING TO GROSS INEQUITIES AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE GET ANY ANSWERS IN THIS HEARING TODAY. OR IN ANY OF THE PUBLIC EFFORTS AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO TURN THAT AROUND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE NUMBER OF VACCINES IN ANY GIVEN JURISDICTION RELATES TO THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS ARE CASES OR- OR PERHAPS EVEN THE FATALITY RATE. OF THESE CASES RIGHT SOME RATIONAL COURSE THAT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE SENDING THE MONEY AND THE RESOURCES INSTEAD WHAT WE SEEM TO HAVE. IS A MISHMASH OF REASONS- RATIONALES EXCUSES AS TO WHY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE MORE. ARE STILL GETTING MORE AND THOSE OF US THAT HAVE LASSER AND EARNED A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION I'VE GOT ONE ADDITIONAL DATA POINT HERE I'LL SHARE WITH YOU. THAT- THAT WAS PASSED ON WITH ANOTHER MEMBER SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO- THE- ACCURACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. BUT AS IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO ME THIS COMPARES THE NUMBER OF. CASES TO THE NUMBER OF VACCINES RIGHT AND THEN GETS A PERCENTAGE SO- IN THE CASE FOR EXAMPLE OF KINGS COUNTY. YOU'VE GOT 210-002-0090 SEVEN- COATED NINETEEN CASES. THEY'VE RECEIVED SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR VACCINES SO THAT'S THIRTY SIX PERCENT- OF THE TOTAL CASE SUMMIT ACCENTS DOWN OTHER PLACES- FOR EXAMPLE. LOS ANGELES THEY'VE HAD ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE THOUSAND CASES AND THEY'VE RECEIVED ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND BACK SEEMS THERE ROUGHLY OVER. A ONE TO ONE RATIO SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A GROSS. INEQUITY AND SO. LET ME ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS. HAVING SHARED THOSE DATA POINTS WITH YOU- DO YOU AGREE THAT. WE'RE USING YOU KNOW BUT BY USING HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE AS PART OF THE FORMULA- AS TO HOW WE ALLOCATE VACCINES TO COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BASICALLY USING AN EQUITY TO JUSTIFY A FURTHER INEQUITY DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT OR WOULD YOU TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT- DOCTOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I DO I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR ANALYSIS WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING YOU'RE DOING THAT SOMEWHERE ANALYSIS ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THE LOWER THE LOWER INCOME AREAS OF THE STATE- ARE LESS FACT ARE LESS VACCINATED. AND- PART OF THE CONTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE THE DISTRIBUTION RELATED TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS. BUT I THINK EVEN THE MOST RECENT DATA AS PRESENTED BY LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHOWING THAT EVEN MORE RECENTLY WITHIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE IS- INEQUITIES IN WHO'S GETTING VACCINATED. AND I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE TRUE WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THE STATE DATA. SO I YEP WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY OUR EQUITY PATRICK. IN OUR APPROACH IS REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE FCUSED USING THAT HEALTHY PLACES INDEX. THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO FOCUS ON THOSE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE LOWER INCOME. SO AREAS LIKE MERCED WILL HAVE RECEIVE RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION AND MORE VACCINE AND MORE RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE EQUITY THAT YOU SUMMARIZED REALLY NICELY. MY PREVIOUS THAT THE- YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS- PARTICULARLY COMING FROM THEIR CULTURAL COMMUNITY WHERE MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE GONE TO WORK THROUGHOUT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF US CAN EAT IN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND WE'VE AT TIMES BEEN THE SUBJECT MY COMMUNITY OF KIND OF A HARSH CRITICISM THAT- WE WERE OUT WORK IN THAT THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH. SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE- WE HAD ONE OF THE CAUCUSES HERE I THINK LATINO CAUCUS OR WRITE A LETTER SUGGESTING- SOME OF OUR EMPLOYERS WERE ABUSING THEIR EMPLOYEES BY NOT HAVING THAT THE NECESSARY- MASS AND PRECAUTIONARY- THINGS IN PLACE. NOT I'VE HEARD DEAFENING SILENCE FROM ALL THE CAUCUSES NOW THAT THE VACCINES ARE NOBODY'S WRITTEN A LETTER SAYING HEY LET'S SEND SOME VACCINES TO MERCED COUNTY AND HELP OUT. THESE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN FEEDING US ALL FOR MANY MANY MONTHS SO IT'S FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST. I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT COUNTIES LIKE MERCED YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'VE GOT THE FIFTH HIGHEST DEATH RATE YET WE HAVE THE THIRD LOWEST ALLOCATION OF VACCINES. ARE GONNA GET TO INCREASE THE TENSION AND I KNOW THAT SOMETHING YOU ALL BEEN WORKING ON I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING. THE RESULTS OF INCREASED ALLOCATIONS INTO THESE COMMUNITIES. OF NEED. BUT I HOPE THAT WE CAN SHARE SOME OF THE STATE OF THAT I'VE RAISED WITH YOU HERE THIS AFTERNOON AND WHAT I CAN SHARE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. AND WE CAN REALLY START TO DRILL DOWN ON A- PATH FORWARD THAT'S NOT. EACH OF US TRYING TO TAKE FROM EACH OTHER BUT RATHER JUST A FAIR METRIC ACROSS ALL COUNTIES ACROSS ALL COMMUNITIES- WE DESPERATELY NEED TO GET- A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BACKSTAGE NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND- IT'S NOT LOST ON ME AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT LOST ON MY COLLEAGUES WHEN WE PICK UP THE NEWSPAPERS ARE READ ABOUT WHAT'S GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN MANY CASES THE SMALLER. MAYBE YOU COULD SAY EVEN MORE CONSERVATIVE. STATES THAT HAVE BEEN. LESS FOCUSED IN A WAY ON SPECIFIC POPULATIONS WERE RATHER JUST ROLLING THINGS OUT AND KIND OF GETTING RED TAPE AND BLOCKS ON THE WAY SEEM TO HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT SAME SUCCESS REPLICATED IN EVERY COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA LEAD THE WAY IN LOOKING THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS THROUGH- METRICS TO ENSURE. ACCESS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ALL COMMUNITIES THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE JUST MOVED THINGS FORWARD HERE AND- SOMETIMES CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY IN BARACK RECEIVE RED TAPE. I WAS JUST WATCHING BILL MAHER ON HBO RECENTLY AND MAYBE SOME YOU SAW THE SHOW APPARENTLY HE'S BEEN SPENDING FOR FIVE YEARS TRYING TO SOLDIER ON THROUGH CAN'T GET ENOUGH. IT LOOKS LIKE THE DOCTOR SAW THE SHOW. SO LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER IN PLEASE SEE THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW OUR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEE CHAIRS HERE WHO YOU KNOW HAD THE FORESIGHT TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ON THE OVERSIGHT YOU KNOW THE PROGRAMS BUT USE THIS IS A RESOURCE- PLEASE- I KNOW THERE'S- EVERYBODY'S- DROWNING IN THE AMOUNT OF. CHAOS AND DIFFICULTY AND CHALLENGING TIMES OUT THERE BUT LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER HERE TO ENSURE THAT WE- REYES- EVERYBODY'S BOAT. RIGHT NOT JUST- THE BIG COUNTIES YOU KNOW I MEAN I REALIZE WE HAVE A SPEAKER FROM LA AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY- IT HAS ALL THE- RESOURCES WE HAVE A PRO TEM FROM SAN DIEGO MAYBE THAT'S HELP IN SAN DIEGO. LET'S START FOCUSING ON THE WHOLE STATE I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR AGREES WITH ME ON THIS. BECAUSE THIS IS THE SAME GOVERNOR WHO ACTUALLY MADE THE INVESTMENT. IN A MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHO'S HAVE SUPPORTED MY COLLEAGUE IN RIVERSIDE GROWING MEDICAL PROGRAMS MORE NURSES MORE DOCS MORE HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. LESS BUREAUCRACY LESS RED TAPE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. RIGHT AT THE TOP LET'S I TRIED TO- TO GO TO THE ZOOM AND BRING ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD WHO IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY AND WOULD LIKE TO. ASK A QUESTION. GREAT THANK YOU THERE ARE CHAIRS IF YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY. I CAN HEAR OKAY YES WE CAN THANK YOU WONDERFUL NOW THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATIONS HERE TODAY FROM DOWN HERE IN SAN DIEGO- I. WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT ALL REALLY- DURING THE LOCAL SECTIONAL TO TAILOR THEM- TO THE STATEWIDE PANEL I APPRECIATE ON THE INFORMATION THE UPDATES- THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE- DOWN HERE WE HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARY OF THE EARLY PILOT WITH THE MY TERM PROJECTS AND I'VE GOTTA SAY ANECDOTALLY THAT WE'VE HAD. A LOT OF POSITIVE CONSTITUENT FEEDBACK BE EASE AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE INFORMATION TO EVEN SIGN UP FOR AN APPOINTMENT TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT NOTIFICATION WE ALSO HAD IT REALLY BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP WITH OUR NEW BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE PARTNERSHIP WITH UC SAN DIEGO HEALTH- THE ABILITY TO WORK ON ONE OF THE SUPERCENTERS THAT I KNOW WHEN I WAS HAPPY THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM WAS ABLE TO BE HERE. JUST THIS PAST MONDAY REALLY SEE HOW WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND SHOTS IN ARMS AND WE'RE ABLE TO DO A LOT MORE THROUGHPUT IT CAME WITH ITS INITIAL HICCUPS AND START UP CHALLENGES AND SO WE REALLY WORK THROUGH THOSE OPERATIONALLY ON THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT- YOU KNOW WE ARE SEEING SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS BECAUSE OF THIS ASSISTANCE AND I AM CERTAINLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I'M ALSO MINDFUL FOR SOME COLLEAGUES ON THE MY TURN SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR LOCAL COUNTIES ARE HAVING SOME INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT THEY FEEL ARE WORKING WELL AND SO I WOULD WANT TO UNDERSCORE AND- REALLY SUPPORT THEM IF THEY FEEL LIKE- THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORKING GREAT DON'T BREAK IT- AND MAKE SURE THAT MY TURN IS INTEGRATED WELL AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE ABLE TO NOT HAVE THAT. ADDITIONAL HICK UPS BECAUSE EVERYDAY MATTERS IN THE BUSINESS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO MY TURN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HAD DOWN HERE IN SAN DIEGO IS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF VACCINES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH AND- HOW FAST WE CAN GET THE NOW. WE HADN'T NOTICED THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING IN FROM DISTRICT FROM DIFFERENT TO DIFFERENT POINTS WHETHER IT'S DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTY- TO- INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS TO PHARMACIES- UNIQUELY DOWN HERE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- IS MY TURN OR OTHER SOME OF THESE LARGER SYSTEMS ABLE TO NOW BETTER TALK TO EACH OTHER. TO REALLY GIVE US A REAL TIME SCENARIO- HAT WE HAVE TO WORK. WHERE IT GOING- THIS IS TO LEAD AND MY NECK. QUESTION. HI THIS IS AMY AGAIN- I'LL TAKE A STAB AT THE- TRYING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION- BUT I MAY HAVE TO ASK THE- DOCTOR GOING TO SPEAK TO THE- ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIVERY OF THE HOUSE. SO ONE OF THE INTENT- IS DEFINITELY TO HAVE A BETTER INTEGRATION ONCE MY TURN IT'S BEING YOU KNOW I. WROTE OUT STATEWIDE INTERMIXED ENJOYING. AND THE GOAL FROM THERE IS THAT- WITH THE ANTICIPATED- DOES COMING IN THERE IS INFORMATION COMING FROM THE- CDC. DATABASE ARE TELLING US WHEN THAT THOSE THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED AND ARRIVE. BASED ON THAT THERE IS A- ALLOCATION PROCESS AND BASED ON ALLOCATION PROCESS AND THE COUNTY IN THIS CASE. WOULD HAVE A BETTER KNOWLEDGE WHEN THE- HENCE THE THEY CAN START. DOES THIS IS OUT HE SO. THEY HAVE DIRECT DELIVERY STRAIGHT TO WALGREENS OR STRAIGHT TO- THE DOT. IS NOT GOING THROUGH THE STATE'S EATERS- YOU KNOW PHYSICALLY GOING THROUGH THE SYSTEM OF THE STATE- ALLOCATION PROCESS OR RE LEAST AWARE OF THAT BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING HERE. OF THE TOTALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTY REGARDLESS OF WHO ULTIMATELY RECEIVING IT. RIGHT SO I DO WANT TO DIFFERENTIATE SO WALGREEN BELONGS TO WHAT IS NOT A PHARMACY PROGRAM AND THAT'S DIRECTLY COMING FOM THE FEDERAL. IN THE PHARMACY PROGRAM IN TERMS OF DELIVERY AND TRACKING NOT COME THROUGH MY TURN. MY FEET YEAH THAT THAT'S- IT- SO THAT COULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT- JUST SO WE KIND OF REAL TIME KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH AND WHAT'S GOING WHERE ON JUST SO WE CAN ADJUST IF NECESSARY. WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR CONTROL AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT THERE AS A WORKING THROUGH THE TEARS AND THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS HERE- IT'S IT THAT THAT'S ONE SORT OF- OPEN QUESTION IS STILL OUT THERE HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THE TOTALITY. OF WHAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH ON THIS DOES GET INTO MY NEXT QUESTION ABOUT EQUITY AND- AND IT. LOOKS OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLYMEMBER GREAT SAID TO- THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS I'M SENSITIVE AND I CERTAINLY AM EMPATHETIC AND- TO- MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST. ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT ARE RECEIVING EXTRA ATTENTION TO MAKE SHORE- THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THEM THAT WE'RE GETTING THEM UP TO THE STATUS OF GOOD HEALTH AND GOOD SECURITY- FOR THEIR FUTURE HEALTH- I RECOGNIZE THAT WERE A DIFFERENT COUNTY LEVELS WORKING ON YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT HERE- THAT YOUR CRITERIA AND EVERYBODY IS SLIGHTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES- DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS- FOR ME I WANT TO KNOW IN THIS BROAD CALCULUS. ESPECIALLY AS WERE IMPROVING THIS REAL TIME DATA THROUGH MY TURN ARE YOU STARTING TO LOOK AT- WHERE- WE ARE SEEING REAL TIME INFECTION RATES SO WHERE WE ARE SEEING. SOME OF THE BIGGEST- CHANGES IN MAYBE NEW AT. IF WE HAVE REGION THE STATE OR S. LOCALITY. THAT WE ARE DEEPLY. WITH CAN THERE BE SOME MASSAGING OF THAT DELIVERY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING IN THERE BEFORE THAT OUTBREAK REALLY CAUSES MAJOR. PROBLEMS IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. I CAN GO AHEAD. AND TAKE THAT- THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- FIRST AYE AYE I WANNA MAKE ONE COMMENT ABOUT ABOUT MY TURN THAT I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THE REGARD REGARDLESS OF- THE STATE ALSO HAS AN IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY. WHICH WE CALL CARE FOR CATS- CALIFORNIA MUSICIAN REGISTRY. REGARDLESS THE WORTH OF THE GET THE MINISTER YOU HAVE TO GO INTO A SAID ELECTRONIC SYSTEM SOME SYSTEM. EVENT COMMUNICATES TO CARE. ITSELF THE KAISER'S MOST OF MOST THE MUSIC APPLIQUE LIKE TRONIC HEALTH RECORD IT COMMUNICATES TO CARE IF YOU GET AT A MEGASITE THE USING MY TURN. IT CAN IT COMMUNICATES INTO CARE SO CARRY VASTLY BECOMES OF. THE PLACE OF RECORD OF EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN VACCINATED CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING TO REGIONAL IMMUNIZATION REGISTRIES UPDATED TO CARE WHICH IS SAN DIEGO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE IS REALLY OUR TESTING SYSTEM RIGHT. SO THIS IS YOUR BREAKING UP A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE YOU'RE BRINGING UP INFECTION RATES. START WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO GET TESTED. YES IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS EVEN IF YOU DON'T EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE SYMPTOMS AND YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR STATUS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO HIGHER RISK ABSOLUTELY GET TESTED BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL NOT PICK UP THE SIGNALS WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER. I COMMUNITIES HAVING MORE INFECTION. AND SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S REALLY VERY VERY POOR THANK YOU FOR GOING OUT. SO IF THE TESTING GOES WELL DO YOU THINK THAT WE CAN GET TO A POINT SOON THAT THAT'S A PART OF THE CALCULUS OF. HOW YOU'RE ALLOCATING FORTHCOMING- THAT MILES WELL WE HAVE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU KNOW A NEW SURGERY NEW RISE JUST IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OR JUST IN THIS. COMMUNITY WITHIN SAN DIEGO COUNTY DOT KNOWN DATA I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL CATIONS CAN HELP TO SUPPORT THAT SO IT DOESN'T BLOW UP INTO A HEALTH CARE CRISIS LOCALLY. YEAH YES SO YOU'RE BREAKING UP A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THAT IS IT'S ALMOST LIKE FIRES IF THERE'S A HOT SPOT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DETECT IT SO YOU CAN GO IN THERE AND VACCINATE. AND THAT'LL BE PART OF THE STATEWIDE STRATEGY IN TERMS OF SURVEILLANCE OF LOOKING FOR HOT SPOTS BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- THAT THE EQUITY METRIC AND FOCUSING ON. HOW THE PLACES INDEX AND. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HELPS US. HOWEVER THE HOT SPOT NEAR. RIGHT BECAUSE- RIGHT TAXES MOVE THROUGH IN YOUR YOUR ABSOLUTE CORRECT. OKAY THINK THAT THANK YOU I LOOK FOR TO MINOR AND I HOPE THAT THAT BECOMES A- OF OUR- WE GOING- CLOSE. WITH- I'M OF THAT THAT NUMBER THE LGBT. AND OUR LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- I HAD A CONCERN I WANT TO PASS ON FROM A LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS YOU NEED TO FIND THAT. OUT REALLY SEE SOME OF THE DISTRIBUTION ON THE ISSUES FAILING- LGBTQ PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES- AND I'M WONDERING THIS WASN'T REALLY MEANT FOR THE LOCAL PANEL THAT PERHAPS YOU CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF YOUR GUIDANCE. FOR LOCALITIES MORE BROADLY FOR THOSE WITH ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES- THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH LONG LINES THAT NEED ASL INTERPRETATION- THAT HAVE WHEELCHAIR CHALLENGES- IS NOT BEING A PART OF THE GUIDANCE AND THAT THE- RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU'RE MAKING TO. ANY WEATHER TO SUPERCENTER ANY POINT OF DELIVERY- SAID THAT- PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES OR THOSE CHALLENGES ARE- YOU BLEED- AND TREATED. SO CURRENTLY BOTH ARE. COMMUNITY COMMITTEE. AND OUR DRAFTING GUIDELINES COMMITTEES WORKING ON GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE. IT MAY BE FIVE TO AGE THE OTHER CATEGORIES THAT WERE ADDRESSING IS PERSONS WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT PUT THEM AT HIGHER HIGHER RISK FOR DYING. AND PERSONS WHO HAVE DISABILITY AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE WORKING WITH- DISABILITY ADVOCATES TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. AND WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON IMPLEMENTATION PLANTS OKAY. YOU SHOULD SEE THAT HOPEFULLY WITHIN- PROBABLY WITHIN DAYS BECAUSE IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT NEWS TO HEAR FOR THEM ALL PASSED THAT ON LAST WEEK- FOR I HEARD I THINK FROM THE- MISS RODRIGUEZ FROM THE OFFICE OF THE OVERNOR. A NOTE THAT YOU WERE GOING TO WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT ACROSS ALL OF OUR- AREAS OF EQUITY WHETHER IT'S- BASED ON. RACE OR GENDER OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. OR DISABILITY THAT WERE LOOKING FOR HE'S ACTUALLY EQUITY METRICS FOR TRACKING- VACCINE DISTRIBUTIONS AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU MIGHT BE AWARE- WE'VE HAD A FROM A CAUCUS PERSPECTIVE A CHALLENGE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF SB NINE THIRTY TWO FROM LAST YEAR AND- UNDERSTOOD WAS- DIRECTED- DPH TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TRACKING COOL THEY TEST RESULTS. ARE BASED ON ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY IF THEY SO CHOSE TO DISCLOSE THAT SO HOW ARE WE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WE STILL HAVEN'T REALLY UNDERSTOOD WE'RE HEARING FROM- PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT STILL IS NOT BEING COLLECTED. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE ARE REALLY REACHING THE- POPULATION OR NOT COMMUNITY THROUGH VACCINATIONS- EVER STILL CHALLENGE OR CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE TO FIND IT THAT'S IT HAS NOT BEEN- CIRCULATED BACK TO US. THE CODE TEST RESULTS BASED. ON ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY. I'M THANK YOU FOR THE CORE. I DON'T KNOW IF THE MY CELL RODRIGUEZ HAS HAS AN ANSWER TO THAT- BUT OTHERWISE. I KNOW I KNOW THAT'S A GAP AREA. WE MET RECENTLY WITH- CENTER SCOTT WIENER ON THIS VERY ISSUE. TO SORT OF GET GET EXACTLY WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK. BUT IT IS IT'S AN AREA THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE HAS TO BE FIXED. WELL I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS AT THE MOMENT BUT I CAN I CAN MAKE SURE TO GET IT I DON'T KNOW BUT IT'S A LOT HAS ANY. ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. YES I WANTED TO AND THAT WOULDN'T THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO LAYER DIFFERENT DATA POINTS SO THAT WE CAN CAPTURE- AS MUCH OF THE POPULATION THAT HAS BEEN- AND DISPROPORTIONATE PACKET BY CO THAT AND- AND TAKING SORT OF. YOU KNOW INSIGHTS FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST. THIS IS JUST SIMPLY THE DEFENSIVE EFFORT BY MENTION WORK. LOOKING AT H. P. I WERE LOOKING AT THE HARD TO COUNT AND THAT SOMEWHERE LIKE LOOKING ECHO THE POSITIVITY DATE. DATA AND SO. HOPING WITH THE FLARING OF DATA THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE TRAVELING- THE RIGHT POPULATIONS AND THEN AS WE WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY HAVE TO REACH INTO THOSE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES- SO LAYERING ON DIFFERENT APPROACHES DIFFERENT DATA. AND TO TRY AND INFORM OUR EFFORTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. OKAY THANK YOU I Y. PRESET THAT RESPONSE IF YOU CAN KEEP OUR CAUCUS AND SENATOR WIENER APPRISED OF- AGAIN CONNECTING THESE DOTS GOING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DATA. FROM D. TESTING INFORMATION AND SO WE CAN REALLY CONNECT WITH OXIDATION IS TO SEE IF THERE ARE. FURTHER DISPARITIES ABOUT REACHING PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- TO MY EARLIER POINT ABOUT EQUITY- IT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ABOUT A CAUCUS ON THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE PRESENTATION. FOR THE TIME TODAY FOR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON. THANK YOU MADAM AND THAT IS WHAT I AS OUR PAN FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION- YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE VACCINE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK HAS CHANGED FOUR TIMES SINCE SINCE DECEMBER AND- I HAVE SEVERAL OF YOU MENTIONED- YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES WITH. GETTING ACCURATE DATA- BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT- ESSENTIAL WORKERS POSSIBLY BEING LEFT BEHIND. IN THIS VACCINATION ROLLOUT IN PROCESS- YOU KNOW THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF CONFUSION- FROM GROCERY CLERK SAID DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY CAN GET VACCINATED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SURE BECAUSE THE INFORMATION KEEPS CHANGING. SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. I'LL GO AHEAD AND MAKE THEM MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE PHASE ONE B. E. R. WITCHING WHICH INCLUDES- AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT SIXTY FIVE IN THE THREE THE THREE SECTORS. WHICH IS EDUCATION EDUCATION CHILD KERR FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL AND THEN EMERGENCY RESPONDENTS. SO WE HAVE PUT UP ON THE WEBSITE THERE IS IN AND OUT. MAKING OPERATIONAL DOES REQUIRE A LOT OF EXTRA A LOT OF EXTRA WORK BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE ASK OKAY- IF I IF I WORK IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY DO I QUALIFY. AND SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF DOING SEX THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT SLOW IT SLOWS THINGS DOWN. I'M HONOR WEBSITE THERE IS A LINK THAT HAS THAT THAT'S BASED ON OUR ESSENTIAL- ESSENTIAL JOB CLASSIFICATIONS THAT HAS BEEN UP THERE FOR A LONG TIME WHICH THAT DEFINE THE SOCIAL WORKERS. AND IT HAS THOSE SPECIFIC BILL SPECIFIC CATEGORIES ARE DEFINED ONLINE AND THAT WILL HELP THAT WILL HELP IN TERMS OF THE OUR REGION AND THE TARGETING. THE CHALLENGE WITH SECTORS IS REALLY GOING TO BE VERIFICATION. AND SO THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A TREND THAT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A CHALLENGE WITH SECTORS- AND THAT'S WHY WORKING WITH EMPLOYERS WORKING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS REALLY HAVING TARGETED OUTREACH. AND VACCINATION SITES THAT ARE MORE DIRECTLY INTERACTING WITH THOSE WORKERS IS IT'S GOING TO BE OUT I THINK PROBABLY MORE SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY. AND HOW THAT PLAYS OUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME. AND I THINK THIS IS PART OF THE OUTRAGE IS GONNA BE REALLY POOR THE STOCK UP ON MY CELL- RODRIGUEZ IS WORKING ON- I HOPE. THAT ANSWERS THE MOST YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU. ACTUALLY HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ALSO RELATED TO THE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK- AS THE NUMBER CALDERON NOTED IT'S CHANGED BOB I THINK FOUR TIMES SINCE SINCE DECEMBER IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE STILL. FINALIZING SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THAT- I GUESS CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY THIS IS CHANGING WE'VE HAD WE'VE HAD ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING SINCE APRIL WHY DO WE KEEP CHANGING THIS AND- BECAUSE- QUESTION ONE NUMBER TO. THINK RECOGNIZING THAT CONSISTENCY AND CLARITY IS A REALLY REALLY CRITICAL BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR OUR PARTNERS- ARE YOU GONNA KEEP CHANGING THE FRAMEWORK OR CAN WE SAY THIS IS THAT THIS IS OUR PLAN. AND IT'S ALL SYSTEMS GO. YES SIR IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS PUBLISHED ONLINE THERE WAS ONE A- ONE EIGHT DID NOT CHANGE. ONE B. HOW TO TEARS. PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY STARTED PHASE ONE B. TIER ONE- THAT INITIALLY HAD ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE IN THE SECTOR GROUPS. SOME AREAS STARTED TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY MOVED THROUGH PHASE ONE DAY IN THEIR AREA FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS MORE TRUE OF NON URBAN AREAS THEY HAD ALREADY VACCINATED HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THEIR EVENT AND DEPENDING ON THEIR THEIR WORK FORCE THEY HAD ALREADY GOTTEN THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE BXLEY THE TEACHERS AND PEOPLE THAT THAT QUALIFIED AND THEY WERE READY TO MOVE ON TO PHASE ONE B. SO WE SAID IF YOU'RE READY TO MOVE ON TO PHASE ONE BEATS HERE ONE GO AHEAD. THE FIRST CHANGE WE MADE WAS WE TOOK IT WAS AGE SEVENTY FIVE IN A BOX. WE ACTUALLY MOVED IT DOWN TO SIXTY FIVE IN A BAR IN THERE REALLY WAS JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA- OF THE DEATHS IN CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA SO PERSON SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER AND MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND LATINO. AND SO THAT. SO WAS WHAT I WAS THE OUR DATA WITH. AT THAT WE- HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND WE'RE RECOGNIZING THEIR SEX DEBATE SECTOR BASED APPROACH. IS SLOWER BECAUSE OF THE VERIFICATION ISSUE. I DON'T REALLY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE RECOGNIZE INCLUDING OFFICES. RECOGNIZE THAT TAKING AN AGE BUT IT'S TAKING A MORE DELIBERATE AGE BASED APPROACH. WAS NOT ONLY MORE ETHICAL WHO'S GONNA BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SAVING LIVES. AND ALSO IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF EQUITY IN TERMS OF. PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE AGE WISE. AND SO THAT WAS A THAT WAS THE FIRST CHANGE THAT WE MADE. ON THE SECOND THE SECOND CHANGE THAT WE MADE IT IS REALLY NOT WHAT HASN'T COME IS GONNA BE THIS WHAT'S GONNA COME NEXT. WHICH IS GOING TO BE A RECOGNIZING THAT. AGES IMPORTANCE AGE IS REALLY THE FIRST ONE TO FOCUS ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE BIGGEST RISK IS YOU HEARD EARLIER AND SOME OF THE TESTIMONY. WE ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE HAVE CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS THE PERSON WHO HAVE SEVERE DISABILITIES. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES NOT ONLY HAVE THE RISK OF. DYING FROM KOBE. WHICH SHOULD THEY GET INFECTED THEY HAVE THEY HAVE. CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF GETTING THEY MAY BE HOME BROWN THEIR CHALLENGES. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE SITES WERE VACCINATIONS AND KERR. SO THEY PROVIDE UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND SO WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT FROM AN EQUITY ISSUE. SO THAT'S REALLY THAT THAT'S REALLY THE SECOND CHANGE IN OF ALL MENTION OF THE LAST ONE. THE LAST ONE IS THE ONE THAT I JUST MENTIONED TO YOU WHICH IS. ONLINE GIVING MORE SPECIFICITY TO WHAT WE MEAN BY THOSE. GAPS SECTORS. ARE BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED MORE SPECIFICITY SO HEALTH CARE WORKERS NEED TO KNOW WHERE I'M A HEALTH CARE WORKER BUT- WHERE EXACTLY. ARE THESE INCLUDE TENSES OF THAT INCLUDE OTHER SECTORS. SO THAT'S ALL BEEN CLARIFIED ONLINE SO THAT PEOPLE. HAVE THAT HAVE A SPECIFIC. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M SO. CURRENT PRIORITY OF ONE A AND ONE. HOW MANY THE ADULTS IS THAT MEN LIKE TEND. ADULTS FIVE I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER ON THE BUT IT IS ONLINE WE GO ONLINE AND YOU LOOK AT IF YOU GO TO COPE WITH COVER NINETEEN DOT CA DOT GOV. AND YOU ARE YOU ARE FIND A VACCINE LINK WHEN YOU GO DOWN TO THERE THEY ACTUALLY HAS THE ACTUAL NUMBER FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT FIT THAT CATEGORY. OKAY DID I GET SO IT'S THERE BUT IT'S IN THE IT'S IN THE MILLIONS IT'S A BIG GROUP IT IS IT'S A BIG GROUP OF SENIOR I MEAN SIXTY FIVE AND OVER LOAN IS NOT MILLION SO IT'S SOMETHING TO. CORRECT CORRECT SIX SIX BILLION IN SERVING OUT ON OUT ON THAT THE SECT THE SECTOR GROUPS AND THEN THERE'S GONNA BE SOME SOME OVERLAP BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THAT SECTOR GROUP INTERNAL DISCIPLINE SIXTY FIVE. AND THAT THAT TOTAL NUMBER MIGHT BE TEN MILLION BUT. I HAVE TO FIND A LIKE TO BE MORE PRECISE. AND SEVEN IT. ACT AS MAY AN ANSWER. AND THEN. AND AFTER. QUESTION SO. THE UP. IS THAT WHEN WE ARE. MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SOME TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WERE NOW ELIGIBLE IS PART OF A PRIORITY GROUP FOR THE VACCINE- AT A MOMENT WHEN WE WERE ONLY I THINK RECEIVING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND VACCINES PER WEEK. THAT REALLY DID CREATE SERIOUSLY UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND- THAT. RESULTED IN DISAPPOINTMENT AND FRUSTRATION AND I THINK CONFUSION SO I MIGHT MAKE. OR MY REQUEST IS THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE ASPIRATIONAL. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO SET AMBITIOUS GOALS BUT MY REQUEST IS THAT WE SET REALLY CLEAR GOALS THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON SAID THAT WE DO NOT SET OURSELVES UP FOR DISAPPOINTING OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON OUR REFLECTION YEAH. WE AGREE WITH YOU- YEAH IT IMPROVING IMPROVING COMMUNICATION BECOMING FASTER SCALING UP. AND THE CHALLENGE TO IT WHAT YOU DESCRIBED- ABSOLUTELY AND INTERACT WITH JUST THE VERY ABILITY IS ACROSS COUNTIES. AND SO THAT THAT FEEDS INTO THE FRUSTRATION SO YEAH WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT- MR GALLAGHER. YES I SERVICE THROUGH THE QUESTIONS HERE ON. FIRST OF ALL WE TALKED ABOUT TRANSPARENCY EQUITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THINK WE ESTABLISHED IN THE SYRIAN THERE'S BEEN NONE OF THAT UP UNTIL THIS POINT. SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE FAILED ON THOSE ISSUES SO. TO DEAL WITH ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST GOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. SO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED THUS FAR. IS THE GOVERNOR RESPONSIBLE. R. R. THIS IS A DOCTOR AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU- LIFE BY THE IS A STATE HEALTH OFFICER I'M AND AS A FORMER OF LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER- KIRKER CITY COUNTY YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S I THINK WE ALL HAVE IT ALL OF US ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY- WORLD NEWS LEADER. WHOSE WE- WHEN SAY THAT WELL WHEN I SAY WHEN I SAY WE YES OF FOR ME WE I'VE WORKED AND I WORKED FOR GOVERNMENT ALL MY- PUBLIC HEALTH CAREER SO I SEE IT I SEE IT AS GOVERNMENT HAVING A REAL CENTRAL ROLE BOTH LOCAL LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY HAVING. LOCAL ROLE AND REALLY DELIVER DELIVERY DELIVERING ON WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING OKAY BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AND WHO DO WE GO TO THE TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT IS THAT YOU BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW NONE OF THESE MEMBERS HAVE HAD ANY SAY IN HOW THIS IS ROLLED OUT I WASN'T IN THE ROOM WITH YOU. DECIDE HOW THIS WOULD BE DONE HOW I GET DISTRIBUTED YOU KNOW THE CHAIRS OF THIS COMMITTEE WEREN'T THERE SO ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW IT HAS BEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH OFFICIALS WHO'VE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SO ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FAILURE YES OR NO. I'M I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH- IT'S I MEAN I'M NEW TO THE DEPARTMENT OF IT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF MY SIX WEEK FOR YES ARE ARE RESPONSIBLE AND THE DECISIONS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING ARE REALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND WE REALLY RELY ON THE SCIENTIFIC WORKGROUPS MOWING I MENTIONED EARLIER ON. WE HAD THREE THREE GROUPS WANT TO FOCUS ON SAFETY THE OTHER ONE FOCUSING ON DRAFTING GUIDELINES AND THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH REALLY REPRESENTS BROUGHT BROUGHT STAKEHOLDERS NOT FROM NOT JUST THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT ALSO SCIENTIFIC EXPERTISE TO REALLY HELP US CRAFT- AND DEVELOP DEVELOP DO DECISIONS ARE REALLY SERVE THE BEST THE BEST INTEREST IN TERMS OF. SIZE SCIENCE AND ADVOCACY AND ALL AND EVERYTHING TO GET ALSO DESCRIBED SO THAT'S GOOD AND THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO START WE JUST WANT TO. ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE MOVE FORWARD NOW LET ME GO TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF. THERE'S BEEN VERY SMART. DOT SCIENCE AND IN THIS- BUT DO YOU THINK THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF HOW THIS IS GONNA IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION GETTING THE VACCINE AND ARMS IS IT MAYBE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THERE WHO KNOW HOW TO DISTRIBUTE. IMPLEMENT. THAT THAT'S NOT YOUR EXPERTISE IS IT I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH YOU KNOW PRIVATE. BUSINESS FOLKS WHO ARE USED TO GETTING OUT THINGS ON A MASS SCALE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS. WITH WHY WE DIDN'T GET THINGS OUT AS- AS QUICKLY AND AS EQUITABLY AS POSSIBLE. YEAH THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND SORT OF BY AM. THE WELCOME THIRTY WAS WHEN WE WERE FIRST DOING TESTING EARLY ON IN TESTING WHEN IF YOU REMEMBER EARLY ON AND TESTING IT TOOK AWHILE FOR US TO GET ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO DO TO DO TESTING ADDED IN A REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR TESTING HAPPENED IT DIDN'T IT REQUIRED. REALLY PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO MAKE TESTING MORE SUCCESSFUL. RUSSELL IS A RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD TO BE TRUE FOR THE VACCINATION I FEEL LIKE. WE'VE BEEN VACCINATING THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE VACCINES FOR SPROUT HERE DECEMBER FOURTEENTH. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN REALLY IN US HISTORY THAT WE HAVE A MASSIVE. VACCINATION PROGRAM. AND SO IT BEGINS YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE EXPECTED THAT WOULD TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS FOR US TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT TO. TO GET THROUGH THE- TO GET UP AND RUNNING SO TO SPEAK SO TO SPEAK. ND IT'S GOING TO IT IS GOING TO TAKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S GONNA TAKE PHARMACIES. HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS EMPLOYERS. FIVE IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR ARE COMPLETELY FREE. RENSO MAVI I MEAN I'M I'M NOT A QUESTION TO YOU BUT JUST FROM THAT. OBVIOUSLY IF WE LEARN THAT FROM TESTING WHY DID WE APPLY THOSE THINGS NOW. AND AGAIN IF WE KNEW THAT'S THE CASE WHY DIDN'T WHY DIDN'T WE INVOLVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE. AS WE STARTED TO ROLL THIS OUT I THINK THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE BETTER MAKE SURE WE DO GOING FORWARD- PRIORITIZATION. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE- WE'VE ALL KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME NOW THAT IT WAS THOSE SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM THIS VIRUS. SO IF WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A LONG TIME WHY WASN'T THAT IN. YOUR TIER ONE EIGHT TWO ONE B. FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU KNOW. I MEAN WHY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO PRIORITIZE THEM FIRST NO IT WAS ACTUALLY IT WAS ACTUALLY IN THERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING SO WE WORK FROM THE NATIONAL GUIDELINES THAT INCLUDED FROM THE CDC- NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE AND ALSO THE- ACIP THEY MENTIONED EARLIER SO ALL THE SCIENTIFIC BODIES GAVE US THAT INITIAL FRAMEWORK THAT INITIAL FRAMEWORK INCLUDED HEALTH CARE WORKERS BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGH RISK AND WE NEED THEM TO TREAT US. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WHERE YOU REALLY HAVE THE MOST VULNERABLE WE NEED FROM THE DATA SO THAT ONCE FACED ONE DEALT WITH THE MOST AND THEN TEAR ONE OF BE ONE HAD SEVENTY FIVE AND OLDER SO THAT WAS THE THAT WAS BAKED IN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING BASED ON DATA. OF THE SEARCH THE SEARCH AND LOOKING AT OUR DATA MADE US MADE US RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO REALLY TIGHTEN THAT UP AND WE TIED IT UP BY MOVING DOWN TO SIXTY FIVE BUT THAT WAS IN THERE IT WAS IN THEIR FRONT FROM THE BEGINNING BASED ON SCIENCE I'M AT THE CRIB- AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. RIGHT WITHIN YOUR DEPARTMENT AND DR SISI ON POINTED THIS OUTTHE FIRST PANEL AND SHE SHE LAID OUT THE TIMELINE VERY WELL ON JANUARY THIRTEENTH YOU WERE TELLING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS YOU HAVE TO DO SIXTY FIVE PLUS IN ORDER OR OLDER FIRST. BEFORE YOU GO TO PHASE ONE B. IS THAT RIGHT. NO NO NO IT'S- WHAT WE SAID WAS WHAT WE SAID WAS- WHICH WE DROP THE H. DRIVE THE H. AND WE ASKED THEM TO PRIORITIZE PRIORITIZE AGE AND THE SECTOR GROUPS STILL STAYED IN THERE AND WE ASK THEM TO ALSO ANSWER VACCINATING OLDER PERSONS ALSO PRIORITIZE THAT THE GROUPS AS A SUB CATEGORY WELL THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S NOT LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH. IS THAT MEMBER GALLAGHER CAN YOU AS ONE MORE QUESTION SO CAN MOVE ON TO YEAH MISTER SEA ARTISTS AND GIVE I'M SAYING THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE SAID IS THAT THAT WAS THE DIRECTIVE AND THEN ON FEBRUARY FOURTH YOU GOT THE GOVERNOR CAME OUT WITH THE DIRECTIVE THAT YOU COULD DO BOTH. CATEGORIES OKAY CORRECT CORRECT CORRECT BUT NOW IT WOULD BE ON THE ON THE SECTORS AND RAISES MY LAST QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOW WE HAVE CONFUSION. WE HAVE SOME COUNTIES. THAT ARE SAYING NO WE CAN ONLY DO SIXTY FIVE AND PLUS WE WILL NOT MOVE TO THE OTHER ONE BE. CATEGORIES SO GROCERY CLERKS- FARMWORKERS- TEACHERS AND OTHER STAFF IN OUR IN OUR SCHOOLS THEY CANNOT GET VACCINATED IN THESE COUNTIES BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN A DIRECTOR THEY SAID THEY FIRST GOT FROM YOU GUYS. TO ONLY DO SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER FIRST SO SOME COUNTIES HAVE THAT AND OTHERS ARE VACCINE AS WE SAID A VACCINATED. HAVE GONE WAY INTO ONE B. AND VACCINATED NOW WE DO MY TURN. IS THAT GONNA CHANGE. WHEN A PERSON SIGNS UP IN YUBA AND SUTTER COUNTIES WERE AT WORK ONE OF THE COUNTIES I REPRESENT. IF THEY SIGN UP ON MY TURN IN THEIR OVER SIXTY FIVE OR THEIR OR THEY'RE A WORKER IN ONE B. ARE THEY GOING TO GET AN APPOINTMENT OR THEY'RE GOING TO GET TOLD NO YOU'RE COUNTY DOESN'T ALLOW YOU. TO MOVE INTO THOSE ONE B. UNIFORM ACROSS THE STATE OR NOT. IT'S GOING TO BE UNIFORM AND THAT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE NEEDED TO MOVE TO MY TURN FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING ABSOLUTELY I WE AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED TO HAVE UNIFORMS WE NEED HAVE UNIFORM STANDARDS. OKAY AND WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU AND HOLD. YOU ACCOUNTABLE IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE. RIGHT. WELL IT'S A IT'S A WHOLE TEAM IT'S A WHOLE TEAM OF FOLKS- I DO RUN THE DEPARTMENT BUT AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER YOU'LL SEE THAT WE REALLY ALL HANDS ARE ON DECK ALL ALL THE IS NOT NOT JUST NOT JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT WE ALSO HAVE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- WE HAVE A- SECRETARY A LOT OF RICHARDSON AND HER AND HER GROUP SO IT'S REALLY IT'S A IT'S AN ALL STATE EFFORT RIGHT WILL COOK WILL HOLD YOU ALL ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT BECAUSE I DO HOPE THIS CHANGES. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT AS FOR THE NUMBER SEVEN HI DOCTOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REALLY- THESE ARE ARE PRETTY PROBABLY BASIC AND EASIER TO ANSWER SO THE ALLOCATION OF VACCINES BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH VACCINES THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD BEFORE ON THIS FIRST PANEL AND- IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING MORE VACCINES IS THAT ALLOCATION- FROM THE FEDS ARE THEY THE ONES THAT DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION GIVEN TO THE STATE OR IS IT UP TO US TO ASK FOR WHAT WE NEED AND THEN. IN ORDER THAT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I BELIEVE. IS WHAT THEY ALLOW US AYE I'M NOT TOO SURE BLOCKER IS ON THE LINE SHE CAN SHE'SACTUALLY MAY ACTUALLY KNOW THE EXACT. THE EXACT DETAILS MAY SEEM IF TO TRASH I CAN ANSWER THEM. SURE GOOD AFTERNOON- IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATION WHERE WHERE ALLOCATED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WALKING ONCE A WEEK AND WE TAKE THAT ENTIRE ALLOCATION AND SPLIT IT UP ACCORDING TO THE ORMULA FOR THAT. ARE THE PRIORITY GROUP- AT THAT TIME. HOW DID THEY DETERMINE WHAT OUR ALLOCATION SHOULD BE- WE THEY SHOULD. BE GIVING US. ACCORDING TO THE FORMER. THEY THE DOES. THEY HAVE DOES IS TO GIVE THE FEDERAL. FOR TO PER. AND THEN THAT THAT AND THE TURN IS TO THIS. PER THEIR A- SO WE SHOULD BE REQUESTING WHAT ARE COUNTIES NEED IN THERE ARE MAXIMUM CAPACITY. BECAUSE THAT HELPS US MEET THAT GOAL OF REPEATEDLY YOU KNOW GETTING THINGS OUT IN A RAPID FASHION. AND I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. WHERE THAT THAT BOTTLENECK IS. BECAUSE WE KEEP HEARING WE CAN DO MORE IF WE JUST HAVE THE VACCINE. I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF- KIND OF US. BEING ABLE TO REQUEST A SPECIFIC AMOUNTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT TRACKS PRETTY CLOSELY TO THE POPULATION OF EACH STATE AFTER- WHATEVER WEEKLY ALLOCATION AS A TERMINATION WIDE- AND IS YOU KNOW GIVEN TO. OUR FEDERAL ENTITIES AND THEN THE REST PUT UP AMONGST THE STATE INSTANCE ON THE OTHER FOOT. SO THAT WOULD BE ONE SUGGESTION I WOULD SAY IS THEY REALLY SHOULD BE TRACKING THAT ARE ALLOCATING IT MORE BASED ON. OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER IT- IF WE HAVE THE DELIVERY CAPABILITY OF EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY A WEEK. DEPRIVATION BEGETTING EVERY WEEK NOT NOT TEN THOUSAND AND IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT AND I THINK OUR GOVERNOR NEEDS TO TALK WITH THE PRESIDENT FIX THAT. SO BECAUSE THAT WOULD HELP THAT BOTTLE NECK AND THEN THAT WOULD NOT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HEAR THAT ANYMORE THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DELIVER BUTWE DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE. SO I CAN MOVE ON TO MY SECOND QUESTION REALLY QUICK- SO YOU KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. TRYING TO UTILIZE THE COMMUNITY BASED AGENCIES IS THAT A STATE AGENCY- STATE DECISION OR A COUNTY DECISION ON WHICH AGENCIES GET UTILIZED AND I WAS AND I SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY I TALK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF GETTING ALL OF THEIR TEACHERS PRETTY MUCH VACCINATED WITHIN TWO DAYS. AND YET. THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL IN ORDER TO HAVE THE TEACHERS. HAVE ACCESS TO GETTING VACCINATED BECAUSE THAT ALLEVIATE. THAT THAT ONE OF THOSE ISSUES. COOLEY AND IS CURRENTLY FOR THE STATE OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE A COMBINATION- IT'S OF BOTH WORKING WITH AGENCIES I HAVE SAVED STATEWIDE SO FOR THE SCHOOLS SCHOOLS SCHOOLS AS IT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE. AND THEN ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT'S HOW WE'VE BEEN PRIMARILY. DEALING WITH OUT OF THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL GETTING GETTING IN COURT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I WOULD SAY THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER REALLY HITS THE ROAD- IT REALLY YOU REALLY NEED TO HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO REALLY BE ABLE TO BE EFFECTIVE- ACROSS THE STATE SO YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH. LOCAL LOCAL- POLICYMAKERS ELECTED OFFICIALS- AND GOVERNMENT TO REALLY BE EFFECTIVE- IF IT CAN'T BE IT CAN'T BE JUST AT THE STATE AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE- THAT THE LOCALS ARE REALLY CLOSE TO CLOSER TO WHERE EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING. RIGHT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND THAT'S WHY I THINK. AS YOU CAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER HAD TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS AND WE KNOW OUR OUR COMMUNITY'S BEST. AND WE REALLY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW THESE THINGS WORK- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE I THINK THERE ARE GOOD IDEAS OUT THERE. TO BE ABLE TO- MAXIMIZE DISTRIBUTION AND GET IT OUT BECAUSE THE MOST EQUITABLE THING TO HAPPEN IS FOR A 100% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WANT A VACCINE. TO GET IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE OTHER PROFESSION BURKE I WOULD I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON AS THE BLUE SHIELD PLAN- IS IT AND IF YOU WERE LISTENING TO OUR FIRST PANEL OF BOTH OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH YELLOW COUNTY ANTRIM L. A. COUNTY DID SHARE THAT THEY STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR ROLE IS GOING TO CHANGE WHEN THAT. IS IMPLEMENTED AND- I THINK THAT CONFUSION AND FRANKLY I THINK THE MAIN VARIETY IS CONSISTENT WITH FEEDBACK I'VE HEARD FROM MY COUNTY AS WELL ON THURSDAY AUGUST DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU THAT THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE WHAT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN- AND B. WHAT IS OUR CMMUNICATION PLAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTIES UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND THAT WE CAN MAKE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION AND NOT LOSE. FIVE NOT LOSE ANY TIME. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION AGAIN THIS IS MARK AGREED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. SO WE ARE ACTUALLY JUST FINALISING OUR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WITH BLUE SHIELD AND WORKING OUT SOME OF THOSE OPERATIONAL DETAILS THAT WE CRAVE IN THE COUNTIES CREDIT SO. CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE CONFUSION AS WE TRY TO FINALIZE THOSE DETAILS WE HAVE STARTED A WEEKLY STEERING COMMITTEE WITH COUNTY LEADERSHIP WILL MEET ON A WEEKLY BASIS ON TICKETS FOR ALL THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS. IN ADDITION WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY METHODICAL APPROACH TO ONBOARDING COUNTIES IN THREE DISTINCT WAVES AND MEETING DIRECTLY WITH THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERSHIP. I'M QUESTIONS GETTING ADVICE ON NETWORK CONSTRUCTION PROCESS INTEGRATION WITH MY TURN AND ALL OF THE VARIOUS DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED. OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSITION IS NOT. GOT IT AND- I WILL SAY WE'VE ALSO AND IN A THINK THAT THE SUBJECT IS EVEN COME UP HERE- WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT. OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND ESCAPE SEES WHO REALLY DO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS TRUSTED PROVIDERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND- OUR PLAY A PARTICULARLY CRITICAL ROLE FOR COMMUNITIES WHERE THAT ARE HARDEST TO REACH AND ASMARA'S. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THEY ARE REALLY WORRIED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO KIND OF GET LEFT IN THE DUST- AS AS WE MAKE THIS TRANSITION I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S YOUR INTENTION. TO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT WE ARE DOING TO. ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. ABSOLUTELY FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS COMMUNITY CLINIC THE VERY IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING INDIVIDUALLY IN EACH COUNTY. TO ON BOARD THOSE THAT CAN INTEGRATE WITH OUR SYSTEM AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO HELP THEM GET ON BOARD. OKAY AND WHEN SHOULD WE EXPECT THIS TO BE HAPPENING SO I KNOW YOU SAID THE FIND THE CONTRACT GONNA GET FINALIZED ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. FIVE FIFTEEN AND THEN WHAT WHAT HAPPENS FROM THERE WHETHER IT'S THE MILESTONES THAT WE CAN- APPOINT. POINT ARE COUNTIES TWO AND POINT HER COLLEAGUES TO IN TERMS OF THAT RAMP UP STRATEGY. CERTAINLY SO THERE'S GONNA BE THREE WAVES THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT TWO WEEKS EACH THEY'RE GONNA START NEXT WEEK WHEN WE FINALIZE THE CONTRACT WE HAVE A LIST OF COUNTIES WHICH WE CAN. PROVIDE IN A TENTATIVE FORM OF WHICH COUNTIES WILL BE WAKING pTHINKING ABOUT THE COUNTY- TO BRING ON FIRST WE REALLY LOOKED CLOSELY AT THOSE THAT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS OF COVERED NINETEEN. AND BRINGING THEM ONLINE TO GET- VACCINES DELIVERED EQUITABLY FASTER. AND SO OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD- ONBOARD THE FIRST WAVE AND THEN WE WILL GO TO THE SECOND WAVE AND THEN TO THE THIRD WAVE. SO THAT BY THE MIDDLE TO END OF MARCH ALL FIFTY AND WILL BE ABLE. GRABS GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL I'M AND- A- QUESTION RELATED ALSO TO THE COUNTIES BUT- SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY TO MY TURN I THINK WITH WITH WITH MY TURN AND I THINK WITH THINGS- BUT THIS TRANSITION MORE BROADLY. FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL THERE IS A CONCERN THAT WE'RE GONNA KIND OF THREW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER. AND RATHER THAN BUILD ON THEIR SUCCESS KIND OF START FROM SCRATCH. AGAIN HOW ARE WE GOING TO ENSURE THAT. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. SO GONNA WORK WITH OKAY PARTNER TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE STATE WIDE DATA SYSTEM. I WILL ADMIT I AM NOT THE EXPERT MY TURNED ITSELF WE WANT TO DELIVER THE DETAILS OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS I REMEMBER CALLING TO GET UP. BUT WE WILL WE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO BUILD ON THEIR SUCCESSES BUT WE- DO WANT TO BE CLEAR WE DO NEED TO INTEGRATE ALL OF THE DATA SYSTEMS INTO A SINGLE DATE. STATE STATEWIDE DATA STREAM SO WE CAN HAVE THAT LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY. AGAINST OUR SUCCESS AND DELIVERING VACCINES SO THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT THE PUBLIC CAN SEE WHERE VACCINES ARE FROM THE MOMENT THEY HAD TO THE STATE UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY ENTERED SOMEBODY'S CAR. WE KNOW. EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE TAX. GREAT AND I DO I DO THINK THAT THAT MAKES EMINENT SENSE- I CERTAINLY WANT TO BE FOCUSED. LOOKING FORWARD AND FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS- I THINK IT REALLY REALLY WOULD'VE BEEN. INCREDIBLY HELPFUL IF WE- HAD. THOUGHT THROUGH THE FACT THAT WE WERE GOING TO NEED THIS STATE WIDE. DATA SYSTEM. BACK IN AUGUST SO THAT WE COULD HAVE. BEEN DOING THIS WORK. AND ONBOARDING COUNTIES AS WE WERE BEGINNING TO START ROLLING OUT THE VACCINE. MANY COUNTIES INCLUDING MINE OF INVESTED TREMENDOUS TIME. EFFORT AND RESOURCES. IN CREATING THEIR OWN DATA SYSTEM FROM SCRATCH BECAUSE THEY WERE. THEY WERE TOLD. THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO PURSUE A STATEWIDE SOLUTION. I'M SO I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY. A LEARNING. THAT- I THINK COULD BE TAKEN. FOR NEXT TIME. AT WITH THAT ABBASI O FURTHER NUMBER QUESTIONS I BELIEVE WE'RE READY TO WORK ALL TRANSITION TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ THANK YOU JUST A NUMBER PRETTY MUCH COMING TOWARDS AND THE TIME BUDGET AFTER A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST WANT TO TALK TO KIND OF BACK TO THE T. PAY WITH BLUE SHIELD I KNOW I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT FINALISING NOT BY THIS FRIDAY IS THAT CORRECT. IS THERE A TIME PHARMATECH THE CONTRACT WITH THE BANK SHOWED. ME THAT CONTRACT WILL BE FINALIZED BY THE FIFTEENTH. OKAY REQUEST REGARDING THAT ON A VERY GOOD ANSWER ON THE TOP OF IT IN MY OPENING REMARKS PARTNERSHIPS AND I THINK- DOCTOR ARE GOING YOU TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW BEING INCLUSIVE AND HEARING EVERYBODY'S- IMPORTANT HOW WEAK AND- HELP. DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT. SO IS THERE ANY THOUGHTS TO WORKING MORE WITH OUR FIRE SERVICE OR EMS PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND IF SO IS THERE A AVENUE FOR THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THEIR SERVICES. THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK- I THINK IT'S GONNA DEPEND I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO. WORK AS A AS A PROVIDER IN THE WEIGHT OF THE WEIGHT MARTIN GREEN JUST DESCRIBED IT- I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK ONCE BLUESHIELD THAT ONE CITY PA IS UP AND RUNNING. BUT I'M SURE I'M SURE AS WE GET LOTS OF VACCINES AND THEY IF THEY QUALIFY THEY'RE ABLE TO I DON'T SEE WHY NOT BUT THAT'S I CAN'T I CAN'T ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY IT AT THIS POINT. OKAY IN ANOTHER ONE REGARDING THE BLUE SHIELD- HOPEFULLY SOMEONE HAVE A QUICK ANSWER TO THIS AND DOES ANYBODY KNOW. HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE BROUGH SHOWED A DEMO FAR. PROVIDERS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO VACCINATE FOLKS BECAUSE I YOU KNOW THE STATE DOING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FOLKS WHO NORMALLY DON'T- GIVE ACTIONS ARE DOING IT JUST TO. HELP OUT- GET MORE FOLKS VACCINATED- SO IS THERE A PLAN IN PLACE BECAUSE AS MORE. FACTIONS STARTED COME AVAILABLE WE'RE GONNA NEED FOLKS MORE FOLKS OUT THERE SO THEIR TIME FRAME. THAT WE KNOW BLUE SHIELD WILL HAVE. A DINNER PARTY FOLKS TO WILL BE. ABLE TO HELP DISTRIBUTIVE ACTION. YES I'LL JUST .COM I'LL JUST REPEAT WHAT MY COLLEAGUE. MS GREEN. ARE LAID OUT SO. THAT WE WILL. BLUESHIELD WILL START THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY NEXT WEEK AND WILL BE FINISHED BY MID MARCH IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING. THE PROVIDERS- THAT CAN BE IN THE NETWORK. OKAY- JUST SO YOU KNOW JUST A QUICK QUESTION WHAT CRITERIA WERE USED TO EVALUATE WHETHER PROVIDERS APPROVED TO BE IN THE NETWORK. ALL I SO WE'RE STILL FINALIZING THE CONTRACT WITH THE CRITERIA THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING AT THIS TIME IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE WELL POSITIONED TO BE DIRECTLY PEOPLE'S. WHETHER THEY CAN MEET OUR DATA INTEGRATION GOALS. AND HOW THE PERFORMED AGAINST BOTH ADVOCACY AND SPEED AND- OFFICIALS SIX. CAN GET AND SO THERE'S A KIND OF THAT THE TEARS BUT EQUITY BEING NORTHSTAR. IN JUST A THREE ONE NINE DEPARTING I GUESS MY FOR PARTING THOUGHTS BEFORE TRANSITION TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND I. WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY AND- FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE AND ARE DOING RIGHT NOW TO HELP OUR STATE.

GET TO WORK REBUILDING CALIFORNIA WE ARE WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU IN YOUR TEENS- IF I COULD LEAVE YOU I GUESS WITH. THEY MIGHT THREE BIG PICTURE REQUESTS AND I FIGURED SOME OF THESE AS WE WENT BUT I THINK NUMBER ONE REALLY IS. SETTING CLEAR AND ACHIEVABLE GOALS- FOR THE PUBLIC AND- AT FOR OUR PARTNERS- NUMBER TWO IS LET'S NOT CHANGE THE CRITERIA AND LET'S NOT CHANGE THE PLAN UNLESS THERE'S A REALLY REALLY COMPELLING REASON TO DO SO. BECAUSE CHANGE CREATES CONFUSION AND IT IT IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE. WE'RE NOT MAKING GRANTED DECISIONS AND THEN THIRD I WOULD I WOULD REQUEST IMPROVE COMMUNICATION WITH OUR COUNTIES AND WITH OTHER PARTNERS I KNOW THAT THINGS ARE MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST- BUT WE GOTTA BRING THEM ALONG ALONG WITH US.
