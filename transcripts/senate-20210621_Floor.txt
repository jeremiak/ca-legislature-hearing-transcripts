SENATE RESOLUTION THIRTY NINE BY SENATOR EDMUND RELATIVE TO LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER AND QUEER LGBTQ PLUS PRIDE MONTH THANK YOU SENATOR WHEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS- TODAY I RISE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE L. G. B. T. CARCASS TO PRESENT SENATE RESOLUTION THIRTY NINE WHICH RESIDENTS. WHICH RECOGNIZES JUNE TWO THOUSAND ONE AS LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH HAS MANY OF US KNOW PRIDE WAS INSPIRED BY UPRISING AT THE STONEWALL INN IN JUNE. OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND IT'S PARKED A LIBERATION MOVEMENT. A CALL TO ACTION THAT CONTINUES TO INSPIRE US ALL TO LIVE TO OUR NATION'S PROMISE. OF EQUALITY LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. IT IS AN OPPORTUNE TO REFLECT ON THE TRIALS. OF LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY HAS FACED AND TO REJOICE IN THE TRIUMPHS OF TRAILBLAZING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BRAVELY FOUGHT. AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR FULL EQUALITY. OUR COMMUNITY HAS. ACHIEVED REMARKABLE PROGRESS SINCE STONEWALL LANDMARK SUPREME COURT RULINGS HAVE STRUCK DOWN DISCRIMINATORY LAWS PROCLAIM MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND ESTABLISH WORKPLACE FOR. SECTIONS FOR LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. WE KNOW UP AND DOWN- THE STATE THERE HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT TO FLY FLAGS OVER CITY HALL'S AND STILL WE HEAR OUTRAGE AND STILL WE HEAR PUSHBACK ON FROM THESE BASIC THINGS OF FLYING THE PRIDE FLAG. WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY STATES IN WHICH LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS STILL FACE FUNDAMENTAL LACK THE PROTECTIONS IN HEALTHCARE EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER PUBLIC CON **** ACCOMMODATIONS. OUR NATION CONTINUES TO WITNESS A TRAGIC SPIKE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDER AND WOMEN OF COLOR AND OTHER GIANT GENDER DIVERSE PEOPLE. WE CANNOT FORGET THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DECEIVED DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN AND MANY OF US HAVE SUFFERED FROM FOOD INSECURITY POVERTY AND INADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. WE CANNOT FORGET THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY ARE BLACK AND LATINO LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST. RIGHT MONTH WE WILL CELEBRATE. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR EQUITY EQUITABLE RECOVERY FOR COMMUNITIES CARE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT. IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALING. WHO HAVE A BAG HERE FOR YOU MEMBERS THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SHARE GIFTS FROM THAT THE CAUCUS AND THERE'S A QVC CODE ON THE OUTSIDE SO YOU CAN BE ABLE TO WATCH OUR CEREMONY OF. OUR AWARDEES WHICH WILL BE DONE LATER ON THIS WEEK AND RESPECT OUT OF COVERT WE STILL WANNA. RECOGNIZE THE- DAY CONTRIBUTIONS OF CALIFORNIANS OF THE L. G. B. TO COOK QUESTION PLUS COMMUNITY. AROUND THE STATE- AS WE CONTINUE TO CONDONE INTOLERANCE AND- AND FIGHT AGAINST INJUSTICE. I ALWAYS REFLECT ON ON THE PRIDE MONTH AND- THE RAINBOW FLAG AND WHAT THAT SYMBOLIZES. WHEN THE MOVEMENT FOR STARTED NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THERE WASN'T ONE SYMBOL THAT KIND OF UNIFIED WHAT WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT. AND AS FOR ANY MOVEMENT WHEN YOU TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT A SYMBOL WILL BE THAT WILL RALLY PEOPLE TOGETHER AND SUMMARIZE WHAT YOU'RE MOVING IS ABOUT. THEY WERE YOU KNOW SHOULD BE THE PINK TRIANGLE THAT WAS PUT ON PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE. SENT TO CAMPS DURING THE HOLOCAUST SHOULD BE THE LAN TO SAME SIGNAL. WHAT WHAT SHOULD IT BE. AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT GILBERT BAKER IN SAN FRANCISCO. I WAS LOOKING OUT AT THE CELEBRATION THAT JUST BEGUN AND JUST SAW THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW. OF EVERYBODY THAT WAS OUT THERE AND THE JOY AND THE CELEBRATION AND A PLACE TO BE WHERE THEY COULD BE. AND AT THAT MOMENT THAT THAT IS IT IT'S A RAINBOW REPRESENTING ALL THAT WE ARE. I REFLECT ON ALL OF US WHEN IT WHETHER WHETHER YOU GET YOUR- STRENGTH FROM WHEREVER YOU MAKE IT AT THAT. THE SERVICE IN IN IN MY CHURCH THIS WEEKEND WAS ABOUT JOB IN THE STYLE AND THE AND THE STORM AND HAVING FAITH THAT YOU GET THROUGH THAT KIND OF THING. AND FOR MANY OF US SEEING THAT RAINBOW FLAG WAS A SYMBOL THAT WE WERE WELCOME SOMEWHERE- THAT FLAG WAS COULD COME INTO EFFECT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AT THE YEAR I GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND I CAN TELL YOU GOING AROUND THE COUNTRY AS A YOUNG PERSON BEING. YOU KNOW IT WAS NOT OKAY TO BE OUT YOU WOULDN'T DID NOT FEEL WELCOMED OUT BUT IF YOU SAW A LITTLE RAINBOW IN A CORNER OF A STORE. YOU FELT LIKE THAT WAS A PLACE YOU COULD GO THAT YOU WOULD BE SAFE FOR A WHILE. JUST LIKE THE GREEN BOOK IN THE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE HAD. PRIDE BOOKS THAT YOU COULD GO AROUND PLACES THAT WERE FRIENDLY FOR PLACES THAT WERE COMFORTABLE. AND IF THERE WAS THAT LITTLE RAINBOW SYMBOL IT WAS LIKE A CODE YOU KNEW YOUR OKAY. AND THAT OUR OUR MOVEMENT HAS EVOLVED TO A PLACE. WHERE WE HANG THE FLAG BUT IT'S ABOVE CITY HALL AS IT TELLS US WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK IN THE CORNERS. IN THE ALLEYS FOR PLACES THAT WE MIGHT BE SAFE. THAT VERY GUN. AT THE VERY STREETS OF. TO SAYS THAT WE CAN. TOO AND NOW WE CAN CELEBRATE ALL OF OUR DIVERSITY. IN WHO WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT THIS PRIDE IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE RAINBOW CELEBRATES- AND I INVITE YOU TO JOIN WITH US. TONIGHT AT EIGHT PM. THE CAPITOL DOME JUST FOR THE SECOND TIME WILL BE LIT UP. WITH THE OLD WITH THE RAINBOW COLORS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME OUT AND WATCH THAT WE LOVE TO HAVE YOU AND AGAIN. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE Q. B. C. CODE AND- INTO. AN ACCEPTING OUR GIFTS AND THEN ALSO ADD ADD TO SEE OUR NOMINEES. SO S. R. THIRTY NINE AFFIRMS PRIDE MONTH. AS A CELEBRATION OF DIVERSITY DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE OF FULL. EQUALITY FOR LGBTQ PLUS FAMILIES LIKE MY OWN. AND AT THE PRESENT TIME- THERE. AT THE TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON THIS- MEASURE. THANK YOU SENATOR EDMUND SENATOR GONZALES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE LGBTQ CAUCUS AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE WHO EVERY DAY FIGHT FOR NOT JUST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITIES BUT ALL THE COMMUNITIES THEY HAPPEN TO BE OUR AMAZING INCREDIBLE COLLEAGUES OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY DO THIS INCREDIBLE WORK WE NEED TO CONTINUE SUPPORTING THEM. AND THEIR EFFORTS- BUT LIKE MYSELF AS A SENATOR FROM LONG BEACH ONE OF BUT HAS A VERY LARGE AND ROBUST LGBTQ COMMUNITY WE HAVE OUR OWN HARVEY MILK PARK- THAT IS THE CENTER OF CELEBRATION FOR MANY LOCAL LGBTQ LITERATE LEADERS AND EVERY DAY I AS OF NOW I WANT TO ENSURE THAT I'M FIGHTING FOR THEM THEIR VOICES THEIR CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES SO WE CAN CREATE BETTER- AND STRONGER GENERATIONS OF EQUALITY FOR ALL. I THINK YOU. THANK YOUS SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- HIGH RISE AS A AS A GAY MAN AS THE SENATOR WHO IS THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING- THE GREAT CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. HE'S ME AND SUPPORT OF SENATE RESOLUTION THIRTY NINE YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK OF THE RAINBOW THE WONDERFUL RAINBOW THE MASKS THAT PEOPLE WERE IN TODAY AND THE FLAG- I REMEMBER BACK TO WHEN I FIRST CAME OUT AS A GAY MAN IN NINETEEN NINETY- MANY YEARS AGO NOW AND I REMEMBER MY AUNT. WHO WAS AN OUT LESBIAN WHO CAME OUT IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN BEING LGBTQ IS STILL CLASSIFIED OFFICIALLY IS BEING- MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION- SHE GAVE ME A WOMAN'S HAND- CALLED THE PRIDE- FREEDOM RINGS THEY WERE THERE IT WAS LIKE A RAINBOW NECKLACE THAT WAS A THING BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY IT'S NOT REALLY A THING ANYMORE BUT IT WAS A TING BACK THEN AND SHE GAVE IT TO ME AND AS YOU SAID THIS IS A SYMBOL OF OUR COMMUNITY AND YOU SEE WHERE THIS. WITH PRIDE. AND I THINK BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY- WHEN THERE WAS NO. TREATMENT FOR HIV AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. WERE DYING ON MASS WITH VERY LITTLE ATTENTION. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THERE REALLY WERE ALMOST NO- CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTIONS NOTING THERE MAYBE THERE WAS ONE STAYED AT THE MOST- THAT IS CIVIL RIGHTS ON A FEW CITIES CALIFORNIA'S. CERTAINLY HAD NO PROTECTIONS. BY THAT POINT IN TIME- IT WAS STILL CATEGORICALLY ILLEGAL- TO BE IN A- LGBTQ PERSONS SERVING. IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY WAS A CRIME STILLS PRE DON'T ASK DON'T TELL WAS SIMPLY A CRIME. AND WE WERE REALLY- STRUGGLING AS A COMMUNITY AND I THINK OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. WHAT'S HAPPENED IN TERMS OF LAWS THA HAVE BEEN PASSED- PARTICULARLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND JUST SOCIETAL ATTITUDES TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY THE FACT THAT IN RECENT POINT MARRIAGE. EQUALITY THINGS ARE CHANGING BUT AS THINGS CHANGE WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT WE ARE SO NOT THERE YET. WE LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. AND SEE THAT THERE ARE. PEOPLE STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SAY LEGISLATORS POLITICIANS WHO ARE TRYING TO SCORE. POLITICAL POINTS ON THE BACKS OF TRANS CHILDREN. BY TRYING TO BAN THEM FROM PLAYING SPORTS BY TRYING TO BAN THEM FROM SEEKING HEALTH CARE. THIS IS A TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEIR POLITICIANS WHO THINK IT'S SO IT'S ACCEPTABLE SOMEHOW. TO TRY TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN. THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. IN OUR SOCIETY. BUT WE CONTINUED TO SEE HIV NOT UNDER CONTROL IN VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY-PARTICULARLY AMONG- IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH WHERE WE'VE NOT DONE. ENOUGH WE CONTINUE IN CALIFORNIA TO CRIMINALIZE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY- AND WE ARE AND THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TO DO THIS LEGISLATIVE WORK. SHOWS THAT EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT QUITE WHERE WE NEED TO BE. BUT WITH ALL OF THAT SAID I AM SO PROUD OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE MADE IN SOCIETY AND PARTICULARLY HERE. IN CALIFORNIA I'M SO PROUD OF LGBTQ CAUCUS. A GROWING CAUCUS OF MORE MORE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY FEEL COMFORTABLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND ARE ABLE TO GET ELECTED TO OFFICE NOT JUST IN THE AMAZING CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. BUT IN PLACES LIKE STOCKTON IN PLACES LIKE RIVERSIDE IN PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE. ALL PLACES ALL OVER THE STATE THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN VIEWED. AS LGBTQ EPICENTERS. BETTER STEPPING UP AND EMBRACING OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT FOR OUR COMMUNITY REALLY- WARMS MY HEART KNOWING THAT I AM SURROUNDED BY COLLEAGUES. WHO ARE SO SUPPORTIVE I ASKED FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU TO SEND A PAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATOR SAYS CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I AM HONORED TO RISE IN SOLIDARITY WITH LGBTQ CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF SR THIRTY NINE RECOGNIZING JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FIRST TWENTY POINT ONE AS LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH. THE LGBTQ CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION THROUGH THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY ARE CALIFORNIA'S AND AMERICA'S LEADERS ROLE MODELS AND VALUE COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF TODAY AND FUTURE. I'LL MAKE NOTE THAT IN OUR OWN CAUCUS THE VICE CHAIR OF R. EIGHTY I THOUGHT THIS IS ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE LGBTQ CAUCUS. AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS ALEX LEE WHO AND THE API CAUCUS WHO ALSO IDENTIFIES LGBTQ. WE HAVE MANY LEADERS IN THE API COMMUNITY WHO ARE ALSO IN THEIR FIGHTS L. G. B. T. Q.

WELL THE LGBT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVING. OUR STATE AND COUNTRY ALL THE BBQ PLUS PEOPLE ARE STILL FACING DISCRIMINATION IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY. INCLUDING THOSE WHO ALSO IDENTIFIED AS ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. A STUDY RELEASED IN TWENTY NINETEEN BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FOUNDATION FOUND THAT EIGHTY I. L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS USER AT HEIGHTENED RISK FOR DISCRIMINATION AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL. STUDY FOUND THAT ONLY PLUS YOU. COULD SAY THEY COULD DEFINITELY BE THEMSELVES AT HOME ONLY 29% SAID THEY COULD DEFINITELY BE THEMSELVES AT SCHOOL. ALTHOUGH MANY PUBLIC PRIDE CELEBRATIONS HAVE BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO THE COVERED PANDEMIC. ARE INCLUSIVE STATE MUST INCLUDE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE ADVANCEMENT OF EQUALITY FOR ALL LGBTQ PLUS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS NATION AND THIS WORLD- I KNOW THAT THIS MIGHT BE OF GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S POINTED OUT FORTUNATELY THIS FIGHTS CLEARLY- THANK AN ONGOING ONE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT OVER. AND ESPECIALLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND VOTE FOR SR THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND- MEMBERS HI STAND AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF SR THIRTY NINE. AND I WANTED TO NOTE THAT IT'S A FEEL PARTICULARLY PROUD OF CALIFORNIA UNDER GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAVING BEEN THE PERSON THAT REALLY. STOOD UP TO THE FOES OF GAY MARRIAGE BY INITIATING WEDDINGS AT SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL ON VALENTINE'S DAY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT YEAR AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CALIFORNIA VOTERS AFTER FIRST REJECTING THAT ACTION THEN APPROVING IT AND ALLOWING. LOVE TO REIGN SUPREME AND MARRIAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE EACH OTHER- IN THE LATE NINETIES I REMEMBER WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME OUT TO ME SHE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND A LITTLE BIT THERE AFTER. THERE WAS- IF SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER THE SHOW THE TELETUBBIES AND ONE OF THE KEY TELETUBBIES WAS TINKY WINKY THANK YOU WORKING WAS PURPLE. AND TAKE YOU WE KISSED ANTENNA ALL THE TELETUBBIES SAID TELEVISIONS IN THEIR BELLIES AND TINKY WINKY CENTER WAS SHAPED LIKE A TRIANGLE. THAT CAUSED A PROMINENT TELEVANGELIST COLD TO CALL TAKE YOU WE CAN GET. SO I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE SO CLEVER I WILL I GIVE MY DAUGHTER FOR YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT HOLIDAY WAS. THAT YEAR I GAVE BIRTH THEY TOLD. THE LOOKED TO ME TO MOM I DON'T PLAY WITH TOY. THOUGH MICHAEL. WHAT IS IT. SO YOU KNOW THIS SIMPLE AND SHE'S LIKE OH. SO IT'S JUST A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW THE GENERATIONS CHANGE AND MY DAUGHTER AND HER WIFE JUST BROUGHT ME MY FIRST GRAND BABY- SO I'M VERY THRILLED ABOUT THAT. BUT NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE WHICH IS THAT. AS MANY STRIDES WE'VE MADE AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLE WE HAVE SO MANY ELECTED LGBTQ PEOPLE WE'VE GOT STEPHANIE BYERS SHE'S THE FIRST OPENLY TRANS NATIVE AMERICAN ELECTED TO STATE HOUSE. WE HAVE A- GUEST I DON'T WANT TO NAME SO MANY BECAUSE IN OUR IN OUR LEGISLATURE IN THE SENATE IN THE U. S. IN THE CONGRESS IN EVERY STATE HOUSE. SO IT'S INCREDIBLE BUT HOMOPHOBIA STILL REIGNS. MARCH IN OUR COUNTRY. AND IT'S LIKE SO MANY THINGS IT'S MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST WOMEN AND I'M NOT TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE HOMOPHOBIA AGAINST GAY MEN WERE AGAINST EVEN- TRANSMISSION BUT WOMEN ARE THE TARGETS OF VIOLENCE. L. G B. T. WOMEN AT MUCH HIGHER RATES. AND FOUR AS A PERCENT AS COMPARED TO STRAIGHT WOMEN 44% OF LESBIANS EXPERIENCE RAPE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE OR STALKING COMPARED 235% OF STRAIGHT WOMEN. AND AMONGST THE TRANS COMMUNITY 90% OF TRANS WOMEN HAVE EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT ASSAULTS SO THERE IS MUCH WORK FOR US TO DO BUT AGAIN. I'M SO PROUD OF THE STRIDES THAT WE HAVE MADE. AND THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO HOPEFULLY NO ONE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT I DID WHICH I HAVE TALKED TO POINT TO THIS FLOOR WHERE I LEARNED ABOUT MY VERY FAMOUS AUNT. ELEANOR TENANT TEACH TENANT ONE OF THE FIRST TENNIS CHAMPIONS IN THE US WHO WAS OPENLY MORE OR LESS OPENLY OUT CONSIDERING THE TIMES THIS WAS THE TWENTIES THIRTIES AND FORTIES. AND I LEARNED ABOUT- BY READING A BOOK SHE WAS MY MATERNAL MY PATERNAL GRADIENT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HER. BUT I CONFRONTED MY FATHER IN THE CIVIL WE DON'T TALK ABOUT HER. LATER OF COURSE I LEARNED WHY BECAUSE SHE WAS GAY AND WHEN I READ HER OBITUARY IN THE LA TIMES IT DESCRIBED THAT SHE DIED WITH NO LIVING RELATIVES. SO HOPEFULLY WE ARE PAST THAT POINT AND THAT'S WHAT OUR QUEST IS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO RESOLUTIONS LIKE THIS TODAY AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO CELEBRATE PRIDE RUN. AND THANK YOU. THE YOU TO SET ARCHULETA. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO SHARE THE MILITARY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR SENATE RESOLUTION THIRTY NINE WHICH PROCLAIMS JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS LGBTQPLUS pTHAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE CULTURAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR LGBTQ COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY REFLECT WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE STRIVE TO BE AS A STATE AND AS A NATION. WHEN WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO RESPECT ONE ANOTHER AND TO RECOGNIZE THE COMMON GOOD AND ALL OF US WE MUST MEAN TO INCLUSIVELY TEACH THEM ABOUT EVERY MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY. NO MATTER WHERE THEY COME FROM. IT MEANS ACKNOWLEDGING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR GREAT STATE AND NATION THAT L. G. B. T. Q. COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE MADE IN EVERY FIELD OF ENDEAVOR THE ARTS AND SCIENCES YEAH DANA. PUBLIC POLICY AND THE ARMED SERVICES IT WASN'T UNTIL TWENTY ELEVEN THAT OPENLY GAY LESBIAN BISEXUAL MEN AND WOMEN. WHO WERE PERMITTED TO SERVE IN THE MILITARY AND SINCE THEN THEY HAVE LED THE WAY IN OPENING DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY WHO THEY COME ACROSS AND SERVING WITH HONOR PRIDE AND DIGNITY. IN EVERY UNIT DEPARTMENT OF BRANCH MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY HAVE EXCELLED. AND THEY MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED FOR THEIR COURAGE PRIDE AND LEADERSHIP. AND THE KNOWLEDGE IN WHERE WE HAVE ADVANCED AND FURTHER PROMOTED THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL WE MUST ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SHORTCOMINGS BECAUSE THE WORK MUST CONTINUE ON. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO IN A READY KATIE THE PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION OF OUR LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY AND THEIR MEMBERS AND TO THAT END. WHERE EVER THERE IS A WAY TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE TO BE QUALITY OUR WORK ABSOLUTELY MUST CONTINUE. WHETHER IT IS EQUALITY IN OUR WORKPLACES FOR MARRIAGE AND BENEFITS RIGHTS TO SAME SEX COUPLES OR ALLOWING OUR LGBTQ PLUS MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS TO PROTECT OUR STATE OUR NATION OPENLY WITH PRIDE WE MUST CONTINUE TO ADVANCE. THE CAUSE OF EQUALITY BECAUSE WE- WE QUALITY AS MUCH IN OUR FUTURE TO OUR GENERATION AS WE DO TO THOSE IN THE PRESIDENT WHO LOOK TO OUR LEGISLATION OUR SENATE. US HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO SUPPORT EVERYONE EQUALLY AND FAIRLY I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM STOCKTON FOR INTRODUCING SR THIRTY NINE RESPECTIVELY AFTER I VOTE. AND TO THOSE WHO SERVED AND THOSE ARE CONTINUING TO SERVE A JOB WELL DONE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY THIRTY NINE WHICH DECLARED THE MONTH OF JUNE IS LGBTQ PRIDE. MARSHA P. JOHNSON ONE OF THE GAY ACTIVIST CREDITED FOR PUSHING BACK AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AGAINST THE NEW YORK GAY COMMUNITY WHICH SPARKED THE STONEWALL RIOTS ONCE SAID. HOW MANY YEARS HAS IT TAKEN PEOPLE TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND HUMAN BEINGS IN THE HUMAN RACE. SADLY WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION ACCORDING TO DATA BY THE F. B. I. HATE CRIMES AGAINST SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THE THIRD LARGEST CATEGORY AFTER RACE AND RELIGION EVEN HERE IN THE PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY FINDS ITSELF THE TARGET OF HATEFUL BIGOTED RHETORIC AND ACTIONS TO THIS VERY DAY. I'D LIKE TO SHARE A RECENT EVENT THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT KING SOOPERS CITY COUNCILMEMBER JOEL HURTADO PROPOSED A VERY SIMILAR RESOLUTION TO DECLARE JUNE AS PRIDE MONTH AND RAISE THE PRIDE FLAG AT CITY HALL. DURING THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE HATE GROUP KNOWN AS PROUD BOYS DESCENDED UPON THE KINGSBURG CITY HALL FOR MORE THAN FOUR HOURS OF PUBLIC COMMENT. SADLY MOST TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE RED TO THE RESOLUTION AND THE SAME VILE AND HATEFUL WORDS MANY OF THEM USING RELIGIOUS REFERENCES. DESPITE THE HEARTFELT PLEAS FOR SUPPORT IN THE ADVOCACY OF COUNCIL MEMBER TO. COUNCILMEMBER HER TADO PROPONENTS OF THE RESOLUTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY OUTNUMBERED AND IT FAILED TO PASS IT IT EVEN FAILED TO GET A SECOND BITE FROM A FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBER. THIS IS WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY BY DECLARING JUNE AS PRIDE MONTH WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE LGBTQ PLUS MEMBERS OF OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. LIKE COUNCILMEMBER HER TITLE. THAT YOU ARE LOVED YOU ARE SUPPORTED AND WE VALUE YOU WE MUST LIFT UP AND CELEBRATE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND EDUCATE OTHERS THAT IT'S OK TO BREAK NORMS AND BE WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE ARE A STRONGER PERSON. FOR DOING SO I WENT I THINK GOOD CALL FROM STOCKTON FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR EARLIER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT I THINK FOR MANY OF US THAT ARRIVED HERE IN THE SENATE. ARE WE NEVER THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PART OF HISTORY OR THAT SOMETHING WE DID AS AN INDIVIDUAL. WORLD BE SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF A LARGER MOVEMENT WE THINK IT JUST MIGHT BE A DIFFICULT SITUATION THAT WE FACED OURSELVES AND MANY TIMES ALONE. AND MADE A DECISION IN THAT CONTEXT THAT REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE IN ADDED WITH OTHERS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THINGS. IN TO BUILD ON WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER. AS ONE OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHEN I GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE IT WAS ILLEGAL TO BE GAY IN ALL FIFTY STATES. ILLEGAL YOU COULD BE ARRESTED OR CITED IN ALL FIFTY STATES MUCH LESS JOB PROTECTIONS. OR ANYTHING ELSE AND- IT'S BEEN INTERESTING THAT MANY SENATORS HAVE REFERENCE TO STONEWALL INCIDENT AND YET IT WAS NOT DOCTORS NOT LAWYERS IT WAS NOT ELECTED OFFICIALS IT WAS REALLY RANK AND FILE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T THINK THEY HAD MUCH TO LOSE. THAT SORT OF STARTED DOWN THE STREET OF STANDING UP AND CHANGING THINGS. AND YOU KNOW I WAS A JUST BECOME A COUNTY EMPLOYEE. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BECAME THE FIRST COUNTY IN THE UNITED STATES TO BAN DISCRIMINATION AMONG ITS EMPLOYEES ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN THEY DID THAT THAT WAS A REMARKABLE. FEELING OF FREEDOM OF NOT LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER A FEELING YOU COULD BE CLEAR ABOUT BEING YOURSELF. AND WHEN THE FIRST MARCHES IN MY HOME TOWN HAPPENED IN THOSE YEARS. WE HAD MORE DEMONSTRATORS THAN WE HAD MARCHERS WE HAD TO HIRE PRIVATE POLICE OFFICERS TO MARCH WITH US FOR OUR SAFETY JUST MARCHING IN PUBLIC. DOWN THE STREET. IN IN ROOM. IN THIS ROOM. WAS A DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT REMOVED THE SODOMY LAW FROM CALIFORNIA WAS DEADLOCKED HERE TWENTY TO TWENTY. BUT DEADLOCK HAD TO BE HELD FOR HOURS FOR THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO FLY IN FROM OUT OF STATE TO CAST THE TIE VOTE. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND FOR THOSE OF US THAT LIVED THROUGH. THE AIDS CRISIS THERE CERTAIN PARTS OF IT THAT WERE REALLY PUBLIC BUT AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF AN AIDS AGENCY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE EPIDEMIC BEFORE THE DRUG COCKTAIL THERE WERE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES THAT HAPPENED WITH IT I CAN'T TELL YOU THE TIMES. THAT A FAMILY THAT WAS A STRANGE WOULD SWOOP INTO TOWN AND SWEEP UP HALF OF A HOUSE OR WOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND DENIED VISITING RIGHTS TO THE SPOUSE IN THE LAST DAYS OF SOMEBODY'S LIFE. JUST BECAUSE THE RIGHTS MARK WHO RECOGNIZED HIM I THINK THAT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE BIG DEBATES. ABOUT INCREMENTAL CHANGE AND WHAT TO DO WHEN THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THE SUPREME COURT ACTED IN VERMONT. AND SAID THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE DOMESTIC PARTNERS BENEFITS BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THE QUALITY. AND VERMONT LEGISLATORS EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UNDER ORDER FROM THE SUPREME COURT LOST THEIR SEATS IN THE NEXT ELECTION FOR VOTING FOR THAT. AND WITHIN A MATTER OF YEARS DOMESTIC PARTNERS BECAME THE CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT. WITH REGARD TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND SO IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY BE CLEAR. STANDUP AND I THINK IT IS EVERYBODY THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CADRE OF PEOPLE THAT STOOD UP AT THE BEGINNING OR ALONG THE WAY OR CLEAR. BUT IT WAS TOO MANY PEOPLE AND WE SAW THE BROAD SUPPORT IN THIS ROOM. THAT IS REALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE AND- IT IS NOW I SPENT. TWO THE EXTENT OF DAYS THIS WEEKEND. IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY DOING SEVENTEEN THINGS NOW THAT WE CAN DO THINGS AND I WENT TO THE GROVER BEACH CITY HALL. AND SAW THE PRIDE FLAG I WENT TO THE- GROW GRANDET CITY HALL AND SAW THE PRIDE FLAG. BUT I WENT TO THE GALA DIVERSITY CENTER IN DOWNTOWN SAN LUIS OBISPO. IT HAD ITS SIGN DEFACED AND DESTROYED JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. AND STOOD WITH THEM. TO LET THEM KNOW. THAT THEY WERE NOT ALONE. AND THAT IS ALL STILL THE EBATE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW SO THIS RESOLUTION IS IMPORTANT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSTANTLY. PUTA STAKE IN THE GROUND TO SAY WERE THERE WITH COME A LONG WAY BUT WE STILL HAVE THINGS TO DO SO HARD PROBABLY ASKED FOR AND ONLY FOCUS. ON SR THIRTY NORTH THANK YOU SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AS PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK THE L. G. B. T. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD- LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SR THIRTY NINE. WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY CELEBRATION OF THE GREAT PROGRESS THAT WE HAVE MADE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THIS STATE. PROGRESS THAT WE EVEN SEE AN ORANGE COUNTY OF ALL PLACES THE LGBT CENTER OF ORANGE COUNTY JUST CELEBRATED ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. CITIES LIKE IRVINE ANAHEIM COSTA MESA AND LAGUNA BEACH AND YES EVEN HUNTINGTON BEACH ARE NOW FLYIN THE PRIDE FLAG IN CELEBRATION OF THIS MONTH SO YES PROGRESS IS HAPPENING YES IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL AND EXCITING AND I'M PROUD TO STAND AS AN ALLY WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY. AS A MEMBER OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CAUCUS BUT ALSO JUST AS SOMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE THAT MY KIDS ARE GONNA GROW UP IN. BUT LET'S MAKE NO MISTAKE WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THERE ARE THOSE WHO WANT TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON PROGRESS THERE DOES THAT WE SEEK TO DIVIDE US BASED ON WHO WE ARE OR WHO WE LOVE. AND SO AS LEADERS IN THE STATE'S BODY LET US NOT FORGET OUR MISSION TO TRY TO UNITE PEOPLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT LOVE IS LOVE TO TRY TO DEFEND THE GAINS WE'VE MADE AGAINST THOSE WOULD TRIP WHO WOULD TRY TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK ON PROGRESS I URGE- I VOTE. ON SR THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AS CHAIR OF THE LATINO LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IT IS MY HONOR TO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SR THIRTY NINE I AM PROUD TO HAVE GROWN UP IN THE UNION THE HOSPITALITY FOOD SERVICE HOTEL WORKERS. CLEARLY ONE OF THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST PROGRESSIVE UNION ESPECIALLY ON LGBTQ RIGHTS THAT'S HOW I GREW UP IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT ALONGSIDE. MEMBERS LIKELY JONES. DURING PRIDE MONTH WE RECOGNIZE THE RESILIENCE AND THE DETERMINATION OF SOME IN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FOUGHT. AND CONTINUE FIGHTING TO SIMPLY LIVE THEIR LIVES REALLY AND AUTHENTICALLY. L. G. B. T. Q. LATINOS ARE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS ALSO AND EVERYTHING FROM ARTS AND POLITICS AND THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVEMENTS FROM THE FAMOUS MEXICAN PAINTER FRIDA KAHLO. TO JOSE JULIO SALARY OF THE FIRST OPENLY GAY CANDIDATE TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ALSO APPLAUD SYLVIA RIVERA FOUGHT FOR THE INCLUSION OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE INTO THE LARGER MOVEMENT FOR GAY RIGHTS. ND THEN WE FAST FORWARD AND WE HAD JUST RECENTLY THE HONORABLE JOHN BAD AS THE FIRST OPENLY GAY SPEAKER IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DICK. THE FIRST OPENLY GAY CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER OF OUR STATE AND LET'S NOT FORGET TO CELEBRATE OUR LEADER WHO HAS BEEN BOTH SPEAKER AND PRO TEM OF OUR SENATE SENATOR TONI ATKINS. THE PRIDE MONTH AS WE RECOGNIZE THIS PRIDE MONTH AS WE RECOGNIZE THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS OF LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS ACROSS OUR NATION. AS A CAUCUS WE REAFFIRM OUR FIGHT AGAINST ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND INJUSTICE. EVEN THOUGH HISTORIC SUPREME COURT RULINGS IN RECENT YEARS STRUCK DOWN. REGRESSIVE LAWS AND AFFIRM THE RIGHT TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN SECURED WORKPLACE FROM WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS FOR. INDIVIDUALS THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT EFFORTS TO ROLL. IN SOME STATES LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS STILL LACK PROTECTIONS FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WITNESS THE TRAGIC SPIKE IN VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDER WOMEN OF COLOR. AND YOUTH WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY RESTS AT RISK OF SELF HARM. I'M STILL HAUNTED AS MANY OF YOU ARE BY TRAGEDY SUCH AS THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING IN ORLANDO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR FORTY NINE PEOPLE WERE SENSELESSLY MURDERED AND FIFTY THREE INJURED. BECAUSE THEY ENJOY WE'RE TRYING TO ENJOY A NIGHT OUT. THE ONLY FAULT WAS DECIDING TO ATTEND A GATE NIGHTCLUB THAT EVENING. SO AS WE CELEBRATE LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH WE MUST ALL BE DILIGENT AND STEADFAST IN OUR COMMITMENT TO HELP AND VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT COMMUNITY. ALL COMMUNITIES SO WE CAN SURE JUST AND EQUITABLE AMERICA FOR ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I US SUPPORT SR THIRTY NINE THANK YOU SENATOR EXCEPTION- CALM WATER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS TO SUPPORT S. R. THIRTY NINE IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR LGBTQ BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU KNOW LAST WEEKEND I VISITED THE SITE OF THE COOPER DONATH RIOTS- IT HAPPENED ACTUALLY IN MY DISTRICT AND THE RIDES- WERE IT WAS A SMALL UPRISING IN RESPONSE. TO POLICE HARASSMENT OF L. G. B. T. Q. PEOPLE IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THAT WAS TEN YEARS BEFORE THE STONEWALL RIOTS AND THIS WAS DURING THE TIME OF MCCARTHYISM. ANTI COMMUNISM. AND THE BLACKLISTING WHEN IN FACT SO MANY LGBTQ MEN AND WOMEN WERE PUT ON THOSE LISTS BECAUSE THEY WERE DEEMED A SECURITY RISK BY THIS COUNTRY. THAT WAS THEN. AND I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE ANTI LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION DOESN'T EXIST THEY MIGHT THINK WE CAN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT OUR HISTORY OF MAKING LGBTQ FOLKS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS NOW WE CAN STOP HAVING OUR PARADES THAT WE CAN STOP WAVING OUR FLAGS. BUT I WOULD REMIND THOSE FOLKS THAT IT WAS ONLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WHEN VOTERS CONSIDERED PASSING THE BRIGGS INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD HAVE BANNED GAY TEACHERS FROM TEACHING IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IT WAS THAT NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN AIDS RAVAGED COMMUNITIES OF GAY BLACK MEN AND OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN'T EVEN TRACK THE NUMBER OF DEATHS. INSTEAD THEY CALLED IT THE GAME PLAY AND SINCE BLACK MEN WERE THE ONES DYING IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THEY NEEDED TO WORRY ABOUT. IT WAS ONLY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN YOUNG STUDENT MATTHEW SHEPARD. WAS TORTURED AND BEATEN AND LEFT TO DIE. AND IT WAS AS RECENT AS TWENTY THIRTEEN TO FOUR YEARS TOO LATE WHEN CALIFORNIANS FINALLY REALIZE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MARRY THE PERSON THEY LOVE AND WANT TO SPEND THEIR LIVES WITH. WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS SINCE THEN BUT THERE IS STILL WORK AHEAD IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN HOMICIDES OF OUR BLACK GAY AND LESBIAN TRANS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. AND OUR TRANS BLACK COMMUNITY IS THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE FROM POLICE. SO TODAY WE NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER. AND WE NEED TO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT. TO OUR LGBTQ BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO ARE FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR FRIENDS.

TO SEE SOME OF HER FRIENDS WHO ARE GAY AND HOW THEY WERE TREATED THE ONE THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST WAS A BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN IN HIGH SCHOOL AND- WHEN HE'S HE SPOKE THREE LANGUAGES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND WHEN HE CAME OUT TO HIS PARENTS THEY KICKED HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE AND THEY DIDN'T WELCOMING BACK INTO THEIR HOME FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO AT THAT TIME OUR DAUGHTERS WERE IN HIGH SCHOOL. THANKS INKLING THAT MAYBE- MAYBE JESSE WAS GAY AND SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE SHE FELT REALLY WELCOME AND KNEW THAT SHE COULD TELL HER PARENTS ANYTHING AND THAT WE WOULD ALWAYS LOVE HER SO SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND I THOUGHT I WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD JUST REALLY MAKE HER FEEL WELCOME WE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT IN OUR HOUSE YOU COULD DISAGREE WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THINGS MY HUSBAND I WANTED TO HEAR THEIR OPINIONS SO WE'RE HAVING ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I SAID YOU KNOW. THE ONLY THING THAT WILL GET YOU KICKED OUT OF THE LABOR FAMILY IS IF YOU HURT SMALL ANIMALS ARE YOU REGISTERED REPUBLICAN. SO LATE. WHEN OUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT TO US I SAID TO HER I SAID JESSE DID MY LITTLE TALK HELP YOU. AND SHE SAID. NO MOTHER SHE GOES I ALWAYS KNEW I COULD TELL YOU IN DOUBT. SO THAT MADE ME FEEL REALLY GOOD. BUT I JUST THINK THAT. PARENTS WHO HAVE GAY CHILDREN. SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THE DAY THEY COME OUT TO YOU. THEY'RE THE EXACT SAME PERSON. THEY WERE THE DAY BEFORE. LOVE IS LOVE MY DAUGHTER IS HAPPILY MARRIED TO HER WIFE. THEY HAVE A LITTLE BOY OUR GRANDSON NICO. AND THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN SEEING YOUR CHILDREN. GAY OR STRAIGHT. THRIVE IN LIFE THANK YOU AND I SUPPORT SR THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I ALSO WRITE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SR THIRTY NINE. AND I WANT TO THANK GOD MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO AND DISCUSSING YOU KNOW THE PARENT PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY PERSPECTIVE AS A TEACHER. JUST EXPERIENCING SOME STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH INTERNAL STRUGGLES AND HOW TO CONVEY. THEIR STORY TO THEIR OWN PARENTS SANDY AND IT IS. EXACTLY HOW THE GREAT CENTER FROM MARTINO STATED. THE CHILDREN DON'T CHANGE THE PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE THEIR THE SAME EXACT PERSON THAT YOU LOVED. BEFORE THEY CAME OUT TO YOU. BUT I DO WANT TO JUST RECOGNIZE ALL THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AS A SOCIETY AND ALSO. THANK ALL THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY HAVE MADE AND THERE'VE BEEN MANY. AND A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY'RE OVERLOOKED OR NOT HIGHLIGHTED IN IN THIS. PRIDE MONTH I THINK IT'S JUST APPROPRIATE THAT WE DO I DON'T WANT TO REITERATE WHAT APPLIES THE GREAT CENTER FROM LOS ANGELES STATED YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO OUR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WE GOT A LOT ON TO OUR PRO TEM AND SO MANY OTHERS. BUT I JUST WANT TO REMIND US THAT RESPECT SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENT TOLERANCE SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENT. AND SOLIDARITY WITH THESE COMMUNITIES SHOULD ALWAYS BE PRESENT NO MATTER WHAT THE MONDAY SO I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WITH LOVE RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND JUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE NEXT GENERATION. IS WATCHING CLOSELY AND WHAT WE DO MATTERS WHAT WE SAY MATTERS AND OUR ACTIONS MATTER AND TO ALL THOSE WATCHING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW. THAT WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR LGBTQ.

TODAY I'M STANDING AND ASKING US TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF THE BOUNDARY PUSHING COMEDIAN RICHARD PRYOR'S LONG TIME WRITING PARTNER AND MY CONSTITUENT PAUL MOONEY WHO DIED MAY NINETEENTH AT HIS HOME IN OAKLAND MOONEY WAS KNOWN FOR HIS BOLD AND INCISIVE COMMENTARY ON RACISM IN AMERICAN LIFE AND WAS ALSO A REAL HIGHLY RESPECTED STAND UP COMEDIAN. HE WROTE FOR AN APPEARED REGULARLY ON DAVE CHAPELLE CHAPELLE SHOW AND ONE OF HIS BEST KNOWN BITS ON THAT SHOW WAS ASKED A BLACK DUDE IN WHICH WHITE PEOPLE WOULD ASK DUMB QUESTIONS AND MOONEY WOULD RESPOND WITH HILARIOUS AND UNAPOLOGETICALLY DEFIANT ANSWERS IN ONE EPISODE A PERSON ASKED CAN BLACK MEN JUMP REALLY HIGH. ALL RIGHT YES BLACK PEOPLE CAN JUMP YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING FROM THE POLICE. WHEN HE WAS BORN IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE IN SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA HE MOVED TO OAKLAND CALIFORNIA WITH HIS FAMILY SEVEN YEARS LATER. HIS ORIGINAL LAST NAME WAS GLADNEY BUT HE CHANGED IT TO MONIQUE BECAUSE HIS GRANDMOTHER CALLED HIM THAT WHEN HE WAS A KID. HE WAS FOURTEEN WHEN HE AND HIS MOTHER MOVED TO BERKELEY. AND AT A LOCAL MOVIE THEATER HE WANTED DANCE CONTEST BECAUSE HE WAS DOING A STOMPING DANCE THAT INVOLVES SLAPPING AND PATTING THE BODY LIKE A DRUM THE HAM BONE. AND HE REALIZED HE LOVED THE APPLAUSE HE WORKED WITH PRIOR. FROM NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE HE WAS ALSO KNOWN FOR HIS COLLABORATIONS WITH RED FOX AND EDDIEMURPHY. END AS ONE OF THE WRITERS ONE HIT COMEDY SHOWS IN LIVING COLOR SANFORD AND SON AND GOOD TIMES. YOU MAY HAVE ALSO SEEN A FEW CULT CLASSICS INCLUDING RICHARD PRYOR SPILLS WHICH WAY IS UP. AND BUSTING LOOSE AND PAUL MOONEY PORTRAYED SINGER SONGWRITER SAM COOK IN THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY. HE CHRONICLED HIS PARTNERSHIP WITH PRIOR IN HIS TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN MEMOIR BLACK IS THE NEW WHITE. WELL HE IN PRIOR WE'RE OPPOSITES IN MANY WAYS MOONEY NEVER DRANK DRANK OR DID DRUGS. THEY SHARED A STRONG CONNECTION HOWEVER IN COMEDY ENDING CUT HARD EDGED COMEDY- I RECALLED GOING TO SEE ONE OF PAUL MOONEY STAND UP SHOWS. MAYBE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO IN BERKELEY AND AS I MENTIONED HE WAS KNOWN FOR VERY INCISIVE COMMENTARY THAT CONFRONTED RACISM I DON'T REMEMBER NOT LAUGHING MUCH AT THAT SHOW AND BEING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. I THEN SAW HIM AGAIN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO AT THE BERKELEY BLACK THEATER AND AT THAT SHOW AFTER OF COURSE WATCHING HIM ON THE SHIP HELLO SHOW AND ASK A BLACK DUDE AND SUCH. FIVE MUCH MORE APPRECIATED HIS COMEDY AND I WAS MUCH LESS UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGH HIS PURPOSE WAS TO MAKE ME SO. BUT IT DID MAKE ME THINK A GREAT DEAL. LATER GENERATIONS OF BLACK COMICS GRAVITATED TO MOONEY IN THE EIGHTIES HE OPENED FOR EDDIE MURPHY ON HIS ROCK SHOW. AND WHAT I WILL END WITH IS AFTER MOONEY'S DEATH DAVE CHAPELLE ON NPR'S MORNING EDITION CALLED MOONEY SIMPLY THE BEST THAT EVER WAS THANK YOU FOR JOINING IN HIS MEMORY. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN IN GERMAN- IN MMORY OF MR PAUL MUNI- INDIVIDUAL THAT I MET SOME. FORTY PLUS NOT PLUS FOR FORTY YEARS AGO- DOING STAND UP COMEDIAN OR COMEDY- LA AS A GERMAN LAST WEEK IN THE MEMORY OF FRED CALLAWAY I MENTIONED HIS FACILITY IN LA THAT'S LEGENDARY THE REGENCY WAS THAT FACILITY SERVED ASKED A BLACK COMEDY AT ACT THEATRE FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS WERE RISING STARS FROM ALL ACROSS THE STATE LET ALONE THE NATION CAME AND PERFORMED ROUTINES ON A REGULAR BASIS MR MOONEY WHO WAS ALREADY A STAR WOULD GRACE THE STAGE. PERIODICALLY AND HE WAS JUST AMAZING AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY SAID HE WAS UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT HIS COMEDY HE USED THE REALITIES OF RACE AS A PLATFORM TO. EDUCATE AND BRING FORTH LAUGHTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAKE FOLKS UNCOMFORTABLE AND MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE RACISM IN THE PREJUDICE THAT EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND AGAIN HE WAS UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT IT. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY STATED I'VE- WATCHED HIM PERFORM MANY NIGHTS FOR WHITE AUDIENCES WOULD WALK OUT. IN HIS ONLY RESPONSE WOULD BE I HOPE MY BLACK FRIENDS THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF ARE OUT THERE STILL IN YOUR CAR RIGHT NOW. AND BUT THAT WAS PAUL AND ONE OF HIS FUNNIEST ROUTINES AS MANY FOLKS MIGHT NOT KNOW WAS ONE OF THE LEGENDARY ONES ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE IF YOU REMEMBER SOME FORTY YEARS AGO. IT WAS RICHARD PRYOR. AND CHEVY CHASE DOING WORD ASSOCIATION HE WROTE THAT. SKIP IN ITS MEMORABLE IT'S MEMORIAL IT'S ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT SKITS ON SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE PAUL HAS ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKSHIRE WAS A- COMIC GENIUS. AND I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW HIM OVER THE YEARS AND AGAIN. WHAT YOU SAW WHAT PAUL MOONEY WAS WHAT YOU GOT AND HE HAD NO FILTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE SPOKE FROM HIS HEART HE SPOKE FROM THE REALITY OF THE WORLD THAT HE LIVED IN AS A BLACK MAN IN AMERICA ANY USE COMEDY TO HELP TELL THE STORY. OF THE RACISM AND DIVISION AND DISPARITIES THAT EXISTED SO I ASK THAT WE JOURNEY MEMORY OF A- GREAT CALIFORNIA GREAT AMERICAN AND A GREAT HUMANITARIAN THIS BALL MOANING.
