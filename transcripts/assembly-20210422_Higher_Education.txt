A. B. SEVEN FIVE SIX. MR ZURICH MISTERS ERIN WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE BEGIN WITH YOUR OPENING STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS BILL HEARD COLLEAGUES AB SEVEN FIFTY SIX IS A LABOR OF LOVE- THIS THIS THIS- THE CAL KIDS INVESTMENT THIS BILL IS THE CAL KIDS INVESTMENT ACT AND WOULD LEVY A 1% FEE ON A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT DOES BUSINESS. IN CALIFORNIA ON EACH LOAN ORIGINATED BY A PRIVATE PERSON. FOR THE PURPOSES OF FINANCING EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. THE FEE IS NON RECURRING SO IT DOES NOT APPLY ON THE LOAN ANNUALLY OR ON REPAYMENT. THE FEE IS SOLELY INTENDED TO BE PAID BY THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BOTH LEDGE COUNCIL AND BANKING COMMITTEE TO ENSURE OUR AMENDMENTS CLEARLY STATE THIS PROVISION. SO THAT THE COST IS NOT BORNE UPON- THE CURRENT HOLDERS OF THE DEBT AS THEY'RE TRYING TO FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION I WANTED TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE- AS THE CHAIR KNOWS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AREA NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WHETHER IT WAS A B. FIFTEEN OR A. B. THIRTY FOUR. THE IDEA AND THE CONCEPT IS TO HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERY CHILD BORN. WILL HAVE A FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT TO THEIR NAME. PLACED SO THAT BY THE TIME THEY'RE EIGHTEEN. THE FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNT WILL GROW TO A PLACE WHERE WOULD FINANCE THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ENHANCE THEIR CAREER PATHS. GIVEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THE COST OF EDUCATION COST OF COLLEGE TUITION- COST OF BEING ANY YOUNGER ADULTS BEING ABLE TO ADVANCE AND ENHANCE THEIR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES IT'S BECOMING ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING. FOR OUR CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS WHEN YOU LOOK AND SEE THAT- EDUCATION THAT INDUSTRY HAS OVER ONE POINT FIVE ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING DEBT IN THE UNITED STATES. AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION OF THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE IS NO RELIEF IN SIGHT. YET WE NEED TO COME UP STATE BY STATE WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO SEE HOW. OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL NOT CONTINUALLY BE BURDENED WITH A WHOLE MORTGAGE OF EDUCATIONAL LOANS BUT BE ABLE TO AT LEAST START WITH A MODICUM OF AN INVESTMENT. THAT WILL THEN HELP THEM- CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER AND NOT BE SADDLED WITH A SEVERE DEBT. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE THAT ONGOING REVENUE OF JUST ONE PERCENT. TOWARDS FUTURE EDUCATION- LOANS ONE TIME FEE SO THAT THAT FEEDING GOES INTO THE TRUST TO FINANCE THE CAL KIDS PROGRAM ON AN ONGOING BASIS- THIS GIRL AS I MENTIONED IS BEING HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IT'S GOING TO BE GOING NEXT TO BANKING. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BANKING COMMITTEE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN ADVANCE THIS WITHOUT HARMING FUTURE GENERATION OF YOUNG BORROWERS. WITH THAT I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE- IN IMPROVING THIS BILL AND WITH ME IS NIGH RENO HOW BAD YOUNG WHO IS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- FOR HER COMMENTS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU- TRINITARIAN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HAVING- PROBLEMS WITH THE TELEPHONE LINES AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. TAKE A BREAK. RECESS UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THE TELEPHONE LINES. AND HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T TAKE TOO LONG AND- S. U. MAYBE NOT TO GO TOO FAR BUT WE NEED TO TAKE A RECESS UNTIL THEY CAN GET THE TELEPHONE LINES FIX OKAY SO WITH THAT. WE'RE IN RECESS. THIS IS NICK WITH EIGHTEEN T. ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR. MY SOUNDCHECK.

SHARE AND THANK YOU TO US OWNERS ARE IN FOR OFFERING THIS IT'S- IT'S A FASCINATING- CHALLENGE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO ADDRESS I THINK THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IN IN THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE LEADING UP TO HERE YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT THERE'S- SOMETHING THERE FOR THEM- WHEN IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO GO TO COLLEGE. IS IT'S AN ADMIRABLE GOAL- WE NEED TO DO THIS AT THE BACK THE COST OF COLLEGE IS SKYROCKETING SO I FULLY SUPPORT THAT- THAT GOAL THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN WE NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING ON. HOW TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT IT ALSO RAISES. IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANT TO FUND THIS WHICH I THINK HAS HAS MANY PROBLEMS- IN THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS I THINK A LOT OF A LOT OF US RECORD RECOGNIZE THAT. ALSO ALERTS US AND REMINDS US ABOUT HOW WE FINANCE HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA SO. PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO PASTE. SOME OR ALL OF THE COSTS OTHERS ARE GIVEN GRANTS OR SCHOLARSHIPS. AND DIED IN THEIR LIVING EXPENSES WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AS WELL WE KNOW THAT CERTAINLY IS THE CASE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS BUT- FOR FINANCE- HIGHER READ. ALSO WITH PRIVATE BANKING DOLLARS REALLY- THAT THAT. MANY STUDENTS END UP- WITH THAT DATA SO THERE'S THE STATE RELATED AID THERE IS THE- PHILANTHROPIC AID THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW SEEKING.-AND THEN THERE IS THE BANKING MONEY- THAT- ISSUES ALSO RELY ON THE FUN- THAT THAT WHOLE HIGHER EDUCATION JOURNEY. E IF WE AD MORE STATE SUPPORT FOR WE WOULDN'T WE WOULDN'T NEED THEM TO DO SO HAVE ANY SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OR INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS- IS ONE WAY TO DO THAT BUT HOW WE FUNDED IS REALLY TRICKY AND THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY FOR PERHAPS NOT JUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFFLOAD THIS BOTH TO PRIVATE LENDERS AND THEN TO STUDENTS TO PAY THAT BACK- BUT TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY I MEAN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT STATE BANKS THINGS LIKE THAT BUT HOW ELSE CAN THE STATE FUND FUTURE. COSTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAN THE WAY THAT WE'RE DOING IT- SO YOU KNOW CONTINUE ON THIS JOURNEY WITH THIS BILL TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIND THIS FOR. FUTURE STUDENTS- BUT I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT A LOT OF US HAVE CONCERNS THAT THERE'S NO WAY. WE COULD ASK FOR A TAX ON BEING SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE PASSED ON. TO CURRENT BORROWERS- OF THAT MONEY OR TRYING TO GET THROUGH COLLEGE SO- A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STOP. ON THE LEGISLATIVE JOURNEY FOR THE BILL SO LET'S GIVE YOU SOME TIME TO WORK ON IT THANKS. THIS REVIEW THANK YOU. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND HONEST IN HIS AREA AND WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE THIS PARTICULAR BILL MY ONLY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT- THIS COSTS SOMEHOW GETS PASSED DOWN TO THE STUDENTS. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD ON IT AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT AND AS WE DISCUSSED I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT- BACK THE COST NOT BEING PASSED ON TO. STUDENTS BECAUSE AT THE END AND THAT THE. THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL SO THANK YOU AND I. YOU THIS BILL TO THE TO THE- THANK YOU. WITH YOUR JOINT. I THANK YOU- THE SEMINARS IN SO IS- OUT REMARKABLE- ALWAYS SAID WAS SAW MY INTEREST AS WELL HELLO- THE PARENTS SO WOULD TO PREPARE OR- THE NECESSARY COLLEGE OF FUN STUFF WITH YOUR CHILDREN AND I PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED MYSELF FOR- INCENTIVIZING. THE PARENTS OR EMPLOYERS TO MECCA- SCHOLARSHIP CONTRIBUTIONS SO FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDPARENTS ALL ENCORES AND SO QUIET DOG CONTRIBUTE DOES DAN OF THOSE AMOUNT NO COULD BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE- SO WAY OF- OF PROMISCUITY ENCOURAGING ESTABLISHING NECESSARY SCHOLARSHIPS THIS IS- I'M NOT UP TO ME IS SO UNIVERSAL- EVERY CHILD. AND- YES I ENDED UP TO IS TO AND FORM OF A TAX IF- FOR THE POOR STUDENTS TO HOST OFF PRIVATE THIS AND- YEAH. IN THE FRONT S. ONE HAVE TO PAY. 1% OF THE SOUL WOULD IT BE ADDITIONAL FEE TO THEM ALL. WHAT WILL IT BE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR- AMOUNT OF LOANS ARE THEY ARE AND- AS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE A SO THIS IS A TOTALLY TARIAN TYPE OF APPROACH AND- THIS IS MANDATING AND DOG. AFTER IF YOU IMPLEMENTED OUT FROM NOW NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER WE HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT THE SITUATION WOULD BE- IN THE COLLEGE'S TUITION POLICY RIGHT NOW ALL SO MUCH MOVEMENT IS GOING ON- EVEN. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- TUITION ISSUE BE ARE FREE OF CHARGE TO YOU THERE ARE MANY- DIFFERENT FORMS SO WE CAN ENCOURAGE. THE STUDENTS- AND THE PARENTS HAVE TO PREPARE FOR THE- NECESSARY COLLEGE OF FUNDING BUT- THIS IS OUR UNIVERSAL MANDATING I AM IN THE FORM OF TAX SO. I WOULD HAVE TO PULL. THE BILL. THANK YOU. SURE IS THERE IN WOULD YOU LIKE TO- GIVE US YOUR CLOSING. REMARKS THANK YOU- FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR THE ALL THE COMMENTS- I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH- MOST OF WHAT'S SAID HERE ESPECIALLY WITH THE- WITH ALL THREE SPEAKERS AND SENTIMENTS OF THE NECESSITY OF DOING SOMETHING TO. MAKE IT EASIER AND AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO COLLEGE VOCATIONAL TRAINING TECHNICAL TRAINING WHATEVER THE OPPORTUNITY MAYBE TO ENHANCE THEIR CAREER. AND SO THIS. BILL WAS AIMING. TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT PUTS THE SEED MONEY FOR IT TO GROW. IT ALSO ENCOURAGES PARENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN BECAUSE LET'S BE CLEAR HERE. THOSE OF US WHO- HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT. MODICUM OF AN INVESTMENT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE CAN DO SO BUT THAT'S SPEAKING TO LESS THAN ABOUT ROUGHLY 4% OF CALIFORNIANS HELLO CALIFORNIA PARENTS. SO IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER. AND SO IN ORDER TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE KIDS ESPECIALLY IN POORER NEIGHBORHOODS TO BE ABLE. TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE IN THE FUTURE AND ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS THROUGH AN EDUCATIONAL DEGREE OR ANY TYPE OF A DEGREE THAT WILL HELP THEM. HAVE A CAREER PATH WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE AN IMPORTANT INITIAL INVESTMENT FOR THEM SO THAT THEN THE PARENTS. PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND EVERYBODY ELSE CAN HELP FINANCE THE REST OF THE WAY THERE- I COMPLETELY AGREE ON THE BANKING SIDE OF THE ISSUE OF THE CONCERNS I TO HAVE THAT CONCERN BECAUSE IN NO WAY WOULD I WANT MY BILL. CREATE A FEE THAT WOULD THEN BE IMPOSED ON THE CURRENT GENERATION OF STUDENTS WHO NEED THAT MONEY TO BE ABLE TO FINANCE THEIR OWN EDUCATION SO. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION IN FACT MOST BANKS IF NOT ALL HAVE ALREADY WITHDRAWN THEMSELVES FROM- EDUCATIONAL LOANS LOAN INDUSTRY- WITH WALL WELLS FARGO BEING ONE OF THE LAST ONES. THEY SOLD THEIR SHARE TO NELNET LAST YEAR- AND AS YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS INDUSTRY AT LEAST THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS THE C. R. A. THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT THAT IMPOSES UPON BANKS TO ACTUALLY MAKE A REINVESTMENT BACK INTO THE POOR COMMUNITIES THAT THEY WORK IN SO THE BANKS ARE COVERED. THE EDUCATIONAL LENDING INDUSTRY DOES NOT HAVE. SUCH A GOAL. AND BEING THAT ALMOST ALL OF THEM OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YET REAP THE BENEFITS OF A LARGE MARKET LIKE CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN 10% OF THE OUTSTANDING EDUCATION LOANS ARE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OUT. AND NOT HAVING THEM MAKE AN INVESTMENT INTO IT SO. THIS WAS A LOFTY WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE REVENUE AND A LOT OF WORK REMAINS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT SO THAT WE GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY FOR THE FOR THE STATE FOR THESE CHILDREN FOR FUTURE CHILDREN TO HAVE AN EDUCATION. BUT NOT DO IT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE CURRENT GENERATION OF STUDENTS SO I SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND I'M WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND THIS BILL WILL MOST LIKELY BE A TWO YEAR ENDEAVOR IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTERS ERIN I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL AND I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. BUT I ASKED YOU TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COMMITTEE AND THE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE THREE OF THE ANALYSIS AND SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. THE WAIT FOR A QUORUM TO- TAKE THE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVE. TO FOR THE AUTHOR'S REQUEST WE'LL BE HEARING A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN- FILE ITEM FOR AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WHEN YOU ARE READY. PLEASE PROCEED. FILE ITEM FOR. A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES AB ELEVEN ELEVEN WOULD CREATE A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES MEANING THAT COMPARABLE COURSES WOULD HAVE THE SAME COURSE NUMBER AT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA. MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TAKE COURSES AT MULTIPLE COLLEGES WITHIN A DISTRICT OR EVEN ACROSS DISTRICTS WITHOUT A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM IT IS HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO PLAN OUT A COHERENT ROADMAP. TURNING THEIR DEGREE. CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY HAS THE COURSE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER IN SYSTEM C. ID SYSTEM WHICH IS A WAY TO IDENTIFY COMPARABLE CALMING FORCES. HOWEVER COURSES THAT HAVE THE SAME C. ID NUMBER OR STILL NUMBERED DIFFERENTLY FOR THE STUDENTS. THESE DIFFERENCES IN COURSE NUMBERS CAN UNINTENTIONALLY SET STUDENTS BACK SERVING AS A BARRIER TO TIMELY TRANSFER. IN FEBRUARY. THE GOVERNOR'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TASK FORCE RELEASED A REPORT WHICH INCLUDED A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AIMED AT HELPING CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC. ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO DEVELOP A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT STUDENTS TRANSFERRING TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS KNOW. AS THEY'RE PURSUING THEIR CURSES THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RECEIVING INSTITUTIONS. MAYBE ELEVEN ELEVEN IS BASED ON THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ADOPT A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM BY STARTING WITH COURSES INCLUDED IN THE C. ID. AND EXPANDING TO JERK TO INCLUDE GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND TRANSFER PATHWAY COURSES. THIS BILL BUILDS UPON C. ID AND RECOGNIZE THE C. IDEAS A CRITICAL STEP TO DEVELOPING A STUDENT FACING COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM. HAVING THE SAME COURSE NUMBER FOR ALL COMPARABLE COURSES AT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD REDUCE UNNECESSARY CONFUSION. IS ADVISING REDUCE EXCESS CREDIT CANNULATION AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO TRANSFER AND EARN THEIR DEGREE. SEEKING STUDENTS BOTH TIME AND MONEY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN AT T. MODERATOR THE FIRST LEAD WITNESS ON THE LINE FOR A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN IS GERALD RICHARDSON.

GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE. THE SUCCESS OF A LARGER- SINCE IT'S VERY INSTEAD OF A LARGE MULTI CALIBER DISTRICT WE HAVE FOUR SEPARATELY ACCREDITED COLLEGES. AND ARE THE SECOND LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE PALACE GO TO THE MOMENT. SO OUR FACULTY HAS BEEN PIONEERS IN ADOPTING COMMON COURSE NUMBER ACROSS OUR FOUR COLLEGES AND THE BENEFITS IN YOUR FROM A STUDENT ARE JUST THE MPS AND REDUCING. BARRIERS TO COMPLETION AND IN OUR LARGE DIVERSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. MANY OF OUR STUDENTS TO ATTEND COLLEGES OUTSIDE OF ONE DISTRICT SO REDUCING BARRIERS AND MAKING THE PROCESS MORE SIMPLE IS JUST A HUGE BENEFIT. FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH DISAGREEMENT THAT SIMPLICITY BENEFITS OUR STUDENTS BUT THE REALITY IS WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT DISTRICTS IN SUCH A COMMITMENT TO A ROBUST SHARED GOVERNANCE PROCESS. WE HAVE AN EASIER TIME AGREEING ON A CONCEPT AND WE DO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THE CONCEPT AT TIMES AND THAT'S WHERE EFFORTS WHITE AT ELEVEN ELEVEN CAN REALLY GIVE US THE KNOWLEDGE. AND AN INCENTIVE.

EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A TRANSFER BILL THE CSU AND UC HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION AND ARE NOT BEING ASKED TO OVERHAUL THEIR SYSTEMS. IT STILL DOES NOT CONSIDER LOCAL CONTROL THE STRUCTURE OF ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS RETIRED NUMBERS NEEDED DISCREPANCIES HE QUITTING OLD WITH NEW NUMBERS OR NEW SUPPLEMENTAL COURSES. THIS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS CHANGING A NUMBER ON A WEBSITE THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF DEVELOPMENT CODING TRAINING AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT. IT WOULD DISTRACT FACULTY AT A TIME WHEN OUR STUDENTS NEED OUR SUPPORT AND PRESENCE WE FACULTY NEED TO SPEND OUR TIME IMPROVING OUR ONLINE PEDAGOGY AND DECOLONIZING OUR CURRICULA TO SERVE THE MOST DIVERSE STUDENTS IN THE NATION.

THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS BILL. AND I WANT TO- SHARE. THAT SOMETIMES THINGS THAT LOOK SIMPLE OR NOT. AND SO I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT. COMMON CORE'S NUMBER IN WHICH SOUNDS SO EASY. HAS THE EQUAL LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY TO IT. I AM SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND I TRUSTED THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO. OUTREACH AND FIND AREAS OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING. FUNDAMENTALLY STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO REGISTER FOR THEIR CLASSES KNOWING WHAT THE CLASS IS WHAT THE PER RIGHT WHICH IS OUR AND HOW THAT COURSE WILL HELP THEM ACCOMPLISH THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS I. THINK THE BELL BILL IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM I WILL BE SUPPORTING VOTING AND SUPPORT. AND WITHOUT A QUORUM WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO. YOUR NEXT BILL MISTER BERMAN A. B. NINE TWO EIGHT FINAL ITEM THREE. THANK YOU MR CHAIR. I'M HAPPY THE ONLY SERVICING I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT SPECIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS AS CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION I'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM STUDENTS WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR TRANSFER EXPERIENCE THE MESSAGE WAS LOUD AND CLEAR THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS TOO COMPLEX CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. AS CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS CRITICAL THAT INCREASED DEGREE ATTAINMENT IMPROVE TIME 2 DEGREES AND CLOSE A RACIAL EQUITY GAPS EIGHTY NINE TWENTY IT WOULD TRANSFORM THE TRANSFER PROCESS. THREE THREE SIGNIFICANT STUDENT CENTERED PROVISIONS. FIRST THE BOLD CREEDON INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATION COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT VENUE. TO FACILITATE INTER SEGMENTAL COORDINATION AND GREATER STATE LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. AND A FOCUS ON IMPROVING TRANSFER OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. SECOND THE BILL WOULD SET A TARGET DATE FOR CSU AND UC TO ESTABLISH A SINGULAR LOWER DIVISION GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAY THAT NEEDS TRANSFER ADMISSION TO BOTH. GOING FROM TWO GENERAL EDUCATION PATHWAYS TO ONE MAKES IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS. TO APPLY TO BOTH CSU AND UC AND KEEP THEIR OPTIONS OPEN. THIRD THE BORDER PARK COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO BE PLACED. ON AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER PATHWAY WHERE ONE EXISTS FOR THEIR MAJOR. SINCE THE AT T. GUARANTEES ADMISSION TO THE CSU SYSTEM AND PARTICIPATING PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. THIS PROVISION WILL MAXIMIZE THE PROBABILITY THAT A STUDENT WILL TRANSFER AND COMPLETE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN A TIMELY MANNER. EVEN AT T. DOES NOT EXIST IN THE STUDENTS CHOSE A MAJOR. THEN THERE IS NO AT T. FOR THE STUDENT TO BE PLACED ON. IMPORTANTLY STUDENTS CAN OPT OUT. AT OUR POWER TO CHOOSE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM AND THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. ALSO NOTHING IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS A STUDENT FROM BEING ON THE AT T. PATHWAY AND ALSO APPLYING TO TRANSFER. TO UC OR PRIVATE INSTITUTION. THE TROUBLING REALITIES OF THE STATUS QUO IS FAILING OUR STUDENTS. ONLY 20% OF STUDENTS FOR THE TRANSFER GOAL SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER WITHIN SIX YEARS. THIS IS SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER IN CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN THE FIRST LEAD WITNESS AND SUPPORT. IN THE U. WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM THERE'S A LOT MORE RESEARCH GOOD TERRACE. THE STUDENT CENTER IS A STATE UNIVERSITY. MISKIN TERRACE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. THIS IS JESSE RYAN WITH THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY I WILL BE TESTIFYING FIRST. GOOD MORNING SHARON GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSE RYAN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY A STATEWIDE RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ENSURING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. I'M ALSO A PROUD FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENT REPRESENTING PART OF AN ASTONISHING LESS THAN 3% OF STUDENTS. THAT WILL SUCCESSFULLY REACH THEIR TRANSFER GOAL WITHIN THREE YEARS OF ENROLLING. FOR LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS LIKE ME CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE GATEWAY TO OPPORTUNITY. AND IMPROVED ECONOMIC OUTCOMES THEY ALSO SERVE A CRITICAL FUNCTION IN ADVANCING EDUCATIONAL EQUITY FOR THE LARGE BLACK IN LATIN NEXT YOU CAN POPULATIONS THEY SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY ACHIEVING TIMELY TRANSFER REMAINS OUT OF REACH FOR FAR TOO MANY STUDENTS DUE TO NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT RATHER DUE TO THE COMPLEX TRANSFORMATIONS THAT THEY MUST NAVIGATE. TO BUILD UPON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHTING THE DISSIMILAR TRANSFERASE THE DATA IS EVEN MORE ALARMING FOR OUR BLACK AND LATINX STUDENTS WELL THAT NEXT DIDN'T REPRESENT 51% OF STUDENTS WHO DECLARE A GOAL OF EARNING A DEGREE IN SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERRING. THEY ONLY REPRESENT 35% OF STUDENTS WHO TRANSFER WITHIN FOUR YEARS FOR BLACK STUDENTS THIS DATA IS EVEN WORSE. EIGHTY NINE TO EIGHT DRAWS INTENTIONAL STATE WIDE FOCUS TO STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S TRANSFER PROCESS AND STREAMLINES OUR TRANSFER PROCESS TO BE EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE BY BUILDING ON TEN YEARS OF PROGRESS OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. THE BILL WAS INFORMED IN TWO YEARS OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENTS HIGHER EDUCATION PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS REGIONAL PARTNERS AND NUMEROUS RESEARCH STUDIES THAT MAKE CLEAR WILL PROGRESS TO SIMPLIFY TRANSFER HAS BEEN MADE. THE STATE NEEDS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON CONTINUED WORKING TO STREAMLINE THE PATH. THE DATA IS CLEAR WE'RE AT T.

ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ADVANTIS YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR A LONG ME TO PRESENT SOMEBODY BUILT ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE TODAY. AS THIS STATE FOR DECADES WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS IMPROVING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION HOWEVER THROUGH THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC INCREASED RATES OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DEATH AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED ARE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AS THEY HAVE WATCHED FAMILY MEMBERS GET INFECTED REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION OR EVEN DIED MANY STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO LEAVE COLLEGE IN ORDER TO FIND WORKS THEY CAN HELP SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. THIS IS- AN ABSTRACT PROBLEM THE NUMBER STUDENTS ENROLLING IN COLLEGE IMMEDIATELY AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL DROP NEARLY IS UNDERMINING THE CONSIDERABLE PROCESS THAT STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE BEEN MADE. HAD MADE AN ACCESS THE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN RECENT DECADES AS WE ALL KNOW INSURING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ARE MORE AFFORDABLE IS VITAL TO IMPROVING ACCESS TO OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DESTRUCTIONS AND LIFE EVENTS CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC HAVE MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR MANY STUDENTS TO MEET CERTAIN CAL GRANT PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO TIME LIMITS FOR ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING THOSE GREAT- REGARDING A STUDENT'S AGE. WITHOUT THE PER OF AN ADDITIONAL TIME IN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO MEET THESE CAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS MANY STUDENTS ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR WILL BE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE FINANCIAL AID THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO THE STUDENTS BY ALLOWING THEM TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR TO MEET. I. CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS ERICA METAL FROM THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY. AND LAURA- CZAR- BIDS FROM THE INSTITUTION- FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS.

MANY OF THEM ARE FIRST GENERATION AND LOW INCOME HAVE ACCESS TO THE FINANCIAL AID THAT IS SO CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR MOWING THE BUT LOWERING THE BARRIER TO HIGHER EDUCATION BUT ALSO SUCCEEDING IN COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE. WE ALL NOTICED DEMOCRATS TAKING A DISPROPORTIONATE TOLL ON OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA 55% OF KIDS WHO TOLD STUDENTS ABOUT BEING. WE KNOW FROM DATA THAT ASSET AND KEEP APPLICATIONS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC INDICATING THAT FEWER FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS PLAN ON ATTENDING COLLEGE THIS FALL IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WERE MANY LATINO STUDENTS START THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS HAVE ALREADY SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THEIR OFFICE. THIS INDICATOR MOST ECONOMICALLY INSECURE STUDENTS ARE NOT ENROLLING IN COLLEGE STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IN GREATER NUMBERS THAN NORMAL WE BELIEVE THE VARIETY OF REASONS MOST OF THEM ARE ECONOMICS. AND A LAW STUDENTS HAVE ONLY A YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION TO USE THEIR CATTLE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. AFTER THAT TIME TO TURN INTO A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM POOL WHERE THERE ARE FAR TOO FEW COOK CALIBRATE FOR THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WANT THEM. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION TO AT LEAST ALLOW THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO WERE IMPACTED BY COPE WITH ADDITIONAL TIME TO ENROLL AND COMPLETE COLLEGE WITH ACCESS TO RETIREMENT CAL GRANT. DEPENDABLE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THE STATE IS IN AN ECONOMIC DECISION TO ALLOW THEM TO USE THEIR COVERAGE IN THE FUTURE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR EIGHTY ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE SO THAT MORE OF OUR STATES LOW INCOME STUDENTS CAN COMPLETE. THEIR DEGREE IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THE YOU. WE WERE- NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT C.

THIS MEASURE WILL HAPPILY. HELP GREATLY ASSIST STUDENTS RETURNED BACK TO THEIR COLLEGE PROGRAMS- IT WILL ENJOY A DO PASS. RECOMMENDATION WHEN WE HAVE A MAJORITY- SO WE'LL GO NOW TO THE NEXT BILLING FILE ORDER- A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN FILE ITEM SEVEN MR VANTAGE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN TODAY AND THINKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENCE WORK ON THIS BILL BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ARE NOTED ON PAGE FOR THE HOUSES- ONCE THE BILL DOES REACH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OVER RECENT DECADES IT HAS BEEN CLEAR THAT UNIVERSITIES NEED TO REEVALUATE THEIR APPROACH TO THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SHIFT TO TRAUMA CENTERED POLICIES TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT MAKE SURVIVORS MORE LIKELY TO REPORT AND FOLLOW THROUGH WILL- WHICH CHARGES IS TO. IS THE PRESENCE OF TRAINED SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ON CAMPUSES HOWEVER MANY COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE THEIR POLICY IN THIS SPACE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE. AND ARE OFTEN AT ODDS WITH THE TRAUMA AND SURVIVOR CENTERED RESPONSE THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS DO PROVIDE. THIS MEANS THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS AND COMPLYING WITH CAMPUS POLICIES THAT MAY NOT PRIORITIZE THOSE NEEDS. TO FULLY SUPPORT SURVIVORS IN A TRAUMA INFORMED AND SURVIVOR CENTERED PRACTICE IT IS VITAL THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARE ABLE TO FOCUS PRIMARILY. ON PROVIDING FOR THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS. THE ROLE OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS TO PROVIDE ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO THE SURVIVOR AND TO SUPPORT ANY DECISION THE SURVIVOR MADE. OR MAKES. THIS MAY EVEN INCLUDE ACTIONS AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY THIS MEANS THAT. THOUGH THEY MAY BE DOING WHAT IS BEST INTEREST FOR THE SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR MAY FEAR LOSING THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR FACING OTHER KINDS OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION. WHEN UNIVERSITIES MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT HAMPER THE ABILITY OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY THEY ENABLE A CAMPUS CLIMATE DOT DOES CONDONE SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SILENCES SURVIVORS. AB FORTY SIXTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE CLARITY TO SUCH SITUATIONS BY ESTABLISHING THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE CAMPUS TITLE NINE OFFICE. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW SEXUAL SO CAMP COUNSELORS TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY WITH SURVIVORS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CAMPUS BASED SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS TO HAVE ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS AND THE ABILITY TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE UNIVERSITY WITHOUT FEAR OR RICHARD GUY RETRIBUTION. BY ENSURING THAT CAMPUS CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS WE WILL ENSURE THAT THEY IN TURN HAVE BETTER TOOLS TO SUPPORT STUDENT SURVIVORS WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY IS NICOLE BUT AT A- DOCTORAL STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. SHE'S ALSO A NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOW WHO RESEARCH FOCUSES ON HOW UNIVERSITIES MANAGE SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THANK YOU MR RUN THURS EIGHTEEN T. MODERATOR THE LEAD WITNESS MISS NICOLE THE DERA- THIS BIGGER PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS NICOLE THERE I'M A DOCTORAL CANDIDATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND I THIRTY CAMPUS SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IN MY RESEARCH I'VE SEEN THE WAY VICTIM ADVOCATES ARE PULLED IN TWO DIRECTIONS FOR BETWEEN ADVOCATING FOR SURVIVORS AND PROTECTING THEIR INSTITUTION. APPLE UNIVERSITY I THOUGHT STUDIED PROHIBITED ADVOCATE FROM TELLING A SURVIVOR THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT THE DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. OR MAKING INFORMATION ABOUT REPORTING PROCESS EASILY AVAILABLE AS A RESULT MANY SURVIVORS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE FILED REPORTS CORRECTLY HAVE MADE MISTAKES BUT THE REALTOR EFFORT. I THINK THE MEDICAID CLIFF CORRECT THESE MISSTEPS BUT THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HELP. THE TENSION AND ROLLED WAVE ON MEDICARE MANY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE OF THEIR WORK INCLUDING SUICIDALITY. SOME WERE FORCED TO QUIT IN AN ACT OF SELF PRESERVATION OTHERS WERE PUSHED OUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO BEND THE RULES TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS EFFECTIVELY. AS A RESULT THE VICTIM ADVOCACY OFFICE BECAME MORE OF ALL THE DOORS STAFF WHO LEFT THEIR POSITIONS JUST BECAUSE THEY GOT GOOD AT THEIR JOBS. THE OPERATIVE UNDERSTAFFED A NEW HIRES WERE UNDERPREPARED TO NAVIGATE UNIVERSITY SPECIFIC POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES. DID HURT SURVIVORS THE RESOURCE OF LEGISLATORS ARE BROUGHT TO CAMPUS ARE OUT OF REACH WITHOUT A TON OF VICTIM ADVOCATES. BILL COULD CHANGE THAT AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

I APOLOGIZE THEY'RE QUEUING UP FOR DIFFERENT- THE- TONIGHT WE HAVE NO ONE TO YOU FOR TWO YEARS NO NO TWEETERS MR MODERN. CORRECT THEY WERE QUEUING UP- AT THE WRONG TIME THANK YOU- WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE THEN ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE- MR CARTER CHOICE. AS A MEMBER OF LOCAL I- SEE- NOW SOME MERIT SEE HERE INCLUDE INCREASING THE TRANSPARENCY ON THEIR FINANCIAL- SITUATION IS- HOWEVER WHEN YOU REQUIRE AT THIS- FINANCIAL AID REPORTS- TO BE MANDATED OF IDEAS SO- BILL OR TO THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES SO. WITH THAT DATA YOU HAVE COLLECTED WHAT IS YOUR- PLAN WHAT. TO DO WITH THAT THOSE THOSE DATA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS YOU KNOW- BECAUSE THIS IS TAX SUBSIDIZED AND THERE'S PUBLIC TAXPAYER SUPPORT FOR THIS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE INDICTMENTS ARE GOING FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT IT'S DIRECTLY GOING TO THE STUDENTS. AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE MANY ENDOWMENTS THAT HAVE GROWN TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND CONTINUES THE DUDE IS- AND THAT TRAJECTORY AND SO WE WANT TO HELP INSURE THAT IS GOING FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT- YOU NATURALLY YOU MAY. REQUIRE OR EVEN NONPROFIT PRIVATE COLLEGES- WHEN THEY HAVE- IT ENOUGH FOR EXCEEDING CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEIGHT AND ALMOST SO FOR THEM TO SPEND DOWN AND UP- IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS. I THINK THE INTENDED PURPOSE TO ENSURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO THOSE INTENDED PURPOSES FOR THOSE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AND THAT WE NEED TO SHED LIGHT ON MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK WITH INSTITUTIONS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING. OKAY I- SEE YEAH. THIS IS- YEAH THEY HAVE GOOD TASTE GOOD SIZE SO IT IS SYSTEM SOME SCHOOLS- HAVE ACCUMULATED A PIANIST AS YOU HAVE SEEN MY SHOWN IN THE DATA SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. IN COLLEGES HAVE ACCUMULATED AND- WHAT THEY WILL DO- IN THE ENCOURAGING THEM OR MAKING THEM TO SPEND PEOPLE'S MONEY FOR FINANCIAL AID THAT IS SO GOOD I THINK- NTEND TO BUT- PRIVATE COLLEGES. WHEN THE STATE DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY DIRECT AID TO THE SCHOOL EVEN SO SOON SO MAY BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A GRANT- I MEAN IT COULD BE- INDIVIDUAL ACADEMIC FREEDOM- THEY MAY HAVE A CERTAIN PLANS FOR THE FUTURE- THE CAMPUS EXPANSION OR- BUILDING PROJECTS- ETCETERA SO- IS- IS- IS SELECTED INTRUSION INTO THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM- WHEN WE DON'T PROVIDE THE- ANY DIRECT AID TO TWO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. V. DE AS AS YOU AS YOU MAY UNDERSTAND- TAXES DOWN WITH DAVID DOMINANCE THE TAXATION IS PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED AT TAXPAYERS' BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE THAT BENEFIT THAT THERE'S COMES ALONG WITH THE OBLIGATION TO HAVE GREATER TRANSPARENCY IN THE PROCESS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS INTENDED TO BE ABLE TO DO TO ENSURE THAT IN FACT THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IF INDEED THAT YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENTS IN THE STATE. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR CHOI ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE SELL- IS SINCE SO THE CURRENT AND DOMINANCE- AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS MODEL FOR THE ODOMETER NONPROFITS AND THE MONEY IS ALREADY TAXED AND WHEN THE DONOR. GIVE THAT MONEY R. AS A PARTY IN DAMAGE TO THE INSTITUTION. NOW THERE'S ALREADY FEDERAL LAW THAT REGULATES HOW. IT WOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW FOR AN INSTITUTION TO MISAPPROPRIATE FUNDS. AND AT THE INTENTION OF THE DONOR SO IS THIS A LITTLE BIT DUPLICITOUS IF THERE'S ALREADY A LAWN THERE IS ALREADY A PROCESS TO MONITOR- ENDOWMENTS AND NONPROFIT FUNDS. NO OVER THEM TO THE CONTRARY IT'S ACTUALLY- TO HELP INSURE THAT THERE'S GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON DATA PURPOSE AS YOU MAY KNOW SOME OF THESE INDICTMENTS HAVE GROWN. TO FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND UP BILLION DOLLARS- AND THESE ENDOWMENTS AND WHEN THEY ANSWER THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF IT IS BEING SPENT DIRECTLY TO THAT OF THEIR DIRECTIVE PURPOSE IN ADDITION AS YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A FINANCIAL TAX BENEFIT FOR THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT OFFICE FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE WE MADE FOR THEN DOWNLOADS I THINK THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S ENOUGH FOR A DOWN TO GROW TO FIFTY BILLION TWO HUNDRED BILLION. IF THAT IT WAS THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE SPECIFICALLY WAS TO HELP FORD'S AGAIN INTENDED PURPOSE SELF THIS IS A TRANSPARENCY BILL THIS IS JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA IS THERE TO BEST HELP ENSURE THAT- THOSE ATTEND PURPOSES ARE ACTUALLY OCCURRING I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY FOR SMALLER NONPROFITS THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE BILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENTS OR OR DONATIONS- BECAUSE IT IS SETTING A PRECEDENT SO THAT'S DEEPLY CONCERNING TO ME AND- I UNDERSTAND. YOUR INTENT BUT IT IS A CONCERN OF MINE. I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE- MISTER LOWE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. ARE STRICTLY ESCRIBO. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I BELIEVE THAT BY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY ON THE LARGE ENDOWMENTS AT SOME OF OUR MOST PRESTIGIOUS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN OUR STATE SHOULD ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE AND BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. HOW INDICTMENTS PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS AND IN IN MANY CASES THOSE STUDENTS ARE UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. BUT I ASKED THE OTHER TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AS OUTLINED ON PAGES THREE AND FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. DO I HAVE A MOTION. MR BLOOM. SECOND I MISS RUBIO THE MOTION BEFORE IS DO PASTOR THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA. MEDINA HI JULY VOTER CHOICE NOT VOTING A ROMULAN BLOOM. BLOOM HI GABRIEL- WHEN KYLIE LEVIN LOW LEVEL II RUBIO RUBIO HI SANTIAGO BALLADARES. NO THERE'S NOT VOTING. THAT'S FOUR ZERO BILLS ON CALL FOUR ZERO THE BILL IS ON CALL AND SEEING NO OTHER AUTHORS HERE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM THIRTEEN. EIGHTY NINE TWENTY SEVEN. AND THEN ITEM FOURTEEN A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY SIX. YOUR CHOICE. OKAY IS IT YOUR VIEW YES. OKAY WE WERE ABLE TO DO. FILE I'M THIRTEEN FIRST. OKAY ARE YOU PRESENTING- EIGHTY NINE TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU FIVE FIVE PHONE NUMBER THIRTEEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE A. B. NINE TWENTY SEVEN THE PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO ELIMINATING THE SKILLS GAPS AND ENABLING UNDERS AND REPRESENTED STUDENTS TO COMPETE IN CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT AND FUTURE ECONOMY. THE MISSION OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE INCLUDES PROVIDING ITS STUDENTS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND BACKGROUND NECESSARY TO COMPETE IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT IN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ENTRY LEVEL WORK HAVE INCREASINGLY INCLUDED BACCALAUREATE DEGREES. GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SOLIDIFIED THE MISSION BY SIGNING SB EIGHT FIFTY AUTHORIZING THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PILOT PROGRAM AT NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN COLLEGES. THE CURRENT PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BACCALAUREATE PILOTS ARE PORTABLE AND DIVERSE. IF CURRENT TRENDS PERSIST 38% OF THE JOBS WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE POPULATION IN EDUCATIONAL TRENDS SUGGEST THAT ONLY 33% OF WORKING ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA WE'LL HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BY TWENTY THIRTY. SHORTFALL OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION COLLEGE GRADUATES. THERE'S A CLEAR NEED AND DESIRE FOR MORE DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN EXPANDED PILOT PROGRAM. HOWEVER THE CURRENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES THAT OFFER BACCALAUREUS HAVE LIMITED EXPANSION. MOREOVER THE PILOT SUNSETS ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX REQUIRING ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM. A. B. NINE TWENTY SEVEN WILL EXTEND THE OPERATION OF THE STATEWIDE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PILOT PROGRAM INDEFINITELY. MOREOVER THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE PROGRAM CONSIST OF FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT SEEKING APPROVAL TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF UNMET WORKFORCE NEEDS. THIS WILL ALLOW UP TO THIRTY PROGRAMS A YEAR. FINALLY A. B. NINE TWENTY SEVEN WILL MANDATE THAT THE CHANCELLOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE COLLEGES CONSULT WITH AND SEEK FEEDBACK FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I PROPOSE BACCALAUREATE DEGREES TO AVOID DUPLICATION. FOR STUDENTS TO COMPETE IN TODAY'S ECONOMY IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE SEIZE ON THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND EXPAND THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAM HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHANCELLOR CONSTANCE CARROLL FROM THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT VASSY VARGAS GRADUATE OF THE WEST LOS ANGELES COLLEGE DENTAL. HYGIENE PROGRAM. THANK YOU I AM A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. THE TWENTY NINE ERROR- AT THE SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. THERE ARE TWO POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE. FOLLOWING A HEARTFELT THANK YOU TO CHAIRMAN DANA FOR HIS SUPPORT SITE IN OFFERING THIS BILL. FIRST THE BILL ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT MANY EMPLOYERS AND JOBS THAT USED TO REQUIRE AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE NOW PREFERRED THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR REQUIRED THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE WHICH THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES DO NOT OFFER IN THESE WORK FORCE FIELD- AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE ENSURED THAT THERE WILL BE NO DUPLICATION OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITY PROGRAM. IN THIS EXPANSION. SECOND THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS. IT MAKES SENSE IT'S A PORTABLE ANTENNA AND LESS THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. EIGHTY SIX IT IS ACCEPTABLE- FOUR TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND STUDENTS WHO WOULD SEEK ADVANCEMENT- IT'S DIVERSE IN ITS SERVICE POPULATION OVER 60% OF THE STUDENTS IN THE PILOTS ARE STUDENTS OF COLOR. 85% THAT JOB THE AVERAGE SALARY INCREASE IS THE RESULT OF THE STUDENTS GRADUATING IN TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. AN IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA NINETY FOUR PERCENT. OF THE GRADUATES REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE AND WE URGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THAT MUST MEAN- DOCTOR CAROL OF MOVING ON TO SECOND LEAD WITH NEWS. ACCORDING IN IS. I'M ACTUALLY- VARGAS A GRADUATE OF THE WEST LOS ANGELES OF COLLEGES DISTRICT- ARJUN PROGRAM WHENEVER YOU ARE REAY MISS VARGAS GO AHEAD. OKAY HELLO MY NAME IS ABOUT THE BARGAIN I AM A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE GRADUATE FROM THE WEST LOS ANGELES DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM BUT THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN COMING FROM A LARGE HISPANIC FARM MY PARENTS COULD NOT AFFORD TO SEND ME TO COLLEGE FOR THIS REASON I CHOSE TO ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM AT WESTLEIGH DRAMATICALLY CHANGED MY LIFE I WENT FROM SERVING TABLE TWENTY YEARS TO BECOMING A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL THE NEXT YEAR IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER I OBTAINED MY DENTAL HYGIENE MY SON. THAT I WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH MYSELF IN AN OFFICE AND BEGIN PRACTICING MY PROFESSION I AM TRULY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BY POTENTIAL COLLEGES AND AT THE ONE FIFTY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL CAREER WITHOUT FINANCIAL BURDEN I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES.
