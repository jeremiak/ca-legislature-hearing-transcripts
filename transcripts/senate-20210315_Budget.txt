SO WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CORPSMAN LET ME WELCOME OUR NEW COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR COMELEC WELCOME SO NOW LET ME TO CONTINUE. R. AS I INDICATED WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY OR CONTINUATION OF THE EARLY BUDGET ACTIONS WE'VE BEEN TAKING TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S ONGOING RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND THESE EARLY ACTIONS SO FAR HAVE INCLUDED DEPLOYING ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO SUPPORT OUR SMALL LANDLORDS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN. PAGE DUE TO THEIR TENANTS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC. HARDSHIP AND TO SUPPORT OF COURSE ARE TURNED INTO A BIG MEN EXPERIENCING THAT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND WE ALSO IN THE SAME ACTIONS EXTENDED OUR EVICTION PROTECTIONS WE EXPANDED OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS AND ARE PROVIDING NOW TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN SUPPORT TO OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS THAT HAVE BEEN HURT BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND HAVE. ACTED ON THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN DIRECT STIMULUS FUNDS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS AND TO RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT BENEFIT FROM PREVIOUS FEDERAL STIMULUS. ARENDT WE HAVE AUTHORIZED SIX POINT SIX BILLION TO HELP OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND PROVIDE THE SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION IN SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED. AS STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS RECOVER FROM THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. NOW TWO DAYS PAID SICK LEAVE BILL AB EIGHTY FOUR IS PART OF AN AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO OUR BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYEES. UNTIL THE BILL UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROVIDES EIGHTY HOURS OF PAID LEAVE. TO EMPLOYEES TO CARE FROM THEIR SELVES OR FAMILY MEMBERS DUE TO COBIT. COVERT SYMPTOMS QUARANTINE TREATMENT VACCINATION AND VACCINE RESPONSE. AND THIS PROVIDES PAID LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES TO CARE FOR SPECIFIED FAMILY MEMBES WHO MAY HAVE TO QUARANTINE DUE TO COPE IT OR TO TAKE CARE OF A CHILD. WHO SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED. DUE TO COBIT. THIS ACTION EXCLUDES BUSINESSES IN TERMS OF IT BEING MANDATORY WITH TWENTY FIVE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES HOWEVER. THE TAX CREDITS WHICH I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE BUSINESSES WITH TWENTY FIVE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE OF COURSE ALL BUSINESSES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. BECAUSE THIS ACTION RESULTS IN VIRTUALLY NO COST TO BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT THE NOTICE TO TAX CREDIT ON PAYROLL TAXES. NO IT'S PART OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR- TWO HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON. SOME TAX CONFORMITY FOR THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM BUT WE HAVE DELAYED THAT ACTION AS WE SEEK FEDERAL GUIDANCE REGARDING SOME PROVISIONS IN THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED. THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY ACTION WE TAKE DOES NOT JEOPARDIZE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO. FULLY ACCESS ALL OF THE FUNDING THAT THAT RECOVERY ACT HAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE ARE STILL SEEKING GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDS FOR THAT. WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY AFTER HEARING ALL THREE OF THE BILLS AND THEN THE VOTE WILL BE TAKEN ON THE BILLS AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT. AND BEFORE WE HEAR FROM OUR- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M LOOKING TO SEE IF OUR VICE CHAIRS HERE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM NOT IN THE ROOM YET I WILL ALLOW HIM TO MAKE COMMENTS LATER. SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FIRST BILL AB EIGHTY THREE WHICH IS THE CLEAN UP TO THE LICENSE RENEWAL FEES BILL AND I DIDN'T DESCRIBE THAT AS PART OF OUR EARLY ACTIONS BUT AS YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL EARLY ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK TO SUPPORT OUR- BUSINESS COMMUNITY WAS TO SUSPEND CERTAIN LICENSE PAYMENTS FOR THEM AND THIS BILL IS CLEANING UP SOME OF THAT SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU MAY PLEASE PRESENT. ON AB EIGHTY THREE. GREAT GOOD MORNING CHAIR SKINNER VICE CHAIR NELSON MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ONLY JARVIS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE IS RELATED TO FEE WAIVERS FOR SPECIFIC BUSINESSES LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL.

EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE ADDS THREE ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHT SMALL WINEGROWERS SMALL BEER MANUFACTURERS AND CRAFT DISTILLERS TO THOSE TWENTY SEVEN TYPE OPERATION SB NINETY FOUR. JURIES THE WAIVERS FOR ANNUAL LICENSING FEES. WE ESTIMATE THESE WAIVERS WILL PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF TO APPROXIMATELY. FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ADDITIONAL LICENSE FEES INCLUDING ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED WINEGROWERS TO PRODUCE. A LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF WINE PER YEAR. ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED SMALL BEER MANUFACTURERS AND ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY CRAFT DISTILLERS. THIS BILL APPROPRIATES THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO BACK THE LAST SPECIAL FRIEND REVENUE THAT LICENSEES OTHERWISE PAGE NOT APARTMENT. THE PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S ORIGINAL EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC RELIEF TO THE LICENSEES HARDEST HIT. BY THE CODE NINETEEN BENJAMIN. NECKING WITH MY- I'M AVAIL FOR FASTER. WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- R. MISTER URBIS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES ABOUT THIS- ADDITION TO OUR- BUSINESSES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FUNERAL ANY QUESTIONS BY MEMBERS- SEEING NINE- WE WILL. DOCTOR TO TAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT THE ENTIRETY SAID THAT SO I'M JUST REMINDING MYSELF- SO WE WILL NOW GO TO THE PRESENTATION ON THE NEXT BILL WHICH IS AB EIGHTY FOUR THAT'S THE SUPPLEMENTAL. PAID SICK LEAVE THAT I DESCRIBED SO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE PROCEED ON AB EIGHTY FOUR. RIGHT THANK YOU. THIS BILL REQUIRES EMPLOYERS PROVIDE UP TO EIGHTY THE COMPANY TEAMS UP WITH NO PAID SICK LEAVE TO ALL EMPLOYEES SEPTEMBER THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOWEVER EXEMPTS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYERS WITH TWENTY FIVE OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL ARE RETROACTIVE TO SICK LEAVE TAKEN BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND PROVIDES COVER NINETEEN SUPPLEMENT PAID SICK LEAVE FOR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND WEBER PERSONAL CARE SERVICES PROVIDER'S. ELIGIBILITY IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS LATELY ENACTED STATUTE THAT EXPIRED IN DECEMBER ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY HOWEVER THIS BILL ADDS- AND ADDS. THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR APPOINTMENTS FOR KOBE NINETEEN VACCINE OR FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THE BACKSEAT. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I CHRIS COOK IS WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANDESITE POINTED OUT. WHILE THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE THE PARTICIPATION OF EMPLOYERS OF IMPACT TWENTY FIVE OR LESS EMPLOYEES. IT IS STILL SOMETHING AVAILABLE TO THOSE EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THE TAX CREDITS THAT THE FEDS HAVE MADE AVAILABLE. WOULD BE ABLE TO BE UTILIZED BY THAT EMPLOYER SO IF THAT EMPLOYER WANTS TO EXTEND. THIS THE BENEFIT. TO THEIR EMPLOYEES THEY CERTAINLY MAY- SENATOR GROW DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT I DO MADAM CHAIR GO AHEAD HERE I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I HAVE AND I HAVE HUGE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL- ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT I HAVE IS. I'D LIKE SOMEBODY TO ADDRESS THE RETROACTIVITY. SO THIS BILL- IS RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY FIRST AND BY THE TIME THIS BILL GETS ASSIGNED IF WHEN IT PASSES IT WILL BE PROBABLY MARCH I DON'T KNOW. NEXT MONDAY IS WHAT I'M THINKING. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS CALENDAR YEAR EMPLOYED PEOPLE FROM JANUARY FIRST TWO WHATEVER THE BILL SIGNING DATE IS IN THIS BILL RETROACTIVELY MAKES THIS A JANUARY FIRST COMPLIANCE TO EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDS FOR CEMENT TO ENFORCE- A BILL EMPLOYERS THAT WAS NOT YET IN EXISTENCE. BUT REQUIRES ATTENTION TO COMPLY RETROACTIVELY. THE REASON WHY I HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE PREMISE OF THE BILL BUT ALSO THERE IS A BILL GOING TO THIS BUILDING THAT IS GOING TO PUT. EMPLOYERS IN JAIL FOR WHAT IS CONSIDERED WAGE THEFT OR NOT PAYING EMPLOYEES ARE PROPERLY. SO UNDER THIS BILL THIS BUDGET BILL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW I KNOW IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT UNDER THIS BUDGET BILL RIGHT NOW RETROACTIVELY DATING THIS TO JANUARY FIRST. AND THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO DID NOT COMPLY WITH PAYING EMPLOYEES- BECAUSE IT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY LAW. TO PAY THE EIGHTY HOURS A SICKLY FOR SOMEONE SEEKING ASSISTANCE FOR COVERT RELIEF FOR COVERT SYMPTOMS ARE CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PAGA LAWSUITS AND WAGE THEFT VIOLATIONS FOR NOT PAYING THEM FOR A BILL THAT DID NOT EXIST UNTIL WE PASSED THIS BILL. SO THAT RETROACTIVITY BACK TO JANUARY FIRST EXTREMELY CONCERNS ME AND I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. BERMAN FINANCE CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT. YES GOOD MORNING CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WOULD NOT BE IN VIOLATION OF ANY PAGO LAW- GIVEN THAT IT WILL BE RETROACTIVE THE EMPLOYER STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO PAY FOR AND CORRECTS- TO ADDRESS THOSE- DOES BY RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS- PRIOR TO THE- FIRE TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS BILL SO THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT ACTION IT'S ONLY IF THAT EMPLOYER CHOOSES TO NOT ADDRESS THAT ACTION- THAT. THEY WOULD BE IN VIOLATION. WOULD YOU MIND. TELLING ME WHERETHAT'S IN THE BILL I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE BILL I CAN'T FIND THAT LANGUAGE ANYWHERE THAT SAYS THAT EMPLOYERS WOULD NOT BE PUNITIVE BE PUNISHED FOR RETROACTIVELY PAIN THOSE PAYMENTS- SO IF YOU COULD POINT THAT OUT TO ME I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT I'M SORRY I MISSED IT- YES- I BELIEVE THAT SECTION- TO FORTY EIGHT. POINT TWO LITTLE E. PARAGRAPH TWO SUBPARAGRAPH C. OKAY AS I LOOK FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION- WILL THAT ALSO COVERS THE INACCURATE WAIT% STATEMENT FOR THE EMPLOYEE WAS NOT AND PAID THE CORRECT WAGES ON THEIR WEIGHT STATEMENT WHICH CREATES IF A CIVIL PENALTY IN A- IN A PENALTY FOR- WAGES AS WELL FOR NOT HAVING AN ACCURATE WAGE STATEMENTS ISSUED TO THOSE EMPLOYEES. AND UNDER CURRENT LAW AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO RETROACTIVELY OBJECT EVERY PAGE EVERY WAIT STATEMENT TO EVERY EMPLOYEE AND RE MAIL THEM A COPY OF AN ADJUSTED PAYSTUB WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION SHOWING THE TWO WEEKS PAID. AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAIL THAT WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD DOES THAT STILL APPLY UNDER THIS. SO I BELIEVE THERE'S A PROVISION IN THERE THAT ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE- THOSE PAY STATEMENTS- FOR EMPLOYERS I DON'T HAVE THE CITATION ON HAND- BUT DEUCE BUT DO NOTE THAT- THAT THERE IS A PROVISION IN THERE THAT PROFILES PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYERS TO ADDRESS THOSE PAY STATEMENTS. OKAY M. JUST ANOTHER QUESTION ON THE FOLLOW UP SO I AM LOOKING FOR A STATUS CODE SECTION THAT YOU JUST CITED AND I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT PAGE AND WHAT LINE ITEM THAT IS ON YOUR BILL. IS SIXTEEN PAGES I'M TRYING TO GO THROUGH IT. RAPIDA I DON'T HAVE THAT PAGE REFERENCE IN FRONT OF ME. THE TECHNICIAN MINUTES TO FIND IT. SURE I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP. I THINK I'M SENATOR GROW HOW ABOUT WILL LET'S GO WILL RETURN TO YOU WHILE HE LOOKS FOR THE PAGE NUMBER OKAY AND WE'LL GET SOME OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS HAVE I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION OKAY AND WHAT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE IT'S NOT RELATED TO THAT SPECIFIC WORDING. IN THE PREVIOUS BILL AND THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL M. IN A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL IT WAS EIGHTY HOURS PER CALENDAR YEAR AND THIS IS EIGHTY HOURS- BUT IT DOESN'T SAY. IT'S NOT IS IT IT IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION IT WAS DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED THAT YOU COULD ONLY USE THE EIGHTY HOURS OF SICKLY FOR COVERT IN A ONE TIME- IN ONE TIME LIKE FOURTEEN DAYS WITH A TICKET FOR DAYS THREE DAYS TWO DAYS WHATEVER TO TAKE CAE OF A FAMILY MEMBER. IT WAS A TOTAL OF FOURTEEN DAYS OR EIGHTY HOURS. THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE IT A TOTAL OF EIGHTY HOURS IN THE LANGUAGE AND I REALIZE IT'S OVER IN SEPTEMBER BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE A TOTAL HOURS. IN THE LANGUAGE SO I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT AND THEN GO BACK TO MY PREVIOUS QUESTION- ON WHERE IT'S AT THE LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE RETROACTIVITY AND THAT THE PENALIZING OF EMPLOYERS I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YEAH CHRIS COOK WITH FINANCE AGAIN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT DOES PROVIDE UP TO EIGHTY HOURS- I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IT NOT BEING- NOT ALLOWING FOR EIGHTY HOURS. SO IT IT IT IT SHOULD ALLOW FOR UP TO EIGHTY HOURS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE. SO IT'S NOT UP TO EIGHTY HOURS AND THAT WAS MY QUESTION I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING AND MORE EXPLICIT- AND- IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL. IT SAID IT WAS A- EIGHTY HOURS MAXIMUM BASICALLY DIDN'T USE THE WORD MAXIMUM I CAN PULL IT OUT. OF EIGHTY HOURS IN A CALENDAR YEAR THERE'S A PREVIOUS VERSION. THIS IS EIGHTY HOURS BUT IT DOESN'T SAY MAXIMUM SO MY QUESTION IS WILL DEPLOY YEARS. AND BE REQUIRED TO PAY EIGHTY HOURS AND THEN THIRTY DAYS LATER PAID. AND ANOTHER TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS LATER BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER THAT'S ILL PAY ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO MAXIMUM IN THIS VERSION OF THE BILL THAT I CAN FIND AND AGAIN I JUST GOT THE LANGUAGE I THINK IT WAS. LATE SUNDAY NIGHT LAST NIGHT SO- BECAUSE IT I THINK IT WENT IN FRIDAY AND WAS AMENDED ON SATURDAY AND I GOT IT SUNDAY- SO I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO COMPLETELY DIGEST EACH LABOR CODE BUT IF YOU WOULD JUST POINT THAT OUT TO ME SO I CAN BE SURE. THAT EMPLOYERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE. REQUIRED TO PAY MULTIPLE FOURTEEN DAY PERIODS OR MULTIPLE TIME FRAMES. AND THEN ALSO THE RETROACTIVITY ISSUE THAT I ADDRESSED EARLIER TELL ME THE CODE SECTION. AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SCENE- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. BUT IN THE REAL WORLD EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE CAN'T OPERATE ON YOUR UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE TO OPERATE ON THE EXACT LANGUAGE. THAT IS IN THIS BILL AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD JUST- COVER THE SUBJECT MATTERS FOR ME. THANK YOU. RIGHT SO AGAIN CHRIS WITH FINANCE- NO IT DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY HOURS IT'S ONLY EIGHTY HOURS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. SO FROM JANUARY TO SEPTEMBER EIGHTY HOURS TOTAL. AGAIN CAN YOU SHOW ME WHERE THAT IS IN THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION BUT I CAN'T FIND IT IN THIS VERSION. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT REFERENCE I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK. AT THE CODE SECTION TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT SECTION THAT IS REFERENCING. OKAY THANK YOU. IF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REFINES THE CODE SECTION WE CAN RETURN. LET SARAH KEEP GOING WITH OUR- QUESTIONS REMEMBER SENATOR DRAWS ARE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I PARTIALLY IS LIKE A COMMENT ON THE QUESTION- OBVIOUSLY IT WON'T APPLY THE ACTION FOR. THE NUMBER OF WORKERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE COVERED I THINK THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. BE PART OF SOLVING AND STOPPING THE SPREAD OF KOBE NINETEEN- IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND HAVING THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE TIME AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GONNA LOSE PAY. IS PART OF THE DECISION THAT A WORKING PERSON MAKES ARE TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THAT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US AND SO I THINK IT'S- REALLY GOOD THAT WE'RE TAKING THAT ONE- ACTION. HOWEVER I. LARGE EXEMPTION OF THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS WHO WILL HAVE WHICH IS UNDER TWENTY FIVE. EMPLOYEES I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S UP TO FOUR MILLION WORKERS THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THE PAID SICK LEAVE UNDER THE THRESHOLD OF THIS BILL- SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE GETTING A LOT OF ASSISTANCE AND I'VE SUPPORTED THAT VERY ACTIVELY- WE RECENTLY OF FUNDED TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE HAD PROVIDED. EARLIER RELIEF I SUPPORT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME THAT. THEY NEED- AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS- THEY USUALLY ALL ARE OF LOW WAGE WORKERS- WITH EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE- THERE ARE- COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WORKERS THEIR- FRONTLINE WORKERS AND TO EXCLUDE THEM. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY PUBLIC HEALTH SENSE TO ME- SO I. ALWAYS MAKING THAT COMMENT WITH- GREAT CONCERN OVER THOSE- MILLIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE AND WIDE TO THE CUT OFF FOR THE THRESHOLD AT- TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR LESS. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- THE TWENTY FIVE OR BELOW THE THRESHOLD WAS WAS REALLY TO STRIKE A BALANCE- PROVIDING SICK LEAVE FOR- SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL NOT IMPOSING ANY ADDITIONAL HARDSHIPS AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU'VE NOTED- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF- RESOURCES PROVIDED TO SMALL BUSINESSES I THINK YOU IN THE CHAIR BOTH NOTED THE TWO POINT ONE BILLION. FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW THERE IS THAT FEDERAL- LAW DOES STATE THAT THIS IS STILL OPTIONAL AND SO- IF THEY SO CHOOSE WHICH OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ENCOURAGING THEM TO DO SO- TO PROVIDE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- THAT. VERY GENEROUS I TAX CREDIT THAT THEY CANNOT RECEIVE. LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS YES- SENATOR MAN GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU- HAVE TAKEN PHYSICISTS I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL I FOLLOWED IT. LOSI IT'S BEEN A TOUGH ONE FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD FROM A LOT OF BUSINESSES PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY COMMUNITY. BETTER REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW MANY SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED. IT IS OBVIOUSLY TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE ARE ALSO MANY MANY WORKERS THAT ARE BARELY GETTING BY AS WELL. AND THE LAST THING WE WANT WORKERS TO BE WORRYING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS MISSING PAYCHECKS PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE- OR POTENTIALLY LOSING THEIR JOBS. BECAUSE THEY GOT SICK WOULD COVER NINETEEN WHETHER ON THE JOB OR ELSEWHERE- WE HAVE ISSUES OF ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AS MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ALSO POINTED OUT. MANY OF THESE WORKERS ARE LOW WAGE THERE PEOPLE OF COLOR- THIS IS ALSO ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK WITH COVERT COMING INTO WORK- SO I KNOW A LOT OF HARD WORK WENT INTO THIS. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS JUST- YOU KNOW I. AM I THINK HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE- DIFFERENT. ACTIONS THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES TAKEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TAKING. THESE BUSINESSES ARE GETTING A LOT OF RELIEF- TO HELP COVER. SOME OF THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS BUT- I'D BE CURIOUS IF- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MIGHT ELABORATE- TO WHAT DEGREE WILL THIS ALL BE COVERED UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE. PROGRAMS AND FUNDING. THE PURPOSE I NEED TO GO AHEAD I THINK YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN THE- FACT THAT THESE TAX CREDITS BASICALLY COVER THE EMPLOYERS COSTS BUT GO AHEAD. YES ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU TERRY- SENTIMENT YES THE SMALL BUSINESSES- IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO PROVIDED BELOW TWENTY FIVE IN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESSES OVER THAT. THEY DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS AND GET A PRETTY GENEROUS CREDIT- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A ONE TO ONE- SO. THAT FEDERAL LAW DOES COMPENSATE THEM FOR THIS LEAVE THAT IS TAKEN AND ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD IS. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY LOW LOCALS ARE ALSO PROVIDING OUR HAVE EXTENDED THE BASICALLY THAT WAS- ENACTED EARLIER THIS YEAR UNDER AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN- I BELIEVE L. A. SAN JOSE OAKLAND- TO NAME A FEW- THIS THIS LEGISLATION REALLY PROVIDES- SENT STATEWIDE- GARDENS AND- CLARITY. THIS IS THE SHOULD BE APPLIED UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE STATE SO- AGAIN MANY LOCALS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE THE SICKLY EVEN THIS IS JUST PROVIDING THAT UNIFORM GUIDANCE GOT STATE. AND SUGGESTED THAT I HEARD CORRECTLY COVERS ONE TO ONE SO THERE IS NO HARM TO BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE THIS SICK LEAVE. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE- I HAD ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION I THINK WE'RE SO CLOSE TO SEEING THE END OF THIS. PANDEMIC AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT HIS COMPANY TO. BUT ONE OF THE KEYS IS GOING TO BE VACCINATIONS AND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT VACCINATION ROLLOUT. ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS AROUND TAKE UP AND THOSE WHO INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NOT BE WILLING FOR SOME REASON TO TAKE THE VACCINE- IN I GUESS I'D I KNOW I KNOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN. HARD COPY THE HARD NEGOTIATED AND IT'S IN A LATE POINT AND SO I DON'T. WANT TO PUSH AMENDMENTS TO THIS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT THINGS GOING FORWARD- IT WOULD HAVE STRUCK ME AS A GOOD IDEA TO CONSIDER REQUIRING VACCINATIONS FOR ANY EMPLOYEE OR WORKER THAT- OR AN EXCUSE IF THEY WANT TO OPT OUT BUT BUT SOME. VALID REASON FOR A WORKER-TO NOT GET VACCINATED BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING VACCINATIONS THAT'S GONNA BE KEY FOR US GETTING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER A- DR PAN SENATOR SAM YES THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND AGAIN- FREESHEET THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS BILL AND CERTAINLY FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT ONE BE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK ESPECIALLY PEOPLE CODE WHICH IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY- ISOLATE. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY TEST PEOPLE AND- EVEN CONTACT TRACE THEM TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEY EXPOSED BUT ALSO IF THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED OR SYMPTOMATIC OR- ARE ASYMPTOMATIC AND TRYING TO FIRESTEEL STAY HOME SO- TO HELP PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE WHICH ALSO IF IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD. NOW AS IT SPREAD CERTAINLY- THEN DISCOURAGES PEOPLEFROM BEING ABLE TO DO WORK OR- SHOPPER DO WHATEVER OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO HELP SUPPORT BUSINESS. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT- HI IN RELATION TO NOT ONLY FOR WHAT WOULD BE ON SO WE BASICALLY BUDGET A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR- STAFFING RESOURCE LABOR COMMISSIONER WHICH MAKES SENSE BUT- TO WHAT DEGREE ARE WE ACTUALLY INFORMING SMALL BUSINESSES THEMSELVES- THAT EIGHT. OF THE SPECIFICS OF NOT ONLY THIS BILL BUT ALSO OF OUR PREVIOUS ACTIONS EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND- THE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DOING BECAUSE- I MEAN I DO HEARINGS ARE YOU FROM SMALL BUSINESSES BUT I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE- ACTED INFORMATION AND YOUR EMPLOYER. THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO GET YOUR TAX CREDITS OVER THE VEIL ABILITY SOMETIMES- PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AS AWARE AS WHEN I THINK THEY ARE HERE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT SPENDING THE YOU KNOW THIS MORNING DISCUSSING THIS BILL AND- AND THE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT- WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO RUN YOUR SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT MISLEADING ATTENTION WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE OTHERS IN THIS ROOM ARE. ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE SO WHAT ARE WE DOING IN TERMS OF. GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS MANY OF WHOM ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SMALLER BUSINESS. YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET HR UPDATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO JUST RUN YOUR BUSINESS AND- AS OF ANYTHING THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S NORMAL WHICH IS EVEN CREE COVE IN TERMS OF HOW- WHAT KIND OF TAX CREDITS AND THINGS TO GET YOU MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THAT AWARE OF. SO ARE WE DOING TO EDUCATE SMALL BUSINESS CENTER SO THEY THEY KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROVIDE THEM THE KIND OF SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO THAT. AND AND SO THEY'RE NOT SO ANXIOUS ABOUT. THESE REQUIREMENTS THAT- THAT WE'RE NOT. DOING AND IF THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S HELP AVAILABLE. BERMAN FOR. WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH I I'D HAVE SENATOR PAN THANK YOU FOR QUESTION I I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFIC- OUT REACH EFFORTS THAT- THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE MAY BE PROVIDING BY I DO KNOW THAT THEY THEY PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES WITH FAN CLUB AND- YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL- SPECIFICS ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE AS THEY DID WITH AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN- SO I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR SIMILARLY THE CASE WITH THIS- LEGISLATION AS WELL THAT HE PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS- BUSINESSES NEED TO COMPLY WITH ACCESS I POINT OUT THAT MY FAMILY WERE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHEN I'VE GOTTEN A NOTICE. AND I KNOW BECAUSE I'M HERE. SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO BE VERY PROACTIVE ABOUT THAT AND IN SOME SENSES A WONDER YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER BUDGET ITEM TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO YOU SO FOR EXAMPLE IS EDT SENDING A NOTICE TO EVERY EMPLOYER. THAT SAYING WITH A SHEET THAT SAYS THIS IS WHAT- IF YOU HAVE A PAYROLL COMPANY IS THERE A DAY SENDING A DAY ASKING THEM TO SEND OUT A GUIDANCE SHE TO SAY THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN AVAIL YOURSELF OF NOW HERE'S- INDOOR TO GET SUPPORT- AND NOTIFICATION OF THAT. SORT SO I THINK SOME MORE SPECIFICS WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO AND I SEE AND- AGAIN PROCEED ALL THE WORK THAT'S GOING INTO THIS BUT IF. ON THE FRONT LINES FOR MANAGING PAYROLLS. THE CUTTING PAYROLL CHECKS DON'T KNOW THEN THAT'S WHERE WE GET PROBLEMS RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO GIVE THE LEAVES WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE OUR BOOKS AND WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE HELP IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THEIR VAN YOU KNOW THEN THAT DAY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE KIND ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE TO BE I THINK WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB EDUCATING THEM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE YOU RESPOND. SO THE E. TAX CREDITS FOR THIS PAID SICK LEAVE. THAT WE ARE IN EFFECT EXTENDING NOW. WERE IN EFFECT SINCE THE FIRST FEDERAL CARE SECTORS THAT CORRECT. THE TAX CREDIT WAS IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE FAMILY FIRST ACROBATICS RELIEF ACT SO. WHAT NINE WHICH WHICH TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY- I BELIEVE FAMILY FIRST WAS ENACTED OUR EARLY ON I WANNA SAY AROUND MARCH AND APRIL SO IN OTHER WORDS EMPLOYERS. HAVE AND PAYCHECK COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THESE PROVISIONS WERE IN EFFECT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY. WELL ALL OF THEM DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DO AS RESULT AND NOT MINIMIZING THAT IT'S BENEFICIAL TO INFORM THEM I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT THIS IS NOT- WE'RE WE'RE NOT CREATING A WHOLLY NEW PROVISION. SOME SENATOR PAN MANAGER AT EVERY SEAT THAT AND I DO UNDERSTAND I DO THINK THAT ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER TO BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW WERE I REALIZE THAT WE HAVE A CUT OFF YOUR FOR TWENTY FIVE AND UNDER WHICH I KNOW THAT- SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT- WE ALSO WANT TO CURSE THEM THE SMALLER THE COMPANY YOU ARE THE LESS LIKELY SO NO ONE'S WITH HR DEPARTMENTS REACTION OF A PERSON IS ASSIGNED TO DO THAT IF YOU ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE OWNER. OR ONE OF THEIR SENIOR STAFF IS DOING HR AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT INFORMATION THEY'RE GETTING- SO IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE- AND THIS IS MORE EXTENSION SO I REALIZE I'M RAISING THIS IN RELATION TO THIS BILL FOR SOMETHING THAT WERE. TRYING TO EXTEND. I THINK WE COULD PERHAPS DO A BETTER JOB IN TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO- UNFORTUNATELY MAY NOT BE IS AWARE THAT. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE HEALTH AND TRYING TO PROVIDE SICK LEAVE SITE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES- SO. I AM JUST THINKING HOPING THAT WE CAN GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO COMMUNICATE TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS PERHAPS. THROUGH ETFS OR THROUGH- EASY FOR ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS THE FILE PAYROLL REPORTS WHAT KIND OF NOTIFICATIONS THEY'VE BEEN SENT DIRECTLY. ABOUT TO TEXAS HELP THEY CAN GET NOW PROVIDING. A SICKLY. CENTERVILLE'S THEN SENATOR MULLIN. A MADAM CHAIR AS I THIS IS A PROCEDURAL CONCERNED INACTIVE GET ON THE RECORD. THE MAJORITY STAFF WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH THE MINORITY STAFF TO GETTING THE INFORMATION OF THE AMENDMENTS SO THAT WE COULD ANALYZE AND TO THE MEMBERS. ARE UPDATED PROPERLY. BUT THERE ARE- TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION. AND THEY PROBABLY HAVE THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS. AND THAT THIS HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND I WOULD ARGUE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WHICH PERSON. PURPOSEFUL BUT THAT IT. PRECLUDED THEM FROM THE NAY OPPORTUNITY RIGHTEOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE. WHATEVER THE AMENDMENTS ARE AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THEM INDIVIDUALLY. SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT INJUSTICE FOR SOMETHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE AND I LIST A LIKE TO LIKE LIVE CHAT IS A CONCERN ON THE RECORD. CERTAINLY I- THERE WAS A REFERENCE BEFORE THAT THIS A- WAS NOT OPEN UNTIL THE WEEKEND IN FACT I MEAN IF YOU'RE CONCERNS MAY STILL- BE THERE HOWEVER IT WAS IN FRENCH FOUR PM FRIDAY JUST JUST CLARIFYING WHEN THE BILL WAS IN PRINT. CENTER MELINDA'S. M. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR APPROPRIATION TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IN ORDER TO ENFORCE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND HOW THAT NUMBER WAS ARRIVED UPON BECAUSE WINDER STAND THAT THESE TYPES OF BILL MUST HAVE A BUDGET APPROPRIATION AND THEM THIS HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS- A SEEMS A LITTLE RANDOM A AND B. I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST AND- IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE- IT WOULD EVEN BE ENOUGH IF THEY REALLY WANNA. GO OUT AND FORCES SO CAN SOMEONE ANSWER PLEASE HOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS THE NUMBER THAT WAS LANDED UPON. BERMAN FINANCE. YES SENATOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE STAFFER IDEA HARD TO HELP COORDINATE AND TO- YOU KNOW AND- HELP YOU KNOW AS KNOW SOME OF THESE- THESE WERE FORCE- THESE WORKLOAD- KANNST SO REALLY IT'S JUST ONE ADDITION STAFF HELP YOU- KEEP- TELL THE DRESS SOMEBODY'S CONCERN AS THEIR IN IN. CAN ROUTE THEM TO THE STAFF D. A. R. OKAY THING YOU SO- YOU YOU WOULD BE HIRING AN ADDITIONAL PERSON TO OVERSEE THIS EFFORT OR- SOMEBODY ALREADY HAVE. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE HIRING BY A WOULD IT BE ONE PERSON WHETHER THAT'S- SOMEONE THAT'S BEING REDIRECTED INTERNAL OR NEW HIRE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU WHAT C. ADDITIONAL QUESTION SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE I MAY HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES RESPOND TO MY COLLEAGUE AT IRVINE MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RESPOND- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT IS A IT WAS A ONE TO ONE REIMBURSEMENT- DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY TAX CREDIT. BERMAN FINANCE GO AHEAD. YES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A ONE TO ONE TAX CREDIT. FOR SMALL BUSINESSES WHO. UTILIZE THE ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES WHO USE THE SUPPLEMENTAL BASICALLY. OKAY WELL THAT SAID I'M NOT THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE FEDERAL PLAN CLEARLY SAYS THAT THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR A DAY CAP IN SOME CASES AND DEPENDING ON WHICH IS A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP IN OTHERS. SO ANYBODY OVER MAKING TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR WOULD NOT BE A ONE TO ONE REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON THE FEDERAL PLANNED IT THAT WAS JUST SIGNED BY THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. IS THAT NOT CORRECT IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE A CAP. YES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES AS A CAP IS FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS A DAY AND A MAXIMUM OF. FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. CAP SO IF AN EMPLOYER PAYS AN EMPLOYEE OVER TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR EVEN IF THEY ARE SMALL BUSINESS THERE WOULD NOT BE A ONE TO ONE REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS IS THAT CLEAR IS THAT CORRECT IT WOULD BE A ONE TO ONE MATCH UP TO THE CAP TO THE CAP OKAY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD- AND DID A FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION FROM IRVINE. THANK YOU. SEPTIC CERTAINLY. ALL RIGHT LET ME SEE. OKAY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GO SENATOR MELENDEZ. SENATOR MELENDEZ GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT WAS JUST STATED SO IT'S A ONE TO ONE MATCH UP TO THE CAP WHICH MEANS. THAT'S THIRDS UP TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS ARE UP TO. FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN HUNDRED BERMAN FINANCED YOU WANNA DRESS THAT. YES FIVE THE CAP IS FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS A DAY. FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE- IN TOTALITY AND I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE IN ADDITION TO THE MATCH WITH THE CAT THE FEDERAL CAP OR THAT TAX CREDIT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL SMALL BUSINESS PACKAGES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES PROVIDE RELIEF INCLUDING THE TWO POINT ONE BILLION FOR. THOSE GRANTS IN ADDITION TO THE DEAL THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS FOR- THE PAYCHECK PROTECT PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM SO IN ADDITION TO THAT TAX CREDIT ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAVE A CAP CALIFORNIA IS ALSO PROVIDING SMALL BUSINESSES MANY RESOURCES. ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURES OF CODE. OKAY SO THANK YOU I JUST I THINK THERE'S SOME DISCREPANCY HERE AS TO WHAT THE CAP WAS IN WHAT IS- WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD HERE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S- OUT AND- NOT GOING TO COVER ALL THE COSTS IN- IN MANY CASES. SO- THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE. FIVE WHY DON'T WE NOW SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS OF A BILL. ANYONE IN THIS HEARING ROOM SEEING NINE IS THERE ANYONE IN OUR OF A. AUXILIARY ROOM SEEING NINE- THE MODERATOR CAN YOU QUEUE UP THE PHONE LINES TO SEE WHETHER THERE'S ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND THAT PHONE LINE NUMBER IS.

WITH THE- YOU'RE RIGHT I WAS WAITING UNTIL THE LAST BILL PRESENTATION APOLOGIES I'M SO USED TO JUST GETTING TO- TESTIMONY RIGHT AFTER THE BILL SO YOU'RE RIGHT I'M GOING TO. GET ON TO OUR FLOOR THE DISCUSSION ON THE NEXT BILL BUT BEFORE YOU DO WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THIS- PAIDSICK LEAVE- WELL I APPRECIATE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES- EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN. I THINK THAT ALL OF US SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED IF EMPLOYEES SHOW UP AT WORK WITH KOBE. WE ARE TRYING TO STOP THIS PANDEMIC AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD IF PEOPLE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES ONE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES TELL US. THEY TELL US IF. WE SUSPECT WE HAVE CODED. TO STAY HOME. I DO NOT WANT TO GET CODED I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE GOING OUT TO WORK. THE ONLY WAY MANY MANY PEOPLE CAN AVOID GOING TO WORK IS IF THEY DO NOT LOSE THEIR PAYCHECK SO I AM HIGHLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MAKING THIS CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE. AND AS THEY DID LAST YEAR. AND I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO GO TO SEPTEMBER BECAUSE I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL HAVE. THIS PANDEMIC CONTAIN BY THEN BUT WE WILL NOT IF PEOPLE. DEFY DO DO NOT FOLLOW THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT WAS GIVEN. IF PEOPLE EITHER ARE NOT VACCINATED OR ARE OUT AND ABOUT IN WORKING WITH KOBE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A PANDEMIC. ON OUR HANDS WHICH WE ARE ALL. DESK TO CONTAIN SO I GREET APPRECIATE THIS AND I HOPE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES WHILE WE'RE NOT MANDATING THEM TO DO SO WITH THIS BILL I HOPE THAT THEY WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE.

ALREADY MANDATE THAT ANY EMPLOYEE WITH BECAUSE THE NINETEEN OR WHO HAS BEEN EXPOSED THAT WORK MUST BE OUT FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN DAYS BEFORE PAID BENEFITS AND FULL BENEFIT. MOST CONCERNING IS A PROVISION MAKING THAT FREE OF OBLIGATION RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY FIRST IN A TIME WHEN EMPLOYERS ARE CAREFULLY PLANNING HOW THEY WILL SPEND EVERY PENNY TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE AND ENSURE THEY CAN COVER PAYROLL AN EMPLOYER COULD BE INUNDATED WITH REQUESTS FOR A RETROACTIVE PAYMENT. FURTHER THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS WILL NOT COVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE COST MOST OF THE QUALIFYING REASONS ARE CAPPED THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW HAS A CAP OF. FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS PER DAY FOR EVERY QUALIFYING. RETROACTIVE THAT. IS ALSO A MASSIVE. BURDEN IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW AN EMPLOYEE REGRET. THIS WATER THE CITY. WHERE AN EMPLOYEE WITHOUT IN JANUARY AND YOU PGO SICK LEAVE OR VACATION ANDNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE OWED RETROACTIVELY UNDER THE BELT. ANY ERROR WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PAGA PENALTIES. FINALLY THE RETROACTIVITY PROVISION RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY ANY EMPLOYEE OR FORMER EMPLOYEE WHO BELIEVES THERE NOW- BRIDGES FROM JANUARY FEBRUARY OR EARLY MARCH.

IF THERE IS NO OTHER DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR CENTER NIELSEN YOU DO WANNA MAKE COMMENT GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD SATURDAY ALSO. A THE MANAGER I'D LIKE TO JUST. RESTATE THE OBJECTION I MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THAT TESTIFIED. THEY DO NOT MATCH THE FULL LIST OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OPPOSED OR ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE PUBLISHED MY POINT IS THAT THEY'VE GT BEEN BLINDSIDED WITH THIS WEEKEND DEAL. WHERE THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY RALLY THE TROOPS. AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE JOINT OPINION OF THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS. LOL THIS BILL ACTUALLY- PERCH SOME BUSINESSES THAT DIED DEFINING. WHAT AID FOR AN EMPLOYEE DOES NOT INCLUDE. THAT'S A RATHER INTERESTING PROVISION I WOULD STATE MILDLY AND I KNOW WHAT IT'S PURPOSES AND YOU TO. I THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR THIS LEGISLATURE GRIEF AFFECTING SO MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. IT'S SUCH A SHABBY MANNER. SO I DO OBJECT TO THIS ON THE RIGHT. THE PART DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT TO THAT. YOU SEE THE HAND UP FUNCTION GO AHEAD. EIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO RESPOND BACK TO SENATOR GROVES EARLIER QUESTION FOR THE CITATIONS FOR HER QUESTIONS OKAY BE TO FOLLOW UP WITH STAFF AFTER PROVIDED NOW WHATEVER IS EASIEST. ARE YOU COULD DO SO NOW. THANK YOU SO SENATOR GROW TO YOUR QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO THE EIGHTY HOURS- LIMIT. THAT IS IN SECTOR SECTION TO FORTY EIGHT POINT TWO. LITTLE BE. TOO BIG A- AND THEN FOR YOUR CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO THE PAGA ENFORCEMENT- THAT IS IN THE SAME SECTION TO FORTY EIGHT POINT TWO LITTLE EASY. TO BIG DAY THERE'S A SECTION ON THE RETROACTIVITY AND THE COMPLIANCE THERE AND I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THAT WITH THAT YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE THOSE CITATIONS IN WRITING. THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR POINTING THAT OUT ALL START LOOKING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW IN THE MEANTIME COULD YOU JUST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU WHAT YOUR INTERPRETATION THAT IS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF POSSIBLE IS THAT- I'M JUST GONNA SAY WHEN THIS BILL PASSES BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO PASS. AND WHEN THIS BILL PASSES IF AN EMPLOYEE SAYS HEY BACK IN JANUARY. I HAD CO BETTER MY MOM HAD COVE IT. AND I WANT TO BE. PAID FOR THAT TWO WEEKS OR THAT EIGHTY HOURS- FIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY- MAY NOT HAVE TAKEN THE WHOLE TIME OFF I DON'T I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S JUST PAID SICK LEAVE WHETHER THEY TOOK THE TIME OR NOT. BECAUSE IT'S RETROACTIVE. IF THE IF THEY DO USE THAT. IN THE EMPLOYEE GETS PAID EVERY TWO WEEKS AND THAT PAY PERIOD FALLS THE NEXT PAY PERIOD FALLS IN. APRIL WHICH IT VERY WELL MAY BE. IS THERE ANY. OF TI'S ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACCURATE WAGE STATEMENTS LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TWO SIX ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WITH THIS BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYER TO PAY PENALTIES AND BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES AND FINES. FOR NOT PAYING THAT TWO WEEKSWHEN THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY TOOK THE TIME OFF BACK IN JANUARY. BECAUSE IT WASN'T REQUIRED TO BE PAID. UNDER THIS BILL THAT TAKES EFFECT IN APRIL OR MARCH THAT MAKES SENSE. YES OKAY SO TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION SENATOR THAT THERE IS NO PENALTIES AGAIN ONLY IF. THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T ROOM- ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND SO. IF THEY WERE TO TAKE THE LEAVE. BACK PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL AND NOW WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THIS BILL THEY CLAIM THAT THAT TIME WAS TAKEN SPECIFICALLY FOR CULTIVATED. THEN THE EMPLOYER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO THEN PROVIDE THAT LEAVE FOR THEM RETROACTIVELY ONLY IN THE CASE WHERE THEY DON'T. PROVIDE THAT THEN ENFORCEMENT WOULD TAKE AFFECT AND HERE EARLIER QUESTION ON THE EXPLANATION FOR THE EIGHTY HOURS IT'S MY IT'S AS I STATED THAT THE SECTION SPECIFICALLY SAYS EIGHTY HOURS FOR THE ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. UNDER THAT SECTION. AND FOR THAT THE OTHER- CONCERNS WITH THE RETROACTIVITY- QUICKLY LOOKING AT THAT NOW- THAT SECTION IT SPECIFIES FOR ANY FOR ANY SEXUALLY TAKEN IF THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT COMPENSATE IN THE FULL AMOUNT EQUAL OR GREATER TO THE AMOUNT OF. THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE. THEN- THE EMPLOYER SHALL. THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING THEM THAT RETROACTIVITY PAYMENT AND SO IF THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THAT THEN THE ENFORCEMENT DOES TAKE EFFECT. IS THERE A DISPUTE MECHANISM WHAT IF THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY TOOK THE COVERT LEAVE FOR COVERT SITUATIONS IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THERE WAS A DISPUTE WITH THE EMPLOYER. I MEAN THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER HAD TO SAY LOOK HE'S BEEN EXPOSED- HE SHE'S BEEN EXPOSED TO COLLUDED- AND SHOULD THEREFORE QUARANTINE- IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT'S A DISPUTE OR DUE PROCESS FOR THE EMPLOYER OR IS IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY ON DEMAND FOR ANYBODY THAT SAYS. THAT THE- WANT THAT TIME OFF YES SO THIS DOESN'T THIS DOESN'T DIFFER FROM ANY OTHER SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A NOTIFICATION ALTHOUGH- ONE MAY BE. ONE MAY BE ASKED FOR THE- THE INPUT FROM THE EMPLOYEE- IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THAT BUT- THIS IS THE COMPLIANCE OR THE ENFORCEMENT AS IT IS SIMILAR TO EXISTING PAID SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS. OKAY SO THERE IS NO ABILITY TO ASK BECAUSE THAT'S- I BELIEVE A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW FOR- HIT BACK IF THEY CAN'T SIMPLE YEAH OKAY SO THERE'S NO ABILITY ASK. AND THEN- DID YOU WORRY I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO THOSE QUESTIONS WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ON THE ONE TO ONE MATCH. BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I KNOW THE STATE HAS A FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN DOLLAR CAP- OR A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND WHATEVER. AT BUT THIS FEDERAL BILL SAYS TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MOST CASES OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN DOLLAR DIFFERENCE WOULD COME FROM THE EMPLOYER WITHOUT A TAX REIMBURSEMENT. CORRECT OR NOT- I'M SORRY I'M NOT I'M NOT AWARE OF THE DISCREPANCY THE FACT THAT CAPS THAT WE DECIDED BEFORE AND I'M- I BELIEVE I SAID REFLECT TENANTS IT'S FIVE ELEVEN SO POLICIES. BY THE- THEY SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S IN THE FEDERAL BILL. THEY SHOULD BE OKAY THEY ARE COULD THEY ARGUED THAT THE CALORIE CONSISTENT WITH. THE FEDERAL BILL THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S SEE IF THERE ARE OTHER- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M GONNA DO NOW IS SEE IF WE HAVE- I WANT TO GO THROUGH THE BILLS IN THE ORDER THAT THEIR OWNER GENDA. SO WE'RE AB EIGHTY THREE THE LICENSE RENEWAL FEE CLEAN UP THAT ALLOWS FOR THE CRAFT BREWERS CRAFT DISTILLERS A FEW OTHERS.
