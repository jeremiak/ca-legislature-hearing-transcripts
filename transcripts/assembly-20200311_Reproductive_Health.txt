AND HOPEFULLY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL JOIN US WHEN THEY HEAR US ON THEIR SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL- THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IN OUR COUNTRY CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT ATTACKS FROM BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHO SEEK TO LIMIT RESTRICT AND DEPRIVE INDIVIDUALS METONYMY OR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. I AM PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH CONTINUES TO WORK TOWARDS EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE CARE. I'M ALSO INCREDIBLY PROUD TO BE A CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOCUSED ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION AND WHEN THEY CONTINUES TO DO WORK TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA'S WORK TO BE REFLECTIVE HEALTHCARE STATE FOR ALL. AND I LAST LIKE MANY HEARING WE BEGAN THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE LANDSCAPE OF ACCESS. TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN AND MEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND HEARD ABOUT THE GROWING VOID AND BARRIERS TO CARE. THOSE BARRIERS RANGED FROM ACCESS FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. GROWING SECURITY CONCERNS FEDERAL POLICIES THAT SEEKS TO DECIMATE COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS CULTURAL COMPETENCY. ONE AREA WE DISCUSSED IN THAT HEARING. WAS IT IMPACTED IN I LIVE CARE WE ARE HAVING ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OUR HEARING TODAY INTENDS TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE AND PRODUCE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF THESE DENIALS. SPECIFICALLY WE WILL LOOK AT BARRIERS TO CARE THAT HAVE RESULTED FROM A LEGEND BASED HEALTH CARE REFUSALS. FOR TODAY'S HEARING WE'VE GATHERED AN INCREDIBLE GROUP OF EXPERT PANELISTS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE FOR BEING HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH BASS. THEY WILL PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND HOW RELIGIOUS BASED HEALTH CARE FUELS ARE IMPACTING CALIFORNIANS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HHS ISSUED SWEEPING REGULATIONS. CREATED TO. CREATE AND CREATED A SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT OFTEN JUST TO PROTECT. THE ABILITY OF INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS TO DENY CARE BASED ON RELIGION. THIS REFUSAL OF CARE RULE DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT PATIENT HEALTH CARE AND IS DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE IN LGBTQ INDIVIDUALS. ALREADY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS USE THIS RULE TO GO AFTER CALIFORNIA THREATENING OUR STATE TO TAKE AWAY FEDERAL HEALTH CARE FUNDING BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE ABORTION AS BASIC HEALTH CARE. WE ARE STANDING STRONG AND TRYING TO PROTECT OUR EXISTING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND OUR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT PATIENTS. ADDITIONALLY THIS COMMITTEE TODAY WILL EXAMINE WITH THE EXPANDING ROLE OF RELIGIOUSLY RESTRICTIVE HOSPITALS MEAN FOR THOSE SEEKING KAREN CALIFORNIA. WELL THESE HOSPITALS DO SOME INCREDIBLE WORK WE CAN'T IGNORE WHAT THEIR PREVALENCE IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM MEANS FOR COMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE JOINED US ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA AND ASK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS.

SHOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL BUT SADLY IT IS. I CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED THIS WHEN OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN I AUTHORED THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. HUNDREDS OF FAKE HEALTH CENTERS AROUND THE STATE. THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDING WOMEN WITH VERY MISLEADING AND INACCURATE CARE- TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING QUITE SIMILAR. AND THE FACT IN THE REALITY THAT THERE ARE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES AND HEALTH PROVIDERS. THAT ARE RESTRICTING AND LIMITING ACCESS TO VERY NECESSARY. AND COMPREHENSIVE CARE. BOB RIDLEY ON A RELIGIOUS BASE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR A LOT OF GOOD. TO WHAT WE TO DO TO MOVE FOR. I WANT TO MENTION THE YEAR. ALONG WITH OTHERS I GOING TO BE. FOR A BUDGET ASK A ONE TIME BUDGET ASKED TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

GOOD MORNING THANK YOU BROUGHT ME TO TESTIFY FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE- I REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A TRUE GENERAL'S A SENIOR ADVISER IN SPECIAL ASSISTANT- WELL AND I PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS SENIOR COUNSEL THE WOMEN'S POLICY. THE SENATE EDUCATION LABOR AND- PENSIONS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS- FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS THE UNITED STATES SENATE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDING SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION IS CRITICAL AND I'M HONORED TO SPEAK WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON THIS- INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT BARRIERS TO CARE. CITY CALIFORNIA HAS LONG PRIORITIZE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND FRAME THAT WORKS TO BALANCE ACCESS TO CARE IMPATIENCE RATES WITH CONSCIOUS PROTECTIONS. ARMY CALIFORNIA THIS HAS MEANT YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS PASSED SEVERAL LAWS- IN EFFECT TO PROTECT ACCESS TO ABORTION ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE CONTRACEPTIVES A PRACTICE LAW THE REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY. THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY ACT EXITS EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES- AND ALSO RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE LIES RIGHT WHICH ALLOW FOR THAT NO PLAYER SUMMER THIS. THE PROJECT IN A- EMPLOYER HAS FILED A WRITTEN STATEMENT. CAN YOU MORE ETHICAL REAL. BASIS FOR IF YOU PROJECT WHICH HAS A PAY. BUT BALANCING THE NEEDS THE PATIENT THAT THE OF CARE IS A INTER WITH AND THAT THERE ARE IN FROM EMERGENCY MISC. AND THEY HAVE BEEN AS THAT WILL HAD DISCUSSED THE HAVE BEEN A ARRAY OF A- ON REPEAT HEALTH THERE HAVE LONG BEEN RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION THE CHURCH SNOW AND- ON THIS FROM BECAUSE IT'S A FOR YOU. GET IN SO OF THIS THE FEDERAL HAS PRIOR TO USING REAL CON FLY TO HARM AND I CARE I MADE SECOND TWENTY NIGHTS DIMINISH FOR. RULE TO EXPAND SCOPE OF CON SAT ALLOWING VIRTUALLY ANYONE OF IN THE PROVISION OF CARE DENY HEALTH CARE REFUSE BY SERVICE. INCLUDING WITH IN LD IN THE- I ALLOW OUR OF SUCH TO QUE WOULD BECOME. TO IN STATE LAW IT'S A RULE THAT AGAIN TARGET TO SET A CAL IN IN A VERY TARGETED WAY. FOR THE ROLE WOULD HAVE CREATED IT CAN. ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE RIGHTS FEDERALLY AND HEADED CARE. SUCH AS MEDICAID MEDICARE WILL DISCOURAGING PROVIDERS FROM OFFERING SAFE LEGAL MEDICAL CARE FOR PATIENTS. THE RULE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY JUSTIFICATION NOTICE- REFERRAL BE GIVEN TO THE PATIENT WHO IS THE NIGHT CARE OR TO AN EMPLOYER WHO MUST NOW NAVIGATE THESE ACCOMMODATIONS IN REFUSALS- AND THEIR NO EXCEPTIONS FOR EMERGENCY. BIO LAWS PAULA RULE ITSELF CAN. AND OBJECTING ANNUAL DRIVER. COULD ABANDON A WOMAN BLEEDING TO DEATH FROM AN ECTOPIC. AND THAT WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE ROLE. THE REAL PERPETUATES WIDESPREAD DISCRIMINATION AGAINST POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY FACE OBSTACLES TO OBTAINING CARE. INTERFERING WITH CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES MISSIONS TO OFFER QUALITY CARE TO PATIENTS TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS FOR BLOOM OF OUR POPULATIONS. THE RULE ALSO TARGET TO SAY THE CALIFORNIA IT'S POLICY GOALS AND PRIORITIES THREATENING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AS A RESULT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER THIS ROLE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE AND SUCCESSFULLY ARGUED IT WAS UNLAWFULLY CREATED STOPPING THE ROLE FROM GOING INTO A FACT. THE COURT AGREED THE ROLE WAS IN CONFLICT WITH UNDERLYING STATUTES QUOTE THE BALLOT STRUCK BY CAR CONGRESS AND HARMONIZING PROTECTION OF CONSCIOUS OBJECTIONS VIS A VIS THE UNDER UP ON INTERRUPTED FLOW OF THE HEALTH. TO AMERICANS BUT WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THAT THIS RULE IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO USE FEDERAL RULES TO DESTROY ACCESS TO CARE FOR WOMEN IN LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS. USING HEALTH CARE AS A WEAPON. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN OTHER CASES LIKE THE BIRTH CONTROL CASE WITH ADMINISTRATION CREATED NOT ONE BUT TWO RULES FOR A MORAL AND A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO DENY BIRTH CONTROL TO WOMEN- TITLE TEN WHICH MY COLLEAGUE TALK OUR NATION FAMILY. PROGRAM MEDICAL PRIVACY BE GAGGED AND COUNTLESS OTHERS ENSURING ACCESS REAP HEALTH CARE INCLUDING SAFE LEGAL ABORTION IS A PRIORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST IN ENSURING ALL ALL HEALTH CARE IS IT. THOSE FIRST. TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN SO AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING HEALTH CARE IN LGBT CARE UNDER THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LSO CREATED OTHER WAYS TO PROTECT ACCESS TO CARE ONE SUCH TOOLS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY UNDER THE CORPORATIONS CODE. FIFTY NINE FOURTEEN THREE FIFTY NINE TWENTY SIX ENSURE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF SERVICES FOR ALL NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE TRANSACTIONS. INCLUDING NONPROFIT HEALTH HOSPITALS.

MERGER IMPACTS THOSE THOSE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY THE PUBLIC INCLUDING THAT AFFECTED COMMUNITY IS ENCOURAGED.

THE TRADER TAKES YOU COMMENTS EXPERT NOW CAN THE MEXICAN SO EITHER NINE THE- BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN THE BEST A OF THE CAN. OR THE CONDITION OR WITHIN REQUIRE. THE PART OF WITH THE SALE MERGER LIKE CHARITY CARE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THERE'S NOT. SERVICE THINGS LIKE ME TO THE THREE HEALTH CARE. FOR MEN YEARS THESE CONDITIONS PRIOR ACTS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH LONG BEFORE WE MY BOSS. WAS AN OFF. THAT WE MADE VERY CLEAR THAT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AS A PRIORITY. IN ADDITION WHEN THIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TOOK OFFICE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HE CREATED A NEW OFFICE CALLED THE HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AN ACCESS SECTION WHICH WILL ALSO LOOK TO ENSURE- IN THESE NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE TRANSACTIONS THAT THERE IS ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND THAT WE'RE NOT PROVIDING ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF CARE. I'M A FEW KEY KEY EXAMPLES OF THESE MERGERS AFFILIATIONS ACQUISITIONS- IS ONE THE DIGNITY CATHOLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES MERGER THIS WAS IMPORTANT TO- THE COMMUNITY AND ONE THAT MANY ADVOCATES MANY OF THOSE HERE IN THE ROOM TODAY WEIGHED IN HEAVILY ON- PATIENT GROUPS OTHERS WAIT AND WAS ABOUT WE MAINTAIN WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'M CHANGE FOR FIVE YEARS- IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A SECULAR. TRANSACTION I'M ANY SIXTY TEN WE A CLEAR. THAT THE DIGNITY IN AND CATHOLIC AND MUST KNOW THE GENERAL'S OFFICE AT FORTY DAYS IN ADVANCE. BEFORE YOU READ OR INTO IN A HEALTH SERVICES. AND THEN. IN EXPERT TO IT WHETHER REDUCTION DISCONTINUATION AND IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CAN. THERE WAS ALSO THE DELAY NO MAY CENTER TRANSACTION WITHOUT. WE'RE WE ASK VERY VERY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW AT WOMEN'S HEALTH LGBT K. WOULD WHAT HAVE WHEN YOU HAVE AN- PREGNANCY WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A WOMAN IS SEEKING CERTAIN TYPES OF CONTRACEPTIVES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PATIENT NEEDS. PARTICULAR COUNSELLING REFERRALS- AND YOU'LL SEE AN EXHIBIT TO OF THAT TRANSACTION WE HAD VERY SPECIFIC ANSWERS AND RESPONSES BECAUSE HE WANTED THERE TO BE VERY CLEAR LINES IN TERMS OF WHAT SERVICES WERE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. LAST THERE WAS THE SEAT CHAU SAID THE PROPOSING STEPS- HEALTH SYSTEM AB INTO LAST. SYSTEM WHICH WAS DENIED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM COMMUNITY. ON THIS WORK ANY BE A PRETTY FOR THE GENERAL. AND WE'LL BE WORK CLOSELY. THE ROOM ACROSS THE DIET. WHEN WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE IT. THANK YOU. THANK SO MUCH FOR PAINTING LANDSCAPING FOR WORK WITH THE GENERAL. MISS CROWE YOU HAVE OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU. I MORNING MY NAME MAGGIE AND PRIOR TO BECOMING FOR PARENTHOOD SHE LEGAL. CA YEARS I WAS A- AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN FIFTEEN YEARS RIGHT HANDLED SEXUAL ABUSE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES- THE IT MY MESSAGE TODAY IS ABOUT- OUR PATIENTS AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE THE BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE. AND HOW THE RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES HAVE HAVE IMPACTED THOSE CHALLENGES AND CREATED ADDITIONAL BARRIERS- VISIT THE POINT HERE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AS TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH CARE. IF OF CALIFORNIA. SEVEN IF IN CAL THEY ALL OFFER REGIONALLY AND TOGETHER WE OPERATE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT HEALTH CENTERS AROUND THE STATE. AND SEE CLOSE TO A MILLION PATIENTS EACH YEAR PROVIDING PATIENTS WITH FULL SCOPE OF SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE. INCLUDING ABORTION. AS HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EDUCATORS AND ADVOCATES PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS COMMITTED TO SERVING ALL PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WITH CARE AND RESPECT. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE DESERVE HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE AND COMPASSIONATE NON JUDGMENTAL EDUCATION. AS WELL AS THE ABILITY AND THE RE THIS IS TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DIGNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE NO MATTER WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY LIVE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO LIVE HEALTHY LIVES. PLAN THEIR FAMILIES MEET THEIR LIFE GOALS WITHOUT CHAMBER JUDGMENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE REALITY IS THAT NOT ALL PEOPLE DO. ALONG WITH FACING BARRIERS SUCH AS COSTS TO TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE CO PAYS DEDUCTIBLES JUST TO NAME A FEW. PATIENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALSO FACED WITH UNJUST LAWS STICK MY DEEP ROOTED HEALTH AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES. AND FORCE RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS CRITICAL CARE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN WORKING TO PUT UP MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO CARE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND MANY OF WHICH ARE GROUNDED IN RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THREE EXAMPLES- THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS ALREADY TOUCHED ON A BIT SO FIRST OF ALL THE BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE ROLL BACK- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIRES THAT EMPLOYERS PROVIDE COVERAGE TO EMPLOYEES FOR BIRTH CONTROL WITHOUT IMPOSING CARSHARING BUT THE ROLL. WOULD HAVE EXEMPTED EMPLOYERS WITH RELIGIOUS OR MORAL OBJECTIONS FROM THIS REQUIREMENT. SO IF EMPLOYERS REFUSED TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO EMPLOYEES FOR CONTRACEPTION BECAUSE O THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR CONTRACEPTION SUFFER GAPS IN CARE AS THEY TRY TO HUNT DOWN- ALTERNATIVE COVERAGE OR FOR GO CONTRACEPTION LEADING TO AN INCREASE. IN UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE CARE THAT IS NOT INTERRUPTED OR DENY DUE TO AN EMPLOYER'S RELIGIOUS. BELIEFS LEADS TO MORE POSITIVE OUTCOMES WE'VE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN- WITH OUR PATIENTS DECREASES IN UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES OR LONG TERM GOALS AND CORRESPONDING. DECREASES IN THE REST GOVERNMENT MORTALITY OR ADVERSE CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES. SO THIS RULE IS CURRENTLY JOINED BY. A LIMITED SCOPE IN JUNCTION IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS A NATIONWIDE INJUNCTION PENNSYLVANIA BUT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WE'LL BE HEARING ARGUMENT ON IT- IN APRIL I THINK APRIL TWENTY NINTH- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE TITLE TEN GAG RULE- WHICH WHICH WE'VE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN HERE ALREADY BUT THIS IS WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USED IDEOLOGY TO LIMIT. ACCESS TO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE OVER THE ISSUE OF ABORTION ACCESS. LAST YEAR THE UNETHICAL RESTRICTIONS OF THE TITLE TEN GAGGLE FORCED PLANNED PARENTHOOD NATIONALLY AND OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA OUT OF THE TITLE TEN PROGRAM. AND THAT WAS THE NATION'S ONLY DEDICATED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND REBEL BIRTH CONTROL PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS. WE WERE FORCED OUT BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO WITHHOLD CRUCIAL INFORMATION FROM PATIENTS OF THEIR PREGNANCY OPTION. BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR THERE HEALTH. AND THEIR- IT'S. A PLAN. ENTER THE HEALTH. HAD ROUTE BE PART OF THE TITLE AND PRO. WHICH A MILLION PAGE HEARING AND TO THIRDS THOSE. ACTUALLY RECEIVE. CARE AT ONE. IT HAS A HUNDRED AND EIGHT HELL CENTERS. PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BIRTH CONTROL EXPAND STI TESTING AND TREATMENT AND ADVANCE ACCESS IN OTHER AREAS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. DESPITE BEING FORCED OUT OF THE PROGRAM WHILE THE COURT PROCEEDINGS RAN THEIR COURSE PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES- HAVE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND NON JUDGMENT JUDGMENTAL BUT- SEX CASE. WHICH ONLY NINE CIRCUIT RECENTLY DIDN'T CHANGE AND OF OUR ABILITY TO IN THE- CALIFORNIA PARENTHOOD IS CAN TO BE FORCED OUT WERE SUPPLEMENTING THE LACK OF TITLE TEN FUNDS. WITH OTHER FUNDING STREAMS- BUT THE POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE HERE AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND IS THIS VERY DANGEROUS PHENOMENON OF THE EMERGENCE OF FAKE CLINICS WITHOUT NEXT WITHOUT MEDICAL EXPERTISE IN THOSE CLINICS. ARE GAINING GROUND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO KNOWS ALL TOO WELL AND THE EXAMPLE IN THE TITLE TEN SPACE. IS BREA- BREA. IT WAS ORIGINALLY CHRISTIAN MINISTRY AND FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER OVER YOUR RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE FROM THE GOVERNMENT FROM TITLE TEN. AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW REALLY LIEU LEGITIMIZING RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE SO THEY ARE A CHRISTIAN BASED CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTER THAT VETS ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ENSURE THAT. IT IS HIRING- SUFFICIENTLY CHRISTIAN AND HE'S- AND THERE'S EVEN A QUESTION ON THEIR INTAKE FORMS- ASKING PATIENTS ABOUT THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. ALTHOUGH A RE IT CLAIMS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE OF IS NOT FROM ABORTION OR MAKE ABORTION REFERRALS. AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY HORMONAL BIRTH CONTROL INSTEAD PROMOTING NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING. SEEKING CONTROL OR OF. MIGHT MIGHT GO TO A REAL BELIEVING THAT IT OFFERS THE SERVICES THAT THEY SEEK. IF YOU IF YOU LOOK ON THE INTERNET YOU CAN EASILY- BE DIRECTED TO A RIO WHEN GOOGLING SOMETHING LIKE BIRTH CONTROL OR ABORTION- BUT INSTEAD YOU'RE GOING TO BE TREATED BY PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO REFUSED TO PROVIDE THOSE SIR. AS BECAUSE THEIR OWN WILL FULLY. AND PATIENTS MAY ALSO BE CURT TO GET TREATMENT THAT IS INEFFECTIVE OR EVEN DANGEROUS THEIR HEALTH. FOR EXAMPLE- OVER YET TOUTED ITS USE OF THE ABORTION REVERSAL PILL AND ON. SAID THAT IS. THAT YOU HAD HALL A STUDY IT. DOES CURVES AS AN OBSTACLE BUT A BARRIER BECAUSE PAGE ARE TO IN THIS. FROM THE CARE THEY NEED. AND IF THEY LEAVE OR HERE TO SEE ANOTHER PRO LIKE PLAN PARENTHOOD THEIR DELAY. IN RECEIVING THE CARE THEY NEED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REAL HAS CHEN MY IS A RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY THAT OVER YET ESPOUSES BY GRANTING THEM TITLE TEN FUNDING. ORANGE COUNTY HAS ALSO GIVEN LEGITIMACY TO OVER YEAH BY AWARDING A REAL MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION MONEY THAT A PRE. EVENT AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE FINAL EXAMPLE- THAT I WANTED THAT I WANT TO GIVE HERE THAT. MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- I'M IS A FEDERAL PERMIT YOU RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY TO CONSTRUCT. ACT I'M AS- THAT REFUSAL AT WOULD ALLOW FOR THOSE IN THE MEDICAL FIELD TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS THE REFUSAL ROLE IS DANGEROUS TO PATIENTS A PERSON'S HEALTH CARE SHOULD NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE PERSON HEALTHCARE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY MEDICAL NEED NOT BY THE RELIGIOUS VIEW POINTS OF A PHARMACIST- HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR A DOCTOR THE RULE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED DOCTORS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS TO REFUSE TO TREAT OR HELP PATIENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS WHICH DISCRIMINATES AGAINST PATIENTS AND NICE PEOPLE HEALTHCARE. LGBT Q. PEOPLE WHO ALREADY FACE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE COULD BE DENIED POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING HEALTHCARE THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BARRIERS TO ACT. FINLEY ABORTION. RULE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW REALLY ENTER ABOVE THE HOW AND OF PATIENTS IN DEFIANCE OF FUNDAMENTAL MEDICAL ETHICS JEOPARDIZES PATIENTS ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE CARE SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ATTACKS UPON HEALTHCARE HAVE TIME AND TIME AGAIN BEEN DRIVEN BY RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGY THAT PURPOSELY CONSTRUCTS BARRIERS TO CARE BUT NO THIS PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA AND MANY OTHER POSITIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE COMMITTED TO EXPANDING NOT BANNING ACCESS TO CRITICAL SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE BY BREAKING ON THESE VERY TO CARE. WE SPONSORED A BILL BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LONGER TO ENSURE THAT PROVIDERS ARE TRAINED ON IMPLICIT BIAS WE ARE COMMITTED TO BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO CARE FOR THE MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA PLANNED PARENTHOOD PAGE ARE IN FACT 90% AT OR BELOW 2100% OF THE FEDERAL ALREADY LINED WE SERVE A SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF STATUS MIGRANT WORKERS THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. PATIENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH SKILLS LBT LGBT Q. PEOPLE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ALSO PROVIDE SEXUAL HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER BREAK DOWN BARRIERS TO CARE OUR SERVICES INCLUDE EDUCATION IN A SLING ON SEXUAL AND REPRINT HEALTH GENDERS BIRTH CONTROL INCLUDE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION TESTING AND MEN OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND H. I. V. THE FILM ALSO PROVIDE. STING PURPOSES SINCE ANSWERED IS AS. SERVICES OFFERED TO REACH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND EVEN THOSE FROM OTHER STATES AND TO MEET PATIENTS WHERE THEY ARE. BUT ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON YOUR ZIP CODE OUR RIGHTS ARE FREEDOMS AND OUR HEALTH CARE SHOULD DEPEND ON WHERE WE LIVE. HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE OR WHAT RELIGION ARE DOCTOR IS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CRAWFORD THAT INSIGHT. I'M AND NOW WE WILL ASK MISS GOOD ONE IF SHE HAS ANY OPENING REMARKS S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IT IS A PLEASURE AND HONOR TO BE WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MICHELLE. ROGER GOOD WHEN I AM A CHANCELLOR'S PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE WHERE I DIRECT THE CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY. AND GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY. THE PRE TO WRITE MY REMARKS IS THAT PRESERVING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROTECTING IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. THE US LEADS THE DEVELOPED WORLD IN THE RATE OF MATERNAL MORTALITY. IF YOU GO TO THE C. I. A.'S WEBSITE THAT'S THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WEBSITE YOU'D SEE THAT IT'S SAFER FOR A WOMAN A- BIRTH IN BOSNIA OR SO YOUR RATE YEAH. THE YOU STATES BECAUSE THE RISK THAT EVEN IN STATES THAT IS IN THOSE. WE LACK FAR ABOUT. TREES HE WOULD CONSIDER NOT BE OUR PEER GROUP THE THEY COUNTRY. ARE THAT WAY. OTHER TIME HAVE CALLED. BIRD WERE THERE CALLED PART OF OUR DEVELOPING SOUTH. BUT MEN DOT IN OUR COUNTRY I AT LEARNING RATES WOMEN. BLACK MEN IN PARTICULAR THEIR RATE MATERNAL. IS ABOUT TIME THAT OF WHITE WOMEN EVEN MORE DRAMATIC INSTEAD LIKE LOUISE. AND MISSISSIPPI AND OUR- BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE RATES OF DEATH THAT AND- IN THAT NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. THE UNITED STATES LEADS IT'S A GLOBAL PEERS AND THE RATES OF STDS AND SYPHILIS IN AND WANTED UP. SEE IN FACT IS THIS A CD. THAT THE GO I. OR IT. NOT I WE HAD A SOMETHING WE HAD OUT TO THE FULLEST IN OUR COUNTRY INCLUDING CONGENITAL SYPHILIS WILL NOW IT'S BACK AND EVEN AT GREATER RATES IN CALIFORNIA THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE LIKED. AND IRONICALLY. WITH THE ATTACKS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INCLUDING I EDUCATION AT SCHOOLS WHICH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. AND INCLUDING A DIRECT SERVICES TITLE TEN AND MORE. A WOMAN IS FOURTEEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY CARRYING A PREGNANCY TO TERM IN THE UNITED STATES THAN SHE IS BY TERMINATING THAT PREGNANCY. LET ME CONCLUDE MY PREAMBLE BEFORE I GET INTO MY MAIN- REMARKS BY JUST STATING THE FOLLOWING IT WAS GEORGE H. W. BUSH WHO SHEPHERDED TITLE TEN. THROUGH CONGRESS AND IT WAS RICHARD NIXON WHO SIGNED THAT LEGISLATION INTO LAW. AND ONE INTERVIEWED BOTH SET THIS WAS BSIC PUBLIC HEALTH AND BASIC COMMON SENSE IT'S A SHAME BUT NOW THERE'S BEEN SUCH A DRAMATIC ATTACK AND- IN A PILLAGING OF THE RESOURCES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN. IN THAT PROGRAM. I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AND I AM A BIOETHICIST- I'M- MORE OVER THE CORE AREA OF MY SCHOLARSHIP AND TEACHING OUR HEALTH LAW CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ON TORT LAW. IN ADDITION TO MY APPOINTMENT AS A CHANCE WHICH PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE I DIRECT THE CENTER FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY IN GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. BY FURTHER WAY OF BACKGROUND I'M AN ELECTED MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE. AND THE HASTINGS CENTER WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING THE FIELD F BIOETHICS. FINALLY I BEGAN MY LAW TEACHING CAREER AT A CATHOLIC AFFILIATED LAW SCHOOL WHERE I ALSO DIRECTED IT'S HEALTH WHAT PROGRAM AND I GRADUATED FROM A CATHOLIC LAW SCHOOL I AM DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH THE CHURCH IT'S ACTUALLY VALID. AND SKETCHING SO. FROM THE OUTSIDE I WISH TO MAKE. CLEAR THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND- AFFILIATIONS WHICH IMPEDE RESTRICT OR HINDER THE CARE OF YOU SEE STUDENTS FACULTY OR STAFF. THAT THEY RECEIVED BASED ON RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE VIOLATE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AS WELL AS SPECIFIC CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION THAT FOR BID. THE IMPOSITION OF RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE ON YOU SEE STUDENT FACULTY OR STAFF STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ALSO PROHIBITS UC AND MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS FOR STRIPPING. IMPEDING OR BUYING HERE ON THE BAY FOR LIVE DOCTRINE. THE ACTIONS THAT THEY CAN SEND THE PEACE STAMP DATE QUOTE. NUMBERS AND HEART IN THE PAST. HERE'S THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE NINE SECTION NINE SUB PART II. HOWEVER ONE NEED NOT SCOUR THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION TO LOCATE THIS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IT IS PROMINENTLY FEATURED ON THE WEBSITE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REGENTS. OF THE MANY DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO YOU AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE ACCESS TO AFTER THE WORKING GROUP WHICH WAS APPOINTED RIGHT UP PRESIDENT OF POLITICS ON A- ESTABLISHMENT DOCUMENTS THAT HAVE THAT ARE PART OF THAT PACKAGE. YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS PRINCIPLED STANDS OUT BUT I URGE A DEEPER READING OF THE ENTIRE ARTICLE NINE IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION FROM WHICH THIS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE EMERGES. AS IT GRUNDS NOT ONLY THAT PRINCIPLE BUT ALSO PLACES AND LARGER CONTEXT. THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PROMOTION OF LECTURE. CONTENT AND MORE IMPROVEMENT. THIS BY A CLOSE READING OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTION ARTICLE NINE SECTION THIRTEEN SUBPART F. SORRY TO GET INTO SUCH IMPORTANT DETAIL BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I GIVEN WHAT IS AT STAKE. BECAUSE IT ALSO SPECIFY QUOTE THE UNIVERSITY SHALL BE ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF ALL POLITICAL AND SECTARIAN INFLUENCE AND KEPT FREE THERE FROM IN THE APPOINTMENT OF ITS REGIONS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. IT'S A FIGURES. THE CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMERS WERE CLEAR ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE FROM ITS EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS THROUGHOUT ARTICLE NINE IT SPEAKS TO THIS NOR SHALL ANY SECTARIAN OR DENOMINATIONAL DOCTRINE BE TAUGHT. OR INSTRUCTION THERE ON PERMITTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN ANY OF THE COMMON SCHOOLS OF THIS STATE THIS CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE NINE SECTION EIGHT. THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMERS SOUGHT TO PROTECT RELIGIOUS MINORITIES FROM DISCRIMINATION BUT VERY CLEAR THAT NEITHER COMMON SCHOOLS NOR UNIVERSITIES WOULD BE IN WHAT. OR DICTATED TO BITE RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE SO WHAT IS AT STAKE. HERE ARE AT STAKE END OF CONCERN THE PRESENT MATTER OUR CONTRACTS SIGNED BY THE UC EXECUTIVES THAT VIOLATE THE IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES THAT I JUST STATED ABOVE. THE CONTRACTS OF CONCERN- WHICH I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW OUR PRIMARILY INTRODUCED TO WITH CATHOLIC AFFILIATED MEDICAL PROVIDERS HERE I'LL SINGLE OUT CATHOLIC AFFILIATIONS BECAUSE THEY EXPLICITLY DEMAND CONDITIONS OF THE YOU SEE THAT VIOLATE. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND THUS IMPERMISSIBLE EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MANY ORGANIZATIONS WITH WHICH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AFFILIATES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. A CALF HOSPITALS DO SERVE THE POOR AND THAT IS WONDERFUL THAT THEY DO THAT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INVESTED- IN DOING THAT BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US TODAY. AND WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT THESE CONTRACTS ARE BEING NEGOTIATED AT THE PRESENT RENEGOTIATED AT THE PRESENT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE INTERRED INTO OBLIGATING AND BINDING YOU SEE STUDENTS FACULTY AND EMPLOYEES TO FOLLOW RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE IS DEEPLY DISCONCERTING. AND A VIOLATION OF LAW. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AT STAKE AND WHY THE PERCEPTION THAT THE AFFILIATIONS WILL NOT. COMPROMISE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES IS ON FOUND IT I POINT YOU TO THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE DOCUMENT THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE WHICH X. ENDS UPON PAGE BY PAGE IS IT'S- WRITTEN BY THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC. AT THIS IS THE SIXTH XIN. OUTLINES WHAT- THE RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES ARE WHAT THE CHURCH WILL LET WILL NOT ATTACK. THANK YOU WAS DEVELOPED BY. NINE ON. OF YOUR STATES CA OF BISHOPS THE U. S. C. C. B. AND APPROVED BY THE U. S. C. C. B. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT ITS PLENARY ASSEMBLY. THIS DOCUMENT SERVES AS THE CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE IN IT SERVES AS THE THEOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THE CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE MINISTRY. THEIR WORD TO DEFINE HER CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS WILL ENTER INTO CONTRACTS. THE A RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES OTHER RISE REFERRED TO AS E. R. D.'S GUIDE CATHOLIC MEDICAL CARE. SIMPLY PUT THE E. R. D.'S DICTATE ALL ARRANGEMENTS COLLABORATIONS IN CONTRACTS WITH AFFILIATES SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THE LANGUAGE IS UNEQUIVOCAL EXPLICIT AND REALLY HARD TO MISS THE BISHOPS RIGHT QUOTE THE CATHOLIC PARTY IN A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT HAS THE RESPONSES BE TO ASSESS PERIODICALLY WHETHER THE BINDING AGREEMENT IS BEING OBSERVED AND IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NATURAL MORAL LAW. CATHOLIC TEACHING AND CAMPAñA NOT CALIFORNIA LAW. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH MAY DICTATE ITS OWN TEACHINGS AND THEOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHIES BUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MUST NOT BE RULED NOR GOVERNED BY THEM. EQUALLY THE UC MUST NOT IN FORCE CATHOLIC TEACHING. HOWEVER THE E. R. D.'S LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR SPECULATION OR DOUBT THAT THAT IS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S VALUES PRINCIPLES AND DIRECTIVES THAT WILL GOVERN ALL CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO. FOR EXAMPLE V. E. R. D. FURTHER STATE QUOTE BEFORE AFFILIATING WITH A HEALTH CARE INTO T. THAT PERMITS IMMORAL PROCEDURES. LIKE INSTITUTION MUST ENSURE THAT IN THERE IT'S ADMINISTRATORS NOR ITS EMPLOYEES WILL MANAGE CARRY OUT ASSIST IN CARRYING OUT MAKE ITS THE LADY'S AVAILABLE FOR MAKE REFERRALS FOR OR BENEFIT FROM THE REVENUE GENERATED BY IMMORAL PROCEDURES. HERE DO YOU ARE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS VALUE WILL DICTATE ALL TERMS AND ALL MEDICAL AFFILIATIONS THAT IS QUOTE IN ANY TIME ELABORATION WHAT EVER COMES UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CATHOLIC IT TO XIN WHETHER ACQUISITION. I IT'S WARM IN A MEANT MUST BE OPERATE IN FOR ACCORD WITH THE MORAL TEACHINGS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH INCLUDING THESE DIRECTIVES. EVEN THOUGH SOME MEDICAL EXECUTIVES IN THE UC MIGHT BELIEVE THEIR INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS QUOTE OVER RIDE THE CONTRACTS THEY WOULD BE MISTAKEN. IN THE CONTRACT THAT I HAVE REVIEWED DURING MY TIME IN WORKING ON A WORKING GROUP APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT THE POLITBURO THE EXPENSE WILL EXPLICITLY DRAW UPON THAT THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN THE CONTRACT WITH UC IRVINE THE AFFILIATION AGREEMENT WITH ST JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE STATES C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. PATIENT CARE&lt;/c&gt;</u> PURSUANT TO SECTION SEVEN ZERO SEVEN ONE THREE OF TITLE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT HOSPITAL WITH ITS MEDICAL STAFF RETAINS PROFESSIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO HOSPITAL PATIENT. FURTHER SCHOOL SHALL CONDUCT ITS ACTIVITIES AND PROVIDING SERVICES HERE UP HERE UNDER CONSISTENT WITH HOSPITAL PHILOSOPHY HOSPITAL PHILOSOPHY PHILOSOPHY MEANING CATHOLIC CHURCH PHILOSOPHY. AND VALUES AND THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH SERVICES. SIMILARLY THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN CONTRACT BETWEEN DIGNITY HEALTH AND THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ON THE BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS DEMANDS QUOTE STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS SHALL COMPLY WITH THE STATEMENT OF COMMON VALUES AS ADOPTED BY DIGNITY. AND IF FACILITY IS CATHOLIC SPONSORED WITH THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR THE CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC. BISHOPS PROBLEMATICALLY UC STUDENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SIGN SUCH CONTRACTS OBLIGATING THEM THAT'S LEE QUOTE. IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT HOSPITAL AS A DIVISION OF DIGNITY HEALTH. OPERATES AS AN EXTENSION OF THE RELIGIOUS WORKS OF THE DIGNITY HEALTH RELIGIOUS SPONSORS. FOR IT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT THE POLICIES AND PRACTICES OF HOSPITAL SHALL CONFORM TO THE PRINCIPLES INHERENT IN THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE'S SAYS INCORPORATED. BOB REFERENCE SO NOT ONLY STUDENTS BEING OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW VIS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BUT ALSO MEDICAL PROVIDERS ALSO BEING FORCED TO FOLLOW THESE IN THE CONTRACTS THAT WERE SIGNED. FOR STUDENTS THE PRESSURE CO WORST OR FORCED TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS WHICH CONFLICT WITH THEIR VALUES THEY MIGHT FEEL INTIMIDATED OR PERCEIVED BINDING SUCH CONTRACTS AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EDUCATION THEY MIGHT BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PRACTICE E. R. D. DICTATED MEDICINE AS PART OF THEIR YOU SEE EDUCATION. WE OF CONCERN THEN ARE THE TERMS TO WHICH YOU FACULTY STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE HELD AS PATIENT OR PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE E. R. D. SEVENTY STATES QUOTE. CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN% IMMEDIATE MATERIAL COOPERATION IN ACTIONS ARE INTRINSICALLY IMMORAL SUCH AS ABORTIONS EUTHANASIA ASSISTED SUICIDE. AND DIRECT STERILIZATION. THIS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE IMPORTANT FORMS OF CONTRACEPTION. NOT ONLY DO SUCH YOUR ID'S CONFLICT WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND VALUES AT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. BECAUSE THEY ARE ROOTED IN RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE THEY ALSO CONFLICT WITH CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BECAUSE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS AN BACK. IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. CALIFORNIA THE STATE PROTECTS PRIVACY AND AUTONOMY IN REPRODUCTIVE DECISION MAKING AND END OF LIFE CARE MOREOVER IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GOLD STANDARD OF MEDICAL CARE AFTER SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE IS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION. HOWEVER EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION IS NOT PROVIDED A CATHOLIC HOSPITALS BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED QUOTE A SEN BY THE UNITED STATES CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS. TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF MEDICAL CARE INDEED EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION IS NOT COUNCIL OR SPOKEN ABOUT A CATHOLIC OSPITALS CALIFORNIA'S AMONG MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES TO REQUIRE EMERGENCY CARE FACILITIES TO MAKE AVAILABLE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION TO PATIENTS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE RATE. THIS STANDARD TO WHICH USE HE IS HELD IS COMPROMISED AND VIOLATED WHEN IT BENDS TO RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES NOW AS I BEGIN TO CLOSE I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THE FOLLOWING. IMAGINE TRAINING OUR STUDENTS THAT AFTER A GIRL OR WOMAN IS RAPED THAT DENYING INFORMATION IS THE PROPER FORM OF TREATMENT. ACCORDING TO YOU SEE ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT 53% OF YOU SEEK UNDERGRADUATE- ARE WOMEN AND 43% OF OUR GRADUATE ACADEMIC STUDENTS ARE WOMEN. THE RISKS AND THE CHALLENGES ARE REAL- WITH THIS. FINALLY I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY YOU SEE MEDICAL EXECUTIVES. SOME OF ARTICULATED THAT AFFILIATIONS WITH CATHOLIC MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THOSE INSTITUTIONS SERVE THE POOR INDEED IN SOMEINSTANCES CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND OTHERS HAVE STEPPED IN WHEN GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED IN OUR SOCIETY. THAT TYPE OF CHERRY COULD BE APPLAUDED. THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT DESERVES URGENT ATTENTION. YET CATHOLIC CHARITIES WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THAT IMPORTANT WORK EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF UC AFFILIATIONS BECAUSE THEIR DELIVERY OF CARE IS NOT CONTINGENT ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. EQUALLY PROPONENTS OF YOU SEE AFFILIATING WITH CATHOLIC HOSPITALS ARTICULATE THAT SOME OF THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE FOR ADOLESCENTS SUFFERERS OF COMPROMISE MENTAL HEALTH IS TAKING PLACE AT CATHOLIC HOSPITALS. INTERVENTIONS TO AID IN THE CARE OF THE YOUTH ARE GREATLY IMPORTANT PERSONALLY I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES HOWEVER THOSE INVALUABLE SERVICES TO THE YOUTH ARE ALSO NOT CONTINGENT ON YOU SEE AFFILIATION. MORE OVER A YOUTH SUFFERING FROM AN UNWANTED PREGNANCY AND EXPERIENCING THE TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH IT OR RAPE WOULD BE DENIED THE MEDICAL CARE AND COUNSELLING NEEDED IF IT INVOLVED EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION OR ABORTION AT A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL. I APPLAUD YOU FOR BRINGING US HERE TODAY AND PROVIDING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR CONCERN REGARD TO RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS AND THE WAYS IN WHICH RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE HAS COM TO CHALLENGE CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND ALSO AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO LEAD IN THIS REGARD TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND THE HEALTH NOT JUST OF WOMEN AND GIRLS BUT ALSO MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AND I WOULD FURTHER STATE THAT IN A BROADER SENSE- THE LIMITATIONS OF CARE BY CERTAIN RELIGIOUS AFFILIATIONS- EXPAND BEYOND THESE COMMUNITIES AS WELL ANYBODY WHO WILL EXPERIENCE AN END OF LIFE MUST ALSO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. IF THANK YOU MISTER WHEN- I TOO WENT TO ADDRESS WHAT LAW SCHOOL IN TIME TO DIGEST ALASKAN HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR WORK THAT IS DONE IN CATHOLIC INSTITUTIONS- BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS I APPRECIATE YOUR GIVING US THAT LEGAL LANDS WITH WHICH TO VIEW IT- I WON RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LONGER WAS JOINED US AND ASK HER IF SHE HAS ANY REMARKS ARE QUESTIONS THAT SHE WOULD LIKE FOR THE PANEL. I CAN JUST- WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIR WOMAN FOR- PUTTING. TOGETHER SUCH- A COMPREHENSIVE AND INFORMATIVE- COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY. AND BEFORE USING YOUR GRAVITAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE STELLAR- A TESTIMONIAL SO THANK YOU- FABULOUS OUTFIT TO I WAS- I'M INCREDIBLY STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT SO MANY COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE LIVING IN FEAR AND IN PERIL. I'M OF AN EXPANDING DOCTRINE THAT REALLY I BELIEVE IS DESIGNED TO MARGINALIZED- TO MAKE FOLKS LIVE IN FEAR I'M INTO A RACE OUR INSTABILITIES OUT OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND IF WE CAN CREATE GENERATIONS OF FOLKS WHO ARE AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT THEIR BODIES AND THEIR CHOICES- THEN WE HAVE DONE OUR SELF A GREAT DISSERVICE. I'M IN THE HISTORY FROM WHICH SO MANY OF US COME. I'M I WAS WONDERING HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU COULD SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SORT OF THIS SCOPING ASPECTS OF THESE ER DE USE- YOU KNOW HOW IT IMPACTS YOU KNOW AMBULANCE DRIVERS TECHNICIAN IS NURSES DOES IT- ARE THESE FOLKS ALSO SORT OF TIGHTER TETHERED TO THE YARD THESE AND IF THEY TOO ARE NOW BEING ALLOWED. TO SERVE DENY NORMAL SERVICES TO GET WOMEN OR POOR FOLKS ARE FOLKS IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY ACCESS TO THE SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE UNFORTUNATELY THEY WILL ALSO BE DENIED IF THEY GET INTO THOSE HOSPITALS AND YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT. I'M TRAINING AND I'M- RESIDENTS AND SO THAT ALSO LEADS ME TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE'RE TRAINING. OUR DOCTORS AND WAITING AND IF WE ARE SOMEHOW NOW BECAUSE OF THIS ALMOST A RADIC KADING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOU KNOW OBGYN FAMILY PLANNING CARE. AND WHAT THAT SAYS- TO HOW YOUNGER GENERATIONS WILL BE RECEIVING- YOU KNOW REAL LEGITIMATE OBJECTIVE NON RELIGIOUS INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR HELP. WITH OKAY SO ALL OPEN AND THEN- SHARE THE WITH MY FELLOW PANELISTS OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO YOUR CONCERNS. I DON'T HAVE EMPIRICAL DATA WITH REGARD TO AMBULANCE PROVIDERS- BUT THE QUESTION THAT YOU RAISE IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE E. R. D. IS- THEY GOVERN ALL CONTRACTS- THAT ARE MADE WITH CATHOLIC AFFILIATED I WILL. CATHOLIC AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS ARE GOVERNED BY THE ER DIS AND THOSE THAT COLLABORATE AN AFFILIATE WITH THEM ARE THEN GOVERNED BY WHAT THESE ER DIS STATE AND NOT WILL INCLUDE ALL STAFF ALL STUDENTS THE RESIDENTS THE DOCTORS THE NURSES THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN MEANS THAT THE TRAINING THAT INDIVIDUAL. RECIEVE MAY VERY WELL WENT BY THAT INSTEAD OF WHAT HAPPENS TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD IN TERMS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ONE EXAMPLE THAT I GAVE WAS. WITH REGARD TO A RATE IT IS THE GOLD STANDARD BUT AFTER A RAPE- THE INDIVIDUAL IS COUNSELED ABOUT EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION AND PROVIDED THAT OPTION NOT EVEN THE COUNSELING WILL TAKE PLACE I AT A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE COUNSELED IN THAT WAY IT'S CONSIDERED A SAN AND CERTAINLY NOT PROVIDED. EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS SUFFERING THROUGH AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY OR A MISCARRIAGE. IT CANNOT BE MANAGED AT A CATHOLIC OUR INSTITUTION OR CATHOLIC AFFILIATED INSTITUTION BECAUSE THAT TOO IS CONSIDERED A SEN. ONE CAN FIND A NUMBER OF CASES JUST BY A VERY EASY SEARCH OF WOMEN SENT HOME- IN NEAR DEATH SITUATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING COMPLICATED MISCARRIAGES I'M WHICH COULD LEAD TO INFECTION. I AND THE INFECTION LEADING TO DEATH AND THAT STILL SENT HOME AT CATHOLIC COST WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN INTO WILL SYMPATHETIC ENOUGH DISABLED I CAN. HOME PROVIDE TRIP FOR NOW IS INDIVIDUALS BEEN DOES AND FIVE IN VARIOUS. THESE CONCERNS ARE REAL AND ONE THAT YOU ALSO FLAG WHICH- IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING. THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE I AM EATING EXCITED BY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE WILL BE LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH YOUR BODY ABOUT STUDENTS RECEIVING FREE HENCE OF TRAINING WITH REGARD TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE UNITED STATES LEADS THE DEVELOPED WORLD IN TERMS OF MATERNAL MORTALITY- ABORTIONS ARE CRITICALLY SO THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SAFE THEY'RE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SAFEST PROCEDURES. AND OTHER PERSON A POSSIBLY. RIGHT THEY'RE SAFER THAN A COLONOSCOPY WHICH PEOPLE ARE ADVISED TO REGULARLY GET ANYA WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE GRADUATING FROM MEDICAL SCHOOLS WHO DO NOT KNOW HELLO TO PROTECT AND HELP A WOMAN WHO WANTS A PERSON WHO WANTS TERMINATE A PREGNANCY OR PERSON WHO IS TO MANAGE MISCARRIAGE. INDIVIDUALS THAT THE IN IN THE WHAT A TRAGIC SITUATION TO SHOW UP TO A HOSPITAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE ON. TODAY AS AS WE DO SIX TYPE OF A PER SURE I'M ALSO RENT TO THE TO FELLOW PANELISTS TO MY WANT TO ADD. TO THAT SURE I MEAN I'LL JUST ADD THAT IN ADDITION TO RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES WERE ALSO DEALING WITH HIS FELLOW FUSE ROLE. AND YOU KNOW IT. WAS IN THE ONE AND M. DRIVER A FARM DOCTOR IS ON. STRAIGHTER YOU KNOW ANYONE IN THE FIELD TO PUT THEIR OWN RELIGION PREFERENCE NOW EVEN THE MAN FIELD THE LIKE THE JANITOR AT THE FRONT DESK ASSISTANT IF THEY HAD AN OBJECTION TO THE CARE YOU'RE GETTING. AND IN THIS TIES INTO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT FEAR AND PROMOTION OF FEAR WHILE I THINK THAT HISTORY IS SO IMPORTANT YES I'M AN ACADEMIC AND- ACADEMIC MERIT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO BACK. RIGHT TO WHAT WAS ROE V. WADE WHAT THE HYSTERIA THAT'S BEEN CREATED AROUND PREGNANCY AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS AND JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES. ONE COULD THINK THAT IT WAS A SPLIT DECISION IT WASN'T. IT WAS A SEVEN TO TWO OPINION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. JUSTICE BLACKMUN WROTE THE OPINION FOR THE COURT JUSTICE BLACKMUN WAS A REPUBLICAN HE WAS APPOINTED BY RICHARD NIXON. AND IT'S IMPORTANT IN READING THE DETAILS OF THE CASE THE HISTORY THAT. JUSTICE BLACKMUN BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THE CASE. AS HE INFORMED THE COURT AND ALL THOSE WHO. READ THE CASE SENSE THAN ABORTION I HAD BEEN LEGAL IN U. STATES IT IS A LOT HISTORY THE PILL IS A PRESS. OF MAN. AND THREE. HEALTH CARE AND BEING. A PERSON IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE HYSTERIC MORE WITH YOU. ABOUT BECAUSE LET MOVE. HAVE ALL. STRONG ITERATION ABOUT ABORTION IN THE UNITED STATES ACTUALLY CAME AROUND THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR. AROUND THAT TIME NEARLY A CARE WAS BEING PERFORMED BY WOMEN WHO WERE MIDWIVES HALF OF WHOM WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR BLACK WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN FORMERLY ENSLAVED WHITE WOMEN IN NATIVE WOMEN AND IT WAS AT THE RISE OF GYNECOLOGY WAS KIND OF A PERFECT STORM. IT WAS THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SEEKING TO PUSH WOMEN OUT OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AND CARVE OUT A FIELD JUST FOR MEN SOUGHT TO CRIMINALIZE BOTH MIDWIFERY AND ALSO ABORTION AT THE SAME TIME. AND TO USE THAT PLATFORM THEN AS AN ANTI IMMIGRATION PLATFORM AS WELL. THANK YOU A HIGHLY HONORED AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE IN THING I HAVE TO GIVE US I'M- AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT IN THE WAKE THE ROE V. WADE CAME AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN WERE DYING. WHICH IS PART OF WHAT TOOK US TO WHERE WE WERE AT THAT POINT AND THAT THAT. THE RIGHT GUARANTEE UNDER ROE V. WADE THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY WHICH AS YOU SAID IS ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. IS STILL RIGHT VERY MUCH PROTECTED. IN THIS STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION. I'M SO MY- QUESTION ABOUT- SOME THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE PASSED. SO I AM JUST LAST YEAR SIGNED INTO LAW SENATOR LIVE HIS BILL WHICH REQUIRES UC CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION I AM CONFUSED FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE HOW. AN AFFILIATION OF THE CASTLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL UNDER WHICH UNDER CONTRACT LAW THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE CONTRACT WOULD INTERACT WITH OUR LEGISLATION WHICH MANDATES PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES. IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION WHAT IT REVEALS- HAPPENS TO BE THE TROUBLE THAT YOU SEE CAN'T OVER COM- OUT WITH THESE AFFILIATIONS- BECAUSE THE AFFILIATIONS MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT- THE WHAT GOVERNS THE RELATIONSHIP NOT JUST WITH THE UC BUT ANY OTHER INSTITUTION WILL IN FACT BE THESE RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES. AND SO IF THE YOU SEE SIGNS CONTRACTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES TO GOVERN- WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO THEN THAT WOULD SEEM TO MAINTAIN THAT THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT FOR OUR STUDENTS CANNOT BE PROVIDED FOR. IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS. IF YOU KNOW MY SENSE IS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE LOOKED AT AS A ZERO SUM GAME. IF IN FACT THE CHALLENGES THAT ODD THERE'S A NEED FOR MORE HOSPITAL BEDS IN CURRENTLY IN THE UNITED STATES ONE IN SIX HOSPITAL BEDS IS CATHOLIC IN SOME IN SOME CITIES IT'S EVEN A GREATER CONCENTRATION. IF OUR CHALLENGES THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO SERVE THE DEFAULT ANSWER ISN'T THEN WE MUST FOLLOW CATHOLIC YARD TEASING AND- THE REAL QUESTION. IS HOW DO YOU. GO ABOUT ACHIEVING THOSE AIMS AND HOW DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT WITH REAL EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION- AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING AND NOT JUST SIMPLY WELL WE MUST. AFFILIATE WE ACTUALLY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE NOT. SERVING OR COULD BE BETTER SERVED BUT ONCE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT DATA THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT ARE NECESSARY OR THAT SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SERVICE PEOPLE. WITH THE VALUES THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED THROUGH THE UC SYSTEM AND THROUGH THE STATE AND I AND I MUST SAY WHEN WE LOOK AT. OF MATERNAL MORTALITY AS I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FOUGHT HARD TO SAVE AND PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVES. YOU KNOW WHILE TEXAS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE DEADLIEST YOU KNOW THE DEADLIEST PLACE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD FOR PERSON TO BE PREGNANT. CALIFORNIA IN RECENT STUDIES IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE SAFEST PLACES AND IT'S BECAUSE THE WORK THAT YOU DO IT'S BECAUSE OF THE VALUES THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE CAN MEET THOSE KINDS OF GOALS. AND I READ THE- THE REPORT PUT OUT BY PRESIDENT OF POLISH ON IS WORKING GROUP WHICH I KNOW YOU SAT ON AND YOU MENTIONED. YOU KNOW GETTING THE EMPIRICAL DATA FIGURING OUT HOW TO MEET THOSE SAME NEEDS ANY AND AGAIN TO YOUR POINT AT THE BEGINNING- CATHOLIC HOSPITALS- SERVING IMPORTANT EVEN PART OF OUR STATE IN PROVIDING CARE THAT IS CRITICAL AND WE DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THAT- AND I UNDERSTAND THE GOALS THAT THOSE THAT LEAVES FILIATION WILL HELP HAS. HAS THERE BEEN CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS THROUGH DIFFERENT MEANS BESIDES AFFILIATION. NOW OKAY. THE SHORT ANSWER DOWN YES I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING TO AN AND I KNOW THAT- I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MY REMARKS BUT- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WELL HE REVIEWS OR WHOEVER. YOU'RE HER. REVIEWS AT ALL NONPROFIT HEALTH CARE TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU ALL HAVE GIVEN. THE OFFICE THAT. YOU IN A SORORITY AND IT'S VERY BROAD. WE DO NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE UC SYSTEM. SO WE GET THAT THAT QUESTION A LOT WOULD WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE UC'S THERE INDEPENDENT OF US. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE CAN'T GIVE YOU THAT AUTHORITY. THAT WOULD BE. I MEAN THAT BEER READING OF THE CONSTITUTION I MEAN THE CONSTITUTION SAYS AS YOU READ IT. THAT WE CAN'T INTERFERE. RIGHT AND IT. THAT HAMSTRINGS LEGISLATURE'S WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING I THINK IT'S IT COULD BE AN OPEN QUESTION OR ELSE OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT AT LET'S DISCUSS SO- AND THEN SO I JUST WANT TO LEAVE THE LAST QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IS WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT- WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH. THE RELIGIOUS REFUSAL LACKS TITLE TEN GAG RULE THE ACA ROLL BACK AND THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO RE TO LEAD US TO THE PLACE WHERE THESE DENIALS OF CARE- ARE IMPACTING COMMUNITIES IN VERY REAL WAYS- AND SO I JUST WANT TO ASK EACH OF YOU TO LEAVE US WITH WHAT IF YOU HAD A WISH FOR THE PROCEDURE AND- WE SHOULD WORK ON TO MOVE FORWARD FOR THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA WHAT THAT WOULD BE. I THINK I'M IN A DIFFERENT POSITION THE REST THE PANELISTS BECAUSE A WEEK WE REPRESENT EVERYONE WHEN THOSE LAWS GET. ULTIMATELY SUED BY FOLKS WHICH IS. ISN'T TO SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTHY GOALS AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED OF ALL THE WORK I MEAN I LOVE LIVING HERE AND I THINK IT'S PHENOMENAL THAT. YOU HAVE THIS PANEL YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE PROACTIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE LAWS- SO I THINK ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO ENSURE ACCESS TO SHORE UP- YOU KNOW ALL THAT THE PLACES THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TALKED ABOUT- BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING SO IN A WAY THAT WE'RE BALANCING- AND NOT SO IN A WAY THAT WERE CREATING A DICHOTOMY THAT YOU KNOW. MADE MAYBE MEANS IT'S NOT GONNA TRAVELING. ALLEN'S WOULD BE ARE SORT OF CAUGHT AS- I HEAR THAT. I'M JUST BEING HONEST. REALITY LIVE IN. YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO WE'RE HAPPY TO HAPPY TO SERVE. WELL I GUESS I REPRESENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN NOW AND REPRESENTING PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA- AND I'LL SAY THAT ON BOTH OF YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN TREMENDOUS CHAMPIONS FOR US- IN IN MANY OF THE LAWS THAT. YOU FAST AND IN YOUR IN YOUR WORK BEFORE COMING HERE- AND MY COLLEAGUE I THINK LEAD SIMPLY SO MUCH OF OUR AS YOUR- SHE'S THE VP OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD SO YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THE BILLS THAT SHE'S WORKING ON. ACROSS YOUR DESK BUT- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE THAT IS WHAT'S AT OUR CORE- WE WANT TO EXPAND SERVICES WE WANT TO REACH MORE PATIENTS WE WANT THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO REACH. PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH A SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS AND YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THOSE BARRIERS ONLY INCREASE UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH THE PUBLIC CHARGE ROLE WITH THE TITLE TEN GAG RULE WITH- YOU KNOW THE RELIGIOUS RULES ALL OF THAT- AND SO WHAT WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR OUR- YOU KNOW THROUGH FUNDING STREAMS THROUGH. YOU KNOW CREASES IN PROVIDERS GIVING PROVIDERS MORE TOOLS GIVING US OUR PROVIDERS ALL OF THOSE THINGS ENABLE ESSENTIALLY TO REACH MORE PATIENCE WITH- QUALITY HEALTHCARE. YEAH I WOULD ECHO EXACTLY WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE SAID AND I WOULD FURTHER ROOTED IN HISTORY AND THAT IS TO SAY THE REASON WHY WE NEED ALL OF THAT HAS JUST BEEN ARTICULATED BY MAGGIE IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL LIVING THROUGH THE LEGACIES OF UP OF WOMEN BEING SUBORDINATED IN OUR COUNTRY. LIVING THROUGH LEGACIES OF UNEQUAL TREATMENT ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY BY WOMEN IN OUR CAUGHT. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO RECTIFY THESE HISTORIES AND RECTIFY THEM THROUGH OUR COURTS AND WE KNOW THAT- THE IMPORTANCE OF. JURISPRUDENCE DOESN'T CHANGE SITUATIONS OVERNIGHT AND I THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WANT TO PROTECT SERVICES AND ACCESS ACCESS BECOMES CRITICALLY. IMPORTANT AND ACROSS EVERY REGARD WHETHER IT IS EDUCATION- TESTING FOR S. T. EYES BOB PRENATAL CARE ABORTION CARE- POSTNATAL CARE AND I WILL CLOSE ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT FANNIE LOU HAMER. BECAUSE IT I REFLECT BACK ON OUR CONSTITUTIONAL JURISPRUDENCE. THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT POOR WOMEN SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ABORTION KEEPER THROUGH MEDICAID. NAMING OF THE SUPREME COURT THE CITY WHERE THE COURT SAYS WELL YOU'RE WRONG THE STATE IS A NOTHING TO PLACE THESE WOMEN. IN THEIR CONDITIONS OF POVERTY AND THEN I THINK A FANNIE LOU HAMMER. WHO ON THE WAY TO VOTE IN MISSISSIPPI A STATE THAT FORCED PEOPLE TO GUESS HOW MANY BUBBLES ON A BAR OF SOAP. ARE HOW A ONLY BE. AYE IN A BAR OF JUST MEANS ARE RECITE STATE'S CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO VOTE. AND I'M REMINDED OF WHAT HE WAS SNATCHED OFF OF A US HER TO VOTE ALONG WITH THEIR WEAPON. WAS BEAT. UP IN A JAIL. I BEAT ON HER LEG THE SHE'S. POLIO AND THE SHEET. THE STORE ABOUT THE BOTH THE CITY AND ALSO SO BEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION SHE CAN. WITH SAYING ALL COUNT THAT WE WANT TO VOTE. I THINK THIS KIND AND IN THE SAME OF ENERGY BEHIND THAT LEGACY STILL HAUNTS US TODAY I THINK WE'RE STILL FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY IN IN THIS CASE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE TREATED WELL AND WITH DIGNITY WITH REGARD TO OUR BODIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO NOT THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EQUALIZERS WOMEN IN THE WORLD IS CONTROL OF OUR OWN FUTURES AND OUR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SAID THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE FOR YOUR CREDIBLE TESTIMONY. AND TO THIS DAY ONLY BEGIN THE CONVERSATION I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TO START IT. NOW I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP WELCOME UP OUR SECOND PANEL- I. THINK I SEE IS SHANNON OVERSEAS HERE WE READING. PATIENT TESTIMONIES SHE IS. CHEN IS NOT COMING SOMEONE ELSE COMING OKAY WE'LL SEE COMES UP. THE. OKAY. WE HAVE LAURA FRIEDMAN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR- AT THE BIG THE CENTER FOR GLOBAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH UCSF. AND PHILLIP BURLINGAME TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND GENDER EQUITY DIRECTOR AT THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. POLICE THAT YOU CAN MOTOR THE MARTIN LUTHER KING PROFESSOR OF LAW FROM UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW. AND I AM I BELIEVE THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED WILL BE JOINING US SHORTLY TO PROVIDE HIS OWN PERSONAL TESTIMONY- I MEAN HE WOULD KEEP HIS WALK UP WHEN HE GETS HERE. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US- I THINK WE WILL START WITH. THE PATIENT TESTIMONY FROM MICHELLE AND JOSH RIGHT BY DEAN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAY I AM THE SONG. OKAY VERY GOOD ON MY END. MY NAME IS DAY I AM THE CALIFORNIA STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR COURAGE- A FILLING IN FOR SHANNON TO TALK ABOUT MICHELLE IN CHAUCER'S STORY. AFTER YEARS OF TRYING TO GET PREGNANT MICHELLE AND JOSH WERE HEARTBROKEN TO LEARN THEIR FIRST PREGNANCY WOULD NOT SURVIVE. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY THE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL MISSION VIEJO CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY WERE BEING TREATED. SHANE THEM JUDGE THEIR CHOICES AND DELAYED MICHELLE'S MEDICAL MEDICAL CARE. THERE BY THREATENING HER HEALTH THE SHARED THEIR STORY WITH THE ALL CARE EVERYWHERE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGN. THIS IS OUR STORY. MY HUSBAND A LITTLE BIT YES. THOUGHT BETTER. MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FOR YEARS TO HAVE A CHILD AS SOON AS WE FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT OUR DOCTOR TOLD US THE AG HAD IMPLANTED OUTSIDE MY UTERUS AND A TOPIC PREGNANCY. WE WERE DEVASTATED TO LEARN THAT IF THE PREGNANCY CONTINUED I COULD DIE. R. DOCTOR WANTED TO TREAT ME RIGHT AWAY USING A RELATIVELY SIMPLE OUT PATIENT PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY OUR DOCTOR CAN ONLY TREAT ME AT THE NEARBY MISSION HOSPITAL PART OF ST JOSEPH HEALTH. WHICH REQUIRED THAT I UNDERGO A SERIES OF ADDITIONAL ULTRASOUNDS TESTS BLOOD WORK IN PAPERWORK TO ENSURE I WASN'T TRYING TO GET AN ABORTION. THE DOCTOR SAID THIS IS THE TREATMENT. THIS IS THE STANDARD. BUT THE HOSPITAL SAID THEY DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF BACK. INSTEAD OF GETTING THE SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD TREATMENT MY DOCTOR WANTED MY HUSBAND AND I FACED A WALL OF RED TAPE. AND DELAYING TREATMENT OF THE NECK TOPIC PREGNANCY WOULD HAVE TO PUT MY HEALTH AND LIFE AT RISK. IT WAS A QUESTION OF MY SURVIVAL VERSES AN EMBRYO THAT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE IT HAS NO CHANCE OF SURVIVING. FOR THEM TO PASS JUDGMENT TO QUESTION IF I'M JUST MAKING UP AN EXCUSE FOR TERMINATION IS INSULTING. THIS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION OPPOSED THEIR VERSION OF MORALITY ON ME. I WAS SO ANGRY THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO SHE ME AND CALL ME A LIAR. INSTEAD OF GETTING MEDICALLY REQUIRED TREATMENT FOR MY DOCTOR IN THE HOSPITAL MY OWN COMMUNITY I HAD TO FIND A NEW OBGYN. AND UNDERGO A MORE INVASIVE PROCEDURE UNDER GENERAL ANESTHESIA. THE LOSS OF THE PREGNANCY WAS PAINFUL ENOUGH BUT THIS DELAY FORCED ME TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK. AND KERR NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL MEDICAL EXPENSES BUT ALSO THE EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL BURDEN OF ANXIOUSLY WAITING TO TERMINATE A MUCH DESIRED PREGNANCY THAT COULD NOT SURVIVE. I WAS GOING THROUGH SUCH A HARD TIME AND THEY MADE IT WORSE. THIS SITUATION ROCK MY FAITH IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. AND IS MADE ME AND MY HUSBAND QUESTION WHETHER QUESTION WHETHER WE CAN CONTINUE TO TRY TO HAVE A FAMILY. WE'VE CONSIDERED GIVING UP BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE ARE DENIED CARE BECAUSE SOME RELIGION WE DON'T EVEN BELONG TO. TELLS US WHAT MORALITY IS. WE ARE TELLING OUR STORY TODAY BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THEY ARE NOT ALONE. THAT THEY DO NOT NEED TO TAKE ON THE JUDGMENT OR SHAMING OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO CARE FOR THEM. IF OUR STORY CAN HELP ONE PERSON FEEL LESS ALONE AND PERHAPS MAKE A CHANGE AND IT WILL BE WORTH IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THE POWERFUL STORY. I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MISS FRIEDMAN AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY. MY NAME IS LAURIE FRIEDMAN I'M A MEDICAL SOCIOLOGIST AND A BIOETHICIST. AND I'VE BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH ABOUT CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE RESTRICTIONS FOR MANY YEARS. WHAT THAT RESEARCH HAS REVEALED HAS CONCERNING IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT AUTONOMY AND THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. CATHOLIC HEALTH INSTITUTIONS OCCUPY A SIZEABLE SECTOR OF THE WHOLE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX HOSPITALS AS YOU HEARD- HOSPITAL BEDS IN THE UNITED STATES IS IN A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL WHERE OF THE RELIGIOUS POLICIES GOVERN CARE. HOWEVER IT IS QUITE VARIABLE BY STATE IN SEVERAL STATES ABOUT 30% OF HOSPITAL BEDS ARE IN CATHOLIC INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE OHIO COLORADO ILLINOIS AND IOWA. OVER 40% OF HOSPITAL BEDS ARE IN CATHOLIC FACILITIES IN WASHINGTON STATE ALASKA SOUTH DAKOTA AND WISCONSIN. NATIONALLY THE CATHOLIC SECTOR OF THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HAS EXPERIENCE CONTINUOUS GROWTH SINCE THE NINETIES- EVEN AS OTHER SECTORS START TO SHRINK PART OF THAT GROWTH HAS COME FROM MERGERS ARE PARTNERSHIPS OF SECULAR INSTITUTIONS FURTHER ROADING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. AT THIS POINT THE PROPORTION OF CATHOLIC HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE CARE. IN OUR STATE IF THEY CONTINUE TO GROW. MODERN CATHOLIC HOSPITALS A COME TO LOOK AND FEEL LIKE MOST OTHER US HOSPITALS WHAT MAKES THEM UNIQUE IS THAT. CATHOLIC HOSPITALS MUST FOLLOW THE US BISHOPS RELIGIOUS POLICIES FOR CARE AS YOU HEARD ABOUT THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES SOMETIMES CALLED THE RD'S. THESE POLICIES RESTRICT A BROAD RANGE OF CARE INCLUDING CONTRACEPTION STERILISATION FERTILITY TREATMENT MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT GENDER AFFIRMING CARE AND OF COURSE ABORTION. THE IRAQIS DON'T SIT WELL WITH MANY DOCTORS A NATIONAL SURVEY FOUND THAT 52% OF OBGYN WHO WORKING CATHOLIC HOSPITALS REPORT CONFLICT WITH THEIR HOSPITAL'S RELIGIOUS POLICIES FOR CARE. HOSPITAL POLICIES IN THE PEOPLE WITHIN THEM HAVE CHANGED ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT WAS LIKELY THAT PATIENTS AND EMPLOYEES OF CATHOLIC HOSPITALS WERE LARGELY CATHOLIC AND WANTED CARE DELIVERED ACCORDING TO CATHOLIC DOCTRINE. TODAY CATHOLIC HOSPITALS EMPLOYEE AND SIR SERVED DIVERSE POPULATIONS. RESEARCH SHOWSTHAT PATIENTS CATHOLIC OR NOT REALLY CHOOSE A HOSPITAL BASED UPON ITS RELIGION AND INSTEAD PRIORITIZE FACTORS SUCH AS QUALITY INSURANCE GEOGRAPHY. THE DIRECTIVE DO NOT REFLECT THE NEEDS OF PREFERENCES OF EVEN THE CATHOLIC WOMEN WHO DO USE THEM NEVER MIND THE REST OF THE POPULATION THEY SERVE. EVEN THOUGH NEARLY ALL AMERICAN WOMEN HAVE USED CONTRACEPTION IN THEIR LIFETIME. AND ONLY 8% OF CATHOLIC WOMEN FEEL CONTRACEPTION IS MORALLY WRONG. THE DIRECTIVES MANDATE THE CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS MAY NOT PROMOTER CONDONE CONTRACT CONTRACEPTIVE PRACTICES. AND WHILE A THIRD OF AMERICAN WOMEN INCLUDING CATHOLIC WOMEN RELY ON STERILIZATION TO LIMIT THEIR FAMILIES SIZE THE DIRECTIVES STRICTLY PROHIBITED. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS ETHICAL PROBLEM A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY AGREE WITH CATHOLIC DIRECTIVES THEN THE PROPORTION OF PROVIDERS REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY THEM. SO FUNDS INCLINED ARGUE WELL PATIENTS SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE AND PROVIDER SHOULD WORK ELSEWHERE THAT'S NOT REALISTIC GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS HAVE GROWN FAR BEYOND. THEIR APPROPRIATE FOOT PRINTS. OCCUPYING HEALTHCARE TERRITORY THAT COMPREHENSIVE PROVIDERS NOW CANNOT. TODAY CLERGY HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THE DAY TO DAY RUNNING OF THE HOSPITAL AND MARKETING HAS SOUGHT TO DE CABALLOS AS THE IMAGE OF MANY OF THE HOSPITALS. THIS CAN MAKE IT HARD FOR PATIENTS TO ANTICIPATE AND AVOID THE RESTRICTIONS. A NATIONAL SURVEY SHOWED THAT 37% OF WOMEN WHOSE OWN HOSPITAL WAS CATHOLIC I. DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS. AND AMONG THE WOMEN WHO DO KNOW THAT THE HOSPITAL'S CATHOLIC. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE CARE THAT THEY'LL RECEIVE. 70% EXPECT STERILIZATION TO BE AVAILABLE BIRTH CONTROL. 42% THINK YOU CAN GET AN ABORTION FOR FETAL ANOMALY. BUT THE DIRECTIVES PROHIBIT ALL OF THESE THINGS. IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS TREAT THE POOR MORE THAN OTHER HOSPITALS HOWEVER NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA THEY PREFER PROVIDE ONLY AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF MEDICAID AND CHARITY CARE. AND THEY DO SO USING PUBLIC FUNDS AND INSURANCE DOT DOLLARS LIKE OTHER HOSPITALS NOT MONEY FROM THE CHURCH NONETHELESS IN NINETEEN STATES WOMEN OF COLOR ARE OVER REPRESENTED AMONG CATHOLIC HOSPITAL OBSTETRIC PATIENTS MEANING THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO NEED REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN A RELIGIOUSLY RESTRICTIVE CONTEXT THAN WHITE WMEN. IN A RECENT STUDY OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS IN ILLINOIS SHOWED THAT BLACK AND LATINO WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE WOMEN TO BE ENROLLED IN PLANS THAT SKEWED HEAVILY TOWARD CATHOLIC HOSPITALS MEANING THEY HAD LESS ON COMPREHENSIVE CARE OPTIONS. ALL OF THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO EXISTING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL HEALTH WOMEN OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO FAMILY PLANNING BARRIERS AND SUB STANDARD PRACTICES FOR OBGYN COMPLICATIONS WHICH I'LL EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL IN A MOMENT. THE BISHOPS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE ARE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THEY RUN COUNTER TO BEST PRACTICES IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY FAMILY PLANNING AND TRANS GENDER CARE AND FROM RESULT IN DISCRIMINATORY IN SUBSTANDARD CARE. WELL RESEARCH HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED THAT EVIDENCE BASED FAMILY PLANNING METHODS ARE WIDELY EMBRACED BY WOMEN IN CRITICAL TO THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THE DIRECTIVES PROHIBIT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FROM PROVIDING THEM AND WOMEN FROM RECEIVING THE CARE THEY SHOULD BE GETTING. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS AGREE THAT A NEW MOTHERS CONTRACEPTIVE NEEDS ARE IDEALLY ADDRESSED IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER DELIVERY. BEFORE RETURNING HOME TO TAKE CARE OF A NEWBORN AND OFTEN OTHER CHILDREN AS WELL. THIS IS A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY IF SHE DESIRES A STERILIZATION. IN ONE STUDY HALF OF WOMEN WHO WERE DENIED A WANTED STERILIZATION EXPERIENCED AN UNINTENDED PREGNANCY WITHIN A YEAR. IF A NEW MOTHER MUST HAVE A SEPARATE STERILIZATION PROCEDURE ELSEWHERE LATER SHE HAS THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF SURGERY AND ANESTHESIA ESPECIALLY SHE WAS HAVING A C. SECTION ANYWAY. CATHOLIC POSSIBLE OBSTETRICIANS I INTERVIEWED FOR MY RESEARCH TOLD ME THAT WHILE THEY- MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO DIRECT SOME PATIENTS TO DELIVER ELSEWHERE IF THEY WANT ACCESS TO STERILIZATION SOMETIMES PATIENTS GOING TO LABOR LABOR AND JUST SHOW UP TO THE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL NEEDING WHAT THEY CAN'T PROVIDE. ONE DOCTOR SAID EVERY TIME I'M ON CALL AND PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE BECAUSE I FEEL I CAN'T LOOK INTO A PATIENT'S ABDOMEN AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED. COMMIT MALPRACTICE. I MEAN TO GO. TO CLOSE SOMEONE UP AND SAY YOU NEED ANOTHER OPERATION IS JUST MALPRACTICE. PATIENTS WHO WERE DENARD DENIED POSTPARTUM STERILIZATION VOICE FRUSTRATION AND REGRET. I INTERVIEWED A WOMAN WHOSE DOCTOR HAD HAD TRIED TO GET AN EXCEPTION TO THE STERILIZATION POLICY FOR HER BASED UPON A MEDICAL CONDITION SHE HAD BUT THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AT THE COULD ETHICS COMMITTEE REFUSED SHE SAID. QUOTE IF YOU LOOK AT ME FROM A MEDICAL STANDPOINT I'M NOT AGOOD PREGNANT PERSON I AM AT HIGHER RISK OF DYING BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT SO IT'S RIDICULOUS TO ME YOU KNOW YOUR DOCTOR SAYING YEAH BUT THE HOSPITAL BOARD SAYING NO SO SORRY WHO ARE YOU TO SAY. UNQUOTE NOT BEING ALLOWED CONTRACEPTION AND STERILIZATION CAN BE EXTRAORDINARILY CONFUSING TO PATIENTS WHO ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE SOCIAL DISAPPROVAL OF ABORTION. BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WOULD RESTRICT THE MEANS OF PREVENTING AT. FOR EXAMPLE ONE PATIENT I INTERVIEWED DELIVERED PREMATURE TWINS. AND A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL AND WAS UNABLE TO RECEIVE THE STERILIZATION SHE DESIRED WHERE SHE WAS ALSO DENIED CONTRACEPTION AFTER THE BIRTH BOTH IN THE HOSPITAL AND IN HER PHYSICIANS CLINIC WHICH WAS OWNED BY THE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL. WHEN ASKED HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THIS SHE SAID QUOTE. I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I WANTED TO PREVENT GETTING PREGNANT AGAIN AND THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ME WITH THE RESOURCES LIKE IN THIS CASE BIRTH CONTROL I FELT LIKE I WAS PRACTICALLY BEING OBLIGATED TO NOT TAKE BIRTH CONTROL. AND QUOTE. IN SOME CATHOLIC HOSPITALS PROVIDERS ACTUALLY DO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTION BUT THEY DO SO. BY USING A PRETEXT THAT THE PATIENT NEEDS BIRTH CONTROL FOR A DIFFERENT. NON CONTRACEPTIVE REASON. AND GIVE THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THAT REASON HOWEVER THIS CAN ALSO BE VERY CONFUSING FOR PATIENTS- I INTERVIEWED ONE WOMAN WHO SAID I ULTIMATELY HAD. AN UNDERSTANDING PROVIDER WHO WENT SO YOUR CRAMPS ARE REALLY BAD WINK WINK WINK AT ME AND I WENT. NO I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY HAD CRAMP IN MY LIFE AND HE SAID ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE NEVER HAD A CRAMP BECAUSE I'M HEARING YOUR CRAMPS ARE REALLY BAD. AND HE WAS ULTIMATELY ABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE PRESCRIPTION FOR THE PILLS. SO SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED. I DOCTOR I INTERVIEWED- FOUND THIS RITUAL TO BE ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF WORKING UNDER KEPT THE BISHOPS POLICIES ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK. SHE SAID QUOTE WE HAD PATIENTS THAT WERE VERY SICK WHO ARE PREGNANT AND REALLY NEEDED NOT TO EVER GET PREGNANT AGAIN. WOULD SIMPLY BE CLOSED UP RIGHT AFTER C. SECTION AND SENT OUT TO HAVE A TUBAL LIGATION DONE AT AN OUTSIDE INSTITUTION. AND YOU KNOW PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T GET THE THAT THEY HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM FOR CONTRACEPTION. THE DID ACT GET. WHEN OULD SAY WELL YOU'RE- ARE YOU. UNQUOTE THIS POSITION NOT TO PRESS IN CAP HOSPITALS FOR BECAUSE A THE WAY SUCH RESTRICTIONS DENIED THESE WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY. WOMEN HAVING MISCARRIAGES WHO SEE CARE AT CATHOLIC HOSPITALS MAY ALSO FACE RESTRICTED CARE. THIS ARISES BECAUSE ABORTIONS ARE COMPLETELY PROHIBITED BY THE DIRECTIVES DOCTORS REPORT THAT THEY MUST TEST FOR FETAL HEART BEATS EVEN WHEN A MISCARRIAGE IS CLEARLY INEVITABLE. IF A HEART BEAT IS DETECTED THEN THEY MUST WAIT FOR SIGNS OF INFECTION BEFORE TREATING. THIS IS NOT STANDARD PRACTICE IN A NON RELIGIOUS SETTING WERE OBGYN CARES MORE PATIENT CENTERED. AND MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT IS OFFERED TO REDUCE PAIN AND RISK TO A WOMAN'S LIFE AND HEALTH SUCH WAITING CAN CAUSE DISTRESS FOR BOTH THE PATIENT AND THE PHYSICIAN. ONE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL OBGYN IT I INTERVIEWED EXPLAINED QUOTE. WE OFTEN TELL PATIENTS WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING IN THE HOSPITAL WHAT BUT WATCH YOU GET INFECTED AND WE OFTEN ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A HOSPITAL THAT WOULD GO AHEAD AND GET THEM DELIVERED BEFORE THEY GET INFECTED IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM THERE ALREADY AND A HARD PLACE WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE PATIENTS DISCHARGE THEMSELVES DRIVE THEMSELVES AND THEN ADMIT THEMSELVES TO THE NEXT INSTITUTION. ON QUOTE. ANOTHER POSITION A HIGH RISK OBSTETRICIAN I INTERVIEWED RECEIVED A TRANSFER PATIENT IN HER REMOTE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL FACILITY WHOSE WATER HAD BROKEN BEFORE VIABILITY. THE FETUS. IT TURNED OUT HAD MULTIPLE HEART. ABNORMALITIES NOT COMPATIBLE WITH LIFE. THEY CONSULTED SPECIALISTS AND THE DOCTORS DISCUSS THE POOR PROGNOSIS WITH THE PATIENT. AND THE PATIENT ASK THEM TO GO AHEAD AND INDUCE LABOR ITH THE MEDICATION RATHER THAN WAITING FOR INFECTION. USING MEDICATION IN THIS SCENARIO AGAIN AS STANDARD PRACTICE IN MOST SAID SETTINGS BUT THE PHYSICIAN WAS REPRIMANDED AND ACCUSED BY LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE- OF VIOLATING THE ABORTION POLICY. UPSET BY BEING REPRIMANDED FOR DELIVERING APPROPRIATE CARE PER THE FIELD OF HIGH RISK OBSTETRICS THE DOCTOR WARNED HER LEADERSHIP THAT SHE WOULD START TURNING AWAY ALL PATIENT TRANSFERS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR WEEKS. BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE THE HOSPITAL WOULD ALLOW HER TO MANAGE THEM PER THE STANDARD OF CARE. ANOTHER OBGYN WHO WORKED AT A CATHOLIC FACILITY DESCRIBED A PARTICULARLY DISTRESSING CASE OF A WOMAN WITH A TWIN PREGNANCY THAT HAD GONE WRONG. WHO SHOWED UP TO THE HOSPITAL BLEEDING. AND THERE WAS ONE. HEALTHY APPEARING PREGNANCY BUT THE OTHER WAS A MOLAR PREGNANCY. A MOLAR PREGNANCY IS ONE THAT CANNOT SURVIVE I'M- AND THE TISSUE CAN BECOME CANCEROUS. THREATENING A WOMAN'S LIFE SO THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS IS TO EVACUATE THE UTERUS COMPLETELY AND IN SOME CASES TREAT WITH CHEMO MEDICATIONS. THE DOCTOR ASKED THE CATHOLIC ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR PERMISSION TO TERMINATE THE PREGNANCY BUT THERE BECAUSE OF HER MEDICAL CONDITION THEY REFUSED AND TOLD HER TO SEND THE PATIENT ELSEWHERE. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE PATIENTS EXPERIENCE BEING DENIED GENDER CONFIRMING SURGERY. I WAS ABLE TO INTERVIEW BOTH THE PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR IN THIS CASE. WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE EXPERIENCE OF EVAN MINTON WHO IS SPEAKING TODAY AS WELL. THE DOCTOR HAD PERFORMED. GYNECOLOGICAL SURGERY ON THE PATIENT'S MOTHER IN HIS CATHOLIC HOSPITAL AND THEY HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP SO. THE MOTHER AND THE PHYSICIAN THOUGHT- HE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME SURGERY FOR HER TRIP TRANSITIONING SON. BUT A NURSE CALLED THE SUN PRIOR TO SURGERY TO GO OVER SOME DETAILS AND SHE STARTED ASKING MEDICALLY IRRELEVANT QUESTIONS- HE SAID QUOTE. I NOTICED THE QUESTIONS WERE VERY PERSONAL LIKE SHE WOULD ASK ME WHAT WAS I GETTING AND I TOLD HER WHAT I WAS GETTING WHICH WAS A HYSTERECTOMY AND WHATEVER AND THEN SHE WAS SORT OF LIKE WHY. I BRIEFLY JUSTANSWER DO I'M GOING UNDERGOING A GENDER REASSIGNMENT CHANGE YOU KNOW AND SHE WAS. LIKE WHY SHE JUST KEPT ASKING WHY AT A DAY AFTER THAT AND THEN A DAY AFTER THAT WHEN MY DOCTOR CALLED ME I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER HE WAS LIKE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WHEN I INTERVIEWED THE DOCTOR ABOUT IT HE RECALL GETTING A PHONE CALL TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE THE SURGERY SAYING THE PROCEDURE COULD NOT BE DONE ON A TRANSGENDER PERSON. HE PLEADED WITH THEM BECAUSE THE PATIENT I'VE BEEN WAITING AND NEEDED THIS TO HAPPEN IN A SHORT WINDOW OF TIME FOR MEDICAL AND LOGISTICAL REASONS AND THEY SAID NOW. AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT WE'VE TAKEN IT OFF THE BOOKS. PHYSICIANS RESPONDED TO THE CONSTRAINTS SORRY POSITIONS RESPOND TO THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE RELIGIOUS POLICIES IN VARIOUS WAYS. TRANSFERRING PATIENTS ELSEWHERE FALSIFYING CHARTS. ARE MISDIAGNOSED IN PATIENTS TO WORK AROUND RESTRICTIONS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL. DEALING CARE UNTIL IT IS THEOLOGICALLY JUSTIFIED IN ORDER TO SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE OR SIMPLY DENYING IT WITH NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE. I HOPE I HAVE CONVEYED HOW RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS CAN TIE THE HANDS OF DOCTORS AND CONSERVE SUBJECT PATIENTS TO THE LOGISTICAL MEDICAL AND EMOTIONAL HARM A TO NILES. AND MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES LIKETHE ONES THAT SHARE TODAY THE E. R. D. IS ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE DOCTORS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CERTAIN PATIENTS AND TO PRACTICE OF STANDARD OBGYN CARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISREAD AND LIKE MANY WOMEN I'VE EXPERIENCED A MISCARRIAGE AND I CAN'T IMAGINE BEING IN THE KIND OF CARE THAT YOU DESCRIBE TODAY SO GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION. I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO MISS BURLINGAME. TO GIVE US HER OPENING REMARKS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PHILIP BURLINGAME AND I'M THE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND GENDER EQUITY DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING. A HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. I'D LIKE TO START MY REMARKS BY SAYING THAT IT THE ACLU WE HAVE ALWAYS STAUNCHLY DEFENDED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS A CORE AMERICAN VALUE. FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MEANS THE ABILITY TO PRACTICE ONE'S OWN RELIGION OR TO NOT PRACTICE ONE. IT DOES NOT MEAN THE RIGHT TO IMPOSE ONE'S RELIGION ON OTHERS. AS PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN STATED CATHOLIC HOSPITALS DO NOT ONLY HIRE CATHOLIC PROVIDERS OR SERVE CATHOLIC PATIENTS WHO SEEK RELIGIOUSLY RESTRICTED CARE. ON THE CONTRARY THESE HOSPITALS HIGHER PROVIDERS OF MANY FAITHS AND NO FAITH. AND THEY'RE OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHAT HAPPENS IN PRACTICE THEN IS THAT THE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES AND UP IMPOSING RELIGION ON MANY. IF NOT MOST OF THEIR PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. INCREASINGLY CATHOLIC HOSPITALS ALSO VIE WITH SECULAR HOSPITALS FOR MARKET SHARE. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE HOSPITALS THE FOLLOW THE CATHOLIC ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN THAT IMPOSE A LESSER DEGREE OF CATHOLIC RESTRICTIONS ON CARE. MORE THAN ONE IN SIX HOSPITAL BEDS IN CALIFORNIA IS IN A CATHOLIC FACILITY AND THE LARGEST HOSPITAL PROVIDER IN THE STATE IS DIGNITY HEALTH A CATHOLIC SYSTEM. AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED DIGNITY HEALTH MERCH AND TWENTY NINETEEN WITH CATHOLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES AND THE COMBINED ENTITY IS NOW THE SECOND LARGEST NONPROFIT HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE NATION. AFTER ASCENSION HEALTH ANOTHER CATHOLIC SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE MERGER DID NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS IN THE STATE CONSOLIDATION PROVIDES IT AND OTHER CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WITH THE STRENGTHENED POSITION AND THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE. IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IS THE ONLY OPTION. FOR EXAMPLE IN REDDING PREACH. PREGNANT PATIENTS HAVE NO CHOICE OTHER THAN MERCY MEDICAL CENTER A DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITAL FOR SEVENTY MILES BUT ACCESSING PREGNANCY RELATED CARE AT MERCY OR ANOTHER CATHOLIC HOSPITAL MEANS SUBJECTING ONESELF TO RELIGIOUS RULES THAT OVERRIDE PATIENT AUTONOMY AN EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE. THESE RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS CAN PUT PREGNANT PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND EVEN LIVES AT RISK AS WE HEARD FROM A SHELL AND JOSH'S STORY. AT THE ACLU WE'RE LITIGATING THREE CASES IN CALIFORNIA AGAINST CATHOLIC HOSPITALS FOR DENIAL OF CARE. I'M GONNA DISCUSS THEM BRIEFLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ILLUSTRATE BOTH THE STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LAW AND THE DANGEROUS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ARGUMENTS BEING MADE BY THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS. PUBLIC HOSPITALS LIKE ALL OTHER HOSPITALS ARE SUBJECT BOTH TO THE STATE'S HOSPITAL LICENSING LAWS INTO THE UNRUH ACT CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAW. BUT IN OUR CASES THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS GO SO FAR AS TO ARGUE THAT THEY ARE AKIN TO A CHURCH. AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THESE LAWS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA PATIENCE. IS PROBABLY UNNECESSARY TO DETAIL FOR YOU HOW THE CHURCH AN INSTITUTION THAT PROVIDES RELIGIOUS SERVICES TO AN EMPLOYEES AND SERVICE PEOPLE OF ITS OWN FAITH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM HOSPITAL TREATING THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN OUR FIRST CASE TOMORROW VERSES DIGNITY HEALTH THE ACLU IN COVINGTON AND BURLING ARE SUING DIGNITY HEALTH ON BEHALF OF REBEKAH TOMORROW AND PHYSICIANS FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. RELATING TO THE DENIAL OF POST PARTUM TUBAL LIGATION. AS WE HEARD FROM PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN PROVIDING A TUBAL LIGATION DIRECTLY AFTER CHILDBIRTH IS THE STANDARD OF CARE. BUT CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AVE A RELIGIOUS POLICY AGAINST PROVIDING CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES AND THEREFORE ROUTINELY DENY PATIENTS THIS IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER AS WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE LAWSUIT THE SITUATION IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IN FACT MANY CATHOLIC HOSPITALS DO PROVIDE SOME TUBAL LIGATION TO SOME PATIENTS. HOW THEY DO SO IS BOTH DEEPLY TROUBLING AND IN VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA LAW. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE ACTED TO BAN WHAT WAS THEN DISTURBING COMMON PRACTICE. HOSPITAL'S DENYING ACCESS TO TUBAL LIGATION IS BASED ON THEIR ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THE PREGNANT PERSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STOP HAVING CHILDREN. THIS WAS THE FLIP SIDE OF THE EGREGIOUS EUGENICS POLICY THAT INFLICTED STERILIZATION ON OTHER PEOPLE PRIMARILY WOMEN OF COLOR AGAINST THEIR WILL. THE TOOL HOSPITALS USED KNOWN AS THE ONE TWENTY RULE. REQUIRED THE PREGNANT PERSONS AGE MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN REACH THE NUMBER ONE TWENTY BEFORE THEY'RE ENTITLED TO A TUBAL LIGATION. THE LAW NOW STATES THAT HAVE HOSPITALS PROVIDE ANY STERILIZATION OPERATIONS THEY MAY NOT USE NON MEDICAL CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHICH STERILIZATIONS TO PROVIDE. DESPITE THIS CLEAR LAW DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT IS PROHIBITED STRIPPING PATIENTS OF THEIR ECONOMY AND MEDICAL DECISION MAKING AND USING AGE NUMBER OF BIRTHS AND OTHER NON MEDICAL CRITERIA TO DECIDE TO WHICH PATIENTS THEY WILL PERMIT A TUBAL LIGATION. THE FINAL DECISION IS MADE BY A NUN NOT A MEDICAL PROVIDER. THE OTHER TWO CASES PERTAIN TO DENIALS OF GENDER FIRMING HYSTERECTOMIES TO TRANSGENDER MAN. EVAN MINTON ONE OF OUR CLIENTS IS HERE TO TELL HIS POWERFUL STORY SO I WILL LEAVE THAT TO HIM. BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BOTH MISTER MINTON AND OLIVER NIGHT WHO WAS DENIED CARE AT SAINT JOSEPH HOSPITAL IN EUREKA. WERE DENIED CARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE TRANSGENDER THE ESSENCE OF IDENTITY BASED DISCRIMINATION THAT THE UNDER ACT IS INTENDED TO PROTECT AGAINST. CATHOLIC HOSPITALS INCLUDING THE HOSPITALS THAT DENIED CARE TO MISTER MINTON AND MISTER KNIGHT REGULARLY PROVIDE HYSTERECTOMIES TO CISGENDER WOMEN AND IN FACT HAD SCHEDULED THE PROCEDURES FOR BOTH OF OUR CLIENTS IT WAS ONLY WHEN THE HOSPITAL'S LEARNED THAT MISTER KNIGHT AND MISTER MINTON OR TRANS GENDER. THAT THEY DENIED THEM CARE. WITH RESPECT TO MISTER MINTON DIGNITY HEALTH HAS ARGUED THAT THEY DID NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HIM BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO ACCESS CARE AND A NON CATHOLIC DIGNITY HEALTH FACILITY AT A LATER TIME. SIMILARLY PROPONENTS OF AFFILIATIONS BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT IMPOSE RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON YOU SEE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. ARGUE THAT IF YOU SEE PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO TRANSFER DENIED PATIENTS TO ANOTHER FACILITY THERE PROVIDING APPROPRIATE CARE TO THAT PATIENT. BUT LET'S STEP BACK AND CONSIDER THAT FOR A MOMENT. AT THE HOSPITAL DOES NOT HAVE THE STAFFING LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OR INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN MEDICAL SERVICES TO PATIENTS IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT FOR THEM TO TRANSFER THOSE PATIENTS TO ANOTHER FACILITY. I HAVE A HOSPITAL TRANSFER PATIENTS BASED SOLELY ON THEIR IDENTITY THAT IS SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR LAW IT IS NO DIFFERENT TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER IDENTITY THAT IT WOULD BE FOR HOSPITAL TO REFUSE TO TREAT ME BECAUSE I AM A WOMAN. OR AN ATHEIST. IN ALL THREE OF THESE CASES AS THEY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS ARE ALSO MAKING SWEEPING CONSTITUTIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ARGUMENTS THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO FOLLOW STATE LICENSING LAW AND STATE NONDISCRIMINATION ON. SPECIFICALLY THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PATIENTS THEY PROVIDE THESE SERVICES TO. SO LET'S TAKE THAT AND FOR A SECOND THESE HOSPITALS WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND THE NINE MEDICAL CARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY DEEM AN INDIVIDUAL PATIENT MORALLY WORTHY. THUS FAR THE ONLY APPELLATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE HAS AGREED WITH US BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FEDERAL COURTS. FOR TOO LONG CATHOLIC HOSPITALS HAVE ACTED WITH IMPUNITY AND MANY HAVE LISTEN TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE ACTING FOR THE GREATER GOOD. BUT THEY'RE DENYING CARE AND THEY'RE DISCRIMINATING. IT IS TIME TO SHINE A LIGHT ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN THESE HOSPITALS AND IT'S TIME TO HOLD OUR STATE INSTITUTIONS LIKE YOU SEE. ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEIR PARTNERSHIPS FACILITATE THESE RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES. FREEDOM OF RELIGION SHOULD NOT MEAN A LICENSE TO DISCRIMINATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS BROWN GAME FOR THAT POWERFUL TESTIMONY TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR STATE. MISTER MINTON I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER TO YOU TO TELL YOUR STORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. MERRY BAND. WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THINK TO CHAMPION. RIGHT HERE AND SHARE OUR QUE HAN AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER COM WALKER SEC I'M MY NAME IS EVAN MEN CAN AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND WHILE SPEAKING OUT CAN BE CHALLENGING HELP ME FURTHER RECLAIM MY VOICE IN MY POWER AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I'VE GIVEN MY STORY BEFORE CONGRESS TWO WEEKS AGO. BEFORE THE BOARD OF REGENTS UC BOARD OF REGENTS IN MAY I AM IN THE NEW YORK TIMES AN OFFICIAL COURT DOCUMENTS. IN INTO MANY MEDIA OUTLETS TO KEEP TRACK OF. THAT MY TESTIMONY AT THIS HEARING WILL BE A BIT DIFFERENT FOR ME. THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY AS MY FAMILY. AND I PLAN ON OPENING MYSELF UP A BIT MORE. IN GIVING YOU MORE OF MYSELF BECAUSE OF ALL THAT I'VE GOTTEN IN RETURN. I GREW BEEN PRETTY CONSERVATIVE EVER MORE I THINK AT LEAST TWENTY VIEW ON THIS PANEL IS FAMILIAR WITH THAT PLACE. I WAS ONE OF THE I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OPENLY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE THAT I EVER NOW. AND I WAS THAT CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPENLY TRANSGENDER PERSON THAT MY FAMILY EVER NOW. AND AM I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I WAS TRANS INTEL MY LATE TWENTIES. EV BUT I GREW UP WITH A SENSE OF SHAME ABOUT MYSELF NEVER WANTING MYSELF TO BE MY HOME. AND I WENT THROUGH- SO MUCH TO TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT SHAME AND FIND OUT WHERE THAT SHE WAS COMING FROM AND I WENT TO CHURCH I WENT TO COUNSELING BUT I COULD NEVER. REALLY FIND OUT WHY. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS IN A PRODUCTION OF THE **** MONOLOGUES. AND SOME FOLKS MIGHT HAVE SEEN A AT THE CAST INCLUDED. AMY BROWN JODY HEX AND KERRY MARTIN WHO IS HERE TODAY- AND A PART OF A TRANSGENDER WOMAN. AND ALL THE SENATE CLICKED FOR ME. THIS IS A- I'M TRANS GENDER. AND I EXPERIENCED A BRIEF HONEYMOON PERIOD THAT ACT QUICKLY DEVOLVED INTO WHAT I INSTINCTIVELY REFERRED TO AS- THE DARK NIGHTS OF MY SOUL. I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NEVER ACCOMPLISH MY HOPES AND DREAMS BECAUSE OF WHO I AM. AND ONE OF MY HOPES WAS TO WORK IN THE CAPITAL AGAIN. I'D ENTERED THE BUILDING AS A WOMAN NAMED HEATHER. AND THEN LEFT THE BUILDING TO BE A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE. IN MY THOUGHTS. AND MY DREAMS OF RETURNING TO THE CAPITAL TO MAKE WIDESPREAD POSITIVE CHANGE THROUGH THE LAW WE'RE NO LONGER I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER OPEN TO ME. AND I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH THAT HURT. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND I'M PROUD TO BE CONSIDERED THE FIRST OPENLY TRANSPORTATION TO HAVE EVER WORKED AT THE CAPITOL. THAT WHEN I WAS FINALLY READY WHEN I WAS FINALLY READY TO PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THIS IS WHO I AM I MADE THE DECISION TO BE PUBLIC ON FACEBOOK. I KNEW THAT THERE WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE STEPS IN MY TRANSITION THAT WOULD BE NO NOTICEABLE TO PEOPLE AT YOU KNOW WARY NOW CLOTHING EVENTUALLY CHANGING TO MALE PRONOUNS FACIAL HAIR I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE FACIAL HAIR. AND AT THE TIME I FIGURED THAT I COUD EITHER WALK IN MY STORY AND OWN IT OR COULD LOSE CONTROL OF MY NARRATIVE AND SIMPLY SUBJECT MYSELF TO OTHERS TALKING ABOUT AND SPECULATING ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK. AND I CHOSE TO DO MORE OF THE FORMER IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID. THE LATER. BUT THAT SHARING EVOLVED INTO SO MUCH MORE. IT EVOLVED INTO A HUGE COMMUNITY OF SUPPORT. AND WHILE A FACED EGREGIOUS BALLOTS OF BULLYING WITHIN THESE WALLS INCLUDING FROM A CURRENT REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO CORNERED ME IN A RESTROOM. DEMANDING TO KNOW IF I WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN THE LOVE I RECIEVE HERE WAS MORE THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE. AND IT HAS BEEN TRULY HUMBLING AND ON FIRE IN. I KNOW I NEVER GUESSED THAT THIS WOULD BE MY LIFE TODAY. BUT NOT THERE WAS THE SUPPORT MORE OBVIOUS AND NEEDED. THEN WHEN I WAS DENIED MEDICALLY NECESSARY IN TIME SENSITIVE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF WHO I AM. IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF UNDERGOING A SERIES OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS STEMMING FROM MY DIAGNOSIS OF GENDER DYSPHORIA. AFTER MY DOCTORS DETERMINED THAT A HYSTERECTOMY WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY I WAS SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO THE SURGERY AT MERCY SAN JUAN MEDICAL CENTER. AT THE HOSPITAL IN THE DIGNITY HEALTH CHAIN. ANDI DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT WHERE HE SAN JUAN MEDICAL CENTER OR DIGNITY HEALTH BUT I KNEW THAT MY SURGEON REGULARLY PERFORM HYSTERECTOMIES AT THAT HOSPITAL. TWO DAYS BEFORE MY SURGERY DATE I NURSE CALLED ME TO GO OVER THE DETAILS AND I MENTIONED THAT I WAS TRANSGENDER. THE VERY NEXT DAY A DAY BEFORE MY SURGERY BUT SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE. THE HOSPITAL CALLED MY SURGEON TO INFORM HER THAT MY SURGERY HAD BEEN CANCELED. THE REASON BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF MY GENDER TRANSITION. I REMEMBER WHERE I WAS WHEN MY DOCTOR DELIVERED THE NEWS TO ME. SHE CALLED ME AND CALMLY BUT SORROWFULLY BUT ALSO WITH A SENSE OF OUTRAGE TOLD ME THAT WHILE SHE HAD ANOTHER HYSTERECTOMY ON THE BOOKS DIRECTLY AFTER MINE THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS NOT CANCELING. THE HOSPITAL IS CANCELING MY HYSTERECTOMY BECAUSE I AM TRANS GENDER. I WAS IN MY PARENTS HOUSE IN THEIR BEDROOM IN AT THAT MOMENT I WAS SO DEVASTATED THAT I JUST LAPPED TO THE GROUND. BECAUSE I HAD STRUGGLED MY WHOLE LIFE BASED ON WHO I AM AND I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHO I AM AND ACCEPT WHO I AM AND I FELT SO HELPLESS. AND DISTRAUGHT BECAUSE THIS HOSPITAL WAS DENIED ME CARE BASED EXACTLY ON THOSE GROUNDS. HEY ANY A MANY MANY FOLKS IN THIS CAPITAL COMMUNITY HAVE TROUT TRAVELED THAT PORTION OF THE ROAD WITH ME. AFTER THOSE WHO DID AND- NOT ONLY DID THIS CAN'T AT THIS HOSPITAL CANCEL MY SURGERY BUT TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE FACT THAT THE SURGERIES CANCELED THEN PUT ALL OF MY OTHER TREATMENTS THAT I HAD SCHEDULED IN FOR. BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERIENCED DELAYS IN GETTING CARE THAT I NEEDED THE TIMING OF MY HYSTERECTOMY WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. IF I COULDN'T FOLLOW THIS TIGHTLY SCHEDULED COURSE OF TREATMENT MY GENDER DYSPHORIA WOULD GET PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. FOR ME WHAT THAT MEANS IS A FEELING THEY HAVE MORE AND MORE IN SOCIETY A FEELING OF WANTING TO CRAWL OUT OF MY SKIN. IT IT'S MY HEALTH AND IT'S MY WELL BEING. I WAS FORTUNATE THAT- BECAUSE OF MY CONNECTIONS TO PEOPLE IN POWER AND BECAUSE OF MY OWN WILLINGNESS TO BE VOCAL I WAS ABLE TO FIGHT. AND GET MY HYSTERECTOMY PERFORMED AT A DIFFERENT HOSPITAL. BUT THE EXPERIENCE OBVIOUSLY LEAVE SCARS. I HAD NO IDEA PRIOR TO SEEKING A HYSTERECTOMY THAT MY LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL COVERED BY MY INSURANCE WAS A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL OR THAT THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE PERMITS THEM TO DENY MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE JUST BECAUSE A PATIENT HAPPENS TO BE TRANS GENDER. I NOW KNOW THAT THE US CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS WHICH DETERMINES MEDICAL POLICY. FOR MOST DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS BELIEVE THE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. DO NOT EVEN EXIST. THINK ABOUT THAT BISHOPS DETERMINING MEDICAL POLICY OUR TAX FUNDED HOSPITALS THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST TAXPAYERS. SINCE THOSE TWO PHONE CALLS THE ONE WITH THE DIGNITY HEALTH NURSE AND THE ONE WITH MY OWN DOCTOR MY ADVOCACY HAS LED ME IN A NEW DIRECTION. AND I WANT TO SHARE A SAD STATISTIC RIGHT NOW NOT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN SAD ENOUGH ALREADY. BUT AS OPPOSED TO ONE POINT 6% IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE I AM. COMMUNITY WILL ATTEMPT SUICIDE AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFE 40% THIS NUMBER JUMPS TO SIXTY. PERCENT OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED MEDICAL CARE GETTING ANTI TRANS GENDER BIAS. I THAT TO TAKE TO GET FROM THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE OF UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW 60% YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER EXPERIENCING MEDICAL CARE FROM BEING FROM BEING DENIED BEING DISCRIMINATED. THEN YOU ARE LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE THAT'S NUTS IT'S NUTS. I'M SO WHILE I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE FULLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY TRANSITION I FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE SHIRKING MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COMMUNITY IF I DIDN'T CONTINUE THIS FIGHT. NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS. I SIMPLY DON'T WANT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME TO HAPPEN TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IT DOES. TRANSFERABLE A ROAD TEAM ONLY BEING TURNED AWAY BY DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS. AND THIS IS EVEN MORE DEVASTATING AS MY FELLOW PANELISTS HEAD ON. IN RURAL AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO WHERE ELSE TO TURN. AND IN FACT THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES MY EXPERIENCE UNIQUE IS THAT A BECAME HIGH PROFILE. AND I DID YEAH SO RIGHT NOW. I'M A I'M CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN TWO BIG BATTLES. THE FIRST IS MY LAWSUIT THAT THE ACLU ACLU AND FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC HOLDER IS LAW FIRM COVINGTON AND BURLING HAVE FILED ON MY BEHALF AGAINST DIGNITY HEALTH AND THAT WAS AT PUT FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MATT PHELPS AND PHILLIPS REPRESENTS DIGNITY HEALTH AGAINST ME. AND IN OTHER ANTI DISCRIMINATION COURT CASES AGAINST DIGNITY HEALTH. JUST LAST FALL A CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL AGREED WITH ME THAT I SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION WHEN THE HOSPITAL CANCELED MY SURGERY. WHAT MY COURT YEAH I SAID THAT'S FANTASTIC YES STILL A BIT OF GOOD NEWS IN ALL OF THIS YEAH HEY YEAH- I HAVEN'T DONE THE CONFETTI UP YET BUT- WELL MY CASES THEN PENDING IN THE COURTS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAITED SOME. IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE THAT MISS FINE TASTE RAINER MENTIONED EARLIER ENTITLED PROTECTING STATUTORY CONSCIENCE RIGHTS AND HEALTH CARE. AS OPPOSED TO WORKING TO PROTECT PATIENTS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF WHAT I CALL THIS REFUSAL OF CARE ROLE. IS TO ENABLE PEOPLE AND ENTITIES TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PATIENTS AND LIMIT CARE AND THE NAME OF RELIGION. AND ITS ARGUMENT AS TO WHY THIS RULE WAS NECESSARY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MENTIONS THREE COURT CASES. MINE IS ONE OF THEM. PEOPLE OFTEN MISS THE HUMAN TOLL THAT THIS TAKES. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT. ONE MY COURT CASE REMAINS UNDER WAY I'M INVOLVED IN A SECOND FIGHT. TO PREVENT RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON UC PROVIDED HEALTH CARE AND ACTUALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT ON THIS. IS REALLY IMPACTFUL. AND THE UC I BELIEVE IS THE THIRD LARGEST HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IN OUR STATE. AS A U. SEAL I'M I FEEL PARTICULARLY PERSONAL TIED TO THIS. LAST YEAR I WAS PART OF A LARGE COALITION THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN DEFEATING A PROPOSAL TO FORMALIZE IN VASTLY EXPANDED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCSF AND DIGNITY HEALTH. I TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS AND I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THAT VICTORY. IT'S NOT SO WHAT WE DISCOVERED IN THE PROCESS. INCREASINGLY DISTURBED INCREDIBLY DISTURBINGLY HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF THAT FIGHT IT WAS UNCOVERED. THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS HAD PARTNERSHIPS WITH DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS AT EVERY SINGLE UC MEDICAL CENTER. AS AS AS PROFESSOR I CAME OUT H LL SOON TESTIFY THE UC IS NOW SEEKING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THIS TYPE OF PARTNERSHIP THREE NEW GUIDELINES. THE PARTNERSHIPS FORCED THE UC DOCTORS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS PLACED IN THESE RELIGIOUS HOSPITALS TO DENY CARE BASED ON RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE. SOUND FAMILIAR WHICH ALSO IMPACTS ALL SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THAT CARE. ESSENTIALLY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS SANCTIONING AND PARTICIPATING IN THE SAME HARMFUL POLICY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING IN THEIR HARMFUL REFUSAL OF CARE ROLE. IRONICALLY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN'T EVEN IMPLEMENT THEIR ROLE YET BECAUSE THANKFULLY IT'S BEING HELD UP IN THE COURTS. IT'S UNTHINKABLE WHAT THE UC IS DOING RIGHT NOW IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THEIR MARKET SHARE. I FIND IT EVEN MORE TROUBLING. THAT THE UC IS SAYING THAT THEY NEED TO DO A- IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE YES. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ABSOLUTELY NEED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BUT WHAT THESE COMMUNITIES NEED AND DESERVE LIKE EVERY SINGLE OHER COMMUNITY IS ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE SCIENCE BASED HEALTHCARE. IT'S NOT HOSPITALS THAT WILL LIMIT CARE AND THEN BETRAYED THEM IN THEIR TIME OF NEED. ARE YOU SEE BOTH A BOARD OF REGENTS VOTE ON THIS MATTER IS FORTHCOMING. THE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO TESTIFY. AND AS AN ADVOCATE OF COURSE I'M GOING TO MAKE AN ASK. I WON I WON ASK VERY VERY VERY RESPECTFULLY TO PLEASE COME OUT STRONG AGAIN SEE UC'S PARTNERSHIPS WITH RELIGIOUS HOSPITALS THAT-RESTRICT CARE TO PATIENTS. BECAUSE INCREASE MARKET SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE A REASON TO ABANDON OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO EQUALITY. BECAUSE INCREASE MARKET SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE A REASON OUR TAX DOT DOLLARS SUBSIDIZE. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT Q. PEOPLE. AND THOSE SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. BECAUSE INCREASE MARKET SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE A REASON TO PUT PEOPLE'S LIVES AND WELL BEING IN DANGER. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER MINTON FOR THAT INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TESTIMONY I WANT YOU KNOW THAT I'M SURE I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE IN THIS AND DíAS AND I SAY WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AND- YOUR BRAVERY JUST. IS INCREDIBLE AND I KNOW THIS IS HARD FOR YOU ARE ROLE MODEL TO SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE WITH THINGS. I THINK. NOW I WILL TURN OVER TO. THE YOU SEE HAITIAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HEARING US TODAY MY NAME IS LISA IT CAMO TERM A FACULTY MEMBER OF THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW MY PRIMARY AREAS OF WORKER REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND JUSTICE HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES IN BIOETHICS. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TWO TOPICS SO ONE IS THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT THE AFFILIATIONS BETWEEN YOU SEE MEDICAL CENTERS AND HOSPITALS IT RESTRICTS SERVICES. BASED ON RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE AND ALSO THE IMPACTS OF RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- SO BY THE WAY BACKGROUND I AM A MEMBER OF THE UC HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE IN THE SUB COMMITTEE ADVISES. THE UC COMMITTEE ON FACULTY WELFARE ABOUT EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLANS AS WELL AS ACADEMIC. RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ISSUE AND HEALTH AND MEDICINE. AND MANAGEMENT OF YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEMS SO I'M NOT SPEAKING HERE OF TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE TASK FORCE BUT I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT BACKGROUND ABOUT HOW THIS ISSUE AROSE. TO THE UC SYSTEM- SO I'M SPEAKING AS A LEGAL SCHOLAR HIS RESEARCH THE ROLE OF TOPIC HEALTH SYSTEMS- IN THE US SINCE THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES. I'M SO THE TASK FORCE STARTED OF DISCUSSING CONCERNS ABOUT THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS JUST FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND INITIALLY WE FOCUSED ON NETWORKS EFFICIENCY EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLANS. SO THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER EMPLOYEES WERE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS IN THEIR MANAGED CARE NETWORKS. HAD SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO FULL SCOPE OF CARE. THAT THEY NEED WE HAVEN'T QUITE RESOLVED THAT YET. THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN USED YES I HAVE. NOW THAT HAD FORMALIZED AN AFFILIATION WITH THREE DIGNITY HEALTH HOSPITALS IN THE AREA. I AND TWO. EIGHTEEN T. STUDENTS AND OTHER ADVOCATES. AT UCSF CHALLENGE THAT PROPOSED AFFILIATION. SO IT. THE HEALTHCARE TASK FORCE THEN TOOK UP THAT ISSUE- SO IN RESPONSE THE COMMITTEE ON FACT WELFARE SET UP A STEP COMMITTEE. CALL THE NON DISCRIMINATION AND HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE LAURIE FRIEDMAN AND I WERE BOTH MEMBERS. OF THAT TASK FORCE OR SUBCOMMITTEE THAT SUBCOMMITTEE ROTARY. THAT I CONCERNS IN CONFLICTS CAN ARISE WHEN THE YOU SEE HEALTH CENTERS AFFILIATE WITH HOSPITALS. FOUND BY THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES FOR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE TASK FORCE ISSUED A REPORT LAST SUMMER. THE FACULTY COUNCIL ENDORSED THAT REPORT AND THEN FORWARDED IT TO YOU SEE PRESIDENT OF APOLLO TANA ON JULY THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SO THE TASK FORCE REPORT- INCLUDES A SERIES OF KEY FINDINGS AND THEY INCLUDE THE STATEMENT. THE MISSION VALUES AND POLICIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AS EXPRESSED IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. REGION'S POLICIES AND ACADEMIC PERSONNEL MANUAL ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE USE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF FOR SECTARIAN DOCTRINE. THAT RESTRICTS OUR EXPENSE HEALTH CARE AND DISCRIMINATORY WAYS. THE TASK FORCE REPORT IDENTIFIES POTENTIAL HARMS TO THE UC'S MISSION AND VALUES ITS ABILITY TO TRAIN MEDICAL STUDENTS. ITS FACULTY ITS ABILITY TO DELIVER EVIDENCE BASED HEALTH CARE AND TO ITS PATIENTS. IN THE LAST SECTION THE REPORT SETS OUT PRINCIPLES FOR AVOIDANCE OF DISCRIMINATION AND HEALTH CARE. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LIST THEM ALL BUT I'LL MENTION TO. IN SIMPLE TO STATES THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT BE A MEMBER IN AN ENTITY THAT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE SERVICES WITH ANOTHER MEMBER THAT HAS DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES. ARE POLICIES AND HEALTH CARE. AND THEN THE SECOND ONE PRINCIPLE FOR THE NO MENTION. OF STATES IN PART ALL CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SHOULD AFFIRMATIVELY INCLUDE TERMS THAT REQUIRE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THEUNIVERSITY PRINCIPLES VALUES AND PRACTICES. SO THE ISSUE MOVE FORWARD OR UP REALLY IN FALL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRESIDENT APOLLO TANO SET UP A WORKING GROUP TO CONSIDER THESE ISSUES. PROFESSOR GOOD WHEN AS YOU HEARD WAS A MEMBER OF THE WORKING GROUP. OF THE WORKING GROUP DID NOT DEVELOP A CONSENSUS- WE EXPECTED THE REPORT IN DECEMBER IN AS A STRUGGLE TO FIND THE CAME OUT IN LATE JANUARY- SO RATHER IT ISSUE THE CHAIR'S REPORT AND LETTER SUBMITTED BY INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL MEMBERS OF THE WORKING GROUP. IN THE MEANTIME THE ACLU'S WHOSE USE OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REVEALED THAT EVERY YOU SEE HEALTH CARE CENTER- HAVE AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS WITH HOSPITALS THAT USE THE E. R. TEASE OR ETHICAL RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES. AND THAT BOUND UC FACULTY AND STUDENTS TO ABIDE BY THE E. R. DISS BUT BOTH PROFESSOR GOOD ONE AND AT THE NET AND HAVE MENTIONED. THE CHAIR'S REPORT WAS ISSUED AS I SAID IN LATE JANUARY. OPTION AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT SETS OUT TWO OPTIONS- WAYS OF GOING FORWARD OPTION ONE WOULD ALLOW AFFILIATIONS WITH HOSPITALS THE PROHIBITS SERVICES FOR WOMEN WOMEN. AND FOR LGBT Q. PEOPLE OPTION TWO WOULD EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDE THOSE PLUGS PRECLUDE THOSE AFFILIATIONS SO THESE TWO OPTIONS ARE NOW SHAPING THE DEBATE THAT'S TAKING PLACE AND AS EVAN MINT MENTIONED THE REGIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO CONSIDER THEM IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. SOME GONNA SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THOSE TWO OPTIONS I'M NOT GONNA DESCRIBE THEM IN GREAT DETAIL BUT MENTION A COUPLE OF POINTS. GENERALLY SPEAKING THE. THE BOTH OPTIONS OUT OVERLAPPING BUT NOT I DON'T LIST OF SEVEN PRINCIPLES EACH. EACH PRINCIPLE IS ACCOMPANIED BY A GUIDELINE AND I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION TWO OF THE WHAT I THINK ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES. THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN EACH OF THE OPTIONS AND POINT OUT THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY DIFFER. SO ONE IS NON DISCRIMINATION BOTH OPTION ONE AND OPTION TO STATE THE PRINCIPLE OF NON DISCRIMINATION- BOTH GUIDELINES WOULD REQUIRE AFFILIATES TO HAVE AN EXPRESS INSTITUTIONAL POLICY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION. ON ALL GROUNDS ADDRESS BY STATE LAW AND YOU SEE VALUES. HOWEVER OPTION TO AN OPTION TO WAS THE ONE THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDE AFFILIATIONS BETWEEN YOU SEE IN THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS OR OTHER. RELIGIOUS HOSPITALS THAT HAVE RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON HEALTH CARE OPTION TWO IS GUIDELINE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS. STATE THAT YOU SEE CONSIDERS POLICIES THAT PROHIBIT GENDER AFFIRMING SERVICES. FOR DURANT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ABORTION AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. THE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT WOMEN IN LGBT PEOPLE TO VIOLATE YOU SEE ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICY. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE I'M GONNA MENTION A GUIDELINE THAT I'M GONNA MENTION ADDRESSES EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE. SO BOTH OPTIONS A FIRM THE GOAL OF REDUCING BARRIERS TO ACCESS- TWO CARAT YOU SEE HEALTH. OPTION ONES GUIDELINES STATES YOU SEE WILL EVALUATE POTENTIAL AFFILIATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF UC'S COMMITMENT TO OPTIMIZE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE NON DISCRIMINATORY EVIDENCE BASED HEALTH CARE OPTIONS. TO IMPROVE HEALTH FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU SEE HEALTH WILL CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS OF AN ORCHID ORGANIZATIONS CARE IN AN AFFILIATION INCLUDING ONE POLICY BASE RESTRICTIONS TO. SERVICE TO THE UNDERSERVED AND THREE THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER FACILITIES WITHIN A GEOGRAPHIC REGION. ADVOCATES FOR THE AFFILIATIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON SERVICES TO THE UNDERSERVED AND YET AS LAURA FRIEDMAN MENTION NATIONAL DATA SHOW THAT WHILE CATHOLIC SERVICES ARE MEDICAID HOSPITALS. THEY DO NOT PROVIDE- HIGHER LEVELS OF CHARITY CARE THAN PUBLIC HOSPITALS IN EVEN SOME FOR PROFIT SYSTEMS. OPTION TWO SKYLINE ON EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE STATES THAT YOU SEE. WILL EVALUATE POTENTIAL pAFFILIATIONS AND TAKE NECESSARY ACTION TO PROMOTE AND NOT PROHIBIT OR LIMIT HEALTH CARE OPTIONS. TO ENSURE THE ACCESS TO SERVICES INCLUDING ABORTION CONTRACEPTION ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND GENDER FROM CARE FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE ARE MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF THE AFFILIATION. YOU SEE WILL ENSURE THAT AFFILIATIONS DO NOT RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE ABILITY OF YOU SEE PATIENTS TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES AND FACILITIES WHERE THEY RECEIVE CARE COMPARED WITH ACCESS TO THE SERVICES PRIOR TO THE AFFILIATION. SO THE OPTION TO GUIDELINES ARE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ISSUE. AND THEY PROVIDE A STANDARD AGAINST WHICH TO MEASURE IMPACT OF AFFILIATIONS. AND THEY MANDATE ACTION AS OPPOSED TO OPTION ONES REQUIREMENT THE FACTOR SIMPLY BEACON CENTERED. SO I WANT TO SPEND JUST A MINUTE OR TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO QUALITY OF CARE BY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SAID THOSE WHO ARE ADVOCATING FOR AFFILIATIONS WITH HOSPITALS THAT USE THE ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS DIRECTIVES ON HEALTH CARE. HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE GOAL OF EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND THEY POSIT THE CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AS- THE POSITION A CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AS VEHICLES TO EXPAND UC'S ABILITIES. TO PROVIDE CARE TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AS AN ASIDE IT'S A LITTLE IRONIC BECAUSE SOME OF THE UC MEDICAL CENTERS INCLUDING UC DAVIS MY HOME SCHOOL. HAVE HAD AN ON AND OFF RELATIONSHIP MEDI CAL- THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN ACCEPTED MEDICAID PATIENTS. CATHOLIC HOSPITALS AS I MENTIONED ARE MEDI CAL OR MEDICAID HOSPITALS THEY DO PROVIDE CARE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. ENROLLED IN MEDICAID- JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DATA AMONG NON ELDERLY MEDI CAL ENROLLEES IN CALIFORNIA. 7% OR BLACK AN AFRICAN AMERICAN 60% ARE LEFT IN ACCESS. AND 10% ARE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER. MANY MEMBERS OF THESE COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER THE BARRIERS THEY FACE TO NON DISCRIMINATORY FULL SERVICE CARE OFTEN GREATER. CALIFORNIA- IDENTIFIED AS WOMEN AND MANY WOMEN AND ROLLING MEDI CAL WHEN THEY BECOME PREGNANT. EITHER BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING PRENATAL SERVICES AND SOMEONE ROLE BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEKING ACCESS TO ABORTION. NATIONALLY PATIENTS WHEN MEDICAID COVERAGE ARE LARGELY IN DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN. PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR- PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN MENTION THE STUDY A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY COMPARING FAITH. EXAMINE THIRD FOUR STATES AND FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN STATES WOMEN OF COLOR MORE LIKELY THAN WHITE WOMEN TO GIVE BIRTH AT HOSPITALS. BOUND BY THE E. R. D.'S. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT HOSPITAL'S BOUND BY THE E. R. T.'S MIGHT BE PROVIDING CARE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. BUT IN DOING SO THEY PUT HE MAJORITY OF THOSE PATIENTS AT RISK OF LESS THAN STANDARD CARE AND EXCLUSION FROM NECESSARY SERVICES. SO THE LOGIC OF THOSE WHO ARE SUPPORTING AFFILIATIONS ONLY WORKS IF YOU IF YOU SACRIFICE THE HEALTH NEEDS. OF WOMEN AND LGBT Q. PATIENTS. SELLING CLOSING I JUST WANT TO QUOTE A BRIEF STATEMENT THAT'S IN THE REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE NON DISCRIMINATION AND-HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE. QUOTE IT IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE UNIVERSITY'S VALUES. TO ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITY THAT WILL LIFT SOME BUT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHERS. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT INSIGHT I ONE OF THINK SOME LIMóN LOW MOAN RECOGNIZE HER FOR JOINING US. WE DO HAVE QUITE THE PANEL OF ADVOCATES ON THIS ISSUE HERE TODAY WITH US AT THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND MISS THEM OUT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR REMARKS I TURNED OVER TO YOU THANK YOU. WELL I WON IT IT KNOWLEDGE AND THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE- IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE ARE ALSO PART OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- AND SO AT NOT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE DID HAVE A INCREDIBLE ALLIES THAT WERE HERE EARLIER AND- ARE EQUALLY AS ENGAGE- BUT I APPRECIATE. THE RECOMMENDATION OF AS ADVOCATES WILL YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE ASK WHAT ARE WE LEFT TO DO I THINK- ALL THREE OF US IS I RECOGNIZE HAVE SIGNED ON TO LETTERS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW PUBLICLY IT. WHERE OF THE- PLANTATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEN THESE WORKAROUNDS THAT WERE SEEN. THAT LIMIT CHOICE. I'M IN A VERY TRUE WAY- AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US THAT WE CAN EITHER. THINK ABOUT DOING OURSELVES OR THAT WE CAN TAKE BACK TO A CAUCUS THAT HAS BEEN. ON THE FOREFRONT OF ST- KENO HEALTH CARE. ALTOGETHER COMPLETELY. COMPREHENSIVE IS WHAT WE WORK FOR NOT. PARTIAL IT OUT YOU KNOW. WHAT IS LOOK LIKE HOW CAN WE BE HOW. ON AS LIKE JUST. A THINK EVERY YEAR I MEAN. I KNOW A SUMMER KAMLAGER IS RUNNING A BILL IN THIS MOMENT ON THIS VERY ISSUE ABOUT COVERAGE IN INCREASING. SO WE'RE ALL TRYING IN EVERY WAY WE CAN BUT WHAT ELSE. CAN WE SPECIFICALLY DO YOU- RIGHT NOW THIS YEAR- WHAT CAN WE TAKE BACK TO A CAUCUS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO AGAIN I'M PHILLIP BURLINGAME WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA I'M- YOU KNOW IT IT'S- THIS IS SUCH A TRICKY ISSUE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND AS WE'VE ALL DESCRIBED THIS IS SUCH A MONUMENTAL PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. AND YET THE STAKES ARE ALSO VERY HIGH- IN TERMS OF MAKING- ON SORT OF A MISSTEP WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WE HEARD THE FIRST PANEL TALKING ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH- ON THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COURTS ARE SORT OF X. INTERPRETING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM- YOU KNOW VERY BROADLY MUCH MORE BROADLY THAN. THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE- IN IN CALIFORNIA AND SO ON. I KNOW I DO THINK THAT AS EVAN- OF AND- LISA WERE SAYING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT IN THIS MOMENT IS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REMAINS A STRONG. SORT OF BULWARK AGAINST THE ENCROACHMENT OF- RELIGION PARTICULARLY AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY DO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT ON THAT LEGISLATORS CAN- CAN DO IS PARTICIPATE AS- AS THOUGHT LEADERS AS- VûI AS LEADERS OF THE- YOU KNOW MOVEMENT TO IN CALIFORNIA TO SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROBLEMATIC AND I. AND I KNOW YOU BUT I JUST THINK. YOU KNOW RE. IT'S REALLY IN. I WOULD THEY ALSO THAT. YOU KNOW FUNDED THERE'S REALLY ABOUT SHE'S A THIRTY. ARMED AND THE ROLE THAT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY IN REALLY DIGGING AND TO THE CONSOLIDATION AND EXPANSION OF- OF A THE SYSTEMS AND YOU KNOW HOLDING SETTING SOME CRITERIA FOR PARTNERSHIPS- THEIR- AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW IS LIMITED TO NONPROFIT HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS SO IF THERE IS A- AN INVOLVEMENT AT A MERGER LEVEL WITH A FOR PROFIT ENTITY OR A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT AG DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THAT SO I KNOW. THAT SOMETHING THAT CURRENTLY ARE BEING DESCRIBED AS WELL. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ON REGARDING HOW DELICATE THE SITUATION IS IN THAT. EVEN AN UNINTENDED MISHAP CAN HAVE A CONSEQUENCE THAT WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR- SO I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT. THANK YOU MISS LIMóN AND- AS ALWAYS THANKS FOR BEING OUR INCREDIBLE VICE CHAIR WHO LEADS THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN THIS FIGHT EVERY DAY. MISS COLLARED GIVE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS I SENT THE WRONG PART OF HERE BUT- I'M- SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU ALL FOR- SHARING YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR STORIES AND- TO EVAN AS YOU WERE TALKING YOU SAID- YOU KNOW THIS PART ISN'T SAD AND I WANT YOU TO ACTUALLY KNOW THAT NO PART OF WHAT YOU SAID WAS SAD. ALL PARTS OF WHAT YOU SAID WAS EMPOWERING ARM AND SO PLEASE TAKE THAT WITH YOU- I WATCHED YOU. SPEAK BEFORE CONGRESS AND YOU ARE OUR STATE CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE. SO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT MY FRIEND- MY TWO QUICK QUESTIONS ARE. IN THIS IS YOU'LL HAVE TO JUST BE VERY QUICK- BECAUSE IT'S A OF A LOT OF LARGE QUESTION BUT WHICH PRINCIPLE IS SUPER SETON. IS IT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE US CONSTITUTION OR THE E. R. D. OF THE CHURCH. BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDES THE UC SYSTEM BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES I WOULD ARGUE STATE FUNDING. YOU KNOW THROUGH MEDI CAL AND HOW WE DELIVER SERVICES. AND SO IN YOUR ESTIMATION WHICH IS I KNOW THIS IS A LEGAL QUESTION PROBABLY A CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION BUT WHICH ONE. IS SUPER SEASON LAWYER THE PANEL- COME WRESTLE YOU FOR. SO THE E. R. DID GET TO PREVAIL BECAUSE OF A FEDERAL STATUTE. OF THE FEDERAL STATE YOU CAN BE CHANGED AND SO I WOULD ENCURAGE YOU RIGHT AS AND EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM TO ADVOCATE. FOR MODIFYING THE SCOPE OF- THE WELTON ACTRESS KNOWS CODES ACT AND THE CHURCH ACT- THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS BALL ROLLING SUCH A LARGE EXTENT WE'VE GOT THESE FEDERAL STATUTES PROTECTING THE ABILITY NOT JUST OF INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS. RIGHT BUT OF NOW CONSOLIDATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS- TO WIELD THIS CLUB- THE POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IN RESPONSE TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOANS QUESTION WAS. WHAT LAW A LARGE PART OF WHAT TO STAKE IS THE STANDARD OF CARE. SO HUGE PERCENTAGE OF PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRAINED AT THE UC SYSTEM MMHM- AND SO THEIR TRAINING IS AFFECTED- BY THESE AFFILIATIONS THAN IT AFFECTS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST THOSE WHO RECEIVING CARE IN THE DIGNITY HOSPITALS. I MEAN CERTAINLY THE UC PROVIDERS SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE BEST EVIDENCE BASED CARE AVAILABLE. I JUST WANT TO JUMP IN IF I CAN FOR ONCE AGAIN ON YOUR QUESTION I'M- I THINK THAT IT'S- YOU KNOW AS I WAS TRYING TO KIND OF POINT OUT. THESE HOSPITALS EXIST THEY'RE SORT OF TRYING TO PLAY DUAL ROLE RIGHT WHEN THEY WANT TO BE A HOSPITAL THEY SAY OVER A HOSPITAL MORE PROVIDING- CHARITY CARE AND CARE TO MEDICAL PATIENTS AT CETERA- AND WHEN THEY WANNA. SORT OF SITE THEIR RELIGIOUS. RATIONALE FOR THE CARE THEY PROVIDE THEN THEY GOING TO THIS PLACE WHERE THEY SAY WELL WE'RE REALLY KIND OF LIKE A CHURCH- I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE- WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT. TO SAY OKAY IF YOUR HOSPITAL EXISTING IN THE SPACE THEN. YOU NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE LICENSING LAWS OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE ANTI DISCRIMINATION. LAWS AND SO SORT OF WITH IT. INSTEAD OF SORT OF STEPPING UP TO THESE LOOK BIG CONVERT BIG DISCUSSIONS ABOUT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND THAT CENTER RIGHT TO SAY OKAY AS A HOSPITAL EXISTING WITHIN THIS REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN CALIFORNIA WHAT ARE YOU DOING. AND NOT DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE ABIDING BY THESE RULES AND NOT DISCRIMINATING- I WOULD SAY ALSO THE MEDI CAL- QUESTION IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT'S A REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. OPPOSE LOOK AT THE STATE WAS DOING PROVIDING HUGE GRANTS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT. SCENARIOS THAN IF THE HOSPITAL'S ALREADY PROVIDED THE SERVICES JUST SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT- IT MAKES THE PUBLIC FUNDS. MEANT A LOT MORE COMPLICATED. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT THE QUESTION LEVERAGE FUND VAN ARE SORT OF VOTE THEE'S I'M NO WAY CLOT SO THAT YOU KNOW ARE THEY VIOLATING THAT HE'S I THINK IS A LITTLE MORE OF A COMPLICATED QUESTION IN MY SECOND QUICKER QUESTION AND GIVEN WHAT MISS LOAN MENTIONED AND YOUR RESPONSES IS NO I ACTUALLY- EIGHT MY BILL A- SEVENTY THREE WE GET WE CROSSED THE DESK OF TODD COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND IT'S A NO COST SHARING BILL. FOR REFER TO HELP LES. I'LL OF NO OF I'LL FROM THE TRI AND- SO WHATEVER. BUT I. WENT SO WHEN DO WE NOT FIGHT THEN BECAUSE. MY AS THE I'M LEARNING ABOUT ALL OF THE THINGS THE INSIDIOUS PERVASIVE NUANCED COMPLICATED THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING MAYBE AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND YOU WE DON'T WANT TO CHERRY PICK. YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE HAVING GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT. YOU JUST HAVE TO USE THE LEVERAGE OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LAW AND YOU FIND YOUR STANDING- BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT WE ARE BECOMING OVERWHELMED BY. THE LARGESS OF SORT OF BATTLES THAT WE SEE AND SO DO YOU LAY DOWN. OR DO YOU FIND THE SPACE TO FIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS ALSO MAYBE A LARGER QUESTION BUT YOU KNOW WHEN DO YOU NOT FOR THE IS THERE AN INSTANCE WHERE YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIGHT. BECAUSE EVAN STORY EVAN STORY CAN BE SHARED BY SO MANY FOLKS WHO ARE TRANSGENDER WHO ARE POOR WHO ARE BLACK WHO ARE BROWN WHO ARE WOMEN. I MEAN I THINK MY RESPONSE TO THAT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP ALL THE SPACE FOR RESPONSES BUT MY RESPONSE IS THAT I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS PANELIST IS FIGHTING I MEAN WE ALL BELIEVE IN AND FIGHTING- AND WE'RE ALL DOING IT IN WAYS THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW OUR INCREDIBLY MEANING WELL I MEAN EVAN PROVIDE A CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY AND THERE WAS THAT VIDEO OF I'M A SEE THAT HAS BEEN SEEN BY OVER MILLION PEOPLE NOW- WE'RE INVOLVED WITH THE- PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS SOLICIT MORE STORAGE IS LIKE THE STORY OF MICHELIN JOSH THAT WE EARLIER. I THINK THE RESEARCH THAT- LAURIE IS DOING AND THE- THE ENGAGEMENT OF- ACADEMICS WITHIN- THE UC SYSTEM IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE LITIGATION IS IMPORTANT SO ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER I THINK ARE REALLY- ON CREATING- A CULTURE OF INCREASING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS WHOLE REVIEW THING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE- SO I WOULDN'T AT ALL I WANT TO GIVE THE- RUSSIAN. AND BUSTER SAYING. OUT THIS. RIGHT SO LET'S. GO HOME I THINK IT THIS FIVE THAT MOM REQUIRE. I A VARIETY OF TACTICS AND- AND WORK OVER THE LONG OVER THE LONG TERM THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE. BUT CAN I JUST SAY THAT I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU- MENTIONED YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ME HAPPENS TO EITHER COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY FOLKS IN MY LIKE I'M VERY AWARE OF MY POSITION AS- A TRANS GENDER MALE. IN THE A OVERALL SPECTRUM OF THE TRANS COMMUNITY AND LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME I'M VERY PRIVILEGED IN MY OWN COMMUNITY AND SELL- YEAH LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IT HAPPENS TO BLACK AND BROWN TRANS FOLK DISPROPORTIONATELY WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU KNOW. WHO DON'T HAVE THE RECOURSE IS THAT I HAD YOU KNOW AND FOLKS WHO ARE I HAVE. THE NOT HAVE THAT THE CLASS THAT I'M PART OF AND STUFF LIKE THAT INTO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING THAT BECAUSE THAT IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. SO I MEAN THANK YOU FOR NOT LOSING THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD REPEATEDLY TODAY IS THAT THIS AFFILIATION IS TO SERVE THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND YET I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU ARE A MEMBER OF AN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY WHO IS. THE FURTHEST THING FROM SERVE HERE THAT IT'S A WEIRD POSITION TO BE IN YEAH AND AT AT PRIVILEGE PERSON AND UNDER VERY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY. YEAH I AM. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I AM AND I VERY MUCH SHARE YOUR PHILOSOPHY WHICH IS I MEAN WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT IS PART OF A FIGHT AND SHINING LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE IN HEARING THE STORIES. MAKING SURE THAT HAVE IT MINES IN THAT ROOM TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION EQUIP US AND OUR COLLEAGUES WITHOUT THAT. PRETTY FLANK AND WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THAT'S FOR. AB SO. WHICH CHEST PIECE MOVES ALWAYS THE- I'M SO IN A QUESTION AND- THE UC AFFILIATION AT SO. ONE OF THINGS WE HEAR IS YOU KNOW WELL YOU'RE HAAS YOU SEE HOSPITAL AND THEIR CAPACITY IN DOWN THE ROAD YOU HAVE A- AM CATHOLIC AT A HOSPITAL AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE ANTI BAD IF WE CAN MOVE THE PATIENTS WHO WON'T BE AFFECTED BY POLICIES. SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THAT'S- REAL OR NOT. AND THEN. YOU KNOW WE WOULD HAVE SPACES ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THE UC I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS COULD WE MOVE. TRANSFER THOSE PEOPLE WITHOUT AFFILIATION IS THAT A REAL ARGUMENTS I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING TO PERSPECTIVE. IT'S FOR. WITH A YOU. IS A FOLK. AND THERE'S A DIGNITY YEAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SAN FRANCISCO- VERSION OF THE SETS COULD WE MOVE THOSE PATIENTS TO THAT CTHOLIC HOSPITAL WITHOUT THE AFFILIATION OR THEY TRACKED AND YOU SEE HOSPITAL I GUESS I DON'T SEE THE AFFILIATION IS NECESSARY TO THE NEED THAT IS BEING EXPRESSED TO ME. AND I WONDER IF IT IS RARE. I MEAN. SO I WOULD REALLY THIS RATIONALES FOR THE- OKAY YEAH. I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE EACH CAMPUS HAS THEIR OWN CLINICAL. CAN OF SCENARIOS THAT COME UP AND THEY CAN BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT- BUT- I THINK YOU ASK A- GOOD QUESTION AND ONE OF THE THAT. THINGS THAT I KEEP WANTING. TO PUSH BACK IS WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS- AND SO THIS THIS. I THINK BEFORE WE- CONSIDER OPENING THE DOOR TO MORE- SORT OF CEMENTING PARTNERSHIPS AND SORT OF STRENGTHENING. THE CATHOLIC SYSTEMS AS WELL IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE AND WHAT THE REAL IMPACTS ARE SO. A LOT OF THIS IS BEEN. M. SERVE DISCUSSED IN THE ABSTRACT WITHOUT REALLY GOOD DATA ABOUT HOW MANY YOU SEE PEOPLE WOULD END UP IN A YEAR THE HOT. BUT ALL. I VICE VERSA. COURSE URGENCY WE YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN'T BRING PATIENTS BACK AND FORTH BUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO WAS. A SITUATION WHERE WE FIGURE LATELY I'VE MOST MY OF OUR PAY. AND DIGNITY HOME AND IN. CAN SERVE MORE PEOPLE AT HIGHER HIGHER LIKE SPECIALTY- NEEDS. SO I WOULD I WOULD URGE YOU AND ME MY ASK MY BATES BE TO REALLY QUESTION ON THE STORY ABOUT. WHO WILL BENEFIT- THROUGH AFFILIATION YEAH AND I MEAN AS YOU HEARD FROM PROFESSOR GOOD ONE OF HER VERY SHORT NO WE HAVE NOT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WORK WAS NOT DONE TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS US IS VERY- AND SO THIS DICHOTOMY THAT HAS BEEN SET UP BETWEEN THESE TWO. POSITIONS THERE'S A LOT IN THE MIDDLE THE NEEDS TO BE DONE I BELIEVE YEAH SOUNDS LIKE. THERE IS DEFINITELY. IS THAT. THEY'RE SHIFTING FOLKS WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO HEAR THE ORGAN WILD RIGHT KNEE REPLACEMENTS WITH EXAMPLE I HEARD SO SIMILAR BUT YES SO BUT THAT BEING SAID I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS IF WE HAVE THOSE KNEE REPLACEMENTS- CAN BE MOVED IN WE HAVE A UCSF SOMEONE WHO HAS SIGNIFICANT. HEART TRANSPLANT NEEDS THAT ONLY CAN BE THIRTY SAID CAN WE STILL TRANSFER THAT KNEE REPLACEMENT I GUESS I'M CONFUSED BY THE NEED FOR THE VIOLATION IN ORDER TO DO THAT. ALL ALL JUST- QUICKLY SAY BEFORE THE EXPERTS WAY AND- ON EITHER SIDE OF ME BECAUSE I JUST HAVE MY OWN STORY TO SHARE. BUT AND I GOT LOST IN THE DIGNITY HEALTH SYSTEM LIKE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET LOST REGARDLESS I WAS. ON THE BOOKS AND THE DIGNITY HEALTH SIT. IN AND- GENDER AND THEN THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK ME OFF THE BOOKS. AND SO REGARDLESS AB AND I REALLY LOOK FOR CAN'T WHAT THE EXPERTS ARE GONNA SAY. BACK AND REGARDLESS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM AND MISTAKES ARE GOING TO BE. EIGHT AND ALL THREE OF. US OF THE FACT THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S A COMMUNITY. THAT NUMBER JUMPS KNOW. DUE TO ANTI TRANS BIAS. SO I DON'T WANT ANY MISTAKES TO BE MADE. AS IT IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. ONE LORRIES MADE THIS POINT REALLY EFFECTIVELY BEFORE IS THAT NOT EVERYBODY WHO HAS A HEART CONDITION RIGHT IS A MAN. RIGHT THEY MIGHT BE SOMEBODY FINDS OUT THEY'RE PREGNANT- AND THEY NEED CARE BECAUSE OF THAT. SO THERE'S THAT CONCERN AS WELL BUT THE OTHER IS YOU KNOW THE STORY THE EVAN MEN RAISES THE DIGNITARY CONCERNS SO YEAH YOU COULD TRANSFER SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SOME OTHER SORT OF CARE THAT'S PROHIBITED BY THE E. R. DIS. TO RIGHT FROM THE FROM THE CATHOLIC LITTLE TO THE UC HOSPITAL SO THEY CAN RECEIVE THAT BUT THE TRANSFER ITSELF WAS SIGNATORY HARM. THE FACT THAT IT'S SYSTEMATIC THE IMPACTS ONLY CERTAIN POPULATIONS IN THAT THAT'S PREDICTABLE. IS PART OF WHOLE THAT SIX PLACE AT WHY WE KEEP USING THE WORD DISCRIMINATION RIGHT AND THAT'S WHY IT VIOLATES BOTH THE VALUES OF YOU SEE. ON THE STATE OF VALUES OF YOU SEE AND THE VALUES OF THE STATE SO YES IT'S TRUE YOU CAN GO TO. I LIVE IN DAVIS RIGHT THE HOSPITAL IN DAVIS IT'S NOT A CATHOLIC HOSPITAL AND MIGHT BE THAT THEY TRANSFER YOU BECAUSE IT'S NOT A HUGE HOSPITAL. SO THEY TRANSFER THE TRAUMA PATIENTS SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE BUT THAT DOESN'T THAT HITS PATIENTS RANDOMLY RIGHT IT DOESN'T HIT THAT DIRECTLY BASED ON THEIR IDENTITY. IS RULES DIGITAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT IT'S A MATTER OF LIKE CAN DOWN IN THAT THE- NINERS SANTA. AND I WAS. I SHOWED UP IN A HOSPITAL AN APPENDECTOMY WITH AN APPENDICITIS I WOULD BEEN ONE OF THOSE ROUTINE CASES TURNED OUT I WAS PREGNANT. AND MY REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS BECAME CENTRAL TO MEDICARE SO TO YOUR POINT. IS NOT ALWAYS PEOPLE SEEKING RETRACTED HAIR BE THAT KIND OF GUIDANCE AS I DID THROUGH MY TREATMENT. I'M SO I AM I AND THIS GOES TO SOMETHING THAT EVAN HAS SPOKEN ABOUT IN GREAT DEPTH WHICH IS GETTING ENDING UP RECAP ACOSTA- AND NOT EVEN KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS CASOS WILL YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT A LOT PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT WHY PATIENTS ARE ENDING UP AT THESE HOSPITALS AND DON'T KNOW. AND THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT SINCE THEY GO WITH IT. I CAN SEE MY IN REAL QUICK AND IT WAS COVERED BY MY INSURANCE AND THAT'S WHERE AND IT WAS CLOSEST IN THOSE CLOSEST HOSPITAL TO ME. AND THAT'S WHERE MY DOCTOR ALWAYS PERFORMS HER HYSTERECTOMIES. AND SO SHE JUST GOT WILL THAT THERE BECAUSE OF A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR WAS ALSO AN OBGYN. AND THERE'S NO DISCLOSURE OF ANY. YEAH OUT THERE- THERE ISN'T ANY KIND OF. YOU KNOW I THINK LEGALLY AND FORCED AGAIN PROTOCOL THAT'S- UNIFORM THAT PATIENTS WOULD KNOW TO LOOK FOR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S SOMETHING IN WASHINGTON STATE WHERE THEY'VE- ENDED A- AS- LAW TO- TO. DEMAND DISCLOSURE. BUT HIDDEN IN A WEBSITE AND SO ANYWAY ONE OF THE MAIN ANSWERS. AS THEY'RE JUST IN A LIBRARY AT TO TAKE THE RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS OUT OF THE BRANDING AND A LOT OF HOSPITALS AND IF YOU'LL REMEMBER WHEN DIGNITY WAS CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE WEST AND BOTH MEN AND IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING DIGNITY DOESN'T SOUND PARTICULARLY- RELIGIOUS TO MOST PEOPLE AND I'M YOU KNOW A CATHOLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES WILL BECOME COMMON SPEAK IT IN A CITY NAMES OR NAMES OF MOST HOSPITALS HAVE KIND OF TAKEN THAT THE SAINTS OUT OR THE- AS- REALLY. THREE BUT OF INTERVIEWS. THEIR WOMEN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY MANY OF THEM- CHRIS CHEN RELATIVELY RELIGIOUS AND THEY DON'T ANTICIPATE- MOST OF THESE RESTRICTIONS AND THEY OFTEN SAY- I JUST THOUGHT THE LAW WITH THE LAW LIKE IF YOU'RE A HOSPITAL YOU HAVE TO OFFER THE LEGAL STUFF THAT'S A VERY COMMON PERSPECTIVE THEY DON'T EXPECT THEIR PHYSICIANS TO SAY SORRY I'M BOUND BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH ONE THING I DO WANT TO ADD IS THAT. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT. INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO- PROVIDE NOTICE WHEN THEY HAVE HOSPITALS IN THE NETWORK THAT ARE- RESTRICTING CARE IT'S SOMETHING THAT FEW INSURANCE- PLANS ACTUALLY DO IN A WAY THAT'S TRANSPARENT AND VISIBLE FOR ENROLLEES AND NOT COULD.IS SOMETHING THAT- ADVOCATES IN THE STATES HAVE TALKED ABOUT- AWAY TO KIND OF UP THAT- KIND OF PRESSURE ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SO THAT FOLKS IN THE SITUATION THAT EVANS AND WHERE IT'S LIKE MY INSURANCE IS SENT ME TO THIS HOSPITAL. ON AT LEAST THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF- WELL WHAT ARE THE HOSPITAL'S WITHIN YOUR NETWORK AND WHAT SORT OF SERVICES TODAY PROVIDE AND THAT'S AN OBLIGATION ON THE INSURANCE PLAN ON ON POSSIBLE IT'S- INTERESTING. AND THEN WE'RE SEE YOU SPOKE ALSO PRESERVATION ABOUT- CAB ACOSTA- SENDING PATIENTS ELSEWHERE FOR CARE WHERE DID THEY SEND THEM IF THEY DO SEND THEM YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY VERY ABLE AND PEOPLE HAVE THEIR- YOU KNOW EACH HAVE THEIR TRANSFER RELATIONSHIPS AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOU KNOW THE HIGHER LEVEL KERR NEAR THEM- BUT ONE OF THAT REALLY COMMON THEMES IN MY DATA WERE. I'M DOCTORS WHO WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE POST PARTUM CONTRACEPTION STERILISATION THEY- OR EVEN CLINIC CONTRACEPTION THEY SAY. WELL ACTUALLY IT'S KIND OF IT'S FINE BECAUSE WE CAN SEND THEM TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD I JUST TELL THEM TO GO TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD. SO INTERESTING I'M- AG CONNECTION CONSIDERING THE FUNDING CHALLENGES PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S HAVING- THAT THEY'RE ALSO CARRYING THE WATER FOR THESE DENIALS AND- SO WE CAN SEE SERVE THE EGO SYSTEM I REAP. HEALTH CARE AND PLACE THIS. A LOT AT THE DESIGN I'M IN A APOLOGY IF I MISS IT BUT IS. IS WHEN THEY CANNOT PERFORM THE MEDICAL NEED IS IT A 100% OF THE TIME THAT THEY- REFER OR IS THERE A PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME LIKE DO WE KNOW. OKAY SO IT WE DO NOT HAVE STATISTICS ABOUT THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I DO A LOT OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH AND GET A SENSE OF. THE FACT THAT. HOSPITAL'S VERY AND HOW THEY HELP PERMISSIBLE THEY ARE TO SORT OF WORK AROUNDS OR OR THE LIKE I SAID ABOUT- SORT OF MAKING UP A NON CONTRACEPTIVE REASON FOR SOMETHING OR FOR THAT KIND OF THING SO. SINCE SOME PLACES HAVE A BY. SOME CIVIC. ON CONTRACEPTIVE REASON FOR SOMETHING AND OTHER DR OTHER PLACES AND OTHER DOCTORS WOULD TELL ME THAT IT HAS BECOME VERY STRICT ACTUALLY STRANGELY QUITE MORE STRICKEN IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS BECAUSE- THERE WAS A BIG MOVEMENT WITHIN THAT BISHOP AMONG THE BISHOPS- TO. CLAMP DOWN ON TOO MANY EXCEPTIONS TO THEIR STERILIZATION POLICY THEY WERE BEING DONE TO WIDELY AND SO. A LOT OF LOT OF THE DOCTORS I SPOKE WITH SAID YOU KNOW WHEN I TOOK THIS JOB PEOPLE SAID IT WAS NO BIG DEAL WE JUST HAD TO DO A FORM THEY RUBBER STAMP IN THE WE COULD DO THE STERILIZATION BUT AT. A TO STOP BEING A ALLOWED SO IT'S UNFORTUNATELY NOT HARD DATA ON THAT BUT QUITE A LOT OF VERY ABILITY AND- AM. AND WHAT I ALSO SENSED FROM THE DOCTORS WAS JUST THAT YOU KNOW SOME WERE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDING VERY GOOD HERE AND THEY WOULD MAYBE TRY TO. COME NEW IN A SAYS. AS AS THE CUT. IN A PREGNANCY. ARM AND THEN THERE SOME PEOPLE. WHO JUST SORT OF LOOK AT. OTHERS IT JUST. WELL THANK YOU ALL CLOSE WITH THE LAST QUESTION THAT AND UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING. THAT I CLOSE WITHIN THE LAST PANEL IF YOU HAVE ANY LAST ASKS FOR US. YOU KNOW MISLIM OWN ASKED WHAT WE COULD DO BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE QUESTION OF. HOW CAN WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT- HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THESE VULNERABLE AND I WOULD CALL UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS- AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LEAVE US. I INVITE YOU TO SELL. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT. PLUS ONE ON THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU I WE WILL OPEN IT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYBODY HAS A PUBLIC COMMENT YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME UP THE MAKE IS OPEN.
