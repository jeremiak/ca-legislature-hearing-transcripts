AND BOTH OF OUR SHOULD BE TO YOUR BILLI WANT TO WORK TOGETHER IN HARMONY. BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FROM POINT FOR THAT REASON OKAY WE APPRECIATE THAT ROCK CRIME. WE'VE ALWAYS YOU DO AS A TEAM PLAYER. I'M NOT MUCH INTO SPORTS FAN BUT WHATEVER THE TEAM IS I'M IN. SO -- YOUR TO PRESENT ON THIS -- FILE ITEM SIX SB. FIVE TWENTY AND I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ON THE ENEMY JUST FRAME IT A LITTLE BIT THIS WAY JUST FOR A MOMENT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER SEASON SHOWS LIKE THE HISTORY SHE LIKES HISTORY LESSONS BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN IN THE SITUATION NOW FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WHERE. WE'RE TRYING. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRUCTURE OUR ELECTRICITY UTILITIES WE CERTAINLY HAVE FACED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH THE BILL AND YOU AND OTHERS HAVE. A IS WE'RE CONSIDERING IN THE ASSEMBLY WAS CONSIDERED THE SENATE. BECAUSE OF THE ABNORMAL SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA THE THE NEW ABNORMAL. BUT ALSO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ON THE ONE HAND MOVE AWAY FROM THE OLD MODEL. RIGHT. AND AND THEN COME UP WITH A NEW MODEL THAT SUPPORTS OUR CORE VALUES THAT DEALS WITH THE GREEN ENERGY ISSUES AND PLAY THAT WORKS. AS A SERIES OF THREE STEPS TO DO THAT. WE'VE BEEN ADDRESSING ALL OF THEM LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE WE DROPPED WE ADDRESS ARE A RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WHEN WE DO THESE PLANS WE HAVE ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY WORK FOR THE LONG TERM. SECOND THE BILL THAT I JUST PUSHED OFFER TO YOUR BILL IS CENTER BUT CAN PROCUREMENT THAT THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY. YOU'VE GOT A AS IT IS AT AS THE LARGE ARCHITECTURE HAVE A CENTRAL PROVIDER TODAY THE THIRD ELEMENT OF THAT IS THE PROPER THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. THE TERM IN THE IN AMONG GOVERNMENT US TYPES IS POLAR. WHAT WE'RE TRICKING TO DO IS TO CONGESTION TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS ELECTRICAL SERVICE IN CASE A RETAIL PROVIDER LEAVES THE MARKET FOR ANY REASON? WE SAW THAT IN THE ENERGY CRISIS TWENTY YEARS AGO. THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO THIS THIS IS A WAY TO BALANCE RETAIL CHOICE ON THE ONE HAND THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DEALT WITH SO MUCH ON THE ONE HAND. HOWEVER NOT ALLOWING ALSO TO LOAD SERVICE ENTITIES REGULATED FROM LEAVING SOME CUSTOMERS WITHOUT -- KEY CONSUMER AND PRICE PROTECTIONS MORE TO TALK ABOUT BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND I DIDN'T HEAR SECONDS. I HEARD A SECONDS. I DID I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION. APOLOGIES I'LL TURN THIS OVER TO ARGUE AGO -- LET'S GO SHOULD GO TO SCOTT [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU TO CHAIR MEMBERS MARK JOSEPH ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION CALIFORNIA AGILITY IS EMPLOYEES I'LL BE BRIEF. MOST OF LAST CENTURY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WAS THE ONLY PROVIDER AND THE QUESTION A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WAS NOT A QUESTION ANYBODY ASKED. AND SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE ESTABLISHING A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. WITH DEREGULATION WE HAVE NEW RETAIL PROVIDERS. AND THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK THAT NEW RETAIL PROVIDER. WE'LL GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR DROPS CUSTOMERS IN THE ENERGY CRISIS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS DROPPED AND RETURN TO THE UTILITY. SO WE NEED A SAFETY NET. THE THE AFTER ALL AFTER ALMOST TWENTY YEARS OF CALM IN THE MARKET SINCE THE ENERGY CRISIS. WE NOW HAVE -- A SITUATION WHERE DIRECT ACCESS IS EXPANDING. CCA'S ARE EXPANDING AND BY MOST PROJECTIONS -- WITH IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE MORE THAN 80% OF OUR CUSTOMERS WILL BE SERVED BY SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS ASK FOR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION AND DIRECTION. TO ESTABLISH A PRIDE OF LAST RESORT. SB FIVE TWENTY DOES EXACTLY THAT. WE CAN'T KEEP GOING WITH NOTHING IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CO TO ESTABLISH THE SAFETY NET AND STILL IS THE PROTOCOL FOR HOW THAT SAFETY THAT WILL BE OPERATED -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL AND IT FEELS A LONG STANDING GAP IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHAT YOU'RE BEHALF THE CALPERS DISSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A CALIFORNIA DESPITE COUNCILMAN LESTER SEATS COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS. VERY BRIEFLY WE GET SO CAUGHT UP IN ALL THE NEW WHIZ BAND GIDGET TECHNOLOGIES AND THINGS THAT WE FOCUS ON IN THESE COMMITTEES. THE SOMETIMES WE LOSE TRACK THE SORT OF BASIC ELEMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE P. YOU SEE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF AND THAT THERE IS A SAFETY NET FOR THEM. AND THIS SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF A LONG TIME AGO IT HASN'T BEEN IT NEEDS TO BE AND WE PERSON I'VE A THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHERS HERE WOULD LIKE TO LEND THEIR SUPPORT TO TO THIS BILL [inaudible] COME. FOR CHEN NUMBERS REBEKAH LEE ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD HELP ENSURE CONTINUED UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS MEASURES THAT THIS. BODY HAS PASSED REGARDLESS OF CHANGES THAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE RETAIL MARKET HERE TO URGENT I VOTE. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTES ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. I THANK YOU ONE HUNDRED STERN AYE B. W. LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE IN STRONG SUPPORT. WHICH CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOK RAISING OF THE CALIFORNIA POWER IT'S HE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR FOR TODAY'S AMENDMENTS THANK YOU -- JAMES ISSUE WITH THAT I WORK FOR BEGINNING -- WE'RE SUPPORTING THE BILL. JENNIFER THRELFALL I BEAT. VIEW TWELVE FORTY FIVE I SUPPORT. FONG TRYING TO BE A TWELVE FORTY FIVE FIRST ONE PIECE ANY SUPPORT. EILEEN SAKI IBEW TOP FORTY FIVE IN SUPPORT. JOSH RITTER THE IBEW TWELVE FORTY FIVE FULLY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE HERE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON -- MELISSA BROWN WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY AND ON BEHALF OF KELSEY CA -- WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE TODAY. ONE OF THEM IS THAT. UNDER THE CONSTRUCT COPPERY UP PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL FEES THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR COMPARED TO WHAT THEY PAY TODAY. SO TODAY WE AS LOW SERVING ENTITIES -- WE POST A BOND AND THAT. HELPS PROTECT CUSTOMERS IF THERE IS AN INVOLUNTARY RETURN TO I OWE YOU SERVICE BUT UNDER THIS BILL -- THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL FEES THAT WOULD BE LEVIED ON OUR CUSTOMERS ON ALL CUSTOMERS PRESUMABLY TO PAY FOR THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE FEES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN CUSTOMER RATES. ARE ALREADY RISING BECAUSE OF THE BURDENS OF WILDFIRE -- SECONDLY WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE UNDER UNDER THE THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN. IT HOT TIES THE HANDS OF THE CPC SO IT EVEN IF ANOTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITY WAS BETTER POSITION TO PROVIDE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT FUNCTION. THE CPUC CANNOT SELECT THAT ENTITY AS LONG AS UTILITY DOESN'T AGREE. SO IT IT GIVES THE UTILITY THE ABILITY TO PREVENT ANOTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITY FROM SITTING INTO THAT ROLE -- AND THEN FINALLY WERE CONCERNED BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE BILL'S WRITTEN THE UTILITY IS NOT -- ASKED TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MEET THE CRITERIA THAT IS ASPEN ANY OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITY THAT MIGHT WANT TO STEP FORWARD TO FILL THE ROLE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT -- FUNCTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO BE HOPPING WE THINK THAT MORE DIALOGUE IS NEEDED ON THIS TOPIC THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOPIC AND IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO NECESSARILY ENTRENCH ONE ENTITY AND NOT ROLE WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHAT ALL OPTIONS MIGHT BE ON THE TABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THIS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND EFFICIENT MANNER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK OR TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN OPPOSITION. OKAY -- IN OPPOSITION IN BETWEEN IN SUPPORT I MISS THE SUPPORT PART WE JUST MATT FRIEDMAN WITH UTILITY REFORM NETWORK WANT OFFER SUPPORT FOR THE BILL APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US WE GOT A FEW SMALL ISSUES. THAT -- WE STILL WANT TO WORK OUT BUT WE THINK THIS BILL IS DEFINITELY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION PROVIDES THE RIGHT SAFEGUARDS THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN OPPOSITION CAROL WE THE SUSTAINABLE ROSS MORE PROUD -- RECIPIENT OF MC CLEAN ENERGY. IN OPPOSITION KAREN PERKINS A MEMBER OF THREE FIFTY BAY AREA. AND ALSO -- CONSUMER OF COMMUNITY CHOICE -- AGGREGATION AGGREGATION. AND I BELIEVE IF THIS BILL ENCROACHES. ON THE CCA'S -- ABILITIES. TO PROCURE AN ENGINE LABEL C. P. U. S. ON THE UTILITY COMMISSION TO HAVE. MORE POWER THAN IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION? IT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE A DOCTOR QUIRK -- IF IF THE EDISON REPRESENTATIVE MISS LEE COULD COME UP I'D LIKE TO ASK HER SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL -- SO WE'LL START WITH MISTER GRANT FROM COULD -- EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY SO YOUR FIRST CONCERN IS THE FEE. YOU'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT YOU YOU SAY THAT. THE CURRENT I OWE YOU IN THE AREA WOULD BE THE THE STATEMENT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS THE I OWE YOU. DOESN'T HAVE TO GET PERMISSION. THAT THIS IS A CPU TO SEE USE. C. P. YOU SEE. OUR DECISION AS TO WHO WOULD BE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT IN THE BILL. MAKES YOU THINK THAT -- THE THE I. O. YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE A. B. THE FIRST ONE AND WOULD HAVE TO GET PERMISSION FOR SOMEONE ELSE AND THE P. YOU SEE COULD MAKE THAT DECISION WHAT IN THE BILL SAYS THAT. SO I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A LANGUAGE ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION BY DEFAULT BEING THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. AND IF ANOTHER ENTITY WANTS TO STEP UP AND BE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THEY WOULD NEED TO FILE A JOINT APPLICATION WITH THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION. WHERE IS THAT IN THE BILL AND NOW I CAN SHARE IT WITH YOU? OKAY THE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SHALL BE THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATION PAGE. FIVE THE SEX SUBSECTION BE -- LINE TWENTY SEVEN AND TWENTY EIGHT THAT IS THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BILL OKAY. SO [inaudible] IF [inaudible] IF IT -- COMMUNITY TRIES AGGREGATOR WANTS TO BE THE PROVIDERTHEY'D HAVE TO GET PERMISSION FROM THE I OR YOU OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- THEN YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE FEE. ARM AND THAT THAT'S WHERE I WANT TO GO TO EVER SAID. SO YOU'RE SUPPORTING THIS MY CONCERN. AND IS THAT. EVENT WELL FOR EXAMPLE WITH SEMPRA. THEY MAY END UP NOT BEING AN ENERGY SUPPLIER AT ALL. THEY WANT TO BECOME A WIRES COMPANY RIGHT I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE POSITION THAT EDITION HAS. BUT AT LEAST HALF YOUR LOAD IS PROBABLY GOING TO SEE CA PERHAPS MORE TO CCA'S. PERHAPS MORE. HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO BE A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WHEN YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE GENERATION CAPABILITY? I THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLYMEMBER. CURRENTLY SENDING CALIFORNIA EDISON DOES SERVE AS THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. FOR OUR SERVICE AREA AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT WE ARE LOSING SIGNIFICAN LOW TO COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATOR BUT IN RECENT -- YEAR IN THE PRISON MONTH WE ALSO SEE THE RETURN OF THESE CUSTOMERS DUE TO CERTAIN RATE. INCREASES IN BEING EXPERIENCE IN. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO IT IS NOT CERTAIN RIGHT NOW SO THERE'S SOME LOW MIGRATION THAT'S IN FLUX CURRENTLY AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO SET BACK FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK. TO ALLOW FOR CERTAINTY IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. OKAY BUT IN THE END SINCE YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE LONG TERM CONTRACTS TO SERVE THESE FOLKS. BOB YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET IS THAT. AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT ARE. THERE IS A PROVISION WITHIN THIS -- THIS MEASURED THOU WOULD. PROVIDE SOME ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO SET RULES TO ADDRESS MY LOW MIGRATION MATTERS SO IN CASE THERE IS A LARGE ON PLANNED MIGRATION THERE'S ABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO DO SOME OF UP FRONT WORK TO MEDICATE A THE NEEDS FOR THE PROVIDERS TO PROCURE A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUT OF MARKET OR LAST MINUTE PROCUREMENT THAT COULD BE MORE ON THIRTY THAN WHAT WE COULD DO UNDER LONG TERM CONTRACT SHOULD BE MORE DIRTY BUT IT COULD. ALSO BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND YOUR CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE WOULD NOT SUPPORT THAT SO I I JUST SEE SOME DIFFICULTY YOU ACTUALLY DOING IT IF YOU'RE PAYING. DOLLARS -- FOR MONEY ON HER. ATTENTION LEE THE SPOT MARKET COULD BE QUITE HIGH YOU COULD BE ENDING A PAIN SEVERAL TIMES MORE THAN YOUR RATE JUSTIFIES. HOW WOULD THE CPUC HANDLE THAT SO THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT? THESE ARE ALL. YES I THINK SO OKAY. BUT THIS IS REALLY BEEN THIS IS BEEN TWENTY YEARS OF THINKING. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS AS PEOPLE LEAVE WE HAVE A A REGULATE STRUCTURE AND SO THE CHALLENGE IT'S BEEN TO LITIGATION AND ALL THESE HEARINGS AT THE P. YOU SEE HAS BEEN. WHAT DO YOU DO TO THE PEOPLE THAT LIKE YOU WANNA PUT SOLAR ON YOUR ROOF? RIGHT AND THERE'S ALL THESE SOCIALIZE COST EVERYBODY RIGHT WHY IS IT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO LEAVE WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE PROCUREMENT COST IN DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS OF THAT THE BASICALLY THERE'S A CHARGE. TO CUSTOMERS TO LEAVE THAT THEY GOT TO PAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND ART HURT. AND THERE'S ALSO A BIG CHARGE OF THE WAY THE STRUCTURE WORKS THAT IF THEY WANT TO COME BACK ON THEY PAY MORE MONEY. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO GET FLEXIBILITY IN THE MARKET TO LET PEOPLE LEAVE AND DO ALL THE THINGS THEY WANT TO DO. BUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS LARGE ISSUE IN THIS IN DIFFERENT SOME OUT SO GOING TO YOUR POINT WHICH IS IN FACT THE WHAT HAPPENED THE ENERGY CRISIS NINETEEN YEARS AGO RIGHT. IS THIS ISSUE OF WHEAT WHEAT WHICH SAYING TO OURSELVES OKAY. EVERYBODY'S LEAVING WHAT DO WE DO WE AND THE REASON WE LANDED ON ON THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IS BECAUSE THEY ARE REGULATED. THEY'RE COMPLETELY REGULATED AND THERE'S A DETERMINES THE WHOLE PROCESS BEEN LITIGATED FOR TWENTY YEARS. THAT THERE ARE FINANCIALLY SECURE THEY HAVE A BALANCE SHEET THEY HAVE A SYSTEM THEY HAVE THE THE THE THE INDIFFERENCE AMOUNT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COVERED IF PEOPLE LEAVE SO WE DON'T HAVE THIS BIG LOAD ON PEOPLE. COMING FORWARD AND SO WHAT WE TRIED TO DO TO QUITE FRANKLY THE ANSWER IS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT SETS SAN DIEGO. WE SAID TO OURSELVES OKAY. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE A PROVIDER LOSSES ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING LAST RESORT MEANS LAST RESEARCH GO TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. AND THERE'S A WHOLE INTEREST IN IN THE IN THE C. C. A.'S OF COURSE AND AND SO THE QUESTION IS FOR SAN DIEGO FINE IF YOU WANT TO TRANSFER THAT. THAT OVER THERE TO THE CCA IS WELL THEN FINE BUT THERE HAS TO BE A PRETTY SIX STANDARD. TO MAKE SURE WHOEVER THEY ARE ON THE COULD BE SOME NEW INVENTION IT DOESN'T MATTER WE GOT TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND THE REASON JUST YOUR LAST POINT ON YOUR QUESTION ABOUT REGIONAL COSTS. IT IS REASONABLE COSTS OF COURSE THIS COSTS THAT'S THE IDEA OF KIND OF THE IN THIS FRENCH CHARGE AND WE PUT REASONABLE IN. BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER'S GONNA CHARGE WERE PROTECTING THE CONSUMER SO IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE OF A LONG DISCUSSION AND ALL OF THIS STUFF. AND HOW DO YOU GET FLEXIBILITY TO THIS NEW OR DYNAMIC BUT MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED. AND THEN WORK ON SOMETHING THAT WORKS WITH THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK AND THAT I THINK ANSWERS THE FORM YOUR QUESTIONS BUT WE DID MAKE THOSE CHOICES OKAY BUT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO COME BACK. TO P. JEANNIE F. R. A C. C. A. R. LOST CREDIT RATINGS IN AND COULDN'T BY THE ENERGY THEY NEEDED. WHICH IS A SORT OF THING WE WOULD LOOK AT SAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THE LONG TERM CONTRACTS BECAUSE OUR BALANCE SHEET ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THE PEOPLE WOULD COME BACK THERE'S A FAIRLY SMALL FEE INVOLVED. WITH PEOPLE COMING BACK AND THEY COULD. IN NO WAY IF THERE IF THEY HAD TO GO TO A TIGHT SPOT MARKET. THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY COULD IN FACT GET THERE -- NOT PUT A HUGE BURDEN ON THE SYSTEM FOR THE PEOPLE PARTICULARLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SAY STATE WITH THE WITH THE I. O. U.. THE SUMMER QUIRK YOU'VE IDENTIFIED EXACTLY ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS BILL WHAT THE SCENARIO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ENERGY CRISIS. WHEN ENRON DUMPED? YOU KNOW A A LARGE NUMBER OF HIGH LOAD CUSTOMERS BACK ON THE UTILITIES IN THE PC HAD TO MAKE IT UP AS THEY WENT ALONG. AND THOSE CUSTOMERS THE CAME BACK DID DID END UP PAYING MORE. SO DID THE CUSTOMER SHOULD STATE WE ALL PAID MORE THAT'S RIGHT WE ALL PAY MORE AND IT WAS YOU KNOW A DISASTER. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THIS BILL DOES IS SAY TO THE COMMISSION. FIGURE THIS OUT IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE TO FLY BY THE SEAT OF THE PANTS IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN BUT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS GOING TO BE IN ADVANCE SO THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND KNOWS WHAT THE CHARGE SHOULD BE. IT JUST SEEMS BETTER TO PLAN FOR AN ADVANCE THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT UP ON THE FLY YES SOMEBODY WHO STAYED WITH THE I OWE YOU -- I WOULD FEEL VERY UPSET IF A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE HAD TO COME BACK. AND MY COSTS WENT UP THAT'S THE PURPOSE IN DIFFERENT CHARGE THAT'S THIS WHOLE TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION. BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S UPSET THAT -- YOU PEOPLE OVER HERE WANT TO LEAVE WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US AND WE NEED A SYSTEM TO PROTECT SOCIETY AND THAT'S WHY THESE CHARGES ARE ARE IMPOSED UPON PEOPLE THAT LEAVE WHETHER IT'S DIRECT ACCESS PEOPLE. WHOEVER IT MIGHT YEAH BUT COMING BACK THAT COULD YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE SPOT MARKET IN THE SPOT MARKET IS TIGHT. THEN THAT COULD BE YOU KNOW THEY COULD END UP WITH. THE PROCUREMENT COST BEING TWO OR THREE TIMES WHAT THEY WERE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'D STAYED AND MY CONCERN IS SPREADING THAT OUT TO THE PEOPLE WHO STAYED. ARE SAY THE PEOPLE OF NEWARK OR PLEASANTON THAT DIDN'T JOIN IN THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY. WITH THOSE FOLKS HAVE TO PAY. FOR THE FACT THAT. SCCA COLLAPSED -- I'M SURE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY WELL BUT I'M JUST GIVING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE. AND I'LL GET YOU TO GET TO YOU IN A SECOND BUT MY CONCERN WOULD BE. I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T GO ON TO SAY THAT THE THE COMPANY THAT COLLAPSED SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE COST FOR THE PEOPLE CAME BACK. THAT'S MY BIG CONCERN SOME OCCUR YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH THE RULES TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMERS AREN'T THE ONES COMING BACK YEAH. YEAH SO THEY THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THERE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS BUT IT REALLY THOSE FOLKS SHOULD BE HELD HARMLESS. IF PEOPLE COMING BACK -- SUDDENLY RAISE THE AVERAGE COST OF ENERGY. SO THAT'S MY CONCERN. YES MISS BROWN I MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESPOND THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE AWARE OF ONE IS THAT -- CURRENTLY THE I. O. USED TO SERVE AS THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SO THAT ROLE IS NOT BEING UNFAITHFUL TODAY SECONDLY ON THE COMMISSION HAS A PROCEEDING. THAT - ESTABLISHED A BOND THAT ALL LOW SERVING ENTITIES HAVE TO PAY AND THAT BOND IS MEANT TO COVER ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT COULD BE IN KERN AND PUT UPON ANY CUSTOMERS THAT REMAIN WITH UTILITY. SO THAT IS THE MECHANISM THE FINANCIAL MECHANISM IN PLACE TODAY AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT BOND IS ACTUALLY BASED IN PART ON MARKET PRICES SO AS THE MARKET PRICES OF ENERGY. GO UP -- YOU'LL SEE THAT THE BOND THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO POST GOES UP AS WELL YEAH BUT THOSE ARE THOSE THE SPOT PRICE. PRICES AT THE CLOSE ON SPOT MARKET PRICE PRICES BASED ON SPOT MARKET PRICES MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT. IF WE GET TO THE SITUATION WE HAD IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND ONE THE SPOT MARKET SUDDENLY WENT WAY UP. AND SO I'M NOT SURE THOSE BONDS WILL DO IT NOW. THAT SO WELL I THINK I'VE I'VE GOTTEN THROUGH THAT PART. NOW THERE IS ALSO THE SECOND THING YOU BROUGHT ABOUT YOU TALKED ABOUT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A A FEE PAID TO THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. AND THAT HE IS DETERMINED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND TO PASS THE SENATOR AUTHOR. OR ONE OF YOUR EXPERTS. HOW IS THAT FEE LIKELY TO BE DETERMINED BY THE CPU CD YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE AN IDEA BUT IF YOU DO -- WHAT IS THAT FEE INTENDED TO DO AND HOW IS? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO SET IT. I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A ALREADY THAT THE PC HAS QUITE YOUR TO SET FEES WE PUT THE WORD REASONABLE AN THAT'S THE WHOLE STRUCTURE 90% OF WHAT THEY DO OVER THERE. AS IT RELATES THE ENERGY UTILITY MARKET IS LOOK AT PEOPLE'S REIMBURSEMENT SO WHAT THE COSTS ARE WITH THE RATE OF RETURNS ARE IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AND WE PUT THE WORD REASONABLE IN BECAUSE WE JUST IN ONE SO YOU COULD CHARGE A FEE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE P. YOU SEE THROUGH ITS ORDINARY STRUCTURE -- LIMITS IT TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED -- BUT WHAT WOULD THAT FEES SUPPOSEDLY PAY FOR BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LOT OF COSTS. UNTIL THE THING HAPPENS MAYBE THERE'S SOME PLANNING COSTS BUT I WOULD THINK POLICY WOULD BE FAIRLY LOW I THINK THAT'S TRUE. OKAY SO IT'S TRUE WE WOULD WE COULD ALL IT IS LIKELY IT'LL BE FAIRLY LOW BECAUSE IT ALL IT IS IS PLANNING. IS THAT YOUR AT THIS POINT YES OKAY ACTUALLY IT'S A SMALL NUMBER BUT YOU GOT TO PROVIDE FOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID IT AND WE PUT REASONABLE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS OKAY. UP MISPRINT WAS -- ANOTHER CONCERN YOU HAVE. SO ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WAS THAT -- THAT THE UTILITIES ARE NOT ACTUALLY HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE STANDARDS THAT ARE PUT INTO THE BILL FOR OTHER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO MEET IN ORDER TO BECOME THE POLDER. I DON'T SEE THAT THAT COULD THE AUTHOR. THAT. MIA IT WILL THERE THEY ARE THE POLAR THEY THEY THEY ARE ALREADY REGULAR UTILITY. BY OPERATION OF BUT BUT THAT THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE LAW. I MEAN I I DON'T APOLOGIZE MAYBE JUST MY INABILITY UNDERSTAND BUT THE IDEA THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THEY ALREADY ARE THE POLAR WHAT WE'RE REALLY DOING HERE. IS SAYING OKAY HE'S A PROVIDERS LAST RESORT THAT MEANS YOU'RE IN TROUBLE SOMETHING BIG HAPPENED AND YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IS A GOVERNMENT WE ARE AS WAS INDICATED. PLANNING IN ADVANCE SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AS WE'VE NOW TORN APART THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF OUR ENERGIES PROVIDED. AND COMPLETELY TURNED IT UPSIDE DOWN AND WE SAID WE BETTER MAKE SURE SO WE AVOID ANOTHER ENERGY CRISIS WE HAVE PART OF THAT PLAN THAT SOMEBODY'S A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. AND THE STARTING POINT IS THE EXISTING PEOPLE SO WE'RE NOT DESIGNATING THEM UNDER NEW THINGS THEY ALREADY ARE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT IN THE LAW. THEIR OBLIGATION IS TO SERVE THAT'S WHAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SAYS THAT'S THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'VE KNOWLEDGE WHERE SOMETHING IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS JUST ONE DOLLAR YEAH WILL NOT LET ME. TO MY REGARDING OUR IT IS BETTER TO JUST FOR A SECOND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY MISSING SOMETHING APOLOGY YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING BUT I DO WANT YOU TO FILL BUT YOU. ASKED THE QUESTION BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ASKED HAS BEEN ANSWERED OR A COUPLE DIFFERENT ALL RIGHT NOW THIS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS [inaudible] ARE THE IF THE CPU CA BECAME A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEM BE ANY DIFFERENT THAN THEY WOULD BE FOR AND I OWE YOU. IN MY READING OF THE BILL IS THAT THEY BE THE SAME THEY BECOME A PUBLICLY REGULATED UTILITY. AND THEY WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME REGULATIONS AS THE PUBLIC. ART PUBLICLY REGULATED UTILITY BUT IS THAT THE CASE OR IS IT DIFFERENT -- DOCTOR QUIRK AND THE VERY LAST PAGE OF THE BILL WHICH SAYS THAT. IF THE IF EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY BECAME THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. IT WOULD BE REGULATED AS A PUBLIC UTILITY FOR THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT SERVICES. BUT JUST FOR THOSE SERVICES. OKAY SO THEY WOULD BE AGAIN IT'S AT THIS SO OF THE THREE OBJECTIONS. ONE OF THEM IS THE FEE WHICH WOULD BE LOW. THE OTHER IS THAT -- THAT THEY WOULD BE REGULATED IN THE SAME WAY NOT A DIFFERENT WAY. SO I DON'T SEE THAT THE MAIN CONCERN THAT I THINK YOU STILL HAVE THOUGH IS THAT -- THE DEFAULT IS THE IS STILL GOING TO BE THE ARM UTILITY THE UTILITY AND YOUR CONCERN THAT THAT SHOULDN'T BE THE CASE. I'M CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE TO OBTAIN THE UTILITIES PERMISSION IN ORDER TO APPLY TO BE THE PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AND I ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE TO APPLY AND MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS. THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED THEY CAN HIT. LOOK AT FINANCING OF I HAVE NO I I I JUST DON'T BUY THAT ARGUMENT. I THINK THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR BUT LET'S GET BACK TO IT WHY DID YOU MAKE THE I. O. U.'S HAVE TO GET PERMISSION WHY NOT JUST LET THE C. P. U. C. DECIDE. IF I COULD -- DOCTOR QUIRK ARNOLD IF YOU CAN ANSWERED -- BUT THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE TO DOT -- SHARE THIS MATTER SUCI AND SORT OF GIVE OTHERS A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON IT BUT SENATOR IF YOU. LIKE THE ANSWERS IN THE MARK ALSO ADD INTO THIS STUFF WITH THE ANSWER REALLY IS IS THAT THEY ARE THE PRIOR PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AND THEY GOT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT WHOEVER'S TAKING OVER HAS THE FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO DO IT THIS IS A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT THIS IS THE EMERGENCY PLAN. AND SO WE HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. AND WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT STRUCTURE WE HAVE THESE THEY KNOW THE POPE POLLS ANOTHER WIRES AND OTHER SYSTEMS IN ORDER THE IT'S GOING ON THERE THE PEOPLE THAN THE MAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS THIS THE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE IN THE THING WHETHER IT'S DIRECT ACCESS OR WHATEVER THE OTHER PLAYERS ARE. HAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE MARKETS AND STUFF AND IT SEEMS TO ME IS THAT IT'S THE MOST PRUDENT THING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE. AND AND IT IT ALSO TO ME IS THE BEST CHECK AND BALANCE ON THE DEAL INSTEAD OF JUSTGOING TO THE GOVERNMENT SAYING OKAY YOU GO FIGURE THIS OUT LET'S GIVE THEM SOMETHING ELSE TO DO ON TOP THE WILDFIRES -- I SEE ALL RIGHT WELL I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THEN THANK YOU I UNDERSTAND -- MISSED RESEARCH. THANK YOU I THINK A MOST OF MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED -- BUT SENATOR. THIS IS A LITTLE -- FOCUSING ON THE ISSUE OF WHY THEY'RE IN THERE NEEDS TO BE A JOINT APPLICATION SO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT THAT IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE THE EXISTING POLAR AND AND THAT SOMEHOW NOT JUST THE P. YOU SEE BUT THE UTILITY. SHOULD SOMEHOW BE AN A VETTING PROCESS -- IN IN TERMS OF THE POLAR THAT WOULD REPLACE THAT I OWE YOU YEAH EXACTLY I MEAN NOT NOT IT'S ONLY THIS IS A LAST RESORT THIS THE EMERGENCY PLAN THIS THE RIP CORD. AND THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT TO A BUNCH OF FOLKS IN THE PC FIND THEY CAN REVIEW IT. BUT CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE THE THE THE BASICALLY THE CATBIRD SEAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OF PLANNING AND WORKING SO HARD. SHOULD TAKE THE FIRST SCRUB AT IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO BEING HAVING SOMEBODY ELSE HOLD THAT RECORD. THE EVENT THAT THERE'S URGENCY AND I JUST IT'S JUST A REAL KIND OF CONSERVATIVE RESPONSIBLE APPROACH. TO WHAT SHOULD SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN TO AN ENERGY CRISIS ADD TO LIVE THROUGH IT AND YOU WE CAN'T TAKE A RISK AND SO THE IDEA IS IF IT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER STANDARD. SO BE IT LET'S PROTECT PEOPLE AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE AND NOT JUST TURN IT TO THE P. UC BUT CREATE PART OF TO CHARGES THAT THEY GOT TO GO THROUGH BED BED GIVEN THAT YOU'RE. SUCH A YOU KNOW STUDENT OF HISTORY AND THAT YOU ALWAYS SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HISTORY WITH US -- BEAT IS NEEDED TO TRUE THAT. TO THERE THERE HAVE BEEN -- THERE IS A HISTORY OF UTILITIES THAT ARE BUT THAT OR TRY TO UNDERMINE -- CCA'S -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE FOR ST GETTING STRAIGHT YES OF COURSE. AND LET'S NOT THE HOUSE HERE WE PASSED THE CCA'S ROSTER Là TWO THOUSAND ONE GIRL MEGAN'S BILL IS INTENDED FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PURPOSE IT'S NOW BUT ALL CHANGE I HAVE NO OBJECTION. I ONLY CARE THAT THAT BALANCE SHEETS ARE REAL AND THEY COULD REALLY DO IT IN LA COUNTY WAS THIRTEEN MAYBE IT SEVENTY EIGHTY PEOPLE ON ANOTHER GREAT PEOPLE I KNOW MOST OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE. BUT THIS IS THE REAL DEAL AND LET'S JUST MAKE SURE IT WORKS THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT BUT YES OF COURSE. IS BEEN TENSIONS THERE'S I USED TO BE THE SOLAR BUSINESSES TENSIONS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY THAN I AM IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS I'M JUST THINKING THIS IS SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR GOVERNMENT. THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT'S ALL AND THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN THAT PROVIDER AND THEY BETTER MAKE SURE THAT THE NEW PEOPLE CAN TAKE OVER THE CONTROLS. ALL RIGHT WELL I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE JOINT APPLICATION BUT I'LL STILL BE BETTER FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OF SENATOR THANK YOU I'VE YOU'VE CERTAINLY MADE THE CASE WE DO APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED -- BY THE CCA -- INDUSTRY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MAIN THE MARKET CONTINUES TO GET FRAGMENTED AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW ALL OF THIS ULTIMATELY COMES TOGETHER AND SOLIDIFIES DOWN THE ROAD. BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WHEN WE SEE SUCH -- DISRUPTION IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT -- WHEN THAT THE I. O. U.'S ARE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUTURE -- HAVING SOME TYPE OF SYMBOL OF PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT -- SEEMS TO BE A PRUDENT. WAY TO GO -- BUT WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MARKET PLACE CONTINUES TO BE VIABLE FOR SOME DAYS TO CONTINUE TO GROW TO CONTINUE TO MOVE AND EXPAND IN THERE IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GROW INTO. AND WE DON'T WANT TO CUT THAT SHORT BELIEVE ME -- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HAS A SINGULAR FOCUS AND THAT IS. IF -- AS YOU PUT IT -- THE NEED TO PULL THE RIPCORD -- PRESENTS ITSELF THAT WERE NOT STUMBLING AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. REALIZE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A RECORD FULL. TIME SO -- WE ARE RECOMMENDING.

YOU'RE HERE -- FOR SEVEN SB. FIVE TWENTY FOUR YES SIR WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS. TRY TO MAKE IT LOOK AS EASY AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY THERE. PURSUIT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FIRST FIRST OFF I WANTED TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING. TO THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS APPRECIATE THE STAFF WORK ON THIS. ONE THAT EXCLUDES THE ADDITIONAL LABOR COSTS CAUSED BY USE WITH SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE IN THE COST EFFECTIVENESS TEST AND ONE THAT ENSURES THAT -- THERE'S SOME CLARITY AROUND WHAT IS IN IS IN AN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'VE COME. TO SOME GOOD AGREEMENT. BETWEEN -- OURS ARE SUPPORT SPONSORS AND SOME OF THE OPPONENTS CONCERNS AS WELL AS THE CHAIR SO I APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE ON THAT. BOOK WE NEED GOOD QUALITY WORK GOING ON WHEN IT COMES THE ENERGY EFFICIENCIES SPACE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE PAYING. FOR PROJECTS THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT RECEIVING THE BENEFITS FROM -- THE SHODDY WORK GOING ON OUT THERE -- FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL PROJECTS -- THAT WHERE INSPECTIONS ARE TOUGH TO TO ENFORCE AND WE'RE REALLY NOT ACHIEVING THE BENEFITS BOTH ON GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION SIDE BUT ALSO ON A WORK FORCE FAIRNESS SIDE I THINK. IT'S SOMETHING WEVE GOT A REMEDY. THE THE SPACE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THE FACT IS THE CONTRACT NEED TO DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE GONNA DO AND HOPEFULLY THIS IMPROVES THE QUALITY. OF THE PROJECTS GOING ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HE'S OUR WORKERS ALSO WERE WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE PAID AND MOVES US pEMISSIONS -- GOALS AT THE SAME TIME -- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR DIG INTO SOME DETAILS. HAVE SCOTT WHICH HERE -- BUT TO HELP WITH THAT AS WELL AND THE RESPECT THE ASPIRIN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH A BEHALF THE SPONSORS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL. THE STATE'S ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS -- THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS AT THE P. YOU SEE THE REBATE PROGRAM SO YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT HAVE OPERATED FOR YEARS. I THINK THEY YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIVE IF I'M NOT INCORRECT -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT IF YOU SEE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RETURN FOR THE DOLLAR THAT WE COULD WE'RE NOT MAXIMIZING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETURN THAT WE COULD BE GETTING. AND ONE OF THE TOP REASONS THAT THEY HAVE PINPOINTED IS BECAUSE OF IT -- SHODDY OR INAPPROPRIATE INSTALLATIONS OR INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE DONE IN A WAY THAT MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCIES THAT COULD BE OBTAINED. SO WITH THIS BILL DOES IS WOULD APPLY ON JUST PROJECTS OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR GREATER RICHARD LARGE. COMMERCIAL PROJECTS -- PREVAILING WAGE AND A REQUIREMENT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE WORK FORCE BE A SKILLED THAT CONTRACTORS TO DO THE THAT LARGE SCALE WORK. HAVE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE -- WE THINK IT'S A REASONABLE COMPROMISE WERE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PROJECTS A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE ARE VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. LESS THAN FIVE I THINK WAS LISTEN TO THAT WELL I WON MISS WHAT I THINK IS LESS THAN 5% OF THE PROJECTS. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT. I SO WE WERE TRYING TO APPLY THIS REQUIREMENT DOWN TO SOMEBODY COMING INTO A HOUSE TO REPLACE A A WATER HEATER. INSTALL HIGH EFFICIENCY PUMP ON A POOL -- BUT REALLY JUST LARGE COMMERCIAL PROJECTS WERE TALKING ABOUT COOLING TOWERS HE REPLACING HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING UNITS PUTTING IN -- ADVANCED LIGHTING CONTROLS SOPHISTICATED PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE A SOPHISTICATED WORKFORCE. SO WE WERE WOULD BE HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS WITH ORIGIN I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS THERE ANYONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK -- OR TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. I CHAIR NUMBERS I TO BE FOUNDER PRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FISSION SEE END OF A MANAGEMENT COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY -- AND REGRETTABLY OPPOSE AMENDED TO THE BILL AND WE REPRESENT OVER SEVENTY COMPANIES WHO DO THE LARGEST BUILDING COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND WE CAN'T SUPPORT IT SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE. OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF HAS BEEN WONDERFUL BUT WORKING ON AMENDMENTS IN YOUR PRE SHEET THE EFFORTS OF THE STAFF AUTHOR -- AND THE SPONSOR UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT -- AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THE COSTS IMPACTS OF THIS NEW APARTMENT BUT THEY DO NOT OFFSET THE COST. WITHOUT AN OFFSET THE INCENTIVE FOR LARGE PROJECTS SUCH AS REFINERIES AND FOOD PROCESSING WHICH LIVER THE MOST UP HOWEVER SB THREE FIFTY BENEFITS. TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM DISAPPEAR. ENTIRELY BECAUSE THE COST OF THE PROJECT IS GREATER THAN THE BENEFIT. FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE OFFERED AMENDMENTS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE COMPLETE COST OFFSET WE ARE HOPEFUL THE AUTHOR SPONSOR AND COMMITTEE WILL ACCEPT THESE MOMENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. I THINK YOU HAVE A COUPLE YOUR TALK ABOUT THIS. JUST HAVE WHICH GET CLEAR HERE I'M JUST BECAUSE I BECAUSE I I THOUGHT WE HAD TALKED THROUGH A MEN'S WITH BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. TALK ABOUT PROJECTS THAT UTILIZES SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE SHALL BE PRESUMED TO HAVE. A 1100% NET REALIZATION RATE IS SOUNDING FAMILIAR FOR PURPOSES OF ANY A COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES AND BE DETERMINATION OF AND USE CONSUMER OR CONTRACTOR INCENTIVES. LOOK INTO YOUR CONSULTANT. FIVE THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE. WHAT WAS DISCUSSED? WE WERE FOUND YES THERE OKAY WITH THAT AND THAT THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU ALL -- DO I NEED TO GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD THE AUTHOR TO AGREE -- TO SO THOSE THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SO THIS DOES NOT CAPTURE THE SPIRIT OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS OR IS THIS. I'M SORRY. THE COMEDIAN ALICE'S REFLECTS WHAT WOULD BE THE INCREASED COST THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORK FORCE REQUIREMENT. IN WOULD ALLOW FOR COSTS JUDGMENT BASED ON THAT. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT OKAY HOUSE -- MISTER CHAIR I YES SO I HAVE YOU HAVE YOU ALL SEEN THAT THE LANGUAGE I JUST READ OFF IS THAT BEEN REVIEWED BY THE CHAIR. OKAY -- THAT WAS A COMPROMISE I WAS HOPING WE COULD LAND ON IT WAS GOOD WITH THE PROPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS HERE TODAY -- SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HERE -- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I WAS ACCEPTING. YES. IN A MONTH. IN MY TESTIMONY I WAS SPEAKING TO WHAT WAS ALLEN AND COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS. FOR TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOAL THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS BUT I THINK WE TAKES MORE CONVERSATION BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE COMMITTEE PROPOSED GUIDE. I MEAN I'M I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH. SORT OF AN AUDIBLE ON THE LINE WHERE WE HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO I'M SO SORRY I DID NOT INTEND THIS TO BE AN AUDIBLE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS LOST AND IN TRANSLATION HERE -- WE HAD THAT LANGUAGE. I THINK WE'RE GOOD WITH WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US -- BUT I MEAN I BUT THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN. I UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT I ALSO. RECOGNIZE THAT THE THE COMMITTEE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE OKAY THE ANALYSISAND BECAUSE I'M NOT REFUTED AND NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO THE SAME PLACE BUT I I I'M. A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE AT THIS MOMENT -- ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMMITTEE NOT HAVING HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY. REVIEW IT AND APPRECIATE. THE HARMONIOUS -- ELEMENTS OF IT THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE I I JUST. I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE LOCKED AND WHERE WE ARE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT BUT HOW FIRMLY LOCKED ARE YOU IF WE CAN WORK WITH -- BOTH PROPONENTS AND THE OPPOSITION AS WE PROCEED I DON'T WANT TO AND AROUND THE COMMITTEE STAFF BUT BUT WHAT I WOULD I GUESS MY MY OFFER OR MY THOUGHT WOULD BE. IF WE CAN CALL THIS A TRY TO US THIS IS THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE ON THIS ONE SO I I'M -- IF YOU KNOW I ONE OF ONE OR TWO WHEN WE LET'S LET THE OPPOSITION -- GOOD ARE YOU HERE FOR A TEST MONNING FINISH THE TESTIMONY AND LET'S FACE. IT WILL. SURE -- MATT CLUB SCENE ON BEHALF OF THECALIFORNIA SOLAR IN START ASSOCIATION I REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR WITH THE AMENDMENTS FOR OUR SECTION IN THE ANALYSIS WE'D BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION -- WANTED AND JUST QUICKLY FLAG THAT ONE OF THE CITATIONS TECHNICALLY ARE IS REPEALED BY SUNSET AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR -- WE THINK THAT LEDGE COUNCIL CAN FIX THAT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. LET'S SEE -- NO ONE ELSE. ANYONE WITH ANY MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO PUT ON THE TABLE -- LET ME TURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO REFLECT ON DR QUIRK. SO WHAT THE THE OPPOSITION AT THE TABLE FROM THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY COUNSEL IS ASKING. FOR IS IF THE LABOR IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAT THERE BE -- MONEY FROM THE FUND PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL LABOR. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL COST. BOB. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. OF THE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT ARE SPENT ON THIS HOW MUCH ARE IN THESE LARGE PROJECTS. AND FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S A REFINERY I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE UNION LABOR ALREADY. MANY OF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE UNION LABOR. CAN YOU DEFINE SOME OF THE PROJECTS WHICH ARE NOT UNION LABORER HOW MANY ARE THERE HOW BIG AN ISSUE IS THIS MISS. SOME OF A RECORD I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF IF MY MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECT. THE IT'S IT'S ROOM A ONE ROUND PROJECTS GO TO THESE LARGE COMMERCIAL PRIZE THAT'S FROM THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE NOW SAYS IF I RECALL CORRECTLY -- SO IT WOULD DEPEND ON YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT -- YOU KNOW MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF THIS TYPE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE IN IS BEING DONE. WITH CONTRACTORS THAT TYPICALLY WOULD BE. UNIONIZED CONTRACTORS IN THE BAY AREA MOST OF ALL THE BAY AREA AND FRESNO IN. IN -- IN LOS ANGELES IN SAN DIEGO IN PLACES LIKE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY WOULDN'T BE -- BUT TO THE AMENDMENT I THOUGHT THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. GOT TO THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S A VERY SLIGHT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND WE'RE WE THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES. GETS TO THE POINT -- BUT THAT'S YOU CANNOT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR ON TRYING -- TO MARY THESE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT FAR OFF FROM THE THE WORD SMITHING THAT THE OPPOSITION WAS CONCERNED WITH AND STILL FEELING THE INTENT OF THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS WHICH WAS ABOUT. TO REITERATE FOR THOSE FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS IN THE WEEDS HERE. I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE HOUSES PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION ANY ADDITIONAL LABOR COSTS THIS IS YOUR LINE RESULTING FROM THE USE WAS SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH. CERTAIN CHAPTERS SHALL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROJECT COSTS OF THE COMMISSION'S COST EFFECTIVENESS TESTS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE NOW SAYS. WHAT I JUST MENTIONED IS THAT? THEY'RE PRESUMED TO HAVE A 1100% NET REALIZATIONRATE FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES. AND THE DETERMINATION OF AND USE CONSUMER OR CONTRACTOR INCENTIVES SO I THINK IT'S SORT OF ON THAT. THAT PIECE OF IT -- SO I'M OPEN TO WORKING THAT THROUGH I JUST LIKE THE LANDED WELL. WE'LL LET ME LET ME JUST SAY. AND I APPRECIATE THE THE EFFORT AT THIS POINT TO TRY TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING TO MARRY THE TWO BUT I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- WAS VERY THOROUGH VERY COMPLETE BASED ON UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS IN FRONT OF US THAT IT ALSO IN. VAULT COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE P. YOU SEE -- AND SO THIS ANALYSIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH A LOT OF CARE AND I THINK THOUGHTFULNESS AND SO -- WE'LL HAVE IT MY RECOMMENDATION IS -- THIS BILL MOVES WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REFLECTS ON AND I I'M SORRY THAT SOMETHING DID WHATEVER HAPPENED. HAPPENED BUT IT WE WE TOOK WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF US WE ANALYZE IT AND WE MOVED FORWARD FOR THE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE BILL. CUT THE MOTION THAT MOTEL OKAY. THE TICKET AND I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY. A LOT SECOND THE MOTION BUT THAT THE MOTION BE THAT -- THE BILL'S MOVED TO THE AMENDMENTS AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SO THAT'S BEEN MODE AND SECOND. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DR YEAH I WOULD JUST SUGGESTED AT THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY. PROJECTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS. AS WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IF IN FACT PROJECTS GET. DON'T GET DONE WHICH IS WHAT YOUR CONCERN IS THEY END UP COSTING 50% MORE WHICH I DOUBT HAPPENS FIRST OF ALL MOST OF THEM ARE PROBABLY ALREADY LABOR -- HIGH CLASS LABOR LABOR UNIONS BUT IF I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU FINDTHAT THERE IS AN ISSUE HERE THAT YOU BRING IT BACK -- NEXT YEAR AND THAT WE LOOK AT THAT AS A SEPARATE ISSUE. GIVE UP I THINK WE CAN RESOLVE THIS MISTER JEFF I MIGHT EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE RESTORED I UNDERSTAND. THERE WE HAVE BEFORE US AND THE MOTION INCLUDES THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTHING ADDED TO IT AT THIS POINT SO I THINK THAT THE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION ON WORD SMITHING IS OFF THE TABLE AT THIS MOMENT -- SPUR SEARCHING. NOT ON THE AMENDMENT BUT JUST. GENERALLY MAY MAY MAKE A COMMENT. YES THANK YOU -- BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO THE INDICATE MY SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT AND I I SEE A THE SUFFERED THE SERVER STERN AS PART OF OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT AS WE WORK TOWARDS -- GREENER AND CLEANER ECONOMY THAT WE MAKE THAT TRANSITION WITH UNION JOBS. AND THAT I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF OF CREATING AND PROTECTING UNION JOBS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR GREEN ECONOMY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. A WE DO HAVE A MOTION IT'S BEEN SECONDED SENATOR YOU HAVE A CLOSE. SURE -- BEFORE I CLOSE CAN I GET THE COMMENT FROM THE OPPOSITION ABOUT WHAT THEIR OUTSTANDING ISSUE WOULD BE WITH THE KERN AMENDS -- I KNOW WHAT THAT WILLOWS WILL GOING FORWARD WE WILL LET THE TWO OF YOU DISCUSS THAT AFTER WE'RE TAKING A VOTE ALMOST LIKE THAT FOR THE COMMITTEE YOU CAN GET IT FLAG AND THEN SLUGGERS AFTERWARDS A STARK AN IMPACT ON WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY.

THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR OF MEMBERS WE ARE HERE TODAY 2% ASSEMBLY BILL. TEN FIFTY FOUR NOT JUST BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON OUR STATE. BUT BECAUSE OF THE INCREDIBLE DEVASTATION CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HAVE INFLICTED ON THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS. THE COST TO CONSIST COSTUMERS AND THE IMPACT ON SOLVENCY OF ARE THE PROVIDERS OF POWER TO ALL OF US. CLIMATE CHANGE HAS CREATED A NEW WILDFIRE REALITY FOR CALIFORNIA. THE STATE'S FIRE SEASON IS NOW ALMOST YEAR ROUND. MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ACRES OF CALIFORNIA WILD LANDS ARE CLASSIFIED AS UNDER VERY HIGH OR EXTREME FIRE THREAT. APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE. LIVES LIVES IN THE HIGH RISK AREA. UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS IGNITING AN EXCESSIVE BUILDUP OF DRY BRUSH FROM POOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IN SOME AREAS BUT INCREASING OCCURRENCES OF HIGHWAY AND LOW HUMIDITY IS INCREASING THE CONTACT BETWEEN UTILITY LINES ENTRIES BECAUSE AN IGNITION. EXACERBATED FURTHER BY DEAD AND DRUG DYING TREES [inaudible] THE RESULT. FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHETHER YOU TO THE UTILITY WAS PPROVED MANAGER OF ITS EQUIPMENT OR NELIGH NEGLIGENT OPERATOR. UTILITY OPERATOR EXPOSURE TO GREATER LIABILITY FROM CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IS BECOMING THE NORM. AND MORE OF OUR NEIGHBORS THE VICTIMS OF THE DEVASTATION. COSTS EXCEEDING INSURANCE PROTECTION DOWNGRADING CREATED CREDIT WORTHINESS AND INCREASING POTENTIAL FOR BANKRUPTCY HAS COMPROMISED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SAFE RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE POWER. TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AB FIFTEEN TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR UNPRECEDENTED SAFETY INVESTMENTS BY THE I. O. U.'S WITHOUT PROFITS FOR SHAREHOLDERS. FORCE THEY ARE USED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR WHILE FIRE SAFETY RECORD AND PERFORMANCE AND PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND TAXPAYERS FROM HOLY BEARING THE COST OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. FACILITATE CUSTOMER ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER BY PROVIDING A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROMTHE UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL ESTABLISHES A NEW WHILE FIRE SAFETY DIVISION ADDITIONALLY WITHIN THE CPUC. NO LATER THAN JULY TWENTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE DIVISION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY. INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE BILLS ALSO ESTABLISH PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WELFARE PROCEEDINGS AND STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR COMMUNITY. A NEW PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD. ESTABLISHED WELFARE FUND AND MECHANISMS TO CAPITALIZE THE WILDFIRE FUND. I'LL NOW TURN THE OF PRESENTATION OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS OF FOR THEM TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO SHARE WITH YOU AS WELL BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. NOTHING IS CHAIRMAN OF JUST TO KEEP MY COMMENTS -- SHORT -- COULD BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS IS BEEN A LONG PATH THAT TO GET HERE I THINK LAST YEAR. A MANY OF US ON THIS -- COMMITTEE SPENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- BACK IN JANUARY I HAD AUTHORED A CATASTROPHIC WELFARE FUND BILLS I HAD MET I THINK CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OF YOU -- WE'VE -- BEEN UP THIS WEEK AFTER THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE AS THE LANGUAGE FROM FROM LAST WEEK IN AND I THINK I'VE I'VE SAT DOWN -- WITH EVERYONE OF YOU THOUGH I THINK I WILL ADD TO THIS IS THIS IS NOT. A PARTISAN ISSUE HI THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC BILL IT IS NOT A REPUBLICAN BILL -- IT IS -- BUT AS OUR BILL -- AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TO BE PRAISED. OF FOR THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IN WHICH THEY'VE THEY'VE WORKED I BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS -- TOGETHER AND I'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OUT MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS I IT SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO CREATE A FUND FOR FUTURE FIRES I'M WITHOUT THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED THIS BILL WOULD ONLY REALLY SERVE AS A TEMPORARY FIX TO WHAT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN ONGOING PROBLEM -- AT A PLAN TO ADDRESS WILD FIRES IN THE STATE MUST BE COMPREHENSIVE AND RESULTS REDUCING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES FROM OCCURRING IN THE FIRST PLACE -- THE CHAIR WENT OVER AT THE NEW SAFETY AND CAL BILLY BILLY STANDARDS -- AND A PROTECTIONS A CALIFORNIA'S -- WILL HAVE AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL -- AND ALSO THE COMPANION BILLS -- IN ESSENCE -- THE THE OUTBOARD THAT WE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE ARE CREATING WILL NOT STAY WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COMMITTEE. IT WILL START UNDER THE PC BUT IT WILL NOT REMAIN UNDER THE P. C. AS OF AS PER THE CHERUB GEN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WILL BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE PC TO OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY -- AND WHAT THIS WILL DO WILL HELP ENSURE THAT ALL LECTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IS REVIEWED ASSESS BY EXPERTS FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING BEST PRACTICE FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION. ALSO WORTH MENTIONING IS THE I'LL USE WILL HAVE TO SPEND FIVE BILLION IN AGGREGATE ON FIRE SAFETY A MITIGATION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AND SHAREHOLDERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN A RATE OF RETURN OR PROFIT FROM THIS INVESTMENT -- ENCOURAGING INCREASED WELFARE SAFETY SPENDING AND HIGHER UTILITY SAFETY STANDARDS REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES -- AND IT WHICH WAS RESULT IN SAVINGS TO THE STATE AND CONSUMERS. I DID FISH CHILI IF THE BILL'S SUCCESSFUL REDUCE FOR FUTURE RELATED FIRES FINANCIAL RISK UTILITY CREDIT RATINGS CAN REMAIN STABLE AND EVEN IMPROVE. ACCORDING TO THE LA -- EVERY TIME THE BOND RATING AGENCIES DOWNGRADE THE UTILITIES THERE IS A CORRESPONDING INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR THE LEXICAL CORPORATIONS. IN ADDITION TO SAVING REPAIR MONEY THIS BILL TAKES STEPS TO DECREASE THE CHANCE OF FUTURE FIRES INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SAFETY CERTIFICATION WITHIN. THE ADVISORY BOARD THAT REQUIRES UTILITIES TO TIE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TO SAFETY PERFORMANCE CREATED SAFETY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPLY WITH WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND PASS A SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT. FURTHERMORE AS THE CHAIR STATE TO CREATE A NEW PRETTY MANAGEMENT STANDARD THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE FORK STANDARD DEPRIVE PROVIDE MORE CLARITY TO THE UTILITIES. THE PROVISIONS OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND ITS COMPANION BILLS WILL ALLOW YOU UTILITIES TO OFFER SAFE AND AFFORDABLE POWER THROUGH THE STATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT ENDEAVORS TO MINIMIZE AND PREVENT UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN DOING SO WE CAN PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FROM BECOMING VICTIMS NOT ONLY OF THE DEVASTATION AND DESTRUCTION OF WILDFIRES. BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF UTILITY COSTS AS WELL AND WITH THAT AS WELL AND WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM OTHER -- RESEARCHER IF I COULD -- BUT WE HAVE I AM A PORT THAT WE HAVE -- AUTOMOTIVE SALAS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHO'S HERE -- FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ALSO TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAVE AND WE HAVE BETTER MCCOLLUM WHO'S HERE FOR REPRESENTING A FROM THE ASHES. OF WHO WILL. ONE OF OUR WITNESSES OKAY. BASICALLY A COUPLE OF MINUTES. BUT I'M GONNA BE GENEROUS WITH THE CLOCK. ARE ON BOTH SIDES SO THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM PATRICK MCCALLUM I AM REPRESENTING A GROUP CALLED UP FROM THE ASHES -- UP FROM THE ASHES REPRESENTS THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND VICTIMS THAT HAVE SUFFERED FROM I. O. U. CAUSE FIRES OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE BUTTE FIRE THE THOMAS THE WALLS THE THE NORTH BAY. AND THE CAMPFIRES THERE'S ALSO FORTY ONE LAW FIRMS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IT. AND WE ARE HERE A TODAY A FIRST OF ALL. MY COLLEAGUES THERE ARE SOME VICTIMS TO VICTIMS THAT ARE HERE. THAT I DON'T SEE THEM IN THE ON ITS SCOTT WOULD YOU HELP. WOULD YOU GUYS MIND COMING UP BECOME RIGHT BEHIND THE FIRST PERSON IN THERE AND STUFF THIS THE FIRST TIME THEY TESTIFIED THAT IT'S IT'S A MOTIONAL TO TELL THEIR STORIES. THE WILDFIRES. AS MR MAYES INDICATED DO NOT DISCRIMINATE. THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES IN YOU'RE GONNA HEAR THEIR STORIES -- IS VERY POWERFUL AS YOU'VE HEARD MY STORY. CHANGES YOUR LIFE FOREVER. AND WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY IS WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS IS ON HIS THREE ISSUES. WHAT DOES IT DO FOR SAFETY? AND ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT IT DEALS WITH SAFETY. HOW DOES IT IMPACT RATE PAYERS AND FINALLY WHAT DOES IT DO FOR CURRENT VICTIMS? SO. WE PUT TOGETHER LAST YEAR YOU PUT YOU PUT TOGETHER LAST YEAR AND SB NINE A ONE A SERIES OF STANDARDS AND SAFETY MEASURES. THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES IN OUR MIND WAS THE INDEPENDENT MONITORS COULD GO ONE PLACE. WE PRESENTED THE JUDGE ALSOP THAT A FIFTY PAGE RECOMMENDATIONS HE'S ADOPTED THAT THE CPUC IS ADOPTED THAT. THIS LEGISLATION IS COMPREHENSIVE IN SAFETY. WHAT WE WORRIED ABOUT AND WHAT YOU WORRIED ABOUT IS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS YOU WILL SEE PROTECT THE P. JEANNIE AND ADDISON? VERY AGGRESSIVE BROWN WHAT AGGRESSIVE BROWN WHILE FIRE SAFETY. WHAT ENSURES US THREE YEARS FOR FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS FROM NOW THAT THEY'VE DONE IT? THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS PUT TOGETHER A DEPARTMENT AND A CERTIFICATION ANNA PROCESS WITH WITH VERY WITH PEOPLE WITH THOSE TALENTS TO ENSURE THAT MEASUREMENT CONTINUES AND IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENS IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS. AND THAT'S BEEN THE PAST IT'S BEEN IN PLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT IS A CRITICAL PIECE WE HAVE READ IT. WE'VE MET WITH THE GOVERNOR WITH THAT WITH THE STAFF WE'VE TALKED EACH OF YOU COLLECTIVELY. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WITH THAT IN PLACE. WE WILL BE MUCH MORE ASSURED THAT THE DEVASTATIONS THAT WE SAW IN THOSE BIG FOR FIRES WILL BE LESS DEVASTATION LESS IMPACTED TO HAPPEN. THAT'S THE FIRST THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE WITH THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR SAFETY WITH CLEAR STANDARDS WITHIN IT. EIGHT PAIRS. VERY COMPLICATED AND ANALYSIS -- BUT THERE ARE FOUR FIVE DIFFERENT FACTORS ARE THE CHANGE IT. BUT IF YOU DO PASSED IF YOU DON'T PASS THIS. THEN IT'LL BE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES FOR REPAIRS OUR ANALYSIS IS WE HEARD FROM A BERKELEY PROFESSOR -- AND SENATE UTILITIES IS A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS FOR P. JEANNIE AND EDISON CUSTOMERS WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB. TEN FIFTY FOR A WEEK TO WALK THROUGH THE FOUR FIVE WAYS IT GETS THERE. AND IT'S IN THIS IS A SOON TO BE THE W. R. CAPITALIZATION AS AN INCREASE NOT AS A CONTINUATION. AND IT'S FOR IT. IN A DIFFERENT FACTORS IT'S PROBABLY NEUTRAL TO A SLIGHT INCREASE FOR EDISON CUSTOMERS SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FLOOD. DECREASE AND FEES FOR MOST OF THOSE -- CUSTOMERS. IN REGARDS TO VICTIMS -- THERE ARE THREE AREAS THAT IT HELPS VICTIMS PROVIDES MAJOR LEVERAGE IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH P. JEANNIE AND SOME LEVERAGE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THAT ISN'T. THE FIRST PIECE IN IT IS THAT IT HAS I AM GOING. TO ASK THAT. WE WE GET TO A CONCLUSION. ASK THE CPUS WE'VE BEEN GENEROUSLY P. AND WE STILL WELL ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY CELEBRITY SUMMARIZE IT. TOO CERTIFIED THE VICTIMS ARE MADE WHOLE THE SECOND IT GETS TO A SPEEDIER AGREEMENT AND BANKRUPTCY AND THIRTY IS A HEALTHIER COMPANY GOING FORWARD SO WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OTHERS -- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE ADD NAME AND POSITION. ACTUALLY MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN I THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN BEHALF OF THE OF THE BILL. SIT IN THE CHAIR AND YOU GET THE TIME. THANK YOU GO AHEAD SCOTT WHICH WOULD BE A MINUTES OKAY. YES -- OUT WHICH ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES ONE THING I'D I'D LIKE TO JUST CORRECT FROM MISTER MCCOLLUM'S TESTIMONY IS I THINK THIS CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS A ZERO RATE IMPACT REPAIRS -- IN THIS PRESENTATION IN THIS PACKAGE AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY WE SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED. THIS TO PROVISIONS PARTICULARLY FOR WORKERS CURRENTLY SECTION. EIGHT FIFTY FOUR OF THE UTILITIES CODE PROVIDES THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A MERGER OR ACQUISITION. OF A TELECOM OR UTILITY THERE IT GOES BEFORE THE C. P. U. C. FOR A REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THIS THAT ENSURES THAT THE ISSUES AFFECTING WORKERS ARE PENSIONS MIGHT WE HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND TO CHILE WORKERS AND I ARE USING CALIFORNIA ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND RETIREES. THERE'S LANGUAGE WE LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORS FOR ENSURING THAT PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF REVIEW AND PROTECTION. FOR WORKERS THE SECOND SIGNIFICANT THING THAT THAT SECTION DOES IS CURRENTLY FIFTY FOUR DOES NOT. IS NOT APPLICABLE WHERE YOU HAVE A SELLING OF ASSETS BY A UTILITY AND THAT'S REALLY WAS NEVER A CONCERN WHEN WE HAD INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS OWNING UTILITIES NOW THAT WE HAVE. PRIVATE EQUITY WE HAVE HEDGE FUNDS THAT ARE ARE OWNING MOST OF OUR UTILITIES THE CONCERN IS THAT THEY MAY GO IN AT SOME POINT AND START CHOPPING UP THE UTILITIES AND SELLING OFF IN PIECES IN A THAT MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF P. YOU SEE REVIEW. THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ENSURES THAT IF THAT OCCURS THAT THOSE SAME LABOR PROTECTIONS THAT I JUST DISCUSSED WOULD BE APPLIED SO THAT THERE BE SOME PROTECTION FOR THE WORKERS. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD -- ORIGIN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OFFICIALLY IN SUPPORT -- TWO THREE MINUTES OKAY. UP AND I'M NOTING THE OVERALL TIME OF PRESENTATION WILL. A REVITALIZATION FOR SIMILAR -- OPPORTUNITY. GOOD AFTERNOON HOURS JACKSON WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS IN MY OWN FAMILY STORIES TIED UP WITH THIS BILL MY GRANDFATHER WAS EVACUATED FROM THE CAMPFIRE AND THANKFULLY HIS LIFE WAS SPARED THAT DAY BUT I DO THINK IT MAY ACOSTA SPIRIT. HE DIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER IN AN ERROR BEING BI AND YUBA CITY. BUT I WANT TO ELIMINATE TODAY THE IMPACT. THIS BILL HAS ON A CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT I THINK IT'S LOST AMONG THE OTHER COMPETING VALID CONCERNS WITH THIS ISSUE. WE CANNOT MAKE GOOD ON OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS IF OUR MAJOR. INVESTORS IN CLEAN ENERGY ARE ON THE BRINK OF INSOLVENCY OR IN BANKRUPTCY. OR I FOR ASKING CUSTOMERS TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN. OF THESE COSTS. SO ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO FOCUS ON REDUCING THE UNDERLYING RISK AND THE UNDERLYING COSTS AND NOT JUST SOCIALIZE THEM MORE EQUITABLY. BUT WE NEED A BRIDGE TO GET THERE WE THINK THIS BILL GETS THE BALANCING ACT RIGHT IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PARADIGM SHIFT TO OCCUR. FOR THAT REASON WE ASK THE AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CHANCE MONEY JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT. TEN FIFTY FOUR A. AS HOPEFULLY STABILIZING THE FINANCIAL MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- MY MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE IT AND OTHERS HAVE INVESTED LITERALLY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE HERE MODERNIZE IN OUR FLEET RELIABILITY RESOURCES AND HEADED OVER TWENTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES -- THE GREAT PROGRESS MEETING THEIR GOALS AND AND OUR CARBON EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THAT NIGHT 30% LESS THAN THAT NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS HUGE SUCCESS. THAT'S ALL IN DANGER THE CONTRACTS THAT ARE A BIT A EXECUTE OUR IN OUR WITH THESE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN DANGER. P. GENIES IN BANKRUPTCY OTHER TO UTILITIES BORDERING ON JUNK BOND STATUS -- THAT HAS A REAL COST TO CALIFORNIA -- RATE PAYERS AND IT HAS A REAL COST TO GOING FORWARD I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THAT THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE INHERENT SAFETY QUESTIONS WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND WHAT PRUDENT -- MANAGER MEANS THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A SAFETY CERTIFICATE GIVEN -- ADDRESSING THAT FIRE LIABILITY WILL GO A LONG WAY I BELIEVE IN STABILIZING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND GAIN IS BACK ON TRACK WE CAN GENERALLY THIS IS A GOOD BILL. I WANT TO SAY THIS IS A GREAT TESTAMENT -- TO SORT OF BIPARTISAN WORK OF TRYING TO SOLVE -- AID A NUMBER OF INTER RELATED VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS AND I THINK THIS IS A GUY A GOOD EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IF THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- PERSONALLY I REPRESENTING CLICK A CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS. OUR TWEENER WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL -- THERE COUPLE COMMENTS I'D LIKE TO TO SHARE THE COMMITTEE OUT I'LL BE BRIEF ONE IS I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS RATES ARE GOING UP -- AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE UP WITHOUT THIS BILL -- AND SO THE STATUS QUO IS UNTENABLE AND SO I THINK A LOT OF CREDIT DOES NEED TO GO TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE AUTHORS OF THIS BILL -- TRYING TO MANAGE A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION. HOWEVER LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS THAT TAKE THEIR POWER A TRANSMISSION LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE EQUAL CENTS PER KILOWATT BASIS ALLOCATION OF THE COSTS OF THE SURCHARGE. WILL BEAR THE LARGEST BURDEN HAVE THE RATE INCREASE. AND SO WE THINK THERE ARE MANY COMMON SENSE APPROACHES THAT COULD BE DEALT WITH BY THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATORS IN GIVING US RATE RELIEF IN OTHER AREAS AND SO THIS IS WHERE THE BILL'S DEFICIENT. AND DOESN'T ALLOW US TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT WE LOOK FOR FOR THAT CONVERSATION MR HOLDEN I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WE LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUED CONVERSATION WITH MR MAYES MISS BURKE -- MOVING FORWARD SO THANK YOU FOR INDULGENCE. THANK YOU I JUST -- WE'RE GONNA. THIS IS FOR THOSE IN SUPPORT WIENER. WINNERS WILL HAVE A A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY -- WE'RE GONNA DO THE OPPOSITION AND THEN WINTERS IN A PROCEDURE TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WE FINISHED WITH SUPPORT. OKAY WILL HAVE THE TWO WINNERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND MICHAEL BOOKER ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION. LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHOR CO AUTHORS AND GOVERNOR STAFF FOR FINDING A SWEET SPOT IN A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT SITUATION. WELL WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL -- WE DO BELIEVE IT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER SB NINE A WANT FOR SHE'S MADE A YEAH SB NOT A ONE AND WILL LIMIT RATE PAYER IMPACTS AND HOPE THAT THE BILL MOVES TO THE GOVERNOR AND HIS PAST -- WE DO HAVE SOME HESITATION IS AND IT'S THE NEW SURCHARGE IS BEING CREATED AND AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM OUR LARGE INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS. AND JUST WE PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR SOME OF OUR LARGE FOOD PROCESSING CUSTOMERS. THE NEW SURCHARGE WILL ADD FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TO THEIR ELECTRICITY BILL. THAT SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS AND IF THAT WAS THE END OF IT. IT WOULD BE A GOOD CONVERSATION IT'S NOT WE'RE ALSO PAYING FORCE SYSTEM HARDENING WILD FIRE MITIGATIONCOSTS ARE GOING TO ADD LITERALLY. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO EACH OF THOSE COMPANIES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THOSE COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO BE COMPETITIVE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH MISS BURKE MR HOLDEN AND MISTER MAYES AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS. THAT THEY COULD EASILY BE THREE TO FIVE CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR ADDITIONALLY PARTICULAR IMPEACHING YOU SERVICE TERRITORY -- WE KNOW THE CO AUTHORS AND AUTHORS FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED ENSURE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY THE LOBBYIST FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- THERE ARE SOME AND NEW MUNICIPALITY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE LAST -- RECENT AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO GET THOSE CORRECTED AS WE MOVE pFORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIDGE THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE CHECK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CONGENERS AND GROWERS ASSOCIATION WESTRAC PROCESSORS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA DAIRY ZINC AMERICAN PISTACHIO GROWERS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. ALSO NEUTRAL ON THE BILL -- SHARING SOME OF THE CONCERNS -- THAT WERE SHARED BY THE OTHER WINNERS -- THAT NEW SURCHARGE EXPRESSLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AGRICULTURE AND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN OTHER AREAS THAT ARE IN THOSE HIGH FIRE RISKS AND HAVING TO PAY THOSE COSTS -- AND NOT BEING ABLE TO PASS ON THOSE COSTS TO CONSUMERS AS OTHERS MAY BE ABLE TO DO. AND EXPRESSLY WITH THOSE CONTINUAL RATE INCREASES THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THEIR ENERGY COSTS ARE GOING BUT AGAIN WE THINK THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING WITH US AND ALSO HAVING THAT DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO. TO LOWER RATES OR TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT -- TO OUR AGRICULTURAL PROCESSORS AND GROWERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE LEGACY OF FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE STATE'S. TRANSPORTATION FUEL SUPPLIERS REFINERS AND OIL PRODUCERS. ALSO HAPPEN TO BE SIMILAR TO THE LARGEST ENERGY USERS IN BOTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS THE UNIFICATION IMPACT IN RATES BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION WE'RE IN. WE KNOW WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. SO WE WANT TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE. WE WANT TO BE HELPFUL SO WE'RE TAKING A NEUTRAL POSITION BUT WE DO FEEL COMPELLED TO TELL YOU THAT WERE VERY VERY MUCH CONCERNED NOT. JUST ABOUT THE RATE THAT THE POTENTIAL OF EMERGENCY SHUT DOWNS THE ENERGY STATION. JUST AS WERE BEING TOLD TODAY THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT SIGNIFICANT RATE INCREASES WERE BEING NOTIFIED BY THE UTILITIES IN OUR REFINERIES AND ON OIL PRODUCTION FIELDS. THAT WE HAVE TO BRACE OURSELVES FOR EMERGENCY SHUTDOWNS. THAT'S AN UNTENABLE COMBINATION. ON RELIABLE POWER MORE EXPENSIVE POWER. SO AS YOU FINALIZE THIS PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION. AND HOPEFULLY PROVIDE MORE -- MORE SECURITY FOR THE UTILITIES AND FOR THE MARKETS WE HOPE YOU'LL TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE EMERGENCY SHUT DOWNS. AND HOW WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE WE LOOK FOR TO TALKING AND WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT THE BOOKSTORE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE POLICY ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO MANUFACTURERS OF ALL SIZES WE APPRECIATE EVERYONE TAKE A LOOK AT IT. BUT I DID WANT TO GET ON THE RECORD -- IS CMJ IS NEUTRAL IN THE LEGISLATION OVER VERY SUPPORT OF THE EFFORTS OF MR HOLDEN. MS BURKE IN MISTER MAYES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND ALL THE NATIONS THAT THEY'VE HAD WITH US MANUFACTURERS THROUGHOUT THE MANY MONTHS AND WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ON SUPPORT WE HAVE A A VICTIM AND NORTH A FIRE VICTIMS WHICH IS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS TO INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT. WELL THIRTY SECONDS PLEASE. AND LET'S STIPULATE YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE VICTIMS IN GENERAL. YES SIR PLEASE THIRTY SECONDS. MY NAME IS JOHN DEAVER'S WE LOST FAMILY THE NIGHT OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES SHE CALLED FROM TRAPPED WITHIN HER HOME. AND WE HAD TO LISTEN. HER LAST WORDS WERE I'M GOING TO DIE IN THAT SHE STARTED TO SCREAM AND THEN THE PHONE CALL CUT OFF. I TELL YOU THE STORY YES I ALSO WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND. THE VICTIMIZATION DID NOT END WITH THE EXTINGUISHING OF THE FLAMES. THEY CONTINUE THEY PERSIST AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES WHAT TEN FIFTY FOUR DOES HIS AT LEAST IT BEGINS THE START OF ADDRESSING THOSE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. IF I HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME HERE AND TELL YOU THE STORY I HOPE YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO VOTE FOR THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION NEXT PLEASE. OFFICIAL OPPOSITION PLEASE. TO THE TO THE DESK HERE AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY. TO GIVE YOU ANY AT SORT OF AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR TIME WE DON'T WANT TO GO IN EXCESS OF PROBABLY. EIGHT MINUTES TOTAL I THINK WE HAD ABOUT. EIGHT TO TEN WITH THE WITH THE ARE GOOD SUPPORT. AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA BE BE GENEROUS WITH THE CLOCK THANK YOU COULD I GET YOUR YOUR POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM PLAN. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. NO ONE HERE REALLY KNOWS WHO I AM. I AM A UC BERKELEY GRADUATE FROM LAW SCHOOL -- I'M A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR IN THE ORGANIZED CRIME FIELD. I WAS AN ASSISTANT COUNSEL TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS DOING OVERSIGHT. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE I BECAME AN ATTORNEY. FOR THE CUSTOMERS OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WHEN THEY ATTEMPTED TO RECOVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT. EXCEEDED WHAT THEY HAD I HAVE COVERED WITH YOUR INSURANCE IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FIRES. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT LITIGATION EVER SENSE. BUT WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT TRIED THE CASE. IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW. THAT S. TGT WAS NOT PRUDENT AND STARTING THE FIRES I'VE NEVER RECEIVED A PENNY AND NOT BEING PAID I HAVEN'T CHARGED FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT I HAVE. ATTEMPTED TO REPRESENT UTILITY CUSTOMERS I WILL BE BRIEF AND FOCUSED [inaudible] NUMBER. ONE THE CHANGE IN THE PERMANENCY ROLE. THE DISCUSSION ON THE PRUDENT TO ROLL I THINK HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT UNINFORMED BY ALL OF US. THE REAL CHANGE IS NOT ABOUT THE BURDEN OF PROOF. THE REAL CHANGE IS ABOUT WHETHER THE PRINCE WHO RULED. WILL BE PRUDENCE IN THE SENSE THAT THE UTILITY WAS PRUDENT WHEN THEY SETTLED THE CASE. AND THEREFORE THAT SATISFIES THE PRINCE TO RULE. OR WILL IT BE PRUDENCE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE ASSESSED IN WHETHER THEY WERE PRUDENT AND THE WAY THAT THEY MAINTAINED AND OPERATED THEIR SYSTEM. NOW YOU MIGHT THINK WELL YOU KNOW HOW COULD I MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT BUT OF CURRENTLY. WE ARE BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ALL THE UTILITIES ON THIS ISSUE OR BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. SDG AN A IN THEIR FILING ON PAGE EIGHT OF THEIR PETITION FOR CERT. SAID IN REFERRING TO FOR THAT FIRST HELD THAT RECOVERY. OF WILDFIRE COSTS. WAS WARRANTED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PRUDENCE OF ESTY GENIES MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS. THAT THE WORDS SDG NAY OF THE UTILITIES TAKE THE POSITION. THAT. GOOD NEWS AS TO HOW THEY WERE OPERATING FACILITIES. IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THEM TO SHOW. IN THE CURRENT BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT BILL SECTION. SIX AND YOU LOOK DOWN AND YOU READ. IT'S THE TALKS ABOUT ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS CONDUCT. NOW THE WORDS THE PRUDENCE EQUATION. FOCUSES ON THE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS CONDUCT IT DOESN'T SAY CONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS ROLE IN IGNITING THE FIRE AND IF YOU NOTICE AT ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE BILL. THEY TALK ABOUT IT NATION. BUT HERE THEY TALK ABOUT CONDUCT SO ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLARIFICATION IN THE BILL. NUMBER TWO YOU CAN NOT AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL EXTEND THE SURCHARGE WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED TO COVER. THE MANIPULATED PRICES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE THAT WAS THE CPUC PROCEEDING YOU CAN YOU CAN ENTITLE THE CPUC. TO START A PROCEEDING TO DO THE EXTENSION. BUT THE RATE PAYERS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS BECAUSE YOU'RE SETTING RATES. IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THEN THAT WOULD BE IN MY JUDGMENT TO BE CONSIDERED A TAKING. LAST POINT. ALL FOCUS SHOULD BE ON STOPPING THE WILD FIRES PERIOD. IF YOU READ THIS LOSS AND OR IF YOU READ THE WALL STREET JOURNAL TODAY. THERE'S A DEVASTATING FRONT PAGE STORY THAT MAKES THE CASE. THAT P. JEANNIE HAS KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME AND HAS IGNORED THE FACT. THAT THEIR POWER LINES ARE IN HORRIBLE SHAPE. THAT THEY ARE OUTMODED AND THEY NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED AT THE FRONT PAGE STORY IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. MY SUGGESTION. AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION. IS THAT YOUR COMMITTEE DEVELOP. VERY PRECISE FACTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT BREAKDOWNS IN THE MANAGEMENT AT THE UTILITIES. WHAT BREAKDOWN ACTUALLY RESULTED IN THE CAUSING OF FIRES? AND THAT YOU ADDRESS THOSE MANAGEMENT SHORTFALLS WITH VERY SPECIFIC. NEW RULES NUMBER TWO THE TO EXPAND THE EXISTING SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AT CEBU CITY THEY HAVE GREAT PEOPLE. IN SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AT CPUC. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE EXPANDED STATUS. THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY. YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE RULES. GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE IS A VERY PRECISE SET OF RULES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED PAINSTAKINGLY BY THE CPUC SINCE. NINETEEN THIRTEEN THEY ARE VERY PRECISE WHEN WE WHEN WE SHOW THAT SDG ESTY GINNY DID NOT. ACT PRUDENTLY WE DID THAT BY SHOWING THEY SPECIFICALLY VIOLATED PRECISE PROVISIONS OF GENERAL ORDER. NINETY FIVE WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW CLOSE HERE WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL. IS YOUR GIVING ALL THE INCENTIVES TO HAVE MORE WILD FIRES. MY ESTIMATED YOU'RE TALKING BETWEEN 200-252-20050 BILLION DOLLARS. OF MORE WILDFIRE COSTS WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BECOME AN OBLIGATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ROLLED INTO BONDS THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES WILL BE REQUIRED TO STAND BEHIND. AND THAT WILL BRING INTO QUESTION JUST LIKE IT DID BEFORE. THE CREDIT RATING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO MY SUGGESTION TO USE I THINK EVERYONE HERE IS WELL INTENDED. I THINK EVERYONE HERE IS TRYING HIS HARDEST A CAN GOVERNOR EVERYBODY ELSE. BUT I I I JUST ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR TEN YEARS. HAND TO HAND COMBAT WITH THESE FABULOUS UTILITIES AND THEIR FABULOUS LAWYERS. AND I'M TELLING YOU PLEASE DO NOT PASS THIS BILL PLEASE TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT YOUR APPROACH AND ASK THE GOVERNOR TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND START BY READING THE THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE IN THE PAPER TODAY. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOOK AND WE'LL GET TO ABOUT NINE OR TEN MINUTES I WANT TO BE AS FAIR AS I CAN FOR BOTH SIDES -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MY NAME IS WILLIAM ABRAMS -- I'M A WILDFIRE SURVIVOR FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR BIG WILD FIRES - I AM HERE TODAY TO ARGUE AGAINST MY SHORT TERM INTERESTS -- FOR THE LONGER TERM INTERESTS OF OUR STATE AND OUR CITIZENS -- WE RAN FROM THE FIRES WITH MY TWO YOUNG KIDS UNDER MY ARMS AND BY ALL MEANS I'M WITH MY COMMUNITY WHO IS IN NEED OF MONEY IN COMPENSATION TO HELP US ALONG THE RECOVERY PATH -- BUT AS THE FOLKS IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL SPOKE -- TO THAT THIS REALLY IS -- PROVIDING SOME MAJOR LEERAGE WITH P. JEANNIE. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE THERE'S SOME ALIGNMENT WITH THE FOLKS WHO NEED HELP NOW. LIKE ME. ALONG WITH THE UTILITY INTERESTS WHO WANT A LITTLE LESS REGULATION AND A LITTLE LESS ACCOUNTABILITY INTO THE FUTURE. AND UNFORTUNATELY I AM ALSO -- THE PARTY TO THE CPC PROCEEDINGS SO -- I HAVE SORT OF THAT PERSPECTIVE IN HADN'T I HAD THAT PERSPECTIVE. I WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THIS BILL. IN A VERY SHORT TIME THAT YOU OF ALL HAD TO CONSIDER IT. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN RUSHED ALONG WITH SOME OF THE LOBBYIST TO KNOCK ON MY DOOR TO SAY COME ON THIS IS GREAT FOR YOU I KNOW YOU NEED THE MONEY PLEASE LINE UP AND AND COLLECT. AND I WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT ALONG WITH THEM HOWEVER. THROUGH MY WORK AT THE SHEEP YOU SEE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S TRADE OFFS. SO RIGHT NOW IN THE CPUC. THERE ARE PROCEEDINGS THERE ARE PLANS THERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL BE PUSHED ASIDE TO MAKE ROOM FOR THIS BILL. HERE'S WHAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER NEITHER YOUR CONSTITUENTS. ARE YOU SITTING AT THE DESK TWO MINUTES. SOME HERE WE GO THANK AND THIS IS EXACTLY ISSUE THIS IS AND I I APPRECIATE I BELIEVE ME I APPRECIATE THE RUB HERE BUT THIS IS THE ISSUE IS THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO RUSH THROUGH A VERY IMPORTANT THINGS. THAT REQUIRE ANALYSIS WHAT I SUGGEST YOU DO IS HOLD UP. THE NEXT PHASE OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT ARE BEFORE THIS IF YOU SEE AND LOOK AT THESE PLANTS THROUGH THE BILL. LESS OVERSIGHT LESS ACCOUNTABILITY CURRENTLY WITH THE CPU SEE THEY'VE ALREADY GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF SAYING HEY WE NEED TO HAVE PERFORMANCE BASED METRICS. TIGHTER FINANCIALS. I WANT TO SUPPORT A CREDIT RATING FOR THE UTILITIES BUT THEY'VE GOT TO EARN IT. NOT THIS GIVEAWAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO ARTIFICIALLY PROP UP THEIR CREDIT RATING I WANT THEM TO WORK TO WORK TOWARDS IT BY MITIGATING FIRE RISKS. THIS PROVIDES THEM WITH THE ABILITY TO BACK AWAY FROM THEIR SAFETY. THIS PROVIDES THEM ABILITY TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME ON MITIGATION WE'VE GOT THIS FUND WHICH WILL RUN OUT IN ABOUT A SUMMER. AND THEN MORE OR WILL ALL OF US BE. AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS NONE OF US HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THIS HOLD UP WHAT'S PRESENT BY THE WAY. ALL THE SAFETY [inaudible] ORGANIZATIONS. BETTER BEFORE THE CPUC THAT HAVE BEEN IN THIS FIELD. FOR TEN PLUS YEARS. HAVE ALL SAID THAT THIS IS A BAD BILL. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT I TURN TO BECAUSE I'M NEW TO THIS AS OF OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN SO I TRIED TO DO MY DUE DILIGENCE AND REACH OUT TO ALL THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WHO KNEW MORE THAN I I'VE SPOKEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE AUTHORS. OF THIS BILL. I SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS. AND THEY DID NOT MAKE THOSE CALLS SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE AT THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT AT THE CPUC ASKED THEM YOU'RE ADDING THREE MORE LAYERS OF BUREAUCRACY. IS THAT A HELP TO YOU. HOW DOES THIS FIT IN TO ASK YOU SOME A PLEASE? ENTER IT DID MY EFFORT HERE IS TO BE FAIR FOR BOTH SIDES WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME ALLOTTED AYE AYE UNDER AND I AND AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH IT AND I UNDERSTAND HOW I'M DOING MY VERY BEST -- I'M WHAT I'M ASKING FOR SUMMATION ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS THIRTY SECONDS CLOSE THIRTY SECOND SUMMATION THERE ARE LOOPHOLES THAT THE ATTORNEYS WILL DRIVE TRUCKS THROUGH TO GET THIS THROUGH. THERE'S ALL SORTS OF REGULATIONS THAT DON'T BELONG HERE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ALL OF YOU AND ON ME. TO SUPPORT THIS. I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS SURGERY NOT TO SUPPORT THIS. I KNOW I'M A DEMOCRAT I WANT TO GET BEHIND IT. I FULLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR AND ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS BUT THIS IS NOT IT THIS PUT YOUR ALL IN JEOPARDY FOR THE LONG TERM FOR SHORT TERM PAY OUTS. AND SHORT TERM. THINGS TO HOLD UP THE I. O. U.'S IN GET THEM DISINCENTIVE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU PUSH IT UP. OTHERS HERE YET THAT WANT TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION -- PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. I AGREE WITH THE LAST SPEAKER I WAS KEPT THINKING MA'AM I HAVE -- TO KAREN PERKINS I'M CENTER AND AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. MY PRISON NO MORE I OPPOSE OPPOSE THE BILL. AND I OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE THE VAST FORTY MILLION AFTER ALL I HAVE TO ARE NOT HERE. AND AND THIS IS BEING RUSHED THROUGH ITS BEING RUSHED THROUGH SAM ASKED AND IT WILL BE ALL PRIVATIZING PROFITS AND SOCIALISING LOSSES WITH. NO INCENTIVE WHATSOEVER FOR THEM TO CHECK THEIR POWER LIGHT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THESE ARE RULES OF THE COMMITTEE. THEY ARE EMINENTLY FAIR AND WE ASK FOR THOSE TO PARTICIPATE WITH IN THOSE RULES THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. SEEING NONE WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT UP -- BACK GUY HERE -- I WHAT BUT DO WE HAVE I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY. FOR QUESTIONS THE AT SOME POINT I'M GONNA WANT TO ASK -- FOR SOME RESPONSES -- WITH REGARD TO WHAT TESTIMONY WE'VE HEARD IF MEMBERS WANT TO QUESTION THAT. AND OPEN THAT UP I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE LET'S LET'S OPEN THIS TO TO MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS. OUR WHO FIRST. THE NEW ARMS CUNNINGHAM THAN MR MESSAGES. SO I THANK YOU ALLALL THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN A MONTHS LONG PROCESS OF DELIBERATION STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. AS I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC DOMAIN I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS IT PROTECTS THE WORKERS WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. I THINK IT STABILIZES THE I. O. U.'S WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO AT THIS POINT -- AND THIS JUNCTURE AND WE'RE ALL TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION THAT NONE OF US. BECAUSE THEN I THINK THIS IS A VALIANT EFFORT I WANTED TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON AND AND GET THE AUTHORS. RESPONSES ON SOME POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WITH RESPECT -- TO THE WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE PRUDENT MANAGER STANDARD AND HOW THAT WORKS WITH THE BILL BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. FINALLY WE HAVE A BIG INCENTIVE PROBLEM WITH THE I'VE USE BECAUSE OF WEATHER AND I WOULD. PASCAL LOOKED THE WALL STREET JOURNAL A EITHER YESTERDAY OR TODAY THAT SAID PEACHY NEEDS. UNDER INVESTED IN SAFETY. IN A BIG WAY AND THAT'S THE WALLSTREET JOURNAL. OKAY SO WHEN THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HAPPENING AND AND COULD TAKE LIVES AND PROPERTY IN COST US ALL. COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THOSE THOSE IMMEDIATELY PUSHED I OWE YOU ANY GIVEN I'LL YOU P. JEANNIE OR ANYBODY. IN THE INSOLVENCY. SO WE'VE GOT TO CREATE A PATH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE INCENTIVIZE TO INVEST IN HARDENING THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES THAT AND I THINK THE WAY IT DOES IT. IS BY SAYING THAT. YOU HAVE TO GET A SAFETY CERTIFICATION AND THEN YOU HAVE A PRESUMPTION THAT COULD PRESUMPTION CAN BE OVERCOME -- THROUGH THE PROCEEDINGS BUT YOU HAVE A PRESUMPTION. SO IT IT CREATES AN INCENTIVE STRUCTURE IN A FUNDING MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THE I USE ARE INVESTING IN SAFETY FIRST AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR INTERNAL CULTURES. SO THAT THEY TAKE A SAFETY FIRST MENTALITY AND OUT HOW THEY ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE BILL. I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF THE AUTHORS OF LIKE TO EXPOUND UPON -- I WOULD START WITH YES THOSE THOSE THINGS ARE IN PLACE AND THERE'S A CERTIFICATION IN PLACE BUT THERE IS ALSO BEFORE THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AGGREGATE THAT HAS TO GO TO INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE SAFETY MEDICATION IS GONNA REMIND QUICKLY THROUGH THE CHAIR. THROUGH THE CHAIRS. ACCORDING TO THE RULES THROUGH THE CHAIR. WHAT I JUST SAID -- AND ON THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN. OR PROFIT FROM THAT INVESTMENT SO I MEAN THAT'S AN INITIAL HARDENING -- OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FIRE SAFETY THAT STARTS THAT IS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FUND AT ALL -- AND THEN YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR YEARLY CERTIFICATIONS AND I WOULD SAY TO THE OPPOSITION AS WELL AS IS. THIS YEAR THE CPUC HAS DONE THE BEST THEY CAN HOWEVER ON THE NEW BOARD AND DIVISIONS WILL HAVE FIRE EXPERTS PEOPLE THAT HAVE OVER THE YEARS. BUILT IN EXPERTISE IN FIRE MANAGEMENT EMPIRE SAFETY WITH UTILITIES I THINK THAT EXPERTISE IS VERY IMPORTANT AND BECAUSE IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE A PC THERE WILL BE MORE NIMBLE TO ALL NEW. NEW SITUATIONS THAT ARISE AND ADJUSTING THE WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR THOSE CERTIFICATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS AT THE HEIGHT OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WISE MAY I PLEASE RESPOND. WE ARE UP IN THE MEMBER UP. TO HIS QUESTION THAT'S ALL I KNOW I DID MEMBERS ARE NOW -- ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS OTHER MEMBERS MAY WANT TO OPEN UP THE DISCARDED AND REALIZED THAT HE WAS ONLY ASKING ONE SIDE. QUESTION NOT THAT OKAY PLEASE ONE SEC ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA HAVE TO JUST LOOK THIS IS THROUGH THE CHAIR OKAY I AND IT'S WHICH BUT WITH RESPECT. TO THE PRACTICED RULES OF ENGAGEMENT OKAY HERE AND WE ARE NOW AT A POINT WHERE MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONING AND THEY WILL CONTROL WHO THEY TALKED TO IN THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY ASK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS -- FOR MS MOTORCYCLES STANDING THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE LARGELY THROUGH THE WORK OF A ATTORNEYS WITH O'MELVENY MYERS AND GOVERNMENT GUGGENHEIM INVESTORS -- BASICALLY WROTE THIS BILL WITH. THE ADMINISTRATION WITH OUR VISORS WORK CLOSELY WITH -- THE AUTHORS OF LEGISLATIVE STUFF AND DEVELOPING THAT LEGISLATION I WAS TOLD THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SENT LANGUAGE. TO THE AUTHORS ON FRIDAY LESSON TWO WEEKS AGO IS THAT CORRECT. IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I THINK WAS WHEN THE FINAL BUT WHEN THE FINAL LANGUAGE -- WAS SUBMITTED UP STAIRS AND THEN SUBSEQUENT WORK -- WAS -- WAS DONE TO IT BUT REVISE IT WELL SURE IT WAS EXACTLY ON FRIDAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHEN IT WENT TO PRINCE A FEW DAYS BEFORE. MR HOLDEN WAS IT FRIDAY LESSON TWO WEEKS AGO THEY RECEIVE THE LANGUAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WE RECEIVE THE LANGUAGE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HELLO ALL ALONG -- AND ONCE WE RECEIVE THE OF WE BEGAN. CONVERSATIONS AROUND ELEMENTS OF THE BILL THAT WE THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE -- SIMPLE IDEAS THAT WE THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE TO INTEGRATE INTO IT YES SORRY. YEAH I'M I HAD A CHANCE -- TO TO READ THE EDITORIALS OF THE LOS ANGELES TIMES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE. THE LA TIMES OP ED ON THIS BILL IS. CALIFORNIA RACING TO PASS A BADLY VETTED WHAT FAR BILL -- THAT -- THAT WERE BEING. THAT THIS BILL [inaudible] I'D. SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PASS THIS WEEK. THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE ON EDITORIAL IT TALKS ABOUT. A QUOTE HERE THEY'RE CONCLUDING STATEMENT IT'S MORE PORT TO GET AB TEN FIFTY FOUR RIGHT THAN TO GET A PASSED QUICKLY THE STATE ASSEMBLY MUST RESIST THE PRESSURE AND STOP GIVING THIS BILL A FAST RUN TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. SO. MY QUESTION BACK TO MS MODEST SANTOS IS. WHY THE RUSH -- TO PASSES BILL IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. THIS LEGISLATION IS THE WORK OF CONSIDERABLE WORK BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE IT BUILDS ON SB NINE A ONE FROM LAST YEAR IT REFLECTS THE WORK OF THE STRIKE FORCE THAT -- THE WHAT WHERE THE REPORT WAS RELEASED A FEW THAT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IT REFLECTS THE WORK OF THE SB NINE A ONE COMMISSION. THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS HOW TO POP SAID A PUBLIC HEARINGS ARE WORKING ON EXTENSIVE -- INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS THIS IS. WE THE THERE'S THERE'S CHALLENGE TO TAKE ACTION TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA WE ARE LOOKING AT IT THE CURRENT SITUATION WHERE THE RATE PAID EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH. A POTENTIAL DOWNGRADES WITH POTENTIAL BANKRUPTCY WITH GREATER INSTABILITY -- IS IS GREAT AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK A LOT OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION MANY PUBLIC HEARINGS ABOUT DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT HAS HAVE LED TO TO TO THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU -- ACTION IS IS CRITICAL TO GET TO A PLACE OF BOTH PROVIDING -- A MECHANISM FOR RELIEF FOR VICTIMS -- PROVIDING IMPORTANT RATE PAYER PROTECTIONS IN AVOIDING A HIGHER BORROWING COSTS -- HIGHER COST RECOVERY ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT LAW AND AND GETTING TO A PATH WHERE WE CAN YOU KNOW GET THE GET THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED TO OCCUR. RELATIVE TO SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY INTO PLACE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND I APPRECIATE. TO MS MONSANTO'S SWEET WE HAD A CHANCE. TO TO AND MEET WITH YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF YESTERDAY -- TO TAKEN. A DEEPER DIVE IN INTO THE BILL I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS. YOU KNOW A LOT OF GOOD IN THIS BILL AND AND I YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL I I I WANT -- TO RESPECT ALL THE VICTIMS HERE AND IN THE AUDIENCE -- AS WELL AS OUT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE -- YOU KNOW AND I I I REALIZE THAT -- THIS. IS PRETTY HEAVY STUFF THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SUCH HEAVY STUFF THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. I AM I AM CONCERNED THAT WERE WERE -- RUSHING THIS THROUGH WITH MANY MEMBERS NOT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON HERE -- ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS -- HIGHLIGHTED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE EDITORIAL THAT -- THAT -- ACCORDING TO BE. EDITORIAL THE WATCHFIRE DAMAGES FUND CREATED BY A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR INCLUDES A CAP. ON REIMBURSEMENTS FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE FOUND HAVE ACTED UNREASONABLY TO HAVE STARTED A FIRE. IS THAT ACCURATE MS MONSANTO'S. I I BELIEVE THAT IS NOT FULLY CAPTURING THE STRUCTURE THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE INCLUDING THE FACT THAT FOR EXAMPLE SO IT'S REFERRING I BELIEVE TO THE DEDUCTIBLE ELEMENT OF THE OF THE MEASURE AND TAKING THAT PIECE IN ISOLATION AND NOT LOOKING AT THE WAY IN WHICH THAT. DEDUCTIBLE GOES AWAY IF AN ENTITY DOES NOT HAVE -- DOES NOT HAVE A SAFETY CERTIFICATION AND IF AN ENTITY -- IS WILLFULLY ACTING IN A WAY THAT -- THAT IS CAUSING THE THE BEHAVIOR UNDER BOTH OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE ENTITY WOULD HAVE TO RE REIMBURSE THE FUN FOR A 100% OF THE COST. SO IF WE STEP BACK AND WE KIND OF LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT -- MISS BURKE SPOKE TO AND RELATIVE TO TO HOW THE THE BILL THE STRUCTURE. FRONT AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ANNUAL PLANS THOSE ANNUAL PLANTS REQUIRE PROGRESS REPORTS THOSE PROGRESS RICK BUT REPORTS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY FIELD EVALUATIONS -- SO ACTUAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND VERIFYING THE UTILITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO FULL ENFORCEMENT ACTION INITIALLY WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE SUBSEQUENTLY WITHIN THE STANDALONE DEPARTMENT THAT IS GOING TO BE SOLELY FOCUSED ON ON THE THE YOU KNOW THE SAFETY OF OUR ELECTRICITY. TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE -- THOSE THAT DOES CERTIFICATION HAS TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER FOR A UTILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE FUND. THE UTILITIES ALSO ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PRE FUND TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF OF OF FUNDING INTO THAT FUND TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES IN THE CASE OF UTILITY COSTS WILDFIRES. THAT IF THAT FUND THAT TEN AND A HALF BILLION COMES WITH A DEDUCTIBLE. THAT DEDUCTIBLE THOUGH VERY SPACED ON REPAIR I'M SORRY ON UTILITY BEHAVIOR IF THE UTILITIES ACT PRUDENTLY THEN THE FUND WOULD PAY THE CLAIMS THE UTILITIES DON'T HAVE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS. IF THE UTILITIES DON'T DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BUT ACT BUT BUT DO HAVE A VALID CERTIFICATE ENACT WITHIN REASON. THEY WOULD HAVE. A DEDUCTIBLE THAT DEDUCTIBLE WOULD BURY THEIR TOTAL EXPOSURE ON THE THAT DEDUCTIBLE IS THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ANOTHER THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE UTILITIES WOULD HAVE TO FUND WITHOUT RECOVERY. WITHOUT ANY COST RECOVERY FOR RATEPAYERS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES AS WELL IF THE UTILITIES HOWEVER DON'T HAVE A VALID CERTIFICATE OR DELL OR ACT WILLFULLY -- OR NEGLIGENT OR WILFUL IN THEIR IN THEIR NEGLIGENCE ACTION THEY WOULD HAVE TO REIMBURSE THE PHONE FOR A 100% OF THE COST SO I THINK. THAT THAT PIECE IS AN IS IS AN ELEMENT BUT IT'S THE THE THE EDITORIAL IS MISSING THE OTHER TWO COMPONENTS UNDER WHICH THAT CAP ACTUALLY GOES AWAY AND IS NOT AVAILABLE TO A UTILITY THAT IS NOT ACTING RESPONSIBLY ALL RIGHT AND AND AND SO -- I I BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS WHAT YOU INDICATED EXPLAIN NOW IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO I IS IT DIDN'T THAT THAT SENSES CHRONICLE STATEMENT DIDN'T SOUND. ACCURATE AND I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BUT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT RATE PAYERS ARE PROTECTED -- YEAH I I I EGGS MY MET WITH TURN YESTERDAY AND AND AND THEY TOLD ME THAT. THEY ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE THERE'S A CAP AND A CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH RATE PAYERS. WOULD PAY ARE AND AND THAT WOULD% BE THE TEN POINT FIVE BILLION -- THAT THAT THAT -- WE WOULD BE COMING FROM THE D. W. R. FEES YES FROM A FROM -- DRAPER PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS -- IN IN THE MEASURE SO THE MEASURE AUTHORIZES THE PEW SEEK TO ADOPT THE EXTENSION OF THE THE W. ALREADY TRUCK WHICH IS CHARGING FOLKS ARE PAYING TODAY. IT WOULD BE CAPS TO TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS THE RATE PAYER EXPOSURE UNDER THE MEASURE. WHILE THE FUND IS IN EFFECT IN THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN PLACE WE'VE MODELED AND WE BELIEVE THE FUND WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND THAT IS WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE UTILITIES MAY HAVE TO MAKE BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIOR -- SO THAT'S THE AND THE THE OTHER PIECES THERE'S A RATE PAYER US SAVING SO UNDER. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE REQUIRED INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MISS BURKE SPOKE TO RELATIVE TO THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. UTILITIES UNDER CURRENT LAW WOULD BE ABLE OR AT A RATE OF RETURN ON THAT SO THAT THAT CAN RANGE YOU KNOW BETWEEN YOU KNOW. ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE THOSE LIMITS THIS WOULD TAKE THOSE DOLLARS TO ZERO THAT'S TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF REPAIR SAVINGS UNDER THIS MEASURE COMPARED TO CURRENT LAW OKAY. BUT BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE QUALIFIER THAT YOU PUT INTO -- AND IN IN YOUR SEAT YEAH I WANT TO RESPECT ALL OF THE MEMBERS AND THEIR TIME FOR QUESTIONING BUT I HAVE THREE OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE WAITING TO YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CHAMP. SO -- YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE QUALIFIER THAT YOU YOU INDICATED IS THAT THE IS THAT THE CAP IN THE CERTAINTY WOULD BE APPLY WHILE THE FUND IS IN EFFECT IS THAT CORRECT. WHILE WHILE THE FUND HAS CLAIMS BEING RESOURCES THE TEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IS THE IS THE AMOUNT AND WE BELIEVE THE FUNDS WILL BE. IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS COULD BE LONGER ALL RIGHT BUT THE AT THE YOUR YOUR PROJECTION IS IS THAT THIS FUND WOULD BE. A FORTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND -- THAT THAT -- IS PROJECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR TEN DO UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES THAT WOULD PROVIDE -- THE PROVIDE -- COUPLE COVERED BETWEEN AT LEAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. IT COULD BE LARGER SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU TELL THESE ARE BAR HAVING TO PAY ADDITIONAL DEDUCTIBLES. THAT WOULD BE MORE MONEY INTO THE FUND LONGER TIME PERIOD FOR CLAIMS FAMILIES ALL RIGHT BUT WE WE WE JUST HEARD. TO THE MATH THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE. A TESTIFIED THAT TEN OF THE LAST. NO THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE A WILD FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST. FOR YEARS HAVE LIFE SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND AND IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE IS THE FIGURE THAT THE DAMAGES JUST FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS ESTIMATED TO BE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND IT'S SO SO IT IT IT IT SEEMS CLEAR -- JUST FROM THE HISTORY THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE AND NOW IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE WE ALREADY SUFFERED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. I DON'T FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THIS FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO LAST AS LONG AS YOU'RE YOU'RE REPRESENTING. IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE WEAKENING THE PRUDENT MANAGEMENT STANDARD THAT WILL ALLOW. YOU KNOW THE COST TO BE PASSED ON TO RATE PAYERS AT AT AT A LOWER STANDARD [inaudible] MY CONCERN. IS THAT THIS IS. READING IT'S OPENING THE WINDOW FOR RATE PAYERS DIFFERENT FURTHER BE SETTLED BY -- THE EVER INCREASING WATER PARK US THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MISTER MURATSUCHI -- QUIRK. YES EGGMAN AND THEN WAS REYES SAID RESPOND TO SOME OF MISTER MAYOR SU CHI'S CONCERN. IF WE WERE DOING THINGS THE SAME WAY WE'VE DONE THEM FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THAT FUND WOULD NOT LAST VERY LONG THE TWENTY ONE BILLION. WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT WE ARE TURNING OFF THE POWER TO THE LINES ON A REGULAR BASIS. ANY TIME THERE CONDITIONS THAT WE KNOW WILL CAUSE A WILDFIRE. OF THE TYPE THAT TO CURD -- THE CAMPFIRE IT CETERA WE OF HIGH WINDS LOW HUMIDITY HIGH TEMPERATURES THE LINES ARE JUST GETTING TURNED OFF. MISTER GALLAGHER WHO HAS SEEN MOST OF THESE CAN TELL YOU HOW DISRUPTIVE THAT IS. THE OTHER THING IS THEY'RE ASKING FOR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM. AND THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BEST WAY TO SPEND IT IS BUT FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY'RE LOOKING AT IF A WIRE BREAKS THAT THEY THEN. TURN OFF THE THE POWER TO THAT WIRE INTERMITTENT THERE. THERE ARE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE I CAN'T TELL YOU WHICH ONES. BUT THIS YOU'RE RIGHT IF WE DID THINGS THE WAY WE'VE DONE THEM FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THIS FUND WOULD NOT LAST. THE PEOPLE WHO LOOKED AT THIS LOOKED AT IT TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS NEEDED IF WE WENT WITH THE NEW PROCEDURES. I WILL SAY THAT. THE OTHER THING THEY'VE DONE IS WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT ADDISON IN PARTICULAR -- BUT TO SOME EXTENT SEMPRA. FROM GOING INTO JUNK BOND STATUS ARE ONCE THAT HAPPENS THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF THEM GOING INTO THE SAME BANKRUPTCY AT WHICH POINT. THE FED COURT TAKES OVER AND WE HAVE VERY LITTLE -- LEVERAGE ONE OF THE POINTS OF THIS BILL IS TO GET P. GENIE OUT OF BANKRUPTCY QUICKLY THEY CAN ONLY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS FUND. IF THEY CAN GET OUT QUICKLY AND PART OF THAT IS SETTLING THEIR CURRENT -- CLAIMS -- THE OTHER THING SO THAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS I'LL ALSO SAY THAT I DOUBT THAT ANYONE AT THE CHRONICLE A REALLY READ THE HUNDRED PAGES AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- LAST YEAR I PUT OUT A BILL PRIOR TO NINE NO. ONE AND IT SAID QUIRK IS DOING A BAILOUT WELL IF YOU READ MY BILL IT SAID YES THE CUSTOMERS WILL. PAY OFF. OF THE THE CLAIMANTS BUT ALL OF THAT MONEY WOULD THEN BE REIMBURSED BY THE UNDERSTOOD UTILITY. NONE THE LESS EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS A 100% REIMBURSEMENT TO THE CUSTOMERS WHO WAS CALLED TO BAIL OUT -- I JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF BECAUSE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT NAOMI BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED -- FINALLY -- THERE'S ONE OTHER ISSUE YOU BROUGHT UP AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS IT WAS WITH ME A SECOND AGO. THE MANAGEMENT AND WELL ON THE MANAGEMENT STANDARD SO -- THE I KNOW WHAT IT IS SO WHAT DID WE DO ASK BEING CONSULTED BY THE GOVERNOR. THE FIRST THING IS THE NOT YOU RECALL BECAUSE YOU WERE HERE THE NINE NO WIND COMMISSION SUGGESTED THAT WE GET RID OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE AUTHORS TOLD -- THE GOVERNOR THAT WAS A NO GO -- THERE ARE OTHER -- EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT WERE IN THERE THE COMMISSION ALSO SAID THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE PURE. FOR BURKE STANDARD WHAT IN FACT WE'VE DONE IS YES SO THE CURRENT STANDARD IS GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT. THE FIRST STANDARD IS INNOCENT TILL PROVEN GUILTY. IF YOU'VE AND BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS IN FACT IN THIS BILL WHICH IN THIS BILL IS. UP FOR THERE TO BE IN A PRESUMPTION THAT YOU ARE A GOOD PLAYER YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ACCEPTED WILDFIRE -- PLAN AND YOU HAVE TO BEEN DOING THE WORK. AND IF SOMEONE CAN SHOW THAT IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T -- DONE THE THINGS YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THEN THE PRESUMPTION GOES BACK TO GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT SO IT'S NOT AT ALL. WHAT WAS SUGGESTED IN THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION OR FRANKLY WITH THE GOVERNOR WANTED? THE FINAL I'D LIKE TO BRING UP ONE SEPARATE ISSUE. SO THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ALSO GETTING THIS FROM A COUPLE OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE SAID THAT. THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TAKE OVER THE PGA ANY LINES. NOW AS I READ THE BILL AS A LABOR PROTECTION ITEM. IT SAYS ANY TAKEOVER BY A NOTHER -- ENTITY OF SAY P. JEANNIE LINES OR FOR THAT MATTER ADD THIS IN SEPARATE CETERA. ANY TAKEOVER OF THAT TYPE MUST GO THROUGH THE P. YOU SEE PROCESS. THAT IS A WAY OF PROTECTING RATE PAYERS AND A WAY OF PROTECTING LABOR SO THAT PEOPLE KEEP THEIR SENIORITY -- THEY'LL STILL GET THEIR VACATION PAY THEY WON'T HAVE THEIR PAY -- KEEP THEIR VACATION TIME THEY WON'T HAVE THEIR PAY REDUCED IT CETERA THOSE ARE LABOR NOW THAT DOES TAKE LONGER. THAN THE ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS TO DO EMINENT DOMAIN. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN ENTITY ACT ACT COUNTY OR CITY. TO DO EMINENT DOMAIN AND TAKE OVER THOSE WIRES -- THAT'S WHAT'S TRYING TO BE PREVENTED BY THIS PALE. BY GOING THROUGH THE P. YOU SEEK. PROCESS WE PROTECT RATE PAYERS WE PROTECT FURTHER OF POSSIBLE VICTIMS AND WE PROTECT LABOR. SO -- IF ANYONE WANTS TO RESPOND TO THAT CONCERN AND I KNOW -- BUT WE HEARD FROM -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU HIS CONCERNS ABOUT IT IF ONE OF THE EXPERTS WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS. BY WHICH SAN FRANCISCO OR SOME OTHER ENTITY COULD TAKE OVER PART OF THAT. I OWE YOU SYSTEM I'D BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT. THE LABOR PROVISIONS. A LIST OF WHAT WE CAN. DO YOU CAN OR WE CAN HAVE. A BUSINESS WHERE CHAIR IN THE PROCESS I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. A MOTION AND A SECOND -- HAVING BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF A VERY GRACIOUS CHAIR TO CUT MY OWN REMARKS SHORT IN TIMES PAST. I'M JUST GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE DO HAVE WERE UP AGAINST SOME DEGREE OF TIME NOT THAT I WANT TO RUSH IT. I'M NOT I I'M GONNA GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE QUESTION WHO WITH WHOMEVER THEY THEY WANT. TO WE HAVE A SERIES OF THOSE WHO'VE BEEN RECOGNIZED SO WE'RE GONNA GO WITH MS MS EGGMAN AND THEN MS REYES. THANK YOU AND I AND MR PART OF MY QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH THAT LAST PART OF MISTER QUIRK SO I THOUGHT I THOUGHT FOR TIME. FOR TIME ISSUES WE COULD DO THIS -- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION -- AND AS WE SAY. IN IN MY OFFICE WE IN CALIFORNIA VERY GLAD THAT I'M A SCIENTIST IS ON OUR SIDE -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO I THINK EVERYBODY FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS. AND I'M NOT A PROSECUTOR SCIENTIST LIKE MR QUIRK I'M JUST AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER TRYING TO REPRESENT MY COMMUNITY -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO ASK ABOUT IS VERY ISSUE THAT MR QUIRK REYES AT THE END ABOUT THE MUNY SNOW AND I UNDERSTAND. NO MISTER. WHAT'S GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT WE DON'T WANT TO HEDGE FUND BUYING OFF PARTS AND AND JUST. NO NOBODY WANTS THAT RIGHT NOBODY WANTS THAT AND I BUT I AM PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO STABILIZE EVERYTHING -- BUT THEY'RE ALL I MEAN I THINK WE ALSO NEED. TO PROVIDE SPACE IF THERE ARE. VIABLE OTHER PROJECTS OUT THERE IN MY DISTRICT SINCE IT FOR CLOSE TO MY DISTRICT SINCE. THE BEGINNING OF THE OF TWO THOUSANDS SOUTH TELECOMMUNICATION DISTRICT HAS BEEN TRYING TO TAKE OVER PART OF THE P. JEAN AREA AND HAS BEEN A LONG AN ONGOING FIGHT AND THEY ARE UNION SHOP. THEY ARE AND I B. W. SHOT. AND SO THEIR ISSUES ARE ARE NOT AROUND THE EMPLOYEES BUT ITS AROUND THE EXTRA WHO THEN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THERE ALREADY IN IN MY DOMAIN AND THEN TO THE PC. SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE REAL ISSUES. I CAN TELL YOU I WAS AT A AND ALSO SPEAK TO THE ISSUES UP AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS LIKE MISTER PATTERSON AGRICULTURAL. A DISTRICT IN THE VALLEY. RIGHT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXTENDING THAT THAT FEE IT IS HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE VALLEY AREAS AND AS AS SOME OF MY MY FRIENDS WILL SAY WE DUG A CULTURE WE SERVE AS A FIRE. A BUFFER RIGHT BIG WILD FIRES ARE NOT GONNA OCCUR WHERE THERE IS MANAGE AGRICULTURE GOING ON USE MORE POWER IN PROCESSING -- HAVE LESS CHANCES OF WILDFIRES BUT OUR CLUSTER HIGHER. SO THAT'S I MEAN JUST ON ITS FACE VALUE THAT IS IN IN EQUITY THAT I THINK NEEDS PROPPED ON IN THIS BILL. BUT A TENSION GOING FORWARD. AND THEN -- I WAS AT THE END BECAUSE WE HAVE. THE POWER LINES COMING OUT OF THIS YEAR IS INTO THE BAY AREA IN OTHER PLACES. GOING OVER PART OF THE VITAMIN TAKE AREA THERE ARE POWER LINES SO EVERYONE'S GETTING NOTICES NOW THAT THEIR POWER WE MIGHT BE POWERED OFF. SO THE SAME TIME YOU'RE TELLING FOLKS NEEDS SALT SORRY SOUTH SOMEONE CAN YOUR GEISHA DISTRICT YOU CAN'T BECAUSE WE HAVE TO THE P. JEANNIE DO ITP. GENIUS AND WE'RE GONNA POWER OFF -- AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND I HAVE RELATIVES IN THE PARADISE AREA I HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN TO THE WILDFIRES I AM A LONGTIME LOVER THIS YEAR'S. BUT I HAD A GENTLEMAN IN MANTECA. MORNING ME TO GUARANTEE HIM. THE P. GINNY WAS GOING TO PAY FOR HIS MEAT IN HIS FREEZER IF THEY HAD A TURN OFF THE POWER FOR TWO DAYS. RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS BIG GRID STABILIZATION YOU HAVE PEOPLE AS THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES. RIGHT SO WE THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET IT RIGHT AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. AND SO ONE OF THE THING I WANT TO ASK DO YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION IT'S ALSO ABOUT. A YOU CAN'T BE CERTIFIED IF YOU HAVE DONE MASSIVE PAYOUTS FOR YOUR EXECUTIVES COULD YOU ALSO SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN. IS IT WILL THERE BE SOME ADJUSTMENT GOING FORWARD ON THAT -- OTHER ENTITIES WANTING TO TAKE OVER A PIECE IF IT MAKES SENSE. FOR THE COMMUNITY AND FOR EVERYBODY SURROUNDING IT AND THEN AND AGAIN ABOUT THAT. THAT FEED THAT IS GOING TO BE LARGER IN MY DISTRICT AND IT'S GOING TO BE IN MISTER QUIRK OR MISTER MERCY JUST DISTRICT. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO USE MORE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S HOTTER AND WE USED. I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. I THINK WE MIGHT ALL WANT TO BUT BUT MAYBE WE CAN JUST HAVE -- THE SMALLER SALAS KIND OF CAPTURE OKAY SOME OF THE BIG BOYS WILL FOLLOW PLEASE. IF I MAY ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF THE YOU KNOW P. JEANNIE DISPOSITION OF P. JEANNIE. PROPERTIES WHAT IS THE FUTURE P. JEANNIE LOOK LIKE IT CETERA YOU KNOW ALL THE ALL THE QUESTIONS OF REORGANIZATION OF P. JEANNIE -- THE MATTERS OF DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. SO -- ALL THE QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT IS THE THE THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION THAT WILL BE APPROVED BY -- BY THE COURT IS IN AND ALL OF THE QUESTIONS RELATIVE TO THE PROPERTY GIVEN THE FACT THAT P. GENIE IS THE ENTITY IN BANKRUPTCY ALL THOSE ISSUES. ARE PART OF THE SCOPE OF WHAT THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WILL BE WORKING THROUGH WHAT THE MET ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE MEASURE SAYS ON THAT POINT OF THE EQUATION IS IT SAYS. THAT BANKRUPTCY THE TERMS OF THE BANKRUPTCY IT HAS TO BE THERE HAS TO BE -- REPAIR NEUTRAL IT HAS TO PAY THE VICTIMS OF THE TERM BY THE COURT IN FULL. ON THE TIME OF SPECIFIED BY THE COURT IT HAS TO PROVIDE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS AND RIVER INCLUDING OUR PS AND OTHER ELEMENTS. AND THE THE PC HAS -- TO HAS TO CERTIFY THAT THE THE IT THAT THE PC HAS TO CERTIFY. THAT THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION CONSIDERS THE CONTRIBUTION FROM RATEPAYERS INAPPROPRIATE USHER INCLUDE POTENTIAL VALUE SHARING SO THE THE ACTUAL DETAILED P. JEANNIE PROPERTY REORGANIZATION QUESTIONS AT CENTER OF THOSE ARE MATTERS BEFORE THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IN TERMS OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE PROTECTION OF THE IN THE BILL AS YOU MENTIONED. THE MANY OF THESE WORKER PROTECTIONS WERE IN PLACE IN SB NINE OH ONE AND ARE PART OF ARE PART OF CURRENT LAW TO GET EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIS IS THE MUNICIPAL STATION PROCESS -- YOU KNOW THAT THE STATUTE RELATIVE TO HELP IN THIS POSITION WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD REMAINS IN PLACE. FOR FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WHAT THIS SAYS IT IN THE INTO THE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS TO THE WORKERS. THAT -- AND THAT IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE WORKERS THEMSELVES FOR THEIR BENEFITS FOR THE STABILITY ETCETERA BUT IT'S ALSO. THIS IS NOT AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE A SURPLUS OF OF QUALIFIED WORKERS SO FOR THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS -- FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS SOUGHT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- THAT WE HAVE CONTINUITY IN THE WORK FORCE OUT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE SAFETY INVESTMENTS THE TRANSFORMATION THE CONTINUED A RELIABLE SERVICE WHICH IS ACTUALLY A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF INSURING THAT THE THE PS PS THE CURRENT SHOT OFF THAT ARE BEING DONE. ARE USED TO SPARE LEAST POSSIBLE THAT ELECTRICITY IS RIPPED RESTORED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- AND THAT WE GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERRUPTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE CURRENTLY -- THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED SO YOU KNOW THE PART OF THE THE THE IT GETTING IT GETTING GOING ON THESE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE. GETTING THE GREAT HARDENING GETTING THE OTHER ELEMENTS IN PLACE THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE -- FOR GETS PGA ANY CLOSER TO WORST INDIO GAS AND ELECTRIC IS WHERE WHEN THEY LOOK AT CONDITIONS ANY ANY SHOW ANY INTERRUPTIONS ARE SHORTER. MORE LOCALIZED THE POWER -- RESTORATION HAPPENS FASTER -- THE SAFETY INVESTMENTS THE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS ARE IMPORTANT TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. THAT IS HAPPENING YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE THE SERVICE INTERRUPTION THAT FOLKS ARE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING IN P. JEANNIE SERVICE TERRITORY IN EDISON TERRITORY HAPPENS IS A CELL THE MOST POSSIBLE SO. IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL -- YOU KNOW AND THE OVERALL WORKER PROTECTIONS WE WE THINK THEY'RE VERY CRITICAL THE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT. THE PC HAS OVERSIGHT WHEN THERE ARE NOT AGREEMENTS REACHED OR WHEN THERE IS NOT OR WHEN THE BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER A SUCCESSOR TO PGA ANY. IN A SERVICE TERRITORY WOULD HAVE BENEFITS THAT ARE INFERIOR TO THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDED SO IF THERE'S AN AGREEMENT OR IF THERE ARE -- IF THERE ARE BENEFITS THAT ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL OR HIGHER THAN THESE PROVISIONS -- DON'T DON'T -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT BASICALLY THERE IS A BUILT IN MECHANISM FOR FOLKS TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS IT IT'S PROVIDING THE WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY. TO DO THAT WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH -- WITH THE VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE RAISED ISSUES AND IF THERE OFFER SEEN CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY'RE UNFORESEEN CHALLENGES. WE YOU KNOW WE WILL -- WE WILL BRING THIS TO THE ATTENTION BUT OUR SENSES IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO HAVE THESE WORKER PROTECTIONS AND WE THINK THESE CHANGES ARE JUSTIFIED IN APPROACH. YEAH WHAT. EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THE WORKERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT BOB WELL KNOWN ISSUE THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH WORKERS TO GO AROUND RIGHT NOW SO WE NEED TO PROTECT THE ONES WE HAVE. THE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S NOT. NOT JUST MAKING SURE. P. JEANNIE GETS A CONTINUE PRACTICING BAD BEHAVIOR AND THAT WE MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR THEM RATHER THAN HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. IF I MAY ON THE QUESTION OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION THIS IS ONE OF THE THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THE AMENDMENTS -- HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY STRENGTHENED THE BILL INCLUDED MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AND AND SKIN IN THE GAME NOT ONLY FOR THE CORPORATIONS WOULD FOR EXECUTIVE SO THERE ARE STRONG PROVISIONS IN THE MEASURE WHERE THE PC WILL HAVE TO REVIEW THE PLANS FOR INCENTIVES THAT ARE. THAT THE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE AND THERE'S LANGUAGE AROUND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT NO -- NO INCENTIVES BEING. FOLKS NOT BEING ELIGIBLE FOR INCENTIVES OR BONUSES WHEN THE UTILITY BECAUSE THE WALL FAR THE LEADS IN LATIN TO THE DEATH THEY'RE BROUGHT IT BROADER STANDARDS THAT. THAT TIED TO JUST BROADLY LINKING. COMPENSATION INCENTIVE BONUSES TO SAFETY. ANY CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BUT KEY ONES WOULD BE DETAILED WITH THE POSSIBILITY BUT NO 1100% INCENTIVE NOT BEING PROVIDED WHEN. WHEN AN ENTITY IS NOT MEETING ITS SAFETY OBLIGATIONS AND OR WHEN IT CAUSES A WILDFIRE THAT RESULTS AND -- AND IN ONE OR MORE FATALITIES AND I THINK I DID SIGNAL WHICH MEANT WHEN I SAID THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS ARE PAYING HIGHER RATES AND I I THINK I SAW THAT KNOWLEDGE MAN ON THAT AND HAVE LOWER. WILDFIRES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ABOUT FOUR AM I RECOGNIZE MEMORIES ARE THERE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WISH TO BE. RECOGNIZED. MR TANG ANY OTHERS. AT AND WE'LL GO WITH THESE THREE AND BRING IT TO A CONCLUSION. FAST PACKED WITH GREAT MEMORIES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE. TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAIR HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYES AND TO THE GOVERNOR THE ADMINISTRATION -- THIS HAS BEEN -- QUITE AN ORDEAL PUTTING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER. I I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IS A MEMBER OF LAST YEARS SB. NINE OH ONE FRIENDS COMMITTEE I RECOGNIZE. I UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUS NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO STABILIZE CALIFORNIA. FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA NOT FOR THE BENEFIT OF CORPORATIONS ARE INVESTORS BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VICTIMS IN THE RATE PAYERS AND THE WORKERS. AND FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. I I REALLY I I I HAVE SPOKEN WITH EACH OF YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE. GIVEN TO TO TO US AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND TWO OTHER COLLEAGUES. TO TO TAKE TIME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE EACH OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD LOTS OF QUESTIONS. THAT'S WHY. EVEN TO NOW I STILL STRUGGLE WITH. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AS I READ IT. AND I HAVE READ IT. AND I SIT WITH MEMBERS WHO HAVE READ IT NOT ONLY WHEN IT WAS FIRST PRESENTED TO US BUT EVEN AFTER THE AMENDMENTS. IT TAKES TIME TO READ THROUGH IT BUT WE HAVE READ IT BECAUSE THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO US. MANY HAVE SAID AND I AGREE THE BILL IS FAR FROM PERFECT. IN THE PROCESS THAT WAS TAKEN TO BRING IT BEFORE US HAS ALSO BEEN LESS THAN PERFECT. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE BILL. PROPOSES A SHIFTING OF THE BURDEN. FOR TALKING ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE UTILITIES. CHANGING IT FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR ELECTRICAL OPERATIONS. WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CERTIFICATE? I KNOW THAT THAT I SPEAK FOR SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES. THERE WERE HOPEFUL THAT THE CERTIFICATION WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE THAT THAT CERTIFICATION WILL REALLY SIGNIFIED THAT THESE ARE GOOD PLAYERS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE. AND MY GREATEST CONCERN. IS HOLDING THE TELE TO USE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR. I I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO ASSESS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS NEW REALITY OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES [inaudible] GET IT. FOR IT BEING ASKED TO TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH. ON A BILL. WE'VE SEEN IN PRINT. FOR A FEW WEEKS. WITH LIMITED OPPORTUNITY. FOR THOUGHTFUL AMENDMENTS. AND MORE ROBUST [inaudible] CONVERSATION. I THINK THAT AS A LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES. ARE WE CREATING A MORAL HAZARD. HOW WE CREATED A SITUATION WE DEPEND SO MUCH ON A CORPORATION? THAT WE FEEL WE MUST REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS. THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT I GRAPPLE WITH THE WORLD. ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OUR ACTIONS WILL HAVE ON ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AIR POLLUTION. THE PROTECTION OF RATE PAYERS A PROTECTION OF VICTIMS THE PROTECTION OF OUR WORKERS. AND THE RICH IN THE END THE RELIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRIC GRID. HI I I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN WITH WITH WITH EACH OF YOU AND I I AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR ALL THE TIME THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS. BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU'VE PUT IN SO MUCH TIME AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS YOU'RE PRESENTING TO US. BUT BUT I I REMAIN TORN ON THIS BILL. AND I DO QUESTION WHETHER WHAT WE'RE PRESENTED WITH THE NOW IN. THE AS IT IN THE CURRENT DRAFT THAT WE HAVE. WITH THIS LIMITED TIME THAT WE'VE HAD TO DELIBERATE. WHETHER THIS IS THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO [inaudible] PROTECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARE AYE FIRST I JUST WANT TO THANK. THE THREE AUTHORS THE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR WORKING. IT GREEN OF EXTREMELY HARD SINCE SINCE JANUARY ON PUTTING THIS PACKAGE TOGETHER AS I'VE MENTIONED TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE INDIVIDUALLY I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE. ABOUT THIS PACKAGE. IT'S VERY IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE SHAREHOLDER FUNDS. REALLY COME FIRST OVER RATE PAYER FUNDS I THINK THAT'S VERY WELL DELINEATED -- VERY HAPPY THE SEEDS STICK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OVERSIGHT OVER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND REALLY FLUSHING OUT THAT PROCESS THAT WAS IN SB NINE OH ONE THERE. REALLY DICTATES ON THAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SUPPOSED TO CURRENT NO THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHEN WE TOOK THAT THE LAST YEAR -- IN HOW THIS PROCESS TO PLAY OUT TO THINK THIS IS THE NEXT ITERATION OF THAT IT'S IT'S VERY GOOD. TO SEE THAT IN THE END IT NAY LAST THAT THINK THE THE BILL HAS DONE -- YOU KNOW FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE JOB THAT BALANCING A VERY BROAD ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE. FOR MOST OF MY TIME MY PIERCING WHEN YOU SEE. ON THE ELECTRICAL WORKERS WITH IOUS WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES. WITH TURNED WITH. THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND CONSUMER TERRY'S IT'S A FAIRLY -- IMPRESSIVE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER IT'S VERY RARE. TO SEE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY MY PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM HE WOULD ARTICULATED REGARDING THE INVOLUNTARY INVOLUNTARY CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF ASSETS FROM COULD ELECTRICAL COMPANY TO OUR PUBLIC ENTITY AND SO I THINK. THAT THAT'S CREATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONSTERNATION IN OPPOSITION IN MY OWN CITY -- THAT'S MATED -- CHALLENGING FOR FOR ME TO SUPPORT IT I KNOW OUR SENATOR -- WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY. WE WE HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED. BUT AT THIS POINT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION AS IT'S WRITTEN BECAUSE AT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND MEMBER GARCIA AND I BELIEVE THAT IS IT ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO BE RECOGNIZED IF NOT [inaudible] UP. FLOOR IS YOURS AND THEN WILL LOVE ASK FOR THE CLOTHES. THANK YOU -- WHEN THIS WHEN THIS BILL? THERE WAS THROUGH AN ARTICLE OR DRUGS ALLOW INTEREST CAME BEFORE US A FEW WEEKS AGO TWO TWO DAY THERE HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN AMENDMENTS AND TAKING A NUMBER OF US HAVE. POINTED OUT DIFFERENT WEAKNESSES WITHIN THE BILL AND AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAS BEEN MEANT. AND AMENDMENTS THERE BUT I THINK MY CONCERN IS THE BIGGER PICTURE ABOUT A PICTURE. OF WHETHER OR NOT WE LOOK THAT AND REALLY TOOK SERIOUSLY EIGHT THE IDEA OF A DIFFERENT MODEL -- AND OUR ELECTRICITY SECTOR OUT THERE AND WHETHER WE'VE GIVEN THAT IN NO TIME AND I DON'T FEEL THAT WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS EVEN CONSIDERED WHEN THE DISCUSSIONS -- STARTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE AUTHORS OUT THERE IN A DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. IN DISCUSSIONS WHETHER IT'S TO DO MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN TO SCHOOL TALKING ABOUT. SEVENTY THE FERRY TO HAVE A PUBLIC ENTITY WHETHER IT'S IN STOCK THEN WITH DIFFERENT FOLKS OUT THERE HAVE BROUGHT IT UP BUT IN GENERAL MY DISCUSSION IS NOT JUST ABOUT THIS PUBLIC ENTITIES BUT JUST. HAS THE EXPERIMENT WE BEEN DOING FIT. THE REALITY OF CALIFORNIA NOT JUST WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WITH WILDFIRES WITH ALL THE OTHER POLICIES WE HAVE THEM OF RENEWABLES AND EVERYTHING ELSE ALONG THE WAY. IT'S A CRISIS ALLOWS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND I DON'T FEEL THAT WE'VE TAKEN ADVANTAGEOF THAT OPPORTUNITY AND WE ARE WHERE WE HAD TO DO AND AND OUR WINDOW HAS CLOSED. GIVEN HERE SEVEN YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE ALL SEVEN YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT WHAT WE SAY YES WE'RE GONNA COME BACK AND REVISIT THAT WE DON'T -- AND THAT'S WHERE MY CONCERN COMES TO DAY -- WITH WITH WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY. INSIDE OUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU KNOW IF A DIMINISH YOU SAID THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO BE JUST AS VALID AS HE WAS WITH THIS BILL WITH A BIGGER DISCUSSION. INTO THE PHALLUS AS FAR AS THE TIME LANDING AT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND ESPECIALLY IF US MUSCLE NOT JUST A STRIKE FIRST BUT TO DO OTHER. THINGS -- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T I'VE I HAVEN'T HAD A COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM. BUT I ALSO HAVE BEEN HERE LONG ENOUGH THAT IF IT'S NOT FROM THE BOSS. IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. AND SOTHAT THAT'S THAT'S MY COMMENT OF MY CONCERN TODAY I DON'T. WANT TO REITERATE YOU KNOW THE OTHER SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE HAVEN'T HAD BUT THAT'S MY ISSUE WITH THIS ALL ALONG WHETHER IT'S TALKING ABOUT. INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHETHER THAT THAT SHOULD BE. ON THE PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SECTOR OR GENERATION AND THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES TO THIS BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A BIGGER DISCUSSION OVERALL AND I THINK IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE GOING TO BE HERE AGAIN JUST LIKE I DON'T WANT TO DISCOVER PROBLEMS. WE ARE IN A NEW REALITY EVERY DAY BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. OUT THERE. THANK YOU MEMBERS APPRECIATED. TO THE PROPONENTS FOR CLOTHES. IF I CAN GO FIRST IF THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I I'VE ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION AND FACTS -- I'LL TELL YA -- WITH -- THE TO COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON A MONDAY -- I FOUND IN THE SENATE. AT THIS OF MY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE THIS ISSUE THIS BILL BEFORE US -- IT HAS BEEN STUDIED AND READ THERE'S BEEN OF INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF EDUCATION ON THIS AND SO I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHEN WHEN FOLKS SAY YOU KNOW THIS THING IS BEING RUSHED -- I I DO TAKE A BIT OF ISSUE WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO REPLAY ALL OF THE TIME THAT WE HAVE SPENT. ON THIS I IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN SOME NUMBER BURKE LED A GROUP OF OF LEGISLATORS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE A BIPARTISAN WORKING GROUP THAT THAT MET WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND. THE THE THE LARGER QUESTIONS BEFORE US AS IT PERTAINED TO WILDFIRES IN THE RISKS THEY HAD TO OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND PUBLIC ON UTILITIES. I WAS ON THAT WHILE WORKING GROUP AT THE SAME TIME -- THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE CHAIR HOLDEN ALSO HAD ANOTHER A MORE FORMAL WORKING GROUP WHERE WE SPENT MOST OF THE YEAR WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE VERY SAME THINGS WHICH ENDED UP COMMENTATING -- IN THE NIGHT A ONE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. ABOUT MID YEAR LAST YEAR I HAD COME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT OF EXACT I WASN'T THE ONE THAT FIRST CAME OF SOMEBODY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF A OF A RISK POOL -- AS AT AN INSURANCE FUND I'M AND WE BEGAN EXPLORING BUT DURING THE NIGHT A ONE BY A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WE RAN OUT OF A TIME AND WE KNEW THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT BUT THERE WAS LANGUAGE -- PUT INSIDE THAT NINE A ONE CONFERENCE REPORT THAT SAID WE'RE GONNA PUT TOGETHER AND I DON'T WANT -- COMMISSION. WE HAD A NEW GOVERNOR THE NEW GOVERNOR CAME IN AND RIGHT AWAY. RIGHT AWAY HE PUT TOGETHER A A STRIKE FORCE AND SAID THAT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS ARE GOING TO COME OUT WITH A REPORT. SO IN THE STRIKE FORCE REPORT WHICH IS OUT WHICH WAS SOME SAID NOT BOMB LIKE THE ENOUGH BUT CAME UP WITH THIS CONCEPT OF A WILDFIRE FUND. AND THEN WE ENDED UP WITH -- THE NOT A ONE CAN AND ASKING THEM TO TO HURRY UP SO AS QUICKLY AS THEY COULD THEY CAME UP WITH AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -- AND AND GAVE THAT TO US AND THEN AFTER THAT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THEY PUT THEY THEY PUBLISH THAN A LARGER VERSION OF IT WHICH I TALKED ABOUT THIS THIS WILD FIRE FUND. I HAD A BILL BACK IN JANUARY THAT WAS INTRODUCED AND I'VE HAD A REVOLVING DOOR STAKEHOLDERS COMING IN AND OUT OF OF MY OFFICE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE -- HAS HAD A BILL THAT SHE'S HAD A A A REVOLVING DOOR STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER MEETINGS WITH WITH FOLKS THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS. WE HAVE HAD -- THERE'S NOT BEEN AN ISSUE THAT I CAN TELL YOU SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE MY FIVE YEARS INCLUDING CAP AND TRADE. WHAT WE HAVE SPENT THIS MUCH TIME AND HAD THIS MUCH PUBLIC INPUT I INTO A INTO A BILL? AND HERE'S THE OTHER FACT IT IS TRUE THAT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE SAW WE SAW THE THE LANGUAGE BEFORE US AND I CAN TELL YOU IS THE REPUBLICAN -- THAT -- ENDED UP BEING A JOINT AUTHR ON THIS BILL I WAS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED I'LL TELL YOU AT FIRST NOT HAVING ALL THE LANGUAGE WANTED TO SEE IT UP FRONT. SO I READ WHEN I GOT THAT EVERY SINGLE WORD OF OF THAT OF OF THAT BILL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO LIKE LAST YEAR. DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD THAT YOU DIDN'T READ EVERY SINGLE WORDS I READ EVERY SINGLE WORD AND THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE -- SEVENTY PAGES OF AMENDMENTS THAT I FREAKED OUT ABOUT THOSE SEVENTY PAGES OF AMENDMENTS -- THAT THATCAME UP BE AWARE THOUGH THAT THE WEATHER'S A MINUTES CAME UP BECAUSE I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THERE ARE SEE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS BEHIND US THEY'RE NOT JUST THE STATE FOR THEIR A HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE THE ALL HAD AN OPINION OF WHAT THIS BILL MIGHT LOOK LIKE. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY IS NOT ONE THAT IF I WAS GOING TO DO A DRAFT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. I WON IT THE FACT I CAN TELL YOU CAN POINT OUT ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT I THAT I DON'T LIKE. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IF WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THE BILL IT WOULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IT IS BEFORE US TODAY. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION ACT LIKE AN EXECUTIVE SHOULD. THEY LISTENED TO US THEY BROUGHT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN AND THEY CRAFTED A COMPROMISE MEASURE AND I CAN'T THINK OF A MEASURE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON BUT THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC A BILL IT IS NOT A REPUBLICAN BILL IT IS A BIPARTISAN BILL IS A NON PARTISAN BILL. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. BECAUSE I THINK WE WERE JUST GONNA. YOU MADE TO CLOSE DOWN. WE'RE ALL PLEASED ALL THREE I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I GUESS THE THING BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE REMARKS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA I MAY THINK THAT BOTH HOLDEN AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT EXPRESSING -- EXPRESSING THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE. OF THE UTILITIES LOOKS LIKE AND I THINK -- THEY HAVE PROVEN BOTH TO LISTEN CAREFULLY AND TO KEEP GOOD TO THEIR WORD -- TOO SO AMBER EGGMAN I WILL TELL YOU THAT. BEFORE YOU EVEN SPOKE ON AND I HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WHAT WE WILL BUT WHAT WILL BE DONE FOR RELIEF FOR BOTH AG AND LARGE ENERGY USERS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OVER THE BREAK IN. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN VERY OPEN ABOUT THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THEM FOR THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS -- THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES SURROUNDING THIS FUND AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE TALK ABOUT HARDENING AND PREVENTION AND INSURANCE ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT FINISHED. WE STILL HAVE OTHER WORK TO DO THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE CONVERSATION BUT THIS IS A PIVOTAL POINT IN THE CONVERSATION AND THIS WAS SOMETHING. THAT CANNOT BE PUSHED ASIDE ANYMORE BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN THE COST OF INACTION. AND WE HAVE SEEN THE DEVASTATION AND I AM SO SORRY TO THOSE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO NOT ONLY LOST THEIR HOMES BUT HAVE LOST FAMILY MEMBERS. AND THAT IS THE COST THAT WE HAVE ALL PAID FOR NOT DOING THE PREVENTIVE MEASURES THAT WE SHOULD HAVE DEMANDED LONG IN ADVANCE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TESTIFIED IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THEIR HOME FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOU HEARD TODAY OR ON THEIR PHONES WHEN THEY LOST THEIR LOVED ONES. WE BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT AND TO NOT ACT WOULD BE OUR RESPONSIBILITY SO WE DO HOLD A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SOME ACTION AND THIS IS AN ACTION IN WHICH WE REQUIRE. ACCOUNTABILITY. WHERE WE COUNT AS WE REQUIRES A SKIN IN THE GAME? I'M NOT JUST FROM OURSELVES BUT FROM THE UTILITIES -- AND NOT FROM IT JUST FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ESPECIALLY FROM THOSE WHO HAVE BEHAVED POORLY. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD SAY -- I I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEANS A LOT OF WORK HAS GONE INTO THIS. YES THIS FINAL PRODUCT IS FAIRLY NEW BUT WE HAVE SPENT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM HAVE SPENT HOURS. AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. WE HAVE SPENT OUR FREE TIME OUR BREAK TIME OUR WORK TIME BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. SO FOR THOSE WHETHER IT IS THOSE IN OPPOSITION OR WHETHER IT IS THE NEWSPAPERS YOU'RE WRONG. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AND THIS HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. I TELL YOU PERSONALLY I WENT TO PARADISE AND I SAW THE DEVASTATION. I SAW YOUNG KIDS WHO WHO NOT JUST A RECOVERING FROM A TRAUMA BUT ARE AFRAID THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING HOME. IT IS INCUMBENT ON US TO ACT. AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT IT IS OUR JOB IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I LIKE MY COLLEAGUE I WON'T KNOW IF I'VE ENJOYED THIS DISCUSSION UNTIL AFTER YOU BOTH. GET ME SITTING ON PINS AND NEEDLES HERE -- LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- WE JUST SAY THAT -- ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID IS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THIS IS -- WE'RE SITTING HERE BEFORE YOU AS HAVING -- BEEN A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND ABOUT ALL OF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED AS WELL -- WE'RE NOT IN IT. BY OURSELVES AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE IS A SOLUTION TO A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM. AND THAT PROBLEM IMPACTS ON OF THE RESIDENTS THE VICTIMS. OF THE INDUSTRY ITSELF YOU KNOW. I DO WE HAVE THE PERFECT PLAN I'LL TELL YOU WE DON'T. BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY GOOD PLAN [inaudible] THOUGHTFUL. WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. WHO ARE PORING OVER THE DETAILS WHO HAVE ENGAGED WITH US THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND BEEN OUT. IF WE DO NOTHING. WHICH IS THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE HERE. THIS PLAN OR NOTHING. IF WE DO NOTHING. WE'VE HEARD THAT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WILL BE DOWNGRADED. TO JUNK BOND STATUS. THAT MAY MEAN SOME TO SOME MEANS SOMETHING TO SOME IT MAY MEAN NOTHING TO OTHERS I DON'T KNOW IT'S ON EVERYBODY'S MIND HOW THEY WANT TO EVALUATE IT. AND IF THEY GO TO JUNK BOND STATUS. AND YOU ALREADY HAVE. A UTILITY LAST YEAR THAT WENT TO JUNK BOND STATUS. AND THEN THERE WAS A CATASTROPHIC FIRE. IN THEIR TERRITORY AND NOW THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY. WHO BENEFITED BY THAT? THE PEOPLE WHO LOST EVERYTHING. WERE VICTIMIZED AGAIN. BECAUSE THEN THEY WERE DRAGGED. INTO BANKRUPTCY WHERE THEY WENT TO THE END OF THE LINE UNSECURED CREDITORS. WHO LOST EVERYTHING [inaudible] AND NOW. THEY STAND TO LOSE AGAIN. SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE DO. DO WE LEARN. YES IT'S NEW FRONT TIER BUT WE'VE NOW LEARNED SOMETHING. NOW HOW DO WE REACT TO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. THIS IS NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION. AND I THINK THAT WE'VE SAID ALL ALONG THAT. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TO DAY AFTER TOMORROW AFTER THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THIS BILL SHOULD GET TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IS THAT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO? WE DON'T PACK UP AND GO AWAY JUST BECAUSE THIS BILL PASSES THERE ARE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TO THE MICROPHONE TODAY THAT WE SAID I MADE A COMMITMENT THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. LARGE USERS WHO REPRESENTS. CUSTOMERS WHO USE A LOT OF POWER. WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO TAKE IT ON THE CHIN WITH THIS BILL? BUT THEY'RE STANDING HERE EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN'T SUPPORT IT. BECAUSE IT'S A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE PREPARED TO STAND WITH YOU. AND NOT OPPOSE IT NOT CALL IT A BAILOUT BUT SAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO AND WORK TOGETHER. COLLECTIVELY AS ONE CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE ALL IMPACTED BY. AND SO I THINK WE STAND HERE WITH THE BEST PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE. RE EITHER MOVE FORWARD IN THE MOMENT. THINKING THAT HEY THIS WILL GET US. DOWN THE ROAD. THE ISSUES THAT MR TING IS RAISED IN HIS DISTRICT IN MISTER TWO AND MISTER THE END SENATOR WINNER. THOSE ARE REAL ISSUES AND I THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE AND ALSO MISS SEGMENTS DISTRICT. THESE ARE REAL ISSUES. BECAUSE WE'RE STILL THIS IS A FRAGMENTED MARKET PLACE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL IT ALL TOGETHER AND SO -- MERCER. TO I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE DUG INTO THIS LIKE WE ALL HAVE. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS. BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK AT THE FACT THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO TAKE SOME ACTION. AND I'LL BE THIS NOT PERFECT I HOPE THAT YOU'LL ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU WILL SEE. THAT THERE IS VALUE IN SUPPORTING IT AND GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO KEEP HOPE ALIVE. THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR YOUR AYE VOTE.
