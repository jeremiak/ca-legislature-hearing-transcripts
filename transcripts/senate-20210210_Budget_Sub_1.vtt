THIS MORNING WE WANTED TO SHARE

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:34.934
OUR ASSESSMENTS AND

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.268
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE GOVERNOR

SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.138
PROPOSAL I'M STARTING WITH OUR

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.040
ASSESSMENTS FIRST WE THINK

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.341
DEVELOPING A SEPARATE FUNDING

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:43.843
PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.012
PRESCHOOL FURTHER COMPLICATES

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.079
HOW THE STATE FUNDS SPECIAL

00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:48.481
EDUCATION. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:49.782
PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOCATE

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:51.117
PRESCHOOL FUNDING TO A

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.818
DIFFERENT SET OF ENTITIES AND

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.186
USE A DIFFERENT ALLOCATION

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:55.488
FORMULA AND HOW THE STATE

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.956
PROVIDES THE REST OF THE K.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:57.690
TWELVE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:10:57.757 --> 00:10:59.592
FUNDING AND WE THINK THIS ADDS

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.360
UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY TO THE

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:03.229
FUNDING SYSTEM. THIS APPROACH

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:04.397
COULD ALSO MAKE REGIONAL

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:05.698
COORDINATION OF SERVICES

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:06.565
THROUGH SELFIES MORE

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.234
CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY SINCE

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.402
MANY SMALLER DISTRICTS

00:11:09.468 --> 00:11:10.903
COORDINATE SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.406
PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WITH OTHER

00:11:13.472 --> 00:11:15.341
DISTRICTS AND- SILVA. SECONDLY

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.710
BY PROVIDING ABOUT FIFTY FIVE

HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH

PRESCHOOLER WITH A DISABILITY

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:21.847
THIS PROPOSAL COULD CREATE A

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.749
NEW FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.484
OVER IDENTIFY CHILDREN FOR

PRESCHOOLER IDENTIFIED FOR

00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:30.689
SPECIAL EDUCATION WOULD

00:11:30.756 --> 00:11:32.825
GENERATE MORE FUNDING. CONCERN

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:35.694
OVER OVER A GREAT INDICATION IS

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:36.929
WHY THE STATE FUND SPECIAL

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.964
EDUCATION AS IT CURRENTLY DOES

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.366
BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT

STUDENTS RECEIVING SPECIAL

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:44.970
EDUCATION ALTHOUGH THIS

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.305
PROPOSAL MIGHT ENCOURAGE

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.274
DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.142

ON THE LEGISLATURE WILL ALSO

00:11:51.277 --> 00:11:52.578
WANT TO CONSIDER IN THE LONG

00:11:52.645 --> 00:11:54.380
TERM EFFECTS OF CREATING SUCH A

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:56.682
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. THIRD

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:58.084
GIVEN THAT THE ACTIVITIES

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.420

ACTIVITIES THEMSELVES ARE

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:05.057
RATHER BROAD IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.425
DISTRICTS WOULD ULTIMATELY USE

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:08.294
THIS FUNDING WITHOUT CLEAR

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.829
SPENDING RESTRICTIONS OR

ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES IT

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.131

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:13.566
LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE THE

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:15.334

ACTIVITIES SUCH AS INCLUSION

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.407

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.310
WARRANTED IN THE FUTURE LASTLY

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:24.877
THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T ADDRESS

PRESCHOOL CAN TO OTHERS. WE

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:36.255
SPOKE TO PRESCHOOL AS SPECIAL

TO PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.101
REGULATIONS THAT MAKE COMEDY

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:49.969
EATING A CHILD WITH

DISABILITIES MORE CHALLENGING

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:53.339
PROGRAM STAFF ME ALSO IF YOU'RE

00:12:53.405 --> 00:12:55.307
NOT PREPARED TO WORK WITH A

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:57.276

ESPECIALLY IF THEY DO NOT

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.184
ALREADY ATTEND A PRESCHOOL

00:13:05.251 --> 00:13:07.286
PROGRAM. FOR THESE REASONS WE

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:08.354
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.389
EXPANDS THE EXISTING BASED

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.458
FORMULA TO INCLUDE PRESCHOOL

00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:13.459
THIS APPROACH WOULD ALLOW TO

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.894
SEE TO RECOGNIZE LOCAL COSTS

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:20.332
INTRODUCED BY THE GOVERNOR'S

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.334

CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY TO SEE

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.738

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:29.909
PROXY FOR PRESCHOOL ATTENDANCE.

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:30.809
ESTIMATE THAT THIS APPROACH

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:32.111

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.176
USED TO PROVIDE I THINK

00:15:44.243 --> 00:15:46.178
CRITICAL. KIND OF CONTINUITY OF

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.513
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TWO YOUNG

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.914
CHILDREN AS WELL AS CHILDREN AT

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:50.983
RISK AND I THINK THAT'S- YOU

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.685
KNOW AN IMPORTANT NOTE TO

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.720
UNDERSCORE JUST IN TERMS OF- WE

00:15:54.787 --> 00:15:57.189
KNOW THAT. EARLY INTERVENTION

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.257
AND EARLY DEDICATION IS

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:00.526
CRITICAL- FOR SUPPORTING EARLY

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.794
LEARNERS EARLY LEARNERS WITH

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.430
DISABILITIES- JUST A FEW POINTS

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:09.768
TO NOTE- IN REGARDING- THE- IN

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:11.704
TERMS OF JUST THE EXISTING

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.041
BASE. FORMULA JUST A SORT OF

00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:17.176
FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN TERMS OF

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:19.244
REALLY- THAT THAT'S THE FUNDING

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:20.346
THROUGH THE EXISTING SPECIAL

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:21.980
EDUCATION BASED MAY DILUTE THE

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.315
PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.817
PRIORITIES HIGHLIGHTED IN THE

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.453
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- REALLY SO

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.088
IN IT OTHER WORDS ROLLING THIS

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.622
FUNDING INTO THE BASE COULD

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:31.690
COULD BE USED FOR ANY SORT OF

00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.125
SPECIAL EDUCATION PURPOSE AND

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.193
NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR PRESCHOOL

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:38.197
SO- THAT THAT WOULD. NOT BE A

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:39.565
COMPLICATING FACTOR BUT IT JUST

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.433
WOULD BE AN EXTRA CONSIDERATION

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.001
FOR ELLIE AS AND AN ACCOUNTING

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:44.436
AND TRACKING PURPOSES AS WELL

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:45.571
IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THOSE

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:46.739
DOLLARS YOU GET TO PRESCHOOL

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:50.876
STUDENTS AS WELL- AND THEN IT

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.411
DEFINITELY THESE FUNDS WOULD.

00:16:52.478 --> 00:16:53.846
THEN BE LIMITED ONLY SERVING

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:54.780
THOSE PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.882
DISABILITIES AND AGAIN- SORT OF

00:16:56.949 --> 00:17:00.652
FURTHER RESTRICTING- THE-

00:17:00.719 --> 00:17:02.087
ACCESSING THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:03.522
THOSE STUDENTS TO THAT ARE AT

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.890
RISK IDENTIFIED AT RISK FROM

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:06.492
RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS. I THINK

00:17:06.558 --> 00:17:09.695
ONE OTHER SALIENT POINT TWO TWO

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.898
UNDERSCORES WHILE IS THAT- YOU

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:16.468
KNOW THE- MODIFYING THE BASE TO

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:17.536
DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTEN

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.205
ATTENDANCE- FOR PART FOR

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.573
PROVIDING PRESCHOOL FUNDING

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.175
WOULD RESULT IN CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:24.109
RECEIVING THE FUNDING FOR THIS

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.678
PURPOSE- CHARTERS DO NOT SERVE

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:28.347
PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS. AND

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:29.681
FUNDING WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:30.749
THE NUMBER OF PRESCHOOL AGE OF

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:31.917
THE DISABILITIES AND SO

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:33.485
CHARTERS DID NOT RECEIVE THAT

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:35.454
FUNDING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.457
TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:40.526
MODIFYING THE BASE. FORMULA ARE

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:43.028
CURRENTLY- OR AS PROPOSED. IN

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.463
USING KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.498
THE PROXY WOULD RESULT IN

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:47.366
CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVING A

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:48.434
PORTION OF THE FUNDS THIS YEAR

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.202
AND SO ESSENTIALLY THAT WOULD

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.303
YOU KNOW INCREASE THE NUMBER

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.272
VALLEY AS AND THEREFORE- THE

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:56.475
AMOUNT OF FUNDS RECEIVED BY BY

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:56.975
EACH OTHER. IT WOULD BE

00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:00.712
IMPACTED AS WELL. THANK YOU

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.514

I HAVE TO JUST START ASKING

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.724

SAID. BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME.

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.966
ISSUES BETWEEN PEOPLE AND- LET

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:22.935

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:30.976
ANALYST'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE-

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.311
DIFFERENT WAYS SPENDING

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.746

FINANCE SO- I WOULD LIKE TO

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.628
NOTE THAT OUR INTENTION WAS TO

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.131
RESTRICT THESE FUNDS FOR- THESE

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:54.800
EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES NOT

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:56.235
ONLY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:58.971
STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR- STUDENTS

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:00.873
DOT AND A SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:05.310
MIGHT- THE SITE IS AT RISK- AND

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.280
BASICALLY THIS THE GOAL OF THIS

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:09.882
FUNDING IS ALTERNATELY EARLY

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:12.050
INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. SO

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.152
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THAT-

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.621
SECONDLY IT LIKE HEATHER

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:18.557
COLONIES HAD MENTIONED- IF THE

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.592
FUNDS ARE PUT INTO THE SPECIAL

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.060
EDUCATION BASE THERE'S NO

00:19:22.127 --> 00:19:24.329
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PRESCHOOL

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.198
SERVICES. AND NOTHING CURRENTLY

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:27.599
A STOPPING A SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.101
FROM CONTRACTING WITH A SOFA OR

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.669
ANY OTHER REGIONAL CONSORTIA TO

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.404
PROVIDE PROGRAMMING FOR THEIR

00:19:32.471 --> 00:19:37.609
PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND.

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.811
IN THE TOWN I CONCLUDE MY

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:41.580
REMARKS THEN LET ME ASK ONE

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:42.814
OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.684
BECAUSE THAT RESPONSE DAILYO.

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:47.853
BUT THE- DEPARTMENT OF

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.321
EDUCATION INDICATED THAT

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.856
CHANGING THE FORMULA EXPANDS

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.492
IT. TO DOUBLE COUNTED AND MOVE

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.494
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THEN IN A

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:56.895
DE FACTO WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:19:56.962 --> 00:19:59.464
SPREADING IT IN A MORE BROADWAY

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:01.700
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:04.002
WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUAL L. A. H.

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.371
FOR THIS PURPOSE HOW WOULD YOU

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:09.107
RESPOND TO THAT CONCERN. AND

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.543
THAT IS ALSO OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.078
OF IF THIS WERE TO GO THROUGH

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:14.680
THE BASE- WHAT DOUBLE COUNTED

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:18.417
CANDOR KINDERGARTEN EDA. AND

00:20:18.483 --> 00:20:20.319
SCHOOL DISTRICTS I HAVE THE

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.920
RESPONSIBILITY OF CHILD FIND

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:23.388
AND SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE

00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:25.557
CHILDREN NOT CHARTER SCHOOLS

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:28.660
SO. AND THAT IS A FOUNDED

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:30.862
CONCERNED. IF IT'S A FOUNDED

00:20:30.929 --> 00:20:31.830
CONCERNED DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.466
GOING TO ADDRESS IT SOMETIME

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:36.034
HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE MAY REVISE.

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:40.172
AT AS OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:43.675
STANDS THE- THE FUNDING WOULD

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:46.378
ONLY GO TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:20:46.445 --> 00:20:46.979
THAT ARE SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:51.049
CHILDREN. EVEN IF THE USERS ARE

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:53.018
YOURS HE SAID IT WAS UNFOUNDED

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.720
CONCERN BUT THEN YOU JUST SORT

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:57.155
OF SAID IT WASN'T TRUE- WHERE

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:58.957
ARE WE HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:01.960
SORRY ABOUT DOUBLE COUNTING AND

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.829
BRING IN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN. SO

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:05.831
THAT THE CONCERN IS ABOUT THE

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:08.133
ELLIOTT THE L. A. IS PROPOSAL

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:08.667
TO DOUBLE COUNT

00:21:08.734 --> 00:21:11.370
KINDERGARTENERS- THE

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.772
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS.

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:15.540
AN ALLOCATION BASED ON THE

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.775
NUMBER OF PRESCHOOL STUDENTS

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.010
WITH DISABILITIES THAT OUR

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.144
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SERVING AND

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:21.013
SO ONLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:24.016
RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS SO WHICH-

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.851
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS

00:21:25.917 --> 00:21:27.352
ACTUALLY SPEAKING TO THE L. A.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:29.054
O.'S PROPOSAL WHEN THEY SAID

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.957
THAT NOT. YOURS CORRECT OKAY.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:34.292
THEN BOB LET ME GIVE THE L. A.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:36.294
O. WITH CHANCE TO RESPOND TO

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:38.063
WHAT THE OTHER TWO ENTITIES

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.366
SAID ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATION-

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:42.367
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT. THEIR

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:43.835
CONCERNS ARE EITHER OF CONCERN

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:46.571
OR NOT OF CONCERN- I THINK WE

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.439
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM

00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:48.874
BALLOTS AND DEPARTMENT OF

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.841
FINANCE AND STATE DEPARTMENT OF

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:51.877
EDUCATION I WOULD JUST SEE IN

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:54.246
TERMS OF POTENTIALLY DILUTING-

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:56.248
SAID THEIR POLICY OBJECTIVES

00:21:56.314 --> 00:21:57.549
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.351
VERSUS THE ALLEY ELSE PROPOSAL

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:00.585
WHICH IS JUST TO AUGMENT THE

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.254
BASED INCLUDE PRESCHOOLERS. I

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.690
THINK I MEAN UNDERLYING- OPEN

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.792
QUESTION IS REALLY HOW THE

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:08.193
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THOSE

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.795
FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED I

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:11.630
THINK IT'S UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW AS

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:12.831
TO WHETHER OR NOT THOSE PLANS

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:13.899
ARE ON RESTRICTED WHETHER OR

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.701
NOT THEY ARE RESTRICTED I THINK

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.736
BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT AND IS

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.638
THROUGH INTENT LANGUAGE IT'S

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:20.372
UNCLEAR HOW DISTRICTS WILL

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.207
FOLLOW. HOW CLOSELY THEY WILL

00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:23.875
FOLLOW TO THE INTENT TO UNDER

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:24.910
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT'S

00:22:24.976 --> 00:22:26.111
STILL VERY MUCH FROM OUR

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:27.379
INTERPRETATION IT'S THEIR VERY

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.613
MUCH POSSIBLE THAT DISTRICTS

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.049
COULD USE THIS FUNDING TO FIND

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.418
EXISTING PRESCHOOL SERVICES-

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:34.753
OUR INTERPRETATION IS THAT THAT

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.854
IS ALLOWED UNDER HELD A

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.189
PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY WRITING

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:38.356
BECAUSE IT IS MAINLY THROUGH

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:39.925
INTENT LANGUAGE. AND SO WE

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:41.660
THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS CAN

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:42.594
IT KIND OF STILL APPLY IN THAT

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.262
SENSE IN TERMS OF THE CHARTER

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:45.497
SCHOOL ASPECT I THINK THERE ARE

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:47.332
DEFINITELY WAYS FOR US TO NOT

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:48.600
DOUBLE COUNT KINDERGARTEN FOR

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.102
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I'M NOT

00:22:50.168 --> 00:22:51.303
ENTIRELY SURE HOW BIG OF A

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.404
CHALLENGE IT WOULD BE FOR SEAT

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:54.573
BUT IN TERMSOF- JUST

00:22:54.639 --> 00:22:55.674
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:56.942
RECOGNIZING THAT TERM SCHOOLS

00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:58.043
DO NOT SERVE THIS. AGE GROUP

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.844
WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN WITH

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.278
DISABILITIES I THINK THAT IS

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:02.214
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- CONSIDER

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.181
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FINAL

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:04.850
DETAILS OF A FOLLOWING A

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:06.718
RECOMMENDATION TO LOOK LIKE AND

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:07.352
THEN I WOULD JUST SAY IT MORE

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.554
GENERALLY- I THINK THE REASON

00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.089
WHY WE WOULD PREFER AN APPROACH

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:12.824
SHOULD EXPAND THE BEAST IS JUST

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.392
THAT IT WOULD STREAMLINE HOW

00:23:14.459 --> 00:23:15.327
THE STATE PROVIDE SPECIAL

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:17.529
EDUCATION FUNDING. AND THEN IT

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:19.431
WAS ADDITIONAL FUNDS THIS THE

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:20.465
LEGISLATURE COULD LOOK AT MORE

00:23:20.532 --> 00:23:22.601
TARGETED LEADS TO PROMOTE THESE

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:23.869
POLICY OBJECTIVES SUCH AS

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:24.469
INCLUSION AND EARLY

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.471
INTERVENTION WE THINK PROVIDING

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:29.374
IT IN A YEAR- IN THE PRESCHOOL

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.009
GRANTS SUCH AS THE ONE PROPOSED

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:32.244
BY THE GOVERNOR WE THINK IT'S

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.378
VERY POSSIBLE THAT

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:34.613
ACCOUNTABILITY MIGHT ALSO BE

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:36.248
LOST IN IN THE WAY THAT THAT

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:37.549
FUNDING IS ALLOCATED AS WELL.

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:39.017
THERE'S NO REPORTING THAT WHAT

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.285
WE WOULD REQUIRE FROM DISTRICTS

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:41.920
MONEY SPEND THIS FINDING AND

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:43.722
BECAUSE OF THAT RATHER VIEWS

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:49.895
NATURE. OF THIS INTENT LANGUAGE

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:50.896
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNCLEAR IT'S

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.731
NOT. CLEAR WHAT THE- OBJECT. OF

00:23:52.798 --> 00:23:55.267
FUNDING ACTUALLY. THANK YOU.

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.735
AND I THINK I COULD KEEP GOING

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.804
FOREVER WITH EVERYONE BUT LET

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.806

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.374

YOU SENATOR I THINK THAT WE

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:12.017
WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT OUR

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.585
POLICY CONCERNS ARE NOT ABOUT

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.120
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.621
ACTUALLY OF THE L. A. O.'S

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.757
PROPOSAL AND WE WOULD ALIGN

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:19.558
OURSELVES MORE CLOSELY WITH THE

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.060
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS AS

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:22.561
HEATHER OUTLINED. IN HER

QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST MAKE

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.336
A BRIEF COMMENT WHICH IS. IT

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:32.537
SEEMS THAT THERE'S STILL SOME

00:24:32.604 --> 00:24:34.206
WORK TO DO IT AT LEAST

00:24:34.272 --> 00:24:36.541
UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT THE

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:39.878
IMPACTS ARE. EVEN IF OF PEOPLE

00:24:39.945 --> 00:24:41.513
BELIEVE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.815
THINK THE IMPACTS ARE BUT SO I

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:45.550
JUST HOPE YOU'LL USE THE TIME.

00:24:45.617 --> 00:24:47.219
BETWEEN NOW AND WALKING DOWN

00:24:47.285 --> 00:24:48.787
THE MAY REVISED TO MAKE SURE

00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:50.488
EVERYBODY'S CLEAR. THAT I'M

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.991
TOTALLY FINE IF YOU DISAGREE ON

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:54.192
THE SUBSTANCE AND WE CAN SORT

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:56.328
OF. FIGUREOUT WHAT WE THINK ON

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.762
THAT TOO BUT IT BE NICE IF

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.397
THERE WAS SOME AN AGREEMENT ON

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:01.533
WHAT THE INTERPRETATION REALLY

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.236
MEANS SO THAT. WE CAN DECIDE

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:06.471
WHAT IT IS THAT. WE WOULD HAVE

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.306
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE ITEMS

00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:10.108
SO LET ME ASK YOU EITHER.

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.977

00:25:20.652 --> 00:25:21.753
BETWEEN THE FORMULAS OF HOW TO

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.356
FIND. THE SPECIAL NEEDS AND THE

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:25.924
CONCERNS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE.

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:28.360
AS HAVING THE FUNDS BEING

00:25:28.426 --> 00:25:30.662
RESTRICTED OR UNRESTRICTED- AND

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:31.696
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A SOME

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.932
SORT OF LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.467
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:38.270
IF UNRESTRICTED. ARE SET ASIDE

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.771
SPECIFICALLY FOR SPECIAL

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:43.408
EDUCATION- SO IF WE COULD SEE

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:44.709
SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT IN

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:47.312
MAKING SURE THAT IT DOES REALLY

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.281
TRULY GO TO SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.750
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL- I DO

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:55.720

FUNDING THAT NUMBER- MORE. IT

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.964
WAS A LUCRATIVE BUT A BETTER

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:15.367
FUNDING NUMBER FOR THE SCHOOL

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:17.502

RIGHT NOW I'M FOR PROPOSED WHAT

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.707

FINANCE- AS MY COLLEAGUE LIZ

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.194
WAS MENTIONING THAT THE

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.796
PROGRAMS ARE VERY SIMILAR THE

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:18.930
DIFFERENCE THIS YEAR IS THAT

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:19.864
THERE'S A LOOK AT THERE'S A

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:22.333
MORE TARGETED FOCUSED ON-

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.102
PRESCHOOLERS- INSTANCE THE

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:25.303
DISABILITIES WERE BEING SERVED

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.105
IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. BUT THE

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.307
ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY BETWEEN

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.975
ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN AMOUNT

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:31.776
AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THE

00:28:31.843 --> 00:28:33.812
SAME AND BOTH HAVE THAT FOCUSED

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:37.582
ON AND THE PRESCHOOL CAMPS. SO

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:38.483
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.484
THEY'RE RECEIVING WOULD BE

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.286
EXACTLY THE SAME EVEN THOUGH IT

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:42.754
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT FORMAT OR

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:45.390
FORMULA FOR FUNDING. THE

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.725
FORMULA ITSELF IS THE SAME.

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:48.927
AMOUNT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE

00:28:48.993 --> 00:28:50.361
SAME BECAUSE THE TWENTY

00:28:50.428 --> 00:28:51.496
NINETEEN AMOUNT AS YOU AS YOU

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.931
SAID IT WAS FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:28:52.997 --> 00:28:53.531
NINETY THREE MILLION. AND THE

00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:55.700
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS- THREE

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:56.301
HUNDRED BILLION SO THERE IS

00:28:56.367 --> 00:28:57.368
GOING TO BE EIGHT EIGHT

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:58.336
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.370
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT'S RECEIVE

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:00.839
JUST BECAUSE THERE IS- YOU KNOW

00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.841
LESS LESS MONEY BEING ALLOCATED

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:05.310
IN PROPOSAL THIS YEAR- BUT THE-

00:29:05.376 --> 00:29:07.579
FORMULA ITSELF. IS THE SAME

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:12.617
BETWEEN BOTH- BOTH PROGRAMS.

00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:16.087
OKAY SENATOR IF I MAY. ARE

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:16.688
GARNER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

EDUCATION. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.727
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED PER PUPIL ON

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:23.962
IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE NINE

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:26.531
THOUSAND PER PUPIL IN TWENTY

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:27.132
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.600
THE GRANT AMOUNT WAS GREATER SO

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.602
IT WAS NINE THOUSAND TWENTY

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:31.970
NINETEEN TWENTY. AND FOR US

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:33.838
THAT WE APPROXIMATE ABOUT FIFTY

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:35.073
FIVE HUNDRED IF WE USED THE

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.041
FORMULA USED THIS YEAR AND THE

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:39.144
NUMBERS YET- IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.115
PROPOSAL CURRENTLY. FIFTY FIVE

00:29:44.182 --> 00:29:47.452
HUNDRED. OKAY. SO MY SECOND

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.854
QUESTION WOULD BE. THIS

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:50.455
QUESTION IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:03.441
BEGIN WITH A QUESTION FOR THE

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:05.676
L. A. O. ANDTHEN PASS FINANCES

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.778
AND- THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:12.516
EDUCATION TO RESPOND. AND THE-

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.752
THE L. A. O. SAID THAT. THERE

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.454
IS ATASK FORCE COMING IT'S

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.889
GONNA REPORT IN OCTOBER. AND

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.358
SUGGESTED THAT WE NOT DEAL WITH

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.126
THIS BUDGET HERE WITH THIS

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.295
ISSUE. AND I WAS GOING TO ASK

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:27.264
IF THERE IS THE L. A. O. AND

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:29.233
THEN ASKED FINANCE AND

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:29.734
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.969
COMMENT. DO YOUTHINK THERE ARE

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:33.204
THINGS ON WHICH THEY'RE

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.106
OBVIOUSLY COMMON AGREEMENT THAT

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.607
WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THIS

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:39.076
YEAR BECAUSE OF THE URGENCY AND

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:44.115
NOT WAIT. UNTIL OF THE TASK

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:45.716
FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND.

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.384
SENATOR I THINK THAT IS A VERY

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.720
IMPORTANT QUESTION- AND I THINK

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:50.921
I'M I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:52.690
I HAVE A CLEAR SENSE AS TO WHAT

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.291
THE CONSENSUS PROBLEM AREAS ARE

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:55.960
I THINK THERE IS A NEED FOR

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:56.761
MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.929
SUPPORT. FOR DISTRICTS IT I

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.197
THINK IT REMAINS AN OPEN

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:02.166
QUESTION AS TO WHO AND WHAT AND

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.901
SEES WOULD BE BEST SERVED TO

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:05.469
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:06.437
WHETHER OR NOT THAT SHOULD BE

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.705
STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP THROUGH

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:08.939
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:09.507
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.375
HEALTH CARE. SERVICES OR IF WE

00:40:11.442 --> 00:40:13.444
SHOULD BE USING THAT THE

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:14.779
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH WHICH IS TO

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:17.314
IDENTIFY ELEAZAR COUNTY OFFICES

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.517
OF EDUCATION ALREADY DOING MASS.

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.018
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:21.786
IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR THE

00:40:21.852 --> 00:40:23.020
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:26.991
PERSONALLY I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.559
THEN LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:29.326
OF FINANCE IF YOU WOULD

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:32.096
RESPOND. TO THAT COMMENT AND

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:33.998
NOT CONCERNED AND AT THE SAME

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.933
TIME IF YOU TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.735
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.104
CONCERNED THAT THEY STILL NEED

00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:44.875
CLARIFICATION ON SOME THINGS.

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.310
RIGHT LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:48.212
FINANCE SO WE ARE WORKING WITH

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.981
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.683
CLARIFY. ON THOSE REQUIREMENTS

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.585
ARE JUST STILL IN CONVERSATIONS

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:56.720
BUT HAPPY TO COLLABORATE- IN

00:40:56.787 --> 00:41:00.124
TERMS OF- EARLY ACTIONS AND

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.725
THAT COULD BE TAKEN IN THIS

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:02.526
BUDGET YEAR TO ADDRESS THIS

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:04.795
ISSUE- WE HAVE BEEN HEARING

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.497
FROM THE FIELD FOR IT FOR YEARS

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:10.134
NOW. THIS NEED FOR MORE

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:12.136
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MORE.

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.737
WE'RE COULD POSSIBLY BUILDING

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:17.208
AND- THIS NEED TO FILL IN THIS

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:17.908
KNOWLEDGE GAP THAT EXISTS OUT

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.344
IN THE FIELD- AND THIS IS TRUE

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.315
REGARDLESS OF WHAT AND- WHAT

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:26.250
REFORMS MIGHT. OCCUR WHAT

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.353

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.225
CURRENTLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:36.393
WITH OUR HHS COUNTERPARTS

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.764
WITHIN FINANCE ABOUT- AS ABOUT

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:41.365
ACTIONS THAT CAN BE TAKEN OR

00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:45.035
WILL BE TAKEN- BUT-WE

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:47.438
UNDERSTAND THAT THE REAL-

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:51.008
SOMETIMES THE- RELATIONSHIPS

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:53.944
BETWEEN- THE STATE AGENCIES AND

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.479
LOCALS CAN BE A LITTLE STRANGE

00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:57.114
WHICH IS WHY THIS PROPOSAL-

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:00.217
DOES FOCUS. ON LOCAL CAPACITY

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.419
BUILDING FROM LOCALS AND PEER

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.688
TO PEER LEARNING- WE ALSO WOULD

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.223
JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE IS

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.491
A NEED TO BUILD THIS

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:09.393
INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.329
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING WHEN

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:12.930

FINANCE JUST SAID THEY WOULD

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.537
WORK WITH YOU ON THE

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:21.572
CLARIFICATIONS OF THE CONCERNS

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:23.240
YOU HAVE. AND I WONDERED IF YOU

00:42:23.307 --> 00:42:25.609

00:42:25.676 --> 00:42:26.944
THINK SHOULD BE DONE THIS YEAR

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:29.513

00:42:36.186 --> 00:42:38.489
CO LEAD THIS SB SEVENTY FIVE

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.090
WORK GROUP AND WE DON'T BELIEVE

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.692
THAT ANYTHING. THAT WILL COME

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:42.927
OUT THIS NEXT OCTOBER WILL BE

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.261
ANY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:45.829
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:42:45.896 --> 00:42:47.798
ALREADY WORKING ON WITH OUR

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:50.567
COUNTERPARTS. AT DH CS AND THE

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:52.236
STAKEHOLDERS I WOULD ALSO NOTE.

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.704
THAT AS PART OF THE STATE PLAN

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:55.139
AMENDMENT THAT WAS PASSED LAST

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:56.373
YEAR WERE ALLOWED TO

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.541
RETROACTIVELY BILL FOR FIVE

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.877
YEARS- AND THAT IMPACTS THE

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:01.879
TIMING PEACE. IN OUR ESTIMATION

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.781
ELEAZAR CAN RETROACTIVELY BILL

00:43:03.847 --> 00:43:04.748
FOR FIVE YEARS BUT THAT CLOCK

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:06.250
IS ALREADY TICKING. AND SO WE

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.184
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.419
THAT DOES NEED TO HAPPEN NOW

00:43:08.485 --> 00:43:09.520
AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DOES

STATE FUNDING TO INCREASE WILL

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:29.947

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.381
HOWEVER WE HAVE SEVERAL

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:32.149
CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:34.384
PROPOSAL. FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.786
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LARGELY

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.821
OVERLAPS AND DUPLICATES EITHER

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.323
A SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:40.557

INSTANCE AS FINANCE MENTIONED

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:45.329
IN THIS BUDGET THE GOVERNOR

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.830
PROPOSES TO AUGMENT A SEPARATE

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:49.066
EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS FOR

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.901
COUNTY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS.

00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:52.669
THESE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:54.171
AND THE MATCHING FUNDS SHARE

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.139
MANY SIMILARITIES BOTH ARE

00:47:56.206 --> 00:47:57.608
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS

00:47:57.674 --> 00:47:59.209
TARGETED TO COUNTY SCHOOL

PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE SCHOOL

00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:02.579
BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:03.880
THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE IS

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.048
THAT THE MATCHING FUNDS ARE

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.050
ADMINISTERED BY CD EACH SCHOOLS

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.018
RATHER THAN THROUGH A STATE

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.519
COMMSSION TO COUNTIES AS IS

00:48:09.586 --> 00:48:10.687
THE CASE WITH EXISTING

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.422
PARTNERSHIP GRANTS. HOW THESE

00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:14.224
PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO BE

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.026
CORONATED IS STILL UNCLEAR

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.294
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MATCHING

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:18.762
FUNDS PROPOSAL COULD ALLOW

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.564
DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE GRANTS

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.499
FROM BOTH PROGRAMS.

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.267
ADDITIONALLY PROFESSIONAL

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:24.601
DEVELOPMENT FOCUSED ON STUDENT

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:26.169
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:27.104
WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE MATCHING

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.772
FUNDS THESE ACTIVITIES COULD

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:31.308
ALSO BE FUNDED UNDER OTHER

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:32.876
PENDING PROPOSALS AS WELL.

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:35.245
SECONDLY WE ARE ALSO UNCERTAIN

00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:36.580
IF THE MATCHING FUNDS WOULD

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.248
ULTIMATELY INCREASE COUNTY

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:39.950
SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.685
HEALTH AS INTENDED. THE STATE

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.754
DOESN'T COLLECT DATA ON COUNTY

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.522
SPENDING ON CHILDREN'S SERVICES

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:46.556
MEANING IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:48.392
TO KNOW WHETHER THE PROPOSED

00:48:48.458 --> 00:48:49.593
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOULD MATCH

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.795
NEW COUNTY SPENDING OR WOULD

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.563
MATCH EXISTING FUNDS THAT HAVE

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.098
ALREADY BEEN DEDICATED TO THE

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.301
SERVICE SAYS. LASTLY I THINK WE

00:48:57.367 --> 00:48:58.802
HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS RELATED

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.070
TO THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THIS

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:04.641
PROPOSAL. LARGELY DUE TO THE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.376
LACK OF A LOT AVAILABLE TO. ARE

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.010
STATING IS THAT MY OF THESE DO.

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:08.745
WILL LEFT UP TO. AND THEY-

DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD TO DECIDE.

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:11.581
AND AS A RESULT IT'S UNCLEAR

00:49:11.648 --> 00:49:13.250
HOW THESE APPLICATIONS WOULD BE

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:14.518
PRIORITIZED AND WHAT THE

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.153
ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THIS PROGRAM

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:17.754
WOULD BE. THAT CONCLUDES OUR

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:19.056
INITIAL ASSESSMENTS AND AS I

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:21.191

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.946
THEY PLAN TO EXPAND WITHIN

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.548
THREE YEARS I THINK. TO THE

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:08.550
EXTENT THAT WE HAVE AN INTENT

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.651
TO SERVE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.586
CHILDREN WE CAN'T SAY RIGHT NOW

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.887
WE CERTAINLY HOPE TO EXPAND

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:13.855
THIS PROGRAM A LOT OF THE

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:16.191
INTENT FOR THESE PROPOSALS IS

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.759
TO START SOME OF THESE CAPACITY

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.327
BUILDING MEASURES THAT WE NEED

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:20.395
TO EXPAND TRANSITIONAL

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:21.796
KINDERGARTEN SO THIS IS OUR

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:24.165
FIRST. TAKE OUT THIS WOULD BE

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:25.667
WITH THE PROFESSIONAL

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:27.635
DEVELOPMENT FUNDS AND BE.

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:29.404
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT FUNDS IN THE

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:31.840
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM- SO IN

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.541
TERMS OF OUR LONG TERM PLAN AND

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:35.110
WE KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.711
IS VERY INTERESTED IN EXPANDING

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.680
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:39.748
FOUR YEAR OLDS WE DON'T HAVE A

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.015
NUMBER ON THAT RIGHT NOW PER SE

01:23:41.082 --> 01:23:41.883
BUT WE CERTAINLY ARE VERY

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.685
CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE TAKE UP

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:44.586
WILL BE LIKE AND TO WORK WITH

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.855
OUR- PROGRAMMATIC PARTNERS IN

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.390
OUR LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS. TO

01:23:48.456 --> 01:23:50.558
ADDRESS THE IMPLICATIONS AND

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:51.393
CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.395
MOVING FORWARD. I APPRECIATE

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:55.330
THE FACT THE TERMS TO GETTING

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.499
THE DATA AS YOU GO ALONG. BUT

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.067
IT WOULD REALLY BE NICE TO KNOW

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:00.902
WHAT YOUR LONG TERM GOALS ARE

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:03.738
IN IT AS WITH ANYTHING IF

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.073
THEY'RE MILLION KIDS AND WE'RE

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:07.542
DOING A HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW

01:24:07.609 --> 01:24:08.877
AND I KNOW THAT NUMBERS HIGH. I

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.912
AM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.147
LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:13.882
BY YEAR HOW YOU GET THERE AND

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:14.349
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:17.085
COLLECTING. THE INFORMATION

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:19.721
RETROSPECTIVELY IT AND THEN

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.122
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU'RE

01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:23.024
DOING IT AND I JUST THINK IF

01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:24.292
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THIS

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:27.095
OVER TIME IT BE GOOD TO KNOW

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:27.862
WHAT THE TOTAL UNIVERSITY IS

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:29.531
IN. AND HOW MUCH WE'RE MOVING

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.433
TOWARD IT EVERY YEAR AND WHAT

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:32.967
IT MEANS FOR FUTURE COMMITMENT

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:35.837
SO JUST THAT SOMETHING I WOULD

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:39.140
BE. INTERESTED IN SEEING AS YOU

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:40.575
TALK ABOUT THIS OVER TIME YOU

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:41.576
JUST ANSWERED THE QUESTION BUT

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:44.145
IT IS I THINK IT STILL BEGS THE

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:45.980
ISSUE OF WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.882
OVER TIME AND WHERE. WE'RE

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.818
GOING BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.653
TO THINK ABOUT COMMITMENT OF

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.289
MONEY IF IT'S GOING TO BE THAT

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:59.093
OVER. TIME OF WHAT IT MEANS AND

01:24:59.160 --> 01:24:59.794
WHAT IT'S GOING TOMAIN GO

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:02.297
THERE. THE OTHER. I IS. AND IT

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:04.199
ROUGHER. IN AS WELL. BUT HOW

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.267
THE ADMINISTRATION ENVISIONS

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:08.303
STATE PRESCHOOL AND EARLY T.

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:11.406
CURRY. ALIGNING AND THEN

01:25:11.473 --> 01:25:13.241
ACTUALLY I KNOW WAS ASKED.

01:25:13.308 --> 01:25:17.245
COOPER ALREADY WHY EXPAND. T.

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:19.080
K. AS OPPOSED TO PRESCHOOL-

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:20.882
JUST SO. TALK ABOUT THE

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.217
ALIGNING AND WHY THERE'S A

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:25.820
PREFERENCE FOR ONE OVER THE

01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:26.454
OTHER WOULD WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.923
HEAR- SO I'LL SAY A FEW THINGS

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:32.060
TO THAT AND SO- TO START I

01:25:32.126 --> 01:25:33.194
WOULD NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT

01:25:33.261 --> 01:25:34.596
PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:35.763
STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AT THIS

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:37.165
TIME. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.766
HIGHLIGHT AS WELL THAT WE

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:40.068
REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE MIX

01:25:40.134 --> 01:25:42.103
DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT AGAIN OUR

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.204
OUR CD PARTNERS REALLY

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.039
HIGHLIGHTED- DO SERVE QUITE A

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.407
FEW FOUR YEAR OLD ARE STILL A

01:25:46.474 --> 01:25:49.477
REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:49.978
MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.446
PROVIDING. PRESCHOOL

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:52.747
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOUR YEAR

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.716
OLDS- SO THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:56.417
POINT AND THEN TO GET TO YOUR

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.620
QUESTION ABOUT WHY TRANSITIONAL

01:25:58.686 --> 01:25:59.320
KINDERGARTEN OVER STATE

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:01.189
PRESCHOOL- AGAIN THE

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:02.557
ADMINISTRATION IS VERY

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:04.993
INTERESTED IN PROVIDING. IN

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:06.594
EXPANDING ACCESS FOR

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:07.929
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.797
ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS. WE

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:10.965
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A FEW

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.500
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT WE

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:13.868
COULD TAKE. THE TRANSITIONAL

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.770
KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL REALLY

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.206
ALIGNS WITH DATA THAT HAS COME

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:20.208
OUT FROM THE MASTER PLAN WITH

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:20.975
THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:26:21.042 --> 01:26:23.278
POLICY. OF FEATURES OF THE

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.345
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:25.847
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS CHILDREN TO

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.982
BE IN NEXT INCOME CLASSROOMS-

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:30.018
THAT THAT IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:31.719
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:34.222
SO. THERE ARE FEW FEATURES OF

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:36.090
TKA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.059
WANTS TO LOK INTO AND EXPAND-

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:39.327
AND THAT'S NOT AT THE EXPENSE

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.395
OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THE

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.096
STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM

01:26:42.163 --> 01:26:45.500
PROVIDES FOR THE FIELD- SINCE.

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:47.635
AND LET ME JUST GIVE A CHANCE

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:48.836
FOR EITHER THE L. A. OVER THE

01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:50.371
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:53.074
COMMENT ON WHAT WAS JUST SAID

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:54.709
KELLY- DO YOU HAVE ANY THING TO

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.211
HAND- AND ALSO I HAD TO GET A

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:59.647
MAY STATEMENT ABOUT- WHAT CAN

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.049
REPROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:02.617
MONSTER EXPAND ALTERNATELY

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:03.718
DEPENDS ON ITS OWN SPECIFIC

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.453
GOALS. I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.854
THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO OFFER

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.590
A ONE YEAR PUBLIC SCHOOL OF

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:09.457
PUBLIC PRESCHOOL TO ALL

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.659
STUDENTS. ON THE G. K. COULD BE

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:12.961
A BETTER PATH TO EXPANSION

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:14.195
BECAUSE THE STATE COULD USE

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:15.630
SCHOOL DISTRICT CATCHMENT AREAS

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.432
AS A WAY TO ENSURE. THAT ALL

01:27:17.498 --> 01:27:18.833
ELIGIBLE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.435
TO PRESCHOOL- IF THE

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:21.536
LEGISLATURE WANTED TO OFFER

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:23.004
PRESCHOOL TO ALL THREE FOUR

01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:23.538
YEAR OLD FROM LOW INCOME

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:24.973
FAMILIES AND STATE PRESCHOOL

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.074
COULD BE A BETTER PATH TO

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:31.746
EXPANSION. STATE I'M SO THOSE

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:32.347
AREJUST SOME OF THE

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:34.082
CONSIDERATIONS- THAT WE RATES

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:36.050
WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:38.086
THINKING ABOUT KIND OF WHAT

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:40.321
WHAT THE PAST EXPANSION AS-

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.056
THANK YOU AND DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:44.792
EDUCATION ANYTHING TO ADD. YES

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.260
THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARK AND

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:47.261
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:49.263
EDUCATION WE JUST WANNA ADAM

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:50.765
BALDOCK WITH BOTH OF THIS THERE

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:52.333
IS IT'S ALWAYS THE STAIRS DOWN

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:54.902
EARLY AND I HAVE ALREADY STATED

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.037
THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.439
STANDS BEHIND MIXED INCOME IN

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:01.376
SETTING. AND SO REGARDLESS

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:02.877
SEVENTY TWO YEARS THE S. B. P.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:04.112
WE THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:06.347
TO ADDRESS AND THAT NEED TO

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.216
HAVE MIXED INCOME AS WELL AS

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:09.484
ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN WITH

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.085
DISABILITIES COULD BE INCLUDED

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:11.953
SO THAT THEY'RE IN NOT

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.756
INCLUSIVE ATTY SO IN ADDITION

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:16.524
TO LOOKING UP OF WORLD WE WANT

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:17.959
TO STRESS THAT THAT MASTER DATA

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:19.994
DROPS THE THREE YEAR OLDS. IN

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.829
NOT EXPANSION OF CST KEY TO

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:23.131
INCLUDE ALL CHILDREN WITH

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:24.699
DISABILITIES AND WE WOULD

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:27.235
HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN GOING BACK

TO ENSURING THAT CHILDREN WHO

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.671
HAD I AT THIS EASIER

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:31.105
INDIVIDUALIZED FAMILY SERVICE

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:34.409
PLANS WHICH GO UP TO AGE THREE

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:36.344
COULD ALSO PARTICIPATE A LOT OF

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:36.911
THE CHILDREN AS THEY

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:40.948
TRANSITION. I GAVE. THAN AREN'T

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.817
ELIGIBLE FOR IDA KIRBY WHICH IS

WHAT STARTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:46.120
SYSTEM AT AGE THREE AND SO IF

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.022
WE WANTED TO ADDRESS MORE MORAL

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.992
GROUND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:53.327
