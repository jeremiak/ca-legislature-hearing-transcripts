ESSENTIAL TO THEIR SURVIVAL.

WELL OVER 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:54.967
FOUR THOUSAND WINERIES ARE

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:58.270
EXTREMELY SMALL AND SHE MORE OR

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:01.540
LESS TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DIRECT

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:03.108

SMALL BOUTIQUE WINERIES IN

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:20.359

TWO THOUSAND FIVE GRAND HOME

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:23.629
SEASON. THE THIS SEGMENT OF THE

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.631
WINE INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA HAS HAS

00:19:25.697 --> 00:19:27.566
LITERALLY EXPLODED TO THE POINT-

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:30.936
LIKE I MENTONED WE HAVE ALMOST

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:31.470
FOUR THOUSAND WINERIES IN

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:33.505
CALIFORNIA. ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.807
TO NOTE ON AND IT'S- BUT I THINK

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.576
SENATOR ALLEN BROUGHT THIS UP-

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.611
THIS ABILITY TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:43.348
CONSUMERS- WAS A VITAL LIFELINE

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.650
FOR SMALL LINERS TO SURVIVE

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:46.885
DURING THAT. ACADEMIC THEY'D

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:49.488
LITERALLY WHATEVER HI JUST IT

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:50.789
WOULD HAVE BEEN UGLY OUT THERE

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.624
MANY WINERIES WHAT ABOUT TO SHUT

00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.726
SHUT THEIR DOORS- BUT FOR THE

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.695
STABILITY AND IT REALLY. I JUST

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.363
CAN'T EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.200
THAT WAS TO THEIR SURVIVAL.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:02.801
DURING DURING THESE DIFFICULT

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:05.537
TIMES- IT ALSO- CREATED SHOULD

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.673
LEAD TO SOME NEW CREATIVE

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:09.808
APPROACHES TO SELLING WINE- THAT

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.109
AGAIN LIKE CINDERELLA MENTIONED

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:14.179
I GUESS- NOW IT IS VERY COMMON

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:15.747
FOR WINERIES OFFER VIRTUAL WINE

00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:17.683
TASTINGS. FOR EXAMPLE WHERE YOU

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:19.251
HAVE ONE SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:21.053
CONSUMER THEY WILL GET ONLINE

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.655
MUCH LIKE WE ARE TODAY AND THE-

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.058
WINEMAKER OR PERHAPS TO GET SOME

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:27.859
OF THE ACTION WALK THEM THROUGH-

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.528
THE TASTINGS AND GIVE THEM-

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.430
EXPERIENCE VERY SIMILAR TO BEING

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:35.100
ABLE TO VISIT THE WIND. BY

00:20:35.167 --> 00:20:36.368
WINERY DIRECTLY. ALSO I WAS

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:37.869
ASKED TO SPEAK LITTLE BIT AS TO

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:39.571
THE LOGISTICS ABOUT HOW DIRECT

00:20:39.638 --> 00:20:42.541
TO CONSUMER- WHEN SHIPPING WORKS

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:45.611
FOR WINERIES. FOR MOST WINERIES%

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:49.147
THE NORMAL APPROACH IS TO USE-

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:51.850
TO HANDLE THIS PRIVILEGE THROUGH

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.486
THE USE OF TWO DIFFERENT- TYPES

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.388
OF THIRD PARTY COMPANIES. THE

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.557
FIRST IS ESSENTIALLY A

00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:00.659
COMPLIANCE COMPANY THAT IS

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:02.861
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.230
APPROPRIATE LICENSES- ARE IN

00:21:05.297 --> 00:21:07.466
PLACE AND TAXES ARE ARE

00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:09.635
COLLECTED- CAUSES I'M SURE

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:10.936
YOU'RE AWARE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.505
ABHORRENT OF. WINE SHIPPING LAWS

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.440
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT MUST BE

00:21:15.507 --> 00:21:17.776
NAVIGATED. FRANKLY BEYOND THE

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.144
ABILITY OF MOST SMALL WINERIES

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:22.047
TO DO THAT THEMSELVES- AND IT'S

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.749
FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON THAT

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.984
THESE ARE COMPANIES EXIST. AND

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:28.820
ALSO OF COURSE TAX RATES BERRY-

00:21:28.887 --> 00:21:30.722
YOU KNOW NOT ONLY IN OBVIOUSLY

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.557
CALIFORNIA- JURISDICTIONS BUT

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.493
ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE TAKE

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.595
VERY SERIOUSLY- OUR

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:37.996
RESPONSIBILITY TO COLLECT THE

00:21:38.063 --> 00:21:39.698
APPROPRIATE TAXES AND THE USE OF

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.500
THESE TOP INSULTS INSURE. THAT

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.186
IS THAT STATES HAVE LAWS THAT

ARE OKAY IN OTHER STATES. OR

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.389
EVEN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WOULD

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.691
ALLOW THEM. TO GO DIRECT TO

COUNTRIES. I DON'T THINK SO BUT

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.605
THAT'S WHAT I SAID I WISH I DO

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:23.241

THROUGH THE THREE TIER

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WHICH ALSO

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:49.006

THE NUMBER OF CASES TO BE

00:41:57.147 --> 00:41:58.883
PROFITABLE THROUGH DISTRIBUTION

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.417
IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND ALSO

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:01.452
CHALLENGING IF THERE'S NO BRAND

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:03.654

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:03.673
ALSO UNTRUE- YOU KNOW REMEMBER

THERE ARE NOW OVER TWO THOUSAND

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.310

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.287
DOES IS CREATE AN UNNECESSARY

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:20.389
BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE AN

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:21.023
ARTIFICIAL BARRIER TO DIRECT TO

BEING SHIPPED. WHICH IS THE

01:04:29.498 --> 01:04:31.534
MANUFACTURER. AND WHEN IT COMES

WILL REMIT TAXES THAT ARE OWED

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:39.108
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE FOLLOWING THE

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.776
SAME INTERSTATE PROCESS THAT

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:43.045

YEARS OF CREDIBILITY AND

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:53.889
GOODWILL. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.992
QUITE FRANKLY OFFENSIVE TO US-

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.793

THEN DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO

01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:03.733
CONSUMER. IS JUST AS SAFE AND

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:04.533
HOW IT'S HANDLED TODAY. THE

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.801
TRUTH IS THERE ARE LAWS ON THE

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.003
BOOKS TO CATCH STOP LOSS AND

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.805

ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:12.541
OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT'S GONNA

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:14.343
COST MORE BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:15.511
GOING TO COST AS MUCH AS THE

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.812
INCREASED BROCK PROCEED TO

WORK THAT THEY OFTEN RECOMMEND.

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:22.184
SO THE BOTTOM LINE FOR KENTUCKY

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:24.387
IS DTC HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:26.322

THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT. AND IT

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.774
TENDS TO GET OVERSIMPLIFIED. THE

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:47.809
FACT IS IT'S NOT A VERY SIMPLE

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.378

WHAT CAN BE SOLD ARE YOU ALL

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.288
EVERY SINGLE QUESTION AND- AND

01:31:00.354 --> 01:31:01.823
THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.491
IT FOR A LONG TIME WE'VE SETTLED

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.393
ON A SYSTEM THAT DOES WORK.

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.228
OTHER THREE TIER SYSTEM IT HAS A

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.963
LOT OF BENEFITS FOR THE INDUSTRY

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.299

EXISTENCE OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER-

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.756
OUTSIDE OF THAT STATE REGULATORY

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.992
SYSTEM IT DOES DIRECTLY

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.627

STATE IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:07.941
YOU KNOW. AGAIN I THINK THE

IN THAT COULD BE IDENTIFIED. ARE

01:54:28.027 --> 01:54:29.796
ACTUALLY LEGAL IT DOESN'T MEAN-

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:32.198
BECAUSE- THERE WAS NO WAY FOR

01:54:32.265 --> 01:54:33.866
THOSE BUSINESSES TO GET LICENSES

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:35.268
THAT THEY CHOSE NOT TO GET A

PRODUCTS THAT WE WILL DISTRIBUTE

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:52.791

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:55.293
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:57.295
LEGISLATION- HELPING THEM TO

02:13:57.362 --> 02:14:01.967
GROW. HOWEVER ALLOWING LARGE OUT

02:14:02.033 --> 02:14:04.002
OF STATE SELLERS TO SHIP

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:05.170
DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:07.305
CALIFORNIA IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT

02:14:27.225 --> 02:14:29.161
IMPORTANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION.

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:31.229
BETWEEN OUR SMALL CALIFORNIA

02:14:31.296 --> 02:14:32.497
