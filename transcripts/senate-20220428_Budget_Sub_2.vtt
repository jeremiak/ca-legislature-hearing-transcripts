PROPOSAL AND THAT PROVIDES ALL

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.811
OF THOSE AND YOU SERVE A LIST OF

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:25.978
ALL THE THINGS WE CONSIDERED AS

00:07:26.045 --> 00:07:27.713
PART OF A BUDGET TEAM PROPOSAL.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.748
AND THEN FOR THESE REVENUE BONDS

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:30.550
TYPICALLY THERE ARE YOU KNOW

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:31.784
INDIVIDUAL PROPOSALS THAT ARE

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:37.456
THAT ARE PUT. FORWARD TO THE

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:38.624
LEGISLATURE SO. WE NOW THEY'RE

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.725
SEEN AS THE PEASY AND THEN

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.594
THERE'S LANGUAGE INCLUDE IN. BY

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:43.429
BILL AND SO I THINK EVEN. HAS

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:44.997
BEEN- THE THAT DOES TAKE THE-

00:07:45.064 --> 00:07:46.132
TIME FOR THEM TO COMPILE. TIME

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.733
AND THEN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.569
TECHNICAL WORK ON ON THEIR END.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.903
WE THINK CERTAINLY THAT THE

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:51.971
CONCEPT OF STREAMLINING THAT

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:54.740
PROCESS AND NOT WORK AND YOU

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.676
KNOW HAS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:57.677
AND THERE IS WE DO RECOGNIZE

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:58.978
THERE IS. SUBSTANTIAL WORK ON

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.179
THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:02.548
AND IN DOING THAT I'M AND THAT

00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:03.983
IN SOME CASES THESE REALLY ARE

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.918
JUST TECHNICAL NON CONTROVERSIAL

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.320
REVERBERATIONS EXTENSION

00:08:07.386 --> 00:08:10.323
BASICALLY OF ONE OF SPENDING.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.158
FORTY OR AUTHORIZATIONS RIVER

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.993
FRIENDS I'M SPEAKING IN GENERAL

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.895
THAT'S REASONABLE HOWEVER WE DO

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:17.864
RECOGNIZE THAT- THE JOINT

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.931
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.668
PROCESS- ISN'T PERHAPS THE MOST

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:25.037
AND- THE MOST WELL SUITED TO

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.806
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND IT'S

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.040
NOT. SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.809
PUBLIC PROCESS AND IT'S NOT

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.011
SOMETHING THAT- FIGHT IS EASY

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:33.546
FOR FOLKS TO AND MISTER SEA

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.114
WHAT'S GOING ON AND SERVE

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.183
OVERSEAS SO WE DO THINK IT'S

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.886
REALLY IMPORTANT AND- TO ONLY

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.754
USE IT FOR THOSE TECHNICAL. AND

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.122
NON CONTROVERSIAL ITEMS AND

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.490
REALLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:45.791
LEGISLATORS COMFORTABLE WITH

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:48.160
WITH THIS EXPANSION- AND ALSO TO

00:08:48.227 --> 00:08:49.896
MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.998
HAS ENOUGH TIME AND INFORMATION.

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:53.165
TO REALLY FACILITATE ITS REVIEWS

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:56.035
SO WE HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS-

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.169
BUT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.738
FROM MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE I

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:05.278
HAVE. TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:05.912
CONSIDERATIONS. THE FIRST THING

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:06.679
IS THE LEGISLATURE READ SHOULD.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:07.780
WHETHER IT COMFORTABLE. HAVING

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:10.082
THIS LIKE A FIVE TO OF THE REFER

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.218
. AND REVERSION ON FOR. GENERAL

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:13.586
THE BONDS IN AND THESE ARE ABOUT

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.155
THE THAT THE NAME. THIS IS FOR

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:19.392
HER- TO AND I ACTUALLY NOT OF

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:22.595
YOUR MIND AND MANY. ANYWHERE DID

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.697
YOU BUY AND ALL THESE REVENUE.

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:27.300
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENTLY FROM

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:28.768
TO YOU- SO WE WORK LET'S JUST

00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:31.337
CAN WHETHER COME WITH APPROACH.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.940
OR WOULD LIKE TO WOMEN FOR A- WE

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.741
KNOW THEY'RE BEING. STATE KINDS

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:37.376
RELATED TO PRISON CRISIS- IN A

00:09:37.443 --> 00:09:39.745
PATH- AND- THERE'S A LOT OF

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.315
ACTIVITY IT RICH REGARD TO

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:42.848
PRISONS- AND THE POTENTIAL

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:44.517
CLOSURE PRESENTS SO THAT'S BEEN

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.618
AN AREA WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:53.993
LEGISLATURE. HAS HAS- HE HAD A

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.895
PARTICULAR INTEREST IN TO. IN

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:57.663
ADDITIONAL. OF THAT'S THE CASE

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.231
ON THE CASE OF PROJECTS BE X.

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:02.168
FROM. PROCESS IF WORKS AN THE

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.369
WISH OF THE LEISURE. UNDER OTHER

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:06.038
WAY FOR VERY LARGE- FINE

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:07.506
APPROPRIATIONS COULD BE EXCLUDED

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.375
. OR AN YOU KNOW. THAT HAVE

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.077
RECEIVED. REPORTS THERE AT COULD

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.945
BE TO THEIR- DAY OPTIONS THERE

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:14.880
BUT WE DO WANNA MAKE SURE.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:15.915
LEGISLATURES REALLY- HAVE

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:16.916
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT IT RIGHT OR

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.218
ARE WHETHER THERE'S CASES. THAT

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.088
IT'S NOT WITH. THE SECOND-

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:22.989
RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE IS THAT

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:24.190
THE LEGISLATURE. THE TINY AND

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:25.658
WHETHER WANTS TO PROVIDE ANY

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.728
LIMIT TO ON MANY NOTICES INCOME

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.729
FOR. SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.664
SOME HAPPEN IS. ON THE

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.065
LEGISLATURE BOTH MEMBERS AND

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:33.599
STAFF AND GET A LIFE GET

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:36.035
REQUESTS RIGHT AT THE END OF THE

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:36.836
BUDGET PROCESS. AND THINGS ARE

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.204
SO BUSY THAT IT'S REALLY

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.805
DIFFICULT AND WITH THE OTHER

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:41.841
COMPETING WORK LED TO DO THAT

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.542
DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:44.810
IDEAL. ON SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:45.878
AND SO ONE THING AND THAT THE

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:47.213
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:48.748
WHETHER IT WANTS TO REQUIRE THAT

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.416
THESE. NOTIFICATIONS COME

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:52.418
FORWARD BEFORE MAY FIRST AND

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:52.985
THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:55.388
LEGISLATURE HAVE A LITTLE BIT A

00:10:55.454 --> 00:10:56.822
LITTLE BIT OF TIME BEFORE THE IN

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:58.691
THE BUDGET PROCESS TO REVIEW

00:10:58.758 --> 00:10:59.625
THEM. AND FINALLY- WORK IN THE

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:01.027
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER WHETHER IT

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:02.762
WANTS TO REQUIRE AS PART OF THE

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:04.363
LANGUAGE- ANY SPECIFIC

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.532
INFORMATION BE REQUIRED SO WE-

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:07.633
WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.502
ADMINISTRATION AND- HAS IT HAS

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.038
EXPRESSED ITS INTENT TO PROVIDE

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:13.105
DETAILED INFORMATION IN A

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.373
SPREADSHEET ON THE THREE

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.574
CORPORATIONS MAKING THAT'S

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:17.309
REALLY VALUABLE. BUT WE THINK

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.644
THAT IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE TO

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.280
MEMORIALIZE THAT IN AND IN

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:23.549
LANGUAGE- AS PART OF THE CONTROL

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.184
SECTION THAT WAY YOU KNOW AS-

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.286
AND- TIME MOVES FORWARD

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.154
DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE IN

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.522
POSITIONS- YOU KNOW THINGS

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:32.625
CHANGE- WELL I'LL BE CLEAR. ON

00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:34.960
WHAT'S EXPECTED AS PART OF THESE

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:36.362
NOTIFICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:36.929
LEGISLATURE REALLY GET THE

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:38.531
INFORMATION THAT IT NEEDS TO

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:39.965
MAKE. MAKE SURE YOU THOSE-

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:40.966
REQUESTING THAT THEY REALLY

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:50.176
BEGAN OUR TECHNICAL- AND. AND

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.544
ARE NOT CONTROVERSIAL. I'M HAPPY

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.579
TO TAKE ANY PART. FORGET THIS

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:54.980
MISTER HALL MISS US YEAR TROW.

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.550
GREEN HE GOT JOINT BUDGETCOMMITTEE. RATHER THAN THIS

00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:59.085
COMMITTEE SO WE- WITH SORT OF A

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.754
DEGREE. WHAT THE EXTENSIONS. ON

00:12:01.821 --> 00:12:04.557
WOULD BE- AS- BEEN IN THIS IDEA

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:06.659
THE MAIN. I CAN AND- IF KNOW THE

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.627
TECH LANGUAGE IS OFF SOMETIMES I

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.529
DON'T KNOW ON THE MONEY IF YOU

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:13.132
GET A NEED TO REVERSE AND THEY

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:13.833
THEY'RE IT'S SORT OF CLOSE. AT I

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.569
RECALL AS WE DO THIS EVERY YEAR

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.037
WE GET TO. JUNE AND THEY THEY'RE

00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.405
NOT GONNA BE ABLE CLOSE OUT THE

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.606
BIGGEST THING ONE EXTENSION.

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.008
JUST AS THE FINISH UP STUFF. YOU

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:23.576
GUYS HAVE A COMMENT ON THE

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:27.446
ALEJO'S- SUGGESTED

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:32.918
RECOMMENDATIONS. ONCE YOU. WE

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.220
CERTAINLY WANT TO BE. WE

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.554
CERTAINLY WANT TO BE WITH THIS

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.624
PROCESS I'M AND YOU KNOW THE

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:39.725
INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:40.826
WE'RE PROVIDING A SUFFICIENT

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:43.562
LEVEL OF- INFORMATION AND SO. TO

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:46.799
BE CLEAR RIGHT NOW WE START WITH

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.934
A VERY BROAD AND DETAILED BOND

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:49.802
SPREAD SHEET WHERE WE WORK WITH

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.470
OUR BOND COORDINATORS AND

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:53.172
DEPARTMENTS EACH YEAR. AND

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:54.507
THAT'S SORT OF THE INFORMATION

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:56.041
THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:57.710
CONSOLIDATED DOWN. IT'S USUALLY

00:12:57.776 --> 00:12:59.645
INCLUDED AS BACK UP UPON YOUR

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:02.548
REQUEST I AM FOR THESE ISSUES.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.617
AND SO UNDER THIS PROCESS WE

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.118
WOULD BASICALLY TAKE THAT EXACT

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.887
SAME LEVEL OF INFORMATION.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.555
ACTUALLY I THINK IN THIS CASE IT

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.890
MIGHT EVEN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:13.159
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDING

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:13.792
A FEW I AM COLUMNS THAT WOULD

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:16.328
THAT WOULD GIVE YOU ESTIMATED RE

00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:17.663
APPROPRIATIONS. I'M AND THAT

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.531
WOULD JUST GO THROUGH A

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.232
DIFFERENT PROCESS SO. WE

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.734
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THERE TO BE

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.968
A PERCEPTION THAT WORD PROVIDING

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:24.703
LESS INFORMATION OR THAT WE'RE

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.006
BEING LESS TRANSPARENT BECAUSE

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.407
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.410
DO IT ALL. I'M AND- YOUR POINT

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.946
YES THAT SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:35.848
AS HELPFUL THAT. REALLY AS WE

00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.683
GET NEARER TOWARDS THE END OF

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.286
SOME OF THESE OLDER BONDS I AM

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:42.087
THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE YOU KNOW.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:43.455
BECOMES A SMALL ENOUGH AMOUNT

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:45.925
WHERE SOMETHING- AS SIMPLE AS

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.227
EMPLOYEE COMPOUND RETIREMENT

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:49.295
ADJUSTMENTS THAT HIT IN THE

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:51.030
CURRENT YEAR. CAN ACTUALLY

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:52.932
SQUEEZE SOME OF YOUR OUTER YEARS

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:54.667
TO THE POINT WHERE WE MIGHT NEED

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:56.535
TO REVERT UP TO NINE THOUSAND

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:58.103
DOLLARS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.538
THAT YOU KNOW A CERTAIN PART OF

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:02.741
THAT WAS NOT. OVER ALLOCATED.

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:04.577
AND SO WE REALLY DO LOVE AT THE

TO BRING THAT ISSUE IS AND ALSO

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:58.583
JUST HOW WIDESPREAD THAT IS SO

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.018
IS THAT REALLY JUST RELATED TO

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.320
THIS ONE CAMPUS THAT HAD

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:02.921
SIGNIFICANT BUILDING. PROGRAM

AND HAD SOMEONE RETIREES IS A

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.091
MORE WIDESPREAD ISSUE AND SO

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:07.892
THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:11.062
NOT CLEAR A TAD- WHETHER A NEW

DEDICATED UNIT AS IS PROPOSED IS

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:14.366
REALLY THE MOST APPROPRIATE

00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:16.301
APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. THE

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:18.770
ISSUES IF ANY- BETTER IF THEY

00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:21.639
ARE SIGNIFICANT YOU SEE- YES YES

00:27:21.706 --> 00:27:22.907
HI DELEGATED AUTHORITY FOR QUITE

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:25.010
SOME TIME SO WHILE THE STATUTORY

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.778
AUTHORITY UNDERPINNING THIS IMHO

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.813
YOU IT'S FROM TWO THOUSAND AND

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.614
TEN OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.516
YOU SEE IS HAD THIS DELEGATED

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:32.784
AUTHORITY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.219
FOUR. SO IT'S BEEN ALMOST THIRTY

00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:36.321
YEARS THAT YOU SEE IS HAD THIS

00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:43.828
DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO DO THESE-

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:44.729
INSPECTIONS AT THEIR CAMPUSES.

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:47.232
SO- IT IS IT'S ON THAT WHETHER

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:50.001
YOU KNOW WHAT. IT A REALLY. SORT

00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:51.669
OF THE SECOND LAYER ISN'T IT IS

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:52.937
THE APPROACH MIGHT BE- BUT THERE

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.073
COULD BE A THINGS COULD BE CAN.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.908
I SO YOU KNOW WE ALSO. THAT ONE

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:57.909
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU OUR

00:27:57.976 --> 00:28:00.011
REVIEW CAME UP AS WE DID TALK TO

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.980
YOU SEE- AND HAD SOME

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:02.747
CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU SEE AND

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:04.749
THEY RAISED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:05.550
ABOUT THE PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW. IN

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:06.851
THEIR MINDS IF THEY DIDN'T FEEL

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.787
IT BUT IT WAS WARRANTED IS WHAT

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.522
WE HEARD IN ME WE HEARD THAT

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:11.790
THEIR CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:13.391
DUPLICATIVE. I'M AND IT WOULD

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:14.993
TAKE ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.828
ON THEIR PART TO STUDENTS TODAY

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:18.930
TO- BE INVOLVED IN IN THIS SORT

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:21.566
OF. PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE THIS

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.134
EXTRA LAYER FOR THEM SO THAT

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:24.769
THAT WAS WHAT WE HEARD FROM

00:28:24.836 --> 00:28:26.538
THEM. AGAIN WE DON'T YOU KNOW I

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.239
THINK THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.474
KNOW AND SO FAR RIGHT THE

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.475
RATIONALE FOR URBAN REJECTING AT

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.477
THIS TIME IS TO GIVE EVERYONE A

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:33.912
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO THINK

00:28:33.978 --> 00:28:35.447
ISRAEL WE'RE- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:36.915
APRIL THE END OF APRIL. ALMOST

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:39.150
MAY- YOU KNOW AS THE COMMITTEE

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.752
WELL KNOWS THIS THE END OF THIS

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.854
PROCESS GOES SO QUICKLY- AND SO

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.122
WE THINK THAT IF THE

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:44.789
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO COME

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.724
BACK IN JANUARY THAT WOULD GIVE

00:28:46.791 --> 00:28:47.792
THEM MORE TIME TO PROVIDE AN

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:49.294
ADDITIONAL AN- ADDITIONAL

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.129
RATIONALE. IT'LL ALSO GIVE SOME

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.664
ADDITIONAL TIME TO WORK WITH YOU

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.400
SEE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.368
THE CONCERNS THAT THEY RAISED

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:58.670
ARE MERITORIOUS- WERE NOT.

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:00.004

CORRIDORS AND CONNECTIVITY. SO

00:47:33.884 --> 00:47:35.519
IN THE PAST I'VE HAD MOMENTS

00:47:35.586 --> 00:47:37.588
WHERE WE'VE HAD GREAT IDEAS BUT

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:39.890

CAPACITY TO GET MORE OF THESE

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:46.964
TYPES OF PROJECTS DONE. BUT IT'S

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.765
AN INCENTIVE BASED APPROACH SO

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:51.301
IT FITS WELL BOTH IN THE SENSE

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.103
