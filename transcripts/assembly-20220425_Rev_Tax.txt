WILL ALLOW OWNERS SO WHO ARE LOSING THEIR PROPERTY BECAUSE OF- UNPAID TAXES THE CHANCELLOR TO RECOVER ANY EQUITY THEY HAVE IN THE HOME. THERE IS SOME. EIGHT WITNESSES WEAKNESS- IN CALIFORNIA SO LAW THAT ALLOWS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SO TO SIMPLY SALAS THE SEAS THAT TAXES ARE THE LINK WITH DELINQUENT THE PROPERTY TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES SO ALL PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS ARE. FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING. IN THIS CASE IS UP NO ACCESS TO PROCEEDS ARE GENERATED- ALSO THE FORMER OWNER RECEIVES P NO COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF- HOW MUCH EQUITY WAS UP IN THE HOME- I HOPE BUT I HAVE- TO SUPPORT WITNESSES- JOSH PORK WITH THE PACIFIC THAT LEGAL FOUNDATION AND THE SCOTT. KAUFMAN WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PRIMARY WITNESSES INCH SUPPORT PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON- HELLO EVERYONE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR IRWIN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION MY NAME IS JOSH WILL PULL AND I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION- PLF IS THE NATION'S OLDEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL FREEDOM BASED LEGAL ORGANIZATION- IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE'RE DEDICATED TO PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS FROM GOVERNMENT OVERREACH THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ADDRESS THE EGREGIOUS PRACTICE WE'VE LABELED HOME EQUITY THEFT AND ALLOW ME TO TESTIFY ON THE ISSUE. IN THE U. S. ABOUT A DOZEN STATES ALLOW TAXING AGENCY OR PRIVATE TAX LIEN INVESTOR TO FORECLOSE ON A TAX DEFAULTED PROPERTY AND TAKE ABSOLUTE TITLE REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX DAY AND THE AMOUNT OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THIS IS RESULTED AND A AN APPALLING LOSS OF HOMES AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF PROPERTY EQUITY BEYOND THE GRIEVOUS COST THE TAXPAYERS EQUITY THEFT IS ALSO UNCONSTITUTIONAL EQUITY THE FINANCIAL INTEREST A PERSON HAS IN THEIR PROPERTY AFTER SATISFYING ALL DEBTS IS AS MUCH A FORMER PROPERTY AS LAND OR BUILDINGS EQUITY REPRESENTS HOW MUCH A PERSON HAS INVESTED IN THE PROPERTY AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF WEALTH HELD BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BECAUSE EQUITY IS A RECOGNIZED PROPERTY INTEREST THE FIFTH AMENDMENT DICTATES THAT IT CANNOT BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE THAT INCLUDES TAXATION WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION TO THE OWNER ULTIMATELY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT TAKES MORE THAN IT'S OWED AND MUST PAY THE FORMER OWNER FOR THE EXCESS PROPERTY VALUE OR SELL THE PROPERTY TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER IN RETURN THE EXCESS PROCEEDS TO THE FORMER- OWNER. THAT OBLIGATION IS AS OLD AS THE MAGNA CARTA. AND FAILURE TO SATISFY THAT OBLIGATION IS A VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. TO ITS CREDIT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROTECTS EQUITY IN ORDINARY TAX SALES UNDER CHAPTER SEVEN OF THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE COUNTIES MAY PUT TAX DEFAULTED PROPERTY UP FOR AUCTION. TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER IN ANY MONEY RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THE TAX DEBT AND ITS STATUTORY INTEREST AND FEES- IS THEN RETURNED TO. THAT PEOPLE WHO HOLD INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY INCLUDING THE PROPERTY OWNER. IN THESE CASES THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IS PRESERVED AND THE CONSTITUTION IS SATISFIED HOWEVER THERE IS. A LOOPHOLE IN THE REVENUE AND TAXATION COKE% CHAPTER EIGHT ALLOWS A GOVERNMENT BODY OR PUBLIC INTEREST GROUP DEVELOPING LOW INCOME HOUSING. TO JUST SKIP THE PUBLIC AUCTION AND PURCHASE THE PROPERTY OUT RIGHT FOR A MINIMUM- SEE. NO EXCESS PROCEEDS RATED AND THE FORMER OWNER HASNO RIGHT TO REQUEST THE REMAINING EQUITY VALUE IS JUST COMPENSATION. THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. OF COURSE TAX COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA. COUNTIES RELY ON PROPERTY TAX REVENUES TO OPERATE AND CANNOT BE LEFT WITHOUT RECOURSE WHEN PEOPLE FAIL TO PAY THEIR DEBTS. HOWEVERTHE COLLECTION MECHANISM SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO TAKE. AND KEEP MORE THAN WHAT'S OWED IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT THAT WOULD BE CALLED AFTER. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEIZE EQUITY TO SATISFY SMALLER TAX DEBTS ARE PLAYING WITH FIRE BECAUSE WHEN COURTS GET INVOLVED THEY'LL LIKELY HAVE TO PAY BACK. THE EQUITY VALUE THAT WAS TAKEN. AND TO BE CLEAR CLOSING THE CHAPTER EIGHT LOOPHOLE. LEGISLATIVELY WOULD NOT SUBJECT COUNTIES TO ADDITIONAL LIABILITY IN FACT IT WOULD DO THE OPPOSITE. BY CURBING FUTURE WRONGS AND PROTECTING COUNTIES FROM ADDITIONAL LIABILITY. IT WOULD ONLY HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON COUNTY OFFICIALS BECAUSE THE DEFAULT MECHANISM IS ALREADY A SALE. AT AN AUCTION TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND THE RETURN OF PROCEEDS TO THOSE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY. ULTIMATELY BY ELIMINATING EQUITY THEFT ALL PARTIES INCLUDING THE TAXPAYERS AND THE TAXING AGENCIES ARE MADE WHOLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS. RIGHT TO US THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON TOP OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS THERE IN SUPPORT OF THE SPIRIT OF THE BILL AND WE DON'T SEE THIS HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA- THE CONCERN THAT THEY HAVE RAISED- SO WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AND THE- FRANKLY ALREADY COMPLY WITH THE SPIRIT SO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY. AND AS THE PRIMARY YOUR SCOTT THE WAY YEAH RIGHT THE LATE SO. HEY WE HAVE TWO MINUTES. TO MAKE IT BETTER- AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE CLOSE THE LOOP ON CALIFORNIA'S TACTICAL THE PROPERTY SALES CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING THANK YOU. WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION OF SEIZE TAX TO INCOME PROPERTY WHEN IT IS SOLD TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS WERE GALLO INCOME HOUSING. CHAPTER EIGHT APART SIX OF DIVISION ONE COMPANY TAXATION REVENUE CODE ALLOWS PUBLIC AGENCIES TAX AGENCIES AN ELIGIBLE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE TACTICAL THE PROPERTY BY SUBMIT YOUR REQUEST FOR PURCHASE OR OBJECTING TO THE SALE OF PROPERTY SCHEDULE FOR PUBLIC AND OR SEALED AUCTIONS. IN THESE CASES NO EXCESS PROCEEDS ARE GENERATED SO THE FORMER OWNER RECEIVES NO COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF EQUITY. AB FIVE THREE NINE WOULD ENSURE THAT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR SEIZE PROPERTY BY REQUIRING THESE PROPERTIES. FIRST BE OFFERED FOR SALE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF CHAPTER SEVEN. TWO GREAT ATTENTION THAT THEY WOULD BE AUCTIONED TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER AND THE PROCEEDS RETURNED. THE FORMER PROPERTY OWNERS AS REQUIRED BY THE CONSTITUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND DO WE HAVE ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORE SO I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND- THE CHAPTER EIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW WE ALLOW A NONPROFIT TO BID ON A PROPERTY. DOES THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE BILL FROM THE NONPROFIT. S. THANK YOU THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT- UNDER CHAPTER EIGHT THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS NO SAY WHATSOEVER IN WHETHER THAT THE BID IS ACCEPTED- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN- IF I NONPROFIT PARTICIPATES UNDER CHAPTER SEVEN AND- AUCTION TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. THEN THE PROCEEDS ARE THEN DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE WHO HAVE A REMAINING INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL OWNER AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW CHAPTER EIGHT DOES NOT ALLOW THE OWNER TO HAVE ANY REMAINING INTEREST. A POST SALE. SO WITH FIVE IF THE TAX BILL IS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEY'RE SELLING THE HOUSE FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. FIT THE PERSON DOESN'T GET FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND BACK. SO UNDER THE CHAPTER SEVEN OPTION IF THAT'S THE CONTEXT OF THE SALE THEN YES IF IT'S- SALE UNDER CHAPTER EIGHT THEN NO NO YOU DON'T GET ANY MONEY AT ALL THE- THE ORIGINAL PROPERTY ARE GETS NOTHING. THAT CORRECT STAFF COULD I ASK THE CHAIR TO ASK STAFF. THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. THANK YOU DR CORK- IN THE CONTEXT OF A CHAPTER EIGHT SALE- NO WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER DOES NOT GET ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS RETURNED HOWEVER THAT IS BECAUSE THE PROPERTY IS ONLY OFFERED FOR A MINIMUM BID AMOUNT WHICH IS UNDER LAW THE- TAXES FEES ASSESSMENTS AND PENALTIES AND ANY COP GENERALLY SPEAKING COSTS- TO REIMBURSE THE COUNTY FOR CONDUCTING THE SALE. HARM SO AGAIN IF IT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PROPERTY. THEN THE NONPROFIT JUST PAGE TEN THOUSAND IF THAT'S WHAT'S OWED. CORRECT BUT AS MISS LANG POINTED OUT THIS THE- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DON'T ENGAGE IN THAT PRACTICE THAT I CAN BELIEVE THAT. OKAY THANK YOU MY PLEASURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THIS BILL WAS PROMPTED BY A- MICHIGAN'S SUPREME COURT DECISION INTERPRETING MICHIGAN LAW AND THEIR LIFE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING HOW DOES THIS- APPLY TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- CHAIR IRWIN SO THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION INTERPRETS THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. SO EXCUSE ME THE CALIFORNIA'S ANALOG TO THE FIFTH AMENDMENT SIMILAR SIMILARLY TO FEDERAL LAW. AND IT'S OUR VIEW THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW- EQUITY IS RECOGNIZED AS A DISTINCT PROPERTY INTERESTS AND IS THEREFORE PROTECTED FROM UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKINGS- THERE'S NOTHING IN CALIFORNIA PRESIDENT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WOULD TAKE A- I GUESS UNLESS PROTECTIVE VIEW. OF EQUITY THEN NOT THE FEDERAL COURTS TO. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- I THINK IT'S ALL AS- DR COURT DID ASK STAFF- WHO'S WRITTEN IF IT IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR- SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE CONCERN AS I WAS REVIEWING THIS BILL THAT THERE WAS. THAT THE WAY THAT IT WOULD. DEAL WITH THE- THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THIS AND A BILL THAT WE ARE NOT WE HAVEN'T HEARD YET TODAY- BY MS WAX- ARE THEY IN CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER OR THEY BOTH WITH THE BOTH- HOW WOULD THAT PLAY OUT OF. THEY BOTH BECAME LAW. IT WITHOUT HEARING THE OTHER BILL YET WELL WE'LL WAIT FOR THAT LATER. I'M SORRY MR THE ARE YOU ASKING ME ARE YOU ASKING DANCER NOW OUR BULLETIN NO YEAH SO I JUST I KNOW MISS WHICH WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO PRESENT THE BILL LATER IS WHAT I'M SAYING BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR- ABOUT AYE. BECAUSE PERHAPS. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS MAYBE I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR BOTH BILLS BEFORE I CONSIDER VOTING FOR EITHER OF THE BILLS- BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR. FROM FROM THE ABOUT THAT. D. E. S. V. BILLS WOULD WORK AT COUNTER PURPOSES AS THE- THE OTHER BILL- AB TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IS AN EXPANSION OF THE CHAPTER EIGHT. TAX SALE PROCESS AND TIS WOULD THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A CHAPTER SEVEN SALE TO OCCUR BEFORE CHAPTER EIGHT. SO THEY WERE IN A PRETTY WEAK SAUCE CHAPTER SEVEN IF CHAPTER SEVEN CELL NOT SUCCESSFUL MANAGER CREATE. A CELL WOULD TAKE PLACE THEY WOULD REQUIRE THAT CHAPTER SEVEN BE CONDUCTED BEFORE CHAPTER RETAILERS TO CLOSE OKAY AND IF THERE IS NO INTEREST ONLY THEN COULD CHAPTER EIGHT SALE TAKE PLACE IN IN THE- SO THAT WE HAVE NOT YET HEARD FROM. HER YET. HOW HOUSE CHAPTER EIGHT EXPANDED IN THAT IT WOULD BE- COUNTER TO- ALLOWING WOULD JUST SIT BE THE FIRST SALE IN PLACE ESSENTIALLY. NO SIR IT JUST SIMPLY EXPANDS THE EXISTING IT EXPANDS ELIGIBLE USES UNDER THE EXISTING CHAPTER A PROCESS. OKAY I THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE- FIRST HAVE A QUORUM SO WE'RE GOING TO THE ROLL CALL IRWIN. HERE WHEN HERE GREAT GRAYSON. LEVINE MAYES HERE SANTIAGO SEYARTO- RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM SO OF WE WILL OF. BE ABLE TO TAKE A VOTE- R. OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TWO BILLS ARE IN CONFLICT BECAUSE ONE IS AN EXPANSION OF CHAPTER EIGHT. AND TO THE OTHER REALLY REDUCES THE ABILITY TO USE CHAPTER EIGHT SO. I WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS AS FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HEAR BOTH BILLS TO JUST NOT FELT RIGHT NOW. AND THEN YOU CAN ADD YOU CAN ADD ON LATER- THE MY RECOMMENDATION IS A NON VOTE. I'M PERSONALLY I'M GONNA BE A NO VOTE BECAUSE I AM SUPPORTING- MS WICKS IS BILL BUT I'VE- IF WE I'M LEAVING IT UP TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO DO WHAT THEY WANT AND IF THEY'RE NOT CLEAR UNTIL THEY'VE HEARD THE OTHER TESTIMONY. I JUST FEEL FREE TO LAY OFF RIGHT NOW. THAT WORK RIGHT OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU THIS ITSELF- VERY- SIMPLER IN CONCEPT THE THIS KIND OF SITUATION CAN HAPPEN TO ALL OF US ALL PROPERTY OWNERS SO UNFAIR IN OUR OCTOBER ISSUE- SO MOST PEOPLE DO NOT INTENTIONALLY FAIL. TO PAY THEIR TAXES PEOPLE MAY MISCALCULATE THE PROJECT SIX PART HAVE UNEXPECTED THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP- AS THE- ESTATES ARE ARE IN LIMBO AND LYFT ARE SIMPLY- THINGS- JUST TO HAPPEN. A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE ORDER- PUT AN END TO HOME EQUITIES STAFFED IN CALIFORNIA BY PREVENTING A PUBLIC AGENCY TAXING AGENCY AND A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FROM TAKING AN ENTIRE PROPERTY ALONG WITH THE HOMEOWNER SO EQUITY THAT WE HAVE BUILT. A MAJOR- SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL ALSO HOW THE JOB IS TO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION PACIFIC CARDIGAN FOUNDATION AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WILL COUNTY. TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR'S AS WELL. SO I HOPE THAT THE ONE- YOU HAVE A QUORUM AND- OR YOU HAVE DONE MORE RESEARCH I WOULD ASK DO YOU VOTE I ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI- DO WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND SECOND IT OKAY ALL RIGHT AND- CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE PHùMISSILES ARE ON AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS IRWIN NO IRWIN NOW WHEN. WHEN ON A GRAY GRAYSON LEVINE NOT VOTING MAYES MAYES NOT VOTING. CALDERON PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS NO. QUIRK ARE NOT VOTING FOR NOW CORRECT NOT LOADING SANTIAGO SEYARTO IT'S LOCAL IT HAS ONE OKAY- THAT BILL IS ON CALL AND- WE ARE GOING TO GO AGAIN SLIGHTLY OUT OF ORDER AND HAVING HIS WEEKS COME UP NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH GENTLEMAN. OF THE- THIS WEBSITE I THINK YOU YOU- HEARD THE DISCUSSION OF WE DO- THE COMMITTEE DOES THINK THAT THE TWO BILLS ARE IN CONFLICT- IF YOU COULD- IF I DON'T KNOW IF IN YOUR TALKING POINTS YOU WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THE CHAPTER SEVEN IN CHAPTER EIGHT OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT- A LOT OF MEMBERS ARE STAYING OFF UNTIL THEY HEAR THOSE BILLS. OKAY- THANK YOU I NEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I DIDN'T HEAR THE WHOLE CONVERSATION OR I'M NOT GONNA HAVE A TOUGH LADY WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL BUT I CAN. GLADLY AND WILLINGLY HAPPILY PRESENT. MY BILL- I WANT TO THANK AT TERROR IRWIN IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY PERCENT TWENTY AB TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE STATE IS FACING A HOUSING CRISIS AND TOO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO FIND A SAFE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. ONE EXISTING STRATEGY TO EXPAND THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THE CHAPTER EIGHT TAX SALE PROCESS. THE CHAPTER EIGHT PROCESS GIVES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY OPTION TO BUY TAX DEFAULT PROPERTIES BEFORE THEY ARE SOLD AT PUBLIC AUCTION. IF THEY WILL BE USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR TO PROVIDE OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS. THIS BILL UPDATE CHAPTER EIGHT TAX DEFAULT PROPERTY SALES PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FIRST IT REQUIRES COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S AT THE FIRST REQUIRES TANEY. IT REQUIRES COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR WEBSITES TO INCLUDE CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW NONPROFITS AND OTHER ENTITIES. CAN OBTAIN THE LIST OF DEFAULT PROPERTIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE SOLD AT PUBLIC OPTION. IN ORDER TO GET BETTER DATA ON CHAPTER EIGHT SALES THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES. THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE NUMBER OF CHAPTER EIGHT. TAX SALES THAT OCCUR EACH YEAR. AND FINALLY THE BILL CREATES ADVISORY GROUP IN THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION. THROUGH CHAPTER EIGHT SALES THERE WHILE BE WORKING TO FIND A MORE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO HOST THE ADVISORY GROUP AFTER THIS BILL PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE PASSED TODAY. I WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE STAKEHOLDERS GOING FORWARD TO ADDRESS ANY. CONCERNS WITH A BILL THIS IS AN AUTHOR SPONSORED. MEASURE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES. OKAY SO. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AS YOU COULD TELL WE'VE BEEN KIND OF STUCK IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING COUPLE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THIS I WANTED TO THINK THIS THAT'S THE ONLY WOMAN STAFF FOR HELPING US THROUGH THIS AND I'M REGRETTABLY THE TREASURE TECH SECTORS ARE STILL POSED AS FUNDAMENTALLY THERE'S A BELIEF AMONG THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THE STATUTE IN A WAY THAT SEPARATES PEOPLE FROM THEIR PROPERTY FOR FASTER AND ACCELERATE THE WAYS AND USES FOR. THE GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT- AND DOT PART SEEMS LIKE WE CAN'T GET OVER IT BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHOR IN THE MEAN TIME TO MAKE SURE IT PASSES IT IT ACTUALLY WILL WORK ON THE GROUND FOR US AND A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED TO OBSERVE TO YOU WHEN A PROPERTY GOES TO TAX BILL IF IT'S RESIDENTIAL MINIMALLY IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS THAT A PROPERTY OWNER HAS NOT PAID THEIR PROPERTY TAXES THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES DEFAULT IN ELIGIBLE. AND BEFORE WE CAN TAKE IT TO TAX SALE WERE KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR WE SENT MULTIPLE CERTIFIED MILLIONS AND THIS IS EACH YEAR EVERY YEAR THAT THEY HAVE NOT PAID THEIR TAXES SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CATCH ANYBODY OFF GUARD UNLESS THEY'RE IN A POSITION MENTALLY THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEIR OWN FINANCES IN WHICH CASE WHEN YOU GO TO PUT ON THE TAX BILL AND WE DISCOVER THAT. NORMALLY THEY'RE REFERRED TO ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND WE WOULD NEVER TAKE THAT PROPERTY TAX ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO FIRST HELP THE OWNER BECOME CURRENT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY STRUGGLING ON THE COMMITTEES REALLY STRUGGLING MY LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE IS WITH ON THE MEASURE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP THE OWNER GET CURRENT AND RESTORE THE PROPERTY TO TAX PAYING PROPERTY I WANT TO GO TO CHAPTER EIGHT IT BECOMES A NONPROFIT OWNED. I PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT COMES OFF THE TAX WILL FOREVER WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES LIKE HOUSING OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE COUNTY TAX COLLECTORS TO GET OVER THOSE TWO HURDLES I'M JUST FOR CONTEXT AND SAN FRANCISCO THEY WAIT NINE YEARS BECAUSE TEN YEARS IS WHEN YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE IT THEY WORK FOR WITH POPULAR FOR NINE YEARS TO TRY TO GET THEM CURRENT BEFORE THEY DO IT- AND PLASTER COUNTY. BECAUSE OF THE SNOW LOAD IN THE TIMING THEY DON'T DO IT UNTIL ABOUT SIX AND A HALF YEARS AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE PEOPLE TO SEE THE PROPERTY A SOME TIME. BECAUSE OF THE- IN ST BERNARD DINO WITH. THEY DON'T CONSIDER IT UNTIL SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. SO THEY'RE TRYING REALLY HARD WITH THE RESIDENTIAL. PROPERTY NOT TO TAKE IT TO ANY KIND OF SALE LET ALONE CHAPTER EIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE STILL IN OPPOSITION BUT AGAIN I WANT TO COMMEND. THE AUTHORS OFFICES BEEN NOTHING BUT ENGAGING WITH US AND TRYING TO WORK. AND WORK SOMETHING OUT BUT IT'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT OVER. THE USE OF CHAPTER EIGHT AND EXPANDING. THE USE OF IT TO. SEPARATE PEOPLE FROM THEIR PROPERTY AND TURN IT OVER TO A- A NON TAXING. NON TEXT GENERATING. AT THIS PROPERTY SO. THAT'S OPPOSITION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AND SENATE. EDUCATIONAL PROCESS FOR ME AS WELL WITH THESE TWO CHAPTERS THAT. THANK YOU- I I'M SURE THERE WILL BE AN ART I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER. THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DO OF. DR CORRECT YOU HAVE A QUESTION. FOR THE OPPOSITION WITNESS- CIVIL I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN- SO IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROPERTY GOES UP ON CHAPTER SEVEN. AND NOBODY BIDS ON IT. FAN COULD GO TO CHAPTER EIGHT. IT COULD THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT A LAW THAT REQUIRES AND WE'RE NO REQUIRED TO DO CHAPTER EIGHT. THEY CAN TAKE IT TO OPERATE IF THERE'S A INTERESTED PARTY THAT WANTS TO COME FORWARD THAT'S PART OF OUR PROBLEM HER BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF NOT. MAYBE NONPROFITS NOT KNOWING HOW TO NAVIGATE THE CHAPTER EIGHT PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF VOLUNTARY- NORMALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHAPTER SEVEN IS IF IT DOESN'T GET THE MINIMUM BID THEY CAN READ THE CAN DO RE OFFER SALE ABOUT A MONTH LATER OR JUST STAYS ON THE ROLE AND THEY KEEP TRYING TO WORK WITH THE HOMEOWNER. I'M PARTICULARLY AFTER TWO YEARS THE PANDEMIC THERE'S A LOT OF EXTRA EFFORT BEING PUT INTO THAT- SO IT'S IT AUTOMATICALLY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE IN CHAPTER SEVEN THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT WE GO TO TOP. OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT THAT HELPS THANK YOU- JUST ASSERTED. AUTHOR- THERE WAS A RECENT CASE YOU PROBABLY HEARD OF WHERE THE STREET WAS OWNED BY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION AND CHAIRMAN CISCO. AND IT WENT UP. IT ACTUALLY WENT UP FOR A- CHAPTER SEVEN SAID OR I HAVE A SEVEN OR EIGHT BUT IT WENT UP FOR SALE SOMEBODY BOUGHT IT SIGHT UNSEEN. AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS THE STREET. WHICH NOW YOUNG STREET IN THE MIDDLE OF PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT- THINGS HAPPENED AND I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN AND SOMEONE COULD LOSE THEIR EQUITY BECAUSE THEY JUST YOU ARE UNABLE TO FIND THEM SO I HAVE THAT CONCERN ABOUT YOUR BILL THANK YOU. OUR RIGHTS TO AT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I AM HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU MISTER CORK AND SEE IF WE CAN- ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN SOME OTHER WAY- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT'S PRIMARILY DRIVING THIS BILL IS JUST THE NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND TO ME THAT OUT WAYS SOME OF THE ISSUES AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE THIS EPIDEMIC OF HOMELESSNESS ACROSS OUR STATE TRYING TO PUT ALL SOLUTIONS ON THE TABLES THE GOAL BUT I HEAR YOU ON THAT CONCERN AND I'M HAPPY TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND MEET ITH YOU WANTED IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN KIND OF IT ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS I'M HAPPY DID CONTINUE ALSO TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IF WE CAN FIND OTHER WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER- BURKE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

MISTRANSLATED IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING ON FILE ITEM THE FOUR EIGHTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT NINETY THREE SORRY MR FONG IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE ALMOST UP. BUT ALAS. BLESSED MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENTING AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMAN FRANK BIGELOW WHO IS UNABLE TO BE HERE AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO WOULD MAKE INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL BUSINESSES ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS WHEN THEY PURCHASE A GENERATOR FOR BACKUP ENERGY SPECIFICALLY THE BILL TARGETS THOSE IN CAL FIRE'S HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONE OR AN AREA THAT EXPERIENCES ONE OR MORE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER STRUTS OFFICE. SHUT OFFS IN THE LAST TAXABLE YEAR THIS TAX CREDIT AIMS TO COVER HIGH CAUGHT THEM COVER HALF OF THE COST OF THE GENERATOR UP TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS DO MOST OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT MR BIGELOW'S CONSTITUENTS SUFFER FROM POWER OUTAGES DUE TO WEATHER OR WILDFIRES DURING EACH FIRE SEASON. PROVIDING SOME RELIEF TO PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED GENERATES FOR RELIABLE BACKUP ENERGY WHEN THOSE SITUATIONS DO OCCUR IS A WAY TO HELP OUR- COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THERE WERE SIXTY SEVEN POWER SHUT OFFS WHICH IMPACTED ROUGHLY TWO POINT SIX MILLION CUSTOMERS. UNFORTUNATE DURING THESE OUTRAGES PEOPLE LOSE FOOD OR ARE FORCED TO SPEND MONEY A HOTEL IN AN AREA WITH POWER. THIS CAN BE INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE PARTICULAR SHUT OFF FOR SEVERAL DAYS LONG AB TWENTY NINETY TWO ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO INVEST IN A BACK UP GENERATOR TO HELP ENSURE THEY HAVE. RELIABLE ENERGY IN THE EVENT THE GREATEST AUTO OPERATING. AND WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TIME- MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER THOUGH WOULD BE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHTS AND YOU ARE A PRIMARY WITNESS I ASSUME CORRECT GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH A RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT THIRTY NINE WORLD COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO. OUR COUNTIES TO BORN THE BRUNT OF THE P. S. P. S. OUTAGES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THOSE HAVE BEEN SUPPLANTED BY E. P. S. S. OUTAGES. OF MUCH SHORTER DURATION BUT MUCH GREATER FREQUENCY- THOSE ROLLED OUT IN JUST A FEW COUNTIES LAST YEAR BUT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO GO OUT AND MANY MORE COUNTIES THIS YEAR. AND ALL THESE OUTAGES WHETHER MULTI DAY OUTAGES FOR TWELVE HOUR OUTAGES REALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF ECONOMIC DISLOCATION AND SAFETY ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOR SOME OF THE RESIDENTS IT CAN BE A MATTER OF BEING ABLE TO USE YOUR WATER PUMP TO PUMP WATER TO THE GROUND FOR SANITATION DRINKING AND FIREFIGHTING. SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO WE THINK IT WILL HELP BRING BACK SOME OF THE ENERGY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCE THAT A LOT OF OUR CALIFORNIANS. THOUGHT THEY HAD UNTIL THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE OUTRAGEOUS WE'D RATHER HAVE THE VERY SAFE ENERGY GRID- AND WE THINK THIS WILL HELP US BUILD IN SOME OF THE RELIABILITY THAT WE ONCE HAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND ARE THERE ANY OTHER- PRIMARY- I MEAN ANY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'LL I'LL ASK WHEN I TO YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS- WHAT PERCENT OF THESE GENERATORS ARE- DIESEL GENERATORS BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE REALLY YOU KNOW WE'RE BUT WE HAVE. BIG GOALS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES AND WOULDN'T THIS JUST BE- MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THAT POLICY SO IT DEPENDS ON THE APPLICATION A LOT OF THESE GENERATORS ESPECIALLY FOR SOME BUSINESSES WILL BE DIESEL GENERATORS JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN DRIVE THE OUTPUT THAT'S NECESSARY OR THESE THINGS- AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T EXPECT THESE TO BE USED FREQUENTLY OR USED OFTEN AND SO IT'S A MATTER OF. PROVIDING THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE MICRO GRIDS- DEPLOYED WITH CLEAN ENERGY- BUT UNLESS AND UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE POWER- AND IT'S REALLY TOUGH TO MAINTAIN A VIBRANT COMMUNITY AND A WORKING pRELIABLE POWER. RIGHT THANK YOU A- I WAS WAITING FOR YOU DOCTOR FOR- I STILL WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE FIRST TWO BILLS- SO ON THIS ONE- I DO FOR YEAH I'D- TO TRY AND SAY DO SOLAR AND BATTERY SHE'S GOING TO BE FOUR OR FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE SO I THINK. DIESEL IS THE ONLY- MICHAEL LIKELY- ALTERNATIVE FOR SOMEONE DOING BACKUP POWER UNLESS THEY'RE JUST GETTING SOLAR FOR DAY TO DAY USE. OUR BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY EXPENSIVE SO I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU GO TO DIESEL AND IT PROBABLY WON'T BE USED ALL THAT OFF BECAUSE FRANKLY THE GRADES CHEAPER THAN. RUNNING OFF DIESEL FUEL HOWEVER. WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WITH ANY TAX CREDIT IS THAT IT GOES TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND PERHAPS DR MISTER BIGELOW COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT- IT'S GOING TO GO TO EVERYBODY WHETHER THEY NEED IT OR NOT WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THIS OR NOT. USUALLY YOU HAVE A- TAX INCENTIVE TO GET SOME PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THEY WOULDN'T. SO THAT'S A CONCERN- THE OTHER THING IS THIS IS GOING TO INVOLVE A LOT OF MONEY. WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF JUST HAVING A GRANT PROGRAM. TO HELP PEOPLE BUY THESE FOR PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T AFFORD IT. THOSE ARE JUST QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW BUT MISTER BIGELOW COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT LATER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES SAID. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO ADDRESS THE DIESEL ISSUE THE GOOD NEWS IS. IS THAT IT'S NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL DIESEL LEFT. FROM FOSSIL FUELS- THE WE ARE NOW WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY OF DIESEL FROM RENEWABLES. AND IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN OR RIGHT IN MY DISTRICT SO IT'S COMING FROM.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORD TO- FILE ITEM SIX AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE. AFTERNOON MISTER WORD AFTER NEW MADAM CHAIR. TOLD ME I WANT TO GET SITUATED AND I'M SURE WE HAVE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US- MANAGER MEMBERS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE HOME PRICES CLIMB STATEWIDE BY MORE THAN 17% AND IN SOME REGIONS OF OUR STATE EXCEEDED MORE THAN. WITH FORECASTS OF COURSE ON THE RISE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO NOW THIS IS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO OUR CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN PRODUCTION AND THE SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCES BUILT UP OVER THE DECADES. WHAT THE- NEW HOME PERMITS HAVE ALL RISEN AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON MANY OF THE SUPPLY SIDE QUESTIONS. SPECULATED SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY HOWEVER IS ANOTHER SILENT DRIVING FORCE OF THE RECENT RECORD HOME PRICES WE'VE SEEN THIS GROWING TREND OF SHORT TERM INVESTORS AFFECTING HOUSING COSTS IN RESALE PROPERTIES. VACANT RESIDENTIAL LAND IN NEW CONSTRUCTIONS. INFERRED MARKET ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT INVESTOR BOUGHT HOMES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE GROWTH OF SALES YEAR OVER YEAR FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY ONE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF SALES GOING TO ALL CASH INVESTOR LIKE- ACTIVITY IS APPROACHING A RECORD SPECULATORS ENTERED THE MARKET THE OFTEN OUTBID WOULD BE A LONG TIME HOMEOWNERS WITH A CASH ONLY OFFER OF THEIR OWN. SEEKING TO MAXIMIZE GAINS AND REDUCE RISK THE SELLING SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY CAN ACHIEVE AN EVEN HIGHER PRICE AND THIS RAISES COMPARABLE SALES FIGURES FOR NEW PRODUCTS TO BE PUT ON THE MARKET. PUSHING HOME PRICES EVEN HIGHER WHEN HIGHER COST PROPERTIES A RAISED MIDDLE INCOME PROPERTIES BECOME HIGHER COSTS AND LOWER INCOME PROPERTIES ARE RE TO THE- WELL IN. BUYER AND LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS OUT MY UP. THERE ARE FEES ARE THE BASIC NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES FROM THIS ACTIVITY. EVERYONE'S COST BURDENS ARE RAISED AND MORE PEOPLE ARE PUSHED TOWARDS THE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS OR SAYING GOODBYE TO CALIFORNIA. UNCHECKED THIS MARKET FAILURE IS FRUSTRATING OUR CONSTITUENTS TO GET INTO THEIR HOME AND RISKING OUR POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST A GENERATION. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE BEFORE YOU WOULD IMPOSE A QUICK SALE OF A HOME OR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. BY INVESTORS SEEKING SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AFTER THE THIRTY YEAR- IT HAS INTRODUCED OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE THE SURTAX TO BE REDUCED BY TWENTY PERCENT. UNTIL IT'S FULLY REDUCED BY YEAR SEVEN. GENERATED FUNDS ARE NOT HERE FOR THE STATE THEY WOULD BE INSTEAD ALLOCATED TO CAP TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TO CITIES AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS FOR COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE ALL DESPERATELY NEEDED. THEY ARE TIED TO PROPERTY. THE TAX SELL EXEMPTS. OWNER OCCUPIED HOMES FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL SITES PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SITES WERE THE SAME. THERE IS LIST THE TOTAL PROPERTY YOU'RE PART VITAL PROPERTY UNAVAILABLE OPEN SPACE OR VACATED SPACE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THIS IS NOT A GENERAL TAX PROPOSAL AND IT ISN'T ABOUT BRINGING MONEY INTO THE STATE. IF IT HAD ITS INTENDED EFFECT ACTIVITY WOULD BE REDUCED NO TAX TO BE COLLECTED THE MARKET WOULD STABILIZE AND WORKING FAMILIES WOULD WIN. THIS IS ABOUT USING OUR TAX POLICY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND HELP MORE WOULD BE HOME OWNERS ACTUALLY GET THEIR BID IS ACCEPTED. HOWEVER ANY REVENUES THAT WERE COLLECTED WILL BE SENT RIGHT BACK INTO COMMUNITIES ALSO A WIN. AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT SPECULATION HAS BEEN PRESENT IN THE BALTIMORE MARC MARKET CYCLES AND IT WILL BE THE LAST. BUT IT IS TIMELY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A FINANCIAL CONTROL TO DISCOURAGE SPECULATION TO GIVE WORKING CALIFORNIANS THE EDGE TO. BUY INTO THEIR OWN COMMUNITY AND ONLY AT A BETTER PRICE. BECAUSE WE HAVE A RESPONSE. TO FIRST. WHAT ARE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA FOR. HOMES ARE PLACES FOR FAMILIES AND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN. HOMES HELP PEOPLE AND FAMILIES PRESERVE AND GROW THEIR WEALTH. AT THE EXPENSE OF PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. HOMES ARE NOT A QUICK TRADE ON THE MARKET. ACTIVITY THAT'S CREATING A MARKET FAILURE. BENEFITING THOSE WITH INCREDIBLE MEANS AND LEAVING EVERYONE ELSE BEHIND. I LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE DISCUSSION TODAY. THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGING POLICY PROPOSAL THAT'S USED ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT THE FIRST TIME. IT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IT'S ACTUALLY REFLECTING RESPONSES THAT WERE SEEN. WORLDWIDE NOT LIKE TO PRESENT MY WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL RATE LONG REPRESENTING HOUSING NOW. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS REVEREND RAJAN FONG AND I AM A SENIOR ORGANIZER WITH HOUSING NOW AND ALSO PRESBYTERIAN PASTOR HEARING LOSS JUST WILL NOT HERE BUT DOWN BELOW. HOUSING NOW IS A BROAD AND DIVERSE MOVEMENT BUILDING COALITION WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE HOUSING AFFORDABLE. AND TO COMBAT DISPLACEMENT CRISIS THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY SEVENTY ONE. AS YOU ALL ARE WHERE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS LIMITED AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR THE AVERAGE WORKING CALIFORNIANS DEPLETING IT DEPLETED BY RISING RENTS AND MEDIUM HOME PRICES. ARE SEVEN TIMES THAT MOST HOUSEHOLDS MAKE. IN ORDER TO AFFORD AVERAGE RENTS IN THE STATE WORKERS NEED TO EARN MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER HOUR. INCREASINGLY RENTERS ARE BEING PUSHED OUT BY A FAIRLY UNREGULATED RENTAL MARKET RUN BY AN EXPANSIVE EVER AGREEMENT ALKALIZING CORPORATE REALIST INDUSTRY. TODAY THE AVERAGE WORKING BRING IN SEEKING HOMEOWNERSHIP. OUT OVER THIRTY TIMES AFTER LOSING TO ALL BASH SHORT TERM REAL ESTATE INVESTORS HELLO ANTS FOR JUST THE- ONE OF A- SO FIVE OF INVESTOR HOME PURCHASES WERE PAID FOR WITH ALL CASH. 35% OF THESE INVESTOR HOME PURCHASES WERE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IN A REDFIN REPORT AND INVESTOR TO THE ACROSS THE NATION IT WAS FOUND THAT INVESTORS BOUGHT AN AVERAGE OF TREND. A SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN PARTICULAR THE STUDY SHOWED A DISPROPORTIONATE TARGETING OF MAJORITY BLACK AND BROWN NEIGHBORHOODS BY INVESTORS WITH BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS COMPARED WITH ONLY 12% AND OTHERS. THESE TRENDS LOOK THE SAME HERE IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN MY OWN CITY OF LOS ANGELES OVER ALL AN AVERAGE OF 10% OF HOMES WERE BOUGHT BY INVESTORS THE LOS ANGELES. MEANWHILE 27% OF HOMES IN HISTORICALLY BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS LA WERE BOUGHT BY INVESTORS LAST YEAR WELL OVER DOUBLE THE CITY AVERAGE. IN ONE BLACK AND BROWN MAJORITY NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND USC UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHRN CALIFORNIA. 48% ALMOST HALF OF THE HOMES PURCHASED LAST YEAR WERE BY SPECULATORS AND THAT ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS STORY OF DISPLACEMENT EVER WORKING POOR AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TODAY NOT ONLY CONTINUES OUR NATION'S RICH SPUR SSTEMIC RACIST PRACTICES OF RED LINING. BUT IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RESEGREGATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS DEMONSTRATED BY REPORT RECENTLY BY THE URBAN HABITAT. POOR WORKING CLASS FAMILIES OF COLOR ARE BEING PUSHED INTO THE OUTSKIRTS EVER COMMUNITIES WITH FEWER RESOURCES. LOSS OF GENERATIONAL SUPPORT LONG COMMUTES TO WORK INCREASING BUT TRAFFIC AND POLLUTION. AND LESS TIME TO INVEST IN OUR FAMILIES OUR SCHOOLS OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND EVEN BEYOND MY WORK AS A HOUSING ORGANIZER DALY I HAVE CONVERSATIONS AS A PASTOR AND JUST AS A RESIDENTS WITH MY NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS FOR EXASPERATED BY THE HOUSING MARKET. AND HAVE RECEIVED EVICTION NOTICES ALREADY CONSIDERING MOVING INTO A VAN OR OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AWAY FROM FAMILY AD FRIENDS THIS IS THE REALITY THAT OUR CITIES AND OUR STATE IS FACING RIGHT NOW PERHAPS MANY OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS. I MYSELF AS A SINGLE WORKING PARENTS HAVE LOOK FOR YEARS TO EXPAND OUTSIDE MY TINY SEVEN HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT APARTMENT WITH A GROWING TO CHILDREN BUT I'VE GIVEN NOT BECAUSE OF THE RISING COSTS. IN MY OWN COMMUNITY LIKE MANY SINGLE PARENTS I CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE A COMMUNITY I HAVE SUPPORT. I COMMITTEE SUPPORT I HAVE SURROUNDING MY CHILDREN NOR DO I HAVE THE MEANS TO MOVE TO A HEALTHIER MORE SUSTAINABLE SITUATION IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD CALIFORNIANS ACROSS RACE CLASS AND REGION SIMPLY CANNOT COMPETE WITH A LARGE CORPORATIONS LOCAL COMPANIES AND WEALTHY BUYERS. SPECULATORS WHO SEE OUR COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS SOLELY AS INVESTMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFIT RATHER THAN HOMES THAT ARE WORKING FAMILIES DESPERATELY NEED. AND AS HOMEOWNERSHIP BECOMES EVER MORE UNAFFORDABLE FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR MARKET SHARE. ALSO WE MUST NOT PUT A BLIND EYE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY IS THIS SPECULATION DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING CAN USE OF COLOR THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED. IT ALSO MOVES US BACKWARDS IN OUR FIGHT FOR RACIAL EQUALITY AND EQUITY WE SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW PROFITS TO DETERMINE THE WEALTH AND HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE WILL DO BETTER AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMUNITY IN THIS COMMITTEE. CAN DO THAT. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE IS A REAL SOLUTION THAT WILL TEMPER GLOBAL SPECULATORS PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY AND BRING REAL LASTING CHANGE FOR THE FAMILIES THAT NEED IT MOST IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT WILL CREATE A FISCAL DISINCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGED SPECULATORS TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO INVEST IN SIR FAMILIES WILL BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO LITTLE HOMES BE WHAT THEY WERE MEANT TO BE. HOMES A HEALTHY AFFORDABLE AND STABLE PLACE WHERE FAMILIES A PLACE FOR MY OWN CHILDREN TO LAY THEIR HEADS. THE MOST POWERFUL ROLE GOVERNMENT CAN PLAY IN HELPING EVERYDAY FAMILIES. IS NOT ONLY THE PAST POLICIES THAT PROVIDE RELIEF IN THE MOMENT. BOSTON CREATE POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS THAT WAS CLOSER TOWARDS DIGNITY HEALTH AND WELLNESS FOR ALL. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS LABOR UNIONS AND NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE DO BELIEVE EIGHTY SOMETHING SEVENTY ONE IS ONE OF THOSE POLICIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SURE MEMBERS CATALINA SANCHEZ WITH CORBIN KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VANESSA CHAVEZ WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE JUST JUST WANT TO CHECK YOUR THE PRIMARY WITNESS RIGHT OKAY. AB SEVENTY SEVENTY ONE WOULD IMPOSE AN UNPRECEDENTED TAX OF UP 225% ON PROPERTY OWNERS IF THEY SELL THEIR PROPERTY PRIOR TO SEVEN YEARS. BY IMPOSING AN ADDITIONAL TAX ON THE GAIN. FROM SELLING A HOUSE IT DIMINISHES WEALTH BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNGER AND MORE DIVERSE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIANS NOW BUYING HOMES FURTHERING THE WEALTH INEQUITY IN THE STATE. IT ALSO LIMITS THE FREEDOM TO MOVE OR RELOCATE. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING AS OFTEN MANY PROPERTY OWNERS ARE FACED WITH THE NEED TO RELOCATE. DUE TO AN UNFORESEEN LIFE OF THAT WHICH INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO A JOB LOSS OR DIVORCE OR EVEN A DISABILITY AND FURTHER AT THIS BILL NEGATIVELY IMPACTS HOUSING SUPPLY. WELL AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE IS TOUTED AS A BILL THAT WILL BRING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOME BUYERS. WHO HAVE BEEN OUTBID IN THE PURCHASE OF A HOME ACTUALLY HAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE AFFECT OF ITS INTENT. THIS BILL PRIORITIZES CORPORATE OWNERSHIP OVER FAMILY OWNERSHIP BY CONTINUING TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PURCHASE PROPERTIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUNNING THEM OUT AND THEN REDUCES THE SUPPLY OF HOMES FOR OWNER OCCUPANTS BY INCENTIVIZING CORPORATE BUYERS TO HOLD ON TO THEIR PROPERTIES UNTIL THE SEVEN YEAR. SEASONING PERIOD EXPIRES LEADING TO LESS HOUSING INVENTORY AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND EQUITY GAINS. TO GO TO THE COMPANIES AS OF APRIL TWENTY FIRST. BANKRATE REPORTED THAT INTEREST RATES FOR A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE HAVE REACHED FIVE POINT TWO EIGHT PERCENT. WITH INTEREST RATES LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RISE AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE JUST ADDS MORE COST HURDLES FOR HOME BUYERS. NOT ONLY ARE HOME BUYERS FACED WITH RISING INTEREST RATES. BUT UNDER AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE IT WILL ALSO CONSTRICTED HOUSING SUPPLY AS INVESTORS HOLD ON TO THEIR PROPERTIES. WHICH WILL FURTHER RESULT IN COST INCREASES TO THE PRICE OF A HOME. C. A. R. ALSO HAS CONCERNS ABOUT CORPORATE OWNERSHIP AND THE ABILITY OF OWNER OCCUPANT TO COMPETE IN THE MARKETPLACE HOWEVER. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE MISSES THE MARK IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR THESE REASONS CA ARE MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IS THERE A SECOND PRIMARY WITNESS. I DON'T KNOW IF I'M PRIMARY. BUT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MYSELF IN THE BRICKFIELDS REAL ESTATE GROUP I'M SO. OKAY C. A. YEAH BECAUSE THAT WAS TWO MINUTES AND THEN SO YOU HAVE. ANOTHER PRIMARY WITNESS AND YOU CAN THE PRIMARY WITNESS CAN SIT AND. YEAH. SCHERING COMMITTEE MEMBERS TWENTY BUT WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION- HERE UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION I'LL KEEP IT SHORT- IN A TIME OF RECKLESS THERE'S A SURPLUS- WITH THE STATE WOOD WE FEEL LIKE IT'S A WRONG TIME TO IMPOSE A NEW 25% TAX ON A PROPERTY OWNER THAT JUST WANTS TO SELL THEIR THEIR HOME AND TO AS THE ANNOUNCED POINTS OUT THERE IS A NEED FOR INVESTORS THAT TIME SOMETIMES FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO UPDATE A HOME RIGHT- AND THAT'S WHERE INVESTORS YOU COME IN. TO PURCHASE A HOME AND HAVE THE CAPITAL TO UPDATED THEN TO PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET- FOR ANOTHER BUYER GROUP TO PURCHASE AND PERHAPS LIVE IN OR USED AS A RENTAL PROPERTY AND FOR THOSE SHORT REASONS- WE OPPOSE THE BILL ALL RIGHT AND THEN OF OTHER OPPOSITION YOUR NAME AND OF WHO YOU ARE AFFILIATED. WITH IN YOUR POSITIONS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM MY NAME'S TERRANCE KILL. I'M AN ATTORNEY- I'M HERE ON MY OWN BEHALF AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF THE BROOK FIELDS REAL ESTATE GROUP. A GROUP OF PRIVATE SECTOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN PURCHASE SALE FINANCING. OWNERSHIP RENTAL AND SO FORTH I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF SUBMITTING A LETTER ON YOUR POSITION LETTER PORTAL. I'D LIKE TO READ INTO THE RECORD PLEASE AND WE'RE WE ARE JUST DOING YOUR NAME POSITION IF YOU WANT TO PASS THE LETTER AROUND YOU CAN DO THAT THE GENTLEMAN I GAVE COPIES OF THE LETTER TO. SO AT THIS POINT YOU'RE DENYING ME THE RIGHT TO SPEAK. THE CORRECT. THIS IS HOW SAY AGAIN THIS IS THE PROCESS CAN WE HAVE THE NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE. ALL RIGHT WATER THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE MEMBERS CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MORE TOP ON BEHLF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR. ON YOUR INTENTIONS- AND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS- WITH- WITH THIS BILL. IT IS- IT IT IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO HAVE CONVERSATION IT IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO HAVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I SPEAK ON WITH MULTIPLE HATS ON AND HAVING- HAVING WENT ON A HOUSING WORKING GROUP TOUR THIS PAST FALL OCTOBER NOVEMBER AND SEEING- THE IMPACT OF THE UNAFFORDABILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BUY A HOME. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE EXASPERATING THAT EFFORT FOR PEOPLE TO BUY HOMES IS THROUGH SPECULATION THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM AT ALL. AND I FULLY WINNER PERCENT SUPPORT INVESTORS- WELL I THINK INVESTING MAKES A GREAT- MAKES FOR A GREAT ECONOMY AND MAKES FOR A SOLID ECONOMY. HOWEVER WE'RE NOT- THE INTENT HERE IS TO NOT. GO AFTER SPECIFICALLY INVESTORS THIS IS TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO ARE IF I READ IT CORRECTLY WHO ARE SPECULATING AND THEY ARE IN IT FOR. A DOLLAR THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT EXIST- THE RIVER FOR A DOLLAR IN AN INFLATED ECONOMY- WHERE THERE'S- WHERE HOUSING IS COMPLETELY UNAFFORDABLE AND OVER AND- I THINK MANY WOULD AGREE OVER PRICED. AND SO WE THROUGH SPECULATION IT FORCES- A BUYER TO ACTUALLY FINANCE EQUITY THAT'S AND THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SO WITH THAT- I'M I'M NOT SURE OF THIS PATHWAY IS THE PATHWAY TO TAKE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COMPASS. SO MANY OTHER AREAS BUT I WOULD- I WOULD OFFER TO JOIN YOUR EFFORT AND TRY TO COME UP WITH A PATHWAY THAT DOES INVOLVE- THE INPUT FROM OPPOSITION. SO THAT WE ARE REALLY CAPTURING THOSE WHO ARE DOING THEIR GREGIS- WORK OF SPECULATION AND NOT GO AFTER THOSE WHO ARE. EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO BE AN INVESTOR SO- AND I SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO- IS A MINUTE AS MIGHT BE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AND I TO ALL BEGIN BY COMMENDING THAT THE AUTHOR I THINK IN TERMS OF. YOUR INTENT WITH THIS BILL AND BY THE GOAL THAT YOU HAVE WITH THIS POLICY- BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS A RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND I THINK- IN. THE FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON THAT HOUSING PRICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE THROUGH THE ROOF IS THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL IMBALANCE BETWEEN DEMAND AND SUPPLY RIGHT. DEMANDS TO HIS SUPPLIES TOO LOW SO ANY POLICY THAT I FURTHER CONSTRICT SUPPLY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO EXACERBATE THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW. I'M AND I THINK THAT FIVE BY CONSTRAINING MARKET FLUIDITY THAT THAT IS. WHAT THE BILL WOULD BE SO I'M- SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT CONCERN AND WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN YOUR- PERSPECTIVE ON THAT WAS JUST PASSING FROM IN CASE RESTORED WATER TO GIVE HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BUT TO. I WILL OFFER MY COMMENTS WHICH ARE GOING TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' FRANKLY- I AGREE WITH MR GRACE COVERS THE SAYS THAT YOU WANT IT REALLY BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS BILL IS A SENSE THAT INVESTING IN A RENTAL HOME MORE TO IS OFTEN THE WA A FAMILY- BUILDS A NEST EGG AND BUILD WEALTH AND BUILD AN OPPORTUNITY AND THIS IS- COUNTERPRODUCTIVE THIS LEGISLATION YOU HAVE BEFORE ME. NOW IF YOU WERE TO. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WERE SOME EXEMPTIONS IN HERE A DIFFERENT THRESHOLD OR PERHAPS TARGETING A DIFFERENT. AUDIENCE THAN MAYBE. WE CAN GET SOMEWHERE WITH THAT BUT THE QUESTION I THINK I'M MORE CURIOUS ABOUT IN MY TENTH. AND FINAL YEAR HERE AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE- I'VE SEEN BILLS- THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PERIOD OF TIME. ON HOUSING. LARGELY FOR MEMBERS WHO REPRESENT URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE YOURSELF- AND I DON'T. DISAGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON SURE YOUR INTENTIONS ARE GOOD AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS- BUT IT JUST SHOCKS ME THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE. ABOUT TWO MILLION THREE MILLION HOMES UNDERSUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOBODY BRINGS BILLS FORWARD. TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BUILD CHEAPER TO BUILD MORE WORK FORCE. AND THIS IS KIND OF- I GUESS I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE- AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS A MUCH LARGER COMMUTE IN THE SMALL. RURAL COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT BUT- THAT THAT THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MANY HURDLES TO BUILDING. NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS IMAGINE THE WORK FORCE THAT WOULD TAKE. WE DON'T GRADUATE ENOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY FROM HIGH SCHOOL THAT ARE QUALIFIED CARPENTERS PLUMBERS PIPEFITTERS ELECTRICIANS ARE PREPARED TO PURSUE CAREERS- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW US. TO BUILD OUR BRONZE I THINK WE BUILD SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR STATEWIDE MISTER GRAYSON MIGHT KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ME I THINK HE'S WELL FAMILIAR WITH THAT INDUSTRY BUT-IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP ON A TWO MILLION HOME DEFICIT. WERE BARELY BUILDING ENOUGH IF YOU WANT TO BUILD A HALF A MILLION HOMES. A YEAR- IT WOULD TAKE FOUR TIMES THE WORK FORCE AND WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TRAIN THE WORKFORCE AND WE'RE NOT MAKING- CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS ANY CHAMBER WE'RE NOT MAKING BUILDING ANY LESS COMPLICATED FASTER OR CHEAPER- AND YET WE STILL KIND OF RECYCLE THE SAME IDEAS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN- IN IT YOU KNOW. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW- NONE OF WHICH SEEM LIKE THEY'RE IN THE REALM OF SOLVING ANY OF THE PROBLEMS SO I'LL LEAVE IT WITH THAT- I APPLAUD YOUR- INTENTIONS BUT- DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS THE WRONG DRECTION- WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT IT LIKE SAID HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. THE DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ALL QUESTIONS. OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO START RESPOND WHATEVER THIS YEAR'S PROGNOSIS OKAY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMART. SO THIS BILL CONTEMPLATES ADDING UP TO A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. CAPITAL GAINS ON TOP OF THE ALREADY CAPITAL GAINS CORRECT. SO SOMEBODY IN THE TOP BRACKET OF LIKE SAY IN CALIFORNIA 13% AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD BE SUBJECT TO BASICALLY A 38240% CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON A PROPERTY THAT THEY BOUGHT AND WRECKED VERMISCHTES NUMBER YEAH AND THEN PUT BACK ON THE MARKET WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THIS WOULD ALSO BE EXEMPT FROM SOME OF THE EXISTING CORPORATE- CAPITAL GAINS TAX THEY ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL- YOU KNOW. EXCHANGE LOOPHOLES- IF THE PROPERTY VALUES OUR PASSPORT SO IN ADDITION TO THE MYRIAD OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ALREADY- YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THESE CYCLES THESE HOUSING CYCLES AND IT THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST IS IN IN TERMS OF SUPPLY SIDE. OF HOUSES AND- YOU KNOW I I'LL I'VE ALSO SEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE SPECULATING- LOSE THEIR LIFE SAVINGS- THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT SPECULATING THERE'S THEY'RE GUESSING THAT IT'S GOING TO GO UP. AND WHEN IT WHEN THE MARKET IS LIKE IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT RAPID EQUITY RISE- A. B. YOU KNOW SURE THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THERE'S A WHOLE ECONOMY THAT LIVES OFF OF THAT BY THE WAY AND THERE THE WORKERS THERE THEIR PEOPLE TO GO IN AND- REDO THE WALLS A REDO THE FLOORING AND BRING THE HOUSE BACK UP TO. A LIVABLE CONDITION BASICALLY BEFORE THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT IT PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET AND HOPEFULLY MAKES ENOUGH TO COVER WHAT THE DAY SPENT- FIXING THE HOUSE UP- SO EASY THESE BILLS ARE A LITTLE SCARY TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE TRYING TO ADJUSTING MARKET ARTIFICIALLY- WHEN I THINK IT'S BEEN CLEARLY STATED THE PROBLEM WITH THE MARKET IS WE HAVE WAY LESS SUPPLY THEN WE HAVE DEMAND. AND WE HAVE TO FIX THAT SIDE. AND THESE THINGS DON'T FIX THAT. RIGHT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK- JUST TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT- THE OPPOSITION SAID WHICH IS UP YOU'VE EXEMPTED- OUR OUR OWNER OWNER OCCUPANTS THAT'S CORRECT YEAH SO ONE OF THE THINGS HE OPPOSITION RAISED IS NOT A CONCERN BUT WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO OWN ONE OR TWO HOMES- THE TYPE THAT- HE- MISTER GRAY MISTER ADAM GRAY THOUGHT. BROUGHT UP A WOULD THEY BE ACCEPTED AS WELL OR AS THE BILL'S IN PRINT- IT WOULD BE EXEMPTED FOR ANYBODY WHO TAKES THE HOMEOWNER EXEMPTION- WHICH OF COURSE IS YOU KNOW IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO ONE PROPERTY- I WILL SAY THAT ANNIE I'M SUFFERING PROPERTIES THAT WE NEED MORE RENTAL PROPERTIES AS WELL OR VACANCY RATE IS HORRIBLY LOW. ESPECIALLY IN SOME MARKETS- THAT WOULD BE A CHOICE WHEN YOU ARE ACQUIRING THAT PROPERTY IF YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HOLD ONTO IT FOR MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS YOUR YOUR HOME FREE BUT IF YOUR INTENT IS TO POSSIBLY GET AN AND- EXTRACT QUICK GAIN OUT OF THAT. YOU SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS- COUNTERACTED MANY WHAT ABOUT THESE FOLKS TO GO AND TAKE A HOME THAT'S IN TERRIBLE SHAPE AND THEN FIX IT UP- IN MY CLOTHES I DID WANT TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I MET WITH MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. OKAY SO YOU WOULD ADDRESS THAT THE OTHER THING THAT'S BROUGHT UP IN THE ANALYSIS IS CONCERNED THAT. PEOPLE WOULD IN FACT KEEP. KEEP THE HOMES ARE. OFF THE MARKET FOR SEVEN YEARS POSSIBLY. PROBABLY RENTING THEM. SO THAT THEY- BE LIVABLE SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW. A DECEPTIVE RAISE ANY CONCERNS FOR YOU. NOT IMMEDIATELY- I THINK THEIR PRODUCTS AND CERN'S OVER- INCREASED CORPORATE OWNERSHIP FOR PURPOSES A LONG TERM RENTALS AND THE INFLUENCE AT THAT CAN HAVE A RENTAL PRICING HOWEVER. WE NEED RENTAL HOUSING AS WELL THE VACANCY RATES THAT ARE HORRIBLY LOW TODAY ARE LARGELY WHAT IS DRIVING UP THE COST. OF RENTS AND SO- FOR THE PUPOSES OF THIS BILL I'M NOT TRYING TO GET AT THAT. WHAT I AM CONCERNED ARE IS INDIVIDUAL OR ANY ENTITY THAT IS ACQUIRING A PROPERTY SAY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN FLIPPING AT HOME- IMPROVEMENTS ARE NOT A FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION SHORT TIME LATER. BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE DOING IS A RAISING THE PRICE OF THAT SALE IF YOU SIT ON THAT PROPERTY FOR SEVEN YEARS. YOU'RE NOT AFFECTING THE PRICING OF HOMES. IN THAT REGION OKAY BUT YOU'RE ALSO NOT OBJECTING TO THE IDEA THAT. SOMEONE NON COULD BUY IT TO AVOID THE TAX. AND FOR SEVENTY AND THEREFORE PUT OR- NOT TAKE THE HOUSING OFF THE MARKET. WE NEED RENTAL STOCK AS WELL OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS- I THINK THAT IS ALL THE QUESTIONS CAN WE HAVE YOUR- FINAL WORDS PLEASE MISTER WARD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A LOT OF WORDS AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORKSHOP THIS MORE IS THAT CERTAINLY YEAR GOES ON BUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MEMBER COMMENTS AS WELL- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE- CLARITY IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NOT. INTENDED TO AFFECT HOMEOWNERS- THAT THERE IS- RENTAL HOME. RENTAL HOME AND HOME RENTAL HOME INVESTMENTS ARE GOOD- BUT TRYING TO EXERCISE A HOT MARKET TO EXTRACT THE EQUITY LEAVING THE NEXT HOMEOWNER WITH AN EVEN HIGHER PRICE TAG IS AFFECTING US ALL. MISTER CENTER RECENT ANSWER SOME OF YOUR OTHER POINTS I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE ON SUPPLY LEGISLATION IN FACT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE SOME OF THE BREAKTHROUGHS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DID ACHIEVE LAST SESSION LAST YEAR TO BE ABLE TO MOVE. FORWARD ON SOME PRODUCTION RELATED QUESTIONS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY- STYMIED- THIS BODY TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY PASS AND I KNOW YOU WERE SET PIVOTAL VOTE AND SOME OF THOSE AS WELL WE NEED TO BUILD ON TOP OF THAT AS WELL I DON'T DISAGREE. THE LARGEST PART THOUGH OF ACQUIRING SITES FOR DEVELOPERS LARGE COST OF DEVELOPMENT IS LAND ACQUISITION. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR- FEES OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OR LABOR COSTS OR OTHER ISSUES LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT THAT MORE THAN 60% OF THE TRANSACTION IS FINALLY IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD A LARGE PROPERTY THAT WAS SLATED FOR THREE THOUSAND HOMES IT WAS PURCHASED IT WAS WRONG LAND WAS PURCHASED FOR- TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO YEARS LATER IT WAS PURCHASED BY ANOTHER EQUITY FIRM FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN THAT EQUITY FIRM PASS IT ON TO A DEVELOPER FOR FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO YOU HAD A OF LAND AND ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO THOSE EVENTUAL RENTERS ARE HOMEOWNERS SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO GET AROUND SPECULATION SHORT TERM SPECULATION BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE COSTS. OF DEVELOPMENT NOW SEE THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS A PRESIDENT CAL. I MISS EARLIER SPECULATION IS HAPPENING WORLDWIDE. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE INSTITUTED A PROPERTY TAX MODEL JUST LIKE THAT JUST LIKE THIS- GERMANY NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND SOME CANADIAN PROVINCES. BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT THIS CAN ACTUALLY AFFECT BEHAVIOR- AND THEY PUT CONTROLS IN PLACE WITH VARYING TERMS. NOW THE REST OF CANADA THE UNITED KINGDOM AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE STUDYING THE SAME WITH A SERIOUS INTEREST. ON ENACTING POLICY AS WE OFTEN TOUT AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD CALIFORNIA. SHOULD BE EXPLORING THIS AS WELL. I THINK KNOWLEDGE THIS NEEDS WORK WE CANNOT ADVERSELY AFFECT SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION. NEEDS AND WE pPROPERTY. AND THEIR FEAR ARGUMENTS THAT HOME IMPROVEMENT SPECIALIST SOME CALL THEM FLIPPERS. NEED ACCOUNTING FOR. THESE ARE QUESTIONS I HOPE TO WORK ON WITH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE DISCUSSION OF IT GOT THERE BUT- THE CENTRAL REVENUE AND TAXATION QUESTION IS THIS. SHE WOULD BE USING OUR TAX POLICY. TO AFFECT A BEHAVIOR CHANGE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IS GREATEST NEED. IS IT WORTHY TO MOVE FORWARD. THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR MOVE FORD ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY ONE TO BRING CALIFORNIA HOME ACT. TO GENERATE APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SOURCE TO NEW TAX FOR BUSINESS REVENUE. HIS PROPOSAL. SEVENTY ONE MORE CLOSELY LINKS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS SOURCE FROM PERVERSE NEGATIVE ACTIVITY WHICH IS ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING. INFLATING HOUSING PRICING WHICH IN TURN IS CAUSING MORE PEOPLE TO NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT TODAY'S- TESTIMONY AS FOR TESTIMONY ONLY AND I DO APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WHETHER THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD OR NOT. THE PLEASE APPRECIATE THIS FOR ALL OF OUR WORK ON BROADER HOUSING SOLUTIONS. THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF MARKET FORECAST SUGGESTS THE HOUSING PRICES WILL AGAIN RISE BY DOUBLE DIGIT THIS YEAR. AND INVESTORS SPECULATORS WILL CONTINUE MAKING UP A GREATER SHARE OF THESE PURCHASES. WE WILL BE IN EVEN MORE DIRE HOUSING CONVERSATIONS THIS TIME NEXT YEAR IF WE KEEP DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND BECAUSE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES CALL FOR OUTSIDE THE BOX THINKING. I'M NOT GOING BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS TO TELL THEM I DIDN'T TRY. EVERYTHING THAT I COULD TO MAKE HOUSING MORE ATTAINABLE AND I APPRECIATE THIS QUESTION HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE YEAR AHEAD. ON IMPORTANT HOUSING CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR WARD. UP IN THE ABSENCE OF THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR I WAS ASKED.

WHILE EXPRESSING AN ABILITY AND DESIRE AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY MANY ADULTS AND YOUTH WITH DISABILITIES EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT WILL HELP SECURE AND SUSTAIN QUALITY JOB PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES BY PROVIDING QUALIFYING.

HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT R. DAVID LOPEZ WHO WILL SHARE HIS EXPERIENCE SECURING EMPLOYMENT TO AND DAVID. AND DAVID THE GENERAL MANAGER AT RECYCLING INDUSTRIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU LEGISLATION HI MY NAME IS DAVID LOPEZ AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS TESTIMONY ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SEVEN EIGHT I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND BELIEVE THAT IT WILL PROVIDE INCREASED OPPORTUNITY. FOR PEOPLE TO WORK AND EARN COMPETITIVE WAGE. THIS BILL. IT DEMONSTRATES THE INVESTMENT OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BY PROVIDING EMPLOYERS WITH THE TAX CREDIT. INCENTIVE WHEN THEY HIRE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. I AM CURRENTLY COMPETITIVELY EMPLOYED AND I HAVE I HAVE A DISABILITY MYSELF. I HAVE WORKED WITH ALL OF CALIFORNIA REGIONAL CENTER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT HELPS PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS. PROVIDING ADVOCACY SUPPORTS- TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MANAGEMENT TEAM AS WELL. MY EMPLOYER STANDS BEHIND COMPETITIVE AND- INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT BUT- SKEWS ME BUT THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYERS WHO DON'T FULLY HAVE THE BENEFIT OF KNOWING THE VALUE OF HIRING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE TAX CREDIT SHINES A LIGHT BRIGHTLY- ON THE POSSIBILITY AND SUPPORTS INCREASED JOB OPPORTUNITIES JOB PLACEMENT AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYERS TO DISCOVER FIRST HAND THE BENEFITS- EMPLOYMENTS EMPLOYMENT IS A GREAT EQUALIZER FOR PEOPLE WITH WITH THE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE COMPETITIVELY EMPLOYED AND HAVE INCREASED WAGES WHICH PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCESS TO BETTER HOUING AND MEDICAL CARE ESPECIALLY IN THESE DAYS. BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE- WITH THIS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITY AND SOCIETY IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. PLEASE VOTE ON ON AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU BOB DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS PART YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. YES SIR THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN FOR ALLOW ME COMMON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DAVID KUNIN. I'M THE GENERAL MANAGER OF RECYCLING INDUSTRIES WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA NORTH HIGHLANDS BOTH HAVE A PLACE UP IN YUBA CITY AND I'M FLANK BY MY DAD BEHIND ME HE STARTED IN OUR BACKYARD BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND SO HERE WE ARE ANY WORKS FULL DAYS EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD. SO I JUST WANNA TELL YOU THAT I THINK THIS BILLS ASSEMBLY- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT A GOOD PROGRAM OUR OUR COMPANY HAS OVER FIFTY EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. AND THE BIG WHY HERE IS THAT. IN OUR INDUSTRY AND RECYCLING WORK. CALLOSUM DESIGNATES US AS A HIGH HAZARD INDUSTRY. AND WE HAVE TO EXPEND. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ENGINEERING AND TRAINING AND EXTRA TIME TO BRING IN PEOPLE TO CARVE OUT A GOOD SORTING POSITION. FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT HOWEVER DOESN'T COME QUITE EASILY COMES AT A COST SO. I WOULD SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT WOULD ALLOW AT LEAST SOME SMALL LITTLE- CREDIT FOR US. AS WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT RISK IN THE IN THE TRAINING TRYING TO FIND THAT RIGHT FIT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE ON THE JOB. AND I THINK THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN APPROVE THIS BILL AND ALLOW US TO. KEEP IT. KEEP GOING IN THE IN THE TRAINING EFFORT EFFORT AND COMPENSATORS FORD AND SOMEWHAT SMALL FASHION WHICH I YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST A LITTLE BUT- IT'LL HELP- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE- BEEN ABLE TO DO IS- YEARS WE'VE HAD OPPORTUNITIES FOR. PEOPLE WITH AUTISM TO BE ABLE TO SORT. SPECIFIC TYPES OF ELECTRONIC WASTE WE FOUND THAT WORKING QUITE WELL WITH THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PEOPLE SORTING GARBAGE OFF OF OUR CARDBOARD LINE WHICH IS QUITE EASY- AND IT'S VERY REGIMENTED AND BEEN VERY FOCUSED. SO THE EXTENT WE CAN WORK YOU CAN WIND UP. I'M WIND UP. OR- TIME FOR COMMITTEE QUESTIONS- SO WITH THAT. I'M GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS I USUALLY ASK SO IS THIS INTENDED AS A REWARD BECAUSE I THINK RATHER THAN INCENTIVE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET THIS ARE PEOPLE WHO EMPLOY OUT LIKE YOUR RECYCLING CENTER EMPLOYEE THEM ALREADY AND I JUST- I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU GET THAT MANY MORE. PEOPLE EMPLOYING. THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR SUBSIDIZING THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE ALREADY SO WHAT IS THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL. IT REALLY IS- IN INCENTIVES AND- THAT MADE FIVE TELL YOU OF A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH. A FORMER SENATOR SHE HAD A SON WHO IS DISABLED AND THERE WAS A BILL THAT PASSED THE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT- REYES THE- MINIMUM WAGE FOR. SPECIAL NEEDS FOLKS AND HER SON LOST HIS JOB BECAUSE OF IT- SO THERE ARE MANY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE OPERATING VERY CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND REALLY DO HAVE BIG HEARTS BUT JUST CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT WITHOUT THAT LITTLE EXTRA INCENTIVE SO I DO THINK THAT A LOT MORE EMPLOYERS- WILL LOOK AT THE ADVANTAGES OF HIRING SOMEBODY WITH SPECIAL. WITH SPECIAL NEEDS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY FOR THE COMPANY BUT ALSO FOR ALL THE BENEFITS THAT IT GIVES TO OUR- NO FOR OUR TO OUR SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION OKAY AND I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE YET AS TO WHAT THIS WOULD COST. WELL I WILL ASK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS THERE AN ESTIMATE YET ON THE COST. PLEASE SHARE- THEN SHARED WE LISTED THERE IS- ESTIMATE OF- ON THE ANALYSIS YES WE YEAH- C. ACTUALLY MIGHT WITNESS POINTED OUT SEVEN SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS LIMIT ALSO OKAY- I'M SORRY I SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR ADD ONS ADD ON IN SUPPORT. A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING NETWORK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND IS THERE OPPOSITION THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY. AND THE ANSWER IS NO ALL RIGHT SO IT'S SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WELL I HOPE YOU CAN GET INTO THE BUDGET SO THAT THIS WILL GET OUT OF APPROPRIATIONS. I APPRECIATE THAT- MISTER ACTING CHAIR. YOU THANK YOU VERY ARE RIGHT- QUESTIONS HAVING BEEN ANSWERED- I THINK WE ARE NOW WAITING FOR MR GRAYSON AND FOR MEMBERS TO RETURN WHO HAVEN'T VOTED YET. HI. SCANNED SO IF MISTER GRATION OF MADAM CHAIR OF MR GRATION IS AUTHORIZED TO STAFF TO PRESENT SO PERHAPS THAT'S BEST WE DO THAT NOW. WE CAN HAVE. SO ALL RIGHT.

YEAH SHE TOOK A LONG TIME. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR BUYING TIME. THE OUR RIGHTS SO WE HAVE A AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. WHEN EVER YOU ARE THIS RACES GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER MEMBERS. THANK YOU DR COURT FOR STICKING AROUND- BEFORE I BEGIN THE PRESENTATION I DO WANT TO- THANK CHAIR IRWIN AND HER CHIEF CONSULTANTS TO ROUGH. FOR THE GUIDANCE AS WE WORK TO BRING SOMETHING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THAT ACTUALLY STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF ONE OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC DRIVERS AND THE NEED TO MAINTAIN FISCAL PRUDENCE. AS THE ECONOMY RECOVERS FROM THE RECENT PANDEMIC I AM YOU TOO ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH NARAL THE BILL TO EXPAND THE TO EXPAND THE CURRENT EXEMPTION FROM A PARTIAL EXEMPTION TO A FULL EXEMPTION REMOVING THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND A LIMIT ON PURCHASES ON QUALIFIED PER ON QUALIFIED PURCHASES. AND INCLUDE A REPORT BY THE L. A. O. TO EXAMINE THE IMPACTS OF A FULL EXEMPTION AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE SIX TWO AND SEND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS SPENT IN CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING A FULL SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR PER THIS OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT THIS WILL FACILITATE THE GROWTH HIRING. AND TRAINING OF SKILLED WORK FOR THE FUTURE PROVIDE WAGE JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS PRE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIANS MANUFACTURING SECTOR HAD ALREADY FACED A DECLINE IN TOTAL EMPLOYMENT MUCH OF THIS DECLINE HAS BEEN A RESULT OF CALIFORNIA'S COST OF DOING BUSINESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN NATION. COVERT AND DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR CHILD CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING. AND MAR OF TWENTY TWENTY MANUFACTURING JOBS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE DECREASED BY 4% AND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ATTRACTED LESS THAN 1% OF THE COUNTRY'S MANUFACTURING INVESTMENTS WITH OTHER STATES AGGRESSIVELY ATTEMPTING. TO LURE OUR STATE'S MANUFACTURES WITH ATTRACTIVE LOWER BUSINESS COST AND LOCATION INCENTIVES THIS BILL WILL HELP TO REVERSE THESE TRENDS AND MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTMENT. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT ARE YOU READY THAT THIRTY EIGHT STATES ALREADY HAVE A FULL SALES AND USE TAX EXEMPTION FOR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND ON THE FIVE STATES HAVE NO. HAVE NO SALES TAX- IT IS IMPERATIVE THE STATE FIND WAYS TO MITIGATE FINANCIAL BURDENS PROMOTE INCREASED PRODUCTION AND ENSURE THE GROWTH OF HIGH WAGE JOBS. FOR A VARIETY OF SKILL LEVELS AND BACKGROUNDS IN ONE OF THE STATE SPEECH CENTRAL IN HE'S- A STOUT MANUFACTURING JOB BASE. IS KEY TO THE GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE OF ITS BREATH AND BECAUSE OF ITS RATING. THERE IS A MISCONCEPTION THAT ALL MANUFACTURING IS DONE ON LARGE INDUSTRIAL SCALES. BUT OVER 70% OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE MANUFACTURERS FACE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ECONOMIC BURDENS INCREASED CAPITAL COSTS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND WHAT THE HIGHEST STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX RATES IN THE NATION. AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE WHAT TO EASE SOME OF THOSE ECONOMIC BURDENS CALIFORNIA HAS COMPARE MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGES TO REGION THE WORLD. DUE TO THE STRESS AND TO THE DEATH ITS INPATIENT. BUDGET NOT ONLY DOES INDUSTRY EMPLOYS ONE POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN. BUT A- KEY ROLE IN GETTING THE JOB WITH A SMALL. AFFECT SUPPORTING TO POINT FOR JOHN FOR A- MAY. JOB MANY. PLAYS A CRUCIAL AND ESSENTIAL ROLE WITHIN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY SUPPORTING HIGH WAGE JOBS SMALL BUSINESSES WITH ROOM FOR GROWTH IT IS MY HOPE THAT AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE CAN BE A TIPPING POINT. TO ENCOURAGE A NEW IN AN EVENT HERE MANUFACTURER HERE REALITY BY PROVIDING COMPANIES TO PLANT ROOTS IN OUR STATE AND TO GROW IN OUR STATE WITH THAT. I DO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN THE COMMITTEE TAKES ACTION ON THIS BILL AND WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY LANCE HASTINGS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GRAYSON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE THEM TO HAVE THE BILL HEARD BEFORE YOU TODAY AND THE- IN ADDITION TO WHAT EVERYTHING THAT. WE SHARED BY MR GRAYSON WERE THE FACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES WANT TO TAKE A LOOK BACK TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS DEEMED TO BE ESSENTIAL. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WORKING THROUGHOUT THOSE TWO YEARS HAS BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT AND A LOT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT WAS WITHHELD BECAUSE OF THE ANXIETY ABOUT THE FUTURE THIS BILL WE FEEL AS A CATALYST TO HAVING THAT INVESTMENT TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. AND I'M I KEPT AWAKE AT NIGHT BY TWO FIGURES THAT RECENTLY CAME OUT THE FIRST IS MANUFACTURING JOBS HAVE GROWN IN SEVENTH PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE JOBSREPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT FROM LAST MONTH. THAT REALLY SHOULD BE FIRST OR SECOND LET ALONE THIRD THAT WERE RANKED SEVENTH AT THE MOMENT AND THAT DOESN'T BODE WELL FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY THE OTHER IS MUCH MORE DAUNTING CALIFORNIA SECURES ONLY 1% OF ALL MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT IN THE COUNTRY. JUST 1% THAT MEANS ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE LITERALLY EATING OUR LUNCH. PARTICULAR SPACE. MANUFACTURING IS IN FACT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR FOR THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND WE THINK THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY pIMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SKIN IN THE GAME ALONG WITH US AND WE LOOK FOR TO BE HERE FOR A LONG TIME. WE CIRCULATED THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO ALL OF YOUR OFFICES LAST WEEK. WE HAVE A THIRD PARTY ANALYSTS HAVE SAID THAT THIS BILL WOULD COULD RESULT IN JOB GROWTH OF A HUNDRED SIX TREETOP. HOUSE THAT'S MORE THAN 10% OF THE CURRENT BASE IN MANUFACTURING AND ALSO GENERATE THREE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRODUCT. SO WE LOOK FOR TIERED SUPPORT REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT IF THERE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE'RE JOINED BY CAL TAX OUR FRIENDS. TODAY IF ANY OF THEIR ART I WOULD IMAGINE WORKING MISTER RUFF AND OUR STAFF. VERY AGGRESSIVELY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS COUPLE TO THE STILL MADE NEED ADDRESSING- RELATED TO USEFUL LIFE. BUT THIS CONVERSATION WILL AND HAVE CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT AND I AND I DO A PRE. TO WE WOULD LIKE ACCOUNTABILITY OF WITH THESE TYPE OF BILLS SO- GETTING THE L. A. O.'S REPORT WILL BE. CRITICAL IN IT YOU KNOW IF THIS GETS ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND- AT IN EXTENDING IT SO PRECIADO THAT YOU- TOOK THAT AMENDMENT THANK YOU MANAGE- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. I'M JOHN ARMENTA ROBERTS AND I'M WITH CAL TAX AND WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL I- WORKED AT PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AND KPMG AND I WAS AN AUDITOR WITH THE STATE SIDE I DEALT WITH THE CURRENT MANUFACTURING EXEMPTION SO THIS IS.

NECRO ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES EXPRESSING CONCERNS AND HOPING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH RIGHT THANK YOU A QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUICKLY YES SO ARE IN THE FIRST PART WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON YOUR MAKE YOUR MAJOR CHANGE. IS THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY SALES TAX. WOULD NO LONGER GO TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT. WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE STATE BUDGET YOU WON'T HAVE AS MUCH TROUBLE APPROPRIATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ALMOST ALWAYS SUBJECT TO THAT BUT THEY DIDN'T PUT IN A LETTER TO OBJECTIVE YOU WORKED CLOSELY WITH THEM WE ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TO WORK WITH OUR LOCALS- COMING FROM LOCAL MYSELF. SO WE ARE MAKING AN EFFORT TRYING TO- WORK OUT CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW THAT- OUR SPONSORS WORKING HEAVILY AS WELL IN THAT AREA SO IT'S SO WEIRD WE ARE COMPLETELY OPEN TO IDEAS AND COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS. TO CONTINUALLY MAKE% THIS BILL BETTER ALL RIGHT THE ONE THING THAT WILL HURT YOU AND APPROPRIATIONS IS LIFTING THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD COST US. BUT USED PARTICULARLY TALKED ABOUT SPOKE ABOUT- SO BUSINESS. RAISING THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOULD HELP. WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TESLA OTHER LARGER BUSINESSES. WHY DID YOU PARTICULARLY BRING THAT FORWARD KNOW LONGER LIMIT THE- AMOUNT PAID TO A SINGLE TAXPAYER TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT AND I WANTED YOU PARTICULARLY BRING THAT FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO HELP MAJOR BUSINESSES YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT SMALLER BUSINESS CORRECT AND AGAIN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS BORN OUT OF CONVERSATION AND NEGOTIATIONS AND- WOULD CONSTANTLY BE OPEN TO WORKING FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS. TO PERFECT THE BILL YEAH THAT'S FROM THING THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PROCREATION ABSOLUTELY YEAH OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU DR KIRK. AT THE MINUTE MAYBE MISTER HASTINGS YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE WHAT THE NEED WAS FOR THE- YEAH. FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S POINT IF YOU NEED A SECTOR WIDE BUT IT DOES SKEW MORE TOWARD THE SMALLER MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE WITHHELD INVESTMENTS FOR TWO YEARS AND THE WORKING WITH OLDER EQUIPMENT. AND WE'VE WE FEEL THAT THE SPURS REALLY GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN THAT PART OF IT AS MISTER GRAYSON STATED THERE MORE MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE WE JUST HAPPENED RECOGNIZE THE ONCE THE BRAND NAMES THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH. THAT OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND MANUFACTURES IN THE STATE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ARE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED BUT WHAT ABOUT THE NEED TO RAISE THE- TWO HUNDRED MILLION CAP WELL WE'D LIKE O BE ABLE TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO AS MANY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO SPUR THAT INVESTMENT SO. TO HER MILLIONS OF. HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY THIS BUT THAT'S A SMALL AMOUNT. OKAY ALL RIGHT I'VE- OKAY- THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST RESPECTFULLY WHAT YES ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A FEW COMMENTS MANUFACTURERS WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO REACH CALIFORNIA'S BOLD LEADERSHIP GOALS NCLUDING CARBON NEUTRALITY A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY AND RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY BUT MANUFACTURERS ESPECIALLY SMALL ONES ARE HAMPERED IN THEIR ABILITY TO BE PART OF THAT OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF SCALING UP PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. SO AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE IS UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO SEND A SERIOUS SIGNAL TO COMPANIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT ARE LOOKING FOR COST COMPETITIVE REASONS TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION THAT THEY CAN COMPETE HERE AND I KNOW FIRST HAND HAVING BEEN CONTACTED BY- AN AUTO MANUFACTURER OUT OF EUROPE THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE EAST COAST UNTIL THEY SAW THIS BILL AND THEY HAVE SENSE RECONVENED AND STARTED TO INCLUDE INTO THEIR DISCUSSION- MOVING TO THE U. S. IN CONSIDERING THE WEST COAST- BASED ON ON- THE MOVEMENT OF THIS BILL SO IT IS GARNERING GLOBAL ATTENTION. THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO HEAR. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. SIR. HI I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE CHOI HAS FILLED A AND THAT IS THREE THREE AND THEN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE ANNOUNCE THE OUTCOME OF THE- THE COMMITTEE'S AGENDA.
