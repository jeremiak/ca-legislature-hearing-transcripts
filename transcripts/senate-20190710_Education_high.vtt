00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.478

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.125
A PROBLEM?

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:20.259
THE DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.828

IN THE LA TIMES THERE WAS AN

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.743
ARTICLE ABOUT SCHOOLS SHARING.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.745
SPACE AND HOW THAT CAN BE A REAL

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.546
STRUGGLE IS PUSHING POLLS --

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.682
WITH REGARD TO THAT.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.017
A FURTHER THIS OF THE OVERSIGHT

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:44.984
OF THE CHARTER THAT IS BY AN

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.352
ENTITY THAT IS NOT LOCATED IN A

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.087
DISTRICT IN FACT MAYBE HUNDREDS

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.355
OF MILES AWAY.

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:51.290
PROVIDES A LACK OF OVERSIGHT

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.026

AUTHOR RISERS NINE HUNDRED MILES

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.131

OVERSIGHT.

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.200
SO WE WE CERTAINLY NEED TO

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.635
ADDRESS THAT FACT IN SAN DIEGO

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.270
IT WAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT ON

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.339
THE ASSEMBLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:06.606
STUDENTS.

00:05:06.673 --> 00:05:09.008
YET IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:09.642
TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS BECAUSE

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.678
IT'D AUTHORIZED SO MANY SO MANY

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:12.779
CHARTER OPERATIONS THAT THEY

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.714
COULD NOT PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:15.782
WHERE THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:16.182
NECESSARY.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.085
INFRASTRUCTURE SO COMMUNITY

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:19.886
IMPACT.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:20.787
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:22.321
ADMINISTRATORS NO THERE

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:23.589
DISTRICTS AND STUDENTS BEST AND

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:24.524
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.025
DETERMINE WHICH CHARTERS ARE

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.494
BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS.

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.996
THIS BILL GIVES DISTRICTS

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.798
GREATER FLEXIBILITY CONSIDER HOW

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.700
NEW CHARTER SCHOOL WILL IMPACT

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.268
THE COMMUNITY OF STUDENTS.

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:36.969
WE MUST ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICT TO

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:38.471
CONSIDER THE FISCAL IMPACT OF A

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.907
CHARTER SCHOOL MAY HAVE ON A

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:41.240
NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.176
PUBLIC SCHOOL.

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:44.711
AND ONCE CHARTERS ARE APPROVED

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.813
THE BILL ALLOWS AUTHORIZES TO

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.014
CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STABILITY

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.215
OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL DURING

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:50.650
RENEWAL.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:51.718
THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:53.419
HER TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.787
FISK TO A PHYSICAL PROBLEM

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.323
BEFORE IT BECOMES AN EMERGENCY

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.324
SO LET'S ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.726
UP FRONT.

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:00.359
AND LET'S ADDRESS SOME SOON SO

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:00.927
THEY DON'T REALLY BECOME A

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:03.596
PROBLEM AND THAT THAT CHARTER

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.431
WILL BE AUTHORIZED RE AUTHORIZED.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:06.165
WHEN THE CHARTER CERTAINLY

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.533
CLOSES ORDERED OR SHUT DOWN IT

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.102
IS DEVASTATING FOR STUDENTS AND

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.036
THEIR FAMILIES?

THIRTY TWO BEGINNING ON LINE

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:21.109
EIGHT THERE'S A WHOLE.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.310
STE OF EXAMPLES IN WHICH I GUESS

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:23.478
IN THE REVIEW OF A PROPOSED

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.547
CHARTER.

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:27.549
THAT -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:30.285
DETERMINED UNDER THESE STANDARDS.

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:33.187
THAT IT'S NOT -- APPROPRIATE --

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:37.659
DOES INCLUDE -- ON LINE -- EIGHT

01:26:37.725 --> 01:26:38.626
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.494
CHARTER SCHOOL WOULD

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:40.762
SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERMINED

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:43.565
EXISTING SERVICES.

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:45.533
AND THEN ON LINE -- TWELVE

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.068
WHETHER WITH DUPLICATED PROGRAM

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:48.536
CURRENTLY OFFERED.

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:50.104
AND IT GOES ON AND I GUESSONE

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:52.240
OF MY QUESTIONS IS IT SEEMS LIKE

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.608
IT'S REALLY AN OPEN DOOR TO JUST.

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.043
SAY THAT WE ALREADY HAVE A

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:57.779
SCHOOL HERE IN THE AREA. THIRTY

01:26:57.845 --> 01:27:00.248
OFFERING MATH AND ENGLISH SINCE.

01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.849
SOCIAL SCIENCES AND THE REST.

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:03.418
SEEMS TO JUST BE AN OPEN DOOR TO

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:06.487
JUST TO SAY NOW AND WONDER IF

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:08.356
THE ARTIST COULD COMMENT ON THAT.

01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:09.090
UNDER THE THE EFFORT HERE IS

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.326
THAT THE IMPACT BE SUBSTANTIAL

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:12.594
MEAN IT CAN'T JUST BE A DOLLAR

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.696
THE FISCAL IMPACT CAN'T JUST BE

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.397
A DOLLAR.

01:27:16.464 --> 01:27:17.332
PUT IT THAT IT -- SUBSTANTIALLY

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:18.633
UNDERMINES EXISTING SERVICES

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.503
ACADEMIC OR PROGRAMMATIC OFFERED

01:27:22.570 --> 01:27:24.138
OFFERINGS SO AGAIN.

01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:26.574
THE THE EMPHASIS OF THE BILL IS

01:27:26.641 --> 01:27:29.210
TO BRING BACK LOCAL CONTROL.

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:31.613
BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT THAT

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.982
LANGUAGE DOES GIVE A LOCAL BOARD

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.583
THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE --

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:38.486
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:39.087
AND AND AND STATUS.

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:40.555
THUS THE THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:42.523
LANGUAGE.

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:44.258
IN THE AREA AND THE COMMITTEE

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:46.628
ANALYSIS ON PAGE -- ELEVEN THE

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:49.664
COMMITTEE STAFF -- IN THE SECOND

01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:51.032
PARAGRAPH SAID THAT IN LOOKING

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.634
AT THIS.

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.569
THIS AUTHORIZATION CRITERIA IT

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.671
SAID.

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:57.739
DODD AND ASK THE QUESTION WITH

01:27:57.805 --> 01:27:59.641
THE OPTION OF THE NINE A CHARTER

01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:02.076
SCHOOL BASED ON A SUBJECTIVE --

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:03.845
ASSESSMENT OF THE FISCAL IMPACT

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:05.046
TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MET WROTE

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:06.781
RENDER MOST IF NOT ALL CHARTER

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:09.817
PETITIONS DENIABLE [inaudible]

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:12.487
I'M SORRY.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:12.954
WHAT'S THE QUESTION.

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:14.022
BY POINTING OUT THAT THE

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.189
ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE IS A

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:17.392
CANADIAN ANALYSIS ON PAGE.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.893
ELEVEN LOOKS AT THAT LANGUAGE

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.795
THAT I JUST REFERENCED.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.563
AND SAYS THAT IT'S THAT IT'S SO

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.532
SUBJECTIVE.

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:25.833
IN THE ASSESSMENT THAT IT WOULD

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.770
IT -- NOT RENDER -- MOST IF NOT

01:28:28.836 --> 01:28:30.705
ALL CHARTER PETITIONS DENIABLE

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.640
THAT'S THE CONCLUSION THAT THE

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:34.142
THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:37.378
HAVE MADE ABOUT THAT LANGUAGE.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:38.479
YES YES I SEE THAT MEAN OFFICER

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:40.114
I READ THAT WHEN I REVIEW THE

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:43.551
ANALYSIS AND BUT I THINK THAT

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.219
THE OFFICES RIGHT TO LOOK AT THE

01:28:45.286 --> 01:28:46.287
FACT THAT THERE WAS BOTH THE

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:47.722
OBJECTIVE COMPONENTS AND

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:48.289
SUBJECTIVE COMPONENT YOU'RE

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:49.624
FOCUSING ON THE THE SUBJECTIVE

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:51.325
COMPONENT.

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.528
AND THEY WERE.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.996
ARE SOME FOLKS WHO WOULD ARGUE

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.130
THAT YOU SHOULD REMOVE ANY

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:59.167
SUBJECTIVE -- DISCRETION FROM --

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:00.501
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LOCAL

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.136
SCHOOL BOARD WHOSE JOB IT IS TO

01:29:02.203 --> 01:29:03.337
LOOK OUT FOR THE BEST INTERESTS

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:04.706
OF THE CHILDREN FAMILIES

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:05.306
PARENTING COMMUNITIES IN THEIR

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:06.941
DISTRICT.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.009
AND IN SOME WAYS THIS IS A

01:29:08.076 --> 01:29:10.011
COMPROMISE BECAUSE IT REQUIRES A

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:11.079
HIGHER THRESHOLD OF OF

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.547
SUBSTANTIAL.

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:14.182
UNDERMINING IT'S NOT DE MINIMUS

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:15.650
UNDERMINING ITS NOT MINIMAL

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:17.151
UNDERMINING IT MUST BE

01:29:17.218 --> 01:29:19.053
SUBSTANTIAL AND SO IT IT'S

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.021
ACTUALLY A TRIGGER.

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.589
A HEIGHTENED TRIGGER IT'S

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:23.691
REQUIRED BEFORE I DETERMINATION

01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:25.460
CAN BE MADE ABOUT -- WHETHER CAN

01:29:25.526 --> 01:29:27.295
EVEN BE CONSIDERED AND THEN IT'S

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:29.197
A FACTOR AMONG MANY FACTORS AND

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:31.032
YES IF IF IT'S IF A SCHOOL

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.867
DISTRICT -- DESTRUCTIVE TERMS

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:33.901
THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.937
UNDERMINING THEY CAN CONSISTENT

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.673
WITH THIS LAW -- DECIDE THAT.

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.307
THEY DON'T WANT TO AUTHORIZE A

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:41.209
NEW CHARTER SCHOOL REMEMBER THIS

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:42.143
IS JUST FOR NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.344
ONE THAT DON'T EXIST RIGHT NOW

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:44.145
THERE'S NO KIDS ADAM NO ONE'S

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:45.480
LEARNING ANYTHING AT THEM

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:47.281
BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST YET --

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.649
BUT IT IS SO IT'S A PROSPECTIVE

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:54.155
GOING FORWARD BASIS -- AND YOU

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.156
NOTICE SOME FOLKS WOULD SAY THAT

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.023
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY AUTHORITY OF

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.091
A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD -- SO

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.292
THAT'S PART OF THE THE COULD THE

01:29:58.359 --> 01:29:59.260
COMPROMISE HERE TO HAVE THAT

01:29:59.327 --> 01:29:59.727
HEIGHTENED TRIGGER OF

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.162
SUBSTANTIAL UNDERMINING.

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.964
AND SO I O APPRECIATE THAT IT'S

01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:05.533
NOT A NEW ONES BUT THE

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.368
SUBSTANTIAL -- DIRECTION THE

01:30:07.435 --> 01:30:09.170
BUILD ONLY FOCUS ON NEW CHARTERS

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.838
AND NOT LOOKING BACK AND I THINK

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:13.908
THAT'S A MATERIAL -- FOCUS AND I

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:16.377
I ONE OF THE COLLEGES -- BUT I

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:18.546
ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT IT WE IN

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:20.214
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE.

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:21.315
HOW MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.151
CALIFORNIA NOW FACING FINANCIAL

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.318
CHALLENGES IT'S QUITE

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.586
SUBSTANTIAL AND I THINK MANY

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:27.655
WOULD SUGGEST THAT -- WHEN WENT

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:28.890
WHEN WE DIP INTO ANOTHER

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:30.691
RECESSION THAT THAT THAT THIS IS

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:31.893
GOING TO GROW QUITE QUITE QUITE

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:33.594
LARGE [inaudible]

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:36.264
AND AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE THAT

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.865
WE FACE THEY GO WAY BEYOND THE

01:30:37.932 --> 01:30:40.334
ISSUE OF CHARTERS -- WE DON'T

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:41.469
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING

01:30:41.536 --> 01:30:45.106
ABOUT THAT HERE -- BUT I YOU

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.307
KNOW ENROLLMENT DECLINES ARE

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:48.142
JUST ONE PART OF THE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:50.344
FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT THAT

01:30:50.411 --> 01:30:51.879
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.548
AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK AT OF THE

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:55.783
SIX MILLION.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.552
KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY.

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.187
HOW MANY SCHOOLS?

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:00.521
SCHOOLS A DOES THAT COMPRISE I

01:31:00.588 --> 01:31:02.523
DO KNOW THAT.

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.792
THAT THERE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:05.359
ONE THAT ARE CONSIDERED FOR

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.728
PERFORMING.

01:31:07.795 --> 01:31:08.296
SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE AND

01:31:08.362 --> 01:31:11.299
THAT'S ACROSS THE STATE -- AND

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:14.669
WHEN YOU LOOK AT SCHOOLS THAT

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.204
ARE GETTING TITLE ONE FEDERAL

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.104
AID BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME

01:31:17.171 --> 01:31:18.339
THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:20.041
SCHOOLS.

01:31:20.107 --> 01:31:21.609
THAT ARE POOR PERFORMING ACROSS

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:23.311
THE STATE AND OF THOSE ONLY

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.846
THIRTY FOUR CHARTERS.

01:31:24.912 --> 01:31:26.214
SO WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.382
FORTY SEVEN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS.

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:30.351
POOR PERFORMING AND I GUESS THE

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:31.686
THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR RAISING

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:35.456
THAT FACT ONE IS IS THAT.

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.924
THERE ARE A LOT OF PARENTS WHO

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:38.259
ARE FEELING PRETTY STRESSED

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:39.961
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:41.095
THAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:41.395
[inaudible]

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:45.366
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.434
ALTERNATIVES AND I THINK THE

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.102
SOME OF THE WITNESSES OF SPOKEN

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.703
ABOUT EARLIER WHEN THEY TALK

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.238
ABOUT LOSING A YEAR OF A CHILD'S

01:31:50.304 --> 01:31:52.406
LIFE.

01:31:52.473 --> 01:31:54.308
OR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS.

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:55.776
IT SAYS IT'S A BIG DEAL.

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.945
AND I I KNOW IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.614
THAT I I DO THINK IT'S WORTH

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.215
NOTING THAT THE GROWTH OF THE

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:02.650
CHARTER SCHOOL.

01:32:02.717 --> 01:32:03.784
THE CHARTER SCHOOL.

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.486
COMMUNITY IS A IS AN ELEMENT OF

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.989
PARENTS.

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:08.956
SAYING THAT I JUST DON'T WANT TO

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.892
LOSE ANOTHER YEAR OF MY CHILD'S

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:11.893
LIFE.

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:14.195
AND HERE WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:14.729
EIGHTY ONE FOR PERFORMING

01:32:14.795 --> 01:32:16.430
SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY IT'S

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:17.932
A LOT OF PARENTS PROBABLY.

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.267
PRETTY WORRIED.

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.501
AND SO EVEN THOUGH I ACKNOWLEDGE

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:23.070
THE VALUE OF LOOKING FORWARD ON

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:24.171
THE CHARTER SCHOOL.

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:25.439
ISSUE GOING FORWARD [inaudible]

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:27.775
I'D.

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:28.943
THAT'S A LOT OF PARENTS AND A

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.478
LOT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WORRIED

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:31.979
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THEIR

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:34.048
CHILD'S EDUCATION AND TRYING TO

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.783
FIND SOME ALTERNATIVE.

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.151
AND SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:39.020
FORWARD THINKING WITH THIS

01:32:39.086 --> 01:32:39.921
LEGISLATION.

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.022
IT'S DOING SO IN A WAY THAT

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.857
AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:44.659
PRETTY STRESSED OUT SO I GUESS

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:46.594
IT'S A POINT OF THE KNOWLEDGE

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.296
MEANT THERE.

01:32:48.362 --> 01:32:49.697
I DO THINK THE FINANCIAL HEALTH

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:50.998
OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS VERY

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:52.133
IMPORTANT AND I AND IF I WERE A

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.034
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND I THINK

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.268
ABOUT THIS IF I WAS ON THE

01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.102
SCHOOL BOARD.

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.204
AND I WAS LOSING ENROLLMENT AND

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.273
WE SEE IT IN OAKLAND I NOW.

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.341
WE SEE IT IN LOS ANGELES.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.876
AND AND WE READ ABOUT IN THE

01:33:01.943 --> 01:33:03.110
PAPER THE CHOICE IS THE THE

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.512
SCHOOL BOARDS ARE FACING TODAY

01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:05.379
AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.081
CHOICES AND I THINK IF I WERE

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:07.882
THERE.

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:10.952
WOULD I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO SAY.

01:33:11.018 --> 01:33:12.820
THAT SCHOOL THAT HAS LOST HALF

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:14.522
ITS ENROLLMENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:16.424
TO CLOSE IT AND CONSOLIDATE.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.559
THESE ARE VERY TOUGH CHOICES

01:33:18.626 --> 01:33:19.894
THAT I KNOW THE HARD CHOICES.

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:20.594
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:22.396
FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF A SCHOOL

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:23.764
DISTRICT WHICH THIS BILL THIS

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.232
BILL TOUCHES UPON IN A

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.867
SIGNIFICANT WAY.

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:28.202
THERE'S A LOT OF CHOICES THAT GO

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:29.637
INTO THAT FINANCIAL LIABILITY

01:33:29.704 --> 01:33:30.738
INCLUDING THE ABILITY OF THE

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:31.806
LEADERSHIP OF THE SCHOOL

01:33:31.872 --> 01:33:33.541
DISTRICT TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES.

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:36.077
IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.545
PART OF THAT CENTRAL NAY AND

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:38.646
PART OF THAT OUR COST INCREASES.

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.681
RETIREMENT COST INCREASES IN A

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.016
LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:42.850
AND SO I DO JUST WANT TO

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.385
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT ISSUE OF

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.753
FINANCIAL.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.622
IMPACT IS A VERY ELUSIVE ONE NOT

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.358
SO EASY TO PIN DOWN SUBJECT TO A

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.326
LOT OF SUBJECTIVE.

01:33:52.393 --> 01:33:54.695
AN ANALYSIS AND ALSO SUBJECT TO

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.664
A LOT OF A LEADERSHIP CHOICES

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:57.565
THAT ARE SCHOOL BOARDS ARE

01:33:57.631 --> 01:33:58.032
MAKING.

01:33:58.099 --> 01:33:59.767
I AM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:00.968
THEY FIND THEMSELVES.

01:34:01.035 --> 01:34:02.336
OF THE SECOND QUESTION I WANTED

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:03.637
TO ASK IS ABOUT ACADEMIC

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:05.006
ACHIEVEMENT.

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:08.376
I DO SEE THAT IN THE IN THE

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:10.144
REVIEW OF REASONS FOR REVIEWING

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:11.612
CHARTERS.

01:34:11.679 --> 01:34:13.881
THAT I DON'T SEE A LOT ABOUT --

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.816
WHETHER OR NOT.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:18.119
THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF THAT HAVE

01:34:18.185 --> 01:34:19.720
A COMMUNITY ARE BEING SERVED I'D

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:20.354
I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THE

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:22.490
AUTHOR OR OTHERS SPEAK TO THAT

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:24.091
ISSUE OF ACADEMIC NEED IN TERMS

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.794
OF HOW THEY ANALYZE THE NEED FOR

01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:28.629
CHARTERS.

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:29.497
BUT CAN YOU SAY THAT THE THE

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:31.265
ACADEMIC ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.234
ARE STILL A POINT OF DISCUSSION.

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.136
AS WE GO FORWARD.

01:34:35.202 --> 01:34:37.071
CAN YOU KIND OF DESCRIBE FOR ME

01:34:37.138 --> 01:34:38.472
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE THE

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:40.841
POINTS OF FIVE IN KOREA -- ABOUT

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:43.511
THAT IN REGARD TO THAT.

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:45.179
WHAT'S IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

01:34:45.246 --> 01:34:45.646
HOW WOULD YOU?

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:46.213
WHEN IT COMES TO RE

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.782
AUTHORIZATION HOW WOULD YOU

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:50.851
JUDGE A H. CHARTERS ACADEMIC

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.353
STANDING?

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.721
AND SHOULD A CHARTER THAT AS

01:34:53.788 --> 01:34:54.989
HIGHER ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:55.923
MAYBE ANOTHER.

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.491
HAVE A MORE REFINED PROCESS AND

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:59.560
MAYBE GET A A LONGER TIME

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:00.661
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE CHARTER

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:01.962
WOULD BE GRANTED FOR A LONGER

01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.631
PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT COMES

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.066
UP FOR REAUTHORIZATION.

01:35:05.132 --> 01:35:06.934
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME OF THE

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:07.568
POINTS FOR DISCUSSION TO BE HAD

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:09.003
THERE AS WELL.

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.637
I'M REALLY I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:11.972
AND I DO THINK THAT WITH

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:12.973
EXISTING CHARTERS AND THE

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.375
RENEWAL PROCESS THAT.

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:16.177
AND WE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE

01:35:16.243 --> 01:35:17.645
WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ABOUT.

01:35:17.711 --> 01:35:18.813
THE HIGH QUALITY CHARTER THAT

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:20.314
SHE'S LEADING AND AND HOW WELL

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.716
IT'S DONE AND THAT IF WE'RE

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:24.418
TRYING TO FIND DIFFERENTIALS.

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.519
I MET THE QUICK IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:26.921
PART OF THAT THE ESSENCE OF ALL

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:28.489
THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS TO TRY

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.957
TO FIND THE BAD APPLES.

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.325
THOSE CHARTERS THAT ARE NOT

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:33.160
DOING THEIR JOB CORRECTLY AND I

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:35.229
THINK THAT'S A FAIR AT POINT OF

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:37.865
INQUIRY IN AND POINT OF WORK

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:38.432
BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS THAT I

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:41.001
DON'T WANT -- BAD.

01:35:41.068 --> 01:35:43.003
PUBLIC CHARTERS -- TO TO BE

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.338
FEELING OUR KIDS IS THE SAME WAY

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.739
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE BAD

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:47.007
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:48.242
FAILING OUR KIDS SO.

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.077
THAT I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:51.278
POINT EMPHASIS SO WHERE.

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:54.748
THERE IS -- FOCUS ON OR LACK OF

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.717
FOCUS OR NO NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:59.186
HIGH QUALITY -- CHARTERS THAT

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:00.321
OUR DIVERSITY SERVING THE

01:36:00.387 --> 01:36:02.323
ACADEMIC NEEDS WELL I THINK

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:03.591
THAT'S A I'M GLAD TO HEAR THT.

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:04.959
YOU'RE TAKING A CAREFUL LOOK AT

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:06.527
THAT AND I GUESS I WOULD SAY

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:08.829
THAT THE SAME FOR FUTURE CHARTER

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:09.563
SCHOOLS THAT.

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:12.500
NO WE'RE YOU HAVE FAILING

01:36:12.566 --> 01:36:14.502
SCHOOLS IN A COMMUNITY -- AND

01:36:14.568 --> 01:36:15.636
WE'RE CHARTER I PROPOSE CHARTERS

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.770
PROVIDE AT THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:18.772
GREATER ACADEMIC OUTCOMES I HOPE

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:20.307
THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT.

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:21.375
TOO BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO BACK AND

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:23.544
YOU LOOK AT THIS LIST OF SEVEN

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:24.044
HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POOR

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:24.612
PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS TO BIG

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:29.049
NUMBER -- IDOL I WANT TO GO OUT

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.484
TO THE POOR PERFORMING CHARTERS.

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.919
TO BUT YOU KNOW IT IS A

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.587
CIRCUMSTANCE WE WE DO FIND

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:34.421
OURSELVES AND MATT I'M SURE I

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:35.623
KNOW I'VE TAKEN A LOT OF TIME

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:39.927
BUT MAYBE A FINAL OBSERVATION.

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:40.761
THE NOT A TIME THAT WE SPENT

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:42.530
TODAY TALKING ABOUT ONE PART

01:36:42.596 --> 01:36:44.431
ABOUT OUR OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:45.733
THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL PART

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:47.601
EARLY IN THIS CASE THE FUTURE

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:50.471
PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL PART -- IT

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:52.006
SO OVERWHELMS THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:54.175
WE SPENT TALKING ABOUT OUR POOR

01:36:54.241 --> 01:36:55.342
PERFORMING.

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:56.143
TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN

01:36:56.210 --> 01:37:00.080
OUR STATE -- WE SPEND ALMOST NO

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:03.150
TIME -- HERE IN THE SENATE --

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:05.686
TALKING ABOUT OUR ENGLISH.

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:08.722
SCORESOR ARE MATH SCORES ARE

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:10.724
SOCIAL SCIENCE SCORES -- AND WE

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:12.626
HAVE.

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:13.861
A FAILURE AGAINST FAILURE

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.029
AGAINST FAILURE ALL ACROSS THE

01:37:15.095 --> 01:37:15.996
STATE.

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.464
NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE GREAT

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:18.199
TEACHERS AND GREAT

01:37:18.265 --> 01:37:19.099
ADMINISTRATORS AND

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.801
SUPERINTENDENTS COOL BOARDS BUT

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.136
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:24.205
AND YET WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:26.040
THIS COMMITTEE AND TODAY.

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:27.007
FOCUSED ON ONE LITTLE ELEMENT OF

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:27.641
IT.

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.643
AND SO I THINK THAT OBSERVATIONS

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:30.211
ONE I HOPE WE TAKE THE HEART

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:32.246
THAT WE DO WE ALL FEEL THIS

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:35.349
ISSUE OF OUR STUDENTS EDUCATION

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:36.884
HOW WE ADVANCE IT AND HOW WE GO

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:38.185
AFTER PLACES WHERE IT'S NOT

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.887
WORKING RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.388
THE INTENT OF THE AUTHORS.

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.057
BUT BUT WE WE ALL SHARE I THINK

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:46.427
IN THAT -- LACK OF ATTENTION ON

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:48.495
THE BROADER FOCUS OF OF FAILURE

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:50.397
AND POOR PERFORMANCE AND HELP

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:52.700
THAT WE CAN -- COLLECTIVELY AND

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:53.801
I SAY TO MYSELF AS TO OTHERS.

01:37:53.867 --> 01:37:55.636
I TRY TO DO BETTER THIS IS THE

01:37:55.703 --> 01:37:57.204
IDENTIFYING SOME ISSUE OF

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.539
CONCERN I GRANT YOU THAT BUT I

01:37:58.606 --> 01:38:00.341
HOPE THAT.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:01.809
IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:03.277
MORE IMPORTANT FOCUS.

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.279
ON A BROADER RANGE OF FAILURES

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:08.048
AND AND THAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:08.782
SOMETHING ABOUT SO THANK YOU FOR

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:09.550

THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER AND AS I

01:38:10.651 --> 01:38:11.652
STATED WHEN WE BEGAN THE

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.187
COMMITTEE ONE BILL WILL NOT FIX

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:15.723
EVERYTHING THIS IS A STEP IN THE

01:38:15.789 --> 01:38:16.991
RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT WE HAVE A

01:38:17.057 --> 01:38:20.527
LOT OF WORK TO DO SENATOR WILK.

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:23.130

TOO MUCH TIME AT ALL IN FACT OUT

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.436
MY COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS ALIGN

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:30.704
ALIGN WITH YEARS I DID ONE ASSET

01:38:30.771 --> 01:38:32.539
POINTS TO A COUPLE THINGS JUST

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:33.874

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:38.279
PUBLIC.

SCHOOL CHARTER EMPLOYEES GET

01:38:40.814 --> 01:38:42.750
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES --

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:47.354
EXISTING STATUE REQUIRES --

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.322
FINGERPRINTING AND BACKGROUND

01:38:48.389 --> 01:38:50.591
CHECKS FOR ALL TEACHERS IN

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.226
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THERE'S A

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:54.328
CROSS REFERENCE TO EXISTING

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:55.029
STATUTE.

TWENTY NINE LINE THIRTY SIX IT'S

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:04.204
A CROSS REFERENCE.

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:04.838
TO FOUR FOUR TWO THREE SEVEN BUT

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:06.373
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CURIOUS ABOUT

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.409
THE EXAMPLES THAT THE CHAIR OF

01:39:08.475 --> 01:39:09.043
THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:12.279
HAS SURFACED AND VIGILANT ABOUT

01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:14.315
ANY EXAMPLES IN VIOLATION OF

01:39:14.381 --> 01:39:16.050
EXISTING LAW.

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:16.917
A GREAT THANK YOU ANOTHER THING

01:39:16.984 --> 01:39:19.687
THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS A LACK OF

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:21.288
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND NAM MY

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.956
UNDERSTANDING IS COR.

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:24.858
CORE SUBJECTS TEACHERS HAVE TO

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.060
BE CREDENTIALED SO IT'S FOR

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:27.961
OTHER THINGS WERE THOSE ARE STEM

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.698
EDUCATION CAN YOU AND THE

01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:31.799
COUNCIL ATTY.

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:34.001
SO -- AS MISTER O'DONNELL --

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:35.202
INDICATED IN HIS REMARKS THAT

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:37.071
THIS ISSUE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:39.039
NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:43.577
RESOLVE -- AT BECAUSE WE ARE ON

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.913
POLAR OPPOSITES OF THIS QUESTION

01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:48.916
AROUND -- WHAT LEVEL OF

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:50.484
CERTIFICATE OR CLEARANCE --

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:51.752
CREDENTIALING THAT CHARTER

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.687
SCHOOL TEACHERS IN NON CORE AND

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.223
NON COLLEGE PREP COURSES SHOULD.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:57.791
HAVE TO ABIDE BY AND THAT'S

01:39:57.858 --> 01:40:01.061
BECAUSE THIS IS A CORE PILLAR OF

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:03.063
THE CHARTER MODEL THAT WE CAN

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:05.699
PULL FROM BORROW FROM -- THE

01:40:05.766 --> 01:40:07.401
TALENTS WITHIN A COMMUNITY OF

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.869
PROFESSIONALS WHO MAY NOT HAVE

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.371
MADE IT IT'S THEIR LIFE'S WORK

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:11.505
TO BE.

01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:13.474
A CLASSROOM TEACHER BUT WHO

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:14.975
STILL MAY HAVE VALUE.

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:15.943
THAT THEY CAN BRING TO THE

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:17.678
CLASSROOM THIS IS WHAT WE

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.012
BELIEVE IS PART OF THE SECRET

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.281
SAUCE OF WHAT MAKES CHARTER SO

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:22.616
GREAT AND SO FOR US.

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.318
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.819
EXISTING SCHOOLS AND FUTURE

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:28.288
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:29.156
COMPLETELY HOLLOWED OUT.

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:30.891
THAT FROM BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.326
THESE CORE FLEXIBILITY SURROUND

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:33.560
CREDENTIALING BUT WE THINK THAT

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.562
THERE'S A PATH FORWARD THE

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.331
LANGUAGE IN PRINT BEFORE YOU IS

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.266
CERTAINLY OUR PREFERENCE WE

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:40.534
RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR.

01:40:40.601 --> 01:40:42.536
HAS HIS PREFERENCE AND WE HOPE

01:40:42.603 --> 01:40:45.439
TO CONTINUE TO WORK -- TO FIND A

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.807
LANDING SPOT THERE.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.208
I JUST WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT --

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:49.476
UNDER THE CURRENT ITERATION OF

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:51.111
THIS BILL OF A COLLEGE PROFESSOR

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.613
FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAD HAVE YOU

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:54.381
KNOW A PHD IN INTERNATIONAL

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:55.382
STUDIES BUT NOT.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.284
A TEACHING CREDENTIAL WOULD BE

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:58.385
EXEMPT FROM TEACHING IN OUR

01:40:58.452 --> 01:41:00.621
CHARTER SCHOOLS SO I THINK WE

01:41:00.687 --> 01:41:01.755
HAVE TO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.424
KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.058
OF IF TRYING TO DIVERSIFY THAT

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:05.893
EDUCATION.

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:10.731
BUT STILL PROVIDES EXPERTISE.

01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:13.133
IN MENTOR MAYOR.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.003
ON THAT ON THAT TOPIC IN IN. TO

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.104
TO TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A POINT

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:17.971
OF CONTINUED CONVERSATION BUT

01:41:18.038 --> 01:41:19.106
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT EVERY

01:41:19.173 --> 01:41:19.706
TEACHER SHOULD HAVE A TEACHING

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:20.007
CREDENTIAL.

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:20.874
EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE THE

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.276
ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A TRAINED

01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:24.945
TEACHER WHO HAS GONE THROUGH --

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.146
AND I DID AND IT THAT YOU'VE

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:27.981
GONE THROUGH THE TEACHER

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.450
PREPARATION PROGRAM THAT'S

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:31.718
FUNDAMENTAL TO MY BELIEFS -- IN

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.020
THE BACKGROUND CHECKS I THINK

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:33.720
EVEN THERE I THINK WE DON'T

01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:34.988
AGREE ON WHAT A FULL BACKGROUND

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.690
CHECK IS I THINK THEY SHOULD GO

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:38.225
THROUGH THE FBI CHECK. FOR

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:38.892
INSTANCE THEY COME FROM ANOTHER

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:40.060
STATE MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:41.829
GOING ON THERE SO WE WE NEED WE

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:43.130
DO NEED TO FIX THIS.

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:44.598
AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR COLLEGE

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:45.666
PROFESSOR THAT THAT MIGHT MEAN

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:47.201
YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT HISTORY BUT

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:48.669
THAT DOESN'T MEAN.

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:49.870
YOU KNOW HOW TO TEACH HISTORY

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:52.906
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WALK

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:54.541
INTO A MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM.

01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:55.709
AS A LONGTIME MIDDLE SCHOOL

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:58.078
TEACHER AND I'VE SEEN THEM FAIL

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.780
MISERABLY THEY HAD A YOU KNOW A

01:41:59.847 --> 01:42:01.348
LOT OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:03.584
BUT NOT NECESSARILY AN ABILITY

01:42:03.650 --> 01:42:04.351
TO WORK WITH KILL THERE'S A

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:05.819
SPECIAL PLACE IN HEAVEN FOR

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:06.453
MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHERS ON AUG

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:09.656
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT I DO NOT LIKE

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.658
TO SPEAK TO EIGHTH GRADERS.

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:12.893
IT AGAIN NON CORE CAN ALSO MEAN

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.194
SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.462
SO WE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IN

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:17.197
PARTICULAR.

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:18.565
OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS

01:42:18.632 --> 01:42:19.633
THE SICK CALIFORNIA HAVE THE

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:20.834
ADVANTAGE OF ANY TRAINING SCHOOL

01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:24.004
TEACHER IN THAT ROOM SO I SOME

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:24.771
ASSUME WANTED ADVANTAGES TO THE

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:25.639
CHARTER SCHOOL HAS OVER

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:27.140
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL.

01:42:27.207 --> 01:42:29.610
IS BECAUSE OF THE WIND FOLLOW

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.645
ELIMINATION PROVISION FOR SO

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:32.980
SOURCES CARRY WERE HAVING A HARD

01:42:33.046 --> 01:42:35.582
TIME RECRUITING STAND TEACHERS

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.383
AND AND PEOPLE THOSE VARIOUS

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:37.417
BACKGROUNDS WE'VE ALREADY HAD A

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:38.785
SUCCESSFUL CAREER.

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.821
BECAUSE THE SO SECURITY SYSTEM

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:41.622
DINGS THEM FOR THAT SO IT'S

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:43.023
PROBABLY EASIER FOR YOU GUYS TO

01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:47.327
RECRUIT THOSE THAT KIND OF

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:48.996
TALENT TO YOUR SCHOOL'S CORRECT --

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:51.565
IT YET UNDER EXISTING

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.100
FLEXIBILITY RIGHT UNDER OKAY.

01:42:53.166 --> 01:42:54.034
IN MY FINAL THING AND AND THE

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.736
SURPLUS ALREADY TOUCHED ON IN

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:57.037
TERMS OF THEIR SORRY I MEAN

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:58.639
CURRY THIS TENSION BECAUSE

01:42:58.705 --> 01:42:59.273
EVERYBODY WANTS THE MONEY AND I

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:00.173
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT SEEMS TO

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:00.741
ME IS GONNA BE EXASPERATED.

01:43:00.807 --> 01:43:03.143
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD A HISTORIC

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:05.312
ECONOMIC GROWTH THE GOVERNOR

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:06.980
ARNOLD GOVERNESSES SAY IS NOT

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:07.948
GOING TO LAST FOREVER DESPITE

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:08.348
NOT.

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:12.085
AND THEN EVERYBODY HERE THE DICE

01:43:12.152 --> 01:43:14.021
KNOWS WE HAVE A PENSION BOMB.

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.889
THAT'S ABOUT TO THE TO GO OFF SO

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:16.823
IT SEEMS TO ME IS I'M READING IT

01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:18.025
THIS IS PRETTY SUBJECTIVE AND I

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:19.493
HAVE CONCERNS THAT.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.128
EARLY NO CHARTER SCHOOL.

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:24.097
WOULD -- B. B. AUTHORIZE BECAUSE

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:25.532
THEY'RE SO CONCERNED I KNOW L.

01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:26.833
A. U. S. T. AND I'M I PRAISE AND

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:27.901
OUT LIAR THEY JUST SIGNED A

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:29.202
CONTRACTOR LATER THISYEAR WITH

01:43:29.269 --> 01:43:30.938
THEIR TEACHERS THAT WE ALL KNOW

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.306
THAT THEY CAN'T TO FILL.

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:34.308
IN SO THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING I

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:36.276
GUESS TO HEAR WHEN IT WANTING A

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:38.211
BAIL OUT BUT I JUST WANTED TO

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:39.680
KNOW WHAT YOUR VIEWS WERE IN

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.281
TERMS OF THE THE FINANCIAL

01:43:41.348 --> 01:43:43.483
VIABILITY ASPECT OF THE

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.685
LEGISLATION.

01:43:44.751 --> 01:43:45.786
WELL -- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:48.422
THIS IS AGAIN A WORK IN PROGRESS --

01:43:48.488 --> 01:43:50.457
AND APPLAUD THE THE THE THE

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:52.359
GROUND IS ALREADY BEEN LAID TO

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:53.994
GET US TO THIS POINT.

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:56.096
BUT TERE'S REALLY TWO TYPES OF

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.664
DISTRICT DISCRETION FOR THE

01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:59.199
PURPOSES OF FISCAL IMPACT

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:00.734
CONSIDERATION IN THE BILL

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:01.435
IMPRINT.

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:03.036
THERE IS THE TREATMENT FOR

01:44:03.103 --> 01:44:04.271
DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN NEGATIVE

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.505
CERTIFICATION AND STATE

01:44:05.572 --> 01:44:06.974
RECEIVERSHIP.

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.909
AND ALSO A BROADER UNIVERSE OF

01:44:08.976 --> 01:44:11.144
DISTRICTS THAT ARE.

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:12.379
QUALIFIED BUT WHERE THE OUNTY

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:14.448
SUPERINTENDENT IN CONSULTATION

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:16.617
WITH THICK MAT HAS DETERMINED

01:44:16.683 --> 01:44:18.385
THAT THIS ONE CHARTER SCHOOL

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:20.787
COULD PUT THAT DISTRICT OVER

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:22.789
INTO NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION.

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:24.558
AND FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THEY CAN

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.526
HAVE WHAT'S CALLED A REBUTTABLE

01:44:26.593 --> 01:44:28.195
PRESUMPTION OF DENIAL WHICH IS A

01:44:28.261 --> 01:44:28.996
BROADER.

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:30.931
DISCRETION THAN ALL OTHER

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:32.299
DISTRICTS WOULD ENJOY.

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:33.734
BUT OF COURSE THE PETITIONER

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:35.669
COULD STILL READ BY THAT WE ARE

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:37.437
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH PART OF THAT

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:38.405
WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:39.806
THAT.

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:41.742
THE SECOND TIER OF DISTRICTS

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:43.510
THAT WILL HAVE ANOTHER STANDARD

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:45.078
OF DISCRETION IS THIS MULTI

01:44:45.145 --> 01:44:47.314
FACTORIAL LISTS THAT YOU SEE

01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:48.081
BEFORE YOU.

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:50.584
AND THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TODAY

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:53.186
IS THAT AGAIN THE DISTRICTS CAN

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.454
SIMPLY DENY A CHARTER SCHOOL

01:44:54.521 --> 01:44:56.957
BASED ON AN EXISTING PROGRAM

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.759
THAT THE DISTRICT IS RUNNING.

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:00.460
AS LONG AS IT'S IN REASONABLE

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:02.195
PROXIMITY TO WHERE THE CHARTER

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:03.864
IS LOCATED AND SAY WE ALREADY

01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:04.731
HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THAT WE'RE

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:05.732
GONNA DENY IT.

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:06.967
AND WE HAVE ISSUES WITH THAT

01:45:07.034 --> 01:45:09.536
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM MIGHT NOT BE

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:11.238
SERVING KIDS TO EXCELLENCE THE

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:13.040
OTHER PIECE THAT WE HAVE ISSUES

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:13.740
WITH IS THAT.

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:14.908
LANGUAGE NOW SAYS THAT FISCAL

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:17.577
IMPACT CAN ALSO BE CONSIDERED IN

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:18.712
THE CONTEXT OF DISTRICTS THEY

01:45:18.779 --> 01:45:20.380
DON'T HAVE ANY CHARACTERISTICS

01:45:20.447 --> 01:45:21.748
AROUND FISCAL DISTRESS.

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:23.517
AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WELL

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:24.885
WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE TO

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.553
BALANCE OUT THAT FACTOR WITH

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.255
ACADEMIC NEED BEFORE GOING TO

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:29.990
EMPHASIZE FISCAL IMPACT IN THE

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:31.558
CONTEXT OF DISTRICTS THAT DON'T

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:32.759
HAVE FISCAL DISTRESS.

01:45:32.826 --> 01:45:34.294
THEN WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THE

01:45:34.361 --> 01:45:36.263
FACT THAT THOSE SAME DISTRICTS

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.831
ARE IN ACADEMIC DISTRESS AND

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:38.732
WHERE THEY ARE.

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:39.866
I THINK THE CHARTER SCHOOL WE

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:40.434
BELIEVE THE CHARTER SCHOOL

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.035
PETITIONER SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:45.172
MAKE THE CASE THAT.

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:47.140
THAT VAL YOU IN AND OF ITSELF

01:45:47.207 --> 01:45:47.841
COULD POTENTIALLY OUT WAY THE

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:49.176
OTHER FACTORS AND ACTUALLY MIGHT

01:45:49.242 --> 01:45:52.379
HAVE A STRONGER CASE UPON REVIEW

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:54.114
BY THE COUNTY -- SO SO FOR US

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:56.183
THE THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT WE

01:45:56.249 --> 01:45:57.484
HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH.

01:45:57.551 --> 01:45:58.719
GREAT I GOT ONE FINAL QUESTION

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:00.420
BEFORE I DO THAT I DO WANT TO

01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:01.388
THANK THE AUTHORS.

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.090
YOU KNOW THIS IS A CONTENTIOUS

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:05.192
ISSUE AND I THINK I THINK THERE

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.560
ARE SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO BE

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:09.362
TOO WEAK TO TO MAKE IT BETTER SO

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:09.930
I I APPLAUD YOU FOR ALL YOUR

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:10.797
EFFORTS.

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:11.598
SO -- WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT

01:46:11.665 --> 01:46:12.933
ACCOUNTABILITY FROM MY

01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:15.035
PERSPECTIVE.

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:16.236
PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ACTUALLY

01:46:16.303 --> 01:46:17.771
HAVE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:19.773
PEOPLE OPT IN.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.541
AND THEY CAN OPT OUT SO LIKE

01:46:21.608 --> 01:46:22.409
CENTER CLOSE TO MATCHING THE THE

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:24.377
BAD APPLES IF YOU'RE IN A

01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:26.113
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL.

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.748
AS BAD YOU'RE STUCK OR WHEN

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:28.648
YOU'RE SCHOOL.

01:46:28.715 --> 01:46:30.817
PARENTS CAN OPT AMOUNTS SO I

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:31.852
THINK YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:33.854
ACCOUNTABILITY IN MANYRESPECTS

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:34.855
BECAUSE THE MARKET PLACE.

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.690
I'LL HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE SO

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.557
JUST ANY.

01:46:37.624 --> 01:46:39.860
WRAPAROUND THOUGHTS ON THAT AND

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:41.995
THEN I WELL DONE AND I'LL BE

01:46:42.062 --> 01:46:43.330
I'LL BE BRIEF -- MADAM CHAIR SO

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:45.465
THAT -- THEY THEY COUNSELING --

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:47.067
OUT -- ABOUT GUARD RAILS THAT

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:49.436
THE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:51.338
PLACING HIS TRAILER BILL THIS

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:51.938
YEAR.

01:46:52.005 --> 01:46:54.107
THE BAN ON FOR PROFIT CHARTERS

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:55.742
THAT -- WE SUPPORTED THE

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.043
STRENGTHENING OF STUDENT

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.845
ADMISSIONS INTO PROCESS RIGHTS

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.413
IN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT MR BONTA

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.082
OFF AUTHORED THAT WE ULTIMATELY

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:04.518
SUPPORTED -- AT ALONG WITH THE

01:47:04.584 --> 01:47:06.520
FACT THAT YES WE FACE A FIVE

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.221
YEAR RENEWAL PERIOD -- AT THE

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:09.055
END OF WHICH WE COULD

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.323
POTENTIALLY BE CLOSER FOR NOT

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:11.858
PERFORMING.

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.794
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE ARE A

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.129
WHOLE LOT OF WRITTEN WAYS IN

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:16.663
WHICH YOU CAN HOLD CHARTER

01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:17.831
SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE.

01:47:17.898 --> 01:47:19.699
TODAY AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:21.234
ANALYSIS AROUND THE SCHOOL

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.869
ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.971
THE STATE HAS ADOPTED BEING USED

01:47:25.038 --> 01:47:27.174
IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.708
FOR CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT -- BUT

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.010
IN THE HIGH STAKES ENVIRONMENT

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:32.012
OF RENEWAL AND POTENTIAL SCHOOL

01:47:32.078 --> 01:47:33.313
CLOSURE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:36.016
THAT'S THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE

01:47:36.082 --> 01:47:36.349
PARITY.

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.651
YEAH IT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING

01:47:37.717 --> 01:47:39.486
THAT WE CAN PURSUE AND TERMS OF

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:41.822
THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BUT

01:47:41.888 --> 01:47:42.989
IT'S A PROBABLY AT SOMETHING WE

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:44.691
CAN GET PERFECTLY BECAUSE WE

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:45.425
HAVE TO MAKE.

01:47:45.492 --> 01:47:47.494
IT A COMEDY FOR THOSE HIGH

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:52.299
STAKES RENEWALS THE CHARTERS

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:54.034
HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.236
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MADAM

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:57.871
CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR WILK.

01:47:57.938 --> 01:48:00.473
CENTER DRAWS THEM.

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:02.409
YES I I TO WANT TO THANK THE

01:48:02.475 --> 01:48:03.176
AUTHORS IN.

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:04.811
THE CHARTER SCHOOL LEADERSHIP --

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.679
FOR PUTTING ALL THE ENERGY AND

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:07.981
TIME INTO INTO THIS -- YOUR

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:09.482
BREAKING GROUND BUT

01:48:09.549 --> 01:48:11.484
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BREAKING

01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:12.886
GROUND TO CATCH UP. TO CATCH UP

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:14.888
ON ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:19.693
BEEN DEALT WITH FOR DECADES NOW --

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.595
KINDA REMINDS ME OF A IN

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:24.030
JUDICIARY WERE TRYING TO TACKLE

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:25.866
THE ISSUES OF PRIVACY.

01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:28.768
IN YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY WHEN IT'S

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:30.503
ALREADY OUT THERE.

01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:33.573
IT'S ALREADY WAY AHEAD OF US AND

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.575
WE'RE TRYING TO PULL IN AND

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:37.844
CREATE SOME RULES WHEN PEOPLE

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:38.912
ARE USED TO DOING THINGS.

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:42.015
THEIR WAY -- AND I THINK THERE'S

01:48:42.082 --> 01:48:45.018
WE'VE GOT A CONTINUE TO CHANGE

01:48:45.085 --> 01:48:47.387
THE CULTURE SO THAT WE ALL LEARN

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.923
AND REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.958
ONE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. ONE

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:53.760
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND RIGHT

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:56.129
NOW WE ARE BEHAVING.

01:48:56.196 --> 01:48:59.065
LIKE TO SCHOOL SYSTEMS.

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:00.934
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR KIDS

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:02.469
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE FISH AND

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:03.970
SEA OF OUR TAX DOLLARS.

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.505
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR HAVING

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:07.440
STANDARD THAT EVERYBODY COMPLIES

SUBJECT HERE AGAIN THIS MORNING --

02:48:06.109 --> 02:48:08.478
AS I READ THAT THE BILL AND AS I

02:48:08.545 --> 02:48:10.847
READ THE THE ANALYSIS.

02:48:10.914 --> 02:48:13.249
IT SEEMS THAT THE THE FOCUS THAT

02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:15.885
THE AUTHOR HAS HIS -- RESTORING

02:48:15.952 --> 02:48:17.620
THE RIGHT OF ANGEL TO INDIVIDUAL

02:48:17.687 --> 02:48:19.389
DISTRICTS TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OF

02:48:19.456 --> 02:48:20.657
THE SCHOOLS IS THE HAS THE

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:23.226
ESSENCE OF OF THE CONCERNS THAT

02:48:23.293 --> 02:48:23.827
ARE TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED IN

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:25.462
THIS BILL [inaudible]

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:28.298
AND SO IN SOME WAYS THAT THE THE

02:48:28.364 --> 02:48:30.300
THE THE CRITICISM IS A PROCESS

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:32.001
CRITICISM NOT A SUBSTANCE

02:48:32.068 --> 02:48:32.936
CRITICISM.

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.571
LIKE GIVE THE DEBATE HERE TODAY

02:48:34.637 --> 02:48:37.040
WAS ABOUT -- WHERE AN AUTHORIZED --

02:48:37.106 --> 02:48:38.508
HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT

02:48:38.575 --> 02:48:40.143
IN A SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE AND

02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:42.378
WE WERE EXAMINING THAT.

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:43.546
I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY OF THAT

02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:45.448
OF OUR TIME IN THAT EXAMINATION

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:46.716
BECAUSE HERE WE ARE.

02:48:46.783 --> 02:48:48.718
TRYING TO IDENTIFY A FAILURE AND

02:48:48.785 --> 02:48:49.619
WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO

02:48:49.686 --> 02:48:51.488
MAKE IT BETTER FOR THE STUDENTS

02:48:51.554 --> 02:48:52.789
IN THOSE FAMILIES.

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:54.591
OF THE BY PRODUCT OF THAT MAY BE

02:48:54.657 --> 02:48:55.825
WHAT'S BENEFIT OFFICIAL TO A

02:48:55.892 --> 02:48:57.393
SCHOOL DISTRICT OR NOT.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.596
BUT THE FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE ON

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.231
THE SCHOOL AND THE KIDS.

02:49:01.297 --> 02:49:02.298
AND THE PARENTS AND ALL THAT

02:49:02.365 --> 02:49:04.434
HAPPENS AND ALL THAT HAPPENS

02:49:04.501 --> 02:49:05.902
THERE.

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:07.003
BUT THE COULD BUT THE CRITICISM

02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:08.137
THAT'S TRYING TO BE OVERCOME

02:49:08.204 --> 02:49:09.772
WITH THIS BILL IS THE PROCESS

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:10.573
FOR HOW.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:14.944
THESE CHARTERS ARE AUTHORIZED --

02:49:15.011 --> 02:49:15.945
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHERE I HAVE

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:19.649
SOME SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE

02:49:19.716 --> 02:49:21.117
THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LINES

02:49:21.184 --> 02:49:22.785
ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFERENT

02:49:22.852 --> 02:49:24.454
EVERYWHERE I WAS LOOKING AT LOS

02:49:24.521 --> 02:49:27.156
ANGELES AND LOOKING AT JUST A

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:28.191
LITTLE MATH WITH.

02:49:28.258 --> 02:49:29.859
ALL THE CITIES IN DIFFERENT

02:49:29.926 --> 02:49:32.228
COLORS AND YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT

02:49:32.295 --> 02:49:34.797
THE CITY CITY LINES WE LOOK AT

02:49:34.864 --> 02:49:36.533
SENATORIAL LINES ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:49:36.599 --> 02:49:38.935
LINES IT'S AWFULLY ARBITRARY.

02:49:39.002 --> 02:49:40.203
I KNOW THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:41.704
THE LAW ARE THAT YOU CAN

02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:43.239
AUTHORIZE OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY

02:49:43.306 --> 02:49:44.741
SO LEASE WE HAVE SOME BOUNDARIES

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:46.142
THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW ARE PUT

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:48.444
IN PLACE YOU CAN AUTHORIZE

02:49:48.511 --> 02:49:49.712
OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY.

02:49:49.779 --> 02:49:51.247
BUT THEN IT IT GETS TO BE A

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:53.182
QUESTIONABLE.

02:49:53.249 --> 02:49:55.451
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY AT

02:49:55.518 --> 02:49:58.888
STAKE HERE IS IT THE IS IT --

02:49:58.955 --> 02:49:59.822
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE

02:49:59.889 --> 02:50:02.258
BLOCKING ANOTHER THAT ARE NEXT

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:02.892
TO EACH OTHER IN A LINE DIVIDES

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:04.193
THEM.

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:04.694
OR IS IT SOMETHING MORE

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:05.795
SUBSTANTIAL.

02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:07.764
IF IF THERE WAS CRITICISM THAT

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.399
WE WERE TRYING TO OVERCOME --

02:50:09.465 --> 02:50:11.034
WITH PAY TO PLAY AND HOW

02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:14.203
AUTHORIZATION IS DONE THAT HAS --

02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:17.640
CERTAINLY RESIDENTS WITH ME --

02:50:17.707 --> 02:50:19.008
AND IF THERE WAS IF THERE WAS

02:50:19.075 --> 02:50:20.810
FOCUS ON THIS OVERSIGHT AND HOW

02:50:20.877 --> 02:50:22.045
IT WAS POORLY DONE AND LET'S

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.913
FOCUS ON THAT AND TALK ABOUT HOW

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:24.981
WE CAN DO THAT BETTER.

02:50:25.048 --> 02:50:27.417
I I KNOWLEDGE THAT AUTHORIZING

02:50:27.483 --> 02:50:28.184
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

02:50:28.251 --> 02:50:29.586
AUTHORIZING IT IT'S IT'S VERY

02:50:29.652 --> 02:50:30.753
COMPLEX.

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.288
AND IT'S VERY COSTLY AND THERE

02:50:32.355 --> 02:50:33.523
ARE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT

02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:34.891
ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IT AND SOME

02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:36.426
THAT ARE NOT AND THAT DOES GET

02:50:36.492 --> 02:50:37.961
IN THE WAY OF THE ABILITY TO

02:50:38.027 --> 02:50:39.295
AUTHORIZE.

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:41.164
A BECAUSE OF THAT -- BUT WITH IT

02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:43.499
COMES DOWN TO THE ISSUE OF LINES.

02:50:43.566 --> 02:50:44.801
THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY IS A

02:50:44.867 --> 02:50:47.036
LITTLE BIT OF A STOPPER FOR ME.

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:49.238
IF WE THOUGHT THAT TAX EIGHTY ON

02:50:49.305 --> 02:50:50.440
THE TESTIMONY THAT'S BEEN

02:50:50.506 --> 02:50:52.308
PROVIDED TODAY AND AND THROUGH

02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:54.410
CORRESPONDENCE.

02:50:54.477 --> 02:50:54.944
THAT RAISES SOME IMPORTANT

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:56.012
QUESTIONS.

02:50:56.079 --> 02:50:57.447
THE ABILITY TO GET A CLASSROOM

02:50:57.513 --> 02:51:00.450
SPACE FOR A CHARTER IS NOT EASY.

02:51:00.516 --> 02:51:01.517
AND AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN

02:51:01.584 --> 02:51:02.752
THE OTHER IN THE EARLIER BILL

02:51:02.819 --> 02:51:04.988
THAT THERE'S SOME SELF INTEREST

02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:06.255
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT --

02:51:06.322 --> 02:51:08.758
AUTHORIZING A CHARTER BECAUSE

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:09.926
IT'S TAKEN AWAY THEIR MONEY.

02:51:09.993 --> 02:51:11.327
AND IT MADE ME TAKEN AWAY THEIR

02:51:11.394 --> 02:51:12.729
CLASSROOM SPACE.

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:14.197
AND SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT --

02:51:14.263 --> 02:51:15.999
WE COULD CREATE INHERENT

02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:16.532
CONFLICTS THAT ARE HARD TO

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:19.202
OVERCOME -- IF BUT I CHARTER

02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:20.570
WANTS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN A

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:21.704
COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL

02:51:21.771 --> 02:51:23.373
DISTRICTS OPPOSED TO IT AND THEY

02:51:23.439 --> 02:51:24.173
DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP IN A

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.441
CLASSROOM SPACE WHAT'S THAT

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:26.442
CHARTER SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:51:26.509 --> 02:51:28.111
WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO GO.

02:51:28.177 --> 02:51:29.946
AND NOW DOES A LINE SEPARATING

02:51:30.013 --> 02:51:31.681
ONE BLOCK FROM ANOTHER ONE CITY

02:51:31.748 --> 02:51:33.516
FROM ANOTHER ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:51:33.583 --> 02:51:35.718
FROM ANOTHER -- IS THAT'S GOING

02:51:35.785 --> 02:51:38.521
TO BE NOW UNDER THIS BILL THAT

02:51:38.588 --> 02:51:40.857
THAT CHARTER TO THRIVE AND FIND

02:51:40.923 --> 02:51:41.891
SPACE.

02:51:41.958 --> 02:51:43.326
AND WHAT ABOUT THE AT THE AT THE

02:51:43.393 --> 02:51:44.594
LOCATION NEXT TO TRANSIT LINES.

02:51:44.661 --> 02:51:46.729
WERE MAKE IT EASIER FOR KIDS TO

02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:47.697
GET TO SCHOOL.

02:51:47.764 --> 02:51:49.432
NOW THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING

02:51:49.499 --> 02:51:50.066
TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

02:51:50.133 --> 02:51:51.000
LINE.

02:51:51.067 --> 02:51:52.168
AND SOME CASES NOT EVEN -- I

02:51:52.235 --> 02:51:54.337
CITY LINE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:51:54.404 --> 02:51:55.838
TRANSIT LINE.

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:57.507
A BUS OR TRAIN AND THAT'S A

02:51:57.573 --> 02:51:58.474
PRETTY GOOD REASON TO TRY TO

02:51:58.541 --> 02:52:00.276
FIND A LOCATION FOR SCHOOL

02:52:00.343 --> 02:52:00.943
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO TRY TO MAKE

02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:01.678
IT.

02:52:01.744 --> 02:52:03.513
EASIER FOR KIDS.

02:52:03.579 --> 02:52:04.814
SO I DO FIND THAT THAT THEY'LL

02:52:04.881 --> 02:52:06.482
THE ISSUE OF LINES IS SOMEWHAT

02:52:06.549 --> 02:52:08.051
ARBITRARY.

02:52:08.117 --> 02:52:09.552
AND I THINK IT IT IT FOR ME AT

02:52:09.619 --> 02:52:10.787
LEAST IT.

02:52:10.853 --> 02:52:12.422
IT DIVERTS FROM A FOCUS ON WHAT

02:52:12.488 --> 02:52:14.057
SHOULD BE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE

02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:15.825
WORK THAT WE DO AND THAT'S THAT

02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:17.360
THE QUALITY.

02:52:17.427 --> 02:52:19.696
OF THE INSTRUCTION -- THE THAT

02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:21.297
THE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT THAT IS

02:52:21.364 --> 02:52:23.466
OCCURRING OR NOT OCCURRING IN A

02:52:23.533 --> 02:52:25.334
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:52:25.401 --> 02:52:26.602
HI AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:52:26.669 --> 02:52:28.104
BROADER PROBLEM OF EDUCATION IN

02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:29.472
OUR STATE.

02:52:29.539 --> 02:52:31.374
AND YOU SAY WE'VE GOT SEVEN

02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:32.475
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE FOR

02:52:32.542 --> 02:52:34.110
PERFORMING SCHOOLS.

02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:35.411
OF WHICH THIS BILL WILL DO

02:52:35.478 --> 02:52:39.015
NOTHING TO CHANGE.

02:52:39.082 --> 02:52:41.350
THEN I START THINK WELL IS OUR

02:52:41.417 --> 02:52:42.752
FOCUS REALLY IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:45.555
IS IT ON IS IT ABOUT LINES OR IS

02:52:45.621 --> 02:52:48.691
IT ABOUT -- STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT.

02:52:48.758 --> 02:52:50.093
AND THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TROUBLE

02:52:50.159 --> 02:52:50.727
UNFORTUNATELY WITH YOUR BILL

02:52:50.793 --> 02:52:52.562
TODAY IT'S AS I WANT TO FOCUS ON

02:52:52.628 --> 02:52:53.629
STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OR LACK

02:52:53.696 --> 02:52:55.298
THEREOF.

02:52:55.364 --> 02:52:58.367
AND NOT ON LINES -- THE LAW

02:52:58.434 --> 02:52:59.936
ITSELF TODAY SAYS IT HAS TO BE

02:53:00.002 --> 02:53:01.270
WITHIN A COUNTY OKAY THERE ARE

02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:02.505
SOME BOUNDARIES.

02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:04.173
IF WE HAVE ABUSE THAN WE SHOULD

02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.575
FOCUS ON THAT ABUSE AND THE

02:53:05.641 --> 02:53:07.343
COMPLEXITY OF CHARTERING IS

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:09.011
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW --

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:10.446
TOGETHER HAS TO AND PAID SOME

02:53:10.513 --> 02:53:11.814
ATTENTION TO I THINK WE PAY SOME

02:53:11.881 --> 02:53:13.583
ATTENTION TO AND THAT'S A GOOD

02:53:13.649 --> 02:53:15.118
THAT'S A GOOD FOCUS.

02:53:15.184 --> 02:53:16.886
BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME ARE THE

02:53:16.953 --> 02:53:18.554
FOCUS JUST PURELY ON LINE SECOND

02:53:18.621 --> 02:53:20.389
THIS IS THE THE AT THE TENSION

02:53:20.456 --> 02:53:22.325
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE PAYING.

02:53:22.391 --> 02:53:23.960
TO UNDERPERFORMING SCHOOLS AND

02:53:24.026 --> 02:53:26.028
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T BE SUPPORT OF

02:53:26.095 --> 02:53:27.497
THE BILL TODAY.

02:53:27.563 --> 02:53:28.664
BECAUSE CENTER GLAZER ANY OTHER

02:53:40.209 --> 02:53:41.344
A SIMPLE.

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:44.881
ISSUE THAT UNFORTUNATELY -- HAS

02:53:44.947 --> 02:53:48.451
BECOME TOO COMPLICATED -- THE

02:53:48.518 --> 02:53:50.153
OTHER LINES THESE LINES IN YOUR

PASADENA AND THERE WOULD BE NO

02:56:13.829 --> 02:56:14.964
PLACE FOR US TO GO THERE THAT'S

02:56:15.031 --> 02:56:17.099
A DISTRICT OF FIVE THOUSAND

02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:17.366
STUDENTS.

02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:19.402
AND HE WAS THE AS A DISTRICT OF

02:56:19.468 --> 02:56:20.369
SEVENTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS SO

02:56:20.436 --> 02:56:21.904

CHARTER SCHOOL AND ONLY AFTER

02:57:09.018 --> 02:57:11.020
THEY ARE AT CAPACITY IS A MOMENT

02:57:11.087 --> 02:57:12.588
DETERMINED BY PUBLIC RANDOM

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:13.255
DRAWING.

02:57:13.322 --> 02:57:14.790
NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER

02:57:14.857 --> 02:57:16.525
SCHOOLS ARE LIMITED TO SERVING

02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:18.127

COUNTY AND ADJACENT COUNTY SO

02:57:20.029 --> 02:57:21.364
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT NON

CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS

02:57:22.798 --> 02:57:24.467
POTENTIALLY HAVE STUDENTS COMING.

02:57:24.533 --> 02:57:25.701
FROM WITHIN THEIR COUNTY AND

02:57:25.768 --> 02:57:27.336
ADJACENT COUNTIES AND THE

02:57:27.403 --> 02:57:29.071
CHARTER SCHOOL LAW SAYS YOU MUST

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:31.240

02:57:31.307 --> 02:57:32.141
ATTEND.

02:57:32.208 --> 02:57:32.775
WHAT THAT MANS IS THAT WE NEED

CODE -- FIVE ONE SEVEN FOUR SIX

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:39.415
SAYS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE THE

02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:40.616
SAME RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD

02:57:40.683 --> 02:57:42.451
GET IT OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND

02:57:42.518 --> 02:57:43.552
THAT WOULD INCLUDE LEARNING

02:57:43.619 --> 02:57:44.920
CENTERS -- LEARNING CENTERS

02:57:44.987 --> 02:57:46.322

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:48.057
PROVIDE TESTING TO DURING

02:57:48.124 --> 02:57:49.959
SPECIAL EDUCATION SUPPORTS ITS

02:57:50.026 --> 02:57:51.961
ULTRA HOT THAT'S ALSO THE THAT'S

02:57:52.028 --> 02:57:53.929
ALSO THE PLACE WHERE WE ALLOW

02:57:53.996 --> 02:57:55.297

SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AS

02:57:59.468 --> 02:58:02.671
WELL AS SO IF WE LIMIT -- IF WE

02:58:02.738 --> 02:58:04.040
LIMIT THE RESOURCE CENTERS --

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:06.042
JUST TO THE LOCAL SCHOOL

02:58:06.108 --> 02:58:07.076
DISTRICT WHERE THE CHARTER

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:08.944

STUDENTS WHERE THEY LIVE.

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:12.648
SO IF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

02:58:12.715 --> 02:58:15.384
PREDOMINANTLY -- IS LOCATED --

02:58:15.451 --> 02:58:17.086
LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:58:17.153 --> 02:58:19.455
SAN DIEGO IN SAN DIEGO UNIFIED

02:58:19.522 --> 02:58:21.590
BOUNDARIES -- THAT IS A LARGE

02:58:21.657 --> 02:58:23.492
VERY LARGE COUNTY -- IF WE ONLY

02:58:23.559 --> 02:58:25.428
LIMIT OUR FACILITIES TO TO THAT

02:58:25.494 --> 02:58:27.730
DISTRICT -- AND WE ARE AND LET'S

02:58:27.797 --> 02:58:29.665
SAY WE'VE GOT FIVE TO TEN KIDDOS

02:58:29.732 --> 02:58:31.367
THAT ARE AN ORANGE COUNTY --

02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:32.468
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REQUIRE

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:33.803
THEM TO TRAVEL ALL THE WAY DOWN

02:58:33.869 --> 02:58:36.072
TO SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IN ORDER TO

02:58:36.138 --> 02:58:37.173
PROVIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:58:37.239 --> 02:58:38.240
SERVICES AND ASSESSMENTS.

02:58:38.307 --> 02:58:39.308
I MEAN EVEN ARGUABLY

02:58:39.375 --> 02:58:41.277
STANDARDIZED TESTING -- WHICH IS

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:43.813
REQUIRED BY LAW -- BECAUSE THE

02:58:43.879 --> 02:58:45.714
LAW IS SO BROAD TO TOES TO LIMIT

02:58:45.781 --> 02:58:47.183
US TO HAVE NOT HAVING RESOURCE

02:58:47.249 --> 02:58:49.585
CENTERS MEETING SPACES OR ANY

02:58:49.652 --> 02:58:50.586
OTHER SATELLITE FACILITY.

02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:52.621
OF RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE THE LAW

02:58:52.688 --> 02:58:55.691
IS LIMITING ENOUGH IT SAYS THAT

02:58:55.758 --> 02:58:57.026
WE CAN ONLY HAVE A FACILITY.

02:58:57.093 --> 02:58:58.861
AND AN ADJACENT COUNTY IF WE ARE

02:58:58.928 --> 02:59:00.863
PRIMARY EDUCATIONAL SERVICES ARE

02:59:00.930 --> 02:59:02.898
WITHIN -- WITHIN THE COUNTY IN

02:59:02.965 --> 02:59:04.400
WHICH WERE AUTHORIZED AND THE

02:59:04.467 --> 02:59:05.668
MAJORITY OF SERVE AS STUDENTS

02:59:05.734 --> 02:59:07.736
THAT WE SERVE ARE RESIDING

02:59:07.803 --> 02:59:09.572
WITHIN THE AUTHORIZING COUNTY I

02:59:09.638 --> 02:59:14.844
THINK THESE LIMITS ARE ENOUGH

02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:17.146
AND I I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE.

02:59:17.213 --> 02:59:17.913
RIGHT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE

02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:19.181
ANSWER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

02:59:19.248 --> 02:59:20.783
THANK YOU SENATOR WILK.

02:59:20.850 --> 02:59:21.417
ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO

02:59:21.484 --> 02:59:21.984
CLOSE CERTAINLY THANK YOU I

02:59:22.051 --> 02:59:22.618
WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO ADDRESS

02:59:22.685 --> 02:59:23.686
AT SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED

02:59:23.752 --> 02:59:24.787
BY MY SENATE COLLEAGUES HERE.

02:59:24.854 --> 02:59:28.324
TODAY AND AND BY THE OPPOSITION --

02:59:28.390 --> 02:59:29.158
PART OF THE REASON IT'S SO

02:59:29.225 --> 02:59:31.193
CRITICAL THAT WE GET THE COUNTY

02:59:31.260 --> 02:59:34.029
AUTHORIZATION PROCESS RIGHT IN

02:59:34.096 --> 02:59:34.630
FIFTEEN OH FIVE IS BECAUSE IT

02:59:34.697 --> 02:59:35.531
ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE ISSUES

02:59:35.598 --> 02:59:38.200
THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS RAISED --

02:59:38.267 --> 02:59:40.569
THERE ARE MEANINGFUL REASONS FOR

02:59:40.636 --> 02:59:42.371
COUNTY AUTHORIZED CHARTERS TO

02:59:42.438 --> 02:59:43.139
EXIST SOME OF THOSE REYES BY

02:59:43.205 --> 02:59:45.174
SENATOR GLAZER WERE SOMETIMES

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:47.309
LINES ARE SIMPLY ARBITRARY AND

02:59:47.376 --> 02:59:48.477
THE ABILITY TO FIND A FACILITY

02:59:48.544 --> 02:59:50.479
DOESN'T FIT LEARN ARBITRARY LINE

02:59:50.546 --> 02:59:51.247
HAS BEEN DRAWN.

02:59:51.313 --> 02:59:52.414
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AT

02:59:52.481 --> 02:59:53.249
THAT BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE

02:59:53.315 --> 02:59:55.551
FORWARD AND WE REALLY REALLY

02:59:55.618 --> 02:59:55.885
REFINED NOT.

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:57.686
BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

02:59:57.753 --> 03:00:00.022
EQUATION WE HAVE GOT IN THIS

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:01.757
WHOLE CONVERSATION TO STOP

03:00:01.824 --> 03:00:03.692
LETTING THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:04.960
OF THE GOOD.

03:00:05.027 --> 03:00:06.829
AND THE RIGHT AND THE ETHICAL WE

03:00:06.896 --> 03:00:08.564
ARE AT A CROSSROADS IN NEEDING

03:00:08.631 --> 03:00:11.767
TO REFINE AND DEFINE HOW CHARTER

03:00:11.834 --> 03:00:13.669
SCHOOLS OPERATE IN TANDEM AND IN

03:00:13.736 --> 03:00:15.771
COOPERATION WITH THE DISTRICTS

03:00:15.838 --> 03:00:17.439
WHERE THEY ARE SERVING STUDENTS.

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:18.774
AND IF WE DON'T ESTABLISH A

03:00:18.841 --> 03:00:21.610
SYSTEM WHERE THE RIGHT POINT OF

03:00:21.677 --> 03:00:24.246
INTERACTION FOUR CHAIR CHARTER

03:00:24.313 --> 03:00:26.015
PARENTS AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION

03:00:26.081 --> 03:00:27.349
TEAMS IS THE LOCAL SCHOOL

03:00:27.416 --> 03:00:28.684
DISTRICT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

03:00:28.751 --> 03:00:29.752
HAVE THESE BINARY.

03:00:29.818 --> 03:00:31.387
AN OPPOSITIONAL CONVERSATIONS

03:00:31.453 --> 03:00:33.088
AND NOT COME TO THE TABLE AS

03:00:33.155 --> 03:00:34.356
COMMUNITIES.

03:00:34.423 --> 03:00:35.791
AND AS AN INSTITUTION WE HAVE

03:00:35.858 --> 03:00:37.593
GOT TO BE CRITICALLY CAREFUL OF

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:39.562
WAITING INTO A SPACE OF CHECKING

03:00:39.628 --> 03:00:40.896
THE JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:42.364
OF DULY ELECTED LOCAL

03:00:42.431 --> 03:00:44.099
GOVERNMENTS AND THAT IS EXACTLY

03:00:44.166 --> 03:00:45.701
WHAT SCHOOL BOARDS ARE.

03:00:45.768 --> 03:00:47.570
I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT

03:00:47.636 --> 03:00:49.271
A CITY GOVERNMENT IS A DULY

03:00:49.338 --> 03:00:50.806
ELECTED MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.

03:00:50.873 --> 03:00:53.175
AND IF THE CITY ABOUT GROVER TO

03:00:53.242 --> 03:00:54.476
SAY TO THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WE

03:00:54.543 --> 03:00:56.312
NEED MORE POLICING WE THINK WE

03:00:56.378 --> 03:00:58.347
DO COMMUNITY COMMUNITY POLICING

03:00:58.414 --> 03:00:59.515
WITH A BETTER MODEL.

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.350
AND INCIDENTALLY WE DON'T HAVE

03:01:01.417 --> 03:01:02.918
ENOUGH SPACE TO LOCATE A NEW

03:01:02.985 --> 03:01:05.120
POLICE FACILITY WITHIN OUR CITY

03:01:05.187 --> 03:01:05.988
BOUNDARIES.

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:07.656
SO WE'RE GONNA LOCATED A FEW

03:01:07.723 --> 03:01:09.525
BLOCKS AWAY IN SACRAMENTO I KNOW

03:01:09.592 --> 03:01:10.960
BY THE WAY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:01:11.026 --> 03:01:15.297
OFFICERS WILL BE POLICING YOUR

03:01:15.364 --> 03:01:16.632
STREETS.

03:01:16.699 --> 03:01:17.266
AS A STATE LEGISLATURE WOULD WE

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:18.667
ALLOW THAT MUNICIPAL GOVERNANCE

03:01:18.734 --> 03:01:19.068
OVERREACH.

03:01:19.134 --> 03:01:19.702
I THINK NOT.

03:01:19.768 --> 03:01:21.003
AND I THINK IT'S TIME TO COME TO

03:01:21.070 --> 03:01:22.838
TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT A

03:01:22.905 --> 03:01:24.840
LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD HAS

03:01:24.907 --> 03:01:26.875
JURISDICTIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IT

03:01:26.942 --> 03:01:29.078
ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE PLACE OF

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:31.146
GOVERNANCE WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO

03:01:31.213 --> 03:01:32.548
ALLOW CHARTERS TO START TO

03:01:32.615 --> 03:01:34.216
ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

03:01:34.283 --> 03:01:35.884
THIS IS ONE STEP TOWARD DOING

03:01:35.951 --> 03:01:36.452
THAT.

03:01:36.518 --> 03:01:38.087
THERE WAS MAJORITY CONSENSUS ON

03:01:38.153 --> 03:01:39.488
THE TASK FORCE THAT THIS IS ONE

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:42.191
AREA WE NEED TO IMPROVE WE HAVE

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:43.659
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO PROVIDE

03:01:43.726 --> 03:01:45.060
AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY FOR

03:01:45.127 --> 03:01:45.961
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE THAN A

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:47.896
DECADE LONG PROBLEM.

03:01:47.963 --> 03:01:49.064
WHEN I SAW THEM AND SERVED ON

03:01:49.131 --> 03:01:49.999
THE NEW HOME SCHOOL BOARD WE

03:01:50.065 --> 03:01:51.200
STARTED DEALING WITH THIS THE

03:01:51.267 --> 03:01:54.303
YEAR I WAS ELECTED SO NINE YEARS?

03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:55.871
I HAVE WATCHED THIS AND WHILE

CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM AND

03:02:03.078 --> 03:02:04.847
FIND OPTIONS FOR THEM.

03:02:04.913 --> 03:02:05.748
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RECENT

03:02:05.814 --> 03:02:07.149
HEADLINES TIME AND AGAIN WE'VE

03:02:07.216 --> 03:02:09.551

DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER FUNDS WHICH

SAID TALKS ABOUT YOUR BILL IN

03:15:25.213 --> 03:15:27.015
GREAT DETAIL IN TERMS OF THE

03:15:27.082 --> 03:15:28.783
PROCESS THAT THE OF COMMITTEES

03:15:28.850 --> 03:15:30.718
BOTH HOUSES OF CRIED TO SET UP

03:15:30.785 --> 03:15:31.286
IN REGARD TO THESE TYPES OF

03:15:31.352 --> 03:15:33.955
THINGS -- AND BUT ALSO IN THE

03:15:34.022 --> 03:15:35.223
ANALYSIS THAT GOES THROUGH THE

03:15:35.290 --> 03:15:37.192
PROCESS THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL

03:15:37.258 --> 03:15:37.759
QUALITY COMMISSION IS GOING

03:15:37.826 --> 03:15:40.929
THROUGH. TO TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON

03:15:40.995 --> 03:15:44.232
SENATOR WINS BILL FROM.

03:15:44.299 --> 03:15:44.833
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND SO I

03:15:44.899 --> 03:15:45.967
WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE

03:15:46.034 --> 03:15:47.168
OPPORTUNITY TO SELL YOUR

03:15:47.235 --> 03:15:48.703
SUPPORTERS TO COMMENT ON THAT.

03:15:48.770 --> 03:15:50.638
SO A FEW LOOK ON PAGE THREE IT

03:15:50.705 --> 03:15:53.007
IT IT LAYS DOWN BY DATE THAT --

03:15:53.074 --> 03:15:54.843
HOW THEY'RE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON

03:15:54.909 --> 03:15:56.811
THAT REQUIREMENT AND -- THEY

03:15:56.878 --> 03:15:58.480
WERE AT A PERIOD OF TIME IT

03:15:58.546 --> 03:15:59.380
APPEARS WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED

03:15:59.447 --> 03:16:02.183
TO OF PRESENTED DRAFT CURRICULUM.

03:16:02.250 --> 03:16:03.651
FOR PUBLIC REVIEW IS SET OUT IN

03:16:03.718 --> 03:16:05.019
IS THAT BEEN -- AVAILABLE FOR

03:16:05.086 --> 03:16:07.188
YOU TO SEE NO IT'S NOT OUT YET

03:16:07.255 --> 03:16:08.089
OKAY.

03:16:08.156 --> 03:16:10.258
SO I GUESS ONE OF THE THE

03:16:10.325 --> 03:16:11.326
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS THAT.

03:16:11.392 --> 03:16:13.695
THEY COULD VERY WELL IN INCLUDE

03:16:13.761 --> 03:16:16.064
LAOTIAN HISTORY IN THAT REVIEW --

03:16:16.131 --> 03:16:17.699
IN THAT CORRECT THAT DRAFT

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:18.633
CURRICULUM.

03:16:18.700 --> 03:16:20.568
AND SO IT RAISES A QUESTION AT

03:16:20.635 --> 03:16:22.070
AND THE ANALYSIS RAISES THIS

03:16:22.137 --> 03:16:23.404
QUESTION IS THAT SHOULD WE ALLOW

03:16:23.471 --> 03:16:26.007
THAT PROCESS TO RUN ITS COURSE

03:16:26.074 --> 03:16:27.342
AND SEE WHETHER AN INJUSTICE OR

03:16:27.408 --> 03:16:29.110
AND AN OVERSIGHT IS IS YOU

03:16:29.177 --> 03:16:30.545
DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF THE NEED

03:16:30.612 --> 03:16:31.579
FOR THE BILL.

03:16:31.646 --> 03:16:32.614
REALLY IS PRESENT THAT THEY

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:34.582
COULD VERY WELL INCLUDED ALL THE

03:16:34.649 --> 03:16:39.687
THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO INCLUDE.

03:16:39.754 --> 03:16:40.421
IN THAT DRAFT CURRICULUM THAT

03:16:40.488 --> 03:16:41.623
WITH THAT IS THAT A FAIR

03:16:41.689 --> 03:16:42.290
OBSERVATION THEY COULD.

03:16:42.357 --> 03:16:43.224
AND THEY COULD NOT [inaudible]

03:16:43.291 --> 03:16:44.859
NOT [inaudible]

03:16:44.926 --> 03:16:46.794
OF ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF

03:16:46.861 --> 03:16:49.264
COURSE IS -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE

03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:50.899
THAT IT IS INCLUDED IN IN A

03:16:50.965 --> 03:16:51.799
PRESS IN A IN A IN A JUDICIOUS

03:16:51.866 --> 03:16:53.601
MAN AN APPROPRIATE TIME RATHER

03:16:53.668 --> 03:16:55.136
THAN WAITING TO SEE IF THERE'S

03:16:55.203 --> 03:16:56.538
GONNA BE A FALL OUT AND IT

03:16:56.604 --> 03:16:58.406
DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN WE COME BACK.

03:16:58.473 --> 03:16:59.674
IT WAS CLEAR THAT WAS NOT AT IT

03:16:59.741 --> 03:17:01.776
OKAY AND IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT FOR

03:17:01.843 --> 03:17:03.011
EVERYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED

03:17:03.077 --> 03:17:04.112
BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS SOME

03:17:04.179 --> 03:17:06.314
OTHER OVERSIGHTS IN PEOPLE THAT

03:17:06.381 --> 03:17:06.714
IN.

03:17:06.781 --> 03:17:09.150
AND 

03:17:09.217 --> 03:17:11.853
OF THE OF THE LAW COMMUNITY.

03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:13.621
THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE AS THEIR

03:17:13.688 --> 03:17:15.356
CONCERN IS THAT THEY ARE QUIET

03:17:15.423 --> 03:17:16.991
GROUP OF PEOPLE OFTENTIMES NOT

03:17:17.058 --> 03:17:18.259
INVOLVED IN THE POLITICAL

03:17:18.326 --> 03:17:19.727
PROCESS WHEN THEY CAME TO ME.

03:17:19.794 --> 03:17:21.062
AND THE FACT THAT THEY WANTED TO

03:17:21.129 --> 03:17:22.730
BE INCLUDED IN A DISCOVERED THAT

03:17:22.797 --> 03:17:24.165
EVERYBODY ELSE WAS NAMED EXCEPT

03:17:24.232 --> 03:17:25.099
FOR THEM.

03:17:25.166 --> 03:17:27.569
AND AND SO WE LOOKED AT VARIOUS

03:17:27.635 --> 03:17:28.736
WAYS OF HOW WE CAN APPROACH IT

03:17:28.803 --> 03:17:30.605
WHETHER WE WOULD JUST GO AND TRY

03:17:30.672 --> 03:17:31.706
TO DO IT IN A BACK WAY OR

03:17:31.773 --> 03:17:34.742
WHATEVER AND WE SAID NO.

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:35.376
THEY NEEDED TO HAVE THEIR STORY

03:17:35.443 --> 03:17:36.878
TOLD.

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:37.478
THEY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE

03:17:37.545 --> 03:17:38.079
FISH A RECORD THEY NEED TO BE

03:17:38.146 --> 03:17:39.347
INCLUDED BY THIS HOUSE SO THAT

03:17:39.414 --> 03:17:40.748
WE WOULD ALWAYS RECOGNIZEWHO

03:17:40.815 --> 03:17:41.549
THEY ARE.

03:17:41.616 --> 03:17:43.218
AND IF THERE'S MORE THAN JUST

03:17:43.284 --> 03:17:44.319
ONE GROUP OR TWO GROUPS THAT WE

03:17:44.385 --> 03:17:45.386
TALKED.

03:17:45.453 --> 03:17:47.722
TO AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND --

03:17:47.789 --> 03:17:49.090
WE DECIDED TO DO THE BILL --

03:17:49.157 --> 03:17:50.525
KNOWING THAT THIS PROCESS WAS

03:17:50.592 --> 03:17:52.126
OCCURRING BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

03:17:52.193 --> 03:17:53.995
SURE THAT THOSE WERE INVOLVED IN

03:17:54.062 --> 03:17:54.629
THE IN THE IN THE COMEDIAN I'M

03:17:54.696 --> 03:17:56.497
ON THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY

03:17:56.564 --> 03:17:58.466
COMMITTEE NOW -- BUT WE KNOW

03:17:58.533 --> 03:17:59.701
THAT IT'S THERE WE'VE BEEN ASKED

03:17:59.767 --> 03:18:00.969
TO DO IT IN A TIMELY MANNER TO

03:18:01.035 --> 03:18:02.737
HAVE IT INCLUDED WITHOUT WAITING

03:18:02.804 --> 03:18:05.073
FOR SOMETHING TO GO WRONG AND

03:18:05.139 --> 03:18:07.408
THEN CORRECT -- DOESN'T COST US

03:18:07.475 --> 03:18:08.209
ANYTHING TO CORRECTED IN THE

03:18:08.276 --> 03:18:09.744
BEGINNING TO DO THE INCLUSION

03:18:09.811 --> 03:18:11.379
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY.

03:18:11.446 --> 03:18:13.548
VERY GOOD AND I I I I CERTAINLY

03:18:13.615 --> 03:18:15.350
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE THE BEST

03:18:15.416 --> 03:18:16.751
OF INTENTIONS AND WHICH YOU'VE

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:18.419
ADVANCE THIS BILL.

03:18:18.486 --> 03:18:19.621
THAT THE THE COMMITTEE --

ABOUT HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM AND

04:19:01.559 --> 04:19:02.460
THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING TO THEM.

04:19:02.526 --> 04:19:03.527
GONNA TAKE AWAY THAT

04:19:03.594 --> 04:19:05.062
RESPONSIBILITY.

04:19:05.129 --> 04:19:05.963
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA DICTATE HOW

04:19:07.899 --> 04:19:09.934
HAVE A PROBLEM ON THAT LEVEL.

04:19:10.001 --> 04:19:10.968
BUT THE THE OTHER LEVEL THAT I

04:19:11.035 --> 04:19:12.403
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS THAT IT

04:19:12.470 --> 04:19:13.304
SEEMS LIKE.

04:19:13.371 --> 04:19:14.605

GOING TO INCREASE TUITION SO

04:19:26.617 --> 04:19:27.985
THAT THEY CAN GET A RAISE.

04:19:28.052 --> 04:19:29.754
IS THAT THE PERVERSE INCENTIVES

04:19:29.820 --> 04:19:30.988
CREATED IN THIS BILL.

04:19:31.055 --> 04:19:32.523
BECAUSE OF ITS ALL ABOUT THEM

04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:34.992
THAT'S REALLY THE PREMISE.

04:19:35.059 --> 04:19:36.060
THAT MEANS THEY'RE GONNA NOT DO

04:19:36.127 --> 04:19:37.895
WHAT'S NECESSARY TO PROTECT AND

04:19:37.962 --> 04:19:39.196

BILL.

04:19:47.204 --> 04:19:49.840
IT SEEMS TO ME AS SOMEONE WHO

04:19:49.907 --> 04:19:51.275
DOESN'T LIKE TO WISH INCREASES.

04:19:51.342 --> 04:19:52.576
AND DOESN'T LIKE TO PAY OUR

04:19:52.643 --> 04:19:55.112
PRESIDENTS A LOT OF MONEY FOR

04:19:55.179 --> 04:19:56.113
CERTAINLY.

04:19:56.180 --> 04:19:57.648
HAS THAT AS A LOT OF TIMES IT'S

04:19:57.715 --> 04:19:59.984
PROPOSE.

04:20:00.051 --> 04:20:00.584
AND AND THAT'S THE DILEMMA FOR

04:20:00.651 --> 04:20:02.119
SOMEONE [inaudible]

04:20:02.186 --> 04:20:04.288
LIKE ME.

04:20:04.355 --> 04:20:05.489
YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT.

04:20:05.556 --> 04:20:06.924
THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER YES WE

04:20:06.991 --> 04:20:08.659
RESPOND TO THAT -- YOU KNOW AND

04:20:08.726 --> 04:20:09.327
I APPRECIATE.

04:20:09.393 --> 04:20:10.861
YOU SENATOR GLAZER WHEN YOU ARE

04:20:10.928 --> 04:20:12.430
ON THE BOARD SHOWING RESTRAINT

04:20:12.496 --> 04:20:14.365
REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

04:20:14.432 --> 04:20:16.100
I THINK THE HISTORY ON THE BOARD

04:20:16.167 --> 04:20:17.335
OF TRUSTEES HAS SHOWN THAT VERY

04:20:17.401 --> 04:20:18.636
FEW TRUSTEES.

04:20:18.703 --> 04:20:20.504
HAVE SHOWN RESTRAINT IN

04:20:20.571 --> 04:20:22.506
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SIMILARLY

04:20:22.573 --> 04:20:23.975
THE BORDER THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

04:20:24.041 --> 04:20:25.843
HAS NOT SHOWN RESTRAINT WHEN IT

04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:28.446
COMES TO INCREASING STUDENT FEES

04:20:28.512 --> 04:20:30.614
ALMOST ALL OF THE HOLES ON THE

04:20:30.681 --> 04:20:32.249
INCREASE IN STUDENT FEES HAVE

04:20:32.316 --> 04:20:33.985
BEEN FROM THE EXECUTIVE FROM

04:20:34.051 --> 04:20:35.786
FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN.

04:20:35.853 --> 04:20:37.655
AND NOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME WHO

04:20:37.722 --> 04:20:39.623
MADE SURE THAT STUDENT FEES WERE.

04:20:39.690 --> 04:20:41.659
NOT AND NOT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE

04:20:41.726 --> 04:20:44.061
IN THE CURRENT BUDGET -- AND

04:20:44.128 --> 04:20:45.830
WE'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT

04:20:45.896 --> 04:20:50.034
LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THE RECENT

04:20:50.101 --> 04:20:53.771
AUDIT WELL ON THE I STARTED

04:20:53.838 --> 04:20:56.207
TEACHING AT BAY IN NINETEEN

04:20:56.273 --> 04:20:57.441
NINETY NINE SO I GUESS THIS IS

04:20:57.508 --> 04:20:58.075
MY TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY.

04:20:58.142 --> 04:20:58.709
AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I

04:20:58.776 --> 04:20:59.977
FIRST STARTED TEACHING WE DID

04:21:00.044 --> 04:21:01.946
NOT HAVE FOOD PANTRIES ON EVERY

04:21:02.013 --> 04:21:03.948
CAMPUS AND WE DO NOW AND WE

04:21:04.015 --> 04:21:06.350
DON'T NEED WE DID NOT HAVE ANY.

04:21:06.417 --> 04:21:07.852
NO ONE WAS TALKING ABOUT LEADING

04:21:07.918 --> 04:21:09.520
STUDENTS SLEEP IN THEIR CARS

04:21:09.587 --> 04:21:10.755
BECAUSE THEY WERE HOMELESS.

04:21:10.821 --> 04:21:13.290
THE EFFECTS OF THE CHOICES OF

04:21:13.357 --> 04:21:14.592
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAVE.

04:21:14.658 --> 04:21:16.093
HI HELD UP OVER THE YEARS AND

04:21:16.160 --> 04:21:18.062
LET US TO WHERE WE ARE AND WE

04:21:18.129 --> 04:21:20.164
FEEL AS AT THAT THE CSU NEEDS

04:21:20.231 --> 04:21:21.532
MORE OVERSIGHT.

04:21:21.599 --> 04:21:23.667
THEY HAVE BEEN WITHHOLDING THOSE

04:21:23.734 --> 04:21:25.736
STUDENT FEES PROP FROM PROVIDING

04:21:25.803 --> 04:21:27.238
REAL STUDENT SERVICES.

04:21:27.304 --> 04:21:28.706
AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD

04:21:28.773 --> 04:21:30.541
STEWARDS OF THE SYSTEM THE CSU

04:21:30.608 --> 04:21:32.777
ISN'T STATUTE AND WE FEEL THAT

04:21:32.843 --> 04:21:33.844
DAY IT IS TIME.

04:21:33.911 --> 04:21:35.513
FOR THEM TO BE UNDER THAT

04:21:35.579 --> 04:21:37.114
CONSTRAINT.

04:21:37.181 --> 04:21:38.416
VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH

04:21:38.482 --> 04:21:39.850
CENTER GLAZER IS AT ALL DO YOU

04:21:39.917 --> 04:21:41.419
REALLY QUESTIONS.

04:21:41.485 --> 04:21:42.820
WELL I I THINK THERE WAS NOBODY

04:21:42.887 --> 04:21:44.055
ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

04:21:44.121 --> 04:21:46.457
PERVERSE INCENTIVES SECURE.

04:21:46.524 --> 04:21:47.224
REYES SALARIES AND A YEAR IN

04:21:47.291 --> 04:21:48.292
WHICH YOU HAVE.

04:21:48.359 --> 04:21:49.493
A TUITION INCREASE THEN DO YOU

04:21:49.560 --> 04:21:50.761
PUT THE PRESSURE IN THE WRONG

04:21:50.828 --> 04:21:51.762
PLACE BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE NOT

04:21:51.829 --> 04:21:53.397
GONNA I KNOW NO ONE LIKES TO

04:21:53.464 --> 04:21:54.932
RAISE TUITION RIGHT BUT IT'S ALL.

04:21:54.999 --> 04:21:56.634
IT'S ALL ON US IT'S ABOUT HOW WE

04:21:56.700 --> 04:21:58.702
COMPENSATE HOW WE HOW WE PUT IN

04:21:58.769 --> 04:22:02.039
THE BUDGET EACH YEAR. TO PROVIDE

04:22:02.106 --> 04:22:02.706
FOR WHAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO RUN

04:22:02.773 --> 04:22:04.508
AND WE'VE BEEN IN A COUPLE GOOD

04:22:04.575 --> 04:22:05.109
YEARS BUT THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS

04:22:05.176 --> 04:22:06.110
GOOD YEARS.

04:22:06.177 --> 04:22:07.511
AND SO IT'S A VERY TOUGH CHOICE

04:22:07.578 --> 04:22:09.080
FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE

04:22:09.146 --> 04:22:10.414
CERTAINLY FOR THE TRUSTEES AND

04:22:10.481 --> 04:22:11.415
SO DO YOU CREATE A WAY A

04:22:11.482 --> 04:22:12.850
PERVERSE INCENTIVE WHEN YOU SAY

04:22:12.917 --> 04:22:15.286
TO THE LEADERSHIP YOU CAN'T HAVE

04:22:15.352 --> 04:22:16.654
A REYES YOU CAN HAVE YOUR 3%.

04:22:16.720 --> 04:22:17.888
WHATEVER IT IS COST OF LIVING

04:22:17.955 --> 04:22:18.489
WHATEVER IT IS YOU CAN'T HAVE

04:22:18.556 --> 04:22:19.924
THAT.

04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:21.926
IF YOU RAISE TUITION IS THAT

04:22:21.992 --> 04:22:22.893
REALLY GONNA.

04:22:22.960 --> 04:22:24.228
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S GONNA WORK

04:22:24.295 --> 04:22:25.396
THAT DECISION WOULD NOT YOU WANT

04:22:25.463 --> 04:22:26.931
TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION YOU'RE

04:22:26.997 --> 04:22:29.033
PUTTING THEIR SELF INTEREST NOW.

04:22:29.100 --> 04:22:30.835
INTO A DECISION ON TUITION.

04:22:30.901 --> 04:22:32.436
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT WELL I

04:22:32.503 --> 04:22:34.171
HAVEN'T MET A BOARD OF TRUSTEES

04:22:34.238 --> 04:22:36.207
YET -- IS AN ENTIRE BOARD THAT

04:22:36.273 --> 04:22:37.675
WASN'T REALLY QUITE EAGER TO

04:22:37.741 --> 04:22:39.410
RAISE STUDENT FEES SO I DON'T

04:22:39.477 --> 04:22:40.544
KNOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO REEL

04:22:40.611 --> 04:22:41.612
THEM IN.

04:22:41.679 --> 04:22:43.347
THIS DOES CREATE SOME PRESSURE

04:22:43.414 --> 04:22:45.116
THAT THEY APPARENTLY DON'T FEEL

04:22:45.182 --> 04:22:46.650
INTERNALLY.

04:22:46.717 --> 04:22:48.219
OKAY WELL I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE

04:22:48.285 --> 04:22:48.886
ANSWERING THE QUESTION JUST TO

04:22:48.953 --> 04:22:50.321
BE CLEAR.

04:22:50.387 --> 04:22:50.921
AND FROM THE TRUSTEES POINT OF

04:22:50.988 --> 04:22:52.156
VIEW.

04:22:52.223 --> 04:22:53.190
THEY'VE TO THE FROZEN

04:22:53.257 --> 04:22:56.360
PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES THE LAST I

04:22:56.427 --> 04:22:57.995
DON'T KNOW SEVEN EIGHT YEARS.

04:22:58.062 --> 04:23:01.165
AT EIGHT EIGHT WHEN YOU HIRE AT

04:23:01.232 --> 04:23:03.334
A A NEW PRESIDENT OF THE CAMPUS

04:23:03.400 --> 04:23:04.702
DID THEY PAY THEM MORE THAN THE

04:23:04.768 --> 04:23:06.437
PREDECESSOR.

04:23:06.504 --> 04:23:09.173
AND HUMBLED THOSE JUST SELECTED.

04:23:09.240 --> 04:23:10.407
AB THAT THE SYSTEM CAN ANSWER

04:23:10.474 --> 04:23:12.109
THAT. FOR THE FOR THE POLICY

04:23:12.176 --> 04:23:13.444
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD THEY CAN GO

04:23:13.511 --> 04:23:16.080
UP 210% THEY DO NOT GO ABOVE 10%

04:23:16.147 --> 04:23:17.414
THE BILL PAY THE PREVIOUS SALARY.

04:23:17.481 --> 04:23:18.849
OKAY SO THE BOARD SET OF POLICY

04:23:18.916 --> 04:23:20.084
THAT YOU CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER

04:23:20.151 --> 04:23:21.519
THAN 10%.

04:23:21.585 --> 04:23:22.653
OVER THE EXISTING SALARY OF THAT

04:23:22.720 --> 04:23:24.622
PRESIDENT WHO COULD HAVE BEEN

04:23:24.688 --> 04:23:25.623
THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS.

04:23:25.689 --> 04:23:26.123
RIGHT HAVING A LOT MORE

04:23:26.190 --> 04:23:29.059
EXPERIENCE BUT THANK YOU

04:23:29.126 --> 04:23:31.128
CREATING A IN A LOT I DON'T

04:23:31.195 --> 04:23:32.163
THINK THAT ONE ANSWER THAT.

04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:33.797
YEAH I DON'T THINK THAT YOU SEEN

04:23:33.864 --> 04:23:36.267
THAT THE TRUSTEES JUMPING UP AND

04:23:36.333 --> 04:23:37.601
DOWN TO GO RAISE TUITION EITHER.

04:23:37.668 --> 04:23:40.971
IT'S BEEN ONE TUITION INCREASE

04:23:41.038 --> 04:23:41.539
IN WHAT SEVEN YEARS IS THAT

04:23:41.605 --> 04:23:42.406
RIGHT.

04:23:42.473 --> 04:23:43.607
OKAY ONE TUITION INCREASE IN

04:23:43.674 --> 04:23:44.875
SEVEN YEARS HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL

04:23:44.942 --> 04:23:47.077
POLICY THAT PUTS A LIMIT A CAP

04:23:47.144 --> 04:23:48.379
ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN.

04:23:48.445 --> 04:23:50.548
PAY A PRESIDENT.

04:23:50.614 --> 04:23:51.182
SO WHERE IS THE REASON FOR THIS

04:23:51.248 --> 04:23:53.217
BILL. TO ANSWER YOUR CALL YOUR

04:23:53.284 --> 04:23:54.718
EARLIER QUESTION.

04:23:54.785 --> 04:23:57.354
MADAM CHAIR -- YOU LAST IF THIS.

04:23:57.421 --> 04:24:00.157
PROVIDES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE.

04:24:00.224 --> 04:24:01.725
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT DOES NOT

04:24:01.792 --> 04:24:03.794
NOTHING IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS --

04:24:03.861 --> 04:24:07.097
A AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION.

04:24:07.164 --> 04:24:09.233
WHAT IT DOES IS IT SETS FOR THAT

04:24:09.300 --> 04:24:11.402
YEAR JUST THAT YEAR WHERE THERE

04:24:11.468 --> 04:24:12.870
IS AN INCREASE IN TUITION THERE

04:24:12.937 --> 04:24:15.272
IS NO I EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

04:24:15.339 --> 04:24:16.473
INCREASE?

04:24:16.540 --> 04:24:18.175
YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF THAT IN

04:24:18.242 --> 04:24:20.144
SEVEN YEARS HAS BEEN ONE SO THAT

04:24:20.211 --> 04:24:21.045
ONE YEAR THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE

04:24:21.111 --> 04:24:22.179
TO RACE -- EXECUTIVE

04:24:22.246 --> 04:24:24.014
COMPENSATION BUT ALL THOSE OTHER

04:24:24.081 --> 04:24:24.515
YEARS THEY CAN CERTAINLY

04:24:24.582 --> 04:24:25.816
CONSIDER THAT.

04:24:25.883 --> 04:24:27.117
RIGHT WITH THE IF THE WHOLE IDEA

04:24:27.184 --> 04:24:28.485
IS TO LIVE PUT A LIMIT ON

04:24:28.552 --> 04:24:30.154
PRESIDENTIAL SALARIES.

04:24:30.221 --> 04:24:30.888
REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS

04:24:30.955 --> 04:24:32.122
ISN'T IT YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO

04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:33.290
RAISE TUITION HERE.

04:24:33.357 --> 04:24:34.425
TRYING TO CAP PRESIDENTIAL

04:24:34.491 --> 04:24:36.060
SALARIES.

04:24:36.126 --> 04:24:38.362
RIGHT THAT'S NOT THE GOAL.

04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:40.264
THE GOAL IS ACCOUNTABILITY --

04:24:40.331 --> 04:24:42.166
AND TO ENSURE THAT THE BOARD IS

04:24:42.233 --> 04:24:44.401
A GOOD STEWARDS OF THE FUNDING

04:24:44.468 --> 04:24:44.969
AND THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO

04:24:45.035 --> 04:24:48.005
RAISE.

04:24:48.072 --> 04:24:50.074
EVERYONE IF WE ARE HURTING AS A

04:24:50.140 --> 04:24:50.608
STATE.

04:24:50.674 --> 04:24:52.376
THAT NOT IF THE STUDENTS ARE

04:24:52.443 --> 04:24:54.445
GONNA HURT THE EXECUTIVE

04:24:54.511 --> 04:24:55.746
SHOULDN'T NECESSARILYBENEFIT AT

04:24:55.813 --> 04:24:56.947
THAT TIME ONE FINAL FOLLOW UP

04:24:57.014 --> 04:24:57.615
AND SHARE.

04:24:57.681 --> 04:24:58.983
IS THAT WELL THEN SHOULD YOU PUT

04:24:59.049 --> 04:25:00.818
THAT ON US THAT WERE THE ONE WHO

04:25:00.884 --> 04:25:01.385
PROVIDES THE BUDGET TO THE

04:25:01.452 --> 04:25:01.952
SYSTEM.

04:25:02.019 --> 04:25:03.554
SO SHOULD THIS LOSS SAY THAT WE

04:25:03.621 --> 04:25:04.922
CAN INCREASE LEGISLATIVE

04:25:04.989 --> 04:25:07.258
SALARIES IN A YEAR IN WHICH WE

04:25:07.324 --> 04:25:07.825
DON'T FULLY FIND.

04:25:07.891 --> 04:25:09.426
THE SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE TO RAISE

04:25:09.493 --> 04:25:11.028
TUITION I MEAN IS THAT IS NOT

04:25:11.095 --> 04:25:12.830
THE ACT OF PUTTING IT WHERE IT

04:25:12.896 --> 04:25:13.931
REALLY STARTS WHICH IS US.

04:25:13.998 --> 04:25:15.833
NOT THE PRESIDENT'S THEY'RE NOT

04:25:15.899 --> 04:25:17.735
THE ONES DECIDING ON TUITION.

04:25:17.801 --> 04:25:19.270
RIGHT THROUGH THE US IN THE

04:25:19.336 --> 04:25:19.903
BUDGET THAT WE FIND EVERY YEAR

04:25:19.970 --> 04:25:20.804
ISN'T IT MADAM CHAIRMAN ANSWER

04:25:20.871 --> 04:25:22.840
THE QUESTION SO WE THINK THAT

04:25:22.906 --> 04:25:25.743
THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- IN -- ARE.

04:25:25.809 --> 04:25:27.011
THEIR OWN ACCOUNTABILITY

04:25:27.077 --> 04:25:28.412
MEASURES FOR EXAMPLE YOU DON'T

04:25:28.479 --> 04:25:29.580
GET COMPENSATED OF THE BUDGET

04:25:29.647 --> 04:25:30.814
DOESN'T PASS SOMETIME.

04:25:30.881 --> 04:25:33.384
THAT'S GREAT IN TERMS OF THIS

04:25:33.450 --> 04:25:34.518
BODY.

04:25:34.585 --> 04:25:36.053
THE LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORITY

04:25:36.120 --> 04:25:37.288
OVER.

04:25:37.354 --> 04:25:39.523

EXCUSE ME THE TUITIONS KIND OF

04:26:02.980 --> 04:26:04.748
POINTS IN SEVEN YEARS I THINK A

04:26:04.815 --> 04:26:06.550
LOT OF THIS IS OPTICS AS WELL WE

THEY'RE SHELLING OUT MORE MONEY

04:26:12.656 --> 04:26:14.491

GOING TO HAVE TO SHELL OUT MORE

04:26:25.602 --> 04:26:26.904
MONEY TO GO TO SCHOOL.

04:26:26.970 --> 04:26:28.005

MANY OF US READING ABOUT IT THE

04:33:34.364 --> 04:33:35.665
INDIVIDUAL WHO STARTED THIS

04:33:35.732 --> 04:33:37.167
WHOLE PROGRAM LITERALLY STARTED

04:33:37.234 --> 04:33:38.535
IN MY DISTRICT YEARS YOU'RE VERY

04:33:38.602 --> 04:33:39.703
FAMILIAR.

04:33:39.770 --> 04:33:41.138
WITH THE WORK AND ONE OF THAT

04:33:41.204 --> 04:33:42.305
THE SCANS THAT WE SAW.

04:33:42.372 --> 04:33:45.308
WAS CHEATING RELATED TO THE

04:33:45.375 --> 04:33:47.411
COLLEGE ADMISSIONS -- TESTS SO

04:33:47.477 --> 04:33:48.645
IN SOME CASES THEY HAD THE

04:33:48.712 --> 04:33:51.181
PROCTOR GOING CHANGE THE ANSWERS.

04:33:51.248 --> 04:33:52.983
IN SOME CASES THEY HAD --

04:33:53.049 --> 04:33:55.352
INDIVIDUALS FAKE DISABILITIES

04:33:55.418 --> 04:34:00.257
AND GET MORE TIME TO TAKE THE-SAT AND SAT AND ACT EXAM.

04:34:00.323 --> 04:34:01.725
THIS OF COURSE IS WRONG BUT ALSO

04:34:01.792 --> 04:34:03.527
SOMETIMES A NUYS A SPOT FOR

04:34:03.593 --> 04:34:04.795
QUALIFIED CALIFORNIANS OF THAT

04:34:04.861 --> 04:34:07.030
WHY THIS REALLY MATTERS BUT THIS

04:34:07.097 --> 04:34:09.699
REALLY -- BAGS.

04:34:09.766 --> 04:34:10.600
LARGER QUESTION WHETHER THESE

04:34:10.667 --> 04:34:13.069
TASKS ARE REALLY APPLICABLES IN

04:34:13.136 --> 04:34:14.571
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SO WE

04:34:14.638 --> 04:34:16.740
KNOW THAT -- THAT YOU SEE IS

04:34:16.807 --> 04:34:18.508
TAKING UP A LOOK AT THIS -- WE

04:34:18.575 --> 04:34:19.943
KNOW THAT THERE ARE DOZENS OF

04:34:20.010 --> 04:34:22.345
COLLEGES ACROSS THE NATION THAT

04:34:22.412 --> 04:34:23.180
I'VE CHANGED OR STANDARDS FOR

04:34:23.246 --> 04:34:23.780
THESE.

04:34:23.847 --> 04:34:25.816
STANDARDIZED TESTS AND WHAT THIS

04:34:25.882 --> 04:34:27.684
MEASURE HERE WOULD ASK THE UC

04:34:27.751 --> 04:34:29.553
SYSTEM AND THE CSU TO CONDUCT A

04:34:29.619 --> 04:34:30.654
STUDY.

04:34:30.720 --> 04:34:32.122
ON THE USEFULNESS OF FACT IN

04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:33.723
THIS THE NEED FOR THE SAT TO

04:34:33.790 --> 04:34:35.559
DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS.

04:34:35.625 --> 04:34:37.794
STILL NEEDED TODAY WE KNOW THAT

04:34:37.861 --> 04:34:39.729
THE SYSTEMS -- CERTAINLY I'D

04:34:39.796 --> 04:34:41.765
NEEDED TO FOCUS ON THE HUGE

04:34:41.832 --> 04:34:43.633
VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THE KIND

04:34:43.700 --> 04:34:45.001
OF SORT PEOPLE IN SORT PEOPLE

04:34:45.068 --> 04:34:45.735
OUT.

04:34:45.802 --> 04:34:46.469
I THINK WE HAVE A LARGER

04:34:46.536 --> 04:34:50.440
SOCIETAL QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT

04:34:50.507 --> 04:34:52.876
THIS TRULY ON MEASURES STUDENT

04:34:52.943 --> 04:34:53.810
SUCCESS AND THERE ARE OTHERS

04:34:53.877 --> 04:34:54.711
STATE -- FUNDED UNIVERSITIES

04:34:54.778 --> 04:34:55.912
ACROSS THE NATION THAT HAVE GOT

04:34:55.979 --> 04:34:57.013
RID OF THE SYSTEM WE THINK THAT

04:34:57.080 --> 04:34:57.514
WE CAN.

04:34:57.581 --> 04:34:58.982
I TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAME THING

04:34:59.049 --> 04:35:00.951
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN THIS

04:35:01.017 --> 04:35:01.952
ISN'T.

04:35:02.018 --> 04:35:04.020
AT CERTAIN REMEDY THIS CERTAINLY

04:35:04.087 --> 04:35:05.655
ASK THE SYSTEMS THIS WOULD.

04:35:05.722 --> 04:35:07.224
IN ESSENCE AS A SYSTEM TO DO A

04:35:07.290 --> 04:35:08.992
THOROUGH STUDY IN EVALUATION

04:35:09.059 --> 04:35:11.361

PRIVILEGE OF ACCESSING --

04:35:42.392 --> 04:35:44.361
ALTHOUGH WE HELD SIMILAR GPAS IN

04:35:44.427 --> 04:35:45.629
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE

04:35:45.695 --> 04:35:46.730
TEST PREPARATION AND

04:35:46.796 --> 04:35:47.831
CONSEQUENTIALLY OUR SCORES

04:35:47.898 --> 04:35:53.637
RESULTED IN DIFFERENT EMISSIONS

04:35:53.703 --> 04:35:54.738
INTO UC'S MCSE IS.

04:35:54.804 --> 04:35:55.405

ADDITIONAL EXAMS APART WERE

04:35:58.975 --> 04:36:00.243
DENIED MISSION.

04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:01.378
THIS STORY IS NOT UNIQUE AND

04:36:01.444 --> 04:36:02.913
WHEN ANALYZING THE SAT SCORES OF

04:36:02.979 --> 04:36:04.481
STUDENTS ACROSS THE NATION.

04:36:04.547 --> 04:36:05.315
THEY'RE JUST.

04:36:05.382 --> 04:36:07.284
DISPARITIES AMONG MINORITIES AND

04:36:07.350 --> 04:36:08.585
LOWER INCOME SINCE COMPARISON TO

04:36:08.652 --> 04:36:10.854
THOSE AND HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC

04:36:10.921 --> 04:36:11.154

04:36:24.234 --> 04:36:25.302
TO TEST STUDENTS COLLEGE

04:36:25.368 --> 04:36:26.937
READINESS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S

04:36:27.003 --> 04:36:28.738
IMPERATIVE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN

04:36:28.805 --> 04:36:30.273
A CONVERSATION WITH THAT.

04:36:30.340 --> 04:36:31.675

04:36:31.741 --> 04:36:34.744
YOU SEE THE CSU.

04:36:34.811 --> 04:36:35.345
ESSENTIALLY THOSE WHO TOOK THE

04:36:35.412 --> 04:36:36.780
EXAMS AND WE SHOULD ASK THEM IF

04:36:36.846 --> 04:36:38.081
WHERE THEY TRULY EFFECTIVE.

04:36:38.148 --> 04:36:39.716
IF NOT WE'LL CONTINUE TO EXCLUDE

04:36:39.783 --> 04:36:40.650
QUALIFIED AND HARD WORKING

04:36:40.717 --> 04:36:42.452
STUDENTS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION

GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN I THOUGHT OF

04:36:55.999 --> 04:36:57.367
THIS MY GOLLY CAM KATE WITH

04:36:57.434 --> 04:36:58.535
ADVOCATES WE SUPPORT THIS

04:36:58.601 --> 04:36:59.970
RESOLUTION TO EXAMINE THE

04:37:00.036 --> 04:37:01.972
USEFULNESS OF THE SAT AND ACT

04:37:02.038 --> 04:37:03.606
AND COLLEGE ADMISSIONS.

04:37:03.673 --> 04:37:05.275
THESE HIGH STAKES TESTS CAN ACT

04:37:05.342 --> 04:37:07.510
AS BARRIERS TO COLLEGE ADMISSION

04:37:07.577 --> 04:37:09.012
FOR MANY LOW INCOME AND STUDENTS

04:37:09.079 --> 04:37:11.247
OF COLOR WHO CANNOT AFFORD

04:37:11.314 --> 04:37:12.749
EXPENSIVE TEST PREP AS WE HEARD

04:37:12.816 --> 04:37:14.150
OR WHO ATTEND HIGH SCHOOLS.

04:37:14.217 --> 04:37:15.685
THAT DON'T PROVIDE THE SUPPORT

04:37:15.752 --> 04:37:17.020
THEY NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE

04:37:17.087 --> 04:37:18.254
RECENTLY THE PRESIDENT OF THE

04:37:18.321 --> 04:37:19.389
COLLEGE BOARD ADMITTED THAT

04:37:19.456 --> 04:37:21.391
WEALTH INEQUALITY HAS PROGRESSED

04:37:21.458 --> 04:37:22.192
TO SUCH A DEGREE.

04:37:22.258 --> 04:37:24.227
THAT IT ISN'T FAIR TO LOOK AT

04:37:24.294 --> 04:37:25.962
TEST SCORES ALONE AND THAT WE

04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:27.998
MUST LOOK AT THEM IN CONTEXT OF

04:37:28.064 --> 04:37:29.532
THE ADVERSITY STUDENTS FACE.

AFTER BMP COMMITTEE WE DID HAVE

04:51:12.388 --> 04:51:13.622
A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN.

04:51:13.689 --> 04:51:16.292
THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL ISSUE

04:51:16.358 --> 04:51:17.493
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYMENT.

04:51:17.560 --> 04:51:18.427
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE PAY OUR

04:51:18.494 --> 04:51:19.929
EMPLOYEES WERE TALKING ABOUT

04:51:19.995 --> 04:51:20.763
THEIR CONTRACTS.

04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:22.464
ON THESE AGAIN ARE COMPLICATED

04:51:22.531 --> 04:51:23.933
ISSUES THAT ARE VERY LEGAL

04:51:23.999 --> 04:51:25.901
ORIENTED WHERE YOU KNOW EVERY

04:51:25.968 --> 04:51:27.169
WORD DOES MATTER.

04:51:27.236 --> 04:51:28.871
SO IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT

04:51:28.938 --> 04:51:30.439
THEY ACCEPTED A LOT OF OUR

04:51:30.506 --> 04:51:31.340
LANGUAGE.

04:51:31.407 --> 04:51:33.175
BUT SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT

04:51:33.242 --> 04:51:34.643
PIECES THAT THAT MATTER TO US

04:51:34.710 --> 04:51:35.945
THEY DID NOT SO THOSE ARE THOSE

04:51:36.011 --> 04:51:36.545
ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE STILL

04:51:36.612 --> 04:51:38.347
NEED TO RESOLVE IF WE ARE GOING

04:51:38.414 --> 04:51:39.882
TO COME TO A RESOLUTION.

04:51:39.949 --> 04:51:41.350
AND WHY IS THAT SO IMPORTANT.

04:51:41.417 --> 04:51:43.085
WE AGREE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL

04:51:43.152 --> 04:51:44.787
CONCEPT OF THE BILL RIGHT WE WE

04:51:44.854 --> 04:51:45.721
ARE NOT PAIN ARE EMPLOYEES OF

04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:47.256
BASED ON THESE QUOTAS IT'S

04:51:47.323 --> 04:51:48.524
AGAINST FEDERAL LAW IT'S AGAINST

04:51:48.591 --> 04:51:49.692
STATE LAW.

04:51:49.758 --> 04:51:52.261
OUR TITLE FOR ELIGIBILITY IS

04:51:52.328 --> 04:51:55.030
DEPENDENT ON SO THIS IS UNDER

04:51:55.097 --> 04:51:56.565
FEDERAL LAW AND THEY MENTION THE

04:51:56.632 --> 04:51:58.133
PREVIOUS WITNESS MANSON BUSH AND

04:51:58.200 --> 04:51:58.901
TRUMP.

04:51:58.968 --> 04:52:01.170
IT WAS ACTUALLY OBAMA AND A BOMB

04:52:01.237 --> 04:52:03.272
IS ADMINISTRATION THAT SET THE

04:52:03.339 --> 04:52:04.139
CURRENT GUIDELINES.

04:52:04.206 --> 04:52:06.108
THE RELEASED THEIR RAGS AND THEY

04:52:06.175 --> 04:52:07.576
RELEASED A DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER

04:52:07.643 --> 04:52:09.879
THAT IS VERY SPECIFIC.

04:52:09.945 --> 04:52:10.713
TO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU CAN

04:52:10.779 --> 04:52:11.680
DO THESE ARE THE THINGS YOU

04:52:11.747 --> 04:52:13.382
CAN'T DO LOTS OF QUESTIONS LOTS

04:52:13.449 --> 04:52:15.618
OF EXAMPLES WE DO NOT HAVE THAT

04:52:15.684 --> 04:52:16.919
GUIDANCE IN THIS LAW.

04:52:16.986 --> 04:52:18.254
AND FOR THOSE WHO WORK WITH THE

04:52:18.320 --> 04:52:21.824
BUREAU I DOUBT WE WOULD GET THAT

04:52:21.891 --> 04:52:22.892
SORT OF GUIDANCE FROM THEM -- I

04:52:22.958 --> 04:52:23.726
DON'T EVEN KNOW FORGET

04:52:23.792 --> 04:52:25.427
REGULATIONS ON THAT SO WE HAVE

04:52:25.494 --> 04:52:27.596
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATUTE IS

04:52:27.663 --> 04:52:29.198
SO CLEAR FOR US.

04:52:29.265 --> 04:52:30.532
BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS HOW WE'RE

04:52:30.599 --> 04:52:32.067
SETTING OUR CONTRACT WITH OUR

04:52:32.134 --> 04:52:33.836
EMPLOYEES THIS IS HOW WE'RE

04:52:33.903 --> 04:52:34.803
PAYING OUR EMPLOYEES.

04:52:34.870 --> 04:52:36.272
WE BELIEVE SOME OF THE WORDS AND

04:52:36.338 --> 04:52:37.840
THE BILL NOW ARE VERY VAGUE AND

04:52:37.907 --> 04:52:39.708
WILL CAPTURE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE

04:52:39.775 --> 04:52:42.278
NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED.

04:52:42.344 --> 04:52:43.412
IN THE ENROLLMENT FOR ADMISSIONS

04:52:43.479 --> 04:52:45.047
PROCESS THIS COULD BE THE

04:52:45.114 --> 04:52:46.582

04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:55.591
WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT WE STILL

04:52:55.658 --> 04:52:57.092
BELIEVE IS BIG ENOUGH THAT TO

04:52:57.159 --> 04:52:58.093
CAPTURE THAT.

04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.862

DRAFTED THE FIRST TRACK AND THAT

04:59:19.207 --> 04:59:19.808
MAYBE WAS A LITTLE TOO BROAD AND

04:59:19.875 --> 04:59:22.244
SO WE IT WE ARE WORKING WITH

04:59:22.311 --> 04:59:23.278

05:00:04.553 --> 05:00:06.021
TO BROUGHT OF AN EXEMPTION.

05:00:06.088 --> 05:00:07.656
BUT I THINK THAT'S DOABLE AND

05:00:07.723 --> 05:00:08.523
I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH

05:00:08.590 --> 05:00:11.226

05:00:19.267 --> 05:00:21.503
CONTROVERSIAL BUT IT'S A MUCH

05:00:21.570 --> 05:00:23.171
BIGGER ISSUE THAN.

05:00:23.238 --> 05:00:24.406

IN THAT TERRITORY SO I IS I

05:00:36.551 --> 05:00:38.153

THIS ISSUE ABSENT IN A CA.

05:38:58.418 --> 05:38:59.352
I WANT TO MENTION I DON'T THINK

05:38:59.419 --> 05:39:00.053
THAT'S ENTIRELY ACCURATE IN FACT

05:39:00.119 --> 05:39:01.120
THIS IS THE FIFTH YEAR THAT ASK

05:39:01.187 --> 05:39:02.722
ME IS BROUGHT THIS TYPE OF BILL

05:39:02.789 --> 05:39:03.790
THIS TYPE OF EFFORT FORWARD.

05:39:03.856 --> 05:39:05.358
EACH OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS

05:39:05.425 --> 05:39:06.693
INCLUDING THREE YEARS OF BILLS

05:39:06.759 --> 05:39:09.328
BY CENTER LARA AND THE BILL LAST

05:39:09.395 --> 05:39:10.863
YEAR BY MISS WEBER.

05:39:10.930 --> 05:39:11.531
UNIVERSITY HAS STATED VERY

05:39:11.597 --> 05:39:13.466
CLEARLY THAT IF THE BILLS WERE

05:39:13.533 --> 05:39:14.600
TO PASS THESE ARE BILLS THAT

05:39:14.667 --> 05:39:16.069
AFFECTED THE UNIVERSITY OF

05:39:16.135 --> 05:39:17.370
PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE.

05:39:17.437 --> 05:39:18.304
THAT THOSE WOULD IMPACT

05:39:18.371 --> 05:39:19.672
UNIVERSITY DIRECTLY AND WE WOULD

05:39:19.739 --> 05:39:21.641
BE PROHIBITED FROM BEHAVE IN THE

05:39:21.708 --> 05:39:22.642
WAY THAT THOSE BILLS WERE

05:39:22.709 --> 05:39:24.077
OTHERWISE PRECLUDING US FROM. TO

05:39:24.143 --> 05:39:25.445
THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED

05:39:25.511 --> 05:39:27.080
EARLIER ABOUT THIS BEING A ALONG

05:39:27.146 --> 05:39:28.381
PHASE AND THE A. C. A. B. ALONG

05:39:28.448 --> 05:39:29.716
PHASE AND I THINK THERE'S A

05:39:29.782 --> 05:39:31.017
MISNOMER THAT SOMEHOW THE

05:39:31.084 --> 05:39:33.186
UNIVERSITY HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF

05:39:33.252 --> 05:39:34.420
TEN YEAR CONTRACTS.

05:39:34.487 --> 05:39:35.955
AND IT TO EXTEND THE DAC WERE TO

05:39:36.022 --> 05:39:36.889
PASS WOULD BE A TEN YEAR

05:39:36.956 --> 05:39:38.291
GRADUATED PHASE AND I ALSO

05:39:38.357 --> 05:39:39.358
DISAGREE THAT THAT'S THE CASE I

05:39:39.425 --> 05:39:40.159
THINK THAT THE UNIVERSITY

05:39:40.226 --> 05:39:41.894
CALIFORNIA TYPICALLY HAS TWO AND

05:39:41.961 --> 05:39:43.029
THREE YEAR CONTRACTS.

05:39:43.096 --> 05:39:45.231
AND AS WE READ THE THE LANGUAGE

05:39:45.298 --> 05:39:47.667
OF ACA FOURTEEN IT SUGGESTS THAT

05:39:47.734 --> 05:39:48.935
THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACA WOULD

05:39:49.001 --> 05:39:50.570
TAKE EFFECT AT THE EARLY STATE

05:39:50.636 --> 05:39:51.871
UPON WHICH I THE CONTRACT

05:39:51.938 --> 05:39:53.406
EXPIRES.

05:39:53.473 --> 05:39:54.006
OR WHEN THE CONTRACT COULD BE

05:39:54.073 --> 05:39:54.640
AMENDED.

05:39:54.707 --> 05:39:56.743
THE CONTRACT COULD BE AMENDED AT

05:39:56.809 --> 05:39:58.344
ANY TIME SO IN OUR MINDS

05:39:58.411 --> 05:40:00.646
EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST EIGHT

05:40:00.713 --> 05:40:01.581
THIS IS A C. WERE TAKE AFFECT.

05:40:01.647 --> 05:40:02.548
THOSE CONTRACTS TO BE SUBJECT TO

05:40:02.615 --> 05:40:07.987
THE EFFECTS OF THIS A CA AS WELL.

05:40:08.054 --> 05:40:10.823
AND THEN LASTLY -- I JUST WANT

05:40:10.890 --> 05:40:11.424
TO TOUCH ON THE FISCAL FOR A

05:40:11.491 --> 05:40:12.091
MOMENT I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE

05:40:12.158 --> 05:40:13.359
FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT OUR LETTER

05:40:13.426 --> 05:40:14.293
HAS ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FISCAL

05:40:14.360 --> 05:40:15.528
ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY

05:40:15.595 --> 05:40:16.329
TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF THIS A CA

05:40:16.395 --> 05:40:16.863
WERE TO PASS.

05:40:16.929 --> 05:40:17.997
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IS

05:40:18.064 --> 05:40:20.466
THE EFFECT OF BOTH THE WAGE --

05:40:20.533 --> 05:40:22.769
PREMIUM AND THE BENEFIT PREMIUM

05:40:22.835 --> 05:40:24.370
THAT THE UNIVERSITY BE REQUIRED

05:40:24.437 --> 05:40:25.738
TO COVER IN THE EVENT THAT WE

05:40:25.805 --> 05:40:27.273
HAD TO BRING THIS WORK IN HOUSE

05:40:27.340 --> 05:40:29.342
IS -- CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT

05:40:29.408 --> 05:40:31.377
THE LANGUAGE A CA DOES NOT SAY

05:40:31.444 --> 05:40:33.646
WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SAME

05:40:33.713 --> 05:40:35.248
NUMBERS WORKERS IF THE AC WERE

05:40:35.314 --> 05:40:36.082
TO PASS AS WE HAVE NOW ON

05:40:36.149 --> 05:40:37.083
CONTACTED STATUS.

05:40:37.150 --> 05:40:38.417
BUT THE FACT IS THE WORK DOES

05:40:38.484 --> 05:40:40.419
NEED TO BE DONE AND WE DO EXPECT

05:40:40.486 --> 05:40:41.220
TO BRING ON EACH AND EVERY

05:40:41.287 --> 05:40:43.222
PERSON THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED --

05:40:43.289 --> 05:40:44.891
IF THE AC OR TO PASS SO WITHOUT

05:40:44.957 --> 05:40:46.726
I WANTED TURNED OVER TO MY

05:40:46.793 --> 05:40:48.161

05:41:01.073 --> 05:41:02.575
JUST DIDN'T SHORT.

05:41:02.642 --> 05:41:05.244
THE LIMITATIONS THAT A CA -- IT

05:41:05.311 --> 05:41:07.146
WOULD IMPACT WOULD IMPACT --

05:41:07.213 --> 05:41:08.514
PATIENT CARE -- THERE'S AN

05:41:08.581 --> 05:41:09.649

THEY'RE ALSO EMPLOYED AT OTHER

05:41:17.156 --> 05:41:19.225

NOT A COMPLETE SOLUTION IT IS

05:41:30.736 --> 05:41:31.170

05:43:06.132 --> 05:43:07.934
THIS.

05:43:08.000 --> 05:43:10.303
AS HAS BEEN RAISED THERE WERE

05:43:10.369 --> 05:43:13.506
PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS -- TO APPROACH

05:43:13.572 --> 05:43:15.875
THIS ISSUE LEGISLATIVELY THOSE

05:43:15.942 --> 05:43:17.343
WERE ATTEMPTS TO REGULATE THE

05:43:17.410 --> 05:43:18.778
PRIVATE SECTOR.

05:43:18.844 --> 05:43:20.713
THIS IS AN EFFORT TO ACTUALLY

05:43:20.780 --> 05:43:22.548
BRING THIS PUBLIC INSTITUTION IN

05:43:22.615 --> 05:43:23.749
LINE WITH SISTER PUBLIC

05:43:23.816 --> 05:43:26.352
INSTITUTIONS.

05:43:26.419 --> 05:43:28.187
MY QUESTION IS IS THIS A MATTER

05:43:28.254 --> 05:43:29.455
IS AT THAT AND DISCUSSED IN

05:43:29.522 --> 05:43:30.823
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH THE

05:43:30.890 --> 05:43:32.658
WITH YOU SEE.

05:43:32.725 --> 05:43:34.827
THIS IS A CONCERN FOR WORKERS AT

05:43:34.894 --> 05:43:38.331
UC HOWEVER THE ACA IS A MATTER

05:43:38.397 --> 05:43:40.166
OF PUBLIC POLICY IT IS DIFFERENT

05:43:40.232 --> 05:43:41.634
FROM AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN TWO

05:43:41.701 --> 05:43:43.002
PRIVATE PARTIES.

05:43:43.069 --> 05:43:44.036
RIGHT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

05:43:44.103 --> 05:43:46.238
THAT THAT BEFORE PULLING THE

05:43:46.305 --> 05:43:48.541
TRIGGER ON AN ACA.

05:43:48.607 --> 05:43:49.642
WHAT IS THE PROCESS THAT'S GONE

05:43:49.709 --> 05:43:50.910
FORTH WITHIN THE INSTITUTION

05:43:50.977 --> 05:43:52.278
ITSELF TO JUSTIFY THIS TYPE OF

05:43:52.345 --> 05:43:53.512
ACTION?

05:43:53.579 --> 05:43:54.547
NO YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR

05:43:54.613 --> 05:43:56.248
LEGISLATIVE ACTION ALTHOUGH YOU

05:43:56.315 --> 05:43:56.782
NEED US TO PUT THIS ON THE

05:43:56.849 --> 05:43:58.084
BALLOT.

05:43:58.150 --> 05:43:59.085
REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS

05:43:59.151 --> 05:44:00.553
THE SUBJECT OF COLLECTIVE

05:44:00.619 --> 05:44:02.121
BARGAINING LET'S START THERE.

05:44:02.188 --> 05:44:03.456
IN THE UC SYSTEM.

05:44:03.522 --> 05:44:05.925
THERE ISN'T EFFORTS -- TO

05:44:05.992 --> 05:44:06.959
ADDRESS THIS IN COLLECTIVE

05:44:07.026 --> 05:44:08.661
BARGAINING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

05:44:08.728 --> 05:44:11.197
RESPONSE TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S

05:44:11.263 --> 05:44:12.031
EFFORTS.

05:44:12.098 --> 05:44:13.966
LEGISLATIVELY AND REPEATED CALLS

05:44:14.033 --> 05:44:15.735
FROM WORKERS AT THE UNIVERSITY

05:44:15.801 --> 05:44:18.237
IS ACTUALLY AN EXPANSION.

05:44:18.304 --> 05:44:22.008
OF A CONTRACTING OF THIS WORK SO

05:44:22.074 --> 05:44:24.410
WE HAVE SEEN ACTUALLY MORE

05:44:24.477 --> 05:44:26.012
OUTSOURCING.

05:44:26.078 --> 05:44:27.213
OF THIS WORK NOT LESS AT THE

05:44:27.279 --> 05:44:28.781
UNIVERSITY OF MY QUESTION IS IS

05:44:28.848 --> 05:44:30.116
THIS A MATTER THAT'S BEEN

05:44:30.182 --> 05:44:32.918
SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

05:44:32.985 --> 05:44:35.321
THIS IS A CONCERN IN COLLECTIVE

05:44:35.388 --> 05:44:36.522
BARGAINING AND ACT AND DO YOU

05:44:36.589 --> 05:44:37.289
HAVE THE ABILITY WITHIN

05:44:37.356 --> 05:44:38.624
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO REACH

05:44:38.691 --> 05:44:40.326
THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS ABOUT

05:44:40.393 --> 05:44:41.494
OUTSOURCING.

05:44:41.560 --> 05:44:42.661
THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE

05:44:42.728 --> 05:44:44.830
DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH

05:44:44.897 --> 05:44:46.532
A PUBLIC POLICY THAT ENSURES

05:44:46.599 --> 05:44:47.967
THAT PEOPLE ARE TREATED EQUAL AT

05:44:48.034 --> 05:44:50.669
THE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS.

05:44:50.736 --> 05:44:52.338
WHAT THIS IS?

05:44:52.405 --> 05:44:53.406
I THINK IN IN FOR CLARIFICATION

05:44:53.472 --> 05:44:54.273
SO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS

05:44:54.340 --> 05:44:56.709
GOING TO DETERMINE THE WORKERS

05:44:56.776 --> 05:44:58.110
AT THE UNIVERSITY ALREADY THIS

05:44:58.177 --> 05:44:59.979
DOESN'T TOUCH THE WORKERS -- AND

05:45:00.046 --> 05:45:01.480
IN THE APPS ME COLLECTIVE

05:45:01.547 --> 05:45:02.648
BARGAINING UNIT IT TOUCHES

05:45:02.715 --> 05:45:04.283
WORKERS THAT DON'T HAVE A UNION

05:45:04.350 --> 05:45:05.618
WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

05:45:05.684 --> 05:45:06.552
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS SO

05:45:06.619 --> 05:45:07.953
THAT'S I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

05:45:08.020 --> 05:45:09.021
MAKES IT MORE CLEAR.

05:45:09.088 --> 05:45:10.990
AND SO THAT GOES BEYOND THE THE

05:45:11.057 --> 05:45:12.191
THE SCOPE OF COLLECTIVE

05:45:12.258 --> 05:45:14.593
BARGAINING FOR IT ASKED ME

THIRTY TO NINETY NINE WORKERS.

05:45:15.394 --> 05:45:18.164
OKAY SO CONTRACTING OUT IS NOT

05:45:18.230 --> 05:45:19.265
AN S. AND SUBJECT OF THAT

05:45:19.331 --> 05:45:21.133
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITHIN

UNDERSTANDING THEN.

05:45:26.505 --> 05:45:28.574
WE HAVE AND WE DO RAISE THE

05:45:28.641 --> 05:45:31.043
CONCERN OF CONTRACTING OUT IN

05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:33.179
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

05:45:33.245 --> 05:45:35.214
THAT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS FROM

05:45:35.281 --> 05:45:36.916
THE CONCERNED WE'RE ADDRESSING

05:45:36.982 --> 05:45:38.717
HERE WHICH IS CREATING AS A

05:45:38.784 --> 05:45:41.887
MATTER OF POLICY PUBLIC POLICY.

05:45:41.954 --> 05:45:45.791
THAT CAN EXTEND. FOR GENERATIONS.

05:45:45.858 --> 05:45:47.993
THAT THOSE DOING THE SAME WORK

05:45:48.060 --> 05:45:48.594
AT THE UNIVERSITY BE TREATED

05:45:48.661 --> 05:45:51.063

05:52:33.031 --> 05:52:34.600

NO ONE SHOULD SEE IT AS

05:52:58.957 --> 05:53:00.259
SOMETHING IT'S EASY. ONE OF THE

05:53:00.325 --> 05:53:01.760
REASONS I RAN FOR OFFICE IS
