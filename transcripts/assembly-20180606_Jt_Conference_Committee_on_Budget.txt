RECONVENING. ARE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA START WITH ISSUE ONE. JUDGESHIPS WILL START WITH LA ELLEN THEN GO BACK TO MISS COSTA. THE FIRST PART. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR JUDGESHIPS. AYE IN THE CROWDED COURTHOUSE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE SENATE PROVIDED ONE POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT A NEW APPELLATE COURT JUSTICE AT THE FOURTH DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL IN SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE AREA. USUALLY JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AS YOU DELIBERATE THIS ISSUE. BOTH HOUSES ESSENTIALLY MADE JUDICIAL RESOURCES A PRIORITY BY ALLOCATING THIS UNDING THE DIFFERENCE IS A GROUP OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IS REALLY HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE AND WHERE TO PROVIDE IT WHETHER IT'S PROVIDED THE TRIAL COURT AT THIS AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON TRIAL COURT JUDGESHIP MEANS BECAUSE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS REQUIRED. TO PREPARE AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE EVERY OTHER YEAR ON THAT NEED. WE HAVE LESS INFORMATION ON THE APPELLATE JUSTICE NEED AND SO WITHOUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THIS COST. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IN THE COST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M GOING TO SAY AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA THAT I WILL OFTEN BE REPEATING MYSELF TODAY SO I WILL TRY AND MAKE IT BRIEF. BUT MANY OF THE ISSUES BEFORE US TODAY ARE LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS ARE PREDICATED ON THE HIGHER REVENUES ON THAT WERE ADOPTED IN BOTH HOUSES I BUDGET PACKAGE THAT SUCH WERE NOT IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THEM AT THIS TIME. ON AS FOR ISSUE ONE THESE ARE BOTH LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CANNOT SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. NOT TO COMMIT ANY COMMENTS MORE QUESTIONS. OKAY ISSUE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SENATE NIELSEN. THIS KIND OF AN OPENING. QUESTION BUT IT'S ABOUT PROCESS MISTER CHAIRMAN. BUT WHAT I'M WONDERING WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'VE NOW GONE TO ABOUT A WEEK. AND VOTED ON MAYBE THREE OR FOUR THINGS. S. IT IS DISTURBING TO ME. ARE WE GOING TO AMALGAMATE A WHOLE BUNCH OF ISSUES. AND JUST RUSHED RIGHT THROUGH AND VOTE OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT ISSUE BY ISSUE. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY AS A TIME WHEN WE VOTE SO WE WILL HAVE MOTIONS WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS WE CAN. OFFER AMENDMENTS WE CAN HAVE DISK THAT THAT'S WAY THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES WORK AROUND HERE AND THIS IS VERY VERY HUGE DEPARTURE AND I'M AFRAID THAT WE'RE GONNA. CUT OUT THE PUBLIC HERE AND THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IF WE BOUGHT. VOTE A BIG HOLE LIST IS THAT THE PLAN. SO THE IDEA WAS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DISCUSS AND. HA ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE ITEMS AND TO HAVE A ROBUST DEBATE THAT IN A PUBLIC SETTING BUT THEN WHEN DO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS MEMBERS TO SAY YES WE'D LIKE THIS WOULD LIKE TO AMEND IT. THAT WOULD HAVE TO OFFER A AND ITEM THAT DID TO BE NOT AND CONFERENCE. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN I MEAN THIS IS EXTREMELY? I THINK RISKY DEPARTURE FROM OUR HISTORIC PROCESS. ALSO THERE WILL BE A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS THAT WE WILL VOTE ON FIVE OR SIX OF TEN OR FIFTEEN OF THESE IS THAT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AYE I THINK IF THERE ARE. ITEMS THAT WE HAVE A BROAD AGREEMENT ON I THINK WE'VE MADE MAY HANDLE IT THAT WAY. BUT OBVIOUSLY IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT THERE ARE USED TO BE MORE DISCUSSION THOSE ISSUES CAN BE TAKEN ON BY WORK. OKAY WELL THEN I WILL BE PROBABLY RAISING QUITE A FEW ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS. IN OTHER THAN THIS FORMAT IN DUST GO NOW WE WE WILL BE DISCUSSING IN A WAY WHEREBY THE MEMBERS CAN OFFER. CHANGES AND WE CAN HAVE SOME NEGOTIATION IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND AND. MAKE SUGGESTIONS OF DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK ANY TIME. DURING THIS STE. THE LIBERATION THERE'S ALWAYS THOUGHT ALWAYS OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK CAPITAL POINT US WELL I INQUIRE MISS CHAIRMAN BECAUSE PEOPLE. STREAMING INTO OUR OFFICE. CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. AND. I I I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE OUGHT NOT DO IT IN THIS MANNER AND FORMAT IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD RETURN TO THE HISTORIC AND NORMAL PROCESS. THINK YOU DO DULY NOTED. MISTER ROBERTS. IT ONE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT I BELIEVE MISTER OPEN TO WHAT'S TO TALK ABOUT ISSUE ONCE A WERE. GONNA STAND ISSUE ONE RIGHT NOW. SURE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THIS IS SOMETHING I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. WE JUST WANNA POINT OUT THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS ASSESS JUDICIAL NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF JUDGESHIPS FOR THE WORKLOAD RIGHT NOW. IS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY JUDGES SO THIS IS A VERY MODEST AUGMENTATION. I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT. WE COME TO SOME KIND OF COMPROMISES TO WEAR THESE PUT THESE JUDGES GET PUT. OUT SINCE THE TWO COUNTIES WITH THE LARGEST ASSESSED ASSESS NEED RIGHT NOW ARE RIVERSIDE INSANE MEDINA COUNTY. I THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE A A GOOD PLACE TO PUT THEM I HAD A REQUEST IN FOR TEN JUDGESHIPS WOULD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF A MODEST DOWN PAYMENT ON THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY. THAT IS THE NEED A FOUR WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING. TEN WOULD BE EVEN BETTER THAN FOR. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY. ADDITIONAL SENATE MITCHELL I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOT ONE. CONFEREE WHO'S NOT HERE I'M SENATOR ROTH WHO IS ON THE RULES COMMITTEE I DON'T KNOW THAT HE. PACIFIC WE ONCE THAT COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE BUT I JUST WANT TO ALERT EVERYONE THAT HE'S. NOT JUST IN MY EIGHTIES AND RULES COMMITTEE AND SO IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY COMES BACK IF THERE ARE SOME ISSUES HE WANTS TO RACE ON MY HOPE THAT HE'LL BE AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY. JEFF I'M CASE THIS ISSUE OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE DISCUSS IT IS APT. I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO HOW TO ACCOMMODATE ANY AND ALL REQUESTS BY DIFFERENT CULTURE RESTRICTING. IT'S A. OKAY ISSUE TO. HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WELL. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN BROWN WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ISSUE TO THE ASSEMBLY ADDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING GRANT. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES GRANTS TO SUPPORT VICTIMS OF SEX OR LABOR TRAFFICKING. AND THIS INCLUDES THE PROVIDE EMERGENCY SHELTER FOOD AND CLOTHING COUNSELING AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE. FOR CONTACT THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PROGRAM ON A ONE TIME BASIS. DOES NOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THERE'S NO FUNDING IN THE BASE FOR THAT. IN PAST YEARS OF THE TWO PRIOR YEAR THERE WAS FUNDED AT TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. BECAUSE ARMS CROSSED. THE LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. OKAY ISSUES THREE. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE. ETCETERA I WOULD REQUEST THAT THIS BE NOT VOTED ON. YOU KNOW AMALGAM OF OTHER ISSUES THAT THIS BE A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT ISSUE WHATEVER WE GET AROUND VOTING. ISSUE NUMBER THREE NUMBER THREE SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU. I NEED EARLIER THE LA L.. ON THIS ISSUE OF THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION ONGOING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS. LOCATED IN THREE REGIONS OF THE STATE TO INVESTIGATE LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AT THE REQUEST OF A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OR A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OFFICE. THE SENATE DID NOT. INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE SENATE ACTION AND IS AS IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER SUFFICIENT WORKLOAD EXISTS TO JUSTIFY THE RESOURCES. HE WAS BECAUSE. THIS IS AN ONGOING LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. SO NOTED SO ISSUE THREE WITH HAS BEEN A REQUEST HANDLE THIS SEPARATELY WHICH IS FINE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU. I WONDER AND PERHAPS THE ASSEMBLY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS BECAUSE WE THE SENATE DIDN'T HEAR IT BUT. THESE POSITIONS ARE THEY. ARE THEY THE LAWYER A LEGAL TEAM OR THE. PEACE OFFICER TEAM THAT WOULD HANDLE THESE INVESTIGATIONS. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT MOSTLY ATTORNEYS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE HANDLING OF THE INVESTIGATION DUTIES. THERE ARE I KNOW. FOUR STATES NOW THAT HAVE SET UP SOMETHING. PERHAPS NOT THE SAME BUT COMPARABLE IN THEIR. AG'S OFFICE. I THE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HEAR IT IN MY SUB. WE DIDN'T HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY EVALUATE WHETHER. THIS IS. WHETHER THIS IS. MORE. MORE PERSONNEL THAN MIGHT BE NEEDED. YOU NO NOT SEEN DATA AS TO WHETHER THEIR IS. WHAT THE LEVEL OF WORKLOAD MIGHT BE? BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT NOW HAVE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORY TEAMS FOR OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I WOULD ARGUE AND I DO WANT ARGUE THIS SEPARATELY. IN WHATEVER WE GET AROUND TO VOTING ON THIS BUT. THIS IS. DUPLICATIVE. ALREADY ONE WE HAVE THESE THE DEPARTMENT. CONDUCTION INVESTIGATION. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY. CAN INVESTIGATE. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT CAN BE REFERRED TO THESE GENERAL GENERAL. THAT HAS HAPPENED EVEN HERE RECENTLY. SO I REALLY SEE NO NEED. FOR THIS SO CALLED TEAM OF WHATEVER THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING INVESTIGATORY TEAM. THANK YOU SIR. SOME OF THE BOOK IT'S ONE ANNA A QUICK COMMENT ABOUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF. HOW THIS WOULD WORK IS THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO? I ENGAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DO AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION IT WOULD NOT BE MANDATORY. AND AS FOR THE FOR JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. I'D BELIEVE IT'S A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU SEVERAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I IN THE SAME LINE OF THINKING. IF WE'RE GOING TO USE PEACE OFFICERS. AND I I'M WONDERING. ABOUT THE WISDOM OF BETTERING THIRTY SEVEN NEW EMPLOYEES TO THE. STATE PAYROLL. SINCE. PEACE OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA RETIRED A NICE AGE OF FIFTY AND THAT THEY DO. WE WE HAVE A POOL OF RETIRED. POLICE OFFICERS I COULD DO. THIS WORK ON AN ON CALL BASIS AS OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION. FOR LIKE JAMS SURFER RETIRED JUDGES THAT YOU CAN USE. WHEN YOU NEED THEM BECAUSE AVERAGE I DON'T KNOW. WHAT CASH? IN THE END KIND OF A SAD STATEMENT ABOUT CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE EXPECTING THAT MANY POLICE SHOOTINGS TO INVESTIGATE. ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT. I I HOPE THAT'S. NOT GOING TO COME TO FRUITION BUT ALSO AN ISSUE TO WORK. USING OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS AS IT RELATES TO. TRAFFICKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING I'M ASSUMING THOSE ARE NOT PROFITS AND. OTHERS LIKE THAT'S ALL I THINK THAT MODEL IS IS A GOOD ONE TO PURSUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY IF NOT ON FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS. TARA LIKE THAT WOULD BE IT ARE A SEPARATE ITEM TO PLEASE. SO NOTED. SO IT. BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR. SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE AND SO THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO DOJ'S IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT FOR THE LEVEL. OF UNPROCESSED SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS IN THE STATE. THE SENATE PROVIDED SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TO DOJ TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THE BACKLOG OF THIS ON PROCESSED EVIDENCE. FUNDING COULD BE PROVIDED TO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES ND THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH. AND TO DOJ WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A REPORT. REPORTING ON THE IN THE CITIES AND COUNTIES  RECEIVE THE GRANTS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH EVIDENCE WAS PROCESSED. WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THIS ITEM AS IT WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE BACKLOG IS. HOW MUCH RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED TO ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG AND POTENTIALLY WHAT THE NEED WOULD BE ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN THE FUTURE TO AVOID A BACKLOG ENTIRELY? THE US COAST. THANK YOU THIS IS AGAIN A LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME WE WOULD HOWEVER NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES NOT HAVE A BACKLOG. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS IT'S UNKNOWN ONTO THE ANALYSTS POINT OUT WHAT THE BACKLOG IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY THIS INFORMATION IS NOT TRACK. AT THE STATE LEVEL. SORCERER. THANK YOU. SO FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT FOLLOW THIS ISSUE WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG. THEY ARE REFERRING TO. THEIR LAPS THE STATE RUNS AND ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT UTILIZE THE STATE LAB. AND THERE ARE. THE THE MAJORITY OF AGENCIES IN THE STATE USE THE STATE LAB HOWEVER SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT DON'T USE THE STATE LAB ARE VERY VERY LARGE. SO IN TERMS OF. WHETHER HOW REPRESENTATIVE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A BACKLOG. FROM THE STATE LABS. STILL IS. GIVES ITS ITS. VERY GOOD TO NO AND VERY GOOD THAT IT HAS NO BACKLOG IT JUST DOESN'T NECESSARILY INFORM US FULLY OF WHAT THE BACK LIKE IT'S. NOW OBVIOUSLY AS ELLIE ó SAID. IF WE. GO WITH THE SIMILES ACTION AND DO THE AUDIT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. HOWEVER. BECAUSE OF THE ATTENTION ON THIS ISSUE AND BECAUSE OF PAST FEDERAL FUNDS. THERE IS INDICATION THAT THE BACKLOG HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED AND THAT THE ALLOCATION THAT THE SENATE IS RECOMMENDING WOULD. IT WE CAN'T GUARANTEE NOT KNOWING THE EXACT NUMBER THAT IT WOULD. CLEAR UP ANY AGENCIES BUT GIVEN THAT IT REQUIRES THE WAY WE STRUCTURED IT A MATCH FROM THE AGENCY. IS UNLIKELY TO DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF ELIMINATING ORDER A HUGELY REDUCING THE BACKLOG JUST BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY KNOW. THAT EVERY AGENCY THAT RELIES ON THE STATE LAB NO LONGER HOUSE WHEN. THEY KEEP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE ROAD THANK MISTER CHAIR I QUESTION FOR THE LA ALSO MY NOTES SAY THAT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. SUPPORTS ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS SO WE TALKING WHEN IT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION ARE WE TESTING THEM OR WE JUST COUNTING THEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS ACCOUNT SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF KIDS THAT ARE. THAT. ARE PROCESSED EVIDENCE THAT IS OUT THERE. THERE WAS A STATE LAW THAT WAS ENACTED ON IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ANY EVIDENCE COLLECTED AT THAT POINT. WE NOW HAVE IN THE SYSTEM IT'S GOING TO BE REPORTED BUT PRIOR TO THAT WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS OUTSTANDING AND HAS BEEN ON PROCESS AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS TO GET A GOOD IDEA WHAT'S OUT THERE. KIND OF ELIMINATE THAT. WELL I'M INTERESTED IN NOT JUST COUNTING THEM BUT TESTING THEM SO WHY WOULD YOU NOT RECOMMEND THE SENATE VERSION OVER THE ASSEMBLY VERSION IN THAT CASE. I MEAN I I THINK FOR OUR PERSPECTIVE IT IS THIS ISSUE OF WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IS OUT THERE AND SO ON THE ASSEMBLY VERSION IN CONDUCTING THAT COUNTY WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH THAT INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW LARGE. THE BACKLOG IS. ELIMINATED AND WHAT FUNDING WOULD BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO AVOID A BACKLOG ENTIRELY. AND SO WE THINK THAT PROVIDES MAKE THAT DECISION OKAY WELL BEEN. IN MOST CASES I'M A FAN OF BEING DELIVERED TO BUT. IN THIS CASE THIS IS AN ISSUE WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR YEARS NOW AND I JUST WANT TO SEE THOSE THOSE UNTESTED KIDS GET TESTED AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SIX ABOUT SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL PROVIDES AYE IS STILL PROBABLY GOING TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO TESTALL OF THE UNTESTED KITS THAT ARE OUT THERE EVEN IF THEY ARE GREATLY REDUCED AS YOU SAY SO. OF THAT PIE I THINK I'M IN FAVOR OF HAVE A FAVOR THE SENATE VERSION. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO TO ISSUE FIVE JANITORIAL SERVICES. HELLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JONATHAN PETERSON WITH THE LA THOUGH. ITEM FIVE IN YOUR AGENDA REGARDS THE JANITORIAL SERVICES CONTRACT AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FISKE CORRECTION HEALTHCARE FACILITY WHICH IS LOCATED IN STOCKTON. JANITORIAL SERVICES FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AT THE OTHER PRISONS ARE OPERATED THROUGH A CONTRACT WITH THE CALIFORNIA PRISON INDUSTRIES AUTHORITY DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY AND SIZE OF THIS FACILITY. THAT I WAS NOT THAT OPTION WAS NOT AVAILABLE SO THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED A CONTRACT WITH PRIDE INDUSTRIES WHICH IS A NONPROFIT COMPANY. THAT A CLEANS VARIOUS FACILITIES INCLUDING THE SACRAMENTO AIRPORT TO CLEAN THESE FACILITIES THE COSTS THAT CONTRACT RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND AND AND THIS AND THREE POINT SIX MILLION IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN ON GOING. IN ORDER TO TRANSITION FROM THE CONTRACT WITH PRIDE INDUSTRIES TO A CIVIL SERVICE JANITORIAL STAFF. THE REASON THIS WAS NECESSARY WAS BECAUSE THE CURRENT CONTRACT ACCORDING THE MINISTRATION THE CURRENT CONTRACT VIOLATE CIVIL SERVICE RULES ABOUT. ON HAVING CONTRACTING STAFF DOING JOBS THAT CIVIL SERVICE IS AVAILABLE TO DO. THE SENATE REJECTED THE PROPOSAL BUT APPROVED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY ON THE TRANSITION FROM PRIDE TO CIVIL SERVICE STAFFED. THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE PROPOSAL AND ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO ASSIST. THE TRENDS THAT THE TRANSITION OF IT PRIDE EMPLOYEES INTO THE STATE'S CIVIL SERVICE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT BOTH HOUSES TOOK SIMILAR ACTIONS TO REJECT THE PERP THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION AND ADOPT LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CONTRACT ISSUE. WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY AVERSION BECAUSE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SEEMS LIKE A MORE APPROPRIATE VEHICLE TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION. I THINK IN THIS CONSTANT. THANK YOU THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD THIS PROPOSAL IN REACTION TO PENDING LITIGATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION ACKNOWLEDGES THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND AS SUCH WE ARE VERY OPEN TO ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THIS ISSUE IS. DEALT WITH PROPERLY WE HAVE OFFERED A COMPROMISE MY UNDERSTANDING TO SPLIT THE POSITIONS IS THAT LEDGE STAFF IS STILL REVIEWING THE COMPROMISE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OFFERED. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. WILL WE BE ABLE TO SEE THIS LANGUAGE. THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON THIS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS BE A SEPARATE VOTE ALSO AND CAN WE HAVE THAT LANGUAGE SO WE CAN REVIEW IT I DON'T WANT TO VOTE. BIGGER THE POPE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON. CAN WE HAVE THAT LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING. SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT LANGUAGE AND HAVE A SEPARATE VOTE ON THIS I WILL NOTE THAT THE. I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH PRIDE INDUSTRIES. AND THEIR SUCCESSES. NEVER ABILITIES. IS S. LITIGATION. PENDING OR THREATENED. THEY ARE NOT DOORS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LITIGATION IS THREATENED AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT I DO WE HOUSE US BOND TO A THREAT. WELL I THINK THAT THE RISK IS F. WE PROCEED WITHOUT. ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS THIS RISK IS OUT THERE WE COULD FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION IF WE WERE TO LOSE THAT LAWSUIT. I THINK THE OUTCOME WOULD BE MOORED DISAGREEABLE TO EVERYONE INVOLVED WE WOULD BASICALLY BE IN A SITUATION WHERE. WE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY. CLEANING THESE FACILITIES AND WE MAY RUN INTO ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL COURTS THEIR OVERSEEING. OUR MEDICAL. IN MAY MEDICAL PROGRAM SO THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THE OTHER ISSUE IS WE WOULD HAVE TO TERMINATE THAT CONTRAST. OUGHT RATHER ABRUPTLY AND I THINK IN THAT CASE. THE CAREFUL PLANNING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO TO MAKE SURE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE CAN BE TRANSITIONED INTO CIVIL SERVICE WOULD SUDDENLY. GO OUT THE WINDOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT REALLY QUICKLY AND I THINK THE THE RISK OF DISPLACING WORKERS WOULD BE MUCH GREATER IN THAT SITUATION DO YOU NOT HAVE ATTORNEYS THAT WOULD BE CAPABLE CRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE HELP. IN LITIGATION PROVING. WHEREBY. THE STATE WOULD MORE LIKELY PREVAIL IN THE LAWSUIT. BUT WE HAVE ATTORNEYS CAPABLE OF DRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT YOU COULD PRESENT TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. OF THAT SORT. I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING INTO I THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT THE. ITS IS REALLY A CONSTITUTIONAL SHOW IN WITH AN ARTICLE SEVEN THERE ARE. THERE IS ESTABLISHED A MERIT BASED COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION PROCESS AND SO. THE STATE IS IS PRETTY LIMITED IN TERMS OF CONTRACTING OUT SO I I THINK THE THE CONTRACTS WITH IN STATE LAW THAT PARTIALLY OR. A SET BY THE CONSTITUTION ARE ARE PRETTY WOMAN. WELL I THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO PRESENT THESE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING. TO TO THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE SO WE CAN HAVE A CHOICE IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS THANK. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ANIMAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH CODE SECTION GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO OR ONE NINE FOUR ZERO FOUR. AT FAMILIAR WITH. ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO THE OTHER CUTS ACTION A LESS SO TOP MAN. SEEMS THAT. NINETEEN ONE THIRTY ALLOWS PRIDE INDUSTRIES TO HAVE THE CONTRACT SO I'M. OR IS THAT WHAT THE PUT THE LAWSUIT WOULD MIGHT BE ABOUT IS THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT PARTICULAR CODE SECTION. I THINK THE THAT INITIALLY THE CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO UNDER CLAUSE WITHIN GOVERNMENT COULD ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO WHICH ALLOWED FOR EMERGENCY CONTRACTS. THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE THE FEDERAL COURTS HAVE RAISED ISSUES WITH THE. JANITORIAL SERVICES THAT THE THESE FACILITY IN STOCKTON. THERE WAS. THAT THE RECEIVER LOOKED AT THE SITUATION IN TERMS OF HOW TO PROCEED IN THERE WAS DIFFICULTY. FINDING A CIVIL SERVICE SOLUTION IMMEDIATELY AND SO UNDER THOSE SERVE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS I WAS ABLE TO GO OUT AND IN CONTRACT OUT FOR THESE SERVICES BUT. I THINK THE EMERGENCY PERIOD MAY HAVE PASSED AT THIS POINT. OKAY SO. CIVIL SERVANTS WORK DOING THE JOB WELL FEDERAL RECEIVER SAID. FIX IT. STATE HIRES PRIDE. WELL I THINK THE THE ISSUE WASN'T SURE THAT CIVIL SERVICE WASN'T DOING A GOOD JOB THERE WERE ONLY AT THAT TIME SIXTY CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS AT THAT FACILITY. THAT FACILITY HAD HAD JUST BEEN OPEN THEY WERE STAFFING OPEN THE ISSUE WAS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO HIRE ENOUGH CIVIL SERVICE STAFF TO PROVIDE THE WHERE IT WASN'T. NECESSARILY AN ISSUE THAT THEY WEREN'T DOING IT ADEQUATELY. OKAY AND SO. THE FEDERAL RECEIVER'S DOWN TO WHAT IT'S NOW OF PRIDE IS THAT CORRECT. I NEED I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW MANY AUDITS THAT DONORS THAT I'M ARE. EVER I'VE LEARNED THAT THEY'VE DONE TO WATER RECEIVERS THAT TO WHAT IT GAVE THEM A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH SO. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE URGENCY AND THE NEED OF THE FEDERAL SIEVERS FINE WITH THIS ORGANIZATION. AND WE JUST HAD TO ITEMS READY WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTSOURCING TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHIRLING ON ITEM FIVE. YOU KNOW SO SO. WHAT'S. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE AND WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE OUTSOURCING. WHEN THAT'S AB AB THAT'S A MANAGEMENT DECISION THAT SHOULD BE. PURSUED BECAUSE OF COST REASONS ITS ARAB. I'D I'D LIKE SOME CLEAR JUST GOING BACK TO ISSUE TO ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S A MUCH DIFFERNT. RAM WE ARE THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S GOING OUT TO NON PROFITS. THIS IS WORK THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED IN A FACILITY AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE COMPARISON IS APPROPRIATE BETWEEN THE TWO ITEMS CLIMB I DISAGREE MISS COSTA BECAUSE WE'RE HIRING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. AND WE HAVE NOW SOMEONE WHO'S PROVIDING THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING FROM A COMPASSION STANDPOINT THIS IS. JUST A WONDERFUL THING TO DO. THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND AND FOR BABY A UNION TO START IMPOSING CERTAIN THINGS AND THREATENING CERTAIN THINGS. I I THINK NEED TO STAND UP TO THAT KIND OF STUFF. THANK YOU MISTER. THINK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS. IF NOT WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. ARMED IN PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM. LL. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IS ONLY PROVIDED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING INTO DOJ AND ALSO ADOPTED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. TO PROVIDE TWENTY SIX POSITIONS TO CONTINUE TO WORK DOWN THE ARMS AND PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM OR APPS. BACKLOG JUST A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT WE WANTED AYE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AS YOU DELIBERATE ON THIS ISSUE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR THEIR APPROXIMATE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE IN THE APPS DATABASE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED RESOURCES IN THE PAST TO TO WORK DOWN THIS BACKLOG. IT IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR TO US ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WOULD REDUCE THAT BACKLOG. AND WHAT LEVEL OF ONGOING RESOURCES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE BACKLOG. THANK YOU MISS COSTS. THIS IS AN ONGOING LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION THE MINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT IT THIS TIME. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS ONE THE DEPT ONLY NEEDS THE INDIVIDUAL SCRUTINY. THAT'S A LONG SUSTAINED ISSUE OF GREAT MAGNITUDE. THEY'RE NOW PURPORTED TO BE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. IN POSSESSION OF. UNAUTHORIZED WEAPONS. NO LEGALLY. AND. MANY IF NOT ALL MOST ARE NOT ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE MORE THAN ONE WEAPON. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND. DANGEROUS WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE THAT FOR YEARS THIS BACKLOG HAS LANGUISHED WELL WE. THE LEGEND SAYS A BUDGET COMMITTEE IS THROWING MONEY. TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. DIDN'T TO MAKE. FAR FROM SATISFACTORY. PROGRESS. ONE OF THE RATIONALES WERE THAT BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CANNOT. PAY THE SALARIES. COMPARABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO THIS FOR THE MONEY THAT THE STATE HAS GIVEN THEM WE HAVE ACTUALLY I UNDERSTAND THEY RETURNED. SOME MONEY. THIS YEAR. AND IN A MEETING AT A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING I FELT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HE COMMITTED TO ME TO COME TO US WITH A PLAN. OF HOW THEY WILL UTILIZE WHATEVER RESOURCES WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM. AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED THEM. HOW WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO BOOK WORK DOWN THAT? BACK WHILE. AND I ASSUMED IT WOULD INCLUDE. HOW THEY WOULD SECURE THE INDIVIDUALS TO DO THIS? SO FAR I IT WOULDN'T THEY HAVE NOT PRESENTED THAT INFORMATION TO US SO IT'S CERTAINLY PREMATURE. THAT TO MOVE AHEAD YOU'VE GIVEN THE MANY MORE MONEY. AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE NEXT WEEK AS WELL AS IT IS THIS WEEK. SO WHY DO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO TALK A LOT ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S A PERSISTENT AND PERVASIVE PROBLEM OF GREAT SIGNIFICANT. PUBLIC IMPORT. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DRAMA IN. SAD DRAMA IN IN SACRAMENTO THIS SPRING. AND SO I'M. TRYING TO KIND OF LOOK AT. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF CURRENT EVENTS AND. AND SO HERE IN JUST IN THE FIRST FEW ITEMS WE HAVE A REQUEST. TO LOOK AT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS. BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE A. AND ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT'S GOT TEN THOUSAND GUN STILL OUT THERE. AND IN I WONDER AYE AYE WHEN I WAS MANAGING MANY I'D YOU'D WOULD DO CORRELATIONS AND I WONDER IF THERE'S A CORRELATION. BETWEEN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS AND THE AMOUNT OF GUNS THAT ARE OUT THERE I'D BE REAL NERVOUS OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER. KNOWING THAT. THIS INVENTORY IS OUT THERE HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED IN THIS ISSUE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME BUT I'D I'D LIKE THAT. MAYBE IF IT'S POSSIBLE HAVE SOME KIND OF CORRELATION SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE THE SAME DEPARTMENT IS INVOLVED ON BOTH ENDS OF THIS TOPIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THEY JUST THIRD THESE ITEMS WERE. A LUMP TOGETHER BECAUSE THEY CAME TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET SUB FIVE DEATHS Y.. WERE DISCUSSING THEM IN THIS ORDER. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE HIS SOON. REFERENCE TO PLAN TO UTILIZE THE RESOURCES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUT I I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND I. THIS IS JUST A QUICK COMMENT NOT TO BELABOR THIS I DO THINK WE NEED THEM. SEE A PLAN. THAT INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE DOJ PERSONNEL BUT LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COURT SYSTEM. A A PLAN THAT. WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THIS VERY VERY VERY COMPLICATED ISSUES SO FAR. OF THE DOJ IS LISTENING WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT. THE DEPARTMENT SUPPLY BUT BOTH THE OF THE. BUDGET COMMITTEES OF THE OF THIS LEGISLATURE. A WITH A PLAN THAT NOT ONLY TALKS ABOUT THE USE OF THE STAFFING THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT APPROVE IT'S BEEN. PROPOSED BY THE ASSEMBLY BUT. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COURT SYSTEM TO TRY TO. OF SECURE THESE THEM. THESE WEAPONS. AND AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE AND WE SEEM TO BE DOING TODAY SO. WITHOUT TO MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU ON MISTER CHAIR I I JUST I I HEARD YOUR RESPONSE. TO MY COLLEAGUE AND I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT I INTERPRET HIS QUESTION THE SAME WAY YOU DID HOW MY HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEY WERE GROUPED IN THIS. WAY BUT BUT WHEN MY COLLEAGUE USE THE TERM CORRELATION. IT SEEMS TO ME AS WELL AS THE REFERENCE TO LOCAL EVENTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU MEAN ABOUT. CORRELATION I APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT. THE FEAR HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE TEN THOUSAND FIREARMS BUT. YOU TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL EVENTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO I THINK THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE GUNNED DOWN BY POLICE WHO WERE FOUND TO BE UNARMED. SO I WOULD JUST BE SUGGEST WE ALL BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE LANGUAGE WE USE. AND PERHAPS TO SEE THESE TWO ISSUE ITEMS. SEPARATE AS THEY WERE PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA. VINCENT ABOUT THROUGH CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION. MY CONCERN IS. THINKING THAT IF I DON'T KNOW IF A PERSON IS ARMED. I'M THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE A. COMPONENT OF WHAT'S GOING ON BECAUSE I ONCE I WANT THIS TO STOP. BUT IT DOESN'T HELP IF POLICE OFFICERS KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNS OUT THERE THAT SHOULDN'T BE OUT THERE. AND AND I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. AND IT JUST SEEMS THAT THAT THAT THE INVENTORY IS NOT MOVING DOWN. PASSING OF CYPRESS SHAPE. SENATOR ROSS RECOMMENDATION OF A PLAN. BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT THINGS MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S ADDING TO OUR MUTUAL FRUSTRATION. AND THAT'S WHY ARE OUR GAS FOR THE CORRELATION I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE. A VARIETY OF ISSUES PERHAPS THAT BUTTON THAT NEITHER YOU OR I ARE COMPLETELY VERSED IN. ON THAT THAT. ARE ATTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASED INCIDENCE OF. OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS VERTICALLY OF THOSE ON A VICTIMS WHO ARE UNARMED SO I WOULD JUST BE CAREFUL AS WE TRY TO DRAW CORRELATION THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION. AND BECAUSE A LOT SAY BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE. IF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS OF THIS. PHENOMENON THAT WERE SEEN THAT SHOULD BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. OKAY MOVING TO ISSUE SEVEN. MOBILE SOURCE EXPANSION TO OFF ROAD AN AFTERMARKET PARTS. LL FEEL FREE TO BEGIN AT YOUR LEISURE. PROPS BROWN WITH THE LA HELLO SO ISSUE SEVEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO AUTHORIZE THE A ARP TO IMPOSE FEES ON APPLICANTS. SEEKING CERTIFICATION OF AFTERMARKET PARTS AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. AND THE LANGUAGE DIRECTED A ARE BE TO CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FACTORS WHEN SETTING THE FEE. INCLUDING. THE IMPACT OF THE FEE ON THE MARKET. THE SENATE'S DID NOT TAKE ACTION ON THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE LANGUAGE AND ADDED. AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT A ARE BE IS TO CONSIDER. WHICH IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO NOT IN ENACTING A FEE OR A FEW THE DOES NOT COME FULLY COVER THEIR APARTMENTS COSTS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ON THIS ISSUE WE DON'T HAVE ANY. ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE ADDITIONAL FACTOR TO CONSIDER THAT THE ASSEMBLY ADDED. THIS COST. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. WE THINK THAT THE LANGUAGE OFFERED BY THE ASSEMBLY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTACT FOR FEES TO FULLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THANK YOU. A SERIOUS. AS CHAIRMAN WE NEED THE HAVE A SEPARATE DISCUSSION ON THIS TO AN END TO MAJOR POLICY ISSUE HERE. THAT INVOLVES. THESE. A. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE WATCHED INCREMENTAL YEAR AFTER YEAR. THIS LEGISLATURE SEED IT'S AUTHORITY THE MEMBERS AUTHORITY OR THE AUTHORITY THE PEOPLE THAT ELECTED. THE LEGISLATORS. TO THE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT. IN THIS CASE TO IMPOSE FEES. REYES THOSE FEES. AND BROUGHT AND THE APPLICATION OF THOSE FEES ON THEIR OWN VOLITION. THAT SHOULD NOT BE THEIR PURVIEW SHOULD BE OF THE LEGISLATURE. THEN THIS IS ANOTHER STEP DOWN THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE. WE SHOULD NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS UNLESS WE HAVE IN. THE BILL. THE ACTUAL FEET THAT WILL BE IMPOSED. AND WHAT IT WILL BE APPLIED THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO REST THE THORNY THE PEOPLE BACK INTO. THEIR HANDS. NOT BE CONTINUING LATE GIVING IT TO THESE AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT. WITH IMPUNITY. THROUGH REGULATION ALONE. THEN SOMETIMES I ARGUE JUST TO. D. O. M. OPERATION MANUAL. OR MEMO. REYES FEAST IMPOSE FEES BROAD APPLICATION OF THESE WE NEED A DEEP DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO TO ISSUE DATE BRIDGE POINT BRIDGE. WELL. I'D THIS PROPOSAL IS FOR A TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR BOND FUNDS AND. FOR THE BRIDGEPORT BRIDGE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED US SENATE DID NOT TAKEN ACTION THERE WAS NO GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT THIS WOULD BE AN AUGMENTATION TO USE ON PASSED APPROPRIATIONS FOR THIS PROJECT. AND THAT'S THROUGH THE FACT THAT. HOW TO THE BIDDING PROCESS THE? LOWEST BID WAS TO PRINT MILLION HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT OF AB INAPPROPRIATE AND. THEY CAN. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTION ON THIS ITEM WE BELIEVE THAT. PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR BOND FUNDS OR THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE AND FOR UTILIZED FOR PREVIOUS AYE PORTIONS OF THIS PROJECT THANK YOU. SERIOUS. BUT ON THAT POINT. IF WE WAIT. TO PROP SIXTY EIGHT. THAT WILL DELAY THINGS SUBSTANTIALLY. FOR THIS PROJECT. GIVE ME AGAIN THE REAL HARD REASON WHY EIGHTY FOUR WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE IS THERE STILL STE LOVE SOME OF THE EIGHTY FOUR BOND UNSPENT AT THIS POINT. THAT'S CORRECT THERE ARE STILL BOUNCES AND PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOREIGN WE BELIEVE IT TO BE APPROPRIATE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS PROJECT. OKAY. WELL. I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE COULDN'T UTILIZE MORE READILY A MORE EXPEDIENT LEAVE THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS WHITE Y. NOT. PART SIXTY EIGHT WAS JUST PASSED YESTERDAY ON AND AS SUCH THEY'LL BE SOME ADMINISTERING. THE PEOPLE DELIVERY REQUIRED EIGHTY FOUR WE ALREADY HAVE IN POSSESSION OKAY WHAT YOU MADE MY POINT I GUESS I MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO I WAS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY SHOULD BE. FUNDED FROM THE PRIOR BOND NOT FROM SIXTY EIGHT. THAT JUST PASSED I BELIEVE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TYPO ON THE AGENDA ITEM I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS RECTIFIED THAT WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR IS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDS SOURCE. THANK YOU THAT TEARS UP THE DISCREPANCIES. THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE. INVASIVE PESTS AND WEEDS. NO WAY OUT. SHOP MIGHT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE AGRICULTURAL FUND. FOR TAT. IT FOR ASIANS IF YOU SELL IT AND ONE LONG BEING SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND IN ONE TIME I BASIS FOR ASIAN CITRUS SELIGMAN Y. LONG BEING SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES. BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE APPROVED FIVE BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION OF THE SHOT HOLE BORER BEETLE. IN ADDITION THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. AND FINALLY THAT ASSEMBLY APPROVE NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS STATEWIDE INVASIVE SPECIES ISSUES. I'M WE RECOMMEND ON THAT GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ASIANS AT YOUR SON IN LAW ONLINE PING SUPPRESSION ACTIVITIES TO RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY ACTION. GIVEN THE RECENT BRAD I'VE AGENCIES FACILITY IN A LONG LONG BANG WE THINK THE RESOURCES ARE JUSTIFIED. I REGARDING THAT SECOND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REGARDING FUNDING FOR SUPPRESSION AND SAW A SHOT HOLE BORDER BEETLE. RECOMMEND THE SENATE BELIEVE IN THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THESE FUNDS. AND FINALLY REGARDING THAT ASSEMBLY THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS STATEWIDE INVASIVE SPECIES ISSUES. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO EMPLOYMENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY BY GRAYSON. WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE INVASIVE SPECIES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA TELL COORDINATED THE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO PREVENT THE INTRODUCTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES. INTO A CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE THAT THIS CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WAY WISH TO CONSIDER WHAT IT WANTS TO TO WAIT TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES AND TELL. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN FORTY HAS WORKED ITS WAY THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS. THANK YOU. WAS COST. BOTH PACKAGES INCLUDE GENERAL FUND LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT THIS TYPE. THANK YOU. SENATE NIELSEN. HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE. MED FLY YEARS. INVASIVE SPECIES ARE ALWAYS. A BIG THREAT AND THEY NEED TO BE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. THE LEGISLATION PROPOSED. IT IT MAY HAVE MERIT. BUT AT THAT WE I DON'T THINK WE DARE WAIT FOR THE PASSAGE OF THAT LEGISLATION. IN FACT IF IT'S CRITICAL ENOUGH WE COULD INCORPORATED INTO. ONE OF OUR MANY TRAILER BILLS THAT ARE SO FLEXIBLE BUT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD APPRECIATE CONSIDERATION SHEPPARTON INDEPENDENT WHEN WE GET TO IT. THANK YOU SAID IRAQ. THANK YOU AS CHAIR I WOULD ONLY NOTE THAT THE. DEVASTATION. THAT FLORIDA HAS EXPERIENCED WITH IT THIS ASIAN CITRUS SILOED. HAS LEVELED THAT CITRUS ECONOMY AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. IN THIS STATE LAST YEAR I GAVE A SPEECH I WON'T REPEAT IT AGAIN BUT. MS CUTS TO CERTAINLY HEARD THAT. AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY. PRE RESPONSIVE AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT. A IT IS A IT'S A DEVASTATING DISEASE OF THE MONEY IS NOT USED BY THE COMMERCIAL GROWERS THEY TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN. OPERATIONS IT IS UTILIZED TO GOING TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE GROWN FOND OF HAVING CITRUS TREES IN OUR BACKYARD. BUT TO PROVIDE A PREVENTATIVE EFFORTS WITH RESPECT THOSE IN A BACKYARD TREES. BECAUSE ONCE THE INFESTATION STARTS IN THOSE TREES IT SPREADS VERY RAPIDLY IN THE FEAR IS. THAT IF IT'S SPREAD AS WIDE ENOUGH AND FAR ENOUGH. THE. HERCULEAN EFFORTS OF THE GROWERS IN THE COMMERCIAL GROVES WERE NOT BE ENOUGH TO STOP. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO PERSONALLY. A TEN MILLION PLUS FIVE WORKS FOR ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SETTING UP THE. THE YOUNG. COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION I'LL LEAVE THAT TO OTHERS BUT I CERTAINLY SUPPORT TO. OF THE ASSEMBLIES PROPOSAL IN THIS REGARD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU. LOOK I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ISSUE WAS HEARD AND UP A SUBCOMMITTEE THREE. ADAM AND AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE FUNDING CA FOR THE CITRIX CECIL ADAMS LONG LONG BIG. IS SUPPORTED BY THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY WHO PUTS IN AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF MONEY TO MATCH THE FUNDS. ABSOLUTE WAS ACTUALLY REQUEST THAT CAME FROM BAG AND I THINK THAT. A GIVEN THAT TO ASSEMBLY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. GREAT THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS I ISSUE TED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON CAL EXPO. LL. THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AT CAL EXPO. I JUST TO PROVIDE YOU SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION. A PROPOSITION SIXTY IT PROVIDES EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DIVISION AFFAIRS NEXT POSITIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IF IT AGRICULTURE TO PROVIDE FOR FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS FOR COUNTY FAIRS. I AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA EXPOSITION IN STATE FAIR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS IS APPROVED BY BOTH HOUSES FOR THESE PURPOSES. BOND CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. INC PREPARED A URGENT FRIEDMAN IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR CALIFORNIA FAIRGROUNDS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THAT I TALKED TO THEM THEY SAID IT'S OUT OF DATE HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THAT THAT STUDY ACCORDING TO CDFA THAT CALLASPO WAS FOUR POINT SEVEN PERCENT OR FIFTEEN MILLION OF THE TOTAL STATEWIDE NEED A THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AT THAT TIME. ACCORDING TO CDF A. FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AFFAIRS THAT I SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE BASED ON THE NEEDS OF. AFFAIRS STATEWIDE TO THE LIKE TO DO A STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COMPREHENSIVE STUDY SHOULD BE COMPLETED THAT A PRIOR TO YOU I'M FUNDING SPECIFIC FAIRS SO WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR CDF A TO COMPLETE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STUDY. OF AYE THERE ARE ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR I BELIEVE YEAH SEVENTY FOUR FAIR GROUND STATEWIDE. DO AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE NEEDS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BEFORE AIR MARKING TEN MILLION OUT OF THESE EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS FOR CALYX. THANK YOU. SIMILAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. SORT OF PREFER THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH. CALYX BOAT IT. THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIR IS DOES REAL WELL EVERY YEAR IT GENERATES MORE REVENUE THAN IT. HASN'T EXPENDITURES BUT CALLASPO THAT ISN'T THE CASE ARE JUST BARELY BREAKING EVEN. BECAUSE. ALTHOUGH THERE IN THE PENALTY MANAGED TO STILL GET TO ENJOY. CONTRACT CENTER GENERATED BY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT COMES TO THE M. A USE FOR EMPLOYEE. I COSTS SO THEY'RE SEEING. THE SAME ISSUES THAT OUR SCHOOLS. AND OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE SEEING. SO. THERE'S. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A BUDGET THAT SO TIGHT OBVIOUSLY THE MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTY. DECLINES AS YOU PAY MORE FOR PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND. RETIREE MEDICAL SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THIS ASSET A LITTLE. MORE CAREFULLY. I END WE SHOULD I GIVE IT A HIGHER PRIORITY. SO WITH THAT I I WOULD PROBABLY SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY RECOMMENDATION. GREAT THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE. THE PROP SIXTY AND BOND MONIES WERE PROMISED. TWO ALL FARES AVAILABLE TO ALL. THE AGRICULTURE DISTRICT FAIRS. AND THOUGH I. LOVE CAL EXPO AND WORKED VERY HARD MANY YEARS AGO TO SAVE CAL EXPO. I THINK IT'S BLOWN TOWARD TO. ACCOMMODATE THEM WITH THIS MUCH MONEY. ALL FARES HAVE TREMENDOUS THIRD. MAINTENANCE EXPENSES. AND I THINK ALL DESERVE. AN OPPORTUNITY AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. FOR THESE MONIES. I'M RESISTANT TO GIVING THAT MUCH. THE CAL EXPO UNLESS THEY WANT TO MAKE THAT DISTRICT LEE OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND IN ADDITION TO. AND A SIXTY EIGHT BOND MONIES THAT WERE PROMISED TO ALL. SUCH FAIRS. HIS SHOE ELEVEN LIVE BROADCAST TO FISHING GAME COMMISSION BOARD MEETINGS. NO WAY OUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LA NO THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE LIVE WEBCAST A FISH AND GAME COMMISSION COMMITTEE MEETINGS. THE COMMISSION ALREADY CA CONTAINS AND AND PROVIDES A WEBCAST OF ITS BOARD MEETINGS SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO REQUIRE THAT IT WEB CAST THE ROUGHLY TEN A YEAR. COMMITTEE MEETINGS OF IT SUB. SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAPPEN AROUND THE STATE AYE LARGELY TO SOLICIT PUBLIC INPUT. I'M JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT THIS IS SIMILAR TO ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ASSESSMENT OF THE COST OF THAT PROPOSAL WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THANK YOU MISS COST. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION OF THE ANALYSTS HAS NOTED THE PROVISIONS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH THE GOVERNOR VETOED LA FROM. THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS. OKAY. ISSUE TWELVE LOCAL CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS GRANTS. ELIOT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND FOR LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS. AND. WE JUST THEATER SAYS AS ADAM IF THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY. FOR SPENDING GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU DISCUSSED. THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY ISSUE THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL HABITAT PROGRAM WHERE. THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL HABITAT PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES PAYMENTS TO LANDOWNERS TO CREATE WETLANDS AND PROVIDE ABOUT WEAPONS AND BIRD HABITAT ON THEIR PROPERTIES. AB JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT WHICH PASSED YESTERDAY INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM. NONE OF THAT FUNDING WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO GO OUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT THAT IS ANOTHER FUND SOURCE YOU CONSIDER. FOR FUNDING THIS PROGRAM IF THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES. THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IN THE. SENATE NIELSEN DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN TOO. GET KICKED IN LIGHT OF THE POP SIXTY POSSIBILITY MISTER CHAIRMAN. OKAY. ISSUE FOURTEEN FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE ALEJO. I THINK YOU THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE THE STATE SHARE. REQUIRED TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SIX SPECIFIC LARGE URBAN FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THE SENATE APPROVED DOES PROPOSE THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED BUT SET ASIDE TEN MILLION OF THAT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOR ONE PARTICULAR WRECK THAT RECLAMATION DISTRICT AND REPAIRS TO LEVEES IN THAT AREA. SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR YOU HERE IF YOU DO STE BOUT SET ASIDE TEN MILLION OUT OF THAT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY IT MAY BE HARD TO DRAW DOWN THE FULL AMOUNT. OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED PROJECTS AND. ALL RECLAMATION DISTRICTS CAN APPLY FOR FUNDING FOR FLOOD CONTROL GRANT PROGRAMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT RUNS. THANK YOU DISCUSSED. THANK YOU AS THE ANALYST NOTES OUT WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION ON THIS THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE DOESN'T FIT THE BROADER PHILOSOPHY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD WE PUT TOGETHER OUR FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WHICH WAS. THAT PROJECTS WOULD LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS PROJECTS WOULD REDUCE LIABILITY AND THAT PROJECTS WOULD PROTECT. KEY INFRASTRUCTURE AND LIVES. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS SIR. WELL EXPENDITURES VIOLATIVE OF HOW WE'VE HISTORICALLY FUNDED RECLAMATION DISTRICTS. AND I THINK TOO LITTLE ON TOWARD TO DIRECT THIS MUCH AT ONE PARTICULAR RECLAMATION DISTRICT. WHO WHO WISH PROJECT IS NOT EVEN BEEN A PART? OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION BOARDS OVERALL PLAN WHICH IS A VERY VERY EXHAUSTIVELY DEFINED PLAN OF HOW ALL OF THESE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS FIT TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO PLAN YOU JUST DON'T DO THESE THINGS PIECEMEAL AS THIS PROPOSAL. PROPOSES TO DO. THANK YOU. PACKED COMMITTEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY. SEEING NONE ISSUE FIFTEEN GOGGLE CULTURAL DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADES. WELL. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THIRTY MILLION ONETIME GENERAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENTS AND UPGRADES BOTH HOUSES. ADOPTED THE PROPOSED FUNDING I JUST WANT TO NOTE ONE SMALL. MISTAKE THERE IS A MINOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE FUNDS TO GO TO LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS FOR DIESEL RISK REDUCTION AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH PROPOSED LANGUAGE. THANK YOU MISS COST. WE SUPPORT EITHER HOUSES ACTION ON THIS ITEM WE HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY PIECE AND ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. BECAUSE BUDGET YOUR CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES ARE SLIGHTLY. LOWER THAN THE CURRENT YEAR ON USING GENERAL FUND AND GIGI ARE A FUNDS MAKE THAT MAKES THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM HOLE BASED ON THE NUMBER WE UTILIZED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THANK YOU. SENATE NIELSEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD ASK THE LA. AND. DIRECTOR ACOSTA TO COME AT. I'M GENERALLY THE GUY THAT WANTS TO PUT EVERYTHING OUT TO THE LOCALS AND DIRECTING THIS. STRAIGHT TO THE A PC DO YOU USE ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS. THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS NOW WILL BE TAKEN OFF THE TOP DIMINISHING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE. OF FOR THESE PURPOSES. WHY COULDN'T WE JUST CONTINUE TO DO WITH THE WAY WE'VE BEEN DOING IT INSTEAD OF DIRECTING IT STRAIGHT TO THEM AND ENCOURAGE AN ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE? OPERATION COSTS THAT DIMINISHES THE IMPACT OF THOSE FUNDS I MEAN IS THAT. CURRENTLY THE WHAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THE FUNDS ARE ALSO GIVEN TO THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND SO THIS A PROPOSAL WOULD CONTINUE THAT CURRENT STRUCTURE. IF I MAY THE LANGUAGE CONFORMS TO CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH IS THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. THANK YOU FOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTEEN BE SAFE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED AT ONE POINT NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TO DEVELOP TO BE SAFE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTIES TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS ON HIVE REGISTRATION OTHER LAWS TO PREVENT APIARY STAFFS. AND THREE INTERN FIFTY THREE THOUSAND FOR THAT APARTMENT FOOD AGRICULTURE TO ABIDE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO COUNTIES. AND STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. BUT THAT ASSEMBLY APPROVE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS BUDGETED THE SENATE APPROVED THE LA A RECOMMENDATION. THAT IS TO A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS FOR THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND FOR TO POSITIONS TO ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM. AND ALSO APPROVED THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. ON A ONE TIME BASIS. AND ADOPTED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING CFA TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE REGARDING FUNDING NEEDS. AND THE FUND WOULD REQUIRE I'VE THAT REPORTING LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO PREPARING POOR ON HOW THIS PROGRAM COULD BE. FUNDED USING FEES ON. THAT THAT PEOPLE THAT MANAGE THE APRS. NOW PUT THAT ON THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THIS IS APPROPRIATE TO BE FUNDED WITH THE GENERAL FUND OR WITH FEES. AND ARE ON THE ONE HAND IT IS APPROPRIATE TO FIND IT WITH GENERAL FUND BECAUSE THERE'S A BROAD BENEFIT TO SOCIETY FROM THESE BEES POLLINATING. NOT ONLY COMMERCIAL CROPS BUT ALSO. PLANTS IN PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS AND GARDENS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THAT. MANAGE THE HIVES OUR COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE SO THERE'S SORT OF A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PROGRAM WE FIND WITH FEES AND GENERAL FUND OR A MIXTURE OF BOTH. WE THOUGHT IT MADE SENSE TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE COME BACK ANY YEAR AND TELL US WHETHER IT'S FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT. A FEE FUNDED PROGRAM. WHEN THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER IT SHOULD BE FEE FUNDED OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE MEXICO GENERAL FUND AND FEES. THANK YOU MISS COST THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A CONFERENCE COMPROMISE WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS THAT COMPROMISE WOULD APPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S UP PROPOSAL BUT ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS INCOMPLETE THE PROPOSED REPORT BY JANUARY TEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH WOULD INFORM AYE FUTURE PROPOSALS FOR ON GOING RESOURCES. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT. CONSTRUCTIVE THOUGHT A NEW PROPOSAL WE NEED TO EXAMINE IT BUT DIED LIKE TO SET THIS ONE ASIDE FOR FUTURE DISCUSSION WHEN WE GET TO THE TIME. VOTING. THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MOVING ON TO ISSUE SEVENTEEN AGRICULTURAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS. ALEJO. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED THE PROPOSED FUNDING THE SENATE REJECTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AYE WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE ACTION OUT THERE ARE CURRENTLY CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THESE ACTIVITIES IN BOTH HOUSES BUDGETS. ADOPTS THIRTY FOUR MILLION IN CAP AND TRADE FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT. THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS IMPLEMENTING AND THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEY'RE NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR FIRST AWARD IN OF THE FUNDS UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR AND SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO LET THE PROGRAM ROLLOUT. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EXPECTED BENEFITS ARE BEFORE ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. ACOSTA. THANK YOU WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY VERSION SOMEWHERE THE PREVIOUS ITEM ON AGRICULTURALLY HAD DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT WE HAVE TO SINCE THE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. ONE IN THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN THE OTHER IN THE GENERAL FUND SIDE AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE FACT THAT OUR BUDGET YEAR I CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES ARE SLIGHTLY LAST. IF COMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE COMMENSURATE AMOUNT WITHIN THE GENERAL FUND. THANK YOU AND YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN ISSUE FIFTEEN CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IF WE COULD MAKE THIS OTHER SET ASIDE TO MANAGER. SENATOR NIELSEN JUST IN TERMS OF PROCESS. IS IT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT WERE ONLY SAID IN THE SIDE THE ONES. YOU IDENTIFIED OR ALL OF THE AGENDA ITEMS TODAY THAT. MEMBERS OF YOUR CAUCUS AFTER THE ENGINE DIES THE MEN CHAIR I IT I WOULD ARGUE ANYONE ANY MEMBER OF THE. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BRINGS UP I AM. B. AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ONES THAT I BRING UP. THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT I'M ASKING FOR THAT CONSIDERATION PERFECT THANK YOU SIR. SENATOR MOORE LA REID LOOKING AT. USING SOMETHING THAT SUMMER TO A CONSENT CALENDAR. ARE I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE CHAIR TO COME BACK AND POSE THAT QUESTION TO HIM PROBLEMS AND HOW HE INTENDS TO MANITOBA HAVE SUCH HIGH REGARD FOR YOU I. THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD JUST. HAVE BEEN AND TAKE CARE OF IT WHILE WE WERE HERE I THINK. MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE VERY WELCOME SIR. THAT MEANS YOU REALLY ENJOYED LAST YEAR I SURE. I THINK EVERYBODY WE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE ITEM. GREAT ISSUE EIGHTEEN AB ONE NINETY FIVE SUSPENSION. BUT NICK SCHROEDER WITH THE LA OH. THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT INCLUDED IN OUT BY THE SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR. AND THE TBL WOULD SUSPEND AB ONE NINETY FIVE FOR TWO YEARS AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND. REQUIRE SPECIFIC INFORMATION INCLUDED. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT UP BALLOT MEASURES. ACOSTA. THINKING WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION WE UNDERSTAND I'M AT THE HOUSE NOTED THAT GOVERNOR SIGNED AB ONE NINETY FIVE INTO LAW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A POLICY BILL ON THIS ISSUE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THIS DISCUSSION. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE. SO ARE AB ONE NIGHT IF I WAS MY BILL OBVIOUSLY I HAVE. SOME. STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THIS I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE LET EVERYONE KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE SO A THREE YEARS AGO I AUTHORED. LEGISLATION AB EIGHT OR NINE THAT IMPOSE A REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSPARENCY IN BALLOT LABELING FOR TAX INCREASES AND WHAT IT DID IS REQUIRE. THAT OF A TAX INCREASE APPEARS ON A BALLOT FOR VOTER APPROVAL YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY STATE THAT IS A TAX INCREASE WE HAVE TO STATE THE RATE OF THE TAX AT THE RATIO OF THE TAXES IS AUTHORIZED. I HAVE TO BE RIGHT THERE ON THE BALLOT LABEL NOT BURIED IN THE VOTER INFORMATION PAMPHLET SO THAT PASSED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT. AND EVERY YEAR SINCE THEN I'VE AUTHORED CLEAN UP LEGISLATION THAT FIXES LITTLE IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS THAT HAVE ARISEN. SO LAST YEAR TO CLEAN UP BILL WAS AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND AMONG OTHER THINGS IT ANSWERED THE QUESTION OF IF A BALLOT IF A BOND MEASURE. APPEARS ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER APPROVAL IS THAT BOND MEASURE ALSO SUBJECT TO THOSE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS AND AB ONE NINETY FIVE SAID YES. IF IT RAISES PROPERTY TAXES YOU DO HAVE TO MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES. THAT WAS VERY UNCONTROVERSIAL THE BILL HAD NO OPPOSITION I DON'T THINK I GOT A SINGLE NO VOTE IN EITHER CHAMBER IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT SO. SINCE THEN A COUPLE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LETTER THAT I'M SURE EVERYONE'S RECEIVED. HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WORDING OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE WORK ARE VERY VALID THERE ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RATE OF THE BOND IS NOT KNOWN. EXACTLY WHEN THE BOND ISSUES PUT ON THE BALLOT WHAT IF IT'S TIED TO SOMETHING LIKE LIVE MORE. WHAT IF THE? RATE OF THE TAX THAT HAS TO BE CHARGED AGAINST PROPERTY IS DEPENDENT ON THE OVERALL EVALUATION. OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT YOU KNOW IF I CAN GO UP OR DOWN WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS WE HAVE TO ESTIMATED WHAT ABOUT THAT SO THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE VERY VALID SO I I AUTHORED. LEGISLATION THIS YEAR JUST IN JANUARY AB TWENTY NINE FORTY EIGHT I THINK IT IS. THAT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS BUT IN MY NEGOTIATION WITH THESE GROUPS IT'S BECOME VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT. IS TO NOT HAVE TO TELL VOTERS THAT APPROVAL OF A BOND WILL INCREASE THEIR PROPERTY TAX. AND THAT'S BEEN A STICKY ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I AM WILLING TO DO I WANT TO FIX THE IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS  DON'T WANT TO GET RID. OF THE REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE. SO. THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY ARE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AN END RUN AROUND THE LEGISLATURE AND PASS THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS A COMPLETE EXEMPTION. FORM THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY DO ANY KIND OF DISCLOSURE WHEN THEY PUT A BOND ON THE BALLOT. DAY I'M SURE SENT ALL OF YOUR LETTER THE TO TO PROBABLY OF READ AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND DEBUNK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID. A ABOUT THIS ISSUE FIRST OF ALL ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR BOND MEASURES TO COMPLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE THERE HAVE BEEN. NUMEROUS POSITIVE INPUT ON THE BALLOT IN THE LAST YEAR SINCE ONE NINETY FOUR NINETY FIVE WAS SIGNED THAT HAVE LANGUAGE THAT. THAT COMPLIES GOING TO PASS THIS AROUND IF YOU WANNA TAKE A LOOK THIS IS JUST A FEW OF THEM. YOU CAN READ THROUGH THE LANGUAGE IT'S A LITTLE WORDY BUT AND AND I THINK TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE OR TWENTY NINE FORTY EIGHT THAT WERE DOING THIS YEAR. WOULD FIX WITHOUT BUT IT CERTAINLY IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE ANOTHER ONE OF THE ASSERTIONS AS THAT IT'S CONFUSING TO VOTERS AND WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT IF YOU READ LANGUAGE. IT'S NOT CONFUSING TO VOTERS IT'S CONFUSING TO BOND LAWYERS WHAT THE EXACT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX. BUT IT THERE'S NO VOTER CONFUSION. ANOTHER THING THAT THEY'RE CRITICIZING IS THAT THEY'RE SPENDING A THIRD OF THE WORDS ON THE BALLOT LABEL. ONE THE DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO REDUCE ACTUALLY SO I'M WORKING TO IT TO GET THAT. TO TO BE LOWER BUT EVEN IF IT IS A THIRD THEIR SPENDING TWO THIRDS OF THE BALLOT LABEL TELLING ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT BOND DOES THAT A THIRD TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THE BOND ACTUALLY COSTS SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S OF A BAD COMPROMISE AND AND THIS THE CLIP I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY PUT THIS IN THEIR LETTER? BUT I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE CRITICIZING IS THAT THEY'VE DONE POLLING AND DECIDED THAT SOME OF THE BONDS THAT THEY WANT. TO. YOU PUT ON THE BALLOT ARE LESS LIKELY TO PASS IF THEY MAKE THE DISCLOSURE. SO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND THERE SAYING VOTERS MIGHT NOT VOTE FOR THE BOND IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE VOTING ON. WHICH I THINK IT IS A RIDICULOUS REASON TOOK TO NOT DO THE SCHOOL DISCLOSURE BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT DOES MAKE A THE BAR A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DISCLOSURE BUT MANY BONDS HAVE PASSED WITH THE DISCLOSURE IN THERE AND I THINK IT'S JUST FAIR THAT VOTERS KNOW BOTH THE GOOD AND THE BAD OF WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON THE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT THE BOND WILL DO? AND THEY DID YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST THEM. AND. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO ADDRESS IS THAT THE CLAIM IS THAT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN THE BUDGET. IS IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS ISSUE FIXED BEFORE THE BOND MEASURES GO ON THE BALLOT FOR THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR FIVE MONTHS NOW ALREADY ON SOLUTION. YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AN END RUN AROUND HERE WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT'S THAT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT. BUT ARE WE CAN STILL GET THIS FIXED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS ARE GONNA VEHICLE IN THE SENATE I'M I'M HAPPY TO ADD URGENCY TO THAT AMENDED THE LANGUAGE I THINK WE CAN GET THIS. FIXED IN PLENTY OF TIME TO GET THIS ADDRESSED FOR FOR NOVEMBER SO. I WANT TO ASK YOU TO. TO PLEASE LET US FIX THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUESTED. AND A LET'S ADOPT THE SENATE VERSION SO I ASK YOU WHEN WHEN IT COMES TIME TO VOTE ON THIS AND ASK FOR SEPARATE VOTE. AND IVF PLEASE VOTE NO OR EITHER A EITHER A NO VOTE OR AN ABSTENTION. AND GIVE US THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND FIXES LEGISLATIVELY BECAUSE IF WE EXEMPT THEM FROM ANY KIND OF DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE THIS PROVIDES THEM NO INCENTIVE TO SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. AND GET THIS DONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. AND I A BETWEEN NINE FORTY DID YOUR VEHICLE THAT'S CORRECT AND IT'S IN THE SENATE WHERE ARE NO IT IS AND IT IS NOT PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY AB SIX. THAT YOU THAT YOU LIVE IS YET ANOTHER BEE HIVE OF AB SIX IN THE SENATE AND SENATE RULES AND I I WOULD. I JUST I WAS GONNA MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMETHING WHERE I'M TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO BE IN A COMMITTEE RIGHT SO. AB SIX WILL AMEND THAT LANGUAGE AND AND. AND I THINK IT COULD BE DONE VERY AYE EXPEDITIOUSLY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BOB DYLAN AT JUST ONE I I I THINK AS FAR AS THE POLLSTERS SAID ARE CONCERNED DUH. I THINK THE CONCERN RELATES MORE TO VOTER CONFUSION THAT IT DOES TO VOTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT TOOK A THAT WE SEE HERE. I'M I THINK CAN FAIRLY BE INTERPRETED TO BE A CONFUSING THE VOTERS IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE VOTER PAMPHLETS THAT EXPLAINED WHAT BALLOT MEASURES ARE ALL ABOUT IN GREAT DETAIL. AND THE. LANGUAGE IN THE BALLOT ITSELF IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SUMMARY. DON'T KNOW THAT IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT I. WE INTEND TO MAKE IT A SUMMARY BUT WE ARE WE DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE ANYBODY BUT ONE THING THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO. IS TO AVOID SAYING TO PEOPLE THIS WILL INCREASE YOUR PROPERTY TXES IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BOND. THAT'S A THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE STICKY ISSUE AND AND THE OTHER THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RATE OF THE BOND AND THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I'M FINE PUTTING IN THE VOTER. INFORMATION PAMPHLET. AND THE TAX RATE STATEMENT BUT. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO DISGUISE THE FACT THAT IT IS A TAX INCREASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINETEEN LANGUAGE FOR COUNTY VOTING SYSTEMS REPLACEMENT FUNDING ALEJO. OF THE SENATE ASSEMBLING GOVERNOR INCLUDED THE SAME FUNDING LEVEL TO REPLACE VOTING SYSTEMS AND THE COUNTIES. UP AT THE ASSEMBLY TOP TO TBL NOT INCLUDED. BY THE SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR. OF THE LANGUAGE WOULD. SPECIFY HOW COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO STICK TO ACQUIRE THE FUNDS. PAST THANK YOU WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION I JUST KNOW THAT WHEN WE BUILT THIS PROPOSAL WE INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. AND THAT ESTIMATE ASSUMES THAT STATES AND COUNTIES WILL SHARE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE ESTIMATED COSTS. OF REPLACEMENT AND ALL COUNTIES WITH FIFTY OR MORE PRECINCTS WOULD ADOPT THE VOTE CENTER MODEL AUTHORIZED BY AS BEFORE FIFTY RECENTLY. ON I THINK OUR PROBLEM WITH THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THIS ITEM IS THAT SOME OF THE ITEMS WILL LIKELY INCREASE COST BEYOND WHAT WE'VE BUDGETED FOR THIS. INCLUDING. LOOKING AT A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR VERSUS THE MATCH COMPONENT WE HAVE AS WELL AS INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OBVIOUSLY WOULD SHIFT COSTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN OUR ESTIMATE. THANK YOU THE QUESTIONS. CENTER NIELSEN AMATEUR I THINK WE SHOULD THE. HAVE THIS ONE SEPARATELY CONSIDERED WE DON'T HAVE ANY LANGUAGE YET HAVE TO LOOK AT AND BEFORE WE PULLED. THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUST ASSUME WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AND. LET OUR STAFF ANALYZE IT. AND THE MEMBERS CONSIDER. SO NOT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SCENE NINE ISSUE TWENTY VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS AFTERNOON ERIC ROBERT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO THE ISSUE OF BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M IN THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROP NINETY GENERAL FUND. FOR COLLEGES TO CREATE OR EXPAND THEIR BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS THE GOVERNOR AND SENATOR TOOK NO ACTION. I MEAN JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT LAST YEAR OF THE STATE CREATED A NEW ONGOING CATEGORICAL PROGRAM FOR VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS THOSE FIVE MILLION ONGOING. AND ALSO INCLUDED FIVE MILLION ONE TIME. FOR COLLEGES INTERESTED TERROR DIDN'T IN ARE CREATING ARE NEW OR EXPANDING THE RESOURCE CENTERS. I'M THE FUNDING IS TO BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION WITH THE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COLLEGE. AND THE FUNDS HAVE NOT YET BEEN DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS ARE DUE AT THE END OF JUNE. THAT IN DIRE THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PERSONS ABOUT THIRTY COLLEGES I'M SO IF YOU YOU DID PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THIS WOULD. COULD BE USED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND THOSE THIRTY IF THERE WAS A IF THERE WAS GREATER DEMAND. WE DON'T HAVE. INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS YET BUT BASED ON OUR DISCUSSES THE CHANCES OF THE CONFLICT THERE ARE MORE THAN HUNDRED COLLEGES WERE ON BUT I AM INTERESTED IN APPLYING THROUGH IN IT AS PART OF A WEAPON ARE. ACOSTA. THANK YOU ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION OF THIS THIS. IS ONE OF THE. COMPONENT PIECES OF THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE AND WILL COMPORT TO THE FINAL PROP NINETY PACKAGE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU ISSUE TWENTY ONE RE ENTRY INMATE EDUCATION. SO ON THIS ISSUE BOTH HOUSES TO PER FAME ACTION THEY ADDED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR SUPPORTING CURRENT FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. I'M TO QUALIFY FOR THE GRANT BECAUSE OF MUST AGREE TO PROVIDE SOME MATCHING FUNDS AND MARK BECAUSE COULD USE THIS FUNDING FOR SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE COUNSELING. ARE TUTORING ARAB MENTORING I'M THAT THIS IS OUR PART OF JUST CONTACT AND A SERIES OF ACTIONS INSTEAD OF TAKING IN THE PAST. TO OUR OUR INCREASE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR OUR INMATES OR. PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS FOR OF OUR. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEDERAL INCARCERATED I'M A FEW YEARS AGO ARE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. THIRTY NINETY ONE WHICH MADE IT EASIER FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO PROVIDE FIFTH RECONSTRUCTION. AT THAT THE CDC ARE INMATES THURMOND AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE FIT ALSO DIRECTED THE CHANCES OFFICE TO IDENTIFY DISTRICTS. WILLING TO USE SOME OF THEIR FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO MATCH SOME PRIOR FOUNDATION FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PILOTING SOME PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR. FOR THE STUDENTS. TO VOTE TO ACCEPT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WE THINK THIS IS A PARTICULAR STUDENT GROUP THAT IS A PROBLEM OF WHAT HAS. OF MANY CHALLENGES WE THINK THAT THAT IS A REASONABLE AND THERE IS A SIMILAR ACTION THAT ALL HOPE BOTH HOUSES APPROVAL WITH ME REVISED PROPOSAL TO INCREASE. FUNDING FOR OUR NEW A PROGRAM FOR FOSTER USED BY FIVE MILLION SO WE COULD THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES THERE. WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THESE ARE ONE TIME FUNDS. WHEREAS THE NEED FOR THE POOR THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY ONGOING ONGOING NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THIS PARTICULAR RISK GROUP OF STUDENTS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. ABSENT THE POLICY MERITS OF THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BOTH HOUSE FUNDED THIS LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION BY REJECTING THE ADMINISTRATION STUDENT CENTERED. ON A FUNDING FORMULA IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH WE STILL SUPPORT. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CENTER AYE SKINNER. S. WANTED TO. TO THE ISSUE AND PUT SOME CONTEXT WE HAVE. FORTUNATELY AGREE PRESENCE OF OUR COMMUNICATIVE SYSTEM WITH IN OUR STATE PRISON FACILITIES. AND WITH. THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN EDUCATION CREDITS WE HAD THERE'S MORE MOTIVATION FOR MANY OF OUR INCARCERATED FOLKS TO. TO FURTHER THEIR EDUCATION AND TO PARTICIPATEWITHIN ME COMMUNICABLE ITCH. OFFERINGS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND AS RESULT WHEN NAY. THOSE. THAT ARE. RELEASED. BECAUSE OF ALREADY THEIR FAMILIARITY. WITH BETWEEN COLLEGE PROGRAM HAVING BEEN EXPOSED TO IT WITHIN THIS STATE FACILITY. DAY IF THEY WANT TO PURSUE EDUCATION ARE THERE'S ARE INDEED WE'VE CREATED A BRIDGE SO THERE'S ALREADY A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. AND. OBVIOUSLY OUR REENTRY FOLKS ARE. SUCCESSFUL RE ENTRY INTO COMMUNITY IS. NOT. BUT HAS A LOT OF OBSTACLES AND SO THE MORE SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE AND FOR THOSE. FOLKS WHO WE RELEASE WHO DO AND THEN END UP AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM VERY. VERY. TARGETED OUR OR SPECIFIC TYPE OF SUPPORT. I THINK THE DATA SHOWS INDICATES THAT THEY WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE DEBATE. AND I THINK GIVEN THE COSTS OF OUR PER PERSON INCARCERATION WHICH IS EXPECTED BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE EITHER NINETEEN TWENTY OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO HIT NINETY THOUSAND YEAR. INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE THAT REDUCE RECIDIVISM ARE. VERY. SMART INVESTMENTS SO SICK GOOD PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU SEEN NONE WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY TWO CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR CREDIT. FOR PROFIT UNIVERSE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES. ELIOT. GRAYSON CONCENTRA O. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU PERTAINS TO FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS WITH WASP ACCREDITATION WAS BECAUSE THE BODY THAT ACCREDITS MOST NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE STATE. FOR SOME CONTEXT AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IT'S ANTICIPATED ABOUT FOUR OF THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE HOW THEY ARE FOR PROFIT AND LOSS CREDITED. WILLING LOW CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS AT C. SACK DISSIPATES WILL BE ENROLLED AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CAL GRANT. BOTH HOUSES OF. OF. AGREED TO PROVIDE A. FOR JUST OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE AWARD AMOUNT FOR. STUDENTS ATTENDING THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE THAT'S A THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD PROPOSED. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSES. TO TIE A THAT A ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENTIAL TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS. ADMITTING MORE COMEDIC COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS OR PROVIDING MORE INSTITUTIONAL AID. OF FOR CAL GRANT STUDENTS THE SENATE ADULT JUST DID NOT ADOPT SUCH EXPECTATIONS ARE TO THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS DIFFERENTIAL. FOR SOME CONTEXT ARM THE BOTH HOUSES ALSO PROVIDED A SIMILAR WORD AMOUNT FOR THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. TO A TIE THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENTIAL TO THE TO THE NONPROFIT SECTOR ADMITTING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. WE RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE SENATE ON THIS ACTION. THE ASSEMBLY WAS TRYING TO DO WHICH WAS TO TREAT THESE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THE WAY BOTH HOUSES ARE TREATING. OTHER NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS BUT THE TO THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. HAVE A BODY THAT. REPRESENTS THEM IT HAS COMMITTED TO TO HELP COORDINATE THEIR ACTIVITIES WE WE WEREN'T AWARE OF SUCH A BODY THAT WOULD DO THIS FOR THE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. WE THINK IT'S ALL MORE CHALLENGING TO TREAT THEM EXACTLY THE SAME. AND IT ONE ONE. OPTION YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS TO IS TO IT TAXIS EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION LEVEL RATHER THAN THE SECTOR LEVEL BUT THEN AGAIN YOU'RE NOT. THAT THAT WOULDN'T EXACTLY TREATING THEM THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TREATING THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT REASON WE WE COULD WE CAN THINK OF ARE WE COULDN'T CERTIFICATE THAT. THANK YOU WE DON'T SUPPORT EITHER VERSION OBVIOUSLY BY BUYING OUT THIS PORTION AND IT. CREATES. FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR GENERAL FUND COST NOT ACCOUNTED FOR THE GOVERNOR'S FISCAL PLAN. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF MEMBERS. THANK YOU AYE YEAH ISSUE TWENTY THREE. YOU SEE RESEARCH LL. THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU PERTAINS TO THREE RESEARCH PROPOSALS ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY OF THE NOT THE SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR. YOU CONCEIVE EACH PROPOSAL LISTED ON YOUR AGENDA FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ALONE INTRODUCED THEM COMPREHENSIVELY WE DO HAVE COMMENTS ON EACH ONE THOSE ALL WALK THROUGH EACH ONE OF THOSE. ON THE FIRST ISSUE FOUR SEVEN AND A HALF MILLION FOR OPIOID RESEARCH WE UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING AS PRIMARILY TO RETRAIN PHYSICIANS. ON A MANAGING PAIN A USING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OTHER THAN PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS. I'M I DISHED UP A PORTION OF THE FUNDS ARE ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCHING ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES AS WELL. EXPERTS HAVE IDENTIFIED A RETRAINING PHYSICIANS AS ONE. BUT STEP THAT THE STATE COULD TAKE TO ADDRESS THE BROADER OPI CRISIS AND STATE. I'M SO THE ISSUE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS REALLY WHETHER THE ASSEMBLIES ACTION TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM WOULD BE THE BEST WAY. TO RETRAIN PHYSICIANS ACROSS THE STATE OR WHETHER THE ISSUE IS MORE FUNDAMENTAL IN THE WAY WE EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND CONTINUED EDUCATED RETRAIN PHYSICIANS IN MOTHER MARK MORE TARGETED ACTION COULD BE DOWN THERE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. ON THE SECOND PROPOSAL FOR. PROVIDING A RESEARCH FUNDING FOR RESEARCHING THE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF CONSUMING SUGAR AND SOLID FOOD VERSES LIQUID. HERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THIS IS A QUESTION OF SORT OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY UP TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS WE RECOMMEND DELETING TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS FUND THAT WOULD BE USED FOR. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY PROVIDES A FUNDING FOR AND SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE LOTS OF. ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS WE DO THINK THAT ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE UNNECESSARY. AND THEN FINALLY FOR THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH WE RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE SENATE HERE. OF WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE THE SENATE WAS APPROPRIATED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING IS IS STILL ON SPENT AND SO WE'D WE RECOMMEND. I HAVING A CENTER SPEND DOWN MORE THAT FUNDING REPORT BEFORE PROVIDING. ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTURY ALSO. MADAM CHAIR JUST TO BE A SEPARATE ITEM TO VOTE THANK YOU. SO NOW IT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT AMPLIFYING CENTER NIELSEN SCOTT A REQUEST. I WOULD REQUEST WHEN IT COMES TIME TO VOTE ON THIS TICKET SPLIT OFF THE OPIOID RESEARCH FROM THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD BE. A PROBABLE. SO NOW IT I WOULD. SENATOR SKINNER. WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS ITEM AND OBVIOUSLY SENATE DIDN'T HEAR IT. INDIVIDUALLY THAT. PLACES THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSING RESEARCH. KIDNAP IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE GREAT MERIT. WHAT MY ISSUE IS IS THE TERM? SUBSTITUTING. IT A FACT FINDING THAT NEW RESEARCH THROUGH THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS. SOME OF WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED LEGISLATIVELY. AND. FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM ANALYSIS TO CARE THE HEALTH INITIATIVES OF AMERICA VERY SUTTER THINGS I KNOW THE YOU SEE MEXICO INITIATIVE WAS RELEASED DONE THROUGH THE BUDGET IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. AND. IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE SITUATIONS WHERE. WELL AT LEAST FOR MYSELF I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE PUT IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO SAY. NO TO THIS EXISTING RESEARCH AND PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO SAY YES TO. A PROPOSED. RESEARCH SO THAT WOULD BE A DIFFICULTY FOR ME. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WHO CONDUCTS? ISSUE TWENTY FOUR TEACHING ABOUT LABOR PILOT PROGRAM. HOWEVER. BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ASSEMBLY. PROVIDES TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION AND ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO ESTABLISH. THE. LABOR HISTORY EDUCATION PILOT PROGRAM AND THESE FUNDS SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO SIX COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE BOOK OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO PAY A TEACHER FULL TIME IN EACH OF THESE COUNTIES TO DEVELOP AND DISSEMINATE CURRICULUM RELATED TO LABOR ISSUES. THANK YOU ACOSTA. THIS IS AYE AND AUGMENTATION THAT WILL CONFORM TO THE FINAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THAT POINT WHEN WE GET TO THE. PROP NINETY EIGHT QUOTE PACKAGE I'D LIKE TO SURE BE ASSURED THAT THAT'S GONNA BE A SEPARATE ITEM TO BE CONSIDERED. ALSO. AND THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE MOST ASSUREDLY SHOULD BE WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THIS TEACHING ABOUT LABOR MEANS WHAT WILL BE THE CURRICULUM WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS. WELL LOOK ALL. WILL BE A BALANCED PRESENTATION THERE A LOT OF ISSUES HERE THAT IT IS NOT A SIMPLE. THE ISSUE. SO BEFORE WE. DO MORE AND MORE ON THIS WE NEED TO SEE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT THE CURRICULUM AND. GOAL. THE DURATION VISIT FOR JUST ONE YEAR. WHAT WE TRIED TO CREATE HERE IS AN ONGOING PROGRAM THAT WILL BE EXPANDED TO ALL SCHOOLS? AND IF SO HOW. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR. CONNECTS. OKAY SEEN NONE ISSUE TWENTY FIVE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES BRIDGE PROPOSAL ELLIOTT. SENATE HEADACHE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THIS ISSUE CONCERNS BRIDGE FUNDING FOR VENDORS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS. TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY RATE INCREASE FOR VENDORS IN HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE. NAMELY THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE A LOCAL LOCALLY MANDATED MINIMUM WAGE THAT EXCEEDS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THE STATE WOULD DRIVE DOWN ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS ON TOP OF THE FIFTY MILLION. THIS ONE TIME APPROPRIATION IS MEANT TO BRIDGE. THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CAN COMPLETE ITS ONGOING. RATE STUDY AND IMPLEMENT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT RATE STUDY. WE WOULD JUST RAISE A COUPLE ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. WE WOULD NOTE THAT RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS IN A REALLY INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT. POSITION. ON THE ONE HAND IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE. POLICY DECISIONS MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE STATE HAS ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE WENCH MEN OUT TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND IF THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NO LONGER ADEQUATE BECAUSE VENDORS CAN NOT BY THE VENDOR RATES CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH RISING COSTS THE STATE WILL STRUGGLE TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATION UNDER THE LANTERN ACT. THIS PROPOSAL UNDER CONSIDERATION DOES HAVE SOME DRAWBACKS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IT'S A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO A LONG TERM. PROBLEM. THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO WEIGH THOSE DRAWBACKS AGAINST ITS BENEFITS PRIMARILY THAT IT WOULD. POTENTIALLY STAVE OFF. PRO PROGRAM CLOSURES UNTIL A MORE LONG TERM SOLUTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED. THANK YOU. TIMES AFTER CLEAR FINE POINTLESS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MIND BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO YOUR TESTIMONY SO YOU SAID IT'S IT'S IT'S A LONG TERM PROBLEM SO. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING READ THE PROPOSAL THAT REALLY IS A BRIDGE UNTIL THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED AND AND MY ASSUMPTION IS. AND THEREFORE THE DEPARTMENT WITHIN TAKE ACTION ON THEIR SURVEY RESULTS AND. PERHAPS INCREASE OUR REIMBURSEMENT SO WHY DO YOU NOT SEE THIS AS TRULY SHORT TERM. SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THERE PROPOSING I ASSUME TO FIX. WELL I THE IE CERTAINLY DIDN'T MEAN FOR THAT TO COME OFF AS CYNICAL. THE IT'S YOU KNOW EVERY IT'S EVERYBODY'S HOPE THAT THE RATE STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE RATE STRUCTURE THAT THE RATE SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND PROVIDE SOME. ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE. AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I READ STUDY HAS BEEN DONE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT COSTS ARE NOT GOING THAT COSTS ARE HOLDING STEADY OR GOING DOWN COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE. IN SOME OF THESE AREAS PARTICULARLY THE AREAS WHERE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING THEIR MINIMUM WAGE SO. HOPEFULLY THE RATE STUDY YOU KNOW WILL PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS BUT. I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. EVEN IF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RATE STUDY ARE IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT AS AS I CAN RECALL THERE BEEN TIMES WHEN RATE STUDIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND NO ACTION TAKEN SO THAT WE CAN ALL KIND OF IN THE ACTUALLY. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION IS COST. THANK YOU WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION AGAIN THIS IS A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION BUT I WOULD ACT OF SOME OF THE COMMENTS REYES BY THE ANALYSTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. ONE I THINK WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT BY UTILIZING THE LOCALLY ENACTED MINIMUM WAGE WE ARE SETTING A PRECEDENT ON THAT COULD INCREASE GENERAL FUND COST. ON WHAT'S REALLY A LOCAL DECISION SECONDARILY WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE IRATE STUDY BE COMPLETE WHICH IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MARCH FIRST OF TWENTY NINETEEN TO INFORM THESE ODD DECISIONS. DO YOU AT ALL ACKNOWLEDGED THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE WITH REGARD TO THE LANTERN ACT AND THEREFORE THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY VERTICALLY TO THIS SERVICE POPULATION THAT WOULD. NOT NECESSARILY SET A PRECEDENT ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS ALL STATE. DEPARTMENT SO WITH REGARD TO MUNICIPALITIES THAT INCREASE. THEIR MINIMUM WAGE. I THINK I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN OTHER PROGRAM AREAS WHERE WE CAN GET GET CONCERNED ABOUT A LOCAL DECISION DRIVING OUR COSTS WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE. ON AND SO THAT DOES CREATE GENERAL FUND COST PRESSURES AYE. I AGREE THAT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME UNIQUE ELEMENTS HERE GIVEN THE LANHAM ACT AND THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTO NIELSEN. BUT IT SURE LIKE TO SEPARATE ITEM ON THIS ONE IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT. POTENTIAL I THINK SO NOTED. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I'M. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. ARAMBULA. I WAS LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT COMPANY FORGET. CREDIT TO MY A A TO NOT MY HEART ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL REMEMBER ARAMBULA. I COULD. I'M I I DID WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS IF I COULD AND I WANTED TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WHO HAS MADE THIS A TOP PRIORITY FOR. HIM AS WELL AS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CAUCUS ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. I DID WANT TO MENTION A FEW EXAMPLES WHERE I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE ADJUSTED OUR POLICIES AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. TO MATCH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE IN ONE OF THOSE BEING AYE CHESS ES. AM I WANTED TO ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I COULD IF THERE WERE CREATIVE WAYS TO HELP US TO BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE. I DO FEEL THAT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE THIS. RATE STUDY THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH BUT IS THERE ANOTHER MECHANISM FOR US TO. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BRIDGE FUNDING AND WOULD THAT HAVE TO BE A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WHERE YOU HAD A. SIMILAR APPROACH FOR ALL COUNTIES RATHER THAN TARGETING IT TOWARD THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE HIGH PRICE AND WHAT DOES THAT DO TO CHANGE THE TOTAL PRICE FOR THIS. BECAUSE THE LARGEST CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IS ACTUALLY THE CLOSURE OF FACILITIES. IT'S WHEN WE. HAVE MADE IT SO TOUGH FOR ENDS TO MEET. THE PLACES AND HIGH COST. COUNTIES ARE NOW CLOSING THEIR FACILITIES AND WHAT COST THAT IS THEN TO THE STATE FOR US TO RESTART AND RECREATE MANY OF THE. WE DO BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND WE BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. GOVERNMENT. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT'S GO TO ISSUE TWENTY SIX HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ELIO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. CHAD ALAMO AT THE ANALYST'S OFFICE BE ASSEMBLY BUDGET PACKAGE INCLUDES THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONE TIME. FOR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT WORK WITH HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS. SERVICES THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THESE GRANTS INCLUDE. MEAL PREPARATION DELIVERED MEALS ON SOME IN HOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES AS WELL AS A ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY ACTIVITIES OUR OFFICE IS NOT HAVE A PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE PROPOSAL. HAPPY TAKING. VICTIMS COST. THIS IS A GENERAL FUND LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATE MORLOCK. YOU MISTER CHAIR I I SEEM TO RECALL THAT. MATT FONG WHEN HE WAS STATE TREASURER HE TRIED TO GET SOME KIND OF. I GUESS RESTITUTION. FOR. THINGS THAT WERE DONE BY GERMANY DURING WORLD WAR TWO. AND. HE'D JOINED IN WITH A COALITION OF OTHER. I STATES AND COUNTRIES. AND SO I'M WONDERING. IF WE WE SHOULD BE CONTACTING THE STATE TREASURER AGAIN TO SEE IF THERE'S. A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY THERE'S WELL FOR THIS. PARTICULAR NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TAYLOR. COMMENTS. OKAY. GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN FAMILY URGENT. RESPONSE SYSTEM. HI BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BUT ASSEMBLY TOOK ACTION TO PROVIDE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING TO CREATE THE FAMILY URGENT RESPONSE SYSTEM. WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE HOTLINE FOR FOSTER CARE. PARENTS TO CALL INTO IN CASES OF EMERGENCY AND OR OR CRISIS FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN ALSO TO ESTABLISH MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS THAT COULD GO AND DELIVER ON SITE SERVICES. TO AMELIORATE THAT SITUATION HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THOUGH EXCUSE ME THE SENATE DID NOT TAKE ACTION ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU THIS COST. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION THIS IS A GENERAL FUND LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYTHING CLARIFICATION IS THIS. EXPANSION AWE OF A CURRENT PROGRAM IS DOES IT EXIST AT ALL WITHIN THE C. FEE. IT DOES NOT THIS WOULD BE A NEW PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. INTERESTING AND OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTION FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT CERTAIN SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S. IS CORRECT THAT IT IS NOT IN EXISTING STATEWIDE PROGRAM. THOUGH THERE ARE SOME REGIONS THAT HAVE SOMETHING ANALOGOUS THOUGH IT'S NOT YET INTEGRATED INTO. THE WHOLE STATEWIDE CONTINUUM OF CARE. I'M AND THERE MAY BE SOME SUMMER PROGRAMS. IN CERTAIN COUNTIES. THERE ARE SORT OF MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS OUT WITHIN THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM AS WELL AND OUT WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHICH BUDGET LEGISLATURE HAS FUNDED OVER THE YEARS UP BUT THIS WOULD BE UNIQUE TO THE FOSTER CARE POPULATION. THE CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAM WAS. MY MEMORY SERVES ME. TO ASSIST US IN THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM GROUP HOMES. IT WOULD SEEM THAT. IN SOME CASES THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WERE IN GROUP HOMES WERE CONSIDERED. MOST DIFFICULT TO PLACE WITHIN THE. ARE. TYPICAL FOSTER CARE STRUCTURE. AND. MY UNDERSTANDING OF. PART OF THE MOTIVATION OF THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING THAT'S. MUST GIVE US THE RESPONSE THAT ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE. STRUCTURE OF THE. OF MAY REVISE IS. GENERAL FUND THAT YOU CAN'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. BUT. IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AM GUESSING YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THIS BUT THIS SEEMS TO ME. TWO VERY MUCH FIX. THE GOALS OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE IN IN MOVING AWAY FROM GROUP HOMES WE ARE PUTTING SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT. A PLACE KIDS INTO. THE DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW TO FOSTER CARE HOMES WHO WOULD THEN HAVE THAT MANY MORE CHALLENGES. AND THIS IS TO DEAL WITH THOSE TYPE OF URGENT CHALLENGES. SO I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT. ALRIGHT. AND PERFORMANCE THINKING SURE. YOU CHRIS GOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE AS. DELEO NOTED THAT NOT SPECIFIC TO FOSTER CARE BUT CRISIS SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH. EARLY AN AREA PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT. AND ALSO. I WOULD NOTE THAT I. ON THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY DID RECEIVE SOME. MOBILE CRISIS FINDING AND THAT THEY HAVE. I BELIEVE TO SB. EIGHT THIRTY THREE AND SOME ALSO SOME GENERAL FUND. IN THERE AND RANGE OF TWENTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION SPECIFIC FOR CRISIS SERVICES AGAIN NOT. SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO FOSTER YOUTH BUT AVAILABLE FOR YOUTH AND. BUT THERE IS NO MYSTERY HERE. BUT THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK. TO THOSE SERVICES BOTH IN THE CCR THAT IS CORRECT NOW NINETY RECTALLY MAY BUILD ENOUGH. THANK YOU SIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED. THERE'S A POLICY. THE BILL. MADAM VICE CHAIR A. B. TWENTY FORTY THREE THAT. I'M CARRYING THIS YEAR THAT'S DEALING WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT'S BEFORE US SOME WOULD JUST ENCOURAGED SENATORS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS. TUB FOLLOW UP WITH THAT POLICY BILL THAT IS AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH THE VERY REAL PROBLEM THAT I BELIEVE SENATOR SKINNER. SUMMARIZED QUITE WELL WHICH IS. THE FACT THAT WE CRIMINALIZE TOO OFTEN OUR GROUP HOMES AND FOSTER KIDS AND IS THERE A. RESPONSE SYSTEM TO DEAL WITH THE CRISES. I BELIEVE THAT FURS IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE AND WE'RE TRYING TO BOTH HAVE A BUDGET AND POLICY DISCUSSION THE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. CLASSICAL THANK YOU SIR SKINNER CAN'T HELP IT CHAIR OF SUB FIVE. THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTICE YOU POINTED OUT AND. SENATOR ROBERT LIKE THAT FROM HER ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA THAT. UNFORTUNATELY VERY FREQUENTLY THESE ARE THE YOUTH THAT THAT THE YEAR TWO WOULD. HAVE BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SERVICE AND THE FAMILIES WHO WOULD. OUR YOUTH THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE. AND MOSTLY END UP IN OUR. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BUT THE OTHER COROLLARY HERE IS THAT A LARGE PERCENT OF THEM ARE IN THE FOSTER ARE SYSTEM DUE TO THEIR OWN PARENTS BEING INCARCERATED. SO IT WE IT'S THAT USUAL. I TUITION WHERE THINGS ARE VERY INTEGRATED AND THE MORE WE CAN DO TO. KEEP KIDS OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHICH IS COURSE KEEPING THEIR PARENTS OUT OF BEING INCARCERATED AND KEEPING THOSE KIDS WHO ARE THEN IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OUT OF BEING INCARCERATED. THEN. WE CAN REDUCE THAT GROWING UP BUDGETARY GENERAL FUND PRESSURE HUNDRED PERCENT GENERAL FUND THAT CDC ARE REPRESENTS WHICH IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND. CLEANING THE TWO YEARS I HAD INTRO MAPPED. HAS GROWN PROPORTIONATELY MORE THAN ALMOST EVERY OTHER PORTION OF THE BUDGET EXCEPT FOR KATE TO TWELVE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY EIGHT ELIA. FOOD BANK INFRASTRUCTURE AUGMENTATION. THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AND THE SENATE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR A GRANT PROGRAM TO BE RUN OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COMMUNITY FOOD BANKS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO. ART REFRIGERATED FOOD STORAGE FOOD DELIVERY AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT FOOD BANKS USED TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY. OUR OFFICE DO NOT MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON THESE ITEMS LET MATTER OF LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THANK YOU THIS COST. HIS IS A LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TIME. SIR SKINNER. THANK YOU. THIS IS ONE OF THESE. THE INTERESTING IRONIES OF CALIFORNIA IN THAT. WE RIGHT NOW THE ECONOMY'S GOING GETTING. GO TORRENT GAVE US WAS A HIT THERE WERE IS GOING GREAT IS GROWING IS STRONG. AND OUR UNEMPLOYMENT SITS AT THE. I'M NOT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S AN ALL TIME LOW BUT IT IS IT GIVES VERY LOW RATE. AND YET. WHEN WE AYE INTERACT WITH OUR FOOD BANKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THEY HAVE MORE DEMAND. THEN ALMOST AT ANY OTHER TIME. AND. WE KNOW THAT PART OF THE PART OF THAT IS DUE TO THE. OTHER COSTS THAT HAVE INCREASED SUCH AS HOUSING COSTS WHICH PUT FAMILIES IN A SITUATION WHERE. IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET THEY. IT YOU KNOW TO COVER THEIR HOUSING COSTS. OR EVEN HEALTH CARE COSTS THEN THEY END UP. HAVING TO RELY ON A FOOD BANK. AND ALSO STILL EVEN WITH THE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. WE STILL OF A LARGE PERCENT OF OF. JOBS THAT ARE LOW WAGE JOBS SO WE HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF. WHAT WE'D CATEGORIZES THE WORKING POOR? AND WHAT WE'VE. SEE WITH THESE FOOD BANKS IS THAT THE FACT THAT WE'VE NOT MADE THAT SIGNIFICANT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE FREEZER FACILITIES AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE FOOD DONATIONS THAT THEY GET. FROM WHETHER IT'S. COMPANIES CORPORATE ENTITIES OR OTHERS AND SO GIVEN THE DEMAND ON OUR FOOD BANKS AT THIS TIME. AND KNOWING THAT IF THERE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS WERE MORE ADEQUATELY COVERED THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE. TO RESPOND TO THAT DEMAND BETTER I THINK THIS IS A WISE USE OF FUNDS EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE MAY REVISE. SO THE MORE LOOK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MISS COSTA. I WANT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE. PRIORITY THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN PLACING IN THIS BUDGET ON HOMELESS. AND IN THE HOMELESSNESS EFFORT I'M JUST WONDERING IF HE WOULD CONSIDER INCLUSION OF. THESE REQUESTS IN ITS OVERALL PORTFOLIO. AS HE ADDRESSES HOMELESSNESS THIS. THING OUT. SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OKAY. SING NOT ISSUE TWENTY NINE FOSTER PARENT RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT PROGRAM. MEN JOHNSON AND JOHNSON WITH THE LA OUT. THIS AUGMENTATION RELATES TO. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD PROVIDE TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN OR SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR. FOSTER CARE FOSTER PARENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THE ASSEMBLY AUGMENTED. BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IT TO INCREASE GENERAL FUND SPENDING ON THIS ITEM TO FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THEN ONGOING AS WELL WHILE THE SENATE DID AUGMENT FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ALSO. MAKING THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION BUT DID NOT TAKE ACTION ON. TO APPROVE FUNDING ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE RAISED. NO ISSUES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. RELATED TO THIS. THIS ITEM GIVEN THAT CC ARE CONTINUE OF CARA FORM EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY AND. ADDITIONAL FOSTER CARE GIVERS ARE NEEDED FOR THAT UP FOR THAT FOR THE EFFORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE DO THINK THAT UP APPROVING THIS ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS DOES MAKE SENSE AS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE. THE EFFECT OF THIS FUNDING ON IMPROVING OF THE NUMBER OF FOSTER CARE GIVERS IN THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU IT WAS COST. BOTH HOUSES DID APPROVE OUR PROPOSAL WHICH WE APPRECIATE OBVIOUSLY THE ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE FACT. THANK YOU. BUT THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OKAY SENILE THE WORLD MOVED ISSUE THIRTY CLINICAL. CLINICS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAME DAY VISITS. I'M THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM UP THE SENATE APPROVED THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THEREAFTER. TO ALLOW FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND OTHER. CLINICS WITHIN THE MEDICAID AND. SAFETY NET HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO BE A REIMBURSABLE AT LEE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND. GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THE SAME DAY. THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE. WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OBVIOUSLY IT'S A LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE WOULD KNOW THAT WE HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE SENATE'S COST ESTIMATE FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS UNDERSTATED. WE AT THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATE THE COST EXCEED ONE HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY. THANK YOU ETCETERA. THIS GOES THIS QUESTION GOES TO FINANCE COULD YOU PROVIDE SOME. FURTHER EXPLANATION MAY BE A BASIS FOR YOUR COST ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED MILLION. ADAM DORSEY FIND IT SO. THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS STRAPPED IT IS PROBLEMATIC FROM FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND. THE WAVE IT CLINIC BUNDLED RATES WORK TODAY IS THAT. ALL OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVERAGE PERSON THAT WALKS INTO THE CLINIC. ARE CAPTURED INTO A RATE FOR THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT CLINIC. SEE YOU TAKE ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY THE CLINIC OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR ANY DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF VISITS AND THAT'S THE RATE. AND THE WAY THAT THIS LANGUAGE IS DRAFTED IS THAT. YOU'RE YOU'RE ABLE TO BILL TWICE FOR THE SAME PATIENT. WHEN THOSE COSTS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THAT BUNDLE GREAT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK IN. AND REDO THE RATES OF THE U. PAUL THE SERVICE TO YOUR BILLING FOR SEPARATELY OUT. SO IN THE PAST WHEN WE'VE PULLED OUT. UM SERVICES FROM THE RATE LIKE DENTAL CAN BE BILLED SEPARATELY. MFPS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS A MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS OF PULLING THAT UP FOR THE RATE. THE CLINIC GOES AND THEY REDO THEIR RATES THAT THOSE COSTS AREN'T DOUBLE COUNTED. AND THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T DO THAT. AND SO IT ALLOWS CLINICS TO GO IN AND BILL THAT BUNDLED RATE MULTIPLE TIMES AND AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS PROPOSAL SO EXPENSIVE AND ALSO WE HAVE POLICY CONCERNS WITH THAT APPROACH. DO WE KNOW TODAY WHETHER. UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION WHETHER. PATIENTS ARE GOING IN FOR THEIR. PHYSICAL PROBLEM AND ON THE SAME DAY SEEING SOMEONE FOR A. SAVE YOUR WHOLE SERVICES. YES ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT CAN AND DOES HAPPEN DO WE KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT. THE WORDS ARE CLINICS. NOT SCHEDULING PEOPLE ON THE SAME DAY BECAUSE OF THIS THIS ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE MAN DIDN'T IN FACT SCHEDULING THEM IN A SUBSEQUENT DAY AND THEN THE PATIENT DOESN'T RETURN. OR ARE. THEY NOT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE BUNDLED RATE. APPARENTLY AT LEAST. TO THEIR PIC STATUS NOT SUFFICIENT. NOT SCHEDULING THEM FOR THE SAME DAY SERVICE AND IN FACT IT MAKES SENSE YEAH SO. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE CLINICS OVER THE YEARS AND AND WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO TRY TO. WORK WITH THEM I'M TO COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODOLOGY AND. THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW ONGOING OFTEN ON. YOU KNOW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. AND IT WAS TO GET OUT THAT INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND AND AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS AN INCENTIVE TO SEND SOMEONE AWAY WHEN THEY COULD BE SEEN ON THE SAME DAY. SO WHILE WE ARE. WE STRONGLY PETE THAT THAT THAT THE RAPE THAT REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO UNDER FEDERAL LAW ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF THEIR COSTS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE. AND AN INCENTIVE THAT ISN'T QUITE RIGHT FOR THE CLINIC TO SEND THEM AWAY SO THAT THEY CAN BILL FOR THAT BUNDLED RATE AGAIN IF THEY COME BACK ON A DIFFERENT DAY. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT WORK GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS IS THAT INCENTIVE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T WANT TO TALK AGAINST THE SENATE PROPOSAL HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT A PILOT PROGRAM TO REALLY TRY TO DRILL DOWN. ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COST IS BY. CHANGING THE. PAYMENT METHODOLOGY. YEAH THE AND THAT THAT IS WHAT THE GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT OVER WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE CLINICS BECAUSE. THIS I'M THIS TYPE OF BUNDLED RATE IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT IT'S ITSELF THAT SADDAM YOU KNOW THERE'S FEDERAL LAW LAWS THAT ENTITLED THE CLINICS THAT I SEE. THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE SOARED MISTER MISTER CHAIR FOR THE. EXTENDED QUESTIONING NOT AT ALL SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU WHICH STRUCK ME UP ABOUT YOUR COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE NOTION OF THE BUNDLE GREAT HOW THAT MAKES SENSE FOR FQHCS BUT AS YOU TALK ABOUT WE'VE ALREADY CARVED OUT. THERE'S A FAMILY THERAPIST AND AND DENTAL SERVICES. YOU KNOW. THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT PRACTITIONER WHO PROVIDED ME WITH THE CARE. IT'S A SPECIALIZED PRACTITIONER I'M NOT GONNA GO TO THE FQHC AND SEE MY PCP FOR MY. TO THE EXTRACTION. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF. YOUR CHALLENGES WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE SENATE PLAN. DEVELOPS IT AS OPPOSED TO. WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT IS A VALID. SERVICE TO CARVE OUT. THAT NOT THE WHAT BUT THE HOW WE DID IT LIKE YOU'VE DONE DENTAL IN MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. I DON'T THINK THAT. I DON'T THINK THAT ARE IT OUR OBJECTIONS HAVE FOCUSED BOTTOM AROUND. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S. GOOD POLICY TE. TAKE CAN TO CONTINUE THESE CARVE OUTS NECESSARILY I THINK THE WAY THAT THIS IS DONE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO GO BACK AND RELOOK AT THAT BUNDLED RATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR IT. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE ISSUE I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE. MAYBE AN EASIER PILL TO SWALLOW IF IT WERE JUST THAT NEVER JUST COME IT WOULD JUST DOLLARS RIGHT. I THINK THAT I THINK THAT. THE WHAT WE HAVE INDICATED DE I'M RECENTLY ON THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT. IT WOULD BE A MONEY ISSUE IF EVERYONE WERE FORCED TO COME IN AND REDO THAT RATE AND THAT IS. ON A POLICY BASIS. MAYBE A MORE FAIR WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING IT I'M EVEN IF IT'S COSTLY OP IF IT'S STILL COSTLY AS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS. AND IT TURNS BE IT BEEN COSTLY I THINK IT GETS TO SENATOR ROTH'S PIECE. AND AND SO MY QUESTION I BASK IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF. YOU YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT WERE NOT. CONTROLLING COSTS BY DEVELOPING SYSTEMS THAT. ON MAKE IT COMPLICATED FOR PEOPLE TO TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES IN THE HELP THEY NEED. THAT BY REQUIRING THAT IT NOT BE ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE ARE COUNTING BASICALLY SCORING SAVINGS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE AS THIRD PERCENT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WON'T COME BACK. BUT. HOW HOW YOU'VE COME? TO THIS FEE IS CURIOUS TO ME. IF INDEED THESE ARE SERVICES THAT FQHC PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED TO. AND WE'RE WE'RE. BY VIRTUE OF THEM NOT COMING ON SEPARATE DAYS WE'RE NOT PAN OUT THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TODAY YOU FOLLOW ME. I I DO I I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE. POINTS THAT WOULD BE REALLY TAKE ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON PEOPLE GETTING MULTIPLE SERVICES IN THE SAME DAY AND IN FACT THAT IS THE WAY THE RATES ARE BUILT THERE BUILT AROUND THE IDEA THAT. PATIENTS COME IN AND THEY ARE GETTING MULTIPLE SERVICES ON ONE DAY AND THAT'S WHY THAT THAT BUNDLED RATE IS. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES MUCH MORE THAN GOING AND SEEING A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. AND SO. THERE ISN'T A PROHIBITION ON RECEIVING MULTIPLE SERVICE DAY ALTHOUGH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THIS KIND OF INCENTIVE ARGUMENT IS THAT. MAYBE I A CLINIC WOULD BE ABLE TO GET MORE IF THEY SEND SOMEONE BACK THEY CAME BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY THEY COULD BUILD THAT READ AGAIN AND THAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND THIS WORK GROUP TO TRY TO GET AROUND AN ALTERNATIVE HIM AT ALL. THINKING THAT YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIMILAR PROBLEMS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A LOT NOW I'M REALLY CONFUSED AND KIND OF FLUMMOXED BY THIS BECAUSE THAT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE. ISSUE THAT'S PRESENTED TO US HERE ON IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CLINIC SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T. REFER IN THE SAME DAY A MINUTE THERE'S A TWENTY FOUR HOUR WAITING PERIOD AND AYE I IMAGINE WE'RE NOT GOING TO. RESOLVE THAT TO A DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S. BIZARRE TO ME THAT. THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE SUCH UP A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. AB. THE THE OTHER THING THAT IS A BIT TROUBLING TO ME IS THAT FOR AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF FOR ACUTE CARE SERVICES. I'M IN THE MOMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT AND THAT THEREFORE. THE POTENTIAL IS A GREAT POTENTIAL IS THAT SOME WILL NOT SOME WILL RECEIVE CARE DOWN THE ROAD. WHICH DURING WHICH THERE. OF SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY GET WORSE. THERE'S A A HUGE. PREVENTION ISSUE HERE THAT TOOK A AT THAT SEEMS TO EXIST BUT WHAT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS MIGHT. MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S THIRTY TWO OTHER STATES. THAT HAVE IN SOMEWHERE ANOTHER SOLVE THIS ISSUE AND ALLOW SAME DAY VISITS AND A. IT IS THERE. HAS THERE BEEN A REVIEW OF OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND. I THINK. IT'S NOT A QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER THE TIME THAT WE HAVE TODAY. WHY IT IS THAT TO HOPE A ONE OF THOSE MODELS MAYBE JUST ONE OF THEM OUT WHAT WORKED RELATIVELY WELL IN CALIFORNIA YEAH JUST TO CLARIFY I MEAN THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON SAME DAY VISITS THEIR RATE ASSUMES THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE GETTING? MULTIPLE SERVICES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME INTO THE CLINIC. TODAY BUT WE HAVE MADE. EXCEPTIONS IN STATE LAWS. THROUGH YOU KNOW PREVIOUS LEGISLATION. TO BILL FOR SERVICES SEPARATELY. AS WE TALKED ABOUT SO LET ME MAKE SURE I'VE FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING THAT WERE. OUR NOMENCLATURE SAME BECAUSE YOU'VE REPEATEDLY SAID. THERE'S NO PROHIBITION ON SAME DAY SERVICES AND WHAT I'M READING IS THAT THERE IS A REQUIREMENT OF A TWENTY FOUR HOUR GAP. IN SERVICES BETWEEN REFERRAL FROM PRIMARY CARE. AND THEN BEING SEEN BY MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER DOES THAT EXIST. THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY. THE CLINIC CANNOT BE ABLE THIS BUNDLED RATE MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE SAME DAY THEY HAVE TO THEY CAN THEY CAN BUILD THE BUNDLED RATES. YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING DAY OR IN IN A COUPLE DAYS WHATEVER IT IS THIS OTHER HOUSE TO BE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR GAP. IN ORDER TO BE. PAID. OUT IF THEY WANT TO BE PAID A A A A SEPARATE RATE IF YOU WILL A SEPARATE ANOTHER BUNDLED ES YES RATE. S. MEMORABILIA. YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES WE. GET MIXED UP IN THE NOMENCLATURE OR THAT TERMINOLOGY AND AND YET THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM. THAT SEEMINGLY IS GOING ON ADDRESSED INSIDE LIKE TO. SEE IF WE CAN BE CREATIVE TO ADDRESS THIS SERVICE AND I'M GOING TO. BRING MY MORE RURAL. ASPECT OF THE STATE INTO THIS DISCUSSION THAT. IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR STATE TO GET TO OUR FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS AND. GETTING BACK THE NEXT DAY IS DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS. MIGHT ISSUE STEMS FROM WHETHER THE RAIDERS SUFFICIENT. TO MEET BOTH. SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE SAME DAY BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE GROUND LEVEL FROM THE FQHCS IS THAT IT'S NOT. SO IS THERE A NEED TO LOOK AT THAT RATE THAT CAPITATED RATE TO AUGMENT IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MEETING THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STATE OR HOW BEST CAN WE INSURE THAT WE ARE. YEAH ALLOWING PEOPLE TO RECEIVE MULTIPLE SERVICES ON THE SAME DAY AND FOR PROVIDERS AND CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND THE DOORS OPEN. SO THAT MEAN THAT'S A REALLY HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE EVERY CLINIC IS DIFFERENT. CLINICS WILL ASK FOR A CHANGE IN THEIR SCOPE AND A CHANGE IN THE RATE. WHEN I'M WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY NEED THEY NEED IT. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY START OFFERING NEW SERVICES OR WHATEVER THEY CAN THEY CAN REQUEST IN THE RAIN. AND THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THAT WHEN YOU FIRST GET THAT RATES IT ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF THOSE COSTS RIGHT SO ALL OF THOSE COSTS ARE CALIFORNIA RATE AND THEN IT GROWS EVERY YEAR BY THE MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEX. SOME CLINICS COST MAY GROW FASTER SLOWER THAN ANY I BET. YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS THAT RIGHT THERE THAT IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT FOR THESE CLINICS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF THOSE COSTS IN GROWS EVERY YEAR. BET THAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY CLINIC FAIRS YOU KNOW I'M IS REALLY AN INDIVIDUAL SITUATION MAYBE THEN YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE AND. YOUR COST ANALYSIS SO YOU HAD STATE THAT IT WOULD BE CLOSER TOWARDS A HUNDRED MILLION AND SO. WHICH ASSUMPTIONS DID YOU MAKE THAT WERE NOT MADE IN THE SENATE SIDE THAT LED YOU TO THAT CONCLUSION. AND AND. START THAT YEAH SO WE'RE FINALIZING AN ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S BASED ON A COUPLE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS SO I'M WE HAVE A RANGE AT THE MOMENT. THAT KIND OF TRIES TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SORT OF AN ASSUMPTION AROUND. HOW MANY CLINICS WILL BE DO WILL DO BETTER UNDER THE CURRENT SORT OF GREAT METHODOLOGY AND AND NOT PASSED TO TO BUILD MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE SAME DAY? VERSUS. HOW MANY CLINICS THAT DO YOU IN SO WE HAVE A RANGE BASED ON SORT OF AN ASSUMPTION AROUND WHO ASKS FOR THIS CHANGE? AND AND THAT RANGE IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE LIKELY BETWEEN YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION. DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE AROUND THAT. BUT. AS WE FINALIZE THAT WILL MAKE SURE TO GET YOUR STAFF. AND AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THAT NIGHT ME JUST AND BY ECHOING SENATOR ROTH'S COMMENTS I THINK A PILOT PROGRAM LOOKING AT A. SMALLER SIZE TO. REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE FOR THE STATE WOULD BE. IN ORDER PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AS A STATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR SKINNER. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE MY. COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLIES COMMENTS ON THIS AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S AN ISSUE. BUT IT WOULD CLEARLY BE AN ISSUE IN RURAL AREAS JUST BECAUSE OF. DISTANCES IN SUCH TO THE CLINICS BUT IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE IN URBAN CLINICS. WE'RE DEALING WITH MOST THESE CLINICS ARE OBVIOUS THEY'RE DEALING WITH LOW INCOME POPULATIONS THEY ARE AS. AS I TALKED ABOUT IN THE. FOOD BANK ITEM IT'S. THE WORKING POOR IN MANY OF THESE FAMILIES THE. PEOPLE WHO ARE. THEY'RE WORKING SIXTY HOURS EIGHTY HOUR WEEKS THEY'D RELIEVED VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO. GET INTO THE CLINIC IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ONCE THEY GET IN OBVIOUSLY ARE CLINICS WANT TO TRY TO PROVIDE. AS MUCH SERVICES POSSIBLE AT THE POINT THAT THEY HAVE THE CLIENT PRESENT AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. YOU CAN OFTEN TIMES HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. PERHAPS THE PATIENT IS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER HAS TO PUSH THEM A BIT TO SEEK AND SO TO HAVE TO EXPECT THAT THE. TO RESCHEDULE IN RETURN ON A DIFFERENT DAY REALLY COMPLICATES TREATMENT. SO I THINK THAT. THIS IS A. AN IMPORTANT AREA IF WE WANT OUR CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO CAN. TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF QUALITY OF CARE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. AND. THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE CLIENTELE THAT THEY'RE SERVING. THANK YOU. NEITHER. QUESTIONS. COURTESY NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTY ONE. MOSQUITO SURVEILLANCE FUNDING LL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HELLO SONYA PICK FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THIS ISSUE RELATES TO THE CALIFORNIA VECTOR BORNE DISEASES SURVEILLANCE GATEWAY ALSO KNOWN AS CAL SERVE. THE SENATE APPROVED ONGOING FUNDING OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE CAL SERVE GATEWAY. ALONG WITH PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE ASSEMBLY TOOK NO ACTION IN THE GOVERNOR HAD NO PROPOSAL. THE LA DOES NOT TAKING A POSITION ON THIS BUT WE WOULD NOT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FOR CONTEXT. THE CAL CERVANTES WAY WAS DEVELOPED ABOUT A DECADE AGO. EN IS JOINTLY MANAGED BY THREE PARTNERS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CENTER FOR VECTOR BORNE DISEASES THAT YOU SEE DAVIS. THE DATABASE ITSELF IS HOUSED AT UC DAVIS. WHILE THE DEPARTMENT MONITORS AND OVERSEAS ACTIVITIES AND USES THE DATABASE TO GENERATE STATEWIDE REPORTS. MORE THAN SIXTY ENTITIES PRIMARILY LOCAL VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICTS. SUBMIT SURVEILLANCE DATA TO THE SYSTEM AND USE THE SYSTEM TO ASSESS. CURRENT AN IMMINENT. VECTOR BORNE DISEASE THREATS. THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY HAS NO GENERAL FUND SUPPORT IT IT RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDING PRIMARILY THROUGH TWO. GRANTS IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR WHETHER THOSE. SOURCES OF FEDERAL FUNDING WILL BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST NOTE THAT IF THIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS APPROVED IT WOULD PAY FOR TWO ADDITIONAL STAFF AT UC DAVIS AND. INCREASE THE PROGRAM'S DATA VISUALIZATION. CAPABILITIES AND RISK MAPPING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. THIS IS A LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THEY. FIVE YEARS ON THE ORANGE COUNTY VECTOR CONTROL BOARD. IN AN ORANGE COUNTY WE FOUND THAT WE HAD A. SUCH A RISE IN WEST NILE VIRUS THAT WE WOULD LIKE ONE OF THE HIGHEST. IN THE NATION AND WE WE WE DID ALL THE STUDIES. OF WHERE THE OCCURRENCES WERE AND IRONICALLY IT WAS IN THE POORER PARTS OF. SANTA ANA WHERE OUR WATER SYSTEM PIPES WERE LEVEL AND WATER WASN'T FLOWING THROUGH SO. MOSQUITOES FOR. LAYING EGGS IN FEUD OPEN A MANHOLE COVER YOU HAVE THOUSANDS COME. POPPING OUT. AND WEST NILE VIRUS SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A REACTION SOME IT KILLS. SO I THINK THIS IS WORTHWHILE BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO BE THE NUMBER ONE. IN THE NATION. ON A CERTAIN. ISSUE THAT WE CAN WORK ON SO I I'M I'M I'M. THANKFUL THAT THE SENATE IS PROPOSING THIS KIND OF INITIATIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY OBSCENE NOW WILL MOVED ISSUE THIRTY TWO VALLEY FEVER. THANK YOU AT THIS ISSUE RELATES TO RESEARCH AND OUTREACH ON VALLEY FEVER. BOTH HOUSES PROVIDED ONE MILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR VALLEY FEVER OUTREACH IN AWARENESS ACTIVITIES. HE TELLS ALSO PROVIDES FUNDING FOR RESEARCH BUT THEY DIFFER ON BOTH HOW TO SPEND. WELL HOW MUCH TO SPEND AND THEN WHO TO GIVE THE OF FUNDING TO. WELL THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH PROVIDES THREE MILLION TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE SENATE APPROACH PROVIDES TWO MILLION VIA THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO THE VALLEY FEVER INSTITUTE ACT KERN MEDICAL IN LOCATED IN BAKERSFIELD. AT THIS TIME WE WE THE ILIO LACKS. AN ANALYTIC. BASIS FOR THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF FUNDING AND WHETHER IT SHOULD BE TWO MILLION THREE MILLION SOME OTHER AMOUNT. I'M REGARDING WHO SHOULD CONDUCT THE RESEARCH ON VALLEY FEVER WE NOTE THAT EACH OF THE ENTITIES MAY USE THE FUNDING SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE A KEY PRIORITY ACT KERN MEDICAL IS TO SORT OF BUILD UP THEIR RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EXAMPLE EXPANDING ITS RESEARCH AND TREATMENT FACILITY. DEVELOPING A BLOOD AND TISSUE REPOSITORY AND BUILDING UP PHYSICIAN EXPERTISE IN TREATING VALLEY FEVER. THE U. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MEANWHILE WOULD PRIMARILY USE THE FUNDING FOR SOME VERY SPECIFIC RESEARCH PROJECTS. SUCH AS UNDERSTANDING THE MOST LETHAL FORM OF VALLEY FEVER. IN DEVELOPING A TRIAL ON ANTI FUNGAL TREATMENTS. SO YOU MAY WISH TO FACTOR THESE TYPES OF DIFFERENCES. AS THE WAITER DECISION. THANK YOU MISS COST. AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ACTION TAKEN BY BOTH HOUSES DOES NOT INCLUDE RESOURCES FOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADMINISTER THE OUTREACH AND AWARENESS PORTION. OF THE PROPOSALS WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD ADDITIONAL PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO EXPAND THE ONE TIME FUNDS OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SUFFICIENT TIME TO DEVELOP AND MONITOR CONTRACTS FOR THE PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. THANK YOU. I TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATE NIELSEN JUST IF WE COULD KEEP THE ITEM OF FOUR OH OPEN FOR THE DISCUSSION OF VOTE LATER. THANK YOU. SEVERAL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND NEW CASES. OF. THIS WEST REGISTER SHE THE VALLEY FEVER. AND THE IN KERN COUNTY. SO IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT I APPRECIATE OF THAT THERE'S AN AUGMENTATION BEING DONE FOR AND I. I SEE WHAT MAY BE MORE WISDOM IN. FOCUSING ON THE EPICENTER OF HIS PARTICULAR. ISSUE BY WITH THE CURRENT. CURRENT MEDICAL FACILITY THANK FUTURE THANK YOU. MISTER OBERNOLTE. OCT QUESTION FOR THE LA O. DOES THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE. CURRENTLY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE EXPERTISE TO ADMINISTER A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS SOME RESEARCH ACTIVITY GOING ON AT UC DAVIS AND UC MERCED. ARMS OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS SHARED WITH US. SOME OF THE. PROJECTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO. YOU HEAT IT UP UNDERTAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME. INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE UC DAVIS WE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION BEYOND THAT. WELL IT I THINK I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE THAT. THE CURRENT MEDICAL OUT MIGHT BE A MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO. PUT THIS RESEARCH AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO. MAKE A LANGUAGE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH THAT IT COULD BE EXPENDED OVER TWO YEARS. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN. MR REENTER. VALLEY BOY I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO. NOT PERSONALLY BUT THE ACQUAINTANCES AND EMPLOYEES DEAL WITH ASH AFFLICTION. SOMETIME AGO. BUT NOW I'M VERY CONVERSANT WITH WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN IN KERN COUNTY. NOT ONLY FROM A CENTER FULLER BUT FROM A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT I KNOW DOWN HERE IT IS IS VERY SERIOUS AFFLICTION THEN. AND DOES MORE DETENTION. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT TO KERN. FACILITIES SHOULD BE HANDY WHERE THE EPICENTER IS WHERE THE. FOCUS OF THE RESEARCH. THAT DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT. OKAY. THANK YOU. MOVING ON TO ISSUE THIRTY THREE. BOARD OF EQUALIZATION MEMBER STAFF IT. CAROLYN SHE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OTHER HOUSES TOOK SIMILAR ACTIONS ON THIS ITEM. SPECIFICALLY OF THE HOUSES REDUCE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BOARD õBER INDIVIDUALS STARTING IN JANUARY. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH OUR ANALYSIS. DO TO THE REDUCTION OF WORKLOAD AND I DO THE CHANGES IN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES ARE ENACTED LAST YEAR. I THE GOVERNOR HAD PROPOSED TO REDUCE BOARD. MEMBER STAFF TO EAT. THANK YOU MISS COST. I AS THE ELSE'S NOTED WE DID. SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND PRESENTED OUR FINDINGS TO THE LEGISLATURE THE ALEJO HOUSES WHILE WE FEEL THAT THE LA AND THOSE. SURVEY COMPORTS I WITH AND THE RANGE OF WHAT WE FOUND WITHIN OUR REPORT AND SO WE WOULD BE FINE WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATION AND THE ACTION ADOPTED BY BOTH HOUSES. THANK YOU. ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISSED YOUR EYES WARM MAKE SURE THAT I'M CLEAR ON THIS DIDN'T BOTH. SUB COMMITTEES BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE TAKE THE SAME POSITION ON THIS ITEM YOU SAID SIMILAR. AND SIMILAR METHODS ARE THE SAME. SIMILAR MEANS A CONFERENCE ITEM THE SAME NORMALLY DOESN'T MEAN A CONFERENCE ITEM CORRECT DNA ACTIONS WERE THE SAME OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SO OR LOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. I YOU KNOW HAVING SERVED AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR I WOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE MORE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES AND. WHAT CAN WE DO AT THIS LEVEL TO? MODIFY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TWO TO PERHAPS FOR SIX. A MEMBER CAN PROPOSE. MODIFICATION. AND HOPE. FOR A. SUPPORTIVE VOTE. AND THERE WILL BE WE COULD ACTUALLY VOTE ON IT. THIRTY IT'S LIKE RIGHT NOW OR. NOT RIGHT NOW. OKAY SORRY NO. C. WE SHOULD JUST FOLLOW YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS OR THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY NOW. IT CENTER DEALS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WOULD REQUESTED IN THIS BE A NOT AND CONFERENCE ITEM AT THE REQUEST OF THE. MEMBERS. I'M SORRY CITY GETS NOT NOT A CONFERENCE ITEM TO WE COULD WE WOULD READ VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ETCETERA. WELL MISTER CHAIR I WILL I'VE BEEN APPROACHED YOU KNOW I SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS ISSUE. BOTH LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR MUCH MORE TIME THAN I EVER ANTICIPATED AND FRANKLY MORE TIME THAN I EVER WANTED TO SPEND. OUR I HAVE BEEN APPROACHED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY. INDIVIDUALS SEEKING RELIEF FROM THE ACTIONS OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEES THAT HEARD THIS MATTER AND FRANKLY WHEN I TOLD THEM WAS YOU KNOW. WE'RE IN A TRANSITION MODE HERE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FRANKLY YOU WIND UP HAVING AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND THERE WILL BE A BCP PROCESS THAT BEGINS I IN THE FALL AND EXTENDS INTO TWO THOUSAND AND. NINETEEN IN THAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO REALLY REVISIT. WHAT YOUR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND WHETHER YOU NEED TO EXEMPTS STAFF FOR CIVIL SERVICE AND NON EXEMPT STAFF? AND FRANKLY THAT'S THE SUGGESTION THAT I MADE THEM SO I'M. A LITTLE BOTHERED BY THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING TO TALK ABOUT THIS YET AGAIN. I WILL DEAL OBVIOUSLY PERSONALLY WITH IT IF AND WHEN IT COMES BACK UP SO THAT'S MY STATEMENT ON THE SUBJECT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. SEE NO FURTHER COMMENT REMOVED ISSUE THIRTY FOUR BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT. LL FEEL FREE TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. AND I SAID AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR OP PROPOSED DEPOSITING AND FUNDS INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OF STATES RAINY DAY FUND. SO THAT IT REACHES ITS CONSTITUTIONAL MAXIMUM AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE SENATE AND GOVERNOR WOULD BOTH PUT THOSE FUNDS DIRECTLY INTO THE BSA WHEREAS THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL IS TO HOLD THESE FUNDS TEMPORARILY IN A THIRD RESERVE ACCOUNT. THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND THEN TO. TRANSFER THE FUNDS AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR FROM THE BDS AID TO THE BSI. THE CONSCRIPT. THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTS PRUDENT RESERVES WE'VE VIEWED THIS AS A CONFORMING IDEM BASED ON WHAT WE DECIDE TO DO WITH THE OVERALL RESERVE STRATEGY AS PART OF THE FINAL BUDGET. THANK YOU. SERVICE. AGAIN ON ITEM I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE. WE WE USED WITH THE. MANY WORK FOR DECADES. THE GET THE RAINY DAY FUND. NOW THIS INDIVIDUAL. NOW FUND MAY HAVE MERIT BUT I'M. WARY OF IT. I'M WONDERING IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY AROUND. THE RAINY DAY FUND WE ALREADY HAVE. AND STATUTE CONSTITUTION SO THEY ARE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT. AND I THINK IT PARTICULAR THE THE PROPOSAL WAS ON. BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE I WANTS THE RAINY DAY FUND WAS FILLED THIS WAS ANOTHER OPTION TO SAVE FURTHER MY. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN ONCE THE RAINY DAY FUND IS FILLED THE ACCESS IS SUPPOSED TO GO TO AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER AFLOAT. SO. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO RESERVE ACCOUNTS WE GOT THE BSA AND WE'VE GOT THE SFE YOU. SO THE BSA HAS A MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IT. TOO WAS ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE THE SFU DOES NOT. AND. BUT IF WE. RATHER THAN CREATING A THIRD ACCOUNT. AS THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. SUGGESTS IF WE INSTEAD JUST PUT THAT MONEY IN THE EXISTING SFE YOU WHAT WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOING HAPPY. THE CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF. YOUR FRIEND TO A SALES TAX TRIGGERS ARE. I'D I DON'T THERE'S NO CAP ON THE US IF YOU USE NO I'M QUESTIONING THE YOUTH THE NEED TO CREATE A THIRD. TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SALES TAX TRIGGERED LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT I ALSO LIKE YOU TO TALK ABOUT IF WE. WHETHER NOT WE WOULD HIT THE TRIGGER IF WE. IF WE INSTEAD PUT THAT MONEY INTO THE SFU CHART. AT SO UNDER THE CURRENT REVENUE ESTIMATES ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY. IT WOULD BE UNDER THOSE REVENUE ESTIMATES WE WHAT THE STATE WOULD NOT HIT. EITHER OF THE THRESHOLDS. ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE SALES TAX RATE IF THE SFU BOUNCE REACHES A CERTAIN SIZE. UNDER ONE OF THOSE THRESHOLDS IT'S IT'S FAIRLY CLOSE. BY AND SO YOU KNOW IF CONDITIONS CHANGE. IN THE FUTURE THEN IT COULD POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF REACHING THAT THRESHOLD BUT. UNDER THE CURRENT ESTIMATES IT THEY WOULD NOT OKAY SO TO SUMMARIZE THE REALLY ISN'T ANY REASON WHY WE NEED TO CREATE A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE CAN PUT THIS MONEY IN THE SFE YOU WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES THAT ACCURATE. BUT WHY WOULD DEFERRED TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THE POLICY MERITS OF THE PTSA BUT. I IT WOULD NOT HAVE ANY IMPACTS ON THE SALES TAX TRIGGERS UNDER THE CURRENT REVENUE ESTIMATES A THREE. OKAY BUT THANK YOU OF THE ARMY NOT OBVIOUSLY I AGREE WITH I DISAGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLIES POSITION I DON'T THINK WE NEED A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT AND. I EVEN IF WE WERE TO HIT THE TRIGGER. AND. WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE STATE SALES TAX RATE BY A QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE ACTION FOR US TO TAKE. ANY YEAR THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS. I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY FAIR TO RETURN SOME OF THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING IT AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT IF WE WERE TO EVER SPEND DOWN THAT MONEY AND DRAW ON THAT RESERVE THE SALES TAX WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO BACK UP. AS WE FELL BELOW THE TRIGGER THRESHOLD IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT THE ASSESSMENT IS MADE ANNUALLY OKAY WELL MISTER CHAIR I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE NEED A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT. ESPECIALLY IF THE REASON FOR CREATING IT WOULD BE TO AVOID REDUCING THE STATE SALES TAX RATE. THANK YOU. SCUTTLED JOB DISCUSSED YEAH OBVIOUSLY DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR AND THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS BUT JUST ONE TECHNICAL MATTER ABOUT THE PSA THE PSA IS SOMEONE OR SEVERAL OTHER. FORMULA THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET WHICH IS THAT IS DRIVEN OFF OF OUR REVENUE NUMBER AND SO WE HAVE SEVERAL TRUE UPS ON THE PSA DEPENDING ON WHERE WE LAND WITH OUR REVENUES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ASSEMBLIES AND TAT THIS TO INCLUDE THIS GUYS. MECHANIZATION TO SEE WHAT THAT FINAL NUMBER WOULD BE ON SO THAT DURING THE TRUE UP WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE BSA AND NOW IS AND. CONFORMING WITH OUR FINAL REVENUE NUMBERS. THANK YOU SEND MORE LOCKED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO WE HAVE. THE BSA THE S. F. E. YOU IN SO YOU CAN HAVE A FOUNTAIN. APPROACH SO WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE MAX YOU'D THEN OPEN THE THIRTY CAL. AND SO I LIKE THE IDEA MORE SAVING. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SO I'M. I'M NOT NEGATIVE TO THIS IDEA SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT. IS THIS GOOD FISCAL PRUDENCE OR IS IT A A A INDIAN RUN. SO THAT WERE DOING WHAT THE TAXPAYERS WANT US TO DO BUT WERE ALSO BEING SMART BUT POWER HANDLING OF. A FINANCES. I THINK ITS IT EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO. I ENCOURAGE MORE SAVING BY THE STATE. SO I'M WONDERING INSTEAD OF A THIRTY CAL. WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT THE MONEY INTO THE? PENSION PLAN. AS A PREPAYMENT WHICH WHEN YOU. NEED THE MONEY YOU'RE JUST REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT TO THE. PENSION PLAN AT A LATER YEAR BUT AT LEAST FOR MAKING THE WHAT SEVEN PERCENT ON YOUR MONEY. AND THEN YOU STILL HONOR THE THRESHOLDS. AGAIN AS A LEGISLATURE WE COULD PROPOSE AND ANY PARTICULAR AYE BUT THAT'S NOT ITEM TYPE. BEFORE SO WE'RE DISCUSS. YOU'RE WELCOME. MOVING ON TO ISSUE THIRTY FIVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. BRIAN BROWN ANALYST'S OFFICE A. THE GOVERNMENT MAY REVISION INCLUDED JUST OVER A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE TWENTY PLUS DEPARTMENT. THERE REALLY TWO ISSUES BEFORE YOU IN CONFERENCE FIRST IS THE FUNDING AMOUNT ITSELF. THE SENATE APPROVED THE FULL FUNDING PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION WHERE THE ASSEMBLY REDUCE THE GENERAL FUND AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE SECOND ISSUE IS ACCOUNTABILITY RELATED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ADOPTED BY THE SENATE. THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WAS IN RESPONSE TO SOME CONCERNS RAISED. REGARDING ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL AND INCLUDING THAT DESPITE THIS BEING A VERY LARGE PROPOSAL THERE IS ACTUALLY A LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS BE. UNDERTAKEN WITH THIS BILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS. SOME CONCERN THAT NOT ALL THE PROJECTS SEEM TO BE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND THAT THE PROCESS ITSELF THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD WORK TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. HAVE A COUPLE OF PIECES BUT WOULD. REQUIRE MORE CLEAR DEFINITION OF WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS IN THE UNDERTAKEN WITH THIS FUNDING AS WELL AS INCREASE SOME REPORTING CRIME AS THE LEGISLATURE. WE RECOMMEND SORT OF A COMPROMISE PROPOSAL GIVEN SOME THESE CONCERNS I I SHOULD SAY WE HAVE AT THE OFFICE. THINK THE INEFFICIENT SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR. PUTTING MORE FUN AND AS THEY'VE DONE IN SEVERAL RECENT YEARS TOWARDS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND MAINTAINING A STATE ASSET BUT GIVEN SOME THESE CONCERNS RAISED WE THINK AN APPROACH OF TAKING THE ASSEMBLY FUNDING LEVEL OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN THE FULL BILLION. AS WELL AS THE SENATE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WOULD BE. REGIONAL APPROACH AS WELL AS FREE UP SOME ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND MONEY FOR OTHER PRIORITIES. THANK YOU DISCUSSED. WE SUPPORT THE SENATE AMOUNT THAT WAS ADOPTED ON THE ISSUE OF THE LANGUAGE WE WOULD JUST KNOW THAT ARE PROPOSAL'S IDENTICAL ON A TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS AGREED TO AN IMPROVED AND AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. WHICH PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS LETTUCE LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION OF THE FINAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS FOR EACH DEPARTMENT PRIOR TO ALLOCATION OF ANY FUNDS AND A THIRTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD. FOR COMMENTS QUARTERLY NOTIFICATION REGARDING ANY CHANGES TO THE INITIALLY APPROVED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LESS FROM THE DEPARTMENTS. AND THIRTY DAY PRIOR. SEES ME THIRTY DAY NOTICE PRIOR TO ADDING ANY PROJECT WITH ESTIMATED COSTS GREATER THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU. ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE ACTUALLY HEARD THIS ITEM IN THE SENATE SO. BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON STATE ADMINISTRATION. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR WHATEVER WE CALL OURSELVES. THE. THE SIZE OF THE OF THE THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY WAS OF INTEREST WHAT WAS OF MORE INTEREST WAS THE A CONTINUED APPROPRIATION NATURE. OF OF THE AS I RECALL OF THE EXPENDITURE. WASN'T AND IS IN THIS A WAVES IS THE SAME ONE THAT I HEARD WHERE YOU HAD THE LAUNDRY LIST OF PROJECTS WITHOUT SPECIFICITY IS IS A DIFFERENT ONE. CHRIS SLEEPS PARTNER FINANCE YET THAT THIS SO FUNDING CAME WITH THREE YEARS OF AVAILABILITY FOR FOR THE FUNDS BUT I MEAN THIS IS THE LAUNDRY LIST OF PROJECTS FOR RESTORE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAN WE MOVED DOWN. SO THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC PROJECTS LISTED THERE WAS NO TRIAGE IN YOUR PROJECTS. UNLIKE WHAT WE DID IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SACRAMENTO AREA PROJECTS. WHERE WE TALKED WHERE WE SPOKE ABOUT IT? AYE I THINK IT. YOUR. YOU MAY BE CONFUSING THE PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FUND WITH THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALLOCATION ALWAYS IS DIFFERENT SO SO THIS IS. THE SAME APPROACH WE USE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. TWO YEARS AGO. THEN MAYBE I AM TO IT'S NORMAL AND I'M COULD WE'VE HAD THAT WERE PROPOSALS RGARDING STATE BUILDINGS WHICH IS I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING THIS IS FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OUR PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK PREVIOUSLY WHICH ALLOWS FOR. THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT BEFORE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. WELL I GUESS I COULD GET TO THE ME SPEAK TO THE JOY THAT'S THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. OKAY I'M THE ONE TO RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AT THE TIME. I WAS NOT TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WERE I GUESS I'M GETTING THE POINT REGARDLESS OF WHICH ONE OF THESE IT IS WE HEARD SEVERAL. I WAS NOT TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE WAY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WORKED AT THE TIME. I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN INFORMED ABOUT THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS. THE WAY THAT PROCESS WORKS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE MODIFIED THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD A LITTLE BIT IN THE IN THE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED AND I'M. COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TOO. A BECAUSE I WHAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE HAPPENED WAS THAT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ITS CHAIR WHOEVER THAT IS AT THE TIME. HAVE THE ABILITY TO PUT THE BRAKES ON. PROJECTS WHEN WE WERE NOT SPECIFICALLY INFORMED. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAGE ING AND HAD A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO WHICH PROJECTS WERE PUT ON THE LIST. AND MY NOW AM I ON THE SAME PAGE WITH YOU WELL AS TO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AND SUBCOMMITTEE YES OKAY SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT. WE RAISE THE ISSUE AYE MUCH LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS AT THIS POINT AND SO. I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THEM. AND FRANKLY OF WHICHEVER. PROCESS IT IS IF WE WIND UP WITH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SUMMER LOCK. SURE I. SHE THE ASSEMBLY. RECOMMENDATION HAS TEN MILLION. DOLLARS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT FUNDS FOR AGRICULTURAL FAIRS FOR CAL EXPO. WHICH WE ALREADY COVERED ON THIS IS THE ESSAY MY THEM THAT WE WERE TO COVER. THAT THE TEN MILLION FOR CAL EXPO. SO SINCE WE WERE DISCUSSING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT. THIS ITEM WAS ALSO JUST MENTIONED THAT THIS IS WE HAD ALREADY DISCUSSED THE ITEM PREVIOUSLY BUT FEEL BUT FEEL FREE ONE GUY JUST A CARE JUST AS LONG AS MY THOUGHTS ON A CLEAR FIVE. I'M JUST CROSSED BUT MISTER CHAIR SO. SO THAT WE DISCUSSED THIS EARLIER BUT WE TOOK IT WE TALK ABOUT A CD FAA. STUDY BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND I'M JUST CURIOUS. DOES ANYONE IS ANYONE HERE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT STUDY. AB JUST. WHAT WHERE MY COLLEAGUE JOHN MARTIN MENTIONED EARLIER SO THAT WAS A STUDY DONE A FEW YEARS AGO TO ASSESS THE TOTAL? ESTIMATED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEED ACROSS THE THE FAIRS. I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS OFF TAUGHT MY HEAD BUT. THE IT WHICH WE DISCUSSED AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE THE SHARE OF THAT THAT WAS PACIFIC TAKALIK BILL AND THAT'S HOW IT CAME UP IN THAT CONTEXT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS INFORMED US THAT THEY THINK THAT REPORT OF THE LITTLE BIT OUTDATED AT THIS TIME SO THEY PROBABLY WANT TO GO OUT AND DO ANOTHER ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE WIDE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS ARE AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL EXPO. FOR THE INFORMATION I HAVE ON THAT STUDY WAS THAT IT WAS. COMMISSIONED QUICKLY. THAT IT WAS A RUSHED THROUGH THAT IT ASKED EVERY FAIR GROUNDS FOR JUST THREE CAPITAL PROJECTS. AND IF THEY HAD TWO WEEKS TO TURN IT AROUND. SO I THINK YOUR SUGGESTION OF DOING ANOTHER STUDY MIGHT BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. OKAY OBSCENE NO OTHER QUESTIONS ITEM THIRTY SIX WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE. MISS COSTA PRESENT. ABSOLUTELY I'D LIKE TO OFFER A CONFERENCE COMPROMISE. THE THE START WITH THE HISTORY TRADING OF THE BEST A LITTLE MORE LIKE A VERY EXCITED THIS IS GOOD. WE HAVE A PROVISION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES BUDGET THAT SPECIFIES HOME BY ENTITY THE NUMBER OF HARD COPIES THAT WE PROVIDE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO MULTIPLE ENTITIES INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE. THE HISTORY OF THAT PROVISION IS THAT FOR THE. TWO THOUSAND FOUR FIVE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID NOT PROVIDE HARD COPIES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PUBLICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE OR LEGISLATIVE STAFF. INSTEAD WE PROVIDED THOSE OFFICES WITH THE CD ROM. THIS FORMAT CHANGE WAS. NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO THEY ADDED PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING. SPECIFIED QUANTITIES BE DELIVERED TO THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR BUDGET PROVISION. HISTORICALLY WHEN WE PROVIDED THESE COPIES FOR THE LEGISLATURE WE ONLY INCLUDED COPIES FOR THE RELEVANT BUDGET STAFF. BUT AS TIME HAS GONE ON POLICY STAFF OF ALSO AND AND COMMITTEE STAFF REQUESTED A HARD COPIES RELEVANT TO THEIR ASSIGNMENTS. AND SO WE'D LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT WE ACTUALLY DELETE THIS PROVISION IN OUR BUDGET AND WORK WITH EACH RESPECTIVE CAUCUS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE NUMBER OF HARD COPIES THAT EACH CAUCUS REQUEST. BIGGEST SECOND. SO IF THERE'S NO OBJECTION TO. TO MY HEARING FIVE OO FIVE OO. ON THE CONFERENCE COMPROMISE. WE. BOND. UNDER THE OCEAN. I WAVED WITH RELUCTANCE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ALMOST SILLY THAT THIS ISSUE THIS ONE THING WE'RE VOTING ON OF THE FOUR FIVE AND NOW WE'RE. VOTE NON NUMBERS OF DOCUMENTS BUT BY GOSH IF THE. PEOPLE OUT THERE WATCHING THIS MUST THINK THIS PLACE IS A LUNATIC ASYLUM. THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOTE IT'S A REALLY GOOD DOCUMENT. AND IN THAT IT WAS NOT MY CAUCUS WHO MADE THE REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL. COPIES OF THE BUDGET I I WON'T RESCIND MY MOTION BUT I WILL SAY THAT OUR SITE IS FIVE. ZERO. WE ARE FORCED BY ZERO FOUR ZERO. ISSUE THIRTY SEVEN PRECISION MEDICINE LA OUT. THAT'S THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRECISION MEDICINE FUNDING BOTH HOUSES AUGMENTED THE GOVERNOR'S THIRTY. I TWELVE MILLION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE YOU SEE. DAVIS INSTITUTE FOR REGENERATIVE CURES. THE SENATE'S TWELLMAN AUGMENTATIONS NOT REFLECTED IN YOUR AGENDA AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT WAS TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT AVENUE. PACIFIC COOLEY US THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'D THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTIONS IN THE HOUSES EYES THEIR RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW NONPROFIT INSTITUTE. I TO ADVANCE PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE THAT WOULD. ADMINISTER THE ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDS FOR FOR PRECISION PER FOR PRECISION MEDICINE. THE SENATE ADOPTED A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. A THE ASSEMBLY REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE AN INSTITUTE. AND WOOD INSTEAD HAVE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. ALLOCATED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAS AS HAS BEEN DONE WITH PASSED AROUND THE FUNDING FOR PRECISION MEDICINE. ASSEMBLIES APPROACH WE DON'T SEE A A COMPELLING REASON TO CREATE. A A IN IT A NEW INSTITUTE ó AND THERE IS SOME RISK INVOLVED IN CREATING SENDING UP A NEW ENTITY WITH ONE TIME FUNDING. OTHER WHEN THE FUNDING RUNS OUT YOU HAVE THIS ENTITY IN A BOARD AND STAFF THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED COULD GREAT SOME FUTURE BUDGET PRESSURES. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SUGGESTED THAT. THE PLAN WOULD BE TO HAVE THE INSTITUTE'S ONGOING OPERATIONS BE FUNDED FROM PRIVATE DONATIONS. BUT HASN'T PERFORMED ANY EVIDENCE OR PLAN OTHER THEY COULD. SECURE RELIABLE PRIVATE FUNDING TO DO SO. THANK YOU MISS COST. THANK YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT EITHER HOUSES RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM WE KNOW THAT THE SENATE SUNSET DATE COMPLICATES LONG TERM I PLANNING AND COMPLEX WITH THAT PERIOD OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BUDGET LANGUAGE FURTHER IS THE ALICE NOTED. PART OF OUR PROPOSAL IS THAT WE'RE CREATING A NEW GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IN A SUNSET DATE REALLY COMPLICATE THOUGHT PROCESS. WE ARE HAVE. WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY ACTION THAT INCLUDES THE UC DAVIS AYE INSTITUTE ON MOSTLY BECAUSE I WE HAVE A PEER REVIEW MODEL AND THE PRECISION MEDICINE WORLD SO WE'RE JUST NOT SURE IT'S A GOOD MATCH. OBVIOUSLY IT'S WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS OF THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM. WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTION TO DENY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INSTITUTE. ON BECAUSE. IN RECENT HISTORY WE'VE BEEN PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THIS ACTION AND WERE REALLY PUTTING FORTH A GOVERNANCE MODEL THAT WE HOPE WILL INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PROFICIENT. PRECISION MEDICINE GOING FORWARD AND BETTER INTEGRATE THE SUCCESSFUL PRACTICES I HAD DETERMINED INTO THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WITHOUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHARGES TWO QUICK QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS. IT'S IT UNDER ISSUE THIRTY SEVEN PRECISION MEDICINE IT SAYS SECRETARY OF STATE AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN? THE TYPE OF. ALL QUE I WIN. I'M SECOND QUESTION IS. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION SEVENTY ONE WHICH WAS THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE FOR. REGENERATIVE MEDICINE IT WAS. ACRONYM ASCII R. M. TERM. AND THEY ISSUED THREE BILLION IN BONDS. TO DO. STEM CELL RESEARCH AND THEY BROUGHT IT UP JUST BUT I THINK THAT NOW WE SHOULD ALL THAT ALL THE BONDS BUT. BUT THEY'D GOTTEN NO MONEY LITERALLY NO MONEY MAYBE A HUNDRED SEVEN NINE THOUSAND. IN ROYALTIES RESIDUALS AT TO PAY DOWN THAT DEBT SO I THINK IN. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE MIGHT BE SEEING A PAYMENT OF SOME SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO PAY. ON THIS PARTICULAR BOND THAT'S NOW BEING UNDERWRITTEN BY THE TAXPAYER SO. I I'M I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE'RE HERE WHY DID INSERM. YOU KNOW PROVIDE THE RESEARCH WE'VE ALREADY INVESTED THREE BILLION OR PAINT SIX BILLION. TO PAY IT OFF. EITHER THE GENERAL FUND AND I JUST I. I I'M JUST LIKE KINDA JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. REYES TAXPAYER DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY IN IT ANYBODY ORDER TAKER. SKINNER MOVED TO. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING OUR BOND FUNDS OBVIOUSLY PRECISION MEDICINE AND WE'VE HAD. OF SEVERAL RECENT BUDGET FOR THEIR ONE TIME DOLLARS A THINK ANY TIME I WHICH USED TO PROVIDE LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS ARE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES FUNDING FOR RESEARCH. THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOU KNOW THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT YOU GENERATED FROM THOSE ENDEAVORS ALMONDS I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE PRECISION MEDICINE A SEPARATE APART FROM SOME OF THE RESEARCH PROPOSALS WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE AGENDA. I DON'T CARE MANAGERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS A CORE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS. IT IN TERMS OF WHAT I'M SORRY MAMA WHAT IT WILL. WE'RE NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF DOING THIS SO I'M. WONDER WHY WERE WERE FUNDING THIRTY MILLION IN THE GOVERNOR'S. A PROPOSAL AND AND AND FORTY TWO MILLION THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. I DON'T GET IT I DON'T. WHERE WERE NOT JUST AS A FREE MARKETPLACE? TRYING TO FIND CURES AND AND DO THINGS BUT I I DON'T SEE WHY WE'RE SPENDING MONEY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE. SENSIBLE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WE'VE GOT AN EXAMPLE OF HOW. WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN THAT THEY'D NOTHING FOR THREE BILLION? DOLLARS PLUS INTEREST. MAYBE A MAKING. MAYBE I'M MAKING AN ARGUMENT. AGAINST THIS BUT I. I'M JUST TRYING TO. GET AN ANSWER OF OF WHY ARE WE IN THAT SWEETNESS COSTS GO TO TRY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SO MAYBE SOMEONE GIVE ME A REPORT I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR I DON'T KNOW POLITICS. I I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT EVERY NOTE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED ENTITY. AND THAT ONE OF THEIR CORE MISSIONS IS THE CREATION OF NEW KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS AFFECTION WAITED THROUGH RESEARCH. SENATE MITCHELL. I THINK I WAS GOING TO CITE THE EXAMPLE OF THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO ALSO THE BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FUND. THAT OPERATES OUT OF OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT DEBTS ANYWAY SO I'M I'M I'M I'M CURIOUS ABOUT. YOUR PROPOSAL MISS COSTA AND SO IF YOU CAN THAT SO THE CREATION OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE TO ADVANCE PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE. IS AN EXPECTATION THAT WOULD HAVE ON GOING PUBLIC. DOLLARS. JUST OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE A NOTE THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY IT IS A NONPROFIT ENTITY AND. WOULD BE. OPERATED OR OPERATIONAL BASED ON A PRIVATE DONATIONS GOING FORWARD WE DID INCLUDE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR. UNSPENT FUNDS TO DATE TO BE. CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE INSTITUTE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF STANDING UP BUT IT'S ENVISIONED TO BE KIND OF A A SELF SUSTAINING. PRE COMPETITIVE SPACE FOR IDEAS TO COME TOGETHER. AND SO YOUR ISSUE WITH THE SENATE PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE IT INCLUDES A SUNSET. CORRECT WHICH IS ALSO. CREATES A NONPROFIT SPINOFF CORRECT. CORRECT THE THE CONCERN WITH THE SENATE PROPOSAL IS THE SUNSET DATE AND I'M EVEN MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SUNSET DATE. COMING BEFORE THE END OF AVAILABILITY OF THE THE FUNDS THEMSELVES YEAH. THANK YOU. ETCETERA. WELL YOU KNOW. WE HEARD THIS TO AND PERHAPS AND CONFUSED ABOUT THIS ONE AS WELL BUT. I I'VE WAS NEVER INITIALLY A SUPPORTER OF PRECISION MEDICINE IS THOSE I'VE BEEN CONVINCED THAT IT'S I GUESS HERE TO STAY. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THIS PROPOSAL. IS THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS. S. THING. STANDING UP ON ITS OWN. A AND THEN MOVING OFF OF THE. PUBLIC PAYROLL SO TO SPEAK AND INTO THE MAINSTREAM SO THAT IT CAN SOLICIT. A PRIVATE DONATIONS TO FURTHER THIS RESEARCH WHICH FRANKLY IS WHERE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE AYE. I HAVE BECOME A CONVERT ON THE. ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE STATE SOME HOUSE AND SOMETIMES NEEDS TO SEED RESEARCH AND. I BECOME A CONVERT ON PRECISION MEDICINE I DO THINK THERE'S. THIS SEED MEDICINE SHOULD BE ENOUGH AND HOPEFULLY THIS INSTITUTE WILL STAND UP ON ITS OWN. I'M I'M I AM CONVINCED I'M HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ON THE SUNSET DATE MYSELF AT THIS POINT SO. WE SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT DURING THE THE CONFERENCE PROCESS. THANK YOU MISTER BOB. THANK YOU. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. ON. JUST JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC TO CREATE A. NEW INSTITUTE YOU HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN ADMINISTERING. THESE FUNDS. THEY SEEMED FULLY EQUIPPED WITH MANAGING THESE FUNDS AS WELL AS DOING THE RESEARCH COULD YOU. HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT PROBLEM HAS ARISEN THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE TO CREATE A. COMPLETELY NEW BUREAUCRACY TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS. I THINK UP A LOT OF IT REALLY GOES TOWARDS. CREATING A SELF SUSTAINING. ENVIRONMENT GOING FORWARD WHERE THIS CAN CONTINUE BEYOND ONE TIME. ONETIME AUGMENTATIONS AND I THINK. TO DATE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON SOME OF THE. RESEARCH PROJECTS AND THE ON ONE TIME. AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE A ONE TIME FUNDING HAS BEEN MET WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS IN AND. MATCHES SO WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN A FUNDING THIS FROM ALTERNATIVE SOURCES SOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND THINK THAT THERE'S A. SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO CALIFORNIA TO IT TO DOING SO. UT YOU HAVE PHAM. A SITUATION WE HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY. ON. RAISES FUNDS GETS AUGMENTATIONS. THEY ALSO QUITE. USE TO RAISING ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR THEIR. FURTHER RESEARCH TO WHY HAVE A NEW BUREAUCRACY VERSUS JUST LEAVING IT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. UNLESS IT DOES IT WOULD SEEM TO BE. AND NOT THE BEST USE OF A START UP FUNDS. I THINK. IN ADDITION. IT GOES BACK TO A LITTLE OF WHAT OF WHAT WE MENTION IN TERMS OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE NONPROFIT ENTITY AND THE. ABILITY TO BRING. TOGETHER IDEAS. THIS IS. REALLY AN AREA WHERE. THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION IN TERMS OF CONSTANTLY. INNOVATING AND. WE THINK THAT THIS NONPROFIT ENTITY AND THAT STRUCTURE WILL FACILITATE THE SHARING OF IDEAS ACROSS DIFFERENT ON HEALTH INDUSTRIES. ON. AND CREATE THAT THAT SELF SUSTAINING MODEL. I AM I AM JUST NO I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO REFLECT SOME OF THE ON GOING DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR I'VE BEEN IN CONFERENCE THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED AND SO WE REALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT NEW. GOVERNANCE MODEL ON THAT WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF OUT IN THE STATE. I'D KNOW THAT I'M IN THE TIME WE'VE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR PRECISION MEDICINE MEDICINE THEY HAVE MADE FINDINGS IN THE AREAS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER ACUTE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. HYPERTENSION DEPRESSION PROSTATE CANCER GENETIC DISORDERS DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY STROKE HEART DISEASE AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. SO THE WORK THEY'RE DOING IS REALLY INNOVATIVE AND WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT FEEDBACK I MEAN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S IN CONFERENCE EVERY YEAR TO. IS. THE DEPARTMENT GONNA PROPOSE SPINNING OFF A GOOD CHUNK OF THE UNIVERSITY INTO A PRIVATE NONPROFIT TO DO RESEARCH IS THAT WHERE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS. MY POINT SIMPLY WAS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REFLECT WHAT WE HEARD AND CONFERENCE WHICH WAS AND. AND UNCOMFORTABLE LESS WITH IT BEING WITHIN A STATE ENTITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED THIS NEW GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE. SENATE MITCHELL. I AS YOU REYES OF THE ROLE OF YOU SEE I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE ADMIN RATE IF WHAT YOU THINK THE ADMIN RIGHT WOULD BE FOR THIS NEW ORGANIZATION. AND PREPARE TO ADD ME RIGHT FOR YOU SEE WHEN THEY DO THESE. INDIVIDUALIZED RESEARCH. WE DON'T HAVE THAT SENATOR MITCHELL BUT WE'LL GET BACK TO WITH THE COMPARISON THANK. ETCETERA. I DON'T REMEMBER THE ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS SO I'LL ASK YOU TO HOPEFULLY IT'S AN INTELLIGENT ONE. WITH RESPECT TO THE OF THIS WAS ADMINISTERED. OUT OF FOAM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. SO THE. THE GRANT AWARDS WERE THEY JUST TO UC INSTITUTIONS IN THE PASTOR OF THE GOING TO WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ISSUED. TWO OTHER. ENTITIES. DO YOU KNOW CENTER I BELIEVE THE THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE ROUNDS OF FUNDING I THINK AS YOU RECALL. AB TWO ROUNDS OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS THE FIRST ROUND WAS ALL TO YOU SEE I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND ROUND INCLUDED YOU SEE AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. WHICH OF COURSE I MEAN I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER FOR THIS OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT COULD. MITIGATE TOWARD ESTABLISHING A NONPROFIT SO THAT ELIMINATES THE. CONCERN THAT UC'S SIMPLY FUNDING UC'S OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS AND NOT THE EFFORTS OF OTHER. OF PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU KNOW COULD PERHAPS FURTHER THE. BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS EFFORT. A IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST ASK ONE OTHER QUESTION ON THE NOT IS THIS IS THIS THE CREATION OF THIS NONPROFIT INSTITUTE IS IS TRULY A NONPROFIT IT'S NOT ONE OF THESE STATE QUASE I. ORGANIZATIONS ISN'T. AND IF THE ANSWER IS NO. I'M CLIP OF THE REASON I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE SUNSET IS I'M NOT EXACTLY HOW WE SUNSET A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT CORPORATION. THEY'RE PROBABLY A FEW THAT WE COULD WORK ON BUT. IT IS A NON PROFIT AND THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ATTACHED TO THE PROPOSAL. ALSO INCLUDES AN A AD ABOARD OVERSIGHT WITH THE AND DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH SERVING ON THE BOARD AND I AM. ADDITIONAL MEMBERS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT IS ENVISIONED AS A NON PROFIT. NO I SEE I SEE HOW WE. SUNSET IT THEN WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO BE OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO BE APPOINTING THE BOARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SAID I THINK I AM. MY AND MY CONCERN WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT STRUCTURE IS. GIVEN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESEARCH THAT THE UNIVERSITY CURRENTLY DOES THROUGH A VARIETY OF ITEMS MANY OF THEM IN THE SCIENCE AREA. AYE IT'S. NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY THIS PARTICULAR ITEMS GETTING SPUN OFF AND WHY NOT OTHER ITEMS. PERHAPS. IF THIS IS AN AREA OF INTEREST LEGISLATURE IT WE SHOULD BE. TAKING A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW OF ALL SCIENCE RESEARCH WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY WHICH IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF THERE IS A CONCERN OUT OF MINISTRY OF STRUCTURE WHAT. WHAT I WOULD SAY OR JUST ARMY ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IS AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO THERE IS A MODEL CALLED QB THREE IT'S BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL? ITEM BEEN EMBRACED BY THE OUR PRIVATE SECTOR YET REMAINS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HAS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AUTONOMY AYE DOCTOR REG KELLY'S BEEN IN CHARGE OF IT AND IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THAT MODEL IF YOU IF YOU ACTUALLY VISITED AND MANY LEGISLATORS. HAVE HAVE VISITED ON THE SPACE IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL A LABORATORY THAT LOOKS MUCH LIKE A TIME INCUBATOR IN OUR PRIVATE SECTOR BIOTECH ENVIRONMENT IT'S BEEN EMBRACED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT YET HAS A VERY LEAN AND MEAN ON ADMINISTRATIVE ARM FUNCTION WHICHIS WHY I THINK IT'S ALSO BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL YET. ON HOUSE OF MUCH OF THE TOWN. SECURITY OF THE UNIVERSITY AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO REALLY THRIVE SUCH SPINS REALLY SEEN AS A MODEL. AND. BIOTECH SPACE AS A. VERY STRONG. PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE I REALLY. BLEW LOOK TO THAT AS POTENTIAL MODEL RATHER THAN A WHOLE NEW. BUREAUCRATIC CON FUNCTION. THEN WITHOUT WILL MOVE TO ISSUE THIRTY EIGHT CENTS US ARMY. AND THE SENATOR BAUCUS IS NOT SECRETARY OF STATE IS ANOTHER TYPE OF. IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. SEC SENATOR MORE LIKE OUR JUSTICE A THERE'S A TYPO ON THIS ONE AS WELL. ISSUE THIRTY. THE IT'S ALSO NOT SECRETARY OF STATE. LA HEALTH CARE LAUNCHER AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. FORTY MILLION DOLLARS I GENERAL FUND. FOUR SENSES OUT REACH FOR THE COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEE OVER THREE YEARS. I THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BOTH AUGMENTED THESE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFICALLY ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION. POINT A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION FOR SENSE AS I REACH OVER THREE YEARS THE ASSEMBLY ALSO INCLUDED OF REPORTING LANGUAGE REGARDING THE COMPLETE CAO COMMITTEES ACTIVITIES. INCLUDING. A LANGUAGE ACCESS STRATEGY. THE SENATE ADOPTED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT THREE MILLION OVER THREE YEARS BUT DID NOT INCLUDE ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THANK YOU MISS COST. THIS IS A GENERAL FUND LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU ARE TO THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEE. SEE KNOW OUR COMMENTS ISSUE THIRTY NINE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WILDFIRE DEGREE MISTER CHAIR. I'D SO REMARKABLE RESEARCH. AND. THE AT THE NINETEEN NINETY CENSUS ACTUALLY COST THE STATE I THINK OVER TWO BILLION. IN UNDER CAL ARTS AND SO I WAS ASKING A QUESTION WOULD AND I. SWELLED UP PLEASE PASS THAT ALONG NO I I THINK I THINK YOUR ON. CONCERT IS VERY WELL HEELED AND I THINK THAT'S WHY. WE ARE ON. TRY TO DETERMINE THEIR. ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING I THINK COME. WILL HAVE A LOT AT STAKE IF OUR POPULATION IS UNDER COUNTED WHETHER IT'S IN TERMS OF. REPRESENTATION HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES WHAT THERE'S THROUGH ALL THE FORMULAS A FEDERAL FUNDING DO YOU THINK WE COULDN'T BE. AND MORE AND MORE AGREEMENT WITH US SO WE ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN ACCURATE COUNT. THERE WAS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN NINETEEN NINETY THAT WERE REFERRED TO THE NINETEEN NINETY CENSUS AND. MADE OF ARE UP A PRETTY DETAILED ANALYSIS OF HOW MUCH THE STATE LOST IN FUNDING BY THE UNDERCOUNT SO I. I JUST. IT'S CRITICALLY WHAT WHAT'S THE COST BENEFIT RATIO AND AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A SIZEABLE. THAT THAT THE THE BENEFITS ARE ON. VERY LARGE AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THAT. ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REALLY BASED ON. HOW MUCH MONEY COULD WILL BE PLACED IN? HOW MUCH EFFORT COULD BE ACTUALLY EXECUTED FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE MONIES PROPERLY SPENT BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE UPSET RIGHT THAT THE STAKES? IN THE COST BENEFIT ARE ARE HUGE. WITHOUT THE DEPARTMENT FILE TYPE AWAY OWN ISSUE THIRTY NINE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE DEBRIS. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. BRIAN BROWN ANALYST'S OFFICE ISSUE THIRTY NINE IS A PROPOSAL FOR FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO COVER LOCAL SHARE OF COSTS FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL FOLLOWING THE DECEMBER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES. THE IT WORTH NOTING THAT MAY REVISION INCLUDED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SIMILAR COVERING OF LOCAL COST SHARED FOR THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES OF THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT THOUGH. ON HISTORICALLY THE STATE DOESN'T ALWAYS A COVER THESE BECAUSE IT DOES SOUND OF A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. THINK AT THE TIME OF DEVELOPING THE MAY REVISE AYE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE DECEMBER WILD FIRES AND MUD SLIDES HAD NOT YET REQUESTED A WAIVER OF THEIR LOCAL SHARE OF COSTS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE. WE NOW KNOW THE LATEST ESTIMATE OF THE LOCAL COSTA SHARE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES IS APPROXIMATELY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ESTIMATES ARE STILL SUBJECT TO SOME UNCERTAINTY AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION WE DO SUPPORT INCLUDING THESE COST. SO WE'RE HEARING ANOTHER CONFERENCE COMPROMISE. WE WERE GOING TO GET OUT. YES FIDO. ABOUT FIVE FIVE OO FIVE OO THANK YOU. WITH THAT WILL MOVE TO. ISSUE FORTY OTHER INVESTMENTS. BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA JOH. THIS ITEM HAS AN ASSORTMENT OF IN AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS I'LL RUN THROUGH THEM ONE BY ONE A THE ASSEMBLY APPROVED UP ONGOING FUNDING TO INCREASE PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE RATES. ARE ON THE SENATE SIDE THERE. THEY USE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDING TO INCREASE TARA PROVIDE A SAY THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND UP THAT WOULD BE ON AN ON GOING BASIS ACCORDING TO THE SENATE'S ACTION. NEXT THIS THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDED SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM. THE SENATE TOOK NO ACTION ON THIS ITEM AND THEN THE ASSEMBLY. ADOPTED FOSTER PARENT RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT. TRAILER BILL WE ACTUALLY COVER THIS ISSUE EARLIER IN ISSUE TWENTY NINE I BELIEVE. IT'S RELATED AT LEAST THIS TRAILER BILL THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE ASSEMBLY. WOULD EXPAND WHAT THE ALLOWABLE USES OF THE FUNDING SOMEWHAT. AND PROVIDE GOD PROVIDE SOME CHANGES FOR. THE PERIOD THIS A CITY FAR I HOW OFTEN COUNTIES ACTUALLY HAVE TO SUBMIT PLANS AND SO FORTH FOR SPENDING THE FUNDING. AYE SENATE DID NOT APPROVE TRAILER BILL ON THAT ITEM WOULD WOULD YOU ALSO LIKE ME TO RUN THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THERE NODDING CONFERENCE BUT THERE NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS AS ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION. ADVOCATE BY THAT SHOT REPUBLIC. OKAY FIRST. THE. THERE A PROPOSAL WOULD FOOT PROVIDE THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE WORK WORKING WARDROBES PROGRAM I BELIEVE THIS WOULD BE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR VETERANS. NEXT. PROVIDE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. VERTICAL PROSECUTION THEN I'LL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR THE OTHER ITEM. I THINK YOU KENNETH COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE ALSO THE LARGEST ITEM. THAT IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS HIGHER AND RETAIN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. AND I TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT. MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT IS THE LARGEST PROPOSAL. SO THOSE ADDITIONAL PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE WOULD BE INTENDED TO ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM PROVIDING ADDITIONAL COUNSELING AND THERAPY FOR STUDENTS HELPING FAMILIES ENGAGE WITH TEACHERS. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD ADMINISTER THOSE. FUNDS AS A COMPETITIVE GRANT. THAT THIS ITEM WILL BE PART OF YOUR OVERALL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. SO JUST A FEW THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. A FIRST IT'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS I DISTRICTS NOT TODAY SPEND ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PER YEAR IN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SO THIS WOULD BE ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE ON A ONE TIME BASIS. THE PROPOSAL I SINCE IT IS FOR ONE TIME FINDS YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WAYS TO STRETCH THAT FUNDING OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. THAT COULD INCLUDE PERHAPS CLARIFYING THAT FUNDING I DISTRICTS COULD DRIVE DOWN OVER MULTIPLE YEARS A PERHAPS REQUIRING A PLAN FOR DISTRICTS TO RETAIN THOSE. ADDITIONAL HIRES AFTER THE GRANT HANDS. AND THEN FINALLY YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT INCLUDING. IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC GOALS AFTER THE GRANTS TO INCLUDE THOSE IN YOUR AND. IMPLEMENTING LANGUAGE SO IF YOU WANTED A DISTRICTS TO REALLY PRIORITIZE A DISTANT MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING HE MIGHT WANNA INCLUDE THAT IN THE. PLANTING LANGUAGE I WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I THINK YOU MISS CONSTANTLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A TACKLE MY COMMENTS BY FUNDS SOURCE AMONGST THE PROPOSAL'S I'LL START WITH THE PEDIATRIC DAY HEALTH CARE RE INCREASE. THE SENATE APPROVED EIGHT MILLION PROP FIFTY SIX FOR THIS PURPOSE. FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE THINK THAT COSTS ARE UNDER ESTIMATED ON THAT AND SENATE'S ACTION. IN WE BELIEVE THEM TO BE APPROXIMATE FOUR POINT NINE MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION AYE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I WOULD NOTE ON THAT SAME ITEM ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE ON THE UTILIZED. AT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE ESTIMATE AS WELL WHICH IS WE BELIEVE THAT ON THE ASSEMBLY ACTION THE COSTS ARE UNDERSTATED BY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION A AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE A A IS A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THE FOSTER PARENT RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND SUPPORT AGAIN IT'S A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. THE WORKING WARDROBE PROGRAM ANOTHER GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME AND THEN LASTLY THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING VERTICAL PROSECUTION. THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION WE DON'T SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. LASTLY FOR THE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST PROPOSAL AGAIN THAT WOULD BE A CONFORMING ACTION WITHIN THE FINAL PROP NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. THANK YOU. AND NOT TO THE COMMITTEE AND. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATOR MORLOCK. I I YOU KNOWS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR YEARS AT THE SENATE MUCH WITH A FRIEND AT LIVE PROGRAM I I WONDER IF IT'S. CANISTER DIPS PURPOSE IN. I CAL LIKE IF YOU SOME. SUPPORT. ARE SOME STUDY THAT WOULD SUPPORT CONTINUING ITS I AGREE WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. FRIDAY NIGHT I SENATOR MITCHELL. IF YOU HAD HAS IT NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN PAID FOR BY YOU KNOW LOCAL EITHER CEDAR COUNTY PARK REC DEPARTMENT THROUGH THE STATE EVER. FUNDED FREDDIE MAC Y.. THERESA COLOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A FEDERAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND PREVENTION TREATMENT GRANT DID FUND IT IN ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION. FOR A FEW YEARS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN TO. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN TO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO FIND FOR HISTORICAL TWENTY. THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE ON THIS ITEM IF I'M READING UP PROPERLY IS THAT IT'S OPERATE ON BEHALF OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO THE TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. UTILIZING THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY DOES MAKE ELIGIBLE FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS. THANK YOU. CENTER ON A MISTER CHAIR ON THE SCHOOLS SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. IS IS THIS REQUEST BASED ON A STUDY THE OF A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS AND IS IS IS THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TIED TO OF. PARTICULAR. SHORTFALL IN SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SCHOOLS. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE GENESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY SPEND. MOST OF IT IS RELATED TO SERVICES FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC DISABILITY AT THE RECEIVING AT THROUGH STATE FEDERAL LAWS THAT REQUIRE. DISTRICTS TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL WAS TO EXPAND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST SERVICES TO STUDENTS IN GENERAL EDUCATION WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC DISABILITY BUT COULD STILL BENEFIT FROM THOSE SERVICES I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS A SPECIFIC. STUDY BEYOND THAT MOTIVATIONAL SO WE WE DO SO WE DON'T HAVE A REPORT THAT SAYS WE'RE SHORT. THREE HUNDRED SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN THAT EQUATES TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR. WE'RE SHORT FIVE HUNDRED IN THAT EQUATES TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THOUGH I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF HIS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DOLLARS AND. A DOCUMENTED I'M SURE THERE'S A NEED. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC STUDY ON THAT BASIS THIS IS A MEMBER S.. HAD THAT'S RIGHT THIS IS COMING FROM THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICAN CAUCUS I SEE OKAY THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR FEEDBACK. OKAY. SO I'LL WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO FEW JOURNEY TODAY AND GET READY FOR TOMORROW I JUST IN TERMS OF. A HOUSE KEEPING I THINK THAT THE GOAL. AYE IS OUR OUR BUDGET STAFF WILL BE ARE WORKING TO PREPARE THE CONFERENCE AGENDA FOR TOMORROW. THE GOAL WORLD TO BE A TO GET THE AGENDA ITEMS OUT TO EVERYBODY HOPEFULLY EITHER LATE TONIGHT OR FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING. WE WANT TO ALLOW PLENTY OF TIME FOR DISCUSSION IN BRIEFING WITH IN.

THE EXCHANGE OF PEOPLE THE MORE TIME YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO LET OUR STAFF NOW. BUT THAT IS LOCAL. SENATOR MOCK. ARE WE MEETING ON FRIDAY AS WELL. I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN. GO THROUGH AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND. WE USUALLY END UP BY MEETING LATE INTO THE NIGHT AND I THINK THAT TO THAT THE GOAL BE THAT WE'LL SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GET TO MARK. NOW WE VOTING TOMORROW. SO THAT WOULD BE THE OUT. OKAY. ANON THE VERY I DIFFER NOT THAT DIFFERENT ITEMS PASS SORRY DID LIKE. WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT. OUR FOR FEET HIM WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND SO IT'S A LITTLE GREAT SITE. POSTERS FOR ASKING QUESTIONS BUT NO NO NO NO DON'T KNOW POINT JUST REPRESSIONS.
