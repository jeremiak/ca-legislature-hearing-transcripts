IS HERE FOR A BI SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MORNING THANK YOU- IF THERE'S ONE UNDENIABLE FACT THAT I CAN SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY IT WOULD BE THAT OUR STATE IS IN CRISIS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE FACING TODAY ON OUR STREETS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES LIKE THE HOMELESS AND NOW GONE ABUSE DRUG ABUSE ALSO STEM FROM AN TREATED MENTAL ILLNESS FURTHER ADDING TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE ONGOING STORAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS CALIFORNIA AS IS THE PANDEMIC. THE SUPPLY PROFESSIONAL HAS NOT GROWN AMID RISING DEMAND FOR SERVICES. DURING THE PANDEMIC LOCKDOWNS THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS BECOME. BECAME A TOPIC OF URGENCY. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION. 64% IT OTHERS RESPONDENT POLL SHARE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL. OR EMOTIONAL HEALTH I GOT WORSE. A LOT WORSE SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. ADDITIONALLY 91% OF PROVIDERS SURVEY REPORTED AN INCREASE IN PATIENTS EXPERIENCE A RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES INCLUDE DEPRESSION. SELF RELATED DISORDERS AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IT WAS REPORTED THAT OVER TWO FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DIE FROM SUICIDE. AS ATTITUDES SURROUNDING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE PAST DECADE MORE PEOPLE ARE FINDINGA LOT EASIER TO ASK FOR THE HEALTH THEY ARE SEEKING. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE ADDRESSES THE GROWING DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS BY CREATING A GRANT PROGRAM WITHIN THE EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH. PRACTITIONER FUND TO HELP REPAY SCHOOL LOANS FOR INDIVIDUALS PURSUING A CAREER AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND HAVE COMMITTED TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. SUPPORTING SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINES ORGANIZATION A FEW CALLS RECEIVED BY SUICIDAL. PREVENTION HOTLINES. THIS BILL IS A MEASURE THAT WOULD HELP PUT MORE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AS WE CONTINUE TO FACE A GROWING CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH RELATED ISSUES AND THE STATE. WITH THAT I ASKED RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DON'T BELIEVE. WITNESSES. WAS WITNESSES. THANKS SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION- BUT IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE CHAMBERS WHO WANTS IN IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WANTS TO- ADD ON LET'S FIRST START WITH IN SUPPORT. ANYBODY ONE THAT WANTS TO ADD ON. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEN ON ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO THAT ON IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ELIANA WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION FOR THE REASONS STATED IN THE ANALYSIS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR IN OPPOSITION SAYING NINE ONE BRING BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ADULT WEBER. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- PRESENTING TODAY AND FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE THAT IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE THAT WE AS A SOCIETY NEED TO FOCUS ON A LOT MORE- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. THIS LOAN- WHEN YOU SAY REPAY EDUCATIONAL LOANS WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY THAT DO YOU MEAN ALL LOANS UNDERGRAD GRADUATE SCHOOL- WHAT THEY HAVE NOW IS A SPECIFIC GRANT PROGRAM. OUR PEOPLE CAN APPLY THING FOR UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LIKE THREE TIMES SO WHAT IS. THE THOUGHT PROCESS BEHIND THIS EDUCATION MY UNDERSTANDING WITH THIS BILL IT'S SPECIFIC FOR GRAD AND IS THERE A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT YOU WERE THINKING WOULD BE- PROBLEMA. WE DON'T OKAY AND BECAUSE THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE SCHOOL AS WELL SO THAT'S WHY. I MEAN THE LOAN ITSELF COULD BE SMALL LARGE DEPENDING ON SO YOU'RE KIND OF LEFT IT OPEN MEET REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN- THAT'S WHERE WHO. HOPING. FOR OKAY I'M AND THEN AS FAR AS FINDING- ARE WE- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW MUCH FUNDING YOU'D BE ASKING FOR LOCAL INCOME. I'M SORRY THE MINUTE. CERTAIN THE FUNDING ITSELF IS IN THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH PETITIONER EDUCATION FUND THE EXISTING AND THEN OF COURSE DEPENDING ON WHAT THE APPROPRIATION OF THIS YOU KNOW OF OUR FLESHLY BODY AGREES TO GO FORWARD. OKAY SO EASILY ALLOW THIS AS PART OF THAT FUNDING TO BE USED SO WOULD YOU BE TAKING AWAY FROM ANY OF THE CURRENT FUNDING THAT IS ALREADY DESIGNATED FOR THAT OTHER PROGRAMS. I DON'T BELIEVE SO OKAY AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION WITH THE FACT THAT THIS KIND OF EXTEND TO- YOU KNOW THOSE FOR PROFIT FACILITIES THEIR ART THERE IS NO AYE SPECIFICATION THAT THEY NEED TO BE LIKE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES JUST THAT THEY WORK AT A SUICIDE OR A PLACE WHERE A SUICIDE HOTLINE MAY REFER THEM TO WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS. A SUICIDE HOTLINE WOULD. I PREFER TO PROBABLY ANY MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY SO YES THE I'M SORRY ON INTERRUPT ON THE THIS IS SPECIFICALLY JUST FOR NONPROFIT IT'S NOT FOR PROFIT. OKAY SO IT'S SPECIFIC FOR NONPROFIT BUT ANY PARTICULAR AREA SO IT COULD BE. YOU KNOW IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA OR FOR AN OVER SERVED AREA WE COULD THERE ARE DOWN TO UNDERSERVED AREA BUT I THINK MENTAL HEALTH I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYWHERE THAT'S OVER SERVE I DON'T THINK YOU SEE ANY LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAS MORE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY NEED- I THINK IT'S ACROSS THE STATE. THE NEED IS AND IS THERE FOR EVERY FURTHER ACROSS THE STATE STATE SO I DON'T THINK. OF FROM OUR RESEARCH IS THAT IT'S UNDERSERVED ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT. WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN THE AREA IF YOU KNOW OF THEM LET US KNOW WE CAN MAYBE. OF AMEND THE BILL TO SPECIFIC SAID NOT IN THAT AREA- WELL I THINK I THINK LIKE WITH ANY KIND OF MEDICAL SERVICE THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS THAT HAVE- MORE PROVIDERS WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL DENTAL OR- YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN WHICH YOU FIND IN SOME OTHER AREAS AND SO I THINK WITH. THIS FUND THIS ORIGINAL FUN IT'S REALLY. TRYING TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING MORE- THAN TO HEALTH PROVIDERS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. I THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE ADDING THAT INTO THE BILL SINCE THAT IS A- KEY COMPONENT OF THE OPPOSITION I'M WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAL SERVICES WE IN THIS BODY HAS ALWAYS TARGET AREAS THAT UNDERSERVED. EIGHT MEDICAL UN DOES IS SEEKING MEDICAL HELP ESPECIALLY RURAL AREAS AS A MUCH MUCH HARDER DIFFICULT TIME THAN THOSE OF US SAY AN ORANGE COUNTY OR LOS ANGELES OR SAN DIEGO EIGHT. SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT. OUR PURPOSE OF THE BILL HAS BEEN IS TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH IN GENERAL BECAUSE THAT'S A CRISIS ACROSS THE STATE- BUT I'M HEARING YOUR CONCERN I HAVE NO PROBLEM. AT A SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO NARROW IT DOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T GO INTO AREAS THAT HAS WAY TOO MANY MENTAL HEALTH- PROFESSIONAL WHICH AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY AREAS IN CALIFORNIA- I UNDERSTAND THE MEDICAL SIDE. BUT IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACROSS SO- WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO LOOK AT IT AND NARROW IT DOWN. I WOULD- STRONGLY I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OFFICES WORKED WITH- THE OPPOSITION. BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU YOU WON'T WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO- CLEAR UP SOME OF THESE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING VERSUS WHAT THE CURRENT- REPAYMENT LOAN REPAYMENT GRANT PROGRAM HAS- SO TODAY I WILL. SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE. MORE WERE SERVICES IN THE AREA MENTAL HEALTH- BUT I DO HOPE THAT THIS IS CLEARED UP AS IT. CONTINUES TO MOVE ALONG THE PATH. YEAH NO- MY IN THE STANDS OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEM- AND HAVE. TRIED TO WORK ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THIS LETTERS WAS GIVEN TO US LIKE A WEEK AGO. SO KIND OF HARD TO TRY TO GET EVERYTHING UNDER THERE BUT THEY'VE BEEN ADDRESSING BUT PRICE THAT WE'VE BEEN INCOME CONVERSATION- BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS INTO ABOUT A WEEK AGO WE WILL CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM. BUT AGAIN THIS IS SPECIFIC. NOT AFFORD. THE NOT FOR PROFIT. ORGANIZATIONS THANK YOU. YOU TALKED WEBER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE- SO MEMBER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD N HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OFOUR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD CREATE MORE INCENTIVES FOR A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN CREATING INCENTIVES FOR PROVIDERS SERVING AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO LACK ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES- AND SO YEAH I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT JUST HAPPENED WANT TO- ENCOURAGE- THE AUTHOR- TO SUPPORT THE PRIORITIZATION OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE MORE THAN ONE DAY TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT ISSUE- I HOPE THIS LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THIS NEED. AND ENSURES ADEQUATE RESOURCES A RESERVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WE MUST CONTINUE TO BUILD THE WORKFORCE THAT WILL SERVE ALL COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THE HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA- AND WHEN THE TIME COMES ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT BILL YOU MUCH.

THE DATA YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WAS ONLY A LITTLE OVER A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS REPORTED IN THE ENTIRE YEAR IN THIS CALIFORNIA. WHEREAS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE JUST IN THE FIRST FIVE MONTHS OVER EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HOWEVER REPORTED THAT THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAD BEEN STOLEN. THESE THEFTS ARE BEING DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE TO SEEK SOME OF THE PRECIOUS AND EXPENSIVE METALS IN THESE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- WHERE THEY MELT THESE DOWN AND- AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A- A MARKET FOR THESE METALS- BUT- WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS. AKHIR THIS YOU KNOW. SEARCH THE SPIKE IN. THESE TYPE OF CRIMES BY TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE PROFIT MOTIVE BY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM FROM THE- FROM THE- THE RECYCLER. CHOP SHOPS- SIDE OF THE OPERATION- AND- BY REQUIRING A CORE RECYCLERS TO- VERIFY VEHICLE OWNERSHIP OF BEFORE PURCHASE AND TO PROHIBIT THEM FROM ACCEPTING THAT FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN A LICENSED ENTERPRISE OR THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE- WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT TO TAKE AWAY THAT THAT PROFIT MOTIVE- TO- DISINCENTIVE VICE AND THESE TYPE OF CRIMES.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- OF DYLAN SILVER PEDIATRICIAN AND DIRECTOR OF THE SAFELY OPENING SCHOOLS PROJECT AT THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE- DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS STATEWIDE OUGHT TO INCREASE COVERT NINETEEN RAPID TESTING. AND I THINK ALL OF YOU KNOW THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF COPING NINETEEN ON EDUCATION AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN- TO DO SO WE'VE WORKED TO OVERCOME THE MANY BARRIERS TO INCREASING TESTING AVAILABILITY FROM DATA SYSTEMS TO HUMAN RESOURCES. AND THE LATEST OMICRON SEARCH SOMETIMES A QUARTER STAFF AND STUDENTS WERE INFECTED IN SCHOOLS WOULD CLOSE WITHOUT AT ACCESS TO TESTING. ON OUR SCHOOLS PERFORMED OVER FOUR MILLION TESTS JUST THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND TODAY THE NEW OMICRON BA TO SIR JUST STARTING AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT OUR SCHOOLS- AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IS UNCERTAIN. SO THROUGH BASICALLY ONE LESSON WE'VE LEARNEDIT'S QUITE SIMPLY TO BE READY- IN RECENT SURVEYS MOST MOST REAFFIRM THEIR DESIRE TO MAINTAIN THE OPTION OF TESTING ON SITE AS PER. THAT READING READINESS. SO MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ALREADY USED RAPID TESTS NOW LICENSED FOR HOME USE AND YOU KNOW HOW EASY THEY ARE. THE STATE IS DISTRIBUTING MILLIONS OF THEM UP FIRST. NOW BUT FOR THE LARGE SCALE TESTING IN SCHOOLS THIS IS STILL CARRIED OUT UNDER THE- CLIA WAIVER PROCESS. AND THAT REQUIRES A TESTING BE DONE BY A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. ALTHOUGH INTERPRETATIONS WERE FORTUNATELY MADE ALLOWING SCHOOL STAFF TO PERFORM THE TESTS THE BARRIERS REMAINED FOR EXTENDING- TO TRAIN PARENTS NON SCHOOL EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER. HOURS TO DO TWO THINGS EVEN WITH THESE VERY SIMPLE METHODS SCHOOL NURSES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY AND TESTING VENDORS. ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES IN RECRUITING SUFFICIENT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL AREAS. MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SURGE- TESTING- TO INCREASE TESTING DURING A SURGE OR TO MAINTAIN A TRAINED CADRE. OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR VOLUNTEERS. AB TWENTY ONE OH SEVEN WILL CORRECT THIS BARRIER ALLOWING APPROPRIATELY TRAINED AND SUPERVISED ADULTS. THE TEST IF ONCE. AGAIN WE NEED TO SCALE UP SCHOOL TESTING. USING THE SENT TECH.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY WHENEVER YOU ARE A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWO FOUR ZERO SEVEN WHICH TIGHTENS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SALE OF USED CATALYTIC CONVERTERS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THIEVES TO PROFIT. FROM SELLING STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IN YOUR OWN YOUR OWN DISTRICTS AND THERE'S ANOTHER FACTOR I. I HAVEN'T A CAR WHERE IT NEEDS A NEW CATALOG KOMMER WHAT IS STOLEN. BUT GUESS WHAT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ONLY AT THE DELER GET THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THOUGHTS GOING ON OUT THERE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF IMPACTS IT'S NOT JUST HAVING IT STOLEN BUT IT'S IF YOU NEED A NEW ONE AS WELL. KATELYN CONVERTERS ARE MISSION CONTROLLED I'VE DEVICES ON CARS AND TRUCKS THE U. SEVERAL COMPONENTS SUCH AS PRECIOUS METALS LIKE PLATINUM. PALLADIUM AT ROAD. RHODIUM TO CONVERT TOXIC GASES INTO LESS. HARMFUL EXHAUST UNFORTUNATELY INCREASES IN THE PRICES OF THE PRECIOUS METALS IN THESE DEVICES. HAS RESULTED IN THEM BECOMING A LUCRATIVE TARGET FOR THIEVES OF WHICH YOU KNOW. ACCORDING TO THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEFT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES INCREASED BY 4100% IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND HAS INCREASED NATIONWIDE BY A STAGGERING EIGHTY BY A STAGGERING ELEVEN THE ELEVEN HUNDRED AND 71% SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. HELLO CONVERTERS CAN BE REMOVED FROM VEHICLES IN AS LITTLE AS TWO MINUTES TWO MINUTES AND YOUR CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS GONE. DESPITE SIMILARITIES TO OTHER SCRAP METALS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY STOLEN AND OFFERED TO RECYCLERS CATALYTIC CONVERTERS SALES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ANTI THEFT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS THESE OTHER MODELS THERE AFTER THE METALS IN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER NOT JUST THE CONVERTER BECAUSE THOSE METALS ARE SO VALUABLE SO PRECIOUS. AB TWENTY FOUR OH SEVEN ELIMINATES THESE INCONSISTENCIES BY REQUIRING CORPS RECYCLERS TO REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT SALES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IF TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OBTAIN THE THUMBPRINT OF THE SELLERS AND REQUEST TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATIONS FROM A THEFT ALERT SYSTEM. THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE SHOWN BY THE NATIONAL HAVE TO HAVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWN BY THE NATIONAL INSURANCE CRIME BUREAU TO REDUCE METAL THEFTS AND WILL DO THE SAME FOR CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- COPPER THERE'S OTHER PRECIOUS METALS- IF YOU GO BISON. AND GENERATING STATIONS THE LEADERS SAY THE OVERSIGHT OTHERS A NO COPPER IN THIS GENERATING STATION BECAUSE COPPER IS VERY VALUABLE SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ESTABLISH THE- THE SAME PROTOCOLS. OR FOR CATHOLIC CONVERTER METALS AS THERE ARE FOR MANY OTHER METALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO TESTIFY IS TIM CHANG WITH THE AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SALAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS THANK YOU FOR. RIGHT YEAH MR CHU AND MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT TIM CHANG FOR THE AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AGAIN- SINCE THIS IS THE SECOND DECK CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILL I WON'T REPEAT MY PRIOR TESTIMONY BUT I WANTED TO ADD ON- SOMETHING OF THAT ASSEMBLY MINNA DONALD SAID WHILE IT'S BEEN WELL IT'S EASY TO STEAL A CATALYTIC CONVERTER MAY TAKE YOU KNOW SECONDS TWO MINUTES- DEPENDING ON THE SKILL OF THE FEVER THERE COULD BE SECONDARY DAMAGE THAT OCCURS TWO VEHICLES WHICH OFTEN- RAISES THE COST OF- OF REPAIR- FURTHER WITH THE CURRENT SUPPLIES TO SHORTAGES- OBTAINING A NEW CATERPILLAR CONVERTER FOR YOUR VEHICLE CAN BE A SOMETIMES LENGTHY. PROCESS WHICH FURTHER ADDS THE INCONVENIENCE OF VICTIMS AND WE URGE ADVISED VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WHO WANT TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT. MISTER MEMBERS RANDY PERRY WITH THE ALLIANCE FROM OF INNOVATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ONE OF BRING BACK TO COLLEGE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEY HAVE. YEAH BUT WEBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS BILL- I HAD A QUESTION AROUND THE THUMB PRINT REQUIREMENTS I'M IS THERE ANYONE WHO IS EXEMPT FROM THAT I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN YOUR BILL- NO BUT WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IF SOME PERSONS SHOULD BE EXEMPT.

WE GOT ANOTHER OFFER THOUGH THANK YOU MISTER DAY WE WILL HAVE A VOTE AS SOON AS WE GET THAT ONE THAT ARMY OF ONE TO JOIN US YOU DESERVE A QUORUM I THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE THAT YOU. THANK YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN AND A SCHOLAR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. READY WHEN YOU ARE ON ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. JUST TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP WE ARE ONE MEMBER AWAY FROM A QUORUM. JUST ONE. ON. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. WHEN VOTERS SUPPORTED PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. THEY DID ON THE PREMISE THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD BE BALANCED. CONSUMER DESIRE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY SIMILAR TO OTHER INDUSTRIES LIKE ALCOHOL. UNFORTUNATELY THAT BALANCE WASN'T EXECUTED IN THE SUSTAINABLE. OR COMPELLING WAY. AS A RESULT OF THIS LIGHT FOOTED APPROACH AN UNINTENDED UNTESTED AND UNREGULATED MARKET NOW EXIST IN A WAY THAT EVEN BEFORE THE PASSING OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. WE WOULD LIKE AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IN DECEMBER TO DINO COUNTY IN MY DISTRICT ALONE. THERE'S BEEN A OF ILLEGAL MARIJUANA PLANTS SINCE THE PASSING OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. BUT CREATE A GRADUATION IN THE CIVIL PENALTY STRUCTURE FOR UNLICENSED CANNABIS ACTIVITY SIZE IN THE SCALE OF THE ONLINE UNLICENSED CANNABIS OPERATIONS WITH A NUMBER OF PLANTS. NUMBER OF PREVIOUS INFRACTIONS. AMOUNT OF PRODUCT IN OTHER EXTENUATING FACTORS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN ASSESSING THE FINE. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA LET THE VOICES BE HEARD IN CHOSE TO DECRIMINALIZE CANNABIS. I SUPPORTED THEIR CHOICE. HOWEVER THEY DID NOT ASK FOR A RAMPANT CULTIVATION AND IN THE LEGAL MARKET SUCKING UP RESOURCES DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT. AND PUTTING OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT I BELIEVE YOU HAVE MISTER BRAD JENSEN YES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND IF THE KEYS HERE. ONE AMBER. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS ON RED JENSEN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. WE'VE BROUGHT THIS MEASURE BEFORE YOU FOR- TO CONSIDER I GRADUATED CIVIL PENALTY- STRUCTURE FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH HAS MENTIONED WE'VE SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS FARMING ACROSS THE MOJAVE DESERT. WE ESTIMATE HAVING AT LEAST THIRTEEN HUNDRED FARMS IN OUR COUNTY ALONE SOME ESTIMATES RANGE AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THIS CAUSES ANUMEROUS SET OF PROBLEMS FOR US AND DEALING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP- LAWLESSNESS WATER THEFT AND SO FORTH. WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING A GRADUATED CIVILS CIVIL PENALTY STRUCTURE IS VERY GOOD FOR THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET WHICH WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. WE THINK THAT THAT THE LARGER THE GROW THE MORE PLANTS THAT YOU'RE CULTIVATING YOU SHOULD PAY TO HAVE YOUR FINE. AND BY ELIMINATING THEM- WE ARE SUPPORTING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO ARE ENGAGED IN LEGAL CANNABIS.WHO PAY TAXES WHO PULL PERMITS AND WHO FOLLOW PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY CODES SO WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT THIS MORNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I DON'T HAVE ANY ON MY SHEET. I DON'T SEE ANY ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WHO WANT TO ADD ON BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHY A BUNCH THIS MORNING. THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE GOOD BILLS THAT WERE- STUDENT ART WEBER I JINXED YOU I APOLOGIZE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ALL AWARE OF. SOME OF THE- AND INTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF YOU KNOW THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA WITH YOU HAVING LARGE- MANUFACTURERS OR OR FARMS GROWING ILLEGAL MARIJUANA. I'M I THINK ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH YOUR BILL- IS. THAT YOU GO DOWN TO SIX PLANTS. BECAUSE TO ME THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS. WE ARE TRYING TO GO AFTER WHO YOU SHOULD BE TRYING TO GO AFTER THEY'RE NOT A BIG PLAYER IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO ONLY HAS SIX PLANTS. AND SO TO- START INCREASING THEIR FINES- FOR SOMEONE WHO'S PROBABLY LIKE LOW INCOME VERY SMALL PLAYER IN THIS GAME IS. IS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING FOR ME SO IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WHY YOU WENT SOLO. IN ORDER FOR TOMORROW. LIKE AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT IS BASED ON THE COUNTIES FEE STRUCTURE WHICH WAS ENACTED AN ORDINANCE LAST AUGUST IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- I THINK THAT I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO GO AFTER THE BIG FISH NOT THE LITTLE GUY- AND I THINK THAT THAT'S AN OPEN CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD AND I'LL DEFER TO THE AUTHOR OF COURSE BUT- I THINK THAT'S PART OF A SOMETHING WE COULD REDUCE. THE REASON TO GO TO SIX WELL PLANTS IZLE CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU CAN HAVE SIX INDIVIDUALS WE HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY BEFORE BUT I'M NOT AFTER. I'M I'M SORRY CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN IT. THE CURRENT LAW SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE UP TO SIX PLANTS IS CURRENT LAW THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT LANGUAGE IN THE BILL GOING FORWARD WE'RE NOT AFTER THE LITTLE ONES IN THE I DON'T THINK ANY DA IN THE STATE. WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAVE HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF PLANTS. RIGHT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PUT IT IN HERE. THEN THE OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE TO GO AFTER SOMEONE. WITH ONLY SIX OR SEVEN PLAN BUT I THINK WITH THE LEADS COUNCILS LANGUAGE IT HAD TO BE PUT IN THERE AT SIX ONE. I DO JUST ONE COMMENT THAT THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- WHERE WHERE A LOT OF THESE. BIG QUESTIONS CAN ALSO BE EVALUATED OFF JUST TO SEE WHAT- HAPPENED IMAGES DUE TO SHERRY COMMITTEE. ON BECAUSE I THINK GOING DOWN SO LOW IS JUST GOING AFTER THIS THAT THE SMALL FISH WHEN WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO BE GOING AFTER. THE BIG FISH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY REALLY PROFITING FROM THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHETHER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THING ON SOME MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE A RESHAPE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND I DEFINITELY THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS MORE UNLICENSED ACTIVITY THAN WE'D LIKE- AND UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON LICENSEES ON CONSUMERS IN THE REGULATORY SCHEME OVERALL- IF ADDITIONAL PENALTIES WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AS I JUST MENTIONED THE BILL WILL ALSO GO TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NEXT. WHERE THE AMOUNTS IN THE NATURE OF THE PENALTIES- I'M SURE WILL BE DISCUSSED FURTHER- WHEN WE HAVE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA LOSE ONE. OKAY THIS IS THE DAY. THAT I GOT NERVOUS HE HAS JUST ONE MORE MEMBER WE WILL HAVE A VOTE ON THIS BILL. AND ALL THE OTHER BILLS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TODAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WHEN YOU GET A QUORUM LOCK THE DOORS THANK YOU THEY EXACTLY RIGHT EXACTLY RIGHT WILL DO THANK YOU SOME MEMBER SMITH- AND NOW WE STILL DON'T HAVE. ONE MEMBER BUT WE HAVE A SET BUT WE DO HAVE ANOTHER PRESENTER PERMITS ON A RECALL THEIR OWN- WITH AGENDA ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX. MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS. FIRST I'D IKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND I WILL BE TAKING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX WILL PROHIBITORY A- REVOKING OR SUSPENDING THE MEDICAL LICENSE OF A PHYSICIAN AND SURGEON. FOR PROVIDING SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION CARE TO PATIENTS AND CALIFORNIA OR IN OTHER STATES. TWENTY SIX STATES ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO BAN ABORTION. WITH MANY STATES AUTHORIZING THE MEDICAL BOARD TO TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST THE ABORTION PROVIDER. AS A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO BE A DESTINATION FOR MILLIONS OF PREGNANT PEOPLE SEEKING ABORTION CARE THAT THEY CANNOT GET IN THEIR OWN STATE. THIS LEGISLATION PREVENTS THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA FROM REVOKING OR SUSPENDING A LICENSE FOR PROVIDING LAWFUL ABORTION. PATIENTS SEEKING CARE FROM CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS WITH ME IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX IS DR DANIEL GROSSMAN A PROFESSOR OF OPS THE TETRIS OFF OFF THE TOP TRICKS AND GYNECOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WHERE HE DIRECTS A RESEARCH PROGRAM CALLING CALLED ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. THANK YOU DOCTOR. THANK YOU I'M AS A PRACTICING OBGYN I HAVE WORKED IN COUNTRIES WHERE ABORTION IS ILLEGAL OR RESTRICTED AND I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW PREGNANT PEOPLE- HAVE TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNSAFE ABORTIONS SOMETIMES PAYING WITH THEIR LIVES. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SEE THE DAY- WHEN ABORTION CARE WOULD BE ILLEGAL HERE IN THE U. S. STATE BUT THAT DAY HAS ALREADY ARRIVED HERE IN TEXAS- AND AS WE JUST HEARD OF IT'S LIKELY WET THAT WITH ROE VERSUS WADE BEING UNDERMINED IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. THAT MAY HAPPEN IN POTENTIALLY HALF OF THE STATES IN THE U. S. AS A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND THAT IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT MY FELLOW PHYSICIAN ABORTION PROVIDERS TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY WE CANNOT SIT IDLY BY- AS WE SEE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY IN OTHER STATES. PUTTING THEIR HEALTH AT RISK WHEN WE HAVE THE SKILLS AND TOOLS TO HELP THEM. IF A PATIENT IN A STATE WITH SEVERE RESTRICTIONS SEEKS OUT MY HELP AND TO OBTAIN SAFE ABORTION CARE I WOULD FEEL COMPELLED TO HELP THEM- FOR EXAMPLE A PATIENT MAY TRAVEL HERE TO CALIFORNIA TO OBTAIN ABORTION CARE HERE. THEY MAY TRAVEL HERE TO RECEIVE MEDICATIONS TO START THE ABORTION WHICH WOULD THEN BE COMPLETED IN THEIR HOME STATE OR THEY MAY SEEK OUT- TELEHEALTH SERVICES TO OBTAIN A MEDICATION ABORTION PER CALIFORNIA PROVIDER. AND DESPITE MY GOOD INTENTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE NEEDING ABORTION CARE IN THE STATE'S I UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD FACE A NUMBER OF LEGAL RISKS- BY PROVIDING THE CARE THAT I'VE OUTLINED TO A PATIENT. FROM A STATE THAT HAS BANNED ABORTION INCLUDING POTENTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CRIMINAL PENALTIES AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MY LICENSE. AB TWENTY SIX TWENTY SIX WOULD HELP ADDRESS AT LEAST THIS LAST POINT- BY ENSURING THAT MY MEDICAL LICENSE WOULD NOT BE SUSPENDED OR REVOKED. BECAUSE OF THE WASHING CARE THAT I PROVIDED THAT IS OTHERWISE LEGAL AND SAFE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE MUST STAND FIRM AGAINST THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT THESE RESTRICTIVE LAWS WILL HAVE. AND STATE CLEARLY THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN PROVIDE SAFE. CARE THAT IS LEGAL HERE WILL NOT BE PUNISHED EVEN IF THE PATIENT IS A RESIDENT OF A STATE WITH SEVERE RESTRICTIONS. A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS PROTECTION SAFEGUARDING OUR MEDICAL LICENSE. THANK YOU DR GROSSMAN WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN- SUPPORT. HELLO MOLLY ROBESON WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA WERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. C. NUMBERING BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR WEBER.

ALLOW FOR ON SITE CANNABIS SALES CONSUMPTION WITHIN A LIMITED SET OF VENUES. AND UNDER SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS BY THE STATE. HOWEVER THESE LICENSES DO NOT CURRENTLY COVER SITUATIONS IN WHICH AN EVENT HOST PRE PAYS FOR CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS. PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE MOVING YES. BY CREATING THESE CATERING LICENSES AB TWENTY FORTY FOUR. WE'LL CREATE A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO HELP INSURERS GREATER SAFETY AND OVERSIGHT OF CANNABIS CONSUMPTION. GATHERINGS SUCH AS WEDDINGS AND WELLNESS RETREATS. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JERRED KILOH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CANNABIS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. AND BRIAN APPLEGARTH FOUNDER OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TOURISM ASSOCIATION. RIGHT RIGHT ON YOUR. I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED TO HIT THE BUTTON A- BIRD I GUESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BRIAN APPLEGARTH FOUNDER OF THE CANNABIS TRAVEL ASSOCIATION FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TOURISM ASSOCIATION FOR UNITED VOICE OF CAMPUS TRAVEL. COSPONSOR OF AB TWENTY FORTY FOUR. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA'S TRAVEL INDUSTRY WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST ECONOMIC DRIVERS OF OUR STATE ACCORDING TO DEAN RUNYAN ASSOCIATES IN TWENTY NINETEEN MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIA WORKERS EARN THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND HOSPITALITY. AND VISITORS SPENT A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY GENERATING TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. THEN CAME TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND A BOOMING CALIFORNIA TRAVELING SHE WAS DEVASTATED MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS IN THE STATE LOST SEVENTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION IN VISITOR SPENDING IN TWENTY TWENTY A FIFTY FOUR POINT 5% DECLINE FROM THE YEAR PRIOR. I CANNABIS CATERING LICENSE OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE SAFETY IN THE VISITOR ECONOMY DIFFERENTIATION IN CALIFORNIA TRAVEL AND ALTERNATELY SUPPORT RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC FOR THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY. THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY TODAY REPESENTS APPROXIMATELY FOUR BILLION IN ANNUAL SALES EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE TAXES THREE HUNDRED MILLION LOCAL TAXES AND HAS CREATED AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS. IN- A CALIFORNIA CANNABIS- GOT THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS CATERING LICENSE IS NEEDED TODAY AND AS OUTLINED IN AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FOUR IT'S PROPOSED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CAMPUS CONTROL ME ISSUE STATE CATER LICENSE AT AUTHORIZES THE LICENSEE TO SERVE CANNABIS AT A PRIVATE EVENT.

THAT ARE PART OF THE TRAVEL ECOSYSTEM OF CALIFORNIA. IN CLOSING THE CANNABIS TRAVEL ASSOCIATION REQUEST COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY FORTY FOUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF MY NAME IS CHAIRED KYLO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CAMPUS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION- WE'VE COME TO THIS BILL BECAUSE AS A RETAILER IN THE CANNABIS SPACE FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS OF MYSELF- WE'VE BEEN SEEING THIS ACTIVITY PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND POST TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROP SIXTY FOUR. THAT TIVITY IS BRINGING TOGETHER TAURUS IT'S BRING TOGETHER FAMILIES IS BRINGING TOGETHER A LOT OF. PRIVATE EVENTS THE PRIDE EVENTS ARE ALSO ALREADY HAVING THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES HAPPEN. AND WHAT WE'RETRYING TO DO HERE IN THIS BILL IS GIVE A PLACE FOR REGULATION GIVE A PLACE FOR EDUCATION AND EVENT. FOR THE U. AREN'T THE DRUNK UNCLE AT A WEDDING. YOU WE'RE GIVING THESE OPPORTUNITIES NOW FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE ON THE LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AWAY FROM MAYBE A HOTEL. THAT WOULD WANT TO HAVE SOME INSURANCE TO COVER ANY SORT OF THESE LIABILITIES WE'RE GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ASSESS RISK. AND IN THE ASSESSMENT OF RISK THEY CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THIS LICENSE A PLACE INSIDE OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE 75% OF MOST COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T OFFER ANY SORT OF ACCESS TO LEGAL RETAIL CANNABIS. WE NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW THIS KIND OF EVENTS AND THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES TO HAPPEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE WHAT ADULTS DO. ADULTS ARE TWENTY ONE AND OLDER IN THIS PARTICULAR AND IF PARTICULAR VENUE- THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR CHILDREN. TO ACCESS THESE PRODUCTS MOST OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE OFFERING OR AT LEAST KIND OF. EXEMPLIFYING THIS BILL IS CLOSED CHILD RESISTANT TAMPER EVIDENT SEAL PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO GAS- REALLY OTHER THAN THAT. THE HOTEL'S REALLY WANT TO FIND A WAY TO ENTER THE SPACE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSUME IN A WAY THAT IS. NORMAL WITH FAITH AND EDUCATE. WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILL GIVES US THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE REVENUE. TO INCREASE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF RETAIL THAT GOES ON IN THIS IN THE STATE.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE AND BIPARTISANSHIP POTENTIAL PRESENTATION ON THE BILL AS RAIN HOUSING IN THE OTHER BUILDING AND IT FEELS LIKE FOREVER TO GET HERE. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX WHICH WILL EXPAND THE SCOPE OF WORK FOR DENTAL ASSISTANTS THAT HAVE COMPLETED A COURSE ON THE RESPECTIVE PROCEDURES AND OF COURSE ON INFECTION CONTROL TO PERFORM CORONA POLISHING AND APPLY. A PIT AND FISSURE SEALANTS UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED DENTIST CURRENT LAW ALLOWS DENTAL ASSISTANTS TO PERFORM MORE THAN TWENTY DIFFERENT SUPPORT PROCEDURES UNDER THE SUPER OF THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED DENTIST INCLUDING TAKS OF SIMILAR MAGNITUDE AND THOSE IN THIS BILL. SUCH AS THE REMOVAL OF THE POST EXTRACTION TO- DRESSINGS AND DENTAL STITCHES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A SURVEY. REFLECTED THAT 87% OF DENTAL OFFICES REPORTED HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME HIRING DENTAL ASSISTANTS TO LAID OUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WERE CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT POT THAT PASSED THE RDA EXAM IN CALIFORNIA BUT JUST LAST YEAR ALONE THERE IS ONLY EIGHTY ONE EDT HAS PROJECTED AN INCREASE NEED OF MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND DENTAL ASSISTANCE BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. ONE THOUSAND ARE NEEDED IN L. A. COUNTY ALONE WHICH IS THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT IN CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST COUNTY THIS BILL IS A NARROW CHANGE THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE GOING INTO THE POSITION AND MORE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHILE PRESERVING STANDARDS OF PATIENT CARE. I HAVE TO WITNESS WITNESSES HERE TO TALK MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL JESSICA MORAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION AND DR ERRANT SHOT A PEDIATRIC DENTIST THE PRACTICES AND SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT. WEBER WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS AROUND CAL DENTIST. HERE TODAY AS THE SPONSORS AB TWO TWO SEVEN SIX WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR DENTAL ASSISTANTS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES THAT DENTAL PRACTICES ARE EXPERIENCING. CD IS WORKING ON LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES SUCH AS TREATING DENTAL ASSISTANT PIPELINE PROGRAM STORE SMILE COULD ISSUE THIS. AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT WE KNOW THAT WE MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGES IN THE SHORT TERM AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL AIMS TO DO. I'M HERE TODAY WITH OUR MAIN WITNESS DR AARON SHOT AND I'LL BE HERE TODAY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED TO HIT THE BUTTON. THANK YOU. WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS AMENDMENTS WHICH MAKE THE BILL STRONGER. HI MY NAME IS ERIN SHOT I'M A PRACTICING PEDIATRIC DENTISTS IN THE BAY AREA AND VICE CHAIR OF CDS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNSEL. DENTISTRY LIKE MANY OTHER PROFESSIONS WAS HARD HIT BY THE CODE PANDEMIC IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS FORCED TO CLOSE COMPLETELY. NOW TWO YEARS LATER MANY DENTAL OFFICES ARE OPERATING AT CAPACITY IN YOUR PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS UNFORTUNATELY THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED AN ALREADY EXISTING DECLINING DENTAL WORK FORCE PARTICULARLY WITH THE DENTAL ASSISTANT POSITION. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN NO NEARLY 50% DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT AND DENTAL ASSISTANT PROGRAMS NATIONALLY. IN CALIFORNIA THE EIGHTY D. HAS PROJECTED THAT THE THOUSANDS OF VACANT DENTAL PUT DENTAL ASSISTANT POSITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT DEMAND IT IS FAIR TO SAY THERE'S AN ONGOING DENTAL ASSISTANT SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. DENTAL ASSISTANTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE ENTIRE DENTAL TEAM CURRENTLY DENTAL ASSISTANTS CAN ENROLL AND COMPLETE COURSES APPROVED BY THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. AND RECEIVE CERTIFICATIONS TO DO THESE PROCEDURES BUT CANNOT UTILIZE THE SKILLS UNTIL THEY COMPLETE THEIR RESIDENT REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT LICENSURE. AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX WOULD EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE OF DENTAL ASSISTANTS TO INCLUDE CORONA POLISHING EMPLACEMENT OF SEALANTS UNDER THEIR DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A DENTIST AND ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY THE APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATIONS AND COURSE WORK. BOTH OF THESE PROCEDURE ARE REVERSIBLE AND THE SUPERVISING DENTIST WILL HAVE TO BE LISTED ON THE PATIENT RECORD. FOR SEALANTS THE SUPERVISING DENTIST WILL NEED TO REVIEW THE COMPLETED WORK BEFORE SENDING THE PATIENT HOME. I PERSONALLY WORK AT FOUR DIFFERENT PRACTICES IN THE BAY AREA IN THE PAST YEAR ALL FOUR HAVE EXPERIENCED ASSISTANT SHORTAGES THAT AFFECTED PATIENT CARE. WE'VE HAD TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THAT WE SCHEDULE OR CANCEL AND RESCHEDULE COLLINS OF PATIENTS OR ENTIRE PATIENT CARE DAYS. WE'VE HAD TO HIRE ENTRY LEVEL DENTAL ASSISTANCE JUST TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. ECA'S GET THEIR ERTIFICATES FOR XRAYS INFECTION CONTROL AND CRONA POLISHING BUT BECAUSE OF EXISTING LAW RONO POLISHING CAN ONLY BE DONE BY OUR R. D. A.'S. PLACING GREATER WORK BURDEN ON OUR IDEAS THAT WE DO HAVE. AS THEY CANNOT SHARE THE DUTY WITH D. A.'S. SEVERAL OTHER STATES ALREADY ALLOW FOR DENTAL ASSISTANTS TO PERFORM THESE DUTIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATIONS. WERE AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX TO PASS A DENTAL ASSISTANT WOULD STILL NEED TO COMPLETE THE REQUIRED CERTIFICATIONS BEFORE PERFORMING THESE DUTIES. WHICH ADDS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF PATIENT PROTECTION. THIS BILL WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE DENTAL ASSISTING WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ISSUES THAT DENTAL OFFICES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCING BY ALLOWING DENTALASSISTANTS TO PRACTICE TO THE LIMITS OF THEIR CERTIFICATION. AND BALANCE THE NEED OF DENTAL PRACTICES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO HIGHER TEAM MEMBERS REYES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- AND I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE OF PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE WANT TO INVITE THEM UP- WE HAVE MELODY RAND OFF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSISTING ALLIANCE COALITION. JENNIFER TANNAHILL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MELODY RANDOLPH. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND DENTAL ASSISTANTS AND DENTAL ASSISTING EDUCATORS. WE HAVE MANY CONCERNS WITH THIS CHANGED OUR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. ALL ADDRESS JUST A FEW HERE. NUMBER ONE THESE ARE NOT BASIC SUPPORTIVE DUTIES AS DEFINED. OF THE UNLICENSED DA. IN BE IN P. SEVENTEEN FORTY CURRENT POLICY REQUIRES THE USE OF A HANDPIECE. THIS DRUG CAUSES FRICTION AND HEAT AND CAN POTENTIALLY KILL THE NERVE OF THE TOOTH AND DAMAGE SOFT TISSUE. THE PHOSPHORIC ACID USED DURING SEALANT PLACEMENT DAMAGES THE OUTER LAYER OF THE ENAMEL IN ORDER FOR THE SEALANT TO STICK. IF IT TOUCHES SOFT TISSUE IT'LL BURN IT WITHIN SECONDS. DOES THIS SOUND BASIC AND SUPPORTIVE. LACK OF FUNCTIONAL. FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IS OUR NUMBER TWO. THIS CHANGED HER SCOPE OF PRACTICE WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE TO PERFORM THESE DUTIES WITHIN WEEKS OF THE FIRST DAY IN DENTISTRY. THE TWO DAY COURSE REFERENCED EARLIER ON THE CERTIFICATION COURSES IT'S JUST A TWO DAY COURSE. IN THESE PROCEDURES WERE WRITTEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE TAKING THEM WILL ALREADY HAVE. A YEAR'S WORTH OF EDUCATION TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE WE CAN'T POSSIBLY COVER THE FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE AN ASSISTANT NEEDS PRIOR TO PERFORMING THESE DUTIES. IN THESE SHORT COURSES. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY SIX INCREASES THE INSTRUCTIONAL HOURS TO CUT HAIR FROM A THOUSAND HOURS TO TWELVE HUNDRED HOURS. BUT A DA CAN PLACE PHOSPHORIC ACID ON A TOOTH. AND AFTER SIXTEEN HOURS OF EDUCATION. THAT SOUNDS CRAZY WHAT THE BILL'S SPONSOR WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THE DENTIST RARELY SUPERVISORS DURING THESE PROCEDURES. AND LASTLY THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN FACT WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING THESE DUTIES FROM THE RTA TO THE DA WILL MAKE THE SHORTAGE WORSE. AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS THAT TRAINED AND SEASONED RDAS. WILL LEAVE DENTISTRY VIEWING THIS AS A HUGE STEP IN THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR CAREER. PLEASE CONSIDER THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES TO THIS DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE DENTAL ASSISTING SCOPE OF PRACTICE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JENNIFER TANAH HELL WITH AARON REED AND ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL HYGIENISTS ASSOCIATION. CITY HA ECHOES THE DENTAL ASSISTING ALLIANCES CONCERNS FOR PATIENT SAFETY WITH THIS BILLS LACK OF FOUNDATIONAL EDUCATION BEFORE USING PHOSPHORIC ACID ETCH AND MOTORIZED HAND TOOLS INSIDE A CHILD'S MOUTH. WITH POTENTIALLY JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS ON THE JOB LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DENTAL ASSISTANTS ONE THE UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT AND TO THE LICENSED REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT. OR RDA. THE UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT IS ON THE JOB TRAINED NO BACKGROUND CHECK IN IS GENERALLY PAID MINIMUM WAGE. A LICENSED RDA HAS TWO PATHS TO ENTRY WHICH ARE EITHER OF FIFTEEN MONTHS ON THE JOB TRAINING CERTIFIED BY A DENTIST. OR COMPLETION OF A BOARD APPROVED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THE LICENSED RTA EARNS MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE UP TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR IN THE BAY AREA USUALLY WITH BENEFITS WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT POSITION. THIS BILL DOES NOT FIX A BARRIER TO ENTRY PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE ALREADY EXISTS AN ON THE JOB TRAINING OPTION TO BECOME A LICENSED RDA THE BARRIER TO ENTRY IS VERY LOW INTO THE ORAL HEALTH CARE FIELD STAFFING SHORTAGES THAT EXIST CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH INCREASED PAY AND BENEFITS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CAREER LADDER FOR LICENSED RDAS WILL COLLAPSE AS A DENT AS DENTAL OFFICES WILL BE INCENTIVIZED TO INSTEAD HIRE A PERSON WITH NO EXPERIENCE AND INADEQUATE TRAINING TO DO THESE PROCEDURES FOR MINIMUM WAGE WITHOUT BENEFITS. THEREBY MAKING THE LICENSED RDA CATEGORY EVAPORATE SEALANTS ARE THE MAIN PROCEDURES PERFORMED BY LICENSED RDAS. THIS BILL INCENTIVIZES DENTAL OFFICES TO FIRE THE LICENSE RDAS AND REPLACE THEM WITH MINIMUM WAGE AND LYFT AND SIMPLY. PORTABILITY IS ANOTHER ISSUE MEANING A LICENSED RDA CAN COMMAND A GOOD WAGE IF SHE MOVED TO ANOTHER CITY OR OUT OF STATE WITH HER LICENSE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR AN UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT SAID VANCE THROUGH THE CAREER LADDER TO INCREASE PAY AND- BENEFIT OPPORTUNITIES. NOTABLY THERE IS NOT CONSENSUS AMONG DENNIS ABOUT THIS BILL SOME DENNIS SUPPOSED TO GIVING THESE PROCEDURES TO UNLICENSED STAFF. HOWEVER WITH THE LATE NOTICE THAT A REMOTE TELECONFERENCE OPTION WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TODAY DENNIS ALONG WITH DENTAL HYGIENISTS AND DENTAL ASSISTANTS WERE UNABLE TO TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO TO OPPOSE THE BILL IN PERSON. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT CITY HA MUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WE WANT TO OPEN UP TO ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WHO JUST WANNA ADD ON. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M FRED NO- REPRESENTING THE ASSOCIATION OF DENTAL SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. THING NINE ONE BRING BACK TO COLLEGE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. POLITICS DR WEBER. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL AND PLEASE FORGIVE ME IF SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASK YOU- COVERED IN YOUR PRESENTATION I HAD TO RUN OUT FOR ANOTHER- OBLIGATION. I'M WHAT IS THE- FOR ANYONE UP HERE ACTUALLY WHAT IS THE OUR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR A REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT AND A REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST AS FAR AS- THE HOURS THE TIME THE COURSES. THERE ARE. ON THE JOB TRAINING. SORRY THANK YOU I'M ON THE JOB TRAINING FIFTEEN MONTHS- WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COURSEWORK INFECTION CONTROL X. RAY- AND THEN CORONA POLISH TO BE ELIGIBLE TO SIT FOR THE RTA WRITTEN EXAM OR GOING THROUGH AN RDA APPROVED PROGRAM AND THEY'RE USUALLY ABOUT TEN MONTHS IN LENGTH. AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR BELL- FOR THE DENTAL ASSISTANT IS THERE ANY TIME LIMIT THAT THEY NEED TO BE PRACTICING BEFORE THEY CAN- GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. BEFORE DENTAL ASSISTANTS THERE'S ALSO ON THE JOB TRAINING AND THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR INFECTION CONTROL AND OF COURSE ON THAT CALIFORNIA DENTAL PRACTICE ACT WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF BEING ON THE JOB AND ONLY AFTER THEY FINISH THE ON THE JOB TRAINING AND THOSE TWO CERTIFICATIONS WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO TAKE THE COURSES FOR CORONA POLISHING AND THE SEALANT. SO THEY WOULD NOT- BE ABLE TO START PRACTICING WITHIN WEEKS OF BEING HIRED THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE ALL THE NECESSARY TRAINING AND CERTIFICATIONS AND THEN ADDITIONALLY GET CERTIFIED FOR THESE TWO- DUTIES BEFORE THEY CAN BEGIN PRACTICING AND HOW MUCH IS THAT TIME. THE TRAINING THAT THEY GO THROUGH. I'M I AM NOT SURE THE HOURS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT IS IT HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF BEING. HIRED YOU CAN DO THE TWO HOURS OF THAT- IS IT ALREADY A AND THEN THE EIGHT HOURS OF INFECTION CONTROL THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO OKAY. I'M SO THAT'S A TOTAL OF TEN HOURS- AND I'M SORRY. YOU WERE GOING TO THANK I WAS JUST GONNA SAY I CAN ADDRESS THAT YEAH THE INFECTION CONTROL IS EIGHT HOURS. THE DENTAL PRACTICE ACT IS TWO HOURS. THE CROWN OF POLISH IS. TWELVE OKAY SO AGAIN WITH IN A WEEK OR TWO THEY COULD. BE DOING THESE PROCEDURES OKAY. I'M WHAT. WHAT ARE THERE ANY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE- POLISHING THERE ANY COMPLICATIONS. IN THEORY THERE'S COMPLICATIONS THERE COULD BE COMPLICATIONS- BUT SOME OF THE OTHER- TASKS THAT DA'S CAN DO THERE'S ALSO THAT SAME RISK IF SOMEONE IS CARELESS AND THIS IS WHY WE DO ON THE JOB TRAINING WE MAKE SURE THAT THE QUALITY AND THE SAFETY IS THERE WHEN OUR ASSISTANTS ARE PERFORMING THESE DUTIES OF THE V. I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN. SOMEONE HAVE DAMAGE FROM CORONA POLISHING THAT'S- IT'S A IT'S A MINIMALLY INVASIVE- YOU REMOVE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF TO STRUCTURE AND IT'S REALLY THE BIO PHONE THAT YOU'RE REMOVING- IT'S REALLY CONSIDERED COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE. SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS. IF YOU HAD- PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE TOOTH FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF TIME YOU COULD OVER HEAT THE TOOTH BUT NO ONE'S NO ONE'S POLISHING THAT WAY YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S ON A TIME SCHEDULE NO ONE'S GOING TO HOLD. AN INSTRUMENT ON A TOOTH FOR TWO MINUTES TO COOK THE POP THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENS ALSO THERE IS A SPECIFIED TIME. THERE'S MORE IS THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIED TIME BUT IN PERFORMING THAT DUTY YOU REALLY YOU CLEAN THE SURFACE OF THE TOOTH YOU'RE CONSTANTLY MOVING IN YOUR MOVING IN GENTLE CIRCLES AND YOU'RE MOVING. RATHER QUICKLY IF ANYONE HAS EVER HAD A DENTAL CLEANING YOU KNOW. THEY'RE NOT SITTING THERE IN ONE SPOT FOR TWO MINUTES OR OR FOR A PROLONGED AMOUNT OF TIME WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO DO DAMAGE. OKAY AND SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE COULD BE THERMAL DAMAGE WHICH WOULD LEAD TO NERVE DAMAGE. IN THEORY I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN OKAY. I'M CAN YOU TELL HOW MUCH PRESSURE SOMEONE IS APPLYING BY WATCHING THEM. YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU AN SEE THE COP FLEXING OR THE IF YOU'RE USING A PERSONAL TO PRO FOR YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THE BRUSH BRISTLES ARE FLEXING. OKAY AND WHAT IS THE COMPLICATIONS OF STEALING. SEALANTS- BASICALLY THE BIGGEST RESO THE PHOSPHORIC ACID ETCH THAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS NO GREATER DAMAGE THAN YOU YOUR PATIENT WHO'S DRINKING COCA COLA MOUNTAIN DEW AND SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND ACIDIC BEVERAGES ON THE REGULAR THE- THAT PROLONGED DAMAGE- THAT A PATIENT MIGHT DO TO THEMSELVES IS GREATER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE FROM. I. TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SECOND ASSETS- YES IT ADD SHE WANTS THE CYLINDERS ON THE CEILING AND THE BONDING AGENT ARE FILLING IN THE STRUCTURE THAT HAS BEEN ACID EDGE SO NOW THAT THAT STRUCTURE IS COMPLETELY PROTECTED. THE ASSET AS JUST PREPARES THE TWO STRUCTURES SO THAT IT CAN BONTA THOSE AGENTS ON. THE ACTUAL POLISH OR THE SEALANT THAT IS PUTTING IS FLOWN INTO THE- FLOWED INTO THE GROOVES OF THE TOOTH AND CREATES IT CREATES A SEAL SO THAT BACTERIA CANNOT GET INTO THOSE DEEP GROOVES AND BECAUSE THE CAT. THAT THE SOCIALLY LIKE A TED TO MAKE IT LIKE LAYMAN'S TERMS IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MANICURE. EXCEPT APPLIED TO THE TWO MEN TRAPPED IN THE PROPER WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT BACTERIA CONTAMINATION IS ELIMINATED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN- SEALED TO SEAL OUT- THE POSSIBILITY OF- ACTOR GETTING INTO INTO THE TO THINK HOUSING- CAPPY. OKAY SO. WITH THE- POLISHING THEIR IS A RISK OF- THERMAL DAMAGE EADING TO NERVE DAMAGE WITH THE SEALANT THERE IS. YOU'RE USING SOMETHING ACIDIC SO THERE IS THAT RISK THEIR- SORRY IF YOU. IF I CAN JUST ADD ALL OF WHICH DOCTOR JUST SAID IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE BUT AGAIN THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT WE'RE TAKING SOMEBODY WHO'S NEVER EVEN WORKED POTENTIALLY IN A PATIENT'S MOUTH WITH MINIMAL TRAINING BEING ABLE TO DO THESE DUTIES WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SAID WE ARE TAKING AWAY SERVICES OF THE ENAMEL THAT YOU CAN'T GET BACK TO THESE ARE. IRREVERSIBLE DUTIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE DONE BY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO RENTS AN ASPIRATE MUCH LAST. USE THE HAND PIECE IN THE MOUTH AND PHOSPHORIC ACID. RIGHT OKAY WELL MY QUESTION I WAS GOING TO BE SO WE TALKED ABOUT- THE POTENTIAL NERVE DAMAGE WE TALKED ABOUT THE AESTHETIC. AND YOU HAD STATED BEFORE THAT DENTAL ASSISTANTS HAVE SIMILAR RISK WITH THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO LOOKING AT WHAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO WHAT IS. WHAT IS IT THAT THEY DO NOW THAT HAS SIMILAR RISKS TO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING OR WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING. CHAIR PLACING AND REMOVING RUBBER DAMS- THERE'S A CLAMP THAT COULD IF IMPROPERLY PLACED IMPINGE ON THE TISSUE. I AM PLACING AND THAT WOULD CAUSE NERVE DAMAGE NOT NERVE DAMAGE BUT WOULD COME BECAUSE- DAMAGE TO THE GUM TISSUE AND- APERI DONNELLY COMPROMISE PATIENT THAT TISSUE DAMAGE COULD BE LONGER TERM- SAME THING WITH PLACING WEDGING AND REMOVING MATRICES FOR SORT OF PRODUCT- PROCEDURES THAT- THOSE. METERS FANS CAN OPERATE THE GUM TISSUE- TEMPORARILY AND IT HEALS- INTER AURAL IMPRESSIONS- THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE A PATIENT COULD GAG. ON THE MATERIAL IF NOT DONE PROPERLY AND EVEN IF DONE PROPERLY AND THAT APPLIES TO ANY OF THESE I EAT ANY OF THESE PROCEDURES DONE PROPERLY STILL RUN RISKS OF SMALL THINGS. HAPPENING WITH THAT ARE USUALLY- SOMETHING THAT THE PATIENT CAN RECOVER FROM WITH MINIMAL INCIDENT- AND THAT'S THE SAME MATT THAT WOULD GO THE SAME WAY AS- PROFI POLISHING. SO THE PATIENT GAGS WHAT ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ASPIRATION. ASPIRATION VOMITING- ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWING MATERIAL THAT'S. I'M ADDITIONALLY REMOVING ORTHODONTIC SEPARATOR SOMETIMES ORTHODONTIC SEPARATORS CAN BE MISPLACED AND GO TO START TO FIRE SUBSTANTIVELY- REMOVING SUTURES YOU COULD ACCIDENTALLY INJURE A PATIENT REMOVING SUTURES BY I ACCIDENTALLY CUTTING THEM. I'M SO ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO TRAIN OUR ASSISTANCE IN AND WE AS THE DENTISTS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND LIABLE FOR ANY OF THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPEN. I LIKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT STRENGTHENS THOSE THOSE PROTECTIONS ABOUT THE TYPE OF TRAINING AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THESE PROCEDURES WITHIN A MONTH OF HIRING THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRAINING ON THE JOB. MAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DEVELOP BUT THE- DIFFICULTY WE HAVE IS THESE ASSISTANCE CAN GOING GET THESE CERTIFICATES AND LEARN THIS SKILL AND THESE ARE SKILLS THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDED BY THE DENTAL ASSISTANT PROGRAMS- THEY TAKE THESE THESE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AND THEN THEY CAN'T USE THEM ON THE JOB. AND SO WE ACTUALLY SEE IN IN- ENVELOPING THIS N. THAT DA SCOPE WILL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO USE THOSE SKILLS AND ADVANCE SO THAT THEY HAVE MORE OF A SKILL DEVELOPMENT LADDER INTO GO INTO BECOMING AN RGA. WE WANT MORE RT AS WE DON'T WANT HIM TO HAVE- LET'S TRAIN DA'S WE WANT OUR DÍAS TO BE AS FULLY TRAINED AND FUNCTIONAL AND LICENSE AS POSSIBLE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS CREATES A PATHWAY. FOR DEVELOPING THOSE SKILLS IN A STEPWISE MANNER SO THAT THEY CAN- EVENTUALLY MOVE FORWARD INTO RDA POSITIONS AND GREATER RESPONSIBILITY. YOUR DENTAL IS THE HAVE- THE REQUIREMENT TO DO CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR SKILLS ARE- CAN YOU KNOW UP TO PAR BECAUSE YOUR RESIDENT AS I'M SURE YOU DO AS A PHYSICIAN I DO- I'M- SURE AS AS THE- RDAS. THEY THEY HAVE TO. DO DENTAL ASSISTANTS HAVE TO DO CONTINUING EDUCATION COURSES TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THEY'RE UP ON THE LATEST AND GREATEST. MAYBE SOMETHING WALKIE WITH ANATOMY THAT THERE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE PICKED UP ON IN THERE- ON THE JOB TRAINING. THEN ASSISTANCE DO NOT HAVE ANY REQUIRED COURSEWORK. THEY DON'T HAVE TO AFTER THEY'VE TAKEN THE INFECTION CONTROL IN THE DPA THEIR FIRST YEAR THEY NEVER HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN. IF THEY STAY IN THE D. A. CATEGORY- THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND IN FACT THE DENTAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER. THE UNLICENSED DENTAL ASSISTANT AND THAT IS ONE OF OUR OTHER CONCERNS HERE IS THAT THEY'D BE ABLE TO DO THESE PROCEDURES AND NOT HAVE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION BECAUSE ARE NOT LICENSED- YOU KNOW I AM. CONCERNED WITH- EXPANDING THE SCOPE WITHOUT AYE EXPANDING. TRAINING AND TO HAVE COMPARABLE TRAINING- AND THAT'S WHY I BEGAN WITH ASKING WHAT IS YOU KNOW THE TIME REQUIREMENT TO BECOME- A REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT ARE REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST I UNDERSTAND WANTING TO TEACH AND HOW PEOPLE GROW IN THE FIELD AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PROCESS FOR THAT- I WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT THE OVERALL- REASONING FOR THE BILL WISE BECAUSE I WOULD AS I WAS READING IT WAS STATING SOMETHING ABOUT THERE BEING A SHORTAGE. OF DENTAL ASSISTANTS. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW EXPANDING THEIR SCOPE WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DENTAL ASSISTANT- MAYBE YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT AND IN THE OPENING STATEMENT AND I JUST MISSED IT BUT I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW. EXPANDING THE SCOPE IS GOING TO BRING MORE PEOPLE IN. I'M IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH. NEEDING MORE PEOPLE IN THE OFFICE TO DO THESE PROCEDURES SO THAT THE DENTIST CAN. YOU KNOW QUICKLY SEE PATIENTS AND GET THEM IN AND OUT. YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENIST IN YOUR REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT SO. I I'M NOT SURE IF EXPANDING SCOPE OF PRACTICE TO SOMETHING ESPECIALLY FOR PROCEDURE THAT DOES HAVE RISK. I'M IS. THE BEST IDEA BUT I AM DEFINITELY- YOU KNOW WILLING TO CONTINUE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BELL AND HOPEFULLY SHE WILL BE AND CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH- SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF OPPOSITION TO. COME TO A HAPPY MEDIUM THANK YOU ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES. YES MR LEE. I DON'T HAVE A ESTARÁ PROBING AS DR WEBER DOES ABOUT QUESTIONS BUT I JUST GONNA SAY THAT- I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OPPOSITION IS RAISING I'M PERSONALLY SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF PERSONAL TRAUMA FROM DOING ON DENTISTRY I HAVE GENETICALLY TERRIBLE TEETH AND TERRIBLE LIKE JHANSI BROTHER DENTISTRY PROFESSIONALS AND WEARING MASKS YOU CAN LOOKAT MY TEETH RIGHT NOW. BUT SO I HAVE AND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENTIALS POKE AND PROD ME AND I UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE THAT PATIENT SAFETY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS COME THROUGH A LOT OF THE STUFF AND STILL GOES THROUGH- BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION FIGURES OUT I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT. WHAT THE- SUPERVISING DENTIST REALLY ON THE HOOK IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I HOPE SHE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT. PATIENT SAFETY. AND COMFORT OF COURSE. IS THE HEART OF THIS AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY FOR YOU. THANK YOU SO OVERLY ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES. AS A MEMBER CREE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT JUST TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IS REALLY QUICKLY AS WE LAID OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- 87% OF DENTAL OFFICES REPORTED HAVING THE DIFFICULTY HIRING DENTAL ASSISTANTS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WERE CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT PASSED THE REGISTERED DENTAL ASSISTANT EXAM IN CALIFORNIA. BUT LAST YEAR ALONE THAT NUMBER WAS ONLY EIGHTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB IN PROVIDING HEALTH CARE AND INCREASING HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS OF INCOME OR LOCATION. DENTAL CARE IS PART OF THAT SOLUTION AND YOU KNOW GOING TO THE DENTIST ALREADY AS STATED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE IS TRAUMATIC ENOUGH- ESPECIALLY I WOULD SAY PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY IS ONE OF THE HARDEST OF FIELDS OUT THERE- DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK FOR CHILDREN AND REALLY FOR ALL ALL ADULTS THAT- WE FEEL INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE ALREADY AND FOR. THOSE OF YOU THAT THAT KNOW ME AND KNOW ME WELL KNOW THAT I WOULD NEVER PUT A BILL FOR THAT ACTUALLY JEOPARDIZES THE WORKFORCE OR JOBS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS TYPE OF WORK THAT'S NOT WHERE I COME FROM IT'S NOT MY PHILOSOPHY NOR MY VALUES. WHAT ARE MY VALUES THOUGH ARE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M SAD TO REPORT THAT DESPITE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION THEY INITIALLY SAID YES WE WILL WORK WITH YOU AND THEN COMPLETELY DECLINED SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD WAY TO DO WORK OR POLICY. AND SO- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MAKE THAT CHAIN OF ACCOUNTABILITY INCREDIBLY CLEAR ONE OF THE INITIAL CONCERNS WAS LIABILITY THE AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK TO MAKE THAT THE DENTISTS RESPONSIBLE AND THE LIABILITY IS A HUGE. STEP FORWARD AND COULD AND ACTUALLY FINDING THAT SOLUTION WE DID THAT ANDYET HERE WE FIND OURSELVES YET THEY'RE STILL HUMAN GLOOM ABOUT THE WORK FORCE AND WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE THE FACT IS THAT WE NEED MORE MORE PEOPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR. A PARTICULAR SPACE. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL THAT TO. SO OF I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION FOR THIS WORK MY OFFICE THE COMMITTEE. MANY STAFF FOR. A REALLY GETTING INTO THIS THIS ISSUE AND TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO AT THE END OF THE DAY BE ABLE TO ACCESS. GOING TO THE DENTIST AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU A SUMMER THAT SOMEONE NUMBER CARILLO AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL- I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WOULD AYE AND IT YOU KNOW COMMENT WAS MADE ABOUT THE LATE NOTICE OF NO PHONE TESTIMONY THERE WASTHEY NOTICED OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL- AND SO I. WONDER IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE PHONE TESTIMONY TODAY DUE TO I. T. LIMITATIONS. BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED PLENTY OF COMMENTS THROUGH OUR ADVOCATE PORTAL. AND WE ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO FEELS THEY HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO COMMENT TO DO SO TO STILL SUBMIT COMMENTS. THROUGH THE ADVOCATE PORTAL- WHILE WHILE I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS STILL DISAGREEMENT. AS TO WHETHER THE PROCEDURES UNDER THIS BILL ARE REVERSIBLE. THERE WILL ALSO HAVE TO BE ONE OR MORE SUPERVISING DENTISTS WHO ARE PUTTING THEIR LICENSE ON THE LINE. THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED- THERE SHOULD BE AN EVEN CLEARER CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY AND THEREFORE MORE PRESSURE ON THE SUPERVISING DENTIST OVERSEE THE DENTAL ASSISTANTS. THAT SAID I KNOW THERE ARE STILL OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS. OF REGARDING THE RDA WORKFORCE I WANT TO RECOMMEND THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR. CONTINUING CONTINUE DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH THE OPPOSITION AS THE BILL MOVES FOR FROM WHAT I SAW. THERE IS A DESIRE FROM EVERYBODY TO TIM. DID YOU KNOW HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO. I ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY WHO'S PRESENTED TODAY TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER- TO TRY TO ADDRESS ANY ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT EXIST. LASTLY I UNDERSTAND THE DENTAL BOARD HAS NOT HAD A CHANCE TO FORMALLY REVIEW THE BILL. SO WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE CONVERSATIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. WITH THOSE CONSIDERATIONS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITH THE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS. AT THIS TIME- AND WE. NEED A MOTION. AND A SECOND. THE LEFT GOT A MOTION. AND SECOND GOT A SECOND.
