COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. TO THE

AUTHOR- I LIKE THE IDEA GENERAL

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:33.612
GIST OF. OF WHAT IS. BEING IT

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.214
BEING ATTEMPTED HERE IN FACT MY

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.583
OFFICE NINE- WE HAD- A BILL THAT

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.252
WE WERE WORKING ON- THAT HAD

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:43.656
SOME SIMILARITIES TO THIS- BUT

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:44.623
I'M I WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.293
THAT THERE WAS CLARITY ON ONE

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:50.863
ISSUE IN PARTICULAR- BECAUSE I

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.498
THINK. HE ANALYSIS AND MAYBE

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:55.634
EVEN THE WAY IN PACKAGED- BY

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.570
PRESENTATION A WAR BY OTHERS.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.939
IS THAT WERE REFERRING TO IT AS

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:02.675
FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. NOW THE BILL

00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:06.612
INDICATES. LET'S SEE WHERE IT IS

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:09.582
ON. THIS WOULD BE THE ONE TO

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:12.218
THREE FOURTH PARAGRAPH THIS BILL

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.352
WOULD PROHIBIT A FOREIGN

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:16.622
GOVERNMENT. ART AND BECAUSE I

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:17.756
THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.658
SEEING IS THAT FOREIGN

00:14:19.725 --> 00:14:22.595
GOVERNMENT IS BEING. USED IN A

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.030
WAY THAT IS IDENTIFYING IT AS

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.533
FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. IS THERE A

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.835
DISTINCTION WITH THE AUTHOR'S

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.471
INTENT ON THAT ISSUE YES THE

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:35.407
DENTAL OF THE ILL IS GUEST ON

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:39.011
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. NOW EIGHT

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.879
MAKING PART OF THE REASON WHY

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.448
FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IS KIND OF

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.817
BEING BROUGHT UP IS THAT. ONE OF

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.318
THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW OUR

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:47.920
TEAM HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING ON IS

00:14:47.987 --> 00:14:49.922
A CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY ACT AT

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:51.657
LEAST WHAT KIND OF WATCHING.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:53.692
WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WAY IT'S

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:57.529
GOING TO GO. AND PART OF IT IS

00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:58.530
THAT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE.

00:14:58.597 --> 00:14:59.999
THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:03.068
IMPROVEMENT ON. UNDERSTANDING

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:05.738
WHERE A CORPORATION. LIKE WHO

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:10.542
THEIR BENEFICIAL OWNERS ARE. AT

00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:12.778
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT-

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:16.448
UP THE SHELL CORPORATIONS FOR

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:18.450
EXAMPLE YOU THINK OF THEM LIKE

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.619
OPENING UP AND SOME LIKE THE

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.288
BAHAMAS OR SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:24.223
RIGHT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.991
SHELL CORPORATIONS ARE BEING

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:28.827
FORMED RIGHT HERE IN THE U. S.

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:31.530
AND SO. YOU VERY WELL HAVE A

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:35.334
CORPORATION THAT IS- THE

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.203
CALIFORNIA CORPORATION RIGHT AND

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.606
IT COULD VERY WELL BE OWNED BY A

00:15:40.673 --> 00:15:45.477
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT- SO IT SOLD

00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:47.446
THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON FOREIGN

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:49.548
GOT ANTS BUT I THINK THAT WITH

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.117
THE CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY. ACT

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.218
LEGISLATION IN THE

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.454
IMPLEMENTATION OF IT I THINK

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.656
THAT THAT WILL KIND OF BRING TO

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.992
LIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE ASKED TO

00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:03.862

WANT TO HONE IN ON THIS BECAUSE

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.572
THIS IS. A MYTH ISSUE WILL MOVE

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:17.643
TOWARD- YOU MAY WISH TO I'M NOT

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.379
CERTAIN IT'S IN THE FORM OF A

00:16:20.446 --> 00:16:25.484
RESPECT TO PRESIDENT. RIGHT

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:29.021

. AS ONE ENTERS PRESS. CAN THE

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.594
END REPORT THAT IS BEING ASKED

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.963
HERE- IS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.431
IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAT IT

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.634
ALSO INCLUDES. AFFILIATED STATE

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:47.673
OWNED ENTERPRISE. SO I THE

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.042

HONAN IT'S A SEPARATE IT'S A

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.053
SEPARATE ISSUE RIGHT THAT HAS TO

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.588
DO FALL. IT'S NOT PART OF THIS

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.156
BILL BUT THE CORPORATE

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:07.559
TRANSPARENCY ACT WILL HAVE WHAT

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:09.194

FOCUSED IN ON CHINA BUT I MEAN.

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:18.790

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.822
WITNESS ALSO MENTIONED- I DON'T

00:19:50.889 --> 00:19:52.291
KNOW THERE WAS A WORK FOR BUT

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:52.758

ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:24.756
DIFFERENCE COULD BE A POSSIBLY

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.525
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.360
THE CONCERNS. AND I'LL CONCLUDE

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:30.562
MY- THAT CENTER GLAZER CHURCHES

WHICH IS TO COMMENT FURTHER-

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.334
THIS IS A PROHIBITION. THIS IS A

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.536
VERY SERIOUS STEP. THIS IS

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:39.304
UNLIKE WHAT THE FEDERAL

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.939
AUTHORITIES HAVE. FEDERAL

00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:42.541

ENTERPRISE OF AG RELATED ASSETS

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:01.994
. AND I THINK THAT IS IT THERE

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.895
IS A POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THIS

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.331
BILL WORK IN THE RIGHT WAY I

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.933
