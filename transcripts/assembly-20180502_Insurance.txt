I JUST WANT TO INDICATE THAT. OUR INTEREST IN CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE ON THIS BILL IT. ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF THIS BILL IS REFERENCING. CUT HOMEOWNERS TO INDEPENDENT SHIRTS AGENTS SO. WE APPRECIATE THE CONFIDENCE. IN OUR ORGANIZATION AND OUR OUR FOLKS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SURE MICKEY REPRESENTING THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US WE LOOKFORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM OUGHT TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE.

KATHERINE HEPBURN AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION LIKE TACKLE MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS TO GET IT OFF. CARE COST PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION WE ALSO MARK COMFORTABLE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AUTHOR THINKING. MICHAEL BOHLIN WITH MEDTRONIC AYE WERE THE LARGEST PRIVATE NINE HOSPITAL EMPLOYER IN CINEMA COUNTY WE LOST. FIFTY TWO OF OUR EMPLOYEES LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRE WE SUPPORT THE BILL. ALRIGHT ANY ERA SO. THE MORE THE REMARK TWEETERS THEN. OTHER CATEGORIES MISTER WOULD. SO. TRAINERS THAT OPPOSITION RATE GREAT. RUN GOOD GOOD. WERE OPERATING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE MISTER BIGELOW. WHILE WE WAIT FOR A QUORUM TO ARRIVE OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. GO AHEAD AND I DO AND MAYBE THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT CAN CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION BUT ON THAT PAGE THREE LINE SEVEN TO THIRTEEN THERE'S THIS LANGUAGE SHOULD AGENTS HOW DISCLOSE THE HOME WHERE THE POLICIES FROM OTHER INSURERS. AND WITH IT IF I WAS JUST DUMB. GLANCING READING THAT I THINK WILL ARE. THE OPPOSITE AGENT REQUIRE TO TO GIVE INFORMATION ON A COMPETITOR'S PRODUCT BECAUSE THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE ANTI COMPETITIVE IT WOULD SEEM SEEM STRANGE. AND SO WHEN SOME CLARIFICATION ON ON THAT. GO AHEAD SIR. I GET. THE THAT AS EVERYBODY JUST NOTED. THERE IS REFINEMENT OF FOOT. ON THE BILL. THE INTENTION ISN'T REALLY FOR AGENT NUMBER ONE TO SELL AGED NUMBER TWOS. PRODUCT IT'S. REALLY TO MAKE A REFER ALL. MY COMPANY CAN'T PROVIDE YOU THE INSURANCE. GO TALK TO THOSE GUYS. MOON THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO AND AND THAT PROVISION BY THE WAY SUNSETS IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN FAVOR OF. THE FINDER TOOL THAT THE WITNESSES TESTIFY TO IT IN SO WITH THAT BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE HERE IS THE AGENT SHALL. IT'S NOT SHOULD. IT'S SHALL AND SO. THAT PUTS THE AGING KIND OF AN INTERESTING POSITION IF THEY DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER OF IN OTHER PARTS OF AGAIN HOW DOES THAT WORK IN PRACTICE. WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT THESE POLICIES EXIST OUT THERE? THAT IF CONSUMERS WERE ARE WILLING TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THEM SO WE'RE KIND OF JUST SAYING OKAY IF THEY EXIST THEN THEN THEN HELP PEOPLE FIND THOSE POLICIES. I AT THE END OF THE DAY. IN AYE I DO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THESE HOW A FIFTY PERCENT PLUS POLICY WOULD BE PRICE BUT THE OTHER DAY I WOULD THINK THAT. THAT. THE COMPANY'S DANTA STAND TO GAIN ON THIS BY BY HAVING THESE HAVE THESE PEOPLE INSURED BUT WE HEARD FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT THAT THOSE POLICIES EXIST WERE SO WEIRD. SO THAT'S THE CASE HELP US FIND THAT IN THAT THAT LANGUAGE AND THAT'S FINE WHICH WE'RE WORKING ON WE'VE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. AND THE I THINK THIS IS THAT LANGUAGE IS A BRIDGE UNTIL WE HAVE THIS TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW THE CONSUMER TO DEFINE IT. BIDED ON THEIR OWN. SO YOU'RE STILL NOT GOING TO WORK WITH THOSE GUYS DIMENSIONAL I DEFINITELY ARE A WITH A NUMBER OF THE BILL. AS WE CAN TEMPLE RIGHT. I APPRECIATE YOUR POPPED UP. MR QUITE NOT QUITE YET WE NEED ONE MORE. OKAY. JEFF. A QUORUM WHILE THE QUORUM IS A. ARRIVING HERE MISTER FRAZIER HAS QUESTION. AND NORMALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT PUTTING THE BURDEN ON ON A. DECLARATIONS OF DISCLOSURES WE PUT ON STATE AGENCIES. SO SHOULD THE REFERENCE FLOW OF THE ASIAN BEAT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SO THAT THEY CAN BE THE THE LISTER OF WHO CAN OR CAN'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE INSURANCE FOR THEM WELL THAT'S WHAT THE TOOL COMES AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE BUILDING THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES IS TO BUILD THE TOOL. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE INTERIM TO HELP THE CONSUMER IS GOING TO THESE I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE DO TECHNOLOGY THINGS IN THE STATE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. QUICKLY. AND SO IT TAKES A DIFFICULT TIME TO BUILD THIS YEAH AND AGAIN PUTTING SHALL. THE BURDEN ON A BUSINESS OWNER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT DEPENDING ON. THEIR ABILITY YOU KNOW. HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE IS FOR SELLING? AND THEN PUTTING IN THIS RESPONSIBILITY ON THEM ALSO. IT AND THEY'RE NOT MAKING MONEY OFF THAT POLICIES GOOD IT DID AND IT DOES BOTHER ME. SO I I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE END IN INDUSTRY. IN AYE I'M LOOKING AT LOOK AT FROM MY FOLKS THAT AT THE END IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW. THEIR PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WANT TO BUY EXTENDED COVERAGE AND. THE INDUSTRY'S HOLD THIS THAT THERE IT THAT THESE POLICIES EXIST AND SOME COMPANIES DON'T OFFER THEM SO SO HELP THESE PEOPLE FIND WHAT THEY WANT AND I. YOU KNOW HERE I AM AGAIN I THINK THAT UNDERSTAND THEY ARE AVAILABLE THEN THE DEPARTMENT TURNS ALSO DOES KNOW THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE QUOTE YOU WITH YOU. YOU'D BE SURPRISED THERE ARE THERE A LOT OF INSURANCE COMPANIES SMALLER SMALLER COMPANIES THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED PRIOR TO THIS FACTOR. QUITE FRANKLY AND SO ON THE DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA NINE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF BEING REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT. INSURANCE AT PARKMAN KNOWS OKAY SO I MEAN THAT'S ONE SEND THIS THEY SHOULD BE THE. THE PROVIDER OF INFORMATION. IN THE END THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. LOOKING FOR TO SOONER THAN LATER. YEP. IN MISTER HER RAIL ON THAT POINT DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE READY TO. OFFER THAT SERVICE SAW ON THE. THE OF THE PREDICTED SCHEDULE YET MISTER CHAIRMAN AND PARTLY MISTER CHAIRMAN. THE NUMBER BUT JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT A NUMBER OF COMPANIES AFFECT MOST COMPANIES OFFER A FIFTY PERCENT REPLACEMENT COST. EXTENSION. THERE'S A UP RELATIVE HANDFUL OF THOSE NOTABLE MARKETERS THAT DOWN. BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS UNDER COMMISSIONER JONES TO BUILD UP THE CAPACITY. SELECT CONSUMERS LOOK AT WHAT'S AVAILABLE GENERALLY WITH NO. IT FOR EXAMPLE AN INSURANCE COMPANY MAY HAVE A NUMBER OF PRODUCTS FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AT DIFFERENT LEVELS THIS IS TRUE IN AUDIT WAS WELL FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE MAY BE ONE OR TWO THAT THEY TEND TO SELL MORE OF. SO BUT WE HAVE THE LISTING OF ALL THOSE AND SO. THE SHORT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MISTER CHAIRMAN AS YET WE DO FEEL LIKE THAT TIME FRAME IS IS A GOOD ONE THERE'S SOME. THERE'S LIKE A PAMPHLET REFERENCE IN HERE THAT WERE NOT CRAZY ABOUT WE FEEL LIKE YET BUT WE'RE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH RIGHT THE THAT THE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT ON THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES.

GO AHEAD MR COOLEY ON YOUR BILL. ALRIGHT. PORTER RESEARCHER MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FOUR. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND I'M ACCEPTING THE REQUISITE AMENDMENT. TO MOVE THE PRESUMPTION FROM CONCLUSIVE TO REBUTTABLE. THIS BILL SPECIFIES THE TERMS OF A WRITTEN QUESTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN AN INSURER. AND THE BROKER AGENT ARE PRESUMED TO BE LAWFUL SEPARATE TO A REBUTTABLE CONSUMPTION OUR PRESUMPTION AS. INDICATE WITH THIS AMENDMENT. OF THIS WILL UPHOLD THE VALIDITY OF COMMISSION AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR BROKERS AND AGENTS. OF. AND. JUST A STEPS IS THE RULES FOR HOW THESE WILL GET EVALUATE THE FUTURE. AND IN ANY LITIGATION ARISES. CRITIC PRESUMPTION A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY'RE VALID. AND I'M HERE THEY'VE CRISPER KELLY REPRESENT MERCURY INSURANCE. GO AHEAD SAW MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRIS MCKAY ON BEHALF OF MERCURY INSURANCE GROUP AND. JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT. OUR WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SOMETHING PROACTIVE. A MERCURY WAS SUBJECT TO A CHALLENGE ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS AGO FROM A GROUP OF AGENTS CONCERNING THEIR COMMISSION AGREEMENTS. AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE OTHER AGAINST AN INSURER SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN BOTH INSTANCES INSURERS ONE AT THE TRIAL COURT LEVEL. BUT THE EFFORT IS IS TO DO SOMETHING PROACTIVE NOW WE WORKED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT IS CURRENTLY CONTAINED IN THE BILL WITH THE. A GROUP REPRESENTING MOST PRODUCERS. IT IS. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF SUGGESTED A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. OBVIOUSLY THE. AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THAT AMENDMENT SO I THINK THAT THE. OPPOSITION THAT WAS DROPPED ABOUT EIGHTEEN HOURS AGO I BELIEVE. RAISING SOME CONCERNS. ABOUT THE SOMEHOW INOCULATING OF THESE AGREEMENTS I THINK IS ON WARRANTED ESPECIALLY WITH A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. YOU ARE. A. ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE OPPOSITION OF THAT WAS DROPPED INDICATED THAT THAT THIS MIGHT APPEAR TO BE IN DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER THIS IS THE LANGUAGE. WE WORKED ON OF THE LANGUAGE AS I INDICATED PREVIOUSLY WITH AGENTS AND BROKERS. AND. SO THERE IS NO EFFORT TO CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE ABSENT THE AMENDMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED IN THE AUTHOR TOOK SO. WITH THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD. FARTHER PERSONS HERE WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. ARE THERE ANY PERSONS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK AGAINST THE BILL. AND THEN THERE'S A TWEENER.
