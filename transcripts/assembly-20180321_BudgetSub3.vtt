00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:20.665 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS

00:38:19.564 --> 00:38:21.800 region:rollup2
TO RENEW.

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:23.735 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.336 region:rollup2
PLANNING TO IMPROVE.

00:38:23.735 --> 00:38:26.771 region:rollup2
AND MAKE MORE TIMELY A REVIEW

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:29.541 region:rollup2
OF REQUESTS.

BENEFITS.

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:37.015 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS.

00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:39.217 region:rollup2
UP WHEN YOU SAY IMPROVE BENEFITS

00:38:37.015 --> 00:38:40.785 region:rollup2
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE.

00:38:39.217 --> 00:38:41.886 region:rollup2
OF BUT ON THE LIFELINE SERVICE

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:45.023 region:rollup2
THAT A NUMBER OF.

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:45.590 region:rollup2
TAX AND THAT AND NUMBER CREATE

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:47.091 region:rollup2
A LOT OF GIGABYTES

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:48.760 region:rollup2
THAT YES YES SIR

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:49.561 region:rollup2
BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.496 region:rollup2
WHAT THE.

00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:53.731 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING RATIONALE IS FOR THE

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:55.266 region:rollup2
CURRENT LEVEL AND.

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.367 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:59.537 region:rollup2
TODAY BUT IF THERE ARE ESTIMATES

00:38:59.604 --> 00:39:03.441 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE TO MOVE I THINK IT'S IS

00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:04.609 region:rollup2
IT TWO GIGABYTES.

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:06.878 region:rollup2
UNDER THE LIFE.

00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:08.479 region:rollup2
DATA A IN THE DATA PLAN UNDER

00:39:06.878 --> 00:39:10.248 region:rollup2
LIFELINE IS THAT RIGHT.

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:11.115 region:rollup2
SO JUST GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS

00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:13.151 region:rollup2
JONATHAN LOCKETS AND I'M A

00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:14.419 region:rollup2
MANAGER IN THE COMMUNICATIONS

00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:14.819 region:rollup2
DIVISION OF THE CPC.

00:39:14.419 --> 00:39:16.821 region:rollup2
TO.

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:18.456 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TO ENSURE QUESTION AND

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:20.491 region:rollup2
TO CLARIFY. THE PROGRAM

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:22.760 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ONLY FUNDS VOICE USAGE

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:24.896 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.531 region:rollup2
CARRIERS HAVE ADDED AND SO THE

00:39:24.896 --> 00:39:28.166 region:rollup2
CURRENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:29.367 region:rollup2
THAT TO RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM.

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:30.501 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY UNDER THE PROGRAM THEY

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:33.104 region:rollup2
HAVE TO OFFER A THOUSAND MORE

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:34.872 region:rollup2
MINUTES AND A THOUSAND MORE TAX.

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:36.641 region:rollup2
MOST YEARS NOW OFFER UNLIMITED

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:38.343 region:rollup2
TAX UNLIMITED VOICE.

00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:40.645 region:rollup2
KERR'S OF ALSO STARTED OFFERING

00:39:38.343 --> 00:39:42.447 region:rollup2
DATA FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS TO

00:39:40.645 --> 00:39:44.249 region:rollup2
COMPETE TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:45.483 region:rollup2
SIGN UP FOR THE SERVICE. AND THE

00:39:44.249 --> 00:39:47.585 region:rollup2
SECOND IS THAT THE FEDERAL

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:48.920 region:rollup2
LIFELINE PROGRAM HAS OF SUBSIDY

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:50.755 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OF MINE TWENTY FIVE A

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.990 region:rollup2
MONTH TO QUALIFY FOR THAT THEY

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:53.291 region:rollup2
HAVE TO OFFER DATA.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.559 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE THAT FEDERAL

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:56.127 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES SO WHATWE'RE SEEING

00:39:54.559 --> 00:39:57.528 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:59.030 region:rollup2
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THE

00:39:57.528 --> 00:40:00.365 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:02.634 region:rollup2
COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMERS IN

00:40:00.365 --> 00:40:04.068 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA CARES OF VOLUNTARILY

00:40:02.634 --> 00:40:05.436 region:rollup2
ADDING MORE DATA TO THEIR

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:07.505 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:09.240 region:rollup2
BUT. THE STATE PROGRAMS NOT

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:12.977 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FUND DATA USAGE AT THIS

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:14.746 region:rollup2
POINT IN TIME.

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:16.014 region:rollup2
I SEE A SO WHY IF AT SOME POINT

00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:18.116 region:rollup2
YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME ANALYSIS

00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:20.318 region:rollup2
ON WHAT. A WHETHER YOU THINK

00:40:18.116 --> 00:40:21.786 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:20.318 --> 00:40:23.421 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:25.290 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING THE

00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:26.925 region:rollup2
PUBLIC'S NEEDS?

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.259 region:rollup2
AND TO.

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:30.161 region:rollup2
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BOB RAISE

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:32.230 region:rollup2
THE BAR ON THAT?

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:34.999 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:37.135 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:38.903 region:rollup2
TO HAVE FOR ANY COMMENT FROM

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:40.371 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL.

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:41.472 region:rollup2
FINANCE RUST BROWN WITH THE LA

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.507 region:rollup2
NOTES THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED THE

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.541 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES FOR THE LIFELINE

00:40:42.507 --> 00:40:45.043 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT WERE PROVIDED IN

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
JANUARY FOR NOW WE THINK THAT

00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:47.779 region:rollup2
THE REASONABLE BUT AS THE

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.080 region:rollup2
COMMISSION MENTIONED OTHER WILL

00:40:47.779 --> 00:40:51.516 region:rollup2
BE UPDATED ESTIMATES IN MAY AND

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.150 region:rollup2
SO. A WE WILL OF COURSE BE%

00:40:51.516 --> 00:40:53.384 region:rollup2
TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THOSE AT

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:55.520 region:rollup2
THAT TIME.

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:57.488 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.324 region:rollup2
MY EARLIER QUESTION.

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:01.793 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK ONE OF.

00:40:59.324 --> 00:41:03.328 region:rollup2
A IT IT'S INCONTROVERTIBLE TODAY

00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:05.129 region:rollup2
THAT TO ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:08.399 region:rollup2
AHEAD IN THE WORLD IS.

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:10.068 region:rollup2
TO HAVE ACCESS TO A.

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:12.203 region:rollup2
A NEW MOBILE TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:14.739 region:rollup2
WORKS AND DATA AND COMPUTER

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:15.540 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AND AND AND THE LIKE.

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:17.442 region:rollup2
AND SO THE MORE WE CAN

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.976 region:rollup2
FACILITATE THAT FOR LOW INCOME

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:20.211 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS.

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:21.512 region:rollup2
.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:23.715 region:rollup2
I THINK THE BETTER THEIR CHANCE

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:24.782 region:rollup2
IN AT AGE OF EXTREME INCOME

00:41:23.715 --> 00:41:26.217 region:rollup2
INEQUALITY THE BETTER THEIR

00:41:24.782 --> 00:41:27.385 region:rollup2
CHANCES GOING TO BE AFFECT

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:29.554 region:rollup2
GETTING ADS ARE REALLY WOULD

00:41:27.385 --> 00:41:30.188 region:rollup2
LIKE TO. SERIOUSLY EXPLORE THAT

00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND SEWER WOULDN'T GO WITH

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:34.759 region:rollup2
IT.

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.561 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE'S NO FURTHER

00:41:34.759 --> 00:41:38.229 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS LET'S MOVE

00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:39.530 region:rollup2

SAFETY ISSUE AND THIS IS A

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:45.269 region:rollup2
COMBINATION OF.

00:41:42.033 --> 00:41:46.771 region:rollup2

PARK AND PROPANE INSPECTIONS

00:42:55.473 --> 00:42:58.142 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE REALLY

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:59.777 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING.

00:42:58.142 --> 00:43:00.311 region:rollup2
WE ONLY INSPECTED THIRTY TWO

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:01.679 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE MOBILE HOME

SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PROGRAM

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:07.919 region:rollup2
PARK INSPECTIONS WERE NOT

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.887 region:rollup2
INSPECTED AYE DEFEATISM CONCEPT

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:11.489 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. THERE'S

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:12.857 region:rollup2

THERE'S THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TOTAL

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:21.332 region:rollup2
BUT WERE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO

00:43:19.764 --> 00:43:21.833 region:rollup2
LOOK AT. THAT FOR THESE

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:23.000 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:24.535 region:rollup2
BECOMING TO.

IT BE IF THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:44.355 region:rollup2
SO IT COMES HIGHLY YOU KNOW

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:50.528 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:51.929 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THEY MAY NOT BE PREPARED.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:59.369 region:rollup2
SO WE ALL KNOW IN TERMS OF THE

SO HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF THE

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:15.352 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO KIND OF

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:16.586 region:rollup2

THE.

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:21.291 region:rollup2
GAS ELECTRIC IS CONNECTIONS

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:22.625 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS ON OUR BOARD

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:24.127 region:rollup2
THAT WE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW AS A

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:25.395 region:rollup2

S. CONNECTION.

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:30.200 region:rollup2
SO OBVIOUSLY RATE ASSISTANCE

THROUGH CARE.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.969 region:rollup2
THE.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:34.304 region:rollup2
IN ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:36.039 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:04:34.304 --> 01:04:37.407 region:rollup2
ARE ONE OF THE WAYS IMMEDIATELY

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:39.008 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN RESPOND BUT THERE

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:40.510 region:rollup2
ALSO IS ANOTHER WAY.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:42.178 region:rollup2
AND THE EMERGING SORT OF CLIMATE

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:44.147 region:rollup2
CHANGE AREA THAT WE HAVE

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:46.449 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AGRICULTURAL

01:04:44.147 --> 01:04:47.350 region:rollup2
AREAS BECAUSE I DO REPRESENT AT.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:48.718 region:rollup2
MICHAEL BUT THE OF A COMPASS

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:50.587 region:rollup2
SCENE OUT WHICH IS A STATEWIDE

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.855 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF FARM HUMAN SERVICE

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.490 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:54.557 region:rollup2
AMENITIES COMMUNITIES LIVE IN

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.392 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:58.862 region:rollup2
EXTREME.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:05:00.397 region:rollup2
HEAT IS UNBEARABLE AND YOU KNOW

01:04:58.862 --> 01:05:02.132 region:rollup2
AGAIN EVEN IN CALIFORNIA YOU

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:03.433 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S VERY VERY COLD THE

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.602 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR.

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:07.203 region:rollup2
SO THE REALITY IS THE LEGISLATOR

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:08.738 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE'S PAID SOME

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:10.240 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.642 region:rollup2
IN TERMS AMENITIES COMMUNITIES

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.144 region:rollup2
THAT DO NOT HAVE NATURAL GAS AS

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:16.079 region:rollup2
A HEATING SOURCE TRYING TO

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:17.447 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. BUT I THINK

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:19.849 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MORE SUCCESSFUL

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:21.484 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OUT THERE. IS THE LOW

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:22.786 region:rollup2
INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:24.120 region:rollup2
THIS CURRENTLY BEING MAGISTRATE

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:26.322 region:rollup2
OR BY CST.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.657 region:rollup2
THIS IS LITERALLY TAKING WHAT

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:30.193 region:rollup2
THE PC HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:31.861 region:rollup2
YEARS WHICH IS THE LEVERAGE OF

01:05:30.193 --> 01:05:33.797 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS FUNDING SILOS.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.597 region:rollup2
THROUGH A RATE ASSISTANCE

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:36.366 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:37.767 region:rollup2
ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE IN

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:39.135 region:rollup2
TERMS OF APPLIANCE A PLACEMENT

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.837 region:rollup2
IN RATHER A STATION.

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:42.038 region:rollup2
NOW BRINGING AND SOLAR.

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:43.439 region:rollup2
AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

01:05:42.038 --> 01:05:44.574 region:rollup2
HARDER TO REACH COMMUNITIES

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.975 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS THAT I

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:47.911 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:49.012 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS

01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:50.447 region:rollup2
AND FARM WORKER POPULATION

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:52.048 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.682 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:55.118 region:rollup2
TO DO IS TO BRING THAT TO YOUR

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:56.653 region:rollup2
ATTENTION. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.620 region:rollup2

01:05:56.653 --> 01:05:59.088 region:rollup2
THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION

PROGRAM.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.724 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD BE A HUGE

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:02.859 region:rollup2
CATASTROPHE OF THAT'S NOT

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:05.929 region:rollup2

ASSISTANCE THERE IS NOTHING ON%

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.636 region:rollup2
THE PLATE RIGHT NOW. THAT WILL

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:16.139 region:rollup2
TAKE ITS PLACE.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:18.007 region:rollup2
IF IT GOES AWAY I THINK THAT.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.541 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT WILL REALIZE THAT

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.976 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO REENGINEER THE

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:21.477 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.879 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE WORK WITH THE

IN THE CONTEXT OF TODAY'S

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
HEARING AND IN RECENT EXECUTIVE

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:19.996 region:rollup2
ORDER YOU'RE REALLY TALKING

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:20.396 region:rollup2
ABOUT LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR

01:08:19.996 --> 01:08:21.764 region:rollup2
A COMPLETE MARKET

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:22.532 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:24.667 region:rollup2
I'M NOT JUST INCREMENTAL

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:26.402 region:rollup2
PROGRESS SO TRANSPORTATION AS WE

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.770 region:rollup2
KNOW. I ACCOUNT FOR THE COST

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:29.105 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.440 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GASES AS THE STATE

01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:32.375 region:rollup2
AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE A

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.875 region:rollup2
KEY PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:34.944 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:36.045 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTION.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.647 region:rollup2
I'M FIVE MILLIONS THAT'S WHICH

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:39.115 region:rollup2
WAS LAID OUT BY THE GOVERNOR IN

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.583 region:rollup2
HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER BY TWENTY

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:43.152 region:rollup2
THIRTY IS A CHECKPOINT ON THE

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:44.520 region:rollup2
WAY TO A FULLY ZAB FUTURE. THE

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.255 region:rollup2
REALLY TO GET THERE WE NEED TO

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.657 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL THINGS TO HAPPEN

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:50.193 region:rollup2
FIRST WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE VERY

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:51.761 region:rollup2
EXCITED TO BUY. BY PURCHASE OR

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:53.596 region:rollup2
LEASE OR OPERATE THESE VEHICLES.

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:55.765 region:rollup2
AND SECOND WE NEED THE ABILITY

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:57.100 region:rollup2
TO CHARGE IN FUEL THESE VEHICLES

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.967 region:rollup2
CONVENIENTLY.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.601 region:rollup2
I WANT TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.869 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:01.671 region:rollup2
TO THEM.

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:03.573 region:rollup2
TO THE MARKET IS DIRECTLY LINKED

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:04.707 region:rollup2
A VEHICLE UPDATE I'M HE GETS

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.942 region:rollup2
INTO IT OF A LOT OF WAYS LIKE

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:08.378 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD YOU BUY A CAR THAT YOU

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:09.445 region:rollup2
CAN'T FUEL. BUT IT'S ALSO SHOWN

01:09:08.378 --> 01:09:11.247 region:rollup2
IN A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:12.081 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS THAT HAVE MORE PUBLIC

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:14.250 region:rollup2
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:15.451 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY. HAVE A HIGHER

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:17.587 region:rollup2
UPTAKE OF VEHICLES.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:19.555 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA HAPPENS HAVE ONE

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:20.857 region:rollup2
OF THE LOWEST RATIOS.

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:22.759 region:rollup2
AND THEY DID IT OF ANY MAJOR

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:24.093 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:25.561 region:rollup2
AND TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:27.697 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO NUMBER OF

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:29.399 region:rollup2
CHARTER SO OUR RATIO IS ABOUT

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
THIRTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO ONE

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.868 region:rollup2
PUBLIC CHARTER SO PUBLIC REPLACE

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:33.770 region:rollup2
CHARGER.

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.737 region:rollup2
AND AS COMPARISON AND OTHER

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.439 region:rollup2
LEADING MARKETS THAT WE COMPARE

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:38.074 region:rollup2
OURSELVES TO LIKE NORWAY HAS A

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.275 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN TO ONE RATIO AND THE

01:09:38.074 --> 01:09:40.610 region:rollup2
NETHERLANDS HAVE ABOUT A FIVE TO

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:42.111 region:rollup2
ONE RATIO.

01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:43.146 region:rollup2
SO THE RATE RATIO CAN VARY

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.547 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON LOCATION IN PARKING

01:09:43.146 --> 01:09:46.015 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY.

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:47.250 region:rollup2
BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.985 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PROBABLY HAS ONE OF

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:50.420 region:rollup2
THE BEST UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT

01:09:48.985 --> 01:09:52.455 region:rollup2
WE NEED IN TERMS OF THAT RATIOS.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.990 region:rollup2
AND SO THE CDC HAS RECENTLY

01:09:52.455 --> 01:09:55.458 region:rollup2
COMPLETED THEIR ANALYSIS THAT'S

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.159 region:rollup2
BEEN YOUR LONG ROBUST ANALYSIS

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.994 region:rollup2
WORKING AT THE NATIONAL

01:09:56.159 --> 01:09:59.529 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB. TO LOOK

01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.863 region:rollup2
FOR A BOTTOM UP HERE LITTLE BIT

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:02.899 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT THIS LATER.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:04.700 region:rollup2
BUT RELIEVED AT THAT THE

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:05.702 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGING NEEDS AS

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.969 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.671 region:rollup2
IT WAS ORGANIZED AROUND ONE

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:11.574 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:12.975 region:rollup2
pCONSUMERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:14.544 region:rollup2
CURRENT DRIVING BEHAVIOR. BASED

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:15.878 region:rollup2
ON ELECTRICITY.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:17.180 region:rollup2
WITH THAT IN MIND WE'RE REALLY

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT W. ELEVEN TO ONE

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:22.351 region:rollup2
RATIO SO. I'M ELEVEN E. VIS TWO

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:24.420 region:rollup2
ONE CHARGER IN THE PUBLIC SO.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:25.855 region:rollup2
WE'VE A LONG WAY TO GO ON THERE

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.690 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN SIDE.

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.324 region:rollup2
DIE WERE FULLY DEPENDENT ON

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:30.293 region:rollup2
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:31.427 region:rollup2
VIABLE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE HOME

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:33.029 region:rollup2
CHARGING SOLUTION YET IN THE

01:10:31.427 --> 01:10:34.230 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE.

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:35.164 region:rollup2
SO YOU LOOK AT THIS THAT YOU

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.733 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE ARE WE THAT THE

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:37.834 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LEVEL IF YOU THROW ALL

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.635 region:rollup2
OF OUR PROGRAMS AT AT AND I'M

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:40.837 region:rollup2
WITH THE UTILITY INVESTMENTS

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:42.138 region:rollup2
WITH THE SETTLEMENTS WITH THE

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:43.940 region:rollup2
ENERGY COMMISSION'S CURRENT

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:44.607 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE GET ABOUT HALF WHERE

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.876 region:rollup2
WE NEED HALF OF THE WAY WE. NEED

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:48.578 region:rollup2
TO GO. OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.545 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THIS CHALLENGE IN

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:51.214 region:rollup2
MIND.

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:52.582 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR BROWN SET OUT IN THIS

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:54.183 region:rollup2

DEVELOP A. TOOL WE CALL E. V. I

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.991 region:rollup2

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:25.828 region:rollup2
THIS LITTLE REVIEWS TO COME UP

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.862 region:rollup2
WITH THESE NUMBERS SO WHEN WE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:28.130 region:rollup2
SAY WE ESTIMATE WE'RE GOING TO

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:29.799 region:rollup2
NEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.067 region:rollup2
CHARGERS TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:32.968 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FAST CHARGERS TO

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:34.070 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS. OF

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:36.305 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLES

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:37.873 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS IS

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:39.475 region:rollup2
WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:40.042 region:rollup2
AND IS TYSON POINTED OUT WERE

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.344 region:rollup2
OUR EXPECTATION IS TO IT IS

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.712 region:rollup2
THAT.

THINK WE HAVE CURRENTLY FUNDED

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:50.920 region:rollup2
SO THE NUMBERS YOU HEARD FROM

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.887 region:rollup2
FINANCE ARE THE NUMBERS WE THINK

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.356 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:31.814 region:rollup2
HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE

01:17:30.513 --> 01:17:33.215 region:rollup2
MARKET A TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:34.850 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SEEK YOUR P. ANNUAL

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:36.185 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION. WOULD PROVIDE

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET AND HELP

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:39.388 region:rollup2
US CHART A LONG TERM COURSE FOR

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.523 region:rollup2
C. B. R. P..

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:42.158 region:rollup2
WE EXPECT THIS FUNDING WOULD

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:43.859 region:rollup2
MEET CONSUMER DEMAND FOR IN THE

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:45.427 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN FUNDING CYCLE SO

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:47.229 region:rollup2
WE WOULDN'T ENVISION ANY MAJOR

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:49.064 region:rollup2
CHANGES OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AS

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:50.499 region:rollup2
THE MARKET GROWS WILL NEED TO

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:52.434 region:rollup2
CONTINUE REFINING THE CVR P.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:53.802 region:rollup2
TARGET. AT TO TARGET THE TWO

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.303 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION TO THE CONSUMERS

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:56.305 region:rollup2
MOST INFLUENCED BY THESE

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:58.607 region:rollup2
REBATES.

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.642 region:rollup2
AND THAT COULD. BE CHANGES TO

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.976 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENTSTHAT MIGHT

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:03.145 region:rollup2
INCLUDE.

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.712 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SUCH AS

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:05.848 region:rollup2
MSRP CAPS OR OTHER TYPES OF

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:07.616 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:08.217 region:rollup2
I LIMITS TO THE PROGRAM TO STAY

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.818 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT TO HONOR BILLION

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:11.353 region:rollup2
DOLLAR BUDGET AND OF COURSE WE

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:13.422 region:rollup2
WOULD DO ANY OF THAT THROUGH OUT

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:15.758 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC PROCESS LIKE WE DO FOR

01:18:13.422 --> 01:18:16.992 region:rollup2
OUR EXISTING PROGRAM.

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:18.460 region:rollup2
I FOCUS ON THE VEHICLE INCENTIVE

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:20.029 region:rollup2
SIDE BUT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.197 region:rollup2
ONLY FULLY EFFECTIVE IF THEY'RE

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.164 region:rollup2
DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:23.599 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS YOU

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.867 region:rollup2
JUST HEARD ABOUT.

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:26.135 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.937 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY COMMISSION P. YOU SEE

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:29.838 region:rollup2
AND GO BEARS TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:31.340 region:rollup2
STATE'S SEVEN VESTMENTS STRATEGY

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:32.641 region:rollup2
AS WELL COORDINATED.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.809 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN ADDITION.

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.877 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:36.478 region:rollup2
LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.080 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO SUPPORT

01:18:36.478 --> 01:18:39.815 region:rollup2
THIS APP INITIATIVE. WE FUND

MISSION TECHNOLOGIES TO THOSE

01:18:42.351 --> 01:18:46.422 region:rollup2
SECTORS. AND WE INVEST IN EQUITY

ONE OF THE FOUR THOUSAND.

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:17.553 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A A HYDROGEN

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:20.422 region:rollup2
FUEL CELL VEHICLE.

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:21.123 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO JUST OUT A

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.591 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF.

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:25.394 region:rollup2
CONSUMER COMMENTS.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:27.896 region:rollup2
A ABOUT THE FUELING STATIONS

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:28.097 region:rollup2
WHICH I I HAVE TO SAY A ON THE

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:30.666 region:rollup2
WHOLE.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:32.134 region:rollup2
.

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:34.036 region:rollup2
NOT MANY I FOUND TO BE.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:36.905 region:rollup2
LACKING IN AND.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:38.540 region:rollup2
A A NUMBER OF ASPECTS.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:40.576 region:rollup2
OF A FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:43.312 region:rollup2
STATIONS HAVE EXTREMELY POOR

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:44.046 region:rollup2
LIGHTING. OF WHERE THE HYDROGEN

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:47.216 region:rollup2
FUEL.

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:49.218 region:rollup2
SELF A PUMP IS LOCATED A AND

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:52.221 region:rollup2
THE LEADING TO A LESS THAN

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:53.956 region:rollup2
INVITING CA A AND ENVIRONMENT.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:55.724 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:58.427 region:rollup2
THE DESIGN ISSUES THAT I'VE

01:19:55.724 --> 01:20:00.162 region:rollup2
NOTICED WHICH A. A MAKES THEM.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:02.164 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT ACCESS

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:03.732 region:rollup2
BUT THE THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:05.067 region:rollup2
THAT I.

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:06.268 region:rollup2
SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT

01:20:05.067 --> 01:20:09.171 region:rollup2
THERE'S

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:11.440 region:rollup2
NO SIGNAGE NO STREET SIGNAGE

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:15.244 region:rollup2
INDICATING THE HYDROGEN FUEL

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:17.780 region:rollup2
CELL. A. HYDROGEN OF FUEL IS

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:19.081 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE NOW.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.349 region:rollup2
AS DRIVERS WE KNOW WHERE THE

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.583 region:rollup2
STATIONS ARE BECAUSE THERE'S AN

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:23.285 region:rollup2
APP THAT THAT THAT YOU CAN

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:26.455 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:28.457 region:rollup2
BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT OF THE

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:30.125 region:rollup2
LACK OF SIGNAGE BUTTON THIS IS A

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:31.994 region:rollup2
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM THE

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:34.730 region:rollup2
GENERAL PUBLIC THAT THIS IS THE

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:36.498 region:rollup2
FUEL. THAT IS BECOMING MORE

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:37.1000 region:rollup2
UBIQUITOUS AND AVAILABLE.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.268 region:rollup2
AND IF WE'RE GONNA.

01:20:37.1000 --> 01:20:41.737 region:rollup2
TRULY BE SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:42.337 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM FORWARD AND A

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:47.543 region:rollup2
INVEST VERY SUBSTANTIAL. UP WE

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:51.814 region:rollup2
SHOULD

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:54.450 region:rollup2
BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF FULLER.

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:58.320 region:rollup2
UP OVERALL HOW WE DESIGNED AND.

01:20:54.450 --> 01:21:00.222 region:rollup2
A INDICATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.789 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATIONS EVEN EXIST.

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:01.390 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:02.358 region:rollup2
CHAIRED THE UNIVERSE OF UP

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.092 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.360 region:rollup2
VERY SMALL AND WE WORK VERY

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:05.427 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH EACH OF THEM SO

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.296 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE COMMENTS

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:10.833 region:rollup2
BACK AND SHARE THEM WITH.

01:21:07.296 --> 01:21:11.433 region:rollup2
THOSE FOLKS AND I BUT I THINK

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.902 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY GOOD SUGGESTIONS

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:15.137 region:rollup2
I'D BE HAPPY TO BE MORE SPECIFIC

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.804 region:rollup2
WITH YOU IN A PRIVATE MEETING

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:18.307 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN'T LIKE NOT TRYING TO

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:18.507 region:rollup2
CALL ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY OUT

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:19.775 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:20.442 region:rollup2
.

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:22.311 region:rollup2
BUT THE IT THE ISSUE OF SIGNAGE.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:24.179 region:rollup2
.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:26.081 region:rollup2
A IS ACROSS THE BOARD I.

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:27.249 region:rollup2
AT AND AND I HAD NOT EVEN BEEN

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.383 region:rollup2
TO THAT MANY STATIONS.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:30.452 region:rollup2
AT AT THIS POINT WE'VE ONLY HAD

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:31.387 region:rollup2
THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT TO THREE

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.155 region:rollup2
MONTHS NOW.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:33.856 region:rollup2
BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:35.891 region:rollup2
STATION WHERE THE HAS BEEN

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:36.959 region:rollup2
SIGNAGE.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.394 region:rollup2
SO TO ME THAT I IT SEEMS LIKE

01:21:36.959 --> 01:21:39.928 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.663 region:rollup2
THERE MUST BE A REASON FOR THAT

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.231 region:rollup2
AND WE OUGHT TO BE.

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:44.533 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT HOW TO OVERCOME

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:46.735 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:48.670 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:50.272 region:rollup2
MR MON.

01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:52.941 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE EXPERIENCES BEEN GREAT

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:54.042 region:rollup2
BY THE WAY UP.

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.676 region:rollup2
I HAVE A QUICK VIEW THAT JUST A

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.043 region:rollup2
FEW QUESTIONS.

01:21:54.676 --> 01:21:57.112 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:59.148 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHERE THESE

01:21:57.112 --> 01:22:01.717 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS CHO HAU

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.317 region:rollup2
MCCARTY YEARS BEING USE.

01:22:01.717 --> 01:22:03.585 region:rollup2
WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE SPECIFIC

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:06.488 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:08.624 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE?

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:09.591 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THEY.

01:22:08.624 --> 01:22:10.626 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE IT THERE'S A

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:12.594 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN THERE'S A

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:13.128 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY SO

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.962 region:rollup2
WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:15.364 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:17.266 region:rollup2
THEY PUT OUT FUNDING AND THEN

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:18.700 region:rollup2
THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.803 region:rollup2
THEY THEN SHE PARTNERS LIKE

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.703 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT LOCATION.

01:22:20.803 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THAT PUSH AND PULL AND

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:23.472 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH WITH THE STATE

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.573 region:rollup2
AGENCY THROUGH THE PUBLIC

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:26.175 region:rollup2
PROCESS KIND OF WHERE THE MONEY

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:27.209 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO GO. THE PUBLIC

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:30.145 region:rollup2
UTILITIES COMMISSION YOU KNOW

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:31.947 region:rollup2
THAT I'M WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:32.948 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND THE UTILITIES IN

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:34.249 region:rollup2
TURN WERE CLOSE WITH THE

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.384 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE WHERE

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.618 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO PUT THAT CHARGING

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.653 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL SO. ALL

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:40.923 region:rollup2
OF US ARE TALKING IN

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:42.391 region:rollup2
COORDINATION ABOUT FILLING GAPS

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:44.459 region:rollup2
THAT BEAR BE IS OVERSEEING THE

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.727 region:rollup2
VW SETTLEMENT INVESTMENTS AND SO

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:49.097 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:51.066 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFY AMERICA. TO HELP BOTH

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:53.368 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY SITES FACILITY THE

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:55.971 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF THEM BUT ALSO.

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:56.538 region:rollup2
FIND LOCATIONS THAT WORK SO

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.472 region:rollup2
THERE'S IT'S

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.575 region:rollup2
IT'S A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF PEOPLE

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:00.175 region:rollup2
WHO ARE TALKING AND RELIEF

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:01.176 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE BEST

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.844 region:rollup2
SITES FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS AND

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:02.744 region:rollup2
ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS.

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:04.480 region:rollup2
I I WOULD JUST ADD TWO POINTS

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:06.215 region:rollup2
ONE OF SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.916 region:rollup2
REALLY EMBRACED THIS CHANGE AND

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:09.985 region:rollup2
HAVE THEMSELVES INVESTED FUNDS

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:11.920 region:rollup2
ARE RECEIVED PUBLIC FUNDS.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.654 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM DO SO TO PLAN WERE

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.756 region:rollup2
GONNA PUT THIS.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:15.891 region:rollup2
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:17.960 region:rollup2
SECOND THE TOOL I DESCRIBED

01:23:15.891 --> 01:23:19.494 region:rollup2
EARLIER THIS EVEY I PRO TOOL

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.929 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES PLACES IT'S IT'S NOT

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.331 region:rollup2
A MAGIC PILL BUT IDENTIFIES

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:24.199 region:rollup2
PLACES WHERE THE BEST

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:25.534 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. SUITS THE

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.935 region:rollup2
LOCATION SO YOU HAVE THESE DC

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:29.304 region:rollup2
FAST CHARGER IS THAT WILL GIVE

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:31.740 region:rollup2
YOU A. EIGHTY PERCENT CHARGE IN

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:32.808 region:rollup2
TWENTY MINUTES OR SO IT BUT A

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.709 region:rollup2
LOT MORE EXPENSIVE SUITE ONE PUT

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:35.077 region:rollup2
THOSE IN A LOT OF PLACES WHERE

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.011 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE AT WORK IN

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:36.778 region:rollup2
THEIR CAR CAN SITTHERE FOR

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.913 region:rollup2
EIGHT HOURS AND IT DOESN'T

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:40.582 region:rollup2
MATTER THAT THEY HAVE A VERY

01:23:37.913 --> 01:23:42.317 region:rollup2
FAST CHARGER. PUTTING CORRIDORS

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:44.586 region:rollup2
SALE WAY TO VEGAS ARE PLACES

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.888 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO GO LONGER

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.823 region:rollup2
DISTANCES THAT I WANT TO SIT FOR

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:49.758 region:rollup2
THREE HOURS TO GET ENOUGH CHARGE

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:51.426 region:rollup2
TO GET TO THE HOTEL OR WHEREVER

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.995 region:rollup2
THEIR DESTINATION IS SO. WE'VE

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:56.865 region:rollup2
OR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS VERY

01:23:52.995 --> 01:23:57.432 region:rollup2
DYNAMICALLY AND WERE LEARN AN

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.667 region:rollup2
AWFUL LOT AS WE GO FORWARD.

I. APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS

01:23:58.667 --> 01:24:00.669 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE IF THE

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.870 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ARE GOING SAY FOR

01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:03.739 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE INTO. IN THE BAY AREA

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:04.373 region:rollup2
AND TO SAN DIEGO AND YOU'RE

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:04.673 region:rollup2
LEAVING THEIR THE MIDDLE PART OF

INVESTING AND CHARGING

01:24:06.408 --> 01:24:07.843 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK YOU'RE

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:08.911 region:rollup2
GONNA SEE IT. A

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:11.179 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE.

YOU KNOW.

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:15.617 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS NON USAGE OF THE

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:17.519 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IF PEOPLE CAN GET TO

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:19.187 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. UP IN

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:21.356 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE THE REBATES OUT

01:24:19.187 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE CURRENT REBATE NOW

01:24:21.356 --> 01:24:23.525 region:rollup2
AND WHAT DO YOU.

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:26.094 region:rollup2
DEBATED IT

01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:27.262 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE TO REACH

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.763 region:rollup2
EVER EVER EVER.

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT GOAL OF FIVE

FIVE.

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:03.899 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF

01:25:00.329 --> 01:25:04.466 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:05.467 region:rollup2
WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD THAT

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:07.669 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE MARKET. THAT IN

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:09.071 region:rollup2
COMBINATION WITH REQUIREMENTS ON

01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:10.839 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS TO ENSURE THAT

01:25:09.071 --> 01:25:12.240 region:rollup2
THOSE VEHICLES ARE BEING MADE.

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:14.176 region:rollup2
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.409 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:16.678 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

SO THAT THERE'S KIND OF GENERAL.

01:25:16.678 --> 01:25:20.015 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AT DOING FOR

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:22.050 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO REFUEL. A IN

01:25:20.015 --> 01:25:22.918 region:rollup2
ADDITION THIS ISN'T THE ONLY

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.686 region:rollup2
PIECE OF.

01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:26.254 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:27.689 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY OUT IN THE MARKET

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:30.525 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:31.360 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT IT AND SO THERE'S A

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:33.362 region:rollup2
LOT OF EFFORTS. TO INCREASE

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.397 region:rollup2
CONSUMER AWARENESS AND EDUCATION

01:25:33.362 --> 01:25:36.565 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING

01:25:35.397 --> 01:25:37.866 region:rollup2
EVENTS SUCH AS WRITING DRIVES

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:39.101 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU CAN JUST GET PEOPLE IN

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:40.669 region:rollup2
THE VEHICLES. LET THEM

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:42.804 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THEM I GIVE THEM

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:44.039 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THEM THE TYPES

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:46.608 region:rollup2
OF VEHICLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

01:25:44.039 --> 01:25:47.909 region:rollup2
SHOW THEM THAT THOSE VEHICLES

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:48.910 region:rollup2
CAN MEET THEIR NEEDS AND THAT

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:50.412 region:rollup2
THEY'RE FUN TO DRIVE.

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:51.980 region:rollup2
DONE A IN TERMS OF THE PLAN WHAT

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:53.849 region:rollup2
DO YOU DO ANTICIPATED AN

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:57.085 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE IN THE.

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:57.819 region:rollup2
THE REBATE AT THE SUBSIDY.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:59.087 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE DON'T EXPECT ANY

01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:01.023 region:rollup2
CHANGES SINCE

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:01.957 region:rollup2
SO YOU EXPECTED THE STATE.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:03.091 region:rollup2
BUT THE TWENTY FIVE FIVE

01:26:01.957 --> 01:26:04.593 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED NINE

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:06.428 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS LEVEL.

01:26:04.593 --> 01:26:06.728 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT FOR THAT FOR THE

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:08.330 region:rollup2
NEAR TERM.

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:09.631 region:rollup2
IN THE LONG TERM WILL HAVE TO

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.899 region:rollup2
EVALUATE WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:11.833 region:rollup2
BE CHANGES.

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:14.169 region:rollup2
BUT IT THIS TIME THAT'S WHAT WE

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:15.570 region:rollup2
EXPECT.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:17.372 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENCE THE CHAIR UP A

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:19.408 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:20.776 region:rollup2
OF A ZEV.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:23.345 region:rollup2
NOT NOT OWNING ONE MYSELF.

01:26:20.776 --> 01:26:24.346 region:rollup2
.

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:26.014 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:27.449 region:rollup2
PRICES BUT IT YOU KNOW CAN GIVE

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:29.718 region:rollup2
YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I AM

01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:30.585 region:rollup2
THE THE THE LEAF WHICH IS KIND

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:32.587 region:rollup2
OF A WELL KNOWN.

01:26:30.585 --> 01:26:33.121 region:rollup2
AS THEIR MISSION VEHICLE IS IN

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.322 region:rollup2
THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.824 region:rollup2
RANGE.

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:37.459 region:rollup2
COURSE YOU KNOW OPTIONS

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:38.593 region:rollup2
DEPENDING CAN BE MORE OR LESS%

01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:40.529 region:rollup2
THAN THAT.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:43.031 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT SO A FAIRLY TYPICAL

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:44.633 region:rollup2
ONE THEIR LEASE PRICES.

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.934 region:rollup2
THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE MUCH LESS

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:47.536 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE UNDER TWO HUNDRED

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.837 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEN OF

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.971 region:rollup2
COURSE IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:52.140 region:rollup2
CONSUMER OR MEET THE

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:53.775 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR. I'M GETTING

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF REBATES.

01:26:53.775 --> 01:26:56.411 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:58.380 region:rollup2
THOSE LEASE RATES CAN GO DOWN

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:59.848 region:rollup2
QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY SO I JUST SO

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:01.450 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AT THAT IS

01:26:59.848 --> 01:27:03.285 region:rollup2
OUR SLIDING SCALE FOR THE REBATE

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:04.319 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF. FOR LOW INCOME TO

01:27:03.285 --> 01:27:05.987 region:rollup2
BADLY RIGHT GAFFER LOW INCOME

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:07.589 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THAT THERE'S SOME

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:10.225 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD QUESTIONS THAT WOULD

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:12.694 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE SATISFIED BUT THERE

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:15.864 region:rollup2
IS A HIGHER REBATE THAT SO TEN

01:27:12.694 --> 01:27:16.765 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THAT BE BABY I THINK.

01:27:15.864 --> 01:27:17.365 region:rollup2
.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:19.000 region:rollup2
TO US ARE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:19.735 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.036 region:rollup2
IT WAS A LEAD FOR AT FIVE

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:23.171 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVEN

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:25.474 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:26.942 region:rollup2
TODAY ADDRESS A INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:25.474 --> 01:27:27.809 region:rollup2
GAPPING TO IT OBJECTIVE WITH

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:28.977 region:rollup2
JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF I

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:29.978 region:rollup2
THINK BY THIS PROPOSAL'S ACTIVE

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:31.580 region:rollup2
DRIVE MONEY AND FILL THE GAPS

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:32.714 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MENTIONING SO WHERE. WE

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.049 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE HAPPEN IS IS THE DEEP

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:35.684 region:rollup2
PENETRATION IN THE COURT MARKETS

01:27:34.049 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
AND NOT HAVE IT SPREAD OUT

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:37.619 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE REST THE STATE'S

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:39.488 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY HAD A FUNDAMENTAL

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:40.989 region:rollup2
TODAY WITH. THE WAY OF THINKING

01:27:39.488 --> 01:27:42.524 region:rollup2
OR DOING THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:44.659 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT BUT ALSO. WITH

01:27:42.524 --> 01:27:45.727 region:rollup2
BUILDING SANDERS TO RAISING THE

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:47.195 region:rollup2
MINIMUM BUILDING CENTER

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:49.431 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD FOR NEW BUILDINGS HAVE

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:51.133 region:rollup2
EVEY CABLES LOW SHERIDAN'S BUILT

01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:54.035 region:rollup2
INTO THAT SURE WE OBVIOUSLY WANT

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:55.804 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO DRIVE TO BAKERSFIELD

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:58.006 region:rollup2
SO EXACTLY NEEDED TO.

01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:59.274 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS.

01:27:58.006 --> 01:28:00.876 region:rollup2
THINK WE SURE THANK YOU ALL FOR

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:03.044 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTATION.

01:28:00.876 --> 01:28:04.880 region:rollup2
I THINK THE WORD THAT WAS USED

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:06.982 region:rollup2
WAS ECOSYSTEM LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.517 region:rollup2
PARTIES INVOLVED HERE. AND LA

01:28:06.982 --> 01:28:10.485 region:rollup2
ARISTA CONCERNED JUST ABOUT THE

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:11.787 region:rollup2
OVERALL COORDINATION HERE SO IS

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.888 region:rollup2
IS THE MONEY THE TWO THIRTY FIVE

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:14.723 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS A.

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:15.824 region:rollup2
STANGEL INVESTMENT OVER TIME IS

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:16.825 region:rollup2
A TO THIRTY FIVE GOING TO THE

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:18.360 region:rollup2
ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE ENERGY

01:28:16.825 --> 01:28:19.594 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WILL BE.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.896 region:rollup2
SORT OF AT THE CENTER OF THIS

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
HUB IF YOU WILL.

01:28:20.896 --> 01:28:25.167 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF COORDINATION JUST

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:26.802 region:rollup2
THAT AFFIRMATION THAT THAT

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:28.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACCURATE AND THEN IN

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:29.538 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:31.339 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY MEET

01:28:29.538 --> 01:28:32.641 region:rollup2
THESE METRICS UP OVER TIME I

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.775 region:rollup2
MEAN I FULLY SUPPORT WE NEED BE

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.976 region:rollup2
BUILDING OUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:36.178 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUESTION IS.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.679 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:39.214 region:rollup2
THAT TO THIRTY FIVE AND AND ARE

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:40.782 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY. MEETING OUR

01:28:39.214 --> 01:28:42.417 region:rollup2
BENCHMARK SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:44.352 region:rollup2

AND THE AND THE.

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.288 region:rollup2
AND THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:48.824 region:rollup2
SUCCESS HERE BUILDING OUT THIS

01:28:46.288 --> 01:28:49.758 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.759 region:rollup2
AND SO MAYBE IF THIS ON THE

01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:52.093 region:rollup2
COORDINATION LIKE WE'RE ALL WE

01:28:50.759 --> 01:28:53.395 region:rollup2
HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS AT THE

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:54.996 region:rollup2
PRINCIPAL LEVEL AND AT THE STAFF

01:28:53.395 --> 01:28:56.398 region:rollup2
LEVEL. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.799 region:rollup2
THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:28:56.398 --> 01:28:58.333 region:rollup2
ICTATES IS HAVING UPDATING

01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:00.101 region:rollup2
THERE'S YOUR MACHINE LEGAL

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:02.270 region:rollup2
ACTION PLAN. AND SO THERE'S A

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.604 region:rollup2
LOT OF IT ACTIONS AT ALL THE

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:03.939 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TAKE

01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:05.173 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THIS MARKET HAPPENED I

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:06.775 region:rollup2
THINK IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:08.043 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE REALLY THE. HUB OF

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:09.377 region:rollup2
THIS OVER TALKING AT THAT UNIT

01:29:08.043 --> 01:29:10.178 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE IN THE CONTINUING

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:11.680 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION IS THAT THE ENERGY

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.948 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.883 region:rollup2
AND YOU MAY BEGIN TALK ABOUT

01:29:12.948 --> 01:29:16.851 region:rollup2
YOUR PROCESS OF.

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:18.153 region:rollup2
ANNUAL UPDATES AND.

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:19.387 region:rollup2
DISCUSS YOUR WE WE DO WHAT WE DO

01:29:18.153 --> 01:29:21.056 region:rollup2
REGULAR ANNUAL UPDATES WITH ALL

01:29:19.387 --> 01:29:23.124 region:rollup2
THESE STATISTICS TO GIVE YOU A

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:24.860 region:rollup2
LITTLE SENSE OF COSTS WHICH WILL

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:26.194 region:rollup2
TRANSLATE INTO WHAT YOU GET FOR

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:27.696 region:rollup2
AN INVESTMENT OF TURNER THIRTY

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.764 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVEN'T

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:32.267 region:rollup2
FINALIZED EXACTLY HOW WE THINK

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:33.768 region:rollup2
IT'S BEST PARSED OUT IT DEPENDS

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:35.537 region:rollup2
IN PART ON READINESS OF SAY THE

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:36.738 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN FOLKS AND AND A LOT OF

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:38.139 region:rollup2
FACTUAL OR LOOKING AT THAT VERY

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:40.308 region:rollup2
CLOSELY RIGHT NOW. BUT TO GIVE

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:41.643 region:rollup2
YOU SOME SENSE PRICES VERY AND

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:43.011 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS JUST LIKE THE

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:45.380 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THEMSELVES THE COSTS

01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:47.449 region:rollup2
ARE GOING DOWN BUT TODAY A ROUGH

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:49.050 region:rollup2
COST OF A WHAT WE CALL A LEVEL

01:29:47.449 --> 01:29:50.051 region:rollup2
TWO CHARGER WHICH IS LIKE TO

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.953 region:rollup2
TWENTY WHAT RUNS YOUR DRYER AT

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:54.122 region:rollup2
HOME. IS ABOUT IN THE FIVE TO

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:55.023 region:rollup2
SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE.

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:56.458 region:rollup2
.

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:57.959 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL TWO CHARTERS THAT

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:59.694 region:rollup2
DELIVER MUCH MORE POWER MUCH

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:01.930 region:rollup2
MORE QUICKLY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:03.498 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS SO AGAIN OUR

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:05.433 region:rollup2
OUR PROPOSAL IS TO BALANCE THE

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:06.968 region:rollup2
BULK OF THE CHARGERS BEING LEVEL

01:30:05.433 --> 01:30:09.170 region:rollup2
TWO. BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER.

01:30:06.968 --> 01:30:09.671 region:rollup2
BUT MAKING SURE WE CITE SOME OF

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:12.574 region:rollup2
THESE.

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:13.642 region:rollup2
THESE TO FAST CHARGERS ABOUT

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.442 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND OF MISS THE GOAL

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:16.578 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:17.812 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IN THE PLACES WHERE IT

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:19.214 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO SO BUT

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:20.949 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL EACH YEAR TRUE THESE

01:30:19.214 --> 01:30:22.751 region:rollup2
UP AND BE ABLE TO REFLECT WHAT.

01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:25.186 region:rollup2
WHAT THE IN INVESTMENT BOUGHT A

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:27.289 region:rollup2
HOUSE AND A WHAT THE TARGET

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:29.224 region:rollup2
STILL LOOK LIKE?

01:30:27.289 --> 01:30:31.359 region:rollup2
IN THIS MAYBE FATE THE EVF PRO

01:30:29.224 --> 01:30:32.193 region:rollup2
THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.328 region:rollup2
GIVES US IN ONE OF THE. NEWEST

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:35.630 region:rollup2
AND MOST EXCITING TOOL SEXY

01:30:33.328 --> 01:30:36.798 region:rollup2
TRACK PROGRESS SO YOU CAN LOOK

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:38.133 region:rollup2
AT THE WHERE THE VESSELS ARE

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:39.267 region:rollup2
GOING HOW THE MARKET'S BEEN

01:30:38.133 --> 01:30:40.769 region:rollup2
RESPONDING HAS LOTS OF VARIABLES

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:42.637 region:rollup2
THAT CAN THROW AT IT ACTUALLY.

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:43.338 region:rollup2
REFINED AS WE GO THROUGH TIME

01:30:42.637 --> 01:30:44.539 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S ON THE PLUGIN

01:30:43.338 --> 01:30:45.974 region:rollup2
CHARGING SIDE AND ON THE

01:30:44.539 --> 01:30:48.910 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN SIDE THERE'S THAT A

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:50.512 region:rollup2
RESOURCES BOARD HAS IT THAT

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.446 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF. PARTNER MODELS THAT.

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:52.447 region:rollup2
CULTURE IN CHAT CALIFORNIA

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:53.949 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.582 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:55.817 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TOOL IT'S KIND OF FUN

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:57.419 region:rollup2
PLAY.

01:30:55.817 --> 01:30:58.653 region:rollup2
BUT SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER

01:30:57.419 --> 01:31:00.588 region:rollup2
VERY WELL CHEATING CHATTING. BUT

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:01.389 region:rollup2
THAT I'M.

01:31:00.588 --> 01:31:03.191 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA OF THEIR TWO IS

01:31:01.389 --> 01:31:04.359 region:rollup2
ALSO THE IT'S IT'S ALL BASED ON

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:05.593 region:rollup2
TRAVEL LIKE WHERE WHERE PEOPLE

01:31:04.359 --> 01:31:07.495 region:rollup2
GOING TO HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:08.096 region:rollup2
TO THESE INVESTMENTS AND SO. WE

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:11.066 region:rollup2
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:31:08.096 --> 01:31:12.434 region:rollup2
BEING STRATEGIC AND INTER INTER

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:14.803 region:rollup2
OF ABOUT THE PROCESS OF

01:31:12.434 --> 01:31:15.770 region:rollup2
PREPARING A LOT AS WE GO ALONG.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.037 region:rollup2
I'VE IT'S POINTING OUT THAT

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.906 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:19.007 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISM THIS PROGRAM IT'S

01:31:17.906 --> 01:31:20.275 region:rollup2
NOT LIKE THE URGE COMMISIONS

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:21.409 region:rollup2
GONNA PUT OUT ONE SOLICITATION

01:31:20.275 --> 01:31:22.911 region:rollup2
FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

01:31:21.409 --> 01:31:24.245 region:rollup2
MILLION. THE EXISTING PROGRAM

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:25.213 region:rollup2
PUTS OUT MULTIPLES WITH HAITIANS

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:26.581 region:rollup2
THERE'S A WHOLE STAKEHOLDER

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:27.749 region:rollup2
PROCESS BETWEEN THE TIME THEY

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:29.484 region:rollup2
RELEASE THEIR DRAFT PLAN AND

01:31:27.749 --> 01:31:30.952 region:rollup2
FINALIZE PLAN. WHICH ALLOWS THE

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:32.988 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOLICITATIONS TO BE

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:34.856 region:rollup2
TARGETED TO SPECIFIC.

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:36.391 region:rollup2
ISSUES OR AREAS THAT NEED TO BE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:38.493 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED AND SO I'M WE ARE

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:40.395 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE GAPS ALSO THAT

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:40.628 region:rollup2
WHICH. ALSO INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER

01:31:40.395 --> 01:31:41.563 region:rollup2
INPUT.

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:43.131 region:rollup2
SURE

01:31:41.563 --> 01:31:44.366 region:rollup2
EVELYN.

01:31:43.131 --> 01:31:47.068 region:rollup2
JUST ONE QUESTION THAT POPPED IN

01:31:44.366 --> 01:31:49.037 region:rollup2
MY HEAD I'M. IN TERMS OF IF WE

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:50.405 region:rollup2
IF WE DO COME CLOSER AS WEEK

01:31:49.037 --> 01:31:51.840 region:rollup2
PROGRESSED TO.

01:31:50.405 --> 01:31:54.609 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY REACHING THIS GOAL

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:55.744 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE IMPACT A AT THAT

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:57.679 region:rollup2
FROM THAT PART FINANCE IN TERMS

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:59.014 region:rollup2
OF THAT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:01.750 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT OF COURSE. HE'S

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:03.451 region:rollup2
VEHICLES DON'T PAY A GAS TAX SO

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:07.822 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE IMPACT THE TO IN

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:09.891 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THAT.

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:10.091 region:rollup2
A METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:10.992 region:rollup2
YES.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.494 region:rollup2
AT THE MARGIN.

01:32:10.992 --> 01:32:13.561 region:rollup2
.

01:32:12.494 --> 01:32:15.697 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT IT.

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:16.264 region:rollup2
.

01:32:15.697 --> 01:32:18.833 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S A SUBSTITUTION A

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:20.668 region:rollup2
FACT.

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:23.138 region:rollup2
WHERE?

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:24.606 region:rollup2
PETROLEUM BASED VEHICLES ARE.

01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:26.307 region:rollup2
SHIFTED TO MORE ELECTRIC

01:32:24.606 --> 01:32:27.976 region:rollup2
VEHICLES THERE WOULD BE LE LET'S

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:31.279 region:rollup2
REVENUE THERE BUT.

01:32:27.976 --> 01:32:33.181 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN.

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:34.015 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS OVER

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:37.986 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:38.153 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATE WITH THE GAS TAX AND.

01:32:37.986 --> 01:32:39.988 region:rollup2
WE.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:40.955 region:rollup2
.

01:32:39.988 --> 01:32:43.091 region:rollup2
IT IT WOULD BE.

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:45.427 region:rollup2
ADJUST ACCORDINGLY AS THE YEARS

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:46.961 region:rollup2
GO ON I GUESS WHAT I WOULD.

01:32:45.427 --> 01:32:48.897 region:rollup2
WHEN I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT

01:32:46.961 --> 01:32:50.832 region:rollup2
EVEN. UNDER.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.433 region:rollup2
THESE TARGETS IT WOULD STILL BE

01:32:50.832 --> 01:32:53.234 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW NUMBER

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:54.502 region:rollup2
OF.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.738 region:rollup2
.

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:58.673 region:rollup2
CARS THAT WOULD STILL BE USING

01:32:56.738 --> 01:33:00.108 region:rollup2
GASOLINE TOO SO IT'S IT'S A LONG

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:02.410 region:rollup2
TERM.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:04.112 region:rollup2
MOVING THE NEEDLE DO YOU HAVE

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:05.213 region:rollup2
ANY PROJECTIONS AND IN TERMS OF.

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:07.115 region:rollup2
IT FIVE MILLION.

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:08.383 region:rollup2
ZEDS ARE ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:10.251 region:rollup2
THIRTY GMT PROTECTIONS OF WHAT

01:33:08.383 --> 01:33:11.553 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE OVER TIME BUT I

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.921 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON

01:33:11.553 --> 01:33:14.355 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:16.257 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP. I THINK I THINK THAT

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:18.326 region:rollup2
THE LARGER CONCERN IS THAT WE

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:18.526 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:21.029 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:22.497 region:rollup2
THAT WE OUT CLEARLY MORE MILES

01:33:21.029 --> 01:33:26.367 region:rollup2

OUR REPORT.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:57.598 region:rollup2
I IT SHOWS THAT THE STATE

CURRENTLY HAS A WIDE ARRAY

01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:00.535 region:rollup2
OBSERVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS

01:38:59.167 --> 01:39:01.803 region:rollup2

HOWEVER GIVEN THE MASSIVE MULTI

01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:19.687 region:rollup2
AGENCY EFFORT WE BELIEVE.

01:39:18.085 --> 01:39:21.322 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A

ACTUALLY A MORE THAN A DECADE OF

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.877 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

THE SORTS OF PROGRAMS ARE

TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY.

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.953 region:rollup2
UNTIL START WITH WITH ONE THING

01:40:57.351 --> 01:41:00.288 region:rollup2
WE KNOW FOR ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.

01:41:09.864 --> 01:41:11.766 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S IN SEXUAL IT'S AN

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:14.235 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT.

01:41:11.766 --> 01:41:15.937 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A STRONG NEED FOR

01:41:14.235 --> 01:41:17.371 region:rollup2
COMPANY POLICIES FOR THESE SORTS

01:41:15.937 --> 01:41:18.773 region:rollup2
OF VEHICLES IN THE TRANSITION

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:20.241 region:rollup2
PHASE WHICH WHERE WHERE WE FIND

01:41:18.773 --> 01:41:21.542 region:rollup2
OURSELVES IN RIGHT NOW. AND

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:22.043 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THOSE ARE TO CUP MANY

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.010 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

01:41:22.043 --> 01:41:24.879 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:26.380 region:rollup2
I HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:27.481 region:rollup2
PROCRASTINATING AND WAITING FOR

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:28.583 region:rollup2
A FOR LATER TO MEET.

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:29.717 region:rollup2
TO TO BRING UP CLOSER TO

01:41:28.583 --> 01:41:30.818 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

01:41:29.717 --> 01:41:31.852 region:rollup2
AND WE DEFTLY WOULDN'T HAVE

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:33.387 region:rollup2
SEEN THE SAME KIND OF PROGRESS

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:33.888 region:rollup2
WE SEE TODAY ABOUT THOSE

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.256 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES.

01:41:33.888 --> 01:41:37.725 region:rollup2
.

01:41:35.256 --> 01:41:39.527 region:rollup2
IN PRACTICE WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

01:41:37.725 --> 01:41:41.362 region:rollup2
LEADING CITIES IN THE U. ANY I'D

01:41:39.527 --> 01:41:41.963 region:rollup2

WORLD THE ONES THAT SUCCEED

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:46.200 region:rollup2
ACTION HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF

01:41:44.532 --> 01:41:48.035 region:rollup2
POLICIES THEY DON'T USE A ONE

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.137 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND THEY

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:51.839 region:rollup2
DO A WIDER RANGE OF THINGS I'M

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.441 region:rollup2
WORK MY COLLEAGUES AND THE SOME

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:55.409 region:rollup2
OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT EXTERNAL.

POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

01:41:56.844 --> 01:42:00.147 region:rollup2
AND HAVE FOUND AT LEAST FIVE

01:41:58.446 --> 01:42:00.548 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLICIES THAT

01:42:00.147 --> 01:42:02.917 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN USED.

01:42:00.548 --> 01:42:04.285 region:rollup2
ROUTED TO DIFFERENT AGREES

01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:05.753 region:rollup2

STATES IN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:11.726 region:rollup2
THERE'S RECURRING INCENTIVES

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:13.327 region:rollup2
LIKE ABOUT THAT HOV LANE ACCESS

01:42:11.726 --> 01:42:14.795 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IN MANY MANY OTHERS

01:42:13.327 --> 01:42:16.564 region:rollup2
AS WELL POTENTIAL FOR PARKING

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:18.132 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES OF SORTS OF RECURRING

01:42:16.564 --> 01:42:18.1000 region:rollup2
THINGS THE EXPERIENCE REGULARLY.

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:20.801 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S REGULATORY

01:42:18.1000 --> 01:42:21.469 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS SUCH AS HOW WE HAVE

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.937 region:rollup2
THAT THIS HAVE MADE IN

01:42:21.469 --> 01:42:24.939 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HEATHER INCLUDE

01:42:22.937 --> 01:42:26.340 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN A VEHICLE FUEL

ECONOMY STANDARDS OVERALL.

01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:29.076 region:rollup2
THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE

01:42:27.775 --> 01:42:29.677 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT WHICH YOU HEARD A LOT

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.345 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

01:42:29.677 --> 01:42:32.880 region:rollup2
INGREDIENT ARM AND THEN THERE'S

01:42:31.345 --> 01:42:33.948 region:rollup2
AN EDUCATION OUTREACH COMPONENT

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.281 region:rollup2
AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:42:33.948 --> 01:42:37.385 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT.

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:38.786 region:rollup2
DE IT IN A MOMENT.

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:39.920 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN MANY OF THESE

01:42:38.786 --> 01:42:41.489 region:rollup2
POLICIES OF ANY USE TO.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.923 region:rollup2
TO REALLY A STRONG SUCCESS IN

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:44.225 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S WE HEARD A LITTLE

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:45.926 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT

01:42:44.225 --> 01:42:46.494 region:rollup2
BEEN AVAILABLE IN COMPLEMENT

01:42:45.926 --> 01:42:46.827 region:rollup2
WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT

01:42:46.494 --> 01:42:47.962 region:rollup2
THAT'S

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:49.764 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL AVAILABLE.

01:42:47.962 --> 01:42:52.133 region:rollup2
THAT'S A STRONG INCENTIVE IT

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:54.168 region:rollup2
BRINGS THE IS A RESERVES ON THE

01:42:52.133 --> 01:42:55.403 region:rollup2
MARKET DOWN TO AFFORDABILITY FOR

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:57.104 region:rollup2
A HUGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE ON

01:42:55.403 --> 01:42:57.738 region:rollup2
WHERE THOSE VEHICLES WOULD

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:58.539 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE BE OUT OF THEIR PRICE

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.573 region:rollup2
RANGE.

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.941 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE SEEN VERY STRONG

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:02.109 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT AND WE

01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:03.377 region:rollup2
DID HEAR THAT THAT.

01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:03.577 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T KEPT PACE WITH THE

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.678 region:rollup2
NEED.

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:06.180 region:rollup2
SO I I.

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:08.382 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED THIS MYSELF THIS

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:09.717 region:rollup2
MORNING I AYE VOTES STUDIED ZAPS

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:11.585 region:rollup2
FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS A LITTLE BIT

01:43:09.717 --> 01:43:12.186 region:rollup2
AND EVEY ORDER FOR FOR THE LAST

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:14.388 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:15.456 region:rollup2
AND ON MY WAY HERE I FOUND THAT

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:16.757 region:rollup2
EVERY CHARGING STATION IN THE

01:43:15.456 --> 01:43:18.292 region:rollup2
PARKING STRUCTURE WAS FULL I

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:18.926 region:rollup2
PICKED THAT I GO TO THAT PARKING

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:20.728 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:21.429 region:rollup2
HAVE CHARGERS AND OF COURSE THIS

01:43:20.728 --> 01:43:22.663 region:rollup2
NEVER ENOUGH LIKE UP THERE

01:43:21.429 --> 01:43:24.231 region:rollup2
AROUND NINE AND. AND AND ALL ALL

01:43:22.663 --> 01:43:24.865 region:rollup2
BOOKED UP SO YES WE HAVE

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:25.866 region:rollup2
INSTALLED A TON MORE

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:29.303 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THERE.

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:29.937 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL FALLING BEHIND

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.337 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL NEEDS THESE VEHICLES

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:31.272 region:rollup2
ENTER THE MARKET.

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:32.940 region:rollup2
I'M BUT WE HAVE SEEN PRETTY

01:43:31.272 --> 01:43:34.575 region:rollup2
STRONG CHRISTIAN SALES CERTAINLY

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.776 region:rollup2
WORK WERE LEAVING THE COUNTRY.

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:37.111 region:rollup2
COMPARE FAVORABLY TO A LOT OF

01:43:35.776 --> 01:43:37.912 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TRIED THIS A

01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:39.947 region:rollup2
WORLDWIDE.

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:40.281 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE THIS THE

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:42.016 region:rollup2
THE.

01:43:40.281 --> 01:43:43.717 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS OF THE INCENTIVES WE

01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:44.819 region:rollup2
HAVE I MEAN WE SEE A LOT MORE

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.886 region:rollup2
MODELS AVAILABLE THAT'S A REALLY

01:43:44.819 --> 01:43:47.221 region:rollup2
BIG DEAL HER THERE'S MORE THAT

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:48.456 region:rollup2
FORTY ALREADY ON THAT'S UP IF

01:43:47.221 --> 01:43:49.490 region:rollup2
YOU GO BACK JUST LIKE BACK IN

01:43:48.456 --> 01:43:51.559 region:rollup2
TWENTY TEN THERE'S ACTUALLY ZERO

01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:52.059 region:rollup2
MODELS AVAILABLE SIXTY

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.027 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY RAPID SHIFT.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:54.662 region:rollup2
I'M IN JUST THE LAST THE LAST

01:43:53.027 --> 01:43:55.529 region:rollup2
EIGHT YEARS.

01:43:54.662 --> 01:43:56.530 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO

01:43:55.529 --> 01:43:57.798 region:rollup2
STILL SO THOSE MODELS ARE STILL

01:43:56.530 --> 01:43:59.233 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL

01:43:57.798 --> 01:44:00.468 region:rollup2
VEHICLES AND SEDANS WE DON'T

01:43:59.233 --> 01:44:01.702 region:rollup2
HAVE AVAILABLE VEHICLES AND

01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:03.337 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES. AND WE REALLY NEED

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:05.206 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT SHIFT.

01:44:03.337 --> 01:44:06.874 region:rollup2
I'M STUDIES OF DEALERSHIPS FINDS

01:44:05.206 --> 01:44:08.375 region:rollup2
THAT BIT MOST DEALERSHIPS DON'T

01:44:06.874 --> 01:44:09.877 region:rollup2
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ZEV THAT

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:10.511 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUPPOSED BE SELLING IF

01:44:09.877 --> 01:44:11.545 region:rollup2
THEY DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

01:44:10.511 --> 01:44:12.747 region:rollup2
THEM THEY KNOW THEY DON'T WANT

01:44:11.545 --> 01:44:14.615 region:rollup2
TO SELL THEM TO CONSUMERS AND

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.449 region:rollup2
SIR SECRET SHOPPER APPROACHES

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:17.518 region:rollup2
HAVE SHOWN THAT. THROUGHOUT THE

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:19.253 region:rollup2
STATE OF VERY FEW DEALERS REALLY

01:44:17.518 --> 01:44:20.387 region:rollup2
HAVE THE TOOLS AND WILLINGNESS

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.822 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO ACTUALLY SELL THESE

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:24.425 region:rollup2
VEHICLES TO PEOPLE. AND THEN

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:24.925 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE MOST SOBERING FINDING

01:44:24.425 --> 01:44:25.192 region:rollup2
OF THE LAST YEAR OF OUR

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.161 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:28.362 region:rollup2
IS THAT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:44:27.161 --> 01:44:29.530 region:rollup2
TO BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND

01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:30.765 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN PUBLIC

01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:32.867 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AMONG TALK ABOUT

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:35.002 region:rollup2
ATTITUDES BUT AWARENESS OF ZAPS

01:44:32.867 --> 01:44:36.003 region:rollup2
THE AVAILABILITY OF OF.

01:44:35.002 --> 01:44:37.538 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES HYDROGELS OF

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
VEHICLES HASN'T BUDGED NOTHING

01:44:37.538 --> 01:44:39.807 region:rollup2
MOVED AN INCH

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:40.875 region:rollup2
WE FIND THAT WHEN WE SURVEYED

01:44:39.807 --> 01:44:41.609 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS

01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:42.643 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:43.911 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THAT VERY SIMPLE STUFF

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:45.813 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:44:43.911 --> 01:44:47.948 region:rollup2
CAN YOU NAME THE ELECTRIC

01:44:45.813 --> 01:44:48.582 region:rollup2
VEHICLE WHAT'S FOR SALE TODAY.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:49.383 region:rollup2
OF THOSE NUMBERS IT DIDN'T MOVE

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:51.652 region:rollup2
AT ALL.

01:44:49.383 --> 01:44:53.387 region:rollup2
AND THAT PUTS US TO AN ENORMOUS

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:55.189 region:rollup2
AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT GAP

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:56.991 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO THE

01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:58.159 region:rollup2
DEALERSHIP FOOT FROM THE BY

01:44:56.991 --> 01:44:59.493 region:rollup2
LARGE ANDSAY I NEED TO BUY AND

01:44:58.159 --> 01:45:00.928 region:rollup2
YOU WHAT IF YOU GOT. LEGAL WHEN

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:03.230 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR A VEHICLE THAT MEETS

01:45:00.928 --> 01:45:03.731 region:rollup2
THEIR NEEDS THAT MEETS THE SIZE

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.365 region:rollup2
THE CHARACTERISTICS THE

01:45:03.731 --> 01:45:06.033 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE

01:45:04.365 --> 01:45:07.501 region:rollup2
STYLETHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:08.936 region:rollup2
AND THAT IF THEIR WARES OBSERVER

01:45:07.501 --> 01:45:10.704 region:rollup2
OPTION AT WORK THEY'RE INFORMED

01:45:08.936 --> 01:45:12.473 region:rollup2
OF THAT BY THEIR DEALER WHICH AS

01:45:10.704 --> 01:45:13.073 region:rollup2
WE HEARD THE THEY REALLY ARE.

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:13.474 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE THEY WILL CONSIDER

01:45:13.073 --> 01:45:15.609 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:17.344 region:rollup2
SO THIS AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:18.746 region:rollup2
PIECE IS AN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:20.514 region:rollup2
INGREDIENT THAT WE STILL SEEM TO

01:45:18.746 --> 01:45:22.082 region:rollup2
BE MISSING. THE NUMBERS ARE VERY

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:23.184 region:rollup2
LOW EVEN IN CALIFORNIA.

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:24.318 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE

01:45:23.184 --> 01:45:25.719 region:rollup2
THE

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:28.088 region:rollup2
I INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENGAGEMENT

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:30.191 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE YET TO.

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:31.859 region:rollup2
TO HELP THOSE NUMBERS GROW.

01:45:30.191 --> 01:45:33.127 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE IS ONE SORT OF BIG

01:45:31.859 --> 01:45:34.562 region:rollup2
ITS INGREDIENTS I WOULD SAY IT'S

01:45:33.127 --> 01:45:36.263 region:rollup2
ON THAT ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH

01:45:34.562 --> 01:45:37.865 region:rollup2
PIECE WE NEED SOME SORT OF A. A

01:45:36.263 --> 01:45:38.699 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO GET

01:45:37.865 --> 01:45:40.601 region:rollup2
THIS SORT OF INFORMATION INTO

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:42.236 region:rollup2
INTO PEOPLE'S HANDS WE FIND THAT

01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:43.103 region:rollup2
ONCE PEOPLE ROT ONE PUPIL RIDING

01:45:42.236 --> 01:45:44.438 region:rollup2
OR DRIVE YOU VIEWS THEY HAVE

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:46.373 region:rollup2
VERY POSITIVE ATTITUDES THEY

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:47.374 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE PERFORMANCE. A

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.076 region:rollup2
ZEV OWNERS SUPPORT VERY HIGH

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.743 region:rollup2
SATISFACTION IN PART BECAUSE

01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.345 region:rollup2
THEY GET TO DO THINGS LIKE NEVER

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:53.080 region:rollup2
GO TO THE GAS STATION WHICH IS

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:54.448 region:rollup2
THAT WHICH IS GREAT PRIVILEGE

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.649 region:rollup2
AND REFILL AT HOME OR AT WORK.

01:45:54.448 --> 01:45:59.887 region:rollup2
BUT THE.

01:45:55.649 --> 01:46:02.456 region:rollup2
pGETTING BEYOND THE EARLY MARKET

01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:04.859 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ON IT IS

01:46:02.456 --> 01:46:05.492 region:rollup2
THAT IS A PRETTY SOBER AND ONE

01:46:04.859 --> 01:46:06.460 region:rollup2
AND ONE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:07.728 region:rollup2
TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:08.996 region:rollup2
FROM THAT AND AND THINKING

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:10.331 region:rollup2
REALLY RETHINKING IN A DRAMATIC

01:46:08.996 --> 01:46:11.398 region:rollup2
WAY WHAT ARE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:46:10.331 --> 01:46:12.666 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE AND I THINK ASSEMBLY

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:14.201 region:rollup2
POSITIVE STEPS.

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:15.569 region:rollup2
IN THE PROPOSAL THAT THAT'S

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:17.238 region:rollup2
HERE OF GOING BIGGER REALLY

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:18.606 region:rollup2
DOING MORE CONCERTED EFFORTS

01:46:17.238 --> 01:46:19.707 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT ISSUES LIKE LIKE

01:46:18.606 --> 01:46:20.307 region:rollup2
HAD WE DECIDED HOW TO ACTUALLY

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:21.008 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF

01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:22.710 region:rollup2
IT.

01:46:21.008 --> 01:46:24.078 region:rollup2
I CAN I CAN SAY IS THAT AS THAT

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:26.180 region:rollup2
YOU'RE THAT'S IT'S STILL AN

01:46:24.078 --> 01:46:27.448 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR E. VIS AS WELL AS I'M

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:29.016 region:rollup2
SURE IT IS FOR FOR FREE FOR FUEL

01:46:27.448 --> 01:46:30.351 region:rollup2
CELL VEHICLES. I'M GETTING THE

01:46:29.016 --> 01:46:30.651 region:rollup2
DATE OUT THERE SEE PEOPLE KNOW

01:46:30.351 --> 01:46:32.319 region:rollup2
ARE THESE.

01:46:30.651 --> 01:46:33.854 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS AVAILABLE ARE

01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:35.089 region:rollup2
THEY WORKING WHAT KIND OF

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:36.624 region:rollup2
CHARGING RATE WILL EXPECT AND

01:46:35.089 --> 01:46:37.891 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH WILL I PAY THIS

01:46:36.624 --> 01:46:38.892 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY REALLY

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.860 region:rollup2
HARD FIGHT YET WE SOLD A LOT OF

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:41.762 region:rollup2
WORK TO DO.

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:42.396 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE RESEARCH UP IN

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.898 region:rollup2
FIRST RIGHT THINK WE ALL KNOW

01:46:42.396 --> 01:46:46.600 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT WERE WERE DOING A

01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:47.134 region:rollup2
LOT OF THINGS RIGHT AND REALLY

COORDINATED STRATEGY.

01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:07.421 region:rollup2
OR LACK THERE OF AT THE CURRENT

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:08.188 region:rollup2

THERE IN TERMS OF COORDINATION

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:17.264 region:rollup2
OR HAD HAD IT HAD IMPROVED. THAT

01:47:14.895 --> 01:47:17.464 region:rollup2
COORDINATION.

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:19.500 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:20.467 region:rollup2
.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.769 region:rollup2
AS AS PREVIOUS MONTH AND THE

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:23.470 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DOES OBSERVE

01:47:21.769 --> 01:47:25.940 region:rollup2
ACTION PLAN AND THAT. DOES LAY

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:29.076 region:rollup2
OUT OF IT QUICKLY A LOT OF THE.

PERHAPS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:37.685 region:rollup2
LINES THAT DIRECTLY TARGETS THE

01:47:35.949 --> 01:47:39.853 region:rollup2
THE SPENDING AND ALSO.

01:47:37.685 --> 01:47:41.655 region:rollup2
PLACES MAYBE PREPS MORE VIA.

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:43.457 region:rollup2
.

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:46.293 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF ACCOUNTABILITY ANA.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:47.194 region:rollup2
OVER ARCHING ENTITY RATHER.

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.963 region:rollup2
OTHER WE DO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A

KIND OF SHARING OF INFORMATION

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:54.401 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:54.968 region:rollup2
PREPS HELPFUL TO HAVE.

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:57.104 region:rollup2

HAPPENING IS HAPPENING AND AND

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:02.643 region:rollup2
I'M A LAST QUESTION AND AT THE

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:04.645 region:rollup2
ONE I POSE?

TERMS OF THE IMPACT TO A GAS TAX

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:14.054 region:rollup2
REVENUE. IF IF WE USE AS WE

HAVE THE. PROJECTS AT THIS TIME.

01:48:21.562 --> 01:48:24.164 region:rollup2
IN JAPAN IF THAT'S OKAY AND JUST

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:25.866 region:rollup2
MENTION THAT THERE IS A STUDY

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:27.701 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNDER WAY CURRENTLY AT UC

AYE IT LOOKS AT THE IMPACT ON

THE THAT THE GAS TAX REVENUE

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:44.418 region:rollup2
GOING OUT.

MECHANISMS FOR FUNDING THE ROAD

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:48.622 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ONCE OF ADDRESS SOME OF

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:50.024 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES YOU MENTIONED BEFORE

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:51.091 region:rollup2
LIKE REGRESSIVITY.

01:48:50.024 --> 01:48:52.493 region:rollup2
THAT THE CENTRAL FINANCIAL

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:53.460 region:rollup2
PARTISAN PROGRESS I'M HAPPY TO

01:48:52.493 --> 01:48:53.927 region:rollup2
GET YOU AN UPDATE ON IT THAT BE

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:55.629 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:56.630 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE CENTRAL FINDING IS

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:58.565 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ONE OF THE HAVE A

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.800 region:rollup2
FUNNY IS THAT SO FAR AND FOR THE

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:01.468 region:rollup2
FORESEEABLE FUTURE OF THAT THIS

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:03.137 region:rollup2
HAVE PROGRAM. THE IMPACTS ON

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:04.505 region:rollup2
REVENUE FROM THOSE VEHICLES.

01:49:03.137 --> 01:49:06.039 region:rollup2
IS MUCH SMALLER THAN WHAT WE

01:49:04.505 --> 01:49:07.574 region:rollup2
SEE FROM THE IN IMPACT FROM

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:09.243 region:rollup2
INFLATION A PREVIOUS TO TO

01:49:07.574 --> 01:49:11.412 region:rollup2
INCREASE INDEXING THAT THE GAS

01:49:09.243 --> 01:49:12.946 region:rollup2
TAX TO THAT TO TO INFLATION AND

01:49:11.412 --> 01:49:13.914 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT ON FUEL EFFICIENCY. I

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:15.482 region:rollup2
INCREASING FUEL EFFICIENCY

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:16.250 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL VEHICLES ACTUALLY MUCH

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.851 region:rollup2
BIGGER.

01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:18.685 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:20.421 region:rollup2
SO FAR.

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:21.789 region:rollup2
AND AND CONTINUES TO BE THROUGH

01:49:20.421 --> 01:49:24.124 region:rollup2
THE THE BUTTON THAT PROGRAM'S

01:49:21.789 --> 01:49:25.859 region:rollup2
SET SO THAT I CAN HOURS IF I CAN

01:49:24.124 --> 01:49:28.362 region:rollup2
OWNERS IF I WANT SQUARE FOCUS SO

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:29.363 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THAT. AS CARS

01:49:28.362 --> 01:49:34.268 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE FEW FUEL EFFICIENT

01:49:29.363 --> 01:49:35.202 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S THE HAVING A LARGE

01:49:34.268 --> 01:49:36.270 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE

01:49:35.202 --> 01:49:37.504 region:rollup2
YET MUCH LARGER BUT IN TERMS OF

01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:38.405 region:rollup2
THESE ADS RIGHT THAT'S ONLY

01:49:37.504 --> 01:49:39.406 region:rollup2
GOING TO IMPROVE LIKE. NOTE

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:40.007 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T THAT.

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:40.607 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM YET SO

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:41.408 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR THAT WOULD THAT IN

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:42.409 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM WE NEED A WAY TO

01:49:41.408 --> 01:49:44.244 region:rollup2
FUND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:45.679 region:rollup2
TAKES ALL VEHICLES INTO ACCOUNT.

01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:49.450 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THAT SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:50.784 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION THE CONCLUSION IS.

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.785 region:rollup2
S. UNDEFINED I GUESS INTO TO THE

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:53.353 region:rollup2
CITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:54.721 region:rollup2
HYPOTHESES.

01:49:53.353 --> 01:49:56.824 region:rollup2
YOU WERE GONNA ANTICIPATED

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:58.525 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS OVER AT THE FINE.

01:49:56.824 --> 01:49:59.827 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES THOSE

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:01.128 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE THAT IN THE LONG

01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:02.162 region:rollup2
TERM YOU NEED YOU NEED A WAY FOR

01:50:01.128 --> 01:50:03.597 region:rollup2
IT TO PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:05.432 region:rollup2
OKAY. SO THERE IS A REDUCTION

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:07.234 region:rollup2
AND GUESS I SEVEN YOU THERE IS A

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:08.435 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THERE DEFINITELY IS.

01:50:07.234 --> 01:50:10.270 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE ORDERS MORE

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:11.939 region:rollup2
VEHICLES ON THE MARKET AYE IT

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:13.340 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST RELATIVE TO OTHER

01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:15.075 region:rollup2
FACTORS IT HASN'T BEEN LARGE WE

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.909 region:rollup2
DON'T EXPECT TO BE. IN THAT IN

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:17.044 region:rollup2
THE LIFETIME OF WHAT WE'RE

01:50:15.909 --> 01:50:18.378 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF.

EXPERIENCE.

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:28.935 region:rollup2
SOME SOME MAJOR FACTORS IS THAT

01:53:27.034 --> 01:53:30.737 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE THERE IS A HIGH

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:32.539 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF VARIABLE COST

01:53:30.737 --> 01:53:34.875 region:rollup2
THAT WERE UNANTICIPATED THAT GO

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:36.543 region:rollup2
INTO. THE INSTALLATION OF THE

01:53:34.875 --> 01:53:36.977 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS THEMSELVES

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.512 region:rollup2
ARMS HEAVY AMOUNT OF

ENGINEERING.

01:53:38.512 --> 01:53:41.448 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:43.550 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE

01:53:41.448 --> 01:53:44.985 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ON SITE SO YOU CAN YOU

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:47.020 region:rollup2
CAN PLAN FOR THE PROJECTS YOU

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:48.055 region:rollup2
CAN PICK IDEAL LOCATIONS BUT

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:50.490 region:rollup2
REALLY UNTIL YOU START TO

01:53:48.055 --> 01:53:52.159 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE GREAT CONDITIONS

01:53:50.490 --> 01:53:53.794 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS YOU KNOW. OUR

01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:55.128 region:rollup2
HOPE ELECTRIC FEELING I'M

01:53:53.794 --> 01:53:56.630 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT WORK.

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:57.798 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF AGAIN ON

01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:59.399 region:rollup2
VARIABLE COSTS SO.

01:53:57.798 --> 01:54:01.601 region:rollup2
THAT MAJOR LESSON LEARNED FROM

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:03.103 region:rollup2
US IS TO ENGAGE.

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:04.838 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL ELECTRIC UTILITY

01:54:03.103 --> 01:54:06.940 region:rollup2
EARLY AND OFTEN I MEAN IF FROM

01:54:04.838 --> 01:54:08.542 region:rollup2
FROM THE VERY CONCEPTION PHASE

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.744 region:rollup2
OF THIS TYPE OF DEPLOYMENT YOU

01:54:08.542 --> 01:54:11.211 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:54:10.744 --> 01:54:12.879 region:rollup2
WHOEVER'S MENTION THE

01:54:11.211 --> 01:54:14.247 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION GRID. ON IT CANNOT

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:16.650 region:rollup2
BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND.

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:18.518 region:rollup2
I'M I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT.

01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:20.387 region:rollup2
WE ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED AND

WHICH IS.

01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:39.339 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT MORE POWER THAN A

01:59:42.942 --> 01:59:46.312 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOUND THAT ALSO FOUND

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ENERGY

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:55.155 region:rollup2

01:59:55.155 --> 01:59:59.192 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THESE COSTS

01:59:57.023 --> 02:00:01.995 region:rollup2
AND AND GROW THEIR ZERO EMISSION

01:59:59.192 --> 02:00:02.962 region:rollup2

02:04:56.456 --> 02:04:59.759 region:rollup2
FIVE FOR THE ZERO MISSION.

02:04:58.257 --> 02:05:02.695 region:rollup2
VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:04:59.759 --> 02:05:03.930 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT KIND OF GAPS IN

02:05:02.695 --> 02:05:05.732 region:rollup2
THAT GOING FORWARD.

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:06.499 region:rollup2
TO MEET THAT GOAL THROUGH THE

02:05:05.732 --> 02:05:08.134 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LITERATURE

02:05:06.499 --> 02:05:10.336 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION COALITION.

02:05:08.134 --> 02:05:11.971 region:rollup2
THAN WE'VE WHICH WERE A MEMBER

02:05:10.336 --> 02:05:13.339 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO LOOKING AT THERE COULD

02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:14.574 region:rollup2
BE AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT TWO

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:17.510 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLAR GAP.

02:05:14.574 --> 02:05:19.112 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE FULL REQUIREMENTS.

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:20.480 region:rollup2
OF.

02:05:19.112 --> 02:05:22.315 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MEET THAT FIVE MILLION

02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:24.851 region:rollup2
GOAL OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY.

02:05:22.315 --> 02:05:27.153 region:rollup2
LESSONS LEARNED SUCCESS STORIES

02:05:24.851 --> 02:05:28.955 region:rollup2
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE UMBERLEIGH

02:05:27.153 --> 02:05:30.623 region:rollup2
THE BEEN TWO MAJOR ONES THAT WE

02:05:28.955 --> 02:05:32.392 region:rollup2
REALLY ENCOUNTERED FIRST IS

02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:35.161 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING.

02:05:32.392 --> 02:05:37.330 region:rollup2
AND SECOND IS PROBABLY INTEREST

02:05:35.161 --> 02:05:38.131 region:rollup2
TO PROPERTY OWNERS ACTUALLY HOST

02:05:37.330 --> 02:05:40.433 region:rollup2
INSIGHT.

02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:42.335 region:rollup2
AT STATION.

02:05:40.433 --> 02:05:42.702 region:rollup2
WE STARTED THE POINT OR DC

02:05:42.335 --> 02:05:44.771 region:rollup2
THATCHER GREEN.

02:05:42.702 --> 02:05:46.906 region:rollup2
GOING BACK ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO

02:05:44.771 --> 02:05:48.775 region:rollup2
THE FOR PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR US

02:05:46.906 --> 02:05:51.277 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME. WAS.

02:05:48.775 --> 02:05:51.978 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE TO AN RGB GO

02:05:51.277 --> 02:05:54.447 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENT.

02:05:51.978 --> 02:05:56.182 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS IN THE INVESTOR OWNED

02:05:54.447 --> 02:05:58.017 region:rollup2
UTILITY SERVICE AREAS DID NOT

02:05:56.182 --> 02:06:00.887 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE PUBLIC ON UTILITY SO

02:05:58.017 --> 02:06:01.421 region:rollup2
WE STARTED UP OUR OWN PROGRAM TO

02:06:00.887 --> 02:06:04.323 region:rollup2
KIND OF FILL OUR OWN GAP.

02:06:01.421 --> 02:06:04.557 region:rollup2
IN THAT PROGRAM AND WE'VE

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:06.459 region:rollup2
REALLY.

02:06:04.557 --> 02:06:08.995 region:rollup2
WITH THROUGH OUR OWN FUNDING.

02:06:06.459 --> 02:06:10.430 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO TO GET OUR.

02:06:08.995 --> 02:06:12.365 region:rollup2
STATION STARTED BUT THE

02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:13.699 region:rollup2
SECONDARY THING THAT WE FOUND

02:06:12.365 --> 02:06:15.601 region:rollup2
WAS WHO WAS VERY HARD TO

02:06:13.699 --> 02:06:16.569 region:rollup2
CONVINCE PROPERTY OWNERS

02:06:15.601 --> 02:06:18.371 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHAT US.

02:06:16.569 --> 02:06:20.940 region:rollup2
BUILD A STATION ON THEIR

02:06:18.371 --> 02:06:22.108 region:rollup2
PROPERTY. ON MANY OCCASIONS MODE

02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:24.143 region:rollup2
WAS GOING TO PICK UP THE WHOLE

02:06:22.108 --> 02:06:25.144 region:rollup2
TAP PER STATION CONSTRUCTION.%

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:27.747 region:rollup2
BUT THE STATION.

02:06:25.144 --> 02:06:29.849 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BACK OUT

02:06:27.747 --> 02:06:34.454 region:rollup2
AT SOMETIME DURING THE PROCESS.

02:06:29.849 --> 02:06:36.255 region:rollup2
THAT WATER CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:06:34.454 --> 02:06:37.023 region:rollup2
STATION'S BEING PROFITABLE

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:38.091 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FOR THE SITE HOST TO

02:06:37.023 --> 02:06:39.192 region:rollup2
CONSIDER.

02:06:38.091 --> 02:06:40.726 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY RISK

02:06:39.192 --> 02:06:41.994 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT AMERICAN

02:06:40.726 --> 02:06:44.831 region:rollup2
DISABILITY ACT EXPOSURE.

02:06:41.994 --> 02:06:46.399 region:rollup2
ALSO PARKING CONSIDERATIONS AND

02:06:44.831 --> 02:06:47.967 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS.

02:06:46.399 --> 02:06:49.402 region:rollup2
BY FAR AWAY THOUGH I THINK A

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:50.636 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF AT THE PROFITABILITY

02:06:49.402 --> 02:06:52.438 region:rollup2
TO THE OPERATOR.

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:53.706 region:rollup2
ON SITE HOST WAS THE BIGGEST

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:54.841 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:56.909 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:06:54.841 --> 02:06:58.211 region:rollup2
STATIONS WE DON'T THINK ARE

02:06:56.909 --> 02:07:00.813 region:rollup2
VERY BIG PROFIT.

02:06:58.211 --> 02:07:02.315 region:rollup2
CENTERS CHARGING STATIONS THAT

02:07:00.813 --> 02:07:04.050 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL HAVE

02:07:02.315 --> 02:07:05.985 region:rollup2
USUALLY BEEN INSTALLED THAT A

02:07:04.050 --> 02:07:12.258 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT

02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:14.694 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS TO THAT BUSINESS.

02:07:12.258 --> 02:07:15.261 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE BUSINESS MODEL IS

02:07:14.694 --> 02:07:16.496 region:rollup2
TO MAKE UP FOR RETAIL SALES

02:07:15.261 --> 02:07:18.431 region:rollup2
WHEN.

02:07:16.496 --> 02:07:20.032 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COME INTO THAT STORE THE

02:07:18.431 --> 02:07:21.100 region:rollup2
AT THE PARK THEIR CAR FOR THIRTY

02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:22.368 region:rollup2
MINUTES AND GO IN AND BUY

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.503 region:rollup2
GROCERIES SERVES A CERTAIN.

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:25.338 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL TRANSACTION THAT THEY

02:07:23.503 --> 02:07:27.507 region:rollup2
COME BACK OVER.

02:07:25.338 --> 02:07:28.841 region:rollup2
ALSO IT'S VERY OBVIOUS SOME

02:07:27.507 --> 02:07:29.709 region:rollup2
AUTOMAKERS TESLA BEING THE

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:30.443 region:rollup2
POSTER CHILD HAS SUPPORTED

02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:32.178 region:rollup2
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:07:30.443 --> 02:07:34.013 region:rollup2
UP UNTIL RECENTLY IT'S ALWAYS

02:07:32.178 --> 02:07:37.183 region:rollup2
BEEN FREE FROM A FOR.

02:07:34.013 --> 02:07:37.517 region:rollup2
.

02:07:37.183 --> 02:07:38.618 region:rollup2
SECURELY THE.

02:07:37.517 --> 02:07:39.252 region:rollup2
.

02:07:38.618 --> 02:07:41.120 region:rollup2
OLDER VEHICLES.

02:07:39.252 --> 02:07:41.787 region:rollup2
ALL THAT WAS IT ESSENTIALLY TO

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.488 region:rollup2
SELL VEHICLES NOT NECESSARILY TO

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.689 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE ENERGY.

02:07:42.488 --> 02:07:45.491 region:rollup2
SO THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS

02:07:43.689 --> 02:07:47.527 region:rollup2
MODELS MAKE IT REALLY KIND OF.

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:48.928 region:rollup2
ON DISINCENTIVE FOR A LOT OF

02:07:47.527 --> 02:07:51.397 region:rollup2
FOLKS TO CITE.

02:07:48.928 --> 02:07:52.565 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE GO

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:54.267 region:rollup2
THROUGH A LOT OF CITING A

02:07:52.565 --> 02:07:55.334 region:rollup2
SUPPORT WORK.

02:07:54.267 --> 02:07:56.035 region:rollup2
A SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

02:07:55.334 --> 02:07:58.237 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE.

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:59.405 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH A LOT OF THE

02:07:58.237 --> 02:08:01.607 region:rollup2
SERVICE PROVIDERS.

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:02.642 region:rollup2
ONE THING ABOUT ELECTRIC CUT

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:04.744 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION THAT'S KINDA

02:08:02.642 --> 02:08:06.012 region:rollup2
UNIQUE IF YOU ARE NOT TIED TO A

02:08:04.744 --> 02:08:08.080 region:rollup2
CERTAIN FACILITY.

02:08:06.012 --> 02:08:09.682 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ESSENTIALLY DO IS HELP

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.750 region:rollup2
THEM E. VALUE WAIT MULTIPLE

02:08:09.682 --> 02:08:12.785 region:rollup2
SITES

02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:14.787 region:rollup2
AROUND A GIVEN LOCATION?

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:16.122 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST

02:08:14.787 --> 02:08:18.958 region:rollup2
ECONOMICAL SITE WITH REGARDS TO

02:08:16.122 --> 02:08:20.660 region:rollup2
WORD ATTACHED TO THE GRID. ON

02:08:18.958 --> 02:08:20.893 region:rollup2
THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES WHO IT

02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:23.563 region:rollup2
WHIRL.

02:08:20.893 --> 02:08:25.031 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HELP IDENTIFY.

02:08:23.563 --> 02:08:26.566 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THE METRIC WOULD

02:08:25.031 --> 02:08:28.067 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BE FOUR TO FIVE

02:08:26.566 --> 02:08:30.303 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR EVERYONE

02:08:28.067 --> 02:08:31.904 region:rollup2
THAT GETS CITED. TRYING TO FIND

02:08:30.303 --> 02:08:33.573 region:rollup2
THE BEST A PLACE ON THE GRID

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:35.041 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT WE WILL ALSO

02:08:33.573 --> 02:08:38.244 region:rollup2
DO IS.

02:08:35.041 --> 02:08:39.178 region:rollup2
HELP WITH THE COORDINATION AT

02:08:38.244 --> 02:08:41.614 region:rollup2
SMUD WE WORK WITH.

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:43.082 region:rollup2
SEVERAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL

02:08:41.614 --> 02:08:44.450 region:rollup2
TRYING TO COME IN AND PROVIDE

02:08:43.082 --> 02:08:46.085 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:08:44.450 --> 02:08:47.587 region:rollup2
WE OURSELVES IN OUR OWN

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:49.388 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM.

02:08:47.587 --> 02:08:50.623 region:rollup2
IN LISTTHEM TO FIND OUT WHERE

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:52.625 region:rollup2
THEY ARE NOT INSTALLING

02:08:50.623 --> 02:08:54.527 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WERE.

02:08:52.625 --> 02:08:56.562 region:rollup2
MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN COVER

02:08:54.527 --> 02:08:58.097 region:rollup2
RENA THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE.

02:08:56.562 --> 02:09:01.434 region:rollup2
AND BASICALLY.

02:08:58.097 --> 02:09:01.901 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE GAPS IN IN THE

02:09:01.434 --> 02:09:03.069 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

02:09:01.901 --> 02:09:06.172 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:07.373 region:rollup2
WERE SEEN ON MODERN DAY TIMES WE

02:09:06.172 --> 02:09:08.874 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE SEEN MUCH MORE COST

02:09:07.373 --> 02:09:10.243 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN NEW CONSTRUCTION

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:11.877 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:09:10.243 --> 02:09:14.080 region:rollup2
AS MUCH OF THIS INFRASTRCTURE

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:16.882 region:rollup2
IS WE CAN GET INTO A BUILDING OR

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:18.584 region:rollup2
A PARKING LOT BEFORE IT IS BILL

02:09:16.882 --> 02:09:20.586 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COME IN AND.

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:23.222 region:rollup2
INSTALL IT AFTER THE FACT ON THE

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:24.657 region:rollup2
BALLPARK EVEN METRIC WE HAVE IS

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:26.425 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF A TEN X.

02:09:24.657 --> 02:09:28.961 region:rollup2
COST REDUCTION. IF WERE ABLE TO

02:09:26.425 --> 02:09:29.262 region:rollup2
GET THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:33.065 region:rollup2
DURING THE.

02:09:29.262 --> 02:09:35.334 region:rollup2
IN NEW CONSTRUCTION OPPORTUNITY.

02:09:33.065 --> 02:09:37.203 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY ALSO PROBABLY

02:09:35.334 --> 02:09:38.371 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT WE FEEL IN THE

02:09:37.203 --> 02:09:41.073 region:rollup2
MULTI FAMILY ARENA I THINK.

02:09:38.371 --> 02:09:41.674 region:rollup2
MULTI FAMILY LEVEL TWO IS WHAT

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:42.642 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALL KINDA STARTING TO

02:09:41.674 --> 02:09:44.443 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IS PROBABLY THE

02:09:42.642 --> 02:09:46.579 region:rollup2
TOUGHEST NUT TO CRACK IN.

02:09:44.443 --> 02:09:48.481 region:rollup2
EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:09:46.579 --> 02:09:50.683 region:rollup2
SO NEW APARTMENTS GOING UP THIS

02:09:48.481 --> 02:09:52.451 region:rollup2
MUCH CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS

02:09:50.683 --> 02:09:54.620 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET SPECT INTO THOSE.

02:09:52.451 --> 02:09:56.255 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:57.289 region:rollup2
ALSO SEE THAT THAT OVERLAPS VERY

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:59.358 region:rollup2
OFTEN WITH LOW INCOME

02:09:57.289 --> 02:10:01.427 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO I'M

02:09:59.358 --> 02:10:02.495 region:rollup2
REALLY KIND WORKS ON THAT

02:10:01.427 --> 02:10:03.863 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:10:02.495 --> 02:10:04.930 region:rollup2
IN SO WE THINK THAT'S A A BIG

02:10:03.863 --> 02:10:06.766 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY WERE ACTUALLY

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:08.100 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR FUNDING

02:10:06.766 --> 02:10:10.169 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TO PRIORITIZE IT

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.004 region:rollup2
TOWARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION.

02:10:10.169 --> 02:10:13.339 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN HAN

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:16.242 region:rollup2
THE CHARGING SERVICE PROVIDER.

02:10:13.339 --> 02:10:17.810 region:rollup2
THAT'S WORKED ON I MENTION THAT

02:10:16.242 --> 02:10:19.945 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE

02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:21.013 region:rollup2
A PROPERTY OWNER TO US CITED

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:23.816 region:rollup2
STATION WHAT THEY'VE DONE

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:25.384 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY IS THEY WILL GO IN.

02:10:23.816 --> 02:10:26.886 region:rollup2
GAUGE A LARGE.

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:29.188 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP COMPANY THAT

02:10:26.886 --> 02:10:30.189 region:rollup2
HAS MULTIPLE PROPERTIES ALL OVER

02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:32.058 region:rollup2
THE STATE ARE ALL OVER THE

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:33.759 region:rollup2
NATION. THEY'LL NEGOTIATE A

02:10:32.058 --> 02:10:35.695 region:rollup2
MASTER AGREEMENT SO THEY HAVE

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:37.830 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO MULTIPLE TYPES OF

02:10:35.695 --> 02:10:40.032 region:rollup2
PROPERTY SITUATIONS THAT KEEPS

02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:42.068 region:rollup2
THEM FROM HAVING TO GO ON

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:43.636 region:rollup2

INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:10:51.677 --> 02:10:55.014 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM ARE TIED TO A

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:55.448 region:rollup2
RETAIL BUSINESSES SO THAT VERY

02:10:55.014 --> 02:10:56.982 region:rollup2
MUCH.

02:10:55.448 --> 02:10:59.985 region:rollup2
HELPS BRING IN.

LASTLY.

02:11:11.364 --> 02:11:15.601 region:rollup2
MORE ON THE TECHNICAL AND.

02:11:13.399 --> 02:11:17.436 region:rollup2

RIGHT NOW IN DC FAST CHARGING

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:19.572 region:rollup2
I'LL JUST MENTION THAT THERE'RE

02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:20.606 region:rollup2
TWO TO THREE DIFFERENT.

02:11:19.572 --> 02:11:22.508 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL CONNECTOR STANDARDS

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:23.509 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY INCREASES COST IN

02:11:22.508 --> 02:11:25.244 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

02:11:23.509 --> 02:11:26.278 region:rollup2
TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS A

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:28.481 region:rollup2
SIGHTED AT EACH LOCATION.

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:30.282 region:rollup2
WERE HOPING IN WHERE UP

02:11:28.481 --> 02:11:31.417 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN FORM SET CAN.

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:33.152 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO COMBINE THAT.

02:11:31.417 --> 02:11:33.486 region:rollup2
BASICALLY GET EVERYBODY DOWN TO

02:11:33.152 --> 02:11:35.054 region:rollup2
A CON THEN.

02:11:33.486 --> 02:11:36.822 region:rollup2
STANDARD CONNECTOR

02:11:35.054 --> 02:11:38.724 region:rollup2
CONFIGURATION SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:39.959 region:rollup2
TO HAVE I'LL JUST SAY ONE

02:11:38.724 --> 02:11:41.761 region:rollup2
DEDICATED FOR ONE TYPE OF

02:11:39.959 --> 02:11:44.497 region:rollup2
VEHICLE ONE FOR ANOTHER. AND

02:11:41.761 --> 02:11:47.099 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BASICALLY HAVE CONFUSION

02:11:44.497 --> 02:11:48.300 region:rollup2
OR I HAVE MULTIPLE UNITS THERE

02:11:47.099 --> 02:11:49.635 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:51.537 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL COSTS AT EACH SITE

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:52.538 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE ENTIRE

02:11:51.537 --> 02:11:53.873 region:rollup2
FLEET OF VEHICLES OUT THERE.

02:11:52.538 --> 02:11:55.808 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS WITH

02:11:53.873 --> 02:11:57.076 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO CUT ITS SUCCESSES AND

02:11:55.808 --> 02:11:59.278 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:11:57.076 --> 02:12:00.479 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS WE THINK

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:02.648 region:rollup2
COULD BE BETTER.

WHAT IS DONE IN THAT

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:20.085 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN WHEN YOU SEE

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.820 region:rollup2
OF A QUADRUPLING OF OF?

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:24.223 region:rollup2
?

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:25.491 region:rollup2

ABSOLUTE SO THAT YOU KNOW

02:14:29.194 --> 02:14:31.330 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VARIETY DIFFERENCE

02:14:30.763 --> 02:14:31.530 region:rollup2
NUYS THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF

02:14:31.330 --> 02:14:33.032 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:14:31.530 --> 02:14:33.933 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

02:14:33.032 --> 02:14:35.134 region:rollup2
NOT AT A PHASE YET WHERE THIS

02:14:33.933 --> 02:14:37.670 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE THE SITE MEANING THAT

02:14:35.134 --> 02:14:38.304 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT

02:14:37.670 --> 02:14:39.038 region:rollup2
OPTIONS WITHIN THE SAME REASON

02:14:38.304 --> 02:14:40.306 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO. IF IT'S COST

02:14:39.038 --> 02:14:42.875 region:rollup2
PROHIBITIVE OR THERE'S GOING TO

02:14:40.306 --> 02:14:43.909 region:rollup2
BE.

02:14:42.875 --> 02:14:45.077 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL IMPACTS NEGATIVE

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.644 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THE GRADE WE ARE WE

02:14:45.077 --> 02:14:47.246 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE AN

02:14:45.644 --> 02:14:48.247 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE SITE IF THIS IS THE

02:14:47.246 --> 02:14:49.348 region:rollup2
SITE AND HAS TO BE THAN WE WOULD

02:14:48.247 --> 02:14:51.150 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WORK WITH THE UTILITY.

02:14:49.348 --> 02:14:52.685 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO UPGRADE THE POWER

02:14:51.150 --> 02:14:53.752 region:rollup2
IN THERE IS BECAUSE THERE'S COST

02:14:52.685 --> 02:14:54.486 region:rollup2
THAT'S INSTALLATION BECAUSE AS A

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:56.488 region:rollup2
VARIABLE COST THAT.

02:14:54.486 --> 02:15:00.292 region:rollup2
WE WOULD BEAR IN TOWARDS TO A

02:14:56.488 --> 02:15:02.895 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO UPGRADE.

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:04.530 region:rollup2
THE ELECTIONS CAPACITY INSIDE.

02:15:02.895 --> 02:15:07.366 region:rollup2
MR SO OVER A ON THIS IS PROBABLY

02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:08.834 region:rollup2
A A. A REALLY BIG TOPIC TO TO

02:15:07.366 --> 02:15:10.736 region:rollup2
COVER BUT IF YOU COULD JUST DE

02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:12.805 region:rollup2
PERHAPS GIVE ME A SUMMARY ARMED

02:15:10.736 --> 02:15:16.175 region:rollup2
RESPONSE. A I LEARNED YESTERDAY

02:15:12.805 --> 02:15:18.377 region:rollup2
THAT CHINA IS OPERATING A FLEET

02:15:16.175 --> 02:15:19.011 region:rollup2
OF SOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND.

02:15:18.377 --> 02:15:26.585 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC BUSES WE NEED TO LEARN

02:15:19.011 --> 02:15:29.922 region:rollup2
FROM THEM OR I

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:31.957 region:rollup2
IS IT JUST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:15:29.922 --> 02:15:33.759 region:rollup2
NOT APPLICABLE OUT WHAT THE

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:35.928 region:rollup2
FIRST POST TWENTY THOUSAND ONE

02:15:33.759 --> 02:15:38.530 region:rollup2
CITY SO I ICE IT'S EVEN GOTTEN

02:15:35.928 --> 02:15:38.964 region:rollup2
THE AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SCALE

02:15:38.530 --> 02:15:39.965 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT A MILLION.

02:15:38.964 --> 02:15:40.566 region:rollup2
AT SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:42.334 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES

02:15:40.566 --> 02:15:44.603 region:rollup2
BORDER YEAR. IN CHINA VERSUS.

02:15:42.334 --> 02:15:45.137 region:rollup2
ARE BY THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES

02:15:44.603 --> 02:15:46.672 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE UNITED STATES

02:15:45.137 --> 02:15:47.806 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THERE IS IS DONE ON

02:15:46.672 --> 02:15:48.774 region:rollup2
STEROIDS I THINK THERE IS AN

02:15:47.806 --> 02:15:49.975 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ON MY

02:15:48.774 --> 02:15:51.377 region:rollup2
SHORTS COORDINATED. AND A

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:52.845 region:rollup2
SCANNING TOUR WOULD BE REALLY

02:15:51.377 --> 02:15:54.680 region:rollup2
VALUED I THINK.

02:15:52.845 --> 02:15:56.348 region:rollup2
AND GOING THROUGH CHINA.

02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:57.683 region:rollup2
BUT I THOUGHT SO I THINK THAT

02:15:56.348 --> 02:15:59.651 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON IN

02:15:57.683 --> 02:16:01.153 region:rollup2
EUROPE AS WELL. A EUROPE IS AS

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:02.721 region:rollup2
BUYING ELECTRIC BUSES IT AT MORE

02:16:01.153 --> 02:16:06.025 region:rollup2
THAN TRIPLE THE RATE.

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:07.059 region:rollup2
THAT THE U. S.'S OKAY NOT QUITE

02:16:06.025 --> 02:16:08.994 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS ASIA PROBABLY A

02:16:07.059 --> 02:16:10.763 region:rollup2
LITTLE CLOSER. IN THE KIND OF.

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:11.930 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE QUALITY

02:16:10.763 --> 02:16:14.533 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT THE.

02:16:11.930 --> 02:16:15.100 region:rollup2
U. S. AS AND I THINK A LOT TO

02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:16.435 region:rollup2
BE LEARNED FROM SCANNING TO

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:18.804 region:rollup2
WORK.

02:16:16.435 --> 02:16:20.606 region:rollup2
OF EUROPE AS WELL EFFECT I JUST

02:16:18.804 --> 02:16:22.808 region:rollup2
NOTICED RECENTLY ON A ON A.

02:16:20.606 --> 02:16:25.611 region:rollup2
R. P. THAT.

02:16:22.808 --> 02:16:27.046 region:rollup2
LA MEJOR HAS OUT ON THE STREET

02:16:25.611 --> 02:16:29.081 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW FOR. THE LOOKING FOR

02:16:27.046 --> 02:16:30.616 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT TO PLAN THEIR

02:16:29.081 --> 02:16:33.452 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ALLEY METRO YOU

02:16:30.616 --> 02:16:33.952 region:rollup2
KNOW IS THE LARGEST TRANSIT

02:16:33.452 --> 02:16:34.920 region:rollup2
PROPERTY IN THE STATE.

02:16:33.952 --> 02:16:36.655 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED BUSES ARE

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:38.257 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE STE THREE.

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:39.324 region:rollup2
IT'S GETTING TOWARDS. OVERSEAS.

02:16:38.257 --> 02:16:40.259 region:rollup2
AND.

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:41.593 region:rollup2
AT BAY THEY WANT BUDGET INTO

02:16:40.259 --> 02:16:42.795 region:rollup2
THAT SO IT HELPED US WOULD BE

02:16:41.593 --> 02:16:43.929 region:rollup2
OUR TEA. IN THE EARLY MARKET TO

02:16:42.795 --> 02:16:45.898 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE T. CAN

02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:46.465 region:rollup2
COME FROM OVERSEAS HERE AND I

02:16:45.898 --> 02:16:47.066 region:rollup2
THINK LEARNING FROM THEM AS

02:16:46.465 --> 02:16:49.001 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:16:47.066 --> 02:16:50.669 region:rollup2
SO I WISH I COULD TELL YOU WHAT

02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:51.904 region:rollup2
THOSE LEARNINGS ARE THE BIGGEST

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:53.839 region:rollup2
CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE

02:16:51.904 --> 02:16:56.241 region:rollup2
GREAT ISSUES. LOVE TO SEE HAVE A

02:16:53.839 --> 02:16:57.276 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH GREAT RESILIENCY

02:16:56.241 --> 02:16:57.843 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:16:57.276 --> 02:16:59.845 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC.

02:16:57.843 --> 02:17:00.612 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUE HERE THESE

02:16:59.845 --> 02:17:03.148 region:rollup2
VEHICLES GOING TO CONTINUE

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:04.149 region:rollup2
OPERATING. THE GRADES DOWN OKAY

02:17:03.148 --> 02:17:05.350 region:rollup2
SO I TALK ABOUT THESE MICRO

02:17:04.149 --> 02:17:07.219 region:rollup2
BRIDGE SOLUTIONS WE TRY TO

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:08.153 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW OUR FOLKS DEAL

02:17:07.219 --> 02:17:10.155 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I THINK THERE ARE

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:10.789 region:rollup2
LEARNING TO BE HAVE I I'M NOT

02:17:10.155 --> 02:17:12.591 region:rollup2
SURE I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT

02:17:10.789 --> 02:17:14.860 region:rollup2
THEY ARE.

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:17.429 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU AND THAT A A IS A

02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:19.531 region:rollup2
AB T. EXPERIENCING. OF THE KIND

02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:20.799 region:rollup2
OF RIDERSHIP DECLINED THAT.

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:23.135 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY IT'S BEEN.

02:17:20.799 --> 02:17:23.902 region:rollup2
REPORTING IN GENERAL I I DON'T

02:17:23.135 --> 02:17:24.937 region:rollup2
THINK THEY I DON'T KNOW IF

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:27.172 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS

02:17:24.937 --> 02:17:28.507 region:rollup2
ARBUS GROWTH AREA A LOT OF

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:30.109 region:rollup2
PEOPLE COMMUTING INTO LA.

02:17:28.507 --> 02:17:31.777 region:rollup2
FOR JOBS THAT GOT TRANSPORTED

02:17:30.109 --> 02:17:32.711 region:rollup2
WANT TO SANTA CLARA MIGHT BE THE

02:17:31.777 --> 02:17:33.612 region:rollup2
OPPOSITE TRIED TO THE OPPOSITE

02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:35.214 region:rollup2
UNIT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO

02:17:33.612 --> 02:17:36.849 region:rollup2
KNOW AND THEN I JUST KIND OF

02:17:35.214 --> 02:17:39.051 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:17:36.849 --> 02:17:40.419 region:rollup2
THE IMPLICATIONS THAT HAS FOR

02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:42.054 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WHERE

02:17:40.419 --> 02:17:44.289 region:rollup2
BUILDING OUT FOR STARTING WITH

02:17:42.054 --> 02:17:44.990 region:rollup2
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:17:44.289 --> 02:17:45.891 region:rollup2
.

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:48.060 region:rollup2
I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK

02:17:45.891 --> 02:17:49.661 region:rollup2
TO THE FUTURE. AND MAKE SURE

02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:51.330 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TAILORING THE

02:17:49.661 --> 02:17:53.031 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO WHAT WE

02:17:51.330 --> 02:17:54.466 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE FUTURE NEEDS TO BE A

02:17:53.031 --> 02:17:55.601 region:rollup2
LOT MADE AN INTERESTING MAHLER

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.201 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD BUSES THAT CONNECT

02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:58.971 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

02:17:56.201 --> 02:18:00.239 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE ONLY DOT

02:17:58.971 --> 02:18:01.206 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF LA.

02:18:00.239 --> 02:18:02.741 region:rollup2
IS LOOKING TO PUT ON.

02:18:01.206 --> 02:18:04.376 region:rollup2
AND ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FOURTY

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:05.477 region:rollup2
FOUR ELECTRIC BUSES AND THEY'RE

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:06.545 region:rollup2
GOING TO DOUBLE THE GONNA USED

02:18:05.477 --> 02:18:07.846 region:rollup2
UP TO ACTION.

02:18:06.545 --> 02:18:09.314 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THEIR OF.

02:18:07.846 --> 02:18:10.682 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REDUCE THE TWELFTH

02:18:09.314 --> 02:18:12.151 region:rollup2
TIME AND THEY'RE EXPECTING A

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:13.385 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN

02:18:12.151 --> 02:18:14.920 region:rollup2
RIDERSHIP AND THAT WAS

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:16.922 region:rollup2
QUESTIONED BY THE CALTRANS WE

02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:18.257 region:rollup2
WENT BACK AND DID ANALYSIS WITH.

02:18:16.922 --> 02:18:20.859 region:rollup2
AND THEY CONFIRMED ON ALMOST A

02:18:18.257 --> 02:18:22.728 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT RIDERSHIP GAINS

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:23.262 region:rollup2
IN THE CITY OF LA BY ANY ON

02:18:22.728 --> 02:18:23.896 region:rollup2
THESE ELECTRIC BUSES THAT

02:18:23.262 --> 02:18:25.964 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO.

02:18:23.896 --> 02:18:28.400 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH A SHORT WHILE TIMES

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:32.137 region:rollup2
PATHS GOOD GOOD TO HEAR. MISTER

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:33.272 region:rollup2
TECH. GIPSON QUESTIONS AND YEAH

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:35.808 region:rollup2
JUST JUST FOR OUR.

02:18:33.272 --> 02:18:37.776 region:rollup2
MISTER HARRISON I JUST TRY TO

02:18:35.808 --> 02:18:39.077 region:rollup2
GET A SENSE OF HOW YOU ON.

02:18:37.776 --> 02:18:40.646 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT THE COST DIFFERENCE%

02:18:39.077 --> 02:18:42.948 region:rollup2
WAS FAIRLY HIGH BETWEEN LEVEL

02:18:40.646 --> 02:18:44.383 region:rollup2
THREE LEVEL TO. AND.

02:18:42.948 --> 02:18:46.051 region:rollup2
WITH IF YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:18:44.383 --> 02:18:47.819 region:rollup2
PROPERLY DISTRIBUTE LEVEL THREE

02:18:46.051 --> 02:18:49.254 region:rollup2
VERSES OF A TWO. AND A

02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:51.356 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. THROUGH THE

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:52.925 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS RELEVANT IS FOR FOLKS

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:55.227 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO.

02:18:52.925 --> 02:18:57.829 region:rollup2
CHARGING IN THEIR HOME BECAUSE.

02:18:55.227 --> 02:18:58.997 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT CHANGES THEIR THEIR

02:18:57.829 --> 02:19:01.066 region:rollup2
CHARGING NEEDS WHEN THEY'RE OUT.

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:02.634 region:rollup2
IN PUBLIC.

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:03.936 region:rollup2
YEAH GREAT QUESTION AS WELL SO.

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:06.205 region:rollup2
.

02:19:03.936 --> 02:19:07.272 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:19:06.205 --> 02:19:08.640 region:rollup2
ACROSS YOU KNOW LIKE THAT ALL

02:19:07.272 --> 02:19:10.275 region:rollup2
SECTORS IN IN IN ALL OF OUR

02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:11.543 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENTS.

02:19:10.275 --> 02:19:13.545 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST QUESTION IS GOING

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:14.713 region:rollup2
TO BE AROUND DWELL TIME SO FOR

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:15.614 region:rollup2
THE FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE

02:19:14.713 --> 02:19:16.415 region:rollup2
HERE HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING TO

02:19:15.614 --> 02:19:17.349 region:rollup2
BE HERE FOR BECAUSE THE

02:19:16.415 --> 02:19:18.717 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN THIS IN A GAS

02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:21.086 region:rollup2
STATION IS THIS IS A CHARGE

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:22.921 region:rollup2
WHILE YOU PARK. ON SO IT IT DE

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:24.189 region:rollup2
SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE TODAY

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:25.190 region:rollup2
WITH THE VEHICLES THAT ARE ON

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.291 region:rollup2
THE ROAD YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT

02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:27.025 region:rollup2
A TWENTY TO THIRTY MEN AND

02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:28.427 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THE FAST CHARGE.

02:19:27.025 --> 02:19:30.329 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW

02:19:28.427 --> 02:19:31.897 region:rollup2
LONG YOU HAVE SO IF IT'S A MULTI

02:19:30.329 --> 02:19:33.265 region:rollup2
FAMILY DWELLING AND THEY CAN

02:19:31.897 --> 02:19:34.233 region:rollup2
CHARGE OVERNIGHT THAT'S GOING TO

02:19:33.265 --> 02:19:35.767 region:rollup2
BE THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND THEY

02:19:34.233 --> 02:19:37.769 region:rollup2
CAN TO WELL THAT LONG SO THEN

02:19:35.767 --> 02:19:39.071 region:rollup2
LEVEL TWO WORKS PERFECTLY. ON IF

02:19:37.769 --> 02:19:40.305 region:rollup2
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS AROUND

02:19:39.071 --> 02:19:42.040 region:rollup2
THAT AND WE NEED FOLKS TO BE

02:19:40.305 --> 02:19:43.775 region:rollup2
ABLE TO HAVE HIGH TURNOVER.

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.744 region:rollup2
SUCH AS A RETAIL CENTER OR EVEN

02:19:43.775 --> 02:19:46.612 region:rollup2
IN A COMMON AREA OF A MULTI UNIT

02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:48.180 region:rollup2
DWELLING OR LONG HIGHWAY

02:19:46.612 --> 02:19:49.748 region:rollup2
CORRIDOR LEVEL THREE IS GOING TO

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:50.716 region:rollup2
BE THE PRIMARY APPLICATION THAT

02:19:49.748 --> 02:19:52.384 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE SUCH

02:19:50.716 --> 02:19:53.919 region:rollup2
REALLY. IF THE FIRST CRITERIA

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:55.554 region:rollup2
HOW LONG CAN THAT THE CAR SIT

02:19:53.919 --> 02:19:57.289 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT MAKES SENSE IN THE

02:19:55.554 --> 02:19:59.224 region:rollup2
SECOND CRATER IS GONNA BE ON

02:19:57.289 --> 02:20:00.692 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC I'M ONE OF THINGS THAT

02:19:59.224 --> 02:20:03.095 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS.

02:20:00.692 --> 02:20:03.528 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS THAT CANNOT CHARGE AT

02:20:03.095 --> 02:20:04.730 region:rollup2
HOME.

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:06.298 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE THEM

02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:07.933 region:rollup2
FROM CHARGING AFFORDABLE. AND

02:20:06.298 --> 02:20:09.368 region:rollup2
WHEN I I SAY THAT IS.

02:20:07.933 --> 02:20:10.569 region:rollup2
LEVEL THREE CHARGING THIS DC

02:20:09.368 --> 02:20:11.770 region:rollup2
VETERAN IS BECAUSE IT'S THE

02:20:10.569 --> 02:20:12.871 region:rollup2
HIGHEST ELECTRICAL BECAUSE IT'S

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:14.606 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE MORE

02:20:12.871 --> 02:20:15.974 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE WAY TO CHARGE SO IF

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:18.310 region:rollup2
THEY CAN AFFORD.

02:20:15.974 --> 02:20:20.212 region:rollup2
TOO BUT AGAIN HAVE THE LONGER

02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:21.246 region:rollup2
DWELL TIME THEN WE CAN OFFER

02:20:20.212 --> 02:20:23.482 region:rollup2
THEM AFFORDABLE CHARGING

02:20:21.246 --> 02:20:24.583 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND SO ON AS MUCH AS

02:20:23.482 --> 02:20:26.451 region:rollup2
WE CAN PROMOTE.

02:20:24.583 --> 02:20:28.053 region:rollup2
BOTH OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:28.987 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR

02:20:28.053 --> 02:20:30.656 region:rollup2
IN CASE THEY NEED TO GET A QUICK

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:32.925 region:rollup2
CHARGE ON BUT HAVE THE

02:20:30.656 --> 02:20:34.159 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE OPTION OF A LONGER

02:20:32.925 --> 02:20:36.561 region:rollup2
DWELL TIME LEVEL TO CHARGE.

02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:38.263 region:rollup2
BUT THE TYPICAL LEVEL THREE

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:39.631 region:rollup2
CHARGE I MEAN I I'VE.

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.866 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN SINGED YOUR COMPANY

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:42.968 region:rollup2
WITH LEVEL THREES BUT HOW HOW

02:20:40.866 --> 02:20:44.436 region:rollup2
MUCH WHAT THE TYPICAL CHARGE FOR

02:20:42.968 --> 02:20:46.772 region:rollup2
LEVEL THREE CHARTER.

02:20:44.436 --> 02:20:48.573 region:rollup2
THE COST FOR THE CHARGER OR THE

02:20:46.772 --> 02:20:49.775 region:rollup2
COST FOR THAT ON THE CONSUMER.

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:50.575 region:rollup2
IT IS A MINUTE TRIP DE OF THE

02:20:49.775 --> 02:20:52.277 region:rollup2
FUELING.

02:20:50.575 --> 02:20:54.212 region:rollup2
AND IT'S

02:20:52.277 --> 02:20:55.180 region:rollup2
IT IT IT VARIES BECAUSE THERE'S

02:20:54.212 --> 02:20:57.282 region:rollup2
NOT A COMMENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:58.550 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA PRICE BUT IN MOST

02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:59.618 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS THE CYCLES OF SELF

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.019 region:rollup2
SERVE TO TO CLARIFY CHARGE WHEN

02:20:59.618 --> 02:21:02.387 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SET THOSE PRICES WHOEVER

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:04.323 region:rollup2
OWNS THE STATION THE SITE IS

02:21:02.387 --> 02:21:05.057 region:rollup2
GONNA SET THOSE PRICES. BUT

02:21:04.323 --> 02:21:06.992 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SPEAKING.

02:21:05.057 --> 02:21:08.093 region:rollup2
BASED ON A LOCAL ACTORS BECAUSE

02:21:06.992 --> 02:21:09.294 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO SET THE PRICING AT

02:21:08.093 --> 02:21:09.895 region:rollup2
LOWER THAN THE COST OF A

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:12.064 region:rollup2
GASOLINE EQUIVALENT PRICE AND

02:21:09.895 --> 02:21:13.832 region:rollup2
SO.

02:21:12.064 --> 02:21:15.701 region:rollup2
FOR A YOU KNOW THIRTY MINUTE

02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:16.068 region:rollup2
CHARGE TO GET EIGHTY PERCENT

02:21:15.701 --> 02:21:19.071 region:rollup2
FULL.

02:21:16.068 --> 02:21:20.439 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT SHOULD BE UP A

02:21:19.071 --> 02:21:20.672 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DOLLARS BUT IT JUST

02:21:20.439 --> 02:21:22.140 region:rollup2
DEPENDS

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:24.242 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:21:22.140 --> 02:21:25.544 region:rollup2
IT AND I AM MUCH.

02:21:24.242 --> 02:21:26.545 region:rollup2
MYERSON APART APOLOGIZE I DON'T

02:21:25.544 --> 02:21:28.280 region:rollup2
HAVE THE EXACT STUDY BY THE

02:21:26.545 --> 02:21:28.847 region:rollup2
HEARD IS A STUDY THAT JUST

02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:29.648 region:rollup2
RECENTLY GOT RELEASED DUTCH

02:21:28.847 --> 02:21:32.217 region:rollup2
SAYS.

02:21:29.648 --> 02:21:32.851 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A LOT OF.

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:34.086 region:rollup2
HOME.

02:21:32.851 --> 02:21:35.687 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE CHARGING AT

02:21:34.086 --> 02:21:37.522 region:rollup2
HOME AND.

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:39.591 region:rollup2
CHARGING AT LEVEL THREE.

02:21:37.522 --> 02:21:41.393 region:rollup2
STATIONS BECAUSE IT JUST OUT

02:21:39.591 --> 02:21:42.861 region:rollup2
ABOUT IN THE NEED TO GET THAT.

02:21:41.393 --> 02:21:44.629 region:rollup2
BOSTON THE TO GET A FULL CHARGES

02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:45.931 region:rollup2
FAST POSSIBLE THAT HAS THAT BEEN

02:21:44.629 --> 02:21:48.600 region:rollup2
YOUR EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU SEEN

02:21:45.931 --> 02:21:51.303 region:rollup2
STUDIES OR ANYTHING. THAT DOWN

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:51.937 region:rollup2
COULD RESERVE EDUCATE US AS TO

02:21:51.303 --> 02:21:53.071 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PROPER DEPLOYMENT WOULD

02:21:51.937 --> 02:21:54.806 region:rollup2
BE.

02:21:53.071 --> 02:21:56.775 region:rollup2
YEAH IT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE

02:21:54.806 --> 02:22:00.312 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THE AREA FOR US WHAT

02:21:56.775 --> 02:22:02.581 region:rollup2
WE FIND IS ON.

02:22:00.312 --> 02:22:04.549 region:rollup2
WE'VE OUT THE ABILITY TO CHARGE

02:22:02.581 --> 02:22:06.752 region:rollup2
AT HOME OR WORK IF YOU REMOVE

02:22:04.549 --> 02:22:08.086 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO OPTIONS AND THAT'S

02:22:06.752 --> 02:22:10.322 region:rollup2
WHERE IT BECOMES EXTREMELY

02:22:08.086 --> 02:22:11.523 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING AND YOU HAVE TO RELY

02:22:10.322 --> 02:22:12.591 region:rollup2
ON PUBLIC FASTER AGING BECAUSE.

02:22:11.523 --> 02:22:14.393 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOOK FOR

02:22:12.591 --> 02:22:16.294 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WHERE I'M GOING TO GO

02:22:14.393 --> 02:22:16.895 region:rollup2
TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I'M

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:18.196 region:rollup2
GONNA BE IN THE GROCERY STORE

02:22:16.895 --> 02:22:19.731 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AN

02:22:18.196 --> 02:22:21.166 region:rollup2
HOUR I WANT TO GET. AS FULL OR

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.901 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY FULL AS POSSIBLE THAT

02:22:21.166 --> 02:22:23.502 region:rollup2
TIME AGAIN THIS IS IF I DON'T

02:22:22.901 --> 02:22:24.469 region:rollup2
HAVE THE OPTION CHARGING HOME

02:22:23.502 --> 02:22:27.005 region:rollup2
SO.

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:27.906 region:rollup2
FOR FOR OUR COMPANY WILL WE

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:30.108 region:rollup2
FIND IS THAT.

02:22:27.906 --> 02:22:31.710 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A LOT IN PRIMARY OF

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:34.012 region:rollup2
OUR DEPLOYMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND

02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:36.348 region:rollup2
IN THE WORKPLACE JUST BECAUSE

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:37.549 region:rollup2
THAT BEAT THAT TENDS TO BE A ONE

02:22:36.348 --> 02:22:39.217 region:rollup2
AREA WHERE YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE

02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:41.686 region:rollup2
GONNA BE THERE FOR. EIGHT HOURS

02:22:39.217 --> 02:22:43.388 region:rollup2
PLUS AND YOU CAN USUALLY CHARGE

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:44.556 region:rollup2
EITHER AFFORDABLY OR A LOT OF

02:22:43.388 --> 02:22:45.457 region:rollup2
WORK PLACES I'D SAY THAT THE

02:22:44.556 --> 02:22:47.793 region:rollup2
VAST VERY WORKPLACES.

02:22:45.457 --> 02:22:49.761 region:rollup2
DON'T CHARGE THE EMPLOYEES AT

02:22:47.793 --> 02:22:51.363 region:rollup2
ALL ON BECAUSE. WHEN YOU'RE

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:52.831 region:rollup2
CHARGING FOR AYE THAT LONG

02:22:51.363 --> 02:22:54.466 region:rollup2
REPEATED TIME THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:22:52.831 --> 02:22:55.200 region:rollup2
NOT THAT HIVE ELECTRICITY COSTS

02:22:54.466 --> 02:22:57.636 region:rollup2
A SERIES WITH A SINGLE LEVEL

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:59.671 region:rollup2
THREE CHARGE. SO THAT AND THEN

02:22:57.636 --> 02:23:01.006 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY A HUGE NEED IF IF

02:22:59.671 --> 02:23:02.574 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON

02:23:01.006 --> 02:23:05.677 region:rollup2
EFFORTS I WOULD SAY NUMBER ONE

02:23:02.574 --> 02:23:06.411 region:rollup2
BARRIER TODAY IS TENANTS AND

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:08.847 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY DO NOT OWN THEIR

02:23:06.411 --> 02:23:09.681 region:rollup2
PROPERTY THERE IN SOME SORT OF.

02:23:08.847 --> 02:23:10.749 region:rollup2
MULTI UNIT DWELLING CHAIR

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:12.984 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

02:23:10.749 --> 02:23:16.721 region:rollup2
IT CONTINUES TO BE THE BIGGEST

02:23:12.984 --> 02:23:17.289 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO EVEN

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:17.522 region:rollup2
CHARGING DEPLOYMENT IS THAT

02:23:17.289 --> 02:23:17.823 region:rollup2
SECTOR.

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:19.024 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:23:17.823 --> 02:23:20.725 region:rollup2
THANK YOU IF THERE'S NO FURTHER

OKAY.

02:23:36.975 --> 02:23:40.812 region:rollup2
I APOLOGIZE OF MISTER TING. HAD

02:23:40.178 --> 02:23:46.651 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:47.686 region:rollup2
PANELISTS.

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:57.896 region:rollup2
PANEL ONE CAN WE BRING PANEL ONE

02:23:47.686 --> 02:24:06.605 region:rollup2
BACK UP.

02:23:57.896 --> 02:24:08.673 region:rollup2
GIVE ME ON MY TOES HERE TODAY.

02:24:06.605 --> 02:24:09.941 region:rollup2
THREE TAKE MY APOLOGIES FOR.

02:24:08.673 --> 02:24:11.409 region:rollup2
STEPPING OUT I THINK I WAS

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:13.778 region:rollup2
ARMED.

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:15.247 region:rollup2
.

02:24:13.778 --> 02:24:16.848 region:rollup2
YOU TO QUIT THE QUESTION AROUND

02:24:15.247 --> 02:24:18.383 region:rollup2
DIE I.

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.717 region:rollup2
HER THE FIRST PRESENTATION. AND

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:20.252 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT.

02:24:18.717 --> 02:24:24.389 region:rollup2
.

02:24:20.252 --> 02:24:25.123 region:rollup2
ONE TWO ELEVEN. RATIO REGARDING

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:26.691 region:rollup2
THE.

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:27.726 region:rollup2
CHARGING STATIONS TO ELECTRIC

02:24:26.691 --> 02:24:28.827 region:rollup2
VEHICLES.

02:24:27.726 --> 02:24:30.195 region:rollup2
TRY TO GET A BETTER

02:24:28.827 --> 02:24:32.230 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF.

02:24:30.195 --> 02:24:33.565 region:rollup2
HOW THAT NUMBER WAS DEVELOPED

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:36.134 region:rollup2
IN THAT ALSO?

02:24:33.565 --> 02:24:39.437 region:rollup2
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND. ON HOW

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:41.406 region:rollup2
YOU DEVELOPED THE MIX BETWEEN.

02:24:39.437 --> 02:24:43.508 region:rollup2
LEVEL ONE AND LEVEL TWO FAST

02:24:41.406 --> 02:24:45.777 region:rollup2
CHARGERS CLICK THINK. WHERE

02:24:43.508 --> 02:24:47.212 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION NOW

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:48.780 region:rollup2
LOBBY BECAUSE WE'RE FINALLY

02:24:47.212 --> 02:24:50.882 region:rollup2
GETTING SOME CRITICAL MASS OF

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:52.284 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALSO WITH?

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:55.186 region:rollup2
BROADER RANGE I THINK THE.

02:24:52.284 --> 02:24:57.956 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL THREE LEVEL TO LEVEL

02:24:55.186 --> 02:25:00.091 region:rollup2
ONE DEMANDS ARE STARTING TO.

02:24:57.956 --> 02:25:01.493 region:rollup2
EVOLVE YES I WANNA GET BETTER

02:25:00.091 --> 02:25:03.895 region:rollup2
SAY THAT IT'S MILK IT OFF AND

02:25:01.493 --> 02:25:04.930 region:rollup2
YOU CAN. SO THAT LIMIT ONE IS

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:06.831 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY A BACK CALCULATION

02:25:04.930 --> 02:25:08.333 region:rollup2
SO THEY THEN ALICE'S THAT THE CC

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:09.868 region:rollup2
DID WAS REALLY DRIVEN AROUND

02:25:08.333 --> 02:25:11.336 region:rollup2
GETTING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

02:25:09.868 --> 02:25:12.537 region:rollup2
SAD SO I BACK ONE POINT THREE

02:25:11.336 --> 02:25:15.106 region:rollup2
MILLION BE PLUG ELECTRIC

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:17.676 region:rollup2
VEHICLES. USE THE NATIONAL HOUSE

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:18.677 region:rollup2
WILL TRAVEL SURVEY DATA DID IT.

02:25:17.676 --> 02:25:20.111 region:rollup2
FROM THE GROUND UP HOW MANY

02:25:18.677 --> 02:25:22.480 region:rollup2
CHARTERS DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:23.682 region:rollup2
THAT THESE DIANNE DRIVERS CAN

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.152 region:rollup2
GET THE ELECTRICITY THEY NEED TO

02:25:23.682 --> 02:25:27.852 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THEIR NORMAL DRIVING

02:25:27.152 --> 02:25:28.453 region:rollup2
PATTERNS.

02:25:27.852 --> 02:25:29.254 region:rollup2
AND SO THE ELEVEN A ONE IS A

02:25:28.453 --> 02:25:30.622 region:rollup2
COMPARISON TO WHERE WE ARE IN

02:25:29.254 --> 02:25:32.023 region:rollup2
THE COMPARED TO OTHER

02:25:30.622 --> 02:25:34.059 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS IS NOT LIKE A KEY

02:25:32.023 --> 02:25:35.493 region:rollup2
FIND OF REPORTS ARE REALLY IF

02:25:34.059 --> 02:25:37.495 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THAT REPORT ITS ACT.

02:25:35.493 --> 02:25:38.830 region:rollup2
I'M THE SPREAD BASED ON HOW MUCH

02:25:37.495 --> 02:25:40.432 region:rollup2
CHARGES ARE SHARED.

02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:41.933 region:rollup2
IN THE PUBLIC WORKS BUT IN THE

02:25:40.432 --> 02:25:43.068 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SPACE OF PUBLIC CHARGING

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:44.970 region:rollup2
A WORKPLACE CHARGING THAT

02:25:43.068 --> 02:25:46.504 region:rollup2
REACHES BETWEEN THIRTEEN TO WINE

02:25:44.970 --> 02:25:48.206 region:rollup2
AND NINE TO ONE DEPENDING.

02:25:46.504 --> 02:25:49.474 region:rollup2
TO THE AND THAT'S IT CORRESPONDS

02:25:48.206 --> 02:25:52.277 region:rollup2
THAT SPREAD THAT'S IN THE ETI

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:53.578 region:rollup2
PEROT. REPORT THANK YOU AND THEN

02:25:52.277 --> 02:25:54.913 region:rollup2
THE GAP IS A HUNDRED AND.

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:56.615 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY

02:25:54.913 --> 02:25:58.216 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND.

02:25:56.615 --> 02:25:59.918 region:rollup2
YES OVERALL WE'RE PROJECTING YOU

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:01.453 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:25:59.918 --> 02:26:02.420 region:rollup2
IN THE BELLY ó GAP ANNOUNCED

02:26:01.453 --> 02:26:04.122 region:rollup2
TO BE DONE WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:06.191 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CHARTERS YEAH AT ALL

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:06.958 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS TOGETHER. AND IT

02:26:06.191 --> 02:26:08.860 region:rollup2
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:09.894 region:rollup2
FIVE IS WHAT WE THINK WE CAN BE

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:10.962 region:rollup2
INTO THE GAP WOULD BE ABOUT A

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:13.164 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:14.633 region:rollup2
FOR WORKPLACE PUBLIC AND MULTI

02:26:13.164 --> 02:26:15.500 region:rollup2
UNIT DWELLING.

02:26:14.633 --> 02:26:16.801 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT'S BASED ON AN

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:18.436 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE OF HITTING ONE POINT

02:26:16.801 --> 02:26:20.138 region:rollup2
FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:21.673 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE. BETTER AND THE

02:26:20.138 --> 02:26:22.841 region:rollup2
TUTOR FIFTY THOUSAND AS.

02:26:21.673 --> 02:26:24.843 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY BIT SORRY BETWEEN

02:26:22.841 --> 02:26:25.577 region:rollup2
FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGER TARGETS

02:26:24.843 --> 02:26:28.213 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE ONE POINT FIVE

02:26:25.577 --> 02:26:29.314 region:rollup2
MILLION ZEV TARGET IN TWENTY

02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:31.116 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE.

02:26:29.314 --> 02:26:32.450 region:rollup2
SOME EXTENT. IT DOES BUT JUST

02:26:31.116 --> 02:26:34.753 region:rollup2
THE MATH DOESN'T SO I GUESS WHEN

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:36.421 region:rollup2
I DIVIDE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

02:26:34.753 --> 02:26:38.023 region:rollup2
BY ALIVE I GOT A HUNDRED AND

02:26:36.421 --> 02:26:38.556 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX THOUSAND.

02:26:38.023 --> 02:26:41.126 region:rollup2
BOISE SO THEY.

02:26:38.556 --> 02:26:42.761 region:rollup2
SO SINCE IT'S ONE POINT THREE

02:26:41.126 --> 02:26:43.428 region:rollup2
MILLION SAID THAT THERE'S.

02:26:42.761 --> 02:26:45.096 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN THERE THAT'S CONFUSING

02:26:43.428 --> 02:26:46.998 region:rollup2
IS THAT GONNA FIFTY THOUSAND

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:48.233 region:rollup2
INCLUDES MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS.

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:49.834 region:rollup2
SO THE RATIO THAT WE COMPARE

02:26:48.233 --> 02:26:50.735 region:rollup2
TODAY THOSE RATIOS THAT I

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:53.238 region:rollup2
MENTIONED FROM.

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:55.473 region:rollup2
EXTROVERTED THE INTERNAL THE

02:26:53.238 --> 02:26:58.343 region:rollup2
INTERNAL AYE CCTV INTERNATIONAL

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:59.477 region:rollup2
COUNCIL UNCLEAN TRANSPORTATION.

02:26:58.343 --> 02:27:00.879 region:rollup2
DID A STUDY FOR US

02:26:59.477 --> 02:27:02.447 region:rollup2
IT IS PART OF HIS THAT ALLIANCE

02:27:00.879 --> 02:27:03.915 region:rollup2
AND THEY LOOK AT PUBLIC AND

02:27:02.447 --> 02:27:05.550 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CHARGING THOSE OF US

02:27:03.915 --> 02:27:07.585 region:rollup2
WHO THOSE RATIOS ARE BASED ON.

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:09.187 region:rollup2
AND SO WITHIN THE CDC REPORT I

02:27:07.585 --> 02:27:10.989 region:rollup2
THINK YOU SEE THAT. PUBLIC ON

02:27:09.187 --> 02:27:12.757 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CHARGING NUMBERS THAT

02:27:10.989 --> 02:27:13.792 region:rollup2
WE NEED IS AND I'M NOT GOING TO

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:15.960 region:rollup2
MEMORIES OF PLEASE FORGIVE ME

02:27:13.792 --> 02:27:17.429 region:rollup2
FROM ABOUT NINETY NINE THOUSAND

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:18.830 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND.

02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:20.065 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU DIVIDE THAT BY ONE

02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:22.167 region:rollup2
POINT THREE MILLION STATE AGAIN.

02:27:20.065 --> 02:27:24.035 region:rollup2
SO THAT. SO NOT INCLUDING MULTI

02:27:22.167 --> 02:27:25.637 region:rollup2
UNIT DWELLINGS.

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:27.205 region:rollup2
IN THAT PUBLIC SPACE A WORKPLACE

02:27:25.637 --> 02:27:30.642 region:rollup2
AND.

02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:31.910 region:rollup2
AND PUBLIC OF BELIEVABLE.

02:27:30.642 --> 02:27:32.944 region:rollup2
AND I OUT OF PULL NOT THE

02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:34.979 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE ABOUT LIKE NINETY

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:36.514 region:rollup2
NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

02:27:34.979 --> 02:27:38.183 region:rollup2
THOUSAND IS THE RANGE THAT THE

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:38.550 region:rollup2
ENTERED THE EVA PRO MODELS FOR

02:27:38.183 --> 02:27:43.588 region:rollup2
IS THE DEMAND.

02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:45.023 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:46.991 region:rollup2
THAT OF OTHER THAN THAT'S THE

02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:48.893 region:rollup2
GAP THAT YOU NEED.

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:50.562 region:rollup2
JUST IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:52.397 region:rollup2
AND WORKPLACE WE ALSO ARE. WITH

02:27:50.562 --> 02:27:53.031 region:rollup2
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING

02:27:52.397 --> 02:27:55.533 region:rollup2
MULTI UNIT DRAWINGS WHICH IS THE

02:27:53.031 --> 02:27:57.202 region:rollup2
KEY.

02:27:55.533 --> 02:27:59.738 region:rollup2
OKAY I I JUST I GUESS I'D BE

02:27:57.202 --> 02:28:00.905 region:rollup2
BASED ON YOUR. PRESENTATION IT

02:27:59.738 --> 02:28:02.741 region:rollup2
DIDN'T QUITE MAKES.

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:05.510 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR.

02:28:02.741 --> 02:28:08.346 region:rollup2
GAP ANALYSIS DON'T MAKE SENSE.

02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:11.249 region:rollup2
SO ARM MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME

02:28:08.346 --> 02:28:11.883 region:rollup2
GREATER DETAIL JR REGARDING THAT

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:13.118 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

02:28:11.883 --> 02:28:15.687 region:rollup2
TO.

02:28:13.118 --> 02:28:16.488 region:rollup2
THEN SEPARATE THE SEGMENTS IF

02:28:15.687 --> 02:28:17.422 region:rollup2
YOU ARE SEPARATING SEGMENTS

02:28:16.488 --> 02:28:21.092 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:28:17.422 --> 02:28:22.427 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC. MULTI

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:24.362 region:rollup2
FAMILY THAT'S A SEPARATE

02:28:22.427 --> 02:28:25.797 region:rollup2
STRATEGY ON SEPARATE ANALYSIS

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:27.699 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE WE'D LIKE TO.

02:28:25.797 --> 02:28:29.968 region:rollup2
SEE THAT MORE.

02:28:27.699 --> 02:28:32.103 region:rollup2
PACIFIC WING YES ARMED.

02:28:29.968 --> 02:28:34.005 region:rollup2
IN IT I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:36.040 region:rollup2
PART SPECIFICALLY OF THIS

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:36.274 region:rollup2
HEARING BUT. THEY CAN TERMS ON

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.077 region:rollup2
OF THE.

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:43.348 region:rollup2
.

02:28:39.077 --> 02:28:44.916 region:rollup2
CV R. P. PROGRAM. ON.

02:28:43.348 --> 02:28:45.817 region:rollup2
WHAT? WHAT GAVE?

02:28:44.916 --> 02:28:48.253 region:rollup2
?

02:28:45.817 --> 02:28:50.088 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

02:28:48.253 --> 02:28:51.623 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE ARMY?

02:28:50.088 --> 02:28:53.057 region:rollup2
YEAH WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:28:51.623 --> 02:28:55.493 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE MY OFFICE.

02:28:53.057 --> 02:28:57.862 region:rollup2
THINK WEEK OR TWO AGO. ARE.

02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:59.798 region:rollup2
WHAT NUMBERS DO WE HAVE TO

02:28:57.862 --> 02:29:01.633 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE COULD GET TO THAT

02:28:59.798 --> 02:29:04.569 region:rollup2
ONE POINT FIVE AND THE FIVE

02:29:01.633 --> 02:29:06.004 region:rollup2
MILLION VEHICLE CALLED?

02:29:04.569 --> 02:29:07.639 region:rollup2
IF YOU I'M SURE YET OF THIS A

02:29:06.004 --> 02:29:08.573 region:rollup2
STEEP CLIFF IN THE CALIFORNIA

02:29:07.639 --> 02:29:10.642 region:rollup2
AIR RESOURCES BOARD.

02:29:08.573 --> 02:29:12.911 region:rollup2
THAT SO THAT THE TWO HUNDRED

02:29:10.642 --> 02:29:14.179 region:rollup2
MILLION A YEAR WE BELIEVE AT THE

02:29:12.911 --> 02:29:15.814 region:rollup2
CURRENT REBATE AMOUNTS IS

02:29:14.179 --> 02:29:17.949 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE DEMAND

02:29:15.814 --> 02:29:20.318 region:rollup2
FOR REBATES. YOU KNOW IN THAT IN

02:29:17.949 --> 02:29:22.053 region:rollup2
THE NEAR FUTURE WE EXPECT THAT

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:23.755 region:rollup2
OVER TIME THOSE REBATES AT THE

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:25.423 region:rollup2
REBATE AMOUNTS WOULD NEED TO BE

02:29:23.755 --> 02:29:27.125 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO HIT THOSE

02:29:25.423 --> 02:29:29.494 region:rollup2
HIGHER TARGETS. AND THAT'S

02:29:27.125 --> 02:29:31.229 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AS THE MARKET

02:29:29.494 --> 02:29:33.097 region:rollup2
BECOMES MORE SUSTAINABLE THERE'S

02:29:31.229 --> 02:29:34.699 region:rollup2
MORE UPTAKE OF THOSE VEHICLES

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:37.101 region:rollup2
AND WE EXPECT THAT LESS REBATE

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:40.839 region:rollup2
WILL BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:44.542 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THOSE HIGHER TARGETS.

02:29:40.839 --> 02:29:46.177 region:rollup2
OKAY GREAT. SO I'M JUST.

02:29:44.542 --> 02:29:47.712 region:rollup2
DOING SOME DIVISION YOU GO TWO

02:29:46.177 --> 02:29:49.080 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DIVIDED BY THE

02:29:47.712 --> 02:29:50.715 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YOU GET

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:52.250 region:rollup2
EIGHTY THOUSAND TIMES EIGHT.

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:53.785 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:29:52.250 --> 02:29:57.355 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:29:53.785 --> 02:29:59.023 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL CARS.

02:29:57.355 --> 02:29:59.958 region:rollup2
WHERE DO YOU GET WHAT WOULD WE

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:01.993 region:rollup2
GET THE ADDITIONAL?

02:29:59.958 --> 02:30:03.628 region:rollup2
CARS.

02:30:01.993 --> 02:30:04.696 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO USING THE LEVELS OF

02:30:03.628 --> 02:30:07.065 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR AN

02:30:04.696 --> 02:30:08.166 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLE M. OF COURSE

02:30:07.065 --> 02:30:10.101 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MIX BETWEEN PLUGIN

02:30:08.166 --> 02:30:11.102 region:rollup2
HYBRIDS ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:13.338 region:rollup2
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES SO

02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:16.074 region:rollup2
THAT. THE RANGES VERY.

02:30:13.338 --> 02:30:17.208 region:rollup2
BUT AS I MENTIONED I THINK OVER

02:30:16.074 --> 02:30:19.110 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:30:17.208 --> 02:30:20.478 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO

02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:22.480 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:24.315 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:25.683 region:rollup2
THAT TO HER MILLION DOLLAR. PER

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:27.619 region:rollup2
YEAR LIMIT.

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:29.621 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE

02:30:27.619 --> 02:30:31.489 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT

02:30:29.621 --> 02:30:34.158 region:rollup2
OF INCENTIVE ON A PER VEHICLE

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:35.894 region:rollup2
BASIS OR I'M CONSIDER HOW TO

02:30:34.158 --> 02:30:37.328 region:rollup2
ADJUST THOSE.

02:30:35.894 --> 02:30:39.764 region:rollup2
REBATES

02:30:37.328 --> 02:30:42.133 region:rollup2
TWO ON TARGET THOSE WHO WOULD BE

02:30:39.764 --> 02:30:43.434 region:rollup2
MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE REBATES

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:45.270 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN THINK OF OTHER THINGS

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:47.372 region:rollup2
SUCH AS AN ANSWER P. CAPS. WHERE

02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:49.307 region:rollup2
THERE'S RT INCOME CAPS THAT ARE

02:30:47.372 --> 02:30:51.276 region:rollup2
IN PLACE RATHER TYPES OF? IN

02:30:49.307 --> 02:30:53.011 region:rollup2
TERMS OF RIGHT SO FAR WE'VE BEEN

02:30:51.276 --> 02:30:54.212 region:rollup2
DOING THIS PROGRAM FOR A COUPLE

02:30:53.011 --> 02:30:56.014 region:rollup2
YEARS NOW WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S.

02:30:54.212 --> 02:30:56.614 region:rollup2
YOUR DATA DEMONSTRATE TERMS OF

02:30:56.014 --> 02:30:58.316 region:rollup2
WHAT'S MOVING PEOPLE IN TERMS

02:30:56.614 --> 02:31:01.152 region:rollup2
OF.

02:30:58.316 --> 02:31:02.720 region:rollup2
REBATE AMOUNT.

02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:03.955 region:rollup2
WELL THE STUDIES

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:05.390 region:rollup2
THAT THE REASON THIS TWENTY FIVE

02:31:03.955 --> 02:31:07.091 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AMOUNT WHAT'S SAD IS

02:31:05.390 --> 02:31:08.393 region:rollup2
THAT THE STUDIES THAT SHOWED AND

02:31:07.091 --> 02:31:09.928 region:rollup2
THROUGH PUBLIC PROCESS WE

02:31:08.393 --> 02:31:11.696 region:rollup2
DETERMINED THAT.

02:31:09.928 --> 02:31:14.165 region:rollup2
THAT AN OVERALL REBATE FOR THE

02:31:11.696 --> 02:31:15.967 region:rollup2
TYPICAL VEHICLE SUCH AS A NISSAN

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:17.669 region:rollup2
LEAF THAT'S OUT THERE TODAY.

02:31:15.967 --> 02:31:19.003 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND

02:31:17.669 --> 02:31:20.438 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SO THAT IT WOULD INCLUDE

02:31:19.003 --> 02:31:21.439 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WHICH IS

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:23.441 region:rollup2
AN INCENTIVE AT SEVENTY FIVE

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:24.042 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS. PLUS THE TWENTY

02:31:23.441 --> 02:31:25.810 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE

02:31:24.042 --> 02:31:27.712 region:rollup2
STATE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE THAT

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:28.780 region:rollup2
OVERALL LEVEL. THAT WAS AND HOW

02:31:27.712 --> 02:31:29.781 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:31.549 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED BACK IN TWENTY

02:31:29.781 --> 02:31:32.984 region:rollup2
ELEVEN AND THAT'S STILL

02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:34.719 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WE BELIEVE TODAY

02:31:32.984 --> 02:31:35.954 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN

02:31:34.719 --> 02:31:37.388 region:rollup2
THE MARKETPLACE.

02:31:35.954 --> 02:31:39.490 region:rollup2
I'M GOING FORWARD.

02:31:37.388 --> 02:31:40.124 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S A QUESTION

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:42.226 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD

02:31:40.124 --> 02:31:43.261 region:rollup2
NEED TO.

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:44.629 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS WE LOSE THE FEDERAL

02:31:43.261 --> 02:31:46.664 region:rollup2
TAX GRAY?

02:31:44.629 --> 02:31:47.966 region:rollup2
SO.

02:31:46.664 --> 02:31:48.433 region:rollup2
THERE'S WHICH IS A GOOD THING

02:31:47.966 --> 02:31:49.534 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE BEING

02:31:48.433 --> 02:31:50.268 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

02:31:49.534 --> 02:31:52.103 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:31:50.268 --> 02:31:53.504 region:rollup2
THERE AS AS YEAR NOTING THE

02:31:52.103 --> 02:31:54.872 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AS IT'S

02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:57.108 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ENVISIONED WOULD GO

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:59.444 region:rollup2
AWAY OR WOULD START TO GO AWAY.

02:31:57.108 --> 02:32:00.979 region:rollup2
IT IT PHASES DOWN IN A

02:31:59.444 --> 02:32:03.915 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY COMPLICATED FASHION.

02:32:00.979 --> 02:32:04.716 region:rollup2
WHEN MANUFACTURERS SELL MORE

02:32:03.915 --> 02:32:06.150 region:rollup2
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:32:04.716 --> 02:32:07.619 region:rollup2
VEHICLES OF.

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:09.087 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

02:32:07.619 --> 02:32:10.188 region:rollup2
REBATE AND IT'S ON A PER

02:32:09.087 --> 02:32:12.423 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURE BASIS.

02:32:10.188 --> 02:32:14.892 region:rollup2
THERE IS AND THERE HAS BEEN A

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:16.461 region:rollup2
PUSH AT AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:17.629 region:rollup2
TO EXTEND THAT.

02:32:16.461 --> 02:32:19.831 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT.

02:32:17.629 --> 02:32:21.299 region:rollup2
RECENTLY A LOT OF UTILITIES

02:32:19.831 --> 02:32:23.434 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN MAKING A VERY STRONG

02:32:21.299 --> 02:32:26.371 region:rollup2
PUSHING CONGRESS TO EXTEND THAT.

02:32:23.434 --> 02:32:28.940 region:rollup2
IT AT WILL DISNEY TO MONITOR

02:32:26.371 --> 02:32:31.175 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION AS IT GOES ALONG.

02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:33.811 region:rollup2
GREAT I'M IN IN TERMS OF.

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:35.279 region:rollup2
STUDIES IS IT YOUR FAITH AT THE

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:36.781 region:rollup2
RB THAT'S BEEN DOING THE STUDIES

02:32:35.279 --> 02:32:38.149 region:rollup2
OR IS IT.

02:32:36.781 --> 02:32:40.651 region:rollup2
YOU SEE OR WHAT STUDIES ARE YOU

02:32:38.149 --> 02:32:41.886 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO.

02:32:40.651 --> 02:32:43.287 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OUR OWN DATA BUT WE WORK

02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:44.222 region:rollup2
WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

02:32:43.287 --> 02:32:45.657 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS.

02:32:44.222 --> 02:32:46.824 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER

02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:48.626 region:rollup2

02:42:54.098 --> 02:42:57.935 region:rollup2
NOW EXCEED ALL OF THE CLIMATE

02:42:56.367 --> 02:42:59.270 region:rollup2

LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT BIOFUELS.

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:25.329 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING

02:43:24.061 --> 02:43:27.097 region:rollup2
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

02:43:25.329 --> 02:43:29.600 region:rollup2
AND BIOFUELS TO MEET THE STATE'S

02:43:27.097 --> 02:43:30.167 region:rollup2
CLIMATE STRATEGY IT IS SHOCKING

02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:32.269 region:rollup2
THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

FOR BIOFUELS PRODUCTION EVEN

02:43:37.408 --> 02:43:42.046 region:rollup2
THOUGH. BIOGAS FROM DIVERTED

02:43:39.643 --> 02:43:43.480 region:rollup2
ORGANIC WASTE OR DAIRY IS THE

02:43:42.046 --> 02:43:45.282 region:rollup2
ONLY CARBON NEGATIVE FUEL IN

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.984 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE AND THOSE FUELS ARE

02:43:45.282 --> 02:43:48.218 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO ME ARE SHORT LIVED

02:43:46.984 --> 02:43:49.620 region:rollup2
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS STRATEGY AND

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:50.788 region:rollup2

02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:59.997 region:rollup2
AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS.

02:43:58.762 --> 02:44:01.498 region:rollup2
THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS

02:43:59.997 --> 02:44:03.300 region:rollup2
NOT MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT BY

02:44:01.498 --> 02:44:05.636 region:rollup2

ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL

02:45:57.548 --> 02:46:01.618 region:rollup2
IS DOING IS SIMPLY MAKING IT. AN

02:46:04.621 --> 02:46:07.691 region:rollup2
AT THE DISADVANTAGE

BIODIESEL INDUSTRY.

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:17.601 region:rollup2
THAT IS A DROP IN FUEL

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:19.136 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT THAT IS

02:46:17.601 --> 02:46:20.304 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL OTHER

02:46:19.136 --> 02:46:22.072 region:rollup2

EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE.

02:46:24.508 --> 02:46:27.377 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO

02:46:26.310 --> 02:46:28.946 region:rollup2
FAR FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:31.915 region:rollup2
SECTOR WERE NOW BEING HUNG OUT

02:46:28.946 --> 02:46:33.450 region:rollup2
TO DRY WITH ZERO DOLLARS.

02:46:31.915 --> 02:46:35.118 region:rollup2
WERE GIVEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:46:33.450 --> 02:46:36.620 region:rollup2
IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:38.088 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST A ONE YEAR DEAL.

02:46:36.620 --> 02:46:39.389 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:40.891 region:rollup2
THE AB ONE EIGHTEEN MONIES

02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:42.459 region:rollup2

TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND AT LEAST

02:46:42.459 --> 02:46:44.895 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THAT

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:47.297 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS A

02:46:44.895 --> 02:46:49.132 region:rollup2
PALTRY SUM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

02:46:55.038 --> 02:46:58.709 region:rollup2
IN FACT WE THINK IT'S NEEDED BUT

02:46:56.673 --> 02:46:59.276 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT SHOULD BE NEEDED AND

HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN

02:49:42.072 --> 02:49:45.442 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FILLS.

02:49:43.573 --> 02:49:47.711 region:rollup2
NO THAT EQUATES TO TWENTY EIGHT

02:49:45.442 --> 02:49:49.079 region:rollup2
MILLION MILES OF GASOLINE.

02:49:47.711 --> 02:49:50.647 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ELIMINATED AND

02:49:49.079 --> 02:49:52.416 region:rollup2
REPLACED WITH ZERO EMISSION

02:49:50.647 --> 02:49:54.384 region:rollup2
VEHICLE MILES. AND THAT

02:49:52.416 --> 02:49:56.386 region:rollup2
TRANSLATES TO SEVENTEEN MILLION

02:49:54.384 --> 02:49:57.587 region:rollup2

EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY EARLY

02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:05.796 region:rollup2
STAGE IN THE MARKET SOME STRESS

02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:07.397 region:rollup2
HONOR STATIONS.

02:50:05.796 --> 02:50:09.466 region:rollup2
.

02:50:07.397 --> 02:50:10.701 region:rollup2
SO OUR OUR FIVE BUSIEST STATIONS

02:50:09.466 --> 02:50:12.636 region:rollup2
GET MAXED OUT.

02:50:10.701 --> 02:50:13.637 region:rollup2
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK TODAY.

02:50:12.636 --> 02:50:14.738 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN MULLIN ACTUALLY THE

02:50:13.637 --> 02:50:16.339 region:rollup2
STATION WE VISITED IN YOUR

02:50:14.738 --> 02:50:18.475 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS ONE OF THOSE FIVE

02:50:16.339 --> 02:50:19.843 region:rollup2
BUSIEST STATIONS SOURCING IT.

02:50:18.475 --> 02:50:21.711 region:rollup2
GET MAX NOW ON A REGULAR BASIS.

02:50:19.843 --> 02:50:23.346 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S OPEN OUR EYES TO THE

02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:25.982 region:rollup2
FACT THAT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE.

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:27.784 region:rollup2

WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE KEEP PACE

02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:32.622 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL ACHIEVE REALLY

02:50:31.455 --> 02:50:34.458 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL SCALE THAT BY TWENTY

AND THAT WE CAN BE COST

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:41.465 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE WITH GASOLINE.

02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:42.666 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW FRANK THAT I

02:50:41.465 --> 02:50:43.734 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT SINGLE LINE OF

SIGHT TO THE OFFERING FOR

02:50:43.734 --> 02:50:46.570 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT FUNDING SHOULD BE A

02:50:44.735 --> 02:50:48.038 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF ANY

02:50:46.570 --> 02:50:48.505 region:rollup2

02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.649 region:rollup2
WHERE HUSING SUPPORT OF THE

02:50:58.782 --> 02:51:01.518 region:rollup2
WORK THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

COMMISSION HAS DUG HAS DONE AND

02:51:01.518 --> 02:51:04.354 region:rollup2
IS DOING TO BUILD OUT THIS

02:51:02.586 --> 02:51:05.922 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE? AND WE BELIEVE

02:51:04.354 --> 02:51:07.390 region:rollup2
THAT WITH HALF THE MONEY IS

02:51:05.922 --> 02:51:08.992 region:rollup2
OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

EXECUTIVE ORDER TOWARDS HYDROGEN

02:51:08.992 --> 02:51:12.496 region:rollup2
WE CAN KEEP PACE AND GET THAT

02:51:11.027 --> 02:51:14.231 region:rollup2
EARLY COMMERCIAL SCALE. BY

02:51:12.496 --> 02:51:15.499 region:rollup2

OFFERING FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

02:51:15.499 --> 02:51:20.971 region:rollup2
SO WE ENCOURAGE TECHNOLOGY

02:51:16.833 --> 02:51:20.971 region:rollup2
NEUTRAL APPROACH FOR ZEV.

02:51:21.037 --> 02:51:23.373 region:rollup2
TO SEE HOW THE MONEY'S GOOD

02:51:21.938 --> 02:51:30.547 region:rollup2
HYDROGENS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:31.581 region:rollup2
OUR GOALS THANK YOU.

COMMITMENT TO THE

02:51:37.387 --> 02:51:41.258 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S A SEVERE

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:42.759 region:rollup2
DEFICIT THERE'S NO QUESTION.

02:51:41.258 --> 02:51:44.461 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE

02:51:42.759 --> 02:51:46.897 region:rollup2
DEPLOYMENT IS A VEHICLES. WE

02:51:44.461 --> 02:51:48.698 region:rollup2
STRONGLY SUPPORT INCENTIVES

02:51:46.897 --> 02:51:51.301 region:rollup2
AND AS MISTER BLOOM KNOWS WE

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:53.236 region:rollup2
HAVE STABILIZE THE HOV STICKER

02:51:51.301 --> 02:51:54.604 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE IS NOW THE TWO POINT

02:51:53.236 --> 02:51:55.906 region:rollup2
OH PROGRAM.

02:51:54.604 --> 02:51:59.075 region:rollup2
VIABLE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY

02:51:55.906 --> 02:52:00.911 region:rollup2
FIVE WE HAVE ALWAYS LAMENTED THE

02:51:59.075 --> 02:52:02.646 region:rollup2
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION FOR THE CV

02:52:00.911 --> 02:52:04.614 region:rollup2
RP WHICH HAS CARVED TESTIFIED

02:52:02.646 --> 02:52:06.383 region:rollup2
AND INTERRUPTED ON MORE THAN ONE

02:52:04.614 --> 02:52:08.351 region:rollup2
OCCASION. WE THINK IT'S A

02:52:06.383 --> 02:52:10.187 region:rollup2
CRITICAL FEATURE THE TO

02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:12.522 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES COMBINED. WILL DO

02:52:10.187 --> 02:52:15.125 region:rollup2
VERY WELL WE THINK HOV ACCESS

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:17.961 region:rollup2
AND OR THAT THE STICKER.

02:52:15.125 --> 02:52:18.929 region:rollup2
ARE AND OR THE REBATE.

02:52:17.961 --> 02:52:20.397 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME EVER WE

02:52:18.929 --> 02:52:23.099 region:rollup2
PENETRATED THE FIVE PERCENT

02:52:20.397 --> 02:52:24.167 region:rollup2
SALES ON ONE HALF OF WHICH

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:26.069 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY ALL DEFERRED A

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:27.304 region:rollup2
CARBON THIS REMAIN THE PLUG IN

02:52:26.069 --> 02:52:29.206 region:rollup2
HYBRID.

02:52:27.304 --> 02:52:30.841 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE NOT THE PURE ZERO

02:52:29.206 --> 02:52:31.875 region:rollup2
EMISSION VEHICLE THEY REMAIN THE

02:52:30.841 --> 02:52:34.144 region:rollup2
PLUG IN HYBRID.

02:52:31.875 --> 02:52:35.579 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED HYDROGEN

02:52:34.144 --> 02:52:37.180 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED

02:52:35.579 --> 02:52:39.950 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:52:37.180 --> 02:52:42.786 region:rollup2
WE NEED THE CVR P. ON AN ANNUAL

02:52:39.950 --> 02:52:45.488 region:rollup2
RELIABLE PREDICTABLE BASIS.

02:52:42.786 --> 02:52:47.490 region:rollup2
I'M ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFINEMENTS.

02:52:45.488 --> 02:52:49.125 region:rollup2
SCARE US A LITTLE.

02:52:47.490 --> 02:52:50.794 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE DONE TOO QUICKLY OR

02:52:49.125 --> 02:52:52.729 region:rollup2
TOO SEVERELY WE THINK THAT THEY

02:52:50.794 --> 02:52:54.531 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE SURGICAL. ON THEY

02:52:52.729 --> 02:52:56.266 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED TO BE LINKED.

02:52:54.531 --> 02:52:58.401 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE NOT DEPLOYING THE

02:52:56.266 --> 02:53:00.337 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ON SCHEDULE AS

02:52:58.401 --> 02:53:00.937 region:rollup2
YOU SUGGESTED MISTER MULLIN.

02:53:00.337 --> 02:53:02.205 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULDN'T BE CUT IN THE

02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:03.707 region:rollup2
REBATE.

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:05.909 region:rollup2
SO THEY HAVE TO BE DONE AND A

02:53:03.707 --> 02:53:07.410 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL WAY IN THE FUTURE BUT

02:53:05.909 --> 02:53:08.912 region:rollup2
ON BALANCE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT

02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:10.347 region:rollup2
THIS WERE WAY AHEAD OF EVERY

02:53:08.912 --> 02:53:12.382 region:rollup2
OTHER STATE IN THE NATION.

02:53:10.347 --> 02:53:15.151 region:rollup2
WE FACE HAD WINS THE LOSS OF THE

02:53:12.382 --> 02:53:16.653 region:rollup2
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IS GOING TO

02:53:15.151 --> 02:53:18.889 region:rollup2
SURFACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

02:53:16.653 --> 02:53:20.690 region:rollup2
STUBBORNLY LOW PRICING GASOLINE.

02:53:18.889 --> 02:53:22.659 region:rollup2
IS A PROBLEM.

02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:24.561 region:rollup2
BUT NOT IT ALL BUT ALL OF THIS

02:53:22.659 --> 02:53:28.431 region:rollup2
CAN BE OVERCOME I THINK WITH

02:53:24.561 --> 02:53:28.898 region:rollup2
DEDICATED REBATES HOV STICKERS

02:53:28.431 --> 02:53:36.473 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF

02:53:28.898 --> 02:53:38.241 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:53:36.473 --> 02:53:39.776 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH

02:53:38.241 --> 02:53:42.279 region:rollup2
PAWN AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA

02:53:39.776 --> 02:53:44.547 region:rollup2
REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL.

02:53:42.279 --> 02:53:46.616 region:rollup2
HEART THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF

02:53:44.547 --> 02:53:49.219 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ALREADY A.

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:51.821 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE RENEWABLE FUEL NOT

02:53:49.219 --> 02:53:54.724 region:rollup2
THAT IS TAKING OUR ORGANICS.

02:53:51.821 --> 02:53:57.227 region:rollup2
MIXING. PUTTING THEM TAKING THE

02:53:54.724 --> 02:53:58.128 region:rollup2
METHANE OUT AND THEN INJECTING

02:53:57.227 --> 02:54:00.664 region:rollup2
BACK AGAIN.

02:53:58.128 --> 02:54:02.599 region:rollup2
TO FUEL TRUCKS AND MISTER

02:54:00.664 --> 02:54:05.168 region:rollup2
MULLIN KNOWS IT'S ONE OF THE

02:54:02.599 --> 02:54:07.203 region:rollup2
THREE ARE IN HIS DISTRICT.

02:54:05.168 --> 02:54:09.239 region:rollup2
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL

02:54:07.203 --> 02:54:12.609 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD URGE YOU.

02:54:09.239 --> 02:54:13.910 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A A NET NEGATIVE

02:54:12.609 --> 02:54:15.512 region:rollup2
BELOW THE ZERO LINE.

02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:17.247 region:rollup2
.

02:54:15.512 --> 02:54:19.616 region:rollup2
FUEL

02:54:17.247 --> 02:54:21.217 region:rollup2
THIS A RENEWABLE GAS WE'D URGE

02:54:19.616 --> 02:54:22.719 region:rollup2
YEAR TO JUST TO JUST THE

02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:25.588 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A BET.

02:54:22.719 --> 02:54:27.657 region:rollup2
I PUT DEATH TWENTY FIVE THIRTY

02:54:25.588 --> 02:54:29.526 region:rollup2
MILLION AND FOR THAT TYPE OF

02:54:27.657 --> 02:54:32.095 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:54:29.526 --> 02:54:33.797 region:rollup2
AYE BECAUSE IN THIS WAY WE CAN

02:54:32.095 --> 02:54:35.765 region:rollup2
EXPAND THE WHOLE AROUND THE

02:54:33.797 --> 02:54:37.467 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:54:35.765 --> 02:54:39.602 region:rollup2
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AYE IF WE

02:54:37.467 --> 02:54:42.138 region:rollup2
WERE TO DO THIS WITH SIXTY SEVEN

02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:44.140 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE.

02:54:42.138 --> 02:54:46.876 region:rollup2
I WE WOULD BE AYE IN THE

02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:49.979 region:rollup2
CATGORY OF ONE MILLION TWO

02:54:46.876 --> 02:54:52.415 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY. THOUSAND TONS

02:54:49.979 --> 02:54:54.417 region:rollup2
OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS.

02:54:52.415 --> 02:54:56.286 region:rollup2
JUST WITH USING THIS ORGANIC

02:54:54.417 --> 02:54:57.821 region:rollup2
FRAGMENT AND AT FUELING OUR

02:54:56.286 --> 02:54:59.522 region:rollup2
TRUCKS

02:54:57.821 --> 02:55:00.256 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THREE COMPANIES

02:54:59.522 --> 02:55:02.292 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE

02:55:00.256 --> 02:55:03.727 region:rollup2
DOING THAT AYE WE'D URGENT JUST

02:55:02.292 --> 02:55:05.195 region:rollup2
TO ADJUST THE BUDGET REFLECT

02:55:03.727 --> 02:55:07.497 region:rollup2
PROPERLY.

02:55:05.195 --> 02:55:08.865 region:rollup2
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS

02:55:07.497 --> 02:55:11.201 region:rollup2
BEGINNING TO BLOSSOM

02:55:08.865 --> 02:55:11.801 region:rollup2
AND EXPANDED.

02:55:11.201 --> 02:55:17.640 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

FOR SO I WANT TO SAY THE TOYOTA

02:55:31.121 --> 02:55:33.656 region:rollup2
BELIEVES IN THE ZERO EMISSION

02:55:32.355 --> 02:55:35.191 region:rollup2
FUTURE AND IS WORKING HARD TO

02:55:33.656 --> 02:55:36.192 region:rollup2
BRING PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET.

02:55:35.191 --> 02:55:37.827 region:rollup2
YET THE MARIAH FUEL CELL

02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:39.295 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLE. AND THE PLUG

02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:40.830 region:rollup2
INTO A.

VEHICLE THE PREVIOUS PRIME IN

02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:44.467 region:rollup2
THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. THIS

02:55:42.165 --> 02:55:46.469 region:rollup2
TRANSITION IS AS DIFFICULT AS WE

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:47.737 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW AND. DOES REQUIRE SOME

02:55:46.469 --> 02:55:49.739 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THESE

02:55:47.737 --> 02:55:51.441 region:rollup2
EARLY TRANSITION YEARS.

02:55:49.739 --> 02:55:52.709 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID DOT TOYOTA.

HUNDRED STATION TARGET.

02:56:06.756 --> 02:56:09.359 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MINIMUM

02:56:07.824 --> 02:56:10.660 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF STATIONS NEEDED TO

02:56:09.359 --> 02:56:11.628 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE NUMBER OF FUEL CELL

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:13.563 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES EXPECTED IN

02:56:11.628 --> 02:56:14.898 region:rollup2
THE MARKET.

02:56:13.563 --> 02:56:16.499 region:rollup2
BOB I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE

02:56:14.898 --> 02:56:18.034 region:rollup2
COMMENT ALSO REGARDING FUEL CELL

02:56:16.499 --> 02:56:19.836 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR SOME

02:56:18.034 --> 02:56:20.904 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ON THE DIFFICULTY.

02:56:19.836 --> 02:56:22.539 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN MULTI UNIT

02:56:20.904 --> 02:56:24.641 region:rollup2
WELLINGS AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

02:56:22.539 --> 02:56:26.342 region:rollup2
VEHICLES ARE A GREAT OPTION FOR

02:56:24.641 --> 02:56:28.077 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU FEEL.

02:56:26.342 --> 02:56:29.479 region:rollup2
AT STATIONS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:30.947 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE A CONVENTIONAL

02:56:29.479 --> 02:56:32.782 region:rollup2
GASOLINE ELECTRIC VEHICLES A GAS

02:56:30.947 --> 02:56:33.917 region:rollup2
GUZZLING VEHICLE.

02:56:32.782 --> 02:56:35.485 region:rollup2
JUST A COMMENT OR TWO ON THE

02:56:33.917 --> 02:56:36.886 region:rollup2
STATION FUNDING PROCESS WE LOOK

02:56:35.485 --> 02:56:38.855 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH

02:56:36.886 --> 02:56:40.590 region:rollup2
THE CC.

02:56:38.855 --> 02:56:42.225 region:rollup2
THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON THIS OF

02:56:40.590 --> 02:56:43.827 region:rollup2
WE HOPE AT ONE WORK WITH THEM TO

02:56:42.225 --> 02:56:45.028 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THE FEW THE FUNDS ARE

02:56:43.827 --> 02:56:46.396 region:rollup2
DISPERSED IN A WAY.

02:56:45.028 --> 02:56:48.631 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

02:56:46.396 --> 02:56:49.666 region:rollup2
OF STATION NETWORKS.

02:56:48.631 --> 02:56:51.134 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CREATE ECONOMIES OF

02:56:49.666 --> 02:56:52.402 region:rollup2
SCALES AND SPUR FASTER MORE

02:56:51.134 --> 02:56:54.504 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:56:52.402 --> 02:56:56.072 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE STATE.

02:56:54.504 --> 02:56:58.074 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:59.409 region:rollup2
THE STATIONS SHOULD BE AWARDED A

APPROPRIATELY IN THE AREA

03:15:19.007 --> 03:15:22.377 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE PLAN SO I'D LOOK FOR

03:15:20.876 --> 03:15:23.645 region:rollup2

YEAR SPENDING PLAN AS WELL AS

03:15:55.077 --> 03:15:58.413 region:rollup2
THIS ONE ZERO ABLE TO COME TO

03:15:56.411 --> 03:16:00.215 region:rollup2
COMPARE HOW THE TWO. ARE ALIKE

03:15:58.413 --> 03:16:01.149 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT I ALSO INCLUDES

03:16:00.215 --> 03:16:02.751 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE CONTINUOUS

03:16:01.149 --> 03:16:04.653 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS WHICH ROLE ARE

03:16:02.751 --> 03:16:05.787 region:rollup2
STILL ON GOING AS WELL AS A

03:16:04.653 --> 03:16:06.488 region:rollup2
LAYING OUT SOME OF THE EXISTING

03:16:05.787 --> 03:16:08.457 region:rollup2
COMMITMENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED

03:16:06.488 --> 03:16:10.092 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION THAT WERE MADE AND

03:16:08.457 --> 03:16:11.827 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION

03:16:10.092 --> 03:16:13.395 region:rollup2
SO. OVERALL THE ENTIRE PACKAGE

03:16:11.827 --> 03:16:14.630 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT OUT TWO POINT EIGHT

03:16:13.395 --> 03:16:17.032 region:rollup2
BILLION SORT OF UNDER THE

03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:18.400 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE

03:16:17.032 --> 03:16:19.001 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS SO.

03:16:18.400 --> 03:16:21.570 region:rollup2
JUST ONE INTO A KIND OF.

03:16:19.001 --> 03:16:23.972 region:rollup2
SET THE STAGE THERE ARE MOVING

03:16:21.570 --> 03:16:25.474 region:rollup2
JUST DISCRETIONARY PIECE AND I

03:16:23.972 --> 03:16:27.843 region:rollup2
THINK OVERALL IT OUR VIEW IS

03:16:25.474 --> 03:16:28.043 region:rollup2
THAT THE. PLAN FINDS A LOT OF

03:16:27.843 --> 03:16:29.578 region:rollup2
THE.

03:16:28.043 --> 03:16:30.679 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROGRAMS THAT WERE

03:16:29.578 --> 03:16:32.447 region:rollup2
FUNDED AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S

03:16:30.679 --> 03:16:32.881 region:rollup2
PLANS WAS VERY SIMILAR IN A LOT

03:16:32.447 --> 03:16:34.049 region:rollup2
OF WAYS.

03:16:32.881 --> 03:16:35.117 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES

MULTI YEAR FUNDING SO INSTEAD

03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:21.797 region:rollup2
OF JUST THE ONE YEAR FUNDING

03:17:19.995 --> 03:17:23.365 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS BEEN TYPICAL AS PART

03:17:21.797 --> 03:17:23.865 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM. ABOUT TWENTY

FUNDING AND SO. I JUST LOOKING

03:17:33.575 --> 03:17:36.645 region:rollup2
AT THE OUT YEARS A OF SPENDING

03:17:35.444 --> 03:17:37.946 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ASSUME THAT OF THE

03:17:36.645 --> 03:17:39.548 region:rollup2
REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE

03:17:37.946 --> 03:17:42.084 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR HAS ASSUMES CONTINUE

OF ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION.

03:17:42.751 --> 03:17:46.221 region:rollup2
THE COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:17:44.353 --> 03:17:48.023 region:rollup2
MADE SO FAR ALREADY AND IF THIS.

03:17:46.221 --> 03:17:49.558 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ADOPTED WOULD TOTAL

03:17:48.023 --> 03:17:50.192 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ON

03:17:49.558 --> 03:17:53.362 region:rollup2
KIND OF AND.

03:17:50.192 --> 03:17:54.262 region:rollup2
ON ANNUAL BASIS AND SO EIGHT

03:17:53.362 --> 03:17:55.297 region:rollup2

03:17:55.297 --> 03:17:58.900 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW IF IF REVENUES ARE

03:17:57.499 --> 03:18:00.502 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:02.270 region:rollup2
THAT LEAVES ABOUT YOU KNOW SIX

03:18:00.502 --> 03:18:03.705 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION OR SO AND OF ON

03:18:02.270 --> 03:18:05.607 region:rollup2
GOING FOR THESE OTHER TYPES OF

03:18:03.705 --> 03:18:06.174 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

03:18:05.607 --> 03:18:07.376 region:rollup2
BEEN FUN IN THE PAST SO THAT

03:18:06.174 --> 03:18:08.143 region:rollup2
JUST.

03:18:07.376 --> 03:18:09.478 region:rollup2
I THINK SOME IMPORTANT PEOPLE

03:18:08.143 --> 03:18:10.645 region:rollup2
MIND THROUGH THE LONG RUN WHAT

03:18:09.478 --> 03:18:12.881 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COMMITTING TO WONDER.

03:18:10.645 --> 03:18:13.448 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WHAT YOU

03:18:12.881 --> 03:18:14.516 region:rollup2
WOULD BE COMMITTING TO UNDER

03:18:13.448 --> 03:18:16.351 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL.

03:18:14.516 --> 03:18:17.786 region:rollup2
SO OUR OUR GENERAL

03:18:16.351 --> 03:18:19.421 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS OUR FIRST JUST

03:18:17.786 --> 03:18:20.188 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS

03:18:19.421 --> 03:18:20.956 region:rollup2
ARE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR

03:18:20.188 --> 03:18:22.390 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES ARE NOT THE

03:18:20.956 --> 03:18:23.425 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS A VARIETY OF

03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:24.760 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES WHEN THINKING ABOUT

03:18:23.425 --> 03:18:26.194 region:rollup2
THE. FUNDING PLAN BOTH

03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:27.696 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL

03:18:26.194 --> 03:18:30.232 region:rollup2
AS LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS CLIMATE

03:18:27.696 --> 03:18:31.133 region:rollup2
ADAPTATION OTHER THINGS SO JUST.

03:18:30.232 --> 03:18:32.567 region:rollup2
I'M SURE THAT KIND OF THIS

03:18:31.133 --> 03:18:33.802 region:rollup2
PACKAGE KIND OF AND MEETS THOSE

03:18:32.567 --> 03:18:35.170 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AND FITS.

03:18:33.802 --> 03:18:37.205 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE PRIORITIES.

03:18:35.170 --> 03:18:38.507 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS

03:18:37.205 --> 03:18:41.610 region:rollup2
AS THE OUT YEAR WHICH I TALKED

03:18:38.507 --> 03:18:43.078 region:rollup2
ABOUT JUST A MINUTE AGO.

03:18:41.610 --> 03:18:44.613 region:rollup2
HOW ARE AND KIND OF IN ORDER TO

03:18:43.078 --> 03:18:45.714 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THAT JUST BASED ON WHAT

03:18:44.613 --> 03:18:46.948 region:rollup2
THOSE PRIORITIES R. WE THINK

03:18:45.714 --> 03:18:47.716 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOR THE

03:18:46.948 --> 03:18:48.917 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THAT GOOD

03:18:47.716 --> 03:18:50.152 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THESE

03:18:48.917 --> 03:18:51.386 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE ACCOMPLISHING AND

03:18:50.152 --> 03:18:52.654 region:rollup2
WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE?

03:18:51.386 --> 03:18:54.923 region:rollup2
MISTER ONLY MENTIONED THEIR

03:18:52.654 --> 03:18:57.058 region:rollup2
RECENTLY RELEASED ANNUAL REPORT.

03:18:54.923 --> 03:18:58.160 region:rollup2
THAT TRIES ESTIMATES SOME OF

03:18:57.058 --> 03:18:59.694 region:rollup2
THE GHG OUTCOMES

03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:01.196 region:rollup2
I'LL ONE THING THAT WE HAVE A

03:18:59.694 --> 03:19:02.164 region:rollup2
NOTED JUST GIVEN SOME OF THE

03:19:01.196 --> 03:19:02.731 region:rollup2
INTEREST IN A LOT OF THESE

03:19:02.164 --> 03:19:04.032 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

03:19:02.731 --> 03:19:05.767 region:rollup2
THAT REPORT STILL DOESN'T

03:19:04.032 --> 03:19:07.435 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES THAT CO BENEFITS

03:19:05.767 --> 03:19:08.637 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE A REDUCTIONS IN

03:19:07.435 --> 03:19:09.971 region:rollup2
LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS

03:19:08.637 --> 03:19:10.972 region:rollup2
OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS

03:19:09.971 --> 03:19:12.741 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CLIMATE

03:19:10.972 --> 03:19:14.342 region:rollup2
ADAPTATION OR WATER OR OTHER

03:19:12.741 --> 03:19:15.544 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT. I KNOW THE

03:19:14.342 --> 03:19:16.444 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

03:19:15.544 --> 03:19:18.079 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CONTINUING TO COME TO

03:19:16.444 --> 03:19:19.815 region:rollup2
WORK ON THAT BUT THAT'S AN AREA

03:19:18.079 --> 03:19:20.882 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU MIGHT WANNA ASK THE

03:19:19.815 --> 03:19:21.950 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO.

03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:23.018 region:rollup2
COMMENT ON ITS PROGRESS

03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:25.387 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IN THOSE THINGS

03:19:23.018 --> 03:19:25.787 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC BETTER SENSE OF WHAT.

03:19:25.387 --> 03:19:26.588 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS ARE

03:19:25.787 --> 03:19:28.223 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHING.

03:19:26.588 --> 03:19:29.958 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY.

03:19:28.223 --> 03:19:31.726 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

03:19:29.958 --> 03:19:34.563 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ITS OPTIONS FOR

03:19:31.726 --> 03:19:36.031 region:rollup2
ENSURING FUND'S SOLVENCY SO SOME

03:19:34.563 --> 03:19:37.432 region:rollup2
OF THE NUMBERS HERE OF THE

03:19:36.031 --> 03:19:39.201 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING TWO

03:19:37.432 --> 03:19:40.702 region:rollup2
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

03:19:39.201 --> 03:19:42.871 region:rollup2
REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TWO

03:19:40.702 --> 03:19:43.839 region:rollup2
POINT FOUR BILLION IN THE BUDGET

03:19:42.871 --> 03:19:45.841 region:rollup2
YEAR.

03:19:43.839 --> 03:19:46.708 region:rollup2
AND UNDER THE SPENDING PLAN IT

03:19:45.841 --> 03:19:48.210 region:rollup2
WOULD SPEND.

03:19:46.708 --> 03:19:49.911 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF THE AVAILABLE

03:19:48.210 --> 03:19:51.179 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IF THAT'S THE REVENUE

03:19:49.911 --> 03:19:53.281 region:rollup2
THAT COMES AND LEAVING ARE A

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:54.916 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SMALL FUND BALANCE.

03:19:53.281 --> 03:19:56.184 region:rollup2
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN THE

03:19:54.916 --> 03:19:57.486 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY IN REVENUE IN THE

03:19:56.184 --> 03:19:58.453 region:rollup2
PAST WE THINK.

03:19:57.486 --> 03:19:59.721 region:rollup2
IS REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE

03:19:58.453 --> 03:20:01.089 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AND ACTUALLY WE THINK

03:19:59.721 --> 03:20:02.324 region:rollup2
REVENUE IS LIKELY TO BE A LITTLE

03:20:01.089 --> 03:20:03.291 region:rollup2
BIT HIGHER THAN THIS BUT GIVEN

03:20:02.324 --> 03:20:03.859 region:rollup2
THE VOLATILITY THERE'S QUITE A

03:20:03.291 --> 03:20:05.160 region:rollup2
BIT OF.

03:20:03.859 --> 03:20:06.995 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY

03:20:05.160 --> 03:20:08.196 region:rollup2
AROUND REVENUE AND SOME CHANCE

03:20:06.995 --> 03:20:09.497 region:rollup2
THAT REVENUE COULD COME IN A

03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:10.899 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN.

03:20:09.497 --> 03:20:11.833 region:rollup2
EXPECTED SO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

03:20:10.899 --> 03:20:12.868 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THAT THE

03:20:11.833 --> 03:20:15.170 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION WE THINK IT'S

03:20:12.868 --> 03:20:16.338 region:rollup2
BEFORE TO A REASONABLE PROPOSAL

03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:17.639 region:rollup2
FOR MOST OF THE PROGRAMS OF

03:20:16.338 --> 03:20:18.773 region:rollup2
REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THERE

03:20:17.639 --> 03:20:20.275 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A OF PROPORTIONAL

03:20:18.773 --> 03:20:21.376 region:rollup2
REDUCTION AND SOME OF THE

03:20:20.275 --> 03:20:22.811 region:rollup2
ALLOCATIONS.

03:20:21.376 --> 03:20:24.813 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE.

03:20:22.811 --> 03:20:27.082 region:rollup2
WITH A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS.

03:20:24.813 --> 03:20:28.550 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OPERATED THROUGH CAL

03:20:27.082 --> 03:20:30.352 region:rollup2
FIRE THE HEALTHY FOREST PROGRAM

03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:31.486 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE AIR RESOURCES

03:20:30.352 --> 03:20:32.921 region:rollup2
BOARD PROGRAMS WOULD BE MADE

03:20:31.486 --> 03:20:34.289 region:rollup2
WHOLE WOULD BE KEPT HOLE IN THE

03:20:32.921 --> 03:20:35.824 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS WOULD BE REDUCED

03:20:34.289 --> 03:20:37.025 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONATELY SO. AGAIN I

03:20:35.824 --> 03:20:37.959 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S JUST AN AREA WE

03:20:37.025 --> 03:20:39.160 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU

03:20:37.959 --> 03:20:40.962 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FEAT THAT'S A. AN

03:20:39.160 --> 03:20:41.496 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF THIS PLAN THAT THE

03:20:40.962 --> 03:20:43.331 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:45.367 region:rollup2
CONSIDER. WHETHER OR NOT NIKADA

03:20:43.331 --> 03:20:46.868 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING THOSE PROGRAMS IN

03:20:45.367 --> 03:20:47.903 region:rollup2
AND IN IN A SCENARIO WHERE

03:20:46.868 --> 03:20:49.638 region:rollup2
REVENUE COMES IN LOWER IS

03:20:47.903 --> 03:20:50.605 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE

03:20:49.638 --> 03:20:51.740 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES THOSE

03:20:50.605 --> 03:20:54.175 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE OTHER

03:20:51.740 --> 03:20:54.509 region:rollup2
ONES THAT WERE NOT A PART OF

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:55.777 region:rollup2
THIS PACKAGE.

03:20:54.509 --> 03:20:57.345 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

03:20:55.777 --> 03:20:58.513 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD.

03:20:57.345 --> 03:20:59.481 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I

03:20:58.513 --> 03:21:01.383 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF YOU

03:20:59.481 --> 03:21:02.851 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE.

03:21:01.383 --> 03:21:05.053 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIONS REVENUE.

03:21:02.851 --> 03:21:06.621 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS ARE REASONABLE EVEN

03:21:05.053 --> 03:21:08.490 region:rollup2
THOUGH THE.

03:21:06.621 --> 03:21:09.057 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT AUCTIONS HAVE BEEN A

03:21:08.490 --> 03:21:10.725 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE A LITTLE ROSIER

03:21:09.057 --> 03:21:13.662 region:rollup2
THAN.

03:21:10.725 --> 03:21:14.129 region:rollup2
THAN ORIGINALLY PROJECTED AND

03:21:13.662 --> 03:21:15.463 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE OF SOME

03:21:14.129 --> 03:21:17.499 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY. AND THE.

03:21:15.463 --> 03:21:18.733 region:rollup2
OUT YEARS THAT'S RIGHT YEAH I

03:21:17.499 --> 03:21:20.535 region:rollup2
MEAN WE WE THINK THEY'RE KIND OF

03:21:18.733 --> 03:21:22.070 region:rollup2
REASONABLE GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY

03:21:20.535 --> 03:21:24.105 region:rollup2
AROUND WHAT REVENUES CAN BE AND

03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:25.206 region:rollup2
I THINK OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS

03:21:24.105 --> 03:21:27.208 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WROTE THERE ARE LIKELY

03:21:25.206 --> 03:21:27.842 region:rollup2
TO BE ALL OF THE HIGHER A FEW

03:21:27.208 --> 03:21:29.144 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER

03:21:27.842 --> 03:21:30.979 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS

03:21:29.144 --> 03:21:32.948 region:rollup2
PROPOSING BUT AGAIN YET GIVEN

03:21:30.979 --> 03:21:33.448 region:rollup2
THAT VOLATILITY WOULD YOU THINK

03:21:32.948 --> 03:21:34.749 region:rollup2
THEY'RE KIND OF WITHIN A

03:21:33.448 --> 03:21:37.619 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RANGE.

03:21:34.749 --> 03:21:38.153 region:rollup2
IN THE A QUESTIONS.

03:21:37.619 --> 03:21:43.124 region:rollup2

03:21:38.153 --> 03:21:45.327 region:rollup2

FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE.

03:34:08.436 --> 03:34:13.507 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM REDUCES ENERGY

03:34:10.638 --> 03:34:15.276 region:rollup2
BILLS ANTS EMISSIONS AND ALSO

03:34:13.507 --> 03:34:17.578 region:rollup2
CREATES JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

03:34:15.276 --> 03:34:19.180 region:rollup2
WE ALSO A DISAGREE WITH THIS

03:34:21.582 --> 03:34:25.019 region:rollup2
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE

03:34:23.417 --> 03:34:26.587 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE FILLED BY PROP SIXTY

03:34:25.019 --> 03:34:28.089 region:rollup2

COMMUNITIES A VERY INNOVATIVE

03:34:43.070 --> 03:34:47.074 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO INTEGRATE

03:34:45.272 --> 03:34:47.675 region:rollup2
VARIOUS CLIMB INVESTMENTS TO

AYE WE DO.

03:35:01.555 --> 03:35:04.859 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE

03:35:02.723 --> 03:35:05.893 region:rollup2
MORE MONEY ADDED TO THE LOW

03:35:04.859 --> 03:35:07.728 region:rollup2

ITEM WITH WITH THAT THE GGF

03:35:07.728 --> 03:35:11.766 region:rollup2
PLAN. OUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT

03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:13.968 region:rollup2
IT'S SO FAR IS UNBALANCED

03:35:11.766 --> 03:35:15.336 region:rollup2
AND THAT A SHORT TERM AND LONG

03:35:13.968 --> 03:35:17.338 region:rollup2
TERM STRATEGY SHOULD BE

03:35:15.336 --> 03:35:18.839 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED. A LOT OF MONEY

03:35:17.338 --> 03:35:19.907 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS GOING TOWARD SAYS

03:35:18.839 --> 03:35:21.542 region:rollup2
REMISSION VEHICLES MEDIUM AND

03:35:19.907 --> 03:35:23.944 region:rollup2
HEAVY DUTY.

03:35:21.542 --> 03:35:24.945 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS GONNA TAKE UP TO. A

03:35:23.944 --> 03:35:26.881 region:rollup2
LONG TIME AT THE TEN YEARS

03:35:24.945 --> 03:35:28.349 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY OR MORE TO REALLY GET

03:35:26.881 --> 03:35:28.983 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RANGE

03:35:28.349 --> 03:35:31.852 region:rollup2
AND.

03:35:28.983 --> 03:35:33.454 region:rollup2
THE TECHNOLOGY UP TO SPEED AYE

03:35:31.852 --> 03:35:35.556 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LOOK

03:35:33.454 --> 03:35:37.224 region:rollup2
AT AN URGENT REDUCTION AND COST

03:35:35.556 --> 03:35:38.058 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE REDUCTION FOR

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND
