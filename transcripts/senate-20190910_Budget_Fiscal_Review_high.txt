PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES MADAM SECRETARY NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF A QUORUM IS MEMBERS CONTINUE TO JOIN US THANK YOU SO MUCH WELCOME TO TODAY'S SENATE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE HEARING BEFORE WE GET STARTED I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE PULLING AB ONE SEVENTEEN FROM TODAY'S A GENDER WE EXPECT TO HEAR IT LATER IN THE WEEK. THAT LEAVES US WITH EIGHT BILLS WILL BE HEARING TODAY A BUDGET BILL JUNIOR AND SEVEN BUDGET TRAILER BILLS AB ONE OH NINE ALSO KNOWN AS BUDGET BILL JUNIOR IS OUR TYPICAL CLEAN UP TO THE BUDGET COLLEAGUES HOWEVER I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT IT ALSO INCLUDES A HANDFUL OF NEW APPROPRIATIONS THAT WERE EITHER PART OF THE JUNE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS OR HAVE BEEN RECENTLY NEGOTIATED WITH. THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MORNING AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BEFORE YOU GET STARTED LET ME JUST ALSO CLARIFY. THE NEXT SEE. THIS BUDGET BILL JUNIORTAKES THREE BASIC APPROACHES FIRST IT MAKES AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED TECHNICAL SUGGESTION TECHNICAL UPDATES AND A FOLLOW UP TO THE THREE PARTY AGREEMENT THAT WAS REACHED IN JUNE AS WELL AS A SMALL NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATIONS THAT FOLLOW ON FROM THAT AGREEMENT THE SECOND THING THAT IS IT DOES IS A REFLECTS ANY CHANGES AND SHIFTS IN FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT IT DOES IS IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILLS AS PART OF THAT BUT YOU DON'T CLEAN UP PROCESS. SO THEIR NUMBER OF TECHNICAL ELEMENTS IN THE BILL BUT I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MORE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS FIRST FOR THE CALVET PROGRAM THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT WE AT THE GOVERNMENT INCREASED FUNDING FROM NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT IS NOW THE CURRENT YEAR THIS WOULD RAISE THE CAP ON THE SIZE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL GRANT FROM HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IT ALSO INCLUDES YOUR PREPARATION OF TWO HUNDRED SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS FUNDING FOR SONGS SALTON SEA HABITAT RESTORATION MUCH OF THAT REVERTED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR APPROPRIATIONS THIS WILL ENABLE AN EARLIER START TO THAT PROJECT AS MENTIONED WITH REGARD TO FEDERAL FUNDS CHANGES WITH REGARD TO THE MIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE MCKINNEY VENTO HOMELESS CHILDREN COLLEGE EDUCATION PROGRAM AS WELL AS CHEFS AND AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CAL WORKS AND FINALLY AND NOT HAVE CITY AND- AROUND SAYS THE CHAIR MENTIONED SMALL APPROPRIATIONS AND BEYOND THAT RE APPROPRIATIONS OF FUNDING THAT WAS NOT EXPENDED IN PRIOR YEARS. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THESE ELEMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS. ON AB ONE OH NINE BUDGET BILL JUNIOR. KABIR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A REAL QUICK QUESTION THE COPY I P. I GUESS I MISSED THAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE INCREASE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IN THE CAL VIP PROGRAM IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT'S SET UP AND THIS IS REALLY TO REDUCE GANG VIOLENCE IN IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES MANY RURAL ISOLATED COMMUNITIES HAVE THE SAME GAME VIOLENCE ISSUE THAT THE BIG CITIES DO AND SO WE DID A CARVE OUT FOR COMMUNITIES OF LESSEN FORD FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FORTY THOUSAND INHABITANTS. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET RESOURCES INTO SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IF YOU MAKE THE GRANTS TO BIG THEN THERE'S LESS MONEY TO GO AROUND AND MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES DON'T REALLY NEED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN A GRANT THEY JUST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE SO I I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THAT I MEAN A MY CONCERN IS IT GOES UP TO MOST OF THE BIG CITIES AND IN THE PAST THAT'S BEEN FINE WITH ME BECAUSE SALINAS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BIG CITIES BUT I NOW HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CITIES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN THAT AND SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT PLEASE MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS AND ALSO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE AND THE FIRST IS THAT I YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THAT WAS ONE REASON WHILE THE CAP IS INCREASED. WE DID NOT SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO JUST REMOVING CAP ALTOGETHER AND FOR EXACT CONCERNS THAT YOU MENTIONED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A CAP THAT IS MEANINGFUL THE SECOND POINT IS THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF A THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAMS RATHER THAN A NINE MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAMS WE THOUGHT THAT IT PRISON THE CAP IS NOT GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO THE BIG CITIES WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING RESOURCES FOR STATE FOR PROGRAMS IN ALL DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE AND THEN THE THIRD POINT I WOULD MENTION IS FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS TO REALLY GAUGE THE- EFFECTIVENESS SO HAVING THIS LARGER AMOUNT BUT SPREAD OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. MIGHT ENABLE US TO DO THAT. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MISTER EDWARDS. ERIN EDWARDS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO JUST WHAT AT TWO OF MY COLLEAGUE SAID BY NOTING THAT. I THINK IN THE PAST THE BORDERS STAY IN COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING THESE GROUNDS. HAS THEY'VE NOTED THAT THE THERE HAVE BEEN A RELUCTANCE ON ON THE PART OF SOME. WELL HOW IT IS TO APPLY FOR THE FOR THESE GRANTS BECAUSE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS ON REPORTING ON THESE GRANTS. I THINK IT HAS DISSUADED SOME SOME LOCALS FROM FROM APPLYING I THINK. THEIR ANTICIPATION IS THAT BY RAISING THAT CAP TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION IS GOING TO OPEN UP. APPLICATION STATE TO CUT. LOCALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO APPLY IN THE PAST. YEAH YES I GUESS I BACK I JUST WANT TO PUT IS A FOOTNOTE TO THAT I APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION THANK YOU. IS THAT IT'S NOT THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RELUCTANT TO APPLY IT IT'S A BIGGER CITIES WHO HAVE MORE RESOURCES AND THEY LOOK AT IT AND THEY SAY WE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO DEAL WITH THIS SO. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE STATE GRANT PROCESS SO I I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND TELL YOU THAT THIS IS. I THINK A REAL IMPORTANT RESOURCE. THAT HAS BEEN UNAVAILABLE TO SMALLER COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE GRANT AND THEN TO FOLLOW THROUGH. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COMPETE BASED ON THAT THAT ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HI VIOLENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY IF YOU THEY DO BUT IN COMPARISON TO THE BIG CITIES THEY CAN'T MAKE IT SO. THAT'S WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT FALL CONVERSATION HAPPEN. TO BE A C. C. AS WELL. YES THE SHEET THAT. THANK YOU IN FOR THE QUESTIONS. THE NON PUBLIC COMMENT ON AB ONE OH NINE.

LEYVA AYE MCGUIRE. WHERE I AM MONEY MONEY NINE MORE LAW. PAN I ROTH ROTH AYE SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE STERN TERN AYE STONE AMBER. AMBER GUYS WHY BECAUSE HE WHY BECAUSE THE AYE. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. THANK YOU WILL BE ON COLLEAGUES TO AB. AB ONE TWELVE IS THE TRAILER BILL ON STATE IN GENERAL GOVERNMENT AND HAS A COUPLE OF KEY PROVISIONS THE FIRST RELATES TO THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION THIS WAS AN OFFICE THAT WAS CREATED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THIS BILL BASICALLY TAKES STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA PROVIDED TO THAT OFFICE REMAINS CONFIDENTIAL AND ALSO REQUIRES REPORTING FROM THAT OFFICE TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SECOND WITH REGARD TO THE CAL SAVERS PROGRAM FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE SECURE CHOICE PROGRAM THIS ELIMINATES WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE GAME LOS ACCOUNT WHICH WAS USED FOR SMOOTHING AND THAT ACCOUNT IS NOT BEING USED BY THE PROGRAM IN ANY CASE SO THIS BASICALLY TEXT EDITORIAL WAY. THIRD THING THAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT CLARIFIES THE USE OF THE PDSA THAT'S THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT IT ALSO MAKES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CHANGES BUT FINALLY THREE SUBSTANTIVE AREAS THAT YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. FIRST IS THAT CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW WITH REGARD TO EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION BY EMPLOYERS SECOND IS AN AGREEMENT ON A VEHICLE EXHAUST IN TERMS OF NOISE STANDARDS WITH REGARD TO CARS VERSUS MOTORCYCLES AND WE KNOW THAT'S BEEN UP FOR A PRODUCT OF A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AMONGST MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN THE THIRD IS WITH REGARD TO THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THIS ENABLES DISCRETIONARY SIERRA AUDITING VIEWS OF CDC ARE WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE OR THE GOVERNOR AND TAKES A THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM A PRIOR BILL AND CLARIFIES HOW CAN BE USED TWENTY ONE POSITIONS AND I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST POINT ON THIS WHICH IS THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ON PEACE OFFICER STATUS. WITHIN THIS OFFICE THAT'S A CONVERSATION THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE. MONTHS AND ONE OF REACH SOME TYPE OF RESOLUTION ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HOPE TO REACH RESOLUTION THAT'LL CENTER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT. COMMENT ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND A THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL BEFORE US DOES HAVE THE LANGUAGE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AROUND THE AUDITS AND SUCH AND WHICH IS GREAT NOW THE ISSUE THAT YOU REFERENCED WHICH I APPRECIATE ALSO THAT THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY AROUND THE PEACE OFFICER STATUS. I JUST WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE CONTEXT BECAUSE EVEN EVEN I WHO VOTED IN TWENTY ELEVEN TO ELIMINATE PEACE OFFICERS FROM THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL I THINK. DIDN'T FULLY APPRECIATE HOW. WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT ACTION WOULD BE IN TERMS OF THAT OFFICE BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE TYPE OF INVESTIGATORY AUTHORITY THAT WHENWE LOOK AT THE ESTABLISHMENT THE LEGISLATURE'S ESTABLISHMENT OF THAT OFFICE IN WHAT THE PURPOSE WAS IT WAS TO HAVE. WITHIN OUR LARGEST STATE DEPARTMENT WITH THE LARGEST NUMBER OF STATE EMPLOYEES TO HAVE A SEMI INDEPENDENT I SAY SEMI BECAUSE IT'S STILL A STATE AGENCY. ENTITY THAT COULD. INVOLVE ITSELF OVERSEE COMPLAINTS AND SUCH AND INVOLVE ITSELF IN THAT PROCESS TO A DEGREE NOW WE'VE PUT BELTS AND SUSPENDERS ON HOW THAT OFFICE CAN BE INVOLVED IN SUCH INVESTIGATIONS WHICH I APPRECIATE AND DON'T WANT NECESSARILY FOR US TO UNDO. THE REMAINING ISSUE AROUND THE LACK OF A PEACE OFFICER WITH IN THAT UNIT IS THAT IT. IT PUTS THE UNIT IN A POSITION WHERE IT CANNOT HANDLE OR PROCESS EVIDENCE BECAUSE OUR CODES REQUIRED THE US PEACE OFFICER STATUS TO DO SO. AND THUS IF THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION WHERE. WHERE SUCH EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT IT ALSO CANNOT OF. PROCESS SEND THAT EVIDENCE TO SAY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR ANY TYPE OF PROCESSING SO YET CHAIN OF CUSTODY YES THANK YOU ARE NOT BEING A LAWYER I DON'T KNOW ALL THE TERMS ANYWAY SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT FROM I THINK OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES POINT OF VIEW WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN OUR DISCUSSIONS IS THAT. WE AS A LEGISLATURE APPROVED A BUDGET THAT HAD THREE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE OFFICE WHICH IS GREAT AND IS REFLECTED HERE AND I THINK IN THE INTERIM DISCUSSIONS AS TO HOW THAT WOULD BE ALLOCATED IT WAS VIEWED THAT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PEACE OFFICER WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS OVER AND ABOVE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE DIDN'T REALLY FACTOR IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE EXISTING STAFF WITH IN THAT UNIT WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SWORN PEACE OFFICERS SO THAT WE MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE ONE FOR EXAMPLE. AT A MUCH LOWER COST AND WITHOUT HAVING TO CREATE A NEW POSITION AND THAT'S CERTAINLY I THINK WHAT PART OF WHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THAT APPRECIATE THAT THE DISCUSSION. OF EIGHT AND HOPE THAT WE CAN TO RESOLUTION. HERE HERE THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I CASKEY LET ME BE MORE FRANK INTERACT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY ST THIS CAN BE FIXED MINISTRY TO PLAY WE SHOULDN'T BE HARBORING BAD ACT ACTIVITY IN BAD ACTIONS THEY'RE GOING ON IN OUR IN OUR STATE PRISONS WE EXPECT AS AT LEAST I AS A MEMBER THIS BUT BUDGET COMMITTEE EXPECT THE MINISTRATION TO FIX IT.

MADAM CHAIR MY CAR WITH WESTERN CENTER LAW POVERTY WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE TO A RESTORE WHEN SOMEONE HAS A LOUD MUFFLER TO GET A FIX THE TICKET RATHER THAN A TICKET WHICH IS A BURDEN ON OUR CLIENTS IN SOMETHING WE ARE HOPE WOULD GET FIX THIS YEAR WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE IT.

NUMBER NINE WHITE HUSKY BECAUSE THE AYE YES NO. TENER NIELSEN YES TO KNOW DIDN'T VOTE LEE WAS NON VOTING TO NOW SO IT'S ENOUGH. WELL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN I THINK WE STILL HAVE SOME OF THE MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN JOINED IS MOVING ON TO ITEM THREE ON THE AGENDA A. B. THIRTEEN HOUSING. FINANCE. AB ONE THIRTEEN IS THE HOUSING. AB ONE THIRTEEN IS THE HOUSING TRAILER BILL TWO MAJOR ELEMENTS HERE FIRST THIS REGARD TODAY NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT SO THIS WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE COURT TO BE RE APPROPRIATED FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES SO THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO CREATE A PERMANENT TRUST WITH THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ASSIST PEOPLE WHO ARE. IN DANGER OF FORECLOSURE HELPING PREVENT FORECLOSURES AS WELL AS HELPING RENTERS AND RENTER AN EVICTION PROTECTION RELATED MATTERS SO THIS WOULD BE AN ON GOING UP PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THESE MATTERS THE BILL INCLUDES A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PREPARATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO STUDY THE BEST WAY OF ADMINISTERING THIS TRUST AND THE INTENT IS TO CREATE THE TRUST BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF NEXT YEAR. THE OTHER ELEMENT OF THIS BILL ARE NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CHANGES AND FIXES WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSING PLANNING AND PRODUCTION LANGUAGE SHOULD THAT WAS ENACTED IN JUNE THIS INCLUDES TIMELINE CHANGES FOR NOTICE AND FINDINGS OF ANY VIOLATIONS AS WELL AS CLARIFICATION OF ANY REMEDIES INCLUDING HOW THEY RELATE TO THE REMEDIES AB SEVENTY TWO THAT WAS ENACTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND THEN FINALLY WITH A CART TO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS ENABLING THEM TO ACCESS UP 225% OF THE AVAILABLE PLANNING PRODUCTION FUNDING FOR THEIR SIX CYCLE RENO GOALS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ON ANY OF THESE ELEMENTS THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY QUESTIONS. ANY QUESTIONS THIRTY NIELSEN. COULD YOU A- INDICATE HOW THE STRESSED IS GOING TO ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED AND FORCED. ORGANIZE MONITORED. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS STUDYING THE GENERAL OUTLINE IS THAT THE REASON WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO A NONPROFIT TRIES TO SAID THAT THAT TRUST CAN BURN A SUFFICIENT RATE OF RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING CAN EXIST IN PERPETUITY AND A NONPROFIT CAN INVEST THOSE FUNDS IN A MATTER THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHILE STILL ENSURING THAT ITS INVESTMENT MATTER THAT STATION PRUDENT BUT ALSO GAINS THAT RATE OF RETURN WHERE YOU CAN USE THE MONEY YEAR OVER YEAR IN A WAY THAT'S MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN IF THE MONEY WERE KEPT WITHIN THE STATE. AT THE SAME TIME TO YOUR POINT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHTS OF THE OVERSIGHT OF FINES BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT USED EFFECTIVELY SO THE TWO MAJOR PURPOSES WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INSTRUCTIONS AND NOT SETTLEMENT ARE NUMBER ONE HELPING PREVENT FORECLOSURES AND NUMBER TWO REALLY FOR RENTERS AND LEGAL AID FOR THEM AS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO THE DETAIL THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTS TO STUDY. AND WANTS TO BE INTO OPTIONS WILL OF COURSE REQUIRE FURTHER ACTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE EVERYTHING IS CREATED AND GETS GOING HOW CLEAR IS THE LEGISLATIVE HOURS THE STORY HERE IT WOULD APPEAR. THE ADMINISTRATION CARRIES MOST OF THE AUTHORITY. IN OVERSEEING THIS TRUST. TO THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE TO APPROPRIATE THE MONEY. AND AS PART OF THAT THAT WOULD BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON HOW THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATED INCLUDING THE DESIGN OF ANY OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS FOR THAT MONEY. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD MAKE OBLIGATIONS. IT WOULD PUT PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT NOT BE THE CASE. ULTIMATELY THE FIGHT THE FINAL BILL GOVERNING HOW THIS MONEY IS USED WOULD HAVE TO BE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. BUT IT DOES GIVE FRONT END PRESSURE I THINK. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE A VIEW ON HOW THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT IN THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR RELEASED PROPOSAL ALONG THESE LINES ABOUT A MONTH AGO. BUT IT WAS IN CONCERT WITH DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THOSE DISCUSSIONS WILL BE ON GOING THIS PROCESS IS. DEFINITELY NOT COMPLETE BILL IS CHAPTER THEN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. SO THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE INTENT LANGUAGE THE MONEY IS TRANSFERRED INTO THIS ACCOUNT AND THEN IF THIS BILL IS PASSED THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAS IN PREPARATION TO STUDY FURTHER OPTIONS FOR EXACTLY WHAT THE OVERSIGHT MECHANISM IS AND HOW EXACTLY THE MONEY WILL BE USED. BUT IT WILL TAKE FURTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION NEXT YEAR BEFORE ANY OF THESE FUNDS CAN BE TRANSFERRED TO A NON PROFIT OR BEFORE ANY BOARD IS ESTABLISHED WITH APPOINTMENTS OVERSEEING THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS IN THAT NONPROFIT OR WITH REGARD TO HOW THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY DISPERSED ALL OF THAT WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL. ACTION. THAT WOULD BE BUDGET ACTION TRAILER BILL ACTION. BUT WHAT FORM YES IT WOULD BE WOULD BE CERTAINLY LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN SOME FORM WITH REGARD TO BE EXACT VEHICLE UP BEAT OUT BE DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT AGAIN IT WOULD BE THE- THE REASON FOR. ESTABLISHING THE- SETTLEMENT TRUST. WHAT WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BY THIS METHOD. YES SO WHEN IT COMES TO THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS FOLLOWS ON WHAT THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION ON HAD BEEN. PURSUING A COURT CASE WITH REGARD TO THE USE THAT MONEY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND GOVERNOR BROWN HAD SIGNED DIFFERENT USE OF THAT MONEY FOR THOSE FINES. THAT WAS REJECTED BY THE COURT AND THE COURT SAID THE MONEY HAS TO BE RE PROCREATIVE IN LINE WITH THE SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS. SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE THAT MONEY WITH REGARD TO THE SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL A- RELATIVELY SERVICE CIRCUMSCRIBED UNIVERSE. AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVED IN WHAT WE HOPE D. F. FITS WITH WHAT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES ARE IS THAT RATHER THAN USING IT ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND SAYING THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT SPEND IT ON A OR D. ON A ONE YEAR OR THREE YEAR BASIS AND IT'S TIME WHY DON'T WE CREATE AN ON GOING PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING AND PART OF THAT WAS INSPIRED BY. WHAT OCCURRED AND THE ENACTMENT OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WHERE THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR A RENTER PROTECTIONS MONEY THAT FLOW THROUGH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT WITH APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE AND WE WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF RATHER THAN THAT BEING SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. THERE. WERE A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE YEAR OVER YEAR. WITH THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THE- MONEY WILL BE MADE AND AS YOU INDICATED FOR THE WE DID A CRUCIAL MONEY AND WAS ABLE TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS A- AND IDEA PROGRAM. WELL THE INVESTMENT COULD GO BAD AS WELL WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT CASE CITIES ARE THE DETAILS THAT HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT ITS WHY THE PROGRAM IS NOT BEING ESTABLISHED RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY AS PART OF ANY MACINNES OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS HE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE AN INVESTMENT POLICY SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW HOW OTHER BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE PENSION FUNDS ARE RAIMES WHEN HE RETURNED IS NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT TO HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW YOU MIGHT REACT TO THAT SO THOSE ARE ALL ELEMENTS WHERE THEY'RE BEING OVERSIGHT BOARD THERE'D BE AN INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OR PERSON RESPONSIBLE WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THAT. APPOINTEES TO THAT BOARD AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE TO USE AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE OF RETURN EXPECTED ON YOUR IN TERMS YEAR PAY OUT AND THEN WITH THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE MARKET NOT HAVE TO ADJUST FOR YOU SET UP HIGHER AND PERHAPS THAT MORE AVERAGE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN AND THEN WHEN IT DOES GO LOW FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AS WE SAW IN THE GREAT RECESSION YOU REDUCE YOUR PAY OUT TO SOME OF THESE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE WORKED OUT AND IT'S WHY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STUDY BECAUSE THAT IS A- QUESTION THAT IS THERE IS NO SIMPLE ANSWER TO THAT. WELL. IT APPEARS A LITTLE BIT TOO VAGUE AND DYNAMIC. TO SUIT ME I'VE I'M NOT COMFORTABLE ENOUGH AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. PUBLIC COMMENT. SEE NONE WE'VE HAD A MOTION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL IF YOU WANT THIRTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS MITCHELL DIED JULY NIELSEN WE ALSO KNOW WELL BILL AYE CARREIRO. CAREER AYE DOLLY.

NUMBER GUY WAY BECAUSE HE HAS THE AYE. WE'RE GONNA HOLD ITEM OPEN MOVING ON TO THE FOURTH ITEM ON THE AGENDA AB ONE FOURTEEN EDUCATION FINANCE. AB ONE FOURTEEN EDUCATION TRAILER BILL THIS BILL MAKES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL CHANGES ONE IS WITH REGARD TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO CALPERS AND CAL STARS ON BEHALF OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THOSE PAYMENTS DO NOT COUNT WITH REGARD TO THE ROUTINE RESTRICTING MEETINGS MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IMPOSED ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS IS WITH REGARD TO THE FACILITIES BOND PROGRAMS AND BECAUSE OF THESE PAYMENTS CAME AT THE END OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET YEAR. THIS BILL CLARIFIES TO ADD THESE PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE TO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES WITH REGARD TO SCHOOLS EXISTING REQUIREMENTS TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BOND PROGRAMS SO VERY TECHNICAL BUT IMPORTANT CHANGE IN ADDITION THIS BILL INCLUDES SOME SHIPS WITH REGARD TO. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SETTLED FUNDING ALSO TECHNICAL CHANGES A SMALL SHIPS IN THE BILL ABILITY A FEDERAL FUNDS AND THEN FINALLY TO MORE SUBSTANTIVE AREAS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FIRST IS A DATE SHIFTED AWAY IN TERMS OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM WHEN THAT IS READY AND THAT OF COURSE HAS BEEN. CONVERSATION WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND SECOND A CLARIFICATION OF THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE BUDGET ACT THIS WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT THOSE ACCOUNTS ARE AVAILABLE AT TO ALL CHILDREN. THANK YOU QUESTIONS MEMBERS. WE HAVE A SENATOR NIELSEN. AN ISSUE REGARDING THE ETHNIC STUDIES CORRECT. WHAT WHY IS THE THERE A NEED FOR. CHANGING THE DEADLINE ARE WE BEHIND OUR WE HAVE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ACCOMPLISHED. IS IT. WHAT WHAT'S THE LADY OR THE NEED SO I BELIEVE THAT ACCORDING TO THE LAW THAT WAS ENACTED I THINK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE HAD TO BE ADOPTION OF THAT CURRICULUM BY THE BOARD BY MARCH THIRTY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR. AND SO I THINK AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS IN DISCUSSIONS OVER SOME OF THE TRAPS PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL TIME SO IT'S BASICALLY BASED ON THAT STATUTORY DEADLINE. FROM THE BILL THREE YEARS AGO. AND IN TERMS OF THIS SERVICE. THE CONTENT OF IT. THE ETHNIC STUDIES PARAMETERS CONTENT. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THERE. WHICH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CONCERN OVER THIS. IT WOULD APPEAR TO ME THAT WE WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH I WILL EVER HAD A HEARING IN DEPTH ON THIS. ISSUE. TWO I CAN'T SPEAK TODAY HEARINGS IN OTHER COMMITTEES I'M NOT FULLY AWARE BUT I WILL SAY THE ONE KEY THING THAT THIS BILL DIES IS A CREATES ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL TIME YES BUT WE DON'T KNOW IN WHAT FORM. THIS ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY. WOULD OCCUR IN THE IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE I'M SURE IT WILL BECAUSE IT WAS INITIATED TO A POLICY BE ALSO WOULD BE THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE. WE'RE JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL TO TWEAK IT TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THE DELIBERATIONS. AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE. ON THE FEWER MEMBERS OF YOUR CAUCUS WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE IN THE CONVERSATION YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED BUT I'M UNCOMFORTABLE TO PROCEED AT THIS POINT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENT. I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION FROM OF OLD THANK YOU THIRDLY THE MOVE BY THE POLICY COMMITTEE CHAIR ACTUALLY.

ONE FIFTEEN MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION PROVIDER. FINANCE AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THEIR PRE EXISTING MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX AND AB EXPIRED AT THE END OF THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY NINETEEN THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SO RETROACTIVE AND IT WOULD GO FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS THE EXPECTED REVENUE INCREASE FROM ARE THE RESULT OF THIS BILL IS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR GROWING TO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO HAVE THE TAX BE STARTING ON JULY FIRST PAPERWORK HAS TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND WE SHOULD NOTE AS A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THAT FEDERAL APPROVAL OF THIS TAX IS NOT CERTAIN BUT WE BELIEVE THAT SUBMITTING IT BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH AND THE WAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN DESIGNED WITH INPUT FROM A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE OF FEDERAL APPROVAL THE TAXES BASED ON CUMULATIVE ENROLLMENT IN THE PLANS BOTH PLANS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE AS WELL AS MEDI CAL PROGRAM PEOPLE CONTRA AGES I'M SORRY IN SERVICE TO CONTRACT WITH. DH CS AND IS BASED ON A PER AND REALLY BASIS BASED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAME WITH AN ENROLLMENT AND OFFERS TAXES BASED ON TEARS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TAX IS BEST DESIGNED TO SURVIVE. ANY FEDERAL SCRUTINY AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR NIELSEN. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND- HAS NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN A REAL POWERFUL AGENCY WITH DISH WOULD APPEAR TO ME TO GREATLY EXPAND ITS POWERS AS WE ARE DOING IN MANY CASES AGENCY BY AGENCY YEAR BY YEAR BILL BY BILL BUDGET BY BUDGET. ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT AGENCIES THE POWER. THE POWER TO. THE LATTER INCREASED TAXES AND FEES. AND THAT DOES NOT GO THROUGH A NORMAL PROCESS OF DELIBERATION IN THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. THAT CONCERNS ME THIS IS BECOME A HABIT. WHY WOULD WE WANT TO GET HEALTH SERVICES THIS AUTHORITY. SO ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN I'LL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LAMB WHICH IS THAT THE ACTUAL TAX OF COURSE IS A FUNCTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENT YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO YOU WITH REGARD TO OVER DO TAX AMOUNTS AND HOW THOSE ARE HANDLED CERTAINLY DEMONSTRATION WANTS TO MAKE SURE IN A FAIR PROCESS THAT ALL TAXES ARE PAID AND WILL TURN OVER TO MISTER LAMB TO DISCUSS. GEN ONE PART OF FINANCE WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS EXTENDING EXISTING TAX THAT IT'S CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR NOW. AND I WOULD ADD EIGHT EIGHT EXTANT ATTACKS THAT THE LEGISLATURE VOTED ON SEVERAL YEARS AGO ONLY ESTABLISH THE MCL TAX ON WOULD FURTHER ADD. ON THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT MANAGES THE LARGEST MEDICAID SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. AND FURTHER THE MCO TAXES AND REQUIRE ALL. A FEDERAL WAIVER IS THAT CORRECT FEDERAL APPROVAL YES THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON EXTENSION OF. THE MCO TAX WHICH WILL ACTUALLY BRING IN MORE MONEY TO STAY TO CALIFORNIA. BRING IN MORE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR MEDI CAL PROGRAM. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ARE A STILL A- DONOR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO WE PAY MORE IN FEDERAL TAXES OF CALIFORNIANS THEN WE RECEIVED BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS AGAIN IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. HELP RIGHT THAT BALANCE TO BRING MORE OF THOSE FUNDS THAT WE PAY HIS TAXPAYERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BACK TO CALIFORNIA. SO AGAIN. BUT DOES THEN AGAIN WHAT THANK THE MINISTRY FOR WORKING LEGISLATURE TO SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED. AND FACT AS CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB THREE. OVERSEEING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE BROUGHT UP AND DISCUSSED IN OUR HEARING. SO IT HAS BEEN HEARD THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE HAVE COME TO A POINT WHERE. THERE'S AGREEMENT THAT WE SHOULD EXTEND THIS PARTICULAR. TAX I WOULD ASSUME AND HOPE THAT. OUT WITH THE REVENUES THAT THAT COME FROM THIS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENJOYING FOR. MANY YEARS AGAIN. IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REINVEST INTO OF COURSE INCREASING ACCESS AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW THROUGH WHAT WE'VE VOTED ON IN THE- MAIN BUDGET THE VALUE BASED PURCHASING TO LOOK AT WAYS WE CAN AND- ALSO INVEST THIS MONEY TO. IMPROVE QUALITY WHILE IMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND ARE MEDI CAL. PROGRAM IN IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO I. WANT. THANK DEMONSTRATION FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER SO THAT WE ARE NOW ON THE SAME PAGE ON EXTENDING THIS VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR MEDICAID. OR MEDICARE PROGRAM AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND BE SURE WE USE THE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT WILL. AGAIN THE XP CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE EFFORTS WE'VE MADE AN ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. AND ALSO TO ALSO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BEND THE COST CURVE AS WELL AS IMPROVED QUALITY. LEVEL FOR PATIENTS ON MEDI CAL FOR THE PARTICULAR COMES ROUND CHRONIC DISEASE IN VALUE BASED PURCHASING. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS CENTER NIELSEN. LET ME JUST KIND OF RUDE BUT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME SUPPORT FOR THIS I WILL STIPULATE TO RICH BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME OPPOSITION. TO THIS. AT LEAST ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE. LEGISLATIVELY THERE IS OPPOSITION. THE EXPANSION OF MEDI CAL. AND GIVING AN AGENCY SO MORE UNILATERAL AUTHORITY. TO DO THIS CREATES LONG TERM FISCAL OBLIGATIONS. WHEN THE ECONOMY IS STRONG. WE DO JUST FINE. TOO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE FORGETTING WHEN WE WERE TWENTY ONE NINE BILLION IN THE RED AND FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE RED. AND A PREVIOUS BUDGET. WHERE THERE WAS A BIT OF A SURPLUS THAT MONEY WAS SPENT PLUS. INCREASED OBLIGATIONS TO THE FUTURE WERE BUILT IN. WE ENDED UP. IN A HUGE. DEFICIT. IN ONE GOVERNOR PAID A VERY DEAR PRICE. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WE LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IN PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE S.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST AN OBSERVATION AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOES BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT AND I'M CHANGE I GUESS SEMANTICS NO REALITY. FOR DECADES THE OLD MANTRA WAS. TAX AND SPEND. AND I'M WATCHING OVER THE YEARS A CHANGE IN STATE GOVERNMENT WERE WHICH- MISSION. TO NOW BE SPEND AND TAX MEANING. OBLIGATIONS OF FUNDING. IS VOTED BY THE BUDGET BY THE LEGISLATURE. WHICH THEN CREATES THE PRESSURE ON THE LEGISLATURE TO FUND THE EXPENDITURE SO NOW WE BECOME SPEND. AND THEN TAX. AND PART OF THAT DYNAMIC IS GIVING AGENCIES. INCREDIBLE ABILITY. TO IN FACT INCREASE FREEZE. THE CHURCH EVEN TAXES. AND THAT DOES NOT I THINK BRING WELL. WITH THE TAXPAYERS WITH THE CITIZENS. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE INTO CERTAINLY HEARD IT BEFORE THE MOST OF THEM THE ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY. IN AB ONE FIFTEEN IS THE MCO TAX WHICH QUITE FRANKLY IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL IF WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE WAR TAX I APPRECIATE. THE CONFUSION ALL WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE HEALTH PLANS TODAY WHO STEP FORWARD IN SUPPORTING. THIS UNIQUE SCENARIO BETWEEN HEALTH PLANS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE. WITH THAT WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR ABOUT. AB ONE FIFTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE NIELSEN NIELSEN NOBEL BILL I CABALLERO CAREER ON A DOLLY DOLLY KNOW HER DAUGHTER HER DAUGHTER I JONES JONES NO LEYVA LEYVA AYE MCGUIRE MONEY MONEY NINE MORE LOCK PAN. PAN AYE ROTH ROTH AYE SKINNER SKINNER AYE STERN STERN AYE STONE. STONE NO. BURKE NUMBER GUY Y. KASKI BECAUSE HE AYE. THE WHOLE THAT ITEM OPEN MOVING TO ITEM SIX ON THE AGENDA AB ONE SIXTEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE. SO THIS TRAILER BILL AB ONE SIXTEEN REFERS SPECIFICALLY TO ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS ALSO KNOWN AS HE AYE FTC'S CURRENTLY TO CREATE THESE DISTRICTS THERE IS THE 55% VOTER THRESHOLD FOR APPROVAL BEFORE THE DISTRICTS CAN ACTUALLY ISSUE THAT. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REMOVES THAT THRESHOLD UNDER CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS WINDOWS OR MAC SPECIFICALLY OF AN E. I. F. T. THAT IS DESIRING TO. GO FOR FINANCING PASSED TO HAVE THREE PUBLIC HEARINGS THEY HAVE TO GIVE NOTICE TO LANDOWNERS AND OTHER RESIDENTS WITHIN THE I. F. T. OF THOSE HEARINGS AND THEN AFTER THOSE HEARINGS IF MORE THAN FIFTY PER 50% OF THE PEOPLE PROTEST IN THAT AREA. DAN THAT HE I HAVE TO FINANCING PLAN IS TERMINATED IF BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 50% OF THE LANDOWNERS AND RESIDENTS PROTEST THEN THEY WOULD HAVE AN ELECTION AND THE I HAVE TO FINANCING PLAN MUST BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS AND FEWER THAN PROTEST. THEN THE FINANCING PLAN CAN MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TAX HOW THESE THE I FD FINANCING PLANS ARE APPROVED WHAT THE HOPE AND PURPOSE THAT MORE THERE WILL BE MORE BCI AFTER HE'S PROVIDING LOCAL AND REGIONAL COORDINATION FOR THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT THESE THE IRAQIS WERE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. IN ADDITION THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD REQUIRE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTING FROM THE AND HAS INTRODUCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. ON QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIRD AVAIL. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ARE OFFERED THE REGIONAL I HAVE THE I'VE D. BILL WHICH HAD. ON VOTING REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL DOES AWAY WITH THAT BUT IT DOES AWAY WITH IT AND PUTS IN THE STATUTE. SOME OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE MESSY LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE THE OLD BILL HAD REGISTERED VOTERS THIS BILL SAYS RESIDENTS. I MEAN WHO WHO IS A RESIDENT OF ANYBODY OVER EIGHTEEN. SO IT'S MESSY THIS BILL BILL HAD LAND OWNERS AND IT BASS THE LAND OWNERS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ACRES THEY OWN SO WE HAD LIKE A PROPORTIONALITY IN TERMS OF. THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY A PARCEL ON BY THE LANDLORD THIS BILL HAS NO TO THOSE KIND OF COMMENTS SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES THE SAME NUMBER OF VOTES FOR OF A RESIDENT THAT'S LIVING IN AN APARTMENT. AS SOMEBODY OWNS A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT I'VE I FIND THAT KIND OF MESSY I THINK THAT'S. SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO CLEAN UP. IS NOT PROPORTIONATE TO YOU KNOW THE IS SAYS ANYBODY OVER EIGHTEEN SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE A REGISTERED VOTER YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO'S A RESIDENT IN TERMS OF THE PROTEST PROVISIONS SO IT CREATES A- TO ME MESSY STANDARD FOR ANYBODY TRYING TO CREATE THESE WHICH TO ME MEANS THAT IT WOULD LIMIT THE. ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE THESE. ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS I LIKE TO SEE THIS LANGUAGE CLEANED UP. WE SHOULD WORK ON IT I POINTED THIS OUT TO PEOPLE THE BILL WASN'T CHANGED BUT I INTEND TO. CONTINUE TO WORK ON. OF TRYING TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS THE LANGUAGE IN THE FUTURE I THINK IT HAS TO BE CLEANED UP TO MAKE THESE. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS MORE EFFECTIVE THE ORIGINAL BILL. OF CREATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS ONLY USE BUT I THINKTHREE WE ONLY HAD THREE SUCCESSFUL. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS CREATED. AND I THINK THIS MESSY LANGUAGE MIGHT INHIBIT US. AND LIMIT ITS USE IN TWO WEEKS WE CLEAN THIS UP SO. I SUPPORT THIS TODAY I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON CLEAN THIS UP. AND. HOPE WE CAN GET SUPPORT FOR DOING THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR NIELSEN. FATAL FAILURE NOW TAKING CONTROL AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES I SHARE IS CONCERNED PROBABLY HAVE EVEN A GREATER CONCERN ABOUT THAT. THIS SO CALLED PROTEST PROVISIONS. IT'S JUST AN EASY WAY OUT. IT'S AN EASY WAY TO SAY WE DID SOMETHING WHEN YOU REALLY DON'T DO ANYTHING YOU DESCEND POWER. DISENFRANCHISES THE VOTERS THE CITIZENS THERE IS NO COST FOR THAT. THESE DISTRICTS WERE PROBLEMATIC. IN THE BE USED. IN REMOVED. AND NOW THERE'S A CREEPING WAY. TO BRING THEM BACK. WITH I WOULD ARGUE EVEN LESS ACCOUNTABILITY. THAN WE EVER HAD BEFORE. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR STERN WE HAVE A MOTION VERY GOOD I JUST WANT TO GET QUICK COMMENT THERE I MY SENSE WAS FROM CENTER BILL THAT IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF DIS EMPOWERING THAT IT MAY BE OVER EMPOWERS THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE A DIRECT STAKE IN THE E. I. F. T. PROCESS JUST WANNA GET A COMMENT FROM FINANCE THERE IN TERMS OF OPENNESS TO. MAKING THIS FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN STALLED OUT PRINCES IN LOS ANGELES FOR MANY YEARS TRYING TO GET THE LA RIVER WHICH IS A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL REGION THAT NEEDS THIS KIND OF DISTRICT TO BE COHESIVE IN FINANCE SYMBOL AND WE THINK THERE'S A PLAN TO DO THAT BUT- WE GOT TO. SORT THROUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE JUST A QUICK COMMENT SORT OF THE LABOR YES SERVICE CENTER BILL HAD MENTIONED THAT WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW WE SAYS OF THE START OF THIS YEAR THE DAD I SEEN THEY'RE ONLY THREE E. I. ESTY SET UP INFORMED AND SO PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S CALL WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS TO GET MORE OF THESE DISTRICTS FORMED IN PLACES WHERE THEY ARE USEFUL AND THE REASON WE PUT IN THESE PROVISIONS ARE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF SENATOR NIELSEN. TO MAKE SURE WHERE THERE IS COMMUNITY OPPOSITION TO THESE TYPES OF PROVISIONS THERE CAN BE A VOTE OR IF IT'S MORE THE IF IT'S A MORE IF IT'S A MAJORITY OF VOTERS AND THE FINANCING LAN DOES NOT MOVE FORWARD SO THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IF THERE ARE IN THE ENSUING YEAR BETTER WAYS OF REACHING THAT GOAL AND MAKING SURE CALIBRATION. IS RIGHT WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION. PUBLIC COMMENT. VENTURE MEMBERS MATTHEW HARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ON THE ONE SIDE REPRESENTING PROPERTY OWNERS ON THE OTHER SIDE I'M ALSO HERE TO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FROM LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE'D LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT HOW WE DO THINK THAT THIS LANGUAGE HE'S TO BE TIGHTENED UP A LITTLE BIT THESE DISTRICTS ARE VERY USEFUL THEY'RE NOT THE DISTRICTS OF THE PAST THREE HEARD ABOUT ALL THE ABUSE I LIVE IN WEST SACRAMENTO RIGHT NOW WE PUT TOGETHER THE FIRST THE I FD AND THE STATE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT. BUT IT'S A VERY EXCELLENT THING THAT IS PRODUCING VERY GOOD RESULTS ON WEST SACRAMENTO SO AGAIN WE LIKE TO SUPPORT SENATOR BELLS COMMENTS ON THIS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AT TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE BOTH ON BEHALF OF PROPERTY OWNERS AND ON BEHALF OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOLKS ARE USING THIS TOOL THANK YOU.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. SAID AVAIL. WE HAVE A MOTION. I SUPPORT THE BILL. ARE THE PROPOSAL. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THE IDEA OF HAVING DIFFERENTIAL PAY FOR IN HIGH COST AREAS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN OUR AREA FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN HIRE AND RETAIN. PEOPLE TO CLEAN THE FREEWAYS IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FREEWAYS. THERE'S SO MANY VACANCIES THAT OCCUR EVERY YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE FIND JOBS THAT ARE PAID MORE. IN THE AREA AND THEY HAVE THEIR- THEIR THEIR SALARIES. ARE SO LOW COMPARED TO. THE SALARIES IN THE AREA WE CAN'T RETAIN PEOPLE AND AS A RESULT OF FREEWAYS ARE A MESS. AND WE HAVE A PROBLEM RETAINING WORKERS IN IN OUR AREA FROM FROM THE STATE. TO SERVICE. PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE TO THE COMMUNITY SO. SO THESE THESE ISSUES ARE ARE REALLY A SERVICE DELIVERY ISSUE. IN TERMS OF. RETAINING EMPLOYEES IN CREATING. THE PROPER ENVIRONMENT TO. PROVIDE SERVICE TO FOR THE PUBLIC AND IN. HIGH COST AREAS SO.
