CLOCK. DOCTOR WEBER BUTLER IN

00:34:31.303 --> 00:34:35.941 region:rollup2
THE OVER ARCHING THEME I THINK A

00:34:34.973 --> 00:34:39.044 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO PROVIDE IS

00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:40.378 region:rollup2
AT THE BUDGET AS IT IS PROPOSED.

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:43.848 region:rollup2
REALLY REFLECTS WHAT WE FEEL IS

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:45.617 region:rollup2
A CONSENSUS PRIORITY AMONG THE

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:48.553 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

00:34:45.617 --> 00:34:51.389 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:54.326 region:rollup2
CHIEF JUSTICE HERSELF AS WELL AS

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:56.695 region:rollup2
USUAL COUNSEL. A AS WELL AS OUR

00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:59.597 region:rollup2
TRIAL COURTS IN NAMELY IT IS

00:34:56.695 --> 00:35:00.799 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BUDGET REALLY REFLECTS

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:04.102 region:rollup2
OUR TOP PRIORITY UNITS A

00:35:00.799 --> 00:35:06.471 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS PRIORITY. OF WHICH IS

00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:08.974 region:rollup2
THAT IT PROVIDES NEW FUNDING FOR

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:11.376 region:rollup2
THE BASE OPERATIONS FROM A TRIAL

00:35:08.974 --> 00:35:15.947 region:rollup2
COURTS AND NOT JUST NEW FUNDING

00:35:11.376 --> 00:35:19.217 region:rollup2
BUT

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:22.087 region:rollup2
EXPAND. AND OR CREATE NEW TYPES

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:23.054 region:rollup2
OF SELF HELP SERVICES WHICH WILL

00:35:22.087 --> 00:35:25.991 region:rollup2
ADDRESS WHAT IS REALLY THE

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:30.462 region:rollup2
FASTEST GROWING PUBLIC NEED.

00:35:25.991 --> 00:35:34.466 region:rollup2
IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:35:30.462 --> 00:35:36.301 region:rollup2
IN OUR COURTS IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:35:34.466 --> 00:35:39.170 region:rollup2
SECOND COMPONENT A IS

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:43.341 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY FORTY EIGHT

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:44.642 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:35:43.341 --> 00:35:46.945 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER THE EFFORT TO

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:49.180 region:rollup2
EQUALIZE FUNDING AMONG OUR

00:35:46.945 --> 00:35:51.116 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TRIAL COURTS AND WE

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.051 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT IN TIME

00:35:51.116 --> 00:35:55.420 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PROPOSAL WOULD BENEFIT

00:35:53.051 --> 00:35:58.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY FOUR. OF OUR MOST

00:35:55.420 --> 00:36:01.593 region:rollup2
SEVERELY UNDER UNDER FUNDED THE

00:35:58.123 --> 00:36:02.227 region:rollup2
COURTS.

00:36:01.593 --> 00:36:03.828 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:06.197 region:rollup2
THINK MEMBERS BECAME AWARE OF

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:07.399 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE IN THE FIFTH AND

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:09.367 region:rollup2
FINAL AND MOST DIFFICULT YEAR OF

00:36:07.399 --> 00:36:11.536 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR PROJECT. AT THE

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:14.105 region:rollup2
COURT SYSTEM INITIATED WHICH WAS

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:14.939 region:rollup2
TO SHIFT MONEY FROM SOME COURTS

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:18.376 region:rollup2
TO OTHER COURTS THAT WERE SO

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:20.912 region:rollup2
SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED AND LAST

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:21.846 region:rollup2
YEAR WAS A DIFFICULT YEAR IN

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:22.747 region:rollup2
FACT IT'S THE CURRENT YEAR FOR

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:24.549 region:rollup2
US IS A DIFFICULT YEAR BECAUSE

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:25.383 region:rollup2
WE DID SO ABSENT NEW FUNDING.

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:27.752 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS REALLY

00:36:25.383 --> 00:36:28.953 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT THIS YEAR TO BE ABLE

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:34.793 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE ADVANCE THE

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:37.195 region:rollup2
EQUALIZATION OF FUNDING BUT TO

00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:39.431 region:rollup2
DO SO WITH NEW RESOURCES BUT

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:41.466 region:rollup2
WHICH WE THINK WILL BE

00:36:39.431 --> 00:36:43.101 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY ADVANTAGES TO ALL

00:36:41.466 --> 00:36:45.537 region:rollup2
COURTS IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN

00:36:43.101 --> 00:36:48.873 region:rollup2
LASTLY. THE THIRD COMPONENT LA

00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:51.376 region:rollup2
IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:52.010 region:rollup2
IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.

00:36:51.376 --> 00:37:03.455 region:rollup2
THAT WAY LAW AND I WANT TO MAKE

00:36:52.010 --> 00:37:03.855 region:rollup2
SURE

00:37:03.455 --> 00:37:05.857 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:09.961 region:rollup2
THOUGH IT'S NOT QUITE A

00:37:05.857 --> 00:37:13.364 region:rollup2
COMPLETE OVERLAP IT WOULDN'T BE

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:14.566 region:rollup2
A TOTAL ARE COMPLETE SOLAR OR

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:15.300 region:rollup2
LUNAR ECLIPSE.

00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:16.568 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:22.173 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

00:37:16.568 --> 00:37:24.609 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES OF OUR CHIEF JUSTICES

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:27.412 region:rollup2
THAT YOU JUST OR AND THE

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:31.049 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR

00:37:27.412 --> 00:37:32.951 region:rollup2
IS A TRIAL COURT'S.

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:34.285 region:rollup2
AND SO WITH THAT I WANTED TO LET

00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:37.756 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR VIEW OUR SUPPORT

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:38.723 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROPOSAL. A AND WE HOPE

00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:40.391 region:rollup2
AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY THROUGH

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:42.127 region:rollup2
YOUR DELIBERATIONS YOU WILL SEE

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.727 region:rollup2
THAT IT WILL HELP. OUR COURTS

00:37:42.127 --> 00:37:49.834 region:rollup2
HELP WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:51.503 region:rollup2
LAW.

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:54.506 region:rollup2
CENTER THE TOTAL LEVEL OF FUN

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:55.440 region:rollup2
I WOULD LIKE TO

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:56.174 region:rollup2
BY THE RELATIVE TO ITS GENERAL

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.941 region:rollup2
FUND SPENDING PRIORITIES.

00:37:56.174 --> 00:37:58.510 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT TO

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.544 region:rollup2
WHATEVER ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:02.714 region:rollup2
PROVIDED BE PROVIDED BASED ON

00:37:59.544 --> 00:38:03.681 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SUCH AS

00:38:02.714 --> 00:38:06.751 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE SPECIFIED TOUCHES

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:08.419 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS OR SERVICES OR A COLA

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.320 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT WHAT WOULD BE IT.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:11.289 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ALLOWING JUDICIAL

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.124 region:rollup2
COUNCIL TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:15.326 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:16.394 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.562 region:rollup2
THE AUGMENTATION WOULD BE SPENT

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:18.696 region:rollup2
BECAUSE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WOULD

00:38:17.562 --> 00:38:20.365 region:rollup2
HAVE COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY AND

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:22.500 region:rollup2
USING THOSE FUNDS.

00:38:20.365 --> 00:38:24.102 region:rollup2
SO THE FUNDS COULD BE ALLOCATED

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:24.936 region:rollup2
TO THE INDIVIDUAL TRIAL COURTS

00:38:24.102 --> 00:38:26.471 region:rollup2
ON WALL FROM AS HAS BEEN DONE

00:38:24.936 --> 00:38:28.339 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY.

00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.973 region:rollup2
OR IT COULD BE USED TO TO FIND

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.775 region:rollup2
FUTURES COMMISSIONS

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.176 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH IS

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.443 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE

00:38:31.176 --> 00:38:33.411 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION HAS MENTIONED.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:35.213 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IT WITHOUT COSTS AND

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:36.881 region:rollup2
BENEFITS FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:38:35.213 --> 00:38:37.549 region:rollup2
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY AND TO

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.316 region:rollup2
WHAT EXTENT THOSE

00:38:37.549 --> 00:38:39.851 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS COULD BE

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:41.119 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:42.420 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WANT TO

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:43.221 region:rollup2
WEIGH IN ON SOME OF THOSE

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.324 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD BE

00:38:43.221 --> 00:38:46.925 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:49.594 region:rollup2
IN REGARDS TO THE EQUALIZATION

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:50.862 region:rollup2
FUNDING. EQUALIZATION CAN OCCUR

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:52.197 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO TO THE

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:53.164 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY

00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:55.133 region:rollup2
FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:57.502 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN SPECIFY HOW THEY

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:58.670 region:rollup2
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:38:57.502 --> 00:39:00.371 region:rollup2
FINALLY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.439 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF WHETHER

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:03.007 region:rollup2
THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS CURRENT

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:04.776 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD BASED METHODOLOGY

ACCURATELY ESTIMATES TRIAL

00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:06.811 region:rollup2
COURTNEY. AND SO WE DO

00:39:05.243 --> 00:39:09.714 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND.

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:10.748 region:rollup2
CONVENING A WORKING GROUP TO

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:12.383 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGY AND

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:14.452 region:rollup2

THOUSAND NINETEEN.

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:18.056 region:rollup2
AN ACCURATE FORMULA WOULD HELP

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:19.657 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE THE

00:39:18.056 --> 00:39:21.993 region:rollup2

THE TRIAL COURT'SBUT IT'S ALSO

00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.197 region:rollup2

OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COME

00:47:46.197 --> 00:47:50.468 region:rollup2
THROUGH. THE FUTURES COMMISSION

FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

00:47:52.403 --> 00:47:56.374 region:rollup2
TWO OF WHICH I WOULD JUST LIKE

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:56.974 region:rollup2
TO PUT ON THIS COMMITTEES

00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:57.975 region:rollup2
RIGHT ARE MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:59.610 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD.

00:47:57.975 --> 00:48:02.380 region:rollup2
ASK US TO CONSIDER THEM.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:05.750 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF WHICH IS TESTING A A

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:07.651 region:rollup2
ONE COURT PILOT FOR COMBINING.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.452 region:rollup2
DODD JUVENILE COURTS TOGETHER IN

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.887 region:rollup2
A LARGER SENSE THERE'S SOME

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:11.389 region:rollup2
SMALL COUNTIES THAT HAVE COME BY

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:12.890 region:rollup2
JUVENILE COURTS BUT.

00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:15.126 region:rollup2
IF WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT

00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:17.061 region:rollup2
LARGER COUNTIES SANTA CLARA

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:19.697 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS BEEN WORKING ALONG.

00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:20.431 region:rollup2
THIS LINE BUT.

00:48:19.697 --> 00:48:21.966 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:48:20.431 --> 00:48:23.934 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN LOOKED AT BY THE BY

00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:24.835 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THE JUDICIAL.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:27.738 region:rollup2
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PUBLIC

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:29.640 region:rollup2
SAFETY AND HUMAN SERVICES HAD A

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:32.143 region:rollup2
JOINT HEARING TO LOOK A

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.978 region:rollup2
COMBINING THESE TWO.

00:48:32.143 --> 00:48:36.447 region:rollup2
AREAS WE TEND TO DO SO MUCH.

00:48:33.978 --> 00:48:36.947 region:rollup2
DECISIONS REALLY IN TWO VERY

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:38.749 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT.

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:40.551 region:rollup2
.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:42.286 region:rollup2
DUAL SYSTEM AND THAT DEPENDENCY

00:48:40.551 --> 00:48:43.087 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND NICK IF WORKING WITH

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.488 region:rollup2
THE COURTS IN THIS IS A

00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:46.791 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION COMMANDED FUTURES

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:47.858 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:49.193 region:rollup2
WE GOT HOW WE DO A BETTER SYSTEM

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.760 region:rollup2
FOR KIDS AT RISK THIS IS A STEP

00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:51.195 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.430 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD BE THAT

00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:54.698 region:rollup2
MUCH I DON'T HOW MUCH OF THE

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.499 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION BUT I THINK

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:56.033 region:rollup2
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT.

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:56.967 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHERS ALSO

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:59.236 region:rollup2
FEATURES COMMISSION

00:48:56.967 --> 00:49:00.638 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION THAT COMES OUT OF

00:48:59.236 --> 00:49:04.542 region:rollup2
A PROJECT IT'S BEEN BEEN WORKING

00:49:00.638 --> 00:49:05.443 region:rollup2
IN IN FRESNO WHERE THERE ARE.

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:07.344 region:rollup2
CHILD CUSTODY DECISIONS THAT

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:09.780 region:rollup2
DON'T INVOLVE ABUSE.

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:11.115 region:rollup2
AND THEY PROVIDED REAL MEDIATION

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.983 region:rollup2
THAT IS MEDIATION WITHOUT MAKING

00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:14.318 region:rollup2
A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEN SUCH

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:15.820 region:rollup2
INTERFERES WITH THE PARTIES

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:18.088 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TO COME TO A REAL

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.722 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT. AGAIN RECOMMENDED BY

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:20.024 region:rollup2
THE FUTURES COMMISSION I THINK

00:49:18.722 --> 00:49:21.992 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:23.427 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY LOOK AT THROUGH THIS

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:25.763 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND IF WE CAN PRIORITIZE

00:49:23.427 --> 00:49:26.330 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THOSE TWO. AREAS WE

00:49:25.763 --> 00:49:31.235 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:33.304 region:rollup2
PROTECTING KIDS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:34.472 region:rollup2
OKAY I WANT TO THANK YOU OFFER

00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.140 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I THINK

00:49:34.472 --> 00:49:38.008 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AS A COMMITTEE AND.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.844 region:rollup2
AND I'VE HAD A. NUMBER OF

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:41.645 region:rollup2
PERSONS TO CALL IN EXPRESS A

00:49:39.844 --> 00:49:42.913 region:rollup2
CONCERN NOT NOT ABOUT THE

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:44.148 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS THAT WE PUT OUT THERE

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.648 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UP AND SEVEN FIVE

00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:47.084 region:rollup2
MILLION IS OBVIOUSLY.

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:49.086 region:rollup2
WARRANTED AND PROBABLY EVEN

00:49:47.084 --> 00:49:50.254 region:rollup2
MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT WHERE HOW

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:52.022 region:rollup2
FAR WE NEED TO GO TO COURT. BUT

00:49:50.254 --> 00:49:52.790 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION BECOMES AS WE KEEP

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:54.258 region:rollup2
ASKING WHAT ARE THE REAL

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:56.060 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES THAT ARE GOING TO

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:56.861 region:rollup2
DRIVE THE ALLOCATION OF

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.929 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:00.764 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:03.000 region:rollup2
ISSUES HERE AND AND AT THIS AT

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:05.302 region:rollup2
OUR LEVEL WITH REGARDS TO. THE

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.904 region:rollup2
pNOT. WE DON'T KNOW IF IF YOU'RE

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:08.706 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING TO ADDRESS THE

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:10.641 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF TIME ALONG IT TAKES A

00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:11.942 region:rollup2
PERSON TO GET THE COURT. OF

00:50:10.641 --> 00:50:13.344 region:rollup2
THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES ARE VERY

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:15.045 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT APPEAR BECAUSE WE

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:16.714 region:rollup2
HEAR THAT A LOT FOR MY MEMBERS.

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:18.749 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE THINGS

00:50:16.714 --> 00:50:19.950 region:rollup2
AS MRS STONE TALKED ABOUT WITH

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.417 region:rollup2
THE CAR SUPPORT RESTRUCTURING

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.253 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:24.121 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE

00:50:22.253 --> 00:50:25.656 region:rollup2
THINGS AND SO YOU KNOW WE WANT

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:27.391 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:29.226 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO THAT AS WE. WE

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:30.995 region:rollup2
LISTEN AND WE HEAR THAT.

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:32.129 region:rollup2
THAT THERE THAT THE JUDICIAL

00:50:30.995 --> 00:50:34.398 region:rollup2
COUNCIL IN THE AND THE COURTS

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:35.466 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES ARE ALL WALKING AND

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:37.134 region:rollup2
TALKING PRETTY MUCH IN THE SAME

00:50:35.466 --> 00:50:38.269 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:38.936 region:rollup2
BUT YET I HEAR LITTLE

00:50:38.269 --> 00:50:39.837 region:rollup2
DISSIDENTS WHEN I HEAR THEM SAY

00:50:38.936 --> 00:50:43.340 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANT TO CONTROL WHAT WE

00:50:39.837 --> 00:50:45.442 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE MONEY. UP BECAUSE IT

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.778 region:rollup2
TO IT IF THAT'S THE CASE AND WE

00:50:45.442 --> 00:50:51.081 region:rollup2
COULD PROBABLY A FIGURE OUT THE.

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:52.883 region:rollup2
THE FORMULA AND ALLOCATED

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:54.485 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO THE COURTS AND

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:56.620 region:rollup2
BYPASS THE COUNCIL COMPLETELY

00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:59.757 region:rollup2
AND END UP GIVING IT TO THE

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:01.692 region:rollup2
COURTS THEMSELVES. AND NOT DEAL

00:50:59.757 --> 00:51:03.427 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNCIL IF IF IF

00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:06.397 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S WALKING AND TALKING

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:08.999 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME DIRECTION MAYBE THEY

00:51:06.397 --> 00:51:12.603 region:rollup2
ARE MAYBE THEY ARE. BUT IF THE

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:14.104 region:rollup2
MONEY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GO

00:51:12.603 --> 00:51:15.706 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THE COURTS IN THE DUST

00:51:14.104 --> 00:51:22.546 region:rollup2
SO THEN THE DISCRETION BECOMES

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:24.748 region:rollup2
THEIR DISCRETION. BUT I THINK

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:26.550 region:rollup2
WE'VE LEARNED FROM.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:27.117 region:rollup2
PLEASE I'VE LEARNED FROM LOCAL

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.384 region:rollup2
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.385 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:29.553 region:rollup2
THAT WITHOUT CLEAR GOALS AND

LIKE. YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:34.258 region:rollup2
WANT IN THE END AND SO IF WE'RE

00:51:33.691 --> 00:51:36.493 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE BETTER

SIR.

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:42.466 region:rollup2
OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HOW SO

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:43.934 region:rollup2

TO GIVE SOME AT LEAST SOME

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:53.010 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IN GUIDELINE AS TO HOW

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:54.912 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAPPEN. A IF IT'S A

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.946 region:rollup2

REGARDS TO ALLOCATION OF

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:59.016 region:rollup2

A SENSE OF THAT.

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:13.330 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME AND I THINK THAT

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:14.498 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WE TALK

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:16.367 region:rollup2

IMPORTANT FOR US AT THIS LEVEL

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:56.206 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE

00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:57.841 region:rollup2

CREATED THEM WITH THE LACK OF

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.516 region:rollup2

PRIORITIES IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:53:39.183 --> 00:53:43.754 region:rollup2
ITEM AND YOU KNOW THAT WE SHOULD

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:46.123 region:rollup2

THEMSELVES. IN THE HIGHEST

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.885 region:rollup2
FREQUENCY TYPE OF CASE.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:23.520 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION IT BUILDS AND

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:25.222 region:rollup2
EXPANDS UPON MANY OF THE EFFORTS

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.490 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES MISS CURRENT TOUCHED

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:28.258 region:rollup2
UPON THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

STAFF THE OHIO AND STAKEHOLDERS

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:41.071 region:rollup2
HAVE SHARED A LOT OF THOUGHTFUL

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:43.106 region:rollup2
INPUT FROM THE TRAILER BILL

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.940 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE FOR THIS ITEM. AND WE

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:45.308 region:rollup2
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:48.111 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUBLIC WORKS

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:49.980 region:rollup2
OKAY. ANY COMMENTS LA JOH.

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:51.348 region:rollup2
AS NOTED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
INCLUDES A THREE POINT FOUR

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.817 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ARE OFTEN

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.619 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION TWO MILLION OF THAT

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:58.021 region:rollup2
IS ONE TIME AND ONE POINT FOUR

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:59.923 region:rollup2
IS ONGOING. WE DO RECOMMEND

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.091 region:rollup2
APPROVING THE REQUEST BUT FOR

01:00:59.923 --> 01:01:03.093 region:rollup2
THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION

DOLLARS ONLY PROVIDING THAT ON A

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:06.263 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:07.964 region:rollup2
THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE FIND

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:09.699 region:rollup2
THAT IT IS PREMATURE TO PROVIDE

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:11.067 region:rollup2
ONGOING RESOURCES BEFORE A PILOT

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:13.103 region:rollup2
IS COMPLETE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:14.838 region:rollup2
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:16.239 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT SHOULD BE CONTINUED.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.173 region:rollup2
ON INTO THE FUTURE.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.575 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.876 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE OR MODIFY THE

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:21.678 region:rollup2
PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:23.446 region:rollup2
IN AT LEAST TWO WAYS TO ENSURE

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.148 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEGISLATURE. RECEIVES

01:01:23.446 --> 01:01:26.683 region:rollup2
THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:28.318 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THE PILOT.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.319 region:rollup2
THE FIRST AS MENTIONS ON

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.854 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY EIGHT COURTS ARE

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:33.156 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:34.491 region:rollup2
PILOT. WE RECOMMEND REQUIRING

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:36.059 region:rollup2
THAT EACH OF THE PROPOSED

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.460 region:rollup2

QUARTS.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.932 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN ALLOWING THE PILOT

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:43.500 region:rollup2
COURTS TO CHOOSE WHICH

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:44.834 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES THEY WANT TO TEST

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.136 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:47.437 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:48.738 region:rollup2
TESTED IN A COURT AND THEY'RE

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.040 region:rollup2

USERS.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.678 region:rollup2
SECOND WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.880 region:rollup2
JUDICIAL COUNCIL BE REQUIRED TO

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:03.620 region:rollup2
WELL THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:04.554 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY DOES REQUIRE A REPORT

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.256 region:rollup2
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.224 region:rollup2

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:18.668 region:rollup2
THE PILOT SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.970 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IT WILL LIKELY BE

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:21.438 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.005 region:rollup2

AS A PART OF OUR ADVOCACY WE'VE

DILEMMA HOWEVER IT'S FIVE COUNTY

01:03:15.692 --> 01:03:19.195 region:rollup2
PILOT PROPOSAL IS NOT NEARLY

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.664 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO FIX THE PROBLEM. FIRST

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:22.599 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ONLY COVER.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:23.867 region:rollup2
FIVE AND POSSIBLY EIGHT

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:25.201 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE FIVE COUNTIES.

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.736 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN WORKING

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:28.638 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES

WITH A FIVE COUNTY PIE THAT

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:36.079 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARD I'M

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:37.647 region:rollup2
SECOND THE PILOT PROVIDES NO

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:38.782 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR FINES AND FEES

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.916 region:rollup2

FINES AND FEES IN THIS PILOT

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:45.088 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE. TOTAL DISCRETION TO

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:47.057 region:rollup2
THE COURTS TO SET THE FINES WITH

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:48.725 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE TO REDUCE EXISTING AND

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:55.298 region:rollup2

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:02.972 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF A PERSON'S INCOME.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:06.042 region:rollup2
AND REQUIRING COURTS TO RICK TO

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:06.509 region:rollup2
REINSTATE SUSPENDED LICENSE ONCE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:06.810 region:rollup2
A PERSON MAKES A COURT

IN NEED.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.917 region:rollup2
AND CREATING A STATEWIDE

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:15.985 region:rollup2
STANDARD WOULD ALLOW

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.519 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE EQUITABLE

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:20.056 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THIS

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:21.958 region:rollup2

AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THERE'S

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.039 region:rollup2
BEEN ANOTHER NUMBER FOR FORUMS

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:38.341 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE IN THE LAST FEW

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:39.476 region:rollup2
YEARS. WE HAD AN AMNESTY PROGRAM

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.910 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHEN THAT

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.978 region:rollup2
HAPPENS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:43.613 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHOSE

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:44.914 region:rollup2

HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:52.422 region:rollup2
IN TICKETS. SO WE ABSOLUTELY

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.956 region:rollup2

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:10.407 region:rollup2
MANY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:12.108 region:rollup2
WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THESE

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:13.643 region:rollup2

01:12:37.954 --> 01:12:41.858 region:rollup2
NO COMMENTS.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.992 region:rollup2
OKAY I THINK VIA AUDIENCES HAS

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:45.061 region:rollup2
RAISED SOME VERY IMPORTANT

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:46.262 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND CONCERNS AND SO.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.830 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:49.665 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HERE WITH REGARDS TO

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:51.968 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT.

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:52.501 region:rollup2
LEAST THESE.

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:52.501 region:rollup2
THE SOFTWARE AND AND THE OF

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.804 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.007 region:rollup2
WILL BASICALLY HAVE THOSE OTHER

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:59.675 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS IN IT THAT WILL ALLOW

01:12:58.007 --> 01:13:01.644 region:rollup2
US TO IDENTIFY THOSE WHO CAN AND

01:12:59.675 --> 01:13:03.212 region:rollup2
CANNOT PAY I THINK THAT'S THE

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:04.647 region:rollup2
MAIN CONCERN. MUCH OF EVERYONE

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:07.216 region:rollup2
BEEN NOT OPPOSED TO ONLINE IN

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:08.217 region:rollup2
AND HAVING ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.719 region:rollup2
BUT THE QUESTION IS CAN ASK ALL

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.553 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS AND MAKE THE

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.455 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION THAT WE THINK IS

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:13.923 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. US SO THAT WE DON'T

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:16.692 region:rollup2
FURTHER SEND PEOPLE INTO.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:17.994 region:rollup2
AND DEBT AND DIFFICULTY OH BY

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:20.062 region:rollup2
HAVING SOMEONE THAT'S KIND OF

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:21.197 region:rollup2
VERY SO GENERIC THAT AGO DID IT

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.932 region:rollup2
MEET MEETS THE NEEDS OF.

01:13:21.197 --> 01:13:25.067 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED EVERYONE AND NO ONE AT

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:26.235 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME SO I. WILL LOOK AT

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.737 region:rollup2
THAT AND SO I I THINK IT IS

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.671 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:30.373 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:31.874 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO COME BACK AND ASSESS

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:32.408 region:rollup2
WHAT THE NOT WE WANT TO CONTINUE

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:36.312 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DO OFTEN PILOT

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:37.480 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:13:36.312 --> 01:13:38.347 region:rollup2
THE RIVER PILOT IS THAT'S

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.016 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE A TRIAL AARON TO

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.883 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:41.717 region:rollup2
MAKE A DECISION WHETHER NOT YOU

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.519 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTINUE.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.921 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES WITH WE USE THE TERM

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WE WOULD

01:24:37.706 --> 01:24:41.343 region:rollup2
NOTE HOWEVER THAT IT IS NOT

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.045 region:rollup2
QUITE CLEAR TO US WHY THIS

01:24:41.343 --> 01:24:44.313 region:rollup2

CONSIDERED.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.984 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:50.886 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO SELF

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:53.722 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN THIS

01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:56.191 region:rollup2
MANNER THROUGH A WEB PORTAL. ON

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:57.459 region:rollup2
IS A PRIORITY IT'S UNCLEAR TO US

01:24:56.191 --> 01:25:01.663 region:rollup2
WHY A PORTION OF THE FUNNY COULD

01:24:57.459 --> 01:25:02.331 region:rollup2
NOT BE DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:04.433 region:rollup2

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.375 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT EFFECT I

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:14.142 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE.

DEVELOP A WEB PORTAL I THINK

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:17.980 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE. SEPARATE FROM

01:25:16.378 --> 01:25:20.382 region:rollup2
THE THE MONEY THAT'S GOING INTO

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:21.650 region:rollup2

ABOUT THEM IN THE SAME

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:26.254 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I ABSOLUTELY AGREE

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:28.490 region:rollup2

THAT. WHAT WAS THERE PLUS WHAT'S

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:34.329 region:rollup2
BEEN ADDED AND DECIDE WE'RE

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.897 region:rollup2
GOING TO SPEND THAT ON A WEB

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:37.866 region:rollup2
PORTAL THAT COULD EAT UP THE

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:40.535 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:42.304 region:rollup2
USE? FOR THAT.

SO IN IN LINES.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.378 region:rollup2
I'M BACK AGAIN ASKING SOME OF

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:57.446 region:rollup2
THE SAME THINGS ASK FOR LAST

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:58.814 region:rollup2
YEAR I DO APPRECIATE THIS

01:26:57.446 --> 01:27:00.882 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:26:58.814 --> 01:27:02.951 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSING ON ACCESS TO

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:04.686 region:rollup2
JUSTICE IS AS.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:07.155 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PRESENTED.

01:27:04.686 --> 01:27:09.558 region:rollup2
THAT PART OF MY A ASK IS LOOKING

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:10.959 region:rollup2
AT THE SELF HELP FUNDING WHICH

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:13.662 region:rollup2
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT. HOW THE

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:15.363 region:rollup2
TWO ASPECTS OF IT AGAIN FROM

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:17.766 region:rollup2
ASKING THAT WE REQUIRE COURT

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:19.768 region:rollup2
REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW COURT?

01:27:17.766 --> 01:27:22.037 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FAMILY LAW

01:27:19.768 --> 01:27:23.238 region:rollup2
ARE PRIMARILY SELF REPRESENTED

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:24.973 region:rollup2
LITIGANTS AND WITHOUT HAVING A

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:27.476 region:rollup2
RECORD IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:28.543 region:rollup2
NOT IMPOSSIBLE. TO APPEAL OR

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:30.345 region:rollup2
REALLY TO EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:31.847 region:rollup2
THOSE DECISIONS WORK AND I THINK

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:33.248 region:rollup2
IT'S PART OF OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:34.783 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE AN

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:36.384 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE RECORD IN FAMILY LAW

01:27:34.783 --> 01:27:39.187 region:rollup2
COURT AND I WOULD LIKE. THIS

01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:40.589 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND THAT WE

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:42.791 region:rollup2
FUND FULLY FUNDS

01:27:40.589 --> 01:27:44.760 region:rollup2
AT LEAST IN FAMILY LAW COURT

01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:46.561 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT WE HAVE.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.130 region:rollup2
COURT REPORTERS

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:49.998 region:rollup2
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT'S

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.032 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO ACCESS TO

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:52.200 region:rollup2
JUSTICE.

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:53.602 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE THAT I WOULD LIKE

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.170 region:rollup2
TO ASK IS THAT WE INCREASE THE

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:57.339 region:rollup2
EQUAL ACCESS FUNDING.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:59.875 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:27:57.339 --> 01:28:01.743 region:rollup2
GETTING A TEN MILLION DOLLAR.

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:04.412 region:rollup2
OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD EQUAL

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:05.480 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO TO JUSTICE FUNDING.

BE NOW MADE PERMANENT SO THAT WE

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:12.721 region:rollup2
HAVE OUR OWN GOING GUARANTEE OF

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:14.022 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS.

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:15.957 region:rollup2
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:17.325 region:rollup2

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:20.629 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:22.597 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STARTING TO

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:24.466 region:rollup2

ACCESS TO JUSTICE.

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:40.315 region:rollup2

WITH SELF HELP CENTERS AND

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.151 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:44.553 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THOSE

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.053 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS OUT THERE WHO ARE

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:46.555 region:rollup2

WHERE WHERE ARE AT WERE NOT

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:13.361 region:rollup2
OPPOSED TO THE?

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:14.729 region:rollup2
ELLIOTT'S RECOMMENDATION TO

01:42:13.361 --> 01:42:16.163 region:rollup2
REASSESS THE PROGRAM BEFORE ANY

01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:17.264 region:rollup2
FUTURE PROJECTS ARE RECOMMENDED

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.966 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WILL

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:20.067 region:rollup2
TAKE TIME AND MONEY. ANDWE

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.402 region:rollup2
STILL BELIEVE THAT THE TEN THAT

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:23.104 region:rollup2
ARE PROPOSAL BEFORE WOULD STILL

01:42:21.402 --> 01:42:25.339 region:rollup2
BE THE TEN THAT WERE PROPOSED

01:42:23.104 --> 01:42:26.407 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE CRITERIA THAT. PUT

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:28.409 region:rollup2
THEM ON THE IMMEDIATE CRITICAL

01:42:26.407 --> 01:42:29.977 region:rollup2
NEEDS LESS TEN YEARS AGO ARE

01:42:28.409 --> 01:42:31.879 region:rollup2
STILL THERE AND IF ANYTHING THE.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.580 region:rollup2
A BILL THAT'S OF CONTINUE TO

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.547 region:rollup2
DETERIORATE.

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:35.282 region:rollup2
A WORLD WHERE THE DECLINING

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:37.051 region:rollup2
REVENUE SITUATION ON THE SPECIAL

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:38.119 region:rollup2
FUNDS WHICH SAYS SUPPORT THE

01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:38.786 region:rollup2
LEASE REVENUE PAYMENTS ON THE

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:40.621 region:rollup2
CURRENT.

01:42:38.786 --> 01:42:41.722 region:rollup2
BONTA HAVE ALREADY BEEN SOLD

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:43.524 region:rollup2
AND IT'S FOR THAT REASON THAT WE

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:45.092 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND AT THE GENERAL FUND BE

01:42:43.524 --> 01:42:46.494 region:rollup2
THE SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE OF

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:48.462 region:rollup2
THE SEVEN ABOUT PROPOSED IN THE

01:42:46.494 --> 01:42:50.931 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WOULD THINK

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:53.067 region:rollup2
IT'S PREMATURE TO REDIRECT THE

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:54.435 region:rollup2
FUNDS FROM. A SPECIAL FUNDS TO

01:42:53.067 --> 01:42:56.337 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND AZEGLIO HAS

01:42:54.435 --> 01:42:58.205 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED BECAUSE EVEN WITH

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:59.507 region:rollup2
DECLINING REVENUES THOSE. FUNDS

01:42:58.205 --> 01:43:01.075 region:rollup2
ARE SCHEDULED TO BE.

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:02.843 region:rollup2
SOLVENT FOR THE NEAR TERM

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:05.246 region:rollup2
FUTURE AND WE CONTINUE TO

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:06.080 region:rollup2
MONITOR MONITOR THOSE FUNDS ON

01:43:05.246 --> 01:43:07.581 region:rollup2

FUTURE PROJECTS WERE REQUESTED

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.621 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD DIE IF I

01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.156 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE AT THAT TIME WITH

01:43:13.621 --> 01:43:17.525 region:rollup2
WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES AND

01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:19.093 region:rollup2

01:43:27.268 --> 01:43:29.970 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF

AN OVERVIEW OF THE TRIAL COURT

CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. AND SO

01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:36.610 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:37.545 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED TO

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:39.413 region:rollup2
THE STATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:40.481 region:rollup2
TWO AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS

01:43:39.413 --> 01:43:42.216 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED SIGNIFICANT

01:43:40.481 --> 01:43:43.184 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN THE ASSESSMENT

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:44.852 region:rollup2
SELECTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF

01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:46.220 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS.

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:47.988 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TWO ACCOUNTS THAT

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:50.658 region:rollup2
WERE CREATED TO SUPPORT THESE

01:43:47.988 --> 01:43:52.393 region:rollup2
EFFORTS ON THEIR BOTH FUNDED BY

01:43:50.658 --> 01:43:54.128 region:rollup2
INCREASED BUT CIVIL AND CRIMINAL

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:55.096 region:rollup2
FINE IF YOU REVENUES.

01:43:54.128 --> 01:43:56.030 region:rollup2
AND THE TWO ACCOUNTS OF THE

01:43:55.096 --> 01:43:57.598 region:rollup2
STATE COURT FACILITIES

01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:59.467 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION FUND AS CFCF

01:43:57.598 --> 01:44:00.735 region:rollup2
CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO.

01:43:59.467 --> 01:44:02.169 region:rollup2
AND A MEDIA CRITICAL NEEDS

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:04.004 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT CREATED AND.

01:44:02.169 --> 01:44:05.506 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT OF

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:07.208 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR NOTE RELATED TO

01:44:05.506 --> 01:44:08.275 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS

01:44:07.208 --> 01:44:09.710 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROHIBITED FROM

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:11.579 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZING ANY.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.681 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES THAT THE FUNDS

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:14.949 region:rollup2
COULD NOT SUPPORT.

01:44:13.681 --> 01:44:16.383 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF

01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:18.085 region:rollup2
YOUR HAND OUT.

01:44:16.383 --> 01:44:19.787 region:rollup2
THERE IS A LACK OF REVENUE AND

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:21.188 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THE ACCOUNTS AND THIS IS

01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:23.624 region:rollup2
REALLY FOR TWO REASONS.

01:44:21.188 --> 01:44:25.326 region:rollup2
FIRST AS SHOWN BEFORE YOU ON IN

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:27.061 region:rollup2
THE TABLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:44:25.326 --> 01:44:28.462 region:rollup2
NINE TEN A TOTAL OF ONE POINT

01:44:27.061 --> 01:44:30.030 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLION HAS BEEN RE

01:44:28.462 --> 01:44:30.931 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO EITHER THE GENERAL

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:32.600 region:rollup2
FUND OR TO TRIAL COURT

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:34.502 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND THIS GENERALLY

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.137 region:rollup2
COINCIDED TO MITIGATE THE

01:44:34.502 --> 01:44:37.972 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF THE FISCAL DOWNTURN.

01:44:36.137 --> 01:44:39.640 region:rollup2
TO DATE CURRENTLY FIFTY FIVE

01:44:37.972 --> 01:44:40.241 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE MILLION CONTINUES TO

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:42.143 region:rollup2
BE TRANSFERRED TO TRIAL COURT

01:44:40.241 --> 01:44:43.711 region:rollup2
OPERATION.

01:44:42.143 --> 01:44:44.945 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE AMOUNT OF

01:44:43.711 --> 01:44:46.714 region:rollup2
REVENUE THAT'S DEPOSITED INTO

01:44:44.945 --> 01:44:49.416 region:rollup2
THESE ACCOUNTS HAVE STEADILY

01:44:46.714 --> 01:44:50.951 region:rollup2
DECLINED OVER THE PAST DECADE.

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:52.953 region:rollup2
SO THIS LACK OF REVENUE THEN

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:54.155 region:rollup2
LEADS TO TWO MAJOR PROBLEMS IF

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:55.756 region:rollup2
YOU TURN TO PAGES AND FOUR OF

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:56.891 region:rollup2
YOUR HAND OUT.

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:58.425 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THERE

01:44:56.891 --> 01:44:59.894 region:rollup2
IS AN INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO

01:44:58.425 --> 01:45:01.896 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE PLANNED PROJECTS.

01:44:59.894 --> 01:45:03.130 region:rollup2
AS OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

01:45:01.896 --> 01:45:05.866 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED

01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:07.902 region:rollup2
FROM FC FCF HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:09.803 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OUT OF THE FORTY ONE

01:45:07.902 --> 01:45:11.872 region:rollup2
PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED FROM AETNA

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:13.607 region:rollup2
ONLY TWELVE HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:15.976 region:rollup2
TEAM ARE ON HOLD AND ELEVEN ARE

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:17.645 region:rollup2
INDEFINITELY DELAYED.

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:19.213 region:rollup2
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR

01:45:17.645 --> 01:45:20.347 region:rollup2
HAND OUT THE SECOND MAJOR

01:45:19.213 --> 01:45:22.016 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:23.517 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT

01:45:22.016 --> 01:45:25.653 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT OBLIGATIONS.

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:27.388 region:rollup2
THE FOR EXAMPLE THE S. CFCF IN

01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:29.056 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS ESTIMATED

01:45:27.388 --> 01:45:30.024 region:rollup2
TO HAVE ONGOING EXPENDITURES A

01:45:29.056 --> 01:45:31.425 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION

01:45:30.024 --> 01:45:33.360 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:34.495 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN EIGHTY SIX MILLION

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.930 region:rollup2
IN PROJECTED REVENUE LOSS.

01:45:34.495 --> 01:45:37.231 region:rollup2
SO BOTH OF THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:38.465 region:rollup2
FUNDING THESE ONGOING

01:45:37.231 --> 01:45:40.234 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES BY DRAWING DOWN

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:41.502 region:rollup2
THERE FUND BALANCES AND BOTH

01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:42.436 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE LESS EXPECTED TO

01:45:41.502 --> 01:45:44.772 region:rollup2
BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE NEXT FEW

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:45.406 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:45:44.772 --> 01:45:47.908 region:rollup2
ABSENT ANY CHANGES AND REVENUES

01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:49.210 region:rollup2
ARE EXPENDITURES.

01:45:47.908 --> 01:45:50.144 region:rollup2
TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND

01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:51.478 region:rollup2
OUT I THINK THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

01:45:50.144 --> 01:45:53.681 region:rollup2
OF A GOOD JOB KIND OF

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:54.849 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZING THE PROPOSAL IT IS

01:45:53.681 --> 01:45:56.684 region:rollup2
ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:58.052 region:rollup2
IN LEASE REVENUE BONDS BACKED BY

01:45:56.684 --> 01:45:59.587 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND. INSTEAD OF

01:45:58.052 --> 01:46:01.155 region:rollup2
AETNA IF YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE

01:45:59.587 --> 01:46:03.357 region:rollup2
BEFORE YOU ON THE RIGHT HAND

01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:04.625 region:rollup2
SIDE THIS WILL MEAN ANNUAL THAT

01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:05.826 region:rollup2
SERVICE OF A HUNDRED AND TWO

01:46:04.625 --> 01:46:08.529 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR

01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:09.730 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:11.565 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN OF

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.333 region:rollup2
YOUR HAND OUT.

01:46:11.565 --> 01:46:13.601 region:rollup2
WE GENERALLY FIND THAT THE

01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:14.168 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS A

01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:21.075 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AS EFFECTIVELY IN

01:46:14.168 --> 01:46:22.676 region:rollup2
USED TO FINANCE PROJECTS.

01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:23.777 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHILE THAT PROJECTS THAT

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:25.779 region:rollup2
ARE SELECTED ARE THE CLOSEST TO

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:27.348 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION IT IS UNCLEAR TO US

01:46:25.779 --> 01:46:28.782 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY REPRESENT THOSE

01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:32.119 region:rollup2
THAT OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. IN

01:46:28.782 --> 01:46:33.721 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:35.823 region:rollup2
SELECTED AND IT'S FAST ABOUT A

01:46:33.721 --> 01:46:36.390 region:rollup2
DECADE AGO AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:46:35.823 --> 01:46:37.725 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE SELECTED DIFFERENT

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.359 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IF THEY WERE INVOLVED

01:46:37.725 --> 01:46:39.727 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS.

01:46:38.359 --> 01:46:40.561 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONCERNED

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:42.463 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:46:40.561 --> 01:46:44.365 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE A LONG

01:46:42.463 --> 01:46:47.768 region:rollup2
TERM SOLUTION TO ADDRESS KEY

01:46:44.365 --> 01:46:48.669 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS FACING THE SYSTEM. ONE

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:50.571 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUED DECLINE AND FINING

01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:52.106 region:rollup2
FEE REVENUE. THE FACT THAT THERE

01:46:50.571 --> 01:46:52.873 region:rollup2
IS INSUFFICIENT SECONDS THE FACT

01:46:52.106 --> 01:46:54.375 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:56.143 region:rollup2
REVENUE TO MEET EXISTING

01:46:54.375 --> 01:46:57.878 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS WHICH CAN MEAN THAT

01:46:56.143 --> 01:46:59.380 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND MAY NEED TO

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:01.148 region:rollup2
PROVIDE NINETY TO A HUNDRED AND

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:02.683 region:rollup2
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:03.250 region:rollup2
FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:47:02.683 --> 01:47:04.918 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ON TOP OF THE

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:06.420 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:47:04.918 --> 01:47:08.822 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THAT THERE IS NO

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:10.424 region:rollup2
CLEAR PLAN FOR HOW FUTURE

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:12.226 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WILL BE FUNDED WILL BE

01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:13.861 region:rollup2
FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR. FROM

01:47:12.226 --> 01:47:16.430 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS WHEN

01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:18.899 region:rollup2
THERE'S AVAILABLE FUNDING.

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:20.901 region:rollup2
SO TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS ANA

01:47:18.899 --> 01:47:23.737 region:rollup2
ONGOING BASIS WE ACTUALLY

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:24.505 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND OVERHAULING THE.

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:26.106 region:rollup2
AND OUR RECOMMENDATION HAS FOUR

01:47:24.505 --> 01:47:27.641 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS.

01:47:26.106 --> 01:47:29.143 region:rollup2
WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING THE

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:30.544 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR TROPPER PROJECTS

01:47:29.143 --> 01:47:32.112 region:rollup2
CURRENT AND FUTURE ONES TO THE

01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:33.113 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:34.581 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT PROJECTS

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:35.749 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD BASED ON

01:47:34.581 --> 01:47:37.217 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES RATHER

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:39.086 region:rollup2
THAN HOW MUCH FUNDING WAS

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:40.220 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IN IN THESE ACCOUNTS.

01:47:39.086 --> 01:47:41.922 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:43.057 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WAS CLEARLY AWARE OF

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:43.924 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND

01:47:43.057 --> 01:47:45.259 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION THAT WOULD BE

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:47.227 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO MOVE THAT PROJECT

01:47:45.259 --> 01:47:49.430 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:50.631 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE THEN RECOMMEND

01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:51.899 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THE REVENUES THAT WOULD

01:47:50.631 --> 01:47:53.667 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO THE

01:47:51.899 --> 01:47:54.568 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS TO MOVED

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:55.869 region:rollup2
OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:56.937 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL AVAILABLE TO

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:58.939 region:rollup2
PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DEBT

01:47:56.937 --> 01:48:00.574 region:rollup2
SERVICE THAT WAS SHIFTED.

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:02.009 region:rollup2
THIRD WE RECOMMEND SHIFTING THE

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:03.577 region:rollup2
NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED

01:48:02.009 --> 01:48:04.611 region:rollup2
EXPENSES OVER AND APPROPRIATING

01:48:03.577 --> 01:48:06.246 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION

01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:08.248 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:09.650 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THOSE SERVICE LEVELS.

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:11.418 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY FOR ANY FUTURE

01:48:09.650 --> 01:48:12.219 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WE RECOMMEND THAT THEY

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:13.721 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD BASED ON

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:15.289 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND AND

01:48:13.721 --> 01:48:16.323 region:rollup2
HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE

01:48:15.289 --> 01:48:18.092 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE PROJECTS WOULD BE WE

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:21.061 region:rollup2
DO RECOMMEND A REASSESSMENT OF

01:48:18.092 --> 01:48:21.729 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:23.430 region:rollup2
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE OF YOUR

01:48:21.729 --> 01:48:25.332 region:rollup2
HAND OUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:27.501 region:rollup2
NOT INTERESTED AND OVERHAULING

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:28.702 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM. WE DO RECOMMEND

01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:30.504 region:rollup2
MODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:32.139 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AND FIVE WAYS TO AT

01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:33.440 region:rollup2
LEAST MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENT.

01:48:32.139 --> 01:48:34.808 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST IS TO CONSOLIDATE

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:36.276 region:rollup2
THE TWO ACCOUNTS TO ENSURE THAT

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:37.845 region:rollup2
NO PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD UNLESS

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:39.346 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT TOTAL REVENUE

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:40.681 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THEM. AS THIS COULD

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:42.182 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY REDUCE GENERAL FUND

01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:43.550 region:rollup2
BACKFILL THAT'S NEEDED IN THE

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:46.420 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:47.721 region:rollup2
SECONDS WE RECOMMEND TERMINATING

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:49.390 region:rollup2
THE ANNUAL FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:51.058 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER FROM THE

01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:53.060 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS

01:48:51.058 --> 01:48:54.595 region:rollup2
TO TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS AND

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:55.763 region:rollup2
INSTEAD PROVIDE THE ROUTE THOSE

01:48:54.595 --> 01:48:56.964 region:rollup2
RESOURCES FROM THE GENERAL FUND

01:48:55.763 --> 01:48:59.566 region:rollup2
INSTEAD.

01:48:56.964 --> 01:49:01.034 region:rollup2
THIRD WE RECOMMEND TRANSFERRING

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:02.202 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION

01:49:01.034 --> 01:49:03.504 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR TWENTY FIVE

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.938 region:rollup2
YEARS WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:49:03.504 --> 01:49:06.039 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FROM

01:49:04.938 --> 01:49:07.741 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL FUND TO THE

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:09.343 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNT.

01:49:07.741 --> 01:49:11.145 region:rollup2
BUT REQUIRE THAT JUDICIAL

01:49:09.343 --> 01:49:12.946 region:rollup2
COUNCIL ADDRESS ANY EXISTING

01:49:11.145 --> 01:49:14.281 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS BEFORE ANY NEW

01:49:12.946 --> 01:49:15.549 region:rollup2
PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD WE DO

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:16.984 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WOULD BE

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:18.519 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR HOW MANY NEW PROJECTS

01:49:16.984 --> 01:49:20.521 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:49:18.519 --> 01:49:21.822 region:rollup2
FOURTH WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:23.424 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL

01:49:21.822 --> 01:49:24.758 region:rollup2
COUNCIL TO SUBMIT A LONG TERM

01:49:23.424 --> 01:49:26.794 region:rollup2
FUND CONDITION STATEMENT WITH

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:28.028 region:rollup2
ANY FUTURE FUNDING REQUEST TO

01:49:26.794 --> 01:49:29.496 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY'RE

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:30.998 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO MEET

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:32.599 region:rollup2
EXISTING OBLIGATIONS IN ADDITION

01:49:30.998 --> 01:49:34.101 region:rollup2
TO ANY NEW ONES.

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:34.802 region:rollup2
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE

01:49:34.101 --> 01:49:37.104 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND.

01:49:34.802 --> 01:49:38.372 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT JUDICIAL

01:49:37.104 --> 01:49:39.706 region:rollup2
COUNCIL TO REASSESS THE

01:49:38.372 --> 01:49:40.507 region:rollup2
PROJECT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:41.775 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE OF

01:49:40.507 --> 01:49:47.047 region:rollup2
HIGHEST PRIORITY ARE ACCURATELY

01:49:41.775 --> 01:49:52.853 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:54.188 region:rollup2
ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE.

01:49:52.853 --> 01:49:55.722 region:rollup2

CONSTRUCTION.

01:50:04.064 --> 01:50:08.368 region:rollup2
THE REASONS OBVIOUSLY ARE.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.104 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE IMPORTANT ACCESS

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:11.705 region:rollup2
TO JUSTICE FOR COURT USERS BUT

01:50:10.104 --> 01:50:13.073 region:rollup2
ALSO IT'S IN RECOGNITION. OF THE

INTERACT

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.778 region:rollup2
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE ARE

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:18.679 region:rollup2
LOTS OF COUNTIES FUNCTIONS THAT

01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:20.180 region:rollup2
ARE DEPENDENT.

01:50:18.679 --> 01:50:21.982 region:rollup2
OR INTERTWINED WITH THE COURT

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:23.317 region:rollup2

COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS HOME.

THANK YOU OPEN ARM.

01:50:38.832 --> 01:50:43.003 region:rollup2

IN MY WHEELHOUSE RIGHT ABOUT

01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:47.941 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.575 region:rollup2
I MISSED A FORMER DIRECTOR

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:50.410 region:rollup2
RELEASED A FOR THE CITY OF LOS

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:52.679 region:rollup2
ANGELES AND VERY FAMILIAR FOR

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:53.647 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WITH THE DEUKMEJIAN LAW

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:55.182 region:rollup2
BEACH COURTHOUSE.

01:50:53.647 --> 01:50:56.750 region:rollup2
AND THE COST OF BUILDING THAT

01:50:55.182 --> 01:50:58.619 region:rollup2
I'M VERY CONCERNED.

01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:00.420 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY.

01:50:58.619 --> 01:51:01.088 region:rollup2
WE'RE SPENDING NOW NOT ONLY NOW

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.356 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:51:01.088 --> 01:51:04.691 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE GOING UP.

01:51:02.356 --> 01:51:05.993 region:rollup2
AND IF FOR.

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.261 region:rollup2
SIGH WE WERE GOING TO TRADE WAR

01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:08.428 region:rollup2
WHICH CERTAIN COUNTRIES IT COULD

01:51:07.261 --> 01:51:10.898 region:rollup2
GO UP EVEN MORE.

01:51:08.428 --> 01:51:14.268 region:rollup2
SO I SEE WE HAVE PROJECT EVER

01:51:10.898 --> 01:51:15.969 region:rollup2
INDEFINITELY DELAYED.

01:51:14.268 --> 01:51:16.937 region:rollup2
I I WROTE WILL ASSUME THAT MEANS

01:51:15.969 --> 01:51:19.373 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN WE GET AROUND TOO

01:51:16.937 --> 01:51:19.706 region:rollup2
LONG OR WHATEVER WE FIGURE OUT

01:51:19.373 --> 01:51:21.208 region:rollup2
WE GOT MONEY.

01:51:19.706 --> 01:51:23.277 region:rollup2
AND.

01:51:21.208 --> 01:51:25.012 region:rollup2
I'M I'M KIND OF LEANING TOWARD.

01:51:23.277 --> 01:51:27.614 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY OVERHAULING

01:51:25.012 --> 01:51:28.749 region:rollup2
BUT REEVALUATING EVERYTHING THAT

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:30.617 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO AND IN TRY TO FIGURE

01:51:28.749 --> 01:51:32.252 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT WE CAN DO. IT WE CAN'T

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:34.488 region:rollup2
DO ON WITH THE MONEY THAT WE

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:37.124 region:rollup2
HAVE. AND THEN DETERMINE WHETHER

01:51:34.488 --> 01:51:39.226 region:rollup2
OR NOT WE WANT TO GO FORWARD.

01:51:37.124 --> 01:51:39.693 region:rollup2
AND SO I AM I.

01:51:39.226 --> 01:51:41.094 region:rollup2
I'M GOING TO GET MORE

01:51:39.693 --> 01:51:44.231 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:45.365 region:rollup2
ON.

01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:46.733 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU MENTIONED THAT WOULD BE

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:48.135 region:rollup2
IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY GOING INTO

01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:49.269 region:rollup2
CERTAIN FUNDS.

01:51:48.135 --> 01:51:52.606 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FEELING THAT SOME OF

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:53.574 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS HAD INITIAL.

01:51:52.606 --> 01:51:55.275 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

01:51:53.574 --> 01:51:56.343 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TEN.

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:58.579 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD IMAGINE WE'VE BLOWN

01:51:56.343 --> 01:52:00.280 region:rollup2
THAT BUDGET.

01:51:58.579 --> 01:52:02.950 region:rollup2
WHAT WAY OVER THAT THEM IN MOST

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.251 region:rollup2
OF THAT FOR? CONSTRUCTION COSTS

01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:05.919 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER THING SO.

01:52:04.251 --> 01:52:07.921 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD EVEN IF YOU WANT A

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:09.756 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT WE NEED TO.

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:12.092 region:rollup2
TO REALLY LOOK AT THE.

01:52:09.756 --> 01:52:13.694 region:rollup2
THE RISING COSTS OF OF MATERIALS

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:15.095 region:rollup2
AND CONSTRUCTION AS WE MOVE

01:52:13.694 --> 01:52:17.297 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND SO I'M.

01:52:15.095 --> 01:52:19.233 region:rollup2
IF IF SOMEONE COULD COME IN MY

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:19.733 region:rollup2
OFFICE I WOULD LOVE TO.

01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:21.468 region:rollup2
GO OVER THESE FORTY TWO

01:52:19.733 --> 01:52:23.170 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:52:21.468 --> 01:52:25.405 region:rollup2
.

01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:27.107 region:rollup2
I'M ASSUMING SIXTEEN ARE HOLDERS

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.941 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN THAT WE HOPE. ONE DAY

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:30.143 region:rollup2
YOU WILL BE ABLE.

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:32.212 region:rollup2
TO DO.

01:52:30.143 --> 01:52:35.082 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE A CANCELED THREE.

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:36.617 region:rollup2
SO I.

01:52:35.082 --> 01:52:37.851 region:rollup2
THESE COURTHOUSES ARE REALLY

01:52:36.617 --> 01:52:38.952 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT GET THIS DONE.

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:40.387 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WORKING WITH THE

01:52:38.952 --> 01:52:42.689 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND

01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:43.957 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WORKING TOGETHER.

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:45.225 region:rollup2
THEN WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:46.360 region:rollup2
WITH PLAN THE OTHER THING OUT

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.494 region:rollup2
JUST

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:49.596 region:rollup2
LIVE WITH THAT AND IN THE CITY.

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:50.731 region:rollup2
.

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:52.199 region:rollup2
I BUILT SEVERAL POLICE STATION

01:52:50.731 --> 01:52:54.368 region:rollup2
FIRE STATIONS.

01:52:52.199 --> 01:52:56.536 region:rollup2
ON LIBRARIES.

01:52:54.368 --> 01:52:58.605 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE.

01:52:56.536 --> 01:53:00.774 region:rollup2
DECIDED NOT.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:01.742 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:53:00.774 --> 01:53:03.577 region:rollup2
BE THE PROJECT MANAGER ONLY

01:53:01.742 --> 01:53:05.512 region:rollup2
DECIDED NOT. TO HAVE THE FIRE

01:53:03.577 --> 01:53:07.180 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT BECOME THE PROJECT

01:53:05.512 --> 01:53:09.383 region:rollup2
MANAGER OR LIBRARIAN.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:11.184 region:rollup2
AND KIND OF LOOKED AT OUR COSTS

01:53:09.383 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
AND AND CON A CENTRALIZED

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:15.355 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING BUT MORE IMPORTANT

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.922 region:rollup2
HAVE STANDARDS FOR OFFICE SIDES.

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:16.590 region:rollup2
WE SAVED ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:17.791 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:18.759 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY WERE ABLE TO COME IN

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:21.161 region:rollup2
ON TIME.

01:53:18.759 --> 01:53:23.997 region:rollup2
AND UNDER BUDGET.

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:53:23.997 --> 01:53:27.134 region:rollup2
THE THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WENT

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:28.735 region:rollup2
INTO EACH OF THESE BECAUSE I

01:53:27.134 --> 01:53:30.637 region:rollup2
HAVE A FEELING. EACH ONE HE'S

01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:31.972 region:rollup2
BEEN TREATED YOU MEET.

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:33.507 region:rollup2
AND YOUR OWN WAY ON HOW THE HOW

01:53:31.972 --> 01:53:35.542 region:rollup2
THE BILL THIS AND.

01:53:33.507 --> 01:53:36.710 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT MAY BE PART OF

01:53:35.542 --> 01:53:38.345 region:rollup2
THE THE PROBLEM OF BUILDING WHEN

01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:38.812 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:53:38.345 --> 01:53:40.580 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:53:38.812 --> 01:53:42.315 region:rollup2
ENGINEERS.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.216 region:rollup2
WHO ARE OBJECTIVE LOOKING AT

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:44.084 region:rollup2
THESE PROJECTS AND MAKING

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:45.385 region:rollup2
DECISIONS?

01:53:44.084 --> 01:53:47.487 region:rollup2
NAM.

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:49.323 region:rollup2
CAN BE.

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:50.957 region:rollup2
CAN BE LOW PROBLEMATIC I

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:52.259 region:rollup2
REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:53.627 region:rollup2
I FIRST GOT HERE TWENTY TWELVE.

01:53:52.259 --> 01:53:55.329 region:rollup2
AND THEN I WAS TOLD THAT THE

01:53:53.627 --> 01:53:56.363 region:rollup2
JUDGE WAS IN CHARGE OF LOOKING

01:53:55.329 --> 01:53:58.231 region:rollup2
AT IT AND COMING UP WITH SOME

01:53:56.363 --> 01:53:59.466 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT

01:53:58.231 --> 01:54:01.301 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY MAY HAVE

01:53:59.466 --> 01:54:02.569 region:rollup2
BEEN WORK WHERE PROJECT MANAGER.

01:54:01.301 --> 01:54:04.504 region:rollup2

WITH LOT OF JUDGES HOA.

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:09.643 region:rollup2
I DON'T.

01:54:07.074 --> 01:54:10.844 region:rollup2
BELABORED ANYMORE BUT I WOULD.

01:54:09.643 --> 01:54:11.478 region:rollup2
LOW AND I KNOW WE'RE HOLE

01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:13.613 region:rollup2
HEDONISM HOLE. BUT I WOULD LOVE

01:54:11.478 --> 01:54:14.414 region:rollup2
TO.

01:54:13.613 --> 01:54:17.150 region:rollup2
WE GIVE SOME ADVICE SOME INPUT

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:19.553 region:rollup2
ON THIS.

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:21.121 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:54:19.553 --> 01:54:22.723 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND OBVIOUSLY OF

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:24.324 region:rollup2
THE ALLELES POSITION IS VERY

01:54:22.723 --> 01:54:25.525 region:rollup2
INTERESTING AND AND WE.

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:27.260 region:rollup2
MAY NEED TO LOOK AT IT MORE

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:28.528 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY IN TERMS OF.

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.629 region:rollup2
BLENDING THE RESOURCES TOGETHER

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:29.996 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND HOW

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:33.533 region:rollup2
IT'S FINANCED.

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:36.436 region:rollup2
.

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:37.304 region:rollup2
I WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE.

01:54:36.436 --> 01:54:38.872 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAT ARE RECOMMENDED THE

01:54:37.304 --> 01:54:40.240 region:rollup2
TEN COURT HOUSES THAT ARE

01:54:38.872 --> 01:54:42.109 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED WHERE THESE OUR

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.544 region:rollup2
HIGHEST PRIORITY IN TERMS OF

01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:45.846 region:rollup2
NEED IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW SPACE

01:54:44.544 --> 01:54:47.647 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW OR SOMETHING

01:54:45.846 --> 01:54:49.683 region:rollup2
FALLING APART WHATEVER I DON'T

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:51.485 region:rollup2
KNOW. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY'RE

01:54:49.683 --> 01:54:52.152 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT OUR HIGHEST

01:54:51.485 --> 01:54:55.288 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

01:54:52.152 --> 01:54:55.922 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:56.456 region:rollup2
I AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE THEY

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:57.657 region:rollup2
ARE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:58.892 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT BUT I

01:54:57.657 --> 01:55:00.160 region:rollup2
WOULD ADD IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

01:54:58.892 --> 01:55:01.461 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS OF EACH ONE OF THE

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:02.729 region:rollup2
COURTS I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE

01:55:01.461 --> 01:55:04.030 region:rollup2
OUT IF THIS IS.

01:55:02.729 --> 01:55:05.098 region:rollup2
IF THESE ARE HYPER HIGHEST

01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:06.800 region:rollup2
PRIORITY FOR CONSTRUCTION.

01:55:05.098 --> 01:55:08.769 region:rollup2
.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.736 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D I'D I'M INTERESTED

01:55:08.769 --> 01:55:12.105 region:rollup2
IN THAT I HATE TO MESS WITH THE

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:12.973 region:rollup2
LIST WITH I KNOW HOW THAT IS YOU

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:14.574 region:rollup2

COME LONG PUT ANOTHER LIST

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:24.351 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO. I I THINK IT WOULD

01:55:21.348 --> 01:55:25.285 region:rollup2
BE HELPFUL AND MAYBE YOU ALREADY

01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:26.486 region:rollup2
HAVE DECIDED THAT THESE ARE.

01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:27.320 region:rollup2
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY VERSUS

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:28.822 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT WERE ALREADY IN LINE

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.756 region:rollup2

KNOW I MEAN.

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:33.326 region:rollup2
SWEET A WILD GUESS SINCE THINGS

HAVE TAKEN PLACE I KNOW

01:55:33.326 --> 01:55:35.328 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IT IS TO GIVE NEW

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:36.863 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSE ENABLE JUST GOT A NEW

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:38.965 region:rollup2
ONE. AND I KNOW IMPORTANT AND

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:40.100 region:rollup2
HOW IT GOOD IT FEELS OF EVEN THE

01:55:38.965 --> 01:55:41.201 region:rollup2
WE DON'T KNOW WHY WE GOT IT

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:44.304 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING HAPPEN

01:55:41.201 --> 01:55:44.838 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE WE. END UP GETTING

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:46.940 region:rollup2
IT BASED ON SOME.

01:55:44.838 --> 01:55:48.608 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT EXISTED IN THE OLD

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:49.443 region:rollup2
COURTHOUSE I I DON'T WANT TO GO

KNOWING WHETHER NOT THESE TWO

01:55:51.945 --> 01:55:54.915 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY RANK WITH OTHERS OF

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:56.583 region:rollup2
OTHERS SO. IF WE'VE GOT THESE

01:55:54.915 --> 01:55:59.019 region:rollup2
OTHER FOLKS KIND OF THE SIXTEEN

01:55:56.583 --> 01:56:00.754 region:rollup2
HANG OUT HERE HOW DO THEY FIT

01:55:59.019 --> 01:56:01.488 region:rollup2
PLAN AND THIS IS REALLY

01:56:00.754 --> 01:56:05.258 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING.

01:56:01.488 --> 01:56:05.559 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE NEED THAT WE THAT

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.259 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO.

01:56:05.559 --> 01:56:08.128 region:rollup2
.

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:09.863 region:rollup2
BASICALLY PROVIDE JUSTICE FAIR

01:56:08.128 --> 01:56:11.164 region:rollup2
IN AND CONDITIONS WORKING

I DON'T KNOW.

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:17.537 region:rollup2
.

01:56:15.769 --> 01:56:19.372 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANY ASSESSMENT DONE OF

01:56:17.537 --> 01:56:21.441 region:rollup2
THESE TEN PROJECTS BUT PROGRAM

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:22.542 region:rollup2
ACCORDING UNJUST THERE WAS OKAY

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:24.044 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:25.779 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE STILL

01:56:24.044 --> 01:56:28.014 region:rollup2
VALID TODAY THE REST FOUR

01:56:25.779 --> 01:56:29.416 region:rollup2
CRITERIA. THAT ALL THE PROJECTS

01:56:28.014 --> 01:56:31.818 region:rollup2
WERE PRIORITIZE WITH THE

01:56:35.856 --> 01:56:39.125 region:rollup2
FROM THE COURT STAFF. OF

REDUCING OVERCROWDING COMMITS A

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:42.696 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF THE ACTUAL SPACE IN

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:44.297 region:rollup2
ACCORDANCE COMPARED TO OUR

01:56:42.696 --> 01:56:46.333 region:rollup2
DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR EACH

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:47.367 region:rollup2
ELEMENT THAT A COURTHOUSE IS

01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:48.902 region:rollup2
MADE UP OF.

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:50.337 region:rollup2
CORRECTING THE PHYSICAL HAZARDS

01:56:48.902 --> 01:56:52.572 region:rollup2
IN THE BUILDINGS

01:56:50.337 --> 01:56:54.841 region:rollup2
WHICH INCLUDES FIRE.

01:56:52.572 --> 01:56:56.476 region:rollup2
LIFE SAFETY ACCESSIBILITY

01:56:54.841 --> 01:56:58.144 region:rollup2

CONDITION OF THE BUILDING ITSELF

01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:00.947 region:rollup2
PROOF MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT

01:56:59.546 --> 01:57:02.516 region:rollup2
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT.

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:04.150 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY IMPROVING THE

01:57:02.516 --> 01:57:06.052 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO COURTS SERVICES WHICH

01:57:04.150 --> 01:57:08.588 region:rollup2
IS AN ASSESSMENT.

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:09.923 region:rollup2
OF OF THE ACTUAL WORKLOAD ACTUAL

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:11.258 region:rollup2
JUDGESHIPS IN THAT PARTICULAR

01:57:09.923 --> 01:57:13.026 region:rollup2
COURT.

01:57:11.258 --> 01:57:15.328 region:rollup2
HONG AGAINST A FORECAST OF WHAT

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:15.962 region:rollup2
THAT WORKLOAD AND FORECAST WHAT

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:17.330 region:rollup2

COURT.

01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:20.734 region:rollup2
SO THOSE CRITERIA WERE WERE EACH

01:57:19.566 --> 01:57:23.470 region:rollup2
OR THE FIVE POINT SYSTEM

01:57:20.734 --> 01:57:24.504 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED WITH EACH OF THOSE

01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:26.539 region:rollup2
FOUR RIGHT TO ARM.

01:57:24.504 --> 01:57:28.174 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS BEING EQUALLY TREATED.

01:57:26.539 --> 01:57:29.409 region:rollup2
THE HIGHER YOUR SCORE WAS THE

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:30.510 region:rollup2
HIGHER YOU WERE ON THE LIST FOR

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:32.913 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT.

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:34.581 region:rollup2
ALL THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE IN

01:57:32.913 --> 01:57:35.548 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET TODAY AS PROPOSED OR

EITHER LISTED AS A MEDIA OR

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:40.053 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:41.588 region:rollup2
AND AND WE DID REASSESS THAT.

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:42.622 region:rollup2
QUICKLY HERE JUST AS THE BUDGET

01:57:41.588 --> 01:57:43.423 region:rollup2
WAS BEING PROPOSED AND DETERMINE

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:45.425 region:rollup2
IT'S STILL THE SAME.

ADDITIONALLY.

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:49.396 region:rollup2
FIVE OF THOSE PROJECTS

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:50.564 region:rollup2
ARE COMPLETELY DESIGN.

01:57:49.396 --> 01:57:52.065 region:rollup2
ALL THE A WE HAVE ALL THE

APPROVALS TO CONSTRUCT CLOSE

01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:54.000 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE WERE ACTUALLY IN

01:57:53.033 --> 01:57:54.401 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET TWO YEARS AGO WHEN

01:57:57.470 --> 01:58:00.607 region:rollup2
FUNDING CONDITION OF THE EGGMAN

A REQUIRED US TO STOP THEM.

01:58:00.607 --> 01:58:04.210 region:rollup2
OKAY COUPLE THESE WHAT ARE TO BE

01:58:01.908 --> 01:58:05.679 region:rollup2
DONE OR NEARLY COMPLETELY HAD WE

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:08.114 region:rollup2
NOT HAD THE FUND.

01:58:05.679 --> 01:58:09.082 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH THE ACCOUNT WHICH
