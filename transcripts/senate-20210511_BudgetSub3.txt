OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES. THIS IS TO REPLACE THE EXISTING CHILD WELFARE SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THE EXISTING SYSTEM WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN IS USED BY COUNTY AND STATE STAFF TO SERVE A PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND NO LONGER SUPPORTS CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS REGULATIONS OR POLICIES. THE CARRIAGE PROJECT ORIGINALLY FOCUSED ON A CUSTOM DEVELOPMENT BUT IT SAYS UPDATED APPROACH DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME I WAS CHECKING THE BILL THE SYSTEM. THE PROJECT UPDATED TO CONFIGURE AN EMPLOYEE. USING WHAT IS CALLED THE- ASISTIR WHICH IS. A VENDOR MANAGED PLATFORM ON USING- AN EXISTING VENDORS. REAL MANAGEMENT. AND DEVELOP TOOLS TO BUILD THE CORK SPUN. THIS WILL ALLOW THE PROJECT TO FOCUS MORE ON THE CORE BUSINESS NEEDS RATHER THAN MAINTAINING. AND DEVELOPING A CUSTOM PLATFORM. I'M WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THE PROJECT IS EXECUTED THE PRIMARY SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT VENDOR CONTRACTS AND HAS BEGUN THE DESIGN THE END DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STATES. THIS BASICALLY REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL COUNTY AND VENDOR RESOURCES WELL THAT OCCURS PROJECT TO CONTINUE THESE DEMAND I ACTIVITIES. REPLACE THE EXISTING SYSTEM. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. OR IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO GET INTO FURTHER DETAIL IN SOME AREAS- WELL I GUESS JUST WITH NY IT PROJECT WE'RE TAKING ON IT AS A AS A MEANS OF STREAMLINING AND IMPROVING- WHAT KIND OF CHECKS AND REPORTING BACK TO LEGISLATURE WILL YOU HAVE.

AS WELL AS OUR- REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES TO SENIOR TEAM WITH REGARDS TO THEIR OVERSIGHT OF OUR PROJECT. DOCUMENT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I ALSO APPRECIATE THE RIGHT UP I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT- THIS IS A- REQUEST FOR A HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT. RIGHT FIVE MILLION- FOOT SIXTY EIGHT IS GENERAL FUND SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY A- SOME CERTAINLY AWESOME SOMEWHAT SUBSTANTIVE REQUEST- SO JUST A FEW THE FIRST OF ALL I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT I KNOW THAT FASTER. AND FOR LAST YEAR WITH COACH AND WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OVER- THAT- IT PROJECTS- THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE PAST AND- BUT- OKAY I JUST WANT I GUESS ONE QUESTION IS THAT- SO IS THIS PART OF THE- LARGER- I. T. PROJECT WE'RE DOING WITH. THE VARIOUS STATE. THAT VARIOUS COUNTIES AND SO FORTH IS THIS AN AERATION OF THIS. WE WERE DOING WE GET THIS SORT OF LARGE INTEGRATIVE PROCESS PROJECT THAT WAS YOU KNOW INVOLVING COUNTY INS NO D. S. YACHT THE PARCEL SERVICE AND SO FORTH THAT. I BELIEVE AT LEAST THE LAST TIME WE HEARD THE TIMELINE WAS TO TRY TO COMPLETE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS THIS A IS THIS A PIECE OF THAT PROJECT OR IS THIS THAT PROJECT WE'RE TALKING. IT IS THAT PROJECTS THAT PROJECT OKAY ALL RIGHT IN NINETEEN YOU TO SPEAK TO THE ROLE OF SALES FORCE I KNOW YOU SAID DOES THE PLATFORM AS A SERVICE- AND EXACTLY WHAT IS THE ON GOING COSTS TO THE STATE OF USING SALES FORCE- SO IT. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE THE BUILDING ON THEIR PLATFORM AND THAT THAT'S FINE IT'S GREAT TO BE A LEVERAGE BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE EXPECT I MEAN WHAT'S THE CONTRACT. SALES FORCE INVOLVED. ARAMBULA CONTRACTORS THERE'S- FORCES AND THEN- THERE. SUPPORT TO ASSIST US WE DEVELOPING ON THEIR CLASS. THEY MADE. THAT THAT. WILL USING FOR COURT- SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN SOME THAT'S TO GET IT STAGES AS TO. HOW MUCH OF THE TIME. WILL BE USING WAS FORCE. AND SO WE DO. WITH G. ON- ON. A WORK CELLS ACCORDING TO LICENSE WHAT'S UP KNOW WITH WHAT'S THE PRO. NUMBER IN THAT WE BUILD OUT AND OUT. AND- AS- LEARN BIT MORE. SPECIFIC FONG SPECIFIC- WHICH THEN WILL BE A TO HAVE BETTER. OUR. LONGER TERM WITH YOUR TO THE NUMBER USERS. OKAY PUT IS THERE A ROUGH ESTIMATE IS TO THE CENTRAL BUILDING THIS ON THIS FIVE AND AGAIN AND THAT'S THAT'S OF YOU KNOW BAD I. BUT WHAT WHAT IS THE GOING BECAUSE THEM. I REALIZE MEDIA THE NUMBER LIE SO BUT REALIZED CERTAINLY THAT ROUGH ESTIMATE OR RAIN OF. WELL IT YOU KNOW SERVING THIS. PROJECT GOES TO COMES OF. AND DOES THE THINGS YOU TO WHAT IS THE ON WHAT WAS THE ON BACK- LIFE BECAUSE TO THIS. FOR BUILDING ON THIS FORCE. I DON'T WOULD NEED TO CHECK THAT BACK AND- I DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNT FUNDED ME. UNLESS ONE OF MY- HAS ADDED TO FINGER JEFF. YEAH I MEAN I'M NOT EXPECTING. ON AMOUNT THAT SCALE WE'RE TALKING TENS MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF. I'M GOT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO MISS I DON'T THINK IT'S A KNOW IT'S NOT OF NO. ALL RIGHT. WELL AND GET BACK TO A ON THAT- AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS- HE'S ALSO- INTO SO I JUST WANT A SENSE OF THAT PART OF IT AND THEN- IN THEN AGAIN THAT'S- FOR THE- RAJ ACT- SO YOU SAID THAT IT'S FOLK ON A YOU KNOW- SAID THE- THAT SO OKAY I GUESS. CAN I- WELL CAN WE CAN WE HAVE L. A. O. PERHAPS COME ON THIS- PER THE MAN CARE INDIA SOME QUESTIONS FOLLOWING A. AS COMMON I MIGHT MY QUESTION WE IS GOING TO BE A- ONE WE WHEN WE- ABOUT THIS ABOUT DAY. AND DATA SECURITY OF THE OF OUR OF OUR FOLKS IN THE SYSTEM. OF M. I'M SURE THAT'S WAS PART OF THE ANALYSIS AS WELL. YES ABSOLUTELY IN FACT- WITH THE SALES FORCE AND HOW WE'RE BUILDING WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SECURITY TESTING THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT- INCLUDING BRINGING- INDEPENDENT- REVIEW. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE THE SAFEKEEPING OF. OF OUR HANDS. THE DATA PROGRAMMATIC DATA. OKAY THE END AND IF YOU BUY ON CELLS FOR SOME THEY'LL DRAW DATA BUT IT TO DO WHAT DEGREE WHAT SORT OF FOLLOW. DID HAVE WORK THINGS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT MEASURES TO HAVE IN PLACE TO ENSURE- THAT IF THERE'S A DATA BREACH THAT THAT. BECAUSE OF SOME FAULT OF THERE SO YOU KNOW HOW HOUSE HELD UP THE HANDLE. SO HAVE FOR. IN THIS- CLOUD COMPUTING GRID. AS WELL AS THE- SASS PROVISIONS. THAT DISCUSSED EIGHT IF THERE WERE TO BE A BREACH THAT SALES FORCE OR THAT THE AND- THE VENDORS WOULD BE ASSISTING US- WITH REGARDS- AND- EMILY READING. THE PROBLEM AS WELL AS- ASSISTING IN ANY NOTIFICATION XCERRA ALSO IN ONE OF OUR VENDOR CONTRACTS BECAUSE WE HAVE A- THE OVER ARCHING SYSTEMS. INTEGRATOR CONTRACT WE HAVE- SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS IN THERE WITH REGARDS TO- SECURITY AND XCERRA- THAT THEY- ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR TO ENSURE. THAT THE OVERALL SYSTEM. IT'S OUR NEED S. OKAY AND- A SIM HAS THE APPROVAL OF APPROPRIATE LIKE- PART OF TECH. AND I DON'T KNOW THERE ARE I THINK OUR- NATIONAL GUARD ALSO DOES SOME CYBER SECURITY WORK HAVE DAVE DONE OF THAT HAVE THEY DREADED THE AS THE PLATFORM TO ENSURE THAT- MEETS OUR STANDARDS FOR SECURITY. I WOULD NEED TO DEFER TO CDG ON THAT. OKAY ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS THIS PLATFORM IS USED IN OTHER CONTRACTS- AND SO I WOULD SAY. YES BUT I WOULD NEED AS FAR AS SPECIFIC SECURITY REVIEWS ETCETERA FROM THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY I'M I'M I WOULD DIFFER IT AS IS SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS PLATFORM'S BEEN USED BY THE STATE FOR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION EQUALLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. I KNOW THERE IS BEING USED ACROSS. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS IT'S IN USE FOR OKAY SO I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL PERHAPS- AND WE'VE DONE THIS PREVIOUSLY OF THE PSYCHE ANSWER QUESTIONS AS WELL WHEN WE DO OVERSIGHT. BUT I WAS HOPING WE CAN HEAR ALSO SOME OVERSIGHT FROM L. A. L. TWO SUGGESTIONS MILLENNIAL BUT YET BUT I SEE CITY T. IS ALSO ALSO HERE NOW. OKAY. BANK- THIS IS FOR CONTRACT WE HAD A LEGAL REVIEW BUT THIS AND PROVISION SIDE OF THE AND WE CHAU THAT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR BY FOR THIS YEAR ADVANTAGE AND THE INCLUDED A DATA AND THIS YEAR FIRST OKAY THEN I GUESS ONE OF QUESTION IN TERMS OF AGAIN AND NOW I'VE IT. BUT WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT. FOR LET'S SAY FIVE OR YEARS FROM NOW- WE THIS THAT. SELLS FOR ISN'T THE PARTNER WANT TO USE WE WATCH FOR. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR- SIGN IN A WAY THAT SORT OF LOCKS US. A WHERE- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE POOL. WE HAVE TO USE. THE GOAL IS TO HAVE OUR BUSINESS RULES AND OUR DATA- AND EIGHT WHAT'S CALLED A DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SEPARATE APART FROM SALES FORCE TO ALLOW THE STATE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE WE HAVE THE OWNERSHIP OF THAT CORE INFORMATION AND SO IN THE FUTURE SHOULD WE WANT TO CHANGE PLATFORMS OR DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE WOULD NOT BE LOCKED IN. OKAY THAT'S GOING TO BE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE OWN THE DATA THAT WE CONTROL THE DATA THAT WE'RE NOT IN THAT SITUATION WHERE WE'RE LOCKED INTO A PARTICULAR VENDOR BECAUSE OUT OF DESIGN. WE WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH THAT. HELLO. PRIME MINISTER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RAISE NO SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS BUT WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUOUS OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROJECT THROUGH THE MONTHLY REPORTS AND QUARTERLY BRIEFINGS THAT WERE ALREADY MENTIONED- THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT HAS INCREASED FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO NINE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN MILLION WITH AROUND TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT- THE ESTIMATED TOTAL PROJECT COST COULD CHANGE HOWEVER AS THERE ARE SEVERAL PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER WAY AND CDC IS REQUIRING A MORE PRECISE COST ESTIMATION BE PROVIDED BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR- THE PROJECT IS ALSO ANTICIPATING A PILOT. FOR A SINGLE MODULE FROM THE PROJECT IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO TEST WHETHER THIS NEW APPROACH THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DESCRIBED AS WORKING AND TO ESTABLISH KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO SHOW WITH DATA WHETHER NEW SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITIES ARE IMPROVING- THE SYSTEM THE STATE'S- BUSINESS PROCESS SEES AND SO OVERSIGHT OF THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PARTICULAR PILOT MODULE IN THE CREATION OF THOSE- KPIS OR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS I'M WILL BE CRITICAL TO SEE WHETHER THE. PROJECT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL GOING FORWARD. YEAH I WOULD I THINK A STEP THIS LIKE THIS IN HAVE A STEP YET MUCH WEEK THOSE A- THAT WE BE ABLE TO CHECK THE- IN- AND AGAIN JUST CONTINUE TO BACK WITH THE WITH THE PROCESS. ALRP DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING ON THIS. JUST RAISED- FINANCE I'M COMMENT THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL TIME TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE- THIS IS JUST ONE COMPONENT. OF THE PROPOSAL YOU'LL SEE THE- DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES COMPONENT INCLUDING THE MAY REVISION SO- I DIDN'T JUST I CAN SAY THAT OUR SERVER. THEY'LL BE SOME. TIME TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR QUESTION. OKAY WELL I GUESS I'D SAY IT JUST IS THAT. EVERY THAT AND RECOGNIZING HERE WE'LL JUST LOOK AT ONE P. OF THAT- AT IN APPRECIATE WE'RE DOING THE- REPORTS ON THE COR THE REPORT. BY I THINK AT LEAST FOR US IS LEGISLATORS- WE PROBABLY SHOULD AT LEAST ANNUALLY- HAVE A YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A HEARING WITHIN THE BUDGETS OF THREE FIVE ELECTED TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. AND DEPTH TIME. GOING OVER- JUST THAT THE PROJECT AYE YOU'LL MAKE NOTE AGAIN AS LA- MENTIONED THEY'LL THE PRICE OF THE PROJECT HAS GONE UP FOR. CLOSING IN ON A BILLION- SELLER NINE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION- AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S- GOING ON HI. AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING I ALSO WOULD JUST WANNA PUT A PEN ON IS THAT AND I'VE ASKED THIS QUESTION USUALLY WITH IT PROJECTS IN THE PAST. IS THAT- YES OFTENTIMES YEAH AND IT PROJECTS SHOULD ALSO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCY. SO SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTING- THAT THIS POINT OVER NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN THIS PROJECT- IT- SO IT'S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT METRICS WERE HAVING IN TERMS OF INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY. OF- STATE AND COUNTY. NO ALSO. BETTER IMPROVEMENTS AND- OF SERVICE AND SPLIT ENDS. WHETHER TO. OR ARE. NOW AND FORTH. FOR OUR CLIENT HEALTH KLEIN. TO ARE BEING SERVED. SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THOSE METRICS IDENTIFIED AND MEASURED SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING OF ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING BACK IN RETURN FOR THAT- SO. OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE SAY OH YEAH WE NEED A NEW I. T. PROJECT AND WILL HAVE ALL THESE. THINGS WILL BE BETTER BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BETTER QUANTIFY THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE EXPECTING. FOUR INVESTMENT WITH THESE IT PROJECTS ESPECIALLY AGAINST YOU KNOW WE HAVE. THE SPECIAL RESPONDING THIS MUCH MONEY ON THEM. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE INDICATORS ARE AND THEN FIGURE OF FOR ME TO THEM AND IF AND HOW DO WE GET IF WE'RE- IN. THE PROTECT IN PLACE FOR. SOME A PROGRAM LIKE THIS GOES WRONG. JUST LIKE. APARTMENT OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT WE ALL HEAR ABOUT IT AND IT. THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. IN THE CHILD WELFARE.

THAT WILL HELP TO MAKE PROGRESS ON I JUST AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THIS REFLECTS A PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY SEIU CALIFORNIA U. D. W. ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS URGE DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S MARCH SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. MORE DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL PLEASE REFER TO THE MARCH SECOND HEARING AGENDA THE LAST BULLET IS FOR I FISCAL PENALTY FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS COUNTIES. FAILING TO BARGAIN IN GOOD FAITH. THIS PROPOSAL THIS REFLECTS A PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY U. D. W. ASKED ME THIRTY NINE THIRTY AND S. CI YOU HEARD DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S MARCH SECOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. MORE DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL PLEASE REFER TO THE MARCH SECOND HEARING. AGENDA THANK YOU. FOR THE YOU VERY MUCH- AND NOW THE STATUS NO FOR THE RECORD IT PEOPLE ARE WONDERING THAT THE BILL THAT THIS IS INTO EFFECT SUPPORT- WILL ALLOW H. AS WERE TO GO INTO ADULTHOOD FACILITIES RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. WITH BECAUSE THERE'S NOT QUITE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THAT SYSTEM SOUGHT I'VE JUST ALWAYS LIKE TO GIVE MY VOICE TO WE NEED EVEN MORE RESOURCES IN THIS AREA. TO CARE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND IN HOUSING AND SAFETY AS AS PEOPLE AGE AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH PERSISTENT. AND SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- OKAY. WOULD YOU WANT TO MISS ANYTHING WHEN THIS. NO BUDGET PLEASE WE'RE CONSIDERING THESE YES THESE ARE GREAT THINGS TO CONSIDER RAISING BOTH BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE HELP IN FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE- AND MAKING SURE OUR WORKERS. ARE TAKEN CARE OF IN THE PROCESS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- IT'S A GREAT LONG HISTORY. OF FINANCE DO YOU. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND I'M CONFIRMING OPINIONS OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE- STAKEHOLDERS WITH US TODAY. AND WE HAVE AND WE SEE A- PLEASE IT COLEMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE A BUDGET ASSOCIATION JUSTIN GARRETT CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND BEVERLY USE STATE OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FROM U. D. W. AND ASKS ME THREE NINETY WELCOME. CAN YOU PLEASE EACH BEEN ASKED TO ANSWER A QUESTION RELATED TO THESE PROPOSALS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU. SO I'M ASSUMING THAT I'M JUST GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE PAZ'S OKAY MY NAME IS LISA COLEMAN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION. AND I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL TO RESOURCE- THE SS I SS P. FACILITIES. THAT PROVIDE CARE TO RESIDENCY. OUR CITIES AND I DON'T RISK ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE FACING CRITICAL HOUSING SHORTAGES AND IT'S NOT JUST HOUSING FOR THESE VULNERABLE ADULTS IT'S HOUSING WITH RESOURCE IT'S HOUSING WITH. MANAGEMENT IT'S MORE THAN JUST SHELTER AND FOOD THESE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THEM THROUGH A RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES AND ASK- AND OURS. ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE THAN THEY WOULD FIND LIVING INDEPENDENTLY- LIVING WITH FAMILY FOR. ULTIMATELY HAVING TO MOVE INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OVER UTILIZING OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM. AND YET THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR RESIDENTS OF FOUR FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE CARE TO RESIDENTS IN THE SSI ASSISTED PROGRAMS IS JUST OVER A THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY. IN COMPARISON THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE FOR AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY. IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY SO WE'RE ASKING THESE FACILITIES TO PRIVATE PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SERVICES PER FRACTION OF THE SUPPORT. AND SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT THESE BUSINESSES ARE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT OF THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES ARE FALLING DOWN AROUND RESIDENTS BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NO EXTRA MONEY TO FIX THE ROOF. TO FIX A WATER HEATER. SO THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS. A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE OF DIGNITY FOR THESE VERY VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS. IT WOULD AMOUNT TO A THIRTY TWO DOLLAR A DAY INVESTMENT. WHICH ALMOST DOUBLES THE DAILY RATE AND ALLOWS THESE BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE SO DEDICATED. TO TWO FIVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO KEEP THESE BUILDINGS UP AND- NO THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN STATE THEY ARE AMAZING ADVOCATES. AND THEY DO INCREDIBLE ACTS OF SERVICE ACTIVITIES FOR THESE RESIDENTS BUT THEY'RE NOT MAGICIANS AND THEY CANNOT FIND IT EMPTY BED WHEN ONE OF THESE FACILITIES THAT PROVIDES FOR THIS LOWEST OF THE LOW INCOME WHEN THOSE FACILITIES BECAUSE- THOMPSON'S DESK. BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE MAGIC WANDS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE RESIDENTS MOVE AWAY FROM THE FAMILIES AND FRIENDS THEY HAVE. THEY BECOME HOME. THEY BECOME. FREQUENT FLYER AND ARM ROOM. THANK THIS. I ENCOURAGE. THE LETTUCE TO INCLUDE THIS IN THE BUDGET IS THE TRUTH IS WE ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THESE. INDIVIDUALS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND THIS IS A WAY TO PROVIDE SOMEONE CARE AND DIGNITY. OUT MORE THAN JUST SHELTER IT PROVIDES THEM WITH THE WHOLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE I STILL THINK IT'S QUITE ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S USING- IT'S ONE SOLUTION- ONE INTERVENTION I THINK TO TAKE CARE OF A- BIGGER ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON. OKAY NEXT WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT JUSTIN WITH THE ADJUSTING GEAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. HI IT'S SAD YEAH. CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I WANT TO THANK. I CHAIR EGGMAN MEMBERS FOR APARTHEID IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR INCLUSION ON THE AGENDA. FEDERATION WITHIN THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN.

BUT SOME COUNTIES HAVE SHOWN IS THAT ALONG WITH CARROTS WE NEED TO STICK. SOME HAVE THE TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND I JUST PROVIDERS WE REPRESENT. WE STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DIFFERENT FINANCE. OKAY THE WELL I THINK THESE ARE ALL PLANS WE'RE GETTING WORKERS AND WE'RE MAKING SURE WORKERS ARE TAKING CARE OF IN THE- WHICH WOULD ATTRACT. A YOU- ACTUALLY AT THE FOR MAKERS OF TO- TO JUST AND FROM C. YEAH HAPPENED IN QUESTIONS YEAH SO- SO CERTAINLY HEARD YOUR TEST YUP- IN SUPPORT OF COURSE OF FOR THE THAT PERCENTAGE BUT THEN SAID THAT THE SEX A PER TO. S. SO WE FROM THEM FROM NIGHT YOU NEED AND OF ALL HEARD FROM PEOPLE FROM. S. TWENTY FIFTEEN SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO AS A STATE AND WHAT SHOULD WE DO HAVE A COW DOESN'T- GET A CUT WITH THEIR- I JUST US WORKERS I MEAN WE HEARD FROM- SEVERAL YEARS THAT THERE'S ONE COUNTY THAT'S NEVER DONE IT ANOTHER ONE SIX YEARS OUT. OF THE ONCE THREE YEARS OUT AND I KNOW IN YOU YOU'VE EXPRESSED OPPOSITION TO THEIR PROPOSAL DO YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND YOU KNOW PLEASE ACTON COUNTY WE ABSOLUTELY SHARED INTERESTS IN ENSURING. OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE COUNTY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND UNDERSTANDING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. I ONE THING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS YOU KNOW IN THE THREE COUNTIES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH MEDIATION OR FACT. FINDING THEY ALL I WANT IN THE PROCESS OFFERED A LEADING OF EXAMPLE OF. EITHER COUNTY ARE OFFERED ZERO AND DRAGGING GO SHE OUT. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A POINT IN THE PROCESS WHERE I THESE CAN HAVE OFFERED INCREASE. FOR AN AMOUNT WOULD COST MORE THAN THE 1% PENALTY- ALTERNATELY THAT WAS AGREED WITH UNION AND THEY- TO GO SHE DIDN'T GOT THE WHERE THEY WERE. ANY SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY THINK- POTS FISCAL. YEAH I CAN TO POSSIBLE. SO YOU SO WHAT WAS WHAT WE YOU DO WHAT SHOULD HAVE IF THERE NO IF THEY CAN'T TO A. YOU KNOW I THINK- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT- BEING ABLE TO CAN IT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO- WELL KNOW AGAIN THE POWER OFFERED NOW WAIT INCREASE THAT MONTH WHAT I GUESS THE QUESTION I FOR YOU IS THAT HAVE A WE CERTAINLY HAVE PROPOSED THAT YOU DON'T THAT. THAT SEE SAID TO YOU BUT HE SAID IT DOESN'T LIE BUT YET WE COUNTY SO DON'T HAVE A SO. IS THERE. TO THAT YOU DO YOU THINK. TO THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE KIND IT'S I EVERY THAT SOME OF COUNTIES MADE OFFER. BUT THERE'S NO AGREEMENT. AND SOME OF. SOME OF ITS AWHILE SO. DO YOU HAVE AN- TEND TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO ADD GET THEM AGREE. YEAH CERTAINLY I MEAN WE KNOW THE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AN HAS COME. ALL BOB FOR WAY TO LOOK COLLECTED BY WHETHER IT'S THE STATE- TAKING OVER COLLECTOR BARGAINING INVEST MORE- CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE COUNTY TO. CONTINUE TO GO. TO CAN YOU CAN TO PUT- ADDITION OFFERS ON TABLE I THEY'VE DONE I'M A IT'S ALSO REALLY. TO LOOK. ALL COULD BE FOR OF THE OTHER. WHO HAVE DONE. EXACTLY AS LEGISLATURE. HAS THAT OF THEM AND AGAIN THESE KIND OF BEEN BARRED IN BAD THEY JUST FAILED REACH AN AGREEMENT FROM WHAT PUT OUT A- OFFER. WELL I'M BY NATURE THAT CONTINUE TO THE DATA INTO THE PANEL BY TEMPLE FOR YOU KNOW THE OTHER CAN THAT. TO DO. RIGHT WOULD THINK IN THE PRO. I WOULDN'T GET YOU KNOW REALLY- KIND OF LEVERAGES THE LOCAL BAR AWAY THAT THAT THE. SO SO WHATEVER INCENTIVES WE HAVE IN PLACE AN EFFECTIVE PENALTIES ONLY APPLY IF THERE ISN'T. AN AGREEMENT SO YOU KNOW I DAY AS YOUR TO CONCERN ABOUT THE PENALTY BUT IF THERE'S- IS ALL THEY CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT WERE FINE. SO IN WITH THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO BE SO- I I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME MORE SUGGESTIONS AS TO WHAT TO DO FOR YEARS. AND IN SITUATIONS WHERE. THERE IS NO AGREEMENT AND- FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME. AND I THINK THE- I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS THAT- THAT SITUATION FORTUNATE EXIST IN SOME COUNTIES BUT- AND- I pOF THE PARTIES ARE FREE AT EARLY SUGGESTING SOME SOLUTIONS TO TRY TO. TO PUSH TO TORONTO TO GET TO AN AGREEMENT- BUT I THINK IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US- ULTIMATELY I THINK WE ARE ALL BETTER OFF IF THERE ACTUALLY IS AN AGREEMENT SO. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COUNTIES NOT IN AGREEMENT IS PROBLEMATIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY YES MISTER GARRETT SOUNDS LIKE. DOCTOR PASSED YOU FOR SOME MORE SOLUTIONS AND- IF YOU'D LIKE TO CONTINUE LIKE ON LIKE IT'S GOING BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO. THAT WE WILL MOVE ON FOR NOW- AND- GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FOR. FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT. LEVEL RESOURCES. YOU BACK WITH US MCGEORGE. THANK YOU. AND IF YOU POOREST FAMILY FIRST A LITTLE RESTORED FIFTY DFS IS REQUESTING THREE POINT TWO MILLION TWO POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEN TWO POINT SIX MILLION ONE POINT NINE GENERAL FUND DANIEL EITHER AFTER BIRTH SEVEN PERMANENT POSITIONS CONTRACT FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR COMPLIANCE AND PARTICIPATION IN THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION APARTMENT THE BASKET YEAH AND CIVICALLY I'M IMPLEMENTING THE PREVENTION SERVICES PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY PART ONE OF THAT ACT. THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THE FIFTH SEEDED WITH THE FAMILY FIRST ACT ALLOWED TO DEVELOP TRAINING CURRICULUM PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES SUCH AS THE FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE MODEL FIDELITY FOR THE ACCIDENT EIGHT THE BETTER IMPLEMENTED AS WELL TO CONTINUE A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EVALUATIONS. THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL LAW. THERE WAS ADEQUATE IN THE HOW WILL THE STATE. WELL OUT PLAN IF I COUNTY THAT PREVIEW HAD. FUTURE FOR YOU PREVENT SERVICES AND WILL THEY BE TO MAKE A LOT OF URBAN JERRY. THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PAST. THE PREVENTION OF THE RECRUITMENT BAILABLE. TO AT THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION PURPOSES DR AREN'T LIMITED AS COMPARED TO THE FLEXIBILITY THAT COUNTY PROUD AND THEREFORE YOU LABOR DEMONSTRATION. FAMILY FIRST ONLY ALLOWED FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PREVENTION SERVICES IN THREE CATEGORIES. REDUCE TREATMENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IN HOME PARENTING SKILLS BASED PROGRAM. ANY FURTHER AND ANY SERVICE OFFERED WITHIN ONE OF THOSE THREE CATEGORIES HAVE TO BE APPROVED AND BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE FEDERAL TITLE FOR YOU CLEARING HOUSE. BUT BEING ESTABLISH AND MEETING AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE THAT HAS TO BE EVALUATED. ARE WELL SUPPORTED DEPORTED OR PROMISING PRACTICE. AND FINALLY THE SERVICES- FUNDED THROUGH FAMILY FIRST ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO BE PROVIDED TO A CHILD ONCE THEY'VE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR FOSTER CARE- ENOUGH TO FIND IN THE FEDERAL LAW AND CHILDREN AT IMMINENT. RISK OF ENTERING FOSTER CARE. SO ALL OF THEM. REQUIREMENTS ARE FROM TO THAN WHAT AVAILABLE TO YOU CHINESE ARE OPERATE THE WAY TWENTY MINUTES RICK. EXISTED LIMITATION. THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE ABLE OFFER FAR FEWER- BECAUSE THEY ARE PART FEWER PROGRAMS AVAILABLE AND THE PREVENTION CARE WITH THIS CLEARING HOUSE AT THE MOMENT I THINK THERE'S TWENTY FIVE PROGRAMS IN THE PREVENTION SERVICES CLEARING HOUSE TEN OF THEM ARE RATED AT FAULT THE PART AT THE MOMENT. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT WE DID RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE FAMILY FIRST TRANSITION BACK TO HELP WITH THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE WAVERED. THE FAMILY FIRST TRANSITION ACT INCLUDED ONE TIME BOND WHICH WERE IN THE PROCESS OF DISTRIBUTING TO ALL THE COUNTY TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES. RELATED TO FAMILY FIRST. AND IT ALSO PROVIDED CERTAINTY GRANTS WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO OUR WAIVER COUNTY AND INTENDED TO MITIGATE THAT SHORTFALL EXPERIENCED AS A RESULT OF THE WAY FOR A LOT. FOR FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT REGARD TO THE SECOND QUESTION HOW WE'RE APPROACHING THE ROLE OF THE FAMILY FIRST- THAT PREVENTION PLAN OF CURRENTLY OUT FOR STAKEHOLDER REVIEW PROPOSES THAT EIGHT THEN APPROACH. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WE PROPOSE STARTING WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF WELL SUPPORTED EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. I WAS JUST MENTIONING THE NUMBER NUMEROUS REQUIREMENTS AS STATED WITH THE FEDERAL LAW FOR IMPLEMENTING FAMILY FOR. AND STARTING WITH A FEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE WELL SUPPORTED IN THE FIRST YEAR WILL ALLOW IT TO. THE PROPERTY WHAT'S COUNTY TO ESTABLISH THE DATA COLLECTION THAT'S REQUIRED. THE PER CHILD FISCAL REPORTING THAT TRACKING AND OVERSIGHT ENSURING MODEL FACILITY TO EVERY EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM THAT WE IMPLEMENT. AUTOMATION THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO FALL TO CONTINUE A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. PROPERTIES READING STARTING WITH A SMALL NUMBER PROGRAMS WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE ALSO ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY TIME TO DEVELOP READY NOT FOR OPTING AND I'M A FAST THERE AT LEVEL OF PREVENTION NEEDS. ESTABLISH CONTRACTS THAT ARE NECESSARY ENTRY APPROPRIATE STAFF THAT WANT THESE PROPERTIES ARE ALL STOP LIST. WE'RE HOPING WE CAN RAPIDLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS. THE STATE AND THAT A YEAR. MEETING INTERNATIONAL CLASS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHORT. THANK YOU ANALYSTS ARE WITH ALL ITS ANALYST- WE JUST WANTED TO SAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS- WITH THE REQUEST FOR STAFFING RESOURCES- BUT WE DID JUST WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO FLAG THAT WE DO YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STATE'S OVERALL PLAN FOR PREVENTION SERVICES- INCLUDING SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE RAISED IN RESPONSE THE GOVERNOR'S GENERAL BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL AS THE- FIRST DRAFT OF TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR ACCESS PSA IMPLEMENTATION- AND IN PARTICULAR A KEY QUESTION WE HAVE. IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO COUNTIES- FOR PREVENTION SERVICES TO ENSURE THAT ELIGIBLE YOUTH AND FAMILIES REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE ACCESS TO PREVENTION SERVICES- AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT G. SENATE- SENATE DEMOCRATS INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR- BUDGET PRIORITIES PLAN WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT- IN A IN A LATER AGENDA ITEM- AND SO ULTIMATELY DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE OF STATE LEVEL FUNDING FOR PREVENTION SERVICES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO PROVIDE- THAT MAY IMPACT THE LEVEL OF CENTRAL RESOURCES pSERVICES- SO. WE AGREE WITH A STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE ITS OVERALL APPROACH TO PREVENTION SERVICES AND ACCESS PSA PART ONE IMPLEMENTATION- BEFORE APPROVING THOSE STAFFING RESOURCES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AS PART FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OKAY YEAH- MISH WORST YOU HAVE DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THE SHORTS. THAT WE JUST NEED MORE WE NEED MORE GENERAL FUNDING FOR THAT. THE TO BE ABLE TO TRULY MEET THE NEEDS. OF EVERY KID. AND FAMILY WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME AND I DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OKAY THANK YOU YEAH I JUST I MEAN I WOULD NOTED MY OWN TO COUNTIES- THAT CHILD WELFARE SERVICES- AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE AN INCIDENT MANY OF MY- FORMER STUDENTS AND COLLEAGUES ARE FRONTLINE. CAL WILL FOR WORKERS I JUST KNOW THAT THE STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES- CASELOADS ARE STILL WAIT I MEAN. IT'S HARD TO DO PREVENTION WHEN YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PUT OUT FIRES CONSTANTLY ALL DAY LONG ESPECIALLY DURING THESE PANDEMIC TIME SO- AND I AND I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE- MAJORITY. WITH TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW PLAN I MEAN HOW MANY KIDS THEN DO WE DO WE LEAVE BEHIND A FOR YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THOSE THAT WE CAN. ADD THAT FALL WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES FOR TITLE FOR YOU BUT WHAT HOW ABOUT THE ALL THE REST OF THEM WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR. ADJUSTED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR FAMILY FOR SERVICES. I DON'T. REMEMBER IF I MEAN I KNOW THAT THIS WAS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE. M. AS PART OF THE FEDERAL LONG WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FULLY OPERATIONALIZED. FAMILY FIRST- RECOGNIZING THAT. APPROACH THAT ALLOWS US TO REALLY BUILD A STRONG FOUNDATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED IN ORDER TO DO. I'M REALLY COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL LAW. OKAY YEAH AND I KNOW I MEAN I KNOW WE ALL WE ALL KEEP IN IN THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO COMPLY WITH. FEDERAL LAWS BUT TO KEEP KIDS AND FAMILY SAFE. THE DEFENSE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN I THINK WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT IN A BUDGET ITEM STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY NET CHILD WELFARE FOSTER CARE. IT. THANK YOU MISS SHORT ARGENIS ONE FOR US OKAY YES OKAY THANK YOU- YES OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN ASKED TO PRESENT COMPONENTS OF THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN- AND FOR CHILD WELFARE I WILL READ SEE ASK FOR PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA. THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE DO NOT RELATED TO CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS. ONE PROVIDE FUNDING FOR PLACEMENTS FOR HIGH NEEDS YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE. TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR COUNTY ADMINISTERED CHILD WELFARE PREVENTION SERVICES THIS REFLECTS A PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND HER DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. THREE FUNDS A PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE A UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD FUND S. B. AT SEVEN THIRTY NINE AUTHORED BY SENATOR CORTEZ HE- AND FINALLY APPROVED FUNDS TO PROVIDE COVERT RELIEF FOR SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS. THIS REFLECTS A PROPOSAL PUT FORTH BY THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES AND HEARD DURING THE COMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL ON FOR THIS- AND WE HAVE REQUESTED JENNIFER RODRIGUEZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF YOUTH LAWCENTER- CHICLET DISCUSSED SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THE STATE CAN MAKE AND THEN WE HAVE- VERONICA. THE AREA FOR FOSTER FORMER SHE'S A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND SHE CAN HELP ME WITH THE PLANTATION NUMBER LAST NAME. THAT AFTERNOON. THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR ALL BUT FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING THE PAST YEAR HAS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR POLICYMAKERS HOW CHILD WELFARE IS PARTICULARLY FAILING TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO WE HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE FOR PROTECT AND SUPPORT. THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS FAILURE FALL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BLACK AND INDIGENOUS CHILDREN WITH LIFE ALTERING IMPACTS. OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM HAS STRAINED TO CARE FOR CHILDREN REMOVED FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR DECADES SINCE THE TIME I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE. YOUTH AND FAMILIES HAVE GUIDED US TO NEEDED REFORMS WE NEED THE KIND OF PREVENTION SERVICES TO ENSURE WE CAN DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO AVOID SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO CARE FOR THEM INCLUDING PROVIDING BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS HOUSING CHILD CARE MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FOR BOTH FAMILIES AND TEENAGERS SUPPORTS FOR EXPECTANT AND PARENTING PASTILLAS. AND INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT YOU FROM JUVENILE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. FAMILIES FIRST FUNDING IS A START BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS THAT FAMILIES TELL US THEY NED. WE CAN BUY IT WE SHOULD DO IT WE SHOULD NEVER SEPARATE A CHILD FROM THEIR FAMILY UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION FOR SAFETY. AND WHEN WE DO REMOVE CALIFORNIA HAS TO GUARANTEE THE MOST BASIC AND CRITICAL RIGHT THAT THEY'LL RECEIVE EXCELLENT QUALITY. PARENTING AND AN ALTERNATE FAMILY. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET TO THE SCHOOL. OVER THE PAST YEAR THE NATIONAL NEWS MEDIA HAS GIVEN EXTENSIVE IN DEPTH COVERAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICE OF PLACING YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. AN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES THAT NOT ONLY DID NOT MEET CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS. BUT ALSO SUBJECTED YOUNG PEOPLE TO. UNTHINKABLE ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF PORTABLE CONDITIONS- AND- THOSE INCLUDED WITNESSING STAFF MURDER YOUTH WITH EXTENDED RESTRAINTS AT. LAKESIDE ACADEMY IN MICHIGAN. AND ALSO STAFF BEING CHARGED WITH SEXUAL ASSAULTS FOR RAPING A RESIDENT OF CLARINDA ACADEMY IN IOWA. ALONG WITH DOZENS OF ADDITIONAL VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAW AND REGULATIONS OVER JUST THE PAST FEW YEARS. THOSE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY NATIONAL NEWS SOURCES AS PROFITABLE DEATH TRAPS. THAT COLLECT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF GOVERNMENT DOLLARS WHILE ABUSING AND NEGLECTING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AND AS IS TRUE FOR MOST BAD PRACTICE IN FOSTER CARE BLACKEYED HAVE BEEN DESPERATELY IMPACTED. IN A ONE ONE STOP SHOP OF PLACEMENTS FROM JULY. BLACK CHILDREN REPRESENTED ABOUT 33% OF THOSE SENT OUT OF STATE DESPITE MAKING UP ONLY 20% OF LAST YEAR AND ROUGHLY 5% OF ALL CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. THIS ISN'T A NEW PROBLEM. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH ABOUT A STATE FACILITIES HAS RESULTED IN CHILDREN BEING HARMED BY ABUSIVE PRACTICES BY PARK CONDITIONS AND BY AN ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT. IN DECEMBER CALIFORNIA DECERTIFIED THE OUT OF STATE FACILITIES COUNTIES REPLACING CHILDREN AND FOR FAILURE TO MEET OUR VERY BASIC STANDARDS. BUT THIS ISN'T A PERMANENT SOLUTION. TO BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA'S DECERTIFICATION OF THESE FACILITIES DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT CALIFORNIA FROM APPROVING THE SAME OR NEW OUT OF STATE FACILITIES. TO TAKE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN TODAY. WE NEED POLICY ACTION TO PLACE A PERMANENT MORATORIUM AND PLACEMENT ON OUT OF STATE FACILITIES FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AND WE HAVE TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN THE RESOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NEW STATE INVESTMENTS COULD FIND EXPERT REVIEWS OF EACH OF THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUAL CASES OF YOU THOUGHT REQUEST OUT OF STATE. HI. JENNIFER I WHAT THEY NEEDED THAT WASN'T A BILL LOCAL AND STATE AND WHY IT WAS NOT AND AVAIL AND HOW TO. USE THAT AND CAL. I'M GOING STATE INTENSIVE TA WITH EXPERTS TO SUPPORT COUNTIES ON SPECIFIC CASES. AND TO ASSIST THEM IN ACCESSING THE EXISTING ENTITLEMENTS THAT FIND MANY OF THE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR YET. CDSS SEED FUNDING FOR PILOTS TO ADDRESS PARTICULAR GAPS IN POPULATIONS. YOU CAN FAMILY PEER SUPPORT AND MENTORING ADDITIONAL STATE% FUNDING FOR SUPPORTIVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR MINORS. AND DEEPENING THE STATE'S QUALITY CONTROL RESPONSE IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY. MOST IMPORTANTLY AND TALKING WITH YOU FROM THE CALIFORNIA CONNECTION WHO EXPERIENCE NOT BEING SERVED WELL BY FOSTER CARE. IDENTIFIED WHEN INVESTMENT AS THE MOST POTENTIALLY POWERFUL. DESIGNATING STATE FUNDING TO PAY FOR ANYTHING NEEDED BY YES UNFUNDED OR UNAVAILABLE WHO HAVE SPECIALIZED NEEDS SUCH AS PARTICIPATION IN ORGANIZED SPORTS TRADE APPRENTICESHIPS ARE TO ME THAT COUNTS DURING SCHOOL BREAKS. COMMUNITY BASED MENTORING COST TO ALLOW REUNIFICATION WITH FAMILIES. THAT IS HOUSING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OUTPATIENT TREATMENT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL. PARENT TRAINING BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS RESPITE CARE AND. OCCASIONAL JOB IN TRANSITION CLASS. WE WERE LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY THAT ARE EXTENDED FOR NEW SERVICES OR NEW PILOTS DO YOU INCLUDE ANY EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES FOR THE CHILD TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE SPECIFIC POPULATION. WHAT THE REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IT IS WELL PAST TIME THAT WE ACT ON THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISS VERONICA. YES. WELCOME TO HELP ME WITH YOUR LAST NAME HOW DO I SET YEAH YEAH I KNOW IT'S A V. EIGHT AT THE ADA OKAY ALL RIGHT. RIGHT OFF ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THANKS OKAY NO YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO US ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HAVING A BASIC INCOME EXITING FROM THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING A U. B. I. OR UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME FOR KIDS TRANSITIONING OUT KENTUCKY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE IMPACT OF THAT. YES CRYSTAL I MENTION THIS MYSELF MY NAME IS VERONICA AND I'M OPPOSED TO USE AND TEND TO BE GRADUATED FROM SOUNDS OF STATE WITH A BACHELORS IN PUBLIC HEALTH- I AM PARTICIPATING AND THEN UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME PILOT PROGRAM. AND THAT'S A LONG NAME BUT DO FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BOARD THANK- WHAT ABOUT A MONTH NOW. AS A PARTICIPANT I RECEIVED AN UNCONDITIONAL. PAYMENT OF ONE THOUSAND PER MONTH. HAPPENED A MINK. THEIR BY THE ENDING MY RECENT PAY INTERNSHIP MIND. WHAT'S AND THEY'LL EVERITT EARLIER THAN USUAL- AND AGES IT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR ME HAS TO FIND A JOB THAT COULD ACCUMULATE WITH MY SCHOOL- AND JUST TIME TO VISIT ALSO MY YOUNGER SIS. IS THEM WHICH WAS. EXACTLY A MONTH AFTER THAT PANDEMIC. I'M ONLY INCOME HAS BEEN A GREAT HELP TO PAY FOR MY IMPORTANT BILLS LIKE RENT CAR PHONE INSURANCE. AND HE HAS KEPT ME ON MY FEET WILL BE IN A FULL TIME STUDENT. THE INCOME- THE INCOME THAT'S ME PAY MY BILLS FOR AT LEAST ONE MONTH AHEAD. IT'S AN AND THEY HAVE ENOUGH MONEY LEFT OVER FOR FOOD AND HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF INCOME LEFT FOR SAVINGS WHICH THANKS TO THE SAVINGS I WAS ABLE TO AFFORD A NEW LAPTOP FOR SCHOOL WHEN MY LAST ONE STOP WORKING. IF THIS BENEFIT WHAT TO STOP TOMORROW IT WILL MAKE SUCH A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MY LIFE. AS A MOMENT I'M NOT WORKING DUE TO COPING MOST JOBS ARE ONLY HIRING FULL TIME AND NOT PART TIME. IF THEY WANT FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM APPERLEY WE STRUGGLING TO HAVE A MEAL EVERY DAY I PROBABLY BE HOMELESS ALL HAVE DROP OFF FROM SCHOOL ON MY LAST SEMESTER. I BELIEVE THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT. I BELIEVE IT'S MORE THAN BORN TO INVEST IN FOR THREE YEARS BECAUSE LIKE MYSELF. TO SOME THE PILOT PROGRAM IS LIKE A HERO READY TO SEE FAR LACKS WHEN WE HAD JUST EXITED THE SYSTEM WITH NO CLUE ON WHAT TO DO NEXT. MANY USERS LIKE MYSELF EXIT THE SYSTEM WOULD ONLY A FULL DAY FOR ALL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OPEN AND WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. AND BE INDEPENDENT WITHOUT ANY RESOURCES. MANY USERS ARE LOOKING TO BE ADOPTED THE NEXT STEPS ARE BECOMING FULLY INDEPENDENT. AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME FOR TRANSITION AGE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. ACT IS WHAT BEEN INVESTED ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR UPCOMING GRADUATION HIS SITES VERY PROUD OF YOU. HOPE TO SEE IF MAYBE YOU KNOW. IN THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL- YEAH I. AND I WOULD JUST IMAGINE AND I WOULD ASK YOU I MEAN JUST I NOTICE STRESSFUL BEING A STUDENT I NOTICED STRESSFUL JUST BEING A YOUNG PERSON DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND I WONDER WHAT IT BEEN LIKE FOR YOU F YOU TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. YOUR NEXT MEAL OR A PLACE TO LIVE WORK MONEY FOR TRANSPORTATION. THE AMOUNT OF STRESS I MEAN CAN YOU EVEN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT THE- THE BLAST STRESS YOU HAD BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD THAT INCREASING YOUR- THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. WHERE YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK WAS COMING FROM. YES OF COURSE IS SUCH BIG HELP. SINCE I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSING ON SCHOOL FOR SUCH A LONG TIME AND I'M JUST ON MY LAST SEMESTER. I FEEL LIKE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE PROGRAM WITH A JUST DROP EXACTLY ON THE LAST ONE AND BE LIKE WELL I GOT TO WORK I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME MONEY LIKE ANY. BILLS TO PAY AND THAT NEEDS SOME FOOD TO EAT. AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS JUST A GREAT HELP AND I REALLY SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THE OTHER PEOPLE. THE OTHER PUTS USER GETTING AS WELL SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S SUCH A BIG INVESTMENT. AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT. I THINK ANY TIME WE CAN INVEST IN SOME FANTASTIC AND PEOPLE LIKE YOU. IT IS WELL WORTH STATE MONEY. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND CONGRATULATIONS. I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE FUTURE. YEAH I HAVE TO LIVE IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON AND WE DID A- A U. B. I. PILOT AS WELL. WE JUST GOT THE RESULTS AFTER A YEAR AND THAT'S WHAT THEY FOUND IT JUST DECREASES PEOPLE STRESS. IT ALLOWS PEOPLE EVEN TO GET. BETTER JOBS MORE JOBS SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE FIRST ONE THAT'S OFFERED TO THEM. AND THEY HAVE MORE TIME TO. TO REFLECT SO. WE'RE EXCITED FOR YOU. GOING FORWARD AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS. THIS BUDGET ITEMS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY AND I THINK WE'RE HOLDING THAT OPEN AND MOVING ON. OKAY THE NEXT US IN A BUDGET OPTION STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY NET THIS OUR FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. DID YOU MISTER ANDERSON YOU GONNA READ FOR US. BUT YOUR MUTUAL SIR. THERE WE GO THERE WE GO. GOOD AFTERNOON RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO READ- THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS FROM THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUSES BUDGET PROPOSAL. OF FIRST JUST TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR FOOD BANKS TO MEET INCREASED NEEDS DUE TO THE CONTINUED IMPACTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THIS REFLECTS PROPOSALS THAT WERE PUT FORTH. BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS AND HEARD DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S FEBRUARY NINTH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THE SECOND IS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. OR C. FAB TO SERVICE CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. THIS PROPOSAL SUPPORTS SB FOUR SIXTY FOUR FROM SENATOR PER TACO AND WAS HEARD DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S FEBRUARY NINTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE MISTER JERRY CALL HERE OUR SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR NOURISH CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS TOPIC. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO RECALL SENIOR ADVOCATE NURSE CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR PUTTING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE AARMING RATES OF FOOD INSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO WANT TO DO A LEVEL SAID AND EMPHASIZED THAT BEFORE THE CALL THE CRISIS WE HAVE REALLY HIGH RATES OF HUNGER AND POVERTY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST. CHILD POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION SO THESE ARE OUR LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS THAT ONLY WORSENED OVER THE PAST YEAR. LAST FALL OUR ORGANIZATION PARTNERED WITH RESEARCH FIRM TO CONDUCT A STATEWIDE STUDY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA DURING. DURING THECALL THE NINETEEN EMERGENCY WE'VE GOT A SURVEY OF A THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS SIX FOCUS GROUPS. WITH HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS THE STATE ALL EARNING LESS THAN FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND THOSE FINDINGS SHOW CLEARLY IN AND VERSION NEED TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO HOUSEHOLDS WHO COULDN'T MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS ESPECIALLY FOOD. I'LL SHARE SOME OF THOSE TOP LINE FINDINGS TODAY BUT I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE FULL REPORT AND OTHER RESOURCES IF THE COMMITTEES INTERESTED IN IN TAKING IN MORE DETAIL. THE MORE THAN THREE IN FIVE. SURVEY RESPONDENTS WORRIED ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF FOOD IN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. AND MORE THAN HALF. OF ALL SURVEY RESPONDENTS HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD WITHOUT MONEY TO GET MORE. HALF OVERALL 80% EXPRESSED SOME LEVEL OF NEED FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY TO BUY FOOD. BLACK AND LYFT NEXT CALIFORNIANS WERE MORE LIKELY TO RUN OUT OF FOOD AND OTHER RESPONDENTS IN PARENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO RUN REPORT RUNNING OUT OF FOOD AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN. FEDERAL AND STATE RELIEF EFFORTS WERE LARGELY SEEN AS HELPFUL BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. DURING THE. PANDEMIC CALFRESH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF. HIRELING OF CALFRESH AND OTHER ASSISTANCE ENTIRELY NOT THAT'S UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. TODAY THE CALIFORNIA BHAJAN POLICY CENTER RELEASED AN ANALYSIS SHOWING THAT AMONG CALIFORNIA CHILDREN IN FAMILIES WHERE ALL MEMBERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED OVER HALF LIVED IN POVERTY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AN ESTIMATED ONE THREE UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS AS A PARENT AND 90% LIVE WITH U. S. BORN CITIZEN CHILDREN A CURRENT CALFRESH POLICY TREATS THOSE PARENTS AS INVISIBLE. A POLICY DENIES THESE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THE POSITIVE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF CALFRESH IT'S A POLICY THAT DEEPENS DISPARITIES BASED ON SINA PHOBIA AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. A WIDE BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IN ADDITION TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCING HUNGER ACCESS TO CALFRESH IMPROVES OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IT ALSO REDUCES HEALTHCARE COSTS AND IMPROVE ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER PARTICIPANTS LIFETIME. SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR CONSIDERING THIS FOOD FOR ALL PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTANCE PROGRAM BEYOND A VERY NARROW SET OF QUALIFIED IMMIGRANTS IT'S SERVICE NOW. TO ALL CALIFORNIA HOW CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE DO COULD HAVE IMMIGRATION STATUS MAKING THAT CHANGE WOULD PERMANENTLY ADDRESS THE IMMIGRANT EXCLUSION IN THE STATE'S NUTRITION SAFETY NET CAN BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. TOWARD A FUTURE WHERE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE FOOD THEY NEED- ADDED OF COURSE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE FOOD BANK SPENDING REQUEST AS WELL AS THEY'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS CENTER STILL FACE THEY SEEM VERY. ELEVATED DEMANDS- THANKS IN AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE EVERYTHING IN. JUST RAISED BERMAN FINANCE NOTICED ALL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU YEAH- CAMINO THIS FOOD IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST OF FOR ME. ON THAT YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE FOR ALL ON HOUSING FOR ALL. BUT FOR GOODNESS SAKES WE CAN CERTAINLY START WITH FOOD FOR ALL. OF THAT SEEMS LIKE A BASIC THING THAT WE CAN DO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE GROW MORE THAN ANY PLACE ELSE- AND THEN WE CERTAINLY KNOW THAT THE- THE PANDEMIC HAS HIT OUR MOST. VULNERABLE EVE EVEN THE HARDEST INCLUDING THOSE WHO MAY BE HERE WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION BUT THEY LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY WORK IN OUR FIELDS THEY WORK IN OUR FACTORIES AND RESTAURANTS. AND GO AND GET AND THEIR KIDS GO TO SCHOOL WITH OUR KIDS SO. UP NOTHING STOPS AT ANYBODY'S BORDER AND HAS A- AS YOU SAID MR CALL. EVERY EVERY STUDY SHOWS THAT NUTRITION HAS WAY MORE IMPACTS THAN JUST FILLING UP A BELLY IT HELPS THE MIND IT HELPS. PEOPLE FEEL MORE SECURE. IT HELPS ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AND IT CERTAINLY HELPS OUTCOMES BOTH RIGHT AWAY AND LATER IN LIFE THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD END UP PAYING FOR ANYWAY. WE KNOW THAT PARENTS CAN FEED THEIR CHILDREN THEY FELT LESS STRESS AND OF PARENTS FOR LESS STRESS. THEIR CHILDREN DEVELOPING GROW BETTER SO. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS I'M PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND I'LL ASK DR PANE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS TOPIC. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOOD IS GOOD. A RIGHT. WHO DOES GOOD. A OKAY LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO THE NEXT SENATE BUDGET OPTIONS STRENGTHENING THE SAFETY NET CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

WHERE WE BROUGHT IN RESEARCHERS SHOWED AND DEMONSTRATED WHAT'S WHAT IMPACT WILL BE ON CHILDREN GREW UP AND ACTIVISTS REST HE- WARNED NON MISSION. ON I THINK THIS KIND OF RESEARCH REALLY HELPED DRIVE. THE LEGISLATURE AND EVENTUALLY THE GOVERNOR YOU ARE DOCTORS THREE STEP APPROACH TO GETTING THE GRANT UP ABOVE THE- MIDPOINT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. YEAH YES IT'S NOT THE PLACE THAT WE NEED TO STOP YOU NEED TO GO HIGHER BUT IT IS IMPORTANT MEASUREMENT AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE- SHOW ROOM THE LEVELS. ARE SO YOU. KNOW WE TOOK TWO STEPS. WORST FEARS. THE LAST ONE IN GOVERNOR BROWN'S LAST YEAR'S AND THE ONE WOULD GOVERNOR NEEDS.

ALL RIGHT SO IS CSS IS REQUESTING A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES MINISTER THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM WOULD FIND THE ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION ADULT AND SENIOR FOR DELIVERY. AS WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED TODAY IN HEARING THESE RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS. ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF HOUSING. HERE'S ABILITY. LOOTING FOR EXAMPLE INDIVIDUALS OF YOU KNOW HOW CHEN YOU HAVE NO ALL HOW OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR LEVEL OF CARE NEEDS ARE LIKELY TO COME HOME. ONCE AT THE SETTINGS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT THE FUNDS PROPOSED HERE WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COUNTY TRIED. THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM RESOURCE SO I COULD MENTION COMMITTEE HERE EXPANSION PROGRAM I. AT ONE POINT CORD CHEN FUND IN TWENTY ONE YOU AND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND GENERAL FUND. JUNE TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THIS INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CONTRACT FUNDING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION SERVICES SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION. YLIDES THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHICH SUPPORT CAN'T EVEN TRY TO DEVELOP GAP ANALYSES AND IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFUL CAPITAL FUND DISBURSEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE. TO CLOCK BURKE EVALUATION FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT MONITORING THAT FACILITY CREATION AND PRESERVATION EFFORT- THE GOAL OF COURSE THE- FUNDING. I'M WITH THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROGRAM STATUS OF WORK. THE WORK IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE- YEAH. ALL ALSO SHARE- BUT IN ADDITION BE COMMITTED EXPENSE REQUIRE YES ALSO REQUEST ONE THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITION FOR THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF THE STATE PROJECT ROOM KEY AND RE HOUSING STRATEGY I'M SO GLAD YOU KNOW HOW TO GREET YOU WAS ESTABLISHED IN RESPONSE. YOU RIGHT NANKANA SHELTERING JUST. AND MOTELS BURKE. IN THIS PARTICULAR POSITION IS NEEDED I TOOK FURTHER LEAD OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS WHICH NOW INCLUDES NINETY THAT DATA RECORDING ON ARE WE HOUSING EFFORTS AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HOWELLS. AGENCY RESPONSE PROJECT GREEN KEEP PAYING. ARE ARE ABLE TO TRANSITION TO STABLE HOUSING UPON EXIT RATHER THAN RETURNING. IN ADDITION THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE STATE. TO ALL OF THE FIFTY FIVE COUNTIES AND THREE TRIBES ARE OPERATING PROJECT ROOM KEY- WOULD BE A PART OF THIS PARTICULAR WALL AS WELL. AND TO ADD THAT STAFF WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS AND LEVERAGING REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAY IN WHICH HE'S NOT CONGREGATE SHELTERING. I THINK THAT AND BY CONTINUING TO WORK TO DO YOU LIKE COLLABORATION TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND EMERGING GUIDANCE WITH LOCAL PARTNERS AS WE MOVE OUT OF THE CAN. WHILE MAINTAINING THAT HOUSING STABILITY OF MANY INDIVIDUALS OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND I IN FACT HAVE BEEN SERVED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. I DURING DURING. AND ALSO. HE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DO HAVE ANYTHING ON THE- AT. YES THEY ACTUALLY STARTED AGAIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE REQUESTED STAFFING RESOURCES- BUT WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME BROADER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE- COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM PROPOSAL. IN PARTICULAR- WITHOUT DETAILED IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR THE PROGRAM- EXACTLY HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED AND OVERSEEN REMAINS UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME. SO IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER IT'S THE REQUESTED RESOURCE SAYS- WHAT INDEED BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PROGRAM HOWEVER WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND- DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS AS THOSE ARE DEVELOPED. IN ADDITION- WE WOULD NOTE THAT AS WE HEARD EARLIER DURING THIS HEARING AS PART OF THE SENATE BUDGET OPTIONS FOR AGING ISSUES THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO CONSIDERING FUNDING FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES- SERVING RESIDENTS RECEIVE SS I SS P. PAYMENTS. AND WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM LIKELY WOULD HAVE MANY SIMILARITIES TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM. SO DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THERE COULD BE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF STAFFING RESOURCES NEEDED- THEREFORE WE AGREE WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AT THIS TIME TO HOLD OPEN THE ISSUE WHILE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION- CONTINUE TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF STATE LEVEL SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED FOR ADULTS. AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND THEN BASED ON THAT PLAN WHAT STAFFING RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AT THE STATE LEVEL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS BECAME OFFICIAL. THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE FOR SOME IS HELPING PEOPLE TO GET THINGS UP TO. REINVESTMENT IN THE STRUCTURE OF THEM HOW MANY BEDS THOUGH DO WE ARE WE ARE WE JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE BEDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THESE FACILITIES ARE WE TRYING TO ADD TO THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE WHAT'S THE GOAL WITH THIS AND I THINK THAT CAN BETTER. HELP US SEE HOW IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF STAFF IF WE KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL THE ACTUAL GOAL FOR GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN APPROPRIATE LEVEL HOUSING LET ME SAY YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THE GOAL IS BOTH ATTITUDE IT'S TO COLD IT'S BOTH EXPAND THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES IN PARTICULAR FACILITIES ACCEPT. SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS ACROSS THE STATE WHILE ALSO PRESERVING THOSE SETTINGS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL- BUT MAY HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OTHER WE HAD NEEDS. THAT WITHOUT THIS FUNDING MAYBE I'M JUST. A LUCKY CLOSURE. OKAY BUT WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF MANY HOW MANY MORE BEDS THAT WERE TO ABOUT HOW MANY MORE ROOMS MUCH MARKET. THAT WE WANT TO BUILD INTO THE SYSTEM. WHAT DOES THAT WILL BE BASED ON NOT REALLY THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN. THOSE THAT DON'T THAT OF COURSE TO CREATE A NEW BAND IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN PRESERVING THOSE ARMS WILL BE BASED ON- BASED ON THAT BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THOSE TO USE THOSE. AND PART OF THE WORK WILL BE ABOUT YOU ON A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS. IT'S A PART OF THE PROPOSAL. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW COUNTIES ARE WORKING WITH THESE FACILITIES AND- AND HOW TO BEST GET THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN TERMS OF STATE INVESTMENT- THIS RESOURCE FOR PEOPLE. RIGHT HE- AND DO YOU KNOW IS A PLAN AT SOME POINT TO TAKE SOME OF THE HOTELS AND MOTELS WITH PROJECT ROOM KEY AND TURN THEM INTO. MORE LONGER TURN. OUR OF CAESAR AFC'S YEAH ABSOLUTELY HOTELS AND MOTELS WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE A LIKELY REAL ESTATE TYPE THAT COULD BE TRANSIT TRANSITION INTO ADULT AND SENIOR THE LADIES- AND OF COURSE A LOT HAS HAPPENED ALREADY THROUGH HOME CHIEF WHICH IS CURRENT. HELLO RIGHT HOUSING- YOU BRING UP OKAY WEIGHT THAT ANOTHER HOUSING TYPOLOGY ARE ASSISTED LIVING SETTINGS I'M COULD ALSO BE A GOOD. FOR THAT TYPE OF REAL ESTATE. OKAY BUT THANK YOU HI TECH VENTURA THINGS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE APPRECIATE IT M. AND NOW- ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN THE SENATE BUDGET OPTIONS ARE ON HOUSING. SHORT THANK YOU AGAIN HERE WE GO YES THAT'S ME AGAIN. THE SENATE IS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR A FLEXIBLE FUNDING POOL TO BE USED FOR COUNTY ADMINISTERED HOUSING PROGRAMS. THIS REFLECTS A PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS% ASSOCIATION HEARD IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S FEBRUARY NINTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEARING. HEY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK WE HAVE- ELLEN- BAND SKI THE DIRECTOR OF BUDGET AND FISCAL POLICY FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION HERE- TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL. THAT AFTERNOON THANK YOU- MY NAME IS EILEEN KAMINSKY AND THE WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TODAY. THE HOUSING CRISIS AFFECTS EVERY PROGRAM OUR MEMBERS RUN AND IT AFFECTS EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE. HOUSING INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS WERE ALREADY AT CRISIS LEVELS FOR OUR CLIENTS NOT SURPRISINGLY WE HAVE SEEN AN EVEN GREATER NEED FOR HOUSING SUPPORT AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE HEALTH RISKS OF HOMELESSNESS ALREADY GREAT BECAME EVEN MORE LIFE OR DEATH WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO COPE AT NINETEEN. ALSO WITH THE PANDEMIC CAME BOTH UNCERTAINTY AND CONSTANT CHANGE DOWNEY'S HAVE PIVOTED NUMEROUS TIMES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VARIOUS ONE TIME FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE VERY WELCOME BUT ALSO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO PLAN OR BEST FIGURE OUT HOW TO BLEND TOGETHER SERVICES FOR THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS WE OPERATE IN THE PEOPLE WE SERVE. WHILE WE APPLAUD THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND THE TALKS TO CONTINUE IT. IT HAS COMPOUNDED THE DIFFICULTIES WE ALREADY HAVE TO HELP OUR CLIENTS FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. LACK OF HOUSING STOCK IN AFFORDABLE RENTALS ARE REAL BARRIERS TO SECURING HOUSING. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESPERATE IMPACTS OF ONGOING HOUSING DIFFICULTIES DURING THE PANDEMIC EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE THOSE LIVING AND NONTRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT A FORMAL LEASE LIKE FAMILY MEMBERS CONVERTED GARAGES OR SHARING A HOME. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT SOMEONE WITH A FORMAL LEASE THE LANDLORD TO. AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO CAN STILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR NON PANDEMIC RELATED CAUSES AND THOSE EVICTIONS ARE ALREADY A PROBLEM WITHOUT THE ADDED LAYER OF THE PANDEMIC ON TOP OF IT. FAMILIES IN THESE SITUATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM MANY OF THE EXISTING PANDEMIC RELATED HOUSING ASSISTANCE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED SO FAR. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CRISIS THAT ADDICTION CREATES ALSO FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FAMILIES OF COLOR. IN EVIDENCE STRONGLY INDICATES THAT ADDICTION IS NOT JUST A CONDITION OF POVERTY IT IS A BECAUSE OF THAT- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS COUNTIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE STIRRED UP A NUMBER OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TIED DIRECTLY TO THE HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE. OUR PROPOSAL AS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA IS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS. TO BOOST THE SERVICES IN THOSE HOUSING PROGRAMS ARE MEMBERS ALREADY OPERATE FOR A CLIENT'S. COUNTIES CAN USE THESE PLANS LACKS A LEAD TO FILL GAPS IN FUNDING AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR CLIENTS. INCLUDING PREVENTION AGAINST HOUSING LOSS WHICH OUR CURRENT HOUSING PROGRAMS DO NOT ALL SUPPORT AS WELL AS WE'D LIKE. STABLE HOUSING IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ALL THE OTHER SUPPORTS WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE YOUR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS. WE CAN'T REUNIFY CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO LACK SHELTER. OR COUCH PERSON PARTICIPANTS CAN'T HOLD DOWN A JOB IF THEY'RE SLEEPING IN A CAR. ELDER AND DEPENDENT ADULT WHO NEED HELP FOR ABUSE AND NEGLECT ISSUES INCLUDING THE GROWING PROBLEM OF FINANCIAL ABUSE. ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO ILL HEALTH AND EVEN DIE IF THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES. COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS AND STAFF KNOW OUR CLIENTS AND UNDERSTAND WHEN SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED. BOTH TO SECURE HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS. AND TO HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND AVOID HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. HAVING RESOURCES AT THE READY TO ENSURE WE CAN QUICKLY PROVIDE THOSE SUPPORTS WITHIN OUR EXISTING HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO US. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR PROPOSAL AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION BE EVEN IF. WE HAVE MORE MONEY HOW'S YOUR SUPPLY. THAT'S A GREAT- AND THAT'S WHY PREVENTION REALLY IS KEY AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A- POUND OF CURE SO TO SPEAK- IF WE CAN. THROUGH A LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND BACK THOSE UP A LITTLE BIT AND CHEAP FOLKS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS FIRST PLACE- THAT WILL THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY. BUT IN ADDITION OUR PROPOSAL WOULD ENABLE COUNTIES. TO SECURE- EMERGENCY TEMPORARY SHELTER AS NEEDED- AS WELL AS SOME SHORTER TERM- HOUSING OPTIONS SO WE DO HAVE ON THE ABILITY. TO EXPAND THE WAY WE USE OUR FUNDS ARE THESE FUNDS AND OUR LEVERAGE OUR PROGRAMS TO TRY TO BUILD A LITTLE BIT MORE HOUSING STOCK AT LEAST ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR THE CLIENTS WE SERVE. GOOD IN AT LEAST TO CONTINUE ON IF PEOPLE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING VERY TEMPORARY THERE'S A PLAN TO NOT LEAVE THEM THERE. WHERE SITE AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY TRANSITION INTO SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT AS WELL AS THAT IS A PART OF IT. ALSO OKAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT POVERTY COMES WITH ALL KINDS A CORRESPONDING ISSUES THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE NEED EXTRA HELP TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN HOUSING AND TO MAKE THOSE TRANSITIONS. VERY MUCH YEAH. OKAY THE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- DESIRE FOR FLEXIBILITY AND SO FORTH WHAT- WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE REASONABLE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND IN THAT AFTER IT'S DONE I MEAN I THINK WE'D LIKE TO KNOW IN THE END YOU KNOW HOW WE ENDED UP SPENDING THE MONEY- AND- HOPEFULLY THAT GIVES US SOME LESSONS GOING TO THE FUTURE IS TO MAKING FUTURE INVESTMENTS SO. I CAN JUST SPEAK TO WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND- THE STATE WILL BE GETTING FOR ITS INVESTMENT SO WE ARE WE WANNA GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY REALIZE EVERY COUNTY HAS DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES SO FORTH BUT ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO HELP INFORM FUTURE DECISION MAKING SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO- WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT WE DO IN THAT REGARD. YEAH THANK YOU A DOCTOR PAM FOR THAT QUESTION- BECAUSE IT'S ONE CERTAINLY THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING AS WELL AND HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF OUR PROPOSAL- WE WEREN'T BEEN TALKING ALREADY TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT REPORTING JUST IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THOSE MEASURES- AND INFORMATION. THAT ARE REALLY THE MOST USEFUL- TO ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK THERE ARE SOMEBLOCKS THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF SOME OF THAT. I THINK A CHALLENGE FOR US IS I MEAN IDEALLY WE WOULD FOLLOW FOLKS LOGIC LONGITUDINALLY- THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE- STUDIES- IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE NECESSARILY CONTEMPLATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF GATHERING- DATE ON HOW WE USE THAT THE FUNDS HOW MANY PEOPLE WE SERVE WITH THE FUNDS WHAT KINDS OF OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF PLACEMENTS OR PREVENTIVE MEASURES- WE- WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH- AND REALLY OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT WHAT KINDS OF INFORMATION WE COULD GATHER. THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE IN- IN CONTINUING THIS FLEXIBILITY. AND THEY JUST THE ONE FOLLOW UP THE- WE STARTED THIS WHOLE HEARING TALKING ABOUT THE NEW INFORMATION SYSTEM CALC I THINK ACT WAS CALLED CARES OR. SOMETHING- V. YES HE W. S. CARES- D. AND AGAIN THAT HAS A VERY DIFFERENT PURPOSE BUT- WHAT CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO THE KIND OF DATA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE OR DON'T HAVE TO HELP US. TRY TO TRACK THE BENEFITS OF OUR VARIOUS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AS IS AS COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTOR- JUST AS A DISSOCIATION IN THE IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF. IT INFRASRUCTURE WE NEED TO HELP TRY TO TRACK RESULTS. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF A- A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WE DO IN ORANGE UNDER TRYING TO BUILD IN CHILD WELFARE- IT REALLY IS- VERY- KIND OF PROGRAM SPECIFIC REPORTING THAT WE DO COUNTY BY COUNTY THAT HAS BEEN GATHERED- AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT LEVEL. AND I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY THAT WE NEED TO BUILD A NEW SYSTEM TO GATHER DATA- BUT- I DO THINK THAT- HAVING SOME- CONSOLIDATION MAY BE OF THE DATA THAT WE'RE GATHERING SO WE GOT TO CONSISTENCY IN THE INFORMATION WE'RE GETTING FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS COULD BE IT COULD BE HELPFUL- AND WOULD BE- HAPPY TO TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT AND WORK WITH THEM MORE TO MAYBE FIGURE OUT WHAT. KINDS OF ON THINGS WE WOULD NEED TO SUPPORT ON GOOD DATA REPORTING- AND GATHERING OKAY SO THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING THAT IN THIS PROPOSAL WE THEN ADD A WHOLE YOU KNOW I. T. STRUCTURE TO THIS BUT I DO THINK THE RECEIPT THAT. SOME THOUGHT ABOUT- BASICALLY EVALUATION AND HOW HOPEFULLY GET SOME INFORMATION TO HELP SYSTEM FOR FUTURE INVESTMENTS. THAT I GUESS THE OTHER PART IS YOU KNOW IT'S PART IS ALSO THIS UNIT IN YOUR OWN TESTIMONY AS WELL AS WE HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE. YEAH WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT- OF NICE YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JUST ONE ISSUE RIGHT SO HOUSING THEN LEADS TO OTHER ISSUES OR OTHER ISSUES MAY LEAD TO POOR YOU KNOW. I HAVE ACCESS TO HOUSING. AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WE PROVIDE AT THE STATE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND SO FORTH- TRYING TO IDENTIFY LIKE HOW HOW THEY EITHER INTERSECTED DON'T INTERSECT GREAT SO WHERE WHERE PEOPLE GETTING HELP FROM WHERE DAY NOT GETTING HELP FROM. YELL AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING SERVED BY MULTIPLE PROGRAMS OR NOT WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND- JUST TRYING TO THINK A BIT ABOUT- THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. HOW WE DID A FIGHT. THAT SO WE CAN YOU KNOW BASICALLY DO BETTER INVESTMENTS A POLICY RIGHT. AND SO BE ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY SOME DATA NOT JUST ON THE PROGRAM'S LEVEL BUT KNOWING THAT ARE YOU KNOW THE SAME PERSONALLY SERVE THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO HELPING THAT PROGRAM ARE NOT. WOULD WOULD BE USEFUL. ANYWAY APPRECIATE DATA THAT THE THOUGHTS OF YOUR ASSOCIATION ON THAT AS WE CONTINUE FORWARD. THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY BUT THE IS IT A NEXT ITEMS BACK TO DATA OUR NEXT ITEMS BACK TO DATA THAT'S RIGHT US WERE NEXT ITEMS ISSUE EIGHT- S. WHOLE TRIAL INTEGRATION AND DATA DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS AND SALIM CHAU CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND I'LL BE GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF OUR DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR THIS PROPOSAL. WE ARE REQUESTING NINE POSITIONS. FIVE IN OUR LICENSING DIVISION ONE AND RESEARCH AND THREE POSITIONS IN OUR LEGAL DIVISION OR TOTAL ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THESE POSITIONS BUT SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH TRANSFERS SOCCER PROGRAMS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S MASTER CLEAR ON EARLY LEARNING CARE WHICH PROVIDES A RESEARCH BASED ROADMAP FOR BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE AND EQUITABLE. SYSTEM OVER THE NEXT DECADE- THE LATEST AND RESEARCH POSITION FOR BECAUSE- WITH STATE TO DESIGN DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A SHARED VISION. QUALITY AND EQUITY AND SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD BE PROVIDING TARGETED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BUILD CAPACITY AN EXPANSIVE HI EARLY LEARNING AND CHILD CARE TO SUPPORT A GLOBAL ACCESS. THE RESEARCH DIVISION DIVISION CONDITION WOULD PROVIDE A DEDICATED RESOURCE FOR DATA MANAGEMENT NINETY SYSTEM CONSOLIDATION IN COORDINATION. IMPLEMENTATION OVERSIGHT AND SOME LONG TERM PLANNING AS WELL. AND FINALLY THE AND POSITIONS WOULD PROVIDE LEGAL SUPPORT BETWEEN THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND LICENSING AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA CONTRACTS WORKS. I THINK THE ANY QUESTIONS- HELLO. ENGINEERING THANK. JUST A BRIEF COMMENT AND THIS APPLIES TO THE NEXT ITEM AS WELL- THIS IS JUST SAID NOTE THAT THIS- BUDGET REQUEST IS CONTINGENT ON THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTING- SEVERAL OTHER GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS RELATED TO SHIFTING THE ADMINISTRATION- PROGRAMS TO DSS- AS THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T TAKEN ACTION ON THOSE OTHER PROPOSALS WE CAN CARE WHAT THE STAFF. RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN FOR NOW AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONFORMANCE STAFFING LEVELS WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL AND IN THE NEXT WITH OTHER TRANSITION RELATED DECISIONS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. THANK WE APPRECIATE THAT MISTER ANDERSON THE DIFFERENT FINANCE. HELLO SAY LET OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS MOMENT. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELCOME YOU GOT ASKING FOR DATA POSITIONS ON SOMETHING WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT YET BUT WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION DR PAN HAVE SOUGHT IT'S JUST A QUICK QUESTION RELATES ABOUT THIS AND I GUESS THE NEXT ONE TO USE- BUT IT SO CERTAINLY SKID SEE THE NEED FOR THESE POSITIONS IF WE MOVED OUT THERE ALL OVER TO CDSS AND- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT SINCE EDUCATION SALE BY DIFFERENT SUB COMMITTEE IS THERE THEN IF WE DO DO THAT IS- A REDUCTION POSITIONS OVER IN C. E. R. SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW WHAT THE NET IS OUR DUTY OF THE TRANSFERRING PEOPLE OVER SIGNED I REALIZE YOUR POSITIONS. OR TRANSFERRING PEOPLE OVER FROM C. D. E. WHO USED TO BE DOING THAT WORKERS CAN SOMEONE MAYBE PERHAPS SPEAK TO- SO I WOULD JUST SEEM TO ONE SIDE OF IT SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE WE SAVING MONEY ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THESE THE SAME PEOPLE. WHO ARE JUST COMING OVER THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I THINK ISSUE MR. SURE SO THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL REQUEST- IT IS IN OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAD WHAT WE REFERTO AS OUR RETENTION PROPOSAL THAT WOULD- JEANS FOR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE POINT SEVEN TRANSITIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SOCIAL SERVICES SO THIS WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS THAT WERE NOT A PART OF THAT INITIAL TRANSFER AND WHEN I.STOP. TO SUPPORT THIS ADDITIONAL EFFORT. INTEL DO YOU SEE YOU SEE THAT IT WITH IT MOVING OVER TO CDS IT'S S. THE PARCEL SERVICES THAT- THAT YOU WOULD NEED MORE CAPACITY- ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE OR IS THIS PART OF A LARGER EFFORT TO CHANGE TO IMPROVE OUR CHANGER- CHILD CARE. AS WE MOVE IT OVER TO SOCIAL SERVICES. THIS IS- POSITIONS THAT DO SUPPORT CAPACITY- IN IN THE NEXT ISSUE WE WILL BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AS WELL. IN ADDITION WE DO HAVE SOME LONG TERM PLANNING THAT WE HAVE FOR. THE DATA. ROAD MAP AS MENTIONED WITH THE MASTER PLAN SO THESE ARE ALL EFFORTS THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST- WITH THAT EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROGRAMS TODAY. BUT WOULD SUPPORT THE TRANSITION AND SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE. I GUESS I WOULD JUST KIND THAT IT WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE TREES RIGHT NOW WILL BE GOOD IDEA TO GET A BETTER LOOK AT THE FOREST AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

DID NOT IDENTIFY ALL OF THE LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT POSITIONS. THAT ARE NEEDED FOR CDSS TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSFER WHILE ALSO ALLOWING CDP TO CONTINUE IN ITS RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE OPERATIONS OF STATE PRESCHOOL SO THIS IS THE- REMAINING POSITIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS NECESSARY FOR CDSS TO ENSURE BOTH NO DISRUPTION OF SERVICES DUE TO THE TRANSFER. AND TODAY- SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD TOWARD FUTURE SUCCESS- AS WE IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS SO THIS- THIS REQUEST INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY POSITIONS THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THEY'RE INTENDED TO CREATE SOME BALANCE STAFFING RATIOS AND MAKE SURE AGAIN THAT WE HAVE NO DISRUPTIONS IN THE SYSTEM SO EIGHTEEN OF THE POSITIONS- WOULD BE LOCATED IN OUR NEW.
