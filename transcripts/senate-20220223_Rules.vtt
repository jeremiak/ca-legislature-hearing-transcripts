INFORMATION COMES FORWARD AND

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:43.776
YOU WANT TO WORK WITH THE

00:15:43.842 --> 00:15:45.644
LEGISLATORS I APPRECIATED THAT.

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:48.781
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:49.815
QUESTIONS THAT BUILD ON OUR-

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:51.483
VERY ODD. INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.886
YESTERDAY AND I WONDER IF THE

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.954
CLAIMS PROCESSING- WE DID RUN

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.956
INTO ISSUES WITHOUT.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.591
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.393
THERE WERE MANY THINGS AWAY IN

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.228
THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. SO THE

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:06.865
QUESTION IS- HELLO- HOW ARE WE

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.801
GOING TO BE SURE THAT WAS STATE

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:10.536
DISABILITY INSURANCE SB I IF

00:16:10.602 --> 00:16:11.970
IT'S USING THE SAME COMPUTER

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:14.506
PROCESSOR. THAT WE WON'T START

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:16.308
TO RUN INTO SOME SIGNIFICANT.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.277
FRAUD ISSUES THERE AND I KNOW A

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:19.912
FEWHAVE MEMBERS NOT NOT TO THE

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:21.246
EXTENT THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH YOUR

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.315
A. B. THAT COULD YOU SHARE A

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.350
LIBERATE CONVEYED YOU DID

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:26.085
RESPOND TO THAT BUT- ABURRIDA

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:30.489
LITTLE. ON THE PUBLIC RECORD I

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:31.056
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.424
CONSTITUENTS. ALSO SENATOR AND

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:34.326
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.628
FRAUD IS NO FRAUD OF THE

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:38.263
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.499
HERE IN OUR STATE AND ACROSS.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.268
ALL OF OUR STATE. HAS BEEN TOP

00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:46.338
OF MIND FOR MANY. AND AS WE KNOW

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:48.874
IDENTITY FRAUD IT IS ONE OF THE

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.008
BIGGEST VULNERABILITIES THAT WE

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.144
HAVE AS A SOCIETY TODAY

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.380
UNFORTUNATELY. AND THE PANDEMIC

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:56.448
ON COVERED A LOT OF THIS HERE IN

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:57.916
OUR STATE WITH OUR UNEMPLOYMENT

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.219
INSURANCE SYSTEM. AND THE

00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.654
PROCESSING. THERE ARE FOUR KEY

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:05.691
ACTIONS THAT WE TALK DURING THE

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:07.059
PANDEMIC AND THAT WE ARE

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:10.195
CONTINUING TO REVISE AND REVIEW

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:16.602
CURRENTLY- TO COMBAT FRAUD. THE

00:17:16.668 --> 00:17:18.504
FIRST ONE WAS EARLY ON IN THE

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.206
PANDEMIC WE CONTRACTED WITH

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:24.843
THOMSON REUTERS TO PROVIDE. US

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.413
SOME DATA ANALYSIS AND FILTERS

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:29.848
THAT WE COULD USE TO IDENTIFY

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:32.718
POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.720
THAT PROCESS EVOLVED OVER TIME

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.155
NOT SO THOSE FILTERS HAVE

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:37.456
EVOLVED AND THEY ARE STILL IN

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.091
PLACE AND THEY'RE VERY HELPFUL

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.959
IN IDENTIFYING FRAUD THAT ISN'T

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:43.429
ALWAYS IDENTITY FRAUD COULD BE

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:45.431
OUT OF STATE FRAUD THERE COULD

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:47.099
BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FRAUD THAT

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.001
THESE FILTERS HELP US IDENTIFY.

00:17:49.067 --> 00:17:51.336
THE SECOND IS A TOOL IT'S A

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:53.071
TECHNOLOGY TOOL THAT MANY

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:55.007
AGENCIES HAVE STARTED TO USE

00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.074
BOTH IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.010
AND WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND THAT

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:00.779
IS IT NEED. SO I DO NEED IS

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:04.516
FOCUSED ON THE FRONT END TO OUR

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.752
VERIFY IDENTITIES OF INDIVIDUALS

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.954
THAT ARE. SUBMITTING CLAIMS FOR

00:18:09.021 --> 00:18:11.156
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND SO

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:15.561
THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY. CONTROL

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:18.797
LEVELS OF FRAUD OF. THE THIRD.

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.900
LARGE PIECE IS THAT THE- EDT THE

00:18:21.967 --> 00:18:24.336
DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY PUT

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:26.672
TOGETHER A FRAUD A UNITS SO THIS

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:28.474
IS A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.809
WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE ASSESSING.

00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:33.178
THE ANALYTICS THE DATA AROUND

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:35.814
OUR CLAIMS TRYING TO STAY AHEAD

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.717
AND NOT BE REACTIVE TO NEW

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:42.721
ATTACKS OF FRAUD. AND FOURTH BOB

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:44.056
VERY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT WE

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:46.091
HAVE CONTRACTED WITH FORMER U.

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:48.293
S. ATTORNEY MCGREGOR SCOTT AND

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.363
HIS ROLE HAS BEEN TO HELP US

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.734
MOVE FRAUDULENT- OF. EVIDENCE

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:57.236
THAT WE HAD INTO THE HANDS OF

00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:00.672
LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LAW

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:03.542
ENFORCEMENT SO THAT THOSE

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.410
INDIVIDUALS CAN BE PROSECUTED.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.879
SO THAT IS ON THE BACK AND THE

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:08.247
ACTUAL PROSECUTION OF THE

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.515
CRIMINAL FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:11.183
OCCURRING DOMESTICALLY AS WELL

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.352
AS INTERNATIONALLY. AND SO IN

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:16.722
TERMS OF D. II WE TALK A LITTLE

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.291
BIT ABOUT THIS. WE ARE THESE OF

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.425
SORTS OF FEATURES ARE NOT IN

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.061
PLACE OUR SYSTEMS ARE VULNERABLE

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:25.564
TO FRAUD AND SO WE HAVE A LOOK

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.399
AT OUR BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:30.202
SYSTEMS BUT DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:32.271
IS ONE OF THEM AND WE ARE.

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:35.374
IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THESE PIECES

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.175
INTO THE DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.211
PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO VERY

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:41.313
VULNERABLE TO THESE SORTS OF

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.184
IDENTITY THEFT FRAUD- I WOULD OF

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.153
COURSE YOU KNOW WANT TO STATE

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.255
THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY REVIEWING

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.456
AND ASSESSING WHAT FRAUD LOOKS

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:53.792
LIKE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.227
NEED TO PUT NEW TOOLS IN PLACE

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.062
OR YOU KNOW WE THINK OUR

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:58.864
STRATEGIES WE ARE DOING SO WE'RE

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.433
TRYING TO DO THAT IN REAL TIME

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.501
SO THAT WE'RE NOT BEHIND THE

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.036
CURVE. GREAT ANSWER AND

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:06.138
APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE THINKING

00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:07.172
OF THE PRESIDENT AND THEN.

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:09.341
TAKING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED I

00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:11.176
GUESS INTO THE FUTURE. THERE HAS

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.078
BEEN AN ISSUE REYES THAT THE

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:16.615
VISUAL ARTS. RECOGNITION CONDIT-

00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.317
I THINK GOING FORWARD. CREATE

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.152
SOME PRIVACY ISSUES I'M NOT SURE

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:22.487
IF YOU'RE VERY OUT WITH. HAVING

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:23.455
SOME SORT OF CHALLENGE ON THAT

00:20:23.522 --> 00:20:25.157
BUT IT JUST IT'S VERY VERY

00:20:25.223 --> 00:20:27.125
RECENT THAT HAS EMERGED BECAUSE

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:29.161
IT'S BEING USED MORE. SO ANY

00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.495
THOUGHT FOUND OUT WHY NO WE

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:31.897
DIDN'T DISCUSS THAT THAT TIME

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.900
HAVE YOU HAD A JOB FROM- I GIVEN

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:41.039
THE ISSUES RAISED ON OUT ALREADY. YES I'VE SENATOR AND WE ARE

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:42.474
WORKING WITH. OUR PARTNERS OTHER

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.942
STATES AND LOOKING AT WHAT THE

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.545
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING WHEN

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:48.080
IT COMES TO ID ME AND THE FACIAL

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:50.382
RECOGNITION TOOL. THAT ALLOWS AN

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:53.619
INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE A SELFIE-

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.887
AND- AND SO THAT THE TECHNOLOGY

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:59.024
CAN QUICKLY CROSS REFERENCE THAT

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.959
ADDITIONAL IDENTIFICATION WITH

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.728
OTHER FORMS OF IDENTIFICATION.

00:21:02.794 --> 00:21:05.497
ARE WE ARE ASSESSING CURRENTLY

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.565
OUT WHETHER WE WANT TO MOVE IN

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.166
THE DIRECTION THAT THE IRS HAS

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:09.735
MOVED WHICH IS ACTUALLY

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:12.437
PROVIDING OPTIONALITY FOR USERS

00:21:12.504 --> 00:21:15.540
OF ID ME. WHERE THEY CAN CHOOSE

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:16.842
TO CONTINUE WITH FACIAL

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.910
RECOGNITION. OR THEY CAN CHOOSE

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.812
NOT TO OPT INTO THAT AND THERE

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:23.015
WILL BE AN ALTERNATIVE WAY OF

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.050
VERIFYING IDENTITY WHICH IS WITH

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.786
A LIVE INTERMEDIARY. THAT COMES

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:30.889
ON AND- VERIFIES THE IDENTITY OF

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.324
THE PERFECT PERSON WITHOUT A

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.292
SELFIE HAVING TO BE TAKEN.

00:21:34.359 --> 00:21:35.961
INTEREST WE ARE EVALUATING

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:37.929
CURRENTLY ASSESSING THOSE

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:40.132
OPTIONS. AND IRIS IS USING THAT

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:42.100
INTERESTING. LAST QUESTION I

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.735
THINK WE DID DISCUSS THIS

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:45.804
BECAUSE IT'S VERY. CONCERNING TO

00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:47.572
YOU AGAIN OUR TO OUR SMALLER

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.307
BUSINESSES THE UNIT. THE

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:51.410
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND OUT

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.378
TO HAND OUT YOU WITH HUGE WITH

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:55.347
THE GREAT RECESSION TOOK A

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:57.549
DECADE TO RETIRE. OUR COMING AT

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.317
IT AGAIN MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.920
SOME OF OUR OUR CONVERSATION AND

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:03.522
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT AGAIN.

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:05.891
BOB WHAT TO REITERATE THAT WE

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:07.292
BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.994
THE CURRENT SURPLUS AND I THINK

00:22:09.061 --> 00:22:10.696
THAT THAT WOULD HELP. AT LEAST

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.998
IN THE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD

00:22:13.065 --> 00:22:14.866
OF REDUCE THAT BURDEN THAT THAT

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:16.234
WOULD BE IN PARTICULAR ON THE

00:22:16.301 --> 00:22:17.869
SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT IS.

00:22:17.936 --> 00:22:19.705
CLEARLY THE BASE AND I DISTRICTS

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.807
SO YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AGAIN

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:27.713
FOR ALL YOU. KNOW PUBLIC.

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:29.114
DISCUSSION I'M CENTER YES THE

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.417
QUESTION OF- YOU I SAW IN SPEED.

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.086
COMES UP AGAIN AND- AND THERE'S

00:22:34.152 --> 00:22:35.954
SORT OF TWO TO THREE I WOULD

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.356
LIKE TO ADDRESS- I. OF COURSE

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.092
YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS PUTTING

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.294
IN HIS BUDGET IS PROPOSING THREE

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.962
POINT ONE BILLION TO PAY DOWN

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.198
THE FEDERAL DEBT THAT WE HAVE.

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:49.434
FOR YOU I TRUST FUND AND I OF

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:50.268
COURSE FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:53.171
RIGHT STEP- IN SHOWING. THE

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:55.474
SUPPORT TO OUR BUSINESSES IN

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.509
STARTING TO PAY THAT DOWN. OUT

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:59.344
WHAT THAT WILL DO IS IT'LL

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.179
SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT

00:23:01.246 --> 00:23:04.516
THE STATE OWES THIS DEBT TO THE

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:05.584
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE OTHER

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.518
ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:07.319
CONVERSATION WHICH I REALLY

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:09.187
APPRECIATED IT WAS SORT OF THE

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:10.956
LONGER THE LONGER TERM VISION.

00:23:11.022 --> 00:23:14.292
AND SORT OF FACING THE REALITY

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:18.597
THAT. WHEN THERE ARE ECONOMIC OF

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:20.298
CRISES YOU KNOW SUCH AS THE

00:23:20.365 --> 00:23:21.900
GREAT RECESSION AND WORE THE

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:24.503
PANDEMIC WHICH WAS TREMENDOUS IN

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.690
YOU WERE SENATOR EARLIER BUT-

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.492
REQUIRES EDT TO DEVELOP A

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.927
RECESSION PLAN TO PREPARE FOR AN

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.195
INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.796
INSURANCE COMPENSATION BENEFITS

00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:41.099
CLAIMS WHEN THERE'S AN ECONOMIC

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:44.135
RECESSION. NOW LAST TIME WAS NOT

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:45.870
QUITE LIKE WE ARE EXPERIENCING

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:47.205
THIS TIME SO YOU MIGHT THINK

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:48.640
GOING FORWARD WILL OF COURSE

00:31:48.706 --> 00:31:50.508
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE

00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.110
RECESSION AND HAVE A BETTER PLAN

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.544
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN SO

00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:55.747
OVERWHELMED AT THIS TIME. HOW

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.315
COULD WE NOT HAVE A YOU KNOW

00:31:57.382 --> 00:31:58.750
KIND OF COVERED THE BASE FOR A

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.852
FUTURE RECESSION THAT PROBABLY

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:01.853
WOULD IN NO WAY MATCH THIS ONE

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:04.289
BUT I JUST KINDA WANT TO SENSE

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:05.156
OF YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:06.491
UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE STILL. ALL

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.960
THIS HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:11.863
THE NEXT TOM AND GIVE ME YOUR

00:32:11.929 --> 00:32:13.831
THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW YOU'RE

00:32:13.898 --> 00:32:15.833
PROCEEDING FORWARD TO KIND OF

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.001
PUT THAT IN PLACE SO WE DON'T

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:20.438
HAVE A NEXT TIME TO THIS. DEGREE

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:22.874
I'M CENTER YOU THANK FOR YOUR

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.743
CALL. YOU KNOW FOR ME ONE OF THE

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.179
DANGERS- THAT WE HAVE IN

00:32:28.246 --> 00:32:30.281
GOVERNMENT MANY TIMES IS SORT OF

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:31.616
AND LEISURE OF WHAT HAPPENED

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:34.218
BEFORE. AND SO WHEN WE BOUNCE

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:37.455
BACK. AND THINGS NORMALISE AND

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:39.490
WE'RE IN WHAT WE CALL SORT OF

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:42.060
THE STEADY STATE OPERATIONS WE

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:44.996
OFTEN BEGIN TO EITHER BECAUSE

00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:47.532
THERE IS A NEED TO CUT BACK. ON

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:49.734
FUNDING OR BECAUSE THEY WERE RE

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:52.103
PRIORITIZATION. WE START CUTTING

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.572
BACK ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:57.442
NEED. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:58.443
MEET THE DEMANDS THAT WERE

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.611
CAUSED BY A RECESSION. SO THAT

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.213
TO ME IS ONE OF THE DANGERS THAT

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.582
WE NEED TO AVOID AS WE ARE

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:08.086
COMING OUT. OF THIS RECESSION

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:10.355
AND WORKING THROUGH THIS

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:13.424
CONTINUE. WORKLOAD THAT WE HAVE

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:17.161
AN EDT. THE OTHER THING THAT I

00:33:17.228 --> 00:33:19.497
WOULD SAY IS ALL OF THESE

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:22.066
LESSONS LEARNED THEY DO HAVE TO

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.601
BE CAPTURED IN A RECESSION

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:24.836
PLANET SO I THINK SENATOR

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:29.006
LAYERED. YOU THE SENATE BILL AND

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:30.942

RECESSION PLAN FOR THE

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:35.179
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM.

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:36.614
CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW AND WERE

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:39.884

OUR OUR PIECES THAT WE ARE GOING

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:53.264

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:54.332
THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.933
WORK THROUGH BASED ON THE STATE

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.702
AUDITOR'S REPORT AND THE

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:58.970
RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE GOVERNOR

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:02.607
STRIKE- STRENGTH TEAM. AND A LOT

00:34:02.673 --> 00:34:04.275
OF IT HAS TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:06.310
MODERNIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY SO

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:08.279
THAT IT IS MORE NIMBLE SO THAT I

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:11.783
CAN ADAPT TO CHANGING NEEDS AND

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:14.118
REQUIREMENTS AND THE OTHER PIECE

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.588
OF IT IS. THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY

KEY BETTER ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:29.033
BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WHEN

WHEN THESE CRISES HIT AGAIN

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.913
WHICH OF COURSE THEY WILL. WE

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.448
WANT TO LEAVE EDT AND THE

THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED.

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:08.058
EARLIER AND- AND I BELIEVE THIS

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.761
WAS ADDRESSING SENATOR BEATS

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.396
QUESTION ABOUT THE SAME TOPIC.

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:13.764
WAS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:17.134
WAYS TO. APPROACH AND THINK

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.769
ABOUT THE U. I TRUST FUNDS. AND

00:47:18.835 --> 00:47:22.039
THERE ARE MANY MODELS OUT THERE-

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:24.174
FROM OTHER STATES AND WHAT THEY

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.843
HAVE DONE. THAT WE COULD LOOK

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.713
AT. AND SO WHEREAS WE MIGHT BE

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.516
BUCKET MORE. IN THE CATEGORY OF

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:34.618
A PAY AS YOU GO STATE. WE DON'T

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.453
COLLECT THAT MUCH UP FRONT. AND

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.955
THEN UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE HAVE

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:42.559
RECESSIONS. WE END UP HAVING TO-

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:45.162
TAX EMPLOYERS TO COVER THAT

00:47:45.229 --> 00:47:48.432
DEBT. THERE ARE OTHER MODELS.

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:49.833
THERE ARE MODELS THAT THINK MORE

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.938
ABOUT FORWARD FUND. A LITTLE

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.240
MORE AND YOU'RE YOU'RE A HAVE A

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.141
BETTER AT RISK. SO THAT YOU HAVE

00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:01.712
. THIS US IN AND- DURING. AND

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.313
THERE ARE EVEN MODELS THAT GO

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.082
WAY BEYOND THIS WHERE THERE

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:07.284
CALPERS CYCLICAL AND THEY BUILD

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:10.020
UP VERY LARGE RESERVES. AND

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:12.623
ACTUALLY TRY TO REDUCE THE TAX

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.925
BURDEN ON EMPLOYERS. WHEN THERE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.827
ARE RECESSIONS AND WHEN THEY MAY

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:20.230
NEED THAT TAX RELIEF THE MOST SO

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:24.534
ALL TO SAY THERE ARE MANY MODELS

00:48:24.601 --> 00:48:26.303
AND WE ARE HERE TO HELP. ARE YOU

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.039
AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AS YOU THINK

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:31.441
THROUGH THIS ISSUE UP WITH

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.810
ANALYSIS DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER

00:48:33.877 --> 00:48:37.414
STATES- EXAMPLES OF WHAT IS OUT

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:39.516
THERE OR EVEN ANALYSIS ON HOW

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:42.619
CHANGES COULD IMPACT. THE STATE

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:46.223
AND OUR EMPLOYERS. THANK YOU AM

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:49.526
UP SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T- I

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:51.061
DON'T RECALL DISCUSSING IT ABOUT

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:53.096
TAXING EMPLOYERS MORE AND

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.197
CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.800
HIGHEST I MEAN WE'RE ACTUALLY-

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.969
ALMOST 5% HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:01.104
STATE SO TO INCREASE HER IS

00:49:01.171 --> 00:49:03.006
AGAIN. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:06.076
VIABLE SOLUTION- I'D I'D LIKE

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.277
AND I DON'T RECALL THAT BEING

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.378

AT THAT CAN I APPLAUD THE

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.486

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.255
BILLION DOLLARS THAT HE ALLOWED

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.957
FOR A PAYMENT AND TO HELP WITH

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:22.659
THE SITUATION THAT WAS CAUSED.

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:25.028
AN OVER THE PANDEMIC PERIOD FOR

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:27.164

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.366
INSOLVENT A I APPRECIATE YOUR

RESPONSE I HAVE- ANOTHER

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.204
QUESTION THAT I WANT TO TALK TO

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.472
THAT WE BRIEFLY TALKED ABOUT THE

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.040
ELLERBEE THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:39.009
RELATIONS BOARD. THAT TAKES ON

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.778
ISSUES- WAGING OUR ISSUES AND

00:49:41.845 --> 00:49:43.580
THINGS LIKE THAT FOR FARMWORKERS

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.549
AND THEY'RE KIND OF UNDER YOUR

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.951
PURVIEW BUT NOT REALLY THERE AN

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:50.153
INDEPENDENT- BOARD BUT THEY HAVE

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.955
SOME TYPE OF OVERSIGHT THROUGH

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.990
THE DEEP AS SECRETARY OF LABOR

00:49:54.057 --> 00:49:56.860
TRUE OR NOT TRUE. YES SO THE

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.528
AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS

00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:01.865
BORDER AT THE A. R. B. E. IS AN

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:03.834
INDEPENDENT BOARD THAT FALLS

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:07.337
UNDER- THE LABOR FAMILY OF

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:09.406
GROUPS OF PANELS BOARDS AND

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:11.274
DEPARTMENTS WE SAY IT'S

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.476
INDEPENDENT BECAUSE IT'S

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.745
DECISIONS WHEN THERE ARE CASES

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:16.079
BROUGHT TO THE BOARD ARE

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:20.083
INDEPENDENCE OF MY INFLUENCE FOR

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.618
ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S INFLUENCE

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.586
SO YOU HAVE THE THESE ARE

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:24.688
INDEPENDENT- DECISIONS THAT'S

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.990
WHAT THAT'S- WHY IT IS AWARD.

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:31.228
HOWEVER THE ROLE OF THE LRB IS

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.863
SPECIFICALLY IN THE SPACE OF

00:50:32.929 --> 00:50:36.099
LABOR- RELATIONS WITHIN THE

00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:43.974
AGRICULTURAL OF LANDSCAPE. SO IT

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.844
IS NOT. LIKE D. DIVISIONS WHICH

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.045
ARE FOLK ON SAFETY AND HEALTH.

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:50.547
AS WELL AS WE AND OUR AND

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.682
OVERTIME. AND RETALIATES. SO IT

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:55.051
IS A VERY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED

00:50:55.118 --> 00:51:00.524
ON. LABOR RELATIONS- ISSUES AND

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.193
PROCESSES FOR WORKERS AND

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.661
EMPLOYERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:08.198
INDUSTRY. SO I JUST WANT TO

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.800
CLARIFY THAT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.101
SEPARATE FROM THE SECRETARY OF

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:14.337
LABOR'S AT. OVERSIGHT NEAR

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:18.608
DECISIONS ARE SEPARATE FROM ME

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:20.010
YES OF COURSE THEY ARE

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.478
INTEGRATED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.848
EVER WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOU

00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:26.383
KNOW SUPPORTING EMPLOYERS IN A

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.485
DIFFERENT WAY OR WORKERS THEY

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:30.387
WOULD KNOW ABOUT IT-

00:51:30.454 --> 00:51:32.122
PARTICULARLY IF IT HAS TO DO

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.423
WITH THE AGRICULTURAL SPACE THEY

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.459
THOUGHT THEY DON'T FOCUS ON THE

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:39.429
SAFETY HEALTH OR WAGES AND HOURS

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.798
ARE CONDITIONS OF WORK ISSUES

00:51:41.865 --> 00:51:43.133
THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.801
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OVERSEAS.

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:46.303
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:48.205

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.339
PART OF THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:52.209
GENERAL ACT AND I LEFT YOUR

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:53.410
RESPONSE THAT YOU WERE SURPRISED

00:51:53.477 --> 00:51:55.078
AT THAT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:56.379
THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS THAT

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:58.648
TYPE OF LIFE HE DID SAY I THINK

00:51:58.715 --> 00:51:59.249
TWO OR THREE OTHER STATES ARE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:02.486
LOOKING AT IT. AND THAT AT THAT

00:52:02.552 --> 00:52:05.322
CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY ONE THAT

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.389

ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. OF WHICH

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:20.770
WOULD- IN ADDITION TO REFORM IN

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:21.371
THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:23.907
ACT WHICH HAS HUGE AN INTENSIVE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.609
KERR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.277
BOTH THE EMPLOYEE AND THE

EMPLOYER IT DOES DRASTICALLY

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.848
ENTHUSIASTICALLY BENEFIT ALL

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.632
IN THE ATTORNEY KIND OF WALKED

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:51.902
SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS OF THESE

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:54.404
CASES IS THE GENERAL WAY HAPPENS

00:52:54.471 --> 00:52:55.071
WHICH CAUSED. US IS THE

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:57.607
LEGISLATURE TO RESPOND IN ACTED

BRING SETTLEMENTS TO THE DIR AND

00:52:59.943 --> 00:53:01.444
VENDA DIR SO THERE WERE

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.246
SETTLEMENTS COULD BE REVIEWED SO

00:53:03.313 --> 00:53:04.681
THAT THE D. I. R. COULD STEP IN

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:06.416
AND SAY NO MISTER ATTORNEY

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:07.350
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:08.785
MILLION WELL THESE MILLION

00:53:08.852 --> 00:53:09.653
DOLLARS WHILE THESE EMPLOYEES

IF OR SHOULD THIS BALLOT MEASURE

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:20.330
PASS AND IT WOULD BRING MORE

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.131
RESPONSIBILITY LABOR

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:22.766
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE SO IF IT

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.301
DOES PASS SHOULD IT PASS HAVE

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.569
YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT ON HOW

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:27.203
THIS WOULD IMPACT THE AGENCY AND

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.104
SPECIFICALLY THE LABOR

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:33.143
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE- BECAUSE.

EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SO THIS IS

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:38.181
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE EVALUATING

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:40.850

THE FACT THAT WE HAD A CHANCE TO

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:47.470

OWN DEPARTMENTS ON THEIR OWN-

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.888
BUT WHEN I GOT TO D. G. S. AND I

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.190

FOR BIT OF DISSENSION-

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.248
CERTAINLY- I IDEAS OF MAYBE WE

COVERED. IN THE MEDIA-

01:18:01.209 --> 01:18:03.378
EXTENSIVELY AND I AM I THINK OUR

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.080
CONCERN IS IF THERE ARE

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.715
SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.650
THE STATE FROM POOR PERFORMANCE

01:18:08.717 --> 01:18:10.552
BY A COMPANY THAT'S UNDER. A NO

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:15.857
DOUBTS ONE THAT GETS RENEWED

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:17.626
WITHOUT ANY REAL OR- YEAH. OVER

HAVE AVOIDED DOLLARS SOME OF THE

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:27.869
SCANDALOUS PHOTO. REPORTS OF

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.838
COMMON A FEW OF THEM I THINK

01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.306
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME REAL

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.542
CONCERN IN AN EMERGING OF.

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:35.844
CREDIBILITY ISSUE- CERTAINLY IN

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:37.546
THE DURING THE PANDEMIC I'M

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:39.514
GOING FORWARD. SO IF YOU ALL

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:41.049

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:43.452
YOU WILL. BE DOING TO TAKE A

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:45.921

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.259
ON NO BID APPROACHES SOMETIMES.

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.661
HAVING SERVED A LITTLE LOCAL

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:53.462
GOVERNMENT AND STATE

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.263
GOVERNMENTS. UNDERSTAND THAT

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.365

SOMETIMES THOSE CERTAINLY UNDER

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.204
BUDGET. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.672
KNOW ON THOSE STANDARDS THAT ARE

01:19:03.738 --> 01:19:05.373

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.447
CERTAINLY I THINK A VERY

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:13.582

WORK WE'VE BEEN VERY TIMELY WE

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:56.075
WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION

SEAMLESSLY THROUGH TELEWORK-

02:01:58.277 --> 02:01:59.578
WHAT I NEED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:01.313

USED TO ENGAGING WITH THEM IN

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:11.424
PERSON AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:12.692
NATURE OF ALSO THE ARCHITECTURE

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:13.859
PROFESSION IS GATHERING PEOPLE

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:15.194
AROUND THE TABLE AND SOLVING

02:02:15.261 --> 02:02:17.263
PROBLEMS TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN

ABLE TO DO THAT SUCCESSFULLY VIA

02:02:19.331 --> 02:02:21.801
TELEWORK BUT I THINK THAT- THERE

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.936
IS A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES OF THE

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:26.706
NEW PATIENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY- IT

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:27.907
MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT

FOR COMMUNICATING ON PHONES BUT

02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:49.128
I STILL THINK THAT IT'S THE

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:51.430
NATURE OF ALL OF US TO REALLY

02:02:51.497 --> 02:02:53.099

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:25.885
BUILDINGS IN FACT THERE ARE THE

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:27.753
PREDOMINANT SUPPLY THAT'S OUT

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.588
THERE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.323
THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED- LIKE

02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:32.925
SHADE TREES AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:34.760
CHARGING THAT ARE SITE SPECIFIC

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:36.362
AND THEY'RE TRIGGERED WHEN AN

02:05:36.428 --> 02:05:38.063
ACTION IS TAKEN EITHER YOU KNOW

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.798
ON A PARKING AREA OR NEW PARKING

02:05:39.865 --> 02:05:42.668
AREA- OR ANY SITE IMPROVEMENT OR

02:05:42.735 --> 02:05:44.236
REHABILITATION OF LANDSCAPES AND

02:05:44.303 --> 02:05:46.372
SO WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:05:46.438 --> 02:05:47.306
PROJECTS A LITTLE MORE

02:05:47.373 --> 02:05:49.942
CAREFULLY. AND ENSURE THAT WHEN

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:51.543

02:05:51.610 --> 02:05:52.845
SUSTAINABILITY FEATURES

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:54.480
INSTALLED THAT WERE ACTUALLY

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:56.115
CHECKING TO ENSURE THAT THAT

02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:59.685
HAPPENS AND SO IT IS. A PROCESS

02:05:59.752 --> 02:06:01.687
THAT WE TAKE IN OUR INTAKE IF

02:06:01.754 --> 02:06:04.256
IT'S NOT INCLUDED AT INTAKE WE

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:06.058

PROVIDE THAT DOCUMENTATION PRIOR

02:06:17.036 --> 02:06:18.971
TO THE FINAL REVIEW SO OUR GOAL

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:21.440
IS NOT TO NECESSARILY DELAY THE

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:23.342
SUSTAINABILITY REVIEW NOR IS IT

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.777
TO DELAY THE PROJECT IT'S TO

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.278

02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:37.582
THAT MODERNIZATION ARRIVES AT

02:12:37.649 --> 02:12:40.385
50% OF ITS VALUE OF THE BUILDING

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:44.956
VALUE- THEN IT TRIGGERS A FULL.

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:45.824
UPGRADE FOR THE STRUCTURAL

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:48.727
SAFETY ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT.

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:50.962
AND SO FOR A LOT OF THESE

02:12:51.029 --> 02:12:53.332
HISTORICAL BUILDINGS- IT'S NOT

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:54.399
YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS ON THE

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:55.967
BUILDING BUT THIS COULD BE A

02:12:56.034 --> 02:12:57.235
VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:58.837
THAT WAS A PLAN FOR BY OUR

02:12:58.904 --> 02:13:01.840
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND SO WHERE

02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:04.109
WE USED TO SEE THIS HAPPEN-

02:13:04.176 --> 02:13:06.178
PERHAPS MAYBE ONCE A YEAR WE ARE

02:13:06.244 --> 02:13:08.213
NOW SEEING APPROXIMATELY TEN

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:10.449
PROJECTS A MONTH WHERE THIS IS

02:13:10.515 --> 02:13:12.951
OCCURRING. IN VARIOUS AREAS OF

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:16.254
THE STATE AND SO. WHAT THAT

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:18.757
TENDS TO DO OBVIOUSLY DERAIL

02:13:18.824 --> 02:13:19.958
YEARS OF PLANNING THAT THE

02:13:20.025 --> 02:13:21.426
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE PERFORMED

02:13:21.493 --> 02:13:22.994
AND A LOT OF THIS REASON IS

02:13:23.061 --> 02:13:24.730
BECAUSE THE- COST OF

02:13:24.796 --> 02:13:26.365
CONSTRUCTION FLUCTUATE SO

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:28.066
GREATLY AND SO IF THEY'RE

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:30.035
PLANNING VERY CLOSE TO THAT 50%

02:13:30.102 --> 02:13:31.570
MARK. THEN THE COST OF

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:32.704
CONSTRUCTION WHEN THEY'RE

02:13:32.771 --> 02:13:34.172
PROVIDING THAT COST ESTIMATE

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:36.341
COULD REALLY SEND IT OVER THE

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:36.942
MARK AND THEN CREATE ALL THIS

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:40.612
ADDITIONAL WORK. YEAH SO- WE

02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:44.216
DIDN'T WANT TO- WE NEED TO WE

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:45.550
REALIZE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:46.885
REGULATION THAT'S BEEN ON THE

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:48.787
BOOKS FOR A WHILE AND SEE HOW WE

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.989
CAN EITHER ADJUSTED FOR

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:53.725
IMPROVEMENT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE.

02:13:53.792 --> 02:13:55.127
THE STRUCTURAL SAFETY WE NEED

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:57.963
BUT ALSO ADDRESS RESILIENCY AND

02:13:58.029 --> 02:13:58.997
SUSTAINABILITY IT'S VERY

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:01.500
DIFFICULT FOR DSA TO SAY THAT

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:02.367
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE

02:14:02.434 --> 02:14:04.035
SUSTAINABLE ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO

02:14:04.102 --> 02:14:05.437
BE SUSTAINABLE AND THEN WE HAVE

02:14:05.504 --> 02:14:06.805
A REGULATION THAT MAY ENCOURAGE

02:14:06.872 --> 02:14:08.106
SCHOOLS TO ACTUALLY DEMOLISHED

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:10.609
BUILDING IN ORDER TO PROCEED.

02:14:10.675 --> 02:14:11.343
BECAUSE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.145
BUILD A NEW ONE- OBVIOUSLY

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:15.547
THAT'S NOT VERY- IT DOESN'T BODE

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:17.449
WELL FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S A

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:19.885
VERY CARBON INTENSIVE. YEAH SO

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:22.154
WE HAVE ARRANGED A TASK FORCE

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:24.322
THAT ACTUALLY OUR FIRST MEETING

02:14:24.389 --> 02:14:26.258
WILL BE MARCH NIGHT- WE'VE

02:14:26.324 --> 02:14:27.526
ENGAGED WITH THE SCHOOL

02:14:27.592 --> 02:14:29.761
DISTRICTS WITH ARCHITECTS WITH-

02:14:29.828 --> 02:14:31.730
STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS AND OTHER

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:32.864
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS AS

02:14:32.931 --> 02:14:34.833
WELL. AND WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.301
AND TRYING TO EXPLORE AND

02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:38.537
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE PROCESS CAN

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:40.806
WE HAVE HE TRIGGER POINTS THAT

02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:48.280
MAYBE WE DO. THAT THAT THE

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:50.816
PROJECTS NOT SO VOLATILE

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:52.284
DEPENDING ON THE CONSTRUCTION

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:55.220
COSTS RIGHT OR- JUST YOU KNOW

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:57.289
THE REGULATION ITSELF THAT SAYS

02:14:57.355 --> 02:14:59.357
LET'S PRIORITIZE SAFETY BUT IT'S

02:14:59.424 --> 02:15:01.092
LOST A LOOK AT SUSTAINABILITY

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:02.828
RESILIENCY AND HOW CAN WE WRITER

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:04.696
REGULATIONS SO THAT. OUR SCHOOLS

02:15:04.763 --> 02:15:06.865
CAN BETTER PLAN BUT THAT WE CAN

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:08.166
ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS ARE

02:15:08.233 --> 02:15:09.935
SAFE WHEN THESE FACILITIES ARE

02:15:10.001 --> 02:15:12.704
MODERNIZE. SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:14.306
OF THIS PROCESS WE USE TASK

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:16.708
FORCES BEFORE- I'VE IMPLEMENTED

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:18.710
TWO OR THREE OF MY TIME AT TSA.

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:19.611
THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.613
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.381
AN EXPLORATION OF THE PROJECT

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:24.449
TOGETHER AND THE PROBLEM

02:15:24.516 --> 02:15:26.618
TOGETHER AND LISTENING TO EACH

02:15:26.685 --> 02:15:28.587
OTHER AND UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:30.255
WHERE WE WHERE WE ALL NEED TO

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:31.490
WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:33.492
WERE MEETING THAT GOAL WHICH IS

02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:34.860
TO TRY TO SAVE SOME OF OUR

02:15:34.926 --> 02:15:36.828
EXISTING FACILITIES. TRY TO MAKE

02:15:36.895 --> 02:15:39.130
THEM STRUCTURALLY SAFER TRY TO

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.465
MAKE THEM MORE SUSTAINABLE AND

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:43.768
TRY TO DELIVER THESE PROJECTS ON

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:44.369
TIME FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

02:15:44.436 --> 02:15:45.604
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T NEED

02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:46.638

BECAUSE IT WAS- HAVE YOU ENGAGED

02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.642
IN A PROCESS TO ADDRESS THIS

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.244
REGULATORY PROBLEM THAT SEEMS TO

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.912
BE. PROHIBITING SCHOOLS FROM

02:15:53.979 --> 02:15:55.881
BEING ABLE TO DO A MODERNIZATION

02:15:55.947 --> 02:15:57.516
WITHOUT TEARING DOWN COMPLETE

02:15:57.582 --> 02:15:59.584
BUILDINGS. AND YOU HAVE AND YOU

02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:01.419

MAYBE YOU TO ADDRESS THIS

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:21.706
EARLIER AND JUST- AS IT RELATES

02:16:21.773 --> 02:16:23.041
TO THE CAL GREENE RULEMAKING

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:26.378
PROCESS THESE- HAVE YOU CONVEYED

02:16:26.444 --> 02:16:28.780
YOUR FRUSTRATION AT THE SLOW

02:16:28.847 --> 02:16:32.284
NESS OF IT. WELL THE PROCESS

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.819
ITSELF IS STEPS THAT STATUTE AND

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:37.756
I THINK IT'S NOT THAT IT'S- A

02:16:37.822 --> 02:16:39.824
SLOW PROCESS SO MUCH IS THAT THE

02:16:39.891 --> 02:16:43.328
LENGTH OF THE ROCESS- TENDS TO.

02:16:43.395 --> 02:16:45.897
FLUCTUATE THE ENGAGEMENT- BUT

02:16:45.964 --> 02:16:47.232
THE PROCESS IS NECESSARY IN

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:48.667
ORDER FOR US TO DO OUR OUTREACH

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:50.201
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:51.870
TO IMPROVE REGULATIONS ON AN

02:16:51.937 --> 02:16:54.172
EIGHTEEN MONTH CYCLE. AND SIX

02:16:54.239 --> 02:16:56.341
MONTHS OF THAT TIME IS REALLY

02:16:56.408 --> 02:16:58.343
WORKING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:16:58.410 --> 02:16:59.411
WHETHER WHICH WOULD BE THE

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:00.779
PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

02:17:00.845 --> 02:17:02.647
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:04.149
ENGAGING WITH THEM AND LETTING

02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:05.250
THEM KNOW WHAT THE PROPOSED

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:07.819
REGULATIONS ARE WHY WE'RE DOING

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:09.754
IT WE ALSO HAVE TO DO COST

02:17:09.821 --> 02:17:10.689
ANALYSES SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:17:10.755 --> 02:17:12.524
WORK THAT GOES INTO DEVELOPMENT

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:13.758
OF THE REGULATIONS BUT THERE'S

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:15.460
ALSO A LOT OF PACKAGE PUBLIC

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:16.161
ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:19.130
INVOLVEMENT. AND IT ONCE IT ONCE

02:17:19.197 --> 02:17:20.832
WE DO OUR INITIAL PRE CYCLE OUT

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:23.368
REACH- AND WE ESTABLISH WHAT THE

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.103
REGULATIONS ARE AND THEN THERE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.404
IS A WHOLE NOTHER FORMAL PROCESS

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:27.372
THAT GOES THROUGH BUILDING

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:29.040
STANDARDS AND THERE'S OTHER

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:31.610
CHECKPOINTS TO ENGAGE. AND IT'S

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:33.144
TRYING TO DRAW THEM BACK INTO

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:34.512
THOSE CHECKPOINTS TO ENGAGE

02:17:34.579 --> 02:17:36.147
BECAUSE AS WE RECEIVE COMMENTS

02:17:36.214 --> 02:17:38.416
WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:41.186
THE REGULATION- SOMEWHAT. AND SO

02:17:41.252 --> 02:17:43.388
IT'S REALLY TRYING TO REACH OUT

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:44.489
TO THE SCHOOLS AND SAY HERE'S

02:17:44.556 --> 02:17:45.824
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO

FORM AND IT'S- DEPENDING ON

02:17:52.964 --> 02:17:54.132
BECAUSE IT'S EVERY EIGHTEEN

02:17:54.199 --> 02:17:55.533
MONTHS DEPENDING ON HOW BUSY ARE

02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.135
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ESPECIALLY

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.603
RECENTLY WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:00.605
ALSO AT THE START OF SCHOOL OR

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:01.973
YOU KNOW IF IT'S IN THE MIDDLE

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.141
OF SUMMER AND THAT'S WHEN THAT

02:18:03.208 --> 02:18:05.076
TIME FALLS AND THEY'RE VERY BUSY

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:05.644
WITH CONSTRUCTION ON THEIR

02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:07.579
CAMPUSES. SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER

02:18:07.646 --> 02:18:13.952
TO GET THEIR ATTENTION SO WHILE. THE PROCESS IS- YOU KNOW

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:15.687
SECONDS. PRETTY MUCH A STATUTE

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:17.188
AND THERE'S A REALLY GOOD REASON

02:18:17.255 --> 02:18:19.858
FOR IT IT'S REALLY US TRYING TO.

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:21.426

SORT OF ENERGIZED OUR PROCESS

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:39.511
EASIER SORT OF ACTIVATE THEM IN

02:18:39.577 --> 02:18:42.747
A WAY THAT- KEEP THINGS CURRENT

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:45.583
BECAUSE- DISTRICTS ARE. TRYING

02:18:45.650 --> 02:18:47.052
TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THEIR

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:48.720
FACULTY AND THEIR STUDENTS AND

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.121
THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE TRYING TO

02:18:50.188 --> 02:18:52.123
BUILD. IN A WAY THAT IS-

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:54.259
SUITABLE FOR THE KIND OF-

02:18:54.325 --> 02:18:55.527
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING ON

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:57.395
