AND A MEMBER ONE TWO YES YOU IF YOU WISH WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE UP. YOUR SECOND ITEM ON THE AGENDA THAT IS ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB. TWENTY THREE YOU COULD BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU THINK FOR IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ON WE ARE WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT US AND SOMETHING THAT I WORKED ON OVER THE YEARS HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY I'M HERE. TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE WHICH ESTABLISHED PLACE A DEPUTY OF BUSINESS AND WORKFORCE. COR NATION UNDER THE OFFICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATES THINK OF IS CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE CONTINUED PROSPERITY OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY ACCOUNTING FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND OR EIGHTY THREE POINT 3%. OF THE NET NEW JOBS CREATED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UNFORTUNATELY THE SUCCESSES THREATENED BY A POTENTIAL SHORTENS SHORTAGE ONE TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION QUALIFIED WORKERS BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE WHICH IF REALIZE WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DISINCENTIVES FOR NEW BUSINESSES TO COMING UP ABOUT CALIFORNIA. AND FOR EXISTING BUSINESSES TO REMAIN IN THE STATE. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH A DEPUTY OF BUSINESS AND WORKFORCE COORDINATION WITHIN THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. TO OUT REACH AND ENGAGE SMALL BUSINESS ON THEIR LABOR NEEDS TO BETTER ALIGN CALIFORNIANS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WITH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LABOR MARKET. ESTABLISHING A SPECIFIC ENTITY TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE SMALL BUSINESS AND ADDRESS THEIR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS WOULD HELP THESE BUSINESSES REMAIN COMPETITIVE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE OFTEN LIMITED NATURE OF THEIR RESOURCES. TO LOOK BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THEIR SPECIFIC BUSINESS PRACTICE FOR THE MORE ENSURING THE STATE'S WORKFORCE PROGRAM ALIGNS WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PROVIDES FOR WIDER EXPANSION OF PROSPERITY AS INDIVIDUALS WILL BE PREPARED FOR THE OPENINGS AVAILABLE WHEN THEY COMPETE WHEN THEY COMPLETE THEIR TRAINING WITH ME TO TESTIFY A SPONSOR THE BILL. OUR AND NICKEL RICE'S CMT AND ERIC FOR AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION. THE MORNING MA'AM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THE CALL RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND ALONG WITH THE CALVARY WORK FOR SAYS HE SHOULD BE OUR SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- MANY TIMES I'VE PER PER -- ADDED TO THIS COMMITTEE -- EVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR SKILLED WORKFORCE IN MANUFACTURING AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR OUR SMALL MANUFACTURERS WHO OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE MANPOWER. NECESSARY TO NAVIGATE THE UNFAMILIAR AND COMPLEX. EDUCATIONAL WORKFORCE TRAINING SYSTEMS -- AND THEY DESPERATELY NEED THESE INDIVIDUALS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THEIR PRODUCTION AND SEES INNOVATION TO INCREASE THEIR COMPETITIVENESS AND A DYNAMIC GLOBAL MARKET PLACE. IN OUR LETTER WE DISCUSSED HOW IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR SMALL MANUFACTURERS TO MISS OUT ON NEW OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT ONE ADDITIONAL PERSON. TO YOU EITHER OPERATE THAT INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY OR TO MANAGE THAT EXTRA SHIFT -- SO THE FOCUS ON SMALL MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESS -- IN THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT. A COUPLE OF THINGS I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS BILL IS UTILIZING. AN EXISTING SYSTEM WITHIN THE STATE GOVERNMENT -- AND INTO TV THAT IS NOT ONLY KNOWN BY SMALL BUSINESSES TO AS A RESOURCE -- FOR INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE IN THE STATE SYSTEM BUT ALSO. IS KNOWN THE BUSINESSES ARE KNOWN BY THIS ENTITY AND HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS THAT. THE LEASE OWNS IN THOSE SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY BRIDGING FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BETWEEN THE EDUCATION OR TRAINING SYSTEMS WHERE THIS LIAISON. IS GOING TO BE BRIDGING BETWEEN MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND OFTENTIMES THOSE OTHER LIAISONS IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SMALL BUSINESSES. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND US ANY MORE THAN WE KNOW HOW TO FIND THEM SO AGAIN AS THE AUTHOR SAID THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE IT WILL HELP CREATE PROSPERITY AND BE -- AN OUTLOOK IT IF YOU WILL SOLUTION TO A DRESSING WHAT IS NOW THE MISSING LINK WHICH IS HELPING BUSINESSES CONNECT WITH THOSE PROGRAMS. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE SUPPORTIVE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU.

TO ALIGN THE SYSTEMS WITH A THREE POINT NINE MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. THEY IN PLAY OVER 50% OF OUR STATES WORKFORCE. THIS IS WHY I SEE TO BE A IS PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB. TWENTY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD WORK WITH AN ODD MAN EXISTING PROGRAMS AND COORDINATE ACROSS CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. THE BILL'S PROPOSED DEPUTY OF BUSINESS AND WORK FORCE COORDINATION WOULD BE A WELCOME PARTNER.

THE BEAUTY OF THIS PROGRAM IS IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE AND PIGGY BACK OFF OF THE FEDERAL WHAT'S THE BECAUSE OUR E. D. D. R. EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE.
