THANK YOU FOR YOUR COP COOPERATION. AND I KNOW WE WON'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE INSTANCES HERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE A VERY FRIENDLY COMMAND COMMITTEE- WELL FIRST THIS IS EXCITING TO SHARE MY FIRST COMMUNICATION AND CONVENIENCE COMMITTEES HEARING AND- I'M NOT ONLY EXCITED BUT- HAPPY TO SEE MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE- WE'VE INVITED SEVERAL. MEMBERS OF THE SPEAKERS BROADBAND WORKING GROUP TO PARTICIPATE GIVEN THEIR REGULAR INVOLVEMENT ON THIS TOPIC. AS SOME OF YOU MAY OR MAY NOT NOTE THIS BROADBAND WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN MEETING FOR WELL OVER A YEAR. ON THAT NOTE I'D LKE TO GET IN THANK SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON FOR APPOINTMENT APPOINTING ME TO LEAD THIS IMPORTANT COMMITTEE. ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME WHEN THE ISSUES ARE FOCUSED. ON OUR SO TIMELY. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT FOCUS ON CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ENSURING DIGITAL EQUITY BOTH FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE NEW CEMENT MINISTRATION. I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS OVERALL FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES. AND MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. FORTUNATELY THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS AND THE VITAMINS ADMINISTRATIONS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL SUPPORT TO HELP OUR STATE RECOVER AND BUILD BACK BETTER FROM THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE VIRUS BECOMES AN ENDEMIC WE MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO SOLVING THE ISSUES. THAT AFFECT OUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS IN. ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE RURAL AND URBAN STILL LACK ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE RELIABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. AND I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT BECAUSE SOME OF US MAY FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT ARE BETTER CONNECTED THAN OTHERS AND THAT IS TRUE BUT WE STILL FIND. NEIGHBORHOODS AND AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO CONNECTION AND YEAH EVEN IN A VERY CONNECTED AREA- THIS IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NEW SAMYN MINISTRATION MADE A HISTORIC SIX BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. THROUGH SENATE BILL ONE FIVE SIX A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MONEY WAS FEDERAL FOREIGN FUNDING WITH STRICT TIMELINES AND GUIDELINES AND HOW IT IS SPENT AS THE MINISTRATION MOVES AHEAD TO IMPLEMENT ALL PROGRAMS FUNDED IN THAT LEGISLATION I AM COMMITTED TO HAVING THIS COMMITTEE PLAY. A STRONG OVERSIGHT ROLE UNDERSCORING OVERSIGHT ROLE TODAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE IN THE FUTURE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE PLAN WILL FOCUS ON THE LAST MILE PROGRAM SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND. BECAUSE THE TWO APPROACHES WE NEED BOTH OF THOSE TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THEY MUST GO HAND IN HAND. WE CANNOT HAVE A EFFECTIVE LAST MILE SOLUTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLDS THAT NEED IT UNLESS THERE IS A OPERATIONAL MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE IS THE STATE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA NOW OPEN IT UP FOR REMARKS- FROM OUR VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE WITH YOU AND WELCOME. MEMBERS I HAVE BEEN SERVING ON THE UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE AT ALSO HERE AT CMC. AND WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT CLOSING THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR AT LEAST NINE OR TEN YEARS. WE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY NOW IN THE PIPELINE. AND SO I WANT US TO RECOGNIZE SOMETHING THAT. THIS IS ACHIEVABLE. WE CAN CLOSE THIS GAP. IT IS A FINITE. OBLA WE THINK THERE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE ON SERVED. THAT IS AN ACHIEVABLE GOAL PARTICULARLY WITH THE FUNDING WE HAVE. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THE PROVIDERS ARE READY THEY'RE WILLING THEY'RE ABLE THEY'RE AT THE TABLE. AND THEY REALLY WANT TO BE A PARTNER IN THIS AND YET I THINK SOME GET CONCERNED THAT THE BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS. ARE BASICALLY MAYBE SAYING NO WAIT MAY BE PUSHING IT OFF FOR A PERIOD O TIME. I WANT TO RAISE THE CONCERN THAT THE P. YOU SEE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. THEY NEED TO BE BUREAUCRACIES THAT. SMOOTHED OUT THIS PROCESS GET THE DETERMINATIONS DONE AND GET THE THAT THE MONEY INTO THE TO BE. AND WE NEED TO REMIND OURSELVES S. B. ONE FIVE SIX WAS VERY CLEAR SURE THE UNSERVED. AND I THINK IF WE MISS THAT OPPORTUNITY IF WE'RE BOGGED DOWN IN SOME OF THIS BUREAUCRATIC DECISION MAKING. AND OF THE P. YOU SEE TAKES UPON ITSELF SOME. OF THE DESIRE TO HEAD IN A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN WHAT SB ONE FIVE SIX WAS VERY CLEAR. WE MAY ENTER INTO A TIME WHERE WE WASTE A LOT OF MONEY. WE CAN'T DRAW DOWN ALL THE FEDERAL MONEY OUT BECAUSE OF IT AND I THINK WE GOT TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW THESE BUREAUCRACIES GET US TO THE FINISH LINE. THEY NEED TO BE STREAMLINED THEY NEED TO BE EFFICIENT THEY NEED TO GET US TO THE PLACE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS CONSTRUCTING DOING IT- WITH THE VERY LATEST TECHNOLOGY. I HOPE THAT AT THE END OF ALL OF THIS. AND I HOPE IT'S SOON. WE WILL SEE THOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY. WE'VE DONE IT SO LET'S DO IT AND LET'S NOT LET BARACK CHRISSY'S GET IN THE WAY. AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE I APPLAUD THE CHAIR. FOR HER WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THE OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THIS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WERE HERE. AND SO WILL COME BACK. SEVERAL MORE TIMES. AND WE WILL CHECK ON THE PROGRESS AND I'M HOPING. THAT WE'VE MADE THE PROGRESS CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO MAKE. AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY SEE THAT PROGRESS TAKE PLACE. THIS IS A GOLDEN MOMENT AND CALIFORNIA IS STANDING AT A CROSSROADS. LET'S DO IT NOT NOT NO NOT WAIT NOT MAYBE LET'S DO IT. NOW GET IT DONE WE HAVE THE MONEY WE HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. MY CONCERN IS WHEN THEY RUN OUT OF TIME. BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT MONEY HAS TO BE SPENT. SO LET'S RUN OUR SLEEVES UP. THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED BOTH FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. LET'S AGREE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE TIME WE END THE DIGITAL FIVE. THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA OPEN IT UP TO ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY INTRODUCTION COMMENTS. SOMEONE MEMBER RAYOS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE AND- I APPLAUD THE SPEAKER FOR. APPOINTING YOU TO THIS POSITION YOU HAVE BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT. OF INTERNET TROLL AND TO MAKING SURE THAT EQUITY IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT- AFFECT OUR COMMUNITY. HAVING ACCESS TO RELIABLE AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS A NECESSITY IN TODAY'S LIFE IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE THINK SOME PEOPLE DESERVE AND OTHERS DON'T OR SOME PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE AND OTHERS DON'T NEED IT. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE STUDENTS YEAH DURING COVERT THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD GET THEIR LESSONS- BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN IT WOULD IN MEDICINE THOSE ARE THE APPOINTMENTS IT'S BEING ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR- YOUR YOUR DOCTOR WOULD DIFFER JOB APPLICATIONS. FOR TELEWORK IT AND SO MANY THINGS IT IS NOT A LUXURY IT IS ABSOLUTELY. A REQUIREMENT FOR MODERN LIFE. THE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE FINALLY GET THE MONEY. NOW WE'VE GOT TO DO THE HARD WORK AND HAVING THIS OVERSIGHT- HEARING IS THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP- I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT AYE AYE I AM VERY PROUD AS YOU'VE SAID. I'M VERY PROUD OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR INVESTING SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING AND I THINK THAT THIS COULD DO EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE SET OUT TO DO AND THAT IS TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THERE ARE THE THREE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS ALWAYS LOOK AT IT THAT IS ACCESSIBILITY. RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. IT ACCESSIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE THE MIDDLE MILE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ACCOMPLISH WE THEN HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESSIBILITY. IF THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS NOT RELIABLE OR IF IT IS NOT AFFORDABLE IT'S AS IF THEY HAD NO INTERNET CONNECTION. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING OUT TO IN THE FUTURE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO. TO THIS OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HEARING AND I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS AS WELL TO ITS VERY. REAFFIRMING TO HEAR THAT A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE BUT ALSO THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR TO EACH OTHER AND I KNOW THE CHAIR AND I HAVE YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY BUT THAT IT'S OUR OBLIGATION A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GETTING IN SERVING THE CONSTITUENCIES. THAT NEEDED THE MOST AS WELL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROOM PERHAPS MAYBE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHEN APPROPRIATE TO ALSO LEARN ABOUT THESE AS WELL SO I REAFFIRM MY COMMITMENT TO HELPING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING OUR JOB ON THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL TOO. BUT I ALSO ASKED ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET RID OF THE RED TAPE BECAUSE THIS IS A FRUSTRATING PROCESS IN THE OF COURSE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. BUT THAT ALSO REQUIRES US TO DO OUR JOB AND OVERSIGHT WHILE MIGHT BE UNCOMFORTABLE AS WELL SO LET'S HAVE THESE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND PUT THE EFFORT IN ACCORDINGLY AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH VENTURE. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER JIM WOOD WHO ALSO SITS ON THE MIDDLE MILE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS WELL AS I DO. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY- WE YOU AND I HAVE BEEN LIVING THIS- FOR AWHILE NOW. AND AND- THEY'LL BE ANXIOUS TO HEAR THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY- IT IS- IT IS A MONUMENTAL TASK- THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US- WE'RE ASKING- TOO. LARGE AGENCIES THAT DON'T TYPICALLY WORK TOGETHER. TO WORK TOGETHER ACTUALLY FORCING THEM TO WORK TOGETHER- AND THAT ISN'T WITHOUT CHALLENGES QUITE FRANKLY- AND- AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO. PRESS IS- HOW WE MEET OUR DEADLINES- THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO US. IS TO GET TO THE END OF THE ROAD. AND NOT HAVE. COMMITTED THE RESOURCES AND HALF A HALF OF LOSE IT AND THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE MONUMENTAL FAILURE AND WE JUST CAN'T LT THAT HAPPEN. SO THANK YOU. EXACTLY ANYBODY ELSE ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL- WHICH IS TITLED SB ONE FIFTY SIX AND THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE WE WILL BE. A WELCOME MEAN- BRIAN METZGER WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL FISCAL AND POLICY AND- ANALISIS FOR PRIVACY. SECURITY TECHNOLOGY ASSIGNMENT. FOR THE L. A. O. OR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS. OFFICE WELCOME BRIAN. GOOD MORNING SHARON MEMBERS BRIAN METZGER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE. OPERATION FOR THE HEARING OUR OFFICE PREPARE TO HAND OUT THAT WE WILL SHARE ON SCREEN SO GIVE ME ONE MOMENT. GREAT MEMBERS AND STAFF SHOULD ALSO HAVE PRINTED COPIES OF THE HANDOUT AVAILABLE TO THEM HAND OUT WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE TOPICS WE WERE ASKED TO COVER FOR THIS HEARING. THESE TOPICS INCLUDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS. SOME GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX WHICH LARGELY IMPLEMENTS THE AGREEMENT INCLUSIVE OF A STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. ON THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT CAGE TOO WE PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE SIX BILLION DOLLAR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT. ABOUT FOUR POINT THREE BILLION OF THE SIX BILLION TOTAL IS FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN OR A. R. P. FISCAL RELIEF FUNDS. WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IT ARPITA RELIEF FUNDS ARE SUBJECT TO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS THE ANNUAL RECOVERY PLAN PERFORMANCE REPORTS AND QUARTERLY PROJECT AN EXPENDITURE REPORTS. AIR PETE FUNDS MUST BE ENCUMBERED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND EXPENDED BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THIS SPENDING PLAN SHOWS HOW THIS FUNDING IS ALLOCATED AMONG THE THREE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OR PROGRAMS INCLUDING MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THAT IS THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. THE ENTIRE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL A. R. P. FUNDS FOR THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY OR CD T. IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. ON PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT WE PROVIDE DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH OF THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS AND IDENTIFY S. B. ONE FIFTY SIX AGAIN AS THE PRIMARY IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION FOR THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AGREEMENT. ON THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE FOR WE DESCRIBE IN BROAD GROUPS THE TYPES OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE RELEVANT TO TODAY'S HEARING INFRASTRUCTURE IS OFTEN HIGH CAPACITY FIBER OPTIC CABLES LAID OVER TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILES AT A TIME THAT ONCE CONNECTED TO BUY AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER OR ISP CAN'T DELIVER LOCAL HIGH SPEED INTERNET. SO TO ACHIEVE INCREASED ACCESS TO BROADBAND SERVICES BY COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS MIDDLE MILE NETWORKS OFTEN HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ISPS TO CONNECT TO. ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HAND OUT WE PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE NUMBER OF ESTIMATED ROAD MILES TO BE COVERED BY THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK IS EXPECTED TO BE DEPLOYED LARGELY ALONG THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS AND OTHER RIGHTS OF WAY. ULTIMATELY THE FINAL MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED AND CONSTRUCTED WILL DETERMINE THE FINAL NUMBER OF ROAD MILES BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR PURPOSES OF BACKGROUND TO HAVE THIS NUMBER. WE ALSO DESCRIBE THE INITIAL EIGHTEEN PROJECTS SELECTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH TOTAL BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED MILES. WITH PROJECTS IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF THE STATE RANGING FROM LESS THAN TEN MILES TO ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES IN LENGTH. THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT FOR THIS HEARING PROVIDES A LIST OF THESE PROJECTS FOR YOUR REVIEW. WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF A STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS DESCRIBED BY THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICE TO UNSERVED INDOOR UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. LOWER CONSUMER PRICES FOR THIS SERVICE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS WITH BETTER ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT H. SIX SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE KEY MIDDLE MILE RELATED PROVISIONS OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX. FOR EXAMPLE SB ONE FIFTY SIX CODIFIES THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF STATE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. AND THE NEXT PANEL ON THE AGENDA WILL INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM A NUMBER OF THESE ENTITIES. IN ADDITION THE LAW REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR TO MANAGE THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- CPUC TO CONSIDER SOME CRITERIA WHEN IDENTIFYING PRIORITIZING NETWORK LOCATIONS. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CALTRANS AND OTHERS BUILDING THE NETWORK TO USE CERTAIN PROCESS SEES AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS TO EXPEDITE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK. PAGE SEVEN OF THE HANDOUT LISTS THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN MIDDLE MILE NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION. CITY'S OFFICE OF BROADBAND AND DIGITAL LITERACY OBI B. D. L. OVERSEES THE ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACTS TO DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT THE NETWORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP THE POLICIESPRACTICES RULES AND STANDARDS FOR OPERATION AND USE OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK ONCE CONSTRUCTED. CPUC HELPS TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK LOCATIONS AND THEN PROVIDES THOSE TO RELEVANT PARTIES. TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE THESE LOCATIONS SI PC HOW TO SOLICIT AND RECEIVE COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. CALTRANS WILL BE A KEY ENTITY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK AS WELL. IT IS OUR AGREEMENT BETWEEN CALTRANS AND CD T. TO CONSTRUCT THESE PROJECTS IS ALREADY IN PLACE. IN OTHER ENTITIES ON THIS LIST INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TWO OF THE AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE DEPARTMENTS RESPONSIBLE FROM IN A MILE NETWORK ACTIVITIES. THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT PAGE EIGHT TALKS ABOUT THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE CTV'S- B. B. T. L. ANNOUNCED TO THE CORPORATION FOR EDUCATION NETWORK INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA'S SCENIC. AND ITS MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE WOULD BE THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. NOW REFER TO AS THE GOLDEN STATE NATS THIS THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR INCLUDES A NUMBER ADVICE OF ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS EXECUTIVE STAFF AND OTHER SCENIC STAFF WITH EXPERTISE IN BROADBAND INTERNET RELATED ISSUES. AGAIN THE ROLE OF THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IN THIS PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT GOLDEN STATE IN THAT WILL MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WITH OVERSIGHT FROM CTV'S- BBDO. H. NINE OF THE HANDOUT TALKS ABOUT THE BROADBAND ADVISORY COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED IN STATUTE TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND GUIDANCE TO ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. THIS COMMITTEE IS NOW KNOWN AS THE MIDDLE MILE ADVISORY COMMITTEE OR MMA SCENE AND CONSISTS OF FIVE MEMBERS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND FOR FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WE PROVIDE THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE MACD ALTHOUGH AS YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE MEMBERS HAVE RECENTLY CHANGED POSITIONS AND WE WERE UNABLE TO UPDATE THE HANDOUT- IN TIME FOR THIS HEARING APOLOGIES FOR THAT. THE NEXT PAGE OF THE HANDOUT SIMPLY REFLECTS THE STATUTORY OBLIGATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO HOLD MONTHLY IN MMA C. MEETINGS. THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION AND QUARTERLY THEREAFTER. AND FINALLY PAGE ELEVEN DESCRIBES THE ANNUAL LEGISLATIVE REPORT ALSO REQUIRED BY S. B. ONE FIFTY SIX TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROGRESS ON THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDES THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THE LENGTH CONSTRUCTED OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER. THE NUMBER OF ISPS AND HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED TO AND USING THE NETWORK EXPENDITURE DATA AS WELL AS PROJECTED GOALS FOR EACH OF THESE MEASURES OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE FIRST REPORT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU EXCELLENT- HANDOUT THAT WE HAVE HERE- QUITE ROBUST AND I THINK- IT. DEFINITELY ON YOUR PAGE ELEVEN LETS USKNOW SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WE ASKED INITIALLY ABOUT PROGRESS REPORTS AND SO FAR- WITH THAT I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO OUR MEMBERS HERE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS VERY MUCH- MANAGER OF HOPING THAT YOU MIGHT BILL TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS AS I WAS TAKING A LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING PRESENTED TELL ME YOU HAVE A GRASP AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT EIGHTEEN PILOT LOCATIONS OF THE CRITERIA THAT WERE USED A SPECIFICALLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- THAT APPEARS THAT- THERE ARE NUMBER. OF URBAN AREAS- THAT BEEN SELECTED AND IN WHICH CASE THAT WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT THAT. YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO PRIORITIZE UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL TOO BUT YOU HELP GIVE SOME INSIGHT ON WHAT THAT. ON ON ON THE INSIDE OF SOME BACKGROUND ON THE CRITERIA. SURE I CAN PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION AND I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING TO THESE PROJECTS- IN THE NEXT PANEL- BUT IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CRITERIA THAT WERE USED. TO DETERMINE THESE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS WERE BOTH THE STATUTORY CRITERIA FROM S. B. ONE FIFTY SIX. ABOUT THE AREAS THAT. DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK CONNECTIONS- AND ALSO- THAT WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS- BUT THERE WERE OTHER CNSIDERATIONS AS WELL INCLUDING- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE STATE WOULD OPERATIONALIZE THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. INCLUDING CONSTRUCTING NEW MIDDLE MILE NETWORK- CABLES ACTUALLY LEASING EXISTING FIBER- AND ALSO LOOKING AT INCORPORATING- MIDDLE MILE NETWORK CONSTRUCTION INTO EXISTING CALTRANS PROJECTS- ESSENTIALLY MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THESE PROJECTS WERE INTENDED TO SERVICE PILOTS. TO DEMONSTRATE THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE STATE THE STATE COULD ACHIEVE- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK ACROSS OF A RANGE OF DIFFERENT- OPTIONS QUESTIONS I'M SORRY IF I DIDN'T AND JUST AWFUL OF HIM I MIGHT PLEASE- AND JUST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE HATS THE LAWN AND THE AND THE COMICS THAT WE SHARED ON THE OVERSIGHT AND THE IMPORTANCE ALSO THAT MANY OF US WILL BE ACTUALLY GONE BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU OUTLINED SOME OF THAT TOO AND YOU MIGHT YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON THE APPROACH THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE TO HELP ENSURE. THE APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION ACCORDINGLY WHILE WE ARE STILL HERE. THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION AND SOMETHING WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN MONITORING. IS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN ENCUMBERED. AND EXPENDED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS FOR LAST MILE PROJECTS I'M SORRY NOT LET'S NOT PROJECTS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK PROJECTS- THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING PROVIDED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION AS IT SUBMITS QUARTERLY REPORTS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- AND SO WE ARE MONITORING THOSE- ENCUMBRANCES AND EXPENDITURES. TO KIND OF TRACK AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE MEETING EXPECTED TIMELINES. ON THEIR OTHER CAMINO METRICS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE LOOKED AT SOME OF THEM- ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE LEGISLATIVE REPORTS SUCH AS THE- LENGTH OF THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THE AMOUNT CONSTRUCTED OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER- BUT I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY- SOME VALUE IN LOOKING AT THOSE EXPENDITURES AND CONFERENCE NUMBERS. GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. HOW I JUST UP THE OBSERVATION ARE PERSONALIZED APPRECIATE- THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED WITH RESPECT TO THOSE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS AND HOW THEY WERE AT. FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT AREA HAS THE- NEEDS IN THOSE IN THOSE AREAS- THE THERE IS SOME CONCERN I THINK FROM THOSE THAT I REPRESENT THAT. THERE IS A HEAVY RESPECT TO SOME OF THE AREAS- I RAISE IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT REALLY IS AND UNDERSERVED. AND THAT IF THEIR OPERATIONS OPPORTUNITIES TO UTILIZE EXISTING PROVIDERS THAT ARE THERE TO UPGRADE AND TO COMPLETE THEM- AND FINALLY AYE AYE I CAN ONLY OBSERVE HAT. WE JUST SAW PRESENTATION WITH MULTIPLE LAYERS OF BUREAUCRATIC GONNA. OVERSIGHT AND SUPPOSEDLY WORKING TOGETHER AND ALL OF THAT- THAT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE I THINK TO MOVE OUR OUR FUNDS QUICKLY AND IN A WAY WHERE WE DON'T DEBT. WE DON'T USE THEM IN TIME SO WE LOSE THEM AYE AYE I WANNA RAISE THIS AGAIN THAT THE OPERATIONAL. SCHMOOZING THIS HAS TO BE A PART OF THIS OUR EXPECTATION NEEDS TO BE. THAT THEY'RE SAYING YES WE CAN DO THIS HERE'S WHERE WE WANT TO GET IT DONE. I'M ALS I DO HOW I AM HEARING THAT THE SECOND GO AROUND. OF THAT WE GET PAST THE EIGHTEEN. IS NOT GOING TO FOCUS- SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UNDERSERVED AREAS AND SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS A LITTLE MORE. EFFECTIVELY I THINK SO I WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT- AND- MY VOICE HERE WILL. WILL BE FOR THOSE AREAS THAT ARE REALLY UNDERSERVED VERY EXPENSIVE TO GET TO THAT TO THAT LAST MILE THE MIDDLE MILE HELPS BUT AT THE END OF ALL OF THIS. I HAVE A LOT OF. SCHOOLS THAT DON'T HAVE INTERNET OUT IN THE RURAL AREAS A LOT OF AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS THAT CANNOT CONNECT- AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE IN THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE OF THAT WILD. FIRE AREAS AND THE URBAN URBANIZATION AREAS WHERE THERE ARE CONCERNS OVER RELIABILITY IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO. I REALLY APPRECIATE. WHERE WE'RE HEADED. I DO WANT TO REMIND US THAT SB ONE FIVE SIX REALLY WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE UNSERVED AREAS AND I THINK WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING. WE'RE NOT OVERBUILDING AND THAT WE'RE GETTING IT DONE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES WITH A VERY. BIG PRICE TAG AND SO I'M HOPING BY THE END OF THE DAY. WILL BE ABLE TO SIT HERE AND SAY WE GET IT- INSTEAD OF WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE WAY. DID THIS TURN INTO A- THE BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE THAT- MADE BIG PROMISES BUT COULDN'T KEEP THOSE PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE. OUT WE DO HAVE BUREAUCRACIES IN THE STATE. THAT HAVE OPERATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAVE MADE BIG PROMISES AND IF NOT PERFORMED. AND I BELIEVE THAT PART OF THE CONCERNED WE OUGHT TO BE RACING HERE. IS THAT WE HAVE THE P. YOU SEE AND WE HAVE THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF- TECHNOLOGY. AND MY EXPERIENCE HERE. HAS BEEN. THAT THOSE TWO ENTITIES ARE. SOMETIMES LESS THAN RELIABLE. AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND BE A CHEERLEADER NOT JUST A POINTING FINGER BUT A CHEERLEADER FOR THEM. TO DO THIS IN A STREAMLINED WAY IN A WAY THAT SAYS YES NOT NO WAITER MAY BE. AND- THANK YOU I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME CONSENSUS HERE THAT. WE CAN MOVE IN THESE DIRECTIONS. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GONNA KEEP REPEATING I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL- WOULD DENY AS- REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MIDDLE MILE WE HAVE SAID THIS MANY TIMES AND THAT'S OUR EXPECTATION ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. BUT MRMETZGER EVEN SB ONE FIFTY SIX. IN THE LANGUAGE IT SAYS THAT THE COMMISSION SHALL UPDATE THE LOCATIONS OF THE MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE COMMISSION DEEMS APPROPRIATE. NO THAT FIRST EIGHTEEN PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND IT APPEARS AT LEAST FROM A HAND OUT THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION WAS A HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION IS FOR THOSE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS. R ARE WE EXPECTING TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IDENTIFIED. QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE ARE EXPECTING TO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IDENTIFIED THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IS THE TOTAL FUNDING AMOUNT. FOR THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK THOSE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS REPRESENT A SMALL PORTION OF THAT AMOUNT- THE FUNDING WAS APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT IS AVAILABLE FOR ENCUMBRANCE AND TELL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURE EXPENDITURE AND TELL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THE ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE IDENTIFIED BELL BEAT EARLY AS NEXT MONTH. I'M WOULD BE USING THE THREE POINT. TWO FIVE. ON WHAT THESE INITIAL EIGHTEEN PROJECTS WILL COST OF THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE. I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT ESTIMATES BUT IT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING YOU COULD REQUEST FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I BELIEVE THAT WOULD HAPPEN NUMBER. THANK YOU MR MUSK. YES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON I THANK YOU MR METZGER- WE APPRECIATE YOUR ROBUST REPORT TO AND- WE WILL BE MOVING TO OUR NEXT PANEL HERE OUR NEXT PANEL HAS SEVERAL A PRESENTER SO I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF POSSIBLE WILL HEAR ALL OF THEM THERE ARE ACTUALLY SIX PRESENTERS- AND THEN WE WOULD ENGAGE AND QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS SO OUR NEXT- PANEL IS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND INITIATIVE AS OF THIS BEEN STATED THEY ARE ALL.

THE CDC WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL UPDATES ON OUR LAST MOMENT WOMAN PATIENT AT OUR LAST MILE HEARINGS LATER THIS SPRING. AS RICARDO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THAT'S REQUIRED IN SB ONE FIFTY SIX THE CPC HAD NINETY DAYS TO SOLICIT AND RECEIVE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON INITIALLY PROPOSED THE MILE PROJECT LOCATIONS ROUTES AND NETWORK DESIGN. PUBLIC COMMENTS RESPONDED TO TWO RULINGS IN REAL MAKING TWENTY DASH ZERO NINE DASH ZERO ZERO ONE. US TWO RULINGS ON THE FIRST WEEK IN AUGUST SIX. THAT RULING REQUESTED INPUT ON MIDDLE MY LOCATIONS AND THEN SEPTEMBER NINTH WHICH FOCUSED ON NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS. DURING THIS PROCESS OVER A HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS COMMENTED WE RECEIVED SIXTY FORMAL COMMENTS AND MORE THAN THIRTY INFORMAL COMMENTS.

THE CDC IS RESPONSIBLE ALSO FOR IDENTIFYING PARTY LOCATIONS THAT MEET A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC OVERLAPPING CRITERIA SUCH AS- THE CAN BE BUILT EXPEDITIOUSLY. IT'S WITH NO MIDDLE MILE ACCESS REGION'S UNDERSERVED BY CURRENT MIDDLE MOM THAT WORKS REGION'S WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAPACITY LOCATIONS THAT ENABLE LAST MILE CONNECTIONS TO RESIDENTS OF UNDER SERVED AT TWENTY FIVE THREE AND ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT HIGH BANDWIDTH CONNECTIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS OR LIBRARIES. BROWN'S IN TROUBLE. SO IN ORDER TO COLLECT AND ANALYZE THE DATA THE CDC COMPILED DATASETS FROM MULTIPLE AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DATA SOURCES SOME OF THESE INCLUDE STATE HIGHWAY NETWORK MAPS FROM CALTRANS MIDDLE MY LOCATIONS CHARACTERISTICS OF OPEN ACCESS DATA STATUS FROM DATA REQUESTS FROM APPROXIMATELY FIFTY CALIBER CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST MIDDLE MILE AND LAST MILE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS SUBMITTED TO THE PC MARKET CONFIDENTIAL.

YES YEAH YEAH. GOOD MORNING CARE QUICK SILVA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TONY NORTON I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER GOLDEN STATE THAT. THE SHAPE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. I HAVE A LONG BACKGROUND IN DEVELOPING NETWORKS OF VARIOUS TIMES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES AND I'M REALLY PLEASED AND HONORED TO BE INVOLVED IN AND CONTRIBUTED TO THIS LITTLE WHILE PROGRAM THAT WILL PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SERVING UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. GOLDEN STATE WAS SELECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AS A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE STATE'S MIDDLE MILE BROADBAND MISSION OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH SB ONE FIFTY SIX IN THAT ROLE OF GOLDEN STATE THAT WAS CREATED ON OCT OUR PARTY I SHOULD SAY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE TO FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THERE WE GO IT'S START OF YOUR P. JUMPED AHEAD ON THE IF YOU COULD PLEASE GO BACK. ON THE SLIDES. AND THEN THE NEXT ONE PLEASE SORRY ABOUT THE CONFUSION. GOLDEN STATE THAT WAS CREATED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AS A NON PROFIT LIMITED LIABILITY CORPORATION UNDER SCENIC THE CORPORATION FOR EDUCATIONAL NETWORK INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU MAY KNOW SCENIC IS WHEN OPERATING THE CALIFORNIA RESTRICTION EDUCATION NETWORK FOR NEARLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED SYSTEM THE CAL STATE SYSTEM AND PRIVATE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES. ARE IN THE STATE CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THEIR OWN NETWORK AS A RESEARCH AND EDUCATION DEDICATED STATEWIDE GATEWAY TO THE INTERNET. OVER TIME SCENIC IS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SCHOOLS PUBLIC LIBRARIES ANOTHER ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS TO ITS MEMBER BASE. IT IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION PROVIDING A CARRIER CLASS CORE BACKBONE NETWORK THAT CONSISTS OF OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND MILES OF FIBER TODAY AND KEEPS CALIFORNIA ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF RESEARCH EDUCATION. THE SCENIC BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE LEVERAGED TO JUMPSTART THE SINGLE MILE NETWORK THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING HERE- AND IT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT MISSIONS OF RESCUE ONE THIRTY SIX. CERTAINLY SHE HAS OVER NINETY EXISTING DURING THE GRIEVANCE FOR TRAFFIC EXCHANGE WITH BOTH A RESURGENT WORKS INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS LARGE COMMERCIAL NETWORKS SUCH AS APPLE AMAZON MICROSOFT GOOGLE AND MORE. AS WITH ALL OF THE COMMERCIAL NETWORKS. EXPORTING AS WITH ALL OF THE LARGEST NETWORKS AND CONSUMERS OF BIG DATA SCENE OCCURS AMONG THOSE ENGAGING IN SETTLEMENT FREE PEERING AGREEMENTS WHERE THEIR COSTS ARE LIMITED TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING AND EXCHANGING TRAFFIC WITH OTHER NETWORKS. ARRANGEMENT ALLOWS FOR NETWORKS TO EXCHANGE TRAFFIC DIRECTLY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND IS A FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE OF THE GLOBAL INTERNET ARCHITECTURE. OFFICIALLY GOLDEN STATE NETWORK- COMMENCED OPERATIONS AS WELL WITH THE STATE I SHOULD SAY AS OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OTHER PARTNERS INVOLVED PURSUANT TO THE STATURE AND FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM TODAY IN THIS PRESENTATION. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AS MENTIONED IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT INITIAL SET OF EIGHTEEN PROJECT LOCATIONS WERE ANNOUNCED AND GOLDEN STATE NOTICE APPROACH YOUR NATURAL. APPROVED LOCATIONS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE OVERALL SYSTEM DESIGN INCLUDING RING ARCHITECTURES TO SUPPORT NETWORK RESILIENCY AND AVOID AVOID THE CREATION OF STRANDED NETWORK ACCESS ASSETS THAT DON'T CREATE ANY FACT. ONE COULD THINK ABOUT SIGNING THE MIDDLE MILE AS RELATED TO PART. ON ONE SIDE IT'S ABOUT CREATING AN INTERCONNECTION FROM THE LAST MILE TO THE LISLE AND ON THE SECOND PART CREATING A CONNECTION FROM THE MIDDLE WHILE TO THE GLOBAL CORE OF THE INTERNET. TO SUPPORT RESILIENT DESIGN. IT'S ABOUT A COMBINATION OF BUILDING NEW OPTICAL FIBER AND LEVERAGING EXISTING FIBER- THROUGH DARK FIBER I HER UNITS WHICH ARE INDEFEASIBLE RIGHTS OF USE BY THE WAY THERE'S A- TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR ON THIS SLIDE- IT SHOULD SAY INDEFEASIBLE RIGHTS OF USE. AS PART OF THIS WORK WE'VE ENGAGED WITH MANY COMMERCIAL PROVIDERS OF BOTH LAST MILE AND DOUBLE MILE. TRIBAL NATIONS. OF READY OF METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS CALTRANS AND- IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE WORKING WITH POTENTIAL LAST MILE PROVIDERS. THE CUSTOMERS IF YOU WILL OF THE MIDDLE MILE TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES REACH THE END USERS WITHIN THEIR NETWORKS. THOSE END USERS OF THE HOMES BUSINESSES TRIBAL NATIONS EVEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE CAN ACHIEVE. OF THE MISSION AND VISION OF THE STATE EFFORT BY SERVING LAST MILE PROVIDERS WITH COST EFFECTIVE. HIGH QUALITY SERVICES ON THE MIDDLE MILE AND ENABLING ACCESS TO THE MIDDLE MILE FO THEM BY MEANS OF A VARIETY OF ACCESS POINTS TO BE LOCATED. IN A COMBINATION OF DISTRIBUTED REGIONAL EXCHANGE POINTS AS WELL CALLING. THE WILL EXTEND OUT INTO THE SERVICE RETURNS AS WELL AS OTHER- OF DISTRIBUTED NETWORK DROPPED AT LOCATIONS YOU'RE CONNECT LOCATIONS FOR THE LAST MILE IF YOU WILL. WITH ACCESS HOLDS UP AS WELL AS RAPID CAPABILITIES AND FIBER REACTIVE TO CATION HUTCH THAT WE LOCATED ON THE NETWORK AND POTENTIALLY EVEN AT EXISTING SCENIC POINTS OF PRESENCE OF WHICH THERE ARE. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR NEXT FLIGHT. MANY OF THE TASKS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NATIONAL EIGHTEEN PROJECT MENTIONED ARE BEING EXPANDED AND LEVERAGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REST OF THE STATEWIDE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK I FORGOT TO MENTION THE LAST FLIGHT BY THE WAY- BUT THIS ALSO INCLUDES OF COURSE ACCOUNTING FOR UP CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICE FUND PROJECTS TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WITH EXISTING LAST MILE EFFORTS ALREADY UNDERWAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO ALLOW FOR THE STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS NETWORK TO PROVIDE NECESSARY SERVICES EXPEDITIOUSLY EXPEDITIOUSLY TO THE GLOBAL INTERNET WE NEED TO CREATE THE NECESSARY INTERCONNECTIONS FOR THOSE LAST MILE PROVIDERS WHO ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THIS IS PART OF THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT WORK FOR POTENTIAL SERVICE ARE FRIENDS- WITHIN THE STATE WIDE NETWORK THAT WE CAN OFFER AND THAT'S CONTEMPLATED BY THE STATUTE OF COURSE. FINALLY WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT. THAT'S THE STATE WIDE NETWORK MIDDLE MILE NETWORK INTERCONNECT AND EXCHANGE TRAFFIC THROUGH AGREEMENTS WITH ALL OF THE MAJOR NETWORKS THAT COMPRISE THE REST OF THE GLOBAL INTERNET. AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH AND WILL BE CONNECTING THROUGH THE EXTENSIVE. CURRENT TRAFFIC EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS THAT SCENIC ALREADY HAS FOR THIS PURPOSE. ABOVE ALL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. POINT OUT THAT TRUE PARTNERING BETWEEN CT CALTRANS THE CPUC AND GOLDEN STATE NOT THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IS WHAT WILL ACHIEVE THE IMPORTANT GOALS OF SB ONE FIFTY SIX TO SERVE THE UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WITH HIGH QUALITY BROADBAND SERVICES AND DO SO AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.

OF REGULATORY DELAY AND UNCERTAINTY. WHY ARE WE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION WHICH ADDS MORE UNCERTAINTY AND MORE APPROVALS TO THESE GRANT AWARDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED YOU VICE CHAIR THAT THOSE ROBERT OSBORNE FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION SO AS YOU INDICATED RECENT CASF INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT- THE CONTAIN MIDDLE MILE FUNDING COMPONENTS- WE'RE REQUIRING THAT GRANT RECIPIENTS MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MIDDLE MILECOMPONENTS ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE PROPOSED MIDDLE MILE BUILD. IT PURPLE PROCESS SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN A THREE MONTH TIME PERIOD OR SOONER- AND- WITH- FROM THAT GRANT AWARD TIME- BUT THAT MAY BE EXTENDED BASED ON MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE GRANT RECIPIENT- WE'VE ALREADY KICKED OFF OUR FIRST MEETING WITH ONE PROVIDER AND WE HAVE TWO MORE THAT ARE PLANNED. TO GET THAT PROCESS UNDERWAY IN REALLY THE INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING INVESTMENT OF PRECIOUS STATE MONEY. ALL RIGHT- A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INITIAL LIST OF EIGHTEEN. I LOCATION IF YOU LOOK AT THE LISTING. BUT IT IT LOOKS AS IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT AREAS FOR WHICH THEIR BRAND BROADBAND SERVICE ALREADY IN THOSE. AREAS AND IT LOOKS TO ME- AS IF THE CD T. APPROVAL PROCESS I THINK THE- REALLY FAILED TO LOOK AT THE UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT LACK TWENTY FIVE THREE SERVICE- AND I THINK THAT. WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK C. T. WHAT ARE CITY T. GOING TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT NEXT BATCH OF LOCATIONS FOR STATE MIDDLE MILE DEPLOYMENT. WILL BE IN UNDERSERVED AREAS LACKING TWENTY FIVE THREE SERVICES AS EXPECTED BY THE ENABLING LEGISLATION. SURE OUR WORK BETTER AGAINST THE DUTY SO- MARK WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU YEAH ARE THERE YOU KNOW- DID YOU PROJECTS WERE AT WERE SELECTED WITH A KIND OF A THAT IS A STEP APPROACH TO REALLY I'M A GUEST BASEDON SOME LIMITED IN THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OUT OF THE TIME. A RELATIVE TO WHERE WE NEEDED THE SYSTEM SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD- ALC- ON OUR WEBSITE- THE MATH THE MATH THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE- UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE- THAT NOW THAT WE HAVE THAT COMPLETE WE HAVE WE WILL BE BUILDING OUT- AND IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM IN RESPONSE TO THAT MAP SO. WHERE IS THE EIGHT THE ORIGINAL EIGHTEEN- WE WANTED TO LEARN YOU KNOW GET A UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BUILD HOW WE CONNECT THAT TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY WORK IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS IN MOUNT AIRY MOUNTAINOUS AREAS IN. DESERT AREAS SO WE WERE REALLY OF TRYING TO TRY TO USE THAT THE MOST OPPORTUNE WEEKEND WITH SB. ONE FIFTY SIX TO GET STARTED. START THAT. OF ABOVE THE LAW TO PUT THIS THING. AND SO ON GOING FOR- ABSOLUTE YOU KNOW THAT IS THAT GOAL YOU WANT TO SIX IS TO. ADDRESS THE NEED AND THE- FOR. ON SERVER UNDER. AND SO- GOING FOR PRICE WILL BE. TO WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT- ASSEMBLY RAYOS. BILL AND THEN ASSEMBLY BONTA AFTER. IN ONE OF THE- HANDELT OF MARC BERMAN ROW I THINK YOUR FIRST PAGE. IT PAGE IS TIED WORKING TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE SB ONE FIFTY SIX AND THE EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS LISTED. HOLDEN YEAR FILLING YOUR FAST. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOMETHING THAT IS SET UP IN A HIERARCHICAL FASHION. WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM WHO IS THE ONE PERSON OR THE ONE DEPARTMENT THAT WE CAN GO TO AND SAY YOU NEED TO GET EVERYBODY ELSE IN ORDER AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHO'S WHO'S IN CHARGE OF WHAT PART OF IT. CAN WE- NO WHO IS ULTIMATELY IN CHARGE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY. IN THE SHORT ANSWER THAT IS IT'S ME BOB IT'S NOT THE- THE MIRAMAR BROADBAND INITIATIVE OFFICE WITHIN- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND SO- YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF IN MY POSITION MY OFFICE WORK WERE REALLY THAT THE FACE OF THAT PROJECT IT'S OUR JOB TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS BUT I'LL SAY IS THAT- WHAT WAS LAID OUT THERE WAS- ON SOME LEVEL- KIND OF BRING YOU SHOW THE FLOW OF THE PROCESS WHERE. OVERALL CD KEY IS- IS GUIDING THE PROJECT ENDED IN THREE FOUR AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT AND THEN YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THERE ARE WITH THE- THE VARIOUS PARTNERS ROLES- WITH THE PC PROVIDING MAPPING- AND THE STATE NOT PROVIDING THAT- THE PROVIDING THAT THAT THAT LED. OF THIS. THAT TO CHECK HEALTH TO GET AND CAL BILL AT SEEING OF THE KIND OF LAID OUT WITH THAT IN. BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW THE- PARKS WITH OUR OFFICE. IT IF I MISTER- ON THE FLY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE ANSWER ON THE SLIDE THAT'S A- WITH THE HEADING FEDERAL FUNDING RULE. IT'S THAT THE THREE TWO FIVE BILL. IS ESTIMATED TO BE ENOUGH BUILD A SIX THE TO A HEN. MILE SIXTY OF THE EIGHT THEY'LL MILES THIS. ACCORDING TO THE ALEJO'S REPORT THE FIRST EIGHT PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN A- ACCOUNT FOR EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED MILES. IT IS MY INFORMATION CORRECT AND ARE WE GOING TO BE ON TRACK TO DO OUR SIX THOUSAND MILES. YES REALLY HOW THE WAY THAT THE SIX THOUSAND MILES WAS DETERMINED WAS- AN INITIAL ESTIMATE BY- CALTRANS IS LESS BRING IN TERMS OF WHAT THESE PROJECTS THAT SOME SMALLER PROJECTS ACOSTA IN THE PAST. WE AND SO WE NORMALLY ASK OF THAT THE WAY CALTRANS IN ANY OF ITS PROJECTS THAT WOULD DEVELOP ITS COST ESTIMATES- IT WOULD DO IT KIND OF STARTS WITH THE A PROJECT INITIATION- A DOCUMENT. PROCESS YOU KNOW HOW WE PROJECTS TAKE A LOT LONGER- BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT MORE INVOLVED IN THIS- AND SO. THEY WERE GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS- TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE COSTS WOULD BE AND SO- IT BECAUSE OF THE ACCELERATED NATURE OF THIS PROJECT GOT CALTRANS ACTUALLY DOING THAT AS PART OF TE PRECONSTRUCTION- PROCESS AND SO THEY ARE. CURRENTLY DEVELOPING THESE THESE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS AND REFINING THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT THE COST WILL. BE SO- DR BROADLEAF. THE OTHER SICK THOUSAND IS. YOU KNOW INITIAL HIGH- DISCUSSION WERE HOPE THAT THE AS WE MOVE. IF A BILL TO ACHIEVE. A SAVINGS- ENERGY FOR YOU KNOW SORT OF SCALE- AND SOME OF THE OTHER COMPONENTS WERE LOOKING AT TO BE ABLE TO MAYBE DRAW DOWN THOSE COSTS THE BUILDING OR- BUT IT'S REALLY THAT THAT THE AND- OF US ONE FIFTY. ONE TO. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUILD OUT A OWNED SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE PHONE- BUT- THAT THAT WOULD COME CLOSER TO FOUR BILLION. THIS SB ONE SIX- CD T. TWO. TO FILL IN THE REST OF THE SYSTEM USING THE AGREEMENT. AND LYFT QUESTION I MAY I ASK EARLY. AND I AM YOU. THAT ARE THE PER TO ASK MR ONE. WHAT IS THE ESTÁ CALL OF THOSE EIGHT PRODUCT THAT OF ALL BEEN. APPROVED IN RELATION TO THE. THREE POINT TWO SIX BILLION. SO ON A BRITISH- WHAT I CAN DO IS ON OF THE THAT THE NATIONAL WHEN WE PUT THE- THIS PROPOSAL LAST SUMMER- I WANT TO SAY IT'S A- IT IT WITH BE THE THREE EIGHTY MILLION RANGE THAT IT'S A VERY HIGH LEVEL THAT IS VERY PRELIMINARY AND PART OF AGAIN THE REASON I WANT TO CARRY OUT THAT IS THAT CALTRANS IS GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF REALLY REFINING THAT NUMBER THAT. AND THAT'S- I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT- SIMILARLY THAT ASSUMES THAT WE ARE- BUILDING- ALL EIGHT HUNDRED YOU KNOW ROUGHLY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES- AND- PART OF THE ASSESSMENT WE'RE DOING IS TO GO BACK AND SEE WHERE WHERE. WHERE MIGHT WE LINK UP WITH EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE- YOU KNOW AND SO THOSE ARE ALL THE PROCESSES THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH SO. IF WE WERE TO JUST ASSUME. ON A STRAIGHT LINE THAT WE'RE HERE THAT WE'RE BAY THEY WERE BUILDING ALL EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES. THEN YOU KNOW ONE COULD ESTIMATE THE THREE HUNDRED. SEVENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR RANGE. BUT AGAIN THAT'S STILL BEING THAT. THAT'S BE REFINED BY CALTRANS. THANK YOU THAT GIVES US HOPE THAT MANY OF OUR OTHER AREAS THE ARE GOING BEING. IN THESE FUTURE PROJECTS IF THIS IS ONLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION THANK YOU MISTER MONROE. THANK YOU ON NEXT ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA. THANK YOU SO MUCH I IT THIS IS PROBABLY A QUESTION DIRECTED TOWARDS MR OSBORNE OR PERHAPS INSTRUMENT ROSE WELL I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE WE SEEM TO BE USING AS A PROXY FOR UNDER SERVED- WHETHER OR NOT AND AT AN AREA IS URBAN OR NOT- BEING INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF THOSE FIRST EIGHTEEN PROJECTS I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM VERY SURE. THAT THERE IS A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN MIDDLE MÀ INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO- SUPPORT VISIT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN IN MY DISTRICT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY AGAIN AND I SEE- MR OSBORNE ON YOUR- ON THE SLIDE ENTITLED CPUC ROLE MIDDLE MILE DATA AND ANALYSIS YOU DO HAVE SOME STATUTORY MAPPING CRITERIA. AND PRIORITIZATION AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS ALREADY INDICATED ACTUALLY MET THE CRITERIA FOR NOT HAVING THE CURRENT RESOURCES THAT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR RECEIPT OF THESE DOLLARS AND- AND TO PARTICIPATE. IN THAT MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC SAID THIS ROBERT ALL FROM THE PEACE. YOU'RE CORRECT THERE ARE PARTS AND URBAN CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE UNSERVED AND UNDER SERVED- WE CALL THEM SORT OF COURT COLLOQUIALLY DONE AT HOLES IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE MISSING BROADBAND IN THE CENTER. SO- YOU ARE CORRECT ON THAT AND YES- THE EIGHTEEN- PROJECT LOCATIONS CONSIDER UNSERVED AND- AS YOU STATED FOR THE URBAN AREAS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOTTOM FINISHED OKAY MEMBER- PERFECT BOERNER HORVATH. YEAH I'M YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS PRESENT FASTER I WOULD LIKE TO DIG A LITTLE BIT INTO THESE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS LIKE I SEE NUMBER EIGHTEEN AS RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO LIKE RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO IS A GIANT AREA LIKE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROJECT AND ONE THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT A MAYBE I MISSED HEARD BUT WHEN WE WERE GIVEN THE EXAMPLE OF THE MIDDLE MILE PROJECT IN NEVADA COUNTY I BELIEVE SOMEBODY SAID THAT A SUPERVISOR HAD SUGGESTED. THIS ROUTE. AND I THINK THAT'S I MEAN IF THAT'S WHAT IT IS I SHOULD HAVE CALLED IN AND I SHOULD REQUEST THE STUFF OCEANSIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE A DONUT HOLE IN OCEANSIDE. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDING. ARE OBJECTIVELY MEETING THE CRITERIA AND NOT JUST- A PROJECT THAT SERVES ONE SUPERVISOR NEVADA COUNTY VERSUS ACTUALLY SATISFYING. THE REQUIREMENTS SET OUT THE BILL. SO MAYBE COULD SOMEBODY COULD GO THROUGH. EXACTLY HOW THESE EIGHTEEN WERE CHOSEN. AND MAYBE LESS OF A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RIVERSIDE SAN DIEGO BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROJECT IS AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT. AND THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I HAVE THAT YOU CAN ANSWER WITH IT. IS- WHAT METRICS ARE YOU USING TO SHOW THAT THESE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS ARE THE BEST USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE HOT WE HAVE THE CRITERIA THE FROM THE BILL BUT YOU MUST AVE THE METRICS OF SUCCESS TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR A BUCK RIGHT SO CAN SOMEBODY GO THROUGH THOSE TWO THINGS BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED. THAT YOU KNOW. WHAT THAT MAYBE WE'RE NOT HAVING THE BEST OBJECTIVE PROJECTS FOR OUR STATE THAT ARE SERVING THE MOST AND SERVE PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIA. SURE HOLD ON YEAH MARC BERKLEY CD KAEL JAPAN AND THAT THE PROBABLY EIGHTEEN WERE CHOSEN WE REALLY WANTED TO GET- BUT WE WANTED TO GET A START ON THIS OVERALL PROJECT AND SO. MAYBE IT AN IMPORTANT THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROJECT THAT THE SIZE IN THE TIME FRAME THAT WERE UNDER IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS- WE NEED TO BE REALLY APPROACHING A BROADER PROJECT- AS A WHOLE RIGHT AND SO THAT MEANS WERE IN THE BUILDING YOU KNOW MULTIPLE SEGMENTS AT THE SAME TIME- WE'RE NOT GOING TO- JUST IN ORDER TO MEET THE TIME FRAME. SO- GIVEN THAT AS WE APPROACH THE- PROD. THOSE WERE. AGAIN THE PRIMARILY ARE THEY WERE BOB. FROM THE STAY ITS PUBLIC PROCESS- YOU KNOW I'M NOT CERTAIN. S. B. ONE FIFTY SIX FOR. THE THEY- DO THAT SUCH MEASURE UNTIL I. WHERE THE ON AND UNDER. ARE AND- TO HAVE A- PROCESS- SO WE GET TO THE PUBLIC PROCESS THESE. YES THEY ARE OPEN TO ANY. AND WE YOU KNOW WE YOU SEE I THINK ALL PARTNERS KERR- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AT ANYBODY TO REALLY ENGAGE IN THAT PART. PROCESS THAT WAS GOING ON IN IN ALL. AND SEPTEMBER- TO REALLY HELP IN. OUR PC'S PROCESSING THEY ALSO WORK- WHAT THE- DIRECTLY TO GET INTO. OF THE HELPING. NOT UP BUT BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE. THAT THE EIGHTEEN. WAS ATTENDED TO IDENTIFY IS WHERE THE GREATEST NEED IN THE STATE IS. THESE OTHER THERE- THE SYSTEM A WHOLE WELL IT IS INTENDED TO. ADDRESS THAT THE STATE NEED AS A WHOLE. ARE THESE IT KRAJ FOR SO. BE THEY WILL GIVE US SOME CRITICS. IN A GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE AREAS- THEY'LL GIVE US SOME EXPERIENCE IN. RURAL AREAS URBAN AREAS AND TRYING TO CONNECT TO EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO- AND AGAIN MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY THAT THE UC HAD. IN ITS ANALYSIS. HAVE BEEN ABLE WAS ABLE TO SAY WITHIN A REASONABLE LEVEL OF CERTAINTY AT STAFF LEVEL BUT- THESE PROJECTS THESE SEGMENTS NEEDED A SOLUTION AND SO. THIS YEAR WE WILL GO FORWARD WITH. THAT- GOING- THE- THE MET. WILL BE VERY MUCH IN YOU GO TO A WEBSITE KIND OF SEE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES- MAPPED- KIND OF DATA FOR YOU COULD IDENTIFY. AND COMMUNITIES AND- THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT'S REALLY WE'RE TARGET SO THAT'S THE- OF THIS MILE. AND CERTAINLY ANY. BEADS GOING FORWARD- ARE GOING TO BE TO. ALLOW THE COLOR THAT INTO SAYS. AND THAT'S REALLY- YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM IS THAT IT WHOLE NOW. IT'S SAYS AND THAT IT ALL PLUGS INTO OF THE- AND GETS EVERY TOGETHER. TO HAVE- THE INTERNET. MHM AND THE THING TONG LIKE TO ASK THE RAW- OFFERING C. P. COULD ALL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ROTH MAY- I JUST WANT AND FOR THE- THAT. OF AT PROBABLY HAVE HER. EARLIER THAT EVENING EIGHT. IT'S S. OF THE INDIAN THAI CALIFORNIA. AND THE ENTIRE. NETWORK IT'S THE THAT THE CURRENTLY IN. ON THE WEB. BASED ON THE GOOD WORK FROM THE WITH STIFF HAVE DONE. IN ROBBING A FEW. PROVIDE BIT MORE CONTACTS ON INITIAL. WHAT CRITERIA THAT WITH APPLY AND HOW DOES THAT CARE OVER- TO- DEVELOP THE STATE TALKING THE IS ROBERT OUT FROM THE PC. SO THE INITIAL PROJECT LOOK STORAGE. TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE OBJECT. FIRST WITH THE TEST APPROACHES FOR THE MIDDLE THAT WERE. AS MARK INDICATED EARLIER. SHE ALSO TO X. PROD AN AIR IN THE STATE THERE WERE. BY OPEN AT MODEL MILE IN FOR. OPEN ACCESS TO KEY WERE HERE BE WE'RE LAUGH MONTH PRICE- THIRD LEVERAGE A FISH. AND WITH PENDING. CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE FOR TO COORDINATE WITH PENDING CAL. MAN SERVICES FUND INFRASTRUCTURE LAST MILE GRANTS THAT INCLUDE MIDDLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THE PROJECTS ARE GROUPED INTO ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE GROUP THINKS THERE IS A GROUP ONE WHICH FOCUSED ON. SERVICE TO UNSERVED AREAS THAT CAN BE BUILT EXPEDITIOUSLY ARE TIED TO SEE PC OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. FOR LAST MILE GROUP TWO WAS FOCUSED ON SERVICE TO UNSERVED AREAS THAT CAN BE BUILT EXPEDITIOUSLY. IN COORDINATION WITH CALTRANS AND GROUP THREE LET'S FOCUS ON SERVICE TO UNSERVED AREAS THAT AVE A GREAT NEED OR OPPORTUNITY AREAS WHICH ARE DEMONSTRATED BY PUBLIC COMMENT. I THINK THOUGH TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL QUESTION- WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC COMMENT THE PUBLIC COMMENT MAP IS A PUBLIC COMMENT MAP IT IS NOT THAT A DECISION ON FINAL. BUILD LOCATION AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHERE TO FINALLY BUILD HAVE TO BE TIED TO UNSERVED LOCATIONS SO IT'S NOT A POPULARITY CONTEST. AND SECONDLY IF YOU DO HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENT TO PROVIDE WE ARE ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENTS STILL ON FRIDAY. IN FORMAL PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WHEN MICHAEL WAS A THE SPECIFICALLY AROUND RIVERSIDE DIEGO. CAN SOMEBODY INTO A LITTLE OF DETAIL ABOUT THE PROJECT. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT PROJECT WHEN IS IT CAN BE DONE HOW MANY PEOPLE IS THAT. I'M I'M HOW MANY PEOPLE DO WE THINK THAT IT'S GONNA SERVE. YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO HAVE METRICS AROUND IT. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS STRETCH ACROSS THIS MANY DOLLARS BUT IT'S GOING TO CONNECT WITH MANY. ARM UNDER OR UNSERVED PEOPLE ARE HOUSEHOLDS HOWEVER YOU WANNA ARE YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT- COMMUNITY USES. WHAT METRICS ARE YOU DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE. TO ENSURE NOT ONLY CAN YOU DO IT FAST AND YOU HAVE SYNERGIES WITH OTHER EXISTING PROJECTS. BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND CALIFORNIA FOR THESE PROJECTS. WHAT METRICS YOU HAVE IN PLACE NOW. THAT SHOW IS THAT THE IS THE BEST USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS NOW. I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MARK ON THAT QUESTION. YEAH SO- INFIRM SERVICES IMPORTER MEMBER THAT MIDDLE MILE NO AMOUNT OF ITSELF DOESN'T- IT DOESN'T CONNECT TO OUR HOUSES RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MY LAST MY BUT YOU HAVE SOME PLAN ABOUT THE LAST MILE USAGE THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT CRAP. RIGHT AND SO WE KNOW ONCE IN AWHILE IS BUILT WILL BE IT WILL HAVE- YOU KNOW LAST MILE THAT CAN CONNECT TO IT- IN TERMS OF. THE THIS PROJECT BEING AHEAD OF OTHERS- I YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT IT WAS THE- WE SAY THAT THE BOOK ABOUT. THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IT WAS IT IS THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE CAN GET IT STARTED NOW. AND WE HAVE A CALTRANS YOU KNOW WORKING OR WORKING WITH CALTRANS TO STREAMLINE THEIR PROCESSES- TO. TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT I'M LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW ALTERNATIVES TO. OPPORTUNITY CONNECT WITH THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH- GOLDEN STATE NOT- BUT I DON'T WANT IT YOU KNOW THAT THE IDEA OF THE INITIAL EIGHTEEN WASN'T TO SAY THESE WORDS. THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. THAT THE STATE WILL COME UP WITH. THAT HAD THAT AT THAT POINT THAT ASSESSMENT HADN'T REALLY BEEN DONE SO FAR- WASN'T COMPLETED UNTIL THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS CONTINUING. JERRY OKAY LET'S CONTINUE TO DO THEIR ANALYSIS AND- AND THIS WAS AN AREA WERE. NEED WAS IDENTIFIED AND THAT'S REALLY WHY IT IT AND. THE OTHER PROJECTS WERE SELECTED. I WOULD FORWARD. I UNDERSTAND THESE WERE ONES THAT CAN BE DONE NOW NEVER SYNERGIES. BUT GOING FORWARD FOR THE REST OF THE MONEY. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. WHAT OUR METRICS OF SUCCESS WHY ARE WE USING IT HERE AND NOT THERE BECAUSE- THERE'S PROBABLY MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. THAT BEYOND THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE A SIGN AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. AND SAY. THIS IS THE BEST BANG FOR A BUCK. WE ARE INVESTING. OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WISELY. RIGHT AS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU COME UP WITH METRICS SO THAT THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THERE'S VERY CLEAR METRICS ON EACH OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE CAN SAY. IS THE BEST BANG FOR A BUCK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND STILL IF SOMEBODY CAN GOING TO REPRESENT SAN DIEGO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- I WANT TO AS CHAIR. TO THANK ALL OF THE- SPEAKERS THAT WE HAVE TODAY AS WE CAN SEE THERE ARE A LOT. OF PLAYERS IN THIS. INITIATIVE TO BRING BROADBAND TO ALL IN CALIFORNIA I'LL JUST MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS- I WOULD SAY I THINK SOME OF THE- CONCERN YOU'RE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS. IS IN MANY WAYS. THEY'RE HEARING SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE HEARD. AS A MYSELF IN A PARTICIPANT ON THE MIDDLE MILE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS SOME OF THE SAME- AREAS OF HOW WERE THE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS- DECIDED UPON. AS WAS MENTIONED WHAT IS THE CRITERIA BUT I THINK THE CONCERN IS WHEN WE LOOK OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WILL WE IN FACT BE ABLE TO COMPLETE. AND PROVIDE BROADBAND ACCESS TO ALL AND SOME OF US WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN PROJECTS WHETHER THEY BE IN TRANSPORTATION OR OTHER SYSTEMS I THINK SME OF THE FEAR IS WILL WE RUN OUT OF MONEY WELL WE NOT USE IT IN A TIMELY WAY. AND THEN IN THE END WHEN WE STILL HAVE AREAS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED THAT WE DID NOT GET TO SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE OVERALL- COMMENTS THAT I THINK- ARE BEING EXPRESSED TODAY. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A YOUR FIRST REPORT COMING MARCH FIRST- I THINK THERE THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT OF INTEREST IN THAT AND WE WILL CONTINUE AS A COMMITTEE. TO NOT ONLY ON ENGAGE BUT MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS TO BE UPDATED- WE WILL ALSO BE HEARING- DOING A SECOND INFORMATIONAL HEARING EARLY APRIL ON THE LAST MILE SO AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK YOU WE KNOW THAT TED THIS IS NOT AN EASY LIFT LIFTING ANY MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEED A HEFTY LEFT WE JUST ALL WANT TO. AS MY CO CHAIR SAY WERE IN A SAID WE'RE IN A GOLDEN MOMENT AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT ACTUALLY COME TO FRUITION BUT AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP TO- PUBLIC. M. MEMBERS AND. YET WE MENTIONED THE PHONE NUMBER AT THE VERY BEGINNING I WILL GIVE IT ONE MORE TIME- IF YOU ARE CALLING IN AND FOR THIS HEARING THE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR. THREE SEVEN AND WE WELCOME YOU'LL WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS THAT ATTENDED TODAY I FOUND OUT A LOT OF ROBUST INFORMATION. TO THE PUBLIC. BUT WE HAVE ONE IN PERSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH A CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION ONE OF THE LARGEST INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING THIS IS A VERY GREAT DISCUSSION AND I THINK WE'RE OFF TO A GREAT START. I WANTTO DIAL BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR WHAT IS YOUR CHALLENGE HERE BECAUSE A YEAR A LOT ABOUT THE LAST OF THE MIDDLE MILE IN THE UNSERVED SO- CALIFORNIA HAS THIRTEEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION HOUSEHOLDS AND MR PATERSON ALLUDED TO A FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE UNSERVED THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE AFTER THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON HALF OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE IN THE ROOM AND HALF OF THOSE ARE URBAN BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROBLEMS ARE IN THE RURAL AREA YOU HAVE LACK OF DENSITY AND HOME SPREAD OUT FOR PARTNERS THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONNECTIVITY OUT THERE. IN AN URBAN SEARCH AND CENTER YOU HAVE POCKETS IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF CHALLENGE IT'S ONE THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE MIDDLE MILE IT REQUIRES BUILDING UP THAT LAST MILE TO THESE UNSERVED POCKETS SO YOU CAN GO WITH A VERY COSTLY APPROACH OF DUPLICATING MIDDLE MILE AND URBAN AREA. BUT REALLY THE CHALLENGES IS GETTING TO THAT LAST MILE HOUSEHOLD SO SOME OF THESE POCKETS OR LIKE PUBLIC HOUSING. IT WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECISION NOT TO BUILD BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IN THOSE UNITS WHEN THEY WERE BUILT SO SOMETHING MIGHT LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE TO REQUIRE PUBLIC HOUSING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE BILL PUBLIC HOUSE AND THEY HAVE IT SOME OF THEM MAY BE- TRAILER PARKS- MOBILE HOME PARKS SO THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER DO NOT A LOT SO YOU HAVE SOME PROPERTY RIGHTS ISSUES THAT YOU NEED TO BE CHARGED WITH. FIRST CONNECTIVITY OUT IN THE STREET SO YOUR CHILD FROM URBAN RURAL IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT FOR UNSERVED OF MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE URBAN AREAS WHEN I THINK A LOT OF LEGISLATORS STOP THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY AND OUR HELP LOS ANGELES AREA. IT WAS NOT THAT THERE WASN'T A SERVICER BUT THERE WAS NO PORTABILITY ISSUE OR THE HOUSE OF DIDN'T ADOPT SO THERE'S. ONE POINT NINE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT COULD NOT BROADBAND. BUT DID SOLEIL. CC SPONSOR TWO PIECES ALLEGE. TO GET. A K. TWELVE STUDENTS CONNECTED TO GET PUBLIC HOUSING AND CONNECTED. UNFORTUNATELY RUSTIC SESIL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO. YOU KNOW ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. SO THAT'S YOUR CHALLENGE HOW TO GET TO THESE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. SIX BILLION DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY SO YOU NEED TO USE IT WISELY. WE WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU FOCUS ON THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE IN THREE. SO THAT SHOULD BE YOUR TARGET- AND LASTLY I WANT TO MENTION ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT PILOT PROJECTS. MIDDLE MILE PROJECTS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL- I THINK IN THE FUTURE. THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS. THERE WAS THE THREE NINETY FIVE DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE THAT GOES FROM BARSTOW TO RENO IT COST A BILLION DOLLARS. IN YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT HOW WE'RE HOUSEHOLDS CONNECTED IN THOSE PROJECTS AND IN THAT PROJECT. SO IT GOES THROUGH FIVE RESERVATIONS I'VE HEARD THAT- THE HEAD OFFICE WILL HAVE CONNECTIVITY BUT THE ACTUAL HOUSEHOLDS ON THOSE RESERVATIONS DO NOT. SO I WOULD GO DOWN ON THAT PROJECT FOR THE TWO NINETY NINE DIGITAL TO NINE NINE PROJECT THAT GOES FROM- EUREKA OVER TO REDDING COTTON WOOD. AND THAT WAS A FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE THE PROPONENT WANTED TO DOUBLE THAT SO HE SAID THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH SO THAT PROJECT FAILED. SO WE HAVE PROJECTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA YOU DON'T NEED TO GO YOU DON'T NEED TO DO PILOTS SO MUCH YOU NEED TO GO DRILL DOWN AND LEARN AND TAKE THE LEARNING LESSONS FROM THOSE PROJECTS. AND I WILL LEAVE IT OPEN IT ONE LAST SHOT OUT TO A CALTRANS. SO CALTRANS HAS BEEN A GREAT PARTNER IN THE PAST SO I THINK MR WHICH NOT HERE BUT UNDER THE DIRECTION MISTER WOULD. YES ENCOURAGE CALTRANS TO WORK WITH IS PIECE AND WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THAT AREA. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- AGAIN IN OUR PANDEMIC WORLD I WAS JUST SURPRISED TO SEE SOMEBODY IN PERSON HERE SO. THANK YOU FOR COMING NEXT. HI MY NAME LATER ON THE POLLING HIRING. I PURCHASED MY NAME'S DAN SANTOS AND- I'M- WITH COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND- ALSO DISPLACING TECHNICIAN WITH EIGHTEEN T. FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS GOOD TO SEE YOU MISTER PATTERSON- I'M ALSO FROM FRESNO. AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IT'S THE HEART OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY VALLEY OF GREAT WEALTH AND EXTREME POVERTY- WE ARE ALSO THE VALLEY OF THE DIGITAL DESERT IS WHAT I CALL IT. AND WHAT I'VE DONE AND I'VE LAST WEEK I WORKED IN FIREBALL BEFORE THAT I WAS WORKING IN MENDOTA WORKING ALL OF PRESENTS WEST SIDE. AND OTHER TECHNICIANS WORKING IN THE SAID WE'RE STILL COPPER NETWORKS THAT ARE LIKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD THE TECHNOLOGY GIVES YOU A- DATA SPEED OF ABOUT. SIXTY TEN MAGS STILL BUILDING IT RIGHT NOW. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT- YOU KNOW. I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO HONOR THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. OF LIKE WHAT WAS. SPARKED THE DEPLOYMENT OF RURAL ELECTRIFICATION. AND THE TELEPHONE SERVICE IT'S GOT TO BE UNIVERSAL UNIVERSAL SERVICE. IT'S ALSO GOT TO BE A SERVICE WHICH HAS TO LIE ON A DURABLE NETWORK AND THAT NETWORK- IN OUR VIEWS AS A TECHNICIAN HAS TO BE AN OPTICAL FIBER NETWORK. AN OPTICAL FIBRE BACKBONE WILL SERVE YOU FOR GENERATIONS MAY COST MORE TO BUILD TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BUT IN THE END. YOU'RE DONE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND- THOSE LITTLE CRITTERS CALLED SQUIRRELS NETWORK BUT THERE'S A SOLUTION YOU KNOW YOU HARDEN THE NETWORK YOU HARDEN THE AERIALS YOU UNDERGROUND WHERE YOU CAN. I'VE SEEN UNDERGROUNDING GOING ON BUT IT. THESE COMPANIES THEY DON'T WANNA UNDERGROUND THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE EXPENSE. I'VE BEEN IN PLACERVILLE WHERE THERE UNDERGROUNDING CONDUIT IN THE FIRE AREAS. YOU SEE THAT TELEPHONE POLES WITH THE TELEPHONE WIRE CRISSCROSSING THE ROAD FIFTY FEET FROM WHERE THE UNDERGROUNDING IS GOING ON IN THE REFUSING TO DO IT. BUT LET ME GET BACK TO ANOTHER PROBLEM WHICH IS. IT'S SUCH A HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD THIS BIGGEST ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN MY LIFETIME PROBABLY WE DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICIANS TO DO IT AND SO MANY CASES WORKERS TRYING TO BUILD A PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE TRYING TO START TO BUILD THE CAPACITY WITH SOME OF THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO HELP PEOPLE GET QUICKLY INTO THOSE JOBS WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS IF YOU GO TO THE JOB WEBSITES THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TECHNICIANS THE TECHNICIANS OF US THAT ARE THERE ARE OVERLOADED WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE DAY TO DAY WORK LET ALONE VANDERBILTS AND LET ALONE THIS HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE. PROJECTS SO I JUST HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THIS AND LET'S GO WITH IT AND PARTNER WITH US TO THE EXTENT WITH WHOEVER IS OUT THERE DEVELOPING THE CAPACITY WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO STRENGTHEN THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THOSE PIPELINES AND THEN EVENTUALLY BRING THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND DISPLACED WORKERS FROM OTHER. INDUSTRIES LIKE THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY'S FOREVER. BRING THEM INTO THIS PIPELINE THAT WILL GIVE THEM THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE I THINK IT WOULD BE THE- A GOOD INVESTMENT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S PART OF YOUR BUDGET. BUT I THINK THAT YOU CAN FIND THE MONEY AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT'LL MAKE YOUR PROJECT MORE SUCCESSFUL. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE HIGH ROAD IT'S GOT TO BE GOOD PAY GOOD TRAINING. OSHA CERTIFICATIONS IN OPTICAL FIBER ALL OF THE SKILLS TO GOING TO BUILDING A NETWORK WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT. WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP THE PHONE LINES CAN WE FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE ON THE LINE JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO RUN OUT OF TIME. BEFORE WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM- RIGHT. TWELVE THIRTY IF YOU WANT ME VERBALLY TELL YOU THAT. YES IF YOU CAN YEAH SURE I'M I'M SHOWING FIVE- FIVE PARTIES HAVE DIALED AND GOT ONE AND Q. RIGHT NOW FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COMMENTS LIMITED WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WE JUST DON'T WANT WANT TO RUN HAVE TAUGHT OUT OF THE TIME BEFORE WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM. WELCOME THANK YOU AND IT IS ONE ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD WE'LL GO FIRST TO LINE NUMBER SIX I AM SORRY NINE NUMBER EIGHT. LINE EIGHT YOUR YOUR YOUR OPEN STE STE OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. MY NAME IS CHARGED LEO TODAY REPRESENT THE PRODUCTS HERE FROM. YEAH HAVE BEEN THE FOR AND STARTING THE FUTURE OF BROADBAND ACCESS AND UNCLES THE DEPLOYMENT OF UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE AND COMPETITIVE HIGH SPEED NETWORKS. UNDER THE INFRASTRUCTURE LAW THE CPUC AT THE V. P. IS PASSED WITH IDENTIFY AREAS THAT LACK MIDDLE MILE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MEET THE CONDITIONS OF OPEN ACCESS. SUFFICIENT CAPACITY AND AFFORDABLE RATES. HAVING MIDDLE MILE OF THE TRUCK IS NOT ENOUGH CAPACITY AND BE AFFORDABLE. WITH THOSE THREE CONDITIONS THAT MIND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND INFRASTRUCTURE LAW AND THE CPUC HIS GOAL IS CLEAR. I DON'T AND FACILITATE THE COMES. OPEN FUTURE PROOF AND A NOW. WE NEED LEVERAGE PUBLIC DOLLARS TO THEM THAT WILL LAST GENERATIONS. THE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE RESULTED IN YOUNG GIRLS IN SALINAS SITTING OUTSIDE A TACO BELL THE TO TRY AND GET A SIGNAL FOR SCHOOL. IF WE BUILD AND BUILD BOLDLY THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. BEFORE WILL APPROVED GROUP ACCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL DO MORE THAN JUST AND DIGITAL DIVIDE IT WILL ALSO ENDED EQUITY DIVIDE IN BROADBAND. OFFERING OPTION TO THE MANY WHO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS BUT SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD IT. A SUPER MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS CONSIDER BROADBAND AS IMPORTANT THEIR LIVES AS ELECTRICITY AND WATER. IF THE LEGISLATURE. OF SB ONE FIVE SIX REFLECT THE IMPORTANCE. BUT THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE PALATABLE WORKS TO PARK ON THE STRONIE. LET'S MAKE THE MOST OF IT AND BUILD A BETTER FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE NUMBER THIRTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI THIS IS SHANE A ENGLAND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION CONTROL I CLEAN THAT STUDENTS. AND CRIED AND CALLING TO EXPRESS OUR CONTINUED STRONG SUPPORT ALL OF THE STATES INVESTMENT IN BUILDING OF PUBLICLY OWNED OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK AND ALSO IN THE STATE STRONG OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROCESS. WHILE THIS NETWORK COULD BRING US ONE STEP CLOSER TO BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. PRECIADO DEEP DIVE INTO COMMON. I AM SORRY TO THE PROJECTS MY IN A LARGER ISSUE. AND THE QUESTION THAT WISH ASK FOR ROUND THE START OF OVERALL APPROACH- THAT'S NOT. AND THE COMBINATION OF BILLS BY AND PICK WE- THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED. TO ENSURE THE STATE IN I ATTACK IN THE- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE TO THE BUILDER. DURABLE PERMANENT AT. WITHOUT LAW TERM LIFE FOR THAT IS ONLY JOB FOR. BENEFIT OUT WE HAVE ANY OF THIS CAN BE DONE BY. A AND- BECAUSE THAT WE THE LEAGUE OF ALL I. ASSEMBLY FUTURE ON. WHEN SIGNIFICANT MY- AND ALSO WITH AGAIN SAME PER. I'M NOT TO ENTER AVAILABLE FOR A HIGH THE TERM. FOR ACCESS TO PASS. AFFORDABLE AND RELY INTERNET. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE LOOK TO CONTINUING TO GET CAN'T. THANK YOU. AND THEN ARMY ANY OTHER PER COMMENTS PLEASE PRESS THE AND THEN AT THE TIME AGAIN IT'S ZERO. AND GIVE ME A MOMENT HERE WE DO HAVE WON WITH AN OPERATOR GIVE US JUST ONE MOMENT. FOR MINOR IS ONE MM ZERO. WILL NOT GO TO LINE FIFTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MELANIE FIGUEROA ON BEHALF OF VERIZON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING I'M FROM VERIZON PERSPECTIVE IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE REALLY NEED AT ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY AND WE NEED TO ENSURE A TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES THAT PROCESS. THAT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING A WIRELESS AND FIXED WIRELESS OPTIONS AT THE HIGH PERFORMANCE BROADBAND ACCESS POINTS.
