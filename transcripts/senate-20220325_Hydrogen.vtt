EARLY MARKET IS. SPECIALLY WORK

00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:09.348
RENEWABLE HYDROGEN. AND IT I

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:11.317
WANNA REMIND US YOU KNOW WE NEED

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.418

BIGGEST REALLY MARKET. IT'S

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:44.417
REALLY UNDENIABLE AS FAR AS THIS

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:45.985
PLACE IS GOING TO. THINK ABOUT

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:51.324
IT WHEN WE WANT TO GET. OUT OF

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.492
THIS IS THAT AS THE STATE. I

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:54.827

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:00.733
ENOUGH THEY AND THAT'S- OUT

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.600
NUMBER HOPE THIS BETTER. MONEY

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:03.970
WE CAN LAUGH. IN A WAY THAT IT.

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:05.538
OUR TRANSIT TO ZERO. I HAVE.

00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:07.139
URBAN TRANSPORT. ENTITIES I'M

00:10:07.206 --> 00:10:08.507
MONEY SIDE WERE. AFTER A

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.408
FINANCIALLY SELF SUSTAINING

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:11.110
EXPANDING LOW CARBON FREE

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:12.979
HYDROGEN MARKET AND REALLY.

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:14.246
INDUSTRY TELLS US IS THE ONLY

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:15.448
PLACE BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.316
ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT YOU CAN

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.418
REALLY HAPPEN IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:10:19.485 --> 00:10:21.387
AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS AN

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.588
INNOVATION OUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.522
WANT CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN HUB

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.257
TO. ACCELERATE GLOBAL ADOPTION.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:27.126
OF LEAN HYDROGEN SO YOU WANT TO

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:28.561
MAKE SURE THAT. THE NATIONAL

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.695
NETWORK IT'S SUCCESSFUL THAT

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:30.830
WE'RE PARTNERING WITH HUBS

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.198
ACROSS THE NATION TO DO THIS

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:33.899
BILL. AND THE INNOVATION IS YOU

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:35.668
KNOW BOTH IN TERMS OF

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.268
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION BUT

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:38.270
IT'S ALSO POLICY INNOVATION. AND

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:40.473
ORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATION. AND

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.274
YOU'LL HEAR YOU KNOW FROM THE UC

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.642
SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE. AND HOW WE

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:45.745
CAN PULL THAT TOGETHER. I THINK

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.213
EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE BUILT ON

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.315
OUR CORE PRINCIPLES AND SO AS A

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:51.417
STATE IF IT GROUP OF AGENCIES WE

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.152
GOT TOGETHER TO DRAFT A FEW WET

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:54.920
WINTER FOR PRINCIPLES FOR.

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.722
HYDROGEN WE'RE PRIORITIZING ZERO

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:57.890
LOW CARBON HYDROGEN OR GREEN

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.225
HYDROGENS THAT INCLUDES YOU KNOW

00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:01.027
BROAD DEFINITION. REALLY FOCUS

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:04.130
IN ON CARBON INTENSITY- WE WANT

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:04.630
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.365
INVESTING IN THE SYSTEM. TAKING

00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:07.833
A MULTI SECTORAL APPROACH THE

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.934
OPTIC THAT YOU'LL HEAR A LOT

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.269
EVEN FOR THREE HUNDRED A

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.837
COALITION ABOUT HOW THAT. PULLS

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:14.407
TOGETHER- IT'S THE IDEA THAT

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.541
PUBLIC POLICY ENABLES REALLY

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.243
MARKETS AND PRIVATE CAPITAL

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.278
REALLY SCALES THAT. AND WE WANT

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.880
TO PRIORITIZE THE HARDEST TO

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:22.281
BATES SECTORS WITH THE BIGGEST

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.783
EMISSIONS PROFILES AND THAT'S

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.017
OF. HYDROGEN SWEET SPOT AND

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:26.519
REALLY FOCUS ON READING

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:27.920
ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE MARK AT

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.322
THIS. YOU KNOW ALL INCLUDES- YOU

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:31.991
KNOW. ROBUST WORKFORCE AND

CREATING ACTED THAT ACCESS IS

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.228
LIKE HE SAID SENATOR ARCHULETA.

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:37.496
FINALLY WE WANNA MAKE SURE

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:38.564
FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:46.105
COMMUNITIES OF. THE LARGEST

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.140
POLLUTION- AND SO WHAT ARE THE

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.042
HARDEST TO BE EXACT. I BUT FORCE

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:52.244
A LOT OF WORK ON THAT AT HERB

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:53.579
HAS. A RESOURCE FOR AND MAY WORK

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.247
ON THIS BILL BE PLAN. I'M NOT

00:11:55.314 --> 00:11:57.483
GONNA THROUGH ALL THE OF THIS%

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.051
LIFE AT THE IS FROM MODEL- AND

SO YOU KNOW WHERE DO WE NEED.

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:02.221
NEEDED NEEDED ELECTRIC ELECTRIC

00:12:02.288 --> 00:12:03.255
POWER WE NEED AN INDUSTRIAL. AND

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:04.690
THEN ALL OF THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.258
BE ABLE HYDROGEN IS ENERGY

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:07.259
STORAGE THAT'S REALLY ACROSS

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.494

ONE HUNDRED ANALYSIS. TO MAKE

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.636
SURE THAT HYDROGEN IS BEING PUT

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.371
TO ITS BEST. AND THEN. WHAT'S

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.239

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:14.359
CLIMATE CHANGE AND A HOST OF

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.228
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT'S EVIDENT IN

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.596

THIS HEARING TODAY GREEN

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.649
HYDROGEN IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:39.885
OF OUR PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. THAT

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.920

GOVERNMENT IS ALSO PUTTING HIGH

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.430
PRIORITY ON CLEAN ENERGY AND

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:53.866
HYDROGEN THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.701
OF ENERGY'S HYDROGEN PROGRAM.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.002
THE DEAL WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:58.337

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.130

CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.313
IN CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE

SOMEONE A SKIP THROUGH THAT- AS

AND HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:15.473
WE HAVE RECENTLY PULLED TOGETHER

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.708
WITH THE L. A. ECONOMIC

00:31:16.774 --> 00:31:19.077

THAT LEGISLATION AND FUNDING

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:29.220
LAST YEAR. FOR A BILL BACK

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:32.290
BETTER REGIONAL. GROUNDS AND- OF

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.459
THAT GROUP IS NOW POISED TO ROLL

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:36.361
UP ITS SLEEVES AND WORK ON YET

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:37.128
ANOTHER VERY COMPLICATED

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.296
SOLICITATION WHEN THE

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.998
SOLICITATION COMES OUT IN MAY.

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.966
BUT THEN BY ADDING. OUR

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.102
PARTNERS. FROM THE HYDROGEN

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:46.070
COMMUNITY THAT THAT MANY OF US

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:47.405
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR SOME

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:49.340
TIME FOR THIS SPECIFIC PURPOSE.

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.842
SO WE FEEL THAT IN ADDITION TO

THE PEOPLE HERE FROM TODAY THE

00:31:52.377 --> 00:31:53.811
PEOPLE THAT- GO BILLS WORKS WITH

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:56.047
THE OTHER NETWORKS. THAT YOU'LL

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.849
HEAR ABOUT THAT WE HAVE A VERY

00:31:57.915 --> 00:31:59.150
POWERFUL ONE HERE IN SOUTHERN

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:01.386
CALIFORNIA THAT CAN HELP. DRIVE

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.488
MUCH OF THE GOALS THAT WE'RE

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:04.989
LOOKING FOR HERE- THE KEYSTORE

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.824
LEADERSHIP AGAIN AS YOU'VE HEARD

00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:08.726
IS THAT- WE'VE ALREADY GOT THE

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:09.327
RAPID EXPANSION OF RENEWABLE

00:32:09.394 --> 00:32:10.495
ENERGY IN OUR STATE WE HAVE

00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:12.130
THESE GOALS THAT HAVE BEEN SET.

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:14.899
IN POLICY. AND I THINK THAT

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:19.904
LEADS THE NATION IT'S SO. FAIR

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:21.272
TO SAY. AND ALTHOUGH CLICK

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:22.573
THROUGH THESE SLIDES VERY. IN A

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.375
THERE. LATER BUT HIGH. THAT

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:26.678
CALIFORNIA I THINK SHOULD BE

00:32:26.744 --> 00:32:28.413
GIVEN A PRIORITY OR OTHER STATES

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:29.881
THAT HAVE LAID THE POLICY

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:31.182
GROUNDWORK AND THIS IS SOMETHING

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:32.684
THAT WHEN WE SUBMITTED. THE

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.686
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. TO THE

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:37.221
DEAL WE A WEEK OR SO AGO- ABOUT

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.123
THE HYDROGEN HUBS. WE SUGGESTED

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.192
THAT PRIORITY BE GIVEN OUR

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.928
SCORING THE GIVEN. TO ANY STATE

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.096
THAT HAS LAID THE POLICY

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:46.364
GROUNDWORK AND IT'S EXTREMELY

00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:48.399
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE OTHER STATES

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:49.534
THAT HAVE NOT THAT ARE GETTING

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.703
INTO THE HYDROGEN- INDUSTRY FOR

00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:53.538
THE FIRST TIME. WILL THEN HAVE

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:55.039
TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ABOUT

00:32:55.106 --> 00:32:57.208
PERMITTING AND SITING ON. SAFETY

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:59.010
ON ALL KINDS OF OTHER ISSUES FOR

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:01.112
THE FIRST TIME AND THAT WILL

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:05.483
DELAY IMPLEMENTATION. WHAT WILL

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.752
COME OUT IN MAY. IT'S GOING TO

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:08.886
EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MONEY NEEDS

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.288
TO BE SPENT ON THINGS THAT CAN

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.557
BE COMMERCIALIZEDRAPIDLY. AND

00:33:12.623 --> 00:33:13.825
THAT'S ONLY GOING TO HAPPEN IN

00:33:13.891 --> 00:33:15.126
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA WHERE

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:17.328
WE'VE HAD. SUPPORT FROM. US

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.097
SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS WHEN

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.599
WE'VE HAD SUPPORTING LEGISLATION

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.234
WHEN WE'VE HAD A WIDE VARIETY OF

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.602
POLICIES WHICH OF COURSE DON'T

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.405
JUST BENEFIT HYDROGEN BUT- CLEAN

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:29.140
AIR AND CLEAN FUELS AND-

00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:30.174
TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH IN

00:33:30.241 --> 00:33:32.343
GENERAL- WHEN WE'VE SET

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.711
STANDARDS THAT OF COURSE LEAD

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.447
THE WORLD. AND COINCIDENTLY JUST

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:37.982
YESTERDAY I BELIEVE IT WAS THE

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.317
FOR THE BY THE MINISTRATION.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:40.952
REINFORCED CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE

00:33:41.018 --> 00:33:43.354
RIGHTS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT-

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:46.290
TO SET STANDARDS. FOR VEHICLES

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.659
IN TERMS OF CLEAN AIR. ARE WE

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:52.430
ALSO HAVE- BEEN DEVELOPING CLEAN

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:55.032
FLEET ROLES AND ARE SOME OF THE

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:57.835
BIGGEST USERS OF HYDROGEN.

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.203
SOLUTIONS AND HYDROGEN AND

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.072
TRANSPORTATION SO I JUST DON'T

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:03.307
THINK ANY OTHER STATE COMPARES

00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:04.308
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THESE

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.144
THINGS IN GENERAL- IN TERMS OF

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.512
LEADERSHIP THAT IS THEREFORE

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.580
READY TO PUT THIS KIND OF MONEY

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:11.516
TO WORK. SO THE HYDROGEN HUB

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:13.518
THAT WE'RE ENVISIONING OUR ALONG

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.453
WITH OUR PARTNERS AND DR BRAD I

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.121
THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT OF-

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:18.756
OVERVIEW OF THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.291
COLLABORATION. WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.926
THINGS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:23.861
FINANCE AND THEN ONE UNIQUE

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:25.163
ASSET THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.464
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE ALL TO

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.166
SEE CAMPUS. ALL TO SEE IS A

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:31.169
NONPROFIT THAT WAS DEVELOPED. TO

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.904
TO ACCELERATE THE BLUE ECONOMY

00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:34.405
AND WE THINK HYDROGEN IS A VERY

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:36.574
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT FLOW

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:37.809
KANA- THE SLIDE DECK THEN GOES

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.644
INTO THINGS THAT AGAIN MANY OF

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.446
YOU MAY KNOW HOW IS HYDROGEN

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:42.780
PRODUCED ELECTROLYSIS IS ONE OF

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.449
THE WAYS TO DO THAT. WHICH CAN

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.251
BE DONE WITH- WITH- OF SOLAR AND

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:49.020
WIND. PARTICULAR ONE UP

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.988
EMPHASIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.290
WHAT WITH CURTAILED WIND RIGHT

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:54.225
NOW. IS THAT THERE IS WIND THAT

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.359
BLOWS AT NIGHT WHEN WE DON'T

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.328
NEED THE POWER OF THE SYSTEM

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:58.996
OPERATOR SENDS THAT OTHER STATES

00:34:59.063 --> 00:34:59.597
ARE LITERALLY STEPS INTO THE

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.432
GROUND EVEN SOLAR. IS NOW BEING

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:03.634
PRODUCED IN. GREATER QUANTITIES

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:06.037
THAN WE CAN USE OUR AND- THERE'S

00:35:06.103 --> 00:35:08.339
ENOUGH OF HYDROGEN IN THE WASTE

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.041
WATER THAT WE THROW AWAY EVERY

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.275
SINGLE DAY FROM OUR SEWAGE

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.577
TREATMENT PLANTS TO POWER THE

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:13.611
ENTIRE UNITED STATES

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.580
TRANSPORTATION FLEET. SO WE CAN

00:35:15.646 --> 00:35:18.182
TAKE WASTE WATER AND THIS CHART

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:20.518
ARE- CURTAILED RENEWABLES AND

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:22.720
MAKE HYDROGEN OF AMONG THE VERY

00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.255
MANY WAYS THAT THIS COULD BE

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:25.356
DONE IN THE STATE AND

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:30.761
DEMONSTRATED RIGHT HERE. WE ALSO

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:32.363
THINK THAT- ALTHOUGH. WE I KNOW

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.297
THAT THERE'S A- ABOUT FRESH. AND

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.132
NOW GAS AND VARIOUS OF FOSSIL

00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:37.034
FUELS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.336
ALL OF OUR HYDROGEN FUTURE

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:39.770
COMING FROM. FOSSIL FUELS THAT

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.739
BIO GASES- IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.574
SO TO SPEAK. IT'S RIGHT NOW

00:35:43.641 --> 00:35:44.942
GOING UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:46.911
FROM OTHER LAND USES LANDFILLS

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:49.013
AND AGRICULTURE AND- CONFINED

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.049
FEEDLOTS AND SO FORTH. AND IT'S

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.351
TWENTY SIX TIMES MORE POTENT

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.285
HEAT TRAPPING GAS AND CARBON

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.821
DIOXIDE. AND SO IT'S MUCH BETTER

00:35:56.888 --> 00:36:00.424
WE THINK TO TURN THAT INTO A-HYDROGEN AND MAKE USE OF THAT

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:02.260
GAS RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:04.495
DEVELOP THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:06.097
UNDERSTAND THE SUPPLY CHAIN OF

00:36:06.163 --> 00:36:08.466
HYDROGEN BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.201
WILL FOCUS ON GREEN HYDROGEN OR-

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:11.636
WHATEVER THEIR DEFINITION IS OF

00:36:11.702 --> 00:36:13.371
HOW TO MAKE IT- AND THEN OF

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.606
COURSE THE COOL. USES AT THE END

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.475
USES THE CARS I DRIVE A HYDROGEN

00:36:17.542 --> 00:36:19.744
FUEL CELL CAR. OF THE NEW TRUCKS

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.445
AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COMING

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:22.780
OUT USING AT OF COURSE

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:23.614
STATIONARY APPLICATIONS BUT VERY

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.583
FEW PEOPLE BUT LOOK AT THE

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:26.617
DISTRIBUTION UNDERSTAND THAT IF

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:29.020
WE DON'T GET IT FROM WHERE IT'S

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:30.621
PRODUCED TO WHERE. IT'S CONSUMED

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:32.590
OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO RUN INTO

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:34.458
BOTTLENECKS AND SO IT'S VERY

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:35.660
IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN THAT KIND

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:37.428
OF INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL.

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:40.031
STORAGE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:41.832
HYDROGEN AS A MEANS OF STORAGE

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.200
EVERYONE THINKS BATTERIES WHEN

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.869
THEY THINK ABOUT STORING.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:47.305
INTERMITTENT RENEWABLES OR EVEN

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:48.172
FOR TIME VARIANT PRICING AND

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.641
THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT HYDROGEN

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:52.910
IS SOMETHING WHICH I CAN ALSO BE

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.545
USED. AND UNLIKE BATTERIES

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:55.846
DOESN'T DEGRADE I THINK ANYONE

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.348
WHO'S LEFT THEIR CAR FOR TOO

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.150
LONG IN THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.885
AND COME OUT THE BATTERY IS DEAD

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.820
KNOWS THAT BATTERIES DEGRADE SO-

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.622
HYDROGEN WHAT STORE DOES NOT.

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:06.090
AND DEEP DECARBONIZATION HEARD

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:08.125
FROM DR GRANT THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:10.094
THAT CALIFORNIA'S- OF LARGER

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.996
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS FOR

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:13.898
INTEGRATING HYDROGEN INTO THAT.

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.766
LIGHT DUTY TRANSPORTATION WE

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:18.803
ALREADY HAVE- FOURTEEN THOUSAND.

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.304
OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.039
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY FROM

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.441
ABOUT A HUNDRED OF THOSE OUR

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:24.809
TRUCKS ANOTHER HUNDRED BOSSES

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:30.815
THE ROADSTER LIGHTER DUTY. AND.

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.083
AND IT'S GROWING AFTER THE WAY

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:32.617
THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL.

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:34.151
COMPONENT WELL IN MANY SAY THAT.

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.988
ARE TACKLE. MORE EFFICIENT.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.889
BOUGHT OF NOT EVERYONE HAS

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.491
ACCESS TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN

00:37:40.558 --> 00:37:42.326
PLUG IN AT NIGHT AT HOME OR IN

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:44.295
THE OFFICE DURING THE DAY. SO IF

00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.796
WE WANT TO GET ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.565
INTO THE HANDS OF EVERYBODY I

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:48.599
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:49.767
DIVERSIFY. OF THE FUEL FOR

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:51.035
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND SUPPORT

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.169
REMEMBER THAT A FUEL CELL

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.804
VEHICLE IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:55.539
JUST LIKE A BATTERY CAR. IT'S

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:57.308
JUST THAT IT STORES THE ENERGY

00:37:57.375 --> 00:37:58.509
AS HYDROGEN RATHER THAN IN A

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:01.245
BATTERY. AND WHEN WE HAVE TO

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:03.147
LOOK BACK A YEAR OR SO AGO TO

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:04.715
WIN THE TEXAS POWER GRID. WENT

00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.851
DOWN FOR DAYS OF COURSE PUT THEM

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.386
IN THE DARK IF EVERYONE HAD BEEN

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:10.821
DRIVING A TESLA AND- IN TEXAS.

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:12.223
THEY WOULD HAVE ALSO BEEN-

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.624
WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION SO I

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:14.458
THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS THE

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.060
IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSIFYING OUR

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.895
ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION. MEDIUM

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:19.563
AND HEAVY DUTY THOSE WHO DON'T

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.865
TYPICALLY CARE FOR THE LIGHT

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:22.433
DUTY APPLICATIONS OF HYDROGEN

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.668
EVEN THEY WILL AGREE THAT THE

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.803
HEAVY DUTY. YOU CAN EITHER MOVE

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.705
GOODS AND CARGO OR BATTRIES BUT

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.106
NOT BOTH BECAUSE BATTERIES TAKE

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.575
UP TOO MUCH WEIGHT SPACE. AND

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.444
BUT- TAKE LONG HOURS FOR

00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:35.179
RECHARGING SO WHAT'S VEHICLES

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.580
OFF THE ROAD FOR A LONG PERIOD

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:39.116
OF TIME. SO IMPROVING THE-

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.718
ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION OF

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.219
HEAVY DUTY WITH HYDROGEN IS A

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.854
HUGE OPPORTUNITY. AND THEN OF

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.623
COURSE MARITIME AVIATION AND

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.892
RAIL- WITH LIQUID HYDROGEN WITH

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:49.560
OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTING IT

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:51.062
FROM WHERE IT'S PRODUCED TO

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:53.698
WHERE IT IS CONSUMED- PRESENTS

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.232
TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITIES AND JOBS

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:59.837
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. AND-

00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:01.205
CLEANER ENERGY. L. HANDLING

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:02.540
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FUEL CELL.

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.141
IN THE U. TODAY THAT WAS AS OF

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:05.509
TWENTY TWENTY MORE EVERY DAY.

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:06.444
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.479
CONTAINER HANDLING EQUIPMENT

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.314
IMPORTS. TO HELP CLEAN UP THE

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:12.316
AIR ELECTRIFY THOSE SOURCES AS

00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:14.185
WELL- I ONE OF THEM JUST

00:39:14.251 --> 00:39:15.753
HIGHLIGHT BRIEFLY AS I MENTIONED

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.355
I'M THE CEO OF ALL TO SEE IN THE

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:20.057
PORT OF LOS ANGELES. THIS

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.225
PENINSULA THAT YOU SEE HERE IF

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:23.160
YOU CAN SEE MY POINTER. IS OUR

00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.929
CAMPUS AND THESE ARE HUNDRED

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:26.664
YEAR OLD HISTORIC WAREHOUSES

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:28.099
THAT WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.967
OF RENOVATING FACT I APOLOGIZE

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:30.968
FOR THE BACKGROUND NOISE

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.737
THERE'S- CONSTRUCTION GOING ON

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.238
HERE AT THE MOMENT. TO RENOVATE

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:35.706
THESE HUNDRED YEAR OLD-

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:38.609

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.512
BOTH HYDROGEN AND THE BLUE

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.280
ECONOMY. AND SO WITH THE

00:39:43.347 --> 00:39:45.316
UNIVERSITY PARTNERS- COLLEGE

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:46.717
PARTNERS THAT WE ARE WORKING

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.519
WITH. TO INVENT THIS FUTURE IN

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.354
THE BLUE ECONOMY AND HYDROGEN-

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.156
THAT'S WHAT THESE. WAREHOUSES

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.324
WILL BE USED FOR AND THEN WE

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.459
HAVE THIS LARGE FIFTEEN ACRE

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:56.527
SITE THAT IRONICALLY USED TO BE

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.362
AN OIL TANK FARM. AND OTHER

00:39:58.429 --> 00:39:59.630
TANK'S BEEN REMOVED THAT'LL BE

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:01.532
CLEANED UP AND THAT GIVES US A

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.433
PLACE WHERE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.502
PRODUCE HYDROGEN. WITH THE TWO

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:05.836
POINT TWO MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR ON

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.272
OUR ROOFTOP. AND SEA WATER OR

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.507
WASTE WATER AS I MENTIONED

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.208
BEFORE. WE COULD PRODUCE IT HERE

00:40:11.275 --> 00:40:13.778
ON SITE AND THEN. FUEL SHIPS ON

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.546
HARBOR CRAFT ON ONE SIDE AND

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.348
TRUCKS AND- CONTAINERIZED

00:40:17.414 --> 00:40:19.517
VESSELS ON THE OTHER. HERE WE

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.752
ARE IN THE PORT OF. LOS ANGELES

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.687
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHERE WE

00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:24.789
ARE. AND WHEN RENOVATIONS

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.090
COMPLETE OUR WAREHOUSES WILL

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.558
LOOK LIKE THIS WHERE INNOVATORS

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:28.526
CAN COME IN AND BUILD THEIR

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.127
PROTOTYPES DEMONSTRATE THAT

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.263
SCALE. OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:33.597
THE BLUE ECONOMY AND THE

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.699
HYDROGEN ECONOMY. WE ALSO HAVE

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.902
ROLE UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AND BOB

BALLARD FOUND THE TITANIC HE IS-

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.606
LEADER IN UNDERWATER ROBOTICS

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:43.674
AND SENSORS OF COURSE AND IS

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.309
WORKING WITH US ON HYDROGEN FUEL

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.912
CELL OF VESSELS. AND THIS IS

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:50.247
THE- SCIENCE EDUCATION CENTER IN

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.583
FACT WERE- HOPING THAT THE STATE

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:54.351
WILL OF SUPPORT SOME OF THE

00:40:54.418 --> 00:40:55.986
RENOVATION OF THIS. IN THIS

00:40:56.053 --> 00:41:01.525
YEAR'S BUDGET. THIS IS THE PLACE

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:02.526
WHERE WILL HAVE- LABS AND-

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.661
CLASS. OF FOR UNITS. TO WORKING

00:41:03.727 --> 00:41:07.164
ON THE BOOK AND HYDROGEN ECONOMY

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.399
- LAST THING I JUST WANT TO

00:41:08.465 --> 00:41:10.201
MENTION WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:11.535
MAKING THIS A RESILIENCE CENTER

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:12.636
INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T GET

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.138
INTO THAT JUST NOW BUT THESE

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:16.140
WILL BE OF THESE WAREHOUSES WILL

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.608
BE A PLACE THAT IN EMERGENCIES

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:19.443
WILL BE POWERED BY. CLEAN ENERGY

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.744
ARE ALSO WANT TO MENTION FINALLY

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.513
THAT WE'VE ATTRACTED THE

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.747
INTEREST OF THE INVESTMENT

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:26.350
COMMUNITY AND WILL BE BUILDING A

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:27.518
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR-

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.653
HYDROGEN FUTURE FUND WITH OTHER

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.487
INVESTORS FROM HERE IN

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.256
CALIFORNIA NEW YORK THAT A

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.490
PLEDGE TO DO THIS ALONGSIDE A

00:41:33.557 --> 00:41:35.226
HYDROGEN BOMB. SO GOVERNMENT

00:41:35.292 --> 00:41:36.660
MONEY CAN BE USED FOR

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:37.228
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:39.096
INITIAL COMMERCIALIZATION BUT

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.197
THEN WE NEED INVESTORS TO COME

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.833
ALONGSIDE AND ACTUALLY- INVEST

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.169
IN THAT FUTURE. SO I THINK I

ABOUT HIGH DELOS ANGELUS HOW ARE

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:29.079
ARCHITECTING THE GREEN HYDROGEN

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.581
ECOSYSTEM FOR A DEEPLY

00:42:30.648 --> 00:42:33.751
DECARBONIZE LA. I WANT TO- JUST

00:42:33.817 --> 00:42:36.320
EMPHASIZE AGAIN AND ADD ON TO Y.

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:39.089
CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE IS A GREAT

00:42:39.156 --> 00:42:41.959
PLACE. FOR A GREEN HYDROGEN UP

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:43.427
AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:44.595
WORKING ON ONE FOR ABOUT TWO

00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:46.430
YEARS THERE WERE ALSO QUITE

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:48.999
AHEAD OF THE GAME- WHEN I PLAN

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.301
TO DO TODAY IS TELL YOU A LITTLE

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.336
BIT MORE ABOUT THE GREEN

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.904
HYDROGEN COALITION ARE WORK TO

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.407
DATE. AND WHERE WE PLAN TO GO IN

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:58.609
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WITH THAT

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.576
WE'LL GET STARTED SO REALLY

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.312
BRIEFLY ABOUT THE HUGE FEVER

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.846
FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:04.648
EDUCATIONAL NONPROFIT WE WORK.

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.383
THROUGHOUT THE US BUT PRIMARILY

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.085
FOCUSED ON THE WESTERN UNITED

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:10.854
STATES OUR MISSION IS TO

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:11.355
FACILITATE POLICIES AND

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:13.357
PRACTICES. TO ADVANCE THE

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:15.392
PRODUCTION AND USE OF GREEN

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.328
HYDROGEN IN ALL SECTORS WHERE

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.797
DOES XCELERATED CARBON FREE

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:21.532
ENERGY FUTURE- I FOUNDED THE G.

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:26.170
H. TWENTY NINETEEN- I ACTUALLY

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:27.938
WITH THE MEETING THAT WAS HOSTED

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:29.707
BY TYSON AND GO VISIT IN

00:43:29.773 --> 00:43:30.240
SACRAMENTO. AND FROM THE

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:32.710
BEGINNING THE G. H. C. S. FOCUS

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:33.978
IS TO ACCELERATE THE GREEN

00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:36.513
HYDROGEN ECONOMY. BY LEVERAGING

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.283
MULTI SECTORAL OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.285
SIMULTANEOUSLY SCALE SUPPLY AND

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.654
DEMAND OUR PURPOSE IS TO FIGHT

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.689
CLIMATE CHANGE WE ARE ALL ABOUT

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:48.392
ACCELERATING CLEAN AND JUST

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:51.662
ENERGY TRANSITION- I DO WANT TO

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:54.999
DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY GREENHYDROGEN- WE ARE BIG FANS OF

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:56.533
CARBON INTENSITY AND WE HAVE A

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.502
BROAD DEFINITION. AND THAT IS

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:00.437
HYDROGEN THAT IS NOT PRODUCED

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:02.606
WITH FOSSIL FUEL FEEDSTOCKS AND

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:04.942
HAS CLIMATE INTEGRITY MEANING

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:06.276
ZERO OR TO MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:08.045
GAS EMISSIONS ON A LIFE CYCLE

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:09.713
BASIS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.815
PRIOR SPEAKERS FOR RECOGNIZING

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:14.752
THE POTENTIAL OF NOT ONLY ARE

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:17.121
ABUNDANT RENEWABLE ENERGY HERE

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.322
IN THE STATE BUT ALSO WERE

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:19.990
ABUNDANT ORGANIC WASTE

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:23.093
FEEDSTOCKS NOT ONLY. BY GAS BUT

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.063
ALSO BIOMASS. DID YOU CHEER FOR

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.631
THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.333
ITS EXISTENCE HAS BEEN SUPPORTED

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.935
BY A BROADER RANGE. OF GENEROUS

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:34.638
DONATIONS- TRULY REPRESENTING

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:37.007
THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM INCLUDING

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:39.076
STAKEHOLDERS FROM AS FAR AWAY AS

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:41.945
AUSTRALIA JAPAN GERMANY. IN

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:46.316
EVERY. STAKEHOLDER ALONG THE

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.684
VALUE CHAIN. IN TERMS OF ARE IN.

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.019
IN ADDITION I MANAGED ABOUT

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:51.922
IDEAL NORTH IN. ON IN A SECOND

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.091
BUT WE HAVE TO KEY INITIATIVES

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:54.825
ONE IS THE WESTERN GREEN

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:56.527
HYDROGEN INITIATIVE WHICH IS A

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.862
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE GHC

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.497
NAZARIO THE WESTERN INTERSTATE

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.099
ENERGY BOARD AND THIS IS A

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.867
STATE. AND PROVINCIAL LEAD

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.904
ACTIVITY TO FOCUS ON REGIONAL

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.505
CLEAN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:11.708
DEVELOPMENT. IDEAL NORTH AMERICA

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:12.976
IS OUR COMMERCIALIZATION

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:16.680
PLATFORM TO ACCELERATE- LOW COST

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.916
MASS SCALE DELIVERED GREEN

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:21.218
HYDROGEN IN TARGETED LOCATIONS I

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:23.187
DO WANNA GIVE A SHOUT OUT FOR

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:24.388
OTHER WESTERN GREEN HYDROGEN

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.090
ISSUE THERE- DR ANDREW

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:29.093
MCALLISTER- CDC COMMISSIONER.

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.095
HAS SERVED AS ITS VICE CHAIR

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:33.097
SINCE THE BEGINNING ALONG SIDE

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:39.803
OUT WYOMING AND MONTANA AND

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.572
I COMMERCIAL PLATFORM HIGH DEAL

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:44.274
AND- WAS THE FIRST HIGH DEAL

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:45.409
PLATFORM LAUNCHED IN EUROPE BY

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.678
ONE OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS. THE

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.546
IDEA BEHIND HIGH DEAL AMBITION

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.448
WAS TO ACHIEVE LOW DELIVERED

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:55.085
COST- THE IDEA WAS TO FORGET A

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.520
LOW DELIVERED COST WHERE YOU

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.689
KNOW YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION IN

00:45:58.755 --> 00:46:00.824
EUROPE THEY TARGETED ONE FIFTY

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.693
EURO PER KILOGRAM DELIVERED. AND

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:04.561
THEN WORK BACKWARDS FIGURE OUT

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.697
WHAT'S AT WHAT SCALE WHAT THE

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:07.998
OUR SYSTEM PLAN AND THE

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.600
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:11.401
DEVELOPED TO ACHIEVE THAT LOW

00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:13.837
DELIVERED COST ON WHAT HAS

00:46:13.904 --> 00:46:15.772
HAPPENED IN EUROPE AS I'M JUST

00:46:15.839 --> 00:46:17.107
LITERALLY TWO WEEKS AGO THEY

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:19.710
ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF HIGH

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.845
DEAL ESPANA. WHICH IS A FUNDED

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:23.514
ARE VERY LARGE GREEN HYDROGEN

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.416
HUB SIX POINT SIX MILLION TONS

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:28.218
OF GREEN HYDROGEN OVER TWENTY

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:30.087
YEARS ELECTROLYTIC WE PRODUCED

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.955
WAS SEVEN POINT FOUR GIGAWATTS

00:46:32.022 --> 00:46:36.193
OF ELECTROLYSIS PRODUCTION. TO

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.461
START IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

00:46:37.528 --> 00:46:39.062
PART OF THE REASON WHY I

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.764
PERSONALLY EXCITED ABOUT GREEN

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.533
HYDROGEN IS THAT IT'S WITH GREEN

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.134
HYDROGEN WITH REIMAGINE AND

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:46.170
REPURPOSE THE ENERGY SYSTEM.

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.504
THAT WE RELIED ON FOR THE LAST

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:49.239
CENTURY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.775
EVERY ASPECT OF THE VALUE CHAIN-

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.845
WILLING GAS WE CAN RE USE SOME

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.647
CARD FOR ALL OF THAT

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:57.648
INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THIS NEW

00:46:57.714 --> 00:47:00.784
LITTLE TINY POWERFUL MOLECULE.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:02.419
AND AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.288
PRIOR SPEAKERS IT GIVES US THE

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.856
OPPORTUNITY TO DEEPLY

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:07.958
DECARBONIZE ECONOMY WIDE GOING

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:09.693
AFTER THE SECTORS THAT ARE VERY

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.362
HARD. TO DECARBONISE AND WHAT WE

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:15.065
FOUND IS IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:18.068
SO WHEN YOU GO THROUGH- FIRST OF

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.137
ALL EVERYBODY KNOWS TODAY THE

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.338
GREEN HYDROGEN ECONOMY IS NOT

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.106
HERE BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE

00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:25.709
THIS IS A OUR COSTS FOR ALL IN

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.811
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION COSTS NOT A

00:47:27.878 --> 00:47:29.780
DELIVERED COST. COMPARING GREEN

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:32.049
HYDROGEN IN THE GREEN BARS IN

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:33.550
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:34.885
COMPARING THE DOLLARS PER

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:36.353
KILOGRAM PRODUCTION COSTS

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.555
COMPARED TO BLUE AND GRAY

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:40.757
HYDROGEN. IN THE BLUE AND GRAY

00:47:40.824 --> 00:47:42.859
BOXES AS YOU CAN SEE ACROSS THE

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:45.262
WORLD IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.197
ITS GRAMBLING COUNTERPARTS

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.132
THAT'S THE SITUATION TODAY BUT

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:51.068
EVERY SINGLE INDUSTRY ANALYSTS

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:52.936
AGREES. THAT AT SOME POINT IN

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:55.305
THE FUTURE CERTAINLY BY TWENTY

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:57.507
FIFTY GREEN HYDROGEN WILL BE THE

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.943
LOW COST ALTERNATIVE. AS SHOWN

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.381
BY THE- GREEN. GREENS AND DASHES

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:06.250
. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.651
OVERREACH AND COMPRESSED THAT

00:48:07.718 --> 00:48:11.021
REALIZATION WE CANNOT WAIT TILL

00:48:11.088 --> 00:48:11.655
TWENTY FIFTY. WE HAVE A CHICKEN

00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:13.490
AND EGG PROBLEM THE REASON THAT

00:48:13.557 --> 00:48:14.191
GREEN HYDROGEN SO EXPENSIVE

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:15.726
TODAY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.394
SCALED IT. IS COMMERCIALLY

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.696
VIABLE AND BILLABLE TODAY BUT WE

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:20.964
HAVEN'T SCALED IT BECAUSE WE

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:22.366
HAVEN'T SCALED IT WE DON'T HAVE

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:24.101
THE NECESSARY STORAGE AND

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.269
TRANSPORT AND OTHER

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:27.070
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR LOW

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:29.072
DELIVERED COST SO THE ANSWER IS

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:30.874
YOUR SCALE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.644
DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO IMPORTANTLY

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.079
MARKET DESIGN BECAUSE IT'S ONE

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:37.047
HUNDRED COSTS BUT ON THE OTHER

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:39.650
HAND. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.917
FILL OUT TO APPROPRIATELY

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.819
STRUCTURE OUR MARKET AND

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.655
APPROPRIATELY COMPENSATE FOR ALL

00:48:44.721 --> 00:48:46.290
THE BENEFITS AND THIS COULD

00:48:46.356 --> 00:48:48.625
YIELD A VERY HUGE IMPACT AT THE

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:50.093
TIME THAT HE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.828
WHERE TO START WITH HERBS WE

00:48:51.895 --> 00:48:53.664
LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS.

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.265
ON THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:56.700
STATES AND DECIDED THAT SOUTHERN

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:59.803
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE- AMONG THE

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.205
TOP TOP PRIORITIES FIRST OF ALL

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:03.707
BECAUSE OF THE POLLUTION THAT

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.375
EXIST HERE WHEN YOU LOOKED AT

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:08.145
THE FIVE TOPS MOPPED UP SOURCES

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:10.113
OF SMOG IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.214
ALL FIVE OF THEM CAN BE

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:13.684
ADDRESSED BY GREEN HYDROGEN

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:17.287
INCLUDING AVIATION RAIL AND OF

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:23.727
LONG LONG HOMERIC TIME SHIPPING. AS JERRY MENTIONED. OUR VISION

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.063
WITH HIGH DEAL. WAS TO ESTABLISH

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.564
NORTH AMERICA'S. GREEN HIGH G.

00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.933
INTO HIGH ADDS. THE FIRST TO

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.601
ACHIEVE A 100% RENEWABLE

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.470
ELECTRICITY THE CARBONIZED OIL

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.339
REFINING REDUCE SYNTHETIC

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.207
DERIVATIVE DECARBONISE FUELS FOR

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:39.009
SHIPPING AND AVIATION MAYBE

00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.044
SOMEDAY TO PRODUCE FERTILIZER

00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:42.045
HERE FOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.747
AGRICULTURAL BUSINESS.

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:46.516
DEMONSTRATE ZERO CARBON YOURSELF

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:48.952
LIGHT AND SOMEDAY EXPORT MASCHIO

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.254
GREEN HYDROGEN WITH THE FLAG OF

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:53.857
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. SEWER

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:55.125
CREW WHICH IS TO START WITH

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.861
OFFICERS. ON IN AND THIS IS

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.162
REALLY ACTUALLY FINDING AND I

00:49:59.229 --> 00:50:01.331
THINK IMPORTANT FOR ANY. JOB

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:03.900
ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY- TO

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:05.135
REALLY GET STARTED IT STARTS

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:06.570
WITH THE OFF TAKERS YOU NEED

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.338
BANKABLE ONCE AND IMPORTANTLY

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:10.140
OFF TAKERS THAT ARE WILLING TO

00:50:10.207 --> 00:50:12.109
GO FIRST. AND HAVE THE ABILITY

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:14.378
TO SCALE. SO WE STARTED IN THE

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:16.947
LA BASIN AND OUR- APPROACH WAS

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:18.615
CAN WE ACHIEVE SIMILAR EUROPE

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.217
THEY WENT AFTER ONE FIFTY EURO

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:23.854
CAN WE GET YOU. A DOLLAR FIFTY-

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.922
WE STARTED THIS EFFORT FOR PHASE

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.891
ONE IN MAY OF LAST YEAR WE

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:29.993
RECRUITED AN AMAZING PANEL A

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.928
VERY DIVERSE PANEL OF SUPPORTING

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:39.035
PARTNERS AND ADVISORS WILL SHOUT. OUT TO TYSON THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.504
FOR. YOUR SUPPORT AND- OVER THE

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.371
LAST YEAR A HALF. AND I

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:43.673
BASICALLY IN PHASE ONE WE SET

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:44.941
OUT TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION. IS

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:47.411
IT A CRAZY IDEA CAN WE ACHIEVE A

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.879
DOLLAR FIFTY PER KILOGRAM

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:51.181
DELIVERED. BUT WITH THAT THE MAN

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.215
LOOKS LIKE FROM WHICH OFTEN

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:54.084
OCCURS WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.819
NEEDED AND WHAT ARE THE POLICY

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.120
AND REGULATORY BARRIERS THAT

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.822
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SITTING

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.024
HERE TODAY WE COMPLETED PHASE

00:51:01.091 --> 00:51:02.793
ONE AND NUMBER OF LAST YEAR WERE

00:51:02.859 --> 00:51:04.995
ABOUT TO LAUNCH THESE TWO WHICH

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.363
ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.031
BIT BUT FIRST ON PHASE ONE

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.033
FINDINGS I DID WANT TO SHARE.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.469
THAT THIS IDEA IS ENTIRELY

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.738
ACHIEVABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY WE

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:16.773
CONTINUE. UNDER TWO DOLLARS PER

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.909
KILOGRAM DELIVERED BUT IT DOES

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:21.711
REQUIRE THE NECESSARY ASK YA

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:23.447
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE FOUND IT WAS

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:26.483
ONLY POSSIBLE WITH THE 1100%

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:28.218
GREEN HYDROGEN PIPELINE

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:29.586
CONNECTED TO UNDERGROUND

00:51:29.653 --> 00:51:31.455
GEOLOGIC STORAGE IN THE NEAR

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.324
TERM AND THE MEDIUM TERM WE CAN

00:51:34.391 --> 00:51:35.759
GET STARTED SOONER. IT'S GOING

00:51:35.826 --> 00:51:38.495
TO TAKE SOME TIME WE CAN DO IN

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:38.962
BASS AND ELECTROLYTIC

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:41.131
PRODUCTION. WILL BE MASS SCALE

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.299
WE CAN DO SOME BLENDING AN

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:44.201
INJECTION IN THE EXISTING

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:46.136
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE BUT AGAIN

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:47.370
WE KNOW THAT THAT WILL BE MASS

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:52.242
SCALE. EITHER BECAUSE THERE'S A

00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:53.176
LIMITS. HERE'S AN OVERVIEW OF

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:55.111
OUR HAN HE- DESIGN AT THE END

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:56.746
PHASE ONE SURE HERE- THE LEFT

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.648
THE OFF TAKERS CAN BE FOUND IN

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:01.451
THE SMALL BLACK BOX. AND ON THIS

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.753
GREEN LINE INDICATES A BI

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.022
DIRECTIONAL 100% HYDROGEN

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:08.592
PIPELINE THAT CONNECTS. ON VERY

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:10.827
LARGE MULTI SECTORAL OFF TAKERS

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:13.630
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. REUVEN

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.265
UNDERGROUND SALT DOMES IN

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.000
CENTRAL UTAH THAT'S THE LARGEST

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:19.536
PROVEN FALL DOWN IT HAS

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:21.338
BASICALLY UNLIMITED STORAGE.

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.206
THERE NEED BE SALT FORMATIONS IN

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:25.408
SOUTHERN NEVADA IF WE WERE ABLE

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:28.979
TO USE CLOSER SADDAM FORMATIONS.

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:31.081
FROM ABOUT THIRTY FIVE CENTS AND

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:33.984
THE DELIVER COST THIS IS AN END

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.052
TO AND COST- SO PROVEN TOTALLY

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:38.355
ACHIEVABLE TODAY IS A DOLLAR

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.489
NINETY FIVE PER KILOGRAMME

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:40.657
DELIVERED THAT'S WITH NO

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.393
INCENTIVES- NOTHING IT'S A PURE

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:48.498
COST- AT SCALE PROJECTION. ENTER

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:51.334
CAN WITH WHAT THE GOP IS TRYING

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:53.837
TO ACHIEVE WHAT WE SHOW HERE IN

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.238
THE MIDDLE IS A IS THAT EXPANDED

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.941
VIEW OF THIS SMALL AREA.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.276
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.111
WE HAVE OFF TAKERS NOT ONLY IN

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:02.779
AND AROUND THE PORT OF LA PORT

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.981
OF LONG BEACH AND AROUND LOS

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:05.982
ANGELES BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY IN

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.751
VICTORVILLE IN BAKERSFIELD AND

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.419
IT ALSO SHOWS IN THESE RED

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:11.087
CIRCLES THAT WE'VE UNDENGE.

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:13.156
RENEWABLE RESOURCE OUR STUDY FOR

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:15.892
PHASE ONE WITH LIMITED LECTURE

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:17.160
LYTIC PATHWAY IS ONLY JUST FOR

00:53:17.227 --> 00:53:20.263
BY VIRTUE OF SCOPE. ON THIS IS A

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.265
ONE TO THREE MILLION METRIC TON

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.167
MULTI SECTORAL DEMAND PRODUCTION

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:27.137
PRODUCTION PER YEAR. BY TWENTY

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:28.705
THIRTY SERVICES- THIS VIEW WOULD

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:30.073
REQUIRE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.142
DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT THAT'S AN

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.510
END TO AND COST INCLUDING

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.579
UPSTREAM PRODUCTION FOR EXPORTS

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.681
DURING COMPRESSION. I WANT TO

00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.449
RIGHT SIZE THAT INVESTMENT THAT

00:53:39.516 --> 00:53:40.817
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FIRST

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.886
OF ALL MISTER MEMBER A LOT OF IT

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:44.688
WILL BE COMING FROM PRIVATE

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:45.989
SECTOR. BUT IT REPRESENTS ABOUT

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.757
A QUARTER OF WHAT OUR SOUTHERN

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.026
CALIFORNIA UTILITIES WITH FANS

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.661
OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD I

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.563
WANTED TO VOTE MY LAST MINUTE TO

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.265
TALKING ABOUT THESE TWO IN WHAT

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:56.967
WE'RE UP TO NEXT. WE ARE JUST

00:53:57.033 --> 00:53:59.402
ABOUT TO LAUNCH ON FACED YOU

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.237
HAVE HIGH DEAL L. A. AS SHOWN BY

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:04.040
THIS BAR ON THE TOP. AND ON NEXT

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:06.376
STEPS WILL HAVE BASICALLY A

00:54:06.443 --> 00:54:09.112
COUPLE OF REALLY BIG FOCUS AREAS

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:10.981
ONE IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.515
HAVE TO DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:14.184
VALUE PROPOSITION WE HAVE A

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.318
VISION FOR WHERE TO GO. THERE'S

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:17.654
A LOT OF WAYS TO GET FROM A TO

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.356
B. AND PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO

00:54:19.422 --> 00:54:21.725
DO WITH THE COMMUNITY. I IS TO

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.693
EXPAND OUR GREEN HYDROGEN OXYGEN

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.662
CONTENT SO WE DID NOT INCLUDE

00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:27.530
POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:29.132
FUELS FOR MARITIME SHIPPING

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:31.635
AVIATION. AND WE NEED TO DO

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.103
DEEPER DIVES ON THE NEEDED

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.005
INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY WATER

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.940
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT IS THAT

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.575
NO REGRETS INFRASTRUCTURE WE

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:45.849
NEED TO INVEST IN TUESDAY. TO

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:46.650
ACCELERATE PROGRESS. OUR WORK

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:48.718
WILL BE. IN FOR MAJOR MAJOR WERE

00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.253
STREAMS IN OUT WE YOU INTO TO

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.321
CORPS. VERY CLOSELY WITH EVERY

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:54.724
ON CALL LOCAL. AND REGIONAL. AND

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:57.327
OUR OUR GOAL IS TO WORK WITH A

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:58.628
MUCH BROADER TENT OF

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.730
STAKEHOLDERS EVERY STAKEHOLDER

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:03.166
IN THIS JOURNEY HAS AN IMPORTANT

00:55:03.233 --> 00:55:04.801
AND UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO

00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:07.437
PROGRESS. AND THE IDEA IS IF WE

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:09.339
CAN ANSWERING INNOVATIVE AND HOW

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:10.807
WE COME TOGETHER. AS A

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:13.309
COMMUNITY. AND ANSWER ALL THE

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.377
QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE

00:55:14.444 --> 00:55:16.680
ANSWERED WE'RE INNOVATING IN THE

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:17.747
PLATFORM ITSELF AND THAT

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:19.315
PLATFORM CANBE REPLICATED

USES- RECLAIMED WATER SO THIS

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.893
PROJECT WILL NOT NEED TO ACCESS

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.430
IN FRESH WATER SYSTEM IT HAS

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.466
THAT CAPABILITY THERE'S EXCESS

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:39.102

HI PLAN STILL HAVEN'T DEDICATED

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:40.516
SPACE THERE TO STUDY AND

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:44.287
EVALUATE. HI PLANS LABOR ISSUES

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.122
REGARDING WORKING WITH HYDROGEN.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.958
THE UC RIVERSIDE IS ONE OF OUR

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:49.892
PARTNERS IN THIS THEY'RE GONNA

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.394
HELP US WITH THE ADVANCEMENT OF

SCIENCE THE TECHNOLOGY

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:56.332
SURROUNDING THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:59.635
AND THE IMPACT ON THE EXISTING

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.503
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN THE

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:03.172
CONSULTING FIRM G. H. T. AND

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:04.707

WITH ESTABLISHING HYDROGEN HUBS

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.213
IN BOTH AUSTRALIA AND EUROPE.

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:12.815
HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.684
TRYING TO BUILD THIS OUT. SO THE

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.787
EXISTING FACILITIES OR ARE THERE

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:20.423

FEEDING INTO THIS PROJECT AND

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:37.940
BEING ABLE TO USE HYDROGEN GOING

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:42.278
FORWARD. SO WE THINK IT'S

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:44.580
IDEALLY. THERE'S A LOT ABOUT

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:47.483
HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.620
RIGHT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD- SOME

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:53.155
OF THE BENEFITS WE THINK. AS WE

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:55.391
MOVE FORWARD IS THAT WE CAN

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.660
UTILIZE AND IS JANICE POINTED

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.129
OUT IN REPURPOSE EXISTING

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.431
INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WOULD BE

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.900
THE LEAST COST MOST EFFICIENT

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.436
WAY FOR US TO GET TO THIS. LOW

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:10.706
CARBON ECONOMY AND WE THINK WE

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:13.909
CAN BE BACK QUICKLY AT OF A

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.244
FACILITY LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:16.746

COACHELLA VALLEY ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.181
FIFTY MILES EAST OF LA IS ON THE

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.918
CALL TODAY WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.020
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN ACTUALLY

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:02.491
REMINISCED ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:05.627
REYES PRESENTATION IS NOT MOVING

IS IT MOVING FOR YOU GUYS

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:10.332
BECAUSE IT'S NOT MOVING FOR ME-

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.534
WE SEE A PICTURE AND THAT'S YEAH

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:15.604
ENABLE BY. UP THERE WE GO CAN

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.073
YOU SEE IT CHANGING NOW YEAH. SO

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:19.474
THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY A

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.276
SOMEONE HAS A LONG HISTORY IN

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.344
ZERO MISSION WE WERE THE FIRST

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:24.346
TO TRANSITION TO CNG WE'VE BEEN

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.647
USING GASEOUS FUEL SINCE THAT

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.550
TIME THE FIRST TO- OPERATE

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:30.185
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL BUSES IN THE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:34.389
FIRST TO OPERATE DISPENSED AND

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:34.856
GENERATE HYDROGEN FOR

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.124
TRANSPORTATION. THIS IS A LITTLE

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:37.759
BIT ABOUT THE FREE RUN TODAY WE

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.227
HAVE TWENTY ONE FUEL CELL

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:42.097
ELECTRIC BUSES- ON THE PROPERTY

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.699
WE HAVE FIVE IN PRODUCTION WE

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.500
ALSO ARE TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC SO

01:16:45.567 --> 01:16:46.768
WE DO RUN BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.804
VEHICLES INVOLVED HEAVY DUTY BUS

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.940
AND IN OUR ON. A SUPPORT FLEET

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.442
AND WE JUST GOT ALERTED THAT WE

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.043
WANT TO EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.411
DOLLAR BUS AND BUS FACILITIES

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.880
GRANT FROM THE FDA FOR MORE

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.882
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND-

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.584
THE REHAB OF SOME OF OUR CNG

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.654
VEHICLES TO GET US THROUGH. THE

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.556
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION. SO

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:09.391
WHY ARE WE GOING TO FUEL CELL-

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.726
WE'RE GOING FUEL CELL BASED ON A

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.227
LOT OF THINGS ONE OF THE MOST

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.862
SIGNIFICANT IS THE REPLACEMENT

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:17.532
VEHICLES- CNG BUSES REPLACEMENT

01:17:17.599 --> 01:17:19.901
OF FUEL CELLS A ONE TO ONE

01:17:19.968 --> 01:17:20.802
REPLACEMENT. WE DO RUN BATTERY

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:22.671
ELECTRIC AS I MENTIONED AND THE

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.473
REPLACEMENT FOR THOSE VEHICLES

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:25.941
TO KEEP THE SAME ROUTE PROFILE

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:27.376
WE DO TODAY WOULD BE ABOUT ONE

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.244
POINT FIVE TO TWO BUSES. FOR

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:32.080
EVERY CNG BUS WE OPERATE TODAY

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.382
WE ALSO HAVE A CHALLENGING

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.183
CLIMENT INTO POVERTY OUT HERE IN

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:37.753
THE DESERT AND FIND IF YOU'LL SO

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.321
RELIABILITY. IS EXCELLENT AND

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:40.389
THEN IT ALSO MEETS THE

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.556
OPERATIONAL NEEDS WE DON'T

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.191
CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE FUELING

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:44.526
CLEANING AND PUTTING TO BED OF

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.528
OUR VEHICLES AT NIGHT WHEN WE

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.663
TRANSITION FROM COMPRESSED

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.298
NATURAL GAS TO HYDROGEN. YOU MAY

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:52.367
NOT KNOW BUT WE HAVE A FEW VERY

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.603
SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS- SO WHAT WE

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:56.471
BRING TO THE TABLE FOR

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:57.439
CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN HUB IS

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.408
ALREADY PRODUCTION FOR HYDROGEN

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.510
USED IN THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE. WE

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.311
DO OUT ELECTROLYZER RIGHT NOW

01:18:03.378 --> 01:18:04.880
THAT'S FOR YOU SEE NINE HUNDRED

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.348
KILOGRAMS FOR DAY. IT IS A

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.550
SCALABLE UNIT SO WE ALWAYS PLAN

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.385
ON SCALING IT UP FOR PRODUCTION

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:12.621
TO OFF TAKERS. WE'RE ALSO DOING

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.389
A PROJECT WITH NEIL AND HIS TEAM

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.024
AT SO CAL GAS THEY EACH TWO

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:17.626
SILVER STARS. WHICH WERE VERY

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.327
EXCITED ABOUT BASED ON THE

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.430
SCALABILITY THE SIZE AND THE

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:23.532
COST OF HYDROGEN. AND WE WERE

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:26.268
ALSO AWARDED A CDC GRANT TO

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.170
BUILD AID LIQUID STATION FOR

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:30.238
RESILIENCY FOR BOTH OUR FLEET.

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:31.740
AND FOR THE COACHELLA VALLEY FOR

01:18:31.807 --> 01:18:33.008
THEIR NEEDS FOR HYDROGEN WHETHER

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:36.445
IT BE FOR VEHICLE USE OR

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.480
ELECTRICITY. WE JUST PILOTED A

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:41.783
NEW TRAILER BY NICE AMERICA-

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:43.718
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER IN THE

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:45.120
STARTER SET FOR HYDROGEN FOR

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:47.489
FLEET OPERATORS. SOMEONE IS NOT

01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.857
ONLY INTERESTED IN HELPING

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:51.259
TRANSIT BUT ALSO FLEET OPERATORS

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:52.594
IN THEIR TRANSITION TO ZERO

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:53.895
EMISSION IN HYDROGEN AS A

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:56.164
CHOICE. AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.133
SMALL SCALE TRAILER THAT CAN BE

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.969
MOVED- IT CAN FUEL THREE HUNDRED

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.804
AND FIFTY BAR WHICH HEAVY DUTY

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:03.772
VEHICLES AND TRANSIT USE BUT IT

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.640
CAN ALSO AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.476
A PUMP FOR NINE HUNDRED- I'M

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:09.377
SORRY SEVEN HUNDRED BAR AND SO

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.146
IT COULD BE A DUAL STATION. ON

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:12.514
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.049
THIS PROVIDES TO THEM THE

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.151
HYDROGEN ECONOMY FOR BOTH EASE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.553
OF USE AND FOR SCALABILITY. AND

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.522
IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY SUNLINE IS

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:21.790
LOOKING TO PROCURE WANTED THESE

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:23.358
ARE UNITS TO PUT OUR INTO YOUR

01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.594
FACILITY SO WE CAN MAKE HYDROGEN

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:26.461
AVAILABLE TO THE EASTERN

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:27.829
COACHELLA VALLEY. AND THE

01:19:27.896 --> 01:19:31.032
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF THE

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:32.367
EASTERN REGION. WE HAVE SOME

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.735
FUTURE PLANS I SAY WE RENT

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:34.936
REMINISCED ABOUT THE FUTURE HERE

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:37.205
IT'S ONLINE- WE HAVE WITH THE

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:38.974
PROJECTS THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.509
WE WILL HAVE THREE TIMES FOR

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.644
HYDROGEN AVAILABLE PER DAY I'M

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:44.012
RIGHT NOW OUR FLEET DOESN'T

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.081
REQUIRE THAT. AMOUNT SO WE'RE

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:47.883
LOOKING TO SELL HYDROGEN WE'VE

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.784
BEEN SELLING CNG FOR TWENTY

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.586
EIGHT YEARS AND USE THAT REVENUE

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.088
TO PUT BACK INTO SERVICE TO OUR

01:19:53.155 --> 01:19:54.723
COMMUNITY. AND SO LOOKING FOR

01:19:54.789 --> 01:19:57.325
WAYS TO CREATE RESILIENCY WELL

01:19:57.392 --> 01:19:59.127
THAT ARE FUNDING STREAMS AND ONE

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.762
AT TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND OUR

01:20:00.829 --> 01:20:02.097
TRANSIT COMPONENT IS VERY

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:04.399
IMPORTANT TO US. I WE ALL ARE

ALSO LOOKING TO MAKE OUR

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.736
HYDROGEN COMPLETELY RENEWABLE

01:20:07.802 --> 01:20:09.938
THROUGH A SOLAR MICROGRID. I'M

01:20:10.005 --> 01:20:11.139
WE HAVE A PIECE OF PROPERTY

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.641
THAT'S KIND OF CHEATED THERE IN

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.442
THE AREA THAT WE ONLY NOW. AND

01:20:14.509 --> 01:20:16.011
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IN TALKS

TRUCK PLAZA ON THAT- PIECE OF

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.460
LAND. ON THIS WOULD BE FOR THE

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.329
HEAVY DUTY SECTOR TO USE- FOR AN

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.464
OPPORTUNITY FUEL IT. YOU'LL AS

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.333
THEY GET INTO THE LA BASIN AND

ON THE I. TEN CORRIDOR. THAT

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.087
WOULD MAKE EASE OF USE FOR THIS

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.956
STATION FOR TRUCKS MOVING DOWN.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.357

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.758
THINK THERE SHOULD BE A

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:06.060
CORNERSTONE FOR CALIFORNIA UP.

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:07.462
WHAT I OPERATE SECOND

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:09.197
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE LEVERAGE

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:11.799
THIS FEDERAL OPPORTUNITY- TO

01:26:11.866 --> 01:26:13.568
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRIVATE

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.236
SECTOR INVESTMENTS- THAT WE ARE

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:17.071
GOING TO BE IN HYDROGEN TO

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.339
CREATE A SELF SUSTAINING

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:21.709
HYDROGEN ECONOMY. I'M THE TYPE

01:26:21.776 --> 01:26:22.911
AND IN YOUR ADDRESS MANY EARLIER

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:25.079
HE NOTED THAT PUBLIC POLICY

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:27.415
SUPPORT THAT SORT OF LAUNCH OF

01:26:27.482 --> 01:26:29.183
HYDROGEN BY PRIVATE ACTORS WHAT

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.119
IS GOING TO SCALE BACK AND- THAT

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:32.520
WAS JUST A ROBUST YOU KNOW

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:33.988
AGREEMENT THAT CALIFORNIA HAD

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:36.424
DURING COALITION FOR THAT. POINT

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:37.525
YOU KNOW BETTER UNDERSCORED BY

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.360
THE FACT THAT THEIR RESOURCES

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:41.930
BOARD FINDS THAT 90% OF THE

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:44.499
HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK COSTS

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.134
ARE GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.370
PRIVATE SECTOR. AND SO IF WE CAN

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.438
ENCOURAGE THE STATE OF

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:52.240
CALIFORNIA TO FINISH THE LAUNCH

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:54.676
OF THE HYDROGEN FUELING NETWORK

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.311
THAT'LL PLAY VERY NICELY INTO

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.879

PHILADELPHIA AND ATHLETE

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.890
OPERATORS ARE NOT GOING TO

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.725
TRANSITION YOU FEEL HEALTHIER

COLDER HERE EMISSION VEHICLE

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:54.462
ALTERNATIVE. IF THE FUELING IS

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:57.665
UNAVAILABLE THAT IS- TROOPER

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.600

AN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRST- POLICY

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.089
. SHINNING OVER TO- CAL HYDROGEN

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:22.690
. IS THOROUGHLY CAN YOUR- AND

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.325
ZERO HIGH. BUT IN THE NEAR TERM

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.394
THINK WE HAVE TO REAL. ABOUT PER

01:29:26.461 --> 01:29:27.862
IN. SUPPLY OF HIGH THAT IS ALSO

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:30.131
AFFORDABLE YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.365
JUNCTURE LET'S NOT PRECLUDE

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:33.000
OTHER PRODUCTION PATHWAY THE

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:35.803
LET'S BUILD TOWARD WHAT WE WANT

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.370
IN THE FUTURE. DIGGING A BIT

01:29:36.437 --> 01:29:38.573
DEEPER ON PRODUCTION STARTING

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:41.109
WITH ELECTROLYTIC- YOU KNOW I

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.443
WON'T REPEAT THAT GOOD WORK THAT

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.912
THE SPEAKERS I HAD OFFERED. BUT

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.714
I DO BELIEVE THERE IS SOME

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:49.450
POLICY WORK THAT IS NEEDED BY

01:29:49.517 --> 01:29:51.686
THE LEGISLATURE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:54.322
COMMISSION AND TIGHT SO. AROUND

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:57.525
THE INDUSTRIAL RATE FOR-

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.627
RENEWABLE POWER WHICH IS GOING

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:01.329
TO BE CRITICAL TO SUPPORT

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.631
ELECTROLYTES HERS AND TO MAKE

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:04.132
THAT A COST COMPETITIVE

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.167
TECHNOLOGY. SO AGAIN

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.535
RECOMMENDING SOME POLICY

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.103
WORKAROUNDS CREATING WHOLESALE

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.105
RATE FOR ACCESS RENEWABLE POWER

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.807
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE ELECTROLYZER

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:14.509
ELECTROLYTES OR SUCH FOR COST

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:17.678
COMPETITIVE. I'M USING BIO MATHS

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:19.247
MAKE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN- THAT

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.149
WAS DISCUSSED BY SPEAKERS-

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.787
IS GOING TO POSITION DIFFERENT.

COOK- MY OWN TAKE IS THAT

01:34:30.798 --> 01:34:31.699
THERE'S A SYNERGISTIC

01:34:31.766 --> 01:34:32.666
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT DUTY

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.735
AND HEAVY- BUT BUT YOU KNOW HOW

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:36.303
TO THINK ABOUT THIS AND HOW TO

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:38.406
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.408
PAGE. AS IT RELATES TO BOTH OF

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:43.978
THESE PLATFORMS. I REQUEST THANK

BE WHILE LEVELS OF MANKIND AND

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.793
EACH THE VEHICLE CLOCK THERE I'M

01:34:58.859 --> 01:35:02.396
L. EIGHT AND WE WORK TOWARDS

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:04.565
SCALING UP THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:07.168
IN TOTAL WE NEED TO DEMAND

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:09.303
CREATED BY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.338
THOSE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES EVERY

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.041
SINGLE ONE OF THOSE MEDIUMS.

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:14.542
EVERYTHING ONE OF THOSE

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:17.078
PASSENGER VEHICLE IN ORDER TO

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:20.081
ALLOW HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCERS

01:35:20.147 --> 01:35:22.249
YOU MAKE LARGE INVESTMENTS IN

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.151
RENEWABLE I'M PRODUCTION

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.821
PATHWAYS AT AN AFFORDABLE COST

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:29.056
THAT BENEFITS EVERYBODY SO WE

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:32.159
EITHER GROW TOGETHER OR WE FALL

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:35.229
APART AND YOU KNOW I BELIEVE AND

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.831
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW FIRST

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:38.466
ANSWER WOULD OFFER AND THEN THE

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:43.404
SECOND. IS THAT I'D- THERE ARE

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:44.305
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION LIGHT DUTY

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.173
VEHICLE ON THE ROAD AND ABOUT

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.476
ONE MILLION HEAVY DUTY YOUR CALL

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:50.211
AND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.546
WITH A ROBOT. WITH ROBUST

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:55.082
SUPPORT FOR PASSENGER VEHICLE

01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:57.218
AND- LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER

01:35:57.284 --> 01:36:00.387
VEHICLES FOR TO SCALE IN

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:01.655
PRODUCING THOSE HEALTH AFTER

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.357
THOSE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE IS

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:05.025
TRANSFERABLE TO THE HEAVY DUTY

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:06.727
APPLICATIONS SO THE MORE THAT WE

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.529
CAN DO IN LIFE YOU NEED FOR OUR

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:11.332
COST REDUCTION IN THE- COMPONENT

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.134
PARTS OF THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCK.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:15.336
CONVERSELY YOU KNOW BLACK LIGHT

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:18.339
DUTY CAN BE A CALL ABOUT FIVE

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:20.875
KILOGRAMS WHEREAS EIGHT TRACK

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:23.644
HAD FIFTY KILOGRAM SO B. THE

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:26.447
MAN'S PROFILE AND THE HEAVY DUTY

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:28.349
TRUCKS AND HOW MUCH FUEL IS

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.784
GOING TO CONSUME. IS GOING TO

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:32.286
CREATE THAT SORT OF DEMAND IN

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:33.854
THE MARKET AND ENTERPRISES

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:36.257
PRODUCERS TO COMMENT WHICH DRIVE

01:36:36.323 --> 01:36:37.858
DOWN THE COSTS NOT JUST FOR THE

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.160
HEAVY DUTY COMMUNITY THAT THAT'S

01:36:39.226 --> 01:36:40.461
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.763
MAJOR COST REDUCTIONS FOR. THE

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.765
PASSENGER VEHICLE FLEET THERE'S

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:46.500
A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT

01:36:46.567 --> 01:36:49.904
EXISTS WITH DEVELOPING- WHEN WE

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.840
WANT TO REDUCE FUEL COSTS AND

01:36:52.907 --> 01:36:55.342
REDUCE COMPONENT PARTS THAT GO

01:36:55.409 --> 01:36:57.511
INTO VEHICLES. WHICH AND WE ALL

01:36:57.578 --> 01:36:59.747
KNOW IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:00.481
BARRIERS TO ADOPTION AND THE

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:02.750
HEAVY DUTY. SECTOR WE'VE GOT A

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:04.218
DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE YOUR

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:11.992
MISSION TRUCKS- IN EVERY. WAY

01:37:12.059 --> 01:37:13.494
THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:14.161
. I APPRECIATE LIKE LOVE TO HEAR

01:37:14.228 --> 01:37:15.930
FROM ANY OTHER PANELS SUSPICIOUS

01:37:15.996 --> 01:37:17.431
SOMEBODY HAS A- THAT A- VIEW OF

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:23.370
THIS. ANYONE IN THEIR PANELS

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:26.941
LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. THANK

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:29.476
YOU- I JUST WANTED TO BUILD ON

01:37:29.543 --> 01:37:32.546
WHAT THERESA SAID IN HER EARLIER

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.949
COMMENTS THAT- IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:37.117
THINK. ABOUT ADVANCING

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:39.720
TRANSPORTATION ALONGSIDE OTHER

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:42.489
APPLICATIONS- SHE MENTIONED IT

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:43.991
WAS FIVE KILOGRAMS FOR A

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:48.028
PASSENGER CAR. FIFTY KILOGRAMS-

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:50.164
TRUCK HEAVY DUTY TRUCK AND WE

01:37:50.231 --> 01:37:52.099
KNOW THAT THOSE TRUCKS ARE

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:54.501
REALLY BIG SOURCES OF POLLUTION

01:37:54.568 --> 01:37:56.804
CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. THE

01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:59.573
CHALLENGES AT THE END AND WE DID

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.208
EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH A LOT

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:03.911
OF OFF TAKERS- THROUGHOUT THE

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.980
PROCESS AND HIGH DEAL LA. WE

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:07.815
KNOW THAT THESE FLEET OPERATORS

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:10.384
JAHN'S ARE- IN TERMINAL

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.585
OPERATORS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:14.455
MOBILE HEAVY DUTY AT STATIONARY.

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:16.790
ANY AS WELL THEY WANT TO CONVERT

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:19.059
THEY WANT TO DECARBONISE AND

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.894
WHAT WE HEARD THEM SAY IS THAT

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:23.130
THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM. IT

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:24.598
WASN'T I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:26.333
TO SAY IT'S THE COST OF THE

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.302
TRUCK OR THE COST OF THE NEW

01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:30.070
FUEL CELL PLATFORM. BUT WHAT

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:32.239
THEY TOLD US IS THEY SAID NO

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:34.441
IT'S THAT'S NOT IT. THE NUMBER

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:35.709
ONE CHALLENGE IS THE COST OF THE

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:38.012
FUEL. IT'S NOT ONLY THE COST OF

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.813
THE FUEL BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.582
WE'RE GOING TO LIKE BY ENOUGH OF

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:44.351
IT. SO IT'S ACCESS AND IT'S COST

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:46.920
BECAUSE THOSE USERS HAVE TO MAKE

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.289
SURE THAT THE TOTAL COST OF

01:38:48.355 --> 01:38:51.492
OWNERSHIP MAKES SENSE FROM A

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:53.360
BUSINESS STANDPOINT. SO ON

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.062
THAT'S WHY IN THINKING ABOUT

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:58.966
ADVANCING R. HOBBS- WE RECOMMEND

01:38:59.033 --> 01:39:00.868
THAT WE START WITH THE LARGE.

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.369
BANKABLE OFF TAKERS YOU NEED

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:04.838
JUST A COUPLE. HAVE INSTABILITY

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:08.242
IN PLANNING FOR. A HIGH VOLUME

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:11.512
COMPETITIVE. REDUCTION MARKET

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.914
AND THEREFORE YOU GETS MUCH

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:16.450
EASIER ONCE YOUR VISIBILITY INTO

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.052
ONE LARGE DROPPED ANCHOR IN A IN

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:20.154
A IN A LARGER SUPPLY CONTRACT TO

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.690
ADAM AND OTHERS. AND IT WAS OUR

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:24.792
CONCLUSION- AFTER DOING ALL

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.960
THESE INTERVIEWS THAT THE

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:29.530
STATIONARY AND MOBILE DIESEL

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.732
USERS WILL CONVERT MUCH MORE

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.067
QUICKLY ONCE THEY HAVE

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:35.636
VISIBILITY INTO THOSE CONTRACTS

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.671
SO IN SOME WAYS IT FROM OUR

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.106
CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM CAN BE

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.742
SOLVED BY. STARTING WITH SOME OF

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.210
THE LARGER OFF TAKERS

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:44.645
CONTRACTING WITH THEM ADDING

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:47.247
OTHERS WE CAN TAKING ONE BIG

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:48.248
LEAP FORWARD TO PUT IN THE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:49.783
INFRASTRUCTURE TO GET TO LOWER

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.819
DELIVERY COSTS AND WHEN YOU CAN

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:52.953
GET THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL THAT'S

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:58.058
HEADS. AND NOT TIED. TO ANY WARS

01:39:58.125 --> 01:40:00.060
IN UKRAINE OR- YOU KNOW IT'S

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.161
MADE LOCALLY- THAT'S A REALLY

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:03.597
ATTRACTIVE VALUE PROPOSITION I

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:04.732
THINK HISTORY WILL JUST TAKE

01:40:04.798 --> 01:40:06.467
CARE OF ITSELF. AND I THINK THAT

01:40:06.533 --> 01:40:08.235
YOU KNOW YOUR POINT IS WELL

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:10.204
TAKEN SO IN IN A SIMILAR AND

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:11.271
THERE SEEMS TO BE. TENSION WITH

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.307
RESPECT TO COLORS OF HYDROGEN

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:15.976
RIGHT SHOULD YOU KNOW THE GREEN

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:18.345
NESS I THINK EVERYBODY BUT-

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:19.113
THERE'S NOBODY HERE DOESN'T

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.914
BELIEVE AT LEAST ASPIRATIONAL

01:40:20.981 --> 01:40:22.750
AND GETTING TO FULLY RECHARGING

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:25.018
BUT BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE. A

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:27.254
CONVERSATION GOING ON ABOUT WHAT

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:28.956
OUR TOLERANCE SHOULD BE WATER

01:40:29.022 --> 01:40:31.625
APPROACH SHOULD BE OVER TIME- AS

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.727
AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW THAT A

01:40:33.794 --> 01:40:35.896
WILLINGNESS TO MOVE THROUGH. A

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:37.765
PHASE WHERE WE ACCEPT AS A GIVEN

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:40.467
AGAIN I THANK- THAT YOU CAN'T BE

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:42.669
GREEN STARRED IN FACT THERE'S A

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:43.370
SORT OF AN INNOVATION PATHWAY

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.773
THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE. SO HOW

01:40:45.839 --> 01:40:47.674
TO THINK ABOUT THAT DELIBERATELY

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:50.277
AS AS IT RELATES TO- YOU KNOW

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:53.614
ALLOCATIONS AND PRIORITIES AND

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:56.950
POLICIES. MISATTRIBUTED ME I AM.

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:58.519
VERY DO I WHICH NOT CLEAR TO

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:01.922
THEM I'M JUST ASKING THE PANEL-

01:41:01.989 --> 01:41:03.924
GOOD IDEAS FROM ANYBODY. I JUST

01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:05.692
LIKE TO SAY THAT JUST BRIEFLY

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:08.962
THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO GREEN

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:11.131
. SOON NOW NOW THERE'S NOTHING

01:41:11.198 --> 01:41:14.768
HOLDING US BACK- AND WE HAVE

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.471
SEEN LARGE HURDLE. RATE AROUND

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:19.506
THE WORLD IN FACT I THINK THE

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:21.008
PROJECT LAUREN THAT YOU

01:41:21.074 --> 01:41:23.043
MENTIONED YOU'RE WORKING ON WITH

01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:25.512
SO CAL GAS IS ALREADY. PRODUCING

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:27.948
AT THREE DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:31.118
WHICH IS VERY EXCITING. BOB IT'S

01:41:31.185 --> 01:41:32.386
TERRY TERMINATE YOUR CAN

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:34.822

BACKGROUND NOISE COINCIDENTLY

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.625
HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER MEETING SO

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:40.694
I'M IN A FUEL CELL- HONDA AT THE

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.296
MOMENT DRIVING TO MY NEXT

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:44.598
MEETING AND- OF REALLY ENJOYING

01:41:44.665 --> 01:41:46.433
THIS CONVERSATION. UP YOU KNOW I

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.836
WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE PRODUCE

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.037
SOMETHING OVER THREE TRILLION

01:41:50.103 --> 01:41:51.505
CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN IN THIS

01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:53.674
COUNTRY EVERY YEAR I'LL FROM

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:54.942
MOSTLY NATURAL GAS STEAM

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:56.877
REFORMATION OF NATURAL GAS A

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.679
FOSSIL FUELS WHAT WE DO THAT

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:02.950
HYDROGEN UP. TO VOTE. MOSTLY IS

01:42:03.016 --> 01:42:05.118
USED FOR STRIPPING SULFUR FROM

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:06.119
PETROLEUM TO MAKE DIESEL AND

01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:07.788
GASOLINE INSTEAD OF SIMPLY

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:09.389
PUTTING IT INTO OUR VEHICLES. SO

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.225
THE TRUTH IS IF WE SIMPLY PUT IT

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:12.726
INTO OUR VEHICLES WE CUT OUT ALL

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:14.795
OF THE NEEDS OF THE OIL. AND ALL

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.063
OF THE POLLUTION AND OTHER

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:17.397
PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH IT EVEN

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:20.968
IF WE WERE STILL USING A FOSSIL

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.135
FUEL I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THAT

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:23.971
. SHE IS A FORMER CALIFORNIA VA

01:42:24.037 --> 01:42:27.174
SECRETARY. BUT BUT I HI I POINT

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:29.443
THAT OUT BECAUSE I THINK. THAT

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:32.045
THE- BIOGAS BIOMETHANE HAS

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:33.447
TRAFFIC POTENTIAL. AND THE

01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:34.681
IMPORTANT THING IS TO MEASURE

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:36.717
THE CARBON INTENSITY. BECAUSE

01:42:36.783 --> 01:42:38.285
YOU KNOW THE CARBON INTENSITY

01:42:38.352 --> 01:42:39.186
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:40.454
GETTING THE WATER LET'S SAY YOU

01:42:40.521 --> 01:42:42.823
ARE DOING ELECTROLYSIS WITH THE-

01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:45.559
SOLAR OR WIND POWER. BUT

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.027
DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT'S COMING

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.428
FROM AND WHERE THE WATER IS

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.663
COMING FROM THAT YOU'RE GETTING

01:42:49.730 --> 01:42:51.098
THE HYDROGEN FROM. THAT COULD

01:42:51.164 --> 01:42:52.332
HAVE A MUCH HIGHER CARBON

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:53.634
INTENSITY THAT IF YOU'RE TAKING.

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.202
LET'S SAY LANDFILL GAS WHICH IS

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:56.436
CURRENTLY BEING FLARED OR OR

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.705
EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

01:42:58.772 --> 01:42:59.873
TWENTY SIX TIMES MORE POTENT AS

01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.842
A HEAT TRAPPING GAS. THANCO

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:05.012
TWO. AND AND SO THE CARBON

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:07.881
INTENSITY SCORES REALLY WHAT WE

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.650
NEED TO BE FOCUSING. VERY THE

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:10.584
PRESSURE THAT'S ON THE LAST

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:13.921
QUESTION AND- THAT'LL BE TURNED

01:43:13.987 --> 01:43:15.956
BACK OVER MY CULTURE. AND BUNCH

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.124
OF FOLKS IN THEIR TESTIMONY DAY

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.392
EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:22.296
LEVERAGING- PUBLIC INVESTMENTS

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:23.764
TO. INSTIGATE AN EXPEDITED

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:26.166
PRIVATE INVESTMENT SO THAT BY

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:27.601
SWITCHING STUFF GOING ON AMONG

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:30.938
UTILITIES- ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.539
FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE PIPELINES

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:33.140
OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:36.043
USEFUL HYDROGEN. I DO I DO HAVE

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:38.378
A QUESTION FOR- THE- SOCALGAS

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:41.214
ROASTED IN THE IN DEATH AS SORT

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:42.950
OF BIG EXEMPLIFYING THESE.

01:43:43.016 --> 01:43:44.751
QUESTIONS YOU TALK ABOUT THE

01:43:44.818 --> 01:43:46.219
ANGELES LINK PROJECT THAT THEY

01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:48.188
CAN AND YOU KNOW THE QUESTION

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:50.691
THEN BECOMES IF IT'S A PRIVATE

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.559
INVESTMENT IS THIS GOING TO BE

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:55.128
BORNE BY SHAREHOLDERS OR BY RATE

01:43:55.195 --> 01:44:00.267
PAYERS- AS AS WE MOVE THESE

01:44:00.334 --> 01:44:01.568
THINGS FORWARD. THANK YOU

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:03.470
SENATOR NEWMAN FROM EURO AT THE

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:05.939
MOMENT ARE ANGELES LANG. EFFORT

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:08.508
IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO SCOPE THE

01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:11.778
PROJECT AND LOOK AT THE OFF

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:13.513
TAKERS AND SUPPLIERS AND-

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.148
CHARACTERIZE THE MARKET BY LET'S

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:18.085
SAY. EARLY ENGINEERING EFFORTS I

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:19.753
WILL SAYTHAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.655
WORKED VERY CLOSELY UN IDEAL

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:23.290
AWAY WITH JANICE AND HER TEAM

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:25.359
AND MANY OTHERS. WE KNOW THE

01:44:25.425 --> 01:44:30.063
MARKET EXIST TODAY- BUT OUR

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.598
EARLY EFFORT IS REALLY TO

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:32.532
CHARACTERIZE. WHAT PART OF OUR

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:35.068
OWN. HEAVY INDUSTRIAL

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:37.771
TRANSPORTATION. INDISPENSABLE

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:41.341
FUEL- COSTUMERS THOSE CUSTOMERS

01:44:41.408 --> 01:44:43.310
THAT EXIST OR ALREADY HAVE

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.879
EXISTING NATURAL GAS WITH. WHAT

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:46.480
CUSTOMERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:48.649
HYDROGEN. AND ONCE WE'VE DONE

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.150
THAT ONCE WE JUST DON'T FOR

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:52.586
MARKET THEN I THINK YOU KNOW IT

01:44:52.653 --> 01:44:54.988
BE TIME TO START WITH THE

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:57.057
HOSPITALIZATION WORLD LEADERS OF

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:59.326
THE COST OF THAT WE DO THINK

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:00.360
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:03.263
GOOD. IN THE UTILITIES OF

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:05.966
PROVIDING A BROAD ACCESS TO

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:08.602
HYDROGEN- THAT IS SOMETHING

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:10.203
THAT'S REALLY BEING UNDERTAKEN

01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:13.840
IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE. AT HALF

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.942
PACE. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE AT

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:19.613
LEAST IN SOME PART. AS AAS A

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.781
RESULT OF THE CONFLICT IN

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:24.084
UKRAINE- THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:26.720
DOUBLED DOWN ON ITS EFFORTS TO

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:27.954
BECOME INDEPENDENT OR FROM

01:45:28.021 --> 01:45:30.257
RUSSIA. IN TWO WAYS ONE BY

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:33.193
ACCELERATING. THE ACCESS TO

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.095
AMERICAN LIQUID OF LIQUEFIED

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.863
NATURAL GAS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:38.565
FOR THIS CONVERSATION. BUT

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:40.100
REALLY SIGNIFICANTLY MAKING

01:45:40.167 --> 01:45:42.035
COMMITMENTS GREEN HYDROGEN AND

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:43.870
THAT GREEN HYDROGEN IT WILL

01:45:43.937 --> 01:45:47.474
LARGELY BE- MOVED THROUGHOUT

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:50.377
EUROPE IN THE- LARGE SCALE

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:53.080
TRANSMISSION. HE IS- OPERATORS

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:55.215
THOSE ADDITIONAL UTILITY TYPE

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.917
OPERATORS THAT MOVE GAS ON

01:45:56.983 --> 01:45:59.453
BEHALF OF COST SO WE SEE A THE

01:45:59.519 --> 01:46:01.922
CUSTOMER CLASS IT WILL BE.

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:04.491
DISTINCTLY BENEFIT SPECIFICALLY

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:06.793
THOSE THAT ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.662
IN ELDERLY I THINK IT'LL BE A

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.530
CONVERSATION LEGISLATORS AND-

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:14.267
AND REGULATORS AS THE HOMES. I

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:15.502
APPRECIATE DAVIS YOU HAVE DONE

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:17.804
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- SENATOR

01:46:17.871 --> 01:46:20.340
BEN ALLEN YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.442
FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS. WELL I

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:24.077
JUST APPRECIATE ALL THESE GREAT

01:46:24.144 --> 01:46:25.278
PRESENTATIONS I'VE EVER OF

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:26.913
CERTAINLY LEARNED A LOT AND- IT

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.882
DID YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S A

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:30.317
THERE'S SO MUCH WORK UNDER WAY I

01:46:30.383 --> 01:46:32.285
GUESS- I WOULD LOVE SOME

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:35.489
INSIGHTS. MAYBE FROM KOBE IS- AS

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:37.858
WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR-

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.659
APPLICATION AND WE GOT YOU KNOW

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:40.761
HOW PROPOSALS FOR NORTHERN

01:46:40.827 --> 01:46:41.428
CALIFORNIA FROM SOUTHERN

01:46:41.495 --> 01:46:43.296
CALIFORNIA BOTH VERY WORTHY HOW

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:45.065
DO WE FIGURE OUT THE GEOGRAPHIC

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:48.101
BALANCE- AS WE AS WE APPROACH

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:50.203
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN OUR

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:52.973
APPLICATIONS. THAT'S A GREAT

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:54.941
QUESTION CENTER ALLEN AND THAT'S

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:56.243
WHAT WE WERE FOCUSING ON THESE

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:58.245
COMING MONTHS WE HAD YOU KNOW WE

01:46:58.311 --> 01:47:00.113
HAVE TO SEE OTHER R. F. P. THE

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.581
FELLOW WHAT SHAPE THAT TAKES. I

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:03.183
THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT YOU

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:05.652
KNOW IS A LOT OF GEOGRAPHIC

01:47:05.719 --> 01:47:06.286
STRENGTHENED WE TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.555
OF THERE'S A LOT OFWORK IN LOS

01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:09.222
ANGELES THAT UNIT GREAT IDEA OF

01:47:09.289 --> 01:47:11.291
THE PROJECT AND IN LODI. AND SO

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:13.026
I THINK THE WAY I WOULD THINK

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:15.328
ABOUT IT IS- FIRST WE HAVE TO

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:16.963
FIGURE HOW MUCH MONEY THERE IS

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:18.799
AND THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT IN

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:19.666
TERMS OF FACING RIGHT SO LIKE

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:21.301
WHERE IS THAT FIRST INVESTMENTS

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.303
YEAH WE DO ALL OF IT AT ONCE IS

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.272
IT MAKES SENSE TO INVEST IN ONE

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:26.606
REGION FIRST. AND THEN PHASE AND

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:28.408
THE SECOND REGION'S THOSE THESE

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:29.543
ARE OPEN QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.444
TO WORK THROUGH. I THINK WE WANT

01:47:31.511 --> 01:47:32.679
TO MAKE SURE IS WE DON'T DILUTES

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.281
THE FEDERAL RESOURCES AND STATE

01:47:34.347 --> 01:47:35.148
RESOURCES SUCH A WAIVER

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:37.083
ULTIMATELY. NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT I

01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:38.451
BUT THE IMPORTANT PART IS MAKING

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:40.320
SURE THAT ULTIMATE PAN IS

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:41.788
BRINGING THIS STATEWIDE SO FOR

01:47:41.855 --> 01:47:43.490
WORK WHERE IT STARTS AND

01:47:43.557 --> 01:47:44.391
FINISHES YOU KNOW YOU COULD SEE

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.726
IT SO. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE

01:47:46.793 --> 01:47:48.395
RESOURCES BUT I MEAN I COULD SEE

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:50.463
A CASE WHERE WE'RE DOING A BUNCH

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:52.132
OF PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.934
ONCE THERE'S ALSO POTENTIAL TO

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.036
START IN A REGION WITH A CLEAR

01:47:56.102 --> 01:47:56.970
PLAN TO EXPAND INTO OTHER

01:47:57.037 --> 01:47:59.372
REGIONS. SO I KNOW IT'S NOT A

01:47:59.439 --> 01:48:00.540
COMPLETE ANSWER AT THIS POINT

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:02.075
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:02.776
QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKING

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:04.811
OURSELVES AND WANT TO WORK WITH

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.946
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:07.347
SURE. THAT WE COME TO A

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:08.615
CONSENSUS ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:09.616
MOST SENSE AND VISIT THIS AND

01:48:09.683 --> 01:48:11.284
AFTER THE STATE BUT ALSO THE

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.352
NATIONAL MARKET TO SUCCEED. AND

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.154
TYSON WHAT SO WHAT DO YOU KNOW

01:48:14.221 --> 01:48:16.022
ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:19.626
HAPPENING IN- IN OTHER REGIONS

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.895
RIGHT NOW NO I WE HAD A

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:22.629
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:29.369
REGIONS AS PRESENTED BY THE- THE

01:48:29.436 --> 01:48:30.270
FEDERAL FOLKS BUT- ARE THEY ARE.

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.405
LOOKING TO DO MORE. STATE CO.

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:34.107
ALL OR- YEAH YEAH. LOVE TO HEAR

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:36.243
ABOUT THAT WE ARE INSTANTLY IN.

01:48:36.309 --> 01:48:38.278
AN ADULT. AND MANY OTHERS HAVE I

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:40.413
MEAN I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF ALL

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.681
OF THEM. I THINK JUST LAST.

01:48:41.748 --> 01:48:43.116
YESTERDAY MAYBE NEW YORK

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.551
ANNOUNCED THE CONSORTIUM IN THE

01:48:44.618 --> 01:48:45.418
NORTHEAST THEN THERE'S THAT

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:46.186
THERE'S AN- INNATE. THE

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.054
INTERMOUNTAIN. AND THERE'S LIKE

01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:49.956
THE TEXAS LOUISIANA POTENTIALLY

01:48:50.023 --> 01:48:55.562
NORTHWEST- AND I THINK. SO YES

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:57.397
THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF- WE

01:48:57.464 --> 01:48:58.565
NEED TO GATHER RESOURCES I THINK

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.600
EVERYBODY IN FROM WHAT I'VE

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:01.601
GATHERED IN OVERLOOKING THE

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:03.403
CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN. AND

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:05.438
UNIQUE ENTITY BUT THAT BEING

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:07.540
SAID I THINK IF IT STRENGTHENS

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:09.009
OUR APPLICATION BRINGING AND

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:10.343
OTHER REGIONAL PARTNERS EITHER

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:11.878
DIRECTLY WITHIN THE APPLICATION

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.980
OR WE PLAN TO GET THERE KIND OF

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:15.615
SIMILAR TO THINKING ABOUT THE

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:16.650
REGION'S. HIS GRADES WERE

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:17.517
ACTIVELY PURSUING THOSE

01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:19.386
CONVERSATIONS AS WELL YOU KNOW

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.321
WITH THE SOUTH WEST OF THE

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.156
NORTHWEST- OF COURSE UNIT IN THE

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:23.757
ATTIC THREE HUNDRED COLLISION

01:49:23.823 --> 01:49:24.557
PRESENTATION STUDY PORTENTS OF

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:26.259
THE CONNECTION TO UTAH YOU KNOW

01:49:26.326 --> 01:49:30.263
SO. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:31.731
CONNECTED THIS. OFFICE RATHER.

01:49:31.798 --> 01:49:33.199
OR FRACKING OF LOS ALAMOS NINE.

01:49:33.266 --> 01:49:35.402
MONTH OKAY IT IS TAKES A LITTLE

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.304
ASKEW ALSO ON WHERE WE'RE HOW DO

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:41.141
YOU ANSWER I'VE- THE CONCERNS

01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:44.311
OUT THERE THAT- YOU KNOW.

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:45.946
ELECTROLYSIS STIRRED DERIVE

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:47.914
GREEN HYDROGEN IS GREAT AND

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:49.883
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A VISION THERE

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:51.484
FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE USE OF

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:54.321
ACCESS ELECTRICITY- USED TO DO

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:56.256
THAT BUT- BUT THAT BUT THAT IN

01:49:56.323 --> 01:50:00.126
THE END OF THE DAY- OF REALLY A

01:50:00.193 --> 01:50:02.128
SHARP PIVOT TOWARD HYDROGEN.

01:50:02.195 --> 01:50:04.264
WILL MESSAGE WILL NECESSITATE A

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:06.566
DOUBLING DOWN ON NATURAL GAS AND

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:07.901
OTHER FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:07.968 --> 01:50:10.236
FOR A LONG TIME TO GET TO THAT

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:12.572
GREEN HYDROGEN VISION. THAT'S

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:15.575
PROBLEMATIC WHERE WHERE WHERE DO

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.310
YOU WHERE DO YOU. HOW DO YOU HOW

01:50:17.377 --> 01:50:20.180
DO YOU- YOU KNOW. EVALUATE THAT

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:23.683
THAT TENSION. IT'S A GREAT

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:25.085
QUESTION  THINK EVEN LOOKING AT

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.553
GENESIS LIED ABOUT THE

01:50:26.619 --> 01:50:28.121
PROJECTIONS FOR THE COST OF

01:50:28.188 --> 01:50:29.856
HYDROGEN AND GREEN HEIDI

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:31.424
ALTERNATELY GREEN HYDROGEN IS

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:32.525
GOING TO OUTCOMPETE FOSSIL

01:50:32.592 --> 01:50:34.627
SOURCES AND SO FROM THE STATE

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:36.296
PERSPECTIVES YOU KNOW WE'RE WE

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.931
WOULD LIKE TO PRIORITIZE

01:50:37.998 --> 01:50:39.332
INVESTING IN GREEN HYDROGEN ON

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.967
THE BROAD DEFINITION I THINK YES

01:50:41.034 --> 01:50:42.602
THIS IS A REALLY GOD ONE. AND

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:43.937
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:46.139
INDUSTRY CAN'T INVEST IN FOSSIL

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:47.307
BASED PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW IF

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:49.409
THEY WILL OR THEY WON'T IT'S ALL

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:50.877
PART OF THE SYSTEM BUT WHAT

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:52.245
WE'RE TRYING TO ENABLE IS THE

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:53.847
RENEWABLE GREEN HYDROGEN AND

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:54.814
ULTIMATELY THE ECONOMICS AND

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.549
ABOUT. THE REALLY CUTS BACK IN

01:50:56.616 --> 01:50:58.718
AND IT HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF

01:50:58.785 --> 01:50:59.986
POTENTIALLY INCREASING THE

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.654
PENETRATION IN ECONOMICS OF

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.656
SOLAR AND WIND AS YOU CAN YEAH

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:05.558
AFTER A LOT MORE CAPACITIES

01:51:05.625 --> 01:51:06.526
REFER ANY PREVIOUS VIRTUOUS

01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:09.662
CYCLE OF YOU KNOW- DOWNWARD

01:51:09.729 --> 01:51:13.800
PRESSURE ON PRICES. AND ALL

01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:15.402
THREE OF THOSE SECTORS. YEAH I'M

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:17.804
IT WAS IS THE CONVERSATION LIKE

01:51:17.871 --> 01:51:20.140
BETWEEN GO BIZ AND THE AIR BOARD

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:25.211
ON THESE. THE PHILOSOPHICAL. YES

01:51:25.278 --> 01:51:27.380
G. SOURCING CONVERSATION. VERY

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.282
CLOSELY ALIGNED SO WE ARE REALLY

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:30.283
LOOKING TO THE AIRPORT FOR THEIR

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:31.818
LEADERSHIP LIKE THREE DYSTOPIAN

01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:33.586
PLAN YOU KNOW BASED ON THEIR

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:35.989
FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS HOW DO WE

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:37.924
GET TO WORK TWENTY FORTY FIVE

01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:39.793
ALITY CARTER AND THAT'S THE BASE

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:41.895
AT THE TABLE THAT WE'RE TRYING

01:51:41.961 --> 01:51:42.562
TO ORGANIZE AROUND THAT IF THAT

01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:44.297
MAKES SENSE AND SO YOU KNOW

01:51:44.364 --> 01:51:45.565
THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:47.700
YOU KNOW HOW BIG OF A ROLE. I DO

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.035
ANYTHING WILL PLAY REALLY

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.470
FRANKLY AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:51.938
MAKE SURE THAT HYDROGEN IS

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.573
POSITION TO PLAY ITS BEST ROLE

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:58.812
AND EXPAND THEM PROBABLY ENOUGH

01:51:58.878 --> 01:51:59.813
REFORMS EVEN WATER PROJECTIONS

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:04.684
ARE. SO IT WAS VERY CLOSE

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:07.520
PARTNERSHIP AND ALIGNMENT YEAH.

01:52:07.587 --> 01:52:10.824
I'M OKAY I LOOK FOR IS ALL THANK

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.225
YOU. FOR THE PRESENTATION I'M

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:14.294
I'M STILL WANT TO GET DOWN THE

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:16.429
AISLE TO SEE- YOU KNOW WITH

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:17.430
WOULD LOVE TO GO CHECK IT ALL

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:19.732
OUT- WELCOME ANYTIME YEAH I KNOW

01:52:19.799 --> 01:52:21.668
IT'S FIGURE THAT OUT I THAT.

01:52:21.734 --> 01:52:25.805
EVEN YEAH. VERY COOL I'M SO DID

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:30.410
YOU WHERE WHERE IT SO OUR

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:32.812
HYDROGEN JUST ONE PART OF YOUR

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:35.248
OF YOUR PROJECT RIGHT THERE'S IT

01:52:35.315 --> 01:52:39.119
COMMITTED TO. THERE ARE YOU GUYS

01:52:39.185 --> 01:52:40.120
WORKING ON AN ELECTRIFICATION

01:52:40.186 --> 01:52:43.523
ISSUES TO. SO OUR PRIMARY

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:45.558
FUNCTION AND THE WAY THAT THE

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:47.393
NONPROFIT WAS SET UP. FOR

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.696
DEVELOPING GAVE US OF THE ACCESS

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:51.898
TO THIS PROPERTY WAS BECAUSE OF

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:54.934
WORKING IN THE BLUE ECONOMY AND-

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:57.003
SO THAT'S- RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:58.538
OFFSHORE THINGS LIKE WAVE

01:52:58.605 --> 01:52:59.839
ENERGY- WE'VE GOT SOME

01:52:59.906 --> 01:53:01.274
INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:03.443
GETTING READY TO DEMONSTRATE- OF

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:04.978
COURSE OFFSHORE WIND BUT THE

01:53:05.044 --> 01:53:06.913
WAYS TO DO THAT THAT ARE. LESS

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.515
IMPACTFUL TO THE ENVIRONMENT-

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.250
THERMOCLINE CAPTURING THAT THE

01:53:10.316 --> 01:53:11.885
DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE AND

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.753
CENTROSAURUS ALL KINDS OF

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:15.989
RENEWABLE ENERGY THEIR OF SECOND

01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:18.091
CLUSTER FOCUS FOR US IS-

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:20.527
AQUACULTURE AND THAT INCLUDES

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:23.196
GROWING GIANT KELP AQUA FARMS AS

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.664
WELL AS ATLANTA AFTER BE TURNED

01:53:24.731 --> 01:53:26.933
INTO BIO FUELS AND- AND SOURCES

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.035
OF ENERGY AND EVEN TURNED INTO-

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:31.571
INTO HYDROGEN. AS WELL AS FOOD

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.673
AND PHARMACEUTICALS AND THEN OUR

01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:35.708
THIRD ONE IS IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH

01:53:35.775 --> 01:53:38.111
AS UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AND STUFF

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:40.013
THE WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING OUR

01:53:40.079 --> 01:53:42.015
OUR PLANET BETTER SO IT'S ALL

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:43.850
VERY INTER RELATED ASKED US

01:53:43.917 --> 01:53:45.885
CERTAINLY AS WE PUT OUR OWN

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:47.153
THREE POINT TWO MEGAWATTS OF

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:48.421
SOLAR WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:51.024
INSTALLED ON A ROOFTOP. I LOVE

01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:51.591
TO POWER SEVEN HUNDRED HOMES

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:53.126
MUCH MORE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:53:53.193 --> 01:53:54.827
USE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:56.362
TO BE THAT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:58.331
GREEN ENERGY THAT WILL BE USED

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:00.133
FOR MAKING HYDROGEN. CRIMES

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.202
AREN'T OKAY THANK YOU VEGETARIAN

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:07.941
IN MY FILE QUESTIONS. FOR RANDY

OF TIME AT THE BEGINNING A

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.418
PRESENTATION TALK ABOUT OAKLAND

01:54:18.484 --> 01:54:19.752
. YEAH WELL I JUST DECIDED

01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:22.455

SORRY. SO OFTEN OCCURRED IS

01:54:33.766 --> 01:54:35.568
MEANING THAT THEY COULD UTILIZE

01:54:35.635 --> 01:54:38.605
THE HYDROGEN FUEL. FOR SHIPPING

01:54:38.671 --> 01:54:40.840
FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES DOWN

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:42.575
AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND AIRPORT

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:43.710
IN OAKLAND THOSE ARE OUR

TO CURTAIL SOME OF THAT ENERGY

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:06.032
RIGHT WE DON'T NEED IT. YEAH FOR

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.501
OUR PROJECT- WE'RE PROPOSING TO

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:11.471
USE THE ACCESS. ENERGY RENEWABLE

01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:13.139
ENERGY WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE TO

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:15.475
PRODUCE HYDROGEN STORED AND THEN

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:21.714
COMBUSTED A WIN WIN SUN. ISN'T

01:56:23.142 --> 01:56:24.277
THREE THAT WE WILL NOT ONLY

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:25.445
PROMOTE AND OPERATE ZERO MISSION

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.180
BUT WILL TEACH OTHERS HOW TO DO

01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:29.649
IT. AND SO IT IS ACTUALLY PART

01:56:29.716 --> 01:56:30.283
OF OUR BOARD POLICY TO GO OUT

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:31.784
AND HELP OTHER TRANSIT OPERATORS

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:33.119
AND WE'RE EXPANDING THAT TO

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.587
THREE OPERATORS ON THE PRIVATE

01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:36.389
SIDE. ON HOW OUR BLUEPRINT CAN

01:56:36.456 --> 01:56:38.124
WORK FOR ANYONE AND MAYBE NOT

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:39.959
EXACTLY A SUNLINE IS PLANNED IT

01:56:40.026 --> 01:56:41.661
AND PUT IT OUT BUT PIECES AND

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.429
PARTS OF OUR BLUEPRINT COULD BE

01:56:43.496 --> 01:56:44.697
REAP REPLICATED ALL OVER

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:46.299
CALIFORNIA AND ALL OVER THE

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:48.835
COUNTRY FOR THAT MATTER. SO BY

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.670
THESE PUBLIC. PUBLIC FUNDING

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:53.039
SOURCES. PROVIDING NOT ONLY TO

01:56:53.106 --> 01:56:55.041
THE TRANSIT RIDER THROUGH THESE

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:56.743
INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO HOW WE CAN

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:58.211
MOVE THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY TO

01:56:58.277 --> 01:57:00.279
PRIVATE OPERATORS. IS REALLY HOW

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:02.248
WE SEE THIS WORKING AND BACK TO

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:03.816
SENATOR NEWMAN'S QUESTION. YOU

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.418
KNOW ABOUT LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:07.286
DUTY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PLAN

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:08.554
FOR SCALING OUR STATION WOULD

01:57:08.621 --> 01:57:11.124
ALLOW BOTH. PROVIDERS TO FUEL

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.625
FOR BOTH TYPES OF VEHICLE TYPES

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:14.594
TO PREVENT TO FUEL BUT AS WE SAW

01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:16.262
IT WAS WE SEE TRACKING POLL OUT

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:17.463
MORE AND MORE TRUCKS ON THE

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.265
ROAD. THIS HEAVY DUTY STATION

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:20.733
WOULD BE THE NEXT ITERATION OF

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.368
WHAT WE WOULD PROVIDE TO THE

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:23.369
PUBLIC. SO WE CAN TAKE THESE

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:25.338
PUBLIC INVESTMENTS HE'S PUBLIC

01:57:25.405 --> 01:57:27.106
FUNDING INVESTMENTS. AND TURN

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:28.841
THEM INTO NOT ONLY HOPING A

01:57:28.908 --> 01:57:30.977
PUBLIC OPERATOR. BUT THE PRIVATE

01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.412
ECONOMY MOVE FORWARD WE'RE

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:35.415
REALLY LEVERAGING THE FUNDING TO

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.049
THE BEST OF ITS ABILITY IN MY

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.684
OPINION. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WHEN

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:39.519
YOU MENTIONED THE FUELING

01:57:39.585 --> 01:57:40.720
STATIONS. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE ALSO

01:57:40.787 --> 01:57:41.821
HEARD. THAT WE NEED THE

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:42.922
INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:45.191
INFRASTRUCTURE SO. DESPERATELY

01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:47.693
NEEDED. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:48.694
LOOKING FOR THOUSAND FUELING

01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:50.930
STATION. DOWN THE ROAD UNTIL

01:57:50.997 --> 01:57:52.865
THEN- I THINK YOUR YOUR

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:55.301
PRESENTATION ON YOUR MOBILE

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:57.804
FUELING STATION WILL CALL IT-

01:57:57.870 --> 01:58:00.106
CAN GO HADN'T. AUGMENT THAT

01:58:00.173 --> 01:58:02.041
UNTIL WE ACTUALLY DO THE

01:58:02.108 --> 01:58:03.843
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:05.511
CHAU AE I'M POINTING THAT OUT

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.313
BECAUSEI THINK THAT WHETHER BE

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.681
THE BUS LINES OR EVEN PRIVATE

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.550
CITIZENS WERE BUYING THE FUEL

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:12.552
CELL HYDROGEN CARS. WE LOOK

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.854
FORWARD TO MOBILE FEW STATIONS

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:16.656
UNTIL WE ACTUALLY BUILT THE

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:19.158
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I'D LIKE TO

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:22.161
TELL. TURN MY ATTENTION OVER TO-

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:26.599
MR- TO OUR GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- IN

01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:27.867
I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOVERNOR

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:30.603

THAT YOU'RE WITH US IN SOME OF

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:36.943
THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:38.811
RECENTLY IN THE NEWS IS OF

01:58:38.878 --> 01:58:40.947
COURSE THE- THE SHIPS ARE ROUTED

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:44.484
SHORT. THE THE FREIGHT NOT

01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:46.552
GETTING INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.454
AND THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE

01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:49.322
STATE AND HOW TO HOW DO YOU

01:58:49.388 --> 01:58:51.691
FORESEE HYDROGEN. COMING TO THAT

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:54.293
AREA- OF THE COASTLINE AND HOW

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:57.330
IT WILL PLAY OUT IN IN THE

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:59.465
FUTURE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:00.700
THAT EUROPE YOUR LETTER THAT'S

01:59:00.766 --> 01:59:02.502
IT THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY THE

01:59:02.568 --> 01:59:03.402
POOR THINGS A LOT OF OUR

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:04.737
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES IN

01:59:04.804 --> 01:59:06.706
CALIFORNIA YOU MAY PICK OF THE

01:59:06.772 --> 01:59:07.440
PORT OF LA LOS ANGELES THINK

01:59:07.507 --> 01:59:09.542
IT'S LIKE. 40% OF OUR CARGO

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:12.278
CAPACITY I MEAN FOR REAL I MIGHT

01:59:12.345 --> 01:59:13.746
HAVE THE NUMBERS WRONGLY AT THE

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.381
PORT OF OAKLAND IN STOCK IN IT.

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:16.582
WHEN YOU SEE ALL THOSE OTHER

01:59:16.649 --> 01:59:18.584
THINGS WE HAVE TO ACT IN A

01:59:18.651 --> 01:59:19.852
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT COMING

01:59:19.919 --> 01:59:20.586
IN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:22.355
STATE OF JAPAN FOR EXAMPLE IS A

01:59:22.421 --> 01:59:24.090
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN YOU SHOW UP

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:25.358
THE BOARDS THAT STARTED A LECTOR

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:27.393
FIND I DO CHEN. A BUNCH OF THE

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:28.027
DIFFERENT SUPPORT APPOINTMENTS

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:30.963
SO I THINK TO ME THAT'S THAT'S

01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:32.031
THE HUGE. HYDROGEN PROVIDES YOU

01:59:32.098 --> 01:59:34.000
THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPTIMIZE OUR

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:36.235
PORT OPERATIONS DID YOU KNOW

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:38.404
CLEAN THEM UP AND NOT COMPROMISE

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:41.707
ON ANY. OF REPORT AND SO MAYBE

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:43.342
I'D KICK IT OVER TO T. REDUCE IT

01:59:43.409 --> 01:59:45.278
YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE C. RIGHT

01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:49.282
THERE AFTER THAT. BEFORE IT. THE

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:50.383
NAME HE WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:53.019
AFTER. OR SHOULD. ADVANTAGE

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:54.287
ABSOLUTELY TYSON AND- NEW WAYS

01:59:54.353 --> 01:59:55.721
OF. DELIVERING GREEN HYDROGEN

01:59:55.788 --> 01:59:57.490
INTO THE STATE BECAUSE- IT WE

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:59.158
ARE GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME TO

01:59:59.225 --> 02:00:00.726
RAMP UP OUR OUR IN STATE

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:02.194
PRODUCTION SO. I KNOW THERE'S

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:03.796
COMPANIES TODAY LOOKING AT-

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:05.498
CREATING GREEN HYDROGEN IN

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:07.533
AUSTRALIA IN SOUTH AMERICA

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.770
MEXICO AND- EVEN SAUDI ARABIA-

02:00:10.836 --> 02:00:13.105
WITH SOLAR AND WIND. AND DUST

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:15.374
SEA WATER OR- WASTE WATER. AND

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:17.443
THEN TAKING THAT GREEN HYDROGEN

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:18.744
TURNING IT INTO AMMONIA TO MAKE

02:00:18.811 --> 02:00:21.113
IT EASIER TO TRANSPORT- AMMONIA

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.315
CAN BE USED DIRECTLY AS A FUEL

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:24.283
IN SHIPS TODAY BUT SOME

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:26.052
MODIFICATIONS OF COURSE BUT- AS

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:27.987
A CLEANER FUEL AND THEN BRINGING

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.622
THAT AMONG YOU HERE. RIGHT NOW.

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:30.890
THERE'S AN AMMONIA PLANT AN

02:00:30.957 --> 02:00:32.291
AMMONIA TERMINAL IN THE PORT OF

02:00:32.358 --> 02:00:34.994
STOCKTON THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR

02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:36.963
QUITE SOME TIME- THAT'S CAN BE.

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:38.397
A SOURCE OF INCOMING GREEN

02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:39.699
HYDROGEN IN THAT FORM AND THEN

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:41.133
OF COURSE YOU JUST TURN THE

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.835
AMMONIA BACK INTO HYDROGEN WHEN

02:00:42.902 --> 02:00:44.403
IT GETS HERE. AND I KNOW THAT

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:45.905
THERE'S EFFORTS BY PRIVATE

02:00:45.972 --> 02:00:47.773
INVESTORS LOOKING TO BRING MORE

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.675
OF THAT INTO THE STATE. BECAUSE

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:51.143
I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:52.778
THAT A TYPICAL CAR LIKE THE ONE

02:00:52.845 --> 02:00:57.183
I'M DRIVING IT NOW TAKES. FIVE

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.484
KILOGRAMS A TRUCK FIFTY. WE'RE

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:00.553
BRINGING IN A- FIVE HOUSE. ARE

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.888
HARBOR- TOUR VESSEL FROM SEATTLE

02:01:02.955 --> 02:01:03.856
THAT'S JUST BEEN COAST GUARD

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.658
CERTIFIED THAT USES TWO HUNDRED

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:08.127
AND FIFTY KILOGRAMS. AND THAT'S

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:09.362
JUST A SEVENTY FIVE PASSENGER

02:01:09.428 --> 02:01:11.697
VESSEL OBVIOUSLY LARGER SHIPS-

02:01:11.764 --> 02:01:13.799
WILL USE FAST QUANTITIES MORE

02:01:13.866 --> 02:01:15.368
WHETHER THAT'S AN ART FORM OF

02:01:15.434 --> 02:01:17.470
GASEOUS HYDROGEN OR LIQUID

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:18.704
HYDROGEN WHICH CONTAINS EVEN

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:21.540
MORE ENERGY DENSITY. UP BUT- BUT

02:01:21.607 --> 02:01:22.675
THAT'S THE POTENTIAL FOR

02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:25.211
CREATING. JOBS CERTAINLY WE WANT

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:27.046
TO PRODUCE AS MUCH AS WE CAN

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:28.547
HERE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS

02:01:28.614 --> 02:01:30.549
TO COME WITH THAT SORT OF FOR

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:32.818
TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:34.620
THROUGH THE COURTS. THANK YOU

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:36.656
FOR MENTIONING THAT JOBS AND WE

02:01:36.722 --> 02:01:37.823
KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGY THE

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:40.026
SKILL WILL BE NEEDED THAT IS A

02:01:40.092 --> 02:01:41.560
NEW TRANSITION FOR THE LABOR

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:44.764
FORCE. AND I KNOW I KNOW- THE

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:47.033
WORK FORCE IT IS WAITING- TO BE

02:01:47.099 --> 02:01:48.934
PART OF ALL THIS IN THE FUTURE

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:51.170
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO HI PAID-

02:01:51.237 --> 02:01:52.772
JOBS THAT WILL HELP THE ECONOMY

02:01:52.838 --> 02:01:54.106
WILL HELP THEIR FAMILIES AND SO

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:56.842
ON. BUT I SEE THAT DIGENIS THEN

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:59.011
HAS YOUR HAND UP SO JANICE- GO

02:01:59.078 --> 02:02:01.947
RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU- I DID

02:02:02.014 --> 02:02:04.450
WANT TO MENTION THAT AMMONIA

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:06.552
WHICH IS THAT YOU KNOW FORMULAS

02:02:06.619 --> 02:02:08.454
AND THE H. THREE. IT'S MOSTLY

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:11.590
HYDROGEN WAS THE NITROGEN- IS

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:14.393
USED AS AN- INGREDIENT MAKING

02:02:14.460 --> 02:02:16.829
FERTILIZER. AND SO CALIFORNIA

02:02:16.896 --> 02:02:19.131
TODAY DOES NOT PRODUCE AMMONIA

02:02:19.198 --> 02:02:23.369
WITHIN STATE WE IMPORT ALL OF

02:02:23.436 --> 02:02:26.005
IT. GO OF IT IS MADE FROM FOSSIL

02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:26.639
FUELS AND HYDROGEN. THAT'S AN

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:28.574
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO VERTICALLY

02:02:28.641 --> 02:02:30.109
INTEGRATE AND PROVIDE. GREEN

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:32.878
FERTILIZER FOR OUR VERY

02:02:32.945 --> 02:02:33.379
SUCCESSFUL AGRICULTURAL

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:35.214
INDUSTRY. AND WHAT'S ALSO

02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:36.882
INTERESTING ABOUT AMMONIA IS

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:39.819
IT'S POTENTIALLY. ON A LIQUID

02:02:39.885 --> 02:02:41.353
FUEL FOR VERY LONG HAUL

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:44.090
SHIPPING. SO MARITIME SHIPPING

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:45.157
MOVING GOODS BETWEEN STATES

02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:47.159
CHINA AND OUR PORTS PORT OF

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:51.263
OAKLAND- LONG BEACH- SO THERE'S

02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:54.100
AN INTERESTING NEXUS IS HERE-

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:56.268
INTO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION HOW

02:02:56.335 --> 02:02:58.070
ARE WE GOING TO GET THE

02:02:58.137 --> 02:02:59.271
HYDROGEN. TO THE PORTS THESE ARE

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:00.406
AREAS THAT WE WANT TO

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:03.642
DECARBONISE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:05.277
DIESEL USE. BEING FOR OPERATIONS

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:08.814
TRUCKS- IT COULD BE DELIVERED-

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:09.815
INTERNATIONALLY THERE ARE

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.617
COUNTRIES THAT ARE GEARING UP TO

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:13.452
EXPORT AMMONIA ALL OVER THE

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:16.422
WORLD FROM CHILE SAUDI ARABIA.

02:03:16.489 --> 02:03:17.423
PERSONALLY I THINK WE COULD BE

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:19.024
MAKING IT HERE VERY COST

02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:20.659
EFFECTIVELY AND SERVING ACTIVE

02:03:20.726 --> 02:03:23.963
OF THE- THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY

02:03:24.029 --> 02:03:26.699
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY AND WHAT WE

02:03:26.766 --> 02:03:28.968
FOUND IN OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT.

02:03:29.034 --> 02:03:30.836
100% GREEN HYDROGEN TRANSPORT

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:33.672
WAS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY

02:03:33.739 --> 02:03:36.876
THROUGH A PIPELINE. AND JUST TO

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.978
GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF COMPARISON-

02:03:39.044 --> 02:03:41.714
DELIVERY OF HYDROGEN ON A TRUCK

02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:42.815
WHICH IS HOW HYDROGEN'S

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.617
DELIVERED IN FUELING STATION THE

02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:46.886
DAY. WILL COST IF YOU DIGEST FOR

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:48.454
THE DELIVERY COMPONENT A FEW

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.890
DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM. IF THAT

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:52.792
SAME HYDROGEN WAS DELIVERED IN

02:03:52.858 --> 02:03:54.560
VOLUME YOU NEED TO HAVE A LARGER

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:57.229
VOLUME- IT TAKES THE COST DOWN

02:03:57.296 --> 02:03:58.831
TO SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY CENTS

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:02.935
PER KILOGRAM SO THAT'S THE POWER

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:04.370
OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN THE

02:04:04.436 --> 02:04:06.272
FINAL THING I WANTED TO SAY IS

02:04:06.338 --> 02:04:09.175
THAT HURDLE OF LINES. THERE

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:11.210
THERE'S NO RACIAL RISK IN THAT

02:04:11.277 --> 02:04:12.978
IN FACT THE UNITED STATES

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.914
ALREADY HAS SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.383
MILES OF HYDROGEN PIPELINE MOST

02:04:17.449 --> 02:04:19.251
OF IT'S IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:21.587
AND WE DO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE

02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:23.055
TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OF

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:24.557
HYDROGEN HIGH FLYING CONNECTING

02:04:24.623 --> 02:04:26.892

MUCH EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:50.509
ON- I'M FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.044

DOWN TO A POINT THAT IT MEETS OR

02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:37.556
BEATS THE COST OF STEAMER FORMED

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.591
HYDROGEN. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO

02:06:39.658 --> 02:06:41.093

MORE KNOCKS EMISSIONS- THAN THEY

02:14:35.066 --> 02:14:38.003
ALREADY ARE AND MANY OF THOSE

02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:39.704
INCREASE EMISSIONS WOULD CALM

02:14:39.771 --> 02:14:41.706
AND SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED

02:14:41.773 --> 02:14:43.208
AIR BASINS IN THE ENTIRE

COMMENTS ARE FOCUSED ON REALLY

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:49.200
ONE BIG ISSUE WHICH IS THE

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:51.503
IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING HYDROGEN

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:54.472
FROM ORGANIC WASTE AND BIOGAS IN

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:55.874
ANY DEFINITION OR PROGRAM

02:16:55.941 --> 02:16:57.742
FOCUSED ON GREEN HYDROGEN OR

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.644
CLEAN HYDROGEN AS WE MOVE

02:16:59.711 --> 02:17:01.379
FORWARD. LAWRENCE LIVERMORE

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:03.214
NATIONAL LABORATORIES TO REPORT

02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:04.916
I'M GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

02:17:04.983 --> 02:17:06.718
TWO YEARS AGO THAT MADE IT VERY

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:08.386
CLEAR THAT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE

02:17:08.453 --> 02:17:09.688
TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY

02:17:09.754 --> 02:17:11.289
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT CARBON

02:17:11.356 --> 02:17:13.525
NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND IT BY FAR

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:15.093
THE BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.561
NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS IS

02:17:16.628 --> 02:17:18.496
CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO

02:17:18.563 --> 02:17:20.265
HYDROGEN AD OTHER CARBON

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.133
NEGATIVE FUEL AND ENERGY SOURCES

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:24.102
BUT BY FAR THE MOST BENEFICIAL

02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:26.137
AND USE. OR ALTERNATIVE TO

02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:27.939
LANDFILLING AND OPEN BURNING OF

02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:29.975
ORGANIC WASTE IS CONVERTING IT

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.710
HYDROGEN AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:35.113
USE HYDROGEN TO REPLACE DIESEL.

02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:37.482
CALIFORNIA IN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:40.085
ORGANIC WASTE. OTHER- PILED AND

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.920
BURNED PILED AND LEFT TO DECAY

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:43.588
OR SENT TO LANDFILLS ALL OF

02:17:43.655 --> 02:17:44.923
WHICH RELEASED VERY VERY

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:47.225
POWERFUL AND DAMAGING SHORT

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:49.094
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT- SO BY

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:50.195
CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO

02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:51.863
HYDROGEN NOT ONLY DO WE PROVIDE

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:53.565
CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. BUT

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:54.399
WE CAN REDUCE SHORT LIVED

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:56.001
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WHICH IS THE

02:17:56.067 --> 02:17:58.637
MOST URGENT STEP WE NEED TO TAKE

02:17:58.703 --> 02:18:01.873
TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. SO

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:03.308
HAVING SAID ALL THAT. I REALLY

02:18:03.375 --> 02:18:05.076
WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE COMMENTS

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.611
THAT CARRIED HIM IN AND HONEST

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:08.513
LYNN. THERESA COOK AND OTHERS

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:10.649
MADE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:18:10.715 --> 02:18:12.217
ADOPTING DEFINITIONS OF CLEAN

02:18:12.283 --> 02:18:14.185
HYDROGEN OR GREEN HYDROGEN. THAT

02:18:14.252 --> 02:18:15.987
ARE BASED ON LIFE CYCLE

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:17.756
EMISSIONS AND NOT. CATEGORICALLY

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:19.424
DEEMING SOME FORMS OF HYDROGEN

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:22.627
CLEAN OR GREEN- BASED ON.

02:18:22.694 --> 02:18:25.397
FEEDSTOCK OR SINGLE POINT IN THE

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:26.498
PRODUCTION PROCESS IT'S REALLY

02:18:26.564 --> 02:18:28.500
IMPORTANT. THAT WE CONSIDER THE

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:30.735
ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS FROM

02:18:30.802 --> 02:18:32.404
DIFFERENT SOURCES AND CONVERSION

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:35.206
TECHNOLOGIES. I AM DOING SO I

02:18:35.273 --> 02:18:37.742
THINK WILL REALLY HELP US TO GO

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:39.878
TO CREATE HYDROGEN ECONOMY IN

02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:40.945
CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. AND THANK

02:18:41.012 --> 02:18:41.946

THE BEST FLIGHT COMMITTEE STAFF

02:18:53.558 --> 02:18:55.427
IN THE BUSINESS MY NAME IS BRADY

02:18:55.493 --> 02:18:56.728
BORDERING I'M WITH FUEL CELL

02:18:56.795 --> 02:18:58.396
ENERGY- WHERE US THIS

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:01.066
MANUFACTURE- STATIONARY FUEL

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:03.568
CELLS- BRING CONNECTICUT AND WE

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:05.737
ARE DEVELOPING TO HYDROGEN

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:07.472
APPLICATIONS- ONE ON THE ELECT.

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:09.441
SOLID OXIDE ELECTROLYSIS DIED

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:12.177
AND ANOTHER THAT USES- WASTE GAS

02:19:12.243 --> 02:19:14.879
LIKE BIO GAS TO CONVERT INTO

02:19:14.946 --> 02:19:17.015
HYDROGEN. FUEL CELLS TO PRODUCE

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:19.250
HYDROGEN WITHOUT ANY COMBUSTION-

02:19:19.317 --> 02:19:20.852
MEANING NO CARCINOGENIC OR SMOG

02:19:20.919 --> 02:19:22.320
FORMING POLLUTION LIKE KNOCKS

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:25.190
OUR SOCKS OR PM TWO POINT FIVE

02:19:25.256 --> 02:19:26.691
WE CAN USE RENEWABLE METHANE

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:28.193
FROM WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS

02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:29.828
OR LANDFILLS IN LOCAL

02:19:29.894 --> 02:19:31.262
GOVERNMENTS AND CITIES- AS THE

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:34.165
FEEDSTOCK- WE CAN ALSO COUPLE

02:19:34.232 --> 02:19:35.667
THE USE OF GREEN ENERGY AND

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:37.836
RECYCLED WATER ELECTROLYSIS

02:19:37.902 --> 02:19:39.938
PROCESS TO CREATE HYDROGEN.

02:19:40.004 --> 02:19:41.473
WHICH WOULD TRULY HAVE A MINIMAL

02:19:41.539 --> 02:19:46.211
IMPACT ON PRECIOUS. RESOURCES

02:19:46.277 --> 02:19:47.912
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IT

02:19:47.979 --> 02:19:49.180
STAYS. AND JUST TO TALK TOUCH A

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:51.616
LITTLE BIT MORE THE BIO GAS. OUR

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:52.617
FUEL CELLS USE CHEMISTRY

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:53.218
INTERNALLY. TO REFORM METHANE

02:19:53.284 --> 02:19:55.320
INTO HYDROGEN AND IN SOME CASES

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:57.288
ELECTRICITY AS WELL PREVENTING

02:19:57.355 --> 02:19:58.690
THE HARMFUL EMISSIONS AND

02:19:58.757 --> 02:19:59.724
PARTICULATE MATTER THAT COMES

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:02.093
FROM. BURNING OR REFORMING OF

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.095
METHANE THROUGH. SB METHANE

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:06.464
REFORMING PROCESS WHICH IS MOST

02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:08.333
COMMON TODAY. ACTION OF GOVERNOR

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:10.502
GRAY HYDROGEN- THAT'S WHAT WE

02:20:10.568 --> 02:20:12.036
THINK ARE BIOGAS HYDROGEN

02:20:12.103 --> 02:20:13.371
APPLICATION AT THE MOMENT GIVE

02:20:13.438 --> 02:20:15.173
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A REALLY GREAT

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.040
OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE GREEN

02:20:16.107 --> 02:20:18.476
HYDROGEN UPPER EHICLES FOR

02:20:18.543 --> 02:20:20.278
EVERY DUTY FLEETS- POTENTIALLY

02:20:20.345 --> 02:20:22.547
TO SELL HYDROGEN- AS A WAY TO

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:23.815
GENERATE REVENUE OR OR EVEN AS

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:25.116
AN ON SITE ENERGY STORAGE

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:27.552
APPLICATIONS- INTO BECAUSE

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:29.521
THAT'S THE FUEL CELLS USES BY A

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:31.256
GUEST ON SITE- WE THINK WHICH

02:20:31.322 --> 02:20:32.690
WATER FACILITIES CAN REALLY

02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:34.926
HARNESS OUR TECHNOLOGY- IN THIS

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:36.528
WAY FOR REVENUE GENERATION. THEY

02:20:36.594 --> 02:20:37.729
CAN POTENTIALLY USE WASTE HEAT

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:38.696
RECOVERY TO IMPROVE THE

02:20:38.763 --> 02:20:40.331
EFFICIENCY OF THEIR DIGEST HERS

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:42.500
AND ESPECIALLY THIS IS IMPORTANT

02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:44.102
AS WE SPEAK OR CENTER LARA'S

02:20:44.169 --> 02:20:46.137
BILL AS THE AT THIRTEEN EIGHTY

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:50.074
THREE COME INTO EFFECT WITH.

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:51.042
ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION. I JUST

02:20:51.109 --> 02:20:52.744
ADDED NOTE. WE ARE THE PROCESS

02:20:52.811 --> 02:20:54.078
OF BUILDING A- TWO POINT EIGHT

02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:55.613
MEGAWATT FUEL CELL SYSTEM AT THE

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:56.714
PORT OF LONG BEACH IN

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.583
CONJUNCTION WITH TOYOTA. AND

02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:00.819
THAT PROJECT WILL TAKE- BIO GAS

02:21:00.885 --> 02:21:02.954
AND CONVERT IT INTO ABOUT TWELVE

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.556
HUNDRED. WITH OVER A THOUSAND

02:21:04.622 --> 02:21:06.324
KILOGRAMS OF HYDROGEN TODAY

02:21:06.391 --> 02:21:08.393
GREEN HYDROGEN AND ALSO PRODUCE.

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:09.894
GREENLIT TRISTIQUE TO BE SOLD

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:11.529
BACK TO EDISON'S GRAND. AND

02:21:11.596 --> 02:21:12.730
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:13.965
PROJECT BOTH BECAUSE IT'S AN

02:21:14.032 --> 02:21:15.400
EXAMPLE OF THREE HYDROGEN BEING

02:21:15.466 --> 02:21:17.502
PRODUCED IN THE MALAY BASIN BUT

02:21:17.569 --> 02:21:19.904
ALSO BECAUSE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:21.539
A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:22.841

WITH THIS INITIATIVE PART OF

02:28:10.014 --> 02:28:11.649
LONG BEACH IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:13.651
ENGINE NOT ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.886
BUT FOR THE NATION WE PREFER

02:28:15.953 --> 02:28:17.154
THAT EVERYTHING RUNS SMOOTHLY

02:28:17.221 --> 02:28:19.090
AND THAT WERE NOT IN THE

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:20.891
SPOTLIGHT AFTER THAT WE AVE

02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:21.559
BEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT IN

02:28:21.626 --> 02:28:23.794
SPITE OF MYRIAD PROBLEMS WE HAVE

02:28:23.861 --> 02:28:25.930
MOVED TO RECORD AMOUNTS OF CARGO

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:28.232
SINCE MID TWENTY TWENTY THE CARD

02:28:28.299 --> 02:28:29.967
WILL BENEFIT EVERYONE BUT THE

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:31.969
IMPACTS ARE FELT ACUTELY BY OUR

02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:35.206
NEIGHBORS MOSTLY DISADVANTAGED

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:36.607
COMMUNITIES. PARTS OF LONG BEACH

MY ANGELES ADOPTED AGGRESSIVE

02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:40.378
ZERO MISSION GOALS FOR OUR

02:28:40.444 --> 02:28:42.179
MARINE TERMINALS. AND THE

02:28:42.246 --> 02:28:43.848
SUPPORTING TRACKING INDUSTRY.

02:28:43.914 --> 02:28:45.316
AND WHILE WE REMAIN NEUTRAL

02:28:45.383 --> 02:28:46.484
ABOUT HOW ZERO EMISSIONS ARE

02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:48.552
ACHIEVED WE KNOW THAT HYDROGEN

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:51.622
WILL PLAY A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN

02:28:51.689 --> 02:28:53.190
THIS EFFORT. FOR THE CREATION OF

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:54.892
A ONE OR MORE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:56.661
HUBS HOPEFULLY TWO IN

02:28:56.727 --> 02:28:58.663
CALIFORNIA. AND BELIEVE THAT

02:28:58.729 --> 02:29:00.464
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS IMPORTANT

02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:03.434
AT THE CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:04.635
IS THE LOGICAL PLACE FOR ONE OF

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.337
THEM. IN LONG BEACH WERE IN THE

02:29:06.404 --> 02:29:07.538
MIDDLE OF THE WILMINGTON WELL

02:29:07.605 --> 02:29:09.407
FILLED WITH A VAST NETWORK OF

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:10.641
OIL AND GAS PIPELINES AND IT

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:12.376
MAKES SENSE TO REPURPOSE THE IS

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:13.611
RIGHT THE WAY. PROVIDERS

02:29:13.678 --> 02:29:15.613
INCONVENIENCE ESPECIALLY WITH

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:17.715
THE PORT AS TERMINUS SO THAT WE

02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:19.216
CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER

02:29:19.283 --> 02:29:20.751
CLASS HEADED IMPOSSIBLE IN THE

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.887
SEAPORT INDUSTRY. AND ALSO

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:25.056
PROVIDE A CONDUIT FOR THE IMPORT

02:29:25.122 --> 02:29:27.525
AND EXPORT OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN

02:29:27.591 --> 02:29:29.460
AND AMMONIA. WE ASK THAT ANY

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:31.429
LEGISLATION PASSED IN CALIFORNIA

02:29:31.495 --> 02:29:33.197
ALLOWS STATE AGENCIES IN GRANT

02:29:33.264 --> 02:29:35.333
APPLICANTS. TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:37.768
APPROPRIATIONS. NOT ONLY THE

02:29:37.835 --> 02:29:39.737
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:40.738
BUT OTHERS SUCH AS

HYDROGEN TRUCK ACT IN HYDROGEN

02:29:44.508 --> 02:29:46.377
PURPORTS THAT. SHOULD THEY BE

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:48.813
SIGNED INTO LAW. A LOT OF MONEY

02:29:48.879 --> 02:29:49.547
WILL BE NEEDED IN VARIOUS

02:29:49.613 --> 02:29:51.749
SECTORS INCLUDING THE TESTING

02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:53.017
AND MANUFACTURE OF FUEL CELL

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:54.418
CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT A

02:29:54.485 --> 02:29:56.721
MARINE TERMINAL. FEEL FELT HEAVY

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:58.522
DUTY TRACTOR BEING DEMONSTRATED

02:29:58.589 --> 02:30:00.257
NOW BUT THE COST OF THESE

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:02.727
VEHICLES FAR EXCEED WHAT ARE

02:30:02.793 --> 02:30:05.796
LOCAL TRUCK OWNERS WHO NUMBER IN

02:30:05.863 --> 02:30:07.565
THE THOUSANDS CAN AFFORD. ALSO

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:10.067
AS CALIFORNIANS INCREASE THEIR

02:30:10.134 --> 02:30:12.303
USE OF ELECTRICITY AND AT THE

02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:14.572
SAME TIME OUR CLIMATE CHANGES

02:30:14.638 --> 02:30:16.173
RENEWABLE HYDROGEN COMPLAIN

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:17.575
IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENHANCING

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:21.746
GRID MORE RELIABLE. FUEL CELLS

02:30:21.812 --> 02:30:23.114
CAN BE USED TO BALLOTS

02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:24.915
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND DEMAND

02:30:24.982 --> 02:30:27.918
BOTH AS A LOCAL ENERGY RESOURCES

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:28.352

WHAT INDUSTRIAL PROVIDER OF

02:31:25.810 --> 02:31:27.645
HYDROGEN INTO THE MARKET AND

02:31:27.711 --> 02:31:28.279
HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN THE

02:31:28.345 --> 02:31:30.448
CALIFORNIA ENERGY TRANSITION FOR

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:32.850
MANY YEARS NOW. I WOULD LIKE TO

02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:34.318
BUILD A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT

02:31:34.385 --> 02:31:36.220
HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE I LIKE TO

02:31:36.287 --> 02:31:37.788
FOCUS ON A FEW FROM AN INDUSTRY

02:31:37.855 --> 02:31:39.123
PERSPECTIVE. FIRST OFF YOU MIGHT

02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:40.524
RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT

02:31:40.591 --> 02:31:41.625
NECESSARILY THE HOME ITSELF THAT

02:31:41.692 --> 02:31:42.993
IS MOST INTERESTING TO INDUSTRY

02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:45.095
BUT RATHER THE OUTCOME OF A

02:31:45.162 --> 02:31:46.997
REGIONAL MARKET SUSTAINABLE WHAT

02:31:47.064 --> 02:31:48.699
ALLOWS FOR GROWTH IN A GOING

02:31:48.766 --> 02:31:50.201
PRIVATE INVESTMENT MEASURED IN

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:51.602
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:53.737
WANTED TO INCREASE IT FOR ALL

02:31:53.804 --> 02:31:54.772
CALIFORNIANS IT'S MOST IMPORTANT

DOWN TO A SINGLE WORD UNEDITED

02:32:02.146 --> 02:32:03.113
MOMENTUM WE HAVE MOMENTUM WITH

TRANSITION TO GREEN HYDROGEN THE

02:32:27.605 --> 02:32:29.173
FACT OF THE MATTER IS ALMOST

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:30.608
EVERY MOLECULE OF HYDROGEN IS

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:32.543
GOING INTO A FUEL CELL VEHICLE

02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:35.679
TODAY. IS ALREADY RENEWABLE. LOW

02:32:35.746 --> 02:32:37.581
