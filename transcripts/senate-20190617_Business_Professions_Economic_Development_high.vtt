00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.335
HERE'S MY CONCERN IF WE SET A

00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.504
FEE NOW AND THE REPORT COMES OUT

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:06.538
AND SAYS THAT THE FEES ARE

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:07.306
ADEQUATE.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:08.473
THEN IT COMES BACK TO THE

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.509
LEGISLATURE NOBODY LIKES TO VOTE

00:20:10.576 --> 00:20:12.511
ON ANYTHING THAT INCREASES FEES

00:20:12.578 --> 00:20:14.146
OR TAXES.

00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:15.280
SO WOULD WOULD WE JUST BE BETTER

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:17.049
SERVED IF WE JUST WAIT A LITTLE

00:20:17.115 --> 00:20:18.684
WHILE BECAUSE THE BILL THE

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.118
REPORT COMES OUT A COUPLE WEEKS

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:21.486
FOR THAT HAD OCCURRED TO ME AS

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:24.523
WELL -- THE BUT THAT THIS

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.192
INDUSTRY FACES THE BIGGEST

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.327
CHALLENGE FROM THE BLACK MARKET

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.962
THERE ARE SEVERAL BILLS PENDING

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:30.596
IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.898
ACTUALLY -- INSTITUTE A HOLIDAY

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:34.800
ON THOSE FEES BECAUSE OF THESE

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.034
ENORMOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.035
WITH ENFORCEMENT IN THE BLACK

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:38.437
MARKET IN TRYING TO GUIDE.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.339
CONSUMER ACTIVITY INTO THE LEGAL

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.140
CHANNELS SO -- MY RESPONSE TO

00:20:42.207 --> 00:20:44.142
THAT WOULD BE IT I WOULD SAY IT

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.110
IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THE

00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:47.613
LEGISLATURE WOULD -- OR EVEN THE

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.014
GIRL CANNABIS CONTROL WOULD ACT

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:52.417
TO RAISE THOSE FEES ANYTIME IN

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:53.085
THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:55.654
AND IN INDEED WE MAY BE OUR BE

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.222
REDUCING THEM IF SOME OF THESE

00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:58.190
BILLS PASSED SO WE'RE JUST

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.625
TRYING TO STABLISH THE CURRENT

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:00.959
AMOUNT AS MAXIMUMS.

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.094
AND NOT TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.261
GO UP IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:04.529
THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:05.764
HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:07.499
THE RECEIPT THESE BECAUSE WE'RE

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:08.800
THINKING OF THE BIG PICTURE I

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.002
MEAN THE BUREAU CAMPUS CONTROL

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:11.003
THE THINKING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:11.903
REVENUE THAT THEY NEED. TO DO

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.305
THEIR JOB OF REGULATING THE

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:14.606
INDUSTRY WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.408
AMOUNT OF A FEE STRUCTURE THAT

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:18.276
WE NEED TO CHANNEL THIS ACTIVITY

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.612
INTO LEGAL CHANNELS AND TO TO

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:21.246
MAKE SURE THAT WE WE HAVE A A

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.014
FLOURISHING INDUSTRY IN

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.048
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK IT'S

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.483
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY.

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.218
THAT ANY WOULD WOULD WOULD AGREE

00:21:26.284 --> 00:21:28.420
THAT THE GREATER FEES ARE A GOOD

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:32.591
IDEA AND IN FACT WE MAY BE

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:33.225
HAVING DISCUSSION ABOUT LOWERING

00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:33.659
THOSE FEES.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:34.559
WELL I THINK THAT'S VERY

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:35.627
OPTIMISTIC -- ONLY BECAUSE THIS

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.562
IS SUCH A NEW INDUSTRY AND AND

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:38.964
WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE FEE

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:39.998
STRUCTURE WE SET IS ACTUALLY

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.833
WORKING BUT WE WILL KNOW THAT IN

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.535
TWO WEEKS ACTUALLY YEAH IN

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:45.070
EXACTLY TWO WEEKS.

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:47.472
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO YOU KNOW A

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.074
TO AMENDING THE BILL OR SAYING

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.108
THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET THIS

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:51.443
IN JUST TWO WEEKS SO WE HAVE

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.878
PLENTY OF TIME.

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.779
THAT YOU WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.514
SAY HEY MAYBE WE NEED TO

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.682
RESTRUCTURE IT.

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:57.683
I'VE WE WILL CERTAINLY BE

00:21:57.749 --> 00:22:00.052
LOOKING AT THAT I THINK THAT WE

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:00.619
ARE DOUBLE REFERRED IS THAT

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.820
RIGHT.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:05.223
I THINK YOU'RE SEEING SO HARD.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:05.824
OKAY PROBES OKAY FILLED WITH

00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:07.092
FISCAL IMPACTS OF THE CONCERN IS

WITH THE LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.428
BUT I'M SURE THAT I MEAN

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:10.696
OBVIOUSLY TWO WEEKS WE'RE NOT

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:11.596
GOING TO CLEAR.

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:12.597
THE SENATE CHAMBER AND I'M SURE

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:13.632
THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:14.499
GOING TO BE HAVING WE WANT TO BE

00:22:14.566 --> 00:22:16.368
PART OF THE SOLUTION TO THE

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:17.502
PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING NOT TRY TO

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:18.036
MAKE THINGS WORSE HERE.

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:20.572
