GREAT LEGACY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING. WITH SENATOR HART AND GETTING TO KNOW HIM. HERE IN THIS CHAMBER AND ON THE BOARD OF THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE CALIFORNIA WE SERVE TOGETHER. I SAW FIRST HAND IS LEGISLATOR AND- AS IT AT THE PP I SEE WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY STUDENT TO PUBLIC POLICY HE WAS MEMBERS THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM SENATOR HART'S DEVOTION. AN EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC SERVICE. HIS CAREER HIS CAREER BEGAN IN A CLASSROOM WHERE HE TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL GOVERNMENT. HOW FITTING. HE BROUGHT THAT EXPERIENCE WITH HIM AS HE COMMITTED HIMSELF TO BETTERING OUR STATE'S EDUCATION SYSTEM. SENATOR HART WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND SERVED THERE UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. WHEN HE WAS ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. HIS SERVICE IN THE LEGISLATURE SPAN THREE GOVERNORS. GOVERNOR BROWN COLORED MEIJIN GOVERNOR WILSON DURING A TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS MORE PURPLE IT IS POLITICS TWO OF THE THREE GOVERNORS HE SERVED WITH. REPUBLICANS HE'S PERHAPS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS WORK IN TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. IS WORK TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE IMPROVE TEACHER QUALITY AND ESTABLISH GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. LANDMARK LEGISLATION IN NINETEEN EIGHT TO ESTABLISH CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA PAVING THE WAY FOR THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHARTER CAMPUSES WE SEE ACROSS THE STATE TODAY. AND THEY COLLECTIVELY SERVE ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. BUDGET CATION WAS A PASSION HE ALSO ADVANCED EXTRAORDINARY LEGISLATION ON CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN WOMEN'S RIGHTS. GEHRY CREATED SOLAR TAX CREDIT THAT HELPED CALIFORNIA BECOME A WORLDWIDE LEADER IN SOLAR INNOVATION ADOPTION WHILE ALSO FURTHERING ENVIRONMENTAL AND COASTAL PROTECTIONS. HE ALSO PASSED A LAW TO INCREASE CHILD SUPPORT FOR DIVORCED WOMEN. THAT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG WHAT SENATOR HART DID HERE IN THIS CHAMBER AND IN THE OTHER HOUSE DURING HIS TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THERE ARE FEW WHO CAN CLAIM SO MANY FAR REACHING POLICY SUCCESSES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AFTER HE SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE HE EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO BECOME THE EDUCATION SECRETARY.

SENATOR HART WAS SUCH A PRINCIPLE PERSON AND YOU GAIN RESPECT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE GOVERNOR DAVIS RECENTLY SAID THAT HE COULD NOT RECALL A SINGLE PERSON IN SACRAMENTO WHO EVER SAID A CRITICAL WORD ABOUT GARY AND I THINK THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND I HAVE THE SAME RECOLLECTION STUDENT ISSUES MOST LEGISLATORS HELD A DEEP RESPECT FOR HIM BECAUSE HIS ACTIONS WERE ALWAYS MOTIVATED. BUT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT THING TO DO. IT SHOULD BE THAT MUCH OF HIS LEGISLATIVE SUCCESS. TO BE ABLE TO CLOSELY WORK WITH MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND IMPORTANTLY. HE DEDICATES DEDICATED LOYAL STAFF AGAIN. THEY SAID EARLIER HE LEAVES HIS WIFE GARY HART WAS HERE TODAY. HE TRICIA KAISER. WITH THREE DAUGHTERS ALYSSA KATHERINE AND LAURA.

GARY HART IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE LEADERS WHO STEPS PRECEDED MINE FOLLOWED HIS REPRESENTATION OF THE CENTRAL COAST I AM HONORED TO RECOGNIZE HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WELL HE SERVED IN THE LEGISLATURE. GERRY'S COMMITMENT TO SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES SET CHANGES IN MOTION FOR MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. WHICH I CAN PROUDLY SAY WE HAVE pHIS WORK TO STRENGTHEN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. OUR EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS ALL AROUND UNDERSTOOD HIS IMPACT. WHETHER IT WAS FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE AND HIGHER EDUCATION CLASS SIZE TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OR HIS LEGISLATION CREATING A PATH FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

IN ADDITION WE CANNOT OVERLOOK HIS LEGISLATION CREATING THE SOLAR TAX CREDIT. AS I READ SEVERAL PIECES ABOUT GARY IN THE DISTRICT FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS PASSING IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS HIGHLY RESPECTED. I REMEMBER GETTING INTO OFFICE AND MEETING WITH GARY IN MY OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO YOU JUST TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT HE HAD WHILE IN SACRAMENTO BUT THAT REFLECTED THE VOICES IN THE LIVES OF THE CENTRAL COAST. HIS CHARACTER LEAD TO POLICY CHANGES FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR ENTIRE STATE. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A BRIEF MEETING IT WAS A GLIMPSE OF HIS PERSONALITY. AND WHAT HE BROUGHT TO THE CAPITAL WHEN HE REPRESENTED SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT THE ONE A COMMON WORD THEY USE TO DESCRIBE GARY.

THE PUBLIC EDUCATION EMBRACED THE ROLE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION. NOT AS A COMPETITOR BUT AS A COMPLIMENT. THAT IS PIONEERING LEGISLATION. LIVES ON THIS DAY. ONCE UPON A TIME WE USED TO DO A LOT OF INTRUM HEARINGS. AND THAT'S ONE THOSE FEW OF US ON THOSE ENTERING COMMITTEES. GOT TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF. ONE ON ONE TIME WITH EACH OTHER. AND THEN EVENING HAVING DINNER. AFTER HERE. AND I REMEMBER MANY SUCH OCCASIONS WITH GARY BECAUSE I DID A NUMBER OF THINGS IN EDUCATION AS WELL AND OTHER AREAS WERE AND WE SERVE.

YOU YOU REPRESENT YOU KNOW THE NORTHWESTERN PART OF LA AND- BUT THAT WASN'T HIS ADVICE HIS ADVICES. PEOPLE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY GOOD. IT DIDN'T MATTER WHERE I REPRESENTED I CAN JUST BE MYSELF. AND TO MOVE OUR AREAS I MEAN FROM SANTA BARBARA ALL THE WAY DOWN TO VENTURA COUNTY IN LA AND- NOT SHAPE SHIFTING BE THE SAME PERSON EVERYWHERE YOU WENT- THAT WAS A SPECIAL THING TO BE EXPOSED TO IT- VERY EARLY PART OF MY CAREER AND VERY FORMATIVE AND SO. I MEMBER WE HAD PANCAKES I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. HE THE ENTIRE PLATE- WITH A MAN WHO NOT LEFT THIS BUILDING EVEN THOUGH HE WAS GONE AND- THAT KIND OF LEGACY TO ME. IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO APPROACH A JOB LIKE OURS. THAT YOU CAN THINK YOU'VE GOT YOUR TIME AND THEN YOU MOVE ON. BUT THAT.

AND GARY HART WAS ONE OF THOSE FOLKS WHO WAS CLEARED OF US WAS IMPORTANT- LEADER IN THE EDUCATION SPACE AND I NEEDED TO GET TO GET TO KNOW. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRIKES ME. ABOUT THE FIRST MEETING AND I AND ALL THE SUBSEQUENT OBSERVATIONS OF HIM. THE COURSE OF HIS LEGISLATIVE CAREER WAS THAT. IT WAS NEVER THE LEGISLATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS. THAT I REMEMBER AND I KNOW THERE WERE MANY AS HAVE BEEN SPOKEN TO TODAY. BUT REALLY WHAT'S STUCK OUT FOR ME AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY WAS THAT. HE REPRESENTED THE- THE QUALITY OF LEADERSHIP THE CONDUCT OF LEADERSHIP- MORE THAN THE SUBSTANCE. HE WAS A GOOD LISTENER HE HE WAS THOUGHTFUL. HE SHOWED ME THE POWER OF A SOFT VOICE AND HE HAD A SOFT VOICE. SHOWED ME THE IMPORTANCE OF GRACIOUSNESS. AND SO AS YOU LOOK AT HIS CAREER AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HE INFLUENCE THE INTERNS THE FELLOWS THE STUDENTS IN HIS CLASS. HIS STYLE AND APPROACH TO LEADERSHIP. IS THE THING THAT I KNOW HE INVESTED A LOT OF. IS THOUGHT TO AND IT COMMUNICATED AND IS BEEN EFFECTIVE T ALL THOSE WHO HAVE FOLLOWED HIM IN THE PATH OF GOVERNMENT OR WORLD EVER ELSE THEY HAVE.

STATE OF EMERGENCY. FUNDS WILL BE USED TO INCREASE TESTING CAPACITY.

THANK YOU FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE ON THE SIDE OF ANY FURTHER DESCRIPTION IS RIGHT ON THE SIDE OF SENATOR WILL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. ALTHOUGH THERE'S MANY GREAT THINGS IN THIS BUDGET. BILL THERE'S SOME THERE'S NOT SO I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY- OPPOSE THIS MEASURE TODAY. WHEN THE PROVISIONS IN THIS IS EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TO VALENCIA LABS. WHICH IS A FACILITY IN MY DISTRICT. DURING THE PANDEMIC GOVERNOR NWSOM CAME TO MY DISTRICT WITH GREAT FANFARE TO ANNOUNCE THIS NEW VENTURE. WHICH BY THE WAY WAS A- NO BID SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACT. AND IT WAS GOING TO TESTING IT WAS CAN BE MARVELOUS. WELL IT'S BEEN A COMPLETE FIASCO. IF THEY'RE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- FOR THEIR FOR THE INCOMPETENCE AND POTENTIAL CORRUPTION- THERE IS INVESTIGATION DONE BY THE STATE THE STATE HELD ONTO IT WAS DUE IN MARCH. THEY DIDN'T RELEASE IT. AND THEY DID RELEASE AN IMMENSELY BUT THEY RELEASED IT RIGHT AFTER THE- THE RECALL WAS OVER. AND THEN WITHOUT FANFARE HE DID AN AUTOMATIC RENEWAL OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO THIS COMPANY- THEY'RE CHARGING PEOPLE ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY ONE TO FIFTY DOLLARS TO TEST. WHEN YOU CAN GET IT ON THE OPEN MARKET FOR TWELVE DOLLARS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD TO THE WORST PERFORMING TESTING FACILITY IN THE STATE- L. A. U. S. D. IN THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'RE SO FRUSTRATED WITH THEM THAT THEY HAVE NO THEY NO LONGER TESTS THERE. AND I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. MAYBE YOU HAVE TO GIVE AN EXECUTIVE SOME POWER TO BE ABLE TO MANEUVER QUICKLY. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE I THINK WE'VE REALLY FALLEN DOWN ON THE JOB IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING IN TERMS OVERSIGHT. THIS IS A FACILITY THAT SHOULD BE PROBABLY SHUT DOWN AND TODAY WE'RE GONNA GET ANOTHER EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR. SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M GONNA READ RESPECTFULLY BE A NO VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. OR DEBATE ON THE SIDE OF. SO WIENER. I THANK MR PRESIDENT ON MY RIGHT SO OF THIS MEASURE AND SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNOR ON OUR BUDGET I CHAIR IN SOUTH OF FOR THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE FUND DOES NOT RUN OUT OF MONEY- AND TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE ARE EXPECTING MORE FEDERAL SUPPORT BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT'S COMING AND SO MAKING SURE THE CASH FLOW IS THERE AND THAT WE'RE FRONTING THAT CASH FLOW. SO THAT RENTERS IN CALIFORNIA- I CAN ACCESS THOSE LIFESAVING FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND SO THE LANDLORDS ARE PARTICULARLY SMALL LANDLORDS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT BACK RENT THAT IS BEING PAID IT'S HARD TO OVERSTATE HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- THIS RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH AND HOPEFULLY COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC SO MANY RENTERS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES SO MANY RENTERS ARE AT RISK OF HAVING LONG TERM CRUSHING RENT THAT. IN SO MANY LANDLORDS ARE REST OF FOREVER REALISTICALLY LOSING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE RENT THAT THEY ARE OWED THIS FUND IS SO IMPORTANT AND IT HAS BEEN IT'S BEEN RUNNING OUT OF MONEY- AND SO I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OFFERED KEEPING IT GOING THANK YOU.

SKINNER SKINNER PREPARED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL ONE FOURTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELIGIOUS THE BUDGET. CENTER CENTER THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB ONE FOURTEEN REESTABLISHES THE COVERT NINETEEN SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS THAT WERE PART OF OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- WE ALL ARE QUITE AWARE OF THE SURGEON COVERED NINETEEN CASES. AND WE ARE. THIS ACT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE SICK CAN. TAKE THE PAID SICK LEAVE THAT THEY NEED SO THAT ALL OF US ARE PROTECTED NONE OF US WANT TO HAVE TO GO TO A WORKPLACE WHERE WORKERS ARE SICK. AND OR GET THEIR TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO MAY BE SICK. SB ONE FOURTEEN REQUIRES EMPLOYERS WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE UP TO FORTY HOURS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE. IN ADDITION IT ENTITLES A COVERED EMPLOYEE TO TAKE UP TO FORTY HOURS OF THIS SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE. IF THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBER. IF FIVE IS TEST POSITIVE FOR COVERT NINETEEN AND DOES THE EMPLOYER MUST CARE FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS THE BILL APPLIES RETROACTIVELY TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR. ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT LANDED ON THIS AND FOR WHICH WE ARE THERE'S BEEN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THAT MEMBERS I ASKED HER I DON'T. THINK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR BORDERS. GUESS WHAT. TESTING TESTING. THIS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THAT WE PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF- SECURITY FOR EMPLOYEES LOOKS AFTER THE WHOLE OF THE ECONOMY. MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS THOUGH IS THAT WE'RE ASKING THESE INDIVIDUAL ENTERPRISES TO SHOULDER THE BILL. WE'VE GOT ESTIMATES THAT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE BILLION IN SURPLUS THIS YEAR LAST YEAR WAS SEVENTY FIVE TO OVER A HUNDRD. IF THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOT UPPING THE ANTE TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF TAX CREDITS WITH THIS AMOUNT OF SERVICE SHOULD WE NOT AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDED. SO ASKING SMALL BUSINESSES TO DO SO I THINK IT'S AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN WHEN WE HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO STEP IN AND LEAD ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S AS MERITORIOUS AS COVERT PRECAUTIONS. BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM HAS HAD SOME DEGREE OF EXPERIENCE WITH EITHER CONSTITUENTS FOR DIRECT FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS. WHO HAVE HAD CODE OR BEEN EXPOSED TO CORPORATE OR FORCIBLY QUARANTINED NO ONE IS IMMUNE FROM THIS. AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE PROTOCOLS WHETHER IT'S TEN DAYS OR FIVE DAYS ACCORDING TO CDC. TEND TO MISS OUT ON WORK AND NOT GET PAID COULD BE DETRIMENTAL. I THINK CALIFORNIA'S TO STEP UP IN LEAD IN THIS AREA IN THIS SPACE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES IT IS A MATTER. UP VOTE AGAINST THIS ITEM NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT IT DOES BUT BECAUSE THE FUNDING SOURCES IS IMPROPERLY PLACED. AND I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA'S STEP UP AND DO THIS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. HEARING AND SEEING NINE CENTER SKINNER TO LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I WOULD JUST NOTE AS I INDICATED THE OPENING THAT THIS AFFECTS ONLY EMPLOYERS OF TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR MORE AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS SB ONE THIRTEEN IS THE ECONOMIC RELIEF TRAILER BILL. AND AS YOU RECALL. IN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN WE WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST HIT. AND THE STOCK MARKET INITIALLY FELL. WE WERE NOT CLEAR WHAT HOW REVENUES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE AFFECTED. AND SO WE SUSPENDED A FEW OF OUR- A BUSINESS TAX. PROGRAMS THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTIONS AND A COUPLE OF THINGS AND WE- HAVE REALIZED OF COURSE SINCE THAT TIME THAT OUR REVENUES HAVE STAYED HEALTHY THE STOCK MARKET DID BETTER THAN EXPECTED AND SO THIS ECONOMIC RELIEF TRAILER BILL. LIFTS A YEAR EARLY THE SUSPENSIONS THAT WE MADE ON THOSE TWO ON THE NET OPERATING LOSS IN THE TAX CREDITS REDUCE TAX PAYMENTS WE ALSO ARE IN THIS BILL PROVIDING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO OUR SMALL BUSINESS GRANT PROGRAM IS YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED AND IS- WE HAVE MORE APPLICANTS. THAN THE FUNDS WE HAVE AVAILABLE SO THIS HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION WILL ENABLE US TO FIND THE REMAINING ELIGIBLE WAIT LISTED APPLICANTS. IT THIS BILL ALSO CONFORM STATE TAX LAW. TO FEDERAL TAX LAW FOR RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FIND AND FEDERAL SHUTTERED VENUE OPERATORS GRANTS AND EXCLUDES THESE GRANT PROCEEDS SO THESE FEDERAL GRANT PROCEEDS FROM STATE TAXABLE INCOME IT ALSO MAKES A VARIETY OF CHANGES RELATED TO THE ELECTIVE PASS THROUGH ENTITY TAX AND TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS CAN FULLY DEDUCT ON THEIR FEDERAL TAX RETURNS THE CALIFORNIA TAXES THEY PAY ON PASS THROUGH BUSINESS INCOME AND FINALLY INCLUDES CLEAN UP LANGUAGE THAT- TO ENSURE THAT THE ASSISTANCE FOR RELIEF THAT WAS PROVIDED. TO CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR ARREARS ON WATER WASTEWATER GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS NOT CONSIDERED AS TAX- UNDER INCOME FOR TAX OR BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY PURPOSES. AND WITH THAT I ESPERANDO. THANK YOU ANY FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR HERTZBERG. BIJLI MISTER RICHARD I JUST WANTED TO THANK BUDGET COMMITTEE I ALSO WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND GOVERNANCE OF FINANCE. THE DEALT IN THE DETAILS OF SOME OF THESE ENDEAVORS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATED TO THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FEDERAL TAX ACT WHICH CREATED THE SALT DEDUCTION THAT ADVERSELY AFFECTED CALIFORNIA SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND I JUST THINK THAT THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL TO FIX SOME OF THOSE MATTERS WERE QUITE IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. TO ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTIONS AND- I APPRECIATE THAT AND ASK YOUR SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU RIGHT. SENATOR VOTE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE- WE MUST LIFT THE SUSPENSION OF THE NET OPERATING LOSS AND DEDUCTION AND THE CAP ON BUSINESS INCENTIVE TAX CREDITS SUCH AS THE R&amp;D CREDIT THAT WERE IMPOSED TO ADDRESS A BUDGET SHORTFALL THERE REALLY NEVER MATERIALIZED AB EIGHTY FIVE OF TWENTY TWENTY TRIGGERED THE SUSPENSION OF THE N. O. L. PRODUCTION AND THEY ARE INDEED TAX CREDIT DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM LEGISLATIVE REPUBLICANS IN A HUGE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA JOB CREATORS.
