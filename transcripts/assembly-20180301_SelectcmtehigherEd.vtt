My local students and students

to be with us today.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm looking forward to hearing

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
your voices on how we can ensure

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:00.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the California master plan may

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
better meet the needs

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
all students.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
An as a historian I would be

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
remiss if I didn't take a moment

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
to talk just.

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
For a second about how important

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
stays to our future. By

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
highlighting our past.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The post World War two era has

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
had significant.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Impact on the reorganization of

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
American higher education.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Of the approximately seventeen

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
states during the late nineteen

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
fifties and sixties that

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
modified their public and

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
private systems to promote

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
coordination. Control costs and

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
insurance system that is built

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
to educate the public.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:36.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
None.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
None that the massive work that

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:40.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
California did.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That work then resulted in a

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:43.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
system that was the envy of the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
world.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
During the nineteen fifties

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
California's. To find the common

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
vision for higher education

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
system.

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:53.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And at the opening of the

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
negotiation process.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:57.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Books have been read about that

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:58.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
tense time.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:01.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
It was understood by all but the

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
stakes were extremely high.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
For that university of

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
California for the state's

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges and more importantly

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for the people and future of

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
California.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I would argue that today the

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
stakes.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Are even more I.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Clark Kerr the president then of

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you see was a key figure in the

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
development of the at California

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
master plan.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:25.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The plan set up a coherent

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:26.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
system for post secondary

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
education which to find the

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
specific roles. Already existing

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
university of California.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:35.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
But then California state

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college to system of senior

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges which we now know as

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:41.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the California State. University

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:42.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
system and the California

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
community college system.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
The plan referred.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
He keenly to curse vision and

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:50.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the role and the importance of

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
higher education in the mid

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:54.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
twenty century America.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:56.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
His insights in California's

00:03:56.703 --> 00:03:58.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
changing needs and aspirations

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
with pivotal to the development.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It's development an adaptation

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
required both pragmatism and

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
political skill.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
These three guys I know are

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:09.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
listening to that last word who

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
political skill.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It's implementation propelled

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
California her education to

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:15.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
national and international

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
prominence.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
However. As demographics.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:22.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
In the years wore on. The

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:23.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
economic and educational

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
circumstances in realities have

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:26.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
changed over the year.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Young man in the front can you

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
hold up that device for second.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Fuller pi.

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
That wasn't around in the

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
nineteen sixties.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And a think about it much has

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
changed in the nineteen sixties.

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So again I want to welcome all

of you to Fresno City College.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It is my hope that through the

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
series of informational sessions

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we can embody the spirit that

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:49.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
those held during those

00:04:49.522 --> 00:04:50.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
courageous conversations of the.

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And to be bold in our planning

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of our future.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:55.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Is my hope that the work that

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
takes place today and future

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sessions will continue to hasten

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the planting of the seeds of

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
hope for our future.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Our mutual trust.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And and ordered Forest to be

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:07.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
removed forward and created new

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
shared vision how California

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
will educate its people.

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I believe that everyone here on

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the panel and everyone in the

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:15.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

For our students today. And for

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the students of our future.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

we made in the nineteen sixties

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the accessibility affordability

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and high quality will still

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
assembly select committee on the

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:08.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
master.

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
For higher education

00:06:10.703 --> 00:06:12.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in California. And the series

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:13.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
being recorded and will be

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
available for viewing online on

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the so select committee web page

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:19.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
by as early as tomorrow.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:21.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In nineteen sixty California

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:23.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
developed a visionary plan for

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the future of higher education

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
known as the master plan.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
However much has changed since

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
nineteen sixty.

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Population growth increase

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
student diversity a change in

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
leading industries and their

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
need for talent. As well as in

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the feel of education itself.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Representing Silicon Valley I

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:41.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
see how quickly technology is

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:41.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
advancing along with the rise of

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:42.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
new industry.

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Both have altered student needs

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and boost demand for higher

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:49.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We need a higher education

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
system to respond to a host of

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:52.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
issues never previously

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:54.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
envisioned including the I

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
thought. Or any smartphones.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:57.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
My goal for this select

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
committee is to hold hearings

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
throughout the state. To conduct

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a thorough legislative review to

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:03.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ensure that California has a

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:04.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
master plan and higher edges

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:07.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education system for today and

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:08.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
for tomorrow.

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We need to keep the state's

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:11.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
promised to our students are

00:07:11.798 --> 00:07:13.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
providing and accessible

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
affordable high quality higher

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
education

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:17.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for all California students who

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
qualify.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
The select committee is the

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
first step in a multi year

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
endeavor to update the master

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:24.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
plan.

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:25.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Now I'm coming in with an open

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
mind. And I do not have any

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
preconceived notions or

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:29.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
solutions that encourage my

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
colleagues to do the same.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I do the first two years of the

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
select committee is being the

00:07:34.954 --> 00:07:36.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
information gathering phase

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:37.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
where we hear from all

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
stakeholders and collect as much

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
feedback as we can.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:41.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The select committee held its

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
first hearing the last year on

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:45.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
August thirty first in

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Sacramento where we heard in

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:47.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
over view and status of higher

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education from the legislative

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
analyst's office.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
As well as from the leaders of

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
California's higher education

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
institutions specifically the

00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
community colleges the CSU

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
system the UC system and the

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
association of nonprofit.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Private institutions.

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The second hearing which was

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:05.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
held on November first.

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
I'd seen it they state

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:08.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
university focused on

00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
California's workforce needs.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
At this hearing we heard from

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
academics as well as the

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:15.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
business community about the

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
workforce skills gap never

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:18.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
facing in California.

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:21.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
In addition to today's hearing

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:22.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
plan to hold two more hearings

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:23.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
this year. One in southern

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
California with a focus on the

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:27.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
needs of faculty and staff. And

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
one back in Sacramento to

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
examine cost in funding issues

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
including financial aid.

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
After the conclusion of the

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:35.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hearings the slight committee

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:36.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
was your report. Likely at the

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
end of this year summarizing the

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:40.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hearings as well as recommending

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:42.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the next steps such as what

bipartisan basis and we are very

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:53.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fortunate to have members who

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

Joaquin Arambula.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:06.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And without a to have a look in

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:07.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
my colleagues certainly don't

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
during good.

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:11.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
To say any anywhere is there.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:12.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So I just wanted to say it's so

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:14.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
nice. Back home in my backyard

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for those of you that don't now

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I grew up about a block away

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
from.

00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I live less than half a mile

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:23.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
away from here right now and it

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:24.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
really is nice being at the

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
first City College in our state.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm particularly proud that my

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
colleagues wanted to come in

00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:35.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
here are voices in our
community.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:35.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So often we feel that Sacramento

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:36.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
doesn't hear us

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:40.706 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
but here we are to hear from
you.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Finally like to say that not one

00:10:42.675 --> 00:10:43.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of us who are here on the panel

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:49.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And that as times change so must

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
visions.

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And what our master plan must do

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
is meet our needs of today.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And so look forward to hearing

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
from the students on how we can

00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:58.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I will be focusing a lot

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:56.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
portability questions an

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
enormous problem statewide.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:12:59.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
How young people are being asked

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:01.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to step up and leverage their

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
futures and it to levels that I

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
think previous generations

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
never could have imagined?

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And then exacerbating the cost

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that we're putting on to the

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:11.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the basic cost of education. We

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
don't have all the enormous

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:14.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
housing costs that. Have just

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
gone through the roof everywhere

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:18.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in the state. And it's really

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
becoming enormous challenge the

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
wild thing is that now it ends

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
up that the total cost of

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Is actually tends to be higher

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:29.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
for a a. A low income

00:13:29.108 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
communicable student who doesn't

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:32.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
live at home.

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Verses you see your cal state is

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:35.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
because the least do you see.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:38.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
They've got you know. Decent

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:39.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
wraparound services.

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
No for room and board for low

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:43.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
income students and that of

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:46.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
course doesn't exist. Not in any

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:47.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
kind of robust waiter could be

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:49.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college level so we're we're all

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
facing enormous challenges right

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:52.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
now as we try to think about how

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:53.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
to move forward.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:54.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But I I really do applied.

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:58.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A marketing Joaquin for their

00:13:58.771 --> 00:13:59.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
leadership and I'm I'm looking

00:13:59.371 --> 00:13:59.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for to hearing the testimony

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
today.

00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:03.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Thank you very much senator and

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:03.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
and thank you for your

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:05.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
involvement it's gonna make you

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
as we move from information

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:07.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
gathering stage to that.

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The legislative stages that.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:10.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
In a joint and and close

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
relationship that we have I

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:15.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
think it's gonna make a lot

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:18.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
smoother. On in both houses

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:19.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
really appreciate you taking

00:14:19.325 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
your whole day pretty much out

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:22.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to come and spend with us.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Is a direct flight to LA them

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
to catch leader.

00:14:26.966 --> 00:14:30.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And and so our first panel.

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:34.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Is our do we have a list of.

00:14:34.573 --> 00:14:36.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Perfect and so I think we think

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:37.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the local elected leaders have

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:38.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
been introduced if anybody was

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

recognize you during the
hearing.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Then so we'll move on our first

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
panel which is on affordability.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The total cost of attendance for

00:14:48.988 --> 00:14:49.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
presentation from from Spencer.

00:15:24.857 --> 00:15:26.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Good afternoon.

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Leyva Spencer brand and I am a

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
third year student at UC Santa

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Barbara I had the privilege of

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
being here representing the UC

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
student association.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
System wide advocacy group with

00:15:36.635 --> 00:15:38.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a strong history of campus

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
activism and education policy

00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
advocates he forty two hundred

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
thousand plus undergraduate.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:45.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Graduate and professional you

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:46.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
see students.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It feels good to be here and

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:49.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Fresno because it feels like

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:51.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
home to me too I grew up in the

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.518 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Central Valley as did my
parents.

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And their parents before them.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm cognizant that here in the

00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Central Valley we lag

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
significantly behind the rest of

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:03.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the state in terms of higher

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:03.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:04.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Only thirteen percent of adults

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in my home county have acquired

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
a bachelor's degree.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:09.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
My family is reflective of that

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:10.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
number.

00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:12.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Throughout my childhood and

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
teenage years I can remember my

00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
mother always telling me that

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:17.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
she couldn't wait until I went

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:18.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
away to college.

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Whether that was because she saw

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
potential in me or because she

00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:24.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
saw an XTC major who she wanted

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:25.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to get out of the house. I can't

00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
be completely sure.

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:29.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But more particularly my mother

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
always stressed to me that the

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:31.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
cost of college shouldn't

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
prevent me from pursuing higher

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
degree.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The degree the skills you learn

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are worth it she would tell me.

00:16:38.864 --> 00:16:40.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Occasionally this message came

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:41.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
across as the typical modeler

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
motherly encouragement.

00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And other times I could hear in

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:47.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
her voice that she was trying to

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
tell me something else.

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:49.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Something about her own journey

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
through life that she regretted.

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:52.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Something about the

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:53.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
inaccessibility of college when

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:54.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
she was growing up.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In the financial structure it

00:16:57.015 --> 00:16:57.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
struggles that had limited her

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
options.

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:00.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Despite those odds he had

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:02.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
acquired a degree so I took her

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
advice and applied to the

00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:04.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
schools of my dreams.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
All in the California you

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:07.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
perceive California and CSU

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:08.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
system.

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:10.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I was admitted to UC Santa

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Barbara and quickly decided to

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:14.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
attend what was and is still the

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:15.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
most beautiful campus in the

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:16.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
world.

00:17:16.602 --> 00:17:18.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Upon enrolling at UCSB I quickly

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
learned that the cost of college

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
for students are not confined to

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
the classroom.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:25.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The cost of college includes

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
includes books force readers and

00:17:28.747 --> 00:17:30.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
lab coats housing Hafen in

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:31.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
saturated markets with

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
perpetually rising rents.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:35.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And food and other basic needs

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:36.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
needed to survive.

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Another thing I like for my mom

00:17:39.024 --> 00:17:40.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
a kid twelve teacher for more

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:41.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
than a decade is that academic

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:44.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
success does not begin and and

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
in the classroom.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It extends to every students

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
home environment.

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:49.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I have to make tough decisions

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:50.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
about whether to buy every book

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:52.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that I need for a course. Or to

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:53.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
go to the market in by angry ins

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:54.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
for dinner.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I satellite you're wondering

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:58.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
what it is that I can do to come

00:17:59.011 --> 00:17:59.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
up with those extra few dollars

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:00.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
to pay rent.

00:18:00.646 --> 00:18:03.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I maxed out on the amount

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
student loans I can half.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I can tell you the names of

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
every financial assistance

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
program that we have on campus

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
which ones are grants which ones

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:12.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are loans. Which ones require

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:14.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
proof of an addiction notice

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
before they stepped in with

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:16.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
meager systems.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Because I've been searching for

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
every possible Avenue to pay for

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
these costs.

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:23.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I can also tell you that I know

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:23.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that financial support that

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students receive is going to get

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:26.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
smaller before it gets bigger.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
This is because our segments of

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
higher education in the state

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:32.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are only two pieces in the web

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:33.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of assistance that is provided

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:34.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
to students.

00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:37.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
At the federal level student aid

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:37.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
grant programs have been

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
decimated.

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:41.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In nineteen eighty the be all

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
grant covered seventy seven

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:42.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
percent of the cost of college

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:44.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
attendance.

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Today it covers less than one

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:46.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
third of that cost.

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:48.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Hell is no longer tied to

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:50.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
inflation and uncertainty and

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:52.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
neglect at the federal level

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:54.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
threatens to impose further

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
financial hardship on students.

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:57.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
In addition increased

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
enrollments have impacted the

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:00.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
housing markets is for campuses

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
across the state.

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:03.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
My first year I lived in the

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:04.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
chapel room on campus

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in a dorm that was constructed

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:07.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
around the time that my

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
grandfather was born.

00:19:08.847 --> 00:19:10.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Older friends of mine who had

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:12.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
lived in the same dorm were

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
shocked that room was a closet

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
with two people living in it how

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
do you manage they would say.

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:19.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Needless to say we were eager to

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
move out after the first year of

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
close company.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
This year the last freshman

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
doubles were converted triples

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:27.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
on our campus to accommodate

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
rising enrollment.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:31.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
My roommates and I decided to

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:32.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
move out of the residence halls

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:33.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in in Thailand is set a college

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
town directly adjacent to you

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
see center Barbara. With costs

00:19:36.742 --> 00:19:38.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
were extensively lower. We begin

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
searching for housing coming

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:42.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
academic year during December of

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
our first year school.

00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We quickly quickly realize that

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the only way to find something

00:19:47.085 --> 00:19:49.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
halfway affordable was to find

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:49.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some friends who were going to

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
pack into an apartment like

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
sardines.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:53.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We settled on a group of six men

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
six turned to eight and eight to

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ten.

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are leasing camp company paid us

00:19:59.298 --> 00:19:59.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
no deference and we stop the

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
unit that we've been eyeing to

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:02.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
another group of students

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:05.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
so we added the final two people

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Bataan and signed a lease on the

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
bottom story of a duplex.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
For a grand total of six

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:10.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thousand eight hundred and fifty

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
dollars per month.

00:20:12.844 --> 00:20:14.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Well above the cost estimates

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:16.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
posts on the UC website.

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My parents agreed to split the

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
security deposit my share was

00:20:20.686 --> 00:20:22.988 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
fifteen hundred dollars in
total.

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:23.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Will get about all back I sure

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
them but my friends and I knew

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that I was the landlords are

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:27.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
notorious for getting away with

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:28.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
highway robbery.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Talking thousands and falsely

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
claim damages every year.

00:20:32.965 --> 00:20:35.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Today as far as our land lord

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:36.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
knows we've E. people living in

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
our little blue house.

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:39.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But in reality anywhere from ten

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:41.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to thirteen people are crammed

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
into two bedrooms and one garage

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
on any given night.

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:47.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Some who are additional sub

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Weezer's somewhere France some

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:49.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
more friends that are

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:52.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
experiencing homelessness.

00:20:52.684 --> 00:20:53.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
This student aid I receive this

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
year through cal grant a direct

00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:56.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
federal loans comes to hundred

00:20:56.955 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
fifty dollars short of covering

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.926 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
the cost of my rent each
quarter.

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Needless to say. When I'm not

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
studying I work to make up the

00:21:03.462 --> 00:21:04.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
difference.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:05.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
While the home environment can

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
he cramped loud and overwhelming

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
sometime

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at least I can say that I live

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:09.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
with some good for.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Not all students can say that.

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Kind of firemen can take a toll

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
on our students academic

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
performance.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Cal grant and loans don't cover

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:19.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
the cost of basic needs

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:20.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
either.

00:21:20.846 --> 00:21:23.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
As a freshman with the meal plan

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:24.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I paid almost two thousand a

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
quarter for nutritious and.

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:28.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Paid for by special grant given

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
to first year students.

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:31.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
No but I live off campus I can't

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:32.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
afford be paying ten dollars per

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
meal so I cook for myself as

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
often as I can. And buy food and

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:39.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
other basic necessities at the

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:39.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
market down the street.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The prices they're unfortunately

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:44.503 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
are well above the state
average.

00:21:44.569 --> 00:21:45.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Cal grant does not cover my

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
costs of living or my cost of

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:49.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
education during the summer

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:50.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
months as well even though my

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
lease last year round.

00:21:52.678 --> 00:21:54.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because of the difficulty I have

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
getting into courses I needed

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
began content I need to begin

00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:59.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and continue my major. I pursue

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:00.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
taking classes over the summer.

00:22:00.585 --> 00:22:03.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I can't do this at UC Santa

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Barbara because cal grant does

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:05.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
not extend into the summer.

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:06.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
This leaves in a time crunch to

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:08.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
take out. As many courses is I

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
can't of finish my degree in

00:22:11.296 --> 00:22:13.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
four years. Before my financial

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:14.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
aid runs out.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I had no idea about any of this

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:20.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
before I step foot on campus.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And parents the trial by fire

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:24.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that students know all too well.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:25.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We need a more accurate and

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
transparent assessment of these

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
costs so that they can make some

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students can make the right

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:30.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
financial decisions.

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:34.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Lastly the sleeves of books

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
quirk breeders and other

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:38.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
educational supplies as a third

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:39.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
consistently under prioritize

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:39.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
because.

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:40.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
I and other

00:22:40.092 --> 00:22:40.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
specter

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the price of which are rising

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:43.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
faster than housing or tuition

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:44.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
and fees.

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
These are the true cost of

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:46.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
attendance.

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They go far beyond tuition and

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:49.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
fees

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:51.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students are engaged in the

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:52.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
constant balancing act weighing

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:53.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
their academic attainment

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:53.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
against some of their basic

00:22:53.939 --> 00:22:56.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
needs.

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:57.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In past hearings held by this

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:59.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
committee we've heard about the

00:22:59.311 --> 00:22:59.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
importance of making the

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:00.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
university accessible to all

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
California students.

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:04.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Especially those that are from

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
underrepresented communities

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
including people of color

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
undocumented students students

00:23:09.087 --> 00:23:11.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
for rural communities and

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students with disabilities.

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:15.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
If our state wants to claim the

00:23:15.093 --> 00:23:15.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
mantle of standing for these

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
communities and for a vision of

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
opportunity and social justice.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
This is imperative and if our

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
state wants to meet the needs of

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:23.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
California's a vibrant economy

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:25.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we must increase the number of

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students with degrees and close

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
the degree gap.

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:30.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But we do this by investment

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
first and foremost

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the California public higher

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:34.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education system clearly lacks

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the resources. To accomplish the

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:38.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
major task given rolling born

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
more students without a major

00:23:40.952 --> 00:23:42.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
shift in tone on the part of our

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:43.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
lawmakers an executive branch in

00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:44.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
regard to funding.

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:47.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
If your has its in to believe me

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:48.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
take a look. At the state of our

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:50.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
campuses right now.

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Come visit our classrooms and

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
sit with students in the aisles

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
of lecture halls.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Come.

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Sorry visit our research labs

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and talk to our researchers who

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
work with aging and dilapidated

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
equipment.

00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Caller counseling and

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
psychological services center

00:24:05.243 --> 00:24:05.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
and try to schedule an

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
appointment.

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I can promise you'll wait

00:24:08.547 --> 00:24:11.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
anywhere between a day and week

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:13.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to see a therapist and once you

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:14.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
do follow up visits are

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
scheduled weeks away if at all.

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:17.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Now imagine that these

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:19.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
institutions have been rolled

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:19.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thousands and thousands of more

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:20.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students without adequate

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:22.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
reinvestment.

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:23.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And try to tell me that they are

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:24.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
still the number one public

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
higher education system in the

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:28.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
world.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We must collectively reimagine

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the role of higher education in

00:24:31.903 --> 00:24:34.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
our state.

00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:35.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I believe every resident must

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
have the right to attend college

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
without that without tuition and

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:41.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
without an unbearable cost of

00:24:41.346 --> 00:24:41.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
living.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Students on our campus have high

00:24:43.114 --> 00:24:44.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
hopes in our collective ability

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to produce that long term vision

00:24:46.785 --> 00:24:47.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for public higher education in

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
our state.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Through it all we must look at

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:51.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the student experiences our

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:52.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Guiding Light. Must raise per

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:54.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
student funding in all segments

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
of higher education.

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:57.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Lower the cost of attendance for

00:24:57.495 --> 00:24:58.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students and we must work

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:00.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
together by students workers as

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:03.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
faculty as colleges and is

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:06.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
policymakers to make this vision

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:08.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a reality. I can promise you

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:09.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that students are ready to do

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:09.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
their part.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:16.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Thank you very much Spencer

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Spencer and and some of his

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:20.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
peers.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Came to my office.

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A month month and a half ago.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:25.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To talk with me about their

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
experiences.

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You see S. B. in and how they

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:29.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
really want to be.

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:31.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Constructive part of this

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:32.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
conversation and and

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the patient a day as a huge step

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
in that direction really

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
appreciate that.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The very much and next up we

00:25:37.369 --> 00:25:38.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
have Debbie Cochran vice

college access and success

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:02.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%

Phone.

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:06.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And thank you so much for having

be here with you I'm. The

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:10.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
institute for college access and

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:12.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
success is a non prop up it

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
nonpartisan research and policy

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:16.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
organization based in.

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:17.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Oakland California.

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:18.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
I'm organizations vice

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:19.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
presidents and I also lead it's

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:20.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
California policy in advocacy

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
work.

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I said I would acknowledge right

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
now that I'm gonna go through

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:27.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
some of these lights pretty

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:28.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
quickly I actually pulled the

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
power point together before

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:31.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
writing up what I was going to

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:32.157 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
say about it you realize I
might.

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:32.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Been a little too ambitious.

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:34.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:36.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Bear with me.

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:38.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Are you know I really

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
appreciate this could this

00:26:39.197 --> 00:26:40.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
committee's focus on.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:41.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Making sure that the master

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
plan is meeting the needs of

00:26:43.068 --> 00:26:43.635 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students and starting off with

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:45.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
affordability in particular

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:46.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
because we at TI guess he

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:48.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
affordability. I'm as very

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
critical to both students access

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:52.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to and success in college.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:54.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You know if you can't pay the

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:55.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
tuition bill for college then

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:57.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you can't access college you

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
can't step foot in the door.

00:26:58.783 --> 00:27:00.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But text books transportation

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:03.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
food housing those are all also

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
costs of attendance for college

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
if you only have resources to

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:07.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
cover the tuition melon not

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
those other costs.

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:10.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You can't afford to keep coming

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
back to the classroom day after

00:27:13.064 --> 00:27:13.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
day and week after week you

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:14.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
can't afford to visit the

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:16.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
library or visit the tutoring

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
center or good a professor's

00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:19.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
office hours. So those are the

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
types of costs in this are the

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
types of financial aid that

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:23.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
students need.

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:24.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
See it in college.

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:28.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm as a state when we look at

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the research in the and that.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Day how California compares to

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:32.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the rest the country we see that

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:34.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
California's on a relatively

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
good job with making access to

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:37.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
college affordable.

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:40.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Ya in California young adults

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:41.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are much more likely to enroll

00:27:41.259 --> 00:27:43.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in college than their peers

00:27:43.228 --> 00:27:44.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
nationally.

00:27:45.063 --> 00:27:45.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Our community colleges have the

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lowest tuition in the country

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:49.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and that all of California's

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:50.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
public colleges and universities

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
about half of students attend

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:53.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
tuition free. And that's really

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
because we as a state have long

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
set up our financially policies

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:58.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to make sure that tuition costs

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
aren't a barrier to enrolling.

00:28:00.678 --> 00:28:03.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But the state does not do as

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:03.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
good of a job with supporting

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:06.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students with non tuition costs.

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:07.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The California SUNY commission

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
estimates that for twenty

00:28:09.254 --> 00:28:10.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
thousand seventeen eighteen.

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:13.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Full time student living

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:14.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
independently off campus that's

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that's the way that most college

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:17.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students in California at all

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
three segments lives.

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:21.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
They have on over nineteen

00:28:21.332 --> 00:28:23.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thousand dollars and cost beyond

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:24.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
tuition

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:26.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
so you can see the breakdown on

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:27.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the slide of how those costs

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
shake out of. Over nine thousand

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
dollars in the colleges and

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
estimates for housing costs as

00:28:32.944 --> 00:28:34.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we just heard those caught those

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:35.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
estimates might even be

00:28:35.313 --> 00:28:36.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
realistic.

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:38.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And now my next two slides are

00:28:38.783 --> 00:28:40.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
focused on three public colleges

00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:41.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the Sacramento area and the

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:42.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
demonstrate how much of it.

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:44.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
To look at total college costs

00:28:44.923 --> 00:28:46.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'm as opposed to just tuition.

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:50.895 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
So we look at just tuition
costs.

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:51.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We can see that the community

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:53.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college is by far the least

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
expensive option of that of the

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:56.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
three choices that a Sacramento

00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:58.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
areas you might be faced with.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:59.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I am in fact the cost of

00:28:59.304 --> 00:28:59.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community college that's quite

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:00.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
low.

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:02.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But when we add in non tuition

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:04.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
costs the differences shrink and

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:06.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the entire total costs of

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
attendance for students at all

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
three segments.

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:11.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But much harder at for students

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:12.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
to reach.

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Now these are colleges own

00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
estimates of students costs and

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we took them from colleges net

00:29:17.055 --> 00:29:18.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
price calculators.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I am now the net price of

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:21.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
colleges when it cost students

00:29:21.759 --> 00:29:22.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to actually attend college.

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Full cost of college after

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:27.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
taking out all the grantee

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that's available to students

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'm sorts when they really need

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:31.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to pay after granted no net

00:29:31.236 --> 00:29:33.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
price calculators are consumer

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
tools that are designed. To help

00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:37.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
prospective students and their

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
families understand what is

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:41.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
really going tap it costs for a

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:41.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
student to attend a particular

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:42.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
college.

00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:45.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So we looked at the net price

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
calculators for twenty seven

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:46.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
public colleges.

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:48.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
State.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
All nine of the undergraduate

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:53.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
serving UC's and nearby see.

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:54.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Cao states and community

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:55.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college campuses because we

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:57.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
wanted to see what it costs for

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
low income students to attend

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
each of these schools.

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:01.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Now we focused on low income

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:03.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students by which I mean with

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
family incomes under thirty

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thousand dollars of having come

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
here because analyses of college

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:09.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
affordability across in.

00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:10.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Groups consistently shows that

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:13.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
this is the group that is facing

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:13.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the most burdensome college

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:14.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
costs.

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:17.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
It's also important to note

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:18.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
however that the majority of

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:21.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
African American Latino and give

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:22.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
American students have family

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:23.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
incomes under thirty thousand

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:26.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
dollars.

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:27.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
So looking at net price

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:29.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
calculator as we can see. And

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
review how well you can see that

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:32.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
on that on the screen you can

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:33.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
see that our sample students

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:35.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that we that we looked at that

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
price calculators for would

00:30:36.668 --> 00:30:37.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
receive more than enough granted

00:30:37.368 --> 00:30:37.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to cover their tuition at each

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:38.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
of the.

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:40.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Colleges but they're still left

00:30:40.772 --> 00:30:43.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
with net prices that would

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
require them to borrow loans or

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
work long hours to afford.

00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:47.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
As senator Alan put it so well

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
in his introductory remarks I'm

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in most regions of the state

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
including here and the Central

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:55.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Valley this community colleges

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:55.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
actually be most expensive

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:58.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
option. For students.

00:30:58.823 --> 00:31:01.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Now in twenty sixteen we

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:02.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
surveyed twelve thousand

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:03.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
California community college

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:04.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students about the trade offs

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:06.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that they face in pain for

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:07.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college. And the overwhelmingly

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:10.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
discuss the challenges posed by

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
their non tuition costs.

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:13.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Many students shared stories

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
about their struggles with

00:31:14.906 --> 00:31:15.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
homelessness or near

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
homelessness and pointed out

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
specifically how little

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
financial aid is available to

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:22.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
help students with those costs.

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Students shared stories about

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
having to choose between buying

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:26.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
textbooks and eating.

00:31:26.684 --> 00:31:28.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Many students I have pointed to

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:30.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the cost of textbooks as being

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:33.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
unrealistically high such as two

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:34.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hundred dollars with one student

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
even. Asking very directly how

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
is a low income students

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
supposed to afford this.

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:41.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It was part of this same study

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:43.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we ask students what they are

00:31:43.334 --> 00:31:43.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
likely to do you if they cannot

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:46.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
afford required text.

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
One third of them said that they

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:49.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
would do what they could to pass

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
our forces without the books.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Twenty seven percent said they

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
were likely to drop the course.

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:57.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So this exemplifies how students

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:57.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
when faced with on affordable

00:31:57.815 --> 00:31:58.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
college costs

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:01.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
make choices that influence

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
whether the graduate. In what

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:06.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
amount of time and at what cost.

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.526 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The can borrow student loans

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
which hopefully will be able to

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
pay off once they graduate.

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
They can work the research shows

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that working more than fifteen

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:15.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or twenty hours a week while

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:16.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they're a full time student is

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
detrimental to their success. Or

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
they can come back on enrollment

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:21.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
which puts them at greater risk

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:22.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of not completing.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So when I touch very briefly on

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
each of those issues.

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:27.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In a joint effort with a cow

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
seats you disassociation we

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
recently found that the vast

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
majority of CSU graduates with

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:34.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
student loan debt. Came from

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:35.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
families with incomes of no

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
greater than fifty four thousand

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:37.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
dollars of income.

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:39.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Nearly two thirds came from

00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:41.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
families with incomes less than

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:41.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
twenty fab seven thousand

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:44.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
dollars.

00:32:44.862 --> 00:32:45.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Public data from the university

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of California show very similar

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
trends.

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:49.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
About half of all bachelors

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:50.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
degree graduates with debt from

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:53.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the UC had family incomes less

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
than fifty five thousand dollars

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:56.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in the lowest income students

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
were three times as likely to

00:32:58.543 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
leave with that as the highest

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:00.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
income students. So this is a

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
critically important trend for

00:33:02.947 --> 00:33:03.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
us to understand as we look

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:04.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
towards state policy solutions.

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:06.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That to ensure that a college

00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
education is affordable.

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:11.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Students also worked to cover

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
college costs

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:13.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I met all twenty seven of the

00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:14.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
colleges that you just on that

00:33:15.059 --> 00:33:17.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
map of California. The lowest

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
income students would have to

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
work more than twenty hours a

00:33:20.998 --> 00:33:22.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
week to cover those costs.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
At some colleges in all three of

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the segments they would have to

00:33:25.436 --> 00:33:26.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
work more than thirty hours a

00:33:26.804 --> 00:33:28.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
week this is already went once

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:29.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
you've taken into account the

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
grantee that the billable.

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So needing to spend this much

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:33.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
time working means less time

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
studying.

00:33:34.912 --> 00:33:36.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
No more than any other single

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:39.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
topic that came up in our survey

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:40.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of students students share how

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:42.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
these trade offs for their time

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:43.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
were holding them back

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
academically.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Moving forward to ensure that

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the master plans promise of

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:51.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
educational opportunities

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:51.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
realized we need more and better

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:52.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
and.

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:53.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
It's in the basement

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Julie.

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:57.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We need at to bribe better

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:57.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
recognize and address the total

00:33:57.869 --> 00:33:59.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
costs of college that students

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are facing. And we must ensure

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:02.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that financial aid investments

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are targeted at the students for

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:05.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
whom college costs are the most

00:34:05.476 --> 00:34:07.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
burdensome and for whom.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Barriers to enrollment

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:10.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
completion are most pronounced.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Currently the cal grant program

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:13.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
does that provide some support

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:16.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for students for non tuition.

00:34:16.687 --> 00:34:17.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But hundreds of thousands of

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:19.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eligible students every year are

00:34:19.223 --> 00:34:19.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
turned away from the program

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:20.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
because

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:22.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
enough grants available.

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:24.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A recent high school graduates

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:25.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
who apply for a cal grant me the

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
deadline that they're entitled

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
to a grants.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:29.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But if you're not a recent high

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:31.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
school graduate give to compete

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:33.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in the most recent year see

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sacrifice that over four hundred

00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:36.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
thousand students competed for

00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:39.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
less than twenty six thousand

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
grants.

00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:42.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Most of the students who are

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
turned away without a grant have

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:44.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
income so low that the federal

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:47.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
government estimates they cannot

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:47.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
afford to put a single dollar

00:34:47.685 --> 00:34:48.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
towards our college.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Tions.

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Never the applicants who do

00:34:52.857 --> 00:34:54.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
receive a grant the portion of

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:56.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the cal grants that covers non

00:34:56.894 --> 00:34:58.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
tuition costs has not kept pace.

00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:00.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
It's lost most of its

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:02.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
purchasing power you have the

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
award kept pace with inflation.

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:06.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
It today would be over worth

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
over six thousand five hundred

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:08.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
dollars.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Instead. The maximum award is

00:35:11.075 --> 00:35:11.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
one thousand six hundred seventy

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:12.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
two.

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:15.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Now in recent years the

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:16.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
legislature has created two new

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
financial aid programs to

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:19.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
increase this award for full

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:20.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
time community college students

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in particular in this is very

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:23.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
important progress in the right

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:24.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
direction.

00:35:24.989 --> 00:35:26.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
It is also very important

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
understand that only four

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
percent of California community

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:31.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college students receive the cal

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:33.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
grant upon which these out on

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:34.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
grants are based.

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:36.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So it's important games Gaines

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:37.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
for a very small group of

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:40.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:41.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So I'd like to close some by

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:43.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
sharing finance from one more

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
report that's relevant today to

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
today's conversation.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We recently interviewed twenty

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:49.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
two expert throughout the state

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about their own perceptions of

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:53.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the strains in challenges

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:53.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
related to college affordability

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:54.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
throughout how.

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Among these experts there is

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
resounding consensus that

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
California has a college

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
affordability problem.

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:02.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
In all interviewees agreed that

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:05.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
improving college affordability

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:05.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
means focusing on covering non

00:36:05.763 --> 00:36:06.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
tuition costs

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Many also expressed the

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:11.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
importance of doing more for the

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:12.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
neediest students including

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
nontraditional students under

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:15.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
service use community college

00:36:15.406 --> 00:36:18.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students former foster youth and

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:20.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
other first generation students.

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Experts also recently are also

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
it universally agreed that

00:36:23.648 --> 00:36:24.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
affordability challenges

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
negatively impact students in

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:28.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
several ways.

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:30.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
While student debt burdens rose

00:36:30.955 --> 00:36:31.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
to the top meaning.

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
On affordable college means more

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:35.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Sudan I'm almost equally

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:36.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
concerning to the experts were

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the impacts of affordability

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:38.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
challenges on students

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
enrollment in college their

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ability to get to college or

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
through college in a timely way.

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:46.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
In of course that it contributed

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to equity gaps that we see in

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
college access and completion.

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So within our current state

00:36:52.743 --> 00:36:53.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
financial aid structure the

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
simplest way to make targeted

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
investments to address these

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:57.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
challenges is to increase the

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:58.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
number of cal grants available.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
In increase the size of the

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
grants available to students for

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
non tuition costs.

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:05.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But the experts we with whom we

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:07.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
spoke also underscored the need

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for broader systemic reform.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That we need to also reduce the

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:13.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
complexity of the financial aid

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:13.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
system

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:14.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
we need to correct outdated

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:16.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
assumptions about who today's

00:37:17.001 --> 00:37:18.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
students really are.

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:19.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The legislative analyst's office

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
put out a proposal for

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
financially reform last year.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
The California's you nay

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
commission is considering reform

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
options as we speak so these are

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:29.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
enormously important

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
conversations and we need to get

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:32.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
it rights.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AB implementing reforms will

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:34.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
work I will require both

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
political leadership and

00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:37.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
additional investments

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but the extent of the consensus

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:40.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
around the problem and its

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
implications.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Underscore the costs of inaction

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:50.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
thank you.

00:37:50.568 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Thank you thank you so much W.

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:53.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and I first of the chance to me

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
W. at a higher education

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:55.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
conference

00:37:55.573 --> 00:37:56.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
so in California. And.

00:37:56.974 --> 00:37:59.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But you had a slight three here

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
really stuck with me.

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And I've been repeating it in

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:03.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Frawley bungling it.

00:38:03.547 --> 00:38:05.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
When I've repeated the.

00:38:05.116 --> 00:38:07.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
For the last couple months

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
which is eight for tuition

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:10.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
facilitates access.

00:38:10.888 --> 00:38:12.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But eight for non tuition costs

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:14.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
facilitates college success.

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:15.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And and we're good is it if

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:16.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we're setting students up to to

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:19.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
fail essentially what we're

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:19.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
letting them in but we're not

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:21.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
giving them.

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:21.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
What they need?

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And the financial assistance

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that they need so that they can

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:25.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
really focus on their studies.

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:27.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And and be able to see it and

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
so I really love the way that

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that was freezing really

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
appreciate that I won open of my

00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.679 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
colleagues first doctor

Africa come visit you.

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So I just wanted to recognize

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:38.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
two of the state's center

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:39.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

thank you guys for being.

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:52.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Thank you very much.

Senate Allen Jimmy Y.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
disaffected just part of part of

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the on the cal grant numbers you

00:38:57.068 --> 00:39:00.471 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
disparate raised miss Crocker

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:01.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and if you were talking about

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:01.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
how.

00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:02.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And can we four percent of all

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students get the. The cal grant

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:06.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
be is it is.

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:07.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Could use her flesh that out a

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
bit I mean I it. Presumably.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
You're.

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:13.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Keep his fuss about holiday

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:14.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
because I.

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Recent budget things in my mind.

00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:20.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
You. Have so.

00:39:20.891 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
So about four percent of

00:39:23.027 --> 00:39:24.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
California community college.

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:26.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
They seek help.

00:39:26.897 --> 00:39:30.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Right arm what book but.

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:31.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But but it's a chilly much

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:32.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
higher percentage get some form

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
of financial aid.

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:35.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Yes about forty five percent of

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:36.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students get the fee waiver will

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:38.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we look at full time student

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:39.410 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
assembly almost seventy or

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:40.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
eighty percent of students get

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
a fee waiver.

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:45.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And we get a federal help. For

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:46.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the cal grant program is not not

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:47.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
closely aligned with the

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:50.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
community college who.

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:51.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Students who are.

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:53.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Going to community colleges are

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
off and I'm take

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
they have a gap between high

00:39:55.226 --> 00:39:56.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
school enrollments.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
College and college or if they

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:01.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
do go directly from high school

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to college if often missed the

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:03.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
window maybe they didn't they

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
were not. College preparation

00:40:05.402 --> 00:40:07.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
for.

00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:09.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Right.

00:40:09.173 --> 00:40:11.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So as part of your idea that we

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ought to expand the.

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:14.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Rules of eligibility.

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:16.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
For the government be.

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:18.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Think I think we need to you

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:19.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
know we need to insure that more

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the four hundred thousand

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
applicants who are applying.

00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:24.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Not these recent.

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
It's have an opportunity.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
On Thursday been different

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:28.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
legislative proposals for how to

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that in recent years one is just

00:40:30.828 --> 00:40:33.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
simply to increase the number of

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
grants available. Another option

00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
would be to expand the

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:38.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
entitlement. For all college

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:39.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
grads are all high school

00:40:39.403 --> 00:40:40.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
graduates are to.

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To the few different ways to go

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:44.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but the important thing is that

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:46.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
we go one of those ways.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And if it would you find what it

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:49.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
is that being the.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Close is equivalent to the cal

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
grant be.

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
For those students who are

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:55.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
coming into the cocky because

00:40:55.352 --> 00:40:58.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
system a little later.

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
What would it would their major

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:01.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
sources of financial aid

00:41:01.225 --> 00:41:02.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
typically for not eligible for

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
the? Government be.

00:41:04.728 --> 00:41:07.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Almost all as well the three

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:09.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
major sources of financial aid

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the the three largest sources of

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
financially for California

00:41:12.603 --> 00:41:13.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
community college students. Are

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the federal Pell grants the the

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:17.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
fee waiver now known as the

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
promised.

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:20.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And federal student loans

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:21.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
very few community college

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students actually borrow federal

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
student loans but there is more

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:25.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
aid that goes to students

00:41:25.482 --> 00:41:26.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
through the federal student loan

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:28.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
program. Them through the

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Calgary.

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:34.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
And that the.

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The fee waivers the Bob. Waiver

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:37.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
of heather okay.

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:40.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Great okay thank you.

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:41.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Thank you and I think that's a

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:42.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
good point you know. Caspian to

00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:45.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
this whole effort which back in

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
nineteen sixty the vast majority

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:47.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of our students were students

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
coming straight out of high

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:49.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
school.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And and today in two thousand

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
eighteen with so many more

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
students that are.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You know it worked for a couple

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
years and I than China.

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
A teen degree or.

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You know start a family in are

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
coming back now that their.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Family situations more stable

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:06.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
whatever it is where the holes

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that would set up don't apply to

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:07.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
them.

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Then then so trying to find

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
more creative ways.

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:11.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
To make sure that we're

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
providing.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Financial aid and and support

00:42:14.865 --> 00:42:16.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the today's students as opposed

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:17.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to the students of sixty years

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ago.

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:19.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Is gonna be a really important

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:20.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
conversation that we have.

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:23.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So one quick question that I

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
have.

00:42:24.642 --> 00:42:26.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Maybe for Spencer you or I

00:42:26.977 --> 00:42:31.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
their view is yes but from what

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:31.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you've experienced so you seen.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:32.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
What? Can you may talk about a

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
specific limitations of student

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
aid in covering some of the

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students non tuition costs.

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:39.556 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I think that you can run into if

00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:42.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
any.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Yeah sure well.

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:47.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The the first thing of course is

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:47.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
that when you have.

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:49.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The pool of student navy your

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.001 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
granted from these various

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
source says.

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The first thing it goes to

00:42:55.005 --> 00:42:55.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cover ease your tuition and fees

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:56.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
at university of course.

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Then as a student my user

00:42:58.943 --> 00:43:00.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
experience on this is that I get

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:01.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sent the track or a check or a

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:03.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
direct deposit. In its for

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
whatever the differences.

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:07.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So in between that night sort of

00:43:07.484 --> 00:43:08.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
mention this my.

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Having maxed out on the amount

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of direct federal loans that I

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:14.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
can which Roth.

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:15.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:17.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That amount that I was awarded

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:18.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
time cal grant.

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:22.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Dot still comes up short.

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Even covering the three months

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:25.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
rent reporter that I would have

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:26.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
to pay.

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So obviously that's your biggest

00:43:29.239 --> 00:43:31.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
limitation it's that it's not.

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Meeting the needs um no a of

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
students who are.

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:36.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I finding themselves in in

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
housing markets like this that.

00:43:39.049 --> 00:43:41.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
How I've server patchily rising

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
rents?

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:42.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
But of course.

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:45.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
On talk about you know that

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
leaves no money for.

00:43:46.857 --> 00:43:49.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Your basic needs costs that's

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:50.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
food.

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Are you know basic toiletries.

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:55.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
It's your books.

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Your equipment that you have to

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
buy.

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
For you loud. On your course

00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:01.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
readers.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:01.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I think it's I I really want to

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:04.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
put a.

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:07.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
In in what you said about.

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:10.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The fact that something around

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:11.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
which to tweak combined those

00:44:11.582 --> 00:44:13.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
two segments of students are

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:15.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that would either drop the class

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:17.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
or try to get by in the class

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
without going it buying book.

00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:21.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That's a real the suit decision

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:23.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that students make it certainly

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:23.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
decision that I've made

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I usually err on the side of

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
just hoping I can skate by and

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:27.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
everything worked out.

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But it does hinder my success

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:31.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of course so. These things are

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:34.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
all interconnected.

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:35.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Excellent since the dispenser.

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:40.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
NNW you've got or slide this is

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:41.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
our but the slide of the state

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
that shows.

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Your college costs are for low

00:44:44.948 --> 00:44:45.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
income students across

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:45.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
California and.

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:47.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
In the research that you've

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:47.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
done.

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:44:48.952 --> 00:44:51.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Where's my question is that I

00:44:51.321 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
want to ask.

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:55.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Though he'd dot do not tuition

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
costs of college.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Del you seem to the very across

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
region of me are or something

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:03.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Tyrone one region and lessen

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
another in. May is that should

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
be taken some flexibility into

00:45:06.737 --> 00:45:07.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
account when we're designing the

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:08.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
programs.

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:09.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Do you think.

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:11.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know that's a very it's a very

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
interesting question I think

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:14.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
actually gets back in some ways

00:45:14.845 --> 00:45:15.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to Spencer's through Spenser's

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
points around.

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Cost estimates.

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:19.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Whom he seemed we do this

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
research is often that it

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:21.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
doesn't vary as much as you

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:22.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
think

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:23.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I'm the California sea nay

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
commission has for many years

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:25.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
now

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:26.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
put out.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Annual estimates of what the

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:30.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
non tuition because

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college are so each college has

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:35.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
supporting their at a student

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:35.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
budget an estimate of what it.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
They can either tuition to that

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:38.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and then very there you have

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:39.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
your budget.

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:41.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But it's a statewide estimates

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:44.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
most community colleges in the

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:45.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
state of California use that

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
state.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:47.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So that means Fresno City

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
College probably shows the same

00:45:49.213 --> 00:45:50.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
housing that's.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:51.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
As separate.

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:51.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
IBM's

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:52.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
college.

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:54.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
It's it's hard to imagine

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:57.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
housing costs are the same and

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
those two regions but at the

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
same time. Pulling together.

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:02.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
You know their own esta.

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:04.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Can be time consuming.

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:05.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Administratively.

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
So I think

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
issue nay commission's efforts

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that there did working on right

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:11.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
now to get a better handle on

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
what's.

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:13.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Actually are and how they might

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:14.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
the varying across

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:15.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
across in California incredibly

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:18.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
import.

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:19.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Perfect thank you.

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:22.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And I have a couple dozen other

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:23.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
questions I'd like ask bring

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:23.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that same for the next two

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:24.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
panels.

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:26.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
So really one I think.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:28.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

year I was reading.

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:49.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:53.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
coming straight out of college

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:54.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
can apply for when your

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:55.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
fellowship. In the state

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
legislature and I was reading

00:46:57.181 --> 00:46:58.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
through these resumes and then

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

00:47:01.618 --> 00:47:02.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
shocked.

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
By how many students mentioned

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that they started a food pantry

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
on campus.

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And and the fact that. We have

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:12.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
a need for that many food

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

are not unique to anyone system.

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:19.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
The needs of students to

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
of the state.

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:43.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And the stories I hear on a

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:44.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
regular basis connected to basic

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
needs a truly heartbreaking.

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:49.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'd like to briefly touch on the

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.654 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
topic of privilege.

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:52.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There is a great privilege and

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:56.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
being able to attend college.

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:57.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And my case even work towards a

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
masters degree something that I

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:01.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
never imagined and I was a

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
senior in college and talking to

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
advise and I never been

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
something that. Was painted is

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:06.903 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
that they can be part of my
life.

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We know of the many benefits of

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:10.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that privilege.

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:13.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Opportunities for upward social

00:50:13.243 --> 00:50:15.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
mobility. Access to jobs in

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
industry in this great state.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That privilege of just be able

00:50:19.449 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to pull yourself out a life of

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
poverty during own hard work and

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
determination.

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:25.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
This privilege is a great thing

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:27.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but I think that this narrative

00:50:27.124 --> 00:50:28.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
has in some ways. Hidden

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:29.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
disappears troubles of our

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I state leaders you almost often

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:33.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
care the struggle that your

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:35.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
constituents based on a regular

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:36.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
basis.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
People who are chronically

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
homeless people who are sick and

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:40.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
disabled struggling to pay their

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
extremely expensive hospital

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
bills.

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Single parent struggling to work

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.645 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
and take care for young
children.

00:50:48.712 --> 00:50:50.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
School teachers working in

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:51.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
challenging classrooms not being

00:50:51.648 --> 00:50:54.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
paid are supported enough.

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:55.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
These challenges are

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:56.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
overwhelming to the individuals

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
into the state. And sometimes

00:50:58.688 --> 00:50:59.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm sure it may seem that the

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
struggles of a college student

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:02.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'm not as great as those other

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
concerns.

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:05.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
However while there is great

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:07.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
privilege and healing a college

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:09.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
degree. The path to get there

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:10.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
can be as challenging as any.

00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:12.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And if the student lacks access

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
to their basic needs.

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Food housing mental health

00:51:15.305 --> 00:51:16.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
resources they have a larger

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
likely had of struggling in

00:51:18.909 --> 00:51:20.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college dropping out before

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:21.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
completion and leaving the

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
institution with that but no

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
degree.

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:27.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
With that being said I'd like to

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
break these issue at.

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And address them one at a time.

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:31.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
But there's that student

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:32.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
security be heard for years

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about the struggle that students

00:51:34.658 --> 00:51:35.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
sometimes space to feed

00:51:35.158 --> 00:51:36.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
themselves.

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
A few years ago this issue

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
became such a priority that we

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:42.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
began to see both a suit

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:43.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
associated students

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
organizations on campus since.

00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:47.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And even campus leadership like

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:47.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that Fresno state.

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Begin to address these issues by

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:52.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
opening food pantries on campus.

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:53.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Since then many different

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:55.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
tactics have begun to utilize on

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:58.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
our campuses in the CSU. And you

00:51:58.782 --> 00:51:59.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
get to hear about many of them I

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:01.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
am Sir at from doctor needs

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:03.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
badly at the director of student

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
while this the basic needs

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
initiative as well as other

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
representatives from the
systems.

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Just a few weeks ago the CSU

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:11.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
released their system my basic

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:13.029 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
needs are part and the findings

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:14.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
were very Graham.

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
It was reported that nearly two

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hundred thousand CSU students

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
face some form of food

00:52:21.204 --> 00:52:22.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
insecurity.

00:52:22.739 --> 00:52:24.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Those numbers are staggering.

00:52:24.741 --> 00:52:26.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I think the assumption is that

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:27.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the college experience should be

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:28.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
a struggle.

00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:31.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Everyone struggles in college so

00:52:31.147 --> 00:52:32.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I to this generation be any

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
different are we just too soft.

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:36.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
We just can't handle it.

00:52:36.653 --> 00:52:38.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I like to think that the

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:39.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
struggle we reference ought to

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:41.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
be. Connected academic records

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:42.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
of the program.

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:44.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
That mental and emotional

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:47.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
development that occurs when you

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sit in a classroom surrounded by

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:49.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
diverge Spock an opinion on the

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:50.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
subject.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Not whether or not someone's

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:53.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
able to access officially

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
nutritious food to get

00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
themselves through the day.

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:59.276 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The impacts of the issue thirds

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:00.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
insecurity should be obvious.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:01.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But also should not go without

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:04.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
saying.

00:53:04.714 --> 00:53:05.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Students have trouble feeding

00:53:05.315 --> 00:53:07.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
themselves apart having more

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:08.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
trouble in class.

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
This prayer is critical because

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:11.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
system wide and statewide there

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:12.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
continues to be a per she it

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:13.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
seems that finish line of

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:16.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
graduation even more quickly.

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:18.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And while great work is being

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:19.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
done to achieve this goal higher

00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:21.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
graduation rates. If we're not

00:53:21.131 --> 00:53:23.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
addressing our students basic

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:32.943 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
needs the issue of food
insecurity is

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:36.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
obviously widespread. But it

00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:37.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cuts differently among different

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
student groups.

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:42.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Los systemwide forty one point

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:45.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
six percent and CSU students

00:53:45.088 --> 00:53:46.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
report some form of food

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:48.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
insecurity. Forty one point six

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:49.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
percent across the system.

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:50.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Sixty five point nine percent of

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:52.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
black first generation college

00:53:52.929 --> 00:53:53.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
students reported food

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:54.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
insecurity.

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:59.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'll say it again almost seventy

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
percent.

A black first generation

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students in the CSU based and

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:06.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
security.

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:07.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Among our students are

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:10.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
classified as underserved. Their

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
rates of food insecurity or mean

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:14.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
higher than the average.

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:15.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
This means that as we continue

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to address this issue. The work

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
must be done intentionally and

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with the state's dedication to

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:24.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
equity at the forefront.

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
And the to homelessness

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
unfortunately CSU students have

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
not remained unscathed. From

00:54:31.001 --> 00:54:31.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
this state right affordable

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:32.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
housing crisis.

00:54:32.736 --> 00:54:35.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Before getting into what we know

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:35.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
about the CS use how much

00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:37.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students I want to tell a brief

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:38.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
story.

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:39.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Last week very close to here

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Fresno state.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:45.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CSA along with assembly members

00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:46.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

At delta pilot program to

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:52.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
address student homelessness.

00:54:52.756 --> 00:54:55.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
For the president we want what's

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:56.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Fresno state student leaders to

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:57.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
identify students what

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
experience homelessness.

00:54:58.762 --> 00:54:59.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
To speak in support at the press

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:00.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
conference.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:01.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
There student leaders tried for

00:55:01.598 --> 00:55:03.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
weeks to find someone willing to

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
speak about their experiences at

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:06.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
public events. It became close

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
multiple times with multiple

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:10.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students identified as homeless.

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:11.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
But no student out of many

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:13.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
identified were willing to come

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
forward and tell their story.

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:15.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The stigma of homelessness

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:16.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
remains strong. And is no

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:17.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
different for our students.

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:19.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And fortunately far too many of

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:20.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
our CSU students do experience

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:21.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
homelessness.

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:22.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Ten point nine percent of

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students system wide but fifty

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:24.821 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
two thousand students in the
CSU.

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Reported being homeless sometime

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
within the last year.

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:31.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And again our African American

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:32.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
first generation students

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
reported higher than average

00:55:34.664 --> 00:55:36.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
numbers and eighteen percent.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I probably don't have to tell

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:40.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you that when you're homeless.

00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:42.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Turning in that paper on time.

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:45.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Attending class or office hours

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:46.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and participating in high impact

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:47.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
practices and programs is

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
probably the very last thing on

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
your mind.

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:53.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The issue of homelessness in

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:54.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
general and student homelessness

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
specifically. Remains such a

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:58.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
challenging issue debate because

00:55:58.988 --> 00:55:59.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
they're so feel low cost

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:02.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
solutions.

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Well with food and security

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:05.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
meeting the number of

00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:06.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
advancements from partnerships

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:07.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
with county food banks to

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
donations from community members

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:11.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to bring students to calabash

00:56:11.201 --> 00:56:12.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
benefits.

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:14.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Those types of low cost options

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:15.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
don't really exist when it comes

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to providing a safe and stable

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
home environment.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:19.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Campus housing is not really a

00:56:19.509 --> 00:56:20.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
solution from a students.

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:21.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Because on many campuses the

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:23.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
prices near the local cost of

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
housing or may even be higher.

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:27.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And in most cases there are not

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
many vacancies in campus housing

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:31.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to serve best into the up

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
homeless throughout the
semester.

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:35.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
With few campus based solutions

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:37.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
available aye how much students

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
joined countless number and

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:39.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
other people who are homeless in

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:40.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
this state.

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Praying for additional solutions

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:43.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and resources to solve this

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
issue.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:47.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I do want to mention that we

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:50.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have seen many campuses sat at

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
struggling with homelessness.

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:53.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Many campuses have created small

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:56.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
amounts of emergency short term

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
housing to help shelter our

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
neediest students.

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But for many reasons this is

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
merely a bandaid.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A good bandaid but a bandaid

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
nonetheless.

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:07.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
While we know that many college

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
age youth who are homeless seek

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:10.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
shelter for safety. And

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
emergency short term housing

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:13.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
solutions off our students at

00:57:13.396 --> 00:57:16.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
least that temporary safety.

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:17.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
They're not proven methods to

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
keep that image was permanently

00:57:19.202 --> 00:57:20.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
housed.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:21.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
This takes us time last issue of

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:22.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the portion mental health.

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:25.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
All of these issues seem to

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
relate to one another.

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:27.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
After all they're having trouble

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:29.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
finding housing it probably also

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:30.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
struggling to feed yourself.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And it experiencing homelessness

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and our food insecurity you're

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:37.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
totally have troubles with your

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
mental health as you deal with

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:39.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that daily trauma.

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:40.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Of course there are other

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:41.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
factors that contribute to

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
mental health challenges to.

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:46.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
They. Of the college studies.

00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:47.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Their immigration status and the

00:57:47.363 --> 00:57:48.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
national climate.

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:51.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And the personal issues with

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
family friends romantic
partners.

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
These factors are all linked and

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:56.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
layered.

00:57:56.806 --> 00:57:57.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In addition cultural stigmas

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
make it a challenge to even come

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:01.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
forward. When one has a mental

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
health issue.

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I've heard from CSU students at

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:05.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
southeast Asian background for

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
example who carries significant

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:10.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
cultural stickman. In seeking

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:11.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
help with respect their mental

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:11.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
health.

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:12.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
This type of statement only

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:14.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
compounds the issue of mental

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
health for the students.

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:17.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And other to explain similar

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
issues in their communities and

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:20.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
households.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:21.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Stands up front tired for the

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
past two years to try to expand

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:24.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
mental health resources on

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:27.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
campuses but unfortunately we

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:28.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
have not been successful enough.

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:29.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
We know that the national

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
standard for mental health

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:32.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
counselors on the college campus

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:34.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is one mental health counselor

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
per fifteen hundred students.

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:39.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
However only thirteen ever

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:39.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
twenty three campuses have

00:58:39.949 --> 00:58:41.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
anything close to one hundred

00:58:41.084 --> 00:58:42.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
that range.

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
At some campuses the radio is

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:45.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
much higher.

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:48.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
At Fresno state San Francisco

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:49.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
saying how stay LA.

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The ratio is one counselor to

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:51.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
more than three thousand

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:54.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:55.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
These ratios mean on many

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:57.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
campuses to deal with a lack of

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
mental health counselors

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:01.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students report wait times up to

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:01.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
a month.

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:04.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
To see a counselor in person.

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:05.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
There's often a cap on their

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
visits throughout the year.

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That means that if I go and I

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:10.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
put my name on the list they

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:11.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
call me in three or four weeks I

00:59:11.614 --> 00:59:13.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
go see a counselor. And I make a

00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
connection with this person I

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:16.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
finally filled I can open up and

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:17.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
speak about my difficulties.

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:19.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That person have returned to me

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:20.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and say I'm sorry I can only see

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
you six more times this year.

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:23.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And I care for you to an outside

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:26.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
clinic.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:27.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
If you can get the

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:27.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
transportation to get there

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:28.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
never insurance covers it.

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:32.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
That's unacceptable.

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:35.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
No student when they have found

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the courage to come forward.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:37.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And acknowledge their mental

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
health issues.

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Should have to wait so long.

00:59:40.743 --> 00:59:42.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
About a lack of access the help

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:43.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that they need to be safe and

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:46.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
successful on their campus.

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Lastly on this topic on our

00:59:48.818 --> 00:59:49.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
campuses student fees are being

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:51.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
used to pay for these mental

00:59:51.354 --> 00:59:52.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
health resources.

00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
This means that the most obvious

00:59:54.991 --> 00:59:56.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
way to expand these needed

00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
resources on campus is to

00:59:58.695 --> 00:59:59.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
increase the if campus based

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
feels.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
But this only compounds the

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cycle of affordability in mental

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
health challenges.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Students are struggling with

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
food costs housing costs.

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And rising tuition and fees.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:11.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
If the only solution with

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
respect mental health is to

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
exacerbate another issue that is

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
not an acceptable solution.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I want to thank all of you for

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:19.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
allowing me to speak to you

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:22.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
today on this critical issue is.

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:24.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I also want to thank the other

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
senior representatives who are

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:25.488 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
here.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Speaking today on the issues of

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
equity in student success on the

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
total cost of attendance.

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:31.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
All these issues are intertwined

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:33.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and I feel so privileged to work

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:34.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
alongside you to represent all

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
California college students and

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:38.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
trying to solve these issues. In

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:39.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
partnership with our ski

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
institutional leaders think you

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:46.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
very much.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Thank you very much Maggie and.

01:00:49.012 --> 01:00:49.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Nagy mentioned that you know

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:52.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
maybe it's.

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:53.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We just this younger generation

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:55.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that's soft and can't presume

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Maggie that you were born.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:58.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
In nineteen ninety eight or

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
before. Alright so Maggie and I

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
are both members of the same

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:03.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
generation both members of the

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
millennial generation.

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We've created millennial caucus

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
in the state legislature.

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:09.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And for fear of offending most

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
the people in here of.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
For the men on for the

college of of undergrad students

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:19.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

its current generation what

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
recovery because all.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Generation social media that's

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we're gonna going. I know what

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:25.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
is it.

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Senate generation Z. it it is

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hard to get into college it's

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
harder to graduate in four five

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
years aye costs more to attend.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And and graduates are graduating

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:35.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
with more student debt.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Than ever before.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:40.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And so I I I die I can't you

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
put incredibly eloquently.

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:44.734 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Really appreciate you doing
that.

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Before we Bonta ten the alkaline

01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:47.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
no I just want to.

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Introduce my my colleague and

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
friend Jose Medina.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Summer Medina is chair of the

01:01:52.975 --> 01:01:53.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
assembly.

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:55.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Higher Education Committee and

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:57.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
is been working with me on the

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
the master plan.

The select committee on the

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
master plan for higher education

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
when I first approach Mr Medina

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:04.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about this I said the I'll I'm

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
interested in compromising the

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
master plan that if it takes. I

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:10.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
just got elected if it takes ten

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
or twelve years that's how long

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
it's gonna take. A and Mr Medina

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
said I turn out in eight years

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:18.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
let's do a before that.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
So is so we've.

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
You know.

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'd spend of the time frame a

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:28.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
little bit but missed Medina one

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:29.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to give you a chance you once

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:32.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
introductory comments or.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:33.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Perfect.

01:02:33.216 --> 01:02:36.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Thought like introduced him

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:38.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Delano Tim is.

Yeah I'm the upper the

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:52.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
generation of technology that

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:54.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
I'm working on a.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:55.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
The open.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Because there.

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Using a map to the PC world as.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:02:59.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
His new an ambitious.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:04.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
But okay.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:05.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So thank you selectivity members

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
an attendee is.

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
It's an honor to participate in

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this timely panel on hearing

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:11.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
assuring that the California

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:13.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
higher education master plan

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
meets the needs of students

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
across the state. Both two year

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.961 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
and four year public and
private.

01:03:19.028 --> 01:03:19.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I have my brief remarks will

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
contribute to your understanding

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of the basic needs challenges

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:24.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
facing students today. As well

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:25.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as what we're doing across the

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
university of California and our

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:30.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
partners to advance solutions.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So I myself have a communicable

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:33.476 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
as graduate I get CD UC Santa

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Cruz I return to school after a

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
few years works thirty eight

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
hours and. No the Santa Barbara

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cue muted thirty miles to school

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
so I I get a sense of this and

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:45.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
really appreciate this work and

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:45.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I'm in it for the long haul

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
homeless when it as well as many

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:49.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of us that go through our public

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:49.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
education system.

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So I just want extend that eight

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:51.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
dollars to the university of

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
California at self as I begin to

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
really look at it as a system I

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:56.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
mean a comprises over two

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.801 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
hundred thirty thousand
students.

01:03:58.868 --> 01:03:59.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
A hundred fifty academic

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
disciplines six hundred graduate

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
degree programs a ten campuses

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
serving undergraduates graduate

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:06.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and professional students.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So has being data basic needs we

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:09.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have to think about those three

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
student populations and how

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we're developing and responding

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to of all of their needs.

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:15.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So a clear challenge in higher

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
education today is the impact

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the cost of attendance we've

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:19.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
heard that from Spencer and

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:22.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Debbie. As well so today's

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
expenses are other than tuition

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:25.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they count for more than sixty

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent of the total cost of

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:27.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
attending a college and

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:28.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
university.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And over the last four decades

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the cost of living for college

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students has increased by over

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:34.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
eighty percent.

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Peter I next senior research

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:37.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
economist of the federal reserve

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
best summed up the struggle for

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:39.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:40.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In relation to the number of

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hours they need to work to cover

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
the cost of attendance.

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So thirty five hours a week you

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
know compared is a few decades

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ago is factored in that you can

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:49.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
succeed as a student and work

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ten hours.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So we need to account for that

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:53.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and think about how we're being

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
responsive to that change in

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:56.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
trend in it's alarming

01:04:57.026 --> 01:04:58.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
implications.

01:04:58.861 --> 01:04:59.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So that means older generations

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
regular pay for much more than

01:05:00.963 --> 01:05:03.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
lentils. As past wages now today

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:04.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cover only one third of the cost

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of attendance.

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:07.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Further the institute because

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
success in.

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:12.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That access is S. T. guests.

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:13.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I noted in their work because

01:05:13.276 --> 01:05:14.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
because for low income

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:15.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Californians that it would take

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
up to thirty seven hours a week

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
at the high end for students.

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:20.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To cover the cost of attendance

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
at the receive no financial aid

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and had to cover all their

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
expenses by working.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
So the increased cost of

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
attendance do affect student and

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
food and housing security.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Cordon the USDA food security is

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
measured by identifying food

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
secure.

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Low in very low food security.

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:41.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So low food security is a factor

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
of equality in very low's a

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
factor of quantities who just to

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:46.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
break that down for folks. And

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
food insecurity itself.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Is defined as a limited on

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
certain availability.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Actually adequate and see foods

01:05:52.682 --> 01:05:53.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
with the ability to acquire such

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
foods in a socially acceptable

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
manner.

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So the question sets in the U.

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:01.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
S. D. designed to assess. The

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
validity of food security are

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eighteen tener six item question

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sets that are used nationally.

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:08.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So to start with understanding

01:06:08.964 --> 01:06:10.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
family food security through

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:11.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
census data we find that

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
families across the U. S.. On

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:15.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
average are suffering fourteen

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent low in very low food

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:18.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
insecurity combined.

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:19.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Soon look at studies in higher

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:21.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
education the results are

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:21.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
noticeably.

01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:26.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
More significant.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So between two thousand nine and

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:29.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
two thousand sixteen there a

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
total of nine studies in the

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:31.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
problems of food insecurity in

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:32.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
college campuses.

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:34.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
With an average food insecurity

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:35.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of loan very low totaling forty

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
eight percent.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:40.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So there's a signal right there

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:41.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that there's something up I

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
guess you'd call Canary very

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
bright a Canary do tend to. And

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on often security was assessed

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:47.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
in less than ten thousand

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
students

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:49.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at that time which is very low

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:51.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
compared to the expected twenty

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
million college students.

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:54.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Projected by the national center

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for education statistics as a

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fall twenty thousand fifteen.

01:06:58.914 --> 01:06:59.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So my colleagues who speak to a

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:02.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
broader national community

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:02.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
studies.

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Con committee colleges from

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:05.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hope lab at Temple University

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
shortly.

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:07.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But I'm hoping that is giving

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the context the national

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
landscape in the studies we can

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:11.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
then begin to look in the

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
California and what we're

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:16.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
learning here.

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:17.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So with these challenges the

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:17.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
data points in mind the

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:19.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
university of California has

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
committed to drawing upon campus

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:22.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and systemwide leadership.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To advance upstream approach to

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
addressing student basic needs.

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:27.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So through president Apollo Tana

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
those national global food

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:30.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
initiative launched in twenty

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thirteen revert to line existing

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:35.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
student support services and

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:35.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
programs within a food access

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and basic needs framework.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I initial efforts sought to

01:07:39.054 --> 01:07:41.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
reach the skill of needed to

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:42.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
develop and implement and assess

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
intervention is to address

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:44.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
student food insecurity. As well

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
as begin to better understand

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:47.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the housing and homelessness

01:07:47.463 --> 01:07:48.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
dimensions of basic needs for

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:51.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So from twenty fifteen to twenty

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:53.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
eighteen we've senator efforts

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
across research.

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Prevention and support. Advocacy

01:07:56.872 --> 01:07:58.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
collaboration an overall

01:07:58.974 --> 01:07:59.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
sustainability which I'll speak

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
to you all today.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So the university of California

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:04.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
begin examining the issue of

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:05.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
food insecurity and twenty

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
fifteen starting with the

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:07.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
student food access and security

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
survey.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:11.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Funded by president apartado is

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:12.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
part of the global food

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
initiative effort.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:15.458 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
To increase the response rate we

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
use the national college

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:17.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
assessment survey that is

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
already set to be administered

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
on for UC campuses.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And the remaining six campuses

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the UC institutional research

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and academic planning division

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
administered what we call the

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
got food survey.

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:29.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
These two surveys were

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
administered online in spring

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:31.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
twenty fifteen to a random

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
sample of more than sixty six

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:34.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
thousand students.

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Across ten campuses.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Of those asked a participe eight

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:39.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eight eighty nine hundred thirty

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:40.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
two undergraduate students and

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
graduate students responded.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And as you can see our initial

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:45.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
finding it found that forty two

01:08:45.688 --> 01:08:46.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
percent of students who are low

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
in very low food insecure.

01:08:48.757 --> 01:08:50.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I miss other key findings that

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:52.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
can be reviewed in the survey

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:52.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
results.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Share the member is an online

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:55.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
hopefully with the materials

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:58.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
from the session.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
From that the university of

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
California's food security study

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
inform the decision to revise

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
our institutional assessment

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
measures.

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:07.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So these measures include the UC

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:09.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
undergrad experience survey the

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:11.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
graduate wellbeing survey the

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:12.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
undergraduate cost of attendance

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
as well as a graduate cost of

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
attendance survey.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:17.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So with that a twenty sixteen

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
twenty seventeen was oppressive

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
year for search advancement on

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
our basic needs efforts.

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:23.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
By improving and expanding the

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:24.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
cost of attendance survey for

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
undergraduates.

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:27.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And launching for the first time

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:27.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ever costs of attend

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
survey.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:31.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
In addition for quality of

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:31.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
studies about.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Basic.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:35.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
He did.

Survey team also.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Thirteen homelessness

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:50.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
it's into their surveys.

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:51.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Upon this larger interest and

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
attention to the issue.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Attempting to be respond.

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To help our efforts be more

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
specific with the data

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:00.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in the research to inform who

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:01.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are best serving. And so it was

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:02.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Reyes around particular

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:03.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
demographic identities combined

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:04.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
have increased.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Neither food security housing a

01:10:07.202 --> 01:10:09.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
security homelessness so that

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:11.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
level three data as part of the

01:10:11.106 --> 01:10:13.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
results on that we don't time to

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:13.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
speak about today but it does

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:15.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
inform how we're. Serving the

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
most at risk populations is a

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:20.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
priority in our solutions.

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:23.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
So forty four percent of

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
undergraduate and in twenty six

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
percent project students

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:26.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
reported having experienced food

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
insecurity.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Which is in line with their

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:30.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
twenty fifteen findings of forty

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
eight and twenty five percent

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
respectively so what we do those

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:35.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
questions as we brought from

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:37.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
eighty nine hundred students to

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:38.901 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
over sixty six thousand
students.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:39.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Which serves the database for

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:40.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
undergraduate graduate students

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to research an informant engage

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:43.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
this really timely issue basic

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:46.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
needs.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:47.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So are prevention and support in

group's to better assess student

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
needs.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:57.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
How are campus level as well as

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:58.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to inform system wide efforts?

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
In recognizing there's a growing

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
concern around student food

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
security president Paul Tano

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:05.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
allocated seventy five thousand

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:06.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
per campus to address the

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:08.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
immediate challenges of ensuring

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:09.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
student access to nutritious

01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:10.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

Kaneto from UC Berkeley

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:16.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
developed a multi year strategic

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:17.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
plan with our campus leadership.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The NPI study of twenty fifteen

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:21.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and formed efforts to improve

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:22.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'm just very briefly on one

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
additional support just looking

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:35.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at the aid the UC provides our

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
students complemented by cal

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:38.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
grant in the federal aid. We're

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
trying to provide the best

what our students are struggling

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:45.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
and so I'd really and

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
compassionate connect with the

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:48.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

conferences and meetings to

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
build a network of higher

education aware of the

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:06.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
possibilities to change the

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:07.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
struggles of our students and

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:10.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
make solutions possible for all.

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And strengthen the partnership's

homeless you services at our

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
sister sectors. Which I have to

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
give credit to it's so exciting

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to be on a panel with Colleen

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:21.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
into these. A we've had

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
strategic engagement to really

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:25.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
think about what we can do

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:25.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
across our sectors of the

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:26.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
response of. In the three areas

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
are developing a basic he's

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
vision together and higher at.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:31.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Building a proactive come

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:33.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
communication engagement system

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
which can help inform pending

01:14:35.103 --> 01:14:36.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
policy and other elements that

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:37.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
come up. As well as sharing

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
institutional research and

01:14:38.841 --> 01:14:41.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
analysis to ensure that were.

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:41.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Better asking the questions in

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
one form how we help our

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:43.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students succeed from one system

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:44.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
to the next.

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In going forward you see our

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
model really is to flip the

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:51.119 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
pantry at the bottom. That's a

01:14:51.186 --> 01:14:52.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
crisis resolution are proactive

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:53.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
work these to go before they

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:55.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
come to college whether it's at

01:14:55.123 --> 01:14:56.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a communicative stated you see.

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:58.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Our early outreach programs need

01:14:59.027 --> 01:14:59.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to understand basic needs

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:01.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
financially literacy how to

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
understand housing rental

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
markets and what independence

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
means the student as you come

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
into your own. Sense of identity

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:08.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and growth in the university

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:10.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
system. And then work on the

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:11.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
campus level resources which we

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
are practically doing sewer

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:14.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
working herself up

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:15.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the pyramid into law it will be

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
launched in the next phase of

Thank you for this opportunity

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:45.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to share some work that's being

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
done across our twenty three

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:48.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
campuses to help students who

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:49.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
experience challenges with basic

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:52.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
needs. Particularly food and

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:53.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
housing and security.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:55.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Food in housing in security

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
impacts many California college

01:16:57.012 --> 01:16:58.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Just as it affects countless

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
communities across the nation.

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A recently released national

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:05.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
study found that forty eight

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
percent of student respondents

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:08.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
reported food insecurity within

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:11.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the previous thirty days. And

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:13.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
those of those sixty four

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:14.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
percent also in support it

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
experiencing some level of

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
housing and security.

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And twenty fifteen the CSU

commission of phase one snapshot

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
study of a small student

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
population that found that

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:26.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
approximately. One in five

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students experienced food

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
insecurity while one in twelve

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
experience housing insecurity.

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:36.685 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We recently completed phase two.

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:37.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A more robust first of a kind

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:40.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

in February twenty eighteen

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:42.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
which confirmed my much of the

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:46.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
data from the snapshot study.

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I know most everyone here is

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

campuses have taken to address

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
these concerns head on and

more to be done. And look for to

01:24:18.987 --> 01:24:20.722 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

my work buckets include food.

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:27.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Housing. Mental health self

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:28.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
foster youth homelessness out.

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:32.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
For our students so. It's AB fab

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
pretty tall charge but I'm very

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:36.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
excited that our office.

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:37.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Pacific we hired someone to work

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:40.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
on these issues.

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:41.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
I'm first.

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:41.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Time that I'm aware of that

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
there's been someone designated

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
to work on these issues.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:49.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So a little bit about our system

01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:51.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we are seventy two districts a

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:53.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
hundred and fourteen colleges

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and we serve two point three

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:56.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
million students.

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:57.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I think it is noteworthy

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that out of that total student

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
population two thirds are

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:04.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
considered part time students.

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Meaning they're taking less

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
than twelve units and these

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students are often adult working

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
adults students.

01:26:12.734 --> 01:26:14.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I their parenting students.

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Their students that are working

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
multiple jobs to make ends meet.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
And we also have a

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:21.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
demographically very diverse

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
student body.

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:26.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I in two thousand seventeen our

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
board of governors.

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:30.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Adopted formally adopted a new

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:34.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
vision for success.

01:26:34.956 --> 01:26:36.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For our system. Listed on this

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:38.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
slide are the metrics

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that are driving that new vision

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:41.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
for success I won't go into

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:43.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
great detail but I have provided

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:43.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
a link.

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
About each of these metrics and

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:47.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the time frames established for

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:52.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this new vision for success.

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Bob. And I want to shift to talk

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
a little bit about basic need

01:26:56.778 --> 01:26:58.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
data that we know nationally and

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
at the state level.

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
We.

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:06.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So nationally of the Wisconsin

01:27:06.688 --> 01:27:08.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hope lab conducted a survey in

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:09.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
two thousand seventeen.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That survey included seventy

01:27:11.292 --> 01:27:13.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
community colleges across the

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:13.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
country.

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:16.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We had fourteen California

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:19.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community colleges participate

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:19.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in that survey. And the data

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:20.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
shows that two and three

thirteen. To fourteen percent

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:34.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
report being homeless.

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:35.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And while we do not have

01:27:35.216 --> 01:27:36.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
statewide data that reflects the

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:40.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community college student body

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:41.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
one of our larger districts Los

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:42.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Angeles community college

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:45.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

Wisconsin hope lab. Up pulled

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:49.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Ste almost six thousand of their

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:51.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:56.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
reporting housing insecure. And

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:58.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a whopping almost nineteen

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
percent of the students in the

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:01.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Los Angeles community college

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:03.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
district report being homeless

01:28:03.211 --> 01:28:05.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
which to me is quite staggering.

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:06.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Especially given the fact that

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
generally speaking we don't have

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
housing resources in the

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:11.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
community college system.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:14.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We have eleven districts that

01:28:14.756 --> 01:28:15.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
offer housing resources a. On

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:16.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
campus dorms.

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:20.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
So this this.

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:22.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
A rise in awareness about these

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:23.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
issues.

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Is a call to action for our

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
office and also for the others

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:29.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
segments. I'm we conducted a

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
basic needs survey across our

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:33.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
campuses asking faculty staff

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:34.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and administrators what kind of

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
resources were available to

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:38.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
college students to help meet

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
their basic needs.

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:42.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We have. A hundred and five

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
responses two hundred and thirty

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:46.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
nine individual respondents.

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:48.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And this is what they told us

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:50.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
about food pantries a sixty

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
eight percent reported having

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:53.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
food pantries on campus.

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:56.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Sixty almost sixty two percent

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
reported having support for cow

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
freshen Roman on campus.

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And almost sixty one percent

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:03.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
reported other available food

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:04.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
resources including meal

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
vouchers grocery gift cards

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
farming farmers market products.

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:11.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And so you might ask how are we

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
funding these efforts there.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Generally speaking there are

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:17.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
not designated resources to

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:19.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
address the basic needs for

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
community college students.

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Unfortunately for us and as

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Denise alluded to we got to a

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:27.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
half million dollars of one time

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:27.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
funds.

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:30.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
On for food security activities

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:32.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
on our campuses we also received

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:33.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a one time apportionment for a

01:29:33.501 --> 01:29:35.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
foreign half million dollars for

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:36.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
mental health services.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And I'll talk a little bit more

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:39.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
toward the end of my

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:41.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
presentation about what we're

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:41.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
doing around mental health

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:42.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
services.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
But I want to jump into the

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:46.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hunger free campus activities.

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
These funds were allocated to

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:52.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
support that either creating or

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:54.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
expanding your campus paid food.

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:56.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Campus based food pantries. And

01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:57.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
also ensuring that students have

01:29:57.658 --> 01:29:59.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
information about how fresh but

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:01.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fits I'm all of the community

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:03.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
colleges that are willing to

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:03.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
facilitate these two activities

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:06.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are eligible to get these funds.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In preparation for this work

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:10.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
our office of hosted eleven

01:30:10.972 --> 01:30:11.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
regional cow freshen Roman

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
training.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Trainings across the state we

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:17.245 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
had eighty to community
colleges.

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:19.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Faculty staff and administrators

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to these trainings we reached

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:23.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
over five hundred with a day

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:26.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
long training with the goal of.

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Training faculty and staff

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:29.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
about the application process

01:30:29.357 --> 01:30:31.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and what are the barriers

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:32.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students typically experience.

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:33.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:36.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The demand was overwhelming we

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:37.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
would like to additional

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
trainings but there was such a

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:42.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hunger across our system. From

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
faculty staff and administrators

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:45.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to understand what are the

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:46.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
barriers that students are

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:48.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
experiencing when applying for

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
cal French because it's not just

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:52.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
as direct as.

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:53.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Filling out an application

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:55.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
there's multiple steps and

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:56.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
there's bond lots of things that

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the students need to do to

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
actually access the benefits.

01:31:00.922 --> 01:31:02.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'm we are also offering

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

the colleges.

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:15.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
We have joined our sister

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:27.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
the system and from the

01:31:27.448 --> 01:31:29.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
community colleges themselves to

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:30.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
work on these issues.

01:31:30.852 --> 01:31:33.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We work with external partners

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:35.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
including the department of

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:38.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
We have a blossoming

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
relationship with CSU Chico on

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:43.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I'm getting some federal

outreach activities on campus

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:48.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and that's new to our system.

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:49.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Some were very excited be

01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:51.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And so I wanna switch back a

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:01.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
little bit and talk about mental

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:01.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
health services and what we're

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:04.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
doing in that effort. And I

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:06.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
would say when I was listening

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to the folks talk about the

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.658 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
ratio of mental health
providers.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:15.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
To student. Us stood numbers.

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:16.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Who generally speaking we have

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
maybe one two or three

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
practitioners at the outer most?

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To serve thirty forty fifty

01:32:23.137 --> 01:32:25.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thousand students stone there is

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:26.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
a real need I think the

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
legislature.

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:30.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I recognize that and included

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
some funding some one time

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:33.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
funding.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But we have very very limited

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:38.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
resources to support many many

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:40.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
students who have.

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
S. and depression anxiety thank

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:43.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
you.

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:44.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So we had for a half million

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:48.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
dollars now we facilitate a

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
request for application process

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:52.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
were in the process of approving

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:54.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
those.

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:56.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
Now.

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:58.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The goals of that are to.

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Provide direct services to train

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:03.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
faculty and staff and to help

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
colleges get connected with

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:04.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
their county governments I'm

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:05.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
sorry the county behavioral

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:08.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
health.

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
There's a few statewide.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:11.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
System resources that our

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
office is sponsoring we have ag

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:15.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a suicide prevention gatekeeper

01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:16.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
training them that we've had.

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:18.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Available to the community

01:33:18.993 --> 01:33:20.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges for about six years.

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:23.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
We've got I'm there's three

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:24.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
student facing modules and three

01:33:25.066 --> 01:33:26.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
faculty staff facing modules. To

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:29.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
date we've trained almost

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
seventy thousand people.

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:31.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
We are.

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:32.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Collaborating with an

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:33.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
organization a national

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
organization called the crisis

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
text line. Home where they

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:38.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
provide tax base mental health

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
services we created tool kits

01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:42.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and hopefully any community

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:44.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college that you go to. You will

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:46.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
see these incredible posters and

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
business cards and that key

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
change in. The any kind of

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:51.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
collateral material to let

01:33:51.625 --> 01:33:52.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students know about the service

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
it's a free service.

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:56.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And so far we have just under

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
two thousand students who have

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
access this service we're very

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:02.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
proud of the relationship with

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:03.571 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
crisis text line. And then

01:34:03.637 --> 01:34:06.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
finally we are working with our

01:34:06.841 --> 01:34:08.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
health services association and

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
our online education initiative

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and we're developing student

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:15.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
facing modules in canvas which

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:16.884 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
is our online education
platform.

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And this is just a small sample

01:34:19.086 --> 01:34:20.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
of the topics so why student

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:23.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
logs into their canvas account.

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And what there is to get their

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:25.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grades or whether it's to get.

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:28.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Any of the materials and or to

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
even access our classes. Out

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:33.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they will see a list of about

01:34:33.134 --> 01:34:33.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
twenty five or thirty.

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:37.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Modules that really that delve

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:37.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
into all of the things.

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That could be impeding their

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
academic progress so those are.

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:44.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Absent system wide resources

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:45.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that we're very proud of home

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
given the limitations on what we

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
have to work with.

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
So there's my contact

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:51.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
information thank you very much

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:52.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
for the opportunity to speak

01:34:52.987 --> 01:34:53.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
with you and thank you to the

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:54.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:56.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm it it takes a lot of courage

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:57.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to come up and talk in front of

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:58.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
this group.

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:04.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Great.

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Thank you very much Colleen.

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And with a look at open my

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:09.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
colleagues for any questions or

01:35:09.236 --> 01:35:14.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
comments about how.

01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:16.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Doctor metal. Church.

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:18.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I would feel remiss not to

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
humble brag a little bit about

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:23.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Fresno state and the work that

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:25.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Mary Castro of our First Lady

01:35:25.252 --> 01:35:25.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
has done.

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:28.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It shows the true need that we

01:35:28.923 --> 01:35:31.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have within our Valley and it

01:35:31.092 --> 01:35:31.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
reminds me of a quote from says

01:35:31.759 --> 01:35:32.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
search office.

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:35.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That he finds it ironic that we

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
pick fruits and vegetables to

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:39.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
fill others table to such

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
abundance.

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:41.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And yet have so little left for

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:42.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
ourselves.

01:35:42.803 --> 01:35:44.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Growing up here in the Central

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:47.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Valley in the breadbasket of the

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:48.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
world it's.

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:50.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Truly a shame.

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:53.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That our Fresno state students

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:53.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
have such great need.

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:55.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
In the past eighteen months

01:35:55.082 --> 01:35:56.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
alone they've used that food

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
pantry fifty thousand times.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:01.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And it shows we as a state have

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:01.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a responsibility to try to help

01:36:01.922 --> 01:36:02.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
out.

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:06.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
As the budget sub chair of

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:07.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
subcommittee one I oversee the

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
cal fresh.

01:36:09.029 --> 01:36:10.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Department and wanted to ask a

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:14.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
question about that if I could.

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I wanted took follow up and

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:17.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
understand if there were

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
specific improvements on

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
functionality. Could we help to

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
improve. This government service

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:24.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and make it more accessible for

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:27.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
our students and if we can

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:29.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
follow up after the fact and

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:30.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have specific recommendations

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:32.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and ideas. On how to do that I'd

01:36:32.786 --> 01:36:34.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
like to. There is a bipartisan

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
group right now that are working

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:38.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to make improvements with and

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:39.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
cal fresh both to increase

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:40.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
benefits.

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:41.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But also to make it work better

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:42.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
for communities.

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:45.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So with that I just wanted to

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
say thank you for your testimony

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:48.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
and.

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:49.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And appreciate what you brought

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:52.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
today.

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Thank you doctor regular.

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:57.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Senate Allen well I just wanna

01:36:57.077 --> 01:37:00.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
first of all appreciate the

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
extraordinary work that has been

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
described to me it you know.

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:05.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You know with with limited

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:06.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
resources.

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:09.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Seems like all three the systems

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:09.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are stepping up and trying their

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
best to you to figure out ways

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to address some of these you

01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:13.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
know pretty unnerving challenges

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
that exist.

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:17.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
With our students and and you

01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:19.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
know there's certainly a lot of

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:19.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
work to be done and and a lot of

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:20.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
gaps in the

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:21.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
estimates were very ably

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:22.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
described by. Her to student

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:25.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
speakers out but but I I am I'm

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:27.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
glad to see that systems

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:27.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
stepping up and taking this

01:37:27.942 --> 01:37:30.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
issue very seriously. I will say

01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:31.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
yeah I've seen ninety white.

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:32.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:34.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
As. I'm sure that you get to me

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:35.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
she's coming testified a couple

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
times both the their house of

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:37.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
the budget sub.

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:37:38.852 --> 01:37:40.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm certainly hoping that. By

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:42.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the time I turn out of the

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:43.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Senate I will see her in the

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
legislature. Because she really

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
has been a tremendous student

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:48.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
leader both at the board level

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:50.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and also I'm as president Acosta

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:51.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
conference states dudes

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:51.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
association and I.

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:54.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
I.

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:56.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I think you have office and. I

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:57.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
think you get any so I hope to

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:58.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
hope to see you join us

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:00.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
and I wanted to ask Mr.

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:03.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Gallagher no I'm just one quick

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
question about the food security

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
data a when you mention that

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:08.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
forty two percent of the

01:38:08.749 --> 01:38:10.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
California you see students are.

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:11.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Food insecure. There's another

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:13.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
line in your side that says

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:14.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
child history food security is a

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:17.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
twenty three percent is that to

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:18.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
mean. That. I'm.

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
That twenty three percent of the

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:22.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students in the UC system.

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Experience three in security

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:25.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
before they got college when

01:38:25.466 --> 01:38:26.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
they were when their kid.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Correct in that it's and it's

01:38:29.236 --> 01:38:30.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
beyond that so it's not just

01:38:30.971 --> 01:38:31.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
limited resource students that

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
come from all different sectors

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they may choose to. Have a same

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:36.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
gender partner the family rights

01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:39.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
them off or you have a different

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:39.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
life decision that then cuts

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
them off of him fast for their

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
still dependent.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:43.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm the lower finding is that

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they're all forms of insecurity

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that just not does not directly

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
correlated child food security.

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And so we have a lot more data

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and with eight minutes I could

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:52.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
only share so much. So could

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have been effectively. So you

01:38:54.928 --> 01:38:57.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are you. So that this part of

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:57.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the point you're making here is

01:38:57.898 --> 01:39:00.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
that.

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
That out of those you see of the

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:04.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
other students who are food

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:05.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
insecure.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:09.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You note nearly half of a for

01:39:09.510 --> 01:39:10.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
nearly half of its is actually

01:39:10.844 --> 01:39:12.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
relatively new experience I

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
think yes yeah I heard. In the

01:39:14.915 --> 01:39:15.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
both very difficult things to

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:17.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have gone through for sure but

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:19.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and and and both going to

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
present their own challenges.

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
That's correct.

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And in the idea is that.

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:24.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.627 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
That.

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:28.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
You know the user that there for

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the that the folks who were not

01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:31.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
food secure but now are when

01:39:31.532 --> 01:39:31.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
they get

01:39:31.765 --> 01:39:34.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
school. That you know because

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:35.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the basic their parents of kind

01:39:35.336 --> 01:39:36.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of said Hey you're eighteen now

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:37.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you're off in college you're

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:39.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
taking care yourself and they

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:40.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
don't have the resources to.

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:42.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Correct the other struggles real

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
for them and.

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The free college basic needs

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
literacy is nonexistent we don't

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:50.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have the capacity currently kid

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:51.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to twelve prepare students.

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:54.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So that they have no inclination

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:55.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of where to go or what to do was

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:56.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
our first you know commitment

01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:58.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
was to get the communication.

01:39:58.926 --> 01:40:00.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Centralize the resources and.

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:01.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Let students know that we're

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:02.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
here for them.

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:05.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Okay I appreciate that that's

01:40:05.199 --> 01:40:06.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
very interesting.

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:08.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Then you Mister Allen.

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
It.

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:14.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:15.275 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I is one question I had one

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:15.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
comment that one question one

01:40:15.943 --> 01:40:16.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
comment is.

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
I really appreciated.

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:20.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
You know folks are talking

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:21.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
about. Mental health needs.

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:23.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And and I've been focusing are

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
presented

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:25.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a district and some communities

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:26.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of really struggled with you've

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
mental health issues.

01:40:28.989 --> 01:40:29.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And we focus a lot on high

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:30.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
school students and junior high

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:33.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
school students.

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:33.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But it but as I think about it

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:35.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
we with it too.

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:36.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Youth suicide cluster the past

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
eight years.

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:39.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And in both of those who is

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
also some recent graduates of

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:41.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
high school.

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:43.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Ends and so college students

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:44.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and so we're gonna and work with

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
my staff to figure out if we can

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:47.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
integrate.

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:50.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
De the higher education systems

01:40:50.677 --> 01:40:51.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
into some the work that we've

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:52.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
been doing.

01:40:52.813 --> 01:40:53.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And the work they were doing

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:53.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
this year.

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:55.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
If.

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:58.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You can give them what they.

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:00.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A bunch of you are really all

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:01.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you you know I had that certain

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:02.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
recommendations are or alluded

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:05.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to problems and and I can guess

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:05.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what the recommendations would

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
be but. If you just give us one

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:09.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
or two recommendations of either

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:11.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
changes to the master plan or

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
things that the legislature can

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
do. To address.

01:41:14.935 --> 01:41:15.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The issues that you're either

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:17.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
facing personally as students or

01:41:17.304 --> 01:41:18.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
seeing as administrators on

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:24.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
campus what would those be.

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:25.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Thank you so much that question

01:41:25.512 --> 01:41:26.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I really appreciate that.

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And and you know there's there's

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:29.516 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
twenty floating around my brain

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:29.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
very.

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:30.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Alternative very quickly

01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:32.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
to.

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:35.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Amulets doctor badly was it

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:36.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
three million that the systems.

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:38.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Receive just recently five is

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:39.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
two point five million

01:41:39.326 --> 01:41:41.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I think having earmarked funds

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
and for our schools around

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
mental health counselling. And

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:47.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it can't be for every single

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
campus particularly in my case

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
was yes he's missed ten campuses

01:41:50.971 --> 01:41:53.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that don't have. That ratio gap

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the one fifteen hundred I'm I'm

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
looking at those Fresno state

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:57.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
house LA San Francisco state.

01:41:57.578 --> 01:42:00.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And looking at those schools and

01:42:00.681 --> 01:42:01.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
trying to it as a very first at

01:42:01.381 --> 01:42:03.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
getting those ratios from one

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:05.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
counselor to three thousand more

01:42:05.185 --> 01:42:05.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students to at least one to

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:06.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fifteen hundred. I think that

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:11.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
makes a real difference. I think

01:42:11.091 --> 01:42:11.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the campus says that have

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:12.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
already done an amazing job

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:15.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
advertising those services been

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:18.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they get overwhelmed we don't

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:20.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have the resources to back at.

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:21.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And I think this generation what

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:22.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
something that's amazing about

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:23.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
assets or myself in there.

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Were a lot more willing to talk

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:25.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
about our problems.

01:42:25.539 --> 01:42:27.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And maybe that's due to social

01:42:27.074 --> 01:42:27.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
media we feel that we can really

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:28.675 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
put things out there and see
how.

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:30.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But if we get to that point we

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:31.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
were seeking help and were in a

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:32.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
way rejected.

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:33.514 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I think that has long lasting

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:34.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
consequences for the individual

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:36.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
law.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:37.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And so making sure that the

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:39.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
campus says can have their

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:39.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
sources to back up those

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
promises a basic needs and

01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:42.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
particularly and.

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
For mental health counselors on

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:46.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
those impacted campus says.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:48.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And frankly I I know that

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:49.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
there's been a lot of attention

01:42:49.563 --> 01:42:52.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to. To the food pantries on to

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:53.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
become says I keep referencing

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Fresno state factually meet we

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
just as of last week. And I had

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:59.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a chance to tour the food pantry

01:42:59.072 --> 01:42:59.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
and it was.

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:00.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Fantastic I know they're going

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:01.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to use some of that money that

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:03.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that was just received recently.

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
To put an more refrigeration

01:43:05.045 --> 01:43:06.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
units.

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:08.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
More shelving work more produce.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:09.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And I walked in and I saw

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:13.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So freely using it without

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
embarrassed and or anything like

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
that just.

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Shopping through the aisles for

01:43:18.759 --> 01:43:20.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
for produce for bread.

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:22.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I would love to see that scale

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:24.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
on every single campus

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:25.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
but if you have a chance against

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:27.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
absolutely fantastic it's just

01:43:27.167 --> 01:43:28.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
committee that his one people

01:43:28.902 --> 01:43:30.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
who runs it. Along with did

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:32.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
marry Castro. And just absolute

01:43:32.606 --> 01:43:33.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
dedication everything from the

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:34.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
campus.

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:36.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To make this something that

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
isn't stigmatize isn't all.

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:39.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You can go any time and I was

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:40.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
going to question your means

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:43.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
testing of do you really dead.

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:43.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I know that campus based banking

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:44.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the legislature can do a lot to

01:43:44.918 --> 01:43:47.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
encourage that and define the in

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:48.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a sustainable way seven keep

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:50.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
that going first.

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:52.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You're much. Noticed briefly

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:55.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
share think adding basic needs

01:43:55.128 --> 01:43:55.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
the master plan with clear

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:57.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
metrics that work within the

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:58.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
interstate all sector and the

01:43:58.966 --> 01:43:59.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
legislature so that we can

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:01.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
evaluate the measure report and

01:44:01.435 --> 01:44:02.603 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
work together.

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:03.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Really exciting and I think

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
really timely for this

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:06.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
generation of work because of

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the scope of the problem.

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:09.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
There's mental health in this

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
food housing security you don't

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:11.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
know which one will show first

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of how to support a student. But

01:44:13.013 --> 01:44:14.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we need to align the resources

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:15.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and think about the dotted lines

01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:17.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to really connect in between

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:19.052 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
those services. In our system
so.

01:44:19.119 --> 01:44:21.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
On the second element would be

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
considering the types of policy

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that can intercept across these

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:26.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SP five is great for the housing

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:28.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
or the food specifically. We

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:29.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
brought housing that we've

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
connected mental health so to be

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
exciting to see what kind of

01:44:33.133 --> 01:44:33.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
path for be have.

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:34.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
With that as well so thank you

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:38.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
for asking that question extent.

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
I agree with.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Everyone spoken so far I would

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:43.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
say to adds that is definitely

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:44.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
the Caltrans.

01:44:44.745 --> 01:44:47.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Program an opening that up so

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:47.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
that there is.

01:44:47.414 --> 01:44:48.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:44:48.749 --> 01:44:50.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Less red tape and hoops for

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:52.886 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
students to have to jump
through.

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:53.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Specifically the twenty hour

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:55.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
work week rule is it's tough for

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
a lot of students.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:58.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Especially those who are and

01:44:58.959 --> 01:44:59.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
medical.

01:44:59.226 --> 01:45:01.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Have medical.

01:45:01.294 --> 01:45:04.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
At medical school or having to

01:45:04.798 --> 01:45:05.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
do internships or things like

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:06.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that they're not able to work

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:09.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
those twenty hours so. They're

01:45:09.069 --> 01:45:09.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they're you know there's a lot

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:12.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of red tape around that I'm the

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:13.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
only thing I would add is.

01:45:13.273 --> 01:45:15.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Maybe some legislation around

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
affordable housing around

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:17.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
campuses.

01:45:17.444 --> 01:45:20.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And even with some of our

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:22.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
campuses and in and around

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:23.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
campus is doing new construction

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:25.318 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
maybe having something in the

01:45:25.385 --> 01:45:26.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
contract that speaks to.

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:28.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Providing affordable housing

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
units for students.

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:31.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Matter hereby campuses.

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
The Germans.

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:36.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
There's.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:37.297 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
I think that.

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:40.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Sustaining the allegations that

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:41.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have been made to the systems

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for food security is something

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:45.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that would be very useful and we

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
see an incredible growth across

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:48.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the community college system.

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Updates of colleges really

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:51.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
putting together robust food

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:52.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
pantries.

01:45:52.946 --> 01:45:55.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I would also see that the.

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:56.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Now how service act fund and

01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:01.021 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
this is sort of a one off but
it.

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:01.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Mental health services is

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:04.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
really an issue for our students

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:05.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
and for our system.

01:46:05.192 --> 01:46:07.027 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
I think I know there's

01:46:07.094 --> 01:46:08.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
currently a bill that.

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Speaks to using mental health

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:12.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
service act funds for in higher

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:15.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
education I think that
certainly.

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:15.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Worth.

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:16.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Investigating further and

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:19.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
supporting. Them the department

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:21.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of health care services also has

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:22.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a project that has primarily

01:46:22.976 --> 01:46:24.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
been targeted to K. twelve

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:26.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
students for many years.

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Called local education agency

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:31.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and it is a program that allows

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the K. twelve system to bill

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:33.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
medi cal.

01:46:33.587 --> 01:46:35.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For mental health and physical

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:38.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
health services were working

01:46:38.658 --> 01:46:39.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
with the department health care

01:46:39.326 --> 01:46:40.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
services but I'm not sure if it

01:46:40.927 --> 01:46:42.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
could possibly take a number of

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:44.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
years to get.

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:46.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The regulations modified.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:48.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To allow community colleges

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:49.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that was a bill that allowed

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:50.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
community colleges back in two

01:46:51.004 --> 01:46:52.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
thousand fifteen. To begin up

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:55.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
filling the LA a medi cal

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:57.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
billing program. But there some

01:46:57.410 --> 01:47:01.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
regulatory up barriers to making

01:47:01.081 --> 01:47:01.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that happen and we currently

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:02.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
have.

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:04.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
All fifteen community colleges

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:07.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that are interested to start

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:07.687 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
billing and.

01:47:07.754 --> 01:47:09.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
We have some regulatory

01:47:09.256 --> 01:47:11.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
barriers to be able to do that.

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:15.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I wouldn't love to follow up if

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I could on the mental health

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:17.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
services act.

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Have quite a bit of questions

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
about that as well as the

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:21.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
commission and.

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:23.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Just want to make sure it's

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:24.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
working for our communities.

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:27.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
It's just good governance for us

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:27.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
to look at.

01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:29.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In particular looking at cal

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:31.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fresh there is an opportunity

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
this year I'm going to be

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:33.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
working with another assembly

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:34.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
member on try

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:36.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
figure out how to streamline.

01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:38.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The application and make it work

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:39.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
better for so would love to

01:47:39.586 --> 01:47:42.722 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
follow up on both of those
ideas.

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Thank you Sanam doing the I want

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to buy mentioned executive a lot

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:49.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
higher and people here. Today

01:47:49.196 --> 01:47:49.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
and I am a.

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:51.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You knew we had we had a little

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:52.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
bit of a chat about this at the

01:47:52.933 --> 01:47:53.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
used roundtable and present the

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:54.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Poltava came.

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:57.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I know you brought up the issue

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:58.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
of of for a housing your

01:47:58.772 --> 01:47:59.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
campuses and of course one of

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:01.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
things we're looking at even in

01:48:01.074 --> 01:48:01.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
the context of today's

01:48:01.575 --> 01:48:02.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
discussion is that they're just

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:03.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
very different.

01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:04.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Communities

01:48:04.978 --> 01:48:05.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
where we have campuses manner

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:06.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
some.

01:48:07.013 --> 01:48:09.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Where that the housing? Where

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
that the land costs the

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:12.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
development costs are are

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:13.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
relatively well least by

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
California standards?

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:15.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And then you got places like I

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:17.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
la Vista that was mentioned

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:19.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
before by UC Santa Barbara the

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:22.863 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
in the area around Westwood
UCLA.

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Yeah Berkeley and it there just

01:48:24.898 --> 01:48:27.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
just out of control costs that

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:27.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are really really tough and I

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:28.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
was just really struck by the

01:48:28.435 --> 01:48:29.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students comments about having a

01:48:29.236 --> 01:48:31.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
pac twelve people into a two

01:48:31.238 --> 01:48:33.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
bedroom. Apartment is

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:33.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
unbelievable.

01:48:33.573 --> 01:48:36.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm. Like the old tenants of.

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
The Laurie side. I.

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:41.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But when they I should mention

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
is it did in those communities.

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
It is proven to be very

01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:45.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
difficult for ride variety of

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:47.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
reasons to do development.

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:49.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:48:49.155 --> 01:48:50.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And you know that's really

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:52.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
something that the that the

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:53.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
legislature's looking at.

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:48:54.761 --> 01:48:56.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But the campuses themselves in

01:48:56.796 --> 01:48:58.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the foot three key systems and

01:48:58.798 --> 01:48:59.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
actually have a lot of

01:48:59.299 --> 01:49:01.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
discretion was are a lot more

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:01.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
discretion.

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:04.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A lot more power over the land

01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:05.538 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
use decisions the construction

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:06.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
decisions on their own camps is

01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:08.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
it enough feel that way. When

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
you've gone through. The.

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:11.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The headaches of trying to

01:49:11.578 --> 01:49:13.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
build and additional student

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
housing on campus.

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:14.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:49:15.048 --> 01:49:17.250 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because of all the pressures you

01:49:17.317 --> 01:49:18.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
get from the neighborhood and

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:19.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the community but but you know

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:22.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
as a matter of law the campuses

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:23.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
have a lot more power to do what

01:49:23.590 --> 01:49:24.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
they want on their.

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:26.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
Land

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.662 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
then any other type of
developer.

01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:28.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:30.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:31.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So you know as hard as it may

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:34.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
feel to do that sort of

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:35.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
development it's harder do a.

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:37.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Sometimes off campus and I think

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:40.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I really courage the campuses to

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:41.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
be bald and and.

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:42.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
And

01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:44.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in assessing and addressing.

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:45.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Their housing needs.

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:49.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You know on their own land I

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:50.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
will sell I just the other day I

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:51.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
was out. Of the van the

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:52.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
brilliance of Berkeley the

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
chancellor Berkeley keen on the

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:55.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Los Angeles to talk about what

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:56.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
was happening as person actually

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ask a question about student

01:49:57.590 --> 01:49:58.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
housing.

01:49:58.858 --> 01:49:59.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Cost because it has become such

01:49:59.492 --> 01:50:00.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
a big problem and

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the chancellor announced them

01:50:02.829 --> 01:50:03.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they're going to be doing a lot

01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:04.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
of work.

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:06.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
Pushing forward with

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:09.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
student housing on various plots

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:10.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of land that they have around.

01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:12.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And the Berkeley campus.

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:15.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

01:52:37.817 --> 01:52:40.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
jump out of several classes ID

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:41.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
two conflicting work schedules

01:52:41.287 --> 01:52:42.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
as well as.

01:52:42.689 --> 01:52:42.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
You know.

01:52:42.956 --> 01:52:44.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:52:44.991 --> 01:52:45.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Don't think through three part

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:47.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
time jobs at a time and in doing

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:48.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that now continuously try to

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
balance that on a daily basis.

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:51.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I never would have match

01:52:51.397 --> 01:52:53.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
myself maybe justice matters

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:54.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
specifically having to drop a

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
communication sixty class three

01:52:56.970 --> 01:52:57.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
separate times because those

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:59.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
counted on me.

01:52:59.105 --> 01:52:59.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
De to just conflicting

01:52:59.639 --> 01:53:01.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
schedules and class

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:02.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
cancellations and.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:03.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I most certainly would never

01:53:03.409 --> 01:53:04.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thought four years from now

01:53:04.744 --> 01:53:06.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
earlier that I would be here at

01:53:06.779 --> 01:53:07.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Fresno City call speaking to you

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
all. About some issues in

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
regards to soon equity in

01:53:11.050 --> 01:53:12.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
academic success.

01:53:12.819 --> 01:53:14.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm so this should be a it's a

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:15.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
surprise to some of you but the

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.290 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
time would you colleges being a

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:17.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
two year institution is no

01:53:17.891 --> 01:53:18.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
longer.

01:53:18.825 --> 01:53:20.660 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
The case.

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:20.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
You know.

01:53:21.027 --> 01:53:23.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Glazer Frazier how the chance

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:24.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
office is that sixty seven

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:25.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent of students actually

01:53:25.598 --> 01:53:28.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
graduate or receive their any

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:29.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
type of degree within two years.

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:31.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
In fact the practice of

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students taking longer than two

01:53:32.705 --> 01:53:33.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
years is so embedded into our

01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:35.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
system that a lot of our data

01:53:35.441 --> 01:53:36.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Ste track students and six your

01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:39.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
cohorts. Not giving up enough

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:40.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm to be reactionary and really

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:41.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
giving us a sense of what we

01:53:41.514 --> 01:53:44.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
imagine Camino college students

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:45.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to be right six year students.

01:53:45.451 --> 01:53:46.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:53:46.953 --> 01:53:49.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So bingo myself ring from allow

01:53:49.122 --> 01:53:49.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
American background I sometimes

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:50.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
he was so caught between two

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:52.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
worlds right. Semi Hispanic

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:54.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
culture we value education at

01:53:54.894 --> 01:53:55.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
any level but for many reasons a

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:57.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
lot of our lot of my people do

01:53:57.330 --> 01:53:58.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
not complete or even attempt any

01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
type of higher education a lot

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:02.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
you know it's not.

01:54:03.002 --> 01:54:03.570 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
How my mother and father never

01:54:03.636 --> 01:54:04.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
had the opportunity to attend

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:05.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
high school let alone a middle

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:07.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
school?

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:07.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
They're busy immigrating over

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and joining immediately into the

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:10.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
work force to fight for

01:54:11.044 --> 01:54:11.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
themselves and their family that

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:12.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
was to come.

01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:15.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And whenever I valley's Mexican

01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:16.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
so visits and heroes asking how

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:17.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
schools going in for the most

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:18.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
part exotic and spending any

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:21.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
time at all in my higher

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:21.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
education journey.

01:54:21.554 --> 01:54:22.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:25.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We also value the commitment to

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:25.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
hard work.

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Adult thing that thought has

01:54:27.393 --> 01:54:28.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ever occurred so I Perrance I

01:54:28.928 --> 01:54:30.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
would never be able to not work

01:54:30.797 --> 01:54:31.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
while attending college. There's

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:33.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
never that's never occurred to

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:34.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
them whether my sister graduated

01:54:34.901 --> 01:54:35.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from you see your seats you.

01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That you can only commit to

01:54:37.103 --> 01:54:38.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
school they have the mentality

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that you can you have to work

01:54:40.807 --> 01:54:41.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
while attending college in

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that's a lot of the culture that

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:44.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we come from right. We have to

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:45.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
have a commitment.

01:54:45.445 --> 01:54:46.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:47.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
On the contrary so friends of

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
different a brings up the

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:49.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
question how my decisions to

01:54:49.482 --> 01:54:51.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
take a year off for my decision

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Steven work while attending

01:54:52.986 --> 01:54:55.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college right. They bring up the

01:54:55.255 --> 01:54:57.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
question about what ifs what if

01:54:57.190 --> 01:54:57.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I decided to go into university

01:54:57.890 --> 01:55:00.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
which had the option to do from

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:02.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
three at a high school. On the

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:03.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
opposite suggestions that maybe

01:55:03.463 --> 01:55:05.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
should stop working as much or

01:55:05.164 --> 01:55:08.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
even all together. Or they ask

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:09.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
me don't take any breaks in

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
between are just push through.

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:11.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And as much as I'd like to see

01:55:11.904 --> 01:55:13.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
how my tener five year plan is.

01:55:13.473 --> 01:55:14.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Like already implant mapped out

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:17.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
is the reality is that things

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:17.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
don't work out the way I planned

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:18.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
them to things to work out for

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:21.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
students with the plan

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
themselves to do as well.

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:22.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And yes it shows the focusing on

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
my education if I really truly

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:25.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
wish to be successful maybe I'm

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:27.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
spending too much time working

01:55:27.153 --> 01:55:29.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
maybe I'm spending too much

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:29.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
trying to trying to earn some

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:30.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
money and not focusing on my

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
degree. But there should be some

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
form of balance a balance

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:35.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ratchet still be able to fill my

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:37.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
cultural and work

01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:37.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
responsibilities while attending

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:38.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
school.

01:55:38.898 --> 01:55:39.365 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And they will be able to

01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:41.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
complete those within two and

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:41.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
three years I am.

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:44.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So what's holding students back.

01:55:44.804 --> 01:55:45.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Is it the remediation are basic

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:47.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
skills that sets students up

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:48.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
immediately in a position where

01:55:48.875 --> 01:55:49.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
they have no other option but to

01:55:49.575 --> 01:55:51.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
finish a sequence of course that

01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
can easily take two or three

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:53.379 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
years just to even reach

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:54.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
transfer level.

01:55:55.048 --> 01:55:55.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Is it course offerings and

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
scraps in class scheduling that

01:55:57.483 --> 01:55:59.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are unpredictable and sometimes

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:01.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
offer zero suggestions for

01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:01.621 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students to move for from any

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:02.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
type of sequence.

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:05.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Is that the cultural piece that

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:05.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
sometimes isn't translated

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:06.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
correctly when speaking to a

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:07.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
counselor who may not look like

01:56:07.493 --> 01:56:09.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
me. Or know about the future

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:11.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
plans in my expected thousand

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:11.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
I'll use.

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:13.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Is the lack of financial aid

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
resources to support attending a

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:16.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college that requires a one

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:19.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hundred fifty dollars textbook

01:56:19.138 --> 01:56:19.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that my professors wrote

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:20.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
themselves I'd know the option

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:21.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of buying it for my individual

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
tech a. Cold bookstore.

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:25.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is it the misrepresented sticker

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
price of college that attending

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:28.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
university doesn't accurately

01:56:29.048 --> 01:56:30.717 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
represent the cost of
attendance.

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:32.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Is it even more widespread of

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:34.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
conversation we had earlier that

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:35.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
students have such a minimal

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:36.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
resource that they're suffering

01:56:36.089 --> 01:56:37.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
from food and housing in

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:38.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
security. And such unstable

01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:39.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
livings condition that it's

01:56:39.392 --> 01:56:40.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
affecting their performance.

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:43.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The answer improving student

01:56:43.262 --> 01:56:44.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
equity and academic success

01:56:44.764 --> 01:56:46.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
around a cabs isn't just fixing

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:47.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a simple issue are placing

01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:49.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
reactive proposals. You know

01:56:49.235 --> 01:56:51.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
just our media education alone.

01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
From a report that's right for

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:53.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the legislative analyst's office

01:56:53.806 --> 01:56:55.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to some of our. Members here in

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:55.541 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
March.

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:58.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You're three quarters of first

01:56:58.978 --> 01:56:59.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
time Camino college students are

01:56:59.645 --> 01:57:01.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
determines unprepared.

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:02.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
More than forty percent of CSU

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:03.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students are determined as

01:57:03.549 --> 01:57:06.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
unprepared. And twenty percent

01:57:06.886 --> 01:57:07.387 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
of those first time you see

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:07.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students are also declared is

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:08.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
impaired.

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:10.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So from the onset we are you

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.992 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
know alone in Marin and

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:13.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
maneuvering through an almost

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:14.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
archaic website to fill a

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
confusing application questions.

01:57:17.029 --> 01:57:17.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We wait in lines for possible

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:19.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
times only to be told you have

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to come back in two three weeks

01:57:21.334 --> 01:57:21.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to meet with a counselor. The

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
has a one to seven hundred seat

01:57:23.269 --> 01:57:24.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
a ratio.

01:57:25.037 --> 01:57:25.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We hope that our financial aid

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:27.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
if awarded is dispersed early

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:29.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
enough to have our books by the

01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:29.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
second week of class.

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:31.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
All and managing to balance the

01:57:31.177 --> 01:57:33.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
successful work family and you

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:33.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
know some of us have a social

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
life.

01:57:36.849 --> 01:57:37.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So institutions will tell you

01:57:37.450 --> 01:57:38.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that they'll be the first to

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:39.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
tell you that they're doing

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:41.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
everything they can to improve

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the idea of academic success of

01:57:42.755 --> 01:57:49.061 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
students but even if the tools
are there

01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:49.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
we need to do a better job

01:57:49.662 --> 01:57:51.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
assistance at those tools.

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:51.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Really are there and where to

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:52.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
find them.

01:57:52.698 --> 01:57:55.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So there been out if I can offer

01:57:55.301 --> 01:57:56.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some suggestions on how we can

01:57:56.869 --> 01:57:57.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
move forward in specifics

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
incommunicado ge's you know I

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:01.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I've been involved the committee

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:03.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because system for a few years

01:58:03.075 --> 01:58:03.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
now and I've been of involved a

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:04.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
lot of conversations and. Most

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:06.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
recently has been a conversation

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:06.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that's kind of.

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:08.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:09.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You know was a little weird to

01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:10.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
me and it's it's a conversation

01:58:10.316 --> 01:58:11.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
on moving towards this idea of a

01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:13.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
fifteen unit Tory more of a full

01:58:13.319 --> 01:58:14.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
time.

01:58:14.821 --> 01:58:15.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Unit load for students right

01:58:15.455 --> 01:58:17.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
fifteen units per semester

01:58:17.323 --> 01:58:18.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
making it a thirty units a year

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:20.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
total and I know there's a.

01:58:20.893 --> 01:58:22.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Individuals argue that you know

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:25.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
fifteen units are doing its will

01:58:25.231 --> 01:58:25.698 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
get students there faster.

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:26.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:29.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But I would argue that students

01:58:29.268 --> 01:58:29.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of knowledge in the full time

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:31.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
status now will not will not be

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
incentivize by. At an extra

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
increase in financial aid to

01:58:34.841 --> 01:58:36.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
push them through right. Let's

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:38.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
say give a scenario of a single

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:39.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
mother I working.

01:58:39.412 --> 01:58:40.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
She's taking nine units right

01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:43.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
now barely making them and I'm

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:44.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
not even qualify for full time.

01:58:44.851 --> 01:58:47.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And additional grant of two or

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:47.753 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
three thousand dollars isn't

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:48.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
gonna keep her from child taking

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:50.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
care of those family values. And

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:51.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that's a look at the reality we

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:52.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
face for a lot of our students

01:58:52.225 --> 01:58:54.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
now. You know we talked about

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:56.562 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
earlier and and you know Devon

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:57.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
talking made a great point that

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:57.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
a lot of our students are

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:58.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
returning students and. Is a

01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:01.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
huge number of data surrounding

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the and I consider myself

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:05.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
retiring soon and I only took a

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:06.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
year and a half off. To students

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:07.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to come back five ten years

01:59:07.206 --> 01:59:09.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
later don't even have. This

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:11.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ability or even the generational

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:16.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
skills sometimes even knew over

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:17.383 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
there are systems.

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:18.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
If you move forward toward the

01:59:18.317 --> 01:59:18.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
system of you know providing

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:19.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
more resources to individuals of

01:59:19.585 --> 01:59:20.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
full time status of more than

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:20.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
twelve units are fifteen units.

01:59:20.853 --> 01:59:21.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I really urge you all to this to

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:23.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
talk the reality that might be

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:24.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
displacing some questions now.

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:25.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Beautifully thing that

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:26.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
displacing of students that are

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:27.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
even eligible for full time

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
status now in even further of

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:30.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
writing this a resources to

01:59:31.063 --> 01:59:32.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
competitors across our system.

01:59:33.032 --> 01:59:34.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Another suggestion I would hope.

01:59:35.034 --> 01:59:35.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Would be to write an additional

01:59:35.735 --> 01:59:37.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
focus on maybe I'd idea of

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:38.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
course scheduling class

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:40.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
offerings. In the realities I

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
faces a communicative students

01:59:43.009 --> 01:59:43.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
when I first enrolled.

01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:45.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I didn't know what classes are

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:46.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
going to be offered at you know

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a semester ahead of time and

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:50.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that's a really lot Communicorp

01:59:50.716 --> 01:59:52.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students face. And assist you

01:59:52.885 --> 01:59:53.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that and you see my pillow

01:59:53.419 --> 01:59:55.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
different we can map out a two

01:59:55.321 --> 01:59:55.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
year plan.

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:56.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But I've never understood how we

01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:57.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
expect students to maneuver

01:59:57.456 --> 01:59:59.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
system within two years when

01:59:59.225 --> 02:00:00.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
administrators and faculty

02:00:01.027 --> 02:00:02.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
leaders can never even planned

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:03.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
out of your head in the course

02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:04.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
scheduling.

02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:05.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You know when you have a chance

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:08.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
to.

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:09.402 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You know center over account

02:00:09.468 --> 02:00:10.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
isn't colleges do more what

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:13.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we're planning to count their

02:00:13.406 --> 02:00:13.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the class offerings. Nam

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:14.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
sometimes we look at class

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:16.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
offerings were it not really

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:17.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
focusing on begins I'm for

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:19.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
dividend graphic groups are work

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:21.147 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
groups in regards to evening and

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:23.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
weekend classes. And no surprise

02:00:23.249 --> 02:00:23.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
when I visit you see issues you

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:24.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
campus and I go there in the

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:27.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
evening and there such. You know

02:00:27.219 --> 02:00:28.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
is a popular student life and

02:00:29.055 --> 02:00:30.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it's driving in this its is so

02:00:31.023 --> 02:00:31.624 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
encouraging to see that people

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:32.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are wanting around the evenings

02:00:32.758 --> 02:00:34.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
when I visit local community

02:00:34.961 --> 02:00:35.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
colleges and there's no one

02:00:35.528 --> 02:00:36.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
passed by PM. You know offices

02:00:37.063 --> 02:00:39.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are closed sometimes we extend

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
hours the first or second week

02:00:41.167 --> 02:00:41.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of class but for the students

02:00:41.767 --> 02:00:43.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
who cannot get those

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:43.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
appointments within that that

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
first time period. Are left to

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:47.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
work on themselves and work from

02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:49.141 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
home and try to figure out you

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:54.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
know on minor maneuver whatever

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:55.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
system they have set a plate.

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:56.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And. If we want to continue our

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:57.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
conversations in regards through

02:00:57.116 --> 02:00:57.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
mediation yeah I'm hoping to

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:59.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have a meaningful conversation

02:00:59.151 --> 02:00:59.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
around that we also need to be

02:00:59.785 --> 02:01:01.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
open to the idea casa mixed

02:01:01.287 --> 02:01:02.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
expectations I not be on par

02:01:02.922 --> 02:01:04.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
with the reality of some

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:05.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students academic levels.

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:06.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So the conversations relying on

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
you know on placement test is

02:01:08.861 --> 02:01:09.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that students levels is also

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:10.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
changing right. Mortal measures

02:01:10.997 --> 02:01:12.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
have come to the forefront

02:01:12.698 --> 02:01:14.967 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
deciding we believe students

02:01:15.034 --> 02:01:15.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ready we most successful.

02:01:15.568 --> 02:01:17.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Things like high school GPA

02:01:17.103 --> 02:01:19.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
previous workload or even a

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:19.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
thirty minute counts or visit

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:20.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
can have just as enormous affect

02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:22.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
on whether I had to take two

02:01:22.908 --> 02:01:24.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
semesters of map before reaching

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:25.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a transfer level. Where they

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:27.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
have to take? Against you keep

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:29.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
me from being enrolled in

02:01:29.248 --> 02:01:29.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
another required class but

02:01:29.815 --> 02:01:32.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
whatever idea placement isn't

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:33.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
you know entirely after. An

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:35.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
assessment test can be seen as a

02:01:35.454 --> 02:01:36.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
way for two seconds scores for

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:39.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students expected. Achievement

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:41.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
levels because we use the tool

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:41.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to assist faculty in providing

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:44.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
an adaptive courts and adaptive

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:45.564 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
working environment for
students.

02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:46.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Faculty can finally learn some

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:49.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
for my data to students who test

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:50.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
intercourse and a bit dot the

02:01:51.037 --> 02:01:51.604 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
courses to more realistic level

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:52.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
person success.

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:54.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
This information copy made

02:01:54.874 --> 02:01:55.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
available using high school

02:01:55.441 --> 02:01:57.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
transit bit especially for those

02:01:57.243 --> 02:01:59.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
who don't self report.

02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:00.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
An assessment to my not be the

02:02:01.013 --> 02:02:01.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
answers to our questions

02:02:01.547 --> 02:02:02.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
surrounding placement and

02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:03.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
remediation but it can be argued

02:02:03.516 --> 02:02:05.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that we need more compatible

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:06.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
data to go about creating

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:07.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
adjusting reflect the courses

02:02:07.386 --> 02:02:09.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
instead of using outdated

02:02:09.221 --> 02:02:10.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
metrics that may negatively

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
impact some of our students.

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:13.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So we hope to continue like on

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
successes of passed bills like

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:17.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
assembly bill seven of five who

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:18.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
was also forming even greater

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:19.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
data sharing relationship with a

02:02:19.699 --> 02:02:21.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
key to talk partners. If

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:23.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
remediation such an issue you

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:24.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
know where there's a start is it

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:25.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
at the key to twelve level are

02:02:25.438 --> 02:02:26.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
we not preparing them from

02:02:27.039 --> 02:02:28.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
segment to segment. Center board

02:02:28.941 --> 02:02:30.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
data can only get so far and

02:02:30.776 --> 02:02:31.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
would sometimes no way of

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:33.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
verifying that information

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:33.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
without some validation

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
procedures. They'll be some and

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:36.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I pay place since along the way.

02:02:36.982 --> 02:02:37.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
And hope although these

02:02:37.483 --> 02:02:38.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
partnerships may only benefit

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:39.518 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
those populations coming

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
straight out of high school. A

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
huge portion of our students to

02:02:43.389 --> 02:02:46.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
come out at system we must

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:47.526 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
encourage their students as
well.

02:02:47.593 --> 02:02:49.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The conversations are on equity

02:02:49.195 --> 02:02:49.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
instance success on singular

02:02:49.795 --> 02:02:51.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
issues since success is directly

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:51.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
related issue discussed earlier

02:02:51.864 --> 02:02:53.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
like college affordability and

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:55.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
basic needs. There's no doubt

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:57.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that these issues of affect our

02:02:57.103 --> 02:02:57.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students differently some more

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:59.338 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
than others but if you plan to

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
move forward toward relevant

02:03:00.906 --> 02:03:02.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
vision for twenty first higher

02:03:02.842 --> 02:03:03.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
education system. In this

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:05.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
consent it continue to ensure

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:06.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
that these and.

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:07.580 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
This plan meets the needs of

02:03:07.646 --> 02:03:09.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
all of our students whether they

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:11.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
be working adults single mothers

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:13.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
straight outta high school. You

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:14.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
know different ethnic groups

02:03:15.054 --> 02:03:16.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
image keep that in mind if you

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:17.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
plan to move forward towards a

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:17.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
better future.

02:03:18.023 --> 02:03:26.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Okay.

near soon you can get lost in.

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:43.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
The today's stuff sorts

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:44.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
affirming a guest.

02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:47.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And so money was menu can to I'm

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:48.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I am academic journey starts a

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:50.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
small rule city club foreign.

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:51.390 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
My farm is city that is over

02:03:51.457 --> 02:03:54.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ninety percent spending.

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:55.528 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And in cemex most ruled smaller

02:03:55.594 --> 02:03:57.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
or cities and sell can Valley my

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:59.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
farm is home to many long come

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:00.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
in immigrant families.

02:04:00.766 --> 02:04:02.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And as a result of the low

02:04:02.635 --> 02:04:03.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
income area the school district

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:04.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of should not receive from the

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:06.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
same funding as other. Property

02:04:06.906 --> 02:04:08.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to the public taxes most.

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:11.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Some areas surrounding fund.

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:11.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
This means the fund had

02:04:11.577 --> 02:04:13.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
facilities and programs that

02:04:13.179 --> 02:04:14.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sometime some might consider sub

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:16.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
par.

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:17.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So it is very easy for someone

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:18.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to look at McFarland perceived

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:21.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
as a density.

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:21.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
And to be honest that's

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:22.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
something I did for so long.

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:25.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I looked up and fund and I

02:04:25.157 --> 02:04:27.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
thought. And what in

02:04:27.126 --> 02:04:27.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
appreciation time finally

02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
matured. And I start to

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:31.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
recognize my success in college

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:31.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
thus far.

02:04:31.597 --> 02:04:33.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Until I finally. It wouldn't

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:34.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
taste.

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:39.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Sorry Canaris.

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:40.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
That's.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:42.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
That's a good music.

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:43.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But longtime insurance start to

02:04:43.576 --> 02:04:45.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
recognize mixed success in

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:46.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
because that's part and started

02:04:46.812 --> 02:04:48.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
preaching the role models around

02:04:48.714 --> 02:04:49.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
me. I realize what Fong was a

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:51.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
great place.

02:04:51.150 --> 02:04:52.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I like despite depend inequity

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:53.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
McFarland to find myself reading

02:04:53.385 --> 02:04:55.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and encouraged to succeed higher

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:59.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I was prepared because I was

02:04:59.124 --> 02:04:59.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
better the gray pants and a

02:04:59.692 --> 02:05:01.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
great family. Acknowledge them

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:03.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
because they are the real reason

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:03.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
for my success.

02:05:03.829 --> 02:05:05.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My grandparents emigrated from

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:06.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Mexico but the bus had a program

02:05:06.832 --> 02:05:07.299 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that hopes of living the

02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:09.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
American dream. There of course

02:05:09.235 --> 02:05:11.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
face many hardships.

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:13.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And but they managed to instill

02:05:13.339 --> 02:05:14.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
the idea of grit and

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
determination to my parents.

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:17.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
As a result of their efforts

02:05:17.376 --> 02:05:19.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
both my parents would eventually

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:19.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
graduate from college and my

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:21.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
father also continue to receive

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:23.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
master's degree and become a

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:24.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
school administrator.

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:25.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So the stages are had already

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
been set for me to be more

02:05:27.052 --> 02:05:27.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
likely to succeed.

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:28.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I did not know that.

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I was always looking at my

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:32.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
environment and comparing it to

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:33.459 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
other places in thinking

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:34.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
McFarlane wasn't good enough.

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:35.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
My junior college in Bakersfield

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:36.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
wasn't good enough.

02:05:36.996 --> 02:05:40.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
And finally anti.

02:05:40.799 --> 02:05:41.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm not sure to make you into

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:43.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for the Pacific university they

02:05:43.168 --> 02:05:43.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
realize that those all those

02:05:43.769 --> 02:05:45.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
things were good enough.

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:49.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
I'd.

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:50.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I realized that my parents were

02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:51.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a product of small towns and

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:52.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
farmland I thought supportive

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:55.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
all the teachers that I. That I

02:05:55.247 --> 02:05:56.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
looked up to a part of the same

02:05:56.882 --> 02:05:57.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
type of smart spending

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:58.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
communities.

02:05:59.018 --> 02:06:00.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
All faculty members also part of

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:02.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
small communities.

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:03.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Also despite the low funding in

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:05.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
our schools many teachers up to

02:06:05.224 --> 02:06:06.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
put extra hours to.

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:09.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
For cadre news programs like

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:10.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
added writing workshops for

02:06:10.896 --> 02:06:12.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
public personal statements

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:13.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
mother look back and see the

02:06:13.632 --> 02:06:16.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
value in going up in McFarland.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:17.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Promoted to look like me

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:19.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
surround me and lead me to

02:06:19.138 --> 02:06:19.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
believe that anything could be

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:21.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
possible.

02:06:21.073 --> 02:06:23.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
My experience in higher

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:23.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
education has been quite

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:23.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
different.

02:06:23.976 --> 02:06:25.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Then high school of course the

02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:26.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
financial burden of college

02:06:27.046 --> 02:06:27.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
pushed into spend a few years at

02:06:27.713 --> 02:06:29.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
local communicative ge.

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:31.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Going up all the oldest and then

02:06:31.216 --> 02:06:32.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you realize. That your parents

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:34.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
at the finance for others

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:36.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students in college you can of

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:38.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the but bullet and a. Start off

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:39.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
at a community college.

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:44.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
But.

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:45.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Although the colleges different

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:47.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
took awhile for me to just my

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:48.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
parents were always by my side.

02:06:48.801 --> 02:06:49.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My parents wouldn't mind me to

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:51.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
visit my cancer every week

02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
because he to be proactive my

02:06:53.472 --> 02:06:54.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
transferring.

02:06:54.807 --> 02:06:56.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
My parents are my me don't

02:06:56.842 --> 02:06:57.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
believe to director time

02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:58.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
opposite between all those

02:06:59.044 --> 02:07:00.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
classes they remind me. That and

02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:01.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and the degree would be worth

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:02.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
all the effort. Out of venture

02:07:02.982 --> 02:07:04.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
transferred to prison Pacific

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:05.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
within two years of for the five

02:07:05.517 --> 02:07:06.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
units.

02:07:06.819 --> 02:07:07.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Since I didn't fully listen to

02:07:07.486 --> 02:07:08.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
my parents about being proactive

02:07:08.954 --> 02:07:11.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
my courses it would come back to

02:07:11.156 --> 02:07:12.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
haunt me. Got a bunch of. Five

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
years instead of four.

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:15.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But I have no regrets I'm happy

02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:17.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
with my progress. The be the

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:17.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
good thing about the minor

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:18.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
mistake.

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:21.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Is that my brother would

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
eventually transferred to you

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
for the Pacific university.

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:25.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And then try to state and be on

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:26.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the right track to graduate.

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
Immediately.

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:31.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So I was happy I was here from

02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:32.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the percent Pacific university I

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:34.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
saw that. He was the home*

02:07:34.713 --> 02:07:36.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
side continued Pullman knows

02:07:36.715 --> 02:07:37.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
down hit the books and get the

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:37.616 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
grades I need.

02:07:37.683 --> 02:07:39.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And so if I can relate my story

02:07:39.184 --> 02:07:39.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
to the broader student

02:07:39.651 --> 02:07:41.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
population. I would encourage

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:43.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students to try and find hope in

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:43.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
their minor minor but no matter

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:44.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
what it is.

02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Look for all models that we're

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:47.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
power you to do your best I

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:48.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
wished I was a cookie cutter

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:50.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
solution I could offer you a

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:51.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
punch in the dry direction of

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:52.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
several model.

02:07:52.898 --> 02:07:55.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The process you deserve process

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:55.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
you have to discover for

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:55.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
yourself

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:56.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a to my parents another teacher

02:07:57.036 --> 02:07:59.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for granted not until use them.

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:01.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
For. As a research again the

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
fearsome become more active in

02:08:03.142 --> 02:08:05.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Texas that success so. I think

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:07.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
this is also true that

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:07.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
universities can provide and

02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:08.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
help.

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Fix equity in our communities.

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:13.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I visit the city university all

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:15.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the plan about many things that

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:15.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
can help improve equity instant

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:16.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
success.

02:08:17.022 --> 02:08:18.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I would come is because of what

02:08:18.924 --> 02:08:20.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
I call repair mentor.

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:21.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is my favorite job on campus and

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:23.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I think it's a great step in the

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:23.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
right direction to improve

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:24.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
equity.

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
As a multicultural peer mentor I

02:08:27.032 --> 02:08:28.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
am one of the six to stressors

02:08:29.001 --> 02:08:30.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as a role model friend. Or

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:33.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
mentor to help people their

02:08:33.105 --> 02:08:33.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
first generation college

02:08:33.639 --> 02:08:35.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students navigate through higher

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:36.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:37.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
But opponents fund by the US

02:08:37.476 --> 02:08:39.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
program to advance Medina

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:41.180 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
academic success and the good

02:08:41.246 --> 02:08:41.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
thing about is that we for

02:08:41.814 --> 02:08:43.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
surfers generation college

02:08:43.148 --> 02:08:44.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students so any first generation

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:47.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
students. Contention to be a

02:08:47.453 --> 02:08:47.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
part of our program.

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
First generations and third

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:50.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
generation cautions cannot be

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Lassen universe things

02:08:53.025 --> 02:08:53.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
university since I don't have

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:55.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that family member who basic

02:08:55.227 --> 02:08:56.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
shell before them and higher

02:08:56.929 --> 02:08:58.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
education. There ought to not

02:08:58.897 --> 02:09:00.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
real friend is the right

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:01.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
decision for them.

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Parents often don't do not their

02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:03.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
parents not often understand the

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:06.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
challenges. That their children

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:07.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
may face insular Zemin tango but

02:09:07.506 --> 02:09:09.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grow between parent and child.

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:11.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
First generation soon sometimes

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:12.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
do not know how to manage our

02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:13.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
time outside of a high school

02:09:13.312 --> 02:09:16.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
setting.

02:09:16.882 --> 02:09:17.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
These two three all prioritize

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
work over staying to help out

02:09:18.717 --> 02:09:20.719 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
their family's financial
burdens.

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:21.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Students under duck out also

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:24.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sometimes fear for applying to

02:09:24.857 --> 02:09:25.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
government programs in general.

02:09:25.491 --> 02:09:26.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
It can be very scary for

02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:28.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students be experiencing these

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:29.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
troubles and realize that their

02:09:29.495 --> 02:09:31.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
parents cannot help them despite

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:32.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
all their efforts.

02:09:32.998 --> 02:09:33.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
This can be very discouraging

02:09:33.599 --> 02:09:35.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
for students so is our job to

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
bridge the gap. For these tunes

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:38.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and be that role model to help

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:39.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
them stay on most.

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:40.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Stay on the path and most.

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:42.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
At image.

02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:44.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
To help them.

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:47.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To give them more wild role

02:09:47.379 --> 02:09:48.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
models that are wiser.

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:52.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And that look like them.

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:54.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We will be the first ones who

02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you keep all those tunes as best

02:09:55.554 --> 02:09:55.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
we can.

02:09:55.787 --> 02:09:57.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So University should provide

02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students with dub twenty to ten

02:09:57.856 --> 02:09:59.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
different social awareness

02:09:59.191 --> 02:09:59.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
program to be part of different

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:00.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
scholarship programs and

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:02.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
interact with people on a

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:03.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
different social spheres.

02:10:03.395 --> 02:10:05.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
University to be able to

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
encourage leaders to be aware

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:07.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
and Chile represent their

02:10:07.466 --> 02:10:08.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
student body.

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:09.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I believe students benefit the

02:10:09.501 --> 02:10:11.036 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
most when their mentors
<u>&lt;c.green&gt; can&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:10:11.103 --> 02:10:13.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
relate to that doesn't mean I

02:10:13.071 --> 02:10:14.907 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
have to be some of the same
race.

02:10:14.973 --> 02:10:16.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But the leadership be competent

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:17.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and consider enough to hear

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:18.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
their situations.

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:20.812 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:23.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Students should know that their

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:25.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
pine self and they should not be

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:26.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
unjustly help of success hard

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:27.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
work should be only Kate only

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:29.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
thing the gauges success.

02:10:29.087 --> 02:10:30.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Last if you come from.

02:10:30.889 --> 02:10:33.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
If you come from home place you

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:34.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that your band showcase your

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:35.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ability to overcome adversity

02:10:35.661 --> 02:10:36.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
and rice a challenge.

02:10:36.895 --> 02:10:39.464 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That is a vital skill set that

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
you get the police have if

02:10:40.933 --> 02:10:42.701 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you're a person that comes from

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:44.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
an equity and succeeds did your.

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:45.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Did your but do your best to

02:10:45.404 --> 02:10:46.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
become a role model to other

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:48.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
people. I do inspiration for

02:10:48.974 --> 02:10:49.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
many people who I didn't even

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:49.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
know.

02:10:49.775 --> 02:10:51.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Every colleges acceptance letter

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:52.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
that I heard about.

02:10:52.844 --> 02:10:54.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
From an upperclassman was a

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:56.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
great inspiration to me every

02:10:56.915 --> 02:10:57.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
time I heard that someone

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:59.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
transferred to university in two

02:10:59.351 --> 02:10:59.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:00.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
inspiration to me.

02:11:00.752 --> 02:11:01.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Every time I heard about some

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:03.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
can you tell that right after

02:11:03.422 --> 02:11:05.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college thousand inspiration to

02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:07.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
me and they may never have even

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:07.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
known.

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:10.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So you can sure you can't by

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:14.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
people. By own personal success

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:15.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

you're doing.

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:52.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I am I just wanted a state for

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:54.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the record I also was not around

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:56.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
in the nineteen sixties.

02:11:56.908 --> 02:11:58.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Although my daughter does say

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:00.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that I'm ancient and on my last

02:12:00.779 --> 02:12:02.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
birthday ask me how that felt.

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:05.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My name's Michelle cicadas I'm

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
president of the campaign for

02:12:06.852 --> 02:12:09.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college opportunity. And I used

02:12:09.121 --> 02:12:11.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
to always say that.

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:13.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I was super lucky that I got to

02:12:13.425 --> 02:12:14.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
college.

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You see my mother I immigrated

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:18.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
here from Mexico with only a

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
sixth grade education.

02:12:21.033 --> 02:12:21.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I she had no idea how to help me

02:12:21.733 --> 02:12:24.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
fill out that faster which all

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:25.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
of you should know is due

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:26.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
tomorrow if you want to be

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:28.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
eligible for cal grant aid tell

02:12:28.974 --> 02:12:30.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
everyone you know.

02:12:31.043 --> 02:12:32.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Tell every undocumented student

02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:33.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that they can still access the

02:12:33.345 --> 02:12:34.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
dream act.

02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:37.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So I used to say that I was

02:12:37.149 --> 02:12:39.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
lucky that I was able to fill

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
out that Pfaff said that I was.

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:43.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Encouraged to apply to college

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:45.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that I ended up going to Pitzer

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and then to UCLA on affirmative

02:12:47.292 --> 02:12:48.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
action scholarship.

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And then I got out of college

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:52.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
with about sixteen thousand

02:12:52.931 --> 02:12:54.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
dollars and dad.

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:57.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I out which was pretty fantastic

02:12:57.069 --> 02:12:57.602 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
at that time given the world

02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:59.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
class education I gotta both

02:12:59.471 --> 02:12:59.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
institute

02:12:59.738 --> 02:13:00.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
tions.

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:03.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But now I tell everybody that

02:13:03.175 --> 02:13:04.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
it's absolutely not at all

02:13:04.976 --> 02:13:06.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
related to lock.

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
In fact it's related to

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:09.214 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
everything that you can make

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:10.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
happen and that you do S.

02:13:11.016 --> 02:13:12.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
policymakers.

02:13:13.018 --> 02:13:14.820 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Because it was policymakers that

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:16.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
insured there was financial aid

02:13:17.055 --> 02:13:17.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
so I could go to college.

02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:19.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
That there were student loans so

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:20.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that I could afford to get there

02:13:20.926 --> 02:13:22.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
and get through.

02:13:22.928 --> 02:13:23.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I and it was those affirmative

02:13:23.562 --> 02:13:24.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
action.

02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:27.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Supports that allowed me to go

02:13:27.232 --> 02:13:28.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to graduate school and be the

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
first in my family to or not

02:13:30.769 --> 02:13:31.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
only a bachelor's degree but a

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:34.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
master's degree.

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The campaign for college up to

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:38.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ninety was founded by folks that

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:39.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
were around in the nineteen

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:40.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
sixties.

02:13:40.746 --> 02:13:43.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
In fact David wolf and Steve

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:44.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Winer were baby boomers that got

02:13:44.816 --> 02:13:45.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to benefit from the master plan

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:46.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
promise.

02:13:47.052 --> 02:13:50.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Got to go to you see for free.

02:13:50.756 --> 02:13:53.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are if you can imagine. And were

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:54.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
dismayed in the early two

02:13:54.893 --> 02:13:56.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thousands that our state leaders

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:57.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
were not funding higher

02:13:57.362 --> 02:13:59.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education sufficiently to make

02:13:59.297 --> 02:14:00.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sure that students could have.

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:01.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That promise that we've all

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:02.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
talked about.

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:05.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So they founded the campaign for

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:06.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
college opportunity.

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:09.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And our focus and mission has

02:14:09.541 --> 02:14:11.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
not changed since two thousand

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:13.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and four and that's that more

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:13.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Californian should have the

02:14:13.712 --> 02:14:15.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
opportunity to go to college.

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:17.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That once they get there they

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
should actually complete college

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:21.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and that we should be unabashed

02:14:21.253 --> 02:14:23.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
unapologetic about closing the

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:24.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
racial and ethnic gaps that

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:25.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
persist in California higher

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:29.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

02:14:29.127 --> 02:14:31.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm much has changed since we

02:14:31.296 --> 02:14:32.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
started at the campaign for

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:33.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
college opportunity fourteen

02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:34.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
years ago.

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:37.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We've done a lot more to grow

02:14:37.335 --> 02:14:40.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
access in California but not

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:41.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
enough to close the projected

02:14:41.373 --> 02:14:43.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
one point seven million.

02:14:43.175 --> 02:14:45.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Shortfall of graduates that we

02:14:45.177 --> 02:14:46.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
are going to need.

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In some ways the good news is

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
more and more Californians are

02:14:49.514 --> 02:14:51.349 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ready to go to college want to

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:52.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
go to college. Have completed

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:55.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the a through G. requirements so

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:56.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that they can get to college.

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:59.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And yet we continue to turn

02:14:59.124 --> 02:15:02.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
away eligible students at the UC

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:05.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and the CSU. Every single day

02:15:05.163 --> 02:15:07.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
including today because we don't

02:15:07.232 --> 02:15:10.836 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
funds are universities enough
to.

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:12.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Take them all.

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:14.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In nineteen ninety five about

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thirty five percent of high

02:15:16.942 --> 02:15:17.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
school graduates completed a

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:19.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
through G. those are the courses

02:15:19.110 --> 02:15:21.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
that you need.

02:15:21.079 --> 02:15:21.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
To get to college.

02:15:21.513 --> 02:15:24.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Today aye that number has

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:26.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
increased significantly to a

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:28.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
record forty four percent.

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:30.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But there's huge inequality when

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:31.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you breakdown that figure by

02:15:31.556 --> 02:15:32.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
race

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:35.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in fact white students completed

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:37.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a through G. by forty almost

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:39.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
fifty percent but Latino

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:41.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students only thirty five

02:15:41.199 --> 02:15:43.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
percent of high school seniors

02:15:43.235 --> 02:15:45.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
who graduate that are like the

02:15:45.136 --> 02:15:45.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you know can even apply to you

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Sierra CSU. And only thirty

02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:49.140 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
three percent of black students

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:52.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
can apply to use your CSU.

02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:55.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
That's unacceptable.

02:15:55.146 --> 02:15:56.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The other thing that's honored

02:15:56.815 --> 02:15:57.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that unacceptable or the

02:15:57.349 --> 02:15:59.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
enrollment cap set by the master

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:00.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
plan.

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:02.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We've said that only the top

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:05.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
third of Californians should go

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:06.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
to you Sierra CSU campus.

02:16:06.958 --> 02:16:09.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That worked for the nineteen

02:16:09.127 --> 02:16:11.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sixties but not for today when

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:13.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
more and more jobs require that

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:15.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students actually have a college

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:17.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

02:16:17.068 --> 02:16:19.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So. My ask to you as that you

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:23.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
left the enrollment caps at the

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:25.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UC in the CSU. It should not be

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:27.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
harder for our kids to get into

02:16:27.078 --> 02:16:28.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
college than it was for us.

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Especially since this economy

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:33.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
practically requires a college

02:16:33.184 --> 02:16:34.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
education.

02:16:34.886 --> 02:16:37.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The limits of the master plan

02:16:37.155 --> 02:16:38.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
enrollment caps and inadequate

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:41.192 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
funding for CSU and you see

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:42.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
forced many students to attend

02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:44.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
community college first with the

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:46.965 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
hopes of transferring. To

02:16:47.032 --> 02:16:47.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
complete a bachelor's degree.

02:16:47.666 --> 02:16:49.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Unfortunately the route from

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:51.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
community colleges to four year

02:16:51.303 --> 02:16:53.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
universities is much more of a

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:55.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Mayes than a straight forward

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:56.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
passed away as you already heard

02:16:56.875 --> 02:16:59.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
from our to student leaders
here.

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Although a majority of community

02:17:00.779 --> 02:17:03.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
college students in roll. Out

02:17:03.181 --> 02:17:05.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
with the goal of transferring

02:17:05.083 --> 02:17:07.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
only four percent.

02:17:07.118 --> 02:17:09.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Only four percent do so within

02:17:09.321 --> 02:17:10.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
two years.

02:17:11.022 --> 02:17:12.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And only thirty eight percent

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:16.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
after six years.

02:17:17.028 --> 02:17:18.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Transfer students will take six

02:17:18.763 --> 02:17:21.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
point four years to earn a

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:23.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
bachelor's degree at the UC. And

02:17:23.134 --> 02:17:26.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
seven years at the CSU.

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That results in an additional

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:30.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
thirty six to thirty thousand

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:32.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
dollars in expenses for transfer

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:33.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
students compared to freshmen

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:34.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
admits.

02:17:34.746 --> 02:17:37.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The transfer process is broken

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:39.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in California due to the lack of

02:17:39.284 --> 02:17:39.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
coordination between the

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
segments.

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:43.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
California's also unique in its

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:45.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
lack of a statewide official or

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
entity that insurers are various

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
segments have to work together.

02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:50.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
More seamlessly.

02:17:50.795 --> 02:17:53.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Such an entity must have the

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:55.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
responsibility authority

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:56.835 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
capacity staff and financial.

02:17:56.901 --> 02:17:59.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A resources to be effective in

02:17:59.237 --> 02:18:00.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
advancing a state agenda.

02:18:00.905 --> 02:18:05.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
For California not an agenda for

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:07.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the UC. Not an agenda for the

02:18:07.278 --> 02:18:09.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
CSU not an agenda for community

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:11.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
colleges.

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:12.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
An agenda for California and its

02:18:12.917 --> 02:18:16.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:19.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
That agenda should be to

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
increase college access

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:23.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
attainment rates to improve

02:18:23.194 --> 02:18:25.296 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
transfer and close the equity

02:18:25.363 --> 02:18:25.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
gaps.

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:27.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We need an entity that keeps the

02:18:27.565 --> 02:18:29.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
interest of students on the

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:31.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
state at the center of any

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:31.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
conversation between the

02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:32.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
segments.

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:35.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The C. S. you in the UC offer

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
their own version of admission

02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:39.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
guarantees and two different

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sets of lower division general

02:18:40.945 --> 02:18:41.513 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ed requirements first transfer

02:18:41.579 --> 02:18:42.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

02:18:42.847 --> 02:18:44.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
In twenty ten as you know the

02:18:45.050 --> 02:18:46.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
campaign for college opportunity

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:47.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
sponsored legislation to

02:18:47.552 --> 02:18:49.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
establish the associate degrees

02:18:49.387 --> 02:18:50.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
for transfer. Which offer

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:54.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
seamless one hundred twenty unit

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:55.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
passed a bachelors degree.

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:57.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Students earning this associate

02:18:57.295 --> 02:18:59.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
degree for transfer guaranteed

02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:00.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
admission to the C. S. you with

02:19:00.932 --> 02:19:02.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
junior standing. And a bachelors

02:19:02.934 --> 02:19:04.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
degree with for ways to

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:05.537 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
guarantee that they won't have

02:19:05.603 --> 02:19:07.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to complete more than sixty

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:08.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
units.

02:19:08.773 --> 02:19:09.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
There are now eighty tease in

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:11.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
thirty two majors with college

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:12.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
is still developing these

02:19:12.744 --> 02:19:13.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
programs and we're starting to

02:19:13.344 --> 02:19:15.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
see the impact.

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:15.547 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I just want to share one

02:19:15.613 --> 02:19:18.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
statistic students that transfer

02:19:18.817 --> 02:19:20.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to a CSU with an associate

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:21.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
degree. Actually earned that

02:19:21.653 --> 02:19:23.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
bachelor's degree forty eight

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:24.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent faster that students

02:19:24.989 --> 02:19:25.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that transfer the traditional

02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:26.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
way.

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:29.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
They earn it out of twenty seven

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:30.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
percent rate.

02:19:31.029 --> 02:19:33.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
There are a lot of efforts to

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:35.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
expand the ADT program and we

02:19:35.266 --> 02:19:37.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
support them including those

02:19:37.102 --> 02:19:38.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
efforts to align with the

02:19:39.003 --> 02:19:40.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
western governors us university.

02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:42.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And also with historically black

02:19:42.907 --> 02:19:43.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
colleges and universities

02:19:43.441 --> 02:19:44.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
across the state.

02:19:44.843 --> 02:19:47.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But we need to make sure that we

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:47.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
continue to maintain that

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:50.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
promise and expanded everywhere.

02:19:50.849 --> 02:19:53.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Are there other means through

02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:55.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
which we fail to design colleges

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:57.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for student success it's often

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:58.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
lamented that many students are

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
not college ready when stepping

02:20:00.959 --> 02:20:02.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
onto campus.

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:04.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But we must also be Frank and

02:20:04.729 --> 02:20:07.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
asking if colleges consistently

02:20:07.232 --> 02:20:07.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
prove themselves to be student

02:20:07.866 --> 02:20:11.002 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ready.

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:12.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Alejandro already talked about

02:20:12.837 --> 02:20:14.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
remedial education so I'm not

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
going to go into that. But we

02:20:16.908 --> 02:20:19.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
also sponsored assembly bill

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
seven oh five to ensure that

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:23.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
colleges could use more than

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:24.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
just the assessment test.

02:20:24.983 --> 02:20:27.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
To place students by one of your

02:20:27.218 --> 02:20:30.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
colleagues Jacqui Irwin.

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:33.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I'm. Guided pathways is also

02:20:33.491 --> 02:20:35.193 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
another means to shape college

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:37.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
practices to make sure that more

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:39.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students get to their goals and

02:20:39.230 --> 02:20:40.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
reach their dreams.

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:43.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
As previously mentioned most

02:20:43.134 --> 02:20:45.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
students come man with the goal

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.971 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of transferring and yet there

02:20:47.038 --> 02:20:50.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Matt with a lot of confusion.

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Last year we actively supported

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:53.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the state budget investment of a

02:20:53.711 --> 02:20:55.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hundred and fifty million budget

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:57.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
allocation to expand guided

02:20:57.148 --> 02:20:59.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
pathways in community colleges.

02:20:59.217 --> 02:21:02.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

02:21:03.054 --> 02:21:03.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
You know it's called guided

02:21:03.655 --> 02:21:05.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
pathways but it simply common

02:21:05.490 --> 02:21:06.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
sense.

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:08.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Students should arrive in

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:09.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college and not have to gas how

02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:11.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they might pull off transfer or

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:14.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
get a certificate or degree.

02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:18.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
On March fifth a. We are going

02:21:18.937 --> 02:21:19.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:20.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

02:21:21.005 --> 02:21:22.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
colleges and universities.

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:25.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Hurts our values our students

02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:26.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%

02:21:26.978 --> 02:21:27.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

While that next students now

02:21:37.722 --> 02:21:39.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

universities are Latin at.

02:21:51.302 --> 02:21:54.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Only five percent are black.

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:55.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Leadership roles are still

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
highly exclusive with whites

02:21:57.308 --> 02:21:58.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
comprising sixty percent of

02:21:58.743 --> 02:21:59.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
senior leadership roles in

02:22:00.812 --> 02:22:03.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
More than sixty percent of our

02:22:03.248 --> 02:22:05.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And over eighty percent of the

systemwide academic senates

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:14.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
across our community colleges

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:16.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and universities are white.

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
As leaders who care about

02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:20.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
improving student outcomes and

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
closing racial gaps in it

02:22:22.934 --> 02:22:23.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
inequality in our own state.

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:25.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Let we share that there is no

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:26.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
way to do that without ensuring

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:28.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
greater inclusivity in our

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:31.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
campuses.

02:22:31.075 --> 02:22:31.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
You heard from both our students

02:22:31.776 --> 02:22:33.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Manuel and I'll handle about the

02:22:33.311 --> 02:22:35.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
importance of seeing themselves

02:22:35.113 --> 02:22:37.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in the leaders in front of them.

02:22:37.081 --> 02:22:38.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
All students

white black Latin next Asian

02:22:41.052 --> 02:22:43.254 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
American. Benefit from being

02:22:43.321 --> 02:22:45.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
exposed to the diversity that

02:22:45.323 --> 02:22:46.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
has made California strong.

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:48.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
As policymakers I urge you to

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:50.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
require community colleges and

02:22:51.029 --> 02:22:52.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
universities to collect and

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:54.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
report data by race of their

02:22:54.899 --> 02:22:57.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
leaders and academic Senate's.

02:22:57.835 --> 02:22:59.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
They're only required to do it

02:22:59.270 --> 02:23:03.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
for faculty and students that's.

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:13.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Not not.

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:13.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We're all urged governor and the

02:23:13.785 --> 02:23:14.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Senate. Many.

02:23:14.819 --> 02:23:16.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
To. See region.

02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:17.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
See.

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:21.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Please. Anchor college governor.

02:23:21.192 --> 02:23:21.759 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Refer the population diversity

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:22.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
of California.

02:23:22.193 --> 02:23:22.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

02:23:22.393 --> 02:23:23.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Of the number of women in our

02:23:23.161 --> 02:23:23.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
state.

02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:23.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I just want to share a few stats

02:23:24.062 --> 02:23:24.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
that you'll get to see on

02:23:24.595 --> 02:23:24.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Tuesday.

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:26.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
The UC regents has twenty six

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:30.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
members only seven women.

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:32.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Sixty two percent are white.

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:35.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The CSU board of trustees.

02:23:35.139 --> 02:23:36.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Thirty five percent women.

02:23:36.841 --> 02:23:38.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Seventy percent white.

02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:41.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The community college board of

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:42.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
governors.

02:23:43.047 --> 02:23:44.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Forty one percent women.

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:50.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Seventy seven percent white.

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:53.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We are the sixth largest economy

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:55.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in the world we're not gonna

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
maintain that standing or that

02:23:57.195 --> 02:24:00.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
force. If we leave people out if

02:24:00.832 --> 02:24:01.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we don't close the racial gaps

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:05.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
that persist and if we don't.

02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:06.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Just talk about how progressive

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:08.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we are as a Californians but act

02:24:08.873 --> 02:24:10.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
on it.

02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:12.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The California dream is premised

02:24:12.944 --> 02:24:13.544 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
on the idea that any of us can

02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:15.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
imagine and create a brighter

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:16.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
future.

02:24:16.781 --> 02:24:18.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Well only honor the dream by

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:19.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ensuring our children can

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:21.219 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
partake in the same

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:21.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
opportunities.

02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:23.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That past generations were able

02:24:23.421 --> 02:24:26.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
to.

02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:29.093 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
You started this hearing by

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
talking about the promise.

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:33.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Promise as a noun means a

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
commitment to do something.

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I urge you to use it as a verb.

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:38.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Which means you will do

02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:38.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
something.

02:24:38.736 --> 02:24:46.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:47.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

Thank you.

02:24:56.954 --> 02:24:57.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Okay ó whole life trying to

02:24:57.522 --> 02:25:00.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
find this worse for them.

Valley.

02:25:57.915 --> 02:25:59.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The Central Valley who are weeks

02:25:59.183 --> 02:26:01.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
of the Central Valley is a is a

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
group of of colleges and

02:26:02.854 --> 02:26:04.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
universities all from Stockton

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:06.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
all the way down to of Kern

02:26:07.024 --> 02:26:08.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
county from some walking calmly.

For community college district

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:14.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
offices.

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:16.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The three California state

02:26:17.001 --> 02:26:17.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
universities in the in the

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
region. It includes the

02:26:19.203 --> 02:26:19.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
university of California the

02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:21.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
tenth floor campus of the camp

02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:23.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of the of the system and that

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:24.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
concludes five of our

02:26:24.942 --> 02:26:26.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
independent colleges and

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:27.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
universities.

02:26:27.311 --> 02:26:28.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
In the valley.

02:26:28.779 --> 02:26:31.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So we come together to single

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:33.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
voice and it's a unique

02:26:33.217 --> 02:26:34.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
organization in that in that our

02:26:35.052 --> 02:26:36.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
board of directors of the

02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:37.321 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
president's and the and the

02:26:37.388 --> 02:26:39.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
chances. Of the institutions so

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:40.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
that we get when we come

02:26:40.758 --> 02:26:40.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
together.

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:42.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We come together we strive

02:26:42.994 --> 02:26:45.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
speak with one voice up what you

02:26:45.196 --> 02:26:46.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
look at what we have listed here

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:47.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
when I have listed here. Are a

02:26:47.732 --> 02:26:49.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
number of partners that were for

02:26:49.267 --> 02:26:50.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we've been partnering with here

02:26:50.968 --> 02:26:52.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
in the Central Valley to bring

02:26:52.937 --> 02:26:55.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
student success and equity

02:26:55.173 --> 02:26:56.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
because we think. That you have

02:26:56.941 --> 02:26:59.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to be equally given the equal

02:26:59.076 --> 02:27:00.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and inclusive then it's got to

02:27:01.012 --> 02:27:01.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
be student success across the

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
board right it can't just be

02:27:03.414 --> 02:27:05.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
some other so the sunlight up.

02:27:05.183 --> 02:27:08.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Because I'm mindful of the time

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:09.220 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
also so but.

02:27:09.287 --> 02:27:10.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Back in twenty sixteen.

02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:11.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Our board of directors for the

02:27:11.556 --> 02:27:13.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
directors had a had a some in

02:27:13.257 --> 02:27:15.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
fact up in fact assemblyman.

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:17.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Arambula was there any like all

02:27:17.562 --> 02:27:21.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
fired up because we were showing

02:27:21.132 --> 02:27:22.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
data we were showing data that

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
was very very specific. About

02:27:25.036 --> 02:27:26.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
what we needed to do as as

02:27:26.837 --> 02:27:29.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
colleges and universities and

02:27:29.073 --> 02:27:29.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Central Valley to lift all of

02:27:29.707 --> 02:27:30.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
our youngsters.

02:27:30.841 --> 02:27:33.211 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Again equity to bring them all

02:27:33.277 --> 02:27:35.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
up and so there are there are a

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:37.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
number of things set that came

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
out of that summit that I wanted

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to talk about so the first

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
strategy. The first strategy

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:43.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
that we're doing across the

02:27:43.287 --> 02:27:45.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
board we're trying to scale this

02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:46.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
thing up across the board is a

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:49.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
co requisite remediation. End up

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:50.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
with color called correct with a

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:52.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
real patient different folks

02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:54.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
college different things but

02:27:54.899 --> 02:27:55.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
tell you what it is in the

02:27:55.433 --> 02:27:55.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
second.

02:27:55.666 --> 02:27:56.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
That's correct with the

02:27:56.167 --> 02:27:57.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
remediation and mathematics and

02:27:57.168 --> 02:27:58.803 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
English.

02:27:58.869 --> 02:28:00.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
What we know?

02:28:00.972 --> 02:28:01.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
What we know is that when young

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:02.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
people?

02:28:02.974 --> 02:28:05.009 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Get stuck at the gateway at the

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:06.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
community colleges we have this

02:28:07.044 --> 02:28:08.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this huge group of students.

02:28:08.779 --> 02:28:11.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Who get to the gateway to

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:12.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
transfer and never do?

02:28:12.984 --> 02:28:15.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Ninety two percent of them never

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:16.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
transfer because they can't get

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:18.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
past college algebra the

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:20.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
couldn't get past that great and

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:22.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in time is a problem. Because if

02:28:23.027 --> 02:28:23.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
you're in the community because

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of just state of another here

02:28:25.263 --> 02:28:25.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
another year and a half two

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:28.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
years. Them start losing folks

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:29.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
there's a study from the public

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:30.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
policy institute of California.

02:28:31.035 --> 02:28:33.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That tells us that in it when

02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:35.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
they studied the Inland Empire

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:37.208 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Los Angeles and the Central

02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:39.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Valley. That in a five year

02:28:39.076 --> 02:28:40.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
period.

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:41.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Now get this.

02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So for this support for the for

02:28:43.414 --> 02:28:45.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the legislators on my couch we

02:28:45.082 --> 02:28:46.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
spent all that money and we

02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:47.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
really didn't get anywhere.

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:50.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Three hundred thousand students.

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Got to the gateway.

02:28:52.757 --> 02:28:53.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And that were crossed into

02:28:53.291 --> 02:28:54.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
transfer.

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:57.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That was an a five year period

02:28:57.128 --> 02:28:58.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
for just those threes those

02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
three years of of California she

02:28:59.697 --> 02:29:02.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
can imagine. What's going on in

02:29:02.867 --> 02:29:04.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the rest of the state so that

02:29:04.935 --> 02:29:05.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
it's an equity right medicine

02:29:05.569 --> 02:29:07.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
benefit right that isn't okay

02:29:07.438 --> 02:29:09.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
four four X. number students to

02:29:09.340 --> 02:29:11.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
get there and not be able to get

02:29:11.242 --> 02:29:13.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
into the. Promised land do not

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:15.146 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
be able to get to get the to

02:29:15.212 --> 02:29:16.714 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
cross that to cross over.

02:29:16.781 --> 02:29:19.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So our colleges and universities

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:20.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are implementing cho requisite

02:29:20.851 --> 02:29:21.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
remediation on hunter spoke to

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:22.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
the bed. And and.

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:25.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And and about this notion about

02:29:25.189 --> 02:29:27.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Hey how do we place students of.

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:28.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The assembly passed AB seven

02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:31.162 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
forty spend referenced a number

02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:34.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of times today. Awe and then and

02:29:34.865 --> 02:29:36.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
then chancer Tim why.

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:38.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Did this really gutsy thing and

02:29:39.036 --> 02:29:40.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
he signed an executive order.

02:29:40.805 --> 02:29:42.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Requiring multiple measures also

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:43.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
at the California State

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:44.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
University

02:29:44.875 --> 02:29:47.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
system so now in the California

02:29:47.211 --> 02:29:48.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
State University system. And in

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:50.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the community colleges there is

02:29:51.048 --> 02:29:53.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
a quick requirement for placing

02:29:53.117 --> 02:29:53.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students and these gateway

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:54.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
courses.

02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:56.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Using multiple measures

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:58.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
but but as a result of that ins

02:29:58.989 --> 02:30:00.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and that CSU they're also be

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
required to implement co

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
requisite we.

02:30:04.929 --> 02:30:05.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And the community colleges are

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:07.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
moving along here in the valley

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:08.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
we have a movement where these

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:09.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
colleges are taking call

02:30:09.433 --> 02:30:11.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
represent remediation at scaling

02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:13.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that up. And what that means is

02:30:13.237 --> 02:30:15.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that just very simply for those

02:30:15.206 --> 02:30:18.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of you don't understand it so

02:30:18.876 --> 02:30:19.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
let's take English one a.

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So those of you who were a lot

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:21.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
smarter than me would've taken

02:30:21.779 --> 02:30:23.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
English one. And taken a three

02:30:23.114 --> 02:30:25.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
uniclass bang that out and gone

02:30:25.116 --> 02:30:26.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
through.

02:30:27.051 --> 02:30:28.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For those people that were not

02:30:28.886 --> 02:30:31.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
as well prepared you would take

02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:32.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
it and probably didn't passed.

02:30:32.857 --> 02:30:34.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Or you or worse yet no worship

02:30:34.925 --> 02:30:37.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
worship you would get in there

02:30:37.194 --> 02:30:37.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
you take a placement exam and

02:30:37.828 --> 02:30:38.763 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
they would tell you because it's

02:30:38.829 --> 02:30:40.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a. Are your three levels below

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
college ready so that means you

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:43.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
have to take semester one

02:30:43.534 --> 02:30:44.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
semester to semester three.

02:30:44.969 --> 02:30:46.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Before you even got into English

02:30:46.937 --> 02:30:49.173 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
one a which was no guarantee

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:49.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
that you're going to pass

02:30:49.774 --> 02:30:50.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
English when I.

02:30:50.775 --> 02:30:51.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We go on and on and on you can

02:30:51.442 --> 02:30:53.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
see that you can see the

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:54.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
quagmire right.

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:55.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
With co requisite remediation

02:30:55.379 --> 02:30:57.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
you're placed.

02:30:57.081 --> 02:30:59.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Along with the other folks in

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
English when a but instead of

02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:03.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
whoever died and said you can on

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:03.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
you know you'll have take

02:31:03.821 --> 02:31:04.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
English. Three hours a week.

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:06.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
There are some of us who need

02:31:06.857 --> 02:31:08.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
five hours a week right so there

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:09.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
there may be that the regular

02:31:09.393 --> 02:31:11.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
three English three hours of

02:31:11.162 --> 02:31:13.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
English actor taking with

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
everyone else. And the

02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:15.399 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
additional two hours might be

02:31:15.466 --> 02:31:16.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
spent.

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Might be spent on to it onto

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:19.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Tauriel on as an additional

02:31:19.703 --> 02:31:21.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
assistance to make sure that you

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:23.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
get through because the course

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that you're taking has the exact

02:31:24.809 --> 02:31:26.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
same rigor. Has excel set

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:28.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
require the same requirements

02:31:28.813 --> 02:31:29.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as the other folks who got

02:31:29.346 --> 02:31:31.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
placed in there. So when we when

02:31:31.449 --> 02:31:32.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we look at the data that's what

02:31:32.917 --> 02:31:34.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
when assemblyman Arambula when

02:31:35.019 --> 02:31:35.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you look at the things about why

02:31:35.686 --> 02:31:37.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are we doing this well. And and

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:38.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what's true right so what work

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:40.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
so we are trying to scale that

02:31:40.925 --> 02:31:41.525 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
appear in the Central Valley so

02:31:41.592 --> 02:31:42.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that when young people get into

02:31:42.993 --> 02:31:44.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
college.

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:45.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Given to the community colleges

02:31:45.596 --> 02:31:46.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the third ever take or the CSU

02:31:47.031 --> 02:31:49.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
now that they literally are able

02:31:49.467 --> 02:31:50.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
to get through the gate we

02:31:50.801 --> 02:31:52.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
courses and then get on get on a

02:31:52.770 --> 02:31:54.738 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
with life. So that's that's one

02:31:54.805 --> 02:31:55.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of the things that we're doing

02:31:55.439 --> 02:31:56.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
here in the Central Valley the

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:59.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
other one is fifty to finish

02:31:59.243 --> 02:31:59.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
such as that.

02:31:59.577 --> 02:32:01.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I under spoke to it and and he

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:01.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
said you know.

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:04.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
There are some folks who can't

02:32:04.849 --> 02:32:05.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
do it and that's true what we

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:07.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
don't want to do it you don't

02:32:07.184 --> 02:32:08.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
want to diminish those folks.

02:32:08.986 --> 02:32:10.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Who can't attend school time I'm

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:12.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
a school full time there are

02:32:13.023 --> 02:32:14.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
folks who can't go to school

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:16.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
full time we understand that?

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:17.561 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But we also understand I think

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Debbie Cochran mentioned when

02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:21.432 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you look at the research the

02:32:21.499 --> 02:32:21.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
research says.

02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:23.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Students who are going to school

02:32:23.267 --> 02:32:24.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
full time.

02:32:24.802 --> 02:32:27.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
By completing and the clean

02:32:27.104 --> 02:32:28.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
completing faster.

02:32:28.906 --> 02:32:30.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Time is a horrible but can you

02:32:31.008 --> 02:32:33.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
imagine if we could get kids

02:32:33.210 --> 02:32:34.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
risk through through university

02:32:34.678 --> 02:32:35.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
through the communicative

02:32:35.212 --> 02:32:37.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
university in four four and a

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:40.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
half years five years Max.

02:32:40.818 --> 02:32:41.252 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Versus seven or eight.

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:41.886 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Can you much of the savings to

02:32:41.952 --> 02:32:43.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the state of California that we

02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:45.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
could direct to other things

02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:46.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that we do so well our our

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:48.726 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
recommendation is that we one of

02:32:48.792 --> 02:32:49.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the recommendations would be.

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:50.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Are giving back to the co

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:52.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
requisite remediation that since

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:54.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
it's now becoming a part of

02:32:54.865 --> 02:32:55.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
what's what what is transforming

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:57.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the colleges is that. We really

02:32:57.401 --> 02:32:59.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
look at a professional learning

02:32:59.303 --> 02:33:01.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and opportunities for folks as

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:04.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we as we. Are are faculties are

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
being asked to change the very

02:33:06.810 --> 02:33:08.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
way they do what they do. Off

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
after having done things one way

02:33:11.015 --> 02:33:12.883 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
for a long time and it'll take

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:13.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
awhile to two one.

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To implement these things so we

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:17.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
look at fifteen to finish what

02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:19.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we're trying to get young people

02:33:19.089 --> 02:33:20.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
to not only up.

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:23.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Get full to get their financial

02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:23.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
aid and you've heard all about

02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:24.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
minutes allowing you to that.

02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:25.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Get all the financial aid get

02:33:25.496 --> 02:33:28.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the benefits from that from both

02:33:28.966 --> 02:33:29.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
services the county another sort

02:33:29.633 --> 02:33:31.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
of things. To give you the

02:33:31.101 --> 02:33:33.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
opportunity to attend full time

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
if you possibly if you possibly

02:33:35.005 --> 02:33:36.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
can are others are other

02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:37.441 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
strategies that would be a

02:33:37.508 --> 02:33:39.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
recommendation is that the

02:33:39.109 --> 02:33:40.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
legislature seriously to take a

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:42.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
look. At a LA longitudinal data

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
sharing platform.

02:33:44.815 --> 02:33:46.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That would allow us to share

02:33:46.951 --> 02:33:48.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
clout a data from the other que

02:33:49.019 --> 02:33:50.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
que arcade twelve partners to

02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:52.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the community college to see if

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:54.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you can the CSU. Right now their

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
individual their individual

02:33:56.794 --> 02:33:57.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
cycles that exist out there and

02:33:57.428 --> 02:33:59.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
it doesn't make any sense to us

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:01.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and it's difficult for us to get

02:34:01.131 --> 02:34:03.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that data if we can follow kid.

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:05.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
From from the six grade through

02:34:05.269 --> 02:34:07.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
the high school into the

02:34:07.171 --> 02:34:08.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
community college. And and

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:09.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
literally have the parents also

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
following by by the way by have

02:34:11.175 --> 02:34:13.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the parents follow have the

02:34:13.310 --> 02:34:14.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students follow we can do that

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:15.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
there are there are there it's

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:17.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
out there it's simply a matter.

02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:18.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Of of doing that.

02:34:18.949 --> 02:34:21.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And then the other strategies

02:34:21.218 --> 02:34:21.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
egg and you've heard the other

02:34:21.852 --> 02:34:24.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
efforts to to guided pathways.

02:34:24.755 --> 02:34:26.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So we're implementing guided

02:34:26.724 --> 02:34:27.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
pathways across across the

02:34:27.291 --> 02:34:28.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
valley all of our colleges and

02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:30.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
universities including our our

02:34:30.861 --> 02:34:32.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CSU do you see where all and are

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:34.932 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
independent of France. All are

02:34:34.999 --> 02:34:36.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
are all picking up the the

02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:38.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
guided pathways because I think

02:34:38.869 --> 02:34:40.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
all I think senator of senator

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:41.505 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Alben spoke about the wraparound

02:34:41.572 --> 02:34:42.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
services.

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:43.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But the university of California

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:45.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
kids get.

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:47.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Which is wonderful but again

02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:47.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
everybody is everybody in all

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:48.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
it's all.

02:34:49.013 --> 02:34:51.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So it's not good for you see

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:53.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
kids why isn't a good for like

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:55.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
other kids right so with with

02:34:55.352 --> 02:34:55.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what the four pillars with the

02:34:55.986 --> 02:34:58.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
four pillars of. Of book of love

02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:00.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
of guided pathways so one

02:35:01.025 --> 02:35:02.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
doesn't take.

02:35:02.926 --> 02:35:04.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The not caring getting through

02:35:04.795 --> 02:35:05.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and get in them and it didn't

02:35:05.462 --> 02:35:07.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
take into other hunter spoke

02:35:07.331 --> 02:35:08.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about. Going through these these

02:35:08.899 --> 02:35:11.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
horrible website and tried to so

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:12.736 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
of getting kids to and the other

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:13.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thing that's what you've got no

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
man has to get up to select a

02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:16.907 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
path I'm Amanda major. A

02:35:16.974 --> 02:35:19.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
direction in which they're going

02:35:19.143 --> 02:35:20.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to go the other one and then

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:22.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
another pillars to literally

02:35:22.913 --> 02:35:23.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
literally give them the

02:35:23.447 --> 02:35:24.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
intrinsic student services we

02:35:24.782 --> 02:35:25.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
heard about one two three

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
thousand of its counselor.

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:29.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Student ratio twenty fifteen

02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:30.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
hundred to really literally put

02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
some services to some dollars

02:35:33.023 --> 02:35:34.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
fifty for like recommendations

02:35:34.825 --> 02:35:37.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
up. Up with respect to retrieve

02:35:37.227 --> 02:35:38.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
sixteen services to make sure

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:39.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
that the students. At the

02:35:39.263 --> 02:35:43.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
community colleges. For instance

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:46.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
are getting both her parents for

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:49.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Mrs that the kids at the

02:35:49.106 --> 02:35:50.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
university of California and

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:52.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
then the other is the one I was

02:35:52.976 --> 02:35:54.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
talking about awhile ago. Which

02:35:54.945 --> 02:35:58.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
is the wrapped the up the

02:35:58.849 --> 02:36:00.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
professional learning to make

02:36:00.984 --> 02:36:02.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
sure that learning this taking

02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:04.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
place and that faculty are given

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:08.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
an opportunity for professional

02:36:08.859 --> 02:36:10.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
learning. Do you know I used ice

02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:15.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
to be a K. twelve god I suggest

02:36:15.099 --> 02:36:15.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
you pretended by school district

02:36:15.766 --> 02:36:17.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
before I went to the

02:36:17.134 --> 02:36:20.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
communicative. I used to more

02:36:20.871 --> 02:36:22.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
professional development and

02:36:22.973 --> 02:36:26.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
training with my K. twelve

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:28.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
teachers.

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:29.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
They're not our community

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:29.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
college folks ever got.

02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:30.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Does it make any sense.

02:36:30.948 --> 02:36:31.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So I mean work so anyway.

02:36:31.482 --> 02:36:33.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That's what we are that's what

02:36:33.117 --> 02:36:33.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
we're doing here in the Central

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:34.251 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Valley and we're doing it

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:36.687 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
because we believe first I
missed Medina.

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:36.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Thank you.

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:40.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Mister chair so I am assembly

02:36:40.724 --> 02:36:42.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
member Jose Medina. I represent.

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Another part of the in that part

02:36:45.262 --> 02:36:46.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
of the state of California. I

02:36:46.997 --> 02:36:48.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
represent the Inland Empire

02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:50.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
riverside Moreno valley and the

02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
city of Paris.

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:55.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Similar to the area where we are

02:36:55.272 --> 02:36:57.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
right now we have a very low.

02:36:57.241 --> 02:37:00.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
College going rate.

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:01.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I think that with the Central

02:37:01.378 --> 02:37:03.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Valley the Inland Empire the

02:37:03.147 --> 02:37:06.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Lois college going rate in the

02:37:06.884 --> 02:37:08.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
state of California.

02:37:08.786 --> 02:37:13.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I was around in the sixties.

02:37:13.090 --> 02:37:14.691 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Matter of fact in nineteen sixty

02:37:14.758 --> 02:37:15.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
eight I I was a freshman in high

02:37:15.425 --> 02:37:16.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
school.

02:37:16.794 --> 02:37:21.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So I I sure that with the doctor

02:37:21.131 --> 02:37:22.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
do not.

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:23.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I say that because I was

02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:24.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
also a history teacher.

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:27.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Today in the capital we did a

02:37:27.104 --> 02:37:28.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
press conference.

02:37:29.006 --> 02:37:30.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
To date March first.

02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:33.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Thousand.

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:37:35.012 --> 02:37:36.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Eighteen is the fiftieth

02:37:36.947 --> 02:37:38.949 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
anniversary.

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:40.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The fiftieth anniversary.

Alejandro and Manuel may not be

Sal Castro.

02:38:01.138 --> 02:38:05.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The teacher who I had the

02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:06.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
opportunity to meet. I had the

02:38:06.977 --> 02:38:07.477 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
opportunity to bring to my

02:38:07.544 --> 02:38:08.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
classroom.

02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:10.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
It you gotta studies.

My gonna studies classroom in

02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:13.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the high school and I bring it

02:38:13.650 --> 02:38:15.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
up because I heard a the handle

02:38:15.419 --> 02:38:17.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and men will talk about. The

02:38:17.087 --> 02:38:19.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
importance of teachers and

02:38:19.423 --> 02:38:22.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
counselors that look like that.

02:38:22.759 --> 02:38:24.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Like students and I bring it up

02:38:25.028 --> 02:38:27.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
because I here Michelle seek

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:27.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
ghettos.

02:38:27.464 --> 02:38:30.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Talking about.

02:38:30.968 --> 02:38:31.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Our students still not being

02:38:31.568 --> 02:38:34.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
admitted I hear Michelle talking

02:38:34.838 --> 02:38:35.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
about.

02:38:35.072 --> 02:38:37.474 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Faculty not looking like the

02:38:37.541 --> 02:38:40.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
students not not been enough

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:42.846 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Latino faculty not having
enough.

02:38:42.913 --> 02:38:44.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Latino administrators not

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:48.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
having enough Latinos on the

02:38:48.852 --> 02:38:50.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
regions of the UC. On the board

02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:55.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of trustees of the CSU of the.

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:55.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Community college.

02:38:55.626 --> 02:38:57.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
And guess what.

02:38:57.127 --> 02:39:00.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Those demands of those students

02:39:00.898 --> 02:39:01.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
fifty years ago.

02:39:01.298 --> 02:39:03.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Are the same things that we are

02:39:03.333 --> 02:39:06.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
talking about today.

02:39:06.837 --> 02:39:07.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The same things those were the

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:09.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
issues that those students

02:39:09.072 --> 02:39:11.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
talked about exact the same

02:39:11.074 --> 02:39:12.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
things.

02:39:12.743 --> 02:39:14.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
So I I don't say that to

02:39:15.045 --> 02:39:16.880 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
discourage us.

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:19.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I actually say that we need

02:39:19.249 --> 02:39:20.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
their energy.

02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:23.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
The energy that those students

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:24.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
have and I. Think we do have a.

02:39:24.855 --> 02:39:29.092 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
Right alone.

02:39:29.159 --> 02:39:30.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And they were successful.

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:31.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Even though here we are fifty

02:39:31.662 --> 02:39:32.896 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
years later and we're talking

02:39:32.963 --> 02:39:34.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
about some of the. Things that

02:39:35.065 --> 02:39:37.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we don't have they were actually

02:39:37.167 --> 02:39:37.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
were successful.

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:40.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
They they change a culture in

02:39:41.004 --> 02:39:43.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
Los Angeles.

02:39:43.073 --> 02:39:44.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Where? No one really expected.

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:46.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
Us.

02:39:46.977 --> 02:39:48.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Latinos to go to college the

02:39:48.812 --> 02:39:50.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
change that they turned around

02:39:50.981 --> 02:39:52.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and they did it dramatically. In

02:39:52.816 --> 02:39:54.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the number of students that they

02:39:55.018 --> 02:39:55.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
were able to change

02:39:55.452 --> 02:39:58.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they affected. Us a movement.

02:39:58.889 --> 02:40:02.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That. Change now. That made it

02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:04.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
possible for me to be in the

02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:05.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
state legislature.

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:07.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Right aye think they created a

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:09.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
movement that that every single

02:40:09.299 --> 02:40:12.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Latino who's ever served in the

02:40:12.903 --> 02:40:14.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
state legislature. Up close.

02:40:14.705 --> 02:40:17.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

02:40:17.107 --> 02:40:18.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
But.

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:20.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I I think it's it's good that we

02:40:21.011 --> 02:40:21.611 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
take a moment to reflect on
that.

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:22.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

02:40:22.913 --> 02:40:25.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And also do use their example to

02:40:25.215 --> 02:40:26.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
do better.

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:29.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Because. Even though there is

02:40:29.386 --> 02:40:30.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
much that that we need to

02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:33.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
improve the lot.

02:40:33.123 --> 02:40:34.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
There is never been a time

02:40:34.891 --> 02:40:36.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
where we've had more Latinos in

02:40:36.760 --> 02:40:39.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
higher education more Latinos in

02:40:39.196 --> 02:40:42.766 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
you see or Latinos and see
issue.

02:40:42.833 --> 02:40:45.402 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
And and I will quote. Sal
Castro.

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:47.371 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And I will quote would settle

02:40:47.437 --> 02:40:49.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Castro said when he came to my

02:40:49.239 --> 02:40:51.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
cast my classrooms. Nosair been

02:40:51.141 --> 02:40:52.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
they hope.

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:55.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
If you knew Sau Castro that's

02:40:55.312 --> 02:40:55.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
who he talked.

02:40:55.679 --> 02:40:59.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
You don't go to college.

02:40:59.149 --> 02:40:59.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And about the bottleneck in

02:40:59.750 --> 02:41:00.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
community college I was a

02:41:00.917 --> 02:41:03.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
community college trustee for

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:04.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
thirteen years.

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:08.625 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
But it's clear it's obvious
that.

02:41:08.692 --> 02:41:10.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Something's gone wrong with

02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:13.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
community college if the

02:41:13.330 --> 02:41:14.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
majority of Latinos.

02:41:14.898 --> 02:41:16.933 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Who are in community colleges

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
are not being able to? Go to

02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
four year colleges

02:41:20.771 --> 02:41:24.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
you know I went to college.

02:41:25.008 --> 02:41:25.642 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
My daughter graduated from U. S.

02:41:25.709 --> 02:41:31.048 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
C. on a graduate of UC
riverside.

02:41:31.114 --> 02:41:33.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We both got out in four years

02:41:33.183 --> 02:41:34.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and that's because we both had

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:36.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the opportunity to you to be

02:41:36.953 --> 02:41:37.320 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
full time students.

02:41:37.387 --> 02:41:39.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And not have to worry about a

02:41:39.189 --> 02:41:41.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
lot of the things that I've

02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:41.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
heard the students in the first

02:41:41.825 --> 02:41:44.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
panel have to worry about.

02:41:44.728 --> 02:41:45.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
But that is what college is

02:41:45.328 --> 02:41:48.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
meant to be I think college and

02:41:49.066 --> 02:41:51.034 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we as a state a California. Need

02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:52.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
to do better.

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I chair the committee on higher

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:56.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
education I am the subcommittee.

02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:58.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Of on the budget for higher

02:41:59.009 --> 02:42:02.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
education it is disgraceful.

02:42:02.846 --> 02:42:04.581 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I think it is disgraceful the.

02:42:04.648 --> 02:42:07.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Amount of money that we invest

02:42:07.517 --> 02:42:09.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in higher education and so I

02:42:09.152 --> 02:42:11.188 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
make the point that at the time

02:42:11.254 --> 02:42:13.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
were there are the most Latinos.

02:42:13.223 --> 02:42:15.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Ever in the history of

02:42:15.425 --> 02:42:17.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
California and higher education

02:42:17.227 --> 02:42:20.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
it is disgraceful that we kind a

02:42:20.864 --> 02:42:22.899 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
nickel and dime higher
education.

02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:24.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I think we were probably

02:42:25.035 --> 02:42:25.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
teaching to the you know

02:42:25.569 --> 02:42:27.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
preaching to the choir here with

02:42:27.170 --> 02:42:29.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
my colleagues but. It's up to

02:42:29.139 --> 02:42:30.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
you.

02:42:31.007 --> 02:42:32.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Its up to you as students to put

02:42:32.976 --> 02:42:34.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
pressure. On us to do better so

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:40.650 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
thank you.

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:42.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
The user Medina.

02:42:42.919 --> 02:42:44.688 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And the other are questions or

02:42:44.754 --> 02:42:46.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
comments from colleagues.

02:42:46.723 --> 02:42:47.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I know nobody it's it's hard to

02:42:53.029 --> 02:42:55.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

limit it to three.

02:45:37.727 --> 02:45:38.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
First of all.

02:45:38.728 --> 02:45:41.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Senate bill fourteen forty was

02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:43.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:46.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
It established a student

accepted up or year CSU system.

02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:59.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Somehow some way.

02:45:59.182 --> 02:46:01.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Institutions community colleges

02:46:01.151 --> 02:46:01.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
did not include.

02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:04.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Say for example. Ethnic studies

02:46:04.954 --> 02:46:06.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Chicano Latino studies

02:46:06.756 --> 02:46:08.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
so Senate Billboard for forty

02:46:09.025 --> 02:46:10.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
was passed.

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:13.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Senate for forty says required

02:46:13.129 --> 02:46:16.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the creation of for transfer

02:46:16.966 --> 02:46:17.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
model curriculum templates.

02:46:17.534 --> 02:46:19.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That allow students a broader

02:46:19.102 --> 02:46:21.304 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
area of study than previously

02:46:21.371 --> 02:46:22.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
available to other associate

02:46:23.039 --> 02:46:24.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
degrees for transfer.

02:46:24.908 --> 02:46:27.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It was passed in two thousand

02:46:27.210 --> 02:46:29.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thirteen yet some community

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
colleges.

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:32.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We need accountability from you

02:46:32.949 --> 02:46:34.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Mr Medina said.

02:46:34.818 --> 02:46:37.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
That community colleges pass

02:46:37.087 --> 02:46:38.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
implement this bill.

02:46:38.922 --> 02:46:43.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And not say all students are not

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:43.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
interested in Chicano Latino

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:45.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
studies are not in ruling

02:46:45.295 --> 02:46:45.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
because

02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:47.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
not part of the sixty transfer

02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:48.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
units.

02:46:48.932 --> 02:46:51.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You need to tell them have you

02:46:51.067 --> 02:46:51.634 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
implemented what is already on

02:46:51.701 --> 02:46:56.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
the books.

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:00.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Recommendation to. The master

02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:01.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
plan comments have been made

02:47:01.511 --> 02:47:03.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

02:47:03.079 --> 02:47:03.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
others.

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:04.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
About.

02:47:04.948 --> 02:47:07.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Affirmative action which I call

permitted action in the hiring.

02:47:09.052 --> 02:47:10.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We have institutions that four

02:47:11.020 --> 02:47:12.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
year colleges.

02:47:13.056 --> 02:47:16.693 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
A nearby use CSU.

02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:19.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That says it all well are. We

02:47:19.095 --> 02:47:21.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
have to have. Only ten year.

02:47:21.131 --> 02:47:22.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
Teachers.

02:47:22.766 --> 02:47:25.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Tenured professors on the

fair that's not equity.

02:47:28.972 --> 02:47:30.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You need across it you can't

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:39.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
one. With that degree.

02:47:39.449 --> 02:47:40.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
That is tenure.

02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:42.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%

02:48:31.201 --> 02:48:32.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%

02:48:32.769 --> 02:48:35.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Finally I like to reiterate that

02:48:35.138 --> 02:48:36.773 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

the valley on the CSU the UC

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:46.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

02:48:47.016 --> 02:48:47.584 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
community college or a board of

02:48:47.650 --> 02:48:48.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
governors.

02:48:48.885 --> 02:48:50.587 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

The reading.

02:49:13.009 --> 02:49:13.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I was a little bit about my

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:14.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
background.

02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:17.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
School and my title years of

02:49:17.347 --> 02:49:18.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
living up.

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:19.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Where other read and write to

02:49:19.315 --> 02:49:22.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
the?

02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:23.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
This is a topic that I've been

02:49:23.453 --> 02:49:25.054 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
with me through it.

02:49:25.121 --> 02:49:26.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Unfortunately for some time

02:49:26.856 --> 02:49:27.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
before it hits college and I saw

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:28.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
that it.

02:49:29.025 --> 02:49:29.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It a lot more students than I

02:49:29.626 --> 02:49:31.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
was used to.

02:49:31.127 --> 02:49:32.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
Irvine.

02:49:33.029 --> 02:49:33.563 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I really affluent area where

02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:34.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
this is

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:37.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
under wraps nobody knew that any

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:37.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
of this going on.

02:49:37.734 --> 02:49:38.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Any friend.

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:41.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
As a junior in high school I

02:49:41.471 --> 02:49:42.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
had say give my mom money that

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:44.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
it.

02:49:44.741 --> 02:49:46.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A job orders to cover right.

02:49:46.776 --> 02:49:47.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I and my senior year as my

02:49:47.343 --> 02:49:48.711 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
situation I got words.

02:49:48.778 --> 02:49:51.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And conversations of evictions

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:53.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
turned into threats at least

02:49:53.249 --> 02:49:54.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
coming through it or having a

02:49:55.018 --> 02:49:56.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
struggle with looking for it.

02:49:56.886 --> 02:49:57.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I've the future and I barely

02:49:57.487 --> 02:49:58.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
nearly gave it up to a.

02:49:58.988 --> 02:50:00.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
I didn't I.

02:50:00.890 --> 02:50:02.725 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
Here and now.

02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:03.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
One I attended UCSB I was

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.161 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
fortunate enough to qualify for

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:05.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
how come.

02:50:05.495 --> 02:50:07.096 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And was able to have a more

02:50:07.163 --> 02:50:07.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
stable and wood living situation

02:50:07.797 --> 02:50:08.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
that approved.

02:50:08.698 --> 02:50:11.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Which as Tim had mentioned in

02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:12.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
the previous an awful lot of

02:50:12.936 --> 02:50:13.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
students experience.

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:15.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Either way.

02:50:15.104 --> 02:50:17.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But that's just it I you know

02:50:17.273 --> 02:50:17.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
my securities based on the

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:18.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
amount of

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:18.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%

Apparently.

02:50:27.216 --> 02:50:27.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
My well being is based on the

02:50:27.817 --> 02:50:29.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
funding an expert

02:50:29.085 --> 02:50:31.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

That are suppose to be

02:50:41.397 --> 02:50:42.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
available to students.

our various groups on campus.

02:50:45.301 --> 02:50:47.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I from my experience however

02:50:47.403 --> 02:50:47.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
lobbying in Sacramento many

02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:49.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

02:50:59.682 --> 02:51:01.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
While I understand the reasoning

02:51:01.250 --> 02:51:01.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
behind it a very.

02:51:01.684 --> 02:51:05.355 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
It is very difficult to not

02:51:05.421 --> 02:51:05.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
feel as if they're true archer

02:51:06.055 --> 02:51:06.756 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

troubles as students.

02:51:09.058 --> 02:51:10.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I just as they can push it aside

02:51:10.994 --> 02:51:13.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
as he is trying to get involved

02:51:13.329 --> 02:51:14.897 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
in about it that they don't.

02:51:14.964 --> 02:51:15.531 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
That they don't understand these

02:51:15.598 --> 02:51:17.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
conversations.

02:51:17.066 --> 02:51:18.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
When in reality every single

02:51:18.968 --> 02:51:19.535 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
student I talked to understand

02:51:19.602 --> 02:51:20.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
it much better.

02:51:20.770 --> 02:51:23.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That people up in the level

exact.

02:51:24.874 --> 02:51:25.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
These are the lives they live

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:26.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
there not

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%

02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:45.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
they not just listen to our

02:51:45.395 --> 02:51:46.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
voices.

02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And to not their interests

02:51:47.597 --> 02:51:49.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ten years from now with the

02:51:49.132 --> 02:51:51.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
renewal of the master plan. I

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:52.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
would actively fight for the

02:51:53.002 --> 02:51:53.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
needs of college students on

02:51:53.636 --> 02:51:55.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
housewares in a committee

02:51:55.071 --> 02:51:55.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
meetings and in your districts

02:51:55.672 --> 02:51:56.739 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
and

02:51:56.806 --> 02:51:58.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
to enact real change.

02:51:58.841 --> 02:52:00.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
I think he's.

02:52:00.743 --> 02:52:04.881 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Thank you know.

02:52:04.947 --> 02:52:05.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
And next of his mere.

02:52:05.415 --> 02:52:12.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
So Valley health.

02:52:12.955 --> 02:52:14.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Need and thank you for.

02:52:14.957 --> 02:52:16.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Holding this committee hearing

02:52:16.726 --> 02:52:25.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
here I live in Fresno of our

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:26.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
organization is headquartered in

02:52:26.102 --> 02:52:26.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Sacramento and I can tell you

02:52:26.703 --> 02:52:27.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
many times I have to travel to

02:52:27.336 --> 02:52:27.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Los Angeles o'quinn for

02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:28.404 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Sacramento. To attend meetings

02:52:28.471 --> 02:52:29.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
where I learned about the issues

02:52:29.205 --> 02:52:29.772 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we here in the Central Valley

02:52:29.839 --> 02:52:31.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
say really appreciate you being

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:32.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
here today. And I represent the

02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:33.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Central Valley health network

02:52:33.409 --> 02:52:34.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
which is a consortium of

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:36.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
fourteen community health

02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:37.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
centers so I don't working

02:52:37.413 --> 02:52:39.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
education but we do a lot of

02:52:39.415 --> 02:52:41.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
work around work force and while

02:52:41.217 --> 02:52:42.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I recognize the committee had a

02:52:42.885 --> 02:52:44.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hearing. In San Jose around work

02:52:44.987 --> 02:52:47.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
force I still think that we want

02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:48.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to bring home the fact that

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:49.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
meeting the needs of students

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:51.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
also means making sure. That the

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
programs that exist in our

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:55.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
education our going to prepare

02:52:55.331 --> 02:52:57.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
those students for terminal

02:52:57.200 --> 02:52:58.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
degrees or certificates that

02:52:58.968 --> 02:53:00.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
provide them with the skills and

02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:02.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
knowledge that they need. To get

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:05.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
living wage career jobs so often

02:53:05.141 --> 02:53:06.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
we hear about students

02:53:06.876 --> 02:53:08.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
especially in the valley UC

02:53:08.845 --> 02:53:11.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Merced graduates at Sandra. That

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:12.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are having to take minimum wage

02:53:12.982 --> 02:53:16.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
jobs on in places like target or

02:53:16.753 --> 02:53:20.757 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Taco Bell and places like that.

02:53:20.823 --> 02:53:22.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'm and so we will feel that and

02:53:22.859 --> 02:53:24.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
we need to focus on

02:53:24.894 --> 02:53:25.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
problematically.

02:53:25.294 --> 02:53:26.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Something that we take into

02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:27.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
consideration as well I mean

02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:28.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that the cost of education

02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:29.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
should not outweigh the wages

02:53:29.298 --> 02:53:29.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that these students are going to

02:53:29.966 --> 02:53:31.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
be receiving when they enter the

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:33.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
workforce. And saddling them

02:53:33.402 --> 02:53:33.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
with such dad.

02:53:33.770 --> 02:53:35.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And doctor regular you know the

02:53:35.304 --> 02:53:37.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
shortage of. Health

02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:39.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
professionals that we have here

02:53:39.475 --> 02:53:40.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in the Central Valley on as well

02:53:40.176 --> 02:53:41.277 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as Mr Medina you have the same

02:53:41.344 --> 02:53:44.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thing in the Inland Empire and I

02:53:44.881 --> 02:53:45.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
in the. UC riverside along as

02:53:45.481 --> 02:53:46.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
well so.

02:53:46.783 --> 02:53:50.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Exactly and and so we have seen

02:53:50.753 --> 02:53:51.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that the impact that that has on

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:52.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
our ability to attract and

02:53:53.022 --> 02:53:55.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
retain. Even positions in this

02:53:55.191 --> 02:53:57.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
area because they can go to

02:53:57.493 --> 02:53:58.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
other areas and make more money

02:53:58.961 --> 02:53:59.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in order to pay off that student

02:53:59.595 --> 02:54:00.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
debt.

02:54:00.797 --> 02:54:03.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I also want to talk real quickly

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:05.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
about partnerships I keep with a

02:54:05.468 --> 02:54:07.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
colleague and we've had that

02:54:07.103 --> 02:54:09.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
workforce leans on because

02:54:09.372 --> 02:54:09.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
that's our work.

02:54:09.772 --> 02:54:10.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But what we were sitting here

02:54:10.873 --> 02:54:11.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
she had to leave she made the

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:12.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
suggestion that is you look at

02:54:12.775 --> 02:54:13.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
things like behavioral health

02:54:13.409 --> 02:54:15.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and and the shortage of. And

02:54:15.478 --> 02:54:17.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that high ratio of counselors to

02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:19.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students when not tap into

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:21.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
partners in the community such

02:54:21.083 --> 02:54:21.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
as the federally qualified

02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:23.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
health centers. To have

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:24.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
behavioral health services and

02:54:25.054 --> 02:54:25.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
other services that they're

02:54:25.655 --> 02:54:27.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
providing to the communities

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:29.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
they're very closely located in

02:54:29.192 --> 02:54:31.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
many cases to the universities

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:32.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and maybe if they collaborate

02:54:32.695 --> 02:54:34.764 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
together a group of them. Along

02:54:34.831 --> 02:54:37.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
with the education system bill

02:54:37.133 --> 02:54:38.734 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
might be able to help meet some

02:54:38.801 --> 02:54:40.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
of those needs without just

02:54:41.003 --> 02:54:42.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
fully rely on the government.

02:54:42.939 --> 02:54:43.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
So again thank you.

02:54:43.372 --> 02:54:46.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Thank you and much.

02:54:46.742 --> 02:54:48.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Next up is doctor Joseph Jones

02:54:48.945 --> 02:54:56.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
followed by Lucy Ruiz.

02:54:57.053 --> 02:54:59.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Thank you all for given the

02:54:59.088 --> 02:55:00.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
opportunity I just felt that.

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:01.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I have a responsibility to be

02:55:01.591 --> 02:55:02.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
say something.

02:55:02.758 --> 02:55:04.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I that may be missing out of

02:55:04.994 --> 02:55:07.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
president of Fresno Pacific

02:55:07.330 --> 02:55:08.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
university.

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:09.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And what at first I'm new to the

02:55:09.665 --> 02:55:13.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
state when I came. I was told

02:55:13.135 --> 02:55:14.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
that. It the grand plan of

02:55:14.804 --> 02:55:15.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
California which is

02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:16.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
best educate.

02:55:16.873 --> 02:55:19.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Was a poor legacy do you all

02:55:19.375 --> 02:55:21.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
have for it this.

02:55:21.077 --> 02:55:22.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The at community colleges. It's

02:55:22.745 --> 02:55:25.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
the I see it you see. And the

02:55:25.414 --> 02:55:26.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
independence.

02:55:26.883 --> 02:55:28.885 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And so as we're looking at this

02:55:28.951 --> 02:55:30.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
massive and I'm hoping. That we

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:32.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
don't forget IV independence

02:55:32.655 --> 02:55:35.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I have to look in terms of just

02:55:35.324 --> 02:55:36.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the data twenty two percent of

02:55:36.959 --> 02:55:38.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
the bachelor degrees. Awarded in

02:55:39.028 --> 02:55:41.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
the state come from the

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:41.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
independence to about seventy

02:55:41.864 --> 02:55:42.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
eight of us.

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:45.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You six fifty four percent I

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:46.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
think it's fifty to a fifty four

02:55:46.903 --> 02:55:48.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent of the mask agrees I

02:55:48.938 --> 02:55:50.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
come from the independence.

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Fifty four percent. Of the five

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:55.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
doctors coming from being

02:55:55.211 --> 02:55:56.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Vincent back about what happens

02:55:56.913 --> 02:55:59.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
when the independence.

02:55:59.148 --> 02:55:59.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
May have become.

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:01.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Stifle or handicapped in some

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
way and quite often they are not

02:56:03.352 --> 02:56:04.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
matches in bachelor programs are

02:56:05.054 --> 02:56:08.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
supported by what what comes.

about how can we are to have any

02:57:44.887 --> 02:57:48.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
impact. On this ballot. Up for

02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:49.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the students that I in this

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:50.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

I'm biggest buildup to Merced.

02:57:53.095 --> 02:57:55.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So how can we have to work

02:57:55.297 --> 02:57:55.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
together I do do that and not

02:57:55.898 --> 02:57:57.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
trying to are compete globally

02:57:57.199 --> 02:57:59.235 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
working up the have impact. I

02:57:59.301 --> 02:58:01.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
think that. As you think about

02:58:01.270 --> 02:58:03.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the master plan on who else is

02:58:03.339 --> 02:58:04.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
doing it

02:58:04.774 --> 02:58:05.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
yeah I guess of new.

02:58:05.241 --> 02:58:07.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
But I think it's a great idea if

02:58:07.143 --> 02:58:08.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
you really are trying to have.

02:58:08.811 --> 02:58:10.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Impact on education I also this

02:58:11.013 --> 02:58:13.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and I'll and I'll the yeah I

02:58:13.115 --> 02:58:15.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
worked in the I would be a city.

02:58:15.117 --> 02:58:15.684 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Feel just as I was a professor

02:58:15.751 --> 02:58:18.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
in that particular field by

02:58:18.854 --> 02:58:20.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
working I feel years

02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:21.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
as always thinking a reason why

02:58:21.557 --> 02:58:23.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I've connected with education

02:58:23.225 --> 02:58:23.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
and just.

02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:25.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
By the up you'll probably have

02:58:25.294 --> 02:58:25.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
seen the reports because it came

02:58:25.928 --> 02:58:26.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
from legislative legislative

02:58:26.996 --> 02:58:27.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

seventy thousand dollars a year.

02:58:32.835 --> 02:58:34.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Fought in makes in prison.

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:35.504 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That's what we're spent. So as

02:58:35.571 --> 02:58:37.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
we think about education and

02:58:37.339 --> 02:58:38.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
investing.

02:58:39.041 --> 02:58:41.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Well we should be acting up be

that what I'm about to say it's

03:01:10.793 --> 03:01:11.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
not just another comment that

to drive about.

03:01:17.066 --> 03:01:20.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%

Mattress yeah you see.

03:01:22.838 --> 03:01:24.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
You see I I worked three jobs

to make sure I wouldn't have to

03:01:25.441 --> 03:01:26.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
take out any loans.

03:01:26.842 --> 03:01:29.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

think.

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:54.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

thirty park twenty minutes away

03:02:05.114 --> 03:02:06.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
so you pay less for parking.

03:02:06.982 --> 03:02:08.984 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

.

03:02:36.845 --> 03:02:38.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yeah and US government relations

03:02:39.014 --> 03:02:39.615 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
director at high to make it upon

03:02:39.682 --> 03:02:41.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
myself to make sure that I every

03:02:41.483 --> 03:02:44.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
lobby core meeting. We have food

03:02:45.020 --> 03:02:47.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
so the students participating

03:02:47.222 --> 03:02:47.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ABA.

03:02:47.423 --> 03:02:49.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Some of them get at least one

03:02:49.224 --> 03:02:50.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
good meal an entire week.

03:02:50.859 --> 03:02:52.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I shouldn't have to do that.

03:02:53.062 --> 03:02:56.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:02:56.865 --> 03:02:59.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Because you know as tuition

03:02:59.134 --> 03:03:00.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
increase says we have a. We have

03:03:01.003 --> 03:03:02.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a proposed tuition increase vote

03:03:02.938 --> 03:03:04.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
coming up in.

03:03:04.873 --> 03:03:06.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I fishing increases fewer

03:03:06.842 --> 03:03:07.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
students from low income

03:03:07.376 --> 03:03:09.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
backgrounds apply even when they

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:10.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
are eligible for financial aid.

03:03:10.946 --> 03:03:11.447 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That thing about low income

03:03:11.513 --> 03:03:13.248 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students is that we need so much

03:03:13.315 --> 03:03:15.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
more than just. Financial way

03:03:15.517 --> 03:03:17.152 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
there's so many things that

03:03:17.219 --> 03:03:18.721 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
comes with fees according travel

03:03:18.787 --> 03:03:21.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
up to get there I commute for

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:23.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
forty minutes if my parents had

03:03:23.492 --> 03:03:24.760 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
only their car I wouldn't be

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:26.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
able to make it to you see I.

03:03:26.695 --> 03:03:27.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
So there's so much more things

03:03:27.329 --> 03:03:29.198 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
than needs to be done and I

03:03:29.264 --> 03:03:30.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
think.

03:03:30.699 --> 03:03:32.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I think this is a first grade

03:03:32.868 --> 03:03:33.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
staff I am happy that this is

03:03:33.502 --> 03:03:35.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
something that would going and I

03:03:35.070 --> 03:03:37.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
hope moving forward it continues

03:03:37.139 --> 03:03:39.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
with even more momentum day

03:03:39.308 --> 03:03:40.943 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
house right now because I.

03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:42.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
This should be packed.

03:03:42.811 --> 03:03:42.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:44.747 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Yeah I I think there's

03:03:44.813 --> 03:03:46.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
something that needs to be done

03:03:46.982 --> 03:03:47.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
either from you all or I don't

03:03:47.616 --> 03:03:49.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
know anyone else but some things

03:03:49.184 --> 03:03:51.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
to be done to.

03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:52.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To be able to give a stipend or

03:03:52.888 --> 03:03:53.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
something to students to make it

03:03:53.589 --> 03:03:55.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
out to do things like this

03:03:55.257 --> 03:03:55.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because it is difficult for us

03:03:55.891 --> 03:03:56.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
to to do this.

03:03:56.725 --> 03:03:59.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'm not I think we have a key

03:03:59.395 --> 03:03:59.862 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
for other things that we

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:02.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ourselves experience. So.

03:04:02.831 --> 03:04:05.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
You know somethings from ya to

have us at the table.

03:04:06.735 --> 03:04:09.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I know you've heard this all

03:04:09.505 --> 03:04:10.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
before.

03:04:11.039 --> 03:04:12.975 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And I know this process is long

03:04:13.041 --> 03:04:13.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

Forgive me if I ramble of it aye

03:05:01.523 --> 03:05:04.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Andrew over three hundred.

03:05:05.027 --> 03:05:05.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Four hours of sleep to get.

03:05:05.594 --> 03:05:06.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
So little packet of this coffee

03:05:07.062 --> 03:05:08.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
in the back.

03:05:08.730 --> 03:05:10.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

03:05:11.033 --> 03:05:12.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
No who.

03:05:12.734 --> 03:05:14.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So little background on me I.

03:05:14.937 --> 03:05:15.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:05:15.137 --> 03:05:18.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
There.

03:05:19.041 --> 03:05:19.508 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
I. Came here I was really

03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:20.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
interested in this.

03:05:21.043 --> 03:05:24.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I was I'm student I lived under.

03:05:24.847 --> 03:05:26.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
A pass of the fifteen.

03:05:27.049 --> 03:05:27.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
For several years because my

03:05:27.649 --> 03:05:28.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
parents were drug at.

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:30.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And I was holding first grade.

03:05:31.053 --> 03:05:32.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Again in fifth grade again and

03:05:33.021 --> 03:05:33.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
eleventh grade that college

03:05:33.589 --> 03:05:34.690 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
wasn't.

03:05:34.756 --> 03:05:37.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And that was something that I

03:05:37.392 --> 03:05:38.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
really internalized M..

03:05:38.961 --> 03:05:41.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And it really her and I never

03:05:41.129 --> 03:05:41.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
thought I would be at a you see

03:05:41.763 --> 03:05:42.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and I would be if.

03:05:42.865 --> 03:05:43.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Student leader.

03:05:43.232 --> 03:05:44.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
But here I am.

03:05:44.867 --> 03:05:47.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
One of the things that I think

03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:49.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
is important to know is that we

03:05:49.204 --> 03:05:49.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
do have a seat here funding

03:05:49.771 --> 03:05:50.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
issue.

03:05:50.772 --> 03:05:52.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:05:52.875 --> 03:05:55.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
When I hear a tuition increases

03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:57.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and then I look at like the sea

03:05:57.346 --> 03:05:57.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
otter reportedly

03:05:57.713 --> 03:05:59.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I see office of the president I

03:05:59.181 --> 03:06:01.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
get extremely fast.

03:06:01.083 --> 03:06:03.185 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Because I have to make that

03:06:03.252 --> 03:06:03.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
choice in order to come here I'd

03:06:03.886 --> 03:06:04.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
exhaust.

03:06:04.987 --> 03:06:09.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
The cast.

03:06:09.091 --> 03:06:09.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And we're actually Kiley rented

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:11.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
aye aye.

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:11.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Absolutely exhausted my bank

03:06:11.660 --> 03:06:12.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
account to get here today.

03:06:12.728 --> 03:06:15.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So it's really hard for me.

03:06:15.264 --> 03:06:15.697 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Knowing that I'm not.

03:06:15.764 --> 03:06:16.765 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
We able.

03:06:16.832 --> 03:06:21.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And when I get frustrated when

03:06:21.103 --> 03:06:21.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
aye we to get food or other

03:06:21.703 --> 03:06:23.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
resources.

03:06:23.138 --> 03:06:25.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Yes I get will growl.

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:27.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And I look at myself and I

03:06:27.376 --> 03:06:28.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
realize I'm one of the lucky

03:06:28.810 --> 03:06:29.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
so I was a C. C. transparent.

03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:31.246 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Aye was one of the lucky ninety

03:06:31.313 --> 03:06:32.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
two percent that actually got

03:06:32.881 --> 03:06:34.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
through. I'm in the reason why

03:06:34.917 --> 03:06:36.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
as I took seventeen to twenty

03:06:37.019 --> 03:06:37.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
five units every quarter. Or

03:06:37.586 --> 03:06:40.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
every semester.

03:06:40.856 --> 03:06:42.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
She Dillon roll into community

03:06:43.025 --> 03:06:43.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
colleges in order to

03:06:43.458 --> 03:06:44.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
I'm over an admissions.

03:06:44.960 --> 03:06:45.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Because I have and taking care

03:06:45.594 --> 03:06:46.795 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
my grandma who is can't.

03:06:46.862 --> 03:06:49.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
And I understood that if I

03:06:49.131 --> 03:06:49.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
didn't get my

03:06:49.464 --> 03:06:52.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
I agree I would be.

03:06:52.968 --> 03:06:54.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And it's so when you're looking

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:56.805 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
at legislation I urge you to

03:06:56.872 --> 03:06:57.406 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
remember that all of you all

03:06:57.472 --> 03:06:58.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
most likely have always had act.

03:06:58.874 --> 03:07:01.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Those

03:07:01.143 --> 03:07:01.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
you will never know the shame

03:07:01.743 --> 03:07:03.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
and degradation going into first

03:07:03.145 --> 03:07:06.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grade being taken very ending.

03:07:06.782 --> 03:07:07.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
That was my first real

03:07:07.282 --> 03:07:09.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
experience that happened again

03:07:09.418 --> 03:07:09.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
in third and fourth grade and it

03:07:10.052 --> 03:07:10.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
was awful.

03:07:10.886 --> 03:07:13.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And so coming to from a place

03:07:13.188 --> 03:07:15.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
about a lack of privilege it

03:07:15.257 --> 03:07:17.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
means a lot to be able to speak

03:07:17.225 --> 03:07:19.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
up and actually look at.

03:07:19.194 --> 03:07:19.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Senator for example in the eye

03:07:19.828 --> 03:07:21.363 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and say Hey this is me this is

03:07:21.430 --> 03:07:23.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
my name and I.

03:07:23.098 --> 03:07:25.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And then the closing remark that

03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:27.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I would really like to make is.

03:07:27.102 --> 03:07:27.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I don't know if I necessarily

03:07:27.703 --> 03:07:29.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
agree with a point made about

03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:31.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
fifteen to graduate plan and the

03:07:31.373 --> 03:07:33.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
only reason that I do I disagree

03:07:33.241 --> 03:07:34.843 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
with that.

03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:36.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I work extensively everything

03:07:36.778 --> 03:07:37.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
psycho need seventy miles

03:07:37.312 --> 03:07:38.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
because I do not.

03:07:38.914 --> 03:07:42.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
They riverside area.

03:07:42.818 --> 03:07:43.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I was almost home once again by

03:07:43.485 --> 03:07:44.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
my best friend and her family

03:07:44.119 --> 03:07:46.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
took me and so I was able to.

03:07:47.022 --> 03:07:47.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Live album in a very comfortable

03:07:47.656 --> 03:07:47.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
house

03:07:47.856 --> 03:07:48.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
duration but it's.

03:07:48.924 --> 03:07:52.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Everyday I

03:07:52.794 --> 03:07:54.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
how did your on him I going to

03:07:55.063 --> 03:07:55.530 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
eat warming up he began.

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:57.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And then when they get to

03:07:57.399 --> 03:07:58.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
school I work twelve to fifteen

03:07:58.066 --> 03:07:59.334 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
hour days every single day

03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:01.470 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sometimes I get home at three or

03:08:01.536 --> 03:08:03.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
four in the morning. And have to

03:08:03.238 --> 03:08:04.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
week of ATM and we go back.

03:08:04.940 --> 03:08:07.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So that's about a two hour drive

03:08:07.442 --> 03:08:07.743 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
his single day.

03:08:07.809 --> 03:08:08.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Really exhausting I don't get

03:08:08.410 --> 03:08:09.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
any additional support.

03:08:09.177 --> 03:08:11.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And I'm lucky if my financially

03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:13.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
coverage even a fraction of any

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:14.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
of the cost.

03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:15.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Especially because my car is

03:08:15.584 --> 03:08:17.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
eighteen years old I had a

03:08:17.352 --> 03:08:19.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
secret for years to Alaska

03:08:19.154 --> 03:08:21.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
hundred dollars.

03:08:21.089 --> 03:08:22.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
A paper. I'm an attack breaks

03:08:22.891 --> 03:08:24.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
down then high have.

03:08:24.893 --> 03:08:27.295 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I one of the lucky slick think

03:08:27.362 --> 03:08:29.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
about the person and I am lucky

03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:30.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
there so many students that have

03:08:31.066 --> 03:08:31.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
the exact same story the exact

03:08:31.667 --> 03:08:32.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
same

03:08:32.868 --> 03:08:33.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Akram. That aren't as lucky that

03:08:33.568 --> 03:08:35.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
will never ever get to step out

03:08:35.337 --> 03:08:36.838 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
on use.

03:08:36.905 --> 03:08:37.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
It's I really want children

03:08:37.506 --> 03:08:39.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
think about that when you look

03:08:39.341 --> 03:08:39.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
at budgets and release that were

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:40.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
more than just.

03:08:41.009 --> 03:08:46.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Just.

03:08:46.915 --> 03:08:49.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Next with a pro of was followed

03:08:49.084 --> 03:08:58.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
by LEN inquiry.

03:08:59.027 --> 03:08:59.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Good evening everyone and first

03:08:59.661 --> 03:09:01.063 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
of all I wanted to think.

03:09:01.129 --> 03:09:02.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Fresno City College for having

03:09:07.035 --> 03:09:08.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Because it means a lot to not

03:09:09.037 --> 03:09:11.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
just me but every person here is

03:09:11.206 --> 03:09:13.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
here for a reason and they know

03:09:13.241 --> 03:09:15.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that together we're gonna stand

03:09:15.577 --> 03:09:16.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and fight for what we believe.

03:09:17.045 --> 03:09:20.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So my name is Philip Florence

03:09:20.882 --> 03:09:21.450 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and I'm a missionary Xin first

03:09:21.516 --> 03:09:22.651 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
year student at the university

03:09:22.718 --> 03:09:24.686 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
of California riverside.

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:27.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And is a psychology major I've

03:09:27.222 --> 03:09:27.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
always wanted to make a

03:09:27.723 --> 03:09:28.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
difference in the world but.

03:09:28.957 --> 03:09:30.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I get there I have to call.

03:09:30.759 --> 03:09:32.794 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:09:32.861 --> 03:09:34.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Financially that makes it very

03:09:35.063 --> 03:09:36.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
difficult.

03:09:36.965 --> 03:09:39.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
If tuition was to go out I'd be

03:09:39.267 --> 03:09:41.403 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
forced to get their job to pay

03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:42.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
off my.

03:09:42.771 --> 03:09:45.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
My parents can help me with

03:09:45.140 --> 03:09:45.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
money because in the end I'm

03:09:45.741 --> 03:09:46.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
actually hoping that.

03:09:46.975 --> 03:09:49.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Then I'm not unemployed because

03:09:49.311 --> 03:09:51.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
they choose to.

03:09:51.179 --> 03:09:53.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
My mother has the duty to take

03:09:53.181 --> 03:09:53.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
care my youngest five year old

03:09:53.782 --> 03:09:55.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
sister.

03:09:55.183 --> 03:09:57.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And my. Father suffers from a

03:09:57.619 --> 03:09:59.187 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
disability and due to racism in

03:09:59.254 --> 03:10:01.356 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
his workplace my father has been

03:10:01.423 --> 03:10:03.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
unjustly rocked of money like

03:10:03.158 --> 03:10:03.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
not being paid overtime.

03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:04.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
When he works it.

03:10:04.993 --> 03:10:07.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And as a little girl I was never

03:10:07.596 --> 03:10:11.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
really able to see my father.

03:10:11.099 --> 03:10:13.135 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And he would always leave it don

03:10:13.201 --> 03:10:15.337 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
early morning and arrived very

03:10:15.403 --> 03:10:17.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
late and when you're little you

03:10:17.506 --> 03:10:19.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
tend to sleep early. And

03:10:19.107 --> 03:10:19.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
sometimes I remember I would

03:10:19.708 --> 03:10:21.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
always way at night image that

03:10:21.443 --> 03:10:23.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
his dad coming home. Centers

03:10:23.178 --> 03:10:25.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
like no he has to stay over

03:10:25.147 --> 03:10:26.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
there at work.

03:10:27.048 --> 03:10:27.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And sometimes I made it even

03:10:27.649 --> 03:10:28.884 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
harder to for me because I

03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:31.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
wouldn't even seem on weekends.

03:10:31.153 --> 03:10:32.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:10:33.054 --> 03:10:33.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
Now.

03:10:33.221 --> 03:10:34.990 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:10:35.056 --> 03:10:36.758 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And he worked excessively

03:10:36.825 --> 03:10:37.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
basically to support the life of

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:38.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
the skits.

03:10:39.060 --> 03:10:40.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And now I'm paying off college

03:10:41.029 --> 03:10:41.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
on my own and trying to support

03:10:41.663 --> 03:10:44.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
my family this.

03:10:44.866 --> 03:10:45.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Raising tuition would force me

03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:47.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to take a job that would take

03:10:47.536 --> 03:10:48.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
away the time I need to study

03:10:48.136 --> 03:10:49.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and do other work.

03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:51.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Such as like internships or

03:10:51.439 --> 03:10:53.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
being here.

03:10:53.074 --> 03:10:55.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I am sure I'm not the only

03:10:55.577 --> 03:10:56.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
student you've heard with the

03:10:56.211 --> 03:10:59.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
story. But I know we all have a

03:10:59.080 --> 03:10:59.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
bunch of potential and all we

03:10:59.714 --> 03:11:00.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
ask is not.

03:11:00.882 --> 03:11:06.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
And hard.

03:11:06.888 --> 03:11:07.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
The.

03:11:07.088 --> 03:11:08.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
People.

03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:11.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Next up we're letting Cooley a

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:14.729 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
fall by Tom who.

03:11:14.796 --> 03:11:16.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Good evening everyone.

03:11:16.798 --> 03:11:19.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

I'm not only I think we've been

03:11:27.209 --> 03:11:27.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
able to have this kind of

03:11:27.742 --> 03:11:29.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
meeting also having students

03:11:29.377 --> 03:11:31.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
come to present. A book during a

03:11:31.179 --> 03:11:35.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
public forum on my name is on

legislative your current.

03:11:42.891 --> 03:11:43.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
The number is an eleven

03:11:43.425 --> 03:11:44.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
including.

03:11:44.926 --> 03:11:47.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Apparently if pursue political

03:11:47.462 --> 03:11:47.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
science major at university

03:11:48.029 --> 03:11:48.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
called for your riverside.

03:11:48.930 --> 03:11:49.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Before I begin I want to ask

03:11:49.564 --> 03:11:50.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
every respective committee

03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:53.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
members to imagine a life where

03:11:53.201 --> 03:11:53.568 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
a college education

03:11:53.635 --> 03:11:54.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
and is.

03:11:54.836 --> 03:11:56.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Deemed as unattainable simply

03:11:57.005 --> 03:11:57.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
due to economic status.

03:11:57.505 --> 03:11:58.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Once which is the reality for

03:11:58.139 --> 03:11:58.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
many students across

03:11:58.907 --> 03:12:01.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
see UC and CSU system arm

03:12:01.443 --> 03:12:02.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
including myself coming from the

03:12:02.143 --> 03:12:05.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
home of immigrants the topic of

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:05.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
on. Immigrants from was who

03:12:05.680 --> 03:12:07.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
other medical.

03:12:07.082 --> 03:12:07.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
The topic of a college

03:12:07.582 --> 03:12:09.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
education would always often of

03:12:09.251 --> 03:12:11.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
one. On to postpone the

03:12:11.486 --> 03:12:12.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
conversation

03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:13.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
about.

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:15.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Affording to pay for one.

03:12:15.323 --> 03:12:17.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It was from a young age that I

03:12:17.325 --> 03:12:18.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
quickly up with knowledge that a

03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:19.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college education was needed for

03:12:19.728 --> 03:12:21.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
social mobility to break the

03:12:21.129 --> 03:12:21.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
cycle financial information.

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:22.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm I'm here today not only to

03:12:22.998 --> 03:12:25.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
represent them the minority once

03:12:25.200 --> 03:12:26.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
on this kind of issue. But

03:12:26.868 --> 03:12:28.703 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
specifically use yours with the

03:12:28.770 --> 03:12:31.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
next on student population who

03:12:31.139 --> 03:12:31.640 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
do not have the privilege of

03:12:31.706 --> 03:12:32.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
presenting a fund

03:12:32.107 --> 03:12:33.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
fine folk here today.

03:12:33.308 --> 03:12:34.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Cho in the little over then

03:12:34.976 --> 03:12:35.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
little over than fifty bombs

03:12:35.577 --> 03:12:37.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
fifty percent of you see our

03:12:37.245 --> 03:12:37.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
students receive the program

03:12:37.812 --> 03:12:40.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
however is still report

03:12:40.982 --> 03:12:41.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
understood large through

03:12:41.483 --> 03:12:42.817 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
external publishes report that

03:12:42.884 --> 03:12:43.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
their food and secure.

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:44.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Specifically because the public

03:12:44.986 --> 03:12:46.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
doesn't cover for things such as

03:12:47.055 --> 03:12:49.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
books etcetera.

03:12:49.157 --> 03:12:49.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:12:49.291 --> 03:12:50.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:12:51.026 --> 03:12:52.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
During my little time at UC

03:12:52.894 --> 03:12:53.495 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
riverside being in government.

03:12:53.561 --> 03:12:55.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Relations assistant director of

03:12:55.397 --> 03:12:57.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
had the opportunity to

03:12:57.098 --> 03:12:58.934 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what externally outside of you

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
see riverside and within the

03:13:01.102 --> 03:13:01.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
seize riverside student

03:13:01.603 --> 03:13:02.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
population I'm having students

03:13:02.237 --> 03:13:03.104 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
come up to me and tell me that.

03:13:03.171 --> 03:13:05.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
On the fact that they have to

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:06.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
skip meals in order to buy books

03:13:07.008 --> 03:13:08.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
on the fact that was a lot of

03:13:08.977 --> 03:13:11.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
students are homeless and didn't

03:13:11.146 --> 03:13:11.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
have anywhere to.

03:13:12.814 --> 03:13:13.415 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
To go during the summer it said

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:15.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
a little little over little weak

03:13:15.383 --> 03:13:16.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
winter breaks.

03:13:16.851 --> 03:13:19.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
With kindest heart mean and it

03:13:19.587 --> 03:13:21.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
makes you run Billy second guess

03:13:21.323 --> 03:13:23.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
what. Where are Senate of

03:13:23.158 --> 03:13:24.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%

03:13:25.026 --> 03:13:25.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
what are the assembly members

03:13:25.627 --> 03:13:26.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
doing to make sure that?

03:13:26.962 --> 03:13:28.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Students are represented and to

03:13:28.797 --> 03:13:29.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have to go to do this kind of

03:13:29.431 --> 03:13:29.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
struggles.

03:13:29.731 --> 03:13:31.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
As a minority voice I call the

03:13:31.499 --> 03:13:32.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
committee not only to focus our

03:13:32.901 --> 03:13:33.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
efforts to create a high.

03:13:33.501 --> 03:13:35.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

03:13:35.270 --> 03:13:36.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
student basic needs one that

03:13:37.038 --> 03:13:37.605 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
provides equity for students of

color think.

03:13:42.811 --> 03:13:44.746 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Even.

03:13:44.813 --> 03:13:47.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Tom moved be followed by Taylor

03:13:47.649 --> 03:13:49.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%

03:13:49.117 --> 03:13:50.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:07.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Let me just many move. Right

03:14:07.402 --> 03:14:08.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
about it.

03:14:09.037 --> 03:14:09.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I just want to quickly touch on

03:14:09.738 --> 03:14:11.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
a couple of things.

03:14:11.139 --> 03:14:12.941 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
This past Tuesday we had ours

03:14:13.008 --> 03:14:14.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
annual student lobby day.

03:14:14.743 --> 03:14:15.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And we were joined by president

03:14:15.410 --> 03:14:17.345 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Jones but he just laughed.

03:14:17.412 --> 03:14:17.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:14:17.545 --> 03:14:19.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We over a hundred twenty cal

03:14:19.381 --> 03:14:19.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
grant students from across the

03:14:20.048 --> 03:14:21.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
state came up to the capitol to

03:14:21.483 --> 03:14:23.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
meet with legislators and or

03:14:23.218 --> 03:14:23.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
staff.

03:14:23.451 --> 03:14:27.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
About the points of.

03:14:27.155 --> 03:14:28.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The cow when work and the

03:14:28.957 --> 03:14:31.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
points of maintaining it at nine

03:14:31.426 --> 03:14:31.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
thousand eighty four.

03:14:31.893 --> 03:14:33.361 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The award has not seen increase

03:14:33.428 --> 03:14:34.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
since two thousand.

03:14:35.063 --> 03:14:37.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And the has actually decreased

03:14:37.198 --> 03:14:37.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
by thirty five percent.

03:14:37.732 --> 03:14:39.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Over the last decade due to

03:14:39.567 --> 03:14:42.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
inflation and also cuts.

03:14:42.771 --> 03:14:45.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
As tickets noted.

03:14:45.373 --> 03:14:47.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
The cal grant is an integral

03:14:47.142 --> 03:14:48.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
part of access and success

03:14:49.044 --> 03:14:51.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
especially for first generation

03:14:51.112 --> 03:14:53.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students and students from

03:14:53.148 --> 03:14:53.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
disadvantaged communities.

03:14:53.715 --> 03:14:54.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
From.

03:14:54.783 --> 03:14:57.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
The cabin students in the

03:14:57.352 --> 03:14:58.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
nonprofit sector a do extremely

03:14:59.020 --> 03:14:59.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
well.

03:14:59.220 --> 03:15:01.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
There they have a sixty two

03:15:01.122 --> 03:15:03.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
percent four year graduation

03:15:03.258 --> 03:15:05.393 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
rate. At in the nonprofit
sector.

03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:07.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I think this exemplifies the

03:15:07.328 --> 03:15:08.997 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
wraparound services that

03:15:09.064 --> 03:15:10.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
president Jones mentioned in

03:15:10.865 --> 03:15:11.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
when he was up here.

03:15:11.299 --> 03:15:13.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:15:13.201 --> 03:15:13.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That are nonprofit college can

03:15:13.802 --> 03:15:16.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
provide to struggling students.

03:15:17.005 --> 03:15:19.174 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
We're grateful that the world

03:15:19.240 --> 03:15:19.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
will not be cut this year.

03:15:19.808 --> 03:15:23.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But we just want to know that

03:15:23.078 --> 03:15:23.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
is stable and hopefully

03:15:23.578 --> 03:15:25.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
increasing.

03:15:25.113 --> 03:15:26.648 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
Cal grant award.

03:15:26.714 --> 03:15:29.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Will help students access and

03:15:29.117 --> 03:15:30.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
succeed.

03:15:31.052 --> 03:15:31.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
In the nonprofit sector of the

03:15:31.719 --> 03:15:32.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
second point very quickly.

03:15:32.854 --> 03:15:36.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A I see see you is working on a.

03:15:37.058 --> 03:15:39.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Variation of the associate

03:15:39.427 --> 03:15:40.995 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
degree for transfer program.

03:15:41.062 --> 03:15:43.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
That would create a strong

03:15:43.231 --> 03:15:45.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
transparent pathway for transfer

03:15:45.266 --> 03:15:45.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
students.

03:15:45.533 --> 03:15:47.168 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
To access.

03:15:47.235 --> 03:15:49.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
More options.

03:15:49.104 --> 03:15:51.039 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
When they look at what they

03:15:51.106 --> 03:15:52.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
want transfer and that we hope

03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:53.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
that you can support that this

03:15:53.641 --> 03:16:03.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
year thank you.

03:16:03.084 --> 03:16:03.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

But high ambition I a good

03:16:39.053 --> 03:16:41.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
evening out on the legislative

03:16:41.823 --> 03:16:42.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

03:16:43.057 --> 03:16:44.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

03:16:45.026 --> 03:16:47.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
government body.

03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:47.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And so I was already thinking

03:16:47.762 --> 03:16:48.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the committee members were here

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:51.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%

One person you hear once again

03:16:59.941 --> 03:17:00.875 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%

03:17:00.942 --> 03:17:03.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Yeah well I don't to drove you

to get here I am here.

03:17:05.413 --> 03:17:07.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And I'm here at this hearing

03:17:07.549 --> 03:17:08.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
because I could afford to me

03:17:08.149 --> 03:17:08.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
right I'm privileged enough to

03:17:08.983 --> 03:17:09.617 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
be here to be able to skip
class.

03:17:09.684 --> 03:17:11.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To not rely on minimum wage

jobs to for my tuition I'm in my

03:17:14.956 --> 03:17:17.091 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
basic needs but. We also to

03:17:17.158 --> 03:17:19.194 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
remember that there were folks

03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:19.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
who couldn't be here today

03:17:19.794 --> 03:17:21.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
we have to remember that so some

03:17:21.329 --> 03:17:23.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
folks were two sometimes three

03:17:23.131 --> 03:17:24.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

part time students.

03:17:25.500 --> 03:17:27.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Here within the you see who

03:17:27.569 --> 03:17:28.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
couldn't be here because they

03:17:28.169 --> 03:17:28.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
can't just work.

What class?

03:17:31.005 --> 03:17:31.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It's important also recognize

what all of us to do therefore

03:17:33.308 --> 03:17:35.577 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

putting.

03:17:36.911 --> 03:17:37.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Within this broken system that

03:17:37.579 --> 03:17:38.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
to stay within it.

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:41.449 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We sure hope that this hearing

03:17:41.516 --> 03:17:42.083 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
several two sticks backing up

03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:43.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
this narrative about you know

03:17:43.184 --> 03:17:43.785 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
lack of resources lack of basic

03:17:43.851 --> 03:17:44.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
needs and those statistics

03:17:44.986 --> 03:17:47.021 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
represent us but. They're also

03:17:47.088 --> 03:17:47.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
you know representative real

03:17:47.689 --> 03:17:48.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
students real stories and a

03:17:48.256 --> 03:17:48.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
total lack of access to

03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:50.925 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
affordable housing and food. So

03:17:50.992 --> 03:17:53.294 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
just budget is six rate you see

03:17:53.361 --> 03:17:53.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
things home to the fort worth

03:17:53.995 --> 03:17:55.196 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
small city in the.

03:17:55.263 --> 03:17:57.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
U. S. were renters we do not

03:17:57.198 --> 03:17:58.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
have a designated.

Site for.

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:01.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Housing are libertarian Regis

03:18:01.402 --> 03:18:03.238 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
defenders of not spent but

03:18:03.304 --> 03:18:05.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
tuitions as well as I'm just of

03:18:05.206 --> 03:18:05.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
actions are moon plans are

03:18:05.773 --> 03:18:07.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
expensive our food pantries

03:18:07.408 --> 03:18:08.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
under are underfunded.

03:18:08.843 --> 03:18:09.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
So what do all of us what we

03:18:09.444 --> 03:18:11.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
want greater state investment.

03:18:11.346 --> 03:18:11.813 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
In all areas of public

03:18:11.879 --> 03:18:13.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
education and this committee

03:18:13.114 --> 03:18:13.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
albeit you know a small step is

03:18:13.748 --> 03:18:14.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
a step in the right direction.

03:18:14.382 --> 03:18:15.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But it will only mean something

03:18:15.617 --> 03:18:17.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
if it's efforts are continuous

03:18:17.218 --> 03:18:19.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
and center student voices and I

03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:21.022 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
can't emphasize that enough so

03:18:21.089 --> 03:18:22.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I'm to all of you to carefully

03:18:23.024 --> 03:18:23.591 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
listen to the student stories.

03:18:23.658 --> 03:18:25.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Take them to heart understand

03:18:25.193 --> 03:18:27.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that there is a lot of emotional

03:18:27.328 --> 03:18:28.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and physical labor put into

03:18:28.997 --> 03:18:31.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
coming here. And to work to

03:18:31.266 --> 03:18:33.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

You guys for coming.

03:19:01.095 --> 03:19:04.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
I think it'll be here

03:19:04.799 --> 03:19:05.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
got us out of.

03:19:05.166 --> 03:19:06.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Enhance higher education.

03:19:07.035 --> 03:19:08.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
As a collective.

03:19:08.836 --> 03:19:11.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
From by scantily I'm a first

03:19:11.606 --> 03:19:12.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
year student. I see senators

03:19:12.807 --> 03:19:13.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I'm a part of the student union

03:19:13.441 --> 03:19:15.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
the.

03:19:15.143 --> 03:19:18.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DR student I UC Santa Cruz.

03:19:18.846 --> 03:19:20.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
I'm as big has said.

03:19:21.049 --> 03:19:21.549 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
We're all provision of to be

03:19:21.616 --> 03:19:22.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
here.

03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:23.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And so afford to miss a day of

03:19:23.518 --> 03:19:26.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
school. And not have to worry.

03:19:26.854 --> 03:19:28.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
To pay tuition.

03:19:28.956 --> 03:19:31.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I mean that's can attain for me

03:19:31.426 --> 03:19:31.826 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
it will soon hereby.

03:19:31.893 --> 03:19:32.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

03:19:32.093 --> 03:19:33.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:19:33.161 --> 03:19:36.798 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Was brought up earlier was that.

03:19:36.864 --> 03:19:37.465 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
The state Senate more students I

03:19:37.532 --> 03:19:38.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
understand this.

03:19:38.866 --> 03:19:41.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Transfer students

03:19:41.135 --> 03:19:41.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
are not transferring.

03:19:41.602 --> 03:19:43.004 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
To.

03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:45.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Bob for universities.

03:19:45.073 --> 03:19:46.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
Because.

03:19:46.874 --> 03:19:49.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
It's there is not space.

03:19:49.177 --> 03:19:51.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
But.

03:19:51.179 --> 03:19:53.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
A problem.

03:19:53.181 --> 03:19:56.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
You see senators I capacity.

03:19:56.984 --> 03:19:58.920 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Like in every way shape and
form.

03:19:58.986 --> 03:20:00.822 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Buses are.

03:20:00.888 --> 03:20:01.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Till date leave the station but

03:20:01.522 --> 03:20:03.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
our.

03:20:03.091 --> 03:20:05.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Without admitting every student

03:20:05.460 --> 03:20:07.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
who was waiting at the bus stop

03:20:07.495 --> 03:20:08.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
suits have to wait longer.

03:20:08.796 --> 03:20:10.998 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Classes are completely full

03:20:11.065 --> 03:20:12.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
since who needs to take

03:20:12.967 --> 03:20:13.568 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
directors instead declare
majors.

03:20:13.634 --> 03:20:16.804 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Cannot do that and as a result

03:20:16.871 --> 03:20:17.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
or staying for longer than four

03:20:17.505 --> 03:20:19.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
years at the institute.

03:20:19.107 --> 03:20:20.942 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:20:21.008 --> 03:20:24.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Yes and the solution to this. Is

03:20:24.979 --> 03:20:25.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
the bottom. Simply find the

03:20:25.546 --> 03:20:26.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
university system.

03:20:26.814 --> 03:20:29.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
The way it should be.

03:20:29.117 --> 03:20:31.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:20:31.119 --> 03:20:33.054 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
I was brought up earlier as
well.

03:20:33.121 --> 03:20:34.956 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Was an emphasis on mental
health.

03:20:35.022 --> 03:20:37.158 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
UC Santa Cruz has.

03:20:37.225 --> 03:20:38.960 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
And is tuition called.

03:20:39.026 --> 03:20:40.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Caps which is the.

03:20:41.028 --> 03:20:41.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Counseling and psychological

03:20:41.596 --> 03:20:42.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
services.

03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:46.768 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Department at our school.

03:20:46.834 --> 03:20:47.435 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
We of are currently staffed at a

03:20:47.502 --> 03:20:47.969 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
ratio of one to seventeen

03:20:48.035 --> 03:20:49.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
hundred.

03:20:49.337 --> 03:20:51.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Students to faculty ratio there.

03:20:51.139 --> 03:20:54.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
And after four sessions.

03:20:54.842 --> 03:20:55.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
At that institution you're

03:20:55.410 --> 03:20:57.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
referred off campus.

03:20:57.145 --> 03:20:59.380 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Assuming you can even afford to

03:20:59.447 --> 03:21:00.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
go there insurance covers.

03:21:01.048 --> 03:21:04.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
So. Also. That's funded by

03:21:04.986 --> 03:21:06.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
student fees and not by.

03:21:06.988 --> 03:21:07.555 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Anything else systems are paying

03:21:07.622 --> 03:21:08.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
for this.

03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:10.825 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I think I want to bring out.

03:21:10.892 --> 03:21:12.927 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Was very pantries.

03:21:12.994 --> 03:21:15.129 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We have one fifty insurance our

03:21:15.196 --> 03:21:15.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
campus serving.

03:21:15.563 --> 03:21:17.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
All of seventy thousand students

03:21:17.665 --> 03:21:19.233 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
undergraduate. And graduate

03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:21.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
students as well.

03:21:21.102 --> 03:21:24.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Battling his by the sunset was

03:21:25.039 --> 03:21:26.841 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
established Patterson
government.

03:21:26.908 --> 03:21:27.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
The future is uncertain because

03:21:27.542 --> 03:21:29.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
it is

03:21:29.076 --> 03:21:30.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
the space is help them.

03:21:31.012 --> 03:21:31.512 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Isn't helpers which is our

03:21:31.579 --> 03:21:32.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
office for.

03:21:33.014 --> 03:21:33.448 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
That's for education and

03:21:33.514 --> 03:21:36.951 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
recreation sports.

03:21:37.018 --> 03:21:37.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So the gem and sports and all

03:21:37.618 --> 03:21:39.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
that sort of way.

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:39.620 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
And it's not the spaces and

03:21:39.687 --> 03:21:42.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
designated.

03:21:42.924 --> 03:21:43.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That was established by the

03:21:43.491 --> 03:21:45.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
student.

03:21:45.126 --> 03:21:47.061 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Not by any sort of.

03:21:47.128 --> 03:21:49.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Tuition or administrative body.

03:21:49.330 --> 03:21:50.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:21:50.932 --> 03:21:54.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
Currently public.

Sam go are not on nobody has the

03:21:57.171 --> 03:21:59.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
right spoke about this. Is

03:21:59.173 --> 03:22:00.775 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%

Their places and.

03:22:04.946 --> 03:22:06.848 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
And I just think it's astounding

03:22:06.914 --> 03:22:07.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that students have to take upon

03:22:07.548 --> 03:22:07.782 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
themselves.

03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:08.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
To.

03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:11.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Perform services that should.

03:22:11.152 --> 03:22:12.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

Under their.

03:22:13.187 --> 03:22:16.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Should be their problem.

03:22:17.058 --> 03:22:17.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
This question we paid tuition

03:22:17.692 --> 03:22:18.893 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
that is so expensive.

03:22:18.960 --> 03:22:20.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
And were.

03:22:20.962 --> 03:22:21.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Right with it being a raise this

03:22:21.596 --> 03:22:22.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

I am out clear and in the third

03:22:53.427 --> 03:22:53.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
year you see.

03:22:53.761 --> 03:22:55.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So the last couple of years. And

03:22:55.329 --> 03:22:58.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I've been helping my sister and

03:22:58.866 --> 03:22:59.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
my cousin.

03:22:59.166 --> 03:22:59.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Piper college.

03:22:59.534 --> 03:23:01.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And it's been a really special

03:23:01.536 --> 03:23:03.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
time because.

03:23:03.137 --> 03:23:04.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Were all family the migraines

03:23:04.972 --> 03:23:05.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
and.

03:23:05.172 --> 03:23:07.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Were all were going to be the

03:23:07.375 --> 03:23:09.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
first generation in our family

03:23:09.176 --> 03:23:10.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
to go and.

03:23:11.012 --> 03:23:11.612 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And everyone took said in the

03:23:11.679 --> 03:23:12.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ruins of proud but at the same

03:23:12.346 --> 03:23:15.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
time there's just so much wary

03:23:15.082 --> 03:23:15.583 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
involved. I'm in applying

03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:19.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
because over the last couple

03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:19.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
years in this process and going

03:23:19.787 --> 03:23:21.122 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to college myself it's become so

03:23:21.188 --> 03:23:25.059 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
clear that. And access to higher

03:23:25.126 --> 03:23:26.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
education access the pap that if

you do your dreams and.

03:23:28.930 --> 03:23:33.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Is like so hard and and it's not

03:23:33.134 --> 03:23:33.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
just getting into your dream

03:23:35.169 --> 03:23:37.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
My cousins on huntsman sister

03:23:37.204 --> 03:23:38.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
that link.

03:23:38.973 --> 03:23:39.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Getting there and and

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
maintaining access to that the

03:23:41.409 --> 03:23:43.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
school your dream sometimes

03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:44.779 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
require skipping sometimes

03:23:44.845 --> 03:23:47.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
requires working with will just

03:23:47.415 --> 03:23:47.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
suddenly fires.

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:49.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Like not being able to study in

03:23:49.584 --> 03:23:50.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
failing a test and having to

03:23:50.184 --> 03:23:52.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
deal with that so.

03:23:52.987 --> 03:23:53.554 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
We need to do better all of us

03:23:53.621 --> 03:23:57.124 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
need to do better and.

03:23:57.191 --> 03:23:58.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
There are so many kids out there

03:23:59.060 --> 03:24:00.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
with so much ambition with.

03:24:00.895 --> 03:24:03.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
That are so smart and so bright

03:24:03.331 --> 03:24:05.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
who do not get the opportunity

03:24:05.166 --> 03:24:07.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and who feel like. They can't

03:24:07.268 --> 03:24:09.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
and and it's just it's a shame

03:24:09.503 --> 03:24:10.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
and needs to better.

03:24:11.005 --> 03:24:13.240 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

opportunity to talk about.

03:24:36.831 --> 03:24:39.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Some of the green issues I of

03:24:39.100 --> 03:24:40.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
witnessing experience at my

03:24:41.002 --> 03:24:42.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

very excited phone very on.

03:24:55.616 --> 03:24:57.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Grateful to witness some of the

03:24:57.551 --> 03:24:59.020 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
opportunities to be given to me

03:24:59.086 --> 03:25:00.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
summaries his I could

03:25:00.821 --> 03:25:01.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
potentially like take advantage

03:25:01.455 --> 03:25:02.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
off.

03:25:02.857 --> 03:25:04.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
But I wanted to talk and stress

03:25:04.959 --> 03:25:06.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
about like some of the issues

03:25:06.927 --> 03:25:07.428 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
regarding the relationship

03:25:07.495 --> 03:25:09.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
between housing and over

03:25:09.330 --> 03:25:11.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
enrollment. At my university.

03:25:11.165 --> 03:25:11.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:25:11.365 --> 03:25:13.134 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
Throughout the year I've

03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:15.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
witnessed the school crammed

03:25:15.269 --> 03:25:17.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
thousands of students in to

03:25:17.104 --> 03:25:17.672 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
various housing units but just

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:19.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
don't have the capacity or the

03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:20.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
utilities.

03:25:20.975 --> 03:25:21.475 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To fit a like most of these

03:25:21.542 --> 03:25:22.810 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
people.

03:25:22.877 --> 03:25:23.010 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:25:23.077 --> 03:25:25.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Mayor Dorn such as mine are

03:25:25.546 --> 03:25:28.816 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
often very crowded and it's
very.

03:25:28.883 --> 03:25:29.517 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Not it does not not suitable for

03:25:29.583 --> 03:25:30.818 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
living conditions.

03:25:30.885 --> 03:25:32.720 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:25:32.787 --> 03:25:35.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
For me this transformation was

03:25:35.356 --> 03:25:36.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
very comfortable to handle.

03:25:36.924 --> 03:25:38.926 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Some of the utilities in my

03:25:38.993 --> 03:25:39.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
dorm are often exhausted to the

03:25:39.627 --> 03:25:41.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
point of having electrical

03:25:41.162 --> 03:25:45.032 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
blackouts. Clogged toilets sinks

03:25:45.099 --> 03:25:45.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
and.

03:25:45.299 --> 03:25:47.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Shower drains as well as.

03:25:47.134 --> 03:25:49.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Various colleges like broken

03:25:49.170 --> 03:25:50.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
doors.

03:25:50.838 --> 03:25:52.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
Broken window sometimes

03:25:52.807 --> 03:25:53.307 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
broken washing machines and

03:25:53.374 --> 03:25:55.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
dryers.

03:25:55.142 --> 03:25:56.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:25:57.044 --> 03:25:59.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
You know living in a small room

03:25:59.113 --> 03:26:01.082 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
with two other roommates who

03:26:01.148 --> 03:26:01.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
have various stuff.

03:26:01.582 --> 03:26:05.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We can often prove very up

03:26:05.086 --> 03:26:06.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
claustrophobic to me sometimes

03:26:06.921 --> 03:26:09.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
as well as being very affected

03:26:09.123 --> 03:26:10.958 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
to my allergies I often. As a

03:26:11.025 --> 03:26:11.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
person with a history of asthma

03:26:11.659 --> 03:26:14.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Idaho often proves like very.

03:26:14.962 --> 03:26:16.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Stressful to. Be comfortable and

03:26:16.997 --> 03:26:19.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
then like very stressful to.

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:21.102 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
To sleep as well so I often

03:26:21.168 --> 03:26:22.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
found myself witnessing that

03:26:22.837 --> 03:26:23.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I've been prone to be more sick

03:26:23.504 --> 03:26:25.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
often I've.

03:26:25.072 --> 03:26:28.809 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Often god are groups like.

03:26:28.876 --> 03:26:30.678 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Sore throats nam very runny

03:26:30.745 --> 03:26:33.013 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
noses and I often found myself

03:26:33.080 --> 03:26:33.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
going to the health center like.

03:26:33.748 --> 03:26:34.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Every month or so.

03:26:34.882 --> 03:26:37.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:26:37.084 --> 03:26:38.719 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
It may seem simple to just say.

03:26:38.786 --> 03:26:40.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Make a simple request maybe

03:26:40.955 --> 03:26:43.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
find yourself a single room bite

03:26:43.257 --> 03:26:43.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
on the weightless is

03:26:43.724 --> 03:26:45.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
astoundingly long because of how

03:26:45.226 --> 03:26:46.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
many students are enrolled at

03:26:47.027 --> 03:26:48.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
UCSC.

03:26:48.896 --> 03:26:51.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That the most likely response

03:26:51.232 --> 03:26:51.799 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
and I would receive would be.

03:26:51.866 --> 03:26:54.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Next year in the fall of two

03:26:55.002 --> 03:26:55.369 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
thousand eighteen.

03:26:55.436 --> 03:26:57.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:26:57.104 --> 03:26:58.973 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Because of this I also have to

03:26:59.039 --> 03:27:01.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
juggle the stresses of studying

03:27:01.408 --> 03:27:01.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for my finals on winter quarter

03:27:02.042 --> 03:27:05.012 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and also. Knowing where am I

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:05.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
going to live next year one my

03:27:05.746 --> 03:27:07.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
going to live with and how we

03:27:07.181 --> 03:27:07.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
gonna figure out the costs and

03:27:07.815 --> 03:27:08.849 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
stuff like that.

03:27:08.916 --> 03:27:09.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
So.

03:27:09.083 --> 03:27:11.552 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I just wanted to ask you all

03:27:11.619 --> 03:27:13.487 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
like to St questions to consider

03:27:13.554 --> 03:27:14.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
power as you go on today.

03:27:15.022 --> 03:27:15.156 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
And.

03:27:15.222 --> 03:27:18.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
Number one was.

03:27:18.926 --> 03:27:19.527 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Since it has been reported that

03:27:19.593 --> 03:27:21.128 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
the state of California's

03:27:21.195 --> 03:27:22.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
project began a sixty seven

03:27:22.997 --> 03:27:25.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
million dollars billion dollars

03:27:25.199 --> 03:27:25.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
not million dollar surplus.

03:27:25.766 --> 03:27:27.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
Look good proportion of the

03:27:27.434 --> 03:27:27.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
garden that had very of

03:27:27.935 --> 03:27:29.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
situations that. California

03:27:29.203 --> 03:27:31.071 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
public institutions are

03:27:31.138 --> 03:27:32.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
currently facing.

03:27:32.873 --> 03:27:35.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And number two is what is

03:27:35.309 --> 03:27:35.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
currently the best planned to

03:27:35.943 --> 03:27:37.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
have to conduct some of these

03:27:37.478 --> 03:27:38.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
issues.

03:27:38.979 --> 03:27:40.981 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And with number three on with

03:27:41.048 --> 03:27:42.917 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
all of us residing in the state.

03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:43.551 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
That holds some of the world's

03:27:43.617 --> 03:27:46.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
greatest learning institutions.

03:27:46.887 --> 03:27:47.421 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Dear how these great colleges

03:27:47.488 --> 03:27:48.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
are slowly deteriorating.

03:27:48.989 --> 03:27:49.557 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Israel arming and disheartening

03:27:49.623 --> 03:27:53.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
for me.

03:27:53.194 --> 03:27:53.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Myself and thousands of other

03:27:53.794 --> 03:27:55.329 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students in the UC system.

03:27:55.396 --> 03:27:57.298 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Calyces system and California

to survive and grow.

03:28:05.005 --> 03:28:05.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
Then how do expect our

03:28:05.506 --> 03:28:06.774 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
generation those support the

03:28:06.841 --> 03:28:07.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
next generation of college

03:28:55.089 --> 03:28:55.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
attracted to the you see I was

03:28:55.723 --> 03:28:57.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
also. I'm acting as a parent for

03:28:57.491 --> 03:28:58.659 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
my

03:28:58.726 --> 03:28:59.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
stirs up because my parents were

03:28:59.426 --> 03:29:01.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
busy right they had to work in

03:29:01.395 --> 03:29:02.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
order for me to go to college.

03:29:02.863 --> 03:29:05.232 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

03:29:09.270 --> 03:29:09.436 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
system.

03:29:09.503 --> 03:29:11.105 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
And then I come home over

winter break in my parents but

03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:13.607 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the news that I to resettle the

03:29:13.674 --> 03:29:15.242 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
can go back to this semester. I

03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:18.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UC Merced rate for years I spent

03:29:19.013 --> 03:29:21.315 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
juggling a. Training I like that

03:29:21.382 --> 03:29:23.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
for years I spent drug juggling

03:29:23.350 --> 03:29:27.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
student governments to delay my

03:29:27.187 --> 03:29:27.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
AB because

03:29:27.454 --> 03:29:29.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
even with my

03:29:29.089 --> 03:29:29.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
stirs right making sure that

03:29:29.723 --> 03:29:30.257 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
they go to school making sure

03:29:30.324 --> 03:29:31.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that they were. Clean making

03:29:31.625 --> 03:29:32.259 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
sure they eight making sure they

03:29:32.326 --> 03:29:34.828 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
were fed like I was practically

03:29:34.895 --> 03:29:36.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
is up appearance my sisters

03:29:36.797 --> 03:29:38.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
right at the age of fourteen I

03:29:39.033 --> 03:29:39.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
was taking care of three peat.

03:29:39.667 --> 03:29:39.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
Right.

03:29:39.900 --> 03:29:43.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
And for all of that hard work

03:29:43.270 --> 03:29:43.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
to go down to the guard

03:29:43.771 --> 03:29:45.005 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
because my parents couldn't

03:29:45.072 --> 03:29:45.239 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
afford.

03:29:45.306 --> 03:29:46.674 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:48.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Could not afford it for me to

03:29:48.809 --> 03:29:49.310 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
stay at UC Merced rate.

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:51.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So I hope that you are taking

03:29:51.612 --> 03:29:53.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
my narrative.

03:29:53.147 --> 03:29:54.915 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Into consideration right you

03:29:54.982 --> 03:29:55.249 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
have people.

03:29:55.316 --> 03:29:57.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
To spend so much time and

03:29:57.551 --> 03:30:01.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
energy just to get here right

03:30:01.121 --> 03:30:02.856 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and now that we got here we

03:30:02.923 --> 03:30:03.424 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
don't have the resources to

03:30:03.490 --> 03:30:03.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
sustain us.

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:05.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Great I'm I don't think it

03:30:05.292 --> 03:30:07.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
should be this difficult right I

03:30:07.728 --> 03:30:09.463 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
don't have reek I don't know the

03:30:09.530 --> 03:30:11.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
resources offered to member side

03:30:11.465 --> 03:30:13.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
because I'm an immigrant rate.

03:30:13.267 --> 03:30:15.202 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Idea how parents I could talk to

03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:15.769 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
it and how my grandparents I

03:30:15.836 --> 03:30:16.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
could

03:30:16.737 --> 03:30:17.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
two I was the first one in my

03:30:17.338 --> 03:30:18.872 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
heart and my family to attend a

03:30:18.939 --> 03:30:19.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
forty university.

03:30:19.340 --> 03:30:21.308 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
So I don't have aye the

03:30:21.375 --> 03:30:23.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
opportunity or resources or

03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
whatever that my school provided

03:30:23.744 --> 03:30:25.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
I didn't know about that

03:30:25.145 --> 03:30:27.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I rate aye again democratic. I

03:30:27.414 --> 03:30:29.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
came here when I was three like.

03:30:29.183 --> 03:30:30.851 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
But we do nothing we just knew

03:30:30.918 --> 03:30:31.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
each other that's that's what I

03:30:31.552 --> 03:30:32.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
had my family

03:30:32.853 --> 03:30:35.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
right into going to college

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:36.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
right not having my family not

03:30:36.857 --> 03:30:38.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
having my support system. Right

03:30:38.759 --> 03:30:40.694 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
but also are having to

03:30:40.761 --> 03:30:41.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
like having the two three wait

03:30:41.395 --> 03:30:41.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
two three week wait to go to

03:30:41.962 --> 03:30:42.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
catch.

03:30:42.796 --> 03:30:44.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
That's absurd great so making

03:30:45.065 --> 03:30:45.566 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
sure that your also putting

03:30:45.632 --> 03:30:47.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
money into

03:30:47.167 --> 03:30:49.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
I hope resources.

03:30:49.103 --> 03:30:50.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
Because Merced has

03:30:50.771 --> 03:30:53.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
highest percentage of appeal see

03:30:53.273 --> 03:30:53.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
students write low income

03:30:53.807 --> 03:30:55.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
students but no way to support

03:30:55.376 --> 03:30:56.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
them great we don't have.

03:30:56.810 --> 03:30:59.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Our campus ray our food pantry

03:30:59.113 --> 03:31:01.048 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%

03:31:05.185 --> 03:31:07.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are putting money into higher

03:31:07.154 --> 03:31:08.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
education to suspend your

03:31:08.989 --> 03:31:11.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
students right because. We

they also juggling art class.

03:31:15.029 --> 03:31:21.335 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
To make sure we're now if you

While at the same time

balancing my education.

03:33:05.072 --> 03:33:07.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
When I began high school.

03:33:07.074 --> 03:33:07.574 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
A people around me were

03:33:07.641 --> 03:33:08.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
thinking and talking about going

03:33:09.042 --> 03:33:11.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
to college you're thinking about

03:33:11.311 --> 03:33:11.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
possibilities and they're

03:33:11.845 --> 03:33:13.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
gaining themselves.

03:33:13.280 --> 03:33:14.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Those necessity opportunities

03:33:14.848 --> 03:33:15.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
to get their.

03:33:15.182 --> 03:33:18.852 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
So now I continue to push

03:33:18.919 --> 03:33:19.419 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
myself and I could to push

03:33:19.486 --> 03:33:21.121 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
myself to get there but the same

03:33:21.188 --> 03:33:23.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
time balancing the work.

03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:23.590 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
In being involved in the

03:33:23.657 --> 03:33:25.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
community that was part of being

03:33:25.125 --> 03:33:27.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
a are a mentor to a lot of

03:33:27.394 --> 03:33:31.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
people that were around me who

03:33:31.331 --> 03:33:31.865 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
are like myself and document.

03:33:31.932 --> 03:33:32.499 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
So I saw myself applying to

03:33:32.566 --> 03:33:33.500 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
college apply to see if you seen

03:33:33.567 --> 03:33:35.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%

03:33:35.369 --> 03:33:37.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I never I didn't meet their

03:33:37.271 --> 03:33:39.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

the to buy decided appeal my

03:33:41.775 --> 03:33:42.776 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
with of the system.

03:33:42.843 --> 03:33:44.912 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Wimp that's where I ended up

03:33:44.978 --> 03:33:46.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are you see Merced now you see

03:33:47.014 --> 03:33:47.614 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Merced considers it opens panics

03:33:47.681 --> 03:33:49.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
or institution with.

03:33:49.116 --> 03:33:51.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

accustomed to debt. Is a trickle

03:37:39.079 --> 03:37:39.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
down effect more of a rhetorical

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:41.081 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
question.

03:37:41.148 --> 03:37:43.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

03:39:39.199 --> 03:39:40.834 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
time the food there is spoiled.

03:39:40.901 --> 03:39:44.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
So we kinda have to get the food

03:39:44.771 --> 03:39:47.040 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
and hope that it it still
edible.

03:39:47.107 --> 03:39:49.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Are in addition I work right now

03:39:49.142 --> 03:39:49.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
we are facing.

03:39:49.509 --> 03:39:51.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Apostolate tuition increase for

03:39:51.444 --> 03:39:53.313 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the second year in a row. On we

03:39:53.380 --> 03:39:55.148 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
are actually planning on going

03:39:55.215 --> 03:39:57.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
over to Sacramento and asking

03:39:57.284 --> 03:39:59.286 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
governor brown for one funding

03:39:59.352 --> 03:40:00.854 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
for its use you.

03:40:00.921 --> 03:40:01.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
Because on something that we

03:40:01.521 --> 03:40:04.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
notices that as on.

03:40:04.925 --> 03:40:07.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
As the morning students of color

03:40:07.294 --> 03:40:07.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
had entered to see if you use

03:40:07.894 --> 03:40:10.830 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
the lighter on this the funding

03:40:10.897 --> 03:40:11.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
for his issues has become

03:40:11.431 --> 03:40:13.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
lighter. And we feel that that

03:40:13.233 --> 03:40:17.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
is not right we want us we want

03:40:17.103 --> 03:40:17.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
something someone up full of

03:40:17.704 --> 03:40:21.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
money. For this is to use so

03:40:21.174 --> 03:40:23.043 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that our own federal would have

03:40:23.109 --> 03:40:25.045 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
to show it this every year.

03:40:25.111 --> 03:40:27.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
Because on.

03:40:27.147 --> 03:40:31.051 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We actually had a could I. Cook

03:40:31.117 --> 03:40:34.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
convinced nam poorer part of.

03:40:35.055 --> 03:40:35.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We're gonna at issue is of

03:40:35.655 --> 03:40:37.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
worker sees member here at and

03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:39.426 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Fresno. On we committed to

03:40:39.492 --> 03:40:41.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
putting gas increase but it took

03:40:41.394 --> 03:40:42.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
awhile because.

03:40:42.996 --> 03:40:45.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Did he see he thought that that

03:40:45.398 --> 03:40:45.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
was the only way that it on see

03:40:46.066 --> 03:40:47.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
if you can be funded. But this

03:40:47.434 --> 03:40:49.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
this year they decided to on

03:40:49.603 --> 03:40:50.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
allows.

03:40:51.004 --> 03:40:54.874 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
To proposes budget before the

03:40:54.941 --> 03:40:55.542 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
decision felt that is why we are

03:40:55.609 --> 03:40:57.377 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
going to Sacramento and we're

03:40:57.444 --> 03:40:57.844 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
hoping to take as many

that were made.

03:41:58.972 --> 03:41:59.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
And I members hearing a lot of

03:41:59.572 --> 03:41:59.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
these

03:41:59.773 --> 03:42:00.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
when I was.

03:42:00.907 --> 03:42:02.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%

How are how many of the problems

03:42:09.049 --> 03:42:09.649 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
that we talked about and having

03:42:09.716 --> 03:42:11.384 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
yet been solved effect in some

03:42:11.451 --> 03:42:12.819 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
respects it gotten worse?

03:42:12.886 --> 03:42:15.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
With with the situation and in

03:42:15.288 --> 03:42:16.890 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
Washington

am.

03:42:24.998 --> 03:42:26.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
We're gonna work hard to try to

03:42:26.866 --> 03:42:28.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
turn around so that extra money

03:42:28.868 --> 03:42:29.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
it's in the budget to help

03:42:29.402 --> 03:42:29.836 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
address. Some of these

03:42:29.903 --> 03:42:31.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
affordability questions.

03:42:31.104 --> 03:42:33.306 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

it's area your stories I think

03:42:37.577 --> 03:42:38.878 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
are very moving and very
telling.

03:42:38.945 --> 03:42:41.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
I need to bring him to more

03:42:41.347 --> 03:42:43.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
elected officials need to bring

03:42:43.116 --> 03:42:43.683 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
into the governor you can bring

03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:43.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
into the.

03:42:44.017 --> 03:42:45.418 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
Members of Congress represent

03:42:45.485 --> 03:42:47.053 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Central Valley members the

03:42:47.120 --> 03:42:47.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
legislature's well.

03:42:47.587 --> 03:42:51.057 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
So they will take those those

03:42:51.124 --> 03:42:51.658 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
voices with them when they're

03:42:51.725 --> 03:42:51.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
making

03:42:51.925 --> 03:42:52.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
visions in.

03:42:52.859 --> 03:42:54.761 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
And Washington in Sacramento

03:42:54.828 --> 03:42:55.328 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
site I really do appreciate

03:42:55.395 --> 03:42:56.796 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
everybody's call.

03:42:56.863 --> 03:43:00.800 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
Thank you the center.

03:43:00.867 --> 03:43:03.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
It'd make an opening statement

03:43:03.303 --> 03:43:05.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
so I. Feel good about making a

03:43:05.472 --> 03:43:06.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
closing statement.

03:43:06.873 --> 03:43:07.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But to the student from Santa

03:43:07.474 --> 03:43:08.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Barbara. That.

03:43:08.975 --> 03:43:11.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Don't first let me thank.

03:43:11.111 --> 03:43:13.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
Everyone including.

03:43:15.048 --> 03:43:17.016 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
Fresno community college.

03:43:17.083 --> 03:43:20.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And I chair for having is here.

03:43:20.987 --> 03:43:21.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
But I think what you're doing

03:43:21.588 --> 03:43:23.123 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
and what you're saying here

03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:24.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
today is exactly what. I senator

03:43:25.058 --> 03:43:27.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
Allen said. Needs to continue to

03:43:27.227 --> 03:43:28.928 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
happen.

03:43:28.995 --> 03:43:31.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
It is too often in Sacramento

03:43:31.197 --> 03:43:33.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
that we look at numbers. And not

03:43:33.533 --> 03:43:34.901 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
individuals

03:43:34.968 --> 03:43:36.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
so if the students will continue

03:43:37.036 --> 03:43:38.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
to do what they've done here

03:43:38.972 --> 03:43:40.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
today. But they did in

03:43:40.874 --> 03:43:43.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Sacramento a couple weeks ago.

03:43:43.209 --> 03:43:45.145 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
And bring more students with
you.

03:43:45.211 --> 03:43:47.080 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
And bring more stories with you

03:43:47.147 --> 03:43:48.948 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
so that the legislature and the

03:43:49.015 --> 03:43:51.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
governor here's the effect. Of

03:43:51.251 --> 03:43:52.919 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
what we're doing in Sacramento

03:43:52.986 --> 03:43:56.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
on your individual lives I think

03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:59.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
we'll do better so thank you.

03:43:59.125 --> 03:44:00.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
Especially the students from UC

03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:03.062 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
riverside everything is
imminent.

03:44:03.129 --> 03:44:03.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
That Arambula we don't have

03:44:03.696 --> 03:44:05.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
anything.
