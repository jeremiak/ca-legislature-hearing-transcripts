THE BILL TO SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR PAN AND ACT GOING TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THE FLOOR IS YOURS DOCTOR PAN. THANKS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB TWO LANES TO SEVENTY SIX A BILL SPONSORED BY DOCTORS AND FAMILIES. WHICH PREVENTS UNETHICAL PHYSICIANS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ANXIOUSNESS INFORM PARENTS BY SELLING INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND DANGER CHILDREN AT SCHOOL. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX BUT SURE STUDENTS WHO TRULY NEEDED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THAT WILL RECEIVE THEM AND THAT THE SCHOOL TODAY AT TEN MAINTAIN TO MEDIUM UNITY TO KEEP THEM SAFE. FOUR YEARS AGO IN THE FACE OF THE MEASLES OUTBREAK RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE INFECTED OVER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE MOST TO OUR UNVACCINATED. THE LEGISLATURE THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK ACTION BY PASSING SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN TO BE SAFE IN SCHOOL FROM PREVENTABLE INFECTIONS. SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WORKED. AS OUR COUNTRY IS TODAY'S EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MEASLES AND FACTIONS AND OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY CASES TODAY. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT HAD A LARGE OUTBREAK LIKE THE ONE WE HAD BACK TO DISNEYLAND NOT LIKE THE ONES ARE EXPERIENCING NOW NEW YORK MICHIGAN AND WASHINGTON. DESPITE THE FACT OF HAD SEVERAL CASES OF MEASLES BROUGHT INTO OUR STATE BY TRAVELERS. HOWEVER ARE HARD FOUGHT EFFORT TO RESTORE COMMUNITY IS BEING ATTACKED. BY CANCER. BY HANDFUL UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS FOR SELLING INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR THEIR OWN PROFIT. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN THEY BEGAN ADVERTISING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ONLINE AND OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. SOMEWHAT OFFER EXEMPTIONS FOR CASH WITHOUT EVER EVEN EXAMINING THE CHILD. IN FACT SINCE THAT TIME CALIFORNIA'S READY EXPERIENCE AN OUTBREAK WHERE IN UNVACCINATED CHILD. WITH SUSPECT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ACTUALLY BECAME INFECTED WITH MEASLES AND THEN SPREAD THIS DISEASE TO OTHER CHILDREN. THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. REPORTED ON SCHOOLS WITH MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. RATES AS HIGH AS 50%. AND MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED SCHOOLS LAST YEAR REPORTED MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES ABOVE WHEN THESE EXEMPTIONS SHOULD BE UNDER 2%? THESE SCHOOLS ARE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK FOR THE STUDENTS TEACHERS AND STAFF AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. UNDER SB TWO SEVENTY SIX STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WILL NEED THE FILE THOSE XEMPTIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE EXEMPTION TO REMAIN VALID. HOWEVER THOSE EXEMPTIONS WILL BE GRANDFATHERED UNLESS THE STATE OR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER SPECIFICALLY INVALIDATES THAT EXEMPTION FOR BEING AN APPROPRIATE. THAT'S STUDENTS WILL NOT BE THE LADY FROM ATTENDING SCHOOL WAITING FOR A HEALTH OFFICER. DATA ON PHYSICIANS WRITING LARGE NUMBERS OF AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH THE BOARD SAYS IT NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE. AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. AND THEN BEGINNING IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WILL BE REVIEWED IN GRANTED BY THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WHO IS A PHYSICIAN. AND PHYSICIANS CAN APPLY FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR THE PATIENTS AT ANY AGE AND ANY TIME A VALID REASON FOR EXEMPTIONS AND THAT A FIGHT IS SURELY TIMELY ACCESS TO THOSE EXEMPTIONS. THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OR HER DESIGNEES WILL ADLAI EVIDENCE BASED STANDARD OF CARE GUIDELINES TO DETERMINE THE VALIDITY OF THE EXEMPTION REQUEST. THUS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX SIX A PREVENTIVE APPROACH TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE FOR ALL STUDENTS. ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN WHO TRULY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION APPLYING A MODEL SUCCESSFULLY USED IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA WHICH BY THE WAY HAS NOT EXPERIENCE AND MEASLES CASE AND OVER IT IN A DECADE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S POSITIONS. BECAUSE THEY SEEK TO PROTECT THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP AND THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS FROM THREATS TO THEIR SAFETY THE FACTS ARE CLEAR VACCINES KEEP US SAFE AND OUR CHILDREN SAFE BY PREVENTING SERIOUS INFECTIONS. I STRICTLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] CENTER STONE. THANK YOU -- MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THAT. AS A CO AUTHOR OF SB -- TWO SEVENTY SEVEN I WAS VERY PROUD OF OF WORKING WITH DOCTOR PAN I THINK IT WAS A RIGHTEOUS LEGISLATION. AND AS A PHARMACIST -- I FULLY SUPPORT IT. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A 95% HEARD -- IMAGES AYE IMMUNIZED -- CONSTITUENCY -- IF WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT OUR OUR OUR CHILDREN AND EVEN ADULTS. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT I GOT. MEASLES AT THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND I WAS PROPERLY IMMUNIZED CITED NO I NEEDED A SECOND BOOSTER. AND I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A WEEK. I WAS PACKED IN ICE WHEN MY BODILY TEMPERATUREGOT UP OVER A HUNDRED AND SIX AND I ACTUALLY ALMOST DIED -- THE VIRUS -- TACK MY LIVER AND MY WIFE AND MY MOM WERE IN THE HOSPITAL AND THE DOCTOR SAID I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT. BY THE WILL OF GOD I'VE I MADE IT. AND I'M HAPPY THAT. I WAS ABLE -- TO MOVE ON TO ALTHOUGH WAS. TOOK ME ABOUT A MONTH TO RECOVER. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT -- MEASLES AND CHICKENPOX ARE KIND OF SYNONYMOUS OF ANOTHER THEY'RE NOT. MEASLES IS A VERY EARLY DISEASE. IT CAN KILL YOU ONE OUT OF A THOUSAND INFANTS CHILDREN DIED SO. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- REGARDING SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX IT MANDATES AS OF A CHILD NEEDS A VACCINATION MEDICAL EXEMPTION THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER MUST SUBMIT A REQUEST. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND DOCTOR PAN RIGHTFULLY -- DESCRIBES AT THE OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IS THE PHYSICIAN IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE CDC GUIDELINES FOR MAKING EXEMPTIONS -- WHICH TO ME IS -- MAYBE NOT AS COMPREHENSIVE AS IT SHOULD BE. AFTER TO RECEIVE THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WILL REVIEW THE REQUEST. FORMAN EITHER APPROVE OR DENY THE EXEMPTION [inaudible] SO. WHAT WHY ARE WE HERE TODAY? WE ARE HERE TODAY. BECAUSE A HANDFUL OF POSITIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAVE ABUSED THEIR AUTHORITY. AND THEIR POSITIONS [inaudible] TO WRITE. NON LEGITIMATE EXEMPTIONS A MAJORITY OF PHYSICIANS THAT ARE WRITING FOR EXEMPTIONS ARE DOING IT. BASED ON THERE. MEDICAL TEACHINGS AND THEIR VIEWPOINTS OF OF MEDICAL SCIENCE. THE DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN HAVING THE MEDICAL BOARD. ENFORCE THIS NEW LAW AS OPPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CANNOT. SITE A PHYSICIAN THE CAMP. BUT THERE LICENSE ON PROBATION THEY CAN'T REVOKE. THE PRIVILEGES OF BEING A PHYSICIAN IF THEY'RE OUT FOLLOWING GOOD [inaudible] HIPPOCRATIC [inaudible] BOTH. SO THAT IS A CONCERN OF MINE I THINK THE BILL IS A GOOD BILL. I'M CONCERNED THOUGH THAT IT SHOULD BE THE MEDICAL BOARD THAT OVERSEES THIS AND WE SHOULD BE WEEDING OUT THOSE BAD POSITIONS THAT ARE. JEOPARDIZING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CONSTITUENCY. THIS DISCOVERY OF VACCINES IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE GREATEST MEDICAL ADVANCES OF ALL TIME. AND SECOND OUR STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH. MUST ALWAYS REMAIN A PRIORITY. BUT DESPITE THIS THE FACT THAT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX GREATLY OVER REACHES POWER THE STATE IS TROUBLING. FIRST SB TWO SEVENTY SIX BREAKS THE LEGISLATURE'S PROMISE WE PROMISE WHEN WE DID SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THAT. WE WOULD ALLOW FOR A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THAT A PARENT OR CHILD WHO HAS LEGITIMATE CONCERNS CAN GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. I GOT A MOTHER. BUT I SAW [inaudible] FOR DINNER -- TWO NIGHTS AGO. THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMMUNE DEFICIENCY [inaudible] AND SHE HAS EXEMPTIONS FOR HER CHILDREN THAT SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET. IF THIS LAW IS PASSED UNLESS THERE ARE AMENDMENTS TAKEN. SHOULD THE BILL MOVE OFF THE FLOOR AND INTO THE ASSEMBLY WHICH I HOPE. THAT THE AUTHOR WORKABLE CONSIDER HER SITUATION SHE WANTS TO STAY IN CALIFORNIA SHE WANTS HER CHILDREN TO STAY. IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- BUT MAY BE FORCED TO BE MAY MAKING -- AN IMPORTANT DECISION -- IF THIS GOES THROUGH WITHOUT BEING CHANGED. MANY OF US VOTED FOR SB TWO SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF VACCINATIONS. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH. AND AGAIN IT'S MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX DIRECTLY UNDERMINES THE PREVIOUS DECISIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE MAKES US [inaudible] LOOK LIKE. WE'RE GOING BACK ON A WORD. AND TO ME. AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. WE NEED TO KEEP YOUR WORK. THIS BILL MAKES ME. A CO AUTHOR. TO SEVENTY SEVEN LOOK LIKE I'M NOT KEEPING MY WORD. IN AN EMAILS. I GET ACCUSED OF BEING A LIAR IF I SUPPORT THIS BILL. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO AND MY FRIEND WHO WAS AUTHORED THIS BILL REPEATEDLY EXPLAINED THAT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL TO TARGET UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS SELLING FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. I APPLAUD HIM FOR THAT. IF THIS IS [inaudible] THE CASE. WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE SHOWING SO? IF THIS IS IN FACT THE CASE WHY ISN'T THE MEDICAL BOARD DEALING WITH THESE BAD ACTORS. THESE. INAPPROPRIATE ACTIONS BY THESE POSITIONS. WHY ARE THEY NOT HAVING THEIR LICENSES REVIEWED? PROBE PUT ON PROBATION. OR IF THEY DON'T LISTEN AND FOLLOW. GOOD MEDICAL PRACTICE GETTING THEIR LICENSES IN FACT WE VOTE. IF BAD DOCTORS OF THE PROBLEM THE BACK OFFERS MORE DISCIPLINE AND SANCTION. BUT NOT AT THE COST OF LIFE AND LIBERTIES OF FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AS A PHARMACIST MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AT A GREATLY OPENS A DOOR OF LIABILITY IN LAWSUITS TO DOCTORS AND THE STATE. SECTION TO PROVIDE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CREATE AND KEEP A DATABASE. WITH A CHILD'S NAME. IN ALL MEDICAL RECORDS. IN A SOCIAL MEDIA WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE MADE PUBLIC EVEN THINGS THAT ARE MEANT TO BE MADE PRIVATE. HEALTH MATTERS ESPECIALLY MEDICAL RECORDS NOT ONLY DESERVE. BUT ALSO LEGALLY WARRANT PRIVACY IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK HER SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO GET MEDICAL HISTORIES. OF OUR CHILDREN AND WHETHER THEY HAVE EXEMPTION THEY'RE NOT EXEMPTIONS REPORT THAT TO THE HELP HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I HOPE THAT AT THIS BILL MOVES OFF THE FLOOR. THAT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD NOT BE OF INTEREST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SHOULD BE REDACTED. AND IF NOTHING ELSE JUST THE DATA OF THE EXCEPTIONS BEING FORWARDED. TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH. I THINK THAT THIS DATABASE THAT IS BEING CREATED SB TWO SEVENTY SIX COULD. VERY WELL BE A VIOLATION OF HELP. IT'S A GREAT OVERREACH OF GOVERNMENT POWER IN ULTIMATELY VIOLATES [inaudible] INNOCENT CHILDREN'S [inaudible] PRIVACY [inaudible] COLLEAGUES. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE PLAIN AND SIMPLE. THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR ARE GOOD. AND I THINK THAT IT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. BY EMPOWERING THE MEDICAL BOARD. NOT PUTTING MANDATES ON SCHOOLS. AND RELEASING OUR CHILDREN'S MEDICAL INFORMATION. THIS BILL IS UNPRECEDENTED AND A DANGEROUS INTRUSION. NOT ONLY INTO THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. BUT ALSO THE PERSONAL LIBERTIES OF THE PARENTS. AND THEIR CHILDREN. AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUE. I SUPPORT WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO I JUST DON'T THINK THAT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS THE RIGHT TOOL TO GET US THERE FOR THOSE REASONS. I REGIONAL VOTE ON TWO SEVENTY SIX SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. OF MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE -- AND I APPRECIATE THE THE COURAGE IT TAKES. TO TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CONCERNS REYES AND SUMMER LEGITIMATE SUMMER NOT. IN FACT MANY ARE NOT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAND UP -- AND ADDRESS THE THE ILLEGITIMATE -- MET MEDICAL AND NONMEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SOUGHT BY FOLKS OVER THE YEARS -- BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE CENTER FOR SACRAMENTO'S WILLINGNESS. TO TEMP TO RESOLVE -- SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AROUND FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY. AROUND -- SERIES ALLERGIES AROUND OTHER VERY. IMPORTANT MEDICAL ISSUES THAT HAVE A LEGITIMATE PLACE -- IN THIS CONVERSATION. AND NOTING THAT THE CDC GUIDELINES THAT ARE CURRENTLY MENTION IN THE BILL. MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY EXPANSIVE OR RESPONSIVE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR UPDATED. BUT WE NEED. A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. THAT IS STILL IN THIS FRAMEWORK TO BE SOLID AND DEPENDABLE AND WORKABLE. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT. THE CD PH REVIEW THAT THE BILL ARTICULATES [inaudible] IS THE UNWARRANTED INTRUSION IN A DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE APPEALS PROCESS THAT IT CONTAINS ALREADY. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR DOCTORS TO ASSERT THEIR CASE ON BEHALF OF THEIR PATIENTS. IT IS TRUE THAT SOME PEOPLE TRULY CAN'T DEAL WITH. ARE THESE VACCINATIONS AND FOR THOSE PEOPLE I THINK THERE IS RECOURSE IN HERE -- I THINK THAT THE DOCTOR IS LOOKING DEEPER INTO. HOW TO THE CURRENT AND ACCURATE ABOUT? THAT LIST -- I THINK IT'S A TOUGH THE TOUGH. NEEDLE TO THREAD BUT I THINK YOU'VE DONE IT TODAY. FOR PRESENT PURPOSES I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MAY I POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. BE PREPARED FOR SESSION YES MAYBE SEE. I HEARD SOME COMMENTS FOR MY STEAM REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE WITH A BACKGROUND IN. MEDICINE AND PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE. ANY BROUGHT UP A POINT THAT I WANT TO JUST KIND OF FIGURED OUT WITH YOU. IS THERE A REASON WHY THE APPELLATE BODY FOR THIS WOULD NOT BE AT THE MEDICAL BOARD AS OPPOSED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT -- THERE'S TWO PROCESSES AND I THINK WE SHOULD CAN'T COMPLETE THE TWO SO THERE'S ONE ABOUT WHETHER YOU. IN TERMS THE GRANTING OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION ITSELF AND IN FACT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE MEDICAL. COMMUNITY AS I SAID THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA AMERICAN KHAKI AFTER. THAT INTENSELY TAKES A PREVENTIVE APPROACH NOW THIS BILL ALSO BY THE WAY ALLOWS THE PROVIDES INFORMATION TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO CALIFORNIA'S AGAIN PURSUE THEIR ROLE IN TERMS OF PURSUING IN TERMS OF BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE. THE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE ACTING UNPROFESSIONALLY IN FACT YOU KNOW I THIS BILL IS FOUR YEARS AFTER SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION PROBLEM HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE TWO SEVEN SEVEN WAS PASSED. THAT NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD THE MEDICAL BOARD IS EXPRESSED THAT THEY ARE CHALLENGED. IN TRYING TO PURSUE THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE THE MEDICAL BOARD PROCESS GENERALLY REQUIRES THE COOPERATION OF THE PATIENT OR THE PATIENT'S FAMILY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHILD. AND THESE FAMILIES ARE NOT COOPERATING BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CAHOOTS WITH THE POSITIONS THEY PAID FOR AND THEY WANTED TO MEDICAL ATTENTION SO THEY PAID FOR IT THEY'RE NOT ABOUT TO TURN AROUND AD MEDICAL BOARD SAID OVER HERE BY THE WAY WE WANT TO SHARE THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING. ON WITH THIS POSITION WHO IS ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF IS FRUSTRATED THEY ACTUALLY DID -- THE PLACE ONE POSITION WHO THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO FIND A COOPERATIVE FAMILY WITH -- TO ACTUALLY PUT ON PROBATION THAT'S DR BOB'S YEARS IN ORANGE COUNTY -- HE WAS ACTUALLY PUT ON PROBATION FOR ISSUING AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION BUT IT'S VERY HARD. TO IDENTIFY GET A FAMILY TO COOPERATE THE OTHER ISSUE IS THIS CURRENTLY. THE WAY THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION PROCESS WORKS CURRENTLY IS IS THAT. FAMILY GOES OF PHYSICIAN DAVE. APPLY A MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- THEN THEY TAKE THEN IT GOES TO THE SCHOOL THERE'S NO PLACE WHERE THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN ACTUALLY GET A LIST OF ALL THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS UNLESS THE SCHOOLS TURNED OVER AND BY THE WAY WHEN THE SCHOOLS RIGHT INFORMATION THEY DON'T PROVIDE THE NAME OF THE PATIENTS. WHO AFTER RECEIVED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THERE'S NO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS FORCE THEN TO SAY WELL WE KNOW THAT THE SCHOOL SAID? THIS DOCTOR SO FOR EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO ONE PHYSICIAN WROTE ALMOST A THIRD OF ALL THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. FROM FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD IS IS THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE PATIENTS IT IS SO THEN WHAT THAT HAVE TO DO IS THEY HAVE TO GO TO A COURT SAID. THAT THE SAY OKAY WELL THE PARENTS AREN'T COOPERATING WITH US YOU'RE NOT PROVIDING US THE INFORMATION -- NOT VOLUNTEERING TO SAY OH YEAH BY THE WAY THIS PERSON. GIVE US A MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- AND AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD LOOK AT MY CHILD'S RECORDS SO NOW THE THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS TO GO TO COURT AND BASICALLY THEN SUBPOENA NOT. INDIVIDUAL RECORDS BUT SAVINGS THAT WE WANT ALL THE RECORDS OF THIS POSITION. TO GO AND SEARCH THROUGH IN FINE WHICH PATIENTS THEY GRANTED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO ASSUMING THEY KEPT ACTIVE RECORDS. AND THEN -- AND THEN FINALLY AND INVESTIGATE THAT SO IT'S A TREMENDOUS BURDEN ON THE MEDICAL BOARD IN FACT THE MEDICAL BOARD IS EXPRESSED THAT WITHOUT THIS BILL WITHOUT THIS BILL THEY ARE TRULY ON ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY GO AFTER. THESE PHYSICIANS ARE OF ACTING UNPROFESSIONALLY. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PASSIONS ON THIS ISSUE -- I AM I AM THE FATHER OF TWO YOUNG BOYS. AND SO I'VE HEARD IN MY DISTRICT -- JUST CASUALLY IN AROUND -- AROUND THE SCHOOL -- FOLKS EXPRESSING CONCERN. MOSTLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT -- THOSE FEW INDIVIDUALS THAT. ARE PHILOSOPHICALLY DISINCLINED TOWARD VACCINATION ARE CONTAMINATING. THE LARGER A STUDENT BODY AND EXPOSING THEM. NOW I'M NOT A SCIENTIST SO I HAVE TO RELY ON FOLKS LIKE YOU AND IN CENTER STONE IT CETERA. BUT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLICATION. AND YOU ARE SEEKING THE FAR REACHING HAMMER OF THE STATE TO STEP IN. AND WOOD I'M I'M STILL OF THIS OPINION THAT IF WE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM DO WE NEED THE HAMMER OF THE STATE. OR CAN THIS. BE LEGISLATIVELY ENHANCED AND STILL KEEP IT -- WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND IT SOUNDS OF FIGHTING THEIR SUPPORT [inaudible] FOR THIS. THAT IS OPPOSITE THAT DIRECTION. IT'S A QUESTION OR DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER OR NOT IT IS THAT'S A QUESTION NO ANSWER IF IT'S NOT A QUESTION AND I WILL. CLOSE I'LL LEAVE IT AS AS IT OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWER MY QUESTION. VERY GOOD. SENATOR MORE LOCKED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT HAS GENERATED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CONTACTS TO MY OFFICE EMAILS PHONE CALLS CERTAINLY SEEN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WONDERFUL. PEOPLE COME TO THE CAPITAL AGAIN -- LOOK AND LONG LINES TO EXPRESS THEIR CONCERN SO FOR ALL OF THEM I SAY THANK YOU FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. VISITING SACRAMENTO. AND ATTENDING PUBLIC HEARINGS -- I ALSO. SORT OF BEEN SAID LET'S DO SOME MORE DIGGING. IT -- OF SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE [inaudible] CONCERNED. AND IT SORT OF REMINDS ME OF A FRUSTRATION I HAVE -- I CALLED A SAFETY FOR ALL APPROACH. I IN NEWPORT BEACH MANY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A MURDER ON THE BEACH. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT OUR BEACHES IN ORANGE COUNTY WE THEY THEY SHUT HIM DOWN AT TEN O'CLOCK -- JEEP COMES BY INTELLIGENT A TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF ONE MURDER AND NOW EVERYONE HAS. TO TO LEAVE EARLY JUST BARELY GET. DARK AT TEN O'CLOCK COULD BARELY GET THE FIRE GOING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE TO TO LEAVE AND I JUST. I JUST WORRY ABOUT ONE BIG BLANKET ANSWER. FOR ONE INCIDENT OR SO. SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR VACCINES BUT SP TWO SEVEN SEVEN ESTABLISHED PROCESS. FOR ISSUING BALLAD MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AS MANY SINCERE PEOPLE ARE ALLERGIC TO THE SAY THE MMR VACCINE INGREDIENTS. AND THEY SHOULD RECEIVE. A MEDICAL EXEMPTION AND AND AND HERE WE ARE NOW LEGISLATING THE PRACTICE OF MEDIC MEDICINE AND THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME. WHEN AS THE SENATOR FROM TO MAKE A SAID WE SHOULD WE SHOULD PUNISH THE WRONGDOERS SO. AND WE SHOULD DO THAT THROUGH THE EXISTING IN NORMAL CHANNELS NOW I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SINCE HIS NAME IS INVOKED THE PRIVILEGE OF TALKING TO DOCTOR BOB SEARS I IN MY RESEARCH ON ON THIS BILL. I TALKED TO MANY A HE SAYS IT TAKES IF YOU WANT TO GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THROUGH HIS PRACTICE IT TAKES AN HOUR AND A HALF. OF QUESTIONS IN RESEARCH IT'S IT'S IT'S A VERY DETAILED PROCESS AND HE DOESN'T GIVE THEM DIFFICULT PROCESS TO GET. MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO NOW TO TRY TO INSERT STATE BUREAUCRATS TO INTERVENE IN THIS PROCESS SEEMS TO ME IS AN INVASION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THAT WE HAVE A DOCTOR PATIENT IS THAT SHORT. IT SHORT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARENT AND CHILD AND SO. I LOOK AT THE STATISTICS DEATHS BY MEASLES HAVE BEEN ZERO IN DECADES. BUT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BY THE MMR VACCINE. LOOKING AT THE HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION'S WEBSITE. THERE IS A VACCINE THERE'S A PAGER VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION DATA OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES FROM 1-989-220-0019 THERE'S BEEN A TOTAL OUTLAY OF FOUR POINT ONE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN SETTLEMENTS. THREE POINT EIGHT TWO BILLION THE PETITIONERS WITH THE REMAINDER TO IT TWO ATTORNEYS FOR THEIR FEES AND COSTS. ONE RECENT LAWSUIT REVEALED SOMETHING RATHER INTERESTING. THAT THE REQUIRED SAFETY TESTING FOR VACCINES HASN'T BEEN DONE IN THIRTY TWO YEARS. WITH MORE MANDATES ON CONCERN MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS. ARE WE GIVING YET ANOTHER REASON FOR THEM TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA. OR NOT COME AT ALL. CALIFORNIA HAS A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS. WITH ALL OF THE OTHER BARRIERS LET'S HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON SB TWO SEVEN SIX BEFORE OUR GOOD DOCTOR STRUCTURE HANDS AND NEW DOCTOR SELECT STATES THAT ACTUALLY TRUSTS THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT. MISS MADAM PRESIDENT SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE. TO FURTHER INFRINGEMENTS ON PERSONAL FREEDOMS. OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE ON SB TWO SEVEN SIX THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT [inaudible] SENATOR RUSSELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CENTER PAN AYE I RISE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON BEHALF OF SO MANY FAMILIES IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. WHO MANY OF HOME? DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS. TO THIS KIND OF YOU KNOW HEALTH CARE AND THE VACCINATION WHO LIVED IN FEAR IN THEIR OWN. THEIR OWN PREVIOUS COMMUNITIES. SO. I DON'T KNOW I WAS IN HERE WHEN THERE ARE OTHER BILL WAS PASSED. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WE ALWAYS LOOK FOR FIXES. AFTER SOMETHING HAS BEEN APPROVED AND PUT INTO PRACTICE. WE LOOK TO SEE WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST TWO THREE YEARS. AND THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THESE UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS. A IS REALLY UPSETTING TO ME BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO TRIGGERED THIS ISSUE SO. YOUR COURAGEOUS OF I SAT THROUGH THAT A HEARING FOR HOURS. EVERY QUESTION BACK AND FORTH YOU WERE VERY YOU HAD ANSWERS YOU'RE VERY DIGNIFIED IN YOUR ANSWERS EVERYONE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY BRING UP THE ISSUES AND SO. I JUST FEEL I HAVE TO SAY THIS PUBLICLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I SUPPORT THAT [inaudible] SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. APPLE THINGS YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONNECTICUT FOR TELLING US THIS STORY -- ABOUT BEING AN ADULT WITH MEASLES AND IT REMINDED ME -- ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WORKING AT THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF Là THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED TO SIGN IN WHERE I BROUGHT THIS. TO EVERYONE'S ATTENTION SO THE IRONY -- THAT WE USE THAT SIGN AND I LEARNED IT -- WORKING WITH STUDENTS SOME OF WHOM WHO HAD LOST THEIR HEARING. AS A RESULT OF A HIGH TEMPERATURE. RESULTING FROM THE MEASLES -- AND SO I WILL NOT FORGET. MY EXPERIENCE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FOR COMMENT. TO A DISEASE. THAT WENT AWAY. THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOME FOR MANY YEARS. I BALANCE THAT WITH THE NOTION THAT. TEAM IS THE HARDEST JOB ON THE PLANET [inaudible] THE HARDEST. OTHER THAN OUR GRAMMY NIGHT IN THAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT. AND WE HAVE TO RELY. ON OUR BEST JUDGMENT WHAT WE BELIEVE IS BEST FOR OUR CHILD AND CONSOLE. WITH THOSE WE TRUST. AND SO WHAT'S DISTURBING ABOUT. IN MY NOW SECOND EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE AS A LEGISLATOR HAVING SAT THROUGH. HOURS OF HEARINGS. HOURS OF MEETINGS WITH CONSTITUENTS AND NON CONSTITUENTS. READING REPORTS LOOKING AT VIDEOS THAT WERE SENT MY WAY. IS HOW DO WE VALIDATE THE INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE IN THE UNIVERSE. HOW DO WE VALIDATED HOW THE WE KNOW THAT IT'S SCIENCE BASED? AN OBJECTIVE AND FAIR. AND SOUL I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. COURSE DOCTRINE COURSE THANK YOU WITH THE SAME QUESTION I POSED TO YOU IN HEALTH COMMITTEE -- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE DEBATING THE ACTUAL MERITS OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE B. L. RIGHT AND THAT WE ARE NOT DEBATING BASED ON FEAR. AND MISS REPRESENTATION. AND SO IF YOU COULD ANSWER FOR ME. IF THE BILL ALLOWS. FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THOSE EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE AFFORDED YES. THIS BILL CERTAINLY ALLOWS MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AFFECT WE WANT TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION SYSTEM SO. THE PURPOSES BILLS ACTUALLY TO PROTECT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. AND WHEN A CHILD RECEIVES A MEDICAL EXEMPTION DAY NEED THE PROTECTION OF THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY DON'T GET INFECTED WITH MEASLES DEVELOP. HEARING LOSS OR OTHER THE QUALITY FROM MEASLES -- EVEN THAT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN INCLUDES OTENTIALLY DEATH -- FOR ONE IN A THOUSAND AND THE STANDARDS BY WHICH THE EXEMPTION REVIEWED IS USING AND IF THEY SAID THE STANDARD OF CARE EVIDENCE BASED -- CDC GUIDELINES -- WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE AMERICAN QUE PEDIATRIC GUIDELINES INCLUDING THOSE AS WELL -- NOW SOME PEOPLE POINT OUT THE FAIRLY SIMILAR THAT'S BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE SPACES PRETTY WELL RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DECADES. OF USING THESE VACCINATIONS SO WE CERTAINLY WANT TO BE SURE THAT CHILDREN WHO NEED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WILL GET. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY NEED MEDICAL EXPENSES WILL GET THEM AND THEN WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL THEY WILL BE SAFE. AT SCHOOL AND THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSES OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ISSUE [inaudible] SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU -- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WANT TO THANK THE CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS I KNOW. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY -- BUT SOMETIMES LEADERSHIP -- MEANS THAT IT TAKES A PERSONAL TOLL AND I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK THE CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO. WE'RE NOT JUST DOING -- ONE STOP AT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT FOR STICKING WITH THAT BECAUSE THIS IS SO CRITICAL FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH. OF OUR STATE AND I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU -- IF THERE IS AN ACTUAL MEDICAL REASON. WHY YOUR CHILD CAN BE VACCINATED YOU CAN STILL GET AN EXEMPTION THIS TEST AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF REVIEW TO DEAL WITH THESE UNSCRUPULOUS UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS? I ALSO THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOT AN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT -- PARENTAL RIGHTS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO VACCINATE THEIR KIDS. THIS IS ABOUT PARENTS WHO ARE TERRIFIED THAT THEIR OWN CHILDREN WHO CANNOT BE VACCINATED. ARE GOING TO BE EXPOSED -- LAST YEAR I MET -- A CONSTITUENT OF MINE -- FATHER WHO HAS A CHILD IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND HAS A BABY AND HIS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE FAMILY WAS TO DROP. THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILD OFF AT SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND HE HAD THE BABY WITH THEM BECAUSE ENOUGH CHILDCARE. AND HE WAS IN A CONUNDRUM BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO BRING HIS BABY INTO THE SCHOOL KNOWING THAT THERE WERE UNVACCINATED CHILDREN IN THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT BABYWAS TOO YOUNG. TO BE VACCINATED SO THIS IS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AND NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. CHILDREN WHO FOR WHOM THERE IS A MEDICAL ISSUE WILL NOT NEED TO BE VACCINATED THEY CAN GET AN EXEMPTION BUT WE MUST PROTECT. THE BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR ALLEN -- MEMBERS A K. A. ALSO WANT -- TO FIRST SAY THAT I'M. HAS THE JOINT AUTHORS ON SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WITH THE CENTER FROM SACRAMENTO. I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT LAW. I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO BOOST VACCINATION RATES SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A WAY THAT -- THAT REALLY HAS HELPED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE KIND OF OUTBREAKS THAT WE SEE IN OTHER STATES. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OUTBREAKS THAT THAT EVICT THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON OREGON. AT THE SAME LEVEL HERE I THINK IT'S LARGELY HAVING TO DO WITH SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN IN IN FACT THEY'RE SIMILAR LAWS PROPOSED IN OREGON WASHINGTON THAT WERE ROLLED BACK BECAUSE OF OF OF THE OF THE OBJECTIONS OF FOLKS -- AND AND IT ALSO THE INTENSITY AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE -- INTO THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO HASBEEN SUBJECT TO EXTRAORDINARY. VICIOUS. VILIFICATION AN ATTACK -- I'VE GOT A CHANCE TO TAKE EXTRA TO LIMIT MYSELF BUT BUT I REALLY I REALLY IT IT. YOU KNOW I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO WHERE. HE HAS SOUGHT TO DO YOU HAVE BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL AND ENGAGED IN AND BUT THERE ARE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR THAT IS IS SO BEYOND THE PALE. AND IT'S REALLY DESPICABLE TO ME AND I THINK THAT THE SENATOR -- HAS HAS HANDLED -- SOME VERY DIFFICULT PEOPLE WITH -- AND THEN SOME DIFFICULT THREATS TO HIS FAMILY -- TO HIS LIVELIHOOD TO HIS HOME. HI WITH A LOT OF GRACE AND DIGNITY [inaudible] I YOU KNOW IT MIGHT A LOT OF A LOT OF FOLKS HERE WEREN'T EVEN HERE DURING THE SP TWO SEVEN SEVEN DEBATE. AND DONE. MY PERSONAL CHALLENGE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT AYE. AYE SO MANY TIMES DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEBATE OVER SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN MADE COMMITMENTS RELATING TO THE GRANTING OF THE MEDICAL EXAMS AND THE THE DISCRETION OF THE DOCTOR ASSOCIATED WITH THE GRANTING MEDICAL EXEMPTION. I'M ON CNN NBC. AND I FACT THOSE MIGHT WOMEN VERY FIRST BILLS I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT LIFE IS GOING TO BE LIKE AND I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN ANY THOSE. CHANNELS EVER SENSE BUT BUT THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS LIKE RIGHT COMING ROUTE THE GATES WITHOUT CREEK THAT WILD EXPERIENCE THAT WE LIVE THROUGH. THAT MANY OF US HERE LIVE THROUGH -- BUT I AM ON THE RECORD SO MANY TIMES TALKING ABOUT THAT AS A CRITICAL PART OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN THAT I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE. WITH THIS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PART OF OF SB TWO SEVEN SIX I DO THINK THE DATA COLLECTION ASPECTS ARE. REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I WOULD PERSONALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DO WHAT CENTER PAN IS TRYING TO DO THROUGH THE MEDICAL BOARD BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. AND I'VE I'VE SPOKEN AT THE CENTER PAN ABOUT THIS AND HE REALLY DOES BELIEVE IN I THINK HE'S A STRONG CASE AS TO WHY THAT. THE WAY HE'S PROPOSE IT IS A IS A CLEANER MCHANISM -- BUT IT EIGHT A BUT IT DOES PUT ME PERSONALLY IN A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT BECAUSE OF THE COMMITMENTS THAT I MADE -- THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE PASSAGE OF SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M LAYING OFF ON THIS -- BECAUSE OF THOSE COMMITMENTS I MADE. AND WANTING TO TO STAND TRUE TO MY WORD -- I I I I DO SHARE THE CORE CONCERNS ABOUT UNSCRUPULOUS DOCTORS. BOB I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROTECT DISCRETION FOR DOCTORS AND I THINK THAT'S AT THE HEART OF WHAT MAKES THIS BILL CHALLENGING AND DONE -- SO THAT'S WHERE I AM WITH THIS BILL AND AND AND I APPRECIATE IT ONCE ATTENTION. SENATOR WAS A JUST A POINT OF INFORMATION MANAGER IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS HERE. I JUST WANTED TO ASK -- WHOEVER CAN MAP PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION THAT IF THE BILL SHOULD THE BILL. NOT SUCCEED TODAY COULD THE BILL STILL BE RECONSIDERED AND AMENDED. COULD BE AMENDED ON THE FLOOR AFTER A VOTE HAS BEEN. THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS IF THE BODY GRANTS RECONSIDERATION YES THE BILL CAN BE CAN BE AMENDED WERE STILL WITHIN THE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU I I JUST -- WANTED ALSO COMMENDTHE AUTHOR FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND IF PEOPLE -- THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT -- SOME OF THESE. DISEASES -- AND SOME OF THESE VIRUSES ARE NOT DEADLY ASK. THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NATIVE AMERICANS THAT -- WERE ALMOST WIPED OFF THE FACE OF OF AMERICA WHO WHO WHO WHO SUCCUMBED TO A LOT OF THESE ILLNESSES -- THIS IS A THESE ARE VERY DEADLY DISEASES AND THE VERY DANGEROUS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME ABOUT IT. I I JUST WANNA I JUST FEEL THE BILL THIS CURRENT BILL GOES A LITTLE BIT -- TOO FAR IN THAT AND THAT IT CUT OUT I THINK THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE YOU'RE SPEAKING POINTS ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT THE CHILDREN. THAT REQUIRE AN EXEMPTION OR FORD AN EXEMPTION I'M WITH YOU THERE WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITH THAT. I I HAVE A I I THINK I HAVE SOME LANGUAGE IT'LL LOOK PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE. CLARITY ON THAT AND AND BASED ON THE SCIENCE AND ALLOWING -- CHILDREN WHO ACTUALLY HAVE OF OF TESTS THAT SHOW THAT THAT -- THEY WOULD. BE HURT BY THIS THAT THAT WOULD INFORMATION WOULD BE PASSED ON TO THE SCHOOL. TO FOR THE SCHOOL TO MAKE FINAL RECOMMEND -- BECAUSE OF DETERMINATION WHETHER THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TO ATTEND I WAS JUST A LITTLE TWEAK IN TERMS OF THE THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AND AND THAT'S JUST MY PROPOSAL IF THE AUTHOR. IS WILLING TO CONSIDER THAT BUT IF FOR THE MOST PART. I'LL JUST -- SEE WITH LOGOS THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR BRIDGES. FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES QUESTION FROM SAN DIEGO -- I'D LIKE. TO POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YOU MAY -- VERSE. I WASN'T HERE WHEN A TWO SEVEN SEVEN WAS PUT FORWARD AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PASSIONS ON THIS PROJECT -- WITH THEAUTHOR TO BE WILLING. TO MODIFY. OR CONSIDER MODIFYING THE BILL TO HAVE IT REMAIN WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OR TO BE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. RATHER THAN THE STATE. BUT AS THE YOU CONSIDER THAT AS AN AMENDMENT -- WE'LL SEE WHERE THINGS GO FROM THERE. SO ACTUALLY WE TOOK US AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY IN APPROPRIATIONS TO INCORPORATE THE MEDICAL BOARD SO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS A PART OF THE BILL -- I WOULD POINT OUT THAT -- THIS BILL IS CRAFTED -- THROUGH A PROCESS IN WHICH WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD ITSELF. AS FAR AS WHAT THEY'RE CHALLENGES WERE WE TALKED TO OF COURSE PUBLIC HELP THE STATE PARK PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS IN THE PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AS WELL AS ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA ME THIS IS THE PERFECT THIS IS THE PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY THE DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. THAT INCLUDES OF COURSE INFORMATION FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO A PREVENTATIVE APPROACH TO BY HAVING THE PARMA PUBLIC HEALTH REVIEW THE EXEMPTION REQUESTS IN FACT THIS IS A MODEL IT'S BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY. IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA SO THIS WE'RE NOT INNOVATING SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE AND IT'S WORKED VERY WELL -- IN WEST VIRGINIA SO THIS IS A PROCESS BY WHICH NUMEROUS PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER BEFORE I SUBMITTED THE BILL KNOWING HOW CONTENTIOUS IT WOULD BE. I BROUGHT TOGETHER VERY STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH TO BE SURE WE KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND WE ADDRESS -- THE UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS WHO ARE WRITING THE EXEMPTIONS AND THIS IS THE RESULT OF THAT PROCESS AND SO THAT THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS IN ITS FORM IT IS I'M OF COURSE ALWAYS HAPPY TO HEAR FROM. MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT -- YOU KNOW AMENDMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS THEY HAVE FOR THE BILL BUT I ALSO WANT OF COURSE WE'VE ALL DONE BILLS BEFORE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT OF A PROCESS WHICH WE ENGAGE RIGHT PEOPLE LOOKING AT WHAT'S THE BEST APPROACH TO THE BILL IN THE PRESS TODAY -- WILL -- FEEL THAT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND THAT'S THE RESULT OF THIS. THING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. BY SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. DR PAN OF COURSE. THANK YOU -- MAY I THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THAT HE CONSULTED ALL STAKEHOLDERS I'M WANTING I WANT TO KNOW IF HE CONSULTED AT PARENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. IN FACT ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL ARE IS APPARENT TO FAX THE CALIFORNIA AND SO YES PARENTS WERE CONSULTED. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR PAN YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I WANT TO THANK ALL MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DISCUSSION. ON THIS BILL -- IS AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WE RIGHT NOW HAVE AN ACTIVE MEASLES OUTBREAK GOING ON LEASES HAPPENS WAS CONTAGIOUS DISEASE. THAT'S THE ONE WE HEAR ABOUT FIRST THAT WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN TWENTY TEN TO GET A PROTEST THIS OUTBREAK THAT KILLED TEN INSTANCE AND OTHER VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE. WE HAVE OTHER DISEASES AS WELL THAT THAT'S A THAT'S THE REASON WHY THIS LEGISLATURE THE ONLY PASSED SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN BUT ALSO PASS REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE IMMUNIZATIONS FOR SCHOOL ENTRY IT'S THIS LEGISLATURE DETECTED THAT. SO IT WAS MADE REFERENCE TO BY SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT TWO SEVEN SEVEN I FEEL LIKE I HAVE. TO CORRECT THE RECORD REGARDING. WHAT HAPPENED TO SEVEN SEVEN SO IN SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN ACTUALLY THE BILL DID NOT ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS? ACCEPTED AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN -- AND ASSEMBLY HEALTH OF MY AMENDMENT -- THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION ITSELF. IN FACT THE HOPE WAS IS THAT. BASICALLY THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION PRIOR TO SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WAS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE POSITION THAT WAS NOT A NEW INNOVATION AND SB -- TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE WERE HAPPY TO LEAVE IT THERE BECAUSE WE FIGURED THAT THE CHILD'S PHYSICIAN WOULD TALK. TO THE FAMILY AND THEY WOULDN'T DO AND WOULD PROVIDE. ACCURATE AND APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS NOT? FAMILIES GOING TO THEIR OWN CHILD POSITION FACT WE SEEN AND NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA MY DOCTOR WILL GIVE MY CHILD MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO I WENT AND BOUGHT. ONE THIS IS NOT WHAT WE INTENDED WITH SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND THE EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTION THAT IS NOT THE PROMISE THAT WE MADE THAT WE WOULD SAY IT'S OKAY FOR PHYSICIANS TO PROFIT FROM SELLING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM PATIENTS THAT THEY DON'T REGULARLY CARE. FOR THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THE PROBLEM IS IT'S THE S IS POINTED OUT IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT THE CHILD WHO GOT THE EXEMPTION DO NOW ISN'T VACCINATED. IT AFFECTS THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE ABOUT WELL A FAMILY MADE DECISION FOR HER OWN CHILD. IN FACT EVEN UNDER THREE TWO SEVEN SEVEN THEY HAVE THE CHOICE WHETHER TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD OR NOT IF THEY DON'T GIVE INFORMED CONSENT THEIR CHILD DOESN'T GET VACCINATED. BUT THERE IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT AND THAT CONSEQUENCES IT RELATE TO THEIR CHILD REALLY TO THE OTHER CHILDREN AND WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. SO I WOULD MAKE IT AGAIN I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA -- BASICALLY -- ONE NEEDS INFORMATION THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IN ORDER TO DO ENFORCEMENT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO BE SURE OUR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE. SO CERTAINLY YES WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE BAD DOCTORS BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE THE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND I WOULD MAKE A NOTE THAT -- IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THE EXEMPTIONS AND WHAT EXETER. YEAH WE HAVE A WE HAVE INCORPORATED TO BUILD THE CDC GUIDELINES WERE LOOKING AT ALSO INCLUDING SAID REFERRING TO THE EIGHTY GUIDELINES. IF THERE ARE OTHER EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES OF PEOPLE WISH TO SHARE WERE CERTAINLY ALWAYS OPEN TO LOOKING AT THIS -- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE IN TERMS OF PRIVACY -- SO WE TALK ABOUT THE DATA BASE FOR THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF THE HEALTH ACTUALLY MAINTAINS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DATABASES CURRENTLY WE HAVE A CANCER DATABASE THEY AFFECT. STD DATABASE SO AND THEY ARE BOUND BY THE SAME PRIVACY LAWS AND SEEM AS A MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT ACTUALLY. AGAIN THIS IS IT THAT THE VOTE THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WOULD GET AS THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET INFORMATION ON A FORM THAT THEY WOULD DESIGNATE THE PHYSICIAN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THE SENATE FOR THE MEDICAL ENGINE IT'S NOT THAT. BASICALLY THAT THE THE PART OF THE HEALTH WITH ACTUALLY ASK FOR THE ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORD OF THE CHILD. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTUALLY. GRABBING THE ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORD FOR A CHILD THE PHYSICIAN WAS CERTIFIED THEY EXAMINE THE CHILD IT WAS CERTIFIED AT THIS IS THE CONDITIONS BY WHICH WE ARE SEEKING MEDICAL EXEMPTION OF THOSE ARE VALID REASONS THAT ARE BOTH OF THE GRANT. EFFECT WE EXPECT THAT PHYSICIANS WOULD BE HONEST IN WHAT THEY A TEST TO SEE IF THEY AREN'T. WELL I GUESS THAT'S WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD GET INVOLVED IN OF COURSE SINCE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AS IS INFORMATION SO WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WITH IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES RAISED ABOUT PRIVACY THE ISSUES RAISED ABOUT -- THE OUT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT THE HOW THEM THE TOP PART OF THE CAL TO TAKE CARE OF THIS INFORMATION IS SOMETHING THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL TAKE COMFORT IN I ALSO JUST HAVE TO BRIEFLY MENTION THAT THAT THERE ARE SOME IF THIS INFORMATION -- SHARED -- REGARDING FIRST OF ALL VACCINES ARE TO THE THOROUGHLY TESTED OF ALL -- MATT PHARMACEUTICALS THAT -- MEDICATIONS -- THAT THERE'S ANY SENSE OF THE INSTITUTE MEDICINE DID NUMEROUS REPORTS THAT THE CLAIM THAT THERE'S NO SAFETY. TESTING OF A FAX SCENES IS IS AND CERTAINLY A COMPLETE. IT IS CERTAINLY -- MISINFORMED -- I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT -- I WAS REFERRED TO THE MMR SAFETY -- THERE IS BEEN NO RECENT KNOWN CASE OF ANY DEATHS FROM MMR SO THAT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT SPEND -- IS UPSET WELL ESTABLISHED THE MMR IS A SAFE VACCINE CERTAINLY THERE ARE CONTRA INDICATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE GUIDELINES SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE CORRECT THE RECORD THERE I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS QUESTION I STRICTLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN MESSENGER GLAZER AND HAPPILY INTO EDUCATION FINANCE. BETTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS ANOTHER EASY BILL TO CONSIDER TODAY. SB FOURTEEN WOULD AUTHORIZE AN EIGHTY BILLION DOLLAR BOND ON THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT. FOR FACILITIES AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A DECADE SINCE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE BEEN ASKED TO DEDICATE FUNDS TO BUILD AND REPAIR. HIGHER EDUCATION CLASSROOMS RESEARCH LABS IN LIBRARIES ACROSS OUR STATE. AND THERE'S BEEN NO HIGHER EDUCATION SPECIFIC BOND PASS SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO ACCORDING TO BOTH SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. THEY HAVE COMBINED CAPITAL NEEDS EXCEEDING SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM PROJECTS. WE ALL KNOW HOW VITAL OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE TO OUR CALIFORNIA'S. ECONOMY. STUDENTS NEED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH CLASSROOMS LIBRARIES AND LABS THAT ARE GOING TO PREPARE THEM AND US. FOR OUR FUTURE. AND VOTERS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE THE PROUD LEGACY OF MAINTAINING. AND IMPROVING OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND WITHOUT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE [inaudible] SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I WANT -- TO COMMEND -- THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL -- I AM. A CO AUTHOR I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR -- I THINK -- THE EQUAL DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE UC IN THE CSU SYSTEM I'M PROUD -- TO TO HAVE -- MULTIPLE UNIVERSITIES IN OR AROUND MY DISTRICT HI AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF OUR OF HIGHER EDUCATION CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED. AND I KNOW THAT -- IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD NOT BE IN A SITUATION WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS LIKE THIS -- WOULD BE PUT FORWARD THROUGH A BOND -- BUT IN THAT THERE BE OTHER MEANS AVAILABLE. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SO GREAT THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY -- FORWARD BUT IT AS A WORD OF OF ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE AUTHOR -- IN ACTUAL POSE A QUESTION TO IF IT'S OKAY MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR GLAZERS YEAH YES YOU MAY PROCEED HOW WILL THE UNIVERSITIES YOU SEE OR SEE ISSUE PRIORITIZE WHERE THE FUNDING GOES. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I WILL BE ADVOCATING FOR FRESNO STATE FOR EXAMPLE -- SO I WANT TO MAKE I WANT TO FIND OUT -- IS THERE A CALCULATION WARS -- FORMULA -- WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS ON WHICH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WE GET PRIORITY. THANK YOU LIVE TO THE SENATOR FROM PRESS THE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CO AUTHORSHIP OF THIS MEASURE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH SYSTEMS HAVE -- FIVE YEAR CAPITAL OUTLAY -- PLANS THAT THAT EACH JOB GOVERNING BOARD -- DEVELOPS AND HERE'S THROUGH PUBLIC -- HEARING PROCESS IS THE BILL SYSTEMS HAVE TO RECEIVE INPUT FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS HOLDERS INCLUDINGTHE CAMPUSES. AND THAT OUT OF THAT PROCESS THEY IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT FIT WITHIN THAT. FIVE YEAR CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN I SHOULD THIS MEASURE OF BE PASSED A HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND BY THE VOTERS I CERTAINLY WOULD STIMULATE THAT EFFORT -- TO GO BEYOND THE THAT THE THE NARROW SCOPE FOR PROJECTS THEY FELT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE FUNDED IN FIVE YEARS. TO I'M SURE AT EXTEND THE ROBUST CONSULTATION PROCESS THAT BUILT THERE KNOWN. FOR AND SO I WOULD -- WOULD BE MY EXPECTATION THAT. YOURSELF AND SUPPORTERS OF FRESNO STATE IN THE OTHER UNIVERSITIES WOULD HAVE A EQUAL AND AMPLE OPPORTUNITY -- TO ENCOURAGE SUPPORT FOR THEIR THEIR ACUTE NEEDS THAT THEY'RE FACING. THANK YOU HI STROLLING VIRGIN AYE VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I AM -- COLLEAGUES I'M A PROUD. THE ISSUE GRADUATE. IN FACT -- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY LONG BEACH RECOGNIZE ME IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS THE ALUMNI OF THE YEAR. FROM ITS COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. THERE WAS A HONORED TO HAVE GEORGIAN GLORIA GLORIA DEUKMEJIAN AT THE DINNER. SITTING RIGHT THERE WILL BE -- WHAT I ACCEPTED THE HONOR? I AM PROUD TO HAVE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE IN MY THIRTY SEVEN DISTRICT. YOU SEE I COMMEMORATED THEIR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY RECENTLY I PARTICIPATED THAT CELEBRATE TORY. DINNER WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER AND YOU SEE I WAS BRAND NEW. IT WAS LIKE I WANT TO GO THERE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS IN THE HILLS. FOR MUCH DIFFERENT NOW WITH ALL THE INFILL AND ALL THE TREES GROWING BUT COLLEAGUES -- I FULLY APPRECIATE UNDERSTAND THE EFFORT TO BAR AND BUILD. BUT I HAVE. A FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THIS NUMBER THEM IF I COULD MADAM PRESIDENT NUMBER. ONE THE GENERAL FUND WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL FIX COST. WHAT WILL WE CUT? TO ACCOMMODATE THIS REQUIRED BUDGET ALLOCATION. TO THE TOTAL INTEREST COST IS ANTICIPATED TO BE FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. I APPRECIATE. PAYING THE BOND HOLDERS. BUT PAYING CASH WOULD REDUCE THE OVERALL COSTS BY SEVENTY ONE POINT 25% [inaudible] THREE THEN THERE IS OUR CREDIT RATING. WERE THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM. FOR THE TEN MOST POPULOUS STATES WITHIN THE STAFF REPORT DID YOU BEEN PROVIDED. FOR DEBT TO PERSONAL INCOME WERE ALSO THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM. FIVE THE DEBT PER CAPITA ALSO THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM. SIX DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF STATE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. ALSO THIRD FROM THE BOTTOM WE ARE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK GOODNESS FOR NEW YORK IN ILLINOIS. IF OTHERWISE BE A BB LAST. BUT I DIDN'T COME THE THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO BECOME ILLINOIS. EIGHT CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF ALL FIFTY STATES CURRENTLY IT'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION AS OF JUNE. THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT IS TODAY MARCH MAY TWENTY SECOND. AND WE STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE. THIRTY EIGHTEEN M. WHAT WILL PROBABLY FIND IS THAT THE CONTROLLER HAS TO ADD ARE UNRESTRICTED AND GIVE ME. ARE -- RETIREE MEDICAL ARE UNDER. PAID RETIREE MEDICAL LIABILITY THAT IT. WAS NINETY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AS OF LECTURE SHE'S COME OUT WITH A LETTER THE LAST WEEK OR SO SAYING IT'S DOWN TO MAYBE EIGHTY SIX BILLION. BUT YOU ADD THAT TO THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE BILLION AND WE ARE. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY BILLION WITH AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT WHERE A QUARTER TRILLION DOLLARS. NINE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH RECESSIONS BAT BOND PAYMENTS ARE FIXED COSTS YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY THEM THEY ARE NOT VARIABLE. AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GOES ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK. AND THEN IT WILL BE THE TIME WHEN THE TAXPAYERS WILL SAY WHY DID YOU PUT THAT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BOND MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY THEY PASSED 90% OF THE TIME SO COLLEAGUES. I'D I'D. I APPRECIATE THE GOOD BECAUSE I'M A BENEFICIARY OF THE CSU SYSTEM. BUT COLLEAGUES WE'VE GOT TO FIX OUR BALANCE SHEET. WE'VE GOT TO GET FROM THIRD AT THE BOTTOM. WE CAN DO BETTER. AND WE'VE GOT TO START REALLY LOOKING AT OUR FINANCES. SO I ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE. ON SB FOURTEEN THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANKS VERY MUCH SENATOR ON MEMBERS ARE RISING IN STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL AYE AYE ACTUALLY HEAR THE CONCERNS OF THE CENTER FROM ORANGE COUNTY I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE TAKEN ACCOUNT AND ENGAGE WITH BY. BY THAT THE LEAD AUTHOR -- HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT -- THAT. THAT IF YOU CAN FIND THE RIGHT TERMS. YEAH IT'S IT'S THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT ARE PRECISELY BEST SUITED. TO BE HANDLED BY A BOT. ULTIMATELY IT'S THE STUDENTS OF THE FUTURE WHO WILL MOST BENEFIT FROM THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL HAPPEN AS A RESULT. OF THIS -- THIS THIS BILL AND AND BOND IF IF IF APPROVED. OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE INTENSE DISCUSSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR A LEVEL THE PART OF FINANCE -- WITH THE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO ENSURE THAT IF WE DO MOVE FORWARD THIS WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SO -- SO AS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE THE ABSOLUTE BEST TERMS IN PLACE. BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENORMOUS INFRASTRUCTURAL DEFICITS AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL RIGHT NOW AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE WANT TO GO WHERE WE NEED TO GO AS A STATE. MOVING FORWARD INTO THE ECONOMY -- IT INTO INTO THE INTO THIS UNCERTAIN FUTURE WE HAVE TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF FACILITIES AND UNMET NEEDS AT THE CAL STATE AND YOU SEE. IT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IT IF IF ANY OF YOU LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF OF A OF A INFRASTRUCTURE ONE OH ONE WITH THE GUYS UNIVERSITIES WILL BE HAPPY. TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AN ENORMOUS NEED THERE IS OUT THERE FOR HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. SO I I I THINK THIS IS A WELL CRAFTED BOND HI I HEAR THE CONCERNS AND I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BE ENGAGED IN AND AND DISCUSSED AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK FOR FUTURE TAXPAYERS BUT IT'S STILL FUTURE TAXPAYERS IT WILL BEGIN THE BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE ON OUR CAMPUS AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGE OF THIS BOND. IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO SUPPORT AND I I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE [inaudible] SENATE BILL. YES I BELIEVE THAT WE OUGHT TO RETAIN OUR STATUS -- SAW A TOP NOTCH PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT. IS TO KEEP OUR BUILDINGS UP HE AND REPAIR AND REHABILITATION AND ALSO EXPAND. THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING POPULATION A CALIFORNIA AND ARE GROWING ECONOMY RIGHT NOW -- IN MY AREAS SILICON VALLEY -- THEY CANNOT FIND ENOUGH TRAIN PEOPLE TO WORK IN THE HIGH TECH INDUSTRY IF THAT CONTINUES LONG TERM. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM IN TERMS OF KEEPING THOSE COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO PART OF IT IS TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND. OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE SYSTEM. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT HAVING A GOOD PUBLIC UNIVERSE IN COLLEGE SYSTEM. WITH -- SUFFICIENT BUILDINGS TO TO TRADE EDUCATE. OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IS ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF PROVIDING IS MUCH OPPORTUNITY AS WE CAN THE PEOPLE THAT DESERVE. AND AND SHOULD BE GOING TO OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE A SHORTAGE OF OF SPACE AND A SHORTAGE OF CLASSROOMS -- PROFESSORS -- AT OUR UNIVERSITY COLLEGE WE NEED TO EXPAND THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA IF WE DON'T PASS BONDS TO REPAIR. OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WE'RE NOT GOING TO EXPAND WORK ON A CONTRACT OUR SYSTEM AS THE BUILDINGS -- START TO DETERIORATE -- AND FALL APART AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY. THEY GOT MANY OF THE CLASSROOM BUILDINGS AS STUDENTS ARE -- AND THEY GO BACK TO THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND NINETEEN FIFTIES AND HAVEN'T BEEN -- REPAIRED THE SETS AND THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED AND AND REHABILITATED SO I I'M URGES STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS -- BOND MEASURE AND I THINK IT WILL HELP THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND A HELP OR ARE COLLEGE BOUND STUDENTS THAT NEED TO HAVE. A SLOT IN THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CENTERS I'VE BEEN ASKED -- TO PLEASE ASK YOU TO KEEP THE VOLUME DOWN IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT NOISIER IF YOU COULD TAKEIT. TO THE BACK OF THE ROOM THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SAID I RISE IN SUPPORT. IT IS A MATTER OF PRIORITY NOW HISTORICALLY. HIGHER END AND K. TWELVE BONDS. WE'RE PREFERRED AND THEY WERE THE ONES THAT PASSED. THE ONES THAT WERE MOST RELATED. OVER DECADES MANY MANY OTHER NEEDS AND DEMANDS. WERE EFFECTED THROUGH BOUGHT THE CREATED. THE PROBLEM THE THE CENTER FOR MORTGAGE COUNTY SO. WELL ARTICULATED WE HAVE A PROBLEM. IS DEVELOPED AGAIN OVER DECADES. BUT I WOULD LOOK FORWARD. SOME OF THAT NEEDS TO BE UNWOUND. AND WE CANNOT KEEP PASSING BONDS BUT AS WE DO SO. WE SHOULD DO SO WITH PRUDENCE AND PRIORITY. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THESE HIGHER READ BONDS [inaudible] ARE INDEED. A PRIORITY. TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION. THAT'STHE ISSUE. AND YOU SEE. SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES ARE VERY SPECIAL. IN THAT THEY HAVE RETAINED STRUCTURES. FROM ALMOST THE INCEPTION. THE TEACHERS COLLEGE. THE BRICK BUILDINGS. I THINK PARTICULARLY OF KEEP GOING FRESNO STATE THAT ARE DEAR TO ME. THEY ARE STILL FUNCTIONAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE MAINTAIN THEM AND READ THE MILITATED THEM MADE THEM WORSE QUAKE SAFE. BUT IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR OUR STUDENTS. THE QUALITY OF FACILITIES. A REALLY INTEGRAL. AND WE CANNOT. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO DO MUCH. WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE BOND. I REMEMBER THE CHANCELLOR OF UC DAVIS HAVING DINNER WITH ME ONE NIGHT [inaudible] COMMENTING. ABOUT MY ASSISTANCE HERE. GETTING THE MONEY. FOR WHAT BECAME MYERS HALL AT UC DAVIS. HE TOLD ME TO MY SURPRISE AND I GUESS I JUST HAD NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR MAJOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT FUNDED. IN TEN YEARS. I BRING THAT UP TO NOTE THAT THE NEGLECT OF THESE RESOURCES. IS LONG LONG TERM IT'S BEEN AROUND. FOR MANY ANY YEARS THAT WE HAVE DEFERRED [inaudible] MAINTENANCE [inaudible] AND CONSTRUCTION. OF NEW FACILITIES. I LIKE TO SHOOT THE RETENTION OF THE OLD HISTORIC FACILITIES BUT WE NEED. AND THIS IS. A PRIORITY I WOULD ARGUE I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTER GLAZIER YOU MAKING CLOTHES THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR TO THE MEMBERS FOR LISTENING FOR THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED. BY THIS DISCUSSION TODAY. CERTAINLY -- THANKS TO MY JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA -- APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT IN THE JOINT AUTHORSHIP FROM THE SENATOR FROM -- FRESNO AND STAND AS A LOS ANGELES TO HIM -- BUT I WOULD SAY THIS THAT -- TO THE SENATOR OF THE ALUMNI SENATOR FROM LONG BEACH OF I WOULD SAY THIS THAT FIRST -- YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BALANCE SHEET AT THE STATE ARE OF COURSE -- IMPORTANCE AND AND REQUIRE OUR OUR CONSTANT ATTENTION AND DIGITAL AND SAID I AND YOU KNOW AND WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO MANAGE BETTER AND YOU KNOW I'M VERY COMMITTED TO THAT -- BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EDUCATION THAT YOU'VE GOT TO ENJOY IN EXPERIENCE AT LONG BEACH. THOSE BUILDINGS DIDN'T JUST APPEAR ON THE DAY IN WHICH YOU WERE IN ROLES. THEY APPEARED BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- OUR ANCESTORS OUR FOREFATHERS IN FOR MOTHER'S MADE A CHOICE TO INVEST IN THOSE FACILITIES AND THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN BY. TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE THE TREE IN THE BACKYARD IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF A BONDS AND INVESTMENTS THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO MAKE IT PAY OFF. OVER MANY MANY DECADES. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BUT THEY DIDN'T JUST HAPPENED YESTERDAY. MANY OF THEM BEGAN IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. MANY OF THEM WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE NINETEEN EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WE CELEBRATE THAT BUT IS THE SENATOR FROM TO HIM THAT. MADE QUITE CLEAR. SOME OF THEM ARE ALMOST IN ORIGINAL FORM FROM WHICH THEY WERE BUILT THAT BACK IN THOSE TIMES. SO WE BENEFITTED BECAUSE OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS INVESTED IN THOSE FACILITIES AND THEY WERE THERE FOR US. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT'S BEING ASKED OF US TODAY IF WE DO NOT INVEST. IN THOSE FACILITIES FOR OUR STUDENTS. TODAY TOMORROW AND INTO THE FUTURE WHAT WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM. WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM. AND I KNOW PART OF THAT ANSWER. AND THAT'S IT THAT TUITION IS GOING TO GO UP FEES ARE GOING TO GO UP AND THE BIRDS THAT USED TO BE BORNE BY ALL OF US AS A STATE. BECAUSE OF THE VALUE OF THAT ARE UNIVERSITIES BRING TO THE STATE ARE NOW GOING TO BE BORNE BY OUR OUR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES OR NOT AT ALL. AND WE KNOW THE DETERIORATION THAT WILL LEAD. TO SO WHEN THE QUESTION COMES UP WHAT WILL THIS COST AND WHAT WILL BE NEED TO BE CUT -- I THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICES THAT WE MAKE. AS A LEGISLATURE. IT'S ABOUT THE VALUES AND HOW WE PLACE THEM WITHIN OUR FUNDING SYSTEMS. AND I KNOW FOR ME AND FOR MANY THE INVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR THE STUDENTS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW -- IS A HECK OF A GOOD INVESTMENT AND AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR HOW WE GO FORWARD INVESTING THE PRECIOUS TAXPAYERS MONEY THAT WE ARE IN POWER TO OVERSEE. THERE ARE THIRTY THREE UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS MEASURE. ALL ACROSS OUR GREAT STATE FROM SAN DIEGO ALL THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

ONE SEVENTY ONE THIS IS A BILL TO FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH DATA. BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS WITH A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE SUBMIT A PAY DATA REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE TO COMPENSATION OR TO OUTLINE THE COMPENSATION AND HOURS. OF WORK TO OF ITS EMPLOYEES BY GENDER RACE ETHNICITY IN JOB CATEGORY. A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO RECOGNIZING THE PAY DISCRIMINATION IS HARD TO DETECT AND ADDRESS. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A REVISION TO A LONG STANDING DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO SUBMIT FOR A PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS. THIS IS CALLED THE EMPLOYER INFORMATION REPORT OR THE EEOC. ONE IT IS NOW A BASED UPON THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THE FORM IS REQUIRED OR EXPANDED TO SIMPLY INCLUDE THE REPORTING A PAY DATA. BY RACE AND GENDER BEGINNING IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PUT A HALT TO THIS NEW RULE. AND IN MARCH OF THIS PAST YEAR FOLLOWING A LAWSUIT BY THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER IN OTHERS THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT. HAS ORDERED THE ADMINISTRATION TO COLLECT THIS DATA BY SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. THIS MEASURE SB ONE SEVENTY ONE ENSURES THAT OUR STATE CIVIL RIGHTS AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WILL ALSO RECEIVE THAT IMPORTANT QUE IN JOB DADDY INFORMATION. THAT WHEN PLAYERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN PAY IN HIRING PRACTICES FOR A SELF EVALUATION AND CORRECTION PROCESS THIS MAY INFORMATION IS NOT. GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC IT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE SO THAT COMPANIES CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR. AND SEE WHETHER THEY'RE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT MANY COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT COMPLYING DON'T REALIZE THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING. THAT'S PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO TAKE A LOOK TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT. THEY ARE DISCRIMINATING FREQUENTLY ON KNOWINGLY BUT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT TEY ARE OR ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW. THIS BILL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO ENSURE THE DATA WILL NOT BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS I MENTIONED. EVEN TO A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING THIS BILL IS ABOUT HAVING COMPANIES LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THEY ARE IN FACT COMPLYING WITH EXISTING LAW. THIS IS PART OF A CONTINUING AN ON GOING STEP WE HAVE TO DO TO FIGHT THE WAGE GAP. AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IF WE CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT PACE IT WILL TAKE UNTIL TWENTY FIFTY NINE FOR WOMEN IN THE U. S. TO FINALLY REACH PAY EQUALITY THIS MEASURE. IN IS DESIGNED TO HELP COMPANIES MEET THE LAW IT'S A MEASURE THAT I BELIEVE WILL GIVE COMPANIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT IT WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ADVERSE ACTIONS. IT'S A MEASURE OF WHOSE TIME HAS COME AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM SEEING NONE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN.

PLEASE READ SENATE BILL ONE SEVENTY TWO BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AN ACT RELATED FARMS. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE SAID TO BRING THAT TO PRESENT SB. ONE SEVENTY TWO WHICH HAS SEVERAL -- MOVING FACTORS WITHIN THE BILL ALL RELATED TO INSURING FIRE ARMS ARE PROPERLY LOW LOCKED AND STORED BOTH IN RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND THEY ALSO IN RESIDENTIAL -- SENIOR FACILITIES IMPROPER STORAGE OF FIREARMS IN THE HOMES FRANKLY ARE KILLING TEENAGERS KILLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACCIDENTAL FIREARM DEATHS SUICIDE AND SENSELESS ACTS OF VIOLENCE AMONG CHILDREN ARE RELATED TO EASY ACCESS TO FIREARMS. EXPANDING ON CHILD ACCESS PREVENTION LAWS WILL LOWER RATES OF UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. SB ONE SEVEN TWO WHAT AUTHORIZED THE TEMPORARY TRANSFER OF A FIREARM WITHOUT A FIREARMS DEALERS PARTICIPATION TO A PERSON WHO IS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF OLDER. FOR SAFEKEEPING TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE. IT ALSO MAKES THE CURRENT CRIME OF CRIMINAL STORAGE APPLICABLES THE STORAGE OF AN UNLOADED AS WELL AS LOADED FIREARM. THE BILL WOULD PLACE ON A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION LIST PERSONS CONVICTED OF THIS CRIME WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM OWNING A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION. FOR TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF CONVICTION CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME TO KEEP A HANDGUN WITHIN A PREMISE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHILD OR PERSON PROHIBITED PROFESSING PROBE. POSSESSING A FIREARM IS LIKELY TO GAIN ACCESS IF THE CHILD ARE PROHIBITED PERSON ATTAINS ACCESS. TO A HANDGUN AND CARRIES IT OFF PREMISES AT B. ONE SEVEN TWO WOULD MAKE THIS CRIME AFTER A COUPLE TO ALL TYPES OF FIREARMS AND PUT THIS CRIME ON THE TEN YEAR LAST. CURRENT LAW MAKES IT A CRIME FOR AN OWNER OR LEGAL ARGUMENT OF A RESIDENTS TO STORE FIREARM. THAT. THE RESIDENT IN THAT RESIDENTS IF THE PERSON KNOWS ANOTHER PERSON RESIDING IN THAT RESIDENTS IS PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING A FIREARM UNLESS THE FIREARM IS SECURED. THIS BILL WOULD PUT THAT CRIME ALSO ON THE TEN YOUR TEN YEAR PROBATION LESS SO THE KEEP OUR SENIOR SAY FACT -- WHICH IS ASO PART OF THIS REQUIRES REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR A FIREARM AND AMMUNITION TO BE CENTRALLY STORED IN A LOCK GUN SAFE. WITHIN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES THINK ABOUT THAT ISSUE RIGHT NOW OUR OUR SENIORS GOING TO THESE CARE FACILITIES AND THERE'S NO STANDARD THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THERE'S NO. DISCLOSURE ON FIREARMS AND ENTER THOSE FACILITIES THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE FACILITY TO PREPARE AND MAINTAIN AN IN A WEAPONS INVENTORY FOR EACH FIREARM AND TYPE OF ANY MINUTE AMMUNITION. STORED AGAIN WE'RE NOT TAKING SOMEONE'S RIGHT AWAY. BUT CERTAINLY THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE SENIOR FACILITIES SHOULD KNOW WHAT COMES IN IN THE SHOE BOX WHEN GRANDMA AND GRANDPA SHOW UP SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SENATOR NIELSEN. PRESERVATION OF THE SENATE. THIS IS ANOTHER. PILE ON BILL [inaudible] RELATED [inaudible] TO GUNS. THE PROBLEMS OF GUNS ARE NOT. SENIOR CITIZENS WHO STORE THEM IN WHATEVER MANNER. OR EVEN FAMILIES.

JUST AS ALL OF THE OTHER GUN CONTROL BILLS [inaudible] FLOW THROUGH. THEY LAUGHED AT CONSCIENTIOUS PARENTS [inaudible] OR CITIZENS. WHO HAVE GUNS? DO TAKE. THE PRECAUTIONS [inaudible] THE STORE. AND PROPERLY PROTECT THOSE GUNS. IN PART BECAUSE THEIR FAMILY HEIRLOOMS AND TREASURES. WE HAVE SOME IN OUR GUN SAFE. THEY'RE VERY SPECIAL. BUT WE ARE NOT WORRIED. ABOUT THEM BEING USED. FOR INFORMACIóN PURPOSES. AGAIN. DO I WANT TO CALL IT JUST A COSMETIC FEEL GOOD BILL. NO I DID NOT GO SO FAR I HAVE FAR TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. IT IS SINCERE INTENT IN THE THOROUGHNESS WITH WHICH HE PUSHES ALL LEGISLATION. I JUST THE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING NOT NECESSARY. AND I AM CERTAIN. FIVE YEARS HENCE. TEN YEARS HENCE.

UNFORTUNATELY CHILDREN SOMETIMES PERISH IN THOSE ACCIDENTS -- THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. TO SAY WERE SERIOUS ABOUT KEEPING GUNS AWAY FROM THOSE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM WHETHER THAT SOMEBODY ON THE PROHIBITION LIST OR A YOUNG PERSON AND AGAIN THE SENIOR FACILITIES -- PIECE OF REGULATION.

NOW THE LEGISLATURE'S TRYING TO WIND EVEN THAT. NOT JUST THE CHIU POSSESSED. BUT YOU USED. WELL THAT'S NO BIG DEAL. BUT THIS IS. A BIG DEAL. FROM THE SUBLIME. TO THE ABSURD I ORIGINAL VOTE [inaudible] CENTER STONE. THANK YOU ADAM -- PRESIDENT I CERTAINLY ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH MY MY FELLOW SENATOR FROM TO HANNAH. I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION SB ONE TWENTY OF THOSE BILL MAY BE A POLITICAL STATEMENT HAS GREAT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR MANY CALENDAR CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL ADDS A CONCEALMENT IN OPEN CARRY OF A HANDGUN IN A PUBLIC PLACE TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT MISDEMEANORS THAT WOULD IMPOSE A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION. FOR POSSESSION OF OWNERSHIP OF A GUN UPON THE CONVICTION THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF FIREARMS PROHIBITION ON MISDEMEANORS WAS THE TEMPORARILY PROHIBIT INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMITTED ACTS OF WERE VIOLENT IN NATURE. ORG CLEAR MISUSE OF A FIREARM HOWEVER. MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE CONTINUOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO WRONGLY EXPAND THIS LIST TO INCLUDE CRIMES THAT ARE NEITHER UNINTENTIONAL THAT ARE EITHER UNINTENTIONAL MISTAKES OR DID NOT INCLUDE ANY ELEMENTS. OF VIOLENCE IT'S VIOLATING OPEN CARRY LAWS WHICH ARE VERY COMPLEX IN NATURE WORTHY OF A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION. IS HAVING A CONCEALED WEAPON IS A FORMER FREE SPEECH EXPRESSION OR MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE.

FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT ABSOLUTISTS BUT WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A MODEST BUT IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE WITH THEIR GUNS BUT THAT THOSE WHO FLAUNT THE LAW OPENLY. WHETHER A VIOLENT CRIMINAL OR SOMEONE WHO USES THEIR WEAPON. AS SOME KIND OF STATEMENTS. THAT'S THE POLITICAL STATEMENT HERE. IT'S NOT FROM THIS BILL. IT'S THOSE WHO TREAT OUR LAWS. IN A WAY THAT IS SOME KIND OF POLITICAL THEATER AND IN FACT LIVES ARE AT STAKE. COMMITTEES -- RISK.

THAT ARE PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THE COOPERATION. IS SO VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE COMMUNICATION IS KEY. THE SAVING LIVES. THE IN THESE SITUATIONS THE SLOW [inaudible] BRAINERD THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE SAFETY WOULD BE SYMPATHETIC WITH THIS LEGISLATION. WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN INTERRUPTION. AND WHEN FOLKS THAT ARE NOT NOTIFIED OR CANNOT. THEMSELVES TO NOTIFY THEY AND WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM. AND AS THESE DISASTER SITUATIONS SEEM TO BE. INCREASING. ALL THE MORE NEED. FOR US TO HAVE THAT RAPID TRACK. I WANT TO THANK SOME OF THE PROVIDERS THOUGH. SOMETIMES MAYBE CRITICIZED. AND I DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK AT THIS BILL IS A CRITICIZED AS A MOTHER. BUT IN THESE RECENT DISASTERS HOW VERY HELPFUL THEY HAVE BEEN. SOME OF THEM WILL. LITERALLY [inaudible] BUILT CITIES. IN THE AREA WHERE WE HAVE HAD FIRE DISASTERS. WHO WERE THERE A LONG TIME? IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. THOUGH THAT'S NOT THE POINT THAT WAS A POINT ABOUT GOOD FAITH AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP. BUT GOOD COOPERATION. I THINK IS EASILY DONE. IT SAVES LIVES IT'S SAFE PROPERTY. I REGION I VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SEVENTY ONE APPLIED TO THE AUTHOR. THE SET GOOD SENATOR FROM HILLS BURKE FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. I MET WITH -- SOME. FRIENDS OF CONSTITUENTS -- IN MY OFFICE -- YESTERDAY.

HOW FAST THAT FIRE WAS WORKING? TOWARDS OUR HOUSE. ELEVEN FORTY FIVE THE THE MRS WALKER HUSBAND I'M A SAID I SMELL SMOKE.

WE NOT BE TALKING ABOUT -- A FIRE THAT WAS -- CLOSE TO A COMMUNITY BUT WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT THE DEATHS OF TWO TO THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE TIME WITH THE EXISTING -- TECHNOLOGIES TO GET OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITIES IN TIME.

AT THE TIME JOINTLY AUTHORED BY MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES FROM THE AREA ASSEMBLY WOMAN CATHERINE. BAKER AND AND THIS MEASURE CURRENTLY CO AUTHORED BY THE THE THE NEW ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM THE AREA. BUT THIS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF PARK AND RACK. TO SELL A PORTION OF THE CARNEGIE STATE. CREATION VEHICLE AREA KNOWN AS ALAMEDA TESLA -- FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES IF. THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES IT'S IN THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A PLAN TO EXPAND THE CARNEGIE. OFF ROAD -- AREA WAS APPROVED BUT IT LED TO BROAD LOCAL OPPOSITION. THE PROJECTS CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION -- THAT INCLUDES THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA A CHALLENGING -- THE EXPANSION. A LARGE DELEGATION OF BAY AREA CAUCUS MEMBERS AND I HAVE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER SELLING THIS EXPANSION AREA. RECOUPING THE MONEY BACK INTO THE OFF ROAD FIND -- BECAUSE IT IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THIS PROJECT CAN BE MIRED IN CONTROVERSY FOR A VERY VERY. LONG TIME WHEN WE ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER THIS THEIR ANSWER WAS THAT THEY NEEDED LEGISLATION TO MAKE THAT OPTION. EVEN AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT THE MEASURE IS BEFORE YOU TODAY DOESN'T MANDATE A SALE OF THE PROPERTY. I SIMPLY SAYS THAT IF IN THEIR WISDOM THEY DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO KEEP FIGHTING THE LAWSUITS.

WOULD YOU TAKE IT OFF THE QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED AS A PART OF THE SALE OF THIS I UNDERSTAND A NEEDS TO GO TO A NONPROFIT WHICH IS -- NOBLE -- WILL THAT PROCESS BE CLOSE BID OR AN OPEN NEGOTIATION TO SELL THAT PROPERTY. CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION THE IF THAT IF THE CHOICE WAS MADE. TO SELL THE PROPERTY WOULD FALL INTO THE SAME SURPLUS LAND POLICIES THAT WE HAVE AN ACTIVE FOR OUR ENTIRE STATE. AND THERE'S A PROP PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DO THAT THAT'S NOT AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. OKAY SO -- NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT PROCESS ARE YOU AWARE THAT THAT WOULD BE A CLOSE BID PROCESS. I'M NOT I'M NOT DIRECTLY FAMILIAR WITH EXACTLY HOW THAT AT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNDERTAKES THAT. UPSET THAT -- ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL IS THAT -- THAT THE PROPERTY NOT BE SOLD FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN IT WHAT IT COSTS TO PURCHASE. SO THAT THE FINE WOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO ITS SAID CURRENTLY -- THAT THE POSITION WAS IN WHEN THEY WHEN THEY PURCHASED THE PROPERTY SO WE DO SET A FLOOR IN LEGISLATION THAT HE CAN'T GO BELOW -- WHAT IF THEY PAY FOR IT ORIGINALLY AS TO HOW HIGH AND WHAT THAT THE BIDDING PROCESS I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT OKAY THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME AT A PRESIDENT ICE PERCENT -- I UNDERSTAND THE THE CONTENTIOUSNESS OF OF A SITE.

TO USE THESE VEHICLES WHICH IS A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE GOING TO GO IN PLACES WHERE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO RECREATION HABITAT IN SENSITIVE AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SELLING THIS PROPERTY BUT I THINK IT'S APPRECIATED PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS IT WAS USED BY FEES COLLECTED FROM ALWAYS FOR YEARS WHICH IS BASICALLY.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES -- HIGH -- PROUDLY RISE IN SUPPORT AND AND AUTHORSHIP OF SB SEVEN JUST A LITTLE BILL THAT IS RESOLVED THE SIXTY YEAR. DISTRICT ISSUE RELATIVE TO THE PROPOSED ONCE SURFER SEVEN TEN FREEWAY -- NOW -- THEN PROPOSED TO BE A SUBTERRANEAN -- TUNNEL AS YOU KNOW -- METRO OF LAST YEAR -- CHOSE A PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE WHICH WAS TO WORK WITH LOCAL CITIES ON LOCAL TRAFFIC MITIGATION INSTEAD OF PURSUING THE TUNNEL THAT WAS ALSO -- THE SENTIMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THAT WAS ISSUED -- THIS YEAR -- DECLARING THE LOCAL ALTERNATIVE -- SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS HAS THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE -- THIS WAS WELCOME NEWS TO FOLKS -- THROUGHOUT THE CORD OR THIS BILL CODIFIES THAT DECISION -- AND ONCE AND FOR ALL BRINGS CLOSURE FORMAL CLOSURE. TO THE SEVEN TEN ISSUE I CAN TELL YOU -- THIS PAST WEEKEND I WAS AT AN EVENT IN THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA WHERE SEVERAL OF THE COMMUNITIES WERE REPRESENTED WHO WERE TRADITIONALLY ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. ALL CELEBRATING A SICK LEVY EVENTS SO -- I KNOW FOR A LONG TIME FREEWAY SUPPORTERS -- THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR HEAD HANGING DOWN BUT MOST OF THE FOLKS IN THE REGION HAVE MOVED ON LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR LEADERSHIP OF SUPERVISOR KATHERINE BARKER -- HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO THE PROCESS THE BILL ALSO DOES A FEW OTHER THINGS THERE'S BEEN LONG STANDING NON PROFITS IN THE REGION. THAT -- WANT TO PURCHASE THEIR PROPERTIES -- RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE BEING ONE BOTANICAL GARDENS BE ANOTHER -- LOCAL SCHOOL IN THIS BILL HELPS FACILITATE THOSE LONG STANDING NON PROFITS TO PURCHASE THEIR HOMES AND THEN FINALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS MANY OF THE RENTER'S HER -- FOR WHO ARE IN THE AFFORDABLE RENT PROGRAM ARE FACING A RENT INCREASE BY CALTRANS IN THIS BILL FREEZES THOSE RENTS FOR THOSE RUNNERS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSE IT'S EXTENDS. THE RENT FREEZE FOR THOSE HOMES IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UP. TIME FOR EVERY PROUD TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT VERY PROUD OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT A MASK QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WHAT DO YOU ENTERTAIN A QUESTION? YES I WILL. YOU'RE RECOMMENDING THAT WE NOT INCREASE [inaudible] THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE RENTS. AND TELL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU SAID IT WAS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT WOULDN'T. WHAT IN SOME KIND OF COLA BE APPROPRIATE OVER THIS LENGTH OF TIME? SO THE GOOD QUESTION -- SO THERE ARE CURRENTLY RANCHERS IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING RIGHT PROGRAM -- IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF THE RANCHERS THE OTHER MANAGER PAYING MARKET RATE AND THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING. RAIN INCREASES BUT THIS SMALL PORTION OF EXTREMELY LOW INCOME. RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT TENANTS FOR DECADES WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS AND HOPE TO PURCHASE THOSE HOMES JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I FRANKLY I'D LOVE TO FREEZE THE REIGN OF ALL OF THE TENANTS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL IN THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING THE HOMES. BUT YOU CAN JUSTIFY IN MY OPINION THOSE SMALL GROUP OF HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE IN THE FOUR DOUBLE RENT PROGRAM GIVING THEM THAT RENT RELEASE OR RELIEF -- IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF MOST OF THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE SOLD ANYWAY. AND SO IT'S OUR DESIRE TO OF BUT THE SUNSET EXTENSION BEYOND THE POINT OF TIME A WE THINK ALL OF THESE HOMES WERE OVER TO PRIVATE. HANDS SO WE THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. SPLITTING OF THE ISSUE FOLKS WHO QUALIFY FOR MARKET RATE. ARE GOING TO GET THE INCREASES FOLKS OVER IN THE AFFORDABLE -- RENTER'S PROGRAM AREN'T WE THINK IT'S A IT'S A DIGNIFIED WAY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU [inaudible] RESIDENT. SHARE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE [inaudible] CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU -- I JUST WANT TO THANK OUR MR THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP IT IS IN MY DISTRICT AND WE'VE HAD. VERY LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND I YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE THAT -- HIS BILL WILL HELP WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE'RE GIVING ANYTHING AWAY IT BEING THAT THESE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN. SORT OF STRUGGLING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GONNA BE DISPLAYS AND THEY TOOK THAT UPON THEMSELVES TO LIVE IN A CORRIDOR WHERE WE KEPT THREATENING TO TO EXPAND THE FREEWAY AND SO I WANT TO THANK THEM BECAUSE IT DEFINITELY HELPS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND SECONDLY WE'RE DEFINITELY TAKING CARE OF A LOT OF THE CITIES THAT ARE GONNA BE IMPACT TED DOWN THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE MONIES IN TERMS OF TO HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE THE TRAFFIC ISSUES AND SELL. I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THAT AND WITH THAT I ALSO -- TONIGHT THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER DEBATE. SENATOR PORTANTINO YOU MAY CONCLUDE.

WAS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A HOUSING ELEMENT THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD HAVE MET UNDER TRADITIONAL RULES RUNNING MODIFIED RULES BEEN PROPOSED THE HOUSING ELEMENT. BUT THE THING THAT WE DID IN IN GETTING THAT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TCC GRANT FROM THE TRANSFORMATIVE I MEAN FROM THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WAS PROMOTE WAS PUT TOGETHER A PLAN.

ICE THIRTY TWO KNOWS TO THE MEASURE PASSES. MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER. SIXTY EIGHT SB FIFTY SIX SENATOR ROBB PLEASE READ SENATE BILL FIFTY SIX BY SENATOR ROTH AND ACTOR LINDA POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES -- IT'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA'S SUPPLY OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT IS CONSIDERED ADEQUATE TO MEET PATIENT NEEDS. THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION IS EVEN MORE DIRE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL. WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS FAR FEWER THAN THE RECOMMENDED RANGE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS. WE STARTED YOU SEE OURS FOR YOUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE YOU DID AND THE SCHOOL OPENED IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND WHEN IT OPENED. HE WAS THE FIRST NEW PUBLIC MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THIS STATE AND MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. SINCE ITS OPENING THE SCHOOL MEDICINES GRADUATED EIGHTY NINE STUDENTS WITH DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREES FORTY IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FORTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN HOWEVER DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE TIME IT WAS ESTABLISHED. USE YOUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WAS FORCED OCCUPY EXISTING FACILITY LOCATED ON THE CAMPUS WHICH IS LIMITED ITS TOTAL ENROLLMENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS. AND THE STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL TO FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS PER FISCAL YEAR IMPACTING ITS ABILITY. TO FULLY REALIZE ITS PUBLIC MISSION EXPANSION OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FACILITY IS URGENTLY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE. FIVE HUNDRED PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS BILL SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW USE YOUR SCHOOL OF MEDICINE FACILITY WITH SOMEONE GOING FUNDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUDGET I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] ENTER STONE. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO THANK MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- MANY OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS BUT WE WERE TRYING TO GET THE UC OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL OFF THE GROUND FOR YEARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE COULDN'T GET. THIS LEGISLATURE TO AUTHORIZE THE FUNDS I WAS ON THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AT THE TIME IN. IT WAS -- PROPOSED TO US IF WE CAME UP WITH TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS -- AS A COUNTY BOARD -- THAT LEGISLATION WOULD BE GRANTED TO GET THIS NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL OFF THE GROUND. I AM VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT IN THE STATE FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR COMMITMENT AND LOVE TH UC OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL TO COME TO FRUITION. PRIOR TO THAT THE UC HAD A PROGRAM OF THE UCLA WERE YOU COULD DO TWO YEARS OF PRE MED THAT -- YOU SEE ARE IN BE GUARANTEED A SPOT AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP. OUR SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY WHICH IS ONE OF THE LOWEST POSITIONS TO PATIENT RATIOS PROBABLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A DRAMATICALLY NEEDED EXPENDITURE WE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS NOT ONLY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE FUNDS WILL ALLOW THE MEDICAL SCHOOL TO EXPAND. TO HAVE LARGER FACILITIES SO THAT WE CAN TRAIN AND EDUCATE MORE FUTURE DOCTORS. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT OLD PEOPLE LIKE ME. PART OF THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION AND THERE'S A LOT OF DOCTORS IN THAT GENERATION THAT ARE GOING TO BEGIN TO RETIRE. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE COMPETENT GOOD DOCTORS TO TAKE CARE OF US OLD FOLKS AND WE GET TO THE AGE WHERE WE NEED MORE INTENSIVE MEDICAL SERVICES. THIS IS GOOD FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY THIS IS GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PLUG MY CAR MIKE MY FELLOW -- SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND URGE A STRONG I VOTE FOR SB. FIFTY SIX HUNDRED GALGIANI. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY FIRST TERM IN THE ASSEMBLY IN 200-072-0008 WE WERE TRYING TO BRING A SCHOOL OF MEDICINE NOT ON LEAD TO UC RIVERSIDE BUT ALSO TO UC MERCED. BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WE WOULD HAVE A SHORTAGE OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PHYSICIANS AND FORTUNATELY THAT'S WHEN THAT HOUSING CRISIS HIT FOLLOWED BY THE BUDGET CRISIS. AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE HOPE TO PLAN FOR THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THIS FELL BY THE WAYSIDE BECAUSE WE WERE JUST TRYING TO COBBLE ENOUGH MONEY TOGETHER AND THE STATE'S BUDGET TO GET BY. THIS IS LONG OVERDUE I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT ADDING WHAT WE NEED FOR YOU SEE MERCED TO MEDICAL SCHOOL IN ADDITION BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO REMIND. MEMBERS AGAIN A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PHYSICIANS SHORTAGE BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO AND AND WE'RE LONG OVERDUE FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT -- TO EXTEND MY APPRECIATION TO THESE TEAMS SENATOR FROM -- RIVERSIDE -- OF COURSE I INDICATED EARLIER THAT BELIEVE THERE WAS A CLERICAL ERROR. IN -- YOUR BILL IT SHOULD BE YOU SEE FRESNO. MEDICAL PROGRAM. BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF OF BRINGING TO FRUITION -- MORE ADVANCED MEDICAL EDUCATION NOT JUST TO RIVERSIDE COURSE WILL BE SUPPORT OF TODAY BUT ALSO CREATING PARTNERSHIPS WITH YOU. IN TANDEM WITH WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE IN THE VALLEY YOU KNOW I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE THOSE WHO ARE IN A POSITION -- TO TO HEAR THE MESSAGE THAT -- CENTER GALGIANI HAD ON INDICATOR EARLIER WE HAVE A DESPERATE NEED -- FOR MEDICAL TRAINING ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN IT AND OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIA SO I HOPE IN TANDEM WE CAN -- FIND THE THE FINANCING AND THE POLITICAL WILL TO BRING ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN DECADES DOT IN THE NEED -- SO WITH THAT I AM THANKFUL FOR YOUR EFFORTS I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO WORK IN TANDEM -- TO ACHIEVE MEDICAL -- INDICATION IN BOTH OUR RESPECTIVE AREAS SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- SB FIFTY SIX PROVIDES FOR ME A LITTLE BIT OF A CONUNDRUM -- I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THIS BILL -- THAT IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED REQUIRES REQUIRES THE CONSTRUCTION. OF A NEW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE IN RIVERSIDE [inaudible] SO I LIKE TO KNOW HOW THAT'S DONE. BECAUSE I SUBMITTED A BILL TO TRY AND ADD A COUPLE LANES. TO A COUPLE OF OUR HIGHWAYS WHICH WOULD HELP COMMUTERS AND TRAVELERS AND GOODS TRANSPORTATION MOVERS AND I WAS TOLD HEY YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO CONFUSE. THE CTC THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION GRIP THE RESHUFFLE THEIR ALL THAT. AND WHAT YOU THINKING AND AND AND SO I YOU I FIND THIS. VERY INTERESTING I WAS JUST KIND OF SURPRISED TO FORGIVE ME FOR MY CONFUSION MADAM PRESIDENT BUT THE THE TERM DESPERATE NEED WAS USED IN A WE HAVE A LOT OF DESPERATE NEEDS. AND THE HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE HOW DO WE SHUFFLE THE DECK. AND SO I'M. A LITTLE CONFUSED BECAUSE WE NEED TO UNCLOG MAJOR ARTERIAL HIGHWAYS. AND I I I JUST WILL HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE AND HAVE HIM TUTOR ME -- BUT I HOPE THIS BILL IS SUCCESSFUL. AND I HOPE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY PUT HIS NAME ON IT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] CAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS -- IT TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM RIVERSIDE FOR BEING AFFORD I DO NOT REPRESENT RIVERSIDE FACT I REPRESENT. SACRAMENTO WHICH IS A LONG WAY FROM RIVERSIDE. BUT I KNOW THAT THIS INSTITUTION IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT -- TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF OUR MEDICAL COMMUNITY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHILE CERTAINLY I IT THE THE SUPPORTED APPRECIATE -- THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IN COMMUNITIES -- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE -- I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE REASON WE NEED A MEDICAL SCHOOL AND EXPANSION THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL IS THAT ACTUALLY -- COMMUNITIES ALSO NEED AND I'M A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SO I'M ALL FOR PRIMARY CARE -- WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE THAT THIS COMMITTEES HAVE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE AND AND AND SO THAT THE PRESENCE OF THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL IN RIVER SITES NOT JUST ENOUGH TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN THE LA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR SPECIALTY CARE. IT'S GOING TO BE AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL THE OTHER PART IS IS THAT. WHILE THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL CERTAINLY HAS BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB. SO FAR IT ACTUALLY -- THESE EXPANSION BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY ISN'T QUITE OPERATING A SCALE WITH -- SO THERE'S A CERTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED FOR MEDICAL SCHOOL -- TO BE BE ABLE TO BRING IT TO SCALE IS GONNA BE SOMETHING I SHE'S A VERY COST EFFECTIVE USE OF FUNDS -- FOR US AGAIN BUILD THAT CAPACITY IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE A RESEARCH CENTER IS A MEDICAL SCHOOLS WELL SO THE DISHES ESPECIALLY CARE IN FACT WE NEED RESEARCH TAKING PLACE IN COMMUNITIES LIKE. A RIVER SIDE AS WELL -- BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE SURE% THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT INVESTIGATING WHAT IS CUT -- DRIVING -- ABOUT HEALTH AND DISEASE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THIS IS A GOOD IDEA -- BUT CERTAINLY IS A PHYSICIAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT THIS IS THIS -- THE THIS MEDICAL SCHOOL DO -- FOR THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE AIR TONIGHT THANK YOU. SIX FURTHER DISCUSSION ARE AT SENATOR DR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- ONE OF THE IN THE HEARING WE HAD ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST ABOUT THE PRESENTATION THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE MADE -- AND THE OTHERS WAS A COMMITMENT. TO DIVERSITY. IN THE TRAINING OF OUR FUTURE OF PHYSICIANS -- AND THERE WAS A PARTICULAR WITNESS THAT SPOKE A A YOUNG -- GENTLEMAN BUT LET THE IN THE WHOLE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE PASSION OF GOING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND BEING A DOCTOR IN HIS COMMUNITY SO -- THAT WAS THAT STOOD OUT. BY -- THE SENATOR AND ALSO BY IS WITNESSES SO ON TOP OF ALL THE OTHER REASONS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT STOOD OUT TO ME AND ONE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] SENATOR JACKSON'S. IT'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I TO RISE IN SUPPORT BUT IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A SCHOOL AVAILABLE. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE THE STUDENTS. AND THE COST OF A MEDICAL EDUCATION TODAY I WOULD SUBMIT HAS PROBABLY DISCOURAGED A LOT OF OUR YOUNGEST AND BRIGHTEST. FROM ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS I THINK IF WE TRULY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CORRECTING SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS WE HAVE. PRIMARILY IN RURAL BUT IN URBAN AREAS AS WELL AS WAS NOTED BY. MY A GOOD TO THE GOOD SENATOR AND BABY BOOM COLLEAGUE OF MINE FROM TO MACULA A LOT OF PHYSICIANS WHO ACTUALLY BENEFITTED FROM SO MANY OF THE PROGRAMS. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFFERED BACK OF THE THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO THE RICH THE COST OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION BEING. LITERALLY AFFORDABLE THEN AND CERTAINLY NOT AFFORDABLE TODAY WE HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF THAT QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE HOPEFULLY A NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT BECAUSE IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO GET THAT DEGREE THAN TO GO ON AND DO AN INTERNSHIP AND RESIDENCY AND THEN FINALLY STARTED PRACTICE. AND OF COURSE IF WE WANT PEOPLE PRACTICING IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP PEOPLE MORE THAN THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS. AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE IN AND OF ITSELF WE HAVE TO DO MORE AS A STATE AS A COMMUNITY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO I AGAIN WANT TO COMMEND THE OFFER FOR FIRST PLACE HIS PERSISTENCE. BUTI THINK IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE MAKING IT MORE DIVERSE MAKING IT MORE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE. WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO INVEST IN THESE PEOPLE -- SO THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT OF TIME AS WELL AS NOW THE EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EDUCATION AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE SENATOR HUESO. THANK YOU I WANT TO THETHANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING ACCESS -- TO EDUCATION IN THE AREA OF OF OF OF HEALTH CARE AND YOU KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL OF SIGNATURES TO TO FUNDING THE STUDY. AND SO IT'S IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT AS AS PROCESSES UNFOLDED THIS THIS UNIVERSITY IS TAKING SHAPE STICKING FOR OLD BEEN CREATED AND WERE EXPANDED. I YOU KNOW THIS IS A FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS OUR EASTERN MOST IN TERMS OF LOCATION THE EASTERN MOST -- MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WHERE WE SITUATE THE SCHOOLS AND ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT HAVE. OF A LACK OF ACCESS TO TWO DOCTORS WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS IN STATE BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SHORTAGE OF CULTURALLY COMPETENT DOCTORS IN THE STATE. AND RIVERSIDE IS GOING TO PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT LOCATION FOR PEOPLE IN THAT PART OF THE STATE TO ACCESS -- A QUALITY MEDICAL SCHOOL. MY DISTRICT IS VERY CLOS TO THIS DISTRICT IN THE A YOU KNOW IT WHEN I GOT ELECTED SENATOR EVER PRESENT AT THE THE COACHELLA VALLEY AND AND THE IMPERIAL COUNTIES TO REPRESENT PER COUNTY. BUT HAVING ACCESS TO YOUR RIVERSIDE GENERALLY PEOPLE OF THAT COME FROM MY DISTRICT ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF OF RIVERSIDE IF THEY'RE GONNA GO TO COLLEGE. AND NOW THEY HAVE A MEDICAL SCHOOL TO ATTEND AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET MORE. OF OF MY CONSTITUENTS IN TO THE SCHOOL AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET MORE OF THESE STUDENTS. IN CHIU SURVEY IN THE THE AREAS THAT HAVE AN AXE A LACK OF ACCESS TO QUALITY. OF MEDICAL CARE AND WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME BRINGING THESE DOCTORS TO TO MY DISTRICT SOME OPEN. THAT THIS WOULD HELP BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS COMMIT MIXING THIS PROJECT THROUGH AND I'M GLAD THE THE THE UNIVERSITY IS ESTABLISHED NOW THE SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED. AND AND THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE THIS INVESTMENT NOT ALL THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE THANK A PRESENT FOR LAN WE MAKE THESE COMMENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO.

A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER IN TODAY'S WORLD BUT SB SIXTY ONE LOOKS TO KEEP FIREARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF LAWFUL CITIZENS INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER THE REAL PROBLEM. LIKE I TAKE ELATED THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GOING AFTER PEOPLE THAT ARE BAD PEOPLE THE DO HAVE GUNS. THE REAL PROBLEM TODAY'S WORLD IS THAT TOO MANY CRIMINALS HAVE ACCESS TO FIREARMS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DONE UNLESS AN ADEQUATE JOB OF KEEPING FARMS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS DESPITE THIS LEGISLATURE. GIVING THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO DO SO. BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN LESS THAN STELLAR IN FACT I WOULD CALL IT. A FILLING. LET'S CONSIDER WHAT IT MEANS WHEN A CRIMINAL GETS HIS OR HER HANDS ON A WEAPON A GUN. YEAH MANY OF OUR GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS IN THE STATE HAVE. LOST THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT US FROM GUN VIOLENCE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN TWO OFFICERS ONE WHO JUST STARTED HER FAMILY. AND HAD A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER. FROM THE HAMMOND AREA IN MY DISTRICT. AN OFFICER THAT WAS ABOUT READY TO RETIRE. IN THE CITY OF PALM SPRINGS. WERE SHOT AND KILLED AFTER BEING SPRAYED WITH BULLETS FROM AN A. R. [inaudible] FIFTY UNFORTUNATELY. EVEN THOUGH THE COURTS FOUND HIM GUILTY [inaudible] THE PERPETRATOR. NOT FIRST DEGREE MURDER. AND HE WILL BE CONSIDERED. A CANDIDATE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR COMMITTING THIS HEINOUS [inaudible] HERBAL CRIME [inaudible] THIS GOVERNOR. WILL REFUSE TO SIGN THE AFFIDAVIT NECESSARY. TO GIVE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT TO GIVE THIS GENTLEMAN THE DEATH PENALTY. FOR HIS DASTARDLY DEED. BAD PEOPLE GET THEIR HANDS ON DANGEROUS. GUNS ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL GUNS. DO AWFUL THINGS THIS BILL WON'T FIX THAT [inaudible] ONE BED. THERE ARE OVER. ONE HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED GUN CONTROL LAWS I THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I EXPECT THAT WE WILL PROBABLY SEE MORE. THERE'S NO REASON THAT ONE MORE LAW WILL DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF BAD PEOPLE WHO DON'T FOLLOW ANY OF THE CURRENT LAWS MEANT TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THEIR HANDS. WE NEED TO FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IS THAT A CONTINUING TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO FIREARMS. THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND IT WILL NOT PREVENT BACKERS FOR ME ILLEGALLY OBTAINING FIREARMS WITH WHICH TO COMMIT. HORRIBLE CRIMES. WITH THOSE COMMENTS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NO VOTE ON SB. SIXTY ONE SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER PORTANTINO YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS-- OF THE 260-006-0080 TWO GUNS USED IN CRIMES THAT WERE ENTERED IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SYSTEM. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WERE LONG GUNS -- OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS CALIFORNIANS HAVE TYPICALLY PURCHASE MORE LONG GUNS AND HAND GUNS AND FRANKLY THESE BULK PURCHASES OF THESE WEAPONS -- GO FROM A LAW ABIDING CITIZENS HANDS INTO. NON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS HANDS THROUGH THESE BULK PURCHASES -- YOU KNOW CALL ME CRAZY BUT YOU GOT ONE FINGER. CAN ONLY FIRE ONE OF THE TIME.

ONE THIRTY NINE SENATOR ALLEN. PLEASE READ SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY NUMBER SENATOR ALLEN AND ACT REALLY INTO ELECTIONS. MEMBERS -- WE ALL. OUR ELECTED FROM DISTRICTS THAT ARE DRAWN UP BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONS -- THEY HAVE A MORE FAIR NONPARTISAN SYSTEM THAT NOW. GETS A SELECTED. AND I I THINK IT'S SERVICE STAY WELL -- THOSE PLACES WHERE THE POLITICIANS DRAW THEIR OWN LINES. OF TIMES BE VERY SELF SERVING -- AND I OFTENTIMES CAN LEAD TO MAJOR BATTLES BETWEEN COLLEAGUES IT WAS INTERESTING BEING AT A CONFERENCE WAS TALKING TO ME. BECAUSE SOME OTHER STATES ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE -- THAT'S THE BUT WE DO FOR STATE ASSEMBLY SENATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS WE HAVE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED COMMISSIONS. AND THIS BILL EXTENDS THAT TO OUR COUNTIES -- SPECIFICALLY THOSE COUNTIES WITH MORE THAN TWO FIFTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS ARE FOR THOSE COUNTIES BETWEEN TWO FIFTY AND SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND ODD IT'S IS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. AND FOR THOSE LARGER THAN. SEVEN FIFTY THOUSAND IN RESIDENTS ARE THEY WILL BE REIMBURSED BY THE REGULAR PROCESS FOR THE COMMISSION ON STATE MANDATES. THERE ARE SOME LOCALITIES THAT HAVEFAIR TRANSPARENT REGISTERING PROCESSES BUT THERE -- WE DO SEE GERRYMANDERING CONTINUING IN SOME JURISDICTIONS -- IN IN IN IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS INCUMBENTS HAVE USE THE LOCAL LINE DRYING PROCESS TO DISENFRANCHISED. ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT GROUPS BOB REDUCE VOTING POWER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS. AND EVEN TROPICAL OPPONENTS OUT OF THE DISTRICT THEY WERE PLANNING ON RUNNING IT. ARE THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED PRIOR BILLS A REQUIRE LESS ANDERSON CDA GO TO ADOPT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS ON NOW IT'S TIME. TO REQUIRE THE OTHER LARGE COUNTIES TO DO THE SAME. I REQUIRES INDEPENDENT DISTRICT COMMISSION HAVE THE FULL POWER TO DRAFTING DOT MAPS INDEPENDENT THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- BUT THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF MEASURES IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMISSION MEMBERS OR POLITICALLY DEPENDENT AS POLITELY FARE -- THAT EIGHT A AND IT ENDED IN A PROHIBITS GERRYMANDERING AT CENTER AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THE GOOD GOVERNMENT GROUPS COMMON CAUSE WITH WOMEN VOTERS -- IT SECTOR HAVE COME ON IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT DAHLE [inaudible] SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU -- META PRESENT I RISE IN THE SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WE PASS THE CONGRESS PASSED. ARE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. IT WAS IN MANY RESPECTS A HOLLOW DOCUMENT. IN EIGHTY IN. IT IS ENCOMPASSED A VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE BUT IT TOOK MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF DOZENS OF CASES. AROUND THE COUNTRY TO DEAL WITH COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST IN ALL THE VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS TO UNDERSTAND ARMED HOW THIS PROCESS OF VOTING AND REDISTRICTING WORKS WE SEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. DESIGNATE CERTAIN COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY HAD CHALLENGES IN THE LIKE. WE HAVE FIVE TIMES IT TOOK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT REDISTRICTING. AND I SUPPORTED THAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A DAY APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW OF COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AND THE LIKE TO AVOID A LOT OF THE SHENANIGANS THAT OCCURRED. YEAH A BEFORE AND STILL IS OCCURRING IN OTHER STATES. ARMED AND AT THE CORE OF IT IS. CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE HEAR AMONG THOSE WHO WE REPRESENT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN GERRYMANDERING SELFDEALING? AS POLITICIANS WHICH THEN CREATE OUTCOMES THE DON'T REFLECT REPRESENTATION OF THE VOTERS. AND WHAT THE WHAT THIS COMMISSION IS DONE AT THE STATE HAS AND MY JUDGMENT CREATED A GREAT BODY BECAUSE ALL OF US HERE TODAY OR AS A RESULT OF THAT REDISTRICTING. AND I THINK YOU KNOW YOU HEARD ALL THE TIME BEFORE THIS ISSUE OF REGISTRY OF GERRYMANDERING AND IT'S GONE. AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ENJOY A GREATER LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IS A LEGISLATIVE BODY IS BECAUSE THOSE KINDS OF ARGUMENTS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. SO IF YOU BALANCE ON THE ONE HAND THE CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT A BALANCE ON ON ON WHICH IS SO ESSENTIAL FOR ALL OF US TO DO OUR WORK AND TO THE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE. DEVELOPED IN THE COURTS OF THE LAST FIFTY YEARS I I THINK THAT THIS SYSTEM WORKS WELL. IT IS IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A CHALLENGE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE COUNTY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PARTISAN LIKE WE ARE HERE THEY'RE ALL WE ARE PART OF A REFORM MOVEMENT TO HIRAM JOHNSON WAS TO ELIMINATE -- PARTISANSHIP OF THE COUNTIES BUT I THINK THEY'RE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF PROTECTIONS. TIME IS NOW AND I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD HI -- JOY VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR MOORLACH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. HER AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE. TRYING TO BE ADDRESSED WITH COLLEAGUES. THE AUTHOR OF SB ONE THIRTY NINE HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN GETTING TO BILLS APPROVED RECENTLY. ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEY PROVIDED OPTIONAL [inaudible] FRAMEWORKS. PROVIDED FOR REDISTRICTING COMMITTEES. I EVEN VOTED FOR BOTH OF THOSE BILLS. BUT THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CENSUS. WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IF THOSE TWO BILLS. WHERE APPROPRIATE HELPFUL? IN. RESOLVE THE CONCERNS THAT ARE. WORRIED ABOUT SO COLLEAGUES WITH WITH THE SENATE BILL ONE THREE NINE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO JYJ PROBLEMS. THE FIRST IS THAT SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SB ELEVEN OH EIGHT IN SB. TEN TWENTY EIGHT WE HAVEN'T HAD A CENSUS. SO WE WE NEED TO SEE IF THAT WORKS FIRST AND IF IT DOESN'T THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE COME BACK. WITH SB ONE THIRTY NINE AND CRAM DOWN. THIS NOT OPTIONAL REDISTRICTING COMMISSION SCHEME ON COUNTIES. WITH POPULATIONS OVER A CERTAIN ARBITRARY AMOUNT. AND IMPOSE THE PREFERRED APPROACH BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE IN SACRAMENTO WERE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN THOSE THAT LIVE IN COUNTIES OF SAY TEN MILLION PLUS PLEASE. THE CONSTANT ATTACKS NUMBER TWO ON LOCAL CONTROL IS TOO MUCH AND THIS IS THE SECOND YOUR LAW. SO LET COUNTIES TEST RIVE THE TWO GOOD BILLS ELEVEN OO EIGHT AND TEN TWENTY EIGHT FIRST. AND THEN LET'S MAKE TWO WEEKS AFTER AND THEN WE CAN IMPOSE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATOR DASCHLE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JOIN WITH OTHER MEMBERS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO PUT -- YOU KNOW ONE SIZE FITS ALL REQUIREMENTS ON OUR STATE AYE I DO FIND MYSELF -- MOVED BY THE THE THOUGHTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ABOUT TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AND HOW THAT SO FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL THAT WE DO. I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR FIVE IF I MAY. SENATOR ALLEN. YOU MAY PROCEED SO THE THE EAGLES ARE ADMIRABLE -- AND THAT'S TO CREATE THIS FAIRNESS STANDARD CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY YOU FOR YOUR LIMóN IT -- TO COUNTIES THAT ARE OVER -- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND RATHER THAN HAVING APPLIED TO EVERYONE EQUALLY. YEAH SO THE ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS IT HAD EVERYTHING TO HAVE COST WHEN THE BILL FIRST -- CAME FORWARD WE DID NOT HAVE THIS PROVISION THAT WAS PUSHED INTO THE BILL BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF FINANCE COMMITTEE -- THAT MADE THE COUNTY BETWEEN TEN FIFTY THOUSAND SEVENTY THOUSAND SUBJECT TO CORPORATION -- YOU KNOW I SO IT'S A THE INITIAL IDEA WAS THAT FOUR SMALL COUNTIES -- IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT HIT TO THEIR BUDGET -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SMALLER BUDGETS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OF HAVING AN INDEPENDENT DISTRICT COMMISSION THAT WAS SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER PROCESSES. SO THAT WAS YOU THAT WAS THE THAT WAS THE THOUGHT BEHIND THAT -- IT WAS A IT WAS A COST ISSUE OKAY. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER THAT ON MY OWN TIME -- I WOULD SAY THAT A LOT OF THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN THIS BUILDING AND IN OUR STATE WE CAN ALWAYS DO IT ONCE AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS AN INCREMENTALISM. THAT COMES INTO OUR WORK WHERE WE YOU KNOW HAVE TO LIVE MOVE THINGS IN A SLOWER PACE BUT IF THIS IS IT THE STANDARD IS FAIRNESS. BUT I THINK THAT -- THE AUTHOR IN HIS GOOD WORK AND AND WE AS A AS THE ULTIMATE GOVERNING BODY SHOULD THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT SMALL COUNTIES LARGE COUNTIES THAT WE TREAT THEM THE SAME. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT EXAMINATION AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD OR AND A SUBSEQUENT YEAR BUT I KNOW THAT THE INTENTIONS HERE GOOD ONCE AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAKE INCLUDE. YEAH I'VE I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION I I CERTAINLY DO -- SHARE MY MY FRIEND FROM ORANGE COUNTY I I WILL SAY THAT -- IN THE END OF THE DAY -- ITS LOCAL FOLKS ON THE GROUND. WE NEED THROUGH A LOCALLY DRIVEN PROCESS WHERE THE BOARD WOULD HAVE A ROLE ACTUALLY THAT WILL BE DRAWN THE LINE IS NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S NOT PEOPLE SACRAMENTO DRAWING THE LINES IT'S PEOPLE LOCAL TO THAT COUNTY TO THAT AREA WHO'D BE ENGAGED IN THE IN THE LINE DRY SO IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE THERE THIS IS NOT A IT'S SACRAMENTO TAKING OVER THAT PROCESS. BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS ENSURE. THAT THE THE MOST SELF INTERESTED THE FOLKS. TO WHO. WHO BENEFIT OR LOSE -- BASED ON THE WAY THE LINES ARE DRAWN ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY DRAW THE LINES THEMSELVES. THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. AND WE LIVE WITH HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE -- THAT IN OUR LARGE COUNTIES WE DO THE SAME TO INSURE FAIRNESS IT THEY WILL BE LOCALLY DRAWN -- BUT BUT INDEPENDENTLY DRAWN.

SEVENTY FOUR SB ONE SIX THREE SENATOR PORTANTINO PLEASE READ SENATE BILL ONE SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AND ACKLEY AND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. FOR YEARS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND SENATORS. SB ONE SIXTY THREE WILL ELIMINATE SIGNIFICAN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS. THAT ARE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. RESEARCH HAS CLEARLY SHOWN THE CHILDREN WITH ASD. WHO RECEIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT EARLY CAN SHOW REMARKABLE PROGRESS THIS BILL ALSO CODIFIES REQUIREMENTS OF A QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND POWER PER PARA? PROFESSIONAL STATISTICS TELL US THAT ONE IN FIFTY NINE CHILDREN BORN TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM. EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY TO HELPING THESE CHILDREN LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL. AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT AND NEEDS NOT ALL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE THE SAME. SAY THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY -- CHILDREN NEED TREATMENTS TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. EIGHT YEARS AGO SB NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THIS HOUSE AND PASSED THE LEGISLATURE. TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM. IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM RECEIVING ITS BENEFITS BECAUSE OF WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A DRAFTING ERROR. AN ARTIFICIAL BARRIER -- NOT EVERY CHILD IS RECEIVING THE COVERAGE FOR TREATMENT THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PRESCRIBES MANY FAMILIES ARE. HAVING TO GO OUTSIDE AND PAY FOR THIS PRIVATELY WHEN THEY EVEN WHEN THEIR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES IT. THIS IS COVERAGE THAT THEY ARE AND THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE PAID FOR BUT TOO MANY CASES THE PARENTS ARE LEFT TO COVER THE COSTS ON THEIR OWN. ADDITIONALLY FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE IS A SIX TO TWELVE MONTH MATING PERIOD. A WAITING PERIOD FOR THE ONE TREATMENT THAT HEALTH INSURANCE COVERS TREATMENT THE LATEST TREATMENT TONIGHT AND THESE YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO GET THAT TREATMENT AS SOON IN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS AS THEY CAN. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRE. ADDRESSES ROAD BLOCKS THE COVERAGE -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR SB ONE SIXTY THREE TO GET AN AYE VOTE IT'S GOOD FOR KIDS AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THANK YOU [inaudible] THUNDERSTONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE THE PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS WHEN I WENT INTO -- THE HEALTH HEARING AND THE GOOD SENATOR FROM PASADENA. I WAS GOING TO PRESENT THIS BILL -- I WAS ACTUALLY OPPOSED -- BUT AFTER HEARING HIS TESTIMONY. AND IN DURING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT. MY SON. HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH WITH HIS SIX YEAR OLD AUTISTIC DAUGHTER -- THIS BILL STRONGLY RESONATED WITH ME. NONE OF US UNLESS YOU. HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE AUTISTIC CAN UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT COME ALONG. WITH THIS DISORDER. NOT ONLY IS IT CHALLENGING FOR A MOTHER AND A FATHER TO DEAL WITH AN AUTISTIC CHILD. BUT THE BILL'S THE MEDICAL BILLS CAN BE. ALMOST COST PROHIBITIVE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL SPECIALISTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF VERY WELL TRAINED PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. IN HELPING THESE KIDS -- DO BETTER. I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY SIX YEAR OLD [inaudible] GRANDDAUGHTER LUKA. HAS BEEN NON VERBAL. FOR SIX YEARS AND SHE GETS INTENSE THERAPY. FROM SOME OF THE PROVIDERS. THAT THE GOOD SENATOR IS SAYING SHOULD BE COVERED BY INSURANCE AND I'M VERY. HAPPY TO TELL YOU [inaudible] THAT MY PAPA ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT [inaudible] WHICH BROUGHT ME TO TEARS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE FIRST TIME HE'S EVER DRESSED ME. AS MY FIRST BORN GRANDCHILD SO. THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF THE THERAPY THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY. FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES JUSTIN ON NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT HELPFUL. NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERAPEUTIC. IT IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FALL WITHIN THEIR GUIDELINES. WHICH IS TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. SO THIS BILL THAT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM PASADENA HAS BROUGHT FORWARD. IT'S GOING TO ALLOW FOR A MUCH EARLIER INTERVENTION AND THERAPIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE GIVEN OR NOT AFFORDED. AND HOPEFULLY ALLOW SOME OF THESE KIDS. ONE OUT OF FORTY ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE COMING. DIAGNOSED WITH THIS. THIS ILLNESS ON THE SPECTRUM HOPEFULLY WILL GIVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE. AT BECOMING HAPPY PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AND AGAIN I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR BRING IT FORWARD. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU DAHLE VOTE YES ON SB ONE SIXTY THREE IN MEMORY OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER LUKA WHO'S DOING VERY WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE -- CENTER PORTANTINO YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT -- TO COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO MACULA -- WHO -- REALLY TOOK A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AND AND SHARED HIS PERSONAL STORY WHICH ADDED BOTH -- HIS SCIENCE BACKGROUND AND HIS PERSONAL STORY. TO A DEBATE WHERE THERE IS OPPOSITION AGAINST THIS BILL AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M GONNA COMPLIMENT MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO JUST GAVE ME A GOOD IDEA AND I'M HOPING MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO MAKE IT WAS OPEN MAYBE WE SHOULD. MEMORIALIZE THIS BILL IN COLLEGE LUCAS LAW AND SO MAYBE WE'LL TAKETHAT AMENDMENT IN THE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY SO -- CHILDREN NEED CARE INSURANCE SHOULD PAY FOR IT.

ITEM NUMBER SEVENTY FIVE SB TWO HUNDRED CENTER MONEY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED A SENATOR MONNING ACTUALLY IN A WATER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON -- IT'S MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO RISE ONCE AGAIN IN SUPPORT OF OUR PURSUIT. OF A CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER SOLUTION. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM -- TO REVIEW BRIEFLY. CLOSE TO A MILLION CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE. THE RIGHT TO TURN ON THE TAP AND DRINK THE WATER FAITH WITH THE WATER OR COOK WITH THE WATER. THIS IS SPREAD. AROUND ABOUT THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY PEOPLE SAY WELL THIS IS A CENTRAL VALLEY PROBLEM RIGHT. YES IT'S A PROBLEM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S A PROBLEM IN THE SALINAS VALLEY THE PA HOW TO A VALLEY. THE NORTHERN BORDER BY OREGON SAN DIEGO COUNTY. INLAND EMPIRE -- THERE'S NO ONE COUNTY OR DISTRICT THAT HAS A CLAIM AN EXCLUSIVE CLAIM. ON ON SAFE. CONTAMINATED WATER THE SOURCES OF CONTAMINANTS RANGE FROM SOME AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS BUT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE MINORITY OF POLLUTANTS. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE NATURALLY OCCURRING ARSENIC CHROME AND CHROMIUM SIX URANIUM LEAD. THE PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER RECOGNIZING A HUMAN RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. BUT THE SOLUTION HAS EVADED S.. I BELIEVE UNTIL NOW. WE HAVE A STARTING WITH GOVERNOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP AND PRIORITIZING THIS ISSUE -- PICKED UP BY GOVERNOR NEW SOME WE HAVE. HIS STATED INTENT. TO FIND A SOLUTION THIS YEAR. WE HAVE THE SAME EXPRESSION FROM THE SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY. AND NOW WE HAVE THE PRO TEM OF THE SENATE PRIORITIZING THIS AS AN ISSUE. FOR OUR STATE SENATE FOR OUR STATE LEGISLATURE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM PROUD TO PRESENT SB TWO HUNDRED WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. IN THE STATE TREASURY. UNDER. THE DIRECTION OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. YOU CAN READ IN THE BILL THE DIFFERENT PROVISIONS OF SETTING UP THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS AND THE FUNDING MECHANISM -- TO MANAGE FUNDS THAT COME IN THERE. SB. TWO HUNDRED DOES NOT INCLUDE A TAX OF FEE OR FUNDING MECHANISM BUT RATHER LOOKS TO A BUDGET ALLOCATION. A RECURRING ALLOCATION OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT OF COURSE TO THE BUDGET -- NEGOTIATIONS AMONG OUR HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THIS BILL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY ESTABLISHES THE VEHICLE TO SET UP THIS MECHANISM. ONCE AND FOR ALL TO GET PEOPLE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN THIS STATE. MEMBERS I KNOW THIS IS A SHARED OBJECTIVE I BELIEVE SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED MOVES US FORWARD AS A UNITED SENATE BODY. TO PARTICIPATE WITH VIGOR IN UPCOMING NEGOTIATIONS TO ONCE AND FOR ALL DELIVER THE PROMISE TO THE COMMUNITIES MANY OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY OF TURNING ON THEIR TAP. LIKE SO MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED. TO DRINK CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER MEMBERS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR BRIDGES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I'D LIKE TO POSE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE OFFER. IF POSSIBLE WOULD YOU EXPECT A QUESTION YES THANK YOU YOU MAY PROCEED. I THANK YOU ARE -- FOR BRING THIS ITEM YOU AND I HAVE HAD -- A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A FUNDING SOURCE. I GIVEN THE DRAMATIC NEEDS THAT WE HAVE A IN THESTATE AND OF COURSE I ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE COMING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ONE OF THE ISSUES -- THAT I WANT TO JUST GET CLARIFICATION ON THIS IS EVOLVED OVER TIME INITIALLY THERE WOULD THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- A SERIES OF INDUSTRY RELATED TAXES WHETHER BE ON CUSTOMERS ARE DAIRY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. THAT HAS SINCE EVOLVED. IN TWO NOW WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THIS IS NOT A TAX THIS IS A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. THAT IS CORRECT ALL RIGHT HERE'S HERE'S MY MY MY LASTING A RESERVATION [inaudible] IS. ARE WE EXPECTING THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OR SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. FOR THAT GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION TO BE OFFSET BY SOME OTHER FORM OF TAX THAT WOULD BE USED TO FUND IT. THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. SHOULD THAT HAPPEN IN THE PROCESS OF NEGOTIATIONS. SENATE BILL. TWO HUNDRED WOULD COME BACK TO THIS BODY. IF IT WERE THE VEHICLE THAT WERE AMENDED AND WE'D HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT. IN RE VOTE ON AN AMENDED BILL WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY IS A VEHICLE THAT IS EXPLICIT. IN INDICATING THAT THIS WOULD BE FUNDED BY A BUDGET ALLOCATION OF A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. PER YEAR RECURRING ALLOCATION I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL YOUR QUESTION IS A FAIR. ONE I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT MIGHT OF ALL OF BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. IS TO ESTABLISH THE APPARATUS. IMPLEMENT A FUNDED SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FUND OKAY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THAT -- I THINK YOU CAN SENSE MY ANXIETY -- ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT HITS HOME SO SO GREATLY -- I WAS -- INITIALLY SUPPORTIVE OF BUT THE SENATOR FROM THE ANOTHER CENTER FROM THE VALLEY'S -- PROPOSAL PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT WASN'T A TAX IN NOW THAT YOURS IS IN THAT SITUATION AS WELL THIS MAKES IT FAR MORE APPEALING. BUT I CANNOT OVERSTATE. AND ASK UPON -- ASK YOUR YOUR EMPLOYER PLAN YOUR GOOD NATURE TO FOR ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATIONS BUT THIS IS NOT A TROJAN HORSE THAT WE'LL. ARE EVOLVE INTO SOMETHING UNRECOGNIZABLE. AND COME BACK AND AND GO AGAINST THE CONCERNS LOOK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I CAN'T STAND HERE AND GIVE YOU MY WORD WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. IN NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT'S NOT MY ROLE MY ROLE IS TO GET A MECHANISM THAT WE CAN FIND. A BUDGET ALLOCATED RECURRING BUDGET ALLOCATION TO FUNDS THIS THAT'S WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US IF IT GETS CHANGED IT HAS TO COME BACK. AS AS OPERATION OF LAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT GIVES ME A LOT MORE -- ON A CONFIDENCE AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR INCREASE SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW -- WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR MANY YEARS TRYING TO RE FRAME IN A NUMBER OF CONTACTS WATER POLICY -- AND WE HAVE IGNORED SOME OF THE UNDERLYING. SOCIAL SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES DEALING WITH WATER QUALITY WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB I THINK IN DEALING WITH SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. TRYING TO MITIGATE THE AMOUNT OF WATER TRANSFERS WITH IT WAS IN THE COLORADO RIVER OR FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CHECK MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO GO MAGICALLY REDUCING THE WATER CONSUMPTION BY PASSING A SERIES OF CONSUMPTION BILLS CHECK DON WHERE DID DIESEL OUR RESERVATION WERE WORKING IN THAT FIELD AND WE'RE WORKING ON STORM WATER AND WATER RECYCLING. BUT THE BIG HOLE THE BIG EQUITABLE HOLE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED -- IN THESE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE IN VERY ELOQUENT WAY AND TREMENDOUS HARD WORK BY THE CENTER FOR MODERATE. WHAT HE IS DONE AND HOW YOU STRUCTURED THIS THE KIND OF COALITION IT'S BEEN BILLED? TO TO TO SUPPORT THIS THE IN EQUITY MENTIONED THE THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND WORKING IN THE SEWER ISSUES AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES. THAT ARE PART OF THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE OF THIS ISSUE BUT NOTHING HITS IT IS SQUARE. AS THIS MEASURE BEFORE US I THINK IT IS BRILLIANT I GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THE AUTHOR FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY WORK THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS PUT IN. THE WORK ON THIS MEASURE AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS ALL I'VE NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF SB TWO HUNDRED AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE TWO COMMITTEES THAT I MONO VIA MAIL QUALITY. IN APPROPRIATIONS BUT TODAY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM CARMEL MONTEREY -- FOR HIS LAB PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE ARE SO I AM PREPARED TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT RIGHTFULLY USES GENERAL FUND. DOLLARS NOT A WATER TAX AS THE FUNDING SOURCE. I THINK SENATE THE SENATOR HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NEED TO FIX THE WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND I THINK WE'RE ALL CERTAINLY IN SYNC WITH OUT -- BUT THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF THAT'S IN THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL THOROUGHLY GOES A LONG WAY -- TOWARDS DOING JUST THAT. I AM PLEASED THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE A TAX ON WATER AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT -- THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ARE NOW IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO HUNDRED FOR THE SAME REASON -- WITH THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS I CERTAINLY ASKREN AYE VOTE AND SB. TWO HUNDRED SENATOR HEARING TINA. THANK YOU A MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO HUNDRED ALSO RISE TO TO COMPLIMENT -- THE AUTHOR FROM A MONTEREY WHOSE LIFE'S PASSION IT IS TO HELP CALIFORNIA HAVE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND SENATE LEADERSHIP AND MY COLLEAGUES. FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO OF ALL SORT OF WORKED IN CONCERT ON THIS CRAFTING THIS SENATE PLAN TO SOLVE A PROBLEM WITHOUT A TAX. AND SO OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL LEFT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE -- IN ITS CURRENT FORM BECAUSE OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE HAD DONE SUCH A GOOD JOB TO FIND RESOURCES IN THE GENERAL FUND. TO PAY FOR IT AND THE QUESTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE THE PASSION IN THE ANSWERS -- I THINK IT SAYS A LOT ABOUT THIS BODY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT AN ISSUE TO DEVELOP THE TRUST ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS BILL PROSPECTIVELY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK. FOR A VOTE IF IT HAD ANY OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE TWO THIRDS SO I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF A SAFETY I KNOW IT'S NOT THE INTENTION. TO DO ANYTHING BUT USE THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND THIS LAUDABLE PURPOSE AND AGAIN COMPLEMENT THE QUESTIONERS FOR CERTAINLY THE PASSION. OF THE AUTHOR AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR FINDING A CREATIVE SOLUTION TO SOLVE A PROBLEM USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS SCIENCE TO SEE AYE SICKLY SUPPORT SB [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT A PRESERVATION GENTLE WITH THE SENATE. MY ISSUE. IS TRUST [inaudible] NOT. IN THIS HOUSE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS HOUSE HAS TAKEN A STEADFAST. POSITION A RESPONSIBLE. POSITION. AS I SEE IT. BUT AS I LOOK AT THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROCESS. AND I LOOK AT MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OVER YEARS HERE PROTECTING IN RECENT YEARS OF AGREEMENTS ROCKED. BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES. AND ONE PARTY. HAVING KEPT AS WERE THE OTHER PARTY SAYING WELL THINGS CHANGED. THANKS CHANGE THE NEXT YEAR. THEN THAT WHICH WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE. WHICH DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES THE TIME ALL OF A SUDDEN THINGS CHANGE BUT ONLY FOR ONE PARTY. NOT FOR THE OTHER PART. THEY QUITE FRANKLY REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN DUPED. AT THEIR POLITICAL PERIL. BY PLACING AN MISPLACING THEIR TRUST. IT'S A BIG DEAL ITEM HERE THE ORGANIZATIONS. MY OWN INDUSTRY AGRICULTURE. HAS LONG HAD ITS TRUST BREACHED. END QUOTE DEALS MADE. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S. AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'M SORRY TO BE SUCH A SKEPTIC. IN A CYNIC. THAT IS NOT MY NATURE. BUT WE SEEM TO MANY OF THESE THINGS AND I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO THOUGHT. THIS WILL COME BACK IN ANY SIMILAR FORM WHAT SO EVER IF IT COMES AND IT WILL ONLY COME FOR CONCURRENCE. IN ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS. MIGHT GET REFERRED TO COMMITTEE BUT I DOUBT THAT VERY MUCH OF THE BEST YOU'RE GOING TO GET IS A SHOT AT ON THE FLOOR. I DO URGE A NO VOTE [inaudible] CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. HI DAVE PROUDLY SERVED ON THE RED FLORA NOW GOING INTO MY FIFTH YEAR. AND I CAN MAKE [inaudible] ONE IMPORTANT [inaudible] CONCLUSION. AND THAT IS -- MY MY FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM CARMEL. IN MY VIEW. IS A MAN OF HONOR. HE'S BEEN A MAN OF TRUTH. HE'S BEEN A MAN OF PASSION. AND HE'S ALWAYS KEPT HIS WORD. AND WHAT I'VE WITNESSED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THAT HE IS A MAN THAT IS THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE LESS FORTUNATE THAN HIMSELF OR US. I ALSO BELIEVE THE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER SHOULD BE A RIGHT. NOT A LUXURY. BUT A RIGHT. WE ALL KNOW. THAT WE HAVE. A BLESSED REVENUE STREAM COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TWENTY ONE BILLION IS ESTIMATED ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE. AND AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE GOING INTO OUR BUDGET HEARINGS VERY SURELY THE BUDGET. IS REALLY. A REFLECTION OF OUR PRIORITIES AND THEN. IT IS ALSO. A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES. MAKING THIS A GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. REFLECTS NOT ONLY THE VALUES I THINK OF ALL OF US ON THE RED FLOOR RED CARPET TODAY. BUT IT'S ALSO REPRESENTED OF THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT THE ALSO BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER [inaudible] TO EVERYONE. NOW TELL YOU THAT IF WE ARE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN EIGHT OR NINE WHEN WE HAD [inaudible] HISTORIC DEFICITS. AND WHILE I CAN TELL YOU I HAVEN'T VOTED FOR TAX IN TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. I CAN TELL YOU BACK THEN IF I WAS ON THE RED CARPET AND WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A TAX TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED ONE AS LONG AS A WAS A REGRESSIVE ON THE POOREST OF PEOPLE THEY WERE TRYING TO HELP. THAT IT WAS PASSED ON MAYBE SOME MORE -- HIGHER INCOME. EARNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE CASES WE CAN WELL AFFORD. THIS POCKET CHANGE IF YOU WILL. TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR THOSE REASONS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO VOTE YES ON SB [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I SERVED WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARMEL IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THOUGH WE OFTEN DISAGREED ON MANY ISSUES -- HE'S ALWAYS BEEN HONORABLE AND TRUTHFUL EVEN IF I DIDN'T LIKE TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE FULL FAITH AND CONFIDENCE THAT. IF HIS BILL GETS OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY WHERE IT STATES ON AND PAGE [inaudible] TEN SORRY. LITTLE VEIN I WANT -- GLASSES ALL THE TIME. SO I'M PAGE TEN LINE ITEM THIRTY THREE IT SAYS THIS DOES NOT IMPOSE A LEVY CHARGE EXTRACTION OF ANY KIND SUCH AS A TAX OR A FEAT. THAT LANGUAGES IN THIS BILL ON PAGE TEN LINE ITEM THIRTY THREE AND THIRTY FOUR IF THEY DECIMATED IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH SOMETIMES THEY TEND TO DO WE KNOW THAT BILL WILL COME BACK TO THIS HOUSE. AND I'M SURE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL MAKE SURE THAT AND IT IS TAKING CARE OF SO THAT THE VOTES THAT WE GIVE ON THIS SIDE. ARE NOT JEOPARDIZED I THINK THAT HE WILL HONOR HIS WORD I DON'T THINK I KNOW HE WILL HONOR HIS WORD. I KNOW THAT WITH A TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN OUR CAUCUS THERE'S GOING TO VOTE FOR A TAX INCREASE -- IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY TAXES THAT ARE PAID BY CALIFORNIANS IN 53% OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. CITY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE OF THE REGRESSIVE TAXES THAT WE HAVE. SO I HAVE TOTAL FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN THE AUTHOR WHO IS GOING TO GET THIS BILL OFFICE FLOOR. IT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY INTACT AND THEN THE DEAL IS GOING TO GO FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE RELIABLE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FIRST PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING IN OUR DISTRICT WHERE -- SOME OF THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR DISTRICT CAN'T EVEN TURN ON THEIR TAP WATER AND HAVE WATER COME OUT SO I THINK THE AUTHOR. FOR OF OF VERY. MEDIAEVAL GOOD SOLUTION CREATIVE THAT CAME TOGETHER OUT OF THIS DISCUSSION AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THIS ARE AND I AM HONORED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE ON THIS FLOOR THAT DOUBTS THE TRUSTWORTHINESS STEADFASTNESS OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CARMEL -- BUT BUT THERE IS CONCERN I JOIN WITH MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES -- IN THE SENATOR FROM FRESNO AND HAVING SOME TREPIDATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I DO TRUST THAT. SENATOR FROM CARMEL WILL DO HIS UTMOST TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL REMAINS WITHOUT THE TAX AND FEE THAT IT HAS TODAY -- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE SEND A MESSAGE NOT JUST FROM REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO FROM AT LEAST ONE DEMOCRAT AND I THINK OTHERS. THAT SHOULD THIS BILL RETURN WITH A TAX INCREASE OR FEES SUCH AS ONE FEARS THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT VOTES ON THIS FLOOR. TO TURN IT BACK -- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT [inaudible] SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I JUST -- WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM CARMEL FOR HIS -- THIS WILL TREMENDOUS WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR NOT JUST THIS BILL BUT FOR FOR MANY YEARS AND I THINK WE ALWAYS HEARD AND TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER CERTAINLY IS A PHYSICIAN AND BACKGROUND PUBLIC HEALTH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF LIKE. THE FUNDAMENTAL THING WE TALK ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY WELL. IT'S A CLEAN WATER SANITATION AND VACCINATIONS SO THERE'S A TOP ONCE AND SO I THINK I REALLY OF WANTED OF SLIDE MY GOOD FRIEND I APPRECIATE. THE FOLKS -- FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER -- I ALSO WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- THE KERR BILL AS IT CURRENTLY IS AND THAT'S WHAT WE DEBATE -- DOES NOT INCLUDE TAX OR FEE -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE AND WE AND WE'RE GONNA BE DEBATING A BUDGET LATER ON WILL -- AND LOOKING AT FUNDING THROUGH THAT MECHANISM BUT I THINK WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS IS THAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THAT OUTCOME THAT -- A GOOD FRIEND FROM CARMEL AND I HOPE ALL OF US SHARE OF BEING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER LATER TONIGHT BUT SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO HUNDRED AND IN ON AM PROUD AND LOOK FOR TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS THISITEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE BUDGET I THINK IT'S ALSO. IMPORTANT WE ALL REMEMBER THAT WE ARE A BI CAMERAL -- HOUSE DATA WE TO HAVE BILLS ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT WE HOPE OUR LEAGUES -- CAN HAVE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN THE POWER OF THE COLLECTIVE INSTITUTION TO ACT RESPONSIBLY WITH OUR LEGISLATION AS WE DO WITH THEIR SOLD THAT'S NOT A A A A BIGGER I'M GONNA POKE. IN TERMS OF MY LACK OF CONFIDENCE OF THEIR CAPACITY I I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET. I'LL BE VOTING I TODAY. THING NO FURTHER -- DEBATE. MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU -- MEN. PRESIDENT AND I WON'T BE DEBATING I YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. BUT I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARMEL I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY. THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS. I IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD THE LARGEST STATE. THAT THERE ARE RESIDENTS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS -- TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER. I IT IS JUST NOT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF AND WE ARE PROUD OF SO MUCH IN THE STATE. I'VE HEARD YOUR CONVERSATION TODAY AND THE DIALOGUE IT IS WHAT I ANTICIPATED. IT IS I THINK WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND I IT IS THE REASON WE'VE TAKEN THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE TAKEN BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS I WANT TO ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE BUDGET CHAIR. THE VICE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HAVE TAKEN THIS ISSUE ON I WANNA -- SAY AN ADDITIONAL I THANK YOU TO MY SEAT MATE AND COLLEAGUES. FOR BEING WILLING TO BE FLEXIBLE AND AND SHIFT.

BE HAVING THE CONVERSATIONS AFTER OUR BUDGET. ARE THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- IS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR WORKING CONCLUDING THAT THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSIBLE -- DIPLOMATIC CONVERSATIONS WILL BE HELD WITH OUR GOVERNOR AND OUR SPEAKER ABOUT HOW WE GET THIS DONE. FINALLY HOW WE GET THIS DONE. BUT WE CAN'T SPEAK FOR WHAT FUTURE YEARS MAY MEAN. I IN TERMS OF HOW IT MAY BE MORE FOR WE'RE HERE THIS YEAR SOME OF US WILL BE HERE NEXT YEAR. BUT REALLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS NOT POSTPONE THIS. CRITICAL ISSUE ANY FURTHER WE NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBLE ACTION AND I APPRECIATE -- THE CONVERSATION THECOMMENTS OF COLLEAGUES -- FROM BOTH OUR POLITICAL PARTIES AND PERSUASIONS IT IS HEARTENING TO SEE THAT PEOPLE REALLY ARE TRYING TO COME TO A POINT WHERE WE WORK TOGETHER.

WHO TEACH MY GRAND CHILDREN IN OAKLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND -- I JUST WANNA LET THOSE TEACHERS AROUND THE STATE NOW THAT WE HAVE THE BEST INTEREST OF STUDENTS TEACHERS AND STAFF AT HEART IS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

MEMBERS WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO WITHOUT OBJECTION WE'RE MOVING ON TO ITEM. ONE TWENTY TWO WHICH IS SB TWO ZERO SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TWO OH SIX BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO COLLEGIATE ATHLETES. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE HBO DOCUMENTARY. THAT'S A HEARING NOW ACTUALLY WILL CONTINUE TO MAY TWENTY SIX CALLED THE STUDENT ATHLETE PRODUCED BY LEBRON JAMES. THE DOCUMENTARY UNVEILS THE COMPLEX WORLD OF THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COLLEGE SPORTS ENTERPRISE. AND THE IMPACT IT IS HAVING ON UNPAID STUDENT ATHLETES AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB TWO ZERO SIX ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO CORRECT THAT DEEPLY UNFAIR AND EXPLOITATIVE SET OF RULES. IT STOPS THE ONE AND ONLY ONE CATEGORY OF STUDENTS MEETING THE RULES. FROM ANY EARNINGS BASED ON THEIR TALENTS. MUSIC MAJORS COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS ENGINEERING MAJORS ARE FREE TO USE THEIR TALENTS. AND IN INCOME NOT COLLEGE ATHLETES. SB TO THE ZERO SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR COLLEGES TO PAY ATHLETES DIRECTLY. IT'S SIMPLY AFFORDS COLLEGE ATHLETES THE SAME RIGHTS THAT OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE GIVEN AND NOTE OLYMPIC ATHLETES ARE ALSO CONSIDERED IMMATURE. SO THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL ICE OR COLLEGE ATHLETICS AND IN FACT MAY RESULT IN ENCOURAGING SOME OF OUR STUDENTS TO STAY IN SCHOOL RATHER THAN THE MOTIVATION TO GO PRO EARLY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO EARN AN INCOME. I'M JUST LIKE OLYMPIC ATHLETES SB TWO OH SIX WOULD ALLOW STUDENT ATHLETES AND CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGES -- TO MAKE EARNINGS FROM THEIR NAME IMAGE OR LIKENESS. IN COMMITTEE WE HEARD PASSIONATE TESTIMONY FROM A VOLLEYBALL PLAYER AT STANFORD. HALEY HUDSON I BRING HER UP BECAUSE I IMAGINE MANY PEOPLE ARE THINKING THIS BILL PROBABLY ONLY BENEFITS. THEN THE MEN ATHLETES MEANING THE BASKETBALL PLAYERS THE WE'VE HEARD ALMOST MORE FROM FEMALE ATHLETES. AND WHAT HALEY HARD TO DESCRIBE SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE PICK IN THE U. S. FOR VOLLEYBALL. SHE DECIDED TO ATTEND STANFORD. AND APPS STANFORD. IN PLAIN. SHE WAS INJURED. AND DUE TO THAT INJURY SHE HAD TO STOP HER ATHLETICS. NOW SHE WAS OFFERED BECAUSE SHE WAS THE NUMBER ONE FEMALE VOLLEYBALL PLAYER IN THE US SHE WAS OFFERED -- SPONSORSHIPS AND SUCH SHE COULD NOT TAKE THEM AND BE ABLE TO PLAY FOR STANFORD. AND NOW WITH HER NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO PLAY DUE TO HER INJURY SHE'S PREVENTED FROM EVER GAINING ANY OF THOSE EARNINGS THAT SHE MIGHT OF RECOUP. FROM HER ATHLETIC TALENTS NOW I GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF MISSY FRANKLIN KATIE LEDECKY BOTH OLYMPIC ATHLETES BOTH AVAILABLE TO GET SPONSORSHIPS DUE TO THEIR OLYMPIC RIGHTS. BUT BOTH WHO PLAYED FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES MISSY FRANKLIN CHOSE TO SWIM FOR CAL BERKELEY. AND SHE DECIDED TO SWIM ALL FOUR YEARS AND FOR GO HER RIGHT TO MAKE ANY MONEY FROM. WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO AS AN OLYMPIC ATHLETE. AT THE END OF HER CAL CAREER SHE INJURED HERSELF SHE IS NOW NOT BEING ABLE TO GO PRO SHE CAN MAKE NO MONEYOFF FOR TALENT. KATIE LEDECKY WHO SWAM FOR STANFORD WHAT'S THAT AND AFTER TWO YEARS OF SWIMMING FOR STANFORD QUIT THE STANFORD TEAM AND IS NOW UTILIZING HER. OLYMPIC RIGHTS TO MAKE MONEY. SO SB TWO ZERO SIX JUST ALLOWS US TO CORRECT THAT ON FEAR. IT'S GOOD FOR OUR STUDENTS IT'S GOOD FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. NOT A PRESENT LAID JEALOUS SENATE FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES HAVE GOT ALONG VERY WELL. WITHOUT GETTING PAID. BY HAVING AMATEURS. STATUS IF YOU WILL. MAYBE YOU'VE PAID SOME ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. BUT THE MORE ABLE ATHLETES. ALL SIGNING UP AGENTS. AS COLLEGE STUDENTS NOW IT WILL BEGIN TO SIGN UP AGENTS OR THEY RATHER WILL BE SIGNING UP. THE COLLEGE STUDENTS. IT'LL BE ONE OF MY BED TIME. ONE OF MY BIT. AND WHEN YOU INTERJECT. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT WILL BE ON THE MINDS OF THESE ATHLETES. AS IS ON THE MINDS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF SPORTS. THERE IS RELEASED THE BASKIN OF HOPE. IN THE SPIRIT. THE DEDICATION OF COMPETITION TO AMATEURISM. THE LIVE YET TODAY. SO WHAT NEXT. ON MARCH MOST TALENTED. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. YEAH I BET IN TEN YEARS. IT'LL COME TO PASS. I URGE. THE NOBLE [inaudible] SENATOR WELLS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO OH SIX I TYPICALLY DO NOT LIKE CALIFORNIA ONLY BILLS BUT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT CRIES OUT FOR JUSTICE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE NC DOUBLE A IS A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY ARE THE LAST FIGURE I COULD FIND FOR THE NC DOUBLE A BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT. SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY THE SUPER BOWLS THE MOST ICONIC AMERICAN SPORTING EVENT I THINK IT'S THE BASKETBLL TOURNAMENT. AND THEY MADE. SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS YET THEY HAVE THEIR STUDENT ATHLETES -- STAR. AT THE END AND NOT NOT PROPERLY CLOTHES AND AND NOT PROPERLY TAKEN CARE OF SO WITH THE TAX MATTERS IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATS OF ALL WOMEN COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYERS ARE GOING TO END UP IN THE W. NBA. AND LESS THAN 2% OF MEN -- WHETHER IT'S BASKETBALL FOOTBALL OR SOCCER PLAY AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. THE FACT OF MATTER IS THERE'S A LOT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF CORPORATE. PEOPLE. MAKING CORPORATE DOLLARS AND THEY ARE NOT SHARING THE WEALTH PROPERLY THESE STUDENT ATHLETES ARE TREATED LIKE A CHATTEL AND IT HAS TO STOP AND I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF SB [inaudible] TWO OH SIX SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE TO SUPPORT SB TWO US SIX AND COMPLEMENT THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S A BIGGER SPORTS FAN -- IN THE SENATE THAN MYSELF I LOVE COLLEGE SPORTS I REPRESENT THE ROSE BOWL -- AND HAVE BEEN MY ENTIRE LIFE FOLLOWING COLLEGE SPORTS -- AND YOU KNOW I GOT CALLS FROM ATHLETIC DIRECTORS FROM THE MAJOR PAC TEN SCHOOLS ASKING ME. TO HOLD THIS BILL IN SUSPENSE BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED THAT IT WAS GOING -- TO HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON ATHLETES BUT THE AUTHOR HAS MADE SUCH A COMPELLING CASE ON THE NEED TO BRING SOME FAIRNESS AND CLARITY AND AND JUST BRING THE THE UNDER THE TABLE CASH ASPECTS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING COLLEGE SPORTS. ON TOP OF THE TABLE -- AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THE ANTI TO A HAS ALREADY INITIATED A COMMITTEE BASED ON THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL TO LOOK AT THIS EFFORT NOW WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS NOT JUST. A AS AVERAGE **** USED TO CALL THEM A GOFFIN TO TO HIDE OUR R. I. FROM THE TRUE. PRIZE AND THE WAY TO DO THAT I THOUGHT WAS TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL FOR THREE YEARS SO THE NCTO A KNOWS THAT. THE AUTHOR ISN'T GOING AWAY THIS ISSUE AS A GOING AWAY AND IF THEY DON'T SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE CALM LAWN APPLICABLES TO STUDENT ATHLETES ON IN THE PAC TWELVE AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT IS THE PRESSURE THAT WE NEED TO PUT ON THE NC TO A TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS COMMITMENT AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR A FOR INTRODUCING IT AND BE FOR BEING WILLING TO ACCEPT. THAT DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE IT GETS TO THE SPIRIT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WHICH IS HOLD THE NC TWO EIGHT FEET. TO THE FIRE SO STUDENT ATHLETES ARE PROTECTED IN A IN A REASONABLE FAIR WAY IN OUR RIGHTS TO SUPPORT SB TWO US. SIX SENATOR BRADFORD. WE RUN OUR LIKE. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE FEAR PAID TO PLAY AN ACT -- MAJORITY OF THESE ATHLETES ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN -- MOST THE TIME MAKE UP LESS THAN 3% OF COLLEGE UNDERGRADS BUT 50% OF THE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL TEAMS. THESE MEN AND WOMEN PUT **** IN THE SEATS OF ARENAS AND STADIUMS ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THEY MAKE THE UNIVERSITY TO MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SELLING THEIR JERSEYS. THERE ARE -- OTHER FROM OP NOW YOU'RE FROM THE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE OF THERE. SUCCESS ON AND OFF THE FIELD BUT THESE ATHLETES BENEFIT NOT. ONE DIME I THINK IT'S A MATTER% SPORTS FOLKS THIS IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. THIS IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE THIS IS A BOUT PEEN OUR ALLOWING SOMEONE TO MAKE A LIVING I WENT TO COLLEGE WITH A LOT OF GUYS WHO. PLAYED SPORTS AND THEY STRUGGLED I MEAN THEY STRUGGLE. TO STAINED GLASS IN IT DESPITE HAVING A SCHOLARSHIP AND I% COULDN'T EARN EXTRA MONEY COULDN'T TAKE JOBS. DURING THE SEASONS AND THEY LOOK REALLY STRUGGLE BUT NOW YOU HAVE COLLEGE COACHES MAKING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THESE COLLEGE COACH MILLIONAIRES ARE GOING INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HOMES RECRUITING AND WITH THE PROMISE OF ALL THE WHAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS TO OFFER AND MANY TIMES. AGAIN. VERY FEW OF THESE FOLKS EVER MAKE IT TO THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL SO I THINK THEY SHOULD GET THEIR DO WHILE THEY'RE STILL PLAYING AT THESE COLLEGE THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THESE YOUNG MEN. LEAVE COLLEGE EARLY FOR FINANCIAL GAIN I THINK THIS WITH A SET OF EYES AND TO STAY AND GRADUATE BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THEM DON'T. DON'T GRADUATE AND I THINK. I WISH THIS BILL WHEN IT EVEN FURTHER I WISH YOU GUARANTEE. ANYONE WHO PLAYS COLLEGE SPORTS. A CONTINUATION OF EDUCATION AS LONG AS THEY WANT TO ONE THEY GOT UNDERGRAD DEGREE GET A MASTERS DEGREE GET A PHD I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR LIFE AT THOSE UNIVERSES WHICH THEY PAY SO. I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT AN IRISH AYE VOTE. SENATOR TO LETTER. MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF TWO OH SIX I HAD -- A QUITE A DEBATE WITH THE THE AUTHOR JUST THE OTHER DAY WE WENT BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH. AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WHY BECAUSE I HAVE A SON WHO GRADUATED FROM U. S. SEED PLAYED ON THE USC FOOTBALL TEAM. AND HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY WITH A GREAT USC PLAYERS AND HE WOULD SHARE STORIES. HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR SOME OF THESE PLAYERS AND AND HOW FORTUNATE MY SON WAS? AND I JUST HAD A GRANDDAUGHTER WHO JUST A GRADUATE FROM SYRACUSE AND SHE WAS ON THE SOFTBALL TEAM. AND SHE SHARED ALL HER OPPORTUNITIES BUT AT THE SAME TIME ALSO SHARED THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY SO I SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY OF FAIRNESS REPRESENTATION. IT WILL OPEN UP THE DOOR FOR THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN MINORITIES ESPECIALLY TO BE ABLE TO SEE REPRESENTATION NOW. SO THEY COULD CONTINUE MAYBE ON INTO THE FUTURE SO IT'S A IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY OUT FOR US TO OPEN UP THIS DOOR. FOR OPPORTUNITY AND FAIRNESS IN ATHLETICS AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING AT FORT THANK YOU I SUPPORT THE I BO [inaudible] SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT I THINK WELL ALL MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BROUGHT UP SOME SOME VERY GOOD POINTS TODAY. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT OUR OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THEIR PRIMARY TASK TO BE TO PROVIDE A QUALITY EDUCATION FOR OUR KIDS. AND SECONDARILY -- TO ALLOW THEM. TO USE THEIR WONDERFUL ATHLETIC -- SKILLS -- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT MANY OF OUR UNIVERSITIES -- DO VERY WELL WHEN THEY HAVE SOME LOCAL STARS WHETHER IN BASKETBALL FOOTBALL TRACK. WERE YOU BRINGING. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO A STADIUM IT HELPS FURTHER -- EDUCATION IN THOSE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH THIS BILL IS IT IS CALIFORNIA CENTRIC. IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A BILL MORE APPROPRIATE TO BE ENTERTAINED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE NC A A IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION THAT APPLIES TO ITS RULES TO MEMBER INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THE NC A A PROHIBITS A STUDENT ATHLETE FROM RECEIVING ANY AFTER BENEFIT. INCLUDING COMPENSATION ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR SUPPORT. THE PENALTIES TO THESE. ATHLETES COULD BE REPAYMENT OF MONEY. THE OUT A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF GAMES OR PERMANENT INELIGIBILITY. SB TWO OH SIX AS WRITTEN. WHAT PLACE? TWENTY ONE OF OUR CAMPUSES. AND THEIR STUDENT ATHLETES IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH AND SEE A A POLICIES. ON COMPENSATION MOREOVER. THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS WHO WOULD BE INELIGIBLE. TO COMPETE UNDER NC A A RULES. THIS BILL COULD RESULT IN OUR STUDENTS AND CAMPUSES BEING UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN INTERCOLLEGIATE SPORTS COMPROMISING IMPORTANT ELEMENT. OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS. THE ORGANS AGAIN MADE TODAY ARE GOOD. BUT THEY NEED TO BE UNIVERSALLY APPLIED. THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS I'M GOING TO SEE I THINK WHAT WE'LL SEE IS. AN ENHANCE COMPETITION OR FUTURE STARS. THAT COULD BE COMING AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES AND POTENTIALLY UNDERHANDED WAYS OF RECRUITING THOSE STUDENTS LOS STARTS. TO GO TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE REASONS. I THINK WE SHOULD PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AND SB TWO OH SIX AND AT THIS POINT TIMERS CAN OVER. THANK YOU SENATOR CHANGE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. FOR BRINGING AFFORD SHE ALSO MENTIONED THAT A LOT OF THE ATHLETES ARE WOMEN. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR PAY EQUITY IN WOMEN'S SOCCER? THIS IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE. YES IT WAS IF IT WAS AT MY RESOLUTION WAS A FAIRNESS ISSUE THIS IS A FAIRNESS ISSUE I URGE AND I VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR DODD. YEAH MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I HAD -- WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BILL I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS IS -- AS THE SENATORS -- FROM -- KERBER AND ALSO FROM -- TEMECULA. AND I WENT SAW THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY AND TALK THROUGH THIS ISSUE. ESSENTIALLY THIS IS NOT -- THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE WE WERE REALLY BEING PRESCRIPTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SETTING A MARKER WE'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY. THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AND WE WANT TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. AIR THEY HAVING THIS STATE. SEC FORTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE ALLOWS THE NC DOUBLE A TO DO THE JOB. THAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT FOR ALL OTHER FORTY NINE STATES IN OUR OUR GREAT UNION. I DO BELIEVE THOUGH -- THAT -- THAT DON'T YEAH THIS. TO TO THE COMMENT ON WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS GOING TO HAPPEN HIGH SCHOOLS YEAH WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW A PREP TEAMS. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A SUBJECT THIS HELP WILL HELP SET. THE BAR I THINK FOR THAT AS WELL AND THEN ALSO -- FOR MY GOOD FRIEND FROM -- LOCKING YADA. I THINK THE FACT THAT HE SAID. THE STATEMENT HE MADE THAT -- YOU KNOW HE ASSUMES FACTS WITHOUT EVIDENCE SAYING HE IS THE BIGGEST SPORTS FAN IN THIS BUILDING SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. REALLY SENATOR JACKSON'S BOLD. WELL I WOULD CONTEST SAID TO AND I HAVE FOLLOWED US SPORTS MY WHOLE LIFE -- AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU KNOW THAT COLLEGE SPORTS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CORRUPTED AS WITH GREAT SCANDALS. SOME OF THEM RIGHT NOW IN A DIVERSITY OF ISSUES RELATED TO OUR STUDENT ATHLETES RELATED TO SPORTS RELATED -- TO SPORTS AGENTS. I THINK IT'S TIME THIS ALL CAME OUT FROM THE SHADOWS. AND THAT WE DID PUT SOME RULES AND REGULATIONS WE KNOW THAT IN SOME OF THE TOP. UNIVERSITIES IN FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL AND OTHER SPORTS. THERE ARE EFFORTS AND CREATIVE EFFORTS I MIGHT SAY. TO TRY TO CIRCUMVENT THE RULES OF AMATEUR SPORTS. WE HAD THAT WITH THE OLYMPICS UNTIL FINALLY THEY SAID OKAY WE GIVE UP. OF WE WE'RE NOT GOING TO INSIST THAT YOU. SUBJECT YOURSELF TO A LIFE OF POVERTY IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN THE ATHLETICS. I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT SPORTS. IN COLLEGE SPORTS STARTED TAKING A REAL HONEST LOOK AT WHAT ATHLETICS MEAN TO THE SCHOOLS. WHAT THEY MEAN TO OUR STUDENT ATHLETES THAT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY SOME OF THE BENEFITS BUT I ALSO CAUTION? THAT UNLESS THERE'S SOME REGULATION. AND MANY OF US HERE HAVE HEARD HORROR STORIES ABOUT SPORTS AGENTS. HOW THEY HAVE MANIPULATED PARTICULARLY YOUNG? PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND YOUNG ATHLETES IN GENERAL. AND USE THE MEN MANIPULATED THEM TO THEIR OWN GREED AND ADVANTAGE LEAVING THOSE STUDENT ATHLETES OFTENTIMES SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS BEING THROWN OUT OF SCHOOL. BECAUSE OF THE EFFORTS OF THESE AGENTS SO AS WE GO FORWARD AND I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND I HOPE WE ALL WILL WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THERE HAS TO BE IN INFRASTRUCTURE THERE.% SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FROM THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY WILL EXPERIENCE FROM A YA A WORLD OUT THERE OF SPORTS AGENTS WHO HAVE NO RULES NO REGULATIONS -- NO ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ATHLETES GET. THE RECOGNITION AND HE VERY -- BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE WITHOUT BEING MANIPULATED AND USED BY THOSE WHO ARE MORE SOPHISTICATED IN OTHER TYPES OF MORE WORLDLY BEHAVIORS CAESAR ATHLETES AND I CAN SAY I HAVE A GRANDSON WHO IS. FINISHING UP. FOUR YEAR COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP TO A MAJOR UNIVERSITY WENT TO THE NC TWO WAYS AS A STARTING GUARD ON HIS BASKETBALL TEAM. THESE KIDS. AS YOUNG PEOPLE WORK HARD. THEIR PARENTS WERE CARDS SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE ADVANTAGES OF THE CLUBS IN THE KINDS OF EXPERTISE THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BECOME GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO. BUT THEY ARE NOT SOPHISTICATED IN THE WORLD OUT THERE AND THEY ARE OFTEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF OF FORTUNATELY I HAVE A GRANDSON HE'S GOT A GOOD HEAD ON YOUR SHOULDERS. BUT NOT EVERY YOUNG PERSON IS ABLE TO TRAVERSE THESE VERY TRICKY WATERS AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD AS WE GIVE THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF THEIR HARD WORK IN THEIR TALENT. WE'VE GOT TO REMEMBER THEY CANNOT DO THIS ALONE AND WITH THAT I WOULD -- DRIVE VOTE SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS -- I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM BERKELEY FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP I I WILL ADMIT THAT -- WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE BILL AS IT CAME TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE OZ THAT'S KINDA SKEPTICAL ABOUT IT? I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE BILL IT TALK TO ME IN THE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES ABOUT THIS BILL -- BUT WHEN THEY WERE SITTING BEFORE US IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE ASKED THEM I SAID WELL YOU KNOW YOU YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD VIOLATE NC DOUBLE A RULES AND OUT OF COURSE AFFECT JOCK BUT PROGRAMS BUT YOU INHERENTLY. AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY PROPOSES THAT ACTUALLY STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE -- TO BENEFITS -- FOR FROM THEIR OWN ACTUALLY EFFORTS. AND FOR MOST PARTY ON THERE MAY BE SOME TWEAKS OR SOMETHING I SAID NOW WE DON'T ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT AND THEN I ASK THEM SAID WELL THE NC DOUBLE A WHICH MAKES THE RULES IS ACTUALLY A GROUP OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN. THE BOARD IS COMPOSED OF COLLEGE PRESIDENTS SO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE THE CHANGE THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. IT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE MUCH OF AN ANSWER TO THAT. AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE SET THIS TABLE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IF YOU HAVE A COLLEGE STUDENT WHO WROTE A WONDERFUL SONG. AND IT TOOK OFF ON A STREAMING SERVICE OR SOMETHING. ARE THEY WOULD GET ROYALTIES FOR THAT. RIGHT -- SOMEONE WHO'S A YOUTUBE STAR MAY BE DOING I DON'T KNOW CAUSE MEDICS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I WILL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S ON YOU TOO BUT THEY COULD PROBABLY ACTUALLY MONETIZE AND NOT HAVE TO LEAVE SCHOOL. RIGHT I MEAN IT'S THEIR CHOICE WHERE THEY WANT TO OR NOT. BUT THESE ATHLETES ARE ACTUALLY -- TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT BENEFIT FROM THEIR OWN IMAGE FROM THERE AND NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT BENEFIT FROM IT THE SCHOOL CERTAINLY BENEFITS FROM IT THE SCHOOL MARKETS IT HEAVILY. AND I THINK THIS IS. FRANKLY UNFAIR AND IN JACK'S -- THROUGH THEIR OWN EFFORTS SO I AGREE WITH MY BRENDA WHO TALKS ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOME GUIDELINES RIGHT WE WANT TO SEE IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BUT I THINK THE IDEA THAT. STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR OWN TALENTS AND EFFORT. I JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE IN ATHLETICS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE WE NEED TO CHALLENGE OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO MAKE THAT CHANGE -- AND TO FIGHT FOR THAT AND SO -- I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUES A BROADER ISSUE. BUT CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST LIKE ANY OTHER STUDENTS -- BENEFIT SENATOR MORE LOCKED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SITE I AM REALLY ENJOYING THIS DEBATE I AM NOT A SPORTS GUY BASKETBALLS FOR CALL PEOPLE [inaudible] ITEM. HI MY A I'M WE ARE PART OF THE STATE LEGISLATIVE BODY I'M NOT PART OF A NATIONAL. COLLEGIAN ORGANIZATION SITE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR IF I COULD JUST TO CLARIFY. JUST UNPLUG CENTER SKINNER WILL YOU ACCEPT QUESTION YES -- MATRICES SENATOR I BEING TOLD -- YOU KNOW THAT. IF WE IF WE DO SOMETHING UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT THAT WERE. WE WE WE WOULD BE TREATED UNFAVORABLY OR WE COULD BE PENALIZED. AND SO WHAT WHAT COULD THE NC A A DUE TO CALIFORNIA COULD EXCLUDE THE CAMPUSES IN CALIFORNIA FROM ITS. NETWORK OF ORGANIZED SPORTS. PERMISSION ANSWER THE CONCERN BY SOME OF OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COLLEGES IS THAT THE N. C. TWO WAY. WOULD -- RETALIATE BECAUSE UNDER THIS BILL IF STUDENTS WERE Q. AND BE ABLE TO GAIN SOME EARNINGS OFF THEIR IMAGE OR LIKENESS THAT THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF THE RULES THAT THE AND SEE TO A HAS PUT INTO PLACE. NOW THE BILL IS EXPLICITLY% WRITTEN. TO IN FACT -- DIRECT. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE THE JURISDICTION OVER THE NC TWO WEIGH. IT DEFINITELY ADDS PROTECTIONS TO THE COLLEGES BUT EFFICIENCY TO A WERE TO CHOOSE TO THAT COULD CONCEIVABLY HAPPEN. BUT I THINK THE BENEFIT OF THE BOTH THE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION AND THE FACT THAT WILL AND I WILL GIVE THIS INFORMATION TO MY CLOTHES THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER FRONTS. NOW INFLUENCING THE NC TWO EIGHT TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION I FEEL THAT. OUR WHATEVER FEARS OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COLLEGES MAY HAVE. ON MAY PROVE TO BE ON WARRANTED. SO WE HAVE A CHESS GAME GOING ON AND WE'RE MAKING A POTENTIAL MOVE. AND IF THE NC A A SAYS FINE YOU TAKE THAT POSITION WE WILL EXCLUDE CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES FROM OUR CALENDAR. THEN WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO THE POTENTIAL SPONSORSHIPS. OF THE STUDENTS WERE TRYING TO ASSIST. THIS IS SPECULATIVE -- AND CERTAINLY -- WE HAS THE LEGISLATURE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY. OUR LAWS IF THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THAT WE THINK ARE -- WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT. BUT AS I INDICATED THERE IS ENOUGH MOMENTUM AROUND THIS ISSUE AND ANY OF US WHO ARE SPORTS FANS YOU WILL NOTICE THAT -- IT IS ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR TOPICS ON ESPN. IT HAS BEEN NOW FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. OKAY. THEN -- I HAD A FEW MORE QUESTIONS BUT MAYBE IT JUST BRING IT DOWN TO THE LAST ONE IF WE DO JEOPARDIZE. OUR STATE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE NC DOUBLE A WITH THAT ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA. RESIDENTS TO GO TO SCHOOLS IN OTHER STATES AND THEIR THEIR POOR JEOPARDIZE OUR SYSTEM. I I'M CONSUMER MAYBE MAYBE TO RHETORICAL QUESTION ADDRESSED IT'S RHETORICAL. WHAT KIDS WITHIN UP IT ON MY OWN TIME? THAT A PRESIDENT JUST. ARE YOU I LOVE LEVERAGE I LOVE. TRYING. TO NEGOTIATE IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PRESSURE BUT I I I I DON'T KNOW IF I'M COMFORTABLE RISKING. THE THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS IN OUR COLLEGES I SUB STILL WORKING THIS THROUGH AND I'LL LOOK FOR TO MORE DEBATE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANKS SO MUCH SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS -- THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD ON THE FLOOR I WOULD NOTE -- MY CO AUTHOR OF THE SENATOR FROM GARDENIA. POINTING OUT THAT OUR HIGHEST PAID STATE EMPLOYEES IN ANY FOR US CAN GO ON TO THE SECOND BE AND FIND THE DIRECTORY THAT SHOWS THE HIGHEST PAID STATE EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE. OUR COACHES COLLEGE COACHES AND ATHLETIC DIRECTORS. I'M IN YET WE DO WE THE ONLY CATEGORY OF STUDENTS THE ONLY. THAT WE WOULD PREVENT FROM BEING ABLE TO GAIN ANY EARNING FROM THE INCREDIBLE TALENT THAT THEY BRING. IS STUDENT ATHLETES NOW I KNOW THE CONCERN THAT OUR COLLEGES MAY MAY SUFFER CONSEQUENCE. BUT THIS THIS DISCUSSION IT'S LIKE SO MANY THINGS I AM NOT THE FIRST INTRODUCED THIS AT OUR ACTION WOULD REALLY BE FOLLOWING A LONG TRADITION AND BE MORE RESPONSIVE THAN SO MUCH. THAT WERE THE THE HARBINGERS RIGHT IT'S MORE RESPONSIVE BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSIONS IN BILLS OF A SIMILAR NATURE. IN BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST YES THEY DID NOT PROCEED BUT THE SET THE STAGE FOR THIS BROADER CONVERSATION TO THE POINT NOW WHERE AS I MENTIONED IF YOU LISTEN TO ESPN OR WATCH THE COLLEGE IT WHETHER IT'S MARCH MADNESS. OR THE AT VARIOUS BOWL GAMES DURING THE FOOTBALL SEASON AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN PLAYERS COMMENTATORS FORMER PLAYERS. BRING UP THIS SUBJECT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE DOCUMENTARY THE STUDENT ATHLETE THAT IS ON HBO RIGHT NOW. NOW CALIFORNIA WOULD HOPEFULLY NOT BE ACTING ALONE AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE THERE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL IN CONGRESS RIGHT NOW. INTRODUCED BY CONGRESS MEMBERS WALKER ENRICHMENT. AND THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO ARE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION AND ENTERTAINING LEGISLATION JUST LIKE OURS. AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL ACT IN ADDITION TO US GIVING MORE INSURANCE TO OUR COLLEGES BUT LET US FINALLY SAY THE POINT THAT MY COLLEAGUE THE SUIT MADE. IT IS COLLEGES THAT MAKE UP THE BOARD OF THE NC TWO WAY. DATE CAN PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE AND GET THE NC TWO EIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND CHANGE THEIR RULES WE WOULD ONLY BE HELPING THEM TO DO SO. AND SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN. I ARCHULETA. AYE ATKINS AYE BATES. NO BILL [inaudible] I PORGES. BRADFORD. BY CAMBIADO HI.
