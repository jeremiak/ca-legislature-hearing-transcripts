01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.716
CAME DOWN. I DON'T THINK FIVE

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:27.950
THOUSAND STUDENTS SHOULD REALLY

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.286
PAY THE PRICE FOR A BAD YOUR

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.355
CREDIT DECISIONS AND A VERY.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.524
POOR LAWYER WHO MADE A

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.459
DISPOSITION ARE NOT REALLY DOING

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:38.728
HIS OR HER JOB. AND SO TODAY WE

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.398
ARE RISING TO DO A COUPLE THINGS

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.667
ONE IS TO ENSURE THAT. WE TALK

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.536
ABOUT ANY UNIVERSITY COLLEGE AS

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.638
LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:49.872
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAMPUS

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:50.873
ENROLLMENT WILL TALK ABOUT

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.408
CAMPUS POPULATION NOT TO STUDENT

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.410
ENROLLMENT. CAMPUS POPULATION

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.646
INCLUDES STUDENTS FACULTY AS

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.681
WELL AS STAFF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:01.284
WERE AT A PARTICULAR UNIVERSITY

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.019
THAT DID NOT A DEFINITION IS

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.987
VERY ACCURATE AND REFLECTIVE OF

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.556
THE IMPACT OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.657
THAT PARTICULAR CITY AND WHAT'S

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:10.359
GOING ON. ALSO WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.695
THAT THE DRACONIAN JUDGE CAN'T

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.530
JUST HAND DOWN A DECISION

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.566
WITHOUT GIVING IT A UNIVERSITY

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:17.600
OR COLLEGE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:20.369
REMEDY IT. SO IF THE LONG RANGE

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.271
DEVELOPMENT PLAN IS SOMETHING TO

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.941
PORT DOES NOT LIKE THAT WORK CAN

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.843
ASK THE UNIVERSITY TO ADDRESS IT

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.478
AND COME BACK IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.745
AND THEN AFTER THAT. COULD DO

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:32.281
SOMETHING BUT ONLY INTEL ONLY

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.083
ALLOWING THE ONLY TO THE ALLOW

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.252
THE UNIVERSITY TO DO SOMETHING

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.620
ABOUT THEIR LONG RICH ABOUT THE

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.889
PLAN THIS IS A VERY SURGICAL

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:40.923
APPROACH TO THIS PARTICULAR

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.658
DECISION. I DON'T THINK IT HAS

01:02:42.725 --> 01:02:44.360
LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT I

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.095
THINK IT REALLY. ACCURATELY

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:47.830
DESCRIBES WHAT A LONG RANGE

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:49.632
DEVELOPMENT PLAN SHOULD BE AS

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.869
WELL AS LIMITING THE A SOLUTION

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.138
TO COURT COULD PRESCRIBE WITHOUT

01:02:55.204 --> 01:03:00.776
I SUSPECT WE ASK. FOR YOUR VOTE

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:02.245

FROM HOW MANY STUDENTS WE LEAD

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.119

FROM THE STATE'S EQUAL LAW TO

THIS LAST MINUTE BILL HOWEVER

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:32.762
HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT SEQUEL

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.131
IS DATED AND BROKEN. THE SEQUEL

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.767
LAW WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:38.634
SEVENTY OVER A HALF A CENTURY

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:41.570
AGO. OUR STATE WAS DIFFERENT OUR

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.506
NEEDS WERE DIFFERENT OUR STATE

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.441
IS NOW DEFINED BY CRISIS AFTER

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:47.677
CRISIS FROM HOMELESSNESS TO ONE

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:48.844
OF OUR PREVENTION. THE

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:49.779

INFRASTRUCTURE TO WATER STORAGE

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.382
AND TO HOUSING. BUT OVER THE

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.418
YEARS SEQUEL HAS BEEN ABUSED

01:05:55.484 --> 01:05:57.153
THROUGH LITIGATION. TO STOP

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:58.921
PROJECTS THAT SERVE OUR

01:05:58.988 --> 01:05:59.822
COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS THESE

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:02.658
CRISES. OFTENTIMES THE REASONS

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.393
TO STOP THE PROJECTS. HAVE

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:05.328
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.495
ENVIRONMENT BUT HAVE BEEN USED

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.664
BY GROUPS WITH NARROW AGENDAS TO

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.367
PURSUE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AS WE

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.436
SEE RIGHT NOW. IN KERN COUNTY

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:14.837
NEED HIGHWAY SAFETY PROJECTS

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:16.005
HAVE BEEN DELAYED DRIVING UP

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:17.740
COSTS AND EXPENSES A PRECIOUS

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:19.508
TAX DOLLARS. NEEDED HOUSING

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.510
PROJECTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.713
FROM THE TOP OF THE STATE TO THE

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:24.613
BAY AREA. THROUGH THE CENTRAL

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.082
VALLEY AND DOWN TO SOUTHERN

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.483
CALIFORNIA. THESE PROJECTS BEEN

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.484
HELD UP BY LAWSUITS USING

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.486
SEQUEL. HOUSING THAT WOULD HELP

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.755
EASE THE STATE'S HOUSING AND

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.357
AFFORDABLE FOR ABILITY CRISIS.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:35.458
WE NOW SEE ANOTHER SEQUEL

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.326
LAWSUIT AGAINST UC BERKELEY THAT

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.829
HAS LED TO UNFORTUNATE REAL

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.198
WORLD CONSEQUENCES IMPACTING THE

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.367
ABILITY TO PROVIDE HIGHER

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.402

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.404
THIS BILL AS NECESSARY IT

01:06:48.471 --> 01:06:49.939
FOLLOWS A LONG LINE OF SECRET

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:51.674
CHANGES THAT ONLY HIGHLIGHTS THE

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:54.276
NEED FOR A BROAD BASED REFORM OF

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.579
THIS AW. A GROWING CONSENSUS ON

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.147
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.215
RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SEEK

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:02.184
REFORM. BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS

01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:04.186
IS THERE THE POLITICAL WILL TO

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:06.956
MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WHERE WILL OUR

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:09.058
STATE. CONTINUE TO BE PARALYZED

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.893
BY CIVIL LAWSUITS THAT WILL

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.062
PREVENT NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.697
OUR COMMUNITIES FROM TAKING

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.732
PLACE. THIS BILL CORRECTS A

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.634
CLEAR ABUSE OF SEQUEL AND I URGE

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.237

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.795
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND THAT EXPLAIN

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:48.164

ON THIS MEASURE. WHAT IS CHAIR

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.702
OF HIGHER EDUCATION I THINK THAT

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:55.271
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE AS A

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:58.541
