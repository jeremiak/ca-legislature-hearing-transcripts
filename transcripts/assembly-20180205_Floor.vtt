MANY PEOPLE ON THIS FLOOR I'M

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:55.204 region:rollup2
GLAD I HAD THAT OUR COLLEAGUE

01:07:53.770 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
FROM LAKE ELSINORE HAS CONTINUE

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:57.273 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON THIS CONTINUE IMPROVE

01:07:56.439 --> 01:07:59.108 region:rollup2
THE BELL AND THAT WERE BEING

01:07:57.273 --> 01:08:00.310 region:rollup2
ABLE TO. HAVE IT ENACTED

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:02.512 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.646 region:rollup2
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

01:08:02.512 --> 01:08:05.214 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:07.016 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S A FIRST STEP AND IT'S

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:08.084 region:rollup2
AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP.

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:10.286 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T WANT ANY OF OUR

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:11.354 region:rollup2
STAFF OR ANY OF US TO FEEL

01:08:10.286 --> 01:08:12.956 region:rollup2
ASSURED THAT WE'VE COMPLETED THE

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:14.424 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:08:12.956 --> 01:08:15.291 region:rollup2
THE TRUTH IS OUR STAFF IN THIS

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.893 region:rollup2
BUILDING ARE STILL AT WILL

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.061 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:20.163 region:rollup2
AS SOMEBODY WHO CAME FROM

01:08:18.061 --> 01:08:21.698 region:rollup2
ORGANIZED LABOR AND UNDERSTAND

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:23.700 region:rollup2
DEEPLY THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:24.601 region:rollup2
OUT WELL EMPLOYEES AND THOSE

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.769 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE PROTECTIONS OF EITHER

01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
CIVIL SERVICE. AND OR MORE

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:30.306 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY A UNION CONTRACT IT

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:31.608 region:rollup2
STILL LEAVES THEM VULNERABLE.

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.909 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT DOES

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.243 region:rollup2
NOT HAPPEN IN THIS BILL THAT

01:08:32.909 --> 01:08:35.845 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TOUGH TO PUT IN BUT ONE

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.512 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. AND

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:38.581 region:rollup2
THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:40.483 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION SO WE HAVE CERTAIN

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:41.851 region:rollup2
LAWS WE PASS WHETHER IT'S PAID

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:43.286 region:rollup2
SICK DAYS WHETHER IT'S

01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:45.655 region:rollup2
IMMIGRATION RELATED OFFENSES

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:47.357 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THAT. AFTER A

01:08:45.655 --> 01:08:49.225 region:rollup2
COMPLAINT IT IS IS.

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:50.126 region:rollup2
IS I WATCHED OR AFTER CITY HAS

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.828 region:rollup2
TAKEN THAT YOU HAVE A

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.830 region:rollup2
PRESUMPTION FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:55.198 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOUR RETALIATED AGAINST

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.799 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT YOU

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:58.701 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO BE. THE ONE TO

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.936 region:rollup2
PROVE THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:01.404 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S WHAT A PRESUMPTION

01:08:59.936 --> 01:09:02.171 region:rollup2
IS A LOT AND ONE THAT WE NEED

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.606 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.575 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT NOT ONLY IN THIS

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:06.576 region:rollup2
BUILDING. BUTTON AND WORKFORCE

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:07.443 region:rollup2
AT LARGE

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.745 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:10.446 region:rollup2
FEATURE BECAUSE SOMEBODY

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:12.181 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY YES I WAS

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:14.183 region:rollup2

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.818 region:rollup2

WE'VE IF YOU'RE TO BE FORTY ONE

01:09:22.458 --> 01:09:25.395 region:rollup2
WHICH I WOULD. HOPE TO WORK WITH

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:27.597 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:28.731 region:rollup2
AT AS SOMETHING WE COULD PUT IN

01:09:27.597 --> 01:09:29.899 region:rollup2
PLACE HERE.

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:30.867 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I'D SAY THIS I'M

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.668 region:rollup2

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:38.474 region:rollup2
AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST STATED.

01:09:36.806 --> 01:09:40.276 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE WOMEN IN EVERY

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:42.278 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY WHO DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:09:40.276 --> 01:09:44.580 region:rollup2
THIS BASIC PROTECTION WHO HAVE

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:45.681 region:rollup2
BASICALLY NO PROTECTION AGAINST

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.550 region:rollup2
RETALIATION FOR CLAIMS OF SEXUAL

01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:49.452 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT. AND I HOPE WE'LL SEE

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:57.006 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS BODY ACTUALLY OWES

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:57.974 region:rollup2
THIS INSTITUTION IN THIS BODY

01:12:57.006 --> 01:13:00.109 region:rollup2
PASSED THE BILL SEVERAL TIMES

01:12:57.974 --> 01:13:01.978 region:rollup2

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.484 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE MEMBER ALSO FOR

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.952 region:rollup2
MAKING THIS A MEASURE THAT WAS

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.820 region:rollup2

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:25.868 region:rollup2

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:27.536 region:rollup2
THEY WORK VERY VERY HARD EVERY

01:13:39.148 --> 01:13:43.586 region:rollup2
IN GETTING THAT THAT WAY.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:45.087 region:rollup2

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:49.592 region:rollup2
ARE STILL STAFF THAT ARE GOING

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:51.360 region:rollup2
TED NOT HAVE YET AN INDEPENDENT.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:52.762 region:rollup2
PRIVATE WAY WHICH THEY CAN RAISE

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.996 region:rollup2
A CONCERN WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.865 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANY

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:56.932 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE AND

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:59.402 region:rollup2
GOING SOMEWHERE THAT WE ARE NOT

01:13:56.932 --> 01:14:00.736 region:rollup2

BUT I THINK THIS IS A A

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:12.982 region:rollup2

NO PROTECTION.

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:57.599 region:rollup2

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.741 region:rollup2
DIGNITY.

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:08.143 region:rollup2
THE LOSS OF ONE'S SELF WORTH AND

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:09.845 region:rollup2
SELF CONFIDENCE.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.747 region:rollup2
THE STRAIN ON ONE'S RELATIONSHIP

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:13.682 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES.

01:24:11.747 --> 01:24:16.919 region:rollup2
