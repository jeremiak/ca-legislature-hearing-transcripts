WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO- JOINED HERE WITH MY- JOINT AUTHORS- CRISTINA GARCIA AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO WOULD PROHIBIT THE WORD- A DEROGATORY NAME TOWARDS NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN- WE CAUGHT THE S. WORD BILL BUT I'LL SAY THE WORDS SO THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COULD UNDERSTAND TRULY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD THIS DEROGATORY TO NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN IS THE WORD SQUAW. NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN ARE THE PILLARS OF NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES- BRINGING STABILITY AND RESPECT TO ALL OF OUR PEOPLE THIS WORD IS STILL BEING USED IN WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS PUTTING A GREAT DISSERVICE TO THE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE STATE IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS WORD REFLECTS THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE TREATMENT OF NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN WHERE THIS BODY HAS HEARD ME SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. WHEN WE SEE THE MENTALITY BACK IN THESE DAYS AND USING THESE TYPES OF TERMS ONLY PRESENTS THE MENTALITY AND THE PERCEPTION OF NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN AS LESS THAN EQUAL TO OTHERS INDIGENOUS WOMEN ARE CURRENTLY COMES OF MURDER RATES MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN THIS. SPECT DEMONSTRATED AGAINST NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN THIS BILL REQUIRES EVERY STATE AGENCY LOCAL GOVERNING BODY AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS IN THE STATE TO IDENTIFY ALL GEOGRAPHIC SITES PUBLIC LANDS WATERS AND STRUCTURES UNDER HIS JURISDICTION TO CONTAINING THIS RACIAL TERMS AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE TO ELICIT INPUT AND RENAME LOCATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. SELECTING REPLACEMENT NAMES A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STATE AGENCIES IN THE CALIFORNIA ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHALL SOLICIT INPUT FROM TRIBES MAINTAINED ON THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN-HERITAGE COMMISSION LIST. TODAY I ALSO HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY DANIELLE FRANK FROM THE NATIVE SISTER CIRCLE AND MORNING STAR GALI OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE COMPONENT. THIS IS A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD AS A LEGISLATURE IS START TO CORRECT SOME OF THESE DEROGATORY NAMES AND THE MENTALITY OF PERCEPTION TOWARDS NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN I WOULD ALSO NOW LIKE TO- HAVE MY JOINT CO AUTHOR CRISTINA GARCIA SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS AND MEMBER I AM HUMBLED TO BE HERE WITH MISTER ROMMEL'S AND OUR WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AS THE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WORKING TO EMPOWER ALL WOMEN IN BEING INCLUSIVE HAS BEEN A PARTY FOR MYSELF. OUT HERE AND EXCITED THAT WE GET TO WORK ON THIS BILL TOGETHER THE S. WORD IS A RACIST AND MISOGYNISTIC. OSTLER THE TERM IS USED BY EARLY CALIFORNIA SETTLERS AND ACCOUNTS OF BRUTAL RAPE AND SLAVE MAN AND GENOCIDE OF NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN GIRLS AND COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE OVER A HUNDRED YOUR GRAPHIC FEATURES AND PLACES NAMES IN CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDE THE S. WORD. OUT THERE. THE SAD REALITY IS THAT THE TERM HAS BEEN USED FOR GENERATIONS AND IT'S BEEN NORMALIZED. EVEN THOUGH IT'S A MASSAGE AND RACIST TERM ROOTED IN THE OPPRESSION OF BELITTLING OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN. THE BILL BEGINS TO CORRECT AN UGLY AND PEOPLE PART OF OUR HISTORY BY REMOVING IT FROM CALIFORNIA LANDMARKS. IT'S ELISE IT CAN DO TO HELP OUR INDIGENOUS WOMEN HEEL OUT THERE BUT IT'S REALLY JUST ONE STEP OF MANY WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO GAIN REAL RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. OUT THERE ON COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK AND WHEN TIME IS APPROPRIATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. MISS FRANK WOULD YOU LIKE TO START. HE- WE DO THING YOUR WHOLE AREA HELLO MY NAME IS DANIEL FRANK I'M AN ENROLLED MEMBER OF THE GROUP A TRIBE AS WELL AS THE YOUTH COORDINATOR AT SAVE CALIFORNIA SALMON. I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING I'M HONORED TO BE HERE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR MY PEOPLE AND WOMEN JUST LIKE ME TODAY WE'RE HERE TO EXPLAIN THAT THE S. WORD IS IN NO WAY A COMPLIMENT OR TRIBUTE TO INDIGENOUS WOMEN ALTHOUGH IT IS A DEROGATORY TERM. WITH A LONG HISTORY OF GLORIFYING THE SEXUAL ABUSE THAT ONE INTO INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY STILL FACE TODAY. TO NAME OUR LANDS AND WATERS AFTER ADJOURNMENT TO DE HUMANIZE THE INDIGENOUS WOMEN IS THE BIGGEST INSULT TO THE ORIGINAL HOUSE INHABITANTS OF THAT LAND THAT I CAN IMAGINE. ALL WE ARE ASKING IS THAT THE INDIGNITIES THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FACE IN THIS DAY EVERY DAY. BE LESSENED AND THAT ARE NATIVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE ABLE TO FEEL AT HOME ON THEIR ANCESTRAL LAND. TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE CALIFORNIA A PLACE WHERE THE NATIVE COMMUNITY FEELS AT HOME BECAUSE WE ARE. HELP US RECTIFY THE WRONGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS COMMITTED AGAINST ITS NATIVE POPULATION. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A LONG JOURNEY OF MUCH NEEDED HEALING FOR CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY THANK MEMBER RAMOS THE NUMBER GARCIA FOR.

THE REMOVAL OF THE S. WORD THAT'S WHAT IS AN EPITHET THAT HAS HISTORIC TIES TO RACISM AND SEXUALISATION OF NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN IT IS A TERM THAT IS DEHUMANIZING DEVALUING AND DEROGATORY. IT IS A RACIAL SLUR THAT IS CULTURALLY DEMEANING AND DEGRADING TO NATIVE WOMEN. THOSE THERE ARE THOSE THAT WILL WANT TO ARGUE THAT THE SLUR SOMEHOW SHOWING RESPECT FOR US BUT AS INDIGENOUS WOMEN WE ARE RIGHT FOR BEFORE YOU EXPLAINING TO YOU THAT THIS WORD IS NOT RESPECTFUL. IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED WITH RACIST AND DEGRADING MASCOTS THEY WILL SAY THAT WE'RE HONORING WITH YOU WITH CARTOON CHARACTERS IT IS TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE ARE NO LONGER STANDING FOR THAT INSULT. WE ARE COMMITTED TO SHIFTING THE NARRATIVE TOWARDS TRUTH TELLING AND RACIAL JUSTICE JUSTICE CALIFORNIA AS A STATE WAS FOUNDED ON STATE SPONSORED GENOCIDE. IT IS TIME NOW TO TAKE MEASURES TO RECTIFY THE WRONGS THAT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED. THIS IS A STEP. IN AND JUST FOR TWO. AND PEOPLE. AND FOR ON EIGHT AMERICAN PEOPLE'S THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO ONE ACT THE FOLLOWING TO IDENTIFY ALL PLACES WHERE THIS WORD IS USED. FOR PLACE NAMES IN CALIFORNIA TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS.

GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PROPERS IN AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE SOMETHING WE DON'T ALWAYS DO WELL IN GOVERNMENT. ONLY THE WATER BOARD HAS NO FULL TIME STAFF DEDICATED TO DROUGHT PLANNING AND RESPONSE. THIS MEANS THAT WHEN DROUGHT STRIKES THE GOVERNOR DECLARES EMERGENCY AND THE BOARD TEMPORARILY ASSIGNS EXISTING STAFF TO THESE DUTIES FOR THE DURATION OF THE EMERGENCY. ABA MACBOOK BECAUSE IT MEANS WE ARE BEING REACTIONARY BECAUSE RIPPLING STAFF AWAY FROM THEIR DAY JOBS EVEN OTHER IMPORTANT WORK UNDERSTAFFED. THE FIRST ELEMENT OF THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT THAT DYNAMIC BY CREATING A DEDICATED DROUGHT UNIT WITHIN THE DIVISION OF WATER RIGHTS AT THE WATER BOARD. SECOND THE BILL ESTABLISHES A PILOT PROJECT IN SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST CRITICAL SALMON AND STEELHEAD BEARING WATERSHEDS. THE PILOT DIRECTS THE WATER BOARD TO PREPARE DROUGHT CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR SUCCESS FOR SELECT COASTAL WATERSHEDS THAT ARE PRIORITY FISH BEARING STREAMS AND CURRENTLY LACK MEANINGFUL WATER MANAGEMENT PLANS. THE GOAL OF THIS POWERS TO CREATE A BALANCE OF INCENTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL HELP WATER USERS. IN SELECT WATERSHED UPDATE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND USER USAGE PATTERNS AND BE MORE PREPARED FOR THE EXTENDED DROUGHT PERIODS THAT HAVE BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR. ULTIMATELY THESE CONTINGENCY PLANS WILL CREATE TRANSPARENCY. PREDICTABILITY AND RESILIENCY DURING TIMES OF SEVERE DROUGHT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CORRECTLY CAPTURE THE APPROPRIATE WATERSHEDS FOR THIS PILOT. AND WE GIVE THE BOARD CLEAR DIRECTION ABOUT THE KINDS OF INCENTIVES AND PARTNERSHIPS WE WANT TO SEE IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM. I'M COMMITTED TO THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND GRATEFUL FOR THE CONTINUED WORK BY STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES. AND DETERMINED IT TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE RIGHT MIX OF INCENTIVES IN THE BILL MOVING FORWARD. MEMBERS LAST YEAR I WORKED ON LEGISLATION THAT ADDED CAPACITY TO CAL FIRE TO START PREPARING FOR THE NEXT FIRE BEFORE IT STARTS BURNING. IT'S PAST TIME THAT WE START PREPARING FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT. BEFORE IT STOPS RAINING. HERE TO TESTIFY N SUPPORT R. J. IS JAY ZIGGLER- IN THAT NATURE CONSERVANCY AND BRIAN JOHNSON WITH TROUT UNLIMITED MAY BE ON THE PHONE BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HIM BUT- IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAID THANK YOU- AM J. ZIEGLER THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY ONE- IT IS TIME ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD NOTES TO MANAGE WATER- BUT FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE AGRICULTURE AND WILDLIFE- AS WE FACE- CONTINUED PATTERNS OF DROUGHT- IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT- RIVERS ON THE NORTH COAST RAND DRYING AND THIS PAST YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN RECORDED HISTORY. AND WE CERTAINLY SEE WATER DEMAND ACCELERATING- ALL AROUND US THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND IT'S TIME TO ACTUALLY PLAN TO USE THE WATER IN THESE- WATER SETS MORE WISELY- FOR THE BENEFIT- OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY ONE WILL BILL THE CENTRAL CAPACITY AT THE STATE BOARD- TO ADDRESS DROUGHT AHEAD OF- ITS OCCURRENCE AND INSTEAD PLANNED METHODICALLY. AS DOCTOR WOULD NOTES TO PUT THE RIGHT FRAMEWORK OF INCENTIVES IN PLACE TO APPLY THE BEST SCIENCE TO PLAN FOR DIVERSIONS WHEN WATER IS ABUNDANT AND RIVER SYSTEMS- TO LAY OFF THE STREAMS WHEN WATER IS LESS ABUNDANT FOR NATURE- AND TO REPORT ON ACT OUTCOMES AND ADAPTIVELY MANAGE IN A WAY THAT SETS AN EXAMPLE- OF- WATERSHED MANAGEMENT WATER HEALTH- THAT WILL TRULY BENEFIT. PEOPLE AND NATURE ABOUT HOW- WEADAPT TO CHANGING- HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE- THEN IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WE SEE THAT- THIS FRAMEWORK WILL BUILD ESSENTIAL CAPACITY AT THE BOARD- TO HAVE MORE RELIABLE ACCESSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT. PLANNING THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND STRONGLY SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY ONE. THANK YOU.

BY SHARE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES. THE SO I'M HERE THIS MORNING TO BE A SOME BILL TWO ONE ZERO EIGHT WHICH SEEKS TO ELEVATE THE VOICES OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM WATER POLICY- SOME DECISIONS- BY SHOWING THAT WE DESIGNATE ONE SEAT ON THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER BOARDS- TO BE FILLED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OR TRIBAL- A COMMUNITY MEMBER. HAS LEGISLATION ALSO SEEKS TO INCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ANALYSIS INTO THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR MAJOR FOR MAJOR WATER PERMITS. THIS YEAR MARKS THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT- AND ON THIS FIFTIETH YEAR ANNIVERSARY MANY LOW INCOME- SO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR STILL LACK ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER. MANY OF THESE UNDERSERVED AND UNDER RESOURCE- SOME COMMUNITIES ARE HOME TO LOCAL WORKERS- AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO LACK THE RESOURCES LACK THE TIME AND THE ACCESS TO ADVOCATE AGAINST POLICIES THAT HARM THE COMMUNITIES RESULTING IN SOME DECADES OF NEGLECT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO SEATS RESERVED FOR A MEMBER FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OR TRAVEL COMMUTE BROWN ON OUR STATE WATER BOARDS. AND WELL THE CURRENT BOARD HAS TAKEN PROACTIVE STEPS. TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE OUTCOMES BUT WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE MOVING FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR SIGNIFICANT WATER PERMITS THAT THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER. A WITH ME HERE TO TEST OF IN WOULD BE L. SAW THE BAR BEHALF OF THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND SHAUN BOTHWELL FROM THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEP RELIANCE. WHO'S ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IN WITH THAT THANK YOU. MATTER MUCH. THANK YOU. FOR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME WE HAD SOME ABOUT NOT WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER- AND WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB ONES ARE A BY A RIVAS BECAUSE THIS BILL A CRITICAL TOOL FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE MANY OF WHICH WE HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE WITH FOR DECADES TO ADDRESS DEEP WATER AND EQUITIES- SPECIFICALLY AB TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE DURING. POLICY DECISIONS. AUDIBLE ALSO HAVE A REPORT. ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE STUDIES IMPACT. ANALYSIS AND BOTH OF THESE MEASURES ALONG WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS WITHIN THE BILL WILL ADVANCE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER CURRENTLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER WHEN THEY OPEN THE TAP. WE CANNOT LET THIS PROCESS THAN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES BEHIND WHEN ADDRESSING WATER POLICY ISSUES NOW THE STATE WATER BOARD WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN YET TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GOVERNANCE AND WAS THE FIRST GOVERNOR TO APPOINT FIVE REPRESENT IT TO THE BOARD WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BACKGROUND. THIS THAT NUMBER WAS LARA FIRES ON THE COMMITTEE WATER CENTERS CO FOUNDER AND WAS APPOINTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS MEANS THAT AFTER FIFTY TWO YEARS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY FINALLY HAD A DECISION MAKER WITH THE PROVEN BACKGROUND FOR ADVOCATING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- AB TWENTY ONE ZERO TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT WILL ENSURE THAT FORMER REPRESENTATION REMAINS. AND WILL PROVIDE MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WITH A SEAT AT THE TABLE- SINCE THEY ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BY THE DECISIONS MADE AT THE WATER BOARD IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AB TWENTY ONE ZERO EIGHT WILL NOT REPLACE OR CHANGE THE CURRENT EXISTING OUR WATER WHAT SEATS AND THAT THE BILL'S LANGUAGE IS ACTUALLY IDENTICAL TO EXISTING LANGUAGE. RELATING TO A QUALIFIED REPRESENTATIVE FROM AGRICULTURAL INTEREST IF AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS CAN HAVE A GUARANTEED REPRESENTATION AT THE WATERBOARDING THEIR KEY DECISIONS WHY CAN'T THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY WATER POLLUTION HAVE EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR THESE REASONS. WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD COMMITTEE MAIN SHOW BUFFALO ON THE DRUG FOR HEALTH BECAUSE HE PLANTS WERE ALSO THIS THE BILL'S HAPPY TO ANY TECHNICAL ARE YOU MIGHT HAVE- I WANTED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS- IN THE ANALYSIS UP BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH SOME OF THE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED FOLKS- TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE AND DRESS THEIR CONCERNS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE- THOSE PARTIES HAD BEEN VERY CONSTRUCTIVE VERY HELPFUL AND WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING THERE AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE- ON THE MINUTES TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS BUT- JUST A DRILL INTO THAT LITTLE BIT- THE CONCERNS MOSTLY COME FROM SECTIONS THREE AND FOUR OF THE BILL. SECTION THREE IS ABOUT THE PERMIT ANALYSIS PIECE OF IT AND CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION WERE THAT THE LANGUAGE SEEMS A LITTLE LOOSE A LITTLE MORE LIKE SEQUEL ANALYSIS THAN WHAT THE WATER BOARDS DO A LITTLE MORE LAND USE PLANNING SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN DRILLING INTO THAT SECTION TO SEE HOW THAT WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE AT THE WATER BOARD WE'RE ALSO REALLY WORKING TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO OPEN UP- ANY ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND IN FACT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A PROVISION THAT WOULD- MAKE SURE THAT THIS WOULD CREATE ANY NEW CAUSES OF ACTION- THIRD PARTY GROUPS- PROTECTION FOR. THE ISSUES LARGELY THE COST- AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN COMING UP NOT JUST IN THIS BILL BUT IN ALL LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT IS THE IDEA OF YOU KNOW WHEN WE RUN A BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF PROBES AND YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT DOING IT THE GENERAL FUNDS AND THEN GETS THE STATE WATER BOARD- THE PROPERTIES ARE LEFT ON THE HOOK TO ACTUALLY END UP PAYING FOR THAT PROGRAM AND SO WE ARE VERY SOME. CONCERN FROM PERMITTING. MORE WORK ON LANGUAGE THEM NOW ADDRESS. WE FEEL LIKE SECTION FOR- A JUST AS A BROADER. ISSUE NOT JUST A PERMIT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND THAT IT SHOULD COME OUT THE GENERAL FUND RATHER THAN BY PROPERTIES AND SO. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE OPPOSITION TO FIX THOSE- AND ADDRESS THOSE SSUES AND- WE WERE. WERE CONTENT WE CAN GET THERE SO. I WITHOUT I ANSWER I DON'T THINK YOU.

I WAS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR HAVE A THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AT TO TRY TO GET TO A WORKABLE PLACE CENTER DRESSED SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT STEVEN IT'S MEMBERS HAVE A WHIE ON A PRINCIPLED LEVEL OF WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT YOU ARE WATER BOARDS AND ADMINISTRATIONS YOU ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNDER CURRENT WATER CODE TO APPOINT TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVES TO THE WATER BOARDS- WE DO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS ON SOME ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE AND POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS ARE TO HELP ENSURE THAT A MINIMUM. OF THAT TO A QUORUM ISSUES ARE NOT CONCERNED ON IN TRYING TO SEEK INDIVIDUALS TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS FOR THE WATER BOARD'S CERTAINLY SOME PROGRESS ON THAT PARTICULAR POINT ADDITIONALLY I WE ALSO APPRECIATE OF THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS WORKING WITH THAT ON CONCERNS RELATED OUT TO SOME OF THE MEDICATION COMPONENTS AND HELPING TO ADDRESS THOSE ARE WORKING ON THAT SOME CHANGES ARE TO HELP ADDRESS CONCERNS THAT ARE PERHAPS OUT COULD IMPACT SOME OF THE PERMITS ARE THAT ARE RECEIVED MEMBERS I WORK WITH THE WATER PORTS ON.

GOOD MORE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M BRENDA BASS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND- AS WAS STATED WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY ONE OH EIGHT UNLESS AMENDED- I'M- HERE AGAIN AS NOTED WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OF THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR ON THIS BILL. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY- BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN- AND SO. THOSE ARE REALLY LIMITED TO SECTIONS THREE AND FOUR OF THE BALLOT HAS FOR EXPERTS AS WAS EXPLAINED EARLIER- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL ON HAS WRITTEN IT IMPOSES NEW ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS RELATED. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IMPACTS IN THE PLANNING AND- PERMITTING PROCESS HE'S BEFORE THE WATER BOARD. AND SO BASICALLY WHAT SECTION THREE WOULD DO CURRENTLY IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THE WATER BOARDS TO CONSIDER AND MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IMPACTS. EARLY IN THE WATER ANDWATER PROJECT PLANNING PROCESS SEES WHICH- THE LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR ON WORKING ON THIS. EXTRA WHICH PROJECTS THAT WOULD APPLY TO- THERE'S A CONCERN THAT WOULD CREATE OVERLAP WITH SYKORA IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF ANALYSIS AND MITIGATION THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED- AND- THEN AS WE ALL KNOW WHAT SEQUENCE SOMETIMES. ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WITH PROJECT AWAY- SECTION FOR CREATES SEVERAL NEW POSITIONS WITHIN THE WATER BOARDS AND SEVERAL NEW PROGRAMS. AND AGAIN CURRENTLY IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS WILL BE FUNDED- AND PRESENTS THE RISK THAT PERMIT FEES WOULD BE INCREASED TO COVER THIS NEW PROGRAM BUT- AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING ON TRYING TO CLEAR UP THESE TO- CONCERNS AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY PRODUCTIVELY. AND I DEFINITELY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE DISCUSSIONS. WITH THE OFFER OF A SPONSOR. BEING YOU. SIR ANY I'M UP. IN THE ROOM. TO BETTER MY SHARE OF MY MONICA BE HAPPY HEALTHY THE BILL AND TO TRADES COUNCIL WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF ON A MINOR AMENDMENT.

MR WARD THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I THINK IT IS- IN CENTRAL THAT WE ENSURE THAT REPRESENTATION AS A PART OF BUT THESE BOARDS AT THE STATE AND REGIONAL LEVEL- AND TO THE ISSUES THAT- ARE. BEING WORKED OUT- YOU KNOW AGREE THAT WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS SOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WORTHY HERE TO REALLY DIG INTO ON THE DETAILS THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET RIGHT AS WELL- TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DUPLICATION WAS HE CLUTCHES FOR. YOUR PROCESSING TIME AND FOR THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- WE DON'T WANT TO ADD TO THAT BURDEN AS WELL SOUNDS- WONDERFUL THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON THOSE AS WELL AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR HERE FOR ALL THE SOLUTIONS. A HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL MADAM CHAIR AND- WILL LOOK TOWARDS SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THE WORK I WANT TO THANK. THE OPPOSITION FOR COMING IN WITH AN OPEN MIND TO GET TO GUESS AND FINDING A COMMON GROUND. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS WITH WITH THE OUR WATER ACTS OUT THERE BUT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND CONTINUE TO BE LEFT BEHIND INTO LAW THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. PART OF THAT PROCESS IS ENSURING WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND ARE ABLE TO GUIDE THAT DECISION MAKING IN A WAY THAT'S EQUITABLE FOR FAR COMMUNITIES ARE MOURNS MARGINALIZED MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE. A LIVE- MY DISTRICT IS WHICH BETWEEN THE SAME GABLE RIVERBED AND THE L. A. RIVER BED AND WHEN I SAY THAT I ME TELL YOU THAT IT'S TO THE POINT TO CONCRETE WITH A LOT OF TOXICS. OUT THERE IT'S NOT A IT'S AT THE RIVER THAT'S BEEN PAVED OVER OUT THERE AND IT IS ONE OF OUR ONLY LAST OPEN SPACES OUT THERE AND SO- THE WORK THAT MYSTERY THIS IS BEEN DOING WITH THIS PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THEY THAT REVERSIBILITY IN SPACE. THAT'S SAFE FOR US TO USE AND SO HOT THANK YOU FOR THE WORK AND I THINK YOU. TO EVERYONE FOR FINDING THE COMMON GROUND. IT'S SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THIS RIVAS JUST A SOME OF THE COM MADE BY THE AND YOUR PLAN OF ON THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES PLEASE. SURE IN SOLVER TO MISTER BOFFO. A OF YOU KNOW. THE TECHO OUT THE TECH TO ASPECTS OF KNOW- WE'VE- WE'VE ENGAGED THE OPPOSITION CERTAINLY AS YOU OVER SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE MADE BY SOME NUMBER WARD. WE WANNA GET THIS RIGHT NOW BUT AT THE END IT YET YOU KNOW THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THE WATER AGENCIES TO. YOU KNOW- DO A BETTER JOB IN- ADDRESSING THESE LONG STANDING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS- BUT CERTAINLY- MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE- AND SO CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S- OUR GOAL BUT AT SAME TIME UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ARE VERY REAL CONCERNS AND WE WANT TO. ENSURE THAT THAT- WE'RE ADDRESSING pAMENDMENTS TO FOR THAT WE GET IT RIGHT WITH POWER. THANK YOU. SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD- THE SPECIFIC AREA YOU WANT ME TO DRILL IN ON- BUTTON JUST REAL FAST THERE'S THIS THE TWO SECTIONS ON STATE AND REGIONAL BOARD- APPOINTMENTS- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LANGUAGE ONE TO ASSURE THAT THE AGRICULTURAL SEAT ISN'T THE SAME AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SEE AND THIS IS WORKING WITH FARM BUREAU AND ALL THE FOLKS TO MAKE SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE TO TAKE AND THEN AS MISS CAP HE SAID WERE ALSO WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE EGR TRIBALS HE DOESN'T HOLD UP A QUORUM OF PARTICULAR FOR REGIONAL BOARDS AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL WE DON'T WANT TO SEE BOARD WITHOUT QUORUMS AND SO WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO BE EXPLORING THAT AND MAKING SURE YOU HAVE A MINUTE THERE I'M ON THE ISSUE ABOUT THE SEQUEL STOP REAL QUICK TO DRILL N ON WHAT WE'RE VISION WHAT THE INTENT WAS- THERE THERE'S ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE TWO SECTIONS ONE SECTION ISGONNA BE SPUR STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL PERMITS AND THE IDEA IS REALLY JUST AROUND TRANSPARENCY AND SO THE WAY WE ENVISION IT IS. A SIMPLE PARAGRAPH OR TWO IN IN IN THEIR STAFF REPORT WHAT WE WANT THAT PARAGRAPH TO DO IS ONE IDENTIFY THE TRADE OFFS IN THE APARTMENT OR POLICY SO FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE WE'RE NOT REQUIRING MONITORING EVERYWHERE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO PUT MORE ENERGY INTO ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE WATER QUALITY RIGHT THERE'S TRADE OFFS- SO IDENTIFY THOSE TRADE OFFS AND THEN IDENTIFY WAYS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT THOSE TRADE OFFS HAVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE OR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. BOB IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY OF THOSE TO NECESSARILY- HE PUT INTO THE PERMANENT POLICY BUT WE WANT TO CISION MAKERS TO KNOW HOW THEY CAN REDUCE THOSE IMPACTS AND THEN SIMILARLY FOR INDIVIDUAL PERMITS LOCAL PERMITS WE THERE'S A LOT OUT THERE WE DON'T WANT EVERY PERMIT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS TO WEAR TRIMMING IT DOWN. NARROWING IT DOWN TO JUST THOSE INDIVIDUAL PERMITS ARE GETTING SOME TYPE OF EXEMPTION A TIME SCHEDULE ORDER THAT EXTENDS OUT THE COMPLIANCE DATE A WATER QUALITYVARIANTS THAT CHANGES THE STANDARD FOR PERMITTING ONLY THOSE FOLKS WOULD GET THIS ANALYSIS AND THE WAY WE ENVISION IS IT WOULD BE A FINDING AND THE FINDING WOULD AGAIN SAY WHAT THE TRADE OFF IS THE TIME SCHEDULE EXTENSION AND THEN SAY THIS MAY. IMPACT ON THE COULD. THE COMMUNITY THAT'S IT'S BEEN DO. INTO AGAIN NOTHING'S BEING REQUIRED FOR. JUST AT THE- FINDINGS BE THEY- SO THAT THE DECISION. KNOWS WHAT TRY OFFS ARE BE MADE BY. THAT'S THE KEY AND SO WE'RE TAKING OUT ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LAND YOU SEE WILL LIKE IT'S JUST WHAT THE WATER BOARD'S AUTHORITIES ABOUT- AND THEN LASTLY I. ALREADY WENT OVER THE LIMIT BUT ON THE COST. PART OF IT- AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO. PUT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT RAISING PERMITS FEES. AND THEN THERE'S A PROVISION IN THERE ABOUT A HARDSHIP STIPEND- WE HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER- LEGISLATION TWENTY ONE THIRTEEN. THAT LOOKS AT TAKING MONEY FROM. OTHER STATE WATER BOARDS ENFORCEMENT. FUND TO HELP FUND- THAT HARDSHIP FUND FOR THIRD PARTIES TO BE ABLE TO. LANGUAGE ACCESS BARRIER ISSUES- NOT HAVE COMPUTER ACCESS OR WIFI ACCESS WHATEVER THE BARRIER IS FOR THAT COMMUNITY IT'S NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN REGULATORY PROCESS. THAT FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM SO THAT THEY COULD BE. AVAILABLE SO THAT'S THAT'S THE KEY. MOST ASK THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT FURTHER EXPLANATION. ANY OTHER MEMBERS. QUESTION THIS REGULAR. IF THE REST OF THE ISSUE IS REALLY MORE ABOUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE MET OUR FINDINGS ARE MET WHY THE EXTRA ADDED COMPONENTS WHY HAVE THE EXTRA SEATS AT THE TABLE IF YOU REALLY JUST WANT THOSE ISSUES. ADDRESSED WHAT DO YOU NEED THE EXTRA. WELL I. MEAN I THINK THE HEART OF THE BILL IS THE REPRESENTATION- AT YOU KNOW AT THIS IS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF REPRESENTATION ON THESE BOARDS IN THE PAST WE FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THESE WATER BODIES ASIANS DO HAVE REPRESENTATION THERE SO I THINK THAT'S- THE KEY IN THE HEART OF THE BILL- THE PERMANENT NOW WITH THE SECTION IS. SOMEWHAT SEPARATE- BUT REALLY THE INTENT THERE IS AGAIN JUST TO HAVE THE DECISION MAKERS KNOW WHAT THE MAKING A DECISION ON WHAT ARE THE TRADEOFFS WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS TO THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THEY CAN AUTHORIZE THAT NOTHING'S PREVENTING THEM FROM NOT AUTHORIZING IT WE JUST WANT THEM TO KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE AUTHORIZES. OKAY. FRIEDMAN SURE I SOMEONE WHO SAT ON A WATER BOARD FOR SEVEN YEARS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THAT REPRESENTATION IS KEY AND THESE DECISIONS- INVOLVING WATER ARE HUGE AND HUGELY HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY HAVE A VOICE BUT HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN ACT AS THAT BRIDGE TO GO BACK TO THEM AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHY AND THAT OFTEN IS LACKING IS THE REASON I WENT ON THE WATER BOARD OF FOR ME AND MY COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE WHO IS ROUTINELY UPDATING THE PUBLIC. ABOUT THOSE VERY IMPACTFUL DECISIONS SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AND I'M- VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. A MEASURE NUMBER NUMBER ONE- I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR COMING FORWARD WITH THIS- AND- I'D LIKE TO BE LISTED AS A CO SPONSOR- AS IT MOVES FORWARD- TO WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS- I SERVED ON GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY I HAD. A LOT OF INTERACTIONS WITH THE- ARE ROUGH. WATER BOARD DEBT DOWN THE LOS ANGELES AREA CENTER. AND I'M NOT ARE ALL WORRIED ABOUT- THIS ONE REPRESENTATIVE- SOMEHOW OVERWHELMING THE DIRECTION THAT. THERE IS CERTAINLY VERY STRONG REPRESENTATION BY- ALL THE WATER INTEREST- AND- SO I THINK THIS TO SUGGEST AS A HEALTHY. AND APPROPRIATE- BALANCING- THAT- IT RECOGNIZES TOO MANY TIMES WE SIMPLY OVERLOOKED TO THOSE COMMUNITIES- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THREE OF US WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THE QUESTIONS IN THE DISCUSSION AND RESPECT FAST WHEN I. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND THANK. THANK YOU. CALDERON THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROACH DOLLY DALI NOT VOTING NAZARIAN SENATE BENNETT I BIGELOW BIGELOW NOW FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA GARCIA I KALRA LEVINE MURATSUCHI NO ONE. RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS SALAS I SMITH. SMITH NOVIA PUTRA WARD WARD I. THANK YOU. MISTER BLOOM. GOOD MORNING MADAM VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN WHICH REQUIRES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ESTABLISH A WATER LAW TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR JUDGES AND ALLOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO ASSIGN COMPLEX WATER CASES TO TRAIN JUDGES IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE JUDGES WITH EXPERT RESOURCES DEVELOPED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ASSESS TRIAL JUDGES IN ADJUDICATING THESE COMPLEX CASES. I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL ANOTHER RECORD BREAKING DROUGHT CONFLICTS OVER WATER HAVE INCREASED AND THE LITIGATION RESULTING FROM THESE CONFLICTS. IS FREQUENTLY OF A COMPLEX NATURE REQUIRING EXPERTISE AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO RESOLVE AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN OFFERS A DYNAMIC. APPROACH TO DELIVER THE CRITICALLY NEEDED TRAINING AND RESOURCES TO ASSIST JUDGES ACROSS THE STATE IN RESOLVING THESE CONFLICTS. EFFECTIVELY I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY RYAN DESERVE A SHAREHOLDER IN THE LAW FIRM OF BARKER WHAT'S CHRONIC AND SHANAHAN IN SACRAMENTO. WHOSE PRACTICE WATER LAW IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. WILL BE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE THIRTEEN. THANK YOU. KITCO HAVE MISPERCEPTIONS I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES LIVE- PRACTICE WATER LAWS VARIETY VARIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND WHAT YOU SEE IN MANY OF THESE WATER CASES. IS ESSENTIALLY THREE CROSSCUTTING COMPLEXITIES THAT MAKE THEM VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH WITHIN THE OURTS. ON THE FIRST IS THAT THEY TEND TO HAVE MANY MANY PARTIES. AND SOMETIMES THEY'RE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND SO YOU HAVE LAWSUITS GET FILED IN MULTIPLE COUNTY SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WITH HUNDREDS OF PARTIES. THE SECOND IS THAT THEY TEND TO BE EXTREMELY TECHNICAL SO YOU HAVE A- GREAT DEAL OF EXPERTISE- TESTIMONY AND MANY OF THE CASES AND EVEN IN THE CASES COMING OUT OF THE WATER BOARD- WHERE YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD THE ISSUES TEND TO BE QUITE TECHNICAL. AND THEN- THIRD THEY TEND TO BE VERY DOCUMENT HEAVY EVEN IF IT EVEN IF IT IS A WATER BOARD MATTER WITHIN ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD- THE RECORD TENDS TO BE VERY LARGE. AND SO YOU YOU HAVE A VERY COMPLEX MANAGEMENT PROBLEM FOR THE COURTS AND- HAVING AND- A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THE JUDGES AND THE POTENTIAL SILENCE TO THE TRAINING JUDGES I THINK WE MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN HELPING THESE CASES. WHICH CAN AFFECT THE ENTIRE REGIONS- MOVE. FORWARD EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SIR ANY OTHER WAY. AND SOME IN THE ROOM TODAY.

YES YEAH RIGHT- SO I GOT LIKE I'D LIKE TO MOVE MAYBE YES- LET'S TRYING TO PUT MYSELF ON OF IT IS AT A GENERAL I- OKAY SO MY NAME IS CONNOR UNDERGROUND ADVISOR WITH UNIVERSITY CAL CAR EXTENT THAT'S A WERE HOUSE I AG AND NATURAL RESOURCES SO YOU SEE A AND R. AND YEAH I THEY THEY JUST NEED I'M TALKING BIT ABOUT THE PRO HERE I THINK OF THE MAIN THAT I HAD ABOUT IT WHEN I READ OVER THE BILL WAS THAT IT DOES MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW WE ARE WE DO FACE A LOT OF. WE FREQUENTLY FACE DROUGHTS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT FOR OUR GIRLS TO BE ABLE TO BE QUICK ON THEIR FEET AND REACT TO THAT- AND THIS FOR YOU KNOW HAVING THIS THAT THE FUNDING KIND OF ON A ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS WOULD. HELP ENSURE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT. RICE FARMERS. GROWERS YOU KNOW. GRAIN GROWERS CAN- TO. THEM DURING IN SEASON THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO CONSERVE OR MOVE WATER WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE MOVED- AND HAVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHAT SWEET IS KIND OF BUILT TO DO- IT WOULD. WOULD IMPROVE THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB- AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU KNOW I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORKING WITH SOME OF THE COMMUNITY EDUCATION SPECIALISTS WHO WERE FUNDED. BY THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. IS KIND OF A SISTER PROGRAM. THEY'RE ALSO THEY'RE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT. THEY BE TALKING TO FARMERS AND LOSING INTEREST IN FARMERS NOT WANTED UNNECESSARILY. SET UP APPLICATIONS GET EVERYTHING READY FOR THE NEXT CYCLE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS GOING TO GET FUNDED AGAIN- SO IT'S KIND A LOT OF. WASTED EFFORT. IN PEACE. WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO DO THIS- THAT I THINK IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY THAT. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOW IN. THAT WE ALL KIND OF ACCEPT THAT WE'RE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. AS LIKE A- PERMANENT FIXTURE. AND GOES AND FRANKLY FROM A CROP PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THAT. THAT EXIST WITHIN A SEASON. SO THIS YEAR WE HAD TWO MAJOR DOWNFALL- DOWNPOURS AND IN BETWEEN THAT IT WAS NOTHING. AND SO THEIR STRESS INVOLVED AND HAVING MORE INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOWS FOR CROSS CONFLICTS WITH THAT. I THINK IT'S JUST A VALUABLE TOOL FOR THEM HAVING A TOOL BELT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN THE ROOM- NO WHICH MIGHT BE FOLKS ON THE TELEPHONE ON TO THE- IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIC HARRIS I AM THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- WE ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE A BILL THAT WOULD GRANT. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT ANY GRANT FOR UP FOR- PARKS WORD- HAVE TO HAVE ACCESSIBLE PARKS- DISABLED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ESPECIALLY DISABLED CHILDREN DESERVE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO LIVE THEIR LIVES HOW THEY CHOOSE. THIS SHOULD INCLUDE BEING ABLE TO ENJOY ACCESSIBLE PARKS MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS HAVE STATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR SOME DISABLED CHILDREN CAN BE VITAL FOR THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. IN SOME CASES CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES MUST HAVE REGULAR OUTDOOR ACTIVITY BECAUSE IT IS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ACTUALLY 13% OF CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS HAVE DISABILITIES AND THESE CHILDREN HAVE MOBILITY SENSORY INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND IT IS CRUCIAL THAT CALIFORNIA CONSIDER. THESE CHILDREN AS IT CONTINUES TO IMPROVE AND PROVIDE FUNDING- AND IT'S DEVELOPMENT FOR PARKS MANY PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES HAVE TO SEARCH WITHIN THEIR CITIES OR IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS TO FIND ACCESSIBLE PARKS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. AFTER MANY PARKS HAVE NOT BEEN RENOVATED IN DECADES SOME CITIES ARE BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT AND WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS HOW PARKS CAN BE MORE ACCESSIBLE. AS CITIES BECOME MORE MODERN IT IS CRUCIAL THAT OUR POLICYMAKERS AND LEADERS URGE THEM TO BE MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL PEOPLE WITH ALL THIS TYPES OF DISABILITIES I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TWO QUICK POINTS ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY. ANYBODY CAN DEVELOP A DISABILITY AT ANY TIME ANYONE CAN DEVELOP A MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITY BECOME INJURED AND AS WE KNOW AS WE AGE WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO HEAR OR OR SEE CLEARLY.

I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE TO YOU TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE UPDATES THE TEMPORARY WATER TRANSFER PROCESS BY UPDATING NOTICING REQUIREMENTS STREAMLINING THE PUBLIC'S ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. AND BY PROVIDING THE WATER BOARD A BETTER PICTURE OF THE TRANSFERS TO COMMENT IN A GIVEN WATER YEAR ESTABLISHED. IN THE WATER TRANSFER PROCESS WAS PASSED OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO AND MINIMAL UPDATES HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THEN. OUR MODELING OF HYDROLOGY IS EVOLVING AND SO IS HOW THE PUBLIC ENGAGES IN STATE PROCESS THESE. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED UPDATES TO THE TEMPORARY WATER TRANSFER PROCESS WHILE PROVIDING THE WATER BOARD THE FOR NEEDED TO PLANET STAFFING NEEDS FOR THE WATER YEAR. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CHARLES DELGADO POLICY DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SAID THAT MANAGE CHARLES TOOK OUT A POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION A SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON BRINGING TOGETHER BUSINESSES LANDOWNERS COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO MEET THE WATER NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE AND ECONOMY FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. IN SEEKING OUT COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ADVANCING SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT AND ACCELERATING THE STEWARDSHIP OF NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AND WATERWAYS AND I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER DR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA. CALIFORNIA IS ONCE AGAIN EXPERIENCING A PROLONGED DROUGHT YOU MUST RECKON WITH HOW TO BEST MANAGER VALUABLE WATER RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURE COMMUNITIES A NATURAL HABITATS. IN ADDITION TO INCREASINGLY FREQUENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS ARE STATEMENT ALSO ADAPT TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OUR WATER SUPPLIES. TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE WE MUST DEVELOP TOOLS AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW WATER MANAGERS TO ADAPT FROM RELIANCE ON THE RELATIVELY PREDICTABLE RAINFALL AND RUNOFF PATTERNS OF PRIOR DECADES. TO CAPTURING WATER WHEREVER AND WHENEVER FEASIBLE AND MOVING SUPPLIES TO WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED WHETHER FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS IRRIGATION ARE RECHARGING DEPLETED AQUIFER IS. THIS BILL IS A STEP FORWARD BUILDING THE WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE WOULD STREAMLINE THE WATER TRANSFER PETITION REVIEW PROCESS BY MODERNIZING THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFERS. ENCOURAGING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN STATE PERMITTING AGENCIES ENABLING BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN TRANSFERRING PARTIES AND GIVING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE FLEXIBILITY IT NEEDS TO REVIEW WATER TRANSFER APPLICATIONS IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT MANNER. IMPORTANTLY THIS BILL CONTINUES TO ALLOW THE BOARD TO APPLY ITS EXPERTISE AND AUTHORITY IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PREVENT ANY POTENTIAL ABUSES OF THE WATER TRANSFER SYSTEM MAY RESULT IN INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR STAKEHOLDERS. AND ENSURE THE RIGHTS OF DOWNSTREAM USERS WHILE REDUCING THE REGULATORY BURDEN FOR BENEFICIAL TRANSFERS THAT CAN BE USED FOR DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES MULTI BENEFIT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROJECTS HABITAT RESTORATION PRESERVATION OF OUR AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND ALL OTHER USES. THERE'S MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO ENSURE THAT WE GIVE WATER MANAGERS AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS THE TOOLS TO MAKE THE WISEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY FIVE THE MAKING SMART CHANGES TO THE WATER TRANSFER SYSTEM TO ENABLE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR WATER SUPPLIES IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL SIGNAL THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO ADAPTING TO THE CHANGING WATER ENVIRONMENT THAT WE LIVE IN. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST HER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OTHER SUB. IN THE ROOM.

BIGELOW NOT VOTING FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN AYE GARCIA AYE GARCIA AYE KALRA KALRA HI LEVINE MR MERRY SUCI WHEN RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS. SALAS I SMITH SMITH NOT VOTING VEHICLE ONE THE VALLAPUDUA I. WARD WARD I. THANK YOU WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. TWO BILLS. RIGHT. YEAH. THIS IS A MORE. YEAH. AFTER. WE'LL START WITH TWO TWO ZERO ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS AND WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL BOB THIS IS I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR US IN CALIFORNIA IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. FOR ME AS A LEGISLATOR WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE ISSUE OF WATER AND GETS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY ONE OF US HERE TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER AND TRY TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT. OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL HAS SIMPLY MISREPRESENTED WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IF YOU READ THE LETTER IN OPPOSITION IT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSES ON THE FACT THAT THIS TAKES LOCAL CONTROL AWAY. AND SOMEHOW IMPLIES IT GOES TO THE STATE. AND THAT'S JUST A MISREPRESENTATION AND SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE STILL UNDECIDED ABOUT THIS BILL I HOPE YOU WOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER. THAT THERE IS A AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE WHO. EXTRACT WATER- UP TO UP ALWAYS OPPOSE ANYTHING THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THESE IN IMPORTANT OVER DRAFTED AQUIFER'S. BUT IN THIS SITUATION WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH CIGNA TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND WE SIMPLY HAVE ONE. AREA WHERE WE HAVE A PROBLEM. THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES ARE IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO GET THE BASINS INTO SUSTAINABLE YIELD AND YET THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO. DEAL WITH THE NEW WELLS THAT ARE GOING IN SO YOU HAVE THOUSANDS IN CALIFORNIA THOUSANDS OF NEW WELLS GOING IN AT THE SAME TIME THAT A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY IS TRYING TO GET THAT BASIN AND SO THIS BILL DOES JUST ONE SIMPLE THING COMMITTEE STAFF IN THEIR ANALYSIS SAID WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. AND THAT IS WE HAVE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THOSE WHO ARE MANAGING THE BASIN FOR SUSTAINABLE YIELD. OKAY AND THOSE WHO ARE APPROVING THE SINKING OF THE NEWWELLS AT THE SAME TIME YOU CUTE YOU JUST IT JUST MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT APPROPRIATELY DO THE WORK. AND SO ALL THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAY THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY NEEDS TO BE. CHECKED IN WITH AND I HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT THE AQUA REPRESENTATIVES HAD SOME GOOD POINTS AND ARE AMENDMENTS HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THEIR ISSUES IN TERMS OF NOT HAVING THIS BE DUPLICATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROCESS OF NOT HAVING THIS BE OVERLY BURDENSOME ON THE G. S. H. SO WE'VE STREAMLINED THAT DOWN. WE'RE SENSUALLY CODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S- THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER- WERE CLEANING UP SOME OF THOSE DETAILS AS WE DO IT BUT I IMPLORE YOU WHILE WE'RE WORKING ON THIS PLEASE LET THIS MOVE FORWARD SO THAT WE AS A STATE LEGISLATURE CAN DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH IS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN GROUNDWATER WELL. APPROVALS AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY AND WITH ME HERE TODAY- TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL IS KYLE JONES FROM THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. I THINK MORNING KYLE JONES COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND SO OF THIS BILL AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE- THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND WE RECOGNIZE IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONNECT AND CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN LAND USE PERMITTING DECISIONS. AND SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT IN ORDER FOR SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT TO SUCCEED AT A STOP APPROACH TO THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW WELLS NEXT TO COMMUNITY WELLS NEXT TO DOMESTIC WELLS AN EXTRA CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS TRYING TO FIND A WAY FORWARD AND CODIFYING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND GIVING THE LEGISLATURE CHANCE TO SHAPE HOW THAT. EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL PLAY OUT AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE FEEDBACK THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM ON THE GROUND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS FEEL LEGISLATION. THERE'S BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX FOUR YEARS THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS GOIG TO BE A DROUGHT EMERGENCY GOING FORWARD AND IT'S GOING TO BE FREE POINT- WE CAN EXPECT EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO CONTINUE AND I THINK IT'S- BETTER THAT WE FIND A WORKABLE SOLUTION THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. RATHER THAN RELYING ON EMERGENCY ORDERS. EVERYBODY OR SO- WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT I'M HERE FOR ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. ENTERED DRIVE WHICH DAY AND WOULD LIKE TO YIELD FIRST MY TIME BELIEVE ANOTHER WITNESS ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU WE HAVE ROUTE MARTINEZ SO ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU OPERATOR. A MOMENT. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU. YES MY NAME IS RICK MARTINEZ AND I'VE BEEN A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE DIFFICULT COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT FOR SEVERAL YEARS I AM CALLING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THAT AB TWENTY TWO ZERO ONE TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR WATER JUSTICE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS OF LEGAL WORK ALONGSIDE PETER JARVIS. DURING THE FARMWORKER MOVEMENT FOR CLEAN WATER I DO HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. BECAUSE OF LAW COMMUNITY INTO GREAT COUNTY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE WHERE MOST THIRD. FARMWORKERS FOR DECADES OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN NEGLECTED THAT WE'VE SUFFERED FROM BY JAKE CONTAMINATION ISSUES FOR THE YEARS THAT MEANT WE COULDN'T USE OUR WATER COMING OUT OF THE- GAP. DO CORD LIKE MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS BEEN. I HAD TO RELY ON COSTLY BOTTLED WATER FOR EVERYDAY TASKS LIKE COOKING DRINKING SO THAT OUR FAMILY MEMBERS. DON'T HAVE A HAVE THAT YOU. QUARTERLY INTO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE WILL LEVERAGE A ONE POINT MILLION DOLLARS THANK GOD AND GRILLED REPLACE COMING WELL PROVIDE STATE WATER FOR MYSELF AND MYNEIGHBORHOOD FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS. THE LAST YEAR THE BRAND NEW COMMUNITY GOING TO WONDER WELL WOULD. MAKE BUT IN THE END BASIN INCREASED RISK OF BREAKING. NEWS HAS BECOME. THIS IS BECAUSE THE AGRICULTURE WHILE THAT WAS PROVIDED PERMITTED TO BE DRUG ACROSS THE STREET. DO IT NOW. NEARBY IDENTICAL DEPT LAST SUMMER. THE COUNTY APPROVED THIS NEW WELL WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY NOT ONLY REQUIRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE. SET BACK WHICH HAS FAILED PROTECT. NICHOLAS THAT WE DON'T KNOW OF THE GIVEN TO US THE NEW WHAT WITH DRILLED AND NO PROSPECT X. AT FOR A TWO. ON THE WELL PREVENT. WE WHERE WERE THAT SHARED A HOLIDAY AREA THE NEW WOULD DIRECTLY THAT ARE WHY SUPPLY. AN INCREASE IN THAT. OF OCT. AS A MEMBER OF THE CULT OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT BOARD I AM GETTING MANY CALLS. AND CONCERNS ASSEMBLY. THAT THE DECREE. AND THE LACK OF WATER COMING FROM MY CAPS.

CHAU BOTTERILL OF ON BEHALF OF COMPANY BECAUSE COMPLIANCE AND A TEN CALIFORNIA KEEPERS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MOVED OPPOSITION IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. I'M SORRY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BOB REAP WITH THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TESTIFYING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE VALLEY I WATER COALITION AND SOLANO COUNTY WATER AGENCY. THE VALUE ADD WATER COALITION CONSISTS OF FORTY THREE WATER DISTRICTS JUST DITCH COMPANIES MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE WATER TO FARMS THROUGHOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. EVERYONE OF OUR MEMBERS AS A MEMBER OF A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL COMPLETELY UNDERCUTS LOCAL CONTROL THE KEY TENETS UNDERPINNING THE ENTIRETY OF SIGMA. THE BILL IMPOSES SEVERAL NEWMANDATES AND FOR THE RECORD MADAM CHAIR THE COMMITTEE IS BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON A BILL TODAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE ALL WE HAVE ARE BULLETS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO REALLY SPEAK TO THE- TO THE BILL. WHEN WE JUST HAVE BULLET POINTS BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY- ACCORDING TO ANALYSIS THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE A COUNTY TO OBTAIN WRITTEN VERIFICATION FROM THE GSA BEFORE ISSUES A PERMIT FOR A NEW WELL. OR NOT TO RESCIND EXISTING WELL. THIS WILL OVERRIDE COUNTY ORDINANCES BASED ON MINISTERIAL APPROVAL OF WELL PERMIT APPLICATIONS. AND LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH INVOLVED ZERO STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION IT WILL LEAD TO ONE OF THREE OUTCOMES. NO NEW WELLS INCREASE LITIGATION OR A FULL SEQUEL ANALYSIS FOR EVERY WELL PERMIT APPLICATION. SECOND THE BILL REQUIRES A GSA TO DETERMINE THAT A NEW OR ALTERED WELL WILL NOT IMPACT OTHER NEARBY WELLS OR CAUSE SUBSIDENCE THAT IMPACTS NEARBY INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS IS DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS. AND THIS REQUIREMENT GOES FAR BEYOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGMA ALREADY AUTHORIZES THE GSA TO IMPOSE SPACE REQUIREMENTS ON NEW WELLS TO MINIMIZE WELL IN FOR INTERFERENCE. IT AUTHORIZES GSA'S CONTROL GROUNDWATER EXTRACTIONS AND AUTHORIZES GSA'S THE CONSTRUCTION TO REGULATE THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW WELLS. THIRD THIS BILL REQUIRES A GSA TO ALLOW FOR A THIRTY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD BEFORE MAKING A DETERMINATION ABOUT A PROPOSED WELL. IN RENDERING DE FACTO ALL PERMIT APPLICATIONS AS DISCRETIONARY THIS BILL WILL ADD NEW DUPLICATIVE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS OF THOSE ALREADY ESTABLISHED UNDER SYKORA. FINALLY THIS BILL APPLIES ITS MANDATES TO ALL MEDIUM AND HIGH PRIORITY BASINS RATHER THAN JUST BASS AND SUBJECT CRITICAL OVER DRAFT. SIGNATURE EATS BASIN SUBJECT TO CRITICAL OVER DRAFTED DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER MEDIUM OR HIGH PRIORITY BASINS THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE BEING SUSTAINABLY MANAGED. THE BASIS FOR DESIGNATING BASINS IS MORE ABOUT POPULATION IN THE RELATIVE RELIANCE ON GROUNDWATER'S FOR SUPPLY. PLUS THIS LEGISLATION WOULD APPLY TO JUDICATA BASINS WHICH CONFLICTS WITH THEIR TREATMENT UNDER SIGMA FOR THESE REASONS WE- STRONGLY ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M BRENDA BASS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY TWO R. ONE. AB TWENTY TWO OH ONE WOULD CREATE A NEW PERMITTING REGIME FOR GROUNDWATER WELLS THAT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES THE PEOPLE IN OTHER BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON A THRIVING AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY BANK ECONOMY FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS. AND ON FOOD SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA THE BILL IMPOSES STRICT NEW MANDATES ON HOW GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES OR GSA'S- MUST OPERATE AND MANAGE THEIR OWN GROUNDWATER BASINS THIS IS AT ODDS WITH THE POLICY WILL GOALS OF SICK NOT WHICH FOCUS ON LOCAL CONTROL. SIGNALED ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NOT EVERY GROUNDWATER BASINS THE SAME AND THAT NEW SINGLE MANAGEMENT SOLUTION IS THE RIGHT FIT FOR EVERY BASIN. AB TWENTY TWO R. ONE DOES NOT AFFORD GSA'S THE NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY TO TAILOR MANAGEMENT TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. SIGMA IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL SIGMA IS ANTICIPATED TO RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING OF UP TO ONE MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES WHICH WERE ONCE WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS AND COST BILLIONS IN LOST FIRM REVENUE. THIS WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THESE IMPACTS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AGRICULTURE IS THE MAIN ECONOMIC DRIVER. WITH MANY INDUSTRIES AND JOBS TIED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO FARMING SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION. FINANCE AND MORE. ADDITIONALLY CAL AGRICULTURE PROVIDES NECESSARY FOOD SUPPLIES TO THE STATE AND THE REST OF THE NATION. AT A TIME WHEN PRICES ARE RACING ARE RISING DUE TO INFLATION AND SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES ARE ESSENTIALLY UNAVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE. FURTHER LIMITING THE SUPPLY WATER SUPPLY FOR CROPS MEANS THAT CALIFORNIANS MAY HAVE AN EVEN HARDER TIME ACCESSING AFFORDABLE AND HEALTHY FRUITS ANDVEGETABLES. WELL THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY THE COMMITTEE WAITED NEAR THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER THE KEY DIFFERENCES AND PERMANENCE WE SHOULD WORK THROUGH THE BEST WAYS TO ACHIEVE WHAT THE DIRECTIVES IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BEFORE CODIFYING AN APPROACH. AND MODIFYING THE LOCAL CONTROL GUARANTEED AND CIGNA THIS IS JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE SPELL. THANK YOU. SIR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- DANNY MERKLEY DIRECTORA RESOURCES FOR- THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND- WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THIS PREMATURE MEASURE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION THE ROOM. HELP WITH.

AND I'M SURE WE HAVE NO SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS. MISTRIAL OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR PRECIADO IT TO THE AUTHOR. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT FILL IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOT FIVE CHALLENGES A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE SOME ON BOTH SIDES AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITY SAID YOU STRUGGLE WITH WATER WE HEARD ONE OF THOSE- TESTIFIES TODAY- IF YOU CAN HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE IN APPLYING THESE NEW- UNFUNDED MANDATES ACROSS THE BOARD. TO ALL MEDIUM AND HIGH PRIORITY BASINS SINCE MANY OF THESE BASINS ARE EDUCATED ALREADY THEREFORE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED- MOST OF THEM. IT SEEMS LIKE OUR SUSTAINABLE AT LEAST IT SEEMS THAT THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS SUSTAINABLE IN ARE ALREADY HAVING THE YIELDS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS TO WIPE BROADLY. CAST YOUR BILL ACROSS ALL OF THESE SUSTAINABLE DISTRICTS. VERSUS JUST FOCUSING IN ON THESE THAT HAVE SOME CHALLENGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE IT THERE ISN'T AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO CAST THIS ACROSS ALL OF THEM. IT ONLY APPLIES TO THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AREAS WHERE THERE IS A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. AND AND SO PLACES THAT ARE IN BALANCE ARE NOT PLEASE DON'T DON'T APPLY AND I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENT MADE EARLIER ADJUDICATED BASINS ARE ALSO NOT. J. JUDICATA BASINS. THIS DOESN'T- THIS DOESN'T AFFECT THE WATER MASTER TERMS OF DECISIONS OF WATER AFTER TO MAKE IT REALLY IS FOCUSED ON THE AREAS WHERE THERE IS A GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY THAT'S BEEN CREATED BY THE STATE BECAUSE THE STATE HAS A CONCERN. ABOUT THE OVERDRAFT PROBLEMS OF THAT PARTICULAR AQUIFER SO HOW DOES THIS HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THE FACT THAT UNDER SIGMA SIGMA AUTHORIZES THE GSA'S TO IMPOSE SPACING REQUIREMENTS ON A NEW WELL CONSTRUCTION- TO MINIMIZE THE WELL INHERENT. CONFLICTS THAT MAY ARISE- IT SEEMS LIKE GSA'S DUE TO THEIR WORK- WITH OFTEN ONLY ODDER ALTERING BUT THE FOCUS ON LOCAL CONTROL DOES SEEM TO BE LOST HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE WELL I AGAIN. I'M A IF YOU DON'T MIND THE TERMS OF THE RESPONSE I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S LOCAL CONTROL LOS THIS DISTRICT IS THE GSA'S ARE LOCAL SO IT'S NOT LOCAL CONTROL LOST NUMBER AUTHORIZES JUST SPACING. THAT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE- HE YOU KNOW HE IS THE WELL CONSISTENT WITH THE WITH THE GSA'S. END RIGHT NOW THE COUNTIES ARE AT A MINISTERIAL LEVEL AND MANY GSA'S HAVE HAVE. PROBABLY NOT EVEN GOTTEN AROUND TO ALL OF THOSE OTHER REQUIREMENTS THEY BEEN FOCUS ON THESE OTHER THINGS YET I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. IS SHOULD WE BE ON RECORD AS SAYING WORK WE SHOULD KEEP THESE WELLS IN THESE OVER DRAFTED BASINS THAT HAVE GSA'S CHIU WE KEEP THEM AT THE MINISTERIAL LEVEL. WHERE THE COUNTY IS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO DO- A SIGNIFICANT REVIEW THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE MINISTERIAL PROCESS WHICH MEANS NO DISCRETION NO ANALYSIS IF YOU MEET IF YOU MEET THESE TWO OR THREE REQUIREMENTS YOU GET YOUR WELCOME. THAT JUST SEEMS YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WE WERE. ONE OF THE LAST STAGE. IT THE COUNTRY T. DO ANYWAY. OF GROUND. WITH THE WIN WE DIPLOMA PASSED YESTERDAY. WE SHOULDN'T BE ONE OF THE LAST STATES THAT ALSO SAYS. WE'RE GONNA KEEP TO NEW WELLS MINISTERIAL THE APPROVED. IN A NIGHT I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SINCERITY OF THE QUESTION BECAUSE I WOULD JUST OFFER IN VENTURA COUNTY. WE ACTUALLY DID THIS WE SAID NO NEW WELLS- TEN AM IMPLICATED WE CAME UP WITH THIS. AND IT WAS BITTERLY FOUGHT. UNTIL WE DID. AND WHEN WE DID IT EVERYBODY SAID IT WAS THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED. BECAUSE THEY WERE CONCERNED THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW. ONE FARMER DID KNOW HOW TO SAY TO THE OTHER FARMER HEY AB I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD PUT THAT WELL AND- BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA FACT MY FAR. CAN THEY WERE THEY WERE SORT OF LOOKED BUT THIS JUST STAB. A FRAMEWORK WHEN WE DID THAT AND I VIEW THE OPPOSITION. COMING UNDERSTANDABLY FROM THE EXACT SAME SPOT. AND I HAVE HAD I HAD DOZENS OF AG INTERESTS COME UP TO ME AND SAY I COULDN'T SAY IT AT THE TIME. I'M REALLY GLAD YOU DID THAT BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY AFFECTING OUR ABILITY. EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SPACED IT WAS AFFECTING OUR ABILITY AND YOU YOU FIND IT LOTS OF AG INTEREST IN LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO. ARE TERRIFIED THAT TOO MANY NEW WELLS ARE GOING TO GO AROUND THEM AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THEIR ABILITY. THIS JUST SAYS GSA'S PLAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL GSA'S PLAY A LOCAL ROLE HERE IN TRYING TO HELP. DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION AND THAT'S WHY I THINK AT A MINIMUM I REQUEST GIVE US A CHANCE TO LET THE AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY COME OUT OF LEDGE COUNCIL. THEN WE CAN HAVE A- A MORE ROBUST ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL AND ALL THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN AS WE'VE TRIED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO I. I BELIEVE THAT'S A VERY. DIRECT AND SINCERE ANSWER BUT I THINK THE PROBLEMATIC ISSUE BECOMES WITH THE GSA'S AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY START UP TRUMPING LOCAL LAND RIGHTS THE OVERLYING LANDOWNER HAS A RIGHT TO THE WATER WITH. WHICH IS UNDERNEATH HIS PROP OR FOR PROPERTIES AND THAT THE THERE IN LIES THE PROBLEM THAT YOUR BILL SETS FORTH. YOU HAVE ANOTHER COUNTY MADERA I'LL JUST MENTION THAT ALREADY IN LITIGATION BECAUSE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THEIR GSA IS THEY'VE TAKEN THE OVERLYING RAIN WATER THAT FALLS ON THE LAND AND- HAVE TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FORMING ON THAT LAND. THAT THAT WAS THAT WATER THAT FELL ON THEIR LAND. THEY'RE ONLY ENTITLED TO. TEN OR AS MUCH AS 25% OF THAT WATER IS WHAT THEY CAN USE FOR THEIR LAND ALL THE REST HAVETO BE ROUTED OVER TO THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY ARE GETTING. THAT SEEMS LIKE A TO TAKING TO ME. AND I THINK THAT THAT BECOMES THE THAT HAPPENS WE THIS BILL. IT BECOMES AN EXTENSION OF THE TAKING OF WATER RIGHTS FROM ONE AND GIVEN TO ANOTHER AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS SETTING FORTH IT ALSO SETS FORTH WHAT. POTENTIALLY CAN BECOME AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM ON ACTIONS IN TIME WHILE IT MAY NOT SIGNING IT OVER THE IMMEDIATE MOMENT. OVER TIME IT WILL. IF I COULD ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. IT TWO THINGS THAT PICKED THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES. GENERALLY ARE HAVE A VERY STRONG REPRESENTATION FROM THE AG INTEREST- AND THEY'VE MADE IT ALL THE ONES THAT I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SO IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE A HOSTILE AGENCIES OUT THERE BUT WE DO WE MAKE WE HAVE AND SEE IF WE AYE WE MAY HAVE HAD AND IN SOME SITUATIONS- BUT HOLES THIS DOES IS THE GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AGENCY. HAS TO VERIFY THAT IT DOESN'T VIOLATE THE POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO TAKE AWAY WATER RIGHTS FOR EVERYBODY IT IT JUST SIMPLY HAS THAT- BUT BUT AT SOME POINT IN TIME. THAT MAY BE A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE WHICH IS MANAGED SHOULD SHOULD ALL WILL STAY MINISTERIAL. NO MATTER HOW BAD THE SITUATION GETS NO MATTER HOW MUCH NEGATIVE IMPACT IT COULD BE SHOULD DO SHOULD THE WELL STATE MINISTERIAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHT OWNER THAT IS THERE AT SOME POINT IN TIME. I WE HAVE TO SAY AT LEAST LET US HAVE THE GSA'S WAY IN END TO OFFER A PATH. THAT'S WHERE WE BACK TO THE SIGNET SITE OF IT SIGNAL WITH CERTAIN. OP FOCUS AND CONTROL OVER IMPOSING STATE MANDATES AND I THINK NOW WE'RE TRYING TO TRUMP THAT AND GIVE A LITTLE HIGHER READY TO. PRIORITY TO THE GSA SO I THINK IT IS A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD SAY BECAUSE THE GSA'S NEED THAT'S ONE THING THAT GOT MISTER GSA'S NEED THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET THE- IF THEY'RE EVER GOING TO GET THE BASIN INTO SUSTAINABILITY. THANK THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE FIVE THOUSAND NEW WELLS IN HERE OR TEN THOUSAND NEW WELLS IN THERE IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF GETTING IT INTO SUSTAIN I WOULD JUST OFFER TO THE MEMBERS. I THINK WE NEED TO LET SIGMA MAKE THAT. I DO. TYPE OF INACTION OR ACTION RULING WITHIN THEIR BODY AND THEIR THEIR- HOURS AND NOT LEAVE IT TO US HERE TODAY TO MAKE THAT DECISION AT TEN AND I WOULD OFFERED THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVES THEM THE AUTHORITY TO SAY. HEY THIS IS THE WE THINK THESE WELLS ARE PROBLEMS AT ALL THANK YOU. THIRTY OTHER MEMBERS LIKE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. FIFTY G. LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER BENNETT YET YES I WOULD AND I APPRECIATE INDULGENCES ALLOWING US TO HAVE A LEGISLATIVE BODY BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE DEBATE IS HEALTHY SO I APPRECIATE THAT FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY RESPOND TO THE ARGUMENT THAT KEEPS BEING MADE THAT THIS IS TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL THAT KEEPS BEING SAID IT WAS SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND LETTER OF OPPOSITION A RESPECTFULLY OUT OFFERS IS JUST NO EVIDENCE OF SAYING IT'S TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL IT'S ACTUALLY GIVING LOCAL CONTROL TO THE LOCAL GSA- THAT IS OUT THERE- AND AT THIS THE SECOND THING- YOU KNOW WHAT AS I AS I MENTIONED- WE HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE COMING. UP IT AS IMPORTANT AS THIS ISSUE IS IT SEEMS TO ME WE OUGHT TO- ALLOWS US TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT PEOPLE CAN TRULY ANALYZE- THE AMENDMENTS TO BILLS EXCEPT WE HAVE MANY MANY PLACES WHERE OF THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE REVIEWED AS IT MOVES FORWARD- THE FINAL TWO POINTS BOB WE SHOULD ALL CARE- AT THE END I GROUP WHICH IS GENERALLY WE SHOULD ALL CARE THAT ONE THOUSAND DOMESTIC WELLS WENT DRY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. ALONE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NOW THAT'S A- EVERYBODY SAYS I WANT TO BE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY SHOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY THOUSAND DOMESTIC WELLS THAT'S DRINKING WATER FOR PEOPLE WENT DRY IN ONE COUNTY. AND THE IT M. ANSARI IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY RIGHT NOT NOT IN MY COUNTY THANK YOU FOR THAT IN. IN THE IN THE PERSONAL QUESTION I THINK WE SHOULD ALL ASK OURSELVES IS DO YOU WANT TO BE ON RECORD AS SAYING. EVEN THOUGH THAT'S THE CASE ALL WELL PERMITS SHOULD STILL BE JUST MINISTERIAL THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING ELSE EXCEPT THE MINISTER A REVOTE REVIEW FOR NEW WELL. I JUST DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO BE ON RECORD OF THAT AND SAYING I DON'T EVEN WANT TO CONSIDER A BILL. ANYMORE AS WE GO FORWARD SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. THAT YOU ALLOW THIS BILL TO CONTINUE TO MOVE. AND ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT WITH COMMITTEE STAFF THANK- NEED TO MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK. CALL THE ROLL.

TWENTY SIX THIRTY THREE. THE BILL YES THANK YOU ARE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF MR COOLEY WHO'S OUT ILL TODAY- I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SO NOT I'M NOT JUST PRESENTING BUT I AM A- IN FULL SUPPORT- THIS IS A WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE BILL BUT IT RELATES TO. OUR PROBLEM WITH HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL- WHEN HE SAID THIS BILL TODAY WHICH WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S SPECIAL PARK LANDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FIRST BY LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF WORKING ON THIS AND ACCEPT THAT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. MANY OF CALIFORNIANS REGIONAL PARKS AND OUTDOOR SPACES PROVIDE IMPORTANT RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESIDENTS WHILE PRESERVING CRITICAL NATURAL RESOURCES AND PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE. AMENITIES OUTDOOR SPACE AS LONG REPRESENT LEVEES SUPPORT- FLOOD CONTROL AS WELL AS FISHING SPECIES AND DEGRADATION OF THESE AREAS IMPACT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPACT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY. OUT RECENTLY- WE'VE SEEN MANY INCIDENTS OF FIRES I KNOW SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU'RE IN SESSION YOU MAY HAVE SEEN FIRES THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AROUND HERE. 99% OF TIME THERE FROM THE LEVEES AROUND HERE AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE CAUSED BY UNSANCTIONED HOMELESS CAMPS A YESTERDAY IN THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SECOND BE THE SIERRA CLUB ASK THE COUNTY AND CITY IS STEP UP ENFORCEMENT OF AN- PERMITTED CAPPING THEIR WITH A DOCUMENT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX FIRES LAST YEAR. I'M AT THESE HOMELESS CAMPS- THESE STRONG WINDS PUSH THESE FIRES THROUGHOUT THESE ENCAMPMENTS AND NOT ONLY- IMPACTED VEGETATION- AND THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO POSED A RISK TO THE CAMPERS THEMSELVES. ADDRESSING THIS ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARDS IN OUR SPECIAL PARK LANDS IS CRITICAL TO PROTECTING THE LIFE SAFETY OF ALL OF OUR PARKS OUR VISITORS OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES AND ENSURING PARK SUSTAINABILITY. HI THIS BILL IS BORN OUT ABOUT OUR PARKWAY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH HAS EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE VISITED EVERY YEAR BUT REALLY IT'S ABOUT SOME OF THESE SPECIAL PARK. LANDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. LASSEN SOME WOULD SAY WERE YOU GOING TO TELL PEOPLE TO GO IF THEY ARE HOMELESS. THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES THAT YOU CAN'T CAN'T IF YOU'RE HOMELESS WE DON'T HAVE CAMPSITES ON THE STATE CAPITOL RIGHT OUTSIDE HERE. WOULD ALLOW CAMPSITES ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD THAT PRINTER HIGH SCHOOL THAT WE DON'T ALLOW CAMPSITES- UNDER HALF TO MILLION SEVENTY. WOULD ALLOW HOMELESS CAMPS ON THE BEACHES OF LAKE TAHOE WE THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES WHICH FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT PUBLIC PLACES. ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS WE SAY THE SUN NOT BE SANCTIONED A CAMPSITE SO WE REALIZE THAT WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT- THE HOMELESS WHERE TO GO. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING THESE AMENDMENTS HERE FOCUSING ON- REQUIRING THAT THE TO BE PLENTY OF NOTICE BEFORE- WE HAVE AN ACTION RELATED THESE CAMPSITES. AND MAKING SURE THE INDIVIDUALS ABOUT A PLACE FOR. SHELTER AND SAFE GROUND- WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS MORNING AND I HAVE WITH ME STEVEN GREEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN RIVER.

ON THE AMERICAN RIVER PARKWAY. IN THIS PAST YEAR. WE'VE ALREADY HAD FIRES AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND IT'S GETTING WORSE. ONE OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAPPENED. IS THAT A- HABITAT RESTORATION PROGRAM AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM AT SAC STATE UNIVERSITY. HAD BEEN UNDER WAY RIGHT THERE ON THE PARKWAY FOR FIVE YEARS. IT WAS ENTIRELY WIPED OUT BY THESE FIRES. THIS IS OVERDUE WE HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT THIS CRITICAL HABITAT THIS RECREATION AREAS THAT ARE THERE. AND I'M VERY PLEASED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY.

GET OFF THE OFFER WHAT DO I GO YOU AROUND I. REPORTER YOU CAN BE FROM THE IF YOU WITH. THIS IS A MEDICAL TERM. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. I'M HOMELESS ADVOCATE FOR THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THERE LIVING IN THE STREETS OF CITRUS HEIGHTS THAT'S PRIMARILY WHY WORK. WHEN MORE VERSUS BOISE PASSED. IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT WAS A WAY TO WHERE PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY SLEEP. AND IT'S A BIG DEAL I MEAN I GO HOME EVERY NIGHT AND I GET TO GO TO SLEEP. AND THESE PEOPLE DON'T. OKAY I FOUGHT FOR TWO WOULD HAVE FOR YEARS IN SOME INCIDENCES JUST TO GET AGENCIES TO CAPITULATE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BE THERE. I HAD TO STOP SAYING WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE THERE. AND START SAYING YOU'RE IN CONTEMPT OF COURT. WHEN I STARTED SAYING THAT. WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY YES MISTER SUCH AS THEY CAN BE HERE WE'RE SORRY IS THE REAL THING THIS IS A DO YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T JUST SOMETHING WE MADE UP. EVERY EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO CIRCUMVENT THIS LAW. UNDER RULE IT. THE VIOLATIONS AGAINST THAT RIGHT NOW BUT WHO CARES RIGHT THESE ARE JUST HOMES PEOPLE. THEREFORE. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BILL SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENTS. WELL ACCORDING TO MARTIN VERSUS BOISE. THESE ARE NOT ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENTS THIS IS JUST THEY BELIEVE IT'S A PLAY ON WORDS JUST THE DEMONIZED THOSE PEOPLE CHANGE THE WORD ILLEGAL. AND REMOVE IT FROM THERE. BECAUSE IT'S DEMONIZING PEOPLE I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF NOTHING ELSE THIS GUY HERE THAT CAME HERE TODAY BEFORE YOU. IS ASKING YOU FOR THAT JUST CHANGE THAT WORD BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU EVEN IF THIS BILL PASSES DOWN THE ROAD PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO BE DOWN THERE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SAYING NO THERE'S A FEDERAL LAW. THAT SAYS WE CAN BE HERE I GUARANTEE THAT THANK YOU PLEASE SUMMARIZE. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WANTED TO PUT A REMOVED. THE STYLES OF THE PEOPLE. IT WAS A NATURAL DISASTER YOU WOULD HAVE FEMA TRAILERS YOU WOULD HAVE PORTAPOTTIES YOU HAVE FOOD HE WOULD HAVE LOVED YOU HAVE LITTLE TEDDY BEARS. THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO GIVE THEM. IS NOTHING BUT KILL TO MONEY IT'S- IT'S A DROP IN THE BUCKET. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING THANK IF YOU COULD HOUSE ALL THOSE PEOPLE YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE IT. THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR LISTENING YES THE AND I SO MUCH I HOPE YOU VISIT THANK YOU. TO THE NEXT. HI SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARCUS DAHLE THE AND I'M THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON HOMELESSNESS AT HOUSING CALIFORNIA ON THANKS TO MISTER SANCHEZ WHO CAME THIS MORNING AFTER READING ABOUT THIS BILL AND THAT LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND DECIDE IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO RAISE HIS VOICE SO ALIVE I'M GRATEFUL FOR HIS TESTIMONY- WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PARK LANDS ARE CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS HOWEVER WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE ACLU OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND OTHERS. THAT THIS BILL THREATENS TO FURTHER CRIMINALIZE DESTABILIZE AND DISPLACED ARE MOST ECONOMICALLY DEPRIVED NEIGHBORS IN THE MIDST OF AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS A RECENT REPORT BY THE ACLU DETAILED THE WAYS IN WHICH- LOCALITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE INCREASING ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS THAT EFFECTIVELY BAN ON HOUSE PEOPLE FROM PUBLIC SPACES AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DISPLACED AND BANISHED FROM PUBLIC SPACES THAT MIGHT BE SAFER OR MORE PROXIMATE TO SERVICES BECAUSE OF LAYER UPON LAYER OF LOCAL ORDINANCES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES THAT SWEEP ENCAMPMENTS. BUT BEYOND THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMPLICATIONS WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ALSO FAIL TO ACCOMPLISH ITS STATED GOAL OF CLEARING PARKLANDS OF SO CALLED ON PERMITTED CAMPERS BECAUSE AS STATED PEOPLE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO OUR SHELTER AND HOUSING SYSTEMS ARE BEYOND CAPACITY PEOPLE WHO ENTER OUR STATE HOMELESS RESPONSE SYSTEM THROUGH THEIR LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE TYPICALLY WAIT BETWEEN NINE AND TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THEY'RE CONNECTED WITH HOUSING AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT SWEEPING ENCAMPMENTS FUNCTIONALLY MAKES HOMELESSNESS WORK WORSE. BY DESTABILIZING PEOPLE- REMOVING THEIR BELONGINGS THAT AND IDENTITY DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR TRASH CREATING CRIMINAL RECORD BARRIERS AND ROADING TRUST BETWEEN OUR OWN HOUSE NEIGHBORS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOWEVER WHAT WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING IS TO ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE PEOPLE ARE NOT FORCED TO SLEEP IN OUR SPECIAL PARKS IS THE SAME THING THAT WOULD END THEIR HOMELESSNESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SERVICES AND WHEN NECESSARY INTERIM SHELTER FACADE TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO HOUSING. LOCAL PARK DISTRICTS COULD BE EQUIPPED TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENGAGE PEOPLE THROUGH ON GOING OUT REACHING CONNECT THEM TO RESOURCES. UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT SUPPORT AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY THREE. TWELVE TWENTY SIX THIRTY THREE WHICH WE FEAR CREATES A NEW PATH TO DISPLACE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND SEEKS TO BLAME INDIVIDUALS MOST IMPACTED. BY OUR HOUSING CRISIS FOR A HOST OF SYSTEMIC ISSUES WITHOUT OFFERING REAL SOLUTIONS. THANKS FOR TIME ANYMORE- OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM. OPERATE THE SMOKE TO THE PHONE LINES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY THREE MY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT IS ONE AND THEN THEIR OFFER ANY OPPOSITION. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE NINETY YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THE SHERIN REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT TO GO TO LINE FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HELLO TO DISCUSS THE L. BEHALF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE'RE IN STRONG OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE PRIMARILY THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEXICO LINE. SIXTEEN YOUR LOOK. SENIOR US SENIOR ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL HOMELESSNESS LAWCENTER CRISTINA BOWERMAN IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU NEXT TO THE LINE EIGHTY SIX THE LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU PATTI PANICCIA BURSTING YOUR HOUSING ATTORNEY AT JUSTICE IN AGING FOR THE REASONS THAT- THE WITNESSES HAVE STATED WE OPPOSED TO SPELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME AN OBJECT THANK YOU WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THIRTY QUESTIONS. MR WARD. THANK YOU I WANT TO- THANK YOU AND MISTER COOLEY FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE I AIN'T FULLY APPRECIATE HOW DIRE THE SITUATION IS AMONGST THE RIVER HERE IN SACRAMENTO INDEED MANY OF OUR PARK LANDS ACROSS THE STATE- INCLUDING SOME IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VEXING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT HOW TO RESPONSIBLY ENGAGE AND ASSESS AND REMEDIATE- ENCAMPMENTS THAT ARE FRUSTRATING TO THOSE THAT CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND CERTAINLY PRESS WRITTEN TO THE GENERAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE- I AM ALL BALL JUMP AHEAD TO SAY THAT I DON'T FEEL THAT I'M IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I DON'T WHILE THE COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT- YOU KNOW BE INTERESTED IN ANSWERING- THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS THAT I KNOW AND WE KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN I KNOW THIS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE ARE BETTER PATHWAYS TO BE ABLE TO DO JUST THAT TO ENGAGE INDIVIDUALS TO RESOLVE HOMELESSNESS WHERE IT SAT TO HELP ASSIST THEM ON THE RIGHT PATH WAYS WE NEED DO A BETTER JOB AND THAT TOO IT DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US AND SOME OF THE IMPACTS ARE HAVING BOTH ENVIRONMENT INTO THE GENERAL COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S FRUSTRATING- I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL IS DRAFTED IS GOING TO BE- EITHER- YOU DON'T RENDER MOOT TO OR OTHERWISE ON DONE BUYING THAT FEDERAL BOISE MARTIN VERSUS BOISE DECISION- I KNOW THAT THEIR AMENDMENTS IN HERE THAT- I THINK IS DRAFTED YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO- TO CAMPERS TO BE ABLE TO PRESERVE AND STORE- PERSONAL PROPERTY- AND ALSO THAT YOU KNOW SERVICE WORKERS AND- THOSE POINTING INDIVIDUALS TOWARDS. WOULD BE AVAILABLE- TO HELP THEM- QUOTE- EVERY EFFORT SHALL BE MADE TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE AND IT SAYS IT IT'S A BIG ENOUGH THAT I'M WORRIED THAT NAY ON BOISE WILL STILL UNDO- AND A LOG WITH THIS INTENTION AS WELL. AND THEN YOU MORE BROADLY. I WONDER WHY WE WOULD EVEN NAY THE TO HAVE DOESN'T NEED OF A SPY. PART PLAN. AT ALL I THAT FOR MINE POSITION AND YOU CAN CALL ME IF I'M WRONG. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE THE PARK PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY TO- ENFORCE ORDERS. UNDER BOISE SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS BE IN PLACE THAT THERE IS A ALTERNATIVE AND POSITIVE PATHWAY TO RESOLUTIONS. SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WE EVEN NEED THESE OTHER NATIONS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY HAVE THE EMPOWER MEN IF THEY ARE DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY- SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL LIKELY BE OPPOSING THIS BILL I WELCOME- THE FEEDBACK YOU HAVE TO SOME OF THOSE POINTS BUT I. AGAIN DON'T- DISAGREEING WITH DEAN- THE INTERESTS AND- THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE YOU KNOW A HEALTHY BALANCE WITH WITH THOSE THAT THAT WANT- HEALTHY OPEN SPACES AS WELL FOR THEIR- PUBLIC ENJOYMENT. THE RESTAURANT CLOSE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS COMMENTS I'M JUST ON THE OTHER OF THE LINE WHICH IS I'M IN A I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD- BUT THE ONE AREA THAT I WOULD THE- LITTLE. RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR ON IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AUTHORS. ARE ABLE TO MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS I THINK WE HAVE A WE HAVE A HUGE CHALLENGE WITH THE WHOLE HOMELESS- SITUATION HERE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF- THE GENTLEMAN THAT THAT CAME AND JUST SO YOU KNOW THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN CHANGED. THE WORD ILLEGAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT AND IT'S BEEN CHANGED ON PERMITTED SO VIEW ACCOMPLISH AT LEAST ONE OF ONE ONE OF YOUR GOALS. BUT THAT BALANCE BETWEEN- PROTECTING OR PRESERVING SOME OPEN SPACE AREAS- AND- STILL HAVING PLACES FOR PEOPLE WEEK WE CAN'T SIMPLY CRIMINALIZE. BEING HOMELESS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR JANET ALL BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE PLACES AND SO I'M HOPEFUL WHEN I READ THE TERMS OPEN SPACE. THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD TAKE ANY ALL WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES THAT MEAN DESIGNATED ZONED OPEN SPACE OR DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CALLS OPEN SPACE. CAN NOW BE RESTRICTED- IF I NEED NARAL. I NEED THOSE THINGS NARROWED DOWN TO BE MORE CLEAR. DO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOR. THEY ABOUT RIVER. AND ESTUARIES AND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CAMPING THAT WE GET AN IDEA RUN DOES AND ALL THAT ABSOLUTELY SENSITIVE HABITATS ABSOLUTELY. SENSITIVE CRITICAL PLACES IN A IN A IN A COMMUNITY YOU KNOW THE LAWN OF THE STATE CAPITOL- BUT- WHAT I WANT I AM I JUST IT FEELS A LITTLE TOO BROAD AT THIS POINT TIME SO I- BUT I DO WANT TO. TAKE TO CONTINUE THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO HAVE IN THE HOPES THAT YOU GUYS CAN NARROW THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE AND ALSO THE OTHER THING I WOULD. LIKE TO ASK THE OFFICERS TO CONSIDER IS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS TO IDENTIFY WHERE PEOPLE CAN CAMP- YOU KNOW WHERE CAN THEY SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE OF SOME COMMUNITIES WILL PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND SAY NO PLACE NO PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S ALL. WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY DOESN'T EVERY EVERY COMMUNITY HAS IN THERE SOMEPLACE THAT IF YOU NEED TO FALL ASLEEP YOU'RE NOT TEN UNPERMITTED PERSON FALLING ASLEEP- THERE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO YEAH. YEAH THE FEW OF THESE THE THESE ISSUES- SO THERE ARE. IN OF OUR- WHERE WE KNOW WE DON'T. YOU KNOW WHAT TO MAKE BEING- HOMELESS A CRIME A FELONY WE DON'T WANT TO- CRIMINALIZED POVERTY BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES THAT YOU CAN'T CAN'T FOR VARIETY REASONS I WOULD SAY NEW CURRENT DISTRICT MR WORD. ON THE BEACH YOU CAN'T HAVE A CAMPSITE THERE WITH A HUNDRED PEOPLE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BEACH IN THE HIGHEST THAT JUSTICE IT'S A PUBLIC PLACE FOR WRITER REASONS WE DON'T PERMIT THAT. AND I THINK WE'RE SAYING OTHER CERTAIN PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THERE PUBLIC PLACES BECAUSE OF. THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC APPRECIATES THAT PUBLIC ACCESS AND ALSO FOR AN AMOUNT OF REASON VERY MINOR REASONS THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE- UNPERMITTED. CAMPSITES I DO COULD CURRENT 1100% MISTER BENNETT THAT WE SHOULD OFFER PEOPLE. A ALTERNATIVE AND THAT GOES BACK TO THE BOISE. ISSUE AND IN HERE WE TALK ABOUT THAT IN THIS IN THE AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK TODAY. AND IN MY EYES. GOOD ON HERE TO THE PARKWAY WHICH IS LITERALLY TWO MILES FROM HERE AND COULD FIND. FIVE HUNDRED CAMPERS WITHIN TWO HOURS. WITH JUST WALKING DOWN HERE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO PEOPLE SAID OKAY HE CAN'T CAN'T HEAR. BUT YOU CAN GO OVER TO. THE PARK AND RIDE IT AT THAT THAT- ET. YOUR SPACE J. TWENTY FIVE. FOURTEEN GO TO OTHER CREEK AND POWER IN YOUR SPACES DEL TWELFTH. THOSE ARE YOUR TWO OPTIONS BUT YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. YOU'RE RIGHT WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE A SAFE PLACE TO GO. AND FRANKLY- THAT'LL GIVE MORE SAFETY FOR THEM. THE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE ACTUALLY THE HOMELESS THERE IF YOU READ THE STORIES ABOUT. ASSAULTS OF WOMEN DOWN THERE IT IS HORRENDOUS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS DOWN THERE. AND SO IT'S AS PUBLIC SAFETY FOR A LOT OF SURE WE HAVE. THE SAFETY MY STORIES AND THERE WAS A WOMAN RAPED AND MURDERED UP ON THE PARKWAY A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND THAT HE RIPPED FROM THE HEADLINES BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS WHO ARE- YOU KNOW. VICTIMS OF CRIME DOWN THERE- AS WELL SO- WE DO NEED TO OFFER PEOPLE PLACE TO GO. BUT THE RIVER THE OTHER SAD TRUTH OF THIS IS I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CLEANUPS INCLUDING A FEW WEEKS AGO AND TALKED TO SOMEONE ADVOCATE IS THERE. AND THEY SAY THAT SOME OF THE CAMPERS.
