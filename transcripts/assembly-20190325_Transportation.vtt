A SENSE?

00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:32.190
WELL I THINK THAT WHAT WE

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:34.459

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.667
VARIOUS IDEAS OF WHAT WOULD BE

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.402
THE BEST SOLUTION BUT THE ONE

00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:44.970
THAT.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:46.304
HAS UNANIMOUS WERE NEAR

00:26:46.371 --> 00:26:48.273
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IS THE

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.075
ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS SELECTED --

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:52.110
BY CALTRANS AND ULTIMATELY --

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.612
ENDORSED BY -- SELECTED BY METRO

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:58.149
AND CULTURE AND SO WE HAVE -- AN

00:26:58.216 --> 00:27:00.418
APPROACH THAT I THINK IT BRINGS.

00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:02.654
UNITY TO EVERYONE IN TERMS OF

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.756

ONLY TELL YOU WHAT THE IMPACT

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.159
HAS BEEN ON THE SURROUNDING AREA.

00:27:08.226 --> 00:27:10.895
FOR ALL THESE MANY YEARS AND

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:14.733
IT'S BEEN -- VERY MUCH -- AN

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.368
IMPACTED THIS DEVASTATED AREA

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:18.103
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:19.504
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE WE'RE

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:20.739
PURSUING I THINK ARE GOING TO

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:23.942
BREAK THE RIGHT KIND OF HARMONY.

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:25.977
AND MOVEMENT OF TRAFFIC AND

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.746
THERE CAN THE RIGHT WAY.

THANK YOU HI I APPRECIATE THAT

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:30.382
THAT'S ALWAYS A TUG.

00:27:30.448 --> 00:27:31.783
THE TUSSLING THAT'S GOING ON

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.718
WITH LOCALS IN THE STATE ON MANY

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.120
OF OUR PROJECTS BECAUSE A LOCAL

SEE IT ONE WAY AND THE STATE

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:39.991
SEASON ANOTHER SO THAT BRINGS UP

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:40.625
THE SECOND QUESTION WHICH WOULD

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:41.059
BE.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.360
HOW DO WE FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:43.661
WE HAVE AN EVER INCREASING

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.797
CAPACITY NEED FOR MANY OF THE

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.699
HIGHWAY SEVENTEEN BEING ONE OF

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.067
THOSE AND WE'RE NOW?

00:27:49.134 --> 00:27:50.435
GONNA HAVE A BOTTLE NECK.

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.871
ESSENTIALLY IN THAT THAT AREA

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.439
THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO HERE.

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.141
YEAH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:27:56.207 --> 00:27:58.076
PROJECTS STILL ON THE

00:27:58.143 --> 00:28:00.278
CONSTRUCTION CORD OF CALTRANS

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:02.814
MISSION TO INCREASE CAPACITY ON

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.483
THE SEVENTY AND THAT WILL CAUSE.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.018
A RESTRICTION THAT WILL BE

00:28:07.085 --> 00:28:09.888
IMPACTED BY NOW THIS RESTRICTING

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:13.425
AREA SO MY CONCERN IS JUST.

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:14.893
HAVE WE TALKED ENOUGH WITH

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:17.395
CALTRANS ABOUT THEIR FUTURES FOR

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.130
THE SEVEN TEN AS A WHOLE AND

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:20.498
WHAT IS THE LAND MANAGEMENT

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:22.267
PRACTICE OF THE LOCALS.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:23.668
AS YOU SAID SOME OF THIS IS

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:23.902
GOING.

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:25.303
TO BE UNITS ON THIS LAND WE

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.639
UTILIZE FOR GROWTH POTENTIAL YET

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.474
THE HIGHWAY WON'T BE ABLE TO

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.309
HANDLE THAT GROWS SO WHERE HOW

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:34.712
DO WE RESOLVE THAT CONFLICT AND

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:38.583

THOUGHT WHEN FOREIGNERS MOVED TO

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:22.907
CALIFORNIA THEY NEED TO

IF THIS MUTUAL SYSTEM BECOMES IN

00:37:31.048 --> 00:37:33.084

CALIFORNIA.

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.231
AND THE THOUGHT BIGGEST PARKED

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.367

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.968
IF THIS BILL IS APPROVED.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.515
OF THE DRIVING SECURITY.

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.018

WITH RESPECT TO THIS BILL IT IT

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.243

KIND.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.279

SIXTY FIVE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.795
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:33.464
THERE IS A CURVE CHANGE HOW DOES

THAT CHANGE FOR THOSE PEOPLE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.037
HAVE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.540
TYPE OF LICENSING. FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:43.574

AND THEY DRIVE ON THE RIGHT BUT

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:49.079
WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE FROM THE

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.648
U. K. AND MANY OF THESE OTHER

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:51.949
COUNTRIES.

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:52.616
THE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.185
THE DRIVE ON THE LEFT AND WE

00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:55.920
SEEN MANY PEOPLE COME TO THIS

00:40:55.986 --> 00:40:56.987
COUNTRY.

00:40:57.054 --> 00:41:00.224
ACTUALLY HAVE ACCIDENTS WERE

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:01.659
ACTUALLY I'VE BEEN ONE OF THOSE

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:04.428
ATTENDING EMTS VOTE BECAUSE

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:04.728
EIGHTY STE.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:07.464
LOST TRACK OF THEIR PRESENCE AND

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.733
THREE DRIVING ON THE LEFT AGAIN.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.669
CALLING AHEAD ON SO HOW DO WE

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.037
REMEDY THAT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.038
ADDRESSING IT.

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.272
WELL I THINK FIRST OF ALL

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:18.609
WHETHER YOUR FROM OUR COUNTRY OR

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:21.979
CALIFORNIA -- THAT WHETHER YOU.

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:23.681
HAVE PASSED OUR TESTS THAT STILL

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:24.582
DOESN'T.

00:41:24.648 --> 00:41:26.250
ELIMINATE ANY ACCIDENTS WE SEE

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.252
MANY MANY AMERICANS IN ACCIDENTS

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.354
EVERY DOWN BUT AS FAR AS FOREIGN

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:32.656
COUNTRIES IT'S JUST IT'S LOOKING

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.658
AT THE UNIFORMITY AMONG THE

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.360
STANDARDS WHICH IS WHY THIS WAS

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.494
BROUGHT.

00:41:37.561 --> 00:41:39.496
FOR FORWARD AS FAR AS MAKING

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:42.466
SURE THERE'S AT LEAST A OF

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:45.436
COMMON -- RULES TO THE ROAD IF

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:47.571
YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY --

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:49.406
THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY SHOWING

00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:52.576
THAT THEY HAVE PASSED BY.

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:54.712
GAINING THEIR LICENSE IN THE

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.513
COUNTRY THAT THEY'RE AT BUT I DO

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.415
AGREE WITH YOU THE RIGHT AND

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.417
LEFT ON BUT IT IS LIKE WHEN WE

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.152
GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:04.121
OURSELVES AND WE RENT A CAR

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.756
THERE'S THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME

00:42:05.823 --> 00:42:09.827
DIFFERENCES BUT AS THOSE

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:11.662
INDIVIDUALS GET INTO THE CAR

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:13.230
RENT THE CAR SIGN ALL THE

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.865
INSURANCE AGREEMENTS I THINK

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.101
THEY ARE NOTING THAT THEY'RE

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:18.602
GOING TO BE EXTREMELY.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.538
CAREFUL IN STARTING OUT.

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:24.108
JUST LIKE A YOUNG DRIVER WOULD --

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:27.044
WHETHER THERE'S SIXTEEN OR

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.646
EIGHTEEN SO DOES NOT ENSURE THAT

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:30.848
THEY WOULD NEVER BE AN ACCIDENT

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.283
BUT I THINK.

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:39.823
THERE'S SOME ON BASIC -- AS WE

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.425
SAY UNIFORMITY THAT WERE SEEN IN

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.393
ALL COUNTRIES WITH DRIVING PRIME

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.560
BUT AND I AGREE WITH THAT

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:44.061
COMPONENT THE BASICS.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.062
WHAT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IS

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.764
REALLY THE RULES OF THE ROAD

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.132
WHICH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:49.266
DIFFERENCES?

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.201
OF FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO THAT

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:53.437
THAT WAS MY REAL CONCERN WITH

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.139
RESPECT TO THAT AS IT IS TODAY

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:56.640
UNDER THE LAWS.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:57.608
WHETHER YOU'RE FROM OREGON

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.143
NEVADA ARIZONA.

00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:01.011
AFTER YOU ESTABLISH RESIDENCY

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:01.779
HERE IN.

00:43:01.845 --> 00:43:04.081
CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE TEN DAYS TO

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:07.051
GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND BUT

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.652
YOU HAVE A COMMONALITY OF YOUR

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:09.920

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.023
WHEN YOU GOT YOUR LICENSE OR SO
