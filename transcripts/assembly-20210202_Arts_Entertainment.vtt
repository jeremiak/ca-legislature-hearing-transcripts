LARGER LABOR MARKET SINCE THE

00:41:12.403 --> 00:41:13.537
DEPTHS OF THE DOWNTURN IN

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.073
APRIL. WE'VE ONLY RECOVERED 44%

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.142
OF OUR JOBS CALIFORNIA IN

00:41:18.209 --> 00:41:20.744
DECEMBER THERE WERE ONE POINT

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.513
FIVE MILLION FEWER PEOPLE

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.615
EMPLOYED IN THE STATE THEN IN

ROUGHLY 8% SINCE FEBRUARY THIS

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.992
BASIC GROWTH THIS RECOVERY

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:36.894
TRAILS IN THE NATION OVERALL

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:40.931
WHERE THE NUMBER OF JOBS IS.

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:41.832
ONLY SHRUNK BY SIX POINT 5% IT

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:45.436
IT. NINETEEN POSES SIGNIFICANT

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:48.472
LOSSES TO THE CREATIVE ECONOMY

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:49.506
AND FOR RURAL PARTS OF THE

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:53.510
STATE. ARTS CULTURE CREATIVITY

00:41:53.577 --> 00:41:54.678
THESE ARE SOME OF THE KEY

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:57.114
SECTORS THAT DRIVE OUR REGIONAL

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.883
ECONOMIES THERE SO VERY

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.351
IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:42:00.417 --> 00:42:02.253
ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN OUR RURAL

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.421
AREAS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:06.523
MANY OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTS

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.058
OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.661
NECESSITATE THE CONGREGATION OF

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:13.364
A LARGE GROUPS OF UNRELATED

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.399
PEOPLE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:18.135
SAME ALSO OFTEN IN VERY CLOSE

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.371
PROXIMITY GIVEN THE NATURE. OF

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.572
OUR REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:24.942
CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE TO USE

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.210
SPACE CREATIVELY. WHEN THE

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:27.845
VENUE IS A SMALL LOCAL ARE A

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:29.847
LARGE OUTDOOR CONCERT VENUE AND

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.582
ARTS MUSEUM THESE WERE THE

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:34.251
FIRST INDUSTRIES WE SAW TAKE A

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:36.854
HIT. AND WE EXPECT THEM TO BE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.123
THE LAST ONE TO MAKE A FULL

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.357
RECOVERY I THINK THAT'S

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:42.660
IMPORTANT THE FIRST OUT IN THE

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:45.529
LAST BACK- IN OUR REPORT WE

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:47.298
BREAK THESE DOWN ITO FIVE KIND

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.900
OF GLOBAL INDUSTRY SECTORS. AS

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.802
SEATING ON THE SCREEN- AT THE

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:52.770
END OF THE MONTH WILL BE

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:55.272
RELEASING- THE ELDEST REPORT

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:57.207
WHICH WILL CAPTURE ALL OF

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:58.442
TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE SPECIAL

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:00.277
CHAPTER. ON THE CALL WITH

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.379
NINETEEN M. PACT- IT'S GONNA BE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.514
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT REPORT

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.683
THIS YEAR BY IN THE FALL WHEN

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:08.252
WE WERE BEGAN OUR ANALYSIS- I.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:09.720
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:11.889
NUMBERS THESE WILL BE UPDATED

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:12.589
AS I MENTIONED IN THE END OF

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:15.392
THE MONTH- BUT FOR NOW I THINK

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.594
THEY GIVE A GOOD INDICATION. AS

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.295
THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:21.865
RECOVERY- GOING INTO NOVEMBER

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:24.601
DECEMBER- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:26.937
THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES- WE

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:29.039
CLING FILM ADVERTISING DIGITAL

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.975
DIGITAL VISUAL ARTS. AS WELL AS

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.810
THOSE OCCUPATIONS THAT MAY BE

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:34.611
HOUSED IN NON CREATIVE

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.580
INDUSTRIES- PERFORMERS

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.282
ARCHITECTS GRAPHIC DESIGNERS

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:40.017
THAT MAY WORK AT FIRMS THAT ARE

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:42.152
INTEGRATED INDUSTRY. THEY COME

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.587
FROM THE SAME WORKFORCE

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.356
DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE THE SAME

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:47.124
ECOSYSTEM OF NONPROFIT

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:48.692
PARTICIPANTS EDUCATIONAL

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:52.029
FACILITIES. IN ADDITION- TO THE

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:53.697
DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:54.765
ARTS AND CULTURAL SECTOR

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:56.433
SUPPORTS A LARGE NUMBER OF

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.402
OTHER PROFESSIONS BOTH UPSTREAM

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.237
AND DOWNSTREAM. AS YOU SEE

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.906
HERE- IN THE FALL IN AUGUST WE

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.808
ESTIMATED ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:07.711
AND EIGHTY THOUSAND- JOBS- LOST

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:10.381
MISSING TEMPORARILY FURLOUGHED-

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:12.516
IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A- HAS A

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.218
HUGE IMPACT FOR THOSE SUPPLIERS

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:16.687
UP CHANGE UP. THE FOOD CHAIN OF

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:19.423
THE- SUPPLY CHAIN AND FOR THOSE

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.591
PHONES THAT USE THAT WAGE

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.159
INCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:23.627
LOCAL ECONOMY. THERE'S SOME

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:26.130
INHERENT STRUCTURAL OCCUPATIONS

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.565
THAT MAKE- ARTS WORKERS

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:29.833
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.236
THESE UNDERLYING CHANGES. ONE

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.004
OF THE MAIN NOTES IS THAT.

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.906
FOLKS ARE THREE AND A HALF

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.174
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SELF

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.410
EMPLOYED IN THE ARTS WE HAVE TO

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.310
LEVERAGE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.379
DATA SOURCES AND THINKING WE

00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:43.814
BECAUSE OF THE CARE ACT THE

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:45.115
PANDEMIC OUT OF ONE OF THE

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.784
SYSTEMS PROGRAM. AND ALLOW

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:55.426
THOSE FOLKS TO CONTINUE TO-

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:55.926
EXHIBIT NORMAL HOUSEHOLD

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.227
SPENDING BEHAVIOR. AS I COME UP

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:58.862
ON MY TIME AND SAY NO WHERE HAS

00:44:58.929 --> 00:45:00.297
THE IMPACT BEEN TO WRITE AND

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.232
MORE IMMEDIATE. IN PERFORM ARTS

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.867
AND WE'VE SEEN A NAY WHY- THERE

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.570
IN TAX EXEMPT REVENUE- IN IN

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:09.373
THE THIRD QUARTER OF ROUGHLY

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:09.973
FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. THIS IS

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.243
DEVASTATING. AS WE LOOK FORWARD

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.011
TO WHAT RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IN

00:45:14.078 --> 00:45:15.846
THE STATE. IT IS OUR

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.848
RECOMMENDATION THAT ANY

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.850
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RECOVERY

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.718
ANY RESILIENCE NARRATIVE

00:45:21.785 --> 00:45:23.554
INCLUDE THE ARTS THERE ARE SUCH

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.889
A VALUABLE- IMPORTANT PLAYER

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:26.957
AND THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE

00:45:27.024 --> 00:45:28.792
DONE. A LOT OF OUR LOCAL

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:30.727
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK DOES NOT

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:33.030
ALLOW FOR THE REBOUND OF THE

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.932
ARTS IN THE WAYS THAT THE

00:45:34.998 --> 00:45:37.134
INDUSTRIES ARE CHANGING. WE

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:39.002
HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER HOW

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.138
WE CURATE OUR ECONOMIC

00:45:41.205 --> 00:45:43.273
REGULATORY SYSTEM LOCALLY AND

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.309
WITH A LENS ON EQUITY WITH THE

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:47.411
LENS ON THE WORLD AND- LANDS ON

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.046
RESILIENCE IT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:51.482
TIME- WE DON'T SEE AN ECONOMIC

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:53.617
RECOVERY- THAT WE WANT TO BE A

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.219

THE POLICE TO CALIFORNIANS-

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.660
THAT ARTS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT

CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS. BUT

01:21:40.762 --> 01:21:42.397

INVESTMENT I THINK THAT'S A

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:26.207
CRITICAL INVESTMENT THAT HAS

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.709
BEEN SORELY LACKING IN FACT IF

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.511
YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING FOR.

HAD PRETTY MUCH STALLED FOR

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.451
ABOUT. TWELVE YEARS- IF I IF

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:37.752
I'M REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:39.287
EITHER TWELVE OR ELEVEN YEARS

01:22:39.354 --> 01:22:43.625
FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND- ONTO A

01:22:43.692 --> 01:22:44.693
TWO THOUSAND ONE TILL ABOUT TWO

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:49.197
THOUSAND TWELVE- IN MY FIRST

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.398
TERM OF OFFICE I INTRODUCED A

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:52.767

DOLLAR PER CAPITA BASIS- THAT

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:04.879
ENDED UP BEING NEGOTIATED DOWN

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.981
INTO A I THINK A FIVE MILLION

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.250
INCREASE AND SLOWLY IT'S BEEN

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.186
INCREASING SINCE THEN. BUT WE

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.587
NEED TO MAKE THIS PUSH AGAIN

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.055
ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.324
CRISIS WHEN IT'S CRITICAL THAT

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:19.427
WE SEE TO WHAT EXTENT OUR STATE

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:20.895
IS DEPENDENT ON THE

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:23.198
ENTERTAINMENT ECONOMY- CREATIVE

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:26.134
ARTS ECONOMY I SHOULD SAY- AND

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.302
THE SECOND POINT SHE MADE

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.437

MISSING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN.

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.643
GOING AS WE'VE AS AS THIS

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.746

MAKE THINGS AS WE GO ALONG- AND

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:51.960

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:53.528

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:54.729

AFTER THAT THE PANDEMIC BEGAN I

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:06.405
BECAME DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:08.241
THIS QUESTION OF HOW WE NEED A

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.675
PERFORMING ARTS COMMUNITY WOULD

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.143
COME BACK FROM COVE IT. HOW

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:12.044
WOULD WE KEEP ARTISTS AND

01:59:12.111 --> 01:59:13.613
PATRONS SAFE HOW WOULD WE

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:15.414
CONVINCE THEM THAT WE COULD DO

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:17.483
SO HOW COULD WE MAKE EVERYONE

01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:18.851
FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE WERE

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:21.020
DOING SO. I DECIDED THAT

01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:22.221
TEMPLATE SHOULD REACH OUT TO

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:23.990
OUR THEATRICAL LABOR UNION

01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:25.958
PARTNERS TO FORMULATE A PLAN.

01:59:26.025 --> 01:59:27.493
THEY EACH HAD RETAIN NOTABLE

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:30.096
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND I THOUGHT.

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:30.930
IF I COULD CONVINCE

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:32.298
REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH LABOR

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:34.367
UNION TO JOIN ME IN A ROOM

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:35.601
TOGETHER WE COULD ASSEMBLE

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:37.169
COMPREHENSIVE GUIDELINES

01:59:37.236 --> 01:59:38.304
ADDRESSING THE SAFETY NEEDS AND

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:40.540
COCERNS OF ALL THE ARTISTS WHO

01:59:40.606 --> 01:59:42.108
COLLABORATE IN THE CREATION OF

01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:43.643
LIVE PERFORMANCE. AND WHOSE

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:44.710
WORK PUTS THEM ESPECIALLY AT

01:59:44.777 --> 01:59:46.112
RISK IT TOOK A LITTLE

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:48.047
PERSUASION BUT FINALLY OUR

01:59:48.114 --> 01:59:49.515
JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT CODE

01:59:49.582 --> 01:59:50.616
SAFETY TASK FORCE WAS

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.385
ASSEMBLED. AND AS FAR AS I KNOW

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.986
OUR TASK FORCE IS THE ONLY ONE

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:55.922
OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY FOR

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:56.822
OUR INDUSTRY WHERE

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:58.558
REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH UNION

01:59:58.624 --> 02:00:00.092
HAVE SAT DOWN WITH EACH OTHER.

02:00:00.159 --> 02:00:01.727
AND WITH PRODUCERS TO WORK ON A

02:00:01.794 --> 02:00:02.962
COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SAFETY

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:05.831
RECOMMENDATIONS. EVEN THOUGH IT

02:00:05.898 --> 02:00:07.567
WAS COMPANIES ARE SMALL I

02:00:07.633 --> 02:00:09.535
BELIEVE WE ARE UNIQUELY WELL

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:10.836
POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THE

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:12.972
KOBE CRISIS. I DON'T THINK MANY

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:13.739
AT THIS TIME WOULD FEEL

02:00:13.806 --> 02:00:15.141
COMFORTABLE ATTENDING A POP

02:00:15.207 --> 02:00:16.676
CONCERT OR A HUGE TOURING

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:18.778
PRODUCTIONS. BUT WHAT IF PEOPLE

02:00:18.844 --> 02:00:20.079
WERE ABLE TO GO TO A BOTANICAL

02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:23.149
GARDEN OR ZOO OR MISSED MUSEUM

02:00:23.215 --> 02:00:24.150
SCULPTURE GARDEN THAT WAS

02:00:24.216 --> 02:00:26.218
ALREADY. ALREADY PROVED TO BE

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:27.553
OPEN AND WHAT IF WHEN THEY GOT

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.688
THERE THERE WAS A STRING

02:00:28.754 --> 02:00:30.456
QUARTET PLAYING OR A SERIES OF

02:00:30.523 --> 02:00:32.391
DANCE SOLOIST PERFORMING OR

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:33.926
MAYBE A MAGICIAN DAZZLING

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:35.361
EVERYONE WITH SLEIGHT OF HAND.

02:00:35.428 --> 02:00:37.330
SMALL SMALL PERFORMANCES FOR

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:39.398
SMALL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WAS THE

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:41.200
WAY TO START I THOUGHT. THIS

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.401
WOULD BE A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.170
LEARN HOW TO GATHER SAFELY ALL

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:45.371
SPREAD OUT WEARING MASKS

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:47.406
OUTSIDE AND THIS WOULD BE A WAY

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:48.841
FOR PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS TO

02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:51.277
LEARN TOGETHER HOW TO PRODUCE

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:51.911
AND PERFORM SAFELY IN A

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:53.846
PANDEMIC. THE BIG PRODUCTION

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:55.047
HOUSES MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED

02:00:55.114 --> 02:00:56.882
RIGHT AWAY BUT THE VAST NETWORK
