00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.981
THE VARIOUS WAYS TO CONNECT LA

00:26:23.048 --> 00:26:26.484
WITH ON SUMMER TO DO NO

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:30.822
COUNTIES. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:31.389
MANY OPTIONS THAT ARE. SURE

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:32.023
TALK ABOUT THE GOAL MINE IN MY

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.726

THEY MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THE GOAL

00:26:40.398 --> 00:26:43.335
LINE IS BUT THEY KNOW THAT

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:43.868
THERE'S A GOLD MINE. SO

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:44.436
CERTAINLY THE GOAL LINE HAS

00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:47.439
ALWAYS BEEN IN THE PLAN FOR

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:48.073

THE AIRPORT BUT IN THE INLAND

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:44.102
EMPIRE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:44.602
INVEST IN PUBLIC RAIL

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:47.705
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THE CAN

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:48.373
TRANSPORT PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER

AIRPORT RAIL LINKS HAVE BEEN

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:59.884
SHOWN TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:00.451
THAN THOSE WITHOUT- AIRPORT

00:32:00.518 --> 00:32:04.122
RAIL LINKS CAN BE A CATALYST

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:04.756
FOR WIDER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:08.593

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:19.163
SO YOU BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.764
CITY OF REDLANDS SEVENTY FIVE

00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:23.468

ANOTHER MILLION PEOPLE. AND SO

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:48.626
I REALLY URGE- YOU- AS WE DEAL

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:52.530
WITH THIS ISSUE TO TAKE THAT

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:53.030
INTO TO HEART. THERE ARE

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:57.001
ANOTHER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION

00:33:57.068 --> 00:34:00.872
PEOPLE THAT LIVE OUTSIDE OF

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:01.539
THAT TWENTY FIVE MILES- SO FROM

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:05.376
PARIS DOWN TO THE MENIFEE

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:05.910
VALLEY AND TO MARIETTA AND

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:09.313
LOOKED AT AND- TEMECULA- OUR

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:09.981
FRIENDS IN THE HIGH DESERT OUR

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:13.418
FRIENDS IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:13.985
OUR FRIENDS IN THE MOUNTAIN

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:17.755
AREAS. SO RAIL AND TRANSIT

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:21.592
ACCESSIBILITY TO THE AIRPORT IS

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:22.126
ABSOLUTELY A KEY ECONOMIC

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:22.760
DRIVER FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:26.197
REGION. ARE BUSINESS MEMBERS-

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:30.201
WOULD- TELL YOU THAT THERE'S AN

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:30.802
URGENCY TO THIS THEIR ABILITY

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:34.605
TO CONNECT TO THE AIRPORT THEIR

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:35.239
ABILITY TO BRING- PEOPLE INTO

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:38.476
THE AIRPORT TO DO BUSINESS

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:42.513
ABSOLUTELY KEY. SO DELIVERY OF

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:43.114
WHATEVER OPTIONS WE HAVE THE

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:46.918
SOONER THE BETTER. AND ALSO I

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:47.552
THINK THAT PART OF THAT FROM

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:51.189
THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:51.722
MEMBERS AGAIN WHO ARE THE

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:54.992
LARGER EMPLOYERS OF THE REGION-

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:55.693
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.464
TOO MUCH BUREAUCRACY. RIGHT IT.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.031
TRANSIT AND TRANSPORTATION

00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:03.634
INVESTMENTS ARE EXPENSIVE AND

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:04.335
SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO THAT

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:07.705
WITH AN EXISTING- AGENCIES- I

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:11.709
THINK ARE BUSINESS MEMBERS

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.310
WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:16.380
BEST. TALK ABOUT THAT TWENTY

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:16.981
FIVE MILE CIRCLE- COUNSELING

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:20.551
WAPNER- TALKED ABOUT- AS SOME

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:24.188
OF THE ISSUES- THE PARISH

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:24.822
SCHOOL BOARD IS TWO MILES SOUTH

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:28.659
OF THE AIRPORT TWO MILES SOUTH

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:32.630
THAT HAS POTENTIAL CONNECTIVITY

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:33.164
TO RIVERSIDE AND EVERYBODY

00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:33.798
GOING THAT WAY WHAT IT IS THE

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:37.201
SOLUTION FOR THAT TWO MILES- I

00:35:37.268 --> 00:35:41.038
THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT- THE

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:45.176
GREAT- POTENTIAL OF THE- THE

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:49.347
ERRO- SYSTEM- GOING IN FROM-

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:49.947
SAMBAR DINO TO REDLANDS- AND

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:53.618
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:54.252

TO THE NORTH OF THE AIRPORT.

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:01.893
AND THEN FIGURING OUT AGAIN HOW

00:36:01.959 --> 00:36:02.560
WE CONNECT- THAT SYSTEM TO THE

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:06.297

00:36:23.548 --> 00:36:26.817
SHOULD ALSO SEEK TO AVOID

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:27.285
DUPLICATING EXISTING

85% OF OUR WRITERS ALSO OWN A

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:15.292
CAR. SO THEY ARE CHOOSING TO

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:15.826
TAKE METROLINK SERVICE AND

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:16.260
THEREFORE REDUCING

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:19.797
APPROXIMATELY NINE POINT THREE

00:38:19.864 --> 00:38:20.431
MILLION CAR TRIPS PER YEAR- AS

HERE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:32.243
GROW AND- ENHANCE METROLINK

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:36.147
SERVICE IS ONE THAT FOCUSES

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:36.681
FIRST AND PRIMARILY ON THE

00:38:36.747 --> 00:38:40.484
CUSTOMER. TO GET PEOPLE TO GET

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.185
ON THE SYSTEM WE KNOW IT HAS TO

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:41.786
BE SEAMLESS AND EASY AND WE

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:44.889
DON'T NEED TO MAKE THEM PLAY

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:45.489
DETECTIVE IN OUR TO FIGURE OUT

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:48.793
HOW TO USE IT. AND SO. WE HAVE-

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:52.863
INITIATED A FEW KEY. STRATEGIES

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.497
LIKE A WIFI PILOT TESTS. OVER

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:57.268
TEN YEARS. WIFI IMMUNITY WAS

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:57.935
THE MOST REQUESTED IMMUNITY ON

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:01.338
THE METROLINK SERVICE. AND IN

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:01.972
NOVEMBER WE INITIATED THE FIRST

00:39:02.039 --> 00:39:02.606

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.047
TO IDENTIFY WAYS FOR US TO

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:10.614
BRING AMENITIES LIKE THAT.

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:13.884
WITHOUT INCREASING THE COST TO

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:17.855
OUR MEMBER AGENCIES IMPORT. AN

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:18.489
INTEGRATED SYSTEM IS REALLY KEY

00:39:18.556 --> 00:39:22.193
AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:22.593

COMPLEMENTARY- USES AND

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:26.864
APPROACHES BETWEEN A METROLINK

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:30.634
GOAL LINE AND THE FIFTY ONE

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:34.438
OTHER TRANSIT OPERATORS THAT WE

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.039
ALLOW TRANSFERS TO THIRTY TWO

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:38.809

PAST INCREASING THE TECHNOLOGY-

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.193
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.764

EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY AND-

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:27.685
LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.252
RETROFIT SOME OF THOSE OLD

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:31.455
DIESEL LOCOMOTIVES ARE COMING

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:32.089
OUT OF SERVICE. WITH SOMETHING

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:32.623
LIKE BATTERY ELECTRIC OR

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.793
HYDROGEN TAXI REDEPLOY THEM AS

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:36.393
PART OF A ZERO EMISSIONS FLEET

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.064
AS WELL. WE TALKED ABOUT IT

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.134
TRACKING A RETAINING WRITERS A

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:44.768
COUPLE OF THINGS I'D JUST LIKE

INCREASE ON OUR SYSTEM. MORE

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:56.547
SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THAT THOUGH

00:41:56.614 --> 00:41:57.147
WE SAW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

00:41:57.214 --> 00:42:00.951
IN THE DOWNLOAD OF OUR MOBILE

00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:01.552

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:40.944
CONNECTING RESIDENTS TO THE

00:54:41.011 --> 00:54:44.080
AIRPORT. WHICHEVER ONE WE CAN

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:48.218

PLAN AND IT'S NOT FUNDED AND

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.364

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:06.089
UNDER WAY FOR. DECADES AND

TO- THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:18.668
SO I THINK ONE OF OUR

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.268
CHALLENGES AND OBVIOUSLY PART

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:22.438
OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE

THAT UTILIZE THE AIRPORT AND-

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:35.585
CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.152
AND DOLLARS SPENT AND SO I

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:39.622
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.156
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:43.626
POINTED OUT WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.193
OUT HOW TO. MAKE THAT LINK

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.830
COMPLETE BUT IT'S ALSO

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:48.498
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. MANY OF

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:51.868
THE PLANS THAT YOU TALKED

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:52.435
ABOUT- IN TERMS OF SORT OF

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:55.972
INTEGRATING THE ENTIRE- INLAND

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:56.639
EMPIRE. INTO THE AIRPORT MAKING

01:02:56.706 --> 01:03:00.409
CONNECTION REAL CONNECTIVITY IS

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:04.213
CRITICAL AS WELL SO I I'M YOU

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:04.847
KNOW I JOIN WITH. MY COLLEAGUES

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:08.651
TO SAY THAT. SO WE WILL BE A

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:09.218
PARTNER AND CONTINUING TO

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:12.922
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO- INSURE THAT

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:16.759
THE GREATER SAN BERNARDINO

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:17.326
RIVERSIDE COUNTY AREAS ARE

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:20.897
BEING ABLE TO LINK TO. A

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:21.531
RESOURCE THAT IS NOT JUST FOR

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.031
SAMBAR INYO COUNTY BUT

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:25.301
CERTAINLY AS OF A DRIVER OF

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:25.968
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.372
CREATOR OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:29.972
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AND AS

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:33.342
SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN PASADENA

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.010
AND LOS THE IDEA OF- DRIVING TO

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:37.613
LA ACTS AND BEING A PART OF

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.214
THAT- NETWORK OF PARKING AND

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.951
GETTING TO TERMINAL- I THINK WE

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:42.585
ALL RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:46.255
HAVE A CLEANER SAFER WAY TO

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:46.789
TRAVEL TO AN INTERNATIONAL

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:50.459
AIRPORT AND I THINK THAT. THIS

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:54.597
DYNAMIC NEEDS TO WE NEED TO TIE

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.367
UP THE LOOSE ENDS ON THAT. BUT

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:58.935
JUST BE ONE DOLLARS. PEOPLE

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:02.905
THROUGHOUT. VOTERS THROUGHOUT-

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:03.539
THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY THE

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:07.109
INLAND EMPIRE SUPPORTED. AND IT

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:11.113
IS OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.781
THE FAIR SHARE OF DOLLARS MAKE

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:12.281
THEIR WAY INTO IMPORTANT

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:15.318
PROJECTS- IN THE IN THE

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:15.818
COMMUNITY AND SO. THIS

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:19.522
CONVERSATION AND OTHERS THAT

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.189
WILL FOLLOW HELP US GET A ROAD

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:23.726
MAP OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:24.360
THAT WE'RE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:27.563
POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:28.130
IN THE LOBBY. OF FOR. THE

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:31.968
DOLLARS THAT SHOULD RIGHTFULLY

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:32.568
COME INTO THIS REGION- SO I

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:33.169
JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT I

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:36.439
THINK. ARRAY YOU'VE ALREADY

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.039
OUTLINED THE- OUR PROCESS AND

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:40.610
HOW. THE GOAL LINE IS TO BE

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:44.480
CONSIDERED IN THAT SO A YOUR

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.081
YOUR PLANNING PROCESS IS VERY

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:48.484
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK AT SOME

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:49.018
POINT SEEING- SOME CLEAR

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:53.055
DEFINITIVE. L. NARROWING IN ON

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:56.826
THAT SIX OR SEVEN. MILE GAP

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:57.460
BECAUSE I MEAN LOOK. AS I MADE

01:04:57.526 --> 01:05:01.030
CLEAR IN MY OPENING STATEMENTS

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:01.564
WE DO HAVE A FUNDING GAP

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:05.401
BETWEEN POMONA. AND MARK LAYER.

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.002
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:09.272
VERY HARD AND COLLABORATIVELY

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:09.872
TO SEE THAT WE CAN GET THAT-

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:13.676
THAT GAP. OF FUNDING OF FINISH

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:17.980
WE HAD A GAP. FROM A SEUSS- TO-

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:22.118
TO PROMOTE POMONA- AND WE WORK

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:22.785
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS HILL

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:26.122
SO I HAVE EVERY BIT OF

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:26.756
CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE

01:05:26.822 --> 01:05:30.293
TO GET THE RESOURCES. TO SEE

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:34.530
THE LINE- TO MONTCLAIR. THE

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.197
POINT IS WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:35.798
THAN HAVING TO UBER FROM MY

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.868
CLEAR TO THE AIRPORT. SO BUT

01:05:38.934 --> 01:05:42.938

IT CENTERS ON THE POTENTIAL OF.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:24.380
A LINE A DOUBLING OF THE LINE-

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.014
TO EXTEND FROM BURBANK AIRPORT

IN AN ANSWER THE- IF THAT WERE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:01.277
TO HAPPEN IN THAT LINE WERE TO

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:04.513
BE DOUBLED WHAT IS THE

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.147
ANTICIPATED. NUMBER PERCENTAGE

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:08.951

FREEWAY IN THE STATE IS THERE A

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.922

STATE SO THIS NARRATIVE REALLY

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:54.943
STARTS FOR MANY OF US WITH OUR-

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:58.113
STATUTORY GREENHOUSE GAS

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:58.747
REDUCTION GOALS WHICH AS MANY

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:02.251
IN THE ROOM NO- WILL REQUIRE

MORE BETTER AND FASTER CLIMATE

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:03.485
SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO REACH

01:12:03.552 --> 01:12:06.755
THOSE TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.526
FIFTY TARGETS. HAD AND THAT'S

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:11.126
BEEN MENTIONED TRANSFERRED. OF

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:11.694
COURSE THE LARGEST SHARE OF

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.327
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.997
STATE REPRESENTING OVER HALF OF

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:19.168
GHG EMISSIONS. NEXT IN ADDITION

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:19.802
UNFORTUNATELY VEHICLE MILES OF

01:12:19.868 --> 01:12:23.205
TRAVEL OR BE AND HE IS GOING IN

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:23.806
THE WRONG DIRECTION- UP PER

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:27.309
CAPITA RATHER THAN. DOWN AND

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:31.547
HAS BEEN FOR SOME YEARS. AND AS

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.081
MANY KNOW CALIFORNIA IS

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:32.681
PROJECTED TO ADD TEN MILLION

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:35.818
NEW RESIDENTS- PRESUMABLY WHO

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:39.755
WILL NEED TO LIVE PLACES AND

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:40.289
WORKPLACES AND GO LOTS OF

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:40.889
PLACES AND- HOPEFULLY NOT ADD

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:44.326
TOO MUCH TO THAT. THE M. T.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:44.893
INCREASE THAT WE SAW ON THE

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:48.430
LAST SLIDE. THE FUTURE

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:48.897
CALIFORNIA WILL BE OUT

01:12:48.964 --> 01:12:52.501
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIVERSE IN

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:53.135
TERMS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY AS

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:56.672
WELL AS OLDER SO AT THESE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.306
GRAPHS REPRESENTS- AGE BRACKETS

01:12:57.372 --> 01:13:00.709
FROM YOUNGEST ON THE BOTTOM TWO

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:01.310
OLDEST ON THE TOP AND YOU CAN

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:01.944
SEE. THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW THAT

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:05.147
THE TOP PART IS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:05.748
WIDENING SO WE'LL HAVE A VERY

01:13:05.814 --> 01:13:09.284
DIFFERENT POPULATION- SORT OF

01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:13.355
STRATA GUIDE- AND AS IS NO

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:13.956
SECRET HOUSING PRODUCTION IN

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:14.590
THE STATE IS NOT KEEPING PACE

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:17.659
WITH DEMAND SO THE RED ARROW

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:18.293
THERE IS THE ANNUAL PROJECTED

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.730
PRODUCTION PRODUCTION AND

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:22.331
DEMAND. I NEEDED AND THE BAR

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:26.034
GRAPHS REPRESENT THE ACTUAL

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:26.668
HOUSING PERMITTED ON THE GROUND

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:30.272
AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES ARE THE

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:30.939
MOST SCARCE HOUSING TYPE SO ON

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:34.309
THE LEFT YOU SEE. THE DEMAND

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:38.213
FOR VERY LOW AN EXTREMELY LOW-

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:38.847
AREA MEDIAN INCOME HOUSING FOR

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:42.785
RENTAL RENTER HOME OWNERS AS

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:43.385
GUINEA RENTER HOUSEHOLDS. AND

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:46.755
ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:47.356
SUPPLIED THE NUMBER OF HOMES

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:47.923
THAT ARE AVAILABLE AT THOSE

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:51.026
INCOME STRATA WITH. THE RED

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:51.593
SHAPE REPRESENTING A PRETTY

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.997
SIGNIFICANT GAP THE

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:55.531
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HAS

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:59.268
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS BY

01:13:59.334 --> 01:13:59.868
RACE AND ETHNICITY SO HERE WE

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:03.272
SEE HOUSING COSTS BURDEN-

01:14:03.338 --> 01:14:03.839
DISAGGREGATED BY RACE. SOME

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:07.543
STARK CONTRAST AND- MOST-

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:08.043
GROWTH IN THE STATE IS

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.713
PROJECTED IN THE MOST

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.381
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO WE

01:14:12.447 --> 01:14:15.818
SEE THE MAP REPRESENTS IN

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:16.351
YELLOW- THE TOP. 25% OF

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:16.952
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:20.222
THE STATE AND THE GRAY SHADED

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:20.823
AREAS REPRESENTING PROJECTED

01:14:20.889 --> 01:14:24.293
HOUSEHOLD GROWTH. THERE IS A

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:28.397
SPATIAL MISMATCH BETWEEN JOBS

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:29.064
AND HOUSING SO ON THE LEFT MAP

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:29.565
YOU SEE THAT JOBS ARE

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.768
CONCENTRATED ON THE COAST AND

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:33.302
ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THAT

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:36.638
PROJECTED HOUSING GROWTH IS

01:14:36.705 --> 01:14:37.239
LARGELY CONCENTRATED INLAND.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:41.109
ONE OF THE- THE RESULTS OF THIS

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:41.643
PHENOMENON IS THAT SUPER

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.380
COMMUTERS ARE ON THE RISE THESE

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:46.048
ARE FOLKS WHO TRAVEL MORE THAN

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:49.351
NINETY MINUTES EACH WAY TO GET

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.018
TO A JOB. AND THIS SNAPSHOT IS

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:53.455
FROM THE BAY AREA BUT I KNOW

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.056
WELL THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:54.623
ALIVE AND WELL IN SOUTHERN

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.659
CALIFORNIA AS WELL- THE LATEST

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.260
NUMBER I SAW FROM THE CITY OF

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:01.763
PALMDALE IS AT FORTY FIVE

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:02.364
THOUSAND PEOPLE TRAVEL EVERY

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:02.965
SINGLE DAY IN THEIR CARS. TO

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:06.168
THE LA BASIN AND THEN BACK

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:06.668
AGAIN IN THE EVENING. I

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:10.172
TRANSPORTATION OF COURSE

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:10.772
INCREASES THE HOUSEHOLD COST

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:14.243
BURDEN- PARTICULARLY IN LOWER

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:14.843
DENSITY COMMUNITIES SO THAT

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:18.614
CHART SHOWS. THE PERCENTAGE. OF

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.047
TOTAL HOUSING PLUS

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:22.718
TRANSPORTATION COSTS TO AREA

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:23.285
MEDIAN INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. I

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.989
APOLOGIZE THAT SOME OF MY

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:27.589
FORMATTING GOT A LITTLE BIT.

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:31.126
THE VISTA MISINTERPRETED HERE

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:35.230
BUT- BUT THE THAT TAKE AWAY IS

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:35.864
THAT SOME OF THE- LESS DENSE

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:39.167
COMMUNITIES TOWARD THE BOTTOM

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:39.835
OF THE ON THAT CHART HAVE SOME

HOUSING. AND TRANSPORTATION

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:47.910
COST LOOKED AT ANOTHER WAY-

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:51.580
THIS IS A TOOL THAT MEASURES

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:52.214
AFFORDABILITY IN TWO DIFFERENT

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:52.848
WAYS SO ON THE LEFT WE SEE A

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:56.151

TRANSPORTATION COSTS- FOR A

01:16:13.335 --> 01:16:16.972
COMBINED TOTAL OF 45% OF AREA

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:17.539
MEDIAN INCOME THE AREAS OF

01:16:17.606 --> 01:16:17.973
AFFORDABILITY SHRINK

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.143
CONSIDERABLY. SO WE NEED TO

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:21.543

MOBILITY SECTOR AND IT'S OVER

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:44.693
50% WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE- ALL

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:45.193
THE OIL PRODUCTION AND

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:48.963
DISTRIBUTION. EMISSIONS SO IT'S

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:52.967
A IT'S A HUGE HUGE CHALLENGE.

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:53.435
AND IT'S GETTING WORSE

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.069
UNFORTUNATELY WORK WE'RE DOING

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:57.238
BETTER IN ALMOST EVERY OTHER

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:57.906
SECTOR EXCEPT SECTOR AND THAT'S

01:22:57.972 --> 01:23:01.343
THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC I KNOW

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:01.876
US LOCALLY AND MANY OTHER

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:02.510
GROUPS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:05.914
AND- IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE FOR

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.517
ALL OF US. ONE OF THE FACTORS

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:10.085
HERE WHICH I THINK IS JUST

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:13.722
COMING TO THE FOREFRONT MORE

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:14.222
RECENTLY CALIFORNIA AIR

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:14.756
RESOURCES BOARD RECENTLY

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.026
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BUT- THE VAST

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:18.626
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS AND

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:19.194
PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD ARE

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:22.397
BUYING LARGER AND LESS FUEL

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:23.031
EFFICIENT VEHICLES EVEN ASKED

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:26.668
HAS LINE ALL THESE ELECTRIC

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:27.135
VEHICLES ARE BECOMING

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.472
AVAILABLE- THESE LARGER ON

01:23:30.538 --> 01:23:31.039
TRUCKS AND CARS. ARE SINGLE

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:34.843
HANDEDLY TORPEDOING OUR ABILITY

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:35.410
TO MEET OUR CHRONICLES. AND

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.813
THEY'RE ALSO OTHER CONCERNS IS

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.414
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.048
PUBLIC SAFETY ABOUT STV'S WHICH

01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:40.648
I'LL TALK TO ABOUT A LITTLE

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:43.351
LATER- THEY ARE MORE DANGEROUS

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:43.952
FOR EVERYONE OUTSIDE OF A CAR

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:47.489
IF A CHILD OR AN OLDER ADULT IS

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:48.056
STRUCK BY A HIGHER PROFILE

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:48.690
VEHICLE. YOU WILL NOT ROLL OVER

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:51.726
THE HOOD OF THAT VEHICLE ON AND

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:55.497
THE OUTCOMES ARE ARE. FAR FAR

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:56.131
GRIMMER FOR FOLKS INVOLVED IN.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:59.667
A COLLISION TO THOSE VEHICLES.

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:00.301
ANOTHER SLIGHT JUST KIND OF

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:03.905
ILLUSTRATES HOW EXPONENTIALLY

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:04.506
DIFFERENT IT IS DEPENDING ON

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:05.106
HOW WE'RE MOVING AROUND OUR

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:08.042
COUNTY SO IF YOU'RE MOVING

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:08.643
AROUND IN A LARGE FOUR WHEEL

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.177
DRIVE SUV ON YOUR OWN.

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:12.514
URINATING YOU KNOW. FAR FAR

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.148
MORE THAN IF YOU'RE ON A BUS OR

01:24:13.214 --> 01:24:16.618
IF YOU'RE WALKING. SO HOW DO WE

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:20.622
REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS.

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:21.256
REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:21.856
THERE'S LOTS OF EMPHASIS ON

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:25.026
THIS- REPLACING CAR TRIPS AS

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:25.660
WELL AS PLACING HOUSING CLOSER

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:29.097
TO JOBS IN TRANSIT LOT OF

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:29.764
PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:30.365
A WALK TO WORK OR A SHORT BUS

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:33.435
RIDE TO WORK BUT IT WITHOUT

01:24:33.501 --> 01:24:34.035
HOUSING CLOSE TO JOBS THAT'S

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:37.372
JUST NOT FEASIBLE. ELECTRIFYING

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:37.939
TRANSPORTATION WE'RE SEEING

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:38.573
THIS IS REALLY AN AMAZING TREND

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.743
THE LAST FIVE YEARS- ALL MANNER

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:45.814
OF BICYCLES YOU KNOW AND LARGER

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.414
VEHICLES ARE ARE NOW AVAILABLE

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.884
IN ELECTRIC AND THEN IT

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:54.322
IMPROVING. ALSO HAVE TO BE MORE

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:58.026
EFFICIENT VEHICLES FEDERAL

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:58.660
GOVERNMENT IS NOT HELPING US ON

01:24:58.726 --> 01:24:59.327
THIS AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA

01:24:59.394 --> 01:25:02.363
IS A LEADER IN THE WORLD AND WE

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.964
ARE THANKFUL THAT YOU ALL ARE

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:06.634
PUSHING BACK. SO I WANTED TO

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:07.235
TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THERE SOME

01:25:07.302 --> 01:25:11.005
AMAZING THINGS HAPPENING IN OUR

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:11.639
PART OF THE COUNTY ARE PART OF

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:14.943
THE WORLD. FOOTHILL TRANSIT

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:15.610
NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FIRST IN

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:19.013
THE NATION WILL BE ALL ELECTRIC

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:19.547
BY TWENTY THIRTY. THEY'RE

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.048
SETTING THE STANDARD FOR

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:23.318
EVERYONE ELSE. AS SAN GABRIEL

HAVE SECURED A NUMBER OF GRANTS

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.223
TO. ADVANCE TO STAND WILL

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:31.793
ABILITY INCLUDING THE FIRST

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.393
REGIONAL ELECTRIC BIKE SHARE

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.763
PROGRAM IN THE STATE FIFTEEN

01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:36.364
CITIES HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:36.965
IN PARTICIPATING IN THIS. I'M

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:39.934
REALLY INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY

01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:40.502
ELECTRIC BIKES IF YOU NEVER

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:41.035
TRIED ONE EASIER THAN A

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:44.138
SKATEBOARD TO USE FOR OLDER

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:48.142
ADULTS- YEAH. EASIER THAN

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:48.743
SCOOTERS MUCH MORE FORGIVING

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:49.344
AND THE HILL YOU KNOW THEY

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.747
TACKLE HILLS GREAT AND IF IT'S

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:53.381
A HOT DAY IT'S ALSO OFTEN USED.

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:56.885
I LOVE USING THEM I TAKE MY SON

01:25:56.951 --> 01:25:57.552
TO SCHOOL COUPLE DAYS A WEEK ON

01:25:57.619 --> 01:26:00.755
ELECTRIC BIKE SO. LET US KNOW

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.356
IF YOU WANT TO TRY ONE THESE

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:01.990
ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ONCE AND

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:04.826
YOUNGER MILLENNIALS- ARE

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:05.460
INCREASINGLY USING SCOOTERS AND

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:09.163
OTHER- ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO GET

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:09.797
AROUND WE SHOULD EMBRACE THAT

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:10.365
WE DON'T ALL NEED TO USE THE

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:13.101
SAME THING TO GET AROUND.

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:13.735
HOWEVER STILL THE GREEN AND THE

01:26:13.801 --> 01:26:17.472
BEST FOR OUR HEALTH AND ALL

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:18.072
SORTS OF OUTCOMES IS. WALKING

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:18.640
AND BIKING AND JUST GETTING

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:21.609
AROUND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:22.243
LOTS OF MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:25.680
IS THE HEALTH BENEFITS

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:26.281
ENVIRONMENTAL DOWN BENEFITS.

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:26.848
THANKS LINE. SOMERS TALK A

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:29.918
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT OUR

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:30.552
ORGANIZATION REALLY FOCUSES ON

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:34.022
IS- COMPLETE STREETS MORE

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:34.656
SUSTAINABLE STREETS AND GREENER

01:26:34.722 --> 01:26:35.223
STREETS. ON THE CONCEPT IS

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:38.159
JARGON BUT IT BASICALLY MEANS

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:38.693
WE'VE DONE ONE THING FOR

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.227
SEVENTY YEARS AND THAT'S

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:42.363
DESIGNED STREETS PRIMARILY JUST

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.997
TO MOVE ONE TYPE OF USER. WE

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:43.631
REALLY NEED TO BE WORKING MORE

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.801
HOLISTICALLY AND LOOKING AT ALL

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.435
DIFFERENT TYPES OF USER GROUPS

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:50.638
INCLUDING. PEOPLE ON FOOT NOW

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:51.239
TRANSPORTATION DELIVERING AND

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:54.909
ON IN PUBLIC TRANSIT. SO TALK

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:55.510
ABOUT CROSS DESIGNER OF THE

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:56.144
STUFF DOES NOT TO COME A TON OF

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:59.447
MONEY AND MANY OF YOU I KNOW

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:00.048
TRAVEL ALL OVER THE STATE AND

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:03.284
PROBABLY HAVE NOTICED SOME OF

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:03.885
THESE THINGS EVERY COMMUNITY.

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:04.419
FOR THE MOST PART APPROACH

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:07.388
THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. GOOD

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:07.989
THE NEXT SLIDE I'VE US NICE

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:08.556
EXAMPLES HERE SO THIS IS

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:11.459
STANDARD CROSSWALK YOU SEE THIS

01:27:11.526 --> 01:27:12.060
IN MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA-

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:12.694
AND TO GO TO THE NEXT SIDE THIS

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.064
IS. AN EXAMPLE SIMPLE-

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:19.934
CONTINENTAL CROSSWALK WITH THE

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:20.535
CURVE EXTENSION MAKING THAT

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:21.169
CROSSING DISTANCE A LITTLE BIT

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:24.205
SHORTER. EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:24.839
GET ACROSS YOU CAN GET THE NEXT

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:28.276
TIME YOU CAN GET- ARTISTIC WITH

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:28.943
THESE TO THE PLAYHOUSE DISTRICT

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:29.544
ASSOCIATION IN AND PASADENA

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:32.847
HAS. HAS AN AMAZING ARTISTIC

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:33.481
CROSSWALK PROGRAM THEY'VE HIRED

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:36.851
LOCAL ARTISTS TO DESIGN THESE

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:37.452
TEMPLATES AND THEY USE THEM

01:27:37.518 --> 01:27:40.822
THROUGHOUT THEIR DISTRICT TO

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:41.356
REALLY GIVE IT. A CERTAIN

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:45.193
UNIQUE FEEL AND IT ALSO ADDS TO

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:45.760
SAFETY. LAST COUPLE YEARS.

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:49.330
PEDESTRIAN START. SOME PEOPLE

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:49.964
CAUGHT EARLY WALKED TIMING THE

01:27:50.031 --> 01:27:50.632
PLANNERS CALL IT A AND L. P. I.

01:27:50.698 --> 01:27:53.534
A LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:54.202
ESSENTIALLY GIVES- PEDESTRIAN A

01:27:54.268 --> 01:27:57.572
COUPLE SECONDS HEAD START

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:58.239
GETTING ACROSS THE INTERSECTION

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:58.806
BEFORE THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:01.809
SO. REDUCING US RIGHT TURNING

01:28:01.876 --> 01:28:02.510
CONFLICTS THIS CALL VERY LITTLE

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:06.080
MONEY BUT- HAS TREMENDOUS

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:09.884
BENEFITS FOR SAFETY. AND

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:10.518
MICHAEL MOBILITY LANE SO FOR A

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:11.119
LONG TIME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:14.355
BIKE LANES BUT- AND SO MANY

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:14.989
MORE PEOPLE USE THESE THAN JUST

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:18.359
PEOPLE ON BIKES. SO PEOPLE ON

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:18.926
SCOOTERS AND SKATEBOARDS AND

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:19.460
ALL THESE HE WHEELS AND

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:22.530
DIFFERENT THINGS YOU SEE MORE

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:23.131
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT ARE

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:23.698
COMING DOWN HERE. THE LOCAL

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:26.734
EXAMPLE AND CLAREMONT THE LOWER

01:28:26.801 --> 01:28:27.368
PICTURE FOOTHILL BOULEVARD IT

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:27.935
JUST REDESIGNED THE STREET

01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:31.039
SPACE A BIT INCLUDED STORM

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:31.572
WATER CAPTURE MORE STREET

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:35.009
TREES- SO MULTI BENEFIT

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:35.576
REDESIGN OF THE STREET SO

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:39.147
MOVING VEHICLES HELPING

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:39.747
EVERYONE GET AROUND SICK MORE

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:43.384
SAFELY. THREE TREES- TREMENDOUS

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:44.018
BENEFITS FOR A WALK ABILITY FOR

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:47.522
PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:48.189
ENVIRONMENT- AND- YOU KNOW THIS

01:28:48.256 --> 01:28:48.723
IS ONE OF THE LOWEST COST

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:51.926
THINGS YOU CAN DO AND IT'S

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.593
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:55.897
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON. AND

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:56.531
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE FROM THE

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:57.098
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.234
TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS A LOT

01:29:00.301 --> 01:29:00.835
OF OUR STREETS LOOK LIKE THIS

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:04.172
NOT A LOT OF AMENITIES. NEXT

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:04.806
SLIDE. WILL SHOW A REDESIGNED

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:08.409
WITH STREET TREES WITH AN

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:08.976
ELEVATED CROSSWALK WITH THE

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:09.577
SAFETY ALLEN IN THE MIDDLE SO

YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN ACROSS

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.281
THE WHOLE STREET ONCE BECAUSE

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:16.684
NOT EVERYONE STOPS FOR US WHEN

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:17.318
WE- MUST WALK. I AND THEN SOME

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:17.919
OF THE OTHER BENEFITS AND WE

01:29:17.985 --> 01:29:20.955
TALKED ABOUT PHYSICAL NOW. ONE

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:21.622
IS MENTAL HEALTH AGING IN PLACE

01:29:21.689 --> 01:29:25.126
OUR SENIORS SO THEY CAN GET

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:25.760
AROUND WITHOUT A CAR NOT ALWAYS

01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:26.360
YOU CAN BE ABLE TO DRIVE FOR

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.230
EVER- ON. PERSONAL FINANCE.

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:29.864
SICK AND IT'S ABOUT SIX GRAND A

01:29:29.931 --> 01:29:33.267
YEAR TO HAVE A CAR WHEN YOU ADD

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:33.835
UP INSURANCE TICKETS PARKING

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:37.638
EVERYTHING ELSE. AIR QUALITY

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:38.139
BENEFITS QUALITY OF LIFE

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:38.673
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MORE

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:41.976
WALKABLE VIBRANT DOWNTOWN TO DO

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:42.610
BETTER ECONOMICALLY. JOBS WHEN

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:46.114
YOU INVEST IN THESE TYPES OF

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:46.681
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE MUCH

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:50.184
MORE. LABOR INTENSIVE SO FIXING

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:50.818
SIDEWALKS IMPROVING SUCH LOCAL

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:54.522
STREETS CREATES MORE JOBS THAN

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:55.089
FOR EXAMPLE PUTTING ANOTHER

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:58.426
LANE ON THE FREEWAY- PUBLIC

01:29:58.493 --> 01:29:58.993
SAFETY AND THIS. THAT'S WHAT

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.530
I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ON NOW.

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:02.997
IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:03.498
SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS BUT

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:06.801
TRAFFIC VIOLENCE REMAINS A HUGE

01:30:06.868 --> 01:30:07.468
PROBLEM WE ARE AT A TWENTY FIVE

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:08.136
YEAR HIGH RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:11.072
FATALITIES. OF PEOPLE ARE.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:15.042
RIDING BICYCLES AND WALKING IN

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.676
THE STATE. A ONE OF THE FACTORS

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:19.247
HERE IS THOSE LARGER VEHICLES

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:19.914
WE HAVE MORE HAVE YOUR VEHICLES

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:20.515
ON THE STREETS WHEN THEY HIT

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:23.284
PEOPLE THEY DO A LOT OF DAMAGE.

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:23.851
AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS OF

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:27.755
COURSE EVERYONE HAS A

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:28.356
SMARTPHONE NOW. AND IF YOU'RE

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:28.990
OPERATING HEAVY VIA AND PAYING

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:32.126
IT. THAT CAN BE DEBT TO. SO

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:32.760
THESE ARE JUST ACCEPT I KNOW WE

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:35.963
HAVE A LIST THE LAST TWO YEARS

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:36.597
OF PEOPLE PREDOMINANTLY PEOPLE

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:40.101
WALKING KILLED AND IT

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:40.735
OVERWHELMINGLY IMPACT. CHILDREN

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:44.338
IN OLDER ADULTS. WHO OFTEN

01:30:44.405 --> 01:30:44.872
DEPEND ON WALKING TO GET

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:48.376
AROUND- CRASHING ON ACCIDENT-

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:49.010
MANY OF THESE COLLISIONS FATAL

01:30:49.076 --> 01:30:52.780
COLLISIONS THAT WE CAN'T WE

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:53.314
HAVE TO STOP CALLING THEM

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:53.915
ACCIDENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE.

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:57.118
OFTEN PREVENTABLE WITH BETTER

01:30:57.185 --> 01:31:00.988
DESIGN WITH BETTER EDUCATION.

01:31:01.055 --> 01:31:01.656
HI IF YOU CAN ADVANCE TO SLIDE.

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:02.156
ABOUT 18% OF TRIPS IN

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:05.426
CALIFORNIA BY FOOTER BIKE 40%

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:09.197
OF FATALITIES ARE PEOPLE DOING

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:09.797
EITHER OF THOSE THINGS AND WE

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:10.431
WERE TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.467
TO GET AROUND BY PUTTING MY WE

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:14.068
WORK WITH A LOT OF YOUTH. AND

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:17.672
IT'S PARTICULARLY NOW MONEY

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:18.306
CENTER SAYING YOUR BILL VALLEY

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:21.676
A LOT OF THESE. YOUTH ARE ARE

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:22.310
FROM. THIS COMMUNITIES AND THEY

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:25.980
ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY-

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:26.547
VULNERABLE TO BEING KILLED

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:27.081
WHILE WALKING AROUND THEIR

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:30.518
CITIES. AND ONE OF THE REASONS

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:31.118
THIS IS AGAIN HISTORIC UNDER

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:34.455
INVESTMENT SO LOW INCOME

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:35.122
COMMUNITIES. ONLY ABOUT HALF OF

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:38.492
THEM HAVE SIDEWALKS HAVE

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.093
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIDEWALKS

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:39.694
VERSES AND ALMOST 90% OF HIGH

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.897
INCOME COMMUNITIES. SO THE LAST

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:43.531
I KNOW EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:47.201
BUDGET AND IF YOU BROUGHT YOUR

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:50.972
CHECKBOOK- I'M NO DIFFERENT. I

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:51.572
WILL HIGHLIGHT THAT LESS THAN

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:52.006
1% OF ALL THE STATE

01:31:52.073 --> 01:31:55.343
TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IS

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:55.877
INVESTING IN WALKING AND

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:59.513
BICYCLING PROJECTS AND OTHER

01:31:59.580 --> 01:31:59.981
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

01:32:00.047 --> 01:32:00.581
IMPROVEMENTS- MEANWHILE ABOUT

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:03.618
18% OF THE TRIPS ARE BY FOR A

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.252
BIKE. AND CALTRANS AS A GOAL

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:07.889
BUT I BELIEVE TWENTY THIRTY

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:08.522
FIVE TO DOUBLE THAT SO WE WANT

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:11.692
TO GET TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT-

01:32:11.759 --> 01:32:12.360
TRIPS BY PUT HER BIKE IN ORDER

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:15.897
TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND

01:32:15.963 --> 01:32:16.497
MANY OF OUR OTHER GOALS. AND

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:20.301
TALK A QUICK ABOUT ONE PROGRAM

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:20.935
SO THAT THE BIGGEST PROGRAM TO

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:21.569
FUND THESE THINGS IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:24.572
AT THE STATE LEVEL TO THE

01:32:24.639 --> 01:32:24.972
CALIFORNIA ACTIVE

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:25.606
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. YOU'VE

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:28.476
HAD FOUR CYCLES OF THIS SO FAR

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.110
AND- NOW IT'S EVERY TWO YEARS.

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:41.122
EIGHTEEN YOU CAN SEE WAS

01:32:41.188 --> 01:32:45.192
EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE- NOT MANY

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:45.793
CITIES RECEIVE THIS FUNDING-

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.427
AND CYCLE FIVE IT HAS INCREASED

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:49.897
MUCH- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:32:49.964 --> 01:32:50.498
WE'RE SEEING OUR ORGANIZATION

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:51.132

THAT. AFTER APPLYING ONCE OR

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:57.939
TWICE CITIES JUST STOP. BECAUSE

01:32:58.005 --> 01:32:58.572
THEY REALIZE IT'S TOO HARD AND

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:02.209
IT TAKES. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:33:02.276 --> 01:33:02.843
OF HOURS TO SUBMIT THESE THINGS

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:03.277

GOING TO KEEP DOING IT SO I

01:33:11.485 --> 01:33:14.622
THINK. THE REQUESTED FUNDING

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:15.222
WOULD BE EVEN HIGHER IF. IF

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:18.659

OURSELVES IN A NICHE THAT

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:08.022
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WHERE

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:08.622
WERE TACKLE THINGS THAT ARE

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:12.159
DONE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN A

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:12.760
SINGLE JURISDICTION AND THESE

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:13.394
OTHER REGIONAL ISSUES THAT YOU

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.530
ARE CALLING US TO SPEAK TO

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:17.164
TODAY. ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:37:17.231 --> 01:37:17.765
WE DO ARTS GUY WILL PROBABLY

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:20.768
THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:21.402
WOULD PRODUCE IS THE REGIONAL

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:24.538
TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT'S

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:25.139
REQUIRED BUT BOTH FEDERAL AND

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:25.773
STATE LAW HOW WE DO THIS EVERY

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:28.742
FOUR YEARS AND WE'RE IN THE

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:29.343
MIDDLE OF OUR CURRENT UPDATE

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:33.013
WHICH IS A TWENTY TWENTY UPDATE.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:37.051
HOW WE CALL THE CAN OKAY

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:37.651
BECAUSE INTO IS TO RE. GET A

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:38.319
THE FIVE THAT WE HAVE A REGION.

01:37:38.385 --> 01:37:41.422
THAT IS LIKE I SAID THE MOST

01:37:41.488 --> 01:37:42.056
THAT CAN VIABLE REGION BECAUSE

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:45.693
OF JUST LA- BUT BECAUSE OF ALL

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.327
OF THE REGION COMING TOGETHER

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:49.830
AND GETTING NEEDED TOGETHER.

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:50.364
AND SO THAT ELEMENT OF

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:53.734
CONNECTIVITY IS IMPORTANT AND

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:54.335
THAT WAS THE END OF THE NATURE

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:54.969
OF THE CONVERSATION YOU HEARD.

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:58.005
ON THE FIRST PANEL WE ACTUALLY

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:58.505
DID A CONNECTIVITY STUDY

01:37:58.572 --> 01:37:59.106
BETWEEN LA AND SOMEBODY YOU

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:02.142
KNOW THAT WAS ALLUDED TO.

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.810
EARLIER ON. IN THIS LONG RANGE

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:06.680
PLAN WHAT IT IS REALLY MORE OF

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:07.314
A VISION FOR THE REGION. IT'S

01:38:07.381 --> 01:38:10.618
NOT A MANDATE HOWEVER IT DOES

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:14.722
PROVIDE. OF VERY DATA DRIVEN-

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:15.356
FACT BASED- BASIS FOR WHERE WE

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:19.093
THINK WE SHOULD GO AS A REGION.

01:38:19.159 --> 01:38:19.660
ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH STATE

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:23.097
GOALS- STATE SUSTAINABILITY

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:27.134
AND- AND LIVABILITY GOALS WE

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:27.735
HAVE TO ASSURE THAT THE THINGS

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:28.269
THAT ARE IN THE PLAN OF

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:28.769
FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:31.438
OTHERWISE WE JUST DON'T MAKE

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:32.072
THINGS UP- SO THE POLICIES AND

01:38:32.139 --> 01:38:35.509
STRATEGIES IN THE PLANT. AND

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:36.110
THE PROJECTS IN THE PLAN HAVE

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:39.847
TO- HAVE A REASONABLY A SHORT

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:40.481
FUNDING OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:43.851
FIVE YEARS OF THE PLAN LIFE.

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:44.518
OUR STATE REQUIREMENT ON THE SP

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:48.055
THREE SEVEN FIVE OFFICE ALSO

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:48.622
REQUIRES US THAT THESE PLANS

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:52.259
SHOW AND DEMONSTRATE. HOW WE

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:52.893
ACHIEVE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.764
GAS ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:57.398
OUR TARGET IN THIS REGION IS

01:38:57.464 --> 01:39:00.768
19% REDUCTION. BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:01.368
FIVE FROM THE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:01.935
FIVE LEVELS- ON THE FEDERAL

01:39:02.002 --> 01:39:04.972
LEVEL OUR PLAN HAS TO BE IN

01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:05.572
CONFORMITY WITH HER CLEAN AIR

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:08.842
ACT. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:09.343
ARE WE ALSO STRIVE TO

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:13.314
ACCOMPLISH NEXT LINE. WE HAVE

01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:13.914
SOME CHALLENGE AND YOU ARE NEW

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:17.418
TO JOHN IN THIS I THINK SOME OF

01:39:17.484 --> 01:39:17.918
THOSE HAVE BEEN ALREADY

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:18.519
ARTICULATED SO I'M NOT GONNA.

01:39:18.585 --> 01:39:21.455
DO A MUCH ON IT- VERY

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:22.022
SIGNIFICANT IN OUR REGION

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:22.656
OBVIOUSLY IS THE FACT THAT WE

01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:25.759
KNOW WE'RE GROWING WE'RE GOING

01:39:25.826 --> 01:39:26.360
TO GROW BY ABOUT FOUR MILLION

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:29.830
THE PLAN. AND THE PLAN PERIOD-

01:39:29.897 --> 01:39:30.431
WE ARE GOING TO. AS A RESULT

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:34.001
HAVE- INCREASING DEMAND ON OUR

01:39:34.068 --> 01:39:34.601
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE HAVE

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:35.102
A DECLINE IN TRYING TO

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:38.405
RIDERSHIP. I'D SAY IN TIME WE

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:38.939
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:42.376
TRANSIT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR

01:39:42.443 --> 01:39:42.876
MOBILITY IN THIS REGION.

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:43.510
ESPECIALLY ON THE ON THE LONG

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:46.780
HALLS AND SO WE HAVE TO

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.381
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TRANSIT

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:50.751
WE HAVE TO ARREST THE DECLINE

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.352
IN TRANSIT RIDERSHIP IN THAT.

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:54.922
REST WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:55.589
ACKNOWLEDGE FACT WE THE SYSTEM

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:56.223
WE HAVE- THAT WE ARE PLANNING

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:59.093
FOR THE FUTURE OUR FUTURE

01:39:59.159 --> 01:39:59.727
SYSTEM MOST OF IT IS ALREADY

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:00.361
HERE IN TERMS OF HIGHWAYS FOR

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:03.330
EXAMPLE. WHEN A BILL NINETY

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:03.964
MORE BUT WHAT WE HAVE WE ALSO

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:04.565
HAVE TO BE VERY EFFICIENT AND

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:07.668
HOW WE USE THEM. AND THAT

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:11.472
REQUIRES SOME FUNDING. BUT MORE

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:11.972
IMPORTANTLY IS HOW WE

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:12.506
COORDINATE. LAND USE AND

01:40:12.573 --> 01:40:15.743
TRANSPORTATION WHY WE DON'T

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:16.377
HAVE LAND USE AUTHORITY AT THE

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:16.977
REGIONAL. LEVEL AT THIS GAG

01:40:17.044 --> 01:40:20.180
LEVEL WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:40:20.247 --> 01:40:20.814
A LAND USE AUTHORITIES TO MAKE

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:24.017
SURE THAT. WE'RE MAKE IN- OUR

01:40:24.084 --> 01:40:28.055
WORDS COLOCATION EFFICIENCY-

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:28.622
LOCATION- SHOPPER LAND USE

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:29.189
DECISIONS WHERE WE'RE WE'RE

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:32.659
MAKING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

01:40:32.726 --> 01:40:33.293

ITS ADOPTION- IT'S NOT. IT'S

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:29.710
NOT NEWS THAT WE'RE WORSE

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:33.347
INVEST IN TRANSIT- IT'S NOT

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:33.881
NEWS THAT GOODS MOVEMENTS

ESSENTIAL TO OUR ECONOMY IT'S

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:37.451
ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY SO

DEMAND AND SYSTEM PRESERVATION

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:49.863
AND THE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:50.464
HAVING IS ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN

01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:58.338
YOU LOOK AT THE KEY. CORRECTION.

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:02.743
ARE WE- ON WHAT TECHNO WILL DO.

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:03.377
IN TERMS OF TRIP READ THE ONE

WEEK. TO FAR WE- AWAY FROM HOME.

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:27.401
HOW AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SO.

01:43:27.467 --> 01:43:28.068
HOUSING DID. I THINK ALSO IN WE

OF OUR REGION AND THAT'S NOT A

01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:59.172
CHANGE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

01:57:59.238 --> 01:57:59.806
LEAVE AND- THEN. ONE AND MAYBE-

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:03.743
ARE THREE OR FOUR UNITS ON A

01:58:03.810 --> 01:58:04.343
CAR OR EVEN. ON ON FIVE ACRE

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:07.914
RANCH IS STILL BE TO DO THE-

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:11.717
HOWEVER AS WE INVEST. IN

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:16.155
INFRASTRUCTURE. LIKE AND WHICH

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:20.092
IS AN ALLEN OF OUR PLAN WE

01:58:20.159 --> 01:58:20.793
THINK. THE WAY BE IT WILL BE ON

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:24.297
WHY I MEAN IF. TO TAKE

01:58:24.363 --> 01:58:24.897
ADVANTAGE. OF THIS IS THIS

01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:28.501
REALLY LINE ALL AND BUILD

01:58:28.568 --> 01:58:29.068
AROUND THEIR BANK ARE CREE

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:32.572
DIVIDE. THAT MANY OF US TRAVEL

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:33.139
ALL OVER THE TO GO YOU KNOW

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:33.673
PLACES CREE THAT VIBRANCE

01:58:33.739 --> 01:58:36.709
AROUND WE CAN DO THAT REAL

01:58:36.776 --> 01:58:37.243
SMARTLY AND STILL OFFER.

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.743
AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:41.180
HOUSING VERY CLOSE TO WHERE

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:41.714
PEOPLE TRANSPORT AND THAT

01:58:41.781 --> 01:58:45.351
ALLOWS THEM TO REALLY BEGIN TO

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:45.852
CUT DOWN ON THE COMMUTE

01:58:45.918 --> 01:58:49.355
DISTANCES. FARTHER OUT THERE

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:50.056
BECAUSE IF WE IF WE HAVE TO ADD

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:53.426
A MORE JOBS AND MORE- MORE

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:53.993
PEOPLE WE NEED TO THEN BUILD

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:54.660
EVEN MORE CLOSER TO THOSE JOBS

01:58:54.727 --> 01:58:58.030
AND PEOPLE. WE ARE TODAY LOSING

01:58:58.097 --> 01:59:02.134
TALENT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:02.668
PORTABLE HOUSING OUR YOUNG

01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:06.105
FOLKS WE HAVE I THINK WE CAN

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:06.706
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE. FOUR YEAR

01:59:06.772 --> 01:59:10.009
UNIVERSITIES IN OUR REGION.

01:59:10.076 --> 01:59:10.610
THEY GRAB WITH THOUSANDS OF

01:59:10.676 --> 01:59:11.143
PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG

01:59:11.210 --> 01:59:14.614
TALENT EVERY MAY JUNE. MOST OF

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.214
THEM LEAVE THE REGION. THAT'S

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:18.751
NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR US AND I

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:19.385
THINK IT'S REALLY AND- ISSUE

01:59:19.452 --> 01:59:22.855
FOR US WE DON'T ABOUT. WE

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:23.422
CREATE MORE HOUSING AND TO

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:26.792
CREATE MORE HOUSING WE HAVE TO.

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:30.863
BE A LITTLE MORE INTENSIFIED.

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:35.034
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE AND I

01:59:35.101 --> 01:59:35.568
THINK IT'S ALSO A- FOR US

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:36.168
BECAUSE WE'RE- TO HAVE THIS

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:39.639
THESE PAY. CONVERSE IN LIFE US

01:59:39.705 --> 01:59:43.543
BUT ALL. OF THOSE WHO ARE IN A

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:44.143
TWO AND WHO LIE STREAMING TO

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:47.580
GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT ALL

01:59:47.647 --> 01:59:48.114
OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THESE

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:48.681
PROBLEMS REPRESENT. SOME OF

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:52.018
THEM WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET OUR

01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:52.652
ARMS AROUND FROM A LEGISLATIVE.

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:55.988
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THIS IT

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:56.622
UNDER HIGHLIGHTED A COUPLE OF

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:57.156

CONSIDERATION- HAVE BEEN UNDER

02:00:00.359 --> 02:00:00.927
CONSIDERATION. BUT ALSO THROUGH

02:00:00.993 --> 02:00:01.460

HANDS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY.

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:12.939
BUILD BUT THERE IS A ROAD AND

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:16.876
WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO- FIGURE

02:00:16.943 --> 02:00:17.510
OUT HOW BEST TO BRIDGE THE GAP

02:00:17.577 --> 02:00:18.077
IN TERMS OF COMMUNITIES THAT

NEXT. SEVERAL DECADES AND WHAT

02:04:56.555 --> 02:04:57.122
WE'RE SEEING IS THAT ITS FOCUS

02:04:57.189 --> 02:05:00.426
A LOT ON RAIL WHICH IS

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:00.993
WONDERFUL AND WE NEED MORE

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:01.560
CONNECTIVITY IN THE IN THE

02:05:01.627 --> 02:05:04.964

ACTUALLY RIDE THE BUS. I AND

02:05:05.631 --> 02:05:08.934
YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT INVESTING

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:29.755
IT BEFORE. YOU'RE NOT BEING

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:30.389
ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE NEAR BUS

02:05:30.456 --> 02:05:33.926
BUS LINES ARE OR- YOU KNOW

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:34.560
THOSE TRANSIT RICH COMMUNITIES

02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:35.127
BUT IT'S ALSO THE LACK OF A

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:38.464
VERY HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABLE

02:05:38.530 --> 02:05:42.167
AND DEPENDABLE SYSTEM THAT WILL

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:42.735
REALLY GET PEOPLE TO THEIR

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:46.405
DESTINATION ON TIME AND YOU

02:05:46.472 --> 02:05:47.006
KNOW WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:47.573
GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO A

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.609
SHELTER SO THAT. YOU KNOW FOR

02:05:50.676 --> 02:05:51.176
PEOPLE THAT ARE OUR THAT OUR

02:05:51.243 --> 02:05:51.810
HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS CAN ACTUALLY

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:55.014
USE OUR BUS SYSTEM SO IT'S

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:58.851
REALLY CRITICAL THAT WE ARE

02:05:58.918 --> 02:05:59.418
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THEM.

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:03.255
REVIVING OUR BUS AND IMPROVING

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:11.664
OUR BUSES. SO YOU KNOW WE KNOW

02:06:11.730 --> 02:06:12.264
THAT IN MANY IN THE MEASURE

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:15.868
REGION OF USERS OF OUR TRANSIT.

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:19.738
THEY ARE MATURE PEOPLE OVER SIX

02:06:19.805 --> 02:06:20.339
FOR. AND THE LOW INCOME SEVEN

02:06:20.406 --> 02:06:24.043
OVERSEE FOR OF. US MET RIDERS

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:28.280
LAW BURNED LESS THAN TWO

02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:28.881
THOUSAND A YEAR WITH THE MEAT

02:06:28.948 --> 02:06:32.318
INCOME FOR BUST OF. A LITTLE

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:32.952
OVER THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND FOR

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:33.519
RAIL RYE IT'S ABOUT THIRTY

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:36.622
THOUSAND A SO A VERY LOW INCOME

02:06:36.689 --> 02:06:37.189
POPULATION VERY OF OWNER POP

02:06:37.256 --> 02:06:40.592
AND IT'S ALSO A VERY. UP A

02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:41.193
POPULATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:44.897
ACCESS TO TWO VEHICLES- WE HAVE

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:49.001
SEEN THAT ABOUT 10% OF. BLACK

02:06:49.068 --> 02:06:49.635
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE ALLEY COUNTY

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:53.138
AREA DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:53.806
CAR IN ABOUT ELEVEN PERCENT. OF

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:57.276
LATINO. HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT HAVE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:57.843
ACCESS TO A CAR SO THESE ARE

02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:58.477
TRANSIT DEPENDENT ON. RESIDENTS

02:06:58.544 --> 02:07:01.580
THAT REALLY NEED ACCESS TO A

02:07:01.647 --> 02:07:02.147
GOOD QUALITY TRANSIT SYSTEM.

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:05.951
AND I MENTIONED THAT OVER 70%

02:07:06.018 --> 02:07:09.922
OF US WRITERS. ARE AT 70% A

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:10.556
MEASURE USERS ARE USING THE BUS

02:07:10.622 --> 02:07:14.059
SYSTEM BUT WE ARE LOSING. THE

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:18.130
OF BASS MAJORITY OF BUS RIDERS

02:07:18.197 --> 02:07:18.764
AND THIS IS THE LARGEST DECLINE

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:19.398
NATIONALLY IT'S- A PERCENT THAT

02:07:19.465 --> 02:07:22.534
METRO HAS LOST OVER THE LAST

02:07:22.601 --> 02:07:26.839
DECADE. I'M ONE OF THE- POINTS

02:07:26.905 --> 02:07:27.473
AN INMATE ABOUT KNOW IT'S BEEN

02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:30.476
MEN BEFORE FROM OTHER PANELISTS

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:34.680
THAT WE HAVE VERY- BIG GOALS

02:07:34.747 --> 02:07:35.280
FOR MEETING CARBON REDUCTION

02:07:35.347 --> 02:07:38.884
CARBON EMISSION REDUCTIONS- AND

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:39.518
YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE ARE DOING

02:07:39.585 --> 02:07:40.085
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REACH

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:43.155
THOSE GOALS BUT- UNLESS WE ARE.

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:43.722
TAKING THE BUS RIDERSHIP LOS

02:07:43.789 --> 02:07:47.393
VERY SERIOUSLY WE CANNOT

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:48.027
ACTUALLY MEET SOME OF OUR GOAL

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:51.630
SO. IN THIS SLIDE IT SHOWS

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:52.297
THAT- THIS GAG REGION MAKES UP

02:07:52.364 --> 02:07:55.968
OVER 50% OF TRANSIT- TRIPS THE

02:07:56.035 --> 02:08:00.072
SHARE OF TRANSIT TO TRIP SO WE

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:00.706
NEED TO REALLY RECOVER. THE 25%

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:04.209
IF NOT MORE OF TRYING A BUS

02:08:04.276 --> 02:08:04.843
RIDERS TO ACTUALLY. OF ATTEMPT

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:08.514
TO MEET SOME OF OUR CLIMATE

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:12.618
GOALS- AND OF CARBON EMISSION

02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:16.488
REDUCTIONS. SO I THE AS A COLD

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:20.793
A OR- IS REAL YOU KNOW FACED

02:08:20.859 --> 02:08:21.393
WITH- THE PRESS ORGANIZATIONS

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:25.330
AND- TRANSIT RIDERS WHO USE THE

02:08:25.397 --> 02:08:25.798
SYSTEM EVERY DAY WE'VE

02:08:25.864 --> 02:08:28.967
IDENTIFIED SOME SOLUTIONS- AND

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:29.601
METRO IS ACTUALLY A LEADER IN

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:33.105
REALLY IDENTIFYING SOLUTIONS

02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:33.739
AND- IMPLEMENTING THEM SO. WE

02:08:33.806 --> 02:08:37.309
HAVE A YOU KNOW A LEADER IN THE

02:08:37.376 --> 02:08:37.943
REGION BUT WE DO WANT TO SEE

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:38.610
THE AGENCY DO MORE TO ADDRESS

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:41.914
THE ISSUE OF FALLING RIDERSHIP

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:42.481
AND REALLY AND IMPROVE OUR

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:46.051
SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE- IN TWENTY

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:46.652
EIGHTEEN METRO PASS THE FIRST

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:50.089
OF ITS KIND. TRANSIT ORIENTED

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:50.656
TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITIES

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:54.259
POLICY- WHICH RELATES TO THE

02:08:54.326 --> 02:08:54.927
PANEL THAT SPOKE PREVIOUSLY BUT

02:08:54.993 --> 02:08:58.097
IT REALLY IS- LOOKING AT

02:08:58.163 --> 02:08:58.530
ADDRESSING COMMUNITY

02:08:58.597 --> 02:08:59.164
DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:08:59.231 --> 02:09:02.301
AND DISPLACEMENT ALONG THE

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:02.935
TRANSIT CORRIDORS- AND THIS IS

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:03.569
KEY TO REALLY BE ABLE TO. TO

02:09:03.635 --> 02:09:07.039
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ARE ABLE

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:07.606
TO KEEP RESIDENTS THAT ARE

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:10.809
DEPENDENT ON TRANSIT TO STAY IN

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:11.243
THOSE TRANSIT RICH

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:15.013
NEIGHBORHOODS- YOU KNOW THIS IS

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:15.614

HAVE. FUNDING ALLOCATED FOR

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:19.651
THIS POLICY SO IT'S REALLY

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:23.222
IMPORTANT THAT IT HAS TEETH AND

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:23.856
THAT MORE FUNDING IS ON CREATED

IMPROVING THE BUS SYSTEM WE-

02:09:57.356 --> 02:09:57.923
ARE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT. IN

02:09:57.990 --> 02:10:01.193

AREAS THAT WE HAVE SHELTER

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:09.401
THERE'S BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE

02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:13.472
NEAR- BUS STOPS AND AREAS WHERE

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:14.006
PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THE BUS

02:10:14.072 --> 02:10:17.376

MANY DECADES AND ENSURING THAT

02:11:07.826 --> 02:11:08.427
AREAS THAT YOU KNOW DON'T HAVE

ACCESS TO CAR ACTUALLY HAVE

02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:12.030

BUDGETING SO THAT COMMUNITY

02:11:37.322 --> 02:11:40.892
MEMBERS ARE REALLY INVOLVED

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:41.560
TRANSIT RIDERS ARE INVOLVED IN

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:42.127
HOW THESE FUNDING HOW THESE

02:11:42.194 --> 02:11:45.097
FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED TO REALLY

VERSES YOU KNOW PUTTING DOWN.

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:54.306
THERE DOLLARS INTO AREAS THAT

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:54.906
ARE NOT REALLY IMPROVING THE

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:57.676
TRANSIT SYSTEM ARE ENHANCING

SYSTEMS THEY THEY INITIATED

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:14.126
SURVEYS AND ARE STUDYING HOW

02:12:14.192 --> 02:12:14.793
THEY CAN YOU KNOW RE RE COOPER

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:18.530
GET BACK THERE TRANSIT THE BUS

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:19.131
WRITERS THAT THEY'VE LOST- AND

YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF A NETWORK

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:23.068
OF BUSES WILL WORK FOR OUR

02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:26.638
REGION- SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:12:26.705 --> 02:12:27.205
THAT. THERE IS- GOOD PLANS

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:30.842
GOING FORWARD METRO RECENTLY-

ADOPTED WHAT THEY'RE CALLING A

02:12:31.543 --> 02:12:35.280
TRANSIT FIRST MODEL- WHICH WILL

02:12:35.347 --> 02:12:39.117
HELP- RECOVER- SOME OF THE

02:12:39.184 --> 02:12:39.818
TRANSIT RIDERS AT THE HAVE BEEN

02:12:39.885 --> 02:12:40.452
LOST BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE

02:12:40.519 --> 02:12:41.019
FUNDING ALLOCATED THERE WAS

02:12:41.086 --> 02:12:43.755
ANOTHER MODEL CALLED THE FUTURE

02:12:43.822 --> 02:12:44.356
FUNDING MODEL THAT THE- WE'RE

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:47.859
CONSIDERING BUT DECIDED NOT TO

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:48.527
MOVE FORWARD WITH SO WE WANT TO

JUST MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW

02:12:49.227 --> 02:12:51.963
THERE IS A LOT MORE FUNDING

02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:55.834
ALLOCATED TO THE BUS- REDESIGN

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:56.401
A BUS RESTRUCTURING TO MAKE

02:12:56.468 --> 02:13:00.072
SURE THAT WE ARE. TAKING THIS

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:00.672
VERY SERIOUSLY OF RECOVERING

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:04.142
LOST ON BUS WRITERS AND

02:13:04.209 --> 02:13:04.776
INSURING THAT WE ARE CREATING

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:05.410
THE BEST AND MOST EFFICIENT BUS

02:13:05.477 --> 02:13:08.680
SYSTEM- FOR THE REGION AND

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:09.147
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:12.751
CONVERSATION ABOUT CONGESTION

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:13.385

ABOUT- HOW TO USE THOSE FUNDS

02:13:21.393 --> 02:13:21.860
TO REALLY- AND CONGESTION

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:25.263
PRICING JUST TO REALLY ANA

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:25.864
SHORT WAY IS THAT IT WOULD

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:33.505
CREATE- KIND OF LIKE- IT WOULD

02:13:33.572 --> 02:13:37.809
PRICE. ROLE THAT ARE IN THE

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:38.343

ENSURING THAT WE CAN. GET

02:13:55.594 --> 02:13:58.497
EXEMPTION FOR LOW INCOME

02:13:58.563 --> 02:13:59.131
DRIVERS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS WILL

STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES FOR THE

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:00.118
NUMBER ONE YEARS. SO ON I THINK

02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:16.268
GUESS THAT IS IT ON. I REALLY

02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:16.935
THINK THE IF WOULD ABOUT CA CAL

02:16:17.002 --> 02:16:17.502
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT

02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:20.372
CONNECTING STUDENTS TO

02:16:20.438 --> 02:16:20.939

THINK WE HAVE HE KNOWS THE MOST

02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:25.143
AWESOME ROAD SYSTEM IN THE

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:28.547
WORLD BUT IT'S TIME TO START

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:29.114
ADDING OTHER ELEMENTS LIKE

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:29.748
TRANSIT AND BIKING AND WALKING

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:33.084
AND BIKE SELECTED BIKES AND

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:33.652
SCOOTERS IN YES. SKATEBOARDS

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:41.092
FOR REBEL AND- I THINK THAT BUT.

02:16:41.159 --> 02:16:45.363
IT'S THAT SUDDENLY ALL OF THE-

02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:53.572
PEOPLE. WE NEED. FIVE THE

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:58.043
PRESENTATION. SO AND LIGHTEN

02:16:58.109 --> 02:17:02.247
MARIANI'S. SUDDENLY THERE

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:02.881
ALWAYS INTEREST IN TRADE PASS

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:06.418
AND I'VE WHEN I WAS THE THINK

02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:07.018
ABOUT THIS POINT I STARTED ON

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:10.422
LAW A WEEK AGO LOAN BUT I FOR

02:17:10.488 --> 02:17:11.089
ALL THESE TO AND JUST THE LAST

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:11.690
WEEKS WHERE CITIES OF THE ARE

02:17:11.756 --> 02:17:14.926
TALK ABOUT MAKING TRANSIT FREE

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:18.830
WHICH WHILE. AND I CAN IT WORK

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:19.431
I DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK IT'S

02:17:19.497 --> 02:17:23.101
BECAUSE- CITIES EVERYWHERE

02:17:23.168 --> 02:17:23.702
FACING THE SAME PROBLEMS WHICH

02:17:23.768 --> 02:17:27.105
ARE IN AS TRAFFIC AND IT'S

02:17:27.172 --> 02:17:27.672
POVERTY AND ITS- DECLINING

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:31.276
RIDERSHIP AND IT'S GREENHOUSE

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:31.810
GAS EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:35.480
CHANGE. SO ON WE ARE- WHY

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:39.584
STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES. YOU

02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:40.151
KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:44.089
COLLEGE IS HARD AND THAT IT

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:44.756
SEEMS TO BE OR CALL IT CAN BE

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:47.993
HARD AND IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:48.593
HARDER IN WE REALLY NEED AN

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:49.060
EDUCATED WORKFORCE IN

02:17:49.127 --> 02:17:52.230
CALIFORNIA TO REMAIN

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:52.797
ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE BUT

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:56.401
IT'S INTERESTING STUDENTS ARE

02:17:56.468 --> 02:18:00.472
POOR AND A STUDY BY ACCOUNT BY

02:18:00.538 --> 02:18:01.072
CSU IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOUND

02:18:01.139 --> 02:18:04.676
THAT AN ESTIMATED 10% OF CSU

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:05.210
STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS AND

02:18:05.277 --> 02:18:09.180
ALMOST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OUR

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:12.884
FOOD IN SECURE. AND YEAR THERE

02:18:12.951 --> 02:18:13.518
WAS A STUDY OF FORTY THOUSAND

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:14.085
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:18:14.152 --> 02:18:17.255
STUDENTS THAT FOUND THAT HAVE

02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:17.789
STRUGGLED TO BUY FOOD. A

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:21.359
MAJORITY HAVE A- OF THE

02:18:21.426 --> 02:18:21.960
STUDENTS HAVE TROUBLE PAYING

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:25.497
THE RENT AND 20% ARE HOMELESS

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:29.901
AND. WHEN STUDENTS IN THE FACE

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:30.502
OF SCHOOLS LIKE THESE YOU'RE

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:33.805
NOT GOING TO DO VERY WELL AT

02:18:33.872 --> 02:18:34.406
SCHOOL AND- IT WAS INTERESTING

02:18:34.472 --> 02:18:38.076
LAST WEEK AT METRO THERE WAS A

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:38.677
LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT. EVERY

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:39.310
STUDENT TRANSIT PASSES FOR LA

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:42.447
U. S. T. COLLEGE STUDENTS. LA

02:18:42.514 --> 02:18:46.584
U. S. D. IS STUDENTS KIDS WOULD

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:50.588
TUNES IN LOS ANGELES AND- IT

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:51.156
WAS SHOT TO ME. FIND OUT THE

02:18:51.222 --> 02:18:54.893
80% ALL YOU DIS LIVE IN POVERTY.

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:58.730
AND I JUST OBVIOUSLY PAYING FOR

02:18:58.797 --> 02:18:59.330
TRANSPORTATION THEN BECOMES A

02:18:59.397 --> 02:18:59.964
VERY BIG DEAL FOR THE STUDENTS

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:03.101
AND THEIR FAMILIES AND A LOT OF

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:03.768
THE STUDENTS. THEN EVADE PAYING

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:07.472
FARE IS AND THEY GET CAUGHT BY

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:08.073
THE POLICE AND THEN THEY GET

02:19:08.139 --> 02:19:11.376
TRAPPED UP IN THE- IN THE YOU

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:11.976
KNOW. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:15.613
THAT'S A BIT HARSH BUT THEY GET

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:16.247
YOU KNOW IT LEADS THEM IN THE

02:19:16.314 --> 02:19:19.784
WRONG DIRECTION. SO AND THERE'S

02:19:19.851 --> 02:19:20.385
ALSO A VERY FAMOUS STUDY THAT

02:19:20.452 --> 02:19:21.019
WAS DONE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BY

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:24.089
HARBOR THAT TALKS THAT FOUND

02:19:24.155 --> 02:19:24.689
THAT ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION

02:19:24.756 --> 02:19:28.159
IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST FACTOR.

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:28.760
IN THE ODDS OF THIS GAPING

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:32.130
POVERTY AND AVOIDING

02:19:32.197 --> 02:19:32.697
HOMELESSNESS SO CLEARLY ON.

02:19:32.764 --> 02:19:36.367
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:19:36.434 --> 02:19:36.868
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GIVE

02:19:36.935 --> 02:19:37.302
STUDENTS ACCESS. TO

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:40.672
TRANSPORTATION. END NEXT BUT SO

02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:44.642
IT'S NOT JUST STUDENTS THE

02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:45.276
BENEFIT IT'S ALSO THE SCHOOLS

02:19:45.343 --> 02:19:45.910
AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

02:19:45.977 --> 02:19:49.147
BECAUSE- THIS REDUCES DRIVE

02:19:49.214 --> 02:19:49.781
LOAN MODE SHARE IT REDUCES THE

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:53.351
NEED FOR SCHOOL TO BUILD

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:53.952
PARKING STRUCTURES WHEN THAT

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:54.519
LAND IS EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE

02:19:54.586 --> 02:19:57.589
USED FOR. THE BUILDINGS THAT

02:19:57.655 --> 02:19:58.123
HAVE TO DO WITH EDUCATION

02:19:58.189 --> 02:20:01.459
INSTEAD REDUCES. PARKING

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:05.563
DEMAND- COSTS CAN BE SHARED

02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:06.131
THERE WAS UCLA STUDY THAT

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:09.868
FOUND- STUDENTS ARE WILLING TO

02:20:09.934 --> 02:20:13.872
HELP PAY FOR THESE PASSES ON.

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:14.439
AND IT WAS INTERESTING LAST

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:18.042
YEAR EIGHT OF NINE ON. LA

02:20:18.109 --> 02:20:18.610
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

02:20:18.676 --> 02:20:19.244
SCHOOLS VOTED TO ADD THIRTEEN

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:22.247
DOLLARS THE STUDENTS VOTED TO

02:20:22.313 --> 02:20:22.814
CHARGE THEMSELVES AN EXTRA

02:20:22.881 --> 02:20:26.284
THIRTEEN DOLLARS PER SEMESTER

02:20:26.351 --> 02:20:26.951
TO HELP PAY FOR DISCOUNT PASSES

02:20:27.018 --> 02:20:30.755
FOR MET METRO. AND IT'S ALSO

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:31.422
INTERESTING NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:34.692
ABSENTEE ISN'T K. THROUGH

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:35.093
TWELVE IS LACK OF

02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:35.593
TRANSPORTATION AND THAT

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.227
OBVIOUSLY DRAMATICALLY REDUCES

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:39.130
THE FUNDING PER STUDENT

02:20:39.197 --> 02:20:47.205
RECEIVED BY SCHOOLS. IN. SO

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:51.476
THERE'S A CONUNDRUM YOU KNOW

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:55.480
METRO HAS A PROBLEM DESPITE

02:20:55.547 --> 02:20:56.080
RAIL BUILDING BOOM AND ALL OF

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:56.714
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:59.918
WE'RE SPENDING ON BUILDING A

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:00.518
BIGGER RAIL SYSTEM THERE IS

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:03.788
STILL RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING

02:21:03.855 --> 02:21:04.422
AND ON THE OTHER HAND- THE LA

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:08.059
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR

02:21:08.126 --> 02:21:08.660
EXAMPLE HAS A POVERTY PROBLEM

02:21:08.726 --> 02:21:12.730
SO YOU KNOW WITH 80% OF THE

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:13.264
STUDENTS. LIVING BELOW THE

02:21:13.331 --> 02:21:16.701
POVERTY LINE SO WHAT IF METRO

02:21:16.768 --> 02:21:20.738
AND LA U. S. D. HELD ONE AT.

02:21:20.805 --> 02:21:21.306
AND IN FACT THAT IS WHAT

02:21:21.372 --> 02:21:21.873
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:24.976
THERE WAS A BIG THE BOARD

02:21:25.043 --> 02:21:25.610
MEETING LAST WEEK THERE WAS A

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:29.147
BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER ON

02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:29.681
METRO COULD PROVIDE FREE.

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:33.384
TRANSIT PASSES TO K. THROUGH

02:21:33.451 --> 02:21:34.018
TWELVE OR K. THROUGH I THINK TO

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:37.589
ALL STUDENTS ACTUALLY AND- SO

02:21:37.655 --> 02:21:41.426
THEY'RE WORKING ON IT AND-

02:21:41.492 --> 02:21:41.993
INDEX BUT BUT I SHOULD ALSO

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:49.734
GOING FOR I'M SORRY YOU KNOW.

02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:50.301
EIGHT STUDENTS COULD FILL IN

02:21:50.368 --> 02:21:50.935
SEATS. DURING OFF PEAK HOUR IN

02:21:51.002 --> 02:21:54.138
THAT COULD HELP NOT ONLY

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:54.606
INCREASE TOTAL TRANSIT

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:55.206
RIDERSHIP BUT IT COULD HELP

02:21:55.273 --> 02:21:58.076
REDUCE OPERATING SUBSIDIES IT

02:21:58.142 --> 02:21:58.710
COULD CAUSE HIGHER DEMAND FOR

02:21:58.776 --> 02:22:02.280
TRANSIT WHICH ALSO TENDS TO

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:02.847
RESULT IN BETTER SERVICE. IT

02:22:02.914 --> 02:22:06.417
COULD YOU IMPROVE DECLINING

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:06.985
RIDERSHIP IT COULD PRODUCE

02:22:07.051 --> 02:22:10.822
TRAFFIC SO. THE PUBLIC THE

02:22:10.889 --> 02:22:14.792
GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD ALSO

02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:15.426
BENEFIT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AGAIN

02:22:15.493 --> 02:22:16.027
DRESSES ALL THE BIG PROBLEMS

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:19.197
TRAFFIC BY TAKING CARS OFF THE

02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:19.764
ROAD REDUCE PARKING DEMAND

02:22:19.831 --> 02:22:23.201
REDUCES AIR POLLUTION. AND

02:22:23.268 --> 02:22:23.701
AGAIN WE NEED EDUCATED

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:24.335
WORKFORCE THIS PICTURE HOWEVER

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:27.672
DOES NOT REALLY DEPICT THE

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:28.339
PROBLEM BECAUSE- THE FOR A FIVE

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:31.743
THREE THIS IS A GOOD DAY ON THE

02:22:31.809 --> 02:22:32.377
FOUR OH FIVE AS ALL THESE CARS

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:36.014
MANY OF THEM PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:36.547
HEADING TO UCLA TO GO TO

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:39.918
SCHOOL. ON IN ITS SCHOOLS

02:22:39.984 --> 02:22:40.518
ESPECIALLY BIG ONES LIKE UCLA

02:22:40.585 --> 02:22:44.122
OR YOU SEE SUN OR IS STILL A

02:22:44.188 --> 02:22:48.226
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE LOTS

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:48.860
LOTS OF. WHICH IS OF COURSE THE

02:22:48.927 --> 02:22:49.427
BIGGEST OF GREENHOUSE GAS

02:22:49.494 --> 02:23:00.905
EMISSIONS. SO THERE IS THAT WE

02:23:00.972 --> 02:23:01.572
GOT INTO THIS BUSINESS AND HAVE

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:02.206
BEEN TRYING TO WITH. AND WE'RE

02:23:02.273 --> 02:23:09.047
VERY HARD WITH MEMBER. IS THE

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:09.614
X. DIRECTOR OF MOVE LA WORK

02:23:09.681 --> 02:23:13.117
WITH CENTER BECAUSE- ON BILL

02:23:13.184 --> 02:23:13.785
THE UNC. THIS ALSO STUDENT PASS

02:23:13.851 --> 02:23:17.455
PROGRAM WHICH THE CALL AND BLUE

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:18.056
BUT- AND BEEN HOT EXTREMELY

02:23:18.122 --> 02:23:21.659
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HALF OF ALL

02:23:21.726 --> 02:23:22.226
STUDENTS FACULTY FACULTY AND

02:23:22.293 --> 02:23:22.894
STAFF NOW USE TRANSIT TO GET TO

02:23:22.961 --> 02:23:26.064
CAMPUS. AND ON. THE WAY THIS IS

02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:30.234
DONE IS THE SCHOOL PAYS PART.

02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:33.938
AND THE BIG BLUE BUS DISCOUNTS

02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:34.605
THE TRANSIT PASSES AND STUDENTS

02:23:34.672 --> 02:23:35.206
ALSO PAY A PART THEY THEY PAY

02:23:35.273 --> 02:23:38.443
NINE DOLLARS PER SEMESTER WHICH

02:23:38.509 --> 02:23:39.110
IS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY AND THEY

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:42.547
CAN RIDE ANY LINE ANY TIME FOR

02:23:42.613 --> 02:23:43.214
FREE. WHAT'S NOT FOR FREE THEY

02:23:43.281 --> 02:23:46.751
PAID NINE DOLLARS BUT ON THIS

02:23:46.818 --> 02:23:47.385
IS THE WAY IT'S DONE IS WHEN

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:51.122
STUDENTS REGISTER FOR CLASSES

02:23:51.189 --> 02:23:54.926
THEY CAN THEY DON'T OPT IN THEY

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:55.493
CAN OPT OUT BUT THEY DON'T

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.127
OFTEN. SAID THE END IS THAT IT

02:23:56.194 --> 02:23:59.297
IT OPERATES KIND OF LIKE HEALTH

02:23:59.364 --> 02:23:59.931
INSURANCE PROGRAM WE BY HEALTH

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:03.368
INSURANCE EVERYBODY PAYS PAYS A

02:24:03.434 --> 02:24:03.968
LITTLE BUT NOBODY HAS TO PAY

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:07.605
THAT MUCH AND EVERYBODY

02:24:07.672 --> 02:24:08.239
BENEFITS SO THIS IS WHAT IS

02:24:08.306 --> 02:24:08.740
BEING CALLED THE HEALTH

02:24:08.806 --> 02:24:11.609
INSURANCE MODEL. AND

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:12.076
INTERESTINGLY ON THE

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:15.980
LEGISLATURE ASKED UC IRVINE TO

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:16.614
DO A STUDY THAT STUDENT TRANSIT

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:19.917
PASSES BECAUSE WE HAD. WITH

02:24:19.984 --> 02:24:20.551
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN GOTTEN A

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:24.188
STUDENT TRANSIT PASS ON

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:24.789
GOVERNOR BROWN'S DESK. BUT HE

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:28.459
SAID HE VETOED IT AND HE SAID

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:29.060
HE NEEDED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:32.430
HOW STUDENT TRANSIT PASS

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:33.064
PROGRAMS WORKING CALIFORNIA. SO

02:24:33.131 --> 02:24:36.634
THIS STUDY WAS DONE. HELP

02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:37.235
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND IT

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:40.905
WAS JUST DELIVERY TO THE

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:45.143
LEGISLATURE. AND IT'S REALLY

02:24:45.209 --> 02:24:49.380
INTEREST. BECAUSE IT TALKS

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:50.014
ABOUT THE INSURANCE MY AND HOW

02:24:50.081 --> 02:24:50.615
THIS BE A WAY. BECAUSE I KNOW

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:53.684
YOU KNOW FREE IS SUCH A GREAT I

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:57.488
BUT FREE IS DIFFERENT. SOMEBODY

02:24:57.555 --> 02:24:58.156
HAS TO. AND WHO INTO THE LATEST

02:24:58.222 --> 02:25:02.026
CAN. METRO CAN PAY. THE SCHOOLS

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:06.097
PAY THIS CAN PAY BUT- HAVING A

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:06.764
BE FREE FOR EVERYBODY I DO KNOW

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:10.234
WHO THEN PAYS. BUT IT'S A GREAT

02:25:10.301 --> 02:25:10.868
IDEA AND I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP

02:25:10.935 --> 02:25:14.072
IT. KEEP IT UNDER CONSIDERATION.

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:18.576
SO ON AGAIN IT WAS INTERESTING

02:25:18.643 --> 02:25:19.110
BECAUSE IT FAMILY MEMBER

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:19.744
GONZALEZ HAS AB THIRTEEN FIFTY

02:25:19.811 --> 02:25:22.947
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT

02:25:23.014 --> 02:25:23.514
BILL- FLEW AT OF ASSEMBLY

02:25:23.581 --> 02:25:26.951
TRANSPORTATION IT FLEW OUT OF

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:27.552
HER APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:31.122
AND IT GOT OUT THE ASSEMBLY

02:25:31.189 --> 02:25:31.689
FLOOR SO. YOU KNOW THERE'S

02:25:31.756 --> 02:25:35.359
ALREADY MOMENTUM IN THAT AREA A

02:25:35.426 --> 02:25:39.363
MAYOR GARCETTI HAS MADE THE

02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:39.964
DASH BUS IN LOS ANGELES SPREE

02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:40.498
FOR ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE

02:25:40.565 --> 02:25:43.601
STUDENTS. THE CITY IS PAYING

02:25:43.668 --> 02:25:47.438
FOR THAT PROGRAM SAYS AGAIN

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:48.072
SOMEBODY IS PAYING EVEN THOUGH

02:25:48.139 --> 02:25:48.639
IT'S FREE. AND METRO IS NOW

02:25:48.706 --> 02:25:51.976
STUDYING HOW TO MAKE TRANSIT

02:25:52.043 --> 02:25:52.577
FREE FOR ALL STUDENTS I THINK

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:55.746
IT'S GONNA BE VERY INTERESTING

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:56.380
TO SEE. HOW THAT GOES. I THINK

02:25:56.447 --> 02:26:00.017
IT'S INTERESTING THAT SACK OR

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:04.222
TA IS ALSO MAKING STUDENTS FREE

02:26:04.288 --> 02:26:04.889
MAKING PASSES FREE FOR STUDENTS.

02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:12.663
OF THE- A WAY. IN METRO SEE

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:16.968
PHIL WANTS TO CAN CHEN HAS TO

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:17.602
PAY FOR IT TRANSIT AND MAKE IT

02:26:17.668 --> 02:26:20.872
FREE FOR P. WHICH- WHILE

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:24.976
THAT'LL BE THAT'LL BE THE DAY.

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:25.576
I MEAN I WON IT TO BE THE DAY

02:26:25.643 --> 02:26:29.580
SO I AND THEN NOW IN WOMEN.

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:33.751
HELLO HAS IN THE BILL WHICH-

02:26:33.818 --> 02:26:34.352
YOU HAVE AN ENTRY YET BUT YOU

02:26:34.418 --> 02:26:41.959
WILL. END SO NEXT. SO WE HAVE

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:42.493
WORKED WITH MEMBER HOLDEN

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:46.264
STUDENT SINCE TWENTY. LOW THIS

02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:50.101
PICTURE HE IS THE CHAIR. OF IN

02:26:50.168 --> 02:26:54.505
THAT THE TWO BILLS WE WORK ON

02:26:54.572 --> 02:26:55.139
TOGETHER THE BILLS ACTUALLY HAD

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:58.342
ALMOST YOU SUPPORT IN MAY

02:26:58.409 --> 02:26:58.910
COMMITTEES AND IT WAS BROAD

02:26:58.976 --> 02:26:59.377
SUPPORT DEMOCRATS AND

02:26:59.443 --> 02:27:02.780
REPUBLICANS IT WAS NOT IT'S NOT

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:03.347
A PARTISAN ISSUE ANYWAY AND

02:27:03.414 --> 02:27:06.784
THEN YOU KNOW WE GOT TO THE

02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:07.418
GOVERNOR'S DESK AND HE SAID NO.

02:27:07.485 --> 02:27:10.955
BUT NOW THAT THE STUDIES BEEN

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:11.522
DELIVERED WE BELIEVE THAT

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:12.123
THERE'S GOING TO BE PROGRESS

02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:15.293
THIS YEAR'S SO IT'S ALL VERY

02:27:15.359 --> 02:27:19.163
EXCITING AND I THINK THAT'S THE

02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:23.401
AGAIN. YOU KNOW HOW HELLO BUT-

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:24.035
IF THIRTEEN FIFTY IF YOUR BILL

02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:24.602
GETS ACROSS HOW WILL IT BE

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:27.939
FUNDED YOU KNOW THE CAP AND

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:28.539
TRADE PROGRAM THE GREENHOUSE

02:27:28.606 --> 02:27:31.809
GAS REDUCTION FUND IS ONE

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:32.476
POSSIBILITY IT THE STATE BUDGET

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:36.147
IS ONE POSSIBILITY YOU KNOW

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:36.747
THIS HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDING

02:27:36.814 --> 02:27:37.415
MODEL WHERE EVERYBODY PUTS IN A

02:27:37.481 --> 02:27:40.284
LITTLE MONEY. IT'S ANOTHER

02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:40.851
GREAT MODEL METRO HAS BEEN

02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:44.722
WORKING TRYING TO WORK TOWARD

02:27:44.789 --> 02:27:48.426
THAT KIND OF THE MODEL AND WE

02:27:48.492 --> 02:27:49.026
ESTIMATE BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:49.560
BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE IN

02:27:49.627 --> 02:27:52.930
SANTA MONICA IT COULD COST

02:27:52.997 --> 02:27:53.531
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION A

02:27:53.598 --> 02:27:56.767
YEAR TO PROVIDE A SUBSIDY

02:27:56.834 --> 02:27:57.401
FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER STUDENT PER

02:27:57.468 --> 02:28:01.372
YEAR. SO THAT ALL STUDENTS

02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:05.076
COULD. GET DISCOUNTED PASS

02:28:05.142 --> 02:28:05.610
ASSUMING THAT ONLY SEVENTY

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:09.580
WOULD PROTECT. LAST FRIDAY. WHO

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:13.784
KNEW WE HAD SUPPORT FROM METRO

02:28:13.851 --> 02:28:14.385
EARLY ON BEGINNING IN TWENTY.

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:17.655
AND METRO IS ALWAYS BEEN

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:18.222
INTERESTED METROS TRYING TO

02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:18.823
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THIS

02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:21.959
WORK. THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING

02:28:22.026 --> 02:28:22.593
TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK

02:28:22.660 --> 02:28:26.464

INCREASED PRICE OF THE CARBON

02:48:48.184 --> 02:48:48.785

02:48:52.422 --> 02:49:00.463
