JERRY I'M GONNA CALL THE COMMITTEE TO ORDER AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. OF WHEN WE GET A FULL QUORUM I WILL LOCK. WILL CALL THE QUORUM BUT UNTIL THEN WE CAN'T MAKE MOTIONS. BUT WE WILL START A SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE FIRST PERSON IS SANTIAGO. AND THEN COBBLER GYRO YES THERE YOU ARE CAMANO. ALRIGHT. OUR SHOW WELCOME ALL TO THE HEARING AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS COMMITTEE. I'D FIRST LIKE TO RECOGNIZE OUR MELISSA MELENDEZ AS OUR NEW MEMBER AND ALSO AS VICE CHAIR. WE SERVED TOGETHER AS CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR. FOR AWHILE AND IN NOW PUBLIC SAFETY. AND. WE COULD ALWAYS AGREE TO DISAGREE AMIABLY AND DIVERT IMMENSE RESPECT. OUR FOR. MS MELENDEZ AND. HER. CURRENT TAKE READY AND THE REASON THAT SHE SHE VOTES THE WAY SHE DOES AND. ARE. JUST I'M VERY GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE. SO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER KABBAH GYRO. I AM LET'S OH YES FIRST THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT ITEM ELEVEN AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT. WAS PULLED BY COMMITTEE FROM TODAY'S AGENDA AND WILL BE HEARD. NEXT WEEK ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND. WE ALSO HAVE TO BILLS THAT ARE CORRUPT OPPOSED TO CONSENT OF THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR CONSENT AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY ONE SOLACE. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY EIGHT CHEN AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM. A WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE VERY SHORTLY I WILL BRING THOSE CHU WOP. I WANT TO THANK. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN TODAY FOR FILLING IN FOR US AGAIN I AM VERY GLAD THAT TO IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE LET. THAT YOU ARE HERE AND THAT TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALRIGHT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. DAHLE ARROW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY THE SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITY ACT OF. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS STATEWIDE THAT CHRONICALLY SERVE CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER OR CANNOT PROVIDE THE RESIDENTS A RELIABLE WATER SERVICE. DO DO IN ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THEY LACK LOCAL FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL OR TECHNICAL RESOURCES. A VAST MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL RURAL SYSTEMS THAT TYPICALLY SERVED LESS. THAN A HUNDRED UP THEN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THERE WAS NEVER A BETTER TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE CRISIS. IN THIS SYSTEM THAN DURING THE DROUGHT WHEN WE HAD THE SYSTEM AFTER SYSTEM FAILURE AND. PEOPLE THAT WERE REALLY RELIANT ON BOTTLED WATER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT THEIR WATER NEEDS MET. NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW WOULD PRECLUDE AN UNDERPERFORMING WATER SYSTEM FROM CONSOLIDATING EITHER VOLUNTARILY OR TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. MANDATED CONSOLIDATION PROCEDURES AS OUTLINED IN S. B. EIGHTY EIGHT OR S. B. FIVE FIFTY TWO. HOWEVER CONSOLIDATIONS ARE COMPLEX. AND. KOMPLEKS TO EXECUTE A MUST ADDRESS THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE REGION AND THE SITUATION THAT HAS RESULTED IN THE SYSTEM FAILURE. TRADITIONAL CONSOLIDATIONS MUCH RICK MUST RELY ON A LARGER HOST AGENCY TO FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION. THE LARGER SYSTEM MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT THE CONSOLIDATION DOES NOT IMPACT ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS. AB TWENTY FIFTY PROVIDES A SOLUTION BY MERGING SMALL NONCOMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS INTO A LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. STREAMLINED MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND THE MERGE SYSTEMS WILL BE FORMED AS INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND PROVIDED WITH NEW INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY INCLUDED. INCLUDING AN ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE NEW AUTHORITIES WILL BE SCALED TO A SIZE TO DEVELOP. COORDINATE OUR CONTRACT THROUGH LOCAL REGIONAL AGREEMENTS THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE TO TREAT CONTAMINATION ISSUES. THIS IN TURN WILL LEAD TO MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY DELIVER SAFE. AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AB TWENTY FIFTY ESTABLISHES A ROADMAP FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND DOES NOT RELY ON A LARGER HOST AGENCY WHICH IS IMPORTANT. AS MANY OF THE SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE ADJACENT TO A LARGER SYSTEM THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT REAL RURAL CALIFORNIA. STATE BOARD WILL NOTIFY THE CHRONICALLY NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS THAT THEY ARE IN VIOLATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. EACH SYSTEM WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. IF A PLAN IS NOT APPROVED BY THE STATE BOARD THEY WILL NOTIFY THE LOCAL THAT COUNTY LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION OR LAUGH GO. THAT CHRONICALLY NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE COUNTY WILL BE DISSOLVED AND CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE IT INTO AN AUTHORITY. WITH ME IN SUPPORTOF AB TWENTY FIFTY TODAY ARE DON GILBERT REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA MUTUAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND PAUL RODGERS GENERAL MANAGER EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DON GILBERT REPRESENTING WELL WE ALLOW FOR MINUTES. USUALLY TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. RICHARD ON GILBERT REPRESENTING AT CMU WAY CMU AIDS MEMBERS. PROVIDE WATER TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS. AND. AS PROGRESSIVE SOLUTION ORIENTED AGENCIES. THOSE MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS REGULAR ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIFTY WHICH IS A SMART AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. TO A STRUGGLING WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF A WATER SYSTEM ROOM REQUIRES TECHNICAL MANUFAKTUR AND MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS TMF. TECHNICAL CAPACITY MEANS HAVING ADEQUATE DRINKING WATER RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE AND TREATMENT. MANAGERIAL CAPACITY MEANS HAVING HIGHLY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY MEANS HAVING SUFFICIENT REVENUE. TO COVER CAPITAL COSTS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND AS WELL AS BEING CREDIT WORTHY AND HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCE. NOT ALL WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TMF THESE SYSTEMS ARE THOSE THE ONES THAT ARE CHRONICALLY NON. AND AS A RESULT THEY DON'T PROVIDE RELIABLE CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO THEIR RESIDENTS. THE EPA HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MANAGERIAL CAPACITY COMPONENTS OF THIS TMF FORMULA IF YOU WILL. IS WHAT ALSO ENABLES TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SHORT COMING IN ENABLES A AGENCIES TO OVERCOME TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SHORTCOMINGS COMINGS AND BE PROPERLY OPERATED. SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM. AB TWENTY FIFTY IS A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION IT ESTABLISHES AS THE AUTHOR SAID A SMALL LITTLE SMALL WATER SYSTEM. AND IT DOES THIS BY CREATING A LAUGH CHO DRIVEN PROCESS. IN WHICH ALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS CAN AGGREGATE TO BECOME ONE FUNCTIONAL WATER SYSTEM. THIS PROVIDES IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. LARGE A LARGER RATE BASE STREAMLINED AND MORE ACCURATE AND ITS AREA FUNCTIONS MINUTES I IS THERE ANOTHER SPEAKER. YES OKAY IMBIBE JUST WRAP UP OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO FOR. IT PROVIDES IS VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES AB THROUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND FOR THAT REASON WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD AS ONE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX FOR A LARGE PROBLEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON PAUL JONES GENERAL MANAGER OF EASTER MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT WHICH IS AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES WATER WASTEWATER RECYCLE WATER SERVICES FOR ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. UP OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST TWO DECADES I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL WATER AGENCIES CONSOLIDATION CENTER RESULTANT. RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER INFRASTRUCTURE RELIABILITY AND SERVICE. HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN A CONSOLIDATION OF A PRIVATE WATER SYSTEM THAT HAD BEEN SERVING CONTAMINATE WATER IS SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED. AS MENTIONED EARLIER FOR SMALL STRUGGLING SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATIONS WITH LARGER HOSTS AGENCIES CAN BE EFFECTIVE BUT EVEN THOSE CONSOLIDATIONS BETWEEN WILLING PARTNERS CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED. I AB TWENTY FIFTY CERTAINLY UNIQUE BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A NEW CONSOLIDATION MECHANISM. WHERE MULTIPLE CHRONICALLY FAILING SYSTEMS ARE DISSOLVED AND THEN REFORMED INTO LARGER COMPETENT AGENCIES THAT HAVE TECHNICAL MANAGER OWN FINANCIAL CAPABILITIES? A ACCESS. TO TAX EXEMPT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. HERE OF THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE SYSTEMS. THAT ARE IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S DATABASE IS BEING CHRONICALLY NONCOMPLIANT. EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF THEM SERVE LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE FOUR HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTION SO THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ARE JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO REALIZE. THAT COURSE AB TWENTY FIFTY ADDRESSES THIS BY COMBINING THE SYSTEMS AT A COUNTY OR SUB COUNTY LEVEL. BUT FINALLY I'D LIKE TO MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL BUT TO ENSURE OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY AB TWENTY FIFTY. BUILDS IN A POST FORMATION OVERSIGHT PROCESS WITH AN INDEPENDENT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE START UP IN FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THESE NEW SYSTEMS AND THAT'S DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE BOARD. STRAIGHT TREASURERS OFFICE AND LAUGH CHO SO WE BELIEVE. THROUGH THIS BILL THEIR BEER A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL NUMBER OF FAILING WATER SYSTEMS AND THAT THE NEW SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITIES WILL COMPETENTLY DELIVER. SAFE RELIABLE DRINKING WATER TOO MANY COMMUNITIES IN NEED. ENDS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO OTHERS SHOT IN SUPPORT NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. LARA PART IN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST HUNDRED AYE JOGO THE CLOCK A GROUP ON BEHALF OF LONG BEACH WATER DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS COMMONSENSE APPROACH. ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND TO THANK YOU. TODD MAINLY WITH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. VERY GOOD ARM ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. THERE BEING NONE OUR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. YES MISS VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO. ASSEMBLY WOMAN AYE I VERY MUCH LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL BY I HAVE A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS TO. RELATIVELY MINOR AND AN WHEN IN THE BIG PICTURE AND ONE IT'S VERY MAJOR TO ME. FOR SOME REASON THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THESE NEW DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE PAID NEARLY DOUBLE THAN OTHER MUNICIPAL WATER BOARD MEMBERS. ACCORDING TO MY ANALYSIS I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT IS. YOU GUYS ARE SHAKING YOUR HEADS NOW SELL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE. NO NO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE AT ALL. NOT SURE WHY WHY THAT'S COME UP IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. OKAY. I AM. THREE YEARS TO PAY BACK. THE ORIGINAL OWNERS. CORRECT. THREE YEAR THREE YEARS TO PAY BACK AND THAT'S. I'M WONDERING WHY IT'S THE IT'S NOT SEEN AS A LONG. JEFF THEY WAS OUR CONTEMPLATION GIVEN THE MAKING IT. EVEN A YEAR LESS THAN THAT EARNED. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M IT THIS THIS IS ON. I THINK THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS IS THAT ALL OF THESE ARE NON COMPLIANT WATER DISTRICTS ARE. UP FINANCIALLY STRAPPED LEAGUE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. UNCONTAMINATED A DRINKING WATER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO BE ABLE TO. GO THROUGH THIS CONSOLIDATION PROCESS. GET A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON BECAUSE THERE THERE WILL BE A CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP. HIRE THE STAFF THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOW BECOME COMPLAINT WITH STATE LAW AND WE WANT TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH TIME TO BE ABLE TO PAY OFF ANY DEBTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE DOING THAT THAT THAT. THE PROCESS AND. PART OF THAT PART OF THE BENEFIT OF DOING THESE CONSOLIDATIONS ISN'T THERE REALLY IS STATE MONEY IT AT THE WATER BOARD FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BUT THESE PARTICULAR WATER. DISTRICTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE OUR WATER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT THERE. THAT. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF THAT ONCE THEY IF THEY COULD GET A GRANT THAT COULD ACTUALLY EXECUTED SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT. THAT THAT IT'S THE BITS THE M.. THAT THE NEW BOARD. HIRING NEW STAFF AND BRINGING THE MOM BOARD IT MAY TAKE THEM AWHILE TO BE ABLE TO PAY. THEIR OBLIGATIONS BACK AND FRANKLY IF THEY CAN GET IT DONE IN ONE OR TWO YEARS THAT'S GREAT BUT WE DON'T WANT IT SET THEM UP FOR FAILURE IMMEDIATELY BY HAVING THEM PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY. ON THIS VERY DIFFICULT. THAT'S A THOUGHT. OKAY. I STILL THINK THREE YEARS IS A LONG TIME DEBT BUT I I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT I THINK FLY IN THIS BILL FOR ME IS THAT THERE'S NO VOTER APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR ISSUING THESE BONDS AND I FIND THAT VERY TROUBLESOME. WHICH IS WHY I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I'M I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ROOM FOR NEGOTIATING ON THAT BUT. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF IF THE RATE PAYERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR THESE BONDS THAT THEY HAVE A SAY IN WHETHER NOT THOSE BONDS ARE ISSUED AND I THINK IF THEY HAVE. CONTINUED OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED. CONTAMINATED WATER NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER IT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY WANT TO PAY INTO THOSE IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO. TO ISSUE THESE BONDS WITHOUT VOTER APPROVAL AM I I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY COULD I USE THE REFERENDUM PROCESS IF THEY WEREN'T SATISFIED WITH THIS BUT THAT IS PUTTING THE BURDEN. ON THE RATEPAYERS AT THE BACK AND RATHER THAN PUTTING THE BURDEN ON THE WATER DISTRICT AT THE FRONT AND WHICH I THINK MAKES MORE SENSE OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOLLOW. DO YOU HAVE OF WATER DISTRICTS OF THIS TYPE IN YOUR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. I DO I HAVE VIA. YES I DO. OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. IT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALRIGHT. I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BELT TO MOVE FORWARD. I NOTE THAT THE WATER AGENCIES IN THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE WERE BY AND LARGE IN SUPPORT. ARM AND I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PARTICULAR WE HEAR FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS SOME OF WHICH ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE PART OF THIS CONSOLIDATION. SO I'M MERGING AND I VOTE AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISHED. WILL ASK FOR MOTION AND WILL GO AHEAD WITH GETTING THE VOTE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING HIS THINK ALIGNMENT YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT NEXT IS SANTIAGO. AND IF NOT THEN CALDERON YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO LIST ALL INGREDIENTS ON THE LABELS OF PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. EXCEPT FOR THOSE PROTECTED BY TRADE SECRETS TO PROVIDE OPEN INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS LINE WORKERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. THOSE USES LAUNCH ON A DAILY BASIS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE LABELED. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY APPLY THE EXISTING INDUSTRY LABELING REQUIREMENT FOR RETAIL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS. WHILE RETAIL BECAUSE MARRIAGE ARE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC FOR LIVESTOCK CONSUMPTION PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS ARE USED BY SALON WORKERS FOR UPWARDS OF EIGHT HOURS A DAY. RESULTING IN MANY CASES OF ACUTE DISAPPEAR HEALTH SYMPTOMS. AB IS TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE GIVE SALON WORKERS AND CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO VIEW INGREDIENTS AND OPEN WAY. THAT IS ALREADY STANDARDIZED CROSS OUR FOOD HOME PRODUCTS AND RETAIL COSMETICS. SINCE MY INTRODUCTION OF THIS CONCEPT LAST YEAR WE EVER KNEW MOVED ALL OPPOSITION AND IT PROBABLY PROCEED THE SUPPORT.

OTHER MANUFACTURERS ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO LIST INGREDIENTS ON THE LABELS OF COSMETICS SOLD AT THE RETAIL LEVEL. LEADS RETAIL LEVEL THEY HAVE NO SIMILAR LEGAL OBLIGATION IT COMES TO PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL FILL.

MISTER SANTIAGO I THINK IS STILL NOT HERE THE NEXT PERSON IS A MISTER FONG. AND LA I FIRST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING. WITH THE STAFF YOU BOUGHT US A REAL PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE'VE GOTTA. SOMETHING THAT I HOPE BECOMES A REAL SOLUTION AFFECTED AS CHAIR. I THINK MR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL HELL BE ACCEPTING THE MINUTES REFLECTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. BOB AND AGAIN MISTER CHAIR I GREATLY APPRECIATE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IN YOUR GUIDANCE ON THIS MATTER. AB TWENTY SIX OF SIX WAS STREAMLINED A HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT RENEWAL PROCESS FOR FACILITIES THAT HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. AND PLACES CAPS ON PERMIT FEES DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FACILITY. THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC AND SUBSTANCES TO CONTROL HAS BEEN FACING A SEVERE BACKLOG THE PROCESS FOR THE FACILITY PERMITS. IN PARTICULAR ANNUAL PERMITS AS A RESULT MANY FACILITIES HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER EXPIRED PERMITS. UP. ADDITIONALLY THE COST TO RENEW THESE FEES HAVE SKYROCKETED CREATING UNCERTAINTY FROM MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AS WELL AS PRIVATE INDUSTRY A IN MY DISTRICT THE NAVAL WEAPONS STATION CHINA LAKE. IS ONE SUCH CASE. A TITLE LIKE IT'S OUR NATION'S PREMIER RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT TEST AND I WOULD CONSIDER FOR EXISTING AND FUTURE WEAPON SYSTEMS. IT UP. BUT THIS INSULATION IS PARAMOUNT FOR NATION'S SECURITY HIS FREQUENT USE BY OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS CHINA LAKE HAS BEEN OPERATING WITH AN EXPIRED PERMIT. THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE MISSION OF CHINA LAKE HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE FACILITY HAS MAINTAINED FOR COMPLAINTS. BUT CERTAINLY TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE HAS BEEN SEEN ITS COSTS FOR RENEWAL PERMITS GO FROM THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A NEARLY TENFOLD INCREASE EVEN OF THE FACILITY. HAS NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES AND HAS AN EXEMPLARY COMPLAINTS RECORD. THIS BILL CREATED STREAMLINED AND MARK FISHER PERMITTING PROCESS FOR FACILITATOR LAKE AND TRAVIS AIRFORCE BASE. I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THE GREAT WORK WE'VE DONE ON THIS BILL WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE COMMITTEE SO THAT WE ULTIMATELY HAVE A VIABLE SYSTEM THAT ENABLES FACILITIES TO HANDLE WASTE. WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF PROTECTION FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE ENVIRONMENT. I WITH ME TODAY TO SATISFY SUPPORT IS RENTAL FRIEDMAN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE US DEPARTMENT THE NAVY SOUTHWEST DIVISION. ALRIGHT. FOUR MINUTE SHOWER TO REACH UNLESS YOU WANTED DIVIDED UP DIFFERENTLY. PLEASE GO AHEAD CHAIR QUIRK MEMBERS I AM RANDALL FRIEDMAN AND I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE SEVEN MILITARY HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. EACH OF OUR PERMITTED FACILITIES INCLUDING THE ONE IN THE AUTHORS DISTRICT PERFORM VITAL FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY MISSION. THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL INVITED US TO MAKE A PRESENTATION ON OUR EXPERIENCES WITH OUR EFFORTS TO RENEW OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMITS. IN DOING SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PROCESS ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS BILL DIES. AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE. OF THE CONCERN PLAN COULD BE SUPPORTED MORE BROADLY. IT ENSURES THAT A FACILITY ONLY QUALIFIES FOR THIS PROCESS IF IT HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION. TO YEARS PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. HAS HAD NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN OPERATIONS HAS HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND HAS NOT HAD SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC CONCERNS. THIS BILL INCENTIVIZE IS GOOD BEHAVIOR. MANY HAVE COMMENTED THE ENFORCEMENT COMPLIANCE PROCESS IS BROKEN. COMMITTEE STAFFS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS PROVIDE A STRATEGY FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TNC. TO REWARD GOOD COMPLIANCE WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE GOOD. THE GOOD ACTORS TO PROCEED IN A STREAMLINED FASHION WHILE ENABLING DGSE TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON MORE COMPLEX AND ENVIRONMENTALLY CHALLENGING FACILITIES. I WOULD ADD HERBS TO THEIR AD STAFF ANALYSIS TRAVIS AIRFORCE BASE IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF RENEWING THEIR APPLICATION. AND IS CONTINUING WORK WITH DTS SEE ON A REVIEW OF THEIR COST ESTIMATE. IN CONCLUSION THAT DEPARTMENT DEFENSES IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ALICE'S WE THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US. X.. TO CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHRIS MAUER ON BEHALF OF CLEAN HARBORS TO SAFETY CLEAN WHICH TOGETHER OWN AND OPERATE FOURTEEN FACILITIES PERMITTED IN CALIFORNIA. ADJUST TO ECHO MISTER FRIEDMAN'S COMMENTS. I THINK THAT THAT THE BILL AS PROPOSED HE MEANT IT IS A GOOD FIRST STEP MOVING FORWARD. TOWARDS OUR. A REJECTING SOME FAIRNESS AND EQUITY BACK INTO THE. PERMITTING PROCESS YEAH I APPRECIATE. MR FUNG'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELL MISTER CHAIR I KNOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW IT'S AND WE. WE'VE CONVEYED YOU THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DAT A ISSUE FOR OUR FACILITIES SO OF A URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. OF OTHERS IN SUPPORT. JEAN IRVINE REPRESENT WASTE MANAGEMENT OTHER LICENSEES. IT'S UNLIKELY MY CLIENTS AVAIL THOUGH INVOKE THIS BUT IF WE CAN. CONSERVE RESOURCES IN ONE AREA AND CONCENTRATED IN THE HARDER PERMITS PERHAPS WE ALL BENEFIT SO WE SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. JOHN KEPT HIM Q. CAP CAN ASSIST IT'S ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY SENSATIONAL SINCE. GOOD AFTERNOON AT A RALLY WITH CAL CHAMBER WE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. VERY GOOD. ALL OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS IN ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AYE WE ARE VERY CONCERNED. THAT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW. A HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY APPLICATIONS TO BYPASS NORMAL DTS HE REVIEW ON A VERY. SHORT TIME FRAME. THE EXISTING BACKLOG OF THE PERMITTING MAKES A NINETY DAY REVIEW. PROCESS AND WHAT WE'VE CHANGED THAT. IT'S NOT A NINETY DAY REVIEW PROCESS. A PROCESS NOW THAT WE'VE AGREED TO IS FOR THE GOOD ACTORS WHO HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEMS. THAT IF THEY SUBMIT A. TOM TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE THEY SUBMIT THE RENEWAL. THE AGENCY THEN HAS UP UNTIL SIX MONTHS PASSED THE RENEWAL. TO. APPROVE IT. NOW CLEARLY. IF. THEY HAVEN'T GONE ALL THROUGH ALL THE PROCEDURES THERE WOULD THEN BE A LAWSUIT. SO THEY ARE DEFINITELY. IF THEY'RE GONNA FINISH THEY HAVE DO IT RIGHT. JUST SAINTS OF THE NINETY DAYS THAT WAS ORIGINALLY THERE. THE DIFFICULTY WITH THAT WAS THAT EVEN IF FOR NINETY YEARS IF THAT'S NOT DONE RIGHT. PERMIT ISN'T GONNA STAND SO WE ASSUME THAT. A PERMIT WILL BE DONE CORRECTLY AND WE'RE GET BASICALLY GIVING PEOPLE TWO AND A HALF YEARS NOT NINETY DAYS SO IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. THAN THE ORIGINAL BELL THANK YOU SOME OF THE CONCERNS OTHER REMAIN THE SAME ARM WHEREBY WHEN YOU ALLOW. WHEN YOU ALLOW DTS CD OR YOU FORCE THE TSC TO APPROVE A PERMIT WHEN IT DOESN'T ACT IN A TIMELY FASHION THE LOSE IN THAT CASE ARE THE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE BY THESE FACILITIES. WE NEED THOROUGH REVIEW IN EVERY CASE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT DTS HE HAS A PROBLEM WITHIN WITH MAKING TIMELY DECISIONS. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A. THAT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES THE RIGHT PROBLEM ON. SO. WE WOULD URGE THAT THERE BE MORE CONSIDERATION ON HOW TO INCENTIVIZE DTS  <u><c.green>TO MAKE</c></u> TIMELY DECISIONS. INCLUDING AND UP TO AT AB ABOARD AN APPEALS MORE THAT CAN REVIEW THESE TYPES OF DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE NOT MADE IN A TIMELY FASHION. BUT SIMPLY ALLOWING A A FACILITY PERMIT TO BE GRANTED WHEN DTC FAILS ACT IN A TIMELY FASHION. AGAIN DOESN'T NECESSITATE ARM OR OR REQUIRE THE COMPLEX TECHNICAL REVEAL ALWAYS TO BE COMPLETED AND THAT'S THE CONCERN IS WENDY BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON AND MAINLY YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE. HAS SOME PROBLEMS ARM YOU KNOW WE STILL NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT REVIEW IS BECAUSE IS IS COMPLETE ARM AND THAT COMMUNITIES NEARBY THESE FACILITIES ARE COMPLETED. I'M WE ALSO. HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE AT CAP FOR THE COSTS ON THAT PROVIDES A WINDFALL TO THE HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITIES WHEN WE SAY THAT. DID YOU SEE CANNOT CHARGE OVER CERTAIN AMOUNT I AGREE THAT YES YOU HAVE TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF. A OF OF ITS COSTS IN CONTAINING THOSE BUT BY PUTTING AND. AN ABSOLUTE CAP ON YOU EXIT PASS THE COST ONTO THE TAXPAYERS WINDY TSC DOES INEVITABLY ARM HAVE COSTS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE CAP PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANNA BASKETS I'M HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ARMS TO SLIDE CENTER DEATHLY ONE ALLY MY COMMENTS TO. THAT WHICH IS STATED BY INGRID BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO REALLY CONTINUE THIS COMPETITION IF THE BILL MOVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE I'M GIVEN THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS TO HAVE TO REALLY LOOK AT A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM. NOT JUST LOOKING AT A SPECIFICALLY THE CAPS OR THE APPLICATION PROCESS OF PERMITS HAVE PERMITS ARGUMENT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THERE'S A LOT OF MORE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN THERE'S OTHER BILLS IN THE SKY IN THIS HOUSE THAT WE'RE. WORKING WITH AND ALSO IN THE SECOND HOUSE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE STUFF. VERY GOOD OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. A MORENO ON BEHALF OF CIRCLE CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE REASONS STATED EMPHASIZED BY THE SPEAKERS AYE WE OPPOSE THE BILL. I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THE SENATE FROM BERMAN HEALTH BE POSSIBLE.

THINK HERE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE WOULD PROVIDE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR OUR OWN HOMEOWNERS WHOSE HOMES ARE CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD BASED PAINT. THIS WOULD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO SEEK DAMAGES FOR CLEAN UP OR OTHERWISE IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN CLEANUP WITHOUT FEAR OF LIABILITY LAWSUITS. EXPOSURE TO LEAD TO LEAD THE CAN SERIOUSLY HARM A CHILD'S HEALTH. EVEN A SLIGHT ELEVATION IN BLOOD LEVELS CAN REDUCE IQ AND SENT DEVELOPMENT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ARE BEING DIAGNOSED AND EX BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD IN THEIR HOMES THROUGH AGING LEAD BASED PAINT. INCREASING THEIR RISK FOR DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM SLOWED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS HEARING AND SPEECH PROBLEMS. IN TWO THOUSAND A COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN ONE ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST THREE MAJOR PAINT MANUFACTURERS THAT FOUND THE FORMER LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING LEAD PAINT FOR USE IN HOMES DESPITE THEIR KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRODUCT WAS HIGHLY TOXIC. IN SPITE OF THE COURT'S FINDING THE PAINT MANUFACTURERS ARE PROPOSING AN INITIATIVE FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATEWIDE BALLOT THAT WOULD RELIEVE PAIN MANUFACTURES OF VIABILITY. AND DO THE ACTIONS BY MULTIPLE COURTS AND PUT THE SOUL FINANCE RESPONSIBILITY ON CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS FOR CLEANUP. LEAD CONTAMINATED PAINT. IF ENACTED THE INITIATIVE WOULD COST TAXPAYERS THREE POINT NINE BILLION. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE WILL ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS HAVE LEAD BASED PAINT. THAT HAVE LEAD BASED PAINT CANNOT BE SUED BY THE LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS IT ALSO. ENSURES THAT THE LEAD PAINT AND PAINT MANUFACTURERS REMAIN AND WILL STILL BE LIABLE FOR THEIR LEAD CONTAMINATION REGARDLESS OF FAILURE. OR PASSAGE OF THE INITIATIVE BASED ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT THE SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE PROPOSAL. WITH ME TODAY IS BILL ALLEY GOOD WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP TO SPEAK ON THE TEXAS TALKS JUST TALKS IT'S CITY. ASPECTS OF LET. I BILL ALLEY OPEN WITH EWG THAT WERE NOT FORMALLY LISTEN IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE WILL BE ALONG WITH OTHERS IN A COALITION. THAT ARE. WORKING AGAINST THE INITIATIVE THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REFERENCE TO END OF FOR A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT IS OUR AYE. OF SIN NOT HAVE A SYNOPSIS IN YOUR. ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL INCLUDING ONE BY THE CHAIR. WE ARE OF A. ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PACKAGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LED TO AN ANY LEVEL. IS HIGHLY TOXIC IN THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD ACCORDING TO SEVERAL. ESTABLISHED HELP ORGANIZATIONS. DE INITIATIVE THAT. THE MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT IS INTERESTING IN THAT IT WOULD SAY THAT IT REDEFINES LEAD IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE WHICH IS EXACTLY. THE TERM OF ART THAT THEY LOST ON IN COURT SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST AND THEY WANT TO SAY THE HOMEOWNERS CAN BORROW MONEY TO CLEAN UP LEAD WHEN THEY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET OFF THE HOOK. THE PACKAGE OF BILLS INCLUDING THIS ONE WILL HELP ENSURE THE HOMEOWNERS ARE PROTECTED IN TERMS OF LIABILITY. AND WE GET THE MONEY GOING IN FLOWING TO CLEAN UP THIS HISTORIC LEAD PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR OUR NEXT WITNESS. IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON KEPT HE WITH MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE HOMES WITH INTERIOR LEAD BASED PAINT HAVE BEEN BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED AN INTACT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF A RECENT COURT RULING ALL HOMES WITH INTERIOR LEAD BASED PAINT ARE NOW DEEMED PUBLIC NUISANCE AS WAS NOTED. BETWEEN THE COURT RULING AND THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE CMT IS CONCERNED THAT WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE DONE THE RIGHT THING. LAYERING THE COURT CASE DEMAND SUCH HOMES WITH US PUBLIC NUISANCES WITH THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE THAT WOULD MAKE SUCH HOMES HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES. IS CONCERNING AS WE DON'T BELIEVE IT HAS ANY BENEFIT FOR HOMEOWNERS IN FACT SEE MTA'S HIGHLY CONCERNED THAT ACTUALLY EXACERBATES AND ORDER IT ALREADY PROBLEMATIC SITUATION. FOR MANY FAMILIES HAVE PROPERLY MAINTAIN THEIR HOMES THEY WILL BE DOUBLY PENALIZED BY THE COURT RULING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS AS WELL AS AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE D. MEAN THEIR HOME A HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE. WELL THE BILL INTENDS TO PROVIDE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR THESE HOMEOWNERS RUFF'S HOUSE HAVE SUCH HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE HOMES. IT IS AT THE SAME TIME DECIMATING PROPERTY VALUES FOR HOMEOWNERS AND CALIFORNIANS. HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVELIHOODS TRYING TO AFFORD A HOME IN AN ALREADY COSTLY I'M STATE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP. FURTHER WHAT ABOUT THE LANDLORDS AND THAT A CHECK I AM HAVE NOT PROPERLY MAINTAINED THEIR HOMES AND PREPARE THEIR PROPERTIES AND WORKFARE WHO ARE FAILING TO DO SO WHO IN FAILING TO DO SO. ARE ACTUALLY THE REAL PROBLEM EXPOSING THE RANCHERS TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN LEAD BASED PAINT. AB TWENTY DOES THREE AND THE LIABILITY PROTECTION WILL BE EXTENDED TO THOSE NEGLIGENT LANDLORDS AS WELL AYE WHICH RAISES ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. ULTIMATELY SANTEE BELIEVES THAT THE COURT'S FINDING OF PUBLIC NUISANCE AS A HOST OF NEGATIVE IN CHALLENGING IMPLICATIONS FOR HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE YOUTHS PERFORMANCE YOU'VE USED ABOUT THREE MINUTES I'M WRAPPING IT DOES IDEA I. OBESE MEN WANNA HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESSING HERE CMJ LOOKS FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE ABOUT A GOOD SOLUTION NOT TO THE CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. I WILL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN HIS LIFE REMARKS QUITE SHORT AGAIN ANTHONY SAMPSON. OUT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SO OUT I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ALL OF THE UNDERSTANDING NOW THAT WE HAVE A A DECISION ON RECORD. THAT DECLARES ITS PUBLIC NUISANCE THE HOMES WITHIN THE ELEVEN JURISDICTIONS. SUBJECT TO THE SENATE CAR CLARA COUNTY CASE. AND SO WHAT WE ARE NOW GOING TO SEE WITH THIS LEGISLATION AS MISS KEPT HE POINTED OUT IS THAT THOSE HOMES AS SUBJECT TO THAT CASE IN ADDITION TO EVERY OTHER. HOME IN CALIFORNIA WITH LEAD BASED PAINT WOULD BE. DECLARED A SUPERFUND SITE. WITHIN THE LAW. SO IT'S. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE NEED THAT'S THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THAT. THE REMEDIATION EFFORTS THAT WILL BE DONE PURSUANT. TO THE CASE AS PUBLIC NUISANCES AT THAT ON TOP OF THAT HAVE DTS SEE. HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER REMEDIATION FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF. HOMES BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ARE PRESUMED TO HAVE LEAD BASED PAINT. IS THE TYPE OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT WE WANT TO PURSUE PARTICULARLY WITH ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THIS COMMITTEE AND ELSEWHERE. WITH RESPECT TO TSC HAVING. TROUBLE MAINTAINING ITS CURRENT A SUITE OF SUPERFUND SITES THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ARM GO AHEAD MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU I OF. HAVE QUESTIONS TO THE OPPONENTS I MEAN. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL IS AT THIS. THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMEOWNER IS NOT HELD LIABLE. FOR THE. LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS KNOWING USE OF THEIR PRODUCT AND HOMES BY. DON'T SEE. A GUY I DON'T REALLY. HERE EITHER OF YOU ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. SO THE BILL I AM DOES CERTAINLY SPEAK TO LARGELY THE LIABILITY FACTOR FOR HOMEOWNERS BUT ADDITIONALLY AS THE WAY THE BILL IS CONSTRUCTED IN AND AROUND. THE HAZARDOUS GUYS SUBSTANCE ACCOUNT ACT ALSO IN DOING SO. DESIGNATES THESE HOMES ALLIES HAZARDOUS WASTE SUPERFUND SITES AND SO IT'S THE COMBINATION OF THE PUBLIC NUISANCE COURT RULING. AT THAT ALREADY IS BECAUSE IT IS BASICALLY DEEMING THOSE HOMES A PUBLIC NUISANCE YOU UP ON TOP OF THAT THE FACT THAT. UNDER THIS BILL AYE THOSE HOMES WOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED SUPERFUND SITES SO FROM A HOMEOWNER PERSPECTIVE AS WELL YOU'RE ALSO HAVING IMPLICATIONS FOR PROPERTY VALUES. AND. AN INTERN AS WELL WITH HOMEOWNERS HAVE MEAN LIABILITY PROTECTIONS PERHAPS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CONVERSATION TO BE HAD AROUND NEAR THE SUBSET OF HOMEOWNERS WHO'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING. PEERING COMPASS SEEN EVERYONE INCLUDING LANDLORDS WHO HAVE MAY HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT AND ULTIMATELY OVERLAIN ALL OF THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOMEOWNERS AND WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE THEIR HOMES DEEMED SUPERFUND SITES. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN PROP DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT IN TERMS OF PROPERLY MAINTAINING THEIR HOMES MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NO CHIPPING IN ON THE WALLS OF THE OF THEIR PAINT. AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO THE COMBINATION OF ALL OF THAT BUT THIS BILL IS NOT MAKING HOMES A SUPERFUND SITE DOES THE COURT. DECISION AND SO THIS BILL IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE NOT HELD LIABLE. SO THOUGH QUIRK HE SAYS I UNDERSTAND IT ACTUALLY DEEMS ARE THE HOMES PUBLIC NUISANCES I WHICH IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM JEANNINE AND MANKIND SUPERFUND HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES WHICH UNDER THE CONSTRUCTED THIS BILL. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY DEALS WITH THE HAZARDOUS WASTE SUPERFUND COMPONENT. PUBLIC NUISANCE PIECES A SEPARATE PEACE DEALT WITH BY THE COURT SO IT'S TWO SEPARATE COMPONENTS. THAT WHEN PAIRED TOGETHER EXACERBATING THE CHALLENGES FOR HOMEOWNERS RELATIVE TO PROPERTY VALUES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ABOUT SO WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE DISCUSSION RELATIVE TO KIND OF LIABILITY PROTECTION. ON IT IT'S NOT JUST THE CONCERNED AT THE CHALLENGES WITHOUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSE IT IS WASTE SITES NOW. RELATIVE TO THESE HOMES AND AS WE KNOW IN CONSUMERS AND HOME PRICES ARE NOT. AT FOUR DOUBLE IN MOST PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO WHEN YOU'RE LAYING ARENA PUBLIC NUISANCE DESIGNATION FOR THESE HOMES. WHICH IS ALREADY GOING TO INEVITABLY IMPACT HOMES HOME VALUES AND IMPLICATIONS FROM THAT. AS WELL AS ON TOP OF THAT LAYER IN THE FACT THAT THESE WOULD NOW BE SUPERFUND SITE HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES EUROPE FURTHER COMPOUNDING THE FACT THAT THE HOMEOWNERS VALUE IN THEIR HOME. WHEN THEY GO TO SELL THEY HAVE TO REPORT THAT AS PART OF THERE'D BE TERMS ANOTHER SALE AND THAT'LL IN INEVITABLY IMPACT OKAY ABOUT LET ME JUST INTERVENE HERE. SO THEY ALREADY HAVE TO SAY IF THEY HAVE LEAD PAINT. THEY AREN'T WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN DECLARED A PUBLIC NUISANCE WHAT THE BILL IS DOING IS SAYING THAT. THE HOMEOWNERS NOT RESPONSIBLE. I IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS THE SUPERFUND FOUGHT SITE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS. THIS IS GOING TO JUDICIARY NEXT IN SHOULD I GO OUT THE COMMITTEE. ARM THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THAT CAN BE DEALT WITH IN JUDICIARY WE DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THIS COMMITTEE SIDE RATHER NOT. RATHER YOU YOU TOO CAN JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE AND I CAN WAIT FOR JUDICIARY TED TO GIVE US THAT. IF THEY ARE SUPERFUND SITES I'M SURE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL WILL DEAL WITH THAT AT THE TIME. SO WE WILL WE WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO THEM. OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE MUSLIM ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD CHAU ARM. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT THE HOMEOWNERS I HAVE HEARD YOUR CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION. AND DOES CERTAINLY IF IF THEY'RE VALID THESE ARE THINGS THAT THE AUTHOR MUST ADDRESS. AND. TO ME. THIS IS IT. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL NOW TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS. AND DOES SO I WILL BE OUR JEANNE AND I VOTE I'D LIKE A MOTION FROM THE. FROM THE MEMBERS. MOVED BY MISTER MURATSUCHI SECONDED BY. MISTER HOLDEN. ALRIGHT. MADAM SECRETARY DECISION I DO PASS AND ONTO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY A MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE. AND STAFF. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL I MISS YOU FROM MY DAYS ON THIS COMMITTEE. THE MESSAGE THAT IS GREAT TO HAVE ELEVEN THAT ANOTHER LAN THIS WITH THIS TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL THE. I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO RELATING TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE LITHIUM ION BATTERY RECYCLING IN YOU AND REUSE. THERE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT BIG VEHICLES ON CALIFORNIA ROADS CURRENTLY AND THAT NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO CLIMB TO WELL OVER FOUR MILLION. BY. BY TWENTY THIRTY. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S NEW PLAN MEMBERS A THAT'S A LOT OF NEW BATTERIES. A LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ARE SAID TO HAVE A LIFESPAN OF A BETWEEN TEN AND TWENTY YEARS WELL THAT SOUNDS GOOD IT'S A LOT THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO KNOW THAT THE HOLES THE REST THE STORY. SURE BATTERIES CAN LAST LONG IF IT'S A FULLY CHARGED IT REMAINS IDLE. HOWEVER E. D. BATTERIES ARE COULD HILLY CHARGED IN DEPLETED EVERY TIME. YOU DRIVE ONE. IF YOU USE THE LIGHTS RADIO WINCHELL Y. PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE. IT TAKES EVEN MORE A LIFE AWAY FROM THE BATTERY THERE ARE MORE THE MORE YOU CHARGING DEPLETE THEM THE SHORTER THE LIFESPAN BECOMES. A MORE REGIONAL AVERAGES ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS. REGARDLESS OF THE LIFESPAN WE STILL NEED TO TO HAVE A PLAN OF DISPOSAL THESE BATTERIES SO WE DON'T END UP WITH AN ENVIRONMENTAL NIGHTMARE. AT LIKE WE'VE HEARD IN THE. PAST COUPLE BILLS WITH THE EXITE SITUATION. EVEN KNOW EXCITED WITH A MANUFACTURING PLANT. IT'S STILL A A GROSS EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN AND I WANTED JUST TO TAKE pREMEMBER. WHEN THE STATE PASSED THE MTB  <u><c.green>WHICH WAS TO HELP.</c></u> A CLEANER AIR WHILE CONTAMINATE OUR GROUND WHAT THE SAME TIME. AND THIS IS THIS BILL IS ALONG THE SAME LINES OF WHY WE HAVE. MINING RECLAMATION NATURAL USED UP SULFIDES THAT DUMPED INTO RIVERS BECAUSE WE DO NOT MINDING. SMART LAWS IN CALIFORNIA SO UP MEMBERS I JUST SIMPLY ASKING FOR A PLANT AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL TASK THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXICS SUBSTANCE CONTROL CAL RECYCLED AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND OTHERS TO IDENTIFY APPROACHES FOR THE REUSE AND RECYCLE OF ELECTRIC LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY. IT FURTHER REQUIRES DGSE TO DEVELOP A GRANT PROGRAM TO AID THESE PROGRAM PROGRAMS AND CAL RECYCLE DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR CONSUMERS TO PROBABLY DISPOSE OF THESE BATTERIES. I LIKE TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING I GRABBED IN THE HALLWAY. HOW? WHICH IS. WHAT WE DO FOR RECYCLING REGULAR BATTERIES THAT WE USE EVERY DAY AND FLASHLIGHTS CELLPHONES IN THE LIKES? AND IT WILL BE HARD TO PUT A. ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN THAT TO CONTAINER AND BY THE WAY WE DON'T HAVE. A PLAN AND IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING WE KNOW THAT TO WE CAN BE MOVING. UP FORWARD WITH THE BATTERY STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA A IT QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF FOLKS THINK WE CAN OFFSET THE GRID WITH THE TIME USE OF BATTERY SO. THIS IS A PROCESS TO START AFTER GOING OUT TO A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH ALL THESE BATTERIES. AND WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL. THE LIKELIHOOD IS OF SOMETHING HAPPENING CONTAMINATE OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I WOULD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD NOT ANYONE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELL I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AS MUCH AS I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD IN FOR BRINGING THE VISUAL AIDS I LOVE THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN.

AND IT'S MAKES SENSE TO ME TO TREAT THEM THE SAME WAY AS WE TREAT THOSE TYPES OF BATTERIES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S AND WHAT KIND OF LEADING THE CHARGE OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE WITH ELECTRIC. VEHICLES OUT THERE AND THEN WHAT WHAT HAD TO DO IT THEMSELVES NO WE DON'T WANT OTHER EXCITED I SITUATION CERTAINLY SO AM I PLEDGE EFFORTS THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE BELL AND WITH THAT I WILL MOVE THE BILL.

SOME BILLS JUST MAKE YOU FEEL VERY GOOD AND YOU KNOW I COME FROM AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE THESE HUGE WATER DISTRICTS. THEY CAN PAY THEIR FOLKS. ARM THIS IS THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AN EXTREMIST AND. I THINK THAT HELPING. PEOPLE IN THESE DISTRICTS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE HERE SO THANK YOU FOR BILL BRINGING THIS FORWARD AYE URGENT AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY YOU CAN CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY SIXTY EDUARDO GARCIA. DO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. I ARAMBULA. BRO. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE. BUT IT'S A CHEAP. THEREFORE. FORTY HAVE FOR CONGRATULATIONS WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON. ALRIGHT. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE HAVE ANY OTHER AUTHORS CHAU WELL NOW OAK WELL LET'S JUST FINISH THE JOB. THE OTHER ANY OTHER BILLS THAT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE FOR VOTES. YEAH ALRIGHT TO ALL OUR BILLS. EXCEPT FOR A MISTER FARMS ARE OUT SO FAR AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PEOPLE TO VOTE ON THEM. THEREFORE IT IS TIME FOR OUR KIDS ARE AROUND. ARE A PINCH HITTER. MISS FRIEDMAN TO GO FORWARD. YEAH. DID YOU HAVE A REASON THING THAT WE DID YOU WANT TO GO THERE. WELL IT'S FINE OKAY. THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK IN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR HAS STAFF FOR ALL THEIR HELP WITH THIS BILL. MEMBERS YOU ALL HAVE A COPY OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REFERRED. OR REFERENCE IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS BEFORE YOU EVER HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS AT THIS TIME. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY EIGHT SIX TO CREATE A PATH FOR INDIVIDUALS TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY ARE INJURED BY WATER CONTAMINATION THAT IS CAUSED BY A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO BRING A CLAIM WITHIN TEN YEARS OF DISCOVERING THAT SUCH WATER CONTAMINATION BECAUSE THEIR INJURY. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON THAT IS HARMED AS A RESULT OF THE CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CANNOT PROCLAIM AND LESS THEY DO SO WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION. AS AN EXAMPLE OF A STRUCTURE BUILT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BEGINS LEACHING TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO THE GROUNDWATER EVER NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ANYONE HARMED BY THAT CONTAMINATION WOULD BE UNABLE TO BRING A PERSONAL INJURY CLAIM BECAUSE THE CONTAMINATION OCCURRED TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE STRUCTURE WAS COMPLETED. THIS TEN YEAR TIMEFRAME IS UNWORKABLE AN ARBITRARY GIVEN THE UNIQUE NATURE OF WATER CONTAMINATION IT CAN TAKE YEARS IF NOT DECADES FOR SOME CONTAMINANTS TO REACH AND CONTAMINATE THE GROUND WATER SUPPLY. THE LATENT NATURE OF WATER CONTAMINATION SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A COVER TO EXCLUDE EX EVADE LIABILITY CALIFORNIA'S TO CREATE A RICH A ROUTE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND. INJURED BY WATER CONTAMINATION TO RECOVER FOR SUCH HARMS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD A WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON BECAUSE JONES THE CIRCLE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX FORTY EIGHT TODAY. THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE TO ADDRESSED AT CLEANING UP OF CONTAMINATED WATER AND THERE ARE LAWS TO DRESS UP PERSONAL AYE THAT PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS BUT AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THERE IS A GAP IN THOSE LAWS. UP REGARDING THIS AND WORKABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. UNDER AB TWENTY SIX FORTY EIGHT IMAGE WILL COMPARING A PERSONAL INJURY CLAIM. AFTER DISCOVERY THE CONTAMINATION BROTHER THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT A THAT CREATED THE WATER CONTAMINATION AYE THIS WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET THEIR DAY IN COURT AND OUT BE COMPENSATED FOR THE HARMS IT OCCURRED TO THEM. ATWATER INTIMATIONS NECESSARILY A LATENT OUR PROBLEM. WE DON'T DISCOVER IT RIGHT AWAY AND IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO HARM PEOPLE I ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE JUST DRINKING. OVER TIME. SO DO THIS BILL WILL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS GIVE PEOPLE A DAY IN COURT I'M AND I DID ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE BIGGER FOCUS ON GROUNDWATER OUT WAS THIS IMMIGRANT WATER MANAGEMENT ACT PASSED AND WE'RE GONNA BE. TRYING TO RELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING A LOT MORE THESE CONTAMINATION ISSUES. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AS THESE ISSUES ARE OR DISCOVER WITH MORE FREQUENCY OUT WE ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO RECOVER FOR A THE HARMS AGAINST THEM OUT WE URGE AYE VOTES DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LOW THE SENTRY VENTURA WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A LETTER IN ON TIME FOR THIS COMMITTEE HEARING BUT WE DO SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR. THANKS VERY MUCH. BECAUSE THEN WE ARE IF THERE'S NO WARRANT SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR FROM OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. A HALF FOUR MINUTES HAVE PROBABLY TO EACH UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIVIDE IT UP DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS AARON CARRERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT BEHIND THE SPELL AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE BUT. AND AS OF NOW WITH THE BILL IN PRINT OUR LEADERSHIP IS DETERMINED THAT THIS BILL IS A HOUSING KILLER WE HAVE. GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS BILL WOULD PLAY OUT. IN REALITY IN WHICH WE WORK STRUGGLING TO REALLY IDENTIFY EXACTLY THE DEFICIENCY IN CURRENT LAW. TO PREVENT PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS TO PROCEED BASED ON WHAT WATER CONTAMINATION WE'D YOU KNOW. IN NO WAY IS MEANT TO SAY THAT WE DON'T THINK WATER CONTAMINATION IS A PROBLEM. BUT THERE'S CURRENT A CODE SECTION THREE FORTY POINT EIGHT OF THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. WHICH ALLOWS. A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE CUP WATER CONTAMINATION THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT. ON DISCOVERING THAT YOU HAVE AN ILLNESS OR AN INJURY. THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT. TO DISCOVER THAT BECAUSE OF THAT AND THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT ON DETERMINING WHO'S TO BLAME. AND THEN THERE'S A TWO YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AFTER THAT POINT. A FILED THE LAWSUIT SO WE WE FEEL THAT THERE IS EXISTING LAW SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO COVER THESE CLAIMS. A WE DO INTEND TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE BUT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IT. AS BEING VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE HOUSING INDUSTRY DURING A THE HOUSING CRISIS AT WORK CURRENTLY FACING. MY NAME IS JERRY HERMAN I REPRESENT THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF ENGINEERING COMPANIES. INSERTION OF THE WORD PERSONAL IS HELPFUL BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY CASES NOW. SO IT'S MERELY A I THINK CODIFYING PERHAPS THE MARTINEZ CASE. WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE EXPRESSION WATER CONTAMINATION. IS THAT IT ANY LEVEL. AND IT COULD INCLUDE NATURAL CONTAMINANTS. DOES THIS IN ANY MANNER DISPOSE. OR REDUCE THE CAUSATION. I DON'T THINK IT DOES BUT IT RAISES A HOST OF ISSUES THE EXPRESSION WATER CONTAMINATION. MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE. SUBSTANCES THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF AS HAZARDOUS. PUT TOXIC IT'S JUST CONTAMINATION SO I THINK THE BILL NEEDS CONSIDERABLE REFINEMENT AND THEN LASTLY AS ALWAYS IS THE CASE. WITH THESE TYPES OF STATUTES I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE ARE NOT REVIVING ANY. BECAUSE OF ACTION THAT HAS OTHERWISE EXPIRED. I DON'T THINK WE ARE BUT I NEED TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT. TO REFLECT ON THAT. SO ON ON THAT BASIS IN THE ABSENCE OF CONSIDERABLE REFINEMENT WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. UP PLEASE STAY ARM AT THE YET WE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS. OF SO. THERE BE NO OTHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION. OUT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT UP LET ME CONFIRM WITH STEVE CONFER WITH STAFF FOR A MINUTE AND THEN I'LL ASK YOU TO CLOSE ALRIGHT I'M YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I JUST WANNA TOOK VERY QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED FIRST I APPRECIATE. I THE OPPOSITION FOR WORKING WITH US AND COMING HERE WERE VERY COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BILL WOULD OF FACTS ARMED RESIDENCES. I I CAN'T THINK OF TIMES WHEN A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT CAUSES WATER CONTAMINATION FROM A RESIDENTS. USUALLY THESE COME FROM THINGS LIKE STORAGE TANKS THAT ARE HOLDING TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT KIND OF THING. SO. I THINK THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO EXAMS RESIDENCES PERHAPS OR TO JUST CLARIFY WHAT TYPE OF CONTAMINATION WERE TALKING ABOUT AYE I JUST IT'S. I I WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF CONTAMINATION IS POSSIBLE FROM THE HOUSE AS OPPOSED TO PROMINENT AUSTRAL. YOU KNOW FACILITY YOUR LANDFILL THAT SORT OF THING. SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS WHAT IS THAT WHAT TYPE OF CONTAMINATION WE CAN CERTAINLY NARROW THAT DEFINITION AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NON AMBIGUOUS. THERE ARE SOME CURRENT. CASE LAW WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN VERY AMBIGUOUS IN THE LAW HAS STRUGGLED AND THEY'VE ALSO. DEALT WITH THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD CONTAMINATION THERE'S ONE CASE THAT INVOLVES A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT DISCOVERED THAT A LANDFILL BECAUSE OF OTHER CONSTRUCTION DEFECT TITLE. REACHED ONTO THEIR PROPERTY HAD USE VERY UNUSUAL FIND REALLY CREATIVE WAYSOF GETTING RELIEF BECAUSE THE LAW WAS SO ONE. SO I'M THAT'S WHAT WE SEEK TO DO IS TO REALLY CLARIFY THE LAW TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DO HAVE A COURSE OF ACTION IF THEY'VE BEEN HARMED. BECAUSE OF A CONSTRUCTION DEFECT AND BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WATER CONTAMINATION THAT'S WHAT THE STATUTE NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED SOMETIMES IS CONTAMINATION AND IT TAKES A NUMBER OF YEARS TO ACTUALLY FIND OUT WHERE THE CONTAMINATIONS EMANATED FROM. SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THE OPPONENTS UNTIL THEIR SUPPORTERS AND. ASK FOR YOU TO ALLOW US TO A CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS VEY IMPORTANT TOPIC ALRIGHT YOU. I DIDN'T THINK WE HAD A MOTION YET. ALRIGHT THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. TO THE OPPOSITION ARE AYE CLEARLY HEAR A DESIRE TO WORK WITH YOU ARE YOU CAN ALSO WORK WITH MY STAFF ON THE QUESTIONS OF DEFINITION. OF. WE'LL JUST MAKE SURE I MISTER URBAN THAT THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF AND FOR THE BUILDERS ARE CLEARLY SHE WANTS TO WORK WITH YOU. AND. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP WE WELL SO HOPEFULLY AS SHE AS SHE HAS SAID YOU CAN BE SUPPORTERS IN THE AT. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE'VE CLOSED AND I DOUBT YOUR I ASK ANYONE FOR QUESTIONS CASE I HAVEN'T. I ASK OKAY. THEN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM SEVEN. AB TWENTY SIX FORTY EIGHT FRIEDMAN. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED AND REEF REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. QUIRK. I QUIRK. MELENDEZ. MOVEMENT IS NOT VOTE ARAMBULA. BRO. FRIEDMAN. HOLDEN. WHEN I TO CHANGE. CURRENT ORBIT WAS OUT. THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THIS IS. AT. WE HAVE AN AUTHOR. VERY GOOD. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE WHICH BUT WE START WITH. I START WITH THE LOWEST NUMBER. WOULD BE TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO. JULIA. OKAY THIS IS THE ANTI COAGULANT VALUE THIS. MEG. BOB PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS REGULATIONS ENACTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION TO MINIMIZE. HARM FROM ONE SUBSET OF RODENTICIDE STE SECOND GENERATION ANY ANTICOAGULANT RATHER THAN SITES. HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE AS NECROPSY DATA. PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OTHER SCIENTISTS HAS DEMONSTRATED. THAT UNNECESSARY POISONINGS CONTINUE TO POSE A RAMPANT THREAT TO WILDLIFE AND PASS. THE USE OF RODENTICIDE BY LICENSE PEST CONTROL APPLICATORS STILL ALLOWS RODENTS TO CONSUMER DENNIS SITES AND THEN POISON UPPER LEVEL PREDATORS WHICH WILL RESULT IN CONTINUE DEATHS OF WILDLIFE AND PETS MONTHS WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING. IRONICALLY THIS UNINTENTIONAL POISONING DECREASES CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO CONTROL RODENT INFESTATION. BECAUSE IT KILLS THE NATURAL PREDATORS THAT FEED ON RATS MICE AND OTHER RODENTS AND DECREASES NATURAL RODENT CONTROL STRATEGIES. RODENTICIDE ALSO POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO WILDLIFE. EPA'S ECOLOGICAL INCIDENT REPORT DOCUMENTS ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE RESIDUES IN TWENTY SEVEN AVIAN SPECIES AND SEVENTEEN MAMMALIAN SPECIES. POISONINGS AND DEATH IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN NUMEROUS SPECIES SUCH AS EAGLES HAWKS FALCONS. AL'S BOBCATS MOUNTAIN LIONS AND EVEN THE IMPERILED SAN WORKING IN KIT FOX AND NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL. PROBLEM IS SO SEVERE THAT OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF WILDLIFE TESTED IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO RODENTICIDE IT'S. RODENTS SIZE POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO CHILDREN. ACCORDING TO SAFETY CALCULATIONS FROM THE EPA THE ESTIMATED CHILD EXPOSURE FROM TAKING JUST ONE. FIVE GRAMS BITE OF RODENTICIDE BAY GREATLY EXCEEDS POSSIBLE SAFE LEVELS. RODENTICIDE POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO PAT'S AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS AS WELL. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PETS NEEDLESSLY DIE EACH YEAR DO RODENTICIDE EXPOSURE. SINCE THE CONSUMER BAD OF TWENTY FOURTEEN DFW AND WHILE CARE THROUGH A GRANT FROM DPR HAVE CONTINUED TO MONITOR SUSPECTED POISONING CASES. IN THEORY THE USE OF A SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT SHOULD HAVE DROPPED THE NUMBER OF CASES BUT IN REALITY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS CONTINUED. POISONING OF NON TARGET WILDLIFE FROM SECOND GENERATION WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN NONE AN INCREASE FROM FIRST GENERATION OF ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE OF NON TARGET WILDLIFE. MOST FAMOUSLY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN P. TWENTY TO THE LOCAL LOS ANGELES MOUNTAIN LINE THAT HAS A BEEN FOUND IN GRIFFITH PARK. WAS FOUND WANDERING THE AREA AND LOOKED TO BE SICK WITH MANGE PARK RANGERS CAPTURED P. TWENTY TWO AND TREATED THE COUGAR. AS WELL AS TOOK BLOOD SAMPLES HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR MAINLY FIRST GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS THE COUGAR HAD BEEN CLOSELY MONITORED IN THE AREA BY DFW OFFICIALS. AND UNTIL RECENTLY HAD BEEN HEALTHY. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO SIX TO TAKE STRONGER MEASURES. PROTECT CHILDREN PETS AND WILDLIFE FROM UNINTENTIONAL RODENTICIDE POISONING. THE USE OF RAT MOUSE AND RODENT POISONS BY THE GENERALPUBLIC AND LICENSED APPLICATORS LEADS TO THE DEATH OF WILDLIFE AND PETS. AND THE HOSPITALIZATION IN ILLNESSES OF CHILDREN. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO ALLOWS FOR COMMONSENSE CONTROLS ON THESE DANGEROUS POISONS IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THEIR USE WHERE THEY LEAD TO UNNECESSARY POISONINGS TO NON TARGET ORGANISMS WHILE STILL ALLOWS A ALLOWING. FOR THE USE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY AND TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE BILL IS NARROWLY TARGETED AT FIRST AND SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE STE AND SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES WHICH ALLOWS FOR A DATA SIZE TO STILL BE USED TO ADDRESS RODENT INFESTATIONS. AFFECTING AGRICULTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND IN CASES WHERE PROFESSIONAL PETS COMPANIES HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONTROL THE RODENT POPULATION THROUGH EXCLUSION AND SANITATION. AND HAVE RECEIVED A PERMIT TO USE ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDE FROM DPR. NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND MORE HUMANE MEANS OF CONTROLLING RODENT POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY USED BY PEST MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. OFFERING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THE USE OF PESTICIDES ACCEPTED HIGHLY. PACIFIC CONTEXT IS NEITHER JUSTIFIABLE NOR IS IT SUPPORTED BY THE PUBLIC. A FURTHER RESTRICTIONS CALLED FOR IN AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO WILL NOT ONLY OFFER PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT. IT WILL FURTHER STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF ALTERNATIVE ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE CONTROLS GIVEN THE OVERWHELMING HARM THAT IS POSED BY ROTE TENNIS RODENTICIDE. AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES THESE POISONS MUST BE BETTER REGULATED TO PROTECT CHILDREN PETS AND WILDLIFE. I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES JANET PROPOSER AND. TO VAUGHN FRASER FROM UCLA. VERY GOOD TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. CLICK. CHAIRMAN AND THIS. OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF PROJECT COYOTE AND RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION IS A PART OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO. AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OUT OF CONCERN FOR THEIR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THE DPR TOOK A NUMBER OF ANTICOAGULANTS OFF CONSUMER SHOUTS. BUT WITHOUT A SIMILARLY RESTRICTIVE RIVER THAT SIMILARLY RESTRICTING THE USE BY THE PEST CONTROL INDUSTRY. AS A CONSEQUENCE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS HAVE CONTINUED THE ROUTINE USE OF ANTI COAGULANT THAT'S AND NOT SURPRISINGLY NOT TARGET EXPOSURES AND DEATHS HAVE NOT DIMINISHED. IF THAT THEIR INCREASING AT AN ALARMING PACE. AT FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT AND NOW ALLIANCE AT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DOCUMENTED ANTICOAGULANTS. IN THE LIVER TISSUE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE OF THE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN. CLIENTS TESTED THAT'S NINETY FIVE PERCENT. IN ANOTHER STUDY UP BY YOU SEE DAVID SCIENTISTS OVER A FOUND OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE ENDANGERED. NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL HAD BEEN AND HAD LIKELY BEEN EXPOSED HER AGAIN TO SITES. ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FROM A CONSERVATION STANDPOINT. ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF RODENTICIDE EXPOSURE IN RARE AND THREATENED SPECIES INCLUDING THE FISHER. A LARGE MEMBER OF THE WEASEL FAMILY THAT LIVES IN THE REDWOOD FORESTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IMPALED SAN JOAQUIN FOX. IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANY SPECIES A PREDATOR THAT HAS NOT BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY REAGAN BESIDES. THE DELETERIOUS IMPACTS OF THESE DANGERS COMPOUNDS NOT RESTRICTED TO WILDLIFE EVERY YEAR MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED WITH POOR CHILDREN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. THE CALASANZ CANCER ACCIDENTLY POISONED EVERY YEAR IS WELL. KNOWN QUESTIONS THE NEED FOR READING CONTROL ONLY THAT MEANS IN TERMS BY WHICH YOU CAN BE MOST RESPONSIBLY ACCOMPLISHED SANITATION SEARING BUILDINGS MOVING FOOD WATER AND HABITAT. ARE THE KEY TO EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL READING CONTROL METHODS AS IS A LOVELY NATURAL PREDATORS HAWKS OWLS BOBCATS FOXES COYOTES COULD YOU WANTED YOU THEIR OWN JOB TO DO THE ANY SHIPS OF THE OTHERS. AND HAVE HER TELL HEADACHES AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT EVERY CENT AND. VENTURA COUNTY WATERSHED PROTECTION DISTRICT PILOT STUDY SWAPPED BAY BOXES FOR POISON AND THEY FOUND THAT NOT ONLY DID UMBER WITH BUDGETS REDUCED THEY. ESTIMATED ANNUAL SAVINGS OF SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER. AYE LEVY MILE AS EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALSO USING. ARE NOT HAVE DISCONTINUED USING ANTICOAGULANTS ARE USING SNAPCHAT'S AND OTHER METHODS TO CONTROL RATS INCLUDE DE INSECURE INEQUALITY PEPPER NINE UNIVERSITY UC DAVIS THE CITY OF DAVIS AND TO ADD. THAT MARIN COUNTY JAPANESE PESTICIDES OF TWO THOUSAND NINE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU BOB. I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES OKAY. UP FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWO FOUR TWO TWO. MY NAME IS DIVINE FRAZIER AND I AM HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A LARGE AND GROWING COMMUNITY OF SCIENTISTS CONCERNED SCIENTISTS THAT ARE AWARE. OF. THE DANGERS THAT THESE ANTI QUIT OR DON'T SITES POSE TO WILDLIFE AS WELL AS TO HUMANS AND PETS. I RECEIVED MY DOCTORATE FROM UCLA IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. DURING WHICH TIME I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF THESE TALKS CAN SOME BBCATS AND OTHER WILDLIFE. A RESEARCH TEAM IS VERY DIVERSE INCLUDES MEMBERS OF THE UCLA MEDICAL TEAM I'M SORRY MEDICAL SCHOOL DISEASE ECOLOGIST WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE BEEN MONITORING WILDLIFE IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. WE HAVE. PUBLISHED A WEALTH OF PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT CHARACTERIZE EVALUATE THE SYSTEMIC SUB LETHAL. AND SECONDARY EFFECTS OF THESE POISONS ON NON TARGET SPECIES WE DOCUMENTED DEATHS OF THREE MOUNTAIN LIONS. DO DIRECTLY TO EMERGING COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO RODENTICIDE SO. THE LATEST BEING IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH IS MORE THAN YEAR FOLLOWING THE ON PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO LEGISLATION THAT WAS RESTRICTIVE BUT NOT COMPLETELY PRECLUDE SERVE FOR THE USE OF THESE WRITTEN DECIDES. A MORE RECENTLY LAST SEPTEMBER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND A MALE LION WAS LOCATED DEAD. AND WHILE THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH COULDN'T BE DETERMINED TO TO. SEVERAL DAYS SINCE THE DEATH OCCURRED. HE DID HAD POSITIVE TEST POSITIVE FOR. IT'S DIFFERENT. FIRST AND SECOND GENERATION WRITTEN DECIDES. WE CONTINUE TO FIND RACCOONS COYOTES GRAY FOXES THAT ARE TESTING POSITIVE BILLION DYING DIRECTLY DUE TO HOW MERGING. I WE'VE ALSO FOUND OVER SEVERAL YEARS A VERY STRONG CORRELATION IN BOBCATS AMOUNT ALLIANCE WITH. A DISEASE OF MANGE DISEASE. WHICH HAS NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN DOCUMENTED BECAUSE POPULATION LEVEL AFFECTS BUT IN THE BOBCATS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA HAS CAUSED PRECIPITOUS DECLINES IN POPULATION NUMBERS. OUR MOST RECENT RESEARCH LOOKING AT THE CELLULAR AND GENE EXPRESSION EFFECTS NOT TO JOURNEY SORRY I APOLOGIZE. BUT WE'VE OBSERVED ON CELLULAR. FX BUT CELLULAR LEVEL AND THE LEVEL OF GENE EXPRESSION. THAT THESE RODENTICIDE HAVE SEVERE SYSTEMIC IMPACTS ON IMMUNE FUNCTION AND BOBCATS WITH. LOVE I SURE AM WITHOUT. SO TO SAY THAT THE EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE FUNCTION CAN HAVE CASCADING A FAX IN THE FACE OF INTRODUCED IN DISEASES AND BECAUSE POPULATION LEVEL AFFECTS. IN A VARIETY OF SPECIES I'M WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THESE METHODS OF CONTROL AREN'T ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER METHODS THAT CAN BE DEVISED. AND IN FACT WE ARGUE THAT THEY'RE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE GIVEN THAT RODENTS HAVE SHORT GENERATION TIMES CAN DEVELOP RESISTANCE. ANTS. IF YOU AFFECT THE PREDATORS THAT ARE CONTROLLING THESE THINGS NATURALLY YEAR CLEARLY GONNA HAVE A OKAY LESS EFFECT. OTHER ISN'T IT PLEASE. STAY. OTHERS IN SUPPORT AT THAT WILL HAVE QUESTIONS OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUSIN OF AS AN AVID BIRDER IN A CALIFORNIAN. HERE IN SUPPORT. AS A GUY ALLEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING ABOUT A THOUSAND CANNABIS CARS DIDN'T GET OUR SUPPORT TO THE COMMITTEE ON TIME BUT WE NEED TO TAKE A POSITION ONCE COMMUNICATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SOSA MATTER NOT WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. CURRENT. ARM IFYOU TWO COULD MOVE TO THESE TWO CHAIRS. AND THEN WE COULD HAVE THE OPPOSITION COME UP. IT WOULD GO AND TAKE THE OTHER TWO CHAIRS AND THEN. IF YOU ALL LOVE WHEN THIS FINISHES COULD STAY HERE FOR QUESTIONS I THINK WE'LL HAVE A INTERESTING DISCUSSION. ALRIGHT. WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST TWO MINUTES EACH AND I'LL GO TO TWO AND A HALF IF YOU'RE REALLY? REALLY HAVE TO SINCE I DID WITH THE OTHER FOLKS GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M JUST SLIGHTLY TERRIFIED SO I HOPE YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME AYE IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THIS BEFORE IT'S A BIG DEAL I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I TESTIFIED. I WAS REALLY NERVOUS. NOT MY FIRST TIME BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME EVERY TIME IN MY NAME IS JIM STATE AND I'M I'M THE OWNER OF A PEST CONTROL COMPANY HERE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA. AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE PRESIDENT ELECT A PEST CONTROL OPERATORS OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION OF PEST CONTROL OPERATORS THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE INDUSTRY. IN CALIFORNIA AND WE. ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT STRUCTURE BUT FULL SUPPORT OF ITS INTENT. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED EFFECTS OF. READINESS SIDES ON CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE. AND I'M WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A. THE BILL THAT I THINK WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN SUPPORTING IT WITHOUT PUTTING PUBLIC HEALTH AT RISK. CURRENTLY AS THE BILL IS WRITTEN. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE IF YOU NEED TO USE RIGHT THAT THE SITES. FIRST OF ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO THIS DEEMED THAT THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. SECONDLY. A COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER NEEDS TO SEND SOMEBODY TO DETERMINE THAT RODENTICIDE. ARE A ALLOWABLE PART OF THE RESPONSE TO THAT EMERGENCY. SO YOU HAVE NOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL A RODENT SITUATION WHETHER BE IN A RESTAURANT HOME OR SCHOOL. I YOUR HANDS TIED DOUBLE BACK BEHIND YOU WITH RED TAPE. IN WITH. AT A WITHOUT ANY CRITERIA FOR MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS. A LET ALONE AND THAT IS THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW REQUIRES A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DO THAT. AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS VARY GREATLY DEPENDING UPON. THE AREA. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE STAFF. TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE'VE ALREADY DID HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER'S AND THEY KNOW THAT BASED ON THE HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF REQUESTS THEY MAY GET PER WEEK THEY WOULD HAVE A GREAT DIFFICULTY IN RESPONDING IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO IT'S A OUR SUGGESTION THAT AND. AS POINTED OUT AT PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS FROM YOUR STAFF THEY ASKED THE QUESTION. WITH THIS BILL NOT BE BETTER WITH THIS CONTENT BE BETTER ADDRESSED. THROUGH REGULATION AND WE STIPULATE THAT IT WOULD BE. IN FACT THAT THAT THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT DP ARE. THE DEPARTMENT PESTICIDE REGULATION BE CHARGED WITH COMPILING AND SOME PROTOCOLS FOR THE USE. AND. RODENTICIDE. UNLESS THE OTHER WITNESS DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK ILL HAFTA ACCOUNT ALMOST OUT MOST THEIR SET BY THE WAY YOU BRING UP VERY GOOD POINTS AND WE ARE LISTENING GREAT. AND WE JUST FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING TOGETHER ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WILL GIVE US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT PUTTING PUBLIC HEALTH AT RISK. WHICH WERE EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNED ABOUT. VERY GOOD. NEXT WITNESS I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTE. THANK YOU MY NAME IS A DARREN VANCE TEAM LIKE I WORK WITH A CLOCK PRESS CONTROL I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS CALIFORNIA. FOR. THAT FROM A PEST MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE THIS BILL IS A AND GONNA FULLY AGREE WITH JIM I'M WHILE WHILE VERY WELL INTENTIONED AND. IT MAKES. IT BASICALLY TOTALLY MISSES THE MARK ON AYE ON ON IMPLEMENTATION OF IT BUT ONE OF THE POINTS I WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER WAS THAT. THAT NATURAL A PREDATOR'S KEEP OUR CURRENT RODENTS A IN A POPULATION AND CHECK ON THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE. THE GUY THE THREE PRIMARY ROADS THAT WE DEAL WITH THEM ARE ALL INVASIVE SPECIES AND A AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE A CARING CAPACITY WITHIN OUR WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT. THEIR AT WHILE THERE IS SOME WILDLIFE AND THAT MAY BE ABLE TO. TO. TO USE THEM AS AS A FOOD SOURCE AYE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TOO AGAIN I KEEP THOSE POPULATIONS ARE COMPLETELY IN CHECK TO WEAR A. TIE TO WHERE THEY ARE NOT A PROBLEM. IN IRVINE AND OR OR WILD AREAS. A. I. RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THE CITY SAN FRANCISCO HAS HAD SOME. KIND OF A ED IS A UNIQUE AND OR OR CAN A SIMILAR A. THAT PROGRAM. AS TO WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING FOR. BUT IT IS A AYE AYE THAT THAT IS A COMPLETELY UNIQUE A A PROGRAM TO THAT LOCALITY AND FOR MULTIPLE REASONS A ONE. THE. THAT THE FINANCIAL UNSUPPORTED THAT THAT THAT HAS AND THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS THEIR. THE CITY SERVICES GO A VERY READILY ADMITS THAT THEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO ACTUALLY I'D DO IT I'M SO SO. TO PERFORM ALL THOSE INSPECTIONS SO THEY ACTUALLY A CHARGE ALL OF THE. THAT THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC A OWNERS OF THOSE BUILDINGS I'M FOR ALL OF THOSE IT FOR ALL OF THOSE INSPECTIONS WHICH AGAIN CONTINUES TO ADD A COST TO PEST MANAGEMENT SERVICES. ON AND IT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP EARLIER A MIND THAT THE NEXT POINT IS THAT. THAT THIS BILL. A UNFAIRLY TARGETS A SEGMENT OF POPULATION I CAN'T AFFORD OUR SERVICES AND AND HAVE TO BEFORE THE SERVICES THEMSELVES AND THEIR IS. HAD THERE IS A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF OUR OF OUR SOCIETY THAT. THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE NOR THE EXPERTISE NOR THE RESOURCES I EITHER. MONEY OR MATERIALS TO PERFORM THE A A THE TRAPPING OR THE EXCLUSION OR THE SANITATION. THAT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM. TO DO NOW IN THE IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION HOW WOULD. IT WHAT WOULD THEY DO. WOULD HOMEOWNER THAN HAVE TO GO TO A PUBLIC AT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AND GET AN EXEMPTION OR TO USE. AND I QUITE AGREE GENOCIDE I'M THIS THIS BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT AT ALL. AND AGAIN. THIS BILL WE FEEL IS BEST. IT WOULD BEST BE ADDRESSED. IN THE REGULATORY AROUND. THROUGH A REGULATORY AGENCY THAT THAT REGULATES AS AS THEY ASSEMBLYMAN SAID. THEIR SALES USE AND A. BY THE SALES AND USE OF OF THE YEAR OF THE PRODUCTS IN WHICH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU SIR THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS ASSOCIATION LIKE TO MAKE ONE COMMENT. AND IT WAS A PART OF THAT THE TOP VERY QUICK QUICKLY. JUST IN LISTENING TO THE OTHER THE PRESENTATION OF THE BILL AND AND. THAT CONCERNS RAISED BY THE PCO SEE. THE AG COMMISSIONERS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERCEIVED ROLE GIVEN TO THEM WITHIN THIS BILL THE PRESCRIPTIVE DIAGNOSTIC WORK THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO. A FALLS FAR OUTSIDE OF THEIR NORMAL COURSE OF DUTIES. NOW WE JUST WOULD HELP THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL TODAY MIGHT CLARIFY. WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO DO AND SORT OF WHAT THE ROLE IN THE PROCESS IS FOR THE AYE COMMISSIONERS I'M VERY GLAD I GAVE YOU THAT TIME BECAUSE THAT IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT TO AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I THANK YOU ABOUT JOB THAT WE? ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION REAL QUICK NOTE FAMILY BROWN EYES THAT I ALSO MENTION HIS CLIENTS RISE AND WESTERN CLINT OPPOSITIONAL SOAP. YOU CARE MEMBERS JIM JUST ABOUT THE AMERICAN CANCER COUNCIL ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. HELLO YOU NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. JOINT YOUR MAP THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONAL SOAP. SYLVIA CAN MERE BOARD CERTIFIED ENTOMOLOGIST AND A DISTRIBUTOR HERE TARGET SPECIALTY PRODUCTS OPPOSED. I GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BUT YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT SIMILAR TO OUR COLLEAGUES BUT THAT COMMISSIONERS WE. HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE IN THIS PROCESS AND. JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU BOTH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONERS FOR BRINGING YOUR CONCERNS FORWARD AT THIS TIME. SO. I'VE THERE NO MORE SUPPORTERS ARE OPPOSITION I'LL GO TO QUESTIONS FROM THE. I MEMBERS GO AHEAD MISTREATMENT. A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT Y. JUROR ONE QUESTION WHICH IS WILL HAD ME AS A CO AUTHOR TO THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR. IT MIGHT COME IN IS IT A FEW WEEKS AGO I WAS ABLE TO GO TO A PRESENTATION BY THE COUNTY OF VENTURA. ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON TESTING. COMPARING THE ANTI COAGULANT AMBER DENNIS SIDES AGAINST OTHER METHODS AND THEY'VE BEEN TESTING THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEY'VE BEEN TESTING IT IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS AND HAVING TO DO WITH. SHORING UP LEVEES THAT ARE BEING DAMAGED BY BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF RODENTS. AND WHAT THEY FOUND OUT WAS THAT IN THOSE AREAS THE. PER THEY WERE PUTTING PURCHASE UP TO ATTRACT ARM HAWKS AND OWLS AT THE HAWKS AND OWLS OUTPERFORM THE RODENTICIDE. ABOUT OVER MOST OF A ONE TO TWO HUNDRED PERCENT. AND THEY DID REALLY COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEY IN THE. I HAD A VERY WELL DESIGNED. A STUDY METHODOLOGY IN THE THAT THEY THEY THAT WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE AND BY THE WAY THE OWLS BEAT THE HAWKS ALMOST TWO TO ONE SO. IF YOUR WANTING TO ATTRACT SOMETHING I'M THERE THEY'D BE A GOOD ONE AND WHAT THEY FOUND FOR THE ACT FOLKS ALMOND. YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW THIS BUT BECAUSE THE CRITTERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO EAT THE CROPS AND THE BABY WAS REALLY DOING NOTHING. WHEREAS THE HAWKS IN THE OWLS ARE OUT WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY DOING NOTHING BUT RODENT CONTROL. A I THINK IT'S REALLY UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WERE ALLOWING OUR WILDLIFE BE POISONED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS AND CATS TO BE POISONED IN THIS INCREDIBLY INHUMANE. WAY IT'S GOING ON FOR YEARS AND WE THROW OUR WHOLE SYSTEMATIC BALANCED WHERE NOW WE DON'T EVEN HAVE. THE PREDATORS TO KEEP THIS POPULATION IN CHECK WHICH ADDS TO THE THE PROBLEM. I'M VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A LONG TIME IN COMING. I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP YOU GET THIS THROUGH AND I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT THE DISTRICT IN WHICH P. TWENTY TWO LIVES. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN LOS ANGELES THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE FOR THAT BIG CAT. AND WHEN THE PHOTOS OF HIM BEING POISONED WERE SHOWN ALL OVER THE MEDIA PEOPLE WERE OUTRAGED. SO I'M RESIDENTS. ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS I HEAR ABOUT THIS ISSUE CONSTANTLY FROM PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT SO THIS IS A OF LOCAL CONCERN FOR ME AND I THINK IT IS FOR. A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING ATTENTION AND LOVE THE ANIMALS THAT THEY LIVE ALONGSIDE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. VERY GOOD. ANYONE ELSE SKINNER SUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IDEA. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE. DESIRE TO PROTECT. ANIMALS AND AND AND PATS. HOWEVER AYE GOING. OUT HAVE A HARD TIME IMAGINING. YOU KNOW HOW HAWKS AND OWLS CAN YOU BE USED ESPECIALLY IN URBAN SITUATIONS TO. WE KEEP OUR OUR RODENT POPULATIONS AND IN CHECK AND SO YEAH I. WANTED TO. YEAH I I HEARD YOU TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES TO THE. ANTI COAGULANT. RODENTICIDE SO WHAT WHAT ARE THE MOST. COMMON AND. ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES ROUGHLY FLAT APPLYING. FINE THEN THE ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF SANITATION AND THAT REMOVING HABITATION SUCH AS EDUCATION. WHERE RATS CAN BREED? THAT SANITATION METHODS TAKE IT KEEPING DANCERS CLOSED UP. BEYOND SNAPCHAT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE AND THEY HAVE TO BE CHECKED MORE OFTEN UP BECAUSE ABOUT TO SET A WANDERING OFF TO DIRE. DAD THERE I HAVE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE TRAPS OF MORE MAN HOURS. ARE INVOLVED GENERALLY BE DE AND IRAQ THERE ALSO ELECTRIC CAT RATHER CATERS IS WHAT THEY'RE CALLED WHERE THE HECK RAT ENTERS AND IS GONE HE REALLY LIKES QUICKLY DONE. ELECTROCUTED. AND I I JUST I KNOW THAT DAD THAT IN THE INSTANCES WHERE AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE AT. AT COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES HAVE MOVED FROM THE USING PAPER POISON TO USING THE SNAP TRAFFIC SPREAD PRIMARY DEFENSE. THERE I IN MY INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO OF YOU SAYS THAT PATSY NO COMPLAINTS OF ANYTHING THEY FOUND THEY HAD BETTER READING CONTROL. WHICH IS WHY A CITY OR A COUNTY LIKE MARIN COUNTY WHICH IS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE NOT USED ANY POISON ON HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL EVEN THOUGH THEY INVADE MANAGED A FACILITY SUCH AS THAT UNIT THAT FRANKLY RIGHT. COMMUNITY CENTER WHICH HAS A LOT OF THEM. EVENTS AND FOOD ORIENTED AND OCCASIONS THERE THERE STILL I'M FINDING THAT WITH THE AND THE COMBINATION OF THE AYE SANITATION AND. I HABITATION AND THAT STEPPED OUT SO THEY HAVE BEEN VERY AND HAVE NOT HAD A PROBLEM HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE REQUEST COME FORWARD IN TEN YEARS ALMOST FOUR AND EIGHT TO USE PESTICIDES. OKAY. ARMED. SO IT'S PRIMARILY THAT THE THE FACT THAT TRAPS NOT TRAPPED IN OUR AND ENVIRONMENTAL. MITIGATION OKAY AND AN EGRESS KIT PREVENTING RATS FROM ENTERING. SITES WE DON'T WANT A A SCREENING PGA. AYE ENTRIES TO A TO HOMES. BY FILLING HOLES. OF THE CAN ALLOW INGRESS THAN AN EGRESS. ARE THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR UP FOR RODENT CONTROL ALWAYS REMOVING VEGETATION AWAY FROM. THE. SO IT'S NOT UP AGAINST A HOUSE OF THICK VINES THAT GROW NEARBY ARE FREQUENTLY. A BREEDING GROUNDS FOR RODENTS THESE ARE UNPROVEN A AND VERY EFFECTIVE METHODS. I THOUGHT WE HAD A MENTION OF THE. A LECTURE GOTTA A RADICULAR LIKE VIEWS DATA THOSE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AT AT MY HOME THEY'VE PROVEN VERY EFFECTIVE BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THEM AND. IS HAVE BEEN REFERENCED IN THE DISCUSSION HERE IS THAT THEY HAVE. ACTUALLY GONE THROUGH SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF IMPROVEMENTS UP TO THAT EQUIPMENT AND. THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE AS WE MOVE DOWN THE PATH OF IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. IS. A A A A MORE INNOVATION AND DATA USING PROVEN STRATEGIES THAT DID NOT INVOLVE USING POISON. I CAN YOU KNOW MISTER BLOOM AYE I'M A. PRODUCT OF THE SEVENTIES AND MAYBE I WATCHED TOO MANY OF THOSE MOVIES OF OF RATS THE. TAKEN OVER AND COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS READING THE. ANALYSIS OF THE THE THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE. RODENTS WITH THE BONNET PLAGUE. BEEN DEAD DO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME PROVISION ABOUT. A PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPTIONS GOOD. THERE ARE AND AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE HAVE TO BE. A CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT TO SEPARATING FACT FROM FICTION. OF ME WHEN I HER A OF BOTH THAT REPRESENTING HOLLYWOOD UP AND I THINK YOU HOPE. WERE PRETTY GOOD STEP OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT. THE. IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER HERE IS I THINK WHAT THE GOAL IS AND THAT IS REDUCING ACCESS IN THE USE OF ACCESS TO IN THE USE. OF FOR OF POISONS I'M NOT SURE IF I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT LOVE THE. PEST CONTROL OPERATORS. RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THE VAGUENESS OF. PETITIONING FOR EXCEPTIONS IN THE CASE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS. NECESSITIES YES. AND THAT PROVIDES ME WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT OF COURSE WE WILL. CONTINUE DISCUSSING GO WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT PROVISIONS IN THE IN THE BILL I THINK THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE WE CAN. HOPEFULLY FIND SOME LANGUAGE THAT TOOK A OF THAT WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH AND IMPROVE THE BILL. WE ACTUALLY. CONTROL OPERATORS WHO HAVE TRIED TO SIT DOWN WITH US WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE TIME TO DO THAT THAT IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. I FREQUENTLY POINT OUT WHEN THE. OPPONENTS TO BILLS HAVEN'T MADE AN ATTEMPT TO MEET WITH US THIS IS ACTUALLY AN A A A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MEET WITH US AND WE JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. COORDINATE TO THIS POINT SO. COMMITTEE. CONTINUIDAD WHO DIG COMMIT TO HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT. BEFORE YOU CLOSE ARM. I THOUGHT I HAD A QUESTION BUT I THINK ACTUALLY YOU ASKED IT SO WELL I KNOW WHAT IT WAS I JUST TO MENTION THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN AN EXEMPTION TO AGRICULTURE. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HERE IS PRIMARILY WHAT AREAS. WHERE WHERE YOU PARTICULARLY CONCERNED URBAN AREAS SUBURBAN AREAS SO I I I THINK A? OF THIS IS OF INTENSE INTEREST IN. OF FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. AND. A AREAS THAT ARE LARGELY SUBURBAN. AT SOME SOME WHAT RURAL. VETERAN OF THE. AT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE COMFORTABLE ALLOWING FOR AN EXEMPTION FOR AGRICULTURE IS THAT THEY'RE ALSO OF. A PROFESSIONALS IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH PAST ISSUES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME THERE ALSO GROWING FOOD UNDERSTAND THE NEED O KEEP FOOD SEPARATE FROM. POISONS. AND REDUCING THE USE JUST A STATE OF OUR REDUCING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON FERTILIZERS UP AND MOVING TOWARDS IN MANY CASES NATURAL ALTERNATIVES THIS IS REALLY A CONTINUATION. OF THAT SAME REFOCUS. OKAY THANK YOU. AND THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SO ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM I ACTUALLY SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE USED. OF THESE TYPES OF A CHEMICALS I GUESS IF YOU'LL ARE PAID FOR THESE RODENTS BECAUSE. IT'S. IT'S DEADLY FRANKLY F. IF A CHILD GETS A HOLD OF IT OR. THE NEIGHBORHOOD DOG OR CAT MEAN I GET IT I DO UNDERSTAND I DON'T HAVE ANY IN MY HOME AND OUR HOME BACKS. TO A VAST CANYON WE HAVE LOTS OF CRITTERS BACK THERE AND THEY'RE ALWAYS RUN INTO MY BACKYARD. BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF OF BAIT IN MY HOME MY THERE WE HAVE. SOME. LITTLE GLUE TRAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT IT IS A PROBLEM FOR FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WERE. YOU KNOW IN THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU'RE HOME BACK JUST THAT SORT OF THING AND WHEN WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH OUR PEST CONTROL COMPANY. THE THE COST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. USING THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF GETTING RID OF WRITERS AND AS OPPOSED TO THE NEWER METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVICE LIKE THE TRAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO. AFFORD THAT. I AND I HAVE SOME CONCERNS OF THAT JUST MIGHT NOT BE FEASIBLE IN SOME SITUATIONS I'M NOT NECESSARILY IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA BUT IN SOME OTHER COMMERCIAL AREAS WHERE. IT JUST WON'T WORK I THINK MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY THEY WANT THE QUICKEST AND CHEAPEST WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND IF THAT'S. IS SOME OF THE WAYS THAT YOU SUGGESTED THEY'LL THEY'LL DO THAT BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND AND I I HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT THE ROLE THAT WILL BE CHANGING NOW IN IN YOU KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DECIDE WHEN THESE. TYPES OF. RODENTICIDE CAN BE USED IN WHEN THEY CAN'T IS I THINK CONCERNING FOR IT FOR GOOD REASON I'M SURE YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT TOO IN IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. ESTO I. FOR THOSE REASONS. THOUGH I'M WITH YOU IN CONCEPT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT SAY THAT PERHAPS AS YOU GO IF YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THERE MAY BE SOME CHANGES AND I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I AM I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU I HOPE TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT AND TOOK I WOULD JUST TO ADD AND I THINK YOU ACTUALLY TOUCHED ON THIS BUT YOU SAID. QUICKEST AND CHEAPEST A BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT SIXTY. INITIALLY IN YOUR REMARKS AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR QUICK AND EXPENSIVE. BUT SAFE. ALL RIGHT. UP ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU COULD GIVE ME ONE MINUTE. I'M OF THE BILL ALRIGHT. MANY NEW BY MISS FRIEDMAN SECOND BY MISTER MURATSUCHI. SO THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE I HEARD FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GUIDELINES AND AYE I KNOW THE AUTHOR WILL WORK WITH THEM ON THAT THAT'S. AND. YES YOU SEE AND HE HAS AGREED ARE SO AND HE IS GOING TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN MOVE AHEAD. US SOMETHING ELSE WAS RAISED IN THE. ANALYSIS WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF. IF YOU REGULATE. THE ANTICOAGULANTS THEN THERE OTHER POISONS OUT THERE. AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT YOU DO WITH THOSE AS WELL AND WORK WITH THE? PEST CONTROL AGENT. WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT YOU MAKE IT DIFFICULT USE ONE SUBSTANCE? AND THEN IT BECOMES. PEOPLE FIND SUBSTITUTES. SO I I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO THINK ABOUT VERY CAREFULLY ISABEL MOVES FORWARD NOW I KNOW YOU WELL. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS. JUST. INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT NOW. OUR VICE CHAIR AND I UNDERSTAND WHY SHE HAS HER CONCERNS. I WILL SAY OR CAN YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST. PEST CONTROL AREAS I KNOW ABOUT. THEIR IT THEIR APPROACH ENTIRELY IS SEAL UP THE HOUSE FIRST. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T DO THAT. POISONS TRAPS NOTHING WORKS. THEN WHEN YOU SEAL UP THE HOUSE. IT'S JUST AS EASY FRANKLY AND PROBABLY AS CHEAP TO USE TRAPS AS TO USE POISON. AND. IT ONE THING FOR SURE WITH TRAPS AS YOU'D LEAST YOU KNOW WHERE THE ANIMAL IS AND IT DOESN'T END UP ON YOUR WALL SOMEWHERE. SO AGAIN WITH I THINK THE. IN OTHER MANY LARGE INSTITUTIONS NOW AND AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT ARE GOING THIS WAY HOLE COUNTIES AS. WELL MISS FRIEDMAN SUGGESTED SO I DO THINK THAT THIS IS FEASIBLE I DO THINK THERE'S MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I'M HOPE. AND WITH THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE A JOB I KNOW THAT. WHETHER IT'S STRAPS OR POISON OR SOMETHING ELSE. ROADS WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US. SO. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE THANK YOU FOR THE PAST CONTROL OPERATORS FOR WORKING THANK YOU FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES FOR ASKING FOR WHAT YOU NEEDED IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE. I THINK WE'RE WELL ON OUR WAY TO GETTING A VERY GOOD BILL HERE THANKS TO ALL THE WITNESSES ALL OF THE SPEAKERS. AND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND SO WE CAN ASKED TO CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FIVE. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWO BLOOM THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REAR FOR TO THE COMMITTEE ON WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. MELINDA SNOW AROUND THE LAND. WROTE. FRIEDMAN I FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN. WHAT I TO DO? BUT IT'S WHAT SHE. THREE TWO ONE YEAH IT IS THREE TO ONE AND WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FROM OUR MEMBERS BUT YOUR BILL IS ON CALL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH AGAIN TO EVERYONE WHO WAS HERE TODAY THANK YOU ALL. BUT AGAIN I PERSONALLY. TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT. ALRIGHT SO THE NEXT BELL IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. BLOOM A JUVENILE PRODUCTS FLAME RETARDANT MATERIALS AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT. WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT'S ALWAYS CHECK INTERFERE THAT. YOUR BILL IS A FAVORITE OF THE CHAIR. HOPEFULLY THAT THAT MEANS THAT A OF A FAVOR TO SUPPORT AS OPPOSED TO. DOT SUPPORT OF AB AND WE'LL FIND OUT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT OF THE SEVERE PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BY PROHIBITING THE SALE OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS JUVENILE PRODUCTS. MATTRESSES AND UPHOLSTERED OR RE UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE THAT CONTAIN FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPOSED TO TOXIC FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. WHICH ARE IN SOAP IS THE SOAP AS WE SIT ON THE MATTRESSES WE SLEEP ON. AND IN THE TOYS THAT OUR CHILDREN PLAY WITH. OVER TIME THE ACCUMULATED OUR BODIES AND IN THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSING A VARIETY OF ADVERSE HEALTH AFFECTS INCLUDING AND THE CRANE AND THYROID DISRUPTION. CANCER AND HARMFUL NEUROLOGICAL FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH FLAME RETARDANTS ARE DANGEROUS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THEY POSE A PARTICULARLY HIGH THREAT TO SPECIFIC POPULATIONS INCLUDING CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS. INFANTS ARE OFTEN OFTEN EXPOSED% TO FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS THROUGH CONTAMINATED DUST AND BREAST MILK AND HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE THESE CHEMICALS IN THEIR BODIES AT LEVELS. THREE TO FIVE TIMES THE LEVELS IN THEIR MOTHERS. FIREFIGHTERS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS. AND THEIR DERIVATIVES AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS BURN THEY RELEASE CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES KNOWN AS DIOXINS AND FURANS. THESE CHEMICALS ARE INHALED BY FIREFIGHTERS AND EVEN LINGER ON PROTECTING A PROTECTIVE CLOTHING LONG AFTER A FIREFIGHTER LEAVES THE SITE OF A FIRE. AS A RESULT WE'RE SEEING HIGHER RATES OF CANCER MONTHS FIREFIGHTERS THAN EVER BEFORE. IN ADDITION TO BEING TOXIC THESE CHEMICALS ARE ALSO A NECESSARY TO MEET FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS LET ME REPEAT THAT THESE CHEMICALS ARE. UNNECESSARY TO MEET FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS. AND THIS IS WHY MANY MANUFACTURERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE VOLUNTARILY PHASE IN ABOUT. HOWEVER STRAGGLERS CONTINUE TO REMAIN AND WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT UP WE CANNOT. OF BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC WITHOUT A RESTRICTION ON THE SALE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS. CONTAINING THESE CHEMICALS AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT PRIORITIZE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS BY FACING THESE CHEMICALS OUT FOR GOOD. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE OF A CAR WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. ALVARO CASANOVA ON BEHALF OF THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. AND EMILY LOW AYE CAPTAIN THE CITY OF DAVIS FIRE DEPARTMENT. ALL RIGHT ARM I CAN GIVE YOU A MINUTE HAVE FEATURES THAT WORK OKAY AND I'LL DO THAT FINE. ALRIGHT. YOU HAVE MEANT HALF. CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS EMILY LOW AND A CAPTAIN WITH CITY DAVIS FIRE DEPARTMENT I AM ALSO THE MOTHER OF TWO SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT FOCUSES ON ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN CONCERNED IN THE FIREFIGHTING PROFESSION FOR DECADES THE CANCER RISK BASED BY THE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA AT ANYWHERE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY NAMES TO THE CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS MEMORIAL IN THE CAPITAL PARK. MANY OF THEM ARE VICTIMS OF JOB RELATED CANCER CAUSED BY PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO THE CARCINOGENS ON THE JOB. AS MANY AS ONE IN THREE FIREFIGHTERS IS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER AND STRONG DATA LINKS FIREFIGHTERS ON THE JOB EXPOSURE TO FLAME RETARDANTS. TO ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. BIO MONITORING STUDIES SHOW THAT THE BODIES OF FIREFIGHTERS CARRY GREATER LOADS OF THESE FLAME RETARDANTS WHEN COMPARED TO AVERAGE POPULATION. FOR EXAMPLE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FIREFIGHTERS IN ONE STUDY TESTED POSITIVE FOR FLAME RETARDANT SUCH AS PBDES AND THE BY PRODUCTS PRODUCED WHEN FLAME RETARDANTS BURN. FIREFIGHTERS CARRIED THESE CHEMICALS IN CONCENTRATION TWO TO THREE TIMES GREATER THAN THE LOW CARRIED BY THE U. S. POPULATION. WE BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TOXINS CONTAINED ITHIN THIS CHEMICAL FLAME RETARDANTS AND THOSE COMPOUNDS RELEASED WHEN THEY BURN CONTRIBUTE TO A HIGH RATE OF CERTAIN CANCERS AMONG FIREFIGHTERS. EVERY TIME A FIREFIGHTER'S ENTERS A STRUCTURE FIRE THEY ARE CONFRONTED WITH HAZEN TOXINS IN COMPOUNDS RELEASED BY SMOLDERING FINER FURNITURE. EASE GASES SEEPS INTO OUR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING SOMETIMES PENETRATING THE BREATHING APPARATUS FIREFIGHTERS ALSO INHALED THEM DIRECTLY DURING THE OVERHAUL AND MOP UP OPERATIONS WHEN THEY ARE WEARING THE BREATHING APPARATUS. EVEN FIREFIGHTERS BACK IN THE STATION ARE EXPOSED BECAUSE A TOXIN STAY IN THE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. NOT ONLY ARE THESE TALKS AS DIRECT THREAT TO THE STATE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS THEY POSE A SERIOUS THREAT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY TO THOSE. WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT ESPECIALLY THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION OUR CHILDREN. ALL THESE CHEMICALS DO IS CREATE A HEALTH RISK FOR THE CONSUMERS WHEN THEY DON'T BURN AS SERIOUS TOXIC EXPOSURE RISK WHEN THEY DO. THEY DON'T PREVENT FIRES THEY REALLY ONLY DO ONE THING AND THAT IS TO MAKE MONEY FOR THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTION PROVIDED BY THESE TOXIC RETARDANT IS MINIMAL FIRES BURN HOTTER THAN THEY USED TO. AND THE MATERIALS USED TO MAKE FURNITURE CAN RENDER THESE RETARDANTS ALMOST USELESS. I BECAME A FIREFIGHTER KNOWING THE DANGERS INVOLVED BUT NONE OF US KNEW THAT WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT HAS NO REAL PURPOSE. AS A FIREFIGHTER A MOTHER AND THE CONSUMER I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED LEGISLATION AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME. THANK YOU. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A MCCARTNEY IT'S AN ASTM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ABDULLAH BUT I SUSPECT SOME OF THEM I AM THE POLICY MANAGER AT THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. I'M HERE TO URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT TO PROTECT CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES FROM TOXIC FROM RETURNING CHEMICALS IT'S OF NO EFFECTIVE PURPOSE AND FURNITURE CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS AND MATTRESSES. FOR OVER TEN YEARS A CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN WORKING TO ROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE PROVEN HEALTH THREATS OF TOXIC FROM RETARDANT CHEMICALS. INDEED PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES AND MANY FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS INCLUDING THOSE ADOPTED A SAFER REPLACEMENTS ARE TOXIC TO PEOPLE. OFF TO OFTEN WE DISCOVER THAT THE REPLACEMENT FOR MATERNA CHEMICALS CAUSE MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS SUCH AS REPRODUCTIVE HARM TO BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. DECEPTION TO THE BODY'S HORMONE SYSTEM DECREASED IQ IN CHILDREN. CANCER AND IMMUNE DISORDERS. MANY OF THESE CHEMICALS. FOR EXAMPLE EXEC A O'DONNELL HOW JAY FROM RETARDANTS ARE ADDED TO PRODUCTS MIGRATE INTO THE DUST. AND LEAD TO CHRONIC IN HOME EXPOSURE TO CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. I MUST ALSO KNOW. EXPOSURE THESE TOXIC FROM TURNING CHEMICALS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. FINALLY STUDIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND UNITED CLEAN UP KINGDOM CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THREE ESSENTIAL FACT FAX ONE. AS USING FURNITURE JONES PRODUCTS MARIN IF YOU COULD JUST SOME ARE I WILL. THESE THESE CHEMICALS DO NOT PROVIDE ANY FIRE SAFETY. ARE NOT NEEDED TO MEET THE ABILITY STANDARDS AND PUT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS THAT AT RISK THANK YOU. ALRIGHT MINUTE NAP. JEFFERSON QUIRK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK MY NAME IS OUT OF THE CAR I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE TWO NINE NINE EIGHT. AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CASANOVA MENTIONED. PLIMMERTON CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH MARRIED ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS AND CALIFORNIANS ARE ROUTINELY EXPOSED TO THESE CHEMICALS TO PRODUCTS IN THEIR HOMES. UNFORTUNATELY THIS EXPOSURE PERSISTS EVEN WHEN THESE CHEMICALS DO NOT SEVER USEFUL PURPOSE. IN THE PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA'S BUREAU OF HOME FURNISHINGS AND THERMAL INSULATION HAS PREVIOUSLY FOUND A FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. DO NOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL FIRE SAFETY BENEFIT AND FURNITURE. THE BUREAU REVISED IT'S TIME ABILITY STANDARD TO PROVIDE FIRE SAFETY WITHOUT FLAME RETARDANTS. THE BUREAU HAS ALSO EXEMPTED JUVENILE PRODUCTS COVERED BY THE BILL FROM FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS DO NOT POSE A SIGNIFICANT FIRE SAFETY RISK. THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION FEDERALLY ALL WHICH SETS FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS FOR MATTRESSES HAS STATED THAT FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT NEEDED TO MEET THAT STANDARD. TESTING INDICATES THAT THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCTS IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES ARE ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED WITHOUT FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICALS. UNFORTUNATELY A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY OF LAGGARDS IN THESE PRODUCT CATEGORIES CONTINUES TO EXPOSE CALIFORNIANS DO THESE DANGEROUS CHEMICALS. THAT'S WHAT AB TWO NINE NINE EIGHT AIMS TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S WHY IT IS NEEDED. WE ASK FOR A AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALRIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THIS FILM VERY PROUD TO BE IN SUPPORT AND ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THEY GIVE. DANIEL SO YOU KNOW ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL YOUR BEHALF OF SITTING COUNTIES HARRIS'S GOT SUPPORT. ALEX ONLY SOME BEHALF OF THE VOICE FOR CHOICE ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT. AND DRIVEN HER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS STATED AND BECAUSE THESE CHEMICALS WERE BECOMING EMERGING CONTAMINANTS IN OUR WATER. MOURNING GARB ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. FILL OUT LEO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT. LISA VAN FLEET BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT. JUST RUN WITH A SEVENTH GENERATION ADVISES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARM WERE NOW GOING TO BRING UP THE OPPOSITION IF TWO OF YOU CAN STAY UP HERE AND TAKE THE TWO CHAIRS CLOSER TO ME WHICHEVER TO PREFER THAT. I PREFER TO STAY AND THEN WE'D BRING UP AND LET TWO CHAIRS FOR THE OPPOSITION. VERY GOOD. ALRIGHT PLEASE JACK COME UP LISA STARK TESTIMONY GREAT THANK YOU SIR. MY NAME IS JAY WESTON I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE PERHAPS GET A LITTLE CLOSER AND MICROPHONES. THE LAKE HERE TO CONTEND. YOU CAN MOVE THE MICROPHONE TOWARDS YOU THAT'LL MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER. I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE NORTH AMERICAN FLAME RETARDANT LIGHTS OF THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN WE OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. SOME FIRST AS A POLICY MATTER WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD AND AND IT'S HARD ANTI INNOVATION. THE DEFINITION OF FLAME RETARDANT CHEMICAL IN THIS BILL WOULD NOT ONLY TO RESTRICT THE USE OF FLAME RETARDANTS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET. BUT IT WOULD RESTRICT THE USE OF ANY FRAME WHICH HARDEN IN THE FUTURE. THE BILL WOULD RESTRICT SUBSTANCES THAT HAVE YET TO BE CONTEMPLATED REGARDLESS OF THEIR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. THEIR HAZARD PROPERTIES ANY EXPOSURE POTENTIAL. YOU COULD DESIGN THE GREENEST MOST SUSTAINABLE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FLAME RETARDANT SUBSTANCE IMAGINABLE AND THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT AND NEVER SAW THE LIGHT OF DAY. WE BELIEVE THAT MANUFACTURERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST MODERN APPROPRIATE FLAME RETARDANT TECHNOLOGIES IS PART OF THEIR OVERALL FIRE SAFETY TOOL BOX IN THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT IMPOSSIBLE. SECONDLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS TO ANALYZE THE USE OF SUBSTANCES IN THEIR PRODUCTS AGAINST POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES. THE PROCESS HAS TO INCLUDE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT WHICH MAKES THEM HAVE TO CONSIDER TRADE OFFS SUCH AS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AIR AND WATER QUALITY IMPACTS PRODUCT FUNCTION PERFORMANCE WASTED END OF LIFE DISPOSAL. ALONG WITH HAZARD AND EXPOSURE. UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM ARE UNDER THAT DTS YOU PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO APPROVE IMPOSE A VARIETY OF RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES RANGING FROM PROHIBITIONS TO LABELING AND NUMEROUS OTHER OPTIONS THAT THEY SHOULD CAN DENY SO SORRY. YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT DTS HE IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING FLAME RETARDANTS UNDER THEIR PROGRAM. IN JULY OF LAST YEAR THEY BEGIN A PROCESS TO EXAMINE THE USE OF TO FLAME RETARDANTS IN CHILDREN'S PADDED SLEEPING PRODUCTS. AND IN THEIR RECENT DRAFT TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY WORK PLAN BELA SEVERAL PRODUCTS CATEGORIES AND CHEMICALS THAT THEY MAY BE THAT MIGHT BE USED IN THOSE CATEGORIES SORRY. AND FLAME RETARDANTS ARE AMONG THOSE CHEMICALS SO FLAME RETARDANT SOME PRODUCTS ARE SQUARELY IN DTS SEES FOCUS. AND THEN FINALLY MY LAST POINT. THIS BILL IS ALSO UNNECESSARY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S FURNITURE LABORING LAW GIVES CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT REQUIRES LABELING ON RESIDENTIAL FURNITURE TO INFORM CONSUMERS OF WHETHER THEIR PURCHASES INCLUDE FLAME RETARDANTS ARE NOT. BOB COMPANIES CAN BE FINED FOR NOT PRODUCED PROVIDING THE CORRECT INFORMATION AND NOT KEEPING THE CORRECT RECORDS WHEN INSPECTORS COME AROUND. SO JUST IN SUMMARY ON THIS POINT THE FURNITURE LABELING LAWLESS STREETS WHY THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATORS ART ESTABLISHED A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF FLAME RETARDANTS AND MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY AND WE URGE YOU TO. HAVE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR NEXT. A GERMAN COURT MEMBERS THE CANADIAN MY NAME IS ANDY HAPPENED HERE ON BEHALF OF THE JUVENILE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURES AND. ECHO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER BUT. OUR INDUSTRY HAS MOVED AWAY FROM FLAME RETARDANTS WHETHER NOT TECHNICALLY NECESSARY WE'VE WORKED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON TV ONE SEVENTEEN TO HAVE JUVENILE PARKS EXEMPTED EMBOSS WERE PRETTY TSC TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION AND AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE. UNDERSTAND IN AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS LEGISLATION AS REGARDS TO STATEWIDE UNIFORMITY HAS MENTIONED WORKED WITH. DGSE AND. WITH. THE STATE ON TV ONE SEVENTEEN. YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT SAN FRANCISCO HAS MOVED FOR WITH AN ORDINANCE IN THIS AREA AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS BILL HAS EXEMPTED SPECIFICALLY CAR SEATS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN FLAME RESISTANT STANDARDS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL LEVEL UNDER NHTSA. AND ALSO EXEMPTED ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS TO HAVE TO MEET UL STANDARDS GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE FLAME RETARDANTS TO MEET US PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. THIS BILL EXEMPTS THOSE THOSE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE STATE WHAT UNIFORMITY ON THAT ASPECT SPECIFICALLY SAN FRANCISCO DOES NOT ADDRESS ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS WHICH HAD BEEN BEEN ADDRESSED IT PERFECTLY WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IS TAKEN. SO WE'D ENCOURAGE OUR TO BE SOME APPRECIATE THE TIME TODAY AND KANSEN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARM AND YOU. BOTH TOOK JUST FOR OUR FOUR MINUTES AND FIFTEEN SECONDS CONGRATULATIONS YOU WERE FIFTEEN SECONDS DATA. A SHORT AT LAW SHORT YEAH IT'S GREAT. A. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MELISSA HONOR ON BEHALF OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. PAT RILEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. JOHN KEPT YOU BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONAL SOAP. GOOD AFTERNOON TOM SHE HE HERE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS THE. NATIONAL YOU COULD TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO I LIKE HOW YOU COULD TAKE TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR CONCERN UP BE VERY BRIEF OF THANK YOU. WE DO REPRESENT THE MATTRESS MANUFACTURES THE UNITED STATES. I'M THIS BILL HAS CURRENTLY CONSTRUED THE DEFINITION OF FLAME RETARDANT SO BROAD. A MY MANUFACTURES A TELLING ME THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SELL MATTRESSES INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE BILL'S CURRENTLY AMEND. HIS WERE GONNA HAVE TO WORK ON THE DEFINITION. OTHERS PROBABLY NOT TIME RIGHT NOW TO GO INTO DETAIL Y. DID HAVE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE OF THESE ISSUES ARE ON THE TABLE. BOMB I WILL TELL YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT OUR INDUSTRY STOP USING BROMINATED FIRE RETARDANTS AND OTHER CHEMICAL FIREBIRD FIRE RETARDANTS IN THE FOAM MATTRESSES WERE THE MAIN ENERGY SOURCES. WE STOP USING THOSE YEARS AGO UP AND THE TO THE STRATEGIES THAT WE USED OUT TO KEEP THE PHONE FROM IGNITING. DON'T INVOLVE THE TYPES OF TOP TOXIC MATERIALS THAT WE BELIEVE THE AUTHOR IS ZEROING IN ON THIS BILL. SO IN SUMMARY WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THE DEFINITION OF FLAME RETARDANT SO BROAD WE WILL BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCT IN THE ST LOUIS IT'S REFINED. AND WE DON'T USE THE TYPE OF CHEMICALS TO STOP FIRES FROM IGNITING OUR MATTRESSES THAT THE AUTHOR IS TARGETING IN THIS BILL. AND OUT WE WOULD OF RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. ALRIGHT THOUGHT QUESTIONS. MISTER MURSHID TREAT YOU QUESTION. YES YOU ALWAYS GO AND MY MIND. SO. IT WAS ONE OF HERE EL. INDEED THE POINT MADE ABOUT HER. BANNING ANY. ATTENTIONAL FEATURE. ARE. MAYOR MAY NOT BE A TOXIC OR HARMFUL. TWO FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHER AND AND JUVENILES. I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK IS WHETHER THERE IS ANY RETARDANT THAT'S NECESSARY IN ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. AND THE UNDERSTANDING I HAVE IS THAT THERE IS NO NECESSITY. ON IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAFT LANGUAGE OF ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SOME FUTURE PRODUCT. AND AS SOON AS WE OPENED THAT DOOR. YOU COULD BE INVITING. OF OUR ANY CHEMICAL CHANGE. THE ARE TO BECOME A NEW PRODUCT RIGHTS IF YOU CHANGE THE FORMULATION OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING USED IN LIMITED. OF A PRODUCT'S TODAY BUT IF YOU WERE TO MAKE. A CHEMICAL CHANGE THEN IT BECOMES A NEW. SUBSTANCE. OUT SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DRAFT AROUND THAT I'M WILLING TO TRY AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR IS INTERESTED IN WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT IT. AND I WANT TO KEEP THE DOOR OPEN TO A ARRIVING AT SOME LANGUAGE BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO. A TO FIND A LIE IDEA A A A. AWAY OF A OPENING THE DOOR TO INNOVATION. THAT IS NARROW ENOUGH SAID THAT IT DOESN'T INVITE REFORMULATION THAT WOULD OF WHAT WE KNOW TODAY IT'S TOXIC. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT. OF. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES AND THOSE WHO SUPPORT AND OPPOSE. ARM YOU MAY CLOSE. A OF THERE BUT AND NUMBER OF FOLLOW UP UP POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THAT INVOLVE A. ISSUES OF DRAFTING AND REFINING LANGUAGE A A COMMIT TO CONTINUE A SPEAKING TO OPPOSITION ABOUT. HOPEFULLY FINDING CA LANGUAGE THAT EVERYONE CAN LIVE WITH. A. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE BY RECALLING PCA CAPTAIN LOW'S. REMARKS BECAUSE AS SHE WAS MAKING HER REMARKS AT FTA A AND IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT WE HAVE. TWO GROUPS THAT WERE PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN HERE CHILDREN AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO. A A A TO THESE CHEMICALS UP IN THE CASE OF FIREFIGHTERS. THEY ARE EXPOSED AS CHILDREN. AND AS FIREFIGHTERS SO THEY REALLY EXPERIENCE THIS OF TWICE THAT KIND OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR THEM. OF THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE WE KNOW THAT RESPONSIBLE MANUFACTURERS ARE NO LONGER USING THESE CHEMICALS. AND IT IS TIME TO END THE USE ENTIRELY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ASK FOR YOUR OF THE. OKAY. ARM A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL FOR THE MATTRESS FOLKS. OF WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT IT IS THAT THEY'RE SPANNING A CHEMICAL. THAT'S IN THE DATA SHEET AND I DON'T THINK THAT WHAT YOU DO WITH MASTERS HIS WILL EVER BE IN THAT AS A CHEMICAL IN THE DATA SHEET BUT. A WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE OF THAT BUT THIS. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT THEIR BANNING ARE CHEMICALS THAT SHOW UP AS FLAVORING TARGETS IN THE DATA SHEET I JUST DON'T THINK THAT. THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT WE SHOULD DEBT TAKE A LOOK AT THAT'S MORE AND JUST MAKE SURE. IN REGARD TO. MEETING FEDERAL STANDARDS AND I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT FEDERAL STE FIRST WELL TWO THINGS. YOU'RE WORRIED THAT. CHAIRMANSHIPS GO IS NOT ALLOWING. PEOPLE TO MEET THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRONICS AND. IS THAT CORRECT SO THIS SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE IS NOT ON DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME EXCLUSIONS THAT TO THE BILL THAT'S PENDING HERE HAS.% AS OF ELECTRONIC. I'M THERE GONNA REQUIRE PETITION PROCESS SUMMER UNCERTAIN ON WHERE THAT'S GOING TO TAKE US. FIVE SO IF WE COULD MAKE SEPARATE SISTER RETROACTIVELY CONSISTENT OR WE PROVIDED LANGUAGE TO TRY TO TO GET TO THE ISSUE OF HAVING ONE STATEWIDE STANDARD. WHERE THESE TWO PRODUCT CATEGORIES THAT ARE REQUIRED? VIA THE FEDERAL STANDARDS TO HAVE SOME FLAME RETARDANTS CONTENT QATARIS I KNOW. YOU KNOW ON THE BAG ISSUE AND OTHERS WE'VE HAD THAT'S KIND OF CONCERN. AND AGAIN I I WOULD HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR COULD NOT WORK WITH THAT AND THAT WILL PROBABLY NEED TO TALK WITH PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT I THINK. THE WAY HE HAS DONE HIS BILL IS CORRECT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BRING SAN FRANCISCO ALONG IN THIS. WITH REGARD TO. A FUTURE BREAKTHROUGH. I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO DO IT AND THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE FIREFIGHTERS SAYING. WE NEED SOMETHING THAT IT IF THE MANUFACTURERS HAVE COME UP. WITH SOMETHING THAT DOES THE JOB. THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS THINK IS IMPORTANT. AND THEY COME FORWARD AND SAY WE NEED THIS I THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE WAY TO LOOK AT IT. AND THEN. WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO PROVE THAT IT'S SAFE. AND AGAIN I WOULD ASK THE MANUFACTURES TO PAY FOR THAT PROCESS. I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE WAITED TO DRESS THIS THERE COULD BE OTHERS. ARM AND I JUST ASK THAT YOU KEEP UP THAT OPEN WITH ME AND I KNOW YOU WELL. AND EITHER CONVINCED ME THAT THIS ISN'T A CUT PROCESS HERE THERE'S ANOTHER PROCESS THAT GUTTER THERE IS NO PROCESS. I I'M I'M CERTAINLY VERY OPEN ON THIS SIDE LIKE TO INVOLVE THE MANUFACTURERS AS WELL. I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO. LEAVE THE WAY OPEN BUT NOT IN A WAY THAT POISONS FIREFIGHTERS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT TO FIND. OR OR CHILDREN OR ANYONE ELSE SO THAT'S A LOT TO ASK AND. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO IT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT UP COULD EVER MOTION. BUT WE HAVE A MOTION ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. MADAM SECRETARY CALLED CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB TWENTY NINE NINETY EIGHT BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON PRIVACYAND CONSUMER PROTECTION. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. ARAMBULA. BRO. FRIEDMAN. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I. MURATSUCHI I. MATTEUCCI I KNOW THREE WELL IT UNANIMOUS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS TO GET IT OUT SO I THINK YOU MISTER KIT WILL SEE HOW IT GOES AND DATA. I'M PRETTY SURE WE'LL GET IT OUT IN THE END. ALRIGHT. MISTER HOLDEN. OUR YOU HAVE ITEM FOR AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY YOU MAY NOT FIRE WHEN READY MISTER HOLDEN OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE A THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PERCENT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TODAY. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE STATE WATER. RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO ADOPT REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT CHILD CARE CENTERS DRINKING WATER IS LEAD FREE. THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS ALL LICENSED CHILD DAYCARE FACILITIES TO BORROW NO INTEREST LOANS TO PAY FOR LEAD CLEANUP. AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS. DRINKING WATER AT MOST CHILDCARE CENTERS IS NOT TESTED FOR LEAD. THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY WATER PIPES FAUCETS AND FIXTURES STILL IN USE CONTAIN LEAD. AND OVER TIME THIS LEAD CAN LEACH INTO THE DRINKING WATER. YET WE KNOW YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE MOST HARMED BY LEAD BECAUSE THEY ABSORB MUCH. OF THE LEAD THEY INGEST. ACCORDING TO MAKE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD IN CHILDREN. LEAD IS A SEVERE NEUROTOXIN. EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD IN THE BODIES OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN CAUSE HARM TO THEIR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMS. AND THIS HARM APPEARS TO BE IRREVERSIBLE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY WILL HELP KEEP YOUNG CHAU YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAVED BY ENSURING THEY ARE NOT IN JUSTIN LET THROUGH THE WATER THEY DRINK. I HAVE WITH ME ANDREA VENTURA FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION AND SALUTE SUSAN LITTLE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. OUGHT TO JOIN ME IN PRESENTING THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVALS LOOK THE BILL. SECOND. THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE AND WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AS YOU KNOW EXPOSURE JUST AS TO JUST A TINY AMOUNT OF LEAD CAN REDUCE A CHILD'S IQ AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES. AND YOUNG CHILDREN ABSORB FIFTY PERCENT OF THE LEAD THEY INGEST. IF THERE MARK IF THEY'RE MALNOURISHED THEY ABSORB EVEN FASTER SO IT'S NOT A SURPRISE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATES THAT EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OF LEAD POISONED CHILDREN. COME FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND THESE FAMILIES OFTEN RECEIVE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. BECAUSE CHILDCARE CENTERS DON'T HAVE TO TEST THEIR DRINKING WATER FOR LEAD WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. IF THERE WATER CONTAINS A NEUROTOXIN BUT TESTING THAT HAS BEEN DONE. INDICATES THAT SOME CENTERS HAVE A PROBLEM. RECENTLY THE DRINKING WATER ONE EAST OAKLAND CHILDCARE CENTER WAS SHOWN TO HAVE SEVENTEEN TIMES. THE ALLOWABLE LIMIT OF LEAD. AND A PILOT PROJECT PERFORMED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. INVOLVING ELEVEN CENTERS IN FORT ST IN FOUR STATES. FOUND THAT A THIRD OF THOSE CENTERS HAD DRINKING WATER WITH LEAD LEVELS WELL ABOVE THE EPA STANDARD. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY REQUIRES DSS TO ENFORCE THE EXISTING DRINKING WATER REQUIREMENTS. AND ALLOWS CENTERS AND FACILITIES TO YOU TO USE AND UNDER UTILIZED NO INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM TO PAY FOR LED REMEDIATION. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TIGER HEAD GASKET TWO AND HALF MINUTES SHE WAS FAST. PERFECT THANK YOU. HI I'M ANDREA VENTURA I AM THE TOXICS PROGRAM MANAGER FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION. OF OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT DRINKING WATER. AND WATER RESOURCES AND WE ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL COALITION CALLED THE LET'S SERVICE LINE COLLABORATIVE. WHICH ARE NGOS PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES AND WATER AGENCIES TRYING TO ELIMINATE LEAD FROM OUR WATER OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. AS MS A LITTLE JUST ALLUDED TO IN A WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IT TURNS OUT THAT CHILDREN. UNDER THE AGE OF TWO YOU ARE PRETTY DOT HEARD PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. BECAUSE YOUNGER CHILDREN. APPS ACTUALLY ABSORB MORE LEAD. AND ALL OF THE GROWING BRAINS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE. FORMULA FED INFANTS ARE EVEN A GREATER RISK ARE THEY CONSUME THE MOST WATER PER BODY WEIGHT AND SIXTY PERCENT OF BABIES ARE EXCLUSIVELY FORM FORMULA FED SO THEY'RE CONSUMING UP TO FOUR. OF WATER A DAY. NOW WHAT WE DO HAVE A LEAD AND COPPER RULE IN CALIFORNIA THE PROTECT DRINKING WATER SOURCES. OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IS IT'S THE CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE BUILDINGS THAT ARE CAUSING THE CONTAMINATION IN THE PROBLEM AND EXPOSURES. AND OUR CURRENT REGULATORY PROGRAM CANNOT OVERSEE ALL OF THESE BUILDINGS. ABOUT LAST YEARS SIMPLY BILL SEVEN FORTY SIX AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER BEGAN TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN BY REQUIRING TESTING. OF TAPS AT SCHOOLS BUILT BEFORE TWENTY TEN. THAT TESTING IS HAPPENING AND WE'RE FINDING THAT FIVE PERCENT OF THE TYPES THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED THUS FAR. ARE ABOVE THE OFFICIAL DETECTION LIMIT OF FIVE PARTS PER BILLION. AND. AND AS MANY HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN PARTS PER BILLION SO THE PROBLEM IS VERY REAL WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS OF TESTING TO DATE WARRANT. THE EXPANSION OF THE TESTING REQUIREMENT TO INCLUDE ALL LICENSED DAYCARE CENTERS TO PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR POPULATION. AND WE ARE PROUD TO BE HERE AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL. OKAY NOW THERE'S IN SUPPORT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. TRUTH ANDERSON WITH OUR CAN YOU SEE P. CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT. DANIEL SILVINO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. JIM LINDBERGH ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT. ALRIGHT DO WE HAVE OPPOSITION. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT. ALRIGHT. ARM ON MISTER HOLDEN SPELL WHICH IS. TESTING FOR LAND IN CHILDCARE FACILITIES. MADAM VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE REDO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE NOW SEE? YEAH GIVE ME A MINUTE I DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MISS FRIEDMAN. ALRIGHT WE'LL JUST WAIT TO YOUR READY DON'T DON'T RUSH YOURSELF. WE'VE GOT TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APOLOGIZE FOR I'M HAVING A STEP OUT BRIEFLY SO. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT IN IN THIS CASE. PARENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE. A BLOOD TEST FOR THEIR CHILD. TO THE. CHILD CARE FACILITIES ARE CRACKED. A FIGURES ON MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ASK IF THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN TESTED HER. AND IF THEY'VE BEEN TESTED THEN OBVIOUSLY. PROVIDING. THE RESULTS OF THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE. ACTUALLY REQUIRING. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF THE THERE WOULD BE A QUESTION ASK BECAUSE YOUR CHILD. BEEN TESTED FOR BLOOD POURS. OKAY AND THAT EXPLOSION EXPOSURES. SO IF IT'S. I GUESS IF IT'S NOT REQUIRED THEN. APART BE HARD TO TRACK HER IDENTIFY IF. OR EITHER IF THERE IS A PROBLEM IF THERE ISN'T RIGHT. ITS THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS I THINK. IS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE. WHICH CHILDREN ARE HAVING IN IT ELEVATED LEVEL OF LEAD IN THEIR SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE FROM THEIR WATER SUPPLY IN SO WE WANT THE TESTING TO BE DONE SO WE CAN. RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. AND SO IF THEY'RE NOT. REQUIRED TO DO THE TEST THEN I GUESS IT'S HARDER TO. I GUESS FOR ME I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AND REASON WHY. THE BILL ALSO CALLS OUT THE. LOWERS LOW INTEREST LOAN THAT'S AVAILABLE IS SO THAT THE. THE OPERATORS COULD ALSO BE RESPOND BOSS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR ENSURING THAT THERE'S THAT THAT THEY CAN DO THE REPAIRS IF THERE HAS REPAIRS THAT ARE NECESSARY WHERE THROUGH THE PIPES THE FAUCETS. IF THERE WAS SOME TESTING DONE TO. THE EFFORT STRUCTURE DETERMINED THAT THERE IS LED. IN THE PIPES THAT IT COULD LEADS INTO THE WATER. THEN THERE'S A FINANCIAL. SAFEGUARD WE WILL. TO ALLOW FOR THOSE OF PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO. MAKE THE APPROPRIATE. IMPROVEMENTS. I GUESS I'M I'M. AS A PARENT WHO'S HAD KIDS GO THROUGH NOT DAYCARE BUT PRESCHOOL. WHY ARE WE NOT JUST? SAYING TO THESE FACILITIES YOU MUST HAVE YOUR WATER TESTED. ANNUALLY YEAR BIANNUALLY RATHER THAN. PUT THE BURDEN ON THE PARENTS. TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT. EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY FUNNY. PLEASE DO. SO THE BILL HAS ESSENTIALLY TWO PARTS ONE IS THE PART THAT REQUIRES THE FACILITIES TO TEST HER WALK WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY. IT'S REQUIRED DSS TO FIGURE TO ESTABLISH A TESTING REQUIREMENT FOR WATER IN THAT CHILD CARE FACILITIES. AND THAT'S TO KICK THAT'S TO ENFORCE THE EXISTING. REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE NON CONTAMINATED WATER TO THE CHILDREN. SEPARATE FROM THAT AND STE AND SIMILAR TO WHAT SIX OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AS WELL AS THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. IT REQUIRES THE FOR PROVIDERS JUST TO CHECK IN WITH THE PARENTS AND ASK THEM IF THEY'VE GOTTEN. THERE HAD THEIR CHILD BLOOD LET TESTED MANY OF THESE PARENTS OUR PARENTS RIVERS AND ONE CAL WORKS AND THERE THAT CHILDCARE VOUCHERS SO THEY WOULD BE THEIR CHILDREN IDEALLY. SHOULD BE HAVING THEIR BLOOD LIKE TACITUS AT LEAST UNDER ARM. CURRENT STATUS OF TESTING PRACTICES. SO. WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE AND WHAT THIS AGAIN IS PROPOSING TO DO IS TO? HAVE THE PROVIDERS ESSENTIALLY BE A SORT OF A POINT OF CHECKIN. IT'S NOT THAT THE CHILD CAN STILL BE ENROLLED IN THE FACILITY IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD THEIR BLOOD LEAD TESTED AND WHAT AND. IF THEY IF THEY HAVE. THAT'S FINE IF THEY HAVEN'T THAN ALL THE BUILD REQUIRES THE PROVIDER TO DO. IS TO HAND OVER INFORMATION TO. PARENTS ABOUT BLOOD BLOOD TESTING SO AT THE END BLOOD LEAD AND SHE'S BEEN LED WRISTS. SO WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IS THEY. THE IS THEY COLLECT FROM THE PARENT THEN SOME SORT OF CALM. PROOF PAPER DEMONSTRATING THAT THERE WAS A TEST IF THAT. TAKES PLACE IF THAT HAS HAPPENED ON THIS BILL ITSELF ISN'T REQUIRING THAT RIGHT NOW IS IT REQUIRING THE DOCUMENTATION. JUST SIMPLY THE VERBAL CHECKIN. BUT THERE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE THE DOG REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION AS PART OF IT. YEAH THAT CAME. I MIGHT SAY THAT THE VICE CHAIR WE HAD A VERY LONG HEARING. ON THIS ISSUE SHALL ARE KIDS WHO ARE ON. MEDI CAL A WEEK'S PROGRAM. INFERIOR REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS TEST DONE ON SOME DO AND SOME DON'T AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET OUT. AND AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THEY TYPICALLY LIVE IN OLDER HOMES WHERE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF LEAD CONTAMINATION NEED DURING THE PIPES OF THE PAINTER BUT EVER. BUT THERE ISN'T. GREAT COMPLIANCE NOW AGAIN ON TO THOSE PROGRAMS IF THE TEST IS PAID FOR. SO WE'RE NOT PUTTING A BURDEN ON THE PARENTS IN THIS IS JUST ASKING FOR A CHECK AND. SO ARM. DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AND IF THEY ARE. NOT CAPABLE OF PAIN THAT CHANCES ARE THE KIDS ARE ON THE PROGRAM THAT WILL PAY FOR IT CHAU. A I THINK WHERE I THINK I THINK WE YEAH AND I HOPE THAT RESOLVES THE ISSUE IN YOUR MIND. OKAY SORT OF LARA. I'M LIKE YEAH ANY CONCERN YOU HAVE IS A CONCERN OF MINE. OKAY THANK YOU. PAM I THINK YEAH I JUST. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE ANY CONCERNS. ABOUT. THAT AND WE'RE DEBT. OKAY. NOW I. AGAIN WITH MANY OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH TODAY I I AM IT WITH YOU. AND AND THE AND THE CONCEPT I JUST HAD SOME CONCERNS I'M STILL A LITTLE HESITANT SO MAD AND AND MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WANTS TO. CHINA MANNER DO JERRY CHINAMEN. NOW BOY HERE OUT OF AND WHAT IS YOUR WHAT IS THE CONCERN EXACTLY. WELL I ALSO AND I DIDN'T RATE IT IT'S. HERE IN MY ANALYSIS ARE DIFFERENT AND HAS TO DO WITH. THE STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING SAID IT IS IT THE SAME AS. THE STANDARD FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE AS FAR AS THE PARTS. A THE PBS WOULD THE PARTS PARTS PER BILLION YET PERSON. IS IT THE SAME STANDARD OF TESTING. UP BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT'S NOT BUT MAYBE MISSED THE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WHERE YOU SAID IT IS. IT IS ACTUALLY WHAT IT'S DOING ITS DIFFERENCE. DIFFERENT FROM THE LEAD TESTING IN SCHOOLS REQUIREMENTS WHERE IT WAS ALL LAID OUT IN THE BILL. THIS BILL IS REQUIRING DE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WATER BOARD TO DETERMINE HOW THE TESTING IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE WHICH INCLUDES THE DEFINITION OF WHAT IS LEAD SAFE. SO IT'S NOT FOLLOWING FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR OTHERS LAKE GUIDELINES FOR KEY THROUGH TRIAL AND AND THAT IS WHY. BY IT SPECIFICALLY JUST WE DECIDED IT WAS BETTER PROP BE BECAUSE. THAT ISSUE THE THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS. THIS THIS SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD FOR THE CHILDCARE FACILITIES ISLAM. IT'S SUBJECT TO. THE WATER BOARDS RIGHT DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE SO YOU'RE LEADING EXPERTS DECIDE EXACTLY WE'RE LETTING THE EXPERTS MAKE THAT DECISION AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE IN THERE AND AND. AND THE WATER BOARD IS ACTUALLY. LOOKING AT THE LEAD STANDARD FOR WATER RIGHT NOW AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO LEGISLATE THEN. IN THE BILL NAM. AND THINK IT'S JUST BETTER THAT THE REGULAR TO REGULATORS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SAID IN THIS REGARD BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE. YET TWO YEARS OUT BEFORE THE TESTING IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED. I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING THAT I JUST WANTED YOU HAVE SINCE I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT. I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO. HAVE THE EXPERTS LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE THERE IS AS I IT TESTIFIED WE ARE FINDING THAT LED IS MOST TOXIC TO CHILDREN UNDER SIX AND EVEN MORE TOXIC TO CHILDREN UNDER TWO. UM AND INFANTS AND BABIES BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSUMING MORE WATER AND OBSERVED AND ABSORBING MORE LEAD SO THERE MAY BE AN AGE DIFFERENTIAL. THE EXPERTS WOULD BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT. FOR. SO I I THINK WE'VE PRETTY WELL DEFINED AT I DON'T KNOW IF. THE VICE CHAIR IS. HAPPY OR NOT BUT. BUT AT LEAST I THINK WE'VE DEFINED ENOUGH FOR YOU NOW OKAY GOOD. ALRIGHT. ARM. SEE YOU HAVE WE HAVE A MOTION YET. YES YES OKAY. ALRIGHT THERE'S BEEN IN MOTION AND A SECOND. I'D LIKE YOU TO CLOSE. WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I AM ALWAYS A SERVE SHOCK SOMETIMES WHAT I SEE ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED THROUGH LEGISLATION OR SOME TYPE OF. ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS IN THIS IS ONE OF THEM. WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. ARE IN SHOCK FOR CHILDCARE FACILITIES EVERY SINGLE DAY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY'RE EXPOSED OF THIS BECOMES A VERY NECESSARY BILL TO PUT A LIGHT AND. ATTENTION IN A VERY IMPORTANT AREA AND START TO TREAT OUR YOUNGEST AS WE TREAT OUR OLDEST. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I'VE OF. TORRENT. ARM I'LL GIVE YOU THE I'VE OF. PURCHASE OF MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY HOLDEN THE MOTION IS DUE PASS IN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. MULLIN IS NOT VOTING ARAMBULA. PEROT. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN I'VE HOLDEN AYE MATTEUCCI NOT HERE SAID THREE VOTES. HOLD IT OF. ALL RIGHT ARM IS ANYONE'S DO WE HAVE ANY AUTHORS BESIDES ME WERE HAVING PRETENDED YET.

AT THE GAVEL HERE ALRIGHT I'LL TAKE MY OF BILLS IN NUMERICAL ORDER. TOP FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE. THE STAFF HERE AND IN MY OWN STAFF. THIS IS NOT AN AREA WHERE I LEGISLATED UNTIL I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I'M VERY PLEASED NOW. TO WORK IN THAT. MISTER MURSHID SHOULD YOU WANT TO PRESENT BEFORE I DO OUR NOW YOU'RE OKAY CHAIR ALRIGHT. IF IF YOU. NEED TO. YOU CAN INTERRUPT ME AFTER ANYONE OF THE BALES IF YOU NEED TO. PRESENT SO. WE'LL START NOW WITHOUT MY FIRST BILL. OKAY SO. MADAM VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR BEING HERE TODAY. AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA MOSQUITO SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAM. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN IS CAL SERVE OPERATES AS A CENTRALIZED DATABASE USED BY LOCAL MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL AGENCIES. UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. CAL SERVE IS CURRENTLY MANAGED WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS. THOUGH CAP THROUGH CAL SERVE THIS GROUP MAY COLLABORATE SHARE INFORMATION TRACK MOSQUITO POPULATIONS THAT POSE. PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS SUCH AS ZECA OR WEST NILE. MISKITO SURVEILLANCE IS CRUCIAL FOR TRACKING ELIMINATING AND PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF MOSQUITOES AND THE DISEASES THEY CARRY. BY ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADMINISTER CAO SERVE. NOW WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST KEEP IT THE UNIVERSITY AND THE ANSWER IS. PROFESSOR HAS BEEN DOING THIS HAS RETIRED. AND THERE IS NO ONE AT THE UNIVERSITY TAKEOVER THAT PROGRAM. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY A PROGRAM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HOWEVER ARE WHEN THE. I I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL EXACTLY Y. PUT IT BUT WHEN WE HAVE ALL THE BUDGET. I WAS GONNA SAY SOMETHING HIT THE FAN BUT WE HAVE ALL THE BUDGET PROCESSES. WHERE WE HAD NO MONEY AND WE'RE CUTTING BILLIONS IT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS? THEY JUST DECIDED TO ELIMINATE THIS PROGRAM AND THE PROBLEM IS. IT'S IT'S IT'S A LARGE DATABASE THAT HAS MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING AND NEEDS TO BE PRESERVED. SO THERE WAS A PROFESSOR AT YOU SEE WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE IT OVER. SO BY ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADMINISTER CAL SERVE THIS BILL LEGITIMIZES THE EFFORTS IN RESEARCH BEING DONE THROUGH CAL SERVE. AS A NECESSARY PLATFORM FOR IMPROVING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH. AND RISK REDUCING MOSQUITO AND OTHER VECTOR BORNE DISEASES. WITH ME TODAY IS GENERAL BUCKNER GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE PLASTER MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICT. AND BANESCO QUE HINA. WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSORS THE MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. IRATE WONDERFUL THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK ABOUT WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF ASKING HIM I WITH KITTY PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF MOSQUITO VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. RIPLEY'S TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY TWO WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA MOSQUITO SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAL SERVE IN STATE STATUTE. THE BILL SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THIS AND CODIFIES EXISTING OPERATIONS. CAL SERVICE A PROGRAM THAT STRANGELY MANAGED BY UC DAVIS AND ECAC. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT PROVIDES CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND STORAGE RELATED THE PRESENCE OF MOSQUITOES AND MISKITO BORN DISEASES AROUND THE STATE. TOLD SO PROVIDES LOCAL MOSQUITO CONTROL AGENCIES WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION ON WHERE MOSQUITOES MIGHT EMERGE SPEAKING BEST COMBAT THEIR SPREAD. THE STATE HOUSE SUPPORTED MOSQUITO RESEARCH IN THE PAST AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE'VE BEEN WITHOUT THAT SUPPORT. THE DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT WE'RE FACING NEW NON NATIVE SPECIES OF MOSQUITOES TO TRANSMIT REALLY BAD STUFF LIKE ZECA DENGUE CHIKUNGUNYA AND ELLOW FEVER. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE WORK THAT OUR MEMBERS ALREADY DO TO COMBAT WEST NILE WHICH HAS BEEN PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS NOW AND CONTINUES TO AFFECT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. BEING ABLE TO TRACK AND MONITOR THE PRESENCE OF DISEASE TRANSMITTING MOSQUITOES AND THERE EXISTS KEY COMPONENT TO PREVENTING DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND CONTROLLING MOSQUITO POPULATIONS. THE CELTS ARE PROGRAMS WHERE THE MOST CUTTING EDGE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE GLOBALLY TO DO THIS. AND BASS OF MOSQUITOES HAVE BEEN DETECTIVE IN OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND TWELVE COUNTIES INCLUDING POPULOUS URBAN AREAS WHERE THE UP OPPORTUNITY FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS PRESENT. TODAY I AM JOINED BY JEWEL DETENER THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE PLOTS MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICT COOL DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT WAYS THE CALCIUM HELPS LOCAL MOSQUITO CONTROL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY GET AHEAD OF THEIR WORK. AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHT NINETY TWO SIMPLY CODIFIES CAL SERVES CRITICAL ROLE IN PUBLIC HEALTH REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS ADVOCACY ON THIS AN OUNCE TRIGGER A VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TEXT WITNESSES ALRIGHT THANK YOU ARE VERY MUCH MY NAME IS JOE OPENER I AM THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE PLASTER. YOU DON'T VECTOR CONTROL DISTRICT. MY DISTRICTS BEEN USING CAL SIR SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND AT WE IS IT ON A DAILY BASIS AND NOT TO SAY IT'S A. FANCY DATABASE MIGHT BE OUR UNDERSTANDING SOMEWHAT. IT'S REALLY APPOINT A COLLABORATION FOR OVER FIFTY TWO AND AGENCIES IN THE STATE. MITT CURRENTLY HAS THAT AS OF THE END OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. ALMOST A ONE AND A HALF MILLION RECORDS OF. MISKITO COLLECTIONS ABOUT THREE AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND I HAD A TEST FOR THE WEST NILE VIRUS OR THE VECTOR BORNE DISEASE AND A WHOLE SLEW OF OTHER INFORMATION. ON YOU KIND OF THINK OF IT AS A AYE IN ORDER TO TO INTERPRET A WEATHER REPORT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT'S RAINING. AND IT'S NOT AS EASY AS JUST LOOKING OUTSIDE WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS DATA FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLACES IN A STANDARDIZED AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANNER. AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS OR DOES IT GIVES US A WAY TO PUT IT AND. IT EXPOSES THIS DATA TO A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS AND OUR FOLKS MUCH SMARTER THAN MYSELF WHO CAN MAKE SENSE OF IT A AND THEN REPORT BACK TO US REALLY I'M. SIGNIFICANT DATA THAT WE CAN USE TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION THE TERMS A CONTROLLER PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH ON A DAILY BASIS. ON THIS THIS WORKS WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A LARGE DISTRICT WITH LOTS OF RESOURCES ARE TO ME AND. OPERATION NAM IN SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU PUT THE MOSQUITOES AND IF YOU PUT THE DATA AND YOU CAN GET OUT INFORMATION. THAT'S RELEVANT TO YOU. MOSQUITOES DON'T TERM. I RESPECT POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. SO. THE CALCIUM HELPS US DEAL AT THAT TIME I IT OPENS THE ABILITY FOR A GROUP TO DISTRICTS TO TAKE ON A REGIONAL APPROACH. I MYSELF USE THAT DATA SHARING WITH THE ABOUT SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN SUTTER YUBA COUNTY BECAUSE OUR MOSQUITOS MOVE AROUND ALL THAT AREA WITHOUT THAT'S I WOULD ONLY KNOW THAT MY DISTRICTS COLLECTING. AND WOULD BE A CUMBERSOME PROCESS TO GO AROUND AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON BEYOND OUR BORDERS SO WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE. WE CAN PUT OUT LESS PESTICIDE WHEN WE NEED IT AND WE CAN PUT IT OUT WHEN WE DO NEED IT AND WE CAN KEEP OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. AND PUBLIC HEALTHY. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I AM I URGE YOU TO GIVE US AN AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO.

THE MONEY FROM THIS FEE WOULD GO TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT WOULD THEN PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS OF SINGLE FAMILY AND OR MULTI FAMILY HOMES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLEANING UP LEAD PAINT THAT HAS CONTAMINATED OR HOW. THE BET BILL STATES THE FEE WILL ONLY BE IMPOSED IF INITIATIVE PASSES THE STATE. THAT LEAD PAINT IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE AND THAT DOES THE ACTION OF THE COURTS. ADDITIONALLY THE FEE WOULD BE USED TO PAY FOR THE BOND INSTEAD OF USING GENERAL TAXPAYER MONEY. THAT WOULD ALSO THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO FUNDING EDUCATION HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. LET HAS BEEN LISTED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S PROP SIXTY FIVE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A SUBSTANCE. THAT CAN CAUSE REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGING BIRTH WELL YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT LAND. WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH HALF. HOUSE SOLD PAINT THAT CONTAIN LEAD WAS SOLD IN YEARS IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES LEAD PAINT. LEAD BASED PAINT REMOVAL COSTS ARE ESTIMATED EIGHT TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. REMOVING ALL LEAD PAINT FROM A HOUSE OF TWELVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET WAS RUN AS MUCH AS TEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE AVERAGE REMOVAL PROJECT. WOULD BROWN WITH OF SMALLER HOUSES THAT ARE PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S WHEN THE. REGULATIONS WERE PUT OUT TO FOR DEAD LET DEATH PAIN HOMES. THE STATE THAT DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICATED FUNDING SOURCE TO PROGRAM THE SUFFICIENTLY EQUIPPED TO REMEDIATE THEIR ABATE THE LEAD PAINT AND HAMS. STATEWIDE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AFTER THIRTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION. SANTA CLARA SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE JAMES. OUR KLEINBERG FOUND THAT PAINT MANUFACTURE SOLD LEAD CONTAMINATED PAINT. KNOWING THAT OPPOSED TO SERIOUS HEALTH RISK TO RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT PAINT MANUFACTURERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAINS REMOVER ABATE THE LAD. IT OBVIOUSLY IT'S REMOVAL IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION OF SAILING THE PAIN AS WELL AS A SOLUTION. AND THAT'S GOING TO BE CHEAPER THAN. THEN REMOVING IT. AND SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE CO WAIT I'VE GOT MORE. CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ISSUED DECLINED TO HEAR THE APPEAL OF SOLIDIFYING THE TRIAL COURT'S JUDGMENT AND CONTINUING TO HOLD PAINT MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE. IN SPITE OF THE COURT'S FINDING LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS ARE PROPOSING INITIATIVE IN NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATEWIDE BALLOT THAT WERE REVERSED THE COURT'S RULING. PACIFIC LEE THE INITIATIVE WOULD REALLY PAINT MANUFACTURERS OF LIABILITY. I AND UNDER THE ACTION BY MULTIPLE COURTS AND PUT THE SOLE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS IN THE STATE.

WELL JUST BRIEFLY SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT ADJECTIVE TO USE ABOUT THIS BILL IT'S A CLEVER OR IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT IT'S JUST THE RIGHT RESPONSE IN THIS CASE. TO MAKE SURE THAT OF THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES PAY FOR ANY REMEDIATION NOT CONSUMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES WISHING TO COME FOR IN TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. MICHAEL RATIGAN ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. PLEASE COME FOR EATING MC THE TABLE HERE. A GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR MEMBERS I'M LAURIN DE VALENCIA HERE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN CUTTING ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA UP PAINT COUNCIL. I RESPECTFULLY HERE IN OPPOSITION TO AB THREE THOUSAND AND NINE. AND. A CA IS A VOLUNTARY NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF PAINTS AND COATINGS IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF A SERIOUS DOMESTIC CUTTINGS MARKET AND THAT INCLUDES I'M FIFTEEN. COATINGS MANUFACTURES WITH FACILITIES CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA PINK COUNCIL IS THAT AN ADVOCACY NETWORK OF EASY REPRESENTING. BOTH BIG AND SMALL MANUFACTURERS. I'M SO. AC NCPC HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF SPONSORING AWARENESS EFFORTS IN EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THE SAFE AND PROPER ACTION RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. ARISING FROM OLD DETERIORATED PAINS I EASIER HAS ACTIVELY FOLLOWED AND ADVISE THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PROCESS ON THESE ISSUES AND SUPPORTS INDUSTRY COMPLIANCE ON LEAD BASED PAINT. AND WE DO THIS THROUGH REQUIRE TESTING PRODUCT LABELING AND OTHER CONSUMER SUPPORT EFFORTS. IN ADDITION OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURYTHE PAINT INDUSTRY HAS WORKED WITH MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING ON THE DANGERS OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING. AND THE CITY FOR REMOVAL OF THE LEAD BASED PAINT FOR RESIDENTIAL HOMES. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT AB THREE THOUSAND NINE ONLY GOES INTO EFFECT IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES. HOWEVER ECA NCPC DO NOT SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT IS CRAFTED TO FOCUS SOLELY ON A SINGLE IDENTIFIED PATHWAY OF LEAD POISONING BY IGNORING THE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF LEAD EXPOSURE. AND THAT OF THAT CONTRIBUTE TO IDENTIFIED HEALTH RISKS ANY REMEDY AND THE REQUIRED FUNDING MUST BE BASED ON ACTUAL UNDERLYING PUBLIC HEALTH DATA. AND ANY APPROACHES THAT FOCUS SOLELY ON LEAD BASED PAINT OR CONCERNING. EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE LAW HAVE BOTH DEFINE THE PROBLEM AND ACTIONABLE REMEDIES FOR ADDRESSING LEAD BASED PAINT HATTER HAZARDS INCLUDING. THE CALIFORNIA CHILDHOOD LEAD PREVENTION PROGRAM. USE OF THESE REMEDIES AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAVE PRODUCED MEANINGFUL REDUCTIONS IN LEAD EXPOSURE ARISING FROM PAIN SOURCES. HOWEVER IN MANY CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY LED SORT LED FROM OTHER SOURCES I AM SUCH AS THOSE THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY LIKE I'M DRINK WHAT DRINKING WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. HAVE BEEN A MORE RECENT CONTRIBUTOR TO LEAD EXPOSURE. AND SO AB THREE THOUSAND NINE APPLIES ENTIRELY TO ONE INDUSTRY FURTHER THE BILL NEGLECT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NATURE THAT THE PAIN OF THE PAINT INDUSTRY OR THE FACT THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES. ON MAY NOT HAVE ACTUALLY MANUFACTURE LEAD PAINT OR EVEN BEEN IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE BAND USE AND SALE OF CONSUMER LEAD BASED PAINT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WISHING INCOME FOR AND TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOPE A CASE WILL BRING IN APPEARED TO THE DIET IS FOR DISCUSSION ANYONE. ANYONE KNOW. OKAY QUESTION. MR. SO UP AND MISTER CHAIR I IDEA. NOT SURE IF I MISS THIS BUT. I KNOW THAT I A COMMON ARGUMENT OF A. OF THE INDUSTRY IS IS IS THAT. AND THE. A. HE IS GOING TO BE JUST PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER. HERE YOUR RESPONSE THE WELL THAT'S UP TO THE PAINT COMPANIES AND THAT'S NOTHING HERE RAISES THE PRICE. BOB. SO. THAT'S MY ANSWER. BUT IN TERMS OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SIR. MAKING THE POINT ABOUT AB THREE THOUSAND NINE WOULD APPLY TO THE POLLUTER PAYS PRINCIPLE THAT. SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD YOU KNOW THE BEST THING TO DO. IS. UP FIRST WHILE MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID ARE TRUE THERE MANY SOURCES OF LEAD. OUR BUT WHAT WE HAVE OUR THREE PAINT COMPANY. THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE. AND THEY ARE TRYING TO PASS THIS ON. TO THE TAXPAYERS NO I UNDERSTAND AND ALL THEY HAVE THEIR DO. I TAKE CARE OF THEIR CONCERNS IS JUST ALL DROPPED THIS BILL. IF THEY DROP INITIATIVE. AND IT IS THOSE THREE PAINT COMPANIES THAT ARE CAUSING COMPANIES THAT PERHAPS DID NOT. OF YOU ARE DISTRIBUTING A LEAD PAINT. TO HAVE TO PUT A FEE ON THERE BUT. TO HAVE THESE COMPANIES. TRANSFER THEIR LIABILITY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SOMETHING I WILL NOT TOLERATE. AND NEITHER WOULD I THINK ABOUT YOU BUT I'M ASKING CALL HIM WHETHER THIS BILL. NIGHT. YEAH I THAT'S UP TO THEM. OUR THINKING. ANYTHING FURTHER RISK MURATSUCHI NOW NOW OKAY ANYONE ELSE. OKAY EX WITHOUT. RIGHT I HAD SOME COMMENTS FIRST BEFORE WE GET TO WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE WANTS TO MAKE A MOTION. I. I HAD TO BE HONEST WITH YOU IP SO I'M WITH YOU ON THE FACT THAT IT'S REPREHENSIBLE THAT. I'M SOME OF THESE THE THREE PAINT COME IN COMPANIES DID WHAT THEY DID. AND THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH THAT RESPONSIBILITY OFF ON SOMEONE ELSE. BUT I AGREE WITH OUR COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT THAT BURDEN SHOULD NOT THEN BE FURTHER PLACED ON THE CUSTOMER WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT THAT PAIN COMPANIES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ABSORB THAT COST IS GOING TO BE PASSED ON TO YOU AND ME AND ANYONE ELSE WHO BUYS PAINT. ó BY THE WAY I'M NOT THE ONE TO PUT THE LEAD IN THE PAINT SO I DON'T SEE WHY I STEP TO PAY FOR IT. AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE WHO'S PURCHASING PAINT OUT THERE PROBABLY FEELS THE SAME WAY SO I'M WITH YOU THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE I GET WHY YOU'RE DOING IT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY THE WAY THE BILL IS STRUCTURED THE PEOPLE END UP PAYING ARE. THE PEOPLE HER WALKING INTO YOU KNOW HOMEDEPOT OR LOWES OR WHEREVER IT AND PURCHASING PAINT SO. I'M FOR THERE'S REASONS UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DAY. PARTNER SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. KNOWING. SO WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND IF THIS BILL IS TO MOVE FORWARD. SECOND WAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TEHAMA MADAM CLERK WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WAIT I DIDN'T BEHIND IT ARE YOU WANTING LOS SURE ESR WANNA CLEAN USUALLY YEAR SO BRIEF IN YOUR PRESENCE. YOUR BILL YEAH I I JUST WANNA PUT FORWARD SHOW YOU SAY THAT IT WILL BE CONSUMERS THAT PAY FOR. THE PROBLEM IS IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS FEE. IT'LL STILL BE THE TAXPAYERS OF THE STATE. AND THAT MEANS LESS MONEY FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO PREVENT HERE. AND AGAIN I WOULD VERY MUCH* THE OTHER PAINT COMPANIES TO OPPOSE. THIS INITIATIVE BY THE THREE PAINT COMPANIES THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE THANK YOU. CERTAINLY HIGH MADAM CITY MADAM CLERK. IT'S IS ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN AB THREE ZERO ZERO NINE QUIRK THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION. QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MELINDA'S NO MELINDA'S NO. ARAMBULA. BROKE. BRUNO. FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I. MAURIZIO CHEAP HIGH. MURATSUCHI I. FOR TWO. OKAY THANK YOU. ALRIGHT NOT LEAST ITEM SIXTEEN A. B. THIRTY FOURTEEN. ALRIGHT CHAU. MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AB THIRTY FOURTEEN PROVIDES A NARROW EXCEPT DECEPTION. REGARDING COPPER AMOUNTS IN BRAKE PADS FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE AND TRACK CAPABLE VEHICLES. IN TWENTY TEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. THREE FOUR SIX KEY HOW. THAT BEGAN TO RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF COPPER USED IN MOTOR VEHICLE BRAKE PADS. VEHICLES SOLD IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT CONTAIN MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT COPPER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND NO MORE THAN POINT FIVE PERCENT IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. ACCORDING TO RESEARCH EXCESS AMOUNTS OF COPPER FROM AUTO BRAKE PADS WERE AFFECTING FISH AND OTHER ORGANISMS SPECIFICALLY AND URBAN WATERSHEDS. WHILE THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS WORKING TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOAL. IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT SUCH AN EXEMPTION MUST BE MADE. ONLY FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE AND TRACK CAPABLE VEHICLES. THESE VEHICLES WHICH CAN MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE GOALS BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOALS. THESE VEHICLES WHICH ARE TYPICALLY VEHICLES THE CAN BE DRIVEN ON BOTH THE ROAD IN A RACE TRACK. SPECIALIZED PARTS THAT MAKE THEM CAPABLE OF BEING DRIVEN AT HIGH SPEEDS ON A TRACK. ALEC. THANK YOU. I ADEQUATE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO COPPER BASED BRAKE PADS. THAT WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I DEADLINE A FIVE PERCENT OR LESS. THERE FOR A BE THIRTY FOURTEEN PROVIDES THESE TRACK CAPABLE VEHICLES. WITH A NARROW EXCEPT EXEMPTION FROM THAT DEADLINE BUT CONTINUES TO HOLD THESE VEHICLES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. DEADLINE. THESE MANUFACTURERS ARE. BEING. I THINK VERY RESPONSIBLE TELLING US AHEAD OF TIME WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO AND MAKING SURE THAT THE. P. AYE TOUGHER STANDARD THEY WILL MEET IN TIME. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS EXEMPTION AGAIN WOULD ONLY APPLY THE HIGH PERFORMANCE IN TRACK CAPABLE VEHICLES. WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FORM. A PROPER DEFINITION FOR SUCH VEHICLES TO ENSURE THE EXEMPTION DOES NOT APPLY TO A BROADER RANGE OF AUTOMOBILES. AND WITH ME TODAY AND TESTIFYING SUPPORT IS A BEEF AVE B. THIRTY FOURTEEN. IS MICHELLE. RUPERT COLVILLE. WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MUCH SUBTLER GOV ON BEHALF OF THE AUTO ALLIANCE THE ALLIANCE IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF TWELVE ON MANUFACTURERS AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY FOURTEEN A. B. THIRTY FOURTEEN PROVIDES AN ARAB EXEMPTION FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE TRACK CAPABLE VEHICLES AND THE BREAK FRICTION MATERIALS USED ON THESE VEHICLES. FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE INTERMEDIATE DEADLINE. THE ALLIANCE WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF WORKING WITH LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS AND OTHERS TO PUT THE CURRENT PROVISIONS OF LAW AND PLACE BACK IN TWENTY TEN. SINCE THAT TIME OUR MEMBERS HAVE WORK TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW AND HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DONE SO IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE. HOWEVER AS THE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY POINTS OUT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS BIRTH REGARDS TO HIGH PERFORMANCE TRACK READY VEHICLES HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. AYE ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE ALLIANCE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS AND IN SOME CASES BE AHEAD OF THE FINAL DEADLINE SET FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. HOWEVER FOR THIS SMALL SUBSET OF CARS WE WOULD SUPPORT THE EXEMPTION GRANTED IN AB THIRTY FOURTEEN AND ASK FOR YOUR IBOOK. WONDERFUL THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. NOW IS THERE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO STE TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TWEENER HERE TWEENER OKAY TWEENER SPURS. YOU'RE TOO WIENER. OKAY TWEENER IS GOING UP THE COMMITTEES AND A LOT OF TIME BUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO TWEENER IS WHICH ORDINARILY WE DON'T AFFORD THE TWO MINUTE TIMEFRAME TO IF YOU COULD KEEP IT A VERY BRIEF WE'D APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT MORE TOP ON BEHALF OF THE. CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE WERE A CO SPONSORS OF THAT MEASURE. EIGHT YEARS AGO. AND. PART OF THE EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE ON THAT BILL TO FIND THAT DELICATE BALANCE. AND. BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S THE CITY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF. OF. COSTS FOR OUR TMDL THAT WE'RE FACING. I'M BUT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS CAME TO US EARLY. ON TO TRY AND TALK ABOUT THIS EXEMPTION. AND. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AND WE THINK THAT WE CAN. WHAT WE HAVE OUR DUE DILIGENCE THAT WE NEED TO TO WORK THROUGH TO SEE HOW MUCH WIGGLE ROOM WE HAVE WITHIN OUR TMDL? AT THIS POINT. BUT WE. WE THINK THAT WE CAN NOT FIND THAT SWEET SPOT SIR. TO NARROW THE DEFINITION EVEN FURTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER EXEMPTION IS PROVIDED ULTIMATELY THAT IT'S AS NARROWLY DRAWN AS POSSIBLE SET UP YOU WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ISSUE THAT IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE HE WANTS TO TESTIFY IS BETWEEN US OUR STATE EVOLVING FROM SUSTAINABLE. CONSERVATION THE OTHER CO SPONSOR OF S. B. THREE FORTY SIX I WOULD ECHO WHAT MS TOP SAID. PAPA ARE CONCERNED IS ONCE AGAIN THAT THE THIS THIS EXEMPTION BE AS NARROW IT NARROWLY TAILORED AS POSSIBLE. AS ALL OF THE INFORMATION S. B. THREE FORTY SIX WAS THE RESULT OF A PROCESS THAT TOOK OVER FIFTEEN YEARS. TO DETERMINE THE PROPER SCIENTIFIC AND AND. POLICY ARE LEVELS OF THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS EXEMPTION AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE OTHER EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE BILL IS BASED ON THE ACTUAL. AMOUNT OF COPPER THAT THESE CARS GENERATE SO IT'S BOTH THE IT'S SO THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION ON BOTH THE THE PERCENTAGE OF COPPER IN THE BRAKE PADS IN THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO. SO THAT WE GET A PROPER ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS MIGHT BE BUT WE LOOK FORWARD VERY MUCH TO WORKING WITH WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF WE WE WORK WITH A M.. WHAT GETTING THE BILL PASSED AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO IT AGAIN? AREN'T WE HOPE WON'T TAKE FIFTEEN YOUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS.

WONDERFUL THANK YOU. AND I'LL JUST REITERATE THE I MAN THREE OF ENTER WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION I'M ALSO CATCHING UP ON THE BILL SO OPEN TO UP TO LEARNING MORE BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WORKING ON TEAM DEALS PARTICULAR ON SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

TO PROTECT FISH IN THE BAY THAT IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. THAT WE MAY BE GETTING IN THE WAY OF THAT AND WE'RE NOT CLEAR YET WE'RE NOT THERE YET AS TO WHY. WE COULD ACCEPT AN EXCEPTION EXEMPTION BUT OPEN TO TALKING TO YOU FURTHER ABOUT IT. I THINK IT'S GOOD IF UP TMDL WAS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES HERE ARE WHICH I WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO GIVE A DEFINITION. SURE HER FEATURE A TEAM DE OUR TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD IS. UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT IF IT WILL PUT AWAY IS IMPAIRED BY A CONTAMINANT IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COPPER BUT IT COULD BE ANYTHING ELSE. UP WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF THAT THAT WATER BODY COULD MAINTAIN AND STILL. HONOR AND AND. AND STUFF I FELL IT'S BENEFICIAL USES IN THIS CASE IT WOULD INCLUDE FISH AND FISHING. AND SO. UNDER THAT THE STATE IS REQUIRED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT. WOULD BRING THAT WATER BACK INTO COMPLIANCE WITH WATER QUALITY STANDARDS UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. AND REPORT A CLUMP THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SEE WE HAVE ONE MORE PERSON HE WANTS TO ADD HIS NAME AND ANY MARIN ON THE OFFICE HERE CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE VISION YET BUT THE SPEAKERS NICELY CAPTURED OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY SO WE CAN BRING IT BACK UP HERE TO THE DIET IS FOR ANY DISCUSSION FOR MEMBERS MISTREATMENT. I HAVE A QUESTION MAYBE FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE AUTO INDUSTRY. I TRACK CAPABLE WHEN I HEAR TRACK CAPABLE. I THINK OF RACE CARS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. HI IN BMWS AND LEXUS'S THAT KIND OF VEHICLE CRACKED SO THEY'RE AUTOMOBILES THAT MAY LOOK LIKE A REGULAR ON A BILL BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PARTS AND EQUIPMENT THAT DO ALLOW THEM TO BE. RACE TYPE CARS THAT ARE ABLE TO RUN ON A TRACK AND GO UP TO THOSE SPEEDS THAT. YOU WOULD THINK OF AS A RACE CAR WITH THAT THESE CARS ARE SOLD THOUGH AS PEOPLE'S PRIMARY MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AROUND TOWN. THEY'RE BOTH ROAD READY IN TRACK READY SO YOU COULD DRIVE THEM ON THE FREEWAY YES. BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND WITH THESE VEHICLES ARE HOW MANY OF THE OF THE SIX PERCENT OF THE CARS ON THE ROAD. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER I CAN GET IT TO YOU BUT IT'S. IT'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF A VERY SMALL SAID MANUFACTURERS NOT ALL THE MANUFACTURERS DO THEM THE ONES THAT DO IT'S A VERY SMALL IT'S IT WOULD BE LIKE YOUR FERRARIS. THOSE TYPE OF VERY HIGH PERFORMANCE. ARE YOU SURE BECAUSE MY FRIEND BOUGHT WE'LL GET YOU KNOW I'M W. THAT S. U. V.. THAT HAS A POWER MODE THAT MIGHT THAT THAT I THINK MIGHT UNDER YOUR DEFINITION QUALIFY AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF GOES TO WHAT I THINK SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE AT LEAST FOR ME AND I THINK TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENT WE ARE GOING TO. DEFINE A LOAN OR LOOK INTO DEFINING WHAT IS ATTRACT READY YOUR TRACK CAPABLE VIA YEAH IT'S TO MAKE IT AS NARROW AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT AND AND CLEARLY WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT NUMBER DOWN. YOU CAN.

VIRTUALL THE WHOLE TIME SHALL. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT. OUR LAST BILL DEATH MR MARIS YUCHI BACK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM HERE TO. AND IT A PRESENTER AB. THIRTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT. WHICH BASICALLY SEEKS TO MAKE THE MAC INCREASE THE MAX MONTHS. ADMINISTRATIVE A PENALTY YOU. FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. PER DAY FOR ANY CALIFORNIA ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM VIOLATION. WELL AS MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KNOW. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME A PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT THAT TORRANCE REFINERY AYE HANDLES. ONE OF THESE HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT THE. CAL A. R. P. OR CAL ARE. A PROGRAM ADDRESSES THE THE HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID. THAT IF A RELEASED A COULD POTENTIALLY THREATEN THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE VICINITY OF THE REFINERY. AND SO IT IS PRECISELY FOR THIS KIND OF. A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL THAT THE CAL A. R. P. IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS TO TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE CAN. PROVIDED THE. SIGNIFICANT DETERRENCE TO. ACCIDENTAL RELEASES OF THESE TYPE OF. TOXIC OR FLAMMABLE CHEMICALS. RIGHT NOW THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A. AND SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE BUCKET. FOR FOR MANY OF THE TARGETS OF THESE. CAL A. R. P.. VIOLATIONS THAT THE COOPERS OR THE CERTIFY UNIFY PROGRAM AGENCIES GO AFTER. WE NEED TO. INCREASE THE MAXIMUM PENALTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THAT DETERRENT EFFECT I'M HERE. WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COOPER HAS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JUST MULLIN FOR THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTIVES THAT WE REPRESENT THE COOPERS AND VERY VERY QUICKLY WE JUST WANNA SAY WE TRY TO BRING. SOME OF THESE FINES AND PENALTIES UP TO A MORE REASONABLE LEVEL. YOU MAY RECALL THIS COMMITTEE VOTED ACT AND YOU CARRIED THE BILL THAT INCREASE THE FINES AND PENALTIES TO SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THIS IS A LOT LESS THAN THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE VERY. VERY S. SIGNIFICANT CHEMICALS HERE I THINK YOU ANALYSIS WAS EXCELLENT AT REALLY LAID IT OUT AND WE DO HAVE SOME SMALL AMENDMENTS THAT. A THE OPPOSITION WANTED US TO TAKE RANDY WILL EXPLAIN THOSE AMENDMENTS HERE BUT WITH THAT. WE HAPPY AND WE HOPE THAT YOU YOU'LL SUPPORT BILL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN QUIRK IN THEM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. BASICALLY AND MY NAME IS RANDY SAWYER I'M I'M THE CHIEF ENVIRONMENT HEALTH AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OFFICER IN CONTRA COSTA CANYON. I I'M REPRESENTING THE IN CALIFORNIA IF I PROGRAM AGENCY FORMER COOPER FORUM. I WHICH SAYS THAT WOULDN'T STATED WITH A REPRESENTS EVERY LOCAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AGENCY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO BASICALLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED THEIR PROPOSED ARE. BASED ON WHAT NOW WE HAVE IT UP TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY IS THE MINIMUM. THAT WOULD INCREASE THAT TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY THERE WOULD BE INCREASED TO FIVE THOUSAND A. AND THE SECOND SECTION WHERE IT NOW SAYS NO ONLY AFTER REASON ONE NOTICED. IT COULD BE GO UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE MINUTE WHICH TRACK AT STRIKE OUT THE AFTER RECENTLY NOTICED ANDTHAT WOULD BASICALLY MEAN IF THEY KNOWINGLY MAKE IT HAVE A VIOLATION WHICH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO KNOW. IT WOULD INCREASE UP TO TWENTY IT COULD INCREASE UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THERE'S OTHER OTHER TO ONE OTHER. PIECE IT'S AMENDED IT WILL ALSO EXEMPT TO PIECES OF A TWO SECTIONS OF THE. THIS ARTICLE DATA COVERS A CALIFORNIA EXTENDS PREVENTION PROGRAM. PUT EM BASED GOOD POINT SECTION TWENTY FIVE FIVE THREE SIX POINT SEVEN TWENTY FIVE BY THREE SIX POINT SIX. THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN BASICALLY WAS IHAD TO DO WITH CONTRACTORS SAFETY. WHICH IS KIND OF MIXED WITH THAT CALLOSUM. AND THE LOCAL COOPER IS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR SOMETIMES WHO MIGHT HAVE JURISDICTION. AND AND THIS WOULD THIS WOULD TAKE THAT PIECE OUT TO MAKE IT CLEAR FOR THE REST OF THE ARTICLE. AND IN TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY FIVE BY THIRTY SIX POINT SIX HAS TO DO WITH. A BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. I MET MISTER MISTER YOUR MARRIED SHE WAS A THE ART THERE FOR WITH HAVING TO DO WITH COMMUNITY WARNING SYSTEMS. AND IT BASICALLY WOULD. THIS WOULD EXEMPT. LOCAL AGENCY WHO WERE AMPLE WHAT COLOR EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES FROM THESE PENALTIES AND FINES AT TO IMPLEMENT THAT THAT SECTION OF IT. I WE'RE OAK AND INTO COOPER FORM BOARD IS OKAY WITHIN MINUTES IF THE AUTHORS OKAY WITH AMOUNTS OF MIA. SO THOSE ARE ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS WHICH THE WITH RESPECT TO ASK FOR. THAT IS CORRECT. YEAH I KNOW BUT TWO OF THEM ACTUALLY HELP YOU OUT SO. ARE THEY WERE VERY GENEROUS. RIGHT. OTHERS ARE IN SUPPORT. AND NO ONE ELSE ALRIGHT ANYONE AND NOW I'M HOPING OPPOSITION THAT WAS REMOVED. OUR BY WHISPER WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE A CONCERN MISTER CHAIR I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SHARED I I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE. OF REPRESENTATIVES OF OF THE OPPOSITION AND. WHILE WE HAVE NOT ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENT SALAS POINTS. WE. HAVE COMMITTED TO. THAT MADE A GOOD FAITH COMMITMENT TO THE OPPOSITION AND AND TO TAKE UP THE AMENDMENTS. BUT SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SO WE ARE HIGH I DON'T IT QUITE UNDERSTAND. YOU WILL TAKE THE AMENDMENTS IN JUDICIARY OR YOU KNOW ARE CONSIDER TAKING THEM WE WILL I WILL CONSIDER TAKING THEM OKAY THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU. THEN WE STILL HAVE OPPOSITION AB OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. AT EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WE APPRECIATE THAT CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD APPEAR. WE WOULD SAY WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COMMITMENT TO HAVE THESE. AMENDMENTS TAKING COMMITTEE OUT IF THE SPONSORS OF THE BELL. DON'T FIND A PROBLEM WITH THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THOSE I'M TO BE COMMITTED TO TODAY. I'M SHORT OF TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS WE DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE BELL. ODD THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. AS HAS BEEN EXPLAINED INCREASES THE MAXIMUM PENALTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OP PER DAY. THE FOR THE VIOLATION. WE WOULD ALLOW WE'VE BELIEVE THAT THE WAY THAT THIS. IS RIGHT AND THE PROPOSED CHANGES. REALLY DO. EQUATE THEY THEY ELIMINATE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES AND A CRIMINAL PENALTY I'M WE. IN GOOD FAITH HAVE SAID IF THE CUBANS FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO HAVE THE NOTICE PROVISION REMOVED WHERE MORE THAN COMFORTABLE WITH THAT BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT RETAINING THE KNOWING PROVISION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I'M STRIKING BOTH OF THOSE WHICH IS CURRENTLY PROPOSED UNDER THE BELL. DOES BECAUSE THIS SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS SO IT WE HOPE THOSE CAN BE ADDRESSED IN THE WE CAN GET A COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE AND FROM THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO TAKE THOSE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. JEAN URBAN ON BEHALF OF ENDEAVOR I'M. YES WE OFFERED AMENDMENTS THEY WORK ACT CORRECTLY DESCRIBED THEY WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BUT WE HAVE WE HAVE TO OPPOSE A BILL THAT ARE RACES. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN MINOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS AND KNOWING BY. FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED NOTICE I MEAN WE CAN'T AT IT I JUST DON'T THINK IS APPROPRIATE POLICY. TO IT AT EQUATE ALL VIOLATIONS WITH THE SAME PENALTY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ASKED THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER PRESERVATION OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN. PENALTIES AND KNOWING VIOLATIONS WE'VE AGREED TO RAISE THE AMOUNT AND THEN WE'VE AGREED I THINK THIS FOR SOME SURGICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR ABOUT FOR. FOR PROVISIONS TO WHICH THESE PENALTIES WERE NEVER INTENDED TO APPLY. SO I WOULD URGE THE AUTHOR TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS SOONER OR LATER I'M BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL AS WRITTEN. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST ON KHAKI MCCUE CAPTAIN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BALANCE EVEN.
