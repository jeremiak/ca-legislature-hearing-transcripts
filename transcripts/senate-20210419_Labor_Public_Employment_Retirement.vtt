WHAT THE STAFF- I- I DON'T HAVE

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:29.874
A COMPLETE THEN I WOULD NEED A

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.676
COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:34.612
THE DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN.

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:35.080
WHAT IS BEING PROVIDED

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:38.416
CURRENTLY. BY THE STATE TO OUR

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.618
OUR OUR STAFF AND WHAT. THEY'RE

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:43.154
LACKING- AS FAR AS EITHER RIGHT

OR- BENEFITS OR HOURLY. I DON'T

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:49.494
THINK THE I THINK THE IT THE

00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:51.429
EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE US OVER

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.431
TIME THAT'S REALLY BASED ON

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:57.335
MINIMUM WAGE SO- IT'S- KIND OF

00:28:57.402 --> 00:28:59.571
EASY FOR MOST EMPLOYEES FOR

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:01.439
MOST OF. THE SAY THAT THEY'RE

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.641
GETTING PAID OVERTIME BUT IT'S

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.143
JUST ONE EXAMPLE I THINK OF

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.011
WHAT'S NEEDED MORE CLARITY IS

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:10.248
NEEDED- AND I JUST DON'T KNOW

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:13.151
OBVIOUSLY MINIMUM WAGE FOR MOST

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:15.787
IF NOT YOU KNOW OVERWHELMINGLY.

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:19.324
MINIMUM WAGE IS LESS AN ISSUE

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.091
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:29:20.158 --> 00:29:21.359
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE COVERED

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:25.130

STREET AND THERE ARE MANY LOST

MANY MANY LAWS THAT ARE

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.894
BURDENSOME LOS- AND ALL HAVE

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.562
BEEN PASSED FOR A GOOD REASON

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:12.964
IF YOU REALLY DIG INTO THE LAWS

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.332
AND FIND OUT THERE SOME ABUSES

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.067
ABSOLUTELY. ON ON ALL SIDES OF

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.503
LOS. BUT WHEN I CAME TO THE

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:20.138
CAPITAL I WAS JUST BLOWN AWAY

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:22.874
IN THE FACT THAT. OUR OFFICES

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.741
DON'T ABIDE BY THE LAWS THAT WE

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:26.911
PASS. AND YOU KNOW WE HEAR A

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.913
LOT OF SPEECHES ON THE FLOOR

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.882
ABOUT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEE

00:32:30.948 --> 00:32:31.949
RELATIONS AND HOW THE

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:33.951
GOVERNMENT. HOW THE LEGISLATURE

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.853
SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THAT. SO

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.689
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRONG

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:41.225
AWRY- RIGHT OR WRONG THEY

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:43.861
SHOULD SAY GET THAT RIGHT- AND

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.530
THERE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.964
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT THAT'S

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:49.000
JUST WAS NEW TO MY V. BROUGHT

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:51.069
UP TO ME. AND I'LL SHARE THAT

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:53.705
IT THE MINIMUM WAGE IS NOT JUST

00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:57.975
ABOUT THE- IF YOU'RE MAKING. WE

00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.177
DON'T PAY ANY OF OUR EMPLOYERS

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.045
MINIMUM WAGE WE PAY ABOVE THAT

00:33:01.112 --> 00:33:03.381
UP SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT THAT BUT

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:05.183
WE ARE STILL REQUIRED BY LAW.

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:08.386
TO PAY. TIME TIME AND A HALF ON

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:10.188
CERTAIN OUT WHEN THEY MEET

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:12.523
THOSE THRESHOLDS YOU PAY SO- I

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:14.258
KNOW THAT THERE'S VERY FEW

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.159
PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THIS

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:17.028
LEGISLATURE THAT OUR MINIMUM

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.564
WAGE I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THEY'RE

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:20.365
I MEAN I KNOW IT'S MORE THAN

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.400
THAT. BUT DINNER THE DAY THEY

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:24.068
SHOULD STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO.

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:26.304
YOU KNOW WE PASSED A BILL LAST

00:33:26.371 --> 00:33:28.039
YEAR IN THE- SENATE SENATOR

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:29.307
JACKSON BROUGHT THE BILL

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.608
FORWARD ABOUT. IF YOU WANT TO

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.610
TAKE TO OUR LEAVE. AND YOU

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.579
COULD CONSECUTIVE THAT FOR

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:35.346
FIFTEEN WEEKS TWO HOURS AT A

TIME. AND THAT BILL PASSED AND

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.450
SO THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK ARE

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.352
EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE. HAVE THE

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.855
RIGHT TO AS WELL AND SO- FOR

OUR STATE'S SAFETY NET. BUT

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:39.203
EVEN THIS ONE VERY MODEST

PANDEMIC KIT. AND THE AMOUNT OF

00:35:47.945 --> 00:35:49.146
MANY DRIVERS FOUND THEMSELVES

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.748

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.919
EVEN WORSE SOME OF THOSE

PROFITING FROM THEIR WORK. NOW

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.501
WE KNOW THAT COMPANIES USE SOME

00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:12.670
COMPANIES USE ELABORATE SCHEMES

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.138
TO MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:21.646
BUSINESSES LEASE THEM TRACKS

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:22.280
AND THEN TELL THEM TO FIND

00:36:22.346 --> 00:36:24.415
OTHER DRIVERS- OTHER WORKERS TO

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:26.384
DRIVE OTHER SHIFTS ALL OF THIS

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.352
IS MEANT TO CREATE THE ILLUSION

00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.454

TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:26.442

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.777
REPEATED HEARING OF LEGISLATION

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:29.578
SUCH AS THE DRAFTING IT OUT BY

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:32.047
STAFF. ALL OF THOSE STEPS TAKE

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.049
TIME THEY SLOW DOWN LEGISLATION

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.351
JUST LIKE REGULATIONS BUT WE

SEE THOSE UNHEALTHY AND THAT

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.555

LIKE TO GET THAT THE TWO I

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.896
THINK THE BIG ISSUES HERE RIGHT

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.864
I THAT FIRST THE VALUE OF THE

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:50.599
THREE OF PROCESS- FOR BRIEF

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.668
CONTACT- THOROUGHLY THE

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.570

BASIC PREMISE MORE IN DEPTH

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.507
ANALYSIS FOR REGULATIONS THAT

IMPACT OVER FIFTY MILLION

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.577
DOLLARS- I DO WHICH IS WHY DID

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.079
WAS CREATE RECENTLY UNDER AT.

01:08:04.146 --> 01:08:04.647
SIX SEVENTEEN I THOUGHT OUR

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:08.517
CALDERON THAT- AND ONE MEASURE

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.518
OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A FACT

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:13.022
IT- WE CAN LOOK AT THAT IN

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:13.622
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE L. A- THE

JURY A PROCESS AND COMMENTED

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.462
AND I'M QUOTING WE FIND SOME OF

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.497
THE CHANGES HERE HAVE LED TO

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.265
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY AND

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:31.974
CONSISTENCY OF. AGENCIES

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:32.575
ANALYSIS OF MAJOR REGULATION.

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:33.576
BY YOU THE L. A. R. THANK THE

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:34.844
THREE OF THAT HAVE. PROVED THE

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.179
THAT. AND TO THE TO THE POINT

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:38.447
MADE BY THE PROPONENT IS BIT

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.549
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. CAN IN OTHER

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.985
PRETTY GOOD THING OUT.

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:45.254
UNANSWERED STAFF NOW NOTE THE

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.989
POINT THE ONE ASSEMBLY. IS THAT.

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.424
BUT APART OF FINANCE HAS TO

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.259
REVIEW. AND COMMENT ON SURREY

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.061
ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY IT THE

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.028
METHODOLOGY THE CALCULATIONS

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.930
ARE ESSENTIALLY. CORRECT IF

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:55.698
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.366
CALCULATE WHAT IT'S GONNA DO

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.801
THE TO THE ECONOMY WHAT'S GONNA

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.003
CHANGE WILL COST. AND IF YOU

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:03.105
LOOK AT U. S. WEBSITE YOU CAN

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:04.740
VIEW THE OTHER DELAY IN MANY

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.642
CASES WILL PUSH BACK AND SAY NO

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.043
AGENTS YOU'VE DONE THIS MATH

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:10.579
ROCK. NO CHANGE THERE SO TO THE

01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:12.047
IDEA THAT WITHOUT THE PRODUCT

01:09:12.114 --> 01:09:13.082
THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:14.617
DATA JUST AS WELL I THINK THAT

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:17.486
IT'S- IT'S PROVEN. BY DLF

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:21.991
WEIGHING IN ON REGULATIONS.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:22.525
THAT HAVING TO CHANGE THE

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.760
CALCULATION- ALL IT IS EXAMPLE-

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.095
WE TALK THREE THE THING OUT

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:28.531
THERE AND- L. Y. THE ECONOMIC

01:09:28.597 --> 01:09:29.231
IMPACT STATEMENT WHICH IS

01:09:29.298 --> 01:09:31.233
LITERALLY A FIVE PAGE. CHECK

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.102
THE BOX FORM WHICH AGENCIES ARE

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:35.070
REQUIRED TO DO WITH YOU IF YOU

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.405
GET RESTORING AS ALTERNATIVE.

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.873
THAT DID NOT COME ANYWHERE NEAR

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.076
THE DEPTH OF SERBIAN AL PACINO-

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.344
YOU KNOW COULD BE A HUNDRED

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.947
PAGES. OF AND GO TO INDUSTRY TO

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.115
INDUSTRY CALCULATION.

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:47.483
CALCULATION ARE YOU KNOW THE

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.250
LEVEL OF DETAIL IS JUST NOT

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.852
CAPTURED OTHER PLACES SO WHEN

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:55.257
YOU TALK ABOUT THAT VALUE. IT'S.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:55.891
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT IF YOU LOOK

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.726
AT THE DOCUMENTS- THE LAST THE

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.295
TOUCH ID LIKE TO ME- I THINK MR

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:01.564
STEIGER MENTIONED IT SHOULD THE

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.299
ISSUE OF HELLO SHOULD THREE AT

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.967
THE TYPICALLY GOING SLOW

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.468
WAITING ON A CONSOLE TO BE

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.937
PRECISE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:10.472
REASONS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:10:10.539 --> 01:10:11.941
HAVE TAKEN SOME TIME IT BECAUSE

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.475
OF THE SPECIFIC OUTSIDE

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.577
CONSULTING COMPANY CALLUSES

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.011
CHOSEN TO CONTRACT WITH AND

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.213
THEIR WORKLOAD. BUT THAT IS NOT

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.282
A PROBLEM WITH SHARIA OR THE

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:22.418
VALUE OF SERBIA ECONOMICALLY-

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:24.253
INDEED THAT IS A CONSTANT ISSUE

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.121
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:26.655
CONSULTANT THE CALLOUS HAS

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.691
CONTRACTED WITH AND I THINK

01:10:28.757 --> 01:10:30.726
THAT THAT KIND OF ISSUE WHICH

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.595
IS NOT A PROBLEM NOW THIS IS A

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.862
VALUE BUT IT DOES HAVE A

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:36.432
CONTRACTING ISSUE- INTAKE BACK

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.700
ISN'T A REASON TO THROW OUT

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.501
THIS VALUABLE ECONOMIC TOOL AND

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.103
INDEED I THINK THAT THEY AT AT

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:42.504
MISTER SPEAKER NOTED IT IS A

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.506
VALUABLE ECONOMIC IT OUT THESE

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.975
OTHERWISE THE BILL WOULD BE

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:47.042
GETTING RID OF IT FOR ALL

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.510
AGENCIES THAT DOESN'T DO THAT

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:49.878
RIGHT ONLY BECAUSE THE FOR CAL

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:52.047
OSHA. I THINK THAT IN ITSELF

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:53.882
ALSO UNDERLINED THE VALUE THREE

01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:55.551
SO WHILE WE ARE WHAT WE AGREED

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.653
IT DELAYED BEEN DEREGULATION

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.054
THEY'RE NOT IDEAL BUT WE THINK

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.189
THE VALUE OF SHARIA

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:07.429

JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO- WE HEARD

ABOUT GARMENT WORKERS AN ENTIRE

MODEL OF. THE INDUSTRY. UP

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:16.957
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PORT TRUCKERS

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:46.987

TIME CENTER ALERT IS SB

02:24:40.071 --> 02:24:43.541
KNOWLEDGE. THANK YOU- I THINK

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:44.475
THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF THIS

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:47.678
BILL AND ONE BILL IS THE PART

02:24:47.745 --> 02:24:48.312
THAT HAS TO DO WITH HUMAN

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:50.581
RIGHTS. WHERE THE CASE HAS BEEN

02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:53.818
VERY COMPELLINGLY MADE. THE

02:24:53.885 --> 02:24:58.956
SECOND PART IS HOW IF THERE IS.

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.892
AN ECONOMIC ISSUE HOW IT'S

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:03.127
DRIVEN HOME I THINK THAT PART

02:25:03.194 --> 02:25:05.396
IS FLAWED. I THINK IT NEEDS

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:10.535
WORK AND I DON'T WANT THE- THE

02:25:10.601 --> 02:25:12.236
NOTION THAT THAT MIGHT BE

02:25:12.303 --> 02:25:14.539
FLAWED TO STOP THE BILL AND

02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:16.908
HAVE ANYBODY INTERPRETED IT. AS

02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:18.843
OUR STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT'S

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:20.244
GOING ON IN THAT PART OF THE

02:25:20.311 --> 02:25:22.914
WORLD AND SO WHAT I WOULD

02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:25.650
SUGGEST IS. IS THAT WE MOVE

02:25:25.716 --> 02:25:28.052
THIS BONE BUT WE LET THE AUTHOR

02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:30.121
KNOW HE'S GOT SOME WORK TO DO

02:25:30.188 --> 02:25:32.156
ON THE SIDE THAT'S THE

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:35.259
RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO FIX. AND

02:25:35.326 --> 02:25:38.296
THEN I WOULD HOPE. IF WE SEE

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:40.832
THIS ON THE FLOOR WHO OVER

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.967
ANOTHER TIME THAT THOSE ISSUES

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:44.902
HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BUT- THE

02:25:44.969 --> 02:25:46.804
AUTHOR HAS MADE A COMPELLING

02:25:46.871 --> 02:25:47.572
CASE AND I WANT TO GIVE THEM A

02:25:47.638 --> 02:25:50.842
CHANCE TO. TO ALIGN THE IMPACT

02:25:50.908 --> 02:25:53.077
OF THE BILL WITH THE GRAVITY OF

02:25:53.144 --> 02:25:54.812
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS

02:25:54.879 --> 02:25:56.614
SO DO PROPER TIME I'LL BE

02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:57.915
WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL AND

02:25:57.982 --> 02:26:03.421
THAT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING.

02:26:03.488 --> 02:26:04.021
WITH REGARD TO IT BEING ABLE.

02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:07.625
THE HE'LL BE JUST THAT I. SHE

02:26:07.692 --> 02:26:08.993
THAT ALMOST FEEL LIKE YOU. WE

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:11.095
SHARED A SPEECH OF FOR TODAY'S-

02:26:11.162 --> 02:26:12.930
DISCUSSION NONPARTISAN WHICH OF

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:15.533
COURSE WE BOTH KNOW WE DID NOT-

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.201
IT OUT I'D ACTUALLY EVEN GO A

02:26:17.268 --> 02:26:18.503
LITTLE BIT JUST A LITTLE BIT

02:26:18.569 --> 02:26:21.472
FURTHER AND IT JUST SAY- THAT I

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:24.208
ACTUALLY THINK. THERE'S AN

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:26.210
OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THESE FIVE

02:26:26.277 --> 02:26:28.546
SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:30.081
A ROBUST DEBATE ON ON BOTH

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:31.916
SIDES THERE'S IS A PART OF ME

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:34.585
THAT WANTS TO SEE THIS. OUT OF

02:26:34.652 --> 02:26:37.455
IT INTO THE LARGER FORUM BOTH

02:26:37.522 --> 02:26:39.223
OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS SIDE- AND

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:41.058
I'M NOT SURE THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:26:41.125 --> 02:26:44.529
IS. AVAILABLE THUS FAR BUT BUT

02:26:44.595 --> 02:26:46.264
ALSO IN THIS ISSUE ON THIS

02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:48.166
ISSUE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

02:26:48.232 --> 02:26:49.800
AND AT WHAT POINT DOES HUMAN

02:26:49.867 --> 02:26:53.004
RIGHTS VIOLATION RISE TO THE

02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:56.073
LEVEL OF MORE WE ACTUALLY. TAKE

02:26:56.140 --> 02:26:58.342
THIS KIND OF A OF AN ACTION- I

02:26:58.409 --> 02:27:01.078
AM NOT SOLD ON THAT YET BECAUSE

02:27:01.145 --> 02:27:02.780
I DON'T KNOW THE IMPLICATIONS

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:04.749
AND- I DID HAVE A DISCUSSION

02:27:04.815 --> 02:27:06.250
WITH THE AUTHOR AHEAD OF TIME

02:27:06.317 --> 02:27:08.819
AND INDICATED THAT. RELEASED

02:27:08.886 --> 02:27:10.054
I'D PROBABLY USE THAT WORD ONCE

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:11.455

02:27:11.522 --> 02:27:13.824

HARD WORK THEY WERE DOING TO

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:53.664
TRY TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUES

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:56.334
AROUND UNFUNDED. PENSIONS AND

02:27:56.400 --> 02:27:58.302
SO FORTH HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU.

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:15.987
TO GET THEM OUT- BUT THEY ALSO

02:28:16.053 --> 02:28:18.256

ABOUT. THE UNDERCUTTING OF THE

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:31.869
SYSTEM OF FROM A FINANCIAL

02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:33.337
STANDPOINT I THINK OF ALL THIS

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:35.506
WOULD BE OPEN TO HEARING THAT

02:28:35.573 --> 02:28:36.307
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO

DO THAT IS YOU KNOW- SENATORS

02:28:38.843 --> 02:28:40.211
ANYONE ELSE WISH TO COMMENT

ABSORBING THE BURDEN- AND NOT

02:29:03.034 --> 02:29:05.736
THE STATE- AND SO I THINK IT'S

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:07.538
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO MAKE A

02:29:07.605 --> 02:29:10.574
DISTINCTION. BETWEEN OUR

02:29:10.641 --> 02:29:11.242

BE BASED ON IMPORTANT

02:29:16.013 --> 02:29:17.581
PRINCIPLES SUCH AS THIS. AND

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:19.183

LITTLE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY WHICH

02:29:48.012 --> 02:29:49.547
IS THE HISTORIC HOME OF

02:29:49.613 --> 02:29:51.382
ARMENIANS IN THE STATE AND

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:53.651
PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY IS IN

02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:57.421
MY DISTRICT- THOSE MEN WOMEN

02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:00.057
FAMILIES HAVE SHARED WITH ME

02:30:00.124 --> 02:30:02.226
FOR YEARS WHAT IT IS THAT THEY

02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:03.894
HAVE SUFFERED WITH IT IS THAT

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:05.396
THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH SO I

02:30:05.463 --> 02:30:10.701
FEEL- THEIR STORY HAS GOT IS

02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:12.303
STARTING TO GET OUT. IN A

02:30:12.370 --> 02:30:13.704
SIGNIFICANT WAY THROUGHOUT THE

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:14.972
WORLD AND I COMMEND THE

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:17.842
ARMENIAN COMMUNITY FOR FIGHTING

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:20.978
BACK OF WITH WHAT HAS TAKEN

02:30:21.045 --> 02:30:23.147
PLACE. IN THEIR COMMUNITY WITH

02:30:23.214 --> 02:30:26.450
THE- IN AT WITH THE GENOCIDE SO

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:29.820
I SUPPORT AS BEFORE FIFTY SEVEN.

02:30:29.887 --> 02:30:32.123
I UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL

02:30:32.189 --> 02:30:36.894
ISSUES OF FACING- THE

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:40.164
RETIREMENT FUND I WAS A TRUSTEE

02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:42.900
ON A RETIREMENT FUND FOR MANY

02:30:42.967 --> 02:30:46.003
YEARS- AND WE HAD TO ADDRESS

02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:48.172
SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT ARE

02:30:48.239 --> 02:30:50.040
IMPORTANT TO REFLECT THE VALUES

02:30:50.107 --> 02:30:52.643
OF OUR STATE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT%

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:57.448
IT- WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:59.617
WORKED ON I AGREE WITH SENATOR

02:30:59.683 --> 02:31:00.718
LAYERED AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUES

02:31:00.785 --> 02:31:03.187
THAT THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE YOU

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:06.056
KNOW. YES OR NO THIS IS THIS

02:31:06.123 --> 02:31:07.658
HAS SOME REAL IMPLICATIONS

02:31:07.725 --> 02:31:09.560
WHICH IS PARTLY THE REASON THAT

02:31:09.627 --> 02:31:11.829
HAVE COME BEFORE US BECAUSE IT

02:31:11.896 --> 02:31:13.531
HAS IT SHOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS

02:31:13.597 --> 02:31:16.500
FOR TURKEY FOR WHAT THEY FAILED

02:31:16.567 --> 02:31:17.301
TO RECOGNIZE AND WHAT THEY

02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:20.671
FAILED TO DO SO- IT IS

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.773
UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS A VERY

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:25.409
DIFFICULT DECISION. I THINK

02:31:25.476 --> 02:31:27.278
THERE'S A WAY OF MOVING FORWARD

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:28.679
TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS TO

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:33.150
TURKEY- AND- AND NOT HURT THE

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:37.621
RETIREES NOW WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:42.359
BY TAKING. ONE OPTION OUT. OF

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:44.128
PICTURE DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:46.430
WHOLE RETIREMENT FUND IS GOING

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:49.033
TO GO DOWN THE TUBES- WE'LL

02:31:49.099 --> 02:31:52.436
HAVE TO THE- RETIREMENT BOARD

02:31:52.503 --> 02:31:54.538
WILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW HOW

02:31:54.605 --> 02:31:56.173
TO WORK THAT OUT BUT- IT

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:58.142
DOESN'T MEAN THAT. THEY WILL

02:31:58.209 --> 02:32:01.078
AUTOMATICALLY LOSE THEIR OTHER

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:03.514
INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND AGAIN

02:32:03.581 --> 02:32:05.149
MAYBE I'M MAKING THIS TOO

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:06.283
SIMPLE I'M SURE PEOPLE WOULD

02:32:06.350 --> 02:32:09.153
SAY. BUT I DO THINK IT'S

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:15.092
IMPORTANT- THAT. AND MAYBE SOME

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:17.294
PEOPLE ARE WHO OPPOSE THIS ARE

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:18.496
THINKING THIS IS DOWN A

02:32:18.562 --> 02:32:20.564
SLIPPERY SLOPE WE DO THIS ON

02:32:20.631 --> 02:32:23.400
THIS ISSUE OF THE GENOCIDE OF

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:25.069
ARMENIAN PEOPLE MAYBE WILL

02:32:25.135 --> 02:32:27.905
START PICKING UP OTHER ISSUES I

02:32:27.972 --> 02:32:28.973
UNDERSTAND THAT COULD POSSIBLY

02:32:29.039 --> 02:32:32.142
COME UP. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

02:32:32.209 --> 02:32:35.579
WE SHOULD BOMB. NOT TAKE A STEP

02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:38.782

MY RETIREMENT THAT'S FOR SURE

02:32:51.362 --> 02:32:55.766

COM. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IN

02:35:08.432 --> 02:35:10.034
THE NOW- NUMBER FOUR. UNDER

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:12.102
EXISTING LAW. IT POINTS OUT

02:35:12.169 --> 02:35:15.272
THAT- CALPERS AND CAL STIRS ARE

02:35:15.339 --> 02:35:17.141
ALREADY DOING THIS FOR A RUN.

02:35:17.207 --> 02:35:19.276
PURSUE DONE AND FOR BUSINESSES

02:35:19.343 --> 02:35:20.611
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ISRAEL

02:35:20.678 --> 02:35:22.446
RELATED TO THE ARAB BOYCOTT.

AND ALSO FOR THERMAL COAL

02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:25.749
COMPANY SO THIS IS NOT

02:35:25.816 --> 02:35:27.184
PRECEDENT SETTING. THE

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:29.186
ACCOUNTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN

02:35:29.253 --> 02:35:32.322
PLACE. SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE

02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:34.224
NUMBER TWO WHEN THE ARMENIAN

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:35.759
STUDENT ASSOCIATION WENT TO THE

02:35:35.826 --> 02:35:38.028

TURKEY WITH YOUR INVESTMENTS.

02:35:41.932 --> 02:35:43.934
DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SAID YES.

02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:46.303
AND DID IT SO. WE HAVE ONE OF

02:35:46.370 --> 02:35:47.538
THE LARGEST INSTITUTIONS IN

02:35:47.604 --> 02:35:49.373
CALIFORNIA THE UC I WAS ABLE TO

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.974
DO IT. WE HAVE BOTH OF THESE

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.409
TWO INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:54.945
ABLE TO DO IT ONE TWO THREE

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:56.413
FOUR TIMES ALREADY. SO TO SAY

02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:58.382
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE-

02:35:58.449 --> 02:36:00.350
ACCOUNTING CAPABILITY TO DO IT.

02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:02.453
FRANKLY I FIND THAT. TO BE A

02:36:02.519 --> 02:36:04.688
SUSPECT ARGUMENT I UNDERSTAND

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:05.789
IT'S SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT

02:36:05.856 --> 02:36:09.626
TO DO- BUT THEY'VE DONE IT IN

02:36:09.693 --> 02:36:11.361
THE PAST AND- TWO YEARS AGO THE

02:36:11.428 --> 02:36:13.464
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I

02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:14.932
INSTITUTED A POLICY TO DO IT

02:36:14.998 --> 02:36:18.235
PROSPECTIVELY AS WELL NUMBER

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:20.404
TWO. THE AND I WANT TO

02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:21.038
COMPLIMENT THE SENATOR FROM LOS

02:36:21.105 --> 02:36:25.042
ANGELES. THIS THE SUPPOSITION

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:28.145
THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO FALL.

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:30.547
IF THEY DO THIS I THINK IT IS

02:36:30.614 --> 02:36:32.149
NOT NECESSARILY AN ACCURATE

02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:34.952
DEPICTION OF THEIR PROWESS IN

02:36:35.018 --> 02:36:36.420
MANAGING THE RETIREE'S

02:36:36.487 --> 02:36:39.423
PORTFOLIO AND THE PERCENTAGE OF

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:40.791
THAT PORTFOLIO THAT'S INVESTED

02:36:40.858 --> 02:36:42.292
IN TURKEY RELATIVE TO THE REST

02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:43.160
OF IT AS I SAID IN THE

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:44.661
BEGINNING 70% OF THEIR

02:36:44.728 --> 02:36:46.263
INVESTMENTS ARE U. S. SO WE

02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:47.097
ALREADY START OUT WITH A

02:36:47.164 --> 02:36:49.199
SEVENTY PERCENT. POOL SO THE

02:36:49.266 --> 02:36:50.467
PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL

02:36:50.534 --> 02:36:53.670
PORTFOLIO IS NOT SIGNIFICANT

02:36:53.737 --> 02:36:55.906
WHERE THIS DIVESTMENT IS GOING

02:36:55.973 --> 02:36:57.875
TO AFFECT THE RETIREMENT OF ANY

02:36:57.941 --> 02:36:59.576
OF THESE EMPLOYEES NOR DO I

02:36:59.643 --> 02:37:01.612
THINK THE 30% OF THE SCHOOL

02:37:01.678 --> 02:37:03.313
DISTRICT EMPLOYEES ARE 30% OF

02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:05.149
THE CITY EMPLOYEES IN GLENDALE.

02:37:05.215 --> 02:37:07.851
WOULD WANT THEIR RETIREMENT TO

02:37:07.918 --> 02:37:09.953
BE SUSPECT SO I JUST THINK

02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:14.124
THAT- POSTULATE IS HERE TO

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:16.226
