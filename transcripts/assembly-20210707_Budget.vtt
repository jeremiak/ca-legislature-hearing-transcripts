00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.945
INCREASE IN COSTS FOR

GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.449
ON THE FIFTEEN MILLION-

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.551
APPROPRIATED THE SAN JUAN- SAN

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:55.772
JOB RIGHT DOWN THE LIST ON- SB

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:57.173
ONE THIRTY- CAN YOU PROVIDE THE

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.075
RATIONALE FOR EXTENDING A LOT

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:00.977
OF- THE EXAM THE MORATORIUM ON

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:03.146
NEW CLASSROOM. ANON CLASSROOM

00:53:03.213 --> 00:53:05.215
BASED CHARTERS WAS THERE WAS A

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.516
REASON WHY THAT WAS PUT INTO

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:10.854
THAT TRAILER. CHIU CERTAINLY I

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.622
THINK THAT THE FOCUS OF THE

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.024
TRAILER BILL IN ITS OWN

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.792
RETURNING STUDENTS TO IN PERSON

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:17.661
INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS THERE

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:21.765
ARE PROVISIONS FOR- IN THE

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:23.099
ENHANCED INDEPENDENT STUDY.

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.735
MOST OF WHICH APPLY TO. CHARTER

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:30.807
SCHOOLS. OR OR OR BE ABLE TO

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.176
OUR TRADITIONS SO I MEAN THESE

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:34.644
NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.846
EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC SO I AM

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:39.282
AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- WE

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:40.850
CERTAINLY WANT TO YOU-

00:53:40.917 --> 00:53:43.687
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO GO BACK

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:46.022
INTO THE CLASSROOM BUT IT THAT

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:46.990
IT KIND OF THAT THAT

00:53:47.057 --> 00:53:48.191
PERSPECTIVE KIND OF IGNORES

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.060
REALITY THAT THERE IS NO

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:52.829
QUESTION BUTA SHUTTERS THAT-

00:53:52.896 --> 00:53:55.198
HAVE SERVED- STUDENTS WELL AND

00:53:55.265 --> 00:53:56.600
THE FACT THAT NOW WE'RE IN THE

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:58.868
POST PANDEMIC WORLD WHERE A LOT

00:53:58.935 --> 00:53:59.903
OF PARENTS PROBABLY WANT TO

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.605
KEEP THEIR KIDS IN A CLASS BUT

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:02.739
COULD NOT QUESTION BAY STARTER

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:06.776
SO. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:07.243
WHY THAT MORATORIUM IS

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:11.982
NECESSARY. SO CERTAINLY I THINK

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:13.450
YOU KNOW IT AS I PREVIOUSLY

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:15.018
MENTIONED OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN A

00:54:15.085 --> 00:54:17.621
RETURN JUNE- IN PERSON

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.923
INSTRUCTION. WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.258
GENERALLY CLASSROOM BASED- ARE

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.893
AND HAVE BEEN THE DEFAULT

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.129
OPTION FOR MOST OF. OUR

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:27.564
INSTITUTIONS ROUTE PRIOR TO THE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:32.035
PANDEMIC. OKAY I MEAN I DON'T

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:33.870
BELIEVE THE POINT THAT YOU JUST

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:34.437
GAVE ME THE SAME ANSWER DID

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.906
BEFORE SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.142
QUITE ADDRESS- THE HEART OF MY

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:41.478
QUESTION BUT- I THINK THAT THAT

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.880
THAT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.749
TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THAT

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:46.650
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:48.451
BECAUSE I THINK. LOOK PARENTS

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:49.319
WANT THEIR KIDS IN SAFE

00:54:49.386 --> 00:54:50.720
ENVIRONMENTS AND BECAUSE OF THE

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:51.888
PANDEMIC THEY MOVED THEIR KIDS

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.056
INTO NON CLASSROOM BASED

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.492
ENVIRONMENTS. AND SO WE HAVE TO

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.327
SUPPORT THOSE PARENTS- AS WELL.

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:59.763
IN TERMS OF JUST THE BIG- THE

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:02.298
BROAD DISCUSSION THERE IS A AND

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.533
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ONE

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.634
TIME FUNDING FOR ONGOING

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:06.936
PROGRAMS- WHAT IS THE PAYMENTS

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:10.006
FINANCE WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:10.607
FINANCES PERSPECTIVE ON HOW DO

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.509
YOU ADDRESS. CONTINUING THAT

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.577
FUNDING INTO THE FUTURE ONCE

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:15.178
THE ONE TIME FUNDING IS UP IS

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:19.215
EXHAUSTED. CERTAINLY DEPENDING

00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:20.884
UPON THE PARTICULAR ALLOCATION

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.852
THEIR EXTENDED- EXPENDITURE

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:25.855
ENCUMBRANCE STATES TO ALLOW.

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:27.190
THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED OVER A

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:29.125
MULTI YEAR PERIOD- AND

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:30.727
CERTAINLY AS YOU KNOW THE

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:32.328
BUDGET BELT IN FUTURE YEARS WE

00:55:32.395 --> 00:55:35.198
WILL NOW CONTINUE TO OF REVIEW

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:39.969
AVAILABLE RESOURCE. OKAY-

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:41.504
CERTAINLY THERE AT THAT THAT'S

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.807
A CONCERN- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.709
YOU QUITE THAT I GOT TO THAT HE

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.377
LANDED THAT ONE EITHER BUT I'M

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:48.778
JUST- IT CERTAINLY CONCERNED

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.513
THAT ONCE THE ONE TIME FUNDING

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:53.383
IS- IS GONE FOR THESE ONGOING

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:54.250
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:56.886
LEFT- KIND OF STRUGGLING TO TRY

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:59.522
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT I

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:00.156
AND THAT LEADS ME I GUESS SINCE

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:02.792
YOU-JUMPING TO S. B. ONE SIXTY

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:05.662
ONE- CERTAINLY THE SIGNIFICANT

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:10.100
ITEM THERE IS- WELFARE FUNDING.

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:12.135
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:15.472
THIS MEASURE TAKES THE FIVE

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.807
HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS. IT

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.409
THAT IS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:21.544
ARE IN THAT WAS. PROPOSED TO BE

00:56:21.611 --> 00:56:25.215
AND- NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET AND

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.417
MAKES IT AVAILABLE FOR WILDFIRE

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:29.619
PREVENTION THIS YEAR SO WHAT

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:32.288
CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO

00:56:32.355 --> 00:56:34.424
DETERMINE WHETHER THAT FUNDING

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.760
IS GOING TO BE EXPENDED.

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.561
ASSEMBLY JUST CLARIFY BECAUSE I

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:39.963
THINK I GOT SOME MORE CLEAR FOR

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.364
CLOSURE SO ACTUALLY DISTRICTS

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:44.400
SO- ON. THERE THERE WAS I THINK

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:46.770
CONFUSION ABOUT THE ONE BILLION

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.905
THAT WAS DONE IN AB ONE TWENTY

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:50.874
EIGHT. SO FOR OVER TWO YEARS SO

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.909
THE ONE BILLION OVER TWO YEARS

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:56.012
IS STILL. BEING DONE THE

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:58.381
DIFFERENCE IS WE ANTICIPATE

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:01.251
CONTINUING TO WORK ON A DEAL

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.019
BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.054
SESSION AND FOR THIS COMING

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:09.692
BUDGET YEAR. IN THAT DEAL WILL

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:10.593
BE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND-

00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.628
UNDERSTANDING WORD WORD BEEN

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.730
AND- BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.031
FIFTY MILLION TO SEVEN HUNDRED

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:17.400
FIFTY MILLION- WITH THE IDEA

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:18.701

TWO YEARS WE'RE STILL WORKING

00:57:23.373 --> 00:57:24.808
OUT THOSE DETAILS I THINK

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:27.243

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:34.904
OR FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:36.606
OF GENERAL FUND. HOW WHICH

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:38.408
WOULD BE ON THE TABLE IN TERMS

00:59:38.474 --> 00:59:39.642
OF ARCHITECTURE THAT WE JUST

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:40.376
DESIGNED IN THE BUDGET

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.011
AGREEMENT FOR DISCUSSION ABOUT.

00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:44.080
HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD BE FUNDED

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:44.681
AND WHEN THAT MONEY SHOULD BE

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.549
SPENT IT BASED ON. HOW FAST OF

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.283
THE MONEY THAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.785
PUT OUT. WHICH MEMBER WE PUT UP

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:49.986
THE EARLY ACTION MONEY THAT WAS

00:59:50.053 --> 00:59:52.121
ONLY. TOO HAPPY MONTHS AGO

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:52.755
THREE MONTHS AGO SO WE KIND OF

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:56.225
LOOKING AT THAT. IT'S A WE GET

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:57.927
BACK FROM SUMMER RECESS- AS- AS

00:59:57.994 --> 00:59:59.095
YOU REQUESTED THERE'S- GOING TO

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:00.596
BE HEARING ON WILDFIRES WILL

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:01.464
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.032
THAT. AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.400
WHAT THE EXPANSION LEVELS ARE

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.168
AND WHERE IT WILL BE

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:07.036
APPROPRIATE. TO PUT FUNDING AND

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.271
WHERE THE NEEDS ARE SO THAT THE

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.472
MONEY'S BEST USE BECAUSE

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.140
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A GREAT NEED.

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:13.409
FOR SURE. SO I PUTS THE BY BY

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:14.444
I'M GLAD THAT THAT THE

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.345
OVERSIGHT HEARING IS GOING TO

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.013
BE- THERE'S GONNA TAKE PLACE I

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:17.780
THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.115
THAT TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY TO

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:20.950
KNOW- WHAT THE CAPACITY IS AND

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:23.486
WHAT'S BEING DONE. FOR SURE-

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.254
BUT I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:26.155
WRAP MY HANDS AROUND THE FACT

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.558
THAT WE- HOPE. AS WE DISCUSS

01:00:28.624 --> 01:00:32.462
THIS- THIS BILL. WHAT HOW MUCH

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.596
MONEY IS. IT SO YOU'RE SAYING

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:36.199
THAT IT'S UP TO SEVEN FIFTY

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:37.734
MILLION FOR THIS. FISCAL BUT

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.602
THIS THIS CURRENT BUDGET. SO

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.237
THIS IS JUST THE ARCHITECTURE

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:42.305
IN WHICH WE'VE SORT OF BUILT

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:43.740
THIS BUDGET PACKAGE IN TERMS OF

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.341
THE ASSUMPTIONS OVERALL AND SO

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:46.542
THAT WE WHEN WE DID BILL THAT

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.877
WE HAVE THESE THIS ASSUMPTION

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.078
ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.147
SPEND ON THIS WHICH WAS IN ONE

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.249
TWENTY EIGHT. AND THEN ONE

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:53.983
TWENTY NINE WAS SORT OF AN R.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.151
FLEXION OF HOW MUCH WE THOUGHT

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.387
WOULD BE IN THIS FISCAL VERSUS

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.921
PEOPLE SO THIS IS TRYING TO

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.490
RESET THE CONVERSATION TO A

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.524
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT HE

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.259
WANTS BEEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.293
LET'S HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.228
WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SPEND

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.596
I GOTCHA I THINK I'M I THINK WE

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:09.065
MAY BE CONFUSING PEOPLE EVEN

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.166
MORE SO I UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.634
THE INTENT HERE IS TO YOU KNOW

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:13.136
THAT. THIS THIS ENTIRE CONTROL

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.570
SECTION IS ABOUT. FUTURE

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.239
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET.

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:18.041
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. THE ACTUAL

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.675
PROPOSALS WE HAVE TO COME BACK.

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.177
AFTER THAT. AND HAVE A

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.845
CONVERSATION ABSOLUTE SO THEN

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.147
WILL. IN IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.681
BEING NEGOTIATED. NOW OR WHAT

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.750
WE WERE NEGOTIATING. THAT THAT

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.018
I CAN'T THAT AMOUNT OF

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.387
RESOURCES. IS UP TO SEVEN FIFTY

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:34.023
MILLION. THAT IS SET ASIDE

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:34.657
RIGHT NOW SO IS THAT RIGHT YEAH

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:37.226
OKAY- OKAY THAT THAT'S WHERE I

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:38.628
DIDN'T A PART OF WHAT WE'RE

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:40.496
DETERMINING PROBABLE CAUSE AND

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:41.998
THAT DETERMINATION. ACTUALLY

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.966
WHAT CAN BE SPENT RIGHT SO I

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.535
THINK IT'S ALSO TRYING TO

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.970
REALLY UNDERSTAND- THAT THAT'S

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.073
A KEY COMPONENT IS WHAT'S WHAT

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.541
REALISTICALLY COULD BE SPENT ON

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.743
ESTRADA. SAID THEN IF I COULD

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:56.045
FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT THAT- AT

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.748
THE NUMBERS AND IF THE IF THE

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.217
GOAL IS A BILLION DOLLARS. I'M

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.885
ASSUMING A GRAPHIC AND THAT IS

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.887
ASSUMING BOTH GENERAL FUND AND

01:02:04.954 --> 01:02:08.191
EUROPE TOGETHER CORRECT- DOES

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.926
SO IF THE SEVEN FIFTY IS JUST

01:02:09.992 --> 01:02:12.662
GENERAL FUND. DOES THAT MEAN

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:13.196
AND IN YOUR ATTIC ARE YOU

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:17.066
ADDING TWO HUNDRED MILLION. I

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:17.667
DID YEAR AFTER THAT HE GETS A

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.235
ONE BILLION. CORRECT AND IN

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.269
ADDITION THERE'S SOME G. DRAFT

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.572
THAT'S ALREADY IN AB ONE TWENTY

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.439
NINE THAT'S FOUR FIVE FIRES

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.006
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT THERE

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.374
WHICH UP GET OFF TOM HEADED OUT

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:27.009
FROM THE EXACT AMOUNT SO. IT'S

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:28.711
ROUGH ABC COMES I THINK A

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:29.712
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BILLION

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:30.780
TOTAL FUNDS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:34.317
HAVE THEM LOT- SO- IN GENERAL

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.852
THAT BUT THE IDEA AGAIN IS THAT

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.220
THAT'S WHAT THE ASSUMPTION IS

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.421
FOR THE ARCHITECTURE FOR THE

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.455
CONVERSATION BUT WE HAVE TO

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:39.922
COME BACK AND HAVE A

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.224
CONVERSATION I DON'T THINK

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.226
WE'RE NOT. REALLY GOING TO BE.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:44.927
LIKE FOUNDED IN EXACTLY BY

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:45.862
THOSE NUMBERS WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.762
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT MAKES

01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:47.997
SENSE BASED ON THE HEARING THAT

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:48.564
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WE GET

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.500
BACK. ATTACHED SO. THAT I AM

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.802
I'M ASSUMING THEN THAT WILL.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.238
FLOW I SHOULD ASSUME. SB ONE

01:02:55.304 --> 01:02:56.272
TWENTY NINE IS NOT SIGNED INTO

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:58.141
LAW YET SO ARE WE ANTICIPATING

01:02:58.207 --> 01:02:59.208
THAT THAT WILL BE SIGNED INTO

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:00.576
LAW. AND THEN WE'RE AMENDING

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:03.045
BETWEEN NINE. THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:04.480
WILL YOU BE AMENDED YOU BE WE

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:05.948
WOULD BE AMENDING AB ONE TWENTY

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.750
EIGHT. THE GOVERNOR HAS UNTIL

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:10.820
JULY TWELFTH TO SIGN OR VETO-

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.022
SB ONE TWENTY NINE. OKAY AND

01:03:13.089 --> 01:03:16.058
THIS BILL AB ONE AB IN SB ONE

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:16.826
SIXTY ONE ENVISIONS THE

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:17.860
GOVERNOR SIGNING ONE TWENTY.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.363
OKAY BECAUSE THIS DOG SO THEN

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:24.100
THIS. SB ONE SIXTY ONE. A MAN.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.701
SB ONE THREE NINE. IS THAT

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:26.736
CORRECT BUT AS TO WHAT'S GOING

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.304
ON IS THE SOON TO BE OR COULD

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:29.805
BE SIGNED. AT ANY TIME BUT-

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:34.644
WE'RE ASSUMING. THAT IS IN LAW.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:35.244
INDOLENT AS WE DISCUSSED THIS

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.346
YEAH. BUT THE- AS THE MEASURE

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:38.814
THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. IT THAT

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.318
THAT THE IDEA IS. OBVIOUSLY

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:45.454
WHAT ONCE WE- ARE ABLE TO AGREE

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:48.057
HAVE AN AGREEMENT THEN ALL THE

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.659
CREAM IT WOULD REPLACE THESE

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:50.726
ASSUMPTIONS OKAY SO THAT WOULD

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.228
BE. LATER THIS THAT WOULD

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.462
BUDGET JUNIOR JUNIOR JUNIOR

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:54.864
THAT WOULD BE THE BUDGET FOUR

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:56.032
POINT OH FIVE POINT OH MAYBE

01:03:56.098 --> 01:04:00.870
OKAY FOR A COMPUTER. OKAY SO- I

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.071
APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION

01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:03.639
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:06.008
IMPORTANT ONE- I THINK THAT. IS

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:08.611
THE GOAL THEN IS WITH DESIGNERS

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.547
AND ONE BILLION OVER THE NEXT

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.481
TWO YEARS. BUT WE'RE NOT WE

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.283
WANT TO FRONT LOAD AS MUCH

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.886
MONEY INTO THIS CURRENT FISCAL

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:19.255
YEAR- WITH THE IT WITH THE

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:19.956
INFORMATION THAT WE GET FROM

OVERSIGHT HEARING TO WHAT THE

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.160
CAPACITY IS. I WOULD REDEFINE

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.928
GOAL AS THE BUDGET AGREEMENT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.730
SET ASIDE RESOURCES FOR BILLION

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:28.998

WILDFIRES AND SO IT'S A YOU

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:32.935
KNOW BASICALLY FOR CONVERSATION

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:33.569
WHEN WE GET BACK ON WHAT WE'RE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:35.338
GONNA DO THAT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.373
THAT IS NOT THE- END OF THE

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.741
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT THAT'S

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:39.809
JUST WHAT WE HAVE IN THIS

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.410
BUDGET AGREEMENT FOR JUNE AND

FIFTY EIGHT. PLUS THE FIVE

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:57.226
HUNDRED MILLION THAT WHAT WOULD

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:57.760
BE ACCESSIBLE THIS CURRENT

01:04:57.827 --> 01:05:00.730
FISCAL YEAR. THE SO WE WOULD BE

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.065

THE WITH THE WITH THE POSSIBLE

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.669
WILDFIRE- PACKAGE BEING

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.537
DISCUSSED THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.439
ALLOCATING SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:15.945
MILLION FOR THIS. FISCAL YEAR.

MILLION. POTENTIALLY DISCUSSED

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.620
ENERGY HERE IF WE WERE GOING TO

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.657
ABIDE BY THE- BY THAT THE

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.692
OBJECTIVES OF SB NINE A ONE. IN

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.494
THE PAST IT JUST FOR ME TO

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.562
CLARIFY IS THAT APPROXIMATELY

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:34.163
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY SO I THINK

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.966
THE ACTUAL NUMBER SEVEN FORTY

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:37.600
EIGHT FOR LACK OF A BETTER THAN

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.236
FORTY CLASSIFICATION. OKAY SO I

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.370
THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THAT

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:44.340
THAT. IS VERY HELPFUL- I THINK

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:45.708
FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.009
MAYBE THIS NOW WITH THIS

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:50.980
CLARIFICATION IS INFORMATION.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:51.614
MY QUESTION THAT FORMER FINANCE

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:52.648
IS. UNDERSTANDING OF THIS

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:54.583
NEGOTIATION THAT'S HAPPENING

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:57.653
FOR AT SEVEN FORTY MILLION-

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.622
WOOD THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.824
AMENABLE TO ALLOWING IF THERE

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:03.392
IS A CAPACITY CHALLENGED FROM

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:07.430
CAL FIRE TO ALLOW- FIRE SAFE

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:10.232
COUNCILS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GPAS

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:11.634
NONPROFITS TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:13.936
<u>UPPLEMENT. THE WORK THAT CAL</u>

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:16.772
FIRE MAY NOT HAVE CAPACITY TO

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:17.206
DO THAT PART OF THE

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:21.310
CONVERSATION. YEAH THIS IS

01:06:21.377 --> 01:06:21.844
STEPHEN BENSON DEPARTMENT

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:25.181
FINANCE. YES THAT'S THAT'S- SO

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:26.615
IF YOU'RE CONSERVING BACK A

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.017
LITTLE BIT SO IF YOU RECALL THE

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.019
EARLY ACTION PACKAGE THAT WAS

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:30.953
THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.521
MILLION THAT WAS APPROVED BACK

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:35.324
IN APRIL. WITH THAT PLAN AND IT

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:36.425
IS IT ALLOCATED SPECIFIC

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.028
AMOUNTS TO DEPARTMENTS AND

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:41.030
PROGRAMS. THAT TYPE OF

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.965
ALLOCATION IS WHAT IS YET TO BE

01:06:43.032 --> 01:06:45.868
DONE. FOR THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:46.435
EIGHT MILLION THAT'S IN THE

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:48.537
BUDGET FRAMEWORK. AND IT WAS

01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:50.906
JUST TALK ABOUT. SO WITHIN THAT

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.641
FRAMEWORK WELL I ASSUME WILL BE

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.143
CONSIDERING THE SAME PROGRAM

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.345
THE SAME DEPARTMENTS- WITHIN

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:57.947
THAT THERE ARE PORTIONS OF THAT

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.749
FUNDING THAT GO OUT IN TERMS OF

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.650
GRANTS TO ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.285
GROUPS AND THEY'LL AND THEY

01:07:03.352 --> 01:07:04.387
WILL BE DOING PROJECTS ARE

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.321
DOING PROJECTS NOW WITH THEIR

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.589
THE ACTION FUNDING IN IT AND

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.090
WILL CONTINUE TO BE. PART OF A

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.625
CONVERSATION FOR FUNDING TO

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.593
FLOW TO THEM TO CONTINUE

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:14.296
PROJECTS SURE. I THINK MY ONLY.

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:16.165
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT. WE'RE

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:18.667
IN THE THROES OF- OF- WILDFIRE

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.102
SEASON RIGHT NOW. SO IF THERE

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:24.407
IS. PROJECTS IF THERE ARE- FIRE

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:25.875
SAFE COUNCILS AND LOCAL

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.643
GOVERNMENTS AND NONPROFIT

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.512
SECOND DO ADDITIONAL WORK NOW.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:31.414
I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.481
WAITING TO ALLOCATE THE TWO

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:34.083
FIFTY EIGHT. WE WOULD BE

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:37.286
EXPANDING. THAT MONEY NOW TO DO

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:40.489
MORE WORK NOW. SO THE WAY THAT

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.624
THE BUDGET IS CURRENTLY

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.826
CRAFTED- ALL OF THIS FUNDING IS

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.928
IN CONTROL SECTION OR SECTION

01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:47.963
NINETEEN POINT FIVE FIVE. AND

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.598
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SEND ANY

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.900
MONEY THAT MANY OF THAT MONEY

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:55.404
OUT UNTIL FUTURE LEGISLATION-

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:57.440
ADOPTS AN ALLOCATION OF THAT

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:58.574
ONE OKAY SO THAT'S ONLY

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.476
INCUMBENT UPON US FOR SURE SO I

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:01.744
HAVE THE PHONE YOU'RE A BUT

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.179
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE FIVE

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:05.147
THIRTY SIX THAT WAS THAN IT

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:05.748
REALLY ACTION ALL OF THAT HAS

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.917
BEEN EXPENDED. IT I DON'T HAVE

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.318
AN EXACT ACCOUNTING FOR HOW

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.786
MUCH IS OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:13.222
BUT YES THAT IS IN THE ACTIVE-

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.757
ACTIVELY GOING OUT THE DOOR.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:16.091
AND I THINK IN SOME CASES

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:16.959
DEPARTMENTS HAVE FULLY

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:18.627
ALLOCATED IN THE WARD SOME OF

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.229
IT OTHERS PROBABLY ARE STILL IN

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:24.066
THE PROCESS. SO WITH THE- THE

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:24.600
TWO FIFTY EIGHT THAT WE'RE

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:25.768
DISCUSSING AND THE ADDITIONAL

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.903
FUNDS THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.072
AT A GENERAL FUND- IS THE

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:31.740
ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO DOING

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.709
SOME SECRET FORMER STREAM. AT

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.511
ATTACHING THAT TO IT TOO TO

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.746
ALLOW MORE THAT MONEY TO. TO GO

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.949
FURTHER. AND TO DO MORE

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:43.219
PROJECTS. SO THE WAY THAT WE

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:44.286
ARE ENVISIONING IT RIGHT NOW IS

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.455
ONCE AN ALLOCATION PLAN IS THIS

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:48.891
IS A GREEN TO AND- ENACTED

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:50.125
THROUGH THE FUTURE LEGISLATION

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.228
THAT'S ANTICIPATED. THEN WHAT

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.230
WE WOULD DO IS AS- AS

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.364
DEPARTMENTS WORK THROUGH THEIR

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:56.799
PORTION OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:57.900
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. AND

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.268
THEY'RE READY TO ACCESS THEIR

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:00.503
PORTION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:01.504
MILLION WE WOULD START MAKING

01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:03.005
THAT FIVE THAT THOSE PORTIONS

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.074
AVAILABLE TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:05.941
WE JUST EXPECT WE EXPECTED

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:09.245
THAT- THE RATE THROUGH WHICH-

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:11.080
SOME PORTIONS OF THAT ARE USED

01:09:11.146 --> 01:09:12.781
WILL DIFFER FROM DEPARTMENT TO

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:13.616
DEPARTMENT FROM PROGRAM TO

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:16.886
PROGRAM. OKAY I THINK THAT MY

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:19.388
MAIN POINT IS THAT. WE WANT TO

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.390
SUPPLEMENT AND COMPLEMENT WHAT

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.658
CALIFORNIA'S DOING CERTAINLY

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.159
THERE'S A LOT ON THEIR PLATE.

01:09:24.226 --> 01:09:25.861
AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.663
CAPACITY CHALLENGES. I THINK

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:30.232
THAT- FOR US AS A LEAD TO THE

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.101
BODY. I AM FOR THOSE TO

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.437
REPRESENT- FIRE REGIONS- ARE

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:37.373
FIRE PRONE REGIONS WE HAVE

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.575
ORGANIZATIONS THAT. ARE WILLING

01:09:39.642 --> 01:09:41.310
TO DO THE WORK NOW THAT HAVE

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.245
THEY HAVE EXTRA CAPACITY. SO WE

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.447
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. THAT THOSE

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.283
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS BE

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.885
MORE ROBUST- TO ALLOW MORE WORK

01:09:49.952 --> 01:09:51.220
MORE ACRES TO BE TREATED MORE

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.288
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TO BE

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.656
DONE. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.691
ENCOURAGING- AND MBANK KIND OF

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:56.892
IMPLORING AND PLEADING FOR THE

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.627
ADMINISTRATION TO DO. IS TO

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.030
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN- AND OF

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:03.365
COURSE- YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:04.767
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:10.639
IRONICALLY IN- THE EDUCATION-

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.240
TRAILER BILL THAT WE DISCUSSED

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.174
SO. WHY NOT. PUSH FOR

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:14.843
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- FOR

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.780
WILDFIRE PREVENTION. IT RIGHT

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:20.816
NOW IN IN IN THIS IN THIS

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:21.884
CURRENT BUT THE SCHOOL YEAR OR

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.052
IN THE ND IN THIS TRAILER

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:25.454
BILLS WAS THAT IT OR IS THAT

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.855
PART OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE-

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:28.157
YEAH AND IN THE WHILE FIRED

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.292
NEGOTIATIONS. IS TO ACTUALLY

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:30.693
PUT IN A CONTINUES

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.529
APPROPRIATIONS. SINCE THE TWO

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.530
THINGS I'LL TAKE UP THERE SO

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:35.998
WHAT ONE OF THE PILLARS TO THE

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.167
WILDFIRE ACTION PLAN THAT THE

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:39.535
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS WERE

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:41.337
REBELS AROUND IS ACTUALLY IS A

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.304
REGIONAL COLLABORATIONS TO

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:44.807
BUILD AND REGIONAL SCALE

01:10:44.873 --> 01:10:46.842
WILDFIRE TREATMENT OF LANDS.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.310
AND SO THAT IS A MAJOR

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.478
COMPONENT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

01:10:49.545 --> 01:10:50.779
ACCOMPLISH HERE AND ANY EARLY

01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.481
ACTION AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.182
LOOKING AT DOING WITH THIS

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.017
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IS GETTING

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.652
THAT INTO SO DEPARTMENT

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.654
CONSERVATION RUNS REGIONAL-

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.289
PROGRAM THAT HELPS TO GET

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.223
PROJECTS SET UP ON A REGIONAL

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.891
SCALE. FUNDING WENT OUT TO

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:04.259
CONSERVANCY SO THEY COULD WORK

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.861
ON A REGIONAL SCALE PROJECTS

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.997
THAT'S ALL PART OF- THE WELFARE

01:11:08.063 --> 01:11:09.031
ACTION PLANS ALL PART OF THIS

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.200
CONVERSATION THE ALLOCATIONS

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.501
THAT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.303
MATTERS WITH THE STRONG PILLARS

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.839
OF THE ACTUAL PLAN IN TERMS OF

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.307
THE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:19.842
QUESTION THAT'S MORE OF A

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:21.076
BUDGET FRAMEWORK BUDGET

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:25.114
ARCHITECTURE QUESTION- I SITE

YOU KNOW. ALL I CAN REALLY SAY

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.349
ON THAT IS WHEN THE BUDGET WAS

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:29.585
DISCUSSED AND NEGOTIATED- THE

01:11:29.652 --> 01:11:30.586
INDIANS FRIENDMARK THE

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:32.221
STRUCTURE THAT WE LANDED ON.

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:33.656
WEST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:34.957

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.199
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IF

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.135
PROJECTS MOVE AT A PACE THAT

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:57.713
DEMONSTRATE. THE NEED TO HAVE

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.280
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAIL

01:11:58.347 --> 01:11:59.848
NOW IS. OKAY WELL I WANT TO BE

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.117
THE POINT HAD OUR- DISK ROBUST

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.118
DISCUSS I THINK THAT. I THINK

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:03.986
WHAT YOU'VE JUST ENDED NO WHAT

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:05.421

WE WANT MORE MONEY AND WE WANT

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.631
MORE CONTINUOUS PREPARATION.

AND WE NEED WE NEED TO

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.234
STREAMLINING TO DO SO BECAUSE

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.103
WE ARE SEEING FIRES IN OUR

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:21.904
REGION RIGHT NOW I MEAN THEY'VE

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.405
BEEN TO FIRES. IN THE KERN

IMPORTANT THINGS- CERTAINLY IN

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.432
THE EDUCATION SPACE. WHAT WE'RE

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.935
ARGUING- IS THAT WILDFIRE

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.570

CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE- I

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:33.108
BELIEVE THAT THE- TRAILER BILL

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:35.244
DOESN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:40.082
THAT ASPECT. THAT SAID HE'S HE

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:42.818
GENERALLY USES REVENUE BONDS TO

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:44.153

ARE WE TALKING TO THE UTILITIES

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:48.804
WHO ALREADY ARE ENGAGED. INTO

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.239
THE AREAS- THAT OF

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.074
RESPONSIBILITY THEY ALREADY

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.609

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:19.167
GAME WITH INVESTMENT FROM THE

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.403
STATE. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.671
THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.974

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.619
AMOUNTS THAT I SEIZE UP. IN THE

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:40.956
SEPARATE COLUMNS- THAT WE WILL

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:42.858
BE ABLE TO HAVE SUCCESSFUL

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.127
OUTCOMES. FOR THE STUDENTS THAT

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.596

AND YOU KNOW THE WIND INTO A

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.834
COMPLETE KIND OF A THE CYCLE

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:55.904
BEHAVIORAL ISSUES HOW ARE WE

NUMBER ONE AND SOME OF THE

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.279
THINGS THAT I DID NOTICE PRIOR

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.782
TO THE PANDEMIC. WHEN I DID GO

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:07.849
INTO SOME OF THE SPECIAL

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.451
EDUCATION CLASSES WAS THERE WAS

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.953

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:16.758
STUDENTS. OF FROM LIKE MAYBE K.

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:19.828
TWO FOUR. AND SO. THEY WERE

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.163
GETTING A KIND OF AN ECONOMY OF

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:22.364
SCALE WITH HER PROFESSIONALS

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.800

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:29.638
THROUGH THEIR ASSESSMENTS

01:18:29.704 --> 01:18:32.841
NEEDED MORE INDIVIDUALIZED IEP

01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:36.711
KIND OF YOU KNOW OF. TREATMENT

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:37.512

WE'VE BEEN NOW THROUGH THE

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:44.052
PANDEMIC AND THEN THERE'S

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.921
REGRESSION AND THEN IF THEY'RE

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.690
THAT SAME PATTERN OF BUNDLING

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:51.059

PART OF THE PROCESS AND SINCE

THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. I

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.885
INTRODUCED A BILL. THEY WOULD

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.019
HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:45.854
DOLLARS CONTINUOUS

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.689
APPROPRIATION FOR FIVE YEARS

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:49.257
AND A SEQUEL EXEMPTION WHICH IS

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.658
THE OTHER THING THAT CAL. WHY

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.961
WE HAVE A BACKLOG. TOM PORTER

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.863
TOLD YOU ON THE ARTICLE. WE

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.297
HAVE A BACKLOG BECAUSE WE NEED

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:58.800
SEEK REFORM WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.902
TO MOVE MORE PROJECTS. IT'S NOT

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.504
AS EASY AS WAVING A MAGIC WAND

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:03.772
TO GO DO THESE PROJECTS YOU GOT

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.240
TO GO THROUGH THIS BURDENSOME

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.409
PROCESS HE SAID THAT. PUBLICLY

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:10.345
IN THE PAPER. WE SHOULD BE

01:24:10.412 --> 01:24:11.679
PAYING ATTENTION THAT IS OUR C.

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:12.647
CORE FORM IN THIS BUDGET

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.482
TRAILER BILL I DON'T KNOW WE'RE

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.184
CHANGING POLICY THAT YOU SEE.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.252
WE CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO DO A

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:19.154
SEQUEL EXEMPTION IN THIS

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:19.754
TRAILER BILL THAT'S THE OTHER

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:22.357
PROBLEM. SO I'VE BEEN A PART OF

01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:24.192
THIS PROCESS AND I'VE SENT YOU

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:26.194
LETTERS WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS.

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.562
I'VE CONTINUALLY SO WHAT I

01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:29.063
THINK NEEDS TO BE DONE. ON THIS

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:32.033
ISSUE. I'M SORRY JUST IT'S JUST

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.935
THAT IT'S NOT GETTING DONE. AND

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.738
WE KEEP ACTING LIKE IT IS WE

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:37.305
DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY LAST

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:40.408
YEAR THAT'S TRUE. WE MADE UP

01:24:40.475 --> 01:24:42.310
FOR EARLY ACTION THAT'S TRUE.

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.245
AND NOW WE GOT TWO HUNDRED

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.180
FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT IS

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.682
DEFINITELY CONFIRMED. FOR THIS

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.484
BUDGET YEAR. AND WHAT AND I

01:24:49.551 --> 01:24:50.185
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.020
TO NEGOTIATE ABOUT WHAT WE NEED

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.621
TO NEGOTIATE MORE ABOUT IT'S

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:55.590
EITHER A PRIORITY IS NOT. PUT

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:58.026
IT IN THE BUDGET. JUST PUT IT

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.494
IF IT'S FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.463
GREAT PUT IT IN THERE. DON'T

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.363
SAY IS DEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.532
NOT THE SAME ADMINISTRATION WHO

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:06.668
HASN'T BEEN DOING THE WORK. AND

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.269
WHO PREVIOUSLY SAID- WE DON'T

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.805
HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY. WE'RE

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.207
GOING TO RELY ON THEM TO ASK

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:14.676
FOR THE MONEY LATER IN THE YEAR

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:15.243
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE GOOD

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:17.812
ACCOUNTABILITY TO ME. AND THAT

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:19.314
IS WHY I THINK WE NEED

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.783
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. THAT

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.551
ENSURES THIS MONEY'S GONNA GET

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.352
SPENT AND WE NEED TO REMOVE THE

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:27.956
BARRIERS TO CAPACITY. ONE OF

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:32.360
THE BIGGEST ONES A SEQUEL. AND

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:33.862
I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO BE PART

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:34.395
OF THE PROCESS BECAUSE I'M

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.130
GONNA BRING AN AMENDMENT AGAIN.

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:39.100
AND ASK YOU ALL TO VOTE FOR IT.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:39.701
TO MAKE THE CHANGE THAT WE ALL

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:43.705
KNOW NEEDS TO BE DONE. THAT'S

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:44.873
THE END OF THE WILDFIRE

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:45.974
DISCUSSION THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.775
WHAT WE'RE REALLY AFTER TODAY.

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:49.511
I'M NOT GONNA GO ASK A QUESTION

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.646
SO I CAN HEAR MORE OBFUSCATION.

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:57.485
FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NOW

01:25:57.552 --> 01:26:05.693
MOVING INTO OUR HIGHER ED. SB

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.361
ONE THIRTY TWO. THE PROBLEM

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:08.196
HERE AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT BY

01:26:08.263 --> 01:26:11.366
THIS QUESTION IS WE'RE TRYING.

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:11.933
I THOUGHT WE ALL BELIEVE IN

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.636
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. I

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:15.970
THOUGHT WE BELIEVED IN THAT WE

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:16.437
BELIEVE IN COLLECTIVE

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:19.541
BARGAINING. BECAUSE IF WE DO

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:21.309
THEN WHY ARE WE TRYING TO IN

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:24.913
THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. MESS

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:25.847
WITH THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.649
BETWEEN THE US BETWEEN THE UC

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:29.484
AND ASKED ME THAT'S EXACTLY

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.218
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE BECAUSE

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:32.620
YOU'RE LEVERAGING UP CAPITAL

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:33.187
OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT NEED TO

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:36.991
GET DONE. NOW WE ALL KNOW NEED

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:39.227
TO BE DONE AT OUR AT OUR UC'S.

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.461
AND LEVERAGING THEM INSANE

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:41.596
UNLESS YOU REALLY MEET THE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.097
DEMANDS THAT'S GOING ON IN THIS

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:44.132
THERE'S ALREADY A COLLECTIVE

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:45.567
BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ASK

ME THERE'S ALREADY A POLICY.

01:26:47.268 --> 01:26:49.203
THAT SAYS THEY CAN'T DO. THEY

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.506
CAN'T CONTRACT OUT. FOR THESE

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:53.608
OTHER SERVICES. AND WE'RE

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.209
ENTERING INTO IT INSTEAD OF

01:26:55.276 --> 01:26:56.144
ALLOWING THAT COLLECTIVE

01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.012
BARGAINING TO CONTINUE AND THE

I GUESS IT'S 65% NOW-

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:18.813

DEBT- THIS IS THE MAY REVISED

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:12.967
PROPOSAL BUT IN ADDITION TO THE

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.468
CONCENTRATION GRANT BEING

01:31:14.535 --> 01:31:16.804
INCREASED FOR LCF THAT WE DID

01:31:16.871 --> 01:31:18.539

CONCENTRATION GRANTS WE- HAD

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:28.950
OVER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS

01:31:29.016 --> 01:31:30.518
IN SPECIAL EDUCATION INCREASES

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:31.886
THAT WERE NOT PART OF THE ME

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.055
REVISED THE HELPS TO SOFTEN THE

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:35.089
INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.791
GRANT VERSUS OTHER SCHOOL

01:31:41.295 --> 01:31:43.030
SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION

01:31:43.097 --> 01:31:47.668
GRANDPARENTS ACROSS THE BOARD

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:48.202
SO WE WERE LOOKING AT THE

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.136
PACKAGE AS A WHOLE. OKAY SO

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:49.971
SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS TO GET

01:31:50.037 --> 01:31:54.775
INCREASED. IS THAT RIGHT AND.

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:55.710
YESTERDAY OUT THERE BEING

01:31:55.776 --> 01:31:57.545
INCREASED AS A AS A SHARE OF

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.413
THE BASE OF LCF FAST AND THEN

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.315
THE- FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING

01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:03.251
PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S GOING TO

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.553
BE AMY ADAMS HELLO FOR FIVE

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.221

SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT ARE

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.958
UNDUPLICATED STUDENTS FOR

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.861
EXPANDED LEARNING PURPOSES SO

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:14.362
THOSE WERE ON DIFFERENT

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:18.366
FORMULAS. OKAY AND THEN THE

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.734
OTHER CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:20.968
THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW THAT

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.204
WE HAVE NOT PUBLISHED A

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:26.407
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD- TO

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.142
ME THIS LEAVES ELEAZAR WHO ARE

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:28.709
FAILING THEIR STUDENTS IN A

01:32:28.776 --> 01:32:30.511
HOLDING PATTERN. WITHOUT

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:32.246
NECESSARILY INTERVENTIONS AND

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:35.116
SUPPORT. AND LEAVE STATE POLICY

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:36.651
MAKERS LIKE US IN THE POSITION

01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:37.652
OF ALLOCATING BILLIONS OF

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:39.921
LEARNING RECOVERY. FUNDING

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.489
BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC

01:32:41.555 --> 01:32:44.692
ASSUMPTIONS AS OPPOSED TO.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:46.594
ACTUAL STUDENT INCOMES I MEAN

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.562
BASICALLY ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:49.697
WE NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.732
AND WAY MORE MONEY GOING OUT

01:32:51.799 --> 01:32:52.333
THERE THAN EVER BEFORE THAT'S

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.169
GREAT. BUT THERE STILL NEEDS TO

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:55.736
BE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'RE

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:58.439
REACHING. STUDENT OUT THE

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:00.708
OUTCOMES AND METRICS THAT WE

01:33:00.775 --> 01:33:02.076
WANT FOR OUR STUDENTS YOU KNOW

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:04.078
AND AT NOWSM THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:06.247
MORE IMPORTANT EVER. BECAUSE OF

01:33:06.314 --> 01:33:07.848
WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH AND WE

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.450
KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN LEARNING

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:11.619
LOSS THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED.

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:13.120
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:33:13.187 --> 01:33:14.655
THAT THE L. E. AS THAT SCHOOL

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:17.391
DISTRICTS ARE. DOING THEIR JOB

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.660
TO GET IT DONE. BY STUDENTS

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:22.296
AND- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:25.199
LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY- IN HERE

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.133
THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY ON

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.102
INDEPENDENT STUDY AT I

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:30.838
APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN. HELPING

01:33:30.905 --> 01:33:31.906
TO ENSURE THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:35.576
IN PERSON. LEARNING BUT

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:36.377
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MAKING SURE

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.313
THAT WERE. ME MATTRESS I THINK

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.750
IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT- AND

01:33:42.817 --> 01:33:44.018
LASTLY I MEAN THIS IS ANOTHER

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:45.619
ONE YOU WANT- FINANCES TO

01:33:45.686 --> 01:33:49.824
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- AS MORE OF

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:51.492
A STATEMENT I GUESS SO AS

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:53.594
OPPOSED TO A QUESTION WELL HOW

01:33:53.661 --> 01:33:55.296
ABOUT CAN I CAN BECAUSE I MEAN

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:56.197
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COULD COULD

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:59.533
TARGET DEPARTMENT FINANCE TALK

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:00.134
ABOUT WHITE THE DASHBOARD HAS

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:05.306
BEEN PUT ON. CERTAINLY I THINK

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:08.009
THAT PART OF THE RATIONALE FOR-

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:10.411
YOU KNOW THAT. THE DELAY ON THE

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.879
DASHBOARD IS THAT SOME OF THE

01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:14.515
UNDERLYING ASSESSMENT- YOU KNOW

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:15.983
WERE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:17.618
THE PANDEMIC CAN CONTINUE TO BE

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:19.487
IMPACTED. SO THAT THERE'S YOU

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:20.654
KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY A TEMPORARY

01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:23.357
PAUSE THERE THAT SAID- THERE OR

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:23.758
THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:25.326
ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS. THAT AT

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:27.128
THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE SUPPOSED TO

PROVIDED TO STUDENTS. BUT BUT

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:36.137
THE CHALLENGE WAS IS THAT WHAT

TWO HUNDRED PAGES FROM MY

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:45.346
DISTRICT SO- EVEN I CAN'T. EVEN

01:34:45.413 --> 01:34:47.548
I HAVE A HARD TIME DISCERNING

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.717
THAT THE WHOLE POINT AS- MR

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.985
GALLAGHER POINT OUT WAS HAVING

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:52.787

COULD LOOK AT THAT THE PUBLIC

01:34:55.656 --> 01:34:57.958
COULD LOOK AT SO. WHY WHY HAS A

01:34:58.025 --> 01:34:59.627
DASHBOARD NOT BEEN PUT UP WITH

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:01.929
THE INFORMATION THAT WE DO HAVE

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:03.130
WE UNDERSTAND THAT. SOMETIMES

01:35:03.197 --> 01:35:04.231
WHEN I GIVEN LAST YEAR THEY

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.200
WERE NOT GIVEN THE YEAR BEFORE-

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:08.502
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT WHY WASN'T

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.070
HE AT LEAST PARTIALLY FILLED

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:14.708
OUT. YEAH I THINK GIVEN GIVEN

01:35:14.775 --> 01:35:16.343
THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:18.212
WAS GOING TO BEING PULLED. UP

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:19.146

A- AND ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:29.290
NOT OCCURRED I'M BECAUSE OF THE

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:30.424
PANDEMIC OR DELAYED BECAUSE OF

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.059
THE PANDEMIC- WE FELT IT

01:35:32.126 --> 01:35:36.397
PRUDENT TO DELAY THE DASHBOARD.

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:37.665
SO WHEN YOU PUT UP THE NEXT

01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:39.166

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:10.464
THE CASE- AND PERHAPS TO GET AN

01:36:10.531 --> 01:36:17.371
ANSWER IS- THE REMOVAL. AT THE

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:19.206

ELIGIBLE FOR THAT SAVINGS

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:46.233

ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS- THAT

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:06.520
WOULD BE MADE- YOU KNOW WHEN A

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:07.988
STUDENT ENTERS FIRST GRADE AND

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.890
IN THE FIRST YEAR IT WOULD BE

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:12.059
FOR ALL STUDENTS IN GRADES ONE

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:13.294

FOR THE DEAF AND THE BLIND.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:31.045
THOSE STUDENTS DON'T QUALIFY. I

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:34.014

FOUND IN THE PREVIOUS BILL

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:02.810

THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER

BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF.

01:38:14.588 --> 01:38:18.325
SURE. I'M GOING TO BE VERY

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.227
NEARLY FOCUS MY COMMENTS ARE

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.329
JUST ONE PART OF THE BUDGET-

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:27.234
DIRECTLY RELATE. TO AND MY ANA.

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.003
OKAY I'M A VERY NEARLY DIRECTOR

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:31.505
OF MY COMMENTS OF ONE PART OF

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.374
THE BUDGET- ONE WE HAVE A

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.908
RESPONSIBILITY ALL OF US ON THE

01:38:34.975 --> 01:38:35.943
BUDGET COMMITTEE ALL OF US IN

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:38.045
THE LEGISLATURE. TO MAKE SURE

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:41.048
THAT- WE TRY TO CREATE AS MUCH

01:38:41.115 --> 01:38:42.383
ACCOUNTABILITY AS WE POSSIBLY

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:44.285
CAN EACH YEAR WHEN WE ADOPTED

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:45.786
BUDGET AND THAT MEANS REVIEWING

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:47.221
HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT LAST

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:49.089
YEAR. HOW EFFECTIVELY WAS THAT

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:50.891
MONEY SPENT AND WHAT SHOULD WE

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.526
DO DIFFERENTLY A WITH

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.061
ALLOCATIONS IN TERMS OF GOING

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.297
FORWARD AND WHEN YOU HAVE

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.565
ONGOING COMMITMENT TO FUNDING

01:38:58.632 --> 01:38:59.933
IT JUST MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.902
AND MORE CHALLENGING- TO DO

01:39:01.969 --> 01:39:03.704
THAT KIND OF OVERSIGHT I'M NOT

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.005
SAYING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SOME

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.640
ONGOING COMMITMENT. BUT WHEN

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:07.341
YOU HAVE IT I THINK HE

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:09.143
RECOGNIZES STAKEHOLDERS EXCITER

01:39:09.209 --> 01:39:11.145
HAVE EXPECTATIONS AND THEY HAVE

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.713
FEWER EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:15.082
ACCOUNTABILITY. UP IN TERMS OF

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:17.084
FIRE PREVENTION SPENDING- I

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.952
CERTAINLY COME FROM AS MANY OF

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:21.789
US TO VERY HIGH FIRE. RISK

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:23.357
AREA- WE'VE HAD SOME

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.893
TREMENDOUS- FIRES IN IN THE

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:28.395
AREA- AND I AM VERY INTERESTED

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:31.398
IN FIRE PREVENTION- SPENDING IT

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.400
IN IN THE BUDGET- BUT I WOULD

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:35.336
OFFER I RAISE THIS ISSUE OF MY

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:36.603
VERY FIRST BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.639
HEARING AND THAT IS THAT. THE

01:39:38.706 --> 01:39:40.441
SCIENCE OF THE POLICY ON FIRE

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:42.409
PREVENTION IS CERTAINLY TO ME

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:44.378
PRETTY SQUISHY. IT'S PRETTY

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:46.780
HARD TO SAY WHAT IS THE BEST

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.715
EXPENDITURE OF FIRE PREVENTION

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:49.917
MONEY. AND I THINK IT'S NOT

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:51.352
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A MAJOR

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:53.787
FOCUS- IN THE PAST AND SO I

01:39:53.854 --> 01:39:55.489
THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE FOR

01:39:55.556 --> 01:39:57.958
US TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY. IT'S OUR

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.727
BIGGER RISK BUT WE HAVE THIS

01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:01.795
MUCH MONEY TO SPEND IS THAT A

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.263
YEAR FROM NOW WE HAVE ALL KINDS

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.232
OF STORIES ABOUT HOW MONEY WAS

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.167
WASTED NOT SPENT WELL LOOK

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:09.169
CENTER AND SO THE IDEA THAT

01:40:09.236 --> 01:40:11.138
THIS IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:12.940
WHICH IS TO TRY TO. MOVE

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:14.708
METHODICALLY AND MAKE SURE WE

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.377
GET MAXIMUM BANG FOR THE BUCK

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:18.379
IS ONE THAT I THINK MAKES SENSE

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:19.913
EVEN THOUGH I AM FROM AN AREA

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.882
THAT DEBT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:22.983
YOU KNOW THE MORE MONEY FOR

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:24.251
FIRE PREVENTION TO SORT OF

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.086
BETTER IT IS POLITICALLY- BUT I

01:40:26.153 --> 01:40:28.155
THINK WE HAVE A LONGER RANGE

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.857
RESPONSIBILITY. AND THAT IS TO

01:40:29.923 --> 01:40:33.227
MAKE SURE WE DO IT RESPONSIBLY

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.294
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU
